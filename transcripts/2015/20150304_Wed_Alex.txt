[00:00:04.895 --> 00:00:06.216]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.216 --> 00:00:07.977]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:07.977 --> 00:00:09.738]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.738 --> 00:00:11.319]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.319 --> 00:00:12.860]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:17.042]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.042 --> 00:00:24.607]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:24.607 --> 00:00:27.709]  Well, it's another live worldwide transmission.
[00:00:27.709 --> 00:00:30.831]  Completely jam-packed and overflowing with key information.
[00:00:32.776 --> 00:00:35.918]  It is already the fourth day of March 2015.
[00:00:35.918 --> 00:00:38.259]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:00:38.259 --> 00:01:01.554]  Wolfgang Halbig, the former state police officer, former customs officer, former top school safety consultant in the country, one of the top guys, Good Morning America, you name it, one of the most successful businesses, providing training and preparation for school security, has been investigating Sandy Hook and believes it's completely fake, completely staged.
[00:01:03.052 --> 00:01:05.393]  is going to be joining us with new developments.
[00:01:05.393 --> 00:01:18.639]  A few weeks ago, there were moves by one of the charity groups associated with Sandy Hook and the reported tragedy there to shut down our YouTube channel for even daring talking about it.
[00:01:18.639 --> 00:01:23.001]  It is the contention of the group that even talking about it is not allowed.
[00:01:23.001 --> 00:01:28.504]  It's kind of an example of the new political correctness where if you disagree with someone, their speech is taken.
[00:01:28.504 --> 00:01:30.425]  That was overturned by YouTube.
[00:01:31.943 --> 00:01:37.947]  But it is an ongoing, as we filed a counterclaim, but it just shows the ongoing garbage we deal with.
[00:01:37.947 --> 00:01:51.858]  We're not going to so much talk about the attempts to shut up and stifle an investigation and obstruct an investigation as the new developments and the lawsuits that have been filed to get more information on that because governments and groups stage events.
[00:01:53.029 --> 00:02:06.198]  In fact, I have an article here today that is more than 60 examples of admitted declassified false flags and staged events by our government, by other governments.
[00:02:06.198 --> 00:02:09.521]  It's a very important article up on Infowars.com.
[00:02:09.521 --> 00:02:19.328]  That said, a lot of times terror attacks are real, but the response to them is to take the general public's liberties and freedoms and secure the globalist takeover.
[00:02:20.748 --> 00:02:22.769]  And a big example of that is in the news today.
[00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:23.769]  Hacked email.
[00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:27.611]  Saudi money finance Benghazi attack.
[00:02:27.611 --> 00:02:34.534]  And Hillary is in a lot of trouble because the head of the EPA, Sheila Jackson, remember, had to step down a few years ago.
[00:02:34.534 --> 00:02:40.737]  It is clearly illegal what Hillary has been doing.
[00:02:40.737 --> 00:02:49.061]  And it shows it's premeditated because she had her own private server system as well, similar to what the IRS has been caught doing, similar to what the
[00:02:50.606 --> 00:02:53.427]  Different federal agencies have been caught doing.
[00:02:53.427 --> 00:02:56.509]  Clinton ran her own computer system for her official emails.
[00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:58.390]  We're going to be getting into that.
[00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:00.411]  We've got some good news here.
[00:03:00.411 --> 00:03:06.794]  McDonald's new menu policy will only use chickens raised without antibiotics.
[00:03:06.794 --> 00:03:09.155]  Very positive news.
[00:03:09.155 --> 00:03:13.037]  Shows the effect of your buying power and voting with your dollars.
[00:03:13.037 --> 00:03:16.419]  This example could bring down the whole New World Order if people figure it out.
[00:03:16.419 --> 00:03:18.360]  And the good news is they're starting to figure it out.
[00:03:20.404 --> 00:03:26.147]  Pelosi got criticized for not properly bowing to Netanyahu.
[00:03:26.147 --> 00:03:32.650]  Whether you like Netanyahu or not, I mean, the bowing to politicians period makes my stomach turn.
[00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:38.353]  Well, she now says she was near tears throughout the Prime Minister's speech and basically worships him.
[00:03:38.353 --> 00:03:42.695]  So, there she's properly prostrating herself to a foreign leader.
[00:03:42.695 --> 00:03:47.257]  Kind of like when Obama constantly bows down to every other foreign leader he can in the Saudis.
[00:03:49.278 --> 00:03:53.783]  And they're saying, of course, the FBI, that ISIS is in all 50 states and getting set to hit.
[00:03:53.783 --> 00:03:57.507]  Europe will face a new 9-11 within two years, Colonel Qaddafi's son.
[00:03:57.507 --> 00:04:04.554]  And that dovetails with Interpol saying they're getting ready for a new European 9-11.
[00:04:04.554 --> 00:04:12.442]  As best I can tell, there is some jockeying going on where they want to create, and it turns out it's in a Brookings Institute document,
[00:04:13.971 --> 00:04:15.276]  And several others.
[00:04:15.276 --> 00:04:20.333]  A fake split between the US and Israel, so Israel can attack Iran and not have any blowback on the US.
[00:04:21.377 --> 00:04:37.282]  But at the same time, it does appear there's some double-crossing of the Saudis through the West with Iran, and that Benghazi was part of getting that cache of weapons that couldn't be traced into their al-Qaeda fighters' hands, then hold the West hostage with a threat of a new 9-11 attack.
[00:04:37.282 --> 00:04:46.384]  Any way you slice it, it's an order-out-of-chaos situation, the genie's out of the bottle, and who knows what is going to happen next.
[00:04:46.384 --> 00:04:47.385]  As we know, genies
[00:04:48.466 --> 00:04:50.832]  Are very uncontrollable and very destructive.
[00:04:50.832 --> 00:04:53.820]  And the genie of geopolitical destabilization is here.
[00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:56.127]  A very special intro coming up after the break.
[00:04:56.127 --> 00:04:56.608]  Stay with us.
[00:04:58.945 --> 00:05:03.546]  The average person's life is filled with unexpected challenges.

[00:05:28.956 --> 00:05:32.617]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[00:05:32.617 --> 00:05:36.898]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[00:05:36.898 --> 00:05:38.678]  Can you put two and two together?
[00:05:38.678 --> 00:05:46.540]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:47.681]  But for how long?
[00:05:47.681 --> 00:05:54.322]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com, spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[00:05:54.322 --> 00:05:57.143]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:05.028]  Used since before the days of the Roman Empire to support the body's natural systems and enhance overall health.
[00:06:05.028 --> 00:06:09.613]  Introducing the new Infowarslife.com oil of oregano formulation.
[00:06:09.613 --> 00:06:17.323]  A highly advanced nutraceutical form of this key herb that has been traditionally used by civilizations for thousands of years to promote health.
[00:06:17.563 --> 00:06:23.085]  We have now procured the most high-quality and potent forms of oregano oil on the market.
[00:06:23.085 --> 00:06:29.007]  Sourced from top leading manufacturers to ensure a concentrated level of bioactive ingredients.
[00:06:29.007 --> 00:06:37.910]  Extracted directly from the wild herb and sealed in easy-to-use capsules, you will no longer need to endure the burning of liquid oregano on the tongue.
[00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:44.112]  Wild-crafted from the Mediterranean oregano species that experts agree is one of the most powerful and most challenging to acquire.
[00:06:44.532 --> 00:06:49.677]  This winter season, it's more important than ever to secure this true form of oil of oregano.
[00:06:49.677 --> 00:06:53.400]  Now available in our limited first run at Infowarslife.com.

[00:08:14.582 --> 00:08:15.763]  We're live.
[00:08:15.763 --> 00:08:26.153]  And he provides that no one will be able to buy or to sell, except the one that has the mark, either the name of the beast or the number of his name.
[00:08:26.153 --> 00:08:27.614]  Here is wisdom.
[00:08:27.614 --> 00:08:37.083]  Let him who has understanding calculate the number of the beast, for the number is that of a man, and his number is six hundred and sixty-six.
[00:08:37.663 --> 00:08:42.849]  So how close are we to actually having microchips implanted under our skin?
[00:08:42.849 --> 00:08:49.397]  Well, according to the NBC Nightly News with Brian Williams, we might be a lot closer than you think.
[00:08:49.397 --> 00:08:52.341]  More now of our special coverage here tonight, life in the U.S.
[00:08:52.341 --> 00:08:53.322]  in 10 years time.
[00:08:54.071 --> 00:08:54.771]  The year is 2017.
[00:08:54.771 --> 00:09:04.775]  You're rushed to a hospital unconscious with no ID or medical history, but thanks to a microchip under your skin, it's all there.
[00:09:04.775 --> 00:09:09.016]  Science fiction 20 years ago, but a biometric reality today.
[00:09:09.016 --> 00:09:13.738]  In medical news tonight, a chip the size of a grain of rice could save your life.
[00:09:14.378 --> 00:09:17.380]  I've just been chipped myself.
[00:09:17.380 --> 00:09:22.644]  It's not a painless process, but doesn't last too long, not too difficult, minor surgical procedure.
[00:09:22.644 --> 00:09:29.909]  New microchip technology now makes it possible for the emergency room staff to find out about your medical history at the touch of a computer key.
[00:09:30.109 --> 00:09:32.770]  At some point, we're all going to have RFIDs.
[00:09:32.770 --> 00:09:36.891]  It might be even in our fingers, where they require it with everything on it.
[00:09:36.891 --> 00:09:44.173]  Instead of carrying credit cards or money, we will probably be implanted with chips.
[00:09:44.173 --> 00:09:48.894]  And now, RFID microchips like this are being injected into humans.
[00:09:48.894 --> 00:09:52.035]  I'm sorry, sir, did you just say you would get one implanted in your arm?
[00:09:52.035 --> 00:09:53.715]  Absolutely, without a doubt.
[00:09:53.715 --> 00:09:56.296]  Our driver's license will be on the RFID chip.
[00:09:56.296 --> 00:09:59.737]  Our credit card number, all our information will be on this one chip.
[00:10:04.662 --> 00:10:08.584]  The chip is encased in unbreakable glass and is about the size of a grain of rice.
[00:10:08.584 --> 00:10:12.126]  The procedure is done with anesthesia and is relatively pain-free.
[00:10:12.126 --> 00:10:16.669]  It felt pretty scary, but at the same time it felt very modern, very 2015.
[00:10:16.669 --> 00:10:22.212]  The government has just approved the use of a computer chip that would be implanted under your skin.
[00:10:22.212 --> 00:10:26.675]  When complete, everyone will have a unique 12-digit identity number.
[00:10:26.675 --> 00:10:33.959]  If hospitals purchase this detection equipment, the system will most likely start to include more and more people in those communities who will want the chip.
[00:10:34.239 --> 00:10:36.640]  Wow, everybody could have one of those one day.
[00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:39.902]  Does Google now know everything I do and everywhere I go?
[00:10:39.902 --> 00:10:45.245]  Because, let's face it, we like you guys, but you're from Google.
[00:10:45.245 --> 00:10:55.130]  It may be true that 10 to 20 year olds don't want to wear a watch on their wrist, but you can be sure that they'll be far more interested in wearing an electronic tattoo, if only to piss off their parents.
[00:10:55.310 --> 00:10:57.070]  Forget mobile phones.
[00:10:57.070 --> 00:11:01.451]  Your children and grandchildren may well want an implant instead.
[00:11:01.451 --> 00:11:07.833]  You know, when we check out at the grocery store, we'll be swiping our own arm over the scanner.
[00:11:07.833 --> 00:11:10.033]  And that will be something we feel we can't live without.
[00:11:10.033 --> 00:11:17.195]  It would be such a disadvantage to not have the implant that it essentially becomes not optional.
[00:11:17.455 --> 00:11:27.619]  Let's imagine a little bit what the future might look like if I could take your stem cells and put them on a chip, or your stem cells and put them on a chip.
[00:11:27.619 --> 00:11:33.781]  It would be a personalized chip just for you.
[00:11:33.781 --> 00:11:37.183]  It turns over but it doesn't stop.
[00:11:37.183 --> 00:11:40.904]  But the RFID reader antenna is here.
[00:11:40.904 --> 00:11:45.186]  So when I authenticate, the bike powers up.
[00:11:51.724 --> 00:11:52.825]  That's it.
[00:11:52.825 --> 00:12:02.291]  Imagine if some of these machines could be made so thin, light and portable, they could be attached right to the surface of your skin and go wherever you go.
[00:12:02.291 --> 00:12:06.493]  There's some very sophisticated device functionality sitting on my skin.
[00:12:06.493 --> 00:12:11.216]  Welcome to the future, specifically the checkpoint of the future.
[00:12:11.216 --> 00:12:16.700]  It is envisaged that the passenger will be able to flow through the security checkpoint without interruption.
[00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:24.244]  This is what IATA, which is the airline industry trade body, is hoping will become commonplace around the world.
[00:12:24.244 --> 00:12:31.549]  A sort of one-stop shop for security from the curb to the gate, as they say, with dignity.
[00:12:31.549 --> 00:12:35.931]  A microscopic tag being planted in a person's body to track his every movement.
[00:12:35.931 --> 00:12:38.073]  There's actual discussion about that.
[00:12:38.073 --> 00:12:42.075]  You will rule on that, mark my words, before your tenure is over.
[00:12:42.395 --> 00:12:43.896]  Mark my words, huh?
[00:12:43.896 --> 00:12:46.037]  More like the mark of the beast.
[00:12:46.037 --> 00:12:50.860]  Even though it is called a tattoo, there is no need to pierce or puncture the skin.
[00:12:50.860 --> 00:12:53.262]  Instead, the device sticks on.
[00:12:53.262 --> 00:12:57.605]  So what we can do then is we can take this device, laminate it on the skin.
[00:12:57.605 --> 00:12:59.246]  It occurs to me I've got them in my dogs.
[00:13:00.086 --> 00:13:01.646]  Why wouldn't I have them in small children's?
[00:13:01.646 --> 00:13:05.227]  There are also several products available to keep track of children.
[00:13:05.227 --> 00:13:14.469]  Many of them act as emergency cell phones and tracking devices, with some even able to display on a map the places your child has visited.
[00:13:14.469 --> 00:13:17.170]  They told you we're giving you a nano-tracker chip?
[00:13:17.170 --> 00:13:21.010]  Uh, yes.
[00:13:21.010 --> 00:13:26.231]  To think something so small can connect you to everything that matters.
[00:13:26.231 --> 00:13:28.272]  Because I'm in love with my kids' kids.
[00:13:28.272 --> 00:13:28.332]  Aww.
[00:13:31.487 --> 00:13:37.250]  Because my car lost control while driving.
[00:13:37.250 --> 00:13:40.592]  Because now I'm looking out for both of us.
[00:13:40.592 --> 00:13:42.232]  Thank you, Satan.
[00:13:42.232 --> 00:13:46.255]  Because I have diabetes, but it doesn't have me.
[00:13:46.255 --> 00:13:48.176]  Because I'm an idiot.
[00:13:48.176 --> 00:13:51.938]  Because I spend my life in the ER trying to save yours.
[00:13:58.863 --> 00:14:15.805]  Darren McBreen of InfoWars, one of our researchers and host, put that piece together looking at the last six, seven, eight years of propaganda, just a snapshot, a skimming of the propaganda, pushing implantable microchips.
[00:14:15.805 --> 00:14:16.245]  I remember
[00:14:17.746 --> 00:14:45.422]  20 years ago, being on air warning people about the plan to have the Internet of Things, smart dust, RFID chips in all products, RFID chips in all of the swallowable prescription pills, chips in children at birth, brain chips in the military, brain chips to buy and sell, brain chips to travel, chips under the skin to travel, and being called a crazy man
[00:14:47.313 --> 00:15:08.175]  Even though I had DARPA documents that were public, Federation of Scientists documents, all these other statements that this was the world that was being built and that every appliance would have tracker devices in it to then dial into all other devices and surveil everything you do for global carbon taxes.
[00:15:09.036 --> 00:15:19.463]  This was public 20 years ago in 1995, the year I launched InfoWars.
[00:15:19.463 --> 00:15:28.189]  And I would get up there on air and read MIT magazines and read trade publications and read Department of Defense reports that were public.
[00:15:28.189 --> 00:15:32.872]  I would read reports where the Secretary of Defense admitted that we had earthquake weapons, seismic weapons.
[00:15:32.872 --> 00:15:35.393]  It was in Army Times, April 28th, 1996.
[00:15:40.114 --> 00:15:41.315]  97.
[00:15:41.315 --> 00:15:47.079]  And I'm just kind of flashing back here to the thousands and thousands and thousands.
[00:15:47.079 --> 00:15:50.201]  I mean, there's got to be 15 articles a day about this just in today's news.
[00:15:50.201 --> 00:16:04.571]  When I say thousands out of thousands of broadcasts, it's tens of thousands of total admissions of the set global plan to bring in a grid of basically omnipresent surveillance.
[00:16:07.042 --> 00:16:11.666]  To not empower humanity, but enslave humanity.
[00:16:11.666 --> 00:16:16.451]  That's why I think about how far we've come from they'll never try to chip us in 1995 to 1998.
[00:16:16.451 --> 00:16:19.754]  Oh, they're a chip.
[00:16:19.754 --> 00:16:26.640]  If you want to get in all these bars and restaurants and businesses in Europe and other areas, you've got to have a chip.
[00:16:27.930 --> 00:16:32.413]  The Baja Beach Club in Spain, or the Baja Beach Club in Miami.
[00:16:32.413 --> 00:16:39.878]  If you want to get into the VIP champagne room with the models, you've got to have a chip.
[00:16:39.878 --> 00:16:41.359]  Isn't that fitting?
[00:16:41.359 --> 00:16:47.123]  And then, oh, the Mexican Attorney General and over a thousand of his workers have to get the chip.
[00:16:47.123 --> 00:16:49.265]  And now last week, Stockholm.
[00:16:49.265 --> 00:16:54.068]  Microchipped office workers feel very modern using hand-implanted chips to open doors.
[00:16:54.068 --> 00:16:55.169]  That's in the Wall Street Journal.
[00:16:56.431 --> 00:17:01.192]  Just a few weeks ago, February 27th, after we reported it.
[00:17:01.192 --> 00:17:09.255]  And I point that out that we'll report it when it's in a trade publication, and then it's in the Wall Street Journal, the New York Times, saying how great it is.
[00:17:09.255 --> 00:17:19.018]  We'll first report saying they're using drones to spy on farmers and arrest people that build barns in Colorado or have, quote, wetlands.
[00:17:19.018 --> 00:17:21.299]  Oh, you're a kook, shut up, but then they report on it.
[00:17:21.299 --> 00:17:21.799]  Last week,
[00:17:23.609 --> 00:17:24.989]  London Telegraph.
[00:17:24.989 --> 00:17:27.570]  Why your smartphone records everything you say?
[00:17:27.570 --> 00:17:34.992]  They go on to say the terms and conditions show that everything you're saying is being recorded and being sent back to be data-mined.
[00:17:34.992 --> 00:17:38.112]  This is not me telling you this.
[00:17:38.112 --> 00:17:39.753]  And it's a malevolent plan.
[00:17:39.753 --> 00:17:41.473]  It's not a nice plan.
[00:17:41.473 --> 00:17:43.413]  It's not a good plan.
[00:17:43.413 --> 00:17:45.414]  It's a very, very wicked plan.
[00:17:47.008 --> 00:17:56.234]  And that's why they have the war on lemonade stands that Forbes reported on two years ago because the enemy is any independent grassroots operation.
[00:17:56.234 --> 00:18:12.344]  Every few days I see articles in California or New Mexico or Texas or Vermont, this is just the last week or two, where they'll have like these parties where people get together and cook organic food and a few hundred people show up at a ranch house and drink wine.
[00:18:12.344 --> 00:18:15.846]  And then the government every time shows up and says, you can't have
[00:18:17.825 --> 00:18:24.370]  A party, we say, because of donations made to pay for the food, this is a business, and it's not safe.
[00:18:24.370 --> 00:18:34.698]  No, what they don't want is people getting back to being humans, and meeting in private, where it's not a corporate system.
[00:18:34.698 --> 00:18:37.600]  They're annihilating the Amish around the country.
[00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:39.322]  They're annihilating them in South America.
[00:18:39.322 --> 00:18:40.503]  They're coming after them.
[00:18:40.503 --> 00:18:45.487]  The globalists are literally the Borg, literally the Borg, coming after us.
[00:18:46.561 --> 00:18:58.891]  When I say literally, I mean stuff in Star Trek where it's the UN global government, UN flag, UN system, and, you know, the Borg come to assimilate everybody.
[00:18:58.891 --> 00:19:01.913]  That's art imitating life.
[00:19:01.913 --> 00:19:04.355]  That's predictive programming, basically.
[00:19:04.355 --> 00:19:09.299]  Well, I'm not going to be assimilated, and it's not that I'm against technology.
[00:19:09.299 --> 00:19:13.443]  It's that I fundamentally understand
[00:19:14.557 --> 00:19:25.627]  At every level, that this is a premeditated program to get total control, not to empower humanity, but to end humanity as we know it.
[00:19:25.627 --> 00:19:31.352]  Now, I haven't hit the huge stacks of incredible news yet.
[00:19:31.352 --> 00:19:33.294]  We will when we come back.
[00:19:33.294 --> 00:19:36.196]  Hacked email, Saudi money finance Benghazi attack.
[00:19:36.196 --> 00:19:39.179]  Europe will face a new 9-11.
[00:19:39.179 --> 00:19:40.140]  We'll tie it into
[00:19:42.233 --> 00:19:57.259]  Hillary Clinton and her cover-up of her emails that could finally sink the witch, the Teflon witch, Congress' Homeland Security bill to Obama without conditions, police overwhelmingly reject AR-15 cop killer ammo ban, and more.
[00:19:59.033 --> 00:20:01.053]  You hear about it every day.
[00:20:01.053 --> 00:20:03.814]  Another shooting where innocent people lose their lives.
[00:20:03.814 --> 00:20:05.874]  The best insurance is being prepared.

[00:21:58.473 --> 00:22:08.060]  As the New World Order continues to tighten its grip on every facet of our lives, we're all asking ourselves, how can we maintain our independence?
[00:22:08.060 --> 00:22:09.622]  The answer is clear.

[00:22:48.172 --> 00:22:48.572]  Call right now!
[00:22:57.366 --> 00:23:00.668]  I'm really glad my buddy Mark turned me on to Guns80.com.
[00:23:00.668 --> 00:23:03.710]  I gotta tell ya, I didn't want to buy any more firearms.
[00:23:03.710 --> 00:23:06.772]  I didn't want a paperwork trail headed back to Big Brother.
[00:23:06.772 --> 00:23:08.854]  I want 100% privacy.
[00:23:08.854 --> 00:23:10.875]  I want to be an invisible gun owner.
[00:23:10.875 --> 00:23:11.576]  Hello?
[00:23:11.576 --> 00:23:16.439]  So Mark says, hey, you know, Guns80.com, Ghost AR-15.
[00:23:16.439 --> 00:23:17.780]  Ghost means invisible.
[00:23:17.780 --> 00:23:18.260]  Get it?
[00:23:18.260 --> 00:23:19.641]  Ghost AR-15.
[00:23:19.641 --> 00:23:21.082]  Guns80.com.
[00:23:21.082 --> 00:23:23.224]  I got a couple, if you know what I mean.
[00:23:23.224 --> 00:23:24.725]  Go to Guns80.com or call 844-2GUNS80.
[00:23:27.048 --> 00:23:29.910]  My name is Del and I live in El Cajon, California.
[00:23:29.910 --> 00:23:38.796]  I was concerned about my cholesterol readings because I knew that high cholesterol is related to clogging of the arteries and increases the risk for heart attack and stroke.
[00:23:38.796 --> 00:23:44.981]  One day, I heard an ad for Heart and Body Extract and I was skeptical, but I decided to give it a try.
[00:23:44.981 --> 00:23:46.882]  Man, the numbers don't lie.
[00:23:46.882 --> 00:23:55.428]  Learn the secrets of an effective, natural, 100% organic nutritional supplement for a healthy heart and circulation at HBExtract.com.
[00:24:12.301 --> 00:24:24.689]  Richard just pointed out that we should add to that video intro on the Mark of the Beast that we just aired earlier, clips from 1997.
[00:24:29.118 --> 00:24:38.701]  Where I got arrested for demonstrating and refusing a thumb scan, showing how the illegals could basically get driver's license, so it wasn't about security.
[00:24:38.701 --> 00:24:42.203]  The borders were wide open then, they're even more open now.
[00:24:42.203 --> 00:24:49.666]  And that I had my insurance card, my old driver's license, passport, and five other forms of identification.
[00:24:49.666 --> 00:24:50.206]  I had eight.
[00:24:52.506 --> 00:24:54.507]  birth certificate, you name it, and that wasn't good enough.
[00:24:54.507 --> 00:25:06.012]  They wanted my biometric thumbprint because they want to force us off of cash to raise taxes to a point that they bankrupt society.
[00:25:06.012 --> 00:25:14.296]  And they know that when they're bankrupting a society, that will force everyone underground into an underground economy to survive.
[00:25:14.296 --> 00:25:21.740]  So they want those basic survival and adaptations and perseverance skills to be removed.
[00:25:25.839 --> 00:25:45.626]  So just as a primitive human with my head screwed on straight, I recognized, because I was a history buff, the historical repeat with a high-tech integration and overlay that was taking place.
[00:25:45.626 --> 00:25:50.908]  And I knew that our world was being converted to a prison planet.
[00:25:51.837 --> 00:25:56.420]  Hence, the launch of PrisonPlanet.com in 1999.
[00:25:56.420 --> 00:25:59.462]  InfoWars in 1996.
[00:25:59.462 --> 00:26:07.387]  This radio slash TV production system, 1995.
[00:26:07.387 --> 00:26:14.431]  And when I sit here and continually point out, we warned you, we warned you, we warned you, it's not to say we're great guys.
[00:26:14.431 --> 00:26:18.934]  It's to say we're telling you now the rest of the story and where this
[00:26:20.276 --> 00:26:21.772]  Road leads us.
[00:26:25.373 --> 00:26:54.505]  And it leads us to a very bad place indeed, but the mind control, the distractions, the conditioning, the misdirection is so sophisticated that even as pediatric cancers, cancers in children, are up more than 10,000% in the West, even as neurological disorders are up several thousand percent just since the 60s, even as breast cancers are up multi-thousand percentage points, diabetes up multi-thousand percentage points, autism up multi-thousand percentage points,
[00:26:55.461 --> 00:26:59.482]  What is 1 in 25,000 30 years ago, 1 in 56 today?
[00:26:59.482 --> 00:27:03.724]  In fact, guys, will you give me the number on that?
[00:27:03.724 --> 00:27:06.345]  How many thousand percentage points increase that is?
[00:27:06.345 --> 00:27:07.145]  With a calculator?
[00:27:07.145 --> 00:27:10.066]  How do you do that?
[00:27:10.066 --> 00:27:13.967]  Simple equation.
[00:27:13.967 --> 00:27:15.627]  1 in 56, 1 in 52.
[00:27:15.627 --> 00:27:16.468]  They debate the numbers.
[00:27:16.468 --> 00:27:18.128]  They change every year.
[00:27:18.128 --> 00:27:19.069]  It's set to be 1 in 10 by 2025.
[00:27:19.069 --> 00:27:19.629]  But let's say 1 in 56.
[00:27:26.894 --> 00:27:29.735]  How big an increase is 1 in 56 from 1 in 25,000?
[00:27:29.735 --> 00:27:54.386]  Where if there was an autistic person, doctors would travel the country by train or by bus or by aircraft to marvel at the autistic child, to marvel at the unicorn, to marvel at this narwhal of rarity, of rarified research.
[00:27:54.386 --> 00:27:56.287]  The same with children with pediatric cancer.
[00:27:59.414 --> 00:28:00.534]  Who have developed it.
[00:28:00.534 --> 00:28:01.395]  Very rare.
[00:28:01.395 --> 00:28:05.656]  They would come from all over the world to marvel at it.
[00:28:05.656 --> 00:28:09.517]  Now you can walk into any school or walk down the street and see the victims.
[00:28:09.517 --> 00:28:20.180]  I'm going to come back in a long segment and hit all the news, but we're under attack and that's why there's no point in fighting with the low-level minions of the system that are compartmentalized.
[00:28:20.180 --> 00:28:21.700]  They're under attack as well.
[00:28:21.700 --> 00:28:28.242]  We have to transcend the divide and conquer of black against white, Arab against Jew,
[00:28:30.097 --> 00:28:33.579]  Protestant against Catholic.
[00:28:33.579 --> 00:28:35.020]  North against South.
[00:28:35.020 --> 00:28:36.320]  Man against woman.
[00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:40.402]  We have to transcend that and realize the globalists are outside the box.
[00:28:40.402 --> 00:28:41.703]  They've transcended it.
[00:28:41.703 --> 00:28:55.250]  They've transcended it from an evil, anti-human, greedy, selfish, elitist, arrogant, narcissistic, rage-based wings.
[00:28:55.250 --> 00:28:58.912]  On wings of disdain and hatred.
[00:29:00.421 --> 00:29:01.485]  They have scaled the heights.
[00:29:04.537 --> 00:29:05.758]  And we live in their world.
[00:29:05.758 --> 00:29:09.800]  Their compartmentalized, programmed, false reality.
[00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:12.261]  We're being eased into a false reality.
[00:29:12.261 --> 00:29:18.725]  Reality runs parallel to their false reality, but more and more people fall to the matrix.
[00:29:18.725 --> 00:29:20.446]  The proto-matrix.
[00:29:20.446 --> 00:29:26.149]  More and more fall to their smartphones and 10 hours of TV and video games and virtual reality.
[00:29:26.149 --> 00:29:32.893]  As the whole universe goes on around us, and the globalists aren't obsessed with reality TV and diversions, they're obsessed with conquering humanity,
[00:29:34.093 --> 00:29:40.475]  To then merge with the machines, go to the next level, and they believe a sin to godhood.
[00:29:40.475 --> 00:29:43.716]  But for them to do that, they believe we must fall.
[00:29:43.716 --> 00:29:46.657]  They wish to destroy our free will and our destiny.
[00:29:46.657 --> 00:29:48.277]  Stay with us.
[00:29:48.277 --> 00:29:49.677]  We're on the march.
[00:29:49.677 --> 00:29:52.198]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:52.198 --> 00:29:54.879]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:58.996 --> 00:30:06.219]  For all of recorded history, civilizations around the world praised the health benefits of silver.
[00:30:06.219 --> 00:30:15.822]  At InfoWars Life, our mission is to bring you the highest quality, purest, cleanest, effective colloidal silver on the market today for the lowest price available.

[00:30:53.624 --> 00:30:53.964]  Silver Bullet.
[00:30:59.048 --> 00:31:08.033]  Sold out for weeks due to the difficult and extensive proprietary process behind its creation, the exclusive InfoWars Life Secret 12 formulation is now back in stock.
[00:31:08.033 --> 00:31:18.559]  This ultra-clean vitamin B12 nutraceutical has been carefully crafted and developed over the last two years and is based on cellular science of how your body actively absorbs essential nutrients.
[00:31:18.559 --> 00:31:25.003]  Most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic and could not be properly absorbed by the body.
[00:31:25.003 --> 00:31:26.644]  Secret 12 is a binary
[00:31:26.664 --> 00:31:28.886]  Secret 12 is taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.
[00:31:28.886 --> 00:31:30.107]  No needles, no injections.

[00:31:31.928 --> 00:31:32.529]  Discover the secret.
[00:31:48.522 --> 00:31:49.603]  Secret 12.

[00:31:56.065 --> 00:31:57.726]  Alex Jones here.
[00:31:57.726 --> 00:32:09.491]  For the last two years I've been working with top doctors, nutritionists, and chemists to design a nutraceutical formulation that has truly life-changing health benefits.
[00:32:09.491 --> 00:32:14.693]  So many other formulations out there contain toxic ingredients, synthetic additives, and even GMOs.
[00:32:15.053 --> 00:32:18.795]  Introducing the all-new Ancient Defense Herbal Immunity Blend.
[00:32:18.795 --> 00:32:28.339]  Crafted with over 14 key ancient herbs and extracts to supercharge and prepare your body for what experts admit is the most dangerous season of the year.
[00:32:28.339 --> 00:32:39.745]  We have rejected hundreds of other formulations in our quest to bring you what is simply the most powerful and comprehensive proprietary formula that we have ever created in the realm of herbal immunity.
[00:32:39.745 --> 00:32:44.527]  Experience the benefits of combining over 14 ancient herbs and extracts

[00:32:54.112 --> 00:32:54.893]  That's Infowarslife.com.
[00:33:07.830 --> 00:33:14.616]  When I grow up, I want to empower humanity and have my progeny people the stars and go to the next level.
[00:33:14.616 --> 00:33:15.957]  And I'll take you live.
[00:33:27.788 --> 00:33:34.272]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[00:33:34.272 --> 00:33:39.374]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:33:39.374 --> 00:33:50.641]  My dad was over with my mother for dinner on Sunday night.
[00:33:50.641 --> 00:33:54.423]  And he said, will you please stop singing on the show?
[00:33:56.977 --> 00:34:01.039]  He said it's really horrible and it's out of tune most of the time.
[00:34:01.039 --> 00:34:02.380]  You even know how to sing in tune.
[00:34:02.380 --> 00:34:04.041]  Why do you do it?
[00:34:04.041 --> 00:34:06.743]  And I said, Dad, I just can't help it.
[00:34:06.743 --> 00:34:12.707]  And I'm going to continue to do it because I just, I'm teleprompter free and I'm obnoxious.
[00:34:12.707 --> 00:34:19.311]  And that's why people love the broadcast and put up with me is because it's just real.
[00:34:19.311 --> 00:34:22.292]  And I got to have a little bit of fun here or I'll go crazy.
[00:34:22.292 --> 00:34:24.634]  You got to be a little nuts or you might go completely insane.
[00:34:26.078 --> 00:34:33.326]  In a world like this?
[00:34:33.326 --> 00:34:35.448]  Where to begin?
[00:34:35.448 --> 00:34:36.849]  Where to start?
[00:34:36.849 --> 00:34:38.912]  There is so much to cover here.
[00:34:38.912 --> 00:34:42.195]  Well, this all ties into Hillary and to Homeland Security.
[00:34:42.195 --> 00:34:45.539]  I see a connection here to all this little constellation of articles.
[00:34:45.539 --> 00:34:46.540]  So let me hit this first.
[00:34:47.998 --> 00:34:49.519]  This is from Erin Klein.
[00:34:49.519 --> 00:35:08.251]  It's in the emails out of Hillary's private secret email account that she even had her own servers for, showing the premeditated fraud when she was being subpoenaed on information to cover it up, which is called absconding or obstruction of justice, a conspiracy to
[00:35:09.741 --> 00:35:11.883]  Hide criminal activity.
[00:35:11.883 --> 00:35:19.408]  That's why Sheila Jackson had to step down from the command base that she ran there at the EPA.
[00:35:19.408 --> 00:35:29.696]  But all her carbon taxing was because she got caught with a nom de plume, that is a pen name, an alias, and a fake email account.
[00:35:29.696 --> 00:35:35.360]  By fake email account, an email account that was not a governmental account that she was doing governmental business through.
[00:35:36.849 --> 00:35:47.774]  And Hillary has been caught with multiple accounts with nom de plumes conducting government business with a bunch of other aliases and code words.
[00:35:47.774 --> 00:35:58.879]  And I can tell you right now that these code word people are going to be folks like Barack Obama, Michelle Obama, and then Hillary's known girlfriend that is a top administrator in the White House.
[00:35:59.875 --> 00:36:05.501]  That she travels with and has been seen snuggling with in public, which is okay, fine.
[00:36:05.501 --> 00:36:06.982]  Just, you know, don't deny it.
[00:36:06.982 --> 00:36:11.267]  If you're so proud of being a bisexual lesbian, then just announce it.
[00:36:12.611 --> 00:36:14.693]  And eat the same food the kids eat at the school lunch program.
[00:36:14.693 --> 00:36:17.536]  But, you know, I digress from there.
[00:36:17.536 --> 00:36:23.002]  All of this is beginning to come out now, but it ties into this story at World Net Daily right now.
[00:36:23.002 --> 00:36:26.766]  Saudi money financed Benghazi attack hacked email show.
[00:36:26.766 --> 00:36:29.609]  Intel reportedly sent to Hillary by Clinton White House staffer.
[00:36:31.337 --> 00:36:47.513]  An email reportedly sent to Hillary Clinton by former Clinton White House staffer Sidney Blumenthal quotes an intelligence source providing information that wealthy Sunni Islamists in Saudi Arabia funded the September 11, 2012 attack on the U.S.
[00:36:47.513 --> 00:36:49.335]  special mission in Benghazi.
[00:36:49.335 --> 00:36:53.980]  You mean Saudi Arabia funded the takeover of Libya through Benghazi in the two years before that?
[00:36:54.620 --> 00:36:56.782]  And you mean, you mean they're involved?
[00:36:56.782 --> 00:37:02.988]  I mean, as if everyone doesn't already know this, but here it is yet again documented.
[00:37:02.988 --> 00:37:15.380]  The leaked emails were published by Russia Today, which says it was forwarded emails from Blumenthal's AOL account by a hacker using the alias Guccifer, who they've got in prison right now.
[00:37:15.380 --> 00:37:16.281]  What is it, in Romania?
[00:37:17.677 --> 00:37:24.080]  Of course, turns out, as a listener of this show, Guccifer reportedly hacked Blumenthal's email in March of 2013.
[00:37:24.080 --> 00:37:35.925]  Guccifer has since been identified as Marciel Lazar-Leith, a Romanian hacker serving a seven-year sentence for hacking into accounts of Romanian government officials.
[00:37:35.925 --> 00:37:40.727]  He tried to meet with the New York Times and others to give them this, and of course, the New York Times didn't want it.
[00:37:41.727 --> 00:37:43.528]  So guess who does?
[00:37:43.528 --> 00:37:45.028]  The Ruskies!
[00:37:45.028 --> 00:37:51.650]  Doesn't mean the Ruskies are good guys, but that's why separation of powers are good in a government or in a world.
[00:37:51.650 --> 00:37:54.651]  Because national sovereignty acts like a firewall.
[00:37:54.651 --> 00:38:03.014]  And the fact that the Russians will publish this stuff, that the New York Times won't, just like with Snowden, really worries the establishment.
[00:38:04.718 --> 00:38:10.802]  Remember, Guccifer was talking about the Bilderberg Group and global government and what he got out of government officials' emails?
[00:38:10.802 --> 00:38:12.883]  And he admittedly got into hundreds of them.
[00:38:12.883 --> 00:38:15.665]  And now the Russians have it all.
[00:38:15.665 --> 00:38:17.807]  Enjoy yourself, Hillary.
[00:38:17.807 --> 00:38:23.510]  The Russians don't appreciate the jihadis attacking them, trying to destabilize their entire country.
[00:38:23.510 --> 00:38:25.732]  They're going to burn you, witch.
[00:38:25.732 --> 00:38:27.133]  Politically.
[00:38:27.133 --> 00:38:28.634]  Maybe just throw a bucket of water on you.
[00:38:30.503 --> 00:38:38.050]  I'll get you and your little dog too, my pretty.
[00:38:38.050 --> 00:38:42.254]  These things must be done delicately.
[00:38:42.254 --> 00:38:43.375]  Let's continue here.
[00:38:44.827 --> 00:38:51.132]  The leaked emails were published by Russia Today and came from Guccifer, which they've been sitting on.
[00:38:51.132 --> 00:38:53.894]  They will have no wine until it's time.
[00:38:53.894 --> 00:39:05.062]  The alleged memos concern information Blumenthal says he gleaned about the Benghazi attack and the January 2013 hostage crisis at the gas complex in Algeria.
[00:39:05.062 --> 00:39:06.644]  And it goes on.
[00:39:06.644 --> 00:39:09.606]  That dovetails with this little, little doblet.
[00:39:11.417 --> 00:39:14.738]  Europe will face a 9-11 within two years.
[00:39:14.738 --> 00:39:18.060]  Colonel Gaddafi's cousin says they're going all throughout Europe.
[00:39:18.060 --> 00:39:20.861]  Within one year, two years, you will have another 9-11.
[00:39:20.861 --> 00:39:21.721]  He's not threatening.
[00:39:21.721 --> 00:39:29.204]  He's saying the same Al-Qaeda that has been given control of Libya to now make it a failed state, and they go, oh, Hillary screwed up.
[00:39:29.204 --> 00:39:30.205]  No, it was by design.
[00:39:31.767 --> 00:39:38.691]  Now, are saying they're going to 9-11 Europe, and he's agreeing with that, and now the EU says they're bracing for a new 9-11.
[00:39:38.691 --> 00:39:47.835]  The FBI said last week, ISIS and Al Qaeda is in all 50 states suddenly, from being degraded and defeated and destroyed, to just back from the dead like the phoenix.
[00:39:47.835 --> 00:39:48.956]  Frankenstein!
[00:39:48.956 --> 00:39:50.737]  Bigger, badder, meaner!
[00:39:51.517 --> 00:40:05.080]  And the answer is more taxes for Homeland Security and taking your freedoms and spying on everything you do and arresting Tea Partiers and arresting filmmakers and harassing pro-lifers with Homeland Security while the border stays wide open.
[00:40:05.080 --> 00:40:08.721]  That will protect us.
[00:40:08.721 --> 00:40:11.142]  Isn't that just special?
[00:40:11.142 --> 00:40:16.403]  Now that then dovetails with Hillary and her other email scandals that tie into this.
[00:40:18.274 --> 00:40:21.738]  Clinton ran her own computer system for her official emails.
[00:40:21.738 --> 00:40:25.161]  See, that's why Lois Lerner kept saying they lost the emails on a hard drive.
[00:40:25.161 --> 00:40:28.345]  They're always kept on a separate server.
[00:40:28.345 --> 00:40:33.350]  And then they would never say and block subpoenas and wouldn't answer subpoenas about where those servers were.
[00:40:33.350 --> 00:40:37.815]  And then once Congress even learned where they were, Congress suddenly didn't want them.
[00:40:37.815 --> 00:40:39.737]  It's a big blackmail game up there at the top.
[00:40:40.834 --> 00:40:56.661]  The computer server that transmitted and received Hillary Clinton's emails on a private account she used exclusively for official business when she was Secretary of State traced back to an internet service registry to her family's home in New York.
[00:40:56.661 --> 00:40:58.261]  It's Chappaquitta.
[00:40:58.261 --> 00:41:06.645]  According to internet records reviewed by the Associated Press, the highly unusual practice of a cabinet-level official, a highly illegal practice,
[00:41:08.251 --> 00:41:10.092]  Remember they took Obama's BlackBerry away?
[00:41:10.092 --> 00:41:12.113]  Because it could be hacked remotely?
[00:41:12.113 --> 00:41:22.997]  The highly unusual practice of a cabinet-level official physically running her own email would have gotten Clinton, the presumptive Democratic presidential candidate, impressive control over limiting access to her message archives.
[00:41:22.997 --> 00:41:31.901]  It would also have distinguished Clinton's secretive email practices as far more sophisticated than some politicians, because she's been CIA since out of high school, folks.
[00:41:31.901 --> 00:41:34.583]  Including Mitt Romney and Sarah Palin.
[00:41:34.583 --> 00:41:35.383]  And then it just goes on.
[00:41:39.022 --> 00:41:39.983]  To break this down.
[00:41:39.983 --> 00:41:42.244]  Congress will probe Hillary Clinton's emails.
[00:41:42.244 --> 00:41:45.047]  Another headline at a New York Post.
[00:41:45.047 --> 00:41:48.489]  Benghazi Committee says Hillary used multiple personal email accounts.
[00:41:48.489 --> 00:41:49.870]  Politico.
[00:41:49.870 --> 00:41:53.213]  Maybe Hillary Clinton should retire her White House dreams.
[00:41:53.213 --> 00:41:59.597]  National Journal.
[00:41:59.597 --> 00:42:03.020]  Using private email, Hillary Clinton thwarted records requests.
[00:42:03.020 --> 00:42:05.222]  Well, who is Eric
[00:42:06.320 --> 00:42:07.681]  Hottenham.
[00:42:07.681 --> 00:42:12.403]  Clinton's private server listed under a mysterious, untraceable name.
[00:42:12.403 --> 00:42:18.206]  Well, that's what Sheila Jackson did at the EPA, was a bunch of fake names.
[00:42:18.206 --> 00:42:21.227]  This is what criminals do, folks.
[00:42:21.227 --> 00:42:23.488]  Lisa Jackson, whatever the idiot's name is.
[00:42:23.488 --> 00:42:24.288]  Teleprompter Free.
[00:42:24.288 --> 00:42:27.610]  I get these names wrong sometimes.
[00:42:27.610 --> 00:42:31.272]  By the way, were you just on, Ernieco?
[00:42:31.272 --> 00:42:31.752]  I was not.
[00:42:33.886 --> 00:42:40.768]  I will give a cigar to whoever in there when you guys correct me or help me out.
[00:42:40.768 --> 00:42:50.211]  I think it adds to the show when I get something wrong, because I go 100% from memory most of the time, that you pop in and just correct me openly on air.
[00:42:50.211 --> 00:42:52.752]  How many meetings have we had about this?
[00:42:52.752 --> 00:42:54.372]  More than I can count.
[00:42:54.372 --> 00:42:55.573]  You're on air right now, right?
[00:42:55.573 --> 00:42:56.473]  I'm on air right now.
[00:42:56.473 --> 00:42:57.453]  You are awesome.
[00:42:57.453 --> 00:43:00.154]  Nico Acosta does a fabulous job.
[00:43:00.154 --> 00:43:02.015]  I just don't know how
[00:43:04.031 --> 00:43:09.515]  I can get you guys, unless you think something's really inappropriate, I'd like to be corrected openly on air.
[00:43:09.515 --> 00:43:12.838]  Now, I understand you guys want to make sure you're correct, but you usually are.
[00:43:12.838 --> 00:43:14.499]  Be careful what you ask for.
[00:43:14.499 --> 00:43:16.401]  Be careful what you ask for.
[00:43:16.401 --> 00:43:18.602]  Well, let's try it out.
[00:43:18.602 --> 00:43:20.024]  Let's just try what I want.
[00:43:20.024 --> 00:43:21.385]  How's that sound?
[00:43:21.385 --> 00:43:22.285]  Copy that.
[00:43:22.285 --> 00:43:26.068]  Thank you.
[00:43:26.068 --> 00:43:29.211]  Mold count is off the chart today in Austin, Texas.
[00:43:31.041 --> 00:43:37.525]  And it does not really hurt, other than the fact that it makes my voice particularly deep and annoying sounding.
[00:43:37.525 --> 00:43:40.527]  So I'm not trying to sound like this right now.
[00:43:40.527 --> 00:43:43.248]  This is what I sound like.
[00:43:43.248 --> 00:43:44.109]  This is what I sound like.
[00:43:44.109 --> 00:43:47.070]  Most people, when they hold their nose, sound like a mouse.
[00:43:47.070 --> 00:43:52.614]  This is what I sound like when my nose, that actually adds a twang to my speech, is not stopped up.
[00:43:54.542 --> 00:44:04.449]  And I am attempting, as best I can, to not sound like Smog from The Hobbit movie.
[00:44:04.449 --> 00:44:12.795]  You disgusting lake man.
[00:44:12.795 --> 00:44:14.176]  Okay, where to go next?
[00:44:14.176 --> 00:44:16.077]  There is so much to get to.
[00:44:16.077 --> 00:44:19.559]  We do have Wilking Halbig on the latest on the Sandy Hook cover-up.
[00:44:19.559 --> 00:44:22.441]  And I don't know what happened to Sandy Hook, but it's as funny as a $3 bill.
[00:44:26.670 --> 00:44:29.711]  Kind of like somebody's radically swerving down the road, driving crazy.
[00:44:29.711 --> 00:44:36.774]  They're either having a stroke, or an epileptic event, or a diabetic shock, or they've had a half a gallon of Jack Daniels or something.
[00:44:36.774 --> 00:44:41.516]  And if I'm a cop, I'm pulling them over, and I don't know what's going on, but something's going on.
[00:44:41.516 --> 00:44:44.397]  Same thing with Sandy Hook.
[00:44:44.397 --> 00:44:46.858]  Just like 9-11, it is as phony as a $3 bill.
[00:44:50.009 --> 00:44:51.689]  Does that mean I know who printed it?
[00:44:51.689 --> 00:44:52.810]  Who counterfeited it?
[00:44:52.810 --> 00:44:53.950]  Does that mean I know the whole story?
[00:44:53.950 --> 00:44:55.451]  No, I just know it's fake.
[00:44:55.451 --> 00:44:56.631]  They don't make $3 bills.
[00:44:56.631 --> 00:44:58.331]  They make $2 bills.
[00:44:58.331 --> 00:44:59.232]  They make $1 bills.
[00:44:59.232 --> 00:45:00.032]  They make $100 bills.
[00:45:00.032 --> 00:45:01.392]  They make $1,000 bills.
[00:45:01.392 --> 00:45:02.253]  They make $50 bills.
[00:45:02.253 --> 00:45:03.113]  They make $10 bills.
[00:45:03.113 --> 00:45:04.513]  They make $20 bills.
[00:45:04.513 --> 00:45:06.874]  They make $100,000 bills.
[00:45:06.874 --> 00:45:08.334]  What is the biggest bill they make?
[00:45:08.334 --> 00:45:11.315]  Is it $10 million?
[00:45:11.315 --> 00:45:12.716]  I don't know.
[00:45:12.716 --> 00:45:15.096]  Interesting factoid.
[00:45:15.096 --> 00:45:17.317]  But long story short here today,
[00:45:20.488 --> 00:45:22.530]  9-11 has been proven to be a fraud.
[00:45:22.530 --> 00:45:28.053]  Bare minimum of stand down, Saudi Arabia running the attacks, 9-11 commission report, sealed but leaked.
[00:45:28.053 --> 00:45:29.394]  Pretty big deal.
[00:45:29.394 --> 00:45:35.779]  Do we get apologies from the 9-11 truth community who have been demonized, persecuted and attacked?
[00:45:35.779 --> 00:45:38.060]  No.
[00:45:38.060 --> 00:45:47.387]  And now we told you within days of Benghazi that it was Saudi Arabia and a hit to take out the ambassador who was not going along with transferring three warehouses
[00:45:48.892 --> 00:45:58.557]  of high-power kinetic weapons, surface-to-air missiles, anti-tank missiles, you name it, by the tens of thousands to Al-Qaeda.
[00:45:58.557 --> 00:46:15.727]  And he had to be killed so that whatever Al-Qaeda is going to do now, changing their name to ISIS, can shoot down airliners, blow stuff up, hold the West hostage, then the government can take our liberties and freedoms in the name of protecting us, and there's plausible deniability because they were fenced out by a bunch of crazy jihadis.
[00:46:17.674 --> 00:46:27.399]  And that is a big, fat, juicy, false flag in the making.
[00:46:27.399 --> 00:46:30.840]  So, I don't know exactly what they're planning.
[00:46:30.840 --> 00:46:35.343]  I haven't put all the pieces together about what's going on, but let me tell you something.
[00:46:35.343 --> 00:46:37.244]  It's not good.
[00:46:37.244 --> 00:46:38.664]  It's nasty.
[00:46:38.664 --> 00:46:40.085]  It's bad.
[00:46:40.085 --> 00:46:41.866]  It's serious.
[00:46:41.866 --> 00:46:45.928]  And it has world-shaking provocations in the mix.
[00:46:48.260 --> 00:47:04.279]  And if you expand on all of that, you can see how terrorism and a destabilizing global list of proxy war conflicts are going to be used to bring in this planetary regime.
[00:47:04.279 --> 00:47:07.602]  But don't criticize radical Islam in the
[00:47:09.298 --> 00:47:23.407]  Totalitarian, authoritarian, control freak, ivory towers of higher education, where most degrees give you nothing but a giant student loan system that you'll never be able to pay off.
[00:47:23.407 --> 00:47:27.629]  Here's the headline from Campus Forum.
[00:47:27.629 --> 00:47:30.851]  You can't make fun of terrorists at the University of Minnesota.
[00:47:30.851 --> 00:47:34.833]  The Minnesota Republic published a back cover mocking terrorists 2011.
[00:47:36.852 --> 00:47:38.392]  But that doesn't matter.
[00:47:38.392 --> 00:47:43.834]  The University of Minnesota's funding committee said that the cover demonstrated an overt lack of sensitivity.
[00:47:43.834 --> 00:47:50.196]  See, free speech is null when it's not sensitive for the portrayal of members of the Arab world.
[00:47:50.196 --> 00:47:56.338]  So, you could show, you know, a crazy Yosemite Sam and they'd say, that hurts cowboy's feelings.
[00:47:56.338 --> 00:48:00.659]  Such material could, according to the committee, compromise the cultural harmony.
[00:48:00.659 --> 00:48:03.120]  See, your free speech ends when it hurts harmony.
[00:48:03.956 --> 00:48:06.198]  That is cult-like control.
[00:48:06.198 --> 00:48:10.961]  Compromise the cultural harmony of the campus.
[00:48:10.961 --> 00:48:16.485]  No student or student group at a public university should have to fight for their First Amendment rights.
[00:48:16.485 --> 00:48:23.190]  But as I'm preparing for graduation in a few short months, that's exactly what I find myself doing, fighting for the rights of my student publication.
[00:48:23.190 --> 00:48:27.233]  I want to get this newspaper writer, this student newspaper writer on.
[00:48:27.233 --> 00:48:32.897]  At the Minnesota Republic, we pride ourselves on standing up for freedom of speech on campus because we might not exist without it.
[00:48:33.820 --> 00:48:49.393]  In the future, close attention may be paid to the content published by students of the Conservative Voice to ensure that any material that is protected with student fee funds does not compromise, this is a letter, the cultural harmony of the campus.
[00:48:49.393 --> 00:48:58.981]  Our publication, derived from the University of Minnesota Students for Conservative Voice, allows students on campus to share their viewpoints no matter what, even if they are considered offensive.
[00:48:59.775 --> 00:49:11.298]  The image was one of the students sending out a photo saying the Minnesota Republic terrorists hate it with a toy AK-47.
[00:49:11.298 --> 00:49:19.820]  So don't dress up at Halloween as a geisha girl or an Islamic terrorist or anything because it must be politically incorrect and hurt somebody's feelings.
[00:49:19.820 --> 00:49:24.501]  And so now the committee has come out and said that they are not to do that or they will get basically sanctioned.
[00:49:28.148 --> 00:49:34.230]  But they're now questioning the student newspapers headlines as well.
[00:49:34.230 --> 00:49:36.951]  So, there you go.
[00:49:36.951 --> 00:49:40.472]  That's the type of stuff that's going on.
[00:49:40.472 --> 00:49:48.194]  Meanwhile, Congress sends Homeland Security bill to Obama without conditions.
[00:49:48.194 --> 00:49:54.276]  That's right, Obama can do whatever he wants with all the money and can basically direct Homeland Security as a dictator.
[00:49:56.141 --> 00:49:58.062]  Just like on every other front he is.
[00:49:58.062 --> 00:50:09.665]  That way they can have plausible deniability and say that they as Republicans didn't go along with Homeland Security running Obamacare, Homeland Security giving free tuition to illegals, Homeland Security paying to ship people here, Homeland Security engaging on all this.
[00:50:09.665 --> 00:50:12.145]  They can just say, here, you do whatever you want.
[00:50:12.145 --> 00:50:14.306]  And by the way, Bernanke's in the news when we come back.
[00:50:15.396 --> 00:50:17.158]  Bernanke wants the U.S.
[00:50:17.158 --> 00:50:22.042]  President to declare economic emergencies a future crisis and basically take over from Congress.
[00:50:22.042 --> 00:50:30.810]  Paul Joseph Watson wrote about this in 2013 when Obama signed an executive order saying that for any emergency, including economic, he could suspend Congress.
[00:50:30.810 --> 00:50:31.991]  Here's the article.
[00:50:31.991 --> 00:50:36.435]  Ex-Treasury official, Obama could use debt crisis to seize total power.
[00:50:36.435 --> 00:50:38.096]  President could declare national emergency.
[00:50:39.437 --> 00:50:45.524]  Pass executive order, because it's already in place as an executive order that he can put out another order and suspend Congress.
[00:50:45.524 --> 00:50:47.266]  We'll go over that coming up.
[00:50:47.266 --> 00:50:58.139]  And the point is, Congress won't get suspended by the dictator if they go ahead and just become vestigial, ceremonial... well, hindwipers of the dictator-in-chief.
[00:50:59.082 --> 00:50:59.922]  Harvest Right.
[00:50:59.922 --> 00:51:05.963]  The makers of the only in-home freeze dryer would like to present to you their greenhouses that double as emergency shelters.
[00:51:05.963 --> 00:51:07.964]  Their greenhouses simply snap together.
[00:51:07.964 --> 00:51:09.064]  No tools needed.
[00:51:09.064 --> 00:51:11.504]  As a greenhouse, it will stand for decades.
[00:51:11.504 --> 00:51:16.385]  It's incredibly strong, long-lasting, and it can be quickly put up or taken down.
[00:51:16.385 --> 00:51:19.305]  It is also ideal when used as an emergency shelter.

[00:51:29.337 --> 00:51:30.338]  Hey, Boomer!
[00:51:30.338 --> 00:51:33.779]  I learned in school today that 60% of our bodies are made of water.
[00:51:33.779 --> 00:51:35.460]  Good thing we have the Berkey System.
[00:51:35.460 --> 00:51:37.400]  It's the cleanest, best water ever.
[00:51:37.400 --> 00:51:43.242]  Mom says it's because the Berkey's filtration system cleans out the bad stuff and leaves only pure, delicious water.
[00:51:43.242 --> 00:51:44.063]  I know, right?
[00:51:44.063 --> 00:51:45.383]  You love it too!
[00:51:45.383 --> 00:51:46.824]  Yeah, I'm thirsty too.
[00:51:46.824 --> 00:51:47.844]  Let's go get some!

[00:51:58.277 --> 00:52:01.099]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[00:52:01.099 --> 00:52:06.223]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[00:52:06.223 --> 00:52:14.348]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the Charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[00:52:14.348 --> 00:52:18.871]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[00:52:18.871 --> 00:52:22.854]  MyPatriotSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[00:52:22.854 --> 00:52:25.256]  They now operate two distribution facilities.
[00:52:25.556 --> 00:52:28.779]  And employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[00:52:28.779 --> 00:52:31.941]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[00:52:31.941 --> 00:52:37.325]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality, storable foods from My Patriot Supply.

[00:52:57.879 --> 00:53:02.461]  When an emergency happens, you could be left to fend for yourself and your family.
[00:53:02.461 --> 00:53:05.763]  An outbreak of contagious disease can happen anywhere.
[00:53:05.763 --> 00:53:11.166]  Because we're faced with more diseases than ever before, we need a better solution than ever before.
[00:53:11.166 --> 00:53:14.308]  Fortunately, there is a simple, effective way to protect yourself.

[00:54:19.745 --> 00:54:29.453]  And that it's me that likes to talk to and watches you
[00:54:32.682 --> 00:54:34.084]  Monday through Friday, 11 a.m.
[00:54:34.084 --> 00:54:34.564]  to 2 p.m.
[00:54:34.564 --> 00:54:35.586]  Central Standard Time.
[00:54:35.586 --> 00:54:36.367]  We're here live.
[00:54:36.367 --> 00:54:37.728]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:54:37.728 --> 00:54:41.473]  Don't forget, weeknights, 7 o'clock Central, InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:54:41.473 --> 00:54:42.394]  Now, it's subscriber.
[00:54:43.206 --> 00:54:48.388]  The daytime radio slash TV show is free to the public, free to air.
[00:54:48.388 --> 00:54:58.312]  Infowars.com forward slash show to find the high quality video streams, the free audio streams, the free podcast, the free droid apps, the tune in apps, all of it.
[00:54:58.312 --> 00:55:11.218]  And remember, it's key to get that information and spread it to friends and family and neighbors and attach it to your email and just promote freedom and different outlets that tell the truth everywhere you are because we are in an info war.
[00:55:12.486 --> 00:55:14.047]  I've been telling people that for 20 years.
[00:55:14.047 --> 00:55:16.248]  Hillary Clinton started saying it 2-3 years ago.
[00:55:16.248 --> 00:55:18.790]  And saying that she's losing the info war.
[00:55:18.790 --> 00:55:35.480]  And yes, which, Guccifer, keep saying Guccifer, they corrected me, Guccifer broke in, got the intel, has now leaked it, doesn't matter he's sitting behind bars now, he may now single handedly bring down Hillary Clinton with the Benghazi intel.
[00:55:35.480 --> 00:55:38.642]  That's just an example of how you think you're going to take us down?
[00:55:38.642 --> 00:55:40.203]  You're going to get taken down in the process.
[00:55:41.584 --> 00:55:45.805]  So just understand that.
[00:55:45.805 --> 00:55:47.986]  Coming up, I'm going to get into the ex-Treasury official.
[00:55:47.986 --> 00:55:51.808]  Obama could be using debt crisis to seize total power.
[00:55:51.808 --> 00:55:53.268]  Now that ties into the new article.
[00:55:53.268 --> 00:55:54.389]  Bernanke wants the U.S.
[00:55:54.389 --> 00:55:58.010]  President to declare economic emergencies in the future.
[00:55:58.010 --> 00:56:01.531]  So they're starting to float that now, even though it's already on the books.
[00:56:01.531 --> 00:56:05.292]  Nations all over the world confess to carrying out false flag terrorism.
[00:56:05.292 --> 00:56:09.034]  There's more than 60 examples in this article, and I'm going to try
[00:56:11.445 --> 00:56:14.186]  to cover this in the third hour.
[00:56:14.186 --> 00:56:16.267]  It'll probably take me 15-20 minutes.
[00:56:16.267 --> 00:56:17.988]  Well, no, they give 54 examples.
[00:56:17.988 --> 00:56:20.649]  I wrote down 10 more, at least.
[00:56:20.649 --> 00:56:21.730]  They don't even list them all here.
[00:56:21.730 --> 00:56:24.971]  So we're gonna use that article from Washington's blog.
[00:56:24.971 --> 00:56:29.994]  It's up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:56:29.994 --> 00:56:35.656]  Also coming up, will Obama be blamed if reality TV star's murderer is a dreamer?
[00:56:35.656 --> 00:56:36.637]  That is, an illegal alien?
[00:56:37.648 --> 00:56:44.253]  Senator Charles Grassley of Iowa is demanding answers as to whether the suspected murderer of three people is an illegal.
[00:56:44.253 --> 00:56:48.997]  Well, you know they are because there's a cover-up going on of what their status is.
[00:56:48.997 --> 00:56:55.702]  Police overwhelmingly reject AR-15 cop-killer ammo ban, saying it's a total fraud and a way to restrict the Second Amendment.
[00:56:55.702 --> 00:57:05.289]  Major police organizations and groups are tweeting saying, don't use the Constitution, our Constitutional Office, to overthrow the Constitution.
[00:57:05.289 --> 00:57:06.130]  They understand what it is.
[00:57:07.679 --> 00:57:10.821]  They can ban a bunch of 223 folks, they can ban anything.
[00:57:10.821 --> 00:57:18.825]  We're also going to get into Justice Department finds racial bias in Ferguson police practices.
[00:57:18.825 --> 00:57:22.627]  I don't know, in my experience, the police have been so militarized.
[00:57:22.627 --> 00:57:29.410]  If a bunch of people come out and get in their face and there's any looting going on in amongst the group, throwing things at them, it's going to get bad.
[00:57:29.410 --> 00:57:31.331]  And of course the police did do a lot of bad stuff there.
[00:57:31.331 --> 00:57:32.692]  Our reporters were there.
[00:57:32.692 --> 00:57:36.494]  That doesn't mean, though, that we should then go out and shoot police randomly in the head.
[00:57:38.363 --> 00:57:43.265]  Coming up, McDonald's new menu policy will only use chickens raised on antibiotics.
[00:57:43.265 --> 00:57:44.805]  That's a big victory.
[00:57:44.805 --> 00:57:48.026]  That's coming up as well.
[00:57:48.026 --> 00:57:52.687]  Briefly, at the end of this hour, this broadcast is listener-sponsored by people like you.
[00:57:52.687 --> 00:57:53.908]  I want to salute you and thank you.
[00:57:54.685 --> 00:57:59.868]  And to do that, we're offering what's left of the Super Female Vitality that's great for men as well.
[00:57:59.868 --> 00:58:04.271]  The Super Male Vitality Herbal Complex is sold out.
[00:58:04.271 --> 00:58:05.812]  It'll be weeks till we get more.
[00:58:05.812 --> 00:58:07.673]  Super Female is almost sold out.
[00:58:07.673 --> 00:58:10.635]  At current sales rates, it'll be gone in a couple days.
[00:58:10.635 --> 00:58:19.900]  30% off until it's all sold out, because I want you to try it and see how amazing it is, and I know you'll be hooked, and then become a regular buyer of it and help fund our operation.
[00:58:19.900 --> 00:58:21.181]  It's a win-win-win.

[00:58:48.982 --> 00:58:55.204]  Another major health threat, this one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[00:58:55.204 --> 00:58:57.885]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[00:58:57.885 --> 00:59:04.927]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[00:59:04.927 --> 00:59:07.928]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[00:59:07.928 --> 00:59:10.869]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[00:59:10.869 --> 00:59:12.890]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[00:59:12.890 --> 00:59:15.731]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[00:59:15.811 --> 00:59:21.533]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[00:59:21.533 --> 00:59:25.055]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[00:59:25.055 --> 00:59:28.136]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[00:59:28.136 --> 00:59:35.459]  The ProPure ProOne G2.0 Water Filtration System is a must-have for every modern, independently-minded household.

[01:00:04.932 --> 01:00:06.232]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.232 --> 01:00:08.013]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.013 --> 01:00:09.773]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:09.773 --> 01:00:11.353]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.353 --> 01:00:12.894]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:12.894 --> 01:00:17.095]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.095 --> 01:00:21.375]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:21.375 --> 01:00:23.716]  You can follow us on Twitter at RealAlexJones.
[01:00:23.716 --> 01:00:33.518]  You can follow us on one of our 14 different YouTube channels with over 600 million views total by simply going to the Alex Jones channel.
[01:00:34.426 --> 01:00:38.549]  Linked on InfoWars.com.
[01:00:38.549 --> 01:00:45.474]  We have Wolfgang Haubeck joining us for about 40 minutes, coming up at the start of the next segment.
[01:00:45.474 --> 01:00:50.998]  He's the former top school safety administrator, advisor.
[01:00:50.998 --> 01:00:59.805]  He's run major colleges, you name it, run major college security systems, high schools, been a former state police officer, customs officer after that.
[01:01:01.331 --> 01:01:03.333]  He gave money to Sandy Hook.
[01:01:03.333 --> 01:01:04.354]  Then he started to ask questions.
[01:01:04.354 --> 01:01:06.435]  Why weren't the helicopters called for an hour?
[01:01:06.435 --> 01:01:07.456]  Or never.
[01:01:07.456 --> 01:01:09.958]  Why were the ambulances parked down the street?
[01:01:09.958 --> 01:01:12.080]  These are weird press conferences.
[01:01:12.080 --> 01:01:13.441]  Why are you sealing everything?
[01:01:13.441 --> 01:01:15.683]  Why was the school closed until right before?
[01:01:15.683 --> 01:01:16.664]  What are these weird videos?
[01:01:16.664 --> 01:01:19.066]  People walking in circles, in and out, the same people.
[01:01:19.066 --> 01:01:21.848]  And weird guys caught in the woods that you later cover up.
[01:01:21.848 --> 01:01:23.529]  Man, something's going on here.
[01:01:23.529 --> 01:01:28.013]  And then the feds send the state police and others to his house in Florida to threaten him.
[01:01:28.013 --> 01:01:29.114]  He better stop investigating.
[01:01:30.179 --> 01:01:52.998]  Well, we've been threatened in more ways than one here as well, and when people start threatening you, you know you're on to something, and when people threaten me, I gotta be careful that I'm not manipulated and predictable, because in the past, if somebody threatened me, I would immediately go after them, legally and lawfully.
[01:01:52.998 --> 01:01:55.280]  Sometimes, though, people mess with you to get you to do that.
[01:01:56.816 --> 01:02:12.911]  But still, I have a tendency that if somebody tries to shut down my free speech, tries to bully me, I can't sleep at night if I don't get in their face and then basically figure out what they're up to and basically defeat them.
[01:02:12.911 --> 01:02:19.717]  I think most people are like that who've got any common sense, any sense of justice, any self-respect.
[01:02:19.717 --> 01:02:20.618]  But it's not an arrogance.
[01:02:22.346 --> 01:02:24.347]  That I'm engaging and that I don't like being a slave.
[01:02:24.347 --> 01:02:28.229]  It's just my very DNA, my very bones.
[01:02:28.229 --> 01:02:32.331]  Don't like being suppressed, don't like being dominated, don't like being dumbed down.
[01:02:32.331 --> 01:02:35.673]  That's why I fundamentally don't like the New World Order.
[01:02:35.673 --> 01:02:41.737]  Because they take knowledge and use it to control people, instead of taking knowledge and using it to empower people.
[01:02:41.737 --> 01:02:43.958]  Because if you're such a great, incredible globalist,
[01:02:45.868 --> 01:03:01.043]  If you're so phenomenal and so amazing, why then would you need to keep people dumbed down to control them if you were so majestic and so powerful?
[01:03:01.043 --> 01:03:06.088]  Like Yoda says, if so powerful you are, why run?
[01:03:06.088 --> 01:03:10.172]  The government tells us we shouldn't own guns, we shouldn't have storable food, we shouldn't take
[01:03:11.502 --> 01:03:20.566]  Special training with firearms or special training in hand-to-hand combat and self-defense.
[01:03:20.566 --> 01:03:24.367]  And they demonize anybody that does that, and that's why they hate veterans.
[01:03:24.367 --> 01:03:34.171]  Because you're a weapon system that no longer works for them, and you're the apple of their disdain, the apple of their hatred, the apple of their disgust, because they hate you.
[01:03:36.087 --> 01:03:37.848]  Because you're strong.
[01:03:37.848 --> 01:03:39.689]  Because you've done things.
[01:03:39.689 --> 01:03:41.911]  Because you've put yourself out there.
[01:03:41.911 --> 01:03:43.752]  Because you're manly.
[01:03:43.752 --> 01:03:45.533]  Because you're womanly.
[01:03:45.533 --> 01:03:46.874]  You're human.
[01:03:46.874 --> 01:03:49.456]  And the globalists act like a bunch of aliens.
[01:03:49.456 --> 01:03:51.457]  That's because they are aliens, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:03:51.457 --> 01:03:53.839]  I'll just come right down to it.
[01:03:53.839 --> 01:03:55.940]  They're not human as we know it.
[01:03:55.940 --> 01:04:03.265]  And no, I don't believe they came from a distant star system or carried here on seed pods by the solar wind.
[01:04:03.265 --> 01:04:05.667]  From the Horsehead Nebula.
[01:04:05.667 --> 01:04:05.787]  No.
[01:04:07.844 --> 01:04:11.466]  They are psychopaths and sociopaths.
[01:04:11.466 --> 01:04:17.930]  They are mentally ill, with high IQs, and they both see themselves as a separate species because they are.
[01:04:18.905 --> 01:04:22.467]  They are humans, but they are not the same species.
[01:04:22.467 --> 01:04:30.711]  And the globalists are always writing books and have publications saying that the elite are breaking off and forming their own species because they're willing to be cold-blooded and they see us as animals.
[01:04:30.711 --> 01:04:34.553]  No, that does not make you a superior species.
[01:04:34.553 --> 01:04:41.017]  A super morlock overlord species that feeds on the Eloi.
[01:04:41.017 --> 01:04:44.819]  But I will say this, the slouching
[01:04:46.869 --> 01:04:57.161]  Rapproche, that's a proper word, of the general public under the globalist dehumanization onslaught is a disgusting sight to see.
[01:04:59.017 --> 01:05:05.120]  Used since before the days of the Roman Empire to support the body's natural systems and enhance overall health.
[01:05:05.120 --> 01:05:09.722]  Introducing the new Infowarslife.com oil of oregano formulation.
[01:05:09.722 --> 01:05:17.425]  A highly advanced nutraceutical form of this key herb that has been traditionally used by civilizations for thousands of years to promote health.
[01:05:17.665 --> 01:05:23.188]  We have now procured the most high quality and potent forms of oregano oil on the market.
[01:05:23.188 --> 01:05:29.130]  Sourced from top leading manufacturers to ensure a concentrated level of bioactive ingredients.

[01:05:34.092 --> 01:05:38.034]  You will no longer need to endure the burning of liquid oregano on the tongue.
[01:05:38.034 --> 01:05:44.237]  Wild crafted from the Mediterranean oregano species that experts agree is one of the most powerful and most challenging to acquire.
[01:05:44.637 --> 01:05:49.780]  This winter season, it's more important than ever to secure this true form of oil of oregano.
[01:05:49.780 --> 01:05:53.502]  Now available in our limited first run at Infowarslife.com.

[01:05:57.304 --> 01:06:02.126]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[01:06:02.126 --> 01:06:07.209]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors,
[01:06:07.349 --> 01:06:10.371]  And optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[01:06:10.371 --> 01:06:12.333]  Just one of the key compounds.
[01:06:12.333 --> 01:06:15.776]  BioPQQ is backed by major clinical studies.
[01:06:15.776 --> 01:06:18.318]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?

[01:06:58.451 --> 01:07:08.095]  Using unparalleled research in the development of a synergistic formulation based around the key concepts of super oxygenation, the next level in cleansing is here.
[01:07:08.095 --> 01:07:18.020]  With key ingredients backed by real clinical studies, the new Oxy Powder, available through InfoWars Life, was invented during Dr. Group's research on the toxification of our bodies.
[01:07:18.020 --> 01:07:20.941]  Many herbal colon cleansers are harsh on the body.
[01:07:21.161 --> 01:07:21.762]  I think so.
[01:07:36.138 --> 01:07:39.359]  As a community moves towards despotism, respect is restricted to fewer people.
[01:08:06.733 --> 01:08:15.976]  That's veteran Denver Police Officer Charles Jones IV smashing an unarmed suspect in the face six times.
[01:08:15.976 --> 01:08:20.057]  Officers accused of using excessive force on a suspect and then trying to erase the evidence.
[01:08:20.057 --> 01:08:22.778]  I'm observing what they're doing and they're roasting me!
[01:08:22.778 --> 01:08:25.319]  I don't understand what's going on!
[01:08:25.319 --> 01:08:34.582]  A community rates low on an information scale when the press, radio, and other channels of communication are controlled by only a few people.
[01:08:35.501 --> 01:08:43.268]  Does it raise ethical questions about the use of government money to produce stories about the government that wind up being aired with no disclosure that they were produced by the government?
[01:08:43.268 --> 01:08:45.210]  How can you ask such a question?
[01:08:45.210 --> 01:08:47.752]  What difference at this point does it make?
[01:08:47.752 --> 01:08:55.098]  When a competent observer looks for signs of despotism in a community, he looks beyond fine words and noble phrases.
[01:08:55.098 --> 01:09:02.485]  There are actions I have the legal authority to take as president that will help make our immigration system more fair and more just.
[01:09:03.575 --> 01:09:05.836]  Tonight, I'm announcing those actions.
[01:09:05.836 --> 01:09:07.176]  What I say, go.
[01:09:07.176 --> 01:09:08.017]  See?
[01:09:08.017 --> 01:09:09.998]  I'm the law around here.
[01:09:09.998 --> 01:09:14.500]  You came, you saw, you died.
[01:09:17.481 --> 01:09:24.166]  Yes, in modern warfare, our military leaders are finding that words and ideas are highly effective weapons.
[01:09:24.166 --> 01:09:25.987]  We just have to be repetitive about this.
[01:09:25.987 --> 01:09:33.433]  We need to do this every day of the week and just really brainwash people into thinking about guns in a vastly different way.
[01:09:33.433 --> 01:09:35.815]  We are trained to deceive if we have to.
[01:09:35.815 --> 01:09:37.356]  You really don't have to trust me.
[01:09:37.356 --> 01:09:38.177]  You shouldn't trust me.
[01:09:38.177 --> 01:09:42.240]  In fact, by my actually participating in that, I will taint the news.
[01:09:42.240 --> 01:09:45.482]  In communities of this kind, despotism stands a good chance.
[01:09:47.403 --> 01:09:53.386]  Nine most terrifying words in the English language are, I'm from the government and I'm here to help.
[01:09:53.386 --> 01:09:58.669]  Okay, well we're going to do everything we can to help you.
[01:09:58.669 --> 01:10:02.611]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[01:10:02.611 --> 01:10:05.332]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:10:05.332 --> 01:10:08.934]  Because there is a war on, in your mind.
[01:10:08.934 --> 01:10:12.835]  There certainly is, and knowing is half the battle.
[01:10:12.835 --> 01:10:14.036]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[01:10:14.036 --> 01:10:15.777]  We're going to have open phones in the third hour.
[01:10:17.142 --> 01:10:20.225]  There is a lot of news that we haven't even gotten to yet in detail.
[01:10:20.225 --> 01:10:24.289]  Police overwhelmingly reject AR-15 cop killer ammo ban.
[01:10:24.289 --> 01:10:31.876]  It's offensive and disgusting that they are using officer safety as a guise to further infringe the rights of the people.
[01:10:31.876 --> 01:10:34.198]  That was out of Police 1.
[01:10:34.198 --> 01:10:36.300]  We've got some other good news I'm going to get into.
[01:10:36.300 --> 01:10:40.905]  McDonald's new menu policy will only use chickens raised without antibiotics.
[01:10:42.509 --> 01:10:52.798]  Some bad news, Congress sends Homeland Security bill to Obama without conditions, meaning Obama will now completely open the border and has a blank check to do it from Congress without Congress voting.
[01:10:53.649 --> 01:11:05.477]  Just like they did on Obamacare, letting him sign thousands of orders, thousands of waivers and directives to change it, and the power plants, and the gun ammo ban, and everything else.
[01:11:05.477 --> 01:11:12.702]  And meanwhile, three years ago, Obama signed an executive order during any emergency, including economic, to even suspend Congress.
[01:11:12.702 --> 01:11:19.046]  But he doesn't need to, because Congress itself has suspended itself, becoming ceremonial and vestigial.
[01:11:20.674 --> 01:11:25.317]  There is a big movement to remove Boehner, the Speaker, from his leadership role, and that is wonderful.
[01:11:25.317 --> 01:11:29.660]  We need to all get behind that, because this is getting serious.
[01:11:29.660 --> 01:11:36.024]  The Republican leadership just wants to sell the country out, get rich, but be able to blame the Democrats, when they're all part of it.
[01:11:36.024 --> 01:11:37.285]  Here's the article from two years ago.
[01:11:37.285 --> 01:11:43.549]  Paul Watson, ex-Treasury official, Obama could use debt crisis to seize total power, under orders.
[01:11:43.549 --> 01:11:45.951]  You can go read the subsections of that.
[01:11:46.826 --> 01:11:48.566]  That dovetails with a new article today.
[01:11:48.566 --> 01:11:49.787]  Bernanke wants the U.S.
[01:11:49.787 --> 01:11:53.968]  President to declare economic emergencies, close quote, in future crises.
[01:11:53.968 --> 01:11:56.608]  President should get the power to declare economic emergencies.
[01:11:56.608 --> 01:12:01.289]  See, they already have it on paper, but now they're selling it as if, oh, we need it.
[01:12:01.289 --> 01:12:07.170]  Oh, we need NSA spying to keep you safe after it's already on the books.
[01:12:07.170 --> 01:12:13.792]  President should get the power to declare economic emergencies along the lines to declare war to former Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke yesterday.
[01:12:14.841 --> 01:12:21.207]  Presidents should get the power to declare economic emergencies along the lines of declaring war, said former Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke on Monday.
[01:12:21.207 --> 01:12:37.882]  When you get Paul Watson or Adon Salazar, somebody, or Kit Daniels or Curt Nemo or Mikhail Thelen, one of our great writers, to go back to the last few executive orders from two and a half years ago, in fact, I need to actually print the executive orders off.
[01:12:37.882 --> 01:12:39.323]  Here's MarketWatch breaking it down.
[01:12:41.107 --> 01:12:46.290]  That's the current announcement, but I want to get the actual executive order, because I forget the number.
[01:12:46.290 --> 01:12:58.598]  I think the headline from InfoWars, but it was also in other news, was something like, President Obama signs order, and it wasn't an executive order, it was a Presidential Decision Directive.
[01:12:58.598 --> 01:12:59.799]  Obama Directive.
[01:12:59.799 --> 01:13:02.561]  I'm going to give you the exact headline.
[01:13:02.561 --> 01:13:05.323]  Obama Directive gives President power
[01:13:07.466 --> 01:13:13.570]  To declare emergency for any crisis, including economic.
[01:13:13.570 --> 01:13:20.455]  We need to have a new article out tying an end to that, showing how they're now moving to sell it.
[01:13:20.455 --> 01:13:30.723]  And you notice the season on guns, on ammo, on borders, on war, on security, on spying, on energy, on every subject.
[01:13:31.661 --> 01:13:39.006]  It's centralized, it's outside Congress, it's the President and the bureaucracy and the Congress is signing off because it's a premeditated plan.
[01:13:40.816 --> 01:13:42.778]  And with it comes false flag terror.
[01:13:42.778 --> 01:13:47.203]  There's an article on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com that you should send out to everybody you know.
[01:13:47.203 --> 01:13:51.848]  Nations all over the world confess to carrying out false flag terrorism.
[01:13:51.848 --> 01:14:01.118]  50 plus links to mainstream news, not theory, admitted fact, because believe me, this is the next phase of what we're going to see.
[01:14:03.416 --> 01:14:09.357]  But they don't want to have it be Islamic attacks just yet because then we'll say, well, why are you bringing them in at record levels, the radical Islamists?
[01:14:09.357 --> 01:14:10.598]  Why are you protecting them?
[01:14:10.598 --> 01:14:14.779]  Why are you funding them?
[01:14:14.779 --> 01:14:16.859]  It's going to be domestic groups.
[01:14:16.859 --> 01:14:20.640]  They're going to stage events and blame it on domestic groups.
[01:14:20.640 --> 01:14:21.620]  That is what you can see.
[01:14:21.620 --> 01:14:31.883]  All the conditioning in Hollywood and the print media, the fiction, the nonfiction, they are preparing this to shut down their political opposition and kind of shame us
[01:14:33.166 --> 01:14:35.768]  Into, oh, the next mass shooting, a patriot did it.
[01:14:35.768 --> 01:14:39.410]  Oh, a bombing of a mall, a patriot did it.
[01:14:39.410 --> 01:14:43.933]  And the Pentagon admits they're training their main enemy, returning veterans, gun owners, and things like that.
[01:14:43.933 --> 01:14:50.677]  You can see the writing on the wall, an idiot could see this.
[01:14:50.677 --> 01:14:57.361]  And now, that brings me to our guest, a very intelligent man, not an idiot.
[01:14:58.718 --> 01:15:06.500]  But like most of us, believing that other people in government and corporations are like us, not corrupt.
[01:15:06.500 --> 01:15:18.482]  Wolfgang Halbig moved here when he was young from Germany, became a state police officer, then a customs agent, then he started a school safety system, became the head of security for major universities.
[01:15:18.482 --> 01:15:20.623]  His system became one of the most dominant after
[01:15:22.643 --> 01:15:25.887]  The tragedy of Columbine.
[01:15:25.887 --> 01:15:30.672]  He's been on Good Morning America, you know, all the big shows, CNN, you name it.
[01:15:30.672 --> 01:15:33.595]  And then he began to investigate Sandy Hook and it just didn't make sense.
[01:15:33.595 --> 01:15:34.717]  He even gave money to Sandy Hook.
[01:15:34.717 --> 01:15:38.221]  I'm kind of recapping what he's broken down before.
[01:15:38.221 --> 01:15:42.906]  He was the National Executive Director of the National Institute for School Workplace Safety.
[01:15:45.316 --> 01:15:47.340]  And he joins us to break this down.
[01:15:47.340 --> 01:15:50.065]  Facebook.com forward slash Sandy Hook Justice.
[01:15:50.065 --> 01:15:51.708]  SandyHookJustice.com.
[01:15:51.708 --> 01:15:55.595]  He has been threatened to shut up and I don't want to name names because it gives people attention.
[01:15:55.595 --> 01:15:57.197]  Not because I'm scared of him.
[01:15:57.197 --> 01:15:58.299]  I don't want to go down the road.
[01:15:59.591 --> 01:16:07.175]  Of some of these people that are trying to shut down our YouTube channel and some of the folks, other folks that are threatening us and things.
[01:16:07.175 --> 01:16:13.498]  I know Wolfgang's been through a lot of this with police coming to his house in another state for the feds and threatening him.
[01:16:13.498 --> 01:16:18.000]  That's why he's intensified what he's doing, but they do not want us looking into this.
[01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:23.483]  And so, you know, he's a guy from the system, but it just doesn't add up.
[01:16:23.483 --> 01:16:25.344]  Mr. Halbig, thanks for coming on.
[01:16:25.344 --> 01:16:26.425]  Recap who you are.
[01:16:27.688 --> 01:16:36.036]  Recap why you question kind of the top 10 or 15 points, that I know are on your website, of why this doesn't add up.
[01:16:36.036 --> 01:16:44.004]  And then now they're really trying to seal everything when they could discredit us any time they wanted to.
[01:16:44.004 --> 01:16:48.288]  Just tell us why Anderson Cooper's nose disappears, why it's a blue screen.
[01:16:48.288 --> 01:16:52.532]  Just tell us why the people are walking in circles in and out of the building, it appears to be staged.
[01:16:52.972 --> 01:16:56.093]  Tell us why they said they didn't catch somebody in the woods when they did.
[01:16:56.093 --> 01:17:00.674]  Tell us why the school was closed before and then after, why they've sealed it all, why they've now torn it down.
[01:17:00.674 --> 01:17:07.516]  Tell us why Bloomberg emailed his people the day before saying, get ready to launch an operation to capitalize on a mass shooting.
[01:17:07.516 --> 01:17:09.837]  Tell us why you didn't launch the emergency helicopters.
[01:17:09.837 --> 01:17:15.859]  Tell us why the ambulance was parked for an hour down the road.
[01:17:15.859 --> 01:17:18.660]  Tell us why this appears to be as phony as a $3 bill.
[01:17:18.660 --> 01:17:19.660]  Wolfgang, thank you for joining us.
[01:17:20.339 --> 01:17:21.420]  Thanks a lot, Alex.
[01:17:21.420 --> 01:17:23.421]  And thank God you have a voice.
[01:17:23.421 --> 01:17:26.083]  I'm glad InfoWars is out there.
[01:17:26.083 --> 01:17:32.088]  And the people that are attacking you now, they are coming after me.
[01:17:32.088 --> 01:17:34.530]  I mean, they're just coming after me.
[01:17:34.530 --> 01:17:36.191]  I mean, they're destroying my family.
[01:17:36.191 --> 01:17:37.692]  They've destroyed my business.
[01:17:37.692 --> 01:17:38.733]  And I'm passionate.
[01:17:38.733 --> 01:17:47.899]  And the only reason that I really got involved in this, I'm standing in front of 200 Florida school board members in Tampa, Florida.
[01:17:47.899 --> 01:17:48.420]  And Alex,
[01:17:49.192 --> 01:17:53.576]  They are worried that they may have a Sandy Hook unfolding in their community.
[01:17:53.576 --> 01:17:56.279]  So they're asking me questions for two hours.
[01:17:56.279 --> 01:17:58.641]  I can't give them the solutions.
[01:17:58.641 --> 01:18:05.688]  Because number one, there's not one of us in America that knows the truth as to what actually happened in Sandy Hook.
[01:18:05.688 --> 01:18:07.089]  So what do I do?
[01:18:07.089 --> 01:18:11.634]  I simply ask questions as a National School Safety Consultant.
[01:18:12.196 --> 01:18:22.203]  They are so simple that anyone should be able to answer that from the school board, from the city, Newtown Police, Connecticut State Police.
[01:18:22.203 --> 01:18:26.346]  Two years and they're refusing to answer my questions.
[01:18:29.957 --> 01:18:34.484]  We're getting copyright claims filed on us for just showing news articles and you can't do that.
[01:18:34.484 --> 01:18:41.394]  We've defeated these copyright claims, but there's been a lot of other stuff behind the scenes going on by other organizations and groups.
[01:18:41.394 --> 01:18:44.338]  They're really upset about this.
[01:18:44.338 --> 01:18:45.260]  Well, you know what?
[01:18:46.869 --> 01:18:48.150]  They need to get ready, Alex.
[01:18:48.150 --> 01:18:49.191]  We're coming.
[01:18:49.191 --> 01:18:55.595]  If you could be in my office right now today, beyond a reasonable doubt, we have all the evidence.
[01:18:55.595 --> 01:18:59.318]  People anonymously have now come forward from Newtown.
[01:18:59.318 --> 01:19:00.999]  We now have documents.
[01:19:01.653 --> 01:19:06.398]  That will, without a doubt, show that that school did not exist.
[01:19:06.398 --> 01:19:08.160]  It was not an operation.
[01:19:08.160 --> 01:19:12.865]  Well, you better release those as soon as possible or they're going to end up... I mean, you know what happens to people.
[01:19:12.865 --> 01:19:15.028]  They're going to claim you suicided yourself.
[01:19:15.028 --> 01:19:17.651]  They'll probably take some of your family out, claim you killed them to demonize you.
[01:19:17.651 --> 01:19:18.432]  That's how they do it now.
[01:19:18.432 --> 01:19:19.433]  They kill you and your family.
[01:19:20.031 --> 01:19:22.292]  Well, Alex, I saw my doctor the other day.
[01:19:22.292 --> 01:19:23.592]  I am not suicidal.
[01:19:23.592 --> 01:19:26.253]  I told my doctor I'm about as happy as can be.
[01:19:26.253 --> 01:19:28.694]  I got three great grandkids.
[01:19:28.694 --> 01:19:34.056]  But I'm telling you, the evidence that we have, and right now I have an attorney here in Orlando.
[01:19:34.056 --> 01:19:35.616]  We filed a lawsuit.
[01:19:35.616 --> 01:19:39.338]  The judge here in Orlando allowed us to move forward.
[01:19:39.338 --> 01:19:45.640]  She granted me 10 subpoenas that we issued two weeks ago for discovery information.
[01:19:45.640 --> 01:19:45.980]  Alex,
[01:19:46.420 --> 01:19:48.143]  We are on the move.
[01:19:48.143 --> 01:19:48.444]  I know.
[01:19:48.444 --> 01:19:49.245]  You're on the march.
[01:19:49.245 --> 01:19:50.727]  The Empire Alive is on the run.
[01:19:50.727 --> 01:19:52.631]  Wolfgang W. Halbig.
[01:19:52.631 --> 01:19:53.232]  Stay there.
[01:19:53.232 --> 01:19:55.255]  They threatened him, so he's going in hard.
[01:19:55.255 --> 01:19:55.656]  We'll be back.
[01:19:59.574 --> 01:20:06.316]  Usually, the older one gets, the less you are able to absorb amino acids and the less you are able to repair the 100 trillion cells of your body.
[01:20:06.316 --> 01:20:10.697]  As a result, you'll have less energy, your tissues will shrink, and you'll become wrinkled.
[01:20:10.697 --> 01:20:14.199]  An older person will typically injure more easily and heal more slowly.
[01:20:14.199 --> 01:20:15.339]  Not fun!
[01:20:15.339 --> 01:20:23.721]  However, if you can consume a protein powder that is easier to absorb, then you may be able to gain back some strength, muscle, and speed of recovery.
[01:20:23.721 --> 01:20:28.503]  One World Whey is a highly digestible whey protein powder that may be the perfect answer for you.
[01:20:28.823 --> 01:20:29.984]  My name is Errol.
[01:20:29.984 --> 01:20:31.525]  I'm 74 years old.
[01:20:31.525 --> 01:20:34.107]  You know, the taste of One World Whey is amazing.
[01:20:34.107 --> 01:20:41.952]  I play pickleball, and since taking One World Whey and your Trace Mineral Supplement, I have more energy and recover faster from my working out.
[01:20:41.952 --> 01:20:48.256]  I used to take another grass-fed whey protein powder, but now I'm getting much better results using One World Whey.
[01:20:48.256 --> 01:20:48.556]  Call 888-988-3325.
[01:20:48.556 --> 01:20:48.937]  That's 888-988-3325.
[01:20:48.937 --> 01:20:50.017]  Or visit OneWorldWhey.com.
[01:20:58.723 --> 01:21:01.564]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[01:21:01.564 --> 01:21:06.687]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[01:21:06.687 --> 01:21:14.811]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the Charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[01:21:14.811 --> 01:21:19.333]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[01:21:19.333 --> 01:21:23.315]  MyPatriotSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[01:21:23.315 --> 01:21:25.716]  They now operate two distribution facilities.
[01:21:26.016 --> 01:21:29.238]  And employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[01:21:29.238 --> 01:21:32.400]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[01:21:32.400 --> 01:21:37.784]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality storable foods from My Patriot Supply.
[01:21:37.784 --> 01:21:45.969]  Go to MyPatriotSupply.com forward slash Alex today for special offers on emergency food storage or call their preparedness specialist at 866-229-0927.
[01:21:45.969 --> 01:21:46.269]  That's 866-229-0927.

[01:21:55.115 --> 01:22:01.141]  What good is a Big Berkey Water Filter?
[01:22:01.141 --> 01:22:04.704]  We get that question a lot here at BigBerkeyWaterFilters.com.
[01:22:04.704 --> 01:22:06.846]  And in a word, the answer is protection.
[01:22:06.846 --> 01:22:15.835]  Protection from water main breaks, E. coli contamination, environmental chemical spills, pesticide runoff, chlorine taste and smell, and all forms of fluoride.
[01:22:16.135 --> 01:22:22.141]  Plus, Big Berkey water filters are the original gravity water filter system and most trusted on the market for a reason.

[01:22:28.508 --> 01:22:33.332]  At only 1.7 cents a gallon, a single set of filters can last for 5 to 10 years.
[01:22:33.332 --> 01:22:34.794]  That means big savings!
[01:22:35.094 --> 01:22:39.555]  Big Berkey, the one that's powerful enough to purify stagnant pond water.
[01:22:39.555 --> 01:22:42.757]  Get a Big Berkey today at BigBerkeyWaterFilters.com.

[01:22:58.013 --> 01:22:59.934]  It's very easy to be a criminal.
[01:22:59.934 --> 01:23:03.576]  All you need to burglarize a home is one simple household tool.
[01:23:03.576 --> 01:23:04.917]  A pair of scissors.
[01:23:04.917 --> 01:23:10.720]  If your home security system can be compromised by a criminal using scissors, then you're making it easy for them.
[01:23:10.720 --> 01:23:15.643]  Almost every home security system, even those sold by big-name companies, has a weakness.
[01:23:15.643 --> 01:23:16.623]  The phone line.
[01:23:16.623 --> 01:23:21.886]  You shell out $1,500, get locked into a long-term contract, and think you're safe.
[01:23:21.886 --> 01:23:25.628]  But a burglar can destroy your alarm in seconds with one snip.
[01:23:25.768 --> 01:23:29.092]  And when a burglar cuts your phone line, you're defenseless.
[01:23:29.092 --> 01:23:31.556]  SimpliSafe Home Security is the smarter choice.
[01:23:31.556 --> 01:23:35.921]  Built by Harvard engineers, SimpliSafe uses a wireless connection to call the cops.
[01:23:35.921 --> 01:23:37.003]  Scissors can't cut it.
[01:23:37.003 --> 01:23:39.466]  And that means your home stays safe.
[01:23:39.466 --> 01:23:43.051]  24-7 professional monitoring is under $15 a month with no contract.
[01:23:43.251 --> 01:23:46.753]  SimpliSafe home security keeps you safer than the other guys.

[01:23:49.935 --> 01:23:50.755]  SimpliSafe.

[01:24:09.682 --> 01:24:17.446]  Speaking of demonization, speaking of brainwashing, and clearly Sandy Hook was used as a propaganda event.
[01:24:17.446 --> 01:24:19.486]  Don't let a good crisis go to waste.
[01:24:19.486 --> 01:24:26.450]  As the White House Chief of Staff said, Rahm Emanuel, to demonize gun owners and say, how dare you?
[01:24:26.450 --> 01:24:28.551]  You killed these children.
[01:24:28.551 --> 01:24:33.113]  When somebody uses a baseball bat or a knife to kill people, you don't blame Louisville Sluggers.
[01:24:34.665 --> 01:24:36.447]  Blame ginsu knives.
[01:24:36.447 --> 01:24:39.550]  When somebody runs over somebody with a Ford truck, you don't blame Ford.
[01:24:39.550 --> 01:24:41.372]  You blame who wields it.
[01:24:41.372 --> 01:24:43.634]  Look at this article on Infowars.com.
[01:24:43.634 --> 01:24:47.658]  Six-year-old child suspended for making gun shape with hand.
[01:24:47.658 --> 01:24:50.360]  Child forced to undergo re-education.
[01:24:50.360 --> 01:24:51.021]  I'm not kidding.
[01:24:51.021 --> 01:24:52.743]  On what it means to be dead.
[01:24:54.537 --> 01:24:58.218]  Death education has been linked to massive increases in suicide.
[01:24:58.218 --> 01:25:05.060]  I want to add to this excellent article by Steve Watson, the image of Obama two weeks ago doing a selfie, aiming his hand as a gun.
[01:25:05.060 --> 01:25:08.801]  I think the President should resign over that.
[01:25:08.801 --> 01:25:13.682]  And we need to add a quote from Holder to the article, as a listener's done in the comments section.
[01:25:13.682 --> 01:25:22.604]  What we need to do is change the way in which people think about guns, especially young people, and really brainwash people into thinking about guns in a very different way.
[01:25:24.082 --> 01:25:25.083]  Frank makes that point.
[01:25:25.083 --> 01:25:28.084]  Yeah, this is brainwashing.
[01:25:28.084 --> 01:25:32.847]  Oh, you can't, in your school paper in Minnesota, criticize radical jihadists.
[01:25:32.847 --> 01:25:35.669]  Oh, you can't say brown bag in Seattle, you're racist.
[01:25:35.669 --> 01:25:38.351]  Oh, you can't say bang bang cops and robbers.
[01:25:38.351 --> 01:25:39.832]  This is sick!
[01:25:39.832 --> 01:25:43.454]  But oh, the kid can go home and play Xbox, a shoot-em-up game all day.
[01:25:43.454 --> 01:25:45.295]  It's all about the individual getting in trouble.
[01:25:46.988 --> 01:25:48.272]  Talk about a cult.
[01:25:48.272 --> 01:25:49.876]  Wolfgang Halbig, you've got the floor.
[01:25:49.876 --> 01:25:52.263]  It's a short segment, long segment coming up.
[01:25:52.263 --> 01:25:54.148]  Bombshell info you're breaking today.
[01:25:55.498 --> 01:26:02.581]  Bombshell info, go over the main points of Sandy Hook as a cop safety expert while you questioned it.
[01:26:02.581 --> 01:26:09.523]  There you are, successful, making a lot of money, running nationwide programs, playing golf, you know, pretty much quasi-retired.
[01:26:09.523 --> 01:26:11.364]  Why would you do all this?
[01:26:11.364 --> 01:26:12.944]  Well, because it didn't add up.
[01:26:12.944 --> 01:26:17.646]  I know you've talked about that on air, I'm not putting words in your mouth, but then the latest bombshell you just dropped
[01:26:18.612 --> 01:26:29.141]  You're saying, because we know the school suddenly reopened, had been closed, and then they tore it down, the place was falling apart in photos and videos we saw, didn't look like a real school.
[01:26:29.141 --> 01:26:32.564]  Then you add everything together, it looks like a prop, a drill.
[01:26:32.564 --> 01:26:33.725]  Did they kill real kids?
[01:26:33.725 --> 01:26:35.066]  Maybe, maybe not.
[01:26:35.066 --> 01:26:36.367]  Why didn't they call helicopters?
[01:26:36.367 --> 01:26:38.869]  I mean, I keep repeating this, it just doesn't add up.
[01:26:38.869 --> 01:26:41.091]  Wolfgang, what's the new bombshell info?
[01:26:41.903 --> 01:26:47.487]  Well, the new bombshell is that the subpoenas have been issued across the country.
[01:26:47.487 --> 01:26:51.710]  We're about to get discovery information that is now forthcoming.
[01:26:51.710 --> 01:26:57.014]  And if they don't provide that discovery information, they're going to be in contempt of court.
[01:26:57.014 --> 01:27:02.878]  And we also have the Connecticut Freedom of Information Commission hearing that is supposed to have already happened.
[01:27:03.271 --> 01:27:05.635]  They keep dragging it and dragging it.
[01:27:05.635 --> 01:27:08.059]  But eventually, we're going to get the truth.
[01:27:08.059 --> 01:27:09.902]  And the truth is going to show.
[01:27:09.902 --> 01:27:13.789]  Sandy Hook, that school, was not an operating school.
[01:27:13.789 --> 01:27:17.315]  And I can tell you that from being a school administrator, Alex.
[01:27:17.842 --> 01:27:21.824]  It is the most filthiest, the most deplorable school.
[01:27:21.824 --> 01:27:26.965]  No child should have ever, or any teacher should have ever died in such a filthy school.
[01:27:26.965 --> 01:27:28.726]  It is loaded with lead paint.
[01:27:28.726 --> 01:27:30.747]  It is loaded with asbestos.
[01:27:30.747 --> 01:27:32.708]  It's loaded with PCP.
[01:27:32.708 --> 01:27:41.451]  And those parents who called it a vanguard school, who moved from all over the country, how could you send your kid to that filthy school, Alex?
[01:27:41.451 --> 01:27:43.832]  You and I wouldn't send our children to that school.
[01:27:45.717 --> 01:27:50.741]  Before we get into the judge, your filing, where all this is going, it hasn't gotten a lot of national attention.
[01:27:50.741 --> 01:27:53.182]  It's gotten some, though, in the next segment.
[01:27:53.182 --> 01:27:56.785]  Recap what made you first start asking questions.
[01:27:56.785 --> 01:28:01.988]  Well, what made me start asking questions is being a National School A's safety expert.
[01:28:01.988 --> 01:28:03.569]  It took me three days.
[01:28:03.569 --> 01:28:08.333]  Alex, when you don't request trauma helicopters, that's negligent.
[01:28:08.333 --> 01:28:09.774]  Whether they land or not,
[01:28:10.774 --> 01:28:12.535]  Okay, that's the way.
[01:28:12.535 --> 01:28:23.899]  But they should have at least been requested to not allow paramedics and EMTs inside that school all day long when children's lives could have been saved.
[01:28:23.899 --> 01:28:25.699]  That's negligence.
[01:28:25.699 --> 01:28:29.501]  So they were turning off the default training of any police agency?
[01:28:30.754 --> 01:28:32.015]  Absolutely.
[01:28:32.015 --> 01:28:34.936]  Columbine taught us one thing across America.
[01:28:34.936 --> 01:28:40.678]  The government spends hundreds of millions of dollars and they use the word active shooter training.
[01:28:40.678 --> 01:28:53.584]  Well, active shooter training, Alex, is to get in that school as quickly as possible, neutralize the threat, and then you get all the medical help that you can find and you get in there to save lives.
[01:28:53.584 --> 01:28:57.546]  Alex, they never transported those kids, any kids, for over an hour.
[01:28:57.546 --> 01:28:57.906]  I know.
[01:29:00.219 --> 01:29:04.581]  They had them bivouac and gather down the street a half mile away.
[01:29:04.581 --> 01:29:06.001]  Very bizarre.
[01:29:06.001 --> 01:29:12.524]  And Alex, who declared all of those children and teachers legally dead in the first ten minutes?
[01:29:12.524 --> 01:29:17.786]  When only a doctor or a licensed registered nurse, specially certified, can do that.
[01:29:17.786 --> 01:29:22.188]  It's gotta be a specially certified nurse or coroner, and that's usually long after they're dead.
[01:29:22.188 --> 01:29:24.508]  They come out and put a tag on their toe.
[01:29:24.508 --> 01:29:26.969]  Absolutely, and the coroner didn't show up for four hours.
[01:29:26.969 --> 01:29:27.830]  So again, Alex,
[01:29:28.630 --> 01:29:32.032]  Who declared them legally dead?
[01:29:32.032 --> 01:29:36.714]  Why was every standard procedure ignored and why are they covering up now?
[01:29:36.714 --> 01:29:37.594]  And you know what?
[01:29:37.594 --> 01:29:40.175]  And we need to hold these people accountable.
[01:29:40.175 --> 01:29:44.177]  All of your listeners, the people who love you, Alex, call.
[01:29:44.177 --> 01:29:45.358]  Call your congressman.
[01:29:45.358 --> 01:29:46.658]  Call your senator.
[01:29:46.658 --> 01:29:48.959]  These people owe us an explanation.
[01:29:48.959 --> 01:29:49.620]  Wolfgang, stay there.
[01:29:49.620 --> 01:29:53.221]  We're going to come back and break it all down and why they're desperate to shut us up.
[01:29:58.948 --> 01:30:07.936]  Sold out for weeks due to the difficult and extensive proprietary process behind its creation, the exclusive InfoWars Life Secret 12 formulation is now back in stock.
[01:30:07.936 --> 01:30:18.465]  This ultra-clean vitamin B12 nutraceutical has been carefully crafted and developed over the last two years and is based on cellular science of how your body actively absorbs essential nutrients.
[01:30:18.465 --> 01:30:24.530]  Most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic and could not be properly absorbed by the body.
[01:30:24.890 --> 01:30:31.294]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimedical-grade, bioavailable coenzyme forms of B12.
[01:30:31.294 --> 01:30:39.900]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections, and adenosylcobalamin, the most bioactive form that has been created with our proprietary process.
[01:30:39.900 --> 01:30:42.962]  Secret 12 is taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.
[01:30:42.962 --> 01:30:44.503]  No needles, no injections.
[01:30:44.503 --> 01:30:45.904]  Don't take my word for it.
[01:30:45.904 --> 01:30:47.105]  Try it for yourself.
[01:30:47.105 --> 01:30:48.426]  Discover the secret.
[01:30:48.426 --> 01:30:49.527]  Secret 12.
[01:30:49.527 --> 01:30:51.848]  Supplies of Secret 12 are very limited.

[01:31:53.434 --> 01:31:53.774]  Silver Bullet.
[01:31:58.874 --> 01:32:02.537]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[01:32:02.537 --> 01:32:06.820]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[01:32:06.820 --> 01:32:08.601]  Can you put two and two together?
[01:32:08.601 --> 01:32:13.945]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds.
[01:32:13.945 --> 01:32:16.467]  It's reasonably priced and fully legal.
[01:32:16.467 --> 01:32:17.608]  But for how long?

[01:32:24.253 --> 01:32:26.114]  Infidel Body Armor.
[01:32:26.114 --> 01:32:27.075]  Just won't quit.
[01:32:28.462 --> 01:32:31.983]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[01:32:31.983 --> 01:32:40.227]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[01:32:40.227 --> 01:32:45.629]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.

[01:33:08.502 --> 01:33:12.523]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[01:33:12.523 --> 01:33:16.604]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:16.604 --> 01:33:20.965]  I know of more than 20 declassified, admitted cases where the U.S.
[01:33:20.965 --> 01:33:31.548]  government, in the last 120 years or so, has staged bombings, attacks, mass shootings, and blamed it on political enemies.
[01:33:31.548 --> 01:33:37.009]  I don't know exactly what happened at the Boston bombing, but I know the older Tsarnaev brother, who they hunted down and killed,
[01:33:38.962 --> 01:33:53.867]  ...was in a CIA-funded program out of Georgetown infiltrating Al-Qaeda groups in Chechnya, and two years before the Boston bombing, the Russians blew his cover.
[01:33:53.867 --> 01:33:57.408]  The FBI lied and said they never heard of him when the Boston bombing happened.
[01:33:57.408 --> 01:34:07.672]  They now chased down the other brother, and of course tried to kill him, but that failed, so now Stars and Stripes says Czarnev's lawyer admits he carried out Boston bombing.
[01:34:09.329 --> 01:34:11.930]  Wow, so now the lawyer comes out and says, oh, he did it.
[01:34:11.930 --> 01:34:12.971]  It was him.
[01:34:12.971 --> 01:34:16.493]  Judy Clark says, well, lawyers like that.
[01:34:16.493 --> 01:34:17.753]  Isn't that nice?
[01:34:17.753 --> 01:34:19.634]  He pleads not guilty, but she says it was him.
[01:34:19.634 --> 01:34:22.295]  Well, I know one thing.
[01:34:22.295 --> 01:34:24.577]  None of that story added up.
[01:34:24.577 --> 01:34:29.299]  I'm not going to go back into it, but I've seen this over and over again.
[01:34:33.120 --> 01:34:36.722]  False flags don't just happen at the start of The Running Man and fiction movies.
[01:34:36.722 --> 01:34:41.344]  They are the bread and butter of totalitarian elements within governments.
[01:34:41.344 --> 01:34:46.827]  And who can deny we're going in a totalitarian direction that ends up hurting all Americans, except a tiny group.
[01:34:46.827 --> 01:34:48.648]  And it hurts them as well in the end.
[01:34:48.648 --> 01:34:49.689]  But they are of their...
[01:34:51.357 --> 01:34:52.517]  They're feathered.
[01:34:52.517 --> 01:34:54.238]  Birds of a feather flock together.
[01:34:54.238 --> 01:34:56.038]  Of their father, the devil, I guess you could say.
[01:34:56.038 --> 01:35:03.240]  Before I go back to Wolfgang W. Halbig, I want to open the phones up specifically for your questions or comments.
[01:35:03.240 --> 01:35:10.782]  We don't have time for diatribes or not a bunch of name-calling against people that say Sandy Hook happened or people that say it didn't.
[01:35:10.782 --> 01:35:11.803]  Serious questions.
[01:35:11.803 --> 01:35:13.063]  I'd love to hear from you.
[01:35:13.063 --> 01:35:16.064]  I'm not admonishing the general audience, but, you know, some of the trolls out there
[01:35:16.684 --> 01:35:22.545]  I don't want to attack some of the supposed parents of the victims, because that opens some dangerous doors.
[01:35:22.545 --> 01:35:25.866]  I don't want to attack Halbig.
[01:35:25.866 --> 01:35:27.526]  You can bring up any questions or comments.
[01:35:27.526 --> 01:35:30.207]  You can disagree with him or agree with him or add points.
[01:35:30.207 --> 01:35:31.227]  Here's the toll-free number.
[01:35:31.227 --> 01:35:31.607]  800-259-9231.
[01:35:31.607 --> 01:35:31.667]  800-259-9231.
[01:35:31.667 --> 01:35:35.328]  If we've seen false flags over and over again, and then you've got all these anomalies,
[01:35:44.184 --> 01:35:48.125]  And clear Luke tapes and clear blue screen, green screens.
[01:35:48.125 --> 01:35:50.166]  I mean, they really screwed up.
[01:35:50.166 --> 01:35:53.827]  CNN screwed up during the Gulf War with fake green screen stuff.
[01:35:53.827 --> 01:35:56.347]  Blue screen in that case.
[01:35:56.347 --> 01:35:59.068]  Chroma key.
[01:35:59.068 --> 01:36:00.488]  You could have pink screen if you wanted to.
[01:36:00.488 --> 01:36:02.369]  It's just the colors seem to be blue and mint green.
[01:36:02.369 --> 01:36:05.870]  And you know, fake scud attacks that are admitted.
[01:36:07.378 --> 01:36:14.965]  I just, it had all the signs to how they were so ready that day, how they capitalized on, how they rolled out all these groups.
[01:36:14.965 --> 01:36:17.867]  You look at the Aurora shooting.
[01:36:17.867 --> 01:36:19.268]  They're real shooters.
[01:36:19.268 --> 01:36:20.930]  They're real people that go in and shoot folks up.
[01:36:20.930 --> 01:36:22.351]  They're crazy people.
[01:36:22.351 --> 01:36:28.316]  It's happened before, but he was under, on record,
[01:36:32.881 --> 01:36:41.383]  The Aurora shooter under the top psychiatrist who'd headed up the psychiatric department for the entire Air Force command of over seven bases.
[01:36:42.589 --> 01:36:44.291]  Uh, in San Antonio.
[01:36:44.291 --> 01:36:45.372]  She's sent there.
[01:36:45.372 --> 01:36:49.115]  He's in a secret government brain DARPA human interface program.
[01:36:49.115 --> 01:36:52.057]  His dad's a top scientist in secret operations.
[01:36:52.057 --> 01:37:00.945]  He's given hundreds of thousands of dollars by the government in secret projects, and then he's drugged in the parking lot saying he didn't do it, and tells people in jail, I'm drugged, I didn't do it.
[01:37:00.945 --> 01:37:06.730]  Then they come out and say, oh, he wasn't with people, uh, at the jail where they could hear him, and it turned out he was.
[01:37:09.269 --> 01:37:11.890]  So, I mean, I've just seen this over and over again.
[01:37:11.890 --> 01:37:15.991]  Shooter James Holmes and DARPA, Weird Science is the article, by Curt Nemo.
[01:37:15.991 --> 01:37:24.274]  I mean, folks, they could grab me for six weeks, drug me up, dump me out in the parking lot after they carry out a shooting, and I would think that I'd done the shooting.
[01:37:24.274 --> 01:37:25.974]  They could do it to you.
[01:37:25.974 --> 01:37:28.715]  I mean, you could put somebody on PCP-LSD.
[01:37:28.715 --> 01:37:30.216]  That's just what they did in the 60s and 70s.
[01:37:30.216 --> 01:37:34.737]  They got stuff now, amnesiacs they can give you.
[01:37:34.737 --> 01:37:37.618]  It is beyond the Manchurian candidate.
[01:37:40.477 --> 01:37:49.102]  In fact, 25 years ago, and I'm gonna go back to our guest, they had RoboRat, brain chips in rats, where they could send them into rubble after earthquakes and things.
[01:37:49.102 --> 01:37:53.085]  Then they had RoboDog, but people said it was inhumane.
[01:37:53.085 --> 01:37:57.428]  So they keep all that stuff on the LD, on the low down.
[01:37:57.428 --> 01:38:00.410]  Not on the down low, it's low down.
[01:38:00.410 --> 01:38:05.354]  So they keep it on the LDDL, but it's a huge program going on.
[01:38:05.354 --> 01:38:08.596]  So they've got chips where you're just like a remote control.
[01:38:09.926 --> 01:38:13.147]  You're just like a remote control.
[01:38:13.147 --> 01:38:17.889]  And you could even be thinking, I don't want to do this, but your arms, your legs, and I'm not saying they've done that.
[01:38:17.889 --> 01:38:23.852]  I'm just saying that's how far out the technology is.
[01:38:23.852 --> 01:38:25.973]  That's, that's how advanced all this is.
[01:38:25.973 --> 01:38:28.594]  And I'm not saying that happened at Sandy Hook.
[01:38:30.638 --> 01:38:33.419]  I'm saying it was a drill, a giant piece of theater.
[01:38:33.419 --> 01:38:34.820]  Did they really kill some kids?
[01:38:34.820 --> 01:38:37.721]  I don't know, but the school appears to have never been opened.
[01:38:37.721 --> 01:38:41.283]  We'll talk to Wolfgang Halbig and take your calls here in a moment.
[01:38:41.283 --> 01:38:44.384]  TheSandyHookJustice.com.
[01:38:44.384 --> 01:38:48.706]  Now, before we go any further, speaking of supporting this platform, pray for us, please.
[01:38:48.706 --> 01:38:49.927]  We need your prayers.
[01:38:49.927 --> 01:38:52.268]  It's not that we just believe in them, we depend on them.
[01:38:52.268 --> 01:38:55.910]  My aunt has that little sign
[01:38:56.966 --> 01:38:58.647]  On our wall, by the kitchen.
[01:38:58.647 --> 01:39:03.731]  We don't believe in prayer, we depend on it.
[01:39:03.731 --> 01:39:07.233]  Spread the word about InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:39:07.233 --> 01:39:13.857]  Put links at the end of your emails, your Facebook, your Twitter postings saying, hey, here's the free link to listen or watch the Alex Jones Show.
[01:39:13.857 --> 01:39:16.699]  Here's a local Amorephim affiliate he's on.
[01:39:16.699 --> 01:39:20.742]  Realize that giving that gift of pointing people in the right direction is life-changing.
[01:39:20.742 --> 01:39:23.984]  Most new listeners we run into heard about it from friends and family.
[01:39:25.399 --> 01:39:31.701]  Or they see me on Discovery Channel or History Channel in a documentary or in Waking Life or another film and they think, who is that guy?
[01:39:31.701 --> 01:39:33.082]  I'm going to search engine him.
[01:39:33.082 --> 01:39:35.583]  They search engine me and they find the show.
[01:39:35.583 --> 01:39:40.925]  But Google's moving to, quote, delist alternative media right now to try to shut us down.
[01:39:40.925 --> 01:39:42.425]  And not just us, but you as well.
[01:39:42.425 --> 01:39:46.247]  So before they move into the next phase, we've got to really work hard.
[01:39:46.247 --> 01:39:49.628]  They're trying to shut us down, even though it exposes them as tyrants.
[01:39:49.628 --> 01:39:53.630]  It's very risky because we're so effective.
[01:39:53.630 --> 01:39:54.230]  And finally,
[01:39:55.487 --> 01:39:56.708]  Shop with the good guys.

[01:41:18.960 --> 01:41:23.443]  888-253-3139.
[01:41:23.443 --> 01:41:28.426]  Now, Wolfgang, I want to go to calls, but I've been asking some of the questions here.
[01:41:28.426 --> 01:41:32.069]  I want to give you the floor to talk about other facets.
[01:41:32.069 --> 01:41:33.070]  But before we do that,
[01:41:34.056 --> 01:41:51.068]  Can you tell us about the court case, who the judge was, or is that sealed, where this is going, what you're subpoenaing, what you're looking into, and you're saying the new bombshell evidence you have that the school wasn't operating when this happened, as it appears on the surface to not have been operating.
[01:41:51.837 --> 01:42:01.980]  Well, I know it's not operating because the school board is refusing to answer all of the questions we've asked under the Connecticut FOIA information.
[01:42:01.980 --> 01:42:07.962]  These are school board policies that require the school board to inspect
[01:42:08.582 --> 01:42:24.670]  Every school in Newtown, and they have to be completed by August 1st of each year, that inspection report on health and safety and cleanliness, inside, outside, has to be submitted to the superintendent who provides it to the school board.
[01:42:24.670 --> 01:42:26.130]  Guess what they tell me?
[01:42:26.130 --> 01:42:27.931]  We have no such records.
[01:42:27.931 --> 01:42:31.953]  You cannot tell me as a former school administrator that you don't have any records.
[01:42:32.273 --> 01:42:37.026]  When you have a school board policy that requires it, that's what I'm telling you.
[01:42:37.026 --> 01:42:38.490]  They are covering up.
[01:42:38.490 --> 01:42:40.776]  Sandy Hook did not operate.
[01:42:43.203 --> 01:42:54.052]  Well, when you look at not calling the emergency choppers that we know operate in that town, you look that up, they have the emergency flight, the Star Flight, the Care Flight, and they just didn't call.
[01:42:54.052 --> 01:42:55.513]  Well, that's the default thing you do.
[01:42:55.513 --> 01:42:57.234]  There's a bunch of kids shot and people.
[01:42:57.234 --> 01:42:58.735]  You call the emergency helicopters.
[01:42:58.735 --> 01:43:01.658]  I mean, they call those when the cops see a bad car wreck.
[01:43:01.658 --> 01:43:02.678]  It's the default position.
[01:43:03.519 --> 01:43:05.940]  Absolutely, but you know what really bothers me more than that?
[01:43:05.940 --> 01:43:20.363]  They didn't pick up the phone to call the trauma helicopters, but somebody at the Incident Command Center picked up the yellow pages and called for 12 porta-potties to be delivered within the first three hours of this mass, casualty shooting.
[01:43:20.363 --> 01:43:29.685]  Alex, who is sitting here thinking about porta-potties when they can't even get the trauma helicopters or the paramedics and EMTs inside that school?
[01:43:29.685 --> 01:43:31.426]  That's outright negligence.
[01:43:32.168 --> 01:43:43.473]  Well, they're obviously looking for a big PR bonanza, and then to bring in all the actors to break down and cry, and they think we're so stupid they even use the same actors as different people.
[01:43:43.473 --> 01:43:57.880]  I mean, all I know is we've all seen the footage, and maybe they're real parents, whatever, but when you've got somebody laughing and smiling and going, watch this, and then walking over going, and then starting crying for the cameras, I mean, it's... What about the blue screen in Anderson Cooper's nose disappearing?
[01:43:58.797 --> 01:43:59.840]  Absolutely.
[01:43:59.840 --> 01:44:02.986]  The blue string, it's everywhere.
[01:44:02.986 --> 01:44:07.997]  Whether it's at the firehouse, whether it's Anderson Cooper, absolutely.
[01:44:07.997 --> 01:44:09.280]  They use that as a...
[01:44:10.657 --> 01:44:11.418]  Technology.
[01:44:11.418 --> 01:44:12.639]  It's like a movie set.
[01:44:12.639 --> 01:44:16.723]  They did whatever they wanted to, because guess what?
[01:44:16.723 --> 01:44:23.749]  They were using emotions, the death of children and teachers, unhooking everybody across America.
[01:44:23.749 --> 01:44:26.772]  They threw those funerals out there, and guess what?
[01:44:26.772 --> 01:44:28.133]  Everybody was watching it 24-7.
[01:44:29.915 --> 01:44:35.100]  They inflicted emotional distress on millions and millions of innocent Americans.
[01:44:35.100 --> 01:44:37.222]  Alex, they knew what they were doing.
[01:44:37.222 --> 01:44:38.643]  They got us hooked.
[01:44:38.643 --> 01:44:44.648]  In fact, can we pull up the clip of the Attorney General saying we literally brainwashed the public when he met with the media?
[01:44:44.648 --> 01:44:50.994]  Because clearly they certainly capitalized on it and were certainly ready, minute one, to do it.
[01:44:50.994 --> 01:44:56.019]  What about Bloomberg's internal email to his anti-gun groups, Wolfgang?
[01:44:56.699 --> 01:45:01.060]  Uh, saying, get ready, we're about to launch a major operation.
[01:45:01.060 --> 01:45:01.821]  Absolutely.
[01:45:01.821 --> 01:45:04.582]  I mean, this is so well planned.
[01:45:04.582 --> 01:45:08.523]  Two, two and a half years, millions of dollars invested.
[01:45:08.523 --> 01:45:20.787]  Think about it, you had to get the entire community involved, from the Catholic priests all the way down to your local, uh, government agents, your, uh, selectmen, your city council.
[01:45:20.787 --> 01:45:21.667]  These people,
[01:45:22.387 --> 01:45:22.927]  They're arrogant.
[01:45:22.927 --> 01:45:27.570]  Let me tell you, when I flew up there to Hartford, Connecticut, Newtown, they're so arrogant.
[01:45:27.570 --> 01:45:29.511]  I believe they all have immunity.
[01:45:29.511 --> 01:45:31.052]  I think they can do whatever they want.
[01:45:31.052 --> 01:45:40.256]  Well, listen, my dad's a dentist, and he was approached about four years ago by Homeland Security to go to these meetings and then spy on people.
[01:45:40.256 --> 01:45:41.997]  And my dad, the guy was real, gave him a card.
[01:45:41.997 --> 01:45:42.958]  My dad called, checked it.
[01:45:43.658 --> 01:45:43.878]  I think?
[01:46:01.431 --> 01:46:03.893]  And we want you to influence people, basically as an agent.
[01:46:03.893 --> 01:46:06.655]  And my dad thought they were setting him up, because he's my dad.
[01:46:06.655 --> 01:46:09.858]  No, they were ignorant, didn't even know who he was, basically.
[01:46:09.858 --> 01:46:11.560]  My dad then talked to all the other dentists.
[01:46:11.560 --> 01:46:13.461]  It was happening all over the city.
[01:46:13.461 --> 01:46:18.305]  Under InfraGard and these other spy programs, they tell people, you're going to be part of a drill.
[01:46:18.305 --> 01:46:19.726]  National security.
[01:46:19.726 --> 01:46:24.490]  And so, because there's an appeal of authority, and we're doing this for the children,
[01:46:25.424 --> 01:46:35.778]  They can then canvass and get people lined up and then once they're signed on to it, they're part of the conspiracy and have to keep quiet like the Manhattan Project or so many other programs.
[01:46:35.778 --> 01:46:42.667]  And so under this mantle of local spy grids, that's how they get people to go along with the cover-up.
[01:46:43.527 --> 01:46:49.452]  Well, they really did a good job at writing the scripts and getting people hooked.
[01:46:49.452 --> 01:47:00.562]  And the dash cam videos on that day, Alex, these police officers, Connecticut and Newtown, they actually had lunch inside the Sandy Hook Elementary School.
[01:47:01.182 --> 01:47:02.784]  Alex, you can see it!
[01:47:02.784 --> 01:47:12.115]  Now there are 20 dead bodies, you got adults, you got the shooter killed himself, and people are eating lunch inside the same... And they're ordering porta-potties.
[01:47:12.115 --> 01:47:17.101]  Anybody that knows, you see one dead kid, you don't eat for a day, you go home, you cry, you throw up.
[01:47:17.101 --> 01:47:19.564]  You don't go have lunch by their dead, splattered bodies.
[01:47:20.605 --> 01:47:28.132]  And if you look at the crime scene photos, there are more urinals and toilets inside that school than I've ever imagined.
[01:47:28.132 --> 01:47:29.853]  I mean, I haven't seen that many.
[01:47:29.853 --> 01:47:32.055]  Then why order porta-potties?
[01:47:32.055 --> 01:47:33.957]  You know, why have all the toilets?
[01:47:33.957 --> 01:47:35.819]  But they order porta-potties.
[01:47:35.819 --> 01:47:37.660]  Eat lunch inside the school.
[01:47:37.660 --> 01:47:40.703]  These people did a bad job writing the scripts.
[01:47:40.703 --> 01:47:44.066]  You don't screw with public schools unless you know how we operate.
[01:47:46.694 --> 01:47:48.276]  Again, you've run major universities.
[01:47:48.276 --> 01:47:50.038]  You've advised hundreds of public schools.
[01:47:50.038 --> 01:47:50.978]  I mean, I looked you up.
[01:47:50.978 --> 01:47:52.740]  You started going public last year.
[01:47:52.740 --> 01:47:57.505]  You were in the top two or three groups consulting nationwide.
[01:47:57.505 --> 01:47:59.727]  I mean, you were making a lot of money.
[01:47:59.727 --> 01:48:02.089]  You have no reason to be doing this, to be going public.
[01:48:02.089 --> 01:48:04.652]  I mean, I would imagine you've lost a lot of business.
[01:48:04.652 --> 01:48:05.973]  And you tell that to my wife.
[01:48:05.973 --> 01:48:09.116]  I am about to be kicked out of my own house after being married 39 years.
[01:48:10.524 --> 01:48:17.708]  Alex, I'm about to lose my family because I'm simply asking the questions that you and your stations are looking at.
[01:48:17.708 --> 01:48:22.611]  And I'm asking you right now, and I'm asking all your listeners, doggone it, support InfoWars.
[01:48:22.611 --> 01:48:24.372]  Become part of the Warriors.
[01:48:24.372 --> 01:48:25.193]  We need out.
[01:48:25.193 --> 01:48:26.033]  We need this show.
[01:48:26.033 --> 01:48:27.754]  We need the truth.
[01:48:27.754 --> 01:48:33.118]  If you find it in your heart to donate a few dollars to our legal funds, let me tell you, we have them.
[01:48:33.738 --> 01:48:35.341]  We have the lawsuits filed.
[01:48:35.341 --> 01:48:39.127]  We are closed, but we can't do it without people helping me.
[01:48:39.127 --> 01:48:41.912]  I'm too old for this, but I do need help.
[01:48:41.912 --> 01:48:44.616]  But big thing is, support InfoWars.
[01:48:44.616 --> 01:48:47.861]  Because if we don't have your voice, nobody's going to hear the truth.
[01:48:48.766 --> 01:48:55.635]  Well, folks, you need to donate, and briefly, because we're going to break, tell us the specifics of where it was filed, what's going on with the lawsuit.
[01:48:55.635 --> 01:49:04.907]  Well, it's filed here in Seminole County because all of my business, there's Children's Safety Institute, the National Institute, this is my home, this is where I live.
[01:49:05.507 --> 01:49:13.355]  And so instead of going to Connecticut where everything is crooked, we're going to come in the back door and therefore we file it.
[01:49:13.355 --> 01:49:15.617]  It's in the Seminole County court system.
[01:49:15.617 --> 01:49:25.646]  The judge, I mean the female judge, she saw what we're talking about and she did not hesitate issuing those 10 subpoenas across the country.
[01:49:25.646 --> 01:49:29.530]  And they've been served and we're not just waiting for all of the responses.
[01:49:29.833 --> 01:49:32.314]  Wow, well this is big national news.
[01:49:32.314 --> 01:49:34.714]  I want to jam in a phone call right now before we go to break.
[01:49:34.714 --> 01:49:37.095]  John in California, you're on the air.
[01:49:37.095 --> 01:49:39.496]  Thanks for calling.
[01:49:39.496 --> 01:49:43.597]  Hi, yeah, this is John from Fairfax, California.
[01:49:43.597 --> 01:49:47.218]  I was just wondering for you, Wolfgang, what group or specific
[01:49:47.970 --> 01:49:56.004]  Whether it's an individual or a government agency, police department has been digging in their heels most and giving you the most resistance.
[01:49:56.004 --> 01:50:01.214]  And also, all due respect to, if anything, anyone did lose their life in the Sandy Hook tragedy.
[01:50:04.369 --> 01:50:06.351]  I agree with you.
[01:50:06.351 --> 01:50:07.591]  I say this to you.
[01:50:07.591 --> 01:50:09.532]  I'm begging that I'm wrong.
[01:50:09.532 --> 01:50:21.259]  And if they answer my question to my satisfaction and to Alex's satisfaction, if they answer it to the people of America, to their satisfaction, I will run to the nearest mental health facility.
[01:50:21.259 --> 01:50:25.982]  And I've said it before, I'll voluntarily enroll myself because if I dare
[01:50:26.822 --> 01:50:30.724]  I need mental health.
[01:50:30.724 --> 01:50:34.026]  But I tell you what, I have spent my life doing this.
[01:50:34.026 --> 01:50:40.630]  And when people refuse to answer simple, logical questions, it raises the red flag.
[01:50:40.630 --> 01:50:43.872]  And I'm telling you, I'm not going to stop until we get the answers.
[01:50:44.852 --> 01:50:45.753]  We know it stinks.
[01:50:45.753 --> 01:50:46.633]  I mean, it's phony.
[01:50:46.633 --> 01:50:49.034]  The question is, what is going on?
[01:50:49.034 --> 01:50:50.114]  We don't know.
[01:50:50.114 --> 01:50:51.575]  We just know it's fake.
[01:50:51.575 --> 01:50:52.135]  How fake?
[01:50:52.135 --> 01:50:52.755]  We don't know.
[01:50:52.755 --> 01:50:53.896]  It's sick.
[01:50:53.896 --> 01:50:55.916]  Thank you, John.

[01:52:29.345 --> 01:52:31.506]  I had to stop and get my vitamins for the month.
[01:52:31.506 --> 01:52:34.808]  I got mine in the mail yesterday from DiscountNutritionShop.com.
[01:52:34.808 --> 01:52:37.089]  So I'm here totally on time.

[01:54:07.404 --> 01:54:08.745]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:54:08.745 --> 01:54:19.795]  Wolfgang Halbig, school expert, is our guest investigating, with great personal sacrifice, the Sandy Hook mystery.
[01:54:19.795 --> 01:54:21.236]  And believe me, it is a mystery.
[01:54:21.236 --> 01:54:22.757]  It doesn't add up.
[01:54:22.757 --> 01:54:24.919]  I wish it added up.
[01:54:24.919 --> 01:54:30.604]  I wish it would never have happened, but it's a lot less scary to have a lone crazy on Prozac type drugs out there.
[01:54:32.435 --> 01:54:35.577]  than it is to have it be a premeditated government operation.
[01:54:35.577 --> 01:54:44.483]  Kyle, Jay, Jimmy, Eric, Rick, we're going to go a little bit into the next hour with our guests to take your calls, and I'm going to shift gears into other open phones and a ton of news we haven't hit yet.
[01:54:44.483 --> 01:54:49.626]  But let's go to Kyle in Connecticut, speaking of the site of this sad tragedy.
[01:54:49.626 --> 01:54:52.488]  It's a tragedy any way you look at it.
[01:54:52.488 --> 01:54:54.829]  Kyle, thank you.
[01:54:54.829 --> 01:54:55.390]  Hi, Alex.
[01:54:55.390 --> 01:54:58.071]  Yeah, really good to be on the air with you.
[01:54:58.071 --> 01:55:00.713]  I actually run a demolition company here in Connecticut.
[01:55:01.537 --> 01:55:05.681]  I'm about an hour and a half away from the Newtown site.
[01:55:05.681 --> 01:55:12.346]  Someone approached me months ago about the demolition of a suspected shooter's house in Newtown.
[01:55:12.346 --> 01:55:16.069]  This is before it actually went to public vote, and this is way before this even happened.
[01:55:16.940 --> 01:55:25.204]  So, I was just wondering, like, between you and Wolfgang, what extent these people will go to to cover this up, to make it look like that, nothing at all.
[01:55:25.204 --> 01:55:26.785]  Yeah, why are they demolishing everything?
[01:55:26.785 --> 01:55:30.206]  Why are they passing laws to seal all the records?
[01:55:30.206 --> 01:55:32.067]  What's going on here, Wolfgang?
[01:55:32.067 --> 01:55:34.928]  Well, again, I'm glad Kyle, you asked that question.
[01:55:34.928 --> 01:55:37.910]  I mean, think about the San Diego Elementary School.
[01:55:38.900 --> 01:55:46.005]  It has to, you have to have a complete environmental study before you can demolish an elementary school.
[01:55:46.005 --> 01:55:57.013]  These people just violated every law, every regulation, and just like the house, you know, the house belongs actually supposedly to the brother of Adam Lanza if he really exists.
[01:55:57.543 --> 01:56:06.253]  I mean, there are so much misinformation, misdirection, and these people do whatever they want, and you know what they're saying to you and me?
[01:56:06.253 --> 01:56:07.715]  Well, you're stupid, America.
[01:56:07.715 --> 01:56:10.878]  You're too lazy to really investigate.
[01:56:10.878 --> 01:56:13.001]  And again, I go back to you.
[01:56:13.001 --> 01:56:14.983]  Thank you for calling and thanking Alex.
[01:56:14.983 --> 01:56:16.104]  Let me tell you what.
[01:56:16.104 --> 01:56:17.206]  People need to wake up.
[01:56:18.399 --> 01:56:21.300]  Sandy Hook is an American game changer.
[01:56:21.300 --> 01:56:28.702]  When we solve Sandy Hook, it's going to expose Boston bombing, it's going to expose 9-11, it's going to go down to JFK.
[01:56:28.702 --> 01:56:31.323]  This government is running amok.
[01:56:31.323 --> 01:56:34.844]  They are using us and using our emotions, and guess what?
[01:56:34.844 --> 01:56:38.306]  They're using the national news media, NBC, CBS.
[01:56:38.306 --> 01:56:39.486]  Sure, let me add this.
[01:56:39.486 --> 01:56:44.127]  In Operation Northwoods, it wasn't just fly planes into things and blame it on Cuba.
[01:56:44.127 --> 01:56:45.248]  And Kennedy said no to it.
[01:56:45.928 --> 01:56:52.937]  They were planning to do fake shootings and real shootings in public places as well, so he knows he's been on the board before.
[01:56:52.937 --> 01:56:55.620]  So it would be crazy not to ask the question.
[01:56:55.620 --> 01:56:56.441]  Thank you, Kyle.
[01:56:56.441 --> 01:56:58.824]  Jay in Pennsylvania, you're on the air with Wolfgang Halbig.
[01:57:02.443 --> 01:57:07.969]  I've been really hurting if you touch on it because there are like so many other perfectly good anomalies that Sandy Hook talked about.
[01:57:07.969 --> 01:57:08.690]  I just took off.
[01:57:08.690 --> 01:57:09.351]  I went off speaker.
[01:57:09.351 --> 01:57:10.092]  Is this better?
[01:57:21.001 --> 01:57:21.501]  All right, awesome.
[01:57:21.501 --> 01:57:36.369]  I was just wondering, I haven't heard any of you touch on it just because there are so many other anomalies, but does anyone remember the bus driver who said he like picked them up on the side of the road and claimed he brought them into his house for like 30 minutes and like just let the cops in and show up for like another hour?
[01:57:36.369 --> 01:57:43.953]  Like some student somehow ran out of the building and some... Well, this is all, yes, I've seen that interview, all sorts of bizarreness.
[01:57:43.953 --> 01:57:47.055]  What are some of the other bizarre anomalies for that particular one, Wolfgang?
[01:57:48.104 --> 01:58:02.147]  Oh, you've got Gene Rosen, you've got the bus driver, you've got... Can you imagine highly trained Connecticut SWAT team members can't find a nurse and a secretary inside that school for over four hours?
[01:58:02.147 --> 01:58:09.389]  Alex, this Connecticut State Police ought to be ashamed of themselves if that's the best that they can do.
[01:58:09.389 --> 01:58:10.529]  Well, that's ridiculous.
[01:58:10.529 --> 01:58:14.650]  A SWAT team in a school that size would find people in about 15 minutes.
[01:58:14.650 --> 01:58:16.170]  And the other thing, Alex, is that
[01:58:17.136 --> 01:58:18.177]  Picture the hole.
[01:58:18.177 --> 01:58:22.222]  Supposedly, Adam lands a shot out of the hole through the glass window.
[01:58:22.222 --> 01:58:30.673]  Alex, picture 18 highly trained Connecticut State Troopers all climbing through that shot out of the glass window, one behind another.
[01:58:31.656 --> 01:58:33.779]  The Three Stooges are smarter than that.
[01:58:33.779 --> 01:58:37.684]  They would have sent Curly inside to open the door for the other two.
[01:58:37.684 --> 01:58:39.146]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:58:39.146 --> 01:58:40.027]  Stay with us.
[01:58:40.027 --> 01:58:41.048]  More calls straight ahead.
[01:58:41.048 --> 01:58:42.991]  Jimmy, Eric, Rick, and others.
[01:58:42.991 --> 01:58:44.112]  Wolfgang Helbig's our guest.
[01:58:50.010 --> 01:58:51.372]  In the near future.
[01:58:51.372 --> 01:58:55.877]  When you realize how fake it all is, the football, the basketball.
[01:58:55.877 --> 01:58:57.099]  Security alert.
[01:58:57.099 --> 01:58:59.101]  This is Homeland Security.
[01:58:59.101 --> 01:59:02.686]  Analysis, InfoWars, building independent media operations.
[01:59:02.686 --> 01:59:05.409]  You let the worst people get controlled and tell us that we
[01:59:05.589 --> 01:59:07.671]  We are the ones responsible.
[01:59:07.671 --> 01:59:08.711]  Crime Directive.
[01:59:08.711 --> 01:59:10.252]  Discredit Alex Jones.
[01:59:10.252 --> 01:59:13.115]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[01:59:13.115 --> 01:59:16.357]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called InfoWars.
[01:59:16.357 --> 01:59:18.659]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[01:59:18.659 --> 01:59:20.200]  These people are assaulting us.
[01:59:20.200 --> 01:59:23.022]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[01:59:23.022 --> 01:59:24.963]  They are never going to stop.
[01:59:24.963 --> 01:59:29.026]  They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.

[02:00:09.724 --> 02:00:11.305]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.305 --> 02:00:12.846]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:12.846 --> 02:00:17.048]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.048 --> 02:00:21.231]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:21.231 --> 02:00:22.712]  And I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[02:00:22.712 --> 02:00:24.613]  Wolfgang Halberg is our guest.
[02:00:24.613 --> 02:00:25.894]  We're talking about false flags.
[02:00:25.894 --> 02:00:27.695]  We're talking about Sandy Hook.
[02:00:29.424 --> 02:00:34.648]  And all the harassment that goes on trying to keep people from investigating.
[02:00:34.648 --> 02:00:36.570]  He's now filed a lawsuit.
[02:00:36.570 --> 02:00:37.711]  Thanks for your support out there.
[02:00:37.711 --> 02:00:40.573]  Keep it up at SandyHookJustice.com.
[02:00:40.573 --> 02:00:45.677]  Because truth does not run from being investigated.
[02:00:45.677 --> 02:00:47.538]  Eric in Connecticut, you're on the air.
[02:00:47.538 --> 02:00:48.159]  Thanks for holding.
[02:00:48.159 --> 02:00:49.720]  Go ahead.
[02:00:49.720 --> 02:00:50.300]  Hey, how you doing?
[02:00:51.644 --> 02:00:57.006]  First of all, on our license plates out here in Connecticut, it says Constitution State.
[02:00:57.006 --> 02:00:57.606]  Yes.
[02:00:57.606 --> 02:01:01.047]  That couldn't be the furthest thing from the truth.
[02:01:01.047 --> 02:01:05.428]  There hasn't been any elected county government here since the 90s.
[02:01:05.428 --> 02:01:06.808]  No sheriff.
[02:01:06.808 --> 02:01:08.949]  They dissolved it all.
[02:01:08.949 --> 02:01:09.969]  Okay?
[02:01:09.969 --> 02:01:10.669]  So it does.
[02:01:10.669 --> 02:01:12.650]  It makes it impossible for anyone
[02:01:13.968 --> 02:01:16.130]  of the people to investigate this.
[02:01:16.130 --> 02:01:18.851]  Well that's right, Connecticut is where it all started.
[02:01:18.851 --> 02:01:24.235]  Now more than 20 states have done it partially to get rid of sheriffs being elected and quote, combine them into the city.
[02:01:24.235 --> 02:01:32.680]  Well now you have the city that comes from the state and the county, the tail wagging the dog, and then the feds can take it over.
[02:01:32.680 --> 02:01:38.945]  And one more thing, with my own personal investigation with this, is
[02:01:39.986 --> 02:01:46.731]  You find out who Robbie Parker works for and you start really going down the rabbit hole.
[02:01:46.731 --> 02:01:52.935]  Robbie Parker was a solicitor for the CHIPS program.
[02:01:52.935 --> 02:01:55.637]  And tell us what the CHIPS program was.
[02:01:55.637 --> 02:01:59.820]  The CHIPS program is, uh, you register your kids into a database.
[02:01:59.820 --> 02:02:02.542]  The DNA, yeah, the Masons pushed that.
[02:02:02.542 --> 02:02:07.786]  Right, and in order to, like, to prevent the, uh, or to, uh, to prevent the, uh,
[02:02:09.674 --> 02:02:13.195]  Uh, like where kids will go missing and you can find them.
[02:02:13.195 --> 02:02:21.959]  It's just like a registered database for your kids so that they're all in a... sort of like how they have the Amber Alert.
[02:02:21.959 --> 02:02:22.859]  It's related to that.
[02:02:22.859 --> 02:02:31.703]  Now I'm aware of it, and in the schools they have little blue boxes where you get the DNA out of the cheek and thumbprints and fingerprints and all the rest of it.
[02:02:31.703 --> 02:02:32.683]  Thank you so much.
[02:02:32.683 --> 02:02:34.984]  Let's get Wolfgang Halberg's take on what you just said.
[02:02:35.882 --> 02:02:39.965]  Well, you know, I go back, Connecticut corruption.
[02:02:39.965 --> 02:02:45.068]  As a former Florida State Trooper, I looked at Connecticut State Police.
[02:02:45.068 --> 02:02:55.014]  You know the NYPD had to come into Connecticut to investigate the entire Connecticut's Police Department and make recommendations?
[02:02:55.014 --> 02:03:01.578]  They had to disband the Connecticut State Police internal investigators because they were so corrupt.
[02:03:01.578 --> 02:03:02.939]  And look where we are today.
[02:03:03.419 --> 02:03:09.542]  We're simply trying to ask such simple questions and they can't even answer them.
[02:03:09.542 --> 02:03:11.803]  And these are school board policies.
[02:03:11.803 --> 02:03:18.365]  And I'm begging all of your listeners, go to Newtown Public Schools, click on the school board policies.
[02:03:18.365 --> 02:03:24.868]  And let me tell you what, let's use their policies, their rules and regulations to answer these questions.
[02:03:24.868 --> 02:03:26.089]  You know what?
[02:03:26.089 --> 02:03:27.990]  They're in the box and they can't get out.
[02:03:27.990 --> 02:03:28.730]  And we've got them.
[02:03:30.148 --> 02:03:35.133]  Well, it's got to really freak the false flaggers out that people are on their tail.
[02:03:35.133 --> 02:03:37.415]  Let's talk to Rick in West Virginia.
[02:03:37.415 --> 02:03:37.935]  You're on the air.
[02:03:37.935 --> 02:03:39.837]  Go ahead.
[02:03:39.837 --> 02:03:44.161]  Alex, it's an honor to talk to you.
[02:03:44.161 --> 02:03:56.552]  My question for Mr. Halbig is I had heard him say that there had not been one lawsuit filed by the parents of these supposed children against the school board officials.
[02:03:57.495 --> 02:04:03.496]  But yet, about two months ago, I thought a group of the parents were suing the gun manufacturer.
[02:04:03.496 --> 02:04:03.956]  That's right.
[02:04:03.956 --> 02:04:11.318]  And I would like to say, isn't that just further proof that this was a gun control-inspired... That's right.
[02:04:11.318 --> 02:04:15.559]  They have an open... I mean, you've got all these kids killed, all these kids in danger.
[02:04:15.559 --> 02:04:18.500]  Guaranteed, parents or family are going to end up suing.
[02:04:18.500 --> 02:04:20.580]  When it's open and shut, they're going to get a settlement.
[02:04:20.580 --> 02:04:21.520]  But they're not doing that.
[02:04:21.520 --> 02:04:24.181]  They're going after Bushmaster instead.
[02:04:25.484 --> 02:04:26.406]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:04:26.406 --> 02:04:28.470]  I mean, that's the cherry on top.
[02:04:28.470 --> 02:04:29.512]  In fact, stay there, Rick.
[02:04:29.512 --> 02:04:30.234]  Stay there, Wolf King.
[02:04:30.234 --> 02:04:34.362]  I'm going to come back to Rick, let him finish his statement, get Wolf King's take on this in a few more minutes.
[02:04:35.287 --> 02:04:38.228]  Then I'm going to get into a bunch of false flags that governments admit.
[02:04:38.228 --> 02:04:39.629]  Then other news in your phone calls.
[02:04:39.629 --> 02:04:43.970]  We're going to come back to Rick, Dave, Sean, Jim and Sarah in the next segment.
[02:04:43.970 --> 02:04:46.571]  Let those callers finish up on the Sandy Hook investigation.
[02:04:46.571 --> 02:04:48.672]  Get some final comments from Wolfgang Halbig.
[02:04:48.672 --> 02:04:51.413]  But Rick, you just brought up the key point.
[02:04:51.413 --> 02:04:57.075]  They have, years have gone by and they're suing gun manufacturers, not the school that didn't call the helicopters.
[02:04:59.028 --> 02:05:03.630]  The average person's life is filled with unexpected challenges.

[02:05:28.939 --> 02:05:32.601]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[02:05:32.601 --> 02:05:36.863]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[02:05:36.863 --> 02:05:38.644]  Can you put two and two together?
[02:05:38.644 --> 02:05:46.509]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.

[02:05:58.977 --> 02:05:59.918]  Alex Jones here.
[02:05:59.918 --> 02:06:09.142]  For the last two years, I've been working with top doctors, nutritionists, and chemists to design a nutraceutical formulation that has truly life-changing health benefits.
[02:06:09.142 --> 02:06:14.704]  So many other formulations out there contain toxic ingredients, synthetic additives, and even GMOs.
[02:06:14.704 --> 02:06:23.228]  Introducing the all-new Ancient Defense Herbal Immunity Blend, crafted with over 14 key ancient herbs and extracts to supercharge

[02:07:04.694 --> 02:07:09.277]  Introducing the new Infowarslife.com oil of oregano formulation.
[02:07:09.277 --> 02:07:11.339]  A highly advanced nutraceutical form.
[02:07:11.639 --> 02:07:17.223]  of this key herb that has been traditionally used by civilizations for thousands of years to promote health.
[02:07:17.223 --> 02:07:22.747]  We have now procured the most high quality and potent forms of oregano oil on the market.
[02:07:22.747 --> 02:07:28.712]  Sourced from top leading manufacturers to ensure a concentrated level of bioactive ingredients.
[02:07:28.712 --> 02:07:33.655]  Extracted directly from the wild herb and sealed in easy to use capsules.
[02:07:33.655 --> 02:07:37.238]  You will no longer need to endure the burning of liquid oregano on the tongue.
[02:07:37.578 --> 02:07:44.204]  Wild crafted from the Mediterranean oregano species that experts agree is one of the most powerful and most challenging to acquire.
[02:07:44.204 --> 02:07:49.348]  This winter season, it's more important than ever to secure this true form of oil of oregano.

[02:08:09.179 --> 02:08:11.840]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:08:11.840 --> 02:08:13.701]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:08:13.701 --> 02:08:19.324]  It's the time of the season.
[02:08:19.324 --> 02:08:21.985]  When love runs high.
[02:08:21.985 --> 02:08:27.408]  In this time, give it to me easy.
[02:08:27.408 --> 02:08:31.710]  And let me try with pleasured hands.
[02:08:31.710 --> 02:08:34.391]  To take you in this time to promise.
[02:08:36.002 --> 02:08:40.543]  Nations all over the world confess to carrying out state fair attacks.
[02:08:40.543 --> 02:08:43.903]  Gonna break it down coming up after our guest leave us.
[02:08:43.903 --> 02:08:48.044]  I'll expand into Obama's latest executive order.
[02:08:48.044 --> 02:08:49.484]  Confiscation of private property.
[02:08:49.484 --> 02:08:53.165]  That's just some of what's coming up.
[02:08:53.165 --> 02:09:00.566]  The UN drugs body warns US states and Uruguay over cannabis legalization.
[02:09:00.566 --> 02:09:03.087]  The global government says you can't legalize marijuana.
[02:09:04.821 --> 02:09:08.466]  Well, I don't like what marijuana being abused does with potheads.
[02:09:08.466 --> 02:09:16.436]  Makes them live in their mother's basements and turn into gnomes, eating Hot Pockets and playing World of Warcraft and Second Life.
[02:09:16.436 --> 02:09:22.905]  But, if you expand on that to its logical conclusion,
[02:09:24.517 --> 02:09:30.641]  When you allow the drugs to be illegal, it allows big government corporations to ship them in and control them in a black market.
[02:09:30.641 --> 02:09:32.081]  So the answer is decriminalization.
[02:09:32.081 --> 02:09:33.342]  I'm going to be going over that.
[02:09:33.342 --> 02:09:40.946]  Wolfgang Halbig, top school safety advisor, one of the top guys in the country, questioning Sandy Hook.
[02:09:40.946 --> 02:09:46.770]  When we even have debates on here now between people that think it's all true and don't, folks try to censor those.
[02:09:48.297 --> 02:09:51.798]  I mean, this is very un-American, what's going on.
[02:09:51.798 --> 02:09:52.678]  Very dangerous.
[02:09:52.678 --> 02:09:53.679]  We've been investigating it.
[02:09:53.679 --> 02:10:08.623]  But Rick raised the point that several years have gone by since the show, the event, that was the tragic trauma-based mind control that was Sandy Hook, any way you look at it.
[02:10:13.934 --> 02:10:18.878]  Finally, the families are looking at some local suits, but they haven't gotten into that yet.
[02:10:18.878 --> 02:10:20.619]  They're suing Bushmaster.
[02:10:20.619 --> 02:10:21.520]  They'll never win that suit.
[02:10:23.294 --> 02:10:28.796]  Not even with tear jerking, pulling the strings, the heart strings on a stupid jury.
[02:10:28.796 --> 02:10:33.438]  But they would win on the helicopters not being called, on the ambulances standing down.
[02:10:33.438 --> 02:10:34.578]  There would have been huge settlements.
[02:10:34.578 --> 02:10:36.018]  But they don't want that.
[02:10:36.018 --> 02:10:37.359]  They don't want to sue the government.
[02:10:37.359 --> 02:10:38.839]  They don't want to sue the school.
[02:10:38.839 --> 02:10:43.961]  That is another giant red flag that Rick in West Virginia brought up.
[02:10:43.961 --> 02:10:46.462]  We're going to get Wolfgang Halbig's response to that in a moment.
[02:10:46.462 --> 02:10:48.303]  But anything else you want to add, Rick?
[02:10:48.303 --> 02:10:49.723]  Because you're a pretty smart cookie.
[02:10:49.723 --> 02:10:51.964]  I appreciate you bringing that up.
[02:10:53.208 --> 02:11:04.428]  Well, I'd just like to ask, too, is what can we do to bring the truth out about this whenever the officials keep destroying all the evidence?
[02:11:04.428 --> 02:11:04.849]  Wolfgang?
[02:11:06.990 --> 02:11:12.314]  My answer is this, and I've been saying this now for two years, ever since I got involved.
[02:11:12.314 --> 02:11:20.659]  The only way that we are ever going to get the truth is by these subpoenas, is getting these people to raise their right hand.
[02:11:20.659 --> 02:11:22.781]  And you've got to find the weakest link.
[02:11:22.781 --> 02:11:24.902]  There are people out there.
[02:11:24.902 --> 02:11:28.565]  They better get ready because their depositions are going to be taken.
[02:11:28.565 --> 02:11:31.827]  And I'm going to tell you, they're going to be video depositions.
[02:11:31.827 --> 02:11:34.268]  And this is how we're going to get the truth.
[02:11:34.268 --> 02:11:36.530]  They were never expecting us to come along today.
[02:11:36.630 --> 02:11:42.876]  And of course you said you were going to drop this until they sent the state police to your house to basically threaten you for the feds.
[02:11:42.876 --> 02:11:44.177]  Repeat that statement.
[02:11:52.810 --> 02:11:58.933]  Well, yeah, until they sent two homicide investigators to my house, I was quiet as a mouse.
[02:11:58.933 --> 02:12:01.535]  You and I would have never met.
[02:12:01.535 --> 02:12:08.579]  But when they come into my home a week before Christmas with my grandkids, and they threaten and intimidate me, telling me I'm going to be arrested,
[02:12:09.019 --> 02:12:10.099]  And I'm going to go to jail.
[02:12:10.099 --> 02:12:15.141]  And then two weeks later, deputy sheriffs in uniform come to my house.
[02:12:15.141 --> 02:12:20.822]  They said the Newtown police chief might, well, the police chief wants to know if I own handguns.
[02:12:20.822 --> 02:12:25.464]  And if I ever come to Newtown, I need to check in at the police station.
[02:12:25.464 --> 02:12:34.486]  And then I get a phone call from the Southbury Police Department, a sergeant, to tell me never, ever to call the Southbury Port-A-Potty Company again.
[02:12:34.486 --> 02:12:36.227]  Let me tell you, I'm tired of that.
[02:12:36.627 --> 02:12:37.527]  I'm an American.
[02:12:37.527 --> 02:12:39.288]  I'm a naturalized citizen.
[02:12:39.288 --> 02:12:41.088]  I have a right to ask questions.
[02:12:41.088 --> 02:12:44.609]  They're not offensive, and they're not rude.
[02:12:44.609 --> 02:12:46.510]  Well, even if they were offensive, you have a right.
[02:12:46.510 --> 02:12:47.830]  The First Amendment's sacrosanct.
[02:12:47.830 --> 02:12:50.471]  They're trying to overturn it right now.
[02:12:50.471 --> 02:12:52.531]  Well, I've learned to be polite and courteous.
[02:12:52.531 --> 02:12:56.492]  You know, when you're a school administrator, you deal with thousands and thousands of kids.
[02:12:56.492 --> 02:12:58.233]  No, no, I agree it's good to be polite.
[02:12:58.233 --> 02:13:01.594]  I'm just saying the First Amendment has an even higher standard of protection.
[02:13:02.498 --> 02:13:03.939]  I agree.
[02:13:03.939 --> 02:13:05.260]  And, you know, that's what they're doing.
[02:13:05.260 --> 02:13:09.102]  They're attacking our First Amendment, Second Amendment.
[02:13:09.102 --> 02:13:12.745]  And here's the thing, Alex, for people who don't see that's coming.
[02:13:12.745 --> 02:13:23.432]  Connecticut right now is passing laws that any parent who homeschools their child is going to have to have a complete mental health examination.
[02:13:23.432 --> 02:13:27.114]  Now, think about what we're doing to parents and children.
[02:13:27.114 --> 02:13:30.977]  They got to have a complete mental health examination.
[02:13:30.977 --> 02:13:31.037]  Why?
[02:13:34.639 --> 02:13:38.962]  Well, it's a fishing expedition, and it's a way to demonize homeschoolers.
[02:13:38.962 --> 02:13:40.883]  And it's worse than that, statistically.
[02:13:40.883 --> 02:13:45.787]  Homeschoolers get the most scholarships, have the best grades, the lowest crime rate.
[02:13:45.787 --> 02:13:46.667]  Absolutely.
[02:13:46.667 --> 02:13:52.031]  And so, it's becoming so popular, they're trying to shut it down right now.
[02:13:52.031 --> 02:13:55.674]  And Alex, I wish your producer had that clip on the chase in the woods.
[02:13:55.674 --> 02:13:59.256]  I think that's how I'd like to end it with, if you allow me.
[02:13:59.256 --> 02:14:03.119]  Sure, we could play the clip where they supposedly catch the guy in camo in the woods and then say it never happened.
[02:14:03.871 --> 02:14:04.831]  Right.
[02:14:04.831 --> 02:14:10.774]  Your Info Warriors need to see this and they need to spread this message loud and clear.
[02:14:10.774 --> 02:14:12.875]  They need to see this clip.
[02:14:12.875 --> 02:14:17.337]  They're chasing a man in the woods at 12 23 p.m.
[02:14:17.337 --> 02:14:19.057]  on December 14, 2020.
[02:14:19.057 --> 02:14:21.198]  Think about it.
[02:14:21.198 --> 02:14:23.059]  Why are you chasing them after lunch?
[02:14:28.178 --> 02:14:29.679]  Nobody can explain that.
[02:14:29.679 --> 02:14:36.605]  This is actually footage from a live helicopter, and I think the reporter had no clue what he was seeing.
[02:14:36.605 --> 02:14:37.546]  Take a look right here.
[02:14:37.546 --> 02:14:38.487]  They're running.
[02:14:38.487 --> 02:14:41.329]  They're chasing each other at 1223.
[02:14:41.329 --> 02:14:46.674]  They're running by a storage shed that's already broken open by the Connecticut State Police.
[02:14:46.674 --> 02:14:47.375]  It's 1223.
[02:14:47.375 --> 02:14:50.097]  They're running up into the woods.
[02:14:50.097 --> 02:14:51.638]  They're chasing each other.
[02:14:51.638 --> 02:14:53.860]  But Alex, nobody knows who's chasing who.
[02:14:54.821 --> 02:14:59.963]  The school was deemed completely safe by 10.30 a.m.
[02:14:59.963 --> 02:15:00.983]  that morning.
[02:15:00.983 --> 02:15:03.244]  If that is a true statement, look at these guys.
[02:15:03.244 --> 02:15:05.785]  They're actually walking away from San Diego.
[02:15:05.785 --> 02:15:08.766]  It makes it look like they're going to San Diego.
[02:15:08.766 --> 02:15:11.627]  Everything has been documented.
[02:15:11.627 --> 02:15:16.229]  Sure, they're shooting footage to later show the police, you know, trying to chase bad guys.
[02:15:16.829 --> 02:15:19.210]  But it's actually all scripted just like a movie.
[02:15:19.210 --> 02:15:21.831]  They were just shooting it later in production.
[02:15:21.831 --> 02:15:26.932]  That's why they said that the event never happened and didn't know that the helicopter footage had already gone out.
[02:15:26.932 --> 02:15:34.574]  Thank you, and Alex, that's true because at 9.39 that morning, all you have to do is take the Newtown Police Dispatcher.
[02:15:34.574 --> 02:15:39.956]  See, he got everybody in America hooked in partnership with the national news media.
[02:15:39.956 --> 02:15:42.937]  At 9.39, he broadcasts where everybody hears it.
[02:15:43.357 --> 02:15:48.300]  A teacher just reported seeing two shadows running behind the gym.
[02:15:48.300 --> 02:15:49.101]  Well, guess what?
[02:15:49.101 --> 02:15:50.062]  I'm watching.
[02:15:50.062 --> 02:15:52.383]  I want to see them catch those two shadows.
[02:15:52.383 --> 02:15:54.344]  Maybe there's going to be a shootout.
[02:15:54.344 --> 02:16:02.470]  And then the national news media, they show the chase into the woods, assuming, Alex, that you and I are watching a chase in the morning.
[02:16:02.930 --> 02:16:05.511]  Then we're going to bring this shooting to closure.
[02:16:05.511 --> 02:16:09.773]  Alex, that shooting chase didn't happen until after lunch.
[02:16:09.773 --> 02:16:10.333]  They lied.
[02:16:10.333 --> 02:16:11.473]  No, they didn't even script it.
[02:16:11.473 --> 02:16:17.776]  It's kind of like when they, in Indonesia and a couple other countries, had Lee Harvey Oswald caught as the shooter of Kennedy.
[02:16:18.656 --> 02:16:24.981]  About an hour before they even grabbed him, and then it was hours after that until they declared his name, they got the time zone screwed up.
[02:16:24.981 --> 02:16:30.845]  Just like on 9-11, they blew up Building 7 early, and said, oh, it's fallen, it fell on its own footprint.
[02:16:30.845 --> 02:16:37.050]  An hour before it fell, and then 25 minutes before it fell, they announced it fell, but the reporter's like, but it hasn't fallen.
[02:16:37.050 --> 02:16:39.572]  And I said, BBC's fed by Reuters.
[02:16:39.572 --> 02:16:41.073]  Reuters jumped the gun.
[02:16:41.073 --> 02:16:44.695]  Five years later, they admitted, yes, we were given that by Reuters.
[02:16:44.695 --> 02:16:46.457]  So, we just keep catching them.
[02:16:47.237 --> 02:16:48.257]  Rick, thanks for the call.
[02:16:48.257 --> 02:16:50.998]  Dave, quick question for Wolfgang Halbig.
[02:16:50.998 --> 02:16:54.299]  Go ahead.
[02:16:54.299 --> 02:16:55.440]  Hi Alex and Wolfgang.
[02:16:55.440 --> 02:16:58.521]  Stay after these guys because we got them on the run.
[02:16:58.521 --> 02:17:04.923]  I watched the quarter and he said that the rifle is what caused all those wounds.
[02:17:04.923 --> 02:17:08.824]  And then later on the news I saw, hey, Adam Lanza's rifle was in his car.
[02:17:09.660 --> 02:17:14.182]  And it's kind of strange to me that they don't even try to change their story or anything.
[02:17:14.182 --> 02:17:15.663]  It's just out there for us to see.
[02:17:15.663 --> 02:17:18.344]  Well, they said Obamacare would cut your prices and it hasn't.
[02:17:18.344 --> 02:17:20.265]  They said 2 plus 2 equals 5.
[02:17:20.265 --> 02:17:21.485]  It's just they're a pack of liars.
[02:17:21.485 --> 02:17:29.729]  I mean, Obama said raising the debt limit doesn't raise the debt.
[02:17:29.729 --> 02:17:30.750]  Good point, Dave.
[02:17:30.750 --> 02:17:32.570]  Let's go to Jim in Connecticut.
[02:17:32.570 --> 02:17:34.731]  You're on the air, Jim.
[02:17:34.731 --> 02:17:35.432]  Good morning, gentlemen.
[02:17:35.432 --> 02:17:36.472]  How are you guys doing?
[02:17:36.472 --> 02:17:37.573]  Well, we're doing all right, brother.
[02:17:37.573 --> 02:17:37.873]  Go ahead.
[02:17:39.025 --> 02:17:40.707]  This is Jim with We Are Change Connecticut.
[02:17:40.707 --> 02:17:41.128]  How big?
[02:17:41.128 --> 02:17:42.370]  We were with you last time.
[02:17:42.370 --> 02:17:47.617]  We just want to know, what else can we do in Connecticut to prepare you for your case?
[02:17:47.617 --> 02:17:48.719]  Anything we can do for you, sir.
[02:17:49.502 --> 02:17:56.304]  Yeah, go to the Newtown Public School Board and look at those school board policies and procedures.
[02:17:56.304 --> 02:18:07.708]  Look at the questions that Alex has on his website and contact the school board members and demand that they answer those questions which are part of their school board policy.
[02:18:07.708 --> 02:18:08.769]  It's the law.
[02:18:08.769 --> 02:18:10.109]  They don't have a choice.
[02:18:10.109 --> 02:18:12.730]  They must respond.
[02:18:12.730 --> 02:18:13.631]  Alright, thank you Jim.
[02:18:13.631 --> 02:18:14.811]  Good to hear from you.
[02:18:14.811 --> 02:18:16.091]  Sharon, Indiana, go ahead.
[02:18:16.091 --> 02:18:17.172]  You're on the air with Halbut.
[02:18:17.172 --> 02:18:17.492]  Go ahead.
[02:18:19.069 --> 02:18:37.863]  Hi, for your investigation, I would suggest looking at some of the mental health regulations that came about because of this whole situation and maybe following some of the key players or the money that's involved in that and also looking at those people and their associations, you know, kind of using that web of information against them like they do against us.
[02:18:39.683 --> 02:18:42.726]  Can I tell you, I totally agree with you, but look at me.
[02:18:42.726 --> 02:18:44.348]  I'm a 68 year old guy.
[02:18:44.348 --> 02:18:45.229]  I'm retired.
[02:18:45.229 --> 02:18:46.290]  I'm old.
[02:18:46.290 --> 02:18:50.434]  I'm only one person taking on a huge challenge.
[02:18:50.434 --> 02:18:52.075]  Well, you already had a great effect, ma'am.
[02:18:52.075 --> 02:18:53.176]  Thank you for the call.
[02:18:53.176 --> 02:18:58.181]  I'm out of time for Jimmy, Chris, Mary, and others, but I'll take your calls after Wolfgang has to leave us here in a moment.
[02:18:58.181 --> 02:19:00.403]  But Wolfgang, you say this is hurting your family.
[02:19:00.403 --> 02:19:01.484]  I bet your wife's sick of it.
[02:19:02.085 --> 02:19:03.186]  I mean, the evidence is there.
[02:19:03.186 --> 02:19:10.153]  It's not just that I believe you're doing a good job because of the fact that you have stuff to lose and that you don't have a motive.
[02:19:10.153 --> 02:19:12.215]  It's that I can see the same stuff you're seeing.
[02:19:12.215 --> 02:19:14.217]  I'm not an expert, but I've been studying it.
[02:19:14.217 --> 02:19:18.462]  So we should all pray for you and your family, and I hope your wife and folks stand by him.
[02:19:19.346 --> 02:19:21.908]  Well, you know, my wife is like millions of others, Alex.
[02:19:21.908 --> 02:19:25.771]  She's refusing to actually read it and look at it.
[02:19:25.771 --> 02:19:28.873]  And I think that's what's happening to millions across the country.
[02:19:28.873 --> 02:19:33.577]  They were touched emotionally and they were brainwashed by the national news media.
[02:19:33.577 --> 02:19:34.958]  They were traumatized.
[02:19:34.958 --> 02:19:36.259]  Yeah, they were traumatized.
[02:19:36.259 --> 02:19:37.219]  And that's where we are.
[02:19:37.219 --> 02:19:37.840]  And we need to
[02:19:38.260 --> 02:19:42.863]  Show them that they lied to us, that this was a conspiracy.
[02:19:42.863 --> 02:19:43.984]  Well, I just commend you.
[02:19:43.984 --> 02:19:46.085]  Folks should certainly be praying for Wolfgang.
[02:19:46.085 --> 02:19:48.126]  They should go to his website and support him.
[02:19:48.126 --> 02:19:49.527]  SandyHookJustice.com.
[02:19:49.527 --> 02:19:50.408]  We salute you.

[02:19:52.589 --> 02:19:53.670]  Folks, stand with him.
[02:19:53.670 --> 02:19:55.631]  He's fighting for all of us and for the Second Amendment.
[02:19:55.631 --> 02:19:56.111]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:19:56.111 --> 02:19:56.692]  Thank you.
[02:19:56.692 --> 02:19:56.992]  Thank you.
[02:19:59.262 --> 02:20:00.423]  It's happening again.

[02:23:27.159 --> 02:23:28.260]  This is an alert.
[02:23:28.260 --> 02:23:32.362]  If your business or church is building this year, you're about to pay more than you should.
[02:23:32.362 --> 02:23:36.565]  This could mean thousands of dollars more for your office, retail space, church, or warehouse.
[02:23:36.565 --> 02:23:41.949]  A General Steel building can save you as much as half the cost and time of similar conventional construction.

[02:23:49.413 --> 02:23:49.734]  That's 866-917-8335.
[02:24:04.500 --> 02:24:06.061]  We are on the march.
[02:24:06.061 --> 02:24:10.562]  The empire of tyranny and lies is on the run.
[02:24:10.562 --> 02:24:11.543]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[02:24:11.543 --> 02:24:12.983]  Thank you for joining us.
[02:24:12.983 --> 02:24:21.327]  I'll continue now that we're on a false flag discussion with Jimmy, Ray, Jay, Chris, Mary, and many others that are holding.
[02:24:21.327 --> 02:24:27.029]  And I do have some good news on the Second Amendment, along with the bad news, and on the organic food front.
[02:24:28.365 --> 02:24:32.111]  Fifth Monkey has signs of deadly bacteria and lab mishap.
[02:24:32.111 --> 02:24:32.372]  U.S.
[02:24:32.372 --> 02:24:37.460]  faces $90,000 doctor shortage because of Obamacare, basically, The Washington Post.
[02:24:37.460 --> 02:24:42.187]  Target to cut jobs as part of $2 billion cost savings plan, showing this country's in major recession.
[02:24:44.144 --> 02:24:45.624]  Got a trillion dollars.
[02:24:45.624 --> 02:24:48.525]  The world's first trillionaire already in the making.
[02:24:48.525 --> 02:24:50.486]  Half of human age came from gorillas.
[02:24:50.486 --> 02:24:54.067]  That's in the London Independent, the London Telegraph.
[02:24:54.067 --> 02:24:55.288]  That's just some of what's coming up.
[02:24:55.288 --> 02:24:57.768]  But let me go ahead and get into false flags right now.
[02:24:57.768 --> 02:25:01.589]  We go back 20 years ago, people didn't know what the term false flag was.
[02:25:01.589 --> 02:25:03.690]  They also didn't know the Federal Reserve was private.
[02:25:03.690 --> 02:25:05.791]  That shows how far we've come identifying what's going on.
[02:25:06.491 --> 02:25:08.813]  Ten years ago, people didn't know what false flag was.
[02:25:08.813 --> 02:25:11.114]  Now, it's in the vernacular.
[02:25:11.114 --> 02:25:12.755]  It's in the language.
[02:25:12.755 --> 02:25:17.199]  Stage terror, self-inflicted wound, inside job, frame job.
[02:25:17.199 --> 02:25:19.700]  It's now known.
[02:25:19.700 --> 02:25:25.224]  And calling us conspiracy theorists and tenfold hat people doesn't work anymore, does it?
[02:25:25.224 --> 02:25:28.446]  As MSNBC basically considers closing its doors.
[02:25:28.446 --> 02:25:30.368]  Another major reorganization.
[02:25:30.368 --> 02:25:32.209]  You don't exist anymore.
[02:25:32.209 --> 02:25:34.751]  Go up there and say I'm behind the Boston bombing all you want.
[02:25:36.578 --> 02:25:38.359]  Go on there and sound a racist all you want.
[02:25:38.359 --> 02:25:40.921]  Everybody who actually tunes in finds out you're a bunch of liars.
[02:25:40.921 --> 02:25:48.748]  And we're just going to get to a point where the people in the system don't want to be slaves, don't want to be criminals.
[02:25:48.748 --> 02:25:56.574]  The criminals have to manipulate good people in the system, whether it's private or public, into being part of it with these cover stories.
[02:25:56.574 --> 02:26:01.258]  Well, these cover narratives, these roles as they call them, don't fly.
[02:26:02.756 --> 02:26:10.121]  We got a saying down here in Texas, that dog won't hunt.
[02:26:10.121 --> 02:26:14.585]  And there's another saying, I don't have a dog in the fight.
[02:26:14.585 --> 02:26:18.127]  I think that saying's nationwide.
[02:26:18.127 --> 02:26:20.889]  People in the system, on average, are not evil or corrupt.
[02:26:20.889 --> 02:26:28.335]  They're just now waking up, and they're understanding, A, the dog won't hunt, and A, they don't have a dog in the fight.
[02:26:30.017 --> 02:26:33.402]  And so we have intellectual facts, history, common sense, research.
[02:26:33.402 --> 02:26:39.110]  We compare what the criminals running things said one week ago compared to now, five years ago compared to now.
[02:26:39.110 --> 02:26:41.994]  We show their manipulation.
[02:26:41.994 --> 02:26:45.579]  And it doesn't matter if they got half the public sucking their thumb, not knowing which end is up.
[02:26:47.358 --> 02:26:51.639]  A large portion of the public worldwide is really starting to get it now.
[02:26:51.639 --> 02:27:07.883]  And if a minority, a sizable minority, ever wakes up and doesn't comply, and starts voting with their dollars, with their euros, with their yen, their yuan, their rubles, their shekels, their pesos, that's it for the establishment.
[02:27:07.883 --> 02:27:09.623]  And that's why they're in a race to kill choice.
[02:27:09.623 --> 02:27:12.524]  In fact, let me hit this now and I'll hit false flags in the next segment and then go to calls.
[02:27:13.894 --> 02:27:16.196]  MarketWatch, that's Wall Street Journal.
[02:27:16.196 --> 02:27:24.080]  McDonald's new menu policy will only use chickens raised without antibiotics.
[02:27:24.080 --> 02:27:29.444]  Richard walked in here today to give this to me and he said a minor victory.
[02:27:29.444 --> 02:27:33.106]  Not trying to overplay it and I said this is a huge victory.
[02:27:33.106 --> 02:27:40.871]  Because if you add Kraft and just every week some new giant company saying we're not going to use GMO, we're going to label
[02:27:43.220 --> 02:27:46.004]  We're not going to have food fed with antibiotics.
[02:27:46.004 --> 02:27:50.489]  We're not going to add plasticizers into our food, which they sell in Europe.
[02:27:50.489 --> 02:27:51.891]  You know, it's illegal.
[02:27:51.891 --> 02:27:55.836]  We're going to sell you European varieties of food.
[02:27:55.836 --> 02:27:59.221]  Produced and packaged here in America.
[02:27:59.221 --> 02:28:00.062]  It's not hard for them.
[02:28:02.335 --> 02:28:07.716]  But you put the pressure on them, and this is a microcosm of what could bring down the entire New World Order.
[02:28:07.716 --> 02:28:19.599]  That's why they're in a naked, all-out, bum rush to just get everything shut down, except for globalist operations that are tax-exempt, Obamacare-exempt, exempt from harassment.
[02:28:19.599 --> 02:28:26.381]  That's what globalism and the technocracy is about, is surveilling everything to selectively shut down everything not run by them.
[02:28:27.646 --> 02:28:30.367]  That's Robert Barron, John D. Rockefeller.
[02:28:30.367 --> 02:28:34.169]  Competition is a sin 101.
[02:28:34.169 --> 02:28:39.191]  Only way McDonald's can survive is to shut down all their competition.
[02:28:39.191 --> 02:28:42.813]  But we're gonna shut them down before that happens.
[02:28:42.813 --> 02:28:44.774]  And I'm sorry if you own a McDonald's franchise.
[02:28:44.774 --> 02:28:47.415]  I got my right to vote with my dollars and my mouth.
[02:28:47.415 --> 02:28:51.857]  And I got a big fat mouth like a crocodile.
[02:28:51.857 --> 02:28:53.998]  That means we gotta come back with Bang Your Head in the next segment.
[02:28:55.492 --> 02:29:13.424]  McDonald's MCD on the stock market has announced on Wednesday a new, and by the way their stock shot up when they did it, 69 cents, a new menu policy Wednesday to only use chickens raised without antibiotics and to offer milk from cows that aren't treated with artificial growth hormones.
[02:29:13.424 --> 02:29:14.264]  Yeah!
[02:29:14.264 --> 02:29:15.845]  Another victory!
[02:29:15.845 --> 02:29:16.646]  Forgot to mention that one.
[02:29:18.516 --> 02:29:21.619]  Dryer's Ice Cream came out two weeks ago and said the same.
[02:29:21.619 --> 02:29:23.580]  All the big brands are saying, you know what?
[02:29:23.580 --> 02:29:25.102]  You don't want high fructose corn syrup?
[02:29:25.102 --> 02:29:26.063]  Fine.
[02:29:26.063 --> 02:29:27.584]  You don't want GMO growth hormones?
[02:29:27.584 --> 02:29:30.306]  Your kids are a foot taller and get cancer when they're 14?
[02:29:30.306 --> 02:29:31.107]  Okay.
[02:29:31.107 --> 02:29:32.568]  You don't want plasticizers in the nuggets?
[02:29:32.568 --> 02:29:34.089]  You got it.
[02:29:34.089 --> 02:29:35.290]  Listen, I'm out on the road somewhere.
[02:29:35.290 --> 02:29:37.292]  I want to be able to pull over and get a hamburger.
[02:29:37.292 --> 02:29:40.075]  I don't like these food deserts, but I will not eat
[02:29:41.220 --> 02:29:44.203]  When I'm on a road trip, before I eat your crap.
[02:29:44.203 --> 02:29:45.084]  Any of this fast food.
[02:29:45.084 --> 02:29:47.125]  So I want McDonald's to reform itself.
[02:29:47.125 --> 02:29:48.267]  And we're winning.
[02:29:48.267 --> 02:29:49.167]  This is big.
[02:29:49.167 --> 02:29:49.768]  This is big.
[02:29:49.768 --> 02:29:50.108]  Stay with us.
[02:29:50.108 --> 02:29:52.530]  We're on the march.
[02:29:52.530 --> 02:29:54.272]  You hear that?
[02:29:54.272 --> 02:29:54.672]  You hear that?
[02:29:54.672 --> 02:29:55.593]  We're on the march.
[02:29:55.593 --> 02:29:56.174]  We're on the march.
[02:29:59.167 --> 02:30:00.427]  Another major health threat.
[02:30:00.427 --> 02:30:05.409]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[02:30:05.409 --> 02:30:08.070]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[02:30:08.070 --> 02:30:15.112]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[02:30:15.112 --> 02:30:18.093]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[02:30:18.093 --> 02:30:21.134]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[02:30:21.134 --> 02:30:23.094]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[02:30:23.094 --> 02:30:25.915]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[02:30:26.015 --> 02:30:31.737]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[02:30:31.737 --> 02:30:35.238]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[02:30:35.238 --> 02:30:38.339]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[02:30:38.339 --> 02:30:45.662]  The ProPure Pro1 G2.0 Water Filtration System is a must-have for every modern, independently-minded household.

[02:33:11.351 --> 02:33:15.413]  Time to bang our head up against the New World Order and see who gives up first.
[02:33:15.413 --> 02:33:17.414]  Wanna bang heads with me?
[02:33:17.414 --> 02:33:19.115]  You want to stop tyranny?
[02:33:19.115 --> 02:33:20.776]  Well, so does he.
[02:33:20.776 --> 02:33:25.499]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:25.499 --> 02:33:29.221]  I'm Alex Jones, your host, and I love ya!
[02:33:29.221 --> 02:33:32.482]  The headline just went up on InfoWars.com.
[02:33:32.482 --> 02:33:34.143]  Maybe somebody else pointed it out.
[02:33:34.143 --> 02:33:36.244]  I hadn't even thought of it.
[02:33:36.244 --> 02:33:38.926]  Hiding in plain view, Kit Daniels thought of it.
[02:33:40.689 --> 02:33:57.392]  What about all the people that Hillary communicated with, with an illegal secret email, when under federal law all these communications are to be recorded and documented by the Secretary of State?
[02:33:57.392 --> 02:34:02.213]  Obviously they're starting a new whitewash in Congress about it, but who are the people that are the aliases?
[02:34:02.213 --> 02:34:03.953]  That's been asked, but here's the other issue.
[02:34:03.953 --> 02:34:06.233]  She's talking to the White House, the State Department.
[02:34:06.233 --> 02:34:08.814]  All of those people are now
[02:34:10.285 --> 02:34:12.787]  Involves aiding and abetting, and it gets worse.
[02:34:12.787 --> 02:34:23.715]  She's communicating with aliases, not just hers, but with gnome-de-plumes, pen names, in official State Department business with these people.
[02:34:23.715 --> 02:34:28.959]  So, see, you... Now, of course, this is all just hiding in plain view, common sense, default, to think of it.
[02:34:28.959 --> 02:34:32.561]  We just are so busy covering so many issues, and so is everybody else.
[02:34:32.561 --> 02:34:34.683]  What about the people she was talking to?
[02:34:36.297 --> 02:34:41.781]  White House never questioned Clinton's private email during her four-year Secretary of State tenure.
[02:34:41.781 --> 02:34:46.705]  Obama admin didn't care Clinton used private, unsecure email in exchanges with the White House.
[02:34:48.030 --> 02:34:49.431]  Excellent job.
[02:34:49.431 --> 02:34:55.055]  In fact, I asked Kit to change the headline to, White House involved in illegal email with Hillary Clinton.
[02:34:55.055 --> 02:35:03.481]  Media, you know, deaf, or not deaf, media silent on issue, but his sub-headline is better than what I gave him during the break.
[02:35:03.481 --> 02:35:04.942]  Obama admin didn't care.
[02:35:04.942 --> 02:35:11.047]  Obama administration was complicit in letting Clinton use private, unsecure email.
[02:35:11.047 --> 02:35:11.567]  That's the word.
[02:35:11.567 --> 02:35:13.649]  It's not that they didn't care, they were complicit.
[02:35:13.649 --> 02:35:15.110]  Change that to complicit and we got it.
[02:35:16.374 --> 02:35:18.718]  We're so busy around here, there's total transparency.
[02:35:18.718 --> 02:35:19.901]  I tell the crew to correct me.
[02:35:19.901 --> 02:35:20.903]  I try to help them.
[02:35:20.903 --> 02:35:25.632]  I tell you, a lot of this crew is smarter than I am on a lot of subjects.
[02:35:25.632 --> 02:35:26.473]  I just have the old...
[02:35:27.836 --> 02:35:30.178]  Knowledge of kind of one of the old Mossbacks.
[02:35:30.178 --> 02:35:32.260]  20 years doing this is a long time.
[02:35:32.260 --> 02:35:35.883]  I've just learned how people operate, how enemies are going to come at us.
[02:35:35.883 --> 02:35:38.586]  I've kind of got the knowledge.
[02:35:38.586 --> 02:35:44.791]  But when it comes to just events and angles and stuff, it's great to have this team.
[02:35:44.791 --> 02:35:50.136]  That's why I invite the team in there in the control room to pop in whenever they want because they have a lot of great points.
[02:35:50.136 --> 02:35:51.858]  Kind of encouraging them right now to pop in.
[02:35:52.578 --> 02:35:53.979]  Uh, wow, that was weird.
[02:35:53.979 --> 02:36:00.105]  They just did a document cam shot, and I looked over out of the corner of my eye, and there's a giant hand on the wall.
[02:36:00.105 --> 02:36:01.006]  I was like, what is that?
[02:36:01.006 --> 02:36:02.267]  I was like, ah!
[02:36:02.267 --> 02:36:03.067]  It's scary!
[02:36:03.067 --> 02:36:03.468]  No!
[02:36:03.468 --> 02:36:03.988]  Don't get me!
[02:36:03.988 --> 02:36:10.494]  Alright, now I'm getting silly, and there's so much... I'm crushing your head.
[02:36:10.494 --> 02:36:14.698]  What show was that, on HBO, where they would crush, crush?
[02:36:14.698 --> 02:36:17.921]  What?
[02:36:17.921 --> 02:36:19.102]  Uh, that was Kids in the Hall.
[02:36:19.758 --> 02:36:20.959]  Kids in the hall.
[02:36:20.959 --> 02:36:22.280]  All right.
[02:36:22.280 --> 02:36:25.582]  Jennings, did you just come on air?
[02:36:25.582 --> 02:36:26.542]  Just for a moment.
[02:36:26.542 --> 02:36:27.743]  I like that.
[02:36:27.743 --> 02:36:30.205]  See, you're not just talking to me and people think I'm crazy.
[02:36:30.205 --> 02:36:31.966]  You're actually on air.
[02:36:31.966 --> 02:36:34.347]  Let's talk to Joe Jennings.
[02:36:34.347 --> 02:36:35.528]  I do exist.
[02:36:35.528 --> 02:36:38.510]  Joe, who's your favorite reporter at InfoWars?
[02:36:38.510 --> 02:36:40.731]  Not a trick question.
[02:36:40.731 --> 02:36:42.392]  Me.
[02:36:42.392 --> 02:36:43.473]  Absolutely.
[02:36:43.473 --> 02:36:44.654]  You are a reporter as well.
[02:36:45.503 --> 02:36:54.408]  You're just, you don't have to be, you know, quote, festooned with crowns to be someone able to comment on what they're seeing happening.
[02:36:54.408 --> 02:36:55.828]  I can't incriminate myself.
[02:36:55.828 --> 02:37:01.711]  If I say any other person other than Leanne McAdoo, I'll be in trouble.
[02:37:01.711 --> 02:37:06.134]  Now, do you guys have your feet on TV right now?
[02:37:06.134 --> 02:37:07.534]  We're right here.
[02:37:07.534 --> 02:37:09.475]  Yeah, no, I want, yeah, exactly.
[02:37:09.475 --> 02:37:12.317]  See, when you're talking, I want you on television.
[02:37:13.328 --> 02:37:14.189]  I like that other shot.
[02:37:14.189 --> 02:37:14.729]  Go to the other shot.
[02:37:14.729 --> 02:37:18.252]  That's really a cool shot you've got in preview.
[02:37:18.252 --> 02:37:19.213]  No, no, no.
[02:37:19.213 --> 02:37:20.874]  The one where it's the side shot.
[02:37:20.874 --> 02:37:23.076]  That shot right there is awesome.
[02:37:23.076 --> 02:37:23.416]  No, no.
[02:37:23.416 --> 02:37:24.877]  The shot of you.
[02:37:24.877 --> 02:37:26.499]  The shot where it's from the side.
[02:37:26.499 --> 02:37:28.780]  Of you, Joe Jennings.
[02:37:28.780 --> 02:37:30.762]  I'm not pressing any buttons here.
[02:37:30.762 --> 02:37:31.983]  Who is doing it?
[02:37:31.983 --> 02:37:32.804]  No, that's live, actually.
[02:37:32.804 --> 02:37:33.824]  I'm going to come in there.
[02:37:33.824 --> 02:37:36.547]  We haven't had the... We don't have the other feed patched in.
[02:37:36.547 --> 02:37:37.748]  That is an awesome feed.
[02:37:37.748 --> 02:37:40.150]  That is the best shot of the studio right there.
[02:37:40.150 --> 02:37:41.771]  It looks like you're in a submarine or something.
[02:37:43.837 --> 02:37:46.418]  This is the fortress.
[02:37:46.418 --> 02:37:47.819]  The fortress of solitude.
[02:37:47.819 --> 02:37:49.559]  That's right.
[02:37:49.559 --> 02:37:53.981]  Where you find the most fabulous object in the world.
[02:37:53.981 --> 02:37:56.402]  Where we hide all the secrets.
[02:37:56.402 --> 02:37:58.623]  You know, I don't think there's any secrets around here, actually.
[02:37:58.623 --> 02:38:00.523]  We're pretty darn transparent.
[02:38:00.523 --> 02:38:02.384]  So you're unable to hook this great feed in?
[02:38:02.384 --> 02:38:04.225]  That is the feed I like.
[02:38:04.225 --> 02:38:05.685]  That is an awesome feed.
[02:38:05.685 --> 02:38:10.927]  The answer is to wheel this camera around and aim it at that TV and we'll get the feed.
[02:38:10.927 --> 02:38:12.208]  See, now I'm obsessing.
[02:38:13.578 --> 02:38:18.599]  You're a radio listener and people are like, what on earth is this maniac talking about?
[02:38:18.599 --> 02:38:19.900]  Who's he talking to?
[02:38:19.900 --> 02:38:21.200]  Who's he talking to?
[02:38:21.200 --> 02:38:21.840]  There we go.
[02:38:21.840 --> 02:38:24.901]  Now you can zoom in right there and we can still see the feed.
[02:38:24.901 --> 02:38:27.121]  There you go.
[02:38:27.121 --> 02:38:29.382]  There you go.
[02:38:29.382 --> 02:38:33.143]  There's more than one way to skin a possum.
[02:38:33.143 --> 02:38:35.723]  Joe Jennings, have you ever had possum?
[02:38:35.723 --> 02:38:36.123]  I have.
[02:38:36.123 --> 02:38:38.224]  It's not very delicious.
[02:38:38.928 --> 02:38:41.650]  My goodness, my dad's had possum growing up in East Texas.
[02:38:41.650 --> 02:38:47.394]  I haven't had the pleasure of possum in sweet potato pie.
[02:38:47.394 --> 02:38:51.637]  But, oh yeah, that's a real dish.
[02:38:51.637 --> 02:38:55.540]  My grandfather's favorite was called Son of a Gun.
[02:38:55.540 --> 02:38:59.443]  It has bulls, you know.
[02:38:59.443 --> 02:39:01.224]  Oh, you're talking about Rocky Mountain Oysters?
[02:39:01.224 --> 02:39:02.065]  Oh, yes.
[02:39:02.065 --> 02:39:04.547]  But he called it Son of a Gun.
[02:39:04.547 --> 02:39:05.427]  Son of a Gun.
[02:39:06.877 --> 02:39:09.079]  All right, now let's cut back to you, Sideshot.
[02:39:09.079 --> 02:39:10.820]  There you go.
[02:39:10.820 --> 02:39:12.942]  See, there's more than one way to get this job done.
[02:39:12.942 --> 02:39:14.063]  Look at that.
[02:39:14.063 --> 02:39:24.092]  And look at Marcos Morales wearing that 1776 hat, available at the InfoWars store, Made in America, madein1776.com.
[02:39:24.092 --> 02:39:27.194]  Hey, Marcos Morales, how are you doing, my friend?
[02:39:27.194 --> 02:39:31.398]  Doing excellent.
[02:39:31.398 --> 02:39:33.520]  I'm just now starting to be a regular on the radio.
[02:39:34.639 --> 02:39:37.860]  That's right, and you will learn to put the microphone closer to your face.
[02:39:37.860 --> 02:39:41.702]  Marcos used to run the whole TV station for a local Fox affiliate.
[02:39:41.702 --> 02:39:46.483]  He's a very skilled person, though he doesn't want to be on air, so we're going to make him.
[02:39:46.483 --> 02:39:48.044]  I start jabbering too much.
[02:39:48.044 --> 02:39:49.645]  I'm behind the camera talent.
[02:39:49.645 --> 02:39:50.485]  Oh, come on, Marcos.
[02:39:50.485 --> 02:39:53.466]  I'm not made for the big screen.
[02:39:53.466 --> 02:39:54.627]  We need to go play pool again.
[02:39:54.627 --> 02:39:56.867]  How long has it been since we went and played pool?
[02:39:56.867 --> 02:39:58.208]  We just got busy.
[02:39:58.208 --> 02:40:01.069]  We got busy with this new studio and haven't had any time for fun.
[02:40:02.341 --> 02:40:07.129]  All that's done, you did come to the birthday party for one of my daughters and brought your, that was a lot of fun.
[02:40:07.129 --> 02:40:09.473]  That was a lot of fun.
[02:40:09.473 --> 02:40:13.119]  Had the kids, bunch of unvaccinated kids playing in the pool together.
[02:40:13.119 --> 02:40:13.880]  It was terrible.
[02:40:13.880 --> 02:40:15.383]  It was very, very extremist.
[02:40:16.001 --> 02:40:18.082]  Very, very terrorist, terrorist act.
[02:40:37.236 --> 02:40:47.386]  Taking the synthetic growth hormone out of their cheese and milk and saying that they'll no longer get chicken with all the antibiotics in it, that is really good news.
[02:40:47.386 --> 02:40:55.854]  But you know, it's only happening as McDonald's profits implode and every major big globalist fast food chain basically is engaged in a death spiral right now.
[02:40:55.854 --> 02:40:57.735]  Is that not the ultimate microcosm?
[02:40:58.436 --> 02:41:02.060]  Nico Acosta, let's just make him get on the microphone.
[02:41:02.060 --> 02:41:03.141]  Nico, what do you think?
[02:41:03.141 --> 02:41:04.623]  Was Richard brought to my attention?
[02:41:04.623 --> 02:41:09.548]  First Nico's take, and then Richard's take.
[02:41:09.548 --> 02:41:10.849]  Sorry, I was trying to produce the show.
[02:41:10.849 --> 02:41:12.411]  What are you asking me?
[02:41:12.411 --> 02:41:14.873]  How big a victory is this about McDonald's?
[02:41:14.873 --> 02:41:15.474]  Oh, that's great.
[02:41:15.474 --> 02:41:19.738]  Yeah, it's right in line with all the food babe initiatives.
[02:41:19.738 --> 02:41:21.060]  Pretty soon they're all going to start falling that way.
[02:41:22.040 --> 02:41:22.881]  Absolutely.
[02:41:22.881 --> 02:41:25.762]  Okay, next, let's go and talk to Richard.
[02:41:25.762 --> 02:41:27.043]  I don't know if Richard wants his last name out.
[02:41:27.043 --> 02:41:28.624]  He's one of the new guys who does a great job.
[02:41:28.624 --> 02:41:29.884]  Been here about six months.
[02:41:29.884 --> 02:41:31.185]  Hey, Richard, give us your take.
[02:41:31.185 --> 02:41:33.867]  I mean, you call this a victory.
[02:41:33.867 --> 02:41:36.428]  I think it's huge when you see all the other dominoes falling.
[02:41:36.428 --> 02:41:38.869]  This shows the power of voting with our dollars.
[02:41:38.869 --> 02:41:40.730]  This really should be an example to everybody.
[02:41:40.730 --> 02:41:41.671]  What do you think, Richard?
[02:41:41.671 --> 02:41:42.311]  I agree.
[02:41:42.311 --> 02:41:44.993]  Yeah, I said it was a minor victory when I handed it to you.
[02:41:44.993 --> 02:41:47.174]  I did downplay it a little bit, but it is.
[02:41:47.174 --> 02:41:50.576]  Especially, arguably, the largest company
[02:41:51.819 --> 02:41:55.241]  Uh, downplaying it and saying we're going to go organic.
[02:41:55.241 --> 02:41:56.121]  It's a big thing.
[02:41:56.121 --> 02:41:58.382]  Burger King would be the other, but, yeah.
[02:41:58.382 --> 02:42:00.623]  Is that beard organic?
[02:42:00.623 --> 02:42:01.083]  I can't hear.
[02:42:01.083 --> 02:42:03.064]  Is that beard organic?
[02:42:03.064 --> 02:42:04.785]  Oh yeah, homegrown, all natural.
[02:42:04.785 --> 02:42:10.227]  Now you don't mean offense to Grizzly Adams with that beard, do you?
[02:42:10.227 --> 02:42:11.348]  I do not.
[02:42:11.348 --> 02:42:13.289]  I take my cap to Grizzly Adams.
[02:42:13.289 --> 02:42:13.809]  Me too.
[02:42:13.809 --> 02:42:15.250]  Everybody loves Grizzly Adams.
[02:42:16.218 --> 02:42:17.579]  And he did have a beard.
[02:42:17.579 --> 02:42:20.080]  He did have a beard.
[02:42:20.080 --> 02:42:20.820]  You're awesome.
[02:42:20.820 --> 02:42:23.822]  Hey, what do you think working at Infowars.com?
[02:42:23.822 --> 02:42:26.583]  It has been the best job that I have had.
[02:42:26.583 --> 02:42:29.144]  Now, we didn't plan or script this today, did we?
[02:42:29.144 --> 02:42:29.685]  No, no, no.
[02:42:29.685 --> 02:42:30.685]  Not at all.
[02:42:30.685 --> 02:42:36.088]  I'm actually kind of out of breath because I was running to get you some fresh new articles about McDonald's.
[02:42:36.088 --> 02:42:37.729]  Well, you guys are doing an incredible job.
[02:42:37.729 --> 02:42:39.109]  Thank you so much, Richard.
[02:42:39.109 --> 02:42:39.709]  Thank you.
[02:42:39.709 --> 02:42:43.371]  Do we want to get CJ to pop in?
[02:42:43.371 --> 02:42:44.132]  Hello.
[02:42:44.132 --> 02:42:44.472]  CJ here.
[02:42:45.140 --> 02:42:46.541]  Hello C.J.
[02:42:46.541 --> 02:42:46.821]  C.J.
[02:42:46.821 --> 02:42:48.442]  does an amazing job as well.
[02:42:48.442 --> 02:42:48.903]  C.J.
[02:42:48.903 --> 02:42:50.103]  just give us your take randomly.
[02:42:50.103 --> 02:42:51.965]  What do you think the top story is today?
[02:42:51.965 --> 02:42:55.467]  What are you most focused on?
[02:42:55.467 --> 02:43:01.591]  I think the most enticing thing was the story about Hillary using her own email account, but I don't think it'll make a bit of difference in the elections.
[02:43:01.591 --> 02:43:03.992]  Well it did make the head of the EPA have to step down.
[02:43:03.992 --> 02:43:05.293]  It is illegal.
[02:43:05.293 --> 02:43:06.414]  It's Hillary.
[02:43:06.414 --> 02:43:07.515]  That's royalty in this country.
[02:43:08.530 --> 02:43:11.152]  Yeah, in fact, are you going to ask me why I'm against women?
[02:43:11.152 --> 02:43:12.472]  Because obviously I'm against women.
[02:43:12.472 --> 02:43:19.457]  But I'm criticizing Her Lord and Highness, Majesties, Greatness, Supremus, whatever you call her.
[02:43:19.457 --> 02:43:20.257]  Your Majestiness.
[02:43:20.257 --> 02:43:29.283]  I'm trying to quote Han Solo when he's talking to Your Graciousness, Magnitudeness, Greatness, Love You, Princesses, Queeness, Your Majesties.
[02:43:31.738 --> 02:43:33.899]  What is it Han Solo said about Princess Leia?
[02:43:33.899 --> 02:43:40.003]  That she was a brat, or a... Well, I mean, he's sitting there talking to her, being sarcastic about her royalty.
[02:43:40.003 --> 02:43:40.604]  That's right.
[02:43:40.604 --> 02:43:44.306]  So I wanna ask why he's racist against white people.
[02:43:44.306 --> 02:43:47.328]  Alright, I'm gonna stop you and tell you.
[02:43:47.328 --> 02:43:51.310]  Just randomly, CJ, what do you think the most important thing is in the world?
[02:43:51.310 --> 02:43:54.092]  What is the secret to the universe?
[02:43:54.092 --> 02:43:57.034]  Um... Fertility.
[02:43:57.034 --> 02:43:58.495]  I agree.
[02:43:58.495 --> 02:43:59.876]  And is that beard homegrown?
[02:44:00.982 --> 02:44:02.547]  Or is it a toupee?
[02:44:02.547 --> 02:44:05.595]  No, it is heavily fertilized.
[02:44:05.595 --> 02:44:08.944]  You know, I always joke that my hair looks like a toupee, but it's not.
[02:44:09.887 --> 02:44:12.648]  So, I have hair so bad now that it's falling out.
[02:44:12.648 --> 02:44:20.089]  It's so thick where it still is growing, like halfway back on my head, that, that it looks like it's a toupee.
[02:44:20.089 --> 02:44:30.651]  So, I'm the only guy that could go join like a toupee cult, you know, where they have these big, giant, ugly toupees, uh, and it looks like a dead possum on my head, speaking of possum meals, and I could get away with it.
[02:44:30.651 --> 02:44:32.731]  I mean, this is not a toupee, is it, CJ?
[02:44:32.731 --> 02:44:34.391]  You didn't help apply... No, it's genuine.
[02:44:34.391 --> 02:44:36.352]  You didn't help apply the toupee tape earlier?
[02:44:36.352 --> 02:44:36.852]  No, no.
[02:44:36.852 --> 02:44:37.412]  Even though you did?
[02:44:38.192 --> 02:44:40.854]  Alex, it's just your brain growing.
[02:44:40.854 --> 02:44:42.956]  I do actually have a big German head.
[02:44:42.956 --> 02:44:44.477]  I guess from the German side of my family.
[02:44:44.477 --> 02:44:46.138]  I look like the German side of my family.
[02:44:46.138 --> 02:44:48.360]  Almost as big as Halbich's.
[02:44:48.360 --> 02:44:50.802]  But as you notice, Halbich has that big giant German head.
[02:44:50.802 --> 02:44:56.106]  Kind of like a Martian or something.
[02:44:56.106 --> 02:44:57.627]  I'm not putting down Halbich though.
[02:44:57.627 --> 02:44:59.068]  I bet he's laughing.
[02:44:59.068 --> 02:45:00.450]  I have a big head too.
[02:45:00.450 --> 02:45:02.371]  So see, I'm allowed to say it.
[02:45:02.371 --> 02:45:03.052]  Joe's got a big head.
[02:45:04.161 --> 02:45:07.302]  Joe does have a... Look at the size of that head!
[02:45:07.302 --> 02:45:08.843]  Has it's own weather systems!
[02:45:08.843 --> 02:45:10.263]  It's a five head.
[02:45:10.263 --> 02:45:16.326]  What Mike Myers movie is that where... He's a Scottish guy and the kids are... So I married an axe murderer.
[02:45:16.326 --> 02:45:18.566]  So I married an axe murderer.
[02:45:18.566 --> 02:45:20.647]  Can we pull up So I Married an Axe Murderer?
[02:45:20.647 --> 02:45:21.147]  Which one?
[02:45:21.147 --> 02:45:21.748]  Head!
[02:45:21.748 --> 02:45:23.268]  Look at the size of that head!
[02:45:23.268 --> 02:45:27.230]  Alright, now you're getting a behind the scenes of what goes on when we're in a pool hall.
[02:45:27.230 --> 02:45:29.250]  I'm gonna stop right now.
[02:45:29.250 --> 02:45:30.331]  I'm gonna quit right now.
[02:45:31.781 --> 02:45:33.382]  Stick to the news, Alex.
[02:45:33.382 --> 02:45:34.702]  Do what?
[02:45:34.702 --> 02:45:35.823]  Stick to the news.
[02:45:35.823 --> 02:45:36.703]  Alright.
[02:45:36.703 --> 02:45:43.666]  You guys need to, like, implant shock sensors in here, that when I get off covering serious news, it is gallows humor.
[02:45:43.666 --> 02:45:44.486]  I've said this before.
[02:45:44.486 --> 02:45:45.567]  I mean, I'm being honest, folks.
[02:45:45.567 --> 02:45:53.350]  I need to screw around a little bit sometimes, because this stuff gets to me, and... Alex, just shut it down.
[02:45:53.350 --> 02:45:56.891]  Oh, you're now giving a behind-the-scenes little secret.
[02:45:56.891 --> 02:46:00.753]  Jennings, tell people what that means.
[02:46:00.753 --> 02:46:01.393]  I plead the fifth.
[02:46:02.386 --> 02:46:05.567]  Well no, when I want to get the show going and people are blabbering, what do I say?
[02:46:05.567 --> 02:46:06.148]  Shut it down!
[02:46:06.148 --> 02:46:08.609]  Alright guys, shut it down.
[02:46:08.609 --> 02:46:10.269]  Let's focus.
[02:46:10.269 --> 02:46:13.731]  Yeah, and that's what my son says to me now whenever I'm acting silly or something.
[02:46:13.731 --> 02:46:16.732]  He goes, shut it down, shut it, do it for real.
[02:46:16.732 --> 02:46:17.833]  Shut it down!
[02:46:17.833 --> 02:46:18.793]  Shut it down!
[02:46:18.793 --> 02:46:19.433]  Shut it down!
[02:46:19.433 --> 02:46:21.174]  Of course, I rarely do it like that.
[02:46:21.174 --> 02:46:22.895]  I'm very nice.
[02:46:22.895 --> 02:46:26.717]  But you can tell me, in fact, the whole room, turn your mics on and scream.
[02:46:26.717 --> 02:46:28.297]  One, two, three.
[02:46:28.297 --> 02:46:28.698]  Shut it down!
[02:46:30.564 --> 02:46:32.206]  Shut it down, Jones!
[02:46:32.206 --> 02:46:32.586]  Focus!
[02:46:32.586 --> 02:46:35.169]  Alright, I'm gonna focus.
[02:46:35.169 --> 02:46:40.113]  We'll have to do overdrive to go to Jimmy and Ray and Jay and Chris and Mary.
[02:46:40.113 --> 02:46:41.154]  I really apologize.
[02:46:41.154 --> 02:46:44.277]  It was on serious subjects and it's wrong.
[02:46:44.277 --> 02:46:52.505]  Maybe I should do a whole special report on nations all over the world confessed to carrying out false flag terrorism, not theory, admitted fact.
[02:46:52.505 --> 02:46:53.366]  Yeah, let me do that right now.
[02:46:54.909 --> 02:46:56.949]  Let's just do a little bit of it now.
[02:46:56.949 --> 02:47:05.292]  There are many documented false flag attacks where a government carries out a terror attack and then falsely blames its enemies for political purposes.
[02:47:05.292 --> 02:47:15.134]  In the following 54 instances, officials, not servants, and the government which carried out the attack or seriously proposed the attack admit to it either orally or in writing.
[02:47:15.774 --> 02:47:25.459]  Number one, Japanese troops, this is just modern ones, set off a small explosion on a train track in 31 and falsely blame it on China in order to justify an invasion of Manchuria.
[02:47:25.459 --> 02:47:30.221]  This is known as the Mukden Incident or the Manchurian Incident.
[02:47:30.221 --> 02:47:36.204]  The Tokyo International Military Tribunal found several of the perpetrators in the plan, including
[02:47:37.895 --> 02:47:53.480]  Hashimoto, a high-ranking Japanese Army officer, have on various occasions admitted their part in the plot that have stated that the object of the incident was to afford an excuse for the occupation of the Manchuria, that's what started World War II, basically, led up to it, by the
[02:47:54.668 --> 02:47:56.589]  Army and it goes forward.
[02:47:56.589 --> 02:48:12.560]  Number two, a major with the Nazi SS admitted to the Nuremberg trials, that we have links to all this, that under orders from the chief of the Gestapo, he and some other Nazi operatives faked attacks on their own people and resources, which they blamed on the Poles to justify the invasion of Poland.
[02:48:12.560 --> 02:48:16.563]  That's called Operation Himmler, first launched in Gleiwitz.
[02:48:16.563 --> 02:48:17.383]  Look it up.
[02:48:17.383 --> 02:48:20.785]  Number three, just add a little smiblet to that little added tidbit.
[02:48:20.785 --> 02:48:24.068]  Number three, Nazi General Franz Halder
[02:48:25.209 --> 02:48:36.002]  Also testified at Nuremberg trials that Nazi leader Hermann Goering admitted to setting fire to the German Parliament building in 1933 and then falsely blamed communists for the arson.
[02:48:36.002 --> 02:48:38.925]  And that was classified because our own government didn't want that known for a while.
[02:48:38.925 --> 02:48:39.946]  It was declassified a few years ago.
[02:48:40.467 --> 02:48:41.268]  Number 4.
[02:48:41.268 --> 02:48:52.215]  Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev admitted in writing that Soviet Union's Red Army shelled the Russian village of Mananila in 1939 while blaming the attack on Finland.
[02:48:52.215 --> 02:48:59.240]  As a basis for launching the Winter War against Finland, Russian President Boris Yeltsin agreed that Russia had been the aggressor in the Winter War.
[02:48:59.240 --> 02:48:59.440]  Number 5.
[02:49:01.325 --> 02:49:14.415]  The Russian Parliament, current Russian President Putin and former Soviet leader Gorbachev admitted that Soviet leader Joseph Stalin ordered his secret police to execute 20,000 Polish army officers and civilians in 1940 and falsely blamed it on the Nazis.
[02:49:14.415 --> 02:49:20.080]  Number six, the British government admits that between 1946 and 1948 it bombed five ships carrying Jews.
[02:49:20.080 --> 02:49:21.181]  Did you hear that?
[02:49:21.181 --> 02:49:22.202]  That's Harry Truman, folks.
[02:49:23.852 --> 02:49:29.617]  So he gets awards from the Jewish Crips because he killed them.
[02:49:29.617 --> 02:49:42.588]  The British government admits that between 1946 and 1948 it bombed five ships carrying Jews to flee the Holocaust to seek safety in Palestine, set up a fake group called Defenders of Arab Palestine, and then had the pseudo group falsely claim responsibility for the bombings, and see this.
[02:49:43.903 --> 02:49:50.067]  Israel, number 7, admits that a 54-in-Israeli terrorist cell operated in Egypt, planted bombs in several buildings, including U.S.
[02:49:50.067 --> 02:49:53.670]  diplomatic facilities, then left behind evidence implicating Arabs as the culprits.
[02:49:53.670 --> 02:50:00.874]  One of the bombs had detonated prematurely, allowing the Egyptians to identify the bombers, and several of the Israelis later confessed.
[02:50:00.874 --> 02:50:02.896]  And then it links to all the mainstream news articles.
[02:50:02.896 --> 02:50:13.523]  Number 8, the CIA admits that it hired Iranians, 1950s, to pose as communists and stage bombings in Iran in order to turn the country against the democratically elected Prime Minister, Mohammad Mossadegh.
[02:50:13.943 --> 02:50:15.023]  You know, I'm only up to number nine.
[02:50:15.023 --> 02:50:18.404]  I think I'm just going to have to do this tomorrow or do a special report on it.
[02:50:32.335 --> 02:50:36.957]  And the problem was, when I read this this morning, there was a whole bunch of them that aren't in there.
[02:50:36.957 --> 02:50:47.480]  Like, the British have declassified that they created the IRA, led the IRA, and did all the violent stuff to discredit Sinn Féin, and peaceful stuff for Ireland.
[02:50:47.480 --> 02:50:51.081]  And we know the names of the agents in the BBC, they were the ones that would do it.
[02:50:51.081 --> 02:50:52.962]  They would kneecap or kill people.
[02:50:52.962 --> 02:50:54.442]  They wouldn't carry out the bombings for them.
[02:50:54.442 --> 02:50:56.183]  It was all run by British commandos.
[02:50:56.183 --> 02:50:56.623]  Stay with us.
[02:50:59.202 --> 02:51:00.583]  You know about RVs.
[02:51:00.583 --> 02:51:02.044]  You've heard about bunkers.
[02:51:02.044 --> 02:51:04.806]  But surviving is not recreation.
[02:51:04.806 --> 02:51:07.568]  And man wasn't made to live underground.

[02:54:23.419 --> 02:54:24.360]  Really great news.
[02:54:24.360 --> 02:54:26.181]  You can read the article on Infowars.com.
[02:54:26.181 --> 02:54:28.783]  I mentioned it earlier, but I don't have time to read all the quotes.
[02:54:28.783 --> 02:54:31.946]  From Police 1, the other big police websites, it's just 98%.
[02:54:31.946 --> 02:54:35.248]  I mean, there's almost no one on there.
[02:54:35.248 --> 02:54:38.771]  The articles, the writers, the police, the people tweeting back.
[02:54:38.771 --> 02:54:39.952]  Basically, almost no one.
[02:54:39.952 --> 02:54:43.595]  I mean, I say 98% because I was on there today, not just reading our article.
[02:54:43.595 --> 02:54:48.459]  I can't find anybody out there supporting banning these 2-2-3 rounds because they could kill a cop.
[02:54:48.459 --> 02:54:49.560]  I mean, any bullet can
[02:54:50.643 --> 02:54:55.608]  Basically kill a cop and a lot of bullets can shoot through body armor, that's just the way it is.
[02:54:55.608 --> 02:54:58.971]  So they see what's going on, that's certainly good news.
[02:54:58.971 --> 02:55:11.262]  Before I go to your calls in this segment, and a little bit of overdrive, the biggest sleeper we've got here at Infowarslife.com, and it supports the broadcast, is OxyPowder.
[02:55:11.262 --> 02:55:14.546]  And the reason I'm plugging it now is I was talking about doing another OxyPowder cleanse.
[02:55:15.590 --> 02:55:16.271]  I don't know.
[02:55:30.066 --> 02:55:32.128]  The rest of your immune system kicks in.
[02:55:32.128 --> 02:55:33.209]  It's so incredibly healthy.
[02:55:33.209 --> 02:55:35.370]  It's so gentle, but powerful.
[02:55:35.370 --> 02:55:36.511]  You've heard the rave reviews.
[02:55:36.511 --> 02:55:37.332]  This is not a game.
[02:55:37.332 --> 02:55:42.216]  This is time-delayed, higher-level oxygen, like ozone, basically.
[02:55:42.216 --> 02:55:43.297]  It breaks down.
[02:55:43.297 --> 02:55:48.201]  Time releases in your guts, and just you wouldn't believe the garbage that's in there, the literal you-know-what.
[02:55:49.065 --> 02:55:55.188]  So Infowarslife.com, discounted, lowest price on oxy powder put out by Dr. Group.
[02:55:55.188 --> 02:55:58.829]  Folks in Hollywood take this to go down dress sizes or pant sizes.
[02:55:58.829 --> 02:56:04.172]  And it's synergistically been key to my health and my weight loss and everything else I've done.
[02:56:04.172 --> 02:56:07.633]  And your purchase at Infowarslife.com makes everything possible or 888-253-3139.
[02:56:11.815 --> 02:56:14.936]  And all the pro-gun, pro-liberty apparel made in America.
[02:56:14.936 --> 02:56:18.898]  It's made in 1776.com or InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:56:18.898 --> 02:56:20.439]  That's the big umbrella site.
[02:56:20.439 --> 02:56:22.500]  If you want high-quality, longevity products...
[02:56:23.530 --> 02:56:35.154]  I'm always plugging this and not mentioning, you get free shipping when you sign up for AutoShip and you get 30% off when you don't just go to the site and buy when you go and sign up to be a distributor.
[02:56:35.154 --> 02:56:36.914]  That just means you can buy it in bulk.
[02:56:36.914 --> 02:56:40.395]  You get 30% off and free shipping.
[02:56:40.395 --> 02:56:49.458]  Takes about a minute to do at InfoWarsHealth.com for all the great longevity products like Beyond Tangy Tangerine, Pollen Burst,
[02:56:49.978 --> 02:56:50.978]  Going back to his false flag.
[02:57:15.399 --> 02:57:21.987]  As terrible as the story that Sandy Hook was, I think that 9-11 dwarfs it.
[02:57:21.987 --> 02:57:23.689]  Thousands of people were killed.
[02:57:23.689 --> 02:57:25.992]  It changed our way of life.
[02:57:25.992 --> 02:57:31.138]  And if anyone doesn't see that 9-11 was an inside job, you're stupid.
[02:57:31.138 --> 02:57:31.839]  I'm sorry, but...
[02:57:32.421 --> 02:57:35.202]  Well, I mean, inside job doesn't mean the government itself.
[02:57:35.202 --> 02:57:36.282]  All the government ran it.
[02:57:36.282 --> 02:57:38.943]  It just means criminal elements did allow it to happen, bare minimum.
[02:57:38.943 --> 02:57:39.763]  It is an inside job.
[02:57:39.763 --> 02:57:40.523]  We've been proven correct.
[02:57:40.523 --> 02:57:41.644]  You're absolutely right.
[02:57:41.644 --> 02:57:47.586]  And somebody blew up Building 7 and told BBC and CNN it had already fallen before it fell.
[02:57:47.586 --> 02:57:48.346]  Exactly.
[02:57:48.346 --> 02:57:51.567]  Tower 7 is a smoking gun high.
[02:57:51.567 --> 02:57:53.707]  It is the enchiladas of enchiladas.
[02:57:53.707 --> 02:57:55.428]  The trillion pound enchilada.
[02:57:55.428 --> 02:57:56.448]  The Big Kahuna.
[02:57:56.448 --> 02:57:57.568]  The Mac Daddy.
[02:57:57.568 --> 02:57:58.949]  The one that brings them all down.
[02:58:00.205 --> 02:58:03.006]  And I interviewed the emergency manager and they killed him two weeks later.
[02:58:03.006 --> 02:58:05.587]  He said, yeah, they said, get out, they're going to blow the building up.
[02:58:05.587 --> 02:58:06.987]  And they killed him better than a hammer.
[02:58:06.987 --> 02:58:08.567]  Which is for talking to us.
[02:58:08.567 --> 02:58:09.428]  It's not a game, folks.
[02:58:09.428 --> 02:58:11.468]  I mean, I deal with death every day.
[02:58:11.468 --> 02:58:12.829]  The angel of death flapping around.
[02:58:12.829 --> 02:58:15.489]  That's only Christ angels.
[02:58:15.489 --> 02:58:17.630]  God's angels is the reason I'm alive.
[02:58:17.630 --> 02:58:18.630]  God puts up with me.
[02:58:18.630 --> 02:58:20.831]  Lord knows I'm obnoxious and I appreciate you, Jimmy, but...
[02:58:21.511 --> 02:58:30.434]  Yeah, I just am so humbled by everybody and by God, and by the fact that we're here doing this, because we are the biggest, meanest thing in the face of the enemy, and we're pretty small.
[02:58:30.434 --> 02:58:32.695]  But through Christ, we can do anything.
[02:58:32.695 --> 02:58:33.635]  Overdrive's coming up.
[02:58:33.635 --> 02:58:34.475]  Infowars.com.
[02:58:34.475 --> 02:58:35.896]  For its last show, we're still live.
[02:58:35.896 --> 02:58:36.636]  Stay with us.
[02:58:36.636 --> 02:58:37.696]  Mary, you're straight up.
[02:58:37.696 --> 02:58:41.578]  Next.
[02:58:41.578 --> 02:58:45.539]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[02:58:48.996 --> 02:58:52.659]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[02:58:52.659 --> 02:58:56.922]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[02:58:56.922 --> 02:58:58.703]  Can you put two and two together?
[02:58:58.703 --> 02:59:06.569]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[02:59:06.569 --> 02:59:07.710]  But for how long?
[02:59:07.710 --> 02:59:14.355]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com, spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[02:59:14.355 --> 02:59:17.177]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[02:59:18.496 --> 02:59:21.998]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[02:59:21.998 --> 02:59:30.243]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[02:59:30.243 --> 02:59:35.666]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[02:59:35.666 --> 02:59:38.188]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[02:59:38.188 --> 02:59:40.309]  We now have the synergistic solution.

[02:59:50.865 --> 03:00:00.157]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:00.157 --> 03:00:05.584]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:05.584 --> 03:00:07.867]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[03:00:23.434 --> 03:00:26.015]  Final segment, the customary little overdrive.
[03:00:26.015 --> 03:00:34.501]  Kind of like that little piece of meat that dangles off the, uh, porterhouse steak.
[03:00:34.501 --> 03:00:36.222]  Let's go to Mary in New Jersey.
[03:00:36.222 --> 03:00:36.862]  You're on the air.
[03:00:36.862 --> 03:00:39.484]  Hi, Alex.
[03:00:39.484 --> 03:00:42.726]  I'd like to make two points about Sandy Hook shooting.
[03:00:42.726 --> 03:00:43.667]  Sure, go ahead.
[03:00:43.667 --> 03:00:45.408]  Also, thank God for you.
[03:00:46.226 --> 03:00:47.707]  Thank God for you.
[03:00:47.707 --> 03:01:04.922]  And Sandy Hook, I want to say that all these different videos that were made, one of the videos that I looked at, because I read all the stuff at first, too, somebody said they were sent records anonymously by a school board about
[03:01:06.289 --> 03:01:10.310]  The school being closed for something like four years because it was condemned.
[03:01:10.310 --> 03:01:12.150]  Oh yeah, it had been closed before.
[03:01:12.150 --> 03:01:13.311]  We've confirmed that.
[03:01:13.311 --> 03:01:14.491]  That's why they're so scared.
[03:01:14.491 --> 03:01:20.432]  I mean, they act really scared to give anything out on this.
[03:01:20.432 --> 03:01:24.513]  The second point I wanted to make, I am a nurse.
[03:01:24.513 --> 03:01:26.013]  I was a nurse for 40 years.
[03:01:26.013 --> 03:01:28.934]  ICU, taught BLS.
[03:01:28.934 --> 03:01:32.735]  Nobody that was injured was taken to the hospital and pronounced
[03:01:33.567 --> 03:01:35.589]  Dead by anyone.
[03:01:35.589 --> 03:01:36.089]  Dead, dead.
[03:01:51.877 --> 03:01:55.600]  People have to be pronounced dead by an MD, by a doctor.
[03:01:55.600 --> 03:01:58.863]  They cannot just close up the school.
[03:01:58.863 --> 03:02:00.825]  They have to be taken in.
[03:02:00.825 --> 03:02:08.972]  Any death of anybody taken to a hospital within 24 hours is a coroner's case.
[03:02:08.972 --> 03:02:19.481]  And if there's any foul play involved, the medical doctor can pronounce dead, but then cause of death is by the coroner, under law, and you've got to have the medical exam or people go to jail.
[03:02:20.566 --> 03:02:21.267]  That's right.
[03:02:21.267 --> 03:02:29.460]  There would be a big investigation and none of the hospitals reported any people coming to any hospital.
[03:02:29.460 --> 03:02:32.204]  The police can't just decide they're dead and close up the...
[03:02:33.459 --> 03:02:34.319]  God bless you, man.
[03:02:34.319 --> 03:02:35.259]  Tell that story.
[03:02:35.259 --> 03:02:36.180]  People listen to a nurse.
[03:02:36.180 --> 03:02:38.060]  I mean, my dad's been a physician.
[03:02:38.060 --> 03:02:39.220]  I've worked in and around hospitals.
[03:02:39.220 --> 03:02:40.321]  I know the rules of law.
[03:02:40.321 --> 03:02:44.022]  It's just the whole thing is really suspicious.
[03:02:44.022 --> 03:02:45.502]  They're covering something up big time.
[03:02:45.502 --> 03:02:48.443]  Eileen in California at KOMY, 1340 AM.
[03:02:48.443 --> 03:02:51.944]  Listener, go ahead.
[03:02:51.944 --> 03:02:57.025]  Oh, Alex, thank you so much, my brother, for you and your crew.
[03:02:57.025 --> 03:02:58.165]  You guys are awesome.
[03:02:58.165 --> 03:02:58.746]  Please, no, no.
[03:02:58.746 --> 03:02:59.626]  We're in it all together.
[03:02:59.626 --> 03:03:00.066]  Thank you.
[03:03:00.066 --> 03:03:00.306]  Go ahead.
[03:03:01.407 --> 03:03:09.714]  You're all in our prayers, and I would like to ask you if you would like to eliminate being called a conspiracy theorist.
[03:03:09.714 --> 03:03:12.417]  Yeah, I mean, it's a label to say don't listen to these people.
[03:03:12.417 --> 03:03:14.518]  It's something they do.
[03:03:14.518 --> 03:03:20.503]  I mean, I'm a person that questions known liars, but there are people out there that just make stuff up.
[03:03:20.503 --> 03:03:23.126]  You call them conspiracy theorists, but it's been declassified.
[03:03:23.126 --> 03:03:24.687]  It's a CIA term.
[03:03:24.687 --> 03:03:29.091]  The Clintons ordered the media in 93 to use it to demonize anybody that opposed them.
[03:03:30.233 --> 03:03:34.494]  That came out of the Clinton Library six months ago.
[03:03:34.494 --> 03:03:35.034]  Exactly.
[03:03:35.034 --> 03:03:57.119]  So, I believe that God's given me a proprietary, well, more than one proprietary idea to be able to turn this around and be able to take the accusations of us being conspiracy theorists, labeling us in a derogatory way that we're just something out of our minds.
[03:03:59.150 --> 03:04:00.031]  So, what's your idea?
[03:04:00.031 --> 03:04:01.971]  What do we do?
[03:04:01.971 --> 03:04:06.053]  Well, it's proprietary, so I want to know how I can get it into your hands.
[03:04:06.053 --> 03:04:09.994]  Can I meet you at CalJam, or are you going to be coming to Santa Cruz?
[03:04:09.994 --> 03:04:12.755]  I am intending to go to CalJam.
[03:04:12.755 --> 03:04:20.338]  I do want to go soon to speak again there at MZ Stations that you're listening on.
[03:04:20.338 --> 03:04:20.958]  I've got to jump.
[03:04:20.958 --> 03:04:22.719]  Thank you so much for the call.
[03:04:22.719 --> 03:04:26.340]  My problem is I get sent so many great ideas that I can't implement one-tenth of them.
[03:04:27.162 --> 03:04:28.824]  Or not even 1-10th, more like 1-100th.
[03:04:28.824 --> 03:04:29.685]  So I feel bad.
[03:04:29.685 --> 03:04:31.628]  People send me stuff or ideas.
[03:04:31.628 --> 03:04:36.174]  I don't do anything with it because I'm so busy and so exhausted half the time.
[03:04:36.174 --> 03:04:38.377]  Then people think that I'm not caring.
[03:04:38.377 --> 03:04:40.320]  It's not pearls before swine.
[03:04:40.320 --> 03:04:43.184]  Well, I am kind of a pig-like creature, but it's pearls before...
[03:04:44.045 --> 03:04:45.587]  Somebody that can't pick them all up.
[03:04:45.587 --> 03:04:46.808]  I've been given so many pearls.
[03:04:46.808 --> 03:04:50.191]  I'm like, mountains of them, avalanches of them have crushed me.
[03:04:50.191 --> 03:04:52.213]  That's why don't wait for me to help you out.
[03:04:52.213 --> 03:04:54.895]  Get out there and bring it to market yourself.
[03:04:54.895 --> 03:04:55.856]  Great job to the crew.
[03:04:55.856 --> 03:04:57.718]  Nightly News coming up tonight, 7 o'clock Central.
