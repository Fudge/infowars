[00:00:19.642 --> 00:00:21.664]  Welcome to the Info Wars Nightly News.
[00:00:21.764 --> 00:00:23.065]  I'm your host, Jakari Jackson.
[00:00:23.445 --> 00:00:26.927]  On this December 25th, 2015 edition, Christmas Day.
[00:00:27.007 --> 00:00:32.051]  We are not at all afraid of the political correctness, and we will call Christmas Day exactly what it is.
[00:00:32.471 --> 00:00:36.955]  And on this broadcast, we have many great special reports for you, many of them holiday themed.
[00:00:37.075 --> 00:00:45.861]  One in particular is David Knight's It's a Wonderful Life, a story about the Federal Reserve and how they've been bilking you out of your money for many, many years.
[00:00:46.202 --> 00:00:47.783]  Now, an interesting thing about this report
[00:00:48.203 --> 00:00:48.723]  We're good to go.
[00:01:11.477 --> 00:01:13.679]  InfoWars Christmas tree red, white and blue.
[00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:15.641]  They say they don't want you to have red, white and blue.
[00:01:15.681 --> 00:01:18.043]  They say it's discriminatory and it's this and that.
[00:01:18.063 --> 00:01:19.505]  I don't agree with that at all.
[00:01:19.825 --> 00:01:23.168]  So we're going to show it to you all here proper on the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:01:23.489 --> 00:01:25.551]  Hope you enjoy the rest of your evening with your family.
[00:01:30.216 --> 00:01:31.597]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[00:01:31.877 --> 00:01:33.158]  You can't survive without it.
[00:01:33.358 --> 00:01:34.258]  But where do you get it?
[00:01:34.558 --> 00:01:40.322]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new, groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.
[00:01:40.542 --> 00:01:46.265]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.
[00:01:46.465 --> 00:02:03.329]  Pairing the unprecedented superfiltration power of an all-new Gravity Block Core with a hybrid chromatic shell, it removes up to 99.999% of impurities, including bacteria, viruses, fluoride, disinfectants, volatile organic contaminants, and hormones.
[00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:05.850]  Filter capacity up to 5,000 gallons.
[00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:07.390]  Stainless steel construction.

[00:02:08.711 --> 00:02:09.331]  Low maintenance.
[00:02:09.631 --> 00:02:11.452]  Replacement filters are simple to install.

[00:02:42.028 --> 00:02:49.972]  Over the last 100 years, the Federal Reserve has created bubbles and burst them, enslaved us with debt, and destroyed our purchasing power through inflation.
[00:02:50.812 --> 00:02:53.934]  Yes, it's been a wonderful lie for the bankers.
[00:02:54.574 --> 00:03:01.758]  There are striking parallels in Frank Capra's It's a Wonderful Life to the lies and tricks that real bankers used to create the Federal Reserve.
[00:03:02.258 --> 00:03:09.982]  Human nature doesn't change, and the greedy elite of 1913 and 2013 look and act a lot like Potter, the banker in the movie.
[00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:18.144]  And many Americans are left like George Bailey, staring into the abyss as their dreams collapse and they face financial ruin.
[00:03:18.464 --> 00:03:21.666]  Do we live in a country that looks a lot more like Pottersville than Bedford Falls?
[00:03:22.066 --> 00:03:26.449]  What does Frank Capra's film show us about how we got here and how we can get out?
[00:03:27.189 --> 00:03:35.234]  When the Federal Reserve was created two days before Christmas 100 years ago, it was a culmination of six years of fraud, fear, and manipulation.
[00:03:35.654 --> 00:03:38.736]  I've never really seen one, but that's got all the earmarks of being a run.
[00:03:40.057 --> 00:03:43.620]  The panic of 1907 was used to shape public support for the Fed.
[00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:49.063]  The panic was triggered by rumors that two major banks were about to become insolvent, just as we see in the movie.
[00:03:49.384 --> 00:03:53.527]  George, there is a rumor around town that you've closed your doors.
[00:03:53.587 --> 00:03:54.407]  Is that true?
[00:03:54.427 --> 00:03:58.170]  I am going all out to help in this crisis.
[00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:03.394]  I have just guaranteed the banks sufficient funds to meet their needs.
[00:04:04.234 --> 00:04:07.156]  They'll close up for a week and then reopen.
[00:04:08.437 --> 00:04:09.298]  Just took over the bank.
[00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:15.533]  I may lose a fortune, but I am willing to guarantee your people, too.
[00:04:16.133 --> 00:04:20.996]  Just tell them to bring their shares over here, and I will pay 50 cents on the dollar.
[00:04:21.397 --> 00:04:23.198]  Oh, you never miss a trick, do you, Potter?
[00:04:23.698 --> 00:04:24.859]  Unfortunately, J.P.
[00:04:24.899 --> 00:04:30.823]  Morgan got away with the deception, and was able to shut down competitors and snapped up assets at fire cell prices.
[00:04:31.103 --> 00:04:33.725]  Now, take during the Depression, for instance.
[00:04:34.366 --> 00:04:36.787]  You and I were the only ones that kept our heads.
[00:04:37.508 --> 00:04:38.829]  You saved a billion long,
[00:04:39.841 --> 00:04:40.862]  I saved all the rest.
[00:04:41.522 --> 00:04:44.024]  Yes, well, most people say you stole all the rest.
[00:04:44.044 --> 00:04:46.185]  The envious ones say that, George.
[00:04:46.245 --> 00:04:47.105]  The suckers!
[00:04:47.386 --> 00:04:48.546]  Charles Lindbergh Sr.
[00:04:48.606 --> 00:04:56.611]  warned people at the time of the creation of the Federal Reserve that it would not stop boom and bust cycles, but would actually create them in order to benefit its private owners.
[00:04:56.971 --> 00:04:57.712]  Here's what he said.
[00:04:58.362 --> 00:05:06.391]  To cause high prices, all the Federal Reserve Board will do will be to lower the re-discount rate, producing an expansion of credit and a rising stock market.
[00:05:06.691 --> 00:05:12.818]  Then, when businessmen are adjusted to these conditions, it can check prosperity in mid-career by arbitrarily raising the rate of interest.
[00:05:13.158 --> 00:05:20.306]  It can cause a pendulum of a rising and falling market to swing gently back and forth, or cause violent fluctuations by greater rate variation.
[00:05:21.132 --> 00:05:28.514]  And in either case, it will possess inside information as to the financial conditions and advanced knowledge of the coming change, either up or down.
[00:05:29.294 --> 00:05:36.196]  This is the strangest, most dangerous advantage ever placed in the hands of a special privileged class by any government that ever existed.
[00:05:36.717 --> 00:05:42.878]  The system is private, conducted for the sole purpose of obtaining the greatest possible profits from the use of other people's money.
[00:05:43.259 --> 00:05:47.600]  They know in advance when to create panics to their advantage, and they know when to stop panic.
[00:05:48.499 --> 00:05:53.126]  Inflation and deflation work equally well for them when they control the finance.
[00:05:53.747 --> 00:05:58.093]  As we see in the movie, not all lending institutions have the same motivations.
[00:05:59.015 --> 00:06:01.819]  Now you take this loan here, the Ernie Bishop.
[00:06:02.429 --> 00:06:08.091]  You know, that fellow that sits around all day on his brains in his taxi, you know?
[00:06:08.751 --> 00:06:11.992]  I happen to know the bank turned down this loan.
[00:06:12.052 --> 00:06:16.754]  But he comes here, and we're building him a house worth $5,000!
[00:06:17.454 --> 00:06:17.994]  Why?
[00:06:18.054 --> 00:06:21.615]  Well, I handled that, Mr. Potter.
[00:06:21.935 --> 00:06:24.416]  You have all the papers there, his salary, insurance.
[00:06:24.496 --> 00:06:25.996]  I can personally vouch for his character.
[00:06:26.237 --> 00:06:26.817]  Friend of yours?
[00:06:27.137 --> 00:06:27.437]  Yes, sir.
[00:06:28.203 --> 00:06:28.483]  Uh-huh.
[00:06:28.923 --> 00:06:33.965]  You see, if you shoot pool with some employee here, you can come and borrow money.
[00:06:35.145 --> 00:06:36.465]  What does that get us?
[00:06:36.825 --> 00:06:41.827]  A discontented, lazy rabble instead of a thrifty working class.
[00:06:42.227 --> 00:06:49.649]  As a former FDIC chair said, all too often the large banks use their models and their algorithms, and if you don't fit in their boxes, you don't get the loan.
[00:06:50.249 --> 00:06:55.555]  And Dodd-Frank legislation is tying the hands of small lenders, shutting out buyers, and shutting down lenders.
[00:06:55.875 --> 00:07:00.020]  Today, there are fewer lenders than at any time the government has kept records.
[00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:01.501]  10,000 banks disappeared between 1984 and 2011.
[00:07:01.641 --> 00:07:09.790]  This town needs this measly one-horse institution, if only to have some place where people can come without crawling the potter.
[00:07:11.713 --> 00:07:17.896]  In the movie, George gets to see what happens to the small town if Potter didn't have competition from credit unions and smaller lenders.
[00:07:18.436 --> 00:07:22.438]  If it hadn't been for you... Yeah, if it hadn't been for me, everybody would be a lot better off.
[00:07:22.478 --> 00:07:27.660]  My wife and my kids and my friends... Look, little fella, why don't you go off and haunt somebody else?
[00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:32.182]  Yeah, so you still think killing yourself would make everyone feel happier, eh?
[00:07:34.203 --> 00:07:35.084]  Well, I don't know.
[00:07:35.104 --> 00:07:35.904]  I guess you're right.
[00:07:38.283 --> 00:07:40.445]  It's both been better if I'd never been born at all.
[00:07:40.765 --> 00:07:43.768]  Pottersville, the only businesses thriving, are vice.
[00:07:44.289 --> 00:07:44.989]  People are angry.
[00:07:45.490 --> 00:07:48.673]  The town is filled with signs like, keep moving, keep off the grass.
[00:07:49.393 --> 00:07:53.878]  Bert the cop actually shoots at George when he's running away, and is no threat to anyone.
[00:07:54.558 --> 00:08:00.323]  Stand back!
[00:08:00.664 --> 00:08:02.866]  Everyone is a renter, no one has a stake.
[00:08:03.559 --> 00:08:06.421]  Now, you're Arnie Bishop and you live in Bailey Park with your wife and kid.
[00:08:06.501 --> 00:08:07.742]  Look, bud, what's the idea?
[00:08:07.822 --> 00:08:09.364]  I live in a shack in Pottersville.
[00:08:09.384 --> 00:08:13.267]  My wife ran away three years ago and took the kid and I ain't never seen you before in my life, see?
[00:08:13.507 --> 00:08:17.950]  Private property and everyone having a stake is the antidote to Pottersville.
[00:08:18.410 --> 00:08:19.912]  Here, you're all businessmen here.
[00:08:19.952 --> 00:08:22.694]  Doesn't make them better citizens, doesn't make them better customers.
[00:08:22.974 --> 00:08:29.559]  But whether it's the Trans-Pacific Partnership or a global carbon tax, the global elite don't see you as a stakeholder.
[00:08:29.779 --> 00:08:33.202]  They want to turn us all into serfs and treat us like cattle.
[00:08:33.542 --> 00:08:40.349]  Just remember this, Mr. Potter, that this rabble you're talking about, they do most of the working and paying and living and dying in this community.
[00:08:41.029 --> 00:08:44.793]  Well, is it too much to have them work and pay and live and die in a couple of decent rooms and a bath?
[00:08:45.474 --> 00:08:47.075]  Anyway, my father didn't think so.
[00:08:48.236 --> 00:08:52.701]  People were human beings to him, but to you, a warped, frustrated old man, they're cattle.
[00:08:53.638 --> 00:08:56.060]  Well, in my book, he died a much richer man than you'll ever be.
[00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:57.741]  I'm not interested in your book.
[00:08:57.841 --> 00:09:00.363]  I'm talking about the building and loan.
[00:09:00.643 --> 00:09:02.344]  I know very well what you're talking about.
[00:09:02.364 --> 00:09:04.506]  You're talking about something you can't get your fingers on.
[00:09:04.946 --> 00:09:09.749]  Speaking of riches, do you find the salary amounts amusing when Potter tries to buy George off?
[00:09:09.909 --> 00:09:11.070]  Let's look at your side.
[00:09:12.831 --> 00:09:13.472]  Young man, 27, 28.
[00:09:13.532 --> 00:09:15.773]  Married, making, say, 40 a week.
[00:09:15.793 --> 00:09:15.773]  45. 45.
[00:09:21.744 --> 00:09:22.464]  Forty-five.
[00:09:22.984 --> 00:09:34.007]  George, I'll start you out at $20,000 a year.
[00:09:34.027 --> 00:09:34.407]  $20,000 a year?
[00:09:35.148 --> 00:09:37.948]  You wouldn't mind living in the nicest house in town?
[00:09:38.528 --> 00:09:40.529]  Buying your wife a lot of fine clothes?
[00:09:40.549 --> 00:09:43.690]  A couple of business trips to New York a year?
[00:09:44.030 --> 00:09:45.570]  Maybe once in a while Europe?
[00:09:45.950 --> 00:09:47.331]  You wouldn't mind that, would you, Jones?
[00:09:47.591 --> 00:09:47.991]  Would I?
[00:09:48.806 --> 00:09:54.692]  Even if George had saved a lot of his $20,000 salary, would it have bought much a couple of decades later?
[00:09:55.112 --> 00:10:03.461]  By even the government's very conservative estimate of inflation, the dollar has lost 90% of its value since 1947, when the movie was made.
[00:10:03.841 --> 00:10:09.427]  The Fed's deliberate inflation is devastating to anyone trying to accumulate wealth through hard work and saving.
[00:10:10.007 --> 00:10:17.213]  So what is the answer to all the George Baileys out there a hundred years after the government gave control of our money supply to private bankers like Potter?
[00:10:17.574 --> 00:10:20.136]  Well, Potter had more money than he could spend.
[00:10:20.376 --> 00:10:22.598]  But would any of you want to be Potter?
[00:10:22.999 --> 00:10:27.823]  You sit around here and you spin your little webs and you think the whole world revolves around you and your money.
[00:10:27.843 --> 00:10:28.964]  Well it doesn't, Mr. Potter!
[00:10:29.725 --> 00:10:35.312]  In the whole vast configuration of things, I'd say you were nothing but a scurvy little spider.
[00:10:35.813 --> 00:10:42.582]  George Bailey finally sees how rich his own life is, as he sees the fruits of relationship, honesty, and compassion.
[00:10:47.206 --> 00:10:48.587]  Happy New Year to you!
[00:10:49.008 --> 00:10:49.848]  In jail!
[00:10:49.948 --> 00:10:51.970]  Go on home, they're waiting for you!
[00:10:52.070 --> 00:11:00.376]  And if the public can awaken to the lies of the Federal Reserve, if it could even be audited... Well, hello, Mr. Bank Examiner!
[00:11:00.616 --> 00:11:03.818]  It would be a huge step to breaking the chains that enslave all of us.
[00:11:04.198 --> 00:11:07.921]  But ultimately, it is God that changes minds and changes hearts.
[00:11:08.321 --> 00:11:09.442]  God hates oppression.
[00:11:09.862 --> 00:11:13.445]  And we can, and should, confidently pray that he will stop it.
[00:11:14.285 --> 00:11:16.347]  I owe everything to George Bailey.
[00:11:17.333 --> 00:11:18.833]  Help him, dear father.
[00:11:19.754 --> 00:11:22.154]  Joseph, Jesus, and Mary.
[00:11:22.954 --> 00:11:24.855]  Help my friend, Mr. Bailey.
[00:11:25.915 --> 00:11:28.296]  Help my son, George, tonight.
[00:11:29.176 --> 00:11:30.877]  He never thinks about himself, God.
[00:11:30.897 --> 00:11:31.977]  That's why he's in trouble.
[00:11:32.837 --> 00:11:33.937]  George is a good guy.
[00:11:35.278 --> 00:11:36.338]  Give him a break, God.
[00:11:37.478 --> 00:11:38.398]  I love him, dear Lord.
[00:11:38.899 --> 00:11:39.919]  Watch over him tonight.
[00:11:41.299 --> 00:11:42.059]  Please, God.
[00:11:42.519 --> 00:11:44.160]  Something's the matter with Daddy.
[00:11:45.054 --> 00:11:48.217]  Please bring Daddy back.
[00:11:48.357 --> 00:12:04.933]  Dear Father in Heaven, I'm not a praying man, but if you're up there and you can hear me, show me the way.
[00:12:05.273 --> 00:12:10.298]  For the InfoWars Nightly News, I'm David Knight.
[00:12:22.881 --> 00:12:34.787]  It's that time of the year again, the time of the year when the Department of Homeland Security and the fear factory in Washington DC doles out things like credible threats and a tweaking of the terror alert system.
[00:12:34.927 --> 00:12:41.831]  Most Americans are taking it very seriously this year as President Obama and the traitors occupying the nation's capital
[00:12:41.991 --> 00:12:42.371]  I don't know.
[00:13:03.027 --> 00:13:10.291]  Figures for November show that the FBI carried out some 2.2 million background checks on potential sales of guns.
[00:13:10.511 --> 00:13:19.777]  The figure constitutes a 24% increase on figures recorded this time last year, and is the 7th consecutive month to see a record number of checks.
[00:13:20.177 --> 00:13:24.099]  As we previously noted, on Black Friday, a record 185,345 background checks were processed by the FBI.
[00:13:29.522 --> 00:13:36.630]  In October, the FBI carried out 1,976,759 instant background checks.
[00:13:36.871 --> 00:13:44.860]  While the figures don't represent a one-to-one calculation for gun sales, they are considered a reliable indicator of overall gun sales.
[00:13:45.060 --> 00:13:48.845]  Sales between private parties are not subject to background checks.
[00:13:49.145 --> 00:13:54.827]  FBI stats also show that almost 20 million firearm-related checks have been carried out in 2015.
[00:13:55.647 --> 00:14:04.730]  With one month still to be calculated, the overall figure should surpass 2013's record of 21,009,273 checks.
[00:14:05.090 --> 00:14:08.672]  Gun sales and concealed carry permit applications in the U.S.
[00:14:08.712 --> 00:14:15.474]  have continued to spike in the days following the terror attacks in Paris and San Bernardino, according to gun store owners.
[00:14:15.774 --> 00:14:20.278]  Eric Wallace, manager of Adventure Outdoors in Smyrna, Georgia, told Today.
[00:14:20.718 --> 00:14:29.947]  Ever since the Paris attacks, we've had a lot of customers coming in buying, you know, first guns, buying guns to protect their homes, their families, and themselves.
[00:14:30.087 --> 00:14:37.173]  Like any good husband, ask for the list of Christmas items that you'd like to have, and one of the items was a firearm.
[00:14:37.433 --> 00:14:46.260]  In addition to the terrorist threat, President Obama has not tried to hide the fact that he intends to introduce gun control legislation via executive fiat.
[00:14:46.420 --> 00:14:49.622]  There can be no doubt that this is driving higher gun sales.
[00:14:50.002 --> 00:15:03.372]  Last week, White House Communications Director Jen Psaki told Bloomberg that within a matter of weeks, not months, Obama will review recommendations for executive orders provided to him at request by the Department of Justice.
[00:15:03.732 --> 00:15:06.840]  I believe in people's lawful right to bear arms.
[00:15:07.822 --> 00:15:09.607]  I will not take your shotgun away.
[00:15:10.128 --> 00:15:11.812]  I will not take your rifle away.
[00:15:13.553 --> 00:15:14.994]  I won't take your handgun away!
[00:15:15.234 --> 00:15:25.082]  The DOJ continues to work on options to allow Obama to skirt around Congress on the issue, and effectively counter lawsuits that pro-Second Amendment rights groups have prepared.
[00:15:25.382 --> 00:15:41.614]  According to Psaki, Obama is planning a range of steps that can be taken as it relates to the people who have access to guns and how people gain access to guns, and that he will not be satisfied unless some kind of action is taken on firearms before the end of his term.
[00:15:41.914 --> 00:15:54.583]  However, Rand Paul has introduced legislation intended to block any effort by the incumbent president to enforce gun control by executive action, relegating the president's potential action to an advisory position.
[00:15:54.743 --> 00:15:55.584]  Stock up, folks.
[00:15:55.964 --> 00:15:58.046]  Interesting times are upon us.
[00:15:58.366 --> 00:15:59.707]  But don't shoot your eye out.
[00:16:00.007 --> 00:16:01.788]  John Bowne for InfoWars.com.
[00:16:07.944 --> 00:16:16.828]  After yesterday's horrific tragedy in San Bernardino, California, people are demanding answers as to why assailants opened fire, killing 14 people and wounding several others.
[00:16:17.248 --> 00:16:20.790]  Some people have gone as far as to speculate it was because of Christmas.
[00:16:22.030 --> 00:16:25.572]  I think we will eventually get some indication on what that dispute was about.
[00:16:26.152 --> 00:16:27.593]  This was a holiday party.
[00:16:28.393 --> 00:16:30.274]  Maybe it was called a Christmas party.
[00:16:30.314 --> 00:16:32.675]  I mean, there's so many potential triggers here.
[00:16:33.939 --> 00:16:39.862]  We've seen groups like ISIS brag about how they use open immigration policies to sneak their militants into various nations.
[00:16:40.302 --> 00:16:46.065]  In reaction to this, many United States governors have said that they're not going to accept refugees into their respective states.
[00:16:46.465 --> 00:16:48.466]  Now, we know not all refugees are terrorists.
[00:16:48.706 --> 00:16:50.747]  We know most refugees are not militants.
[00:16:51.027 --> 00:17:01.673]  But with the flimsy excuse of a Christmas tree or Christmas decorations that set this guy off, we're going to ask the people here at UT, should we ban religious festivities on public universities?
[00:17:02.554 --> 00:17:05.838]  We're asking people if religious holidays should be allowed on public universities.
[00:17:06.538 --> 00:17:07.059]  Definitely.
[00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:10.343]  Religious holidays should be allowed in public universities?
[00:17:10.363 --> 00:17:10.943]  I think so.
[00:17:11.244 --> 00:17:18.572]  You mean like they should celebrate Christmas in a classroom or just set up like Christmas decorations on the sidewalk?
[00:17:18.592 --> 00:17:20.454]  Set up Christmas decorations on the sidewalk.
[00:17:20.922 --> 00:17:21.602]  Yeah, for sure.
[00:17:22.083 --> 00:17:25.384]  So if they set up something like a Christmas tree or anything like that, would that offend you at all?
[00:17:26.024 --> 00:17:26.905]  No, it wouldn't offend me.
[00:17:27.285 --> 00:17:28.765]  I think it's fine.
[00:17:28.985 --> 00:17:31.727]  So if they set up a Christmas tree or anything like that, that wouldn't offend you?
[00:17:32.107 --> 00:17:32.587]  No at all.
[00:17:33.687 --> 00:17:34.588]  It's all about respect.
[00:17:35.108 --> 00:17:39.130]  So if they set up a Christmas tree or something else out here, would that bother you at all?
[00:17:41.092 --> 00:17:44.134]  So somebody set up a Christmas tree out here that wouldn't offend you at all?
[00:17:44.514 --> 00:17:45.435]  No, not in the slightest.
[00:17:45.975 --> 00:17:52.639]  Because I don't know if you heard, many people are speculating that yesterday's very unfortunate shooting in San Bernardino was somehow religiously motivated.
[00:17:53.219 --> 00:18:03.666]  In California, but I feel like that's only relevant to like, only, there are a few outlier people who would actually go do that sort of thing, and I feel like it's more beneficial to let people celebrate their holidays.
[00:18:04.646 --> 00:18:05.287]  Thank you so much, sir.
[00:18:05.507 --> 00:18:05.767]  Thank you.
[00:18:16.317 --> 00:18:21.220]  Shane Steiner's involvement with InfoWarsLife.com truly happened in an organic way.
[00:18:35.768 --> 00:18:37.389]  I said, here, take some home, try it.
[00:18:37.489 --> 00:18:44.054]  Well, a few weeks later, he came in, blown away, and said, I want to buy three boxes of this stuff to give my friends and family.
[00:18:44.474 --> 00:18:45.975]  It's simply amazing.
[00:18:46.015 --> 00:18:47.276]  He said, why does it work so well?
[00:18:47.336 --> 00:18:51.859]  And I said, listen, go to Infowarslife.com, watch the informational videos with Dr. Group and others.
[00:18:52.079 --> 00:18:53.580]  They understand how it all works.
[00:18:53.860 --> 00:18:55.422]  I know that it works for me.
[00:18:55.562 --> 00:18:56.702]  That's all I understand.
[00:18:56.943 --> 00:19:02.006]  The science, the facts, the research, people's testimonials, they're all on Infowarslife.com.
[00:19:02.026 --> 00:19:02.987]  You can check it out for yourself.
[00:19:03.587 --> 00:19:04.689]  I wanted to go to the gym.
[00:19:04.949 --> 00:19:14.802]  I wanted to push myself and work out harder, and that led to me being able to come out and do stuff like the barefooting and the surfing and stuff like that, which I would have never done.
[00:19:14.822 --> 00:19:17.345]  I never would have done that two years ago.
[00:19:17.946 --> 00:19:21.570]  Shane has said over and over again, more than just libido and energy,
[00:19:22.111 --> 00:19:23.873]  It made him want to get into the gym more.
[00:19:24.214 --> 00:19:25.675]  It made him want to get in better shape.
[00:19:25.715 --> 00:19:28.338]  And believe me, the Steiners have amazing genetics.
[00:19:28.899 --> 00:19:31.322]  His brother is a world champion steer wrestler.
[00:19:31.662 --> 00:19:35.647]  His dad, Bobby Steiner, is a famous world champion bull rider.
[00:19:35.847 --> 00:19:37.509]  They've got natural genetics.
[00:19:37.949 --> 00:19:42.675]  But when you added this to the mix, in Shane's own words, it took him to the next level.
[00:19:54.972 --> 00:19:56.693]  Shane noticed the mental clarity.
[00:19:57.133 --> 00:20:00.615]  Bobby was able to work out longer and gain muscle mass.
[00:20:00.735 --> 00:20:02.036]  He's already completely shredded.
[00:20:02.236 --> 00:20:04.898]  I gotta admit, for me, the biggest effect has been libido.
[00:20:05.258 --> 00:20:11.302]  Now, I've never claimed to have a body like some beach model, but back when I was 20, 22 years old and worked out every day, I looked great.
[00:20:11.342 --> 00:20:17.365]  But over the years, being married, having three kids, working 18 hours a day, I gained basically 100 pounds.
[00:20:17.505 --> 00:20:20.647]  And it's been a long process of losing that weight in the last four years.
[00:20:20.807 --> 00:20:23.389]  But if you look at the photos and the videos,
[00:20:23.649 --> 00:20:23.909]  Of course!
[00:20:42.834 --> 00:20:52.898]  This has actually made me feel so good that here lately, about a year ago, I started training jiu-jitsu and that kind of led to doing some boxing and kickboxing.
[00:20:52.918 --> 00:21:05.404]  I mean, it's amazing that two years ago I was on the couch and couldn't even tie my shoes and now I'm training with MMA fighters and just doing stuff that I never thought that I would be doing ever again.
[00:21:05.684 --> 00:21:07.525]  So, Supermail Vitality has
[00:21:08.405 --> 00:21:08.926]  I don't know.
[00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:19.140]  You'll love it.
[00:22:03.072 --> 00:22:12.439]  Bottom line folks, you want to discover the power of super male vitality and super female vitality for yourself by visiting InfoWarsLife.com today or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:33.275]  I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
[00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:40.382]  The best-selling single of all time, in excess of a hundred million copies sold worldwide.
[00:22:40.862 --> 00:22:48.485]  But our college kids, raised in a narrative of white privilege and microaggression, think it's an offense to people of color.
[00:22:48.685 --> 00:22:54.327]  It's insulting to people of color, perpetuates the idea that white is naturally good, and that other colors are bad.
[00:22:54.747 --> 00:22:57.108]  And we feel that that's a microaggression.
[00:22:57.508 --> 00:22:58.889]  Here's a clue, boys and girls.
[00:22:59.569 --> 00:23:01.270]  It's about... Snow.
[00:23:03.152 --> 00:23:15.164]  The government educational establishment is destroying any connection to existing cultures so that they can create a new political culture, one of censorship and intolerance done in the name of tolerance.
[00:23:15.664 --> 00:23:16.365]  Fight back.
[00:23:16.845 --> 00:23:18.327]  Give the gift of knowledge.
[00:23:18.367 --> 00:23:22.551]  Send your friends to InfoWars, the cure for political correctness.
[00:23:22.631 --> 00:23:24.493]  And tell them Merry Christmas.
[00:23:38.254 --> 00:23:45.078]  But then coming up, I just want to say Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year coming up, because I used to hear this war on Christmas stuff 10 years ago and didn't believe it.
[00:23:45.798 --> 00:23:48.800]  And now they're taking the nativity signs out of people's own yards.
[00:23:49.300 --> 00:23:51.722]  People's churches are getting sued, not just government buildings.
[00:23:52.042 --> 00:23:56.745]  And now New York City Elementary Principal bans Christmas Thanksgiving Pledge of Allegiance.
[00:23:59.206 --> 00:24:02.290]  This is being reported on by New York Daily News, you name it, with a straight face.
[00:24:02.671 --> 00:24:04.073]  We definitely can't say Christmas.
[00:24:04.453 --> 00:24:05.294]  You can't say it.
[00:24:05.715 --> 00:24:07.417]  See, now it extends to your free speech.
[00:24:07.457 --> 00:24:08.238]  Of course you can say it.
[00:24:09.179 --> 00:24:10.341]  Nothing with Christmas on it.
[00:24:10.461 --> 00:24:12.524]  Nothing with Santa, who's not even Christian.
[00:24:13.766 --> 00:24:14.467]  He's a elf.
[00:24:16.710 --> 00:24:23.473]  And they have, the principal has banned it, saying, you know, the foreigners don't like it, but they can have all their celebrations.
[00:24:23.533 --> 00:24:37.278]  And meanwhile, a student gets six months suspension for saying black women are not hot, in a response to a chat board, where reportedly black students were saying that white people were hillbillies, that have sex with their family members, and have small genitals.
[00:24:38.338 --> 00:24:44.002]  And the school actually said, blacks are allowed to say that, whites can't even respond, and he was suspended for 20 months.
[00:24:45.143 --> 00:24:53.729]  When they proved that, 21 months, excuse me, when they proved that it was the black students doing it first, they said, well they're allowed to, but your suspension's only six months.
[00:24:57.052 --> 00:24:58.093]  How do you like that?
[00:24:58.613 --> 00:25:05.138]  It's only gonna get better, folks, because this country is rotting like a big fat dead fish in the summer heat.
[00:25:06.687 --> 00:25:09.809]  House Republicans are having to propose a resolution defending Christmas.
[00:25:13.552 --> 00:25:23.819]  Because all over the country, they're actually telling people in public schools and colleges, you can't have a tree in your dorm.
[00:25:24.159 --> 00:25:25.420]  You can't have one in your room.
[00:25:25.861 --> 00:25:27.562]  You can't even talk about Christmas.
[00:25:27.882 --> 00:25:29.223]  You can't hand out Bibles.
[00:25:29.543 --> 00:25:30.664]  You have no free speech.
[00:25:30.844 --> 00:25:31.805]  But everyone else does.
[00:25:32.125 --> 00:25:33.746]  You can't hand out constitutions.
[00:25:33.886 --> 00:25:34.387]  I have seen
[00:25:35.734 --> 00:25:38.356]  More than 20 plus colleges in the last year.
[00:25:38.376 --> 00:25:40.677]  I see it every week or so.
[00:25:40.858 --> 00:25:44.160]  Arrest students that hand out pocket constitutions.
[00:25:47.975 --> 00:25:49.836]  Everybody else is allowed to hand out whatever they want.
[00:25:50.236 --> 00:25:55.259]  If it's seen as Americana or part of the American culture, it is banned.
[00:25:55.480 --> 00:25:56.540]  People go, this is outrageous.
[00:25:56.560 --> 00:25:57.201]  It's over the top.
[00:25:57.481 --> 00:25:58.381]  It's totalitarian.
[00:25:58.421 --> 00:25:59.142]  It's authoritarian.
[00:25:59.462 --> 00:26:00.443]  Why are they doing this?
[00:26:00.463 --> 00:26:01.583]  They're supposed to be liberal.
[00:26:02.024 --> 00:26:03.444]  They're not liberals.
[00:26:03.564 --> 00:26:05.406]  They're power grabbing.
[00:26:06.846 --> 00:26:11.809]  They're taking us a trillion miles, hoping we only battle back 500 billion.
[00:26:13.541 --> 00:26:17.745]  They'll still have us 500 billion miles down a black hole.
[00:26:23.772 --> 00:26:25.714]  They know what they're doing.
[00:26:26.575 --> 00:26:30.459]  They are a scientific military operation.
[00:26:33.663 --> 00:26:43.612]  Putin's come out and said the global warming system is a global military operation to destroy nation states and bankrupt the individual for social engineering, which is exactly what it is.
[00:26:45.814 --> 00:26:49.477]  You are facing a scientific military operation.
[00:26:50.057 --> 00:26:52.920]  If you're unconscious of it, you will be destroyed and enslaved.
[00:26:53.260 --> 00:26:53.761]  Dumb down.
[00:26:55.111 --> 00:27:05.615]  But if you are aware of it and will research it, it's fantastical, it's incredible, you'll be able to defend yourself, you'll be informed, you will accelerate in life, in business, in culture.
[00:27:06.636 --> 00:27:08.457]  The coolest thing to be is awake.
[00:27:09.057 --> 00:27:12.358]  The most powerful thing to be is awake and strong and focused.
[00:27:12.959 --> 00:27:20.502]  And not a chump, not a schmuck, not an idiot, not a sucker, not a dumbo, not a dodo bird, not a mark.
[00:27:27.898 --> 00:27:31.160]  The future must not belong to those who slander the prophet of Islam.
[00:27:45.668 --> 00:27:50.130]  To see the totalitarian left allied with radical Islam is truly disgusting.
[00:27:50.150 --> 00:27:51.972]  But it's worse than that.
[00:27:52.012 --> 00:27:54.233]  The Republican leadership continues to allow
[00:27:55.822 --> 00:27:59.565]  Hundreds of thousands of radicals to come into the United States every year.
[00:28:00.145 --> 00:28:03.488]  And believe me, the folks coming out of Syria and other countries are extremely radical.
[00:28:05.189 --> 00:28:07.871]  And they are not compatible with Western civilization.
[00:28:08.652 --> 00:28:14.036]  They fight with each other and kill each other constantly over tiny disagreements on religion.
[00:28:14.476 --> 00:28:19.640]  This is truly barbarous, dark age type idiocy.
[00:28:21.437 --> 00:28:24.139]  At the same time, the left is trying to ban Christmas.
[00:28:24.779 --> 00:28:26.860]  Here's the story up on InfoWars.com.
[00:28:28.421 --> 00:28:38.568]  Universities across the country deem Secret Santa, Mistletoe, colors red-green to be politically incorrect.
[00:28:39.744 --> 00:28:42.026]  It's also sexual harassment to have mistletoe.
[00:28:42.526 --> 00:28:43.687]  So see, they all mix it together.
[00:28:44.107 --> 00:28:49.531]  New guidelines demand holiday celebrations are not a Christmas party in disguise.
[00:28:50.172 --> 00:28:53.795]  We have to talk about, don't disguise your Christmas party or we'll ban it.
[00:28:54.995 --> 00:29:01.801]  You've seen the rioting, the freaking out, the, you've got to ban Halloween, I might see the costume, I don't like, don't do it, oh please!
[00:29:06.124 --> 00:29:20.383]  I mean, look at the photo, if you're a TV viewer, of a man and woman kissing each other with mistletoe, and then go to the front page of Infowars.com and look at the head of ISIS that this family, this husband and wife, pledged allegiance to.
[00:29:20.804 --> 00:29:21.865]  And just look at the difference.
[00:29:22.679 --> 00:29:35.206]  That's how we want to be in the West, happy, having a nice Christmas, and then we got these other people running around killing each other, and killing Muslims that don't want to be radicals, and killing every Christian they get their hands on, and I'm just sick of it.
[00:29:35.446 --> 00:29:39.428]  And I just want to say, the left are a sickening group of totalitarian filth.
[00:29:41.629 --> 00:29:42.469]  That's all I can say.
[00:29:43.910 --> 00:29:44.530]  And I've had enough.
[00:29:44.550 --> 00:29:48.392]  In fact, scroll up a little bit on M4s, because it says it all, those images.
[00:29:48.673 --> 00:29:51.094]  Look at radical Islam, then look at Christianity.
[00:29:53.117 --> 00:29:57.040]  You can say, well, Christianity isn't people wearing red and white hats and a Christmas tree.
[00:29:57.320 --> 00:29:58.381]  It doesn't matter!
[00:29:59.622 --> 00:30:18.335]  It's part of the Christian culture, mixed with European culture, and it is about Christ, and the system wants to get rid of it because it's pretty, and it's happy, and it's about Ebenezer Scrooge giving his money to the poor, and it's about real liberalism, and they don't like it because they're totalitarian scum!
[00:30:22.691 --> 00:30:25.673]  There it is, the Boston Post, Christmas banned in Boston.
[00:30:29.496 --> 00:30:36.681]  And even back 300 years ago, some of the Christian churches tried to ban it, saying it was sacrilege and wasn't properly being engaged in.
[00:30:36.701 --> 00:30:40.764]  Because folks like to go out and dance and sing and have a little bit of fun.
[00:30:42.446 --> 00:30:45.548]  And I'm against radical Christianity trying to control people.
[00:30:46.786 --> 00:30:49.727]  Because we don't have state-run religion in this country.
[00:30:50.168 --> 00:30:55.390]  The separation of church and state means the government has no jurisdiction in religion.
[00:30:56.290 --> 00:31:01.113]  Now, if someone in a religion breaks the law, then that's a different subject altogether.
[00:31:01.473 --> 00:31:05.335]  But as long as you don't do that, there is no jurisdiction.
[00:31:06.135 --> 00:31:20.186]  Well, planning suicide vests and pipe bombs and planning to go kill everybody at work for the jihad you pledged allegiance to under ISIS orders to commit jihad is a premeditated plan to commit mass murder and is illegal!
[00:31:21.747 --> 00:31:26.711]  But they admit under political correctness couldn't do it and now attacker pledged allegiance to ISIS officials say.
[00:31:28.269 --> 00:31:30.591]  That is the Associated Press, that is CNN as well.
[00:31:30.631 --> 00:31:31.911]  But that's hardly even in the news.
[00:31:31.931 --> 00:31:34.733]  They're still on a lot of channels, because we've got all of them on around here.
[00:31:35.153 --> 00:31:39.956]  All the big ones, each room has a different CNN, MSNBC, CNBC, ABC, Fox.
[00:31:41.817 --> 00:31:44.319]  They're still acting like it could be workplace violence.
[00:31:45.980 --> 00:31:52.143]  I guess World War II was workplace violence, or 9-11 was workplace violence, or I guess the theater attack three weeks ago was workplace violence.
[00:31:52.203 --> 00:31:54.745]  No, this is the beginning of another attack.
[00:31:55.672 --> 00:32:05.138]  And of more attacks, just like they said the Fort Hood killing 14 people under Al-Qaeda command, saying he did it for Al-Qaeda and for the Taliban.
[00:32:06.478 --> 00:32:09.560]  Major Assange, not a terror attack.
[00:32:10.160 --> 00:32:12.402]  Attacks on recruiting centers, not attacks.
[00:32:12.442 --> 00:32:14.243]  Attack in Garland, not an attack.
[00:32:14.623 --> 00:32:16.044]  All these attacks, not attacks.
[00:32:17.305 --> 00:32:20.666]  Can you imagine if Christians were running around doing something like this?
[00:32:20.987 --> 00:32:23.068]  You'd never hear the end of it.
[00:32:27.142 --> 00:32:36.428]  You guys have the exclusive for which is a product called Deep Cleanse and why I'm so excited about it is it's a unique formula almost like the iodine crystals.
[00:32:36.508 --> 00:32:40.270]  We have two unique products that nobody in the world has.
[00:32:40.650 --> 00:32:52.437]  One of the most amazing ingredients in the world and it's called Shilajit and it's actually known as blood of the mountain or rock sweat because thousands of years ago, as a matter of fact, this ingredient
[00:32:52.637 --> 00:32:59.040]  Was only given to the elite of the elite thousands of years ago up in the Himalayan mountains and in Tibet.
[00:32:59.080 --> 00:33:02.902]  And we wanted to put this in stuff for a couple years, but we couldn't get an organic form.
[00:33:03.082 --> 00:33:03.302]  Right.
[00:33:03.382 --> 00:33:04.422]  I mean, let's explain.
[00:33:04.482 --> 00:33:07.624]  I mean, this stuff's so good, we couldn't put it out for years.
[00:33:07.904 --> 00:33:16.353]  Right, so I had to actually, it's kind of like the iodine crystals, finding a source deep in the earth that we could get the cleanest source available.
[00:33:16.793 --> 00:33:26.343]  But in Tibet and in Nepal and in the Himalayan mountains, thousands of years ago they found, they watched these monkeys and during the summer months the monkeys would go up into the mountains.
[00:33:26.363 --> 00:33:27.625]  Now you're being racist against monkeys.
[00:33:27.665 --> 00:33:28.306]  And they would pick
[00:33:28.806 --> 00:33:31.207]  This black substance from the mountains.
[00:33:31.668 --> 00:33:38.171]  And so in Russia, they actually, it grows in Russia and the mountains and in the Himalayas and only in the summer.
[00:33:38.272 --> 00:33:46.476]  And shilajit is actually the decomposition of up to 7,000 different medicinal herbs.
[00:33:46.536 --> 00:33:53.200]  So it decomposes, all these different herbs decompose in the Himalayan mountains and the volcanic soil up there.
[00:33:53.460 --> 00:33:57.483]  And what happens in the summertime... So it's almost like an oil from
[00:33:58.343 --> 00:34:01.126]  Yes, it's high in fulvic acid, it's high in humic acid.
[00:34:01.167 --> 00:34:05.411]  They're always claiming oil is really from decomposed animals and plants.
[00:34:05.972 --> 00:34:10.417]  There is some oil that is based from fossils, but most of it's really abiotic.
[00:34:10.818 --> 00:34:14.802]  So this is a true fossil source?
[00:34:14.823 --> 00:34:15.583]  I mean, explain it to me.
[00:34:16.284 --> 00:34:16.624]  It is.
[00:34:17.024 --> 00:34:22.345]  It's really the decomposition, like I said, of over 7,000 different medicinal herbs and plants.
[00:34:22.505 --> 00:34:26.306]  And with the rocks and the pressure deep in the mountains, it freezes.
[00:34:26.366 --> 00:34:31.327]  And during the summertime and the pressures build it up, it oozes out.
[00:34:31.427 --> 00:34:33.007]  So it literally oozes out of the mountain.
[00:34:33.027 --> 00:34:33.827]  It's like rock sap.
[00:34:34.187 --> 00:34:35.188]  It's like rock sap.
[00:34:35.228 --> 00:34:38.348]  It's black and it's highly nutritious.
[00:34:39.188 --> 00:34:41.809]  Even in the 1980s, when the Olympic
[00:34:42.529 --> 00:34:44.850]  Athletes in Russia were accused of being on steroids.
[00:34:44.890 --> 00:34:52.231]  They found out that they were actually been given Shilajit because it works as an anabolic as well and it builds muscles.
[00:34:52.431 --> 00:34:53.491]  It's a big dose in there.
[00:34:53.511 --> 00:35:03.234]  The second big main ingredient in there is a volcanic zeolite concentrate and what this formula is designed to do, the Shilajit and the zeolites have a real strong negative charge.
[00:35:03.694 --> 00:35:08.615]  All the metals and chemicals and PCBs and VOCs have positive charges.
[00:35:09.415 --> 00:35:17.525]  So these go in, they grab it, and then they safely eliminate it through the body so you can become healthy.
[00:35:17.565 --> 00:35:21.509]  I mean, this is an amazing formula.
[00:35:21.649 --> 00:35:27.516]  I wish I actually had it, but because this was an exclusive InfoWars Life product, you're the only one in the world that has.
[00:35:28.137 --> 00:35:36.043]  This formula now, and you know, there is going to be a limited supply available when you sell out because you can only harvest this once a year.
[00:35:36.183 --> 00:35:37.243]  How do people take it?
[00:35:37.303 --> 00:35:39.625]  How is it recommended that this be done?
[00:35:39.725 --> 00:35:41.426]  Just a daily dose?
[00:35:41.707 --> 00:35:43.428]  Yeah, daily dose.
[00:35:43.528 --> 00:35:44.889]  The instructions are on the label.
[00:35:44.929 --> 00:35:48.331]  You know, of course, I kind of modify it for each individual.
[00:35:48.351 --> 00:35:49.912]  It depends on what your lifestyle is.
[00:35:49.952 --> 00:35:55.076]  I mean, honestly, the best thing to do is for you to avoid all these chemicals and toxins in your environment.
[00:35:55.416 --> 00:35:55.816]  I don't know.
[00:36:16.963 --> 00:36:20.207]  Because these aren't just great products, this is how we fund this independent operation.
[00:36:20.227 --> 00:36:25.434]  We're not taxpayer funded, like MSNBC or NPR, and neither is your local station, so support them, folks.
[00:36:25.635 --> 00:36:26.236]  This is a war.
[00:36:38.015 --> 00:36:53.202]  Rob Jacobson is here in studio with us and he had an idea Friday to have a contest for a meme because they're banning Christmas trees and saying don't have secret Christmas celebrations at your college or we'll suspend you.
[00:36:53.563 --> 00:36:59.685]  So Rob said we ought to have a meme on Facebook and Twitter that says hey we're going to promote whatever we want.
[00:36:59.726 --> 00:37:02.027]  I mean whether you like Halloween, like Christmas, like
[00:37:03.428 --> 00:37:05.530]  I don't know, what's a Muslim holiday?
[00:37:05.931 --> 00:37:06.692]  Ramadan?
[00:37:07.032 --> 00:37:07.633]  Hanukkah?
[00:37:08.173 --> 00:37:15.001]  Whatever the holiday is, people have a right to have it, and if you've got a problem with it, that means you're intolerant and mentally ill, you're not liberal.
[00:37:15.222 --> 00:37:19.827]  Well, now the liberals say, no, no, we ban everything, but whatever the most radical garbage is...
[00:37:20.868 --> 00:37:22.449]  It's just all part of an act of dominance.
[00:37:22.489 --> 00:37:23.789]  So, we had the contest.
[00:37:23.809 --> 00:37:24.190]  It's $1,000.
[00:37:24.230 --> 00:37:25.730]  We're going to pick the winner now.
[00:37:25.770 --> 00:37:26.531]  You've got to email us.
[00:37:26.951 --> 00:37:29.292]  I'll mail the $1,000 out in the next couple days to you.
[00:37:29.732 --> 00:37:34.575]  We've got another contest, Make Fun of Hillary contest, that comes up that we're announcing next year, but those videos are coming in.
[00:37:34.875 --> 00:37:38.476]  But, Jacobson, let's go over the winner right now for TV viewers, for radio listeners.
[00:37:38.496 --> 00:37:40.998]  We just posted the article at InfoWars.com.
[00:37:41.018 --> 00:37:41.698]  We'll put it on screen.
[00:37:42.078 --> 00:37:47.461]  Showing the winner with some of the runner-ups, but everybody's a winner, standing up for free speech and showing how crazy it is.
[00:37:47.801 --> 00:37:48.481]  There is the winner.
[00:37:48.501 --> 00:37:49.942]  Let's scroll down and show folks the winner.
[00:37:50.282 --> 00:37:50.863]  And click on it.
[00:37:51.183 --> 00:37:52.024]  Come and take it.
[00:37:52.325 --> 00:37:53.766]  Describe it for radio listeners.
[00:37:54.087 --> 00:37:56.269]  Alright, well, this is the winner that we chose.
[00:37:56.329 --> 00:37:58.772]  It's the come and take it meme.
[00:37:59.293 --> 00:38:01.916]  And we liked it because it says a lot, you know.
[00:38:03.618 --> 00:38:07.682]  Reminiscent of the classic, you know, World War II, you know, the guys.
[00:38:07.702 --> 00:38:08.483]  Iwo Jima.
[00:38:08.623 --> 00:38:11.846]  Iwo Jima, you know, they're lifting up victory, you know.
[00:38:12.567 --> 00:38:21.315]  It's American, it really feels like InfoWars, and Come and Take It is something we, it celebrates not only the First Amendment here, but the Second Amendment as well.
[00:38:21.335 --> 00:38:26.840]  They're up there on a hill with just blasted off trees everywhere, dead bodies everywhere, and they're hauling up the American flag.
[00:38:26.860 --> 00:38:28.242]  Well now they're hauling up the Christmas tree.
[00:38:28.442 --> 00:38:28.863]  Exactly.
[00:38:28.883 --> 00:38:30.364]  They're really hauling up free speech.
[00:38:30.384 --> 00:38:33.048]  They're hauling up free speech because that's what's being taken from us.
[00:38:33.508 --> 00:38:35.551]  I mean, we can't even celebrate.
[00:38:35.571 --> 00:38:36.712]  We're going to have to fight for it.
[00:38:37.013 --> 00:38:37.453]  Exactly.
[00:38:38.433 --> 00:38:44.095]  The thing, I agree with you Alex, I've been listening today and the rhetoric going on in this country is unbelievable.
[00:38:44.256 --> 00:38:46.436]  It's beyond even my own imagination.
[00:38:46.456 --> 00:38:49.718]  I can't believe that people are offended by Christmas.
[00:38:49.838 --> 00:38:50.918]  It is Twilight Zone.
[00:38:50.938 --> 00:38:56.741]  Plus Christmas is this super inclusive winter festival with lights and trees and I mean give me a break man!
[00:38:56.881 --> 00:38:58.782]  As a guy who grew up in New York City...
[00:38:59.702 --> 00:39:01.023]  It's a Christmas kind of city.
[00:39:01.323 --> 00:39:03.005]  I guess everything they're gonna do in New York City.
[00:39:03.025 --> 00:39:04.846]  Did you ever, were you ever offended by it?
[00:39:04.866 --> 00:39:08.809]  Oh yeah, when I was a little kid I was, oh I was weeping when I said, no that's a joke.
[00:39:08.829 --> 00:39:09.450]  You liked Christmas?
[00:39:09.510 --> 00:39:10.291]  I loved Christmas.
[00:39:10.331 --> 00:39:11.632]  I mean it was a winter thing.
[00:39:11.912 --> 00:39:16.095]  It was the winter celebration when I went to New York City with my family.
[00:39:16.135 --> 00:39:18.277]  We, I mean, we went to Rockefeller Center.
[00:39:18.917 --> 00:39:21.039]  It was... Oh that one's good with the jihadist over there.
[00:39:21.059 --> 00:39:21.800]  That one was good.
[00:39:22.620 --> 00:39:25.643]  We had a lot of fun looking at all of these entries.
[00:39:25.683 --> 00:39:27.164]  It was, some of them are very...
[00:39:27.244 --> 00:39:37.550]  And now folks can have fun hauling up the tree against evil again by going to Infowars.com and the story that has all these memes and posting them to your Facebook, your Twitter, and elsewhere.
[00:39:38.370 --> 00:39:40.211]  Yeah, I mean, all the entries.
[00:39:40.231 --> 00:39:48.136]  We got a lot of entries and it seems that everybody's aware of the fact that free speech is absolutely essential to be expressed right now.
[00:39:49.177 --> 00:39:52.739]  If any time in history, it's time for everybody to just say what they need to, you know, if
[00:39:53.319 --> 00:39:54.440]  If you like something, say it.
[00:39:54.480 --> 00:39:55.601]  If you don't like something, say it.
[00:39:55.621 --> 00:39:57.483]  It's all what this country is about.
[00:39:57.523 --> 00:39:59.124]  It's about free expression, free thought.
[00:39:59.145 --> 00:40:07.773]  Yeah, they're trying to blame speech now, going, well, maybe he didn't like a Christmas tree, and there was this Jewish guy that was a Messianic Jew, and he would talk about Christ, so maybe he deserved it.
[00:40:07.793 --> 00:40:11.897]  I mean, that's in the news, that some Jewish guy talked about Jesus, so he gets his head blown off.
[00:40:12.237 --> 00:40:13.078]  I mean, this is sick.
[00:40:13.278 --> 00:40:14.319]  But that's okay.
[00:40:15.080 --> 00:40:16.301]  Also, protected groups.
[00:40:16.941 --> 00:40:18.042]  Here we have protected groups.
[00:40:18.102 --> 00:40:26.869]  Some people are allowed to be absolutely slammed, some groups, while other groups are, oh, wait a minute, you know, maybe it's not, maybe it's not jihad.
[00:40:27.189 --> 00:40:35.615]  We haven't really cleared this issue out when all the evidence points that way, when trends... When radical Islam is a scourge on Muslims and kills more Muslims than anybody.
[00:40:36.316 --> 00:40:39.398]  I don't believe that there is no such thing as non-radical Islam.
[00:40:39.458 --> 00:40:41.479]  I know there are a lot of groups that want to be left alone.
[00:40:41.680 --> 00:40:43.001]  Now some would call them apostate,
[00:40:43.863 --> 00:40:45.705]  But whatever, these are smart, hard-working people.
[00:40:45.725 --> 00:40:47.026]  A lot of them are my friends.
[00:40:47.627 --> 00:40:49.328]  And they're the ones that are threatened by this as well.
[00:40:49.528 --> 00:40:49.969]  Exactly.
[00:40:49.989 --> 00:40:51.951]  And the reality is the reality.
[00:40:51.991 --> 00:40:57.936]  There is a presence of this historically... The reality is radical Islam does not even compete with a free society.
[00:40:58.257 --> 00:40:58.697]  Exactly.
[00:40:58.737 --> 00:40:59.938]  They have their own set of laws.
[00:40:59.958 --> 00:41:01.780]  It's like bringing cannibals in to live in your neighborhood.
[00:41:01.980 --> 00:41:08.244]  You know, it's a centuries old thing, you know, a century old... The Dark Age craziness.
[00:41:08.504 --> 00:41:10.926]  That's been going on for centuries, and they're not done yet.
[00:41:11.046 --> 00:41:13.188]  All they do is kill each other in these radical areas.
[00:41:13.248 --> 00:41:31.680]  Exactly, and the thing is that there are, of course, there's different sections of Islam, and maybe not as radical, but there are many sections, a percentage of radical Islams, and even a percentage of such a large population on this planet represents there are going to be some people who are going to be radicalized, whereas the mainstream press
[00:41:32.440 --> 00:41:36.383]  I think Dow a Day is doing an amazing job at cherry-picking.
[00:41:36.543 --> 00:41:37.643]  Now, we've got the winner.
[00:41:37.663 --> 00:41:39.164]  I know they sent us an email with their info.
[00:41:39.184 --> 00:41:40.305]  Do we know how to get in contact with them?
[00:41:40.345 --> 00:41:40.605]  Yes.
[00:41:41.706 --> 00:41:46.128]  The winner is, of course, the entry we just saw.
[00:41:46.789 --> 00:41:47.489]  We contacted him.
[00:41:47.529 --> 00:41:49.250]  Mr. Travis T, come and take it.
[00:41:49.831 --> 00:41:51.451]  Alright, so he's going to win the thousand bucks.
[00:41:51.511 --> 00:41:51.952]  He got it.
[00:41:52.332 --> 00:41:52.712]  Beautiful.
[00:41:52.812 --> 00:41:53.573]  Alright, good job.
[00:41:53.653 --> 00:41:55.154]  Rob Jacobson, thanks for helping me with that contest.
[00:41:55.174 --> 00:41:55.594]  You're welcome.
[00:42:05.179 --> 00:42:11.323]  Hello, I'm Mr. Moneybags, and I have a message for all of you out there this Christmas season.
[00:42:12.324 --> 00:42:21.510]  As you sit down with your family and friends, you need to be thankful of the unseen hand that has guided your monetary system for the last 101 years now.
[00:42:22.031 --> 00:42:32.318]  That's right, thanks to some members of an unknown group who decided they should take it upon themselves to control the monetary supply for the betterment of the collective as a whole.
[00:42:33.157 --> 00:42:41.263]  When ultra mega rich people like myself want to help little people like you, we have to make sure our assets have cover.
[00:42:42.064 --> 00:42:47.548]  We like to have our losses shared by the public, but keep our profits private and to ourselves.
[00:42:49.795 --> 00:43:06.426]  So my unknown group, which included the heads of JP Morgan, Rockefeller, National City Bank of New York, First National Bank of New York, and the founder of the Council on Foreign Relations, met on an island on the coast of Georgia for a, quote, hunting trip.
[00:43:08.100 --> 00:43:14.845]  We would divide the country, I mean banking system, into 15 districts, with one main office in Washington, D.C.
[00:43:15.645 --> 00:43:29.415]  We didn't want the government meddling in our affairs, so we had a ceremonial pitchman position created, and that person would be the focal point for all criticism and damnation when the people discovered that printing money out of thin air would cause inflation.
[00:43:30.316 --> 00:43:39.240]  This person was known as the Chairman, and our little banking organization we called the Federal Reserve, which is about as federal as Federal Express.
[00:43:39.460 --> 00:43:42.262]  Oh, I love that one.
[00:43:43.182 --> 00:43:53.607]  We ran this little plan through Congress and the Senate in just two days in late December, and we had our little agent Woodrow Wilson sign it just two days before Christmas.
[00:43:54.408 --> 00:43:56.569]  Ah, the most wonderful time of year.
[00:43:58.047 --> 00:44:07.496]  Anyway, flash forward 101 years, and we have fully recovered from the recessions of 2008, 2000, early 90s, early 80s, mid 70s, late 60s, early 60s, the recessions of 58, 53, 49, 45, 38, 37, and 33, which started back in 1929.
[00:44:20.796 --> 00:44:28.544]  The stock market has never been higher, billionaires are buying all in New York City, and I've never had so much money for my bags!
[00:44:29.384 --> 00:44:31.647]  Which is why I believe I was put here on this earth.
[00:44:32.267 --> 00:44:39.834]  Never mind economic production, unemployment, reduced labor pool, outsourcing of factories, or money backed by something tangible.
[00:44:40.595 --> 00:44:48.420]  As long as we have ones and zeros, we can kick you and your children's future down the road until it's too late for your peons to stop us.
[00:44:49.400 --> 00:44:56.365]  So Merry Christmas from the Federal Reserve, celebrating 101 years of economic disparity and financial ruin.
[00:44:56.925 --> 00:45:01.268]  Except for those of us who know the inside of the money-to-bags ratio quotient.
[00:45:14.482 --> 00:45:20.816]  Don't worry, your precious in the Fed movement will never regain traction, now that the race riots have started!
[00:45:40.439 --> 00:45:43.706]  Merry Christmas, Hilary.
[00:45:44.287 --> 00:45:47.293]  Your words, they smell like poo.
[00:45:48.736 --> 00:45:49.698]  Rancid St.
[00:45:49.819 --> 00:45:50.520]  Keith.
[00:45:54.127 --> 00:46:02.049]  And in your soul there is a smell, much like doggy do.
[00:46:02.089 --> 00:46:08.591]  So I say to you, Merry Christmas, Hillary.
[00:46:08.791 --> 00:46:12.992]  Your words, they smell like poo.
[00:46:13.012 --> 00:46:15.793]  No one believes in you.
[00:46:37.975 --> 00:46:38.997]  Brain Force is here.
[00:46:39.517 --> 00:46:41.801]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:46:42.081 --> 00:46:49.932]  You probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of Brain Force.
[00:46:50.731 --> 00:46:53.912]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable.
[00:46:54.172 --> 00:46:54.312]  Right?
[00:46:54.332 --> 00:46:56.673]  You're gonna crash and gonna feel really bad afterwards.
[00:46:57.033 --> 00:47:00.574]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[00:47:00.614 --> 00:47:03.755]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[00:47:04.255 --> 00:47:09.057]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[00:47:09.597 --> 00:47:11.457]  For example, the L-theanine inside of it.
[00:47:11.817 --> 00:47:16.259]  That is activated by the different compounds in the Yerba Mate that we put inside of it as well.
[00:47:16.419 --> 00:47:18.439]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[00:47:19.060 --> 00:47:20.520]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.
[00:47:20.680 --> 00:47:20.820]  Exactly.
[00:47:20.840 --> 00:47:24.742]  It's kind of like a car will run on one form of junky gas, but it runs really good on what it's designed for.
[00:47:25.262 --> 00:47:33.306]  You will find Brain Force, Survival Shield X2, and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:47:38.197 --> 00:47:43.202]  Introducing Secret 12, the new InfoWars Life vitamin B12 formulation.
[00:47:43.443 --> 00:47:49.549]  Most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic, and cannot be properly absorbed by the body.
[00:47:49.749 --> 00:47:56.717]  That's why for real results, so many are having to turn to painful B12 injections, which are known to have higher absorption rates.
[00:47:57.057 --> 00:48:07.003]  Now, InfoWarsLife.com is excited to announce that we can bring you our most bioactive, powerful form of B12 that has been developed with our exclusive, perfected process.
[00:48:07.563 --> 00:48:13.486]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimedical-grade, bioavailable, coenzyme forms of B12.
[00:48:13.726 --> 00:48:16.888]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections, and
[00:48:17.188 --> 00:48:18.289]  Adenosylcobalamin.
[00:48:18.549 --> 00:48:21.890]  Secret 12 is simply taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.
[00:48:22.151 --> 00:48:23.771]  No needles, no injections.
[00:48:24.031 --> 00:48:25.512]  Don't take my word for it.
[00:48:25.692 --> 00:48:26.713]  Try it for yourself.
[00:48:26.893 --> 00:48:27.893]  Discover the secret.
[00:48:28.113 --> 00:48:28.454]  Secret 12.
[00:48:29.194 --> 00:48:34.357]  Secure your revolutionary Secret 12 formula right now at Infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:48:47.776 --> 00:48:57.484]  Now joining us from in front of the Tenenbaum, in front of the Christmas tree, down in front of the Texas State House, is Jakari Jackson.
[00:48:58.165 --> 00:49:04.190]  And I would also add, he's down there with Joe Jennings running camera, we're talking to some of the crowds, there are moves, lawsuits in Texas to remove that.
[00:49:04.730 --> 00:49:09.153]  To remove nativity scenes all over Texas, even from churches that are private.
[00:49:09.413 --> 00:49:10.634]  The atheists don't want to look at it.
[00:49:10.954 --> 00:49:12.195]  This is happening all over the country.
[00:49:12.555 --> 00:49:19.720]  The governor's had to basically pass laws and sign executive orders blocking the state removing nativities.
[00:49:20.460 --> 00:49:31.347]  The governor also, as Jakari is going to be reporting on the nightly news from the Capitol, has also filed a lawsuit over the refugees that Jakari went and reported last week on, 300 of them at one church.
[00:49:32.868 --> 00:49:35.150]  High school alone, my alma mater, Anderson.
[00:49:35.410 --> 00:49:39.034]  So that's coming up as well, but Jakari Jackson's across from the tree.
[00:49:39.454 --> 00:49:47.741]  He's been talking to some of the locals, and they're now asking the question at NBC, did the jihadis attack because they saw a Christmas tree at the health department, Jakari?
[00:49:47.781 --> 00:49:50.744]  I mean, this would be comedy if it wasn't so sickening, Jakari.
[00:49:52.005 --> 00:49:56.210]  Jakari Jackson reporting in Austin, Texas, documenting the war on Christmas.
[00:49:56.230 --> 00:49:59.694]  I guess as you say, Alex, they have been coming after the Christmas trees.
[00:49:59.714 --> 00:50:02.357]  I saw that clip that you were alluding to on MSNBC.
[00:50:02.377 --> 00:50:04.139]  They were asking, you know, what set this guy off?
[00:50:04.399 --> 00:50:06.622]  You know, was it some kind of trigger at a holiday party?
[00:50:07.562 --> 00:50:12.385]  Whatever set this guy off, set him off long before he entered that holiday party, Alex, that Christmas party.
[00:50:12.805 --> 00:50:19.208]  The guy had body armor, he had homemade explosives, he had his guns, all his armaments ready to go.
[00:50:19.268 --> 00:50:21.990]  He was just looking for the opportune moment to bring those out.
[00:50:23.390 --> 00:50:24.111]  That's right, Jakar.
[00:50:24.131 --> 00:50:30.056]  And I know you're going to try to target some crowds, but there's not folks really out there right now after the lunch hour in front of the Capitol.
[00:50:30.116 --> 00:50:36.582]  But I just can't believe we even have to report on the fact that there are lawsuits trying to remove the Christmas tree behind you.
[00:50:37.203 --> 00:50:40.306]  I mean, these people really are about dominating culture.
[00:50:41.414 --> 00:50:47.698]  Yeah, they are, because the former governor of Texas, Rick Perry, he actually had to come down, and that's one of the good things I can actually say about the guy.
[00:50:47.718 --> 00:50:54.543]  One of the few good things is he came out, he said, I want the Christmas trees and the nativity scenes, all these things to remain in the state of Texas.
[00:50:54.843 --> 00:50:58.085]  And as you're alluding to, Alex, it's been all over, not just here in Texas.
[00:50:58.105 --> 00:51:00.887]  There is a story in Virginia that's been in the news recently.
[00:51:00.927 --> 00:51:04.189]  The VA in Virginia is now banning Christmas trees in their facilities.
[00:51:04.509 --> 00:51:11.034]  They're even saying that you can't sing Christmas carols or anything that's even remotely related to any type of religious ceremony.
[00:51:11.814 --> 00:51:17.878]  And in Germany and in Italy and other places they're trying to ban kids having Christmas carols even at private schools.
[00:51:18.379 --> 00:51:22.101]  Outdoor Christmas parades are being cancelled in case someone gets offended.
[00:51:22.161 --> 00:51:22.802]  My God!
[00:51:23.142 --> 00:51:26.164]  How did we turn into this Soviet state overnight?
[00:51:27.162 --> 00:51:44.151]  Well, it's always about if somebody is offended, somebody is offended, but they have no problem trying to offend Christians or allowing Christians to be offended, taking their rights away, taking away their holidays and festivities, having kids in class stomp on the name of Jesus and do all these other things, but they wouldn't dare do that to a Muslim student.
[00:51:45.312 --> 00:51:47.813]  And again, I agree, I'm not against Muslims themselves.
[00:51:47.893 --> 00:51:49.174]  I'm not against Muslims either.
[00:51:49.234 --> 00:51:51.856]  Absolutely, but why do they get special treatment?
[00:51:51.896 --> 00:51:52.516]  I just don't get it.
[00:51:53.649 --> 00:51:53.970]  I don't know.
[00:51:55.253 --> 00:51:57.298]  Everybody's a protective group except the Christians.
[00:51:58.211 --> 00:51:59.572]  Any type of Christian festivity.
[00:51:59.932 --> 00:52:02.074]  If it was anything else out here, people would have no problems with it.
[00:52:02.394 --> 00:52:06.657]  We've seen in various places the satanic temples and all this stuff going on.
[00:52:06.897 --> 00:52:08.098]  These satanic holidays.
[00:52:08.719 --> 00:52:09.519]  Different things going on.
[00:52:09.559 --> 00:52:10.480]  Nobody has an issue with that.
[00:52:10.500 --> 00:52:11.641]  Nobody tries to cancel those.
[00:52:11.661 --> 00:52:11.821]  Whoa.
[00:52:11.981 --> 00:52:14.763]  But anything related to Christmas, they can't stand it.
[00:52:15.063 --> 00:52:16.184]  Whoa, Jakari.
[00:52:16.464 --> 00:52:16.924]  Whoa.
[00:52:17.145 --> 00:52:18.646]  I am so freaked out right now.
[00:52:18.706 --> 00:52:23.209]  I'm gonna skip this network break and you can go across the street and try to talk to some of the folks on the Capitol grounds.
[00:52:23.609 --> 00:52:24.130]  Jakari.
[00:52:25.111 --> 00:52:35.834]  They just cancelled the Christmas tree, the Christmas tree lighting, and the governor has, in California, cancelled it because of the mass shooting, believing it may be offensive and trigger more Muslims.
[00:52:36.274 --> 00:52:38.015]  It is now the Christmas tree's fault.
[00:52:38.075 --> 00:52:41.496]  This is the Sacramento Beach Jakari, on screen for TV viewers.
[00:52:41.816 --> 00:52:44.617]  Radio listeners, let's put it back up and I'll give the headline out.
[00:52:44.937 --> 00:52:47.478]  Brown cancels Capitol Christmas tree lighting ceremony.
[00:52:47.798 --> 00:52:51.139]  Decision follows mass shooting Wednesday in San Bernardino.
[00:52:51.519 --> 00:52:52.979]  This is all on purpose, Jakari.
[00:52:53.019 --> 00:52:54.640]  This is running up the white flag.
[00:52:56.229 --> 00:53:00.554]  I mean it's completely ridiculous to blame anything except the individual's actions.
[00:53:00.674 --> 00:53:12.646]  Farouk and his new wife, I mean they decided to make these decisions to go out there and kill people, to throw pipe bombs at the police and all this other, it had nothing to do with Christmas or Jesus or Christmas trees or anything like that.
[00:53:12.666 --> 00:53:14.468]  But they weren't terrorists with pipe bombs though.
[00:53:15.849 --> 00:53:18.032]  Well, and that's another ridiculous thing about it, Alex.
[00:53:18.092 --> 00:53:21.177]  Even if you don't call it Islamic terror, can you at least call these guys terrorists?
[00:53:21.497 --> 00:53:32.091]  They're running around, they had a premeditated attack, they killed, I believe, 14 people, wounded several others, shooting at police officers, doing all these crazy, heinous things, and nobody wants to call them terrorists.
[00:53:32.111 --> 00:53:33.093]  That's exactly what they are.
[00:53:34.315 --> 00:53:39.977]  Well, the governor wanted to change it to holiday tree lighting, and then because of that, he's just cancelling it altogether now.
[00:53:40.477 --> 00:53:42.478]  I mean, these people aren't crazies, though.
[00:53:42.518 --> 00:53:45.019]  They want to learn to ban our speech.
[00:53:45.399 --> 00:53:50.021]  They want to set the precedent that if they can take Christmas away, they can take anything away, Jakari.
[00:53:50.041 --> 00:53:57.624]  And I don't want to hear the super hardcore Christians, the Pharisees out there, and I'm not blaming them, I get their point, saying, it's not even Christian, it's a Germanic tenenbaum.
[00:53:58.004 --> 00:54:01.106]  Yeah, you know, and it's... Look, it's not... Who cares what it is?
[00:54:01.206 --> 00:54:02.407]  We don't mean it's satanic.
[00:54:02.647 --> 00:54:03.528]  It's a pretty tree.
[00:54:03.688 --> 00:54:04.669]  We're talking about Christ.
[00:54:04.949 --> 00:54:05.950]  Lights in the sky.
[00:54:05.970 --> 00:54:09.873]  You know, the wise men, all of the nativity.
[00:54:10.133 --> 00:54:11.674]  The point is, it's under attack.
[00:54:12.195 --> 00:54:13.676]  Like, I don't even like Halloween.
[00:54:13.736 --> 00:54:14.316]  Folks know that.
[00:54:14.336 --> 00:54:15.237]  It is occultic.
[00:54:15.637 --> 00:54:16.237]  It is bad.
[00:54:17.098 --> 00:54:26.185]  But, if folks want to try to ban it on colleges because they say it's politically incorrect, we have to defend people's rights to celebrate it.
[00:54:28.186 --> 00:54:28.907]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:54:29.567 --> 00:54:32.930]  Because, as you keep saying, they keep chipping away against our free speech.
[00:54:33.171 --> 00:54:39.736]  They're telling kids on college campuses what type of politically correct costumes that they can wear, which is completely ridiculous.
[00:54:39.776 --> 00:54:47.403]  People can dress up like witches and ghouls and cut people's heads off or pretend to do that thing, but if you dress up like a cowboy, they call that racist and offensive.
[00:54:47.483 --> 00:54:48.364]  It's completely ridiculous.
[00:54:49.185 --> 00:54:51.167]  And it's designed to be as wide as possible.
[00:54:52.867 --> 00:54:53.768]  You're out there on the ground.
[00:54:53.948 --> 00:54:57.790]  You and McAdoo did this, I think, last year, and most folks said, no, leave Christmas alone.
[00:54:57.810 --> 00:54:59.812]  If you go to UT, though, they'll be more whacked out.
[00:54:59.832 --> 00:55:03.534]  Maybe go there later and compare and then see if folks want to ban Christmas.
[00:55:03.574 --> 00:55:06.036]  But now you've really got the question.
[00:55:07.056 --> 00:55:10.299]  California has banned the Christmas tree at the Capitol and the lighting now.
[00:55:10.999 --> 00:55:11.980]  It's not going ahead.
[00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:15.842]  They're not lighting it up because it must be hurtful to people.
[00:55:15.882 --> 00:55:18.644]  So say California is restricting the Christmas tree at the Capitol.
[00:55:18.944 --> 00:55:19.984]  The decision has just been made.
[00:55:20.004 --> 00:55:25.448]  Do you think it should be removed here to not hurt, I guess, radical Muslims' feelings?
[00:55:26.568 --> 00:55:28.349]  I don't see a ton of people out there, but I see some.
[00:55:28.910 --> 00:55:30.991]  Are there some folks you can probably go talk to, Jakari?
[00:55:31.391 --> 00:55:32.292]  Yeah, there's a few people.
[00:55:32.312 --> 00:55:36.616]  It's not very many people out here today, but we'll go and try to talk to the people who are on the location.
[00:55:36.796 --> 00:55:37.877]  There was a lot last time.
[00:55:37.917 --> 00:55:39.218]  Okay, go ahead and walk across the street.
[00:55:39.238 --> 00:55:40.319]  We'll come back to you in a few minutes.
[00:55:40.339 --> 00:55:41.040]  Shikari, thank you.
[00:55:41.640 --> 00:55:44.363]  Folks, I can't even deal with this anymore.
[00:55:44.643 --> 00:55:53.010]  I mean, I know it's supposed to be extreme to say ban the word father and mother, boy and girl, and ban Christmas trees, but I mean, give me a break.
[00:55:53.431 --> 00:55:55.352]  This has got to stop at some point.
[00:55:56.687 --> 00:56:03.874]  The whacked out crazies that call themselves liberals are the most twisted mentally ill people I could ever imagine.
[00:56:05.736 --> 00:56:08.238]  And everybody knows I'm not about the left-right paradigm.
[00:56:08.658 --> 00:56:09.699]  I'm a libertarian.
[00:56:10.780 --> 00:56:13.683]  I have some views you could call liberal, a lot that are called conservative.
[00:56:14.644 --> 00:56:17.186]  But under Obama, I've seen Democrats
[00:56:18.129 --> 00:56:19.012]  It's part of the plan.
[00:56:19.473 --> 00:56:20.335]  The same thing in Europe.
[00:56:20.576 --> 00:56:26.571]  This new phase of liberalism is so crazy, all I can call it is Jim Jones cult.
[00:56:28.874 --> 00:56:31.055]  I mean, you talk about Jim Jones cult.
[00:56:31.415 --> 00:56:33.235]  This is classic cult programming.
[00:56:33.675 --> 00:56:39.677]  And there's a total assault on freedom of speech, freedom of association, just normal thinking processes.
[00:56:40.057 --> 00:56:48.019]  Our children in these schools are being taught how to be mentally ill, basket cases, jumping in phantoms that don't exist while their basic freedoms are being destroyed.
[00:56:48.319 --> 00:56:50.520]  Here is a news clip about the tree.
[00:56:50.860 --> 00:56:52.620]  And they even spin it like it's no big deal.
[00:56:52.640 --> 00:56:53.941]  Like, he will now not light it.
[00:56:53.981 --> 00:56:54.941]  It will now not be lit.
[00:56:55.321 --> 00:56:57.322]  They're removing Christmas is what's happening.
[00:56:58.542 --> 00:57:02.264]  I used to hear this war on Christmas thing 15 years ago, and I was like, it's not that bad.
[00:57:02.344 --> 00:57:03.084]  No, it is.
[00:57:03.204 --> 00:57:04.225]  It is a war on Christmas.
[00:57:04.245 --> 00:57:04.685]  Here it is.
[00:57:06.726 --> 00:57:14.910]  There was this dispute, and I wonder if there's ever going to be any resolution in terms of what that dispute was about.
[00:57:15.190 --> 00:57:21.913]  I think we're going to get the details at some point, but we don't have them yet, you know, understanding, of course, that there's many dead people here.
[00:57:22.253 --> 00:57:22.513]  Triggers?
[00:57:22.533 --> 00:57:23.053]  It was terrorism!
[00:57:51.926 --> 00:57:55.329]  Was there something that caused that plan to happen yesterday?
[00:57:55.349 --> 00:57:57.931]  Or was that something that was going to happen?
[00:57:58.011 --> 00:58:02.574]  So now until we forget about this, they're gonna spin it that they don't know if it's terror until we forget.
[00:58:02.594 --> 00:58:04.256]  That's just what they do.
[00:58:05.499 --> 00:58:13.221]  Let's go back to Jakari Jackson, who is in front of the Texas Capitol down there on a windy, chilly day.
[00:58:13.281 --> 00:58:14.182]  Beautiful day out there.
[00:58:14.202 --> 00:58:15.102]  Wish I was out there with him.
[00:58:15.122 --> 00:58:18.803]  And maybe he can walk over and talk to some of those folks sitting having a picnic.
[00:58:19.183 --> 00:58:21.204]  Jakari Jackson, great job down there on the ground.
[00:58:21.224 --> 00:58:22.664]  I know you're about to shoot a person on the street.
[00:58:23.044 --> 00:58:31.527]  You're about to cover the whole situation with the lawsuit over the migrants, over the refugees, and more.
[00:58:31.587 --> 00:58:33.208]  And we'll see you back for the nightly news tonight.
[00:58:33.248 --> 00:58:34.288]  Jakari Jackson, thank you.
[00:58:35.132 --> 00:58:35.322]  Thank you.
[00:58:48.809 --> 00:58:49.970]  Knockout is back.
[00:58:50.310 --> 00:59:01.414]  If you want a product that has 10 known ingredients that naturally get your body to relax, your brain to relax, so you get deep, restful sleep, Knockout's it.
[00:59:01.815 --> 00:59:03.515]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:59:04.055 --> 00:59:13.139]  L-theanine, hops flower extract, lemon balm extract, valerian root extract, chamomile flower extract, L-tryptophan extract, melatonin, and more.
[00:59:13.539 --> 00:59:15.320]  All organic, all the natural sources.
[00:59:15.880 --> 00:59:16.741]  It's the same price
[00:59:17.461 --> 00:59:23.364]  As leading brands of melatonin that are three milligrams a piece, it has three milligram, the standard recommended dose for an adult.
[00:59:23.904 --> 00:59:30.148]  It's got the GABA, so it would probably cost $50 to take all this as separate pills.
[00:59:30.648 --> 00:59:30.768]  It's $19.95.
[00:59:31.488 --> 00:59:33.830]  You take one or two of these,
[00:59:34.930 --> 00:59:38.212]  And it just is really clean restful sleep is what the reviews are.
[00:59:38.553 --> 00:59:42.435]  It's what I've experienced and it just synergistically puts everything in there.
