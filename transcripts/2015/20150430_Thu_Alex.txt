[00:00:01.097 --> 00:00:03.686]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:17.191]  Big Brother.
[00:00:17.871 --> 00:00:18.892]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:19.633 --> 00:00:20.734]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:21.395 --> 00:00:22.195]  You want answers?
[00:00:22.976 --> 00:00:23.897]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:24.518 --> 00:00:28.141]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:28.722 --> 00:00:32.786]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:35.146 --> 00:00:42.172]  Major developments as global stock indexes from Asia and North America drop on news of slowing U.S.
[00:00:42.252 --> 00:00:44.574]  and worldwide GDP.
[00:00:45.795 --> 00:00:50.499]  Former Congressman Ron Paul is going to be joining us to talk about this and a lot more today.
[00:00:50.519 --> 00:00:53.841]  I remember having Percy Smizer on, one of the famous farmers.
[00:00:54.602 --> 00:01:02.105]  Like 15 years ago that was battling Monsanto, contaminating his crops and then suing him for having their plants on his property.
[00:01:02.765 --> 00:01:10.928]  He and others said the word was they were paying farmers next to them to plant the crops and even sneak into their fields to contaminate them.
[00:01:11.408 --> 00:01:15.950]  Now Monsanto has been caught red-handed doing just that.
[00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:19.471]  Because it's a military operation.
[00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:23.131]  They've been caught doing this in the third world as well.
[00:01:23.571 --> 00:01:25.291]  We're going to be going over all of that.
[00:01:26.492 --> 00:01:29.953]  We've got the latest from the situation in Baltimore.
[00:01:32.514 --> 00:01:39.656]  We now have mainstream media promoting the summer of rage and asking is martial law what's needed.
[00:01:39.676 --> 00:01:40.656]  We're going to be going over that.
[00:01:41.436 --> 00:01:43.417]  And four days or three days after
[00:01:44.901 --> 00:01:50.205]  We began to point out that it was a stand down by the mayor, and by the police chief, and by the sheriff.
[00:01:52.526 --> 00:02:00.051]  Now Fox News has come out and said Baltimore Mayor ordered police to stand down and let them loot, and police have come out and said they were ordered to do that.
[00:02:01.372 --> 00:02:04.234]  So there you go, the conspiracy theorists were right yet again.
[00:02:04.254 --> 00:02:08.236]  Well, we're not conspiracy theorists, we saw what happened in the stand down.
[00:02:08.777 --> 00:02:11.278]  It's been done before, it's a tactic to get things out of hand.
[00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.493]  This woman works for the Justice Department and Obama, basically.
[00:02:16.254 --> 00:02:24.944]  And Obama's running around saying that we need to basically blame the police, generally, and the police departments must hold officers accountable.
[00:02:25.685 --> 00:02:33.494]  But now we're learning that the poor gentleman who got beaten to death was basically attacking himself, according to people that were in the paddy wagon with him.
[00:02:34.997 --> 00:02:37.217]  And all I'm saying is we don't know what happened with this case.
[00:02:37.738 --> 00:02:38.918]  Did police kill innocent people?
[00:02:38.998 --> 00:02:39.598]  Absolutely.
[00:02:40.038 --> 00:02:49.060]  Why is George Soros and Obama and the usual suspects promoting a collision course?
[00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.381]  Why are they trying to play the two sides off?
[00:02:53.901 --> 00:02:59.642]  Because the globalists live in Switzerland and Luxembourg and places like that.
[00:03:00.502 --> 00:03:04.583]  They don't care if we have a civil war in this country.
[00:03:06.192 --> 00:03:07.713]  That's why this is happening.
[00:03:10.674 --> 00:03:16.697]  We will also break down a host of other stories like the Army is testing handheld ray guns.
[00:03:16.797 --> 00:03:18.058]  Nextgov.com.
[00:03:18.498 --> 00:03:23.361]  Currently testing electricity guns for possible use against electronics on the battlefield.
[00:03:24.521 --> 00:03:28.643]  Whistleblower targeted for exposing UN troops raping children.
[00:03:29.003 --> 00:03:30.144]  New American Magazine.
[00:03:32.702 --> 00:03:37.788]  Anti-gay state rep outed by guy he was trying to pick up on Grindr.
[00:03:38.188 --> 00:03:39.129]  It's always like that.
[00:03:39.149 --> 00:03:44.074]  I mean, I don't like the whole liberal socialist gay agenda, but on the other side of the coin...
[00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:52.773]  It's these people that are always bashing folks and are obsessed with sex that you turn out or, you know, end all of it.
[00:03:52.873 --> 00:03:54.313]  It just never seems to end.
[00:03:54.894 --> 00:03:55.754]  We'll be going over that.
[00:03:55.994 --> 00:03:56.314]  U.S.
[00:03:56.374 --> 00:04:01.276]  Senator Rand Paul moves to block new net neutrality rules.
[00:04:01.736 --> 00:04:02.416]  Super news.
[00:04:02.776 --> 00:04:03.497]  That's on a Reuters.
[00:04:03.897 --> 00:04:06.958]  And I don't like Elizabeth Warren because I don't trust her.
[00:04:08.999 --> 00:04:11.039]  But she's certainly a lot classier than Hillary Clinton.
[00:04:11.059 --> 00:04:12.300]  I mean, she would be better than Hillary Clinton.
[00:04:13.433 --> 00:04:14.073]  I have to say that.
[00:04:14.133 --> 00:04:17.635]  But a lot of big globalist money's behind her, so you can tell she's bought and paid for.
[00:04:18.035 --> 00:04:24.559]  She's done major flip-flopping, but she's doing something that's sane, that's common sense, and that we need to hear more of.
[00:04:24.819 --> 00:04:29.021]  And she's calling on Obama to declassify the trade deal.
[00:04:29.741 --> 00:04:39.066]  We've only got one of the 30-plus parts that WikiLeaks released on the internet, and it makes SOPA and CISPA look like pro-internet, pro-freedom of speech, pro-First Amendment operations.
[00:04:39.106 --> 00:04:40.226]  I mean, this is creepy.
[00:04:40.667 --> 00:04:42.868]  That's coming up today as well.
[00:04:44.415 --> 00:04:45.316]  As I mentioned, U.S.
[00:04:45.336 --> 00:04:47.278]  stocks drop as GDP comes in weak.
[00:04:47.838 --> 00:04:54.604]  And then... There were over 365... I even have a screenshot.
[00:04:54.624 --> 00:04:56.606]  If you go to Google, type in Alex Jones, Jade Helm.
[00:04:56.646 --> 00:04:57.907]  It's 365 articles.
[00:04:59.648 --> 00:05:00.949]  Attacking us yesterday.
[00:05:00.969 --> 00:05:03.532]  ABC News, CBS Nightly News, you name it.
[00:05:03.952 --> 00:05:05.814]  Running a giant PSYOP hoax.
[00:05:06.254 --> 00:05:08.056]  And attacking Governor Abbott of Texas.
[00:05:10.478 --> 00:05:16.200]  Presidential wannabe Hillary Clinton blamed the Baltimore riots on income inequality and race.
[00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:24.603]  But what's really to blame in Baltimore, and what Clinton failed to address, are the Democratic policies that have plagued the city for half a century.
[00:05:24.823 --> 00:05:26.923]  Democrats run the city of Baltimore.
[00:05:27.103 --> 00:05:30.264]  The unions, the schools, and yes, the police force.
[00:05:30.625 --> 00:05:34.726]  The city has been effectively a single party political monopoly for decades.
[00:05:34.946 --> 00:05:44.350]  That's years of bad government policies that have been particularly destructive to any opportunity for employment and stability that are key to lifting its citizens out of poverty.
[00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:51.293]  And while lucrative for the ruling party's cronies, cradle-to-grave welfare is crippling to the people it alleges to help.
[00:05:51.633 --> 00:05:57.579]  Cities ruled by Democrats have become the hardest places in America to launch a business or hire someone.
[00:05:57.819 --> 00:06:03.184]  It's the liberal policies that have turned another once great American city into a war zone.

[00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:27.494]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[00:06:27.834 --> 00:06:32.516]  We have now managed to secure these sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.

[00:08:40.063 --> 00:08:41.864]  2015 worldwide broadcast.
[00:08:42.864 --> 00:08:43.665]  It is Thursday.
[00:08:45.285 --> 00:09:04.415]  Congressman Ron Paul, former congressman and medical doctor Ron Paul, father of Senator Rand Paul, major presidential candidate contender, will be joining us coming up for about 25 minutes at the start of the second hour today and I have a host of issues to raise with him, including Jade Helm.
[00:09:06.570 --> 00:09:14.318]  I'm going to cover other news first, but at the bottom of the hour, I'm going to get into the latest chapter in the Jade Helm saga.
[00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:26.890]  Two days ago, newly elected, and now in office, no longer governor-elect, but governor, Abbott
[00:09:28.715 --> 00:09:38.065]  came out and said Texans are concerned about federalization and I will have the State Guard there monitoring Jade Helm.
[00:09:38.105 --> 00:09:38.966]  Well, of course he will.
[00:09:39.346 --> 00:09:43.610]  It's being run out of one of the State Guard's main headquarters, Camp Swift.
[00:09:46.954 --> 00:09:48.175]  And they've had Bloomberg
[00:09:49.398 --> 00:09:54.684]  AP Reuters 365 articles yesterday.
[00:09:54.704 --> 00:10:06.276]  You go to Google, type in Alex Jones Jade Helm and then click see more stories or explore in depth and it's 365 articles.
[00:10:06.817 --> 00:10:08.519]  That's just with my name in it.
[00:10:09.389 --> 00:10:15.934]  If you search it with Jade Helm as of this morning, it was over a thousand articles in the last two days.
[00:10:16.834 --> 00:10:22.078]  And those are just saying conspiracy theorists are in for wars.
[00:10:22.098 --> 00:10:36.528]  365 naming me and saying you can read the articles that Governor Abbott and Alex Jones believe there will be a martial law takeover by Obama this summer.
[00:10:37.694 --> 00:10:38.635]  I never said that.
[00:10:39.095 --> 00:10:40.596]  The governor never said that.
[00:10:41.036 --> 00:10:42.197]  They don't have that.
[00:10:42.677 --> 00:10:49.221]  It's a stinking lie by a pack of scum lying to their readers.
[00:10:49.522 --> 00:10:50.342]  Preying on them.
[00:10:51.643 --> 00:10:52.423]  Preying on them.
[00:10:53.124 --> 00:10:54.465]  Look at this headline out of Salon.
[00:10:55.045 --> 00:10:58.367]  Right-wing lunatics think the military is planning to invade Texas.
[00:10:58.707 --> 00:10:59.248]  Here's why.
[00:11:01.818 --> 00:11:02.798]  Woe if true!
[00:11:02.978 --> 00:11:07.319]  Operation Jade Helm 15 lays groundwork for martial law.
[00:11:07.339 --> 00:11:09.940]  Awesome American statesmen.
[00:11:10.380 --> 00:11:11.580]  The Americans are coming.
[00:11:11.620 --> 00:11:12.660]  The Americans are coming.
[00:11:12.961 --> 00:11:17.001]  The Jade Helm, Greg Abbott, Alex Jones, and the politics of paranoia.
[00:11:18.242 --> 00:11:23.563]  Six times in here they call us lunatics in just one article.
[00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:29.722]  Texas militia to monitor federal troops during Jade Helm military exercises.
[00:11:30.142 --> 00:11:32.383]  Governor deploys troops to guard against martial law.
[00:11:35.005 --> 00:11:39.527]  That's how this is being spied.
[00:11:39.547 --> 00:11:43.449]  365 of them yesterday with my name in it.
[00:11:43.910 --> 00:11:45.351]  Over a hundred today.
[00:11:45.391 --> 00:11:47.772]  You can time search them.
[00:11:49.204 --> 00:11:59.970]  CBS Nightly News, ABC Nightly News, NBC Nightly News, CNN, MSNBC, all attacked us last night.
[00:12:00.870 --> 00:12:01.371]  By name.
[00:12:04.052 --> 00:12:06.073]  I had people on the street asking about it this morning.
[00:12:06.353 --> 00:12:10.576]  Folks at the gym, family calling me from East Texas.
[00:12:13.766 --> 00:12:14.486]  Saying, really?
[00:12:14.846 --> 00:12:15.767]  Martial Law's coming?
[00:12:15.887 --> 00:12:19.468]  Believing it's coming, because I have so much credibility with people.
[00:12:19.488 --> 00:12:21.849]  And I'm like, no, Martial Law's not coming.
[00:12:22.169 --> 00:12:22.849]  I didn't say that.
[00:12:23.489 --> 00:12:25.570]  This is how the PSYOP works.
[00:12:26.390 --> 00:12:40.795]  They say I cried wolf, so that when Open Martial Law doesn't happen this summer, they'll say, see, with a bunch of stories at the end of Jade Helm, by September, saying Jones said Martial Law and it didn't happen.
[00:12:43.683 --> 00:12:45.044]  I'll cover this more at the bottom of the hour.
[00:12:45.064 --> 00:12:46.304]  I pretty much am already covering it.
[00:12:46.405 --> 00:12:50.807]  It's just so frustrating to see these lines come.
[00:12:50.867 --> 00:12:51.968]  And here's what's interesting.
[00:12:53.448 --> 00:13:01.753]  You know when the directive talking points come out of the White House and the Pentagon because it's the exact same talking points in 365 articles.
[00:13:02.373 --> 00:13:05.755]  I just showed the 365 articles on screen of your TV viewer.
[00:13:07.056 --> 00:13:08.457]  And that's just the ones we can find.
[00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:14.203]  This is how they operate.
[00:13:14.443 --> 00:13:15.364]  Dallas Observer.
[00:13:16.005 --> 00:13:18.567]  Abbott engages in tinfoil hatters.
[00:13:19.508 --> 00:13:21.831]  Will send Texas Guard to watch for martial law.
[00:13:22.592 --> 00:13:23.613]  Dallas Morning News.
[00:13:23.793 --> 00:13:25.075]  In fact, I got screenshots of it.
[00:13:25.095 --> 00:13:28.759]  If you go to the comments, it goes, I'm so ashamed of the redneck scum that live in Texas.
[00:13:28.979 --> 00:13:30.060]  I want to get out of this state.
[00:13:31.662 --> 00:13:33.204]  And the article says that the governor
[00:13:36.187 --> 00:13:42.012]  And Alex Jones believed that there's going to be troops arresting us and taking our guns this summer.
[00:13:42.593 --> 00:13:43.313]  I never said it.
[00:13:43.393 --> 00:13:44.414]  The governor never said it.
[00:13:45.355 --> 00:13:46.936]  And we're not backtracking here.
[00:13:46.956 --> 00:13:48.057]  They don't have us on our heels.
[00:13:48.478 --> 00:13:55.544]  We're on the offense, aware of what's going on, aware that this is part of a conditioning long-term program of federalization.
[00:13:55.784 --> 00:13:57.305]  Who can deny they're federalizing police?
[00:13:57.525 --> 00:14:01.369]  Who can deny they're TSA checkpoints in every major city of Texas now illegally?
[00:14:02.148 --> 00:14:05.542]  We had to have lawsuits get filed in Houston and Dallas to stop it.
[00:14:05.904 --> 00:14:07.350]  Who can deny there's federally funded...
[00:14:08.812 --> 00:14:17.498]  Knock and talk, where the cops come to your door and ask if they can inspect your guns in wealthy areas of Boston and Dallas and in LA.
[00:14:17.558 --> 00:14:19.000]  I mean, it's nationwide.
[00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:28.206]  Who can deny that hundreds of thousands of veterans every few months get a call or a SWAT team raid, depending, and have their guns taken, no judge, no jury.
[00:14:28.506 --> 00:14:32.810]  Who can deny the NSA is spying illegally against every American, now confirmed?
[00:14:33.510 --> 00:14:34.230]  Declassified.
[00:14:34.810 --> 00:14:35.090]  Leaked.
[00:14:35.671 --> 00:14:47.694]  Who can deny the president outside of law, didn't even sign an order, just did it, opened the borders up, January of last, of this year.
[00:14:50.115 --> 00:14:50.755]  Who can deny it?
[00:14:53.216 --> 00:14:55.277]  That was January of last year, my god, time's flying.
[00:14:56.417 --> 00:14:57.898]  Who can deny?
[00:14:57.918 --> 00:15:02.319]  I mean, it's head-spinning what's going on.
[00:15:03.632 --> 00:15:08.079]  Congress, six years ago, wouldn't pass this carbon tax to shut down over a thousand power plants.
[00:15:08.319 --> 00:15:09.180]  He just did it!
[00:15:09.841 --> 00:15:13.126]  And gave his buddies, General Electric, total waivers.
[00:15:13.407 --> 00:15:14.889]  Do you know what General Electric did?
[00:15:15.349 --> 00:15:18.374]  We have clean burning coal here that supplies half our power or more, and now it supplies like 30%?
[00:15:21.277 --> 00:15:27.539]  They moved and set up hundreds of new plants in Mexico with no scrubbers, totally dirty, spewing pure mercury out the top.
[00:15:28.379 --> 00:15:33.761]  And then that's what supplies the four states around Texas, when Texas used to be independent and supplied four states.
[00:15:34.442 --> 00:15:36.242]  We're under economic war.
[00:15:36.822 --> 00:15:43.705]  Outside of law, they built, over a decade, the first new oil refinery in the U.S.
[00:15:43.845 --> 00:15:44.205]  since the 1980s.
[00:15:44.225 --> 00:15:45.946]  $3.3 billion in Corpus Christi.
[00:15:53.368 --> 00:15:57.290]  Obama never allowed it to be open, so we'd have cheaper gas.
[00:16:00.491 --> 00:16:04.173]  Pipelines that would bring in more oil, drive down prices, shut down.
[00:16:05.214 --> 00:16:06.234]  Finished pipelines.
[00:16:08.755 --> 00:16:14.578]  Every lead smelting operation has been shut down in the last six years.
[00:16:14.618 --> 00:16:17.180]  The last one closed middle of 2014, eight months ago.
[00:16:20.936 --> 00:16:23.604]  We are under total shutdown right now.
[00:16:24.165 --> 00:16:25.630]  We're under economic siege.
[00:16:25.870 --> 00:16:27.555]  We're under a soft martial law.
[00:16:28.419 --> 00:16:38.881]  If the stove goes up to twelve, they're at about a six, a seven, and they're just turning it up real slow, and the frog's going, man, this hot tub's getting a little painful, but boy, maybe I'll just pass out.
[00:16:39.181 --> 00:16:44.602]  Maybe I'll just lean back and let my eyes roll back in my head, and I'm jumping up and down as another frog going, get out, get out, get out, get out!
[00:16:44.622 --> 00:16:49.443]  And there's a little weasel by the pot going, don't listen to him, it's a hot tub, it's a country club.
[00:16:49.923 --> 00:16:53.944]  See, he says you'll be boiling in two seconds, but you won't be boiling in two seconds.
[00:16:54.324 --> 00:16:55.364]  More like five minutes.
[00:16:56.745 --> 00:16:57.825]  Which is more like five years.
[00:16:59.505 --> 00:17:00.746]  I'm like, get out of there, get out of there.
[00:17:00.766 --> 00:17:01.506]  He's turning the heat up.
[00:17:01.626 --> 00:17:02.146]  It's a weasel!
[00:17:02.347 --> 00:17:02.847]  It's a weasel!
[00:17:03.667 --> 00:17:04.408]  I'm not a weasel!
[00:17:04.568 --> 00:17:05.668]  Don't listen to that frog!
[00:17:05.908 --> 00:17:06.509]  Listen to me!
[00:17:06.529 --> 00:17:09.891]  I mean, it's ridiculous.
[00:17:09.911 --> 00:17:11.231]  These are known liars.
[00:17:11.992 --> 00:17:18.715]  And when we cover Jade Helm, Joe Biggs ran in here over a month ago, during the break, and he goes, look at this Jade Helm.
[00:17:18.775 --> 00:17:19.315]  It's army.mil.
[00:17:20.896 --> 00:17:21.517]  I called them.
[00:17:22.419 --> 00:17:23.822]  I called some sources of the military.
[00:17:23.842 --> 00:17:25.987]  You know, they said it's supposed to be restricted.
[00:17:26.367 --> 00:17:27.029]  Blah, blah, blah.
[00:17:27.049 --> 00:17:28.151]  Can I come on here and talk about it?
[00:17:28.171 --> 00:17:30.315]  I said, yeah, that's a major military exercise.
[00:17:30.355 --> 00:17:31.718]  We always cover big exercises.
[00:17:33.038 --> 00:17:34.519]  Mainstream media coverage exercises.
[00:17:34.579 --> 00:17:36.279]  We go, look, Texas is hostile in it.
[00:17:36.539 --> 00:17:39.360]  Look, it says they'll be operating domestically and working with locals and police.
[00:17:39.820 --> 00:17:40.901]  This is more of the same.
[00:17:41.121 --> 00:17:43.682]  Here's a bunch of other drills where they try to take our guns.
[00:17:44.022 --> 00:17:45.463]  And here's where they really did it in Katrina.
[00:17:45.903 --> 00:17:47.303]  Wow, we better look at this.
[00:17:47.323 --> 00:17:51.705]  Now, they're going to show dirty bomb drills and reasonable stuff and say we're discredited.
[00:17:51.725 --> 00:17:53.645]  And then they're going to say that we're saying it's martial law.
[00:17:53.906 --> 00:17:55.166]  They're going to take over this summer.
[00:17:55.446 --> 00:17:56.607]  That's not what we're saying.
[00:17:57.667 --> 00:17:58.627]  But that'll be the PSYOP.
[00:17:58.887 --> 00:18:00.188]  And then that's exactly what they did.
[00:18:01.178 --> 00:18:08.387]  And you can go back to those exact reports over a month ago, and see Joe in here, and then see the follow-up reports, because they follow a script.
[00:18:08.687 --> 00:18:14.314]  When you've got thousands of newspapers the last few months attacking us, every, basically every TV station in the country.
[00:18:14.594 --> 00:18:17.678]  There are five TV stations in Austin, including local Telemundo.
[00:18:18.219 --> 00:18:20.161]  I'm told I was attacked on that this weekend.
[00:18:21.078 --> 00:18:29.947]  My lawyer called me and he said he basically saw me in the paper every day in the last five days, I don't even read the local paper, and that I've been all over the news.
[00:18:30.368 --> 00:18:40.298]  I mean, they are on there saying, Jones says Obama's coming with troops this summer to take your guns, and then when it doesn't happen, people who are weak-minded will believe... I'll just cover Jade Helm now.
[00:18:40.558 --> 00:18:41.179]  I'll get to all of the news.
[00:18:42.759 --> 00:18:43.800]  The weak-minded will think.
[00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:44.841]  Never saw me say it.
[00:18:45.361 --> 00:18:46.602]  Yeah, that's that Alex Jones.
[00:18:46.642 --> 00:18:47.623]  He said martial law was coming.
[00:18:48.084 --> 00:18:49.585]  Oh, look, there's an armored vehicle just rolled by.
[00:18:49.625 --> 00:18:50.486]  Oh, look, there's cameras.
[00:18:50.526 --> 00:18:51.647]  Oh, look, license plate readers.
[00:18:52.027 --> 00:18:53.909]  Oh, look, police checkpoints.
[00:18:54.670 --> 00:18:56.752]  Oh, look, I did see an army drill.
[00:18:56.772 --> 00:18:59.934]  There were some troops walking down the street, but I'm not in martial law.
[00:18:59.954 --> 00:19:03.177]  Because they'll never call it that.
[00:19:03.457 --> 00:19:06.620]  You're already in a level 6 on a scale to 12.
[00:19:09.884 --> 00:19:11.345]  Or seven, martial law.
[00:19:12.045 --> 00:19:16.366]  When they take your money out of your bank with no judge, no jury, no nothing.
[00:19:16.407 --> 00:19:18.827]  Now at the IRS, the New York Times admits it, nobody gets in trouble.
[00:19:19.768 --> 00:19:24.270]  When 40 million illegals are here getting free everything outside of law, but citizens get nothing.
[00:19:25.290 --> 00:19:28.171]  When 100 million people are on welfare, and it's growing.
[00:19:28.591 --> 00:19:32.433]  When the government's openly announcing they're going to start raising taxes outside of law.
[00:19:33.712 --> 00:19:44.257]  That was on ABC Nightly News, like Sunday night, I would turn on television and it was just, the President's doing what he has to to help America, acting executively because Congress won't do its job.
[00:19:44.637 --> 00:19:49.659]  It's all just phrase like, well, the Fuhrer is acting because the Reichstag won't do its job.
[00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:53.021]  We're living in the Twilight Zone here!
[00:19:56.042 --> 00:19:57.303]  We're living in crazy town.
[00:19:58.692 --> 00:20:00.835]  So, we're already in a police state.
[00:20:01.256 --> 00:20:02.778]  We're going deeper into one.
[00:20:03.219 --> 00:20:05.262]  They've got military drills to take on the people.
[00:20:05.523 --> 00:20:09.348]  We've got countless videos of the police admitting the MRAPs are for the veterans, okay?
[00:20:09.669 --> 00:20:09.989]  Period!

[00:23:24.173 --> 00:23:25.473]  She built the gun herself.
[00:23:25.613 --> 00:23:27.013]  Mark's mom is pretty awesome.

[00:24:52.190 --> 00:24:56.952]  This is in preparation for the financial collapse and maybe even Obama not leaving office.
[00:24:57.032 --> 00:24:58.572]  I mean, I'm telling you, this is so huge.
[00:24:58.893 --> 00:25:05.615]  Online, there is no shortage of people who think Jade Helm 15 is masking something insidious.
[00:25:05.995 --> 00:25:12.598]  One thing is for sure, troops will be ready and trained to take over your town when it happens.
[00:25:12.818 --> 00:25:16.439]  They're preparing to initiate martial law and maybe even roundups.
[00:25:16.479 --> 00:25:18.780]  This is not a joke.
[00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:20.481]  It's the real deal.
[00:25:21.261 --> 00:25:25.967]  The Army tells CBS News the operation has nothing to do with martial law.
[00:25:25.987 --> 00:25:31.072]  Many of the exercises will take place in remote areas, away from the public.
[00:25:31.533 --> 00:25:42.365]  But after this map of the training exercises surfaced, which identified Texas, Utah, and Southern California as hostile territory, the conspiracy theories took off.
[00:25:42.785 --> 00:25:46.647]  My friends, this is a declaration of war on United States soil.
[00:25:47.147 --> 00:25:48.588]  This is in our backyard.
[00:25:48.788 --> 00:25:52.470]  Even plumbing repairs at several Walmart stores drew suspicion.
[00:25:52.890 --> 00:25:56.652]  Walmart closing stores across the nation.
[00:25:58.057 --> 00:26:03.440]  Most of them, if not all, are in the Jade Helm exercise vicinity.
[00:26:03.580 --> 00:26:08.522]  Jade Helm truly is just a training exercise to prepare Army Special Operations Forces.
[00:26:08.542 --> 00:26:10.443]  Alright, let's stop there.
[00:26:10.703 --> 00:26:13.204]  The full report is going up on InfoWars.com.
[00:26:13.284 --> 00:26:16.425]  It's ABC News, CNN, I can't even track it all.
[00:26:17.786 --> 00:26:19.907]  And notice they took a little five second clip.
[00:26:22.082 --> 00:26:33.668]  Of not where I say this will be martial law this summer, but that it could be preparation for Obama to stay in office after a financial collapse, which mainline analysts are saying could happen any time.
[00:26:34.068 --> 00:26:37.030]  How did Roosevelt stay in office?
[00:26:37.110 --> 00:26:41.893]  I mean, I used to tell people six years ago that said Obama was planning to stay in office, that they were wrong.
[00:26:42.173 --> 00:26:42.993]  He was just a puppet.
[00:26:43.554 --> 00:26:49.657]  Except now, no president, even Lincoln, didn't act this unilaterally on the entire country.
[00:26:50.831 --> 00:26:52.252]  The borders are wide open.
[00:26:52.593 --> 00:26:56.796]  The Border Patrol pays with vouchers to ship the illegals and their families in.
[00:26:57.537 --> 00:27:08.566]  They're handing out millions of green cards and social security numbers, and with those, driver's license to vote, and ordering the Border Patrol and federal police to let illegals be above the law.
[00:27:09.046 --> 00:27:11.328]  My point is, that's illegal.
[00:27:11.809 --> 00:27:14.992]  That's a government that's rogue, doing whatever it wants.
[00:27:15.692 --> 00:27:17.493]  The same government that staged Fast and Furious.
[00:27:17.834 --> 00:27:20.595]  The same government using the IRS to persecute Christians.
[00:27:21.676 --> 00:27:26.519]  Nixon had to step down over stuff literally one-one-thousandth.
[00:27:26.619 --> 00:27:28.020]  And Nixon should have.
[00:27:28.761 --> 00:27:30.242]  I'm not a tricky-dicky promoter here.
[00:27:32.483 --> 00:27:37.186]  But it's just exponentially worse.
[00:27:37.607 --> 00:27:39.328]  It's over the top.
[00:27:40.916 --> 00:27:46.317]  And you've got this whole atmosphere of surveillance and tyranny and executive power grabbing.
[00:27:47.768 --> 00:27:49.649]  And it's the public that's concerned.
[00:27:49.810 --> 00:27:50.410]  The public.
[00:27:50.450 --> 00:27:50.830]  And you know what?
[00:27:50.850 --> 00:27:55.094]  That's healthy that when Obama tries to ban semi-autos, everybody goes out and buys them.
[00:27:55.594 --> 00:27:59.457]  It's healthy that people don't believe known liars like Bloomberg.
[00:28:00.077 --> 00:28:13.428]  It's healthy that when the military is going to bring in thousands of special forces and tens of thousands of support forces and spend billions of dollars, quote, blending in and working with locals,
[00:28:14.841 --> 00:28:19.884]  And then we have the training going on all over the country by Marines, by Army, by National Guard.
[00:28:19.924 --> 00:28:20.865]  Do I need to play it again?
[00:28:21.685 --> 00:28:22.786]  What are these MRAPs for?
[00:28:22.826 --> 00:28:25.107]  They're for the patriots, the gun owners, and the veterans.
[00:28:25.448 --> 00:28:26.488]  What do the manuals say?
[00:28:26.748 --> 00:28:28.309]  Patriots, gun owners, and veterans.
[00:28:28.489 --> 00:28:29.510]  In fact, let me correct things.
[00:28:30.251 --> 00:28:31.791]  Veterans are the number one enemy.
[00:28:32.332 --> 00:28:36.334]  Gun owners, conservatives, libertarians, Christians.
[00:28:37.115 --> 00:28:39.316]  That's what the document says!
[00:28:39.836 --> 00:28:43.659]  I mean, I've got Fort Hood commanding general last year.
[00:28:46.385 --> 00:28:49.967]  Saying, founding fathers would not be welcome in today's military.
[00:28:51.407 --> 00:29:02.432]  And then just last week, or two weeks ago, there was all these mainstream news articles where it said, Constitution founders, sexist and racist, and they teach that in the army.
[00:29:04.572 --> 00:29:07.794]  I mean, they don't train to fight Russians or ISIS!
[00:29:09.281 --> 00:29:26.094]  They train to fight the patriots, the Americans, the veterans, and they just... Notice they show all these different alternative news media clips like we're kooks, but the background are the documents where it says they're trying to take on gun owners, where it says they're trying to take on the Tea Party.
[00:29:27.315 --> 00:29:27.716]  There it is.
[00:29:28.956 --> 00:29:31.477]  That's out of, I think I want to get Tucker Carlson on about all this.
[00:29:31.497 --> 00:29:32.717]  I haven't had him on in a while.
[00:29:33.217 --> 00:29:36.298]  Defense Department, this is out of the Daily Caller that he runs, he owns.
[00:29:36.678 --> 00:29:41.439]  The Bible, Constitution, and Declaration of Independence all perpetuate sexism.
[00:29:42.179 --> 00:29:46.820]  And then you read the Army Training Manual and it actually says it's racist too, you know.
[00:29:47.620 --> 00:29:51.121]  But meanwhile that colonel gets up in Bastrop and goes, you see my uniform?
[00:29:51.281 --> 00:29:52.422]  It goes back to George Washington.
[00:29:52.642 --> 00:29:53.362]  You trust it.
[00:29:54.542 --> 00:29:58.483]  The people running our military now say that is the opposite of our army.
[00:29:59.946 --> 00:30:02.968]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:30:03.868 --> 00:30:06.630]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:10.612 --> 00:30:21.159]  As protests over police brutality erupt across the nation, I'm reminded of this passage from the Capitalist Conspiracy Booklet, written by G. Edward Griffin in 1971.
[00:30:21.479 --> 00:30:28.523]  If those who seek world dominion can stimulate leftist mobs into violent confrontation with local law enforcement,
[00:30:28.723 --> 00:30:35.065]  And also provide exhaustive news coverage so that the entire nation can see and tremble.
[00:30:35.246 --> 00:30:46.850]  Then the peaceful and freedom-loving majority can be programmed to accept a vast expansion of government powers and even a national police force offered supposedly to end the violence.
[00:30:47.210 --> 00:30:50.291]  We're witnessing that same old Hegelian dialectic today.
[00:30:50.492 --> 00:31:00.916]  By stimulating unrest and allowing it to spiral out of control, the federal government can offer itself up as the solution, sacrificing ourselves for the King's nefarious takeover plan.
[00:31:01.136 --> 00:31:02.237]  Join the revolution.

[00:33:36.078 --> 00:33:39.079]  Monday through Friday, 11 a.m.
[00:33:39.119 --> 00:33:40.279]  to 2 p.m.
[00:33:41.039 --> 00:33:43.080]  Central, we're here live.
[00:33:55.359 --> 00:33:58.561]  We return weeknight, 7 o'clock Central, InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:33:59.081 --> 00:34:00.903]  And then Sundays, I return live.
[00:34:01.223 --> 00:34:03.564]  I'll be live this Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:34:04.085 --> 00:34:08.307]  Central Standard Time in studio, as I was last Sunday.
[00:34:08.367 --> 00:34:09.548]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:34:10.509 --> 00:34:13.631]  Here's what it really boils down to in the final equation.
[00:34:15.029 --> 00:34:28.099]  There is a planetary war against individual freedom, a planetary war against individual capital, not controlled by a global crime syndicate gang combine of robber baron thug bankers.
[00:34:30.131 --> 00:34:31.932]  And they've all written books, basically.
[00:34:31.972 --> 00:34:33.573]  They're all public about their plan.
[00:34:33.993 --> 00:34:35.914]  Senator Barry Goldwater exposed them.
[00:34:36.375 --> 00:34:37.735]  Ron Paul exposed them.
[00:34:37.815 --> 00:34:39.256]  Ronald Reagan exposed them.
[00:34:39.817 --> 00:34:44.279]  When he was running for president, you can pull up those videos of Reagan talking about the Trilateral Commission.
[00:34:44.719 --> 00:34:47.201]  This was mainline Republican Party politics.
[00:34:47.921 --> 00:34:52.484]  But the mainline media beat the Republicans into submission.
[00:34:53.749 --> 00:35:03.631]  Demonize the John Birch Society in about eight or nine of the thirty or so articles I scanned over attacking Governor Abbott for saying, yeah, I'm concerned about Jade Helm.
[00:35:03.651 --> 00:35:04.392]  People are concerned.
[00:35:04.432 --> 00:35:07.212]  I'm going to make sure our liberties are guarded and we're not federalized.
[00:35:07.793 --> 00:35:09.633]  I'm going to send out the State Guard to monitor it.
[00:35:10.733 --> 00:35:15.775]  They go, oh, what's he sleep with the John Birch Society blue book under his pillow?
[00:35:16.915 --> 00:35:21.336]  If you read the John Birch blue book from the fifties, all of it came true.
[00:35:22.608 --> 00:35:32.916]  If you go listen to the speeches John Birch gave back in the, John Birch was tortured to death, but the founder of the John Birch Society gave, it all came true.
[00:35:33.096 --> 00:35:50.450]  I'm not a member of the John Birch Society, but I know what's going on in the world, because when I was a little kid, my parents had friends that were in the John Birch Society, guys that worked at the telephone company, FBI agents, cops, lawyers,
[00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:53.201]  That would come by the House.
[00:35:53.341 --> 00:36:03.545]  They'd basically have John Birch meetings and talk about the New World Order and the plans for the country and the three mega regions and how they transfer our liberties into foreign treaties.
[00:36:04.045 --> 00:36:06.406]  Everything that's basically 90% complete.
[00:36:09.908 --> 00:36:14.330]  And instead of getting 100 Pulitzer Prizes for what they've done, they get to have people
[00:36:18.806 --> 00:36:21.809]  Like Salon and the Austin American Statesman and Bloomberg.
[00:36:21.909 --> 00:36:31.657]  All these anti-American, knuckle-dragging, totalitarians wearing a suit of liberalism attack people that simply tell the truth.
[00:36:31.957 --> 00:36:35.501]  You know, Governor Abbott has sued more than, I don't know, it's 20-something times.
[00:36:36.522 --> 00:36:46.654]  The feds over saying, you know what, we're just going to take a couple thousand square miles of property on both sides of the Red River in Oklahoma and Texas and just federalize it.
[00:36:46.934 --> 00:36:48.396]  Abbott says, no you're not, I'm going to sue you.
[00:36:48.957 --> 00:36:52.881]  You know what, we're just going to shut down about a hundred and something Texas power plants outside of law.
[00:36:54.042 --> 00:36:54.884]  He says, we're going to sue you.
[00:36:55.164 --> 00:36:55.525]  You know what?
[00:36:55.565 --> 00:36:58.149]  We're going to shut down a bunch of ranching outside of law.
[00:36:58.510 --> 00:37:04.641]  We're just going to have the BLM show up in East Texas with no jurisdiction and not even a court ruling and say you can't use your land.
[00:37:04.881 --> 00:37:05.642]  Abbott goes, you know what?
[00:37:05.662 --> 00:37:06.304]  I'm going to sue you.
[00:37:08.134 --> 00:37:08.634]  You know what?
[00:37:08.694 --> 00:37:14.178]  We're going to just open the border up in Texas and just flood you to be bankrupted by tens of millions of illegals.
[00:37:14.558 --> 00:37:21.342]  And Abbott says, I'm going to have the state police down there arresting people that have criminal backgrounds and turning them over to you and embarrassing you.
[00:37:21.622 --> 00:37:24.444]  And I'm going to have judges come out and rule against you.
[00:37:27.506 --> 00:37:30.867]  I mean, the truth is, Abbott is quietly doing what a governor would do.
[00:37:31.087 --> 00:37:31.907]  He's not radical.
[00:37:32.267 --> 00:37:35.088]  The country is burning down around us politically.
[00:37:35.748 --> 00:37:40.229]  We're hemorrhaging out, being run onto the rocks of debt by design.
[00:37:42.089 --> 00:37:53.932]  And so, they have it in the Dallas Morning News, and they have it in all these other papers that Abbott believes that Obama is going to invade and declare martial law this summer.
[00:37:56.325 --> 00:37:57.066]  He doesn't need to do that.
[00:37:57.106 --> 00:37:58.127]  He's already in control.
[00:37:58.527 --> 00:38:05.975]  He already said, two years ago in the legislature, said, we're not going to let the TSA grope children's genitals.
[00:38:06.375 --> 00:38:09.999]  And the feds said, fine, F-16s are standing by for a blockade of the state.
[00:38:10.439 --> 00:38:12.982]  Any aircraft will be forced down or shot down.
[00:38:13.322 --> 00:38:15.364]  That was in the Associated Press.
[00:38:15.864 --> 00:38:19.168]  That's how the Civil War started, with the naval blockades.
[00:38:24.096 --> 00:38:27.857]  And they've billed Obama as this messianic leader, Lincoln too.
[00:38:29.218 --> 00:38:37.740]  And anyone that opposes total federalization, that's really globalization, is now a southern avenger.
[00:38:37.820 --> 00:38:39.101]  The South is rising again.
[00:38:39.161 --> 00:38:42.682]  Listen, I'll take a federal national government any day.
[00:38:42.902 --> 00:38:43.702]  We don't have that.
[00:38:44.062 --> 00:38:46.943]  We have a global corporate government.
[00:38:47.063 --> 00:38:48.824]  We have been taken over.
[00:38:49.824 --> 00:38:53.025]  I mean, look at Senator Elizabeth Warren.
[00:38:54.178 --> 00:38:54.518]  Today.
[00:38:54.538 --> 00:38:57.760]  Is she a conspiracy theorist?
[00:38:58.441 --> 00:38:59.901]  What do we hammer here every day?
[00:39:01.362 --> 00:39:06.025]  Senator Warren calls on Obama to declassify trade deal details.
[00:39:06.926 --> 00:39:07.406]  That's right.
[00:39:08.206 --> 00:39:10.088]  Congress isn't even allowed to see.
[00:39:11.144 --> 00:39:38.693]  The secret, 30-plus part, multi-thousand page trade deal, written over the last seven years, to create the TPP, Trans-Pacific Partnership, that makes NAFTA, at least we had a debate about NAFTA, I could see part of it, they were always changing it back in the early 90s, and now, that we know these trade deals are one-sided screw jobs for select corporations to shut down their competition, we have her at least coming out.
[00:39:42.358 --> 00:39:48.221]  And saying, remember this is an anti-gun probe and border globalist, bad news.
[00:39:48.761 --> 00:39:58.926]  But still, it's shocking and heroic that she would be saying, you need to let Congress and the people see what's in this.
[00:39:59.407 --> 00:40:01.928]  Oh my gosh, like the FCC takeover?
[00:40:02.068 --> 00:40:05.030]  Or like all these secret orders on opening the borders?
[00:40:10.586 --> 00:40:11.627]  See how far we've come?
[00:40:12.247 --> 00:40:24.316]  That secret corporate bodies are making our laws and 81% to 83% the British government admits this, of their laws are made by the EU, it's unelected?
[00:40:24.336 --> 00:40:30.881]  I had a few years ago a reporter call me and they go, you say the EU's unelected, they have a parliament.
[00:40:32.242 --> 00:40:35.705]  And I went, wow, you're a fancy journalist, you knew they had a parliament.
[00:40:35.785 --> 00:40:37.246]  I know, they'd have members of the parliament on.
[00:40:37.726 --> 00:40:39.768]  The EU Parliament, like Nigel Farage and others.
[00:40:41.397 --> 00:40:42.838]  But they're ceremonial.
[00:40:43.138 --> 00:40:46.459]  They only make recommendations to the Central Board.
[00:40:49.140 --> 00:40:52.042]  And it's run by the IMF and the World Bank, International Bank of Settlements.
[00:40:53.682 --> 00:41:06.768]  Just like the TPP, and the NAU, and the TPP, and the Trans-Texas Corridor, and all the rest of it.
[00:41:08.550 --> 00:41:28.398]  You know the treaty to bring us into the NAU is still secret after it was signed in 2005 in Waco, Texas by Vicente Fox, Paul Martin, and George Herbert, Walker Bush's son, George W. The average reporter out there can't tell you who was president of Mexico in 2005 or who was the Prime Minister of Canada.
[00:41:28.798 --> 00:41:32.660]  See, the truth is we're like gods compared to these lazy reporters.
[00:41:32.880 --> 00:41:34.120]  And I'm not saying I'm like a god.
[00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:35.801]  I'm a pathetic creature.
[00:41:37.318 --> 00:41:39.439]  The point is, we are light years ahead of them.
[00:41:39.699 --> 00:41:41.179]  But see, we're not like the globalists.
[00:41:41.219 --> 00:41:42.399]  They're light years ahead, too.
[00:41:43.560 --> 00:41:44.780]  They can name all the people.
[00:41:44.940 --> 00:41:46.300]  They can name the players, because they're running it.
[00:41:47.881 --> 00:41:48.641]  They want to name them.
[00:41:48.861 --> 00:41:50.501]  They want to know it, because they run the show.
[00:41:50.781 --> 00:41:53.282]  We're sitting back, reverse engineering everything they've done.
[00:41:53.682 --> 00:41:54.983]  The takeover's now public.
[00:42:00.104 --> 00:42:02.865]  And just thank God, veterans and patriots back in the 40s and 50s
[00:42:05.270 --> 00:42:13.333]  In fact, I need to look into this because I forgot to do it last night and this morning, so I'll put the alert out, kind of the bat signal to everybody.
[00:42:14.533 --> 00:42:31.359]  My dad was listening to Sergeant Sam, a retired police officer who does a popular, it's the number one morning show here locally with Mark Caesar and Ed Clements, who is just an unbelievable, I mean, Ed Clements sees me in the hallways of 590 and actually kind of bows up.
[00:42:31.419 --> 00:42:32.319]  I mean, he does not like me.
[00:42:33.467 --> 00:42:34.488]  The other two are pretty good guys.
[00:42:35.249 --> 00:42:39.914]  And Sergeant Sam, I didn't hear this, my dad heard it, was on there, and he's a smart guy, he knows about as much as I do.
[00:42:41.375 --> 00:42:41.876]  He's older.
[00:42:42.877 --> 00:42:55.951]  He goes, um, you know this Jade Helm was actually a program under State Department Memorandum 7277 for total disarmament of the American people by the United Nations.
[00:42:57.130 --> 00:43:00.836]  And I didn't have time, I forgot to Google that and search that, because I don't know if that's true.
[00:43:00.876 --> 00:43:02.018]  I'm sure it's true if he's saying it.
[00:43:02.419 --> 00:43:07.928]  He checks his facts to pretty much an erotic level, more so than I do.
[00:43:11.678 --> 00:43:14.841]  I know Memorandum 7277 is public.
[00:43:15.201 --> 00:43:16.682]  They tried to pass it as a law.
[00:43:17.343 --> 00:43:27.891]  I don't have the bill number in front of me, but it was State Department policy to federalize police under the Rand Corporation and then disarm the police and the general public and bring in federal global peacekeepers.
[00:43:28.372 --> 00:43:30.173]  That's part of the demonization of local police.
[00:43:30.394 --> 00:43:33.116]  That's why they trained them to act like crazies so they could set them up.
[00:43:36.280 --> 00:43:47.264]  So I know 7277 does that and I know they had a bill, I don't have the bill number in front of me, so what we need to search is what was the accompanying public law that they tried to pass but couldn't in 1962 under 7277?
[00:43:53.274 --> 00:43:56.715]  And it's got the manuals in the State Department packet.
[00:43:56.755 --> 00:44:00.257]  In fact, pull up 7277, Complete and Total Disarmament Document.
[00:44:00.277 --> 00:44:00.957]  Just Google that.
[00:44:01.017 --> 00:44:04.178]  We've got copies of it around the office from Congress, originals.
[00:44:04.779 --> 00:44:07.620]  But it's blue, and it shows the U.N.
[00:44:07.680 --> 00:44:11.602]  force growing in their helmets and tanks, and then the U.S.
[00:44:11.642 --> 00:44:12.322]  force shrinking.
[00:44:13.305 --> 00:44:15.306]  And then it talks about disarming the American people.
[00:44:15.527 --> 00:44:24.312]  And then Modern, July 7, 2000, UNIDIR, United Nations Committee on Small Arms Disarmament, that's the same group recommending this treaty.
[00:44:24.372 --> 00:44:27.234]  Obama says he's going to implement it outside of law, even though Congress won't ratify.
[00:44:27.254 --> 00:44:32.838]  And in that it says it will disarm the American people.
[00:44:32.858 --> 00:44:33.158]  There it is.
[00:44:33.539 --> 00:44:34.459]  Freedom from war.
[00:44:34.920 --> 00:44:35.980]  Yeah, but go to Scribbs.
[00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:37.381]  I want to show the actual document.
[00:44:37.681 --> 00:44:39.463]  Because it's got graphics of the disarmament.
[00:44:40.484 --> 00:44:44.009]  And so that's why globally you see this happening.
[00:44:44.049 --> 00:44:55.526]  But I didn't know that they listed the first exercise as Jade Helm except for an artifact remnant memory that I got chills.
[00:44:57.028 --> 00:45:24.164]  Bernadine Smith, who runs a big Second Amendment group out in California, we need to get her back on, she sent me a handmade binder about 17 years ago that had news clippings going back even to the 30s, but these were from the 60s, and I remember seeing armored vehicles and troops in a newspaper photo, like in Georgia or something, in 1962, and it said Operation Jade Helm.
[00:45:25.202 --> 00:45:26.343]  So I need to call Sergeant Sam.
[00:45:26.363 --> 00:45:27.483]  I used to have a cell phone number.
[00:45:27.503 --> 00:45:28.884]  He gave it to me and I lost it.
[00:45:29.884 --> 00:45:31.065]  Sam Cox is his name.
[00:45:31.785 --> 00:45:34.367]  But the whole point is, is that I'm pretty sure he's right.
[00:45:34.547 --> 00:45:35.747]  Because everything else he said was true.
[00:45:35.807 --> 00:45:37.148]  My dad was writing it down.
[00:45:37.168 --> 00:45:37.848]  He was talking about it.
[00:45:38.189 --> 00:45:38.829]  Driving in the car.
[00:45:38.849 --> 00:45:39.850]  I'm sure that was safe.
[00:45:39.910 --> 00:45:43.531]  But the point is, is that that's what's going on.
[00:45:44.532 --> 00:45:50.095]  And so it's just this long-standing program to do this.
[00:45:51.616 --> 00:45:55.079]  And the other host was attacking him saying he was full of prunes and all the rest of it.
[00:45:56.320 --> 00:46:02.365]  And that, you know, we hate the military and that Alex Jones hates the military and doesn't trust the military.
[00:46:02.525 --> 00:46:03.226]  They play that game.
[00:46:03.466 --> 00:46:06.128]  Oh, you think the men and women in uniform want to take over America?
[00:46:06.408 --> 00:46:07.089]  We never said that.
[00:46:07.369 --> 00:46:12.273]  We said criminals have hijacked the government and are trying to incrementally create a culture of tyranny.
[00:46:12.754 --> 00:46:14.435]  And look around you, it's here.
[00:46:15.015 --> 00:46:16.357]  And we're going to have a debate about it.
[00:46:17.037 --> 00:46:27.285]  Play in your mind games that there are no death panels in Obamacare, or there's no special deals in NAFTA, or there's no screw jobs in this bill or that bill.
[00:46:27.425 --> 00:46:31.088]  It doesn't work anymore with the thinking people.
[00:46:31.428 --> 00:46:33.650]  We know what's going on.
[00:46:33.690 --> 00:46:35.611]  We understand what's happening.
[00:46:40.475 --> 00:46:42.617]  But I read this Austin American Statesman article.
[00:46:42.757 --> 00:46:43.557]  I scanned over it.
[00:46:43.637 --> 00:46:44.658]  I spent five minutes on it.
[00:46:46.803 --> 00:46:52.287]  You know, articles on average every two days, 365 a day, you know, a thousand some days attacking you by name.
[00:46:52.647 --> 00:46:53.708]  Believe me, you can't read them all.
[00:46:53.948 --> 00:46:54.749]  But here's what's scary.
[00:46:54.969 --> 00:47:01.693]  You sample 10 or 15 of them, and they're all the exact same talking points.
[00:47:01.733 --> 00:47:06.577]  These people are taking direct conduits from the federal government.
[00:47:06.637 --> 00:47:07.898]  And this has come out, it's been admitted.
[00:47:08.318 --> 00:47:12.641]  It came out in the Sony hacks where they're being directed in TV shows and movies by the government.
[00:47:12.961 --> 00:47:15.263]  Right down to who they have and what they say and what they do.
[00:47:16.937 --> 00:47:17.638]  Super creepy.
[00:47:19.039 --> 00:47:28.267]  But that's why, out at the event in Bastrop a few days ago, we talked to a reporter from a local affiliate and we said, how many people were for Jade Helmet?
[00:47:28.287 --> 00:47:30.089]  She goes, it's 50-50.
[00:47:31.009 --> 00:47:34.112]  And there was two people out of hundreds and hundreds for it that testified.
[00:47:34.652 --> 00:47:40.758]  Just wasn't true, but they just, they know, they will ascend if they lie.
[00:47:43.080 --> 00:47:44.601]  But the truth is you don't ascend.
[00:47:45.062 --> 00:47:46.183]  Everybody already sold out.
[00:47:46.423 --> 00:47:47.063]  You get nothing.
[00:47:47.083 --> 00:47:48.084]  You lose your job.
[00:47:48.364 --> 00:47:49.205]  You lose your country.
[00:47:49.225 --> 00:47:50.266]  You lose your pension fund.
[00:47:50.486 --> 00:47:51.347]  You lose everything.
[00:47:51.387 --> 00:47:52.388]  My heavens!
[00:47:54.689 --> 00:47:59.173]  They put veterans by hundreds of thousands on no treat list when they're treatable.
[00:47:59.233 --> 00:47:59.793]  They kill them.
[00:48:00.594 --> 00:48:01.295]  They torture them.
[00:48:02.396 --> 00:48:05.098]  They don't fix broken kneecaps.
[00:48:05.398 --> 00:48:06.719]  They don't fix lung cancer.
[00:48:06.759 --> 00:48:08.661]  They don't take skin cancer off.
[00:48:09.081 --> 00:48:12.464]  They don't fix their teeth.
[00:48:14.588 --> 00:48:18.174]  It's admitted, and we don't do anything for them, because they're just like the babies and the old people.
[00:48:18.354 --> 00:48:18.855]  Write them off.
[00:48:19.015 --> 00:48:20.177]  Well, you're going to get written off.
[00:48:20.317 --> 00:48:21.840]  I'm going to get written off for that attitude.
[00:48:23.542 --> 00:48:28.350]  And the government in literally thousands of training manuals that have been made public
[00:48:28.985 --> 00:48:31.127]  Because they distribute them to every police department and vary them.
[00:48:31.447 --> 00:48:32.468]  And there's new ones every year.
[00:48:32.528 --> 00:48:32.928]  Thousands.
[00:48:33.509 --> 00:48:35.751]  Say the veteran's the enemy, we're gonna have a big war with veterans.
[00:48:35.951 --> 00:48:37.312]  Prepare for war, prepare for war.
[00:48:37.552 --> 00:48:40.495]  We go, hey look, we have big stacks of documents, videos of you singing.
[00:48:40.515 --> 00:48:41.516]  And they go, no you don't.
[00:48:42.036 --> 00:48:43.817]  I'm like, yeah, we have like 500 clips.
[00:48:43.918 --> 00:48:45.759]  And then, we've got like 20 the last week.
[00:48:45.799 --> 00:48:46.139]  No you don't.
[00:48:46.540 --> 00:48:47.441]  Well here, here are the clips.
[00:48:47.981 --> 00:48:49.102]  Uh-huh, shut up racist.
[00:48:52.024 --> 00:48:56.028]  And then they get into this thing and make fun of my body.
[00:48:58.140 --> 00:49:06.225]  And make fun of our advertisers in this article that is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 pages long.
[00:49:06.245 --> 00:49:10.587]  And they've had articles, I'm told, because I don't take the paper, every day for five or six days.
[00:49:24.246 --> 00:49:29.649]  I guess he told me three days ago he's seen it the last five days in a row, and I was told again there's new ones today, so I don't know, six, seven days.
[00:49:32.251 --> 00:49:33.092]  Why are they attacking?
[00:49:33.472 --> 00:49:35.213]  Because we stand in the way of their agenda.
[00:49:35.493 --> 00:49:35.993]  They're scared.
[00:49:36.033 --> 00:49:36.954]  We've got a governor.
[00:49:37.594 --> 00:49:38.495]  Who knows what's going on?
[00:49:38.515 --> 00:49:39.376]  We've got more governors.
[00:49:39.396 --> 00:49:41.537]  We've got state reps all over the country listening.
[00:49:41.677 --> 00:49:42.778]  We've got congressmen listening.
[00:49:43.478 --> 00:49:45.299]  What does Rachel Maddow say every week?
[00:49:45.399 --> 00:49:50.923]  Do not listen to Alex Jones, and Congress, stop bringing up legislation from stuff on his show.
[00:49:52.202 --> 00:49:53.302]  This discredits you.
[00:49:53.462 --> 00:49:54.142]  Stay away.
[00:49:54.302 --> 00:49:54.963]  Don't go there.
[00:49:55.243 --> 00:49:55.703]  Stop it.
[00:49:56.003 --> 00:49:56.223]  No.
[00:49:56.463 --> 00:49:56.963]  Don't do it.
[00:49:57.163 --> 00:49:57.763]  Don't bring it up.
[00:49:57.923 --> 00:49:58.583]  Don't talk about it.
[00:49:59.543 --> 00:50:02.704]  As if she controls reality with her confidence game.
[00:50:02.924 --> 00:50:06.145]  And it does scare off some people from the truth, but not most people anymore.
[00:50:07.725 --> 00:50:08.985]  The mind game's pretty much over.
[00:50:10.205 --> 00:50:12.206]  We're going to come back again to the economy and more.
[00:50:12.406 --> 00:50:15.486]  Ron Paul, the one and only, is coming up briefly here.
[00:50:17.107 --> 00:50:17.787]  Please support us.
[00:50:17.827 --> 00:50:18.727]  That means pray for us.

[00:50:25.745 --> 00:50:28.210]  Just please understand, I am 100% sincere.
[00:50:28.230 --> 00:50:29.673]  This is the real deal.
[00:50:30.965 --> 00:50:32.565]  And the evidence is all there.
[00:50:32.625 --> 00:50:35.346]  You can vary my interpretation, but the stuff's coming down.

[00:52:40.151 --> 00:52:43.553]  Last year, in the Nevada desert, one family took a stand for freedom.
[00:52:43.993 --> 00:52:48.276]  Numana Food Storage was the first and only company to support the rights of the Bundys.
[00:52:48.496 --> 00:52:54.399]  While others stood down, Numana took donations and provided storable foods to the men at Bunkerville.

[00:54:35.626 --> 00:54:39.287]  You know why the tyrants can't stand us?
[00:54:39.347 --> 00:54:41.988]  It's because the patriots.
[00:54:43.489 --> 00:54:46.710]  People like Governor Abbott, people like Ron Paul, people like myself.
[00:54:47.750 --> 00:54:49.511]  We just so happen to all hail from Texas.
[00:54:50.091 --> 00:54:51.411]  Ted Cruz, to a certain extent.
[00:54:52.872 --> 00:54:54.392]  I need to see more out of him, quite frankly.
[00:54:54.432 --> 00:54:55.252]  I'm not saying he's bad.
[00:54:55.393 --> 00:54:57.973]  I just don't 100% trust him yet.
[00:54:58.834 --> 00:54:59.714]  Compared to Hillary, I do.
[00:55:01.485 --> 00:55:03.327]  We value being free.
[00:55:03.387 --> 00:55:05.649]  We value private property and our families.
[00:55:05.709 --> 00:55:07.411]  We value the right to self-defense.
[00:55:07.812 --> 00:55:08.632]  It's our identity.
[00:55:09.393 --> 00:55:10.935]  We're not going to give it up.
[00:55:12.717 --> 00:55:16.000]  Not for a billion dollars, not for a trillion dollars, not for our lives.
[00:55:16.400 --> 00:55:17.061]  We're committed.
[00:55:17.321 --> 00:55:20.124]  And that's why they call us cult members in Congress.
[00:55:21.245 --> 00:55:24.529]  That's why they say I'm a cult leader at MSNBC with
[00:55:25.874 --> 00:55:26.714]  Almost no viewers.
[00:55:27.035 --> 00:55:29.476]  Their ratings yesterday, it came out, went down even more.
[00:55:29.716 --> 00:55:31.937]  Their average show in the U.S.
[00:55:32.297 --> 00:55:34.018]  has less than 100,000 viewers.
[00:55:34.538 --> 00:55:36.619]  Do you understand how joke level that is?
[00:55:36.639 --> 00:55:37.180]  But it doesn't matter.
[00:55:37.500 --> 00:55:45.204]  Their talking points from Media Matters to MSNBC get picked up by local affiliates and newspapers, and that's their real power.
[00:55:46.304 --> 00:55:49.906]  You wonder why does NBC keep them on the air for $500,000, $600,000, $700,000 a year is their budget when they lose that much.
[00:55:55.492 --> 00:56:01.054]  Because they are a talking point for a giant multi-trillion dollar global crime syndicate.
[00:56:02.415 --> 00:56:06.957]  And it's there to direct all of its other subgroups and that's where they've got power.
[00:56:08.377 --> 00:56:12.919]  Your local newscaster is reading a teleprompter written by the White House or the Pentagon.
[00:56:13.319 --> 00:56:16.661]  When I say the Pentagon, I mean the foreign powers that have taken it over.
[00:56:18.662 --> 00:56:20.362]  And does that mean Texas is perfect?
[00:56:20.442 --> 00:56:21.203]  No, but Texas
[00:56:22.156 --> 00:56:28.982]  Now is almost by itself until Saudi Arabia did this war, this energy war, producing as much as Saudi Arabia.
[00:56:30.143 --> 00:56:30.624]  The U.S.
[00:56:30.644 --> 00:56:33.967]  was producing way over Saudi Arabia, the number one producer in the world.
[00:56:34.467 --> 00:56:36.649]  This is a war to shut down independence.
[00:56:37.876 --> 00:56:44.518]  America could decide to be America again and throw off the globalist parasites, and still be a strong world leader.
[00:56:45.258 --> 00:56:47.299]  But the globalists don't want us to be a leader.
[00:56:47.539 --> 00:56:50.859]  They want to use us to build their world government, then scuttle the U.S.
[00:56:50.899 --> 00:56:59.002]  into bankruptcy, have a civil war, and come in and take us back over later, like the Boxer Rebellion, like the Opium Wars.
[00:56:59.662 --> 00:57:04.003]  If you study British intel and the Opium Wars, you understand everything.
[00:57:05.046 --> 00:57:09.491]  And that was stuff they developed in India previously with the British-Dutch-East India Company.
[00:57:10.733 --> 00:57:13.817]  And then I read books by top globalists and they talk about it.
[00:57:13.857 --> 00:57:24.470]  It's like, I've already figured it out by myself, studying history, then I read their books from their perspective and they're saying what I'm saying because it's the truth, but they're saying it from their perspective.
[00:57:28.114 --> 00:57:28.894]  Well, here's the deal.
[00:57:29.074 --> 00:57:30.514]  I'm not selling people out.
[00:57:30.735 --> 00:57:37.836]  And if we were selling out to some global corporate thing that was pro-human and wanted to empower people, I'd still be against it because it would be a sellout of free will.
[00:57:38.116 --> 00:57:46.278]  But man, this takeover is hardcore anti-human, eugenics-based, and at the end of the road is human exterminism.
[00:57:47.198 --> 00:57:49.258]  I'm going to fight to the death against this.
[00:57:49.278 --> 00:57:51.839]  I mean, there's not even a decision to make.
[00:57:53.985 --> 00:57:57.910]  You're like a flying saucer's landed and aliens got off and said we're going to kill every one of you.
[00:57:58.290 --> 00:57:59.211]  I'm going to fight to the death.
[00:57:59.251 --> 00:58:00.693]  There's no point in working with them.
[00:58:03.012 --> 00:58:04.072]  Don't you get it, folks?
[00:58:04.313 --> 00:58:05.413]  They're not gonna stop.
[00:58:05.613 --> 00:58:06.754]  They're not gonna give you a quarter.
[00:58:06.874 --> 00:58:08.034]  They're not gonna back off.
[00:58:08.234 --> 00:58:09.975]  And as soon as you get that, it's liberating.
[00:58:10.135 --> 00:58:11.796]  And then you're not gonna back off either.
[00:58:12.596 --> 00:58:17.199]  I don't care what they do to me, what they say, how they demonize, I'm not stopping.
[00:58:17.399 --> 00:58:20.680]  Because stopping is to let them completely take over.
[00:58:21.481 --> 00:58:24.242]  We're going to expose they're the ones behind all this.
[00:58:25.578 --> 00:58:28.099]  And as I said, we need your support now more than ever.
[00:58:28.139 --> 00:58:29.199]  I need to get more reporters.
[00:58:29.239 --> 00:58:34.001]  I need to get more people, not just sit here and tread water to keep this huge operation for alternative media going.
[00:58:35.321 --> 00:58:37.982]  We reach 20 million people a week globally.
[00:58:38.242 --> 00:58:38.722]  They hate it.
[00:58:39.282 --> 00:58:41.363]  I want to go to 40, 50, 100 million.
[00:58:42.003 --> 00:58:44.304]  I want to expose their propaganda blow by blow.
[00:58:45.024 --> 00:58:45.804]  I want to go in.

[01:00:03.036 --> 01:00:05.652]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:16.550 --> 01:00:20.712]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:21.392 --> 01:00:22.192]  You want answers?
[01:00:22.973 --> 01:00:23.853]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:24.513 --> 01:00:28.135]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:28.715 --> 01:00:32.817]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:34.158 --> 01:00:38.239]  Former Congressman Ron Paul is scheduled to be joining us coming up in the next segment.
[01:00:38.279 --> 01:00:39.560]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[01:00:42.498 --> 01:01:00.389]  There has been just an absolute conniption fit by the establishment testing a PSYOP on the American people through the pliant lapdog globalist media working with the Pentagon to convert our country into a type of soft martial law police state playground.
[01:01:02.410 --> 01:01:09.455]  Our listeners and other patriots have forced a global debate about militarization of police, federalization,
[01:01:10.856 --> 01:01:16.998]  Military drills, military training to confiscate guns, all the videos, all the training manuals, and then one of the biggest drills ever comes up.
[01:01:17.018 --> 01:01:20.599]  We find out it has all the hallmarks of other gun confiscation roundup drills.
[01:01:20.880 --> 01:01:27.202]  They now admit, basically, that's part of it, but then lie to national news and say it's for foreign operations.
[01:01:28.102 --> 01:01:30.203]  Which, of course, some of it undoubtedly will have dual purposes.
[01:01:31.836 --> 01:01:33.618]  There are 365 articles currently.
[01:01:33.658 --> 01:01:35.859]  I don't just say 365 because it's a total number.
[01:01:36.159 --> 01:01:42.925]  That's the number Google says the last 24 hours, with my name in it, saying that basically I'm saying martial law is imminent.
[01:01:42.985 --> 01:01:43.285]  No, no.
[01:01:43.585 --> 01:01:44.185]  It's not imminent.
[01:01:44.246 --> 01:01:44.826]  It's already here.
[01:01:45.867 --> 01:01:48.088]  We're not going to be putting a boiling pot of water.
[01:01:48.128 --> 01:01:50.110]  We're in a pot, and it's starting to get hot.
[01:01:53.572 --> 01:02:00.818]  And now they want to demonize a true enemy of the Obama administration, somebody who more than the entire Republican Congress, when he was Attorney General,
[01:02:04.571 --> 01:02:16.259]  Governor Abbott of Texas has come out and said, listen, I'm concerned about our civil liberties and our freedoms and sovereignty because he understands we're being federally taken over.
[01:02:17.760 --> 01:02:21.643]  So he says he's going to have the state guard monitor it.
[01:02:22.063 --> 01:02:23.745]  And so they lie about what he said.
[01:02:25.045 --> 01:02:26.006]  The Americans are coming.
[01:02:26.026 --> 01:02:26.907]  The Americans are coming.
[01:02:28.083 --> 01:02:29.923]  Making fun of Paul Revere.
[01:02:29.963 --> 01:02:31.504]  Back then, the Redcoats were British.
[01:02:31.624 --> 01:02:32.184]  They were British.
[01:02:32.944 --> 01:02:34.324]  And they had become the enemy, the oppressors.
[01:02:34.344 --> 01:02:35.965]  So they were saying, the Redcoats, the military.
[01:02:36.305 --> 01:02:38.445]  They were saying, the British are coming, the British are coming.
[01:02:38.685 --> 01:02:39.445]  Our people are coming.
[01:02:40.105 --> 01:02:41.046]  We're now breaking with them.
[01:02:41.566 --> 01:02:45.707]  But this is the Americans, this is the globalist sympathizers that run our military.
[01:02:46.287 --> 01:02:47.807]  Our military doesn't want to carry out this mission.
[01:02:47.827 --> 01:02:48.987]  Our military knows what's going on.
[01:02:49.427 --> 01:02:51.988]  They want to run these drills also to find out who in the military
[01:02:52.848 --> 01:02:55.870]  Like Katrina was a test, we'll go along with gun confiscation.
[01:02:56.270 --> 01:03:03.793]  And you know a lot of the leaders of Jade Helm are people that took part, we're looking into this right now, we have some intel on it, in gun confiscation in Katrina.
[01:03:04.494 --> 01:03:06.635]  And see, they're just corporate climbers.
[01:03:06.975 --> 01:03:11.157]  They don't want to be in the military to protect the Republic, to protect our liberties, or that oath they swore to.
[01:03:11.597 --> 01:03:19.181]  They're there to oppress and dominate and go to high and dry houses during an emergency and take guns out of safes and give them to the FBI.
[01:03:22.887 --> 01:03:29.872]  And the military is begging the public to say no to this and stop this, and it was mainly veterans out there in Bastrop by the hundreds saying no to it.
[01:03:30.152 --> 01:03:32.754]  They see through the PSYOP, and that's why they're listed as the enemy.
[01:03:35.296 --> 01:03:40.200]  And they'll have mayor's order stand-downs, caught red-handed in Baltimore to get riots going.
[01:03:40.280 --> 01:03:42.001]  This is their plan to destabilize the country.
[01:03:42.021 --> 01:03:48.506]  I don't know if it's going to be race riots, economic collapse, a major war, or a combination of all of those, or part of those, but
[01:03:50.609 --> 01:03:54.432]  Preparation under Clinton for martial law was about a two or three, but it was still shocking.
[01:03:55.312 --> 01:04:00.716]  Under Bush, it was a different type of martial law, just taking over the system, but not a preparation to take on the Patriots so much.
[01:04:01.436 --> 01:04:12.764]  Under Obama, it's just, the preparation is, without exaggerating, a hundred times what it was under Clinton.
[01:04:12.924 --> 01:04:17.968]  I mean, it's a full-on attempted takeover.
[01:04:20.154 --> 01:04:22.995]  Not even executive orders to just power grab.
[01:04:23.676 --> 01:04:24.476]  It's already happened.
[01:04:24.516 --> 01:04:42.123]  When the president's ruling by executive fiat, and the borders are wide open, and he's funding ISIS and claiming he's fighting ISIS, and they're just doing whatever they want, and there's huge military drills everywhere, and TSA on the streets, and NSA spying on you without warrants, you're living in a bonafide tyranny.
[01:04:46.334 --> 01:04:52.517]  And I know you as an audience know that from your own research, but we've got to reach out to the public and show them the scam.
[01:04:53.677 --> 01:04:56.079]  And go, hey, did you know Enron came up with the carbon tax?
[01:04:57.519 --> 01:04:59.400]  Hey, did you know General Electric's exempt from that?
[01:05:00.661 --> 01:05:07.684]  Hey, did you know that Alex didn't say martial law was coming this summer, but this was just more conditioning towards ultimate tyranny down the road?
[01:05:10.683 --> 01:05:14.125]  I'm not concerned with your liking or disliking me.
[01:05:14.765 --> 01:05:19.108]  All I ask is that you treat me as a human being, Jackie Robinson.
[01:05:19.728 --> 01:05:24.471]  When people don't like what you represent, they'll oftentimes attack you personally.
[01:05:25.292 --> 01:05:29.054]  But if you can't endure, you may just pave the way for those who follow you.
[01:05:30.314 --> 01:05:42.942]  Jesus said, I say to you, love your enemies, bless those who curse you, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who spitefully use you and persecute you.
[01:05:43.743 --> 01:05:48.946]  Had Christ submitted to the authorities of the time, he never would have preached the gospel.
[01:05:49.507 --> 01:05:56.792]  And though he was very vocal in his opposition, he never forgot that he was there to save the same people he often had to rebuke.

[01:07:16.239 --> 01:07:16.299]  Why?
[01:07:32.073 --> 01:07:35.215]  And are being hammered daily by globalist concoctions.
[01:07:35.515 --> 01:07:40.378]  It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down and then are put on dangerous psychotropic drugs.

[01:08:13.353 --> 01:08:19.375]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:08:19.995 --> 01:08:22.956]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:34.474 --> 01:08:47.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're joined by former congressman, medical doctor, Dr. Ron Paul, and I've got a ton of questions for him as we kick off the second hour here with the Alex Jones Show, hosted by yours truly.
[01:08:47.340 --> 01:09:03.548]  Our news websites are InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, and we'll of course give you Ron Paul's channel, Facebook.com forward slash Ron Paul, RonPaulChannel.com, and of course the Ron Paul Institute, doing so much amazing work with the young people
[01:09:04.049 --> 01:09:06.557]  and others out there across the country.
[01:09:07.901 --> 01:09:09.747]  First off, it's great to have you back, Dr. Paul.
[01:09:10.407 --> 01:09:10.867]  Thank you.
[01:09:11.288 --> 01:09:12.028]  Good to be with you.
[01:09:12.248 --> 01:09:12.509]  Wow.
[01:09:12.889 --> 01:09:20.955]  First thing I want to get into, you've been talking about a big monetary event coming, the global devaluation of currencies, the QE unlimited.
[01:09:20.975 --> 01:09:26.920]  Now we hear that really the growth, despite all the money printing, was 0.2 percent.
[01:09:26.960 --> 01:09:30.462]  That's with Cook numbers showing it's probably even 2 or 3 percent negative.
[01:09:31.303 --> 01:09:32.984]  We have the headlines, U.S.
[01:09:33.024 --> 01:09:35.706]  stocks drop as GDP comes in weak.
[01:09:36.527 --> 01:09:38.669]  On top of that, what does this signify?
[01:09:39.469 --> 01:09:40.850]  How close are we to the big event?
[01:09:41.411 --> 01:09:46.614]  Well, you know, they give us the numbers, they fudge them, but the Wall Streeters still believe it.
[01:09:46.694 --> 01:09:48.356]  But I think they're getting more reluctant.
[01:09:48.396 --> 01:09:49.817]  That market is pretty shaky.
[01:09:50.317 --> 01:09:55.040]  But the other day when they gave us the GDP number, they said it was, what, 0.2% increase.
[01:09:55.401 --> 01:09:58.503]  But if you looked at the inventory increase,
[01:09:58.903 --> 01:10:00.303]  They use that as a positive.
[01:10:00.403 --> 01:10:01.144]  Oh, they're building up.
[01:10:01.204 --> 01:10:02.064]  People are going to buy.
[01:10:02.304 --> 01:10:05.485]  But sometimes the inventory builds up because nobody's buying.
[01:10:05.905 --> 01:10:10.746]  And if you remove that, which I think is artificial, you have, and I think you mentioned, a negative growth.
[01:10:10.827 --> 01:10:12.407]  It was probably down a couple percent.
[01:10:12.867 --> 01:10:16.988]  And there's a limit to how much bad news can be twisted into being good news.
[01:10:17.048 --> 01:10:18.489]  And I think they're running out of steam.
[01:10:19.489 --> 01:10:22.331]  The Fed has printed so much for so long.
[01:10:22.691 --> 01:10:28.214]  This is why I'm predicting that the, and you've heard me talk about it for years, the vulnerability of the dollar.
[01:10:28.455 --> 01:10:30.536]  And we've had a free ride for a long time.
[01:10:30.576 --> 01:10:35.039]  We have the reserve currency of the world, and people have been more or less forced to it.
[01:10:35.079 --> 01:10:40.682]  But there are countries now thinking about alternatives, and there's other countries that are buying the gold.
[01:10:41.442 --> 01:10:46.786]  So I think even technically speaking right now, the dollar is looking
[01:10:47.786 --> 01:10:49.728]  It may have already started down.
[01:10:49.788 --> 01:10:56.255]  You know, it was up like 35% in the last year or two, and now it's turning around and starting down.
[01:10:56.295 --> 01:10:59.878]  I think we're still seeing the beginning of a falling dollar.
[01:11:00.079 --> 01:11:04.623]  The big question is, is people only look at the other currencies and say, oh, the dollar's falling.
[01:11:04.643 --> 01:11:07.306]  Does that mean we have to buy euros or something else?
[01:11:07.726 --> 01:11:11.350]  No, it's all a mess, and when the dollar crash comes,
[01:11:11.810 --> 01:11:13.613]  People won't trust any of the currencies.
[01:11:13.653 --> 01:11:14.935]  They'll go to real money.
[01:11:15.035 --> 01:11:16.697]  They will buy gold and silver.
[01:11:16.757 --> 01:11:18.700]  They're going to latch on to anything that's real.
[01:11:19.341 --> 01:11:27.152]  And even real estate and other things like this will serve as a preservation of wealth, and it won't be in holding dollars.
[01:11:28.777 --> 01:11:36.622]  Unfortunately, I don't see how you could economically be incorrect about what you're saying, and even mainline analysts admit that no bubble's ever gone this far.
[01:11:37.263 --> 01:11:41.406]  My concern is, historically, now you've studied Austrian economics and history, Dr. Paul.
[01:11:42.628 --> 01:11:56.171]  The bigger the bubble, the worse the calamity, and then you add the record dependency of 100 million Americans on some form of assistance, and you add to that the rapacious paramilitary nature of Western governments.
[01:11:56.191 --> 01:12:04.133]  That sounds like a recipe for a perfect storm of really hellish repercussions when the bubble pops.
[01:12:04.893 --> 01:12:10.775]  Yeah, and this is why I assume, and I'm sure you agree, that it's going to be even worse than 2008 and 2009.
[01:12:10.835 --> 01:12:11.675]  You know, the crisis hit.
[01:12:13.668 --> 01:12:15.169]  The debt was the problem.
[01:12:15.349 --> 01:12:20.551]  The debt was bought by the taxpayer, and it was all transferred to the taxpayer through the Fed.
[01:12:20.991 --> 01:12:22.592]  The big guys rebelled out.
[01:12:23.072 --> 01:12:33.416]  And the amount of debt worldwide that has increased since the crisis of 2009 is $35 trillion of more debt.
[01:12:33.716 --> 01:12:36.757]  So there was no correction whatsoever, and no growth.
[01:12:37.097 --> 01:12:38.958]  No, the Keynesians are real pleased.
[01:12:38.998 --> 01:12:40.379]  Well, we saved your life.
[01:12:40.739 --> 01:12:41.940]  We saved Wall Street.
[01:12:42.060 --> 01:12:44.322]  Otherwise, the whole thing would have come down on us.
[01:12:44.822 --> 01:12:50.245]  But it comes down maybe a little slower and a little differently by propping it up with an illusion.
[01:12:50.345 --> 01:12:54.008]  So the system has been propped up, but it's all a fallacy.
[01:12:54.048 --> 01:12:57.230]  It's all a myth that there's wealth growth out there.
[01:12:58.410 --> 01:13:01.011]  More people dependent on government.
[01:13:01.291 --> 01:13:02.671]  Half the people don't work.
[01:13:02.792 --> 01:13:04.472]  More people on food stamps.
[01:13:04.912 --> 01:13:11.834]  Real labor values have not gone up since the Bretton Woods broke down in the 70s.
[01:13:12.194 --> 01:13:16.796]  So that's why there's this fight going on between the rich and the poor.
[01:13:17.747 --> 01:13:34.328]  And unfortunately, the people that we might even agree with when they make these statements are using it as a tool to bash freedom and free markets and say, well, the rich are getting rich and they're gouging everybody else, but they're getting rich because they're part of the government.
[01:13:34.768 --> 01:13:40.935]  But they'd like to end this whole idea that the solution isn't well.
[01:13:40.975 --> 01:13:45.941]  What we need to do is tax the productive people so that we can take care of more.
[01:13:45.961 --> 01:13:51.247]  But they've been doing it and we're in a mess and I think, like you said, the crisis is worse now than ever before.
[01:13:51.943 --> 01:13:53.504]  Well, I mean, look at the usual suspects.
[01:13:53.544 --> 01:13:58.166]  Warren Buffett was the biggest promoter and lobbyer for the bailout, and he was the biggest recipient.
[01:13:58.527 --> 01:14:01.608]  McClatchy reported $400-something billion to his company.
[01:14:01.948 --> 01:14:04.710]  He himself got like $2 billion of taxpayer money.
[01:14:05.330 --> 01:14:06.551]  It's just incredible.
[01:14:06.611 --> 01:14:09.573]  And then he gets up there and calls for taxing the rich.
[01:14:09.973 --> 01:14:12.434]  He means people making $125,000 a year.
[01:14:12.454 --> 01:14:13.755]  That's not rich.
[01:14:13.855 --> 01:14:14.935]  That's who produces.
[01:14:15.216 --> 01:14:16.436]  That's who hires people.
[01:14:16.476 --> 01:14:17.577]  That's who buys things.
[01:14:18.177 --> 01:14:19.218]  So it's the ultra-rich
[01:14:20.098 --> 01:14:29.501]  Trying to create a giant dependent class, that's always been their plan, and now they're scapegoating capitalism for what they've created.
[01:14:29.721 --> 01:14:36.183]  What would you call this corporatist, fascist, crony, would you call it crony capitalism?
[01:14:36.363 --> 01:14:38.984]  What's the best name for it, Dr. Paul, the current system?
[01:14:39.464 --> 01:14:54.215]  Well, crony capitalism is pretty good, but if you want to get closer to what is coming, and we might have a bit of it now, is pure fascism, where it's a combination of a partnership between big business and big banking and government.
[01:14:54.575 --> 01:14:56.176]  And it's not a partisan thing.
[01:14:56.216 --> 01:15:01.139]  Most people get to think, oh yeah, all we need is Hillary and the Democrats and they'll straighten this mess out.
[01:15:01.820 --> 01:15:06.023]  But one thing that's neat about what we're reading and hearing about Hillary is it's
[01:15:06.443 --> 01:15:16.229]  So disproving, but I just can't imagine people still believing that the Democrats are less likely to be involved in this scam than the Republicans.
[01:15:16.909 --> 01:15:23.193]  But they're both trained by the same economists, they're all Keynesians, they're all interventionists, they're all authoritarians.
[01:15:23.793 --> 01:15:28.357]  And the principle of liberty doesn't even cross their mind, they don't have the vaguest notion about it.
[01:15:28.717 --> 01:15:37.825]  They believe that you have to have the elite, who are the authoritarians, and they'll pretend they're going to take care of people at the same time, all they do is build up their power.
[01:15:38.145 --> 01:15:43.749]  Eventually it ends, because the currency will end, and that's what we're starting to see happening right now.
[01:15:46.633 --> 01:15:50.714]  The Ron Paul Institute's fighting it with incredible intellectual research and documentation.
[01:15:51.114 --> 01:15:52.114]  Your son's fighting it.
[01:15:52.775 --> 01:15:56.476]  The leader of the presidential pack right now for Republican candidates.
[01:15:58.416 --> 01:16:01.497]  Governor Abbott is suing the federal government over its tyranny.
[01:16:02.077 --> 01:16:03.997]  There's a lot of good news coming out.
[01:16:04.017 --> 01:16:05.158]  I want to talk to you about that.
[01:16:06.638 --> 01:16:16.340]  The power structure and all these manuals and documents, I'm going to play a clip of this in a moment, of police being asked in Indiana and in Washington, you know, why are you getting MRAPs?
[01:16:16.380 --> 01:16:19.701]  And they say it's for the patriots, it's for the veterans, it's for the gun owners.
[01:16:20.101 --> 01:16:26.542]  You remember that first MIAC report we got six years ago that listed you, and at first your office was calling me going, Alex, is this really real?
[01:16:26.882 --> 01:16:29.723]  I'm like, no, we got it, we got it from the state police, it's real.
[01:16:30.023 --> 01:16:30.803]  Later they admitted it.
[01:16:31.863 --> 01:16:44.629]  What are the totalitarians, the fascists, going to do with the tens of millions of Americans of every race, color, and creed and a large portion of college students and others that understand what's happening and aren't going to go along?
[01:16:45.836 --> 01:16:50.699]  Well, they're going to continue with the corruption and expand the corruption in the judicial system.
[01:16:50.959 --> 01:16:58.044]  And this is what really is a problem, because you have a lot of people breaking the law.
[01:16:58.084 --> 01:17:01.266]  You have a petraeus that breaks the law, and he gets his hand slapped.
[01:17:01.547 --> 01:17:03.668]  Then you read about the Clintons, and they don't get anything.
[01:17:03.708 --> 01:17:10.933]  You read about Edward Snowden, who is a patriotic hero, and he's a man without a country.
[01:17:11.273 --> 01:17:15.576]  So it's turned on its head, but what really is something that we ought to
[01:17:16.156 --> 01:17:16.396]  I think?
[01:17:33.366 --> 01:17:36.229]  And we have had this federal takeover already.
[01:17:36.269 --> 01:17:40.052]  You know, 100,000 federal bureaucrats who carry guns.
[01:17:40.513 --> 01:17:43.856]  You know, we worry about the future, but I'm worried about the present.
[01:17:44.276 --> 01:17:48.200]  You know, but where I'm encouraged, and I know you get some encouragement too,
[01:17:49.040 --> 01:17:51.022]  Is that people are waking up.
[01:17:51.403 --> 01:17:53.825]  I think nullification is here to stay with us.
[01:17:54.245 --> 01:17:57.768]  States will eventually say, look, you've overstepped your bounds.
[01:17:58.409 --> 01:18:00.211]  And especially when the dollar won't work.
[01:18:00.451 --> 01:18:06.917]  That's when you're going to see this, the individual states, individuals, staying upon themselves to protect themselves.
[01:18:07.277 --> 01:18:08.979]  And that is what I think is coming.
[01:18:09.039 --> 01:18:12.402]  It's a maniac war on drugs.
[01:18:12.702 --> 01:18:13.402]  We're good to go.
[01:18:31.588 --> 01:18:40.695]  So we have a mess there, but it's the judicial system, and I think the drug laws have been unfairly enforced, and all kinds of reasons for that.
[01:18:41.336 --> 01:18:50.343]  And as many of us worry about, I mean, we see our city starting to explode, and let's hope it can be settled down so we can have a little bit of improvement.
[01:18:50.363 --> 01:18:53.785]  But right now, it looks like it could expand.
[01:18:54.046 --> 01:18:55.987]  Well, that brings me to my next question.
[01:18:57.248 --> 01:18:59.229]  Obviously, the Feds have militarized the police.
[01:18:59.249 --> 01:19:03.252]  Hillary comes out and says, you know, we have to have police accountable.
[01:19:04.312 --> 01:19:11.036]  We can't have militarization when under Clinton, the war on drugs exploded, the militarization, that's when it really expanded.
[01:19:11.717 --> 01:19:14.479]  It's accelerated now under Obama, also under Bush.
[01:19:15.319 --> 01:19:30.117]  But it's the war on drugs that militarized police, but then separately you have George Soros and the left and Obama and Biden going out and saying the Republicans want to put your chains back on, the cops want to kill you, because they can't give them jobs.
[01:19:30.157 --> 01:19:34.962]  Black unemployment's doubled under Obama, so they're going to give them, I guess, racial identity and infighting.
[01:19:35.643 --> 01:19:40.286]  And then the mayor orders a stand down so they can get things going.
[01:19:40.406 --> 01:19:50.111]  I'm really concerned this could be a false flag coming up this summer as the media hypes these tragic deaths to try to get something like the 60s going again.
[01:19:50.351 --> 01:19:51.412]  Can you speak to that, sir?
[01:19:52.492 --> 01:20:01.479]  Well, that's always possible, but we had a very bad example of the authoritarians taking over after the bombing in Boston.
[01:20:01.519 --> 01:20:05.923]  That was a good practice session, so I think they're going to continue to do that.
[01:20:06.283 --> 01:20:15.251]  It's not like the principles and the power behind FEMA, that's not brand new, but I think so much of that has already occurred.
[01:20:15.291 --> 01:20:18.873]  I think some of the activity that goes on is sort of conditioning the people to say,
[01:20:19.734 --> 01:20:27.140]  You know, we'll have this, and we'll have some training here, and the people sort of say, well, you know, they didn't take over the whole country.
[01:20:28.902 --> 01:20:31.824]  So they try to talk themselves out of it.
[01:20:31.844 --> 01:20:39.791]  The thing that bugs me the most that has come up since 9-11 is that too many people are complacent and actually encourage it.
[01:20:40.051 --> 01:20:45.896]  The media is horrible, the politicians are horrible, but too many individuals say, Ron,
[01:20:47.057 --> 01:20:50.899]  You've got to realize, you've got to give up some of your freedoms to be safe.
[01:20:51.259 --> 01:20:53.720]  And that's why you should have voted for the Patriot Act.
[01:20:54.160 --> 01:20:56.261]  You know, that stuff still is around.
[01:20:56.521 --> 01:20:58.062]  You know, they're still talking that way.
[01:20:58.422 --> 01:21:07.246]  But people, safety and security is valued more than their liberty, and of course you know what that ends up with.
[01:21:07.266 --> 01:21:10.888]  Well, we know that when you give up liberty, you get ultimate insecurity.
[01:21:10.948 --> 01:21:12.089]  You get enslavement.
[01:21:13.189 --> 01:21:14.190]  Ron Paul is our guest.
[01:21:14.210 --> 01:21:15.270]  We've got a few minutes left with him.
[01:21:15.630 --> 01:21:23.034]  Doctor, I want to get into something you talked a lot about in the last 30 years of your public life, and that was the slow militarization of police.
[01:21:23.554 --> 01:21:25.495]  Now it's become a big national issue.
[01:21:25.515 --> 01:21:27.016]  Even the New York Times says it's a problem.
[01:21:27.336 --> 01:21:31.378]  They admit that the IRS is taking people's bank accounts for no reason.
[01:21:31.718 --> 01:21:35.460]  I mean, the IRS is persecuting the Tea Party and groups.
[01:21:35.480 --> 01:21:36.961]  I mean, we're really already living
[01:21:37.461 --> 01:21:44.065]  I think under a form of martial law, as you said, we're being phased into total fascism or complete fascism.
[01:21:45.266 --> 01:21:52.690]  The Governor Abbott came out and put a tweet out two days ago saying, I want to make sure our liberties are watched and that Texas sovereignty is watched.
[01:21:52.750 --> 01:21:55.031]  I'm going to dispatch the Texas Guard to watch Jade Helm.
[01:21:55.551 --> 01:21:58.613]  I never said when we broke Jade Helm a month ago that it would be martial law.
[01:21:59.053 --> 01:22:02.155]  I never said that Obama was coming to take the state.
[01:22:02.255 --> 01:22:03.596]  I said it was more conditioning.
[01:22:04.056 --> 01:22:20.241]  But they have had literally thousands of articles the last month, 300 plus yesterday, every channel in Austin, national news, every channel, saying, I'm saying there's going to be martial law, the governor is, and that we're all kooks, they're attacking, Rand's been sucked into it.
[01:22:20.821 --> 01:22:25.623]  What do you do about these straw men where they go, oh, there is no NSA, and there is, or, oh,
[01:22:27.383 --> 01:22:37.128]  Alex says there's going to be martial law when all we're saying is there's this continued march and they admit in Forbes that the Army is trying to take on the Tea Party.
[01:22:37.148 --> 01:22:40.390]  I mean we have clips of them saying the MRAPs are for the veterans.
[01:22:41.051 --> 01:22:46.413]  So basically your take on this incremental boiling frog and then these
[01:22:47.921 --> 01:22:57.124]  I guess you call them straw men, where they claim we said something that we didn't really say, and then when total martial law doesn't come, they say we're discredited.
[01:22:57.764 --> 01:22:58.624]  Yeah.
[01:22:58.704 --> 01:22:59.684]  That's the way they work.
[01:22:59.804 --> 01:23:08.427]  I guess we do our best to just get the truth out there, and I think more people are looking for the truth and are skeptical of all the propaganda.
[01:23:09.887 --> 01:23:12.408]  But I was sort of... I thought that...
[01:23:13.556 --> 01:23:22.399]  This Abbott ruling or sending the National Guard there was a reflection that there is a sentiment with enough people that he is responding.
[01:23:23.019 --> 01:23:29.742]  I don't know the governor and I don't know personally where his views are, but I think he senses
[01:23:30.442 --> 01:23:34.665]  That he has to respond to this because there's enough people who are worried about it.
[01:23:35.025 --> 01:23:42.189]  But both sides might be doing some of the grandstanding, you know, and so often, though, that can get out of hand.
[01:23:42.549 --> 01:23:51.335]  I think what is happening now is that we know about the militarization of the police and the overreaction and the difficulty with the drug war.
[01:23:51.895 --> 01:24:07.746]  But we also noticed that there are some people that are on the receiving end of excessive police force are overreacting too and they become very, very violent and people can get pretty nervous about that as well.
[01:24:08.767 --> 01:24:16.551]  But the big overwhelming thing that drives the problem in the inner city is back to economics.
[01:24:16.671 --> 01:24:23.794]  If we had a thriving economy, the problems in the inner city wouldn't be there.
[01:24:24.095 --> 01:24:33.019]  But if you have an entitlement system, and if you have Keynesian economics, if you have a Federal Reserve fixing it up for the rich, then the rich getting richer,
[01:24:33.519 --> 01:24:33.860]  I think so.
[01:24:52.903 --> 01:24:56.585]  Uh, you know, it lasts for, you know, an indefinite period of time.
[01:24:56.605 --> 01:25:01.288]  They always end, and this one has gone on for way too long, and it's bigger than ever.
[01:25:01.308 --> 01:25:06.591]  There's never been a fiat currency like the dollar engulfing the entire world like it is today.
[01:25:06.631 --> 01:25:12.254]  And they're clearly, in closing, gearing up during a collapse to try to accelerate into tyranny.
[01:25:12.274 --> 01:25:21.259]  I want to play a 10-second clip for you to see if you've heard it from Morgan County, Indiana, one of dozens we have, with them saying the MRAP tanks are for the veterans.
[01:25:21.299 --> 01:25:21.799]  Here's the clip.
[01:25:22.455 --> 01:25:26.019]  We really didn't have the violence that we see today.
[01:25:26.820 --> 01:25:31.686]  The weaponry is totally different now than it was in the beginning of my career.
[01:25:32.466 --> 01:25:40.616]  Plus, you have a lot of people that are coming out of the military that have the ability and the knowledge to build IEDs and to defeat law enforcement techniques.
[01:25:40.976 --> 01:25:47.004]  So there they are, Congressman, and we have clips during pre-Jade Helms training where they're trying to take on the Tea Party.
[01:25:47.304 --> 01:25:48.426]  I'll play that after you leave.
[01:25:48.466 --> 01:25:49.747]  I'm just documenting this here.
[01:25:50.188 --> 01:25:57.177]  How can they say Jade Helms for overseas when they admit that it's also for domestic snatch and grab operations?
[01:25:58.549 --> 01:26:01.031]  I don't have a complete understanding of that.
[01:26:01.071 --> 01:26:03.112]  I don't have a precise answer for that.
[01:26:03.132 --> 01:26:09.256]  All I know is it's very difficult to sort out exactly what they're up to and what they're doing.
[01:26:09.276 --> 01:26:19.902]  I do know that they're not worried about our liberty, and I do know that they take care of the very wealthy special interest, which is a system that we have that takes care of quite well.
[01:26:20.002 --> 01:26:22.083]  What do you think, in closing, of Governor Abbott?
[01:26:22.123 --> 01:26:24.885]  I think he's been actually doing a pretty good job since he got in here in Texas.
[01:26:26.005 --> 01:26:34.367]  I think so, and I didn't do anything special to help him, but I'll tell you what, we could have a lot worse.
[01:26:36.048 --> 01:26:39.348]  Nothing has struck me that makes me displeased.
[01:26:39.688 --> 01:26:42.829]  I don't happen to watch state issues very closely.
[01:26:43.209 --> 01:26:53.692]  I guess his recent announcement here today about Jade Helm got my attention more than anything else, but I would say that he's doing a decent job.
[01:26:54.332 --> 01:26:57.914]  It's very refreshing to just see somebody do their job like you did in Congress.
[01:26:58.335 --> 01:26:59.495]  God bless you, Dr. No.
[01:26:59.515 --> 01:27:00.416]  We really appreciate you.
[01:27:00.936 --> 01:27:01.417]  Good, Alex.
[01:27:01.497 --> 01:27:02.037]  Talk to you soon.
[01:27:02.277 --> 01:27:03.038]  Thank you so much.
[01:27:03.398 --> 01:27:05.739]  Another powerful interview with former Congressman Ron Paul.
[01:27:06.640 --> 01:27:16.666]  I tell you, I don't get excited when I've gotten a chance to meet some of the most famous rock stars and movie stars, unless I'm fans of what they do, and then it's exciting just because I like their art.
[01:27:17.347 --> 01:27:20.469]  But it's just nothing compared to someone like Ron Paul.
[01:27:21.589 --> 01:27:22.029]  and others.
[01:27:22.810 --> 01:27:31.194]  Now at the same time I know some celebrities like Dave Mustaine and Billy Corrigan who get attacked when they come on viciously and still come on and still have courage.
[01:27:31.534 --> 01:27:33.955]  That I admire and I get butterflies over.
[01:27:34.516 --> 01:27:49.763]  But I can get around you know a firefighter that goes in a burning house and you know to save a child and gets burned and I just get tears in my eyes thinking about what a good man that is or a good woman because we're supposed to admire people that stand up for liberty.
[01:27:51.030 --> 01:27:57.595]  Not a basketball player, not a football player, not some drugged out rock star, just because they got 20 women.
[01:27:59.976 --> 01:28:02.138]  And I'm not on some moral high horse when I say that.
[01:28:02.158 --> 01:28:03.879]  I'm just saying that's not my God.
[01:28:05.700 --> 01:28:08.342]  I will not sell out the unborn.
[01:28:08.502 --> 01:28:10.303]  I will not sell out the Second Amendment.
[01:28:10.604 --> 01:28:12.145]  I will not sell out the family.
[01:28:12.465 --> 01:28:16.688]  I will not compromise on not being hit with soft kill weapons to make us weak and stupid.
[01:28:18.271 --> 01:28:19.431]  The fluoride and the rest of it.
[01:28:20.111 --> 01:28:40.937]  And it means nothing under their fake peer pressure paradigm to be lectured and attacked by a bunch of nobodies like Rachel Maddow and CBS News and Anderson Cooper of the CIA at CNN.
[01:28:43.390 --> 01:28:46.311]  But they, they live in a world of caring what everybody says about them.
[01:28:46.351 --> 01:28:47.931]  They live in a world of being empty.
[01:28:48.051 --> 01:29:08.176]  And you know, as Jakari Jackson said in an earlier little vignette information bulletins that we now have during the advertisements, Christ, even when he was rebuking people and not following their orders unto death, he didn't hate them because he realized these are the people he was there to save.
[01:29:12.014 --> 01:29:25.263]  And we have to understand that I don't even hate a Rachel Maddow or people like that anymore because I realize how pathetic they are and where they've put themselves in this universe.
[01:29:25.724 --> 01:29:27.185]  I want to say great job to the crew.
[01:29:27.765 --> 01:29:30.387]  They were scrambling while I was trying to get them to get clips on the fly.
[01:29:30.447 --> 01:29:37.032]  I should come in earlier and actually line up all the clips I want to play, but we're going to play some of those clips when we come back because
[01:29:37.532 --> 01:29:41.233]  I mean, there's just so many of them, with the military in every drill that we get on tape.
[01:29:41.293 --> 01:29:48.095]  I mean, we just go to an event, or our reporters do, or our listeners do, and just every time, the military's trying to take on patriots.
[01:29:48.995 --> 01:29:57.878]  And then they just want to make this preparation, condition the military it's okay, have the civil war with us as if we were just going to wait here on our butts.
[01:29:58.238 --> 01:29:58.878]  We're getting ready.
[01:29:59.878 --> 01:30:00.778]  We're on the march.
[01:30:01.278 --> 01:30:02.879]  The empire's on the run.
[01:30:03.819 --> 01:30:06.500]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:10.632 --> 01:30:16.373]  Presidential wannabe Hillary Clinton blamed the Baltimore riots on income inequality and race.
[01:30:16.653 --> 01:30:24.775]  But what's really to blame in Baltimore, and what Clinton failed to address, are the Democratic policies that have plagued the city for half a century.
[01:30:24.995 --> 01:30:27.095]  Democrats run the city of Baltimore.
[01:30:27.275 --> 01:30:30.436]  The unions, the schools, and yes, the police force.
[01:30:30.796 --> 01:30:34.897]  The city has been effectively a single party political monopoly for decades.
[01:30:35.117 --> 01:30:44.521]  That's years of bad government policies that have been particularly destructive to any opportunity for employment and stability that are key to lifting its citizens out of poverty.
[01:30:44.781 --> 01:30:51.464]  And while lucrative for the ruling party's cronies, cradle-to-grave welfare is crippling to the people it alleges to help.
[01:30:51.824 --> 01:30:57.746]  Cities ruled by Democrats have become the hardest places in America to launch a business or hire someone.
[01:30:57.986 --> 01:31:03.348]  It's the liberal policies that have turned another once great American city into a war zone.

[01:31:10.694 --> 01:31:11.635]  Hi, I'm Alex Jones.
[01:31:11.795 --> 01:31:19.463]  When I got on air 20 years ago, I weighed 180 pounds, I lifted weights 5 days a week, I could swim 2-3 miles.
[01:31:19.824 --> 01:31:22.727]  Then I discovered the New World Order, the globalists, their agenda.
[01:31:22.987 --> 01:31:24.569]  I started an access television show.
[01:31:24.949 --> 01:31:29.754]  I was so dedicated to my work, and hanging around with radio guys, that I began drinking.
[01:31:30.335 --> 01:31:33.198]  I began smoking cigars, and then even cigarettes.
[01:31:33.698 --> 01:31:39.422]  I transformed from looking like a white Bruce Lee to looking like a job of the hut.
[01:31:39.782 --> 01:31:44.625]  So I began a journey five years ago to shed the almost 100 pounds.
[01:31:45.025 --> 01:31:49.908]  I started taking super male vitality and saw dramatic results in just a few weeks.
[01:31:50.188 --> 01:31:57.276]  When I added to the mix the key products developed by Dr. Groot for Infowarslife.com, the results were incredible.

[01:32:10.464 --> 01:32:11.684]  Another major health threat.
[01:32:11.724 --> 01:32:16.626]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[01:32:16.706 --> 01:32:19.327]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[01:32:19.367 --> 01:32:26.149]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[01:32:26.409 --> 01:32:29.270]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[01:32:29.390 --> 01:32:32.351]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[01:32:32.431 --> 01:32:34.351]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[01:32:34.371 --> 01:32:37.232]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[01:32:37.312 --> 01:32:42.814]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[01:32:43.034 --> 01:32:46.515]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[01:32:46.535 --> 01:32:49.536]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.

[01:33:07.381 --> 01:33:08.142]  Epic.
[01:33:08.322 --> 01:33:08.502]  Epic.
[01:33:08.682 --> 01:33:09.062]  Epic.
[01:33:09.222 --> 01:33:09.622]  Epic.
[01:33:15.485 --> 01:33:15.806]  Epic.
[01:33:16.766 --> 01:33:17.086]  Epic.
[01:33:18.187 --> 01:33:26.811]  We now take you live.
[01:33:27.832 --> 01:33:34.355]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[01:33:34.395 --> 01:33:35.796]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:37.890 --> 01:33:38.790]  Notice it's Texas.
[01:33:39.350 --> 01:33:42.151]  Ron Paul, Governor Abbott, myself, and many others.
[01:33:44.192 --> 01:33:46.112]  As Texas goes, so goes the nation.
[01:33:46.753 --> 01:33:49.853]  That was that way until the 60s, so they tried to make California the new bellwether.
[01:33:50.634 --> 01:33:51.894]  Taking the country down the toilet.
[01:33:53.454 --> 01:33:54.235]  With socialism.
[01:33:57.215 --> 01:33:58.836]  But it's very exciting what's happening.
[01:33:58.856 --> 01:34:00.076]  It's a great town to be alive.
[01:34:01.637 --> 01:34:02.497]  And I'm honored to be here.
[01:34:05.845 --> 01:34:10.846]  But when I overuse the word epic, it's because... Can we get a thesaurus out?
[01:34:14.347 --> 01:34:15.067]  Archetypal.
[01:34:15.467 --> 01:34:16.248]  Historical.
[01:34:18.248 --> 01:34:18.848]  Seismic.
[01:34:19.768 --> 01:34:20.629]  Ultra-massive.
[01:34:20.769 --> 01:34:21.849]  Incredibly important.
[01:34:23.209 --> 01:34:24.250]  World-changing.
[01:34:25.390 --> 01:34:26.090]  Over-the-top.
[01:34:27.210 --> 01:34:30.831]  What are other words associated with the word epic?
[01:34:33.472 --> 01:34:33.852]  Legend?
[01:34:36.075 --> 01:34:36.575]  Heroic?
[01:34:38.296 --> 01:34:39.637]  Yeah, it's legendary!
[01:34:39.697 --> 01:34:40.858]  That's a great word to use.
[01:34:42.178 --> 01:34:44.500]  What we are seeing now is the stuff of legends.
[01:34:46.261 --> 01:34:56.226]  And it will be the fall to the eugenics technocracy, the anti-human, global exterminist, rise of the machine-human interface takeover, in their own words.
[01:35:00.889 --> 01:35:04.631]  Or, it'll be the legendary
[01:35:06.042 --> 01:35:12.825]  Victory of humanity during this key time as we prepare to go to the next level.
[01:35:15.506 --> 01:35:29.591]  And all these preachers that are small-minded and have been in a war against science, they've played into the globalist's own plan to then set spiritual Christianity against science when it's a religion of transhumanism.
[01:35:30.580 --> 01:35:35.602]  And it's completely full of errors and frauds and changes all the time, but it wants to set itself up as the ultimate power.
[01:35:35.902 --> 01:35:57.730]  When the Bible says, the eye has not seen, ear has not heard the things that God has in store for us, and then I sit here and I believe in humanity and believe that after we go through these trials, we will then, our children and their children, be able to experience things that the eye has not seen, ear has not heard.
[01:36:02.165 --> 01:36:03.605]  As Christ said, I have other flocks.
[01:36:04.945 --> 01:36:09.686]  It truly is amazing what we can do.
[01:36:09.866 --> 01:36:16.507]  The word amazing, the word legend, the word epic, the word transcendent.
[01:36:17.888 --> 01:36:30.630]  These words do not really even begin to cut the surface of the well that is imagination, the water of life.
[01:36:32.142 --> 01:36:37.444]  Mystery, majesty, but we see that sparkle, that twinkle in the eyes of a child.
[01:36:39.746 --> 01:36:46.689]  I look at old black and white photos of poor Hispanic families, black families, poor white families, wealthy families, doesn't matter.
[01:36:47.229 --> 01:36:50.110]  They all had that twinkle in their eye.
[01:36:51.151 --> 01:36:55.633]  You take black and white photos today, even take them old style, that twinkle's not there.
[01:37:01.318 --> 01:37:05.739]  I have a twinkle in my eye, but not like the generations before me.
[01:37:08.660 --> 01:37:14.822]  And it's the soft kill, it's the chemicals, it's the drunkenness that we're under.
[01:37:15.182 --> 01:37:21.023]  The cultural, the spiritual, the chemical, the biological, the radiological, the electromagnetic, the scalar.
[01:37:24.824 --> 01:37:28.045]  Through just a blanket, a soup of intoxication.
[01:37:31.550 --> 01:37:33.390]  The eyes are the window to the soul.
[01:37:33.410 --> 01:37:38.332]  I mean, look into that window and we see a fog.
[01:37:38.892 --> 01:37:55.876]  I pray to God Almighty, the creator of the universe, the four corners of the planet, that if citizens and humans of this world seek your face and repent, even if we don't believe in God, we should repent for the way we act when we don't appreciate things.
[01:37:55.896 --> 01:37:56.916]  There's got to be some morals.
[01:37:58.567 --> 01:38:16.143]  And that this trance, this spell, this fog be lifted, that this scanner darkly be lifted, that the rose color darkly be lifted, if with free will people seek your face and pray and repent, and that humans can really see what they're facing.
[01:38:17.605 --> 01:38:20.968]  Because if you could see what you're facing, I'm talking to new listeners,
[01:38:21.837 --> 01:38:31.423]  There is not a doubt in my mind you'd do everything it took in the God's green earth to stop it and fight it, because it's so nasty.
[01:38:32.043 --> 01:38:34.164]  And every time I start thinking about the enemy, I get chills.
[01:38:34.525 --> 01:38:44.731]  Not chills of fear, just my soul, my God-fearing soul feels dirty even gazing into that abyss, and my soul shakes for fear of God.
[01:38:47.332 --> 01:38:47.972]  That's what that is.
[01:38:48.072 --> 01:38:49.313]  It's fear of God.
[01:38:49.433 --> 01:38:52.294]  It is, whoa, I feel so wicked even looking at that.
[01:38:53.194 --> 01:38:54.535]  Because that's the knowledge of good and evil.
[01:38:55.095 --> 01:38:56.776]  To know the enemy, I've fallen.
[01:38:57.856 --> 01:39:00.877]  It isn't that you didn't have free will in the metaphysical garden.
[01:39:03.418 --> 01:39:05.479]  We're all in that garden as children, we come out of it.
[01:39:11.921 --> 01:39:15.903]  It's that we're then given the knowledge of the evil technologies of
[01:39:17.921 --> 01:39:19.102]  Corruption of twisting.
[01:39:20.903 --> 01:39:23.104]  We're going to go to this special report with William Benny.
[01:39:23.604 --> 01:39:28.607]  Much of it is never before seen in a studio interview out on the street with Benny.
[01:39:28.667 --> 01:39:29.848]  It's very powerful.
[01:39:30.268 --> 01:39:31.509]  Interspersed with my interview with him.
[01:39:31.749 --> 01:39:33.030]  It's only ten and a half minutes long.
[01:39:33.570 --> 01:39:34.351]  It's going to be posted.
[01:39:34.371 --> 01:39:35.892]  I'm going to go ahead and post it today.
[01:39:35.972 --> 01:39:37.132]  Paul Watson already wrote the article.
[01:39:37.573 --> 01:39:39.854]  We're going to post it at Infowars.com in the next 30 minutes.
[01:39:39.894 --> 01:39:40.975]  It's going back up on YouTube.
[01:39:41.215 --> 01:39:42.295]  We're going to post it in his article.
[01:39:42.315 --> 01:39:43.116]  We're going to launch it now.
[01:39:43.396 --> 01:39:44.477]  Put it on Facebook and Twitter.
[01:39:44.717 --> 01:39:46.378]  We need you to get this out to everybody you know.
[01:39:49.206 --> 01:39:51.287]  I'll give you the headline name and more when we come back from break.
[01:39:51.307 --> 01:39:52.808]  It'll be up after this.
[01:39:53.589 --> 01:39:55.930]  And then please don't forget, we are Lister Supported.
[01:39:56.530 --> 01:39:58.351]  Please spread the word about the transmission.
[01:39:58.411 --> 01:40:01.713]  The enemy's doing everything they can to discredit us and attack us for a good reason.
[01:40:03.134 --> 01:40:06.856]  Go to InfoWarsLife.com or InfoWarsStore.com today.
[01:40:07.316 --> 01:40:09.458]  The sale ends today, 13 hours.
[01:40:09.518 --> 01:40:18.383]  I might extend it a day longer as folks always complain, but if you want to get in and get 50% off on two bottles of colloidal silver or free shipping on top of that and a free bottle of
[01:40:19.946 --> 01:40:22.648]  Fluoride Shield, that's 50% off, free shipping and a free bottle.
[01:40:22.668 --> 01:40:23.949]  I mean, we've never had a sale anywhere near this.
[01:40:24.149 --> 01:40:25.230]  We've got a bunch of other specials.
[01:40:25.430 --> 01:40:26.951]  They all end today.
[01:40:26.971 --> 01:40:31.234]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:40:31.855 --> 01:40:33.796]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:40:33.836 --> 01:40:37.699]  But now, here is our interview.
[01:40:38.680 --> 01:40:44.945]  The secrets of the NSA from the inside whistleblower who's been persecuted, William Benny, another true hero.
[01:40:47.694 --> 01:40:51.298]  The whole point is that under a surveillance state, you have very few liberties.
[01:40:52.619 --> 01:40:59.767]  Unless they, if they don't want you to have certain, do certain things, then they have ways and means of getting to you, like they did with us, or other people.
[01:41:00.027 --> 01:41:05.914]  They would find things to use against you, to leverage you, or influence you to do the, what they want you to do.
[01:41:06.734 --> 01:41:12.298]  You know, if you have nothing to hide, you have nothing to fear, well, that's a great quote from Joseph Goebbels, first of all.
[01:41:12.999 --> 01:41:15.240]  And secondly, it's totally irrelevant what you think.
[01:41:15.600 --> 01:41:17.121]  What you think is totally irrelevant.
[01:41:17.642 --> 01:41:18.863]  It means absolutely nothing.
[01:41:18.903 --> 01:41:24.927]  The government only considers its view of you, and if you're doing something they don't like, they will come after you, no matter what you think of it.
[01:41:28.553 --> 01:41:32.935]  Does the NSA routinely intercept American citizens' emails?
[01:41:33.735 --> 01:41:33.995]  No.
[01:41:34.595 --> 01:41:40.557]  Does the NSA intercept Americans' cell phone conversations?
[01:41:40.637 --> 01:41:40.857]  No.
[01:41:41.718 --> 01:41:42.578]  Google searches?
[01:41:43.418 --> 01:41:43.638]  No.
[01:41:44.278 --> 01:41:45.239]  Text messages?
[01:41:45.839 --> 01:41:46.059]  No.
[01:41:46.759 --> 01:41:49.140]  Amazon.com orders?
[01:41:49.240 --> 01:41:49.500]  No.
[01:41:49.800 --> 01:41:50.941]  Bank records?
[01:41:51.181 --> 01:41:51.301]  No.
[01:41:51.681 --> 01:42:00.045]  I thank you, and just for you, Director Clapper, again on the surveillance front, and I hope we can do this in just a yes or no answer, because I know Senator Feinstein wants to move on.
[01:42:00.065 --> 01:42:08.329]  Does the NSA collect any type of data at all on millions or hundreds of millions of Americans?
[01:42:09.430 --> 01:42:09.850]  No, sir.
[01:42:11.311 --> 01:42:11.771]  It does not.
[01:42:13.729 --> 01:42:14.549]  Not wittingly.
[01:42:15.930 --> 01:42:22.254]  There are cases where they could inadvertently, perhaps, collect, but not wittingly.
[01:42:22.914 --> 01:42:31.238]  But to conduct that kind of collection in the United States, it would have to go through a court order, and the court would have to authorize it.
[01:42:31.518 --> 01:42:34.100]  We're not authorized to do it, nor do we do it.
[01:42:37.722 --> 01:42:50.731]  Bill Binney, a legendary NSA mathematician, led development of a revolutionary computer system to collect, isolate, and connect important information, like phone calls and financial transactions.
[01:42:51.291 --> 01:42:53.233]  Its codename was ThinThread.
[01:42:53.733 --> 01:42:54.514]  My name is Bill Binney.
[01:42:55.635 --> 01:43:00.679]  I worked for NSA in the military and as a civilian for a little over 36 years.
[01:43:01.860 --> 01:43:08.325]  And I designed a lot of the logic and architecture that they're using to spy on everybody in the world.
[01:43:09.126 --> 01:43:12.809]  And when I started doing this and using it against US citizens, I became a whistleblower.
[01:43:13.749 --> 01:43:16.130]  I had other people who were with me as a part of that whistleblowing.
[01:43:16.170 --> 01:43:24.472]  I had four other people, including Diane Rourke from the House Intelligence Committee, and Tom Drake, Kirk Wiebe, and Ed Lewis, who were also NSA employees.
[01:43:25.132 --> 01:43:32.874]  So we were all part of that, and we tried to influence the government internally, and they attacked us for it, and tried to put us in jail, fabricated evidence.
[01:43:33.774 --> 01:43:35.255]  We caught them at it, so they failed.
[01:43:35.675 --> 01:43:43.400]  The FBI raided the homes of all the people you've met in this story, who filed that confidential complaint with the Defense Department.
[01:43:43.640 --> 01:43:44.741]  They came busting in.
[01:43:45.801 --> 01:43:53.526]  I was in the shower at the time, and one of them came running up and pointed a gun at my eyeballs.
[01:43:54.726 --> 01:43:55.627]  Pulled me out of the shower.
[01:43:56.027 --> 01:43:57.287]  So he drew a gun on you.
[01:43:57.768 --> 01:43:59.369]  Oh, yeah, he had it pointed at my head.
[01:43:59.389 --> 01:44:12.055]  Yeah He wrote how much courage you've got I mean, you know how serious people are in this government But they do worldwide how corrupt had gotten at that point You had the will to march into Congress and to tell them what was going on the first guy was
[01:44:12.695 --> 01:44:33.096]  That's ten times bigger than Snowden internally and to really start this whole internal debate in this avalanche of understanding now I mean you were really one of the first people to ring the bell to warn folks That that the country as we knew it was being dismantled I went to the terrorist analyst shop, which we had running there for quite some time, and I said I asked them
[01:44:35.104 --> 01:44:42.131]  In all the work you're doing to analyze the terrorist problem around the world, which sites are the ones that give you information that you find valuable?
[01:44:42.751 --> 01:44:51.559]  And so they gave me a list of 18 sites, and so I took those 18 sites and said, okay, these are the deployment targets for our process in January of 2001.
[01:44:53.321 --> 01:44:55.923]  And we estimated the cost to be about $9.5 million.
[01:44:55.943 --> 01:44:56.143]  That's all.
[01:44:59.335 --> 01:45:06.625]  Basically, it was working like a year and a half before 9-11 occurred, almost two years before 9-11.
[01:45:07.366 --> 01:45:09.769]  And if they'd have deployed it, we would have...
[01:45:10.982 --> 01:45:14.324]  We would have, in my view, there would have been no way we wouldn't have stopped 9-11.
[01:45:15.285 --> 01:45:21.928]  Because all the data, Tom Drake took the program after they killed it because it didn't cost enough money.
[01:45:22.129 --> 01:45:26.011]  So that meant that they had to create another program which they called Trailblazer.
[01:45:27.051 --> 01:45:28.893]  The initial cut at that was $4 billion.
[01:45:30.434 --> 01:45:33.337]  And after that, it only grew in terms of money.
[01:45:33.377 --> 01:45:34.578]  They kept getting more and more.
[01:45:35.438 --> 01:45:43.284]  So the whole point was that they had a whole host of contractors that wanted to feed on all that money.
[01:45:44.421 --> 01:45:48.164]  And if you took the program we did and deployed it, it would already solve the problem.
[01:45:48.444 --> 01:45:52.767]  So the point is that you can't go to Congress asking for money for a problem you've already solved.
[01:45:53.867 --> 01:45:59.171]  So they had to kill the solution to say we have a problem so they could justify getting the money.
[01:46:00.011 --> 01:46:01.312]  And that's exactly what they did.
[01:46:01.332 --> 01:46:03.093]  They know exactly what they're doing.
[01:46:03.113 --> 01:46:07.696]  And the reason you can tell that they know is because they're keeping it all secret.
[01:46:07.716 --> 01:46:10.118]  If they weren't really trying hard to keep it secret,
[01:46:11.356 --> 01:46:15.619]  Then you might think that they were delusional and they didn't understand what they were doing.
[01:46:15.699 --> 01:46:19.461]  But when they know that they're doing something wrong, they have to keep it secret.
[01:46:19.501 --> 01:46:22.603]  Otherwise, they feel that they're held accountable for what they do.
[01:46:23.663 --> 01:46:25.484]  Why else would they keep all these things secret?
[01:46:25.544 --> 01:46:27.565]  Do things in secret with a secret court?
[01:46:27.645 --> 01:46:29.306]  Keeping their interpretations secret?
[01:46:29.987 --> 01:46:33.389]  And making secret interpretations and rules for a constitution?
[01:46:33.949 --> 01:46:34.489]  In secret?
[01:46:35.270 --> 01:46:39.072]  And hiding it away from most of Congress and certainly all the public?
[01:46:40.325 --> 01:46:43.408]  So if you do that, you're hiding something and you know you're doing that.
[01:46:44.108 --> 01:46:45.569]  I put it down to three factors.
[01:46:46.270 --> 01:46:47.711]  Power, money, and control.
[01:46:48.752 --> 01:46:53.576]  That is, if you have an uninformed electorate and an uninformed Congress, you can manipulate them and control them.
[01:46:54.697 --> 01:47:02.043]  And especially if you're pulling in a lot of data about them, you can do that and use it against them to get them, to leverage them to do what you want them to do.
[01:47:05.495 --> 01:47:08.196]  Late last night, a British newspaper dropped a bombshell that the U.S.
[01:47:08.236 --> 01:47:11.737]  government has been collecting millions of Americans' phone records without them knowing about it.
[01:47:11.877 --> 01:47:17.099]  A lot of people are learning that the scope of these surveillance programs is immense.
[01:47:17.179 --> 01:47:25.261]  The government is monitoring private phone calls, your children and my children's private phone calls, and tracking who their associates are.
[01:47:25.501 --> 01:47:26.562]  Right now, the U.S.
[01:47:26.582 --> 01:47:32.443]  government knows who he is calling, where she is calling from, and how long they are talking.
[01:47:32.763 --> 01:47:34.324]  When it comes to telephone calls,
[01:47:36.036 --> 01:47:37.897]  Nobody is listening to your telephone calls.
[01:47:38.758 --> 01:47:45.761]  The NSA is trying to create a database to get ahead of what I think is a real growing threat.
[01:47:46.082 --> 01:47:49.623]  Homegrown terrorist cells are already here.
[01:47:49.724 --> 01:47:53.045]  It's to ferret this out before it happens.
[01:47:53.145 --> 01:47:55.247]  It's called protecting America.
[01:47:55.267 --> 01:48:01.490]  When it comes to keeping us safe in the war on terror, I think the President's program, President Obama's program, is the right one and it's a good one.
[01:48:01.710 --> 01:48:02.890]  His name is Edward Snowden.
[01:48:03.131 --> 01:48:06.352]  He's an American former CIA employee and computer technician.
[01:48:06.672 --> 01:48:10.093]  Today he came out as the leaker of classified NSA documents.
[01:48:10.353 --> 01:48:12.714]  You don't have to have done anything wrong.
[01:48:13.234 --> 01:48:17.696]  You simply have to eventually fall under suspicion from somebody, even by a wrong call.
[01:48:18.256 --> 01:48:23.398]  And then they can use the system to go back in time and scrutinize every decision you've ever made.
[01:48:23.658 --> 01:48:30.601]  Are you confident that you know everything that's going on within that agency and that you can say to the American people, it's all done the right way?
[01:48:31.484 --> 01:48:31.705]  Yes.
[01:48:35.207 --> 01:48:43.931]  I made the statement about that the greatest threat to our constitutional form of government since the Civil War is what's happening now in terms of spying in the United States.
[01:48:45.011 --> 01:48:49.733]  And that's the domestic spying program, Stellar Wind, that they started in secret and have been running in secret.
[01:48:50.674 --> 01:48:53.135]  So they're violating the constitutional rights of everyone.
[01:48:53.875 --> 01:49:00.318]  First Amendment rights are violated because you have the right under the First Amendment to have a free association.
[01:49:01.338 --> 01:49:04.839]  It doesn't say you have the right to free association as long as the government knows about it.
[01:49:04.999 --> 01:49:06.659]  That's a direct violation of that one.
[01:49:07.299 --> 01:49:19.162]  The Fourth Amendment is clearly violated when they collect all the content data or they digitally record your phone calls and violate all of your privacy under your affairs.
[01:49:19.522 --> 01:49:22.803]  That's a violation of the Fourth Amendment and then using the content of your emails
[01:49:23.483 --> 01:49:44.598]  Against you in a court of law in secret again under the law enforcement use of the NSA data That's a violation of your Fifth Amendment rights not to testify against yourself and then when they lie in courts and don't Don't tell you that give you the right to challenge discovery the information they really used to arrest you That's a violation of due process under the Sixth Amendment
[01:49:45.038 --> 01:49:48.702]  So, I mean, they're just scrapping the entire constitutional form of government.
[01:49:48.882 --> 01:49:57.111]  It's a great threat to our democracy and republic and constitutional form of government since the Civil War.
[01:49:57.691 --> 01:50:05.639]  See, unless we stop the industrial accumulation of information on people, we're heading to a state of society where
[01:50:06.660 --> 01:50:22.459]  People will see the surveillance just the fact that people are being surveilled Inhibits their their ability or feeling that they have the opportunity to do new and creative and innovative things So that kind of reduces their risk-taking basically
[01:50:23.420 --> 01:50:30.469]  Which in turn means you get less and less creativity and innovation, and more and more stagnation of civilization.
[01:50:31.089 --> 01:50:35.014]  That's what happened in the Soviet Union, that's what happened in East Germany, in the Communist bloc.
[01:50:35.655 --> 01:50:41.141]  They stagnated because people were being so surveilled that they were afraid to do anything.
[01:50:41.261 --> 01:50:43.043]  It made people afraid to take a risk.
[01:50:44.224 --> 01:50:47.125]  That's really the point of capitalism.
[01:50:47.145 --> 01:50:48.425]  That's why it's been so successful.
[01:50:48.445 --> 01:50:51.386]  Because it was advocating people taking risks.
[01:50:52.166 --> 01:50:58.768]  Americans aren't supposed to sit back and let things happen and let government do what it does.
[01:50:58.868 --> 01:51:00.348]  We're supposed to be out there challenging.
[01:51:00.388 --> 01:51:03.309]  We have to be participating in our democracy and republic.
[01:51:03.809 --> 01:51:06.390]  We cannot sit by and let these things happen and be quiet.
[01:51:06.450 --> 01:51:10.991]  If we do, we're going to get this totalitarian state that we're sliding toward right now.
[01:51:13.476 --> 01:51:14.737]  That's right, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:51:14.757 --> 01:51:27.143]  We're going to get this totalitarian state that we've already slidden off the edge into, but the reason it's so different than Nazi Germany or Soviet Russia or Maoist China is Maoist China had just been through World War II.
[01:51:28.543 --> 01:51:32.705]  The Japanese had killed, some estimates are as many as 10 million Chinese.
[01:51:33.766 --> 01:51:39.068]  There was mass poverty, millions starving to death every few months in some of that period.
[01:51:40.129 --> 01:51:42.530]  The country was in literal hell.
[01:51:44.372 --> 01:51:50.215]  And before that, the country had been broken in 14 parts by different Allied powers for 200 plus years.
[01:51:52.135 --> 01:51:55.537]  You could be publicly executed in China if you were caught stealing a bowl of rice.
[01:51:55.657 --> 01:51:57.278]  I mean, it was barbarous.
[01:51:58.478 --> 01:51:59.058]  Barbarous.
[01:51:59.979 --> 01:52:01.680]  China had not been barbarous previous to that.
[01:52:01.700 --> 01:52:03.781]  It had been quite cultured in many ways.
[01:52:05.461 --> 01:52:07.782]  But it was barbarous after colonialism.
[01:52:11.244 --> 01:52:13.705]  And so when Mao came in with Western support,
[01:52:15.865 --> 01:52:20.126]  Kicking out the Nationalists, who were pretty corrupt in their own right, but nothing compared to Mao.
[01:52:21.187 --> 01:52:24.268]  He was seen as a reformer by Wall Street, because he'd work with them.
[01:52:24.788 --> 01:52:27.089]  They thought he'd get things going under Communism.
[01:52:29.089 --> 01:52:31.310]  He was just able to absolutely steamroll everybody.
[01:52:31.890 --> 01:52:32.810]  Hitler, same deal.
[01:52:32.830 --> 01:52:40.813]  They've been through World War I, the Versailles Treaty, the massive depression that was estimated by many historians to be upwards of five times worse than the U.S.
[01:52:40.833 --> 01:52:41.233]  Depression.
[01:52:43.243 --> 01:52:46.445]  I mean Germany was starvation level for a decade.
[01:52:48.306 --> 01:52:49.667]  Very proud people went through hell.
[01:52:49.987 --> 01:52:53.889]  They were put under reparations where their companies were all turned over to foreign companies.
[01:52:55.250 --> 01:53:01.512]  Those foreign companies set Hitler up, put him in power, told him to invade, told him what to do, that's all been declassified, set him up.
[01:53:01.532 --> 01:53:04.132]  Doesn't mean Hitler wasn't horrible, he was terrible.
[01:53:04.352 --> 01:53:07.653]  They picked him to be the messianic leader, psychologically, of the Germans.
[01:53:07.713 --> 01:53:15.015]  Lord Milner in the twenties talked about, we gotta find a messianic German, wind him up, let him tear up Europe, and then we'll take over the ashes.
[01:53:15.035 --> 01:53:18.276]  I'm not saying the British people are inherently evil.
[01:53:18.856 --> 01:53:22.917]  I'm Welsh, I've got a lot of blood from England, on both sides of the family.
[01:53:22.937 --> 01:53:23.937]  The point is, is that
[01:53:25.040 --> 01:53:30.343]  The manipulations developed in England are the model of the world today.
[01:53:31.724 --> 01:53:33.044]  And they're very sophisticated.
[01:53:33.084 --> 01:53:34.305]  It's very hard to beat them.
[01:53:35.646 --> 01:53:37.347]  Because it's a 50 to 100 year plan.
[01:53:37.387 --> 01:53:41.689]  It's like the big mega banks have been funding liberation theology for about 80 years.
[01:53:42.169 --> 01:53:44.871]  They've been funding socialism and communism as the way to rebel.
[01:53:45.231 --> 01:53:50.794]  So when the revolution comes to their corrupt system, it'll be communism that they set offshore in control.
[01:53:51.823 --> 01:53:53.004]  I mean, it's hard to beat these people.
[01:53:53.044 --> 01:54:01.970]  In Brzezinski, I've read four of his books, no, five of his books, and in three of them, he talks about how they do 25, 50-year plans and everything I'm telling you.
[01:54:03.331 --> 01:54:05.893]  I mean, they think you're too stupid to read books they write.
[01:54:08.055 --> 01:54:20.204]  And he says in the future, in his last book, he also said it in two speeches to the Council on Foreign Relations of Canada and the U.S., he said it's more expensive now to propagandize people, we're just going to kill everybody.
[01:54:23.635 --> 01:54:27.277]  Zbigniew Brzezinski is probably a bigger advisor right now than Kissinger.
[01:54:29.058 --> 01:54:30.639]  George Sulz has gotten too senile.
[01:54:30.659 --> 01:54:34.361]  David Rockefeller now is officially senile at 98 or whatever it is.
[01:54:34.401 --> 01:54:35.522]  He's basically out of the game.
[01:54:37.103 --> 01:54:40.205]  That's why Senator Jay Rockefeller is leaving the Senate to actually run things now.
[01:54:40.905 --> 01:54:43.447]  Jay Rockefeller is one of the most powerful people in the world right now.
[01:54:44.167 --> 01:54:49.250]  The Rockefellers don't give you the power until the top dog, the top skeksy dies and then you get the power.
[01:54:49.270 --> 01:54:52.712]  A lot of evidence David had Nelson killed.
[01:54:55.888 --> 01:54:59.490]  But it's just unspeakable what we face.
[01:54:59.530 --> 01:55:10.636]  And I sit here with their manuals, their books, their admissions, they're just watching them control our world and then sit there and lecture the public on how none of this exists like we're five years old.
[01:55:13.430 --> 01:55:16.191]  Coming up in the next hour, I want to open the phones up.
[01:55:16.211 --> 01:55:17.331]  I haven't been taking a lot of calls lately.
[01:55:17.351 --> 01:55:20.593]  I want to talk to first-time callers about Jade Helm.
[01:55:21.473 --> 01:55:32.377]  And I want to do first-time callers at first that are active-duty police or military, or recently out, or who have a direct connection to Jade Helm, or have witnessed any military drills in your area.
[01:55:33.097 --> 01:55:39.240]  It's a pretty wide swath, but please don't call in if you're not those people, because I'd specifically like to hear from you.
[01:55:40.236 --> 01:55:51.767]  We'll launch the phone system over there on my Comrex, and we will start taking your phone calls at 800-259-9231.
[01:55:51.787 --> 01:55:52.768]  800-259-9231.
[01:55:56.372 --> 01:56:02.357]  Separately, if Buckley will come over to the microphone, I forget the exact headline that I wanted to give that William Binney piece.
[01:56:02.417 --> 01:56:03.719]  I'm sure it won't give it justice.
[01:56:07.130 --> 01:56:11.091]  But we're going to get it posted at Infowars.com and Paul Watson's article on the subject.
[01:56:11.131 --> 01:56:12.791]  Buckley, what headline did I come up with?
[01:56:14.312 --> 01:56:16.152]  Tell me what the subject was again.
[01:56:16.172 --> 01:56:18.893]  I'm just going to drill you guys.
[01:56:18.913 --> 01:56:20.553]  You're ready to come on air all the time when you're in there.
[01:56:23.494 --> 01:56:26.114]  We're going to kill the... Everybody's doing a great job back there.
[01:56:26.134 --> 01:56:27.655]  We're just going to exterminate the...
[01:56:29.212 --> 01:56:29.913]  Normalcy bias.
[01:56:30.794 --> 01:56:32.255]  It's the headline on the board in there.
[01:56:32.395 --> 01:56:38.902]  What headline did I decide to give the William Binney video that we just played?
[01:56:41.625 --> 01:56:44.528]  Former NSA head exposes agency's true crimes.
[01:56:45.128 --> 01:56:45.469]  There you go.
[01:56:46.290 --> 01:56:49.173]  Former NSA head exposes agency's true crimes.
[01:56:49.892 --> 01:56:50.252]  Exactly.
[01:56:50.272 --> 01:56:51.913]  I don't know if that's a good enough headline.
[01:56:52.653 --> 01:56:57.996]  But, former NSA head, we're going into tyranny?
[01:56:59.257 --> 01:56:59.557]  I don't know.
[01:57:00.817 --> 01:57:02.438]  I mean, it's just a very important report.
[01:57:03.018 --> 01:57:06.540]  How about, this is the video report you need to send your friends and family about the NSA.
[01:57:07.380 --> 01:57:09.842]  Or, most important NSA report ever.
[01:57:09.902 --> 01:57:12.443]  I mean, I really think it's the most crystallized, the most focused.
[01:57:12.883 --> 01:57:13.624]  I don't know what we call it.
[01:57:13.984 --> 01:57:17.405]  Watson's written an article, let's just give it to him and have him put it up on InfoWars.com.
[01:57:17.746 --> 01:57:18.466]  Thanks a million, guys.
[01:57:21.749 --> 01:57:23.850]  Let me point everybody to Infowars.com.
[01:57:25.151 --> 01:57:26.412]  I just knew Buckley was standing by the board.
[01:57:26.432 --> 01:57:27.332]  I'm sorry to put him on the spot.
[01:57:29.374 --> 01:57:30.794]  This is total transparency, though.
[01:57:30.895 --> 01:57:32.215]  I can't keep track of anything anymore.
[01:57:32.255 --> 01:57:33.056]  I'm going to be honest with you.
[01:57:33.656 --> 01:57:35.797]  There's too many things coming at us.
[01:57:35.858 --> 01:57:37.498]  Redlinked, Infowars.com.
[01:57:37.599 --> 01:57:42.341]  Very important article by Paul Joseph Watson and Alex Jones that we wrote this morning.
[01:57:42.842 --> 01:57:46.324]  Mainstream media rushes to demonize Infowars over Jade Helm.
[01:57:46.704 --> 01:57:47.945]  It just went live.
[01:57:49.451 --> 01:57:52.714]  And we show how they're lying to the public, and how to counter them.
[01:57:58.659 --> 01:58:03.823]  In fact, that's a good headline he gave it, but... Really, it's everything you need to know about Jade Helm.
[01:58:05.225 --> 01:58:06.786]  Or, use the media's tactic.
[01:58:06.886 --> 01:58:07.506]  Fact check!
[01:58:07.687 --> 01:58:10.229]  Is Jade Helm for domestic takeover or not?
[01:58:13.558 --> 01:58:16.279]  Because they play that reality game, like, we fact-checked.
[01:58:16.760 --> 01:58:26.144]  We've had all these different news agencies calling going, we need you to interview us, we're doing a fact-check on you, and we... David Knight got on the phone with one lady and he's like, okay, have you read the Jade Helm document?
[01:58:26.505 --> 01:58:29.186]  No, but we want to know your opinion of Jade Helm.
[01:58:29.586 --> 01:58:32.087]  Well, there is no opinion, Dumbo.
[01:58:32.588 --> 01:58:35.949]  We've got the documents and all the background material.
[01:58:35.969 --> 01:58:39.911]  It's like, well, it's your opinion there's death panels in Obamacare.
[01:58:40.151 --> 01:58:41.532]  No, it's in a stinking subsection.
[01:58:41.712 --> 01:58:42.933]  I'm going to smack you upside the head.
[01:58:43.922 --> 01:58:47.867]  We got the biggest specials ever running at InfoWarsLive.com right now.
[01:58:48.227 --> 01:58:52.192]  Free shipping on two bottles of X2 and a free bottle of Fluoride Shield.
[01:58:52.252 --> 01:58:53.693]  It ends in 12 hours.
[01:58:53.713 --> 01:58:55.015]  InfoWarsLive.com
[01:59:00.532 --> 01:59:01.092]  I want more candy!
[01:59:01.112 --> 01:59:02.212]  I want more video games!
[01:59:02.252 --> 01:59:03.473]  Mine, mine, mine!
[01:59:03.773 --> 01:59:13.155]  And it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and help children focus.
[01:59:13.515 --> 01:59:16.076]  All of our children are hit with modern mind control.
[01:59:16.216 --> 01:59:19.556]  Television, music, fast food, GMOs, sugars, you name it.
[01:59:19.756 --> 01:59:22.497]  Young humans have not yet developed their nervous system.
[01:59:22.657 --> 01:59:25.779]  And are being hammered daily by globulous concoctions.
[01:59:26.079 --> 01:59:30.941]  It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down and then are put on dangerous psychotropic drugs.
[01:59:31.222 --> 01:59:37.405]  Working with my team, we set out to find the best formula with the highest quality ingredients that children would actually like and take.
[01:59:37.605 --> 01:59:45.089]  We worked with the leading manufacturer in nutritional supplements that are safe for children to bring you the most affordable and powerful calming formula out there.
[01:59:45.349 --> 01:59:50.432]  Introducing Child Ease with herbs and calming extracts like chamomile and lemon balm.
[01:59:50.732 --> 01:59:52.934]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:00:16.499 --> 02:00:20.661]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:21.341 --> 02:00:22.142]  You want answers?
[02:00:22.922 --> 02:00:23.823]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:24.463 --> 02:00:28.105]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:28.665 --> 02:00:32.767]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:36.509 --> 02:00:40.952]  Ron Paul has never used rhetoric like that, but if it is a rose, it's a rose.
[02:00:43.382 --> 02:00:43.922]  Yellow dog?
[02:00:43.982 --> 02:00:44.763]  It's a yellow dog.
[02:00:44.863 --> 02:00:47.724]  If it's a 14-foot goblin, it's a 14-foot goblin.
[02:00:48.624 --> 02:00:50.305]  And if it's a tyrant, it's a tyrant.
[02:00:51.346 --> 02:00:54.167]  He said we're sliding into... What was the quote?
[02:00:54.187 --> 02:00:54.747]  What was the word?
[02:00:54.907 --> 02:00:55.928]  Total fascism?
[02:00:57.588 --> 02:01:04.452]  And then William Binning, the former head of technical at the NSA, he's like the master genius in a James Bond movie developing all this stuff.
[02:01:04.492 --> 02:01:23.225]  I went and saw Fast and Furious a few weeks ago to analyze it, and the whole thing was about the CIA having computer programs to use every cell phone, every appliance to track and watch everyone to save the earth, and how great total spying is, and how gang members can Mac Daddy the Homie G, Mac Mac Homie G, and just how cool it is.
[02:01:24.252 --> 02:01:27.053]  I mean, it is just the brainwashing.
[02:01:27.313 --> 02:01:30.473]  Oh, there is no illegal spying with the NSA through keywords.
[02:01:30.794 --> 02:01:32.114]  I mean, they're not recording anything.
[02:01:32.214 --> 02:01:33.414]  Alex Jones is a liar.
[02:01:33.814 --> 02:01:36.855]  And then now, oh yes, it's all true, but it's super cool.
[02:01:38.155 --> 02:01:38.795]  And the cars?
[02:01:39.936 --> 02:01:41.016]  Dodge Challengers.
[02:01:41.176 --> 02:01:45.337]  Hellcats can drive down five miles of a mountain jumping off cliffs.
[02:01:46.377 --> 02:01:48.658]  And the tires don't even blow and run over boulders.
[02:01:49.178 --> 02:01:50.218]  And Easter bunnies are real.
[02:01:51.834 --> 02:01:57.097]  But you've just got a bunch of child-like adults who are black guys, white guys, you name it, and they're going, yeah, right!
[02:01:57.397 --> 02:01:58.518]  Yeah, right!
[02:01:58.678 --> 02:01:59.819]  Oh, yeah!
[02:01:59.859 --> 02:02:02.180]  It's like going and seeing Avengers or something with my kids.
[02:02:02.200 --> 02:02:05.862]  I mean, I don't mind going and seeing a stupid make-believe movie, but guys are like, man, I love that guy.
[02:02:05.882 --> 02:02:06.643]  No, that's real.
[02:02:07.263 --> 02:02:08.123]  Oh, man.
[02:02:09.945 --> 02:02:12.126]  It's just like, wow, you can really see why they got us.
[02:02:13.632 --> 02:02:14.733]  I'm ranting, I apologize.
[02:02:15.133 --> 02:02:18.276]  I want to talk to military police, folks that have seen military activity in their area.
[02:02:18.617 --> 02:02:22.280]  What do you think of the Jade Helm demonization program that's going on?
[02:02:25.441 --> 02:02:34.487]  I want to shoot a special report today if I have time, where I do almost like a parody of the fact-check shows on NBC News, like, let's fact-check it.
[02:02:34.507 --> 02:02:35.328]  I'm like our fact-checker.
[02:02:35.588 --> 02:02:36.509]  Lie or fact?
[02:02:36.989 --> 02:02:38.130]  Like behind me on the screen?
[02:02:38.891 --> 02:02:42.273]  And I go, okay, the military's not trained for domestic operations.
[02:02:42.613 --> 02:02:52.680]  And then just show all the clips of the riot troops and the preparations and everything else and the manuals and everything and go, wow, that's a total lie!
[02:02:53.721 --> 02:02:56.283]  Now let's, where people ask, are you training to take guns?
[02:02:56.743 --> 02:03:01.026]  And then we can show all the manuals and the training and Katrina and go, wow, that's a total lie!
[02:03:01.046 --> 02:03:07.129]  Now let's see where they say that I said total martial laws happening this summer and Obama will invade and take over.
[02:03:07.590 --> 02:03:08.910]  So when it doesn't happen, I'm discredited.
[02:03:09.271 --> 02:03:14.454]  And then we show where I'm saying, I'm not saying it'll be total martial laws, part of the conditioning, long term.
[02:03:14.474 --> 02:03:16.515]  I go, oh, total lie!
[02:03:16.635 --> 02:03:17.135]  Wow!
[02:03:17.536 --> 02:03:18.156]  Fact check!
[02:03:18.236 --> 02:03:21.258]  You're full of... Bravo Sierra!
[02:03:24.448 --> 02:03:27.050]  I want to go to Jack, Adam, Wild, Luke and others.
[02:03:27.311 --> 02:03:28.492]  I don't want to cut any of you short.
[02:03:30.233 --> 02:03:34.577]  So I want to get specifically people that are witnessing Jade Helm type operations.
[02:03:34.998 --> 02:03:41.764]  The videos are pouring in of the riot troops in Tennessee and California and Texas and New York training to club the heads of the patriots.
[02:03:42.184 --> 02:03:45.367]  We're going to go over all of this coming up after the break.
[02:03:46.168 --> 02:03:50.232]  And we're just going to continue to document what's happening.
[02:03:51.255 --> 02:03:58.946]  But, when you look at the Dallas Morning News, The Austin Record Statesman, Politico, Bloomberg, they are preying on their audience.
[02:03:59.006 --> 02:04:04.474]  They get a script from the PR firm, so it's not directly from the Pentagon, because that might freak out the reporters.
[02:04:06.107 --> 02:04:08.288]  Here are the talking points on these tinfoils, hey.
[02:04:08.588 --> 02:04:10.610]  Here you go, Martha, write your article, hey.
[02:04:10.910 --> 02:04:14.692]  She don't know soon they got a computer gonna write it with fake Nome diplomes.
[02:04:15.172 --> 02:04:17.493]  I bet she doesn't even know what a Nome diplome is.
[02:04:19.074 --> 02:04:21.135]  Help take a bite out of the constitutions.
[02:04:21.496 --> 02:04:22.376]  What I like for you.
[02:04:23.096 --> 02:04:26.638]  And then they go and they take the talking points and they weave them into the article.
[02:04:27.159 --> 02:04:30.300]  And then they shovel the Bravo Sierra onto their friends and family.
[02:04:31.261 --> 02:04:34.783]  Not knowing they're part of the same country sinking into the quicksand of tyranny.
[02:04:35.600 --> 02:04:40.143]  They don't know people like the New World Order have already built their redoubts offshore.
[02:04:42.705 --> 02:04:51.431]  It's like a pelican trying to eat a fish.
[02:04:52.112 --> 02:04:53.633]  I gotta stop eating during the breaks.
[02:04:53.713 --> 02:04:55.974]  I just gotta learn I can't eat during the three hours of my breaks.
[02:04:56.455 --> 02:05:00.037]  Plus they got me a stuffed jalapeno with crusty outside.
[02:05:00.057 --> 02:05:03.140]  This needs to all be like old people's soup or something.
[02:05:04.304 --> 02:05:05.525]  All right, we'll be right back.
[02:05:05.545 --> 02:05:09.187]  Stay with us, InfoWars.com.
[02:05:10.448 --> 02:05:22.275]  The Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press and eight news media organizations have formed a coalition to demand that a federal court in North Carolina unseal a sentencing memorandum and related letters in the case of David Petraeus.
[02:05:22.556 --> 02:05:27.659]  The court document says, the public has an especially strong interest in obtaining a full understanding.
[02:05:27.879 --> 02:05:29.240]  But what did Petraeus leak?
[02:05:29.580 --> 02:05:30.981]  Seven black books.
[02:05:31.381 --> 02:05:42.384]  They contained classified information regarding the identities of covert officers, war strategy, intelligence capabilities, quotes, and deliberative discussions from high-level National Security Council meetings.
[02:05:42.644 --> 02:05:50.186]  But compare Petraeus' punishment to what John Kiriakou, a CIA officer who exposed the CIA's illegal torture program, got.
[02:05:50.506 --> 02:05:55.207]  The whistleblower got two years in jail for exposing government crime, but the general
[02:05:55.447 --> 02:06:03.551]  who exposed information that really could have hurt national security, got a fine equivalent to 75% of what he gets paid for a single speech.
[02:06:03.831 --> 02:06:06.532]  And not two years in prison, but two years probation.
[02:06:06.672 --> 02:06:09.774]  For InfoWars.com and Prison Planet TV, I'm David Knight.
[02:06:10.473 --> 02:06:15.494]  Introducing Secret 12, the new InfoWarsLife vitamin B12 formulation.
[02:06:15.614 --> 02:06:21.496]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimedical grade, bioavailable, coenzyme forms of B12.
[02:06:21.736 --> 02:06:26.337]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections, and adenosylcobalamin.
[02:06:26.517 --> 02:06:29.818]  Secret 12 is simply taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.
[02:06:30.078 --> 02:06:31.658]  No needles, no injections.
[02:06:32.058 --> 02:06:36.679]  Secure your revolutionary Secret 12 formula right now at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[02:06:40.320 --> 02:06:40.941]  Alex Jones here.
[02:06:41.341 --> 02:06:50.387]  For the last two years, I've been working with top doctors, nutritionists, and chemists to design a nutraceutical formulation that has truly life-changing health benefits.
[02:06:50.627 --> 02:06:54.149]  Introducing the all-new Ancient Defense Herbal Immunity Blend.
[02:06:54.430 --> 02:07:02.415]  Experience the benefits of combining over 14 ancient herbs and extracts with exciting new advances in nutraceutical science.

[02:07:05.077 --> 02:07:06.117]  That's Infowarslife.com.
[02:07:10.360 --> 02:07:11.301]  Hi, I'm Alex Jones.
[02:07:11.461 --> 02:07:15.285]  When I got on air 20 years ago, I weighed 180 pounds.
[02:07:15.725 --> 02:07:17.426]  I lift weights five days a week.
[02:07:17.847 --> 02:07:19.148]  I could swim two, three miles.
[02:07:19.488 --> 02:07:22.411]  Then I discovered the New World Order, the globalists, their agenda.
[02:07:22.651 --> 02:07:24.232]  I started an access television show.
[02:07:24.633 --> 02:07:29.417]  I was so dedicated to my work and hanging around with radio guys that I began drinking.
[02:07:30.017 --> 02:07:32.860]  I began smoking cigars and then even cigarettes.
[02:07:33.380 --> 02:07:39.105]  I transformed from looking like a white Bruce Lee to looking like a job of the hut.
[02:07:39.445 --> 02:07:44.290]  So I began a journey five years ago to shed the almost 100 pounds.
[02:07:44.710 --> 02:07:49.614]  I started taking super male vitality and saw dramatic results in just a few weeks.
[02:07:49.875 --> 02:07:51.316]  When I added to the mix
[02:07:51.676 --> 02:07:55.582]  The key products developed by Dr. Group for Infowarslife.com.
[02:07:55.862 --> 02:07:56.964]  The results were incredible.
[02:07:57.284 --> 02:08:02.411]  Take the Infowarslife.com challenge today at Infowarslife.com or give our crew a call.
[02:08:02.611 --> 02:08:05.576]  They can answer all your questions or tell you about any of the specials at 888-253-3139.
[02:08:18.291 --> 02:08:22.964]  Another time, in the age of wonder.
[02:08:37.825 --> 02:08:41.748]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:08:42.448 --> 02:08:46.411]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:08:46.551 --> 02:08:53.337]  All was well in the Republic, until we got the private run for profit, federal reserve, and the income tax.
[02:08:54.357 --> 02:09:02.604]  We are now the used up husk of the once great Republic, our blood, sweat, and tears used to build the Cybertronic World Government.
[02:09:06.028 --> 02:09:10.690]  Only now, at the end, do we begin to realize the grave peril we're in.
[02:09:12.450 --> 02:09:14.051]  Yes, truth is stranger than fiction.
[02:09:14.071 --> 02:09:15.111]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[02:09:15.491 --> 02:09:16.551]  We're taking your phone calls.
[02:09:16.571 --> 02:09:18.112]  There has been a full-out assault.
[02:09:18.952 --> 02:09:21.373]  Hundreds of articles per day.
[02:09:21.393 --> 02:09:24.174]  Go put the word Jade Hellman.
[02:09:25.134 --> 02:09:26.194]  Click Google News.
[02:09:27.215 --> 02:09:28.095]  Click under it.
[02:09:28.915 --> 02:09:30.036]  See all stories.
[02:09:30.196 --> 02:09:31.096]  It's thousands.
[02:09:33.722 --> 02:09:35.883]  365 the last 24 hours with my name in it.
[02:09:37.463 --> 02:09:38.464]  Hundreds more today.
[02:09:38.944 --> 02:09:40.125]  Hundreds the day before that.
[02:09:40.365 --> 02:09:43.546]  Thousands a week with the same talking points.
[02:09:47.008 --> 02:09:48.808]  The same talking points.
[02:09:50.749 --> 02:10:00.474]  Over and over and over and over again saying that we are saying martial law is imminent, they're going to take our guns.
[02:10:00.654 --> 02:10:00.914]  Nope!
[02:10:02.543 --> 02:10:17.629]  We said they are training to acclimate the public towards militarization, TSA on the streets, training the military to be on the streets, towards gun confiscation at some point down the road, pre-deploying armored vehicles, and saying they're for gun owners, veterans, conservatives, and libertarians.
[02:10:17.969 --> 02:10:27.634]  Do I need to play in Indiana, and Tennessee, and California, and Washington State, the police saying the armored vehicles are for the veterans when they've done nothing?
[02:10:28.134 --> 02:10:30.795]  And lying and saying there's veteran crime sprees when there's not?
[02:10:32.281 --> 02:10:34.542]  Don't I need to have Professor John Lawn on with the statistics?
[02:10:34.842 --> 02:10:35.362]  None of it's true!
[02:10:37.763 --> 02:10:39.044]  No, you've all heard him over and over again.
[02:10:39.064 --> 02:10:40.924]  I played with him a bunch last hour, but I'm gonna go to your calls.
[02:10:41.305 --> 02:10:43.185]  Jack, Mary, Adam, Wild, Luke, and others.
[02:10:43.385 --> 02:10:44.566]  But right now, let's cue it up.
[02:10:45.728 --> 02:10:46.688]  Let's play Indiana.
[02:10:46.728 --> 02:10:47.729]  Let's play Washington.
[02:10:48.209 --> 02:10:55.171]  Let's play, just from two weeks ago, the National Guard training to attack sovereign citizens at the dirty bomb drill they said we couldn't be part of.
[02:10:55.191 --> 02:10:56.712]  Because it wasn't a dirty bomb drill.
[02:10:57.872 --> 02:11:00.073]  Other than saying that the Patriots were going to dirty bomb.
[02:11:00.854 --> 02:11:04.615]  Let's go ahead and play what... I mean, you go to any of these, this is what they're doing.
[02:11:05.572 --> 02:11:06.753]  Nothing's happening!
[02:11:07.073 --> 02:11:08.234]  There's no death panels.
[02:11:08.474 --> 02:11:09.514]  There's no debt limit.
[02:11:09.915 --> 02:11:12.156]  There's no secret no-treat list for the veterans.
[02:11:12.536 --> 02:11:13.737]  There's no open borders.
[02:11:14.097 --> 02:11:15.078]  Obama loves you.
[02:11:15.358 --> 02:11:16.478]  He cares about you.
[02:11:17.119 --> 02:11:17.899]  Everything's fine.
[02:11:17.939 --> 02:11:18.560]  Go to sleep.
[02:11:18.600 --> 02:11:19.900]  Hillary Clinton's a war hero.
[02:11:21.101 --> 02:11:25.984]  Brian Williams single-handedly killed 85 Taliban himself with a dagger.
[02:11:28.025 --> 02:11:31.167]  He was in a helicopter shot down by Yosemite Sam.
[02:11:34.209 --> 02:11:36.390]  Just believe what they say or they'll call you racist.
[02:11:36.431 --> 02:11:38.892]  Well, then call me racist, you pack of scum!
[02:11:40.073 --> 02:11:41.314]  Let's go ahead and go to these clips.
[02:11:42.034 --> 02:11:45.537]  We really didn't have the violence that we see today.
[02:11:46.337 --> 02:11:51.161]  The weaponry is totally different now than it was in the beginning of my career.
[02:11:51.921 --> 02:11:59.987]  Plus, you have a lot of people that are coming out of the military that have the ability and the knowledge to build IEDs and to defeat law enforcement techniques.
[02:12:00.027 --> 02:12:00.827]  What's the problem here?
[02:12:00.847 --> 02:12:02.008]  Can I do something about it?
[02:12:05.077 --> 02:12:06.978]  They're training exactly for what?
[02:12:07.458 --> 02:12:14.522]  I'm a sovereign citizen.
[02:12:15.002 --> 02:12:16.963]  I refuse to recognize you guys.
[02:12:17.123 --> 02:12:19.664]  I refuse to recognize you.
[02:12:19.845 --> 02:12:22.046]  I'm a sovereign citizen.
[02:12:22.066 --> 02:12:24.207]  That's the cute attack on the batons.
[02:12:27.192 --> 02:12:30.613]  So I'm thinking that is totally appropriate in Iraq, but what kind of a situation in the U.S.
[02:12:30.733 --> 02:12:32.254]  would you see that happening?
[02:12:32.374 --> 02:12:38.096]  I mean, we've got a lot of constitutionalists, a lot of people that stockpile weapons, a lot of ammunition.
[02:12:55.911 --> 02:12:59.914]  I mean, we've got a lot of Constitutionalists and a lot of people that stockpile weapons.
[02:12:59.934 --> 02:13:01.595]  A lot of ammunition.
[02:13:01.635 --> 02:13:04.917]  They have no weapons here locally.
[02:13:05.117 --> 02:13:07.338]  So what happens if the PLR take over?
[02:13:07.538 --> 02:13:09.139]  A country run by terrorists ain't good.
[02:13:09.980 --> 02:13:13.102]  Bro, America was founded by terrorists for terrorists.
[02:13:13.122 --> 02:13:16.104]  What do you think the f*** Revolutionary War was?
[02:13:16.684 --> 02:13:19.506]  History is determined by the f*** you pick.
[02:13:19.826 --> 02:13:21.507]  How did you even get into the Marines?
[02:13:21.807 --> 02:13:24.089]  Who was the first terrorist organization in the United States?
[02:13:29.176 --> 02:13:31.558]  You mean Thomas Jefferson?
[02:13:31.798 --> 02:13:34.480]  You mean George Washington?
[02:13:34.620 --> 02:13:35.280]  Paul Revere?
[02:13:36.261 --> 02:13:40.284]  These guys right here, let me ask you something.
[02:13:40.324 --> 02:13:42.785]  Did they try to scare people?
[02:13:43.406 --> 02:13:45.787]  They tried to intimidate the British?
[02:13:45.827 --> 02:13:47.188]  Did they use acts of violence?
[02:13:47.568 --> 02:13:52.832]  Your father and father, my father and father, were involved in acts of terrorism against British officials.
[02:13:54.008 --> 02:13:57.411]  Jade Helm troops who operate undetected amongst civilian population.
[02:13:57.911 --> 02:14:00.394]  And of course, the military people and the vets are not buying any of it.
[02:14:00.414 --> 02:14:00.994]  They're not stupid.
[02:14:01.334 --> 02:14:06.999]  You can read about how it's to get the hearts and minds and how to get the public used to working and the local police working with the military.
[02:14:07.460 --> 02:14:13.305]  I mean, everybody who's been in the military knows about the secret EOD program going on for 18 years.
[02:14:13.705 --> 02:14:17.809]  Their whole ordinance disposal, quote, the army is going to show up to defuse a bomb.
[02:14:18.601 --> 02:14:20.562]  But then you get the internal agreements.
[02:14:20.682 --> 02:14:28.247]  It's for everything from warrant service to checkpoints with military personnel in nondescript blue jumpsuits.
[02:14:28.388 --> 02:14:33.011]  Just like the Army Ranger called in and said they were wearing EPA blue jumpsuits.
[02:14:33.111 --> 02:14:35.813]  It's always blue or tan jumpsuits.
[02:14:36.613 --> 02:14:38.294]  And it might say EPA.
[02:14:38.394 --> 02:14:39.555]  It might say police.
[02:14:40.596 --> 02:14:41.857]  It might say park serfs.
[02:14:42.837 --> 02:15:01.023]  Training with the police, training with locals, in plain clothes, quote, doing suspicious activities, is to train the police to work with the military in covert operations, and to condition the military to accept it, and to condition the public to accept it, and then when we cover it and talk about it, they practice the PSYOP in real time, putting out this information.
[02:15:01.083 --> 02:15:12.266]  I can see the script from Army Times, to Military.com, to Stars and Stripes, to Bloomberg, to Daily Beast, to Vice, to the Houston Chronicle, and no exaggeration today.
[02:15:14.353 --> 02:15:16.146]  You go search Jade Helm.
[02:15:19.042 --> 02:15:23.686]  There are now hundreds of articles, and in almost all of them, yours truly is being demonized.
[02:15:23.746 --> 02:15:24.406]  That was a month ago.
[02:15:24.426 --> 02:15:28.009]  Jones has warned of an imminent takeover for decades.
[02:15:28.169 --> 02:15:30.852]  Keeps claiming it's gonna happen, but of course it never does.
[02:15:31.032 --> 02:15:32.593]  No, it never does!
[02:15:32.993 --> 02:15:44.243]  Checkpoints, TSA, open spying, highway dividers being put up nationwide, open manuals that the number one enemies, veterans and gun owners and Christians, I mean, come on!
[02:15:45.884 --> 02:15:46.925]  This is the PSYOP!
[02:15:51.778 --> 02:15:52.959]  I want to go to your phone calls.
[02:15:53.300 --> 02:15:56.222]  Remember, I'm going to get into economic news and a bunch of other Monsanto news.
[02:15:57.744 --> 02:16:12.317]  Monsanto has been caught, it's on InfoWars.com, it's come out in court, paying farmers to bio-attack with their weapons, with their seeds, that's what they are, to then be able to charge those farms with stealing Monsanto technology.
[02:16:13.138 --> 02:16:27.746]  And farmers kept saying, you know, it grows up in the ditches by our houses, even when there's not a neighbor growing it, it gets in the middle of our fields, and then Monsanto flies over with airplanes, drop, this is a National Geographic, you don't believe me, it's crazy, drops Roundup bombs
[02:16:30.405 --> 02:16:38.775]  On your crops, without a warrant, it's how above the law they are, it'll kill a huge area, and if one plant's still alive, they then go pick it and know that that's their plant.
[02:16:39.456 --> 02:16:47.325]  And they hire former FBI agents, mainly, to go around and grab the plants, and then they sue you, just so you'll get intimidated and buy their crops.
[02:16:54.887 --> 02:16:56.128]  Infowars.com.
[02:16:56.188 --> 02:17:00.913]  Monsanto secretly gave money to farmer caught contaminating organic farms with GMOs.
[02:17:00.953 --> 02:17:03.335]  Now admits it's paying for GMO farmers legal defense.
[02:17:04.336 --> 02:17:06.117]  Gotta get Percy Schmeisser if he's still alive.
[02:17:06.137 --> 02:17:10.101]  I said that because he was old and it was like 1999 or something.
[02:17:10.121 --> 02:17:10.821]  I got him on.
[02:17:12.048 --> 02:17:14.010]  Oh, it's definitely here, man.
[02:17:14.030 --> 02:17:16.211]  Thank you so much for taking my call.
[02:17:39.276 --> 02:17:40.877]  Yeah, I have a few things.
[02:17:40.897 --> 02:17:45.359]  Okay, Boston bombing, that was the first test of martial law.
[02:17:46.179 --> 02:17:58.944]  Then you go on to Ferguson, and then, you know, you got Philly, Baltimore, all these protests that are turning into riots, probably outside provocateurs.
[02:17:58.964 --> 02:18:00.585]  Oh, they're totally fuming about George Soros.
[02:18:00.605 --> 02:18:01.065]  It's on record.
[02:18:02.011 --> 02:18:05.374]  Right, I've seen them, yeah, on TV or on YouTube.
[02:18:05.954 --> 02:18:16.943]  But, um, I'm thinking Jade Helm, you know, these soldiers, maybe they're, you know, those soldiers that we've seen training are probably the ones that are stationed at all these riots right now.
[02:18:17.924 --> 02:18:18.565]  That's my thought.
[02:18:20.248 --> 02:18:29.296]  A lot of them are, but this is to get special ops ready to take over local government and to identify, even the special ops are compartmentalized, they don't know why they're there.
[02:18:29.316 --> 02:18:31.718]  This is to identify which cities and counties are going to work with them.
[02:18:32.499 --> 02:18:37.063]  Just like Katrina was there to see, can we actually order gun confiscation without resistance?
[02:18:37.644 --> 02:18:39.305]  It's all laboratory testing.
[02:18:39.586 --> 02:18:41.768]  The globalists are scientists first and foremost.
[02:18:41.828 --> 02:18:43.889]  It's a scientific dictatorship.
[02:18:43.909 --> 02:18:45.991]  They call themselves technocrats.
[02:18:46.852 --> 02:18:49.273]  And Steve, understand, everything is a psych test.
[02:18:49.413 --> 02:18:50.553]  Everything is a test.
[02:18:52.093 --> 02:18:58.755]  Like, look into it 10,000 different ways to truly try to understand what the hell they're thinking, you know?
[02:18:59.215 --> 02:19:03.176]  But yeah, I just, I just seen, you know, a pattern that they're all, it's all together.
[02:19:03.696 --> 02:19:05.616]  Jade Helm, it's probably the same people.
[02:19:06.276 --> 02:19:08.337]  And I want to end it on a good note.
[02:19:08.637 --> 02:19:10.977]  They got 50% of the fluoride out of the water.
[02:19:11.537 --> 02:19:12.057]  That's awesome.
[02:19:12.077 --> 02:19:13.438]  But why not just take it all out?
[02:19:13.458 --> 02:19:14.378]  Because it's bad, you know?
[02:19:14.969 --> 02:19:16.430]  Well, they can't admit they're wrong.
[02:19:16.450 --> 02:19:19.353]  The panels have actually recommended get rid of all of it.
[02:19:19.753 --> 02:19:21.494]  And to stop using the toxic form.
[02:19:21.514 --> 02:19:22.916]  If they were putting...
[02:19:24.621 --> 02:19:29.883]  Calcium fluoride in the water, I'd be against it because it sets the precedent to put drugs in the water, but it would actually be good for you at low levels.
[02:19:30.323 --> 02:19:35.744]  It's hydrofluorosilicic acid that's been electrically charged and is deadly poison.
[02:19:35.785 --> 02:19:37.265]  I mean, one drop will kill you deader than a hammer.
[02:19:37.685 --> 02:19:39.005]  It's almost as deadly as cyanide.
[02:19:39.266 --> 02:19:40.266]  It eats through concrete.
[02:19:40.486 --> 02:19:41.306]  It eats through steel.
[02:19:42.867 --> 02:19:45.407]  It's almost as bad as sulfuric acid.
[02:19:46.648 --> 02:19:50.329]  I mean, it is over the top bad.
[02:19:50.949 --> 02:19:53.730]  But yes, they're banning it as a pesticide.
[02:19:55.674 --> 02:19:58.578]  Because most of these EPA scientists don't like having brain damaged kids.
[02:19:58.618 --> 02:20:00.461]  I mean, they're scientists, they know it's bad.
[02:20:01.122 --> 02:20:03.004]  Most people in government actually know what's going on.
[02:20:03.105 --> 02:20:04.927]  That's the most awake group's government.
[02:20:05.268 --> 02:20:07.491]  But it's the head people, they're the enemy.
[02:20:10.458 --> 02:20:12.859]  Hunters, anglers, campers and survivalists.
[02:20:13.059 --> 02:20:14.000]  Get back to nature.

[02:21:10.023 --> 02:21:10.984]  Hi, I'm Alex Jones.
[02:21:11.164 --> 02:21:18.828]  When I got on air 20 years ago, I weighed 180 pounds, I lift weights 5 days a week, I can swim 2-3 miles.
[02:21:19.188 --> 02:21:22.110]  Then I discovered the New World Order, the globalists, their agenda.
[02:21:22.350 --> 02:21:23.911]  I started an access television show.
[02:21:24.311 --> 02:21:29.074]  I was so dedicated to my work and hanging around with radio guys that I began drinking.
[02:21:29.694 --> 02:21:32.558]  I began smoking cigars and then even cigarettes.
[02:21:33.078 --> 02:21:38.805]  I transformed from looking like a white Bruce Lee to looking like a Jabba the Hutt.
[02:21:39.145 --> 02:21:43.991]  So I began a journey five years ago to shed the almost 100 pounds.
[02:21:44.411 --> 02:21:49.297]  I started taking Super Mel Vitality and saw dramatic results in just a few weeks.
[02:21:49.557 --> 02:21:56.641]  When I added to the mix the key products developed by Dr. Group for InfoWarsLife.com, the results were incredible.
[02:21:56.961 --> 02:22:02.104]  Take the InfoWarsLife.com challenge today at InfoWarsLife.com or give our crew a call.

[02:22:10.049 --> 02:22:14.392]  Healthy elimination is essential to high energy, a cheerful mood, and prevention of disease.
[02:22:14.512 --> 02:22:19.254]  Some of the founders of our modern holistic health thinking state that disease begins in a toxic colon.
[02:22:19.374 --> 02:22:23.257]  A toxic intestinal tract is the foundation for virtually all degenerative disease.
[02:22:23.417 --> 02:22:26.839]  And a clean and well-moving intestinal tract is the foundation of health.
[02:22:27.079 --> 02:22:29.620]  I just want to say that you folks have an amazing product.
[02:22:29.740 --> 02:22:34.121]  I've taken whey protein products for years, and I've never noticed results I have with your product.
[02:22:34.201 --> 02:22:37.161]  I've suffered with thoughts of constipation most of my life.
[02:22:37.401 --> 02:22:41.282]  Within a few days of taking One World Whey, I noticed a dramatic change.
[02:22:41.702 --> 02:22:45.403]  Also, in the past few years, I've experienced symptoms associated with diabetes.
[02:22:45.423 --> 02:22:49.084]  I feel horrible when I've had too much sugar, and I've been getting the foot pain as well.
[02:22:49.704 --> 02:22:50.064]  Call 888-988-3325.

[02:23:09.196 --> 02:23:10.277]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:23:10.437 --> 02:23:14.760]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[02:23:14.941 --> 02:23:20.525]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[02:23:20.625 --> 02:23:24.028]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[02:23:24.188 --> 02:23:26.790]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[02:23:27.010 --> 02:23:31.753]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[02:23:31.894 --> 02:23:32.174]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:23:32.194 --> 02:23:33.515]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[02:23:39.315 --> 02:23:40.116]  This is Dan Pilla.
[02:23:40.136 --> 02:23:41.617]  Do you owe the IRS money you can't pay?
[02:23:41.937 --> 02:23:43.218]  Are tax debts crippling you?
[02:23:43.578 --> 02:23:45.900]  I've defended people from the IRS for over 30 years.
[02:23:46.401 --> 02:23:48.242]  I've helped thousands and I can help you too.
[02:23:48.702 --> 02:23:52.745]  I wrote the book on IRS settlement and I'm telling you, there's no such thing as a hopeless case.
[02:23:53.206 --> 02:23:56.909]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX to finally get free of IRS debt.
[02:23:57.149 --> 02:24:00.592]  With the IRS's new programs, there's never been a better time to solve your problem.
[02:24:00.932 --> 02:24:01.332]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX.
[02:24:01.352 --> 02:24:02.673]  That's 800-34-NO-TAX or my website, danpilla.com.
[02:24:22.043 --> 02:24:27.707]  Yes, well, sometimes Satan... ...comes as a man of peace!
[02:24:27.807 --> 02:24:29.848]  First, he's in the back.
[02:24:50.148 --> 02:24:51.089]  Luke... Wild!
[02:25:06.733 --> 02:25:09.414]  Adam, Mary, Dean, we're going to all of you.
[02:25:09.514 --> 02:25:10.355]  Luke on the air.
[02:25:11.455 --> 02:25:13.476]  It's bigger than just Jade Helm, isn't it, Luke?
[02:25:13.676 --> 02:25:15.937]  I mean, it's about media psyop.
[02:25:15.977 --> 02:25:17.118]  It's about deception.
[02:25:17.558 --> 02:25:21.180]  We know the military and police are training to fight the American people.
[02:25:22.080 --> 02:25:23.482]  They admit it's their main mission.
[02:25:24.142 --> 02:25:24.963]  It's treasonous.
[02:25:25.503 --> 02:25:27.866]  We have good people in the government warning us about it.
[02:25:28.346 --> 02:25:34.272]  But they don't want to have a national debate about this, or the NSA spying, or the open borders, or Obamacare.
[02:25:34.632 --> 02:25:37.015]  They want to just stonewall us, but it's not working.
[02:25:37.655 --> 02:25:42.840]  And all the armored vehicles in the world aren't going to save the globalists when the economy collapses, Luke.
[02:25:43.281 --> 02:25:44.262]  What do you think's going on?
[02:25:46.084 --> 02:25:51.027]  I believe that is a 10-year Navy veteran, and I've been watching this come around for a while now.
[02:25:51.627 --> 02:26:02.233]  In our local area, we've been watching AH-64 Apache helicopters flying at 300 feet, SH-60 Navy equivalent to a Black Hawk flying, Black Hawk flying, B-2 Osprey.
[02:26:03.034 --> 02:26:08.477]  There's a ramp up of military activity that's beyond what is normal, and it has been normal since 10 years now.
[02:26:08.497 --> 02:26:10.118]  It's been escalating more and more.
[02:26:10.938 --> 02:26:14.200]  These exercises like Jade Helm and things, yeah, they're there too.
[02:26:15.000 --> 02:26:17.882]  You know, familiarize the, make the populace asleep.
[02:26:18.282 --> 02:26:19.363]  Make it seem like it's normal.
[02:26:19.523 --> 02:26:20.344]  And it's not normal.
[02:26:20.484 --> 02:26:21.264]  We shouldn't be here.
[02:26:21.325 --> 02:26:23.866]  This is against the Constitution, against coffee commentators.
[02:26:24.967 --> 02:26:29.470]  A lot of the veterans out here also believe, you know, we're not asleep, but we're waiting.
[02:26:29.630 --> 02:26:36.015]  It's getting to the point where it's becoming, you're watching a slow takeover, slow stripping of all of our rights.
[02:26:37.071 --> 02:26:44.858]  It's one of those deals that we're watching the MRACs coming in here to Southern Virginia and they're coming in and you know people don't want to talk about it and you try to wake some up.
[02:26:44.958 --> 02:26:47.561]  Some are awake to the paradigm and have that paradigm shift.
[02:26:48.282 --> 02:26:53.907]  Mostly are military or ex-military but the vast populace is still asleep at the wheel when it comes to this Alex.
[02:26:56.462 --> 02:27:00.425]  Well, that's why they say veterans are the number one enemy, because they know what's happening.
[02:27:00.445 --> 02:27:01.906]  They know how to read these manuals.
[02:27:01.946 --> 02:27:03.388]  They know the public's being lied to.
[02:27:04.048 --> 02:27:05.309]  But you're absolutely right.
[02:27:05.349 --> 02:27:14.296]  The escalation of training, the preparation, it's just... When I said a hundred times bigger than what it was 20 years ago, it is.
[02:27:15.317 --> 02:27:17.199]  I mean, 20 years ago it was very secretive.
[02:27:17.539 --> 02:27:21.162]  They would tell the public, no, you didn't see troops on the street, you didn't see black helicopters.
[02:27:21.722 --> 02:27:24.945]  They started it like that, very smartly, under Clinton.
[02:27:26.547 --> 02:27:28.829]  To then say kooks believe it even exists.
[02:27:28.869 --> 02:27:40.040]  So see, first, it was a litmus test to say there are no helicopters, there are no men scaling into the park in the middle of the night, there are no police checkpoints, not in America, there isn't any NSA spying.
[02:27:40.661 --> 02:27:43.744]  Crazy people that wear tinfoil hats say that.
[02:27:43.804 --> 02:27:45.385]  We'd be like, no, it's an irrational record.
[02:27:45.786 --> 02:27:46.646]  Shut up, schizophrenic.
[02:27:47.387 --> 02:27:52.789]  And then now, they just roll it all out and go, no, you're crazy if you think it's for you.
[02:27:53.229 --> 02:27:54.589]  And we're like, here's their manual.
[02:27:54.789 --> 02:27:57.010]  Here they are admitting it, scores of times.
[02:27:58.510 --> 02:27:59.711]  Why are you so racist?
[02:28:00.351 --> 02:28:09.054]  So, they're just building up, so when they launch it, you're gonna be a kook if you think gun confiscation is actually happening when it's happening.
[02:28:09.734 --> 02:28:10.654]  I mean, it's just amazing.
[02:28:11.815 --> 02:28:15.816]  There was denial, there was denial for weeks about the Katrina gun confiscation.
[02:28:15.836 --> 02:28:16.336]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:28:17.896 --> 02:28:25.205]  I was saying, you know, part of the problem is many of the veterans out here, and even active duty military, but Marines, maybe, they primarily know what's going on.
[02:28:25.245 --> 02:28:29.830]  A lot of them, I've talked to them off and they've been like, no, we're not going to go ahead and we're not going to follow this.
[02:28:30.571 --> 02:28:37.780]  So a lot of the military, they're not saying anything or when they're asked, like myself, I, you know, I was asked if I was, uh, had to take a,
[02:28:39.042 --> 02:28:39.422]  I don't
[02:28:59.404 --> 02:29:02.206]  Make the decision whether to stay inside or get out of the military.
[02:29:02.487 --> 02:29:07.311]  And it was one of those deals that a lot of us are stepping away from it because we see what's coming.
[02:29:07.411 --> 02:29:09.112]  And it is a tyranny, and it is here.
[02:29:09.132 --> 02:29:13.836]  When you have the Small Arms Disbandment Act already there, people pushing it.
[02:29:13.876 --> 02:29:15.057]  They're coming for the weapons.
[02:29:15.077 --> 02:29:16.558]  They're coming for America.
[02:29:16.578 --> 02:29:17.539]  They're coming for all of us.
[02:29:18.280 --> 02:29:20.962]  You don't think they're building FEMA camps, and they're not going to put us in them?
[02:29:21.002 --> 02:29:23.124]  They did it to people in World War II, the Japanese.
[02:29:23.164 --> 02:29:24.105]  We've already done it.
[02:29:24.345 --> 02:29:25.145]  America, wake up.
[02:29:25.866 --> 02:29:28.028]  You think just because we did it one time, we're not going to do it again?
[02:29:28.661 --> 02:29:31.183]  The system and everything is slowly coming unwound.
[02:29:31.323 --> 02:29:41.532]  I know the globalists are nervous about it, but I'm worried that they're going to do something like push ISIS into America, do false flag attacks, and then a snap exercise like Jay's home is going to go live.
[02:29:43.260 --> 02:29:44.761]  That is certainly what they're doing.
[02:29:44.861 --> 02:29:46.963]  And they can have this and have it go live.
[02:29:47.263 --> 02:29:48.704]  Then if they don't want to, they don't.
[02:29:48.804 --> 02:29:51.566]  But if we put pressure on it, they may back off.
[02:29:52.006 --> 02:29:55.089]  Then when we stop it going live, we get blamed for making it up.
[02:29:55.149 --> 02:29:55.389]  See?
[02:29:56.329 --> 02:29:57.951]  It's very sophisticated what they're doing.
[02:29:58.011 --> 02:29:58.711]  God bless you, Luke.
[02:29:58.731 --> 02:29:59.332]  Great caller.
[02:29:59.912 --> 02:30:00.813]  We're on the march.
[02:30:01.293 --> 02:30:02.894]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:30:03.815 --> 02:30:06.517]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:10.672 --> 02:30:13.195]  Let's talk about the real war on women.
[02:30:13.695 --> 02:30:16.158]  First wave feminism was a noble cause.
[02:30:16.538 --> 02:30:17.659]  But modern feminists?
[02:30:18.040 --> 02:30:18.200]  Ha!
[02:30:18.560 --> 02:30:26.489]  Well, instead of fighting for, say, paid and protected maternity leave, they want to ban words, shirts, and manspreading.
[02:30:26.949 --> 02:30:27.610]  Come on!
[02:30:27.950 --> 02:30:35.155]  That's cultural Marxism, which asserts that culture and language is responsible for oppressing women and not the state.
[02:30:35.475 --> 02:30:38.818]  The truth is, the state encourages gender wars.
[02:30:39.178 --> 02:30:43.181]  It's a divide-and-conquer tactic designed to keep us fighting amongst ourselves.
[02:30:43.561 --> 02:30:48.145]  In fact, the feminist movement was hijacked by the political class to exploit women.
[02:30:48.445 --> 02:30:52.448]  As the late Aaron Russo revealed, the Rockefellers bankrolled feminism
[02:30:52.928 --> 02:30:59.356]  Not because they had any interest in women's rights, but because women in the workforce was the ultimate trifecta.
[02:30:59.557 --> 02:31:06.726]  The state collects more tax dollars, children are indoctrinated at an earlier age, and the traditional family structure destroyed.
[02:31:07.106 --> 02:31:09.890]  Leanne McAdoo reporting for InfoWars.com
[02:31:10.489 --> 02:31:11.390]  Hey, how you doing, Al?
[02:31:11.450 --> 02:31:11.850]  Good, brother.
[02:31:12.010 --> 02:31:13.772]  Just recently started using your products.
[02:31:13.972 --> 02:31:15.513]  Everything you said about them is correct.
[02:31:15.673 --> 02:31:19.697]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them, and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[02:31:19.717 --> 02:31:22.299]  Well, thank you, brother, because it also funds our operation.
[02:31:22.339 --> 02:31:24.561]  But doing that, I know I've got to have the highest quality.

[02:31:40.737 --> 02:31:42.119]  Saving a ton of money there.
[02:31:42.399 --> 02:31:47.705]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs, harvested around the planet, and then concentrated
[02:31:47.705 --> 02:31:50.046]  Concentrated or maximum potency.
[02:31:50.246 --> 02:32:02.191]  They want to stun and dumb down and energy drinks and stuff just cover that up for a while But then burn you out in my experience where a stuff that gets your glands naturally going goes right to the source So it's pretty exciting and I love it.

[02:32:40.217 --> 02:32:40.858]  Alex Jones here.
[02:32:41.238 --> 02:32:50.324]  For the last two years, I've been working with top doctors, nutritionists, and chemists to design a nutraceutical formulation that has truly life-changing health benefits.
[02:32:50.524 --> 02:32:54.007]  Introducing the all-new Ancient Defense Herbal Immunity Blend.

[02:33:04.975 --> 02:33:06.015]  That's Infowarslife.com.
[02:33:18.709 --> 02:33:26.374]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:33:30.657 --> 02:33:33.318]  I need to not be lazy here.
[02:33:34.179 --> 02:33:38.682]  It's not laziness, it's actually painful, but we've got to get the wound lanced.
[02:33:39.462 --> 02:33:46.067]  Go over a bunch of the other headlines I haven't broken down yet today, but again, we're not just covering Jade Helm because...
[02:33:47.378 --> 02:34:08.300]  ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN, MSNBC, all the last few days have done pieces attacking Infowars.com, attacking yours truly Alex Jones, attacking Governor Greg Abbott, lying about us, saying that we say imminent martial law, that the military is going to come kill everybody.
[02:34:09.289 --> 02:34:14.954]  I mean, it's just beyond yellow journalism, but it's why the old-time newspapers are collapsing.
[02:34:15.334 --> 02:34:17.476]  It's why MSNBC and CNN are done.
[02:34:19.017 --> 02:34:21.779]  Because you are a bunch of arrogant narcissists.
[02:34:22.379 --> 02:34:35.650]  Notice how it's Cuomo's brother at CNN and just all these weird political people who want to be rock stars and show off to mommy at the carcass of the dinosaur media.
[02:34:38.390 --> 02:34:40.611]  Like ticks or something climbing around the dead body?
[02:34:41.271 --> 02:34:41.651]  Maggots?
[02:34:42.652 --> 02:34:46.433]  That carcass is only going to rot so long, so just keep discrediting yourselves.
[02:34:46.493 --> 02:34:48.074]  Everybody knows we're in a police state.
[02:34:48.674 --> 02:34:52.556]  Everybody knows Obama's announced executive taxation increases.
[02:34:52.596 --> 02:34:55.557]  Everybody knows Obamacare is a giant screw job.
[02:34:56.538 --> 02:34:57.138]  Everybody knows.
[02:34:59.659 --> 02:35:01.320]  And so, just keep attacking me.
[02:35:01.760 --> 02:35:02.440]  Just keep doing it.
[02:35:03.421 --> 02:35:03.961]  You're pathetic.
[02:35:06.297 --> 02:35:10.760]  And I read the comments, I even screenshotted some of them when I was looking online on my phone last night in bed.
[02:35:11.960 --> 02:35:14.182]  Some of these screenshots, and I'm going back to your calls and the other news.
[02:35:16.203 --> 02:35:17.243]  Go to my photos here.
[02:35:22.186 --> 02:35:24.768]  Kept intending to do this, but forgot.
[02:35:27.249 --> 02:35:27.950]  Oh, I messed up.
[02:35:28.030 --> 02:35:30.131]  I don't even know how to keep track of these cameras anymore.
[02:35:30.851 --> 02:35:32.152]  Here it is, here's some of the comments.
[02:35:32.432 --> 02:35:33.253]  Truly disgusting.
[02:35:40.970 --> 02:35:41.851]  Now I'm trying to find it.
[02:35:41.871 --> 02:35:43.312]  See, the show is completely unscripted.
[02:35:45.894 --> 02:35:46.975]  So I'm having trouble finding it.
[02:35:47.175 --> 02:35:48.416]  I didn't plan to even go to this.
[02:35:51.099 --> 02:35:55.162]  But there's comments that are like, the redneck, scum, filth, paranoid, crazy Texans.
[02:35:55.462 --> 02:35:56.563]  They're so insane.
[02:35:56.623 --> 02:35:58.325]  I'm ashamed to even live in this state.
[02:35:58.365 --> 02:35:59.326]  I want to get out of here.
[02:35:59.366 --> 02:36:02.148]  And the comments are like, yeah, I'm a Republican, but I don't like Abbott now.
[02:36:02.548 --> 02:36:04.090]  Obviously state's comments, most of them.
[02:36:05.345 --> 02:36:08.547]  Yeah, those evil Texans without a state income tax that everybody wants to move here.
[02:36:08.588 --> 02:36:08.688]  What?
[02:36:08.728 --> 02:36:09.648]  That's so stupid.
[02:36:10.029 --> 02:36:15.212]  Yeah, those dumb Texans that want to keep the Second Amendment and have a really low crime rate compared to other states.
[02:36:15.613 --> 02:36:16.493]  Man, they're bad.
[02:36:16.794 --> 02:36:18.155]  Yeah, those evil Texans.
[02:36:18.755 --> 02:36:18.995]  Why?
[02:36:19.035 --> 02:36:23.799]  They don't want to be part of the United Nations and they want to have America be energy independent.
[02:36:23.939 --> 02:36:25.780]  They're just horrible people.
[02:36:26.101 --> 02:36:29.283]  That's why everybody all over the world says Texans are so polite and so nice.
[02:36:29.904 --> 02:36:31.845]  Except some people moved here who aren't Texans.
[02:36:31.865 --> 02:36:32.866]  We're not even Texas anymore.
[02:36:34.689 --> 02:36:36.951]  Oh, this is shameful!
[02:36:37.472 --> 02:36:47.940]  How horrible that out of the whole country being overrun by military training and checkpoints and unconstitutional garbage, how dare Texas when Obama opened all the borders?
[02:36:48.962 --> 02:36:53.406]  The new governor did what he could to seal the border and put state police down there to stop felons.
[02:36:54.007 --> 02:36:58.211]  I mean, imagine that he would do such a thing!
[02:36:58.671 --> 02:37:07.360]  And that when they shut down the power plants, almost doubling Texas power prices, he filed lawsuits and injunctions to turn some of the plants back on.
[02:37:07.860 --> 02:37:08.781]  Man, that's bad!
[02:37:08.841 --> 02:37:10.823]  Those filthy redneck scum!
[02:37:11.784 --> 02:37:17.589]  We're the fastest growing state in the country and the most jobs and some low taxes?
[02:37:18.410 --> 02:37:20.151]  Man, those Texans are bad!
[02:37:20.751 --> 02:37:22.313]  Well, I heard they've got hospitality.
[02:37:22.333 --> 02:37:24.314]  I heard they're polite and open doors for ladies.
[02:37:24.575 --> 02:37:27.177]  There's nothing worse than those people!
[02:37:27.717 --> 02:37:28.718]  Everybody knows it.
[02:37:29.999 --> 02:37:30.900]  What a bunch of traitors.
[02:37:33.220 --> 02:37:35.161]  But again, they just think ridiculing people.
[02:37:35.821 --> 02:37:36.681]  Ah, look at you!
[02:37:36.701 --> 02:37:39.882]  I want to do a piece where I go back and find all the news articles.
[02:37:40.322 --> 02:37:41.542]  We've got some hanging up around here.
[02:37:41.562 --> 02:37:45.963]  And we're like, crazy people think there's secret military drills in helicopters!
[02:37:47.104 --> 02:37:48.784]  Crazy people think there's military drills!
[02:37:49.224 --> 02:37:50.264]  What'd you see, crazy?
[02:37:50.524 --> 02:37:53.845]  Well, the troops came out of the sky and blew up that building, and the building's burned down.
[02:37:53.865 --> 02:37:55.246]  They're like, you really think you saw that?
[02:37:55.786 --> 02:37:59.987]  I had the Daily Show back when it first started in the late 90s attacking me.
[02:38:01.428 --> 02:38:04.410]  Comedy Central would like, have shows.
[02:38:04.510 --> 02:38:05.871]  I think it was that show, yeah.
[02:38:05.891 --> 02:38:14.697]  I mean, they would attack me a bunch, I just can't remember all the times, and they'd be like, ha ha ha ha ha ha, he claims there's military drills, I got another one I'm gonna tell ya.
[02:38:18.219 --> 02:38:21.502]  And then now it's like, ha ha, he doesn't like the military drills, ha ha ha.
[02:38:22.850 --> 02:38:26.472]  See, we told you it was going on, so you denied it.
[02:38:27.073 --> 02:38:31.996]  And now that it's all admitted, you go, oh, we say it's permanent martial law.
[02:38:32.256 --> 02:38:35.178]  They're coming to put us in FEMA camps and kill us and take our guns this summer.
[02:38:35.818 --> 02:38:41.862]  And I didn't say that, though you'll probably take that clip out of context and play it on the news saying I just said that.
[02:38:42.222 --> 02:38:43.763]  I said that's not what I'm saying.
[02:38:44.124 --> 02:38:46.005]  I said that's where it leads, though.
[02:38:48.288 --> 02:38:52.611]  Because the globalists don't ever want to stand up, fight politically, or economically, or physically.
[02:38:52.951 --> 02:39:03.639]  They want to take over with martial law, start disappearing citizens as they're already doing, confiscating guns of veterans all over the country and other groups, and just ease us into the cook pot.
[02:39:05.059 --> 02:39:12.244]  Kind of like Bugs Bunny sitting there while the pygmies are going around him, and they're cutting up stuff, putting it in the big bowl, and he goes, oh, thank you for the bath, mister.
[02:39:12.304 --> 02:39:15.767]  I can't do a very good Bugs Bunny imitation of that Brooklyn accent.
[02:39:17.588 --> 02:39:19.629]  He goes, my, it's getting a little hot in here.
[02:39:19.689 --> 02:39:26.733]  Then they slap on the top of the... ...of the cauldron.
[02:39:30.635 --> 02:39:33.177]  And they're just putting us in the cauldron, they're chopping up the carrots.
[02:39:34.297 --> 02:39:36.819]  We have their recipe, you look over and read the recipe.
[02:39:37.099 --> 02:39:38.820]  It's for rabbit, it's for patriot.
[02:39:41.662 --> 02:39:43.262]  And I say, can I see that cookbook please?
[02:39:43.603 --> 02:39:45.444]  And the whole cookbook's for patriots.
[02:39:46.209 --> 02:39:47.089]  Patriots are the enemy!
[02:39:47.129 --> 02:39:47.629]  Gun owners!
[02:39:47.649 --> 02:39:48.010]  Christians!
[02:39:48.030 --> 02:39:48.990]  How are you going to round them up?
[02:39:49.030 --> 02:39:49.850]  The internment camps!
[02:39:50.110 --> 02:39:51.591]  How to process social security numbers!
[02:39:51.971 --> 02:39:52.991]  All this is on army.mil!
[02:39:53.031 --> 02:39:54.732]  How you're going to take our guns!
[02:39:54.772 --> 02:39:56.012]  How the preachers work for you!
[02:39:56.232 --> 02:39:56.912]  The Infra Guard!
[02:39:56.952 --> 02:39:57.873]  The Citizen Spies!
[02:39:58.353 --> 02:39:59.333]  You go talk to the cops!
[02:39:59.373 --> 02:40:01.314]  Yeah, we're trying to take on gun owners and veterans!
[02:40:01.574 --> 02:40:02.754]  We're about to have a war with them!
[02:40:02.774 --> 02:40:05.155]  Just... You're reading a whole cookbook on Patriots!
[02:40:05.435 --> 02:40:06.736]  And we're already in the cook pot!
[02:40:06.936 --> 02:40:08.556]  With carrots and potatoes floating around!
[02:40:08.816 --> 02:40:09.597]  Our butts burning!
[02:40:09.617 --> 02:40:12.437]  And you're going... Let me just put some handcuffs on ya!
[02:40:12.718 --> 02:40:13.878]  And put this lid on!
[02:40:14.378 --> 02:40:15.438]  We're like, you know what?
[02:40:16.259 --> 02:40:19.799]  I don't want to be rude for dinner, but I'm gonna get out of the pot.
[02:40:21.180 --> 02:40:22.960]  They're like, shut up terrorist, stay in the pot.
[02:40:23.460 --> 02:40:25.841]  No, I'm gonna get my leg out of here, I just, I told you.
[02:40:26.141 --> 02:40:28.102]  They're like, shut up racist, don't get out of the pot!
[02:40:28.642 --> 02:40:31.622]  But they don't want to use force yet, because then they gotta admit they're trying to eat us.
[02:40:31.642 --> 02:40:40.085]  So they're like, I told you to get back in there, I'm gonna call you a sexist, homophobe, a racist, a redneck, get back in the pot!
[02:40:40.385 --> 02:40:41.085]  Get back in the pot!
[02:40:42.079 --> 02:40:51.205]  Just six months ago, I'd say, there's a war by the Saudis to drive down oil prices, to bankrupt Texas oil production, and when they're done with that, they're gonna jack the price up to highest levels.
[02:40:51.485 --> 02:40:53.226]  Oh, shut up, conspiracy theorists!
[02:40:53.426 --> 02:40:56.048]  They had news articles, now he claims a Saudi conspiracy.
[02:40:56.368 --> 02:41:05.214]  Because a lot of this media works for those guys, you know, like they got thousands of princes worth billions apiece, so one prince is worth like 200 billion dollars or something, you know.
[02:41:08.136 --> 02:41:09.217]  And so that's who they work for.
[02:41:10.492 --> 02:41:13.541]  And of course now it's totally admitted the Saudis admit they did it to bankrupt us.
[02:41:14.002 --> 02:41:14.724]  Our allies.
[02:41:16.181 --> 02:41:18.362]  This is the sick games they play all day.
[02:41:19.022 --> 02:41:21.723]  I'm getting out of the pot.
[02:41:22.243 --> 02:41:22.783]  I'm done.
[02:41:23.144 --> 02:41:25.064]  I don't believe a word comes out of the New World Order.
[02:41:25.324 --> 02:41:26.285]  I don't trust anything they say.
[02:41:26.545 --> 02:41:29.346]  And it's so healthy that people don't trust the feds.
[02:41:29.646 --> 02:41:32.607]  It's so healthy they know they've taken the military over.
[02:41:32.847 --> 02:41:35.508]  It's so healthy people don't believe a word out of their mouth.
[02:41:35.768 --> 02:41:39.090]  It's so healthy people are jumping at shadows and the Walmart stuff.
[02:41:39.290 --> 02:41:44.872]  Because even if that's not what's happening there, overall it is happening and people are getting wise.
[02:41:45.692 --> 02:41:47.753]  And not being a bunch of trusting idiots.
[02:41:48.174 --> 02:41:50.195]  Wild in Wisconsin!
[02:41:51.016 --> 02:41:52.617]  Go ahead, you're on the air worldwide.
[02:41:52.637 --> 02:41:53.157]  Thanks for holding.
[02:41:54.458 --> 02:41:55.138]  What's up, Doc?
[02:41:56.399 --> 02:42:01.082]  You know how the elite globalist likes numerology and naming things?
[02:42:01.362 --> 02:42:13.190]  With Jade Helm, I was looking into it, and with Jade, there is an interesting Chinese saying, which is, the jade maker does not leave his mark.
[02:42:17.694 --> 02:42:18.975]  Very interesting.
[02:42:19.075 --> 02:42:25.719]  The military's big on acronyms, and if you spell out Jade and Helm, it's all sorts of, you know, cryptic things.
[02:42:26.980 --> 02:42:28.060]  It goes from bad to worse.
[02:42:28.180 --> 02:42:33.904]  I'm still going to look in at the end of the show to Memorandum 7277 and Public Law 109.
[02:42:34.804 --> 02:42:43.790]  I can't remember from memory, but I believe one of the drills back then was called Jade Helm, carried out on how to suppress, I think it was a city in Georgia.
[02:42:46.454 --> 02:42:50.157]  So, that's why people are so freaked out.
[02:42:51.158 --> 02:42:58.063]  But they call it joint assistance for development and execution along the homeland eradication of local militias.
[02:42:59.544 --> 02:43:02.347]  That's what people are saying Jane Helm stands for.
[02:43:03.227 --> 02:43:12.575]  All I know is everything in the Army manuals is now directly written by the Southern Poverty Law Center and the ADL, two purely anti-freedom organizations.
[02:43:16.141 --> 02:43:17.202]  What do you think it is, sir?
[02:43:19.904 --> 02:43:20.965]  Uh, just like you said.
[02:43:23.927 --> 02:43:27.790]  Well, give me further, uh, breakdown, because I've been ranting here and I need to cool down.
[02:43:28.310 --> 02:43:30.352]  What do you think, overall, the PSYOP they're running?
[02:43:32.633 --> 02:43:45.403]  I think when you get to the, uh, when you're jackhammering the bedrock of the rabbit hole, um, yes, it is Satanism, but, um, humanity as a whole
[02:43:46.799 --> 02:43:53.501]  As a creature has unfortunate fondness for the gritty and the darkness.
[02:43:53.541 --> 02:43:54.162]  It's part of it.
[02:43:55.362 --> 02:44:00.984]  And it's the price that is included with the deal we're given in this reality.
[02:44:02.764 --> 02:44:03.745]  Wow, that's really deep.
[02:44:06.726 --> 02:44:07.186]  You're right.
[02:44:07.206 --> 02:44:08.826]  And then we deny that we're evil.
[02:44:09.287 --> 02:44:09.947]  Part of us is.
[02:44:10.007 --> 02:44:11.667]  We deny our human animalness.
[02:44:11.967 --> 02:44:13.388]  We deny our darker selves.
[02:44:15.478 --> 02:44:16.219]  And we're blind.
[02:44:16.259 --> 02:44:23.284]  I mean, I love how the media tries to deny the dark side of government and the dark side of power when it's been known throughout history.
[02:44:24.565 --> 02:44:26.827]  We've been denying our own dark side.
[02:44:26.887 --> 02:44:27.947]  That's why it's taken over.
[02:44:28.128 --> 02:44:30.870]  The devil's greatest trick was convincing the world he didn't exist.
[02:44:33.892 --> 02:44:44.180]  Yes, and you know, even with how we were saying before, the sayings and how things are named, we've named a thousand things.
[02:44:45.117 --> 02:44:54.544]  And calling it light and dark kind of attaches a predisposition of meaning where... Exactly!
[02:44:54.584 --> 02:44:59.827]  If something's light, then it must be good, but the Bible says Satan comes masquerading as an angel of light.
[02:44:59.907 --> 02:45:00.307]  Exactly.
[02:45:00.488 --> 02:45:02.389]  I'm sorry, I don't know where you were going, but I threw that in.
[02:45:02.429 --> 02:45:02.709]  Go ahead.
[02:45:03.730 --> 02:45:04.110]  Go ahead.
[02:45:04.831 --> 02:45:14.157]  Well, what I was going at is that I think, and you're a strong proponent of this, and some people call it the fifth element or quintessence or whatever,
[02:45:14.850 --> 02:45:22.156]  But we have to rely on our gut and our feelings because that transcends all the worldly Bravo Sierra.
[02:45:23.637 --> 02:45:24.037]  That's right.
[02:45:24.097 --> 02:45:29.221]  The gut ties into the soul and it'll tell you 100% right every time, but we don't want to follow it.
[02:45:29.581 --> 02:45:30.642]  But it's almost like you have two guts.
[02:45:30.702 --> 02:45:32.504]  It's like the angel and the devil on your shoulder.
[02:45:32.884 --> 02:45:35.286]  You've got the gut you knows good and cares about you.
[02:45:35.306 --> 02:45:36.206]  That's always right.
[02:45:36.527 --> 02:45:38.688]  But then there's that other thing where it's like, don't listen to that.
[02:45:38.768 --> 02:45:39.229]  Don't listen.
[02:45:39.269 --> 02:45:39.729]  No, no, no.
[02:45:40.370 --> 02:45:43.092]  And he gives you all these excuses, but you still know what's right.
[02:45:43.412 --> 02:45:44.493]  What do you call that other thing?
[02:45:45.825 --> 02:45:48.387]  I would say intelligence and heart.
[02:45:49.207 --> 02:45:55.832]  The intelligence is giving you the reason and the logic, while the heart's trying to ground you more to the spirituality.
[02:45:57.893 --> 02:45:59.954]  But once again, these are all just words, you know.
[02:45:59.994 --> 02:46:01.916]  They really, at the end of the day, mean nothing.
[02:46:02.516 --> 02:46:08.760]  What matters more is the life, the living, what we are doing here.
[02:46:09.501 --> 02:46:14.584]  And just from my point of view, and I'm nobody, a white nobody.
[02:46:15.510 --> 02:46:33.835]  And from my point of view, it looks like if these globalists are so elitist, moneymakers, putting money on the pedestal and success as their paragon or their golden idol, it seems to me that this system they built is very, very counterproductive to profit.
[02:46:35.336 --> 02:46:43.160]  Well, a very high level of it is about money and temporal power and status, but not the very top levels of the pyramid.
[02:46:43.200 --> 02:46:45.682]  It's all about raw power over humanity playing God.
[02:46:46.102 --> 02:46:48.623]  And that's why it's so destructive and it's counterproductive.
[02:46:48.924 --> 02:46:53.206]  They get people to sell out believing it's for prosperity, and it's a fraud in the end.
[02:46:53.246 --> 02:46:54.467]  God bless you, appreciate your point.
[02:46:55.627 --> 02:46:58.109]  Really good points from Wild in Wisconsin.
[02:47:00.130 --> 02:47:04.132]  I'm going to go to Adam and Mary and Dean and Daryl here in a moment.
[02:47:08.939 --> 02:47:10.960]  These are the times that try people's souls.
[02:47:13.240 --> 02:47:18.782]  And the organized criminal takeover we're witnessing, that's accelerating, gets me hyped up.
[02:47:18.802 --> 02:47:23.303]  I mean, as I've said a thousand times, or more, that's a normal animal response.
[02:47:23.763 --> 02:47:25.924]  And we're not animals, but we're in animals' bodies.
[02:47:25.964 --> 02:47:29.765]  I mean, we have our animal side, but we are men, we are women, we are humans.
[02:47:32.686 --> 02:47:37.547]  But just my, even my bestial side wants to fight this tyranny.
[02:47:38.427 --> 02:47:40.228]  I mean, it recognizes it as death.
[02:47:41.408 --> 02:47:42.868]  And we are amongst the living now.
[02:47:44.109 --> 02:47:45.209]  I am not afraid of death.
[02:47:45.669 --> 02:47:53.511]  I've seen so many family members and friends and people die, the more of them die, there's almost this weird thought of nostalgia, someday I'll be with them.
[02:47:54.351 --> 02:47:56.512]  There's almost a thought of peace in death.
[02:48:00.213 --> 02:48:07.035]  But I fear becoming weak, becoming old, and dying, because then I can't defend my family, my friends, and others.
[02:48:11.607 --> 02:48:13.007]  I want to be strong for the tribe.
[02:48:13.047 --> 02:48:14.248]  I want to be strong for humanity.
[02:48:14.328 --> 02:48:20.270]  I want to create things and ideas that fight the fraud to make our people stronger.
[02:48:20.450 --> 02:48:22.170]  All of our people to go forward together.
[02:48:24.211 --> 02:48:26.351]  And I try to be a good person and it's hard.
[02:48:26.411 --> 02:48:31.293]  I can't imagine turning myself over to evil and using all the knowledge I have against people.
[02:48:32.421 --> 02:48:38.105]  I mean, just the thought of it makes me want to overturn this desk and start just breaking things.
[02:48:38.225 --> 02:48:45.749]  I mean, I just... The fundamental bad will of wanting to screw people over makes me viciously angry at the control freaks.
[02:48:45.790 --> 02:48:46.610]  I'm sick of them!
[02:48:46.810 --> 02:48:47.531]  I know their tricks!
[02:48:47.751 --> 02:48:49.092]  I know every stinking thing about them!
[02:48:49.112 --> 02:48:51.073]  I want to get my hands around their throats!
[02:48:51.693 --> 02:48:53.715]  Let's go ahead and talk to Adam in Canada.
[02:48:53.735 --> 02:48:54.375]  You're on the air.
[02:48:54.395 --> 02:48:59.298]  Hi, Alex.
[02:48:59.658 --> 02:49:00.219]  Welcome, brother.
[02:49:01.553 --> 02:49:03.035]  Thank you for taking my call today.
[02:49:03.135 --> 02:49:08.681]  It's awfully brave of you to be able to take live dissenting calls on the air.
[02:49:08.741 --> 02:49:10.744]  I don't even know that you... I see it says disagree.
[02:49:10.784 --> 02:49:12.305]  I don't even read what's under it most of the time.
[02:49:12.325 --> 02:49:13.186]  No, that's fine.
[02:49:13.327 --> 02:49:14.128]  Just go ahead, brother.
[02:49:15.595 --> 02:49:17.176]  Well, you know, it's funny.
[02:49:17.936 --> 02:49:23.860]  You know, I agree with 99% of what you say, 99% of the time.
[02:49:24.701 --> 02:49:26.282]  You are very prophetic.
[02:49:27.182 --> 02:49:28.823]  You've always been ahead of the curve.
[02:49:29.684 --> 02:49:37.589]  And it's simply because you're willing to accept, you know, the signs and the symbols that are placed right in front of you.
[02:49:37.609 --> 02:49:38.849]  Yeah, it's not hard, exactly.
[02:49:39.130 --> 02:49:39.610]  It's a joke.
[02:49:39.650 --> 02:49:40.110]  It's a joke.
[02:49:40.170 --> 02:49:41.071]  I've done nothing special.
[02:49:43.127 --> 02:49:43.588]  Exactly.
[02:49:43.628 --> 02:49:53.813]  I mean, these people do have a bizarre sense of honor in that they insist on telling you what they're going to do right before they do it.
[02:49:55.074 --> 02:49:56.374]  Well, that's a metaphysical rule.
[02:49:56.394 --> 02:49:57.715]  The vampire has to get permission.
[02:49:57.735 --> 02:49:59.156]  I don't know why they do it, but they have to.
[02:49:59.196 --> 02:50:01.477]  But listen, get to what you disagree on.
[02:50:01.497 --> 02:50:01.797]  Go ahead.
[02:50:02.958 --> 02:50:08.220]  Okay, so my disagreement is on the basic premise that it's wrong.
[02:50:09.501 --> 02:50:11.262]  Look, these people have
[02:50:11.935 --> 02:50:14.290]  Have planned this throughout.
[02:50:15.326 --> 02:50:17.467]  It's multi-generational, this plan.
[02:50:19.028 --> 02:50:27.213]  They've got a plan for humanity that ends up with us in this Star Trek-style utopia.
[02:50:28.033 --> 02:50:32.475]  Unfortunately, we have to go through some growing pains before we get there.
[02:50:32.495 --> 02:50:34.396]  I'm going to put you on hold.
[02:50:34.737 --> 02:50:35.677]  I'm going to come back to you.
[02:50:35.737 --> 02:50:38.779]  I'm going to do overdrive so that we have time to talk today.
[02:50:38.799 --> 02:50:42.261]  And I'll get to Mary and Dean, everybody, and Daryl.
[02:50:43.321 --> 02:50:51.086]  People know that in the job I'm in, if I break confidence with people, you see former NSA directors of intelligence, you see movie stars here.
[02:50:51.106 --> 02:50:53.548]  I mean, I don't break confidence, that's why I can get these big guests.
[02:50:54.588 --> 02:50:59.972]  I have met with globalists, pretty high level, and top people, and they give me the exact same speech.
[02:51:00.152 --> 02:51:02.333]  Alex, we're in control for a reason.
[02:51:03.294 --> 02:51:06.176]  And the fact you even know how we operate shows you should be one of us.
[02:51:06.616 --> 02:51:07.717]  I've been given the same speech.
[02:51:08.317 --> 02:51:09.438]  And we're gonna break it down when we come back.
[02:51:10.578 --> 02:51:12.999]  Hunters, anglers, campers and survivalists.
[02:51:13.199 --> 02:51:14.140]  Get back to nature.

[02:51:40.111 --> 02:51:49.359]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[02:51:49.419 --> 02:51:50.139]  This capitalism?
[02:51:50.199 --> 02:51:56.324]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[02:51:56.364 --> 02:52:00.007]  Ted Anderson, I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.

[02:53:39.215 --> 02:53:41.797]  My name is Del and I live in El Cajon, California.
[02:53:42.097 --> 02:53:50.502]  I was concerned about my cholesterol readings because I knew that high cholesterol is related to clogging of the arteries and increases the risk for heart attack and stroke.
[02:53:50.982 --> 02:53:56.605]  One day, I heard an ad for Heart and Body Extract and I was skeptical, but I decided to give it a try.
[02:53:57.166 --> 02:53:58.767]  Man, the numbers don't lie.

[02:54:13.812 --> 02:54:21.358]  There must be some kind of way out of here, said the Joker to the thief.
[02:54:21.438 --> 02:54:23.239]  There's too much confusion.
[02:54:23.299 --> 02:54:24.300]  I can't get no relief.
[02:54:24.340 --> 02:54:27.062]  I've said many times it's hard to turn songs like this off.
[02:54:27.102 --> 02:54:28.844]  It's my favorite Jimi Hendrix song.
[02:54:29.244 --> 02:54:35.629]  There must be some kind of way out of here, said the Joker to the thief.
[02:54:36.289 --> 02:54:38.511]  There's too much confusion.
[02:54:40.332 --> 02:54:45.755]  You know, I said I could use to work 18 hours a day, probably 3 or 4 days a week.
[02:54:45.795 --> 02:54:48.557]  I've worked that many hours, 15, 18 hours a day.
[02:54:48.617 --> 02:54:51.179]  Now I can only do about 10, sometimes I do coast to coast, maybe 14 hours a day.
[02:54:51.199 --> 02:54:52.780]  It's not the physical act, it's that
[02:55:04.146 --> 02:55:10.454]  I've got to go skeet shooting once every few weeks or fishing or hiking every few days.
[02:55:10.494 --> 02:55:14.279]  I got to do something to just try to get my mind off this stuff.
[02:55:15.140 --> 02:55:18.124]  And I can't go see movies because that'll be full of propaganda.
[02:55:18.144 --> 02:55:23.110]  I mean it's just it's just crazy but I've got to punch into the matrix to fight it.
[02:55:25.029 --> 02:55:28.930]  But realize, the globalists are just a bunch of pathetic crooks trying to take control of reality.
[02:55:28.950 --> 02:55:29.770]  They will fail.
[02:55:30.190 --> 02:55:31.650]  The question is, how rough will it be?
[02:55:32.030 --> 02:55:38.092]  This caller, I'm going to go right back to, and then to other callers, Mary and others, Adam, is saying what I always hear.
[02:55:40.012 --> 02:55:42.912]  Hey, listen, the elite took over because they are the elite.
[02:55:42.932 --> 02:55:44.853]  It's survival of the fittest, social Darwinism.
[02:55:45.193 --> 02:55:48.914]  The fact that you're into this shows that you're one of us, a classic thing.
[02:55:48.974 --> 02:55:50.214]  Join us, you're part of the elite.
[02:55:51.783 --> 02:55:54.645]  That's what they told my dad in college because he was like top of his class.
[02:55:55.506 --> 02:55:56.207]  Same stuff.
[02:55:56.307 --> 02:55:59.109]  Eugenics, world government, I mean this has been going on a long time.
[02:55:59.489 --> 02:56:01.231]  And they just go after anybody sticks their head up.
[02:56:01.571 --> 02:56:04.473]  And then most people join to be part of the elite and don't even become elite.
[02:56:05.974 --> 02:56:06.695]  And then what's elite?
[02:56:06.715 --> 02:56:08.056]  You fly around in a helicopter?
[02:56:09.357 --> 02:56:10.118]  Eat the best food?
[02:56:10.198 --> 02:56:13.240]  I mean, you know, there's nothing to sell out to.
[02:56:15.002 --> 02:56:16.603]  There's nothing to sell out to, folks.
[02:56:18.925 --> 02:56:21.127]  I was happier when I didn't have pretty much anything.
[02:56:22.005 --> 02:56:27.167]  Okay, well, if you really want to get to the heart of where I disagree,
[02:56:40.081 --> 02:56:46.606]  Your premise is that it's rich people manipulating the world market and the world economy.
[02:56:46.626 --> 02:56:55.192]  No, it is ultra-rich crony capitalists waging war on rich people, nouveau riche, middle class and working class, and then the giant domesticated slob class.
[02:56:56.621 --> 02:56:57.182]  Exactly.
[02:56:57.542 --> 02:56:57.763]  Right?
[02:56:58.303 --> 02:57:01.987]  And your classifications are based on income.
[02:57:02.127 --> 02:57:03.968]  Based on, you know, what you're worth.
[02:57:04.469 --> 02:57:06.371]  And I don't think that's really the case.
[02:57:06.831 --> 02:57:11.756]  Honestly, I think that... No, there have been a lot of dead poets that died poor that I think had beautiful minds.
[02:57:12.116 --> 02:57:14.939]  Or Vincent van Gogh, I think was a great painter and only sold one painting.
[02:57:15.539 --> 02:57:16.741]  I mean, I get what you're saying.
[02:57:17.021 --> 02:57:19.723]  You're projecting onto me that I quantify everything by wealth.
[02:57:20.064 --> 02:57:24.748]  I quantify by wealth only at the level of voting rights in the global corporation.
[02:57:25.009 --> 02:57:30.654]  That's why they want to take money away from us, because we might discover the power of using it in their paradigm to defeat them.
[02:57:32.015 --> 02:57:33.257]  No, no, no, Alex.
[02:57:33.297 --> 02:57:34.438]  That's not what I'm saying.
[02:57:34.578 --> 02:57:35.038]  Not at all.
[02:57:36.848 --> 02:57:44.611]  In the beginning, it was the wealthy plutocrats, the rich aristocracy from old Europe that was in control.
[02:57:45.031 --> 02:57:48.452]  Now, I believe that it's the smart people.
[02:57:48.793 --> 02:57:49.613]  It's the egghead.
[02:57:50.593 --> 02:57:54.455]  The rich people, they knew they weren't smart enough to pull this off on their own.
[02:57:54.575 --> 02:57:55.515]  Oh no, I agree.
[02:57:55.855 --> 02:57:57.556]  The technocrats have taken over.
[02:57:57.796 --> 02:57:59.656]  The robber barons hired a bunch of scientists.
[02:57:59.977 --> 02:58:00.957]  They've now taken over.
[02:58:02.367 --> 02:58:03.227]  Exactly.
[02:58:03.527 --> 02:58:09.548]  So it's not the rich people trying to get rid of the poor people, it's the smart people trying to get rid of the dumb people.
[02:58:09.568 --> 02:58:12.089]  Yeah, well let me tell you something.
[02:58:12.109 --> 02:58:23.031]  A, that's immoral, that's using the Ring of Mordor, and they're targeting everyone with fluoride, they're targeting everyone with GMO, and the argument is, well, the word gets out to smart people not to eat it.
[02:58:23.551 --> 02:58:25.592]  Okay, well what are the aluminum dioxide being sprayed?
[02:58:25.652 --> 02:58:27.132]  No, they like to kill people.
[02:58:28.052 --> 02:58:31.804]  The argument is, what they are is super smart people that are also sadists.
[02:58:33.713 --> 02:58:34.593]  You're absolutely correct.
[02:58:34.853 --> 02:58:37.234]  And it's not that... And I'm gonna get my hands around their neck.
[02:58:37.994 --> 02:58:41.575]  They just have a self-preservation instinct, right?
[02:58:41.795 --> 02:58:42.795]  No, no, no.
[02:58:42.815 --> 02:58:47.016]  You build up humanity, and then if a horde of dumbasses try to kill you, you take them out.
[02:58:47.276 --> 02:58:48.557]  But you don't play dirty.
[02:58:48.977 --> 02:58:51.597]  And it's evil, and what you just articulated is their master plan.
[02:58:51.617 --> 02:58:52.638]  I'm gonna come back.

[02:58:57.019 --> 02:58:58.259]  I need the funding.
[02:59:01.511 --> 02:59:02.551]  In the near future.
[02:59:02.851 --> 02:59:06.973]  When you realize how fake it all is, the football, the basketball.
[02:59:07.333 --> 02:59:08.353]  Security alert.
[02:59:08.573 --> 02:59:10.314]  This is Homeland Security.
[02:59:10.574 --> 02:59:11.194]  Analysis.
[02:59:11.454 --> 02:59:12.094]  InfoWars.
[02:59:12.174 --> 02:59:14.135]  Building independent media operations.
[02:59:14.155 --> 02:59:19.116]  You let the worst people get controlled and tell us that we are the ones responsible.
[02:59:19.156 --> 02:59:20.096]  Prime Directive.
[02:59:20.196 --> 02:59:21.637]  Discredit Alex Jones.
[02:59:21.737 --> 02:59:24.517]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[02:59:24.577 --> 02:59:27.658]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called InfoWars.
[02:59:27.818 --> 02:59:29.999]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[02:59:30.199 --> 02:59:31.620]  These people are assaulting us.
[02:59:31.660 --> 02:59:33.980]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[02:59:34.481 --> 02:59:36.141]  They are never going to stop.
[02:59:36.441 --> 02:59:40.323]  They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.

[02:59:47.426 --> 02:59:48.166]  Imperative.
[02:59:48.426 --> 02:59:50.407]  Deploy Rhythm Planet TV.
[02:59:50.447 --> 02:59:54.869]  You gotta set your eye on the enemy, not worry about what propaganda they put out.
[02:59:55.129 --> 02:59:56.489]  Intellectually, it's begun.
[02:59:56.509 --> 02:59:57.270]  You can feel it.
[03:00:02.975 --> 03:00:07.660]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:13.225 --> 03:00:19.251]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:00:19.851 --> 03:00:22.874]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:23.295 --> 03:00:25.116]  Tomorrow, if I get reminded to do it,
[03:00:26.275 --> 03:00:28.136]  I'm going to talk more about that last caller.
[03:00:28.156 --> 03:00:29.957]  He can call back in sometime if he can get through.
[03:00:30.817 --> 03:00:31.938]  That's the whole mindset.
[03:00:31.978 --> 03:00:35.099]  We're putting fluoride into brain damaged people because they're dumb and they deserve it.
[03:00:35.960 --> 03:00:40.562]  We're teaching them 2 plus 2 equals 10 or 5 or 8 to screw them up because we're the smart people.
[03:00:40.582 --> 03:00:43.584]  It's like, I'm a 41-year-old man.
[03:00:43.664 --> 03:00:47.526]  I could hypothetically trick a 2-year-old toddler to jump off a cliff.
[03:00:47.566 --> 03:00:48.146]  I'm smart.
[03:00:49.287 --> 03:00:52.228]  How we treat the least of us, we treat the greatest of us.
[03:00:52.968 --> 03:00:53.449]  And I just...
[03:00:55.287 --> 03:00:56.027]  I won't be part of it.
[03:00:56.527 --> 03:01:18.874]  But see, notice the social engineers get good moral people to give all our rights up and our money up and take care of the big masses of people in the name of being nice while they're busy sawing their legs off and giving them crutches and then breeding a giant horde so that finally the small group left that's working will join the globalists and exterminate the mass and then we'll all live happily ever after.
[03:01:19.054 --> 03:01:19.835]  That's not going to happen.
[03:01:20.975 --> 03:01:22.035]  And that's how they've solved the agenda.
[03:01:22.055 --> 03:01:23.596]  It's just like they tell the general public
[03:01:25.049 --> 03:01:26.631]  We're going to reduce world population by half.
[03:01:26.971 --> 03:01:28.693]  And then more internal documents, 80%.
[03:01:28.753 --> 03:01:29.173]  Higher level, 90%.
[03:01:29.213 --> 03:01:34.578]  Then you get up to the very highest level of PhDs and it's like, the human is a disease itself.
[03:01:34.618 --> 03:01:40.204]  We will merge into the new super sapien technocrat with the machines and become gods.
[03:01:40.464 --> 03:01:45.229]  There will be a final battle between our intellects to decide who will become the new god of the universe.
[03:01:45.289 --> 03:01:48.152]  I mean, it's just delusional crazy town.
[03:01:49.164 --> 03:01:50.184]  And it's not going to happen.
[03:01:50.565 --> 03:01:53.266]  None of you will inherit the world or the universe.
[03:01:54.026 --> 03:01:55.246]  You're complete jokes.
[03:01:56.767 --> 03:02:00.789]  Humanity and creation is like a compound eye, to quote my dad.
[03:02:00.809 --> 03:02:06.431]  And that's how the universe, God, experiences this level of consciousness.
[03:02:08.012 --> 03:02:10.333]  We're not God, but we're made in the image.
[03:02:11.893 --> 03:02:13.774]  We are God experiencing the universe.
[03:02:14.154 --> 03:02:18.676]  Christ came down, the one, the only, to ask God to be a man.
[03:02:21.886 --> 03:02:24.250]  Pretty heavy, even if it's fiction, which I don't think it is.
[03:02:24.931 --> 03:02:27.675]  Let's go ahead and talk to Mary in California.
[03:02:27.715 --> 03:02:28.356]  You're on the air.
[03:02:28.416 --> 03:02:28.757]  Welcome.
[03:02:29.838 --> 03:02:30.459]  Thank you.
[03:02:30.559 --> 03:02:31.661]  God bless you, Alex.
[03:02:31.741 --> 03:02:34.545]  That last color is just still a little lost.
[03:02:35.327 --> 03:02:36.048]  Yeah, pretty scary.
[03:02:36.088 --> 03:02:36.589]  Pretty scary.
[03:02:38.016 --> 03:02:40.017]  We just have to keep praying for them.
[03:02:41.439 --> 03:02:55.151]  Well, I would like to call and let you know I have had four up close and personal, I'm now calling them Jade Helm for lack of better reference, experiences, and I am nobody.
[03:02:56.852 --> 03:03:19.287]  Actually I just had a kind of a revelation and I think that's why I'm talking to you today and I think I know why I'm being personally kind of followed and so, but I'll just say that my youngest son woke me up about five years ago to you and the truth and which led me to my full relationship with Jesus Christ.
[03:03:19.407 --> 03:03:20.347]  Wonderful.
[03:03:21.208 --> 03:03:21.568]  God bless.
[03:03:21.608 --> 03:03:24.610]  So my husband and I were walking into
[03:03:26.639 --> 03:03:39.950]  Well, Fargo, we have just opened up a checking account there, and I had on my InfoWars cap on, and I had been buying all your informational... Sure, and what happened, ma'am?
[03:03:39.970 --> 03:03:40.610]  We're almost out of time.
[03:03:41.525 --> 03:03:57.896]  Okay, oh, there's so many incidences that have happened to me, but Wells Fargo actually, um, I could read her lips to tell her, said, oh, here she comes, now she's coming with an Infowars hat on, and she had a, I'm sorry, a police cop come from the back room and take a picture of me and my husband.
[03:03:57.916 --> 03:03:58.897]  We had to close it down.
[03:03:58.937 --> 03:04:09.545]  Yeah, no, no, ma'am, ma'am, ma'am, what they're doing is they've hired InfraGard, millions, several million at least, who believe they're spies, so they're looking for the terrorists, which is the Patriots,
[03:04:10.465 --> 03:04:16.469]  And so they're there enjoying their new role for during the collapse to then, you know, basically take people away.
[03:04:17.450 --> 03:04:19.431]  And so yes, this stuff is going on.
[03:04:19.451 --> 03:04:20.832]  I would just laugh at them.
[03:04:20.972 --> 03:04:22.233]  And yeah, move your bank account.
[03:04:23.294 --> 03:04:30.499]  And understand this is their attempt to have HUMET to intimidate everybody and freak everybody out while they deny it on the news.
[03:04:30.559 --> 03:04:31.499]  Yes, this is what it's part of.
[03:04:31.519 --> 03:04:35.062]  I've had three more up-close incidences.
[03:04:35.082 --> 03:04:36.623]  Well, you're in California, ma'am.
[03:04:36.643 --> 03:04:37.583]  They've taken that state.
[03:04:37.744 --> 03:04:38.124]  It's theirs.
[03:04:38.928 --> 03:04:43.829]  I've had helicopters actually come and, I mean, if you have time I can tell you what's happened.
[03:04:44.209 --> 03:04:53.752]  But I'm going to tell you that the second incident happened when I was going to talk with my dad because I was just really wanting to inform my dad.
[03:04:53.772 --> 03:04:55.893]  You know, I'm like looking up to my dad to save the world.
[03:04:55.913 --> 03:04:57.913]  Well, ma'am, I gotta jump.
[03:04:57.953 --> 03:04:59.994]  You can call me back sometime, but here's the deal and I apologize.
[03:05:00.654 --> 03:05:04.895]  Some of the stuff's real and then it's meant to trigger even a normal person to get paranoid.
[03:05:05.255 --> 03:05:07.516]  Just love it and don't worry about it.
[03:05:07.956 --> 03:05:10.099]  Everybody gets a helicopter over their house to scan.
