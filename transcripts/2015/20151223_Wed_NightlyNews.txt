[00:00:19.628 --> 00:00:21.689]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:22.990]  I'm your host, Jakari Jackson.
[00:00:23.391 --> 00:00:27.433]  It is December 23rd, 2015, and here's a look at our top stories.
[00:00:30.635 --> 00:00:41.122]  Tonight, on the InfoWars Nightly News, China unveils a new game aimed at keeping you an obedient slave.
[00:00:43.424 --> 00:00:46.666]  And Kurt Russell ramps up his fight on the Second Amendment.
[00:00:48.985 --> 00:00:52.868]  Meanwhile, guns are topping Americans' Christmas wish list.
[00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:59.933]  And Joe Biggs interviews a Trump supporter that the DNC wishes didn't exist.
[00:01:00.613 --> 00:01:04.816]  All that and more on tonight's InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:01:30.233 --> 00:01:31.594]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[00:01:31.875 --> 00:01:33.176]  You can't survive without it.
[00:01:33.356 --> 00:01:34.277]  But where do you get it?
[00:01:34.557 --> 00:01:40.322]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new, groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.
[00:01:40.543 --> 00:01:46.268]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.
[00:01:46.468 --> 00:02:03.329]  Pairing the unprecedented superfiltration power of an all-new Gravity Block Core with a hybrid chromatic shell, it removes up to 99.999% of impurities, including bacteria, viruses, fluoride, disinfectants, volatile organic contaminants, and hormones.
[00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:05.850]  Filter capacity up to 5,000 gallons.
[00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:07.390]  Stainless steel construction.
[00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:08.450]  Easy assembly.
[00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:09.331]  Low maintenance.
[00:02:09.631 --> 00:02:11.451]  Replacement filters are simple to install.

[00:02:33.353 --> 00:02:39.950]  Paul Joseph Watson has a new article out today detailing how China has a credit score system for obedient citizens.
[00:02:40.231 --> 00:02:41.474]  Here's Liane McAdoo with more.
[00:02:42.827 --> 00:02:44.008]  That's right, Jakari.
[00:02:44.228 --> 00:02:48.290]  Now, 1984 was not supposed to be an instruction manual.
[00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:49.390]  It was more of a warning.
[00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:55.113]  But now we are seeing China introducing a credit score for obedient citizens.
[00:02:55.433 --> 00:03:02.576]  Now, this is basically a video game where you earn points by behaving like the government wants you to behave.
[00:03:02.956 --> 00:03:04.377]  So all of China's largest
[00:03:04.597 --> 00:03:05.218]  Thank you so much.
[00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.420]  Yes.
[00:03:39.469 --> 00:03:46.892]  Interestingly, it'll hurt not only your score, but it'll also hurt your friend's score as well, anyone that you interact with on social media.
[00:03:47.252 --> 00:03:53.114]  So this is a larger move for publicly shaming people who post controversial opinions.
[00:03:53.174 --> 00:04:00.716]  Because as we know, in a lot of these Asian countries, shame is absolutely the worst thing that that a person can do, bringing shame upon your family.
[00:04:01.116 --> 00:04:02.097]  And so this is a
[00:04:02.757 --> 00:04:03.017]  I think so.
[00:04:23.727 --> 00:04:27.469]  And the leader of one of these labor rights groups was actually jailed.
[00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:29.791]  Six other people were detained as well.
[00:04:30.231 --> 00:04:35.854]  And these people were just trying to help workers get payment of wages and unpaid benefits.
[00:04:36.175 --> 00:04:41.238]  So these people were riling up these workers and of course that's not allowed so they were jailed.
[00:04:41.658 --> 00:04:48.302]  And so you can see how an internet ID system like this where you're basically earning these credit points for
[00:04:48.302 --> 00:04:48.722]  I think so.
[00:05:08.175 --> 00:05:30.827]  There was a panel entitled cyber violence against women and girls a global wake-up call and these feminists who are part of the whole Gamergate scandal they were basically asking the United Nations to censor the internet the entire internet in order to save their feelings and they even mentioned things like people call us stupid or they disagree with our opinions
[00:05:31.187 --> 00:05:35.928]  And so these are the type of things that these women wanted them to censor the entire Internet because of this.
[00:05:36.528 --> 00:05:43.810]  And of course, we reported in 2014 that the White House is already testing a Chinese-style Internet ID.
[00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:46.971]  They were working on a pilot program in 2014.
[00:05:47.051 --> 00:05:51.692]  It was called the National Strategy for Trusted Identities in Cyberspace.
[00:05:52.132 --> 00:05:56.153]  And this would replace the current system of using passwords to access
[00:05:56.573 --> 00:05:56.853]  Thank you!
[00:06:16.727 --> 00:06:17.047]  I think so.
[00:06:37.321 --> 00:06:38.742]  And of course, that's not it.
[00:06:39.122 --> 00:06:45.405]  If you upload all of your biometric information into a government database, that's leaving it entirely vulnerable to hackers.
[00:06:45.866 --> 00:06:57.812]  As Chris Christie lamented in the last Republican debate, he was upset about the fact that his fingerprints and private information had been scooped up in the latest massive data breach of the government database.
[00:06:58.133 --> 00:07:00.354]  So it's all a very dangerous move.
[00:07:00.814 --> 00:07:02.236]  Dangerous direction we're going in.
[00:07:03.057 --> 00:07:08.303]  In China, their internet ID system, presently this game is opt-in.
[00:07:08.764 --> 00:07:16.153]  Users can decide if they want to go ahead and start using this credit score system, but it is going to become mandatory in 2020.
[00:07:16.634 --> 00:07:17.956]  So will it be headed our way soon?
[00:07:17.976 --> 00:07:18.636]  I don't know.
[00:07:18.917 --> 00:07:19.578]  Back to you, Jakari.
[00:07:20.913 --> 00:07:21.493]  Thanks Leanne.
[00:07:21.934 --> 00:07:25.637]  And we can't talk about obedience without talking about the mighty TSA.
[00:07:25.977 --> 00:07:29.820]  We see the article, now the TSA can force you to go through the body scanner.
[00:07:30.261 --> 00:07:41.690]  This basically documents how DHS has changed procedures to the advanced imagery technology protocols and they're saying that the officers can now insist that travelers go through the controversial machines.
[00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:48.095]  Now it's one thing to insist, hey sir, we would like you to move through this line to speed up the process.
[00:07:48.195 --> 00:07:49.036]  That's one thing.
[00:07:49.116 --> 00:07:53.780]  But if this insistence forces you to miss your flight, that's when I have a problem with it.
[00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:58.184]  Because, you know, working here at InfoWars, I've opted out quite a bit, as well as many other people in the crew.
[00:07:58.884 --> 00:08:05.050]  You go through the procedure, you have to stand there in the line just waiting for somebody to come and get to you eventually, and then you get over there.
[00:08:05.070 --> 00:08:08.853]  I was just talking to Leanne about this earlier, how they take all this stuff out of our bags.
[00:08:08.873 --> 00:08:17.180]  You know, last time I flew, they took toothpaste and eye drops out of my bag, you know, because that's what every terrorist has in their carry-on luggage.
[00:08:18.141 --> 00:08:25.389]  Not to mention that we've seen reports of guys going through the scanners, coming out on the other side with firearms, all type of things going on in their luggage.
[00:08:25.829 --> 00:08:29.874]  And it reminds me of the no-fly list, just the complete security theater of the TSA.
[00:08:30.334 --> 00:08:32.197]  And I had this thought this weekend.
[00:08:32.897 --> 00:08:35.339]  Well, I was thinking about the no-fly, no-gun-by list.
[00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:42.445]  And as bad as I harp on the TSA, and I'm definitely not defending them on this, when you have something like a no-fly list, it's really not up to them.
[00:08:42.585 --> 00:08:48.230]  Because they're subject to the will, in the order, absolute authority of a screen.
[00:08:48.590 --> 00:08:57.758]  If the computer screen pops up and you're an eight-year-old Boy Scout, you know, with your scout, you know, Eagle Scout patch just sold on and the screen says that you can't fly, then you can't fly.
[00:08:57.918 --> 00:08:59.600]  And it's just this complete idiocy
[00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:07.145]  Of these databases and how they want to continue to expand these databases where you really have no judge, no jury.
[00:09:07.505 --> 00:09:13.009]  Now they have added the additional step that if you are on the no-fly list or your name happens to be on there.
[00:09:13.309 --> 00:09:14.590]  Of course, the eight-year-olds aren't on there.
[00:09:14.891 --> 00:09:16.231]  They have a similar name to somebody else.
[00:09:16.291 --> 00:09:22.496]  But if you do get caught up in the no-fly system, you can call and say, hey, why am I on the no-fly system?
[00:09:22.516 --> 00:09:25.898]  But I seriously doubt that's going to get you on a plane in a timely fashion.
[00:09:25.918 --> 00:09:29.341]  I don't think it's something that's going to be resolved in one or two hours or so.
[00:09:29.781 --> 00:09:32.864]  So it's just another thing to worry about when you go through the airports now.
[00:09:33.325 --> 00:09:34.666]  Many people have health concerns.
[00:09:35.247 --> 00:09:39.591]  Pregnant women, you know, say, hey, I don't want to get into this x-ray scanner that you say is safe.
[00:09:39.611 --> 00:09:41.793]  You know, 60 years ago, they said cigarettes were safe.
[00:09:41.893 --> 00:09:49.541]  But pregnant women don't want to get into these machines and have all this radiation going on, not to mention that they can actually see inside your body.
[00:09:49.581 --> 00:09:50.943]  We've seen the videos.
[00:09:51.543 --> 00:09:58.588]  Of various people have put out there have the CSA laugh at your naked body pictures that you can see pretty much what a person looks like under their clothes.
[00:09:58.948 --> 00:09:59.969]  A lot of people aren't having it.
[00:10:00.029 --> 00:10:05.352]  I have a friend who's actually an x-ray technician has a degree for, you know, works at a hospital in Oklahoma.
[00:10:05.372 --> 00:10:08.995]  And he says, hey, when I run my x-ray scanner, I stand behind a lead wall.
[00:10:09.275 --> 00:10:13.518]  Superman can't see behind a lead wall, but everybody else at the TSA just really doesn't seem to mind it.
[00:10:13.558 --> 00:10:15.500]  So we'll see what happens with that.
[00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:16.581]  And I was talking to Alex.
[00:10:16.601 --> 00:10:21.504]  He said he wasn't too happy about it, so he may have some kind of stunt or something else lined up in the near future.
[00:10:21.945 --> 00:10:23.186]  Now let's talk about global warming.
[00:10:24.065 --> 00:10:31.126]  Because you guys probably recall, it's the end of the year now, but at the beginning of the year, they had 2014, the warmest year on record.
[00:10:31.426 --> 00:10:41.208]  And I'm pretty sure there were places that were a little warmer than what they usually are, but they said here, here, here, but they don't want to talk about cities like Chicago, Illinois, the coldest they had been in 100 years.
[00:10:41.248 --> 00:10:45.169]  Detroit, Michigan, the coldest it had been in 100 years, on and on and on.
[00:10:45.589 --> 00:10:49.170]  And now we have this article, because they're talking about how it's super warm in D.C.
[00:10:49.530 --> 00:10:51.270]  Well, if you go to the state of Colorado,
[00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:54.812]  They have a recorded temperature of minus 51 degrees Fahrenheit.
[00:10:54.852 --> 00:10:56.513]  That sounds pretty damn cold to me.
[00:10:57.134 --> 00:11:04.238]  And they say it was verified with another thermometer, both of which have been inspected and approved by the National Weather Service.
[00:11:04.638 --> 00:11:06.480]  And this is the words of a spokesman.
[00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:09.982]  They said the last time the temperature was this cold was on February 8th, 1989.
[00:11:13.484 --> 00:11:16.345]  Yeah, we do see these very cold temperatures, but nobody wants to talk about it.
[00:11:16.666 --> 00:11:24.569]  And once again, I'm not a scientist, I'm not a weatherman, I don't have a super in-depth knowledge of either climate or weather, but this is what I say to everybody.
[00:11:24.989 --> 00:11:27.631]  What is the carbon tax going to do to fix these problems?
[00:11:27.651 --> 00:11:30.252]  Because I just did that report the other day with Rob Jacobson.
[00:11:30.912 --> 00:11:33.973]  All these guys who want you to spend your money on a carbon credit.
[00:11:34.253 --> 00:11:38.553]  You know, you're some guy who rides a bus in Kentucky to your one-bedroom apartment.
[00:11:38.573 --> 00:11:39.874]  They want you to pay a carbon credit.
[00:11:40.174 --> 00:11:42.874]  Meanwhile, they're flying around on these private jets.
[00:11:43.154 --> 00:11:45.155]  They're riding around in these big catered vehicles.
[00:11:45.215 --> 00:11:51.116]  They're renting out entire floors of hotels to have their, you know, their big conferences when they could do it easily over Skype.
[00:11:51.416 --> 00:11:52.356]  They don't want to talk about that.
[00:11:52.396 --> 00:11:55.376]  They want to leave this huge carbon footprint and leave you to pick up the crap.
[00:11:55.696 --> 00:11:56.797]  And I say nay to that.
[00:11:56.817 --> 00:11:58.337]  I don't want anything to do with it.
[00:11:58.837 --> 00:12:01.701]  Now, an inspiring story, or at least was inspiring to me.
[00:12:02.382 --> 00:12:08.851]  We see a lot of Islamophobia going on because of some of the more recent attacks we've seen, not just here in the United States, but around the world.
[00:12:08.891 --> 00:12:10.573]  But this is a very interesting story.
[00:12:11.094 --> 00:12:15.019]  Muslims shield Christians when al-Shabaab attacks a bus in Kenya.
[00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:22.923]  And it basically says some Muslim passengers, mostly of whom were women, they were there when the terrorists came to kill some Christians.
[00:12:23.303 --> 00:12:27.225]  They laid down on the Christians and said, hey, if you want to kill these people, you're going to have to go through us.
[00:12:27.825 --> 00:12:30.746]  And, you know, the rest is history, as they say.
[00:12:30.806 --> 00:12:32.327]  So it's a very inspiring story.
[00:12:32.347 --> 00:12:36.188]  It's something that you can show your friends if they are a bit Islamophobic.
[00:12:36.829 --> 00:12:36.949]  Now,
[00:12:37.947 --> 00:12:40.869]  Let's talk about some things that's going on here in the United States of America.
[00:12:41.570 --> 00:12:54.559]  As we always see in holiday time, especially in the recent years, I guess the Obama years you would call them, Obama being the number one gun salesman probably in the history of the United States of America, firearm sales are at an all-time high.
[00:12:54.579 --> 00:13:00.584]  And it's even being reported on mainstream news outlets like your Today shows and things such as that.
[00:13:01.144 --> 00:13:02.524]  So a lot of people are getting the bug.
[00:13:02.544 --> 00:13:04.465]  They're getting the itch to go out and purchase a firearm.
[00:13:04.545 --> 00:13:07.045]  And these people aren't going out planning mass shootings.
[00:13:07.346 --> 00:13:09.466]  They just say, hey, I don't want Obama to take my guns.
[00:13:09.786 --> 00:13:17.348]  They realize that it's not always going to be a police officer there to protect them, so they want to take the matters into their own hands to protect themselves.
[00:13:18.048 --> 00:13:29.731]  And as we're talking about the police, sometimes they don't always keep you safe, as is the case in this video, where police have destroyed a woman's home searching for a non-existent suspect, and they offer no apology.
[00:13:30.550 --> 00:13:32.808]  Vonda Macklin picks up the pieces.
[00:13:33.638 --> 00:13:35.480]  It's like a destroying of your dream, you know?
[00:13:35.780 --> 00:13:45.128]  After authorities tore up her neighbor's home, poking holes in the walls with an armored military vehicle to coax out the suspect, Joplin Honky member Doug Alexis.
[00:13:45.308 --> 00:13:50.132]  Vonda says the homeowner repeatedly told authorities Alexis was not inside.
[00:13:50.192 --> 00:13:53.955]  She says the single mother of six is devastated after this ordeal.
[00:13:54.175 --> 00:14:00.421]  Probably the most hardest part of seeing him there was just rip her Christmas tree up and, you know, and out the window he goes.
[00:14:01.181 --> 00:14:01.821]  Don't get me wrong.
[00:14:01.881 --> 00:14:07.363]  As we watch this story, you see the big military type vehicle that they use to poke holes in this lady's house.
[00:14:07.703 --> 00:14:08.604]  Completely unnecessary.
[00:14:08.644 --> 00:14:09.484]  The guy wasn't there.
[00:14:09.524 --> 00:14:12.865]  They got some fraudulent information as many times they often do.
[00:14:12.885 --> 00:14:19.008]  You know, we've seen countless examples of SWAT teams going to the wrong person's house or they go to the house the person isn't there.
[00:14:19.028 --> 00:14:25.350]  You know, they scare somebody's grandma to death and blow little holes in baby's faces and all kinds of stuff with flashbang grenades.
[00:14:25.670 --> 00:14:27.891]  It's completely ridiculous, over the top, almost
[00:14:28.371 --> 00:14:33.512]  If people weren't getting hurt, it would be kind of cartoonish and funny, but people are getting hurt, and that's the issue about it.
[00:14:33.852 --> 00:14:45.414]  Now, on the flip side of that, I can see the body armor, I can see the military vehicles used for practical purpose, because, of course, we do know there are things like school shootings, there are things like floods.
[00:14:45.494 --> 00:14:46.975]  I saw a video about it here in Texas.
[00:14:46.995 --> 00:14:56.597]  You know, we had some real heavy flooding, and some of the officers were using the big military-type vehicles, MRAPs, things of that sort, to navigate through the heavy waters and get people in and out of their homes.
[00:14:56.637 --> 00:14:57.877]  So, yes, I do understand
[00:14:58.197 --> 00:15:06.519]  There is a practical application for these type of vehicles and other armaments here in the United States of America, but this is case in point how they're not supposed to be used.
[00:15:06.539 --> 00:15:09.639]  You're not supposed to use these to terrorize an innocent person.
[00:15:09.659 --> 00:15:13.200]  You're not supposed to use these to tear gas peaceful protesters.
[00:15:13.220 --> 00:15:21.821]  You know, things did turn hairy in Ferguson, but when I first got there, there were people peacefully assembled in the streets and cops were aiming guns at them with laser dots on their chest.
[00:15:21.841 --> 00:15:24.722]  Surprisingly, that didn't make it on any mainstream news outlets.
[00:15:25.362 --> 00:15:28.826]  Thousands of prisoners mistakenly freed early in Washington State.
[00:15:29.307 --> 00:15:38.859]  And this documents how about 3,000 prisoners were released early because, I guess at a time back in 2002, they were running a program letting people off for good behavior.
[00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:42.383]  But when the program ended, they were still allowing people to get out.
[00:15:42.964 --> 00:15:43.304]  I think so.
[00:16:04.011 --> 00:16:05.992]  Now we're going to end talking about some political news.
[00:16:06.612 --> 00:16:14.414]  If you like social media and you like to swipe left, swipe right for Twitter, or excuse me, Tinder, now they have Tinder for politics.
[00:16:14.974 --> 00:16:21.917]  And it documents how there are about 46 million voters in the millennial generation who did not vote in the midterm election.
[00:16:21.937 --> 00:16:23.957]  So one developer created Voter.
[00:16:24.397 --> 00:16:29.299]  It's a smartphone app designed to motivate millennials to engage in the political process.
[00:16:29.799 --> 00:16:34.443]  And you can download the app and you answer a few questions like, what are your views on marijuana?
[00:16:34.483 --> 00:16:36.064]  Should we abolish the death penalty?
[00:16:36.124 --> 00:16:37.105]  So on and so forth.
[00:16:37.445 --> 00:16:38.466]  And it's just like Tinder.
[00:16:38.866 --> 00:16:44.110]  You swipe left, you swipe right, and it gives you the people who most closely align with your political beliefs.
[00:16:44.611 --> 00:16:49.214]  Now, once again, I haven't used this thing personally, so buyer beware if you do download the app.
[00:16:49.234 --> 00:16:53.557]  But you know, it's something interesting and may get people a little more active in politics.
[00:16:53.918 --> 00:16:56.320]  And one person who is very active in politics
[00:16:56.860 --> 00:17:04.970]  Donald Trump, and we see a poll saying that many people would not embrace Trump as president, and actually some would be embarrassed if he did become president.
[00:17:05.010 --> 00:17:10.977]  Now, to be fair, the majority of the people who said that are Democrats, so you got to take that with a grain of salt.
[00:17:11.398 --> 00:17:13.640]  But we had a chance to speak to somebody earlier today.
[00:17:14.161 --> 00:17:14.541]  I don't know.
[00:17:31.099 --> 00:17:35.363]  If the election happened tomorrow, I would not personally vote for the guy, but to each his own.
[00:17:35.403 --> 00:17:39.106]  She's going to break it down all to us coming up in the next segment.
[00:17:39.426 --> 00:17:45.052]  But stay tuned, we have many more special reports coming up after that, right here on the Info Wars Nightly News.
[00:17:59.474 --> 00:18:02.020]  This is an American president.
[00:18:02.381 --> 00:18:03.523]  Just add puppet.
[00:18:03.904 --> 00:18:06.149]  Then vote and repeat every four years.
[00:18:16.314 --> 00:18:21.256]  Shane Steiner's involvement with InfoWarsLife.com truly happened in an organic way.
[00:18:21.376 --> 00:18:29.980]  I went to high school with Shane, his brother, knew his parents well, and he was visiting the office once, hadn't been in the office in years, and said, wow, I noticed you're making and selling supplements.
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:30.760]  Do these really work?
[00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:35.862]  Because I've tried a lot of supplements as a workout enthusiast, and I really think most of them are hype.
[00:18:35.902 --> 00:18:37.403]  And I said, here, take some home, try it.
[00:18:37.483 --> 00:18:44.048]  Well, a few weeks later, he came in, blown away, and said, I want to buy three boxes of this stuff to give my friends and family.
[00:18:44.468 --> 00:18:45.969]  It's simply amazing.
[00:18:46.009 --> 00:18:47.290]  He said, why does it work so well?
[00:18:47.330 --> 00:18:51.854]  And I said, listen, go to Infowarslife.com, watch the informational videos with Dr. Group and others.
[00:18:52.074 --> 00:18:53.575]  They understand how it all works.
[00:18:53.855 --> 00:18:55.436]  I know that it works for me.
[00:18:55.556 --> 00:18:56.697]  That's all I understand.
[00:18:56.957 --> 00:19:02.001]  The science, the facts, the research, people's testimonials, they're all on Infowarslife.com.
[00:19:02.021 --> 00:19:03.002]  You can check it out for yourself.
[00:19:03.602 --> 00:19:04.683]  I wanted to go to the gym.
[00:19:04.943 --> 00:19:14.788]  I wanted to push myself and work out harder, and that led to me being able to come out and do stuff like the barefooting and the surfing and stuff like that, which I would have never done.
[00:19:14.808 --> 00:19:17.329]  I never would have done that two years ago.
[00:19:17.929 --> 00:19:21.551]  Shane has said over and over again, more than just libido and energy,
[00:19:22.111 --> 00:19:23.873]  It made him want to get into the gym more.
[00:19:24.214 --> 00:19:25.675]  It made him want to get in better shape.
[00:19:25.715 --> 00:19:28.338]  And believe me, the Steiners have amazing genetics.
[00:19:28.879 --> 00:19:31.322]  His brother is a world champion steer wrestler.
[00:19:31.662 --> 00:19:35.647]  His dad, Bobby Steiner, is a famous world champion bull rider.
[00:19:35.847 --> 00:19:37.509]  They've got natural genetics.
[00:19:37.949 --> 00:19:42.675]  But when you added this to the mix, in Shane's own words, it took him to the next level.
[00:19:54.972 --> 00:19:56.673]  Shane noticed the mental clarity.
[00:19:57.134 --> 00:20:00.616]  Bobby was able to work out longer and gain muscle mass.
[00:20:00.736 --> 00:20:02.037]  He's already completely shredded.
[00:20:02.237 --> 00:20:04.899]  I gotta admit, for me, the biggest effect has been libido.
[00:20:05.259 --> 00:20:11.303]  Now, I've never claimed to have a body like some beach model, but back when I was 20, 22 years old and worked out every day, I looked great.
[00:20:11.343 --> 00:20:17.368]  But over the years and being married, having three kids, working 18 hours a day, I gained basically 100 pounds.
[00:20:17.508 --> 00:20:20.650]  And it's been a long process of losing that weight in the last four years.
[00:20:20.810 --> 00:20:23.392]  But if you look at the photos and the videos,
[00:20:23.752 --> 00:20:24.112]  We're good to go.
[00:20:42.837 --> 00:20:52.901]  This has actually made me feel so good that here lately, about a year ago, I started training jiu-jitsu and that kind of led to doing some boxing and kickboxing.
[00:20:52.921 --> 00:21:05.407]  I mean, it's amazing that two years ago I was on the couch and couldn't even tie my shoes and now I'm training with MMA fighters and just doing stuff that I never thought that I would be doing ever again.
[00:21:05.667 --> 00:21:07.528]  So, Supermail Vitality has
[00:21:08.408 --> 00:21:08.929]  I don't know.
[00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:19.140]  You'll love it.
[00:22:03.063 --> 00:22:12.425]  Bottom line folks, you want to discover the power of super male vitality and super female vitality for yourself by visiting InfoWarsLife.com today or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:22:19.563 --> 00:22:25.970]  I guess one of the thumbnail of the video is a young lady wearing one of our own Hillary for Prison t-shirts.
[00:22:26.451 --> 00:22:30.596]  There it is right there, and her name is Linda LeChage.
[00:22:31.037 --> 00:22:32.238]  LeChage, is that how you say it?
[00:22:32.298 --> 00:22:33.159]  I believe so.
[00:22:33.319 --> 00:22:34.601]  I'm calling her Trump Girl now.
[00:22:34.801 --> 00:22:35.642]  Trump girl, yeah.
[00:22:35.682 --> 00:22:38.424]  So we're going to have her on in a little bit to talk about why she did this.
[00:22:38.864 --> 00:22:46.610]  But just, you know, and she did it because her uncle, I guess, is a fan of Infowars and, you know, bought her a shirt.
[00:22:47.050 --> 00:22:49.972]  And so she decided to get active, get off the couch and go do something.
[00:22:50.393 --> 00:22:52.034]  And then she's interviewed by the media.
[00:22:52.274 --> 00:22:54.156]  She gets to put out the idea about the left-right paradigm.
[00:22:54.216 --> 00:22:56.717]  I mean, all kind of stuff just happens just by wearing a shirt to an event.
[00:22:56.898 --> 00:22:57.958]  Yeah, it's an amazing shirt.
[00:22:57.978 --> 00:23:02.202]  I mean, that's why I always encourage people to go and pick one up, because, you know, when I wore it... Show them the shirt.
[00:23:02.822 --> 00:23:03.863]  There it is, right there.
[00:23:04.344 --> 00:23:09.769]  You know, I wore it back to the Trump rally, had a fan ovation of about like 10,000 people.
[00:23:09.789 --> 00:23:14.373]  Everyone wanted to take pictures, you know, get in a conversation, debate over it, whether they liked it or not.
[00:23:14.413 --> 00:23:15.554]  Everybody there obviously liked it.
[00:23:15.595 --> 00:23:16.596]  Outdoors, not so much.
[00:23:16.996 --> 00:23:20.940]  Then we went to the Hillary Clinton rally and I wore it there amongst the wolves.
[00:23:21.460 --> 00:23:21.760]  Yeah.
[00:23:21.860 --> 00:23:24.281]  And there was a lot of supporters on the outside of the fence that were there.
[00:23:24.321 --> 00:23:36.666]  So I mean, it's a great shirt to stir up debate, talk about issues, and it's really awesome to see the people smile when they see it because you can tell who's not a lifeless soul walking around like some zombie that's just ready to vote for Hillary.
[00:23:36.826 --> 00:23:38.126]  Totally, totally agree.
[00:23:38.146 --> 00:23:40.887]  We're going to get into some TSA news as well coming up.
[00:23:40.967 --> 00:23:42.708]  And also, I want to take your phone calls.
[00:23:43.428 --> 00:23:43.848]  We're good to go.
[00:24:13.308 --> 00:24:13.488]  Yeah.
[00:24:13.749 --> 00:24:15.671]  You know, a lot of people were like, I can't do it.
[00:24:15.711 --> 00:24:17.232]  I don't have any room.
[00:24:17.292 --> 00:24:17.853]  I'm too poor.
[00:24:18.073 --> 00:24:18.694]  But bring them in.
[00:24:18.954 --> 00:24:19.335]  Bring them in.
[00:24:19.375 --> 00:24:20.976]  The best one was from San Francisco.
[00:24:21.177 --> 00:24:23.199]  She's like, no, we live in San Francisco.
[00:24:23.239 --> 00:24:24.180]  San Francisco is too full.
[00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:25.381]  We don't have any more room for them.
[00:24:25.401 --> 00:24:28.584]  So you've got room to bring in people and make them homeless, but there's no way.
[00:24:28.825 --> 00:24:30.847]  Let's bring in homeless people and not give them any shelter then.
[00:24:31.107 --> 00:24:33.609]  Well, speaking of bringing people in, let's bring our guest on.
[00:24:33.689 --> 00:24:35.410]  She's joining us via video Skype.
[00:24:35.430 --> 00:24:39.153]  She's a junior studying engineering at Michigan State University.
[00:24:39.574 --> 00:24:40.775]  She's a first-time voter.
[00:24:40.795 --> 00:24:42.776]  She's 20 years old, so this will be her first election.
[00:24:42.816 --> 00:24:46.559]  So she's getting in, you know, at I guess the first chance she could get in.
[00:24:46.599 --> 00:24:50.923]  I remember I think I was 18 when I was able to vote the first time, and that was a Clinton election.
[00:24:50.943 --> 00:24:51.883]  That's how old I am.
[00:24:53.245 --> 00:24:54.646]  But anyway, let's bring her on.
[00:24:54.726 --> 00:24:56.387]  Her name is Linda LaChage.
[00:24:56.707 --> 00:24:57.268]  Linda, how you doing?
[00:24:59.221 --> 00:25:00.102]  I'm good, it's LeShy.
[00:25:00.122 --> 00:25:02.004]  LeShy, alright, there you go.
[00:25:02.024 --> 00:25:07.010]  Oh, so it's a silent I at the end of the J. LeShy.
[00:25:07.291 --> 00:25:17.704]  So, Linda, tell us why you decided to wear the Hillary for Prison shirt to that Trump rally and talk about, you know, I know you got interviewed by the media, but what were other people coming up and saying to you?
[00:25:19.363 --> 00:25:27.290]  Well, I decided to get the shirt when I was buying Deep Cleanse as a conversation starter, and I've worn it a lot of places.
[00:25:27.310 --> 00:25:37.939]  I've worn it around campus, and I decided to wear it to the Trump Rally because I know people there are awake, and I wanted it as a conversation starter.
[00:25:38.340 --> 00:25:41.983]  You know, when I wore it around campus, a lot of people just laughed it off.
[00:25:43.078 --> 00:26:00.381]  And until I started talking to them about it and about why Hillary should be in prison, about the Benghazi scandal, and about her emails in the video, and it really amazes me how not awake the general public is.
[00:26:01.161 --> 00:26:03.522]  I think it's the political correctness wave that's going on.
[00:26:03.562 --> 00:26:05.443]  That people are scared to take a stance.
[00:26:21.889 --> 00:26:27.112]  So they'd rather be sheep and not say anything and not be involved.
[00:26:27.692 --> 00:26:33.355]  And people look both ways before they talk because they're scared of offending someone.
[00:26:33.475 --> 00:26:36.656]  What do students say to you around college campus?
[00:26:36.676 --> 00:26:42.519]  Because my experience at college campuses here in Texas, like at UT, they're super liberal.
[00:26:42.679 --> 00:26:44.300]  They love Hillary Clinton.
[00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:47.421]  They're ready for her like I'm ready for a brand new gun for Christmas.
[00:26:47.481 --> 00:26:50.263]  So what kind of responses do you get there on campus?
[00:26:51.943 --> 00:26:53.065]  I get a lot of laughs.
[00:26:53.466 --> 00:26:59.236]  I get a lot of told that I'm racist and that I have it all wrong.
[00:27:03.035 --> 00:27:06.238]  I try to enlighten them and tell them, are you involved?
[00:27:06.318 --> 00:27:07.520]  Are you really educated?
[00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:14.947]  Do you watch the committees that are taking place trying to investigate in the Hillary Clinton Benghazi scandal?
[00:27:15.087 --> 00:27:22.435]  And most of the time people say that they don't believe it and they think that it's a Republican scam to try to bring her down.
[00:27:23.683 --> 00:27:25.485]  Yeah, that's the way they always frame it.
[00:27:25.625 --> 00:27:29.890]  Anytime somebody is caught doing wrong, Republican or Democrat, they say, oh, it's just politics.
[00:27:29.910 --> 00:27:30.671]  It's really not anything.
[00:27:30.992 --> 00:27:33.114]  Lying, killing people, it's all politics.
[00:27:33.134 --> 00:27:34.696]  It has nothing to do with real life.
[00:27:34.756 --> 00:27:38.160]  And if we were to do the things that Hillary Clinton has done, we would all be in prison.
[00:27:38.601 --> 00:27:39.001]  Exactly.
[00:27:39.041 --> 00:27:39.522]  That's just it.
[00:27:41.704 --> 00:27:44.946]  You know, I guess you're going through this political correctness stuff being on campus.
[00:27:45.086 --> 00:27:49.689]  When I was in college in the 90s, it was there, but not nearly as bad as it is now.
[00:27:49.709 --> 00:27:51.330]  I mean, it's off the hook now.
[00:27:51.650 --> 00:27:54.231]  And now we had this story come out from Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:27:54.571 --> 00:27:57.953]  Coming to America, China introduces credit score for obedient citizens.
[00:27:58.394 --> 00:28:02.836]  And what's happening now at your colleges is what's going to come to the rest of us.
[00:28:02.896 --> 00:28:09.060]  It's going to be a bunch of ninnying, whining people, trendies, running around telling you what you can say and what you can't say.
[00:28:09.560 --> 00:28:15.824]  It's no longer a report card for your education, but it's your permanent record report card about how you act.
[00:28:17.285 --> 00:28:20.428]  Linda, what kind of stuff are they doing just in general?
[00:28:20.468 --> 00:28:22.229]  Not necessarily to you, but like at your school?
[00:28:22.249 --> 00:28:23.630]  Have they banned the word Christmas?
[00:28:24.030 --> 00:28:26.552]  Have they banned Christmas decorations?
[00:28:26.592 --> 00:28:27.953]  Have they banned certain sayings?
[00:28:28.173 --> 00:28:29.134]  What are they doing at your school?
[00:28:30.874 --> 00:28:31.895]  Not necessarily.
[00:28:31.955 --> 00:28:33.576]  I don't really see much of that.
[00:28:33.656 --> 00:28:37.799]  I just see the students more so being quiet.
[00:28:37.819 --> 00:28:43.303]  The students not wanting to engage in talking about the news.
[00:28:43.924 --> 00:28:47.126]  More people like to talk about the latest trends.
[00:28:48.748 --> 00:28:51.770]  Or, um, what's going to happen on E!
[00:28:51.810 --> 00:28:52.230]  News.
[00:28:52.350 --> 00:28:58.355]  A lot of people aren't involved in, um, knowing what is happening in the government, nor do they want to be.
[00:28:58.375 --> 00:29:05.460]  That's why, but I was actually very surprised because when I went to the Trump rally, we drove about three hours to go there.
[00:29:05.820 --> 00:29:07.401]  There was a lot of young people there.
[00:29:07.421 --> 00:29:09.683]  So I was very pleased about that.
[00:29:10.202 --> 00:29:22.654]  Yeah, you know, I've found, especially with the internet, people who really want to get informed and who aren't just interested in the basic American culture, you know, that pop culture out there, are able to get the information, get informed, and get active.
[00:29:22.674 --> 00:29:29.260]  Because, I tell you, the tools that are out there with the internet now, you can really reach a lot more people than you could with just, you know, standing at a street corner.
[00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:34.922]  What I don't get is how people are so, you know, into the pop culture stuff, though, because of the drama.
[00:29:35.243 --> 00:29:35.563]  Guess what?
[00:29:35.583 --> 00:29:36.263]  Get into politics.
[00:29:36.283 --> 00:29:37.083]  There's a lot of drama.
[00:29:37.103 --> 00:29:38.104]  There's a lot of stuff going on.
[00:29:38.124 --> 00:29:39.224]  There's a lot of backstabbing.
[00:29:39.745 --> 00:29:41.926]  It is better than reality TV.
[00:29:41.966 --> 00:29:42.766]  It is reality.
[00:29:42.786 --> 00:29:43.486]  It is happening.
[00:29:43.947 --> 00:29:46.047]  And it affects your future and everyone else's.
[00:29:46.468 --> 00:29:54.351]  So I just don't understand why more people aren't really into the politics, why they aren't, you know, just diving in and trying to find out about what's going on.
[00:29:54.811 --> 00:29:55.892]  Because it's better at the end of the day.
[00:29:55.912 --> 00:29:58.233]  I mean, who cares what Kanye West or Kim Kardashian do?
[00:29:58.573 --> 00:30:01.516]  That's ridiculous.
[00:30:02.757 --> 00:30:08.723]  I really think that people take for granted what America is right now, having their free speech.
[00:30:08.763 --> 00:30:14.929]  They don't really realize that it could all be changed in a matter of months, years.
[00:30:15.610 --> 00:30:19.534]  And I think people really need to wake up and realize that this is a very important
[00:30:20.454 --> 00:30:24.756]  That America, the government, has been totally corrupt.
[00:30:24.856 --> 00:30:26.156]  Washington is totally corrupt.
[00:30:26.656 --> 00:30:30.677]  I think that people don't realize that this all can change.
[00:30:30.858 --> 00:30:33.518]  That pop culture won't matter soon enough.
[00:30:33.678 --> 00:30:38.720]  And exactly what you said, what Kanye West is wearing and Kim Kardashian is wearing.
[00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:44.162]  That's why the youth needs to wake up and everyone, the general public needs to wake up.
[00:30:44.562 --> 00:30:52.184]  And really get informed and vote because this election is one that's really going to determine the fate of America.
[00:30:52.304 --> 00:30:53.544]  Do you share the show often?
[00:30:53.764 --> 00:30:56.165]  Are you able to get the show out to other people and help them wake up at all?
[00:30:57.285 --> 00:31:00.566]  Oh yeah, I watched the show when I was studying for finals.
[00:31:00.906 --> 00:31:02.667]  People are asking me, what are you watching?
[00:31:02.687 --> 00:31:03.527]  And I'm like, InfoWars.
[00:31:03.547 --> 00:31:10.749]  Do you want to give out a Twitter handle or anything like that to bring people to you and wherever you're doing your activism, getting people active?
[00:31:11.877 --> 00:31:12.257]  Sure!
[00:31:12.317 --> 00:31:19.321]  My Twitter name is Lynn, and then two underscores L. Alright.
[00:31:19.521 --> 00:31:20.662]  Guys, see if y'all can pull that up.
[00:31:20.762 --> 00:31:26.485]  Lynn, two underscores L. And do you have anything else you want to add?
[00:31:26.845 --> 00:31:33.909]  Young people out there who might be thinking about just sitting on the couch for the rest, you know, the rest of their college career and phoning it in, as I should say?
[00:31:34.488 --> 00:31:35.069]  Right.
[00:31:35.209 --> 00:31:47.800]  I just want to say that the reason I like Trump is because I think that he's saying a lot of what the people that are actually involved in knowing what their government is doing and are informed about the corruptness.
[00:31:47.860 --> 00:31:53.365]  I feel like he's actually saying it out loud and telling us like no other politician has told us.
[00:31:53.405 --> 00:31:54.546]  He exposed the Clintons.
[00:31:54.586 --> 00:31:56.307]  He exposed the Bushes.
[00:31:58.028 --> 00:32:08.871]  I think that young people and older people alike that aren't involved need to think about what they want for their children and what they want to do in life.
[00:32:08.971 --> 00:32:25.675]  If you want to pay high taxes your whole life, if you want to not own your own business, if you want to not be your own boss one day or even make a great living, you need to really educate yourself and think about who you want to vote for.
[00:32:27.153 --> 00:32:30.676]  You guys have the exclusive for it, which is a product called Deep Cleanse.
[00:32:30.936 --> 00:32:36.421]  And why I'm so excited about it is it's a unique formula, almost like the iodine crystals.
[00:32:36.521 --> 00:32:40.284]  We have two unique products that nobody in the world has.
[00:32:40.664 --> 00:32:52.454]  One of the most amazing ingredients in the world, and it's called Shilajit, and it's actually known as blood of the mountain or rock sweat because thousands of years ago, as a matter of fact, this ingredient
[00:32:52.634 --> 00:32:59.038]  Was only given to the elite of the elite thousands of years ago up in the Himalayan mountains and in Tibet.
[00:32:59.078 --> 00:33:02.901]  And we wanted to put this in stuff for a couple years, but we couldn't get an organic form.
[00:33:03.081 --> 00:33:03.301]  Right.
[00:33:03.401 --> 00:33:04.422]  I mean, let's explain.
[00:33:04.482 --> 00:33:07.624]  I mean, this stuff's so good, we couldn't put it out for years.
[00:33:07.904 --> 00:33:16.353]  Right, so I had to actually, it's kind of like the iodine crystals, finding a source deep in the earth that we could get the cleanest source available.
[00:33:16.793 --> 00:33:26.363]  But in Tibet and in Nepal and in the Himalayan mountains, thousands of years ago they found, they watched these monkeys and during the summer months the monkeys would go up into the mountains.
[00:33:26.384 --> 00:33:27.625]  Now you're being racist against monkeys.
[00:33:27.665 --> 00:33:28.306]  And they would pick
[00:33:28.806 --> 00:33:31.207]  This black substance from the mountains.
[00:33:31.668 --> 00:33:38.171]  And so in Russia, they actually, it grows in Russia and the mountains and in the Himalayas and only in the summer.
[00:33:38.272 --> 00:33:46.476]  And shilajit is actually the decomposition of up to 7,000 different medicinal herbs.
[00:33:46.536 --> 00:33:53.200]  So it decomposes, all these different herbs decompose in the Himalayan mountains and the volcanic soil up there.
[00:33:53.460 --> 00:33:57.483]  And what happens in the summertime... So it's almost like an oil from
[00:33:58.343 --> 00:34:01.046]  Yes, it's high in fulvic acid, it's high in humic acid.
[00:34:01.086 --> 00:34:05.411]  Because they're always claiming oil is really from decomposed animals and plants.
[00:34:05.972 --> 00:34:10.417]  There is some oil that is based from fossils, but most of it's really abiotic.
[00:34:10.818 --> 00:34:14.823]  So this is a true fossil source?
[00:34:14.843 --> 00:34:15.583]  I mean, explain it to me.
[00:34:16.284 --> 00:34:22.345]  It's really the decomposition, like I said, of over 7,000 different medicinal herbs and plants.
[00:34:22.505 --> 00:34:26.306]  And with the rocks and the pressure deep in the mountains, it freezes.
[00:34:26.386 --> 00:34:31.327]  And during the summertime, and the pressures build it up, it oozes out.
[00:34:31.427 --> 00:34:33.007]  So it literally oozes out of the mountain.
[00:34:33.027 --> 00:34:33.827]  It's like rock sap.
[00:34:34.187 --> 00:34:35.188]  It's like rock sap.
[00:34:35.228 --> 00:34:38.348]  It's black and it's highly nutritious.
[00:34:39.188 --> 00:34:41.809]  Even in the 1980s, when the Olympic
[00:34:42.529 --> 00:34:44.850]  Athletes in Russia were accused of being on steroids.
[00:34:44.890 --> 00:34:52.231]  They found out that they were actually been given Shilajit because it works as an anabolic as well and it builds muscles.
[00:34:52.431 --> 00:34:53.491]  It's a big dose in there.
[00:34:53.511 --> 00:35:03.234]  The second big main ingredient in there is a volcanic zeolite concentrate and what this formula is designed to do, the Shilajit and the zeolites have a real strong negative charge.
[00:35:03.694 --> 00:35:08.615]  All the metals and chemicals and PCBs and VOCs have positive charges.
[00:35:09.415 --> 00:35:17.522]  So these go in, they grab it, and then they safely eliminate it through the body so you can become healthy.
[00:35:17.563 --> 00:35:21.506]  I mean, this is an amazing formula.
[00:35:21.646 --> 00:35:27.512]  I wish I actually had it, but because this was an exclusive InfoWars Life product, you're the only one in the world that has.
[00:35:28.132 --> 00:35:36.039]  This formula now and, you know, there is going to be a limited supply available when you sell out because you can only harvest this once a year.
[00:35:36.199 --> 00:35:37.260]  How do people take it?
[00:35:37.300 --> 00:35:39.622]  How is it recommended that this be done?
[00:35:39.722 --> 00:35:41.424]  Just a daily dose?
[00:35:41.704 --> 00:35:43.446]  Yeah, daily dose.
[00:35:43.526 --> 00:35:44.907]  The instructions are on the label.
[00:35:44.927 --> 00:35:48.330]  You know, of course, I kind of modify it for each individual.
[00:35:48.350 --> 00:35:49.931]  It depends on what your lifestyle is.
[00:35:49.971 --> 00:35:55.076]  I mean, honestly, the best thing to do is for you to avoid all these chemicals and toxins in your environment.
[00:35:55.376 --> 00:35:55.456]  Yeah.
[00:36:17.475 --> 00:36:18.396]  These aren't just great products.
[00:36:18.416 --> 00:36:20.197]  This is how we fund this independent operation.
[00:36:20.217 --> 00:36:25.421]  We're not taxpayer-funded like MSNBC or NPR, and neither is your local station, so support them, folks.
[00:36:25.621 --> 00:36:26.242]  This is a war.
[00:36:39.059 --> 00:36:54.884]  Now that the Omnibus Bill has firmly planted its clutches on the internet via the CISA legislation that was buried inside of it and Obama signed into law, we can now put under the microscope a totalitarian example seeping into our previously protected online identities.
[00:36:55.124 --> 00:37:03.247]  China's largest social networks have partnered with the country's communist government to create a credit score system that will measure how obedient its citizens are.
[00:37:03.487 --> 00:37:15.935]  Entitled Sesame Credit, the program aims to create a docile, compliant citizenry who are fiscally and morally responsible by employing a game-like format to create self-imposed group social control.
[00:37:16.115 --> 00:37:20.197]  In other words, China gamified peer pressure to control its citizenry.
[00:37:20.337 --> 00:37:27.302]  And though the scheme hasn't been fully implemented yet, it's already working insidiously well, reports Zero Hedge.
[00:37:27.622 --> 00:37:30.904]  Sesame Credit is operated by Alibaba and Tencent.
[00:37:31.044 --> 00:37:37.829]  Two companies that run all the top social networks in China, including Weibo, which has over 200 million users.
[00:37:38.089 --> 00:37:43.853]  It works by measuring not only purchase and bill paying history, but also political compliance.
[00:37:44.093 --> 00:37:45.193]  The ACLU warns,
[00:38:01.364 --> 00:38:01.845]  We're good to go.
[00:38:21.238 --> 00:38:24.059]  At any point, anybody can check anyone else's score.
[00:38:24.239 --> 00:38:30.121]  And when you check your own score, Sesame Credit provides a handy map of your friends to show you who's dragging your score down.
[00:38:30.202 --> 00:38:30.942]  Social pressure?
[00:38:31.302 --> 00:38:32.082]  Ostracization?
[00:38:32.382 --> 00:38:33.563]  Those things are free.
[00:38:33.803 --> 00:38:34.803]  They happen on their own.
[00:38:35.083 --> 00:38:40.425]  And as a government tool, they don't have nearly the same potential for going embarrassingly, disastrously wrong.
[00:38:40.706 --> 00:38:46.688]  With a system like this in place, a government doesn't even have to tell neighbor to spy on neighbor to rat each other out.
[00:38:47.008 --> 00:38:50.171]  Because that's all built into a seemingly innocuous game system.
[00:38:50.491 --> 00:38:51.853]  The government need not step in.
[00:38:52.253 --> 00:38:57.598]  Re-education will be handled for them by friends, classmates, and relatives who want to maintain a high score.
[00:38:57.838 --> 00:39:07.368]  Johan Lagerwist also warns that the program will scrutinize what people read, labeling it akin to Amazon's consumer tracking with an Orwellian political twist.
[00:39:07.788 --> 00:39:11.709]  Sesame Credit is currently opt-in only, but it's set to become mandatory by 2020.
[00:39:12.630 --> 00:39:16.591]  So how does this translate in the supposedly free Republic of the United States?
[00:39:16.831 --> 00:39:28.615]  Well, for years, the Obama administration's White House has been pushing cybersecurity initiatives that would mandate de facto government permission to use the Internet, since web access would be linked with an individual user's identity.
[00:39:28.875 --> 00:39:33.017]  It could easily be restricted if that individual dares to dissent against the state.
[00:39:33.377 --> 00:39:36.878]  I'm bound to classify you as unmutual!
[00:39:41.481 --> 00:39:54.672]  If we continue to treat the feelings of perpetually offended, outraged mobs with more importance than free speech, particularly controversial and unpopular free speech, there will be no need for governments to impose a social credit score to control citizens.
[00:39:54.893 --> 00:40:02.279]  We're already imposing that on ourselves by default, as Obama's New World Order agenda gains strength while we all sit and watch.
[00:40:02.639 --> 00:40:03.980]  John Bowne for InfoWars.com
[00:40:13.277 --> 00:40:18.805]  You know, Australia's a good example, Canada's a good example, the UK is a good example.
[00:40:18.865 --> 00:40:19.166]  Why?
[00:40:20.307 --> 00:40:22.170]  Because each of them had mass killings.
[00:40:22.671 --> 00:40:27.758]  Somebody, somewhere will comment and say, Obama politicized this issue.
[00:40:28.646 --> 00:40:31.188]  Well, this is something we should politicize.
[00:40:31.869 --> 00:40:32.850]  I'm not going to carry a gun.
[00:40:32.870 --> 00:40:34.512]  I don't want to be involved in a gun fight.
[00:40:34.632 --> 00:40:47.284]  If I could have gotten 51 votes in the Senate of the United States for an outright ban picking up every one of them, Mr. and Mrs. America, turn them all in.
[00:40:52.709 --> 00:40:53.150]  Go ahead.
[00:40:54.264 --> 00:40:55.204]  Make my day.
[00:40:55.765 --> 00:40:59.686]  So the notion that gun laws don't work, it's not borne out by the evidence.
[00:41:00.126 --> 00:41:05.548]  He says that the Chicago police had a plan over this bloody 4th of July weekend.
[00:41:05.948 --> 00:41:14.412]  Nonetheless, as you indicated, Corey, there was a count of casualties that could have been from Afghanistan or Iraq.
[00:41:14.752 --> 00:41:15.232]  We'll make it
[00:41:16.481 --> 00:41:19.362]  Harder for law-abiding citizens and criminals will still get their guns.
[00:41:19.802 --> 00:41:26.983]  In many cases the offenders, felons, some out on parole, some out on bond.
[00:41:27.323 --> 00:41:34.285]  We have to respect the tradition in this country of people who want to defend themselves and their family from violence.
[00:41:34.465 --> 00:41:37.906]  There are people at high levels in this government who have
[00:41:38.966 --> 00:41:40.428]  Bodyguards.
[00:41:40.649 --> 00:41:42.571]  24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
[00:41:42.932 --> 00:41:44.974]  The average American does not have that.
[00:41:45.315 --> 00:41:49.180]  Mayor Bloomberg, why can you defend yourself but not...
[00:41:50.046 --> 00:41:51.127]  The majority of Americans.
[00:41:51.167 --> 00:41:53.270]  I mean, look at the team of security you've got!
[00:41:53.670 --> 00:41:56.033]  Every day, every school, at every level.
[00:41:56.513 --> 00:42:02.280]  One thing that I think is clear with young people, and with adults as well, is that we just have to be repetitive about this.
[00:42:02.320 --> 00:42:09.288]  And we need to do this every day of the week, and just really brainwash people into thinking about guns in a vastly different way.
[00:42:09.688 --> 00:42:13.270]  Was this the weapon of choice for a new kind of terrorist?
[00:42:13.610 --> 00:42:21.173]  When a five-year-old girl said she and a classmate should shoot each other with bubbles, the school called it a terrorist threat.
[00:42:21.593 --> 00:42:24.675]  AK-47s belong in the hands of soldiers, not in the hands of criminals.
[00:42:25.595 --> 00:42:29.577]  You know, the right to bear arms is because that's the last form of defense against tyranny.
[00:42:30.057 --> 00:42:32.058]  Lay down your arms, you damned rebels!
[00:42:33.783 --> 00:42:37.626]  But we don't need the ability to arm ourselves against the army or the police.
[00:42:37.926 --> 00:42:39.727]  What kind of a situation in the U.S.
[00:42:39.767 --> 00:42:40.748]  would you see that happening?
[00:42:40.808 --> 00:42:45.611]  I mean, we've got a lot of constitutionalists and a lot of people that stockpile weapons.
[00:42:45.932 --> 00:42:50.555]  The clergy would help the government with potentially their biggest problem, us.
[00:42:50.935 --> 00:42:57.940]  To say we're not turning our guns in and we're not running and we're not backing down, if you want to commentate!
[00:42:59.210 --> 00:43:03.713]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[00:43:04.234 --> 00:43:05.775]  It's Alex Jones!
[00:43:09.618 --> 00:43:22.547]  The British are coming!
[00:43:22.567 --> 00:43:23.608]  The British are coming!
[00:43:26.087 --> 00:43:42.874]  Now the ride of Paul Revere Set the nation on its ear And the shot at Lexington heard round the world When the British fired in the early dawn The war of independence had begun The die was cast, the rebel flag unfurled
[00:43:44.594 --> 00:44:09.799]  And on to Concord, marched the foe To seize the arsenal, there you know Wakin' folks, searchin' all around Till our militia stopped them in their tracks At the old North Bridge, we turned them back And chased those Redcoats back to Boston Town And the shudder around the world Was the start of a revolution The men and men were ready on the move
[00:44:20.259 --> 00:44:27.346]  It happened that they had planned, if the British was ever to come over here, that they'd put a light up in this high church steeple.
[00:44:28.107 --> 00:44:29.488]  And Paul went down there to look.
[00:44:30.269 --> 00:44:33.873]  And sure enough, there was the light, burning brighter and day.
[00:44:34.676 --> 00:44:37.778]  Well, Paul, he jumped on his old horse and he lit out.
[00:44:38.198 --> 00:44:41.060]  He didn't know where he was going, but he knew he had to go somewhere.
[00:44:41.461 --> 00:44:42.622]  Oh, I wish you could have seen it.
[00:44:42.922 --> 00:44:48.005]  That old horse with his ears laid back and his nostrils wide open, sucking in wind like a jet engine.
[00:44:48.285 --> 00:44:51.307]  Feet pounding on them cobblestones, striking off sparks.
[00:44:51.628 --> 00:44:54.990]  Paul holding on for dear life and a hollering at the top of his lungs.
[00:44:55.230 --> 00:44:56.851]  He says, the British is coming!
[00:44:56.891 --> 00:44:57.892]  The British is coming!
[00:44:58.172 --> 00:45:00.614]  Get your gun, we gonna have us a revolution!
[00:45:01.457 --> 00:45:05.438]  And them farmers come a-piling out of the hay like bees out of a beehive.
[00:45:06.039 --> 00:45:07.239]  Minute men, they's called.
[00:45:07.419 --> 00:45:08.179]  What's minute men?
[00:45:08.659 --> 00:45:09.160]  Minute men?
[00:45:09.760 --> 00:45:11.860]  They's fellas that had to be ready at a minute's notice.
[00:45:12.180 --> 00:45:19.403]  And when Paul comes screeching down the road that way, they grab their guns and head out behind the weeds and walls and trees and everywhere.
[00:45:20.583 --> 00:45:26.285]  And when the British come a-pranks and all dressed up in their red suits, they let them have it.
[00:45:27.846 --> 00:45:29.166]  It was a sight to see.
[00:45:30.836 --> 00:45:31.856]  And then it happened.
[00:45:32.416 --> 00:45:33.337]  They fired the gun!
[00:45:34.057 --> 00:45:35.117]  They fired the gun.
[00:45:36.057 --> 00:45:41.199]  And the shot was so loud, it was heard clear around the world.
[00:45:42.179 --> 00:45:43.499]  Oh, get out.
[00:45:43.539 --> 00:45:45.060]  It's a fact.
[00:45:45.740 --> 00:45:46.960]  That's the way this country started.
[00:46:16.909 --> 00:46:20.414]  Al Capone owed $150,000 in back taxes to the IRS and he went to prison.
[00:46:20.614 --> 00:46:25.540]  Al Sharpton, he owes $4.5 million and he goes to dinner at the White House.
[00:46:37.978 --> 00:46:38.980]  Brain Force is here.
[00:46:39.520 --> 00:46:41.804]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:46:42.084 --> 00:46:49.935]  You've probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of Brain Force.
[00:46:50.714 --> 00:46:54.295]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable, right?
[00:46:54.335 --> 00:46:56.675]  You're gonna crash, you're gonna feel really bad afterwards.
[00:46:57.035 --> 00:47:00.576]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[00:47:00.616 --> 00:47:03.757]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[00:47:04.257 --> 00:47:09.058]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[00:47:09.598 --> 00:47:11.458]  For example, the L-theanine inside of it.
[00:47:11.818 --> 00:47:16.239]  That is activated by the different compounds in the Yerba Mate that we put inside of it as well.
[00:47:16.419 --> 00:47:18.440]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[00:47:19.060 --> 00:47:20.520]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.
[00:47:20.680 --> 00:47:20.920]  Exactly.
[00:47:20.960 --> 00:47:24.762]  It's kind of like a car will run on one form of junky gas, but it runs really good on what it's designed for.
[00:47:25.262 --> 00:47:33.306]  You will find Brain Force, Survival Shield X2, and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:47:38.197 --> 00:47:43.202]  Introducing Secret 12, the new InfoWars Life vitamin B12 formulation.
[00:47:43.443 --> 00:47:49.549]  Most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic, and cannot be properly absorbed by the body.
[00:47:49.749 --> 00:47:56.717]  That's why for real results, so many are having to turn to painful B12 injections, which are known to have higher absorption rates.
[00:47:57.057 --> 00:48:07.003]  Now, InfoWarsLife.com is excited to announce that we can bring you our most bioactive, powerful form of B12 that has been developed with our exclusive, perfected process.
[00:48:07.563 --> 00:48:13.486]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimedical-grade, bioavailable, coenzyme forms of B12.
[00:48:13.726 --> 00:48:16.408]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections.
[00:48:17.188 --> 00:48:17.569]  We're good.
[00:48:41.104 --> 00:48:51.531]  We've seen celebrities like Brad Pitt, Johnny Depp, the basketball player Colin Malone, all come out and say that they support the Second Amendment, even though it's a very taboo thing to do in Hollywood right now.
[00:48:51.891 --> 00:49:04.079]  Because every time you see an interview with somebody saying how bad guns are, even though these people, the real famous ones, they live with armed security or they lived out in some secluded area, you know, have patrols coming and saving them.
[00:49:04.380 --> 00:49:09.123]  They go to these events and have security all around, but not for the average American citizen.
[00:49:09.163 --> 00:49:10.844]  So you need a means to protect yourself.
[00:49:11.324 --> 00:49:14.566]  And now when you see these interviews, they say, we need to ban this, we need to ban that.
[00:49:14.886 --> 00:49:20.189]  And the actor Kurt Russell has come out and said, banning everything is not going to limit terrorism.
[00:49:20.529 --> 00:49:22.810]  Because yes, you can commit a crime with a firearm.
[00:49:23.111 --> 00:49:26.192]  You can also make a homemade bomb with stuff that you buy at a Home Depot.
[00:49:26.513 --> 00:49:28.594]  You can drown somebody in four inches of bathwater.
[00:49:28.874 --> 00:49:33.356]  You can drive on the sidewalk and hit 37 people like just happened in the city of Las Vegas.
[00:49:33.376 --> 00:49:35.698]  So banning everything is not the answer.
[00:49:36.078 --> 00:49:39.800]  So now we go to Alex Jones, who has more on Kurt Russell's latest statement.
[00:49:41.411 --> 00:49:44.952]  Here's a story that is going up on Infowars.com in the next five minutes.
[00:49:44.992 --> 00:49:47.813]  They're in there proofreading it right now, but I said, this is so important.
[00:49:48.093 --> 00:49:57.235]  The Daily Beast reported on, of course, Kurt Russell going on TV shows, and they keep asking him, what's this about guns?
[00:49:57.535 --> 00:49:58.516]  And he keeps defending it.
[00:49:58.556 --> 00:50:00.256]  Now he goes, look, I'm a hardcore libertarian.
[00:50:00.796 --> 00:50:01.357]  Watch out.
[00:50:01.457 --> 00:50:02.497]  I don't want to go all the way here.
[00:50:02.777 --> 00:50:05.738]  Hollywood's full of fake conservatives and liberals who aren't patriots.
[00:50:05.878 --> 00:50:07.038]  I believe in the founding fathers.
[00:50:07.438 --> 00:50:07.818]  I believe in 1776.
[00:50:08.018 --> 00:50:09.679]  I mean, I've been told he's a listener.
[00:50:10.259 --> 00:50:13.021]  He doesn't like to get political, but we are reaching out to him.
[00:50:13.041 --> 00:50:22.149]  And again, I was told by a director here in town years ago that, well, it's Rick Linklater, came on the show and talked about Bruce Willis being awake.
[00:50:22.410 --> 00:50:27.994]  And then a few months later, he was in Vanity Fair about the New World Order, Kennedy being killed, and that I woke up Bruce Willis.
[00:50:28.034 --> 00:50:30.456]  And again, I'm not bragging about this.
[00:50:30.496 --> 00:50:31.557]  That interview's on record.
[00:50:32.458 --> 00:50:48.410]  It shows the power of this little show because they were making, um, I guess it was eight, nine years ago, they were making, um, the big, uh, film here in town with Robert Rodriguez, uh, that had him in it.
[00:50:48.430 --> 00:50:52.834]  Uh, what's the one where they're in New York City and it's like Gotham, Sin City, Sin City.
[00:50:52.874 --> 00:51:01.120]  And then he was also doing some work with Linkletter and literally heard my radio show, tuned in, got the films and woke up just being here in town a month.
[00:51:02.020 --> 00:51:08.322]  So that shows he went from being a Republican, he said this at Vanity Fair, I used to be a Republican, now I see they're all controlled by the same people.
[00:51:08.502 --> 00:51:10.463]  The people that killed Kennedy run America today.
[00:51:10.643 --> 00:51:11.663]  There's been a coup since then.
[00:51:12.223 --> 00:51:13.504]  So I never reached out to Willis.
[00:51:13.544 --> 00:51:14.644]  We are reaching out to him now.
[00:51:14.704 --> 00:51:17.525]  I don't expect him to come on because these people get threatened and intimidated.
[00:51:18.465 --> 00:51:22.827]  Then I was told that, oh, Kurt Russell's in town too, and you know, he likes your show.
[00:51:23.888 --> 00:51:29.170]  And again, he was already a libertarian, I was even told then, it's just that this show accelerated his awakening.
[00:51:29.610 --> 00:51:34.592]  And so I'm not bragging when Jeff Bridges calls me and says he's a huge fan of the show and listens all the time.
[00:51:35.313 --> 00:51:37.854]  I'm not on a power trip about Alex Jones.
[00:51:37.994 --> 00:51:47.598]  You need to know this signifies, just because I'm a public figure, so they're able to reach out to me or I get these pings, this info, like Viggo Mortensen.
[00:51:48.490 --> 00:51:53.333]  I was at a media event, saw an InfoWars flag on a mic, said, hey, I like Alex Jones, I'll come on.
[00:51:53.953 --> 00:51:54.494]  Here's my number.
[00:51:54.994 --> 00:51:56.435]  Came on, listens every week.
[00:51:56.855 --> 00:52:00.477]  And that's Viggo Mortensen, super ultra-liberal, but a real liberal.
[00:52:00.998 --> 00:52:02.899]  Somebody that's actually educated and informed.
[00:52:04.100 --> 00:52:07.202]  And you can disagree with us on some issues.
[00:52:07.222 --> 00:52:17.610]  But people like John Cusack, I mean, he is a hardcore Democrat, but he came out against Obama because of what Obama did with the NSA and with wars and other things.
[00:52:17.670 --> 00:52:20.132]  All we ask is you have integrity as a liberal or a conservative.
[00:52:20.152 --> 00:52:20.552]  Exactly.
[00:52:20.613 --> 00:52:22.594]  When Republicans do bad stuff, we go after them.
[00:52:22.654 --> 00:52:23.795]  I'm not a Republican, I'm a libertarian.
[00:52:24.035 --> 00:52:29.500]  But that's historically more allied with Republicans because of guns and things like that and lower taxes.
[00:52:30.220 --> 00:52:39.266]  But there is a takeover of the Republican Party happening by the Realty Party movement, not the one they tried to co-opt, fragments of it, and they admit that's the main threat.
[00:52:39.526 --> 00:52:51.334]  So again, going over all this, I may have to go to the next segment because I'm, you know, ranting off into other subjects, this huge awakening is happening, and now Kurt Russell's not backing down, he's doubling down, saying, I'm a hardcore libertarian,
[00:52:52.723 --> 00:52:54.664]  I'm sick of the left-right system.
[00:52:55.004 --> 00:52:57.765]  You know, we need to get back to our original roots.
[00:52:57.785 --> 00:52:57.765]  1776.
[00:52:58.105 --> 00:53:00.986]  The article is going live as we speak at InfoWars.com.
[00:53:01.026 --> 00:53:02.686]  You need to hit refresh on that.
[00:53:02.726 --> 00:53:05.407]  We have links to the video and audio of where he says it.
[00:53:05.547 --> 00:53:07.908]  That's great, because you listen to that whole interview.
[00:53:07.928 --> 00:53:16.051]  He's trying to plug the film, Hateful Eight, that's coming out, and he's got an interview with a guy, and the guy keeps coming after him about guns and gun culture and gun control, and he keeps saying,
[00:53:16.653 --> 00:53:17.634]  I'm here to talk about a movie.
[00:53:17.654 --> 00:53:18.415]  This is about art.
[00:53:18.455 --> 00:53:19.657]  I don't want to talk about politics.
[00:53:19.697 --> 00:53:23.882]  But the guy keeps on, and after a while, when you hear that interview, he just loses it.
[00:53:23.942 --> 00:53:31.671]  So now what's happened, instead of him not wanting to be public, being prodded, he's now gone on The View, and now other shows, and is getting more hardcore.
[00:53:31.952 --> 00:53:34.895]  That's the new video and audio at InfoWars.com.
[00:53:34.935 --> 00:53:35.816]  Now continuing here.
[00:53:36.417 --> 00:53:39.639]  They're going to counter-strike against us because this big awakening is happening.
[00:53:39.979 --> 00:53:42.260]  Congress has a 9% approval rating, three years running.
[00:53:42.821 --> 00:53:46.823]  People know college is a fraud now because there are no jobs or infrastructure for it.
[00:53:46.863 --> 00:53:48.244]  It's more of an indoctrination center.
[00:53:48.564 --> 00:53:51.686]  The system is tripling and quadrupling down on oppression.
[00:53:51.886 --> 00:53:55.208]  And the harder they squeeze, like a beach ball under the water, the more it's coming up.
[00:53:55.468 --> 00:53:59.830]  These are historical paradigms that we are extremely well aware of.
[00:54:00.210 --> 00:54:00.971]  Now continuing,
[00:54:02.532 --> 00:54:04.092]  What is their counter-strike going to be?
[00:54:04.693 --> 00:54:10.214]  It's going to be social shunning, like they did in Nazi Germany from 1933 until about 1939.
[00:54:10.834 --> 00:54:22.058]  Hitler didn't start rounding up his political opposition, whether they were conservative, liberal, it didn't matter, whether they were Jewish, communist, German, high command, until 1939.
[00:54:23.038 --> 00:54:24.400]  At first, it was demonization.
[00:54:24.420 --> 00:54:26.081]  At first, don't give you licenses.
[00:54:26.422 --> 00:54:28.063]  At first, it's not let you do business.
[00:54:28.384 --> 00:54:32.828]  At first, it's telling people don't do business with them or you'll be shunned.
[00:54:32.888 --> 00:54:35.531]  Then, by 37, 38, they start knocking the windows out.
[00:54:35.952 --> 00:54:37.693]  Then they start burning people's businesses down.
[00:54:37.733 --> 00:54:39.495]  Then they say, you go to this ghetto,
[00:54:40.461 --> 00:54:58.567]  And you live there, to all these different political groups, and then they start arresting you and selectively going after folks, breaking down the communities, getting people to tattletale on each other, setting up controllers like George Soros and others who would manage ghettos, and then make the Jews and others think they were on their side, then feed on them.
[00:54:58.767 --> 00:55:06.430]  That's what the ADL, Southern Poverty Law Center, all these groups are literally the children of the people that were the master Judas coats to feed on those groups.
[00:55:06.770 --> 00:55:07.690]  That's a microcosm.
[00:55:08.030 --> 00:55:09.331]  The Soviets do the same thing.
[00:55:09.371 --> 00:55:15.533]  They invented the term back in the 30s, a political correct, or correct political speech, is what it translates out of.
[00:55:15.774 --> 00:55:25.138]  They had commissars, political officers, thought police, who would go around pushing this stuff with the NKVD and other groups.
[00:55:25.438 --> 00:55:33.942]  But they didn't have to enforce it themselves because there were throngs of people that would fawn to the black uniforms, the black boots, all of it, and want to prove
[00:55:35.041 --> 00:55:35.761]  They're worthiness.
[00:55:35.801 --> 00:55:53.310]  So domestically they're coming in with a strong cities UN initiative that actually in DC and LA and Chicago are building UN substations, UN embassies that will nexus with police and others to make sure the police and local governments are behaving correctly.
[00:55:53.590 --> 00:55:54.711]  Now, why do they want the local police?
[00:55:55.071 --> 00:55:58.635]  Schwarzenegger heads up the munialization program of the UN.
[00:55:58.675 --> 00:56:04.820]  They can't get the states to go along with carbon taxes, or the feds to pass it, so Obama does it by executive at the top illegally.
[00:56:05.301 --> 00:56:13.629]  They come into the cities, fly these mayors and people around, literally to the finest $5,000 a night hotels, jet copters, hookers.
[00:56:13.889 --> 00:56:16.892]  They don't call them that, it's just, here's your, I mean, folks, I've talked to them, it's come out in the news.
[00:56:18.098 --> 00:56:20.140]  They go, your city can get diplomatic immunity.
[00:56:20.180 --> 00:56:24.245]  You can get a UN card and go to these UN junkets around the world and have immunity.
[00:56:24.725 --> 00:56:26.668]  So this is new forms of royalty.
[00:56:26.968 --> 00:56:28.570]  So they're setting up the new forms of royalty.
[00:56:28.590 --> 00:56:33.095]  They're going to then come in with these commissions, these truth and reconciliation commissions.
[00:56:33.115 --> 00:56:34.796]  That's what all the demonization of police is about.
[00:56:34.816 --> 00:56:37.640]  A lot of it legitimate, but the end is evil.
[00:56:38.120 --> 00:56:50.566]  To then globalize them and if they get certified by the UN, if they follow and become political police and go after people's speech and guns and the rest of it, the UN will give them political cover and sucker.
[00:56:51.326 --> 00:56:52.407]  Aiding and abetting, a sucker.
[00:56:52.807 --> 00:56:54.168]  So, this is the system.
[00:56:54.188 --> 00:57:02.672]  You already see the UN at the border saying, you know, we're going to sue Arizona, we're going to sue Arpaio, and they are now, because you're arresting people, you're following the law.
[00:57:02.932 --> 00:57:04.694]  If somebody doesn't have ID and is drunk driving.
[00:57:05.254 --> 00:57:08.096]  I mean, in Travis County and other cities, they are above the law, illegals.
[00:57:08.377 --> 00:57:12.460]  And we're not against the illegals, it just shows how they're a protected group because it's part of a program.
[00:57:12.840 --> 00:57:23.790]  Now continuing, there's hundreds of ways they're going to counter-strike us, but make no mistake, they legalized the CIA operating domestically, it was already happening, with quote, deception last year.
[00:57:23.810 --> 00:57:28.434]  That was in the Washington Post, that was in Foreign Affairs, we played the Pentagon press releases.
[00:57:30.197 --> 00:57:32.278]  Literally saying, don't run, we're your friends.
[00:57:32.459 --> 00:57:35.140]  Quote, the Army Undersecretary of Defense.
[00:57:35.501 --> 00:57:38.563]  You can watch our video saying, we're sorry we've lied to you.
[00:57:39.003 --> 00:57:42.745]  Now we're going to be involved in every town and city interfacing with you with the truth.
[00:57:43.326 --> 00:57:50.450]  And so they've embedded all these psyops people that overthrow other countries and controlled Iraq and overthrew Ukraine.
[00:57:50.851 --> 00:57:52.192]  They are now embedded.
[00:57:53.112 --> 00:57:54.893]  And people are getting off on it.
[00:57:55.053 --> 00:57:59.276]  People are walking up to Hollywood stars saying, watch it, I'm CIA flashing badges.
[00:57:59.696 --> 00:58:04.639]  And they're literally just been in it six months, they're not even CIA, they're just adjunct commissars.
[00:58:05.179 --> 00:58:06.940]  Literal... Let me just give you more data.
[00:58:06.980 --> 00:58:09.222]  Let me give you more data.
[00:58:09.442 --> 00:58:12.944]  Just remember three months ago, it was mainstream billed newspaper.
[00:58:13.004 --> 00:58:14.785]  People didn't believe it when Infowars reported on it.
[00:58:15.205 --> 00:58:17.927]  They're actually hiring at Facebook in Germany.
[00:58:18.527 --> 00:58:21.609]  Former high-level Stasi, the worst police state ever.
[00:58:23.797 --> 00:58:25.037]  Well, that's it for our show tonight.
[00:58:25.057 --> 00:58:31.679]  We definitely do wish you and your family a Merry Christmas and encourage you to stop by PrisonPlanet.TV, get yourself a free trial.

[00:58:37.521 --> 00:58:42.422]  I'm Jakari Jackson from the Info Wars Command Center, and we'll see you again this holiday season.
[00:58:48.826 --> 00:58:49.967]  Knockout is back.
[00:58:50.307 --> 00:59:01.413]  If you want a product that has 10 known ingredients that naturally get your body to relax, your brain to relax, so you get deep restful sleep, Knockout's it.
[00:59:01.813 --> 00:59:03.534]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:59:04.014 --> 00:59:13.159]  L-theanine, hops flower extract, lemon balm extract, valerian root extract, chamomile flower extract, L-tryptophan extract, melatonin, and more.
[00:59:13.539 --> 00:59:15.320]  All organic, all the natural sources.
[00:59:15.880 --> 00:59:16.741]  It's the same price
[00:59:17.481 --> 00:59:23.364]  As leading brands of melatonin that are three milligrams a piece, it has three milligram, the standard recommended dose for an adult.
[00:59:23.904 --> 00:59:30.148]  It's got the GABA, so it would probably cost $50 to take all this as separate pills.
[00:59:30.648 --> 00:59:30.768]  It's $19.95.
[00:59:31.488 --> 00:59:33.830]  You take one or two of these,
[00:59:34.930 --> 00:59:38.213]  And it just is really clean restful sleep is what the reviews are.
[00:59:38.553 --> 00:59:42.476]  It's what I've experienced and it just synergistically puts everything in there.
