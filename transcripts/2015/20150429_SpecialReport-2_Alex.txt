[00:00:12.128 --> 00:00:22.957]  Evidence in crimes of violence, such as this bloody garment, is examined by an expert from the Hairs and Fibers Unit, another of several specialized units of the FBI laboratory.
[00:00:23.322 --> 00:00:35.030]  The National Academy of Sciences published a report calling into question numerous forensic sciences and calling for increased oversight and research into the growing issue of forensic sciences in 2009.
[00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:53.302]  Now, homicide convictions nationwide are being stayed due to a 2012 inquiry by the FBI that is reviewing almost 3,000 homicide cases from three decades ago that used what is being called junk science to determine the guilty parties using forensic analysis of hair samples.
[00:00:53.542 --> 00:01:08.218]  The FBI has acknowledged nearly every examiner in its elite forensic unit gave flawed testimony in almost all trials in which they offered evidence against criminal defendants in more than a two decade period before the year 2000.
[00:01:08.298 --> 00:01:13.003]  The faulty science led to 32 death sentences in a review of 342 cases.
[00:01:14.605 --> 00:01:24.311]  The FBI still has a backlog of 1,200 cases to review in order to see how many more innocent people may have been prosecuted by their junk science.
[00:01:24.831 --> 00:01:41.942]  The previously reported Q12 hair, Caucasian head hair exhibiting characteristics of apparent decomposition at the root end exhibited the same microscopic characteristics as the Caucasian head hairs from the hair mass.
[00:01:42.807 --> 00:01:48.791]  Accordingly, this hair and the hair mass are consistent with originating from the same source.
[00:01:49.632 --> 00:01:54.555]  However, it should be noted that hairs are not a means of positive identification.
[00:01:55.175 --> 00:02:00.899]  Mark Godsey, Director of Exoneration Advocacy Group, the Ohio Innocence Project, says,
[00:02:13.327 --> 00:02:19.369]  In 1978, 17-year-old Sante Tribble was convicted of murder of a Southeast Washington, D.C.
[00:02:19.429 --> 00:02:23.911]  taxi driver based on the testimony of two FBI forensic experts.
[00:02:24.471 --> 00:02:33.775]  Tribble served 28 years in prison based on expert evidence that turned out to be a dog's hair when examined by an independent analyst.
[00:02:34.275 --> 00:02:47.763]  With the ruling, Tribble became the second DC man this year and the third since 2009 to be exonerated after serving a lengthy prison term based on false hair matches by different examiners in the FBI laboratory.
[00:02:48.304 --> 00:02:56.409]  The findings do, as Senator Blumenthal said, constitute nothing less than an appalling and chilling indictment of the criminal justice system.
[00:02:56.869 --> 00:02:59.891]  Now the lab errors and false testimony have been discovered.
[00:03:00.172 --> 00:03:16.404]  The federal government and the 46 states, including Connecticut, in which convictions were obtained, at least in part with flawed testimony should, depending on whatever other evidence exists in each case, either agree to a new trial or ask to have the conviction vacated.
[00:03:16.704 --> 00:03:20.085]  Pop TV culture would have you believe that this science is legitimate.
[00:03:20.326 --> 00:03:25.488]  Entire shows hinging on the expert scientific evidence given by federal forensic analysts.
[00:03:25.728 --> 00:03:29.469]  A prime example of the use of propaganda to sway the public's perception.
[00:03:32.751 --> 00:03:37.973]  What has transpired at the FBI is nothing less than a complete breakdown of justice.
[00:03:38.433 --> 00:03:39.793]  John Bowne, Infowars.com
[00:03:48.186 --> 00:03:52.570]  Symbols are powerful, and the globalists have hijacked the symbols of America.
[00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:55.152]  They've turned them into their own symbols.
[00:03:55.472 --> 00:04:05.161]  Well, we are restoring the idea of the true republic, not the counterfeit globalist empire, by promoting the icon George Washington and others.
[00:04:05.501 --> 00:04:13.704]  That's why we're rolling out on a 100% made in America line of incredible pro-liberty apparel.
[00:04:13.904 --> 00:04:16.445]  We are re-popularizing liberty.
[00:04:16.865 --> 00:04:21.106]  We are helping fellow Americans rediscover what made this country great.
[00:04:21.467 --> 00:04:22.367]  We are the spirit of 1776.
[00:04:23.867 --> 00:04:26.148]  We are 1776 worldwide.
[00:04:26.208 --> 00:04:31.430]  We are all brothers and sisters in arms in the animating contest of liberty.
[00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:32.271]  We're good to go.
