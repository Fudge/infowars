[00:00:08.066 --> 00:00:14.689]  Carrie Mills is a retired Atlanta police officer with 30 years on the job, primarily in APD's drug unit.
[00:00:15.069 --> 00:00:18.431]  And she says no-knock warrants helped her close a lot of cases.
[00:00:18.811 --> 00:00:22.353]  If we knock and announce, all evidence is going to be destroyed.
[00:00:22.753 --> 00:00:32.658]  You've got to draw the line between your right as a citizen to privacy and a community's right to live in a crime-free environment.
[00:00:33.178 --> 00:00:34.339]  You can't have them both.
[00:00:35.623 --> 00:00:44.146]  Now, it was a police representative out of Georgia with pretty much a backwards paraphrase of the statement we know that those who sacrifice their liberty for security will inherit neither.
[00:00:44.386 --> 00:00:45.886]  Well, she's saying you can't have both.
[00:00:45.926 --> 00:00:49.287]  You have to choose, particularly when it comes to no-knock raids.
[00:00:49.748 --> 00:00:55.089]  Her justification, well, hey, if we announce our presence beforehand, the suspect can destroy evidence.
[00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:59.771]  Well, what if you don't announce your presence and somebody's life is destroyed during one of these raids?
[00:01:00.271 --> 00:01:01.992]  Such as the case of Baby Bobo.
[00:01:02.032 --> 00:01:03.252]  You guys have probably seen this.
[00:01:03.872 --> 00:01:14.597]  A child was injured when an officer threw a flashbang grenade into his crib, blew a hole into his chest, ripped apart his face, and now the family is facing about a million dollars in medical bill expenses.
[00:01:14.777 --> 00:01:16.237]  But that's not the only example.
[00:01:16.297 --> 00:01:21.339]  We saw in New Hampshire a violent DEA raid that left a grandmother with bullet wounds.
[00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.220]  They entered multiple facilities looking for multiple suspects.
[00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:28.722]  They were looking for the grandmother's children, and when they entered the residence, the grandmother
[00:01:29.082 --> 00:01:31.805]  But it's not always the suspects who catch the business end in these no-knock raids.
[00:01:31.845 --> 00:01:33.046]  How about if an officer gets shot?
[00:01:33.066 --> 00:01:33.967]  Such is the case in Oklahoma.
[00:01:33.987 --> 00:01:36.069]  He went looking for a suspected bomber.
[00:01:51.463 --> 00:01:54.045]  Entered the wrong residence and was shot multiple times.
[00:01:54.445 --> 00:01:57.227]  Luckily this officer was wearing a vest and lived to tell the tale.
[00:01:57.568 --> 00:01:59.089]  But not everybody is as fortunate.
[00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:00.810]  We saw the case in Killeen, Texas.
[00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:06.894]  An officer was climbing through a window during another no-knock raid and was shot in the face for his efforts.
[00:02:07.195 --> 00:02:09.636]  The suspect is being held for the murder of the officer.
[00:02:09.696 --> 00:02:10.597]  I don't think he should have been.
[00:02:10.937 --> 00:02:14.120]  He was protecting himself and his family like any good Texan would.
[00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:15.981]  And finally, we'll end with this.
[00:02:16.521 --> 00:02:20.164]  A murder charge dropped against a man who killed an officer during a no-knock raid.
[00:02:20.204 --> 00:02:21.185]  Another Texas case
[00:02:21.825 --> 00:02:24.046]  Officers, they come in at all hours of the night.
[00:02:24.286 --> 00:02:29.947]  The Texan arms himself and protects his family, not knowing who's inside of his home, opens fire on the officer, killing him.
[00:02:30.207 --> 00:02:35.048]  Luckily, the murder charge was dropped against this gentleman, but he is facing other charges.
[00:02:35.268 --> 00:02:41.669]  And in closing, I would say to any officer whose priority is preserving evidence, how about the priority of preserving life?
