[00:00:19.628 --> 00:00:21.649]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:21.749 --> 00:00:23.049]  I'm your host, Jakari Jackson.
[00:00:23.389 --> 00:00:27.210]  It is August 26, 2015, and here's a look at our top stories.
[00:00:36.033 --> 00:00:40.394]  There was a shooting at WDBJ Television in Virginia.
[00:00:42.034 --> 00:00:47.516]  Vester Flanagan was at the affiliate.
[00:00:48.831 --> 00:00:52.556]  Twitter account suspended after first-person video of shooting posted.
[00:00:53.176 --> 00:00:54.358]  We have played that.
[00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:59.604]  We have the graphic full video up on InfoWars.com.
[00:01:00.645 --> 00:01:04.831]  The cops now say suspect in the murder shot himself is in critical condition.
[00:01:04.871 --> 00:01:05.812]  First they thought he was dead.
[00:01:07.122 --> 00:01:09.084]  Uh, but he does supposedly have a light pulse.
[00:01:10.245 --> 00:01:25.638]  And, uh, he's a guy that worked his way into TV, uh, from the bottom, ended up being able to be a reporter, uh, ended up being able to, uh, at TV stations across the country, but continually had to leave those stations after he filed EEOC reports and lawsuits.
[00:02:00.365 --> 00:02:06.667]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[00:02:07.028 --> 00:02:08.508]  I believe our research is conclusive.
[00:02:08.528 --> 00:02:09.909]  This is the best iodine out there.
[00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:11.309]  And I know this for a fact.
[00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:16.611]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:02:16.731 --> 00:02:20.833]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of Survival Shield X2.
[00:02:21.213 --> 00:02:22.693]  I believe our research is conclusive.
[00:02:22.713 --> 00:02:24.054]  This is the best iodine out there.
[00:02:24.094 --> 00:02:26.215]  Take advantage of this at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:02:33.541 --> 00:02:49.187]  You know, I've worked here for about three years, and through Sandy Hook and the Boston bombing and some of the worst tragedies in recent American history, I can count on one hand the number of times that a story made me feel physically ill, and today was one of those stories.
[00:02:49.747 --> 00:03:07.814]  Where we saw a situation of reporters, and it's not because they were reporters, they could have been garbage collectors or dog catchers or anybody else, but people just out doing their jobs and they're approached by an individual who takes it upon themselves to shoot them, to shoot the two reporters and wound another person because, you know, whatever reason.
[00:03:07.834 --> 00:03:14.737]  You know, the guy brings up racial comments, but that doesn't give you the right to go out and kill two people, especially if you have beef with one person.
[00:03:14.797 --> 00:03:16.018]  Why did you kill the cameraman?
[00:03:16.638 --> 00:03:21.519]  But now we have the article, Suspected Gunman Fatally Shoots Self After Killing Journalist On Air.
[00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:36.842]  And this is Vester L. Flanagan II, the suspect in the slayings of two WDBJ-TV journalists, died at a hospital Wednesday afternoon after a self-inflicted gunshot wound, Franklin County, Virginia Sheriff Bill Overton told reporters.
[00:03:37.502 --> 00:03:45.604]  ABC News reported that it had received a fax containing a 23-page manifesto from someone named Bryce Williams, according to a tweet.
[00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:52.632]  They show Flanagan alleging that he had been the victim of bullying and discrimination because he was gay and black.
[00:03:53.312 --> 00:03:58.474]  Also that he was compelled to respond to Dylan Roof's massacre at a Charleston, South Carolina church.
[00:03:58.894 --> 00:04:08.299]  Now I can say from actually being in Charleston, South Carolina after that horrible shooting, and Roof is a name I was hoping I'd never have to repeat again, but this guy brought it up unfortunately.
[00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:16.806]  Nobody in that community that I met while I was there wanted any type of racial retaliation for the actions of Roof.
[00:04:16.846 --> 00:04:24.834]  Of course, they wanted him to be held responsible for his actions, but they didn't want some race war that the character of Roof was trying to instigate.
[00:04:25.234 --> 00:04:26.355]  Nobody wanted that.
[00:04:26.636 --> 00:04:28.638]  And also, you can go back and watch the interviews.
[00:04:29.178 --> 00:04:29.378]  Yeah.
[00:04:48.098 --> 00:04:48.819]  Yeah, I think so.
[00:05:04.033 --> 00:05:15.602]  More seasoned Caucasian woman while I was on the bridge and she said, you know, I'm just out here for the same reasons that everybody else holding hands with young black men because I want to see togetherness in this community.
[00:05:16.042 --> 00:05:22.508]  So it's very unfortunate that this character, this this Flanagan character decided to take it amongst himself to
[00:05:23.188 --> 00:05:24.049]  Go ahead and shoot people.
[00:05:44.127 --> 00:05:49.395]  He got in his car, he was fleeing around, eventually encountered police, he drove into a ditch.
[00:05:49.455 --> 00:05:54.984]  Thus is my understanding, when the police found him, he was dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.
[00:05:55.905 --> 00:05:58.890]  And we have some of the tweets, and we'll bring these up for our viewers here.
[00:05:59.651 --> 00:06:01.654]  And these are from the Bryce Williams account.
[00:06:02.014 --> 00:06:03.396]  And it says, I filmed the shooting.
[00:06:03.456 --> 00:06:04.237]  See Facebook.
[00:06:04.678 --> 00:06:09.244]  And that's when I first learned that there is a video alternative to the news coverage.
[00:06:09.304 --> 00:06:13.389]  I saw the news coverage report, the live coverage report earlier today.
[00:06:13.449 --> 00:06:16.132]  You know, people put it up on their YouTube channels or whatever.
[00:06:16.793 --> 00:06:21.456]  And that was horrifying enough, but then I was back there talking to our news producer, Rob Dew.
[00:06:21.496 --> 00:06:32.361]  He said there's another report that Flanagan put on his own Twitter, Facebook, whatever it was, that showed pretty much a first-person view, I guess somewhat reminiscent of a first-person video game.
[00:06:32.882 --> 00:06:35.343]  And it's rather difficult footage to watch.
[00:06:35.403 --> 00:06:41.947]  Actually, I haven't watched it, but we will show that to you later on in the broadcast in a report with Alex Jones for the people who want to see that.
[00:06:42.467 --> 00:06:44.068]  But also, we'll look at some more of these tweets.
[00:06:44.728 --> 00:06:47.752]  Adam went to HR on me after working with me one time.
[00:06:48.593 --> 00:06:51.697]  They hired her after that, I guess referring to the female reporter.
[00:06:52.438 --> 00:07:00.388]  And EEOC report filed, I guess that was for the racial discrimination or the homosexual discrimination that he said he received.
[00:07:00.408 --> 00:07:03.252]  And also, Allison made racist comments.
[00:07:04.218 --> 00:07:04.498]  I don't know.
[00:07:21.025 --> 00:07:30.878]  And it's very unsettling, unnerving to see how people have jumped on this bandwagon that before even the bodies were cold that they want to come out and blame the firearms.
[00:07:31.258 --> 00:07:35.904]  And to anybody who would say, you know, we have to blame the firearms, think of, what's the guy's name, Elliot Rodger.
[00:07:36.485 --> 00:07:40.888]  You guys recall him, he stabbed people, he ran people over with his vehicle, and he shot people.
[00:07:41.268 --> 00:07:42.629]  Nobody said, let's ban cars.
[00:07:42.929 --> 00:07:44.230]  Nobody said, let's ban knives.
[00:07:44.250 --> 00:07:45.491]  It was like, let's ban the guns.
[00:07:45.791 --> 00:07:47.172]  And now people are doing this.
[00:07:47.572 --> 00:07:51.475]  We'll go over some of the things here that Watson has in the article.
[00:07:52.116 --> 00:08:05.925]  And he has an extraordinary series of tweets where Flanagan posted himself shooting Ward and Parker, which we already talked about, and talking about his issues with Parker, saying after racial comments that they hired her after something like that.
[00:08:06.505 --> 00:08:10.087]  And Flanagan also sued NBC Network for racism.
[00:08:10.487 --> 00:08:14.950]  So Flanagan was a guy who was released from the company about two years ago.
[00:08:14.970 --> 00:08:17.231]  I believe the news director came out and said that.
[00:08:17.692 --> 00:08:25.957]  He remained in the area and just I guess the hatred festered in him for quite a while and he decided to go out and kill two people.
[00:08:27.397 --> 00:08:29.459]  It's very hard but now we see politicians
[00:08:30.279 --> 00:08:33.200]  They're coming out saying, we have to ban the guns, we have to do this, we have to do that.
[00:08:33.300 --> 00:08:38.881]  And like, let's just have a moment of silence and mourning for the people who have been affected by this tragedy.
[00:08:39.181 --> 00:08:47.603]  Because yes, bad stuff does happen, but it's not my responsibility as a responsible gun owner who has a gun safe in my one bedroom apartment that I share with my dog.
[00:08:48.143 --> 00:08:51.424]  It's not my fault that these people were killed in these tragedies.
[00:08:51.944 --> 00:08:54.304]  And it's just like, I meet people and I have this debate with them.
[00:08:55.224 --> 00:08:57.425]  If you can really call it a debate, I think it's a rather
[00:08:58.592 --> 00:08:59.552]  We're good to go.
[00:09:19.801 --> 00:09:28.146]  And I say, yes, as a confident American citizen, adult, you can understand that to blame you for all tragedies of some people is ridiculous.
[00:09:28.166 --> 00:09:29.107]  So how's it my fault?
[00:09:29.407 --> 00:09:30.508]  How's it Alex Jones' fault?
[00:09:30.528 --> 00:09:35.250]  How's it the NRA's, Gun Owners of America, or anybody else's fault that these tragedies happen?
[00:09:35.290 --> 00:09:39.153]  Bad stuff happens, but you know, the flip side of that, we have concealed carry.
[00:09:39.173 --> 00:09:40.994]  We have means to protect ourselves.
[00:09:41.354 --> 00:09:44.037]  And that's not, you know, I'm not blaming the victims or anybody else.
[00:09:44.358 --> 00:09:46.360]  I'm not saying they should have had a gun to protect themselves.
[00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:52.287]  I just want to live in a world where they have the option to carry a firearm to protect themselves if they deem it necessary.
[00:09:52.667 --> 00:09:54.990]  So we're going to go on to the special report from Alex Jones.
[00:09:55.010 --> 00:09:59.916]  He filed earlier today on the Alex Jones Show and stay tuned after that for more special reports.
[00:10:01.573 --> 00:10:03.493]  It's Wednesday, the 26th day of August, 2015.
[00:10:04.074 --> 00:10:14.136]  Alex Jones here reporting on the tragic shooting death live on television of a reporter and the cameraman in Virginia.
[00:10:14.736 --> 00:10:18.577]  This story is now the biggest story in the world.
[00:10:18.717 --> 00:10:26.559]  I've been called by the BBC, I've been called by Al Jazeera, I've been called by ABC here in the United States wanting
[00:10:27.299 --> 00:10:33.702]  Me to respond because I'm a pro-gun advocate and so somehow I'm guilty for what's happened.
[00:10:34.522 --> 00:10:37.443]  That's like saying that if the U.S.
[00:10:37.503 --> 00:10:50.609]  military has a destroyer and someone in history with a destroyer used that destroyer to sink an innocent ship, that everyone on board the ship currently, a separate ship, is guilty.
[00:10:51.589 --> 00:10:53.930]  Psychopaths kill people.
[00:10:54.330 --> 00:10:55.971]  Guns don't kill people.
[00:10:57.230 --> 00:10:59.811]  There are so many facets to this.
[00:11:00.351 --> 00:11:03.312]  We'll be breaking it down today on the live radio show 11 a.m.
[00:11:03.432 --> 00:11:03.932]  to 2 p.m.
[00:11:04.172 --> 00:11:06.192]  at Infowars.com forward slash show.
[00:11:07.173 --> 00:11:09.013]  But this is the main issue.
[00:11:09.433 --> 00:11:20.276]  The media is going to turn this into an absolute spectacle and a call to restrict the Second Amendment, whether it's CNN, whether it's MSNBC or even Fox News.
[00:11:21.567 --> 00:11:35.290]  That is what is now being pushed right as Obama promises a bunch of executive action to restrict the Second Amendment even of Social Security recipients using VA algorithms applied by the FBI.
[00:11:36.131 --> 00:11:48.814]  So a massive anti-gun move is being launched and you've got this individual who looks like he's in a first-person shoot-em-up video game like Doom or Call of Duty.
[00:11:49.944 --> 00:12:01.111]  Up front with the gun in his hand, with his phone, recording the video of when he shoots the poor reporter and the cameraman.
[00:12:01.431 --> 00:12:03.312]  This is unprecedented.
[00:12:03.612 --> 00:12:09.636]  Now, there's tons of video of ISIS, funded by our government and others, openly killing hundreds of thousands of people.
[00:12:10.416 --> 00:12:14.124]  There's all sorts of footage of Saudi Arabia chopping people's heads off.
[00:12:14.504 --> 00:12:21.999]  You don't see that getting played because they don't want to get you upset about our ally ISIS and our ally Saudi Arabia.
[00:12:23.015 --> 00:12:24.075]  So let's go through the points.
[00:12:24.616 --> 00:12:47.506]  This will now be a giant distraction from everything else that's happening in the country, in the world, and the global stock market meltdowns, and the buildup for war with Russia, and the crises in China, and ISIS spreading into other countries, and all these wars, and everything that's intensifying, and Obama disappearing the borders, and 10,000 anchor babies coming in, every single
[00:12:48.326 --> 00:12:49.047]  We're good to go.
[00:13:16.528 --> 00:13:31.053]  Of the fact that overall mass shootings are flat in the last decade and overall down the last 20 years and crime using guns is down more than 50% since 1992 in the Justice Department's own numbers.
[00:13:32.173 --> 00:13:40.456]  So we have cinematically shot footage and we have the typically creepy killer that's gone postal.
[00:13:41.829 --> 00:13:49.192]  Now being used as a pretext to apply guilt to all Americans that choose to not be victims and defend themselves.
[00:13:49.972 --> 00:14:02.956]  The truth is, depending on the statistics you look at, guns are used over 40 times, upwards to 100 times, more often to stop crime and to defend life than they're used to take it in crime.
[00:14:03.997 --> 00:14:06.998]  And then of course there's the shooter, Vester Flanagan.
[00:14:07.438 --> 00:14:10.259]  A big problem the leftist media is going to have.
[00:14:10.694 --> 00:14:23.418]  While they're trying to scapegoat the Second Amendment, is that Mr. Flanagan has been tweeting that he did this as a courageous act against racist white people that he had heard make unsensitive remarks.
[00:14:24.279 --> 00:14:38.624]  I mean, after all, we've seen the thousands of tweets saying the only good white person is a dead white person, and MSNBC and CNN have been going along with the narrative saying that this entire Soros White House funded movement is a good thing.
[00:14:39.451 --> 00:14:43.195]  We do have some cultural problems in this country and a history of violence.
[00:14:43.876 --> 00:14:47.320]  And that's even more of a reason for us to have a right to defend ourselves.
[00:14:48.311 --> 00:14:50.973]  Good people with guns is the answer to bad people with guns.
[00:14:51.454 --> 00:14:57.558]  We will continue to track this story as it unfolds on the live radio show today at InfoWars.com.
[00:14:57.999 --> 00:15:10.249]  Our hearts and prayers do go out to the two people that were tragically killed in Virginia, but it also goes out to the 300,000 people killed in Syria and Libya and other areas by radical jihadis funded by our own government.
[00:15:10.709 --> 00:15:12.611]  Ladies and gentlemen, make no mistake.
[00:15:13.211 --> 00:15:15.212]  There is an assault on the Second Amendment.
[00:15:15.292 --> 00:15:18.535]  This signals the next wave, the rollout.
[00:15:19.335 --> 00:15:21.497]  They always say there can't be one more mass shooting.
[00:15:21.537 --> 00:15:23.298]  You know, you gun owners are at fault.
[00:15:23.318 --> 00:15:25.399]  It's like saying there can't be one more car accident.
[00:15:25.579 --> 00:15:26.560]  Let's ban the cars.
[00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:27.981]  People use cars.
[00:15:28.021 --> 00:15:29.042]  They use baseball bats.
[00:15:29.302 --> 00:15:31.243]  They use steel rods to kill people.
[00:15:31.643 --> 00:15:34.485]  You cannot blame the instrument, the tool.
[00:15:34.685 --> 00:15:35.746]  You blame the individual.
[00:15:36.086 --> 00:15:42.911]  This is a fight between common sense and the forces of tyranny that want to be the only ones with the guns so they can fully enslave us.
[00:15:43.251 --> 00:15:45.513]  And the answer to their tyranny is 1776.
[00:15:47.875 --> 00:15:58.645]  Unfortunately, you've grown up hearing voices that incessantly warn of government as nothing more than some separate sinister entity that's at the root of all our problems.
[00:15:58.985 --> 00:16:01.167]  It's time to stop submitting to this tyranny!
[00:16:01.348 --> 00:16:03.430]  It's time to realize that we're being enslaved!
[00:16:04.110 --> 00:16:06.853]  Some of these same voices also do their best to gum up the works.
[00:16:08.387 --> 00:16:11.068]  They'll warn that tyranny is always lurking just around the corner.
[00:16:11.268 --> 00:16:14.849]  Tyranny, with a capital T. You should reject these voices.
[00:16:15.629 --> 00:16:34.634]  Everything that's been done, with torture, rendition, the NDAA, the Patriot Acts 1 and 2, from day one, was focused on the American people, period.
[00:16:36.055 --> 00:16:36.475]  That's it.
[00:16:37.637 --> 00:16:46.159]  It's always been about erasing the Bill of Rights and Constitution and rolling out NSA spying publicly, saying it's for Al Qaeda.
[00:16:46.579 --> 00:16:50.660]  Rolling out torture, saying it's for Al Qaeda, but it's really for the general public.
[00:16:51.020 --> 00:16:59.602]  Rolling out total control and the end of any underground free market systems in the name of fighting Al Qaeda, but really shutting down any type of free commerce.
[00:17:00.062 --> 00:17:02.023]  This is all about converting us.
[00:17:02.583 --> 00:17:08.069]  From a free society to a tyranny with a capital T.
[00:17:16.348 --> 00:17:31.737]  You know, with all this talk lately about gun control, it occurred to me that I have yet to see a single politician who can explain to me how they plan to take guns away from the criminal thugs who are out there on the streets right now.
[00:17:32.398 --> 00:17:38.842]  Oh sure, you'll hear plenty of talk about how they plan to take guns away from us, us law-abiding citizens.
[00:17:39.522 --> 00:17:47.985]  But if you take guns away from all of us legal gun owners, then the only people that will have guns will be the bad guys.
[00:17:48.646 --> 00:17:49.866]  In fact, I'm curious.
[00:17:50.266 --> 00:17:52.027]  I want to see a show of hands right now.
[00:17:52.387 --> 00:17:54.468]  All those for gun control, raise your hands.
[00:17:55.028 --> 00:17:57.849]  Alright, there's one, two, three, four.
[00:17:58.790 --> 00:17:59.270]  Anyone else?
[00:18:01.311 --> 00:18:02.651]  Ah, see there, that figures.
[00:18:03.192 --> 00:18:04.532]  All the usual suspects.
[00:18:05.713 --> 00:18:06.273]  Any questions?
[00:18:16.258 --> 00:18:17.259]  Brain Force is here.
[00:18:17.599 --> 00:18:19.880]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:28.004]  You've probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of Brain Force.
[00:18:28.692 --> 00:18:33.514]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[00:18:34.034 --> 00:18:35.895]  For example, the L-theanine inside of it.
[00:18:36.235 --> 00:18:40.677]  That is activated by the different compounds in the Yerba Mate that we put inside of it as well.
[00:18:40.837 --> 00:18:42.897]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[00:18:43.498 --> 00:18:44.998]  This is what you're actually designed to run on?
[00:18:45.118 --> 00:18:45.358]  Exactly.
[00:18:45.378 --> 00:18:49.180]  It's kind of like a car will run on one form of junky gas, but it runs really good on what it's designed for.
[00:18:49.704 --> 00:18:57.129]  And that's the principle of InfoWarsLife as far as I understand that you've always had is that it's not about synthetic chemicals and forcing actions.
[00:18:57.329 --> 00:19:05.474]  It's about letting your body do its own thing and giving your body the tools it needs to create these different compounds that are super valuable and super beneficial.
[00:19:05.774 --> 00:19:12.078]  You will find BrainForce and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:19:16.189 --> 00:19:19.531]  I wanted to bring Weldon Henson in here briefly, because we have a great sponsor.
[00:19:19.871 --> 00:19:22.573]  Boy, I've sure been enjoying the firearms that I've gotten from them.
[00:19:23.034 --> 00:19:24.775]  HDFirearms.com.
[00:19:25.015 --> 00:19:26.256]  That's Head Down Firearms.
[00:19:26.516 --> 00:19:30.338]  They have super high quality .223s, .308, you name it.
[00:19:30.519 --> 00:19:34.421]  It's called .556, technically, in the .223, that are guns that would be $3,000 or $1,500.
[00:19:34.721 --> 00:19:35.622]  Guns that would be $1,500 or $900.
[00:19:40.265 --> 00:19:48.051]  Well, the important thing to remember is that if you're not in the market to buy a brand new rifle, you have an AR-15, you have an AR-10 platform 308 rifle.
[00:19:48.331 --> 00:19:50.033]  They've got everything you need to upgrade it.
[00:19:50.193 --> 00:19:53.716]  Buy a new part, buy a new trigger, buy a new muzzle brake, buy a new handrail.
[00:19:54.456 --> 00:19:59.080]  It's all an upgrade for your rifle because these are all superior, top-of-the-line quality products made in America.
[00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:01.801]  Tell folks about their low-profile series.
[00:20:01.921 --> 00:20:03.362]  Well, this is an important thing to have.
[00:20:03.522 --> 00:20:04.902]  This is untraceable.
[00:20:05.362 --> 00:20:07.083]  Anybody can get this kit right here.
[00:20:07.143 --> 00:20:10.384]  You don't have to go through a federal firearms license place.
[00:20:11.185 --> 00:20:12.385]  You can have it shipped right to your house.
[00:20:12.405 --> 00:20:14.086]  This is what the traders have been trying to shut down?
[00:20:14.246 --> 00:20:14.706]  Absolutely.
[00:20:14.826 --> 00:20:20.928]  So you basically have everything you need besides a lower receiver, because that's what's traceable, that's what's serialized, and that's what the federal government's after.
[00:20:22.589 --> 00:20:23.510]  You can get this right here.
[00:20:23.750 --> 00:20:25.471]  Get your own lower receiver any way you want.
[00:20:25.491 --> 00:20:26.511]  There's different programs.
[00:20:26.531 --> 00:20:31.374]  All you gotta do is your own research and you can find out how to get a lower receiver so that you can put it on this.
[00:20:31.794 --> 00:20:36.417]  Maybe you already have a lower receiver from an AR from way back that you just don't quite use anymore.
[00:20:36.477 --> 00:20:37.438]  It's old, something like that.
[00:20:37.638 --> 00:20:38.338]  You can throw it on this.
[00:20:38.358 --> 00:20:44.522]  You basically have a brand new rifle and you saved money by putting it together yourself and buying this kit right here, which is cheaper than the actual rifle.
[00:20:44.582 --> 00:20:47.764]  And they've got the highest quality barrels, the highest quality triggers.
[00:20:48.204 --> 00:20:49.144]  We're not just saying that.
[00:20:49.185 --> 00:20:50.605]  Go look at the third-party reviews.
[00:20:50.825 --> 00:20:54.087]  Tell them about the new rifle they're producing that's getting amazing reviews.
[00:20:54.467 --> 00:20:55.608]  And then I just got one, this .308.
[00:20:56.909 --> 00:20:58.450]  Yes, that is very... Arcadius.
[00:20:58.610 --> 00:20:59.150]  Arcadius.
[00:20:59.190 --> 00:21:00.030]  That's very exciting.
[00:21:00.070 --> 00:21:09.275]  They just came out with their own line of AR-10 platforms, which is basically an AR-15, but instead of it being a .556, it shoots a .308 round, which I know you personally like shooting a .308.
[00:21:10.436 --> 00:21:11.116]  I like them both.
[00:21:11.376 --> 00:21:15.058]  I mean, just to be clear, they've always, for years, been making this for the big manufacturers, the high-end.
[00:21:15.298 --> 00:21:16.738]  They're just now not private-labeling.
[00:21:16.758 --> 00:21:17.718]  They're putting out their own guns.
[00:21:17.898 --> 00:21:18.118]  Yes.
[00:21:18.539 --> 00:21:20.359]  Well, the one they sent you, I'm actually jealous of.
[00:21:20.399 --> 00:21:21.239]  It's a beautiful gun.
[00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:25.841]  It's set up and configured for long-range shooting, marksmanship-type things.
[00:21:26.201 --> 00:21:29.223]  Just the scope alone is something to snuggle with.
[00:21:29.283 --> 00:21:33.846]  Yeah, it's a Vortex 4x16 scope, which you can get at Head Down as well, their distributor.
[00:21:35.007 --> 00:21:39.891]  And things for people to remember is that if you want a 308, you don't have to get the 18-inch barrel.
[00:21:39.911 --> 00:21:41.252]  You don't have to get the 22-inch barrel.
[00:21:41.272 --> 00:21:42.993]  You don't have to get it set up for marksmanship.
[00:21:43.493 --> 00:21:49.077]  You can get one with a 16-inch barrel that's set up for more of an assault weapon type, you know, configuration.
[00:21:49.437 --> 00:21:53.380]  So anything you want, people just call head down, you can get anything you want made there.
[00:21:53.780 --> 00:22:01.065]  And any configuration you might want on your rifle, they're able to do that and they have 100% perfect customer service ratings there.
[00:22:01.693 --> 00:22:03.917]  Bottom line, it's not just firearms.
[00:22:04.217 --> 00:22:08.203]  A ton of accessories, very affordable, and it supports the info war.
[00:22:08.624 --> 00:22:12.730]  If you're not shopping at HDFirearms.com, you're not helping the info war.
[00:22:12.810 --> 00:22:13.992]  I mean, this is a win-win.
[00:22:14.212 --> 00:22:15.234]  Thank you all for your support.
[00:22:15.274 --> 00:22:15.895]  Check them out today.
[00:22:15.935 --> 00:22:16.376]  Thank you, Weldon.
[00:22:20.276 --> 00:22:26.649]  What he's trying to sell, the utopia he's trying to sell to the American public, simply doesn't work.
[00:22:26.749 --> 00:22:27.570]  It's impossible.
[00:22:27.791 --> 00:22:30.456]  When you say that immigrants from Mexico are...
[00:22:32.250 --> 00:22:35.831]  Criminals and rapists is in that spreading hate.
[00:22:36.151 --> 00:22:41.073]  A spokeswoman for the Davidson County Sheriff's Office said you said it was in this country illegally.
[00:22:41.333 --> 00:22:46.074]  Gurao Aguilar faces three counts of aggravated sexual battery of a person under the age of 13.
[00:22:46.854 --> 00:22:50.335]  Jacobo Gurao faces one count of rape of a person under the age of 13.
[00:22:50.455 --> 00:22:56.717]  Police believe 19-year-old Sergio Perez, an illegal immigrant, attacked the woman in her home Sunday.
[00:22:57.477 --> 00:23:10.222]  418 children were raped by illegals in the state of North Carolina in the month of August 2014 alone, where a beautiful young upstanding American woman is gunned down in broad daylight in San Francisco.
[00:23:10.662 --> 00:23:15.984]  Can I ask you if in the last three weeks President Obama has expressed his condolences to you or your family?
[00:23:17.804 --> 00:23:19.045]  I'm very sorry to hear that.
[00:23:19.065 --> 00:23:23.546]  When there have been other very public deaths in this country,
[00:23:25.939 --> 00:23:32.545]  Like Michael Brown and Trayvon Martin and Freddie Gray, the President has expressed his condolences to the family.
[00:23:32.565 --> 00:23:34.227]  I would have expected him to do that here.
[00:23:34.767 --> 00:23:44.957]  Univision's Jorge Ramos has been playing up the role of spokesperson for the leftist agenda to blindly invade America regardless of our laws.
[00:23:45.537 --> 00:23:50.562]  Increased crime and gang activity by illegal aliens and America's resistance
[00:23:50.742 --> 00:23:51.583]  Okay, who's next?
[00:23:51.683 --> 00:23:52.223]  Yeah, please.
[00:23:52.243 --> 00:23:53.084]  Excuse me, sit down.
[00:23:53.124 --> 00:23:53.904]  You weren't called.
[00:23:53.924 --> 00:23:54.284]  Sit down.
[00:23:54.404 --> 00:23:54.725]  Sit down.
[00:23:54.745 --> 00:23:54.925]  Sit down.
[00:23:54.945 --> 00:23:55.405]  Go ahead.
[00:24:21.690 --> 00:24:22.150]  No you don't.
[00:24:22.470 --> 00:24:23.391]  You haven't been called.
[00:24:25.252 --> 00:24:26.272]  Go back to Univision.
[00:24:26.912 --> 00:24:28.453]  He was eventually thrown out.
[00:24:28.873 --> 00:24:35.175]  Soon after, Ramos ran to his liberal comrade George Stephanopoulos for a shoulder to cry on.
[00:24:35.676 --> 00:24:43.459]  And Jorge, you said in that piece you've never seen anything like this before, but is it what you were expecting given the disputes between Univision and Mr. Trump?
[00:24:45.595 --> 00:24:55.346]  No, what I would expect is that I can ask a question as a journalist because that's our responsibility and I would expect Mr. Trump to answer honestly about what he really wants to do.
[00:24:55.406 --> 00:25:03.515]  Stephanopoulos, known for his completely illegal and biased donations to the tanking Hillary Clinton campaign, was happy to oblige.
[00:25:03.955 --> 00:25:08.801]  There is this impression out there that you've had this history of misogynist statements, that you are anti-women.
[00:25:08.821 --> 00:25:14.267]  You're responding to it right now, but you've got people like the chair of the New Hampshire Republican Party saying you're a chauvinist.
[00:25:14.287 --> 00:25:15.909]  How are you going to combat that impression?
[00:25:16.289 --> 00:25:17.411]  Isn't it a problem for you?
[00:25:18.300 --> 00:25:19.680]  I don't think so at all, George.
[00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:22.521]  In the meantime, I'm doing very well in the polls with women.
[00:25:22.621 --> 00:25:30.062]  This is going to be a big issue for these politicians going forward because it's about Big Brother, but on the other hand, some things do require some involvement of Big Brother.
[00:25:30.342 --> 00:25:34.383]  Big Brother, citing Megyn Kelly, was once again targeted by Trump.
[00:25:34.543 --> 00:25:45.645]  BBC reported he revived his feud with the Fox News Channel host Megyn Kelly, who returned to her show on Monday after a break, saying she must have had a bad holiday because she's really off her game.
[00:25:45.965 --> 00:26:02.539]  The odds on more of these left-wing media outbursts happening again is a foregone conclusion as the mainstream media viewership hits new lows and more and more pundits find themselves on the wrong side of the boiling anger of a majority of Americans in the near future.
[00:26:02.919 --> 00:26:09.084]  It won't be just Univision's Jorge Ramos being escorted out of the national discussion.
[00:26:09.365 --> 00:26:11.486]  John Bowne for InfoWars.com
[00:26:25.049 --> 00:26:34.113]  The months of September and October 2015 could be looked back on in years to come as the most tumultuous in generations.
[00:26:34.253 --> 00:26:39.455]  The Chinese economic meltdown is in full swing and its impact on the rest of the world is painful.
[00:26:39.935 --> 00:26:43.877]  The economies of developing countries were the first to take the hit.
[00:26:44.477 --> 00:26:49.721]  And now stock markets in 23 different countries around the world are crashing.
[00:26:49.841 --> 00:26:52.843]  Now it's our turn, and it's going to be painful.
[00:26:53.003 --> 00:26:58.286]  The Dow Jones just lost 6% in a week, tumbling more than 1,000 points, the worst since 2008.
[00:27:02.469 --> 00:27:08.431]  Expect a short-term rally in response, but the long-term picture is potentially devastating.
[00:27:08.531 --> 00:27:14.632]  In fact, some indications show that the Dow has to drop to as low as 5,000 before it reaches the bottom.
[00:27:14.712 --> 00:27:24.655]  And even as investors resort to panic selling, some sectors of the establishment financial media are still peddling this delusion that we're in a bull market.
[00:27:24.775 --> 00:27:30.718]  Analysts are still bullish on Apple, despite shares plummeting 20% from their all-time high.
[00:27:30.858 --> 00:27:38.622]  CNBC is encouraging people to pour more money into the stock market, claiming that the collapse is merely a dull year.
[00:27:39.122 --> 00:27:41.203]  Others are calling it a correction.
[00:27:41.323 --> 00:27:47.666]  When this kind of blind faith begins to take hold, you know that the bottom is about to drop out.
[00:27:48.106 --> 00:27:50.647]  This is exactly what we saw back in 2006.
[00:27:52.228 --> 00:27:52.989]  Remember this.
[00:28:13.228 --> 00:28:15.589]  I mean, it's not wealth that's increased in the last few years.
[00:28:15.629 --> 00:28:17.910]  We haven't increased our productive capacity.
[00:28:18.031 --> 00:28:21.652]  All that's increased is the paper values of our stocks and real estate.
[00:28:21.912 --> 00:28:24.894]  But that's not real wealth, no more than Nasdaq was wealth.
[00:28:25.634 --> 00:28:31.177]  When you see the stock market come down and the real estate bubble burst, all that phony wealth is going to evaporate.
[00:28:31.197 --> 00:28:34.419]  And all that's going to be left is all the debt that we accumulated to foreigners.
[00:28:34.659 --> 00:28:36.441]  Peter, I'm going to take a bet with you on this one.
[00:28:36.701 --> 00:28:44.910]  I'll bet you a penny on this one that if you'll sign a letter saying that if you're wrong, you'll sign a letter that you were wrong to me in this, but you're just way off base.
[00:28:44.930 --> 00:28:49.075]  There is nothing out there that tells us we're going to have a nice slowdown, but it's not going to be a crash.
[00:28:49.095 --> 00:28:49.856]  Alright, let me ask you this.
[00:28:49.996 --> 00:28:51.578]  I'll bet you a lot more than a penny.
[00:28:51.678 --> 00:28:53.820]  And just as they laughed at Peter Schiff back in 2006,
[00:28:55.322 --> 00:29:03.191]  Those warning of a coming collapse have been mocked into silence, despite the fact that they're already being proven right.
[00:29:03.511 --> 00:29:09.037]  Oil prices, which signal true economic health, just suffered the longest streak of losses since 1986.
[00:29:10.839 --> 00:29:14.143]  Gold is soaring again as investors flee to safety.
[00:29:14.283 --> 00:29:16.325]  The crisis is truly global.
[00:29:16.625 --> 00:29:28.118]  The Chinese meltdown has wrecked emerging economies with reduced demand causing currencies to plunge, setting the stage for what the AP predicts could be a crippling fall.
[00:29:28.638 --> 00:29:35.923]  But as Peter Schiff explains, the Chinese meltdown may be to blame for the latest downturn, but they're not telling you the whole story.
[00:29:36.383 --> 00:29:41.226]  Which is that this stock market bubble was not based on a real economic recovery.
[00:29:41.626 --> 00:29:47.510]  It was based on the hot air of quantitative easing and artificially low interest rates.
[00:29:48.070 --> 00:29:51.731]  Once QE3 was tapered, stocks went sideways.
[00:29:52.172 --> 00:29:55.913]  And as soon as an interest rate rise was on the horizon, they tanked.
[00:29:56.193 --> 00:29:58.994]  Because none of those gains were real.
[00:29:59.154 --> 00:30:05.277]  It wasn't because the economy improved, because we became more productive, because of a genuine increase in corporate earnings.
[00:30:05.657 --> 00:30:08.358]  It was all about Fed engineering.
[00:30:08.678 --> 00:30:12.359]  It was quantitative easing and 0% interest rates.
[00:30:12.639 --> 00:30:13.860]  Those were the two props.
[00:30:14.420 --> 00:30:15.181]  We're good to go.
[00:30:33.743 --> 00:30:35.325]  We're seeing a global currency war emerge.
[00:30:49.605 --> 00:30:55.828]  As developing countries desperately try to make their exports more attractive by devaluing their currencies.
[00:30:56.048 --> 00:31:00.610]  September and October are really shaping up to be pivotal months.
[00:31:00.770 --> 00:31:07.914]  The zombie stock market has been artificially reanimated for the past seven years with endless money printing.
[00:31:08.234 --> 00:31:09.775]  But the jig is up.
[00:31:10.575 --> 00:31:11.996]  QE has to end.
[00:31:12.416 --> 00:31:14.618]  Interest rates will have to rise.
[00:31:14.718 --> 00:31:22.983]  Vice Senior Analyst Larry Edelson predicts a global financial crisis of epic proportions beginning on October 7th.
[00:31:23.443 --> 00:31:26.545]  A ride like no generation has ever seen.
[00:31:26.645 --> 00:31:28.326]  The collapse is now so apparent
[00:31:28.846 --> 00:31:47.176]  That even big mainstream newspapers like the Telegraph are reporting, quote, Geopolitical tensions are also the most fraught they've been since the Cold War, with the Ukraine-Russia conflict set to reignite and talk of a contrived colour revolution in Moscow.
[00:31:47.276 --> 00:31:53.900]  The fears are also feeding into wider paranoia about other events in September that could bring catastrophe.
[00:31:54.420 --> 00:32:02.426]  Conspiracy theorists have seized upon September 23rd as a date on which a major earth-shattering event could take place.
[00:32:02.606 --> 00:32:11.752]  Some are even claiming that the timing of the collapse is biblical in nature, or that it could be seized upon to finalize plans for global government.
[00:32:12.393 --> 00:32:16.215]  That's how freaked out some people are about the next two months.
[00:32:16.475 --> 00:32:21.039]  That's all speculation, but the financial collapse is happening.
[00:32:21.419 --> 00:32:21.939]  It's here.
[00:32:22.379 --> 00:32:22.820]  It's now.
[00:32:27.321 --> 00:32:28.542]  Another major health threat.
[00:32:28.582 --> 00:32:33.464]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[00:32:33.544 --> 00:32:36.206]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[00:32:36.226 --> 00:32:43.009]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[00:32:43.269 --> 00:32:46.131]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[00:32:46.291 --> 00:32:49.192]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[00:32:49.212 --> 00:32:51.213]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[00:32:51.233 --> 00:32:54.075]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[00:32:54.155 --> 00:32:59.678]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[00:32:59.878 --> 00:33:03.379]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[00:33:03.399 --> 00:33:06.401]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[00:33:06.501 --> 00:33:13.604]  The ProPure ProOne G2.0 water filtration system is a must-have for every modern, independently-minded household.
[00:33:13.805 --> 00:33:16.706]  Protect your family's safety during an emergency.
[00:33:17.186 --> 00:33:23.330]  Hi, I'm Shane Steiner.
[00:33:23.730 --> 00:33:31.536]  A lot of you have been following my progress using Supermail Vitality.
[00:33:31.756 --> 00:33:34.437]  The last 19 weeks has been an incredible experience.
[00:33:34.818 --> 00:33:39.881]  I was feeling a little down and lethargic during the holidays, and none of the supplements that I was taking were doing any good.
[00:33:40.041 --> 00:33:44.644]  That's when my longtime friend from high school, Alex Jones, introduced me to Supermail Vitality.
[00:33:44.904 --> 00:33:46.105]  I was a little skeptical at first.
[00:33:46.465 --> 00:33:55.153]  Not only would I have the energy to work out and go to the gym, but it was actually the changes were happening to my body a lot more rapidly.
[00:33:55.293 --> 00:33:59.257]  My whole mood, my libido, everything had completely changed.
[00:33:59.698 --> 00:34:06.304]  The concentrated organic herbs, they stimulate your natural systems to produce the natural hormones that you need.
[00:34:06.664 --> 00:34:18.028]  I just really wanted to bulk up and hit it hard and I went in for about the first five weeks and was lifting heavy weight and just really hitting it hard and I gained 20 pounds of muscle immediately.
[00:34:18.188 --> 00:34:20.889]  Since that, I've decided I was going to lose some weight and slim down.
[00:34:20.969 --> 00:34:24.030]  I just changed up my workout a little bit and 35 pounds came off.
[00:34:24.310 --> 00:34:25.390]  Folks, this is not a joke.
[00:34:25.570 --> 00:34:26.351]  This is not a gimmick.
[00:34:26.451 --> 00:34:26.951]  It's real.
[00:34:27.231 --> 00:34:28.131]  Super Male Vitality.
[00:34:28.411 --> 00:34:29.932]  Available at Infowarslife.com.
[00:34:34.306 --> 00:34:39.311]  Introducing Secret 12, the new InfoWars Life vitamin B12 formulation.
[00:34:39.551 --> 00:34:45.676]  Most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic, and cannot be properly absorbed by the body.
[00:34:45.857 --> 00:34:52.843]  That's why for real results, so many are having to turn to painful B12 injections, which are known to have higher absorption rates.
[00:34:53.163 --> 00:35:03.107]  Now, InfoWarsLife.com is excited to announce that we can bring you our most bioactive, powerful form of B12 that has been developed with our exclusive, perfected process.
[00:35:03.687 --> 00:35:09.610]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimedical-grade, bioavailable, coenzyme forms of B12.
[00:35:09.850 --> 00:35:13.011]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections, and
[00:35:13.311 --> 00:35:14.412]  Adenosylcobalamin.
[00:35:14.672 --> 00:35:18.013]  Secret 12 is simply taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.
[00:35:18.274 --> 00:35:19.874]  No needles, no injections.
[00:35:20.155 --> 00:35:21.615]  Don't take my word for it.
[00:35:21.635 --> 00:35:22.836]  Try it for yourself.
[00:35:23.016 --> 00:35:24.016]  Discover the secret.
[00:35:24.237 --> 00:35:24.577]  Secret 12.

[00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:33.101]  Our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[00:35:36.923 --> 00:35:39.064]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[00:35:39.284 --> 00:35:44.485]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[00:35:44.645 --> 00:35:49.747]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[00:35:49.887 --> 00:35:52.988]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[00:35:53.288 --> 00:35:57.169]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew link to numerous conditions.
[00:35:57.409 --> 00:36:01.712]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[00:36:01.793 --> 00:36:11.941]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[00:36:12.161 --> 00:36:23.090]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs and manufactured in the USA, the new InfoWars Life Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.
[00:36:23.230 --> 00:36:25.692]  Now available exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:36:48.550 --> 00:36:56.394]  I appeared before the Congressional Committee to tell what I knew of activities which might lead to an attempt to set up a fascist dictatorship.
[00:36:57.335 --> 00:37:02.558]  The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist.
[00:37:03.158 --> 00:37:07.500]  The very word secrecy is repugnant in a free and open society.
[00:37:08.461 --> 00:37:17.726]  And we are as a people, inherently and historically, opposed to secret societies, to secret oaths, and to secret proceedings.
[00:37:18.632 --> 00:37:22.694]  President Bush signed a formal agreement that will end the United States as we know it.
[00:37:23.454 --> 00:37:26.175]  And he took the step without approval from either the U.S.
[00:37:26.215 --> 00:37:28.876]  Congress or the people of the United States.
[00:37:30.056 --> 00:37:33.518]  The secret organizations of the world power elite are no longer secret.
[00:37:34.138 --> 00:37:36.319]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:37:36.979 --> 00:37:39.180]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:37:41.924 --> 00:37:42.865]  I'm Jim Tucker.
[00:37:42.885 --> 00:37:45.868]  I've chased Bilderberg for 30 years.
[00:37:46.809 --> 00:37:48.950]  I'll never give up the chase.
[00:37:50.472 --> 00:37:56.257]  Bilderberg's plan for the whole world is nothing less than world government.
[00:37:57.538 --> 00:37:59.079]  I'm not comfortable with that at all.
[00:37:59.099 --> 00:38:00.821]  Who elected these guys to run the planet?
[00:38:02.522 --> 00:38:03.523]  They are the elitist.
[00:38:04.444 --> 00:38:07.847]  They feel they should run the world for their own selfish interests.
[00:38:09.890 --> 00:38:12.631]  Now we can see a new world coming into view.
[00:38:13.811 --> 00:38:17.752]  A world in which there is the very real prospect of a new world order.
[00:38:18.713 --> 00:38:25.455]  Bilderberg is making great progress toward a world government, and only an educated, informed public can stop them in their tracks.
[00:38:26.395 --> 00:38:31.696]  David Rockefeller admits in his own memoirs that he wants to destroy the United States!
[00:38:32.497 --> 00:38:33.517]  He's a traitor!
[00:38:34.321 --> 00:38:36.862]  It's good to be back at the Council on Foreign Relations.
[00:38:36.982 --> 00:38:42.925]  As Pete mentioned, I've been a member for a long time and was actually a director for some period of time.
[00:38:43.685 --> 00:38:47.167]  I never mentioned that when I was campaigning for re-election back home in Wyoming.
[00:38:48.387 --> 00:38:51.309]  Let us never tolerate outrageous conspiracy theories.
[00:38:58.968 --> 00:39:00.649]  I need you to move off the property, please.
[00:39:00.669 --> 00:39:01.670]  Some shots were fired.
[00:39:03.511 --> 00:39:10.295]  There's bill diverters right there.
[00:39:11.756 --> 00:39:19.621]  The Trans-Texas Corridor is a vital part because if we stop here in Texas, we stop the New World Order right here in Texas.
[00:39:20.502 --> 00:39:23.343]  This thing started here.
[00:39:23.844 --> 00:39:27.106]  And to save this country, we kill this damn thing here.
[00:39:44.967 --> 00:39:52.295]  There is a chance for the President of the United States to carry out a phrase his father used, and that is a New World Order.
[00:39:54.898 --> 00:39:57.420]  Your New World Order will fall!
[00:39:58.021 --> 00:40:00.143]  Humanity will defeat you!
[00:40:00.544 --> 00:40:01.545]  The answer to 1984 is 1776!
[00:40:24.299 --> 00:40:29.582]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:40:31.203 --> 00:40:34.325]  Once free nations are slaves to the will of a tiny elite.
[00:40:35.625 --> 00:40:38.387]  The dawn of a new dark age is upon mankind.
[00:40:40.008 --> 00:40:41.549]  Countries are a thing of the past.
[00:40:42.654 --> 00:40:49.840]  Every form of independence is under attack, with the family and even the individual itself nearing extinction.
[00:40:51.602 --> 00:40:55.045]  Close to 80% of the Earth's population has been eliminated.
[00:40:56.667 --> 00:41:03.553]  The remnants of a once free humanity are forced to live within highly controlled, compact, prison-like cities.
[00:41:05.296 --> 00:41:06.897]  Travel is highly restricted.
[00:41:08.077 --> 00:41:14.020]  Superhighways connect the megacities and keep the population from entering into unauthorized zones.
[00:41:15.321 --> 00:41:17.002]  No human activity is private.
[00:41:18.183 --> 00:41:21.644]  AI supercomputers chronicle and categorize every action.
[00:41:22.665 --> 00:41:29.068]  A prison planet dominated by a ruthless gang of control freaks whose power can never be challenged.
[00:41:29.768 --> 00:41:32.590]  This is the vision of the global elite, their goal.
[00:41:34.193 --> 00:41:38.436]  A program of total dehumanization where the science of tyranny is law.
[00:41:39.737 --> 00:41:45.262]  A worldwide control grid designed to ensure the Overlord's monopoly of power forever.
[00:41:46.322 --> 00:41:54.749]  Our species will be condemned to this nightmare future unless the masses are awakened to the New World Order master plan and mobilized to defeat it.
[00:41:57.262 --> 00:42:09.197]  Erected by a secretive group, the Georgia Guidestones are a testament to the elite's plan for a world religion, global laws, with a global court and army to enforce it.
[00:42:11.700 --> 00:42:16.065]  And set in stone, it is written that the population never rise above 500 million.
[00:42:23.556 --> 00:42:26.878]  In this film, you will learn how our world is truly governed.
[00:42:27.719 --> 00:42:33.263]  You will see how highly secretive roundtable groups interlock to form a global intelligence network.
[00:42:34.003 --> 00:42:37.665]  This group has been steering planetary affairs for hundreds of years.
[00:42:38.526 --> 00:42:42.088]  Now, in the final stage, they prepare for open world government.
[00:42:43.870 --> 00:42:46.671]  A goal tyrants throughout history have lusted after.
[00:42:48.793 --> 00:42:53.156]  Dr. Michael Kaufman is a published ecologist specializing in ecosystem research.
[00:42:54.232 --> 00:42:57.635]  Forest Ecology and Ecosystem Classification.
[00:42:59.457 --> 00:43:05.903]  Dr. Kaufman played a key role in blocking the ratification of the Convention on Biological Diversity in the U.S.
[00:43:05.943 --> 00:43:06.224]  Senate.
[00:43:07.128 --> 00:43:09.910]  The concept of a new world order has been around for centuries.
[00:43:10.070 --> 00:43:14.714]  It's been receiving tremendous play over the last half of the 20th century.
[00:43:15.594 --> 00:43:35.649]  George Bush, the first senior president, George Bush, used it a lot in his speeches and really implies that he really wants to see a order in which we have a universal or a global type of governance in which every human being on planet Earth is ultimately responsible to policies that are being formulated at the international level.
[00:43:36.232 --> 00:43:37.634]  It is a big idea.
[00:43:37.654 --> 00:43:39.777]  A new world order.
[00:43:45.441 --> 00:43:51.444]  President Bush said that the New World Order was in tune and that's what they were working for.
[00:43:51.504 --> 00:43:53.245]  The UN is part of that government.
[00:43:53.485 --> 00:43:56.707]  They're working right now very significantly for a North American Union.
[00:43:57.047 --> 00:43:59.808]  That's why there's a lot of people in Washington that don't care too much about our borders.
[00:44:00.249 --> 00:44:03.830]  They have a philosophic belief that national sovereignty is not important.
[00:44:04.151 --> 00:44:10.294]  It's also the reason I have made a very strong suggestion that we need not be in the United Nations for our national security.
[00:44:10.914 --> 00:44:11.815]  It's really always the same.
[00:44:11.855 --> 00:44:13.476]  You go back throughout all of history.
[00:44:13.496 --> 00:44:21.841]  The Roman Empire, the Soviet Union, Hitler during the Nazism was always saying that it's going to create the utopia for the average person.
[00:44:22.201 --> 00:44:26.403]  When in fact, history always shows that it does exactly the opposite.
[00:44:28.185 --> 00:44:31.206]  Conquest and empire is as old as civilization.
[00:44:33.027 --> 00:44:35.269]  Babylon, Egypt and Greece.
[00:44:38.066 --> 00:44:41.348]  They all built empires in an attempt to rule the world.
[00:44:42.769 --> 00:44:46.072]  The Roman system at its peak dominated the known world.
[00:44:47.112 --> 00:44:51.315]  Complex governmental systems were developed to control diverse populations.
[00:44:52.876 --> 00:45:00.402]  During the period between the 15th and 19th century, new empires emerged and again waged war for supremacy.
[00:45:04.025 --> 00:45:09.810]  The nobility as well as the thriving merchant class were financed by a handful of private banks.
[00:45:11.431 --> 00:45:16.215]  Many of the great money houses would hedge their bets and finance both sides of a war.
[00:45:17.857 --> 00:45:25.343]  Sophisticated intelligence gathering networks gave the financiers a clear edge over the governments they were slowly gaining control of.
[00:45:28.177 --> 00:45:41.904]  On the 18th of June, 1815, agents of the British arm of the Rothschild family looked on as Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte fought desperately to save his army from the jaws of a British-Prussian pincer attack.
[00:45:43.665 --> 00:45:54.731]  A Rothschild agent was able to get the news of Napoleon's defeat at the hands of Lord Wellington to Nathan Rothschild a full 20 hours before the news reached London.
[00:45:56.647 --> 00:46:05.454]  Nathan, the head of the British arm of the Rothschild family, put out the rumor to the London Stock Exchange that Napoleon had won the war.
[00:46:07.735 --> 00:46:16.382]  Stocks plunged by 98% and Rothschild was then able to buy up the entire British economy for pennies on the pound.
[00:46:20.425 --> 00:46:24.868]  When the news of Napoleon's defeat finally arrived, stocks soared.
[00:46:27.048 --> 00:46:32.271]  Britain was now the undisputed ruler of Europe, and Rothschild ruled England.
[00:46:37.875 --> 00:46:43.699]  In the past decade we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries in the area of health.
[00:46:44.139 --> 00:46:53.845]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:46:54.165 --> 00:46:57.928]  DNA Force is one of the most expensive formulas to produce.
[00:46:58.468 --> 00:47:03.151]  Some of the ingredients in DNA Force are $12,000 a kilogram.
[00:47:03.532 --> 00:47:09.756]  We are using the coveted, patented, only American source of PQQ, CoQ10, and more.
[00:47:10.076 --> 00:47:12.358]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[00:47:13.018 --> 00:47:15.460]  Well, we're bringing you a total win-win.

[00:47:38.576 --> 00:47:40.218]  The knowledge of the ancients.
[00:47:40.558 --> 00:47:44.101]  Tried and true, trusted herbs and extracts.
[00:47:44.361 --> 00:47:46.963]  Fused with the latest nutraceutical science.
[00:47:47.304 --> 00:47:50.707]  Introducing the all-new Ancient Defense Herbal Immunity Blend.
[00:47:50.927 --> 00:47:55.611]  Crafted with over 14 key ancient herbs and extracts to supercharge
[00:47:55.751 --> 00:47:56.532]  We're good to go!
[00:48:23.993 --> 00:48:24.813]  We're good to go.
[00:48:41.692 --> 00:48:48.337]  Julia Toriansky is a very interesting documentary filmmaker, radio TV host, BraveTheWorld.com.
[00:48:48.357 --> 00:48:49.598]  We've been covering her stuff for years.
[00:48:50.078 --> 00:48:52.500]  You know, as Paul Watson's interviewed her quite a bit.
[00:48:52.580 --> 00:48:59.265]  She's been here in Austin the last week and so I thought well why not have her in studio to talk about feminism and some of the topics that are
[00:49:00.606 --> 00:49:03.729]  Taking place, but now we have this big mass shooting that's happened.
[00:49:04.070 --> 00:49:06.913]  I promised to go to your calls, but now they're about five minutes behind.
[00:49:06.933 --> 00:49:15.141]  I'm gonna have to do a little bit of overdrive to be able to finish those, so we'll do that as well for Doug and others that have been patiently holding.
[00:49:15.161 --> 00:49:16.542]  Again, I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:49:16.943 --> 00:49:19.566]  There is a big push to demonize the Second Amendment.
[00:49:20.126 --> 00:49:23.849]  There is a big push, obviously, to demonize people being able to defend themselves.
[00:49:24.249 --> 00:49:26.290]  Julia, what do you want to tackle first?
[00:49:26.670 --> 00:49:28.472]  I know there's a lot of issues, a lot of news.
[00:49:28.532 --> 00:49:30.653]  You cover a lot of different angles.
[00:49:30.873 --> 00:49:38.198]  You try to get off of the paradigm and get off the left-right reservation.
[00:49:38.238 --> 00:49:39.339]  Where do you see the world going?
[00:49:40.120 --> 00:49:47.904]  Well, I just came from San Francisco to Austin, which has been a really incredible culture shock and kind of a positive direction.
[00:49:48.304 --> 00:49:59.550]  And as you mentioned, San Francisco has this incredible homelessness problem, and it's just an example of how governments compound and augment problems that they claim to have been fixing.
[00:49:59.990 --> 00:50:02.272]  So what happens in San Francisco specifically is
[00:50:03.232 --> 00:50:14.449]  They ship, places like New York give homeless people a one-way ticket to a bus and ship them to a warmer place like San Francisco and they all go there because San Francisco spends $167 million a year.
[00:50:18.414 --> 00:50:19.254]  On their homeless.
[00:50:19.855 --> 00:50:27.778]  But then they take away basic services like public toilets because of the fear of drug use and confined private spaces.
[00:50:28.098 --> 00:50:29.398]  So they ship all the homeless there.
[00:50:29.779 --> 00:50:34.961]  They make the illusion of providing services and taking care of them and then they take away public toilets.
[00:50:35.641 --> 00:50:37.122]  And then you get what you get.
[00:50:37.142 --> 00:50:39.322]  Drudge has the image.
[00:50:39.422 --> 00:50:42.884]  It's an epidemic of people defecating on the streets.
[00:50:43.244 --> 00:50:43.564]  It is.
[00:50:44.144 --> 00:50:44.745]  I've been there.
[00:50:44.985 --> 00:50:45.505]  I've seen it.
[00:50:48.103 --> 00:50:50.825]  I mean the last few times I went to San Francisco it's really creepy now.
[00:50:51.206 --> 00:51:00.733]  It looks like a zombie apocalypse with just bombed out of their brain or mentally ill homeless people wandering around everywhere basically crapping on themselves and I guess this is the liberal heaven?
[00:51:01.093 --> 00:51:06.977]  Yeah and the entirety of California I mean I can't speak for each individual but they're all hypocrites.
[00:51:07.357 --> 00:51:11.600]  You look at they're all claiming to be anti-racist but they
[00:51:12.481 --> 00:51:20.468]  They totally back Planned Parenthood, which is an anti-black eugenist program, originally.
[00:51:20.488 --> 00:51:21.789]  You can look that up.
[00:51:21.909 --> 00:51:23.330]  Margaret Sanger.
[00:51:23.490 --> 00:51:24.531]  It's out there.
[00:51:24.551 --> 00:51:25.912]  It's not even conspiracy theory.
[00:51:25.932 --> 00:51:33.999]  They claim to be tolerant, but if you disagree with them, they just get infuriated, start yelling at you.
[00:51:34.019 --> 00:51:34.560]  They claim to be
[00:51:35.140 --> 00:51:37.702]  Feminists, yet they don't support gun rights.
[00:51:37.962 --> 00:51:42.925]  And gun rights and gun ownership is actually congruent with feminism.
[00:51:42.985 --> 00:51:47.588]  And I think gun ownership is actually a contingent of true equality, not sameness.
[00:51:47.809 --> 00:51:48.309]  Absolutely.
[00:51:48.329 --> 00:51:54.713]  Why does government and rich people and elites get to have guns and bodyguards, but then we don't individually get to have them?
[00:51:54.733 --> 00:51:55.754]  That's just outrageous.
[00:51:56.054 --> 00:51:59.957]  And how dare Hillary, with all these armed guards, say that you or I can't have guns.
[00:52:00.237 --> 00:52:02.939]  Now tell folks a little bit about yourself, because we Google your name.
[00:52:03.419 --> 00:52:07.900]  We can see you there posing with guns, and that's always exciting to see folks doing that.
[00:52:08.620 --> 00:52:10.260]  I mean, it's just so no-brainer.
[00:52:10.280 --> 00:52:23.923]  If you want to empower women, who on average aren't as physically strong as men, and historically get preyed on by bad men, why the first thing you do is try to get women in MMA and get women armed.
[00:52:23.983 --> 00:52:25.443]  But no, no, the left doesn't want that.
[00:52:25.703 --> 00:52:28.284]  They want the state to be the woman's pimp.
[00:52:28.444 --> 00:52:38.047]  Yeah, Alex, they run all these anti-rape campaigns and vilify men and think there's a, you know, one out of every three men is a rapist, and then they take your guns away.
[00:52:38.207 --> 00:52:40.647]  As a woman, I'm like 120 pounds.
[00:52:41.068 --> 00:52:55.252]  If I'm at home alone, especially with my little kids or my family, you know, people who are dependent on me for protection, and someone breaks into my home, I am almost, I'm very likely to be less physically
[00:52:56.952 --> 00:53:00.474]  I'm more able to protect myself than a man, than a grown man.
[00:53:00.754 --> 00:53:02.255]  Most men can physically take me.
[00:53:02.816 --> 00:53:04.817]  I need a gun to equalize me.
[00:53:04.977 --> 00:53:05.557]  I need it.
[00:53:05.617 --> 00:53:09.800]  Because if I don't, even if he has a gun, at least we're on an even playing field.
[00:53:09.960 --> 00:53:11.361]  Guns are an incredible liberator.
[00:53:11.481 --> 00:53:11.761]  Right.
[00:53:12.041 --> 00:53:13.222]  And people don't understand that.
[00:53:13.302 --> 00:53:15.543]  And to me, the whole gun debate is over.
[00:53:15.583 --> 00:53:20.006]  You can print a gun, you can, even before you could print a gun, you can just make a gun at home.
[00:53:20.366 --> 00:53:22.968]  This is why places like D.C.
[00:53:23.008 --> 00:53:26.310]  have the highest gun crime because they get guns illegally anyways.
[00:53:26.570 --> 00:53:27.191]  Let me ask you this.
[00:53:27.311 --> 00:53:39.850]  Why do you think, as the statistics show this, that the gun culture, not just here but worldwide, is so popular and people don't believe the propaganda anymore, and even the left, I know, are out quietly buying guns the last six, seven years.
[00:53:40.191 --> 00:53:41.313]  Why do you think that's happening?
[00:53:42.079 --> 00:53:53.024]  I think even the progressives, when they go out there and experience life and experience the real world, they will have the state step on them in some way or another.
[00:53:53.524 --> 00:54:01.088]  And maybe even deep down inside on a dinosaur level, their dinosaur brain tells them to protect themselves.
[00:54:01.488 --> 00:54:06.730]  Because at some point, unless you're a total vegetable, you'll realize that nobody's gonna protect you.
[00:54:07.170 --> 00:54:08.670]  You have to protect yourself.
[00:54:09.131 --> 00:54:11.972]  And I don't care how they sell it or how they wrap it up.
[00:54:12.612 --> 00:54:20.474]  At the end of the day, even the best, most well-run, most funded government will not protect you fast enough against the fire.
[00:54:20.494 --> 00:54:21.775]  Yeah, where was the government?
[00:54:21.815 --> 00:54:23.936]  Where were the cops to protect these news reporters?
[00:54:24.336 --> 00:54:25.976]  And the message is, it's not their job.
[00:54:26.076 --> 00:54:26.837]  They can't do it.
[00:54:27.157 --> 00:54:27.937]  It's impossible.
[00:54:28.177 --> 00:54:36.501]  Yeah, there's been cases of fires burning and people screaming and the cops standing around waiting for orders not knowing what to do.
[00:54:36.941 --> 00:54:43.764]  And meanwhile you're funding them with your tax dollars for protection and your family burns alive or is getting murdered in your house.
[00:54:43.804 --> 00:54:48.345]  And that's because the cops are told you only do stuff when you're ordered or you'll be fired.
[00:54:48.626 --> 00:54:53.448]  In the past the cops would just go in but now it's so compartmentalized they wait and follow their orders.
[00:54:53.468 --> 00:54:56.289]  Like when there's a mass shooting the cops would sit around for hours.
[00:54:57.071 --> 00:54:57.571]  Oh my god.
[00:54:57.752 --> 00:55:00.354]  In some cases, depending on the jurisdiction, because it's their orders.
[00:55:00.854 --> 00:55:03.296]  So where's all this money going to?
[00:55:03.316 --> 00:55:04.877]  Where's all our tax dollars going to?
[00:55:04.897 --> 00:55:11.482]  You know, the state, I think what's happened now is the state is obsessed with preventing events from occurring.
[00:55:12.123 --> 00:55:13.144]  It's all about control.
[00:55:13.384 --> 00:55:22.691]  So they want to create the illusion of preventative measures, which is impossible because people will go crazy, there are bad people in the world, and they will do bad things.
[00:55:23.072 --> 00:55:24.493]  You cannot prevent that.
[00:55:24.813 --> 00:55:27.756]  Well, sure, there's discussions about banning tubing in Texas.
[00:55:27.776 --> 00:55:30.999]  They've actually discussed it because so many hundreds of ankles get broken.
[00:55:31.300 --> 00:55:31.920]  Well, big deal.
[00:55:31.980 --> 00:55:34.823]  I know going over waterfalls in an inner tube, I could break my ankle.
[00:55:35.083 --> 00:55:36.224]  I know my kids could get hurt.
[00:55:36.425 --> 00:55:37.886]  That's part of life on this planet.
[00:55:38.347 --> 00:55:41.049]  I mean, you don't get stronger unless you go through stuff like that.
[00:55:41.430 --> 00:55:46.054]  I don't send them over White Rapids, but I mean, I'll go to the beach.
[00:55:46.835 --> 00:55:50.137]  And people say, there could be jellyfish out there, don't let your kids go in.
[00:55:50.457 --> 00:55:55.941]  And there'll be like hundreds of kids playing and I go, well I know it's not perfectly safe, but it's this weird culture.
[00:55:56.361 --> 00:55:58.343]  Like I was going down to the hike and bike trail with my kids.
[00:55:59.380 --> 00:56:02.402]  About a month ago, and it had been flooding like a week before.
[00:56:02.662 --> 00:56:03.623]  It's totally safe now.
[00:56:03.643 --> 00:56:04.844]  It wasn't even going fast.
[00:56:05.204 --> 00:56:07.065]  Got down there, there were people swimming and everything.
[00:56:07.085 --> 00:56:08.646]  Some rainstorms were blowing over.
[00:56:08.746 --> 00:56:11.288]  I'd looked on my phone, knew they were blowing over, were going to be gone.
[00:56:11.748 --> 00:56:16.331]  It was raining, and this guy on a mountain bike goes, hey, you going down there with those kids?
[00:56:16.571 --> 00:56:17.072]  It's flooding.
[00:56:17.112 --> 00:56:17.712]  It's not safe.
[00:56:17.752 --> 00:56:18.433]  Storms are coming.
[00:56:19.187 --> 00:56:20.788]  And I didn't even say anything.
[00:56:20.808 --> 00:56:22.950]  I didn't say, hey, I looked on my phone beforehand.
[00:56:23.391 --> 00:56:23.931]  It's safe.
[00:56:24.431 --> 00:56:26.493]  Hey, it's about to get sunny, which it did five minutes later.
[00:56:27.274 --> 00:56:28.575]  I mean, the radar tells the truth.
[00:56:29.195 --> 00:56:30.296]  I just ignored the guy.
[00:56:30.516 --> 00:56:32.298]  I didn't even say, hey, mind your business.
[00:56:32.318 --> 00:56:34.059]  But I mean, it's a nanny state interview.
[00:56:34.119 --> 00:56:35.160]  It's sick, though.
[00:56:35.200 --> 00:56:35.821]  What do you make of that?
[00:56:36.308 --> 00:56:44.977]  Well, you know, we live in a world of systematic surveillance, aerial strikes, ground drills.
[00:56:46.698 --> 00:56:49.461]  Everything is watched, everything is attempted to be controlled.
[00:56:49.861 --> 00:56:58.290]  And the worst, the resulting thing that happens is society becomes very flaccid and jellyfish-like.
[00:56:58.670 --> 00:57:00.333]  So now instead of... Stagnant.
[00:57:00.473 --> 00:57:12.430]  Yeah, and soft too, because now instead of people confronting their issues with others, they call the police, or they call a service, or they go... My hamburger's not hot, I'm calling the police.
[00:57:12.470 --> 00:57:14.794]  Yeah, and there's this apotheosis of the
[00:57:15.414 --> 00:57:22.656]  We think they're God, but if the state is God, then it's a sacrificial God, and where are the people who are being sacrificed to it?
[00:57:23.056 --> 00:57:30.978]  Because if you call a higher authority, which the state is now a higher power to most people, then you are not an individual anymore.
[00:57:31.018 --> 00:57:32.438]  You're relying on somebody else.
[00:57:32.518 --> 00:57:36.959]  It's like if you're a 40-year-old man, and you still call your mommy to make you lunch.
[00:57:37.840 --> 00:57:39.400]  I mean, it's just that on an extreme.
[00:57:39.480 --> 00:57:42.162]  No, they're saying children, dreamers, are up to age 30.
[00:57:42.923 --> 00:57:45.986]  And they're saying that's the new, you become a man or a woman at 30.
[00:57:46.386 --> 00:57:50.770]  And that stemmed from making child work illegal, right?
[00:57:50.810 --> 00:57:55.474]  What was the point of making children under a certain age illegal to work?
[00:57:56.114 --> 00:57:58.596]  It was to keep them children until they were like 25.
[00:57:59.517 --> 00:58:19.000]  I was about to say, there were certainly abuses covered in the Jungle and other publications that the Rockefellers were doing, but now they want to ban your kids taking the trash out or getting the eggs out of a chicken coop, and they admit that is so they're a bunch of babbling idiots and aren't confident, when in truth what you did in the old days is you apprenticed your sons mainly, but daughters as well,
[00:58:20.256 --> 00:58:22.297]  And thank you to Julia for that special report.
[00:58:22.737 --> 00:58:24.158]  Well, that's the end of our show tonight.
[00:58:24.178 --> 00:58:27.600]  We do encourage you to go to PrisonPlanet.tv and get yourself a free trial.
[00:58:27.620 --> 00:58:31.342]  You can see the Alex Jones Show, the nightly news, the special reports, all right there.
[00:58:31.562 --> 00:58:38.145]  And also check out the Alex Jones channel on YouTube, where you can see everything else that we do right there for you on that format.
[00:58:38.165 --> 00:58:42.968]  Well, I'm Ja'Kari Jackson from the InfoWars Command Center, and we'll see you again tomorrow night.
[00:58:48.456 --> 00:58:49.457]  Brain Force is here.
[00:58:49.997 --> 00:58:52.299]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:58:52.559 --> 00:59:00.444]  You probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of Brain Force.
[00:59:00.884 --> 00:59:05.707]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[00:59:06.228 --> 00:59:08.109]  For example, the L-theanine inside of it.
[00:59:08.449 --> 00:59:12.852]  That is activated by the different compounds in the Yerba Mate that we put inside of it as well.
[00:59:13.052 --> 00:59:15.114]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[00:59:15.695 --> 00:59:17.196]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.
[00:59:17.316 --> 00:59:17.457]  Exactly.
[00:59:17.477 --> 00:59:21.381]  It's kind of like a car will run on one form of junky gas, but it runs really good on what it's designed for.
[00:59:21.906 --> 00:59:29.329]  And that's the principle of InfoWarsLife as far as I understand that you've always had is that it's not about synthetic chemicals and forcing actions.
[00:59:29.530 --> 00:59:37.673]  It's about letting your body do its own thing and giving your body the tools it needs to create these different compounds that are super valuable and super beneficial.
