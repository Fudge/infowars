[00:00:08.677 --> 00:00:12.542]  Can the federal government take credit for saving us from a plot of its own creation?
[00:00:12.903 --> 00:00:17.529]  The FBI has foiled about 17 plots to kill Americans during the past 10 years.
[00:00:18.169 --> 00:00:20.793]  They all have a common and reprehensible thread.
[00:00:21.253 --> 00:00:25.960]  They were planned, plotted, controlled, and carried out by the federal government itself.
[00:00:27.165 --> 00:00:33.849]  Those were just brief examples how the United States government sometimes assists and completely manufactures terror attacks.
[00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:46.177]  Now, with that in mind, on our recent trip to Ferguson, Missouri, myself and Joe Biggs had a chance to meet a man who said that he had previously worked in law enforcement and had information about terror attacks that had been largely ignored.
[00:00:46.477 --> 00:00:50.719]  Now, he didn't have any physical evidence, but here's his story, and you can hear it for yourself.
[00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:52.821]  My name is John Griggs.
[00:00:53.281 --> 00:00:54.201]  I'm 29 years old.
[00:00:54.241 --> 00:00:56.423]  I've been in law enforcement since the day I turned 21.
[00:00:57.495 --> 00:01:09.384]  I swore in in Paducah, Kentucky as a deputy and I came to Missouri in 2012 after my home burned down and started a career here.
[00:01:10.244 --> 00:01:17.670]  I was the gang task force officer for the Missouri Department of Corrections and I was assigned to Pacific, Missouri.
[00:01:19.311 --> 00:01:23.094]  And my job was to investigate, validate,
[00:01:24.406 --> 00:01:28.409]  And marginally disrupt organized crime within the institutions.
[00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:45.319]  In February of 2014, I came across several documents where an offender within the Missouri Department of Corrections was teaching others how to build improvised explosive devices.
[00:01:46.019 --> 00:01:53.404]  I'm not going to say everything about that for confidentiality purposes, but what I will say
[00:01:53.911 --> 00:01:56.093]  Is that I was told to disregard a known terrorist.
[00:01:58.254 --> 00:01:59.796]  Um, I did not.
[00:02:00.636 --> 00:02:03.759]  I contacted someone and they led me to the St.
[00:02:03.779 --> 00:02:18.130]  Louis County Intelligence Unit where I had handed over the instructions for the improvised explosive devices and an address book with 60 suspected names in it.
[00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:20.492]  I was told to give it back to the offender and leave it alone.
[00:02:20.956 --> 00:02:23.757]  Because my captain was not going to get sued by a Muslim.
[00:02:24.757 --> 00:02:25.218]  I did not.
[00:02:25.338 --> 00:02:26.338]  I lost my job.
[00:02:27.098 --> 00:02:33.921]  On June the 28th of 2014, I was attacked by two offenders carrying a 7-inch knife.
[00:02:35.201 --> 00:02:39.262]  One offender tried to grab me and put the knife right here in my side and kill me.
[00:02:39.643 --> 00:02:40.623]  Right here in my ribs.
[00:02:41.563 --> 00:02:42.424]  I have the weapon.
[00:02:42.744 --> 00:02:43.384]  I recovered it.
[00:02:43.844 --> 00:02:47.325]  I took my handcuffs and I restrained the offenders.
[00:02:47.485 --> 00:02:49.246]  I used the least amount of force necessary.
[00:02:49.662 --> 00:02:57.265]  I was written up for excessive use of force, and I said I knew I'd be okay after the incident was over.
[00:02:59.706 --> 00:03:01.686]  I told my lieutenant I needed to smoke a cigarette.
[00:03:02.387 --> 00:03:03.587]  I said, but I knew I'd be fine.
[00:03:04.187 --> 00:03:08.909]  During the debriefing for the use of force, my lieutenant then asked me, how did you know you'd be okay?
[00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:12.310]  And I said, because Jesus Christ walks with me, and I firmly believe that.
[00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:14.751]  I was immediately, immediately,
[00:03:15.407 --> 00:03:20.216]  They took my badge, they took my weapon, and they made me take a mental evaluation.
[00:03:20.937 --> 00:03:24.204]  For one month I was on administrative leave for mentioning Christ Jesus.
[00:03:24.765 --> 00:03:25.366]  For one month.
[00:03:26.533 --> 00:03:27.574]  Then I was discharged.
[00:03:27.854 --> 00:03:40.462]  When I passed the mental evaluation I wasn't supposed to pass, I came back and I was fired and I was criminally charged for theft of property by the Inspector General and then it was immediately dismissed because St.
[00:03:40.482 --> 00:03:44.565]  Louis County Intelligence Unit had every document I handed over to them.
[00:03:45.146 --> 00:03:52.671]  I was discharged from my position and I have not been able to hold a law enforcement commission since for stopping the terrorist attack.
[00:03:59.261 --> 00:04:00.282]  Brain Force is here.
[00:04:00.823 --> 00:04:03.105]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:04:03.385 --> 00:04:11.213]  You probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of Brain Force.
[00:04:12.011 --> 00:04:15.594]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable, right?
[00:04:15.614 --> 00:04:16.835]  You're going to crash afterwards.
[00:04:17.496 --> 00:04:24.122]  And the cool thing about this is it's not just a bunch of energy compounds that are going to fire your brain up to a higher RPM or whatever, which it does do.
[00:04:24.622 --> 00:04:25.503]  This is sustainable.
[00:04:25.904 --> 00:04:30.167]  This isn't going to spike and you're going to collapse and you're going to feel really bad afterwards.
[00:04:30.528 --> 00:04:34.051]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[00:04:34.111 --> 00:04:37.234]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[00:04:37.734 --> 00:04:42.536]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[00:04:43.057 --> 00:04:44.938]  For example, the L-Theanine inside of it.
[00:04:45.278 --> 00:04:49.720]  That is activated by the different compounds in the Yerba Mate that we put inside of it as well.
[00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:51.921]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[00:04:52.541 --> 00:04:54.042]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.
[00:04:54.162 --> 00:04:54.302]  Exactly.
[00:04:54.322 --> 00:04:58.224]  It's kind of like a car will run on one form of junky gas, but it runs really good on what it's designed for.
[00:04:58.752 --> 00:05:06.183]  And that's the principle of Infowars life as far as I understand that you've always had is that it's not about synthetic chemicals and forcing actions.
[00:05:06.363 --> 00:05:14.475]  It's about letting your body do its own thing and giving your body the tools it needs to create these different compounds that are super valuable and super beneficial.
[00:05:14.815 --> 00:05:16.815]  We've all been dumbed down, whether we know it or not.
[00:05:17.275 --> 00:05:19.036]  There's always hidden additives in your food.
[00:05:19.076 --> 00:05:20.576]  Even organic food has hidden additives.
[00:05:20.596 --> 00:05:24.097]  I mean, we're looking at the television screen, at least, you know, for research purposes.
[00:05:24.157 --> 00:05:29.218]  Whatever we've been doing, trying to learn something, or staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
