[00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:24.999]  Back in February of 2012, USA Today writer Tom Vandenbroek and editor Ray Locker were targeted just days after contacting the owners of Leone Industries, a Pentagon-funded PSYOP contractor.
[00:00:25.319 --> 00:00:31.983]  Mysteriously, websites popped up, some of them claiming that Vandenbroek and Locker worked for the Taliban.
[00:00:32.664 --> 00:00:38.528]  These journalists, they weren't even political, they were investigating some mine company corruption or something.
[00:00:39.497 --> 00:00:47.945]  But Leone's co-owner created a batch of fake websites, social media accounts and a fraudulent Wikipedia page in an effort to smear the journalist.
[00:00:48.485 --> 00:00:55.051]  And basically they created a whole set of fake websites that pretended to be fan websites of these journalists.
[00:00:55.531 --> 00:01:03.759]  And they just slowly turned them into complete outposts for smearing them to try and discredit their investigations.
[00:01:04.608 --> 00:01:19.413]  And as is documented in this article, and as I've written many articles about since 2008, basically the Pentagon has put out a raft of fake websites that are designed to look like independent media sources.
[00:01:19.753 --> 00:01:22.374]  They admitted this in 2008, I'm not making it up.
[00:01:23.343 --> 00:01:42.241]  You'll probably see many of them out there when you read the internet on a day-to-day basis, and it's all part of Cass Sunstein's cognitive infiltration of so-called conspiracy theorists, and putting out disinformation to confuse people, lead them away from the truth, lead them down into dead ends, and make everything futile.
[00:01:42.481 --> 00:01:52.113]  It wasn't just the fact that they had uncovered a PSYOP contractor that was given federal dollars regardless of the back taxes California-based Leone Industry owners owed.
[00:01:52.453 --> 00:01:57.079]  They were exposing the major PSYOP they were a part of, American PSYOP 101.
[00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:11.605]  A 2000 report from the desk of the Defense Science Board Task Force titled, The Creation and Dissemination of All Forms of Information in Support of Psychological Operations, PSYOP, in Time of Military Conflict.
[00:02:11.805 --> 00:02:18.568]  This unclassified report is available in PDF form as a link in the description of the report you're listening to right now.
[00:02:18.948 --> 00:02:24.833]  The report details how PSYOPs were successful and unsuccessful in major PSYOP operations overseas.
[00:02:25.093 --> 00:02:34.741]  From this research, the task force found that military PSYOP offers a unique and powerful asset in military operations, both in peacetime and in war.
[00:02:35.341 --> 00:02:38.684]  Given the broad array of complex missions conducted by U.S.
[00:02:38.724 --> 00:02:48.152]  military forces, understanding the culture and preparation of the soft battlespace is imperative to the conduct of successful operations.
[00:02:48.872 --> 00:03:05.861]  Members of the Defense Science Board Task Force include Dennis Boven of Bear Stearns, Brand Farrin of Walt Disney Imagineering, Paul Calazzi of DARPA, to name a few, the financial arena in bed with the entertainment industry, the robotics industry, and the Defense Department.
[00:03:06.121 --> 00:03:11.624]  One of the diagrams from the report describes how strategic, military, and tactical PSYOPs work.
[00:03:12.145 --> 00:03:30.175]  All signs of the times in the United States since 9-11 reeks of the genesis of a strategic PSYOP which is now morphing into a military PSYOP as indicated by the newly uncovered SOCOM document listing Utah, Texas, and Southern California as hostile areas.
[00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:31.200]  So that's a trick.
[00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:33.581]  When something's supposed to be declassified, they'll still hide it.
[00:03:34.462 --> 00:03:52.410]  So now for four or five days, they've had the different publications, Stars and Stripes, Military.com, and others going, we don't know if the document's real, but these conspiracy theorists claim that we want to take over Texas and Utah this summer and martial law.
[00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:54.130]  We're not going to have martial law this summer.
[00:03:55.111 --> 00:03:57.632]  You notice how they don't deny the operation, though, whatsoever?
[00:03:57.652 --> 00:04:00.113]  They just keep trying to, you know,
[00:04:01.027 --> 00:04:12.399]  Move the attention away from the fact that that's going on and just keep throwing out the conspiracy term and keep attacking us so it takes people's attention off of the fact that there is a mission gonna happen just like it says in the documents.
[00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:13.981]  They're not denying it.
[00:04:14.502 --> 00:04:21.790]  Today's PSYOP force includes a small but dedicated cadre of country experts familiar with the cultures and fluent in the languages of their accounts.
[00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:29.195]  There is a small and equally dedicated cadre of production personnel operating a modest suite of production capabilities.
[00:04:29.755 --> 00:04:36.740]  One such dedicated cadre of production personnel is Obama supporter and major Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein.
[00:04:37.162 --> 00:04:40.723]  Who is now shelling out films aimed at attacking the Second Amendment.
[00:04:41.123 --> 00:04:43.943]  I don't think we need guns in this country, and I hate it.
[00:04:44.323 --> 00:04:49.104]  And I think that the NRA is a disaster area, he said in an interview last year.
[00:04:49.544 --> 00:04:52.745]  They're gonna wish they weren't alive after I'm done with them.
[00:04:53.025 --> 00:04:57.106]  And now, FilmNation Entertainment has greenlit a drama entitled Ms.
[00:04:57.166 --> 00:05:04.507]  Sloan, in which an anti-gun lobbyist pushes through the federal government control legislation by targeting the gun rights lobby.
[00:05:04.927 --> 00:05:18.217]  On May 18, 2012, Michael Hastings, reporting for BuzzFeed News, delved into the bipartisan amendment that neutralized the Smith-Munt Act of 1948 and Foreign Relations Authorization Act in 1987.
[00:05:18.417 --> 00:05:27.764]  The Smith-Munt Modernization Act of 2012 legalized the use of PSYOP propaganda in the United States, funded by the State Department.
[00:05:28.084 --> 00:05:33.925]  A co-author of the bill, Representative Mac Thornberry of Texas, regarded Hastings' fears as silly.
[00:05:34.165 --> 00:05:54.689]  Matt Armstrong, former Executive Director of the State Department's Commission on Public Diplomacy, stated, Propaganda is a lie, a deception, or intentional ambiguity, none of which can be led to effective public diplomacy by any country, let alone the U.S.
[00:05:55.189 --> 00:05:58.497]  A double-speak propaganda statement if there ever was one.
[00:05:59.018 --> 00:06:00.882]  John Bowne for Infowars.com
[00:06:13.413 --> 00:06:21.255]  The globalists have controlled the mainstream media for a long time, but now they're expanding, making the weaponization even more vicious and deceptive.
[00:06:21.535 --> 00:06:23.595]  All the major networks are state-run.
[00:06:23.755 --> 00:06:26.396]  We are partnering this year with the NFL.
[00:06:26.456 --> 00:06:30.557]  The NFL has become a political weapon against the Second Amendment, and pushes Obamacare.
[00:06:30.877 --> 00:06:34.037]  MSNBC tells us that our children belong to the state.
[00:06:34.057 --> 00:06:41.319]  We have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents, or kids belong to their families, and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[00:06:41.499 --> 00:06:45.623]  It is more important than ever to realize that we are not the alternative media.
[00:06:45.823 --> 00:06:47.484]  We are the true media.
[00:06:47.625 --> 00:06:50.227]  The establishment dinosaur press is dying.
[00:06:50.327 --> 00:06:53.990]  We are in an information war and we are losing that war.
