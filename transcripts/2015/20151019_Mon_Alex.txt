[00:00:04.949 --> 00:00:06.250]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:08.032]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.032 --> 00:00:09.793]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.793 --> 00:00:11.354]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.354 --> 00:00:12.915]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.915 --> 00:00:17.119]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:24.264]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:24.264 --> 00:00:28.168]  This Monday is another total and complete information overload.
[00:00:28.168 --> 00:00:29.669]  There is so much important news.
[00:00:30.851 --> 00:00:36.775]  But I just want to harken back to Friday's top story again, or Sunday's top story when I was on 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:00:36.775 --> 00:00:38.456]  last night.
[00:00:38.456 --> 00:00:49.604]  Hillary Clinton nationwide gun ban, repeal of Second Amendment, worth considering, close quote.
[00:00:49.604 --> 00:00:53.387]  And they're now announcing they've already shut down over a thousand power plants.
[00:00:53.387 --> 00:00:57.510]  They're gonna double that in Obama's last year, what he did in seven.
[00:00:59.033 --> 00:01:02.074]  Starting next year, they want to double that before he leaves.
[00:01:02.074 --> 00:01:05.376]  That'll be 2,000-plus power plants shut down.
[00:01:05.376 --> 00:01:13.080]  And I know I just mention that constantly, but that is such a devastating military attack on this country, to bankrupt this nation.
[00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:20.283]  I just cannot get over how much they hate us, how bad they are, most of it in the Midwest and the South.
[00:01:20.283 --> 00:01:23.224]  They are screwing over the bitter clingers.
[00:01:23.224 --> 00:01:24.365]  That's you!
[00:01:24.365 --> 00:01:26.406]  They absolutely hate our guts.
[00:01:30.154 --> 00:01:34.717]  All building a new power plant every two weeks in Mexico and three a week in China.
[00:01:34.717 --> 00:01:37.059]  Owned by the very companies pulling out of the US.
[00:01:37.059 --> 00:01:38.200]  I'm sorry.
[00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:46.645]  I've got literally 200 articles or more here and I'm getting into stuff that's not even in my stack.
[00:01:46.645 --> 00:01:47.166]  Economist.
[00:01:48.646 --> 00:01:51.647]  Former political prisoner, he was arrested over it.
[00:01:51.647 --> 00:01:59.369]  He publicly, it was in the Wall Street Journal at the time, predicted the 87 stock market crash, Black Friday.
[00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.790]  And he predicted the Nikkei fall and several others.
[00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:10.092]  And when he wouldn't give up his algorithm, they threw him in the Huskow, which is what they do.
[00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:23.989]  When freedom fails, the best men rot in filthy jails, and those that cried, appease, appease, were hung by those they tried to please.
[00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:26.733]  Martin Armstrong will be joining us in the third hour.
[00:02:26.733 --> 00:02:35.503]  Joe Biggs and Josh Owens are going to be in studio with us at the bottom of the next hour, because you could almost say, when it comes to political news,
[00:02:36.601 --> 00:02:40.783]  You can quote Johnny Cash, I've been everywhere, man, I've been everywhere.
[00:02:40.783 --> 00:02:46.005]  Well, not quite, but I can see a decade down the road if they're still working here, they would have been everywhere.
[00:02:46.005 --> 00:02:47.625]  So many stories I see now.
[00:02:47.625 --> 00:02:49.666]  We were, of course, on top of it way before.
[00:02:49.666 --> 00:03:05.052]  I'm not bragging, it's dangerous to be there early, but Holman Square revealed how Chicago police disappeared 7,000 people and they even hired former Iraq dungeon keepers to run it.
[00:03:06.058 --> 00:03:10.441]  And remember, none of this was about stopping radical Islamists getting rid of the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[00:03:10.441 --> 00:03:13.803]  It was about setting the precedent for disappearing Americans.
[00:03:13.803 --> 00:03:30.154]  And so I want to tie this in to the Emergency Centers Act, the Civilian Inmate Labor Camp Program, the Army Resettlement Program, Declassification Program.
[00:03:30.154 --> 00:03:30.374]  So,
[00:03:31.445 --> 00:03:40.378]  We're going to be looking at Camp Club FEMA and looking at the exclusive Guardian report.
[00:03:40.378 --> 00:03:44.865]  Well, good for the Guardian doing an in-depth journalistic report about a year and a half after we did.
[00:03:47.526 --> 00:03:49.267]  And good job for TechNerd and everybody else.
[00:03:49.267 --> 00:03:56.072]  I'm just pointing out that we were there first two years ago, then again a year ago, and I'm really glad to see it's starting to get a lot of coverage now.
[00:03:56.072 --> 00:04:01.175]  But we're going to give you, as Paul Harvey would say, the rest of the story.
[00:04:01.175 --> 00:04:02.816]  Paul Harvey, good day.
[00:04:02.816 --> 00:04:09.901]  I remember listening to Paul Harvey almost every time my dad took me to school as a child.
[00:04:09.901 --> 00:04:12.503]  He took me to school a lot because Mom was at home.
[00:04:12.503 --> 00:04:14.524]  When he had time, he'd drive me in.
[00:04:14.524 --> 00:04:15.485]  Sometimes I took the school bus.
[00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:19.150]  I remember him picking me up, too.
[00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:20.971]  Are we going to Dallas for business or work?
[00:04:20.971 --> 00:04:24.933]  Always listening to WBAP AM.
[00:04:24.933 --> 00:04:26.934]  And now, Paul Harvey.
[00:04:26.934 --> 00:04:29.415]  I'm kind of digressing, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:04:29.415 --> 00:04:33.676]  You know, for a while, he had his son, Paul Harvey Jr., do it and imitate his dad.
[00:04:33.676 --> 00:04:36.157]  And folks would argue and go, no, Paul Harvey's alive.
[00:04:36.157 --> 00:04:38.878]  And I'd go, no, Paul Harvey's not alive.
[00:04:38.878 --> 00:04:40.879]  Not senior.
[00:04:40.879 --> 00:04:45.681]  But again, being informed in a nation of nincompoops is a conspiracy theory.
[00:04:47.415 --> 00:04:51.898]  As I said, the fact that women ever had children vaginally will be known as a conspiracy theory.
[00:04:51.898 --> 00:04:56.201]  The fact that women ever gave milk to their babies will be a conspiracy theory.
[00:04:56.201 --> 00:04:56.701]  We'll be back.
[00:04:56.701 --> 00:05:00.904]  Kit Daniels, InfoWars.com.
[00:05:00.904 --> 00:05:04.466]  Hillary Clinton said repealing the Second Amendment is worth considering.
[00:05:04.466 --> 00:05:14.533]  A presidential candidate attacked the Second Amendment during an October 16th town hall meeting in which she said we should consider a nationwide gun ban and a buyback program to eradicate private gun ownership.
[00:05:14.773 --> 00:05:19.818]  She said that America should practically outlaw guns just like Australia, Canada, and the UK.
[00:05:19.818 --> 00:05:27.385]  But she failed to mention that she supported shipping guns to Syrian rebels, the majority of whom are either ISIS militants or affiliated with the Islamic State.
[00:05:27.385 --> 00:05:36.134]  Senator Rand Paul even said she was the biggest cheerleader for distributing guns to these rebels linked to not only ISIS but also Al-Qaeda and the al-Nusra Front.
[00:05:36.394 --> 00:05:42.836]  Time and time again, journalists have interviewed the rebels in Syria and almost all of them admitted they have pledged allegiance to these radical Islamic groups.
[00:05:42.836 --> 00:05:49.757]  According to journalist Ben Reynolds, there's simply no real separation between moderate rebel groups and hardline Salafists allied with Al Qaeda.
[00:05:49.757 --> 00:05:54.338]  So in other words, Hillary thinks that the Second Amendment only applies to Al Qaeda and ISIS.
[00:05:54.338 --> 00:05:58.659]  Once again, this is Kit Daniels with InfoWars.com and keep checking back for more reports.
[00:05:58.659 --> 00:05:59.579]  Alex Jones here.
[00:05:59.579 --> 00:06:01.680]  InfoWarsStore.com is now partnering

[00:06:19.592 --> 00:06:24.755]  And if you don't have high-quality, long-lasting, storable foods, I believe you're making a huge mistake.

[00:07:33.166 --> 00:07:33.486]  I don't know.
[00:08:06.209 --> 00:08:21.315]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, in the heart of the resistance, rallying patriots worldwide.
[00:08:21.315 --> 00:08:26.998]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:26.998 --> 00:08:31.880]  Stand up and be counted for what you are about to receive.
[00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:33.580]  We are the dealers.
[00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:34.641]  We give you everything.
[00:08:37.577 --> 00:08:40.458]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are here to promote basic human freedom.
[00:08:40.458 --> 00:08:45.999]  We are here to stand up to tyrants and different organized crime syndicates worldwide.
[00:08:45.999 --> 00:08:47.819]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:08:47.819 --> 00:09:04.922]  There is a literal, overlord, globalist operation being launched right now to try to complete their construction of a private run-for-profit, above-the-law world government.
[00:09:06.912 --> 00:09:17.337]  At the same time, there is a smorgasbord, an accelerated, explosive awakening of people across the planet to exactly what's happening.
[00:09:17.337 --> 00:09:19.818]  Let me just do this, as I do occasionally.
[00:09:19.818 --> 00:09:24.901]  Let me just try to give you the headlines and then plunge back into it.
[00:09:24.901 --> 00:09:32.925]  How about just the headlines on the top of each stack, some stacks up to 20 articles thick?
[00:09:32.925 --> 00:09:34.746]  America is due for a revolution.
[00:09:36.266 --> 00:09:39.207]  New York Post.
[00:09:39.207 --> 00:09:42.208]  America is a bomb waiting to explode.
[00:09:42.208 --> 00:09:44.269]  RT.
[00:09:44.269 --> 00:09:53.873]  And then we have the globalists pushing to have that meltdown take place.
[00:09:53.873 --> 00:09:54.633]  Look at this stack.
[00:09:54.633 --> 00:09:59.415]  Probably the most important of all the news today if we really dig into it long term.
[00:10:01.167 --> 00:10:04.708]  Social media is making millennials less social.
[00:10:04.708 --> 00:10:05.348]  Study.
[00:10:05.348 --> 00:10:06.889]  Finds.
[00:10:06.889 --> 00:10:09.289]  That's like finding the ocean is blue.
[00:10:09.289 --> 00:10:11.390]  Here's one out of Bloomberg.
[00:10:11.390 --> 00:10:15.751]  Social skills are last line of defense for humans seeking work.
[00:10:15.751 --> 00:10:18.992]  You know, that's what I tell my children every day.
[00:10:18.992 --> 00:10:22.393]  I say, try to make good grades.
[00:10:22.393 --> 00:10:23.513]  They go to private school now.
[00:10:23.513 --> 00:10:24.853]  They were homeschooled for a long time.
[00:10:24.853 --> 00:10:27.074]  They liked it, but we like full-time
[00:10:29.551 --> 00:10:34.955]  Private school so they can engage in sports, swimming and tennis.
[00:10:34.955 --> 00:10:36.136]  That's what happens when they get older.
[00:10:36.136 --> 00:10:37.718]  It's a social issue, that's fine.
[00:10:37.718 --> 00:10:41.281]  But I tell them, stop pulling your hair out over homework.
[00:10:41.281 --> 00:10:43.222]  If you make a B+, I'm happy.
[00:10:43.222 --> 00:10:44.863]  Stop hyperventilating.
[00:10:44.863 --> 00:10:47.766]  You got 16 pages of homework.
[00:10:47.766 --> 00:10:48.947]  You just focus and do it.
[00:10:48.947 --> 00:10:51.729]  You can be done in an hour and then do whatever you want.
[00:10:51.729 --> 00:10:56.393]  But I said what really matters is being charming and looking people in the eyes and being funny.
[00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:02.341]  And folks don't tell their kids that.
[00:11:02.341 --> 00:11:06.685]  I mean, people think the more surly, the more arrogant they are, the further they're going to get ahead.
[00:11:06.685 --> 00:11:10.768]  And that's why you have an ocean of losers out there.
[00:11:10.768 --> 00:11:13.790]  Social media making millennials less social, study finds.
[00:11:13.790 --> 00:11:14.651]  That's CNBC.
[00:11:14.651 --> 00:11:15.432]  Here's another one.
[00:11:15.432 --> 00:11:15.932]  Bloomberg.
[00:11:15.932 --> 00:11:21.256]  Social skills are last line of defense for humans seeking work.
[00:11:21.256 --> 00:11:23.077]  They have to write articles telling folks that.
[00:11:23.077 --> 00:11:28.602]  I was watching CBS News this morning.
[00:11:30.703 --> 00:11:44.689]  I was on the elliptical and they were telling people how to wash their hair and what motions to go in with shampoo and then that you didn't need to put soap under your arms when you're in the shower because it's just not good to use soap.
[00:11:44.689 --> 00:11:47.351]  It was really bizarre.
[00:11:47.351 --> 00:11:54.314]  And it made me realize the television, the mainstream media literally is telling people how to wipe their hind ends.
[00:11:55.307 --> 00:11:59.049]  That's the old joke of, you know, tell me how to wipe my own hind end.
[00:11:59.049 --> 00:12:00.789]  That's what this has come to.
[00:12:00.789 --> 00:12:04.251]  But that's their audience.
[00:12:04.251 --> 00:12:08.053]  Arrested Development lobotomy heads.
[00:12:08.053 --> 00:12:14.716]  And I'm not being sarcastic, and I don't say that in some sardonic, power-tripping mode.
[00:12:15.799 --> 00:12:19.260]  These people are hordes of ignorant morons.
[00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:20.060]  They're black.
[00:12:20.060 --> 00:12:20.801]  They're white.
[00:12:20.801 --> 00:12:21.561]  They're Hispanic.
[00:12:21.561 --> 00:12:22.201]  They're Asian.
[00:12:22.201 --> 00:12:23.462]  We all see them.
[00:12:23.462 --> 00:12:24.802]  Man, they're scary.
[00:12:24.802 --> 00:12:26.062]  Man, they're feeble.
[00:12:26.062 --> 00:12:27.503]  Man, they're dull-eyed.
[00:12:27.503 --> 00:12:28.803]  They're walking dead.
[00:12:28.803 --> 00:12:44.109]  And the Pentagon trains an Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force drills to mow down the American people en masse during societal collapse.
[00:12:44.109 --> 00:12:45.009]  And when we and others
[00:12:46.277 --> 00:12:46.517]  I think?
[00:13:04.926 --> 00:13:10.890]  You go to an army base and you see hundreds of black role players being put in FEMA camps by troops.
[00:13:10.890 --> 00:13:15.533]  I mean, they're gearing up to grab black folks, you know, and they're gearing up to grab country people.
[00:13:15.533 --> 00:13:20.597]  They're gearing up to go after rednecks.
[00:13:20.597 --> 00:13:30.924]  For all the problems blacks have, and the way they can be misdirected like any other social group, at least they do get angry and stand up for themselves sometimes, even if it's misguided.
[00:13:30.924 --> 00:13:34.367]  And I'll quote the Full Metal Jacket statement of the sergeant
[00:13:35.333 --> 00:13:39.034]  Private Joker's silly and he's ignorant, but he's got guts and guts is enough.
[00:13:39.034 --> 00:13:45.417]  You notice the government trains to take on Christians, gun owners, rednecks, country boys, black people.
[00:13:45.417 --> 00:13:49.779]  You starting to get a pattern here?
[00:13:49.779 --> 00:13:55.101]  I wouldn't say the indigenous Americans, but the groups that have been here 400 years.
[00:13:55.101 --> 00:13:55.581]  People that
[00:13:56.698 --> 00:13:58.219]  People that think they've got a right to own a gun.
[00:13:58.219 --> 00:14:01.080]  People that think they've got a right to go to the church they want to.
[00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:02.940]  Americans are being targeted.
[00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:05.321]  People that have had a common experience with each other.
[00:14:05.321 --> 00:14:08.103]  The globalists hate our guts.
[00:14:08.103 --> 00:14:15.365]  And they're going to finance black groups to go out and kill police and stuff to then demonize black people in general and then set them up.
[00:14:15.365 --> 00:14:16.446]  But I'm digressing.
[00:14:16.446 --> 00:14:18.747]  We already know that.
[00:14:18.747 --> 00:14:22.328]  So social media making millennials less social.
[00:14:22.328 --> 00:14:22.708]  Really?
[00:14:22.708 --> 00:14:23.609]  That's what it's designed to do.
[00:14:24.497 --> 00:14:28.559]  I mean, before he died, they asked Steve Jobs, you know, what kind of iPads or iPhones your kids have.
[00:14:28.559 --> 00:14:31.801]  He said, I don't even let them have screen time, much less one of these pads.
[00:14:31.801 --> 00:14:32.601]  Are you kidding?
[00:14:32.601 --> 00:14:35.723]  I don't want mentally retarded hunchbacks.
[00:14:35.723 --> 00:14:38.924]  That was his full, basically, quote.
[00:14:38.924 --> 00:14:39.525]  That's what it does.
[00:14:39.525 --> 00:14:42.786]  It makes you mentally retarded and hunchbacked.
[00:14:42.786 --> 00:14:45.528]  Believe me, I'm hunchbacked from leaning over computers a little bit.
[00:14:46.752 --> 00:14:55.756]  Three years of stretching and training has got some of my hump reversed, but I was going towards a true hump.
[00:14:55.756 --> 00:14:58.017]  Social media making millennials less social.
[00:14:58.017 --> 00:14:59.018]  We're going to get into that.
[00:14:59.018 --> 00:15:03.600]  Social skills are the last line of defense for humans seeking work.
[00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:08.802]  But don't worry, Oslo aims to make its city car-free within four years.
[00:15:08.802 --> 00:15:09.603]  That ties into it.
[00:15:09.603 --> 00:15:10.363]  I'll be getting into that.
[00:15:11.912 --> 00:15:12.993]  That's two tiny stacks.
[00:15:12.993 --> 00:15:15.476]  Let's move on to this next juicy.
[00:15:15.476 --> 00:15:19.801]  Sources, Biden could announce decision within 48 hours.
[00:15:19.801 --> 00:15:23.485]  Joe Biden will not be bullied by Clinton campaign.
[00:15:23.485 --> 00:15:25.647]  And they're deciding on Ron now.
[00:15:25.647 --> 00:15:30.572]  Hundreds of Obama bundlers missing from Clinton's elite fundraising ranks.
[00:15:30.572 --> 00:15:33.415]  Put the pieces together, connect the dots there.
[00:15:34.906 --> 00:15:37.208]  Then we've got Nancy Pelosi.
[00:15:37.208 --> 00:15:47.575]  I literally, when I just saw her face again, when I moved this article and could see her, thought that it looked like a cadaver on a slab.
[00:15:47.575 --> 00:15:54.980]  Pelosi, Democrats open to helping GOP elect speaker.
[00:15:54.980 --> 00:15:57.882]  Oh, but I digressed back.
[00:15:57.882 --> 00:15:58.543]  I knew I digressed.
[00:15:58.543 --> 00:16:00.985]  I'll start telling a story and then I'll jump to one other part of the story.
[00:16:02.014 --> 00:16:13.805]  When the public found out that they were training to just mow down thousands of citizens rioting for food during collapse, they switched it to, oh, we're just training to mow down zombies.
[00:16:13.805 --> 00:16:20.411]  And then they put green paint on everyone to dehumanize the entire mass and then say they're dead already.
[00:16:22.452 --> 00:16:26.514]  And then I first reported on that about four years ago and people didn't believe me.
[00:16:26.514 --> 00:16:28.174]  I said, no, we got military sources.
[00:16:28.174 --> 00:16:31.716]  They're practicing mowing down human wave attacks.
[00:16:31.716 --> 00:16:41.520]  But to get around the fact that the troops are saying, hey, we're practicing killing our countrymen, they call it a zombie attack drill.
[00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:43.121]  But nevertheless, that's what's happening.
[00:16:44.175 --> 00:16:46.815]  And every time I mention that without showing an article, people don't believe me.
[00:16:46.815 --> 00:16:52.636]  So guys, train, search engine, military trains to take on zombies.
[00:16:52.636 --> 00:17:02.978]  You'll have LA Times, Associated Press, Reuters, Army Times, Stars and Stripes, and it's got the Marines, Army, and everybody training that we're dehumanized, we're dead already, and they're going to mow us all down.
[00:17:02.978 --> 00:17:09.219]  And that's what we're going to be covering with our reporters, Joe Biggs and Josh Owens, at the bottom of the next hour.
[00:17:09.219 --> 00:17:10.359]  There it is, CNN.
[00:17:10.359 --> 00:17:13.360]  Pentagon document lays out battle plan against zombies.
[00:17:14.636 --> 00:17:16.336]  And that's just a battle plan.
[00:17:16.336 --> 00:17:19.857]  They actually have the drills, so you can find those.
[00:17:19.857 --> 00:17:24.478]  Holmes Square revealed how Chicago police disappeared 7,000 people.
[00:17:24.478 --> 00:17:34.460]  We're going to tell you about the exact way they're already preparing for the mass disappearance of millions of Americans.
[00:17:34.460 --> 00:17:36.300]  Oh, you think you'll just hide out and use cash?
[00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:37.680]  Look at the Wall Street Journal.
[00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:41.261]  We always knew when this got announced it was another shoe to drop, another balloon to go up.
[00:17:42.796 --> 00:17:44.457]  Big banks to America's firms.
[00:17:44.457 --> 00:17:46.437]  We don't want your cash.
[00:17:46.437 --> 00:17:47.478]  Cash to be banned.
[00:17:47.478 --> 00:17:52.000]  That's Wall Street Journal.
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:52.980]  Let me continue here.
[00:17:52.980 --> 00:17:54.981]  Sorry, I didn't get too deep into this stack.
[00:17:54.981 --> 00:17:58.502]  Pelosi, Democrats open to helping GOP elect Speaker.
[00:17:58.502 --> 00:18:02.324]  And I bet Jeffrey Dahmer was open to grabbing 12-year-olds out of the hallway of his apartment.
[00:18:02.324 --> 00:18:05.225]  Oh, I mean, we know you're open to that.
[00:18:05.225 --> 00:18:07.386]  And we know you worked with Boehner to make sure he got in.
[00:18:07.386 --> 00:18:08.606]  We get it, witch.
[00:18:08.606 --> 00:18:11.608]  We get you two parties team up together against the American people.
[00:18:11.608 --> 00:18:12.328]  We got it, scum.
[00:18:14.625 --> 00:18:17.569]  Mrs. Mafia.
[00:18:17.569 --> 00:18:23.077]  Paul Ryan open borders push with Luis Gutierrez exposed in 2013 video.
[00:18:23.077 --> 00:18:25.501]  For 20 years Paul Ryan wants totally open borders.
[00:18:25.501 --> 00:18:27.544]  He's a complete globalist like Peter Sutherland.
[00:18:30.031 --> 00:18:34.673]  House GOP faces leadership disarray as it returns to the Capitol.
[00:18:34.673 --> 00:18:43.817]  They call it disarray, it's a great victory that we're forcing a battle to try to get a patriot in, but the media will never even discuss there's a Tea Party move to try to get somebody in.
[00:18:43.817 --> 00:18:46.758]  It's all just, they're in disarray, look at them!
[00:18:46.758 --> 00:18:48.399]  Will Paul Ryan take it?
[00:18:48.399 --> 00:18:48.819]  Maybe.
[00:18:48.819 --> 00:18:55.181]  He's got Pelosi support, oh my gosh.
[00:18:55.181 --> 00:18:57.542]  Ryan says he's open to running for Speaker.
[00:18:57.542 --> 00:18:58.343]  Oh, he's open.
[00:18:59.844 --> 00:19:02.926]  Don't play too hard to get.
[00:19:02.926 --> 00:19:07.810]  Sanders would raise payroll taxes on everyone to fund paid family leave.
[00:19:07.810 --> 00:19:10.151]  Yeah, that's what Trump breaks down.
[00:19:10.151 --> 00:19:10.792]  And it's true.
[00:19:10.792 --> 00:19:14.795]  I mean, that's what all the socialists don't get.
[00:19:14.795 --> 00:19:19.198]  You gotta pay for this stuff.
[00:19:19.198 --> 00:19:24.342]  Amazon posts blistering response to critical New York Times article.
[00:19:24.342 --> 00:19:27.364]  We're going to be getting into that report.
[00:19:27.364 --> 00:19:28.545]  Also, the plot against
[00:19:30.410 --> 00:19:37.452]  Donald Trump, how they have fifth column infiltrators going into his organization, New York Post, to try to discredit him from within.
[00:19:37.452 --> 00:19:43.313]  Yeah, we've actually dealt with infiltrators as well.
[00:19:43.313 --> 00:19:54.096]  I mean, it's not as bad as Terminator 1, where you're in your underground war, and one, dogs start barking, and they throw off their jacket and start firing on everyone, but it's pretty darn close.
[00:19:54.096 --> 00:19:54.516]  I love it!
[00:19:54.516 --> 00:19:56.237]  It's when you know you're over enemy targets.
[00:19:56.237 --> 00:19:56.617]  We'll be back.
[00:19:59.646 --> 00:20:07.392]  Numana, the true pioneer of healthy storable foods and preparedness products, has gone and done it again.
[00:20:07.392 --> 00:20:14.838]  Numana is now the first food storage company in the country to offer organic powdered milk, free of hormones.
[00:20:14.838 --> 00:20:18.661]  Our goal is to change the way you look at storable food.

[00:20:54.660 --> 00:20:55.760]  New Manna.
[00:20:55.760 --> 00:20:58.942]  Food storage you'll love to eat.
[00:20:58.942 --> 00:21:04.624]  Your liver can be full of fatty deposits, built-up toxins, and even dangerous objects known as liver stones.
[00:21:04.624 --> 00:21:19.069]  We worked with the top developers in the field of detox to take tried and true herbs and other compounds known to safely cleanse the liver and infuse it with the latest research and technological development on concentrating these ingredients to give you the maximum effect.
[00:21:19.269 --> 00:21:27.075]  Liver Shield is the only liver support product on the market that uses a patented Spigyrex blend of powerful organic herbs that support detoxification.
[00:21:27.075 --> 00:21:32.499]  And when you visit InfoWarsLife.com, see the instructional video on how to do a six-day liver detox.
[00:21:32.499 --> 00:21:36.202]  This isn't a game, and let me tell you, the results are dramatic.

[00:21:58.550 --> 00:22:05.252]  My name is Bill Bonner, and I'm the president of the largest private news and research network in the world.
[00:22:05.252 --> 00:22:10.734]  And I paid for this airtime because I have an important message to the American people.
[00:22:10.734 --> 00:22:15.275]  There's a change coming that the government isn't telling you about.
[00:22:15.275 --> 00:22:19.557]  This change has deep implications for life in America.
[00:22:19.557 --> 00:22:23.818]  From where you shop, to the doctors you visit, and the family you want to protect,
[00:22:24.398 --> 00:22:27.539]  Look, I've made predictions like this before.
[00:22:27.539 --> 00:22:30.480]  Thing is, I was right then, too.
[00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:34.901]  A few years ago, I warned that housing prices would collapse.
[00:22:34.901 --> 00:22:35.982]  They did.
[00:22:35.982 --> 00:22:41.044]  Before that, I warned that dot-com companies would crash.
[00:22:41.044 --> 00:22:42.204]  They did.
[00:22:42.204 --> 00:22:46.065]  Those who listened had a chance to save themselves.
[00:22:46.065 --> 00:22:48.426]  But this has nothing to do with the stock market.
[00:22:48.426 --> 00:22:49.946]  This will affect us all.
[00:22:49.946 --> 00:22:51.647]  You can watch the video for free right

[00:23:27.994 --> 00:23:31.458]  So you've got to take a state construction license exam or certification.
[00:23:31.458 --> 00:23:33.900]  Can't decide on what books or what chapters to study?
[00:23:33.900 --> 00:23:38.165]  Discover right now how you can eliminate unnecessary books and wasted study time.
[00:23:38.285 --> 00:23:38.725]  I think so.
[00:24:10.825 --> 00:24:22.010]  I'm gonna come back in the next segment and break down the huge announcements concerning rate increases and fines via Obamacare.
[00:24:22.010 --> 00:24:25.831]  The latest on the imploding borders and what's happening in Europe.
[00:24:25.831 --> 00:24:31.133]  An anti-immigration party wins Swiss election in slide to the right.
[00:24:31.133 --> 00:24:34.175]  We're gonna get into science and technology news.
[00:24:34.175 --> 00:24:37.516]  Samsung to make robots cheaper than any human worker, close quote.
[00:24:39.104 --> 00:24:45.087]  We'll also get into the situation escalating with the stabbings and murders in East Jerusalem.
[00:24:45.087 --> 00:24:53.351]  They've had to crack into the emergency seed vault arcs in the North Pole, or at the North Pole.
[00:24:53.351 --> 00:24:55.252]  That's in CNN.
[00:24:55.252 --> 00:24:57.192]  More on the big banks to ban cash.
[00:24:57.192 --> 00:24:59.474]  It's all being announced.
[00:24:59.474 --> 00:25:01.915]  We'll break it down.
[00:25:01.915 --> 00:25:06.457]  But before I go any further, I did want to make the announcement Friday
[00:25:09.139 --> 00:25:28.451]  But Peter Schiff, who's a Von Mies free market economist, Patriot, former Ron Paul chief advisor, was scheduled to be on the show to talk about developments in the market, as he is every two weeks, every second Friday.
[00:25:28.451 --> 00:25:29.712]  But he couldn't do it.
[00:25:29.712 --> 00:25:32.293]  He said, my dad's dying right now.
[00:25:32.293 --> 00:25:35.315]  He's, quote, passing over to the other side right now.
[00:25:35.315 --> 00:25:38.337]  I didn't want to obviously say, hey, pray for
[00:25:41.491 --> 00:25:44.053]  Erwin Schiff, because that was a private matter at that time.
[00:25:44.053 --> 00:25:45.495]  He did die a few hours later.
[00:25:45.495 --> 00:25:50.799]  And then, of course, his son put out a eulogy, a good article, yesterday.
[00:25:50.799 --> 00:25:52.601]  Erwin Schiff passes away.
[00:25:52.601 --> 00:25:56.625]  Patriot had a lifelong affair with our nation's founding principles.
[00:25:56.625 --> 00:25:58.947]  And I knew Erwin Schiff pretty good.
[00:25:58.947 --> 00:26:02.270]  Worked with him to get a show on Genesis that got on over 100 stations.
[00:26:02.270 --> 00:26:03.531]  He was based out of Las Vegas.
[00:26:04.946 --> 00:26:07.087]  They put him in prison for his book.
[00:26:07.087 --> 00:26:09.708]  The judge said it was national news.
[00:26:09.708 --> 00:26:13.410]  It was in the Las Vegas Review Journal and Wall Street Journal.
[00:26:13.410 --> 00:26:19.013]  Forbes even said it was a political prisoner and said, stop publishing this book saying the income tax is a fraud.
[00:26:19.013 --> 00:26:20.774]  We're going to put you in jail.
[00:26:20.774 --> 00:26:23.696]  They put him in jail for 15 years.
[00:26:23.696 --> 00:26:25.857]  His sentence had about a year left.
[00:26:25.857 --> 00:26:27.658]  He died of cancer on Friday.
[00:26:29.301 --> 00:26:33.103]  And I went to dinner with him more than 10 times, had him on my show countless times.
[00:26:33.103 --> 00:26:35.664]  He, of course, hadn't been on for over 13, 14 years.
[00:26:35.664 --> 00:26:38.025]  He's been in federal prison.
[00:26:38.025 --> 00:26:40.066]  And they put him in one where he couldn't even see his family.
[00:26:40.066 --> 00:26:42.347]  And then the computer recognizes your voice print.
[00:26:42.347 --> 00:26:45.929]  His voice was so bad the last few months, he couldn't even talk to family over the phone.
[00:26:45.929 --> 00:26:48.290]  Prison didn't care, wouldn't let him talk to him.
[00:26:48.290 --> 00:26:50.651]  But his son tried to get there, you know, for when he died.
[00:26:50.651 --> 00:26:53.613]  I don't want to get off into the whole
[00:26:55.504 --> 00:27:07.391]  Israel thing, but I saw a minority of the comments on Infowars, you know, saying, why didn't this rat Jew ever speak about the New World Order?
[00:27:07.391 --> 00:27:16.577]  You know, and just all these sickening statements when that's all Erwin Schiff did for like 40 years was fight the New World Order, the private Federal Reserve, the IRS, write books on it.
[00:27:18.041 --> 00:27:31.851]  And it's just the hatred of different groups of people, mindlessly in general, by nobodies, with a keyboard, that don't even know who somebody is, is sickening and discrediting.
[00:27:31.851 --> 00:27:38.176]  And I know a lot of those are bots, and haters, and leftist operatives that try to make the site look racist.
[00:27:38.176 --> 00:27:45.522]  And there is a lot of problem with some of the lobbies in Israel, and I criticize it, and some of the leftist anti-gun groups in Israel financing gun control here.
[00:27:47.379 --> 00:28:05.609]  And that's legitimate criticism, but just mindless hatred of different groups of people, and then to just project onto someone that they never fought the New World Order, just to say that, so you could try to have stolen glory, is sickening.
[00:28:05.609 --> 00:28:10.652]  And I had a real desire, the people writing that stuff, if I saw you, to punch you in the nose.
[00:28:11.854 --> 00:28:23.741]  Because he died a political prisoner and could have stopped publishing the book, The Federal Mafia, and they told him he could come out any time, they would let him be paroled if he just recanted, and he wouldn't.
[00:28:23.741 --> 00:28:26.343]  That's a William Wallace type character.
[00:28:26.343 --> 00:28:31.566]  I don't care if he was black, white, German, Jewish, Chinese, I can admire people like that.
[00:28:31.566 --> 00:28:36.449]  And see, that's what separates myself from people like the New Black Panther Party or the Ku Klux Klan.
[00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:42.163]  Is that I'm about individuals and what they produce, what they stand for.
[00:28:42.163 --> 00:28:43.765]  Can I count on them in a pinch?
[00:28:43.765 --> 00:28:44.686]  Are they honorable?
[00:28:44.686 --> 00:28:51.772]  Like Martin Luther King said, we don't judge people on their race, but on the content of their character and their deeds.
[00:28:51.772 --> 00:29:02.401]  And just thank God that I'm in a society, the human society, where I'm not a member of any group because I wouldn't be a member of any organization that would have me.
[00:29:02.401 --> 00:29:04.623]  To quote Charlie Chaplin, I think that's who said that.
[00:29:07.455 --> 00:29:12.701]  I'm just in the human race here and I admire humanity and I admire individuals.
[00:29:12.701 --> 00:29:15.265]  There are a lot of groups I don't like.
[00:29:15.265 --> 00:29:18.969]  But Erwin Schiff was an amazing person.
[00:29:22.932 --> 00:29:35.059]  I don't know if in that position, and a judge said, just stop publishing this book, I won't put you in prison for 15 years, would I have the courage facing federal prison to do what he did and go to prison?
[00:29:35.059 --> 00:29:37.961]  And I probably would have his courage, but I haven't proven that.
[00:29:37.961 --> 00:29:39.842]  I don't want to test that.
[00:29:39.842 --> 00:29:41.263]  It's just, he's a hero.
[00:29:41.263 --> 00:29:45.665]  And to watch people disparage a dead hero makes me want to kick your ass.
[00:29:45.665 --> 00:29:46.566]  That's all I have to say.
[00:29:48.226 --> 00:29:52.153]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:52.153 --> 00:29:54.838]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:58.956 --> 00:30:01.077]  Kit Daniels, Infowars.com.
[00:30:01.077 --> 00:30:06.200]  Did you know that since 1960, the number of married adults has decreased from 72% down to 51?
[00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:09.222]  In other words, barely half of all adults in the U.S.
[00:30:09.222 --> 00:30:11.123]  are married, which is a record low.
[00:30:11.123 --> 00:30:17.746]  Case in point, a Catholic pastor recently revealed he's only performing five marriages a year, down from 35 over 25 years ago.
[00:30:17.746 --> 00:30:20.888]  And the pastor, Charles Pope, said other priests have had similar experiences.
[00:30:20.888 --> 00:30:24.390]  But why are men shying away from marriage and even relationships with women in general?
[00:30:24.650 --> 00:30:26.552]  Well, Pastor Pope pointed out the obvious.
[00:30:26.552 --> 00:30:30.355]  Radical feminism is destroying marriage by driving a wedge between men and women.
[00:30:30.355 --> 00:30:38.602]  For one thing, thanks to feminism, many men are now so terrified of being labeled rapists that they shy away from showing any interest towards women, even women who hate feminism.
[00:30:38.602 --> 00:30:43.307]  And because of that, many women now complain they cannot find real men who have the confidence to approach them.
[00:30:43.307 --> 00:30:47.991]  There's a video report on InfoWars.com entitled, Why Men Are Giving Up On Marriage, which breaks it all down.
[00:30:48.271 --> 00:30:52.072]  And you can also find the video on our new YouTube channel called Resistance News.
[00:30:52.072 --> 00:30:58.994]  Once again, this is Kit Daniels with InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.TV, and keep checking back for more news and reports.
[00:30:58.994 --> 00:31:00.234]  I want more candy!
[00:31:00.234 --> 00:31:01.274]  I want more video games!
[00:31:01.274 --> 00:31:02.074]  Mine, mine, mine!
[00:31:02.074 --> 00:31:11.797]  And it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and help children focus.
[00:31:11.797 --> 00:31:14.497]  All of our children are hit with modern mind control.
[00:31:14.497 --> 00:31:17.838]  Television, music, fast food, GMOs, sugars, you name it.
[00:31:18.058 --> 00:31:24.380]  Young humans have not yet developed their nervous system and are being hammered daily by globulous concoctions.
[00:31:24.380 --> 00:31:29.501]  It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down and then are put on dangerous psychotropic drugs.
[00:31:29.501 --> 00:31:35.882]  Working with my team, we set out to find the best formula with the highest quality ingredients that children would actually like and take.
[00:31:35.882 --> 00:31:43.344]  We worked with the leading manufacturer in nutritional supplements that are safe for children to bring you the most affordable and powerful calming formula out there.
[00:31:43.624 --> 00:31:51.173]  Introducing ChildEase with herbs and calming extracts like chamomile and lemon balm and essential nutrients that taste great.

[00:33:02.590 --> 00:33:04.192]  Humanity has the power!
[00:33:04.192 --> 00:33:05.753]  We have the power!
[00:33:05.753 --> 00:33:07.014]  Do you want to fight?
[00:33:07.014 --> 00:33:11.378]  You better believe you got one!
[00:33:11.378 --> 00:33:16.483]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[00:33:16.483 --> 00:33:17.925]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:27.873 --> 00:33:37.640]  We need to get into the situation in Europe because it's the same policy they're trying here in the United States and North America to break down civilization.
[00:33:37.640 --> 00:33:42.903]  They're working with their so-called conservative counterparts to complete the larger globalist plan.
[00:33:42.903 --> 00:33:50.288]  Because you don't get campaign funds unless you go along with the New World Order agenda.
[00:33:50.288 --> 00:33:54.732]  I also want to obviously get more into the situation in Syria.
[00:33:55.942 --> 00:34:06.806]  More on the situation with the election, and more and more mainstream news saying America is ripe for revolution.
[00:34:06.806 --> 00:34:22.732]  Just like the Middle East was ripe for revolution to democratize and be more pro-Western, so the West funded radical jihadists to take over in the last five years, and those think tank statements from Google and the United Nations have now all come out.
[00:34:25.114 --> 00:34:35.120]  Notice we're taking down the secular regimes like Iraq and Syria and Egypt and Libya and putting in the truly nasty Saudi-run regimes.
[00:34:35.120 --> 00:34:36.741]  That is coming up.
[00:34:36.741 --> 00:34:40.863]  I want to get to really what's still our top story.
[00:34:40.863 --> 00:34:41.744]  Hillary came out.
[00:34:41.744 --> 00:34:42.524]  We covered it Friday.
[00:34:42.524 --> 00:34:43.805]  We covered it Sunday.
[00:34:43.805 --> 00:34:45.246]  It's on Infowars.com.
[00:34:45.246 --> 00:34:49.388]  It's a big deal because if you listen to Obama and others, it's the new talking point.
[00:34:49.388 --> 00:34:53.671]  Hillary Clinton nationwide gun ban, repeal of Second Amendment, quote, worth considering.
[00:34:55.626 --> 00:35:05.935]  They are coming for the guns.
[00:35:05.935 --> 00:35:20.507]  But before we go any further, I wanted to just let the listeners and viewers know about some of the really exciting specials we're running at InfoWarsStore.com and InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:35:22.145 --> 00:35:27.567]  And these really are game-changing products, in my experience, in other people's experiences.
[00:35:27.567 --> 00:35:33.529]  You can read the 4.8 on average reviews by Power Reviews and others.
[00:35:33.529 --> 00:35:36.109]  Highly respected third-party outfits.
[00:35:36.109 --> 00:35:39.991]  I mean, go to Power Reviews and others and look at other products.
[00:35:39.991 --> 00:35:41.491]  They're lucky they got three stars.
[00:35:41.491 --> 00:35:42.892]  Ours has 4.8.
[00:35:42.892 --> 00:35:45.252]  It's really good products, plus our listeners love us.
[00:35:45.252 --> 00:35:46.053]  We love you as well.
[00:35:48.473 --> 00:35:50.976]  Super Male Vitality is back in stock.
[00:35:50.976 --> 00:36:00.345]  It's a bunch of concentrated herbs and known botanical compounds that all I know is make me feel 15 years younger.
[00:36:00.345 --> 00:36:04.869]  And thank God I got on this three years ago when it was being developed.
[00:36:04.869 --> 00:36:06.831]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:36:06.831 --> 00:36:10.875]  It is back in stock right now.
[00:36:10.875 --> 00:36:11.836]  We also have several
[00:36:13.914 --> 00:36:19.016]  Other specials that are running, of course, in the fall and winter is the best time to boost your immune system.
[00:36:19.016 --> 00:36:20.477]  And we have 15% off.
[00:36:20.477 --> 00:36:21.437]  It's usually $19.
[00:36:21.437 --> 00:36:22.738]  Now it's less.
[00:36:22.738 --> 00:36:30.441]  It's very inexpensive because these are great known, well documented herbs to help with your immunity, to boost immunity and overall health.
[00:36:31.081 --> 00:36:31.341]  I think?
[00:36:50.383 --> 00:36:52.284]  on not having any toxicity.
[00:36:52.284 --> 00:36:53.945]  Truly a game changer.
[00:36:53.945 --> 00:36:58.408]  It's about $25 on sale generally under its official brand name.
[00:36:58.408 --> 00:37:00.529]  This is a product we just private label.
[00:37:00.529 --> 00:37:02.671]  We normally sell it for $19.95 discounted.
[00:37:02.671 --> 00:37:03.911]  It's private labeling.
[00:37:03.911 --> 00:37:06.893]  We're able to go below the suggested retail.
[00:37:06.893 --> 00:37:09.975]  Well, now we've gone even lower.
[00:37:09.975 --> 00:37:12.116]  $16.95.
[00:37:12.116 --> 00:37:17.179]  And I just give my children a squirt of this every single morning under the tongue.
[00:37:17.179 --> 00:37:18.060]  It tastes great.
[00:37:18.060 --> 00:37:18.580]  They love it.
[00:37:21.169 --> 00:37:25.391]  Tastes kind of like a Ricola cough drop or something is the best way to describe it.
[00:37:25.391 --> 00:37:26.372]  That's basically what it is.
[00:37:26.372 --> 00:37:28.352]  It's just concentrated known herbs.
[00:37:28.352 --> 00:37:30.694]  It doesn't have the sugar or alcohol in it.
[00:37:30.694 --> 00:37:32.675]  There's 15% off on that.
[00:37:32.675 --> 00:37:39.238]  We are going to continue to run this special throughout the week as folks are really taking advantage of it and liking it.

[00:38:39.543 --> 00:38:39.804]  Box
[00:38:46.872 --> 00:38:47.733]  Just zoom in on the P.L.
[00:38:47.733 --> 00:38:50.455]  box and I'll be able to read that for folks as I see it across the room.
[00:38:50.455 --> 00:38:51.916]  I should have it memorized, but P.L.
[00:38:51.916 --> 00:39:00.061]  box 19549 Austin, Texas 78760.
[00:39:00.061 --> 00:39:05.505]  And I should announce this more because we're on a lot of new AM and FM affiliates in places like New York City.
[00:39:05.505 --> 00:39:07.086]  We'll be announcing that station next week.
[00:39:07.086 --> 00:39:09.428]  They want us to really build up to it.
[00:39:09.428 --> 00:39:10.269]  We've been on it about a month.
[00:39:10.269 --> 00:39:13.631]  They're already getting a great response.
[00:39:13.631 --> 00:39:16.253]  We've got, I don't know, like 20-something new affiliates this last month.
[00:39:17.813 --> 00:39:23.758]  I can't tell you what Drudge coming in did two weeks ago, two weeks ago tomorrow.
[00:39:23.758 --> 00:39:31.665]  We probably had, let's not exaggerate, 30 station inquiries for AMFM to InfoWars, and we don't even handle it.
[00:39:31.665 --> 00:39:33.707]  GCN handles it up in Minnesota.
[00:39:33.707 --> 00:39:39.231]  We had like 30 inquiries or more from AMFM stations saying, hey, get a hold of us, we want to get you on.
[00:39:40.032 --> 00:39:42.314]  I guess they don't even know to go find GCN.
[00:39:42.314 --> 00:39:52.224]  We should probably, for AM and FM stuff, put a link on our affiliate page or a link on the listen page over to GCN and their phone number, because the stations end up contacting us.
[00:39:52.224 --> 00:39:56.888]  But again, GCNlive.com is the network website for folks who want to pick it up.
[00:39:57.589 --> 00:40:03.013]  But just very exciting things happening, and I want to thank you, the listeners, and you, the viewers, for doing that.
[00:40:03.013 --> 00:40:09.577]  But I should add, because we have a lot of new affiliates, what I was first trying to say, that we are simulcast television.
[00:40:09.577 --> 00:40:16.722]  Not just a webcam that myself and others pioneered 15 plus years ago, but a full TV news production.
[00:40:18.700 --> 00:40:23.244]  And you can find those details again at InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[00:40:23.244 --> 00:40:34.413]  And more importantly, if you've already found it, the podcast, the Droid app, the iPhone app, all of it, send that link to friends and family and neighbors.
[00:40:34.413 --> 00:40:44.060]  Tell folks about the show and how there's forbidden information that they need to be made aware of.
[00:40:44.060 --> 00:40:48.044]  And that is what this is.
[00:40:50.546 --> 00:41:04.473]  We are forbidden information that the globalists don't want the general public to come in contact with and they're moving heaven and earth right now to try to spike the First Amendment in the United States and free speech from Canada to Germany right now.
[00:41:05.359 --> 00:41:09.860]  To try to shut this information down and people like us down.
[00:41:09.860 --> 00:41:13.122]  Because it's so effective, because it's dead on target.
[00:41:13.122 --> 00:41:27.366]  We know the globalist are, we know their philosophy, we know their plans, we know their endgames, we know their weaknesses, we know what makes them tick, their modus operandi, their modes of operation.
[00:41:27.366 --> 00:41:29.927]  We carry the light in the dark of the night.
[00:41:31.604 --> 00:41:42.613]  And we're here to set brush fires in the minds of humans across the globe to promote a free, open society of free will and free association.
[00:41:42.613 --> 00:41:46.196]  Now, before I get to the other news, let's get into Hillary Clinton.
[00:41:46.196 --> 00:41:53.542]  This is such a big deal that we've had Obama and we've had CNN and we've had all these hosts say, hey, it's reasonable.
[00:41:53.542 --> 00:41:57.425]  We'll just do what Australia and the UK did.
[00:42:01.033 --> 00:42:06.637]  And what they did... You know, I'm having a Pavlovian response.
[00:42:06.637 --> 00:42:07.878]  I literally can't look at Hillary anymore.
[00:42:07.878 --> 00:42:12.521]  They just put her on screen and she looks like the alien from Mars Attacks that comes to the White House.
[00:42:12.521 --> 00:42:16.344]  She actually has an alien Martian melon head.
[00:42:16.344 --> 00:42:24.870]  I just... And I could attack her for all of her crimes and all the things she's committed and coming after our guns, but I just cannot look at her anymore.
[00:42:25.620 --> 00:42:29.482]  I have a Pavlovian nausea response to looking at her.
[00:42:29.482 --> 00:42:29.822]  You know what?
[00:42:29.822 --> 00:42:31.483]  I'm going to force myself to look.
[00:42:31.483 --> 00:42:35.745]  Put the Gorgon back on.
[00:42:35.745 --> 00:42:36.926]  Put Hillary back on screen.
[00:42:36.926 --> 00:42:38.467]  I have to force myself to look at Medusa.
[00:42:38.467 --> 00:42:45.811]  Put her on.
[00:42:45.811 --> 00:42:52.114]  I'm not even being dramatic here.
[00:42:52.114 --> 00:42:53.395]  Okay, okay.
[00:42:53.395 --> 00:42:54.355]  That's enough, that's enough, that's enough.
[00:43:04.764 --> 00:43:07.084]  Yes, what do they call that therapy?
[00:43:07.084 --> 00:43:10.485]  Aversion therapy?
[00:43:10.485 --> 00:43:15.287]  My mother, I guess she doesn't mind if I tell this story.
[00:43:15.287 --> 00:43:21.248]  My mother did aversion therapy when I was about five years old for her birthday.
[00:43:21.248 --> 00:43:24.289]  We budgeted the money because my dad was working two jobs to go through dental school.
[00:43:25.094 --> 00:43:26.756]  I was about four or five years old, I'll never forget.
[00:43:26.756 --> 00:43:30.659]  And she went off for a week to this aversion therapy place.
[00:43:30.659 --> 00:43:32.882]  I think it was called Schick or something.
[00:43:32.882 --> 00:43:34.303]  You'd see the ads when I was a kid.
[00:43:34.303 --> 00:43:39.768]  I didn't see it at the time, I was about 12, but in Dallas.
[00:43:39.768 --> 00:43:46.155]  And you'd go in and there was all these dirty mirrors and like trash all over the floor and piles of cigarettes and ashtrays everywhere.
[00:43:46.155 --> 00:43:49.478]  And he would sit there and smoke cigarettes one after the other.
[00:43:52.921 --> 00:43:55.922]  While they shocked you intermittently.
[00:43:55.922 --> 00:43:59.723]  And my mother never wanted another cigarette again.
[00:43:59.723 --> 00:44:03.144]  After a week of that, I'll tell you.
[00:44:03.144 --> 00:44:10.326]  But see, I've already had the aversion therapy.
[00:44:10.326 --> 00:44:13.807]  I've already been through the Clintons for 20 plus years on air.
[00:44:13.807 --> 00:44:18.668]  I know so many crimes they've committed that it makes my head spin to even look at her.
[00:44:18.668 --> 00:44:20.149]  And so when I look at her, it's like,
[00:44:22.478 --> 00:44:25.920]  Showing a meerkat an image of a cobra.
[00:44:25.920 --> 00:44:31.042]  You know, meerkats' main enemy is cobras because they go into their holes in Africa and eat them.
[00:44:31.042 --> 00:44:37.785]  And so when I see Hillary, it's like a giant King Cobra is fanned out in front of my desk.
[00:44:37.785 --> 00:44:39.305]  And it's just like, ah!
[00:44:39.305 --> 00:44:42.967]  And I'll be here looking at all this news and all the stuff I want to cover.
[00:44:42.967 --> 00:44:46.549]  And then they'll pop her up on screen with some article.
[00:44:46.549 --> 00:44:48.029]  And I don't even look at the article now.
[00:44:48.029 --> 00:44:51.611]  I have a Pavlovian meerkat response of hissing.
[00:44:53.410 --> 00:44:54.371]  But I guess I should.
[00:44:54.371 --> 00:44:57.814]  I mean, she's gonna try to confiscate the guns.
[00:44:57.814 --> 00:44:59.715]  Obama's talking about it, too.
[00:44:59.715 --> 00:45:04.219]  She's putting out weird Stalin posters of herself.
[00:45:04.219 --> 00:45:08.663]  And then she's saying, it's totally reasonable, it's no big deal, it's like changing a tire.
[00:45:08.663 --> 00:45:13.047]  You know, they had automatic weapons, which they didn't, and they're killing everybody, and there's these, you know, spat.
[00:45:14.246 --> 00:45:23.893]  This raft, this uptick in all these shootings, which isn't true, and so they just, you know, said we're going to buy the guns back.
[00:45:23.893 --> 00:45:26.836]  And then they didn't turn them in, well then they went and got them.
[00:45:26.836 --> 00:45:32.640]  And she sits there talking to her soft, stupid constituents that aren't going to fight the Civil War.
[00:45:32.640 --> 00:45:41.187]  They're just going to cuddle in their, you know, houses with no power and basically get in a fetal position and hug their Hillary Clinton snuggle toys.
[00:45:44.264 --> 00:45:54.302]  But when she's on C-SPAN last week, it's the constituents, the weird women, nodding and getting off on the reflected glory of Hillary onto them.
[00:45:55.353 --> 00:45:57.154]  They've never accomplished anything.
[00:45:57.154 --> 00:45:58.314]  They are nothing.
[00:45:58.314 --> 00:46:00.615]  They have incredibly low IQs.
[00:46:00.615 --> 00:46:17.221]  They found, for whatever reason, liberals in the Canadian, US, and British studies are six times more likely to steal, six times more likely in all three studies not to give, and many times more likely in another study I saw, I forget the details, to have Alzheimer's.
[00:46:18.200 --> 00:46:19.161]  Because they're not alive.
[00:46:19.161 --> 00:46:20.842]  They just fidget around.
[00:46:20.842 --> 00:46:22.283]  They're little group thinkers.
[00:46:22.283 --> 00:46:23.905]  They have no place in society.
[00:46:23.905 --> 00:46:25.266]  They help no one.
[00:46:25.266 --> 00:46:26.947]  Most of them don't have kids.
[00:46:26.947 --> 00:46:28.649]  They watch TV all day.
[00:46:28.649 --> 00:46:31.531]  And so their brains just start shutting down.
[00:46:31.531 --> 00:46:32.992]  The body says, time to die.
[00:46:32.992 --> 00:46:34.634]  I'm not of use.
[00:46:34.634 --> 00:46:36.775]  Self-destruct.
[00:46:36.775 --> 00:46:43.241]  So, let's look at the self-hating, self-destruct switch creatures.
[00:46:46.468 --> 00:46:53.430]  Who Mark Dice and our reporters go out as well and duplicate and we say, should we put gun owners in forced labor camps?
[00:46:53.430 --> 00:46:54.210]  Yes.
[00:46:54.210 --> 00:46:56.950]  So we're going to take their guns and put everybody that has guns in prison.
[00:46:56.950 --> 00:46:59.471]  Yes, I'm sick of these gun owners.
[00:46:59.471 --> 00:47:07.433]  And they'll sit back on a power trip at night, folks, while we're in a FEMA camp, feeling powerful, even though they probably couldn't deadlift 45 pounds.
[00:47:10.345 --> 00:47:16.387]  Even though they never helped anybody, they don't want to help, they just have the moral superiority that they're helping people.
[00:47:16.387 --> 00:47:28.212]  They're the most envious, jealous, greedy, non-giving, piles of dog manure, the planet's, well those actually have use in fertilization, excuse me, piles of maggot vomit the world has ever seen.
[00:47:30.595 --> 00:47:31.976]  And I'm sorry, it was worse than that.
[00:47:31.976 --> 00:47:37.139]  A student signed a petition to have gun owners executed in concentration camps.
[00:47:37.139 --> 00:47:40.281]  Yeah, he did one where they said execute everybody and torture them.
[00:47:40.281 --> 00:47:42.243]  The other was with adults.
[00:47:42.243 --> 00:47:46.425]  Well, these were college students, they're adults too, but Arrested Development, they're about five-year-olds.
[00:47:46.425 --> 00:47:51.869]  But they hear about totalitarianism and they get off on it.
[00:47:51.869 --> 00:47:54.371]  So it was worse than I said, excuse me.
[00:47:54.371 --> 00:47:56.852]  It pretty much always is, isn't it?
[00:47:56.852 --> 00:47:59.034]  We're going to go inside the FEMA camps in about an hour and
[00:48:00.629 --> 00:48:04.110]  Well, not about an hour, about 45 minutes from now.
[00:48:04.110 --> 00:48:16.052]  But let's go ahead and go to Hillary, just up there like it's just something she's letting slide out in church, something she kind of wants to not take responsibility for, silent but deadly.
[00:48:16.052 --> 00:48:21.953]  She just is just putting it out there that it's no big deal, it's real reasonable.
[00:48:21.953 --> 00:48:28.994]  We'll just do what Australia did, you know, total gun confiscation, except for single shot and mass gun buybacks and steamrollers.
[00:48:30.481 --> 00:48:32.163]  Rolling over the guns by the millions.
[00:48:32.163 --> 00:48:32.964]  It's no big deal.
[00:48:32.964 --> 00:48:34.325]  And crime exploding.
[00:48:34.325 --> 00:48:36.988]  Let's go ahead and go to the club.
[00:48:36.988 --> 00:48:38.949]  You know, Australia is a good example.
[00:48:38.949 --> 00:48:40.791]  Canada is a good example.
[00:48:40.791 --> 00:48:42.553]  The UK is a good example.
[00:48:42.553 --> 00:48:44.015]  Why?
[00:48:44.015 --> 00:48:45.996]  Because each of them had mass killings.
[00:48:45.996 --> 00:48:47.058]  Look at the men at these places.
[00:48:47.058 --> 00:48:50.961]  Australia had a huge mass killing about 25, 25 years ago.
[00:48:50.961 --> 00:48:51.782]  Look at those women.
[00:48:51.782 --> 00:48:53.344]  Canada did as well.
[00:48:53.344 --> 00:48:53.524]  Creepy.
[00:48:53.524 --> 00:48:54.085]  So did the UK.
[00:48:55.844 --> 00:49:02.255]  And in reaction, they passed much stricter gun laws.
[00:49:02.255 --> 00:49:07.445]  In the Australian example, as I recall, that was a buyback program.
[00:49:08.024 --> 00:49:27.979]  The Australian government, as part of trying to clamp down on the availability of automatic weapons, offered a good price for buying hundreds of thousands of guns and then they basically clamped down going forward in terms of having more of a background check approach, more of a permitting approach.
[00:49:29.880 --> 00:49:48.592]  But they believed, and I think the evidence supports them, that by offering to buy back those guns, they were able to, you know, curtail the supply and to set a different standard for gun purchases in the future.
[00:49:48.592 --> 00:49:50.933]  Now, communities have done that in our country.
[00:49:50.933 --> 00:49:52.654]  Several communities have done that.
[00:49:55.017 --> 00:50:01.800]  But I think it would be worth considering doing it on the national level if that could be arranged.
[00:50:01.800 --> 00:50:11.725]  Remember, I know after the terrible 08 financial crisis, I think one of the programs that President Obama... That's enough, just shut her down.
[00:50:11.725 --> 00:50:17.328]  Yeah, the financial crisis created pretty much by the Democrats.
[00:50:17.328 --> 00:50:21.630]  I mean, that's something that Larry Summers and Bill Clinton and Hillary all cooked up in the 90s.
[00:50:21.630 --> 00:50:22.991]  Republicans went along with it, but
[00:50:25.882 --> 00:50:28.067]  I mean, if you're informed, you realize how dangerous that is.
[00:50:28.067 --> 00:50:30.573]  But her constituents, to a man, to a woman.
[00:50:33.018 --> 00:50:34.579]  Their ancestors never had guns.
[00:50:34.579 --> 00:50:38.301]  Their ancestors never stood up for anybody.
[00:50:38.301 --> 00:50:45.044]  It is alien to them that a man would even know how to fight or a woman would know how to fight back for themselves.
[00:50:45.044 --> 00:50:49.346]  We've got the socio-economic actuaries, the sociology on these people.
[00:50:49.346 --> 00:50:51.768]  These people are dead already.
[00:50:51.768 --> 00:50:56.230]  These people basically are walking, breathing Alzheimer's machines.

[00:51:13.905 --> 00:51:17.867]  Communist China freely allows the sale of bulletproof armor plates, while our U.S.
[00:51:17.867 --> 00:51:20.929]  politicians argue from banning Americans from owning body armor.
[00:51:20.929 --> 00:51:22.490]  Does that sound right to you?

[00:52:11.136 --> 00:52:13.817]  All of our children are hit with modern mind control.
[00:52:13.817 --> 00:52:17.398]  Television, music, fast food, GMOs, sugars, you name it.
[00:52:17.398 --> 00:52:23.639]  Young humans have not yet developed their nervous system and are being hammered daily by globalist concoctions.
[00:52:23.639 --> 00:52:26.140]  It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down.
[00:52:26.440 --> 00:52:27.021]  We're good to go.

[00:54:05.031 --> 00:54:07.633]  Yeah, you ain't never done nothing.
[00:54:19.315 --> 00:54:21.176]  You that hide behind walls.

[00:54:34.499 --> 00:54:36.079]  You that never done nothing.
[00:54:36.079 --> 00:54:40.701]  Put the belt to destroy.
[00:54:40.701 --> 00:54:43.221]  You play with our world like it's your little toy.
[00:54:43.221 --> 00:54:45.562]  You play with my world.
[00:54:47.324 --> 00:54:51.648]  Like it's your little toy.
[00:54:51.648 --> 00:54:55.892]  You put a gun in my hand.
[00:54:55.892 --> 00:55:00.276]  And you hide from my eyes.
[00:55:00.276 --> 00:55:04.540]  And you turn and run farther when those fast bullets fly.
[00:55:04.540 --> 00:55:07.142]  That's right.
[00:55:07.142 --> 00:55:09.244]  Like Judas of old.
[00:55:09.244 --> 00:55:13.468]  You lie and deceive.
[00:55:16.589 --> 00:55:24.153]  It's Bob Dylan bringing us in.
[00:55:24.153 --> 00:55:31.036]  Time to see through their lies, folks.
[00:55:31.036 --> 00:55:36.078]  Bipartisan evil that wants bodyguards for itself but no guns for you.
[00:55:36.078 --> 00:55:44.502]  And a race to domesticate and dumb down the public so that they're so enslaved they really believe owning a gun would be detrimental.
[00:55:45.442 --> 00:55:48.743]  Most Democrats I talk to go, if I had a gun, I'd kill myself.
[00:55:48.743 --> 00:55:49.863]  I might blow my own head off.
[00:55:49.863 --> 00:55:51.224]  I might start killing people.
[00:55:51.224 --> 00:55:52.204]  I'd go crazy.
[00:55:52.204 --> 00:55:57.426]  Why, I'm on psychotropic drugs, and I wear women's clothes, and I'm crazy, and I can't do that.
[00:55:57.426 --> 00:56:01.987]  That was Buzz Bissinger.
[00:56:01.987 --> 00:56:10.590]  Because after he went on air and said, I want to kill Alex Jones with a rifle, and then the ambassador's daughter goes, yeah, Piers, you could wear a military officer's uniform when you kill him.
[00:56:10.590 --> 00:56:12.430]  She's going, uh, uh.
[00:56:12.430 --> 00:56:13.911]  These are deranged loons.
[00:56:15.177 --> 00:56:17.979]  A gun owner wouldn't get up and talk about shooting innocent people on air.
[00:56:17.979 --> 00:56:18.740]  They wouldn't talk.
[00:56:18.740 --> 00:56:21.522]  And then Bissinger goes, it's true, I'm mentally ill.
[00:56:21.522 --> 00:56:22.282]  I shouldn't have a gun.
[00:56:22.282 --> 00:56:24.664]  That's why it freaked me out to think of having one.
[00:56:24.664 --> 00:56:26.145]  I just want to buy women's clothing.
[00:56:26.145 --> 00:56:28.326]  And it's like, whatever.
[00:56:28.326 --> 00:56:31.208]  The point is, this is how whacked out these people are.
[00:56:31.208 --> 00:56:34.311]  If I had guns, I'd kill people.
[00:56:34.311 --> 00:56:35.652]  I just want women's clothing.
[00:56:35.652 --> 00:56:40.955]  And you're just like, what does it have to do with anything?
[00:56:40.955 --> 00:56:42.116]  That's who these people are.
[00:56:42.116 --> 00:56:42.997]  They're crazy town.
[00:56:44.634 --> 00:56:58.566]  Even crazier was the ambassador's daughter, flushing on air when they talked about killing me, and going, and you know when a woman's sexually aroused, she'll wear the uniform when you kill him, I'll be there, I'll go, I mean, it's like, what?
[00:56:58.566 --> 00:57:01.869]  Who are these freaks?
[00:57:01.869 --> 00:57:06.953]  Appears, she's gonna wear it, I'll kill him, I mean, these people are sick!
[00:57:07.915 --> 00:57:09.275]  Yeah, scroll down, you can see her right there.
[00:57:09.275 --> 00:57:10.896]  Look at her, just... Oh my gosh!
[00:57:10.896 --> 00:57:11.676]  Oh yeah!
[00:57:11.676 --> 00:57:13.036]  Oh yeah!
[00:57:13.036 --> 00:57:14.876]  And I'm not trying to be sarcastic here.
[00:57:14.876 --> 00:57:19.037]  She starts going... I mean... Kill him!
[00:57:19.037 --> 00:57:19.777]  Yeah!
[00:57:19.777 --> 00:57:23.378]  Once we have the guns, we'll kill him!
[00:57:23.378 --> 00:57:24.598]  And Bissinger's... I wear clothes!
[00:57:24.598 --> 00:57:25.459]  Women's clothes!
[00:57:25.459 --> 00:57:25.979]  Murder!
[00:57:25.979 --> 00:57:29.139]  I mean, you know, this is who we're fighting.
[00:57:29.139 --> 00:57:31.660]  It's a mass mental illness wave.
[00:57:31.660 --> 00:57:35.461]  Like hell opened up and demonic spirits came out and are taking people over or something.
[00:57:35.461 --> 00:57:36.841]  I don't know, maybe it's space aliens.
[00:57:37.759 --> 00:57:38.872]  But this is not normal.
[00:57:42.213 --> 00:57:43.934]  Yes, Buzz Bissinger is Space Alien.
[00:57:43.934 --> 00:57:45.434]  That's his name, right?
[00:57:45.434 --> 00:57:48.275]  I'm just going from memory here, teleprompter free.
[00:57:48.275 --> 00:57:50.876]  And of course, the real problem is people don't have social skills.
[00:57:50.876 --> 00:57:52.337]  They're losing language.
[00:57:52.337 --> 00:57:57.218]  People will hear you use a complex word and they'll go, ugh, weird, ugh.
[00:57:57.218 --> 00:57:59.579]  All they can do is just act trendy and go, ugh.
[00:57:59.579 --> 00:58:01.620]  And I'm going to cover that next hour.
[00:58:01.620 --> 00:58:08.842]  Really, our top story other than the gun grab, a new social media-making millennial's less social study finds.
[00:58:08.842 --> 00:58:10.263]  Really, they need a study to tell you that?
[00:58:12.836 --> 00:58:17.837]  And then Bloomberg, social skills are last line of defense for human-seeking work.
[00:58:17.837 --> 00:58:20.058]  Human-seeking work, because here's the headline.
[00:58:20.058 --> 00:58:24.319]  Samsung to make robots cheaper than any human worker.
[00:58:24.319 --> 00:58:31.921]  And all you trendies think they're getting you all domesticated and disarmed so that you'll have some new great fantasia you're going to live in.
[00:58:31.921 --> 00:58:34.021]  They're getting you ready to bioweapon you.
[00:58:34.021 --> 00:58:41.263]  They're going to send the droids out in the spring to clean your dead bodies out of your compact apartments while we're dug in fighting Cybertron.
[00:58:41.263 --> 00:58:41.803]  Stay with us.
[00:58:42.867 --> 00:58:48.833]  Visit GCNLive.com today.
[00:58:48.833 --> 00:58:52.978]  Many of the products at InfoWarsLive.com are true game changers.
[00:58:52.978 --> 00:58:57.402]  They are compounds that in many areas of the world are actually sold by prescription.
[00:58:57.402 --> 00:59:04.690]  But when we look at a product like Survival Shield Nason Iodine X2, it's something that really has been hiding in plain view for over a hundred years.
[00:59:04.850 --> 00:59:15.515]  The federal government mandated from the 20s until the 70s that iodine, a crude form of it, be added to table salt because of the incredible health problems that dietary deficiency in iodine was causing.
[00:59:15.515 --> 00:59:19.037]  I want to challenge the listeners who've not tried X2 for yourselves.
[00:59:19.037 --> 00:59:20.157]  What do you have to lose?
[00:59:20.157 --> 00:59:28.461]  You are the tip of the spear in the fight for human liberty and you're getting a high quality product that has absolutely changed my life and many other people's lives that I know.
[00:59:28.601 --> 00:59:31.923]  And the final reason to try X2 is that it's so hard to keep in stock.
[00:59:31.923 --> 00:59:36.105]  We ordered the biggest shipment ever six months ago and that is about to sell out.
[00:59:36.105 --> 00:59:38.406]  It may be a month or two until more comes in.
[00:59:38.406 --> 00:59:44.630]  I want to challenge all of you in the next week to stock up on Survival Shield X2 today at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[00:59:44.630 --> 00:59:46.231]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:02.950 --> 01:00:04.631]  Big Brother?
[01:00:04.631 --> 01:00:06.192]  Mainstream Media.
[01:00:06.192 --> 01:00:07.952]  Mainstream Media.
[01:00:07.952 --> 01:00:09.713]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:09.713 --> 01:00:11.294]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.294 --> 01:00:12.835]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:12.835 --> 01:00:17.037]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.037 --> 01:00:21.359]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:21.359 --> 01:00:28.402]  I was just looking on screen.
[01:00:28.402 --> 01:00:29.863]  They're running a feed of Infowars.
[01:00:31.099 --> 01:00:38.282]  And it's one of those photos of Bush at the Crawford Ranch, holding hands with the now deceased King Saud.
[01:00:38.282 --> 01:00:45.345]  I guess his brother now runs the show in adult form.
[01:00:45.345 --> 01:00:48.867]  And just how bizarre that is.
[01:00:48.867 --> 01:00:56.250]  To have one of the worst dictatorships in the world, and our president kisses these guys on the lips, and then holds their hands.
[01:00:58.652 --> 01:01:01.174]  And Obama bows down to all this royalty.
[01:01:01.174 --> 01:01:07.781]  And they walk together in the blue bonnets.
[01:01:07.781 --> 01:01:20.112]  And of course it came out over the weekend what we already knew, a new memo, there's three of them now, confirmed that Tony Blair fixed intelligence a year before Iraq war, making it up that Saddam was involved in 9-11.
[01:01:26.121 --> 01:01:28.522]  And just how they committed those crimes.
[01:01:28.522 --> 01:01:36.787]  And then now those frauds aren't even as naked, to use that key term, as what Obama's doing.
[01:01:36.787 --> 01:01:40.269]  I wonder, what's the next Republican gonna do if it's not a patriot?
[01:01:43.120 --> 01:01:44.901]  Notice I call him It's now.
[01:01:44.901 --> 01:01:48.123]  Whatever creature comes out of Washington.
[01:01:48.123 --> 01:01:50.265]  And I look at Tony Blair.
[01:01:50.265 --> 01:01:52.146]  See, it was okay because he was trendy.
[01:01:52.146 --> 01:01:53.267]  He was liberal.
[01:01:53.267 --> 01:01:55.008]  So it was okay if they killed a million Iraqis.
[01:01:55.008 --> 01:02:02.032]  And it was okay if he liked George W. Bush because, you know, it was the special relationship.
[01:02:02.032 --> 01:02:03.934]  Oh, and there's some special relationships going on.
[01:02:03.934 --> 01:02:05.455]  You can certainly believe that's happening.
[01:02:07.858 --> 01:02:14.139]  Those guys don't age at an accelerated rate four times the normal as presidents or prime ministers for nothing.
[01:02:14.139 --> 01:02:18.040]  It's not just they get them sleep-deprived, waking them up all the time to make decisions.
[01:02:18.040 --> 01:02:24.962]  They put them on all sorts of designer amphetamine, all sorts of designer drugs, so they're totally controlled.
[01:02:24.962 --> 01:02:29.703]  And now George W. Bush can barely get out of the bathtub, they say.
[01:02:29.703 --> 01:02:33.884]  He's so drugged out and is in his own whacked-out wonderland.
[01:02:37.995 --> 01:02:47.278]  And then we have people like Jeb Bush lecturing us saying Donald Trump can't be president because he doesn't have the military experience the Bush family does.
[01:02:47.278 --> 01:03:04.883]  What of chicken hawking and running and getting deferments and getting jobs in the guard back home and then wearing cod pieces 30 years later saying mission accomplished literally wearing cod pieces and getting out of intruder aircraft on the decks of aircraft carriers?
[01:03:04.883 --> 01:03:07.444]  Why not wear a Superman outfit for heaven's sakes?
[01:03:08.882 --> 01:03:14.006]  Instead of a black codpiece, you're gonna have a red one.
[01:03:14.006 --> 01:03:18.050]  You're either with the codpiece or you're against the codpiece.
[01:03:18.050 --> 01:03:30.280]  But if you wanna know why all this is happening and what the bigger picture is, when we come back, we're gonna get into the replacement of humans with machines and how that ties into, first, deliberately making sure we're not humans to begin with.
[01:03:30.280 --> 01:03:34.364]  Because it's a metaphysical crime to enslave and murder
[01:03:36.004 --> 01:03:42.129]  To enslave, suck dry, sanguinate, and then murder a humanoid in the globalist system.
[01:03:42.129 --> 01:03:55.499]  But if you can first turn them into selfish, gibbering, mindless, programmable machines that run around not wanting to have any accomplishments, but actually just feeling trendy and feeling like they're superheroes,
[01:03:57.065 --> 01:04:24.418]  Then you can go ahead and take those folks out and they'll willingly go along with the inoculations, the GMO, and then the subsequent health care actuary designed to remove whatever capital you or your parents had accrued from you before you are pushed out into the stratosphere out of the end of a incinerator
[01:04:27.188 --> 01:04:32.749]  Chimney.
[01:04:32.749 --> 01:04:38.130]  So when we return, we will get into all of it.
[01:04:38.130 --> 01:04:41.191]  Bigger bite for health law penalty on uninsured.
[01:04:41.191 --> 01:04:42.191]  Associated Press.
[01:04:42.191 --> 01:04:43.151]  Wait a minute.
[01:04:43.151 --> 01:04:44.371]  There was no penalty.
[01:04:44.371 --> 01:04:45.572]  The media said so.
[01:04:45.572 --> 01:04:52.933]  They said it was racist that Drudge and Alex Jones said that and that there was no penalty and it was a conspiracy theory.
[01:04:52.933 --> 01:04:54.954]  But why do they now say there's a big penalty?
[01:04:58.820 --> 01:05:00.882]  Kit Daniels, Infowars.com.
[01:05:00.882 --> 01:05:04.445]  Hillary Clinton said repealing the Second Amendment is worth considering.
[01:05:04.445 --> 01:05:14.513]  A presidential candidate attacked the Second Amendment during an October 16th town hall meeting in which she said we should consider a nationwide gun ban and a buyback program to eradicate private gun ownership.
[01:05:14.753 --> 01:05:19.797]  She said that America should practically outlaw guns just like Australia, Canada, and the UK.
[01:05:19.797 --> 01:05:27.362]  But she failed to mention that she supported shipping guns to Syrian rebels, the majority of whom are either ISIS militants or affiliated with the Islamic State.
[01:05:27.362 --> 01:05:36.128]  Senator Rand Paul even said she was the biggest cheerleader for distributing guns to these rebels linked to not only ISIS but also Al-Qaeda and the Al-Nusra Front.
[01:05:36.388 --> 01:05:42.834]  Time and time again, journalists have interviewed the rebels in Syria, and almost all of them admitted they have pledged allegiance to these radical Islamic groups.
[01:05:42.834 --> 01:05:49.761]  According to journalist Ben Reynolds, there's simply no real separation between moderate rebel groups and hardline Salafists allied with Al Qaeda.
[01:05:49.761 --> 01:05:54.326]  So, in other words, Hillary thinks that the Second Amendment only applies to Al Qaeda and ISIS.
[01:05:54.326 --> 01:05:58.170]  Once again, this is Kit Daniels with InfoWars.com, and keep checking back for more reports.
[01:05:58.630 --> 01:06:02.133]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[01:06:02.133 --> 01:06:10.380]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[01:06:10.380 --> 01:06:15.804]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[01:06:15.804 --> 01:06:18.326]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[01:06:18.326 --> 01:06:20.428]  We now have the synergistic solution.

[01:06:28.502 --> 01:06:29.623]  BrainForce is here.
[01:06:29.623 --> 01:06:31.844]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[01:06:31.844 --> 01:06:36.827]  You probably noticed I've been more focused, less brain fog, more energy, and it's because of BrainForce.
[01:06:36.827 --> 01:06:40.129]  There's always hidden additives in your food, even organic food has hidden additives.
[01:06:40.129 --> 01:06:43.611]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[01:06:43.611 --> 01:06:45.592]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[01:06:45.592 --> 01:06:47.694]  It doesn't have stimulants, it doesn't have garbage in it.
[01:06:47.694 --> 01:06:49.695]  It has natural things that do it clean.
[01:06:49.695 --> 01:06:55.298]  You will find BrainForce and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[01:06:58.360 --> 01:06:59.621]  Another major health threat.
[01:06:59.621 --> 01:07:04.604]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[01:07:04.604 --> 01:07:07.285]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[01:07:07.285 --> 01:07:14.310]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[01:07:14.310 --> 01:07:17.211]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[01:07:17.211 --> 01:07:20.253]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[01:07:20.253 --> 01:07:22.274]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[01:07:22.274 --> 01:07:25.116]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[01:07:25.196 --> 01:07:30.918]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.

[01:07:56.507 --> 01:08:03.975]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:08:03.975 --> 01:08:06.798]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:08.394 --> 01:08:31.120]  This has happened so many times that I was trying during the break to remember how many times I've seen it happen where the CIA, British intelligence, Saudi intelligence and others have been caught creating fake Al Qaeda and now fake ISIS propaganda videos.
[01:08:31.120 --> 01:08:33.361]  The first time it was about 2006 and they caught the Pentagon
[01:08:38.322 --> 01:08:52.649]  Through the Intel Center run by Rumsfeld, uploading Adam Gadon, the grandson of the head of the ADL at the time, who'd been arrested and stuff for beating up Muslims.
[01:08:52.649 --> 01:08:56.491]  He was then supposedly number two in Al-Qaeda.
[01:08:56.491 --> 01:09:00.193]  And Lex Luthor works for Superman or vice versa.
[01:09:00.193 --> 01:09:04.555]  And they uploaded the Al-Qaeda bug in the same Pentagon bug.
[01:09:05.461 --> 01:09:10.486]  And Wired Magazine at a big tech conference exposed it as fake.
[01:09:10.486 --> 01:09:14.270]  Now any idiot could look at it and see it was produced and totally fake.
[01:09:14.270 --> 01:09:26.722]  It's kind of like there are over 500 legitimate militia groups in this country and I saw Atari militia out of Michigan a few years ago and I could see how the video was shot and what they were saying.
[01:09:28.217 --> 01:09:31.660]  With a guy standing behind the leader wearing a gas mask.
[01:09:31.660 --> 01:09:36.384]  And I said, that is out of central casting to set up this militia.
[01:09:36.384 --> 01:09:39.227]  It's run by feds, I can tell you right now.
[01:09:39.227 --> 01:09:43.650]  They're going to probably set them up.
[01:09:43.650 --> 01:09:51.717]  And the feds got scared because I blew their operation, jumped too fast, and indicted the leader and others for simply saying that there's a UN takeover.
[01:09:52.850 --> 01:09:56.411]  They might have to work with the local government to fend off a U.N.
[01:09:56.411 --> 01:09:57.532]  takeover.
[01:09:57.532 --> 01:09:59.613]  And they called that planning to overthrow the U.S.
[01:09:59.613 --> 01:10:06.476]  government and plan to kill police, and the federal judge finally ordered them released after three years.
[01:10:06.476 --> 01:10:13.558]  So, I mean, I know something's fake when I see it, but there's a new article and video up on Infowars.com.
[01:10:13.558 --> 01:10:19.481]  Son of Hollywood director has now been caught
[01:10:21.036 --> 01:10:22.497]  In these new films.
[01:10:22.497 --> 01:10:25.979]  I mean, it's just totally and completely fake.
[01:10:25.979 --> 01:10:29.061]  Here's a little newsflash.
[01:10:29.061 --> 01:10:39.867]  Al Qaeda and ISIS aren't seven and a half feet tall like those Kubrick level, you know, quality shots by the Dead Sea.
[01:10:39.867 --> 01:10:44.229]  And it shows seven and a half foot tall men chopping people's heads off.
[01:10:44.229 --> 01:10:44.990]  It's just not real.
[01:10:46.206 --> 01:10:57.212]  British son of Hollywood movie director 26 is revealed as bloodthirsty star of Al Qaeda propaganda videos after converting from Catholicism and smuggling himself to Syria.
[01:10:57.212 --> 01:11:01.755]  He didn't convert from Jack Diddley Squad.
[01:11:01.755 --> 01:11:08.119]  He's got a job as a director with the CIA.
[01:11:08.119 --> 01:11:12.101]  So that's the type of news we've got here.
[01:11:12.101 --> 01:11:15.183]  Just to get into how ridiculously fake all of this is,
[01:11:18.715 --> 01:11:27.977]  We have Martin Armstrong, the forecaster, who predicted the 87 crash, predicted other major crashes, predicted some of the biggest bull markets.
[01:11:27.977 --> 01:11:29.197]  He's on record.
[01:11:29.197 --> 01:11:33.478]  He was in the CNBC, Wall Street Journal, New York Times at the time.
[01:11:33.478 --> 01:11:48.241]  He wouldn't give his algorithm up to the feds, whether that algorithm was dead reckoning, looking at graphs, and was his own idiot savant mind, not saying he's an idiot savant, or whether he really hid the algorithm from them.
[01:11:50.592 --> 01:11:52.274]  is a non-issue.
[01:11:52.274 --> 01:11:57.079]  He was a political prisoner.
[01:11:57.079 --> 01:12:05.127]  So he will be joining us in the third hour today.
[01:12:05.127 --> 01:12:13.596]  And he certainly understands what socialism is versus capitalism and what Bernie Sanders is trying to do with his major push.
[01:12:15.109 --> 01:12:18.130]  So that is coming up today.
[01:12:18.130 --> 01:12:29.392]  The toll-free number to join us, if you'd like to talk about Hillary, saying that she wants to try to organize a move to have Australian nationwide gun bans of everything down to single shot.
[01:12:29.392 --> 01:12:30.432]  Are you concerned about that?
[01:12:30.432 --> 01:12:31.552]  Are you going to speak out against that?
[01:12:31.552 --> 01:12:33.272]  We're going to be breaking that down.
[01:12:33.272 --> 01:12:34.532]  The toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[01:12:34.532 --> 01:12:34.592]  800-259-9231.
[01:12:34.592 --> 01:12:35.093]  Specifically, though,
[01:12:44.562 --> 01:12:49.203]  On the Second Amendment, I want to take some calls on that front and that front only.
[01:12:49.203 --> 01:12:57.484]  I mean, if you want to get into social media making millennials less social, I'd like to hear from you on that.
[01:12:57.484 --> 01:13:02.845]  Or social skills are last line of defense for humans seeking work.
[01:13:02.845 --> 01:13:08.286]  That's like Bloomberg having a headline, you know, inhale oxygen into your lungs or you will die.
[01:13:08.286 --> 01:13:12.347]  But the average person thinks the more arrogant, the more conceited,
[01:13:13.700 --> 01:13:22.663]  The more petulant they are, that they're going to get ahead in life because that got them ahead, at least in their own mind, in high school.
[01:13:22.663 --> 01:13:30.725]  But first, let's go to the trailer for the hit film that we're going to be reviewing and discussing in the third hour, The Forecaster.
[01:13:30.725 --> 01:13:34.206]  Here it is.
[01:13:34.206 --> 01:13:37.527]  It starts in August of 1999.
[01:13:37.527 --> 01:13:39.708]  Yeltsin's going to run for election in 2000.
[01:13:42.093 --> 01:13:48.737]  They get Yeltsin to take $7 billion from the IMF loans.
[01:13:48.737 --> 01:13:57.201]  Now they threaten Yeltsin, you're not going to run for election in 2000, otherwise all this is going to come out that you stole $7 billion from the IMF.
[01:13:57.201 --> 01:14:01.724]  This is how Putin gets in.
[01:14:10.987 --> 01:14:13.209]  We all know something is wrong.
[01:14:13.209 --> 01:14:19.573]  The reason we have this crisis is because since World War II, they basically borrowed year after year.
[01:14:19.573 --> 01:14:21.034]  He didn't want to go to college.
[01:14:21.034 --> 01:14:22.856]  His father said, you gotta do something.
[01:14:22.856 --> 01:14:25.898]  So he enrolled him in the RCA computer store.
[01:14:26.098 --> 01:14:31.803]  I thought I could create a system that stores the knowledge of centuries to predict the future.
[01:14:31.803 --> 01:14:37.647]  The entire trading community would scramble to see the signals as soon as they were released.
[01:14:37.647 --> 01:14:41.591]  He predicted the top in the Nikkei Index.
[01:14:41.591 --> 01:14:45.314]  Universal Bank of Lebanon says, listen, could you make a model?
[01:14:45.314 --> 01:14:49.197]  And the computer says, your country is going to completely fall apart in eight days.
[01:14:49.677 --> 01:14:52.138]  Obviously, that prediction was correct.
[01:14:52.138 --> 01:14:57.700]  They realized that the model could forecast the rise or fall of a nation.
[01:14:57.700 --> 01:15:00.502]  They wanted that source code, which is text.
[01:15:00.502 --> 01:15:01.902]  We want the source code.
[01:15:01.902 --> 01:15:05.624]  I said, I'm not getting it.
[01:15:05.624 --> 01:15:05.904]  Sorry.
[01:15:08.587 --> 01:15:12.449]  The government came in, they shut down everything, seized all the accounts.
[01:15:12.449 --> 01:15:16.171]  I had friends, they said we put up the money, in cash, tonight.
[01:15:16.171 --> 01:15:18.292]  He's held with the worst of the worst.
[01:15:18.292 --> 01:15:24.276]  He wasn't backing down, and, uh, didn't seem like they were either.
[01:15:24.276 --> 01:15:29.719]  And he said to his mom, they want what I've spent my entire life developing, and I'm not giving it to them.
[01:15:41.460 --> 01:15:43.142]  It'll be the second time he's visited us.
[01:15:43.142 --> 01:15:53.991]  He's coming on to give us his breakdown on current developments, what he thinks is going to be happening in the markets in the third hour, about 45 minutes from now.
[01:15:53.991 --> 01:16:05.781]  I've got Joe Biggs and Josh Owens popping in to talk about a year and a half ago and then again a year ago when they traveled up to Chicago to cover the Holman Square
[01:16:08.484 --> 01:16:24.758]  FEMA camp substation and now it's become big news in the United States and England so we're going to break some of that down with them for about 10 minutes and then I will go to your phone calls.
[01:16:24.758 --> 01:16:31.263]  And towards the end of the hour I'm going to get to this key piece of news that I've already talked about some but it's just such a big deal.
[01:16:31.263 --> 01:16:34.666]  Social skills are last line of defense for humans seeking work.
[01:16:35.819 --> 01:16:43.343]  See, first they get rid of the industrial economy, the agrarian economy, the local economy, by design, not with free market.
[01:16:43.343 --> 01:16:45.004]  But by rigging the economy on record.
[01:16:45.004 --> 01:16:47.205]  That's even in the Financial Times of London today.
[01:16:47.205 --> 01:16:49.947]  They admit that in a crony capitalism article.
[01:16:49.947 --> 01:16:55.510]  And then they get rid of the service jobs.
[01:16:55.510 --> 01:17:00.252]  And they've societally gotten rid of the communication skills as well.
[01:17:00.252 --> 01:17:03.154]  And parents have also let their kids be raised by the television.
[01:17:03.154 --> 01:17:04.655]  It is a perfect storm.
[01:17:07.472 --> 01:17:23.257]  And either young people are either incredibly awake and involved or they are these greedy, hateful zombies who have no empathy and think violence is funny, even when it's happening to their own family.
[01:17:23.257 --> 01:17:25.718]  They're basically gone.
[01:17:25.718 --> 01:17:27.779]  They're gone.
[01:17:27.779 --> 01:17:29.139]  They were never there.
[01:17:29.139 --> 01:17:30.600]  Their brains are wired different.
[01:17:30.600 --> 01:17:32.080]  Their IQs are low.
[01:17:32.080 --> 01:17:34.161]  Their language skills are low.
[01:17:34.161 --> 01:17:35.401]  They don't have any common sense.
[01:17:35.401 --> 01:17:36.422]  They don't have empathy.
[01:17:36.422 --> 01:17:36.882]  They're gone.
[01:17:38.922 --> 01:17:40.363]  And that's what they've set us up for.
[01:17:40.363 --> 01:17:48.130]  We'll already be gone, and psychologically on average extinct, spiritually extinct, when the machines take over.
[01:17:48.130 --> 01:17:52.954]  And here's the headline, Samsung to make robot cheaper than any human worker.
[01:17:52.954 --> 01:17:56.316]  Let's go to Brandon in FEMA Region 3.
[01:17:56.316 --> 01:17:58.778]  What former state are you now in, sir, under FEMA 3?
[01:17:58.778 --> 01:18:02.922]  Virginia, George Washington country.
[01:18:04.471 --> 01:18:10.194]  I wanted to start off by getting into some good news on the gun front as well as the drug war front.
[01:18:10.194 --> 01:18:11.094]  There's a bill in Virginia
[01:18:26.149 --> 01:18:31.454]  House of Representatives to actually allow open carry without a concealed carry permit.
[01:18:31.454 --> 01:18:33.916]  In several states the laws have just gone in this month.
[01:18:33.916 --> 01:18:38.500]  Yeah, it's really happening and the criminals have less and less areas to feed on people.
[01:18:38.500 --> 01:18:41.262]  The happy hunting grounds are very small now.
[01:18:41.262 --> 01:18:46.567]  Areas of Maryland, areas of Illinois, areas of New York, areas around DC.
[01:18:46.567 --> 01:18:48.409]  There's not a lot of happy hunting ground now, is there?
[01:18:49.999 --> 01:19:06.190]  And I also wanted to tell you that I went to a state council meeting about a week ago and there's actually been a lot of uproar about getting rid of civil asset forfeiture seizure laws because of the phony drug war when it's come out on record that the CIA runs the drugs and Wall Street launders the money.
[01:19:06.190 --> 01:19:17.018]  And so it looks like we may actually be gaining some ground on getting rid of civil asset forfeiture, which is completely unconstitutional.
[01:19:18.124 --> 01:19:25.386]  And Gary Webb helped expose it and now it's just done at the federal level by the FBI and all these other agencies.
[01:19:25.386 --> 01:19:38.328]  But I wanted to actually get your opinion on what you think is the solution to getting rid of the drug war as well as all these other criminal operations that are used to take our freedoms.
[01:19:38.328 --> 01:19:40.469]  Well, you know, it's funny you say that because
[01:19:41.383 --> 01:19:43.345]  I was just about to talk about that today.
[01:19:43.345 --> 01:19:58.577]  Richard Branson of Virgin Atlantic Brands has come out as a UN envoy and says they're going to soon announce global decriminalization of all drugs, says Richard Branson.
[01:19:58.577 --> 01:20:06.464]  And I want to break down, that's in the Independent today, and I appreciate your call, exactly what's happening.
[01:20:09.444 --> 01:20:35.363]  A, they know worldwide the people of the planet have turned against the phony drug wars and realize it's only used to keep the price up and to be able to incarcerate large numbers of non-violent offenders who make very good workers for 25 cents an hour in prison industries, driving down the overall outside wage further than even illegal aliens can.
[01:20:38.564 --> 01:20:50.696]  They also, the elite, have gotten scared by drug cartels they can't control and the trillion dollars a year worldwide in drug purchases, 500 billion a year of which is just in the United States.
[01:20:50.696 --> 01:20:52.939]  We use half the world's illegal drugs.
[01:20:52.939 --> 01:20:55.581]  Look it up.
[01:20:55.581 --> 01:21:01.668]  And so they want to segue into quasi-legalizing it to control it and tax it.
[01:21:03.490 --> 01:21:10.853]  But they're still going to allow a smaller underground black market, which they will control.
[01:21:10.853 --> 01:21:31.803]  And so they're going to have a synthesis, a dialectic of the two meshed over the next 20 years as they completely phase out illegal drugs and move into psychotropic, hallucinogenic, and other designer drugs that will, for all intents and purposes, end free will as we know it.
[01:21:32.566 --> 01:21:35.908]  It'll make ecstasy or PCP look like child's play.
[01:21:35.908 --> 01:21:37.208]  Stuff already out there.
[01:21:37.208 --> 01:21:40.710]  Being tested on the military.
[01:21:40.710 --> 01:21:44.272]  Suicide pills where you feel like you're in heaven for 12 hours and then just die.
[01:21:44.272 --> 01:21:47.213]  I mean, just hell on earth is already being released.
[01:21:47.213 --> 01:21:49.835]  Already being tested.
[01:21:49.835 --> 01:21:54.237]  But the globalists or social engineers, they do all this very, very slowly.
[01:21:54.237 --> 01:21:55.477]  But here's the big secret.
[01:21:55.477 --> 01:21:56.918]  They always knew this was going to happen.
[01:21:56.918 --> 01:21:58.319]  They wrote big white papers on it in the 50s.
[01:22:01.340 --> 01:22:28.194]  Once they've broken up the family, once they've federalized the local police, once they've internationalized the federal government, and once they've phased out the official drug war, they're going to simply move on and use the giant apparatus of federalized local police that get about half their funding on average in many cities and counties and jurisdictions from asset forfeiture seizure
[01:22:29.158 --> 01:22:34.381]  They're going to make Asset Forfeiture Seizure about Agenda 21 zoning.
[01:22:34.381 --> 01:22:38.544]  So you'll have your home taken if your seven-year-old drops a battery in the grass.
[01:22:38.544 --> 01:22:48.250]  Your neighbor will get 20% of the arrest fee and the fines for discovering that.
[01:22:48.250 --> 01:22:55.915]  If you burn a cook stove out on your Mac 40, you will be SWAT teamed and be sent to prison for, you know, five, six years and will be charged $100,000.
[01:22:55.915 --> 01:22:58.317]  I mean, this is the admitted plan.
[01:22:59.673 --> 01:23:12.380]  So they're going to replace the whole phony drug war and all the addicted police on all that dirty drug money with now the green police and the family police and the vaccine police.
[01:23:12.380 --> 01:23:16.783]  So they trained them on the drug war, knowing conservatives would go along with the police state.
[01:23:17.688 --> 01:23:26.034]  In the name of fighting the drug culture, which has a lot of problems in it, is the seedy underbelly, it's what criminals get into, so it is really bad news.
[01:23:26.034 --> 01:23:32.078]  So the Law & Order folks bid on that with Nixon, Reagan, right through to Obama today.
[01:23:32.078 --> 01:23:42.885]  That'll be slowly phased out, but weaning the federalized local police onto new milk mammaries, new supplies.
[01:23:45.566 --> 01:23:57.651]  And the new blood supply, because it's not really milk, it's blood, is going to be going after the designer drugs, going after counterfeit sports memorabilia.
[01:23:57.651 --> 01:24:05.675]  I mean, you name it, it's a whole spectrum of stuff, but mainly it's environmental green police who are all arming to the teeth right now.
[01:24:05.675 --> 01:24:11.838]  It'll be auxiliaries and it's going to be, let's not exaggerate, probably five times worse than the, you think the drug war is bad?
[01:24:13.237 --> 01:24:15.238]  They're going to find something in your house.
[01:24:15.238 --> 01:24:17.099]  They're going to find something in your walls.
[01:24:17.099 --> 01:24:19.140]  They're going to find something in your paint.
[01:24:19.140 --> 01:24:20.480]  Remember the headline a few years ago?
[01:24:20.480 --> 01:24:25.683]  $15 million fine for garage sale?
[01:24:25.683 --> 01:24:28.944]  That's Associated Press, Fox News headline.
[01:24:28.944 --> 01:24:30.305]  Type it in.
[01:24:30.305 --> 01:24:34.287]  $15 million fine, and that's on the books now.
[01:24:34.287 --> 01:24:37.568]  It was on the books to take blood from you when you get a driver's license.
[01:24:37.568 --> 01:24:41.290]  I put that in my first film in 1997, America Destroyed by Design.
[01:24:42.529 --> 01:24:53.677]  And just now, in District of Columbia and in one other state, are they starting random blood taking when you get a driver's license?
[01:24:53.677 --> 01:24:54.377]  And there it is.
[01:24:54.377 --> 01:24:59.781]  New government policy, not a law, imposes strict standards on garage sales.
[01:24:59.781 --> 01:25:04.825]  $15 million fine.
[01:25:04.825 --> 01:25:08.267]  $1 million on your first offense, $15 million on your second.
[01:25:08.267 --> 01:25:10.208]  You go, well what, is it banning them?
[01:25:10.208 --> 01:25:10.749]  Essentially.
[01:25:12.284 --> 01:25:27.617]  They go back more than 40 years with a computer that scans your goods, and if anything was ever recalled at factory level or store level, and you're reselling it, you didn't know that Barbie doll was recalled, because the head comes off in babies' mouths.
[01:25:27.617 --> 01:25:31.059]  You didn't know that paint you were selling from 10 years ago was recalled.
[01:25:31.059 --> 01:25:35.023]  You didn't know the painting you were selling had recalled oil paint.
[01:25:35.023 --> 01:25:36.224]  There will be no mercy.
[01:25:37.955 --> 01:25:43.097]  And so that's why now the new police are all leftist, and they're building a perfect world.
[01:25:43.097 --> 01:25:49.639]  So, they're letting us win the fight against the phony drug war.
[01:25:49.639 --> 01:26:05.544]  To segue into Agenda 21, which micromanages every facet of human life, from gardening, to agrarian, to small shops, to auto parts and auto repair, to just the entire economy.
[01:26:06.494 --> 01:26:19.717]  Australia already has it, where they actually SWAT team your house under the law if you didn't put in the, quote, vinyl siding you were supposed to, or the caulk in the window seals.
[01:26:19.717 --> 01:26:21.617]  And people say, well, that does hurt our energy.
[01:26:21.617 --> 01:26:22.177]  You should.
[01:26:22.177 --> 01:26:24.398]  But see how it sets that precedent.
[01:26:24.398 --> 01:26:27.719]  And remember the Green Police ad five years ago during the Super Bowl.
[01:26:27.719 --> 01:26:29.359]  I told you that was what they're going to really do.
[01:26:29.359 --> 01:26:34.120]  And then a year later, the mayor of San Francisco said they helped produce it with the feds, with Audi.
[01:26:35.293 --> 01:26:42.259]  And that this was meant to prepare you to be arrested if you took too hot a bath or had the wrong light bulb.
[01:26:42.259 --> 01:26:45.362]  They're not playing games.
[01:26:45.362 --> 01:26:49.405]  Their carbon cuts alone will kill a billion people in the third world the first decade.
[01:26:49.405 --> 01:26:52.848]  They're coming.
[01:26:52.848 --> 01:26:57.011]  So, you need to understand that
[01:26:58.126 --> 01:27:03.188]  I don't know of anyone else who understands this like I do, and that's a very lonely place to be.
[01:27:03.188 --> 01:27:20.595]  No one else understands they're getting rid of the drug war to segue it into the new Green Police carbon tax system, the inoculation medical police, that they're still going to take your kids when they blood test you, when you're having a baby, if you've got anything in you, even a legal prescription.
[01:27:20.595 --> 01:27:23.556]  I mean, it's going to be worse than it ever was.
[01:27:23.556 --> 01:27:25.897]  The prison population is only going to get much bigger now.
[01:27:27.130 --> 01:27:39.118]  But who they want to institutionalize is families that have been maybe 50 generations not in prison, 50 generations genetically not committing crime, generation over generation building.
[01:27:39.118 --> 01:27:51.307]  They want to break that in the epigenetics and they want to put you spiritually in a 10 by 8 cell if you're lucky.
[01:27:53.192 --> 01:27:58.754]  and break your will and spiritually feed off innocent people in dungeons.
[01:27:58.754 --> 01:28:03.196]  Their religion is about taking small children and raping them.
[01:28:03.196 --> 01:28:07.098]  Their religion is about putting you in solitary confinement for no reason.
[01:28:07.098 --> 01:28:11.500]  Their religion is about dominating the human spirit and hurting it.
[01:28:12.782 --> 01:28:18.649]  See, psychopaths, when they grab a woman or a child, they like women and children because they tend to grovel more and there's a power trip.
[01:28:18.649 --> 01:28:25.978]  Most psychopaths, most serial killers don't like to kill men because men will start flopping around screaming and biting their tongue off and not caring.
[01:28:25.978 --> 01:28:27.840]  They'll beg a little, but not too long.
[01:28:29.580 --> 01:28:33.402]  Until they start cursing you to hell and things, and psychopaths don't like that.
[01:28:33.402 --> 01:28:42.946]  They like about a three-year-old that'll beg and sob for about 12 hours a day, and they just sit there in the dark, wearing devil masks, torturing the baby because they are feeding on it.
[01:28:42.946 --> 01:28:46.087]  And they will feed on you and your family because you let them.
[01:28:46.087 --> 01:28:47.348]  And they're gonna hurt you real bad.
[01:28:48.629 --> 01:28:56.841]  But they can't get you and your children, you know, on a regular basis down in a dungeon to have, you know, to torture you until the baby finally gives up.
[01:28:56.841 --> 01:29:01.288]  Those in a catatonic state, they call it using it up as a three-year-old.
[01:29:01.288 --> 01:29:03.651]  Or, you know, ten-year-old girl or five-year-old boy.
[01:29:04.520 --> 01:29:07.503]  They can usually torture women better and terrorize them better.
[01:29:07.503 --> 01:29:12.087]  So again, women's the favorite.
[01:29:12.087 --> 01:29:18.052]  And so on a mass scale, they want to do this and really take their time with you women, so the government's there to help you.
[01:29:18.052 --> 01:29:21.915]  And they're going to give you all the shots, all the medicine to make sure they kill you real slow.
[01:29:21.915 --> 01:29:23.637]  They're going to make sure they screw you up.
[01:29:23.637 --> 01:29:26.039]  If you have a kid, it's going to be brain damaged.
[01:29:26.039 --> 01:29:28.081]  All the rodents they test this on have that, of course, 99%.
[01:29:29.822 --> 01:29:35.267]  And they just want to make sure they hurt you real long and real slow and take their time using you up.
[01:29:35.267 --> 01:29:42.473]  And then when they're done, they'll incinerate your body and heat the hospital with the heat from it, as they now do in America.
[01:29:42.473 --> 01:29:45.015]  And then they'll all sit there and laugh at you while they murder you.
[01:29:45.015 --> 01:29:48.157]  So, I just thought you might want to know what they're planning next with the system.
[01:29:48.157 --> 01:29:49.538]  We're on the march.
[01:29:49.538 --> 01:29:52.081]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:52.081 --> 01:29:54.763]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:58.874 --> 01:30:00.974]  Kit Daniels, Infowars.com.
[01:30:00.974 --> 01:30:06.096]  Did you know that since 1960, the number of married adults has decreased from 72% down to 51?
[01:30:06.096 --> 01:30:09.136]  In other words, barely half of all adults in the U.S.
[01:30:09.136 --> 01:30:11.017]  are married, which is a record low.
[01:30:11.017 --> 01:30:17.638]  Case in point, a Catholic pastor recently revealed he's only performing five marriages a year, down from 35 over 25 years ago.
[01:30:17.638 --> 01:30:20.799]  And the pastor, Charles Pope, said other priests have had similar experiences.
[01:30:20.799 --> 01:30:24.500]  But why are men shying away from marriage and even relationships with women in general?
[01:30:24.500 --> 01:30:26.200]  Well, Pastor Pope pointed out the obvious.
[01:30:26.460 --> 01:30:30.262]  Radical feminism is destroying marriage by driving a wedge between men and women.
[01:30:30.262 --> 01:30:38.486]  For one thing, thanks to feminism, many men are now so terrified of being labeled rapists that they shy away from showing any interest towards women, even women who hate feminism.
[01:30:38.486 --> 01:30:42.988]  And because of that, many women now complain they cannot find real men who have the confidence to approach them.
[01:30:43.188 --> 01:30:48.172]  There's a video report on InfoWars.com entitled, Why Men Are Giving Up on Marriage, which breaks it all down.
[01:30:48.172 --> 01:30:51.995]  And you can also find the video on our new YouTube channel called Resistance News.
[01:30:51.995 --> 01:30:58.241]  Once again, this is Kit Daniels with InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.TV, and keep checking back for more news and reports.
[01:30:58.701 --> 01:31:04.448]  Your liver can be full of fatty deposits, built-up toxins, and even dangerous objects known as liver stones.
[01:31:04.448 --> 01:31:18.884]  We worked with the top developers in the field of detox to take tried and true herbs and other compounds known to safely cleanse the liver and infuse it with the latest research and technological development on concentrating these ingredients to give you the maximum effect.
[01:31:19.144 --> 01:31:27.151]  Liver Shield is the only liver support product on the market that uses a patented Spigerex blend of powerful organic herbs that support detoxification.
[01:31:27.151 --> 01:31:32.576]  And when you visit InfoWarsLife.com, see the instructional video on how to do a six-day liver detox.
[01:31:32.576 --> 01:31:36.279]  This isn't a game, and let me tell you, the results are dramatic.
[01:31:36.279 --> 01:31:40.423]  Liver Shield is totally organic and made of the safest, high-quality herbs.
[01:31:40.423 --> 01:31:44.287]  But that said, you need to consult your physician before you do the full detox.
[01:31:44.727 --> 01:31:48.851]  Liver Shield can also be used daily by itself for overall upkeep of the liver.
[01:31:48.851 --> 01:31:53.915]  Secure your Liver Shield today exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com for the lowest price available.
[01:31:53.915 --> 01:31:57.258]  That's InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[01:31:57.258 --> 01:32:01.942]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[01:32:01.942 --> 01:32:06.746]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors,
[01:32:06.826 --> 01:32:07.206]  We're good.
[01:32:28.286 --> 01:32:29.387]  BrainForce is here.
[01:32:29.387 --> 01:32:31.609]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[01:32:31.609 --> 01:32:36.593]  You probably noticed I've been more focused, less brain fog, more energy, and it's because of BrainForce.
[01:32:36.593 --> 01:32:39.875]  There's always hidden additives in your food, even organic food has hidden additives.
[01:32:39.875 --> 01:32:43.378]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[01:32:43.378 --> 01:32:45.360]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[01:32:45.360 --> 01:32:49.463]  It doesn't have stimulants, it doesn't have garbage in it, it has natural things that do it clean.
[01:32:49.463 --> 01:32:55.068]  You will find BrainForce and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[01:33:14.411 --> 01:33:20.094]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[01:33:20.094 --> 01:33:24.717]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:24.717 --> 01:33:26.558]  My guests are going to leave us here in about 10 minutes.
[01:33:26.558 --> 01:33:34.802]  We're going to go to Eric, Woody, Drake, John and others that are patiently holding.
[01:33:34.802 --> 01:33:43.847]  Every few months I use the criminology parallel of what psychopaths do with women and children that they torture for enjoyment.
[01:33:46.977 --> 01:33:52.420]  As an example of what the elite are doing on a wider scale.
[01:33:52.420 --> 01:33:56.162]  In World War II, over 100 million people died total.
[01:33:56.162 --> 01:33:58.083]  The vast majority civilians.
[01:33:58.083 --> 01:34:05.868]  So no matter how horrific something I talk about is, the reality of it is truly far worse.
[01:34:05.868 --> 01:34:07.869]  So I believe what I'm saying and I can prove it.
[01:34:10.120 --> 01:34:21.577]  And when I get into all these examples of what they want to do to you and your family at the top, it's all done through compartmentalization where 99% of the people carrying it out don't know what they're part of.
[01:34:23.353 --> 01:34:45.286]  But there is a mass rollout of indefinite detention under the NDAA, of citizens being disappeared, and Homeland Security is gearing up saying the new big push and the new main national security strategy is to prepare for a war with returning veterans, veterans, gun owners, conservatives, libertarians, and Christians.
[01:34:45.286 --> 01:34:51.210]  We have given you five of the eight secret memos that have been leaked in the last seven years.
[01:34:51.210 --> 01:34:52.791]  We have broken them first.
[01:34:53.703 --> 01:34:54.604]  On record.
[01:34:54.604 --> 01:34:57.646]  We're not bragging, just we know what we're talking about.
[01:34:57.646 --> 01:35:15.500]  And now they've announced a new brigade homeland to interface with the new Justice Department secret police run by the Southern Poverty Law Center, an extremely wicked organization, to target said groups in a new war.
[01:35:15.500 --> 01:35:19.963]  So they're moving into a much larger operational phase now.
[01:35:19.963 --> 01:35:20.744]  You need to know about it.
[01:35:21.917 --> 01:35:36.992]  Exposing it may allow us to back them off, but when I see a story like Home Square, Home and Square revealed how Chicago police disappeared 7,000 people, London Guardian.
[01:35:36.992 --> 01:35:39.575]  Well, we were there last year, Joe Biggs and Josh Owens.
[01:35:39.575 --> 01:35:41.557]  We're going to give you the rest of the story.
[01:35:43.697 --> 01:35:55.501]  Because this is only a training center to prepare police, who have been sent there nationwide to be trained, how to disappear people in the next phase for good.
[01:35:55.501 --> 01:36:00.702]  So, when I say, let's not just fight with the police, that's because that's meant to make them become federalized.
[01:36:00.702 --> 01:36:07.024]  We need to, though, show this is going on under the feds, who are behind it.
[01:36:07.024 --> 01:36:08.445]  They're not going to reform the police.
[01:36:09.824 --> 01:36:12.106]  So that's coming up in just one moment with our guest.
[01:36:12.106 --> 01:36:23.673]  Before we go any further, they were pointing out, hey, you might want to add what herbal immune booster is 15% off just this week, and that's Ancient Defense.
[01:36:23.673 --> 01:36:28.357]  So 15% off Ancient Defense, we have a limited supply of that.
[01:36:29.400 --> 01:36:32.021]  This is what you take in the fall and winter.
[01:36:32.021 --> 01:36:40.166]  It's got a whole bunch of ingredients and things like concentrated elderberry and a whole bunch of other stuff known to boost immunity and overall health, and it tastes great.
[01:36:40.166 --> 01:36:41.487]  It's great to give your children.
[01:36:41.487 --> 01:36:44.208]  That's what I do, and your person supports the broadcast.
[01:36:44.208 --> 01:36:50.292]  We have 10% off InfoWars Select, super high quality, storable foods.
[01:36:51.292 --> 01:36:56.955]  It's My Patriot Supply, private label by us, so that we can discount even more than anyone else can.
[01:36:56.955 --> 01:36:58.976]  And you get free shipping.
[01:36:58.976 --> 01:37:08.021]  That is such a huge deal when you're talking about storable foods because much of the cost, sometimes half the cost of storable food is the shipping.
[01:37:08.021 --> 01:37:13.764]  It's all produced, grown, packaged right here in America, obviously in Utah, the experts on it.
[01:37:13.764 --> 01:37:19.067]  Infowarsstore.com or Infowarsselect.com to find that subpage.
[01:37:19.067 --> 01:37:19.607]  And finally,
[01:37:21.311 --> 01:37:22.799]  Can?
[01:37:22.799 --> 01:37:23.000]  That's...
[01:37:24.758 --> 01:37:30.820]  10% off and free shipping on the ProPure G2 systems and other systems at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:37:30.820 --> 01:37:40.002]  And again, if you go to InfoWarsStore.com, you'll find InfoWarsSelect.com, you'll find InfoWarsLife.com, all linked there on that shopping cart.
[01:37:40.002 --> 01:37:52.605]  It's all one URL, but if you want to go right to the storable foods, InfoWarsSelect.com, right to the nutraceuticals, InfoWarsLife.com, and there's a bunch of other specials we're running as well that end in just a few days.
[01:37:53.345 --> 01:37:54.606]  They end on Wednesday.
[01:37:54.606 --> 01:37:58.049]  I'm thinking about extending them but probably won't extend some of them.
[01:37:58.049 --> 01:38:00.832]  I've got to make those decisions when I get off air today.
[01:38:00.832 --> 01:38:06.177]  So take advantage of that now and know you're funding the very tip of the spear in the fight against the globalists.
[01:38:06.177 --> 01:38:18.669]  I take a sincere pleasure in the fact that we have sold a huge amount of Hillary for prison shirts and that we can fund in the last three months
[01:38:19.938 --> 01:38:31.444]  A large part of our operation off of a good, high-quality shirt that causes debate, that causes discussion, that's hardcore political free speech, to exercise that so we don't lose it.
[01:38:31.444 --> 01:38:41.290]  A win-win, and Joe Biggs, by the way, has really helped in publicity stunts that he's pulled, which we admit we've done, he's just done it instinctively, at Donald Trump and Hillary events.
[01:38:43.578 --> 01:38:45.680]  He has helped get those out to so many people.
[01:38:45.680 --> 01:38:47.541]  So great job Joe Biggs.
[01:38:47.541 --> 01:38:49.023]  We're only going to sell those.
[01:38:49.023 --> 01:38:51.825]  They have a 4.9 rating of a possible 5 stars.
[01:38:51.825 --> 01:38:53.086]  Unprecedented rating.
[01:38:53.086 --> 01:38:53.827]  Third party rating.
[01:38:53.827 --> 01:38:57.770]  4.9 rating for Hillary for prison 2016.
[01:38:57.770 --> 01:39:00.012]  On the back it says Infowars.com.
[01:39:00.012 --> 01:39:01.113]  Legalized freedom.
[01:39:01.113 --> 01:39:02.874]  We're only going to sell these through December 18th.
[01:39:04.790 --> 01:39:06.671]  Just like I did the Obama Joker shirt.
[01:39:06.671 --> 01:39:08.272]  People couldn't believe it when that stopped.
[01:39:08.272 --> 01:39:10.233]  We did a new design, but that wasn't a classic.
[01:39:10.233 --> 01:39:17.736]  I kind of wish I hadn't done that, but it's available at InfowarsStore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:39:17.736 --> 01:39:27.381]  Now, when we put this up on YouTube and Facebook, I want to just put my intro, and I want to go ahead and just put that plug right in the middle.
[01:39:27.381 --> 01:39:34.264]  I don't want to cut the plugs out because those are so important, and I want to just segue right in to what I'm about to cover right now as we broadcast live.
[01:39:35.720 --> 01:39:42.704]  Homan Square revealed how Chicago police disappeared 7,000 people.
[01:39:42.704 --> 01:39:44.365]  And then I have here a folder
[01:39:45.362 --> 01:39:56.849]  Of about, let's not exaggerate, probably 30-40 articles that most of them are info wars, but we link to army.mil, we link to Associated Press, we link to Washington Post, we link to Army Times.
[01:39:56.849 --> 01:40:07.796]  And I say that because they have hit piece articles that the White House runs at Media Matters, Newsweek, Time Magazine routinely saying Jones backs up his assertions with his own website.
[01:40:07.796 --> 01:40:12.099]  Now, they're preying on their moron readers.
[01:40:12.099 --> 01:40:13.240]  They've lost their real readers.
[01:40:14.394 --> 01:40:16.936]  That's why they're in free fall.
[01:40:16.936 --> 01:40:21.578]  Anyone can go to any of these articles and link through.
[01:40:21.578 --> 01:40:26.401]  DOJ training manual, extremist founding fathers would not be welcome in today's military.
[01:40:26.401 --> 01:40:28.503]  It links to the DOD website.
[01:40:28.503 --> 01:40:32.105]  Army admits re-education camp manual not intended for public release.
[01:40:32.105 --> 01:40:33.686]  We release the quasi-secret.
[01:40:33.686 --> 01:40:36.467]  I mean, do people even understand what they could probably do?
[01:40:36.467 --> 01:40:39.549]  I mean, they're already investigating me because we're releasing this stuff.
[01:40:39.549 --> 01:40:40.790]  You know what they do to whistleblowers?
[01:40:40.790 --> 01:40:42.371]  Well, we're just doing it!
[01:40:42.371 --> 01:40:43.812]  We have a right to know there's FEMA camps.
[01:40:45.165 --> 01:40:46.026]  Imagine how that'll look.
[01:40:46.026 --> 01:40:49.472]  Alex Jones arrested for releasing document on FEMA camps.
[01:40:49.472 --> 01:40:50.854]  How's that gonna look for you?
[01:40:50.854 --> 01:40:51.595]  They'll probably do it!
[01:40:51.595 --> 01:40:56.062]  Probably have a bunch of liberals on TV saying how great it is, saying, kill him!
[01:40:56.062 --> 01:40:57.064]  Gouge his eyes out!
[01:40:57.064 --> 01:40:58.105]  We're liberal!
[01:40:58.105 --> 01:40:58.907]  Arrest Snowden!
[01:41:00.726 --> 01:41:04.607]  Army admits re-education camp manual not intended for public release.
[01:41:04.607 --> 01:41:19.192]  But after we released it, they went ahead and put FM3-39.40 at army.mil interment resettlement operations where they admit they're going to break up our families, process us, take our guns, put the troublemakers in other camps.
[01:41:19.192 --> 01:41:20.272]  And here it is, FM3-39.40.
[01:41:22.674 --> 01:41:26.735]  DHS supplier provides shooting targets of American gun owners.
[01:41:26.735 --> 01:41:28.775]  Folks didn't believe that for two weeks that that was real.
[01:41:28.775 --> 01:41:33.736]  Until the public said, hey, Homeland Security asked for the posters of little kids and women.
[01:41:33.736 --> 01:41:36.617]  Think we're playing games here?
[01:41:36.617 --> 01:41:36.917]  U.S.
[01:41:36.917 --> 01:41:41.797]  troops and Homeland crowd control patrols from October 1st.
[01:41:41.797 --> 01:41:45.518]  DHS wants equipment for riot control situations.
[01:41:45.518 --> 01:41:48.499]  SEAL veteran military leaders being asked if they will disarm Americans.
[01:41:48.499 --> 01:41:49.799]  He came on the show, Benjamin Smith.
[01:41:50.600 --> 01:41:54.461]  Rex 84, FEMA's blueprint for martial law in America, congressional hearings.
[01:41:54.461 --> 01:41:56.781]  We have video of the congressional hearings.
[01:41:56.781 --> 01:41:59.602]  Yes, the re-education camp manual does apply domestically to U.S.
[01:41:59.602 --> 01:42:01.522]  citizens.
[01:42:01.522 --> 01:42:06.723]  National Guard looking for internment resettlement specialist.
[01:42:06.723 --> 01:42:09.203]  Police now armed for war against returning veterans.
[01:42:09.203 --> 01:42:13.344]  Video of multiple departments admitting it's for the patriots.
[01:42:13.344 --> 01:42:17.805]  Career jobs, Army.mil, internment resettlement in America for 3 million Americans.
[01:42:19.284 --> 01:42:19.744]  How the U.S.
[01:42:19.744 --> 01:42:21.484]  military would crush a Tea Party rebellion.
[01:42:21.484 --> 01:42:24.045]  Salon.
[01:42:24.045 --> 01:42:25.285]  This particular one's out of Forbes.
[01:42:25.285 --> 01:42:28.246]  Salon wrote a story about how great it was.
[01:42:28.246 --> 01:42:28.766]  D.O.D.
[01:42:28.766 --> 01:42:31.406]  military training to scare the crap out of people in Florida.
[01:42:31.406 --> 01:42:32.986]  That's the plan.
[01:42:32.986 --> 01:42:34.347]  Army strategic shock report.
[01:42:34.347 --> 01:42:36.047]  Troops may be needed to quell U.S.
[01:42:36.047 --> 01:42:37.907]  civil unrest.
[01:42:37.907 --> 01:42:41.968]  Homeland Security lists liberty lovers as terrorists.
[01:42:41.968 --> 01:42:42.488]  The U.S.
[01:42:42.488 --> 01:42:45.489]  Army in a time of transition.
[01:42:45.489 --> 01:42:47.309]  I'm not even going to cover any more of this, okay?
[01:42:50.256 --> 01:42:51.397]  This is what's going on.
[01:42:51.397 --> 01:42:53.359]  This is what's being prepared.
[01:42:53.359 --> 01:42:56.963]  And when you have a police department, you can say Chicago's collapsed.
[01:42:56.963 --> 01:42:58.144]  You can say it's a war.
[01:42:58.144 --> 01:42:59.045]  They've taken the guns.
[01:42:59.045 --> 01:43:00.267]  They ship the drugs in.
[01:43:00.267 --> 01:43:07.514]  Chicago distributes drugs for the entire Midwest and then into the other parts of the country because the mafia used to completely run it.
[01:43:07.514 --> 01:43:08.455]  Now the globalists run it.
[01:43:09.156 --> 01:43:11.178]  In the 70s and 80s, the U.S.
[01:43:11.178 --> 01:43:15.381]  Army cleared out the mafia with hit teams and then fully took it over for themselves.
[01:43:15.381 --> 01:43:16.541]  Believe me, I know.
[01:43:16.541 --> 01:43:19.524]  I'm just going to stop right there before I get people in trouble.
[01:43:19.524 --> 01:43:23.346]  The point is, is that it's totally run out of there.
[01:43:23.346 --> 01:43:29.931]  And then the cops go around putting gangbangers in these things until they confess without lawyers or due process, where they've also been tortured.
[01:43:29.931 --> 01:43:32.353]  They hire former torturers to run this base.
[01:43:33.916 --> 01:43:36.038]  We're going to go to Joe Biggs and our guest on this now.
[01:43:36.038 --> 01:43:44.223]  And so finally it's in the London Guardian, the Chicago Tribune, that 7,000 people were disappeared.
[01:43:44.223 --> 01:43:46.825]  And you can argue, hey, it's a tough city, blah, blah, blah.
[01:43:46.825 --> 01:43:49.027]  The point is the Feds are involved.
[01:43:49.027 --> 01:43:50.228]  The Feds are staffing it.
[01:43:50.228 --> 01:43:51.589]  The Pentagon's involved.
[01:43:51.589 --> 01:43:56.552]  They want to mainline what Joe Biggs saw in Iraq and Afghanistan with these black sites.
[01:43:56.552 --> 01:44:00.395]  So I want you to speak about what you guys saw there into the next segment.
[01:44:00.395 --> 01:44:01.236]  What you saw there,
[01:44:02.657 --> 01:44:08.006]  What you witnessed overseas and then where you see all this going.
[01:44:08.006 --> 01:44:10.690]  Josh Owens who was there doing camera work and Joe Biggs there reporting.
[01:44:10.690 --> 01:44:11.011]  Go ahead.
[01:44:11.011 --> 01:44:13.715]  Well I mean it's definitely an eerie place to be.
[01:44:13.715 --> 01:44:14.537]  I mean when you get there.
[01:44:15.592 --> 01:44:18.834]  You're looking around and you're kind of like, eh, I don't think that's really going on in there.
[01:44:18.834 --> 01:44:30.742]  But then you get a chance to start talking to people and you hear the stories, you hear the rumors of these officers literally just like throwing bags over people's heads, picking them up in these SUVs, you know, in full battle rattle.
[01:44:30.742 --> 01:44:34.104]  These guys look like they're about to, you know, storm Normandy or something.
[01:44:34.104 --> 01:44:40.609]  Taking people, throwing them in there, not letting them contact a lawyer, not letting them, you know, have any rights whatsoever.
[01:44:40.609 --> 01:44:45.272]  Essentially, a lot of these guys have said that they were held down and forced heroin.
[01:44:45.872 --> 01:44:49.074]  And different drugs, truth serums.
[01:44:49.074 --> 01:44:51.595]  We've known now time and time again from Guantanamo Bay.
[01:44:51.595 --> 01:44:52.916]  By the way, it's now confirmed.
[01:44:52.916 --> 01:44:59.459]  This is a CIA substation testing local police to prepare them to see if they'll do anything.
[01:44:59.459 --> 01:45:03.742]  But none of the torture that even worked in Guantanamo led to any intelligence whatsoever.
[01:45:03.742 --> 01:45:09.825]  What makes them think that it's going to lead to any kind of intelligence or whatever on drugs in that area?
[01:45:09.825 --> 01:45:13.187]  The funny thing is that there's a huge psychological operation happening
[01:45:14.662 --> 01:45:15.863]  In Chicago.
[01:45:15.863 --> 01:45:17.783]  Across the entire country.
[01:45:17.783 --> 01:45:21.425]  The fact that Chicago is a Democrat-run state.
[01:45:21.425 --> 01:45:23.726]  I mean, Illinois, Chicago.
[01:45:23.726 --> 01:45:25.126]  That's Obama's old place.
[01:45:25.126 --> 01:45:33.910]  Why is it that time and time again the majority of minorities continue to vote for these people who are throwing them in these places and not giving them rights?
[01:45:33.910 --> 01:45:36.171]  And yet Obama comes out and says Black Lives Matter.
[01:45:36.171 --> 01:45:41.413]  Well, Obama, if Black Lives Matter, why don't you shut down this home and square in Chicago?
[01:45:41.413 --> 01:45:44.094]  Why don't you do something about it if you actually cared?
[01:45:44.554 --> 01:45:45.655]  But you haven't done anything.
[01:45:45.655 --> 01:45:53.603]  Well, just last week, more CIA black sites got exposed in Romania, in Poland, in Germany, and now there's lawsuits over that.
[01:45:53.603 --> 01:45:55.945]  And they're not even taking real terrorists and torturing them.
[01:45:55.945 --> 01:45:57.367]  That's bad enough.
[01:45:57.367 --> 01:46:00.470]  They're taking innocent people, businessmen.
[01:46:00.470 --> 01:46:05.795]  They're now mainlining this against the populations of the world where they just disappear people.
[01:46:06.075 --> 01:46:10.459]  Yeah, they raided a store in Chicago, took a whole group of people in there, held them.
[01:46:10.459 --> 01:46:15.124]  They said that they were, you know, chained to the floor, chained to a wall nude.
[01:46:15.124 --> 01:46:15.744]  One guy had his...
[01:46:17.628 --> 01:46:20.669]  His testicles stomped on by a police officer.
[01:46:20.669 --> 01:46:22.470]  Guy said that they saw puddles of blood.
[01:46:22.470 --> 01:46:24.250]  They heard screams throughout the night.
[01:46:24.250 --> 01:46:25.631]  That's something that you hear.
[01:46:25.631 --> 01:46:28.251]  That's something that I heard personally in Afghanistan.
[01:46:28.251 --> 01:46:28.752]  That's horrible.
[01:46:28.752 --> 01:46:31.813]  That's something you would never think of hearing about here.
[01:46:31.813 --> 01:46:34.614]  But again, they even denied what happened in Afghanistan and Iraq.
[01:46:34.614 --> 01:46:35.374]  Now it's admitted.
[01:46:35.374 --> 01:46:39.375]  Widespread DEA, CIA, all of them, with feds that come back here.
[01:46:39.375 --> 01:46:41.416]  Even local SWAT teams go and train overseas.
[01:46:42.156 --> 01:46:48.582]  In this whole integration, tell people how many times you delivered folks to be tortured, and how many times you saw roughly people be killed.
[01:46:48.582 --> 01:46:51.385]  You know, dead bodies would come out afterwards.
[01:46:51.385 --> 01:46:53.687]  Well, I mean, you know, when you're out there, they lie to you.
[01:46:53.687 --> 01:46:54.548]  You don't know that at the time.
[01:46:54.548 --> 01:46:57.491]  You're kind of, you know, gung-ho thinking that you're doing American... Sure, I'm not judging you.
[01:46:58.171 --> 01:47:03.093]  Well, I mean, yeah, you know, so you're out here on a mission, you're like, alright, this is a target, this is a bad guy, we gotta go get him.
[01:47:03.093 --> 01:47:10.576]  So you go in, you have these asymmetric warfare guys, you have all these OGA guys, other government agencies, people come in and they're like, alright, we gotta get this guy.
[01:47:10.576 --> 01:47:14.037]  They take him, they take him back to a little place, and they're like, alright, stay on guard.
[01:47:15.162 --> 01:47:20.484]  They take some guys in, some guys with beards come in who don't have any kind of name tags or, you know, patches or anything like that.
[01:47:20.484 --> 01:47:21.785]  You don't know who they're with, what they're doing.
[01:47:21.785 --> 01:47:24.546]  They just go in and then you hear screams.
[01:47:24.546 --> 01:47:26.787]  Sometimes they come out, sometimes they don't.
[01:47:26.787 --> 01:47:31.429]  Sometimes, you know, the ship change happens and then you're going there again and say, hey, has this guy been pulled out yet?
[01:47:31.429 --> 01:47:33.270]  No, he's been there for at least a day now.
[01:47:33.270 --> 01:47:34.390]  Still going at it.
[01:47:34.390 --> 01:47:40.493]  You know, there's a lot of horrible stuff that happens and it's sickening to see that that stuff is carrying over here into the country.
[01:47:40.493 --> 01:47:43.354]  And you describe these as almost like medical, like a dental lab.
[01:47:44.122 --> 01:47:44.962]  Oh yeah, it was nasty.
[01:47:44.962 --> 01:47:50.805]  Like, you know, chairs and those cold metal tables where they'll kind of put you down with straps.
[01:47:50.805 --> 01:47:52.005]  Stuff like that.
[01:47:52.005 --> 01:47:57.327]  And then, come to find out, one of the guys that actually worked at Home and Square worked at Guantanamo.
[01:47:57.327 --> 01:47:58.888]  Sure, of course.
[01:47:58.888 --> 01:48:04.750]  So they're taking these tactics that you would use for hardened terrorists, and they're now using them on everyday citizens.
[01:48:05.931 --> 01:48:12.455]  Just to... I'll tell the story again, and I talked to my dad again last night over there at his house, and he told me everything for our own safety.
[01:48:12.455 --> 01:48:13.535]  I need to get it out now.
[01:48:13.535 --> 01:48:16.897]  He called him his uncle, but it was his first cousin, lived across the street, was an army officer.
[01:48:16.897 --> 01:48:23.761]  And then his son just got out of the army 35 years, and he died a year and a half ago.
[01:48:23.761 --> 01:48:27.603]  And he told my dad, because you know they play 42 and stuff and go deer hunting,
[01:48:28.905 --> 01:48:32.169]  Decades ago, he got out of the Army because he never really left the Army.
[01:48:32.169 --> 01:48:33.690]  Kind of like Buckley's dad never really left the Army.
[01:48:33.690 --> 01:48:34.431]  He went to Guatemala.
[01:48:34.431 --> 01:48:36.153]  He was still in the Army.
[01:48:36.153 --> 01:48:39.557]  And there was all these Army guys there giving speeches about it, you know, when we were at his funeral.
[01:48:39.557 --> 01:48:43.562]  And then when he continued on in the Army and everything said he was out of the Army, same deal.
[01:48:43.562 --> 01:48:45.324]  But Pat Lynn was in the Army.
[01:48:45.324 --> 01:48:46.065]  Pat Lynn Simmons.
[01:48:47.438 --> 01:48:51.440]  And they sheep dipped him in, and he just said it was totally upside down.
[01:48:51.440 --> 01:48:56.303]  He was doing stuff for the CIA, killing people, is what he told my dad.
[01:48:56.303 --> 01:49:02.547]  And he said it got so bad in Chicago, so upside down, he said it was the most horrible things you could imagine.
[01:49:02.547 --> 01:49:04.028]  And he was tough, he was mean.
[01:49:04.028 --> 01:49:06.289]  He wasn't some, I mean, who do you think they hired for this stuff?
[01:49:06.289 --> 01:49:08.110]  He was meaner than hell.
[01:49:08.110 --> 01:49:09.511]  A loving guy, but tough.
[01:49:09.511 --> 01:49:10.271]  I mean, serious.
[01:49:14.417 --> 01:49:21.003]  I mean, I remember when he cooked rabbits for dinner, he just, he wouldn't even use a paddle or whatever to break their neck, he'd just reach right in and pull their head right off, you know.
[01:49:21.003 --> 01:49:23.525]  That's the kind of guy that'd just grab a rabbit and rip the head right off.
[01:49:23.525 --> 01:49:28.049]  Not like it was a big deal, he'd just wind up rabbits and rip their heads off for dinner, you know.
[01:49:28.049 --> 01:49:32.132]  And he told my dad, he didn't tell my dad the details, but he said it was
[01:49:33.314 --> 01:49:35.296]  The most horrible stuff you could imagine.
[01:49:35.296 --> 01:49:38.560]  He said America, he knew then, was upside down.
[01:49:38.560 --> 01:49:40.862]  And Chicago's like the battleground for all this stuff.
[01:49:40.862 --> 01:49:41.903]  I'm sorry to interrupt.
[01:49:41.903 --> 01:49:42.804]  We're going to skip this break.
[01:49:42.804 --> 01:49:45.627]  Last one I'm doing this week, period, because I've got to stop now.
[01:49:45.627 --> 01:49:52.034]  But this is so important just to understand what is simmering underneath the surface of all this stuff.
[01:49:52.034 --> 01:49:52.314]  Go ahead.
[01:49:53.134 --> 01:49:54.576]  Yeah, so, I mean, exactly.
[01:49:54.576 --> 01:49:57.058]  It is some of the most horrible stuff you could ever see, witness, hear.
[01:49:57.058 --> 01:50:02.224]  And like I said, a lot of times that's the stuff that kind of creeps up in your head and dreams at night when you lay down.
[01:50:02.224 --> 01:50:07.409]  A lot of things that'll keep you up at night as well, but it is disgusting to see something like that happen here.
[01:50:07.409 --> 01:50:12.434]  And the fact that people have this information now, they can see it but still ignore the fact
[01:50:13.055 --> 01:50:13.996]  That's what's going on.
[01:50:35.479 --> 01:50:37.821]  I just don't understand how people allow this to happen.
[01:50:37.821 --> 01:50:39.503]  I mean, what did you think about it all?
[01:50:39.503 --> 01:50:42.866]  Well, yeah, it was a crazy place, and let's not forget that there's a high school right next to it.
[01:50:42.866 --> 01:50:44.227]  So it's almost like it's hidden.
[01:50:44.227 --> 01:50:46.369]  Like, they don't want people to know what's going on in there.
[01:50:46.369 --> 01:50:48.932]  But, um, I mean, it's South Side Chicago.
[01:50:48.932 --> 01:50:49.873]  It's called Chi-Rac.
[01:50:50.433 --> 01:50:52.154]  It's one of the most violent places in the country.
[01:50:52.154 --> 01:50:56.415]  I think it's important not to forget that it also has the strictest gun laws in the country.
[01:50:56.415 --> 01:50:56.895]  Yep.
[01:50:56.895 --> 01:50:57.396]  Well, that's the thing.
[01:50:57.396 --> 01:50:59.856]  They're going to argue, yeah, we're doing this because it's rough.
[01:50:59.856 --> 01:51:01.017]  We got to get tough.
[01:51:01.017 --> 01:51:03.018]  The drugs are shipped in by the government.
[01:51:03.018 --> 01:51:04.498]  It's laundered by the government.
[01:51:04.498 --> 01:51:06.079]  They won't let the people have guns.
[01:51:06.079 --> 01:51:08.700]  They created this artificial environment.
[01:51:08.700 --> 01:51:13.942]  The government controls the mafia completely since the 70s.
[01:51:13.942 --> 01:51:14.962]  They are the mafia, yeah.
[01:51:16.038 --> 01:51:17.539]  I mean, there's no other way around it.
[01:51:17.539 --> 01:51:28.985]  I mean, like you said, they've taken the gun, so you as a citizen there, if you're a law-abiding citizen, have no way to defend yourself from the criminals and thugs that they've brought in, created by this war on drugs.
[01:51:28.985 --> 01:51:34.748]  I mean, it's completely and totally disgusting that this stuff is allowed to happen.
[01:51:34.748 --> 01:51:41.232]  Well, Joe, you know about all this stuff overseas, but just imagine how big this is under the surface.
[01:51:42.284 --> 01:51:47.228]  Yeah, I mean that's what we said last time when we were driving through there and actually looking at the building, we're filming some of the reports.
[01:51:47.228 --> 01:51:56.775]  I was sitting there telling them, I was like, if this one is here, and we know about this one, I wonder how many more across the country are there that we don't know about?
[01:51:56.775 --> 01:52:00.478]  How long is it going to take for these places to be exposed?
[01:52:00.478 --> 01:52:05.222]  How many people, besides the 7,000 here, how many more have been held without their rights?
[01:52:05.222 --> 01:52:06.983]  How many more people have been tortured?
[01:52:06.983 --> 01:52:10.947]  How many more people, people's lives are going to be affected by that torture?
[01:52:11.721 --> 01:52:28.299]  I mean, to be a normal person walking down the road and then a group of armed thugs grab you and chain you new to the ground and put you in stress positions while, you know, strobe lights are going off and horrible music for hours on end, that psychologically screws you up.
[01:52:28.299 --> 01:52:30.502]  I mean, you can't go back to a normal life after that.
[01:52:32.739 --> 01:52:46.762]  I just look at these Hillary supporters when she's up there saying we need to go ahead and look at having nationwide gun confiscation, and I look at how soft and disconnected and not in reality they are, and how they love living in these cities that have the highest crime rates, and how they're fed on.
[01:52:46.762 --> 01:52:52.463]  They're just incredible victims, but they're also dangerous and despicable.
[01:52:52.463 --> 01:52:55.303]  I'm just sick of them.
[01:52:55.303 --> 01:52:58.724]  Yeah, like I said, the greatest analogy for the
[01:53:00.137 --> 01:53:06.260]  The Hillary Clinton thing was like a train full of idiots derailed and tipped over and everyone spilt into that arena there.
[01:53:06.260 --> 01:53:19.248]  I mean, it was literally like an apocalyptic type deal where these zombies were just like, you know, walking around with their hands out like, Hillary, Hillary, take our guns!
[01:53:19.248 --> 01:53:22.250]  You know, none of them had any normal facial expressions.
[01:53:22.250 --> 01:53:24.171]  They didn't have any unique thoughts.
[01:53:24.171 --> 01:53:26.032]  You know, they were just like, well, I like Hillary.
[01:53:26.032 --> 01:53:27.493]  Yeah, that's a good idea.
[01:53:27.493 --> 01:53:28.013]  It's a great thing.
[01:53:29.025 --> 01:53:29.425]  No, it's not.
[01:53:29.425 --> 01:53:32.566]  If you actually look at the facts and you see what's going on, no, it's not.
[01:53:32.566 --> 01:53:35.688]  Look at these places that they're in control of and see how that's working out for them.
[01:53:35.688 --> 01:53:39.589]  The same thing that happened when we went to UT, for the gun-free UT.
[01:53:39.589 --> 01:53:42.150]  You tried to talk to some of those people and none of them wanted to talk to you.
[01:53:42.150 --> 01:53:48.253]  And I think this is a good thing that all these people need to pay attention to, is that this is what happens in a society where guns are taken away.
[01:53:48.253 --> 01:53:51.734]  And yet people will argue and say that, well, it's not an outright gun ban in Chicago.
[01:53:51.994 --> 01:53:53.635]  But there are no gun stores in Chicago.
[01:53:53.635 --> 01:53:59.460]  You can't purchase a gun unless illegally purchasing a gun right outside of the state where there aren't stricter gun laws.
[01:53:59.460 --> 01:54:04.724]  I think people should pay attention to that stuff like this, this black site where 7,000 people have been disappeared.
[01:54:04.724 --> 01:54:06.866]  Numerous people have been killed secretly.
[01:54:06.866 --> 01:54:08.767]  And the people we talked to on the street, they were aware of it.
[01:54:08.767 --> 01:54:09.828]  Some of them were aware of it.
[01:54:09.828 --> 01:54:15.893]  And the ones that were, it was the people that you would think lived in Southside Chicago that were in the city for the day when we did the man on the street.
[01:54:15.893 --> 01:54:19.276]  They were aware of the situation, but most people out there had no idea.
[01:54:19.276 --> 01:54:20.117]  And a lot of them didn't care.
[01:54:21.075 --> 01:54:27.256]  But those are the people that go around saying we need stricter gun laws because people need to be kept safe.
[01:54:27.256 --> 01:54:29.697]  Well, it's obvious that it doesn't keep people safe.
[01:54:29.697 --> 01:54:32.278]  It allows criminals to flourish, and that's what's happening there.
[01:54:32.278 --> 01:54:34.458]  Well, it's when you make drugs illegal, you create more criminals.
[01:54:34.458 --> 01:54:39.619]  You create this drug trade that goes on, and they have to try to figure out ways to get the drugs.
[01:54:39.619 --> 01:54:41.380]  Then when you make the guns illegal, what happens?
[01:54:41.380 --> 01:54:42.480]  If you're a law-abiding citizen...
[01:54:43.453 --> 01:54:49.676]  And you want to have a gun driving through, if you live in Southside Chicago, and you get pulled over by a cop and you've got a gun, you're now a criminal.
[01:54:49.676 --> 01:54:55.539]  Yeah, there's no way I'd live in areas, like you said, one area of Chicago, there's almost no crime, it's really nice.
[01:54:55.539 --> 01:54:58.360]  Drive two miles, you're in a hellhole, the worst in the world.
[01:54:58.360 --> 01:55:00.161]  Highest crime rate in the world, Southside.
[01:55:00.161 --> 01:55:01.742]  There's no way I'd live there and not have a gun.
[01:55:02.262 --> 01:55:06.844]  And how come the cops drive around, they have guns and know that, but then they don't want us to have guns?
[01:55:06.844 --> 01:55:18.929]  Well, the average cop actually in Chicago is not actually for gun control, and I don't want to make this just about bashing police, because George Soros and others are projecting all the problems of the world on the police in general, using bad examples.
[01:55:18.929 --> 01:55:26.653]  This is the Feds, this is the globalists, with a CIA substation, we know the Justice Department's involved, testing, setting up
[01:55:27.253 --> 01:55:35.136]  These threat fusion centers to secretly interrogate, to hold people for days, to torture them, and it's being beta tested for the Patriots.
[01:55:35.136 --> 01:55:36.257]  You can believe it.
[01:55:36.257 --> 01:55:41.859]  So after they've set the precedent of this, I'll guarantee you they've got similar facilities around the country.
[01:55:41.859 --> 01:55:43.440]  In fact, I know they do.
[01:55:43.440 --> 01:55:45.901]  It's just we don't have as much intel from inside of them.
[01:55:45.901 --> 01:55:48.542]  This one is so blatantly out in the open.
[01:55:48.542 --> 01:55:54.165]  Well, the big psychological operation behind this is, like I said, they're taking what they use in Gitmo and overseas, and they're bringing it here to the home front.
[01:55:55.011 --> 01:55:55.812]  And now they're using it.
[01:55:55.812 --> 01:55:57.313]  And they're also using this and they're looking at it.
[01:55:57.313 --> 01:55:59.895]  They sit back and they're going, it's out in the public now.
[01:55:59.895 --> 01:56:01.536]  People are starting to know about it.
[01:56:01.536 --> 01:56:03.838]  Now they watch the media and they go, does anybody even care?
[01:56:03.838 --> 01:56:05.979]  No one's even making a fuss about it.
[01:56:05.979 --> 01:56:08.181]  The Guardian, us, that's it.
[01:56:08.181 --> 01:56:16.067]  There should be so many people, you should be able to turn on Fox, CNN, MSNBC, ABC, CBS, and everyone should be talking about this place.
[01:56:16.067 --> 01:56:19.110]  But no one is because nobody cares.
[01:56:19.110 --> 01:56:20.791]  That's part of that psychological operation.
[01:56:20.791 --> 01:56:22.092]  They're sitting back going, hmm.
[01:56:23.373 --> 01:56:25.514]  Well, they know we're doing this.
[01:56:25.514 --> 01:56:25.814]  7,000 people.
[01:56:25.814 --> 01:56:27.074]  We've disappeared here.
[01:56:27.074 --> 01:56:28.895]  Numerously forced drugs on.
[01:56:28.895 --> 01:56:30.456]  We've killed them.
[01:56:30.456 --> 01:56:31.136]  No one cares.
[01:56:31.136 --> 01:56:32.797]  I guess we can do whatever the hell we want.
[01:56:32.797 --> 01:56:34.277]  Alright, let's open up another one.
[01:56:34.277 --> 01:56:35.818]  That's the psyop.
[01:56:35.818 --> 01:56:38.099]  The fact that no one cares.
[01:56:39.073 --> 01:56:41.433]  And that they have pushed it out there for everyone to see.
[01:56:41.433 --> 01:56:42.274]  Well, that's it!
[01:56:42.274 --> 01:56:43.434]  What's coming next?
[01:56:43.434 --> 01:56:55.396]  I mean, now banks worldwide are grabbing people's private bank accounts that's after tax money and just saying it's ours because they're putting Goldman Sachs heads like Peter Sutherland over the EU.
[01:56:55.396 --> 01:56:57.616]  I mean, they're already just taking people's money.
[01:56:57.616 --> 01:56:59.076]  They're already announcing they're going to do it here.
[01:56:59.076 --> 01:57:04.097]  They're announcing they're getting rid of cash so that they can tax us for every transaction we make.
[01:57:04.097 --> 01:57:07.638]  I mean, the complacency is building a hellish world.
[01:57:09.138 --> 01:57:13.908]  I mean, what happens when they take the guns and one of the people who are anti-gunners gets robbed, jacked, shot?
[01:57:15.845 --> 01:57:16.746]  What are they going to say then?
[01:57:16.746 --> 01:57:17.486]  Take what?
[01:57:17.486 --> 01:57:18.347]  You already took the guns.
[01:57:18.347 --> 01:57:19.988]  Obviously criminals are going to get them any way they want to.
[01:57:19.988 --> 01:57:21.189]  That's why they're criminals.
[01:57:21.189 --> 01:57:21.909]  They don't care.
[01:57:21.909 --> 01:57:26.492]  These people are... You're going to go, well, if I only had a way to defend myself... I told you the story in college.
[01:57:26.492 --> 01:57:29.895]  I kept my guns at my parents in their gun safe in their big closet.
[01:57:29.895 --> 01:57:31.936]  And I was going to shooting range or deer hunting.
[01:57:31.936 --> 01:57:33.057]  I don't remember.
[01:57:33.057 --> 01:57:36.159]  And I was walking out with a rifle and a handgun.
[01:57:36.159 --> 01:57:36.980]  And the rifle was out.
[01:57:36.980 --> 01:57:38.341]  The handgun was in a case.
[01:57:38.341 --> 01:57:43.304]  And my dad's buddy from college, who's a major newspaper editor, major newspaper editor, has moved around.
[01:57:43.304 --> 01:57:44.225]  He's been different newspapers.
[01:57:46.374 --> 01:57:54.524]  I saw the rifle and out of the living room, I mean, we're talking through a dining room into a living room, we're talking 50 feet away, went like a woman.
[01:57:54.524 --> 01:57:58.529]  I've known this guy all my life, been to the beach with him, vacations, you know.
[01:57:58.529 --> 01:58:01.352]  And I said, I said, Chris, what's the big deal?
[01:58:02.409 --> 01:58:03.550]  It's just a rifle.
[01:58:03.550 --> 01:58:04.971]  My dad's like, yeah, let him show it to you.
[01:58:04.971 --> 01:58:07.513]  I go, it's not loaded.
[01:58:07.513 --> 01:58:07.874]  Take a look.
[01:58:07.874 --> 01:58:09.495]  He's like, please, get out of here!
[01:58:09.495 --> 01:58:11.477]  Like, again, was a giant cobra.
[01:58:11.477 --> 01:58:14.359]  But if he sees a cop with a gun, he doesn't go into that fear.
[01:58:14.359 --> 01:58:18.763]  These people, I'm telling you, are not in the real world.
[01:58:18.763 --> 01:58:27.831]  Look, they just, I mean, they would think somebody, like I said earlier, pulling a rabbit out, you know, and killing it and cooking it for dinner, you know, they'll call animal cruelty on you not knowing that's a lot less cruel than

[02:00:04.778 --> 02:00:09.600]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:09.600 --> 02:00:11.180]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.180 --> 02:00:12.721]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:12.721 --> 02:00:16.923]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:16.923 --> 02:00:20.984]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:28.868 --> 02:00:37.014]  Remember just six months ago, 40 plus Mexican college students criticized the mayor and they just disappeared.
[02:00:37.014 --> 02:00:38.615]  Turned out they've been murdered.
[02:00:38.615 --> 02:00:40.036]  This happens all over the world.
[02:00:40.036 --> 02:00:41.758]  This is a formula.
[02:00:41.758 --> 02:00:47.382]  This is a program that we're incrementally being marched into that's being beta tested.
[02:00:47.382 --> 02:00:51.685]  It's like the military admits, and they're good people, they're blowing the whistle.
[02:00:51.685 --> 02:00:53.186]  You know, just like my dad's cousin.
[02:00:54.585 --> 02:00:57.508]  You know, didn't like what was going on and got out of it.
[02:00:57.508 --> 02:01:01.893]  But at the same time, the public's been so ignorant, they don't realize what's happening.
[02:01:01.893 --> 02:01:06.097]  How do you reach out to a public that's so politically illiterate, Josh Owens?
[02:01:07.213 --> 02:01:15.617]  Well, I think that at some point you have to start a dialogue, and you have to make people open to listen to what you have to say, like we did when we were in Chicago.
[02:01:15.617 --> 02:01:21.940]  The thing is that there were a few outlets that were putting out the information that there was a black site.
[02:01:21.940 --> 02:01:31.504]  But even while we were there, the local papers were saying that it wasn't true, that it wasn't a CIA black site, that it wasn't going on there, and that nothing was happening, which is what they do every single time.
[02:01:31.504 --> 02:01:34.185]  And then when he talked to the locals, too, and he said, why do you think that they're doing that?
[02:01:35.666 --> 02:01:37.347]  The Chicago PD is like a bunch of thugs.
[02:01:37.347 --> 02:01:45.549]  He's like, those guys are going to go in and threaten those guys and say, hey, if you don't write that, or if you write what's really going on, we're going to come after you.
[02:01:45.549 --> 02:01:47.830]  Like you said, it is like gangland style there.
[02:01:47.830 --> 02:01:52.651]  They offhandedly threatened us when we went outside the building and the guy drove outside in public.
[02:01:52.651 --> 02:01:53.652]  It wasn't a private area.
[02:01:53.652 --> 02:01:54.672]  He said, don't film me.
[02:01:54.672 --> 02:01:56.192]  He said, don't film me, you'll get me killed.
[02:01:56.192 --> 02:01:57.613]  In a bank parking lot.
[02:01:57.613 --> 02:02:00.754]  Now he, he didn't, we didn't just accidentally like pan over to him.
[02:02:01.744 --> 02:02:03.845]  Josh is filming me right here.
[02:02:03.845 --> 02:02:13.549]  This guy drives out of his way off the main road to come into this parking lot just to say that by him being on film that we could get him killed.
[02:02:13.549 --> 02:02:17.311]  Well, and that is a horrible job they've got and they believe because they watch these cop shows.
[02:02:17.311 --> 02:02:18.192]  I watch these cop shows.
[02:02:18.192 --> 02:02:20.273]  They have this one Chicago detective.
[02:02:20.273 --> 02:02:20.973]  I forget the name of it.
[02:02:20.973 --> 02:02:24.875]  I saw it on a flight back from England.
[02:02:24.875 --> 02:02:28.816]  And they literally just break the law and torture everybody but it's always for a good cause in the end.
[02:02:31.158 --> 02:02:32.541]  That's not how the world really works.
[02:02:32.541 --> 02:02:39.255]  And what they're doing is, just like they tried to turn my dad's quote, uncle, or really his cousin, call him an uncle, he's like 10 years older.
[02:02:40.171 --> 02:02:44.615]  Just like they tried to turn him into one of these guys and he wouldn't do it once it got really bad.
[02:02:44.615 --> 02:02:46.296]  I mean, he was a real patriot.
[02:02:46.296 --> 02:02:48.158]  They're finding cops that'll do it.
[02:02:48.158 --> 02:02:53.642]  And man, I guarantee you these cops have got government badges, they're getting government federal pay.
[02:02:53.642 --> 02:02:56.344]  I guarantee you they have no idea long-term what they're involved in.
[02:02:56.344 --> 02:02:59.887]  They're supposedly supposed to be going after heroin and things like that.
[02:02:59.887 --> 02:03:04.811]  It's supposed to be a big area where they hold people who are involved with, you know, drug dealing and all that.
[02:03:05.712 --> 02:03:06.613]  And what is heroin?
[02:03:06.613 --> 02:03:08.095]  It's a drug that's very addictive.
[02:03:08.095 --> 02:03:09.416]  You know what else is addictive?
[02:03:09.416 --> 02:03:10.398]  Power.
[02:03:10.398 --> 02:03:15.844]  When you take cops like this and you put them in a black site where there's basically no law, they can do whatever they want.
[02:03:17.170 --> 02:03:26.137]  Maybe at the beginning it is used to go after super bad guys and they feel like they're doing the right thing, but eventually it's like shooting a drug into your veins.
[02:03:26.137 --> 02:03:27.578]  That power becomes addictive.
[02:03:27.578 --> 02:03:28.359]  That's it.
[02:03:28.359 --> 02:03:29.740]  Take Cartelian.
[02:03:29.740 --> 02:03:33.723]  The police had secret torture sites there, and it looked just like this one.
[02:03:33.723 --> 02:03:42.230]  It's an empowering thing to know that you can be in control of another human being and make them do whatever you want, and these people get put in these positions, they feel like gods.
[02:03:43.106 --> 02:03:43.987]  It's disgusting.
[02:03:43.987 --> 02:03:55.220]  It's a ritualistic type deal where they take these people and they've gone from doing the right thing, so to say, and trying to take these bad, you know, hardened criminals off the streets, to now they're just picking people up because they need another fix.
[02:03:56.172 --> 02:03:59.873]  They need to see that fear in another human being's eyes.
[02:03:59.873 --> 02:04:02.795]  That's what really gets them going, makes their heart beat, makes them feel alive.
[02:04:02.795 --> 02:04:05.216]  That's what I talked about earlier, that's called being psychotic.
[02:04:05.216 --> 02:04:06.776]  No, but that's what's happening.
[02:04:06.776 --> 02:04:13.939]  When you take that lawlessness away, when you take that law away and you don't hold people accountable in a position like that, it's easy to go over to the dark side.
[02:04:13.939 --> 02:04:18.841]  Well, especially when the commanders were at Blackside's Guantanamo in Iraq.
[02:04:20.077 --> 02:04:25.298]  I mean, the head guys there, as you documented, were hired out of federal operations.
[02:04:25.298 --> 02:04:33.040]  Well, another thing that they know they can get away with it, too, for a long time, because the bottom floor, I can't even see where's the picture, the bottom floor is an area where people go in to pick up stuff.
[02:04:33.040 --> 02:04:36.560]  If they get arrested, the cops take a cell phone or a gun or whatever.
[02:04:36.560 --> 02:04:39.741]  That's where they go and they can pick up their belongings, that first floor.
[02:04:39.741 --> 02:04:40.781]  So people go in there all the time.
[02:04:40.781 --> 02:04:42.302]  They hold press conferences.
[02:04:42.302 --> 02:04:45.462]  So it always just seemed like a normal place where operations were going on.
[02:04:45.462 --> 02:04:48.983]  Instead, second, third, fourth, fifth floor up, people are being tortured.
[02:04:49.583 --> 02:04:50.363]  Beaten.
[02:04:50.363 --> 02:04:51.384]  Stomped on.
[02:04:51.384 --> 02:04:56.806]  Meanwhile, behind this innocent-looking bookstore, the torture's going on.
[02:04:56.806 --> 02:04:57.367]  Incredible.
[02:04:57.367 --> 02:04:58.687]  Thank you, gentlemen.
[02:04:58.687 --> 02:05:00.788]  Kit Daniels, InfoWars.com.
[02:05:00.788 --> 02:05:04.290]  Hillary Clinton said repealing the Second Amendment is worth considering.
[02:05:04.290 --> 02:05:14.394]  The presidential candidate attacked the Second Amendment during an October 16th town hall meeting in which she said we should consider a nationwide gun ban and a buyback program to eradicate private gun ownership.
[02:05:14.634 --> 02:05:19.679]  She said that America should practically outlaw guns just like Australia, Canada, and the UK.
[02:05:19.679 --> 02:05:27.206]  But she failed to mention that she supported shipping guns to Syrian rebels, the majority of whom are either ISIS militants or affiliated with the Islamic State.
[02:05:27.206 --> 02:05:36.015]  Senator Rand Paul even said she was the biggest cheerleader for distributing guns to these rebels linked to not only ISIS but also Al Qaeda and the al-Nusra Front.
[02:05:36.255 --> 02:05:42.722]  Time and time again, journalists have interviewed the rebels of Syria, and almost all of them admitted they have pledged allegiance to these radical Islamic groups.
[02:05:42.722 --> 02:05:49.630]  According to journalist Ben Reynolds, there's simply no real separation between moderate rebel groups and hardline Salafists allied with Al Qaeda.
[02:05:49.630 --> 02:05:54.214]  So, in other words, Hillary thinks that the Second Amendment only applies to Al Qaeda and ISIS.
[02:05:54.214 --> 02:05:58.059]  Once again, this is Kit Daniels with InfoWars.com, and keep checking back for more reports.
[02:05:58.619 --> 02:06:08.722]  Most of the InfoWars radio listening audience is aware of the high quality, affordable firearms available that are made right here in America at htfirearms.com.

[02:07:54.717 --> 02:07:57.619]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[02:07:57.619 --> 02:08:02.442]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:08:27.436 --> 02:08:37.321]  The film is The Forecaster.
[02:08:37.321 --> 02:08:42.264]  And Martin Armstrong, of course, has armstrongeconomics.com.
[02:08:42.264 --> 02:08:44.285]  He is a former political prisoner.
[02:08:45.666 --> 02:08:53.336]  He began his studies into market behavior when he first became fascinated by the events during the crash of 66.
[02:08:53.336 --> 02:08:57.361]  He became one of the very first to begin forecasting currencies.
[02:08:57.361 --> 02:09:00.826]  He began creating a global model in the mid-70s and was published.
[02:09:00.826 --> 02:09:01.527]  The results about 72.
[02:09:03.257 --> 02:09:08.279]  By 85 Armstrong was certainly one of the top premier foreign exchange analysts in the world.
[02:09:08.279 --> 02:09:10.580]  And he was cited in the Wall Street Journal, you name it.
[02:09:10.580 --> 02:09:16.802]  Armstrong is the developer of economic confidence model based on business cycles.
[02:09:16.802 --> 02:09:26.206]  And then it goes over all of that and the different predictions he made about different crashes and the different tops of markets and things like that.
[02:09:26.206 --> 02:09:27.407]  And I wanted to get him on.
[02:09:28.769 --> 02:09:38.596]  To speak about what was currently happening in the world, the move by big banks to get rid of cash, what he sees with China moving to start dumping so-called U.S.
[02:09:38.596 --> 02:09:51.185]  Treasuries, and the fact that what is illegal and was denied until a few years ago is now admitted that worldwide currency rates are being rigged by insiders.
[02:09:52.379 --> 02:10:03.010]  That worldwide stock markets are being rigged, that interest rates, LIBOR is only part of it, are being rigged, and that only a select few get to act on that insider trading knowledge.
[02:10:03.010 --> 02:10:15.283]  If they catch a low-level person acting on insider trading, say you work at a company, you know a merger is coming in two months, you think that merger is probably going to lower the price of the stock, you go ahead and sell it.
[02:10:16.937 --> 02:10:20.483]  Well, that's just common sense what somebody do, but no, that's insider trading.
[02:10:20.483 --> 02:10:22.366]  We're going to put you in prison for that for $5,000, $20,000.
[02:10:22.366 --> 02:10:24.249]  We'll put Martha Stewart in for a couple hundred thousand dollars.
[02:10:28.951 --> 02:10:31.632]  But then the big boys do it every day.
[02:10:31.632 --> 02:10:35.374]  So there's so many places to go with Armstrong, Martin Armstrong.
[02:10:35.374 --> 02:10:38.836]  He was on before, loved having him as a guest, really informed fellow.
[02:10:38.836 --> 02:10:46.960]  I could ask a lot of questions here, Mr. Armstrong, but where do you think we should start with this whole cornucopia of craziness happening?
[02:10:46.960 --> 02:10:57.686]  I mean, am I wrong in saying, do you agree that we're really entering a more volatile time where things are compacted and we're about to see a lot of economic and political and military action?
[02:10:59.557 --> 02:11:05.384]  Yeah, the next four years is basically really going to be pretty bad.
[02:11:05.384 --> 02:11:08.047]  It's all coming to a head at this stage in the game.
[02:11:08.047 --> 02:11:16.056]  And the biggest problem people don't realize is that it is it's really debt driven.
[02:11:16.056 --> 02:11:19.600]  And what that means is that if you look at the national debts,
[02:11:20.824 --> 02:11:24.625]  70% of it is accumulative interest.
[02:11:24.625 --> 02:11:31.327]  So, you know, it didn't even create a socialist agenda, you know, helping people or anything of the nature.
[02:11:31.327 --> 02:11:35.328]  Although that's the greatest, you know, sales pitch that they always say.
[02:11:35.328 --> 02:11:40.169]  But it, you know, when you look at it, it money's going out the back door and
[02:11:42.051 --> 02:11:50.954]  So, the debt crisis is really driving everything because governments know that they're starting to lose power.
[02:11:50.954 --> 02:11:57.537]  And as they lose power, then you're looking at this eliminating cash.
[02:11:57.537 --> 02:12:01.999]  All this is basically designed to get more taxes.
[02:12:01.999 --> 02:12:07.901]  Rather than reform the system and say, hey, something's really screwed up here.
[02:12:07.901 --> 02:12:09.662]  No, they just try to hold on to it.
[02:12:11.820 --> 02:12:17.266]  I mean, the media doesn't really tell the truth about much of anything.
[02:12:17.266 --> 02:12:23.792]  I really laugh when you see Hillary Clinton trying to pretend she's really for the poor and all this sort of stuff.
[02:12:23.792 --> 02:12:28.818]  And then she goes rents a house on the beach for 150 grand, but for two weeks, no less.
[02:12:30.043 --> 02:12:34.127]  But it was the Clintons that started this mess.
[02:12:34.127 --> 02:12:40.432]  They repealed Glass-Steagall and allowed the banks to start proprietary trading.
[02:12:40.432 --> 02:12:45.597]  And that really profoundly changed the banking system.
[02:12:45.597 --> 02:12:49.260]  It's created transactional banking.
[02:12:49.260 --> 02:12:52.784]  It's not what a lot of people think.
[02:12:52.784 --> 02:12:56.107]  They just trade money back and forth to each other and charge each other fees.
[02:12:57.898 --> 02:13:08.986]  Yeah, I mean, it's basically before banks would what they would do is, you know, if I was a banker, I would lend you money for your start of business.
[02:13:08.986 --> 02:13:15.590]  But I would, you know, there was a relationship, I would come down, make sure you're doing okay, etc.
[02:13:15.590 --> 02:13:22.275]  When Clinton repealed Glass-Steagall, the argument to do so was that if they could start trading,
[02:13:23.424 --> 02:13:32.850]  Then that would make the banking system more secure because they wouldn't risk if there was an economic decline or failures, etc.
[02:13:32.850 --> 02:13:42.775]  So what they did with the 07 and the mortgage-backed securities, they started packaging this stuff and then reselling it.
[02:13:42.775 --> 02:13:47.058]  So it became transactional banking rather than relationship.
[02:13:48.601 --> 02:13:52.088]  So I no longer care really what happens to you.
[02:13:52.088 --> 02:13:56.136]  As long as it looks good on paper, hey, and I got somebody else will buy it.
[02:13:56.136 --> 02:13:58.520]  I'll lend you money and I sell it to somebody else.
[02:13:58.520 --> 02:14:00.063]  If you default, that's their problem.
[02:14:01.027 --> 02:14:09.738]  So we're in this period of really where the banks are no longer what they used to be.
[02:14:09.738 --> 02:14:14.143]  And it's really causing a tremendous problem.
[02:14:14.143 --> 02:14:18.728]  The second thing that the Clintons did was effectively
[02:14:20.233 --> 02:14:26.758]  You know, he stood up and said, Oh, well, they signed in the, you know, the Education Act.
[02:14:26.758 --> 02:14:28.960]  And they're going to make it more affordable.
[02:14:28.960 --> 02:14:32.583]  So they said they were on lower interest rates for students.
[02:14:32.583 --> 02:14:45.414]  But what they didn't tell you was that they, you know, at the back door again, what they do with the bankers, they cut a deal and they made that students cannot even get rid of the what they owe on in bankruptcy.
[02:14:46.257 --> 02:14:51.182]  I mean, you can go bankrupt on just about everything but student loans.
[02:14:51.182 --> 02:15:02.334]  So it's having a major impact in the sense that you're seeing marriages are declining dramatically because kids can't afford to really get married.
[02:15:02.334 --> 02:15:07.900]  And, you know, with a high debt from student loans, they can't even get a mortgage.
[02:15:09.451 --> 02:15:16.377]  So it's really, it's having a real serious impact across the board.
[02:15:16.377 --> 02:15:36.155]  Well, when you look at the United Nations, and you look at agenda 21, and the post-growth period, and the plan to reduce savings so that people are too poor to have children, there really is a method of the madness, and the establishment, of course, basically exempts themselves
[02:15:37.441 --> 02:15:39.842]  From what they're foisting on the American people.
[02:15:39.842 --> 02:15:40.402]  And you're right.
[02:15:40.402 --> 02:15:48.825]  Watching Hillary Clinton, just in a clip I played earlier, say that they should ban basically all the guns and confiscate them like Australia.
[02:15:48.825 --> 02:15:49.746]  She goes on to say...
[02:15:51.092 --> 02:16:13.360]  How she's fighting the big banks, too big to fail, and the mortgages and everything, when she was there with her husband and Larry Summers and all the rest of the folks who literally did this, as you were just saying, put all this in place so they could have unlimited free money themselves and then give us basically the debt.
[02:16:13.360 --> 02:16:15.481]  It's just so crazy.
[02:16:16.261 --> 02:16:21.886]  To watch the bipartisan elites do this, I don't see how they think they're ever going to get away with this.
[02:16:21.886 --> 02:16:24.789]  I mean, what a plan they've developed.
[02:16:24.789 --> 02:16:29.053]  You've been pretty accurate at predicting not just economic moves, but social moves.
[02:16:29.053 --> 02:16:34.778]  There's two different articles today, one in the New York Post, one in RT, saying America's due for a revolution.
[02:16:34.778 --> 02:16:37.280]  Do you think they've bit off more than they can chew?
[02:16:37.280 --> 02:16:39.842]  Because they've expanded derivatives, as you know.
[02:16:40.883 --> 02:16:43.125]  Since 2008.
[02:16:43.125 --> 02:17:00.737]  They have really consolidated the economy and then the ultra-rich have the gall to then push social change movements that push class envy to try to start some weird wealth redistribution move from the middle class to poor.
[02:17:00.737 --> 02:17:02.078]  So a type of bait-and-switch.
[02:17:02.078 --> 02:17:03.139]  Where do you see all this going?
[02:17:04.580 --> 02:17:11.809]  It's, you know, effectively, you know, the whole system is just really collapsing because of debt.
[02:17:11.809 --> 02:17:15.373]  And that's really what is driving everything.
[02:17:15.373 --> 02:17:16.855]  They can't sustain this.
[02:17:16.855 --> 02:17:17.676]  So.
[02:17:19.754 --> 02:17:24.056]  I don't see it lasting very much longer.
[02:17:24.056 --> 02:17:30.400]  We have offices in Beijing and Abu Dhabi and around Europe, etc.
[02:17:30.400 --> 02:17:32.441]  And I travel all over the place.
[02:17:32.441 --> 02:17:36.283]  I was just in Greece for their last elections.
[02:17:36.283 --> 02:17:41.546]  Everywhere I go, people are very angry at career politicians.
[02:17:42.540 --> 02:17:44.261]  That's really what's coming down.
[02:17:44.261 --> 02:17:49.804]  So I see this as a worldwide problem and a trend.
[02:17:49.804 --> 02:17:55.406]  And you're seeing it more in Europe right now because they feel the pain first.
[02:17:55.406 --> 02:17:57.407]  And eventually it will come here.
[02:17:57.407 --> 02:17:58.908]  You're seeing it in Japan.
[02:17:58.908 --> 02:18:01.689]  In Japan they call it the celibacy syndrome.
[02:18:01.689 --> 02:18:04.371]  The kids aren't even dating unless they're getting married.
[02:18:05.411 --> 02:18:18.380]  And in Canada, you had the finance minister, he came out and actually said that, well, they should work for free just to get experience while they're living in the basement of their parents.
[02:18:19.593 --> 02:18:20.973]  I mean, this is a joke.
[02:18:20.973 --> 02:18:25.295]  I mean, in Europe, you have unemployment among youth about 60%.
[02:18:25.295 --> 02:18:27.555]  They call it the lost generation.
[02:18:27.555 --> 02:18:31.156]  So we're heading towards major civil unrest.
[02:18:31.156 --> 02:18:35.297]  And this is what revolution is really about.
[02:18:35.297 --> 02:18:38.498]  It comes around about right on a cycle about every 300 years.
[02:18:39.998 --> 02:18:47.400]  And, you know, we asked for it, I think, honestly, because we're too complacent.
[02:18:47.400 --> 02:18:50.640]  We just allow the politicians to do whatever they want.
[02:18:50.640 --> 02:18:52.101]  We believe whatever they say.
[02:18:52.101 --> 02:18:59.962]  And, you know, the media just honestly, it just gets to be really ridiculous.
[02:18:59.962 --> 02:19:07.904]  I mean, if you look at my case in the movie, they put a little clip on there from Bloomberg News.
[02:19:08.530 --> 02:19:13.113]  When they were trying to do it, everybody said, gee, you know, that I was all over the press.
[02:19:13.113 --> 02:19:14.674]  I've been erased.
[02:19:14.674 --> 02:19:17.275]  You go to Bloomberg terminals, I don't show up.
[02:19:17.275 --> 02:19:19.537]  We used to publish on there.
[02:19:19.537 --> 02:19:26.921]  So it's really kind of a joke that the producers of the film couldn't find anything.
[02:19:26.921 --> 02:19:30.964]  And they finally found that clip on a Wayback Machine.
[02:19:30.964 --> 02:19:35.447]  And then they went to Bloomberg and said, hey, well, we found something you said doesn't exist.
[02:19:36.275 --> 02:19:38.697]  And so they had to allow him to put it in the movie.
[02:19:38.697 --> 02:19:48.723]  But it's, you know... Gretchen Morgenson will be on the front page of the New York Times saying, what's going on here?
[02:19:48.723 --> 02:19:50.064]  Stay there, absolutely.
[02:19:50.064 --> 02:19:52.625]  Martin Armstrong, a man put into the memory hole.
[02:19:52.625 --> 02:19:56.748]  And if they can put one man in, they can put every man and woman into the memory hole.
[02:19:56.748 --> 02:19:57.508]  It's Big Brother 2.0.
[02:19:59.059 --> 02:20:08.482]  We use mobile devices right against our bodies every day, but growing scientific evidence has emerged showing serious health risks associated with exposure to EMF radiation emitted from these devices.

[02:21:58.146 --> 02:22:01.709]  Young people are supposed to be full of energy and recover quickly from exercise.
[02:22:01.709 --> 02:22:05.291]  Their age should give them a great advantage to feeling good all the time.
[02:22:05.291 --> 02:22:11.236]  However, young people of today are dealing with the same nutrient deficient food as everyone else in America.

[02:22:21.483 --> 02:22:22.464]  I'm 25 years old.
[02:22:22.464 --> 02:22:25.406]  At the end of a tiring work shift, I used to not do much around the house.
[02:22:25.646 --> 02:22:36.033]  Since I started taking the new Technology Enhance One World Way after work, I have so much energy when I get home that I'm able to take long walks, do chores, and even honey to-do lists from the wife.
[02:22:36.033 --> 02:22:40.736]  It's plenty enough energy to get things done around the house and time to settle down before bedtime.

[02:24:06.641 --> 02:24:09.703]  We got callers all over the map, and I know our guests can speak to it.
[02:24:09.703 --> 02:24:12.425]  That's coming up in the next segment.
[02:24:12.425 --> 02:24:14.867]  This headline just went up on Infowars.com.
[02:24:14.867 --> 02:24:18.110]  Russians threaten to shoot down Israeli aircraft.
[02:24:18.110 --> 02:24:22.653]  Israelis allegedly attempt to spy on Russian ships and aircraft in Syria.
[02:24:22.653 --> 02:24:23.174]  Allegedly?
[02:24:23.174 --> 02:24:23.774]  It's all admitted.
[02:24:23.774 --> 02:24:25.375]  Everybody spies on each other.
[02:24:25.375 --> 02:24:33.582]  An Arab language news network in Iran reports Russian fighter jets intercepted Israeli aircraft on an espionage mission near the Syrian border Sunday.
[02:24:35.888 --> 02:24:44.971]  Al Alam quoted the Israeli daily as saying the Russians forced the Israeli aircraft to change course after they were detected with radar.
[02:24:44.971 --> 02:24:55.275]  The Russians blocked the Israeli aircraft while flying over the Akkar region of northern Lebanon and sent a warning they would open fire if they violated the Syrian airspace.
[02:24:56.135 --> 02:24:58.216]  Well, we know that's been happening with U.S.
[02:24:58.216 --> 02:24:59.117]  aircraft as well.
[02:24:59.117 --> 02:25:03.859]  It's really sad to see our government on the side of the jihadis over there.
[02:25:03.859 --> 02:25:06.781]  I'm not lionizing Russia, as I've said a thousand times probably, but...
[02:25:08.464 --> 02:25:10.166]  Russia's defending its national interest.
[02:25:10.166 --> 02:25:13.609]  We are there destroying our national interest.
[02:25:13.609 --> 02:25:21.237]  We've got Armstrong, economics head, Martin Armstrong on, famous predictor of trends.
[02:25:21.237 --> 02:25:26.903]  They made a major film about him and the response of the establishment was he didn't exist.
[02:25:26.903 --> 02:25:28.444]  Of course, the film gets into all that.
[02:25:30.146 --> 02:25:38.311]  Just amazing the type of stuff that they pull that they were able to interview a lot of the big Wall Street heavies about what had happened.
[02:25:38.311 --> 02:25:42.373]  Let's get back to your film and your case because that's a window into all this.
[02:25:42.373 --> 02:25:44.255]  This is a short segment, long segment coming up.
[02:25:44.255 --> 02:25:46.316]  We can get into the world economy and where you see it going.
[02:25:46.316 --> 02:25:51.239]  But for folks that don't know, it's important for them to know what happened to you in a nutshell.
[02:25:51.239 --> 02:25:59.324]  Well, effectively, I don't entirely know because
[02:26:01.286 --> 02:26:09.533]  Our computer does, it's monitoring the entire world on a capital flow basis.
[02:26:09.533 --> 02:26:16.179]  And it has done amazing forecasting as far as war is concerned.
[02:26:16.179 --> 02:26:23.705]  I didn't quite understand it at first, but we had the Lebanese, Universal Bank of Lebanon,
[02:26:24.735 --> 02:26:24.895]  I think?
[02:26:45.157 --> 02:26:50.740]  You know, their currency was going to collapse in eight days, which I was very shocked.
[02:26:50.740 --> 02:26:57.004]  And I called the client, but the client's pay needed for what does the computer say, not what I say.
[02:26:57.004 --> 02:27:06.990]  So I told them, I said, you know, the says you got eight days and the client said to me, he says, okay, what currency do you think is best?
[02:27:06.990 --> 02:27:13.554]  Which I thought was really shocking because I thought I just delivered a major forecast with which I thought was nuts.
[02:27:14.775 --> 02:27:17.557]  And then I saw it, it did the same thing.
[02:27:17.557 --> 02:27:21.018]  Eight days later, the Lebanese War began.
[02:27:21.018 --> 02:27:25.381]  Then it did the same thing with the Iran-Iraq War.
[02:27:25.381 --> 02:27:30.304]  And then finally, I began to understand, you know, watching it for about 20 years,
[02:27:32.170 --> 02:27:39.616]  So, we saw $150 billion coming out of Russia, with only $100 billion going in.
[02:27:39.616 --> 02:27:46.881]  We stood up at our London conference and said, Russia's going to collapse, and you've got about 30 days.
[02:27:46.881 --> 02:27:54.207]  And I didn't realize, but the London Financial Times, somebody was there in that conference, and they put it on the front page.
[02:27:55.188 --> 02:27:59.750]  So, when Russia collapsed, that created long-term capital management and all that sort of stuff.
[02:27:59.750 --> 02:28:08.234]  So, that's when the CIA called us and said, hey, you know, okay, fine, we have to have this model.
[02:28:08.234 --> 02:28:13.736]  And I told them, look, we'll run it, any study you want, no problem.
[02:28:13.736 --> 02:28:16.297]  But then they said, no, we have to own it.
[02:28:16.297 --> 02:28:17.838]  And I said, well, you know, forget it.
[02:28:17.838 --> 02:28:20.179]  I'm not going to do it.
[02:28:22.082 --> 02:28:34.464]  That existed, but at the same time it was largely the banks that were illegally trading in our account, exactly the same as MF Global.
[02:28:34.464 --> 02:28:40.445]  And they were... Using segregated accounts to play the stock market?
[02:28:40.445 --> 02:28:41.125]  Pretty much.
[02:28:41.125 --> 02:28:45.566]  I mean, what they do is they play it one against the other.
[02:28:45.566 --> 02:28:50.187]  The rules in the States do not require a bank to tell you they're taking your money.
[02:28:52.603 --> 02:28:53.663]  And they sell it overnight.
[02:28:53.663 --> 02:28:55.504]  And they sell it in London.
[02:28:55.504 --> 02:28:58.625]  In London, they have to have a signature of a client.
[02:28:58.625 --> 02:29:02.266]  So what happens, it's the U.S.
[02:29:02.266 --> 02:29:06.568]  branch has an account with the London branch.
[02:29:06.568 --> 02:29:10.409]  And so to meet the law over there, they said, well, did the client agree?
[02:29:10.409 --> 02:29:11.549]  They said, yes, the U.S.
[02:29:11.549 --> 02:29:12.930]  branch agreed.
[02:29:12.930 --> 02:29:15.490]  So you have no idea what's going on.
[02:29:15.490 --> 02:29:18.751]  And what they were actually doing, I understood the system.
[02:29:18.751 --> 02:29:20.212]  So I was buying Fannie Mae.
[02:29:21.557 --> 02:29:24.618]  And, which are not, you can't post in repo.
[02:29:24.618 --> 02:29:33.020]  So I do what they could and could, so they start selling them, but not putting the entries in our accounts.
[02:29:33.020 --> 02:29:39.602]  And so... Hold on, explain that when we come back, because that's a technical... Stay there because your Skype's breaking up a bit.
[02:29:39.602 --> 02:29:43.983]  That's technical, so I want people to understand exactly what you're getting at.
[02:29:43.983 --> 02:29:45.503]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:29:45.503 --> 02:29:47.224]  Your phone calls as well on Alex Jones.
[02:29:47.224 --> 02:29:47.624]  Stay with us.
[02:29:48.084 --> 02:29:51.087]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:51.087 --> 02:29:54.671]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:58.803 --> 02:30:00.924]  Kit Daniels, InfoWurst.com.
[02:30:00.924 --> 02:30:06.045]  Did you know that since 1960, the number of married adults has decreased from 72% down to 51?
[02:30:06.045 --> 02:30:09.066]  In other words, barely half of all adults in the U.S.
[02:30:09.066 --> 02:30:10.967]  are married, which is a record low.
[02:30:10.967 --> 02:30:17.588]  Case in point, a Catholic pastor recently revealed he's only performing five marriages a year, down from 35 over 25 years ago.
[02:30:17.588 --> 02:30:20.709]  And the pastor, Charles Pope, said other priests have had similar experiences.
[02:30:20.709 --> 02:30:24.450]  But why are men shying away from marriage and even relationships with women in general?
[02:30:24.450 --> 02:30:26.131]  Well, Pastor Pope pointed out the obvious.
[02:30:26.391 --> 02:30:30.194]  Radical feminism is destroying marriage by driving a wedge between men and women.
[02:30:30.194 --> 02:30:38.460]  For one thing, thanks to feminism, many men are now so terrified of being labeled rapists that they shy away from showing any interest towards women, even women who hate feminism.
[02:30:38.460 --> 02:30:43.143]  And because of that, many women now complain they cannot find real men who have the confidence to approach them.
[02:30:43.143 --> 02:30:48.126]  There's a video report on InfoWars.com entitled, Why Men Are Giving Up on Marriage, which breaks it all down.
[02:30:48.126 --> 02:30:51.569]  And you can also find the video on our new YouTube channel called Resistance News.
[02:30:51.929 --> 02:30:58.172]  Once again, this is Kit Daniels with InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv, and keep checking back for more news and reports.
[02:31:06.957 --> 02:31:07.597]  I don't know.
[02:31:28.453 --> 02:31:29.574]  BrainForce is here.
[02:31:29.574 --> 02:31:31.775]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[02:31:31.775 --> 02:31:36.778]  You've probably noticed I've been more focused, less brain fog, more energy, and it's because of BrainForce.
[02:31:36.778 --> 02:31:39.960]  There's always hidden additives in your food, even organic food has hidden additives.
[02:31:39.960 --> 02:31:43.563]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[02:31:43.563 --> 02:31:45.524]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[02:31:45.524 --> 02:31:47.645]  It doesn't have stimulants, it doesn't have garbage in it.
[02:31:47.645 --> 02:31:49.647]  It has natural things that do it clean.
[02:31:49.647 --> 02:31:55.230]  You will find BrainForce and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[02:31:58.132 --> 02:31:59.052]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[02:31:59.052 --> 02:31:59.633]  Good, brother.
[02:31:59.633 --> 02:32:01.593]  Just recently started using your products.
[02:32:01.593 --> 02:32:03.294]  Everything you said about them is correct.
[02:32:03.294 --> 02:32:07.315]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them, and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[02:32:07.315 --> 02:32:09.956]  Well, thank you, brother, because it also funds our operation.
[02:32:09.956 --> 02:32:12.377]  But doing that, I know I've got to have the highest quality.
[02:32:12.377 --> 02:32:20.219]  Super Mill Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[02:32:20.399 --> 02:32:23.781]  We do the super male and the super female vitality.
[02:32:23.781 --> 02:32:25.322]  Big changes, a lot of energy.
[02:32:25.322 --> 02:32:28.263]  We've gotten off of the cheap energy drinks, energy shots.
[02:32:28.263 --> 02:32:30.004]  Saving a ton of money there.
[02:32:30.004 --> 02:32:35.807]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs, harvested around the planet, and then concentrated
[02:32:36.067 --> 02:32:37.808]  Or maximum potency.
[02:32:37.808 --> 02:32:44.311]  They want to stun and dumb down and energy drinks and stuff just cover that up for a while but then burn you out in my experience.
[02:32:44.311 --> 02:32:48.072]  Whereas stuff that gets your glands naturally going goes right to the source.
[02:32:48.072 --> 02:32:49.853]  So it's pretty exciting and I love it.
[02:32:49.853 --> 02:32:56.796]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today to secure your super male vitality and other powerful products from InfoWars Life.
[02:33:10.914 --> 02:33:13.555]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:33:13.555 --> 02:33:16.296]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:16.296 --> 02:33:18.477]  Martin Armstrong is our guest.
[02:33:36.354 --> 02:33:39.718]  Famous economist, famous analyst.
[02:33:39.718 --> 02:33:46.426]  The documentary, a major film, shows him on the news, him in the newspapers, predicting things that happened.
[02:33:46.426 --> 02:33:48.529]  The feds then came and grabbed him and took him to jail.
[02:33:52.248 --> 02:33:55.731]  It's pretty amazing when you see this type of persecution going on.
[02:33:55.731 --> 02:34:06.642]  And I think from my research, he can correct me if I'm wrong, we're starting to get to that, he could see their market manipulation and basically start telling clients how to trade off of watching them manipulate.
[02:34:06.642 --> 02:34:13.769]  Now you have flash trading, high frequency trading, the Plunge Protection Team, the President's Open Market Committee.
[02:34:15.353 --> 02:34:22.799]  We've gone from a point where it was a conspiracy theory to say you could see manipulation of the gold market or the oil market or the interest rates.
[02:34:22.799 --> 02:34:30.324]  Now that's all admitted, but they kind of just hide it in plain view and nobody gets in trouble.
[02:34:30.324 --> 02:34:37.670]  Because the big guys are allowed to do this as they consolidate the economy in a crony system while developing a police state.
[02:34:40.051 --> 02:34:50.358]  To suppress the population when the whole thing goes belly up, I guess they'll have theirs and the rest of us will be out in the cold in a road warrior scenario.
[02:34:50.358 --> 02:34:54.441]  Martin, you were getting into why they got upset with you as best you know.
[02:34:54.441 --> 02:34:56.002]  Finish up with that.
[02:34:56.002 --> 02:35:03.767]  And then where do you, I know we talked about this, but clearly they know where this is all going and clearly they're trying to
[02:35:04.986 --> 02:35:14.672]  Have a rearguard action of social engineering, divide and conquer, police state, but I don't really see that working.
[02:35:14.672 --> 02:35:21.916]  No, I mean, I think that the, in my case, it was exactly like, like MF Global.
[02:35:21.916 --> 02:35:31.942]  They were, like I said, I was, we were buying Fannie Mae's rather than T-Bills, because Fannie Mae's you could not resell for the night in repo in London.
[02:35:33.407 --> 02:35:39.351]  So they were just selling our Fannie Mae's and not putting entries in our accounts and then using the cash.
[02:35:39.351 --> 02:35:42.974]  And they just get away with this stuff.
[02:35:42.974 --> 02:35:44.335]  It's just amazing.
[02:35:44.335 --> 02:35:52.922]  But what it is, is that the major banks are the primary dealers.
[02:35:52.922 --> 02:35:59.887]  So they always get bailed out by threatening the government and saying, listen, if you take us down, then who's going to sell your debt?
[02:36:00.717 --> 02:36:06.801]  So that's been the hook that constantly goes back and forth.
[02:36:06.801 --> 02:36:09.243]  But I believe this is really coming to a head.
[02:36:09.243 --> 02:36:11.524]  That's what our computer's been showing.
[02:36:11.524 --> 02:36:15.947]  This is just, it's getting to the point of a major, major crisis.
[02:36:15.947 --> 02:36:21.330]  We are at interest rates and now we're at 5,000 year lows.
[02:36:21.330 --> 02:36:24.232]  And it's just not sustainable.
[02:36:24.232 --> 02:36:29.696]  The quantitative easing has been really a mess in the sense that the banks
[02:36:32.205 --> 02:36:37.608]  The Fed bought in 30-year bonds to try and help the mortgage market.
[02:36:37.608 --> 02:36:44.051]  Well, the problem is they're not going to be able to resell them now.
[02:36:44.051 --> 02:36:46.112]  So, the central banks are getting trapped.
[02:36:46.112 --> 02:36:51.155]  To be clear, the central banks are buying their own treasury bonds?
[02:36:51.155 --> 02:36:55.118]  Well, it's not their bonds, it's the government's bonds.
[02:36:55.118 --> 02:36:59.200]  But still, the central banks, even though they're quasi-private, it's one and the same is my point.
[02:37:00.846 --> 02:37:11.035]  Yeah, on the balance sheet they are separate, but they're buying the feds, the federal government, the treasury.
[02:37:11.035 --> 02:37:21.003]  Sure, so how long can all of that crud sit in the fandom zone before it bubbles up to the surface, or could this new magical made-up economy go on forever?
[02:37:22.188 --> 02:37:27.070]  No, I honestly I don't think it's going to last beyond probably March of next year.
[02:37:27.070 --> 02:37:31.251]  You're going to start seeing it going a little bit nuts.
[02:37:31.251 --> 02:37:36.393]  Europe is already, it's far worse there than here.
[02:37:36.393 --> 02:37:37.434]  Sure.
[02:37:37.434 --> 02:37:40.515]  Mainly because of the design of the euro has been
[02:37:41.778 --> 02:37:43.860]  A complete disaster.
[02:37:43.860 --> 02:37:49.427]  And people don't, in the States, they tend to look at the dollar and don't understand why it's so strong.
[02:37:49.427 --> 02:37:52.931]  But honestly, if you look around the world, there's no place to put money.
[02:37:54.231 --> 02:38:00.454]  The euro could never compete with the dollar because they didn't have a single debt.
[02:38:00.454 --> 02:38:09.657]  If you wanted to buy European bonds, you had to look at each individual country the same way you would have to buy state bonds here.
[02:38:09.657 --> 02:38:12.899]  In theory, they thought all interest rates would be the same.
[02:38:12.899 --> 02:38:16.640]  I told them when they came to us in 1998, I told them this was going to fail.
[02:38:19.144 --> 02:38:22.328]  You can't design a currency like this.
[02:38:22.328 --> 02:38:30.477]  And they said they understood that they just wanted to get the currency through first and then they would take care of the debt.
[02:38:30.477 --> 02:38:31.318]  But they never did.
[02:38:31.318 --> 02:38:38.065]  So each bank in Europe is far worse than the United States because
[02:38:39.999 --> 02:38:45.062]  Well, I totally agree with you, so let me ask you this question.
[02:38:45.062 --> 02:38:47.223]  How do you see the dominoes falling?
[02:38:47.223 --> 02:38:56.609]  Because if the private big banks have got so much free money, because they have the first use, you know, of this interest-free money, that they don't even want cash anymore, they don't even want
[02:38:56.989 --> 02:39:01.673]  Well, you know, the Fed was very nice and said, OK, we're going to do quantitative easing.
[02:39:24.872 --> 02:39:29.576]  It sounds like they're, you know, okay, they're going to expand the money supply.
[02:39:29.576 --> 02:39:36.121]  By bringing in the bonds, they, in theory, would be injecting the cash into the system.
[02:39:36.121 --> 02:39:39.444]  Then the banks said, well, we don't want to lend the money.
[02:39:39.444 --> 02:39:43.967]  So they created, at the same time, the excess reserve.
[02:39:43.967 --> 02:39:47.710]  And the Fed pays the banks a quarter of a percent interest.
[02:39:47.710 --> 02:39:50.252]  There's over two and a half trillion dollars sitting there.
[02:39:51.328 --> 02:39:53.529]  So it never went into the economy.
[02:39:53.529 --> 02:39:58.031]  And the rest of it, you know, China, etc.
[02:39:58.031 --> 02:40:00.893]  Everybody's been selling the long term.
[02:40:00.893 --> 02:40:01.753]  Thank you very much.
[02:40:01.753 --> 02:40:13.259]  So the money did not, you know, it under the old way of thinking, the Fed would buy bonds, and in theory, it would be an American selling it to them.
[02:40:13.259 --> 02:40:16.001]  So you were increasing the domestic money supply.
[02:40:17.059 --> 02:40:21.580]  But today is everybody's using the dollar globally.
[02:40:21.580 --> 02:40:26.362]  Sure, so it's musical chairs, people are going to the dollar because it's the best worst house on the block.
[02:40:26.362 --> 02:40:27.642]  How does it all end?
[02:40:27.642 --> 02:40:30.803]  When do you think it all starts to end?
[02:40:30.803 --> 02:40:38.445]  I honestly, it's going to start probably by March next year and go into 2017 and it's going to get kind of really nuts.
[02:40:39.288 --> 02:40:40.689]  I know people look at U.S.
[02:40:40.689 --> 02:40:44.552]  debt and say, oh, it's $18 trillion.
[02:40:44.552 --> 02:40:46.393]  Take a look at the emerging markets.
[02:40:46.393 --> 02:40:50.837]  Since 2007, they issued $9 trillion of debt.
[02:40:50.837 --> 02:40:54.559]  They owe half as much as the United States, and they don't even have the economy to support it.
[02:40:54.559 --> 02:40:54.760]  Sure.
[02:40:54.760 --> 02:40:56.021]  There's a bubble race.
[02:40:56.021 --> 02:41:00.844]  So no matter who loses the bubble race first, it affects everybody.
[02:41:00.844 --> 02:41:04.467]  You think in the next two years, we'll see most of these bubbles starting to go down?
[02:41:05.802 --> 02:41:12.903]  Yeah, because this is why the Fed realizes it's in trouble.
[02:41:12.903 --> 02:41:19.044]  Janet Yellen, and I'm glad I'm not her, she just really inherited a real nightmare.
[02:41:19.044 --> 02:41:23.445]  But what she keeps saying is that we have to normalize interest rates.
[02:41:23.445 --> 02:41:29.566]  The other side of the coin of this is that you have pension funds that are going bankrupt.
[02:41:29.566 --> 02:41:32.067]  CalPERS, they needed to make 7.5%, they came in at 2.4%.
[02:41:35.100 --> 02:41:38.341]  You know, you have pension funds going bust.
[02:41:38.341 --> 02:41:43.602]  So if just the subprime crisis triggered 2008, could it be Chicago going under?
[02:41:43.602 --> 02:41:45.362]  Puerto Rico going under?
[02:41:45.362 --> 02:41:49.323]  Could it be the California retirement fund going under?
[02:41:49.323 --> 02:41:53.424]  There are literally more than 50 of these time bombs.
[02:41:53.424 --> 02:41:58.365]  The big union pensions, as you know, are just getting cut in half, a bunch of them this week.
[02:42:01.306 --> 02:42:03.688]  I think the timers are starting to ding.
[02:42:03.688 --> 02:42:06.190]  I think this cake is pretty much done.
[02:42:06.190 --> 02:42:16.717]  Yeah, I mean, you know, they lowered the interest rates to help the banks, but in doing so, they didn't realize it now created a pension crisis.
[02:42:16.717 --> 02:42:25.944]  And they can't get the rates up to help the pension funds, and you have Europe trying to do negative rates, still trying to help the banks.
[02:42:25.944 --> 02:42:28.846]  It's an absolute disaster.
[02:42:31.643 --> 02:42:38.529]  I mean, from what we're seeing, the dominoes start to go overseas.
[02:42:38.529 --> 02:42:40.771]  Europe will probably be first.
[02:42:40.771 --> 02:42:48.057]  Then you're looking at Japan and emerging markets.
[02:42:48.057 --> 02:42:52.381]  You have Britain going to make a vote on exiting the EU.
[02:42:52.381 --> 02:42:55.763]  The polls right now are showing in favor of leaving.
[02:42:56.864 --> 02:43:02.906]  And I think once something like that begins, then the Euro is going to absolutely tank.
[02:43:02.906 --> 02:43:08.227]  We're looking at the Euro probably going to new historic lows under 80 cents.
[02:43:08.227 --> 02:43:12.728]  This is going to drive the dollar up as capital concentrates here.
[02:43:12.728 --> 02:43:21.311]  Eventually, you know, we'll go into tangible assets, but at first, they're just buying dollars to park money.
[02:43:21.311 --> 02:43:23.571]  Is that going to cause inflation?
[02:43:23.571 --> 02:43:25.352]  It causes deflation first.
[02:43:26.400 --> 02:43:28.983]  Which is what happened in the Great Depression.
[02:43:28.983 --> 02:43:34.530]  And going into 1932, the dollar went to all-time record highs.
[02:43:34.530 --> 02:43:39.736]  And that's what starts the protectionism, because they say they can't sell anything.
[02:43:39.736 --> 02:43:42.199]  So it'll be inflation in Europe, but not here in your view?
[02:43:43.712 --> 02:43:49.717]  It's, Europe is eventually just really just, it's in a complete meltdown mode.
[02:43:49.717 --> 02:43:55.861]  And once you see... And it's got the socialists committing suicide with the giant immigrant floods.
[02:43:55.861 --> 02:43:58.664]  I mean, I'll tell you, what a, I agree with you.
[02:43:58.664 --> 02:44:01.526]  Disaster, I mean Europe, disaster's not a strong enough word.
[02:44:02.751 --> 02:44:05.994]  It's, you have, uh, I was in Barcelona.
[02:44:05.994 --> 02:44:08.836]  They just voted to separate from Spain.
[02:44:08.836 --> 02:44:12.900]  I mean, I think Greece will end up breaking apart.
[02:44:12.900 --> 02:44:16.122]  You have Scotland trying to get out of the UK.
[02:44:16.122 --> 02:44:20.846]  You have UK basically going to probably vote to leave the Euro.
[02:44:20.846 --> 02:44:26.191]  I mean, 40% of the youth in France don't want to be French anymore.
[02:44:26.191 --> 02:44:30.755]  I mean, it's, it's a total mess everywhere I go over there.
[02:44:32.236 --> 02:44:32.756]  I agree with you.
[02:44:32.756 --> 02:44:34.418]  We've got callers all over the map.
[02:44:34.418 --> 02:44:39.421]  Our guest, Armstrong Economics, is Martin Armstrong, armstrongeconomics.com.
[02:44:39.421 --> 02:44:40.622]  Really interesting fellow.
[02:44:40.622 --> 02:44:41.643]  I suggest you see the film.
[02:44:41.643 --> 02:44:42.884]  It's excellent.
[02:44:42.884 --> 02:44:52.030]  Let's talk to Sherry in Texas, then we'll go to Eric, then we'll go to Drake, then we'll go to another Eric and a bunch of Erics and Pete and others.
[02:44:52.030 --> 02:44:53.772]  Sherry, thanks for holding her on the air with our guest.
[02:44:54.622 --> 02:44:55.683]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:44:55.683 --> 02:44:59.485]  Yeah, I see something happening that's going to really hurt the middle class.
[02:44:59.485 --> 02:45:01.006]  And I want his opinion on this.
[02:45:01.006 --> 02:45:02.227]  I see two things going on.
[02:45:02.227 --> 02:45:06.569]  First of all, because we need a less costly workforce.
[02:45:06.569 --> 02:45:09.291]  This $15 an hour will work.
[02:45:09.291 --> 02:45:19.497]  If they put in a low, a workforce that is given welfare, is funded by welfare, mostly
[02:45:23.246 --> 02:45:25.087]  People coming in from other countries.
[02:45:25.087 --> 02:45:28.569]  They'll be provided with low-cost housing, food stamps, Medicaid.
[02:45:28.569 --> 02:45:31.651]  It'll kind of be like a communist system.
[02:45:31.651 --> 02:45:37.655]  Unemployment... Sure, that's what we already have, is where they bring in people who then have to have welfare as a supplement to their low wage.
[02:45:37.655 --> 02:45:38.975]  What's your specific question?
[02:45:38.975 --> 02:45:43.678]  Specific question is, this will be $15 an hour.
[02:45:43.678 --> 02:45:48.541]  They'll pay in... They'll be paying most of the $15 in for this low-cost housing.
[02:45:48.541 --> 02:45:50.162]  They'll be taken care of.
[02:45:50.162 --> 02:45:51.523]  That leaves the middle class
[02:45:52.541 --> 02:45:53.042]  I don't
[02:46:07.097 --> 02:46:13.683]  These small businesses will be offered loans, and it's like, don't take them.
[02:46:13.683 --> 02:46:17.827]  Let me get his take on what you're getting at there.
[02:46:17.827 --> 02:46:25.854]  What will the US economy be like in your view, and what would an increased minimum wage do to the economy?
[02:46:25.854 --> 02:46:31.158]  Basically, the minimum wage is largely for people trying to start.
[02:46:31.158 --> 02:46:33.901]  It's a lot of propaganda, and unfortunately,
[02:46:34.901 --> 02:46:43.829]  The more, if you double the minimum wage, you're only going to make it more attractive for a lot of companies like McDonald's or whatever.
[02:46:43.829 --> 02:46:48.353]  I mean, here you walk into Wawa, you just push the buttons and that's it.
[02:46:48.353 --> 02:46:51.556]  You go to a park your car, there's nobody there.
[02:46:51.556 --> 02:46:57.041]  I mean, at $15 you're going to replace a lot of menial jobs basically with computers.
[02:46:58.680 --> 02:47:03.822]  Well, already, as you know, the move, France's plan for their economy is to go all robot.
[02:47:03.822 --> 02:47:06.023]  South Korea's plan is to go all robot.
[02:47:06.023 --> 02:47:09.024]  Samsung says they have robots now better than humans.
[02:47:09.024 --> 02:47:12.325]  Foxconn's replacing their labor with that in China.
[02:47:12.325 --> 02:47:17.107]  And this, I mean, you know the article, Why the Future Doesn't Need Us.
[02:47:17.107 --> 02:47:18.207]  Where do you see all that going?
[02:47:20.094 --> 02:47:32.854]  Basically, these are major waves of innovation and they are always linked to major depressions and things of this nature.
[02:47:32.854 --> 02:47:34.997]  The invention of the combustion engine
[02:47:36.084 --> 02:47:38.766]  Put all the horse and buggies at this.
[02:47:38.766 --> 02:47:39.546]  All right?
[02:47:39.546 --> 02:47:44.550]  And so, effectively, you have a problem with skilled labor.
[02:47:44.550 --> 02:47:48.793]  The people have to learn new skills to move to the next innovation.
[02:47:48.793 --> 02:47:56.318]  And, you know, they don't do that, and then that's what causes higher unemployment and things of this nature.
[02:47:56.318 --> 02:48:01.121]  I get asked a lot, you know, gee, what would I advise kids?
[02:48:01.121 --> 02:48:02.622]  Take programming.
[02:48:02.622 --> 02:48:03.642]  All right?
[02:48:03.642 --> 02:48:05.484]  If you understand how to program,
[02:48:06.778 --> 02:48:12.144]  Then you can learn whatever subject you're interested in, if it's medicine or whatever.
[02:48:12.144 --> 02:48:16.268]  But learning how to program, that is like learning how to read or write.
[02:48:16.268 --> 02:48:16.809]  Absolutely.
[02:48:16.809 --> 02:48:18.150]  And they don't teach anybody that.
[02:48:18.150 --> 02:48:22.535]  They teach them, go get some social degree that's totally worthless.
[02:48:22.535 --> 02:48:23.997]  And young people have almost no...
[02:48:24.897 --> 02:48:29.999]  Well, you have Forbes Magazine really showed that 60% of the kids that have a degree cannot find a job in whatever they have a degree in.
[02:48:51.810 --> 02:48:55.053]  It's really pretty bad.
[02:48:55.053 --> 02:49:03.819]  The education system is basically an elite welfare state because they don't have to produce anything.
[02:49:03.819 --> 02:49:08.323]  All they have to do is effectively just take the money in and that's it.
[02:49:10.131 --> 02:49:13.993]  They don't really care if you found the job or whatever.
[02:49:13.993 --> 02:49:15.314]  And a lot of them don't care either.
[02:49:15.314 --> 02:49:21.778]  They just want to act like they're innovating, act like they're part of a trendy socialist club, learn all the political correct terms, and drool.
[02:49:21.778 --> 02:49:23.960]  Let's go ahead and take another call here.
[02:49:23.960 --> 02:49:25.741]  Let's go ahead and talk to Pete.
[02:49:25.741 --> 02:49:26.942]  We're going to come back to Eric.
[02:49:26.942 --> 02:49:29.243]  Go ahead, Pete.
[02:49:29.243 --> 02:49:30.104]  Hello, Alex.
[02:49:30.104 --> 02:49:31.345]  It's Pete from Michigan.
[02:49:31.345 --> 02:49:31.645]  Yes, sir.
[02:49:31.645 --> 02:49:31.885]  Go ahead.
[02:49:33.330 --> 02:49:37.292]  I got a quick question for your guest and also I have some information for you later on.
[02:49:37.292 --> 02:49:37.592]  You bet.
[02:49:37.592 --> 02:49:38.592]  We're not screening your call.
[02:49:38.592 --> 02:49:39.073]  You're on air.
[02:49:39.073 --> 02:49:40.273]  Go ahead and talk to the guest.
[02:49:40.273 --> 02:49:40.873]  Okay.
[02:49:40.873 --> 02:49:42.174]  To the guest, I have a question.
[02:49:42.174 --> 02:49:53.219]  You're talking about all this economic stuff and I have not heard at all how we cannot pay off the national debt because it's all based on this fiat currency.
[02:49:53.219 --> 02:49:55.079]  Nobody really pitches that.
[02:49:55.079 --> 02:49:56.600]  Don't you think it'd be a good idea to
[02:49:57.153 --> 02:50:00.915]  Really promote that idea so that people can start to understand the real problem?
[02:50:00.915 --> 02:50:01.776]  That's a good point.
[02:50:01.776 --> 02:50:03.637]  I mean, look, we're told we can't get out of this debt.
[02:50:03.637 --> 02:50:07.920]  $18 trillion from what I've researched is nothing compared to the derivatives we've been signed on to.
[02:50:07.920 --> 02:50:10.041]  Is that correct, Mr. Armstrong?
[02:50:10.041 --> 02:50:11.782]  Well, forget the derivatives.
[02:50:11.782 --> 02:50:16.785]  I mean, worldwide debt is $160 trillion.
[02:50:16.785 --> 02:50:24.650]  So, this system never... There's only one country that ever paid off its debt and that was Romania.
[02:50:25.609 --> 02:50:33.432]  And it created massive deflation, and at that point in time, then they ended up in a revolution.
[02:50:33.432 --> 02:50:34.713]  So what do we do?
[02:50:34.713 --> 02:50:37.994]  Go ahead and just write it off?
[02:50:37.994 --> 02:50:44.597]  Effectively, I think the only solution to this is a complete debt restructuring like you would do with a corporation.
[02:50:44.597 --> 02:50:45.178]  Sure, stay there.
[02:50:45.178 --> 02:50:45.638]  Let's talk about it.
[02:50:45.638 --> 02:50:47.519]  Governments should not be able to borrow money.
[02:50:47.519 --> 02:50:48.979]  Period.
[02:50:48.979 --> 02:50:49.560]  Sure, stay there.
[02:50:49.560 --> 02:50:51.200]  We've got to go to break.
[02:50:51.200 --> 02:50:53.401]  Pete, you're going to get your comeback, and then we're going to go to Eric.
[02:50:53.401 --> 02:50:54.922]  Eric and Drake, stay with us.
[02:50:58.908 --> 02:51:09.818]  What would your life be like if you woke up each morning with new vitality, feeling better than you have in years, and you noticed a difference in your sleeping patterns, blood sugar levels, and had a sense of well-being overall?
[02:51:09.818 --> 02:51:13.982]  There's something that is changing thousands of people's lives, and you could be one of them.
[02:51:13.982 --> 02:51:16.144]  It's called Heart and Body Extract.
[02:51:16.144 --> 02:51:21.609]  Sharon Harris, co-creator of Heart and Body Extract, talks about the positive effects of Heart and Body Extract.
[02:51:21.769 --> 02:51:31.791]  What happens with the Formula Heart and Body Extract is it's giving the body the necessary vitamins, minerals, amino acids, enzymes, and phytonutrients so the body will heal itself.
[02:51:31.791 --> 02:51:38.292]  And yes, the body does have the ability to balance blood pressure, balance cholesterol, clean and unclog the arteries.
[02:51:38.292 --> 02:51:41.613]  It can also work on balancing the circulation for a diabetic.
[02:51:41.613 --> 02:51:43.673]  So the body is an amazing thing.
[02:51:43.673 --> 02:51:46.794]  It simply needs some help so it has the tools to heal itself.
[02:51:46.874 --> 02:51:50.258]  As if chlorine in our water weren't bad enough, now they're adding ammonia?
[02:52:02.433 --> 02:52:03.073]  It's true.
[02:52:03.073 --> 02:52:07.216]  Some municipalities are now adding ammonia plus chlorine to your water supply.
[02:52:07.216 --> 02:52:09.597]  It's a disinfectant called chloramine.
[02:52:09.597 --> 02:52:14.400]  But with a trusted Big Berkey water filter, you can keep chloramine out of your water.
[02:52:14.400 --> 02:52:26.967]  New NSF EPA certified lab tests show EPA Berkey water filters remove chloramines, pharmaceuticals, BPA, pesticides, bacteria and viruses, all forms of fluoride and much more.

[02:53:42.659 --> 02:53:45.880]  Go to newmana.com or call 888-597-0775 today to learn more.
[02:53:45.880 --> 02:53:46.180]  That's 888-597-0775.
[02:53:46.180 --> 02:53:46.520]  Newmana.
[02:53:46.520 --> 02:53:48.300]  Food storage you'll love to eat.
[02:54:02.638 --> 02:54:13.804]  By the way, in the first hour, I remembered that bizarre post-Piers Morgan interview where they had Buzz Bissinger and Ambassador... U.S.
[02:54:13.804 --> 02:54:16.166]  Ambassador's daughter on.
[02:54:16.166 --> 02:54:21.449]  Ambassador Stevens' daughter on, where they fantasized about killing me with guns because I want to own guns.
[02:54:21.449 --> 02:54:24.691]  Then they said, yeah, we'll dress up in uniforms and kill him.
[02:54:24.691 --> 02:54:27.052]  And it's just really weird, bizarre behavior.
[02:54:28.743 --> 02:54:36.254]  And now Salon, who has had a bunch of articles saying pedophilia is not a problem, and saying pedophiles are people too.
[02:54:38.117 --> 02:54:40.879]  Yeah, and if I catch him touching my kids, I'm going to run an ice pick in their eye.
[02:54:40.879 --> 02:54:41.999]  How's that sound?
[02:54:41.999 --> 02:54:45.181]  Because ice picks, you know, are ice picks too.
[02:54:45.181 --> 02:54:45.862]  Salon.
[02:54:45.862 --> 02:54:48.584]  People who want guns should be shot first.
[02:54:48.584 --> 02:54:49.404]  Quote.
[02:54:49.404 --> 02:54:53.487]  If you love guns, if they make you feel safe, then you need to be shot.
[02:54:53.487 --> 02:54:58.070]  So we're going to add that Buzz Bissinger thing to the bottom of that video just to show what I was talking about.
[02:54:58.070 --> 02:55:00.031]  This weird thing where they talk about violence.
[02:55:00.031 --> 02:55:02.272]  And again, I'm not even what you call a conservative.
[02:55:02.272 --> 02:55:03.053]  I'm a libertarian.
[02:55:04.701 --> 02:55:08.143]  But I'd be a liberal if you called me somebody like Thomas Jefferson.
[02:55:08.143 --> 02:55:11.185]  These new people that call themselves liberals are not liberals.
[02:55:11.185 --> 02:55:13.187]  They're very weird.
[02:55:13.187 --> 02:55:15.208]  Pete in Michigan, you had one other point you wanted to make.
[02:55:15.208 --> 02:55:17.269]  Go ahead, quickly please.
[02:55:17.269 --> 02:55:22.273]  Yeah, I just wanted to say your guest there is not exactly clearing the field on anything.
[02:55:22.273 --> 02:55:24.134]  He's talking about declaring bankruptcy.
[02:55:24.134 --> 02:55:24.854]  Yeah, that's fine.
[02:55:24.854 --> 02:55:28.497]  But first we need a plan, and then we need to declare the bankruptcy.
[02:55:29.136 --> 02:55:33.798]  But we need to get rid of the Federal Reserve Bank also or we're going to be right back in the same spot where we started.
[02:55:33.798 --> 02:55:34.638]  Well, I totally agree.
[02:55:34.638 --> 02:55:39.920]  The people that have maneuvered us into this situation need to be out of power, need to go back to an Americana system.
[02:55:39.920 --> 02:55:42.241]  Let me ask Mr. Armstrong this question.
[02:55:42.241 --> 02:55:47.363]  Just in a nutshell, what financial system would you call Americana?
[02:55:47.363 --> 02:55:50.544]  The system of Alexander Hamilton or some of the other systems?
[02:55:51.784 --> 02:56:00.867]  I mean, I would say just get back to Congress issuing the currency and get back to a system based on money supply, based on population, and based on economic growth.
[02:56:00.867 --> 02:56:03.808]  Go back to what we had pre-Federal Reserve.
[02:56:03.808 --> 02:56:10.751]  Well, I think, you know, the issue that you have to understand is you really have to dissect what the problem is.
[02:56:10.751 --> 02:56:16.693]  I know some people think that if you go back to the gold standard somehow that will turn politicians into saints.
[02:56:17.443 --> 02:56:19.064]  We had a gold standard.
[02:56:19.064 --> 02:56:23.627]  You know, they fixed gold at $35, but they continued to print money.
[02:56:23.627 --> 02:56:28.770]  So, you know, a two-year-old would figure out that that can't be sustained.
[02:56:28.770 --> 02:56:31.591]  The problem isn't what is the money.
[02:56:31.591 --> 02:56:34.313]  The problem is the politicians.
[02:56:34.313 --> 02:56:39.296]  And, you know, historically, for 6,000 years, they're the ones that always caused the problems.
[02:56:39.296 --> 02:56:40.997]  Sure, look at third world countries.
[02:56:40.997 --> 02:56:45.019]  I mean, they're always overprinting and getting it to themselves up front.
[02:56:45.019 --> 02:56:46.080]  It's just standard procedure.
[02:56:47.105 --> 02:56:51.768]  It's the politicians that are the real problem.
[02:56:51.768 --> 02:56:58.453]  What Jefferson spoke of, which he actually said prostitution should automatically expire every 19 years.
[02:56:58.453 --> 02:56:58.533]  Why?
[02:57:01.957 --> 02:57:10.380]  Because taxation without representation is basically what he defined as a national debt.
[02:57:10.380 --> 02:57:20.543]  Because now the younger generation has to pay higher taxes to pay off this national debt for something that was spent before they were even born.
[02:57:20.543 --> 02:57:23.763]  You shouldn't be able to saddle the next generation and we're now here.
[02:57:23.763 --> 02:57:24.864]  We're the next generation.
[02:57:24.864 --> 02:57:28.505]  Everybody living right now is about to get the comeuppance when all this comes to.
[02:57:29.673 --> 02:57:36.499]  Right, this is what Jefferson's talked about, that taxation without representation.
[02:57:36.499 --> 02:57:38.901]  So we're having to pay off this debt.
[02:57:38.901 --> 02:57:49.931]  I mean, I think the only solution, honestly, is there shouldn't be career politicians, and we should not allow the federal government to even borrow money.
[02:57:49.931 --> 02:57:50.732]  Sure, it's illegal.
[02:57:51.935 --> 02:57:53.817]  And that's what you need.
[02:57:53.817 --> 02:57:55.359]  All right?
[02:57:55.359 --> 02:57:58.663]  And that's the real crux of the problem.
[02:57:58.663 --> 02:58:09.916]  And if you were to deal with that issue, then you would at least be able to sustain a system a little bit longer than perhaps historically what has taken place before.
[02:58:11.627 --> 02:58:17.254]  All right, we're going to do five more minutes and I promise I'm going to Eric in Colorado, Eric in Michigan, and at least Drake in California.
[02:58:17.254 --> 02:58:24.342]  We're going to come in with your questions, your comments, and the final segment, and then a whole other hour with Leanne McAdoo.
[02:58:25.538 --> 02:58:25.778]  St.
[02:58:25.778 --> 02:58:30.660]  Louis has announced emergency plans for catastrophic nuclear event and more.
[02:58:30.660 --> 02:58:33.381]  And we've got Hillary saying they're coming out with the guns.
[02:58:33.381 --> 02:58:37.763]  Leanne McAdoo, the Wonder Woman of the Airwaves, in the fourth hour.
[02:58:37.763 --> 02:58:38.603]  Stay with us.
[02:58:38.603 --> 02:58:40.644]  We'll be back with one final segment with Martin Armstrong.
[02:58:48.539 --> 02:58:52.040]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[02:58:52.040 --> 02:59:00.304]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[02:59:00.304 --> 02:59:05.726]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[02:59:05.726 --> 02:59:08.247]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[02:59:08.247 --> 02:59:10.347]  We now have the synergistic solution.

[02:59:18.487 --> 02:59:19.607]  BrainForce is here.
[02:59:19.607 --> 02:59:21.808]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[02:59:21.808 --> 02:59:26.789]  You've probably noticed I've been more focused, less brain fog, more energy, and it's because of BrainForce.
[02:59:26.789 --> 02:59:28.489]  There's always hidden additives in your food.
[02:59:28.489 --> 02:59:30.090]  Even organic food has hidden additives.
[02:59:30.090 --> 02:59:33.571]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[02:59:33.571 --> 02:59:35.551]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[02:59:35.551 --> 02:59:36.471]  It doesn't have stimulants.
[02:59:36.471 --> 02:59:37.652]  It doesn't have garbage in it.
[02:59:37.652 --> 02:59:39.652]  It has natural things that do it clean.
[02:59:39.652 --> 02:59:45.253]  You will find BrainForce and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[02:59:50.620 --> 02:59:53.228]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:01.357 --> 03:00:07.984]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:00:07.984 --> 03:00:11.507]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:11.507 --> 03:00:12.769]  Look, it comes down to this.
[03:00:12.769 --> 03:00:16.412]  We're sitting on top, total economic fantasy land.
[03:00:16.412 --> 03:00:23.179]  Those of us that produce, those of us that try to build a strong country, we're demonized because we can put two and two together.
[03:00:24.332 --> 03:00:24.993]  We need to get ready.
[03:00:24.993 --> 03:00:27.034]  We need to try to educate as many people as possible.
[03:00:27.034 --> 03:00:31.638]  We also need to be physically getting geared up and ready as well.
[03:00:31.638 --> 03:00:33.500]  Let's go to Eric in Colorado.
[03:00:33.500 --> 03:00:35.202]  You're on the air with Martin Armstrong.
[03:00:35.202 --> 03:00:36.843]  Go ahead.
[03:00:36.843 --> 03:00:38.905]  Hey, good evening, sir.
[03:00:38.905 --> 03:00:39.445]  How are you doing?
[03:00:39.445 --> 03:00:41.487]  Good, go ahead.
[03:00:41.487 --> 03:00:47.753]  Hey, so I was just wondering if you guys caught last week's interview with Charles Koch?
[03:00:47.753 --> 03:00:49.374]  The liberal one that was running around?
[03:00:49.374 --> 03:00:50.135]  Yeah, I saw some of it.
[03:00:51.641 --> 03:00:57.207]  Yeah, where he pretty much came out on his vision of what kind of society makes people's lives better.
[03:00:57.207 --> 03:01:12.562]  And I quote for you, it is a society where people are too stupid and evil to run their own lives, but the people in power are more than capable of doing it because they are more intelligent.
[03:01:14.520 --> 03:01:18.262]  Yeah, the Kochs fund both sides of the political spectrum.
[03:01:18.262 --> 03:01:24.866]  The left likes to have this conspiracy theory that they run everything, but I mean, they're just part of the whole system in my view.
[03:01:24.866 --> 03:01:27.488]  What is your view on the Koch brothers overall?
[03:01:27.488 --> 03:01:32.911]  And I did see that statement, statements about how the elite are virtuous and we're all stupid scum.
[03:01:34.469 --> 03:01:38.113]  Oh, I mean, it's, you know, it's absolutely true that they think that.
[03:01:38.113 --> 03:01:43.818]  And during the interview, I mean, just basically, you know, if you watch a child, you can tell when a child is lying.
[03:01:43.818 --> 03:01:50.325]  And you can very clearly see where he is lying in some of the questions that Megyn Kelly ended up asking him.
[03:01:50.325 --> 03:01:50.785]  Sure, sure.
[03:01:50.785 --> 03:01:52.707]  Let me jump to Martin Armstrong and get his take.
[03:01:52.707 --> 03:01:53.248]  Thank you, Eric.
[03:01:53.248 --> 03:01:54.809]  Great, great point.
[03:01:54.809 --> 03:01:56.031]  Go ahead, Mr. Armstrong.
[03:01:57.136 --> 03:02:02.818]  No, look, I mean, the so-called elites, they're in trouble.
[03:02:02.818 --> 03:02:06.999]  And they really do not know what's going on and they can't control it.
[03:02:06.999 --> 03:02:11.520]  This is basically totally out of control at this point.
[03:02:11.520 --> 03:02:15.141]  And it's taking down everybody and, you know,
[03:02:15.836 --> 03:02:20.881]  That idea that somehow that those in power know what's better for us.
[03:02:20.881 --> 03:02:30.232]  I mean, this is the taking place in Europe, and you cannot elect any of the members of the Troiareuke.
[03:02:30.232 --> 03:02:32.474]  None of them stand for election.
[03:02:32.474 --> 03:02:36.719]  All of them effectively are really just dictatorship.
[03:02:37.697 --> 03:02:39.839]  And that's what this leads to.
[03:02:39.839 --> 03:02:50.288]  That they know better than we do, so therefore, we don't even understand that we should be electing these people, so they just take power.
[03:02:50.288 --> 03:02:51.689]  I agree with you, absolutely.
[03:02:51.689 --> 03:02:55.112]  Let's go ahead and go to Drake in California, then Eric in Michigan.
[03:02:55.112 --> 03:02:58.094]  Drake, you're on the air, thanks for holding.
[03:02:58.094 --> 03:02:58.955]  Hi, how you doing?
[03:02:58.955 --> 03:02:59.135]  Good.
[03:03:00.916 --> 03:03:16.062]  I just wanted to bring up a, um, I, for some reason I went back to Facebook for like, oh, about two minutes, and I just saw people from back home just over and over just scrolling and seeing people just bashing the Second Amendment.
[03:03:16.062 --> 03:03:27.347]  And, uh, one of the former teachers I used to teach with brought up this, uh, Michael Shea character from SNL, where he basically comes out and says, we need to get rid of the Second Amendment.
[03:03:28.533 --> 03:03:39.938]  The Constitution was written by a bunch of crazy old people that also said you can own people as well, so it's just a discredited document.
[03:03:39.938 --> 03:03:47.281]  Well, that's a... I mean, you're just making a point about that, this push to demonize gun owners for anything that somebody else does with a gun.
[03:03:47.281 --> 03:03:52.163]  That's like blaming somebody that runs over someone for a car, so you blame other drivers for it.
[03:03:52.163 --> 03:03:56.384]  It's kind of like this weird collectivist guilt thing that you see in totalitarian regimes.
[03:03:56.384 --> 03:03:57.985]  Martin Armstrong, do you have any comments on that?
[03:04:00.070 --> 03:04:08.857]  Well, the Second Amendment was largely there for one purpose, and that was basically to protect the people from government.
[03:04:08.857 --> 03:04:16.723]  That's really what it was about, and that there was a large
[03:04:18.899 --> 03:04:30.703]  The view of many, what they really wrote about at that point, Montesquieu, etc., was that what caused wars was the fact you had standing armies.
[03:04:30.703 --> 03:04:40.427]  And therefore the Second Amendment was to really place the arms in the hands of the people and that there would not be a standing army.
[03:04:40.427 --> 03:04:40.947]  That's right.
[03:04:40.947 --> 03:04:42.188]  Very quick, excellent answer.
[03:04:44.534 --> 03:04:45.515]  Well, you know your stuff.
[03:04:45.515 --> 03:04:47.316]  Martin Armstrong, look forward to having you back on.
[03:04:47.316 --> 03:04:49.037]  ArmstrongEconomics.com.
[03:04:49.037 --> 03:04:50.958]  Read your analysis and find out more.
[03:04:50.958 --> 03:04:53.119]  Thank you so much.
[03:04:53.119 --> 03:04:54.340]  Oh, thank you for inviting me.
[03:04:54.340 --> 03:04:55.060]  You bet.
[03:04:55.060 --> 03:04:58.602]  Leanne McAdoo, straight ahead for the next 55 minutes.
[03:04:58.602 --> 03:05:00.703]  Kit Daniels, InfoWars.com.
[03:05:00.703 --> 03:05:04.245]  Hillary Clinton said repealing the Second Amendment is worth considering.
[03:05:04.245 --> 03:05:14.311]  A presidential candidate attacked the Second Amendment during an October 16th town hall meeting in which she said we should consider a nationwide gun ban and a buyback program to eradicate private gun ownership.
[03:05:14.531 --> 03:05:19.575]  She said that America should practically outlaw guns just like Australia, Canada, and the UK.
[03:05:19.575 --> 03:05:27.160]  But she failed to mention that she supported shipping guns to Syrian rebels, the majority of whom are either ISIS militants or affiliated with the Islamic State.
[03:05:27.160 --> 03:05:35.907]  Senator Rand Paul even said she was the biggest cheerleader for distributing guns to these rebels linked to not only ISIS but also Al-Qaeda and the Al-Nusra Front.
[03:05:36.167 --> 03:05:42.613]  Time and time again, journalists have interviewed the rebels of Syria, and almost all of them admitted they have pledged allegiance to these radical Islamic groups.
[03:05:42.613 --> 03:05:49.560]  According to journalist Ben Reynolds, there's simply no real separation between moderate rebel groups and hardline Salafists allied with Al Qaeda.
[03:05:49.560 --> 03:05:54.124]  So, in other words, Hillary thinks that the Second Amendment only applies to Al Qaeda and ISIS.
[03:05:54.124 --> 03:05:57.968]  Once again, this is Kit Daniels with InfoWars.com, and keep checking back for more reports.
[03:05:58.368 --> 03:06:01.870]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[03:06:01.870 --> 03:06:10.114]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[03:06:10.114 --> 03:06:15.537]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[03:06:15.537 --> 03:06:18.058]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[03:06:18.058 --> 03:06:20.179]  We now have the synergistic solution.

[03:06:28.248 --> 03:06:29.349]  BrainForce is here.
[03:06:29.349 --> 03:06:31.570]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[03:06:31.570 --> 03:06:36.573]  You've probably noticed I've been more focused, less brain fog, more energy, and it's because of BrainForce.
[03:06:36.573 --> 03:06:39.855]  There's always hidden additives in your food, even organic food has hidden additives.
[03:06:39.855 --> 03:06:43.338]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[03:06:43.338 --> 03:06:45.319]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[03:06:45.319 --> 03:06:49.422]  It doesn't have stimulants, it doesn't have garbage in it, it has natural things that do it clean.
[03:06:49.422 --> 03:06:55.045]  You will find BrainForce and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[03:06:57.987 --> 03:07:02.290]  Many of the products at Infowarslife.com are true game changers.
[03:07:02.290 --> 03:07:06.532]  They are compounds that in many areas of the world are actually sold by prescription.
[03:07:06.532 --> 03:07:13.816]  But when we look at a product like Survival Shield Nason Iodine X2, it's something that really has been hiding in plain view for over a hundred years.
[03:07:13.996 --> 03:07:24.670]  The federal government mandated from the 20s until the 70s that iodine, a crude form of it, be added to table salt because of the incredible health problems that dietary deficiency in iodine was causing.
[03:07:24.670 --> 03:07:28.194]  I want to challenge the listeners who've not tried X2 for yourselves.
[03:07:28.194 --> 03:07:29.336]  What do you have to lose?
[03:07:29.336 --> 03:07:32.500]  You are the tip of the spear in the fight for human liberty and you're getting
[03:07:32.560 --> 03:07:32.900]  Thank you.
[03:08:05.573 --> 03:08:10.615]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[03:08:10.615 --> 03:08:14.777]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:08:14.777 --> 03:08:17.039]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:17.039 --> 03:08:21.501]  You are now entering the fourth hour overdrive and I am Leanne McAdoo.
[03:08:21.501 --> 03:08:26.123]  Jakari Jackson will be joining me in studio coming up later on in the show.
[03:08:26.123 --> 03:08:28.824]  But we've definitely got a jam-packed segment for you.
[03:08:28.824 --> 03:08:30.505]  I wanted to talk a little bit about
[03:08:30.925 --> 03:08:31.946]  What's going on in St.
[03:08:31.946 --> 03:08:32.767]  Louis, Missouri?
[03:08:47.000 --> 03:08:49.942]  Fire reaches a nuclear waste dump.
[03:08:49.942 --> 03:09:00.007]  It's a super fun site that was set up, you know, some years ago and there has been a fire burning underground for several years just about 1,200 feet away.
[03:09:00.007 --> 03:09:03.369]  Now the AP reports, beneath the surface of a St.
[03:09:03.369 --> 03:09:07.131]  Louis area landfill lurk two things that should never meet.
[03:09:07.131 --> 03:09:12.954]  A slow-burning fire and a cache of Cold War era nuclear waste separated by no more than 1,200 feet.
[03:09:13.974 --> 03:09:20.723]  Government officials have quietly adopted an emergency plan in case the smoldering embers ever reach the waste.
[03:09:20.723 --> 03:09:29.154]  It's a potentially catastrophic event that could send a plume of radioactive smoke over a densely populated area near the city's main airport.
[03:09:29.955 --> 03:09:47.339]  So this fire has been burning in the Bridgeton landfill since about 2010, but they've just developed this worst case scenario plan last year sometime, but they just publicized it last week and they were saying, you know, worst case scenario, this could happen between three to six months.
[03:09:47.339 --> 03:09:49.940]  And so a lot of people have been really concerned about this.
[03:09:49.940 --> 03:09:55.681]  I actually wanted to go cover this last year, but of course a lot of other things happened in St.
[03:09:55.681 --> 03:09:57.622]  Louis that kind of took precedent there.
[03:09:58.502 --> 03:10:13.155]  The cause of the fire is unknown, but it's causing a lot of concern and it's actually creating such an awful smell that the Attorney General actually sued Republic Services, which owns the landfill there.
[03:10:13.155 --> 03:10:16.238]  Now the waste there, the nuclear waste, was
[03:10:17.316 --> 03:10:18.236]  Don't worry.
[03:10:33.302 --> 03:10:38.245]  Back from the 1940s that they were working on, you know, the atomic bomb, all of this stuff.
[03:10:38.245 --> 03:10:46.109]  So then they just went ahead and illegally dumped it there, never thinking that there was going to be any urban sprawl and that people would be living there.
[03:10:46.109 --> 03:10:53.673]  I actually used to live quite close to this area, so I have a personal history with this Bridgeton landfill and all of that.
[03:10:53.673 --> 03:11:02.078]  It's causing huge concern to me because growing up we were always told, don't ever go by that lake, there's the three-eyed fish that you see in The Simpsons and all of that.
[03:11:03.679 --> 03:11:04.959]  But there's a lot.
[03:11:04.959 --> 03:11:05.160]  St.
[03:11:05.160 --> 03:11:10.221]  Louis is kind of a cesspool for this secret testing and this nuclear waste.
[03:11:10.221 --> 03:11:18.604]  They actually have a pile of nuclear waste as a tourist attraction in Weldon Springs, Missouri, which is in St.
[03:11:18.604 --> 03:11:24.206]  Charles County, Missouri, which is just, you know, just right down the road from this other nuclear waste facility.
[03:11:25.854 --> 03:11:31.719]  And then the New York Times reports in 1990, mountain of nuclear waste splits St.
[03:11:31.719 --> 03:11:33.381]  Louis and the suburbs.
[03:11:33.381 --> 03:11:34.802]  Yeah, you think?
[03:11:34.802 --> 03:11:36.904]  And that's exactly what the issue is.
[03:11:36.904 --> 03:11:38.005]  For some time in St.
[03:11:38.005 --> 03:11:46.113]  Louis, there was a great divide between the haves and the have-nots, and so they just dumped all these nuclear testing facilities there.
[03:11:46.954 --> 03:11:52.295]  All this nuclear waste, a lot of secret testing, and this actually came out in 2012.
[03:11:52.295 --> 03:11:54.255]  Secret Cold War tests in St.
[03:11:54.255 --> 03:11:56.556]  Louis raise concerns.
[03:11:56.556 --> 03:12:01.057]  Now, this is a social scientist there at the St.
[03:12:01.057 --> 03:12:02.317]  Louis Community College.
[03:12:02.317 --> 03:12:04.397]  Let me get her proper title, actually.
[03:12:04.397 --> 03:12:04.877]  She's a St.
[03:12:04.877 --> 03:12:12.619]  Louis Community College sociology professor, Lisa Martino-Taylor, and she's been doing a lot of research on this secret testing.
[03:12:13.479 --> 03:12:33.446]  In the mid-1950s, and again a decade later, the Army used motorized blowers atop a low-income housing high-rise at schools and from the backs of station wagons to send a potentially dangerous compound into the already hazy air in the predominantly black areas of St.
[03:12:33.446 --> 03:12:33.766]  Louis.
[03:12:34.446 --> 03:12:45.096]  And a lot of people that she interviewed, they remember this happening, they remember seeing the plumes of smoke, they remember seeing the station wagon blowing this dust out of the back, just through these areas.
[03:12:45.096 --> 03:12:51.683]  Now, local officials were told at the time that the government was testing a smoke screen that could shield St.
[03:12:51.683 --> 03:12:55.426]  Louis from aerial observation in case the Russians attacked.
[03:12:56.607 --> 03:13:03.593]  It sort of sounds a lot like what they say the geoengineering is for, to shield us.
[03:13:03.593 --> 03:13:10.838]  Just put that for many, solar radiation, or you know, it's the same type of thing.
[03:13:10.838 --> 03:13:17.023]  But now in 1994, the government said the tests were part of a biological weapons program
[03:13:17.523 --> 03:13:17.963]  And St.
[03:13:17.963 --> 03:13:24.366]  Louis was chosen because it bore some resemblance to Russian cities that the US might attack.
[03:13:24.366 --> 03:13:30.829]  The material being sprayed was zinc cadmium sulfide, a fine fluorescent powder.
[03:13:30.829 --> 03:13:33.651]  And so over the years, since this has happened,
[03:13:35.413 --> 03:13:37.894]  This professor has interviewed these people.
[03:13:37.894 --> 03:13:54.858]  There's been a number, just record outbreak of breast, thyroid, skin cancer, uterine cancer, kidney, and lung cancer, as well as three sets of conjoined twins right in the area that I told you about earlier where that lake is that no one was ever supposed to go swimming in.
[03:13:54.858 --> 03:14:03.840]  So these are all people that are somehow affiliated with the Mallincott Chemical Company, all of this secret testing there with the Army.
[03:14:04.540 --> 03:14:06.083]  And so I'm going to be in St.
[03:14:06.083 --> 03:14:09.408]  Louis next week trying to get as many interviews as I can.
[03:14:09.408 --> 03:14:16.720]  I got a lot of documentation there from another whistleblower with Mallinckrodt, so just really going to try and
[03:14:17.927 --> 03:14:20.068]  Let everyone know how big of a deal this is.
[03:14:20.068 --> 03:14:25.571]  It's not just the fact that there is a potential nuclear fallout that could be happening there in St.
[03:14:25.571 --> 03:14:29.553]  Louis as if they haven't had enough trouble there in their community.
[03:14:29.553 --> 03:14:33.915]  But now I want to go ahead and play a report from John Bowne that gets into this even more.
[03:14:33.915 --> 03:14:38.377]  The government has been doing secret testing on the American people since at least the 1950s.
[03:14:50.580 --> 03:15:00.289]  The United States military produced a classified film in 1952 documenting covert operations for offensive biological and chemical warfare.
[03:15:00.289 --> 03:15:06.115]  Biological and chemical warfare have two principal objectives.
[03:15:06.115 --> 03:15:13.262]  To reduce the enemy's production of food by destroying his crops and his food-producing farm animals.
[03:15:15.291 --> 03:15:23.702]  And to incapacitate the enemy's armed forces and that portion of his human population that directly supports them.
[03:15:23.702 --> 03:15:29.470]  The Navy is preparing to accomplish these objectives with both biological and chemical agents.
[03:15:30.225 --> 03:15:39.431]  On September 30, 2015, this film was finally declassified due to a FOIA request from GovernmentAttic.org.
[03:15:39.431 --> 03:15:39.972]  The U.S.
[03:15:39.972 --> 03:15:49.499]  Navy training film titled, Naval Concepts of Biological and Chemical Warfare, documents tests conducted on the western and eastern coastlines of the United States.
[03:15:50.439 --> 03:15:55.661]  Navy delivery and dispersion of the agents started with tests made in 1950.
[03:15:55.661 --> 03:16:11.086]  A rather crude spraying system was installed on a mine layer, which in September of that year, secretly cruised off California and sprayed some 50 gallons of biological simulant along a track two to five miles offshore.
[03:16:11.086 --> 03:16:14.507]  Within an hour, the simulant had been carried ashore by the wind.
[03:16:16.284 --> 03:16:24.150]  Sampling tests indicated that about 48 square miles of heavily populated area were contaminated.
[03:16:24.150 --> 03:16:32.517]  Had an infectious agent been used in the spray, there might have been 210,000 casualties.
[03:16:32.517 --> 03:16:38.902]  With that experiment successful, the southeast coast of the United States was selected for a larger scale test.
[03:16:40.541 --> 03:16:45.822]  The rather flat terrain would be favorable to wide dispersion of wind-borne particles.
[03:16:45.822 --> 03:16:52.824]  It was determined that the track along here, from 5 to 15 miles offshore, should do the job.
[03:16:52.824 --> 03:17:03.387]  Accordingly, in April 1952, the USS Tercel cruised along some 100 miles of coastline, spraying 250 pounds of fluorescent tracer particles.
[03:17:04.565 --> 03:17:04.985]  I think so.
[03:17:18.920 --> 03:17:28.210]  Proving that it is possible to contaminate extremely large land areas by releasing sprays at sea under the proper weather conditions.
[03:17:28.210 --> 03:17:38.881]  This dubious experiment known as Operation Sea Spray resulted in 11 people being admitted to the hospital with severe urinary tract infections and the death of Edward Nevin.
[03:17:39.241 --> 03:17:41.843]  A man recovering from prostate surgery.
[03:17:41.843 --> 03:17:54.251]  The military never responded to the Stanford University Hospital doctor's investigation and the incident went down as the first recorded outbreak of serratia in the history of microbiology.
[03:17:54.491 --> 03:18:07.954]  The now declassified Navy film depicts the beginning of what would spiral into the military testing biological warfare at least 239 times in major cities up and down the coastline of the United States.
[03:18:07.954 --> 03:18:17.477]  The tests went on as planned until in 1969 Richard Nixon issued an order to end the germ warfare operations and the stockpiling of biological agents.
[03:18:17.477 --> 03:18:18.637]  As a result of the horrors
[03:18:18.757 --> 03:18:19.418]  We're good to go.
[03:18:37.637 --> 03:18:38.157]  The U.S.
[03:18:38.157 --> 03:18:46.703]  military's covert operations broke that code secretly and almost immediately, and did so to its own citizens, no less.
[03:18:46.703 --> 03:18:57.591]  Is it any wonder that the chemtrails now blanketing our skies are being purposefully overlooked by a tyrannical government bent on soft-killing its own citizens once again?
[03:18:57.591 --> 03:18:59.953]  Biological warfare?
[03:19:00.793 --> 03:19:02.495]  What do they expect me to do about it?
[03:19:02.495 --> 03:19:05.378]  It's not my headache.
[03:19:05.378 --> 03:19:06.418]  You're wrong.
[03:19:06.418 --> 03:19:10.822]  You had better find out the facts about biological warfare or B.W.
[03:19:10.822 --> 03:19:15.787]  It can be aimed at you and your home.
[03:19:15.787 --> 03:19:18.009]  Or at work.
[03:19:18.009 --> 03:19:20.531]  At your food crop.
[03:19:20.531 --> 03:19:21.612]  Your livestock.
[03:19:21.612 --> 03:19:23.053]  John Bowne for Infowars.com
[03:19:25.337 --> 03:19:26.498]  And so there you go.
[03:19:26.498 --> 03:19:35.881]  You'll recall last year, Obama, John Kerry, they were trying to send us to war with Syria over these alleged chemical weapons testing by Assad on his own people.
[03:19:35.881 --> 03:19:42.664]  And now there's irrefutable evidence that chemical weapons have been tested right here in America on American people.
[03:19:42.664 --> 03:19:46.526]  Not only by private companies, but also by the U.S.
[03:19:46.526 --> 03:19:47.206]  government.
[03:19:47.206 --> 03:19:49.027]  So there you go.
[03:19:49.027 --> 03:19:49.547]  Stick around.
[03:19:49.547 --> 03:19:54.629]  We're going to be talking about Bernie Sanders' plan to raise taxes on the American family.
[03:19:55.369 --> 03:19:58.870]  USA!
[03:19:58.870 --> 03:20:03.251]  Do you lay awake at night and worry about the health and safety of you and your loved ones?
[03:20:03.251 --> 03:20:07.332]  Do you wonder what would happen if you weren't able to get to a hospital or doctor?
[03:20:07.332 --> 03:20:12.793]  How can you keep your family safe against the deadly pathogens that are beginning to emerge in the world today?
[03:20:12.793 --> 03:20:16.353]  Give yourself peace of mind with Supernatural Silver.
[03:20:16.353 --> 03:20:23.255]  Supernatural Silver is turning heads around the world as a new weapon in the fight against bacteria, viruses, and fungus.

[03:21:02.137 --> 03:21:11.724]  And it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and help children focus.
[03:21:11.724 --> 03:21:14.426]  All of our children are hit with modern mind control.
[03:21:14.426 --> 03:21:18.008]  Television, music, fast food, GMOs, sugars, you name it.
[03:21:18.008 --> 03:21:24.253]  Young humans have not yet developed their nervous system and are being hammered daily by globalist concoctions.
[03:21:24.253 --> 03:21:28.956]  It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down and then are put on dangerous psychotropic drugs.
[03:21:29.276 --> 03:21:35.661]  Working with my team we set out to find the best formula with the highest quality ingredients that children would actually like and take.
[03:21:35.661 --> 03:21:43.328]  We worked with the leading manufacturer in nutritional supplements that are safe for children to bring you the most affordable and powerful calming formula out there.
[03:21:43.328 --> 03:21:50.754]  Introducing Child Ease with herbs and calming extracts like chamomile and lemon balm and essential nutrients that taste great.

[03:22:58.473 --> 03:23:02.876]  Most of us already know that taking a fish oil supplement to boost omega-3s is a good idea.
[03:23:02.876 --> 03:23:06.940]  But did you know that about 60% of Americans are actually deficient in omega-3s?
[03:23:06.940 --> 03:23:11.163]  Did you know that most fish oil products contain only about 25% omega-3s and the remaining 75% is undesirable fish fat?
[03:23:14.306 --> 03:23:19.529]  Heck, did you know that more than 90% of fish oil supplements sold in the USA are not even made here?
[03:23:19.529 --> 03:23:28.233]  If you want to boost your Omega-3s using the finest American-made fish oil, check out Nutrigold fish oil supplements on www.fishoil.best.

[03:23:54.991 --> 03:23:56.812]  Well you were sleeping They came and took it all away
[03:24:13.382 --> 03:24:15.303]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:24:15.303 --> 03:24:19.004]  I'm Leanne McAdoo hosting the 4th Hour Overdrive.
[03:24:19.004 --> 03:24:21.745]  Now this just in from Kit Daniels.
[03:24:21.745 --> 03:24:24.766]  Migrants shut down the English Channel Tunnel.
[03:24:24.766 --> 03:24:33.068]  Hundreds of migrants have stormed the English Channel's Eurotunnel today, forcing train traffic to shut down in both directions for two hours.
[03:24:33.068 --> 03:24:37.310]  Some of the migrants have been using diversion tactics to distract the police.
[03:24:37.990 --> 03:24:40.031]  While others have attempted to slip through the tunnel.
[03:24:40.031 --> 03:24:47.455]  A Eurotunnel spokesperson tells the BBC that the migrants are coming in waves to occupy the police.
[03:24:47.455 --> 03:24:51.637]  Then another wave comes and another until there is no more police.
[03:24:51.637 --> 03:25:00.021]  And of course, as we've been reporting, these migrants are willing to risk their lives to enter the UK due to the nation's generous welfare program.
[03:25:00.021 --> 03:25:02.462]  The UK isn't alone, of course.
[03:25:02.462 --> 03:25:03.063]  Other Western
[03:25:04.580 --> 03:25:14.165]  Countries are also giving free housing, food, and jobs to the migrants, and not to mention everybody else who is entering our country illegally as well.
[03:25:14.165 --> 03:25:17.706]  And if you have a problem with that, you are racist.
[03:25:17.706 --> 03:25:29.932]  And I'm sure that's probably going to be the theme of this upcoming election cycle, because you're probably racist if you do not agree with Bernie Sanders' plan to give freebies to everyone.
[03:25:29.932 --> 03:25:31.633]  Now, this is on the Drudge Report today.
[03:25:31.633 --> 03:25:33.314]  Sanders is reporting that
[03:25:34.246 --> 03:25:34.346]  He
[03:25:49.758 --> 03:25:49.838]  I'm
[03:26:12.373 --> 03:26:21.216]  Because everyone is sort of coming out and getting very, very nervous about his Democratic Socialism, he's planning a major speech on Democratic Socialism.
[03:26:21.216 --> 03:26:24.297]  This is what he has told his Iowa supporters.
[03:26:24.297 --> 03:26:28.719]  The Vermont Senator says, I think we have some explaining and work to do.
[03:26:28.719 --> 03:26:33.540]  Democratic Socialism makes some people very, very nervous, you think?
[03:26:33.540 --> 03:26:34.241]  Now, Sanders
[03:26:35.421 --> 03:26:35.801]  I don't
[03:26:54.502 --> 03:27:02.744]  In collusion with the government, if not even above Congress, with the TPP, we have the heads of 600 corporations negotiating that big trade deal.
[03:27:02.744 --> 03:27:09.366]  Congress doesn't even have a say in it, can't even work in, you know, something that would be best for the American people.
[03:27:09.366 --> 03:27:16.187]  So, you know, right now we've got these corporations, we're working with them, and then eventually the government takes them over.
[03:27:16.187 --> 03:27:19.248]  Now, you know, you know who else called himself a socialist?
[03:27:19.248 --> 03:27:19.588]  Hitler!
[03:27:20.865 --> 03:27:31.469]  So I'm going to go ahead and talk about the communist takeover of America, the 45 declared goals, these communist goals, because there's no difference between socialism and communism.
[03:27:31.469 --> 03:27:34.150]  They're both headed to the same place.
[03:27:34.150 --> 03:27:38.232]  And I'm going to go ahead and just sum up Bernie Sanders' plan for you.
[03:27:38.232 --> 03:27:44.034]  It basically boils down to who needs freedom when you've got freebies?
[03:27:44.034 --> 03:27:44.895]  So there you go.
[03:27:44.895 --> 03:27:47.256]  Now you don't even need to pay attention to his speech.
[03:27:48.558 --> 03:27:53.885]  But another question is, why are so many young people so into Bernie Sanders' message?
[03:27:53.885 --> 03:27:55.307]  They're so pumped for him.
[03:27:55.307 --> 03:28:03.759]  Here, everyone's talking about we need to change the changing tide of the country, and here they're all rooting for this 70-something-year-old old white guy.
[03:28:04.179 --> 03:28:09.043]  Well, could that be because of the indoctrination at public schools?
[03:28:09.043 --> 03:28:13.386]  That is one of the major points of the Communist goals.
[03:28:13.386 --> 03:28:15.427]  Now, this is coming from The Naked Communist.
[03:28:15.427 --> 03:28:22.532]  It's a 1958 book written by ex-FBI agent, author and political theorist, Cleon Skousen.
[03:28:25.839 --> 03:28:40.369]  So I'm going to go ahead and start with like number 15 because obviously this came out in the 60s or it was read into the congressional record in the 60s so some of those things were kind of in the past but just take a listen and see if this doesn't sound like the present day.
[03:28:40.369 --> 03:28:42.811]  Capture one or both of the political parties in the US.
[03:28:43.291 --> 03:28:45.012]  Get control of the schools.
[03:28:45.012 --> 03:28:49.655]  Use them as transmission belts for socialism and current communist propaganda.
[03:28:49.655 --> 03:28:51.056]  Infiltrate the press.
[03:28:51.056 --> 03:28:54.818]  Gain control of key positions in radio, TV, and motion pictures.
[03:28:54.818 --> 03:28:56.459]  Discredit American culture.
[03:28:56.459 --> 03:28:58.541]  Degrade all forms of artistic expression.
[03:28:59.381 --> 03:29:01.423]  Eliminate laws governing obscenity.
[03:29:01.423 --> 03:29:12.990]  Don't violate free speech and free press because that's how they pump in all of this pornography, degeneracy, promiscuity, and promote it as normal.
[03:29:12.990 --> 03:29:17.994]  Infiltrate the churches and replace revealed religion with social religion.
[03:29:17.994 --> 03:29:19.395]  Eliminate prayer in school.
[03:29:19.395 --> 03:29:21.256]  I mean, it just goes on and on and on.
[03:29:21.256 --> 03:29:26.319]  We're basically living in this communist takeover today.
[03:29:26.319 --> 03:29:28.781]  Emphasize the need to raise children away from the family.
[03:29:30.102 --> 03:29:33.684]  So it goes on and on and on, but that's basically what we're dealing with today.
[03:29:33.684 --> 03:29:42.111]  My question is, is the establishment running a commie there to just kind of test the waters, see if we're all ready for this takeover?
[03:29:42.111 --> 03:29:43.291]  RT seems to think so.
[03:29:43.291 --> 03:29:47.975]  They say America is a bomb waiting to explode.
[03:29:47.975 --> 03:29:50.977]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[03:29:50.977 --> 03:29:54.600]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:29:58.717 --> 03:30:00.818]  Kit Daniels, Infowars.com.
[03:30:00.818 --> 03:30:05.959]  Did you know that since 1960, the number of married adults has decreased from 72% down to 51?
[03:30:05.959 --> 03:30:08.980]  In other words, barely half of all adults in the U.S.
[03:30:08.980 --> 03:30:10.861]  are married, which is a record low.
[03:30:10.861 --> 03:30:17.483]  Case in point, a Catholic pastor recently revealed he's only performing five marriages a year, down from 35 over 25 years ago.
[03:30:17.483 --> 03:30:20.644]  And the pastor, Charles Pope, said other priests have had similar experiences.
[03:30:20.644 --> 03:30:24.345]  But why are men shying away from marriage and even relationships with women in general?
[03:30:24.345 --> 03:30:26.046]  Well, Pastor Pope pointed out the obvious.
[03:30:26.306 --> 03:30:30.109]  Radical feminism is destroying marriage by driving a wedge between men and women.
[03:30:30.109 --> 03:30:38.335]  For one thing, thanks to feminism, many men are now so terrified of being labeled rapists that they shy away from showing any interest towards women, even women who hate feminism.
[03:30:38.335 --> 03:30:42.838]  And because of that, many women now complain they cannot find real men who have the confidence to approach them.
[03:30:43.038 --> 03:30:48.020]  There's a video report on InfoWars.com entitled, Why Men Are Giving Up on Marriage, which breaks it all down.
[03:30:48.020 --> 03:30:51.821]  And you can also find the video on our new YouTube channel called Resistance News.
[03:30:51.821 --> 03:30:58.084]  Once again, this is Kit Daniels with InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.TV, and keep checking back for more news and reports.

[03:31:00.524 --> 03:31:02.225]  Oil of oregano formulation.
[03:31:02.225 --> 03:31:07.806]  We have now procured the most high quality and potent forms of oregano oil on the market.
[03:31:07.806 --> 03:31:16.168]  A highly advanced nutraceutical form of this key herb that has been traditionally used by civilizations for thousands of years to promote health.
[03:31:16.168 --> 03:31:22.289]  Sourced from top leading manufacturers to ensure a concentrated level of bioactive ingredients.
[03:31:22.289 --> 03:31:24.650]  Extracted directly from the wild herb.
[03:31:25.290 --> 03:31:26.211]  We're good to go.
[03:31:49.745 --> 03:31:52.209]  Now available at Infowarslife.com.

[03:31:56.555 --> 03:32:01.862]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[03:32:01.862 --> 03:32:06.869]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors,
[03:32:06.869 --> 03:32:07.510]  We're good to go.
[03:32:28.280 --> 03:32:29.400]  BrainForce is here.
[03:32:29.400 --> 03:32:31.621]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[03:32:31.621 --> 03:32:36.603]  You've probably noticed I've been more focused, less brain fog, more energy, and it's because of BrainForce.
[03:32:36.603 --> 03:32:39.764]  There's always hidden additives in your food, even organic food has hidden additives.
[03:32:39.764 --> 03:32:43.365]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[03:32:43.365 --> 03:32:45.366]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[03:32:45.366 --> 03:32:47.466]  It doesn't have stimulants, it doesn't have garbage in it.
[03:32:47.466 --> 03:32:49.467]  It has natural things that do it clean.

[03:33:11.241 --> 03:33:16.192]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:19.392 --> 03:33:21.993]  Welcome back to the 4th Hour Overdrive.
[03:33:21.993 --> 03:33:23.333]  I am Leigh Ann McAdoo.
[03:33:23.333 --> 03:33:26.034]  Joining me now is Jakari Jackson.
[03:33:26.034 --> 03:33:28.495]  Jakari, welcome back from your staycation.
[03:33:28.495 --> 03:33:31.236]  Good to have you back in the building.
[03:33:31.236 --> 03:33:34.877]  Now I wanted to just kind of, let's go back to the last break.
[03:33:34.877 --> 03:33:43.880]  I was kind of talking about Bernie Sanders being a plant, the establishment testing out potential socialist dictator to be put in.
[03:33:43.880 --> 03:33:47.062]  And going back to the naked communists, 45
[03:33:48.638 --> 03:33:50.461]  Declared goals for this takeover.
[03:34:05.020 --> 03:34:14.733]  Does that not sound like... That sounds like modern times, and I'm glad you brought that up, because somebody told me about that, the Naked Communist, a few years ago.
[03:34:14.733 --> 03:34:21.201]  And, you know, I haven't had a chance to read the full book, but just what you bring up right here, all these bullet points, I think that's very...
[03:34:22.182 --> 03:34:27.105]  You know, pertinent for anybody today, you know, especially some kid in, you know, class who's being taught all these things.
[03:34:27.105 --> 03:34:35.171]  If you just flash it on a screen, just look at this PowerPoint presentation of all these points and then point out how these are in use today.
[03:34:35.171 --> 03:34:36.011]  Present day, right?
[03:34:36.011 --> 03:34:38.073]  And Don Talazar and I were talking about that before.
[03:34:38.073 --> 03:34:42.196]  He said, you know, I always kind of like to go back and just check the sources on these things.
[03:34:42.196 --> 03:34:46.519]  And I said, the source is the reality of our present day condition.
[03:34:46.519 --> 03:34:47.319]  It's happening.
[03:34:47.319 --> 03:34:48.100]  It's unfolding.
[03:34:48.880 --> 03:34:51.682]  And, you know, obviously it's not something that's going to happen overnight.
[03:34:51.682 --> 03:35:02.128]  These things take decades because you've got to indoctrinate the children, you've got to be able to change the churches, infiltrate how the people practice their religion.
[03:35:02.128 --> 03:35:04.730]  Like I said, it's over time, you know, because
[03:35:05.390 --> 03:35:10.272]  Your grandparents, your great-grandparents would see something like this, like, oh, no, this is not going to happen.
[03:35:10.272 --> 03:35:14.833]  But, you know, every year or every, you know, few decades, you know, people get more distracted.
[03:35:14.833 --> 03:35:15.814]  They get more entertained.
[03:35:15.814 --> 03:35:17.374]  And I'm not saying entertainment's a bad thing.
[03:35:17.374 --> 03:35:21.716]  I'm just saying people have less interest in the things that affect them every day.
[03:35:21.716 --> 03:35:25.377]  Like, I was talking to some guy, I think, when we went up on our last trip to Oregon,
[03:35:25.897 --> 03:35:33.822]  And I was telling him, you know, it used to be just what you did for men to go to the town hall meetings and to discuss and actually be a part of things.
[03:35:33.822 --> 03:35:40.967]  And, you know, afterwards they could go, you know, to the bar or whatever, but they made it a part of their day to be active in things that affect them in their everyday lives.
[03:35:40.967 --> 03:35:46.831]  And nowadays people will vote somebody in the office and just assume that this person has their best interest at heart.
[03:35:47.051 --> 03:35:47.391]  Right.
[03:35:47.391 --> 03:35:49.812]  Total laziness and buying into the propaganda.
[03:35:49.812 --> 03:35:52.292]  That's why year after year we hear the same thing.
[03:35:52.292 --> 03:35:53.312]  Hope and change.
[03:35:53.312 --> 03:35:54.353]  There's never any hope.
[03:35:54.353 --> 03:35:55.913]  There's never any change.
[03:35:55.913 --> 03:36:00.034]  It's the same thing and people buy it every single election cycle.
[03:36:00.034 --> 03:36:09.636]  And RT is reporting, which it kind of fits in with this communist goals, RT says, America is a bomb waiting to explode.
[03:36:09.636 --> 03:36:15.757]  And it's kind of an op-ed piece basically spelling out how America is ripe for the takeover because
[03:36:17.338 --> 03:36:21.080]  We're fragile and they only use four sources.
[03:36:21.080 --> 03:36:24.341]  So we got the destruction of farms and reliable food source.
[03:36:24.341 --> 03:36:29.243]  The average American is a long way from food when the shops are closed.
[03:36:29.243 --> 03:36:32.824]  We've got a weak economic system thanks to coming off the gold standard.
[03:36:32.824 --> 03:36:36.126]  So our economic system is a little more than froth.
[03:36:37.346 --> 03:36:42.010]  Morals in decline and of course Americans increasingly on mind-altering drugs.
[03:36:42.010 --> 03:36:44.352]  So we're easily controllable.
[03:36:44.352 --> 03:36:45.133]  We really are.
[03:36:45.133 --> 03:36:51.218]  At any moment one little button could be pushed and this country could just decline.
[03:36:51.218 --> 03:36:54.521]  And when you're talking about the food sources it never ceases to amaze me.
[03:36:54.881 --> 03:36:55.301]  No, we're good.
[03:37:17.219 --> 03:37:19.103]  You know, go out to, you know, some restaurant.
[03:37:19.103 --> 03:37:26.700]  If I can go out to the barbecue joint and eat something, I'd have something that could keep me alive and fed for the next couple days, but a lot of people don't even do that anymore.
[03:37:27.102 --> 03:37:34.463]  I know, mine's really pathetic, you talking about empty refrigerators right now because I'm getting ready to do the cleanse with Emmy.
[03:37:34.463 --> 03:37:36.784]  Tell us about that cleanse.
[03:37:36.784 --> 03:37:39.524]  Well, I don't know about it at the moment.
[03:37:39.524 --> 03:37:45.266]  I just know I'm going to be hungry and cranky and really wishing that I could have some coffee.
[03:37:45.266 --> 03:37:51.687]  So everyone that I work with, I apologize in the future for my behavior in the coming days.
[03:37:52.427 --> 03:37:58.171]  Uh, but let's go ahead and talk about, you know, another thing that people are not planning for is the future of jobs.
[03:37:58.171 --> 03:38:01.593]  Uh, we obviously know the economy is, is really in a standstill.
[03:38:01.593 --> 03:38:03.595]  It's not a downward spiral.
[03:38:03.595 --> 03:38:14.042]  And a lot of our, um, our potential presidential candidates, they are not talking about this robot takeover and what are they going to do for jobs?
[03:38:14.042 --> 03:38:22.027]  They're kind of thinking in this old school way of creating these jobs, but we're moving into the future where now our jobs are going to be automated.
[03:38:22.667 --> 03:38:32.057]  And people always hear, like, they'll say, they'll hear what you just said right there, Leigh-Anne, and they'll be like, well, you guys talking about the Terminator and all this other... I'm like, no, think about something very basic.
[03:38:32.057 --> 03:38:35.081]  We used to have Blockbuster and now we have Redbox.
[03:38:35.081 --> 03:38:38.284]  And that means people who used to work at a Blockbuster no longer have a job.
[03:38:38.624 --> 03:38:59.809]  And this is going more and more around, you know, I go to the airport now, I spend a lot of time in the airports, and we travel all the time, and I see these Best Buy kiosks where you can buy phones, you can buy headphones, and yes, it's convenient and all that, but people need to understand that as these things become more automated, that means less jobs for workers, except for the workers who work in the factories assembling the robots so they have their jobs.
[03:38:59.809 --> 03:39:01.490]  Right, cleaning and shining the robots.
[03:39:02.410 --> 03:39:04.812]  And so I think this one is out of Bloomberg.
[03:39:04.812 --> 03:39:09.976]  Social skills are the last line of defense for humans seeking work.
[03:39:09.976 --> 03:39:15.261]  So this is the one thing that helps us stand out from the robots that are set to take our jobs.
[03:39:15.261 --> 03:39:16.622]  So job polarization.
[03:39:16.622 --> 03:39:25.089]  Efforts to make agents of artificial intelligence more sentient threaten to erode one of the biggest competitive advantages humans have over robots.
[03:39:25.529 --> 03:39:35.794]  The ability to summon social skills, including reading a person's feelings, managing emotions, working in teams and communicating effectively to complete a task.
[03:39:35.794 --> 03:39:45.799]  So now they are training artificial intelligence to be able to do these things because this is our kind of our last man standing skill that we have to be able to find a job in the future.
[03:39:45.799 --> 03:39:48.200]  And now look at this competing headline.
[03:39:49.423 --> 03:39:53.007]  Social media making millennials less social.
[03:39:53.007 --> 03:40:05.920]  So our one last thing that we have to like fight against the rise of the robots and the robot takeover is being destroyed because people cannot put down their devices.
[03:40:05.920 --> 03:40:08.502]  They don't know how to interact in social settings anymore.
[03:40:08.502 --> 03:40:09.964]  They can't make eye contact.
[03:40:11.604 --> 03:40:17.966]  Yeah, I think it's getting to the point where people are more comfortable talking to a machine or through a machine.
[03:40:17.966 --> 03:40:18.226]  Right.
[03:40:18.226 --> 03:40:28.489]  Because even, I believe it's in Japan, they have those animatronic robots at the at the hotel reception desk now, which look, you know, relatively lifelike.
[03:40:28.489 --> 03:40:33.150]  So you can go and have a conversation with this lifelike type thing that you know is a machine.
[03:40:33.150 --> 03:40:35.691]  And I guess people are a little more open to that.
[03:40:35.691 --> 03:40:36.111]  I don't know.
[03:40:36.291 --> 03:40:45.119]  Well, they say that normal sexual relations, what we know now, are going to be seen as archaic by 2050, because there are going to be sex bots.
[03:40:45.119 --> 03:40:49.362]  And that's going to be the new norm, is having relationships with robots.
[03:40:49.362 --> 03:40:52.345]  It's so trendy not to have relations.
[03:40:52.345 --> 03:40:55.087]  It's like I was in Demolition Man.
[03:40:55.087 --> 03:40:58.651]  But Stallone, he comes back after 50 years or whatever, he's been frozen.
[03:40:58.651 --> 03:41:00.672]  He sends you books like, hey, you want to have sex?
[03:41:00.672 --> 03:41:01.193]  He's like, yeah!
[03:41:02.512 --> 03:41:02.852]  I'm a man!
[03:41:23.467 --> 03:41:25.269]  By 2018, I guess.
[03:41:25.269 --> 03:41:26.290]  They're going to be everywhere.
[03:41:26.290 --> 03:41:28.132]  So that's just a couple of years away.
[03:41:28.132 --> 03:41:32.817]  Whoever is our next president is going to have to be dealing with this reality.
[03:41:32.817 --> 03:41:42.307]  And we, the people, are going to need to be doing our own part to make sure that we are not easily replaced with these robots.
[03:41:42.307 --> 03:41:44.390]  How are you developing your human
[03:41:46.070 --> 03:41:55.935]  Well, you just want to be more, you know, more social because even sometimes I have to take, you know, a conscious effort of doing that, you know, and you just go out and do different things.
[03:41:55.935 --> 03:42:02.039]  Like I do meetups and I take classes, you know, I've done that jujitsu and boxing and other things, just trying to be more social.
[03:42:02.039 --> 03:42:03.900]  And like you said, just being able to.
[03:42:04.780 --> 03:42:34.040]  Speak coherently, you know, look people in the eye when you go to a job interview just basic things like that I guess there's somewhat falling by the wayside and also the way you present yourself, you know, I see More and more people they'll go to a job interview wearing, you know, whatever type of clothes, you know You don't even dress up in a nice shirt or a blouse Anymore, you know, it's a lot of things that are just going to the overall degradation of society I remember guys I had a job one time it wasn't a fancy job, but guy came in with his pants sagging and I'm just like
[03:42:34.800 --> 03:42:35.941]  Bro.
[03:42:35.941 --> 03:42:37.102]  Not hired.
[03:42:37.102 --> 03:42:40.305]  Yeah, then it's gonna be everybody else's fault the guy didn't get a job.
[03:42:40.305 --> 03:42:40.646]  Right.
[03:42:40.646 --> 03:42:44.769]  And he walks around with his freaking Scooby-Doo underwear hanging out.
[03:42:44.769 --> 03:42:46.671]  Well, that's, that's, you're exactly right.
[03:42:46.671 --> 03:42:49.754]  I think that's so important for us to fight back against
[03:42:51.229 --> 03:43:05.723]  The ghettos that we're being corralled into of trying to stay here on this social network and keep up with the Joneses via Instagram where people put this fake life out there and people are like getting plastic surgery now so they can look better in their selfies.
[03:43:05.723 --> 03:43:15.031]  It's a total false fake reality and while you're living in that dream world, the real world around you is being
[03:43:15.742 --> 03:43:16.022]  I think so.
[03:43:36.127 --> 03:43:36.847]  Yeah, absolutely.
[03:43:36.847 --> 03:43:39.708]  So I think I'm going to be doing like a yoga teacher training over the winter.
[03:43:39.708 --> 03:43:49.330]  So rather than sitting at home by myself and drinking wine and getting fat and being sad, I'm going to go work out and go meet people who are also trying to do something positive.
[03:44:06.054 --> 03:44:23.683]  Kind of spiritually mentally physically put that in the forefront rather than just sitting at home watching TV or whatever getting back out there in the real world So that's that's how I'm doing my part to be a free human and it's advancing on free world that we're living in.
[03:44:23.683 --> 03:44:24.964]  So what else you got over there?
[03:44:25.643 --> 03:44:26.724]  Well, I have a few things.
[03:44:26.724 --> 03:44:31.707]  You know, we've been talking a lot about the Second Amendment, obviously, and we do that a lot on this show.
[03:44:31.707 --> 03:44:35.889]  But this is a case in point of, you know, being armed at the proper time.
[03:44:35.889 --> 03:44:42.574]  Because, you know, a lot of times they will show, you know, the very unfortunate tragedies, you know, like the theater shootings or the school shootings.
[03:44:42.574 --> 03:44:44.515]  And yes, those things do happen.
[03:44:44.515 --> 03:44:51.920]  But when you talk about rifles, especially assault rifles, those things are used in very statistically low numbers in the United States of America.
[03:44:51.920 --> 03:44:53.120]  I know they're very high profile.
[03:44:53.120 --> 03:44:53.961]  You hear a lot about them.
[03:44:54.321 --> 03:44:56.161]  But they don't happen all that often.
[03:44:56.161 --> 03:45:05.603]  And to that end, we have this article, I believe we have it on the site in some derivative, but it's basically a pastor in Detroit who shot somebody who was attacking him with a brick.
[03:45:05.603 --> 03:45:11.305]  You know, after we saw Charleston and all the things that surrounded that, Leanne, you know, people took attention to this.
[03:45:11.305 --> 03:45:15.025]  Like, okay, we don't want some crazy guy to come in our church and kill our congregation.
[03:45:15.025 --> 03:45:17.406]  So the pastor took it upon himself to be armed.
[03:45:17.406 --> 03:45:22.487]  Somebody walked in with a brick, was trying to physically attack him, and he pulled out his firearm and shot the guy.
[03:45:22.947 --> 03:45:24.768]  And you were showing me something earlier today.
[03:45:24.768 --> 03:45:25.629]  Where was that?
[03:45:25.629 --> 03:45:28.370]  That somebody was attacked by a knife?
[03:45:28.370 --> 03:45:30.832]  Yeah, this was in Jerusalem, actually.
[03:45:30.832 --> 03:45:35.955]  And it was a terror at the bus stop caught on a CCTV camera.
[03:45:35.955 --> 03:45:39.337]  And it was, it's actually pretty graphic.
[03:45:39.337 --> 03:45:42.238]  So I mean, if the guys want to play the video, if you're watching us,
[03:45:43.519 --> 03:45:45.901]  at Infowars.com forward slash show.
[03:45:45.901 --> 03:45:48.163]  You can see the video.
[03:45:48.163 --> 03:45:53.668]  But it was basically a Palestinian terrorist ramming his car into a bus stop.
[03:45:53.668 --> 03:45:59.913]  He gets out and he begins hacking away at people who are sitting there at the bus stop.
[03:45:59.913 --> 03:46:02.255]  And I believe a rabbi was murdered.
[03:46:02.255 --> 03:46:04.157]  Eight others were hurt.
[03:46:04.157 --> 03:46:10.462]  And so you're watching this on this CCTV, the footage, and it's just like, wow,
[03:46:11.523 --> 03:46:24.131]  I mean, seconds are going by and these people are being attacked with a meat cleaver and then all of a sudden someone comes into view and he shoots the guy and it takes several bullets to take this guy down.
[03:46:24.131 --> 03:46:29.354]  Oh wow, you mean it takes more than one bullet to kill a guy sometimes or to make him stay on the ground?
[03:46:29.354 --> 03:46:31.916]  Heaven forbid you have some ammo.
[03:46:32.096 --> 03:46:32.556]  Yeah, this
[03:46:50.854 --> 03:46:52.175]  RABID ANTIGUN PROPONENT
[03:47:13.411 --> 03:47:18.014]  You can see this video of this guy who rams into people using his car as a weapon.
[03:47:18.014 --> 03:47:20.415]  Somebody else has to come up with a firearm.
[03:47:20.415 --> 03:47:21.256]  And a meat cleaver.
[03:47:21.256 --> 03:47:24.238]  Yeah, so you got a guy who's using his car as a weapon.
[03:47:24.238 --> 03:47:26.499]  He's using a meat cleaver as a weapon.
[03:47:26.499 --> 03:47:38.346]  But had this guy accidentally had a little pocket gun fell out of his clothes there and shot somebody accidentally, just like a ricochet, all they would have talked about was the gun.
[03:47:38.346 --> 03:47:39.967]  If this guy would have shot somebody with a BB gun,
[03:47:40.367 --> 03:47:44.589]  All they would have talked about was the gun, not the car, not the meat cleaver.
[03:47:44.589 --> 03:47:46.390]  All they would have talked about was the gun.
[03:47:46.390 --> 03:47:52.012]  So this is another example, just like we saw with Elliot Rodger out in California, I believe it was.
[03:47:52.012 --> 03:47:57.395]  Elliot Rodger, he shot somebody, he stabbed somebody, or multiple people, and he ran people over with his car.
[03:47:57.395 --> 03:48:00.056]  The only thing they talked about the next day, let's ban the gun.
[03:48:00.396 --> 03:48:00.736]  Right.
[03:48:00.736 --> 03:48:04.898]  You know, let's not talk about why this guy, what led this guy to these type of situations.
[03:48:04.898 --> 03:48:08.279]  Let's not talk about people he killed with a car or with a knife.
[03:48:08.279 --> 03:48:10.099]  Only thing they focused on was the gun.
[03:48:10.099 --> 03:48:17.322]  And they continue to do this, whether it's Hillary or Obama or Bloomberg or any of these other guys who live surrounded by armed security.
[03:48:17.322 --> 03:48:20.403]  And one more point on that, Leigh, I know you got some other stuff you want to talk about.
[03:48:20.843 --> 03:48:24.906]  But as I've seen Obama a few times, you know, out and about.
[03:48:24.906 --> 03:48:27.527]  I've never actually met him, but I've seen like his motorcade and stuff.
[03:48:27.527 --> 03:48:29.308]  He came here to Austin.
[03:48:29.308 --> 03:48:34.271]  Myself and Kit went out there to see him at the LBJ library, and most recently here in Oregon.
[03:48:34.271 --> 03:48:38.834]  And both times I've seen this guy riding around in his motorcade, which I couldn't get anywhere near.
[03:48:38.834 --> 03:48:40.295]  I think this is the closest I've got to him.
[03:48:40.295 --> 03:48:42.116]  I was probably about maybe 20 yards away or so.
[03:48:43.897 --> 03:48:49.704]  The point I'm making is not only does he have his visible security, he has the local police, state troopers, whoever else out there.
[03:48:49.704 --> 03:48:51.266]  They have snipers on the rooftop.
[03:48:51.266 --> 03:48:53.168]  They had a sniper flying around in a helicopter.
[03:48:53.168 --> 03:48:55.051]  And they weren't hiding the fact that these guys were armed.
[03:48:55.051 --> 03:48:59.356]  They wanted you to see them out there because they understand that a visual deterrent
[03:48:59.776 --> 03:49:15.127]  Such as a sniper keeps people on their best behavior, not just for Obama's safety, but while we're out there Leanne, there are no rapes, robberies, carjackings, muggings, anything of that sort in view of the sniper because people understood the visual deterrent of somebody with a firearm.
[03:49:15.127 --> 03:49:15.308]  Right.
[03:49:15.948 --> 03:49:26.511]  Absolutely, and you'll see the mainstream media has kind of been saying, oh these random stabbings in Jerusalem, oh they don't point out that these are terror attacks and they're not random.
[03:49:26.511 --> 03:49:30.752]  When you have 17 stabbings in a week and a half, that is not random.
[03:49:30.752 --> 03:49:39.775]  And actually the Jerusalem mayor is calling on civilians to carry their firearms if they have the ability to carry their guns in the wake of these terror attacks.
[03:49:39.775 --> 03:49:43.776]  So here they see there's an issue, they want people to arm, protect themselves,
[03:49:44.096 --> 03:49:51.205]  But here in our country, we're being told by our quote, leadership, that we only need to worry about the weather, not about anything.
[03:50:00.536 --> 03:50:01.616]  I'm not bashing the cops.
[03:50:01.616 --> 03:50:02.837]  The cops are reactionary.
[03:50:02.837 --> 03:50:06.557]  They get the call, then they have to get in the car, then they have to go assess the threat.
[03:50:06.557 --> 03:50:07.778]  Oh, one officer's not enough.
[03:50:07.778 --> 03:50:08.738]  Let's call the SWAT team.
[03:50:08.738 --> 03:50:10.838]  So I understand how these things work.
[03:50:10.838 --> 03:50:14.879]  But in the meantime, that's why you have a Second Amendment to protect yourself.
[03:50:14.879 --> 03:50:16.620]  And it's not just for a firearm.
[03:50:16.620 --> 03:50:22.241]  If you carry a switchblade or whatever else you have, you know, I'm a very strong proponent of people being armed.
[03:50:22.241 --> 03:50:26.622]  I'm not trying to put a handgun in every waistband in America, but if you are not
[03:50:27.302 --> 03:50:30.545]  Mentally ill, you have not committed a crime, you have not done any of these things.
[03:50:30.545 --> 03:50:37.310]  I think you should be able to arm yourself in the United States of America and tell somebody who can get there who can offer you some type of aid.
[03:50:37.310 --> 03:50:43.595]  Right, well I was just told by my brother-in-law that that's what I will be receiving for my Christmas present.
[03:50:43.595 --> 03:50:47.958]  So, I'm pretty pumped about that so you're gonna have to take me out to the range.
[03:50:47.958 --> 03:50:49.840]  Yeah, we can go do that.
[03:50:49.840 --> 03:50:55.865]  Alright, well stick around because David Knight will be joining me in studio to talk about what's coming up for the Info Wars Nightly News.

[03:54:16.249 --> 03:54:20.273]  I want to say a big thank you to all of our affiliates out there that have picked up the 4th Hour.
[03:54:20.273 --> 03:54:23.316]  I know a lot of people out there are finally getting us.
[03:54:23.316 --> 03:54:25.178]  Joining me now is David Knight.
[03:54:25.178 --> 03:54:27.540]  David, what is coming up tonight on InfoWars Nightly News?
[03:54:27.540 --> 03:54:29.362]  Sometimes Mondays are very slow.
[03:54:29.362 --> 03:54:30.624]  This one is pretty heavy.
[03:54:31.044 --> 03:54:39.131]  Well actually Leanne, there's something we haven't talked about and that is there's been a relapse in an Ebola patient who actually worked as a nurse for the last nine months.
[03:54:39.131 --> 03:54:46.337]  She was cleared of Ebola back in January and for the rest of the year she's been working as a nurse.
[03:54:46.337 --> 03:54:49.740]  She got very sick in England and so it is thrown into disarray.
[03:54:50.320 --> 03:54:59.749]  Everything they thought they knew about the Ebola virus because we've now seen that it hides out for a very long time in brains and eyes and in sexual organs.
[03:54:59.749 --> 03:55:04.973]  So that's one of the things we're going to be talking about as well as the seed vault being opened up for the people in Syria.
[03:55:04.973 --> 03:55:10.358]  And we're going to take a look at the Democrat and GOP war on the poor.
[03:55:10.358 --> 03:55:13.021]  Because when you look at this minimum wage talk and you look at what
[03:55:13.928 --> 03:55:19.029]  Bernie Sanders is offering, with one hand, he gives a wage increase to the poor.
[03:55:19.029 --> 03:55:20.970]  With the other hand, he takes it away.
[03:55:20.970 --> 03:55:25.171]  And another example of this, of course, is going to be the rise in the Obamacare penalty.
[03:55:25.171 --> 03:55:28.311]  And we're going to talk about how totally regressive that is.
[03:55:28.311 --> 03:55:31.272]  And of course, that's a label that the progressives love to use.
[03:55:31.272 --> 03:55:32.753]  They don't like to call themselves socialists.
[03:55:32.753 --> 03:55:34.313]  They like to call themselves progressives.
[03:55:34.773 --> 03:55:39.815]  And say that anything that hits the poor disproportionately is regressive, a regressive tax.
[03:55:39.815 --> 03:55:44.538]  And of course, Social Security is one of the best examples of that, one of their most beloved programs.
[03:55:44.538 --> 03:55:51.461]  And so now Obamacare is falling into the same situation, a much, much higher tax on the poorest people.
[03:55:51.461 --> 03:56:00.946]  And of course, we know they're also hardest hit because they're the ones who are most likely going to lose their jobs when there's a small business or a corporation doesn't want to pay for their health care mandates.
[03:56:01.966 --> 03:56:06.127]  Put them down on lower working hours.
[03:56:06.127 --> 03:56:10.188]  And of course, they're importing workers as they're exporting jobs.
[03:56:10.188 --> 03:56:11.469]  That's the other part of it as well.
[03:56:11.469 --> 03:56:15.590]  Yeah, not to mention everyone that's here fighting for this increase in the minimum wage.
[03:56:15.590 --> 03:56:19.611]  These are a lot of jobs that are going to be easily replaced with automation.
[03:56:19.611 --> 03:56:25.173]  So, of course, not talking about how they're going to fill that gap and what they're going to do with the many
[03:56:26.089 --> 03:56:38.454]  People here in the United States that already are suffering in this economy, but now with the flood of the illegal immigrants that we're also being told we also have to pay for as well or we're racist.
[03:56:38.454 --> 03:56:45.076]  Well, you know, when you look at what Bernie Sanders is selling people, it reminds me of that song that we use a lot as a bumper from Tennessee Ernie Ford.
[03:56:45.076 --> 03:56:47.197]  I sold my soul to the company store load 16 times.
[03:56:47.197 --> 03:56:48.938]  What do you get another day older and deeper in debt?
[03:56:49.298 --> 03:56:52.420]  That's based on what the mining companies used to do to their workers.
[03:56:52.420 --> 03:56:54.501]  They'd say, look, we're going to pay you really high wages.
[03:56:54.501 --> 03:56:59.523]  But then you would get there, and you would have to buy your food from them at a very high price.
[03:56:59.523 --> 03:57:02.405]  You'd have to buy your lodging from them at a very high price.
[03:57:02.405 --> 03:57:04.866]  You'd have to buy your tools from them at a very high price.
[03:57:04.866 --> 03:57:09.869]  And that's precisely the game that the Democrats, Socialists, and the GOP is a part of it as well.
[03:57:10.389 --> 03:57:15.114]  On the corporate crony capitalism side, they're all working that same angle.
[03:57:15.114 --> 03:57:19.999]  And unfortunately, it's the people who are poor at the bottom who are the ones who are getting ripped off the most.
[03:57:19.999 --> 03:57:27.326]  And of course, they're buying into this idea that they're going to get high wages, they're going to get freebies from the government, and it just isn't working out that way.
[03:57:27.326 --> 03:57:30.089]  There's another article that you mentioned briefly and Alex talked about.
[03:57:30.973 --> 03:57:32.614]  America is a bomb waiting to explode.
[03:57:32.614 --> 03:57:35.735]  Well, really, that bomb is open borders.
[03:57:35.735 --> 03:57:38.396]  And that is really where I think this is coming.
[03:57:38.396 --> 03:57:40.797]  That's one of the aspects of global governance.
[03:57:40.797 --> 03:57:41.978]  And we've got a speaker race.
[03:57:41.978 --> 03:57:44.019]  This is another thing we're going to talk about on the nightly news tonight.
[03:57:44.019 --> 03:57:46.520]  Of course, the House is coming back.
[03:57:46.520 --> 03:57:49.781]  It looks like they're going to bring up the speaker race again.
[03:57:49.781 --> 03:57:56.364]  And they're offering Paul Ryan, who has been one of the biggest proponents of open borders anywhere.
[03:57:56.364 --> 03:58:00.286]  And they're offering him now as speaker for Boehner's replacement.
[03:58:00.686 --> 03:58:25.286]  Wow, I guess this is all sorts of things going on and you pointed out earlier that that's of course why they don't want people to be aware of their history because that way it can then repeat itself and people every year can vote for that populist person who's telling them all the things that they want to hear and then of course afterward, after it's all signed, sealed and delivered, we see the truth, the reality of it all.
[03:58:25.586 --> 03:58:27.630]  Yeah, you're gonna get that raise from Bernie Sanders.
[03:58:27.630 --> 03:58:28.833]  Yeah!
[03:58:28.833 --> 03:58:29.815]  USA!
[03:58:29.815 --> 03:58:33.503]  Well that'll be the Info Wars Nightly News coming up tonight 7 p.m.
[03:58:33.503 --> 03:58:34.645]  Central with David Knight.
