[00:00:03.715 --> 00:00:04.816]  Thursday!
[00:00:04.816 --> 00:00:06.117]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.117 --> 00:00:07.878]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:07.878 --> 00:00:09.640]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:11.221]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.221 --> 00:00:12.762]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.762 --> 00:00:16.965]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:16.965 --> 00:00:21.028]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:25.589 --> 00:00:27.290]  Welcome ladies and gentlemen, welcome.
[00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:39.575]  Thank you for joining us for another groundbreaking, trailblazing, tip of the spear, global transmission, fearlessly, in the face of the technotronic, technocracy takeover.
[00:00:39.575 --> 00:00:41.296]  The TTT that we're facing.
[00:00:42.742 --> 00:01:02.462]  Charlie Skelton, London Guardian reporter, who was basically escorted by the police down off the mountain miles away from Milderberg yesterday, will be joining us to give us his take on the situation as the criminal confab prepares to get underway at noon our time.
[00:01:03.894 --> 00:01:05.334]  Already basically going.
[00:01:05.334 --> 00:01:07.195]  They begin arriving at noon.
[00:01:07.195 --> 00:01:09.155]  It kicks off at about six or seven at night.
[00:01:09.155 --> 00:01:12.476]  That's what time it is right now, seven hours ahead in Austria.
[00:01:12.476 --> 00:01:14.477]  So it's ongoing right now.
[00:01:14.477 --> 00:01:20.698]  We'll learn all the developments of the last 21 hours since we were live here with our reporters.
[00:01:20.698 --> 00:01:23.039]  There's the front page London Guardian.
[00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:25.600]  At the G7, we journalists were pampered.
[00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.860]  At Bilderberg, we're harassed by police.
[00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:29.761]  So that's coming up.
[00:01:29.761 --> 00:01:30.501]  Larry Klayman.
[00:01:31.653 --> 00:01:40.939]  Founder of Judicial Watch, heads up Freedom Watch USA has a cornucopia of breaking intel that he's going to be joining us.
[00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:42.480]  We know that two members of the U.S.
[00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:47.564]  Supreme Court are being targeted by spies, and it's all part of a larger blackmail operation.
[00:01:47.564 --> 00:01:55.990]  This is over-the-top important information with Larry Klainman, a true trailblazer, joining us in the third hour.
[00:01:57.233 --> 00:02:00.515]  Charlie Skelton for 30 minutes, Larry Klaman for a full hour.
[00:02:00.515 --> 00:02:02.537]  We're working on getting Mark Dice right now.
[00:02:02.537 --> 00:02:04.298]  We were working on getting him on tomorrow.
[00:02:04.298 --> 00:02:07.920]  Well, we have him for tomorrow, but I want to move him to today.
[00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:08.701]  We're just so busy.
[00:02:08.701 --> 00:02:12.263]  We haven't done a story on this, but RT picked it up.
[00:02:12.263 --> 00:02:14.885]  He went out, talked to Californians, Obama voters.
[00:02:14.885 --> 00:02:16.406]  I mean, they're the dumbest people on earth.
[00:02:16.406 --> 00:02:17.346]  I'm sorry.
[00:02:17.346 --> 00:02:23.551]  Conservatives have their problems and can be horrible police state pushers, but they do know how to wipe their butts.
[00:02:23.551 --> 00:02:26.432]  And I hate to use that analogy, but man, it's the only one that fits.
[00:02:27.313 --> 00:02:33.341]  You go talk to random Californians, they are the stupidest, most fascistic people I've ever seen.
[00:02:33.341 --> 00:02:39.089]  And Californians will tell you those aren't Californians, they're idiots that have moved in there looking to get rich quick or whatever.
[00:02:39.089 --> 00:02:43.656]  But Obama zombies, Americans sign prankster petition to nuke Russia.
[00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.712]  And, but I mean, he'll say, we need to put gun owners in forced labor camps.
[00:02:49.712 --> 00:02:52.713]  And the liberals will go, absolutely, I'm sick of them, let's enslave them.
[00:02:52.713 --> 00:02:53.973]  They are ready, folks.
[00:02:53.973 --> 00:03:00.136]  If they arrest me tomorrow and put me in a forced labor camp, the average Democrat will hail it.
[00:03:00.136 --> 00:03:02.397]  Now, is that liberal?
[00:03:02.397 --> 00:03:04.918]  No, these are sick freaks.
[00:03:04.918 --> 00:03:10.880]  I told you I've gone out to abortion clinics and every time people run up and say, I love Satan, I want to kill babies.
[00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:14.122]  So I said, we're going to go out to an abortion clinic and see what happens.
[00:03:14.122 --> 00:03:14.882]  They show up.
[00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:20.472]  And I don't care where you're at, that these demons come out from under rocks.
[00:03:20.472 --> 00:03:22.914]  It's the modus operandi.
[00:03:22.914 --> 00:03:24.895]  It's criminology.
[00:03:24.895 --> 00:03:26.856]  It's psychology.
[00:03:26.856 --> 00:03:36.861]  The more insane, the more demented, the more demonic a soul is, the more predictable.
[00:03:36.861 --> 00:03:41.283]  And we just have to come to grips with how sick these people are.
[00:03:41.283 --> 00:03:42.764]  Now, real liberals are great people.
[00:03:43.564 --> 00:03:44.686]  These folks are not it.
[00:03:44.686 --> 00:03:48.534]  But regardless, I'm playing the clip here.
[00:03:48.534 --> 00:03:54.867]  And Mark's really good at this because he just dryly walks over and goes, turn all the guns in and burn Jews in ovens for Obama.
[00:03:56.184 --> 00:04:02.208]  Open the borders and bring in world government and then have the Communist Manifesto be taught for Obama.
[00:04:02.208 --> 00:04:04.169]  Throw children to wood chippers for Obama.
[00:04:04.169 --> 00:04:05.750]  I mean, he could go that far.
[00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:12.415]  You say for Obama, they go into mind control, peer pressure mind control, and begin signing.
[00:04:12.415 --> 00:04:17.838]  So regardless, let's just get the whole RT article posted at InfoWars.com and send Drudge a link to it.
[00:04:17.838 --> 00:04:21.541]  He'll probably just link to the, if he does, to the RT one.
[00:04:22.651 --> 00:04:26.733]  It is just over the top to see this stuff.
[00:04:26.733 --> 00:04:31.535]  Speaking of Drudge, one of our top stories on Bilderberg, when we return, it's up on DrudgeReport.com.
[00:04:31.535 --> 00:04:34.536]  We're going to move it back to the front page of Infowars.com.
[00:04:34.536 --> 00:04:35.937]  It broke last night.
[00:04:35.937 --> 00:04:39.319]  Bilderberg deploys high-tech jamming to shut down communications.
[00:04:39.319 --> 00:04:42.140]  Now, as soon as I saw the video of it, I knew what it was.
[00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:47.122]  Yes, it can jam, but that's not really what it is.
[00:04:47.122 --> 00:04:51.284]  It is a giant stingray system on steroids.
[00:04:52.719 --> 00:04:55.059]  And major departments all over the world have these.
[00:04:55.059 --> 00:04:58.760]  And we're going to break it down when we come back.
[00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:10.843]  He aligns himself with the truth.
[00:05:10.843 --> 00:05:13.823]  And it's time for you to choose a side.
[00:05:13.823 --> 00:05:17.944]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:05:17.944 --> 00:05:21.885]  Bad luck wind been blowing at my back.
[00:05:25.843 --> 00:05:34.030]  I was born to bring trouble to wherever I'm at.
[00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:42.217]  Got the number 13 tattooed on my neck.
[00:05:42.217 --> 00:05:46.921]  When the ink starts to itch, then the black will turn to red.
[00:05:50.673 --> 00:05:56.356]  I was born in the soul of misery.
[00:05:56.356 --> 00:06:00.358]  Never had me a name.
[00:06:00.358 --> 00:06:05.700]  They just gave me the number when I was young.
[00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:11.142]  That's Johnny Cash bringing us in, 13.
[00:06:11.142 --> 00:06:15.604]  Got a long line of heartache, I carry it well.
[00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:26.671]  We're live Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:06:26.671 --> 00:06:27.192]  to 2 p.m.
[00:06:27.192 --> 00:06:28.733]  Central.
[00:06:28.733 --> 00:06:35.617]  We return weeknight 7 o'clock Central with InfoWars Nightly News and Sundays 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:06:35.617 --> 00:06:37.278]  Central as well.
[00:06:37.278 --> 00:06:39.339]  Huge broadcast lined up today.
[00:06:39.339 --> 00:06:44.742]  We have Charlie Skelton, London Guardian reporter, who's been heavily harassed by police.
[00:06:44.742 --> 00:06:46.583]  This is basically the worst he's ever seen.
[00:06:46.583 --> 00:06:47.484]  He's riding in the Guardian.
[00:06:49.244 --> 00:06:52.686]  At G7, we journalists were pampered at Bilderberg.
[00:06:52.686 --> 00:06:55.027]  We were harassed by police, is the headline.
[00:06:55.027 --> 00:07:00.209]  He first started covering Bilderberg, I guess, about ten years ago, nine years ago.
[00:07:00.209 --> 00:07:02.190]  And at first, he was making jokes about it.
[00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:05.852]  And then when he got there, he quit making jokes real quick.
[00:07:05.852 --> 00:07:08.433]  And it totally politically changed his outlook.
[00:07:08.433 --> 00:07:10.975]  And now he's a serious journalist.
[00:07:10.975 --> 00:07:15.797]  He was a humor columnist for The Guardian.
[00:07:15.797 --> 00:07:17.598]  And then now he doesn't think things are funny.
[00:07:19.542 --> 00:07:25.604]  After he's been arrested and harassed and spied on and everything else that he's gone through.
[00:07:25.604 --> 00:07:29.645]  You see, one cannot be told about the Matrix.
[00:07:29.645 --> 00:07:32.146]  One has to see it for themselves.
[00:07:32.146 --> 00:07:35.367]  You take the red pill, you stay in Wonderland.
[00:07:35.367 --> 00:07:38.027]  I'll show you how deep the hole goes.
[00:07:38.027 --> 00:07:45.030]  You take the blue pill, you go back to Fantasyland.
[00:07:45.030 --> 00:07:46.150]  All I'm offering is the truth.
[00:07:52.130 --> 00:07:54.492]  And we see everything interconnected.
[00:07:54.492 --> 00:07:55.873]  Look at these headlines.
[00:07:55.873 --> 00:07:57.495]  Breitbart.
[00:07:57.495 --> 00:07:59.356]  And there's video of it.
[00:07:59.356 --> 00:08:06.383]  Paul Ryan's Pelosi-esque Obama trade moment.
[00:08:06.383 --> 00:08:07.924]  And here's the quote.
[00:08:07.924 --> 00:08:10.226]  Talk about Orwellian.
[00:08:10.226 --> 00:08:14.370]  It's declassified and made public once it's agreed to.
[00:08:16.994 --> 00:08:23.035]  And then he goes on, they have the quotes where he was saying it's not secret, but now he's saying it's secret.
[00:08:23.035 --> 00:08:36.058]  That's like Senator Rubio getting up on the Senate floor and saying that there's no spying period in America without warrants.
[00:08:36.058 --> 00:08:39.839]  I mean, that is an admitted lie, clapper-esque level fraud.
[00:08:40.930 --> 00:08:43.733]  When the head of the NSA got up and said, we don't spy on anybody.
[00:08:43.733 --> 00:08:44.414]  What is that?
[00:08:44.414 --> 00:08:45.535]  I've never heard of it.
[00:08:45.535 --> 00:08:47.937]  And then his lawyer came out and goes, he forgot.
[00:08:47.937 --> 00:08:57.127]  Yeah, he just heads the NSA building giant city size, small town size complexes.
[00:08:57.127 --> 00:09:00.430]  Each building hundreds of thousands of square feet, some cases 15 buildings.
[00:09:02.176 --> 00:09:05.923]  Spying on everything on record, all the whistleblowers, all the documents.
[00:09:05.923 --> 00:09:06.845]  And he goes, what?
[00:09:06.845 --> 00:09:07.607]  Spying?
[00:09:07.607 --> 00:09:10.532]  What a... I know nothing!
[00:09:10.532 --> 00:09:11.634]  Nothing!
[00:09:11.634 --> 00:09:12.716]  It's ridiculous!
[00:09:15.199 --> 00:09:22.160]  But WikiLeaks has doled out another little goblet of part of a subsection.
[00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:24.461]  They have all 28 subsections.
[00:09:24.461 --> 00:09:25.701]  They said it was 33.
[00:09:25.701 --> 00:09:26.781]  Now it's 28.
[00:09:26.781 --> 00:09:29.462]  Now they released two full sections and part of another.
[00:09:29.462 --> 00:09:36.263]  And surprise, surprise, it makes Obamacare worse.
[00:09:36.263 --> 00:09:40.624]  And it restricts all sorts of transactions.
[00:09:40.624 --> 00:09:41.844]  It's just horrible.
[00:09:41.844 --> 00:09:42.564]  Wow.
[00:09:42.564 --> 00:09:44.805]  And it's got climate taxes in it.
[00:09:46.792 --> 00:09:47.792]  Of course it does.
[00:09:47.792 --> 00:09:53.455]  I mean, we know what's in the EU, we know what's in the NAU, we know the agenda, it's always the same.
[00:09:53.455 --> 00:09:59.897]  And they won't let us see it, like three times under Bush, the so-called immigration reform, but Senator Sessions would leak it each time.
[00:09:59.897 --> 00:10:06.380]  And then when we finally got Obama's new proposal, it was the exact same piece of legislation that they said was secret.
[00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:11.662]  Because they don't want you to see it because it's wildly unpopular, wildly unconstitutional.
[00:10:13.732 --> 00:10:33.279]  The only thing more wild is the 8% approval rating government in Gallup polls that continues to do this while amassing paramilitary force to try to illegitimately dominate a population that they have basically usurped.
[00:10:33.279 --> 00:10:34.180]  Here's another story.
[00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:37.641]  Revealed the secret immigration chapter in Obama's trade agreement.
[00:10:40.029 --> 00:11:04.743]  Discovered inside a huge tranche of secretive Obama trade documents released by WikiLeaks and key details on how technically a Republican voting for trade promotion authority, TPA, that would fast-track trade deals like the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, would technically also be voting to massively expand President Obama's executive authority when it comes to immigration matters.
[00:11:04.743 --> 00:11:06.224]  And it goes through the document.
[00:11:06.224 --> 00:11:08.465]  Of course, globalism gets rid of borders.
[00:11:10.023 --> 00:11:25.154]  Everything we've seen out of TPP is a regurgitation of what we saw in 2007 when Judicial Watch, the founder of which is joining us today, Larry Klayman, sued and got 3,000 plus pages of the meeting.
[00:11:25.154 --> 00:11:31.979]  And let me tell you, I read, I scanned over most of it.
[00:11:31.979 --> 00:11:33.680]  I read hundreds of pages of the stinking thing.
[00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:35.642]  That's why I quote it constantly, because I actually read it.
[00:11:37.304 --> 00:11:41.025]  Usually I just go to key subsections that other people have already read and go right to the points.
[00:11:41.025 --> 00:11:43.706]  I mean, there's just tens of thousands of pages of this stuff a week to read.
[00:11:43.706 --> 00:11:44.767]  I can't read it all.
[00:11:44.767 --> 00:11:48.468]  But I spent time, as I was making the endgame, reading that.
[00:11:48.468 --> 00:11:52.009]  And talk about a skeleton key to open every door on this.
[00:11:52.009 --> 00:11:54.350]  It's how they run the whole show.
[00:11:54.350 --> 00:11:58.391]  The corporations come in, the Fortune 100, they vote in a Congress.
[00:11:58.391 --> 00:12:06.694]  Then the secretaries of states of the countries that are there actually just basically certify the whole thing.
[00:12:08.578 --> 00:12:27.584]  Take the orders, admit they're taking orders, and then vote, and then that vote, certifying what they just said, is seen as basically treaty law, outside of law, and then it's implemented by bureaucracies and agencies, even if it doesn't pass Congress.
[00:12:27.584 --> 00:12:36.227]  And that's their excuse whenever they ignore Congress, they go, we've already done deals with NATO, we've already done deals with the UN, we've already done this, we're going ahead with it, even if you don't ratify it.
[00:12:37.222 --> 00:12:49.144]  And Congress just wants to be able to not get the political heat, so they won't vote for carbon taxes, or shutting down power plants, or opening borders, or putting our military under NATO, or arming Al Qaeda.
[00:12:49.144 --> 00:12:52.765]  But they'll just kind of turn their head and watch it happen.
[00:12:52.765 --> 00:12:59.507]  But now they're transferring to the President incredible centralized control.
[00:12:59.507 --> 00:13:00.047]  Here it is.
[00:13:00.047 --> 00:13:05.888]  WikiLeaks releases more of Obama trade draft, altering health care,
[00:13:07.136 --> 00:13:08.677]  Halting Medicare reform.
[00:13:08.677 --> 00:13:12.258]  Congress wouldn't be able to reform Medicare.
[00:13:12.258 --> 00:13:14.139]  It ends our country's sovereignty.
[00:13:14.139 --> 00:13:17.941]  It's one of the final world government documents.
[00:13:17.941 --> 00:13:25.264]  And Paul Ryan says you can't see it.
[00:13:25.264 --> 00:13:31.067]  Now we got Rupert Murdoch preparing to step down as CEO from 21st Century Fox.
[00:13:31.067 --> 00:13:32.587]  Putting his son in, that's a big move.
[00:13:32.587 --> 00:13:34.428]  We've got huge Bilderberg news.
[00:13:34.428 --> 00:13:35.609]  Our reporter's joining us.
[00:13:37.662 --> 00:13:42.824]  A bunch of special reports that are very important.
[00:13:42.824 --> 00:13:44.744]  New stingray systems that are even worse.
[00:13:44.744 --> 00:13:46.645]  And that's why I want to air this now.
[00:13:46.645 --> 00:13:52.147]  The minute I saw this report get filed last night, they were told by a, quote, informed local.
[00:13:52.147 --> 00:13:54.187]  They don't want to say by who.
[00:13:54.187 --> 00:13:57.808]  It was from someone who'd been inside the hotel, high level.
[00:13:57.808 --> 00:13:59.409]  We're just going to leave it at that.
[00:13:59.409 --> 00:14:03.390]  There are always people that do care about freedom and whose conscience pushes them.
[00:14:03.390 --> 00:14:04.390]  I'm going to skip this network break.
[00:14:04.390 --> 00:14:05.591]  This is so important.
[00:14:05.591 --> 00:14:06.191]  Only break I'm skipping.
[00:14:08.442 --> 00:14:10.264]  So stations shouldn't leave us here in three minutes.
[00:14:10.264 --> 00:14:15.711]  This is a network break coming up.
[00:14:15.711 --> 00:14:20.337]  The minute I saw the truck, because I talked to Paul about it when I got the video yesterday,
[00:14:22.332 --> 00:14:24.113]  And it was near dark that they got up there.
[00:14:24.113 --> 00:14:30.215]  And we're the only journalist so far to find a back road to get up and get actual video of the hotel.
[00:14:30.215 --> 00:14:31.555]  Notice all we have is photos.
[00:14:31.555 --> 00:14:32.895]  No one else has gotten video.
[00:14:32.895 --> 00:14:35.056]  Talk about something out of a science fiction movie.
[00:14:35.056 --> 00:14:37.197]  It looks like something from Giddy Prime.
[00:14:37.197 --> 00:14:45.219]  There's this big step pyramid, uh, Aztec style building.
[00:14:45.219 --> 00:14:49.381]  I expect they'll shoot Dust Till Dawn 2 there.
[00:14:49.381 --> 00:14:49.521]  And
[00:14:52.386 --> 00:14:59.831]  The locals are really upset, and they go, no, we've been told directly by the federal police that this is the jammed communications.
[00:14:59.831 --> 00:15:01.973]  Well, I looked at the truck.
[00:15:01.973 --> 00:15:07.616]  We're going to show it here in a moment and play the video of your radio listener, Infowars.com forward slash show.
[00:15:07.616 --> 00:15:11.499]  We have the free video feed or DrugsReport.com or Infowars.com.
[00:15:11.499 --> 00:15:14.581]  Both have the article from Infowars posted.
[00:15:14.581 --> 00:15:17.843]  You can go see the video in HD right there.
[00:15:17.843 --> 00:15:19.525]  But the minute I saw it, I said, guys,
[00:15:20.731 --> 00:15:23.452]  That doubles as basically a giant stingray.
[00:15:23.452 --> 00:15:24.513]  All the different arrays.
[00:15:24.513 --> 00:15:27.594]  Only one of the arrays is a jammer.
[00:15:27.594 --> 00:15:38.438]  Because I've talked to engineers in the past, I've been shown by folks, secret surveillance trucks that Dallas and Houston and Austin have, that are basically like the size of a beer truck.
[00:15:38.438 --> 00:15:42.240]  And then the sides open up into a whole communications command center.
[00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:44.380]  These awnings come out.
[00:15:44.380 --> 00:15:49.663]  Well, the German system's got four masks on it, or the Austrian system, same group.
[00:15:52.478 --> 00:15:58.605]  And what it does is it basically makes everybody's cell phone data go through it first.
[00:15:58.605 --> 00:16:04.892]  And they've got two more of the trucks out there that have extended even bigger towers, but they're out past the tree lines.
[00:16:04.892 --> 00:16:10.037]  You can only see the towers, but I'll assure you those are mounted on trailers or trucks.
[00:16:10.037 --> 00:16:11.899]  Three of them we can see.
[00:16:11.899 --> 00:16:14.202]  One truck, but two masked that have been extended.
[00:16:15.629 --> 00:16:29.339]  And so it's their own internal communication system because the federal government of Austria is putting this on, but it also grabs all the surrounding towns cell phone data and runs it through and spies on it for keyword right there at the site.
[00:16:29.339 --> 00:16:34.783]  So it's a giant stingray system to illegally harvest folks data.
[00:16:34.783 --> 00:16:37.906]  That's what those trucks do when they have a warrant.
[00:16:39.141 --> 00:16:48.843]  They go out and then follow the mafia around or whatever, or Russian smugglers or whatever, that's what Austrians deal with a lot, and then can track everything that's happening.
[00:16:48.843 --> 00:16:56.805]  No matter how many phones, you know, the criminal group is using, they've got a warrant to target that whole spectrum and to hone in on who it is.
[00:16:56.805 --> 00:17:00.386]  That's, though, how they've expanded this out so wide now that it includes everybody.
[00:17:01.601 --> 00:17:12.768]  So this is a big international story that NSA-style systems are being deployed to defend against the press and coverage of the secretive group.
[00:17:12.768 --> 00:17:20.653]  Just like TPP's secret, this is secret because it's the very same group and they can't operate if their agenda continues to be in secret.
[00:17:21.033 --> 00:17:26.734]  I know I'm stating the obvious to our old listeners, but for new listeners, that's why Bilderberg is so important.
[00:17:26.734 --> 00:17:35.797]  First they said it didn't exist for decades, then they said it doesn't have any power, now they admit it has power, and they're trying to keep the public back miles away.
[00:17:35.797 --> 00:17:40.638]  But our reporters, who we're going to be talking to in about 10 minutes, 12 minutes to be precise,
[00:17:41.807 --> 00:18:01.383]  We're able to get up to an area on the perimeter where they've put up a fence where they say you get two weeks in jail, 500 pound, 500 euro, excuse me, teleprompter free folks, so I go off memory, euro fine.
[00:18:01.383 --> 00:18:04.045]  So great job to the crew getting this.
[00:18:04.045 --> 00:18:04.866]  So beautiful.
[00:18:04.866 --> 00:18:09.770]  I wish I was there looking at the HD video of the mist blowing over the pines.
[00:18:11.314 --> 00:18:17.819]  And the fir trees and this bizarre pyramid building looks like an alien spacecraft that's landed or something.
[00:18:17.819 --> 00:18:20.321]  And it just looks like a science fiction movie.
[00:18:20.321 --> 00:18:24.745]  And they're up there and it's just so gorgeous with the Alps in the background.
[00:18:24.745 --> 00:18:30.789]  And then there's surveillance, imperial probe droid, snorkels stuck up everywhere, jamming.
[00:18:30.789 --> 00:18:34.713]  Because we talked to the locals, their cell phones, when you get right up to the perimeter, don't work.
[00:18:35.563 --> 00:18:38.804]  We can't live stream from there, that's jammed.
[00:18:38.804 --> 00:18:46.247]  And when you start stepping, because they've got it tuned, to where as you start getting near the perimeter, cell phones stop working.
[00:18:46.247 --> 00:18:52.009]  And people that go to the hotel, I'll just leave it at that, without giving away sources.
[00:18:52.009 --> 00:18:56.070]  Bilderberg's probably really mad right now.
[00:18:56.070 --> 00:18:57.451]  Hey, not everybody's cowards, okay?
[00:18:57.451 --> 00:18:58.971]  Not everybody's going to roll over to your takeover.
[00:19:02.388 --> 00:19:03.629]  We know they are jamming.
[00:19:03.629 --> 00:19:04.589]  So the report's accurate.
[00:19:04.589 --> 00:19:07.330]  They are jamming.
[00:19:07.330 --> 00:19:11.051]  But the bigger issue is they're scooping all the data up.
[00:19:11.051 --> 00:19:19.874]  So let's go ahead and go to this report with our crew, Josh Owens, Rob Due, and Paul Joseph Watson in Austria, Bilderberg 2015.
[00:19:22.236 --> 00:19:24.098]  Rob Dew here reporting for InfoWars.com.
[00:19:24.098 --> 00:19:25.960]  We have some breaking news.
[00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:28.703]  First off, just over this way, we're going to show you some shots of this.
[00:19:28.703 --> 00:19:31.306]  We have a sighting of the Hotel Interalpen.
[00:19:31.306 --> 00:19:36.892]  We were able to see the site and it's along the road going to the golf course.
[00:19:36.892 --> 00:19:38.574]  But that's not the big breaking news.
[00:19:38.574 --> 00:19:40.857]  The big breaking news is actually standing behind me.
[00:19:40.857 --> 00:19:42.258]  What it looks like we have here is a
[00:19:43.079 --> 00:19:48.161]  A communications type van, but not to enable communications, to disable communications.
[00:19:48.161 --> 00:19:52.163]  And here with more on that is Paul Joseph Watson, who just landed from Innsbruck today.
[00:19:52.163 --> 00:19:53.423]  Paul, how are your communications?
[00:19:53.423 --> 00:19:59.606]  Yeah, we were just talking to an informed local who told us a few other interesting things, but he directly said that this vehicle
[00:20:00.266 --> 00:20:07.688]  ...is basically designed to cut off communications for anybody in the nearby area trying to cover Bilderberg as media.
[00:20:07.688 --> 00:20:16.729]  So this could be a transmitter, we're not sure, but we were told directly that this van is being used to cut cell phone signals so people can't broadcast and cover this event.
[00:20:16.729 --> 00:20:21.410]  So it's not enough that they have checkpoints six miles around the perimeter.
[00:20:21.410 --> 00:20:28.772]  Now we can't even cover the event via, you know, standard cell phone coverage because they're directly interfering in people's communications.
[00:20:28.772 --> 00:20:29.512]  It's ridiculous.
[00:20:29.972 --> 00:20:40.999]  And I'll tell you this, Paul, the Wi-Fi, we're supposed to have Wi-Fi at the place I'm staying at up on the mountain, and I haven't been able to get anything out of there, only cell phone signals are the only thing that comes out, so I'm wondering if this has to do with that.
[00:20:40.999 --> 00:20:46.002]  There's also an antenna right over there, we'll shoot another long-range shot of that so we can show you what that looks like.
[00:20:46.002 --> 00:20:52.726]  It looks like it was pretty recent put up, but that could also be part of this triangulation grid that they're setting up to cut off communications.
[00:20:53.166 --> 00:20:58.870]  Yeah, there was speculation during the Bundy Ranch siege that this was happening, that they were cutting off communications.
[00:20:58.870 --> 00:21:00.251]  That was never confirmed.
[00:21:00.251 --> 00:21:05.574]  We were told directly by a very informed local who said that this is exactly what's happening.
[00:21:05.574 --> 00:21:16.401]  So if they have to go to this level to shut down independent media and mainstream press coverage of this event, again, it illustrates how paranoid they are about any information leaking out of Bilderberg 2015.
[00:21:17.802 --> 00:21:26.850]  And you know I wouldn't be surprised if after we put out this report that suddenly this area becomes off-limits because right now we are free to travel in this area.
[00:21:26.850 --> 00:21:29.352]  You can actually see the barrier over here.
[00:21:29.352 --> 00:21:41.762]  You're not allowed to go over that way and there's a barrier on the other side of the road over there and those are basically if you step over that line or if you are caught on the other side of that line it is a 500 euro fine or two weeks in jail whichever you prefer.
[00:21:42.921 --> 00:21:46.103]  Yeah, and it's obviously quite near the golf course, which is still open.
[00:21:46.103 --> 00:21:47.504]  That's outside the perimeter.
[00:21:47.504 --> 00:21:51.026]  But people could just wander into that security zone on a whim.
[00:21:51.026 --> 00:21:56.450]  You could get families out hiking on the weekend, not aware of what's going on with Bilderberg, and they could just wander in and be subject to a €500 fine.
[00:21:56.450 --> 00:21:57.430]  Again, it's insane.
[00:21:58.951 --> 00:22:02.033]  Or if you knock your golf ball over into the finery and that's your last one.
[00:22:02.033 --> 00:22:04.994]  Hey, I could get my golf ball and boom, 500 euro fine.
[00:22:04.994 --> 00:22:06.255]  Anything could happen.
[00:22:06.255 --> 00:22:06.775]  And guess what?
[00:22:06.775 --> 00:22:08.396]  Bilderberg is starting tomorrow.
[00:22:08.396 --> 00:22:10.697]  The elites will start landing at Innsbruck.
[00:22:10.697 --> 00:22:13.618]  They'll be taken here either by car.
[00:22:13.618 --> 00:22:15.139]  Some might come by helicopter.
[00:22:15.139 --> 00:22:16.660]  Who knows how they're going to be getting here.
[00:22:16.660 --> 00:22:18.881]  Henry Kissinger, I think, is coming by teleportation device.
[00:22:20.336 --> 00:22:22.358]  Well, I wouldn't put anything past him.
[00:22:22.358 --> 00:22:28.304]  But I mean, this is a big story that, you know, we've been told that this van is there to cut out communications.
[00:22:28.304 --> 00:22:29.905]  There's nobody in it at the moment.
[00:22:29.905 --> 00:22:32.087]  I'm sure there has been at some point.
[00:22:32.087 --> 00:22:33.789]  So this is a major breaking story.
[00:22:33.789 --> 00:22:39.375]  Bilderberg directly interfering in communications to prevent coverage of their conference.
[00:22:39.375 --> 00:22:42.037]  Yeah, they're stifling all forms of communication.
[00:22:42.037 --> 00:22:44.459]  But what would you expect in the home of Adolf Hitler?
[00:22:45.340 --> 00:22:46.300]  I don't know.
[00:22:46.300 --> 00:22:49.221]  This is Rob Deere reporting for InfoWars.com with Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:22:49.221 --> 00:22:55.322]  Here's a shot, once again, if anybody out there knows what this is, please tell us in the comments of this video if we're wrong.
[00:22:55.322 --> 00:23:02.704]  We've been told that this is a device, a communications device, to cut off communication to the outside world, exactly what the elites want.
[00:23:02.704 --> 00:23:04.424]  They want to stay in shadows.
[00:23:04.424 --> 00:23:07.945]  They don't want to step out in the light and just say, hey, we're here to control you.
[00:23:07.945 --> 00:23:08.345]  We're here to
[00:23:09.145 --> 00:23:10.026]  Control all your money.
[00:23:10.026 --> 00:23:13.088]  We want to get rid of cash so we can control everything about your life.
[00:23:13.088 --> 00:23:14.909]  They want to keep that hidden from you out there.
[00:23:14.909 --> 00:23:17.090]  And that's why we need to see people out there speaking up.
[00:23:17.090 --> 00:23:22.054]  We thank everybody for calling the police and letting them know that they cannot stifle journalists here.
[00:23:22.054 --> 00:23:24.135]  That really helped us out, so we really do appreciate it.
[00:23:24.135 --> 00:23:27.417]  Once again, this is Rob Dyrdek reporting for Infowars.com and Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:23:27.417 --> 00:23:30.659]  Thank you.
[00:23:30.659 --> 00:23:35.883]  And we'll be talking to all those guys coming up here in about six, seven minutes after we got a break.
[00:23:37.276 --> 00:23:45.347]  But if you watch the video at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, you'll notice two other towers off in the distance.
[00:23:45.347 --> 00:23:46.890]  You can see the booms that they're...
[00:23:49.107 --> 00:23:54.471]  Telescopically hoisted on, and those are trucks or trailers that are out there guaranteed.
[00:23:54.471 --> 00:23:58.534]  We just can't see because the trees are blocking.
[00:23:58.534 --> 00:24:00.875]  And those are Stingray systems.
[00:24:00.875 --> 00:24:08.761]  May not be from the company Stingray, but popularly known, that's one of the most highly purchased by law enforcement units.
[00:24:08.761 --> 00:24:12.544]  Even some small towns, I was reading a few weeks ago, have purchased.
[00:24:12.544 --> 00:24:15.346]  One town in California purchased 50 of them.
[00:24:17.062 --> 00:24:19.403]  Another town in California, 40 of them.
[00:24:19.403 --> 00:24:21.483]  And they're expensive.
[00:24:21.483 --> 00:24:32.707]  So now they're just going to have tons of police units without warrants, driving around, grabbing everybody's cell phone data and just listening to it.
[00:24:32.707 --> 00:24:35.088]  It's illegal for a PI to have it.
[00:24:35.088 --> 00:24:37.428]  It's illegal for a citizen to have it, and I can see why.
[00:24:37.428 --> 00:24:41.930]  Of course, criminals, these have obviously fallen into the hands of criminals and hackers as well.
[00:24:44.417 --> 00:25:00.547]  And I get there's a bad criminal element out there, and sure, I bet you can really catch a lot of criminals and stuff like this, but the government then becomes corrupt having this and ends up framing people, ends up consolidating power every time things like this get turned against the people and the government itself.
[00:25:00.547 --> 00:25:04.490]  Look at how Congress is getting spied on by the CIA and the NSA.
[00:25:04.490 --> 00:25:06.331]  That's all come out.
[00:25:06.331 --> 00:25:08.412]  The British Parliament's being spied on.
[00:25:08.412 --> 00:25:10.734]  The German Reichstag, the Bundestag,
[00:25:11.641 --> 00:25:12.582]  Is being spied on.
[00:25:12.582 --> 00:25:13.542]  It's come out.
[00:25:13.542 --> 00:25:21.227]  The bureaucracy and the private interest that get their people in control of it, that a corporate takeover of government.
[00:25:21.227 --> 00:25:22.367]  And it's mafia.
[00:25:22.367 --> 00:25:24.228]  It's not free market.
[00:25:24.228 --> 00:25:26.950]  And they want to meet in secret.
[00:25:26.950 --> 00:25:30.032]  It is a huge victory, though, that we're forcing it out in the open.
[00:25:30.032 --> 00:25:33.534]  I cannot reiterate that enough, that we're forcing TPP out.
[00:25:34.534 --> 00:25:37.096]  That we're forcing Bilderberg out.
[00:25:37.096 --> 00:25:39.337]  That we're forcing these same players out.
[00:25:39.337 --> 00:25:42.980]  I mean, it's Henry Kissinger and David Rockefeller at the bottom of all of this.
[00:25:42.980 --> 00:25:51.285]  Because they were handed the reins of power in the 50s by the retiring and dying Rockefellers and Rothschilds of that time.
[00:25:51.285 --> 00:25:54.747]  That's why everybody grovels to Kissinger and grovels to David Rockefeller.
[00:25:54.747 --> 00:26:04.214]  If you look up the 30-plus organizations founded to push the UN, if you look at the organizations founded for the North American Union, every one of them was founded by the Carnegie's and Rockefellers.
[00:26:04.814 --> 00:26:14.825]  And David Rockefeller, you could go to C-SPAN speeches he's given 25 years ago, 8 years ago, where he gets up there and talks about global government and all the organizations he's founded.
[00:26:16.573 --> 00:26:21.574]  I'm just a simple banker, but I'm proud to have founded this organization.
[00:26:21.574 --> 00:26:36.778]  And then you go, look, he's founded them all, his family gave him the land the UN's on, so all these billionaires grovel to him because almost the whole world, the system, was chosen and designed by Henry Kissinger and David Rockefeller.
[00:26:37.438 --> 00:26:43.246]  For almost 60 years, they've been running the Anglo-American Power Group.
[00:26:43.246 --> 00:26:45.349]  I mean, they're mega-powerful.
[00:26:45.349 --> 00:26:47.031]  They're like Emperor Palpatine, folks.
[00:27:00.512 --> 00:27:03.157]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:27:03.157 --> 00:27:08.406]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:27:21.824 --> 00:27:27.728]  They just gave me a number when I was young.
[00:27:27.728 --> 00:27:33.131]  They have microchip identification devices implanted into their body.
[00:27:33.131 --> 00:27:41.197]  Got a long line of heartache, I carry it well.
[00:27:41.197 --> 00:27:45.459]  The list of lives I've broken reach from here to hell.
[00:27:49.687 --> 00:27:53.509]  Bad luck wind been blowin' at my back
[00:27:57.388 --> 00:27:59.690]  I pray you don't look at me.
[00:27:59.690 --> 00:28:02.432]  I pray I don't look back.
[00:28:02.432 --> 00:28:03.532]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:28:03.532 --> 00:28:05.134]  I am your host Alex Jones.
[00:28:05.134 --> 00:28:09.336]  I was born in the soul of misery.
[00:28:09.336 --> 00:28:11.658]  Coming up, two very important reports.
[00:28:11.658 --> 00:28:17.002]  The delusions of King Barack Obama by John Bowne and laser beams.
[00:28:17.002 --> 00:28:20.084]  Boeing's weapons get sci-fi sound effects.
[00:28:20.084 --> 00:28:22.346]  Leon McAdoo looks deeply into that.
[00:28:23.186 --> 00:28:26.429]  We have another police officer shot in the back.
[00:28:26.429 --> 00:28:29.551]  Randomly, probably part of the war on local police.
[00:28:29.551 --> 00:28:31.292]  Soros is financing.
[00:28:31.292 --> 00:28:32.573]  That's out of the Houston Chronicle.
[00:28:32.573 --> 00:28:35.435]  We're going to be looking at that attempt.
[00:28:35.435 --> 00:28:38.057]  The officer is not dead, but is in the hospital.
[00:28:38.057 --> 00:28:39.899]  That's at least good news.
[00:28:39.899 --> 00:28:43.561]  Because they want to kill a bunch of cops and get the cops all militarized, folks.
[00:28:43.561 --> 00:28:46.344]  That's the plan.
[00:28:46.344 --> 00:28:48.505]  People out there cheering stuff like this are idiots.
[00:28:48.505 --> 00:28:50.667]  Once a civil war starts, it's not going to be a joke.
[00:28:52.668 --> 00:28:57.016]  Scientists in a major report say lack of good gut bacteria could be giving you cancer.
[00:28:57.016 --> 00:28:57.718]  We're going to look at that.
[00:29:00.094 --> 00:29:05.258]  We're going to look at Rupert Murdoch preparing to step down as CEO of 21st Century Fox.
[00:29:05.258 --> 00:29:06.919]  Egyptian police arrest U.S.
[00:29:06.919 --> 00:29:09.201]  embassy worker on terror charges.
[00:29:09.201 --> 00:29:15.266]  Yeah, the Obama administration is running al-Qaeda and the Muslim Brotherhood inside of Egypt.
[00:29:15.266 --> 00:29:16.907]  That's come out in an Egyptian court.
[00:29:16.907 --> 00:29:18.549]  We already knew that.
[00:29:18.549 --> 00:29:27.956]  But it's really crazy that our government would be funding the enemies of our allies to put horrible people in charge to destroy
[00:29:29.025 --> 00:29:33.708]  One of the most populous countries, well the most populous country in the Middle East.
[00:29:33.708 --> 00:29:38.791]  You talk about a powder keg situation, this is dangerous.
[00:29:38.791 --> 00:29:51.760]  Coming up, Paul Ryan Pelosi-esque moment, says it's declassified, speaking of TPP, says it's declassified and made public, then they will release it to the public.
[00:29:54.727 --> 00:29:55.408]  So there you go.
[00:29:55.408 --> 00:29:58.473]  It's declassified and made public when it's agreed to.
[00:29:58.473 --> 00:30:00.856]  So you can read it after we pass it.
[00:30:00.856 --> 00:30:10.571]  And we know what it gives Obama, dictatorial power over everything, and that's now coming out as WikiLeaks releases another piece of the puzzle.
[00:30:11.889 --> 00:30:18.490]  Now again, joining us from Austria is Paul Joseph Watson, Rob Dew, and Josh Owens.
[00:30:18.490 --> 00:30:25.892]  Major new developments since we talked to them 21 hours ago here on the Wednesday edition Bilderberg 2015.
[00:30:25.892 --> 00:30:33.773]  The very top, the paramount area of global power structure.
[00:30:33.773 --> 00:30:37.274]  The 150 members, they say it's 130, there's usually 15, 20 extra secret attendees.
[00:30:41.158 --> 00:30:56.959]  Sit on top of all the major corporate boards, government boards, military boards, and then have their minions under them carrying out money laundering, snuff films, weapons contracts, illegal deals, arms sales to dictators.
[00:30:56.959 --> 00:30:58.161]  I mean, you name it, they're involved.
[00:30:58.837 --> 00:31:08.086]  Just pick anybody, they're involved at the top of Bilderberg and they're just involved in every nastiness, whether it's Hillary Clinton or Henry Kissinger or David Rockefeller, it only gets worse.
[00:31:08.086 --> 00:31:18.537]  And again, these are the people that went to the scientific technological elite that Eisenhower warned of in 61 and his farewell address as Kennedy was coming in.
[00:31:21.084 --> 00:31:23.947]  And decided to go with this eugenics plant.
[00:31:23.947 --> 00:31:38.959]  The computers, the checkpoints, the cell phones, the control grids, they've all... Brzezinski in 1976 wrote a book breaking it all down, The Technotronic Era.
[00:31:38.959 --> 00:31:43.563]  I remember being like nine years old and my dad said, when you get old enough son, you need to read this.
[00:31:44.502 --> 00:31:46.004]  And I was like, what's the book about?
[00:31:46.004 --> 00:31:50.169]  He goes, well, the government brings in the drugs so they can control organized crime.
[00:31:50.169 --> 00:31:54.334]  And the government launders the money and they're going to put in computers that control everything and track everyone.
[00:31:54.334 --> 00:31:57.738]  It's going to be just like Brave New World.
[00:31:57.738 --> 00:32:02.563]  And then later, when I was about, I don't know, 11 or 12, I read the Brzezinski book.
[00:32:02.563 --> 00:32:04.566]  Didn't understand much of it, but it seemed wild.
[00:32:07.108 --> 00:32:07.588]  You understand?
[00:32:07.588 --> 00:32:13.552]  I mean, he wrote books that they put Khmer Rouge in to kill a third of the Cambodian population.
[00:32:13.552 --> 00:32:16.994]  They write books bragging about their evil.
[00:32:16.994 --> 00:32:19.395]  That's who's at this meeting.
[00:32:19.395 --> 00:32:20.876]  And they set all this up.
[00:32:20.876 --> 00:32:22.317]  I mean, they are smart.
[00:32:22.317 --> 00:32:23.358]  They are powerful.
[00:32:23.358 --> 00:32:28.341]  There's a reason people worth $100 billion go to Bilderberg and grovel to them.
[00:32:28.341 --> 00:32:31.263]  Bill Gates has gone all of them.
[00:32:31.263 --> 00:32:34.284]  Because these guys built our world.
[00:32:34.284 --> 00:32:36.646]  I mean, they're the ones that are turning our world into a nightmare.
[00:32:38.066 --> 00:32:40.327]  That's why they're important.
[00:32:40.327 --> 00:32:41.367]  Every major U.N.
[00:32:41.367 --> 00:32:44.509]  property given to them by these people.
[00:32:44.509 --> 00:32:50.271]  All the corporate boards set up by these people since at least the late 50s.
[00:32:50.271 --> 00:33:01.856]  David Rockefeller, Zbigniew Brzezinski, and Henry Kissinger, along with George Soltz and a few others, have run the entire country, and thus the Western world.
[00:33:04.804 --> 00:33:06.746]  And they have set it all up.
[00:33:06.746 --> 00:33:08.647]  And they don't want you to know about it.
[00:33:08.647 --> 00:33:15.772]  They don't want you to discuss it as they prepare to merge the three global unions into one super state under ten sub-regions.
[00:33:15.772 --> 00:33:16.533]  Where did I read that?
[00:33:16.533 --> 00:33:23.298]  I remember being in Sunday school and they talked about the ten regions, the ten kings.
[00:33:23.298 --> 00:33:32.064]  I just... Either it's all true and happening in prophecy or the globalists are following it as a blueprint.
[00:33:32.064 --> 00:33:32.965]  Either way, it's real.
[00:33:34.056 --> 00:33:39.000]  Just like you could say was science fiction written a hundred years ago by Jules Verne's.
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:41.062]  Was he psychic or was he just a good guesser?
[00:33:41.062 --> 00:33:41.783]  Doesn't matter.
[00:33:41.783 --> 00:33:46.687]  What we envision ends up then manifesting.
[00:33:46.687 --> 00:33:55.035]  Given enough time, we take you now live to Austria in the Alps outside of Telz.
[00:33:55.035 --> 00:33:59.498]  Paul Joseph Watson, give us your current location and what's happened in the last 21 hours.
[00:34:02.639 --> 00:34:05.603]  Yeah, we're currently back at the hotel, Alex, uploading some videos.
[00:34:05.603 --> 00:34:11.190]  We've actually, um, got an interview with Charlie Skinner.
[00:34:11.190 --> 00:34:13.013]  There was also a big story last night.
[00:34:13.013 --> 00:34:18.580]  He was basically raided at midnight by the cops in his hotel for the reason of...
[00:34:19.548 --> 00:34:22.550]  Simply going to retrieve something from his car.
[00:34:22.550 --> 00:34:24.411]  They searched his vehicle again.
[00:34:24.411 --> 00:34:26.012]  They had flashlights out in his face.
[00:34:26.012 --> 00:34:27.493]  They entered his hotel.
[00:34:27.493 --> 00:34:28.473]  Again, checked his papers.
[00:34:28.473 --> 00:34:29.234]  So there's a headline.
[00:34:29.234 --> 00:34:32.035]  London Guardian reporter raided a hotel room.
[00:34:32.035 --> 00:34:32.896]  Get it up right now.
[00:34:32.896 --> 00:34:34.157]  Bombshell information.
[00:34:34.157 --> 00:34:38.199]  The video's already up, so the article's gonna be up as soon as I get off the air here, but...
[00:34:38.945 --> 00:34:49.295]  Yeah, again, they've been generally more friendly towards us, but we think that's obviously because, you know, Rob and Josh got in their faces with the camera.
[00:34:49.295 --> 00:34:52.397]  And we had people all over the world call them.
[00:34:52.397 --> 00:34:53.699]  Yeah, you put all the numbers up.
[00:34:53.699 --> 00:35:00.165]  So, they've generally been friendlier towards us, but there was a protester arrested earlier today.
[00:35:00.165 --> 00:35:02.947]  They had an armored personnel carrier.
[00:35:02.947 --> 00:35:04.829]  And again, just think how pathetic this is.
[00:35:10.643 --> 00:35:12.324]  Yeah, we've lost his Skype.
[00:35:12.324 --> 00:35:15.906]  Right at the end.
[00:35:15.906 --> 00:35:16.766]  Stop for a moment, Paul.
[00:35:16.766 --> 00:35:18.307]  We're going to try to reconnect with you.
[00:35:18.307 --> 00:35:20.288]  Or should you guys go back up to the roof?
[00:35:20.288 --> 00:35:22.869]  Because I know we're interviewing Skelton in 20 minutes.
[00:35:22.869 --> 00:35:25.211]  Perhaps, is Skelton with you?
[00:35:25.211 --> 00:35:27.912]  No, Skelton's in a different hotel.
[00:35:27.912 --> 00:35:29.333]  So is he joining us by phone, guys?
[00:35:32.170 --> 00:35:35.373]  Let's try to get you now to be able to start over.
[00:35:35.373 --> 00:35:37.055]  Maybe your Skype's stabilized.
[00:35:37.055 --> 00:35:40.458]  Go back to the beginning, and I'm going to try to shut up and let you report.
[00:35:40.458 --> 00:35:44.062]  Charlie Skelton raided at his hotel.
[00:35:44.062 --> 00:35:45.744]  London Guardian reporter raided.
[00:35:45.744 --> 00:35:47.906]  Nighttime raid.
[00:35:47.906 --> 00:35:50.909]  Bilderberg police raid Guardian reporter.
[00:35:50.909 --> 00:35:53.151]  I mean, this is just insane at his hotel.
[00:35:53.151 --> 00:35:55.233]  And then go back over what's happened.
[00:35:59.830 --> 00:36:01.971]  Yeah, it was basically midnight to 1am.
[00:36:01.971 --> 00:36:04.552]  He went out to retrieve something from his vehicle.
[00:36:04.552 --> 00:36:13.917]  The police immediately descended upon him, entered his lodge, um, started questioning all the people who were in there, demanded their papers, again searched the vehicle.
[00:36:13.917 --> 00:36:18.339]  They had flashlights out, you know, shining them in their face.
[00:36:18.339 --> 00:36:22.761]  No, from what Skelton said, they were basically there for at least 20 minutes, maybe half an hour.
[00:36:22.761 --> 00:36:27.183]  He actually jumped in the shower because they were there so long.
[00:36:29.418 --> 00:36:33.140]  So, we just got the video up on that today shortly after I get off the air.
[00:36:33.140 --> 00:36:34.940]  So again, another example of the harassment.
[00:36:34.940 --> 00:36:49.386]  And then after that I was saying they had an armoured personnel carrier driving up the road towards the Interalpen Hotel to deal with what was literally less than ten bloggers and journalists at the entrance to the hotel.
[00:36:49.386 --> 00:36:53.668]  There were about three protesters at the checkpoint at the bottom of the hill.
[00:36:54.372 --> 00:37:02.976]  From what I saw from the images, because we were as close to the hotel as we could get, because they give us that permission because we're staying in the lodge nearby.
[00:37:02.976 --> 00:37:09.499]  But at the bottom checkpoint, the first checkpoint, I saw no more than three or four protesters.
[00:37:09.499 --> 00:37:10.740]  One of those was arrested.
[00:37:10.740 --> 00:37:20.884]  So again, that's testament to the fact they've got 2,000 police out here to deal with probably a total of two dozen journalists, bloggers and protesters.
[00:37:20.884 --> 00:37:21.224]  2,000 police.
[00:37:24.073 --> 00:37:28.316]  Well, you know what Proverbs says, the wicked flee when none pursue.
[00:37:28.316 --> 00:37:33.619]  That's Proverbs 28.1.
[00:37:33.619 --> 00:37:35.581]  Obviously, the police aren't idiots.
[00:37:35.581 --> 00:37:38.523]  Obviously, the Bilderberg Group are not idiots.
[00:37:38.523 --> 00:37:41.325]  Why are they doing this when it villainizes them?
[00:37:41.325 --> 00:37:44.367]  Is it just because they're so disconnected and so arrogant they don't care, Paul?
[00:37:46.112 --> 00:37:48.994]  I don't know whether they're acting on direct orders from Bilderberg.
[00:37:48.994 --> 00:37:53.736]  They obviously were in relation to what was going on right at the entrance to the hotel.
[00:37:53.736 --> 00:38:04.241]  Because there was a security screw-up, not the first one, when one of the Bilderberg members arrived in a car and they couldn't confirm his papers or whatever.
[00:38:04.241 --> 00:38:06.602]  So he was literally sat there in the car.
[00:38:06.602 --> 00:38:08.423]  We were like two yards away.
[00:38:08.423 --> 00:38:11.065]  He was sat there for about 10-15 minutes.
[00:38:11.065 --> 00:38:13.446]  Then another Bilderberg member arrived behind him.
[00:38:13.906 --> 00:38:14.227]  I don't know.
[00:38:36.149 --> 00:38:43.283]  We did get as close as physically possible at the only entrance to the hotel right as they were driving in.
[00:38:43.283 --> 00:38:46.769]  We were literally two yards away from all the cars and all those photos are on Twitter.
[00:38:47.612 --> 00:39:01.756]  And we're showing some of those Twitter tweet photos right now at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com and directly from real Alex Jones on Twitter and also your Twitter account, Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:39:01.756 --> 00:39:02.936]  But that was my next question.
[00:39:02.936 --> 00:39:04.516]  You just got to it.
[00:39:04.516 --> 00:39:06.297]  A lot of them have started to arrive.
[00:39:06.297 --> 00:39:11.978]  We see photos of the bright green armored personnel carrier.
[00:39:11.978 --> 00:39:13.178]  That is a military type.
[00:39:13.178 --> 00:39:15.199]  That is a heavy armored vehicle.
[00:39:16.323 --> 00:39:17.444]  Simply insane.
[00:39:17.444 --> 00:39:26.367]  I see Charlie Skelton out there surrounded by, you know, the police vans and the police watching and the armored vehicle.
[00:39:26.367 --> 00:39:27.808]  Just simply ridiculous.
[00:39:29.475 --> 00:39:33.539]  No, there were busloads of police going up and down all day.
[00:39:33.539 --> 00:39:38.463]  They were just sending more and more buses of police when literally nobody had turned up.
[00:39:38.463 --> 00:39:46.310]  I mean, to compare it to Switzerland, there were at least, you know, 50 to 75 protesters who weren't just bloggers and journalists.
[00:39:46.830 --> 00:39:50.192]  Now, right next to the hotel, it was a smattering.
[00:39:50.192 --> 00:39:54.194]  There were a few people from Italy, a few Americans there, and us.
[00:39:54.194 --> 00:39:55.675]  And that was basically it.
[00:39:55.675 --> 00:40:01.758]  It was less than 10 people at the peak time when all the Bilderberg members were arriving.
[00:40:01.758 --> 00:40:04.399]  And Rob Dew was also able to hike up
[00:40:04.999 --> 00:40:10.000]  Into the mountains and get some really good shots directly onto the Bilderberg Hotel.
[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:12.421]  Really clear shots of the balconies.
[00:40:12.421 --> 00:40:17.522]  Well, you couldn't get the Bilderberg men but you did get the female police and that you get a gold star for.
[00:40:17.522 --> 00:40:25.704]  There are a lot of female police around and in fact the one that they encountered in the police station was at the checkpoint today at the bottom.
[00:40:25.704 --> 00:40:26.424]  We saw her again.
[00:40:27.807 --> 00:40:29.488]  Oh my goodness.
[00:40:29.488 --> 00:40:34.332]  Looks like the Swedish Kikini team in dark blue uniforms.
[00:40:34.332 --> 00:40:35.553]  It's not bad on the eyes.
[00:40:35.553 --> 00:40:38.676]  Anyways, excuse me folks, I am a man.
[00:40:38.676 --> 00:40:40.718]  Expanding on all this though, Paul.
[00:40:43.417 --> 00:40:50.563]  The police didn't get hysterical in England, they didn't get hysterical in the US, they didn't get hysterical in Turkey, they didn't get hysterical anywhere.
[00:40:50.563 --> 00:40:53.725]  They did a little bit in Greece, but what is up with the Austrians?
[00:40:53.725 --> 00:40:58.068]  I mean, they're really following the Germanic stereotype of flipping out.
[00:40:58.068 --> 00:41:00.730]  Talking to Estill and others, he said Germany's even worse.
[00:41:02.172 --> 00:41:08.762]  It's just the hysteria of like 10 reporters and hundreds of police and armored vehicles.
[00:41:08.762 --> 00:41:10.024]  It's a joke.
[00:41:10.024 --> 00:41:15.552]  It'd be like armored vehicles showing up at a park where families are having picnics or something.
[00:41:15.552 --> 00:41:17.055]  I mean, what is the issue here?
[00:41:18.914 --> 00:41:22.795]  I mean, they must realise how ridiculous it is seeing it today.
[00:41:22.795 --> 00:41:28.356]  And the other point is, again, there are no mainstream journalists there whatsoever.
[00:41:28.356 --> 00:41:40.338]  There was one RT cameraman who was staying in the same hotel as us, who we talked to, and he compared it, he was talking about Botswana and all these other places where he'd been, you know, thrown in jail for filming.
[00:41:40.338 --> 00:41:42.739]  He said it was somewhat approaching that.
[00:41:42.739 --> 00:41:43.099]  But again,
[00:41:45.485 --> 00:41:55.275]  Alright, we've got to have him pause.
[00:41:55.275 --> 00:41:56.256]  Fade him down for a moment.
[00:41:56.256 --> 00:41:58.118]  He's going to have to reset.
[00:41:58.118 --> 00:42:03.904]  We're going to come back in the next break, finish up with him, then talk to the other reporters, then get Charlie Skelton on.
[00:42:03.904 --> 00:42:07.007]  But really important information coming across from Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:42:07.968 --> 00:42:17.630]  I think we should go ahead and call Rob Dew on a cell phone so when we come back he can be on video but with the cell phone audio or give Watson Dew's cell phone or vice versa.
[00:42:17.630 --> 00:42:18.590]  Let's do that.
[00:42:18.590 --> 00:42:29.832]  We're going to go to break and come back here in a moment and get some more of this intel but looking at the Twitter photos that we're going to put into an article for InfoWars.com of the armored vehicle.
[00:42:29.832 --> 00:42:37.274]  Armored vehicle joins Stingray snooping towers and jammers at Bilderberg.
[00:42:38.721 --> 00:42:54.169]  But the big headline is London Guardian accredited reporter covering Bilderberg for nine years, no criminal record, media critic as well, well known, has TV shows in the UK, a part of TV shows.
[00:42:54.169 --> 00:42:58.991]  I mean the cops know who everybody is, they have dossiers, they know that Skelton's harmless.
[00:42:58.991 --> 00:43:05.835]  And they raided him last night at his hotel and came into it at 1am.
[00:43:05.835 --> 00:43:08.036]  This is pure intimidation and is shameful.
[00:43:09.400 --> 00:43:12.722]  But, again, what do you expect in Botswana?
[00:43:12.722 --> 00:43:14.603]  Or Somalia?
[00:43:14.603 --> 00:43:16.724]  Or Austria?
[00:43:16.724 --> 00:43:23.988]  And it is this love of authoritarianism that gave the world Adolf Hitler.
[00:43:23.988 --> 00:43:25.829]  And hot blonde police women.
[00:43:25.829 --> 00:43:30.391]  But, excuse me, I'm just joking around, folks.
[00:43:30.391 --> 00:43:31.532]  This is just ridiculous.
[00:43:34.734 --> 00:43:37.355]  I just want to believe in people.
[00:43:37.355 --> 00:43:39.676]  I want to think of the good in people.
[00:43:39.676 --> 00:43:43.677]  But man, government is just out of control and they're run by a bunch of crooks.
[00:43:43.677 --> 00:43:45.578]  But we do have the first video of the hotel.
[00:43:45.578 --> 00:43:48.199]  They've kept people back so far, our guys got it finally.
[00:43:49.491 --> 00:43:53.594]  That's up on Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[00:43:53.594 --> 00:43:56.396]  Paul Watson, he probably doesn't have more to add.
[00:43:56.396 --> 00:44:00.079]  Let's just get due in here because I want to go ahead and get the Charlie Skelton article up first.
[00:44:00.079 --> 00:44:02.341]  I want to break that right now with Paul Watson's video.
[00:44:02.341 --> 00:44:05.183]  Now I have a stinging suspicion this is going to go viral.
[00:44:05.183 --> 00:44:06.244]  Where is the press though?
[00:44:06.244 --> 00:44:12.129]  Will you stand up for each other and free speech worldwide or will you all aid the globalists in destroying freedom?
[00:44:13.240 --> 00:44:17.643]  Now before I go any further, briefly, I told you we were running out of Survival Shield X2.
[00:44:17.643 --> 00:44:19.224]  We ran out for a couple days.
[00:44:19.224 --> 00:44:21.766]  We had a limited amount that got finished.
[00:44:21.766 --> 00:44:25.069]  It is a very small amount compared to what we had last time.
[00:44:25.069 --> 00:44:30.072]  And the group is working on then getting more of the Deep Earth Crystals and manufacturing more.
[00:44:30.072 --> 00:44:31.333]  But that could take months.
[00:44:31.333 --> 00:44:34.695]  So if you want to get Survival Shield Nascent Iodine X2, you've heard the right reviews.
[00:44:34.695 --> 00:44:36.577]  A lot of folks have deficiencies.
[00:44:36.577 --> 00:44:41.380]  If you're going to talk to your physician and take iodine, I would suggest this because it's so pure.
[00:44:41.380 --> 00:44:41.941]  It's what I take.
[00:44:42.561 --> 00:44:44.581]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:44:44.581 --> 00:44:54.784]  It helps fund the operation You Can't Lose.
[00:44:54.784 --> 00:44:56.164]  Bilderberg 2015.
[00:44:56.164 --> 00:45:02.805]  You'll never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy.
[00:45:02.805 --> 00:45:04.826]  We must be cautious in Austria.
[00:45:14.019 --> 00:45:21.143]  And we are back live talking to Rob Dew, Paul Watson, and Josh Owens from their hotel outside Bilderberg 2015.
[00:45:21.143 --> 00:45:35.531]  What the elite don't want you to see, they don't want you aware of this, they want you to know all about Jenner, and all about Kardashian, and all about LeBron James, and all the stuff that doesn't matter.
[00:45:37.383 --> 00:45:45.286]  We're in an epic battle against a scientific takeover that has decided to reduce world population by at least 90%.
[00:45:45.286 --> 00:45:48.387]  Publicly, they say 80.
[00:45:48.387 --> 00:45:49.187]  And you know what?
[00:45:49.187 --> 00:46:00.752]  You can look at their arguments and see how we're hurting the Earth and seeing lazy people in overpopulated Western countries, in some areas that are overpopulated, and argue, yeah, we should reduce human population.
[00:46:02.176 --> 00:46:05.197]  But they're doing it through soft kill in the food and water.
[00:46:05.197 --> 00:46:08.538]  They're even targeting smart, hard-working people.
[00:46:08.538 --> 00:46:10.479]  You can't do that and not become evil.
[00:46:10.479 --> 00:46:17.041]  And it turns out they're the worst people for the earth with GMO, genetic engineering, with all of it.
[00:46:17.041 --> 00:46:19.342]  So they're not even doing what they say they're doing.
[00:46:21.254 --> 00:46:26.356]  They're using that excuse to be totally Machiavellian and kill whoever they want.
[00:46:26.356 --> 00:46:28.516]  And I'm not endorsing eugenics.
[00:46:28.516 --> 00:46:30.957]  I'm saying I see their perspective.
[00:46:30.957 --> 00:46:32.417]  I understand their perspective.
[00:46:32.417 --> 00:46:34.358]  I don't agree with it.
[00:46:34.358 --> 00:46:37.639]  But they don't even follow what they claim they're doing it for.
[00:46:37.639 --> 00:46:41.000]  They really just like to hurt people.
[00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:43.681]  And humans will be weak and decadent by themselves.
[00:46:43.681 --> 00:46:47.402]  When it's encouraged and the skids are greased, we're in trouble.
[00:46:48.590 --> 00:46:52.596]  Again, it's very expensive for us to send our crew to Austria.
[00:46:52.596 --> 00:46:55.360]  We're able to do it because you do support InfoWars.com.
[00:46:55.360 --> 00:47:00.668]  We're running a 20% off special on ProPure G2 water pitchers, the best deal we've ever offered.
[00:47:01.861 --> 00:47:07.465]  We also are offering again the Survival Shield X2 Nacin Iodine is back in.
[00:47:07.465 --> 00:47:11.688]  Hopefully not for a limited time, but it looks like it'll be this last little run for a while.
[00:47:11.688 --> 00:47:14.750]  That truck is coming in to the Fulfillment Center today.
[00:47:14.750 --> 00:47:17.632]  In fact, it's arriving any minute from the laboratory.
[00:47:17.632 --> 00:47:20.434]  So, InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:47:20.434 --> 00:47:22.115]  When it's sold out, it's sold out.
[00:47:22.115 --> 00:47:27.118]  Books, videos, t-shirts, it's all available there at the InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:47:28.460 --> 00:47:32.376]  Shopping Center, and that's how we fund this operation, so thank you all for your support.
[00:47:34.360 --> 00:47:41.602]  But if you want your Survival Show Nation I9X2, and you want to stockpile it, or hold some back, or share it with friends and family, now's the time to act.
[00:47:41.602 --> 00:47:45.142]  We're also about to sell out of Prostagard, it'll take a month or two to refill.
[00:47:45.142 --> 00:47:48.343]  And we're also about to sell out of oil of oregano, or organic type.
[00:47:48.343 --> 00:47:54.804]  Alright, shifting gears, only a few minutes in this segment, Rob Dew, give us your take on what you've seen in the last 21 hours.
[00:47:54.804 --> 00:48:01.566]  Things have escalated, armored vehicles, 1am raids of London Guardian Reporter, this is getting crazy.
[00:48:03.160 --> 00:48:04.301]  Yeah, it definitely is.
[00:48:04.301 --> 00:48:08.544]  And right now, actually, outside our window, I've got Josh on standby with a camera.
[00:48:08.544 --> 00:48:11.807]  Um, we saw, I saw two helicopters zip by real quickly.
[00:48:11.807 --> 00:48:13.228]  There's a big rainstorm coming in.
[00:48:13.228 --> 00:48:15.290]  We can see lightning over the mountains right now.
[00:48:15.290 --> 00:48:17.772]  Um, and then another helicopter followed.
[00:48:17.772 --> 00:48:18.953]  I got the third helicopter.
[00:48:18.953 --> 00:48:23.877]  So there's a lot of helicopter activity right now outside, which is in contrast to what we saw.
[00:48:23.877 --> 00:48:25.978]  We didn't see any helicopter activity all day.
[00:48:25.978 --> 00:48:29.621]  Well, they deliver a lot of people by helicopter.
[00:48:29.621 --> 00:48:31.483]  Sure, they deliver a lot of the scum by helicopter.
[00:48:33.001 --> 00:48:33.882]  Totally.
[00:48:33.882 --> 00:48:41.230]  And so, today, when we were at the entrance, I was talking to a German who spoke really good English, and he said, you know, earlier today, I was up on the mountain.
[00:48:41.230 --> 00:48:42.671]  I saw a great vantage point.
[00:48:42.671 --> 00:48:43.832]  I said, let's go.
[00:48:43.832 --> 00:48:48.938]  You know, we already had the other guys there getting video, and we hiked up this mountain trail.
[00:48:49.778 --> 00:48:55.140]  Beautiful hike and we get about halfway up the mountain and there's just this amazing shot of the hotel.
[00:48:55.140 --> 00:48:57.982]  So I've tweeted those out, sent them to the guys.
[00:48:57.982 --> 00:49:00.983]  Hopefully they've, I think they're turning them into backgrounds for you right now as well.
[00:49:00.983 --> 00:49:04.484]  We're trying to get this stuff out there as quick as we can.
[00:49:04.484 --> 00:49:13.848]  And on top of that this morning, early this morning, we went to the golf course where the most likely the Builder Burgers will be there on Saturday from the intel we've received.
[00:49:13.848 --> 00:49:15.749]  And so we wanted to go scope out the place.
[00:49:15.749 --> 00:49:17.250]  We got probably within
[00:49:18.510 --> 00:49:23.633]  Stay there.
[00:49:23.633 --> 00:49:25.654]  I want to talk about these surveillance trucks.
[00:49:25.654 --> 00:49:26.195]  Stay there.
[00:49:26.195 --> 00:49:28.176]  There's a delay in audio, folks.
[00:49:28.176 --> 00:49:32.038]  That's why we're talking over each other.
[00:49:41.092 --> 00:49:45.915]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:49:45.915 --> 00:49:47.516]  You want answers?
[00:49:47.516 --> 00:49:49.057]  Well, so does he.
[00:49:49.057 --> 00:49:53.260]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:49:53.260 --> 00:49:57.843]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:49:57.843 --> 00:50:08.871]  If you're a radio listener, you're missing dramatic photos and video that are playing behind me of up close at the Giant Hotel, the armored limousines coming in, helicopters, you name it.
[00:50:09.812 --> 00:50:14.279]  It looks like something out of a science fiction movie, but it's real.
[00:50:16.682 --> 00:50:24.204]  These meetings shrouded in secret, merging what was left of the Nazi elite with the Anglo-American Empire at the end of World War II.
[00:50:24.204 --> 00:50:33.707]  The meetings began in 1945, but didn't officially kick off until 1954 in Oosterbeek, Holland, when the group was given the name the Bilderberg Group.
[00:50:33.707 --> 00:50:42.810]  Henry Kissinger and David Rockefeller both attended the 1954 meeting with the father of Queen Beatrice of the Netherlands, Prince Bernhard, the SS officer.
[00:50:43.490 --> 00:50:45.872]  And they're back in their home, Austria.
[00:50:45.872 --> 00:50:53.018]  Beautiful country, amazing culture, really great people, except they love black uniforms and tyranny for some reason.
[00:50:53.018 --> 00:50:53.859]  Some of them do.
[00:50:53.859 --> 00:50:56.621]  That's just kind of the flavor.
[00:50:56.621 --> 00:50:58.182]  They think Darth Vader is cool, I'm sure.
[00:50:58.182 --> 00:51:02.626]  I guess Vader is a Germanic name for father.
[00:51:02.626 --> 00:51:06.189]  But let's just continue here now with Rob Doo.
[00:51:06.189 --> 00:51:07.510]  Rob Doo, please continue.
[00:51:08.948 --> 00:51:10.470]  Okay.
[00:51:10.470 --> 00:51:14.313]  While we were there, we got some up-close shots of the other antenna arrays.
[00:51:14.313 --> 00:51:17.917]  Not the actual truck, but the other one that was up closer.
[00:51:18.719 --> 00:51:20.680]  And we also found a map.
[00:51:20.680 --> 00:51:28.204]  They had maps in the police lines strung up everywhere where the actual line is set now, where if you go over this line, you're done.
[00:51:28.204 --> 00:51:30.345]  You're getting a $500 fine, two weeks in jail.
[00:51:30.345 --> 00:51:36.067]  And then we went back and went up back to the entrance of the hotel, shot some footage there, interviewed Charlie Skelton.
[00:51:36.067 --> 00:51:39.649]  I actually just put up an interview I did with an Italian parliament representative
[00:51:40.129 --> 00:51:44.131]  His name was Apollo Barini, I think is the right way to pronounce his name.
[00:51:44.131 --> 00:51:46.112]  He was actually up there, he's concerned.
[00:51:46.112 --> 00:52:00.758]  Mario Monti is coming to this Bilderberg this year, and also Lily Gruber, a news executive and anchor, who's sort of like, she does a lot of political interviews, so of course they're inviting her up, so she could help dish out the agenda in a nice
[00:52:02.019 --> 00:52:09.545]  Well, it's also there so that other reporters can dream someday if they keep their mouth shut, too.
[00:52:09.545 --> 00:52:14.529]  They might get invited as well and get to, like, worship Henry Kissinger.
[00:52:14.529 --> 00:52:15.790]  Rub his feet or something.
[00:52:15.790 --> 00:52:16.771]  Totally disgusting.
[00:52:19.512 --> 00:52:25.458]  We have two different vantage points in which we could perform some reconnaissance tomorrow during the event.
[00:52:25.458 --> 00:52:29.181]  Hopefully we'll get some of them out on their balconies.
[00:52:29.181 --> 00:52:30.402]  I know exactly where to go.
[00:52:30.402 --> 00:52:34.206]  It's about an hour hike from the bottom, but we can get up there.
[00:52:34.206 --> 00:52:39.751]  I was told even that there is a radar station up higher up the mountain.
[00:52:39.751 --> 00:52:44.075]  There's a cabin up the mountain that this guy goes up there and he sells beer to hikers.
[00:52:44.722 --> 00:52:50.132]  And, uh, there's a radar station nearby and this guy's really pissed off about it, so... So now we know why you want to hide to the top.
[00:52:50.132 --> 00:52:50.973]  It's not a good video.
[00:52:52.466 --> 00:52:53.167]  Oh, of course.
[00:52:53.167 --> 00:52:53.487]  No.
[00:52:53.487 --> 00:52:55.768]  I mean, I can bring my own beer with me if I want to.
[00:52:55.768 --> 00:52:56.208]  I'm joking!
[00:52:56.208 --> 00:53:04.734]  Everybody's just talking about this guy that sells beer on top of the mountain, but sounds like a real hermit-type person who is pissed off about the Bilderbergers.
[00:53:04.734 --> 00:53:10.337]  So I'd like to find an old person that's pissed off, because I have yet to find an old person that's really pissed off about this.
[00:53:10.337 --> 00:53:12.879]  The only people I've found are young people that are concerned about this.
[00:53:12.879 --> 00:53:14.239]  The old people have given up.
[00:53:14.239 --> 00:53:14.940]  They've submitted.
[00:53:15.572 --> 00:53:22.218]  Okay, it's like that sculpture we shot a couple days ago of the globalist, giant globalist stepping on the peon.
[00:53:22.218 --> 00:53:25.041]  I mean, these people have just submitted and it makes me sick.
[00:53:25.041 --> 00:53:28.684]  So to find an old person that's really fed up with that, I can't wait to meet it.
[00:53:28.684 --> 00:53:30.986]  What kind of beer does he sell?
[00:53:32.245 --> 00:53:32.686]  I don't know.
[00:53:32.686 --> 00:53:33.587]  I'll find out tomorrow.
[00:53:46.770 --> 00:53:51.072]  Uh, he can get tweets out, but I mean, we're really having a hard time getting stuff out.
[00:53:51.072 --> 00:53:52.592]  We actually have to come back to our hotel.
[00:53:52.592 --> 00:53:55.834]  Well, they admittedly, they admittedly have jamming equipment.
[00:53:55.834 --> 00:54:00.175]  I mean, that is jamming equipment, but it's also really stingray to grab all the cell phone data.
[00:54:00.175 --> 00:54:01.856]  Sounds like they're jamming you right now, Alex.
[00:54:01.856 --> 00:54:04.417]  I didn't make that out.
[00:54:04.417 --> 00:54:07.018]  I was just saying that that's also a stingray type system.
[00:54:07.018 --> 00:54:07.658]  Here's what I'm gonna do.
[00:54:07.658 --> 00:54:09.039]  I'm gonna get Charlie Skelton on.
[00:54:10.764 --> 00:54:30.961]  If at the bottom of the hour, Paul Watson, you or Josh want to add more, please come back, but I want you to coordinate with the writers and folks right now, with Steve Watson, Don Salazar, Kit Daniels and others, to get all your photos and videos out to the world as we engage in real journalism, because the corporate whore media won't do their job.
[00:54:30.961 --> 00:54:34.444]  Now, London Guardian is doing their job, so their guy got raided.
[00:54:36.690 --> 00:54:39.475]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:54:39.475 --> 00:54:42.280]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:53.642 --> 00:54:57.086]  Infowars.com is barely up right now.
[00:54:57.086 --> 00:54:59.449]  We're getting massive traffic.
[00:54:59.449 --> 00:55:02.092]  We normally get over a million individual visitors a day.
[00:55:02.092 --> 00:55:05.516]  We're getting a million every few hours right now.
[00:55:05.516 --> 00:55:07.759]  And the site's very interactive.
[00:55:07.759 --> 00:55:09.340]  We have free video feeds and more.
[00:55:09.921 --> 00:55:14.364]  Bilderberg deploys giant Stingray to grab all digital communications.
[00:55:14.364 --> 00:55:19.188]  Surveillance truck parked outside Bilderberg is a giant Stingray type system.
[00:55:19.188 --> 00:55:22.931]  I would just add type system on steroids.
[00:55:22.931 --> 00:55:28.155]  And you can see in the videos, we'll get some screen grabs of that as well, that
[00:55:29.434 --> 00:55:33.879]  There are other towers that have been put up from trucks or trailers.
[00:55:33.879 --> 00:55:36.101]  We just can't see because trees are in the way.
[00:55:36.101 --> 00:55:37.903]  We can see even bigger masts.
[00:55:37.903 --> 00:55:41.567]  And we talked to locals that, let's just say, have access to the hotel.
[00:55:41.567 --> 00:55:43.369]  They say none of their cell phones work.
[00:55:43.369 --> 00:55:44.109]  It is a jammer.
[00:55:45.400 --> 00:55:57.853]  So, very serious situation, violating all sorts of EU laws to have these systems, because I've seen the EU laws and the UK laws as well that are similar.
[00:55:57.853 --> 00:56:02.518]  We have laws here as well on the illegal stingrays, and when I say stingray, it's like saying taser.
[00:56:03.881 --> 00:56:11.825]  People think of all electrical devices for defense or whatever as a taser, though there's dozens of companies.
[00:56:11.825 --> 00:56:20.609]  We don't know exactly what companies, machineries involved, it's just commonly known as a stingray type device.
[00:56:21.587 --> 00:56:29.490]  Now we've had our reporters harassed at their hotel, the police have come there, they've stopped them, searched them at the checkpoints, knowing them by name.
[00:56:29.490 --> 00:56:41.315]  We then put out the State Police Department's name, and they call it State Police, it's Federal Police, but they're sub-district over that state.
[00:56:41.315 --> 00:56:49.298]  In Austria, you called, they backed off, stopped harassing them, but Charlie Skelton, award-winning journalist for the London Guardian,
[00:56:50.672 --> 00:57:14.346]  wrote this story yesterday at the G7 we journalists were pampered at Bilderberg were harassed by police and last night they got raided they came into their lodge hotel room rousted everyone this is unprecedented they know exactly who Skelton is they escorted him off the mountaintop when he first arrived two days ago
[00:57:15.540 --> 00:57:21.185]  With a police escort in front and back of his car, even though he had a reservation up the mountain.
[00:57:21.185 --> 00:57:24.508]  He got back up to his reservation.
[00:57:24.508 --> 00:57:26.029]  Again, TheGuardian.com.
[00:57:26.029 --> 00:57:32.095]  Charlie Skelton joins us to talk about this situation.
[00:57:32.095 --> 00:57:37.700]  We now have a bright green armored vehicle showing up to menace 10 journalists.
[00:57:37.700 --> 00:57:38.561]  We have just
[00:57:39.577 --> 00:57:44.360]  Squadrons of police stomping around and getting in everyone's face.
[00:57:44.360 --> 00:57:47.622]  Charlie has been detained in other countries.
[00:57:47.622 --> 00:57:51.404]  He's been stalked, harassed, like the late great Jim Tucker has been.
[00:57:51.404 --> 00:57:59.590]  They tend to really target Skelton, because The Guardian is undoubtedly the number one paper in the UK, and from talking to family that lives in Germany,
[00:58:00.680 --> 00:58:02.521]  And talking to folks that go to Europe a lot.
[00:58:02.521 --> 00:58:05.662]  I've been to Europe, but not that much.
[00:58:05.662 --> 00:58:12.185]  The Guardian is the English-speaking paper, and people all speak English in Europe, or try to, to communicate.
[00:58:12.185 --> 00:58:13.706]  And so it's kind of the international language.
[00:58:13.706 --> 00:58:16.387]  So it's the biggest paper probably in Europe itself.
[00:58:16.387 --> 00:58:21.109]  And so this is like them going after a New York Times reporter in New York City.
[00:58:21.109 --> 00:58:22.170]  It's very bold.
[00:58:22.970 --> 00:58:30.544]  It's very aggressive, it's very dangerous, because if they can go after Charlie Skelton, folks, they can go after anybody.
[00:58:32.398 --> 00:58:34.459]  And so we either hang together or hang separate.
[00:58:34.459 --> 00:58:36.781]  He's a mild-mannered fellow as well.
[00:58:36.781 --> 00:58:41.444]  He's a comedy writer, journalist, and actor from Suffolk, England.
[00:58:41.444 --> 00:58:42.764]  An Oxford University graduate.
[00:58:42.764 --> 00:58:46.807]  He started as a journalist writing features for the Evening Standard and The Guardian.
[00:58:46.807 --> 00:58:51.890]  He began reporting on the Bilderberg Group many years ago, and at first kind of thought it was a joke.
[00:58:51.890 --> 00:58:54.071]  Very soon didn't think it was.
[00:58:54.071 --> 00:58:55.552]  And so he joins us now.
[00:58:55.552 --> 00:59:00.235]  He works with his wife as well, getting out some of the hardest reporting out there.
[00:59:00.235 --> 00:59:01.716]  So thank you so much for coming on, sir.
[00:59:02.967 --> 00:59:03.267]  Thank you.
[00:59:03.267 --> 00:59:05.409]  And can I just compliment you on your amazing looking studio?
[00:59:05.409 --> 00:59:06.989]  Well, thank you.
[00:59:06.989 --> 00:59:12.393]  You know, so the Guardian coverage has gone to the front of the paper website.
[00:59:12.393 --> 00:59:13.874]  It's in the physical paper.
[00:59:13.874 --> 00:59:16.375]  This has got to really upset the Bilderberg Group.
[00:59:16.375 --> 00:59:19.077]  Tell us what happened to you and why you think they're so bold.
[00:59:21.536 --> 00:59:31.161]  Well, I think it's possibly because the juxtaposition of the G7 and Bilderberg this year has meant that the policing here is on an extremely heavy scale.
[00:59:31.161 --> 00:59:32.681]  I mean, there's a lot of it.
[00:59:32.681 --> 00:59:37.143]  It feels, to me, as heavy as it was back in 2009 in Greece.
[00:59:37.143 --> 00:59:40.185]  And, you know, it's not as bad as that.
[00:59:40.185 --> 00:59:42.826]  But there's still a big police presence.
[00:59:42.826 --> 00:59:47.989]  And, yeah, I think it has something to do with the gigantic security operation that was the G7.
[00:59:49.873 --> 00:59:54.938]  And for folks that don't know, the G7 just ended and this is basically a continuation of that.
[00:59:54.938 --> 01:00:02.245]  Yeah, it was only, it finished like a couple of days before and about 20 miles away, just across the border in Germany.
[01:00:02.245 --> 01:00:08.250]  But, you know, the experience of being a journalist in the two places could not be more extreme.
[01:00:08.250 --> 01:00:15.417]  I mean, there we were pampered and primped and helped out in every way imaginable by the government.
[01:00:16.307 --> 01:00:21.831]  And here, you know, we're impeded and hindered and harassed by the government.
[01:00:21.831 --> 01:00:24.233]  And it's very strange to have gone one from the other.
[01:00:24.233 --> 01:00:28.356]  It's like getting out of a hot bath and jumping into an ice bath.
[01:00:28.356 --> 01:00:31.038]  You know, it's quite a shock.
[01:00:31.038 --> 01:00:37.723]  Why do you think it's so different, A, and then B, I mean, I know you've got the classic British gentlemanly demeanor.
[01:00:37.723 --> 01:00:39.905]  When stuff happens to Watson, everyone wants to talk about it.
[01:00:39.905 --> 01:00:43.708]  But you got raided last night, so let's talk about what happened to you.
[01:00:46.523 --> 01:01:14.394]  I had ended up with three uh policemen in my in my hotel room and but they were checking a checking my identification now this bear in mind my identification had been checked twice at two separate police checkpoints about 15 minutes before no more than that so I was an extremely checked and identified person at this point but it wasn't good enough so uh these three policemen and they you know fluorescent bibs and their side arms decided to stand over me for
[01:01:15.667 --> 01:01:16.888]  It must have been about a quarter of an hour.
[01:01:16.888 --> 01:01:19.190]  This is at one in the morning, right, in my hotel room.
[01:01:19.190 --> 01:01:20.792]  I got so bored and I was so annoyed.
[01:01:20.792 --> 01:01:23.254]  I wanted to say something, but I didn't want to be aggressive.
[01:01:23.254 --> 01:01:28.098]  So I just took my trousers and shirt off and stripped down to my pants and said, I'm taking a shower.
[01:01:28.098 --> 01:01:33.062]  And went and got into the shower, had a shower, came out in my towel, and they were still in my room.
[01:01:34.071 --> 01:01:35.431]  Still checking me out.
[01:01:35.431 --> 01:01:37.312]  Possibly checking me out in my towel, I don't know.
[01:01:37.312 --> 01:01:42.173]  But, um, so I... They said, no, I'm sorry, Mr. Scott, you've got to put your clothes on and come to your car.
[01:01:42.173 --> 01:01:48.355]  So, I put my clothes on and the interview continued out of the car, where they searched the car.
[01:01:48.355 --> 01:01:58.538]  I don't know quite what they were expecting me to have put in the car somewhere after the... And I know full well you're writing cover stories for the biggest newspaper in Europe, and they're acting like this.
[01:01:59.369 --> 01:02:04.952]  Well, I did say to them, look, I mean, I know this is annoying for me, but at least you're giving me something to write about.
[01:02:04.952 --> 01:02:10.774]  And also, I was out there for so long that I decided to just start talking to them about Bilderberg.
[01:02:10.774 --> 01:02:17.677]  And I just said, look, I know you're treating me like a criminal right now, but there are actual criminals up in the hotel.
[01:02:17.677 --> 01:02:20.699]  You happen to be pointing the wrong way, you guys.
[01:02:20.699 --> 01:02:25.321]  There are convicted felons up in the Bilderberg.
[01:02:25.321 --> 01:02:27.942]  Kissinger, Petraeus, the list goes on and on.
[01:02:29.144 --> 01:02:35.386]  Yeah, and there's an Austrian guy as well who's just been handed out a... René Benko.
[01:02:35.386 --> 01:02:40.887]  He's just been handed out a one-year suspended sentence for bribery, you know.
[01:02:40.887 --> 01:02:44.268]  So, they knew him and so they were aware of that.
[01:02:44.268 --> 01:02:46.029]  And they started looking a bit embarrassed at that point.
[01:02:46.189 --> 01:02:47.991]  And then I just started talking about HSBC.
[01:02:47.991 --> 01:02:51.194]  There's a lot of HSBC there this year.
[01:02:51.194 --> 01:02:56.700]  And they've literally, just a few days ago, had to pay £28 million to the Swiss banking authorities for money laundering.
[01:02:56.700 --> 01:02:59.022]  And that's just right over the mountains in Switzerland.
[01:02:59.022 --> 01:02:59.603]  That's going on.
[01:03:00.495 --> 01:03:12.227]  Yeah, and in fact, if you look at the list of participants, you'll see that there's a member of the very senior Swiss banking official from Geneva is also one of the attendees.
[01:03:12.227 --> 01:03:18.153]  So we've got the people basically over the regulations of banking, they're meeting with the HSBC people.
[01:03:18.153 --> 01:03:20.935]  I mean, this isn't a conflict of interest.
[01:03:21.596 --> 01:03:22.417]  Yeah, not just that.
[01:03:22.417 --> 01:03:31.823]  There's the HSBC's Chief Legal Officer is there, as well as the Group Chairman, and the British Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne.
[01:03:31.823 --> 01:03:33.504]  Who's overbanking?
[01:03:33.504 --> 01:03:34.245]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:03:34.245 --> 01:03:41.370]  So it couldn't be a more sort of sick little cluster going on for three days in private, in absolute private.
[01:03:42.574 --> 01:03:47.357]  This is not your granddaddy's smoky room, as our reporter Takari Jackson put it.
[01:03:47.357 --> 01:03:51.000]  I mean, this looks like something out of a science fiction movie.
[01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:56.464]  Folks have seen Dune, the movie with the spaceships on the landing field.
[01:03:56.464 --> 01:04:03.629]  The hotel looks like some bizarre science fiction spaceship that's landed, and it's there in the middle of the Alps.
[01:04:03.629 --> 01:04:05.630]  It's just a bizarre scene.
[01:04:05.630 --> 01:04:10.754]  It does look like it's about to sort of retract its wheels and take off into the skies.
[01:04:12.662 --> 01:04:15.184]  Yeah, it's a strange place.
[01:04:15.184 --> 01:04:28.111]  When you think about the amount of money being spent by the state on policing this, on essentially stopping reporting happening, and things like the... I know you reported on one radar mast.
[01:04:28.111 --> 01:04:35.395]  I know there's also a military radar station, which we found out about a couple of months ago, just again down from the hotel.
[01:04:35.395 --> 01:04:40.919]  So there's a lot of military here, there's a lot of state police, but all of this money they're putting into it.
[01:04:41.579 --> 01:04:51.105]  All of that money, they just can't find a line in their budget for a press centre and some proper accreditation, like the G7 does.
[01:04:51.105 --> 01:04:52.206]  Well, what about England?
[01:04:52.206 --> 01:04:53.627]  I mean, the police were so nice.
[01:04:53.627 --> 01:04:56.028]  We had 3,500 people there.
[01:04:56.028 --> 01:04:57.389]  You helped put on the whole event.
[01:04:57.389 --> 01:04:58.690]  It was a huge success.
[01:04:58.690 --> 01:04:59.491]  We exposed it.
[01:04:59.491 --> 01:05:02.733]  The media said, yeah, it's a criminal lobbying group.
[01:05:02.733 --> 01:05:08.777]  I mean, what's the difference between the UK police, who aren't perfect by any stretch of the imagination, compared to the Austrian police?
[01:05:09.775 --> 01:05:21.389]  Well clearly the decision had been made in the UK and I think also in Denmark the year after to liaise with the press and with protesters and to enable their actions.
[01:05:21.389 --> 01:05:25.494]  So in both cases of Copenhagen and Watford we were
[01:05:26.315 --> 01:05:41.465]  We were given a hand by, you know, I'm not being an apologist for when the police do bad things, of course, but in those two instances it did seem like the police were working to help us both cover the conferences.
[01:05:41.465 --> 01:05:48.049]  Well I had the police tell me, I had the state, federal and locals all tell me they don't like Bilderberg.
[01:05:48.049 --> 01:05:49.790]  Absolutely, I mean I remember hearing that in
[01:05:50.888 --> 01:05:51.449]  Yeah, I think so.
[01:06:06.411 --> 01:06:08.551]  Seeming to be the most sympathetic at the moment.
[01:06:08.551 --> 01:06:12.852]  Yeah, no, it's the famous, it's the famous cliché, and it's a cliché because it's true.
[01:06:12.852 --> 01:06:21.294]  A certain percentage of the Germanic folks love authority, and all they know is it's the big evil hotel with the big wigs there, and they're going to grovel to it.
[01:06:21.294 --> 01:06:21.994]  We'll be back.
[01:06:21.994 --> 01:06:23.054]  Stay there.
[01:06:23.054 --> 01:06:28.175]  I want to learn what you think's on the agenda that we haven't learned yet, who may be on the list and not on the list.
[01:06:28.175 --> 01:06:34.276]  Charlie Skelton from The Guardian, raided at 1am, drug out in his underwear, and he's calmly taking it.
[01:06:35.268 --> 01:06:35.730]  I'm good.
[01:06:40.959 --> 01:06:43.221]  All right, Charlie Skelton, final segment with him.
[01:06:43.221 --> 01:06:47.283]  He's on a deadline to get out his latest report.
[01:06:47.283 --> 01:06:50.806]  Charlie, you know, they come into your place, they take you back out of the car.
[01:06:50.806 --> 01:06:54.188]  I mean, this is really outrageous in a Western country.
[01:06:54.188 --> 01:06:58.991]  It's what I expect to hear from a third world nation.
[01:06:58.991 --> 01:07:10.499]  I mean, I know you don't like to draw attention to yourself, but I think journalists should rally to your aid and others' aid because we've really seen an attack on journalists the last few years across the Western world that's unprecedented.
[01:07:12.076 --> 01:07:22.920]  Yeah, I mean, I think that the way to do it, I think, is to try and push for, in this instance, to push for press accreditation and for a press centre and to build relationships.
[01:07:22.920 --> 01:07:26.841]  Because the more you can build relationships, the less exposed you feel.
[01:07:26.841 --> 01:07:31.123]  And I guess that also applies to relationships between journalists.
[01:07:31.123 --> 01:07:34.584]  But, you know, there's precious little journalism going on when you
[01:07:35.924 --> 01:07:50.267]  In the mainstream media, when you look at what went on in the G7, where there was this kind of pre-packaged stuff being fed out from the government, all this pooled footage and photos being kind of regurgitated and chewed over.
[01:07:50.267 --> 01:07:54.368]  And it didn't strike me that that was particularly real journalism.
[01:07:54.368 --> 01:08:01.130]  Whereas, you know, seeing your guys out there and climbing up a mountain and taking photos of radar masts and that kind of thing, that's actually
[01:08:01.950 --> 01:08:03.471]  You know, it's not easy to do.
[01:08:03.471 --> 01:08:06.312]  And I think, I don't think journalism should be that easy.
[01:08:06.312 --> 01:08:07.053]  That's a good point.
[01:08:07.053 --> 01:08:13.756]  Modern so-called journalists just sit there, get a government or corporate press release, republish it and put their name on it.
[01:08:13.756 --> 01:08:14.677]  It's all press releases.
[01:08:14.677 --> 01:08:17.958]  I mean, the whole of the G7 was a huge press release.
[01:08:17.958 --> 01:08:26.223]  And it kind of, it was, to be inside it and to be in that, within the press center, this giant thing held in an ice skating center was, it was very surreal at times.
[01:08:26.223 --> 01:08:28.664]  And it was surreal because everyone was taking it seriously.
[01:08:28.664 --> 01:08:30.505]  It was like they were looking at photos of a pantomime.
[01:08:31.225 --> 01:08:37.211]  And Goldilocks was up on the screen and they were all going, oh my God, Goldilocks looks like she's in trouble.
[01:08:37.211 --> 01:08:42.696]  You know, it was like that kind of seriousness of the whole thing and that's what was, it was like cognitive dissonance I felt.
[01:08:42.696 --> 01:08:48.642]  Sure, what do you make of the armored vehicle rolling up to you and nine other journalists like you were terrorists?
[01:08:49.861 --> 01:08:50.982]  Well, it's kind of bizarre.
[01:08:50.982 --> 01:08:54.424]  I mean, it's part, I suppose, of the general militarization of police.
[01:08:54.424 --> 01:09:02.010]  I suppose there's so much of this equipment that's just finding its way and trickling back into the domestic police forces, which is a bit grim.
[01:09:02.010 --> 01:09:04.211]  And I guess in America you have a lot more of that.
[01:09:04.211 --> 01:09:07.533]  Every town has one store and a tank.
[01:09:09.995 --> 01:09:12.876]  It's kind of weird, and it's just such overkill.
[01:09:12.876 --> 01:09:14.216]  I mean, it's so unnecessary.
[01:09:14.216 --> 01:09:21.378]  In fact, the policing and the checkpoints are so heavy that there's precious little few people out here, you know, standing even by the gates.
[01:09:21.378 --> 01:09:25.279]  It's very small this year.
[01:09:25.279 --> 01:09:31.821]  I have seen one mainstream journalist, which is good, but unfortunately she was in a Mercedes being driven up to the hotel.
[01:09:31.821 --> 01:09:34.322]  She's the editor of a Norwegian newspaper.
[01:09:36.002 --> 01:09:38.045]  So yeah, I guess I've seen one mainstream journalist.
[01:09:38.045 --> 01:09:38.526]  So that's good.
[01:09:38.526 --> 01:09:39.467]  That's a start.
[01:09:39.467 --> 01:09:41.410]  They're inside and promise not to talk.
[01:09:41.410 --> 01:09:44.234]  In closing, we know some of their agenda.
[01:09:44.234 --> 01:09:47.178]  What do you think this year's Bilderberg is really all about?
[01:09:47.178 --> 01:09:52.565]  And how would you summarize other key points as a journalist that you're witnessing?
[01:09:53.476 --> 01:10:09.605]  Well, from the agenda, obviously, the AI leaps out with Google DeepMind and the general shift of Bilderberg towards high tech and towards those spheres, you know, with people like Peter Thiel from Facebook and Alex Karp from Palantir and Schmidt from Google, etc.
[01:10:09.605 --> 01:10:10.606]  and Mundi from Microsoft.
[01:10:10.606 --> 01:10:15.829]  These are big players in the tech field and it's very interesting to see their presence and their power is growing within Bilderberg.
[01:10:16.309 --> 01:10:19.650]  So that's interesting, and I guess also Greece is a big thing.
[01:10:19.650 --> 01:10:26.272]  You've got a member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, you've got two European Finance Ministers, three European Prime Ministers.
[01:10:26.272 --> 01:10:29.633]  They're going to be talking about Greece and the Grexits.
[01:10:29.633 --> 01:10:37.635]  And they're going to be talking about it with all these predators, like people like Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank and Morgan Stanley and Lazard and HSBC, etc, etc.
[01:10:37.635 --> 01:10:38.475]  The list goes on.
[01:10:38.475 --> 01:10:41.296]  But you know, not a single Greek-serving politician will be there.
[01:10:43.296 --> 01:10:50.579]  If I was the Finance Minister Yanis of Greece, I'd be wanting to come here now.
[01:10:50.579 --> 01:10:59.462]  It can't make them happy that the UK wants to get a vote on staying in the EU, something that never got to be put in the EU before.
[01:10:59.462 --> 01:11:04.644]  I noticed they've got some of the media people there as well that are big on keeping the UK in the EU.
[01:11:04.644 --> 01:11:09.446]  I noticed some of those folks got invited into Bilderberg and we know that it ties into TPP as well.
[01:11:10.316 --> 01:11:10.576]  Absolutely.
[01:11:10.576 --> 01:11:12.277]  Well, everything does at the moment.
[01:11:12.277 --> 01:11:15.738]  Yeah, everything ties into the big trade agreements.
[01:11:15.738 --> 01:11:20.499]  And there's some key lobbyists for that here at Bildberg, you know, at the very top level.
[01:11:20.499 --> 01:11:26.581]  And you could almost describe the whole meeting as a lobbying opportunity for these trade groups.
[01:11:26.581 --> 01:11:28.482]  Why do you think they're targeting you so much?
[01:11:28.482 --> 01:11:33.003]  Because my reporters said it days ago when you first got there that they were seen to be targeting you.
[01:11:33.003 --> 01:11:34.464]  And I don't think there's any doubt of that now.
[01:11:36.169 --> 01:11:39.490]  Well, I'm just flattered to get any kind of attention.
[01:11:39.490 --> 01:11:46.214]  I suppose once a year I get, you know, I get stripped of my underwear and chat to a policeman and it's nice.
[01:11:46.214 --> 01:11:48.755]  And I should point out, by the way, that I stripped.
[01:11:48.755 --> 01:11:49.835]  I wasn't stripped.
[01:11:49.835 --> 01:11:53.417]  No, I understand, but you're in your place and then they take you back outside.
[01:11:53.417 --> 01:11:55.698]  I was being a bit sarcastic there.
[01:11:55.698 --> 01:11:56.678]  What are you going to do next?
[01:11:56.678 --> 01:11:58.119]  Or maybe you can't say.
[01:11:59.389 --> 01:12:00.530]  Next now.
[01:12:00.530 --> 01:12:02.533]  Yes.
[01:12:02.533 --> 01:12:05.016]  I just carry on trying to report.
[01:12:05.016 --> 01:12:06.117]  You know, it's all you can do.
[01:12:06.117 --> 01:12:12.005]  All you can do is turn up and do your best to report on events.
[01:12:12.005 --> 01:12:12.826]  I mean, it's very simple.
[01:12:13.769 --> 01:12:20.453]  We're talking to a rare man, a real journalist who works for a major media outlet, Charlie Skelton from The Guardian.
[01:12:20.453 --> 01:12:21.154]  Thank you so much.
[01:12:21.154 --> 01:12:23.595]  We'll cover your action here every day.
[01:12:23.595 --> 01:12:23.935]  Thank you.
[01:12:23.935 --> 01:12:25.316]  We're on the march.
[01:12:25.316 --> 01:12:27.278]  The empire's on the run.
[01:12:27.278 --> 01:12:28.078]  Mark Dice coming up.
[01:12:28.078 --> 01:12:30.520]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:12:43.266 --> 01:12:47.349]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[01:12:47.349 --> 01:12:53.574]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:12:53.574 --> 01:13:02.441]  I went out walking through streets paved with gold.
[01:13:02.441 --> 01:13:08.546]  Lifted some stones, saw the skin and bones of a city without a soul.
[01:13:11.321 --> 01:13:29.415]  I went out walking Under an atomic sky Where the ground won't turn And the rain it burns Like the tears when I said goodbye Yeah, I went with nothing
[01:13:31.036 --> 01:13:57.274]  Nothing but the thought of you I went wandering I went drifting through the capitals of tin Where men can't walk or freely talk And sons turn their fathers in
[01:13:59.435 --> 01:14:03.476]  Johnny Cash bringing us in.
[01:14:03.476 --> 01:14:11.718]  Bilderberg deploys giant Stingray to grab all digital communications.
[01:14:11.718 --> 01:14:15.939]  That story is up on Infowars.com.
[01:14:28.865 --> 01:14:32.807]  It's also jamming communications.
[01:14:32.807 --> 01:14:36.908]  We also have linked up there the Mark Dice video that's also on DrudgeReport.com.
[01:14:36.908 --> 01:14:49.573]  We'll put that article on screen.
[01:14:49.573 --> 01:14:56.876]  Obama zombies Americans sign prankster petition to nuke Russia video.
[01:14:59.451 --> 01:15:03.634]  Doesn't that just say everything?
[01:15:03.634 --> 01:15:11.539]  And he's done more than a hundred of these videos, I would guess, where he comes up and says, I want to put all gun owners for Obama in forced labor camps.
[01:15:11.539 --> 01:15:13.721]  They go, yeah, I'm sick of these people.
[01:15:13.721 --> 01:15:15.862]  We want to put all Republicans in death camps.
[01:15:15.862 --> 01:15:18.524]  Yes, we want to burn the Jews for Obama.
[01:15:18.524 --> 01:15:19.585]  I mean, you can say anything.
[01:15:19.585 --> 01:15:20.785]  For Obama, they say yes.
[01:15:20.785 --> 01:15:24.148]  Well now, nuke Russia for Obama.
[01:15:25.029 --> 01:15:30.773]  This is political correctness, just mindless idiots who have no intellectual acumen, who have nothing.
[01:15:30.773 --> 01:15:34.836]  They just are good, and everybody else is racist, and everybody else is bad.
[01:15:34.836 --> 01:15:47.284]  In fact, I never even played the clip of Seinfeld, Jerry Seinfeld doing an interview, and his daughter's like 13, and they said, hey, you want to move back into New York City so you can meet more boys?
[01:15:47.284 --> 01:15:48.925]  And their daughter said, that's sexist.
[01:15:48.925 --> 01:15:50.787]  Girls liking boys is bad.
[01:15:50.787 --> 01:15:52.948]  And they said, you're joking, right?
[01:15:52.948 --> 01:15:53.469]  And she said, no.
[01:15:54.329 --> 01:15:57.130]  You see, men and women together is bad.
[01:15:57.130 --> 01:16:01.250]  All men are rapists.
[01:16:01.250 --> 01:16:04.191]  This is the mind control.
[01:16:04.191 --> 01:16:06.572]  You could say ban men for Obama.
[01:16:06.572 --> 01:16:09.412]  And I guess women would sign it.
[01:16:09.412 --> 01:16:12.073]  We've gone out in Austin, you know, hey, let's kill babies up to age five.
[01:16:12.073 --> 01:16:15.614]  Sure, it was for Obama.
[01:16:15.614 --> 01:16:19.054]  As long as it's for Obama.
[01:16:19.054 --> 01:16:22.055]  How do you like your doubling, tripling healthcare cost that was supposed to be free?
[01:16:24.045 --> 01:16:24.986]  It's the mind control.
[01:16:24.986 --> 01:16:25.987]  So Mark Dice joins us.
[01:16:25.987 --> 01:16:27.348]  He has a new book out.
[01:16:27.348 --> 01:16:28.630]  He's written a bunch of books.
[01:16:28.630 --> 01:16:30.071]  They're excellent.
[01:16:30.071 --> 01:16:31.933]  And the new book breaks down the Bilderberg Group.
[01:16:31.933 --> 01:16:34.135]  We'll talk about that with him some in a moment.
[01:16:34.135 --> 01:16:35.356]  We can put that up on screen as well.
[01:16:35.356 --> 01:16:37.898]  The Bilderberg Group, Facts and Fiction.
[01:16:37.898 --> 01:16:41.742]  So we can get his take on Bilderberg Group as well today.
[01:16:41.742 --> 01:16:44.785]  But Mark Dice, media analyst, joins us.
[01:16:44.785 --> 01:16:48.389]  Mark, we're going to play this video here in a moment, but I tell you,
[01:16:49.386 --> 01:16:51.190]  I've been out there to California.
[01:16:51.190 --> 01:16:52.092]  I've seen it myself.
[01:16:52.092 --> 01:16:55.298]  I've seen it at UT and other trendy areas.
[01:16:55.298 --> 01:16:57.322]  This is a cult of idiots.
[01:16:57.322 --> 01:16:58.404]  Paul Watson had an article...
[01:16:59.827 --> 01:17:02.288]  Last week titled, The Rise of the Idiots.
[01:17:02.288 --> 01:17:08.130]  In the West, the IQ points are down 14% in just the last 20 years.
[01:17:08.130 --> 01:17:19.795]  We are not just dumb from not being trained and not being educated, but we are dumb because of the environment we're in, whatever's causing it, the fluoride, the rest of it.
[01:17:19.795 --> 01:17:26.998]  But, I mean, this is the rise of the fascistic idiots who can hardly talk, but can say, I love Obama.
[01:17:30.740 --> 01:17:33.921]  Hey, you know, I don't want to open our borders up and pay for it.
[01:17:33.921 --> 01:17:35.041]  Shut up, racist.
[01:17:35.041 --> 01:17:38.322]  I don't want to have my health care written by foreign insurance companies with death panels.
[01:17:38.322 --> 01:17:39.642]  Shut up, racist.
[01:17:39.642 --> 01:17:44.684]  All they know is racist, racist, racist, Pollyanna racist, Pollyanna sexist, racist, racist.
[01:17:44.684 --> 01:17:45.424]  I'm an intellectual.
[01:17:45.424 --> 01:17:46.125]  I'm an intellectual.
[01:17:46.125 --> 01:17:47.965]  Racist, racist, racist, racist.
[01:17:47.965 --> 01:17:48.765]  I love Satan.
[01:17:48.765 --> 01:17:49.726]  I kill my babies.
[01:17:49.726 --> 01:17:50.486]  I love Mao.
[01:17:50.486 --> 01:17:51.606]  Racist, racist.
[01:17:51.606 --> 01:17:52.727]  I mean, and I'm not joking.
[01:17:52.727 --> 01:17:55.688]  I can play clips of feminists running around screaming, I love Satan.
[01:17:56.548 --> 01:17:58.810]  I love killing babies with their tongues hanging out.
[01:17:58.810 --> 01:17:59.850]  Hell Satan.
[01:17:59.850 --> 01:18:05.114]  I mean this is perhaps they don't have souls and this is some interdimensional demonic infestation.
[01:18:05.114 --> 01:18:07.936]  I mean I'm joking but maybe I'm not.
[01:18:07.936 --> 01:18:09.297]  Mark Dice what do you have to say?
[01:18:09.297 --> 01:18:16.042]  I think we're having some Skype problems.
[01:18:16.042 --> 01:18:16.982]  I got audio now.
[01:18:16.982 --> 01:18:17.783]  Okay good.
[01:18:17.783 --> 01:18:18.964]  What do you say to all this?
[01:18:18.964 --> 01:18:20.565]  I mean how dumb are they going to get?
[01:18:22.299 --> 01:18:23.100]  It's amazing.
[01:18:23.100 --> 01:18:34.687]  I mean, I didn't hear the intro there, but as you saw, as the audience maybe knows, this video outraged Russians because we're kind of used to this kind of political comedy, I guess, but it's a tragedy.
[01:18:34.687 --> 01:18:40.451]  And so I've been getting emails from a lot of major Russian newspapers and television networks, not just RT, I'm talking about Russian
[01:18:42.551 --> 01:18:44.372]  They're absolutely outraged and stunned.
[01:18:44.372 --> 01:19:03.047]  I don't think, obviously the humor probably didn't transfer over, but to see the fact that an American citizen, or a whole bunch of them, would be willing to launch a nuclear strike at this day and age, decades after the Cold War has ended, is absolutely stunning and has appalled them.
[01:19:03.047 --> 01:19:04.928]  We are in the idiocracy.
[01:19:04.928 --> 01:19:06.429]  It can't get much worse.
[01:19:06.429 --> 01:19:12.434]  These are like three-year-old children that I just order them around and they obey and
[01:19:12.534 --> 01:19:13.074]  They don't think.
[01:19:13.074 --> 01:19:14.676]  They obey Obama.
[01:19:14.676 --> 01:19:20.281]  It's absolutely incredible, especially this far into the Obama presidency, when he has failed at everything.
[01:19:20.281 --> 01:19:22.322]  He's backtracked on just about every promise.
[01:19:22.322 --> 01:19:24.544]  He's expanded the Orwellian wiretapping.
[01:19:24.544 --> 01:19:25.165]  Mark, I'm going to stop you.
[01:19:25.165 --> 01:19:26.446]  I'm going to stop you and then give you the floor.
[01:19:26.446 --> 01:19:27.787]  But you just said something incredible.
[01:19:27.787 --> 01:19:29.368]  They accidentally had you potted down.
[01:19:29.368 --> 01:19:37.776]  You couldn't hear my three-minute, four-minute rant intro about your book and how these are zombies and how dumb they are and how they're not even really liberals.
[01:19:38.416 --> 01:19:50.645]  How they're just in this cult of just using magic words and what Jerry Seinfeld said about political correctness, and then you come on and say exactly what I was saying without even hearing me, because it's veritas, it's truth.
[01:19:50.645 --> 01:19:54.547]  These people are a dangerous cult of sick freaks.
[01:19:54.547 --> 01:19:55.228]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[01:19:56.292 --> 01:20:00.074]  You can see, sometimes I didn't even get to finish to mention that it was about nuking.
[01:20:00.074 --> 01:20:02.355]  I just said, hey, will you help Obama?
[01:20:02.355 --> 01:20:04.216]  And they were just more than willing to help.
[01:20:04.216 --> 01:20:10.378]  These are people who probably were too lazy to get up and drive to the polls and go and vote or send in an absentee ballot.
[01:20:10.378 --> 01:20:16.341]  But if you just put a petition in front of them and give them a pen and they just feel, hey, all I need to do is sign to help Obama.
[01:20:16.721 --> 01:20:25.667]  And you can see in these last few videos, I've added an Obama shirt just to add to the overall theme of supporting Obama.
[01:20:25.667 --> 01:20:26.528]  It's incredible, man.
[01:20:26.528 --> 01:20:39.077]  I mean, obviously not everybody signed the petition, but the fact that anybody would sign this and not pick up, and in some of these instances, I mean, I'm repeating myself three different times as they're signing it, this is to nuke Russia.
[01:20:43.251 --> 01:20:49.917]  Maybe they think a nuclear strike means that it's like a strike, workers striking, they're not going to go and work.
[01:20:49.917 --> 01:21:01.666]  Maybe society has gotten so dumbed down, Alex, that maybe some of these people, I'm thinking, hopefully, they think that a nuclear strike is opposing a nuclear attack.
[01:21:01.666 --> 01:21:04.749]  It's astounding, and I understand why the Russians are so upset.
[01:21:05.883 --> 01:21:18.970]  I just saw a video this morning, a Russian journalist attempted to do the same thing over in Russia, asking his people to sign a petition to nuke Americans, and it was something only like 2 out of 30 people signed the petition.
[01:21:18.970 --> 01:21:28.716]  I never thought I would be starting a potential international incident, but this is what's happening in America, particularly Southern California, which may be an extra special brand of stupid.
[01:21:29.497 --> 01:21:32.240]  But of course, they're smarter than us because they're liberal.
[01:21:32.240 --> 01:21:37.266]  It doesn't matter if we're real classical liberals, paleo-conservatives, whatever you want to call us.
[01:21:37.266 --> 01:21:41.912]  They can just wave a wand and feel better just calling us racist or sexist or whatever.
[01:21:41.912 --> 01:21:47.138]  But a lot of times I talk to you, I talk to my reporters, usually about 9 out of 10
[01:21:48.439 --> 01:21:50.861]  We'll say, turn in all our guns for Obama.
[01:21:50.861 --> 01:21:54.183]  About 7 out of 10 say put conservatives in forced labor camps.
[01:21:54.183 --> 01:21:57.826]  And then they speak perfect English and they'll go, oh don't tell me about it buddy, I'm sick of these people.
[01:21:57.826 --> 01:21:58.647]  Let's put them in a camp.
[01:21:58.647 --> 01:22:01.028]  You know, you have that famous video.
[01:22:01.028 --> 01:22:06.492]  But when you look at this, it's just so flabbergasting what a cult they're in.
[01:22:06.492 --> 01:22:10.675]  Because beyond just being stupid, they want to submit to that gang.
[01:22:10.675 --> 01:22:15.419]  But what percentage of people, how many did you talk to, how many said, yes let's nuke Russia?
[01:22:16.909 --> 01:22:21.792]  A lot of people just simply don't want to pay any attention to somebody bothering them on the beach with a petition.
[01:22:21.792 --> 01:22:25.294]  So a lot of people just keep walking and they don't even pay any attention to what I'm saying.
[01:22:25.294 --> 01:22:27.256]  They just say no thank you and they keep on walking.
[01:22:27.256 --> 01:22:30.998]  But out of the people who stop, I mean the vast majority of them will stop.
[01:22:34.261 --> 01:22:34.641]  We're good.
[01:22:58.726 --> 01:23:04.630]  40, 50 different petition videos, man on the streets, repealing the Bill of Rights.
[01:23:04.630 --> 01:23:05.411]  It's just incredible.
[01:23:05.411 --> 01:23:12.476]  I mean, some of these videos take 10 minutes, 15 minutes to shoot, and the majority of that time is me standing there waiting for somebody to come by.
[01:23:12.476 --> 01:23:15.798]  Because I usually will target, you know, somebody that's by themselves.
[01:23:15.798 --> 01:23:17.399]  If there's a group of people, somebody's gonna
[01:23:18.121 --> 01:23:19.442]  Have a lightbulb go off in their head.
[01:23:19.442 --> 01:23:25.305]  The odds are if it's a family of three, four, five people, somebody might have a lightbulb go off in their head and get it.
[01:23:25.305 --> 01:23:28.626]  So I'll usually just target one person that's walking by themselves.
[01:23:28.626 --> 01:23:35.330]  And I do use the power of suggestion to demonstrate what it is that the president does.
[01:23:35.330 --> 01:23:41.813]  To demonstrate how the mainstream media is able to just repeat a lie over and over a few times and people just start to believe it through the power of suggestion.
[01:23:42.533 --> 01:23:43.754]  And I'm just a guy in a t-shirt.
[01:23:43.754 --> 01:23:45.516]  I don't have a badge.
[01:23:45.516 --> 01:23:48.018]  I don't have a suit.
[01:23:48.018 --> 01:23:55.303]  Just from telling them, before they start to think, some of them might not have done it, might have had a light bulb go off in their head, but I derail their thinking.
[01:23:55.303 --> 01:23:57.505]  You can see by just repeating myself.
[01:23:57.505 --> 01:23:58.906]  Yeah, but it's not just that.
[01:23:58.906 --> 01:24:01.448]  I mean, some of your critics say that, and I'm sure some of them.
[01:24:01.448 --> 01:24:04.130]  I mean, you're using sales tactics, but you're very calm.
[01:24:04.130 --> 01:24:05.130]  You repeat it three times.
[01:24:05.991 --> 01:24:09.734]  If you look at some of the liberals, I mean, these look like professors and people that are well-spoken.
[01:24:09.734 --> 01:24:13.576]  They're like, yeah, we just gotta put the Republicans in forced labor camps and take their guns.
[01:24:13.576 --> 01:24:14.357]  I've had enough of them.
[01:24:14.357 --> 01:24:15.417]  The guy's like, I hear you, man.
[01:24:15.417 --> 01:24:16.438]  You don't have to tell me.
[01:24:16.438 --> 01:24:17.559]  I'm sick of these people.
[01:24:17.559 --> 01:24:23.883]  I mean, a lot of them know what they're doing when you're saying, let's put the Jews back in ovens for Obama.
[01:24:23.883 --> 01:24:25.664]  I mean, they know what they're signing.
[01:24:25.664 --> 01:24:29.887]  They just can't say no because you put the word Obama in front of it.
[01:24:29.887 --> 01:24:33.249]  You're simply illustrating that that's the cult they're in.
[01:24:37.286 --> 01:24:48.250]  One of the petition videos was to ban any display, public display, t-shirts, bumper stickers, etc., of any religious symbols, which would be a clear violation of the First Amendment, and these liberals couldn't wait to sign up.
[01:24:48.250 --> 01:24:50.370]  I mean, there's no power of suggestion.
[01:24:50.370 --> 01:24:54.872]  They just wanted to ban Christian symbols, bumper stickers, and t-shirts.
[01:24:55.052 --> 01:24:55.212]  Sure.
[01:25:10.034 --> 01:25:10.174]  Sure.
[01:25:10.174 --> 01:25:10.314]  Sure.
[01:25:10.314 --> 01:25:15.255]  I want to play your powerful report that's on DrudgeReport.com, Infowars.com, you name it, and all over Russian news, all over some US news now.
[01:25:32.014 --> 01:25:34.196]  Beyond jaywalking, I mean, these are the real people.
[01:25:34.196 --> 01:25:36.418]  And I'm not insulting so-called liberals.
[01:25:36.418 --> 01:25:42.323]  You go to so-called liberal areas, they are the dumbest, most suggestible people on the planet.
[01:25:42.323 --> 01:25:45.986]  I know Republicans get pretty bad as well when they think their guy's in power.
[01:25:45.986 --> 01:25:48.608]  So it's kind of a mob psychology.
[01:25:48.608 --> 01:25:53.513]  But you call them zombies.
[01:25:53.513 --> 01:25:55.494]  Ted Cruz calls them the fascist left.
[01:25:56.613 --> 01:25:58.356]  I just call them a cult of dumbasses.
[01:25:58.356 --> 01:26:04.005]  I mean, I don't know what you call these people, but it's scary to know this is who's taking over America.
[01:26:04.005 --> 01:26:06.369]  I want to play your report.
[01:26:06.369 --> 01:26:07.170]  Here it is, folks.
[01:26:08.200 --> 01:26:11.061]  We just need a couple more signatures.
[01:26:11.061 --> 01:26:18.823]  This one's to support President Obama's new plan to deal with Russia, and they're violating the UN.
[01:26:18.823 --> 01:26:25.045]  They're violating the UN sanctions, so we're going to launch a preemptive nuclear strike.
[01:26:25.045 --> 01:26:30.887]  A birthday to support the nuclear strike against Russia, and a signature.
[01:26:30.887 --> 01:26:32.648]  Really appreciate that.
[01:26:32.648 --> 01:26:36.189]  This is the one way we can maintain our superiority.
[01:26:36.189 --> 01:26:36.929]  Thank you so much.
[01:26:39.867 --> 01:26:52.073]  President Obama has decided to implement some new sanctions in order to prevent some trade imbalances, Prince's birthday and his signature.
[01:26:52.073 --> 01:27:04.019]  And part of the plan to deal with Russia is to launch a preemptive nuclear strike, which will help to maintain America's superiority in the world.
[01:27:04.019 --> 01:27:08.541]  I appreciate your supporting a nuclear attack on Russia.
[01:27:09.364 --> 01:27:09.919]  Thank you so much.
[01:27:11.673 --> 01:27:14.615]  Okay, here, just real quick, we're just getting signatures.
[01:27:14.615 --> 01:27:25.240]  You've seen that Russia has been threatening the United States lately and trying to flex their international muscle, violating all sorts of treaties.
[01:27:25.240 --> 01:27:39.067]  Well, this is to support Obama's plan for a preemptive nuclear strike to Russia, just to send them a message that we are still the world's first and only superpower.
[01:27:40.928 --> 01:27:46.869]  Print here a birthdate and a signature just to support America real quick.
[01:27:46.869 --> 01:27:49.310]  I have lived in America all my life.
[01:27:49.310 --> 01:27:50.850]  You're an American.
[01:27:50.850 --> 01:27:55.991]  We need to get behind the political power.
[01:27:55.991 --> 01:28:02.212]  Print birthdate and a signature to support the preemptive nuclear strike.
[01:28:02.212 --> 01:28:05.553]  I hope he doesn't disappoint me because this is the only thing I've really signed for him.
[01:28:05.553 --> 01:28:09.594]  Birthdate to support the nuclear strike against Russia.
[01:28:11.745 --> 01:28:22.160]  And the patriotic thing to do these days, signature, to send Russia a message with a preemptive nuclear strike.
[01:28:22.160 --> 01:28:23.222]  Thank you for supporting that.
[01:28:23.222 --> 01:28:24.303]  Let's hope he doesn't disappoint me.
[01:28:25.123 --> 01:28:33.168]  President's plan to launch the preemptive nuclear demonstration against Russia for violating the... No thanks, man.
[01:28:33.168 --> 01:28:38.672]  We're just trying to show support for... We need 100,000 signatures to support Obama's plan.
[01:28:38.672 --> 01:28:40.053]  You can tell that last guy was a vet.
[01:28:40.053 --> 01:28:42.315]  I mean, he looked at you like you were crazy.
[01:28:42.315 --> 01:28:43.175]  And that's the problem.
[01:28:43.175 --> 01:28:44.676]  So many people have not been in the military.
[01:28:44.676 --> 01:28:46.757]  They just have no idea we're talking about the end of the world here.
[01:28:46.757 --> 01:28:50.220]  You gotta go out and ask him to support the end of the world for Obama.
[01:28:50.220 --> 01:28:52.561]  And, you know, blowing the planet up to stop racism.
[01:28:52.561 --> 01:28:54.282]  You know, the planet's just too racist and...
[01:28:55.243 --> 01:28:57.584]  God tried to destroy it with water.
[01:28:57.584 --> 01:28:59.264]  Obama will do it with fire this time.
[01:28:59.264 --> 01:29:01.044]  Let's just blow the planet up for Obama.
[01:29:01.044 --> 01:29:03.025]  I mean, you know, that'll take care of the Ku Klux Klan.
[01:29:03.025 --> 01:29:05.025]  We'll kill all of them by blowing the Earth up.
[01:29:05.025 --> 01:29:06.325]  I mean, you're right, though.
[01:29:06.325 --> 01:29:10.326]  This is how they can get up on TV and say there's no drone program.
[01:29:10.326 --> 01:29:12.547]  Or Obamacare doesn't have death panels.
[01:29:12.547 --> 01:29:15.867]  Or, you know, the TPP's public but you can't read it.
[01:29:15.867 --> 01:29:20.288]  As Paul Ryan just said, I mean, it's not just the Democrats doing this.
[01:29:20.288 --> 01:29:23.249]  They're deploying the biggest lies I've ever seen, Mark Deist.
[01:29:24.602 --> 01:29:26.825]  And you can see that last guy was happy about it.
[01:29:26.825 --> 01:29:38.102]  He didn't want Obama to disappoint him by not nuking Russia and apparently these people that their brains have degenerated so far that they just can't even understand what the consequences would be.
[01:29:38.102 --> 01:29:39.684]  They're operating off of such
[01:29:39.684 --> 01:29:42.505]  Yeah, they think you're number one by killing 180 million people.
[01:29:58.615 --> 01:30:00.996]  This is what happens in an entertainment wasteland.
[01:30:00.996 --> 01:30:06.479]  We have an entire generation or two now that have just been raised on television.
[01:30:06.479 --> 01:30:12.341]  The more brutal, the more vicious the entertainment, the more entertained they are, the more they love it.
[01:30:12.341 --> 01:30:15.123]  So detached from news.
[01:30:15.123 --> 01:30:19.745]  The only information they get is through their Instagram and through their Twitter accounts.
[01:30:19.745 --> 01:30:20.885]  Let's just say it.
[01:30:20.885 --> 01:30:21.386]  They're gone.
[01:30:21.386 --> 01:30:21.986]  They're not people.
[01:30:23.585 --> 01:30:25.967]  They're subhuman zombies.
[01:30:25.967 --> 01:30:26.427]  By design.
[01:30:26.427 --> 01:30:28.128]  I mean, they're gone.
[01:30:28.128 --> 01:30:30.951]  This is what the establishment manufactures now is jellyfish heads.
[01:30:30.951 --> 01:30:31.771]  We'll be back.
[01:30:31.771 --> 01:30:40.278]  Mark Dice.
[01:30:40.278 --> 01:30:42.560]  Mark Dice is with us five minutes to the next hour.
[01:30:42.560 --> 01:30:48.685]  Then Larry Klinman with big breaking news is going to be joining us from Judicial Watch.
[01:30:51.254 --> 01:30:54.896]  There may be a microphone open in that control room, guys.
[01:30:54.896 --> 01:31:01.281]  But before we go any further, I just want to remind everyone that we're supported by viewers and listeners like you.
[01:31:01.281 --> 01:31:02.401]  Thank you so much for your support.
[01:31:02.401 --> 01:31:06.064]  Please support local AM and FM affiliates.

[01:31:09.566 --> 01:31:12.068]  We do have a limited supply back in.
[01:31:12.068 --> 01:31:16.211]  As I told you, we had some being manufactured, but we're running out of the crystals themselves.
[01:31:16.211 --> 01:31:17.572]  We're trying to procure that.
[01:31:17.572 --> 01:31:20.914]  Of the survival shield, nascent iodine X2, the purest iodine out there.
[01:31:21.714 --> 01:31:25.996]  Most people, again, have thyroid issues out there because they don't have enough iodine.
[01:31:25.996 --> 01:31:27.397]  Consult your physician first.
[01:31:27.397 --> 01:31:29.438]  But you die without this key element.
[01:31:29.438 --> 01:31:31.178]  It's the good part of the halogen family.
[01:31:31.178 --> 01:31:33.559]  We have a limited supply back in.
[01:31:33.559 --> 01:31:37.081]  Survival Shield X2 Nascent Iodine.
[01:31:37.081 --> 01:31:43.964]  Available at Infowarslife.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[01:31:43.964 --> 01:31:46.605]  A limited supply of that is back in.
[01:31:46.605 --> 01:31:49.807]  The OxyPower, the Super Mel Vitality, the Colloidal Silver,
[01:31:51.576 --> 01:31:52.357]  Silver Bullet.
[01:31:52.357 --> 01:31:52.757]  All of it.
[01:31:52.757 --> 01:31:58.343]  High quality, competitively priced, and it supports InfoWars.com and what we're doing.
[01:31:58.343 --> 01:31:59.805]  Fighting for the Second Amendment.
[01:31:59.805 --> 01:32:00.886]  Fighting for sovereignty.
[01:32:00.886 --> 01:32:02.307]  Fighting for pro-life.
[01:32:02.307 --> 01:32:04.710]  Fighting for common sense initiatives.
[01:32:04.710 --> 01:32:06.351]  Fighting for GMO labeling.
[01:32:07.113 --> 01:32:10.154]  Fighting to expose and fight the TPP.
[01:32:10.154 --> 01:32:13.796]  Infowarslife.com, Infowarsstore.com.
[01:32:13.796 --> 01:32:17.017]  We've got 20% off ProPure right now, one of the biggest sales ever.
[01:32:17.017 --> 01:32:20.239]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:32:20.239 --> 01:32:31.124]  We're also a platform for other great media analysts and activists and journalists to come on, like Charlie Skelton earlier from The Guardian, or Mark Dice of markdice.com.
[01:32:31.124 --> 01:32:33.465]  Mark, tell us a little bit about your new book.
[01:32:34.165 --> 01:32:34.886]  That I haven't read yet.
[01:32:34.886 --> 01:32:38.969]  I've read some of your others on the Bilderberg Group.
[01:32:38.969 --> 01:33:01.026]  Continuing with my Facts and Fiction series, now the latest book, the Bilderberg Group Facts and Fiction, and it chronicles the Bilderberg Group's history, their discovery, their slow exposure, particularly the last few years, thanks to social media, thanks to people like yourself, largely, and Drudge Report now for the fifth year in a row, which has been covering it.
[01:33:01.186 --> 01:33:06.869]  So, if you're new to this, or even if you've been familiar with it, you can pick up some serious pieces of the puzzle.
[01:33:06.869 --> 01:33:19.616]  A lot of people don't know that the Bilderberg Group, I mean they have a checking account, they have to have a checking account, so they have a business entity, it's called American Friends of Bilderberg here in America, and they operate as a tax-exempt charity foundation.
[01:33:23.180 --> 01:33:25.101]  So I've been able to get them.
[01:33:25.101 --> 01:33:29.142]  It shows that they're spending about a million dollars a year on the conferences.
[01:33:29.142 --> 01:33:31.002]  It shows who the donors are.
[01:33:31.002 --> 01:33:35.683]  It's quite a fascinating look into the history of the Bilderberg Group.
[01:33:35.683 --> 01:33:41.865]  And as many of your viewers know, it's been confirmed a conspiracy fact now.
[01:33:41.865 --> 01:33:44.826]  And it's incredible how such an important group of people
[01:33:45.086 --> 01:33:51.894]  You know, Jim Tucker has that famous quote about if 120 sports players were to meet, it would be big news.
[01:33:51.894 --> 01:34:00.965]  But 120 of the world's most powerful men meet in a hotel that's shut down and surrounded by armed guards and now private security, privacy fences as well.
[01:34:00.965 --> 01:34:01.686]  It's just not news.
[01:34:02.246 --> 01:34:04.109]  You can't say this isn't newsworthy.
[01:34:04.109 --> 01:34:05.790]  You can't say that it's not interesting.
[01:34:05.790 --> 01:34:11.677]  It's certainly more powerful than the G8, the G20, or Davos, any of these major world economic forums.
[01:34:11.677 --> 01:34:16.743]  But the fact that there's not a mention, and there hasn't been at least for primarily the last 60 years,
[01:34:18.164 --> 01:34:18.405]  Sure!
[01:34:32.861 --> 01:34:35.943]  These are the puppet masters they don't want us looking at.
[01:34:35.943 --> 01:34:39.265]  Folks can find your book at Amazon.com, MarkDice.com.
[01:34:39.265 --> 01:34:41.206]  We should carry it at InfowarsStore.com.
[01:34:41.206 --> 01:34:43.027]  We've carried a lot of your great work in the past.
[01:34:43.027 --> 01:34:55.235]  We're going to go to break, come back in 70 seconds and get more into the Bilderberg Group and how they control the media and have helped turn the Westerners into such dumb idiots.
[01:34:55.235 --> 01:34:58.137]  This is an American president.
[01:34:58.137 --> 01:34:59.637]  Just add puppet.
[01:34:59.637 --> 01:35:01.839]  Then vote and repeat every four years.
[01:35:10.011 --> 01:35:13.597]  Third hour, straight ahead, InfoWars.
[01:35:13.597 --> 01:35:17.103]  You are listening to GCN.
[01:35:17.103 --> 01:35:19.306]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:35:27.762 --> 01:35:29.083]  Big Brother.
[01:35:29.083 --> 01:35:30.845]  Mainstream media.
[01:35:30.845 --> 01:35:32.607]  Government cover-ups.
[01:35:32.607 --> 01:35:34.188]  You want answers?
[01:35:34.188 --> 01:35:35.750]  Well, so does he.
[01:35:35.750 --> 01:35:39.933]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:35:39.933 --> 01:35:43.997]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:35:45.258 --> 01:35:47.259]  The article's on Infowars.com.
[01:35:47.259 --> 01:35:50.200]  It instantly went up on DrudgeReport.com.
[01:35:50.200 --> 01:35:51.741]  But this is what the Brits do.
[01:35:51.741 --> 01:35:55.062]  Watson's British shows, Charlie Skelton and the Guardian.
[01:35:55.062 --> 01:35:57.763]  They water down the sensational stuff.
[01:35:57.763 --> 01:36:01.885]  They showed up, they were in his hotel room 25 minutes at 1am.
[01:36:01.885 --> 01:36:06.247]  Then they made him come outside.
[01:36:06.247 --> 01:36:09.828]  And then, you know, we're doing all this to him, shining lights in his face.
[01:36:09.828 --> 01:36:11.489]  It was like a 45 minute interrogation.
[01:36:12.472 --> 01:36:17.033]  You read the article, Guardian Journalist Gets Midnight Raid By Bilderberg Police.
[01:36:17.033 --> 01:36:18.473]  It was like a scene from Stalag 17.
[01:36:18.473 --> 01:36:27.936]  The security lockdown surrounding the 2015 Bilderberg Group Conference reached a new intensity last night when London Guardian journalist Charlie Skelton received a midnight visit.
[01:36:27.936 --> 01:36:33.637]  No, it was a raid from police who entered his hotel room, not just his hotel,
[01:36:34.893 --> 01:36:46.564]  Demanded to see his papers, after they'd already seen them 30 minutes before, and took him outside, doesn't say that, and inspected his vehicle while shining a searchlight in his face, and then he goes over it.
[01:36:46.564 --> 01:36:53.010]  Add to this armored vehicles roving around, we need to add that to the article, I know Paul wrote it fast, did a great job.
[01:36:53.530 --> 01:36:54.950]  But this is a big deal.
[01:36:54.950 --> 01:36:57.771]  We need to add the photo of the armored vehicle for journalists.
[01:36:57.771 --> 01:36:58.651]  All of it.
[01:36:58.651 --> 01:37:00.812]  What do you think they're freaking out so bad about?
[01:37:00.812 --> 01:37:06.314]  Or is this Bilderberg more important than others because they're getting ready to start World War III with Russia?
[01:37:06.314 --> 01:37:08.574]  You know, I think they're concerned with the advanced technology.
[01:37:08.574 --> 01:37:11.575]  I really think they're worried about perhaps somebody bugging the room.
[01:37:11.575 --> 01:37:22.018]  I think that they're panicking now because even though they can't hide with social media, with independent news agencies, alternative media like you becoming so popular,
[01:37:22.759 --> 01:37:27.142]  They have some serious questions to answer, and they're going to look bad no matter what.
[01:37:27.142 --> 01:37:31.645]  People are going to wonder, wait, so this has been going on for 60 years, how come I haven't heard about this?
[01:37:31.645 --> 01:37:40.551]  And in part of my past activism, I would call up to the top radio talk show hosts, Sean Hannity, Bill O'Reilly when he was on the radio, Glenn Beck,
[01:37:41.485 --> 01:37:41.885]  I don't know.
[01:38:09.667 --> 01:38:12.991]  Finger on the pulse of politics around the world.
[01:38:12.991 --> 01:38:15.214]  Don't know and haven't known for decades.
[01:38:15.214 --> 01:38:19.579]  But it was worse than that because I've heard the calls, we played them here.
[01:38:19.579 --> 01:38:23.645]  They would go, shut up conspiracy kook, nut, that's Mark Dice.
[01:38:23.645 --> 01:38:26.388]  They knew they would call you a conspiracy kook when they heard the word.
[01:38:26.388 --> 01:38:27.530]  They were saying it didn't exist.
[01:38:28.942 --> 01:38:34.864]  Yeah, now we have footage, we have smoked them out of their holes, published their tax returns.
[01:38:34.864 --> 01:38:48.488]  You know, when Hillary was running for president back in 2008, somebody approached her at a campaign event in New Hampshire and asked her what happens at the Bilderberg Group and took the video, it's on YouTube, I'm sure that you've seen it, much of your audience maybe saw the video.
[01:38:49.108 --> 01:38:51.031]  And she said, I don't know what you're talking about.
[01:38:51.031 --> 01:38:53.053]  So here we have another lie.
[01:38:53.053 --> 01:39:00.842]  We have one of the most powerful women in the world, again, who lived in the White House, husband, former president, just simply doesn't have any idea.
[01:39:00.842 --> 01:39:02.123]  She was at Bilderberg.
[01:39:02.123 --> 01:39:04.846]  She was at Bilderberg in 2008.
[01:39:04.846 --> 01:39:08.651]  And Jim Tucker reports that she was at Bilderberg back in the 90s as well.
[01:39:09.622 --> 01:39:16.469]  And so we have no politicians, with the exception of Ron Paul and his son Rand Paul.
[01:39:16.469 --> 01:39:25.838]  Nobody has mentioned the Bilderberg Group, with I guess the exception of a guy named John Rarick from the House of Representatives back in 1971, who entered in the congressional record.
[01:39:25.838 --> 01:39:29.482]  Well, that shows how powerful it is, Mark, that they will not talk about it.
[01:39:30.448 --> 01:39:48.514]  No, you're not allowed to be curious or to have any questions about 100 of the most powerful men, intelligence agency officials, media executives, reporters, military brass meeting in a hotel with privacy fences set up for three days that's evacuated.
[01:39:48.514 --> 01:39:54.016]  This is why it costs a million dollars to put on this conference every year because they have to compensate the hotel for the loss of revenue and
[01:39:54.056 --> 01:40:01.161]  Because hotels could have hundreds, perhaps a thousand rooms, and nobody is allowed in there except for the 100 or the 140.
[01:40:01.161 --> 01:40:04.363]  Mark, we've got to get you on for a full hour to break down your new book soon.
[01:40:04.363 --> 01:40:05.263]  Amazing.
[01:40:05.263 --> 01:40:14.990]  And another full hour interview just to play highlights of the most insane stuff said by fascist, brainwashed, zombie worshipper, globalist minions that we call liberals.
[01:40:14.990 --> 01:40:16.831]  Thank you so much, Mark Dice.
[01:40:16.831 --> 01:40:18.232]  We'll be back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:40:18.232 --> 01:40:18.992]  Stay with us.
[01:40:18.992 --> 01:40:19.893]  Big news straight ahead.
[01:40:28.928 --> 01:40:30.129]  Bilderberg, 2015.
[01:40:30.129 --> 01:40:36.953]  You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy.
[01:40:36.953 --> 01:40:44.938]  We must be cautious in Austria.
[01:40:44.938 --> 01:40:49.061]  We're about to be talking to Larry Klainman with big breaking news until the bottom of the hour.
[01:40:49.061 --> 01:40:53.263]  Then, 11-year-old boy kidnapped by CPS.
[01:40:53.263 --> 01:40:56.706]  Parents accused after he played in the backyard alone for 90 minutes.
[01:40:59.770 --> 01:41:03.851]  I mean, when I was six years old, I was running around the neighborhood.
[01:41:03.851 --> 01:41:07.272]  Now it's your backyard you're taking away.
[01:41:07.272 --> 01:41:11.432]  There's no law, it's just that any state calls it neglect.
[01:41:11.432 --> 01:41:16.413]  We've got London Garden reporters being raided at 1 a.m.
[01:41:16.413 --> 01:41:20.254]  at their hotel rooms in Austria for daring to cover the Bilderberg group.
[01:41:20.254 --> 01:41:22.475]  It is getting crazy.
[01:41:22.475 --> 01:41:24.435]  And that's all coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[01:41:27.307 --> 01:41:30.909]  One of my favorite actors has died.
[01:41:30.909 --> 01:41:33.130]  Christopher Lee, just an amazing actor.
[01:41:33.130 --> 01:41:34.250]  Here's the headline.
[01:41:34.250 --> 01:41:38.892]  Christopher Lee, an actor of muscular intelligence with a staggering career.
[01:41:38.892 --> 01:41:42.934]  When Mr. Kleiman leaves us, I'll talk some about that briefly.
[01:41:44.551 --> 01:41:54.818]  Larry Klayman, founder of Judicial Watch and Freedom Watch, is known for his strong public interest advocacy in furtherance of ethics in government and individual freedoms and liberties.
[01:41:54.818 --> 01:42:04.785]  During his tenure at Judicial Watch, he obtained a court ruling that Bill Clinton committed a crime, the first ever lawyer to have done so against an American president.
[01:42:04.785 --> 01:42:13.491]  Larry became so famous for fighting corruption in the government and for legal profession that NBC hit drama series West Wing created a character after him.
[01:42:14.741 --> 01:42:30.371]  His character was played by, and it just goes on, and I'm not going to break it all down, but FreedomWatchUSA.org, he's one of the most demonized people out there because the documents he gets, the research he does, is so amazingly piercing and accurate over and over again.
[01:42:31.428 --> 01:42:41.962]  We have now entered complete and sane asylum level with this government and this Justice Department and their persecution of the Tea Party, veterans, gun owners, filmmakers like Dinesh D'Souza.
[01:42:41.962 --> 01:42:44.886]  I mean, they can indict a ham sandwich.
[01:42:44.886 --> 01:42:47.109]  Republicans are basically going along with all of it.
[01:42:48.918 --> 01:42:56.503]  At the leadership level, Paul Ryan won't even, you know, he says the TPP is public, but then admits it isn't.
[01:42:56.503 --> 01:42:58.244]  Very Orwellian.
[01:42:58.244 --> 01:43:03.608]  But Mr. Klayman is on, it's a WorldNetDaily article, two members of Supreme Court targeted by U.S.
[01:43:03.608 --> 01:43:04.649]  spies.
[01:43:04.649 --> 01:43:17.998]  There's been some leaks and a lot of speculation that the Supreme Court's sudden change towards, well, being pro-gun a few years ago to now ruling against guns just last week in a San Francisco case really illustrates that they're being
[01:43:19.058 --> 01:43:20.339]  Blackmailed.
[01:43:20.339 --> 01:43:23.220]  And see, that's the problem with having a compromised president or anybody.
[01:43:23.220 --> 01:43:23.940]  They can be blackmailed.
[01:43:23.940 --> 01:43:26.221]  Look at Dennis Hastert.
[01:43:26.221 --> 01:43:30.243]  And so he's got some amazing information on this and other scandals.
[01:43:30.243 --> 01:43:34.585]  But if anybody can bring out the scandals that can maybe stop these people, it's Larry Klayman.
[01:43:34.585 --> 01:43:42.228]  But first, let me thank him for coming on and thank our listeners for supporting him and his important work in supporting one of the bravest people out there.
[01:43:42.228 --> 01:43:43.529]  But the overall climate
[01:43:44.890 --> 01:43:46.070]  Is Obama in trouble?
[01:43:46.070 --> 01:43:47.091]  Is he backing off?
[01:43:47.091 --> 01:43:48.311]  Is he more emboldened?
[01:43:48.311 --> 01:43:52.052]  He seems to be more emboldened, but everything he does falls apart.
[01:43:52.052 --> 01:43:56.593]  Kicking out our allies in Egypt, putting basically Al Qaeda in, caught running ISIS.
[01:43:56.593 --> 01:44:01.754]  I mean, it's so villainous, Larry Klayman, that I can't even believe it.
[01:44:01.754 --> 01:44:06.455]  I mean, he makes Bill Clinton look like an angel cake.
[01:44:06.455 --> 01:44:10.016]  And I know the Clintons kind of run Obama to a certain extent.
[01:44:10.016 --> 01:44:11.236]  What is going on?
[01:44:11.236 --> 01:44:12.216]  I mean, what's next?
[01:44:12.216 --> 01:44:14.097]  What's the next shoe to drop, Larry Klayman?
[01:44:15.851 --> 01:44:18.353]  Well, backing up, Alex, you're absolutely right.
[01:44:18.353 --> 01:44:26.618]  I mean, we live in an age, not just the degradation of society, but the people who are running this country have not served this country.
[01:44:26.618 --> 01:44:31.441]  In fact, they've behaved in a, in the case of Obama, in a traitorous way.
[01:44:31.441 --> 01:44:44.590]  You know, we are really up against the wall internationally in what's happening, particularly in the Middle East with ISIS and Israel and the efforts to destroy Israel's ability to be our major ally there.
[01:44:45.507 --> 01:44:48.609]  Domestically, we're pushing towards a socialized economy.
[01:44:48.609 --> 01:44:49.269]  We're already there.
[01:44:49.269 --> 01:44:53.471]  And we've got all these scandals on top of everything else.
[01:44:53.471 --> 01:44:58.474]  And one of the biggest scandals, of course, over the last few years has been the NSA scandal.
[01:44:58.474 --> 01:45:11.521]  You alluded to that in the beginning of your introduction, where the NSA and other intelligence agencies have access to all of our telephonic metadata, to our internet communications, to our social media contacts,
[01:45:12.330 --> 01:45:15.392]  And they have the ability to blackmail almost anybody they want.
[01:45:15.392 --> 01:45:20.836]  The reality here is, is that these agencies are in control of this country.
[01:45:20.836 --> 01:45:34.726]  Somebody may be behind them, but Obama, they let him do his little socialist thing and do whatever he can to destroy Israel and further Muslim interests in the Middle East, but they're playing a much bigger game here.
[01:45:35.675 --> 01:45:39.456]  And sometimes they likely return favors to each other.
[01:45:39.456 --> 01:45:44.897]  And that may help explain some of the bizarre Supreme Court decisions we've had and other kinds of rulings.
[01:45:44.897 --> 01:45:59.321]  We do know, and it's a matter of public record, that the intelligence agencies have actually penetrated the email and telephone communications of even judges in this country and representatives and senators.
[01:45:59.321 --> 01:46:01.681]  So we live in an Orwellian state.
[01:46:01.681 --> 01:46:03.822]  Judge Richard Leon made that finding
[01:46:04.714 --> 01:46:08.296]  On December 16, 2013, when he enjoined the NSA.
[01:46:08.296 --> 01:46:15.180]  By the way, I should have added that you had one of the first and only victories against the NSA in a case you brought and argued.
[01:46:15.180 --> 01:46:18.502]  So I also forgot to add that you're a top constitutional lawyer.
[01:46:18.502 --> 01:46:19.923]  Sorry.
[01:46:19.923 --> 01:46:21.884]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:46:21.884 --> 01:46:23.424]  And that's the stakes that we have here.
[01:46:23.424 --> 01:46:25.305]  We're living under the sword of Damocles.
[01:46:25.305 --> 01:46:27.887]  It's ironic that we have this issue in Syria.
[01:46:27.887 --> 01:46:29.868]  That's where it came from.
[01:46:29.868 --> 01:46:31.569]  And if you step out of line,
[01:46:32.465 --> 01:46:38.586]  If you criticize the government, if you take strong action, the government wants you to know that they can retaliate and destroy you.
[01:46:38.586 --> 01:46:42.267]  And all we're trying to do, cut and dry, is save the country.
[01:46:42.267 --> 01:46:45.608]  No one can debate shutting down our power plants will bankrupt us.
[01:46:45.608 --> 01:46:49.869]  No one can debate opening our borders outside of law and saying everything's free will bankrupt us.
[01:46:49.869 --> 01:46:52.629]  No one can debate the war on families is happening.
[01:46:52.629 --> 01:46:56.770]  I mean, it's like we have Hugo Chavez on acid running the country.
[01:46:58.444 --> 01:46:59.044]  You're right.
[01:46:59.044 --> 01:47:02.945]  Now, you know, there are good people in government, but they're not the people in control.
[01:47:02.945 --> 01:47:08.807]  And if there are good people in government, and I know a few, you have to work with them to try to change things.
[01:47:08.807 --> 01:47:11.367]  And we've had good judges over the years, a couple of them.
[01:47:11.367 --> 01:47:17.429]  There are a lot of good people, so I mean, what percentage would you say are good side, bad side?
[01:47:17.429 --> 01:47:19.669]  Well, I would say 90% are bad, at least.
[01:47:19.669 --> 01:47:21.990]  Probably that's a conservative figure.
[01:47:21.990 --> 01:47:26.211]  Either bad in the sense that they're acting in a malevolent way for their own interests,
[01:47:27.009 --> 01:47:34.655]  Like, you know, McConnell, Senator Majority Leader McConnell in the Senate, he lines his pockets along with Karl Rove on the Republican side.
[01:47:34.655 --> 01:47:39.558]  And on the Democrat side, you have Nancy Pelosi and company lining their pockets.
[01:47:39.558 --> 01:47:55.750]  So, the bottom line is, is that we don't really have any representation in Washington, and that's why I have to do what I do in my little way at Freedom Watch, and before that at Judicial Watch, and you do what you do, Alex, because we have to wage a peaceful new American revolution here.
[01:47:56.405 --> 01:47:58.386]  And we have to put our foot down.
[01:47:58.386 --> 01:48:10.610]  And whatever it takes to do that, whether it's bringing lawsuits against the NSA, or bringing lawsuits, bracketing lawsuits against Hillary Clinton for selling waivers to Iran in exchange for contributions to the Clinton Foundation.
[01:48:10.610 --> 01:48:13.651]  I have a case down in Southern District of Florida right now.
[01:48:13.651 --> 01:48:25.576]  I'm no constitutional lawyer, but being in the State Department, taking money from foreign states to then unblock weapons transfers, to ship weapons, I mean, that sounds like a James Bond villain.
[01:48:27.560 --> 01:48:28.701]  It does.
[01:48:28.701 --> 01:48:32.844]  And challenging him on immigration.
[01:48:32.844 --> 01:48:37.187]  I have a case for Sheriff Joe Arpaio and his executive orders.
[01:48:37.187 --> 01:48:38.528]  It's in the District of Columbia.
[01:48:38.528 --> 01:48:42.632]  We also intervened in the Texas case by filing amicus briefs.
[01:48:42.632 --> 01:48:43.652]  We have to cover the waterfront.
[01:48:43.652 --> 01:48:45.854]  We have to use whatever tools we have.
[01:48:45.854 --> 01:48:53.620]  Because with this power of these intelligence agencies to intercept our telephone messages, our email communications, our social media contacts,
[01:48:54.306 --> 01:49:06.154]  Our founding fathers, if they had lived under this, in 1776, if George III, I'm not talking about Bush, I'm talking about King George III, had had these powers, they wouldn't have made it to Philadelphia.
[01:49:06.154 --> 01:49:09.376]  They would have been picked up, arrested, and executed before they got there.
[01:49:09.376 --> 01:49:14.260]  So it's almost impossible to wage a revolution today like our founding fathers did.
[01:49:14.260 --> 01:49:16.381]  We have to use whatever means we can.
[01:49:16.381 --> 01:49:23.526]  Peaceful nonviolence, a la Martin Luther King, a la Nelson Mandela, a la Lech Walesa in Poland.
[01:49:24.190 --> 01:49:27.451]  And use our legal system in hopes that we find those good judges.
[01:49:27.451 --> 01:49:27.851]  Sure.
[01:49:27.851 --> 01:49:29.012]  Who will put their foot forward.
[01:49:29.012 --> 01:49:35.374]  That's what we... Well, you're involved in so many trailblazing things, but let's get into two members of Supreme Court targeted by U.S.
[01:49:35.374 --> 01:49:36.094]  spies.
[01:49:36.094 --> 01:49:38.935]  Tell us about that, Larry Klaman.
[01:49:38.935 --> 01:49:40.456]  We don't know much about that.
[01:49:40.456 --> 01:49:45.677]  All we know is that the intelligence agencies have been getting into their records.
[01:49:45.677 --> 01:49:49.779]  I don't know for a fact whether they've been blackmailed or not, but the potential is there.
[01:49:49.779 --> 01:49:50.379]  And when you see
[01:49:51.329 --> 01:49:59.351]  Uh, the decision at the end of the Obamacare analysis a few years back, where the Chief Justice all of a sudden flipped at the end.
[01:49:59.351 --> 01:50:02.292]  And in fact, his decision was incomprehensible.
[01:50:02.292 --> 01:50:05.713]  First, he says, it isn't a tax, the Obamacare.
[01:50:05.713 --> 01:50:10.935]  Uh, and then he says it is, and he sustains it as Congress's power to tax.
[01:50:10.935 --> 01:50:13.516]  You have to really wonder what's going on.
[01:50:13.516 --> 01:50:17.917]  And that's why it's good to expose these things because, you know, fundamentally,
[01:50:18.799 --> 01:50:19.580]  The Chief Justice.
[01:50:19.580 --> 01:50:21.701]  I hope this time he rules differently.
[01:50:21.701 --> 01:50:23.803]  But he has not played it straight.
[01:50:23.803 --> 01:50:27.026]  And that destroys confidence in our court system.
[01:50:27.026 --> 01:50:27.966]  It sure did!
[01:50:27.966 --> 01:50:31.009]  I mean, anybody knows Obamacare is not constitutional.
[01:50:31.009 --> 01:50:33.330]  It's not enforced universally.
[01:50:33.330 --> 01:50:34.451]  The whole thing's a fraud.
[01:50:34.451 --> 01:50:35.692]  They change it all the time.
[01:50:35.692 --> 01:50:38.955]  I mean, it's just a monstrosity.
[01:50:38.955 --> 01:50:40.256]  Absolutely.
[01:50:40.256 --> 01:50:43.918]  And, you know, a number of other decisions coming out of the courts.
[01:50:45.003 --> 01:50:47.324]  You know, sustaining things that just simply are not sustainable.
[01:50:47.324 --> 01:50:50.325]  Whether you're for gay marriage or not, it's the right of the state.
[01:50:50.325 --> 01:50:53.227]  And we're going to see what comes out of the Supreme Court on that one, too.
[01:50:53.227 --> 01:50:54.827]  That's a highly volatile decision.
[01:50:54.827 --> 01:50:58.749]  That should be made on the state level, whether you agree with it or not.
[01:50:58.749 --> 01:51:00.910]  Immigration law.
[01:51:00.910 --> 01:51:06.052]  The President said he's not an emperor, yet he puts it into effect.
[01:51:06.052 --> 01:51:08.053]  Our Congress cowers away and does nothing.
[01:51:08.661 --> 01:51:12.543]  Our Congress should be submitting articles of impeachment right now to get this guy out of there.
[01:51:12.543 --> 01:51:16.985]  But no, they're playing games because they're hoping that maybe they'll win the next presidential election.
[01:51:16.985 --> 01:51:21.086]  But by that time, Alex, 18 months down the line, our country could be destroyed.
[01:51:21.086 --> 01:51:23.487]  I mean, we're already on the ropes.
[01:51:23.487 --> 01:51:26.008]  We're already close to election.
[01:51:26.008 --> 01:51:27.489]  So what are we going to do?
[01:51:27.489 --> 01:51:30.931]  And that's the question that you pose and I pose.
[01:51:30.931 --> 01:51:34.052]  And I'm doing what I can in the courts, but the American people need to rise up.
[01:51:34.679 --> 01:51:36.920]  And they need to tell their representatives, ship up or ship out.
[01:51:36.920 --> 01:51:39.202]  Well, they need to support freedomwatchusa.org.
[01:51:39.202 --> 01:51:42.204]  I know you can come on to ask for donations or support.
[01:51:42.204 --> 01:51:43.805]  Folks, better pray for you.
[01:51:43.805 --> 01:51:46.126]  No one is more aggressive and bold.
[01:51:46.126 --> 01:51:50.069]  Probably 60% of the good lawsuits out there are coming from you.
[01:51:50.069 --> 01:51:52.650]  We used to have Greg Abbott, before he was governor, suing the feds.
[01:51:52.650 --> 01:51:53.551]  He's still doing it.
[01:51:53.551 --> 01:51:54.992]  He's good.
[01:51:54.992 --> 01:51:57.033]  But man, we need to fight this any way we can.
[01:51:57.033 --> 01:51:57.714]  Larry Klayman.
[01:51:58.514 --> 01:52:01.956]  Freedomwatchusa.org is our guest.
[01:52:01.956 --> 01:52:07.519]  I want to come back and ask him what else he's looking at, what concerns him most, and any positive news he's got for us.
[01:52:07.519 --> 01:52:11.121]  But the most positive thing is at least we know we're in deep trouble.
[01:52:11.121 --> 01:52:12.741]  We're not asleep.
[01:52:12.741 --> 01:52:14.362]  So we're not here trying to scare you folks.
[01:52:14.362 --> 01:52:16.944]  We're here telling you the house is on fire.
[01:52:16.944 --> 01:52:19.305]  We have some really deviant people running the country right now.
[01:52:33.174 --> 01:52:36.776]  Stingray, Stingray.
[01:52:36.776 --> 01:52:46.922]  Speaking of Stingray... Larry Klayman went to federal court, won against the NSA, one of the major cases out there.
[01:52:46.922 --> 01:52:49.443]  The media really hated that a few years ago.
[01:52:49.443 --> 01:52:51.864]  And now he's moving forward with other cases.
[01:52:51.864 --> 01:52:53.845]  In the five, six minutes we've got left, Mr. Klayman,
[01:52:57.381 --> 01:52:58.982]  What's the good news, A?
[01:52:58.982 --> 01:53:01.183]  B, what else are you most concerned about right now?
[01:53:01.183 --> 01:53:09.308]  Tell us about some of the other actions you're involved in.
[01:53:09.308 --> 01:53:10.649]  We may have lost his audio.
[01:53:10.649 --> 01:53:14.511]  We've had some issues with the board today.
[01:53:14.511 --> 01:53:19.754]  So, we'll figure out what's happening with that audio and try to get him back up here in just a moment.
[01:53:21.252 --> 01:53:26.754]  Speaking of tyranny, this article really makes my head spin.
[01:53:26.754 --> 01:53:31.695]  11-year-old boy kidnapped by CPS.
[01:53:31.695 --> 01:53:44.200]  Parents arrested after he played in backyard alone for 90 minutes.
[01:53:44.200 --> 01:53:47.961]  A couple in Florida were arrested and charged with felony neglect
[01:53:49.016 --> 01:53:55.722]  After their 11-year-old son was left alone in the backyard playing basketball for 90 minutes.
[01:53:55.722 --> 01:53:58.204]  He ought to be given a medal that he wasn't playing video games.
[01:53:58.204 --> 01:54:02.327]  Furthermore, the child was taken from the parents and placed into foster care.
[01:54:02.327 --> 01:54:09.654]  The remarkable story was related to the website Free Range Kids, which advocates raising children to be self-reliant.
[01:54:09.654 --> 01:54:11.155]  Yeah, we ought to get that lady back on.
[01:54:11.155 --> 01:54:16.540]  Rather than succumbing to the nanny state, I guess, TV coffins that they place people in now.
[01:54:18.278 --> 01:54:21.520]  First it was seven-year-olds and eight-year-olds and nine-year-olds and ten-year-olds.
[01:54:21.520 --> 01:54:26.804]  I mean, eleven-year-old in their backyard!
[01:54:26.804 --> 01:54:39.613]  I mean, when I was eleven, I would walk, sometimes if my parents weren't home or weren't giving me a ride, five miles to a pool party.
[01:54:39.613 --> 01:54:41.314]  You know, there were cheerleaders there.
[01:54:41.314 --> 01:54:42.535]  Literally.
[01:54:42.535 --> 01:54:43.476]  Or whatever.
[01:54:43.476 --> 01:54:44.497]  And then somebody gave me a ride back.
[01:54:45.780 --> 01:54:56.207]  And sometimes I couldn't get a ride back, and I remember I'd walk, because there was a railroad track that would run right into town that was quicker than taking the roads, and I could walk into a whole bunch of the neighborhoods that were there.
[01:54:56.207 --> 01:55:06.695]  I mean, I'd walk sometimes six, seven miles, and then I'd be like 12, 13 years old, and then I'd call back from whoever's house I was at, and I'd say,
[01:55:08.156 --> 01:55:09.638]  Dad, you want to come pick me up?"
[01:55:09.638 --> 01:55:10.819]  And he'd usually say, yeah, sure.
[01:55:10.819 --> 01:55:13.742]  Sometimes he'd say, hey, I told you, I'm at a business meeting and your mom's out of town.
[01:55:13.742 --> 01:55:15.603]  You're going to have to just walk back.
[01:55:15.603 --> 01:55:19.187]  I remember walking back sometimes, it'd be, you know, 10 at night by the time I got home.
[01:55:19.187 --> 01:55:20.268]  It was awesome.
[01:55:20.268 --> 01:55:22.690]  Railroad tracks at night, owls flying by.
[01:55:22.690 --> 01:55:25.913]  Because we lived out on the edge of Dallas, so it was like countryside.
[01:55:25.913 --> 01:55:30.437]  Now it's all skyscrapers where I grew up, or big buildings, but it was countryside part of it.
[01:55:33.342 --> 01:55:48.232]  I mean, that was normal for my dad because he used to get sent places to work during the summer, an apprentice at oil refinery, steel mill, different things just to have the experience.
[01:55:48.232 --> 01:55:49.994]  He wasn't child labor.
[01:55:49.994 --> 01:55:54.737]  They would just send him to get different experiences so that he wouldn't be a moron.
[01:55:54.737 --> 01:56:01.962]  But instead now, oh, keep your children inside watching television all day, and if they go in the backyard and play basketball, we're going to take them.
[01:56:05.117 --> 01:56:09.579]  The boy found himself locked out of the family home in April after his parents became stuck in traffic.
[01:56:09.579 --> 01:56:11.220]  Boy, does that happen all the time.
[01:56:11.220 --> 01:56:17.243]  A busy-bodied neighbor decided that this was far too dangerous and called the cops.
[01:56:17.243 --> 01:56:24.106]  When the parents arrived home, they were put in handcuffs, strip-searched, fingerprinted, and subsequently held overnight in jail.
[01:56:24.106 --> 01:56:32.830]  Meanwhile, the boy and his four-year-old brother, who was not left alone at the time, were taken into the custody of police and handed to a relative.
[01:56:33.530 --> 01:56:41.218]  It emerged that for 48 hours while the handover was being sorted out, the children were only fed cereal and were not encouraged to wash.
[01:56:41.218 --> 01:56:41.819]  Well, of course.
[01:56:41.819 --> 01:56:42.360]  It's the government.
[01:56:42.360 --> 01:56:43.601]  Why should they have to do anything?
[01:56:43.601 --> 01:56:54.193]  After a few weeks of not being able to see their kids, the couple discovered that the relative was caring for them, had enough, and was handing the children over to CPS, whose lawyers asked the judge to place the children in foster care.
[01:56:54.673 --> 01:57:01.418]  When the parents came to court, there was a back-and-forth arrangement between CPS and the lawyer and the family's legal representative that went on for hours.
[01:57:01.418 --> 01:57:05.822]  It was only after 11-year-old boys spoke to the judge that sanity prevailed.
[01:57:05.822 --> 01:57:10.826]  He went back there, spoke to the judge for about 10 minutes, and the mother told free-range kids.
[01:57:10.826 --> 01:57:15.649]  And then the judge came out and called the two lawyers to the bench and talked to them for about 10 or 15 minutes.
[01:57:17.188 --> 01:57:34.624]  And after that, our lawyer came to us and said, if we admitted that we didn't know that it was wrong for our son to stay in the backyard, but that we would know that it's wrong and we'll never let it happen again, that we will explain this to our son, he would let the children come with us.
[01:57:34.624 --> 01:57:41.250]  The parents agreed to the terms, so the system wouldn't feel guilty, and were allowed to take their children home a month after the incident originally occurred.
[01:57:42.836 --> 01:57:45.045]  And they're now taking parenting classes.
[01:57:45.045 --> 01:57:48.598]  I mean, I can't tell you how many times... that...
[01:57:51.138 --> 01:57:55.899]  My parents were supposed to pick me up somewhere and got in traffic or had a problem and were 30 minutes an hour late.
[01:57:55.899 --> 01:57:57.980]  I mean, whoop-dee-doo.
[01:57:57.980 --> 01:58:01.721]  That's why we're raising a bunch of jellyfish that don't know what planet they're on.
[01:58:01.721 --> 01:58:03.761]  Because they don't know anything.
[01:58:03.761 --> 01:58:07.542]  I mean, there was a convenience store a mile and a half from the house.
[01:58:07.542 --> 01:58:10.203]  My mother had me walk there every week to get her something.
[01:58:10.203 --> 01:58:11.584]  We're on the march.
[01:58:11.584 --> 01:58:13.104]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:58:13.104 --> 01:58:14.184]  I needed to be out of the house.
[01:58:14.184 --> 01:58:15.785]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:20.407 --> 01:58:24.229]  Sauron began much of his former strength.
[01:58:24.229 --> 01:58:29.792]  He cannot yet take physical form, but his spirit has lost none of its potency.
[01:58:29.792 --> 01:58:35.055]  Concealed within his fortress, the Lord of Mordor sees all.
[01:58:35.055 --> 01:58:42.379]  His gaze pierces cloud, shadow, earth, and flesh.
[01:58:42.379 --> 01:58:44.780]  You know of what I speak, Gandalf.
[01:58:46.309 --> 01:58:50.950]  A great eye, lidless, wreathed in flame.
[01:58:50.950 --> 01:58:54.151]  I have sorrow.
[01:58:54.151 --> 01:58:56.712]  He is gathering all evil to him.
[01:58:56.712 --> 01:59:01.874]  Very soon he will have summoned an army great enough to launch an assault upon Middle-Earth.
[01:59:01.874 --> 01:59:04.674]  You know this?
[01:59:04.674 --> 01:59:06.795]  How?
[01:59:06.795 --> 01:59:08.636]  I have seen it.
[01:59:08.636 --> 01:59:12.357]  A Palantir is a dangerous tool, Saruman.
[01:59:12.357 --> 01:59:12.657]  Why?
[01:59:14.211 --> 01:59:19.377]  Why should we fear to use it?
[01:59:19.377 --> 01:59:21.080]  They are not all accounted for.
[01:59:21.080 --> 01:59:23.282]  Velocity exclaims.
[01:59:23.282 --> 01:59:28.889]  We do not know who else may be watching.
[01:59:28.889 --> 01:59:31.432]  The hour is later than you think.
[01:59:31.432 --> 01:59:33.114]  Sauron's forces are already present.
[01:59:36.081 --> 01:59:39.723]  The Nine have left Minas Mormon.
[01:59:39.723 --> 01:59:42.025]  And our T.P.D.
[01:59:42.025 --> 01:59:43.366]  is prepared.
[01:59:43.366 --> 01:59:46.148]  Disguised as riders in black.
[01:59:46.148 --> 01:59:47.448]  They've reached the sun.
[01:59:47.448 --> 01:59:51.551]  They will find the ring.
[01:59:51.551 --> 01:59:54.673]  And kill the one who carries it.
[01:59:54.673 --> 02:00:03.559]  We must join the New World Order.
[02:00:06.792 --> 02:00:07.752]  Take your shots!
[02:00:07.752 --> 02:00:12.513]  It is not serious a thing that a hobbit could contend with the will of Sauron.
[02:00:12.513 --> 02:00:16.014]  There are none who can.
[02:00:16.014 --> 02:00:24.935]  Against the power of mortal, there can be no victory.
[02:00:24.935 --> 02:00:29.096]  We must join with him, Gandalf.
[02:00:29.096 --> 02:00:33.637]  We must join with Sauron.
[02:00:33.637 --> 02:00:35.617]  It would be wise, my friend,
[02:00:40.407 --> 02:00:44.396]  When did Saruman the Wise abandon reason for madness?
[02:01:22.930 --> 02:01:31.861]  I gave you the chance of beating me, willingly, but you have elected the way of pigs!
[02:01:50.541 --> 02:01:56.843]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[02:01:56.843 --> 02:02:02.165]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:02:02.165 --> 02:02:12.928]  It was Christopher Lee that changed our image of Count Dracula from the German Nosferatu to the now classical Dracula in the tuxedo.
[02:02:14.451 --> 02:02:17.353]  He was in over 400 films, one of my favorite actors.
[02:02:17.353 --> 02:02:20.216]  Even though he'd be in a B-movie, I had to watch it because he was in it.
[02:02:20.216 --> 02:02:21.777]  Incredible presence.
[02:02:21.777 --> 02:02:26.401]  And I kept seeing him in big movies, Count Dooku, you name it, and the new Star Wars.
[02:02:26.401 --> 02:02:29.403]  I was like, man, how does this guy just keep going?
[02:02:29.403 --> 02:02:31.105]  And going, and going, and going.
[02:02:31.105 --> 02:02:32.606]  Well, he's dead.
[02:02:32.606 --> 02:02:33.207]  And you know what?
[02:02:33.207 --> 02:02:38.451]  We don't get into entertainment news, but we like to celebrate interesting people.
[02:02:38.451 --> 02:02:39.372]  And he's dead at age 93.
[02:02:41.445 --> 02:02:56.941]  Christopher Lee, an actor of muscular intelligence with a staggering career, the Guardian writes, from his electrifying roles as Count Dracula to his venerable turn in Lord of the Rings and Star Wars, Christopher Lee possessed a rare grace and charm.
[02:02:57.822 --> 02:03:00.583]  Yeah, the globalists say humans are ugly and bad and failed.
[02:03:00.583 --> 02:03:01.843]  It's pure bull.
[02:03:01.843 --> 02:03:07.865]  Humans are amazing, and we celebrate humans that have gotten us to think and given us joy.
[02:03:07.865 --> 02:03:10.206]  And so, Bon Voyage, Christopher Lee.
[02:03:10.206 --> 02:03:11.647]  There you go.
[02:03:11.647 --> 02:03:15.488]  All these other globalists that think they're going to hang on to life forever, everybody dies.
[02:03:15.488 --> 02:03:18.329]  The good, the bad, and the ugly.
[02:03:18.329 --> 02:03:21.250]  Remember that.
[02:03:21.250 --> 02:03:23.751]  Yeah, James Bond villains, you name it.
[02:03:23.751 --> 02:03:26.252]  But I think that's one of his best roles as a sorrowman.
[02:03:27.284 --> 02:03:31.007]  Man, I tell you, that first Lord of the Rings is such an excellent movie cinematically.
[02:03:31.007 --> 02:03:32.588]  It's done so well.
[02:03:32.588 --> 02:03:37.071]  And the new ones are just video game trash.
[02:03:37.071 --> 02:03:42.174]  I took my son to see the last one and it was World of Warcraft computer program.
[02:03:42.174 --> 02:03:42.734]  You could see
[02:03:43.715 --> 02:03:50.838]  The, the cuts in the arms, because they're like movable dolls, basically, in a computer program.
[02:03:50.838 --> 02:03:53.940]  You can see the segmented arms and legs in the battles.
[02:03:53.940 --> 02:03:59.402]  I mean, but that's because the public accepts it, and those movies make even more money.
[02:03:59.402 --> 02:04:08.647]  The new Marvel comic movie I went to see just to analyze it, The Avengers, the worst thing I've ever seen.
[02:04:09.611 --> 02:04:13.494]  I mean, just, they don't even try to make it good.
[02:04:13.494 --> 02:04:15.296]  It is just walls of crud.
[02:04:15.296 --> 02:04:23.742]  And I'm told that's what they've done with the new movie that's coming out, Jurassic Park.
[02:04:23.742 --> 02:04:25.624]  So, that's what's sick about it.
[02:04:28.717 --> 02:04:35.060]  Captain America had a really good message, it was really good, it was fantastical but not unbelievable.
[02:04:35.060 --> 02:04:47.965]  Now I was watching, because they had like a 10 minute thing at the beginning of another film, I went to see with a sneak peek from Marvel of what's coming up, where they admitted, they had like the head of Marvel up there talking, the head of their film division,
[02:04:49.790 --> 02:05:05.298]  Talking about how people want these new, more exciting CG films, so, you know, the next Captain America will be like that too, and it's just like, oh my gosh, you know, I like fantasy as much as the next person, but man, unwatchable!
[02:05:05.298 --> 02:05:15.823]  I've seen online, on YouTube, some of these channels have billions of views, where people go and they play video games, and that's more interesting to watch somebody play video games
[02:05:18.260 --> 02:05:23.084]  I don't really do that, but I've looked at it to understand culture, than The Last Lord of the Rings.
[02:05:23.084 --> 02:05:33.451]  I mean, I was watching them lazily, basically with a pre-programmed video game, play a video game.
[02:05:33.451 --> 02:05:36.854]  I mean, the dragon in The Desolation of Smaug was still pretty good.
[02:05:36.854 --> 02:05:37.875]  It was still kind of cartoonish.
[02:05:37.875 --> 02:05:40.176]  You know, they just get worse and worse as they go.
[02:05:40.176 --> 02:05:43.459]  But by the next one, the dragon looks like a Tinker Toy or something.
[02:05:44.116 --> 02:05:52.240]  They just don't care, because the public's so dumbed down, it's going to be like television and idiocracy soon.
[02:05:52.240 --> 02:06:02.264]  Where your easy chair is the toilet, and you just sit there all day watching someone be kicked in the groin area over and over again.
[02:06:02.264 --> 02:06:04.905]  Or people falling, or people getting hurt.
[02:06:04.905 --> 02:06:06.506]  I mean, that's all it is.
[02:06:06.506 --> 02:06:10.307]  It's just the most mindless trash you could ever see.
[02:06:10.307 --> 02:06:11.848]  I mean, you could see a movie like The Godfather.
[02:06:13.311 --> 02:06:15.031]  One or two, but especially one.
[02:06:15.031 --> 02:06:17.872]  And it's like you're there in that house.
[02:06:17.872 --> 02:06:22.633]  The lighting, the actors, it's so well done.
[02:06:22.633 --> 02:06:24.314]  It takes you there.
[02:06:24.314 --> 02:06:28.295]  And you've got something the polar opposite of that now, is what cinema's become.
[02:06:28.295 --> 02:06:33.696]  And it isn't me, some old guy who's 41, who can't handle the new cool stuff.
[02:06:33.696 --> 02:06:36.517]  Everyone admits they're dumbing the culture down on purpose.
[02:06:45.680 --> 02:06:52.084]  Peter Cushing's another amazing actor.
[02:06:52.084 --> 02:06:58.807]  Evacuate, and I'm Moments of Triumph.
[02:06:58.807 --> 02:07:01.869]  I saw some movie when I was on the elliptical months ago.
[02:07:01.869 --> 02:07:05.371]  Guilty of the House, I'm the one at the gym.
[02:07:05.371 --> 02:07:11.074]  Where it's like, uh... Yeti Bigfoot in Nepal.
[02:07:12.708 --> 02:07:14.349]  And, you know, it's really cheesy B-movie.
[02:07:14.349 --> 02:07:15.170]  It looks like it's from like 1950.
[02:07:15.170 --> 02:07:22.736]  I forget the name of the movie, but just because it had Peter in it, you couldn't stop watching it.
[02:07:22.736 --> 02:07:25.278]  He just was such an interesting person.
[02:07:25.278 --> 02:07:27.379]  Where are those actors today?
[02:07:27.379 --> 02:07:31.803]  I mean, it's just, it's just, it's embarrassing.
[02:07:31.803 --> 02:07:38.328]  And then even though they're a decent actor, they usually have some horrible, you know, obsession with taking my guns when they have bodyguards.
[02:07:38.328 --> 02:07:40.770]  I mean, they're just, you know, Piers Morgan.
[02:07:43.803 --> 02:07:47.105]  Has armed bodyguards at his house.
[02:07:47.105 --> 02:07:47.806]  He admits it.
[02:07:47.806 --> 02:07:48.946]  But I can't have guns.
[02:07:48.946 --> 02:07:52.468]  I mean, it's... But see, he deserves to have armed bodyguards.
[02:07:52.468 --> 02:07:53.409]  I don't.
[02:07:53.409 --> 02:07:55.110]  See, I can't afford armed bodyguards.
[02:07:55.110 --> 02:07:56.811]  I mean, I guess I could.
[02:07:56.811 --> 02:08:00.573]  Wouldn't be in the budget to send three reporters to Switzerland.
[02:08:00.573 --> 02:08:01.814]  Or to Austria.
[02:08:01.814 --> 02:08:02.575]  Or to Greece.
[02:08:04.804 --> 02:08:05.544]  But I'm digressing.
[02:08:05.544 --> 02:08:07.385]  I've got two special reports I want to play.
[02:08:07.385 --> 02:08:10.526]  Speaking of money, we fund ourselves with high quality products.
[02:08:10.526 --> 02:08:16.708]  The best pro-liberty t-shirts, ball caps, belt buckles, hold made in America section.
[02:08:16.708 --> 02:08:20.389]  The Nutraceuticals, 20% off, pro-pure pitchers, best deal out there.
[02:08:20.389 --> 02:08:28.552]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[02:08:28.552 --> 02:08:34.154]  Got the new upside-down American flag with the flag coat under it saying, Save the Republic.
[02:08:36.803 --> 02:08:43.487]  And then it says on the back, our Republic is in distress, ask me why, InfoWars.com.
[02:08:43.487 --> 02:08:46.509]  We have those shirts, that's the newest shirt.
[02:08:46.509 --> 02:08:50.471]  I came up with the concept, so I get all the blame, but it's very popular.
[02:08:50.471 --> 02:08:51.832]  It's a great way to wake folks up.
[02:08:51.832 --> 02:08:55.675]  InfoWars, Life.com, InfoWarsStore.com, or 888-253-3139.
[02:08:55.675 --> 02:08:58.597]  And then of course there's PrisonPlanet.tv, one membership,
[02:09:03.112 --> 02:09:04.793]  is really 20 memberships.
[02:09:04.793 --> 02:09:06.755]  20 people can use each username and passcode.
[02:09:06.755 --> 02:09:08.636]  Please keep sharing those with friends and family.
[02:09:08.636 --> 02:09:11.038]  More and more folks are watching every day and we're waking them up.
[02:09:11.038 --> 02:09:20.245]  There's also the free streams of the daytime show at InfoWars.com forward slash show, but the folks that are PrisonPlanet.tv members really help finance so much of what we're doing.
[02:09:20.245 --> 02:09:26.349]  I told you last week that Survival Shield Nascent Iodine X2, or about two weeks ago, was set to sell out.
[02:09:26.349 --> 02:09:28.831]  It did sell out.
[02:09:28.831 --> 02:09:32.214]  We were manufacturing more at the facility, the laboratory,
[02:09:33.692 --> 02:09:36.372]  It got shipped in today.
[02:09:36.372 --> 02:09:40.553]  And it is a very small run.
[02:09:40.553 --> 02:09:46.134]  And then we are scrambling to try to secure and jump through all the hoops because we can get it.
[02:09:46.134 --> 02:09:50.295]  You just have to then go through regulatory hoops to have it transferred to you each time.
[02:09:50.295 --> 02:09:56.676]  That's why I told Group this time, the next time we secure some, I want to get a ton of it, like a three-year supply.
[02:09:56.676 --> 02:10:01.417]  Because we got this two years ago, or almost two years ago, and are just now running out.
[02:10:01.417 --> 02:10:02.937]  I'm like, why didn't we order a bunch more?
[02:10:04.198 --> 02:10:07.144]  I mean, we could be three, four months, six months, maybe?
[02:10:07.144 --> 02:10:09.409]  I'm not mad at anybody.
[02:10:09.409 --> 02:10:11.494]  It's just that this is one of our best-selling items.
[02:10:11.494 --> 02:10:12.276]  I love it.
[02:10:12.276 --> 02:10:13.658]  I use it.
[02:10:13.658 --> 02:10:14.280]  It's amazing.
[02:10:15.552 --> 02:10:19.093]  InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:10:19.093 --> 02:10:21.013]  A limited run is down here if you want it.
[02:10:21.013 --> 02:10:22.654]  I want to share it with your friends and family.
[02:10:22.654 --> 02:10:31.235]  Consult a physician because when you've been deficient in iodine and your thyroid's full of all the bad allergens, it can be pretty dramatic, the changes.
[02:10:31.235 --> 02:10:32.616]  What I had happen was amazing.
[02:10:32.616 --> 02:10:34.076]  Energy, weight loss, whole nine yards.
[02:10:34.076 --> 02:10:35.196]  You've read the reviews.
[02:10:35.196 --> 02:10:36.537]  InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:10:36.537 --> 02:10:37.577]  But this is serious stuff.
[02:10:38.467 --> 02:10:40.208]  Unlike any other iodine out there.
[02:10:40.208 --> 02:10:44.610]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139 if you want it.
[02:10:44.610 --> 02:10:47.251]  Now's the time to get it.
[02:10:47.251 --> 02:10:53.815]  It'll probably sell out in a week at the rate it's there and we'll still have the original survival shield and it's excellent as well.
[02:10:55.791 --> 02:10:59.112]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:10:59.112 --> 02:11:08.134]  I have several special reports here, one by John Bowne and then one by Leanne McAdoo that I wanted to get to.
[02:11:08.134 --> 02:11:13.875]  Here is John Bowne's latest excellent report.
[02:11:13.875 --> 02:11:16.136]  And then we will come back after the break.
[02:11:34.175 --> 02:11:43.217]  People don't remember, when I came into office, the United States, in world opinion, ranked below China, and just barely above Russia.
[02:11:43.217 --> 02:11:47.118]  And today, once again, the United States is the most respected country on Earth.
[02:11:48.543 --> 02:12:00.208]  And part of that, I think, is because of the work that we did to re-engage the world and say that we want to work with you as partners with mutual interest and mutual respect.
[02:12:00.208 --> 02:12:01.468]  He's just wrong.
[02:12:01.468 --> 02:12:03.409]  Flat wrong and delusional.
[02:12:03.409 --> 02:12:08.671]  Which appears to have become the norm for US presidents since Richard Nixon completely transformed the office.
[02:12:08.871 --> 02:12:09.351]  We're good to go.
[02:12:27.119 --> 02:12:39.946]  Obama's aides probably shredded the 2014 BBC poll showing that the US is 7th in mainly negative ratings under China, Russia, Israel, Pakistan, North Korea and Iran at number 1.
[02:12:39.946 --> 02:12:43.909]  Maybe Obama is confusing corporate leaders with world leaders.
[02:12:43.909 --> 02:12:49.692]  He recently made the Brazilian and German leaders furious when it was revealed that they had been personally spied on.
[02:12:50.531 --> 02:12:56.174]  I have made it clear to the President of the United States that spying on friends is not acceptable at all.
[02:12:56.174 --> 02:13:00.716]  I said that when he was in Berlin in July and also yesterday in a telephone call.
[02:13:00.716 --> 02:13:03.618]  It's not just about me, but about every German citizen.
[02:13:04.582 --> 02:13:11.506]  Citizens' personal data and information have been indiscriminately targeted and intercepted.
[02:13:11.506 --> 02:13:20.212]  Business information, oftentimes of high economic and even strategic value, have been the target of spying activity.
[02:13:20.212 --> 02:13:32.680]  We're able to end two wars while still focusing on the very real threat of terrorism and to try to work with our partners on the ground in places like Iraq and Afghanistan.
[02:13:33.325 --> 02:13:36.226]  What do you make of even Bloomberg reporting that basically the U.S.
[02:13:36.226 --> 02:13:38.727]  is working with Al-Qaeda to take over Iraq?
[02:13:38.727 --> 02:13:39.807]  I mean, this is insane.
[02:13:39.807 --> 02:13:41.528]  And take over areas of Syria.
[02:13:41.528 --> 02:13:42.348]  No, it's clear.
[02:13:42.348 --> 02:13:54.152]  This whole operation was to, it started with getting rid of Saddam, and then Qaddafi in Libya, and now Assad in Syria, at Yemen, now a mess, a civil war.
[02:13:54.152 --> 02:14:00.655]  All those governments were secular, and now we run the risk of them being replaced by these Salafists.
[02:14:01.355 --> 02:14:02.115]  I think so.
[02:14:22.404 --> 02:14:23.685]  I mean, give me a break, man.
[02:14:23.685 --> 02:14:28.087]  Our government's funding people that sexually mutilate women and make them wear gloves?
[02:14:28.087 --> 02:14:29.648]  I mean, I'm just, I'm done!
[02:14:29.648 --> 02:14:31.709]  I'm done with the scum that runs our government.
[02:14:31.709 --> 02:14:37.212]  Was the airdrop of weapons and supplies to ISIS really a mistake?
[02:14:37.212 --> 02:14:47.278]  After all, it's always been the ultimate goal of the United States and its allies to put boots on the ground in Syria and to remove al-Assad from power.
[02:14:48.118 --> 02:14:53.440]  The mistaken airdrop could be used as an excuse to send in U.S.
[02:14:53.440 --> 02:14:54.980]  ground forces.
[02:14:54.980 --> 02:14:56.201]  But wait a minute!
[02:14:56.201 --> 02:14:57.721]  Why on earth would the U.S.
[02:14:57.721 --> 02:15:01.622]  government purposely give ISIS terrorists weapons?
[02:15:01.622 --> 02:15:09.305]  I mean, these are the same Muslim extremists who are going around beheading journalists and executing Christians right now!
[02:15:09.305 --> 02:15:10.845]  Do you mean to tell me the U.S.
[02:15:10.845 --> 02:15:15.607]  government is so corrupt that they're so evil that they would actually do something like that?
[02:15:17.070 --> 02:15:18.811]  Yes, yes they would.
[02:15:18.811 --> 02:15:21.693]  And the evidence is overwhelming.
[02:15:21.693 --> 02:15:31.058]  In fact, the pallet of weapons that has supposedly ended up in the wrong hands, what's really insignificant compared to the total ISIS arsenal.
[02:15:31.058 --> 02:15:46.367]  Not only does ISIS have in their possession tons of weaponry taken from the retreating Iraqi forces, but the terrorist army now has long-range artillery and thousands of automatic weapons, courtesy of the good old
[02:15:46.687 --> 02:15:47.708]  USA.
[02:15:47.708 --> 02:15:52.793]  Here's John McCain standing next to a known... That's right, standing with the leaders.
[02:15:52.793 --> 02:15:53.674]  It's a longer report.
[02:15:53.674 --> 02:15:55.055]  There's about six minutes left.
[02:15:55.055 --> 02:15:57.157]  It's the delusions of King Obama.
[02:15:57.157 --> 02:15:59.499]  We're going to repost it to Infowars.com.
[02:15:59.499 --> 02:16:03.022]  And we're going to tweet it out.
[02:16:03.962 --> 02:16:06.746]  At Real Alex Jones, you want to see the full report.
[02:16:06.746 --> 02:16:11.554]  And when we come back, we're going to hit some other top stories I've not gotten to yet.
[02:16:11.554 --> 02:16:13.216]  I don't know if we'll have time to do Leanne's report.
[02:16:13.216 --> 02:16:15.620]  I wanted to, but it was on the nightly news last night.
[02:16:15.620 --> 02:16:16.301]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:16:16.301 --> 02:16:16.822]  Please stay with us.
[02:16:29.252 --> 02:16:32.834]  I want to play Leanne McAdoo's report on laser weapons in the U.S.
[02:16:32.834 --> 02:16:42.798]  military, and I want to get to an excellent report Kit Daniels did in Overdrive dealing with the Bilderberg cooking up the oil crisis that Jim Tucker documented, so we'll do that.
[02:16:42.798 --> 02:16:53.082]  I have one other piece of news we'll hit in the next segment, but here is Leanne McAdoo's report, then Homeland Security secretly videotaping citizens to predict pre-crime.
[02:16:54.221 --> 02:17:02.527]  Not being satisfied with laser weapons that are both invisible and silent, companies like Boeing have announced that they're going to be taking their laser weapons to the next level.
[02:17:04.022 --> 02:17:11.504]  Previously, operators have had to pay close attention to know exactly when they've been firing these silent but deadly weapons.
[02:17:11.504 --> 02:17:16.665]  Now, their lasers will be equipped with Star Trek and Star Wars sound effects.
[02:17:16.665 --> 02:17:25.368]  So next time Boeing's high-energy laser mobile demonstrator shoots down a drone mid-flight, it's gonna sound exactly like Han Solo's blaster.
[02:17:26.345 --> 02:17:29.226]  But that isn't all that science fiction has influenced.
[02:17:29.226 --> 02:17:39.209]  In addition to cell phones and ion propulsion and handheld devices, Star Trek and Star Wars have also influenced futurists like Ray Kurzweil.
[02:17:39.209 --> 02:17:44.571]  Kurzweil is once again repeating his prediction that humans will meld with computers in the future.
[02:17:44.571 --> 02:17:50.433]  But instead of 2045, Kurzweil is now suggesting cyborgs will be a reality by the 2030s.
[02:17:51.673 --> 02:18:02.578]  The Director of Engineering at Google said that people will soon be able to connect their brains directly to the cloud and augment their existing intelligence with thousands of computers.
[02:18:02.578 --> 02:18:09.982]  Thanks to DNA nanobots making the connection, our thinking will become a hybrid of biological and non-biological thinking.
[02:18:10.402 --> 02:18:16.968]  Kurzweil adds that by the early 2040s, people will be more like machines than they will be human.
[02:18:16.968 --> 02:18:21.612]  And he even suggests that we'll be able to back up our brains like a hard drive.
[02:18:21.612 --> 02:18:22.693]  But guess what?
[02:18:22.693 --> 02:18:26.657]  Star Trek already conquered this territory in the 90s.
[02:18:26.657 --> 02:18:27.438]  I am the Borg.
[02:18:27.998 --> 02:18:31.100]  The Cyborg represents the dark side of humanity.
[02:18:31.100 --> 02:18:36.804]  What happens when technology falls into the wrong hands and is used to dehumanize us.
[02:18:36.804 --> 02:18:40.366]  The Star Trek Borgs became one with their technology.
[02:18:40.366 --> 02:18:43.709]  It stripped them of their humanity and their individuality.
[02:18:43.709 --> 02:18:46.210]  They became like zombies in a metal shell.
[02:18:46.210 --> 02:18:49.933]  They were now part of a collective network on a vast computer system
[02:18:50.413 --> 02:18:55.035]  Controlled telepathically by this mysterious Borg Queen.
[02:18:55.035 --> 02:19:05.119]  Kind of makes you think there's a possibility something could be telepathically controlling us if we ever were to upload our brains to the cloud as Kurzweil suggests.
[02:19:05.119 --> 02:19:06.219]  Assimilate this.
[02:19:09.096 --> 02:19:16.442]  And even though we hear the word singularity by 2045, the fact is, man merging with machine has already happened.
[02:19:16.442 --> 02:19:22.808]  Professor Kevin Warwick is head of the cybernetics and robotics department at Reading University in the UK.
[02:19:22.808 --> 02:19:29.974]  In 1998, he was able to connect his nervous system to the internet via a chip implanted in his arm.
[02:19:29.974 --> 02:19:33.738]  He then used the web to allow him to control a robotic arm.
[02:19:34.158 --> 02:19:35.459]  And that was in the 90s.
[02:19:35.459 --> 02:19:45.205]  And he, like Kurzweil and other transhumanists, gave this ominous warning that by not upgrading, we would be considered subspecies in the future.
[02:19:45.205 --> 02:19:52.850]  And surprise, surprise, artificial intelligence is one of the topics up for discussion at this year's Bilderberg Conference.
[02:19:52.850 --> 02:19:57.874]  Former DARPA director and now Google exec, Regina Dugan, will be in attendance.
[02:19:58.294 --> 02:20:04.338]  Dugan is helping to develop and promote the idea of an ingestible identification microchip.
[02:20:04.338 --> 02:20:09.442]  Yeah, absolutely not worrisome at all that Google is now hiring military leadership.
[02:20:09.442 --> 02:20:23.112]  Users would swallow a chip in pill form every day in order to obtain the superpower of having their entire body act as a biological password for cell phones, cars, doors, and other devices.
[02:20:23.652 --> 02:20:41.409]  But I'm sure it means absolutely nothing that artificial intelligence will be discussed this week at a top secret meeting of the world's power brokers, when people like Elon Musk and Stephen Hawking have warned that artificial intelligence has the potential to destroy humanity if it falls in the wrong hands.
[02:20:41.409 --> 02:20:48.796]  I have one simple request, and that is to have sharks with frickin' laser beams attached to their heads!
[02:20:50.967 --> 02:20:51.948]  We're going into overdrive.
[02:20:51.948 --> 02:20:52.929]  God bless you all.

[02:20:56.073 --> 02:21:02.640]  Obama has ordered the biggest airplane for Air Force One ever made, but he wants to restrict everybody else's air travel with carbon taxes.
[02:21:02.640 --> 02:21:03.882]  Tell you about that coming up too.
[02:21:03.882 --> 02:21:05.744]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:21:11.934 --> 02:21:18.581]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:21:18.581 --> 02:21:22.546]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:21:22.546 --> 02:21:28.832]  Alright, I'm going to shoot a special report for the nightly news, getting into this article at Drudge Report.
[02:21:28.832 --> 02:21:33.057]  Obama cracks down on airplane emissions, buys massive new Air Force One.
[02:21:33.057 --> 02:21:33.878]  Biggest ever.
[02:21:35.251 --> 02:21:40.315]  Longest ever, big special plane, huge emissions, but that's okay because government's exempt.
[02:21:40.315 --> 02:21:46.941]  They're coming out with these new emissions that are basically taxes for the rest of the aircraft industry, basically crippling U.S.
[02:21:46.941 --> 02:21:52.725]  manufacturers because the foreign manufacturers like Airbus won't follow it.
[02:21:52.725 --> 02:22:01.913]  But this bypasses all the chemtrailing that's being added to the jet fuel, the barium salts, the aluminum dioxide, that we know is going on the geoengineering.
[02:22:03.069 --> 02:22:08.590]  We are not in Kansas anymore, and it is a dystopic situation that we're going into.
[02:22:08.590 --> 02:22:09.671]  We're trying to change that.
[02:22:09.671 --> 02:22:23.574]  There's still so many wonderful things in this world and good things happening, but so many markets, as LIBOR has shown us and currency speculation has shown us, we live in a rigged market, and that's what Kit Daniels broke down in this excellent report.
[02:22:24.790 --> 02:22:27.171]  Kit Daniels, InfoWars.com.
[02:22:27.171 --> 02:22:32.712]  Did you know the Bilderberg Group was directly responsible for the 1973 oil crisis that occurred here in America?
[02:22:32.712 --> 02:22:37.294]  Most people think it was OPEC that orchestrated the entire thing, but that wasn't quite the case.
[02:22:37.294 --> 02:22:39.774]  It was in fact the Bilderberg Group's idea.
[02:22:39.774 --> 02:22:45.536]  In May of 1973, about five months before the oil crisis occurred, the Bilderberg Group met in secret.
[02:22:45.996 --> 02:22:55.401]  And the meeting included several CEOs of oil companies such as Exxon and British Petroleum, as well as President Nixon's National Security Advisor, Henry Kissinger.
[02:22:55.401 --> 02:22:59.864]  They predicted that soon there'd be about a 400% increase in the price of oil.
[02:22:59.864 --> 02:23:09.169]  And then, you know, on October 6, 1973, after the meeting, the Yonkipper War occurred, which directly led to the increase in oil prices.
[02:23:09.169 --> 02:23:11.050]  But how did the Bilderberg Group know this?
[02:23:11.050 --> 02:23:12.230]  They planned it.
[02:23:12.230 --> 02:23:12.631]  But why?
[02:23:13.732 --> 02:23:35.964]  As economist F. William Engdahl noted in his book, A Century of War, one enormous consequence of the ensuring 400% rise in OPEC oil prices was that investments of hundreds of millions of dollars by British Petroleum, Royal Dutch Shell, both of whom were present at the 1973 Bilderberg meeting, and other Anglo-American petroleum concerns in the risky North Sea could produce oil at a profit.
[02:23:36.604 --> 02:23:44.666]  He continued, the profitability of these new North Sea oil fields was not at all secure until after the OPEC price rises.
[02:23:44.666 --> 02:23:52.408]  So the Bilderberg Group came up with the idea of an oil crisis to ensure profitability for the oil companies connected to Bilderberg.
[02:23:52.408 --> 02:23:57.609]  And the former oil minister for Saudi Arabia, Sheikh Yamadi, confirmed this.
[02:23:57.609 --> 02:24:02.970]  In 2001, Yamadi said, I am 100% sure that the Americans were behind the increase in the price of oil.
[02:24:03.530 --> 02:24:05.852]  The oil companies were in real trouble at the time.
[02:24:05.852 --> 02:24:09.696]  They had borrowed a lot of money, and they needed a high oil price to save them.
[02:24:09.696 --> 02:24:23.849]  Imadi also said that when he visited Iran in 1974 on official oil business, he was told that it was in fact Henry Kissinger who wanted to raise the oil prices, and that Kissinger wanted a war in the Middle East in order to justify the said price increase.
[02:24:24.830 --> 02:24:36.674]  And a few weeks before the Yom Kippur War occurred, Kissinger, who was now the Secretary of State under Nixon, he issued a statement saying that if there was a war that was going to break out in the Middle East, that U.S.
[02:24:36.674 --> 02:24:40.695]  military intervention was completely out of the question.
[02:24:40.695 --> 02:24:51.479]  Basically, Kissinger used secret diplomatic channels to ensure that not only would the war happen as badly as possible, but that OPEC would use the war to justify a price increase.
[02:24:52.539 --> 02:24:59.006]  Kissinger downplayed the war, for example, to President Nixon and took control of the situation himself.
[02:24:59.006 --> 02:25:08.835]  In fact, the National Security Agency found out about the war two days before it happened, but they were told by the White House, under advisement from Kissinger, to sit on the information.
[02:25:09.756 --> 02:25:14.020]  And also, Kissinger told the Israelis to stand down and let the war happen.
[02:25:14.020 --> 02:25:15.942]  And the rest, you know, is history.
