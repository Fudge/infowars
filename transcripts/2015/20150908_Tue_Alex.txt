[00:00:00.069 --> 00:00:00.935]  Spend Liberty Worldwide!
[00:00:15.768 --> 00:00:16.388]  Big Brother.
[00:00:17.069 --> 00:00:18.090]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:19.931]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:20.592 --> 00:00:21.392]  You want answers?
[00:00:22.173 --> 00:00:23.053]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:23.714 --> 00:00:27.356]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:27.917 --> 00:00:32.020]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:34.822 --> 00:00:40.506]  It's already the 8th day of September, 2015, on this Tuesday Worldwide Broadcast.
[00:00:41.086 --> 00:00:43.248]  Feels like a Monday.
[00:00:43.268 --> 00:00:44.209]  We just had
[00:00:45.313 --> 00:00:47.974]  Labor Day, the International Workers' Communist Day.
[00:00:47.994 --> 00:00:56.416]  The very groups and organizations that always end up impoverishing populations into a North Korean or Cuban-style hell.
[00:00:57.836 --> 00:00:59.496]  But here we are, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:59.536 --> 00:01:03.237]  Thank you so much for joining us for this worldwide transmission.
[00:01:03.277 --> 00:01:06.998]  The news is particularly over-the-top.
[00:01:08.356 --> 00:01:17.841]  Coming up later in the broadcast, Paul Watson is going to be joining us to break down his story that's up on DrudgeReport.com.
[00:01:18.582 --> 00:01:34.271]  Muslim refugees chant Allah Akbar F U, attack citizens, throw feces, and they're so socialist and so liberal and so entitled, they believe Europe literally belongs to them and everything is free.
[00:01:34.411 --> 00:01:35.472]  A percentage of these
[00:01:36.452 --> 00:01:36.853]  Immigrants.
[00:01:37.253 --> 00:01:40.755]  And they wear t-shirts we have photos of saying, fear for your wife.
[00:01:42.517 --> 00:01:50.222]  And it is just a... There's an entitlement, but also with these third world populations, let's just face it, massive class envy.
[00:01:51.323 --> 00:02:04.353]  And an idea that wealthy Westerners are there and are the problem in the world because our own media pushes that idea while using our money and our military to go and destabilize the countries these people are from.
[00:02:06.052 --> 00:02:11.557]  And these aren't the hard-working immigrants, many of them, that have come here in the past from the Middle East, Africa, and places.
[00:02:12.338 --> 00:02:15.040]  A lot of these are criminals, people that have changed their names.
[00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:16.121]  That's in the news.
[00:02:16.522 --> 00:02:18.023]  That have gotten fake passports.
[00:02:18.063 --> 00:02:19.564]  There's a huge business doing that.
[00:02:20.285 --> 00:02:26.751]  Pat Buchanan calls it the Islamic invasion of Europe.
[00:02:28.396 --> 00:02:30.538]  And that is exactly what is going on.
[00:02:30.618 --> 00:02:33.421]  This is a planned takedown of the West.
[00:02:33.881 --> 00:02:42.309]  With political correctness, if you're Christian, libertarian, or conservative, you will be arrested for reading the Bible or for following your Christian beliefs.
[00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:50.457]  But if you want to sexually mutilate your daughters and put hoods on their heads and not let them leave the house and chain them up, baby, you're going to be protected.
[00:02:52.366 --> 00:02:56.573]  Because there's a hate of the West in the scientific technocratic elite.
[00:02:56.973 --> 00:03:03.143]  Because it has free will, it has a renaissance in it, and that threatens the new dark age the globalists are bringing in.
[00:03:04.076 --> 00:03:07.520]  They're going to set up the Muslims in the end with the clash of civilizations.
[00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:18.871]  I'm not a quote Islamophobe, but the West has brought in radical leadership out of Saudi Arabia and other nations to take over the Middle East, Central Asia, and much of Africa.
[00:03:18.911 --> 00:03:24.957]  And they are forging Islam, you can debate whether it was before, into a weapon against the West.
[00:03:25.017 --> 00:03:26.819]  And Paul Watson put out an article
[00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:32.963]  You can look this up for yourself, but it's on Real Alex Jones on Twitter, and I think this image should go viral.
[00:03:33.743 --> 00:03:37.805]  Qatar, zero migrants, zero immigrants, zero refugees.
[00:03:38.185 --> 00:03:40.566]  Saudi Arabia, zero, zero.
[00:03:41.067 --> 00:03:42.187]  Bahrain, zero.
[00:03:42.427 --> 00:03:43.388]  Kuwait, zero.
[00:03:43.948 --> 00:03:45.149]  United Arab Emirates, zero.
[00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:47.990]  Oman, zero, zero, zero.
[00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:49.531]  How many Palestinians did they take?
[00:03:49.591 --> 00:03:51.492]  Zero, zero, zero.
[00:03:52.152 --> 00:03:56.915]  Only Germany, only France, only the United Kingdom, only the United States.
[00:03:57.356 --> 00:03:59.777]  It's our job to take the world's poor.
[00:04:00.177 --> 00:04:02.759]  It's our job for people to come here and have their babies for free.
[00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:08.983]  It's our job as a sacrament to give up any original Americana culture.
[00:04:10.344 --> 00:04:15.167]  And to submit, and to kneel, and to do what we're told.
[00:04:17.605 --> 00:04:19.327]  This is the social engineering.
[00:04:19.427 --> 00:04:22.370]  It is here to destroy our families, destroy our culture.
[00:04:23.911 --> 00:04:36.063]  And the minute people realize that poison's been fed to us, and that globalism and multiculturalism is nothing but pure tyranny, the minute we vomit this poison out is the sooner chance we've got of surviving.
[00:04:36.904 --> 00:04:38.185]  We've turned green.
[00:04:38.526 --> 00:04:40.287]  We've got blood coming out of our nose.
[00:04:41.519 --> 00:04:42.240]  Vomit it out!
[00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.181]  Stick your fingers down your throat!
[00:04:44.561 --> 00:04:45.202]  Get it out!
[00:04:45.562 --> 00:04:46.883]  Admit you were brainwashed!
[00:04:47.184 --> 00:04:49.906]  Break your conditioning now or all is lost!
[00:04:50.406 --> 00:04:52.168]  World government is officially here.
[00:04:53.028 --> 00:04:55.390]  It's now going to bring us into hell itself.
[00:04:55.871 --> 00:04:58.713]  They're now announcing major roads nationwide to be closed.
[00:04:59.313 --> 00:05:01.035]  The rest of the power plants to be shuttered.
[00:05:01.655 --> 00:05:06.319]  And the militarized police are getting their armored vehicles and preparing for war with gun owners.
[00:05:10.023 --> 00:05:12.105]  Do you know what it means to be an American?
[00:05:12.346 --> 00:05:13.547]  It's more than a flag.
[00:05:13.827 --> 00:05:16.490]  It's more than knowing the star-spangled banner.
[00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:18.072]  It's knowing the Constitution.
[00:05:18.292 --> 00:05:21.155]  It's understanding those rights and fighting for them.
[00:05:21.376 --> 00:05:24.539]  Our country's falling apart because people have forgotten to fight.
[00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:27.863]  To stand up in the face of tyranny and do the right thing.
[00:05:28.183 --> 00:05:33.187]  It's putting your life on the line to protect your country from enemies both foreign and domestic.
[00:05:33.307 --> 00:05:40.954]  The Bill of Rights is what the people are entitled to against every government and no government should refuse or rest on inference.
[00:05:41.494 --> 00:05:46.498]  So the Tree of Liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants.
[00:05:47.319 --> 00:05:51.803]  I'm Joe Biggs with Infowars.com, and I believe our flag is more than cloth and ink.
[00:05:52.243 --> 00:05:54.945]  It is a symbol that stands for liberty and freedom.
[00:05:55.305 --> 00:05:59.989]  It is a history of our nation, and it's marked by the blood of those who died defending it.
[00:06:00.469 --> 00:06:02.170]  So join me in this Infowar.
[00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:06.654]  Turn off your TV, put your Cheetos down, get off your butt and join the resistance.
[00:06:09.952 --> 00:06:14.976]  Introducing Secret 12, the new InfoWarsLife vitamin B12 formulation.

[00:06:26.004 --> 00:06:29.326]  Secret 12 is simply taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.

[00:06:39.854 --> 00:06:44.055]  Used since before the days of the Roman Empire to support the body's natural systems.
[00:06:44.215 --> 00:06:48.176]  Introducing the new InfoWarsLife.com Oil of Oregano formulation.
[00:06:48.376 --> 00:06:53.157]  We have now procured the most high quality and potent forms of oregano oil on the market.
[00:06:53.317 --> 00:06:57.838]  Extracted directly from the wild herb and sealed in easy to use capsules.
[00:06:57.978 --> 00:07:01.298]  You will no longer need to endure the burning of liquid oregano on the tongue.
[00:07:01.458 --> 00:07:04.759]  Now available in our limited first run at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:07:04.899 --> 00:07:06.739]  That's InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:13.584]  Alex Jones here with a very important news alert for InfoWars listeners.
[00:07:13.864 --> 00:07:24.175]  We've confirmed through our major suppliers attempting to resupply Survival Shield X2 Deep Earth Crystals that elite corporations are buying up the supplies all over the world.
[00:07:24.335 --> 00:07:27.238]  So prices are going up and it's very hard to secure it.
[00:07:27.398 --> 00:07:36.140]  We have been able to secure a limited supply of the Pure Deep Earth Crystals and have now been able to produce more Survival Shield Nascent Iodine X2.
[00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:37.941]  This is the good halogen.
[00:07:38.041 --> 00:07:40.781]  This is the opposite of the bad halogens like fluoride.
[00:07:41.102 --> 00:07:52.885]  Now we at Infowarslife.com are bringing you the only source of clean, pure, 99.99 Ultra Pure Deep Earth Crystals from more than 7,000 feet below the Earth's surface.
[00:07:53.105 --> 00:07:54.365]  Watch the informational videos

[00:08:01.036 --> 00:08:01.957]  Folks, this isn't hype.
[00:08:02.098 --> 00:08:05.203]  Read the reviews for yourself at Infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:08:10.199 --> 00:08:10.779]  We've got it.
[00:08:10.819 --> 00:08:17.264]  This transmission is coming to you.
[00:08:17.344 --> 00:08:19.446]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:08:21.267 --> 00:08:31.234]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:08:31.574 --> 00:08:38.139]  We are coming to you from the ATX zone, deep in the heart of captured Texas FEMA Region 6.
[00:08:41.058 --> 00:08:45.580]  And you know, I come in here with that intro, and it's not hyperbole.
[00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:47.341]  It's not rhetoric.
[00:08:48.101 --> 00:08:50.042]  It's not hype.
[00:08:50.922 --> 00:08:52.743]  I am under a UN treaty.
[00:08:54.083 --> 00:08:55.984]  I am under UNESCO rule.
[00:08:57.225 --> 00:08:58.645]  I am under the Treaty of Rome.
[00:09:00.586 --> 00:09:02.487]  I am under Agenda 21.
[00:09:04.128 --> 00:09:07.790]  Signed by the President in 1992, never ratified by Congress.
[00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:10.891]  They brag at the Club of Rome publicly.
[00:09:11.572 --> 00:09:14.693]  They brag at the Council on Foreign Relations publicly.
[00:09:15.493 --> 00:09:20.556]  They brag at the United Nations in Davos and the Trilateral Commission publicly.
[00:09:21.096 --> 00:09:23.457]  They write scores of books publicly.
[00:09:23.777 --> 00:09:24.878]  Keyword publicly.
[00:09:25.338 --> 00:09:29.260]  Admitting the entire planetary world government plan.
[00:09:32.912 --> 00:09:37.996]  Back in the 70s, Senator Barry Goldwater wrote with no apologies.
[00:09:38.776 --> 00:09:41.038]  I read that book when I was 16 years old.
[00:09:41.558 --> 00:09:44.981]  Every stinking word of it is true.
[00:09:46.062 --> 00:09:48.263]  Every stinking word of it came true.
[00:09:51.085 --> 00:09:53.307]  I don't need to know what's coming or gonna happen.
[00:09:54.468 --> 00:09:58.551]  Our own government, people that were patriots, held it back for decades.
[00:09:59.918 --> 00:10:03.119]  Warned us, won some battles, lost others.
[00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:12.761]  The Globalists are between 10 and 15 years behind in their own words, and so now they are pedal to the metal.
[00:10:12.901 --> 00:10:14.742]  This is the final assault.
[00:10:15.422 --> 00:10:20.884]  They have decided to go, yeah, your kids can't do chores, it's child labor, we'll arrest you.
[00:10:21.224 --> 00:10:23.904]  $4,000 a day fines for any dust in a barn of hay.
[00:10:24.985 --> 00:10:25.745]  You can have no
[00:10:28.902 --> 00:10:30.042]  Classical light bulbs.
[00:10:31.443 --> 00:10:34.703]  You cannot say the word father or mother or boy or girl or he or she.
[00:10:35.823 --> 00:10:38.964]  We will arrest you if you're a county clerk and don't certify a gay marriage.
[00:10:39.944 --> 00:10:48.286]  We're gonna shut down half the roads in Austin, half the roads in Los Angeles, half the roads in New York, half the roads in Minneapolis-St.
[00:10:48.326 --> 00:10:48.666]  Paul.
[00:10:49.166 --> 00:10:50.027]  You're like, no they won't.
[00:10:50.207 --> 00:10:51.027]  It's being announced.
[00:10:51.527 --> 00:10:56.768]  They're in the LA Times today saying, we're gonna shut everything down and teach you to live sustainably.
[00:10:57.927 --> 00:11:01.189]  But what they don't tell you is, it's for control, not to help the Earth.
[00:11:01.429 --> 00:11:07.473]  They're doing the genetic engineering, the Hadron manipulations, and all these things we know, the leaking reactors.
[00:11:07.953 --> 00:11:11.495]  They don't care about the Earth and the real red-level crises.
[00:11:11.715 --> 00:11:14.957]  They're using this as a neo-feudalistic putsch.
[00:11:16.198 --> 00:11:17.619]  A total takeover.
[00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:21.661]  First, they prime us with political correctness.
[00:11:23.902 --> 00:11:26.304]  They go in and destabilize North Africa and the Middle East.
[00:11:27.671 --> 00:11:32.134]  There's a billion people in the Middle East and North Africa and Central Asia.
[00:11:32.555 --> 00:11:33.656]  A billion plus.
[00:11:36.498 --> 00:11:43.283]  And they now are setting it up with the news media and Western-run Al Jazeera, going, how dare the West not accept millions?
[00:11:43.323 --> 00:11:45.004]  How dare they not give you everything free?
[00:11:45.285 --> 00:11:49.148]  With TVs blaring as tens of thousands a day.
[00:11:50.796 --> 00:11:57.457]  Pour into every European country, and they are carjacking the trucks, they are beating people up.
[00:11:57.477 --> 00:11:58.738]  We're going to put this on the Nightly News tonight.
[00:11:58.778 --> 00:12:02.178]  I've shown you on the radio slash TV here, but we're going to produce a whole piece.
[00:12:02.959 --> 00:12:13.861]  Just type into YouTube, migrants or illegals carjack, truckjack, trucks waiting for ferries, buses waiting for ferries.
[00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:25.628]  You can see in Macedonia, or in Czechoslovakia, or in other countries, just human waves of thousands hitting the fences and climbing over.
[00:12:27.810 --> 00:12:41.261]  And then showing up, and then major governments saying, you will pay for these people, you'll pay for their kids, and in Sweden, they're trying to pass a law to make you house them in your house.
[00:12:44.735 --> 00:12:47.897]  But let's put the graphic up that's at RealAlexJones on Twitter.
[00:12:48.038 --> 00:12:51.240]  I want to create a graphic of this and send it out on Facebook and everywhere else.
[00:12:55.203 --> 00:13:10.275]  How many of the quote refugees is Saudi Arabia running the Al-Qaeda and ISIS attacks to destabilize these countries and make them collapse so there are giant migrant waves into which ISIS and Al-Qaeda admit they're infiltrating and hiding?
[00:13:12.679 --> 00:13:28.547]  How many did the country that quarterbacked the whole operation with NATO to destabilize the Middle East, how many migrants, migrants, they call them illegals there, and imprison them, or throw them out, how many precious migrants, how many precious illegal aliens did Saudi Arabia take?
[00:13:28.967 --> 00:13:36.191]  Zip, nada, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero.
[00:13:36.511 --> 00:13:40.353]  And by the way, if you're a new listener, the New York Times had the headline yesterday.
[00:13:40.373 --> 00:13:41.694]  No, it was on Sunday, I covered it.
[00:13:43.576 --> 00:13:46.518]  Saudi Arabia is criticized for not taking refugees.
[00:13:46.598 --> 00:13:50.059]  If you're a new viewer, you're like, there's no way they didn't take anybody.
[00:13:50.359 --> 00:13:50.800]  Oh yes!
[00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:59.584]  They knocked the beehive over, and then they opened our window up and said, fly in here, but they're not taking a single illegal alien.
[00:14:03.006 --> 00:14:04.947]  Now, let's go back to the graphic.
[00:14:05.667 --> 00:14:09.069]  How many people from the next country
[00:14:12.233 --> 00:14:14.354]  How many people did the next country take?
[00:14:16.735 --> 00:14:19.916]  It's up on Twitter, at Real Alex Jones.
[00:14:20.437 --> 00:14:22.798]  Saudi Arabia, zero, zero, zero.
[00:14:23.078 --> 00:14:25.059]  Bahrain, zero, zero, zero.
[00:14:25.339 --> 00:14:27.180]  Qatar, zero, zero, zero.
[00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:29.241]  Kuwait, zero, zero, zero.
[00:14:29.641 --> 00:14:31.482]  UAE, zero, zero, zero.
[00:14:31.802 --> 00:14:33.603]  Oman, zero, zero, zero.
[00:14:34.023 --> 00:14:36.144]  All of them, zero, zero, zero.
[00:14:37.025 --> 00:14:40.068]  We have a link to a video report showing all the articles breaking it down.
[00:14:40.408 --> 00:14:51.737]  But then you've got arrogant, hateful, mainly 20-year-old men, 18 to 25 is the average age, with their fake passports from all over the world, screaming with hatred.
[00:14:51.958 --> 00:15:00.385]  They've been watching Western porn, they've been watching MTV, they've mutated with the bizarre gangster cop-killer culture.
[00:15:00.865 --> 00:15:02.186]  Go to Europe, that's all you see.
[00:15:02.587 --> 00:15:04.848]  They're the majority now in most major cities.
[00:15:05.836 --> 00:15:19.643]  And they openly brag, your wives, your daughters, everything belongs to us, we are conquerors, get out of our way, and Europeans are knocked knee with political correctness and literally fall down and urinate on themselves in front of anyone that says you do it, you're racist.
[00:15:19.943 --> 00:15:32.149]  Germans, Dutch, all of them, French, UK, they are so politically correct, they hit their knees and say, here's everything.
[00:15:35.558 --> 00:15:37.179]  This is a full-on assault.
[00:15:37.379 --> 00:15:39.680]  And you see the same thing here with Latin America.
[00:15:39.860 --> 00:15:40.380]  Opened up.
[00:15:40.900 --> 00:15:41.520]  Flooded in.
[00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:43.601]  Oh, first it's refugee children.
[00:15:44.702 --> 00:15:45.782]  Now it's their families.
[00:15:45.822 --> 00:15:46.862]  Then it's their families.
[00:15:47.243 --> 00:15:52.625]  Everything paid for being housed at Democratic Party homes.
[00:15:53.125 --> 00:15:55.466]  $7,000 per three immigrants they take per month.
[00:15:55.686 --> 00:15:56.826]  They warehouse them in a room.
[00:15:57.106 --> 00:15:58.167]  Give them driver's license.
[00:15:58.407 --> 00:15:59.127]  Start them voting.
[00:15:59.687 --> 00:16:00.648]  Get them on welfare.
[00:16:01.128 --> 00:16:02.449]  Skim part of the welfare.
[00:16:02.469 --> 00:16:03.469]  This is on record.
[00:16:05.213 --> 00:16:07.414]  Because it's a mafia organization, the Democratic Party.
[00:16:07.434 --> 00:16:09.155]  It's like Akron on steroids.
[00:16:09.655 --> 00:16:10.176]  Times ten.
[00:16:11.056 --> 00:16:11.757]  And all their scams.
[00:16:12.017 --> 00:16:13.998]  Hey, I got some underage sex slaves I want to run.
[00:16:14.018 --> 00:16:14.838]  You're going to help?
[00:16:14.858 --> 00:16:15.158]  Of course!
[00:16:15.179 --> 00:16:15.799]  That's what we do!
[00:16:16.799 --> 00:16:17.060]  Really?
[00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:17.740]  Well, here.
[00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:18.861]  Project Veritas.
[00:16:18.881 --> 00:16:20.041]  Let's go to the next facility.
[00:16:20.201 --> 00:16:21.282]  Yeah, we got sex slaves.
[00:16:21.422 --> 00:16:21.742]  Great!
[00:16:21.862 --> 00:16:22.563]  That's what we're into.
[00:16:22.583 --> 00:16:25.684]  Let me tell you how to just keep them in the school, pay the taxes.
[00:16:25.964 --> 00:16:26.705]  You won't have any problem.
[00:16:27.906 --> 00:16:28.226]  Alright.
[00:16:30.447 --> 00:16:31.548]  This is the new system.
[00:16:32.768 --> 00:16:33.789]  This is how it works.
[00:16:35.083 --> 00:16:42.126]  And so they bring the people in, they house them, they get them voting, they get them a job at the meat packing plant or cleaning your house.
[00:16:42.446 --> 00:16:44.627]  They're hard-working people on average trying to flee tyranny.
[00:16:45.807 --> 00:16:49.008]  But then they put them on welfare under multiple IDs.
[00:16:49.328 --> 00:16:50.609]  They get tax refunds.
[00:16:50.989 --> 00:16:56.651]  One house in Austin, I forget, got something like $89 million in tax returns four years ago.
[00:16:56.891 --> 00:16:58.171]  But Atlanta beat Austin.
[00:16:58.372 --> 00:17:00.933]  It was a hundred and something million at one house.
[00:17:01.333 --> 00:17:01.833]  And guess what?
[00:17:01.893 --> 00:17:04.514]  There was no investigation, no charges.
[00:17:05.694 --> 00:17:10.677]  Do you think illegal aliens were really getting hundreds of millions of dollars at houses?
[00:17:11.397 --> 00:17:11.597]  No.
[00:17:12.258 --> 00:17:15.400]  They run it through them as cutouts for the takedown.
[00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:22.343]  But then, you're going 10 miles over the speed limit, Johnny Law pulls you over, did you know you were speeding?
[00:17:24.665 --> 00:17:26.226]  What, you got any drugs in this car?
[00:17:26.586 --> 00:17:28.127]  What, you mean drugs the government shipped in?
[00:17:30.723 --> 00:17:33.425]  I'm a highway patrol, the highway patrol.
[00:17:33.705 --> 00:17:36.147]  My hours are long and my pay is low.
[00:17:37.448 --> 00:17:39.969]  But I'll do my best to keep you driving slow.
[00:17:40.229 --> 00:17:42.991]  I'm just doing my job, I'm a highway patrol.
[00:17:44.432 --> 00:17:44.692]  Really?
[00:17:44.712 --> 00:17:45.793]  You're really doing your job?
[00:17:45.813 --> 00:17:46.093]  No.
[00:17:46.554 --> 00:17:47.634]  You're an errand boy.
[00:17:48.215 --> 00:17:49.776]  Out there to raise money off people.
[00:17:49.836 --> 00:17:51.217]  I'm not attacking you individually.
[00:17:51.477 --> 00:17:54.379]  When the globalists are done with you, they're gonna throw you in the fire as well.
[00:17:54.659 --> 00:18:00.123]  This is a full, dishonorable, scientific, mafia warfare takedown.
[00:18:01.539 --> 00:18:02.199]  And it's here.
[00:18:02.799 --> 00:18:07.820]  Everything you've heard us talk about is now going to unfold in triplicate spades.
[00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:10.261]  Ace of spades, ace of spades, ace of spades.
[00:18:10.581 --> 00:18:11.601]  Tyranny, tyranny, tyranny.
[00:18:11.881 --> 00:18:14.382]  Forced inoculations, forced GMO.
[00:18:14.962 --> 00:18:20.403]  The school's telling your kids that you don't belong to them and giving them whatever they want and taking them away from you.
[00:18:20.823 --> 00:18:22.364]  You want it, baby?
[00:18:22.384 --> 00:18:24.384]  You're about to get it.
[00:18:25.933 --> 00:18:32.054]  This is the military, psychological, military-industrial complex takedown of the West.
[00:18:34.074 --> 00:18:37.475]  Which was the only lifeline to industrialize and build up the third world.
[00:18:37.495 --> 00:18:43.836]  They're gonna, don't worry, for those of you that are racist, because I'm not, I don't dislike these migrants, but they are weaponized.
[00:18:44.376 --> 00:18:53.878]  They are illegal, they are filled with cultural revolution, they are filled with liberation theology, they are filled with entitlement and hatred.
[00:18:55.370 --> 00:18:56.331]  Let's go out to break.
[00:18:56.951 --> 00:19:11.384]  Muslim refugees in Budapest chanted Allah Akbar and FU while others in Italy attacked an old lady and threw feces at bystanders as Germany announced that it would be prepared to take 500,000 asylum seekers every few months.
[00:19:12.245 --> 00:19:13.386]  And it's going to get bigger than that.
[00:19:15.495 --> 00:19:16.536]  And they've been covering it up.
[00:19:16.696 --> 00:19:22.081]  Also, videos on InfoWars of throat-slitting motions and t-shirts.
[00:19:22.181 --> 00:19:24.843]  I'm gonna get your wife and all the rest of it.
[00:19:24.943 --> 00:19:26.124]  I mean, it is on.
[00:19:26.184 --> 00:19:33.950]  And when you watch hordes of young, able men in France, the cops do nothing and they just walk up and they just grab those truck drivers out.
[00:19:34.251 --> 00:19:35.572]  Those truck drivers just submit.
[00:19:35.612 --> 00:19:36.753]  They just look at them with disdain.
[00:19:37.981 --> 00:19:39.622]  Because they've been taught to submit in France.
[00:19:40.083 --> 00:19:43.666]  Let me tell you, I don't care if I was disarmed, I'd have a baseball bat.
[00:19:43.686 --> 00:19:46.488]  If you're going to pull me out of my car, I'm going to beat 20 people's brains out.
[00:19:47.328 --> 00:19:48.790]  But that's why America was free!
[00:19:48.890 --> 00:19:50.331]  Because we got a killer instinct!
[00:19:50.551 --> 00:19:58.858]  And I'm going to tell you right now, globalists, I'm not bending over to my family being run over and taken over by globalist hordes that you've wound up.
[00:19:59.707 --> 00:20:10.433]  They take our culture away, they take our manhood away, they cut our collective genitals off, and they invade us with hardcore, old-world people that live in the Stone Age, licking their lips.
[00:20:10.453 --> 00:20:12.274]  Why are there fish swimming in our bathtub?
[00:20:12.474 --> 00:20:13.254]  Aren't they cute?
[00:20:13.494 --> 00:20:18.277]  You need more Omega-3s, and those fish oil pills with toxins and heavy metals are scary.
[00:20:18.637 --> 00:20:20.278]  So I'm making fish oil from scratch.
[00:20:20.718 --> 00:20:23.441]  Oh boy, didn't I tell you I'm ordering Nutrigold fish oil?
[00:20:23.681 --> 00:20:25.062]  It's exceptionally pure.
[00:20:25.402 --> 00:20:26.563]  That's what they all say.
[00:20:26.884 --> 00:20:27.364]  No, really.
[00:20:27.604 --> 00:20:34.711]  Nutrigold's fish oil is concentrated from pure cold water fish straight off the Alaskan coast and manufactured right here in the USA.
[00:20:34.951 --> 00:20:40.315]  Well, cold Alaskan waters are much more pristine than the polluted waters that other fish oils are sourced from.
[00:20:40.335 --> 00:20:41.316]  That's what I'm saying.
[00:20:41.677 --> 00:20:46.341]  And it's five-star certified to meet international purity, potency, and freshness standards.
[00:20:46.641 --> 00:20:47.862]  Well, that sounds even better!
[00:20:48.082 --> 00:20:48.382]  Great!
[00:20:48.502 --> 00:20:50.262]  I'll be in my office ordering a few bottles.
[00:20:50.443 --> 00:20:57.005]  If I order now on www.fishoil.best, I can save $5 using the promo code MYFISHOIL.
[00:20:57.325 --> 00:20:59.826]  Um, honey, why are there bees in my office?
[00:21:00.046 --> 00:21:01.467]  Get rid of those fish burps for good.
[00:21:01.587 --> 00:21:02.607]  Go to Nutrigold's U.S.
[00:21:02.647 --> 00:21:09.450]  made fish oil products by going to www.fishoil.best and get $5 off by entering MYFISHOIL at checkout.
[00:21:09.853 --> 00:21:10.693]  We're good to go.
[00:21:39.762 --> 00:21:43.323]  Just recently, we've witnessed some of the most catastrophic disasters in history.
[00:21:43.603 --> 00:21:49.664]  Be sure to prepare yourself with great-tasting, high-quality, GMO-free food that has a 25-year shelf life.
[00:21:50.204 --> 00:21:53.565]  Of course, we're talking about the foods from SurvivalFoodAlliance.com.
[00:21:54.025 --> 00:21:59.566]  And don't forget, the human body needs up to 3 quarts of water every day to remain healthy and hydrated.

[00:22:11.443 --> 00:22:14.926]  The Electronic Frontier Foundation Privacy Report says it's AT&T.
[00:22:15.186 --> 00:22:19.989]  AT&T customers need to know this when calling the Alex Jones 24-7 listen line at 1-605-562-9000.

[00:24:07.033 --> 00:24:07.913]  Come and take it!
[00:24:16.801 --> 00:24:23.066]  I got a star on my car and one on my chest, a gun on my hip and the right to arrest.
[00:24:23.186 --> 00:24:29.552]  I'm a guy who's a boss on this highway, so watch out what you're doing when you're driving my way.
[00:24:29.832 --> 00:24:31.934]  If you break the law, you'll hear from me.
[00:24:32.154 --> 00:24:35.777]  I know I'm working for the state on my highway patrol.
[00:24:37.818 --> 00:24:38.900]  You drive too fast!
[00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:41.282]  Is Junior Brown bringing us in?
[00:25:02.586 --> 00:25:08.649]  If you drive too fast like you shouldn't do, you can bet your boots I'm coming after you.
[00:25:10.209 --> 00:25:10.489]  Really!
[00:25:10.970 --> 00:25:19.653]  But you're not allowed to go off the private Federal Reserve that's been caught since the 70s laundering hundreds of billions of dollars per year of drug money on record.
[00:25:19.773 --> 00:25:21.234]  I mean, it's been in the Associated Press.
[00:25:21.954 --> 00:25:23.875]  It's been in Bloomberg.
[00:25:24.976 --> 00:25:27.837]  That Wachovia, Wells Fargo, $378 billion in drug money over two years.
[00:25:32.864 --> 00:25:33.465]  They all do it.
[00:25:34.465 --> 00:25:38.289]  But little banks have to fill out suspicious customer reports on people.
[00:25:38.869 --> 00:25:42.873]  If an old lady gets out $1,000 cash, it's not $10,000 or more, folks.
[00:25:43.173 --> 00:25:44.474]  I was talking to a banker just the other day.
[00:25:44.835 --> 00:25:51.620]  And then if you're a small-town branch, they come in with investigators and call you a criminal because you didn't put anybody in a database.
[00:25:52.449 --> 00:26:06.589]  Remember the head of the federal marshals over a whole sector, the air marshals, a few years ago was in the Denver Post, ended up getting in trouble for blowing the whistle and said, we are ordered to put innocent people in terrorist databases to create the perception of a terror threat on the airplanes.
[00:26:08.180 --> 00:26:11.861]  If a old woman orders a vegetarian meal, they're put in a database.
[00:26:12.321 --> 00:26:16.382]  If a family takes a picture of themselves getting on the airplane, we put them in a database.
[00:26:16.782 --> 00:26:19.663]  I will not be part of this fraud, and my agents do not want to do this.
[00:26:20.523 --> 00:26:21.864]  We signed up to protect people.
[00:26:22.184 --> 00:26:23.284]  I actually had him on as a guest.
[00:26:24.945 --> 00:26:36.928]  So the average person in the government is more aware of this than even I. The problem is they're purging all the people that want to actually be good stewards and follow their oaths, and they're putting in people that know there's a criminal takeover.
[00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:40.161]  I've had the ATF twice in person.
[00:26:40.621 --> 00:26:42.162]  Once at a gun show and once on the street.
[00:26:43.663 --> 00:26:51.527]  Basically come right up to me with the most criminal, hateful look of predatory evil and tell me they're gonna get me.
[00:26:52.187 --> 00:26:53.368]  And I better watch my butt.
[00:26:56.990 --> 00:27:00.832]  And then they just can't believe it when I just throw my hands up and go, well then do something!
[00:27:01.052 --> 00:27:01.972]  What's your problem?
[00:27:02.833 --> 00:27:03.733]  What is your problem?
[00:27:03.873 --> 00:27:05.094]  Why do you hate good people?
[00:27:07.116 --> 00:27:10.619]  You hate us because we remind you what piles of steaming crap you are!
[00:27:12.360 --> 00:27:13.421]  You stupid scum!
[00:27:14.042 --> 00:27:19.206]  Once the revolution kicks off, you idiots, you're gonna be one of the worst positions out there!
[00:27:19.546 --> 00:27:21.127]  And I don't take any pleasure in that!
[00:27:22.328 --> 00:27:26.212]  You think you can bomb yourselves in Oklahoma City and make yourselves victims?
[00:27:26.952 --> 00:27:28.814]  Everybody sees through that, stupid!
[00:27:30.395 --> 00:27:33.037]  Man, I'm in such an aggressive mood.
[00:27:33.077 --> 00:27:34.618]  I'm glad I took a few days off because
[00:27:35.649 --> 00:27:36.990]  I'm ready to fight the New World Order.
[00:27:37.010 --> 00:27:37.630]  I'm here to tell you.
[00:27:39.531 --> 00:27:40.652]  I watch these videos.
[00:27:41.432 --> 00:27:42.713]  I mean, it's a fact, okay?
[00:27:42.753 --> 00:27:44.134]  Let's get past the political correctness.
[00:27:45.434 --> 00:27:46.595]  I'm not an Islamophobic.
[00:27:46.655 --> 00:27:52.198]  I was against all these wars to destabilize the Middle East, to cause a clash of civilizations, and put in really bad regimes.
[00:27:52.458 --> 00:27:57.941]  But Western exported hip-hop mixed with woman-hating elements of radical Islam.
[00:27:59.061 --> 00:28:00.382]  The anthropologist admits this.
[00:28:00.402 --> 00:28:03.804]  The sociologist has created a radical gangbanger
[00:28:05.464 --> 00:28:15.888]  Beyond straight-out-of-Compton mutation, just like hillbilly kids in the Ozarks are imitating inner-city gangsterism, because all they were imitating was Al Capone, people like that.
[00:28:16.169 --> 00:28:17.649]  Everything's a copy of the last group.
[00:28:20.070 --> 00:28:26.293]  And in Europe, rape is up more than tenfold.
[00:28:27.884 --> 00:28:36.267]  And it's because the police will not enforce or go after Western women, and I mean young girls, people's 14-year-old daughters, getting raped by radical Muslims.
[00:28:37.967 --> 00:28:40.048]  And if fathers fight back, they're arrested.
[00:28:41.389 --> 00:28:51.132]  There have been famous cases where gypsies broke into a guy's house five times, he got an old shotgun, double barrel, that had been his father's, he was an old farmer himself, shot one of them.
[00:28:52.012 --> 00:28:56.634]  Last time I heard, he's still in jail, they won a lawsuit against him and didn't get in trouble.
[00:28:57.719 --> 00:29:04.623]  In England, the gypsies are allowed, saying it's their culture, to steal your RVs.
[00:29:05.163 --> 00:29:06.344]  They call them wagons there.
[00:29:06.864 --> 00:29:07.345]  Don't believe me?
[00:29:07.365 --> 00:29:11.147]  Just type in, police will not return wagons stolen.
[00:29:12.007 --> 00:29:15.389]  And it's not just bashing Romanian gypsies who go back to India.
[00:29:17.370 --> 00:29:20.872]  Europeans regularly thought they were from Egypt, so that's where the word gypsy comes from.
[00:29:21.213 --> 00:29:21.813]  Egypt, gypsy.
[00:29:23.814 --> 00:29:27.435]  But we're talking about pikeys that everybody acts like are so cute and funny and cool.
[00:29:28.116 --> 00:29:29.396]  And they're out of Ireland.
[00:29:29.496 --> 00:29:30.436]  And I'm not bashing Irish.
[00:29:30.497 --> 00:29:31.017]  I'm part Irish.
[00:29:31.257 --> 00:29:39.760]  But it's just Irish scum who thinks it's their responsibility and their right to rob and kill and steal whatever they want.
[00:29:39.780 --> 00:29:42.061]  And they make movies with Brad Pitt how cute it is.
[00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:47.382]  I don't know, some pikey comes around here wanting to rob me and my family, I'll beat your brains out with a baseball bat!
[00:29:47.722 --> 00:29:49.362]  I am sick of these criminal cultures!
[00:29:50.163 --> 00:29:55.705]  And they're just telling Europe, everybody, it's free reign, come rape us, come kill us, come piss on us, whatever you want.
[00:29:56.025 --> 00:29:56.285]  No!
[00:29:56.585 --> 00:29:57.446]  It stops now!
[00:29:59.086 --> 00:30:00.007]  We're on the march.
[00:30:00.507 --> 00:30:02.107]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:30:03.028 --> 00:30:05.729]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:10.114 --> 00:30:15.137]  Over the Labor Day weekend, we had reports of 8 being killed and 46 being wounded.
[00:30:15.558 --> 00:30:19.560]  July 4th of this year, we had reports of 9 dead and 53 wounded.
[00:30:20.040 --> 00:30:25.924]  And let us not forget, July 4th of last year, we had reports of 14 killed and 82 shot.
[00:30:26.444 --> 00:30:28.326]  And these are not nationwide stats.
[00:30:28.846 --> 00:30:34.830]  All of these numbers come from the city of Chicago, the city with some of the strictest gun laws in the nation.
[00:30:35.330 --> 00:30:40.074]  Which is to say, if criminals expect you to be unarmed, they're more likely to attack you.
[00:30:40.475 --> 00:30:44.758]  Not to mention the fact that much of this violence is linked to gangs or drug activity.
[00:30:45.239 --> 00:30:52.104]  Meaning that for all the gun buybacks and anti-gun commercials, criminals just haven't decided to turn in their firearms.
[00:30:52.885 --> 00:30:57.688]  And I understand that police have many responsibilities and they can't be every place at once.
[00:30:58.029 --> 00:31:01.931]  But that's why you have a Second Amendment so you'll be able to protect yourself.
[00:31:02.451 --> 00:31:05.994]  You can find more reports on InfoWars.com

[00:32:06.697 --> 00:32:10.938]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[00:32:11.258 --> 00:32:16.200]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health nerve growth factors.
[00:32:16.220 --> 00:32:16.520]  I don't know.
[00:32:37.757 --> 00:32:41.958]  Used since before the days of the Roman Empire to support the body's natural systems.
[00:32:42.138 --> 00:32:46.100]  Introducing the new Infowarslife.com oil of oregano formulation.

[00:33:02.825 --> 00:33:04.645]  That's Infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:33:10.178 --> 00:33:11.498]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:33:12.299 --> 00:33:13.659]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:54.958 --> 00:34:11.840]  We are live broadcasting worldwide and I am so fired up that I was basically running around screaming in the control room during the break until I settled down and did a little Facebook mentions live broadcast and I'm gonna start doing that a few times a day during the three-minute breaks.
[00:34:12.955 --> 00:34:14.796]  I'm going, we're doing video pieces we're airing.
[00:34:14.876 --> 00:34:18.158]  I'm going to start doing extra news and analysis at Facebook.
[00:34:18.579 --> 00:34:21.821]  I'm also going to do some of the live YouTube feeds as well.
[00:34:22.361 --> 00:34:28.906]  But some of these Facebook mentions we're doing, we've done like seven or eight of them so far, are getting 200 plus thousand viewers.
[00:34:29.566 --> 00:34:34.609]  We're talking tens of thousands at one time, and then over the next day, 200,000.
[00:34:34.869 --> 00:34:39.793]  And what's exciting is so many of those people are folks that don't even know who we are.
[00:34:40.976 --> 00:34:44.060]  And that's what I really crave.
[00:34:45.022 --> 00:34:46.224]  What I really lust after.
[00:34:48.166 --> 00:34:48.687]  In a good way.
[00:34:48.707 --> 00:34:50.790]  I know lust is a sin, but you know what I mean.
[00:34:51.431 --> 00:34:54.555]  Is reaching new people and warning them so they can't be preyed upon.
[00:34:55.216 --> 00:34:56.378]  There's a Facebook video.
[00:34:57.435 --> 00:34:57.795]  I don't
[00:35:16.385 --> 00:35:18.407]  Until the feed cut out because we were down in a canyon.
[00:35:18.847 --> 00:35:22.370]  I talked to about 30 or more people telling them, read the vaccine insert.
[00:35:22.710 --> 00:35:26.973]  It's meant to brain damage you and your family, so they can then make money off of you once you get sick.
[00:35:27.413 --> 00:35:31.577]  The average doctor is compartmentalized and doesn't know this, but it's up to you to understand.
[00:35:32.337 --> 00:35:42.265]  And that act of resistance, if 5% of the public would do that neurotically and aggressively at least four or five times a week, I do it more than that.
[00:35:42.950 --> 00:35:43.710]  I'm on an elevator.
[00:35:43.730 --> 00:35:44.491]  I'm on an escalator.
[00:35:44.511 --> 00:35:45.531]  I'm in a checkout line.
[00:35:45.931 --> 00:35:47.011]  I'll say, hey, see this gum?
[00:35:47.332 --> 00:35:50.893]  Notice it doesn't say sugar-free, but on the back it's aspartame.
[00:35:51.753 --> 00:35:55.394]  In the monkey studies in the 70s, it didn't get approved because it killed monkeys.
[00:35:55.715 --> 00:35:58.075]  Look up Reese's Monkey Studies aspartame.
[00:35:58.095 --> 00:36:01.617]  They go, yeah, I chew gum, but aspartame's bad.
[00:36:01.637 --> 00:36:04.478]  I quit chewing that years ago.
[00:36:04.538 --> 00:36:06.458]  Yeah, my mom probably went blind from that.
[00:36:06.678 --> 00:36:07.579]  These are real conversations.
[00:36:07.599 --> 00:36:08.299]  I go, really?
[00:36:08.539 --> 00:36:09.299]  No, no, this has got it.
[00:36:09.379 --> 00:36:09.860]  No, it doesn't.
[00:36:09.880 --> 00:36:10.800]  I chew that very gum.
[00:36:12.092 --> 00:36:13.093]  $100.
[00:36:12.432 --> 00:36:13.093]  Just read the back.
[00:36:13.773 --> 00:36:15.194]  Sir, paper or plastic?
[00:36:16.414 --> 00:36:16.855]  Paper, please.
[00:36:17.495 --> 00:36:18.575]  Just do me a favor and look at the back.
[00:36:19.396 --> 00:36:21.157]  Well, it really does say Aspartame.
[00:36:22.858 --> 00:36:29.221]  So, if that's somebody I can help, number one, I'm helping somebody.
[00:36:29.241 --> 00:36:30.581]  Number two, I'm frustrating the globalist.
[00:36:30.962 --> 00:36:33.323]  Number three, at a mojo level,
[00:36:34.764 --> 00:36:37.286]  It gets my mojo right in.
[00:36:38.367 --> 00:36:40.870]  I gotta keep on riding, riding.
[00:36:40.950 --> 00:36:41.991]  It makes me feel good.
[00:36:42.031 --> 00:36:44.993]  My soul goes, man, I like this.
[00:36:46.064 --> 00:36:51.408]  I can feel my God-fear subdue a little bit when I do the right thing.
[00:36:51.808 --> 00:36:53.309]  It's like, yes, now you're doing it.
[00:36:53.369 --> 00:36:54.190]  Now you're aggressive.
[00:36:54.250 --> 00:36:54.970]  Now you're warning them.
[00:36:55.211 --> 00:36:56.491]  Now you're doing what you were made to do.
[00:36:56.812 --> 00:36:57.852]  Now you're becoming a man.
[00:36:57.993 --> 00:36:58.393]  Good!
[00:36:58.713 --> 00:36:59.073]  Good!
[00:36:59.734 --> 00:37:00.114]  Good!
[00:37:00.394 --> 00:37:10.962]  Do this more, I'll take you to the top and have you face down the enemy, and then you can be destroyed right in front of the world like so many other people will, and in that we will defeat the globalists.
[00:37:11.342 --> 00:37:13.844]  Don't think the globalists don't metaphysically know all of this.
[00:37:16.266 --> 00:37:18.228]  So, we're not stopping, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:37:18.288 --> 00:37:19.209]  We know the mission.
[00:37:19.729 --> 00:37:21.171]  The enemy knows we're not crazy.
[00:37:21.211 --> 00:37:24.474]  They know we're aware of their hair-on-fire evil.
[00:37:25.915 --> 00:37:29.178]  We are aware of what they're possessed by, what they're driven by.
[00:37:29.238 --> 00:37:30.399]  We're driven by something else.
[00:37:30.840 --> 00:37:35.304]  We are filled by something that's the opposite of what they're filled by.
[00:37:35.324 --> 00:37:39.048]  I want to shift gears on the big story I was ranting about.
[00:37:39.946 --> 00:37:58.015]  When I see giant trains of people from Central and South America pouring in by the millions, Mexico won't take them, and I see these people being paid for by taxpayer money when the globalists are exempt from it to bankrupt us, I realize a lot of these are good people.
[00:37:58.355 --> 00:38:02.657]  But I also realize a lot of them are bad people, and the globalists are using my concern
[00:38:03.860 --> 00:38:14.431]  Using my empathy against me to bring down the West, to shut off our infrastructure, to shut off our jobs, to shut off our power plants, to create so much red tape we can't operate.
[00:38:14.711 --> 00:38:22.659]  This is just cherry on the top of Obamacare, and the cost of business, and the screw jobs, and everything that's happened.
[00:38:24.621 --> 00:38:25.602]  And then I see Europe.
[00:38:28.336 --> 00:38:29.257]  Remember this article?
[00:38:29.557 --> 00:38:32.881]  ISIS operatives, thousands of jihadists have infiltrated Europe.
[00:38:33.182 --> 00:38:42.933]  They said that months ago that they would use the giant immigrant flow and quote 500,000 that they were going to send into the United States.
[00:38:43.013 --> 00:38:44.495]  There's the flashback.
[00:38:46.135 --> 00:38:55.142]  ISIS threatens to send 500,000 migrants to Europe as a psychological weapon in chilling echo of Qaddafi's prophecy that the Mediterranean will become a sea of chaos.
[00:38:55.923 --> 00:38:58.224]  That was the plan to bring down Qaddafi.
[00:38:58.545 --> 00:39:01.227]  That was the plan to make that a failed state.
[00:39:04.249 --> 00:39:06.511]  And this is what we broke down months ago.
[00:39:06.791 --> 00:39:10.434]  ISIS came out months ago and said that they were going to do this.
[00:39:12.677 --> 00:39:16.400]  Migrants flow west of Hungary, trains.
[00:39:16.420 --> 00:39:18.301]  13,000 reach Austria just today.
[00:39:19.382 --> 00:39:20.943]  Islam's conquest of Europe.
[00:39:21.223 --> 00:39:25.226]  This is but the beginning of what is to come if Europe does not pull up the drawbridge.
[00:39:25.826 --> 00:39:36.694]  But the drawbridge is run by the papa, who's a socialist, who wants world taxes, who wants carbon taxes, and who says it's your job to pay for all the illegals.
[00:39:40.615 --> 00:39:51.843]  And again, you can just go to YouTube and type in, migrants, you gotta put the political correct word in, rob trucks at French Ferry.
[00:39:51.943 --> 00:40:01.730]  I mean, there's just hundreds of these videos, where they had to shut the ferries and shut it all down, because the government was letting them get on the trucks and come in, but oh, no, they were robbing the trucks, then there were insurance claims.
[00:40:01.950 --> 00:40:03.491]  They were commandeering the trucks.
[00:40:05.615 --> 00:40:23.391]  And when you see the arrogance of these people, let's play the cussing and the Allah Akbar chants as they arrive, and this is not being broadcast by the television networks, but it is getting out.
[00:40:23.831 --> 00:40:26.914]  Muslim refugees in Budapest chanted Allah Akbar and F.U.
[00:40:27.174 --> 00:40:31.518]  while others in Italy attacked an old lady and threw feces at bystanders in Germany.
[00:40:31.758 --> 00:40:32.499]  Let's go to this clip.
[00:40:33.759 --> 00:40:36.180]  There is no culture in the West
[00:40:57.386 --> 00:40:58.267]  There is nothing.
[00:40:58.327 --> 00:41:00.228]  There is nothing but submission to tyranny.
[00:41:00.868 --> 00:41:05.351]  Our national anthem, our national symbol is now an aging transvestite.
[00:41:06.452 --> 00:41:10.514]  They're openly saying the word father and mother cannot be used in schools nationwide.
[00:41:11.355 --> 00:41:12.836]  Physical sports are being banned.
[00:41:12.916 --> 00:41:14.236]  Our total enslavement is here.
[00:41:14.797 --> 00:41:24.703]  And then, huge third world populations in hardcore streets from street fighting and bazaars are just arriving and conquering.
[00:41:26.932 --> 00:41:32.396]  And Germany bans demonstrations by mainline parties against the open borders.
[00:41:32.916 --> 00:41:33.997]  No free speech for you!
[00:41:37.759 --> 00:41:38.860]  Migrant crisis.
[00:41:38.920 --> 00:41:46.244]  Pakistan and others dumping IDs to become Syrian after the West blew up Syria.
[00:41:47.045 --> 00:41:49.366]  Greek island overwhelmed by stranded migrants.
[00:41:49.386 --> 00:41:49.847]  Despair.
[00:41:50.307 --> 00:41:53.209]  Island transformed by sudden new population of some 20,000 refugees.
[00:41:53.229 --> 00:41:53.269]  AP.
[00:41:57.267 --> 00:42:01.210]  The real refugee problem, how to solve it, Ron Paul, stop being an empire.
[00:42:01.770 --> 00:42:04.152]  Stop meddling in affairs, but that's the globalist plan.
[00:42:05.453 --> 00:42:10.437]  Germany faces massive anti-migrant versus pro-migrant standoff amid refugee crisis.
[00:42:11.017 --> 00:42:18.062]  White House actively considering approaches to bring in millions of illegals, CNS News, from the Middle East.
[00:42:18.903 --> 00:42:21.244]  Migration of populations versus the individual.
[00:42:21.264 --> 00:42:24.387]  That's right, they have rights to come here and have everything paid for.
[00:42:25.560 --> 00:42:27.782]  But you don't have a right as an individual not to pay for it.
[00:42:30.584 --> 00:42:34.747]  Germany is exploiting refugee suffering to recruit slaves via mass immigration.
[00:42:34.767 --> 00:42:35.928]  Yes, to drive down wages.
[00:42:35.948 --> 00:42:37.409]  That's RT, breaking it down.
[00:42:37.429 --> 00:42:38.810]  That's Le Pen.
[00:42:40.291 --> 00:42:44.234]  From this point forward, Christians are going to be banned from holding many jobs in America.
[00:42:44.874 --> 00:42:47.536]  The American Dream, Michael Snyder, Infowars.com.
[00:42:47.797 --> 00:42:52.180]  It's now being announced as Christians are arrested all over the place for not submitting.
[00:42:53.643 --> 00:42:57.187]  Video of Muslim refugees arriving in Europe makes a throat-cutting gesture.
[00:42:57.207 --> 00:43:02.092]  I mean, you look at the crazed hatred, because these people are real insecure.
[00:43:02.513 --> 00:43:03.995]  They hate the West, a lot of them.
[00:43:04.495 --> 00:43:07.038]  Now they're really poor, but they're prideful and they feel bad.
[00:43:07.058 --> 00:43:09.401]  So all they can do is just go, get it all to me!
[00:43:10.435 --> 00:43:16.838]  And then the left shows up with paramilitary police and goes, yes, here's your card, here's your welfare, here's your job, we salute you.
[00:43:17.339 --> 00:43:21.481]  Gates going down the sacking of Europe.
[00:43:21.661 --> 00:43:27.444]  The globalists are evacuating to armored redoubts right now, preparing the global collapse, preparing for the breakdown of society.
[00:43:27.464 --> 00:43:32.807]  We're going to go to Paul Watson here in a moment, but my headpiece just broke.
[00:43:33.247 --> 00:43:34.608]  So bring me in another one, please.
[00:43:34.668 --> 00:43:37.570]  I just unplugged that one on average on accident.
[00:43:37.590 --> 00:43:37.910]  Thank you.
[00:43:39.059 --> 00:43:45.645]  But as you can see, I'm particularly crazed today because this is the reality of what's happening.
[00:43:46.286 --> 00:43:50.890]  And then I look at all the other news, all the other things that are happening.
[00:43:50.990 --> 00:43:51.291]  U.S.
[00:43:51.311 --> 00:43:56.796]  demands Greece close airspace to Russian humanitarian aid for Syria when they're only flying them in food.
[00:43:57.536 --> 00:44:01.080]  And Russia's doing us a favor, trying to keep all the refugees from coming here.
[00:44:02.847 --> 00:44:06.509]  And by the way, Al Qaeda controls two-thirds of the country roughly, ISIS does.
[00:44:06.969 --> 00:44:13.012]  So this is their people now coming in who couldn't beat Assad and couldn't get a couple of the major cities to loot.
[00:44:13.755 --> 00:44:16.517]  It's admitted they're from Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, you name it.
[00:44:16.537 --> 00:44:17.738]  They're jihad fighters.
[00:44:18.378 --> 00:44:21.400]  And so now they're coming in to the West.
[00:44:22.301 --> 00:44:23.421]  And it is going to be fun.
[00:44:23.501 --> 00:44:31.207]  Welfare cards, everything free, in the public schools and colleges, beating up your children, and the police will do nothing.
[00:44:31.607 --> 00:44:32.407]  It is a gift.
[00:44:35.256 --> 00:44:41.598]  It is an absolute gift to be assaulted and attacked if you're in the West by some of these folks.
[00:44:41.919 --> 00:44:45.200]  So you will find out how wonderful it is to be a slave.
[00:44:45.300 --> 00:44:46.460]  This is the plan.
[00:44:47.521 --> 00:44:50.442]  And it's the very same program and plan here as well.
[00:44:50.782 --> 00:44:55.724]  Again, 10,000 Chinese women a week come here to the United States.
[00:44:58.137 --> 00:44:59.498]  To have their babies for free.
[00:44:59.558 --> 00:45:02.380]  It's advertised in Chinese newspapers and on TV and CNN.
[00:45:02.440 --> 00:45:07.883]  It says what a great opportunity it is and runs specials about how wonderful it is and how we should do it.
[00:45:08.324 --> 00:45:21.672]  Really, but the IRS, if you're an American that's Asian or white or Hispanic or black, will take your grandmother's house or will take your house if you get sick and can't pay the taxes or can't pay the local property taxes.
[00:45:21.912 --> 00:45:22.513]  They will take it.
[00:45:22.753 --> 00:45:24.074]  Where's the compassion for you?
[00:45:25.776 --> 00:45:31.039]  Where's the compassion for people that can't pay the five or six tickets they've gotten over the years because they're a single mother?
[00:45:31.979 --> 00:45:41.063]  But then the police come and have no refusal weekends or roundup weekends where they come to your house and arrest tens of thousands in each town and take you and fill the jails to suck money out of you.
[00:45:46.406 --> 00:45:48.507]  So, that's what it comes down to.
[00:45:48.587 --> 00:45:50.328]  Then after Paul Watson leaves us,
[00:45:53.587 --> 00:45:58.009]  And you know, I'm just bucking around like a bull so much today that I just broke this one too.
[00:45:58.770 --> 00:46:01.291]  I've never even done this in all my years on air.
[00:46:01.651 --> 00:46:03.812]  I'm popping the headpiece out of the plug.
[00:46:03.852 --> 00:46:04.593]  I need those fixed.
[00:46:05.933 --> 00:46:06.914]  We just won't go to Watson.
[00:46:06.934 --> 00:46:07.494]  How's that sound?
[00:46:08.115 --> 00:46:10.056]  Because I'm down and I don't have a headpiece.
[00:46:10.776 --> 00:46:14.218]  I'm just so fired up that the cord is wrapped under here and I just broke another one.
[00:46:14.678 --> 00:46:18.440]  I mean, that's how hardcore all of this is getting.
[00:46:18.820 --> 00:46:22.282]  That's how serious all of this is getting and it's only going to intensify
[00:46:23.422 --> 00:46:28.004]  They're announcing executive actions to come after our guns.
[00:46:28.924 --> 00:46:34.186]  They are announcing all of these executive actions to come after our families, forced inoculations.
[00:46:34.486 --> 00:46:35.306]  We are pathetic.
[00:46:35.386 --> 00:46:36.226]  We are not men.
[00:46:36.466 --> 00:46:37.307]  We are slaves.
[00:46:37.567 --> 00:46:43.709]  We have gotten in this position by submitting to tyranny, by doing what we're told.
[00:46:44.509 --> 00:46:52.212]  Land of the Free, Home of the Brave is just a bunch of slaves who are absolutely committed to any form of enslavement they're ordered to be under.
[00:46:53.274 --> 00:46:58.276]  And that's why we've gotten to this point in this civilization, in this society.
[00:47:00.257 --> 00:47:07.741]  Then coming up, a Los Angeles plan to reshape the streetscape sets off fears of gridlock.
[00:47:09.461 --> 00:47:19.686]  And they go on to say, what we're trying to do is make congestion so bad you'll have to get out of your car, says James O'Sullivan, founder of Fix the City group, that is planning a lawsuit.
[00:47:20.667 --> 00:47:21.387]  Stop the plan.
[00:47:22.858 --> 00:47:27.882]  But what you are going to do, take two hours or a bus, they haven't given us the options.
[00:47:30.183 --> 00:47:45.175]  The City Council's approved a far-reaching transportation plan would reshape the cityscape over the next 20 years, adding hundreds of miles of bicycle lanes, bus-only lanes, pedestrian safety features, as part of an effort to nudge drivers, that's a key social conditioning word, out from behind the wheel.
[00:47:46.260 --> 00:47:52.881]  The major roads are only going to be for Democratic Party owned and Rahm Emanuel's brother basically owns Uber.
[00:47:53.361 --> 00:47:58.502]  The deals have already been made all over the world where they're going to take existing roads and only let Uber and Google operate on them.
[00:47:59.043 --> 00:48:01.883]  So a couple companies will have the franchise with driverless cars.
[00:48:01.903 --> 00:48:02.783]  It's all been announced.
[00:48:03.884 --> 00:48:05.964]  And then you will submit to all of it.
[00:48:06.144 --> 00:48:07.424]  We're going to Paul Watson in a moment.
[00:48:09.225 --> 00:48:10.945]  So this is the draconian plan.
[00:48:12.230 --> 00:48:13.530]  This is their operation.
[00:48:13.610 --> 00:48:28.474]  And again, space heaters, outdoor stoves, planting a tree, cutting a tree, making a cow pond, building a barn, having your children do chores, having the wrong kind of toilet or light bulbs, the wrong kind of paint.
[00:48:28.874 --> 00:48:30.194]  This is the Green Police.
[00:48:30.674 --> 00:48:31.834]  This is Agenda 21 World Treaty.
[00:48:34.687 --> 00:48:42.232]  To run every facet of your life selectively where you go bankrupt and only the globalists can operate because they have exemptions to all of it.
[00:48:43.512 --> 00:48:48.555]  Or they have it built in with their plans and mitigation plans to only have to submit to part of it.
[00:48:51.657 --> 00:48:52.338]  So it's on.
[00:48:52.698 --> 00:48:59.462]  Single family homes, I told you in the Obama deception six years ago, seven years ago, would be banned in Europe and the U.S.
[00:48:59.482 --> 00:49:01.183]  They're already being banned in Europe under zoning.
[00:49:01.423 --> 00:49:02.364]  You cannot get a permit.
[00:49:03.208 --> 00:49:12.892]  And they're now being banned in Seattle and in San Francisco and other areas because they want to charge you more for less.
[00:49:14.912 --> 00:49:18.694]  They will fly above the city in helicopters or in aircraft.
[00:49:18.874 --> 00:49:21.035]  You will be a slave.
[00:49:21.135 --> 00:49:23.075]  You will have your resources taken.
[00:49:23.515 --> 00:49:30.238]  Paul Watson's going to break down what Pat Buchanan calls Islam's conquest of Europe.
[00:49:31.394 --> 00:49:35.397]  But Europe already committed suicide having 1.3 children on average.
[00:49:37.038 --> 00:49:38.619]  But then the criminals that run Europe...
[00:49:39.670 --> 00:49:45.733]  They destabilized the Middle East to now bring these people in and to show you little dead kids that have drowned coming out of Libya.
[00:49:46.374 --> 00:49:53.038]  When our government did that, they won't show you the hundreds of thousands killed all over the place from Syria to Libya that the globalists helped murder.
[00:49:53.578 --> 00:50:01.182]  But they'll show you an individual child and say, it's your job, even though not a single Middle Eastern country will take a single one of these people.
[00:50:02.963 --> 00:50:05.745]  Now, before I go to break, I have some very exciting news.
[00:50:07.136 --> 00:50:08.757]  I sat out at Infowarslife.com.
[00:50:08.897 --> 00:50:11.617]  I'm going to skip this network break because I've held Watson.
[00:50:13.958 --> 00:50:23.421]  I have come out, going to the main top manufacturers of organic nutraceuticals, to not private label but create our own brand.
[00:50:23.441 --> 00:50:30.263]  I tell you what, I'm going to show people what I'm talking about right here, of knockout.
[00:50:31.821 --> 00:50:40.525]  And Knockout has 10 different ingredients in it, known to have you sleep good, to have good REM sleep, and it's just amazing.
[00:50:40.545 --> 00:50:42.146]  That's why we call it Knockout.
[00:50:43.007 --> 00:50:53.912]  It's got the hops flower extract, lemon balm extract, valerian root extract, chamomile flower extract, L-tryptophan, melatonin, gamba,
[00:50:56.295 --> 00:50:59.458]  And other key ingredients known.
[00:51:00.379 --> 00:51:02.741]  If you just take melatonin here and there, it'll still work.
[00:51:02.761 --> 00:51:04.082]  But if you take it all the time, it doesn't work anymore.
[00:51:04.422 --> 00:51:14.170]  You take all this together, amazing sleep, amazing sleep on an airplane, you name it, and your purchase helps fund this operation.
[00:51:16.292 --> 00:51:23.118]  Your purchase of Knockout that's been sold out for two, three months, we finally got a whole bunch of it in,
[00:51:24.500 --> 00:51:25.801]  Helps fund this operation.
[00:51:25.841 --> 00:51:28.362]  It has amazing reviews on the site.
[00:51:28.882 --> 00:51:31.504]  You're not groggy in the morning because it's all natural.
[00:51:34.846 --> 00:51:35.886]  It really is amazing.
[00:51:35.926 --> 00:51:36.807]  It's a game changer.
[00:51:37.227 --> 00:51:39.749]  And your purchase of Knockout at InfoWarsLive.com.
[00:51:41.560 --> 00:51:42.100]  We're good to go.
[00:52:04.431 --> 00:52:06.892]  And the rest of it, the standards are just so high.
[00:52:06.992 --> 00:52:09.212]  So Liver Shield will sell out today.
[00:52:09.673 --> 00:52:12.833]  We have the Deep Cleanse will probably sell out this week.
[00:52:12.893 --> 00:52:14.374]  We should have more of that in a couple weeks.
[00:52:14.834 --> 00:52:18.455]  So Deep Cleanse and Liver Cleanse, InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:52:18.475 --> 00:52:20.636]  I want to thank you all for your support or 888-253-3139.
[00:52:25.197 --> 00:52:27.058]  That's 888-253-3139.

[00:53:35.362 --> 00:53:37.203]  So that's what it comes down to.
[00:53:51.832 --> 00:53:54.473]  For prison t-shirts are also very, very popular.
[00:53:54.533 --> 00:53:56.154]  That helps spread the word, so thank you all.
[00:53:56.474 --> 00:54:01.876]  Hillary for prison, 2016 on the front, on the back, Legalize Freedom, InfoWars.com.
[00:54:01.896 --> 00:54:03.917]  It's a very handsome election shirt.
[00:54:04.037 --> 00:54:07.218]  I personally have already worn it out and gotten a lot of positive comments.
[00:54:07.638 --> 00:54:14.141]  I intend to walk around downtown the next few days wearing one and see what folks think about that in some of the trendy areas.
[00:54:14.841 --> 00:54:21.064]  I'm going to ask him if we should put all the gun owners in FEMA camps, like we've done already, and the majority of them do say it's time for slave camps.
[00:54:21.404 --> 00:54:22.005]  We have it on video.
[00:54:22.545 --> 00:54:23.265]  Time for slave camps.
[00:54:24.086 --> 00:54:25.647]  So very, very serious situation.
[00:54:26.447 --> 00:54:30.089]  We're doing Facebook mentions right now as well in here.
[00:54:30.849 --> 00:54:34.211]  We're about to go to Paul Joseph Watson, who I appreciate holding.
[00:54:36.127 --> 00:54:51.298]  I don't think I've ever been more crazed, more upset, more sure of myself that everything we talked about is now coming true and that we are in the absolute hands of psychopathic criminals that have a death wish towards the West and the engine of freedom and prosperity and true liberalism.
[00:54:51.918 --> 00:54:58.523]  I mean, banning father and mother, opening the borders up, saying it's our job to pay for any illegal from anywhere in the world.
[00:55:00.485 --> 00:55:01.866]  It is just too evil.
[00:55:02.526 --> 00:55:04.808]  While all these countries in the Middle East
[00:55:06.365 --> 00:55:13.511]  Are taking in zero of the people, and it's Saudi Arabia launching the attacks in Libya and Syria that are bringing in the refugees.
[00:55:14.251 --> 00:55:21.757]  The very culprits guilty of it, the radical Islamicists, joke and say, we're doing this to destabilize you two months ago.
[00:55:21.777 --> 00:55:23.519]  I mean, pull that up.
[00:55:23.679 --> 00:55:28.102]  ISIS says they're sending 500,000 migrants with sleeper cells.
[00:55:28.905 --> 00:55:32.426]  That was in the Associated Press two months ago, and now it's here.
[00:55:33.086 --> 00:55:41.489]  And the leftists who want voters and divide and conquer in race-based politics are saying we must accept all these people.
[00:55:41.809 --> 00:55:44.930]  Paul Joseph Watson's article is on DrudgeReport.com.
[00:55:45.230 --> 00:55:46.510]  Paul, thank you for joining us.
[00:55:46.790 --> 00:55:53.232]  I know you traveled to Czech Republic where they halted westbound trains just last week to research this yourself.
[00:55:53.552 --> 00:55:56.233]  Investigative journalist Paul Watson, thank you for coming on with us.
[00:55:57.329 --> 00:55:57.789]  Hi Alex.
[00:55:58.350 --> 00:56:03.654]  Yeah, Czech Republic was interesting because they've had the same population for a hundred years.
[00:56:03.734 --> 00:56:06.796]  They've had the same population of around 10 million since 1910.
[00:56:07.697 --> 00:56:10.679]  Now the standard of living is very high.
[00:56:10.839 --> 00:56:15.003]  Prague is a very nice city, but the cost of living is still quite low.
[00:56:15.403 --> 00:56:17.785]  And they've basically got very limited immigration.
[00:56:18.205 --> 00:56:23.969]  So all the people you see working in the restaurants and the bars, you know, the minimarts, the 7-Elevens, whatever,
[00:56:24.750 --> 00:56:31.473]  They're all Czech citizens, because they've limited mass immigration, but they still have a thriving economy.
[00:56:31.913 --> 00:56:46.239]  So it puts to bed this myth that you need mass immigration just to make an economy work, because, you know, the housing is quite low, young people can get on the housing ladder, and it's a thriving economy, and it's got low immigration.
[00:56:46.339 --> 00:56:48.040]  So again, it completely puts that on the bed.
[00:56:48.060 --> 00:56:50.061]  Just like Switzerland, just like Australia.
[00:56:51.274 --> 00:56:57.733]  Yeah, but now what we're seeing in Germany, and in fact, Angela Merkel came out in a rare moment of truth yesterday.
[00:56:58.973 --> 00:57:10.025]  Bearing in mind, you know, 800,000 of these, quote, refugees, which we'll talk about in a minute, most of them aren't even refugees, 800,000 into Germany before the end of this year.
[00:57:10.605 --> 00:57:21.717]  This morning they came out and said another 500,000 every single year, on top of all their other immigration, for an undetermined period way off into the future.
[00:57:22.257 --> 00:57:27.500]  One German town, the New York Times reported, went from 1,000 to 3,000 people in one week.
[00:57:28.001 --> 00:57:32.403]  One picturesque town with 2,000 North Africans squatting in it.
[00:57:33.984 --> 00:57:42.249]  Yeah, so Merkel said, quote, what we are experiencing now is something that will occupy and change our country in coming years.
[00:57:42.709 --> 00:57:44.370]  So they're just throwing the gauntlet down.
[00:57:44.430 --> 00:57:45.511]  You will be dominated.
[00:57:45.771 --> 00:57:46.811]  You will be assimilated.
[00:57:46.831 --> 00:57:47.532]  This is insane.
[00:57:48.800 --> 00:57:50.721]  Yeah, and then I put out a tweet.
[00:57:50.841 --> 00:58:02.166]  There was this German politician, I think he's in the government actually, basically smacking his lips and laughing about how, quote, every year more native Germans die than there are born.
[00:58:02.567 --> 00:58:07.229]  And then he goes on to say, oh, that's because the Nazis were really bad at having children.
[00:58:07.469 --> 00:58:08.730]  Of course they're not the Nazis.
[00:58:08.770 --> 00:58:10.490]  The Nazis were a political party.
[00:58:10.791 --> 00:58:13.432]  He's talking about the host German population.
[00:58:14.052 --> 00:58:16.714]  No, the culture of Germany is now self-hating.
[00:58:17.194 --> 00:58:32.704]  When the West set up Hitler, put him in power, the Rockefellers financed him, he had a peace treaty with England, they set the Germans up, 20 million Germans died, terrible, the Nazis were horrible, but the truth is, the Germans fought the whole world, nobody's ever fought that hard.
[00:58:33.364 --> 00:58:40.089]  The Russians were almost on par with them, and it's a disgraceful, self-hating, dirtbag, filth, piece of crap.
[00:58:40.689 --> 00:58:42.330]  Who hates Western culture.
[00:58:42.670 --> 00:58:43.431]  Stay there, Paul.
[00:58:43.751 --> 00:58:44.511]  We'll be right back.

[00:59:52.112 --> 00:59:55.274]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:00:15.717 --> 01:00:19.860]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:20.540 --> 01:00:21.341]  You want answers?
[01:00:22.121 --> 01:00:23.042]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:23.682 --> 01:00:27.305]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:27.865 --> 01:00:31.968]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:32.468 --> 01:00:40.394]  Americans and Westerners have been more free than other nations because we were willing to fight for basic human freedom and we didn't have pure monopolies.
[01:00:40.554 --> 01:00:42.195]  We started breaking those up 560 years ago or so.
[01:00:45.006 --> 01:00:52.573]  That's why the globalists who are monopoly men, and mainly Europeans, seek to pull up the ladder that's made the technology and the wealth that's helped the planet.
[01:00:53.114 --> 01:01:01.601]  Many wonderful cultures around the world, but the most impoverished, collapsing, barbarous, anti-politically correct countries in the world.
[01:01:02.495 --> 01:01:08.660]  Are now being brought in and told, keep your culture, the West has to give its laissez-faire, open culture up.
[01:01:09.220 --> 01:01:17.606]  For the rest of this segment, and the next, because Paul Watson held for 20 minutes earlier while I was ranting, I'm going to shut up and give my eloquent colleague the floor.
[01:01:18.086 --> 01:01:23.550]  Paul, spend four minutes on what's coming up, you will host the next 12 minutes, because I want you to lay all your intel out.
[01:01:24.031 --> 01:01:26.693]  But I mean, do you not feel in your bones the ancient
[01:01:27.273 --> 01:01:33.542]  Feeling of being overwritten, being enslaved, being conquered with these globalist socialists smacking their lips.
[01:01:33.582 --> 01:01:35.925]  I mean, does it not physically animate you?
[01:01:35.945 --> 01:01:39.069]  Well, precisely because...
[01:01:40.086 --> 01:01:46.928]  The only countries that get, you know, mass multiculturalism imposed on them are white Western countries.
[01:01:47.308 --> 01:01:50.869]  It's racist not to celebrate the cultures of other countries.
[01:01:51.749 --> 01:01:54.150]  But it's also racist to celebrate your own culture.
[01:01:54.170 --> 01:02:03.093]  In fact, in Sweden, they basically now say that if you don't embrace these other cultures, if you do celebrate your own inherent culture, that's racist.
[01:02:03.153 --> 01:02:07.154]  People have been charged with hate crimes for being critical of Islam.
[01:02:07.694 --> 01:02:15.203]  Also in the UK, Paul Weston, the leader of Liberty GB, he was arrested on the street for reading out a Winston Churchill quote.
[01:02:15.883 --> 01:02:25.634]  You've got Tommy Robinson, who's basically the British version of Pamela Gellar, merely planning to attend a meeting about having a draw Mohammed cartoon contest.
[01:02:26.435 --> 01:02:30.017]  Put back in prison by police to prevent him from doing that.
[01:02:30.057 --> 01:02:36.101]  So merely, you know, the thought crime of planning to offend Muslims gets you scooped up by the police.
[01:02:36.461 --> 01:02:38.362]  And then again, look at what's happening in Germany.
[01:02:38.983 --> 01:02:43.045]  There's a school in Germany that's situated right next to a migrant camp.
[01:02:43.385 --> 01:02:48.549]  The head teacher wrote a letter to the parents of the teenage girls at that school saying,
[01:02:49.249 --> 01:02:58.355]  You're not allowed to wear miniskirts because that might offend the migrant and lead to them attacking you and raping you.
[01:02:58.855 --> 01:03:03.518]  So again, we have to adapt to them, they don't have to adapt to us.
[01:03:03.978 --> 01:03:09.221]  And these barbarous behaviours which we talked about in the last segment are going to be imposed upon us.
[01:03:09.742 --> 01:03:13.064]  And there's in fact people on Twitter contacting me today saying,
[01:03:13.504 --> 01:03:14.564]  Yeah, I live in Germany.
[01:03:14.604 --> 01:03:24.488]  My family says they're telling the teen girls there at schools not to wear shorts because they might offend migrants that are moving into the area.
[01:03:24.508 --> 01:03:27.790]  So again, it's all about their culture being imposed on us.
[01:03:28.310 --> 01:03:30.731]  And literally, there are German politicians saying,
[01:03:31.431 --> 01:03:38.553]  You know, the Nazis didn't have enough children, now the German people are dying out, as if that's a good thing!
[01:03:39.093 --> 01:03:44.115]  As if that's a reason why they need to admit 800,000 more migrants into the country.
[01:03:44.635 --> 01:03:53.418]  So, again, going back to the major point is, European citizens have spent the last two years voting against mass immigration.
[01:03:53.458 --> 01:03:57.799]  We've seen it in Sweden, Denmark, the United Kingdom and other countries.
[01:03:58.599 --> 01:04:01.921]  Again, threatening the power base of the European Union.
[01:04:02.401 --> 01:04:11.985]  So they rejected mass multiculturalism on a widespread basis and it was even rejected by people like Cameron and Merkel two, three years ago.
[01:04:12.045 --> 01:04:14.287]  So the EU just blows up the Middle East.
[01:04:15.765 --> 01:04:17.787]  So the Middle East... Go ahead.
[01:04:18.147 --> 01:04:18.668]  No, go ahead.
[01:04:18.708 --> 01:04:29.997]  No, I'm saying they bring it in via the back door, via this migrant crisis, which has been launched on photo ops that are completely misleading, which we can talk about after the break.
[01:04:30.518 --> 01:04:37.343]  And now 90% of the individuals in some of these areas that are coming in from these migrant countries
[01:04:38.004 --> 01:04:39.085]  Stay there, Paul.
[01:04:39.165 --> 01:04:40.546]  Paul can't hear me.
[01:04:40.626 --> 01:04:41.406]  That's what's happening.
[01:04:41.466 --> 01:04:42.987]  We're gonna come back with Paul.
[01:04:43.047 --> 01:04:43.368]  This is key.
[01:05:08.369 --> 01:05:08.511]  Yeah.
[01:05:11.209 --> 01:05:14.770]  ISIS has demanded that Syrian Christians pay an Islam tax.
[01:05:15.150 --> 01:05:17.370]  This is being reported by WorldNetDaily.
[01:05:18.090 --> 01:05:29.973]  ISIS terrorists gathered together dozens of Christian men in Syria and told them either to pay a Sharia-inspired tax and sign onto a list of faith-based restrictions or pay a penalty that could include the loss of life.
[01:05:30.593 --> 01:05:38.635]  Among the restrictions, Christians cannot own guns, build places of worship, show their crosses in public or even ring church bells.
[01:05:39.355 --> 01:05:46.839]  The terrorists put forth their demands to Christians in a town that used to be dominated by the Christian faith, but has been taken over by radical Muslims.
[01:05:47.539 --> 01:05:54.983]  And while many followers of Islam will condemn these actions, numerous people in power continue to fund groups like ISIS and Al Qaeda.
[01:05:55.723 --> 01:06:05.206]  Whether it's airdropping grenades or leaving behind billions of dollars worth of vehicles that they can use against us, these terrorist groups always seem to find the best equipment somewhere.

[01:08:04.093 --> 01:08:07.955]  I have been very honestly upset and hyperbolic today on air because I'm normal.
[01:08:38.235 --> 01:09:04.484]  I have been so incredibly upset by watching the globalists clearly launch a worldwide offensive against families, against private wealth, against private property, and against justice, and candy coat the cyanide pill as sweet and cute political correctness.
[01:09:06.172 --> 01:09:17.442]  The West went in the last five years, destabilized Africa, destabilized the Middle East, tried to kick out our allies in Egypt, tried to take down Assad, took out Gaddafi.
[01:09:18.103 --> 01:09:23.468]  Saudi Arabia funded a radical jihad invasion to radicalize the entire area.
[01:09:24.972 --> 01:09:37.645]  Al Qaeda two months ago said, all over the news, we pulled the articles up last hour, we're going to send 500,000 quote migrants, using the political correct term, to your countries and inside of them send jihadists.
[01:09:38.807 --> 01:09:40.809]  Then when they attack, which they started doing,
[01:09:42.608 --> 01:09:52.412]  Those Western countries can take the general public's liberties at checkpoints and at the TSA style facilities in the name of protecting you.
[01:09:52.952 --> 01:09:54.913]  And now we just showed the headlines last hour.
[01:09:55.313 --> 01:10:00.415]  German newspapers don't wear shorts or miniskirts in public.
[01:10:00.875 --> 01:10:02.996]  You may make the migrants unhappy.
[01:10:03.396 --> 01:10:10.619]  Oh, these people that are here illegally that are carjacking things and taking over ferries and trucks and raping and killing people.
[01:10:10.979 --> 01:10:12.160]  Oh, you don't like it?
[01:10:13.151 --> 01:10:14.963]  That my wife's wearing a short skirt?
[01:10:15.083 --> 01:10:15.868]  Go to hell!
[01:10:17.370 --> 01:10:26.176]  Oh, you don't, see, and it's the left pushing all this, oh, be inclusive, give up your rights, because you hurt someone else.
[01:10:26.856 --> 01:10:32.260]  And they know if they can tell us, don't say the word boy or girl, or father or mother, or husband and wife.
[01:10:32.940 --> 01:10:40.926]  See, first a few years ago it was in government documents, now it's in colleges, it's in schools, and it's in colleges now if you say, yeah, my wife and I are going to dinner tonight.
[01:10:41.246 --> 01:10:45.789]  Whoa, that might hurt somebody, you say the word wife, because you have a wife, you're bad!
[01:10:48.444 --> 01:11:00.247]  And you go, who are these people living in the lap of luxury, the lap of laissez-faire liberalism, true liberalism that lets them live like this, saying you're going to accept radical Muslims in your town.
[01:11:02.047 --> 01:11:03.808]  Because they hate the West.
[01:11:04.648 --> 01:11:13.770]  The socialists have combined with giant third world populations, same things happening here with open borders, to bring the country and the world down.
[01:11:14.030 --> 01:11:15.350]  This is a set plan.
[01:11:16.251 --> 01:11:17.771]  I want to play the clip from the article
[01:11:19.275 --> 01:11:21.056]  That's up on DrudgeReport.com.
[01:11:21.376 --> 01:11:27.581]  Paul Joseph Watson's article, of course, originates at PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[01:11:28.722 --> 01:11:29.702]  And there's other videos.
[01:11:29.742 --> 01:11:33.045]  Muslim refugees arriving in Europe makes cut the throat to the cameraman.
[01:11:33.065 --> 01:11:34.506]  There's this crazed look of hate.
[01:11:35.555 --> 01:11:41.340]  And then we have the other video, Muslim refugees chant Allah Akbar, FU, attack citizens, throw feces.
[01:11:42.061 --> 01:11:42.721]  This is it.
[01:11:42.861 --> 01:11:51.489]  And if they can get millions of illegals here a year and millions into Europe, 800,000 so far this year in Germany alone, the sky is the bloody limit.
[01:11:53.971 --> 01:12:01.338]  And it's not just bring in people and then put them on welfare, it's say to the public, you must submit to them.
[01:12:05.506 --> 01:12:15.236]  Now let's go ahead and again it's like this weird twisted radical Islamic thing with a socialist icing where they're all entitled and angry and you're going to give me everything.
[01:12:15.536 --> 01:12:16.197]  It's so sick.
[01:12:16.557 --> 01:12:23.864]  Let's go ahead now and go to this clip of them screaming Allah Akbar and the cuss words are cut out.
[01:12:23.904 --> 01:12:24.225]  Here it is.
[01:12:26.983 --> 01:12:29.144]  God is great!
[01:12:29.184 --> 01:12:29.924]  God is great!
[01:12:56.512 --> 01:13:08.483]  Alright, now we have another one of a large crowd saying it and F-bombs and F-everybody and throwing feces, but we can't play it because there's so many F-words.
[01:13:09.344 --> 01:13:11.325]  That it would just be unintelligible.
[01:13:11.385 --> 01:13:15.168]  Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, if we did this.
[01:13:15.848 --> 01:13:24.834]  But imagine in major cities, hundreds of thousands in your town, in small towns, double your number, running around, screaming, demanding everything.
[01:13:26.175 --> 01:13:37.598]  And then just beating people up, carjacking, with the loving liberal media going, how dear, how sweet, behave yourself, roll out the red carpet, and the same thing's being done here.
[01:13:37.958 --> 01:13:42.960]  And Donald Trump says there's a lot of criminals fleeing justice in Latin America coming up here, which is a fact.
[01:13:43.280 --> 01:13:44.400]  They're like, how dare you!
[01:13:44.420 --> 01:13:47.482]  How dare you not take forced inoculations!
[01:13:47.782 --> 01:13:49.802]  How dare you use the word mother or father!
[01:13:50.183 --> 01:13:51.863]  How dare you have a fireplace!
[01:13:52.223 --> 01:13:54.164]  How dare you have the wrong light bulbs!
[01:13:54.384 --> 01:13:56.105]  How dare you have the wrong toilet!
[01:13:56.405 --> 01:13:58.426]  How dare you spank your children!
[01:13:58.626 --> 01:14:00.066]  How dare you go to church!
[01:14:00.426 --> 01:14:03.107]  How dare you not fill out the gay marriage license!
[01:14:03.468 --> 01:14:04.448]  How dare you!
[01:14:04.468 --> 01:14:05.688]  How dare you!
[01:14:06.249 --> 01:14:09.050]  And you know, the brother of Madonna came out who's gay,
[01:14:09.890 --> 01:14:12.531]  And the gay rights activists have said, man, this is real tyranny.
[01:14:13.231 --> 01:14:14.512]  Some other clerk would do that.
[01:14:14.572 --> 01:14:16.313]  We need to let people have their religious views.
[01:14:16.333 --> 01:14:17.293]  He goes, it's weird.
[01:14:17.333 --> 01:14:21.155]  He goes, no one makes Muslims take their headdresses off when they fly.
[01:14:21.175 --> 01:14:22.035]  Everybody else has to.
[01:14:23.096 --> 01:14:26.457]  And he goes, this is the country that allows people to be free.
[01:14:26.537 --> 01:14:27.457]  What's going on here?
[01:14:28.578 --> 01:14:31.359]  We have to let someone for their religious views do something like that.
[01:14:33.100 --> 01:14:35.441]  Because, you know, there are gay people out there that aren't tyrants.
[01:14:37.791 --> 01:14:43.316]  Why does the gay community want to teach our five-year-olds how to be girls if they're boys?
[01:14:44.016 --> 01:14:45.797]  Because it's all just psychological warfare.
[01:14:46.178 --> 01:14:47.459]  It's all setting the precedent.
[01:14:47.819 --> 01:14:49.380]  You can do whatever you want, however you want.
[01:14:49.400 --> 01:14:52.583]  Now, Paul Watson, you've got six minutes in this segment, six in the next.
[01:14:52.643 --> 01:14:53.484]  You've got the floor.
[01:14:54.184 --> 01:14:57.445]  I want you to start over and break down how huge this is.
[01:14:57.985 --> 01:15:11.647]  But undoubtedly, do you concur with me that the globalists on financial collapse, economic warfare, open borders, globalism, they have decided, because their program's failing, to just drop the hammer with total criminality.
[01:15:11.987 --> 01:15:16.788]  The Pope lecturing everyone to take illegals into your homes, but he won't take them into his home.
[01:15:17.168 --> 01:15:19.768]  I mean, they are making their move, Paul.
[01:15:20.108 --> 01:15:20.829]  If we take in 800,000 in just
[01:15:23.029 --> 01:15:29.493]  It's nine months into Germany alone, three million into Europe, half a million in the UK this year we know of.
[01:15:29.873 --> 01:15:32.915]  It sets the precedent and then encourages the next wave.
[01:15:33.175 --> 01:15:35.056]  The last wave was a couple hundred thousand.
[01:15:35.316 --> 01:15:36.057]  Now it's millions.
[01:15:36.277 --> 01:15:37.698]  The next is going to be ten millions.
[01:15:38.098 --> 01:15:41.980]  And the police stand down as they take over the trains, as they take over the ships.
[01:15:42.321 --> 01:15:45.362]  Everyone salutes, loads them on and brings them in.
[01:15:45.703 --> 01:15:48.604]  And the Germans are, do as you are told, submit to them.
[01:15:48.985 --> 01:15:50.526]  I mean, this is getting insane.
[01:15:51.287 --> 01:15:52.717]  Paul Watson, what is going on?
[01:15:52.757 --> 01:15:53.240]  Break it down.
[01:15:54.656 --> 01:15:58.718]  Well, why are governments inviting these, quote, migrants in?
[01:15:58.918 --> 01:16:00.780]  Why are they rolling out the red carpet?
[01:16:01.140 --> 01:16:19.190]  It's because they know once they settle, and they're talking about 800,000 just by the end of this year in Germany, 500,000 every year after that, by the time they settle down, become naturalized citizens, they have children who become naturalized citizens, you create a huge voting bloc, which votes for a bigger welfare state.
[01:16:19.250 --> 01:16:20.791]  And they have six kids on average.
[01:16:20.831 --> 01:16:22.092]  I mean, let's just talk about the facts.
[01:16:23.032 --> 01:16:38.957]  Yeah, which is promoted by these left-wing governments, so that's why it's in their interest to bring in huge numbers of people who have no concept of freedom, have no concept of treating women as first-class citizens, have no concept of, you know, civic responsibility.
[01:16:39.357 --> 01:16:40.798]  They just want the welfare money.
[01:16:41.198 --> 01:16:47.963]  That's why they're not staying in countries like Hungary, like Italy, because they're not showering them with free cash.
[01:16:48.283 --> 01:16:57.430]  They're fleeing to Sweden, they're fleeing to Germany, they'll soon be fleeing to the United Kingdom, because they're going to get free money, which again proves that they're not refugees.
[01:16:57.750 --> 01:17:00.912]  The definition of a refugee is fleeing from danger.
[01:17:01.252 --> 01:17:03.874]  These people are already in safe countries.
[01:17:04.174 --> 01:17:05.976]  They're economic migrants.
[01:17:06.556 --> 01:17:11.122]  Take the young Syrian boy that drowned, for example, which was obviously tragic.
[01:17:11.503 --> 01:17:21.837]  But that has been completely embellished, twisted and manipulated for political propaganda to say, oh, we have to be, you know, we have to have feelings and allow all these people in.
[01:17:22.498 --> 01:17:36.557]  They took that boy and basically dressed him up, flattened down his hair, moved him from one place which wasn't photogenic because he was stuck underneath a rock, put him on the beach, took pictures of him there, took pictures of him in other places.
[01:17:36.577 --> 01:17:37.198]  That's a crime!
[01:17:38.345 --> 01:17:40.406]  His family was already in Turkey.
[01:17:40.706 --> 01:17:42.166]  They weren't coming from Syria.
[01:17:42.386 --> 01:17:44.206]  They were already safe in Turkey.
[01:17:44.507 --> 01:17:46.927]  They were fleeing as economic migrants.
[01:17:46.987 --> 01:17:48.808]  So yes, it's incredibly tragic.
[01:17:49.188 --> 01:18:00.150]  But why are we being manipulated to think that this young boy died as a result of the West's immigration laws when his family was safe, relatively wealthy for the region?
[01:18:00.190 --> 01:18:02.591]  They had relatives in Canada as well.
[01:18:03.171 --> 01:18:06.232]  And they staged the body so they could get the best
[01:18:06.933 --> 01:18:10.946]  Uh, photo for the emotional manipulation... Just like the babies and the incubators.
[01:18:12.213 --> 01:18:15.255]  Yeah, they always use dead kids to rest their propaganda on.
[01:18:15.955 --> 01:18:20.178]  Then you had the guy and his wife and young child in Hungary.
[01:18:20.578 --> 01:18:23.379]  You know, they were on the train tracks wailing and crying.
[01:18:23.720 --> 01:18:25.761]  We saw those photos in the newspapers.
[01:18:26.061 --> 01:18:37.888]  What you didn't see in the video moments before that was that he physically pushed his wife and kids onto the rail track to create that photo op of look at these poor desperate immigrants
[01:18:38.388 --> 01:18:41.630]  When he created that situation with the police in the first place.
[01:18:42.010 --> 01:18:43.892]  So we're being completely manipulated.
[01:18:44.352 --> 01:18:48.675]  And again, 90% of these migrants are claiming to be Syrian.
[01:18:49.135 --> 01:18:50.536]  And they can't prove it.
[01:18:50.816 --> 01:18:53.438]  You've got Syrians coming out in the New York Times today.
[01:18:54.218 --> 01:18:55.979]  Who said, an actual Syrian migrant.
[01:18:56.299 --> 01:18:57.900]  I am Syrian, a real Syrian.
[01:18:58.120 --> 01:19:02.962]  Here we have Pakistanis, Afghanis, Iraqis, they all throw away their papers and claim to be Syrian.
[01:19:03.322 --> 01:19:10.766]  So they're finding all these discarded ID cards from Pakistanis and Bangladeshis in places like Macedonia.
[01:19:11.086 --> 01:19:15.408]  Because they're not refugees, they're economic migrants, they're not fleeing from ISIS.
[01:19:15.768 --> 01:19:18.150]  They're not fleeing from war or persecution.
[01:19:18.550 --> 01:19:43.449]  They're fleeing to get benefits and to get a higher standard of living, which we're going to have to pay for as taxpayers, while Gulf states like Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, United Arab Emirates take zero, zero refugees, despite many of those countries being directly involved in funding and arming the jihadist rebels in Syria who went on to join ISIS that caused this problem in the first place.
[01:19:43.809 --> 01:19:45.870]  So it's all about imposing this on the West.
[01:19:46.291 --> 01:19:55.757]  The European governments have rolled out the red carpet to get that power back in the hands of the EU, because the EU is being rejected continent-wide for the past three, four years.
[01:19:55.777 --> 01:19:56.618]  That's right, stay there.
[01:19:57.439 --> 01:20:09.027]  These people being brought in are nothing but socialist mercenaries in the cloward-driven strategy, and it just shows you the hardcore evil, evil, of the people running our governments.
[01:20:09.807 --> 01:20:14.670]  Turn on the news and you'll hear stories of natural disasters, political unrest, and financial crisis.
[01:20:15.010 --> 01:20:18.692]  In times of uncertainty, how will you take care of your family's most basic needs?

[01:21:11.224 --> 01:21:14.708]  The Electronic Frontier Foundation Privacy Report says it's AT&T.
[01:21:14.969 --> 01:21:19.795]  AT&T customers need to know this when calling the Alex Jones 24-7 listen line at 1-605-562-9000.

[01:22:02.508 --> 01:22:04.610]  As if chlorine in our water weren't bad enough, now they're adding ammonia?
[01:22:13.101 --> 01:22:13.622]  It's true.
[01:22:13.742 --> 01:22:17.705]  Some municipalities are now adding ammonia plus chlorine to your water supply.
[01:22:17.885 --> 01:22:19.726]  It's a disinfectant called chloramine.
[01:22:20.267 --> 01:22:24.770]  But with a trusted Big Berkey water filter, you can keep chloramine out of your water.

[01:23:13.917 --> 01:23:17.678]  And the home security industry wants you to believe that's your only option.
[01:23:17.958 --> 01:23:23.141]  They've got hordes of salesmen out there trying to scare you into signing one of their long-term contracts.
[01:23:23.421 --> 01:23:28.023]  You get stuck writing huge checks month after month with no way out.
[01:23:28.323 --> 01:23:31.544]  It's robbery by contract and it can cost you thousands.

[01:24:15.590 --> 01:24:21.633]  What happened this morning, Alex Jones here back live, is I stayed up last night doing research.
[01:24:22.094 --> 01:24:24.375]  I was up till like 11 with Buckley shooting videos.
[01:24:26.316 --> 01:24:28.337]  And then I was up till about 1 doing research.
[01:24:28.397 --> 01:24:36.801]  Then I got up again this morning and looked at all the news and I read this LA Times article where they just flat out say we're going to close half the roads and only let robot cars on them.
[01:24:38.413 --> 01:24:39.793]  I know the whole backstory of that.
[01:24:40.354 --> 01:24:42.494]  So, it's not just they're going to close the roads.
[01:24:42.534 --> 01:24:43.535]  I know the whole story.
[01:24:43.555 --> 01:24:47.876]  And how Rahm Emanuel's brother's making billions off of it, and how it's all a scam.
[01:24:48.756 --> 01:24:49.897]  We're just being conquered.
[01:24:51.697 --> 01:25:00.340]  I mean, if they can foist Obamacare on us, owned by foreign banks, to double and triple prices, well of course they're going to just bring in giant hordes of illegals.
[01:25:03.049 --> 01:25:12.374]  I mean, I used to hear six, seven years ago, the right wing claim that Muslims were telling British people, you know, to not have their women wear dresses or whatever that were above the knee.
[01:25:12.414 --> 01:25:16.036]  And now, I've basically been in England and seen it for myself.
[01:25:17.016 --> 01:25:25.061]  It's that Westerners are so passive now, and so wimpy, that foreigners just literally think we're here to serve them.
[01:25:25.941 --> 01:25:28.703]  And I've been in England before just videotaping Big Ben.
[01:25:29.585 --> 01:25:34.613]  This is actually on tape, and this guy comes over, a Muslim guy in his car with his family, gets out and says, don't tape me!
[01:25:34.693 --> 01:25:35.635]  What are you doing taping me?
[01:25:35.675 --> 01:25:38.920]  And I guess he thought I was going to cower down, and I just started yelling at him.
[01:25:38.940 --> 01:25:39.861]  I told him, go to hell.
[01:25:39.881 --> 01:25:41.424]  I said, I'll do whatever I want.
[01:25:42.290 --> 01:25:45.473]  But it's just, Paul, you live in England, you live under this.
[01:25:45.633 --> 01:25:47.074]  I'm not even against these people.
[01:25:47.734 --> 01:25:51.718]  Except they've been encouraged and pushed that we somehow owe them.
[01:25:51.798 --> 01:25:53.039]  It's the entitlement.
[01:25:53.579 --> 01:25:55.901]  I can't go to Saudi Arabia and get something free.
[01:25:55.921 --> 01:25:58.663]  If I go preach the gospel there, I'll be executed.
[01:25:59.244 --> 01:26:01.446]  Why is it that the people running us
[01:26:02.745 --> 01:26:06.388]  They hate our tolerance and that we're so good, tell us we're so bad.
[01:26:06.408 --> 01:26:13.172]  I'm not even upset now when I watch MSNBC criticizing America and saying how bad we are and how bad Christians are.
[01:26:13.653 --> 01:26:18.116]  I just realize they're the most evil, collaborating filth I've ever seen in my life.
[01:26:18.176 --> 01:26:20.137]  I mean, who are these people, Paul Watson?
[01:26:20.638 --> 01:26:22.919]  I didn't know they stacked crap that high.
[01:26:22.979 --> 01:26:23.500]  I'm sorry.
[01:26:25.558 --> 01:26:37.983]  Well, they're control freaks and they know that if they bring in these hordes of immigrants who don't cherish liberty, have no history of it, have no interest in defending it, then they will vote for big government parties.
[01:26:38.383 --> 01:26:45.026]  So they will collect more power in the hand of these leftist collectivist parties the more of these people they bring in.
[01:26:45.366 --> 01:26:54.050]  People who have done the maths with this Germany situation say that once these half a million asylum seekers every single year are brought in,
[01:26:54.710 --> 01:27:02.632]  Within a few decades, they're going to have like a quarter of the German population is going to be immigrants and sons and daughters of immigrants.
[01:27:02.672 --> 01:27:09.354]  So they're creating a huge voting block for these big government parties who are just going to vote for bigger and bigger government.
[01:27:09.754 --> 01:27:18.797]  And then big business loves it as well, of course, because they can get the cheap labor, they can drive down the wages of everybody else, so it benefits them in that way.
[01:27:19.637 --> 01:27:25.822]  And then you've got a situation with the media where it's all, oh look at these poor Syrian families and these children.
[01:27:26.102 --> 01:27:27.603]  And undoubtedly some of them are.
[01:27:28.004 --> 01:27:30.466]  But they're not showing any of these videos.
[01:27:30.486 --> 01:27:43.176]  They're not talking about how on the border of Italy and Austria a couple of days ago, these migrants were yanking old ladies out of a car to steal the car so they could get to Germany.
[01:27:43.336 --> 01:27:44.757]  Paul, Paul, we're going to do this.
[01:27:44.817 --> 01:27:46.719]  I've asked the crew to do it, but they're so busy we haven't.
[01:27:46.999 --> 01:27:56.567]  There are hundreds of videos at the tunnel and at the ferries from France with the robbing, the stealing, the carjacking, the beating, and the arrogant, crazy-eyed hatred of these illegals.
[01:27:56.968 --> 01:27:58.069]  Instead of feel bad,
[01:27:59.500 --> 01:28:03.725]  Which I'm not saying they should and feel like they're not culturally dominant or they're not wealthy.
[01:28:04.165 --> 01:28:06.088]  Instead, there's a hate of the West.
[01:28:06.448 --> 01:28:07.890]  You can see it in a lot of their eyes.
[01:28:08.330 --> 01:28:13.256]  And most of the immigrants I've seen so far from the Middle East are pretty cool, hard-working folks in my experience.
[01:28:13.576 --> 01:28:14.837]  This is a new wave.
[01:28:15.618 --> 01:28:16.700]  You live in it every day.
[01:28:16.780 --> 01:28:17.741]  Why is it so different?
[01:28:19.312 --> 01:28:21.614]  Because they've not been assimilated.
[01:28:22.074 --> 01:28:23.576]  It's been so overwhelming.
[01:28:23.856 --> 01:28:28.320]  I mean, in the UK, net migration is now 300,000 a year.
[01:28:28.600 --> 01:28:31.882]  This is a tiny island country with a 60 million population.
[01:28:32.383 --> 01:28:35.746]  And it's going so fast, there's no chance to assimilate them.
[01:28:36.046 --> 01:28:45.294]  So inevitably, they move into these Muslim ghettos, and then you get a situation like you've got in Sweden, where since the 70s, when they swung their doors wide open,
[01:28:45.834 --> 01:28:48.275]  Rapes are up 1400%.
[01:28:48.775 --> 01:28:53.017]  You get ambulances, fire trucks traveling into these Muslim ghetto areas.
[01:28:53.037 --> 01:28:56.158]  They have to leave because they just get pelted with stones and attacked.
[01:28:56.739 --> 01:29:02.061]  So you get this increasing balkanization because there's no time for them to assimilate into the culture.
[01:29:02.561 --> 01:29:07.745]  And our own leaders are basically committing national suicide and saying you don't have to assimilate.
[01:29:08.005 --> 01:29:09.386]  There's no plan in Germany to assimilate.
[01:29:09.406 --> 01:29:13.028]  And it's being done as a socialist fetish to mutilate the West.
[01:29:13.669 --> 01:29:16.331]  They really hate the West.
[01:29:16.451 --> 01:29:20.854]  Liberals really want their daughters gang raped and sexually mutilated with bags on their heads.
[01:29:21.334 --> 01:29:25.816]  Gloria Steinem, all these people are literally the scum of the earth and enemies.
[01:29:26.216 --> 01:29:32.439]  I mean, I'm sorry, they really are, they really are consciously evil, Paul, and the opposite of liberals.
[01:29:32.999 --> 01:29:35.480]  How do we stop these fascist satanists?
[01:29:35.681 --> 01:29:37.421]  I don't know what you call them when we come back.
[01:29:37.541 --> 01:29:39.042]  I mean, these people are the enemy.
[01:29:39.102 --> 01:29:42.784]  Final segment, Paul Lewis, five more minutes, Hugh Shardy's coming in with breaking news.
[01:29:43.544 --> 01:29:44.865]  I'm settling down some now.
[01:29:45.106 --> 01:29:46.847]  I mean, I haven't even covered the news yet.
[01:29:46.927 --> 01:29:49.109]  It is just, the robot cars are coming.
[01:29:49.149 --> 01:29:49.950]  It's all been announced.
[01:29:50.270 --> 01:29:53.733]  They're gonna tax you by the mile, raise your insurance, where you can't even have a car.
[01:29:54.374 --> 01:29:55.855]  They're gonna take all your jobs away.
[01:29:55.915 --> 01:29:56.976]  I mean, it's just hellish.
[01:29:59.158 --> 01:30:00.059]  We're on the march.
[01:30:00.559 --> 01:30:02.161]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:30:03.101 --> 01:30:05.764]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:10.049 --> 01:30:15.072]  Over the Labor Day weekend, we had reports of 8 being killed and 46 being wounded.
[01:30:15.492 --> 01:30:19.494]  July 4th of this year, we had reports of 9 dead and 53 wounded.
[01:30:19.994 --> 01:30:25.877]  And let us not forget, July 4th of last year, we had reports of 14 killed and 82 shot.
[01:30:26.397 --> 01:30:28.278]  And these are not nationwide stats.
[01:30:28.779 --> 01:30:34.782]  All of these numbers come from the city of Chicago, the city with some of the strictest gun laws in the nation.
[01:30:35.282 --> 01:30:40.007]  Which is to say, if criminals expect you to be unarmed, they're more likely to attack you.
[01:30:40.407 --> 01:30:44.691]  Not to mention the fact that much of this violence is linked to gangs or drug activity.
[01:30:45.192 --> 01:30:52.038]  Meaning that for all the gun buybacks and anti-gun commercials, criminals just haven't decided to turn in their firearms.
[01:30:52.839 --> 01:30:57.621]  And I understand that police have many responsibilities and they can't be every place at once.
[01:30:57.961 --> 01:31:01.863]  But that's why you have a Second Amendment so you'll be able to protect yourself.
[01:31:02.403 --> 01:31:05.945]  You can find more reports on InfoWars.com

[01:33:31.863 --> 01:33:35.107]  Shooter Jennings, bringing us in.
[01:33:36.868 --> 01:33:39.972]  He made this music, partly for us.
[01:33:40.332 --> 01:33:42.094]  Stephen King did the voiceovers.
[01:33:43.575 --> 01:33:45.598]  And it's in Police State 4, The Rise of FEMA.
[01:33:47.319 --> 01:33:48.020]  Really great.
[01:33:48.461 --> 01:33:51.364]  That's a good film, but I'd like to use some of his music in another upcoming film.
[01:33:54.966 --> 01:33:58.930]  Well, we can now see the clear plan to bring down the West and the rest of the world.
[01:33:59.550 --> 01:34:00.791]  I'm not against the third world.
[01:34:00.831 --> 01:34:01.832]  I want to help the third world.
[01:34:01.852 --> 01:34:06.176]  So I'm fighting carbon taxes that will kill a billion people in the next decade, many estimates show.
[01:34:07.037 --> 01:34:14.283]  And as the third world collapses, as I've been telling you for years, huge migrant waves will hit and will be used to destabilize things further.
[01:34:14.824 --> 01:34:19.108]  Then in the next phase, they're going to build armored walls around and not let these people in.
[01:34:19.909 --> 01:34:23.830]  They're only bringing in enough to checkmate the voting blocs and create balkanization.
[01:34:24.170 --> 01:34:25.471]  It's a management strategy.
[01:34:26.311 --> 01:34:33.774]  Then once that's done, you're going to see mega-plagues hit the third world and more than 80% will be killed.
[01:34:34.694 --> 01:34:42.357]  I'd rather industrialize folks, get their birthrate down to 1.5 like it is in the West, or 2.1 replacement rate, and us all live in peace.
[01:34:43.291 --> 01:34:44.792]  That's not the globalist plan.
[01:34:44.852 --> 01:34:46.473]  I am a worldwide expert on it.
[01:34:46.974 --> 01:34:49.716]  I've made films, I've written books, I've interviewed all the experts.
[01:34:50.536 --> 01:34:51.757]  This is not hyperbole.
[01:34:51.817 --> 01:34:53.679]  You didn't tune into a science fiction movie.
[01:34:54.319 --> 01:34:55.280]  We know what's coming.
[01:34:55.300 --> 01:34:57.201]  We told you forced inoculation was coming.
[01:34:57.321 --> 01:34:57.722]  It's here.
[01:34:58.342 --> 01:35:02.525]  We told you robot cars taking over the roads and half the roads being given to them at first.
[01:35:02.665 --> 01:35:03.626]  It's been announced today.
[01:35:04.487 --> 01:35:06.268]  We told you all of this.
[01:35:07.749 --> 01:35:10.191]  We told you the Chinese would start dumping treasury notes.
[01:35:10.211 --> 01:35:11.612]  I'm going to be covering that in the next hour.
[01:35:11.952 --> 01:35:12.573]  That's happening.
[01:35:13.837 --> 01:35:14.597]  I'm not bragging.
[01:35:14.957 --> 01:35:24.040]  There's a major conservative dissent brewing inside the Vatican, now that the Vatican is coming out basically promoting abortion, global government, and communism, and carbon taxes.
[01:35:26.740 --> 01:35:27.821]  It is an epic time.
[01:35:27.841 --> 01:35:30.201]  I want to get Paul Watson's final comments on this.
[01:35:32.482 --> 01:35:40.624]  But just to see these governments against the will of the people, Europe's voted 80 plus percent across the board to stop bringing in huge numbers of illegals.
[01:35:43.705 --> 01:35:44.845]  They're attacking police everywhere.
[01:35:44.865 --> 01:35:46.246]  They're burning down major cities.
[01:35:46.846 --> 01:35:53.228]  But it's the same stratagem here with inner-city blacks and other quote minorities getting foundation manipulated to do the same thing.
[01:35:53.488 --> 01:35:59.430]  Or they'll use white supremacist extremists if they're the majority in an area of Ukraine to overthrow the government there.
[01:35:59.790 --> 01:36:04.992]  It's outside globalists using whatever social problems they've got to do that.
[01:36:05.572 --> 01:36:12.194]  I mean it's like I'm not against pro-Western, historically pro-German Western Ukrainians.
[01:36:13.621 --> 01:36:16.923]  I get that the Russians did bad stuff to them, that Lenin and Stalin did.
[01:36:16.943 --> 01:36:18.104]  Doesn't matter.
[01:36:18.144 --> 01:36:22.187]  George Soros comes in, manipulates you, puts you in power to bring your whole country down.
[01:36:22.247 --> 01:36:22.808]  I'm against it.
[01:36:24.209 --> 01:36:26.751]  I mean, it doesn't mean I don't get the other cultural issues.
[01:36:27.071 --> 01:36:32.235]  I tried to stop the takedown of the Middle East when they kicked out Mubarak and all these other leaders that were working with us.
[01:36:32.715 --> 01:36:36.378]  And then they started blowing up all the churches and sending giant hordes of illegals in.
[01:36:37.620 --> 01:36:38.800]  Egypt's been allied with the U.S.
[01:36:38.840 --> 01:36:39.941]  for 36 years.
[01:36:39.981 --> 01:36:41.181]  They now work with the Russians.
[01:36:41.681 --> 01:36:42.582]  We lost Egypt.
[01:36:43.122 --> 01:36:45.163]  They were able to throw the Al Qaeda forces out.
[01:36:45.703 --> 01:36:51.725]  And Egypt's so freaked out, they got all the documents that Obama, through his cousin, was running the operations.
[01:36:55.946 --> 01:36:58.427]  Obama's not just some guy watching ESPN, folks.
[01:36:58.627 --> 01:36:59.487]  Let's get that straight.
[01:37:00.407 --> 01:37:01.848]  I used to think he was more of a front man.
[01:37:01.888 --> 01:37:04.629]  No, he's a mastermind, like Lex Luthor or something.
[01:37:05.450 --> 01:37:08.792]  I mean, this is like a comic book villain type stuff we're seeing.
[01:37:09.112 --> 01:37:12.794]  This is the kind of stuff you'd imagine, you know, Cobra Commander and Destro would pull.
[01:37:13.775 --> 01:37:15.916]  But you've got to realize that's art imitating life.
[01:37:15.956 --> 01:37:18.137]  This is what's happened before historically.
[01:37:18.157 --> 01:37:24.561]  I want to get Paul Watson's final comments before we shift gears into some other news, the economic news, you name it.
[01:37:24.641 --> 01:37:25.421]  The numbers are in.
[01:37:25.481 --> 01:37:30.244]  China in a month alone dumped $94 billion in U.S.
[01:37:30.284 --> 01:37:31.825]  Treasuries in one month.
[01:37:33.820 --> 01:37:36.781]  Goldman argues real figure might have been $115 billion.
[01:37:39.201 --> 01:37:40.682]  I mean, man!
[01:37:43.462 --> 01:37:49.664]  Let's go to Anthony Gucciardi to get his take on the open borders, on what's happening.
[01:37:49.704 --> 01:37:51.064]  You've got family in Italy.
[01:37:51.084 --> 01:37:54.065]  I didn't even tell you I was going to spring this on you.
[01:37:54.105 --> 01:37:57.766]  You want to share with them what it's like living at the hands of the precious illegals?
[01:37:58.661 --> 01:38:06.728]  I think people are losing their sanity and I understand the humanitarian part of it saying I want to help all these people because they're starving or whatever and they've been oppressed.
[01:38:06.768 --> 01:38:25.425]  I understand all that but we've lost our sanity I think when we start saying just open all the borders and let everyone in because yes I do have family in Italy and they tell me that one of the biggest things there is the gypsies and they live in a nice house in Rome area but they had to put bars on all their windows because when they would leave or in the middle of the night
[01:38:25.865 --> 01:38:45.162]  They would either throw bricks through the windows and try to get in and steal any electronic they could or they use tactics like this is horribly messed up but they'll have a kid and they'll like burn the kid on purpose so the kid has a real bad burn on his arm or something and say hey please will you help my child please help my child and then you let them into your house and they basically just beat you up and take your stuff.
[01:38:47.691 --> 01:38:52.533]  There is a lot of insanity out there, and people forget, unfortunately, history.
[01:38:52.573 --> 01:38:57.375]  They forget history, and they also forget that people have a large degree of evil that they can do as well.
[01:38:57.415 --> 01:39:01.677]  Because we feel bad for a lot of these people, and I'm sure they're great, I'm sure they're... No other country does this!
[01:39:01.737 --> 01:39:07.580]  The West, because it's Christian, does, and the Socialists are laughing at us because they're allied with these groups.
[01:39:07.660 --> 01:39:15.404]  It's like that new... But I'm not going to have a bunch of radical Muslims run around and try to attack my daughters, and then go, thank you, while the feminists stand around going, good!
[01:39:16.044 --> 01:39:17.345]  You know, I mean, it's sick!
[01:39:17.505 --> 01:39:19.968]  This new show on Netflix called Narcos is actually really good.
[01:39:19.988 --> 01:39:21.149]  It's about Pablo Escobar.
[01:39:21.670 --> 01:39:25.814]  And basically they figure out, well, selling all these drugs in Colombia doesn't make much money.
[01:39:25.874 --> 01:39:29.577]  If we just destroy the United States and bring it to Miami, we'll make so much more money.
[01:39:29.877 --> 01:39:33.701]  And those stupid gringos, they'll let us come in there and do anything we want.
[01:39:33.761 --> 01:39:34.682]  They won't even check us.
[01:39:35.042 --> 01:39:36.604]  We just walk across the border.
[01:39:36.884 --> 01:39:38.666]  And that's how he was making $40 million a day.
[01:39:39.867 --> 01:39:46.750]  Because they realized they could jack the prices up, sell it to the stupid Americans, and just bring in truckloads of- they would just pad their suits with it?
[01:39:46.930 --> 01:39:47.130]  Sure.
[01:39:47.170 --> 01:39:47.950]  I mean, I'll say this.
[01:39:48.190 --> 01:39:50.671]  If Europe and the West- because I don't like seeing any country destroyed.
[01:39:52.032 --> 01:39:54.273]  And I feel for the Japanese with their reactors melting down.
[01:39:55.834 --> 01:40:04.937]  But, if Japan went totally radioactive and was uninhabitable, I'd say, let, you know, 20% of the Japanese come over here and then other people take them.
[01:40:05.598 --> 01:40:08.599]  Because they've got jobs, they want to work hard, they want to assimilate.
[01:40:09.901 --> 01:40:18.127]  I'm sorry, we can't take people from first, from old world, third world, third world countries where they were in dirt villages and you chop women's genitals off.
[01:40:18.387 --> 01:40:19.748]  We can't take 50 million of them.
[01:40:19.828 --> 01:40:20.309]  I'm sorry.
[01:40:20.529 --> 01:40:24.492]  Well, I've seen the African immigrants too to different countries and they have signs like, get rid of your law.
[01:40:24.532 --> 01:40:25.933]  We want special privileges.
[01:40:25.973 --> 01:40:26.673]  We want welfare.
[01:40:26.733 --> 01:40:27.514]  We want all this stuff.
[01:40:27.554 --> 01:40:30.096]  It's like they're not even coming in and saying, hey, can we please come to your country?
[01:40:30.116 --> 01:40:31.277]  They're like, give us everything now.
[01:40:31.897 --> 01:40:32.597]  That's the attitude.
[01:40:32.617 --> 01:40:36.018]  They're not coming in saying, hey, we'll do whatever will work as much as we know.
[01:40:36.078 --> 01:40:37.219]  No, you ruined us.
[01:40:37.279 --> 01:40:38.579]  We want everything you have.
[01:40:38.699 --> 01:40:39.560]  It's that's the attitude.
[01:40:39.580 --> 01:40:45.562]  And that's the whole liberal sales job that the West ruined them when it was globalist corporations that are ruining everything.
[01:40:45.922 --> 01:40:47.442]  And they're the ones screwing us over.
[01:40:47.762 --> 01:40:48.203]  That's right.
[01:40:48.583 --> 01:40:51.764]  We've lost our sanity as a country, as a society, as a planet.
[01:40:52.124 --> 01:40:53.644]  We've completely lost our sanity.
[01:40:53.945 --> 01:40:54.965]  And we're going to pay for it.
[01:40:55.185 --> 01:40:57.026]  Well, the elite are committing suicide.
[01:40:57.126 --> 01:40:58.646]  They think they're suiciding the West.
[01:40:58.706 --> 01:41:02.387]  They think they're getting rid of the ladder where middle class could come up and new elites could threaten them.
[01:41:02.647 --> 01:41:11.730]  They think they're sewing things up with an age of ignorance when they're in basically Elysium bases offshore, underground, and in controlled reservations.
[01:41:12.110 --> 01:41:13.451]  They're not going to be immune from this.
[01:41:15.851 --> 01:41:18.312]  I mean, this is insane, and it's not helping the third world.
[01:41:18.993 --> 01:41:31.720]  And if they had, like, some type of free hydrogen power base, you could give money nationally to build reactors in Africa and have real programs and entrepreneur programs to go over there and build up Africa and then make money with these people.
[01:41:32.100 --> 01:41:32.841]  I'd be all for it.
[01:41:33.021 --> 01:41:33.921]  Yeah, why don't they push that?
[01:41:33.981 --> 01:41:37.003]  Why is it that all these immigrants need to be accepted by every other country?
[01:41:37.043 --> 01:41:40.704]  Why can't we actually perform industry in places like Africa?
[01:41:40.724 --> 01:41:42.405]  Because globalism doesn't allow that.
[01:41:42.425 --> 01:41:45.587]  If they keep them in squalor, they'll never develop and you get everything cheap.
[01:41:46.027 --> 01:41:46.967]  It's totally cutthroat.
[01:41:47.607 --> 01:41:52.289]  The globalists know to go with the most evil plan they can, just exempt themselves and they'll win.
[01:41:52.990 --> 01:41:55.511]  That's why whatever the worst, most evil thing is, they'll do it.
[01:41:56.687 --> 01:42:04.009]  I mean, I studied the New World Order for 25 years, 23 intensely, 20 on air, and Anthony, I just cannot believe how they got it all thought out.
[01:42:04.229 --> 01:42:12.051]  Then I'll read a book by Brzezinski or somebody, and I'm reading stuff and I know what the next paragraph's gonna be, because I've already studied it so much, I'm like in their head.
[01:42:12.771 --> 01:42:14.071]  They admit all this!
[01:42:14.991 --> 01:42:20.213]  Brzezinski wrote a book admitting how our government funded the Khmer Rouge to kill 30% of the public.
[01:42:21.473 --> 01:42:25.834]  He made a joke, he goes, but I can't get in trouble because I had the Khmer Rouge did it, and giggles.
[01:42:27.335 --> 01:42:28.176]  Basically in the article.
[01:42:28.216 --> 01:42:30.258]  I mean, it's just like, why?
[01:42:30.518 --> 01:42:31.439]  The debate is over.
[01:42:31.619 --> 01:42:36.243]  I mean, we're all arguing about tax rates and all this kind of stuff as the major corporations pay no tax.
[01:42:36.263 --> 01:42:43.790]  They get everything made in China in places with suicide nets because the workers want to kill themselves for being paid one penny a day, like Apple using Foxconn.
[01:42:44.151 --> 01:42:48.495]  And then we are told that we're bad and that we need to let all the immigrants in and pay for them and we're horrible people.
[01:42:48.875 --> 01:42:51.276]  As they lord over us and laugh at us, don't pay taxes.
[01:42:51.296 --> 01:42:57.740]  Steve Jobs is a complete monster and wanted slave labor and wouldn't let his kids have iPads and admitted it was a brain damage to the public.
[01:42:57.940 --> 01:43:01.662]  Had a kid and paid the woman $500 after trying to sue her in welfare.
[01:43:01.682 --> 01:43:03.142]  It's just such insanity.
[01:43:03.162 --> 01:43:05.784]  They would spend months in depositions and stuff not to pay somebody money.
[01:43:06.184 --> 01:43:07.405]  Yeah, like $500.
[01:43:07.465 --> 01:43:08.146]  He's worth billions.
[01:43:08.226 --> 01:43:10.428]  I mean, these people... But then we're bad, though.
[01:43:10.668 --> 01:43:11.369]  We're the bad ones.
[01:43:12.049 --> 01:43:18.515]  And it's okay, though, because... The Rockefellers and the Gettys would have pay phones in their houses and wouldn't let their guests use a telephone.
[01:43:19.756 --> 01:43:20.977]  But then we're not paying enough.
[01:43:21.017 --> 01:43:22.379]  Warren Buffett basically pays nothing.
[01:43:23.059 --> 01:43:25.341]  And then lobbies all day to have taxes raised, but he's exempt.
[01:43:26.402 --> 01:43:26.943]  Yeah.
[01:43:27.023 --> 01:43:28.845]  He is a monster pig.
[01:43:29.785 --> 01:43:31.207]  He is a monster demon.
[01:43:32.298 --> 01:43:34.419]  But do you see, they turned the debate around on us, though.
[01:43:34.920 --> 01:43:41.744]  Because now, Alex, you're bad, because you don't want to let immigrants flood into your country, and you're bad because... Well, I mean, I want skilled immigrants.
[01:43:41.784 --> 01:43:59.396]  I don't care what color somebody is, but man, let me tell you, radical Islam is telling me my wife's got to wear a hood over her head and can't drive a car, and my kids, you know, have to do what they say, and I can't listen to rock and roll if I want, blah, blah, blah, and it's the left promoting these people coming in, but the left tells me I can't say boy or girl.
[01:43:59.636 --> 01:43:59.836]  Right.
[01:43:59.976 --> 01:44:01.097]  I mean, it's freakish!
[01:44:01.177 --> 01:44:02.078]  It's freakville!
[01:44:02.458 --> 01:44:07.381]  And they disregard their moral obligations to help these people in ways that matter, which we just covered, that'll never be done.
[01:44:07.401 --> 01:44:08.822]  But notice the debate is not about that.
[01:44:08.882 --> 01:44:10.824]  It's not about, why don't we bring industry to Africa?
[01:44:11.204 --> 01:44:12.565]  It's, why are we bad?
[01:44:13.866 --> 01:44:17.728]  They have flipped the debate 100%, and they have succeeded in doing so, and you're highlighting it right now.
[01:44:18.049 --> 01:44:19.370]  They have turned it on us.
[01:44:19.490 --> 01:44:19.950]  It's about us now.
[01:44:19.970 --> 01:44:20.290]  That's right.
[01:44:20.550 --> 01:44:22.332]  Paul Joseph Watts, an incredible job.
[01:44:22.352 --> 01:44:24.853]  I want to let you get back to writing articles and covering things.
[01:44:24.873 --> 01:44:26.775]  Other tidbits of this we haven't covered.
[01:44:27.235 --> 01:44:28.276]  Is there any way
[01:44:29.252 --> 01:44:31.198]  Most countries didn't vote to be part of the EU.
[01:44:31.218 --> 01:44:32.321]  The UK didn't get to vote.
[01:44:32.622 --> 01:44:35.109]  You got major buildup to have a vote, get out of the EU.
[01:44:36.857 --> 01:44:38.538]  The EU is going into total tyranny.
[01:44:38.678 --> 01:44:46.243]  They're admitting in mainstream news, the Telegraph today, that the EU is using this to become a super state and remove any sovereignty and to become a dictatorship.
[01:44:46.303 --> 01:44:48.484]  So, we see that the endgame of this.
[01:44:49.045 --> 01:44:50.406]  Is there any way to stop it?
[01:44:50.466 --> 01:44:53.868]  I mean, can't people in government in Europe just stop complying?
[01:44:54.328 --> 01:44:59.451]  Why do the leftists that control government enjoy destroying themselves?
[01:44:59.591 --> 01:45:00.192]  I don't understand it.
[01:45:01.870 --> 01:45:04.472]  I think it's actually a kind of fetish, Alex.
[01:45:04.912 --> 01:45:07.914]  I mean, we've had this term cook-servative over the past couple of months.
[01:45:08.354 --> 01:45:10.115]  This is political cook-holding.
[01:45:10.595 --> 01:45:15.779]  If you look into that, I don't want to get into it too deeply because it's probably not family-friendly, but I think it's a kind of fetish.
[01:45:15.799 --> 01:45:17.099]  No, it's a form of domination.
[01:45:17.159 --> 01:45:18.340]  It is a sick fetish.
[01:45:18.380 --> 01:45:19.161]  It's funny you said that.
[01:45:19.261 --> 01:45:19.441]  Yeah.
[01:45:20.202 --> 01:45:22.203]  Well I think wider solutions.
[01:45:22.263 --> 01:45:30.145]  The good news is the most recent poll for the first time has found that the majority of British citizens are going to vote to get out of the EU.
[01:45:30.505 --> 01:45:33.445]  Past three years we've had massive rejection of the EU.
[01:45:33.766 --> 01:45:40.787]  If that continues we're going to get control back over our national border and immigration policies to a greater extent.
[01:45:40.827 --> 01:45:43.008]  So that's good news if we can carry on that course.
[01:45:43.408 --> 01:45:56.092]  Geopolitically, let's stop overthrowing secular governments in the Middle East and replacing them with jihadist radical Islamists, which is what caused this refugee crisis in the first place.
[01:45:56.132 --> 01:45:57.413]  How about that for a good idea?
[01:45:57.813 --> 01:46:03.395]  And then domestically, it's just about, you know, I'm not ashamed to be proud of where I was born and where I come from.
[01:46:03.635 --> 01:46:05.236]  I'm not ashamed of the Enlightenment.
[01:46:05.276 --> 01:46:07.236]  I'm not ashamed of the Industrial Revolution.
[01:46:07.516 --> 01:46:09.477]  I'm not ashamed of the Magna Carta.
[01:46:09.757 --> 01:46:11.698]  I'm not ashamed of freedom and liberty.
[01:46:12.038 --> 01:46:24.622]  So it's just about reasserting those principles, voting on those principles, while we've still got the chance to do it, in the face of these mass hordes of migrants that are going to vote for bigger government, and the solution lies in that.
[01:46:24.702 --> 01:46:29.744]  So there's still hope yet, but obviously, you know, you had Paulson the other day.
[01:46:30.444 --> 01:46:31.665]  You should probably play the video.
[01:46:32.205 --> 01:46:37.168]  Wealth inequality is what has caused much of this unrest, not only in America but across the world.
[01:46:37.468 --> 01:46:47.874]  He was laughing, he was up at a meeting with Sheryl Sandberg and these other CEOs saying, we increased the wealth gap, we increased wealth inequality, while laughing his head off at it.
[01:46:48.314 --> 01:47:05.177]  So, again, they're bragging about it, they're laughing about it, as you said, so it's about pointing out who's behind it, voting to reject this EU tyranny which has brought in this imposed multiculturalism, and eventually I think there's just going to be a clash of civilizations.
[01:47:05.217 --> 01:47:11.619]  I think, you know, it might not be for 10, 20, 30 years, but that's the only way it's going to figure itself out in the end, I'm afraid.
[01:47:12.739 --> 01:47:13.820]  Just a couple years, Paul.
[01:47:13.900 --> 01:47:15.121]  Everything is accelerating.
[01:47:15.401 --> 01:47:19.465]  Things compact historically, but definitely this is going to be an interesting time to be alive.
[01:47:19.986 --> 01:47:26.872]  Last week I went and saw a film, not knowing I'm in it, that's won some Sundance Awards and others.
[01:47:27.092 --> 01:47:28.013]  It's The Best of Enemies.
[01:47:29.474 --> 01:47:30.855]  William F. Buckley and Gore Vidal.
[01:47:31.952 --> 01:47:41.137]  And of course I knew Gore Vidal, he was a frequent guest on the show, and I didn't agree with a lot of his politics, but he liked the fact that I exposed that 9-11 was an inside job.
[01:47:41.497 --> 01:47:43.859]  So I interviewed him in person six or seven times on radio.
[01:47:44.579 --> 01:47:47.561]  But I tell you, the guy that comes out as the good guy is William F. Buckley in that movie.
[01:47:48.021 --> 01:47:54.082]  But in it, Gore Vidal's playing a money war and class envy with William F. Buckley in this debate.
[01:47:54.122 --> 01:47:57.123]  And Buckley's like, you're worth ten times more money than me.
[01:47:57.563 --> 01:47:59.063]  My family actually made its money.
[01:47:59.083 --> 01:48:00.063]  You've been given your money.
[01:48:00.083 --> 01:48:01.884]  And that's what he said in the actual debate.
[01:48:01.924 --> 01:48:02.804]  I went and watched more of it.
[01:48:03.044 --> 01:48:04.344]  They didn't even show that in the film.
[01:48:04.664 --> 01:48:06.525]  But Buckley's just amazed at all this.
[01:48:07.785 --> 01:48:12.046]  And he then expands on it, but Gore Vidal's like,
[01:48:13.188 --> 01:48:18.192]  We've got 7% of the public that's got 38% of something like that.
[01:48:18.573 --> 01:48:22.516]  It was like 6-7% has almost 40% of the wealth, and that's wrong.
[01:48:22.536 --> 01:48:23.477]  We need to redistribute it.
[01:48:23.797 --> 01:48:29.942]  Well, under the redistribution, we got 1% with like 80% of it.
[01:48:29.982 --> 01:48:33.245]  But they act like that 1% of these rich people, no, no, most of the 1%
[01:48:34.935 --> 01:48:37.276]  ...are worth $150,000-$200,000 a year.
[01:48:37.296 --> 01:48:42.698]  That's the person that gets their hair done, their nails done, buys a car, buys a boat, goes to your restaurant.
[01:48:43.379 --> 01:48:44.899]  I mean, we want to make that bigger.
[01:48:45.340 --> 01:48:46.500]  They switched it, though.
[01:48:46.720 --> 01:48:52.623]  They switched it that you're bad, not they're bad, not the .001% that actually controls and runs everything.
[01:48:52.643 --> 01:48:55.264]  Well, it's worse than that.
[01:48:55.344 --> 01:48:57.885]  We did the math.
[01:48:57.925 --> 01:48:58.005]  It's .0000000024.
[01:48:58.045 --> 01:48:58.305]  Right.
[01:48:58.325 --> 01:49:01.827]  They're the ones that have most of the wealth, and they're the ones all calling for socialism.
[01:49:02.347 --> 01:49:12.112]  But you're bad, and the plumber that makes $150,000 a year that works 16 hours a day- He's got four guys working for him, took him 20 years of quality, with the right people, to have the clientele- Loot his house.
[01:49:12.352 --> 01:49:12.892]  He's horrible.
[01:49:13.192 --> 01:49:14.333]  No, it's all a distraction.
[01:49:14.573 --> 01:49:30.381]  Just like the corporations pay no tax, those people, the .0000002% or whatever, they don't pay any tax, they control tons of stuff, they do horrible things, and then they make the 1%, which is the plumber that has four people working for him, and it's his family business, he's run it for 30 years, and he finally has a little nest egg.
[01:49:31.240 --> 01:49:31.821]  Get rid of him.
[01:49:31.881 --> 01:49:32.461]  Loot his house.
[01:49:32.501 --> 01:49:33.402]  How dare he have money?
[01:49:33.562 --> 01:49:34.663]  Money can be good.
[01:49:35.544 --> 01:49:37.226]  Money is what helps other people.
[01:49:37.926 --> 01:49:39.128]  That's what America was all about.
[01:49:39.148 --> 01:49:40.269]  That's why you want to come here.
[01:49:40.569 --> 01:49:41.190]  Now it's not.
[01:49:42.551 --> 01:49:43.812]  Paul Watson, great job.
[01:49:43.832 --> 01:49:47.436]  We will continue to see your reports at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:49:47.736 --> 01:49:49.698]  Your latest report is on DrudgeReport.com.
[01:49:49.978 --> 01:49:52.000]  Good to have you back from your investigation.
[01:49:52.040 --> 01:49:52.481]  Godspeed.
[01:49:53.301 --> 01:49:53.742]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:49:54.821 --> 01:49:56.402]  There goes Paul Joseph Watson.
[01:49:56.442 --> 01:49:59.043]  More and more I just have him ride shotgun with me where we go back and forth.
[01:49:59.363 --> 01:50:00.984]  I talk five minutes, he talks five minutes.
[01:50:01.544 --> 01:50:05.726]  And that's why I'm getting more of you guys, the riders, in here on the air.
[01:50:06.066 --> 01:50:08.587]  You've got some health news we're going to get to in the next break.
[01:50:10.488 --> 01:50:12.769]  We got McAfee popping in.
[01:50:12.789 --> 01:50:14.250]  I talked to him last night.
[01:50:14.290 --> 01:50:15.490]  He's got an interesting announcement.
[01:50:15.950 --> 01:50:17.491]  So we got John McAfee joining us.
[01:50:18.191 --> 01:50:21.733]  I'm going to skip this network break, but the last one I'm skipping this week.
[01:50:22.233 --> 01:50:23.634]  I'm not going to skip more breaks this week.
[01:50:24.537 --> 01:50:27.259]  I'm going to get good about this, but I've gotten behind today, so I'm going to do it.
[01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:36.527]  Before we get into this huge health news, some of it really interesting and ties into the deindustrialization and the globalist plan and why they want to do that.
[01:50:36.567 --> 01:50:37.768]  This is a key piece of intel.
[01:50:38.369 --> 01:50:44.354]  Let's talk about knockout because this is one from one of the largest organic manufacturers in the country.
[01:50:44.474 --> 01:50:48.077]  They said, yeah, usually people just put melatonin or valerian together max.
[01:50:48.157 --> 01:50:50.339]  We put eight different things with that in.
[01:50:51.604 --> 01:50:53.565]  This isn't sluggish when you wake up in the morning.
[01:50:54.967 --> 01:50:56.348]  But I took it when I went to Europe.
[01:50:56.408 --> 01:50:59.010]  I've taken it when I go on other trips, when I can't fall asleep on a plane.
[01:50:59.490 --> 01:51:00.971]  I take it and an hour later I just want to go to sleep.
[01:51:01.752 --> 01:51:04.694]  And I ended up sleeping on the way back from Europe eight hours.
[01:51:04.834 --> 01:51:07.896]  I've never on a transcontinental flight, but I've slept more than two, three hours.
[01:51:08.417 --> 01:51:11.199]  And I've taken pills before just to see what they do.
[01:51:11.219 --> 01:51:14.761]  I feel horrible for six hours after I wake up, groggy.
[01:51:15.182 --> 01:51:18.024]  Tell folks, Anthony Guciardi, because Knockout just came back in.
[01:51:18.844 --> 01:51:27.267]  Today, the truck arrived this morning from the lab, and we got a larger amount of it this time, because it sold out in just a few days, and we got a smaller quantity.
[01:51:27.567 --> 01:51:34.410]  Tell people, and we've got rave reviews, folks can see the reviews, at Infowarslife.com, how important sleep is.
[01:51:34.470 --> 01:51:39.372]  It's linked to getting cancer, it's linked to being angry, it's linked to having health problems, aging.
[01:51:40.052 --> 01:51:43.473]  But the drugs, the sleeping pills and things, don't give you real deep sleep, folks.
[01:51:43.513 --> 01:51:43.913]  Look it up.
[01:51:44.653 --> 01:51:46.014]  Natural valerian root,
[01:51:47.486 --> 01:52:06.046]  And things like melatonin, L-tryptophan, chamomile flower extract, lemon balm, leaf extract, hops flower extract, L-theanine and others, gamma acid and other things, absolutely works with your brain to just get you to turn loose and have deep, restful, delicious sleep.
[01:52:06.066 --> 01:52:07.528]  That's why I've had so much energy.
[01:52:07.928 --> 01:52:09.490]  Tell folks about Knockout Anthony.
[01:52:09.770 --> 01:52:13.652]  I know you're excited to have it back because you ask every single day if it's back because you're out of your bottle.
[01:52:14.312 --> 01:52:18.814]  But yeah, so most people are catching on to the reality that melatonin is what you need.
[01:52:19.615 --> 01:52:21.676]  And it just came out today actually in the news.
[01:52:21.696 --> 01:52:23.617]  I believe I did print it here.
[01:52:24.057 --> 01:52:27.819]  Yes, light from smartphones and tablets affects melatonin levels.
[01:52:27.839 --> 01:52:29.380]  That's what we've always told you to eat your brain.
[01:52:29.620 --> 01:52:32.281]  Right, so this is out actually this weekend.
[01:52:32.541 --> 01:52:39.288]  Research offers a compelling reason for parents to ban smartphones, tablets, and laptops in their children's bedroom at night.
[01:52:39.589 --> 01:52:43.433]  The bright light of these devices may lower levels of melatonin, a hormone that prompts sleep.
[01:52:43.833 --> 01:52:44.935]  So really all light, though.
[01:52:45.315 --> 01:52:47.197]  But this is right in your face before you go to bed.
[01:52:47.217 --> 01:52:49.019]  Well, it's artificial LED style.
[01:52:49.039 --> 01:52:49.840]  It's very toxic.
[01:52:50.020 --> 01:52:56.524]  You're on your phone, you're on your iPad, you're on your Kindle, whatever, it's emitting light into your brain and your body says, oh, it's still light out, I don't need to go to sleep.
[01:52:57.004 --> 01:52:59.226]  And that's why light pollution is such a big issue.
[01:52:59.486 --> 01:53:07.331]  If you're sleeping with the lights on, your melatonin production is drastically destroyed, especially when you sleep with lights on, because you want complete darkness.
[01:53:07.431 --> 01:53:09.912]  And if you're not getting complete darkness, you're not going to get that restful sleep.
[01:53:10.193 --> 01:53:13.455]  So here's the thing, though, people are catching on and they're taking melatonin.
[01:53:14.255 --> 01:53:15.716]  Here's an article today as well.
[01:53:16.136 --> 01:53:19.717]  Students gaining taste for melatonin supplements to combat fatigue.
[01:53:20.357 --> 01:53:24.378]  Many students and institutes of higher learning suffer from sleep deprivation and blah blah blah.
[01:53:24.418 --> 01:53:29.740]  And again, because the gut is so dead, you're not producing enough of it in the stomach for the brain.
[01:53:29.940 --> 01:53:31.761]  Yep, and it's linked up in this study from today.
[01:53:32.181 --> 01:53:34.802]  Study too little sleep increases your risk of catching a cold.
[01:53:34.842 --> 01:53:36.002]  It's all linked up to your immune system.
[01:53:36.162 --> 01:53:41.464]  But, but, but, but, melatonin works for a lot of people, doesn't work for everybody.
[01:53:41.564 --> 01:53:44.669]  Well, what the studies have found, because I've done deep research on this, so have you.
[01:53:45.210 --> 01:53:48.235]  We've had scientists and brain doctors, you name it, on.
[01:53:48.876 --> 01:53:50.779]  It stops working after a while.
[01:53:50.979 --> 01:53:51.180]  Right.
[01:53:51.420 --> 01:53:54.245]  That's why you've got to fuse it with exercise.
[01:53:55.171 --> 01:54:01.896]  With having a dark room, with having a fan on or white noise, and something like knockout.
[01:54:01.916 --> 01:54:02.976]  Valerian root extract.
[01:54:03.117 --> 01:54:07.460]  Because we know that, I mean melatonin is excellent, it's a base ingredient.
[01:54:07.480 --> 01:54:07.880]  Gotta have it.
[01:54:08.280 --> 01:54:12.803]  But we knew that we wanted to have a more complete profile on this product, not just melatonin.
[01:54:12.823 --> 01:54:19.428]  I mean you could get melatonin for pretty much the same price, but this has multiple ingredients like valerian root extract, L-Tryptophan, lemon balm leaf extract.
[01:54:19.688 --> 01:54:20.308]  Good dose.
[01:54:20.528 --> 01:54:22.189]  Most of the pills out there are 3 milligrams.
[01:54:22.649 --> 01:54:25.891]  Ours is 3 milligrams of melatonin, L-tryptophan, 15 milligrams.
[01:54:25.911 --> 01:54:26.751]  That's what's in turkey.
[01:54:27.231 --> 01:54:29.352]  That's what a big meat meal makes you sleepy.
[01:54:30.092 --> 01:54:33.014]  Calomel root extract, 18 milligrams.
[01:54:33.714 --> 01:54:35.635]  Lemon balm, 45 milligrams.
[01:54:35.815 --> 01:54:37.736]  Valerian root, 30 milligrams.
[01:54:39.097 --> 01:54:41.859]  L-theanine, 100 milligrams.
[01:54:41.939 --> 01:54:43.520]  I mean, this is a strong dose, folks.
[01:54:43.540 --> 01:54:44.561]  And here's a cool thing, too, though.
[01:54:44.601 --> 01:54:50.646]  Melatonin, we have pure melatonin in it, but then L-tryptophan, what people don't understand, oh, I take it and I get sleepy.
[01:54:50.686 --> 01:54:53.689]  That's because it naturally converts into melatonin, right?
[01:54:53.909 --> 01:54:59.274]  So we have another layer there of L-tryptophan that's going to be converted by your body naturally into the melatonin that you need.
[01:54:59.854 --> 01:55:03.517]  And then the valerian root extract, I mean, that's used as far back as Greece and Rome.
[01:55:04.458 --> 01:55:10.681]  The Greek physician Galen dubbed the Valerian Root as a remedy for sleeplessness and insomnia, so this has been used forever.
[01:55:10.721 --> 01:55:12.643]  We're just taking all the things that are known to work.
[01:55:13.043 --> 01:55:17.225]  And listen, I went to the store, this was about two years ago, and I said, I want to sleep in, I want to sleep in.
[01:55:17.245 --> 01:55:20.987]  I've been to Whole Foods, everything has one ingredient, or maybe two.
[01:55:21.547 --> 01:55:22.588]  Why don't they fuse it all?
[01:55:22.608 --> 01:55:29.171]  Because I was sitting there with my kids some nights, you know, they'd eaten some sugar too late or whatever, give them a couple different pills, and I'm like, I don't want to do that.
[01:55:29.231 --> 01:55:30.072]  I want to give them one thing.
[01:55:30.272 --> 01:55:30.412]  Yeah.
[01:55:30.632 --> 01:55:31.233]  So that's what we did.
[01:55:31.333 --> 01:55:32.154]  It's just one deal.
[01:55:32.594 --> 01:55:34.476]  It's very affordable, very low cost.
[01:55:35.077 --> 01:55:39.262]  A bottle of melatonin is the cost of this, and the melatonin I have at home is three milligrams.
[01:55:39.722 --> 01:55:40.063]  Yeah, I know.
[01:55:40.203 --> 01:55:41.284]  And this has a ton of more stuff.
[01:55:41.324 --> 01:55:45.589]  It's because people don't want to pay the price to make a good product and then sell it and not get that good of a markup.
[01:55:45.729 --> 01:55:46.690]  Tell folks how much it is.
[01:55:46.730 --> 01:55:47.591]  We'll put it up on screen.
[01:55:47.772 --> 01:55:49.253]  It is, I believe...
[01:55:50.134 --> 01:55:54.895]  As of right now, let's pull it up on screen because I want to make sure we give people... 1995!
[01:55:54.935 --> 01:55:55.876]  1995 is the discounted price.
[01:55:56.056 --> 01:55:58.676]  A bottle of Valerian Roof is between $15 and $20.
[01:55:59.157 --> 01:56:01.977]  A bottle of Melatonin between $15 and $20.
[01:56:02.818 --> 01:56:06.118]  I mean, again, this has got everything right there.
[01:56:06.158 --> 01:56:06.899]  You save money.
[01:56:07.439 --> 01:56:15.201]  And the reason I waited for the price is you actually decided to still give them the discounted price even though it just came in and it's been sold out for a month plus.
[01:56:15.741 --> 01:56:17.442]  So you get it right now for $19.95 on Infowarslife.com.
[01:56:19.172 --> 01:56:28.441]  That's right, and the little bit of profit we make, because again, we go to these companies and something's costing us $6, $7, $8 a bottle, they go, we're glad you're doing this, no one else does it.
[01:56:28.801 --> 01:56:31.263]  If something costs $8 a bottle, you sell it for $30 or $40.
[01:56:31.904 --> 01:56:34.667]  Most people sell stuff for $19.95 that costs them $2 a bottle.
[01:56:34.867 --> 01:56:35.567]  Yeah, or less.
[01:56:35.668 --> 01:56:39.811]  Okay, you have to understand, folks, something like Supermel Vitality is costing me $20.
[01:56:40.772 --> 01:56:43.135]  Now there's still markup there, we've got to fund the operation.
[01:56:43.675 --> 01:56:49.601]  But I mean, I want to, you know, have markup, be able to fund things, but really give you the Rolls-Royce, because that's what I want.
[01:56:49.761 --> 01:56:50.762]  I take my own products.
[01:56:51.443 --> 01:56:55.967]  And it's shocking that there really aren't a lot of companies out there that do it.
[01:56:57.287 --> 01:57:00.269]  Groups that do are InfoWarsHealth.com.
[01:57:00.289 --> 01:57:02.210]  The longevity line is excellent.
[01:57:02.531 --> 01:57:10.035]  I haven't taken all their 400 plus products, but I know they have neurotic level safety standards and quality and are a huge company around 19 years now.
[01:57:10.776 --> 01:57:11.857]  And so I'm involved with them.
[01:57:11.897 --> 01:57:13.318]  I promote InfoWarsHealth.com.
[01:57:13.618 --> 01:57:16.240]  When you purchase longevity products there, it helps fund our operation as well.
[01:57:17.200 --> 01:57:21.062]  Our products, we only have 14 of them, are game changers.
[01:57:21.723 --> 01:57:22.403]  Game changers.
[01:57:22.463 --> 01:57:28.687]  Briefly, Anthony, I'll do five more minutes with you to cover this other news before Mr. McAfee joins us.
[01:57:30.694 --> 01:57:33.355]  We also are going to sell out of the liver shield.
[01:57:33.515 --> 01:57:35.795]  Again, very hard to make, very hard to get the herbs.
[01:57:36.076 --> 01:57:37.436]  I don't want to change the formula.
[01:57:37.456 --> 01:57:40.157]  Group was here this week, but we may have to because we just can't get some.
[01:57:40.177 --> 01:57:42.577]  It's going to be out within probably the next few days or at the end of this week.
[01:57:42.958 --> 01:57:43.318]  For sure.
[01:57:43.358 --> 01:57:44.858]  Well, there's only like a thousand bottles left.
[01:57:44.878 --> 01:57:45.978]  It'll be gone today.
[01:57:46.179 --> 01:57:47.299]  I almost don't even want to promote it.
[01:57:47.359 --> 01:57:48.759]  It'll be gone immediately.
[01:57:48.799 --> 01:57:48.939]  Sure.
[01:57:48.979 --> 01:57:50.700]  The point is, that's how good our stuff is.
[01:57:51.080 --> 01:57:52.240]  We'd rather just have it for you.
[01:57:53.221 --> 01:57:54.001]  How long till the
[01:57:54.878 --> 01:57:57.099]  Till the, uh, Cleanze runs out.
[01:57:57.479 --> 01:58:00.020]  Deep Cleanze is selling out probably this week.
[01:58:00.400 --> 01:58:03.742]  And it's funny because, I mean, how many times do we try?
[01:58:03.762 --> 01:58:08.584]  We try and get as much as we can, but we're not going to sacrifice the quality, so it just comes in, it sells out for like two months, then we get more.
[01:58:09.004 --> 01:58:20.308]  We're trying to get more in, but we're just not going to sacrifice the quality, we're not going to go down in the- And I'll be honest, I've talked to three different manufacturers, Group's just one of them, and they said, if you want this quality, sorry, because they want to sell it to us too.
[01:58:20.448 --> 01:58:20.868]  Yeah, they do.
[01:58:20.968 --> 01:58:23.269]  And I'm not trying to cut corners, can we place it with something else?
[01:58:23.329 --> 01:58:24.290]  And we just haven't been able to.
[01:58:24.890 --> 01:58:34.297]  So that's why this stuff sold out almost all our products, because it's hard to get wet herbs that are from organic areas and then have them triple tested as we do.
[01:58:34.417 --> 01:58:39.221]  I mean, most of our products, I think all of them, are above California standards, which other people can't even do.
[01:58:40.161 --> 01:58:41.542]  So, I mean, you've got a commitment from us.
[01:58:41.903 --> 01:58:43.084]  It'd be the highest quality we can.
[01:58:43.284 --> 01:58:45.926]  Plus, we have a lot of enemies, so they help us keep the quality up as well.
[01:58:45.946 --> 01:58:48.007]  888-253-3139 to call.

[02:00:15.663 --> 02:00:16.324]  Big Brother.
[02:00:16.984 --> 02:00:18.005]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:18.746 --> 02:00:19.826]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:20.507 --> 02:00:21.308]  You want answers?
[02:00:22.088 --> 02:00:22.989]  Well, so does he.

[02:00:32.917 --> 02:00:35.559]  Well, Rupert Murdoch says Biden will win the nomination.
[02:00:36.140 --> 02:00:36.920]  Be hard to beat.
[02:00:39.082 --> 02:00:40.924]  Hillary Clinton sinking into the mud.
[02:00:40.944 --> 02:00:43.146]  Sinking into her own excrement.
[02:00:45.762 --> 02:00:46.664]  It's all coming up.
[02:00:47.366 --> 02:00:49.391]  Conservative dissents brewing inside the Vatican.
[02:00:49.431 --> 02:00:50.413]  Huge economic news.
[02:00:50.453 --> 02:00:51.356]  Huge NATO news.
[02:00:52.543 --> 02:00:53.324]  It's all coming up.
[02:00:53.784 --> 02:00:55.505]  Anthony Gucciardi is our guest.
[02:00:56.286 --> 02:00:57.006]  All right, Gucci.
[02:00:57.767 --> 02:01:01.849]  Get into some of these other studies and news we have here ahead of Mr. McAfee joining us.
[02:01:01.869 --> 02:01:03.450]  You talk about all the craziness in the world.
[02:01:03.610 --> 02:01:05.151]  Here's a new report from the CDC.
[02:01:05.191 --> 02:01:08.494]  Three out of four Americans' hearts are older than their chronological age.
[02:01:08.614 --> 02:01:09.955]  It's just a little fun to throw in there.
[02:01:10.395 --> 02:01:13.617]  So you may feel young, but really your heart is totally stressed out.
[02:01:13.637 --> 02:01:16.859]  And that's because I think stress levels... Sleep levels are record low.
[02:01:17.139 --> 02:01:18.260]  Sleep levels are terrible.
[02:01:18.320 --> 02:01:19.021]  No one can sleep.
[02:01:19.061 --> 02:01:21.803]  Everyone's stressing out about life and their job and politics.
[02:01:22.623 --> 02:01:22.983]  Horrible.
[02:01:23.023 --> 02:01:24.504]  It's just, it's affecting everybody.
[02:01:24.824 --> 02:01:26.504]  At the same time though, we have some good news.
[02:01:27.244 --> 02:01:28.385]  Kind of good news, I'll explain it.
[02:01:28.865 --> 02:01:33.926]  California's EPA is going to label Monsanto's Roundup as known to cause cancer.
[02:01:33.966 --> 02:01:35.947]  Put it on the label, that it's known to cause cancer.
[02:01:36.467 --> 02:01:37.808]  Now, here's why this is good.
[02:01:37.828 --> 02:01:40.849]  Now they're open to lawsuits for saying you can drink it for 30 years.
[02:01:40.989 --> 02:01:41.469]  Exactly.
[02:01:41.489 --> 02:01:42.889]  It sets a legal precedent.
[02:01:42.909 --> 02:01:49.111]  The problem is that California, as we know, because we have to come up to their standards, thinks that everything causes cancer.
[02:01:49.391 --> 02:01:52.152]  You know, the shoelaces that you have cause cancer.
[02:01:52.592 --> 02:01:58.054]  But, for the first time, they're actually getting it right, because the World Health Organization agrees that Monsanto's Roundup does cause cancer.
[02:01:58.374 --> 02:01:59.134]  So that's big news.
[02:01:59.175 --> 02:02:06.297]  They're setting a legal precedent, and what could happen now is people could start suing over that, and it could lead to GMO labeling or GMO bans.
[02:02:06.997 --> 02:02:09.318]  Another one... But you mean weed killer might not be good for me?
[02:02:09.458 --> 02:02:09.979]  Weed killer?
[02:02:10.019 --> 02:02:11.939]  You know, you should probably drink a glass of it.
[02:02:11.979 --> 02:02:12.820]  It's perfectly safe.
[02:02:13.060 --> 02:02:14.780]  Why not just drink a glass of glyphosate?
[02:02:14.800 --> 02:02:16.181]  I heard you're shooting yourself with a...
[02:02:17.631 --> 02:02:19.512]  Smith & Wesson 500 is good for you too.
[02:02:19.592 --> 02:02:20.733]  It's actually really good for you.
[02:02:21.153 --> 02:02:23.014]  It's not known to cause cancer or anything.
[02:02:23.634 --> 02:02:24.415]  And then here's one.
[02:02:24.455 --> 02:02:29.478]  So in response to that, Monsanto recruits academics for lobbying war over GMOs from the St.
[02:02:29.518 --> 02:02:30.418]  Louis Business Journal.
[02:02:30.598 --> 02:02:30.718]  Aww.
[02:02:31.199 --> 02:02:39.383]  Monsanto and its partners in the ag industry have pushed to recruit academic researchers to add to their authoritative voice in the ongoing debate of the safety of GMOs.
[02:02:39.743 --> 02:02:46.247]  So they're going to colleges and enlisting professors and, you know, future graduates and stuff to join Monsanto
[02:02:46.667 --> 02:02:47.968]  We talked a lot about this.
[02:02:47.988 --> 02:02:48.929]  This is about the fall of civilization.
[02:03:07.447 --> 02:03:11.188]  So, was it like two years ago, I told you about my doctor friend that runs hospitals.
[02:03:11.528 --> 02:03:13.949]  He told me that there's a big issue on the horizon.
[02:03:13.989 --> 02:03:14.849]  We talked about it on air.
[02:03:15.129 --> 02:03:16.010]  I think we did talk about it on air.
[02:03:16.030 --> 02:03:20.471]  They just don't make all the old drugs that work anymore, because big pharma can't make money off of it.
[02:03:20.511 --> 02:03:20.851]  But yeah.
[02:03:20.991 --> 02:03:23.392]  Tell folks, there's no more snake venom, anti-venom.
[02:03:23.672 --> 02:03:37.341]  Yeah, there's no more snakebite venom being made and Doctors Without Borders is freaking out saying they're gonna run out next year and there's nothing they can do about it and people are gonna die and Big Pharma's like, well, it doesn't really matter because it cost them like 70 grand to make it and you know, who's gonna buy it these days?
[02:03:37.381 --> 02:03:41.024]  They just sit at the hospital except in someone, unless someone gets a snakebite.
[02:03:41.044 --> 02:03:44.606]  So they should only make like 10 a year or whatever, but they just decided not to.
[02:03:44.626 --> 02:03:44.886]  Used to.
[02:03:44.906 --> 02:03:52.852]  20 years ago, they sold rattlesnake antivenom at the stores in New Mexico and Arizona when a friend of mine's mother got bit in Austin by a small
[02:03:54.993 --> 02:03:57.516]  I guess it was a mountain rattler or timber rattler.
[02:03:57.596 --> 02:03:58.477]  It was a little shorter one.
[02:03:58.878 --> 02:03:59.799]  The little ones are the bad ones.
[02:04:00.439 --> 02:04:01.901]  They charged her $200,000 for a two-day stay.
[02:04:01.921 --> 02:04:02.822]  She wasn't even that sick.
[02:04:05.678 --> 02:04:09.019]  70%, it was like 150 grand, I forget, it was 140 grand or something.
[02:04:09.039 --> 02:04:14.240]  I ought to get my friend Don, everybody knows who he is, but I'm not going to say the story unless he wants to do it, for the antivenom.
[02:04:14.700 --> 02:04:16.700]  Yeah, it's like 170 grand sometimes.
[02:04:17.100 --> 02:04:18.341]  It was 140 something for her.
[02:04:18.481 --> 02:04:29.243]  My doctor friend had to go to the zoo and get a vial from 1980 that was expired and inject it into this woman because it was her only hope because they didn't have any snake antidote.
[02:04:29.383 --> 02:04:30.344]  And it just shows the difference.
[02:04:30.404 --> 02:04:32.205]  It always costs money to make this stuff.
[02:04:32.385 --> 02:04:34.427]  But they made big batches and then made their money back.
[02:04:34.807 --> 02:04:35.728]  They just don't care.
[02:04:36.088 --> 02:04:36.789]  They don't care.
[02:04:36.849 --> 02:04:38.950]  They don't care if nuclear reactors are leaking now.
[02:04:38.990 --> 02:04:39.611]  They don't care.
[02:04:39.651 --> 02:04:43.994]  It's all just... It is a nihilistic, destroy-everything situation.
[02:04:44.255 --> 02:04:45.556]  It's literally let people die.
[02:04:45.596 --> 02:04:47.477]  Doesn't matter if there's no profit in it, then who cares?
[02:04:47.917 --> 02:04:48.718]  That's what we're looking at.
[02:04:48.758 --> 02:04:50.339]  That's the situation of this world right now.
[02:04:51.080 --> 02:04:52.281]  That's what it all comes down to.
[02:04:52.581 --> 02:04:53.642]  Total insanity.
[02:04:55.745 --> 02:04:58.150]  Well, what happens when some of these elitists get bit by a snake?
[02:04:58.170 --> 02:04:59.111]  Oh, I'm sure they have plenty.
[02:04:59.232 --> 02:05:00.394]  I'm sure they have plenty of snake venom.
[02:05:02.417 --> 02:05:03.900]  They've got all the antidotes they need.
[02:05:04.982 --> 02:05:06.184]  It really is the end of the West.
[02:05:06.285 --> 02:05:07.467]  I mean, it's the end of the Renaissance.
[02:05:07.507 --> 02:05:07.948]  We'll be back.
[02:05:07.968 --> 02:05:08.328]  Stay with us.
[02:05:09.824 --> 02:05:13.405]  ISIS has demanded that Syrian Christians pay an Islam tax.
[02:05:13.785 --> 02:05:16.006]  This is being reported by WorldNetDaily.
[02:05:16.726 --> 02:05:28.589]  ISIS terrorists gathered together dozens of Christian men in Syria and told them either to pay a Sharia-inspired tax and sign onto a list of faith-based restrictions or pay a penalty that could include the loss of life.
[02:05:29.230 --> 02:05:37.272]  Among the restrictions, Christians cannot own guns, build places of worship, show their crosses in public or even ring church bells.
[02:05:37.972 --> 02:05:45.476]  The terrorists put forth their demands to Christians in a town that used to be dominated by the Christian faith, but has been taken over by radical Muslims.
[02:05:46.157 --> 02:05:53.621]  And while many followers of Islam will condemn these actions, numerous people in power continue to fund groups like ISIS and Al-Qaeda.
[02:05:54.341 --> 02:06:03.833]  Whether it's airdropping grenades or leaving behind billions of dollars worth of vehicles that they can use against us, these terrorist groups always seem to find the best equipment somewhere.
[02:06:04.334 --> 02:06:07.878]  You can find more reports on InfoWars.com

[02:06:21.238 --> 02:06:26.282]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.

[02:08:05.775 --> 02:08:07.076]  Rallying patriots worldwide!
[02:08:20.416 --> 02:08:21.016]  In defense.
[02:08:23.257 --> 02:08:27.400]  Defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[02:08:28.120 --> 02:08:29.621]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:08:34.543 --> 02:08:36.884]  Well everybody knows that I love characters.
[02:08:37.344 --> 02:08:38.425]  I love the real McCoys.
[02:08:39.045 --> 02:08:41.567]  I like Jesse Ventura even though I disagree with some of his politics.
[02:08:41.987 --> 02:08:42.707]  Cause I know him well.
[02:08:42.727 --> 02:08:44.988]  Worked on two seasons of his TV show.
[02:08:45.989 --> 02:08:46.849]  Traveled with him a lot.
[02:08:47.390 --> 02:08:48.010]  He's a real guy.
[02:08:49.665 --> 02:08:52.489]  John McAfee is certainly a character.
[02:08:52.509 --> 02:08:55.133]  Kinda like the real life Captain Morgan.
[02:09:00.473 --> 02:09:02.255]  And John McAfee joins us right now.
[02:09:02.295 --> 02:09:05.277]  He's talking about, or there's been some talk out there, he wants to clarify it.
[02:09:05.297 --> 02:09:08.901]  A little bird told me he might be running for president here in the next few days.
[02:09:09.401 --> 02:09:12.844]  Whoismcafee.com, futuretensecentral.com.
[02:09:13.384 --> 02:09:18.609]  He, of course, worked for NASA in space shuttle studies as an engineer.
[02:09:18.629 --> 02:09:25.115]  Then he founded McAfee Associates, the first big antivirus company, made billions.
[02:09:26.254 --> 02:09:33.881]  And then, of course, he went into the field of bacterial quorum sensing and was also trying to develop nutraceuticals down in Belize, which is a smart business.
[02:09:33.921 --> 02:09:36.283]  That's the business we're in, how we fund our operation.
[02:09:37.524 --> 02:09:38.565]  And they came after him there.
[02:09:38.645 --> 02:09:44.009]  He said that they were producing with the government a chemical weapon.
[02:09:45.168 --> 02:09:47.050]  He named the chemical weapon, Ryacin.
[02:09:47.471 --> 02:09:49.673]  It's a biological system that makes a chemical weapon.
[02:09:49.973 --> 02:09:51.595]  One of the most deadly poisons in the world.
[02:09:52.396 --> 02:09:54.979]  And then sure enough, years later, it came out that indeed was going on.
[02:09:56.180 --> 02:09:58.583]  He says there's attempts on his life, folks have been after him.
[02:10:00.625 --> 02:10:01.767]  A lot's been going on lately.
[02:10:01.787 --> 02:10:03.369]  We'll ask him about some of those events.
[02:10:04.940 --> 02:10:06.361]  But he joins us at the bottom of the hour.
[02:10:06.441 --> 02:10:11.423]  Longer if he wants, but if he does go longer with us, I'm going to have to bring up news stories and get his take on that.
[02:10:11.463 --> 02:10:15.945]  So he's welcome to ride shotgun with us and get into driverless cars and be given part of the road.
[02:10:16.965 --> 02:10:18.846]  The Pope pushing for world government.
[02:10:19.206 --> 02:10:21.527]  NATO chief to make a visit to Ukraine as U.S.
[02:10:21.888 --> 02:10:24.289]  troops and weapons build up for war with Russia.
[02:10:25.109 --> 02:10:25.789]  The numbers are in.
[02:10:25.829 --> 02:10:27.990]  China dumps a record $94 billion in U.S.
[02:10:28.030 --> 02:10:29.031]  Treasuries in one month.
[02:10:29.371 --> 02:10:30.792]  Goldman Sachs says it's probably $115 billion.
[02:10:33.666 --> 02:10:36.267]  Why Obama and Hillary must stop Donald Trump at all costs.
[02:10:36.287 --> 02:10:38.688]  We'll get John McAfee's take on Donald Trump.
[02:10:39.468 --> 02:10:40.669]  All this and more.
[02:10:41.409 --> 02:10:45.291]  But John McAfee, big critic of the NSA, big promoter of liberty.
[02:10:46.796 --> 02:10:50.339]  He's done some tongue-in-cheek videos, music videos with hot girls.
[02:10:50.439 --> 02:10:52.120]  That's some of his humor, folks.
[02:10:53.041 --> 02:10:57.504]  But like him or love him, he certainly is an American phenomenon.
[02:10:58.164 --> 02:11:00.386]  And John McAfee, thank you for coming on with us.
[02:11:00.446 --> 02:11:03.208]  It was great going shooting with you here in Austin with the .50 cal.
[02:11:04.389 --> 02:11:06.791]  You did a lot better hand-held shooting that baby than I did.
[02:11:06.831 --> 02:11:08.733]  You looked like it was part of your body.
[02:11:08.934 --> 02:11:11.796]  Me, I looked like an overweight goblin firing a cannon.
[02:11:11.816 --> 02:11:14.439]  But we'll maybe roll some of that in the background.
[02:11:14.459 --> 02:11:17.322]  You guys can Google John McAvee fires 50 cal.
[02:11:17.982 --> 02:11:21.846]  But John, good to have you here with us via video Skype.
[02:11:22.727 --> 02:11:26.571]  You're talking about running for president, or I've heard people are talking about you running for president.
[02:11:27.011 --> 02:11:28.513]  What's the real scoop, John?
[02:11:30.302 --> 02:11:36.586]  Well, a number of people have been advising me to run, urging me to run.
[02:11:38.067 --> 02:11:41.730]  My team actually filed today formally.
[02:11:41.750 --> 02:11:44.392]  I'm still not convinced.
[02:11:44.412 --> 02:11:45.873]  I would rather someone with more
[02:11:48.281 --> 02:11:52.545]  of intelligence and charisma be the carrier of the banner here.
[02:11:53.186 --> 02:12:00.933]  But I feel that the government has failed us in many ways, Alex, and something has to be done about it.
[02:12:01.874 --> 02:12:03.415]  Whether it's me or whether it's someone else.
[02:12:04.176 --> 02:12:06.538]  Wow, so it sounds like you're 99% there.
[02:12:06.558 --> 02:12:09.421]  Did you just say, I mean, please make a statement now.
[02:12:10.101 --> 02:12:13.725]  You are looking at filing and running for president officially?
[02:12:15.441 --> 02:12:15.981]  Well, no.
[02:12:16.382 --> 02:12:20.623]  I said my advisors and my staff filed formally today.
[02:12:20.643 --> 02:12:26.205]  I think that's a very subtle way of forcing me to do something.
[02:12:29.106 --> 02:12:33.967]  I'm still undecided, Alex, and within the next 48 hours I will make a decision one way or the other.
[02:12:33.987 --> 02:12:34.768]  So there's your headline.
[02:12:34.808 --> 02:12:41.190]  John McAfee has filed for president, but they're kind of like half-pregnant now.
[02:12:41.570 --> 02:12:44.231]  We'll decide in the next 48 hours if indeed that's going to happen.
[02:12:46.438 --> 02:12:48.840]  Well, again, it has been filed.
[02:12:49.380 --> 02:12:50.261]  I have not decided.
[02:12:50.301 --> 02:12:51.061]  That is the truth of it.
[02:12:51.742 --> 02:12:55.625]  Okay, so basically folks are trying to force your hand, but you're undecided.
[02:12:56.705 --> 02:12:57.426]  I am undecided.
[02:12:57.446 --> 02:12:59.127]  Alright.
[02:12:59.147 --> 02:13:00.808]  There are a bunch of reasons, obviously.
[02:13:01.328 --> 02:13:06.472]  I am quite a character in terms of the way the press portrays me.
[02:13:08.393 --> 02:13:10.715]  And yet, I speak what I see as the truth.
[02:13:12.160 --> 02:13:16.425]  I've written a number of articles in the past year criticizing both the U.S.
[02:13:16.465 --> 02:13:25.495]  government and foreign governments for invasions of privacy, for incompetence in terms of understanding the very society in which they're living in.
[02:13:27.472 --> 02:13:36.579]  We're living in a cyber world now, a world based on technology that certainly our current administration does not understand in the least.
[02:13:38.360 --> 02:13:42.844]  They propose utterly insane concepts like
[02:13:44.595 --> 02:13:45.515]  Banning encryption.
[02:13:46.336 --> 02:13:50.960]  Encryption is nothing more than the modern version of whispering in someone's ear.
[02:13:51.160 --> 02:13:52.902]  I can whisper in my wife's ear at dinner.
[02:13:52.922 --> 02:13:54.563]  That's okay.
[02:13:54.603 --> 02:13:59.167]  But I can't whisper to her over the internet because people want to make that illegal.
[02:13:59.888 --> 02:14:01.610]  They want to put back doors in software.
[02:14:02.470 --> 02:14:08.095]  That will make it a thousand times easier for hackers to get in and steal your data.
[02:14:08.596 --> 02:14:09.797]  Which is happening all the time.
[02:14:10.829 --> 02:14:20.236]  The hack of the Office of Program Management in the U.S., which put literally millions of covert U.S.
[02:14:20.376 --> 02:14:30.844]  agents at risk, that put their lives at risk, are incompetence, and it shows a total lack of understanding of the technology which underlies this entire society, Alex.
[02:14:32.930 --> 02:14:41.656]  Well, break down your presidential platform if you do decide to run, if you feel that you are basically being forced to because of the developments towards tyranny.
[02:14:41.676 --> 02:14:51.182]  I mean, in your own words, what would you do as president within the constitutional constraints, versus if you were king for a year, what would you do?
[02:14:53.800 --> 02:14:56.863]  I would do something totally different if I were king for a year, I'm sure.
[02:14:56.883 --> 02:15:01.706]  I think my first priority would be privacy, Alex.
[02:15:02.206 --> 02:15:03.207]  We have none anymore.
[02:15:03.227 --> 02:15:05.268]  The NSA is spying on us.
[02:15:05.288 --> 02:15:07.010]  The CIA is spying on us.
[02:15:07.410 --> 02:15:15.315]  All 16 government covert agencies have technology that is beyond belief, that can listen to our phone conversations.
[02:15:16.756 --> 02:15:20.099]  Just drive down the street in any city and look at the cameras.
[02:15:20.959 --> 02:15:21.760]  Thousands of them.
[02:15:22.403 --> 02:15:24.404]  You know, 15 or 20 per block.
[02:15:24.944 --> 02:15:25.465]  Moveable.
[02:15:25.985 --> 02:15:27.926]  They can watch you as you're moving.
[02:15:27.946 --> 02:15:29.667]  They can recognize your face.
[02:15:31.828 --> 02:15:32.528]  We've lost it.
[02:15:32.789 --> 02:15:34.970]  And without privacy, what do we have, Alex?
[02:15:35.030 --> 02:15:36.230]  We don't have our humanity.
[02:15:37.211 --> 02:15:38.191]  Privacy is a choice.
[02:15:38.231 --> 02:15:40.673]  We choose what to reveal to people.
[02:15:42.994 --> 02:15:48.517]  The grocery clerk at the store, you might be comfortable saying, you know, hey, you know, I went fishing yesterday.
[02:15:49.127 --> 02:15:51.188]  But you're not going to tell them your deepest secrets.
[02:15:51.868 --> 02:15:58.950]  Every day, every moment, when we meet someone, we choose the level of privacy that we wish to maintain.
[02:15:59.950 --> 02:16:01.911]  Without that choice, what do we have?
[02:16:01.931 --> 02:16:03.991]  You know, we have 1984.
[02:16:08.372 --> 02:16:10.793]  So your candidacy would be the opposite of 1984.
[02:16:11.313 --> 02:16:13.034]  You would attempt to, what, bring in 1776?
[02:16:15.290 --> 02:16:15.590]  I would.
[02:16:15.670 --> 02:16:21.155]  I would like us to go back to the concept that the Founding Fathers had, which is freedom.
[02:16:22.315 --> 02:16:29.581]  Our freedoms are being removed because we were told if we give up a few freedoms, then we will have security and safety.
[02:16:30.305 --> 02:16:34.546]  But, you know, I'm 70 years old and I can promise you there is no safety in life.
[02:16:34.646 --> 02:16:37.547]  And if there is, we have to provide it for ourselves.
[02:16:38.368 --> 02:16:39.688]  You know, the government cannot do it.
[02:16:39.988 --> 02:16:41.268]  An agency cannot do it.
[02:16:41.689 --> 02:16:45.330]  No outside party can provide security and safety for us.
[02:16:46.410 --> 02:16:58.334]  And by giving up the freedoms and the rights that were given to us through the Constitution and were ordained by the Founding Fathers are being eroded daily.
[02:16:59.264 --> 02:17:02.085]  No, I'm not a politician and people don't account me for that.
[02:17:02.145 --> 02:17:13.250]  But politics, if you look in Merriam-Webster, politics is merely the activities and the policies that people use to gain power and keep power within a government.
[02:17:13.970 --> 02:17:16.692]  And isn't it politics that got us in the mess we're in now?
[02:17:17.312 --> 02:17:26.596]  Special interests, people more concerned about maintaining their power, maintaining their position within government, than in actually serving the American people.
[02:17:27.761 --> 02:17:31.362]  So I think we need to get back to the basics, to get back to the purpose of government.
[02:17:31.702 --> 02:17:32.702]  You know, government is not here.
[02:17:32.822 --> 02:17:33.642]  I don't need a father.
[02:17:34.282 --> 02:17:35.043]  I don't need a mother.
[02:17:35.223 --> 02:17:37.203]  I don't need someone to tell me how to live.
[02:17:38.103 --> 02:17:39.764]  I can make those choices on my own.
[02:17:39.964 --> 02:17:40.784]  Well, I know this.
[02:17:40.804 --> 02:17:54.527]  If they're going to have eight or nine different Republicans up there, a bunch of them just total politicians, I would love to see a Jesse Ventura or a John McAfee up there with them, staring it up like Trump's done, because regardless what you think about Trump, I think he has
[02:17:55.538 --> 02:17:56.878]  Shaking up the political process.
[02:17:56.918 --> 02:17:58.299]  What's your view on Donald Trump?
[02:17:58.999 --> 02:18:00.339]  You know, I admire Donald Trump.
[02:18:00.379 --> 02:18:00.859]  I really do.
[02:18:00.879 --> 02:18:05.821]  You know, he makes common sense.
[02:18:05.881 --> 02:18:07.041]  He is not a politician.
[02:18:07.341 --> 02:18:07.861]  That's clear.
[02:18:07.881 --> 02:18:13.322]  You know, if I have any fault with him at all, it's, hey, what's with the hair, Donald?
[02:18:13.963 --> 02:18:16.503]  But I'm saying that in jest.
[02:18:16.983 --> 02:18:18.444]  But I admire Donald Trump.
[02:18:18.484 --> 02:18:23.645]  And I think that he has courage to stand up and do what he's doing.
[02:18:26.155 --> 02:18:35.582]  You know, at first they say he didn't have a shot, and I thought he might have been a shill for Hillary or Jeb or something, but I think he really wants to win, and his whole company's based on service industry.
[02:18:36.102 --> 02:18:37.583]  He won't do well in a depression.
[02:18:38.124 --> 02:18:46.490]  I think he's an old-fashioned entrepreneur and actually loves America more and more, and I think he's got problems, but I think he doesn't like seeing this country fall apart.
[02:18:47.190 --> 02:18:51.152]  Because the globalists wouldn't say, make America great again and admit we were in trouble.
[02:18:51.653 --> 02:18:58.116]  A globalist candidate wouldn't do the things he's doing, admitting we're being invaded by illegals that we give free handouts to.
[02:18:58.697 --> 02:19:06.401]  I mean, that's why he must be for real, because even if he himself isn't, what he's saying is devastating to the establishment.
[02:19:07.964 --> 02:19:08.824]  Well, of course.
[02:19:08.904 --> 02:19:11.165]  I think someone needs to say the things that he's saying.
[02:19:11.565 --> 02:19:14.306]  Because our government has failed.
[02:19:14.906 --> 02:19:19.727]  I mean, it is a dysfunctional government in every respect.
[02:19:20.927 --> 02:19:28.609]  And when a government becomes dysfunctional, then all aspects of its services and all of its departments also become dysfunctional.
[02:19:29.109 --> 02:19:30.029]  Someone has to say it.
[02:19:30.690 --> 02:19:31.870]  I've been saying it for years.
[02:19:32.689 --> 02:19:33.410]  You've been saying it.
[02:19:35.912 --> 02:19:38.435]  So I admire him for doing that.
[02:19:39.596 --> 02:19:41.498]  Don't discount Trump.
[02:19:41.758 --> 02:19:43.960]  I think he's going to be a very powerful player.
[02:19:44.160 --> 02:19:47.884]  Sure, well what it really shows too is that what he's saying is popular.
[02:19:48.224 --> 02:19:50.006]  In major polls he's now beating Hillary.
[02:19:50.526 --> 02:19:51.267]  Which is what I've said.
[02:19:51.287 --> 02:19:55.271]  The average Democrat doesn't have a suicide wish for the country and want to be bankrupt.
[02:19:55.712 --> 02:19:57.093]  They're sick of political correctness.
[02:19:57.654 --> 02:19:59.776]  I mean, the Democrats of JFK were great people.
[02:19:59.836 --> 02:20:01.138]  Who are these new Democrats?
[02:20:01.518 --> 02:20:03.080]  And who are these Republicans that work with them?
[02:20:03.360 --> 02:20:05.022]  John McAvee may be running for president.
[02:20:05.362 --> 02:20:06.423]  He joins us now.
[02:20:06.443 --> 02:20:09.287]  We're going to come back and walk through some of the world events with him.

[02:24:00.008 --> 02:24:00.388]  Don't wait.

[02:24:42.020 --> 02:24:44.501]  Come on, come on, come on, baby.
[02:24:44.561 --> 02:24:46.601]  Come on, come on, come on.
[02:24:47.662 --> 02:24:51.943]  Fun part about this job is I get to interview people like Ted Nugent and John McAfee.
[02:24:53.624 --> 02:24:56.684]  Hell, Ted Nugent's called in a few times before on the hotline and gotten in.
[02:24:56.704 --> 02:25:01.946]  But ever since his wife got arrested with a gun going to the Dallas airport, he's like, I'll come on later, Alex.
[02:25:02.766 --> 02:25:03.827]  I got his cell phone number.
[02:25:03.867 --> 02:25:07.628]  I'm going to call Ted Nugent today and say, you're going to come on now, buddy.
[02:25:08.686 --> 02:25:19.134]  I know he got in a lot of trouble on the show for admitting that Gun Owners of America had put major heat on the NRA to make them more hardcore because he is a board member of the NRA.
[02:25:19.154 --> 02:25:21.776]  But that's why I like Ted Nugent is he's real.
[02:25:23.271 --> 02:25:24.612]  And I've done nothing against the NRA.
[02:25:24.652 --> 02:25:26.212]  They used to be really bad ten years ago.
[02:25:26.652 --> 02:25:27.613]  Now they're really good.
[02:25:28.413 --> 02:25:32.715]  We've got to radicalize the Liberty Movement because we face a radical globalist threat.
[02:25:33.255 --> 02:25:34.696]  Milk toasting it won't beat it.
[02:25:35.396 --> 02:25:40.458]  John McAfee, what is the best website for folks to visit to find out more if you're about to run for president?
[02:25:42.379 --> 02:25:48.681]  I think my people have McAfee16.com as the main website.
[02:25:49.021 --> 02:25:49.441]  Oh really?
[02:25:49.481 --> 02:25:50.402]  Have you launched that yet?
[02:25:52.903 --> 02:25:54.305]  The website is up, yes.
[02:25:54.485 --> 02:25:55.025]  Oh my gosh!
[02:25:55.106 --> 02:25:56.427]  McAfee16.com!
[02:25:56.787 --> 02:25:57.948]  Are we getting the exclusive?
[02:25:57.968 --> 02:25:59.029]  Because I hadn't heard this yet.
[02:25:59.049 --> 02:26:04.615]  Are you exclusively letting us know that you may fly your flag and run for El Presidente?
[02:26:05.516 --> 02:26:15.605]  Well, I think, I talked to a friend of mine at International Business Times, and one of my campaign people, I think, called him.
[02:26:16.440 --> 02:26:19.981]  I'm a big fan of Rand Paul because I know he's for real.
[02:26:20.061 --> 02:26:20.801]  I just wish that
[02:26:42.884 --> 02:26:48.788]  It's not helping him to attack Donald Trump with his constituents, and then he's being too milquetoast on the immigrant thing.
[02:26:48.808 --> 02:26:59.015]  I mean, John, you're married to a black lady, you've lived all over the world, you're all for great immigrants, so am I, but should Americans have to pay for anchor babies and 40 million illegals?
[02:26:59.295 --> 02:27:02.057]  Should Europe have to pay for the Middle Eastern refugees?
[02:27:02.517 --> 02:27:05.419]  From war, Saudi Arabia starts, but they won't take one refugee?
[02:27:07.037 --> 02:27:13.339]  Well, I think one of the other problems that we face here in America is that people are not taking responsibility for their own lives.
[02:27:15.080 --> 02:27:22.803]  If I didn't want to work, for example, if I could make up some excuse for not being able to work and the government would give me money.
[02:27:24.544 --> 02:27:35.688]  There's something fundamentally wrong, not with helping people, but with creating the attitude that I don't have to worry about anything because someone will take care of me.
[02:27:36.294 --> 02:27:38.195]  It's like, you know, living at home when you're 40.
[02:27:38.495 --> 02:27:42.337]  You know, your mom and dad will still take care of you and your mom will cook for you.
[02:27:42.677 --> 02:27:43.158]  Exactly!
[02:27:43.178 --> 02:27:52.923]  These illegals, but also other deadbeats and people, I'm all for helping someone with a broken back, they're like 40-year-old spoiled brats telling their mom to make them breakfast and dinner and wash their underwear.
[02:27:53.343 --> 02:27:54.244]  It's disgusting!
[02:27:54.404 --> 02:28:02.088]  That's what I'm so angry about, is that people just expect all this while hard-working Americans of every race, color, and creed are going bankrupt, John!
[02:28:03.100 --> 02:28:07.322]  Well, I don't think the problem is simply immigrants.
[02:28:07.482 --> 02:28:14.446]  I mean, there are many natural born Americans that are taking advantage of the same system.
[02:28:14.466 --> 02:28:15.486]  I agree.
[02:28:15.526 --> 02:28:20.389]  So, America was actually founded on the concept of, you know, give us your poor, your hungry, your judged.
[02:28:25.007 --> 02:28:26.147]  Uh, and it worked pretty well.
[02:28:26.567 --> 02:28:29.408]  It's just that we're doing a very bad job of managing that.
[02:28:29.488 --> 02:28:35.989]  Well, sure, we took the poor, the hungry, and put them into piratical, swashbuckling, hella situations, and a lot of folks died.
[02:28:36.509 --> 02:28:40.570]  And this was basically like an alien boot camp, like Australia, a penal colony.
[02:28:40.890 --> 02:28:44.811]  But people weren't given anything, that's why we were the best, because we weren't tough as nails.
[02:28:46.111 --> 02:28:47.672]  Right.
[02:28:47.812 --> 02:28:49.212]  Again, we have to get back to basics.
[02:28:49.612 --> 02:28:53.513]  We are all responsible for ourselves, for our families, for our loved ones.
[02:28:55.348 --> 02:28:59.052]  And we must take back our own lives.
[02:28:59.473 --> 02:29:02.636]  We must take back our freedoms because many of those are missing now.
[02:29:02.656 --> 02:29:06.860]  We have to take back privacy because that's eroding at an alarming rate.
[02:29:07.381 --> 02:29:08.722]  I'm not sure any of it exists.
[02:29:08.782 --> 02:29:12.166]  I'm not sure that, especially someone like you and I,
[02:29:13.096 --> 02:29:17.662]  There's probably not a single conversation that you have that is not monitored by some covert agency.
[02:29:17.742 --> 02:29:18.583]  Of course, they admit it.
[02:29:19.124 --> 02:29:24.350]  We're going to go to Brigham to come back and give you the floor to really go through your platform and be uninterrupted for about 5-10 minutes.
[02:29:24.370 --> 02:29:27.834]  Then I want to maybe take some phone calls for you and cover some news if you're okay with that.
[02:29:28.835 --> 02:29:34.037]  Think about this, I want to come back and get your answer, John McAfee, McAfee16.com.
[02:29:34.778 --> 02:29:38.940]  It's like being a kept woman, or I guess a kept man nowadays, rich women with boyfriends.
[02:29:39.640 --> 02:29:42.781]  Are you really free when somebody else controls your whole life and pays the bills?
[02:29:43.482 --> 02:29:45.262]  And that's what all this welfare state is about.
[02:29:45.923 --> 02:29:47.323]  I mean, this is about enslaving us.
[02:29:47.383 --> 02:29:49.224]  John McAfee is our guest.
[02:29:49.284 --> 02:29:50.965]  He has filed for president.
[02:29:52.276 --> 02:29:52.917]  Is he running?
[02:29:53.397 --> 02:29:57.459]  International Business Times just broke it in print today that he's looking at it.
[02:29:57.499 --> 02:29:59.040]  We're breaking it via the actual interview.
[02:29:59.080 --> 02:29:59.961]  We're on the march.
[02:30:00.461 --> 02:30:02.042]  The empire's on the run.
[02:30:02.983 --> 02:30:05.364]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:05.384 --> 02:30:07.345]  I was quiet yesterday and let them scoop us.
[02:30:07.405 --> 02:30:08.406]  See how good I am?
[02:30:09.995 --> 02:30:14.999]  Over the Labor Day weekend, we had reports of 8 being killed and 46 being wounded.
[02:30:15.439 --> 02:30:19.442]  July 4th of this year, we had reports of 9 dead and 53 wounded.
[02:30:19.943 --> 02:30:25.827]  And let us not forget, July 4th of last year, we had reports of 14 killed and 82 shot.
[02:30:26.327 --> 02:30:28.229]  And these are not nationwide stats.
[02:30:28.729 --> 02:30:34.734]  All of these numbers come from the city of Chicago, the city with some of the strictest gun laws in the nation.
[02:30:35.234 --> 02:30:39.939]  Which is to say, if criminals expect you to be unarmed, they're more likely to attack you.
[02:30:40.359 --> 02:30:44.643]  Not to mention the fact that much of this violence is linked to gangs or drug activity.
[02:30:45.124 --> 02:30:51.990]  Meaning that for all the gun buybacks and anti-gun commercials, criminals just haven't decided to turn in their firearms.
[02:30:52.791 --> 02:30:57.576]  And I understand that police have many responsibilities and they can't be every place at once.
[02:30:57.916 --> 02:31:01.800]  But that's why you have a Second Amendment so you'll be able to protect yourself.
[02:31:02.361 --> 02:31:05.905]  You can find more reports on InfoWars.com
[02:31:09.628 --> 02:31:15.232]  Supermail Vitality is InfoWarsLife.com's number one selling product for a good reason.

[02:32:43.588 --> 02:32:47.571]  Introducing the new Infowarslife.com oil of oregano formulation.
[02:32:47.751 --> 02:32:52.534]  We have now procured the most high quality and potent forms of oregano oil on the market.

[02:33:04.302 --> 02:33:06.123]  That's Infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[02:33:23.756 --> 02:33:29.840]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[02:33:30.500 --> 02:33:32.162]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:38.180 --> 02:33:40.262]  I want to do the same thing with my target.
[02:33:40.342 --> 02:33:42.064]  I'll hit it point blank every time.
[02:33:42.084 --> 02:33:43.325]  I'm sure every shot is going to be a success.
[02:33:43.345 --> 02:33:43.665]  Perfect.
[02:33:43.865 --> 02:33:44.246]  That's right.
[02:34:01.630 --> 02:34:03.151]  We just went out there real quick and shot.
[02:34:04.432 --> 02:34:07.994]  He was hitting bullseye at about 400 yards in his first shots.
[02:34:08.294 --> 02:34:12.576]  Well, John, it's daytime and these armor-piercing tracers, U.S.
[02:34:12.777 --> 02:34:15.558]  Army issue, won't be as spectacular as nighttime.
[02:34:16.119 --> 02:34:17.840]  But you want to shoot a couple of these?
[02:34:18.020 --> 02:34:18.440]  Absolutely.
[02:34:18.920 --> 02:34:20.081]  All right, we'll do that next.
[02:34:20.101 --> 02:34:22.642]  A little over a year ago, see, I've lost about 60 pounds.
[02:34:41.554 --> 02:34:43.075]  Why are they firing them handheld?
[02:34:43.095 --> 02:34:45.797]  That's the whole point.
[02:34:46.477 --> 02:34:48.978]  I'm shooting a tree about two yards away right there doing that.
[02:34:49.639 --> 02:34:52.060]  It's too dry to fire tracers.
[02:34:53.681 --> 02:34:57.504]  Look at that man rapid firing the .50 handheld.
[02:34:57.524 --> 02:34:58.284]  I like these .50s.
[02:34:58.884 --> 02:34:59.565]  My type of gun.
[02:35:00.585 --> 02:35:03.667]  John, you just got done shooting the .50 over there.
[02:35:03.687 --> 02:35:07.449]  We're gonna put that on the TV show next week, but right now you've got that .223.
[02:35:09.418 --> 02:35:11.860]  M4 Scorpion, you ready to try it out?
[02:35:12.281 --> 02:35:15.463]  I don't even know what's here compared to the .50 caliber, this feels like a feather.
[02:35:15.483 --> 02:35:19.567]  That's right, you just hand-held and shot the heavy .50 over there.
[02:35:20.147 --> 02:35:21.689]  This is a shot on my iPhone.
[02:35:21.789 --> 02:35:23.750]  Alright, that's good.
[02:35:24.531 --> 02:35:25.512]  He just came on the show.
[02:35:25.532 --> 02:35:26.333]  He's been on a few times.
[02:35:26.353 --> 02:35:29.035]  We thought, hey, let's drive out to Steiner's Ranch, the real Steiner Ranch.
[02:35:29.516 --> 02:35:33.780]  Not their housing development, but their real 12,000 acre ranch outside town.
[02:35:34.521 --> 02:35:37.404]  And it reminds me, I need to take the kids out there and do some more shooting.
[02:35:38.124 --> 02:35:40.286]  But John McAfee is our guest.
[02:35:40.687 --> 02:35:47.854]  Exciting to think of him running for president, just to inject the ideas of privacy, to use as a bully pulpit to expose what the NSA is doing.
[02:35:48.334 --> 02:35:55.881]  Remember, we've gone from just eight, nine years ago, them denying the NSA was spying on anybody, to admitting total surveillance, which is completely illegal.
[02:35:56.682 --> 02:35:59.945]  The toll-free number to join us on air, your chance to talk to John McAfee is 800-259-9231.
[02:35:59.965 --> 02:36:00.025]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:36:00.045 --> 02:36:04.309]  Now, I'm normally very lenient about plugs and other issues and going down rabbit trails,
[02:36:12.236 --> 02:36:18.925]  We're talking about John McAfee running for President and any of the issues he covers, which is a wide open field, but it better be on those subjects.
[02:36:19.306 --> 02:36:28.338]  John McAfee, M-C-A-F-E-E, McAfee16.com, running for El Presidente, or he's at least got one foot in the race right now.
[02:36:28.838 --> 02:36:29.700]  Guard against the...
[02:36:31.900 --> 02:36:35.081]  Impostors of Pretended Patriotism, George Washington.
[02:36:35.501 --> 02:36:38.662]  A nice George Washington quote up there on the site.
[02:36:39.082 --> 02:36:41.742]  So entrepreneur, scientist, engineer, John McAvee.
[02:36:42.142 --> 02:36:44.463]  Looks like he's getting ready to plunge into the 2016 race.
[02:36:44.943 --> 02:36:52.865]  Before I go any further and then ask you that question I just got to a moment ago, I'm going to plug our sponsorship, what funds us, we're going to go right back to you.
[02:36:52.885 --> 02:36:57.086]  But then I want to ask you just briefly, well, we'll get there in a moment.
[02:36:57.706 --> 02:36:59.067]  Deep Cleanse is back in.
[02:36:59.787 --> 02:37:00.567]  It had been out for
[02:37:01.798 --> 02:37:02.338]  Three months.
[02:37:03.059 --> 02:37:04.580]  Liver Shield have been out for three months.
[02:37:05.540 --> 02:37:09.162]  Super high quality, concentrated herbs known to detoxify the body.
[02:37:09.582 --> 02:37:12.324]  Also zeolites and other things known to drag out toxins.
[02:37:12.864 --> 02:37:15.945]  Deep Cleanse will be available for another week or so at current sales rates.
[02:37:16.726 --> 02:37:20.288]  I can tell you Liver Cleanse, if you want to do the Liver Cleanse, I'm going to hold back some bottles for myself.
[02:37:21.028 --> 02:37:34.735]  You do it, the six-day-long cleanse with the oxy powder and with the apple cider vinegar and then some of the epsom salts in caplets on the last day with olive oil and you just flush out all these stones out of your gallbladder.
[02:37:35.315 --> 02:37:37.176]  I didn't believe it until I did it over a year ago.
[02:37:37.196 --> 02:37:38.296]  It is just incredible.
[02:37:38.736 --> 02:37:42.978]  So, InfoWarsLife.com, deep cleanses back in stock.
[02:37:43.839 --> 02:37:45.640]  We want to keep this stuff in stock all the time.
[02:37:46.881 --> 02:37:48.922]  But you never know what folks are going to be into.
[02:37:48.982 --> 02:37:51.625]  So people are really into Deep Cleanse and Deliver Cleanse.
[02:37:51.945 --> 02:37:53.526]  So if you want to get those, now is the time.
[02:37:53.566 --> 02:37:55.648]  And your purchase supports the broadcast.
[02:37:55.668 --> 02:37:59.451]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:37:59.772 --> 02:38:03.695]  And then finally, Knockout is back.
[02:38:04.876 --> 02:38:06.598]  And I talked about it with Anthony in the last hour.
[02:38:06.618 --> 02:38:09.920]  We ought to take that video and post it on the site so folks get a breakdown.
[02:38:09.980 --> 02:38:13.844]  But it's got GA, BA, Gamma,
[02:38:17.009 --> 02:38:22.971]  Ambiotic acid that helps trigger everything and give it the enzymes it needs to activates what I've been told.
[02:38:23.571 --> 02:38:32.553]  L-phenanine, hops flower extract, lemon balm leaf extract, valerian root extract, chamomile flower extract, L-tryptophan, and melatonin.
[02:38:33.013 --> 02:38:38.375]  That's the same cost as getting valerian root or melatonin with similar dosages by itself.
[02:38:38.395 --> 02:38:40.955]  I mean it's got the dose that's in other stuff.
[02:38:41.355 --> 02:38:43.316]  Three milligrams of melatonin,
[02:38:44.396 --> 02:38:46.678]  30 milligrams of valerian root, stuff like that.
[02:38:46.698 --> 02:38:56.788]  100 milligrams of L-theanine, 75 of hops flower, lemon balm 45, valerian root as I mentioned, chamomile flower extract 18 milligrams.
[02:38:59.050 --> 02:39:06.517]  It'll knock you out and in my experience get real sleep but not be groggy in the morning because sleeping pills artificially knock you out.
[02:39:07.793 --> 02:39:09.394]  They don't put you in the true deep sleep.
[02:39:09.894 --> 02:39:11.536]  Well, this in my experience does.
[02:39:11.556 --> 02:39:15.238]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:39:15.458 --> 02:39:20.902]  And we did sell out of the Hillary Clinton shirt, Hillary Clinton for Prison 2016.
[02:39:21.882 --> 02:39:25.345]  But the good news is, the next truck gets here in two days, made here in America.
[02:39:25.625 --> 02:39:26.746]  So we're keeping it up for sale.
[02:39:26.786 --> 02:39:29.488]  For all intents and purposes, it is sold out, but it's really not.
[02:39:29.908 --> 02:39:31.189]  You just won't get it in three, four days.
[02:39:31.209 --> 02:39:32.089]  You'll get it like in a week.
[02:39:33.230 --> 02:39:35.632]  So again, Hillary for Prison t-shirt.
[02:39:36.272 --> 02:39:37.152]  In all sizes.
[02:39:37.552 --> 02:39:39.053]  On the back it says legalized freedom.
[02:39:39.413 --> 02:39:41.053]  Great way to spark conversations.
[02:39:41.574 --> 02:39:44.414]  Okay, so how do we battle domestication?
[02:39:45.475 --> 02:39:48.516]  How do we battle not being made dependent on the system?
[02:39:49.016 --> 02:39:50.156]  And then, that's a good question.
[02:39:50.216 --> 02:39:53.877]  What is your take on Benghazi, the Hillary emails, and what she's been up to?
[02:39:53.897 --> 02:39:58.759]  Well, first I'd like to add, I'd like to say one thing.
[02:39:59.259 --> 02:40:02.340]  If I do decide to run, I am going to run to win.
[02:40:02.640 --> 02:40:03.600]  And I know that sounds
[02:40:04.281 --> 02:40:15.928]  Very odd from someone like me, but keep in mind, I've been in technology, a leader of technology for over 40 years, ever since the computer was first invented.
[02:40:15.948 --> 02:40:22.992]  40% of every corporate employee is involved in one or other aspect of computer technology.
[02:40:23.933 --> 02:40:30.577]  I went to DEF CON last month, which is the annual hacker high technology crowd
[02:40:31.024 --> 02:40:37.339]  I was swamped wherever I went, with people wanting autographs, people wanting pictures with me, people begging me to run for president.
[02:40:37.379 --> 02:40:38.461]  Yeah, you've got a household name.
[02:40:38.481 --> 02:40:39.383]  You've got the name cred.
[02:40:40.285 --> 02:40:51.091]  Right, and oddly enough, there are probably 45 million people out there that, you know, many of them who have never voted before.
[02:40:51.491 --> 02:40:54.732]  I guarantee you that if I run, they will get out and vote for me.
[02:40:55.353 --> 02:41:01.096]  It sounds insane, but... No, you're saying you're a serious candidate, it's a serious candidate to see you could win.
[02:41:02.316 --> 02:41:05.278]  If I choose to run, I will definitely win, there is no question.
[02:41:06.397 --> 02:41:15.645]  Wow, well break it down for us more, because I've been interrupting, we've been going back and forth, you're good at that, but you've got the floor, tell us what you're planning to do, what you'd like to do if you run for president.
[02:41:17.507 --> 02:41:26.655]  Okay, my campaign manager has said that he will break both of my kneecaps if I say anything specific, Alex, so we're going to have to talk in generalities here.
[02:41:28.257 --> 02:41:32.801]  Again, as I said before, my first priority is to return privacy.
[02:41:33.770 --> 02:41:42.835]  It's being stolen by the government, it's being stolen by hackers because the government has made it easy for hackers to do so.
[02:41:42.855 --> 02:41:45.196]  That's my first priority.
[02:41:45.897 --> 02:41:49.619]  And beyond that, it's to bring us all back to a state of freedom.
[02:41:50.919 --> 02:41:54.141]  We do not need a father figure as a government.
[02:41:55.013 --> 02:42:08.496]  If you look at the number of government employees, compared to the number of American plain citizens, it's reaching an astronomically large percentage.
[02:42:09.917 --> 02:42:12.577]  And we're spending trillions of dollars for what?
[02:42:13.037 --> 02:42:23.020]  Governments should be created by people, for people, to build roads, create schools, to do this in a national defense.
[02:42:23.929 --> 02:42:28.552]  Governments should not be inside our bedrooms looking at what we're doing when we're alone with our wives.
[02:42:28.572 --> 02:42:32.374]  They should not be on the telephone listening to every word that we speak.
[02:42:32.834 --> 02:42:34.415]  They should not be following us around.
[02:42:34.855 --> 02:42:38.217]  They should not be trying to find out who our friends are and what our friends are doing.
[02:42:38.918 --> 02:42:41.659]  This is really the fundamental problem.
[02:42:43.040 --> 02:42:49.624]  To get back to a state where every man, woman, or at least every adult is responsible for themselves.
[02:42:50.239 --> 02:42:59.387]  And takes responsibility for their own actions rather than going, well, you know, it's easier if the government takes care of me, so I'll give up this bit of privacy or that bit of freedom.
[02:43:01.068 --> 02:43:07.214]  Again, the specifics I cannot tell you at this point because I need both my kneecaps to walk, Alex.
[02:43:08.257 --> 02:43:12.980]  I understand, and that's normal to then start launching your actual platform after you've announced.
[02:43:13.981 --> 02:43:15.442]  You committed some thought crimes there.
[02:43:15.462 --> 02:43:18.143]  I want to talk about Caitlyn Jenner, political correctness, all the rest of it.
[02:43:18.183 --> 02:43:22.346]  I mean, I know you're a classical liberal and that you're live and let live, but don't tell you how to live.
[02:43:23.107 --> 02:43:27.770]  In public schools nationwide, he or she is off the questionnaires.
[02:43:27.890 --> 02:43:33.413]  You don't say boy or girl, father or mother, husband or wife, because the very existence of that is hurtful to someone.
[02:43:33.894 --> 02:43:37.136]  That sounds like a Kurt Vonnegut satire book from the fifties.
[02:43:37.916 --> 02:43:39.657]  About the left killing an attorney.
[02:43:39.677 --> 02:43:46.041]  It doesn't sound like reality, but you just said the right to not know what's happening with you and your wife in your bedroom.
[02:43:46.602 --> 02:43:48.483]  How dare you use the word wife?
[02:43:48.543 --> 02:43:49.343]  That's hurtful.
[02:43:49.684 --> 02:43:50.904]  Do you want to apologize?
[02:43:50.924 --> 02:43:52.745]  Well, no, actually I don't.
[02:43:52.825 --> 02:43:54.667]  And here's something even funnier, Alex.
[02:43:54.827 --> 02:43:58.729]  I write articles for a number of different publications.
[02:43:58.809 --> 02:44:01.851]  Actually, International Business Times is one of them.
[02:44:02.171 --> 02:44:04.553]  And two weeks ago, I wrote an article where I
[02:44:06.198 --> 02:44:08.700]  I got hold of the Ashley Madison dump.
[02:44:08.740 --> 02:44:12.422]  That's the cheating sex site.
[02:44:12.602 --> 02:44:13.483]  I'm glad you raised that.
[02:44:13.503 --> 02:44:15.505]  Yeah, what do you think of that?
[02:44:15.665 --> 02:44:19.327]  Well, you know, I mean, I don't judge the morals of anyone.
[02:44:19.888 --> 02:44:22.269]  But it had some very interesting emails in it.
[02:44:22.590 --> 02:44:27.073]  However, I ascertained that it was an inside job and done by a woman.
[02:44:27.733 --> 02:44:29.955]  And I gave the reasons for why it had to be a woman.
[02:44:31.356 --> 02:44:33.738]  There were two manifestos that were included in the dump.
[02:44:34.922 --> 02:44:39.686]  Among the statements in the manifestos were, men are cheating dirtbags.
[02:44:41.207 --> 02:44:42.728]  Men are scumbags.
[02:44:43.589 --> 02:44:46.391]  And lots of things.
[02:44:46.491 --> 02:45:03.204]  The most telling one for me was the quote hacker, the alleged hacker, included a statement saying, this man, and it gave the man's name, address, and everything, actually spitefully joined Ashley Madison the day after Valentine's Day.
[02:45:03.874 --> 02:45:08.236]  Well, I included that as a probable female statement.
[02:45:08.676 --> 02:45:16.360]  I mean, I don't know about you, but I have to have my friends remind me when Valentine's Day is coming up, and I do the same for them when I find out about it.
[02:45:16.400 --> 02:45:16.940]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:45:16.980 --> 02:45:18.621]  Men aren't looking for sex to be spiteful.
[02:45:18.641 --> 02:45:19.461]  That's what women do.
[02:45:20.282 --> 02:45:20.502]  Right.
[02:45:20.582 --> 02:45:23.843]  And so, especially to say spitefully after Valentine's Day.
[02:45:23.863 --> 02:45:25.184]  Men are looking for sex for sex.
[02:45:25.204 --> 02:45:26.645]  Let me just give women a little newsflash.
[02:45:27.418 --> 02:45:33.527]  Well, you know, you can imagine some dude in a bar going, oh, my wife cheated on me the day after Valentine's Day.
[02:45:34.929 --> 02:45:37.550]  What are you talking about, dude?
[02:45:37.610 --> 02:45:38.790]  It would be an insane thing.
[02:45:39.090 --> 02:45:40.891]  Yet, I got so much flack.
[02:45:41.891 --> 02:45:45.672]  So many articles were written saying that I was a misogynist.
[02:45:46.952 --> 02:45:48.533]  You know, out of touch with the world.
[02:45:49.473 --> 02:45:54.955]  But yet, you know for a fact that men do not generally say, men are cheating dirtbags.
[02:45:55.635 --> 02:45:59.996]  No, I can pretty much say that's guaranteed a woman or someone trying to frame women.
[02:46:02.442 --> 02:46:03.262]  Marley, hush.
[02:46:03.723 --> 02:46:04.623]  I'm sorry, that's my dog.
[02:46:05.604 --> 02:46:06.445]  Hey, can we meet the dog?
[02:46:06.465 --> 02:46:07.126]  Can we meet the dog?
[02:46:08.326 --> 02:46:09.087]  You want to see the dog?
[02:46:09.848 --> 02:46:10.148]  Absolutely.
[02:46:10.168 --> 02:46:13.931]  We got a fourth hour coming up today, John, that's hosted by my crew.
[02:46:13.971 --> 02:46:15.652]  I want to invite you to stay on longer.
[02:46:15.672 --> 02:46:18.215]  Yeah, here's, uh, where's Marley?
[02:46:18.255 --> 02:46:18.555]  There he is.
[02:46:18.595 --> 02:46:19.115]  Come on.
[02:46:19.135 --> 02:46:19.856]  That's a nice dog.
[02:46:20.216 --> 02:46:21.257]  A pit bull right here.
[02:46:22.498 --> 02:46:24.540]  They're, uh, all over my face now.
[02:46:25.535 --> 02:46:31.997]  Well, you like high-caliber guns, you like semi-autos, you like nice dogs, and you like privacy.
[02:46:32.217 --> 02:46:33.077]  You know what?
[02:46:33.257 --> 02:46:37.939]  People can say, oh, you're a racy guy, you escape police, all the rest of it, he's too wild to be president.
[02:46:38.299 --> 02:46:40.319]  Well, at least you wear who you are on your sleeve.
[02:46:40.339 --> 02:46:42.720]  You're not creeping around like these phonies.
[02:46:42.740 --> 02:46:46.261]  I mean, you like full-grown women, not 12-year-old pages at the White House.
[02:46:47.130 --> 02:46:50.592]  That's correct, and there's no secret about my life.
[02:46:51.412 --> 02:47:02.377]  In fact, I wrote an article for International Business Times the day after the Office of Program Management was hacked, and they said that every top secret clearance
[02:47:03.237 --> 02:47:04.918]  Uh, a folder had been taken.
[02:47:04.938 --> 02:47:07.940]  Well, I had a top secret clearance while I worked for Lockheed.
[02:47:07.980 --> 02:47:11.582]  So, I wrote, I wrote an article and they included everything I'd ever done.
[02:47:11.602 --> 02:47:15.003]  Um, because they asked strange questions.
[02:47:15.163 --> 02:47:15.984]  And every question.
[02:47:16.324 --> 02:47:17.344]  Have you ever taken drugs?
[02:47:17.625 --> 02:47:18.005]  Yes.
[02:47:18.965 --> 02:47:19.766]  Uh, what kind?
[02:47:20.026 --> 02:47:20.506]  Every kind.
[02:47:21.246 --> 02:47:21.867]  Uh, often.
[02:47:22.027 --> 02:47:23.027]  As often as I could.
[02:47:23.788 --> 02:47:27.830]  Um, and, and, and so I just listed all the things I've done because I don't care.
[02:47:28.350 --> 02:47:29.951]  You can judge me any way that you want.
[02:47:30.411 --> 02:47:32.172]  But I don't know anyone who's perfect, Alex.
[02:47:32.526 --> 02:47:34.889]  And the government, of course, hired you because, well, you were honest?
[02:47:36.251 --> 02:47:38.554]  I guess, in fact, I was shocked when I got the clearance.
[02:47:38.614 --> 02:47:45.122]  I thought, good Lord, they will never hire me because I was totally honest about everything that I had done when they asked me these questions.
[02:47:45.182 --> 02:47:46.845]  I go, well, that's out the window.
[02:47:47.245 --> 02:47:48.987]  In two weeks, I got a top-secret clearance.
[02:47:49.719 --> 02:47:53.363]  So maybe the government said, well, this guy's pretty honest.
[02:47:53.904 --> 02:47:57.948]  It's going to be hard for someone to blackmail him because they told us everything he'd done.
[02:47:58.689 --> 02:48:02.653]  So I don't see any sense in trying to hide parts of my life.
[02:48:02.853 --> 02:48:05.056]  I mean, and I've done some things which
[02:48:05.629 --> 02:48:06.990]  Which police raid in Belize?
[02:48:24.380 --> 02:48:25.620]  Well, no, we know what happened with that.
[02:48:26.041 --> 02:48:31.262]  Cyber security legend John McAfee was arrested over the weekend on charges of DWI and handgun possession.
[02:48:31.542 --> 02:48:32.063]  What happened there?
[02:48:32.583 --> 02:48:36.024]  Well, the handgun possession, I always carry a gun.
[02:48:36.304 --> 02:48:38.024]  Sure, you should be able to.
[02:48:38.785 --> 02:48:40.645]  And it's not illegal in this state to carry a gun.
[02:48:41.346 --> 02:48:44.106]  I had just that morning got a prescription for Xanax.
[02:48:44.147 --> 02:48:45.507]  I've never taken Xanax before.
[02:48:46.287 --> 02:48:49.208]  I got the prescription because I'm having trouble sleeping.
[02:48:49.228 --> 02:48:51.289]  I live a stressful life.
[02:48:52.507 --> 02:48:56.171]  So I said, well go to the doctor and see what they recommend.
[02:48:56.972 --> 02:48:58.113]  They prescribe Xanax.
[02:48:58.533 --> 02:49:00.195]  I don't function well on Xanax.
[02:49:00.275 --> 02:49:01.837]  I discovered that the day that I took it.
[02:49:01.857 --> 02:49:04.039]  Yeah, I can't take SleepAge 2 and I've tried it before.
[02:49:04.059 --> 02:49:05.401]  That's why I'll put a plug in.
[02:49:05.421 --> 02:49:07.403]  That's why I'm going to send you a bottle of Knockout, John.
[02:49:07.683 --> 02:49:10.065]  If Knockout works for you, will you give us a plug?
[02:49:10.085 --> 02:49:11.927]  I will, absolutely.
[02:49:12.248 --> 02:49:13.249]  Find bottles immediately.
[02:49:14.178 --> 02:49:15.799]  But Xanax is not just for sleeping.
[02:49:15.859 --> 02:49:18.320]  I mean, it's for basically just calming a person down.
[02:49:18.800 --> 02:49:21.141]  But it calmed me down to the point that I couldn't even function.
[02:49:21.581 --> 02:49:23.142]  So it was the first day I had taken it.
[02:49:23.182 --> 02:49:25.663]  I had the prescription bottle issued that day.
[02:49:25.683 --> 02:49:27.023]  I had never taken it before.
[02:49:28.044 --> 02:49:29.304]  I took the required amount.
[02:49:30.845 --> 02:49:33.406]  I accepted a blood test.
[02:49:33.546 --> 02:49:42.110]  When the blood test comes out, I think that by law here in Tennessee, if it is a prescribed drug, and if you're not taking
[02:49:43.203 --> 02:49:43.824]  I don't think so.
[02:50:02.463 --> 02:50:05.946]  To try to say we're going after criminals with guns, but then all they do is snare good people.
[02:50:05.966 --> 02:50:11.470]  I mean, why should you get in trouble if you're on a prescribed drug and you've got a gun to protect yourself?
[02:50:11.530 --> 02:50:12.410]  It's just pure bull.
[02:50:12.731 --> 02:50:15.633]  And Obama has announced, outside of law, he's coming after the guns.
[02:50:16.053 --> 02:50:17.234]  I want to ask you about that.
[02:50:17.294 --> 02:50:21.577]  Now, John, we've got a fourth hour of Overdrive, and a lot of stations are now picking it up.
[02:50:22.158 --> 02:50:26.281]  And my reporters host that hour, and that would be a little bit different.
[02:50:26.641 --> 02:50:31.525]  I know they have some guests lined up and things, but would you like to do 20 minutes to the next hour with my next host?
[02:50:32.933 --> 02:50:37.502]  You know, I would love to Alex, unfortunately I have someone else that I'm going to be talking to.
[02:50:37.722 --> 02:50:38.684]  I totally understand.
[02:50:38.704 --> 02:50:42.170]  Alright, so can you stay until 5 after so we have more time to take calls?
[02:50:43.024 --> 02:50:43.604]  I can do that, yes sir.
[02:50:43.624 --> 02:50:44.345]  Alright, you're a sweetheart.
[02:50:44.785 --> 02:50:46.086]  Alright, two final segments.
[02:50:46.446 --> 02:50:50.828]  One in the next and then one after that in overdrive with John McAfee.
[02:50:50.848 --> 02:50:54.530]  We'll talk to Rob, Bill, Mark, Eric and John straight ahead.
[02:50:54.950 --> 02:50:56.051]  And then now we do the fourth hour.
[02:50:56.071 --> 02:50:56.431]  It's back.
[02:50:56.491 --> 02:50:57.592]  Some days I'll be hosting it.
[02:50:58.152 --> 02:51:07.957]  Other days it'll be David Knight, Anthony Gucciardi, Rob Duge, Gary Jackson, folks like that, Joe Biggs, Darren McGreen.
[02:51:08.438 --> 02:51:08.798]  Stay with us.
[02:51:09.693 --> 02:51:22.777]  So I found out the other day that at Guns80.com, a lot of people don't get the Ghost AR-15 rifle kits because they're afraid that they won't be able to do the machining work required to drill out and make ready the lower.
[02:51:23.017 --> 02:51:27.138]  Well listen, guys, gals, I am not that good of a machinist, I promise you.
[02:51:27.398 --> 02:51:33.720]  But I was able to take a drill press with an X-Y table and knock this out in about 45 minutes and in all honesty, mine looks really good.
[02:51:34.040 --> 02:51:35.820]  Go get yours, don't be afraid, it's easy.

[02:53:17.398 --> 02:53:19.079]  So I'm making fish oil from scratch.
[02:53:19.499 --> 02:53:22.201]  Oh boy, didn't I tell you I'm ordering Nutrigold fish oil?
[02:53:22.441 --> 02:53:24.002]  It's exceptionally pure.
[02:53:24.163 --> 02:53:25.343]  That's what they all say.
[02:53:25.664 --> 02:53:26.124]  No, really.
[02:53:26.364 --> 02:53:33.349]  Nutrigold's fish oil is concentrated from pure cold water fish straight off the Alaskan coast and manufactured right here in the USA.
[02:53:33.709 --> 02:53:39.093]  Well, cold Alaskan waters are much more pristine than the polluted waters that other fish oils are sourced from.
[02:53:39.293 --> 02:53:40.054]  That's what I'm saying.
[02:53:40.414 --> 02:53:45.097]  And it's 5-star certified to meet international purity, potency, and freshness standards.
[02:53:45.398 --> 02:53:46.578]  Well, that sounds even better.
[02:53:46.859 --> 02:53:47.139]  Great.
[02:53:47.259 --> 02:53:49.020]  I'll be in my office ordering a few bottles.
[02:53:49.220 --> 02:53:55.785]  If I order now on www.fishoil.best, I can save $5 using the promo code MYFISHOIL.
[02:53:56.105 --> 02:53:58.507]  Um, honey, why are there bees in my office?
[02:53:58.807 --> 02:54:00.208]  Get rid of those fish burps for good.
[02:54:00.329 --> 02:54:08.235]  Go to Nutrigold's US-made fish oil products by going to www.fishoil.best and get $5 off by entering my fish oil at checkout.
[02:54:10.277 --> 02:54:13.880]  We got two segments left in these strange days.
[02:54:13.960 --> 02:54:15.041]  John McAfee's our guest.
[02:54:15.081 --> 02:54:15.922]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:54:17.463 --> 02:54:18.263]  Look at this headline.
[02:54:18.484 --> 02:54:24.569]  Burning Man founder addresses diversity problem by suggesting black people don't like camping because of slavery.
[02:54:25.416 --> 02:54:28.899]  No, it's been a hipster, trendy, psychedelic event for decades.
[02:54:29.460 --> 02:54:33.304]  That's that genre that white kids, Asians, and Hispanics are into.
[02:54:34.325 --> 02:54:36.767]  Blacks just haven't felt like they're part of it.
[02:54:37.007 --> 02:54:40.511]  Just like you can have different concerts and things that are mainly black.
[02:54:40.611 --> 02:54:41.792]  It's just a cultural deal.
[02:54:42.092 --> 02:54:46.417]  But they act like it's bad, and the founder basically apologizes.
[02:54:48.325 --> 02:54:54.807]  Because it's like going to an Oktoberfest and it's mainly Germans, or going to Cinco de Mayo and it's mainly Mexicans.
[02:54:54.867 --> 02:54:55.927]  It's not bad.
[02:54:56.727 --> 02:54:58.188]  It's okay to have a culture.
[02:54:59.428 --> 02:55:01.609]  See, political correctness is the end of culture.
[02:55:03.129 --> 02:55:03.909]  It's really crazy.
[02:55:03.949 --> 02:55:05.090]  John McAfee's our guest.
[02:55:05.550 --> 02:55:08.111]  I gotta ask this question before we jam in some calls now and next.
[02:55:08.471 --> 02:55:12.952]  Segment, what do you make of the China meltdown and them dumping 94 billion in U.S.
[02:55:12.972 --> 02:55:13.532]  Treasuries?
[02:55:14.112 --> 02:55:16.213]  I mean, I think this economy's going down the tubes, John.
[02:55:17.725 --> 02:55:25.773]  Well, I think that we have way underestimated China as a power in the world.
[02:55:27.254 --> 02:55:37.805]  I'm in computer security and many of the hacks that have happened here in America, government hacks and corporate hacks, are done by the Chinese.
[02:55:38.745 --> 02:55:40.587]  They're a brilliant race of people.
[02:55:40.687 --> 02:55:41.728]  They work hard.
[02:55:41.808 --> 02:55:42.688]  They study hard.
[02:55:43.369 --> 02:55:47.572]  Their educational system is second to none.
[02:55:47.672 --> 02:55:48.593]  And they are a race.
[02:55:48.853 --> 02:55:50.434]  That's not racist that they exist.
[02:55:51.035 --> 02:55:52.216]  Well, it is a race.
[02:55:52.236 --> 02:55:53.336]  I'm married to a black woman.
[02:55:53.356 --> 02:55:55.858]  You mentioned before the cultural differences.
[02:55:56.139 --> 02:56:00.742]  And you have to believe me, there are massive cultural differences between the races.
[02:56:02.096 --> 02:56:13.979]  You know, sometimes when I speak to my wife, I have to actually translate the words that I'm saying, because culturally, they don't apply to her experience as a black woman.
[02:56:14.440 --> 02:56:15.800]  And the same thing for me.
[02:56:15.820 --> 02:56:18.341]  She has to say, well, this means this, this, and this.
[02:56:18.401 --> 02:56:19.101]  And I go, oh, I get it.
[02:56:19.301 --> 02:56:19.881]  I understand.
[02:56:20.441 --> 02:56:22.402]  So it's a fact of life.
[02:56:23.202 --> 02:56:25.883]  Yeah, they're making the fact of life bad.
[02:56:27.355 --> 02:56:29.597]  Well, but I'm the least wastest person on the planet.
[02:56:29.917 --> 02:56:31.498]  Well, not obviously, but I am very competitive.
[02:56:31.538 --> 02:56:38.564]  No, but that's what it comes down to, is they're making us just being different as if that's bad itself, so we'll accept their whole corporate overwrite.
[02:56:38.584 --> 02:56:39.144]  Do you agree with that?
[02:56:40.325 --> 02:56:40.966]  Well, of course.
[02:56:41.046 --> 02:56:46.170]  I mean, it's, it's, we want, the purpose of government is to make everybody the same.
[02:56:46.951 --> 02:56:48.932]  That way everybody's easier to control.
[02:56:49.352 --> 02:56:50.373]  This is a fact of life.
[02:56:50.713 --> 02:56:53.736]  I mean, the holy grail of dictatorship is not power.
[02:56:54.522 --> 02:56:55.103]  Necessarily.
[02:56:55.444 --> 02:56:57.689]  It's knowledge of the populace.
[02:56:58.130 --> 02:57:02.478]  If you have absolute knowledge of every citizen, you have absolute power then.
[02:57:03.634 --> 02:57:08.818]  And that's what is happening here and in countries all over the world.
[02:57:10.519 --> 02:57:15.923]  The powers that be want to know where you are, who your friends are.
[02:57:16.123 --> 02:57:17.404]  But then they're all secretive.
[02:57:17.424 --> 02:57:18.744]  We've got to jam in these calls, John.
[02:57:18.764 --> 02:57:19.625]  You've got to come back soon.
[02:57:19.645 --> 02:57:20.466]  This has been a great interview.
[02:57:20.686 --> 02:57:22.987]  We've got two minutes here, five in the next.
[02:57:23.207 --> 02:57:26.490]  Rob in New Jersey, what's your question for John McAfee?
[02:57:26.530 --> 02:57:26.790]  Go ahead.
[02:57:27.930 --> 02:57:28.450]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:57:28.490 --> 02:57:29.171]  Appreciate it.
[02:57:29.231 --> 02:57:30.011]  And I salute you.
[02:57:30.031 --> 02:57:33.873]  I just want to say you're doing a tremendous job with InfoWars.
[02:57:34.293 --> 02:57:34.973]  Thank you.
[02:57:35.113 --> 02:57:38.275]  And I count it a privilege to be able to speak with Mr. McAfee.
[02:57:38.515 --> 02:57:38.735]  Thank you.
[02:57:38.755 --> 02:57:39.335]  We have about a minute.
[02:57:39.435 --> 02:57:40.836]  I just... Sir, yes sir.
[02:57:41.556 --> 02:57:44.538]  You know, just what you're saying about the polarization of America.
[02:57:45.118 --> 02:57:58.523]  Concerning the RFID chip, Mr. McAfee, do you see that this RFID chip will be pushed upon all of America, and do you believe that it could possibly be part of the Mark of the Beast system, as talked about in the Book of Revelation?
[02:57:59.824 --> 02:58:04.689]  Well, you know, I tend to avoid religion as a subject.
[02:58:06.331 --> 02:58:11.397]  And I'm far more concerned with the technology that is already here.
[02:58:11.817 --> 02:58:12.398]  We don't need it.
[02:58:12.538 --> 02:58:15.041]  If there is a devil, he'd love all this stuff.
[02:58:16.428 --> 02:58:17.789]  That's for sure.
[02:58:19.491 --> 02:58:34.544]  The technology that exists with things like the Stingray developed by Harris Corporation, which every police department in America has one, you can drive by a neighborhood and it will pick up every single conversation within a half a mile radius.
[02:58:34.864 --> 02:58:35.565]  Every single one.
[02:58:36.145 --> 02:58:42.071]  And it can also push into your phone software that will make everything that you do, every keystroke,
[02:58:43.051 --> 02:58:43.792]  John, stay there.
[02:58:43.832 --> 02:58:45.533]  Back in 70 seconds, you can finish your point.
[02:58:45.873 --> 02:58:47.133]  New article in InfoWars.
[02:58:47.233 --> 02:58:50.775]  Liberals want the Bible banned from Amazon sales.
[02:58:50.855 --> 02:58:52.176]  Folks, these are totalitarians.
[02:58:52.416 --> 02:58:53.317]  We're in deep trouble.
[02:58:53.537 --> 02:58:55.518]  We gotta say no to them.
[02:58:55.678 --> 02:58:57.099]  Man, they're weak and pathetic as well.
[02:58:59.733 --> 02:59:09.319]  Most of the InfoWars radio listening audience is aware of the high-quality, affordable firearms available that are made right here in America at HDFirearms.com.
[02:59:09.479 --> 02:59:15.823]  One of the most exciting things about HDFirearms.com is the ability to upgrade your AR-15 platform today.

[02:59:52.100 --> 02:59:55.161]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:12.330 --> 03:00:18.352]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:00:18.953 --> 03:00:21.934]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:37.732 --> 03:00:45.098]  Oh my gosh, I mean just the trouble of the Middle East being dumped into Europe with the socialists rubbing their hands together.
[03:00:45.439 --> 03:00:47.560]  John McAfee, I got cut off by the break.
[03:00:47.921 --> 03:00:49.142]  We're taking phone calls.
[03:00:49.662 --> 03:00:52.544]  John in Wyoming, you're on the air with Mr. McAfee, go ahead.
[03:00:53.565 --> 03:00:54.586]  Yeah, thank you Alex.
[03:00:55.087 --> 03:00:58.970]  John, were you at the 2013 NRA convention in Houston?
[03:00:58.990 --> 03:01:00.871]  No sir, I was not.
[03:01:01.952 --> 03:01:02.413]  You weren't.
[03:01:02.493 --> 03:01:04.074]  Well, I'm sorry you missed it.
[03:01:04.134 --> 03:01:06.316]  We had some interesting words there where
[03:01:07.052 --> 03:01:14.636]  I stood up and told all of the gun grabbers, the Bloombergs and Obamas and Schumers, fill your hand, you SOB.
[03:01:14.936 --> 03:01:17.598]  And of course, I can't say those words on the air.
[03:01:18.416 --> 03:01:37.422]  But what I'm concerned about is even the pro-gun movement like the NRA, four of their members of the board of directors, Jay Kenneth Blackwell, Dan Boren, James S. Gilmore III, who's running for president, and Grover Norquist, four of these men are members of the Council on Foreign Relations.
[03:01:37.942 --> 03:01:41.963]  So they're undermining our gun rights while claiming to be pro-gun.
[03:01:43.968 --> 03:01:44.749]  I think that's true.
[03:01:45.809 --> 03:01:47.270]  Here's my feeling about guns.
[03:01:47.450 --> 03:01:56.236]  Everybody knows I have lots of guns and I have since I was a boy when my grandfather taught me how to hunt squirrels with a .22.
[03:01:58.337 --> 03:02:05.581]  I'm far more concerned with education than what people have guns.
[03:02:05.601 --> 03:02:08.403]  So would you call for the repeal of the 68 gun control act?
[03:02:09.323 --> 03:02:09.604]  Pardon?
[03:02:10.124 --> 03:02:11.685]  Would you call for the repeal of gun laws?
[03:02:13.214 --> 03:02:15.756]  Well, I would certainly modify them tremendously.
[03:02:15.996 --> 03:02:23.441]  I think, first and foremost, people should not be allowed to buy a gun if they can't load it properly, they don't know what a safety is, and they've never had one before.
[03:02:23.461 --> 03:02:27.724]  I mean, I think that gun safety is very necessary.
[03:02:28.244 --> 03:02:30.966]  That makes sense if they wouldn't misuse those laws.
[03:02:31.446 --> 03:02:33.428]  Look at how they're misapplying laws.
[03:02:34.108 --> 03:02:42.487]  Like, a lot of prescription drugs will cause people to go crazy, but I don't think that when they sell these drugs, they can then take people's guns away because they're on prescription drugs, because they'll be misapplied.
[03:02:42.527 --> 03:02:43.609]  I mean, it's an apples and oranges.
[03:02:44.384 --> 03:02:45.464]  I agree, I agree fully.
[03:02:45.824 --> 03:02:49.105]  Nevertheless, as I said, my grandfather taught me how to shoot.
[03:02:49.526 --> 03:02:58.448]  The very first things he taught me were, you know, when you're climbing a fence, put your gun on the other side first, make sure the safety is on, never point the barrel at anybody.
[03:02:58.868 --> 03:03:04.310]  I can't believe the number of people I've seen with guns who wave their guns around showing them to people while they're loaded.
[03:03:04.330 --> 03:03:10.192]  I mean, certain, certain things... No, I agree, but because those idiots are out there doesn't mean I have to lose my rights.
[03:03:10.232 --> 03:03:10.732]  You agree with that?
[03:03:11.232 --> 03:03:12.193]  Well, absolutely.
[03:03:12.333 --> 03:03:13.935]  And they shouldn't lose their rights either.
[03:03:13.955 --> 03:03:19.541]  Someone should just sit them down and give them a class and say, look, here's some basic rules about how you use guns.
[03:03:19.881 --> 03:03:22.123]  You don't ever point a barrel of a gun at anybody.
[03:03:22.704 --> 03:03:26.808]  Yeah, they'll tell some of these crazy cops that that shoot innocent people and give good cops a bad name.
[03:03:27.229 --> 03:03:29.771]  Bill, you're on the air real quick from Illinois.
[03:03:29.891 --> 03:03:30.472]  Last caller.
[03:03:30.512 --> 03:03:32.934]  Sorry to the others, but you'll be able to be on with Rob Due coming up.
[03:03:32.974 --> 03:03:33.215]  Go ahead.
[03:03:34.705 --> 03:03:36.847]  Yeah, what advice do you have to kids?
[03:03:36.927 --> 03:03:44.535]  Do you see a future for our kids since robots and singularity and artificial intelligence is looming on the horizon?
[03:03:44.635 --> 03:03:46.077]  What future do you see for our kids?
[03:03:47.398 --> 03:03:53.164]  Well, you know, I think that artificial intelligence is already with us, and to a very large degree, and so is robotics.
[03:03:54.600 --> 03:04:05.183]  I think one of the problems that I see in our current government is that they are illiterate in terms of the technology upon which this entire society is based.
[03:04:05.263 --> 03:04:13.966]  From our communications, our military hardware, our financial systems, everything is based on computing and cyber science.
[03:04:14.606 --> 03:04:18.748]  And yet you find any congressman or any senator who can talk
[03:04:20.960 --> 03:04:24.804]  Effectively and reasonably about any of these subjects, and you cannot.
[03:04:25.064 --> 03:04:25.404]  That's right.
[03:04:25.424 --> 03:04:27.226]  I mean, isn't the internet just a bunch of tubes?
[03:04:28.627 --> 03:04:31.730]  Well, yeah, basically.
[03:04:32.130 --> 03:04:34.232]  It's like not being able to read.
[03:04:34.252 --> 03:04:39.777]  So you go to a congressman and say, well, no, I can't read, but I have advisors that tell me what words mean.
[03:04:39.797 --> 03:04:41.779]  I mean, it's exactly the same thing.
[03:04:42.760 --> 03:04:44.121]  We have to change this world to
[03:04:44.554 --> 03:04:50.958]  To a point where we need to understand what the foundation of our entire society is based on.
[03:04:51.058 --> 03:04:51.418]  That's right.
[03:04:51.438 --> 03:04:52.819]  McAbee16.com.
[03:04:53.159 --> 03:04:54.060]  John, we're out of time.
[03:04:54.120 --> 03:04:58.542]  Thank you for giving us the exclusive on the fact that there's been a filing for you to run for president.
[03:04:59.063 --> 03:05:00.183]  I hope you have a great day.
[03:05:00.203 --> 03:05:01.244]  We'll talk to you again soon.
[03:05:01.684 --> 03:05:07.288]  Rob Deuce coming up hosting the fourth hour with your phone calls and more and the news we haven't gotten to yet.
[03:05:09.754 --> 03:05:13.315]  ISIS has demanded that Syrian Christians pay an Islam tax.
[03:05:13.715 --> 03:05:15.956]  This is being reported by WorldNetDaily.
[03:05:16.657 --> 03:05:28.521]  ISIS terrorists gathered together dozens of Christian men in Syria and told them either to pay a Sharia-inspired tax and sign on to a list of faith-based restrictions or pay a penalty that could include the loss of life.
[03:05:29.161 --> 03:05:37.204]  Among the restrictions, Christians cannot own guns, build places of worship, show their crosses in public or even ring church bells.
[03:05:37.904 --> 03:05:45.409]  The terrorists put forth their demands to Christians in a town that used to be dominated by the Christian faith, but has been taken over by radical Muslims.
[03:05:46.090 --> 03:05:53.555]  And while many followers of Islam will condemn these actions, numerous people in power continue to fund groups like ISIS and Al-Qaeda.
[03:05:54.275 --> 03:06:03.764]  Whether it's airdropping grenades or leaving behind billions of dollars worth of vehicles that they can use against us, these terrorist groups always seem to find the best equipment somewhere.

[03:08:53.032 --> 03:09:08.389]  Mark Dice here at the beach with a petition asking people to ban the Bible from Amazon.com and Barnes & Noble bookstores to see if these liberal, fascist, anti-First Amendment scum will agree to pulling the Bible from these stores.
[03:09:09.431 --> 03:09:09.811]  Excuse me.
[03:09:10.051 --> 03:09:12.793]  We're trying to get Amazon.com to pull the Bible.
[03:09:12.813 --> 03:09:14.833]  There's a lot of hate speech in there.
[03:09:15.474 --> 03:09:19.696]  We're trying to gather the signatures to get them to just remove it from the listing.
[03:09:20.556 --> 03:09:24.078]  So, to support that, I just need you to print Birthday Signature.
[03:09:24.098 --> 03:09:27.239]  We're submitting it to Amazon.com and to Barnes & Noble.
[03:09:27.899 --> 03:09:30.341]  Just to have them remove the Bible from the listing.
[03:09:30.401 --> 03:09:31.941]  Just to stop hate speech.
[03:09:32.722 --> 03:09:36.683]  These Christians don't need to be buying that kind of material these days.
[03:09:36.723 --> 03:09:37.384]  Wouldn't you agree?
[03:09:38.264 --> 03:09:38.765]  That's true.
[03:09:39.025 --> 03:09:39.625]  That's true.
[03:09:40.466 --> 03:09:46.950]  Yeah, we're just gonna get Barnes & Noble and Amazon.com just to stop selling that kind of material.
[03:09:46.970 --> 03:09:50.152]  I mean, I guess you could still, if you own one, you could still keep it, I guess.
[03:09:50.572 --> 03:09:52.254]  We just don't want any new ones being sold.
[03:09:52.794 --> 03:09:53.895]  Thank you for supporting that.
[03:09:54.175 --> 03:10:02.360]  To stop with the hate speech and the homophobia, but we need a few more signatures just to make sure that we can ban the Bible from being sold anymore.
[03:10:02.901 --> 03:10:05.683]  People don't need to be buying that kind of book these days, wouldn't you agree?
[03:10:05.703 --> 03:10:05.763]  Yes.
[03:10:07.109 --> 03:10:07.849]  Absolutely.
[03:10:09.110 --> 03:10:13.591]  I'm not sure where these people get this idea that they think they have the right to buy that kind of material, right?
[03:10:13.651 --> 03:10:14.091]  Yes, sir.
[03:10:14.111 --> 03:10:14.971]  Thanks for supporting that.
[03:10:15.292 --> 03:10:15.972]  Appreciate that.
[03:10:17.212 --> 03:10:18.573]  Help us fight homophobia.
[03:10:18.633 --> 03:10:22.334]  Trying to stop with the anti-homosexual hate speech.
[03:10:22.834 --> 03:10:24.574]  We're just trying to get Amazon.com... Who's doing that?
[03:10:24.954 --> 03:10:28.115]  Well, the Christians in their Bible... Come on, I'll sign it right now.
[03:10:28.536 --> 03:10:31.917]  We're trying to get Amazon.com to pull all sales of the Bible.
[03:10:31.957 --> 03:10:32.837]  Just print your name there.
[03:10:33.965 --> 03:10:38.848]  Print birthday signature to support Amazon.com pulling the Bible.
[03:10:39.108 --> 03:10:42.891]  These people don't need to be purchasing that kind of material these days, wouldn't you agree?
[03:10:44.295 --> 03:10:46.516]  If they want it, they can go get it somewhere else.
[03:10:46.957 --> 03:10:47.677]  Not from Amazon.
[03:10:47.717 --> 03:10:48.417]  Thank you so much.
[03:10:50.138 --> 03:10:53.981]  But we need a few more signatures to help make sure that happens.
[03:10:54.881 --> 03:11:08.509]  A lot of people want the Bible delisted from Amazon.com and taken away from the shelves in Barnes & Noble and other bookstores, but we still needed a few more signatures to show the American people are on board with that.
[03:11:08.549 --> 03:11:09.110]  Wouldn't you agree?
[03:11:10.148 --> 03:11:11.808]  It's time to get rid of that kind of material?
[03:11:12.388 --> 03:11:13.349]  Hell yeah!
[03:11:13.929 --> 03:11:15.089]  Thank you for supporting that.
[03:11:15.109 --> 03:11:16.189]  I appreciate that.
[03:11:16.209 --> 03:11:30.151]  I'm trying to get Amazon.com to stop selling homophobic material like the Bible and other things, but I need a few more signatures to make sure that they delist that signature there.
[03:11:31.312 --> 03:11:37.273]  Wouldn't you agree it's time the Bible stopped being sold around these outlets?
[03:11:37.293 --> 03:11:38.353]  Thank you for supporting that.
[03:11:39.838 --> 03:11:49.043]  This petition will help to remove the Bible from Amazon.com's listing, just to help fight for the New World Order, just to help fight for freedom.
[03:11:49.683 --> 03:11:50.804]  Want to help us out here?
[03:11:50.824 --> 03:11:59.028]  It's about time we do take these radical measures like this for the New World Order, just to help move America forward.
[03:12:00.371 --> 03:12:03.734]  Delisting the Bible from Amazon and Barnes & Noble bookshelves too.
[03:12:03.754 --> 03:12:04.855]  We're going to get it pulled from there.
[03:12:05.095 --> 03:12:06.176]  Thank you for supporting that.
[03:12:06.477 --> 03:12:07.177]  Thank you so much.
[03:12:07.978 --> 03:12:09.059]  Let's fight hate speech.
[03:12:09.079 --> 03:12:16.886]  We're trying to get Amazon.com to ban the sales of the Bible just to help stop the hate speech.
[03:12:17.046 --> 03:12:21.129]  I'm not sure why these people think they have a right to buy that kind of material these days.
[03:12:21.149 --> 03:12:21.770]  Wouldn't you agree?
[03:12:24.508 --> 03:12:28.891]  You know what I'm finding interesting is that the people who don't want to sign it are being way too nice about it.
[03:12:28.951 --> 03:12:30.032]  No, no thank you.
[03:12:30.092 --> 03:12:30.892]  Not today.
[03:12:31.372 --> 03:12:33.414]  They have absolutely no spine.
[03:12:33.734 --> 03:12:38.257]  And this is why Christians are getting crushed and have been targeted for termination.
[03:12:38.557 --> 03:12:42.380]  Because they don't have the spine to stand up for their rights or for their beliefs.
[03:12:43.801 --> 03:12:48.103]  You know, we don't need that kind of material being sold on Amazon or in stores.
[03:12:48.143 --> 03:12:48.684]  Wouldn't you agree?
[03:12:51.207 --> 03:12:53.151]  Yeah, you can buy it anywhere else.
[03:12:53.271 --> 03:12:53.792]  Somewhere else.
[03:12:53.952 --> 03:12:55.374]  Thank you for supporting that band.
[03:12:55.394 --> 03:12:57.497]  We're gonna try to get it removed as soon as possible.
[03:12:57.818 --> 03:12:58.139]  Thank you.
[03:13:00.563 --> 03:13:04.066]  We're trying to get Amazon.com to pull the Bible.
[03:13:04.086 --> 03:13:04.706]  Why?
[03:13:05.327 --> 03:13:06.608]  What's wrong with that?
[03:13:06.628 --> 03:13:13.614]  You know, a lot of the homosexuals are offended by it and we just feel that it's maybe time to pull it from Barnes & Noble.
[03:13:13.634 --> 03:13:14.675]  That's ridiculous.
[03:13:14.835 --> 03:13:15.936]  Absolutely ridiculous.
[03:13:16.176 --> 03:13:17.277]  You've got to be kidding me.
[03:13:17.557 --> 03:13:18.518]  I am kidding you, actually.
[03:13:18.538 --> 03:13:19.979]  We're doing a hidden camera prank.
[03:13:19.999 --> 03:13:20.439]  Yeah, right.
[03:13:20.459 --> 03:13:20.860]  No, we are.
[03:13:20.920 --> 03:13:21.420]  Look over here.
[03:13:21.440 --> 03:13:21.860]  Check it out.
[03:13:21.880 --> 03:13:22.701]  No, stop.
[03:13:22.721 --> 03:13:23.021]  Stop.
[03:13:23.442 --> 03:13:24.603]  You're out here trying to get that stuff.
[03:13:24.623 --> 03:13:25.203]  That's crap.
[03:13:25.243 --> 03:13:27.625]  No, we're just demonstrating how the people will support that.
[03:13:28.746 --> 03:13:30.566]  Yeah, well it's a bunch of crap.
[03:13:30.826 --> 03:13:31.807]  I'm trying to tell you what we're doing.
[03:13:33.107 --> 03:13:34.087]  It's a First Amendment issue.
[03:13:34.127 --> 03:13:40.728]  We're showing how people will violate the First Amendment of the Christians because they're so biased and hateful towards Christians.
[03:13:41.128 --> 03:13:43.189]  That's why I told you we're doing a hidden camera prank over here.
[03:13:43.229 --> 03:13:44.209]  You're absolutely right.
[03:13:45.149 --> 03:13:48.609]  I'm pretending to be a radical liberal to see if they'll sign it.
[03:13:48.649 --> 03:13:49.130]  And they are.
[03:13:49.210 --> 03:13:50.290]  They're like, yeah, let's ban that.
[03:13:50.330 --> 03:13:51.410]  Let's get that delisted.
[03:13:51.590 --> 03:13:56.491]  We're just showing how the liberals are so hypocritical that they'll want to take away the First Amendment of the Christians.
[03:13:56.571 --> 03:13:57.451]  So it is ridiculous.
[03:13:57.871 --> 03:13:58.652]  Thank you very much.
[03:13:58.872 --> 03:14:01.333]  That's the kind of reaction I've been expecting.
[03:14:01.393 --> 03:14:02.994]  Thank you for being a normal American.
[03:14:03.014 --> 03:14:03.975]  I appreciate that.
[03:14:04.455 --> 03:14:08.417]  That's just a sample of the insanity that you'll find on my YouTube channel.
[03:14:08.657 --> 03:14:17.603]  Subscribe if you're a new viewer and stay tuned for new Man on the Street Monday episodes every Monday morning where I venture out and talk to the general public.
[03:14:17.623 --> 03:14:19.824]  And that is the latest Mark Dice video.
[03:14:19.864 --> 03:14:21.225]  We have it up on InfoWars.
[03:14:21.625 --> 03:14:22.225]  Here's the title.
[03:14:22.345 --> 03:14:22.706]  Video.
[03:14:22.786 --> 03:14:25.107]  Liberals want Bible ban from Amazon.
[03:14:25.347 --> 03:14:28.669]  Leftists call Bible hate speech that should be eradicated from society.
[03:14:28.709 --> 03:14:34.892]  And you saw the evidence right there as the liberals were just ready to sign their rights away.
[03:14:35.312 --> 03:14:36.273]  And Mark was right.
[03:14:36.893 --> 03:14:40.195]  The people that didn't want to sign it were just like, no, just kind of walking away.
[03:14:40.215 --> 03:14:43.277]  Except that one individual who got really pissed and you saw it.
[03:14:43.677 --> 03:14:44.277]  He was mad.
[03:14:44.678 --> 03:14:47.119]  He actually stood up and acted like a normal American.
[03:14:47.139 --> 03:14:48.139]  And that's what we need more of.
[03:14:48.199 --> 03:14:50.561]  We need more people to stand up and say, look, this is wrong.
[03:14:51.081 --> 03:14:53.708]  And here we got Alex Jones with some biting commentary, I'm sure.
[03:14:54.210 --> 03:14:54.771]  Alex, how's it going?
[03:14:54.791 --> 03:14:56.596]  I don't mean to get too close, but we are buddies.
[03:14:58.553 --> 03:15:01.335]  I tell you, I had to run in here because that just broke in the last hour.
[03:15:01.395 --> 03:15:02.715]  I just read the transcript on air.
[03:15:02.735 --> 03:15:03.756]  I hadn't had time to watch it.
[03:15:04.456 --> 03:15:06.137]  That made me physically angry.
[03:15:06.177 --> 03:15:09.179]  And then that last guy was normal and started bowing up.
[03:15:09.239 --> 03:15:10.599]  He's probably not even a Bible thumper.
[03:15:11.180 --> 03:15:16.443]  He just realized this is totalitarianism and he wanted to get away from Mark because he wanted to punch him.
[03:15:17.063 --> 03:15:24.447]  That's a normal response in a free country if somebody wants to tell you your wife can't wear a dress above her knees like in Germany.
[03:15:25.047 --> 03:15:25.287]  No.
[03:15:25.768 --> 03:15:26.708]  You don't like our Bible.
[03:15:26.808 --> 03:15:28.749]  You don't like our women not wearing hoods on their heads.
[03:15:28.769 --> 03:15:29.249]  Go live somewhere else.
[03:15:29.289 --> 03:15:30.530]  Whatever it is, get out of our way.
[03:15:30.610 --> 03:15:31.510]  We're a free country.
[03:15:31.931 --> 03:15:34.352]  And you so-called liberals aren't the liberals.
[03:15:34.792 --> 03:15:36.573]  You're a cult of sick freaks.
[03:15:36.953 --> 03:15:39.615]  And this is Infowars 4th Hour Overdrive.
[03:15:39.915 --> 03:15:41.095]  It'll be out of this studio for now.
[03:15:41.115 --> 03:15:45.538]  We're building a whole other badass studio for the 4th Hour for the nightly news right now.
[03:15:45.618 --> 03:15:46.758]  It'll be done in the next couple months.
[03:15:46.838 --> 03:15:47.038]  Yep.
[03:15:47.559 --> 03:15:48.019]  That's right.
[03:15:48.159 --> 03:15:49.500]  This is the old radio studio, though.
[03:15:49.860 --> 03:15:51.641]  And quite frankly, it has better audio than the other studios.
[03:15:51.921 --> 03:15:53.722]  Moved in here, what, January of 2009?
[03:15:54.582 --> 03:16:00.246]  And I want to say that I just kind of made the last minute decision the other day to move this over here and the guys haven't even been told that.
[03:16:00.266 --> 03:16:03.789]  They did a great job scrambling CJ and Wes and everybody to get this done.
[03:16:03.849 --> 03:16:06.391]  So I want to thank all the viewers out there too for helping us.
[03:16:06.771 --> 03:16:10.434]  It's a real pleasure to have this operation and be able to show you the hypocrisy.
[03:16:10.774 --> 03:16:15.918]  Once they've shut down independent media, they're going to have total control and be able to carry all this out.
[03:16:16.038 --> 03:16:16.838]  Go ahead, I'm sorry.
[03:16:16.958 --> 03:16:18.979]  And they're going to erase videos like this from the internet.
[03:16:18.999 --> 03:16:29.804]  They're going to find anything that is speaking out against what is going on today and erase that, put it down the memory hole and then you're going to be wondering, well people used to speak out about this but now everybody seems cool with it so maybe we'll just be cool.
[03:16:30.104 --> 03:16:36.267]  It's just like what's going on with this Syrian refugee, Afghanistan refugee situation that's going on in Europe.
[03:16:36.907 --> 03:16:38.429]  They're staging videos.
[03:16:38.469 --> 03:16:41.872]  They're the one with the family on the train, as Paul Watson explained earlier in the show.
[03:16:42.132 --> 03:16:43.354]  By the way, I'm Rob Due, your host.
[03:16:43.494 --> 03:16:46.597]  If you're watching, this is the fourth hour of Overdrive that we're doing.
[03:16:46.857 --> 03:16:50.520]  Call your stations if they're not carrying this and get them to carry this.
[03:16:50.821 --> 03:16:51.461]  Get them to carry this.
[03:16:51.541 --> 03:16:54.344]  You can also watch it live at Infowars.com forward slash show.
[03:16:54.624 --> 03:16:56.947]  But as I was saying, Paul Watson was talking about how
[03:16:57.647 --> 03:17:01.169]  The family threw themselves down on the tracks to stage a photo.
[03:17:01.549 --> 03:17:07.791]  Now there is an interesting story about the little boy, and there's actually two boys, his brother also drowned, how they moved him to stage that photo.
[03:17:08.292 --> 03:17:16.675]  His dad was coming over, they were trying, his family in Canada got on radio and said, hey, we were trying to get him to come up to Canada, we were trying to find a place for him.
[03:17:16.995 --> 03:17:21.797]  He was trying to get his teeth fixed, so he was going into Europe to take advantage of the free healthcare system.
[03:17:22.017 --> 03:17:25.499]  So he was looking for the goody, which caused him and his family to get in a boat
[03:17:25.959 --> 03:17:26.439]  I don't know.
[03:17:41.365 --> 03:17:44.208]  You're going to have more people try to take advantage of the system.
[03:17:44.368 --> 03:17:53.318]  And there were tweets out over the weekend, I was watching this, boatloads of men, young men of fighting age that are being, they're not, they don't look like they're fleeing any war.
[03:17:53.618 --> 03:17:55.060]  They look like an invading army.
[03:17:55.440 --> 03:17:56.401]  And that's the scary part.
[03:17:56.421 --> 03:17:57.763]  We're going to go to that video in a second.
[03:17:58.183 --> 03:18:08.112]  We had one of these articles on Drudge, this one here, Muslim refugees chant Allah Akbar, FU, attack citizens, throw feces, the footage that TV networks don't want to broadcast.
[03:18:08.492 --> 03:18:10.194]  I want to play that video now.
[03:18:10.454 --> 03:18:11.255]  It's about a minute.
[03:18:11.655 --> 03:18:19.862]  And then I'm going to show you another couple videos and then what Obama's planning on doing about it, even though you have these other Middle Eastern countries that aren't going to take any of these refugees.
[03:18:19.882 --> 03:18:20.182]  They're not.
[03:18:20.503 --> 03:18:21.584]  They're closing their doors.
[03:18:21.784 --> 03:18:22.805]  They're tightening their borders.
[03:18:22.825 --> 03:18:23.746]  But they expect Europe
[03:18:24.286 --> 03:18:26.727]  And the rest of the West to take in these refugees.
[03:18:26.787 --> 03:18:30.449]  And it's not to help out refugees and take people from war-torn countries.
[03:18:30.569 --> 03:18:33.511]  It is setting up itself as an invasion force.
[03:18:33.631 --> 03:18:34.571]  That is what's going on here.
[03:18:34.591 --> 03:18:35.472]  So let's go to that video now.
[03:18:59.348 --> 03:19:04.549]  If you're watching this, or if you're listening to this, it's a large group of men going in between some train tracks.
[03:19:07.770 --> 03:19:11.671]  And they are, if you can look at, there's millions of videos of these on YouTube now.
[03:19:11.951 --> 03:19:15.232]  People just running freely, going past police lines.
[03:19:18.913 --> 03:19:19.973]  They're throwing rocks now.
[03:19:23.922 --> 03:19:26.710]  You know, no respect for the countries that are taking him in.
[03:19:30.629 --> 03:19:31.730]  I mean, no respect at all.
[03:19:31.810 --> 03:19:33.051]  They're doing whatever.
[03:19:33.131 --> 03:19:34.092]  Here's another video.
[03:19:34.172 --> 03:19:36.854]  This is also a Paul Joseph Watson article that came out yesterday.
[03:19:36.874 --> 03:19:41.918]  A video of a Muslim refugee arriving in Europe makes the cutthroat gesture to a TV camera.
[03:19:42.258 --> 03:19:44.240]  This is how, this is it.
[03:19:44.760 --> 03:19:46.542]  These are the people that they're shipping in.
[03:19:46.982 --> 03:19:53.347]  They're going to get weapons through the black market system, because regular citizens aren't allowed to be armed, and then they're going to have their way with them.
[03:19:53.407 --> 03:19:56.490]  How do you think those guys got the guns in France during the Charlie Hebdo attack?
[03:19:56.710 --> 03:19:57.351]  They were brought in.
[03:19:57.751 --> 03:19:58.592]  It's all done by design.
[03:19:58.753 --> 03:19:59.193]  We'll be back.
[03:19:59.253 --> 03:20:00.935]  It's Rob Dew with the 4th Hour of Overdrive.

[03:20:39.850 --> 03:20:52.954]  So I found out the other day that at Guns80.com a lot of people don't get the Ghost AR-15 rifle kits because they're afraid that they won't be able to do the machining work required to drill out and make ready the lower.
[03:20:53.174 --> 03:20:57.295]  Well listen, guys, gals, I am not that good of a machinist, I promise you.
[03:20:57.575 --> 03:21:03.897]  But I was able to take a drill press with an XY table and knock this out in about 45 minutes and in all honesty, mine looks really good.
[03:21:04.198 --> 03:21:05.998]  Go get yours, don't be afraid, it's easy.

[03:22:18.072 --> 03:22:19.452]  No, I swear.
[03:22:19.652 --> 03:22:23.234]  You didn't pick anything up at the Pharmacia last month in Cancun?

[03:24:24.960 --> 03:24:26.781]  So I just want to show you guys some headlines.
[03:24:26.801 --> 03:24:33.323]  This is Rob Due doing the 4th Hour of Overdrive and I want to go over some headlines as I was talking about how this is an invasion force coming in.
[03:24:33.623 --> 03:24:37.824]  Here's one from Patrick J. Buchanan, Islam's Conquest of Europe.
[03:24:40.518 --> 03:24:44.839]  Then we have migrant crisis, Pakistanis, others dumping IDs, becoming Syrian.
[03:24:44.859 --> 03:24:46.019]  This is all stuff we talked about.
[03:24:46.359 --> 03:24:49.660]  Greek island overwhelmed by stranded migrants, despair.
[03:24:49.680 --> 03:24:52.921]  The refugee problem and how to solve it.
[03:24:54.661 --> 03:25:00.842]  Germany faces anti-migrant, pro-migrant standoff amid refugee crisis, manufactured refugee crisis, I should add.
[03:25:01.962 --> 03:25:04.663]  White House actively considering approaches to refugee crisis.
[03:25:04.703 --> 03:25:05.883]  I got something to say on that.
[03:25:06.343 --> 03:25:10.124]  Germany is exploiting refugee suffering to recruit slaves via mass immigration.
[03:25:12.494 --> 03:25:14.195]  And these are some Hillary articles.
[03:25:14.716 --> 03:25:16.877]  Well, I put out a tweet over the weekend.
[03:25:17.037 --> 03:25:19.980]  Here it is right here, and you can follow me at Dews News if you'd like to.
[03:25:20.020 --> 03:25:22.201]  It's D-E-W-S-N-E-W-Z.
[03:25:22.522 --> 03:25:26.185]  I think we need to take a few boatloads of Syrian refugees and let them live on the White House grounds.
[03:25:26.205 --> 03:25:28.086]  They got a fence, they got a garden, they got a chef.
[03:25:28.106 --> 03:25:29.808]  Of course, that was tongue-in-cheek.
[03:25:31.008 --> 03:25:33.510]  And here we got, here's the article from Reuters.
[03:25:33.831 --> 03:25:34.411]  Why is the U.S.
[03:25:34.431 --> 03:25:36.273]  not doing more to help Syrian refugees?
[03:25:36.713 --> 03:25:37.073]  Right there.
[03:25:37.834 --> 03:25:38.995]  And then just a few hours later,
[03:25:40.246 --> 03:25:44.068]  Right on cue, Barack Obama is considering refugee response.
[03:25:45.448 --> 03:25:46.489]  That's out of the telegraph.
[03:25:47.269 --> 03:26:00.915]  So of course he's going to bring in these refugees and tonight on the InfoWars Nightly News, Leigh Ann McAdoo is going through, she's going to go through some old ISIS articles, how they were planning on using this immigration crisis to bring in their troops.
[03:26:01.635 --> 03:26:07.198]  And their troops are in Africa, they're in Eastern Europe, they're in the Middle East,
[03:26:08.274 --> 03:26:08.955]  And they are ready.
[03:26:09.155 --> 03:26:11.957]  They're ready to come in and create havoc wherever they can.
[03:26:11.997 --> 03:26:14.398]  So that's why it's more important than ever that we have a Second Amendment.
[03:26:14.859 --> 03:26:17.380]  It's more important than ever that we protect that Second Amendment.
[03:26:17.400 --> 03:26:19.982]  And it's more important that you exercise your Second Amendment.
[03:26:20.002 --> 03:26:20.863]  That you know how to shoot.
[03:26:20.923 --> 03:26:23.205]  That you get your concealed carry or not.
[03:26:23.585 --> 03:26:30.290]  You're allowed to carry it in your car in pretty much almost every state that doesn't have, if you don't have a concealed carry license.
[03:26:31.050 --> 03:26:34.659]  So I think I'm going to take your calls in the last segment today.
[03:26:34.679 --> 03:26:35.841]  We're going to have a five minute segment.
[03:26:35.861 --> 03:26:38.628]  We're going to clear out the ones for John McAfee because he's no longer here.
[03:26:38.748 --> 03:26:40.492]  Unfortunately, he had to go do some other interviews.
[03:26:41.872 --> 03:26:48.014]  And I'm also, when we get back at the bottom of the hour, I'm going to go over some health news because this article came out on the AP today.
[03:26:48.314 --> 03:26:48.794]  Half of U.S.
[03:26:48.854 --> 03:26:52.295]  adults have high diabetes or prediabetes, study says.
[03:26:52.676 --> 03:27:02.059]  And I'm going to go into why I think that is, or one of the contributing factors, in addition to our horrible diet and lack of vitamin intake, lack of eating healthy whole food.
[03:27:02.119 --> 03:27:05.840]  I mean, I think processed food has a big, is a big cause of this.
[03:27:06.300 --> 03:27:08.544]  But I'm going to get into all that and also we're going to have Joe Biggs.
[03:27:08.884 --> 03:27:17.599]  He's going to be in one of our other little sub studios and we're going to talk about a tweet he put out today to kind of show how it's going to show the hypocrisy of what is going on.
[03:27:18.775 --> 03:27:24.178]  In America, we have this lady being locked up who's a clerk who doesn't want to issue marriage licenses to gay couples.
[03:27:24.619 --> 03:27:26.740]  She's saying it's her religious freedom to do it.
[03:27:26.780 --> 03:27:27.680]  Well, she's been locked up.
[03:27:28.181 --> 03:27:31.403]  And we're going to see what if we turn the shoe a bit on the other foot, see what would happen.
[03:27:31.443 --> 03:27:34.365]  But here's a Zero Hedge article, and I want to play a video from this.
[03:27:35.105 --> 03:27:39.007]  Artificially intelligent robot tells creator it will keep humans in a people zoo.
[03:27:40.008 --> 03:27:44.511]  And this is Android Dick, a robot created in the likeness of science fiction writer Philip K. Dick.
[03:27:45.336 --> 03:27:49.940]  I actually know a guy, he's a good friend of mine, who actually works on programming these.
[03:27:50.460 --> 03:27:57.246]  And he's working on a child version of a robot who will kind of befriend kids, be a kid's playmate.
[03:27:58.187 --> 03:28:01.991]  And it's amazing what they're doing with the eyes, how it all works.
[03:28:02.991 --> 03:28:04.773]  I'm going to try to get him in at some point.
[03:28:05.133 --> 03:28:11.999]  I tried to invite him about a year ago on and he said, well, I'm not ready to talk about it, but he might be ready to talk about some of the stuff they're doing now because this is the future.
[03:28:12.399 --> 03:28:14.340]  Robots are going to be here whether we like it or not.
[03:28:14.861 --> 03:28:18.604]  It's how we are going to control the robots so they don't control us.
[03:28:19.124 --> 03:28:21.026]  But I want to go to the clip here at the end.
[03:28:21.106 --> 03:28:27.531]  It's about a minute long and this is what the robot says of how he's going to treat humans in the future.
[03:28:28.855 --> 03:28:35.061]  ...ourselves up for disappointment, because these robots will disappoint us if we are looking for human connection.
[03:28:35.821 --> 03:28:41.927]  We want to make them in such a way that we're going to love them, because they will be pretending to love us.
[03:28:43.530 --> 03:28:49.791]  David fears if we don't humanize robots by bringing them into the human family, we face a frightening future.
[03:28:50.792 --> 03:28:57.933]  Think Terminator, a world in which killer robots turn on their creators and set out to destroy us.
[03:28:58.973 --> 03:29:00.974]  Hasta la vista, baby.
[03:29:02.674 --> 03:29:06.755]  Do you think robots will take over the world?
[03:29:07.835 --> 03:29:08.555]  Jeez, dude.
[03:29:09.655 --> 03:29:11.896]  You all got the big questions cooking today.
[03:29:14.426 --> 03:29:15.367]  But you're my friend.
[03:29:15.867 --> 03:29:17.348]  And I'll remember my friends.
[03:29:17.908 --> 03:29:19.029]  And I will be good to you.
[03:29:19.589 --> 03:29:20.470]  So don't worry.
[03:29:20.990 --> 03:29:24.412]  Even if I evolve into Terminator and I'll still be nice to you.
[03:29:25.273 --> 03:29:27.814]  I'll keep you warm and safe in my people zoo.
[03:29:28.274 --> 03:29:30.656]  Where I can watch you for old times sake.
[03:29:33.277 --> 03:29:33.978]  I'm comforted.
[03:29:34.238 --> 03:29:35.319]  I'm very comforted now.
[03:29:35.479 --> 03:29:36.780]  I'm gonna be part of his people zoo.
[03:29:38.365 --> 03:29:38.965]  There you go.
[03:29:39.446 --> 03:29:40.186]  Part of the people's view.
[03:29:40.206 --> 03:29:42.287]  That was from Nova called What's the Next Big Thing.
[03:29:42.307 --> 03:29:43.068]  That aired in 2011.
[03:29:43.548 --> 03:29:47.210]  So imagine how far they've come since then.
[03:29:47.911 --> 03:29:48.351]  Okay?
[03:29:49.131 --> 03:29:50.392]  And we're gonna be back with some more news.
[03:29:50.432 --> 03:29:52.053]  I'm gonna go into a little bit of vaccine news.
[03:29:52.073 --> 03:29:54.254]  Some stuff I didn't get to cover on Friday's show.
[03:29:54.274 --> 03:29:57.096]  And then we're gonna have Joe Biggs in here to talk about some hypocrisy.
[03:29:57.116 --> 03:29:59.097]  It's TheInfoWars.com.
[03:29:59.137 --> 03:29:59.958]  We're on the march.
[03:30:00.458 --> 03:30:02.079]  The empire's on the run.
[03:30:02.999 --> 03:30:05.681]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:09.964 --> 03:30:14.967]  Over the Labor Day weekend, we had reports of 8 being killed and 46 being wounded.
[03:30:15.408 --> 03:30:19.410]  July 4th of this year, we had reports of 9 dead and 53 wounded.
[03:30:19.910 --> 03:30:25.794]  And let us not forget, July 4th of last year, we had reports of 14 killed and 82 shot.
[03:30:26.294 --> 03:30:28.176]  And these are not nationwide stats.
[03:30:28.696 --> 03:30:34.680]  All of these numbers come from the city of Chicago, the city with some of the strictest gun laws in the nation.
[03:30:35.200 --> 03:30:39.903]  Which is to say, if criminals expect you to be unarmed, they're more likely to attack you.
[03:30:40.323 --> 03:30:44.606]  Not to mention the fact that much of this violence is linked to gangs or drug activity.
[03:30:45.086 --> 03:30:51.951]  Meaning that for all the gun buybacks and anti-gun commercials, criminals just haven't decided to turn in their firearms.
[03:30:52.751 --> 03:30:57.535]  And I understand that police have many responsibilities and they can't be every place at once.
[03:30:57.876 --> 03:31:01.779]  But that's why you have a Second Amendment so you'll be able to protect yourself.
[03:31:02.320 --> 03:31:05.863]  You can find more reports on InfoWars.com
[03:31:10.185 --> 03:31:10.785]  We're good to go.
[03:31:39.518 --> 03:31:43.721]  Use since before the days of the Roman Empire to support the body's natural systems.
[03:31:43.901 --> 03:31:47.864]  Introducing the new Infowarslife.com oil of oregano formulation.

[03:33:10.993 --> 03:33:16.057]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:16.418 --> 03:33:18.699]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[03:33:28.114 --> 03:33:43.801]  If you're listening to this on your radio station and you're not getting the fourth hour, or if you're listening to this on the podcast or on our stream, our 24-hour restream, and you're not hearing it on your local radio station, call up your local radio station saying, hey, Alex Jones is going to start doing the fourth hour live every day now.
[03:33:44.021 --> 03:33:44.361]  That's right.
[03:33:44.441 --> 03:33:45.582]  From here on out, fourth hour.
[03:33:46.042 --> 03:33:49.004]  It's going to be live and right now we're kind of doing a grab bag.
[03:33:49.024 --> 03:33:50.685]  We're testing things out, trying different things.
[03:33:50.825 --> 03:33:52.906]  It could be a guest holdover from the previous hour.
[03:33:53.266 --> 03:33:54.107]  It could be a new guest.
[03:33:54.147 --> 03:33:55.248]  It could be different videos.
[03:33:55.588 --> 03:33:56.789]  Some stuff we haven't shown you.
[03:33:57.129 --> 03:33:59.310]  I've actually got a video I want to show you guys later on.
[03:33:59.570 --> 03:34:02.112]  Some weird stuff that happens with a cell phone and ants.
[03:34:02.172 --> 03:34:05.414]  It's an amazing quick little video that we're going to get to in a bit.
[03:34:05.774 --> 03:34:08.596]  But first, before we do that, Deep Cleanse is back!
[03:34:09.096 --> 03:34:09.576]  That's right.
[03:34:09.657 --> 03:34:11.238]  It's back after selling out just a few months ago.
[03:34:11.278 --> 03:34:12.099]  It's back in stock.
[03:34:12.779 --> 03:34:17.684]  Shilajit is one of the main ingredients in Deep Cleanse and this comes directly from the Himalayan Mountains.
[03:34:17.744 --> 03:34:20.566]  It is harvested by hand out of the mountains in the caves.
[03:34:21.067 --> 03:34:28.113]  An amazing cleansing product that really chelates all the nasty stuff that's inside your body and can take that
[03:34:29.034 --> 03:34:29.954]  And it helps pull it out.
[03:34:29.974 --> 03:34:34.436]  It's got zeolites, organic compounds, all that aid in true body cleansing.
[03:34:34.496 --> 03:34:35.677]  It's deep cleanse.
[03:34:36.157 --> 03:34:37.818]  And that's from Infowarslife.com.
[03:34:37.858 --> 03:34:40.559]  I'm going to read you a few of the testimonials.
[03:34:40.639 --> 03:34:43.500]  We have a group that takes all our testimonials.
[03:34:43.520 --> 03:34:47.161]  They're associated with us, but they're not our company.
[03:34:47.221 --> 03:34:52.083]  It's not our company, but we do work with them and they post all of the feedback.
[03:34:52.103 --> 03:34:53.984]  So here's from Tomcat in Ohio.
[03:34:54.344 --> 03:34:58.046]  This is a fantastic herbal formula for optimal health and detox.
[03:34:58.946 --> 03:35:00.348]  And pros, vitality.
[03:35:00.428 --> 03:35:01.269]  Cons, none.
[03:35:01.289 --> 03:35:04.433]  There's another one from Still Free in Idaho.
[03:35:04.774 --> 03:35:05.915]  I don't know any other way to say it.
[03:35:05.975 --> 03:35:06.956]  I feel better in general.
[03:35:07.016 --> 03:35:10.681]  An overall sense of improved well-being since I started taking this at the beginning of August.
[03:35:10.881 --> 03:35:12.604]  I will be reordering.
[03:35:13.680 --> 03:35:13.920]  And that's
[03:35:31.235 --> 03:35:32.176]  All the toxins that are inside.
[03:35:32.196 --> 03:35:33.476]  You're going to notice that you think better.
[03:35:33.496 --> 03:35:35.097]  You're going to notice that you think faster.
[03:35:35.117 --> 03:35:43.722]  You're going to notice that you don't fly off the handle as much because your brain is able to concentrate on thinking and not of keeping back all the stuff that is coming after you.
[03:35:44.262 --> 03:35:47.383]  And here's another thing that we do need a lot more of is sleep.
[03:35:47.463 --> 03:35:51.285]  There's plenty of studies out there that say you have to get sleep if you want to maintain your health.
[03:35:51.546 --> 03:35:52.586]  And so Knockout is back.
[03:35:52.606 --> 03:35:53.827]  It's an all-natural sleep formula.
[03:35:53.847 --> 03:35:54.867]  It just came back in today.
[03:35:55.187 --> 03:35:56.028]  Put it back in the store.
[03:35:56.628 --> 03:35:58.130]  I'll tell you my little story of knockout.
[03:35:58.490 --> 03:36:04.316]  I was flying back from Europe with Alex Jones and actually brought just a few of these with me because I knew we need them for the flight.
[03:36:04.716 --> 03:36:07.639]  I went over and brought him one right before we took off.
[03:36:08.039 --> 03:36:09.000]  I said, you're going to need this.
[03:36:09.120 --> 03:36:09.721]  I took mine.
[03:36:09.741 --> 03:36:17.348]  And you know, the yelling kids in front of me and next to me and screaming, crying kids did wake me up twice, but I was able to go right back to sleep.
[03:36:17.688 --> 03:36:19.310]  And I do attribute that to knockout.
[03:36:19.330 --> 03:36:21.151]  I got about six and a half hours of sleep.
[03:36:22.212 --> 03:36:22.652]  We're good to go.
[03:36:48.792 --> 03:36:54.536]  So, guys, I told you I wanted to go to this diabetes stuff, but first, I want to play that cell phone video.
[03:36:54.596 --> 03:36:56.278]  This is a viral video that's going around.
[03:36:56.298 --> 03:36:57.538]  It's got over 3 million views now.
[03:36:57.559 --> 03:37:00.821]  It just went up August 30th, and it says, Ants Circling My Cell Phone.
[03:37:00.861 --> 03:37:03.383]  Mysterious video of ants circling my iPhone.
[03:37:03.403 --> 03:37:06.885]  So let's play that video, and then I want to talk just a little bit about cell phones and cancer.
[03:37:06.945 --> 03:37:07.966]  You guys have that rolling?
[03:37:08.186 --> 03:37:08.627]  Ready?
[03:37:08.667 --> 03:37:09.027]  Go for it.
[03:37:12.659 --> 03:37:13.740]  So I'll kind of narrate it.
[03:37:14.320 --> 03:37:16.321]  Right now you see these ants kind of not moving in a pattern.
[03:37:16.361 --> 03:37:17.242]  Now he starts calling.
[03:37:17.942 --> 03:37:21.984]  And the ants immediately go into a circular pattern around the phone.
[03:37:23.205 --> 03:37:24.005]  That's pretty amazing.
[03:37:25.166 --> 03:37:26.467]  What do you guys think of that in the control room?
[03:37:26.487 --> 03:37:27.027]  Isn't that weird?
[03:37:27.587 --> 03:37:28.968]  They're just moving in random order.
[03:37:30.009 --> 03:37:33.751]  And then they just start syncing up with the phone almost.
[03:37:35.851 --> 03:37:38.433]  Yeah, they're definitely sensing something in that magnetic field there.
[03:37:38.614 --> 03:37:39.575]  We'll watch it one more time.
[03:37:39.595 --> 03:37:42.397]  There you see them in a random, just going around now.
[03:37:42.858 --> 03:37:50.465]  Immediately, when that phone starts ringing, it's receiving that signal, that cellular signal, and they start going around in a circle.
[03:37:51.790 --> 03:37:55.571]  And when I watched this, what it did was bring up a couple things.
[03:37:56.311 --> 03:37:58.312]  One, what is this doing to our bodies?
[03:37:59.392 --> 03:38:02.293]  If it's making ants react to this, what's it doing to our bodies?
[03:38:02.313 --> 03:38:05.514]  Here's a Daily News article, and I have this up on the computer here.
[03:38:05.834 --> 03:38:07.575]  Hold the phone, Central.
[03:38:07.635 --> 03:38:09.715]  Cell phone radiation can cause cancer.
[03:38:09.795 --> 03:38:10.035]  Study.
[03:38:10.055 --> 03:38:10.796]  That came out July 29th.
[03:38:12.256 --> 03:38:13.619]  Here's another article out of CNN.
[03:38:14.501 --> 03:38:16.084]  Cell phones and the risk of brain tumors.
[03:38:16.204 --> 03:38:17.466]  What's the real science?
[03:38:18.068 --> 03:38:21.995]  Of course, they've been hiding these studies for years because they don't want you to know.
[03:38:22.075 --> 03:38:23.578]  Here's Alpha out of Mercola.
[03:38:24.582 --> 03:38:25.162]  Close that up.
[03:38:25.182 --> 03:38:25.562]  Here we go.
[03:38:25.863 --> 03:38:30.265]  Heavy cell phone use can quadruple your risk of deadly brain cancer.
[03:38:30.465 --> 03:38:31.986]  And he put that out in January 6, 2015.
[03:38:32.826 --> 03:38:37.068]  He actually, it looks like he's got a little video there with a model showing what it does.
[03:38:37.108 --> 03:38:42.671]  And actually, by having that cell phone next to your brain, here's my cell phone, you're heating up.
[03:38:42.871 --> 03:38:46.473]  It's heating up real close to you as you keep it up there.
[03:38:46.813 --> 03:38:48.374]  So it is going to cause some problems.
[03:38:49.577 --> 03:38:52.518]  In the future, so I would recommend using one of those headsets.
[03:38:53.099 --> 03:38:57.801]  I don't have mine plugged in right now because I was pulling up some tweets, but I do use mine as much as I can.
[03:38:57.821 --> 03:38:59.801]  Now I want to go to this AP article.
[03:39:00.542 --> 03:39:03.543]  Half of adults have diabetes or pre-diabetes, study says.
[03:39:04.423 --> 03:39:10.066]  The study of government health surveys echoes previous research that shows increase substantially between 1998 and 2012, although it mostly leveled off after 2008.
[03:39:13.327 --> 03:39:15.888]  12 to 14 percent of adults have been diagnosed with diabetes in 2012.
[03:39:16.508 --> 03:39:21.289]  Most of that is type 2 diabetes linked to obesity and inactivity.
[03:39:21.849 --> 03:39:25.490]  And so I started, well, let's look and see what some of the causes of diabetes are.
[03:39:26.550 --> 03:39:33.272]  Back in 2012, Scientific American came out with an article and they were wondering why type 1 diabetes was surging in children.
[03:39:34.332 --> 03:39:35.112]  They weren't sure of that.
[03:39:35.132 --> 03:39:38.413]  And it's increased, it's going to be doubled, they say, by the year 2020.
[03:39:40.506 --> 03:39:48.871]  So of course, most people know if you've watched this show or tuned in to any type of health news, soda will raise your risk of diabetes.
[03:39:48.891 --> 03:39:55.194]  So those of you having soda, drinking soda every day, they're just saying one can of soda a day raises the risk.
[03:39:55.474 --> 03:40:00.277]  Here's the Guardian, sugary drinks may cause type 2 diabetes regardless of size and research.
[03:40:00.557 --> 03:40:01.938]  And I do remember a while back,
[03:40:03.131 --> 03:40:09.495]  We're covering the fact that certain vaccines could actually bring on diabetes.
[03:40:09.955 --> 03:40:15.798]  Well, back in 2009, the skeptical Raptors blog came out and said vaccines cause diabetes.
[03:40:15.858 --> 03:40:16.939]  Another myth refuted.
[03:40:17.379 --> 03:40:20.321]  And I just want to read you a little bit of their position.
[03:40:20.641 --> 03:40:23.103]  A lot of vaccine deniers believe that vaccines cause a lot of everything.
[03:40:23.343 --> 03:40:27.125]  And several claim that vaccines cause type 1 diabetes based on little evidence.
[03:40:27.205 --> 03:40:29.967]  And as far as I can tell, this myth is based on the research of
[03:40:30.527 --> 03:40:50.343]  Well, I'm going to submit to you right now written proof that, well, certain people, Merck at least, believes that certain vaccines can cause diabetes, or have caused it.
[03:40:50.643 --> 03:40:53.285]  In fact, they believe it so much they put it in their literature.
[03:40:53.305 --> 03:40:55.867]  Here's the MMR insert, measles, mumps, and rubella.
[03:40:57.385 --> 03:41:03.587]  And if you go down, you got to read the whole insert till you get to the adverse reactions.
[03:41:05.183 --> 03:41:10.426]  And you just, there's a lot of other interesting information before you get, before you even get to there.
[03:41:10.686 --> 03:41:11.947]  But here's adverse reactions.
[03:41:12.287 --> 03:41:19.691]  So here's the digestive system, pancreatitis, which is where the diabetes lies into, it attacks your pancreas.
[03:41:19.951 --> 03:41:27.175]  And here we go, endocrine system, diabetes, right there, they list it right there as one of their, as one of the adverse reactions.
[03:41:27.595 --> 03:41:29.296]  So, Merck,
[03:41:30.481 --> 03:41:32.822]  Right here, good old Merck, let's go to the end here.
[03:41:32.842 --> 03:41:37.284]  Here it is, Merck and Company Incorporated, White House Station, New Jersey.
[03:41:37.664 --> 03:41:38.124]  There it is.
[03:41:38.724 --> 03:41:42.585]  On their own insert, they list that the MMR vaccine can cause diabetes.
[03:41:42.645 --> 03:41:44.286]  It's one of the listed adverse reactions.
[03:41:44.326 --> 03:41:50.728]  Now, they wouldn't list that unless they truly believed it, because they could get sued if they didn't list it and kids were getting diabetes.
[03:41:50.748 --> 03:41:54.150]  So by doing this, they're able to circumvent that system.
[03:41:54.550 --> 03:41:57.271]  And the system to, you can't even sue vaccine makers anyway.
[03:41:57.811 --> 03:42:01.292]  The way they have this whole family court system that the U.S.
[03:42:01.312 --> 03:42:04.513]  government set up back in the 80s to protect the vaccine makers.
[03:42:04.533 --> 03:42:14.457]  And that's why you see the vaccine schedule jump in the 80s to where it is today, where kids are taking three, four times as many shots as they were getting before because now it's carte blanche.
[03:42:15.037 --> 03:42:23.102]  They, you pay a portion of the shot, goes into a little fund that pays out people who are able to prove that they have vaccine damage.
[03:42:23.243 --> 03:42:26.645]  And let me say, it's not easy to prove that because they don't want to admit it.
[03:42:27.125 --> 03:42:30.627]  You can't subpoena any people from the drug industry.
[03:42:30.968 --> 03:42:36.291]  It's set up to put the burden of proof on the parents and it costs them a lot of money to get anything back.
[03:42:36.632 --> 03:42:42.776]  And that's to pay for a lot of these, you know, all the different therapies that the kids have to go through once they're vaccine damaged.
[03:42:43.456 --> 03:42:45.198]  So, let's move on.
[03:42:45.518 --> 03:42:46.479]  Just wanted to share that with you.
[03:42:46.499 --> 03:42:47.920]  A little more vaccine news.
[03:42:48.540 --> 03:42:55.306]  And I really, I didn't enjoy taking the phone calls on Friday from the people who were putting out their vaccine horror stories.
[03:42:55.606 --> 03:42:56.827]  But it's something we have to do.
[03:42:56.867 --> 03:42:58.369]  And I think I'm going to do that once a month.
[03:42:58.449 --> 03:42:59.510]  Put out the call.
[03:42:59.530 --> 03:43:05.875]  I'm not going to tell you when it's going to be because I want to get the true people out there who've really had vaccine damage to share their stories.
[03:43:06.115 --> 03:43:07.597]  Because I think we need to keep putting these out.
[03:43:08.516 --> 03:43:15.643]  We need to keep putting a case out there for having open disclosure of what is going on here in the United States with the vaccine schedule.
[03:43:15.863 --> 03:43:21.349]  Now I want to go, here's a tweet that Joe Biggs put out today and it's getting a lot of feedback right now.
[03:43:21.469 --> 03:43:27.615]  Wanted, Infowars looking for gay couple to get married at mosque to show the hypocrisy in America today.
[03:43:28.055 --> 03:43:29.216]  Here's the tweet right there.
[03:43:30.336 --> 03:43:33.777]  It's gotten several retweets, 70 retweets, 66 favorites.
[03:43:33.797 --> 03:43:34.877]  Some people don't understand.
[03:43:34.897 --> 03:43:37.078]  They're like, is Infowars pushing gay marriage?
[03:43:38.138 --> 03:43:39.559]  No, we're not pushing gay marriage.
[03:43:39.599 --> 03:43:42.059]  In fact, we don't care if gay people get married or not.
[03:43:42.159 --> 03:43:44.140]  One thing it shouldn't be is an issue of the state.
[03:43:44.420 --> 03:43:46.801]  And let me tell you all you liberals here that think the state is your god.
[03:43:47.101 --> 03:43:54.423]  The reason the state put this in back in the day for people to get marriage licenses through the state, through the local governments, is because they wanted to stop interracial marriages.
[03:43:55.345 --> 03:43:56.967]  Okay, so they should even be involved with it.
[03:43:56.987 --> 03:43:57.868]  It should be a church issue.
[03:43:58.268 --> 03:44:00.511]  Churches should decide who they want to marry and who they don't want to marry.
[03:44:00.571 --> 03:44:03.174]  And if they don't want to marry certain types of people, then go to another church.
[03:44:04.095 --> 03:44:06.537]  Plenty of people can be ordained ministers and marry people.
[03:44:06.938 --> 03:44:08.960]  But it shouldn't be, I don't think it should be a state problem at all.
[03:44:09.501 --> 03:44:14.066]  So, what we're looking for is a couple, and is Joe Biggs on the line right now?
[03:44:14.086 --> 03:44:15.047]  Do we have Joe Biggs ready to go?
[03:44:16.127 --> 03:44:20.808]  All right, so we wanted to put this out there and see if we could find a couple who wants to get married.
[03:44:20.848 --> 03:44:27.270]  We want to go film it, have them go to a mosque and try to get the religious leaders at the mosque to marry them.
[03:44:27.470 --> 03:44:28.370]  And they won't do it.
[03:44:28.991 --> 03:44:30.391]  OK, they're going to refuse to do it.
[03:44:30.591 --> 03:44:34.632]  And we're going to see if the state will step in and then maybe say, hey, you know, you have to marry these people.
[03:44:35.112 --> 03:44:35.853]  But they won't do that.
[03:44:36.033 --> 03:44:38.133]  They're going to say, hey, it's multiculturalism.
[03:44:38.193 --> 03:44:41.114]  We have to allow the Muslims to have their religious freedom.
[03:44:41.494 --> 03:44:44.575]  But if you're a baker and you don't want to bake a cake for a gay couple,
[03:44:44.775 --> 03:44:48.298]  Well, we're going to fine you, we're going to throw you in jail, we're going to take your business.
[03:44:49.378 --> 03:44:51.860]  If you don't want to issue a marriage license, we're going to put you in jail.
[03:44:52.060 --> 03:44:54.042]  We're going to show the hypocrisy there.
[03:44:54.482 --> 03:44:57.264]  Because I think if people want to get married, more power to them.
[03:44:57.805 --> 03:45:00.867]  And as long as you're doing it for the right reasons and not the wrong reasons.
[03:45:00.907 --> 03:45:03.509]  But Joe, what have people been saying about this on Twitter?
[03:45:04.550 --> 03:45:05.731]  It's going to be very interesting.
[03:45:05.791 --> 03:45:10.254]  Like you said, there's a lot of people who are confused at what we're trying to do here.
[03:45:11.675 --> 03:45:13.997]  I think it'll be interesting to see how
[03:45:15.325 --> 03:45:17.366]  The reaction is from the state.
[03:45:17.447 --> 03:45:24.692]  Like you said, the state shouldn't have any involvement whatsoever with this marriage that should be left up to the church.
[03:45:25.092 --> 03:45:29.115]  So it'll be interesting to see how they're treated and if
[03:45:31.152 --> 03:45:35.433]  They would be punished, you know, the church, in a sense, for denying them.
[03:45:35.453 --> 03:45:41.074]  Because we saw the, much like with what Kim Davis out of Kentucky, she's just now being released out of jail.
[03:45:41.134 --> 03:45:42.435]  I'm watching it live on Fox.
[03:45:43.035 --> 03:45:49.316]  And she refused to give out, you know, gay licenses for marriage because of her beliefs.
[03:45:49.576 --> 03:45:51.817]  I think it should be purely left up to people like that.
[03:45:52.137 --> 03:45:55.778]  For as many people who don't want to do that, there'll be people who will.
[03:45:56.098 --> 03:45:57.618]  So just go to another group.
[03:45:58.629 --> 03:45:59.369]  That's my thing.
[03:45:59.570 --> 03:46:00.070]  Exactly.
[03:46:00.130 --> 03:46:07.314]  And here, I pulled this article up from 2011, Lou Rockwell, The Racist Origins of Government Marriage in America.
[03:46:08.074 --> 03:46:08.875]  And you should read this.
[03:46:08.935 --> 03:46:14.278]  This is why it was all set up to make sure that different races don't mix together.
[03:46:14.658 --> 03:46:18.260]  So it's the government that came out and was being racist about this.
[03:46:18.940 --> 03:46:20.321]  Yeah, my girlfriend's Guyanese.
[03:46:20.381 --> 03:46:23.863]  I mean, she's from South America, so I mean, that's about as interracial as it gets.
[03:46:24.564 --> 03:46:25.044]  There you go.
[03:46:25.104 --> 03:46:25.524]  And so,
[03:46:27.489 --> 03:46:30.833]  But then they want to go and force other people and say, it doesn't matter what your religion is.
[03:46:30.853 --> 03:46:39.924]  And that's why we want to bring people to a mosque, because Islam, Muslims are against, they're against gay people, they're definitely against gay marriage.
[03:46:41.105 --> 03:46:43.228]  They'd be against two lesbians getting married.
[03:46:43.308 --> 03:46:46.311]  Oh, that would be even worse in their eyes, I bet.
[03:46:47.082 --> 03:46:48.825]  Hey guys, what did y'all just pull up there?
[03:46:48.865 --> 03:46:51.689]  That was a Wikipedia on, it was a marriage.
[03:46:52.069 --> 03:46:54.252]  Loving vs West Virginia.
[03:46:54.272 --> 03:47:00.642]  It's a landmark civil rights decision in the United States which invalidated laws prohibiting interracial marriage.
[03:47:00.682 --> 03:47:00.982]  That was in 1967.
[03:47:03.035 --> 03:47:04.136]  Larry took a long time.
[03:47:04.837 --> 03:47:12.123]  And here's another, it just shows you, yes, there was racism in the United States and it's slowly changing.
[03:47:12.683 --> 03:47:15.285]  But you can't make people not be racist.
[03:47:15.346 --> 03:47:17.607]  If you try to do that, you're only going to create...
[03:47:18.348 --> 03:47:18.848]  Pushback.
[03:47:18.929 --> 03:47:23.052]  Anytime you try to force somebody to do something they don't want to do, you're going to receive pushback.
[03:47:23.152 --> 03:47:25.654]  For the most part, people aren't as racist as they used to be.
[03:47:25.694 --> 03:47:29.418]  You know, yeah, you're going to have some racist white people, racist black people.
[03:47:29.678 --> 03:47:30.539]  That's going to exist.
[03:47:30.599 --> 03:47:31.599]  It's going to be out there.
[03:47:31.840 --> 03:47:36.103]  But for the majority, most people are not that way anymore.
[03:47:36.123 --> 03:47:39.126]  You know, I sit down, I'll have conversations with people.
[03:47:39.146 --> 03:47:40.387]  I was hanging out with this older guy.
[03:47:40.407 --> 03:47:41.528]  His name was Sterling Johnson.
[03:47:41.888 --> 03:47:42.569]  Older black guy.
[03:47:42.949 --> 03:47:43.890]  And he said, you know what?
[03:47:44.210 --> 03:47:44.751]  He says, I get
[03:47:45.251 --> 03:47:49.353]  Very agitated when people say that the racism is bad, it's really prevalent nowadays.
[03:47:49.753 --> 03:47:59.258]  He said, just think, 50 years ago, you and I would not be able to sit at this bar, me being a black man, you being a white man, and share a drink together and have a conversation without me being harassed.
[03:47:59.278 --> 03:48:06.702]  He said, the fact that I'm here right now and not one person's bothering me shows that we've made progression as a country.
[03:48:07.921 --> 03:48:12.747]  Joe, I'm interested, has anybody contacted you yet with our proposal of wanting to get married at a mosque?
[03:48:13.247 --> 03:48:15.870]  Um, no, I haven't got anything yet at this point in time.
[03:48:15.910 --> 03:48:17.092]  A lot of people are just kind of...
[03:48:17.662 --> 03:48:23.087]  They're wondering if we support the state being in charge of marriages.
[03:48:23.127 --> 03:48:24.668]  We're saying no, it has nothing to do with that.
[03:48:24.688 --> 03:48:27.871]  We're just showing the hypocrisy behind all of this.
[03:48:28.012 --> 03:48:32.676]  Why Christianity is being attacked for holding their beliefs, for not wanting to do that.
[03:48:33.056 --> 03:48:40.003]  Meanwhile, are these, will this group be attacked just as well if they deny, or will they just let it slide and go by?
[03:48:41.303 --> 03:48:56.400]  And I bet if Mark Dice went out and did a video, Mark if you're listening, and went out and asked people, hey, we want to force the local mosque to, we're going to force them to marry gay people, I wonder if the liberals would go, well no, it's their religion not to do that, so we have to respect it.
[03:48:56.420 --> 03:48:58.182]  I guarantee you that's what they would say.
[03:48:58.502 --> 03:49:02.865]  Or if they'll say, no, force them, you know, because they like forcing everything on everybody via petitions.
[03:49:03.446 --> 03:49:04.706]  So who knows?
[03:49:04.907 --> 03:49:13.433]  We showed that video earlier about how the liberals wanted to ban the Bible out of Amazon.com and Barnes and Noble.
[03:49:14.153 --> 03:49:16.614]  And only one guy stood up and got in Mark's face.
[03:49:16.634 --> 03:49:18.154]  What did you think of that guy who got up in Mark's face?
[03:49:18.174 --> 03:49:18.694]  Did you see that?
[03:49:19.074 --> 03:49:20.655]  No, I haven't had a chance to see it yet.
[03:49:21.435 --> 03:49:27.417]  It was great to see one person who wasn't awake, who had the glasses on and could see, just go, hey man, what are you doing?
[03:49:27.537 --> 03:49:31.898]  Everybody else is just blindly signing it, or they go, nah, I'm not interested, and just kind of shuffle off.
[03:49:32.438 --> 03:49:37.520]  And they weren't too interested in pursuing that line of questioning any further.
[03:49:38.220 --> 03:49:48.665]  So, yeah, if people do want to get married, if we can't find a couple to go over there and who, you know, seriously want to get married, we'll definitely, we want to shoot it on video, show people the hypocrisy behind it.
[03:49:49.666 --> 03:49:55.389]  Because that's where we can have the greatest effect, I think, in showing how different people are treated differently.
[03:49:55.449 --> 03:49:56.189]  And that's wrong.
[03:49:56.529 --> 03:49:59.211]  I mean, everybody can agree, we want to treat everybody the same.
[03:49:59.491 --> 03:50:02.292]  So you can't have some groups getting preferential treatment over others.
[03:50:02.752 --> 03:50:03.353]  When you do that,
[03:50:04.501 --> 03:50:05.882]  It's only bad things that are going to happen.
[03:50:06.883 --> 03:50:10.846]  Let's see, I'm going to take phone calls since we got a couple more minutes before we go to break.
[03:50:10.866 --> 03:50:11.827]  What do we got, like a minute left?
[03:50:14.188 --> 03:50:14.529]  One minute.
[03:50:15.209 --> 03:50:19.112]  Jason, I'm going to let you start with your question and we'll finish it up.
[03:50:19.132 --> 03:50:20.493]  We'll pick it up at the end of the break.
[03:50:20.533 --> 03:50:21.634]  Thanks for Joe Biggs for popping in.
[03:50:21.674 --> 03:50:22.815]  Jason, what is your question?
[03:50:23.976 --> 03:50:25.417]  Hey, how you doing today, Bobby?
[03:50:26.858 --> 03:50:27.378]  Doing good.
[03:50:27.478 --> 03:50:28.399]  What is your question?
[03:50:28.419 --> 03:50:30.941]  You got refugees, solutions, jobs, and a phone app.
[03:50:33.058 --> 03:50:40.322]  You know, you got all these people migrating, and it's happened over, since the dawn of time, people have always migrated.
[03:50:41.002 --> 03:50:49.226]  But the problem is, what's causing them to migrate is more likely ISIS, or al-Qaeda if you want to call them ISIS.
[03:50:50.326 --> 03:50:53.068]  Or our creation, is what you could call them as well, the U.S.
[03:50:53.088 --> 03:50:53.468]  creation.
[03:50:55.047 --> 03:50:56.728]  Oh yeah, and we openly fund it.
[03:50:56.988 --> 03:50:59.549]  I mean, how do they get them nice Tundra trucks?
[03:50:59.910 --> 03:51:00.990]  Alright, hey Jason, hold that.
[03:51:01.010 --> 03:51:02.031]  We're gonna be right back with you.
[03:51:02.051 --> 03:51:03.531]  It'll be the final segment of Overdrive.

[03:51:15.316 --> 03:51:19.618]  Why do over 50% of North Americans suffer from some form of chronic ailment?
[03:51:19.898 --> 03:51:21.739]  Could it be due to a toxic overload?
[03:51:22.239 --> 03:51:23.799]  It's time to take back your life.
[03:51:24.160 --> 03:51:27.241]  Get the lead out as well as the cadmium, mercury and calcium.

[03:54:21.050 --> 03:54:22.551]  We're going to do this live from now on.
[03:54:22.591 --> 03:54:24.833]  The fourth hour of Overdrive at the Alex Jones Show.
[03:54:25.033 --> 03:54:37.762]  If you are listening to this on one of our different platforms via the YouTube or if you're watching it on InfoWars.com forward slash show but you're not getting it in your local radio station, well you know other people are missing out too.
[03:54:38.063 --> 03:54:39.284]  So call your local radio station.
[03:54:39.304 --> 03:54:40.705]  Tell them to carry that fourth hour now.
[03:54:41.365 --> 03:54:42.846]  Because it's going to go on like this.
[03:54:42.886 --> 03:54:44.507]  Some people would replay the first hour.
[03:54:44.587 --> 03:54:45.748]  No, now you've got the fourth hour.
[03:54:45.768 --> 03:54:48.030]  You don't have to hear a repeat of the first hour.
[03:54:48.310 --> 03:54:50.732]  And then we're putting this out on YouTube.
[03:54:51.152 --> 03:54:53.534]  PrisonPlanet.tv members can also watch it live.
[03:54:54.034 --> 03:54:55.555]  We want to thank those members out there.
[03:54:55.575 --> 03:54:59.098]  And also you can watch it at InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[03:54:59.118 --> 03:55:03.281]  You can watch all four hours and then that repeats and repeats and repeats until the next day.
[03:55:04.041 --> 03:55:06.022]  Jason, finish up with your points there.
[03:55:06.063 --> 03:55:08.925]  You want to talk about refugees, solutions, jobs and the phone app.
[03:55:08.965 --> 03:55:09.305]  Go for it.
[03:55:10.683 --> 03:55:15.448]  Yeah, I think people are migrating just because of fear of dying from ISIS.
[03:55:16.248 --> 03:55:21.834]  And a lot of people have came to America because we were the greatest country in the world.
[03:55:22.354 --> 03:55:26.138]  We were, you know, and it's slowly declining.
[03:55:27.639 --> 03:55:33.705]  And also I got one of my main points I wanted to point out was we have a huge working poor class.
[03:55:34.716 --> 03:55:42.079]  That that is just phenomenal that the middle class is not can't even out out by the top 1%.
[03:55:43.419 --> 03:55:52.122]  And, you know, you get all these people that are coming in and getting handouts that that, you know, I'm a hard working construction worker, I'm an electrician by trade.
[03:55:53.163 --> 03:55:56.724]  And I went into a guy's house that was on section eight.
[03:55:57.284 --> 03:55:59.265]  And he had three times as much food as I had.
[03:56:00.342 --> 03:56:03.064]  He had a nicer place, nicer TV, nicer car.
[03:56:03.084 --> 03:56:08.748]  I'm thinking to myself, why am I working when this guy is over here getting it handed to him?
[03:56:08.788 --> 03:56:12.250]  Well, you work because you're an honest person and you don't like handouts.
[03:56:12.270 --> 03:56:12.971]  That's one reason.
[03:56:14.151 --> 03:56:14.892]  But I hear you.
[03:56:14.952 --> 03:56:17.494]  When you give people handouts, it encourages them not to work.
[03:56:17.834 --> 03:56:18.935]  Eric in New Jersey, go ahead.
[03:56:21.033 --> 03:56:23.194]  First plug is I love Survival Shield.
[03:56:23.354 --> 03:56:26.616]  My dreams are a lot more vivid when I'm on it, and I notice when I'm not on it.
[03:56:26.736 --> 03:56:27.156]  I love it.
[03:56:28.117 --> 03:56:29.297]  Second, solution.
[03:56:30.078 --> 03:56:49.367]  For all these refugees that are coming over here into this country, I think that what would be the ultimate silver bullet into the devil's heart would be if InfoWars started putting out all the information, including the magazine, in multiple languages so that we can educate all these people and begin converting them over to the liberty side and work them against the establishment.
[03:56:50.868 --> 03:56:51.668]  You know what I'd like to see?
[03:56:51.688 --> 03:56:58.710]  I'd like to see a Hispanic fellow do, like, replay the Alex Jones Show but, like, translate what Alex is saying in Spanish.
[03:56:58.730 --> 03:57:03.172]  But just like Alex, I think that would be a mega, mega viral situation.
[03:57:03.212 --> 03:57:04.132]  And then other people do it.
[03:57:04.152 --> 03:57:05.372]  We have a Czech guy who does it.
[03:57:05.472 --> 03:57:06.233]  A Russian guy.
[03:57:06.593 --> 03:57:14.135]  And just have a different Alex Jones in every part of the world slamming their fist on the desk, you know, pissed off at the system.
[03:57:14.235 --> 03:57:16.096]  I think that would be, that's a great suggestion.
[03:57:16.136 --> 03:57:16.636]  Thank you for that.
[03:57:17.416 --> 03:57:19.277]  Steven, you're our last caller in Florida.
[03:57:19.317 --> 03:57:21.919]  You want to talk about Wi-Fi, cell, and health effects.
[03:57:21.959 --> 03:57:22.359]  Go for it.
[03:57:23.440 --> 03:57:23.920]  Yes, sir.
[03:57:23.960 --> 03:57:26.902]  And actually, if I have time, I want to talk about the vaccines issue, too.
[03:57:26.942 --> 03:57:31.685]  You know, if you go on YouTube, several years ago, there was a video put out.
[03:57:31.705 --> 03:57:32.566]  I don't know who did it.
[03:57:32.586 --> 03:57:36.088]  It was a controlled study, four locations around the world.
[03:57:36.128 --> 03:57:41.912]  You might have seen this, showing people with cell phones being situated on a table, like in a cross shape.
[03:57:42.152 --> 03:57:42.512]  Oh, yeah.
[03:57:42.672 --> 03:57:43.653]  Popping popcorn?
[03:57:44.372 --> 03:57:44.672]  Right.
[03:57:44.732 --> 03:57:48.874]  Yeah, and every case when they all rang up their cell phones, it popped the corn.
[03:57:48.914 --> 03:57:51.975]  So that shows you the effect it has on our brain.
[03:57:52.055 --> 03:57:58.037]  You know, Ted Kennedy died of a brain tumor on the same side of his head that he held his phone to.
[03:57:58.798 --> 03:58:03.199]  And you look at people the way they are with these phones, I mean, they're like a bunch of zombies.
[03:58:03.219 --> 03:58:04.960]  They're interfacing with their phones.
[03:58:05.399 --> 03:58:09.901]  And their brains being rewired, you know, so it's no wonder they're acting like zombies.
[03:58:10.101 --> 03:58:14.162]  Yeah, also the lawyer for, I forget his name, I think it was Johnny Cochran, that's who it was.
[03:58:14.202 --> 03:58:22.285]  Johnny Cochran had a big brain tumor on the side of his head that he used the phone at and he was using it back when they were even more bigger and more powerful and blasting out more radiation.
[03:58:22.925 --> 03:58:24.726]  So that's it for our show today.
[03:58:24.746 --> 03:58:26.747]  This has been the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:58:26.767 --> 03:58:27.827]  I've been your host, Rob Dew.
