[00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.940]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:16.769]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:23.413 --> 00:00:26.836]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show on this Sunday, June 7th, 2015.
[00:00:26.836 --> 00:00:27.897]  I'm David Knight.
[00:00:27.897 --> 00:00:29.979]  I'll be your host here in the studio.
[00:00:29.979 --> 00:00:32.141]  Alex Jones is going to be co-hosting with us today.
[00:00:32.141 --> 00:00:37.906]  He's going to be joining us in the next segment to break down something that we just found out about.
[00:00:37.906 --> 00:00:40.168]  Of course, we see all these international agreements that are being made.
[00:00:40.848 --> 00:00:47.451]  One of these international agreements that is coming not from the trade treaties, but it's actually coming from the State Department.
[00:00:47.451 --> 00:00:54.653]  See, we have all these bureaucracies that are writing rules and regulations that have the effect of law.
[00:00:54.653 --> 00:01:01.676]  They've already bypassed our elected representatives in so many areas, it's hardly even a surprise that we've got now
[00:01:02.316 --> 00:01:07.358]  Sovereignty changing massive agreements that aren't just about trade and they certainly aren't about free trade.
[00:01:07.358 --> 00:01:10.300]  They're about a crony capitalism kind of trade.
[00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:14.122]  This is what we saw with the banker bailouts.
[00:01:14.122 --> 00:01:17.263]  This is the kind of quote-unquote free trade that we're getting with these trade agreements.
[00:01:17.263 --> 00:01:23.366]  But we see these regulations coming in from various bureaucracies all of the time writing their own laws.
[00:01:23.926 --> 00:01:32.292]  Congress creates these organizations like the EPA, like the IRS, like the ATF, all these different organizations that then go off and write their rules.
[00:01:32.292 --> 00:01:40.838]  The FCC coming out and taking over the Internet, for example, just claiming that they have control over it and they're now going to rewrite the rules.
[00:01:40.838 --> 00:01:42.920]  So they're going to exert control.
[00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.721]  It wasn't even given to them by Congress.
[00:01:44.721 --> 00:01:48.784]  They just claim it, name it and claim it, and then they start writing rules for it.
[00:01:48.784 --> 00:01:49.965]  So now we've got the State Department
[00:01:50.365 --> 00:01:56.970]  Who's coming out and saying that they're going to have regulations that are going to govern international arms trade.
[00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:58.452]  That sounds familiar, doesn't it?
[00:01:58.452 --> 00:02:02.135]  Remember the UN Arms Trade Treaty that they tried so many times to get through?
[00:02:02.135 --> 00:02:04.056]  They actually called it a treaty.
[00:02:04.056 --> 00:02:05.397]  Maybe that's why they couldn't get it through.
[00:02:05.397 --> 00:02:09.541]  They made the mistake of not calling it an agreement or a partnership.
[00:02:10.495 --> 00:02:15.681]  Now we're going to talk about why these trade agreements are really treaties.
[00:02:15.681 --> 00:02:21.107]  And of course, I'm very happy to see now Rand Paul and Senator Jeff Sessions.
[00:02:21.107 --> 00:02:23.069]  I always get them confused with Pete Sessions.
[00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:25.091]  Pete Sessions is on the wrong side of this, folks.
[00:02:25.091 --> 00:02:31.338]  He's a congressman and he is pushing for a fast-tracked agreement for trade treaties that he has not read.
[00:02:31.938 --> 00:02:35.380]  Pete Sessions, Senator Sessions, is a hero on this.
[00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:43.845]  He's gone to actually read this, as has Rand Paul, and they're both speaking out on this, saying that this is not a trade agreement.
[00:02:43.845 --> 00:02:46.587]  This is, in fact, a treaty.
[00:02:46.587 --> 00:02:50.589]  This whole thing is treachery, quite frankly.
[00:02:50.589 --> 00:02:57.213]  It is treachery to even call it something other than a treaty, because they didn't have the votes to pass Fast Track if it was a treaty.
[00:02:57.213 --> 00:02:57.753]  They had 62 votes.
[00:02:58.934 --> 00:03:04.075]  If they came up and honestly said that this was a treaty, they would have needed 67 votes.
[00:03:04.075 --> 00:03:05.156]  That's why they called an agreement.
[00:03:05.156 --> 00:03:06.496]  That's why they called a partnership.
[00:03:06.496 --> 00:03:08.417]  And of course, NAFTA was passed that way.
[00:03:08.417 --> 00:03:11.737]  They called it the North American Free Trade Agreement.
[00:03:11.737 --> 00:03:24.081]  But now if you go back and look at what they're telling people when it comes up to investor state tribunals, the same thing that we now see being applied with these Trans-Pacific, Trans-Atlantic partnerships,
[00:03:24.801 --> 00:03:28.342]  These tribunals, I guess we should call them IS, right?
[00:03:28.342 --> 00:03:29.303]  Investor State.
[00:03:29.303 --> 00:03:32.824]  It's another kind of IS, also created by the same people.
[00:03:32.824 --> 00:03:36.965]  But these tribunals, they say, really are treaty law claims.
[00:03:36.965 --> 00:03:43.888]  So the people who are representing the corporations, the multinational corporations, in these arbitration agreements are quite
[00:03:44.548 --> 00:03:47.429]  Clear about the fact that they are practicing treaty law.
[00:03:47.429 --> 00:03:56.390]  Look, treaty is any kind of an agreement between one or more nations that affects commerce or peace or various other aspects.
[00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:57.570]  This is a treaty.
[00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:01.531]  So the first thing they do is lie about it being a treaty so they don't have to get the votes.
[00:04:01.531 --> 00:04:02.851]  Senator Sessions has seen this.
[00:04:02.851 --> 00:04:04.812]  He's written a very scathing letter.
[00:04:04.812 --> 00:04:07.892]  We're going to talk about that in detail in the next segment.
[00:04:07.892 --> 00:04:10.173]  Alex Jones is going to be co-hosting with us throughout this hour.
[00:04:10.173 --> 00:04:11.353]  He's going to be talking about
[00:04:11.833 --> 00:04:11.953]  Yes.
[00:04:29.096 --> 00:04:31.538]  Publications, technical publications about firearms.
[00:04:31.538 --> 00:04:35.142]  And of course, this could be extended to anything.
[00:04:35.142 --> 00:04:39.646]  This is a way of destroying the Second Amendment using the First Amendment.
[00:04:39.646 --> 00:04:43.730]  And these are regulations that are being passed by the State Department.
[00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:44.230]  Stay with us.
[00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:46.332]  In the next segment, Alex Jones is going to break this down.
[00:04:46.332 --> 00:04:46.773]  Be right back.
[00:04:58.752 --> 00:05:01.274]  Today's top stories for June 5th, 2015.
[00:05:01.274 --> 00:05:05.858]  TPP begins to unravel as Obama launches final push for votes.
[00:05:05.858 --> 00:05:24.414]  Article by Paul Joseph Watson, the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade package is beginning to unravel with more prominent voices slamming President Obama and the Republican leadership over the secretive deal that threatens to cost American jobs and hand big corporations new powers that would violate national sovereignty.
[00:05:24.414 --> 00:05:25.395]  Hunting for hackers,
[00:05:25.595 --> 00:05:28.656]  NSA secretly expands internet spying at U.S.
[00:05:28.656 --> 00:05:29.256]  border.
[00:05:29.256 --> 00:05:41.140]  Article by New York Times, without public notice or debate, the Obama administration has expanded the NSA's warrantless surveillance of Americans' international internet traffic according to a classified NSA document.
[00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:55.175]  In mid-2012, Justice Department lawyers wrote two secret memos permitting the spy agency to begin hunting on internet cables without a warrant and on American soil for data linked to computer intrusions originating abroad.
[00:05:55.175 --> 00:05:57.638]  You can find more reports like this at InfoWars.com
[00:06:03.872 --> 00:06:15.701]  It was easier to control a million people, literally, it was easier to control a million people than physically to kill a million people.
[00:06:15.701 --> 00:06:21.485]  Today, it is infinitely easier to kill a million people than to control.
[00:06:30.669 --> 00:06:32.574]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:06:32.574 --> 00:06:36.826]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:06:59.136 --> 00:07:05.864]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Sunday, the 7th day of June 2015.
[00:07:05.864 --> 00:07:15.035]  This is an emergency report dealing not just with the Second Amendment, but with every basic human liberty that is now under open, naked attack.
[00:07:15.835 --> 00:07:19.358]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, this is a live radio broadcast.
[00:07:19.358 --> 00:07:29.625]  We're going to be throwing it in a moment to David Knight, who is live in studio in Austin, Texas, co-hosting with me the Sunday Syndicated Transmission.
[00:07:29.625 --> 00:07:42.634]  We'll also post this emergency alert to YouTube as well, and we're begging everyone out there to please go to InfoWars.com, click on the article, go to the NRA website and see this for yourself.
[00:07:43.514 --> 00:07:51.521]  Remember last year, Cody Wilson, fellow Austinite, developed a 3D printable gun.
[00:07:51.521 --> 00:07:54.504]  An AR-15.
[00:07:54.504 --> 00:08:04.192]  And the feds came after him and said, you can't put a file out, just digital information on how to build that, or we're going to indict you.
[00:08:04.192 --> 00:08:04.993]  And we warned then.
[00:08:05.825 --> 00:08:19.328]  That the Feds were going to claim that basically any type of written information about reloading, about how to fix any type of firearm, you name it, would be basically seen as the anarchist cookbook, and that information itself was terrorist.
[00:08:19.328 --> 00:08:21.809]  This is prior restraint.
[00:08:21.809 --> 00:08:33.292]  Well, now the NRA, who's very conservative and always very slow to act, has come out from their hill contacts, and Obama's promised a raft of executive powers, outside of law, to restrict the Second Amendment,
[00:08:34.102 --> 00:08:44.609]  They've now come out, stories on Infowars.com, and announced they're coming after the Second Amendment, not just with ammo restrictions, not just with the attempt that they've been announcing to ban some of the 5.56 ammo.
[00:08:46.972 --> 00:08:56.299]  But no, now they're saying they're going after the literature, everything, and that you'll have to get permission before you communicate about guns, period, on the internet.
[00:08:56.299 --> 00:09:10.589]  They've also announced in two different congressional hearings that they want to bring back the quote, Fairness Doctrine, kind of like the USA Freedom Act, it's a horrible name, it's very Orwellian, the Fairness Doctrine to not let people on talk radio or print actually say their political views.
[00:09:11.505 --> 00:09:12.645]  You're like, that'll never happen.
[00:09:12.645 --> 00:09:19.327]  Really until 1987, when Bruce Fine, head counsel of the FCC, got rid of it.
[00:09:19.327 --> 00:09:20.287]  Our guest Bruce Fine.
[00:09:20.287 --> 00:09:25.168]  Until that was done, talk radio didn't even exist.
[00:09:25.168 --> 00:09:26.229]  So we're going into this.
[00:09:26.229 --> 00:09:29.269]  The internet kill switch, the FCC takeover of the web.
[00:09:29.269 --> 00:09:32.770]  They've had Zuckerberg, Facebook meeting with the Communist Chinese in the U.S.
[00:09:32.770 --> 00:09:33.750]  on how to do this.
[00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:34.971]  It's in the TPP.
[00:09:34.971 --> 00:09:35.951]  That part's been leaked.
[00:09:38.169 --> 00:09:40.711]  The borders are open without any type of law.
[00:09:40.711 --> 00:09:43.153]  The power plants are being shut off outside of law.
[00:09:43.153 --> 00:09:44.535]  They're just power-grabbing.
[00:09:44.535 --> 00:09:48.598]  Michelle Obama tells our kids what to eat in schools outside of law.
[00:09:48.598 --> 00:09:51.981]  And if the schools don't follow it, they're fined outside of law.
[00:09:51.981 --> 00:09:53.883]  They just do whatever they want.
[00:09:53.883 --> 00:09:56.265]  Here's the article on InfoWars.com.
[00:09:56.265 --> 00:09:57.966]  Absolutely critically important.
[00:09:57.966 --> 00:10:03.932]  NRA, gun blogs, videos, web forums threatened by new Obama regulation.
[00:10:04.702 --> 00:10:12.669]  When you read the article by the Washington Examiner, it links to the NRA story at the NRA website.
[00:10:12.669 --> 00:10:19.856]  Breaking it down to the announcement, June 3rd, took us four or five days to find out about this, Federal Register.
[00:10:21.528 --> 00:10:24.731]  And that is where they are announcing it.
[00:10:24.731 --> 00:10:30.095]  So they just publish things in the Federal Register, they just do whatever they want in everyone's face.
[00:10:30.095 --> 00:10:38.361]  But notice, if you go to Infowars.com, or even mainstream media websites, it's the same story over and over again.
[00:10:38.361 --> 00:10:42.344]  Rand Paul demands White House release trade deal text immediately.
[00:10:42.344 --> 00:10:42.745]  See?
[00:10:42.745 --> 00:10:45.427]  Again, dictatorial, centralized power.
[00:10:45.427 --> 00:10:46.888]  Outside of law, just doing whatever they want.
[00:10:48.061 --> 00:10:50.824]  And thank God Rand Paul is saying, no, you must release it.
[00:10:50.824 --> 00:10:51.624]  I demand you do it.
[00:10:51.624 --> 00:10:53.126]  That's what a statesman would do.
[00:10:53.126 --> 00:10:55.668]  No one else even dares do that.
[00:10:55.668 --> 00:10:58.230]  Obama on his amnesty.
[00:10:58.230 --> 00:11:00.572]  The law is on our side.
[00:11:00.572 --> 00:11:03.955]  When he said he, quote, changed the law.
[00:11:03.955 --> 00:11:06.318]  No, Congress never passed the amnesty.
[00:11:06.318 --> 00:11:08.239]  He's done it by Executive Fiat.
[00:11:08.239 --> 00:11:12.603]  So it's more deception over and over and over again.
[00:11:12.603 --> 00:11:13.304]  Let's continue.
[00:11:14.657 --> 00:11:28.948]  Now, Joint Chiefs Chairman Dempsey says Putin intends to undermine Ukraine and NATO, when clearly, you can say what you want about Russian corruption, it's certainly there, the West is on their border, messing with them.
[00:11:28.948 --> 00:11:44.020]  So again, it's all part of this lawlessness, all part of this recklessness by the elite we have here, and Obama has previously promised at least 16 different initiatives to go after the Second Amendment.
[00:11:45.130 --> 00:11:50.211]  They're now saying they're just going to put anybody who's ever been to a psychologist basically and ever claimed insurance on it.
[00:11:50.211 --> 00:11:53.932]  They're going to claim you have a disability and restrict buying guns.
[00:11:53.932 --> 00:11:55.413]  Then they're going to make you turn them in.
[00:11:55.413 --> 00:12:01.154]  This is already being selectively tested in states like California and New York.
[00:12:01.154 --> 00:12:07.496]  So the establishment is making their move to sew up the United States and consolidate total control.
[00:12:07.496 --> 00:12:12.577]  If people don't get upset about this outrageous move
[00:12:13.764 --> 00:12:24.488]  That the Feds are now saying in a comment period, oh yeah, we're getting ready to, I mean if you go to Barnes and Noble, it's reloading magazines, designs of guns, how to fix them.
[00:12:24.488 --> 00:12:27.069]  They're saying, no, no, no, you can't have those.
[00:12:27.069 --> 00:12:33.812]  And I remember the old timers always saying, when they start going after gun manuals, when they start going after gun technicals, when they start trying to restrict that,
[00:12:34.352 --> 00:12:36.634]  Get ready, they're coming after the guns in general.
[00:12:36.634 --> 00:12:39.535]  They're trying to kill the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms.
[00:12:39.535 --> 00:12:43.718]  Culture, I'm going to throw it now live to David Knight in the studio.
[00:12:43.718 --> 00:12:50.602]  And I'm going to be back at the bottom of the hour with a very important message and information on the agenda of Bilderberg 2015.
[00:12:50.602 --> 00:12:55.325]  Then I'll be back at the end to get more into TPP.
[00:12:55.325 --> 00:12:56.926]  But all of this connects together.
[00:12:56.926 --> 00:13:03.310]  Centralized dictatorial power where arbitrary, tyrannical groups can do whatever they want, whenever they want.
[00:13:03.610 --> 00:13:09.452]  All right, we take you now to the Infowars.com news studios and David Knight.
[00:13:09.452 --> 00:13:18.436]  And that article that Alex was talking about on Infowars.com is the NRA says that gun blogs, videos, web forums are threatened by new Obama regulation.
[00:13:18.436 --> 00:13:24.438]  They say gunsmiths, manufacturers, reloaders, do-it-yourselfers could all find themselves muzzled.
[00:13:24.438 --> 00:13:25.799]  And here's the deal.
[00:13:25.799 --> 00:13:29.080]  This is all regulations being put out by the State Department.
[00:13:29.620 --> 00:13:32.862]  Regulations that would govern international arms sales, they say.
[00:13:32.862 --> 00:13:40.866]  So because this is something that's going across international lines, and because, of course, the Internet is international, they would come after the Internet.
[00:13:40.866 --> 00:13:48.710]  They say that any technical violations of this, people would face up to $1 million and 20 years in jail.
[00:13:48.710 --> 00:13:50.671]  That's how draconian these regulations are.
[00:13:51.371 --> 00:13:55.134]  Think about how they're coming after us just in this one area.
[00:13:55.134 --> 00:13:56.376]  Look at the U.N.
[00:13:56.376 --> 00:13:58.077]  Arms Trade Treaty.
[00:13:58.077 --> 00:14:00.639]  Look at the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
[00:14:00.639 --> 00:14:06.044]  These are all things that can be used to stifle, to control firearms.
[00:14:06.044 --> 00:14:14.732]  We also have the FCC and the State Department then coming after the Internet, after free speech, after technical information.
[00:14:14.732 --> 00:14:16.093]  Understand that the U.N.
[00:14:16.093 --> 00:14:17.635]  Arms Trade Treaty, they put that together
[00:14:18.255 --> 00:14:25.786]  It was admitted by the New York Times that Fast and Furious was a false flag attack designed to discredit the Second Amendment.
[00:14:25.786 --> 00:14:29.210]  And of course, what did Faults of Fast and Furious involve?
[00:14:29.210 --> 00:14:33.136]  It involved shipping arms across the border between the United States and Mexico.
[00:14:33.756 --> 00:14:38.059]  That was supposed to justify the UN Arms Trade Treaty for the American people.
[00:14:38.059 --> 00:14:39.781]  That was going to be their false flag.
[00:14:39.781 --> 00:14:47.366]  Instead, when a federal agent got killed in this and it blew up in their face, that was discredited.
[00:14:47.366 --> 00:14:49.848]  So they have tried to push this through in various ways.
[00:14:50.348 --> 00:14:58.271]  Many people believe that they will push it through, perhaps might be part of these trade partnerships, the Transatlantic, the Trans-Pacific partnerships.
[00:14:58.271 --> 00:15:08.834]  That might include restrictions on it that they would then use to say, well, since we have to track the flow of firearms across borders by treaty, that means we have to get all this
[00:15:09.634 --> 00:15:12.977]  Information about you, about your firearms.
[00:15:12.977 --> 00:15:17.461]  We have to create this database so that we can do our work and enforce this treaty.
[00:15:17.461 --> 00:15:20.263]  That's the rationale that they would use for that.
[00:15:20.263 --> 00:15:25.647]  Now, of course, if this isn't in the Trans-Pacific or Trans-Atlantic partnerships, understand
[00:15:26.408 --> 00:15:30.050]  That it can be added after these things have been passed.
[00:15:30.050 --> 00:15:48.742]  That's one of the things that's so outrageous about these partnership agreements is that we cannot only not see it before it's passed, that the elected representatives of ours cannot modify it or amend it, but that it will be easily amended without any input from the Congress after it is passed.
[00:15:48.742 --> 00:15:51.484]  We have to pass it so that they can change it.
[00:15:51.684 --> 00:15:52.806]  Stay with us, we're going to be right back.
[00:15:52.806 --> 00:15:58.939]  We're going to talk about Bilderberg as the root of these Trans-Pacific, Trans-Atlantic partnerships.
[00:16:00.055 --> 00:16:05.218]  Alex Jones here with Infowarslife.com Consumer Alert Report.
[00:16:05.218 --> 00:16:12.541]  Many of you are aware that around the world most populations are woefully deficient in clean forms of iodine.
[00:16:12.541 --> 00:16:20.625]  The good news is our listeners over the past two years tried X2 nascent iodine and experienced it for themselves.
[00:16:20.625 --> 00:16:21.626]  The bad news is
[00:16:21.966 --> 00:16:29.630]  For the first time in more than a year, supplies at InfoWarsLife.com of Survival Shield X2 Nascent Iodine are running low.

[00:16:59.847 --> 00:17:16.517]  Ladies and gentlemen, you haven't really ever heard firearms manufacturers as sponsors on my syndicated radio show or the nightly news or the news website InfoWars.com because the companies I've been approached by were not the highest quality and they weren't as affordable as they should be, so I refused.
[00:17:16.517 --> 00:17:20.019]  Probably 30, 40 firearms manufacturers over the years will then
[00:17:20.359 --> 00:17:24.424]  About six months ago, we get contacted by Head Down Firearms.
[00:17:24.424 --> 00:17:25.946]  Hdfirearms.com.

[00:20:02.469 --> 00:20:12.572]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:12.572 --> 00:20:20.274]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:20:27.054 --> 00:20:28.396]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:28.396 --> 00:20:29.137]  I'm David Knight.
[00:20:29.137 --> 00:20:30.959]  I'm co-hosting today with Alex Jones.
[00:20:30.959 --> 00:20:43.575]  In the last segment, he was talking about the new firearms regulations that the NRA has pointed out the State Department is trying to make law that would essentially restrict not only the Second Amendment, but also the First Amendment.
[00:20:44.176 --> 00:20:47.159]  Putting in penalties up to 20 years in prison.
[00:20:47.159 --> 00:20:53.544]  One million dollar fines because you publish technical details about firearms or other things.
[00:20:53.544 --> 00:21:06.215]  In the past what they have done is they gave an exclusion to things that were in the public domain and so it begs the question as to how they are going to define that and it's a very complicated discussion there but the NRA is concerned about it.
[00:21:06.215 --> 00:21:07.396]  We should all be concerned about this.
[00:21:07.936 --> 00:21:23.062]  We have seen multiple ways that this administration, and of course the one before it, is coming after the internet freedoms that we enjoy, as well as our international sovereignty is now on the line, just as we saw with the
[00:21:24.022 --> 00:21:25.943]  Implementation of NAFTA.
[00:21:25.943 --> 00:21:29.586]  It was very important for them to get that done under a Democrat president.
[00:21:29.586 --> 00:21:31.427]  They got it done under Clinton.
[00:21:31.427 --> 00:21:48.339]  It's very important for them to get this done under Obama, because so many people who will just march in lockstep behind that, the camp followers of the Democratic Party, who might be concerned about this, because on the surface it looks like, and this is the way they're selling it on the surface, to get it
[00:21:48.979 --> 00:21:50.260]  to pass
[00:22:08.069 --> 00:22:08.529]  I don't
[00:22:27.589 --> 00:22:31.651]  Who are traveling now on their way to Bilderberg coming up this next week.
[00:22:31.651 --> 00:22:39.856]  We have Paul Joseph Watson, Rob Dew, Josh Owens are all going to be in Austria this next week covering the Bilderberg group.
[00:22:39.856 --> 00:22:43.778]  Something that for many decades they pretended did not even exist.
[00:22:43.778 --> 00:22:45.319]  Well into the 90s.
[00:22:45.319 --> 00:22:49.961]  If you talked about Bilderberg you were laughed at as being a conspiracy theorist.
[00:22:49.961 --> 00:22:52.923]  We now know that Bilderberg, going back to
[00:22:54.190 --> 00:22:55.472]  It's very beginning.
[00:22:55.472 --> 00:23:02.961]  The very first few meetings they were working on creating a European Union and a Euro currency.
[00:23:02.961 --> 00:23:10.111]  That's the way they move to global governance is through this gradual process that is going on there.
[00:23:10.111 --> 00:23:12.454]  Now we're in the later stages of consolidation.
[00:23:12.994 --> 00:23:15.636]  Some of these organizations have been exposed.
[00:23:15.636 --> 00:23:26.864]  We're going to be following who is showing up at the Bilderberg Conference, but of course right now in Austria, not too far from where the Bilderberg Conference is going to be held, they have the G7 meetings going on.
[00:23:26.864 --> 00:23:32.768]  And the people that are there are very concerned about the Transatlantic Partnership, the TTIP.
[00:23:34.116 --> 00:23:46.961]  The protesters at the G7 Summit in Garmisch, Austria, in Bavaria, are upset about what they see as being a sellout, rightfully so, a sellout of sovereignty.
[00:23:46.961 --> 00:23:47.581]  Here's some of the quotes.
[00:23:47.581 --> 00:23:50.562]  This is a story on The Guardian by Charlie Skelton, of course.
[00:23:51.362 --> 00:23:54.184]  He is the one who covers Bilderberg for the Guardian.
[00:23:54.184 --> 00:23:56.666]  We saw him there last year in Copenhagen.
[00:23:56.666 --> 00:23:57.967]  A very good writer.
[00:23:57.967 --> 00:23:58.748]  This is what he says.
[00:23:58.748 --> 00:24:08.074]  He says, a helicopter came and hovered directly over us for about five minutes, presumably because they thought someone on the march had brought along a thermonuclear device.
[00:24:08.074 --> 00:24:11.457]  He says, they're talking about this being the largest police operation
[00:24:11.977 --> 00:24:13.718]  In the history of Bavaria.
[00:24:13.718 --> 00:24:15.099]  He said it was too loud to speak.
[00:24:15.099 --> 00:24:18.061]  He said there were so many helicopters hovering over us right now.
[00:24:18.061 --> 00:24:22.984]  He says, I keep expecting to hear Riot of the Valkyries referring to Apocalypse Now.
[00:24:22.984 --> 00:24:25.166]  I don't know exactly what they're all doing up there.
[00:24:25.166 --> 00:24:27.707]  I hope they're trying to avoid each other.
[00:24:27.707 --> 00:24:34.352]  And then he quotes a journalist from Der Spiegel, says that it is the largest police operation in the history of Bavaria.
[00:24:34.352 --> 00:24:40.396]  And he goes on to say, such a huge display of power like this, I'm afraid people feel that it's a provocation.
[00:24:40.976 --> 00:24:41.716]  Precisely.
[00:24:41.716 --> 00:24:45.058]  That's exactly what it is when they put up a massive police presence.
[00:24:45.058 --> 00:24:54.042]  If you look at that picture on there, if you pull that picture up for the article, you can see a few protesters flanked by an army of cops escorting them as they're marching.
[00:24:54.042 --> 00:24:56.383]  And so, Skelton goes on and says, it feels a bit weird.
[00:24:56.963 --> 00:25:01.007]  There could not actually be any more police in Garmisch than there are right now.
[00:25:01.007 --> 00:25:02.288]  There wouldn't be room.
[00:25:02.288 --> 00:25:04.550]  He says there's traffic jams of police vehicles.
[00:25:04.550 --> 00:25:10.675]  Every spare inch of tarmac has been commandeered for police coaches, riot vans, operations trucks.
[00:25:10.675 --> 00:25:15.420]  The only cars on the road that aren't police cars are being driven by Plains Cove policemen.
[00:25:15.740 --> 00:25:18.262]  And he goes on to say, it's a show of political power.
[00:25:18.262 --> 00:25:20.564]  This is a 16-year-old student who is wide awake.
[00:25:20.564 --> 00:25:26.489]  He said, this is a show of political power, but it is also a suppression of political protest.
[00:25:26.489 --> 00:25:33.355]  People have been stopped at checkpoints for so long, for hours at a time, that it's really difficult simply to show up here.
[00:25:33.355 --> 00:25:37.918]  But that's all that we can do in this situation is to show up.
[00:25:37.918 --> 00:25:40.260]  Essentially, that's what Bilderberg is about.
[00:25:40.260 --> 00:25:41.721]  We can't get into the meetings.
[00:25:41.721 --> 00:25:42.222]  They hide it.
[00:25:42.222 --> 00:25:43.963]  They keep it in secret, just like they do the G7.
[00:25:45.541 --> 00:25:55.048]  Unlike the G7, where you've got heads of state meeting, we have heads of state, we have corporations meeting, we have intelligence agencies meeting, and build a murk like they have for decades.
[00:25:55.048 --> 00:25:58.550]  And of course, we're not allowed to see what happens there.
[00:25:58.550 --> 00:26:02.133]  The best we can do is try to ascertain who is there.
[00:26:02.133 --> 00:26:05.836]  In the last year or so, they have published an agenda, but we don't know if that's true.
[00:26:05.836 --> 00:26:07.077]  We have no way to verify that.
[00:26:07.077 --> 00:26:08.417]  We just have to take their word for it.
[00:26:09.398 --> 00:26:14.445]  But then, Skelton goes on to ask in his article, he says, but what made this 16-year-old show up today?
[00:26:14.445 --> 00:26:19.933]  And the 16-year-old said, it's the TTIP, that's the European version, the Transatlantic Partnership.
[00:26:20.692 --> 00:26:26.075]  He says, this was the word that was on everyone's lips, everyone's placards, both young and old.
[00:26:26.075 --> 00:26:32.839]  The hikers were from across the political spectrum, from anarcho-syndicalists and libertarians through the greens to the communists.
[00:26:32.839 --> 00:26:37.242]  But everybody was concerned about the TTIP trade deal.
[00:26:37.242 --> 00:26:42.025]  It seemed to be the one issue that gave focus to this vast ideological sprawl.
[00:26:42.685 --> 00:26:53.511]  And so then he talked to a guy now, first he talks to a 16-year-old, then he talks to a 61-year-old, and he says, the 61-year-old says, they are global companies with global power.
[00:26:53.511 --> 00:26:57.053]  But today we're told over and over again that globalism is good.
[00:26:57.053 --> 00:26:58.774]  Yeah, it's good for a few.
[00:26:58.774 --> 00:27:01.775]  Yes, it is very good for those very few, he chuckled.
[00:27:01.775 --> 00:27:09.640]  To call yourself a globalist, you would have to be either very stupid or very, very rich.
[00:27:09.640 --> 00:27:11.941]  Or perhaps you'd have to be very apathetic.
[00:27:13.254 --> 00:27:29.004]  You know, as we look at some of the stories that came up towards the end of the week last week, and we'll talk about this a little bit more, when I look at what happened with the Gaia Democratic School, where they took some very young children to a pornography shop on a field trip.
[00:27:30.287 --> 00:27:32.829]  It reminded me of Brave New World.
[00:27:32.829 --> 00:27:46.981]  And I think the real key that we see here, certainly in this particular case that's going on with the G7 right now, I think the vast majority of the population is subdued by a kind of Brave New World approach.
[00:27:46.981 --> 00:27:51.625]  Something that comes at them and essentially celebrates promiscuity.
[00:27:52.714 --> 00:27:54.815]  Makes a virtue of it.
[00:27:54.815 --> 00:27:56.716]  That distracts people.
[00:27:56.716 --> 00:28:01.339]  That says, you can have all the sex that you want, but you can't have a family.
[00:28:01.339 --> 00:28:03.360]  We don't want parents.
[00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:05.882]  And that's the society that we're moving to.
[00:28:05.882 --> 00:28:07.543]  It's not something that started with Brave New World.
[00:28:07.543 --> 00:28:10.365]  Of course, it goes back all the way to Plato's Republic.
[00:28:10.365 --> 00:28:13.767]  That was the formula that he had for control.
[00:28:13.767 --> 00:28:22.072]  But I think that the vast majority of the public is distracted by this pleasure, by the drugs, by the sex that we are offered.
[00:28:23.399 --> 00:28:24.600]  And so they're not paying attention.
[00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:38.726]  The few people who do pay attention, like this 16-year-old, like the 61-year-old, who understand exactly what's going on with this Trans-Pacific Partnership, those who understand, who show up, what do they get?
[00:28:38.726 --> 00:28:41.427]  They get the 1984 treatment.
[00:28:41.427 --> 00:28:42.928]  And so our government has to
[00:28:44.248 --> 00:28:45.911]  Exercise 1984.
[00:28:45.911 --> 00:28:52.839]  Surveillance on all of us to determine who's going to get the fist, the iron fist, the boot stomping in their face.
[00:28:52.839 --> 00:28:53.300]  Stay with us.
[00:28:53.300 --> 00:28:56.144]  When we come right back, Alex Jones is going to break down Bilderberg for you.
[00:28:56.144 --> 00:28:56.885]  We'll be right back.
[00:28:59.935 --> 00:29:16.595]  Ladies and gentlemen, you haven't really ever heard firearms manufacturers as sponsors on my syndicated radio show, or the nightly news, or the news website, InfoWars.com, because the companies I've been approached by were not the highest quality, and they weren't as affordable as they should be, so I refused.
[00:29:16.595 --> 00:29:20.099]  Probably 30, 40 firearms manufacturers over the years will then
[00:29:20.439 --> 00:29:24.480]  About six months ago, we get contacted by Head Down Firearms.
[00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:26.021]  Hdfirearms.com.
[00:29:26.021 --> 00:29:29.342]  Owned and run by a bunch of former Navy SEALs and Special Ops people.
[00:29:29.342 --> 00:29:34.484]  They're veterans, they're patriots, they're listeners of the radio show, and they want to support the broadcast.
[00:29:34.484 --> 00:29:35.384]  It's always about security.
[00:29:35.444 --> 00:29:35.704]  I think so.
[00:29:59.805 --> 00:30:04.970]  Introducing Secret 12, the new InfoWars Life vitamin B12 formulation.
[00:30:04.970 --> 00:30:11.076]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimedical grade bioavailable coenzyme forms of B12.
[00:30:11.076 --> 00:30:15.861]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections, and adenosylcobalamin.
[00:30:15.861 --> 00:30:19.444]  Secret 12 is simply taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.
[00:30:19.444 --> 00:30:21.006]  No needles, no injections.

[00:30:26.811 --> 00:30:28.273]  Alex Jones here.
[00:30:28.273 --> 00:30:39.644]  For the last two years, I've been working with top doctors, nutritionists, and chemists to design a nutraceutical formulation that has truly life-changing health benefits.
[00:30:39.904 --> 00:30:43.726]  Introducing the all-new Ancient Defense Herbal Immunity Blend.
[00:30:43.726 --> 00:30:52.049]  Experience the benefits of combining over 14 ancient herbs and extracts with exciting new advances in nutraceutical science.

[00:30:54.350 --> 00:30:55.390]  That's Infowarslife.com.
[00:30:59.437 --> 00:31:00.378]  Hey, how you doing, Al?
[00:31:00.378 --> 00:31:00.938]  Good, brother.
[00:31:00.938 --> 00:31:02.899]  Just recently started using your products.
[00:31:02.899 --> 00:31:04.600]  Everything you said about them is correct.
[00:31:04.600 --> 00:31:08.722]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them, and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[00:31:08.722 --> 00:31:11.264]  Well, thank you, brother, because it also funds our operation.
[00:31:11.264 --> 00:31:13.685]  But doing that, I know I've got to have the highest quality.
[00:31:13.685 --> 00:31:21.530]  Super Mill Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[00:31:21.850 --> 00:31:25.091]  We do the super male and the super female vitality.
[00:31:25.091 --> 00:31:26.632]  Big changes, a lot of energy.
[00:31:26.632 --> 00:31:29.533]  We've gotten off of the cheap energy drinks, energy shots.
[00:31:29.533 --> 00:31:31.294]  Saving a ton of money there.
[00:31:31.294 --> 00:31:33.775]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs.
[00:31:35.097 --> 00:31:36.437]  We're good to go.
[00:31:59.426 --> 00:32:04.589]  Alex Jones here with an InfoWarsLife.com Consumer Alert Report.
[00:32:04.589 --> 00:32:11.914]  Many of you are aware that around the world most populations are woefully deficient in clean forms of iodine.
[00:32:11.914 --> 00:32:19.999]  The good news is our listeners over the past two years tried X2 nascent iodine and experienced it for themselves.
[00:32:19.999 --> 00:32:21.000]  The bad news is
[00:32:21.320 --> 00:32:29.007]  For the first time in more than a year, supplies at Infowarslife.com of Survival Shield X2 Nascent Iodine are running low.
[00:32:29.007 --> 00:32:33.791]  But what's even more serious is the supply of these Deep Earth Crystals.
[00:32:33.791 --> 00:32:41.178]  That exclusive 999 pure source is proprietary and only available at Infowarslife.com.
[00:32:41.178 --> 00:32:44.061]  And that supply is running low and is in question.
[00:32:44.281 --> 00:32:51.263]  That's why it's more important than ever to secure your current and longtime supply of Survival Shield Nascent Iodine X2 today.
[00:32:51.263 --> 00:32:55.524]  Available exclusively at Infowarslife.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[00:32:55.524 --> 00:32:58.064]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:33:17.364 --> 00:33:23.387]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here with a special announcement for all InfoWars.com viewers and readers.
[00:33:43.325 --> 00:33:50.871]  Bilderberg 2015 is going to be one of the most important Bilderberg events that's ever been covered by the press.
[00:33:50.871 --> 00:34:00.379]  It is the Bilderberg group that represents the global corporate fascist shadow government that is establishing a planetary regime right now.
[00:34:00.379 --> 00:34:03.322]  They're behind the EU in their own annals.
[00:34:03.322 --> 00:34:07.165]  They're behind the North American Union and now the Asian Union known as the TPP.
[00:34:08.809 --> 00:34:10.270]  They don't want to be identified.
[00:34:10.270 --> 00:34:11.610]  They don't want press coverage.
[00:34:11.610 --> 00:34:15.491]  Until 10 years ago, the media wouldn't even admit they existed.
[00:34:15.491 --> 00:34:21.954]  But alternative media, the people's media, you, the viewers of this show and others, helped expose it.
[00:34:21.954 --> 00:34:23.314]  It's so exciting.
[00:34:23.314 --> 00:34:25.315]  And now there's a real debate about TPP.
[00:34:26.454 --> 00:34:31.457]  Now there is a real debate about these shadow groups and organizations.
[00:34:31.457 --> 00:34:45.425]  Now people are saying, what do you mean there's global treaties that are secret that curtail the internet freedom and have global carbon taxes and erase national sovereignty and set laws for our Congress and parliaments?
[00:34:46.704 --> 00:34:55.319]  That's why they always denied corporate global government, because the minute it's exposed, and the minute we begin to discuss it, it begins to implode.
[00:34:55.319 --> 00:34:57.443]  In fact, look at two articles that just came out.
[00:34:58.291 --> 00:35:16.829]  In the BBC and Associated Press, there's hundreds of others, where the UKIP party, that's basically a Ron Paul, Patriot, Alex Jones party in Europe and England, with Lord Monckton and Nigel Farage, has forced the Tory party to say we're going to move to get out of the EU if they don't let the UK make its own laws.
[00:35:16.829 --> 00:35:21.794]  England never got to vote, the UK never got to vote, to be part of the Euro.
[00:35:22.495 --> 00:35:26.941]  They just called it a trade deal like the TPP, like NAFTA, like GATT.
[00:35:26.941 --> 00:35:28.843]  So these are very exciting developments.
[00:35:28.843 --> 00:35:30.785]  Bilderberg doesn't want to be covered.
[00:35:30.785 --> 00:35:34.810]  Normally they only shut the hotel down a day before when they have it in different parts of the world.
[00:35:34.810 --> 00:35:36.673]  This time it shut down a whole week before.
[00:35:37.580 --> 00:35:45.346]  And Rob Dew, Paul Watson, Josh Owens, they're all going to be there Sunday through the Sunday afterwards.
[00:35:45.346 --> 00:35:52.070]  Coming up from the 8th, that Monday, right through Bilderberg, covering it live on the ground for us.
[00:35:52.070 --> 00:35:59.415]  The police and military and others are shaking people down, grabbing their IDs, they're already harassing hikers and skiers.
[00:35:59.415 --> 00:36:02.498]  This is already going on because the Bilderberg group is scared.
[00:36:03.198 --> 00:36:15.121]  Royalty, world leaders, Rothschilds, Rockefellers, the heads of Google, Microsoft, the Defense Department, Prime Ministers, they're all going to be there with Henry Kissinger and others.
[00:36:15.121 --> 00:36:18.181]  And they just hope we all go to sleep and not know what they were doing.
[00:36:18.181 --> 00:36:29.764]  We're going to be there exposing it and pointing out that this is exactly the very type of organization and group that is staying in the shadows so they can engineer things like the TPP.
[00:36:30.524 --> 00:36:32.225]  Are there other globalist organizations?
[00:36:32.225 --> 00:36:40.870]  Yes, but they're all chaired and run by the very same 150 Bilderberg Group members and their guests.
[00:36:41.883 --> 00:36:54.428]  And so we're focusing in on what the dinosaur corporate media hopes you won't look at, hopes you won't investigate, because sunshine will destroy these political vampires.
[00:36:54.428 --> 00:36:59.951]  So join us at InfoWars.com forward slash show, where the radio show,
[00:37:00.945 --> 00:37:03.966]  And TV show weekdays is free streaming.
[00:37:03.966 --> 00:37:10.887]  Also, we're going to have the nightly news free, not just for subscribers, all next week for seven days straight.
[00:37:10.887 --> 00:37:13.047]  We'll also have reporting on Saturday.
[00:37:13.047 --> 00:37:16.968]  It starts the 8th and it runs right through for seven days.
[00:37:16.968 --> 00:37:20.389]  We'll see if they try to stop our reporters even getting into Austria.
[00:37:20.389 --> 00:37:22.209]  That's happened before in England.
[00:37:22.209 --> 00:37:24.329]  It's happened in Canada.
[00:37:24.329 --> 00:37:28.110]  Reporters have been shot at in places like Lisbon, Portugal.
[00:37:28.630 --> 00:37:30.071]  I mean, this is a big deal.
[00:37:30.071 --> 00:37:31.552]  This is Spectre.
[00:37:31.552 --> 00:37:32.692]  This is Hydra.
[00:37:32.692 --> 00:37:40.097]  These are the bad guys that are behind the derivatives, the central banks, the wars, the funding of ISIS.
[00:37:40.097 --> 00:37:42.698]  These crooks do not want you watching.
[00:37:42.698 --> 00:37:51.103]  So, get the free link at InfoWars.com forward slash show that we'll put below us here on this video and story, and send it out to friends and family.
[00:37:51.103 --> 00:37:52.464]  Post it on Facebook.
[00:37:52.464 --> 00:37:53.325]  Send it out on Twitter.
[00:37:54.285 --> 00:38:02.350]  Sign off on your emails with it and be part of the info war because you the viewers don't stand in front of us or beside us or behind us.
[00:38:02.350 --> 00:38:05.692]  You stand at the heart of the human awakening worldwide.
[00:38:05.692 --> 00:38:14.617]  Whether you be black, white, old, young, from Germany, from China, from Mexico, from Canada, from the United States, from Austria, from South Africa, or from Libya.
[00:38:14.617 --> 00:38:16.038]  It doesn't matter.
[00:38:16.038 --> 00:38:17.659]  Humans want freedom.
[00:38:17.659 --> 00:38:22.722]  We want a level playing field and we're exposing the global corporate robber baron king.
[00:38:22.722 --> 00:38:23.063]  We're good.
[00:38:37.418 --> 00:38:42.041]  We have to look at who is pulling the strings, who's orchestrating it, and who's controlling it.
[00:38:42.041 --> 00:38:46.504]  Alright, well, that's it for this special emergency transmission.
[00:38:46.504 --> 00:38:48.105]  You are the modern Paul Reveres.
[00:38:48.105 --> 00:38:53.369]  Get this information out to everybody you know, and we are literally going to see the fall of Bilderberg.
[00:38:53.689 --> 00:38:58.933]  The fall of the EU, the fall of this global tyranny, right as they try to launch it off the ground.
[00:38:58.933 --> 00:39:09.201]  Because this is the point where the tyranny emerges when the world government has announced, after all the denial, they're trying to bring down freedom, shut down web freedom right now.
[00:39:09.201 --> 00:39:10.862]  Now is the time to expose them.
[00:39:10.862 --> 00:39:14.085]  They're at their weakest right as they spread their wings.
[00:39:14.085 --> 00:39:19.469]  I'm Alex Jones signing off, and never forget, if you're watching this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:39:20.401 --> 00:39:27.090]  All right, and as Alex Jones just pointed out, we're going to be sending reporters Paul Joseph Watson, Rob Due, and Josh Owens to Bilderberg.
[00:39:27.090 --> 00:39:27.831]  They're on their way right now.
[00:39:27.831 --> 00:39:34.700]  We're going to have a report, an update from Rob Due in the next segment, giving us an update at the airport, how things are going, because we
[00:39:35.401 --> 00:39:41.065]  Typically run into a lot of just maybe coincidental travel problems when we go to Bilderberg, it seems like.
[00:39:41.065 --> 00:39:48.450]  We had more than our share of them last year with things being cancelled on us, car reservations and so forth.
[00:39:48.450 --> 00:39:49.731]  Very strange.
[00:39:49.731 --> 00:39:52.633]  But anyway, we're going to have a report from Rob Dew at the airport.
[00:39:52.633 --> 00:39:53.694]  Support us this next week.
[00:39:53.874 --> 00:39:58.496]  We're going to be, as Alex Jones pointed out, broadcasting the Nightly News live.
[00:39:58.496 --> 00:40:00.737]  That's normally a subscription service.
[00:40:00.737 --> 00:40:03.097]  We do make it available the day after on YouTube.
[00:40:03.097 --> 00:40:04.758]  You can see it with YouTube subscriptions.
[00:40:04.758 --> 00:40:11.721]  But if you subscribe to Prison Planet and support us with your paid subscription there, that's something you can share with 20 people.
[00:40:12.601 --> 00:40:13.281]  We're good to go.
[00:40:34.989 --> 00:40:43.278]  Now, of course, with everything that's going on, you need a few drops of this just to get a powerful dose of a key essential nutrient, iodine.
[00:40:43.278 --> 00:40:47.342]  And, of course, it's in one of the best forms you can find the iodine, nascent iodine.
[00:40:47.342 --> 00:40:51.207]  And our X2 iodine comes from thousands of feet within the Earth.
[00:40:51.727 --> 00:40:55.488]  We run radiation tests before we even accept the pure raw iodine.
[00:40:55.488 --> 00:41:02.830]  It's now time to get prepared to have something in your medicine closet for yourself as well as for your everyday health as a supplement.
[00:41:02.830 --> 00:41:05.831]  Survival Shield X2 from InfoWars Life.
[00:41:05.831 --> 00:41:07.032]  I take it every day.
[00:41:07.032 --> 00:41:08.572]  My family takes it every day.
[00:41:08.572 --> 00:41:11.013]  Secure yours at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:41:12.133 --> 00:41:20.699]  Now, as Alex was pointing out with Bilderberg, we're going to take a look, as I said in the next segment, we're going to have an update from Rob Dew as to the travel arrangements, as to what's going on with them.
[00:41:20.699 --> 00:41:25.742]  But I want to take a look also at the origin and the history of Bilderberg.
[00:41:25.742 --> 00:41:31.026]  You know, last year marked the 60th anniversary of the first meeting of the Bilderberg Group.
[00:41:31.026 --> 00:41:38.351]  This year marks the 60th anniversary of their plans to create the European Union and the Euro currency.
[00:41:39.091 --> 00:41:39.852]  That's very important.
[00:41:39.852 --> 00:41:52.060]  If we go back and look at an article that came out in 2009 from Paul Joseph Watson, leaked 1955 Bilderberg docs outline a plan for a single European currency.
[00:41:52.060 --> 00:41:59.525]  And he points out the global elite spoke of the agenda to create the euro nearly 40 years before it was first codified in the 1992 Maastricht Treaty.
[00:42:01.286 --> 00:42:04.970]  Now the interesting thing is they are calling it a European Union.
[00:42:04.970 --> 00:42:06.691]  They are calling it a treaty.
[00:42:06.691 --> 00:42:13.638]  We have achieved essentially a North American Union through a North American Free Trade Agreement.
[00:42:13.638 --> 00:42:17.602]  They always like to make it a little bit more subversive for us.
[00:42:17.602 --> 00:42:18.964]  I guess the Europeans are
[00:42:19.938 --> 00:42:29.802]  Not quite as suspicious, but we do have a lot of people in America that are dumbed down enough, I guess, that they wouldn't understand the difference between a union and a trade treaty.
[00:42:29.802 --> 00:42:36.665]  But going back and looking at the history of this, it's very interesting to see how they brought this in gradually.
[00:42:37.085 --> 00:42:42.929]  And of course, as Alex pointed out, the same people that head the Bilderberg head all these other different groups like the Trilateral Commission.
[00:42:42.929 --> 00:42:49.313]  We're going to talk about Zbigniew Brzezinski and how he outlined how they would move gradually to global governance when we come back.
[00:42:49.313 --> 00:42:49.753]  Stay with us.
[00:42:49.753 --> 00:42:50.314]  We'll be right back.
[00:42:59.907 --> 00:43:05.049]  Introducing Secret 12, the new InfoWars Life vitamin B12 formulation.
[00:43:05.049 --> 00:43:11.171]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimedical grade bioavailable coenzyme forms of B12.
[00:43:11.171 --> 00:43:15.952]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections, and adenosylcobalamin.
[00:43:15.952 --> 00:43:19.533]  Secret 12 is simply taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.
[00:43:19.533 --> 00:43:21.094]  No needles, no injections.

[00:43:40.020 --> 00:43:43.842]  Introducing the all-new Ancient Defense Herbal Immunity Blend.

[00:43:59.423 --> 00:44:19.183]  Ladies and gentlemen, you haven't really ever heard firearms manufacturers as sponsors on my syndicated radio show, or the nightly news, or the news website, InfoWars.com, because the companies I've been approached by were not the highest quality, and they weren't as affordable as they should be, so I refused probably 30, 40 firearms manufacturers over the years.
[00:44:19.183 --> 00:44:19.604]  Well then,
[00:44:19.924 --> 00:44:23.988]  About six months ago, we get contacted by Head Down Firearms.
[00:44:23.988 --> 00:44:25.529]  Hdfirearms.com.
[00:44:25.529 --> 00:44:28.852]  Owned and run by a bunch of former Navy SEALs and Special Ops people.
[00:44:28.852 --> 00:44:33.977]  They're veterans, they're patriots, they're listeners of the radio show, and they want to support the broadcast.
[00:44:33.977 --> 00:44:34.838]  It's always about security.
[00:44:34.938 --> 00:44:35.338]  I think so.
[00:44:59.406 --> 00:45:00.667]  Another major health threat.
[00:45:00.667 --> 00:45:05.629]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[00:45:05.629 --> 00:45:08.310]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[00:45:08.310 --> 00:45:15.353]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[00:45:15.353 --> 00:45:18.354]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[00:45:18.354 --> 00:45:21.295]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[00:45:21.295 --> 00:45:23.316]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[00:45:23.316 --> 00:45:26.117]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[00:45:26.237 --> 00:45:31.964]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[00:45:31.964 --> 00:45:35.468]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[00:45:35.468 --> 00:45:38.572]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[00:45:38.572 --> 00:45:42.837]  The ProPure Pro1 G2.0 water filtration system is a must-have.

[00:45:59.153 --> 00:46:06.357]  For all of recorded history, civilizations around the world praised the health benefits of silver.

[00:46:21.766 --> 00:46:23.407]  Toxic artificial additives.

[00:46:48.730 --> 00:46:50.551]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:47:18.484 --> 00:47:24.668]  It's always a tough vote because the average person thinks raising the debt ceiling must mean that we're running up our debt.
[00:47:24.668 --> 00:47:30.431]  Raising the debt ceiling, which has been done over a hundred times, does not increase our debt.
[00:47:30.431 --> 00:47:33.793]  It does not somehow promote profligacy.
[00:47:33.793 --> 00:47:37.656]  All it does is it says, you've got to pay the bills that you've already racked up, Congress.
[00:47:37.656 --> 00:47:41.858]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:51.368 --> 00:47:52.769]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:52.769 --> 00:47:54.070]  I'm David Knight in studio.
[00:47:54.070 --> 00:47:58.093]  We've had Alex Jones popping in and co-hosting with me today.
[00:47:58.093 --> 00:48:03.557]  He also has a report that we're going to get to about the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the TPP.
[00:48:03.557 --> 00:48:04.458]  What's going on with that?
[00:48:05.254 --> 00:48:11.881]  Of course, a lot of people are starting to wake up and understand that we shouldn't have government conducted in secret.
[00:48:11.881 --> 00:48:18.528]  And that's precisely the fundamental issue about these so-called partnerships that are being negotiated right now.
[00:48:18.528 --> 00:48:19.689]  It's a total outrage.
[00:48:19.689 --> 00:48:22.452]  But this has been going on for a very long time.
[00:48:22.452 --> 00:48:25.915]  It's been going on for decades with groups like the Bilderberg Group.
[00:48:26.576 --> 00:48:42.867]  That's precisely the core problem with the Bilderberg Group, that they could meet secretly between government and corporations and the military and the intelligence services, that they could have these private meetings where we now know, looking at some of the documents that have come out, that they planned
[00:48:43.847 --> 00:48:48.871]  The European Union, the euro single currency, many other things that have come out.
[00:48:48.871 --> 00:48:56.836]  We understand that these are things have been crafted together in secret by corporations working with government, the largest corporations working with government.
[00:48:56.836 --> 00:48:58.797]  It's no longer a conspiracy theory.
[00:48:58.797 --> 00:49:06.022]  It's pretty obvious what's going on now because we are in the final stages of what they've been working on for many, many decades.
[00:49:06.022 --> 00:49:08.523]  Of course, the first Bilderberg meeting was 61 years ago.
[00:49:10.285 --> 00:49:14.669]  Sixty years ago, they created the plan for the European Union and the Euro.
[00:49:14.669 --> 00:49:20.575]  Now, on the way to cover Bilderberg, we have Rob Dew and Josh Owens are headed out.
[00:49:20.575 --> 00:49:30.765]  He just filed a report about their trip at the airport, talking to people, see if they understand, even now, what's going on with the Bilderberg Group.
[00:49:30.765 --> 00:49:31.526]  Here's that report.
[00:49:34.483 --> 00:49:36.604]  Rob Dew reporting for InfoWars.com.
[00:49:36.604 --> 00:49:38.465]  We are in O'Hare International Airport.
[00:49:38.465 --> 00:49:42.667]  We have about a three-hour layover before we get on the flight going to Austria.
[00:49:42.667 --> 00:49:48.570]  We're actually going to make a stop in Frankfurt, Germany and then head into Austria, but covering this year's Bilderberg.
[00:49:48.570 --> 00:49:53.452]  So while we were here at three hours, had some time to think, I got to read a few articles.
[00:49:53.452 --> 00:50:01.716]  There's one written by, or I guess co-written by, Christine Jimenez, and she's talking about one of the people who will be coming to this year's Bilderberg, a
[00:50:02.616 --> 00:50:07.621]  Eduardo Barrasso, who is the Prime Minister of Portugal, who's also head of the Steering Committee.
[00:50:07.621 --> 00:50:13.027]  Interestingly enough, he was invited to a couple of Bilderberg meetings before he became Prime Minister.
[00:50:13.027 --> 00:50:17.551]  So that's a theme we see a lot of these elites getting invited to these things.
[00:50:17.551 --> 00:50:20.414]  They kind of get sniffed out to see if they're going to do what they're told.
[00:50:20.414 --> 00:50:22.316]  And then they get high positionships.
[00:50:22.316 --> 00:50:25.699]  He's also on the Steering Committee of Bilderberg, and he was Prime Minister of Portugal.
[00:50:27.147 --> 00:50:33.972]  Another thing that is really interesting is Alex is talking about how we're kind of 10 years ahead of what normal people think.
[00:50:33.972 --> 00:50:38.596]  Not a lot of people know what Bilderberg is, and I bet I could ask anyone here what it is.
[00:50:38.596 --> 00:50:41.638]  In fact, I'm gonna ask this fellow right here.
[00:50:41.638 --> 00:50:42.318]  Follow me over here.
[00:50:42.318 --> 00:50:43.919]  Hey, sir.
[00:50:43.919 --> 00:50:45.420]  Do you know what the Bilderberg Group is?
[00:50:45.420 --> 00:50:46.881]  No.
[00:50:46.881 --> 00:50:48.543]  You've never heard of it?
[00:50:48.543 --> 00:50:49.383]  No.
[00:50:49.383 --> 00:50:50.184]  What do you think it would be?
[00:50:53.849 --> 00:50:56.170]  A group, probably singers?
[00:50:56.170 --> 00:50:56.951]  That's pretty close.
[00:50:56.951 --> 00:50:57.911]  Let me tell you this.
[00:50:57.911 --> 00:51:06.555]  It's a group of elites between 120 and 150 that are going to get together in Austria this weekend, or this next week, and discuss world policy, but they do it all in secret.
[00:51:06.555 --> 00:51:12.018]  Now, do you think if 150 rock stars or movie stars got together somewhere, there'd be press everywhere and people would be interested in it?
[00:51:12.018 --> 00:51:12.778]  I think so.
[00:51:12.778 --> 00:51:16.400]  Yeah, so that's what's interesting about the Bilderberg Group, is it's total secrecy.
[00:51:16.400 --> 00:51:19.602]  They've got about 3,000 cops that are going to guard this
[00:51:20.582 --> 00:51:23.824]  Elite Hotel in the middle of nowhere in the Austrian Alps.
[00:51:23.824 --> 00:51:28.746]  Some of which, there's an elite commando group called Cobra that will also be helping out with security.
[00:51:28.746 --> 00:51:31.947]  What do you think of that?
[00:51:31.947 --> 00:51:35.629]  What's his name had to do with anything really?
[00:51:35.629 --> 00:51:38.230]  Well, because that was also the arch enemy of GI Joe.
[00:51:38.230 --> 00:51:44.573]  I think it's very interesting that there's there's an elite group of and they're also headquartered in a castle, which is also interesting.
[00:51:44.573 --> 00:51:44.733]  But
[00:51:46.306 --> 00:51:56.418]  This is elected officials that go to this, also billionaires, business owners, just really high-level people in Western Europe, United States and Canada get together.
[00:51:56.418 --> 00:51:58.180]  Some of our elected officials have been there.
[00:51:58.180 --> 00:52:00.703]  Did you know Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama actually went to it in 2012?
[00:52:00.703 --> 00:52:01.324]  No, I didn't know that.
[00:52:03.646 --> 00:52:08.009]  Rick Perry's been to it as well, and I think he went in Turkey back in 2007 or 2008.
[00:52:08.009 --> 00:52:09.911]  I don't know who's Rick Perry.
[00:52:09.911 --> 00:52:11.732]  Rick Perry was the governor of Texas for a long time.
[00:52:11.732 --> 00:52:13.073]  He's also a presidential candidate.
[00:52:13.073 --> 00:52:13.553]  Okay.
[00:52:13.553 --> 00:52:15.194]  So where are you from?
[00:52:15.194 --> 00:52:16.235]  I'm from Ohio.
[00:52:16.235 --> 00:52:16.595]  Ohio?
[00:52:16.595 --> 00:52:16.855]  Yes.
[00:52:16.855 --> 00:52:17.616]  Okay.
[00:52:17.616 --> 00:52:25.762]  So, do you think an event like this, where you have 150 elites getting together in Western Europe, basically discussing things in secret, do you think we should know about this?
[00:52:25.762 --> 00:52:26.602]  I think so.
[00:52:26.602 --> 00:52:28.303]  Yeah, I totally agree.
[00:52:28.303 --> 00:52:29.484]  Well, hey, thanks for your time.
[00:52:29.484 --> 00:52:30.225]  Good luck to you.
[00:52:30.225 --> 00:52:30.605]  Have a good one.
[00:52:31.497 --> 00:52:32.178]  Alright, there you go.
[00:52:32.178 --> 00:52:36.260]  So we asked a person here, he had no idea who the Bilderberg Group was, but what did we do?
[00:52:36.260 --> 00:52:37.180]  We educated him.
[00:52:37.180 --> 00:52:42.824]  So that's what I'm going to challenge you to do out there, is go out and make this the week that you talk about Bilderberg.
[00:52:42.824 --> 00:52:49.527]  I'm on a basketball team and we went and had a couple beers last week after a game and I told guys I'm not going to be making the next game, I'm going to Austria.
[00:52:49.527 --> 00:52:50.248]  And they're like, what for?
[00:52:50.248 --> 00:52:52.349]  So I'm going to be covering the Bilderberg Group.
[00:52:52.349 --> 00:52:52.909]  And they all laughed.
[00:52:52.909 --> 00:52:54.210]  They go, Bilderberg?
[00:52:54.210 --> 00:52:54.730]  No!
[00:52:54.730 --> 00:52:57.112]  See, that's why we have to get beyond this whole
[00:52:57.812 --> 00:53:02.396]  It's built the Bilderberg Group, and you need to go out and talk to it.
[00:53:02.396 --> 00:53:02.956]  Talk about it.
[00:53:02.956 --> 00:53:03.977]  Tell your friends about it.
[00:53:03.977 --> 00:53:05.318]  Tell your neighbors about it.
[00:53:05.318 --> 00:53:12.644]  Just start opening the discourse, and that way, things like this will slowly start shedding light on them, because that's what needs to happen.
[00:53:12.644 --> 00:53:23.453]  We need to stop having secret meetings run by elites where they're elected, they're using our tax dollars to pay for security, all this crazy madness, yet no press is allowed, or the press that is allowed is kept in control.
[00:53:24.133 --> 00:53:24.833]  Well, that's about it.
[00:53:24.833 --> 00:53:26.014]  We're about to get on our flight.
[00:53:26.014 --> 00:53:29.756]  It's going to be a long one, so I may not be as chipper next time you see me.
[00:53:29.756 --> 00:53:34.239]  This is Rob Dew reporting from O'Hare International Airport for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:53:35.473 --> 00:53:42.957]  Again, that's a very difficult trip to make and of course they're going to be on the ground and covering what's happening as soon as they get there.
[00:53:42.957 --> 00:53:46.159]  So it's a difficult thing for them, it's a difficult thing for us to support them.
[00:53:46.159 --> 00:53:52.702]  So again, if you want to support us in that operation, buy our products at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:53:52.702 --> 00:53:58.665]  Also we have the new t-shirt that is the Distress t-shirt, the Save America t-shirt.
[00:53:59.445 --> 00:54:04.968]  Where you can tell people about Title IV, Chapter 1 of the U.S.
[00:54:04.968 --> 00:54:07.769]  Code regarding the flag.
[00:54:07.769 --> 00:54:13.892]  Get them to understand that flying it upside down is not disrespect, it's actually trying to inform people.
[00:54:13.892 --> 00:54:18.835]  This is a way that you can start to inform people about the distress that our government is currently under.
[00:54:19.850 --> 00:54:29.755]  Many people don't understand what's going on with these trade treaties, with the massive reorganization of our country and other countries into global governance.
[00:54:29.755 --> 00:54:38.399]  We've seen the pieces from Rex Jones, we've seen pieces from others where they go here in Austin or go in New York and they ask people, what is the TPP?
[00:54:38.399 --> 00:54:39.820]  They have no clue what that is.
[00:54:39.820 --> 00:54:42.682]  They have no clue what Bilderberg is.
[00:54:42.682 --> 00:54:48.965]  These people who are protesting the G7 that's going on right now in Bavaria, not far from where the Bilderberg Group is going to be meeting,
[00:54:50.032 --> 00:54:54.556]  And again, I had quotes from a 16-year-old, also from a 61-year-old.
[00:54:54.556 --> 00:54:56.678]  They understood what the issue was.
[00:54:56.678 --> 00:55:00.621]  I'm going to read you one more quote here from a guy who was a mathematician who showed up to protest.
[00:55:00.621 --> 00:55:02.103]  And this is what he said.
[00:55:02.103 --> 00:55:10.590]  He said, these secret trade agreements that are being negotiated by corporations without any oversight, without any knowledge, really, of our elected representatives.
[00:55:10.590 --> 00:55:12.712]  He says, this is all a question of legitimacy.
[00:55:13.352 --> 00:55:20.836]  He says, if laws and regulations are made and private, it limits the possibility of overseeing what the politicians do, obviously.
[00:55:20.836 --> 00:55:26.618]  He says, it seems the only people overseeing are those who stand to gain by the process.
[00:55:26.618 --> 00:55:27.759]  Big business.
[00:55:27.759 --> 00:55:32.261]  This is what's been going on for a very long time at Bilderberg.
[00:55:32.261 --> 00:55:34.162]  And so, it is no surprise to us
[00:55:34.782 --> 00:55:39.785]  To see that this is going to converge into a global governance now.
[00:55:39.785 --> 00:55:41.626]  Go back to the very beginning of Bilderberg.
[00:55:41.626 --> 00:55:42.487]  Why do they call it that?
[00:55:42.487 --> 00:55:45.008]  Well, that was the name of the hotel where they first met.
[00:55:45.008 --> 00:55:55.134]  Interestingly enough, that hotel, the Bilderberg Hotel, where they first met, was very close to the site of the last Nazi victory of World War II.
[00:55:55.134 --> 00:55:58.737]  You might have seen the story of that in the movie Bridge Too Far.
[00:55:59.537 --> 00:56:11.386]  Now, some people have alleged, have accused Prince Barnhart and others who created the Bilderberg Group and who held that meeting at the closest they could get to the site of the last Nazi victory.
[00:56:11.386 --> 00:56:15.690]  Some people have accused them of being double agents, of collaborating with the Nazis to help
[00:56:16.270 --> 00:56:18.854]  And that last Nazi victory.
[00:56:18.854 --> 00:56:26.543]  Nevertheless what it did was it laid an economic foundation for global governance and that's the way they do it gradually.
[00:56:26.543 --> 00:56:32.891]  Going back to this article that I started talking about that is essentially six years and one month old from Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:56:33.752 --> 00:56:39.358]  Leaked 1955 Bilderberg documents outline a plan for a single European currency.
[00:56:39.358 --> 00:56:55.034]  And he points out that the documents that they saw, that were leaked by WikiLeaks from the 1955 Bilderberg Group conference that was held in Germany, showed an agenda to create a European Union and a central European currency decades, decades before they were introduced.
[00:56:55.755 --> 00:57:07.583]  And so he points out that although they might have been talking about creating an economic trade group, he said the idea of doing a currency first appeared at Bilderberg.
[00:57:07.583 --> 00:57:14.147]  Even if you could say that they were responding to something that was out there already in terms of a European, a common trade area.
[00:57:14.147 --> 00:57:25.235]  But what it shows is that they moved gradually through a European Economic Commission, then coming into the European Community, then moving into the treaty, and now we see
[00:57:26.149 --> 00:57:37.834]  Many people in Europe saying that the Greek financial tragedy is going to require a surrendering of sovereignty in order to make the EU and the Euro work.
[00:57:37.834 --> 00:57:44.518]  Stay with us, we're going to be right back and we're going to go into more detail about this and the roots of these transnational agreements.
[00:57:44.518 --> 00:57:45.138]  We'll be right back.
[00:57:49.975 --> 00:57:55.117]  Introducing Secret 12, the new InfoWars Life Vitamin B12 formulation.
[00:57:55.117 --> 00:58:01.239]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimedical grade, bioavailable, coenzyme forms of B12.
[00:58:01.239 --> 00:58:06.021]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections, and adenosylcobalamin.
[00:58:06.021 --> 00:58:09.582]  Secret 12 is simply taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.
[00:58:09.582 --> 00:58:11.163]  No needles, no injections.
[00:58:11.563 --> 00:58:16.948]  Secure your revolutionary secret 12 formula right now at Infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:58:16.948 --> 00:58:18.429]  Alex Jones here.
[00:58:18.429 --> 00:58:29.820]  For the last two years I've been working with top doctors, nutritionists, and chemists to design a nutraceutical formulation that has truly life-changing health benefits.
[00:58:30.060 --> 00:58:33.644]  Introducing the all-new Ancient Defense Herbal Immunity Blend.
[00:58:33.644 --> 00:58:42.213]  Experience the benefits of combining over 14 ancient herbs and extracts with exciting new advances in nutraceutical science.

[00:59:02.069 --> 00:59:09.655]  We have rejected, literally, hundreds of products from the Infowarslife line because they are not of the very highest quality.
[00:59:09.815 --> 00:59:12.296]  Or because they're not 100% organic.
[00:59:12.296 --> 00:59:18.900]  Or because they don't pass all of the strictest toxicology tests there are that we have listed at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:59:18.900 --> 00:59:25.344]  Whether it's survival shield nascent iodine, or DNA force, super male vitality, super female vitality.
[00:59:25.484 --> 00:59:29.306]  Lung cleanse, fluoride shields, oxy powder.
[00:59:29.306 --> 00:59:40.111]  I believe that all of these products will blow you away like they've done the thousands of other customers that have visited Infowarslife.com and believed in us and tried the products.
[00:59:40.111 --> 00:59:47.715]  Folks, check out Infowarslife.com today and the entire line of groundbreaking, cutting-edge, hardcore products.
[00:59:52.455 --> 01:00:01.625]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:01.625 --> 01:00:08.252]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:00:08.252 --> 01:00:11.256]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:16.081 --> 01:00:17.503]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:17.503 --> 01:00:20.166]  I'm David Knight and I'm co-hosting today with Alex Jones.
[01:00:20.166 --> 01:00:28.898]  Alex is going to be joining us in this hour with a report about the TPP and the TTIP and the TPA.
[01:00:28.898 --> 01:00:32.483]  We've also got the TISA that came out this week.
[01:00:32.483 --> 01:00:33.144]  Is that confusing?
[01:00:33.971 --> 01:00:35.792]  It's meant to be confusing.
[01:00:35.792 --> 01:00:37.272]  Here's what you need to know.
[01:00:37.272 --> 01:00:40.773]  All of those together spell T-R-A-P.
[01:00:40.773 --> 01:00:41.813]  It's a trap!
[01:00:41.813 --> 01:00:42.533]  Okay?
[01:00:42.533 --> 01:00:43.914]  Quite frankly, it's a trap.
[01:00:43.914 --> 01:00:47.755]  It's a trap that has been being... been prepared for a very long time.
[01:00:47.755 --> 01:00:51.316]  We were talking in the last hour about the roots of this, about the Bilderberg Group.
[01:00:51.316 --> 01:00:53.496]  We have... our reporters are headed there right now.
[01:00:53.496 --> 01:00:58.818]  We just played a report in the last segment that is filed by Rob Dew in a layover at the airport.
[01:00:59.238 --> 01:01:01.099]  Of course, they're on their way to Bilderberg.
[01:01:01.099 --> 01:01:03.381]  As we see, most people don't know what Bilderberg is.
[01:01:03.381 --> 01:01:14.049]  Most people don't know what any of those different acronyms are that are basically destroying our sovereignty, not only for the United States, but for the entire world.
[01:01:14.049 --> 01:01:21.114]  These are all tools of global consolidation, tools of global governance by multinational corporations.
[01:01:21.114 --> 01:01:22.375]  This is not about free trade.
[01:01:23.135 --> 01:01:26.997]  This is not about protecting small corporations that are domestic.
[01:01:26.997 --> 01:01:31.200]  This is about putting a few corporations who are writing these regulations in secret.
[01:01:31.200 --> 01:01:34.841]  It's about putting them in charge of everything.
[01:01:34.841 --> 01:01:37.783]  And it's not just simply about trade.
[01:01:37.783 --> 01:01:40.805]  This is about owning everything and it's going to affect your health.
[01:01:41.485 --> 01:01:44.567]  It's going to affect your internet freedoms.
[01:01:44.567 --> 01:01:49.951]  It's going to affect the sovereignty of each individual nation.
[01:01:49.951 --> 01:01:57.496]  I want to cover a couple of stories before we go back to the Bilderberg Group, because some of the people who listen to the show, some of them are covering news during this segment.
[01:01:57.496 --> 01:02:02.059]  So I want to wait until all the radio stations are back, but I want to give you a sense of how
[01:02:02.859 --> 01:02:10.026]  As they make what they do more and more secret, whether it's the Bilderberg Group or whether it's now these new trade partnerships.
[01:02:10.026 --> 01:02:15.392]  Everything is kept secret, but they demand to know everything about you.
[01:02:15.392 --> 01:02:17.814]  Look at this article from the Washington Post about the FBI.
[01:02:17.814 --> 01:02:23.961]  Now, of course, we had the FBI's director, Comey, come out and say, well, you know, it's a good thing to have encryption.
[01:02:24.561 --> 01:02:27.343]  Even though the government needs to have the ability to get around it.
[01:02:27.343 --> 01:02:27.904]  That's what he said.
[01:02:27.904 --> 01:02:30.706]  So yeah, go ahead and encrypt your stuff, but not for the government.
[01:02:30.706 --> 01:02:36.830]  Now we have the assistant director at the FBI's counterterrorism division, a man named Steinbach.
[01:02:36.830 --> 01:02:44.395]  And he came out with some very troubling, well, something that we already knew quite frankly, but at least the candor is out there.
[01:02:44.395 --> 01:02:49.339]  And I think even the Washington Post was a bit surprised, raised a little bit of an eyebrow when they reported this.
[01:02:49.699 --> 01:02:56.464]  They say FBI official says companies should help us, quote, prevent encryption above all else, unquote.
[01:02:56.464 --> 01:03:00.567]  That's what the FBI's assistant director for FBI counterterrorism said.
[01:03:00.567 --> 01:03:07.512]  He says we need to build technological solutions to prevent encryption above all else.
[01:03:07.512 --> 01:03:15.438]  In other words, their highest priority is to be able to know everything, everything about you.
[01:03:16.383 --> 01:03:18.545]  And we see this manifested in many different ways.
[01:03:18.545 --> 01:03:21.527]  We see this with the Dragnet surveillance of the NSA.
[01:03:21.527 --> 01:03:24.730]  We also see it even with what's going on with Jade Helm.
[01:03:24.730 --> 01:03:26.992]  Jade Helm is about mastering the human domain.
[01:03:26.992 --> 01:03:37.801]  If you go back and look at what that phrase means, you see at conferences for the geospatial intelligence community, where that is the title of the presentation.
[01:03:37.801 --> 01:03:38.842]  Mastering the human domain.
[01:03:38.842 --> 01:03:40.804]  How do they propose to do that?
[01:03:40.804 --> 01:03:43.446]  They will master you as an individual.
[01:03:44.352 --> 01:03:46.695]  By knowing everything about you individually.
[01:03:46.695 --> 01:03:49.858]  About your name, your identity, your biometrics.
[01:03:49.858 --> 01:03:51.820]  Then knowing who you know.
[01:03:51.820 --> 01:03:54.022]  Knowing where you go, what you do.
[01:03:54.022 --> 01:03:56.985]  And putting all of those into a political context.
[01:03:56.985 --> 01:03:58.988]  Putting them into a religious context.
[01:03:58.988 --> 01:04:01.490]  Putting them into a racial context.
[01:04:01.490 --> 01:04:04.413]  Profiling you in every way possible.
[01:04:05.274 --> 01:04:07.896]  A very dangerous thing, but that is the plan.
[01:04:07.896 --> 01:04:09.917]  That is where they are going with all of this.
[01:04:09.917 --> 01:04:12.298]  Now, again, listen to this other quote from Steinbach.
[01:04:12.298 --> 01:04:15.400]  Again, he is the assistant director of FBI's counter-terrorism.
[01:04:15.400 --> 01:04:23.465]  He says, privacy, if it's above all other things, including safety and freedom from terrorism, is not where we want to go.
[01:04:23.465 --> 01:04:26.347]  No, they absolutely don't want to go to privacy.
[01:04:27.332 --> 01:04:38.503]  Go back and look at, since we're talking about consolidating the three different trade blocs of North America, Europe and Asia, go back and look at the origins of all this.
[01:04:38.503 --> 01:04:40.725]  And that's what we're going to do in the next segment.
[01:04:40.725 --> 01:04:47.032]  Of course, Zbigniew Brzezinski was the first director of the Trilateral Commission, another group like the Bilderberg Commission.
[01:04:47.672 --> 01:04:51.537]  It was based on his selection of this group that was founded by David Rockefeller.
[01:04:51.537 --> 01:04:54.700]  It was based on the book that he wrote, Between Two Ages.
[01:04:54.700 --> 01:04:59.005]  We're going to talk about how important it is to these people to know everything about you.
[01:04:59.005 --> 01:04:59.766]  We'll be right back.
[01:04:59.766 --> 01:05:03.731]  Introducing Secret 12, the new InfoWars Life Vitamin B12 formulation.
[01:05:03.971 --> 01:05:10.074]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimedical grade, bioavailable, coenzyme forms of B12.
[01:05:10.074 --> 01:05:14.876]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections, and adenosylcobalamin.
[01:05:14.876 --> 01:05:18.438]  Secret 12 is simply taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.
[01:05:18.438 --> 01:05:20.019]  No needles, no injections.

[01:05:27.286 --> 01:05:38.657]  For the last two years I've been working with top doctors, nutritionists, and chemists to design a nutraceutical formulation that has truly life-changing health benefits.
[01:05:38.917 --> 01:05:42.720]  Introducing the all-new Ancient Defense Herbal Immunity Blend.

[01:06:06.474 --> 01:06:08.418]  Another world.
[01:06:08.418 --> 01:06:09.741]  Another time.
[01:06:09.741 --> 01:06:11.304]  In the age of wonder.
[01:06:26.779 --> 01:06:31.402]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:06:31.402 --> 01:06:37.405]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:42.688 --> 01:06:46.350]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show on this Sunday, June 7th, 2015.
[01:06:46.350 --> 01:06:47.851]  I'm David Knight.
[01:06:47.851 --> 01:06:50.012]  Co-hosting with me today is Alex Jones.
[01:06:50.012 --> 01:07:04.441]  He's going to be breaking down the Trans-Pacific Partnership for you in just a moment, but we're going to go back, before we go back to Alex, we're going to talk a little bit more about the history of the Bilderberg Group, because all these different organizations are now converging.
[01:07:04.441 --> 01:07:10.024]  It's very easy to see the grand plan now, even though the vast majority of the public
[01:07:10.544 --> 01:07:12.105]  is not paying any attention.
[01:07:12.105 --> 01:07:15.328]  That's why it's so important to have this information war.
[01:07:15.328 --> 01:07:18.950]  That's why it's so important for you to wake up others, to help to educate them.
[01:07:18.950 --> 01:07:22.793]  We see the incredible apathy at the very bottom of this.
[01:07:22.793 --> 01:07:25.795]  What this really is is a brave new world.
[01:07:25.795 --> 01:07:28.217]  As I pointed out the beginning, it's really about
[01:07:29.503 --> 01:07:42.261]  The majority of people, not knowing, not caring about the Bilderberg Group, not caring about the TPP, not caring about the TTIP or any of these partnerships or agreements that are creating a global governance.
[01:07:42.261 --> 01:07:43.743]  Their eyes just glaze over.
[01:07:43.743 --> 01:07:44.964]  They can't be bothered.
[01:07:44.964 --> 01:07:45.946]  Where does this all come from?
[01:07:46.949 --> 01:07:49.710]  It really is a brave new world at the very bottom.
[01:07:49.710 --> 01:07:53.592]  Of course, the people who do pay attention, they will get the iron fist of 1984.
[01:07:53.592 --> 01:07:55.953]  They will get the Orwellian treatment.
[01:07:55.953 --> 01:07:59.615]  But for most of the people, it really is about brave new world.
[01:07:59.615 --> 01:08:05.498]  Think about this summation of the brave new world that one party put out there.
[01:08:05.498 --> 01:08:10.581]  It's a system, they said, of social rewards for promiscuity and lack of commitment.
[01:08:11.377 --> 01:08:14.238]  Does that describe us today in America, in the West?
[01:08:14.238 --> 01:08:22.022]  The social media that you see out there, the television, the music videos, the movies that you watch, doesn't that summarize that?
[01:08:22.022 --> 01:08:27.185]  A system of social rewards for promiscuity and lack of commitment.
[01:08:27.185 --> 01:08:32.368]  In other words, unlimited sex and hedonism, but no family.
[01:08:32.368 --> 01:08:36.490]  Because you remember, in Brave New World, they took away reproductive ability.
[01:08:36.490 --> 01:08:38.271]  That was handled by the state.
[01:08:39.246 --> 01:08:44.408]  They would dumb down some and they would enhance others, but they kept control of that.
[01:08:44.408 --> 01:08:50.791]  The same thing is essentially a retelling with a technological spin of Plato's Republic.
[01:08:50.791 --> 01:09:00.396]  We saw this last week in that particular story that was up at InfoWars about the school, the Gaia Democratic School in Minnesota.
[01:09:01.434 --> 01:09:04.159]  That took these children to a pornography shop.
[01:09:04.159 --> 01:09:08.927]  And if you look at this, I looked at that study, that story rather, I looked at it and I said, well...
[01:09:09.693 --> 01:09:13.295]  Why are the parents surprised that this would happen?
[01:09:13.295 --> 01:09:14.896]  Because it's all laid out there.
[01:09:14.896 --> 01:09:34.469]  If you go to their site and you look at the way they talk about what they're doing there, they talk about their philosophy, they talk about what Gaia means, and they are consciously referencing back to this pantheism, this paganism, this Gaia hypothesis that was put forth by James Lovelock.
[01:09:35.149 --> 01:09:37.353]  I remember when I took my family, it was 2001.
[01:09:37.353 --> 01:09:37.974]  We went to the UK.
[01:09:41.917 --> 01:09:44.177]  I came across this in so many different ways.
[01:09:44.177 --> 01:09:46.418]  Everybody was talking about Gaia at the time.
[01:09:46.418 --> 01:09:48.958]  I found it on magazines that were sitting on the train.
[01:09:48.958 --> 01:09:53.859]  We went to the Children's Museum, and as the kids were looking at things, we went up to the third floor.
[01:09:53.859 --> 01:09:55.480]  It was a play area.
[01:09:55.480 --> 01:10:00.140]  And they had this tape loop that was going there that was explaining Gaia to everyone.
[01:10:00.140 --> 01:10:07.842]  And essentially what it is, is it's an idea that the Earth is a living organism, an entity, a conscious single thing, like an individual.
[01:10:09.161 --> 01:10:11.483]  Humans are a virus.
[01:10:11.483 --> 01:10:13.745]  Humans need to be wiped out.
[01:10:13.745 --> 01:10:22.812]  So it's not only a kind of pantheism where God is in everything, but it's also an anti-human eugenics type of approach.
[01:10:22.812 --> 01:10:25.014]  Kind of like the Georgia Guidestones.
[01:10:25.014 --> 01:10:26.656]  It also has that flavor to it.
[01:10:27.336 --> 01:10:32.879]  But you look at the faculty there and you see that you've got people who are practicing witchcraft.
[01:10:32.879 --> 01:10:37.602]  You look at their summer program and they've got a witch and wizard camp.
[01:10:37.602 --> 01:10:40.564]  Learn real magic and develop your skills in the magical arts.
[01:10:40.564 --> 01:10:42.946]  They've got people who are teaching there that are
[01:10:43.726 --> 01:10:48.549]  Heavily into, as they put it, gender, women, and sexuality studies.
[01:10:48.549 --> 01:10:50.230]  That's where their degrees are.
[01:10:50.230 --> 01:10:58.794]  You've got the lady who was the one, the teacher who took them to the adult bookstore there.
[01:10:58.794 --> 01:11:02.996]  She has a women's studies certificate from a community college.
[01:11:02.996 --> 01:11:06.758]  She is an HIV coordinator for a GLBTQ.
[01:11:06.758 --> 01:11:11.321]  That's gay, lesbian, bisexual, transsexual, queer, youth drop.
[01:11:12.185 --> 01:11:31.822]  Now, when you look at this and you say, this is the principle of the school, when you look at Gaia and you look at this pagan, anti-human philosophy that underlines what they're doing there, why would you be surprised when they take your children to an adult sex toy store as part of a field trip?
[01:11:31.822 --> 01:11:35.165]  One of the children was just 11 years old.
[01:11:35.165 --> 01:11:39.509]  And of course she excuses that by saying, well, they're going through physical changes at that point in time.
[01:11:40.202 --> 01:11:42.644]  They are not ready to handle it mentally.
[01:11:42.644 --> 01:11:44.325]  That's the issue.
[01:11:44.325 --> 01:11:48.368]  That's why we have laws against pedophilia.
[01:11:48.368 --> 01:11:50.950]  That's why we don't do that sort of thing.
[01:11:50.950 --> 01:11:53.532]  Nevertheless, you've got a very small school.
[01:11:53.532 --> 01:11:54.433]  It's a private school.
[01:11:54.433 --> 01:11:55.674]  They only have 25 students.
[01:11:55.674 --> 01:11:58.736]  You've got nine families who are calling for her resignation.
[01:11:58.736 --> 01:12:02.018]  They're furious that she would do this without their permission.
[01:12:02.018 --> 01:12:06.542]  And yet you kind of have to ask, why didn't they research what was going on at the school?
[01:12:07.984 --> 01:12:09.545]  Let's not get smug about this.
[01:12:09.545 --> 01:12:16.647]  Let's ask, why don't we do the research as parents about what's going on where our children are being taught?
[01:12:16.647 --> 01:12:22.670]  Have you looked at the background of the people and the information that they're being taught in your school?
[01:12:24.042 --> 01:12:25.123]  Where your children are going?
[01:12:25.123 --> 01:12:27.084]  Are you familiar with Common Core?
[01:12:27.084 --> 01:12:34.888]  Do you understand the basis of these schools that fall back on Thomas Dewey's philosophy?
[01:12:34.888 --> 01:12:35.489]  Look at B.F.
[01:12:35.489 --> 01:12:37.050]  Skinner's philosophy?
[01:12:37.050 --> 01:12:42.693]  Do you really understand this kind of psychological manipulation that they're conducting on your children?
[01:12:42.693 --> 01:12:46.936]  Because it quite frankly is a brave new school.
[01:12:46.936 --> 01:12:48.136]  That is the environment.
[01:12:48.136 --> 01:12:52.379]  What's interesting about the Gaia Democratic School is that they're so out front about it.
[01:12:53.271 --> 01:13:00.456]  They're unabashedly candid about what they're doing there, whereas it's typically hidden at the other schools.
[01:13:00.456 --> 01:13:03.898]  Pay attention to what's going on with your children.
[01:13:03.898 --> 01:13:06.580]  You need to understand what they're being taught.
[01:13:06.580 --> 01:13:10.903]  You need to understand how the school is defining an education.
[01:13:12.236 --> 01:13:14.977]  Many parents question, why can't Johnny Reed?
[01:13:14.977 --> 01:13:15.757]  That was the question.
[01:13:15.757 --> 01:13:18.858]  Well, that was never the intention of the government school.
[01:13:18.858 --> 01:13:21.899]  If you go back and look at Dewey, if you go back and look at B.S.
[01:13:21.899 --> 01:13:23.660]  Skinner, that was not the intention.
[01:13:23.660 --> 01:13:26.561]  It was not, it's purpose was not to educate your child.
[01:13:26.561 --> 01:13:33.723]  It's purpose was not to give your child tools where they could become productive, independent thinkers.
[01:13:33.723 --> 01:13:40.125]  They didn't want to give them a liberal education in the terms of someone who is able to liberate themselves and think independently.
[01:13:41.025 --> 01:13:44.547]  They wanted them to be dumbed down, the deliberate dumbing down of America.
[01:13:44.547 --> 01:13:47.808]  Again, that's a book that we sell at Infowars.com.
[01:13:47.808 --> 01:13:53.431]  Charlotte Isserby pointed that out a long time ago during the Reagan administration with the new Department of Education.
[01:13:53.431 --> 01:13:59.534]  She was brought in as an educator and she realized what the agenda was on the Department of Education.
[01:13:59.534 --> 01:14:02.216]  Of course, that had just been created by Jimmy Carter.
[01:14:02.216 --> 01:14:04.957]  It was less than four years old when Ronald Reagan became president.
[01:14:04.957 --> 01:14:08.139]  He ran... one of the things when he was running was
[01:14:09.324 --> 01:14:16.489]  That he would shut down the Department of Education because the federal government should not be involved in education.
[01:14:16.489 --> 01:14:23.714]  This is something that should be handled at the local level at the very most, but it has to have parental involvements.
[01:14:23.714 --> 01:14:31.340]  But when she took a look at this, she understood and she wrote a book about it with Phyllis Schlafly talking about the deliberate dumbing down of America.
[01:14:31.340 --> 01:14:33.241]  That was the purpose.
[01:14:33.241 --> 01:14:37.304]  A brave new world through brave new schools.
[01:14:37.304 --> 01:14:38.465]  That's the way they get this.
[01:14:39.468 --> 01:14:48.094]  Now with people not paying any attention, with everything being kept secret, they have, over a period of decades, been able to pull their plan together.
[01:14:48.094 --> 01:14:50.336]  It's easy to see it now in the final stages.
[01:14:50.336 --> 01:14:54.619]  That's why it's easier for you to explain this to people who haven't been paying attention.
[01:14:54.619 --> 01:15:01.264]  You can now look in retrospect and see how this has worked out with the European Union, with the North American Union, and again,
[01:15:01.784 --> 01:15:10.211]  Remember, it was less than a year ago that David Petraeus, who's gone to the last two Bilderberg groups, he'll probably be at this one this year as well.
[01:15:10.211 --> 01:15:12.713]  David Petraeus said, well, what comes after America?
[01:15:12.713 --> 01:15:13.974]  That's easy, North America.
[01:15:13.974 --> 01:15:17.136]  He said, we're 20 years into the North American Union.
[01:15:17.136 --> 01:15:19.018]  They understand what this is about.
[01:15:19.018 --> 01:15:22.121]  They created NORTHCOM in 2002.
[01:15:22.121 --> 01:15:24.122]  What does NORTHCOM have jurisdiction over?
[01:15:24.122 --> 01:15:27.044]  Well, it has jurisdiction over the North American Union.
[01:15:27.044 --> 01:15:30.767]  It has jurisdiction over Canada, America, Mexico.
[01:15:31.528 --> 01:15:33.549]  This is something that's been going on for a very long time.
[01:15:33.549 --> 01:15:39.712]  We're going to go back and look at these documents that we reported on six years ago about what was happening at Bilderberg.
[01:15:39.712 --> 01:15:50.197]  And then we're going to talk about how that's reflected in the current Trans-Pacific, Trans-Atlantic partnerships and the fast-tracked agreement that subverts our Constitution.
[01:15:50.197 --> 01:15:50.638]  Stay with us.
[01:15:50.638 --> 01:15:51.218]  We'll be right back.
[01:16:00.020 --> 01:16:07.247]  For all of recorded history, civilizations around the world praised the health benefits of silver.
[01:16:07.247 --> 01:16:16.937]  At InfoWarsLife, our mission is to bring you the highest quality, purest, cleanest, effective colloidal silver on the market today for the lowest price available.

[01:16:59.731 --> 01:17:04.893]  Alex Jones here with an Infowarslife.com consumer alert report.
[01:17:04.893 --> 01:17:12.214]  Many of you are aware that around the world most populations are woefully deficient in clean forms of iodine.
[01:17:12.214 --> 01:17:20.296]  The good news is our listeners over the past two years tried X2 nascent iodine and experienced it for themselves.
[01:17:20.296 --> 01:17:21.276]  The bad news is
[01:17:21.616 --> 01:17:29.302]  For the first time in more than a year, supplies at InfoWarsLife.com of Survival Shield X2 Nascent Iodine are running low.
[01:17:29.302 --> 01:17:34.086]  But what's even more serious is the supply of these Deep Earth Crystals.
[01:17:34.086 --> 01:17:41.472]  That exclusive 999 pure source is proprietary and only available to InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:17:41.472 --> 01:17:44.354]  And that supply is running low and is in question.
[01:17:44.574 --> 01:17:51.584]  That's why it's more important than ever to secure your current and longtime supply of Survival Shield Nascent Iodine X2 today.
[01:17:51.584 --> 01:17:55.570]  Available exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[01:17:59.488 --> 01:18:19.251]  Ladies and gentlemen, you haven't really ever heard firearms manufacturers as sponsors on my syndicated radio show, or the nightly news, or the news website, InfoWars.com, because the companies I've been approached by were not the highest quality, and they weren't as affordable as they should be, so I refused probably 30, 40 firearms manufacturers over the years.
[01:18:19.251 --> 01:18:19.672]  Well then,
[01:18:19.992 --> 01:18:24.055]  About six months ago, we get contacted by Head Down Firearms.
[01:18:24.055 --> 01:18:25.596]  Hdfirearms.com.
[01:18:25.596 --> 01:18:34.022]  Owned and run by a bunch of former Navy SEALs, Special Ops people, they're veterans, they're patriots, they're listeners of the radio show, and they want to support the broadcast.
[01:18:34.022 --> 01:18:37.964]  It's always about security, whether it's for yourself, your wife, your loved ones.
[01:18:37.964 --> 01:18:40.346]  Go to their website, hdfirearms.com.

[01:18:59.387 --> 01:19:04.294]  Introducing Secret 12, the new InfoWars Life Vitamin B12 formulation.

[01:19:15.419 --> 01:19:19.001]  Secret 12 is simply taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.

[01:19:29.285 --> 01:19:30.306]  Alex Jones here.
[01:19:30.306 --> 01:19:39.573]  For the last two years, I've been working with top doctors, nutritionists, and chemists to design a nutraceutical formulation that has truly life-changing health benefits.
[01:19:39.573 --> 01:19:43.396]  Introducing the all-new Ancient Defense Herbal Immunity Blend.
[01:19:43.396 --> 01:19:51.723]  Experience the benefits of combining over 14 ancient herbs and extracts with exciting new advances in nutraceutical science.

[01:19:54.024 --> 01:19:55.065]  That's Infowarslife.com.
[01:20:01.900 --> 01:20:11.689]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:11.689 --> 01:20:19.436]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:20:29.096 --> 01:20:30.437]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:30.437 --> 01:20:31.698]  I'm David Knight.
[01:20:31.698 --> 01:20:33.439]  Co-hosting with me is Alex Jones.
[01:20:33.439 --> 01:20:38.383]  He's going to be breaking down the Trans-Pacific Partnership in a later segment.
[01:20:38.383 --> 01:20:42.065]  Right now, I want to go back into the history of Bilderberg.
[01:20:42.065 --> 01:20:44.727]  And of course, we have our reporters on their way there now.
[01:20:44.727 --> 01:20:47.950]  We have Rob Dew and Josh Owens just filed a report.
[01:20:47.950 --> 01:20:49.391]  You can see that up on InfoWars.
[01:20:50.131 --> 01:21:00.437]  From the airport, talking about where they're going and engaging people there at the airport, asking them if they know anything about Bilderberg, if they know anything about PPP, if they care.
[01:21:00.437 --> 01:21:03.619]  And of course, the problem is, people don't care.
[01:21:03.619 --> 01:21:06.021]  It's the apathy that is killing us.
[01:21:06.021 --> 01:21:08.042]  That's why it's an information war.
[01:21:08.042 --> 01:21:13.746]  And of course, if you want to support us, we could certainly use your financial support, but you could also support your health
[01:21:14.446 --> 01:21:15.786]  With Survival Shield X2.
[01:21:15.786 --> 01:21:19.147]  We have a sale going on right now and it looks like it's going to sell out today.
[01:21:19.147 --> 01:21:21.908]  It's been moving very quickly.
[01:21:21.908 --> 01:21:24.108]  Likely this will be the end of it today.
[01:21:24.108 --> 01:21:25.628]  It looks like it might sell out.
[01:21:25.628 --> 01:21:27.449]  It's $10 off the usual price.
[01:21:27.449 --> 01:21:30.229]  It is now just $29.95 for a bottle.
[01:21:30.229 --> 01:21:35.451]  A few drops of this gives you a powerful dose of a key essential nutrient, iodine.
[01:21:35.451 --> 01:21:37.851]  And of course it's in a great form, nascent iodine.
[01:21:37.851 --> 01:21:41.912]  This particular nascent iodine that we have comes from thousands of feet beneath the earth.
[01:21:42.492 --> 01:21:50.393]  We run radioactive tests on it before we accept it to make sure that it is pure, raw iodine and is not contaminated with anything else.
[01:21:50.393 --> 01:21:54.954]  Again, it's time to get prepared with Survival Shield X2 from InfoWarsLife.
[01:21:54.954 --> 01:21:57.395]  You can find that at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:21:57.395 --> 01:22:03.316]  It is $10 off per bottle and they expect that to sell out today.
[01:22:03.316 --> 01:22:10.977]  Now, as I mentioned at the top of the hour, we have an FBI official who came out this last week and said, we're going to
[01:22:12.358 --> 01:22:15.960]  Essentially, stop encryption is what they really want to do.
[01:22:15.960 --> 01:22:17.081]  Let's just be honest about it.
[01:22:17.081 --> 01:22:20.203]  They don't want anybody to have any secrets from them.
[01:22:20.203 --> 01:22:25.346]  He said privacy, if it's above all other things like safety and freedom from terrorism.
[01:22:25.346 --> 01:22:25.886]  Freedom.
[01:22:25.886 --> 01:22:27.867]  He gets the freedom in there, right?
[01:22:27.867 --> 01:22:28.788]  It's not where we want to go.
[01:22:28.788 --> 01:22:30.969]  In other words, he doesn't want to go to privacy.
[01:22:30.969 --> 01:22:34.772]  You need to understand that if they take away your freedom,
[01:22:35.703 --> 01:22:37.584]  And this trade-off they'd like to tell you.
[01:22:37.584 --> 01:22:41.467]  There's a trade-off between security and liberty.
[01:22:41.467 --> 01:22:43.549]  No, there isn't any trade-off.
[01:22:43.549 --> 01:22:47.972]  If you give up your liberty, you become a slave by degree.
[01:22:47.972 --> 01:22:50.414]  Slaves are never secure.
[01:22:50.414 --> 01:22:53.976]  And if you want to go into maximum security, you know where you get that?
[01:22:53.976 --> 01:22:54.497]  In a prison.
[01:22:55.336 --> 01:22:57.818]  But that's the deal that they're giving you right now.
[01:22:57.818 --> 01:23:01.902]  And that's what they want to sell you above all else.
[01:23:01.902 --> 01:23:02.943]  That's what he says.
[01:23:02.943 --> 01:23:04.684]  They want to prevent encryption above all else.
[01:23:04.684 --> 01:23:08.007]  They want to prevent your privacy above all else.
[01:23:08.007 --> 01:23:12.791]  They want to know everything about you while they do everything in secret.
[01:23:12.791 --> 01:23:14.392]  That's what this is all about.
[01:23:14.392 --> 01:23:20.457]  We saw this a long time ago in Zbigniew Brzezinski when he talked about, in his book, Between the Two Ages.
[01:23:21.420 --> 01:23:29.426]  He talked about a technotronic era, and he said the technotronic era is going to involve the gradual appearance of a more controlled society.
[01:23:29.426 --> 01:23:35.471]  Such a society would be dominated by an elite that is unrestrained by traditional values.
[01:23:35.471 --> 01:23:47.081]  Soon it will be possible to assert almost continuous surveillance over every citizen and maintain up-to-date, complete files containing even the most personal information about the citizen.
[01:23:47.081 --> 01:23:47.621]  This was written in 1970.
[01:23:49.315 --> 01:23:52.338]  This was 45 years ago, he said this.
[01:23:52.338 --> 01:23:54.099]  That day is now.
[01:23:54.099 --> 01:23:55.840]  It's not just, it's not coming soon.
[01:23:55.840 --> 01:24:05.488]  Now they can assert continuous surveillance over every citizen and maintain complete up-to-date files on the most personal information about the citizen.
[01:24:05.488 --> 01:24:07.930]  And they want to make sure that that stays that way.
[01:24:07.930 --> 01:24:10.853]  And then he finishes up with this from 45 years ago.
[01:24:10.853 --> 01:24:17.658]  He said, these files will be subject to instantaneous retrieval by the authorities.
[01:24:18.419 --> 01:24:21.180]  That's what the FBI is demanding.
[01:24:21.180 --> 01:24:25.702]  Now, he also said something else that was interesting 45 years ago in his book, Between the Two Ages.
[01:24:25.702 --> 01:24:30.484]  Again, Zbigniew Brzezinski, if you don't remember, he was essentially the guy that ran the Carter White House.
[01:24:30.484 --> 01:24:31.565]  Carter was his man.
[01:24:31.565 --> 01:24:32.605]  He picked Carter.
[01:24:32.605 --> 01:24:35.747]  Carter was one of the founding members of the Trilateral Commission.
[01:24:35.747 --> 01:24:38.748]  Trilateral Commission is another one of these groups, like the Bilderberg Group.
[01:24:38.748 --> 01:24:42.570]  It was created in 1973, three years after this book that he wrote.
[01:24:43.444 --> 01:24:46.885]  That brought him to the attention of David Rockefeller, who created the organization.
[01:24:46.885 --> 01:24:53.546]  And again, one of the founders of that organization, or the first founding members of that organization, was Jimmy Carter.
[01:24:53.546 --> 01:25:07.789]  He was handpicked by Zbigniew Brzezinski, and then he became the little public face of the Brzezinski administration, which is what we ought to call it, just as Nixon was the face of the Kissinger administration that followed it.
[01:25:09.246 --> 01:25:16.532]  He says, uh, today we are, now this is going back to what Brzezinski wrote, uh, 45 years ago in this book, before the Trilateral Commission.
[01:25:16.532 --> 01:25:20.835]  He said, today we are witnessing the emergence of transnational elites.
[01:25:20.835 --> 01:25:22.316]  This was 45 years ago.
[01:25:22.316 --> 01:25:25.078]  He said, whose ties cut across national boundaries.
[01:25:25.078 --> 01:25:33.245]  It is likely that before long the social elites of most of the more advanced countries will be highly internationalist or globalist in their spirit and outlook.
[01:25:34.011 --> 01:25:38.092]  The nation state is gradually yielding its sovereignty.
[01:25:38.092 --> 01:25:41.074]  Further progress will require greater American sacrifices.
[01:25:41.074 --> 01:25:43.234]  It's going to come out of America.
[01:25:43.234 --> 01:25:49.016]  We're the ones who are going to be taken down to let this global governance arise.
[01:25:49.016 --> 01:25:58.980]  He says more intensive efforts to shape a new world monetary structure will have to be undertaken, with some consequent risk to the present relatively favorable American position.
[01:25:59.500 --> 01:26:04.102]  Yeah, they come at us through economics and through currency.
[01:26:04.102 --> 01:26:11.405]  Going back to the Bilderberg Group's second meeting, 60 years ago.
[01:26:11.405 --> 01:26:14.246]  We saw these minutes released six years ago.
[01:26:14.246 --> 01:26:20.169]  And again, Paul Joseph Watson, one of our reporters who is on his way now to this year's Bilderberg in Austria.
[01:26:20.849 --> 01:26:24.571]  wrote this at the time, six years ago, when this was released by WikiLeaks.
[01:26:24.571 --> 01:26:35.375]  He said, in 2003, a BBC investigative team was allowed to access Bilderberg files, which confirmed that the EU and the Euro were the brainchild of Bilderberg.
[01:26:36.377 --> 01:26:43.859]  It's nothing new to have a secretive meeting between corporations and governments to create world governance.
[01:26:43.859 --> 01:26:47.180]  We can see that's now in the open with these trade agreements.
[01:26:47.180 --> 01:26:48.480]  The document outlines a plan.
[01:26:48.480 --> 01:26:53.522]  It says, quote, to arrive in the shortest possible time at the highest degree of integration
[01:26:54.222 --> 01:26:56.464]  Beginning with a common European market.
[01:26:56.464 --> 01:26:57.184]  That was their goal.
[01:26:57.184 --> 01:27:01.268]  That's from the minutes of the 1955 Bilderberg meeting.
[01:27:01.268 --> 01:27:09.414]  He said, just two years later, in 1955, we saw the first incarnation of the European Economic Community, the EEC.
[01:27:09.414 --> 01:27:15.519]  It was comprised of a single market between Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands.
[01:27:16.741 --> 01:27:22.429]  The EEC gradually enlarged over the next few decades until it became the European Community.
[01:27:22.429 --> 01:27:28.237]  Then it enlarged again to become the European Union, officially created in 1993.
[01:27:28.237 --> 01:27:32.122]  So you see the pattern of gradual consolidation.
[01:27:33.126 --> 01:27:41.132]  Now, of course, their pattern of doing this is to consolidate regionally, then to consolidate those regions into a world governance.
[01:27:41.132 --> 01:27:46.476]  That's why we saw this being done in Europe, and then simultaneously it was being done in North America.
[01:27:47.691 --> 01:27:55.076]  The Trilateral Commission was set up to work on three different areas, North America, Europe and Asia.
[01:27:55.076 --> 01:27:56.036]  What do we see now?
[01:27:56.036 --> 01:28:08.684]  We see that America, which has been the center where they put everything, the UN, all these different globalist organizations, we have a heavy presence in America and of course America is now going to unite with
[01:28:10.245 --> 01:28:14.428]  Pacific countries and with the European countries.
[01:28:14.428 --> 01:28:24.094]  But doing so in a way that is going to give the corporations, the multinational corporations that is, just a few multinational corporations, it is going to give them control over everything.
[01:28:24.887 --> 01:28:31.309]  So you can see the stepping stones of gradual consolidation going back again to the 1955 Bilderberg summary.
[01:28:31.309 --> 01:28:39.091]  They say it might be better to proceed through the development of a common market by treaty rather than by the creation of new high authorities.
[01:28:39.091 --> 01:28:49.074]  And we're going to talk when we come back about why these are treaties and why this fast-tracked authority, the TPA, that was just passed by the Senate that is coming up before the House, is
[01:28:49.755 --> 01:28:54.491]  A treacherous agreement that denies the process for approving treaties.
[01:28:54.491 --> 01:28:55.635]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[01:29:00.029 --> 01:29:05.214]  Alex Jones here with an Infowarslife.com consumer alert report.

[01:29:20.628 --> 01:29:21.609]  The bad news is

[01:31:59.113 --> 01:32:15.779]  Ladies and gentlemen, you haven't really ever heard firearms manufacturers as sponsors on my syndicated radio show, or the nightly news, or the news website, InfoWars.com, because the companies I've been approached by were not the highest quality, and they weren't as affordable as they should be, so I refused.
[01:32:15.779 --> 01:32:19.300]  Probably 30, 40 firearms manufacturers over the years will then.
[01:32:19.640 --> 01:32:23.682]  About six months ago, we get contacted by Head Down Firearms.
[01:32:23.682 --> 01:32:25.222]  Hdfirearms.com.

[01:33:02.439 --> 01:33:05.101]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:33:15.034 --> 01:33:21.056]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance.
[01:33:21.056 --> 01:33:28.999]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:33:28.999 --> 01:33:30.299]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:30.299 --> 01:33:31.700]  I'm David Knight.
[01:33:31.700 --> 01:33:36.482]  Joining us in the next segment to explain the Trans-Pacific Partnership is going to be Alex Jones.
[01:33:36.482 --> 01:33:40.003]  In this segment I want to talk a little bit about what we saw in terms of
[01:33:41.297 --> 01:33:44.799]  Government officials being held captive, essentially, if you will.
[01:33:44.799 --> 01:33:47.121]  I guess we should call them, really, vassals.
[01:33:47.121 --> 01:33:49.163]  That's really kind of the appropriate analogy, I think.
[01:33:49.163 --> 01:33:54.166]  Because it really, if you go back and you think about the Magna Carta, think about Runnymede, what happened there?
[01:33:54.166 --> 01:34:02.432]  We had a situation there where the nobility came up to evil King John and said, we have this giant charter.
[01:34:02.432 --> 01:34:05.334]  That's what the Magna Carta was, a giant charter.
[01:34:05.334 --> 01:34:09.317]  They said, we are going to devolve power from the center.
[01:34:10.117 --> 01:34:16.443]  It was the beginning of the kind of democratic republics that we now have throughout the West, or that we have seen throughout the West.
[01:34:16.443 --> 01:34:22.589]  They have now essentially become vassals of these multinational corporations.
[01:34:22.589 --> 01:34:32.318]  And the reality is, is that just like the Magna Carta, power had already transferred away from King John to these few people in the nobility.
[01:34:33.378 --> 01:34:41.704]  In the same way, power has also transferred away from the governments that we have to the multinational corporations.
[01:34:41.704 --> 01:34:48.569]  They're able to write this just like you have the nobleman write the Magna Carta and present it to King John and say, sign it.
[01:34:48.569 --> 01:34:50.930]  They didn't ask if he approved of it.
[01:34:50.930 --> 01:34:52.972]  They didn't ask him to read it.
[01:34:52.972 --> 01:34:55.633]  He wasn't going to be given the ability to amend it.
[01:34:56.494 --> 01:34:57.655]  They had the power.
[01:34:57.655 --> 01:35:01.697]  What they were seeking was the formal recognition of that transfer of power.
[01:35:01.697 --> 01:35:06.681]  And if you want to think about these partnership agreements, as I call them, that's precisely what they are.
[01:35:06.681 --> 01:35:14.246]  They're formal recognition of the fact that power has already passed to these multinational corporations.
[01:35:14.246 --> 01:35:15.246]  Hasn't it passed?
[01:35:15.246 --> 01:35:24.993]  I mean, they can come to these senators, they can come to congressmen of every nation, and they can tell them, you're not going to be able to tell anybody what you see in this thing.
[01:35:25.945 --> 01:35:29.229]  Uh, you can't make any notes and take these notes with you.
[01:35:29.229 --> 01:35:33.254]  They defy them to even talk about what they have written.
[01:35:33.254 --> 01:35:37.379]  And they have with this fast track trade agreement that ran through the Senate.
[01:35:38.677 --> 01:35:46.303]  They have put in process a procedure that is not going to be able to stop these agreements.
[01:35:46.303 --> 01:36:04.236]  So when they vote for the Trade Promotion Authority, the fast-tracked authority, they are by proxy voting for these partnership agreements, the Transatlantic, the Trans-Pacific, and others that are going to come down the road, because this is going to last for six years.
[01:36:04.236 --> 01:36:07.759]  This is far broader than just the TPP and the TTIP.
[01:36:08.598 --> 01:36:14.062]  This is going to go for six years, and just this last week, we found out about yet another agreement.
[01:36:14.062 --> 01:36:16.904]  That's the TISA.
[01:36:16.904 --> 01:36:20.787]  That's the Trade and Services Agreement.
[01:36:20.787 --> 01:36:21.368]  It's a new one.
[01:36:21.368 --> 01:36:22.869]  Trade and Services Agreement.
[01:36:22.869 --> 01:36:23.949]  The TISA.
[01:36:23.949 --> 01:36:25.210]  That's one I didn't even know about.
[01:36:25.210 --> 01:36:32.496]  It's hard to keep up with these things, and they're going to be coming fast and furious, because they're going to be created by the executive branch, by Obama,
[01:36:33.271 --> 01:36:42.513]  They're going to be presented to the legislature, and here's how this process that the Senate has approved, that still has to be approved by the House, but this is what the Senate approved last week.
[01:36:42.513 --> 01:36:45.454]  Typically when a bill becomes law, it has to go through committees.
[01:36:45.454 --> 01:36:49.435]  So it can be stopped, it can be modified in committees before it goes to the floor.
[01:36:49.435 --> 01:36:52.736]  The leadership has a say as to whether or not it's going to go to the floor.
[01:36:52.736 --> 01:36:56.016]  It can be amended or stopped at any of these procedures.
[01:36:56.016 --> 01:36:57.617]  Not so with these agreements.
[01:36:58.766 --> 01:37:06.315]  Once these things are handed to the legislative bodies, they will have 45 days to send it to the floor.
[01:37:06.315 --> 01:37:10.280]  So they can make it quicker, but they can't take longer than 45 days.
[01:37:10.280 --> 01:37:15.045]  Because if they don't put it on the floor for a vote in 45 days, it will go there automatically.
[01:37:16.172 --> 01:37:17.993]  They cannot stop it in committee.
[01:37:17.993 --> 01:37:19.473]  The leadership cannot stop it.
[01:37:19.473 --> 01:37:20.694]  It will go to the House floor.
[01:37:20.694 --> 01:37:23.695]  They will have 20 hours to debate it.
[01:37:23.695 --> 01:37:26.315]  They will not be allowed to have any amendments.
[01:37:26.315 --> 01:37:28.156]  And here's the key thing.
[01:37:28.156 --> 01:37:32.277]  It will pass forward with a simple majority vote of 51.
[01:37:32.277 --> 01:37:36.019]  Not with the 67 votes that would be needed for a treaty.
[01:37:36.019 --> 01:37:39.380]  So if you want to look at it, this TPA that was just passed in the Senate,
[01:37:40.080 --> 01:37:47.744]  was an act of treason against the Constitution by the 62 Senators who voted for it.
[01:37:47.744 --> 01:38:01.132]  And let's understand who voted for it, because I've seen a lot of criticism of Senators, unjustly, people unjustly criticizing Rand Paul, even criticizing us, saying, hey, you're criticizing this trade agreement, but you love Rand Paul because he voted for it.
[01:38:01.132 --> 01:38:02.373]  He didn't vote for this.
[01:38:02.953 --> 01:38:04.794]  He voted against the TPA.
[01:38:04.794 --> 01:38:06.656]  Some people have confused the two votes.
[01:38:06.656 --> 01:38:11.819]  There was a vote to stop the filibuster and go to a vote for the TPA.
[01:38:11.819 --> 01:38:14.341]  He voted for that, as did Senator Sessions and others.
[01:38:14.341 --> 01:38:16.542]  All the Republicans who were present voted for that.
[01:38:16.542 --> 01:38:25.468]  But there were at least five Republicans and many Democrats, people like Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, who spoke up against this.
[01:38:25.468 --> 01:38:29.631]  They voted against the Trade Promotion Authority, the fast-tracked authority.
[01:38:30.612 --> 01:38:32.313]  And this is what Senator Sessions has said.
[01:38:32.313 --> 01:38:40.919]  Now, he and Rand Paul were a couple of the only senators who even bothered to go down and look at what they could see at this current point from the trade representatives.
[01:38:40.919 --> 01:38:43.241]  He wrote yet another letter to Barack Obama.
[01:38:43.241 --> 01:38:50.266]  He says, on May 6th of this year, I sent you a letter regarding your request for Congress to grant you fast-tracked executive authority.
[01:38:50.266 --> 01:38:53.067]  So he just sent him this letter at the end of this last week.
[01:38:53.067 --> 01:38:56.290]  So he said, I'm including that again, and here are my concerns.
[01:38:56.290 --> 01:38:57.811]  He says, under fast-track,
[01:38:58.351 --> 01:39:03.956]  Congress transfers its authority to the executive and agrees to give up several of its most basic powers.
[01:39:05.160 --> 01:39:05.981]  Exactly.
[01:39:05.981 --> 01:39:08.163]  They're giving up the power to write legislation.
[01:39:08.163 --> 01:39:10.746]  They're giving up the power to amend legislation.
[01:39:10.746 --> 01:39:14.249]  They're giving up the power to fully consider legislation on the floor.
[01:39:14.249 --> 01:39:19.575]  They're giving up the power to keep debate open until Senate cloture is invoked.
[01:39:19.575 --> 01:39:27.823]  And, most importantly, they are giving up the constitutional requirement that treaties receive a two-thirds vote.
[01:39:28.871 --> 01:39:30.412]  He gets to the point.
[01:39:30.412 --> 01:39:31.673]  He doesn't play around with words.
[01:39:31.673 --> 01:39:34.815]  He's one of the few people to come out and say this is a treaty.
[01:39:34.815 --> 01:39:35.696]  It is a treaty.
[01:39:35.696 --> 01:39:39.078]  It's a lie to say that it is a trade agreement or a partnership.
[01:39:39.078 --> 01:39:40.159]  It is a treaty.
[01:39:40.159 --> 01:39:44.442]  And as such, the constitutional requirement is that you get a two-thirds vote.
[01:39:44.442 --> 01:39:47.965]  Good for Senator Sessions, Jeff Sessions, to say that.
[01:39:47.965 --> 01:39:56.471]  He says that, the latter, the fact that it is a treaty that needs a two-thirds vote, 67 votes, he said that is especially important since having been closed
[01:39:57.071 --> 01:40:08.238]  Having been to the closed room to review the secret text of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, it is clear that it more closely resembles a treaty than a trade deal.
[01:40:08.238 --> 01:40:14.543]  And he says, fast-track through Congress would be pre-clearing a political and economic union.
[01:40:14.543 --> 01:40:19.045]  Understand, political union, not just an economic union, a political union.
[01:40:19.045 --> 01:40:20.627]  He understands where this is going.
[01:40:20.627 --> 01:40:21.787]  He knows that this is a treaty.
[01:40:21.787 --> 01:40:25.370]  He knows that this is a political union, not simply an economic union.
[01:40:26.050 --> 01:40:33.175]  Before a word of that agreement has been made available to a single private citizen.
[01:40:33.175 --> 01:40:35.036]  That is key.
[01:40:35.036 --> 01:40:38.538]  Senator Sessions has gone to the core of the issue.
[01:40:38.538 --> 01:40:44.182]  This is like the Enabling Act that the Reichstag passed to essentially divest their legislative powers to Adolf Hitler.
[01:40:45.584 --> 01:40:52.091]  Our Congress has done the same thing to Obama in the area of these so-called trade agreements.
[01:40:52.091 --> 01:40:53.673]  They are more than trade agreements.
[01:40:53.673 --> 01:40:58.418]  As Senator Sessions pointed out, they are political and economic union.
[01:40:58.418 --> 01:41:02.442]  And our Congress, our Senate, has essentially signed
[01:41:03.943 --> 01:41:07.804]  What is the enabling act of the 21st century saying?
[01:41:07.804 --> 01:41:16.526]  We give up our legislative duties and responsibilities and powers to the dictator-in-chief, the president.
[01:41:16.526 --> 01:41:21.347]  You will be able to do everything that we, under the Constitution, were supposed to do.
[01:41:21.347 --> 01:41:26.048]  The Reichstag, the German legislative body, surrendered all of its power
[01:41:26.628 --> 01:41:28.028]  To the executive.
[01:41:28.028 --> 01:41:31.349]  And that is precisely what this fast track process is.
[01:41:31.349 --> 01:41:33.130]  You need to contact the House.
[01:41:33.130 --> 01:41:35.470]  This is on a fast track to going through.
[01:41:35.470 --> 01:41:42.272]  He goes on to point out that it creates a new transnational commission that is chartered with a living agreement clause.
[01:41:42.272 --> 01:41:47.474]  He said under this new commission, the Sultan of Brunei would have an equal vote to that of the United States.
[01:41:47.474 --> 01:41:52.535]  And I would point out, so would Monsanto and other multinational corporations.
[01:41:53.513 --> 01:41:56.956]  They would do that via the Investor State Court.
[01:41:56.956 --> 01:41:57.617]  The I.S.
[01:41:57.617 --> 01:41:58.418]  Court.
[01:41:58.418 --> 01:41:59.859]  That kind of I.S.
[01:41:59.859 --> 01:42:00.760]  It's another I.S.
[01:42:00.760 --> 01:42:08.788]  created by our government, not just the Islamic State, but now the Investor State is coming after us as well.
[01:42:08.788 --> 01:42:18.417]  He says, to adopt fast track is to agree to remove the constitutional protections against the creation of a global governance structure before those structures are even made public.
[01:42:18.857 --> 01:42:26.302]  This is what Senator Sessions says, one of the few people who has read the agreement, who has bothered to read the agreement.
[01:42:26.302 --> 01:42:36.869]  Remember, Orrin Hatch, when an amendment was offered in the Senate by Elizabeth Warren and others to make this public, Orrin Hatch shut it down.
[01:42:36.869 --> 01:42:41.852]  And when he was asked if he had read it, he says, no, I'll be one of the most interested people to see what's in that.
[01:42:41.852 --> 01:42:44.314]  He wasn't interested enough to go and actually look at it.
[01:42:44.314 --> 01:42:44.754]  Stay with us.
[01:42:44.754 --> 01:42:47.896]  When we come back, Alex Jones is going to break down the TPP for you.
[01:42:47.896 --> 01:42:48.517]  We'll be right back.
[01:42:48.677 --> 01:42:48.894]  We're good.
[01:42:59.867 --> 01:43:07.933]  Despite this administration's dedication to transparency, FOIA backlogs have soared since President Barack Obama took office in 2009.
[01:43:07.933 --> 01:43:13.557]  A spike in requests is to be expected in an administration plagued with scandal.
[01:43:13.557 --> 01:43:25.745]  After it was revealed that they'd singled out conservative groups applying for tax-exempt status, the IRS cost the taxpayers $20 million so they could hand over more than a million pages of documents to investigators.
[01:43:25.905 --> 01:43:28.767]  And that doesn't even include Lois Lerner's emails.
[01:43:28.767 --> 01:43:37.855]  Speaking of missing emails, the House GOP has threatened to block some State Department funding until officials speed up their response to FOIA requests.
[01:43:37.855 --> 01:43:42.539]  The State Department responded saying the funding cut would only further cripple its efforts.
[01:43:42.879 --> 01:43:47.244]  After all, it's not just the Benghazi scandal and Hillary's email practices.
[01:43:47.244 --> 01:43:56.633]  The state's also dealing with massive FOIA requests for how contributions to the Clinton Foundation may or may not have influenced Clinton on the job.
[01:43:56.633 --> 01:43:59.196]  Leanne McAdoo reporting for InfoWars.com
[01:43:59.796 --> 01:44:06.998]  For all of recorded history, civilizations around the world praised the health benefits of silver.

[01:44:59.380 --> 01:45:19.137]  Ladies and gentlemen, you haven't really ever heard firearms manufacturers as sponsors on my syndicated radio show, or the nightly news, or the news website, InfoWars.com, because the companies I've been approached by were not the highest quality, and they weren't as affordable as they should be, so I refused probably 30, 40 firearms manufacturers over the years.
[01:45:19.137 --> 01:45:19.558]  Well then,
[01:45:19.878 --> 01:45:23.781]  About six months ago, we get contacted by Head Down Firearms.
[01:45:23.781 --> 01:45:25.482]  Hdfirearms.com.
[01:45:25.482 --> 01:45:28.805]  Owned and run by a bunch of former Navy SEALs, Special Ops people.

[01:45:59.406 --> 01:46:00.646]  Another major health threat.
[01:46:00.646 --> 01:46:05.628]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[01:46:05.628 --> 01:46:08.309]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[01:46:08.309 --> 01:46:15.351]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[01:46:15.351 --> 01:46:18.352]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[01:46:18.352 --> 01:46:21.293]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[01:46:21.293 --> 01:46:23.313]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[01:46:23.313 --> 01:46:26.174]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[01:46:26.254 --> 01:46:31.956]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[01:46:31.956 --> 01:46:35.458]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[01:46:35.458 --> 01:46:38.559]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[01:46:38.559 --> 01:46:45.882]  The ProPure Pro1 G2.0 Water Filtration System is a must-have for every modern, independently-minded household.

[01:46:55.546 --> 01:46:56.006]  Or call 1-888-253-3139.
[01:46:56.006 --> 01:46:57.207]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:19.654 --> 01:47:22.256]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:47:22.256 --> 01:47:27.920]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:47:27.920 --> 01:47:30.942]  Globalists are counting on us not getting upset.
[01:47:30.942 --> 01:47:36.226]  They're counting on our normal instincts to stand up against usurpation.
[01:47:37.856 --> 01:47:42.579]  They are targeting our normal human instincts for survival, and they're turning them off.
[01:47:42.579 --> 01:47:51.465]  There's a lot of reasons for this, how we've been culturally engineered into this zombie trance-like state, that even mainstream news and medical studies show the general public is in.
[01:47:51.465 --> 01:47:57.649]  I mean, if you play our video games every day, it literally kills areas of your cerebral cortex.
[01:47:57.649 --> 01:48:01.852]  That was in the London Telegraph and Associated Press just last week.
[01:48:01.852 --> 01:48:04.434]  And the reason I open this alert with that information is this.
[01:48:05.294 --> 01:48:08.416]  We are in red-level crisis, okay?
[01:48:08.416 --> 01:48:14.518]  Earlier in the show, we broke down how the NRA has come out and pointed out the Federal Registry.
[01:48:14.518 --> 01:48:22.042]  That's where laws come from now, not from Congress, but magically out of Obama, that they're going to restrict any type of gun info.
[01:48:22.042 --> 01:48:26.064]  You can imagine plans, reloading, manuals, you name it.
[01:48:26.064 --> 01:48:28.065]  And you have to, quote, get permission before you can.
[01:48:28.743 --> 01:48:35.306]  And everybody starts going and getting permission, then they can start restricting it once they've set the precedent that people have complied.
[01:48:35.306 --> 01:48:38.788]  So it's a major power grab, just like a land taking.
[01:48:38.788 --> 01:48:44.591]  If you can fence somebody's property off for 10 years, and they can't stop you, and they don't sue you, the land is yours.
[01:48:44.591 --> 01:48:48.132]  That's what they do with our rights under global common law.
[01:48:48.132 --> 01:48:51.694]  We don't stand up for ourselves, so we lose them.
[01:48:51.694 --> 01:48:53.555]  That's how these tyrants operate.
[01:48:54.568 --> 01:49:05.055]  So what I wanted to get to is the fact that only Rand Paul, and the media calls it bold and incredible and a risky move, gets up and demands Obama release the secret text of the TPP.
[01:49:05.055 --> 01:49:06.956]  We've already gotten two subsections.
[01:49:06.956 --> 01:49:08.817]  Draconian attacks on freedom of speech.
[01:49:08.817 --> 01:49:10.598]  Draconian internet takeovers.
[01:49:10.598 --> 01:49:13.080]  Makes SOPA and CISPA look like nothing.
[01:49:13.080 --> 01:49:14.901]  Competition being shut down.
[01:49:14.901 --> 01:49:16.162]  Only globalists can operate.
[01:49:16.162 --> 01:49:17.042]  I mean, it's a nightmare.
[01:49:17.042 --> 01:49:19.024]  And we know there's gun control in there.
[01:49:19.024 --> 01:49:20.044]  Congress has warned that.
[01:49:20.044 --> 01:49:20.965]  People have been able to see it.
[01:49:22.085 --> 01:49:24.107]  People say, well why doesn't Rand Paul just release it?
[01:49:24.107 --> 01:49:24.768]  He can't.
[01:49:24.768 --> 01:49:31.877]  You go into a locked room, run by the Senate leadership, you can see it one page at a time, no photographs, no notes.
[01:49:31.877 --> 01:49:33.939]  That's how bad it is, folks.
[01:49:33.939 --> 01:49:36.182]  And I want Wikileaks to release it all.
[01:49:36.182 --> 01:49:38.344]  They've had the whole thing for a long time.
[01:49:38.344 --> 01:49:39.325]  They've been doling it out.
[01:49:40.126 --> 01:49:42.387]  We're in a razor's edge fight against this thing.
[01:49:42.387 --> 01:49:43.868]  Here's the article out of The Hill.
[01:49:43.868 --> 01:49:46.129]  We have it blurred to themfulwars.com.
[01:49:46.129 --> 01:49:48.570]  Rand Paul demands White House release trade deal.
[01:49:48.570 --> 01:49:49.330]  Text immediately.
[01:49:49.330 --> 01:49:53.693]  I'm a believer that we should re-legislation before we vote for it.
[01:49:53.693 --> 01:49:56.414]  And in this world of deceit, that's a radical statement.
[01:49:57.421 --> 01:50:00.563]  That's a radical statement that the people be able to know what's going on.
[01:50:00.563 --> 01:50:03.484]  And they're not voting on the legislation itself, the global treaty.
[01:50:03.484 --> 01:50:09.567]  They're voting on just letting the president have unlimited power to do whatever he wants on the treaty.
[01:50:09.567 --> 01:50:12.829]  Without ever being able to read the thousands of pages.
[01:50:12.829 --> 01:50:15.150]  But look how it ties into that article from earlier.
[01:50:15.150 --> 01:50:15.991]  NRA blogs.
[01:50:17.336 --> 01:50:31.727]  Uh, says that gun blogs, videos, and web forums threatened by new Obama regulation to kill the information concerning the Second Amendment itself and the way it's written so broadly to maybe not even let you talk on air about the Second Amendment period.
[01:50:31.727 --> 01:50:32.808]  That's how broad it is.
[01:50:32.808 --> 01:50:35.310]  And remember, they had the Fairness Doctrine before.
[01:50:35.310 --> 01:50:42.015]  The latest regulatory assault published in the June 3rd issue of the Federal Register is as much an affront to the First Amendment as is the Second.
[01:50:42.515 --> 01:50:43.996]  He just put up for free, globally,
[01:51:07.694 --> 01:51:17.770]  Outside US servers, how he made a system to print the magazine and to print the upper and lower receiver and other parts of an AR-15.
[01:51:17.770 --> 01:51:20.395]  And for that they came after him.
[01:51:20.395 --> 01:51:21.416]  This is unprecedented.
[01:51:28.248 --> 01:51:30.570]  Okay, we've lost audio there on that report.
[01:51:30.570 --> 01:51:35.633]  What Alex was doing was breaking down the article that we have on Infowars.com.
[01:51:35.633 --> 01:51:37.175]  Again, while he's coming back, hang on.
[01:51:37.175 --> 01:51:52.426]  BBC's report on others, how they created the EU, created the NAU, created the TPP, and are now rolling it all out in front of us arrogantly, because if they're ever identified, then, ladies and gentlemen, they're not going to get away with all this.
[01:51:54.099 --> 01:52:01.803]  The fact that they're about to force a vote in the UK on EU membership, the fact that all this is happening is very, very positive.
[01:52:01.803 --> 01:52:10.908]  But make no mistake, under Bilderberg-controlled TPP, Monsanto, you won't be able to label, and your country won't be able to keep the garbage out.
[01:52:10.908 --> 01:52:17.872]  That's what this is all about, is these corporations neutralizing national sovereignty, doing whatever they want, whenever they want.
[01:52:17.872 --> 01:52:22.294]  And finally, before I throw it back to David Knight, here in the final segment on this Sunday edition,
[01:52:23.763 --> 01:52:29.965]  Please support us and understand it's very expensive to send three reporters to Europe.
[01:52:29.965 --> 01:52:32.346]  It's very expensive to run this operation.
[01:52:32.346 --> 01:52:45.409]  It's very expensive to have the servers, and to have the riders, and the camera people, and the customer service folks, and the infrastructure, and the legal, and the electricity bills, and breaking air conditioners.
[01:52:45.409 --> 01:52:46.270]  I mean it costs me
[01:52:47.150 --> 01:52:49.351]  I don't even want to tell you how much it costs to run this operation.
[01:52:49.351 --> 01:52:53.794]  To run this operation in New York City would cost about $150 million.
[01:52:53.794 --> 01:53:00.038]  We live in Texas where it's a lot less expensive and where we can do a lot of things, so it costs a fraction of that.
[01:53:00.038 --> 01:53:04.341]  But let me tell you, it's a big nut to crack.
[01:53:04.341 --> 01:53:06.822]  So you stand at the heart of InfoWars.com.
[01:53:06.822 --> 01:53:07.683]  Thank you for your support.
[01:53:11.812 --> 01:53:18.514]  Again, that's breaking up, but as Alex is pointing out, support us as we send our reporters to Bilderberg.
[01:53:18.514 --> 01:53:19.595]  It's not cheap to do that.
[01:53:19.595 --> 01:53:24.316]  Right now we have a special where you can support your health as well with Survival Shield X2.
[01:53:24.316 --> 01:53:25.857]  We got it $10 off a bottle.
[01:53:25.857 --> 01:53:29.078]  That's going to sell out today, it looks like, at the rate it's been selling.
[01:53:29.078 --> 01:53:34.960]  Again, that's a way that you can support your health, provide for yourself, as well as support our operation here.
[01:53:34.960 --> 01:53:37.061]  We also have the Save America T-shirt.
[01:53:37.641 --> 01:53:43.004]  Where you can inform those that you know about Title 4, Chapter 1 of the U.S.
[01:53:43.004 --> 01:53:44.505]  Flag Code.
[01:53:44.505 --> 01:53:48.167]  Tell them that it is a situation that we are under distress.
[01:53:48.167 --> 01:53:51.009]  We're under distress because our sovereignty is being attacked.
[01:53:51.009 --> 01:53:57.493]  Everything about this country is being sold out to a secretive, multinational corporate cabal.
[01:53:57.493 --> 01:53:58.473]  Just look at this article that we... Hey, Alex.
[01:53:58.473 --> 01:53:59.294]  Alex is back with us.
[01:53:59.294 --> 01:53:59.774]  Okay, hang on.
[01:53:59.774 --> 01:54:00.695]  We're going to go back to Alex.
[01:54:01.869 --> 01:54:02.169]  All right.
[01:54:31.503 --> 01:54:36.485]  Using the weapon of the truth and history in the face of the globalists that we're having a big effect.
[01:54:36.485 --> 01:54:42.606]  If more of you join us and get aggressive and break yourselves out of the trance, we can win and restore the republic.
[01:54:42.606 --> 01:54:45.047]  Alex Jones signing off for InfoWars.com.
[01:54:45.047 --> 01:54:47.868]  If you're watching or listening to this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:54:49.557 --> 01:54:54.759]  And again, that was Alex Jones and the article he was talking about primarily was the one we have up at Infowars.com.
[01:54:54.759 --> 01:54:58.461]  Rand Paul demands the White House release trade deal text immediately.
[01:54:58.461 --> 01:55:02.142]  He says, I believe we ought to be able to read the legislation before we vote on it.
[01:55:02.142 --> 01:55:08.225]  Remember when everybody talked about Obamacare and Nancy Pelosi said, well, we have to pass the bill so we can find out what's in it?
[01:55:08.225 --> 01:55:09.746]  Now we've got Obama trade.
[01:55:09.746 --> 01:55:14.608]  Same situation, except that not only do we have to pass it to find out what's in it,
[01:55:15.208 --> 01:55:19.271]  We know that they're going to change it endlessly once it does pass.
[01:55:19.271 --> 01:55:31.621]  We know that our representatives are not going to be able to amend the bill once it's presented, but after it is done, this international trade regime will be able to bring in other countries that are not currently in it.
[01:55:31.621 --> 01:55:38.106]  They will be able to add things to it, to change things to it, ad infinitum, to infinity and beyond.
[01:55:38.106 --> 01:55:39.207]  It's important for us to be there.
[01:55:39.207 --> 01:55:43.050]  Let's take a look at what happened last year when we went to Bilderberg.
[01:55:43.410 --> 01:55:49.135]  Of course, what we saw was Ed Balls, who was the British shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer.
[01:55:49.135 --> 01:55:56.600]  Again, that's the power, the Labour Party was out of power at the time, so they come up with a shadow cabinet.
[01:55:56.600 --> 01:56:01.284]  Chancellor of the Exchequer is equivalent to the Secretary of the Treasury here in the United States.
[01:56:01.284 --> 01:56:03.186]  So he's the guy that's all about the money.
[01:56:03.186 --> 01:56:05.447]  So he shows up to one of the gates and
[01:56:06.448 --> 01:56:10.290]  Infowars caught him when he was looking for his credentials that he didn't have.
[01:56:10.290 --> 01:56:12.271]  He had to open up his suitcase.
[01:56:12.271 --> 01:56:13.631]  And what was in his suitcase?
[01:56:13.631 --> 01:56:15.612]  Take a look at this video right here.
[01:56:15.612 --> 01:56:18.774]  As you can see him at the gate, he opens up the suitcase.
[01:56:18.774 --> 01:56:20.134]  We got very close to this.
[01:56:20.134 --> 01:56:25.757]  And as he opens this up, you see that the entire suitcase is filled with documents.
[01:56:26.417 --> 01:56:31.662]  Now this is a guy who supposedly supports the labor agenda.
[01:56:31.662 --> 01:56:31.963]  Okay?
[01:56:31.963 --> 01:56:33.304]  The workers.
[01:56:33.304 --> 01:56:36.147]  But this is about corporate sellout.
[01:56:36.147 --> 01:56:43.614]  Just like we had the article at the end of this week had TPP emails show a CEO joking about making royalty payments to U.S.
[01:56:43.614 --> 01:56:44.015]  officials.
[01:56:44.015 --> 01:56:49.020]  Of course it was a joke, but it isn't really a joke that they get royalty checks from these guys.
[01:56:49.580 --> 01:56:52.161]  Okay, this is how they roll this out.
[01:56:52.161 --> 01:56:56.463]  It's why it's important for us to be there, so that people can see the corruption.
[01:56:56.463 --> 01:56:59.344]  They tell everybody, oh, it's just, we're just getting together with friends.
[01:56:59.344 --> 01:57:01.265]  We're just, nothing important that we're talking about.
[01:57:01.265 --> 01:57:02.926]  And yet, look at this.
[01:57:02.926 --> 01:57:05.927]  An entire suitcase filled with paperwork.
[01:57:05.927 --> 01:57:12.931]  It's interesting to note that Ed Balls was the highest ranking official who lost in this last election in the UK.
[01:57:12.931 --> 01:57:15.432]  Maybe that had something to do with it, the embarrassment of it.
[01:57:15.432 --> 01:57:18.013]  But prior to that, at the previous Bilderberg,
[01:57:19.400 --> 01:57:29.909]  Paul Joseph Watson confronted Ed Balls when he and Alex Jones were at the BBC and this is how that exchange went.
[01:57:29.909 --> 01:57:31.970]  Hi Ed, I'm Paul, nice to meet you.
[01:57:31.970 --> 01:57:32.731]  Hi there, how are you?
[01:57:32.731 --> 01:57:34.593]  What did you talk about, Bilderberg?
[01:57:34.593 --> 01:57:35.994]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, come on.
[01:57:35.994 --> 01:57:39.357]  Breaking your ministerial code.
[01:57:39.357 --> 01:57:40.638]  Give us a word, Ed, please.
[01:57:40.638 --> 01:57:41.759]  Breaking the ministerial code?
[01:57:41.759 --> 01:57:42.379]  Yeah.
[01:57:42.379 --> 01:57:44.921]  I'm not a... Meeting with secret private meetings.
[01:57:44.921 --> 01:57:45.502]  I'm not a minister.
[01:57:46.735 --> 01:57:47.718]  Oh yeah, that's fine.
[01:57:47.718 --> 01:57:48.359]  He's not a minister.
[01:57:48.359 --> 01:57:49.361]  He's not a minister now!
