[00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:01.379]  The Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:14.949 --> 00:00:15.590]  Big Brother.
[00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:17.271]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:18.012 --> 00:00:19.113]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:19.773 --> 00:00:20.594]  You want answers?
[00:00:21.355 --> 00:00:22.255]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:22.916 --> 00:00:26.519]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:31.203]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:36.488 --> 00:00:39.951]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us on this live Thursday.
[00:00:39.971 --> 00:00:41.392]  Already the fifth day.
[00:00:43.442 --> 00:00:49.985]  Hard to believe, of November 2015, we have a lot of key information obviously to cover today.
[00:00:50.065 --> 00:00:55.747]  Ron Paul is joining us with big news on campaign 2016 and more today.
[00:00:56.067 --> 00:00:58.328]  But look at the front page of DrugsReport.com.
[00:00:59.069 --> 00:01:00.289]  We reported on this yesterday.
[00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:04.211]  Video potty-mouthed kids trash Trump.
[00:01:05.635 --> 00:01:10.997]  And it's the video itself where the little kid's wearing a shirt that says deport racism.
[00:01:11.097 --> 00:01:15.578]  So again, if you deport anyone, even a felon, it's racism.
[00:01:15.618 --> 00:01:19.560]  But when Mexico or China deport somebody, it's A-OK.
[00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:23.501]  And just the arrogance and the entitlement.
[00:01:24.401 --> 00:01:26.742]  I mean, if I was going to make a video to blow up in
[00:01:27.952 --> 00:01:29.312]  Someone's face, it would be this.
[00:01:29.973 --> 00:01:33.473]  It has little kids cussing and flipping people off, exploiting children.
[00:01:34.154 --> 00:01:40.795]  Paul Watson did an article yesterday about feminists at a university exploiting like four, five, six, seven, eight-year-old kids.
[00:01:41.296 --> 00:01:42.136]  They run the gamut.
[00:01:42.416 --> 00:01:46.397]  Little girls basically making foul-mouth statements as well.
[00:01:48.371 --> 00:01:51.373]  And talking about rape culture and don't rape me and all this stuff.
[00:01:52.013 --> 00:02:02.920]  I mean, this is just a group of really aggressive weirdos who don't produce anything or don't do anything, but just endlessly complain that people are oppressing them.
[00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:06.002]  I mean, it's really starting to get old.
[00:02:07.042 --> 00:02:10.024]  Now, we can't obviously play this video because there's so much cussing in it.
[00:02:10.364 --> 00:02:11.525]  Actually, can we edit that out?
[00:02:11.605 --> 00:02:12.526]  Can we bleep that out?
[00:02:13.346 --> 00:02:14.107]  That's coming up.
[00:02:15.231 --> 00:02:17.292]  Our report is up on DrudgeReport.com.
[00:02:17.332 --> 00:02:28.038]  Speaking of the Drudge Report video, Hungarian Prime Minister calls migrant influx a treasonous, this is a quote, treasonous conspiracy to marginalize nation-states.
[00:02:29.398 --> 00:02:34.921]  A deliberate conceptual project which could be described as left-wing.
[00:02:35.781 --> 00:02:38.303]  And that is exactly what it is.
[00:02:39.895 --> 00:02:57.299]  And you have Russia coming out and the government coming out, Putin coming out and saying global warming and man-made climate change, anthropogenic climate change is a weapon system to shut down nation-states and bankrupt select countries and starve people.
[00:02:57.699 --> 00:03:03.200]  Because that's what the globalists say it's for in the Club of Rome and Agenda 21, the UN Treaty.
[00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.340]  So all
[00:03:07.096 --> 00:03:10.680]  These leaders are doing is actually quoting what the enemy is saying.
[00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:17.947]  But this is a major sea change because it is so sensational they're saying they're turning the lights out, except for themselves, to consolidate power.
[00:03:18.187 --> 00:03:20.830]  It's so sensational that they're trying to reduce population.
[00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:23.372]  It's so sensational that they're doing it to...
[00:03:25.354 --> 00:03:33.301]  Destroy the family that the average person just won't respond back to the enemy's arrogant attack Because it's so over-the-top.
[00:03:33.701 --> 00:03:52.977]  Well, the good news is leaders around the world are now speaking out and it is Devastating to the enemy Speaking of devastating to the enemy Over the weekend well from the day it happened We began to report
[00:03:55.194 --> 00:04:02.080]  That clearly a plane doesn't blow up in midair and strewn itself over a mile unless there was a missile or a bomb.
[00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:03.201]  A.K.A.
[00:04:03.241 --> 00:04:03.501]  Flight 93.
[00:04:03.761 --> 00:04:08.004]  The state police said there was a big explosion and it was strewn over 8 miles.
[00:04:08.024 --> 00:04:16.031]  Then they spun the whole deal and showed one crater where a piece of the plane went in and said that was it and it disappeared into the ground like Bugs Bunny down a rabbit hole.
[00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:33.043]  Well, now the UK Prime Minister, now military experts, the CIA, they're all saying obviously, this is as of last night, that yes, clearly it was a bomb because radar and satellites didn't pick up a missile.
[00:04:34.064 --> 00:04:35.826]  And ISIS released a video
[00:04:37.398 --> 00:04:38.379]  And then blew the video up.
[00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:39.359]  It was at a great distance.
[00:04:39.719 --> 00:04:40.660]  We're showing video of it.
[00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:42.381]  The day after it happened.
[00:04:42.741 --> 00:04:43.782]  That day they took credit.
[00:04:43.802 --> 00:04:48.605]  I mean, what do you think they're gonna do because Russia is standing up to them in their head-chopping operation?
[00:04:50.461 --> 00:04:53.464]  So they're calling this the biggest terror attack since 9-11.
[00:04:53.644 --> 00:04:54.284]  224 people dead.
[00:04:54.965 --> 00:04:58.008]  And they're spinning it like on Fox News CNN.
[00:04:58.528 --> 00:05:00.450]  We need to work with the Russians to stop ISIS.
[00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:04.613]  This is the globalist creation attacking the Russians.
[00:05:04.914 --> 00:05:08.637]  And I wouldn't be surprised if Obama didn't give the order himself to have the bomb loaded on.
[00:05:08.897 --> 00:05:20.579]  Russia and Egypt still refuse to acknowledge that a terrorist attack could have taken down a Russian jet plane, but that's not stopping neocon warmonger John Bolton to lick his chops at the prospect of Russian retaliation.
[00:05:20.819 --> 00:05:30.521]  If it turns out that ISIS is responsible for downing this plane, that is the single biggest mistake they have ever made, because Putin now will retaliate.
[00:05:30.921 --> 00:05:33.801]  He won't mess around like President Obama has done.
[00:05:34.181 --> 00:05:37.462]  It will be, I think, extraordinarily massive.
[00:05:37.762 --> 00:05:38.022]  U.S.
[00:05:38.042 --> 00:05:38.503]  and U.K.
[00:05:38.543 --> 00:05:41.784]  intelligence officials are of the belief that a bomb took down the plane.
[00:05:41.904 --> 00:05:44.766]  But the president has remained silent on the cause of the disaster.
[00:05:45.006 --> 00:05:46.227]  One source tells the D.C.
[00:05:46.307 --> 00:05:51.630]  Whisper's website that there are concerns that the Muslim Brotherhood is responsible for the terror attack.
[00:05:51.790 --> 00:06:05.178]  The Muslim Brotherhood has enjoyed close ties with the administration in the past, and the source suggests measures are being taken by administration officials to make certain no such connection, if in fact it exists, will become part of the investigation.

[00:06:10.722 --> 00:06:12.123]  Oil of oregano formulation.
[00:06:12.403 --> 00:06:17.687]  We have now procured the most high quality and potent forms of oregano oil on the market.
[00:06:18.007 --> 00:06:25.933]  A highly advanced nutraceutical form of this key herb that has been traditionally used by civilizations for thousands of years to promote health.
[00:06:26.374 --> 00:06:32.078]  Sourced from top leading manufacturers to ensure a concentrated level of bioactive ingredients.
[00:06:32.498 --> 00:06:34.840]  Extracted directly from the wild herb.
[00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:41.265]  And sealed in easy to use capsules, you will no longer need to endure the burning of liquid oregano on the tongue.
[00:06:41.585 --> 00:06:47.429]  Used since before the days of the Roman Empire to support the body's natural systems and enhance overall health.
[00:06:47.809 --> 00:06:54.234]  Wild crafted from the Mediterranean oregano species that experts agree is one of the most powerful and most challenging to acquire.
[00:06:54.574 --> 00:06:59.618]  This winter season, it's more important than ever to secure this true form of oil of oregano.
[00:06:59.919 --> 00:07:01.844]  Now available at Infowarslife.com.
[00:07:01.864 --> 00:07:04.432]  That's Infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:07:08.604 --> 00:07:10.025]  I want more candy!
[00:07:10.045 --> 00:07:10.725]  I want more video games!
[00:07:11.046 --> 00:07:11.566]  Mine!
[00:07:11.806 --> 00:07:11.926]  Mine!
[00:07:11.946 --> 00:07:12.046]  Mine!
[00:07:38.624 --> 00:07:39.385]  I think so.
[00:08:16.677 --> 00:08:19.225]  Another time in the Age of Wonder.
[00:08:33.866 --> 00:08:44.209]  Well, things are just getting more interesting by the minute, aren't they, as we plunge into the century of world government.
[00:08:44.269 --> 00:08:46.910]  The century of technocratic, scientific,
[00:09:04.432 --> 00:09:05.093]  Dictatorship!
[00:09:09.256 --> 00:09:21.846]  It was pretty easy to predict when we watched the West turn loose, Al Qaeda, five years ago in Libya, to then take over the country and five years later it is a completely failed state.
[00:09:22.607 --> 00:09:23.868]  Hundreds of thousands are dead.
[00:09:25.189 --> 00:09:28.552]  Any black person caught in the country, even though it is Africa,
[00:09:29.417 --> 00:09:35.725]  He's basically murdered, whether they're Muslim or not, because the radical Wahhabists are extremely anti-black.
[00:09:36.666 --> 00:09:40.971]  That's why I don't get why so many black people join Wahhabist Islam, but whatever!
[00:09:40.991 --> 00:09:46.839]  If you like being called horrible names and being sold into slavery and called subhuman, I understand.
[00:09:48.157 --> 00:09:48.637]  It's trendy.
[00:09:48.657 --> 00:09:55.420]  I mean, look how the left and feminists love radical Muslims, and TED shopping, and sexual mutilation, and wearing bags over their heads.
[00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:58.222]  And they hate the West that empowered women.
[00:09:58.522 --> 00:09:59.042]  I understand.
[00:09:59.082 --> 00:09:59.822]  You're sick freaks.
[00:09:59.902 --> 00:10:00.242]  I get it.
[00:10:06.005 --> 00:10:14.509]  But we knew then that they were going to turn al-Qaeda loose in Syria and Iraq and everywhere else, that the West was funding them.
[00:10:15.851 --> 00:10:18.373]  And working with Saudi Arabia, NATO, Turkey and others.
[00:10:18.513 --> 00:10:20.535]  And now it's just out in the open.
[00:10:22.036 --> 00:10:34.546]  The Russians, a month and a half ago, called the bluff and sent in hundreds of fighter-bomber aircraft and began 60 missions a day, on average.
[00:10:36.188 --> 00:10:41.071]  And began, within a few weeks, decimating the Al-Qaeda forces, known as ISIS.
[00:10:42.193 --> 00:10:45.655]  And began to break up their supply chain lines out of Iraq and Turkey.
[00:10:46.536 --> 00:10:48.037]  They invade from two different points.
[00:10:49.918 --> 00:10:53.060]  From the southeast and from the northwest.
[00:10:54.981 --> 00:11:00.585]  Linking up and the Russians just blew up their command and control facilities.
[00:11:02.186 --> 00:11:05.769]  And undoubtedly CIA personnel in the major cities.
[00:11:05.809 --> 00:11:06.769]  That was the first strike.
[00:11:08.530 --> 00:11:10.452]  And now you've seen the strike back.
[00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:16.353]  By the Muslim Brotherhood slash ISIS slash Al Qaeda, all the same Wahhabist group.
[00:11:18.094 --> 00:11:19.495]  The same Sunni organization.
[00:11:19.515 --> 00:11:37.185]  Remember last year, the Saudi Prince, Bandar Bush is his nickname, threatened the Olympics and said, if you don't stay out of Syria, we're going to attack your transportation and your Olympics and your capital.
[00:11:38.581 --> 00:11:42.305]  And the Saudis announced two weeks ago, they said, we're going to counter-strike the Russians.
[00:11:42.686 --> 00:11:44.327]  Russia be prepared for our response.
[00:11:44.748 --> 00:11:47.131]  And it'll probably be more Russian airplanes blown up.
[00:11:50.374 --> 00:11:56.361]  And then our sickening, over-the-top, evil, collaborator, occupied, captured government.
[00:11:57.947 --> 00:12:14.743]  Has the nerve to go on every major channel from Voice of America to CNN to Fox News to the Associated Press and say, we're with Russia in this time of pain when ISIS, Al Qaeda, link groups blow up your passenger plane.
[00:12:18.376 --> 00:12:33.004]  We're with you in this fight, knowing that's nothing but PR for the American people who are supporting Russia fighting back against ISIS that's been attacking targets in the Russian-held states of Chechnya and other areas.
[00:12:33.744 --> 00:12:42.169]  So this is pure PR for the politically inept, politically illiterate, politically lobotomized, politically
[00:12:46.391 --> 00:12:48.312]  Dumb American people.
[00:12:48.752 --> 00:12:53.075]  And I don't mean the large minority of Americans that are politically aware and involved.
[00:12:55.557 --> 00:13:00.079]  Some of the most politically informed, involved folks in the world are in America, and people listen to us all over the planet.
[00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:02.101]  Because they know we're informed.
[00:13:02.621 --> 00:13:03.401]  They know you're informed.
[00:13:04.062 --> 00:13:15.969]  But there is a large minority in this country that does not know what planet they're on, and there's another large minority, together they make a majority that only knows a little bit, enough to get themselves in trouble.
[00:13:20.051 --> 00:13:23.433]  But this is asymmetrical warfare against the Russians.
[00:13:23.513 --> 00:13:25.595]  It's what Soros has run.
[00:13:26.395 --> 00:13:31.018]  It's what the NATO forces have run.
[00:13:31.179 --> 00:13:34.921]  It's what the Saudi Arabians have done.
[00:13:35.001 --> 00:13:36.802]  It's what they've openly threatened them to do.
[00:13:36.822 --> 00:13:42.927]  I mean, Saudi clerics just last week called for a jihad against Russia in Syria and to back ISIS.
[00:13:42.947 --> 00:13:43.547]  That's RT.
[00:13:43.867 --> 00:13:44.347]  We covered it.
[00:13:46.609 --> 00:13:47.430]  And it's starting.
[00:13:47.770 --> 00:13:48.390]  It's happening.
[00:13:48.550 --> 00:13:49.271]  It's going on.
[00:13:52.526 --> 00:13:54.848]  Some people say, well how do you know it's on a Russian false flag?
[00:13:55.108 --> 00:13:59.432]  Because the Russians would have had some patsy to blame and would have had some direction to go.
[00:13:59.732 --> 00:14:05.576]  The Russians are already involved in operations they've been forced into that are meant to bankrupt them.
[00:14:08.819 --> 00:14:13.523]  In Ukraine, in Chechnya, in Georgia, in Syria,
[00:14:18.479 --> 00:14:21.261]  Yeah, there's an article right there from just last week from Breitbart.
[00:14:21.281 --> 00:14:22.441]  It was also in the Associated Press.
[00:14:22.781 --> 00:14:24.202]  Saudis, ISIS, Al-Qaeda agree.
[00:14:24.522 --> 00:14:26.003]  Time for jihad against Russia.
[00:14:27.224 --> 00:14:34.728]  The head of Al-Qaeda four days ago, five days ago, one day before this plane got blown up, came out and said, we will now strike you.
[00:14:35.248 --> 00:14:36.989]  We must all come together against Russia.
[00:14:40.191 --> 00:14:41.612]  So it's a bunch of ragtag
[00:14:42.677 --> 00:14:51.941]  Well, hobbyists, Sunni groups, but they do take their marching orders from their different religious leadership that takes its marching orders from Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and others that fund them.
[00:14:53.182 --> 00:15:06.048]  And a day after it happened, hours after it happened, they took credit and said it was a bomb on board, but the day after they released a video we're showing right now of the plane being blown up from the central cargo hold.
[00:15:09.471 --> 00:15:12.752]  Somebody, I would say prime suspect, they're saying suicide bomber.
[00:15:12.812 --> 00:15:20.915]  They're saying, no, prime suspect, someone that worked at the airport, loading a bomb on the plane, in a package, in a suitcase.
[00:15:22.736 --> 00:15:23.516]  It was a big bomb.
[00:15:24.757 --> 00:15:26.657]  And that's what the British intelligence is saying.
[00:15:27.057 --> 00:15:29.959]  UK leader, more likely than not, bomb brought down Russian plane.
[00:15:30.379 --> 00:15:32.319]  CIA started saying that last night as well.
[00:15:32.740 --> 00:15:34.900]  Again, we said it the day it happened.
[00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:36.341]  I have the current memo article right here.
[00:15:40.899 --> 00:15:42.639]  Where he goes over all of it.
[00:15:43.140 --> 00:15:45.400]  Evidence reveals bomb took down Russian flight.
[00:15:45.860 --> 00:15:46.720]  That's from the 2nd.
[00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:47.961]  He also wrote it on the 1st.
[00:15:48.481 --> 00:15:49.021]  When it happened.
[00:15:49.061 --> 00:15:53.002]  And then of course it's now being reported on the 4th and 5th by the CIA and British Intelligence.
[00:15:53.922 --> 00:15:54.302]  ISIS.
[00:15:55.642 --> 00:15:56.543]  This is October 31st.
[00:15:56.583 --> 00:15:58.883]  This is when it happened.
[00:16:00.443 --> 00:16:07.525]  Releases video of alleged Russian airplane mid-air explosion after it claims responsibility for disaster.
[00:16:10.501 --> 00:16:18.310]  And I'm not bragging, hey, we told you first, or Zero Hedge told you first, or World Net Daily told you first, or Drudge Report told you first.
[00:16:18.970 --> 00:16:22.014]  It's just a fact that that's not hard to predict or hard to know.
[00:16:22.374 --> 00:16:25.838]  And when our media sat there and our government sat there and said, gee, we don't know what happened,
[00:16:27.631 --> 00:16:41.021]  It's the same ridiculous garbage like Flight 93 saying it blows up at 30,000 feet and is strewn over 8 miles and then they concoct some story about Let's Roll because they know people want to buy it and want to think Americans would have fought back against hijackers.
[00:16:41.261 --> 00:16:43.523]  Of course Americans would have fought back against hijackers!
[00:16:44.924 --> 00:16:48.427]  Some guy stands up with box cutters on a plane with me, I'm going to beat the living snot out of him.
[00:16:48.687 --> 00:16:49.468]  Or die trying.
[00:16:54.371 --> 00:16:56.333]  And most Americans, most people are like that.
[00:16:57.961 --> 00:17:01.622]  You can go to a park and walk up to some little guy and start shoving him and pushing him and hitting him.
[00:17:01.882 --> 00:17:03.843]  At least in my day, they'll get up and start fighting you back.
[00:17:05.423 --> 00:17:08.904]  No, what we were told happened on 9-11 didn't happen, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:17:09.204 --> 00:17:10.505]  We don't know exactly what happened.
[00:17:10.905 --> 00:17:14.726]  But it is as phony as Bill Clinton when he gives you a promise.
[00:17:17.167 --> 00:17:20.888]  So, what is Russia going to do about this is the big question.
[00:17:22.509 --> 00:17:23.909]  Well, Putin's approval rating's gone up.
[00:17:24.349 --> 00:17:26.570]  Even opposition parties that weren't supporting Putin now are.
[00:17:27.589 --> 00:17:33.051]  And they're circling the wagons, and I'll just come out and say, these people are casualties of terror.
[00:17:33.832 --> 00:17:36.833]  People that want to intimidate us, and we're not going to remove Russian freedoms.
[00:17:37.193 --> 00:17:39.354]  We're not going to grope you in the airports like they do in America.
[00:17:40.054 --> 00:17:42.015]  We're going to find out who did this, and we're going to kill them.
[00:17:43.536 --> 00:17:53.600]  And that's why when they had the minister, the interior minister, on television hours after the plane was blown up on Halloween,
[00:17:57.594 --> 00:18:04.958]  Hours after that happened, he was on television, in fact we have to pull that video back up, shaking.
[00:18:06.859 --> 00:18:11.401]  Because they know that Egypt's the most populous country in the Middle East.
[00:18:11.441 --> 00:18:15.203]  I know it's in Africa, but if you count it as an Arab nation, it's the most populous.
[00:18:16.567 --> 00:18:19.608]  And it is a time bomb of trying to feed the people.
[00:18:19.908 --> 00:18:21.629]  A time bomb of trying to keep jobs.
[00:18:22.029 --> 00:18:23.810]  Egypt's tried to have a stable, good country.
[00:18:24.150 --> 00:18:25.350]  It's tried to have a free country.
[00:18:25.811 --> 00:18:28.632]  It's done its best with radical outsiders trying to destabilize it.
[00:18:28.832 --> 00:18:33.753]  And then our government, four years ago, removed Hazi Mubarak, our ally, and put the Muslim Brotherhood in.
[00:18:33.994 --> 00:18:34.734]  That is Al-Qaeda.
[00:18:35.831 --> 00:18:46.357]  To blow up hundreds of churches, crucify Christians upside down, murder Shiite Muslims and others, until 15 million people hit the streets demanding they be removed.
[00:18:47.818 --> 00:18:48.158]  Remember?
[00:18:48.298 --> 00:18:55.823]  Jihadis were attacking military bases, and Anderson Cooper of the Central Intelligence Agency
[00:18:57.304 --> 00:19:03.787]  would get up on television when they removed Mubarak and said that the Muslim Brotherhood were heroes and freedom fighters.
[00:19:04.487 --> 00:19:07.149]  And he says the same thing about the Syrian fighters for four years.
[00:19:07.969 --> 00:19:08.609]  And the same thing.
[00:19:08.689 --> 00:19:25.237]  It's so sick to watch our government run by foreign banks who then openly finance jihadists that have killed 300,000 people conservatively in Syria, most of them Christians.
[00:19:27.307 --> 00:19:37.318]  And caused a million to flee, and now 1.8 million are all that's left in one of the oldest Christian nations in the world, where they've lived in peace for 2,000 years.
[00:19:37.678 --> 00:19:40.061]  One of the oldest Christian communities in the world.
[00:19:40.842 --> 00:19:41.482]  After Israel.
[00:19:43.104 --> 00:19:43.705]  And after Rome.
[00:19:46.465 --> 00:19:47.146]  I mean, think about it.
[00:19:47.426 --> 00:20:00.500]  They sit around in boardrooms and put people into countries that blow up every Catholic and every Christian and every Orthodox church they find, and they sit there and throw the priest off the top of the churches laughing with U.S.
[00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:00.901]  weapons.
[00:20:01.822 --> 00:20:03.203]  That's who runs our government.
[00:20:03.784 --> 00:20:07.408]  And now the people they control have blown up a Russian jet airliner.
[00:20:09.065 --> 00:20:12.066]  My name is Bill Bonner, and I have an important message.
[00:20:12.366 --> 00:20:17.527]  Right now, the highest levels of government are struggling against an inevitable crisis.
[00:20:17.868 --> 00:20:19.748]  But they're about to lose control.
[00:20:20.128 --> 00:20:25.130]  When this happens, it will rip our country apart in ways you never imagined.
[00:20:25.450 --> 00:20:29.911]  From where we shop, to the doctors you visit, and the family you want to protect.
[00:20:30.031 --> 00:20:32.073]  Look, I've made predictions like this before.
[00:20:32.433 --> 00:20:35.936]  A few years ago, I warned that the housing prices would collapse.
[00:20:36.276 --> 00:20:40.360]  Before that, I warned that dot-com companies would crash, and they did.
[00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:46.345]  Those who listened had a chance to save themselves, but this has nothing to do with the stock market.
[00:20:46.525 --> 00:20:47.906]  This will affect us all.
[00:20:48.366 --> 00:20:51.869]  I've posted a free video at DollarDanger.com.
[00:20:53.090 --> 00:20:59.338]  Maybe you'll disagree with my conclusions, but first you need to watch this video and see the facts for yourself.

[00:21:38.740 --> 00:21:41.481]  My dad was 59 when he collapsed from a heart attack late last year.
[00:21:41.781 --> 00:21:44.402]  Just this past August was when we spread his ashes on the St.
[00:21:44.422 --> 00:21:44.842]  Croix River.
[00:21:45.162 --> 00:21:47.163]  I loved my dad, but boy was he stubborn.
[00:21:47.403 --> 00:21:50.124]  He hadn't been to the doctor in over 25 years.
[00:21:50.364 --> 00:21:50.884]  His excuse?
[00:21:51.224 --> 00:21:52.305]  He simply couldn't afford it.
[00:21:52.565 --> 00:21:53.845]  He wasn't a rich man by any means.
[00:21:54.185 --> 00:21:59.667]  At less than $107 per month, LibertyOnCall.org would have been the perfect alternative for my father.

[00:24:14.208 --> 00:24:21.454]  Look at some of these incredible headlines up on drugsreport.com.
[00:24:21.514 --> 00:24:25.518]  Scientists studying five-year-old savant displaying signs of telepathy.
[00:24:29.901 --> 00:24:34.465]  Continuing Pentagon spends millions paying pro sports teams to honor soldiers at games.
[00:24:35.006 --> 00:24:36.787]  I always told you that was staged and paid for.
[00:24:36.847 --> 00:24:37.448]  Now they admit it.
[00:24:39.048 --> 00:24:43.811]  Rumblings of Super Bowl boycott after Houston LGBT measure rejected.
[00:24:45.092 --> 00:24:45.912]  We'll boycott it!
[00:24:46.193 --> 00:24:48.314]  We're not going to have men in women's bathrooms, man!
[00:24:48.334 --> 00:24:51.196]  People just want to jack with everybody.
[00:24:53.397 --> 00:24:56.299]  Latino group puts bounty on Trump's SNL outburst.
[00:24:56.319 --> 00:24:56.939]  We're going to cover that.
[00:24:57.360 --> 00:25:00.482]  More than 81,000 illegal alien children placed throughout the U.S.
[00:25:00.522 --> 00:25:02.083]  communities just in the last year.
[00:25:02.543 --> 00:25:07.066]  Michigan, country's first Muslim-majority city council elected.
[00:25:09.445 --> 00:25:19.052]  We're going to play the potty mouth kid trash Trump video connected to Hillary funding, which wants people to then infiltrate Saturday Night Live and take it over and attack Trump.
[00:25:22.654 --> 00:25:25.096]  You know, I'm so sick of everybody fighting with each other.
[00:25:25.376 --> 00:25:26.517]  I don't like racism.
[00:25:26.557 --> 00:25:30.499]  I don't like how political correctness is stirring up a clash of civilizations.
[00:25:31.260 --> 00:25:32.541]  I want everybody to live in peace.
[00:25:35.572 --> 00:25:41.494]  But it's not the responsibility of this country to open up its borders, and it's pure globalism to collapse our country.
[00:25:41.695 --> 00:25:42.815]  That's what's happening in Europe.
[00:25:43.055 --> 00:25:45.796]  This is how these big banks are conquering the world.
[00:25:46.657 --> 00:25:54.000]  They've already conquered Latin America, Africa, Asia, with political slavery and economic slavery, backed up with paramilitary force.
[00:25:54.820 --> 00:25:56.881]  And now they're conquering us with divide and conquer.
[00:25:57.721 --> 00:25:59.122]  And I'm gonna be breaking that down coming up.
[00:25:59.682 --> 00:26:01.403]  But getting back to this Russia situation,
[00:26:02.782 --> 00:26:13.350]  I've seen different numbers, but some numbers are as high as 70% since the Western-backed Arab Spring took over Egypt.
[00:26:14.111 --> 00:26:15.091]  I want to go to Egypt.
[00:26:15.892 --> 00:26:17.293]  My parents want to go to Egypt.
[00:26:18.274 --> 00:26:22.257]  In fact, my next trip, I intend to go to Egypt and go to Israel.
[00:26:24.059 --> 00:26:28.761]  And the politically correct Nazis, they have their own political correctness where they control reality and make stuff up all day.
[00:26:28.801 --> 00:26:32.482]  I'm sure they'll say, he's going to Israel to get his orders and all this mental illness.
[00:26:33.162 --> 00:26:35.483]  I'm going to go to Israel to see an incredibly historical place.
[00:26:36.543 --> 00:26:37.843]  I'd love to go to Syria.
[00:26:38.004 --> 00:26:38.804]  Talk about historical.
[00:26:39.304 --> 00:26:40.524]  Went to Rome earlier this year.
[00:26:40.744 --> 00:26:41.365]  Amazing.
[00:26:42.425 --> 00:26:44.045]  Of course, to get my Vatican orders as well.
[00:26:46.266 --> 00:26:51.728]  But it is just such a big deal.
[00:26:55.868 --> 00:27:01.830]  To have this Russian airliner blown up and it will only cripple their tourism industry.
[00:27:02.230 --> 00:27:03.690]  And listen, Texas has oil.
[00:27:05.511 --> 00:27:06.591]  Texas has crops.
[00:27:06.651 --> 00:27:08.012]  Texas has manufacturing.
[00:27:08.032 --> 00:27:10.453]  Some of the only steel mills in the country are in Texas.
[00:27:11.193 --> 00:27:17.315]  But if our tourism got hit, 70%, it would really hurt this state.
[00:27:18.215 --> 00:27:19.635]  And we don't really rely on tourism.
[00:27:20.056 --> 00:27:21.016]  Towns like Austin do.
[00:27:22.449 --> 00:27:25.311]  We're a major tourist destination now all over the world.
[00:27:25.351 --> 00:27:28.733]  They fly direct here from London, England, you name it.
[00:27:30.174 --> 00:27:33.737]  I'll be in foreign airports and come to Austin, come see the big destination.
[00:27:34.137 --> 00:27:46.225]  Imagine if the area you live in has turned into people, turned over people that burn down churches and cut people's heads off for no reason and that blow up and attack buses full of Western tourists.
[00:27:49.292 --> 00:28:04.160]  And these jihadis do this because they want to bring down the government that's somewhat secular and lets women go to college, and they don't want Westerners there, and they want to squat in dirt huts and have harems of women that can't even talk.
[00:28:08.862 --> 00:28:11.904]  And if they dare try to get a job, they pour acid on their face.
[00:28:14.468 --> 00:28:21.654]  And then our government doesn't bring the doctors and scientists and astronomers and physicists here from the Middle East.
[00:28:22.214 --> 00:28:23.335]  They got plenty of smart people.
[00:28:23.395 --> 00:28:24.696]  Oh no, they don't get visas.
[00:28:25.056 --> 00:28:32.102]  They bring the unwashed jihadis from the worst places here because they know they won't assimilate.
[00:28:32.302 --> 00:28:41.970]  They will run around and complain and get in everybody's faces and bully other Muslims into submitting to their radical form of Islam.
[00:28:47.008 --> 00:28:49.609]  There is what you could call modern reformed Islam.
[00:28:54.250 --> 00:28:56.431]  And I am not an enemy of that.
[00:28:58.272 --> 00:29:05.414]  But I am an enemy of a middle-aged template from the Middle East.
[00:29:07.671 --> 00:29:11.914]  being projected through religion onto the West and the Renaissance.
[00:29:12.235 --> 00:29:17.899]  And the West has got its own problems, but let me tell you, we got over being in the Dark Ages 500 years ago.
[00:29:19.700 --> 00:29:21.862]  And it's time the Middle East get out of them as well.
[00:29:23.683 --> 00:29:37.254]  The big problem is the West doesn't want them to get up on their feet because they are smart, they do have high IQs, they are inventive, and they don't want the competition.
[00:29:39.005 --> 00:29:44.309]  Only selective areas like Dubai and Saudi Arabia are allowed to develop under the New World Order system.
[00:29:45.370 --> 00:29:51.515]  Oh, they can build the most high-tech cities in the world, have the lowest crime rates, you name it, and have the sheiks go to strip bars all night.
[00:29:51.875 --> 00:29:54.437]  But everywhere else, the people are oppressed.
[00:29:55.197 --> 00:29:56.919]  Well, Russia is going to strike back.
[00:29:58.220 --> 00:29:59.120]  We're on the march.
[00:29:59.621 --> 00:30:01.222]  The empire's on the run.
[00:30:02.143 --> 00:30:04.825]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:08.897 --> 00:30:17.539]  Almost immediately following the crash of Russian metro jet flight 9268, a militant group affiliated to ISIS in Egypt claimed responsibility.
[00:30:17.799 --> 00:30:23.761]  However, many groups, including Russian officials, expressed their initial skepticism that ISIS could achieve such a thing.
[00:30:24.021 --> 00:30:31.163]  Well now, according to US officials, an ISIS bomb is the most likely reason behind the Russian jet crash that killed 224 people.
[00:30:33.163 --> 00:30:39.689]  An official said, there is a definite feeling it was an explosive device planted in luggage or somewhere on the plane.
[00:30:39.929 --> 00:30:48.036]  Europe has announced that those attempting to fly from Sharm el-Sheikh to the United Kingdom will experience delays as authorities work to provide more security.
[00:30:48.297 --> 00:30:52.921]  No doubt, Europe will soon be implementing its own version of TSA security theater.
[00:30:53.301 --> 00:30:55.463]  That's clearly meant to control the populace.
[00:30:55.923 --> 00:31:02.167]  Because as we've seen, European borders are wide open for any wannabe terrorists traveling by foot.

[00:33:14.302 --> 00:33:15.063]  Waging War.
[00:33:22.626 --> 00:33:24.727]  Waging War on corruption.
[00:33:25.027 --> 00:33:30.229]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:33:35.794 --> 00:33:39.896]  So what's going on, ladies and gentlemen, is a double-edged game.
[00:33:42.698 --> 00:33:47.601]  British intelligence is on record, probably more than anybody, funding ISIS and Al-Qaeda.
[00:33:49.982 --> 00:33:53.585]  The leader of the 7-7 bombing, a SWAT, was MI6.
[00:33:54.565 --> 00:33:55.926]  That came out on Fox News.
[00:33:56.126 --> 00:33:56.927]  I can play the clip.
[00:33:57.347 --> 00:33:57.867]  Just type in,
[00:34:00.840 --> 00:34:06.806]  7-7 bombings, MI6, you'll get Reuters, AP, BBC, Fox News.
[00:34:07.627 --> 00:34:11.651]  I've had John Loftus, former head of anti-terrorism, the Justice Department, on to talk about it.
[00:34:12.772 --> 00:34:13.914]  We should get Loftus back on.
[00:34:13.934 --> 00:34:14.534]  He's a good guest.
[00:34:15.655 --> 00:34:16.917]  I mean, this is really going on.
[00:34:16.957 --> 00:34:19.599]  So Cameron comes out and says, how dare ISIS do this?
[00:34:19.619 --> 00:34:20.440]  We believe it's ISIS.
[00:34:20.901 --> 00:34:22.903]  We stand with Russia against this.
[00:34:25.816 --> 00:34:35.683]  Because they know full well they have funded ISIS with NATO, the United States, Turkey and others, Saudi Arabia with the money for four or five years.
[00:34:35.703 --> 00:34:38.925]  They just started calling it ISIS in the last year and a half.
[00:34:41.727 --> 00:34:44.930]  And then the White House comes out and says, yeah, looks like it's ISIS.
[00:34:44.970 --> 00:34:45.810]  Boy, we're upset.
[00:34:46.191 --> 00:34:51.955]  We better crack down on people's rights here in America for the very threat they've helped embolden.
[00:34:52.622 --> 00:34:55.765]  I thought Al Qaeda, you know, two years ago was gone and defeated.
[00:34:56.146 --> 00:34:59.849]  And now it's just back, bigger than ever, working with ISIS, the same group.
[00:35:01.151 --> 00:35:03.193]  Now it's got a multi-hundred thousand man army.
[00:35:07.423 --> 00:35:09.805]  So they get to take Western liberties because of this threat.
[00:35:10.205 --> 00:35:12.027]  They get to roll out more naked body scanners.
[00:35:12.927 --> 00:35:16.490]  They've got all these different jihad groups that aren't even controlled by the West.
[00:35:16.790 --> 00:35:18.532]  They were bred.
[00:35:18.632 --> 00:35:19.553]  They were created.
[00:35:19.573 --> 00:35:35.105]  Like I said, if you bred and raised a hundred black widows and then went and dumped them in your neighbor's bedroom during the day, knowing they'd go underneath the bed during the sunlight and come out at night and bite you.
[00:35:37.267 --> 00:35:38.668]  Do you run the Black Widows?
[00:35:38.868 --> 00:35:39.788]  Do you control them?
[00:35:39.868 --> 00:35:40.068]  No.
[00:35:40.388 --> 00:35:41.088]  Did you breed them?
[00:35:41.108 --> 00:35:42.129]  Did you dump them in the bed?
[00:35:42.229 --> 00:35:42.489]  Yes.
[00:35:42.969 --> 00:35:44.210]  Same thing with a rattlesnake.
[00:35:48.751 --> 00:35:51.432]  It's like, do you control an ampule of pure cyanide?
[00:35:51.892 --> 00:35:52.633]  Does it love you?
[00:35:52.673 --> 00:35:53.733]  Does it have a consciousness?
[00:35:53.993 --> 00:35:55.053]  Does it follow your orders?
[00:35:55.133 --> 00:35:55.314]  No.
[00:35:55.734 --> 00:35:59.215]  But if you put it in somebody's iced tea and they take one drink, they're gonna die in 60 seconds.
[00:36:00.075 --> 00:36:01.956]  Flopping around on the ground, biting their tongue off.
[00:36:07.423 --> 00:36:14.309]  And so, you're still 100% guilty of the Black Widow, of the Rattlesnake, of the Cyanide, if it kills the person.
[00:36:15.470 --> 00:36:34.247]  So, the way the West is acting, it's almost like they may not have ordered the Muslim Brotherhood, ISIS, Al-Nusra, Al-Qaeda, all the same people to do this, because the West is really distancing itself from this, or is it more of the cynical double-edged game of, hey, we didn't do this, we didn't do this,
[00:36:35.345 --> 00:36:43.190]  I've told you over and over again that the ISIS forces and Al-Qaeda forces, they've turned loose, will start blowing up jet airliners, and I predicted they'll start doing it with Stinger missiles.
[00:36:43.550 --> 00:36:49.994]  And so everybody's saying this is a bomb, and satellites didn't pick it up, and radar didn't pick up a missile.
[00:36:52.536 --> 00:36:53.256]  I looked into that.
[00:36:53.296 --> 00:36:55.378]  A lot of times radar doesn't pick up a small missile.
[00:36:58.219 --> 00:36:59.140]  And I looked into something else.
[00:37:03.894 --> 00:37:06.495]  It could have been somebody there working inside the airport that did it.
[00:37:06.515 --> 00:37:09.756]  The British intelligence says they're gonna stop flying British flights probably out of that airport.
[00:37:10.296 --> 00:37:13.237]  They think, common sense, that it would probably be somebody on the ground.
[00:37:14.757 --> 00:37:16.878]  It's easier to do that than to smuggle a bomb on board.
[00:37:16.918 --> 00:37:22.419]  You just, an inside job, you load a bomb in a suitcase or a briefcase or a backpack.
[00:37:23.400 --> 00:37:26.140]  Or you load it in with the food shipment that's being put on board the plane.
[00:37:27.321 --> 00:37:27.901]  In a compartment.
[00:37:30.762 --> 00:37:35.984]  But Clapper came out the day after it happened and said ISIS might be able to shoot down aircraft with surface-to-air missiles.
[00:37:36.064 --> 00:37:37.404]  That was in Sputnik News.
[00:37:41.285 --> 00:37:42.366]  But he made the quote to U.S.
[00:37:42.406 --> 00:37:42.786]  reporters.
[00:37:44.927 --> 00:37:45.467]  Made the statement.
[00:37:46.787 --> 00:37:48.188]  So this could be a missile.
[00:37:48.728 --> 00:37:49.508]  I'm not saying that.
[00:37:49.768 --> 00:37:51.969]  We obviously know it didn't just blow up on its own now.
[00:37:51.989 --> 00:37:53.549]  I mean, day one we knew that.
[00:37:54.730 --> 00:37:58.471]  But see, they don't want people panicking over the thousands of surface-to-air missiles.
[00:37:59.633 --> 00:38:17.766]  That the jihadis now have and they could be holding people hostage and saying if Russia and the US and others don't start paying us and don't let us take over part of Syria and Iraq and set up our caliphate, we will shoot down 10 jetliners next week, 20 the next and 30 the next, 100 the next.
[00:38:19.106 --> 00:38:20.608]  And I said this probably
[00:38:22.347 --> 00:38:25.608]  A hundred plus times and told folks to mark down the dates of it.
[00:38:25.648 --> 00:38:26.469]  I don't know if we did.
[00:38:27.109 --> 00:38:33.592]  On the show the last few years since Benghazi, saying this would end up happening and it looks like we're now entering that area.
[00:38:35.073 --> 00:38:38.014]  There's a lot of stuff going on behind the scenes that we're not being told about.
[00:38:38.574 --> 00:38:40.075]  But I know how these groups operate.
[00:38:40.275 --> 00:38:41.155]  I know their mindset.
[00:38:43.796 --> 00:38:49.279]  But whether it was a bomb, altitude triggered bomb, or whether it was a missile,
[00:38:50.782 --> 00:39:02.286]  The main suspects are the Saudi Arabian Sunni Wahhabist running rampant all over the world, from Indonesia to Iraq to the United States.
[00:39:02.726 --> 00:39:17.391]  And when they shoot up an Army-Navy recruiting center, when they shoot up a Marine Corps recruiting center, when they shoot up a Dallas suburb of Garland, what does the media say?
[00:39:18.091 --> 00:39:20.312]  They were Muslims, but it's not connected to terror.
[00:39:25.100 --> 00:39:28.242]  But every couple of years some lunatic into a death cult.
[00:39:28.642 --> 00:39:29.422]  It's always the same.
[00:39:29.442 --> 00:39:32.324]  They're always obsessed with weird comic books that are into death.
[00:39:32.384 --> 00:39:33.284]  That's just the MO.
[00:39:33.584 --> 00:39:34.585]  That's the criminology.
[00:39:34.945 --> 00:39:40.307]  They've had maybe once every couple of years some group go out and shoot cops or go out and shoot people.
[00:39:41.448 --> 00:39:46.751]  And then they tenuously connect them out of their hard drive to visiting InfoWars.com.
[00:39:49.062 --> 00:39:55.424]  Or Tea Party USA, and they go on the news and say, listeners of Alex Jones killed cops in Vegas.
[00:39:56.905 --> 00:40:09.029]  But when it's actual jihadists saying on their Facebook, I'm doing this for the caliphate, I'm doing this, then it's, oh no, that's not related or connected or anything else, it's, no, it's the Tea Party's fault.
[00:40:11.350 --> 00:40:12.511]  So I ask the question,
[00:40:13.467 --> 00:40:21.533]  Ron Paul is coming up at the bottom of the next hour, but I want to open the phones up on this situation with police, military, former military, airline people, security folks.
[00:40:21.593 --> 00:40:22.394]  I want to get your take.
[00:40:22.414 --> 00:40:23.734]  I mean, do you think I'm wrong in any way?
[00:40:24.555 --> 00:40:26.356]  And what do you think Russia's response is going to be?
[00:40:26.376 --> 00:40:31.860]  And my gut just tells me that there are ransoms going out right now.
[00:40:31.900 --> 00:40:33.502]  That's just, nobody else is saying that.
[00:40:33.582 --> 00:40:37.324]  My gut tells me they wanted those thousands of missiles.
[00:40:37.384 --> 00:40:38.805]  They wanted Stevens out of the way.
[00:40:38.825 --> 00:40:40.667]  I mean, we know this.
[00:40:42.668 --> 00:40:45.430]  So that they could do whatever they wanted with those missiles, and it was something big.
[00:40:45.450 --> 00:40:51.274]  And I said, is it hold the West hostage and create some global crisis in the future?
[00:40:53.316 --> 00:41:02.883]  Or is it a covert plan to threaten to bring passenger liner traffic to a standstill in many regions, which would devastate the economy?
[00:41:04.844 --> 00:41:11.269]  See, you don't have to wait for Spectre to come out in a few weeks to go watch an action-adventure movie with evil organizations manipulating.
[00:41:11.629 --> 00:41:13.851]  In the real world, that's what's going on.
[00:41:14.151 --> 00:41:21.176]  And I'm just sitting back, watching this, and I think there's more than meets the eye beneath the surface.
[00:41:21.216 --> 00:41:22.077]  I mean, we know there is.
[00:41:24.499 --> 00:41:27.361]  But my gut tells me there's ransoms going on.
[00:41:30.123 --> 00:41:46.306]  My gut tells me the Muslim Brotherhood is telling the Egyptian government, you're going to let us come back to power, or we're going to blow up five more jet airliners in Egypt alone in the next month, and then you're not going to have any money coming in, and the economy's going to implode.
[00:41:46.606 --> 00:41:49.567]  We're going to cut the golden goose's head off.
[00:41:49.647 --> 00:41:54.508]  I mean, some estimates are half of Egypt's economy is terrorism.
[00:41:56.168 --> 00:41:57.829]  The rest is obviously agrarian.
[00:41:58.749 --> 00:41:59.709]  It's a farming culture.
[00:42:01.462 --> 00:42:03.484]  And they've got a giant young population.
[00:42:03.864 --> 00:42:06.086]  It is a time bomb.
[00:42:06.546 --> 00:42:07.788]  And it came out in Egyptian courts.
[00:42:07.828 --> 00:42:18.677]  They have the documents that Obama's family out of Kenya, just south of Egypt, is quarterbacking, key term, running the Muslim Brotherhood operations in that country.
[00:42:19.057 --> 00:42:23.001]  And now the State Department and others are saying, could it be connected?
[00:42:24.362 --> 00:42:25.904]  That article's on Infowars.com.
[00:42:26.304 --> 00:42:27.345]  Could it be connected?
[00:42:29.994 --> 00:42:33.077]  To the Muslim Brotherhood, and is that why Obama is so silent?
[00:42:34.258 --> 00:42:36.300]  Is Obama now being held hostage?
[00:42:36.520 --> 00:42:37.661]  Let's look at some of these headlines.
[00:42:39.683 --> 00:42:44.088]  Up on Infowars.com, Piers Morgan, ISIS will nuke America.
[00:42:45.353 --> 00:42:47.994]  Remember Obama said the one thing he's worried about is a nuke going off in Manhattan?
[00:42:48.275 --> 00:42:51.857]  Now how about Obama nukes America and declares a civil emergency?
[00:42:52.237 --> 00:42:52.737]  Video!
[00:42:53.037 --> 00:42:58.760]  Hungarian Prime Minister calls migrant influx a treasonous conspiracy to marginalize nation states.
[00:42:59.461 --> 00:43:00.581]  Bingo, bingo, bingo!
[00:43:00.681 --> 00:43:02.142]  You win the prize!
[00:43:02.222 --> 00:43:02.743]  Blue ribbon!
[00:43:03.703 --> 00:43:13.969]  Neocon warmonger expects extraordinarily massive, that's Steve Watson's headline, military retaliation by Putin against ISIS over Russia plane crash.
[00:43:16.257 --> 00:43:25.963]  You know, I don't like Bolton, and Bolton was a warmonger and did help lie about Iraq and what happened there, but I don't even know if the statement warmonger even means anything.
[00:43:26.203 --> 00:43:34.228]  The former ambassador to the UN, the former US ambassador to the UN, expects a huge response from Russia.
[00:43:34.308 --> 00:43:36.069]  And then you can add in there that he's a warmonger.
[00:43:40.391 --> 00:43:41.712]  The point is, he's probably right.
[00:43:45.731 --> 00:43:46.151]  There it is.
[00:43:46.251 --> 00:43:46.552]  Source.
[00:43:46.612 --> 00:43:49.434]  Obama fears Muslim Brotherhood linked to downing a Russian airliner.
[00:43:49.474 --> 00:43:50.094]  He fears it?
[00:43:51.916 --> 00:43:53.056]  They took credit for it.
[00:43:53.076 --> 00:43:54.758]  Who do you think the Muslim Brotherhood is?
[00:43:54.878 --> 00:43:56.359]  It is the Sunnis.
[00:43:57.460 --> 00:44:00.542]  And I don't mean every Sunni Muslim is a bad person.
[00:44:01.082 --> 00:44:03.104]  Look at Syrian girl.
[00:44:03.144 --> 00:44:04.485]  Her family are exiles out of Syria.
[00:44:04.505 --> 00:44:05.245]  They don't like Assad.
[00:44:05.465 --> 00:44:07.427]  But they're breaking the country up and killing everybody.
[00:44:08.368 --> 00:44:12.791]  It's radical Islam run by Saudi Arabia who wants to dictate Islam to everybody else.
[00:44:13.993 --> 00:44:16.234]  Obama's brothers linked directly to the Muslim Brotherhood.
[00:44:16.555 --> 00:44:27.021]  His cousin, he had in a memo to his cousin when he was a senator, he said, have riots be staged, dodinga, all over the country, and then they'll give you a position in the government.
[00:44:27.181 --> 00:44:29.002]  They made a prime ministership for him.
[00:44:30.403 --> 00:44:33.044]  And that's what they're threatening now with Quentin Tarantino.
[00:44:34.445 --> 00:44:40.829]  And look, I had a lawyer in here yesterday that's suing the Austin Police Department over a detective killing somebody in cold blood.
[00:44:42.025 --> 00:44:43.586]  And the guy should just admit he broke down.
[00:44:43.626 --> 00:44:44.687]  He's mentally ill, probably.
[00:44:44.727 --> 00:44:46.748]  I'm not saying he's... I'm just saying it seemed like he was crazy.
[00:44:47.449 --> 00:44:48.870]  You know, witnesses were there.
[00:44:48.930 --> 00:44:49.950]  The guys had to admit it.
[00:44:49.970 --> 00:44:54.453]  Just got him out on his knees and shot the guy in the back of the head for just no reason.
[00:44:55.114 --> 00:44:56.295]  We expose bad cops.
[00:44:56.715 --> 00:45:03.420]  But statistically, police kill, what is it, about 400, 500 people a year?
[00:45:03.440 --> 00:45:10.865]  I mean, back in the 70s and 60s, it was thousands a year.
[00:45:11.533 --> 00:45:15.476]  Because there were shootouts and violence and cops have always had some bad people.
[00:45:15.496 --> 00:45:18.318]  There's always been problems and we expose that.
[00:45:21.260 --> 00:45:36.271]  But Quentin Tarantino with the movies he puts out like Django Unchained and all of this is torture porn, race porn, exploitation porn, and it is designed
[00:45:39.273 --> 00:45:57.798]  100% to create racial division and I happen to know folks that have worked with Robert Rodriguez's best buddy and that are connected to Tarantino and they meet with Obama, they meet with the Weinstein brothers, they have an agenda and are given the funding to create racial division.
[00:45:57.818 --> 00:46:00.479]  I mean that's obvious now but I told you about it years ago.
[00:46:01.699 --> 00:46:04.060]  Robert Rodriguez hates me so much
[00:46:05.623 --> 00:46:09.644]  That if you even mention my name to him, he begins exploding in anger.
[00:46:11.445 --> 00:46:15.306]  I was told this on the set of Scanner Darkly.
[00:46:19.367 --> 00:46:22.628]  Back when Rodriguez was still married, his ex-wife was a listener.
[00:46:25.809 --> 00:46:28.950]  He hates white people so much, he left his Hispanic wife for white women.
[00:46:30.270 --> 00:46:33.611]  But his Hispanic wife is a big listener, co-owner of his studios.
[00:46:35.163 --> 00:46:38.747]  That she tried to give him some of my films and he had a complete meltdown.
[00:46:38.967 --> 00:46:40.269]  And he's been in the newspapers attacking me.
[00:46:41.130 --> 00:46:46.976]  Because I know the White House funds him to put out movies that show good old boys shooting pregnant Hispanic women.
[00:46:47.657 --> 00:46:49.319]  That's not going on, brother.
[00:46:50.640 --> 00:46:51.682]  That we can even find.
[00:46:52.462 --> 00:46:56.227]  Are 100,000 Mexicans getting killed by other corrupt Mexicans?
[00:46:58.902 --> 00:47:05.725]  Do they catch people coming across the border who've already paid to be coyote-ed in, and then they torture them to death and suck money out of their family?
[00:47:06.865 --> 00:47:08.106]  Oh, but that's not your film, is it?
[00:47:08.286 --> 00:47:14.568]  Because you're too cool hanging out with all the South Texas... El Jefes, aren't you?
[00:47:14.768 --> 00:47:21.511]  The truth is, you all think it's real fun to wear your fancy cowboy hat and your boots and fly around in helicopters and hang around with all the rich Mexicans.
[00:47:21.531 --> 00:47:22.691]  We know who they are, don't we?
[00:47:23.131 --> 00:47:26.913]  And then you make a movie where white people are shooting Mexicans in the stomach, don't you?
[00:47:29.002 --> 00:47:33.727]  Of course, you don't make a movie where white CIA agents are helping destabilize the country and part of it.
[00:47:33.887 --> 00:47:35.248]  Those are the white people involved.
[00:47:35.348 --> 00:47:36.009]  No, no, no.
[00:47:36.269 --> 00:47:40.093]  Or Hispanics being forcibly injected with Gardasil that basically sterilizes them.
[00:47:41.114 --> 00:47:42.135]  No, no, no, no, no.
[00:47:43.656 --> 00:47:45.498]  See, he doesn't hate me because I'm white.
[00:47:45.878 --> 00:47:47.240]  He hates me because I know who he is.
[00:47:51.172 --> 00:47:51.852]  He's a dirtbag.
[00:47:52.552 --> 00:47:53.873]  Just like Quentin Tarantino.
[00:47:54.173 --> 00:47:58.514]  Am I against Tarantino because he went and said some of these blacks are getting murdered by crazy cops?
[00:47:58.614 --> 00:47:59.194]  Absolutely!
[00:47:59.374 --> 00:48:00.094]  There's bad cops.
[00:48:00.294 --> 00:48:00.894]  It's going on.
[00:48:01.014 --> 00:48:02.455]  They're getting indicted in many areas.
[00:48:03.635 --> 00:48:07.056]  Cop shot that black guy in the back of the park, got caught on video, indicted.
[00:48:07.396 --> 00:48:08.416]  And he better get convicted.
[00:48:08.856 --> 00:48:09.976]  That cop's crazy.
[00:48:10.956 --> 00:48:12.857]  That cop's a trigger-happy murderer.
[00:48:14.497 --> 00:48:19.520]  But cops aren't murderers like Tarantino said in a speech that the police are murderers.
[00:48:19.560 --> 00:48:23.662]  And now he's doubled down since the boycott and he says they're white supremacists.
[00:48:23.702 --> 00:48:24.122]  That's right.
[00:48:24.422 --> 00:48:29.505]  Let me tell you, I've had crazy black cops, crazy Hispanic cops, crazy white cops.
[00:48:29.885 --> 00:48:30.966]  And I'm not stereotyping.
[00:48:30.986 --> 00:48:32.467]  My main problem has been female cops.
[00:48:32.727 --> 00:48:37.389]  There's been some cool ones too, but man, most of my problems have been with just chip on their shoulder.
[00:48:37.449 --> 00:48:39.150]  Female cops just want to get in my face.
[00:48:39.230 --> 00:48:39.911]  I'm a nice guy.
[00:48:40.771 --> 00:48:41.972]  Unless you're trampling on my rights.
[00:48:43.988 --> 00:48:48.732]  What we have is some jerks and control freaks that have been given murderous training.
[00:48:51.193 --> 00:48:51.854]  But here's the deal.
[00:48:52.174 --> 00:48:55.617]  Quentin Tarantino knows full well what he's doing.
[00:48:55.877 --> 00:49:08.767]  He is financed by the government through Hollywood, whether his films make money or not, a lot of them are losers now, to go out there and stand around with a bunch of sad black women who've lost their sons,
[00:49:12.216 --> 00:49:14.738]  And to basically push his film that's coming out.
[00:49:18.142 --> 00:49:18.983]  It's backfiring.
[00:49:19.063 --> 00:49:19.743]  He doesn't care.
[00:49:20.064 --> 00:49:20.965]  He knows his audience.
[00:49:21.305 --> 00:49:22.966]  He knows Hollywood and the White House back him.
[00:49:23.587 --> 00:49:27.891]  The same White House through Soros and Sharpton funding all this anti-cop stuff.
[00:49:28.232 --> 00:49:30.354]  It's all part of the weaponization of the media.
[00:49:31.752 --> 00:49:32.532]  But here's the good news.
[00:49:32.552 --> 00:49:36.133]  You know how I got the script of Machete three months before it came out?
[00:49:36.153 --> 00:49:38.454]  And then Rodriguez said that's not the script.
[00:49:38.494 --> 00:49:40.095]  Of course, it was the exact script.
[00:49:40.235 --> 00:49:42.115]  He lied in the Associated Press.
[00:49:43.856 --> 00:49:53.379]  I got it from a Hispanic person high up in his organization who thought it was extremely racist and who told me, oh, he's meeting with the White House.
[00:49:53.419 --> 00:49:54.720]  He's got a whole channel coming out.
[00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:56.160]  It's meant to create division.
[00:49:56.260 --> 00:49:56.740]  It's sick.
[00:49:56.760 --> 00:49:57.640]  That's all I can tell you.
[00:49:57.981 --> 00:49:59.021]  I can't tell you more.
[00:50:04.650 --> 00:50:10.555]  Because the average Hispanic person sits around in a boardroom hearing about getting people to fight with each other and gets very upset.
[00:50:10.775 --> 00:50:11.576]  This is sick!
[00:50:12.036 --> 00:50:12.977]  This is evil!
[00:50:13.758 --> 00:50:15.840]  This is premeditated warfare.
[00:50:16.720 --> 00:50:20.283]  And Lord knows there's some bad cops out there that deserve punishment.
[00:50:20.624 --> 00:50:22.806]  And they get away with a lot of stuff in corrupt jurisdictions.
[00:50:22.846 --> 00:50:27.970]  But man, let me tell you, the globalists don't want to start a war with the police to help this country or get justice.
[00:50:28.250 --> 00:50:32.354]  They want to burn this country down just like they did Ukraine to bring in tyranny.
[00:50:33.612 --> 00:50:35.633]  And they'll use any factions they can to do it.
[00:50:40.077 --> 00:50:42.058]  Quentin Tarantino walked over to me one time.
[00:50:42.759 --> 00:50:44.019]  I went and saw The French Connection.
[00:50:44.039 --> 00:50:46.121]  There's also The Exorcist that was showing after him.
[00:50:46.141 --> 00:50:47.102]  It's the same director.
[00:50:47.122 --> 00:50:49.123]  And I was a fan of The French Connection.
[00:50:49.143 --> 00:50:53.906]  So I went and saw it, and Tarantino marched over to me.
[00:50:53.926 --> 00:50:56.328]  I said, what are you doing here?
[00:50:56.969 --> 00:50:59.651]  I said, just, just, and stomped off.
[00:50:59.751 --> 00:51:01.472]  I mean, just, just, just talk about
[00:51:03.007 --> 00:51:04.314]  The guy's really a no-talent.
[00:51:04.435 --> 00:51:05.902]  He made one good movie, Pulp Fiction.
[00:51:05.942 --> 00:51:07.108]  I mean, he really is a joke.
[00:51:11.621 --> 00:51:15.842]  Earthquake, floods, winter storms, prolonged power outages, or war.
[00:51:16.242 --> 00:51:19.982]  Each of us have had that moment when we recognize that we need to be better prepared.
[00:51:20.523 --> 00:51:21.783]  We typically do the same thing.
[00:51:21.903 --> 00:51:24.463]  We start with food storage, then we address the need for water.
[00:51:24.943 --> 00:51:26.564]  But have you considered heat storage?
[00:51:27.144 --> 00:51:28.944]  I'm talking about staying warm in the cold.
[00:51:29.364 --> 00:51:31.024]  Here are some things for you to consider.
[00:51:31.644 --> 00:51:33.025]  How will I keep my family warm?
[00:51:33.285 --> 00:51:35.745]  The standard answers are firewood, coal, or propane.
[00:51:35.765 --> 00:51:39.826]  But the problem with that, if you need to be on the move, is you can't take it with you.
[00:51:40.666 --> 00:51:41.367]  Another concern?
[00:51:41.767 --> 00:51:45.450]  There may come a time when you need to stay warm without smoke, like in times of war.
[00:51:45.750 --> 00:51:48.012]  There may even come a time when you can't burn fuel.
[00:51:48.352 --> 00:51:51.535]  The answers may be simpler and less costly than you think.
[00:51:52.316 --> 00:51:54.778]  For these answers, go to FortressClothing.com.
[00:51:55.138 --> 00:51:59.101]  Again, FortressClothing.com has the answers to your heat storage dilemma.
[00:51:59.782 --> 00:52:01.123]  Don't get stuck in the cold.

[00:52:03.425 --> 00:52:04.786]  You'll never be cold again.

[00:52:42.291 --> 00:52:45.774]  This isn't a game, and let me tell you, the results are dramatic.

[00:52:50.078 --> 00:52:53.941]  But that said, you need to consult your physician before you do the full detox.

[00:53:08.467 --> 00:53:21.015]  Atmospheric Aluminum, Mercury Exposure, Estrogen Toxins from Plastics, Microwaves from Cell Phones and Smart Meters, and Low Quality Foods, all combined to create conditions for the very high incidence of disease in our society.
[00:53:21.335 --> 00:53:29.720]  Now more than ever, we all need to be consuming those foods and herbs that epigenetically signal the cells of our body to produce energy, create proteins, and detoxify.
[00:53:29.860 --> 00:53:35.463]  When we properly support our bodies, then even in these toxic times, we can promote and achieve excellent health.
[00:53:35.864 --> 00:53:38.145]  One World Way is the first energetically encoded,
[00:53:38.465 --> 00:53:39.065]  I think so.
[00:54:17.603 --> 00:54:19.365]  Pancho needs your prayers, it's true.
[00:54:20.466 --> 00:54:21.807]  Save a few for Lefty, too.
[00:54:22.768 --> 00:54:24.229]  He only did what he had to do.
[00:54:25.130 --> 00:54:29.834]  And now he's grown old.
[00:54:33.457 --> 00:54:35.980]  Living on the road, my friend.
[00:54:37.202 --> 00:54:40.745]  1-800-259-9231 800-259-9231 That's the toll free number to join us.
[00:54:40.825 --> 00:54:44.348]  We'll take your calls in the next 30 minutes, an hour.
[00:54:44.388 --> 00:54:47.690]  Then former Congressman Ron Paul joins us, yet again.
[00:54:47.750 --> 00:54:49.592]  He's been coming on for 20 years.
[00:55:04.705 --> 00:55:08.807]  This has got to be the best Willie Nelson song.
[00:55:10.348 --> 00:55:13.370]  He's got Will Hagert as well.
[00:55:14.050 --> 00:55:15.971]  It's a Van Zant song.
[00:55:16.051 --> 00:55:17.972]  Love the great Texan.
[00:55:25.141 --> 00:55:28.822]  Pancho met his match, you know.
[00:55:29.422 --> 00:55:32.563]  On the deserts down in Mexico.
[00:55:33.343 --> 00:55:34.304]  Alright, gotta shut it off.
[00:55:34.344 --> 00:55:36.684]  It's hard to do.
[00:55:36.764 --> 00:55:38.385]  Ooh, but that's the way it goes.
[00:55:43.591 --> 00:55:48.395]  I gotta cover this coming up in the next hour, but not because it's about me, but because it shows enemy operations.
[00:55:48.995 --> 00:55:59.122]  And it shows people preying on their audiences, preying on their viewers and listeners with hateful conceit and just twisted bad will.
[00:56:00.884 --> 00:56:08.990]  Bill Maher put Infowars.com up during his news segment
[00:56:10.003 --> 00:56:19.494]  And put a fake headline on it saying that cancer is good for you and that it's a conspiracy that cancer is bad for you.
[00:56:22.998 --> 00:56:24.560]  Now this isn't even really subliminal.
[00:56:26.017 --> 00:56:39.009]  We've caught HBO, we've caught CNN, Fox News, Comedy Central doing similar things where they'll flash up my name and say pedophile or flash up my image and say sex predator.
[00:56:39.029 --> 00:56:41.951]  I mean this is hardcore warfare.
[00:56:41.991 --> 00:56:44.333]  This is the CIA being taking the gloves off.
[00:56:45.514 --> 00:56:52.481]  Remember Comedy Central show chides InfoWars with clone website that says Michael Jackson lives
[00:56:55.100 --> 00:56:58.601]  In a mansion on a space station with Richard Branson.
[00:57:00.082 --> 00:57:04.964]  And that's not as bad as O'Reilly saying we're going to fight sex predators and restrict the internet freedom and that shows a picture of me.
[00:57:05.724 --> 00:57:07.044]  I mean, I'm not a sex offender.
[00:57:07.104 --> 00:57:08.405]  I've never been charged with anything.
[00:57:08.745 --> 00:57:10.266]  I could win a lawsuit against News Corp.
[00:57:10.706 --> 00:57:11.366]  But they don't care.
[00:57:13.927 --> 00:57:14.487]  But you know what?
[00:57:14.587 --> 00:57:16.428]  We're going to expose you and that's what matters.
[00:57:17.408 --> 00:57:19.629]  But now Bill Maher, HBO's done it again.
[00:57:20.947 --> 00:57:28.013]  They actually put InfoWars.com and then have it say on the screen, cancer bad for you or government hoax.
[00:57:29.595 --> 00:57:32.538]  And he's going through news pieces, some real, some not here.
[00:57:33.939 --> 00:57:35.380]  This is beyond yellow journalism.
[00:57:35.400 --> 00:57:36.681]  Alright, I'm going to stop right there.
[00:57:37.822 --> 00:57:40.104]  Folks, we're reaching hundreds of millions of people.
[00:57:40.976 --> 00:57:41.556]  Every few months.
[00:57:41.577 --> 00:57:42.797]  That's why the enemy's coming after us.
[00:57:42.817 --> 00:57:44.719]  You need to keep spreading the word about the broadcast.
[00:57:44.999 --> 00:57:46.080]  Tell more people about it.
[00:57:46.940 --> 00:57:48.982]  Support our local sponsors and buy the products.
[00:57:49.022 --> 00:57:55.547]  Because we've got audience, but funding we need for more reporters, more writers, legal, you name it, we're under attack.
[00:57:56.447 --> 00:57:57.748]  We need your prayers more importantly.
[00:57:58.429 --> 00:58:00.210]  We got 25% off Brain Force.
[00:58:00.230 --> 00:58:00.971]  Go read the reviews.
[00:58:01.111 --> 00:58:04.293]  It is, from our research and what I believe to be the ultimate brain pill.
[00:58:04.694 --> 00:58:06.175]  It's got stuff that's prescription in Europe.
[00:58:07.356 --> 00:58:10.857]  I mean, you want Pick Me Up, that is the real deal, and Focus Thinking.
[00:58:11.437 --> 00:58:14.078]  The problem is, it does make me more aggressive, but I'm just naturally aggressive.
[00:58:14.098 --> 00:58:15.638]  It kind of magnifies my personality.
[00:58:15.918 --> 00:58:17.419]  And I did take one this morning.
[00:58:17.439 --> 00:58:19.679]  I don't take it every day, and I'm bouncing off the walls.
[00:58:20.160 --> 00:58:21.920]  Super Metal Vitality's back in stock.

[00:58:28.102 --> 00:58:30.282]  Because we are on them.
[00:58:30.322 --> 00:58:31.102]  We are hurting them.
[00:58:31.303 --> 00:58:32.783]  We're going to go on exposing them.
[00:58:33.982 --> 00:58:35.963]  We need your support.

[00:58:52.829 --> 00:58:53.889]  We need the war funding.
[00:58:54.229 --> 00:58:54.870]  We're committed.
[00:58:55.010 --> 00:58:55.310]  Are you?

[01:00:00.784 --> 01:00:03.354]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:14.864 --> 01:00:15.504]  Big Brother.
[01:00:16.165 --> 01:00:17.186]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:17.946 --> 01:00:19.027]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:19.707 --> 01:00:20.508]  You want answers?
[01:00:21.288 --> 01:00:22.169]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:22.830 --> 01:00:26.452]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:27.032 --> 01:00:31.115]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:32.396 --> 01:00:40.522]  Niko, during a break earlier, said, hey, Alex, why aren't you covering that the Obama administration, after four weeks after it passed globally,
[01:00:42.827 --> 01:00:45.049]  Has now released the text of the TPP trade deal.
[01:00:45.069 --> 01:00:49.052]  We've got it up on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:00:49.072 --> 01:00:51.174]  It's also in the center column of DrudgeReport.com.
[01:00:51.875 --> 01:00:53.536]  Details of Obama trade released.
[01:00:54.337 --> 01:00:56.859]  30 chapters.
[01:00:56.879 --> 01:00:58.540]  2,000 plus pages.
[01:01:01.002 --> 01:01:05.706]  And we're linking there in the article to the PDFs.
[01:01:05.726 --> 01:01:07.728]  100 plus different PDF documents.
[01:01:09.173 --> 01:01:09.713]  Incredible.
[01:01:10.294 --> 01:01:11.755]  And we only had three sections before.
[01:01:11.795 --> 01:01:12.595]  It was nightmarish.
[01:01:12.635 --> 01:01:26.183]  So, guaranteed, in the next few days and tonight with the Nightly News, I know David Knight's hosting the fourth hour, we're going to be digging through all of this, bringing you the details of the nightmare.
[01:01:32.907 --> 01:01:35.269]  Now, continuing, ladies and gentlemen,
[01:01:36.263 --> 01:01:37.543]  I want to go to your phone calls.
[01:01:37.563 --> 01:01:44.165]  I also want to air the former U.S.
[01:01:44.245 --> 01:01:46.686]  Ambassador to the U.N.
[01:01:47.366 --> 01:01:50.747]  saying that Russia's response, he believes, is going to be really big.
[01:01:51.487 --> 01:01:52.588]  That is coming up.
[01:01:54.068 --> 01:01:57.429]  And I want to take your phone calls, obviously discussing the Russian plane.
[01:01:57.469 --> 01:01:59.490]  They're now saying a bomb or a missile, probably a bomb.
[01:02:00.905 --> 01:02:03.907]  By ISIS and the West is acting like their feelings are hurt for Russia.
[01:02:04.428 --> 01:02:08.491]  This is a proxy army.
[01:02:09.852 --> 01:02:11.053]  So where do you see this going?
[01:02:13.195 --> 01:02:20.461]  We've got Habbo in Wisconsin, Bill in Wisconsin, Doug in Minnesota, Rock in Minnesota, John in Texas, and others.
[01:02:21.501 --> 01:02:25.725]  Let's go ahead and talk to Bill in Wisconsin.
[01:02:25.745 --> 01:02:26.445]  You're on the air, Bill.
[01:02:26.465 --> 01:02:27.026]  Thanks for calling.
[01:02:27.901 --> 01:02:29.461]  Yeah, Alex, how you been?
[01:02:29.781 --> 01:02:31.822]  It's been a while since I've called in.
[01:02:31.842 --> 01:02:33.162]  Good to hear from you.
[01:02:33.602 --> 01:02:40.403]  Yeah, and you played that information by the neocon John Bolton.
[01:02:41.164 --> 01:02:45.004]  I think we gotta look at the total international picture here.
[01:02:46.485 --> 01:02:50.865]  Automatically, the Western nations are saying ISIS blew it up.
[01:02:51.806 --> 01:02:53.546]  And that makes me suspicious.
[01:02:54.441 --> 01:02:54.901]  Okay.
[01:02:56.462 --> 01:03:00.064]  I think we could have British intelligence.
[01:03:01.385 --> 01:03:04.567]  I think we could have Mossad.
[01:03:05.267 --> 01:03:08.689]  I think we have a lot of players in this mix.
[01:03:09.650 --> 01:03:23.258]  What bothers me about ISIS the most is that here we have a group of jihadi extremists that are attacking
[01:03:24.253 --> 01:03:30.675]  Arab countries, but are leaving Israel completely off the radar.
[01:03:31.635 --> 01:03:44.919]  Now, wouldn't you think that they would want to cause great harm to the state of Israel and to the Jews in the world?
[01:03:44.939 --> 01:03:49.460]  Well sure, but the Saudi Arabians basically run Al-Qaeda.
[01:03:50.549 --> 01:04:01.975]  And ISIS, and they're not attacking Israel because Saudi Arabia is allied with Israel, and in the South, and in the Golan, Israel is actually backing Syrian rebels.
[01:04:02.015 --> 01:04:03.235]  That's on record.
[01:04:03.896 --> 01:04:04.776]  It's despicable, too.
[01:04:06.337 --> 01:04:17.423]  So, we shouldn't automatically say, okay, ISIS did it, when I think there's some strings being pulled in the background, and of course,
[01:04:18.672 --> 01:04:30.054]  You know, myself in Wisconsin, I can't prove this, but I get the same kind of sense having watched some of this over 30, 40 years.
[01:04:30.854 --> 01:04:32.114]  And that's all I'm saying.
[01:04:32.775 --> 01:04:44.497]  Well, I think what you say is 100% legitimate and should be investigated, because all these governments, whether it's Israel, England, the United States, have all been caught staging false flags and blaming it on people.
[01:04:45.277 --> 01:04:46.057]  The difference is,
[01:04:48.397 --> 01:04:49.799]  ISIS doesn't care if they get blamed.
[01:04:50.019 --> 01:04:51.020]  They're already under attack.
[01:04:52.081 --> 01:04:55.465]  They would have the motive to strike at Russia to say, leave us alone.
[01:04:56.646 --> 01:04:57.427]  That's all I'm saying.
[01:04:57.787 --> 01:04:58.688]  I don't think we know yet.
[01:04:59.269 --> 01:05:01.131]  I think it's clear, though, that it didn't blow up on its own.
[01:05:01.852 --> 01:05:03.914]  Habu and others, your calls are straight ahead.
[01:05:04.014 --> 01:05:04.455]  Stay with us.
[01:05:08.965 --> 01:05:11.686]  You're racist if you attack Planned Parenthood.
[01:05:11.867 --> 01:05:14.468]  That's according to feminist icon Gloria Steinem.
[01:05:14.828 --> 01:05:26.554]  Steinem claims the current backlash against Planned Parenthood is part of an ultra right-wing attempt to restore the basis of patriarchy, a long-term racist system which is controlling reproduction.
[01:05:26.914 --> 01:05:30.497]  And to control reproduction, you have to control the bodies of women.
[01:05:30.857 --> 01:05:35.020]  What kind of inverted reality is this CIA-connected activist living in?
[01:05:35.280 --> 01:05:42.485]  Contrary to all those social justice buzzwords, Planned Parenthood was founded by a self-described racist.
[01:05:42.545 --> 01:05:51.151]  Founder Margaret Sanger famously said in 1939, we don't want the word to go out, that we want to exterminate the Negro population.
[01:05:51.471 --> 01:05:57.920]  Planned Parenthood was founded to control the bodies of black women in order to control the black population.
[01:05:58.280 --> 01:06:03.407]  If you can wade through all of Steinem's doublespeak, you might just figure out who the real racists are.

[01:09:09.249 --> 01:09:15.556]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:09:17.979 --> 01:09:24.826]  Just look at some of the insane headlines at Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, and some of these on DrudgeReport.com.
[01:09:26.577 --> 01:09:30.940]  Family hires attorney after school punishes girl for hugging classmate.

[01:09:42.868 --> 01:09:43.749]  Walking's not allowed.
[01:09:44.369 --> 01:09:45.490]  It's total prison behavior.
[01:09:45.510 --> 01:09:46.811]  People like us prisoners get recess.
[01:09:47.291 --> 01:09:50.153]  A student waving stapler leads to school lockdown.
[01:09:50.554 --> 01:09:51.875]  Major police response.
[01:09:52.975 --> 01:09:57.819]  460,000 plus drug overdoses kill more Americans a year than car crashes.
[01:09:59.101 --> 01:10:00.942]  And cops don't even kill a thousand people a year.
[01:10:01.262 --> 01:10:03.224]  But the number one issue is the cops are killing everyone.
[01:10:03.464 --> 01:10:04.805]  The cops, the cops, the cops.
[01:10:04.845 --> 01:10:06.847]  That's only meant for destabilization.
[01:10:09.129 --> 01:10:11.631]  Again, I'm not endorsing bad cops or federalization.
[01:10:11.951 --> 01:10:13.673]  I'm just saying this is part of a larger plan.
[01:10:15.140 --> 01:10:15.821]  City of hate.
[01:10:15.881 --> 01:10:19.704]  Mom breastfeeding baby mugged at knife point in Manhattan Park.
[01:10:19.864 --> 01:10:20.304]  Whoa!

[01:10:53.859 --> 01:10:56.821]  Woman spontaneously combust on park bench.
[01:10:57.793 --> 01:10:59.695]  Wow, that happens every year or so.
[01:10:59.715 --> 01:11:01.016]  It's usually women, too.
[01:11:01.056 --> 01:11:03.417]  They just blow up like space aliens shot them or something.
[01:11:04.138 --> 01:11:06.840]  The Great Global Warming Scare has now been exposed.
[01:11:06.960 --> 01:11:08.121]  Arctic ice growing.
[01:11:08.562 --> 01:11:10.863]  Massive magma chamber found below Mount St.
[01:11:10.883 --> 01:11:11.184]  Helens.
[01:11:11.244 --> 01:11:12.104]  It could blow again.
[01:11:12.525 --> 01:11:13.906]  Creepier than Google glasses.
[01:11:13.966 --> 01:11:15.127]  A third eye in the middle of your head.
[01:11:15.507 --> 01:11:20.091]  Researchers grow grain parts to study development and disease in the brain.
[01:11:20.111 --> 01:11:24.154]  That's just some of the news.
[01:11:26.618 --> 01:11:35.781]  And then now they've released the TPP four weeks after it was negotiated for two years, and then secretly agreed to four weeks and a day later.
[01:11:39.462 --> 01:11:46.844]  They now have released it, but it looks like, we've been looking over, it looks like all of it's not there, there's confusion, there's over a hundred PDFs.
[01:11:49.145 --> 01:11:50.625]  We will be ferreting into that.
[01:11:52.830 --> 01:11:53.992]  You can certainly believe it.
[01:11:54.012 --> 01:11:54.973]  I want to go to your phone calls.
[01:11:55.013 --> 01:11:55.915]  Ron Paul's coming up.
[01:11:56.215 --> 01:12:05.189]  We are live, ladies and gentlemen, and David Knight will be hosting the new fourth hour that we've added to the show, the overdrive, the latest news, the recap, the...
[01:12:06.889 --> 01:12:07.870]  You want more, you got it.
[01:12:08.591 --> 01:12:09.832]  Fourth hour of the InfoWar.
[01:12:10.072 --> 01:12:13.996]  Three hours with Alex Jones, fourth hour with the rest of our great crew and reporters.
[01:12:14.016 --> 01:12:15.597]  And sometimes I host the fourth hour as well.
[01:12:15.898 --> 01:12:17.479]  The Nightly News is seven o'clock tonight.
[01:12:18.080 --> 01:12:22.604]  You know, Lee and McAdoo went and reported live with Josh Owens up outside St.
[01:12:22.624 --> 01:12:25.427]  Louis at a giant burning landfill underground.
[01:12:26.553 --> 01:12:27.955]  That has radioactive waste in it.
[01:12:28.535 --> 01:12:30.658]  Massive birth defects and deaths in the area.
[01:12:31.398 --> 01:12:33.040]  And the government just says everything's fine.
[01:12:33.441 --> 01:12:38.046]  Tonight we will air part one of our interview with poison kids of Coldwater Creek.
[01:12:38.506 --> 01:12:39.107]  Victims of St.
[01:12:39.127 --> 01:12:41.750]  Louis nuclear legacy discuss their youth.
[01:12:43.876 --> 01:12:50.717]  Innocently playing in the beautiful creek that would one day lead to their deaths, cancers, and deformities of multiple generations.
[01:12:50.757 --> 01:12:55.098]  The Poisoned Kids of Coldwater Creek serve as a warning of what could befall the city of St.
[01:12:55.118 --> 01:12:59.539]  Louis if the remnants of the war are left lurking in a smoldering landfill.
[01:13:00.339 --> 01:13:06.140]  This is a real state of emergency as Manhattan Project waste was secretly dumped in many cities throughout the nation, not just St.
[01:13:06.160 --> 01:13:06.420]  Louis.
[01:13:06.540 --> 01:13:10.041]  All Americans deserve to know if they too have been exposed to nuclear radiation.
[01:13:11.784 --> 01:13:13.445]  Well, I don't know, Leanne.
[01:13:15.025 --> 01:13:16.746]  Maybe you're being racist against radiation.
[01:13:16.766 --> 01:13:18.446]  Maybe it's good for you.
[01:13:19.507 --> 01:13:24.748]  We heard that the kids out by Fukushima should be thankful that they live near radiation.
[01:13:24.768 --> 01:13:25.989]  That it's good for them.
[01:13:27.349 --> 01:13:29.770]  Now that their thyroid cancers are up about a thousand percent.
[01:13:30.750 --> 01:13:31.731]  And they admit it's killing them.
[01:13:32.131 --> 01:13:33.191]  And the butterflies are dying.
[01:13:33.211 --> 01:13:34.252]  And the plants are mutating.
[01:13:34.272 --> 01:13:37.513]  But that's okay.
[01:13:38.973 --> 01:13:41.094]  Because we're going to put in transgender bathrooms.
[01:13:43.117 --> 01:13:43.777]  That's okay.
[01:13:44.398 --> 01:13:46.639]  It's okay if the inoculations are causing cancer.
[01:13:46.699 --> 01:13:48.439]  It's okay if they're causing neurological disorders.
[01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:49.680]  It's okay.
[01:13:50.400 --> 01:13:52.301]  We got a handicap ramp here at the office.
[01:13:53.462 --> 01:13:53.662]  See?
[01:13:55.823 --> 01:13:57.744]  Gouge your eyeballs out and give you a cane.
[01:13:59.345 --> 01:14:02.226]  Take your job away and give you a welfare check barely enough to live.
[01:14:05.285 --> 01:14:06.326]  Talk about police state.
[01:14:06.406 --> 01:14:10.330]  State law makes it a felony to touch a police officer, even off duty and out of uniform.
[01:14:10.850 --> 01:14:15.034]  Extends the cloak of qualified immunity to cover every aspect of law enforcement officer's life.
[01:14:15.555 --> 01:14:17.396]  Yeah, and that just adds to the arrogancy.
[01:14:18.117 --> 01:14:19.158]  William Gregg writes on that.
[01:14:19.178 --> 01:14:19.879]  We should get him on.
[01:14:21.781 --> 01:14:22.641]  Very scary stuff.
[01:14:23.547 --> 01:14:31.172]  And again, the government wants more power, but then it's going to scapegoat its minions when the public gets mad at them, and make the whole revolution just about going after them.
[01:14:31.192 --> 01:14:32.353]  That's why I hammer that.
[01:14:33.054 --> 01:14:38.017]  But I want to go to your phone calls, Habu and others, before I do that, here is John Bolton, the former head U.S.
[01:14:38.718 --> 01:14:49.265]  envoy to the U.N., the guy that made up the WMD garbage, he's one of the chief people, but he says Russia, he expects a really strong response, an extraordinary massive, was the word he used,
[01:14:50.666 --> 01:14:54.049]  Are they trying to sucker the Russians into an even bigger war in a new Afghanistan?
[01:14:56.871 --> 01:15:01.595]  Yeah, I think the new world order's got some tricks up its sleeve, but the world isn't as ignorant as it was back then.
[01:15:01.635 --> 01:15:08.360]  We know the tricks, but that doesn't mean that they won't succeed unless we get the word out.
[01:15:08.380 --> 01:15:08.980]  Let's go to this clip.
[01:15:16.772 --> 01:15:18.052]  Back that up, who does he look like?
[01:15:18.072 --> 01:15:21.333]  He looks like some cartoon character, but I can't exactly place it.
[01:15:23.894 --> 01:15:25.514]  He looks like a brush mop.
[01:15:25.534 --> 01:15:32.736]  I mean, I'm not knocking his mustache, it's just that hair and that whole, it's like the Mad Scientist game or something.
[01:15:32.756 --> 01:15:34.376]  Is there a Mad Scientist game that kids play?
[01:15:34.396 --> 01:15:36.597]  I've seen the cover of it, it shows a mad scientist on the cover.
[01:15:37.497 --> 01:15:39.358]  I'm sorry, I'm not trying to like make fun of how he looks.
[01:15:40.098 --> 01:15:42.418]  Imagine if you crossed him with Hillary, what it would look like.
[01:15:43.579 --> 01:15:43.919]  Look like a...
[01:15:46.471 --> 01:15:47.291]  A space alien?
[01:15:48.311 --> 01:15:48.752]  Alright, I'm sorry.
[01:15:48.772 --> 01:15:49.452]  Let's go back to the clip.
[01:15:49.492 --> 01:15:50.772]  Here it is.
[01:15:51.072 --> 01:15:51.872]  Good evening, sir.
[01:15:52.172 --> 01:15:56.533]  And, you know, maybe this is a wake-up call to Putin.
[01:15:56.773 --> 01:15:57.674]  Oh yeah, back it up.
[01:15:57.694 --> 01:15:58.314]  Back it up to start.
[01:15:58.334 --> 01:15:58.834]  I'm sorry.
[01:15:58.894 --> 01:16:01.094]  Yeah, I watched this last night.
[01:16:01.114 --> 01:16:06.396]  I happened to be watching Fox and then obviously we had it on the website this morning.
[01:16:06.816 --> 01:16:07.736]  Infowars.com.
[01:16:10.216 --> 01:16:11.937]  But it just, it just clicked for me.
[01:16:12.884 --> 01:16:22.049]  Watching it, Greta Van Susteren is really either super ignorant or is one of the biggest liars I've ever seen in her bash Russia rhetoric.
[01:16:22.309 --> 01:16:24.950]  Because she keeps saying, why won't Russia do something about ISIS?
[01:16:25.511 --> 01:16:28.052]  Why won't Russia stand up and join us fighting Al Qaeda?
[01:16:30.313 --> 01:16:34.575]  And Bolton knows it's an international stage and he goes, well actually, they are.
[01:16:35.276 --> 01:16:39.398]  Well actually, I mean, Greta Van Susteren is either totally stupid,
[01:16:41.221 --> 01:16:43.466]  Or it wins the BSR Award of 2015.
[01:16:44.047 --> 01:16:44.748]  Let's go back to the club.
[01:16:45.692 --> 01:16:46.773]  United States Ambassador, U.N.
[01:16:46.813 --> 01:16:48.534]  Ambassador, John Bolton goes on the record.
[01:16:48.814 --> 01:16:49.614]  Good evening, sir.
[01:16:49.915 --> 01:16:55.458]  And, you know, maybe this is a wake-up call to Putin about ISIS.
[01:16:55.518 --> 01:16:57.019]  I mean, you know, this is an attack.
[01:16:57.439 --> 01:16:59.880]  All their citizens, much like our citizens, got attacked.
[01:17:00.020 --> 01:17:01.021]  They had lost 244.
[01:17:01.081 --> 01:17:01.841]  We lost 3,000.
[01:17:01.941 --> 01:17:03.702]  About the same geography.
[01:17:03.923 --> 01:17:06.304]  Now he will see ISIS as the threat it is.
[01:17:06.564 --> 01:17:09.366]  Well, I don't think he's ever doubted that ISIS is a threat.
[01:17:09.626 --> 01:17:11.587]  Back it up 10 seconds.
[01:17:12.287 --> 01:17:14.629]  They invaded Syria to take out ISIS.
[01:17:17.111 --> 01:17:20.774]  I mean, this is a total upside-down inversion of reality we talk about here.
[01:17:21.835 --> 01:17:23.796]  And then she keeps saying it as a talking point.
[01:17:24.216 --> 01:17:26.478]  This is who they put on television?
[01:17:27.779 --> 01:17:30.341]  She's the type of prosecutor to put innocent people in prison, in my view.
[01:17:33.623 --> 01:17:35.945]  And man, is she an example of bad plastic surgery.
[01:17:36.005 --> 01:17:41.149]  I'm not talking about how she looks, but I mean, who are these weird snapping turtle people?
[01:17:41.629 --> 01:17:44.131]  Maybe they're really aliens wearing rubber masks or something.
[01:17:44.151 --> 01:17:46.173]  Man, it looks like she's wearing a rubber mask.
[01:17:47.486 --> 01:17:52.391]  And I'm not just kidding how she looks, but I mean, what she says, it's just, why do you insult us?
[01:17:52.432 --> 01:17:55.235]  But then I realize, she's got a bunch of adult viewers.
[01:17:56.276 --> 01:17:58.418]  Drinking Diet Coke, don't know what planet they're on.
[01:17:59.239 --> 01:18:00.821]  Go back to it, just go back to it.
[01:18:02.034 --> 01:18:03.815]  They lost 244, we lost 3,000.
[01:18:04.755 --> 01:18:07.876]  But maybe now he will see ISIS as the threat it is.
[01:18:08.336 --> 01:18:13.798]  I don't think he's ever doubted that ISIS is a threat, particularly deep inside Russia itself.
[01:18:13.918 --> 01:18:18.119]  I think his objective in Syria was to bolster the Assad regime.
[01:18:18.179 --> 01:18:26.341]  But if it turns out that ISIS is responsible for downing this plane, that is the single biggest mistake they have ever made.
[01:18:26.421 --> 01:18:28.802]  Because Putin now will retaliate.
[01:18:29.162 --> 01:18:32.145]  And he won't mess around like President Obama has done.
[01:18:32.565 --> 01:18:35.948]  It will be, I think, extraordinarily massive.
[01:18:36.248 --> 01:18:41.213]  And I think he needs to do that for a number of reasons, including his domestic political calculus.
[01:18:54.110 --> 01:18:57.852]  And then to John, Tom, Doug, and Charlene and others.
[01:18:57.872 --> 01:18:58.773]  I'm going to get to all of you.
[01:18:59.674 --> 01:19:03.876]  And then Ron Paul's only coming on for like 10 minutes with some campaign news, so I'll go right back to your calls after that.
[01:19:05.257 --> 01:19:19.106]  We've now got subliminal messages all over TV, just the ones we're catching are all over, where I'm a sexual abuser of women, I'm a drug dealer, and I say cancer is good for you.
[01:19:21.345 --> 01:19:29.191]  The latest is they actually dummied up an article from Infowars and reported it on Bill Maher, I have the video, as if we actually said this.
[01:19:32.633 --> 01:19:38.778]  I mean... Bill Maher literally thinks his audience are idiots.
[01:19:45.923 --> 01:19:48.625]  You know, Bill Maher would get record ratings if I came on his show.
[01:19:49.246 --> 01:19:49.786]  And he knows that.
[01:19:50.953 --> 01:19:52.694]  They know that every show I go on, it's huge ratings.
[01:19:53.194 --> 01:19:54.175]  Big, big national news.
[01:19:54.855 --> 01:19:55.195]  He won't.
[01:19:55.256 --> 01:19:58.638]  So I'll tell him, shut up with his pre-written lines.
[01:19:59.598 --> 01:20:00.519]  And listen to reality.
[01:20:02.260 --> 01:20:03.360]  I'd like to slap him.
[01:20:03.720 --> 01:20:04.621]  He didn't even take the punch.
[01:20:04.681 --> 01:20:07.463]  I'd just backhand him right up, just right in his nose.
[01:20:08.692 --> 01:20:11.995]  So you've got to take a state construction license exam or certification.
[01:20:12.135 --> 01:20:14.437]  Can't decide on what books or what chapters to study?

[01:21:08.323 --> 01:21:09.705]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[01:21:09.985 --> 01:21:11.267]  You can't survive without it.
[01:21:11.467 --> 01:21:12.368]  But where do you get it?
[01:21:12.688 --> 01:21:18.435]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new, groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.
[01:21:18.675 --> 01:21:24.382]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.

[01:21:41.878 --> 01:21:44.840]  As if chlorine in our water weren't bad enough, now they're adding ammonia?
[01:22:12.218 --> 01:22:12.718]  It's true.
[01:22:12.838 --> 01:22:16.799]  Some municipalities are now adding ammonia plus chlorine to your water supply.
[01:22:16.980 --> 01:22:18.860]  It's a disinfectant called chloramine.
[01:22:19.380 --> 01:22:23.861]  But with a trusted Big Berkey water filter, you can keep chloramine out of your water.
[01:22:24.162 --> 01:22:32.664]  New NSF EPA certified lab tests show EPA Berkey water filters remove chloramines, pharmaceuticals, BPA, pesticides,
[01:22:32.864 --> 01:22:36.766]  Bacteria and viruses, all forms of fluoride, and much more.

[01:22:47.793 --> 01:22:48.413]  Big Berkey.
[01:22:48.614 --> 01:22:52.116]  The one that's powerful enough to purify stagnant pond water.

[01:23:37.125 --> 01:23:39.887]  My dad was 59 when he collapsed from a heart attack late last year.
[01:23:40.187 --> 01:23:42.788]  Just this past August was when we spread his ashes on the St.
[01:23:42.808 --> 01:23:43.249]  Croix River.
[01:23:43.569 --> 01:23:44.209]  I loved my dad.
[01:23:44.610 --> 01:23:45.570]  The boy was too stubborn.
[01:23:45.790 --> 01:23:48.512]  He hadn't been to the doctor in over 25 years.
[01:23:48.752 --> 01:23:49.272]  His excuse?
[01:23:49.633 --> 01:23:50.693]  He simply couldn't afford it.
[01:23:50.973 --> 01:23:52.254]  He wasn't a rich man by any means.
[01:23:52.574 --> 01:23:58.078]  At less than $107 per month, LibertyOnCall.org would have been the perfect alternative for my father.
[01:23:58.338 --> 01:23:59.078]  Don't wait.
[01:23:59.378 --> 01:24:01.740]  Go to LibertyOnCall.org right now.
[01:24:02.040 --> 01:24:04.281]  For not just your sake, but for the sake of your loved ones.
[01:24:04.522 --> 01:24:06.123]  Again, that's LibertyOnCall.org.
[01:24:08.957 --> 01:24:23.549]  I want to get at least two calls in from Habu and John in this segment, then Ron Paul's popping in, then I'll go to Doug and others.
[01:24:23.869 --> 01:24:25.491]  Habu in Wisconsin, you're on the air.
[01:24:25.791 --> 01:24:34.218]  What's your take on the shoot-down of the airliner, which they now admit was an act of terrorism, basically?
[01:24:34.418 --> 01:24:35.599]  Thank you for the opportunity.
[01:24:36.936 --> 01:24:44.643]  I believe that's correct, and that's what I thought even before they mentioned it, because of the way that the news came out.
[01:24:44.663 --> 01:24:48.206]  But here's the important point.
[01:24:50.128 --> 01:25:02.339]  You know, when you look at the logistics around a plane, meaning all these people coming, as you alluded to earlier, you know, food service, pack, you know, servicing it, bringing in all the luggage, etc.
[01:25:03.666 --> 01:25:07.349]  Plus cleaning out the passenger area.
[01:25:08.029 --> 01:25:12.932]  It is so easy to really smuggle, you know, a kind of a bomb device in there.
[01:25:13.552 --> 01:25:29.002]  And so, by my way of thinking, they don't even need, you know, these expensive shoulder missiles or something of that sort, because they do have inside, you know, contacts with people.
[01:25:29.282 --> 01:25:31.183]  And just think of it, a guy who's making $500 a month
[01:25:32.754 --> 01:25:35.457]  And they give him a million dollar bounty.
[01:25:35.477 --> 01:25:38.881]  You know, it's very clear which way the person's going to go.
[01:25:40.285 --> 01:25:40.805]  That's right.
[01:25:41.066 --> 01:25:45.428]  And these radicals funded by different Western intelligence agencies will do anything.
[01:25:45.468 --> 01:25:47.190]  And they all have connections.
[01:25:47.530 --> 01:25:54.575]  So whether the West gave the orders to ISIS to do this or Al-Qaeda to do this, and they're the prime suspects, it doesn't matter.
[01:25:54.895 --> 01:25:58.117]  The West helped build them up and let them reconstitute.
[01:25:58.357 --> 01:26:00.939]  So they are basically guilty of it.
[01:26:01.319 --> 01:26:09.845]  And I think that's why you see Cameron and others scrambling to distance themselves from this and act like they're all upset because they know that this is a major escalation
[01:26:10.445 --> 01:26:13.048]  And I think probably ISIS did this on their own.
[01:26:13.068 --> 01:26:17.192]  What do you think?
[01:26:17.212 --> 01:26:28.162]  You know, we can call it ISIS, but they have their networks, just like, you know, this whole alternative currency network called Hawala, where they can send money anywhere in the world by unorthodox means.
[01:26:28.755 --> 01:26:32.200]  They have their contacts, and for the right price, people will do it.
[01:26:34.543 --> 01:26:35.925]  I'm very glad that you said that.
[01:26:35.985 --> 01:26:39.570]  We have built this up, and look at the fallout from this.
[01:26:39.630 --> 01:26:44.757]  The thousands of people going to Europe, it's kind of inundating that civilization.
[01:26:45.837 --> 01:26:57.582]  Not that these are bad people, but this is not something that, you know, such a drastic change in such a short time by so many people is just deleterious to any... It's a destabilization program.
[01:26:57.602 --> 01:26:58.923]  What do you think the endgame is?
[01:27:02.124 --> 01:27:03.484]  Well, the endgame is chaos.
[01:27:03.785 --> 01:27:04.945]  That is for sure.
[01:27:05.045 --> 01:27:05.765]  The endgame is for sure.
[01:27:05.945 --> 01:27:07.126]  May I just add one more thing?
[01:27:07.326 --> 01:27:11.888]  You know, despite what Bolton and all these neocon enablers say,
[01:27:13.395 --> 01:27:14.095]  I don't think so.
[01:27:26.607 --> 01:27:39.100]  But they're very measured and they'll take this, but I think this is going to mean a loss of tourism wholesale for that region of the world and perhaps even other places.
[01:27:39.500 --> 01:27:43.704]  Sure, that's the sad part is it's only going to hurt the Muslims and the Arabs and the Africans.
[01:27:45.437 --> 01:27:48.299]  These radical jihadi groups are just a scourge in the Middle East.
[01:27:48.359 --> 01:27:55.004]  It's a beautiful place, it's been stable before, and it's just been wrecked by the West funding these groups.
[01:27:55.064 --> 01:27:56.965]  I mean, the West is guilty to a great extent of this.
[01:27:56.985 --> 01:27:57.565]  Thank you for the call.
[01:27:58.026 --> 01:27:59.727]  John in Texas, you're on the air.
[01:27:59.747 --> 01:28:00.327]  Thanks for holding.
[01:28:00.347 --> 01:28:02.949]  Hey Alex.
[01:28:03.729 --> 01:28:03.989]  Hi.
[01:28:04.890 --> 01:28:07.672]  You know, the country you need to go visit is Russia.
[01:28:08.274 --> 01:28:10.435]  We really need to know what's going on in Russia.
[01:28:10.515 --> 01:28:12.335]  Is Vladimir Putin really a reformer?
[01:28:12.695 --> 01:28:13.716]  Are the churches open?
[01:28:13.776 --> 01:28:15.096]  Are the people having more freedom?
[01:28:15.336 --> 01:28:17.117]  You know, I've thought about that.
[01:28:17.157 --> 01:28:20.558]  Next, I also want to go to Russia and investigate that for myself as well.
[01:28:20.638 --> 01:28:20.958]  I agree.
[01:28:23.138 --> 01:28:35.082]  And as far as that one guy said about the Middle East, that there's so many intelligence agencies over there, the New World, backing all these Arab groups that nobody knows for sure.
[01:28:35.714 --> 01:28:37.695]  You know, what's really going on there?
[01:28:37.815 --> 01:28:44.979]  I mean, was that just a fringe Muslim group that did it on their own, or were they under the direction of one of our intelligence agencies?
[01:28:46.519 --> 01:28:48.240]  There's a lot of ifs and buts.
[01:28:48.440 --> 01:28:49.161]  What's going on there?
[01:28:49.421 --> 01:28:50.802]  Sure, but the message is clear.
[01:28:51.202 --> 01:28:57.945]  Saudi Arabia said, we're going to start hitting you a year ago with terrorism, soft targets, if you don't back off in Syria, now it's happened.
[01:28:58.185 --> 01:29:00.206]  So I think they're guilty just for what they said.
[01:29:00.226 --> 01:29:05.229]  I mean, if you say, do this or I'm going to kill you, and then that person gets killed, who's the prime suspect?
[01:29:06.940 --> 01:29:07.841]  No, Saudis.
[01:29:08.561 --> 01:29:10.222]  Saudis are working for us, though.
[01:29:10.242 --> 01:29:10.862]  They're our boys.
[01:29:11.383 --> 01:29:12.363]  No, I totally agree.
[01:29:12.423 --> 01:29:15.465]  And when we say working for us, this isn't us doing this.
[01:29:15.485 --> 01:29:21.829]  This is crazy criminals that have hijacked this country and are trying to put tranny bathrooms in elementary schools.
[01:29:22.670 --> 01:29:24.251]  We are living in an insane asylum.
[01:29:26.226 --> 01:29:26.506]  We are.
[01:29:26.546 --> 01:29:29.308]  We got the clean people running the country.
[01:29:29.368 --> 01:29:32.530]  And they're not only running the country, they're running Europe and a lot of other places.
[01:29:32.650 --> 01:29:34.652]  Yeah, we're in decline like Camille Paglia said.
[01:29:34.672 --> 01:29:36.153]  And again, I'm not obsessing on trannies.
[01:29:36.533 --> 01:29:39.875]  She said the obsession on trannies is a sign of our total decline.
[01:29:40.615 --> 01:29:41.156]  Our elites
[01:29:41.636 --> 01:29:48.279]  I think they can go around messing with everybody all day, and jack with our families, and tell us what to eat, and tell us how to have babies.
[01:29:48.339 --> 01:29:49.539]  I mean, it's just, they're crazy!
[01:29:49.899 --> 01:29:51.000]  Get out of our lives!
[01:29:51.040 --> 01:29:52.100]  You're not God!
[01:29:52.460 --> 01:29:53.621]  Stop starting wars!
[01:29:53.901 --> 01:29:55.201]  Stop murdering Christians!
[01:29:55.901 --> 01:29:57.122]  We'll be back with Ron Paul.
[01:29:58.202 --> 01:29:59.103]  We're on the march.
[01:29:59.603 --> 01:30:01.204]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:30:02.124 --> 01:30:04.805]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:08.837 --> 01:30:09.577]  You've heard of the U.S.
[01:30:09.617 --> 01:30:16.720]  government wasting money on studies like mountain lions on treadmills, shrimp on treadmills, and even the effects of Swedish massage on rabbits.
[01:30:16.880 --> 01:30:19.982]  This latest example of waste comes out of the Illinois EPA.
[01:30:20.102 --> 01:30:25.124]  In fact, I tweeted, state government needs nine-step anal retentive plan to compost pumpkins?
[01:30:25.404 --> 01:30:26.584]  That's right, it's all in the article.
[01:30:26.724 --> 01:30:30.586]  Illinois EPA, pumpkins must be managed to protect human health by Kit Daniels.
[01:30:30.726 --> 01:30:36.770]  And in it, you can find a link to the actual nine-step process for local cities to collect pumpkins for composting.
[01:30:36.950 --> 01:30:37.730]  Here's step two.
[01:30:37.930 --> 01:30:44.674]  Pumpkins must not be accepted from other persons, including but not limited to owners and operators of rented or leased residences where pumpkins were used for decorative purposes.
[01:30:44.854 --> 01:30:48.497]  Commercial haulers and other commercial, industrial, agricultural, and government operations are entities.
[01:30:48.517 --> 01:30:49.617]  How are you going to figure that out?
[01:30:49.777 --> 01:30:50.298]  Step nine.
[01:30:50.458 --> 01:30:57.142]  The transfer and ultimate disposition of pumpkins received at the collection event must comply with the agency's approval, including all conditions contained in the approval.
[01:30:57.282 --> 01:30:59.163]  Do you have your TPS report cover sheet?
[01:30:59.403 --> 01:31:01.645]  Did you see the memo about this?
[01:31:01.925 --> 01:31:04.787]  If you don't, then you cannot compost pumpkins in Illinois!
[01:31:04.967 --> 01:31:05.427]  Okay.

[01:32:07.184 --> 01:32:11.726]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[01:32:12.026 --> 01:32:16.988]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors,
[01:32:17.008 --> 01:32:17.668]  We're good to go.
[01:32:38.382 --> 01:32:39.322]  BrainForce is here.
[01:32:39.503 --> 01:32:41.603]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[01:32:41.703 --> 01:32:46.446]  You've probably noticed I've been more focused, less brain fog, more energy, and it's because of BrainForce.
[01:32:46.706 --> 01:32:48.346]  There's always hidden additives in your food.
[01:32:48.406 --> 01:32:49.907]  Even organic food has hidden additives.
[01:32:49.987 --> 01:32:53.189]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[01:32:53.469 --> 01:32:55.269]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[01:32:55.450 --> 01:32:56.350]  It doesn't have stimulants.
[01:32:56.370 --> 01:32:57.330]  It doesn't have garbage in it.
[01:32:57.590 --> 01:32:59.471]  It has natural things that do it clean.

[01:33:15.314 --> 01:33:16.074]  Big Brother.
[01:33:17.435 --> 01:33:18.695]  Mainstream media.
[01:33:20.216 --> 01:33:21.336]  Government cover-ups.
[01:33:22.796 --> 01:33:23.757]  You want answers?
[01:33:24.737 --> 01:33:26.478]  Well, so does he.
[01:33:26.618 --> 01:33:32.940]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:37.134 --> 01:33:42.479]  We're live, ladies and gentlemen, on this Thursday worldwide broadcast, the 5th day of November 2015.
[01:33:42.620 --> 01:33:57.514]  Now we've had so many requests, people like to hear it live on the radio, and not everybody's on the internet, that I will re-air the Matt Drudge interview from a month ago when he just showed up in studio and revealed what he told us privately that he's a big superfan.
[01:33:58.335 --> 01:34:00.557]  Obviously he's linked to us today in some of our reports.
[01:34:01.638 --> 01:34:03.340]  So it's a great interview.
[01:34:03.840 --> 01:34:06.503]  It was in over 500 newspapers that we know of.
[01:34:06.523 --> 01:34:07.864]  It was all over national television.
[01:34:08.185 --> 01:34:10.927]  It was really an informative interview on so many subjects.
[01:34:11.308 --> 01:34:12.989]  He only gives an interview every few years.
[01:34:13.490 --> 01:34:15.352]  That interview will re-air in the third hour.
[01:34:15.392 --> 01:34:20.277]  Then David Knight comes in with the fourth hour to host with all the latest breaking news and other intel.
[01:34:21.772 --> 01:34:28.920]  Now I'm very honored to have Congressman, former Congressman and Medical Doctor Ron Paul join us today.
[01:34:29.580 --> 01:34:32.283]  Ron Paul joins us to talk about election 2016 and his
[01:34:34.577 --> 01:34:35.598]  We're good to go.
[01:34:56.530 --> 01:35:07.900]  The big tell is that they spend so much time attacking him and so much time trying to not give him enough time in the debates because they know that he actually has a real domestic and foreign policy.
[01:35:07.940 --> 01:35:12.425]  And usually when Ron Paul comes on, the elder, he doesn't talk a lot about his son.
[01:35:12.965 --> 01:35:15.868]  But today I'm told that he's happy to get into some of that.
[01:35:16.188 --> 01:35:19.751]  So what should we tackle first, Mr. Paul, Dr. Paul?
[01:35:19.771 --> 01:35:21.353]  There's so much to go over here.
[01:35:21.673 --> 01:35:22.354]  Where should we start?
[01:35:23.294 --> 01:35:25.935]  Well, I think you've touched on the most important thing.
[01:35:26.196 --> 01:35:29.297]  You know, I think they fear the truth.
[01:35:29.577 --> 01:35:30.938]  You're a victim of that too.
[01:35:30.998 --> 01:35:34.640]  They don't put you on national news all the time when you try to get the truth out.
[01:35:35.120 --> 01:35:38.082]  And when Rand does, you know, he's excluded.
[01:35:38.202 --> 01:35:47.047]  And you remember so clearly when you were giving us support, you know, four and eight years ago, that they don't want to hear the truth because we're challenging them.
[01:35:47.561 --> 01:35:49.704]  And it isn't like it's the Democrats' fault.
[01:35:50.064 --> 01:35:56.672]  It's just as much the Republicans' because, you know, there is this tremendous coalition between the leadership of both parties.
[01:35:56.712 --> 01:36:00.937]  You take, for instance, I think it dramatically illustrates
[01:36:02.045 --> 01:36:11.591]  How the two parties work when you see Pelosi and Boehner working so hard to raise the debt and the spending and claim, you know, the world would come to an end if we didn't do this.
[01:36:12.011 --> 01:36:22.058]  So therefore, even if you're an independent Democrat or an independent Republican or an independent thinking person in the presidential race,
[01:36:22.658 --> 01:36:36.652]  Yes, they have to do a lot to destroy that individual, but hopefully we can overcome that because, you know, the truth is hard to destroy, although they have a lot of tools that they can work us over on.
[01:36:38.629 --> 01:36:50.632]  Now I'm told today at RandPaul.com, folks can go there and find out about a new initiative to really try to get Rand Paul back up at the front of the line.
[01:36:51.372 --> 01:36:55.814]  Even though you didn't win your three runs for the presidency, you know the one back in the
[01:36:57.354 --> 01:36:59.555]  80s and then of course the two more recently.
[01:36:59.855 --> 01:37:12.119]  It built a liberty movement now that has built the true libertarian Tea Party that's now challenging the neocons that you were just talking about and unseating people like Boehner and almost getting an audit of the Fed.
[01:37:12.159 --> 01:37:17.080]  We've gone from you getting no co-sponsors 20 years ago to almost auditing the Fed.
[01:37:17.120 --> 01:37:21.842]  So clearly ICS is gaining ground and even if Rand Paul doesn't win
[01:37:22.762 --> 01:37:28.164]  Supporting him, donating, spreading the word wins because he gets the word out.
[01:37:28.244 --> 01:37:30.445]  But he actually has a shot.
[01:37:30.525 --> 01:37:32.206]  He's been the frontrunner before.
[01:37:32.546 --> 01:37:34.347]  We see people shoot back and forth.
[01:37:35.167 --> 01:37:36.828]  I've seen the national polls, as you know.
[01:37:36.888 --> 01:37:37.708]  You've also got them.
[01:37:38.168 --> 01:37:42.290]  He's one of the best candidates, if not the best, in an election with Hillary.
[01:37:42.590 --> 01:37:43.771]  That's my big concern.
[01:37:44.051 --> 01:37:51.514]  Some of these other candidates show well with Republican voters because of their rhetoric, but they just don't have the background to prove that they do what they say they'll do.
[01:37:52.369 --> 01:37:59.514]  Yeah, they're too similar, you know, because they endorse the same foreign policy, and Rand is the only one that has a different foreign policy.
[01:37:59.935 --> 01:38:07.881]  But, you know, it's a real dilemma about the Tea Party movement, because it's not a monolith.
[01:38:07.941 --> 01:38:12.725]  And you recall very well when it started, and, you know, it started with our first campaign.
[01:38:12.805 --> 01:38:14.066]  You started it?
[01:38:14.326 --> 01:38:19.890]  On the original date of the Tea Party, you know, in 07, I guess it was.
[01:38:21.471 --> 01:38:35.483]  But, you know, when it became so popular and we tapped into how unhappy the people were, very quickly the moneyed interests, you know, the pro-war people and the pro-big government people, they quickly usurped this.
[01:38:35.523 --> 01:38:40.747]  They got in and got control of it and they blended it into, you know, the conventional Republican message.
[01:38:41.107 --> 01:38:48.610]  So, there was a time early on when it was very, very delineating with, if you were a member of the Tea Party.
[01:38:48.870 --> 01:38:55.732]  But right now, you know, if you bump into somebody and say, well, I'm a member of the Tea Party, well, I'd like to know what they believe in.
[01:38:55.792 --> 01:39:04.135]  And so often, they don't have the vaguest idea of how it was started and what the original intent was, and the Tea Party has lost its momentum.
[01:39:04.639 --> 01:39:07.161]  But I don't think the ideas have lost the momentum.
[01:39:07.181 --> 01:39:10.983]  The American people, as a matter of fact, in some ways, I see that we have gained a lot.
[01:39:11.043 --> 01:39:16.506]  I think the large majority of American people aren't looking for another war, and they don't trust Obama on foreign policy.
[01:39:17.067 --> 01:39:22.850]  I think now, and you already mentioned the Fed, more people are concerned about the Fed today than they've ever been.
[01:39:22.870 --> 01:39:29.894]  I just wish we could get this out, and that's what I want Rand to be able to do to counteract
[01:39:31.195 --> 01:39:40.803]  You know, the media trying to exclude him is to get the issue of the monetary policy and the Federal Reserve out there as well as the foreign policy.
[01:39:41.184 --> 01:39:48.150]  But even from the very first time he started campaigning for the Senate, his big issue has always been the debt.
[01:39:48.510 --> 01:39:52.352]  And it's a good item, because debt represents big government.
[01:39:52.673 --> 01:39:58.476]  If you can't have the debt, if you can't monetize the debt, and you run out of borrowing, you know, the government has to collapse.
[01:39:58.917 --> 01:40:08.042]  So far, the Fed still has the credibility, they can monetize debt, and people are still behind the spending, and the Paul Krugman's of the world are still winning the day.
[01:40:08.302 --> 01:40:09.503]  Deficits don't matter.
[01:40:09.843 --> 01:40:16.948]  But I'll tell you what, I think the majority of American people are waking up, and it's been shows like yours and many others on the Internet,
[01:40:17.506 --> 01:40:17.626]  Sure.
[01:40:17.646 --> 01:40:18.146]  Well, I should...
[01:40:39.133 --> 01:40:45.696]  Delineate that more myself, because I was there when it spontaneously, when you launched on that date, began what we call the Tea Party.
[01:40:45.736 --> 01:40:47.657]  They were mad at the Republicans and Democrats.
[01:40:48.118 --> 01:40:51.079]  They were libertarian, constitutionalist, paleo-conservatives.
[01:40:51.680 --> 01:40:54.261]  And the media admitted it was Ron Paul's Tea Party.
[01:40:54.281 --> 01:40:56.362]  These crowds of 5,000, 10,000, 40,000, 50,000 or bigger
[01:41:00.584 --> 01:41:02.065]  And then they send in the Republicans.
[01:41:02.465 --> 01:41:03.526]  They tried to take it over.
[01:41:03.946 --> 01:41:07.908]  I think they've lost really completely co-opting it, though they partially did.
[01:41:07.928 --> 01:41:11.330]  I think there's a battle over the soul of it, but I agree with you.
[01:41:11.370 --> 01:41:17.273]  We don't stand or fall in the Tea Party, but you see how the Republican and Democratic leadership, when we get internal
[01:41:18.093 --> 01:41:20.695]  audio of their high-level fundraiser meetings.
[01:41:21.075 --> 01:41:29.961]  They've circled the wagons to give money collectively to defeat Campaign for Liberty people, to stop folks that are affiliated with you or sound like you.
[01:41:30.402 --> 01:41:38.667]  And so I think it's important, even though you're a humble man, Dr. Paul, to talk about the fact that you really are the founder of what is the Tea Party.
[01:41:39.068 --> 01:41:42.370]  And so I think people should listen to that and know where they came from.
[01:41:42.410 --> 01:41:44.872]  It's not John Boehner, it's not
[01:41:45.745 --> 01:41:48.927]  Paul Ryan, it's not people like Newt Gingrich.
[01:41:49.007 --> 01:42:00.436]  No, they are the neocon rhinos that are the problem, and they have attacked your son so much because they know his track record working with you, working with others, where he stood.
[01:42:00.456 --> 01:42:01.636]  I mean, I remember Rand.
[01:42:02.677 --> 01:42:18.127]  Whenever I was trying to get you on my show, when you were running for Congress in, like, 1996, trying to get back in, and you'd come on, you'd gotten some support, and then I got a call from the campaign saying, well, Rand's starting to do interviews, that's his son, can he come on so we can get some more critical votes?
[01:42:18.167 --> 01:42:22.070]  Because back then your district still came into the south of Austin, and I was on the radio in Austin.
[01:42:22.370 --> 01:42:31.957]  So, I mean, that's how long he's been fighting for the Liberty Movement, and that's why I know we can trust him, and that's why there's a money bomb today at RandPaul.com.
[01:42:32.997 --> 01:42:48.926]  And folks, especially if you're middle class or wealthy, if you're not giving money to Libertarian Patriot candidates, and if you're not supporting really the guy that's carrying the torch for the Campaign of Liberty type movement, that's been persecuted, dirty tricks, you name it, you're crazy.
[01:42:49.346 --> 01:42:54.509]  You can't ask people to run for Congress or run for Senate or run for President and then not support them.
[01:42:55.089 --> 01:42:58.132]  And, you know, usually it's poor people end up giving money to folks.
[01:42:58.232 --> 01:43:00.314]  It needs to be the middle class.
[01:43:00.414 --> 01:43:07.481]  If you don't vote with your dollars, and if you don't vote with your mouth, and vote with writing letters to the editor, if you don't get aggressive...
[01:43:08.308 --> 01:43:09.328]  We're going to lose this country.
[01:43:09.729 --> 01:43:23.415]  So I want to see a lot of people go to RandPaul.com today and to donate so that we can continue to have him out there in the debates, on the campaign trail, and there's a good chance he can vault back to number one and could beat Hillary in a general election.
[01:43:25.636 --> 01:43:26.777]  Sorry, Ron Paul, go ahead.
[01:43:27.057 --> 01:43:35.240]  I was going to say, you stated it well, because I've never been real good at calling up a person and saying, hey, how about donating money?
[01:43:35.501 --> 01:43:36.341]  Somebody told me once,
[01:43:36.829 --> 01:43:43.114]  Don't approach this thing that they're donating money, because in reality we should be asking people to invest their money.
[01:43:43.174 --> 01:43:46.236]  It's not like they're donating money to Ron Paul or Rand Paul.
[01:43:46.657 --> 01:43:48.518]  I mean, this is expensive.
[01:43:48.578 --> 01:43:56.705]  And to compete with either the very wealthy candidates or to compete with, you know, the establishment parties and you know... This is a war.
[01:43:56.785 --> 01:43:57.185]  Yeah.
[01:43:57.385 --> 01:43:57.986]  It's a war.
[01:43:58.086 --> 01:44:00.888]  Our founders gave all their treasure, their blood, their families.
[01:44:01.268 --> 01:44:04.911]  We're not going to save the republic without giving blood, sweat, tears and money.
[01:44:04.951 --> 01:44:05.712]  That's what I'm getting at.
[01:44:07.858 --> 01:44:21.007]  And that of course is, you know, I think the telltale of this campaign is going to be decided here within the next month or so, and we're hoping that this money bomb is going to be, you know, very instrumental.
[01:44:21.308 --> 01:44:24.490]  But, you know, even with the less funds that he's had,
[01:44:25.609 --> 01:44:31.891]  The organization is still working very hard on the same tactics that I use, and that is get to the college campuses.
[01:44:31.991 --> 01:44:37.352]  And you know, there's a bunch of young people who are out there, and it's sort of under the radar.
[01:44:37.592 --> 01:44:45.174]  You don't hear, you know, they wouldn't give us credit and say, you know, he has 10,000 young people organized to go out and round up the votes.
[01:44:45.254 --> 01:44:46.514]  No, they don't want to do that.
[01:44:46.934 --> 01:44:54.476]  But, and like he says, you know, these people who come around and say, all right, you're not rating high enough, why don't you just quit?
[01:44:54.816 --> 01:44:58.560]  He says, well, they at least ought to have the chance to vote.
[01:44:58.920 --> 01:45:05.787]  Maybe the people orchestrating this, well, you better just drop out, are the ones who are fearful that he might stay in.
[01:45:06.988 --> 01:45:13.835]  But we still have to prove that we have the funds to get out to vote and score in the early primaries.
[01:45:15.316 --> 01:45:19.858]  Undoubtedly, there's been a lot of dirty tricks in the media, attempts to shoot him down.
[01:45:19.878 --> 01:45:26.822]  I know you don't like to give a lot of attention to that, but that's the proof that somebody's the person to support when the establishment's coming after him.
[01:45:27.462 --> 01:45:31.705]  I've never heard Rand Paul say that he loves Hillary Clinton.
[01:45:32.225 --> 01:45:34.486]  I've never heard him say he's for an assault weapons ban.
[01:45:34.886 --> 01:45:36.367]  I have heard that out of Donald Trump.
[01:45:36.767 --> 01:45:39.409]  People are in love with Donald Trump's rhetoric.
[01:45:39.989 --> 01:45:43.651]  I'm just concerned that there may be a double-cross going on here.
[01:45:45.120 --> 01:45:53.445]  Yeah, and unfortunately, you know, the popularity there might get things moved along, and then when you discover the double-cross.
[01:45:53.805 --> 01:45:56.226]  But you know, that's sort of typical of most politicians.
[01:45:56.266 --> 01:45:59.748]  They say one thing, and they fool and deceive the people, then they get in.
[01:46:00.989 --> 01:46:05.932]  Just think of Obama running as the peace candidate, you know, and heck,
[01:46:06.357 --> 01:46:09.980]  He's going to have more wars going on than he inherited, and they were bad enough already.
[01:46:10.600 --> 01:46:17.886]  But they're able to deceive the people, and that's the reason why we have to be able to get a message out.
[01:46:18.466 --> 01:46:19.327]  Well, I totally agree with you.
[01:46:19.347 --> 01:46:25.291]  In the few minutes we have left, speaking of war, Rand Paul was the first to expose that we were becoming al-Qaeda's air force in Syria.
[01:46:25.591 --> 01:46:28.293]  To say no to it, then Ted Cruz jumped on the bandwagon to his credit.
[01:46:29.354 --> 01:46:34.258]  And then expanding on all of that, then the media turns around and goes, Rand Paul's not tough on ISIS.
[01:46:34.918 --> 01:46:40.539]  When Rand Paul, Senator Paul, from the beginning tried to stop the whole war from happening.
[01:46:40.559 --> 01:46:48.241]  It's just the incredible ignorance of some of the voting public sometimes about geopolitical issues.
[01:46:48.701 --> 01:46:51.082]  And then separately, the Russian airliner getting blown up.
[01:46:51.542 --> 01:46:54.443]  I'm concerned Russia's being sucked into a new Afghanistan.
[01:46:56.083 --> 01:46:59.304]  Yeah, that very well could be the case.
[01:47:01.088 --> 01:47:07.375]  I'm afraid of the escalation, whether it's our involvement there or even the Russians' involvement.
[01:47:07.755 --> 01:47:15.923]  I know they have an easier justification, the fact that they have a base and a treaty and they've been invited in there by the government is one thing.
[01:47:15.983 --> 01:47:22.329]  But still, there's too much room for error what's going on over there because nobody knows.
[01:47:23.290 --> 01:47:24.171]  You know, what's going on?
[01:47:24.211 --> 01:47:29.774]  I was speaking the other day about the old song about who's on first, you know, Abbott and Costello.
[01:47:30.315 --> 01:47:30.915]  Who's on first?
[01:47:31.736 --> 01:47:32.556]  Who's in charge?
[01:47:32.856 --> 01:47:33.757]  Who's the enemy?
[01:47:35.298 --> 01:47:45.224]  Because it's absolute chaos, you know, and again, Obama just announced they were going to drop more weapons in for the ISIS faction or the Al-Qaeda faction or whatever that they like.
[01:47:45.604 --> 01:47:51.068]  And they don't know any more than the man in the moon because it ends up usually being used against us.
[01:47:51.860 --> 01:47:57.642]  What do you make of Putin coming out and saying man-made global warming is nothing but a global government tax to wreck nation-states?
[01:47:57.982 --> 01:48:06.045]  Now the Hungarian Prime Minister's come out and said the treasonous conspiracy to marginalize nation-states, opening their borders, more and more.
[01:48:06.065 --> 01:48:08.665]  I mean, I read the Russian news every day.
[01:48:08.685 --> 01:48:11.006]  It sounds like it's libertarian or something.
[01:48:11.326 --> 01:48:16.048]  That's really scary when the foreign press sounds more Americana than America.
[01:48:17.355 --> 01:48:46.191]  Yeah, that is a little bit scary, and then you always get blamed, and of course you get blamed for a lot of things, as I do, but then you do this, and then they accuse you of, you hate America, you're un-American, you know all that nonsense, you're against the troops, and yet, so often you come up with some points that Putin makes, but it never distracts from my position that the founders were correct in staying out of these
[01:48:46.787 --> 01:48:48.209]  Entangling alliances.
[01:48:48.229 --> 01:48:58.419]  You know, if Russia and Putin is not moving in the direction that we think and hope, then they have to deal with that.
[01:48:58.439 --> 01:49:01.502]  They're going to mess with... It will be nothing automatic.
[01:49:01.522 --> 01:49:03.184]  They're going to mess with Afghanistan.
[01:49:03.284 --> 01:49:05.406]  We never even learned any lesson about that.
[01:49:06.016 --> 01:49:08.737]  But I think it's their area of the world.
[01:49:08.757 --> 01:49:17.561]  Can you imagine what we'd be like if the Chinese and the Russians were on the borders of Mexico?
[01:49:19.022 --> 01:49:21.062]  We would be pretty much outraged.
[01:49:21.403 --> 01:49:26.105]  But I think NATO is one of the most ornery organizations.
[01:49:27.845 --> 01:49:32.288]  Putin is more or less counteracting the aggressiveness of NATO.
[01:49:32.348 --> 01:49:38.392]  NATO's the one that's putting these missiles right up on their borders and getting in stir and trouble up in Ukraine.
[01:49:38.412 --> 01:49:50.219]  So, you know, I always remember back when Robert Taft advised we not even get into NATO, that it would involve us in Baghdistan and in Europe.
[01:49:50.299 --> 01:49:52.240]  And I think that's exactly what has happened.
[01:49:52.813 --> 01:49:59.577]  Well, RandPaul.com, a money bomb going on right now, and it is so important to have Rand Paul in this race.
[01:50:00.358 --> 01:50:03.780]  We've got to keep him in there for the long haul, so it's important to donate, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:50:04.080 --> 01:50:05.241]  It is an investment.
[01:50:05.661 --> 01:50:06.882]  It is war bonds.
[01:50:07.382 --> 01:50:09.464]  And if we don't resist, we know we're going to lose.
[01:50:09.944 --> 01:50:10.905]  If we don't give up,
[01:50:11.685 --> 01:50:15.187]  Uh, then we know in the end we're going to win because what we're promoting is freedom.
[01:50:15.207 --> 01:50:17.268]  What we're promoting is the answer to all this tyranny.
[01:50:17.609 --> 01:50:19.790]  We're coming close to the financial implosion.
[01:50:19.810 --> 01:50:22.011]  Uh, more and more people are waking up.
[01:50:22.051 --> 01:50:23.892]  I mean, in closing, we got 30 seconds.
[01:50:23.912 --> 01:50:26.013]  Look at the Pope calling for world government, Mr. Paul.
[01:50:26.474 --> 01:50:30.456]  I mean, it is just a wild time where everything we've talked about is pretty much coming true.
[01:50:31.451 --> 01:50:42.898]  Yeah, and I think that every single day that you can see this, and yet the deception continues, you know, but it is going to be the confidence factor, which is a subjective factor.
[01:50:42.998 --> 01:50:48.762]  When the confidence is lost in us, in trust in America, trust in our military, or trust in our dollar,
[01:50:49.474 --> 01:50:52.376]  This thing comes unraveled rather quickly.
[01:50:52.916 --> 01:50:55.318]  It won't be stoppable.
[01:50:56.579 --> 01:51:00.021]  It's a house of cards, and I think you're absolutely right.
[01:51:00.061 --> 01:51:01.482]  We're approaching that rather rapidly.
[01:51:01.562 --> 01:51:03.703]  Dr. Paul, Godspeed, RamPaul.com.
[01:51:03.743 --> 01:51:05.104]  Get in there and buy your war bonds.
[01:51:05.144 --> 01:51:05.925]  Thank you so much, sir.
[01:51:06.738 --> 01:51:07.018]  Thank you.
[01:51:07.659 --> 01:51:07.960]  We'll be back.
[01:51:23.999 --> 01:51:26.723]  This hour of GCN brought to you by Lissig.

[01:52:10.336 --> 01:52:11.617]  You can't survive without it.
[01:52:11.817 --> 01:52:12.697]  But where do you get it?
[01:52:13.017 --> 01:52:18.781]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new, groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.

[01:52:44.663 --> 01:52:45.843]  Stainless steel construction.

[01:52:47.163 --> 01:52:47.803]  Low maintenance.
[01:52:48.083 --> 01:52:49.903]  Replacement filters are simple to install.

[01:53:08.507 --> 01:53:11.510]  My name is Bill Bonner, and I have an important message.
[01:53:11.830 --> 01:53:16.994]  Right now, the highest levels of government are struggling against an inevitable crisis.
[01:53:17.315 --> 01:53:19.216]  But they're about to lose control.
[01:53:19.597 --> 01:53:24.581]  When this happens, it will rip our country apart in ways you never imagined.
[01:53:24.921 --> 01:53:29.385]  From where we shop, to the doctors you visit, and the family you want to protect.
[01:53:29.485 --> 01:53:31.527]  Look, I've made predictions like this before.
[01:53:31.887 --> 01:53:35.390]  A few years ago, I warned that the housing prices would collapse.
[01:53:35.731 --> 01:53:39.815]  Before that, I warned that dot-com companies would crash, and they did.
[01:53:40.255 --> 01:53:45.780]  Those who listened had a chance to save themselves, but this has nothing to do with the stock market.
[01:53:45.960 --> 01:53:47.361]  This will affect us all.
[01:53:47.822 --> 01:53:51.325]  I've posted a free video at DollarDanger.com.
[01:53:52.546 --> 01:53:58.788]  Maybe you'll disagree with my conclusions, but first you need to watch this video and see the facts for yourself.
[01:53:58.928 --> 01:54:04.829]  You can watch the video for free right now by going to DollarDanger.com.
[01:54:05.029 --> 01:54:07.050]  Again, that's DollarDanger.com.
[01:54:16.690 --> 01:54:23.997]  All right, I'm going to do this segment the next.
[01:54:24.017 --> 01:54:26.420]  We're going to go to the interview with Drudge.
[01:54:26.480 --> 01:54:27.561]  There's been so many requests for that.
[01:54:27.581 --> 01:54:30.344]  And then David Knight comes back live in the fourth hour.
[01:54:30.364 --> 01:54:33.627]  That interview that good, you got to air it at least once.
[01:54:34.328 --> 01:54:36.330]  And I don't mean it's some rebroadcast on a holiday.
[01:54:37.901 --> 01:54:41.763]  I want to go to Doug, Charlene, Dave, Tom, Mama, and others.
[01:54:41.783 --> 01:54:43.625]  We're going to go to Tom in London here in just a moment.
[01:54:44.345 --> 01:54:46.747]  First off, we're trying to support Rand Paul.
[01:54:46.767 --> 01:54:48.248]  We're trying to support authors.
[01:54:48.868 --> 01:54:50.169]  We're trying to have other people on.
[01:54:50.189 --> 01:54:52.030]  I mean, we're just here trying to promote the Liberty Movement.
[01:54:52.870 --> 01:54:55.052]  But you funding this show is so key.
[01:54:55.072 --> 01:55:04.418]  When you buy a Hillary for Prison shirt, or you buy a Mass Murderers Agree Gun Control Works, or you buy an anti-socialism shirt, or a Molon Labe pro-gun shirt,
[01:55:05.515 --> 01:55:10.737]  When you buy a Alexa Pure Pro water filtration system, 10% off promo code water.
[01:55:11.658 --> 01:55:20.961]  When you buy a LifeStraw or a LifeSpring Straw or other survival items or high quality storable foods at InfoWarsStore.com, you are funding this operation.
[01:55:22.462 --> 01:55:26.003]  Now this week's special, running Wednesday to next Wednesday, is BrainForce.
[01:55:26.123 --> 01:55:28.624]  And I'm not going to sit here and belabor what's in BrainForce.
[01:55:28.644 --> 01:55:30.705]  Go to InfoWarsLife.com and read it for yourself.
[01:55:31.166 --> 01:55:31.866]  This is
[01:55:33.263 --> 01:55:43.886]  The best brain pill without being speedy and without feeling bad later that we come up with with the very best organic ingredients and it's got a whole bunch of them in there.
[01:55:44.226 --> 01:55:45.146]  Go read about it today.
[01:55:45.206 --> 01:55:49.668]  It's 25% off brain force and we sell out of this every time we get it back in.
[01:55:49.688 --> 01:55:51.268]  So we do a discount on something like this.
[01:55:52.028 --> 01:55:54.209]  It will really move quick and that also again.
[01:55:55.129 --> 01:56:06.834]  We'll help more folks take the leap, take the step to buy a bottle and try it out and then we think it's so good you'll start buying it and then that means we don't have to plug as much, which we only plug about once an hour.
[01:56:07.414 --> 01:56:09.055]  So that's how we fund this operation.
[01:56:09.155 --> 01:56:11.176]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:56:11.236 --> 01:56:14.657]  Infowarsstore.com is the big umbrella site.
[01:56:14.957 --> 01:56:22.840]  You can pay $5.95 a month and 20 people can use your membership to see the nightly news and all my films and e-books and other documentaries at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:56:25.649 --> 01:56:28.070]  I want to thank you all that are PrisonPlanet.TV members.
[01:56:28.150 --> 01:56:35.633]  It makes a great holiday gift to just buy one membership for yourself and then give your username so folks can log in and use it as Christmas presents as e-cards.
[01:56:36.474 --> 01:56:38.575]  That's a pretty good deal right there.
[01:56:38.655 --> 01:56:40.015]  PrisonPlanet.TV.
[01:56:40.576 --> 01:56:42.076]  Alright, Tom in London.
[01:56:42.156 --> 01:56:43.237]  It's Texas calling.
[01:56:43.717 --> 01:56:45.438]  Tom, you're on the air worldwide.
[01:56:45.478 --> 01:56:46.518]  What's your take on this plane?
[01:56:47.339 --> 01:56:47.979]  The Russian airliner.
[01:56:49.980 --> 01:56:51.040]  Okay, thanks Alex.
[01:56:52.881 --> 01:56:55.062]  I think if it was brought down by a bomb,
[01:56:56.945 --> 01:57:05.268]  We should consider that it was a false flag intended to blame ISIS, but committed by Putin.
[01:57:06.288 --> 01:57:08.989]  I think you have to look at the Russians staging false flags.
[01:57:09.009 --> 01:57:09.630]  They've done it before.
[01:57:09.650 --> 01:57:13.191]  Absolutely, yeah, they've done it before.
[01:57:13.211 --> 01:57:15.852]  In 1999, the apartment building in Moscow.
[01:57:15.952 --> 01:57:17.132]  They did catch Moscow.
[01:57:17.152 --> 01:57:21.153]  Sorry, go ahead and tell folks what they did.
[01:57:21.173 --> 01:57:24.074]  Yeah, that was the main justification for them going into Chechnya.
[01:57:26.659 --> 01:57:34.823]  And, you know, that was the only way they could have justified going in there and all the tens of thousands that the Russians lost.
[01:57:35.243 --> 01:57:41.066]  And I think that Putin knew from day one that he'd probably have to go in to Syria on the ground.
[01:57:42.767 --> 01:57:48.190]  And, you know, the Syrian army and Hezbollah are suffering quite heavy losses at the moment.
[01:57:49.040 --> 01:57:53.082]  And, you know, I heard that the Iranians had lost some of the senior officers there.
[01:57:53.562 --> 01:57:54.323]  Five of them.
[01:57:54.723 --> 01:57:57.444]  And I think there's only so much they can do from the air.
[01:57:57.504 --> 01:57:59.025]  They can hold the line, sort of thing.
[01:57:59.525 --> 01:58:04.008]  And they might risk losing the east to the Kurds, depending on what goes on there.
[01:58:04.988 --> 01:58:07.489]  So they might need to go in quite heavily on the ground.
[01:58:07.509 --> 01:58:14.373]  So it's possible that the only way that they could do that is to have this sort of outrage.
[01:58:16.294 --> 01:58:17.795]  You know, I said that earlier.
[01:58:17.855 --> 01:58:19.516]  I said, could it be a false flag?
[01:58:19.956 --> 01:58:22.697]  But then ISIS doesn't even do stuff that's good for them.
[01:58:22.737 --> 01:58:24.839]  It's bad for ISIS to blow up the plane if they did it.
[01:58:25.499 --> 01:58:28.260]  They have taken credit, but that could be a Russian cutout.
[01:58:29.081 --> 01:58:29.921]  You've got a good point.
[01:58:30.021 --> 01:58:32.623]  I don't think we know, because all these governments do false flags.
[01:58:33.343 --> 01:58:34.684]  Then there's the Machiavellian argument.
[01:58:34.704 --> 01:58:35.124]  Well, good.
[01:58:35.184 --> 01:58:39.326]  Russia kills 224 of its own people, so thousands don't die from an ISIS invasion.
[01:58:39.807 --> 01:58:41.187]  And that way leads to hell.
[01:58:41.267 --> 01:58:42.228]  That way is Mordor.
[01:58:42.748 --> 01:58:46.173]  That way is absolutely, and justifies the means, garbage.
[01:58:46.453 --> 01:58:47.014]  Thank you, Tom.
[01:58:47.094 --> 01:58:47.735]  Interesting point.

[01:59:52.095 --> 01:59:54.317]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:00:14.898 --> 02:00:15.518]  Big Brother.
[02:00:16.199 --> 02:00:17.219]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:17.959 --> 02:00:19.060]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:19.740 --> 02:00:20.521]  You want answers?
[02:00:21.301 --> 02:00:22.201]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:22.842 --> 02:00:26.463]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:27.044 --> 02:00:31.146]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:37.048 --> 02:00:38.009]  Doug in Minnesota.
[02:00:38.029 --> 02:00:39.089]  Thanks for holding her on the air.
[02:00:39.129 --> 02:00:39.470]  Welcome.
[02:00:41.190 --> 02:00:41.731]  How you doing?
[02:00:42.011 --> 02:00:42.391]  Good, brother.
[02:00:43.772 --> 02:00:57.526]  Hey, I was looking up this, uh, as far as, uh, the Militia Act of 1903, which basically prohibits anyone from removing the Second Amendment or changing it in any way.
[02:00:57.546 --> 02:01:01.170]  Uh, do you know anything about that?
[02:01:02.410 --> 02:01:14.035]  I am familiar with it, haven't read it in probably a decade, but the Second Amendment creates a militia and says everybody should be armed, and that's just like Switzerland, and clearly it's about individual ownership of firearms.
[02:01:15.496 --> 02:01:15.696]  Yep.
[02:01:16.456 --> 02:01:19.978]  I was just wondering if that was enough firepower to keep anybody from...
[02:01:20.720 --> 02:01:24.681]  Well, I mean, there's laws against forcibly inoculating people.
[02:01:24.941 --> 02:01:28.402]  There's laws against all sorts of things they just ignore.
[02:01:29.122 --> 02:01:32.102]  Or they write a new law that doesn't supersede the Bill of Rights.
[02:01:33.062 --> 02:01:34.263]  But, yeah, look.
[02:01:35.443 --> 02:01:36.743]  Laws only go so far.
[02:01:37.203 --> 02:01:38.624]  You have to enforce them.
[02:01:39.864 --> 02:01:45.385]  And the laws we have are being trampled with all these new regulations and things that aren't laws at all, Doug.
[02:01:46.783 --> 02:01:48.304]  Well, that's it.
[02:01:48.925 --> 02:01:56.871]  I'm kind of surprised that all the constitutional lawyers, the top ones, don't get together and just start hitting at the bottom.
[02:01:56.911 --> 02:01:59.613]  I mean, people are talking about, well, take Obama to court.
[02:01:59.673 --> 02:02:05.477]  No, start lower for the people you can prosecute, and they'll sing like birds.
[02:02:05.777 --> 02:02:07.739]  Absolutely, and then it's a chain reaction.
[02:02:07.759 --> 02:02:08.359]  Great point.
[02:02:09.000 --> 02:02:11.061]  Folks shouldn't shoot for such high targets sometimes.
[02:02:11.142 --> 02:02:12.563]  Go for the low-hanging fruit.
[02:02:13.103 --> 02:02:15.405]  Charlene in Pennsylvania, thanks for holding her on the air.
[02:02:16.860 --> 02:02:17.460]  Hi, Alex.
[02:02:18.321 --> 02:02:22.104]  I think if I was Putin, I would go after Malik Obama.
[02:02:23.204 --> 02:02:28.128]  That would cut off the money line to ISIS, because where is our tax dollars going?
[02:02:28.908 --> 02:02:35.233]  We know that that's a front for ISIS, who's funding the terrorists, our taxpayer dollars.
[02:02:35.873 --> 02:02:37.994]  If I was Putin, I would go after Malik.
[02:02:38.555 --> 02:02:39.796]  It would stop the chain of money.
[02:02:41.531 --> 02:02:50.857]  Well yeah, if Russia starts suing Obama's family members that are tied to the Muslim Brotherhood that could be tied to this bombing if it's not a false flag, then that could start a chain reaction.
[02:02:51.277 --> 02:02:56.040]  Just the PR alone of Russia suing Obama is priceless.
[02:02:58.024 --> 02:03:03.726]  Russia could have done this to legitimize being in Syria, but they've been playing it pretty clean.
[02:03:03.746 --> 02:03:05.307]  I just don't know.
[02:03:05.327 --> 02:03:07.408]  I mean, I'm not going to get up here and say we definitively know.
[02:03:07.768 --> 02:03:09.528]  I think more will come out, Charlene.
[02:03:09.568 --> 02:03:10.089]  Great points.
[02:03:10.109 --> 02:03:10.749]  Thanks for the call.
[02:03:11.129 --> 02:03:12.890]  Dave in Pennsylvania, you're on the air.
[02:03:12.930 --> 02:03:13.250]  Welcome.
[02:03:14.266 --> 02:03:21.317]  Yes, thank you Alex for having such fine guests like Dr. Group, Dr. Wallach, Pharmacist Ben Fuchs, Dr. Baylock.
[02:03:21.618 --> 02:03:23.801]  You've had some fantastic doctors on your show.
[02:03:23.841 --> 02:03:27.427]  I use Heart and Body Extract and Beyond Tangy Tangerine every day.
[02:03:27.447 --> 02:03:28.408]  Well, thank you, sir.
[02:03:29.594 --> 02:03:42.301]  And the reason why I'm calling, I've noticed that in this politically correct environment that we're now being forced to live under, that no one has made a big fuss over the holidays or after Thanksgiving, the big shopping day, Black Friday.
[02:03:42.601 --> 02:03:48.905]  Yeah, they haven't done that because everybody knows black means you're making money and red means you're not making money.
[02:03:49.645 --> 02:03:58.412]  But no, I would expect they'll, in fact, we should send somebody out and have them, we should send Leanne or somebody out and say, here we have a petition to ban the term Black Friday because it's hurtful.
[02:03:58.692 --> 02:04:02.215]  If you do it at a major university, nine out of ten folks will say ban it.
[02:04:02.295 --> 02:04:02.795]  I guarantee it.
[02:04:03.716 --> 02:04:14.444]  All it is is nothing more than another contrived attack on our First Amendment to, you know, twist everything around upside down, backwards, you know, and turn us into to be the most illiterate nation on the face of the earth.
[02:04:14.994 --> 02:04:16.396]  Well, that's how you screw people up.
[02:04:16.456 --> 02:04:22.005]  I mean, now the EPA came out and said restrict pumpkins because they're hurting the earth because of carbon dioxide.
[02:04:22.025 --> 02:04:23.026]  I mean, this is just baloney.
[02:04:24.840 --> 02:04:31.282]  If anyone does any research, check out sunspot activity.
[02:04:31.542 --> 02:04:33.042]  That is the main key driver.
[02:04:33.062 --> 02:04:35.283]  That's right, and it's low, so we're getting cold.
[02:04:35.823 --> 02:04:41.085]  Get more sunspots, that means mass coronal ejections, huge fireballs shooting out towards us, things get hotter.
[02:04:41.685 --> 02:04:46.386]  Everybody knows you go out at noon in July, and a clear day, you get burned.
[02:04:46.406 --> 02:04:49.167]  You go out in the winter, at noon you don't get burned, because you know.
[02:04:49.887 --> 02:04:51.308]  We're tilted towards the sun.
[02:04:51.348 --> 02:04:51.748]  It's hot.
[02:04:51.908 --> 02:04:52.868]  That's what drives it.
[02:04:53.369 --> 02:04:54.529]  Conspiracy theorists.
[02:04:55.089 --> 02:05:02.873]  By the way, after the Drudge interview, we're going to have David Knight live with Bill Maher attacking so much more.
[02:05:02.953 --> 02:05:04.013]  Leanne's got a big report.
[02:05:04.053 --> 02:05:04.814]  It's all coming up.
[02:05:05.114 --> 02:05:07.555]  Please tell your friends and family to tune in because they don't want you listening.
[02:05:08.757 --> 02:05:13.599]  Russia and Egypt still refuse to acknowledge that a terrorist attack could have taken down a Russian jet plane.
[02:05:13.859 --> 02:05:20.442]  But that's not stopping neocon warmonger John Bolton to lick his chops at the prospect of Russian retaliation.
[02:05:20.662 --> 02:05:28.005]  If it turns out that ISIS is responsible for downing this plane, that is the single biggest mistake they have ever made.
[02:05:28.085 --> 02:05:30.406]  Because Putin now will retaliate.
[02:05:30.706 --> 02:05:33.647]  And he won't mess around like President Obama has done.
[02:05:34.048 --> 02:05:37.309]  It will be, I think, extraordinarily massive.
[02:05:37.609 --> 02:05:37.869]  U.S.
[02:05:37.889 --> 02:05:38.370]  and U.K.
[02:05:38.410 --> 02:05:41.652]  intelligence officials are of the belief that a bomb took down the plane.
[02:05:41.772 --> 02:05:44.633]  But the president has remained silent on the cause of the disaster.
[02:05:44.874 --> 02:05:46.094]  One source tells the D.C.
[02:05:46.154 --> 02:05:51.498]  Whisper's website that there are concerns that the Muslim Brotherhood is responsible for the terror attack.
[02:05:51.658 --> 02:06:05.046]  The Muslim Brotherhood has enjoyed close ties with the administration in the past, and the source suggests measures are being taken by administration officials to make certain no such connection, if in fact it exists, will become part of the investigation.
[02:06:05.646 --> 02:06:08.088]  Read more now at InfoWars.com.
[02:06:08.548 --> 02:06:13.992]  Your liver can be full of fatty deposits, built-up toxins, and even dangerous objects known as liver stones.

[02:07:11.528 --> 02:07:20.915]  And it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and help children focus.
[02:07:21.255 --> 02:07:23.797]  All of our children are hit with modern mind control.
[02:07:23.957 --> 02:07:27.340]  Television, music, fast food, GMOs, sugars, you name it.
[02:07:27.520 --> 02:07:33.544]  Young humans have not yet developed their nervous system and are being hammered daily by globalist concoctions.
[02:07:33.844 --> 02:07:38.688]  It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down and then are put on dangerous psychotropic drugs.
[02:07:38.968 --> 02:07:45.151]  Working with my team we set out to find the best formula with the highest quality ingredients that children would actually like and take.
[02:07:45.351 --> 02:07:52.834]  We worked with the leading manufacturer in nutritional supplements that are safe for children to bring you the most affordable and powerful calming formula out there.
[02:07:53.094 --> 02:08:00.377]  Introducing Child Ease with herbs and calming extracts like chamomile and lemon balm and essential nutrients that taste great.

[02:08:04.238 --> 02:08:07.200]  That's Child Ease exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:08:24.326 --> 02:08:26.127]  What if you were unable to wake from that dream?
[02:08:26.147 --> 02:08:30.189]  How would you know the difference between the dream world and the real world?
[02:08:34.891 --> 02:08:36.572]  The answer is out there, Neo.
[02:08:36.932 --> 02:08:38.533]  It's the question that drives us.
[02:08:38.593 --> 02:08:41.375]  What is the Matrix?
[02:08:43.216 --> 02:08:47.438]  The Matrix is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth.
[02:08:47.558 --> 02:08:49.039]  What truth?
[02:08:58.215 --> 02:09:03.177]  They estimated that they would have to eliminate 25 million people in these re-education centers.
[02:09:03.277 --> 02:09:05.338]  And when I say eliminate, I mean kill.
[02:09:11.781 --> 02:09:14.903]  The Matrix is a system, Neo.
[02:09:15.163 --> 02:09:16.643]  That system is our enemy.
[02:09:16.924 --> 02:09:19.865]  When you're inside, you look around, what do you see?
[02:09:19.885 --> 02:09:22.066]  Businessmen, teachers, lawyers.
[02:09:23.979 --> 02:09:26.421]  The very minds of the people we are trying to save.
[02:09:26.882 --> 02:09:31.626]  But until we do, these people are still a part of that system, and that makes them our enemy.
[02:09:31.646 --> 02:09:36.510]  You have to understand, most of these people are not ready to be unplugged.
[02:09:37.351 --> 02:09:43.317]  And many of them are so in urge, so hopelessly dependent on the system, that they will fight to protect it.
[02:09:45.140 --> 02:09:47.263]  We are trained to deceive if we have to.
[02:09:47.303 --> 02:09:48.064]  You shouldn't trust me.
[02:09:48.184 --> 02:09:49.146]  I will taint the news.
[02:09:49.246 --> 02:09:51.248]  Our propaganda was beginning to pay off.
[02:09:51.549 --> 02:09:54.273]  And our lord and savior, Barack Obama!
[02:09:57.513 --> 02:10:01.734]  Genetically modified sounds Frankenstein-ish.
[02:10:01.754 --> 02:10:05.555]  Drought resistance sounds really something you'd want.
[02:10:05.595 --> 02:10:08.016]  I am not a dictator, I'm the president.
[02:10:08.036 --> 02:10:13.417]  This is a full, dishonorable, scientific mafia warfare takedown.
[02:10:13.837 --> 02:10:15.758]  Public policy could itself
[02:10:16.478 --> 02:10:20.321]  Become the captive of a scientific technological elite.
[02:10:20.441 --> 02:10:22.482]  These people are coming for everybody!
[02:10:22.762 --> 02:10:24.683]  I'm not gonna wait around to be soft killed.
[02:10:24.743 --> 02:10:27.005]  I'm not gonna wait around and watch my family die around me.
[02:10:27.045 --> 02:10:29.186]  I'm gonna die fighting!
[02:10:29.206 --> 02:10:30.066]  Take the blue pill.
[02:10:30.927 --> 02:10:31.747]  The story ends.
[02:10:32.728 --> 02:10:35.270]  You wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe.
[02:10:36.150 --> 02:10:37.131]  You take the red pill.
[02:10:37.711 --> 02:10:38.812]  You stay in Wonderland.
[02:10:40.353 --> 02:10:42.614]  And I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes.
[02:10:47.023 --> 02:10:48.704]  The Alex Jones Show.
[02:10:49.124 --> 02:10:54.506]  Because there is a war on for your mind.
[02:10:54.526 --> 02:10:56.067]  Stop being a moron.
[02:10:56.787 --> 02:10:58.628]  Stop being dishonorable.
[02:10:58.688 --> 02:11:04.551]  Within 15 years they say, CNN, that everyone will be merged with machines, or will be obsolete.
[02:11:17.476 --> 02:11:20.078]  Alright folks, Alex Jones here back live, well into the third hour.
[02:11:20.098 --> 02:11:22.379]  I did not do this as a stunt, neither did Matt Drudge.
[02:11:22.419 --> 02:11:23.060]  He is here.
[02:11:23.660 --> 02:11:27.182]  We got a hot mic over there, he wants to stay literally in the shadows behind a curtain.
[02:11:28.143 --> 02:11:32.906]  But this is the king of being able to push a story out and make it the number one story in the world.
[02:11:32.946 --> 02:11:42.051]  They even admit that in the New York Times, that he has more readers on politics and news than Facebook, the New York Times, and the Washington Post, LA Times put together.
[02:11:42.411 --> 02:11:46.454]  He's got some of our stories where the shooter himself said he was on a bunch of drugs.
[02:11:47.294 --> 02:11:48.354]  He's linked to that today.
[02:11:48.775 --> 02:11:50.515]  And that's the story they don't want out there.
[02:11:50.575 --> 02:11:57.037]  Or the story where CNN took a mixed racial Christian hater and turned him into a right-wing white supremacist and turned him white.
[02:11:57.538 --> 02:12:06.901]  They don't want people knowing that, but Matt Drudge and his great crew can link to alternative stories, foreign stories, mainstream stories, photos, mugshots.
[02:12:07.481 --> 02:12:17.765]  And really just focus on what Matt Drudge thinks is interesting, and the public tends to agree with him that what he focuses in on is really catching the zeitgeist or the pulse of the people.
[02:12:18.045 --> 02:12:23.727]  So he might have 50 links every day, where Facebook has 500 million, but he has more traffic.
[02:12:24.087 --> 02:12:28.849]  That is the true David versus Goliath story, and this is not scripted.
[02:12:28.969 --> 02:12:30.530]  I have no idea where I should go.
[02:12:31.350 --> 02:12:35.412]  Matt Drudge, I guess you're here for ACL, or why are you in Austin, Texas?
[02:12:36.516 --> 02:12:40.000]  Well, you were just talking about Facebook, and thanks again for having me here.
[02:12:40.881 --> 02:12:41.923]  I'm not on Facebook.
[02:12:43.404 --> 02:12:44.666]  I don't do the socials.
[02:12:44.806 --> 02:12:46.128]  I've got that little Twitter thing.
[02:12:46.208 --> 02:12:47.630]  Even that's kind of disgusting.
[02:12:48.689 --> 02:12:52.110]  You know, I've been doing the Internet as long as you've been doing this radio show, Alex.
[02:12:52.430 --> 02:12:56.211]  Literally every day, as you have literally every day, practically.
[02:12:56.251 --> 02:12:58.572]  I think you've taken a little more time off than I have, actually.
[02:12:58.692 --> 02:13:03.334]  Yes, I've kind of gone... And I can't say that about many people, because you are a peer without peer.
[02:13:04.294 --> 02:13:13.297]  And I'll tell you, I was there before Facebook, I was there before CNN.com, I was there before mostly all of them.
[02:13:14.177 --> 02:13:17.378]  I have a very clear perception what the Internet is.
[02:13:18.809 --> 02:13:19.449]  In my mind.
[02:13:19.769 --> 02:13:20.270]  I'm free.
[02:13:21.030 --> 02:13:23.931]  I'm not defined by what they say the Internet is.
[02:13:25.112 --> 02:13:31.834]  Meaning Goldman Sachs, meaning who they invest in for the latest startup, meaning the latest BuzzFeed or Salon or Gawker.
[02:13:32.074 --> 02:13:33.355]  Well, Gawker's more independent.
[02:13:33.855 --> 02:13:39.817]  But there's a lot of corporate makeover of the Internet that I have not adapted to.
[02:13:40.398 --> 02:13:41.338]  Simply put.
[02:13:42.718 --> 02:13:43.959]  I'm friends with some of them.
[02:13:44.019 --> 02:13:49.240]  When I go to New York, I make the 6th Avenue rounds, but I am not a part of that system.
[02:13:50.141 --> 02:13:51.021]  I'm a free thinker.
[02:13:51.081 --> 02:13:51.921]  I'm an American.
[02:13:51.941 --> 02:13:57.463]  I'm very concerned with what's happening.
[02:13:58.543 --> 02:14:00.064]  So I just give it my all.
[02:14:00.704 --> 02:14:05.766]  I've learned how to take care of myself and detach from outcomes because otherwise
[02:14:07.375 --> 02:14:08.156]  You can't survive.
[02:14:08.797 --> 02:14:10.378]  And I don't know where you are on that topic.
[02:14:10.638 --> 02:14:18.266]  I just follow my instinct because they always tell us how to adapt to be successful, but really we're just adapting to their mindset to be their slaves.
[02:14:18.386 --> 02:14:18.726]  I don't.
[02:14:18.787 --> 02:14:19.207]  No, you don't.
[02:14:19.767 --> 02:14:24.052]  I have remained completely independent from all of them.
[02:14:24.913 --> 02:14:25.673]  All of them!
[02:14:26.414 --> 02:14:29.635]  I am not influenced by any of them.
[02:14:30.296 --> 02:14:31.996]  I need no traffic from Google.
[02:14:32.337 --> 02:14:38.759]  I don't care if I get one traffic referral from Google, or Bing, or Yahoo, or any of these others.
[02:14:39.059 --> 02:14:40.020]  It's always been that way.
[02:14:40.836 --> 02:14:48.042]  Now if you think of that setup, how rare that is, because everybody's so hungry for referrals, for likes.
[02:14:48.903 --> 02:14:49.944]  I don't need to be liked.
[02:14:50.525 --> 02:14:51.666]  I don't need to be liked at all.
[02:14:51.986 --> 02:14:55.729]  I don't care if there's a button right there at the top of Drudge saying like or dislike.
[02:14:56.310 --> 02:14:57.931]  Thumbs up, thumbs down, doesn't mean anything.
[02:14:58.912 --> 02:15:03.877]  Now, I hope that you come, doesn't mean you necessarily have to like what I have up there.
[02:15:04.659 --> 02:15:08.122]  Now, where I've had a lot of success is I'm getting people from both sides of the aisle.
[02:15:08.883 --> 02:15:14.328]  They've always said, oh, he's a right-wing gossip monger, mainly because of Lewinsky in those years, which, by the way, are back.
[02:15:15.269 --> 02:15:16.770]  Why aren't we seeing Hillary's lovers?
[02:15:18.151 --> 02:15:18.592]  Excuse me.
[02:15:19.072 --> 02:15:20.574]  Why aren't we seeing Hillary's lovers?
[02:15:20.614 --> 02:15:21.314]  That's a good question.
[02:15:21.995 --> 02:15:23.216]  Where's the cover-up on this?
[02:15:25.058 --> 02:15:28.401]  So many issues that are suppressed on a daily basis.
[02:15:29.062 --> 02:15:30.443]  So that's what I try to do every morning.
[02:15:31.795 --> 02:15:32.336]  Incredible.
[02:15:32.416 --> 02:15:38.081]  Well, it's amazing to have you here in Austin, Texas, and I tell you, you certainly know how to make an entrance.
[02:15:38.221 --> 02:15:44.167]  I'm in a 70-second break, and I turn around, and there's Matt Drudge, just boom.
[02:15:45.548 --> 02:15:47.691]  I tell you, I almost had a heart attack, a good one.
[02:15:48.671 --> 02:15:50.433]  My cousin said he's never seen me look like that.
[02:15:50.994 --> 02:15:52.255]  What was the word, Buckley, you used?
[02:15:53.736 --> 02:15:54.857]  No, no, it's flabbergasted.
[02:15:55.822 --> 02:15:57.042]  I was flabbergasted.
[02:15:57.182 --> 02:15:58.463]  You used the word flabbergasted.
[02:15:58.483 --> 02:16:03.924]  Well, I tell you, this is like the biggest Christmas present early ever, because I just admire true independence.
[02:16:04.544 --> 02:16:16.608]  And I got to tell you, Matt, and you know this with your crew, and Congress knows this, we wouldn't have won some of these gun battles, some of these border battles, some of these energy battles, and we've lost some too, but we would have lost so many of them if it wasn't for the focal point
[02:16:17.108 --> 02:16:20.993]  And even the White House and the Democrats admit that I know you're saying you're nonpartisan.
[02:16:21.053 --> 02:16:22.575]  I mean, I would guess you're more of a libertarian.
[02:16:22.895 --> 02:16:23.476]  Correct me if I'm wrong.
[02:16:23.496 --> 02:16:24.317]  You're just a freedom guy.
[02:16:24.397 --> 02:16:25.698]  I can't be controlled.
[02:16:26.239 --> 02:16:28.261]  I cannot be controlled.
[02:16:28.862 --> 02:16:32.686]  There are no interests here but what I see as the world events.
[02:16:33.267 --> 02:16:33.868]  Period.
[02:16:34.469 --> 02:16:36.331]  That is the truth of the situation.
[02:16:36.351 --> 02:16:37.252]  Well, they hate the fact
[02:16:37.552 --> 02:16:39.213]  That they can't control the agenda.
[02:16:39.373 --> 02:16:47.836]  The Pentagon has briefings with the head of PSYOPS, as you know, saying, we've got to stop drudge changing the subject and showing when we're lying.
[02:16:47.896 --> 02:16:50.697]  I mean, that's when you know, that's, I mean, that's crazy town.
[02:16:50.897 --> 02:16:52.037]  When you get, what is it like?
[02:16:52.077 --> 02:16:56.699]  Is it surreal to think back to something you started back in the early 90s has now grown into this?
[02:16:56.919 --> 02:16:58.559]  Well, no, because it's been every day.
[02:16:58.680 --> 02:16:59.420]  So it's just like,
[02:17:00.260 --> 02:17:02.182]  It's happened so organically.
[02:17:02.402 --> 02:17:03.563]  It started with one reader.
[02:17:03.983 --> 02:17:05.365]  I don't know who that one reader was.
[02:17:05.765 --> 02:17:06.946]  But it started with one reader.
[02:17:06.986 --> 02:17:08.567]  I've never placed an ad anywhere.
[02:17:09.248 --> 02:17:09.448]  Ever.
[02:17:10.549 --> 02:17:14.733]  This has all been a true organic reader to reader to reader to reader.
[02:17:15.173 --> 02:17:20.678]  Yes, I dabbled in the corporate with the Fox News Show and the Clear Channel Radio Show for nine years.
[02:17:21.715 --> 02:17:28.160]  But even that, the website was on its own terms, and remains so to this very minute.
[02:17:28.180 --> 02:17:32.403]  Well, you've only gotten bigger since you stopped... Well, I don't know, because this is another thing.
[02:17:33.283 --> 02:17:36.125]  The measurements that we have, this is another bogus thing.
[02:17:36.165 --> 02:17:40.268]  Yesterday they released on the APA Wire, Twitter followers.
[02:17:41.169 --> 02:17:44.771]  Hillary is the queen of the Twitters, with 4.9 million.
[02:17:44.791 --> 02:17:46.031]  They don't say how many are fake.
[02:17:46.372 --> 02:17:47.492]  They don't say how many are true.
[02:17:47.512 --> 02:17:49.333]  They admit the first ladies is like 80% fake.
[02:17:49.353 --> 02:17:51.154]  Well, the AP did not do that, Alex.
[02:17:51.214 --> 02:17:54.796]  So this whole thing, this whole socials, these socials.
[02:17:55.456 --> 02:18:03.440]  You know, Beats 1 Music, which I'm obsessed with, which has been launched on Apple, which is probably one of the best things they've done since Steve Jobs died.
[02:18:03.980 --> 02:18:04.801]  One radio station.
[02:18:05.581 --> 02:18:06.122]  Interesting.
[02:18:06.402 --> 02:18:08.065]  They don't know how many listeners they have.
[02:18:08.125 --> 02:18:10.768]  I heard some streams they were down to 5,000 an hour.
[02:18:11.409 --> 02:18:14.333]  This whole social media stuff is bogus.
[02:18:14.674 --> 02:18:17.638]  Facebook, we have 2 billion users.
[02:18:18.379 --> 02:18:19.560]  This is garbage.
[02:18:19.901 --> 02:18:23.466]  This is designed to demoralize the individual.
[02:18:23.866 --> 02:18:25.867]  I'll never have 2 billion followers.
[02:18:26.708 --> 02:18:28.108]  The Internet is what you make of it.
[02:18:28.428 --> 02:18:29.989]  It's the same battle as it was in the beginning.
[02:18:30.009 --> 02:18:33.131]  I remember having this argument with Brit Hume once, live on C-SPAN.
[02:18:33.151 --> 02:18:37.113]  He goes, oh, the Internet's all UFOs and all this crap.
[02:18:37.153 --> 02:18:38.694]  And I said, no, the Internet is what you make of it.
[02:18:38.794 --> 02:18:41.035]  In the beginning, they were dismissing the Internet.
[02:18:41.115 --> 02:18:42.116]  They were poo-pooing it.
[02:18:42.356 --> 02:18:46.498]  And isn't that good for us that for so long they were in arrogant denial?
[02:18:46.778 --> 02:18:49.219]  And they seem like they still kind of are in arrogant denial.
[02:18:49.499 --> 02:18:51.721]  No, now they make it over in their image.
[02:18:52.481 --> 02:18:55.202]  Now it's these endless, monotonous tweets.
[02:18:55.822 --> 02:18:56.483]  Meaningless!
[02:18:57.183 --> 02:18:57.863]  Meaningless!
[02:18:59.184 --> 02:19:01.805]  To me, it's just a lot of gnats.
[02:19:02.485 --> 02:19:03.726]  A lot of confusion.
[02:19:04.186 --> 02:19:08.428]  When the reality of the situation is, life on Earth has not changed.
[02:19:08.868 --> 02:19:10.008]  We need facts.
[02:19:10.529 --> 02:19:11.249]  We need events.
[02:19:11.689 --> 02:19:13.290]  We need specifics on things.
[02:19:13.690 --> 02:19:15.571]  Not all this confusion.
[02:19:15.611 --> 02:19:18.092]  It's almost they've made the Internet over in their image.
[02:19:18.812 --> 02:19:19.573]  These corporations.
[02:19:19.633 --> 02:19:20.634]  And I think they're failing.
[02:19:20.654 --> 02:19:21.514]  Skip the break.
[02:19:21.775 --> 02:19:22.295]  Skip the break.
[02:19:22.395 --> 02:19:23.116]  Oh, sorry, Matt.
[02:19:23.136 --> 02:19:23.476]  Go ahead.
[02:19:23.536 --> 02:19:24.377]  I had to interrupt.
[02:19:24.397 --> 02:19:25.318]  You say you think they're failing?
[02:19:25.878 --> 02:19:26.739]  I think they're failing.
[02:19:27.179 --> 02:19:31.983]  To the point, this is a whole nother discussion on how sick are the American people right now.
[02:19:32.384 --> 02:19:37.948]  I've been saying they could put Hillary Clinton's brain in a jar in the Oval Office and she'd be elected.
[02:19:38.409 --> 02:19:39.269]  People are really sick.
[02:19:39.810 --> 02:19:43.813]  I think you know this deep in your soul and this is why you get demoralized here on this very set.
[02:19:43.933 --> 02:19:44.814]  Yeah, I shouldn't.
[02:19:44.854 --> 02:19:46.235]  People are sick.
[02:19:47.256 --> 02:19:55.975]  How they've got here, you've been done a wonderful arc over almost decades now, explaining why people are and have become so sick.
[02:19:56.983 --> 02:20:02.046]  That being said, people are willing to be made over in the image of these corporations.
[02:20:02.446 --> 02:20:08.710]  The reason there's so much anger online also is a newspaper like the Washington Post will leave a comment section.
[02:20:09.051 --> 02:20:10.351]  They don't care what you're saying.
[02:20:10.371 --> 02:20:12.493]  They don't care what you're thinking.
[02:20:12.513 --> 02:20:21.058]  That's why you get this anger that, I have to be, I'm out here as a citizen and I'm operating in their playground.
[02:20:21.458 --> 02:20:22.799]  Make your own playground.
[02:20:23.119 --> 02:20:25.341]  The reason I'm here, Alex, is you've made your own.
[02:20:26.445 --> 02:20:29.906]  Playground, this is a figment of your imagination.
[02:20:30.766 --> 02:20:32.487]  And the Drudge Report is mine.
[02:20:32.987 --> 02:20:35.867]  It is a very simple thesis.
[02:20:36.468 --> 02:20:39.028]  You are what you dream you are and become.
[02:20:39.368 --> 02:20:44.730]  And I wish Americans would get out of the sickness and just become greater.
[02:20:45.590 --> 02:20:46.511]  Well, that's profound.
[02:20:46.571 --> 02:20:54.596]  I mean, because if we start creating our own maps, our own world, our own vision, then there's no way for these cultural tyrants to program us.
[02:20:54.656 --> 02:20:57.918]  And that's why they're pushing so hard to get more outrageous.
[02:20:58.178 --> 02:20:59.679]  I mean, is this the beginning of the end?
[02:20:59.900 --> 02:21:02.501]  And to operate in their playgrounds.
[02:21:03.142 --> 02:21:05.423]  So, you become famous on YouTube.
[02:21:06.304 --> 02:21:06.984]  That's ridiculous.
[02:21:07.004 --> 02:21:07.685]  I'm not saying you.
[02:21:07.825 --> 02:21:12.308]  I'm saying the 13-year-old that just died that they're saying is the first YouTube star that died.
[02:21:12.762 --> 02:21:15.303]  You're playing in Google's hell pit.
[02:21:16.024 --> 02:21:17.024]  No, I agree, but I'm invaded.
[02:21:17.064 --> 02:21:18.525]  Make your own place.
[02:21:18.805 --> 02:21:19.846]  Make your own.
[02:21:20.126 --> 02:21:24.628]  The Internet allows you to make your own dynamic, your own universe.
[02:21:25.048 --> 02:21:29.030]  Why are you gravitating towards somebody else's universe?
[02:21:29.410 --> 02:21:34.053]  And this is kind of, again, where drudge to me, when I look at it right now, is a correction
[02:21:35.017 --> 02:21:39.039]  To this groupthink that has- I totally agree with what you're saying.
[02:21:39.059 --> 02:21:40.900]  There's no difference from any of these websites.
[02:21:40.960 --> 02:21:42.661]  You go up and down.
[02:21:42.721 --> 02:21:43.682]  We talk about this.
[02:21:44.122 --> 02:21:45.963]  What's the difference between the websites?
[02:21:46.324 --> 02:21:50.586]  Between a Slate or a Salon or a Buzzfeed or a HuffPo?
[02:21:50.626 --> 02:21:52.067]  What is the difference?
[02:21:52.587 --> 02:21:53.428]  There isn't any.
[02:21:54.068 --> 02:21:55.929]  And this is a travesty.
[02:21:56.389 --> 02:22:04.113]  It's almost like a weird conglomerate of groupthink that has developed in a dynamic era that should be vibrating.
[02:22:04.553 --> 02:22:06.494]  It should be vibrating, it should be controversial.
[02:22:07.523 --> 02:22:08.644]  But I guess it's fear.
[02:22:10.324 --> 02:22:17.108]  Not everybody is cut from the same genetic background as you or I, Alex, of being brave and being able to stand up.
[02:22:17.128 --> 02:22:18.168]  You're on the camera.
[02:22:18.208 --> 02:22:18.628]  I'm not.
[02:22:18.708 --> 02:22:19.789]  You're more brave than I am.
[02:22:20.549 --> 02:22:22.790]  So this is the dynamic that I'm in.
[02:22:22.890 --> 02:22:24.191]  I would just like to wake people up.
[02:22:24.611 --> 02:22:27.832]  Stop operating in their playground.
[02:22:28.212 --> 02:22:28.633]  Stop it.
[02:22:28.853 --> 02:22:29.453]  Well, let me say this.
[02:22:29.513 --> 02:22:30.733]  I totally agree with you.
[02:22:31.193 --> 02:22:31.814]  I've tried.
[02:22:32.014 --> 02:22:35.755]  I couldn't pay for the bandwidth to put all of our videos out on our own platforms.
[02:22:35.855 --> 02:22:45.719]  Now we're doing that at PrisonPlanet.tv and the Nightly News and putting ourselves up on television to reach people because it's kind of like jacking into the Matrix, going into their playground.
[02:22:46.099 --> 02:22:50.080]  I try to then claw them over here to see what we're trying to do, what you're trying to do.
[02:22:50.361 --> 02:22:51.341]  But I totally agree with you.
[02:22:51.641 --> 02:23:05.185]  The answer is for all of us to create our own systems, our own ideas, because vibrant, independent ideas will trump this corporate plastic borg, this brainwashing they're trying to push.
[02:23:05.225 --> 02:23:08.886]  I mean, banning father and mother, banning the word husband and wife.
[02:23:08.906 --> 02:23:15.127]  I mean, that's so cultic that if I'd have been told ten years ago they were going to ban words like that, I wouldn't have believed it.
[02:23:15.427 --> 02:23:16.768]  They do it with straight faces.
[02:23:17.928 --> 02:23:24.893]  Has the left, and of course the controlled right as well, but have they gone collectively insane on a control freak bent?
[02:23:25.133 --> 02:23:26.554]  Or is there a strategy?
[02:23:26.614 --> 02:23:30.196]  I would also advise people to not waste their time on this.
[02:23:30.296 --> 02:23:33.759]  I had a Supreme Court Justice tell me to my face, it's over for me.
[02:23:35.302 --> 02:23:36.363]  Said Matt, it's over for you.
[02:23:36.703 --> 02:23:38.906]  They've got the votes now to enforce copyright law.
[02:23:39.186 --> 02:23:39.787]  You're out of there.
[02:23:40.427 --> 02:23:42.750]  They're going to make it so headlines you can't even use headlines.
[02:23:43.751 --> 02:23:47.715]  To have a Supreme Court justice say that to my face, that it's over.
[02:23:48.175 --> 02:23:51.499]  They've got the votes, which means time is limited.
[02:23:51.839 --> 02:23:53.160]  Time is not forever.
[02:23:54.001 --> 02:23:57.124]  How many more moons and sunrises will you see in your life?
[02:23:57.925 --> 02:23:58.946]  Uh, rise and fall.
[02:23:59.146 --> 02:24:00.127]  There's not that many.
[02:24:00.247 --> 02:24:01.748]  It's a small amount.
[02:24:02.249 --> 02:24:07.813]  So for people to be saying with this attitude, oh, I'll get on with my life and my greatness sometime.
[02:24:07.913 --> 02:24:08.133]  No.
[02:24:08.373 --> 02:24:09.214]  No, you can't.
[02:24:09.314 --> 02:24:11.216]  We're being enslaved now, and that's it.
[02:24:11.396 --> 02:24:16.320]  Under the TPP, they admit you can't put a headline to the New York Times.
[02:24:16.600 --> 02:24:18.601]  You're sending massive traffic to them.
[02:24:18.942 --> 02:24:21.403]  They're claiming you're taking their words.
[02:24:21.664 --> 02:24:22.464]  This is insane.
[02:24:22.524 --> 02:24:25.727]  And you had the Justice Stephen Breyer said we need to look at a global law.
[02:24:26.067 --> 02:24:28.308]  Now, remember just recently- Getting it lined up with it.
[02:24:28.548 --> 02:24:31.008]  So they're getting ready for these decisions to come.
[02:24:31.028 --> 02:24:32.689]  You thought Obamacare was shocking.
[02:24:33.049 --> 02:24:34.849]  You thought some of these other decisions were shocking.
[02:24:34.909 --> 02:24:45.652]  Wait until these copyright laws work their way up and the Supreme Court decides you cannot have a website with news headlines linking across the board.
[02:24:46.232 --> 02:24:47.673]  Then that will end for me.
[02:24:47.933 --> 02:24:49.594]  Fine, I've had a hell of a run.
[02:24:49.655 --> 02:24:52.176]  It's 20 years next year or 20 years about now.
[02:24:52.396 --> 02:24:53.037]  Hell of a run.
[02:24:53.177 --> 02:24:55.499]  I couldn't have gone any further.
[02:24:55.959 --> 02:25:00.903]  I feel completely I have gone as far out of the galaxy as I can on this.
[02:25:01.003 --> 02:25:06.246]  I still want to stay out here, but I've gone pretty damn far for what one individual can do in this culture.
[02:25:06.667 --> 02:25:07.968]  But I'm talking about the future.
[02:25:08.248 --> 02:25:13.612]  So I don't know why they've been successful in pushing everybody into these little ghettos.
[02:25:14.312 --> 02:25:19.033]  Of these Facebooks, and these Tweets, and these Instagrams, these Instas.
[02:25:19.653 --> 02:25:20.894]  This is ghetto!
[02:25:21.254 --> 02:25:22.014]  This is ghetto!
[02:25:22.054 --> 02:25:23.174]  This is corporate!
[02:25:23.214 --> 02:25:25.535]  They're taking your energy!
[02:25:25.995 --> 02:25:28.315]  They're taking your energy and you're getting nothing in return!
[02:25:28.695 --> 02:25:29.036]  Nothing!
[02:25:29.076 --> 02:25:30.316]  They're dumbing the language down!
[02:25:30.516 --> 02:25:33.217]  Twitter's designed to reduce the language directly out of 1984!
[02:25:33.297 --> 02:25:33.577]  It's Ingsoc!
[02:25:35.569 --> 02:25:44.792]  Right, ultimately it's boring and the kids are always off to something new, except for the something new is owned by the same freaking company or financed by the same banking system.
[02:25:45.312 --> 02:25:56.195]  So I'm here to say, and this is the reason why I came to see you, Alex, is you are one of the very few who are operating under this theory to be an independent American.
[02:25:57.475 --> 02:26:01.597]  In a big way, if your calling is media, fine.
[02:26:01.637 --> 02:26:03.478]  If your calling is sports, whatever it is.
[02:26:04.018 --> 02:26:10.582]  But you've got to be the greatest you can be now, now, before this country is so completely fractured.
[02:26:10.802 --> 02:26:16.564]  And we're left with Hillary's brain in the Oval Office in a jar, because that's what we're getting.
[02:26:16.925 --> 02:26:18.385]  She's old and she's sick.
[02:26:18.665 --> 02:26:19.806]  She's not a contender.
[02:26:20.266 --> 02:26:24.048]  They're making her a contender with these propped up Saturday Night Live things.
[02:26:24.468 --> 02:26:25.529]  It's like a head on a stick.
[02:26:26.289 --> 02:26:29.452]  And then on the Today Show with the Gun 3, a head on a stick.
[02:26:30.452 --> 02:26:38.879]  She is not a viable, vibrant leader for this country of 300, including the illegals, 380 million Americans.
[02:26:39.520 --> 02:26:42.402]  So the media is trying to put us to sleep.
[02:26:43.143 --> 02:26:44.224]  You're not letting them, Alex.
[02:26:44.344 --> 02:26:45.505]  Let me ask you this question, Matt.
[02:26:46.999 --> 02:26:51.385]  Is the establishment, which we know is diverse, but there's different conglomerates, is it panicking?
[02:26:51.866 --> 02:26:55.010]  Is it trying to push everything through right now because it knows people are waking up?
[02:26:55.451 --> 02:26:56.492]  Or is it just completely...
[02:26:57.702 --> 02:26:58.962]  Arrogant and thinks it's invincible.
[02:26:59.322 --> 02:27:03.863]  It's trying to consolidate control, yes, and there is a sense of panic about it.
[02:27:04.524 --> 02:27:08.124]  You look at a Telemundo or a Univision, they're kind of panicked.
[02:27:08.565 --> 02:27:18.387]  You look at some of these interviews that are happening this election cycle where Trump comes along, says a few things, just a few things, and soars to the top of the list.
[02:27:19.187 --> 02:27:20.188]  That's profound.
[02:27:20.588 --> 02:27:27.373]  Imagine if we actually had a good selection of candidates who are saying a lot, and I know Cruz and Rand and all the rest.
[02:27:27.953 --> 02:27:31.756]  However, you've got to be dynamic in this atmosphere, and it's a media country.
[02:27:32.036 --> 02:27:33.577]  You've got to be dynamic in media.
[02:27:33.777 --> 02:27:35.218]  That's the only thing that's going to work.
[02:27:35.819 --> 02:27:43.184]  So I am left with thinking there's not a lot of time to be your greatest self, especially online.
[02:27:43.664 --> 02:27:47.587]  Because if it continues to get consolidated to this degree,
[02:27:48.207 --> 02:27:51.129]  And then we're moving into the robots, which you're so profound on.
[02:27:51.669 --> 02:27:54.451]  And it's going to get really ugly, really fast.
[02:27:54.471 --> 02:27:58.294]  There's already automated news sites, Google News, hello anybody.
[02:27:58.594 --> 02:28:02.416]  They actually, the idiots reading that crap, think there is actually a human there.
[02:28:02.737 --> 02:28:04.478]  There is no human there.
[02:28:04.858 --> 02:28:09.001]  You are being programmed to being automated, even up to your news.
[02:28:09.441 --> 02:28:11.902]  And Apple News, I don't know what that's about.
[02:28:12.002 --> 02:28:13.103]  That was also creepy.
[02:28:13.644 --> 02:28:16.966]  A same corporate glaze over everything.
[02:28:17.606 --> 02:28:18.808]  I don't see the world that way.
[02:28:18.948 --> 02:28:24.114]  I live in a world that's free, colorful, vibrant, takes chances, bold, stands up to power.
[02:28:25.055 --> 02:28:26.477]  And that's where I've made my success.
[02:28:28.150 --> 02:28:29.931]  Well, very eloquently said.
[02:28:29.951 --> 02:28:42.197]  I mean, really, if we don't affect the battle space, if we don't get involved in free speech now, that's all you the listeners, all the Drudge fans, fans of freedom, no matter what color you are, no matter what political bent, we're going to lose everything.
[02:28:42.477 --> 02:28:44.158]  We know what totalitarian looks like.
[02:28:44.218 --> 02:28:45.938]  We know what oppression looks like.
[02:28:45.978 --> 02:28:49.960]  We know what the dumb culture of totalitarianism smells like.
[02:28:50.340 --> 02:28:51.021]  This is it.
[02:28:51.701 --> 02:28:55.384]  It's happening now, and the future of the world is being decided.
[02:28:55.444 --> 02:28:58.086]  So get out there, make your own sites, take action.
[02:28:58.106 --> 02:29:00.007]  Because Matt, you say you'll just go away if they do this.
[02:29:00.287 --> 02:29:01.408]  We all know we're gonna fight it.
[02:29:01.688 --> 02:29:02.909]  We know they can't enforce it.
[02:29:03.229 --> 02:29:06.212]  Because if they can say that you can't even put a link up to a news site...
[02:29:06.992 --> 02:29:09.673]  Then that ends free speech and basic communication.
[02:29:10.013 --> 02:29:17.115]  I mean, I know they got the Democrats out openly saying, we need to bring in the Fairness Doctrine to the Internet because of Matt Drudge, because you, quote, affect elections.
[02:29:17.315 --> 02:29:21.556]  Well, you're an American citizen that pays taxes, and you're allowed to be pro-gun.
[02:29:21.596 --> 02:29:26.417]  Well, but if they get enough sick people to elect it, the demographics will take care of themselves.
[02:29:26.457 --> 02:29:35.620]  We had a story this morning that they're finally releasing an artist in Cuba who painted Raul and Fidel as a pig, jailed without trial.
[02:29:36.320 --> 02:29:37.141]  For 18 months.
[02:29:37.361 --> 02:29:40.322]  Look at Germany, where they're arresting people that criticize open borders.
[02:29:40.362 --> 02:29:42.223]  Look, you've been- So it's already happening.
[02:29:42.243 --> 02:29:49.968]  I'm just warning this country that, yes, don't get into this false sense that you are an individual when you're on Facebook.
[02:29:50.468 --> 02:29:52.369]  No, you're not.
[02:29:52.909 --> 02:29:54.850]  You're a pawn in their scheme.
[02:29:54.890 --> 02:29:55.190]  Stay there.
[02:29:55.210 --> 02:29:57.011]  We gotta come right back for a few more minutes and say bye.
[02:29:57.031 --> 02:29:57.732]  This is incredible.
[02:29:58.172 --> 02:29:59.753]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:30:00.693 --> 02:30:03.375]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:08.931 --> 02:30:17.593]  Almost immediately following the crash of Russian metro jet flight 9268, a militant group affiliated to ISIS in Egypt claimed responsibility.
[02:30:17.833 --> 02:30:23.795]  However, many groups, including Russian officials, expressed their initial skepticism that ISIS could achieve such a thing.
[02:30:24.075 --> 02:30:31.217]  Well now, according to US officials, an ISIS bomb is the most likely reason behind the Russian jet crash that killed 224 people.
[02:30:33.217 --> 02:30:39.742]  An official said, there is a definite feeling it was an explosive device planted in luggage or somewhere on the plane.
[02:30:39.982 --> 02:30:48.088]  Europe has announced that those attempting to fly from Sharm el-Sheikh to the United Kingdom will experience delays as authorities work to provide more security.
[02:30:48.348 --> 02:30:52.972]  No doubt, Europe will soon be implementing its own version of TSA security theater.
[02:30:53.352 --> 02:30:55.514]  That's clearly meant to control the populace.
[02:30:55.974 --> 02:31:02.217]  Because as we've seen, European borders are wide open for any wannabe terrorists traveling by foot.
[02:31:02.437 --> 02:31:05.699]  You can read more right now at InfoWars.com.
[02:31:08.721 --> 02:31:10.121]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[02:31:10.382 --> 02:31:11.662]  You can't survive without it.

[02:33:20.143 --> 02:33:22.384]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:33:22.825 --> 02:33:24.586]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:24.686 --> 02:33:29.349]  It's the time of the season.
[02:33:30.289 --> 02:33:32.130]  When love runs high.
[02:33:32.971 --> 02:33:36.253]  In this time, give it to me easy.
[02:33:38.345 --> 02:33:42.369]  Well, I tell you, a lot of energy entered the building.
[02:33:42.389 --> 02:33:43.751]  There's already a lot of energy in this building.
[02:33:44.812 --> 02:33:47.034]  A lot of smiles with Matt Drudge here.
[02:33:47.054 --> 02:33:49.697]  A don, I guess, went to the door.
[02:33:50.618 --> 02:33:52.940]  And, you know, we say don't let strangers in, but it was no stranger.
[02:33:53.160 --> 02:33:54.962]  Matt Drudge here in studio with us.
[02:33:56.364 --> 02:33:58.386]  And characteristically, very, uh...
[02:33:59.451 --> 02:34:02.575]  Kind of like Peter Pan, hard to catch, hard to find, moves quick.
[02:34:02.895 --> 02:34:06.520]  He is right over there in the dark with a handheld microphone.
[02:34:06.540 --> 02:34:11.366]  Of course, the conspiracy theories will begin that this isn't really Matt Drudge, but people can tell it is Matt Drudge.
[02:34:11.406 --> 02:34:14.370]  I've seen a lot of his speeches, heard him pop in on shows here and there.
[02:34:14.910 --> 02:34:16.911]  And it's always eloquent, always thought-provoking.
[02:34:16.931 --> 02:34:20.153]  This is particularly thought-provoking and will be a big newsmaker.
[02:34:20.533 --> 02:34:26.036]  They will attempt to control reality and say, how dare Matt Drudge hang out with that heretic Alex Jones?
[02:34:26.416 --> 02:34:31.278]  And we're always hearing over the last six, seven years that Matt Drudge is over, Matt Drudge doesn't exist.
[02:34:31.318 --> 02:34:33.219]  But then they have to admit Matt Drudge is bigger than ever.
[02:34:33.599 --> 02:34:40.803]  So this attempt to control reality or control who talks to who by these totalitarians that masquerade as liberals
[02:34:41.303 --> 02:34:42.283]  I don't think it's working.
[02:34:42.323 --> 02:34:48.145]  And now with Boehner being forced out, I think it shows the rumblings of the Tea Party beneath the surface.
[02:34:48.185 --> 02:34:56.547]  So, Matt, before you leave us, and I really appreciate your time... Oh, and by the way, the presidential candidates, that's exactly what you're saying, the rumblings.
[02:34:56.587 --> 02:35:01.948]  Look at anybody who has any form of success in the polls is because they rumble.
[02:35:03.309 --> 02:35:04.690]  Where it's going to end up, I don't know.
[02:35:04.750 --> 02:35:05.891]  I'm very pessimistic.
[02:35:06.251 --> 02:35:18.061]  I'm very pessimistic on this race because I'm just not so sure it's not going to end up with the dreaded brain in the jar in the Oval Office, once known as Hillary Clinton, who is hypothyroid.
[02:35:18.401 --> 02:35:23.645]  Anybody who is 70 years old who's hypothyroid, you do not elect president, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:35:23.865 --> 02:35:25.227]  You don't do it.
[02:35:25.627 --> 02:35:31.632]  Now they'll say, well, it has to be who her VP is, whether it's the Castro from San Antonio or the other Castro from San Antonio.
[02:35:32.032 --> 02:35:34.277]  Or the other caster from San Antonio, whoever it's gonna be.
[02:35:34.297 --> 02:35:42.074]  I'm just shaking now after seeing NBC giving her endless hours of airtime.
[02:35:43.163 --> 02:35:47.205]  Over the past 72 hours that Hillary's back, and she's back for real.
[02:35:47.786 --> 02:35:51.788]  Now, what that means to you or me, what it means to me, I've got a long history with these people.
[02:35:52.148 --> 02:36:01.554]  They're ugly, they play dirty, they sued me for $30 million last time around with the approval of the President, announced by the Press Secretary of the White House, a civil action.
[02:36:02.274 --> 02:36:07.818]  These people, and they didn't have the NSA then, they had Echelon, they had all these other things you were talking about even then.
[02:36:08.738 --> 02:36:10.741]  Hillary Clinton with the NSA?
[02:36:11.482 --> 02:36:13.164]  Good luck if you dissent.
[02:36:13.745 --> 02:36:15.528]  Good luck if you dissent.
[02:36:15.968 --> 02:36:17.530]  Snowden, I'll switch places with you.
[02:36:18.051 --> 02:36:20.935]  You can come over here and rot in hell, because that's what it's going to be.
[02:36:21.456 --> 02:36:25.622]  So I'm very concerned with the lay of the land, but the rumblings you're talking about
[02:36:26.303 --> 02:36:30.565]  That we've seen a Trump, that we've seen a Carly, that do we seen a Sanders?
[02:36:30.965 --> 02:36:33.906]  Yeah, maybe, also old, old.
[02:36:34.366 --> 02:36:36.467]  Can the Democrats find anybody under the age of 70?
[02:36:37.567 --> 02:36:42.289]  What is this oldness in a vibrant country that needs to go forward to a new century?
[02:36:42.649 --> 02:36:43.190]  So I don't know.
[02:36:43.930 --> 02:36:45.371]  I'm hoping for surprises.
[02:36:46.051 --> 02:36:47.271]  I'm hoping for some jolts.
[02:36:48.032 --> 02:36:48.632]  We'll have to see.
[02:36:49.804 --> 02:36:52.727]  On a few other subjects, and I appreciate your time, I'll quit bugging you.
[02:36:54.288 --> 02:36:55.889]  There's so much going on in the world.
[02:36:56.270 --> 02:36:59.973]  Obama now is talking about, well, Australia had a good plan, we may have to do that.
[02:37:00.413 --> 02:37:02.295]  That's clearly talking about gun confiscation.
[02:37:02.715 --> 02:37:03.836]  Now Hillary's doing it.
[02:37:04.196 --> 02:37:06.659]  CNN has pundits just saying, let's just take them.
[02:37:07.139 --> 02:37:10.342]  Do these people realize that this is the line in the sand at the Alamo?
[02:37:10.742 --> 02:37:15.766]  If they really come out in a frontal assault on guns, it means I think they're trying to start a civil war.
[02:37:16.846 --> 02:37:18.148]  It just seems like insanity.
[02:37:18.188 --> 02:37:21.553]  I mean, they may think that they're Stalin or something.
[02:37:21.994 --> 02:37:27.762]  Well, because they're all armed themselves, or they all have that security around them themselves.
[02:37:28.062 --> 02:37:29.845]  They don't have to worry about it.
[02:37:29.865 --> 02:37:32.689]  I challenge Hillary, take away your Secret Service.
[02:37:33.470 --> 02:37:34.410]  Take it away now.
[02:37:35.211 --> 02:37:36.771]  Take away your Secret Service.
[02:37:36.811 --> 02:37:37.612]  Dismiss them.
[02:37:38.132 --> 02:37:39.433]  Have no security around you.
[02:37:39.733 --> 02:37:41.173]  Have no guns around you, Hillary.
[02:37:41.493 --> 02:37:42.234]  I dare you.
[02:37:42.254 --> 02:37:43.394]  I dare you.
[02:37:43.714 --> 02:37:44.675]  Obama, same thing.
[02:37:45.295 --> 02:37:46.596]  Drop your guns, Obama.
[02:37:47.336 --> 02:37:49.277]  Take your Secret Service away, Obama.
[02:37:50.177 --> 02:37:51.318]  Take it all away.
[02:37:51.458 --> 02:37:53.358]  Leave the White House unguarded, Obama.
[02:37:53.719 --> 02:37:56.740]  Let everybody know there's no guns on the White House grounds, Obama.
[02:37:56.760 --> 02:37:58.641]  You know what would happen in 30 seconds?
[02:37:59.581 --> 02:38:01.562]  Both of those people would no longer be on planet Earth.
[02:38:02.475 --> 02:38:09.379]  So they're asking us to drop our guns and to drop our security measures, or what?
[02:38:09.859 --> 02:38:15.842]  So this thing is very real, and I don't see how it's being taken seriously, except for the sick voter.
[02:38:16.523 --> 02:38:19.284]  You can't underestimate the sickness of the American people right now.
[02:38:19.504 --> 02:38:20.185]  They're really sick.
[02:38:20.925 --> 02:38:24.347]  And that's to me, I'm more angry at the sick Americans than I am at Obama.
[02:38:24.927 --> 02:38:25.367]  Or Hillary.
[02:38:25.608 --> 02:38:27.149]  I'm really angry at the sick Americans.
[02:38:27.869 --> 02:38:34.495]  Matt Drudge, I used to listen to your radio show almost every Sunday, but I gotta tell you, you are even more on fire than you were then.
[02:38:34.515 --> 02:38:40.780]  And I know you're smart, you know not to be, you know, too available, because distance makes the heart grow fond.
[02:38:40.800 --> 02:38:50.708]  And I tell you, but it would be great if even once a week you did like an hour podcast or something, or maybe once a month with these thoughts, because let me tell you, this is some really good radio,
[02:38:51.288 --> 02:38:53.209]  Man, I'm enjoying it, and I know the audience is.
[02:38:53.269 --> 02:38:56.451]  I mean, Matt Grudge is kind of co-hosting the Alex Jones Show right now.
[02:38:56.491 --> 02:38:57.171]  This is crazy!
[02:38:58.132 --> 02:38:59.253]  Maybe I'll join Facebook.
[02:39:00.433 --> 02:39:01.334]  Oh yeah, don't do that.
[02:39:02.566 --> 02:39:03.346]  No, I can't.
[02:39:03.726 --> 02:39:08.548]  I realize that just my personality is I've got to stay focused.
[02:39:08.568 --> 02:39:10.268]  I can't be too distracted.
[02:39:10.408 --> 02:39:14.209]  No, your advice to me was right, you know, like a year ago, that don't try to do too much.
[02:39:14.229 --> 02:39:14.850]  I mean, you're right.
[02:39:15.130 --> 02:39:17.850]  Paul Joseph Watson, I told him, watch out for this.
[02:39:18.611 --> 02:39:25.813]  You know, it's a larger topic, but at my height of media availability, I was doing the website
[02:39:26.753 --> 02:39:32.437]  The TV show and the radio show at the same time, as you are doing now, as you are doing now.
[02:39:34.158 --> 02:39:38.820]  Mine was with the corporations, Clear Channel, News Corp, and then the Drudge Report.
[02:39:39.181 --> 02:39:48.927]  But still, I felt just myself, I felt it was just more powerful to go to the web, plus not to necessarily be playing in their playground.
[02:39:49.787 --> 02:39:56.190]  Because the power of the individual, as you represent sitting there right now, is powerful to the heart.
[02:39:56.290 --> 02:40:03.572]  I said to Paul Joseph Watson when I saw him in London, which you just referred to a year ago, you're a romantic figure, Alex, in Americana.
[02:40:03.913 --> 02:40:06.073]  It's romantic what you do here every day.
[02:40:06.294 --> 02:40:06.814]  It just is.
[02:40:07.154 --> 02:40:07.914]  This is romance.
[02:40:08.374 --> 02:40:12.956]  Because you're an American standing up, tough, facing these headwinds.
[02:40:13.516 --> 02:40:14.437]  Wow, are they blowing.
[02:40:14.997 --> 02:40:17.438]  But you're there, and you're not alone.
[02:40:17.878 --> 02:40:23.461]  Limbaugh, Savage, Hannity, Levin, there's a lot of people on the airwaves who are as brave.
[02:40:23.581 --> 02:40:25.582]  They are brave, and they are living it.
[02:40:25.702 --> 02:40:26.263]  I've met them all.
[02:40:26.323 --> 02:40:27.223]  I'm friends with them all.
[02:40:27.963 --> 02:40:28.784]  They are
[02:40:30.788 --> 02:40:36.230]  Also, operating against the grain in an America that needs to go back to that.
[02:40:36.470 --> 02:40:38.350]  Well, the system's tried to put some of them in jail.
[02:40:39.051 --> 02:40:41.371]  I mean, I know a lot of those folks don't talk about the stuff that goes on behind the scenes.
[02:40:41.471 --> 02:40:41.931]  I don't either.
[02:40:41.971 --> 02:40:44.752]  But, you know, these people play hardball.
[02:40:45.132 --> 02:40:47.013]  And some folks can say they're libertarians.
[02:40:47.033 --> 02:40:48.734]  Well, those folks don't sound libertarian enough to me.
[02:40:49.094 --> 02:40:49.734]  It doesn't matter.
[02:40:50.194 --> 02:40:56.236]  The globalists, the Democrats, the collectivists hate anybody who's conservative, anybody who believes in the individual.
[02:40:56.636 --> 02:41:02.105]  And the fact is, those people promote individualism, nationalism, and that's why they've got to be eradicated.
[02:41:02.746 --> 02:41:04.949]  What a horrible world if the system is successful.
[02:41:04.989 --> 02:41:07.854]  Matt Drudge, in your gut, in your heart, do you think...
[02:41:08.737 --> 02:41:11.618]  That humanity is going to be successful and make it the next hundred years.
[02:41:12.159 --> 02:41:13.299]  Oh, the hundred years?
[02:41:13.339 --> 02:41:15.780]  Well, of course, unless Mother Nature decides.
[02:41:16.200 --> 02:41:19.342]  You know, I'm a big fan of letting Mother Nature decide some of this, too.
[02:41:19.862 --> 02:41:21.523]  You know, we can't control a lot of this.
[02:41:22.043 --> 02:41:23.744]  There is a law to the universe.
[02:41:24.264 --> 02:41:24.924]  There just is.
[02:41:25.705 --> 02:41:26.865]  There's just a law to the universe.
[02:41:26.905 --> 02:41:28.826]  We could have the San Andreas ripped tonight.
[02:41:29.406 --> 02:41:30.347]  You had nothing to do with that.
[02:41:31.147 --> 02:41:36.609]  We could have had that super hurricane that, look what they did to South Carolina, two or three hundred miles offshore.
[02:41:36.989 --> 02:41:40.590]  Imagine if a Category 5 eyewall went right up the Chesapeake Bay.
[02:41:41.270 --> 02:41:42.770]  They could say, well, mankind did that.
[02:41:42.850 --> 02:41:44.451]  No, Mother Nature decides.
[02:41:44.491 --> 02:41:45.491]  So will we survive?
[02:41:45.531 --> 02:41:46.211]  I'm sure we will.
[02:41:46.251 --> 02:41:47.172]  What will we be?
[02:41:49.318 --> 02:41:51.059]  Not allowed to speak as we are today?
[02:41:51.499 --> 02:41:54.640]  Well, we'll have it documented that we were allowed to speak that way once.
[02:41:55.421 --> 02:41:57.161]  So, I don't know.
[02:41:57.301 --> 02:41:58.802]  Am I optimistic for myself?
[02:41:58.922 --> 02:41:59.722]  Personally, yes.
[02:41:59.842 --> 02:42:00.463]  I'm strong.
[02:42:00.923 --> 02:42:01.983]  There's not much they can do.
[02:42:02.043 --> 02:42:03.124]  They could laser beam me.
[02:42:03.184 --> 02:42:03.984]  They could drone me.
[02:42:04.044 --> 02:42:05.625]  They can plutonium me.
[02:42:05.685 --> 02:42:06.625]  They could do whatever they wanted.
[02:42:06.645 --> 02:42:08.046]  But spiritually, I'm set.
[02:42:08.706 --> 02:42:09.386]  I've already got it.
[02:42:09.947 --> 02:42:10.968]  So they can't do much.
[02:42:11.448 --> 02:42:17.092]  I just wish there was more media that was trailblazing and independent.
[02:42:17.932 --> 02:42:31.261]  And this to me is a big danger right now in this setup is you've got these corporations like the New York Times and the Amazon now with the Washington Post and Time Warner and all of them seem to be the same.
[02:42:32.455 --> 02:42:33.816]  This is what's frightening.
[02:42:33.836 --> 02:42:36.477]  And there's so much news in the course of the day.
[02:42:36.497 --> 02:42:45.642]  And the reason I think the Drudge Report is interesting every morning is it's not exactly the same as you would see elsewhere.
[02:42:45.862 --> 02:42:48.023]  And that's because I'm not involved with other people.
[02:42:48.783 --> 02:42:51.667]  I'm looking at the world through my eyes, and that's what you're seeing.
[02:42:51.948 --> 02:42:55.072]  With bravery, and with the ability to do it.
[02:42:55.653 --> 02:43:04.566]  Because the ability to do it, what you've created here, with one listener one day, that went to 10 listeners, that went to 50, to now your millions,
[02:43:05.307 --> 02:43:08.810]  Was organically grown, and that's kind of how Earth proceeds.
[02:43:08.890 --> 02:43:10.752]  And it usually takes time, you're absolutely right.
[02:43:11.833 --> 02:43:23.344]  Looking at the open announcements by the Pope for world government, carbon taxes, looking for Obama announcing similar things, they've gone from denying this planetary system is being set up to now admitting it.
[02:43:23.664 --> 02:43:28.329]  We've got all these key meetings, TPP being agreed on just a few days ago.
[02:43:30.178 --> 02:43:33.961]  How is that affecting the people that were brainwashed and told none of this was happening?
[02:43:34.361 --> 02:43:38.624]  How are they going to respond now when all of this starts coming to fruition?
[02:44:00.439 --> 02:44:03.562]  What has happened to this culture that she's now standing as a robot like this?
[02:44:03.822 --> 02:44:10.789]  They are sucking our ability to make an income that is compatible with what you need to.
[02:44:10.849 --> 02:44:13.011]  So I'm getting a little frightened as I travel.
[02:44:13.712 --> 02:44:18.777]  On the other side of it, when I go to New York and I see some of the billionaires, it's the other side.
[02:44:19.277 --> 02:44:19.838]  Endless.
[02:44:20.278 --> 02:44:22.240]  You know, they're fighting over pieces of artwork.
[02:44:23.001 --> 02:44:27.565]  It's gotten to the point where the have-and-they-have-nots here is breaking.
[02:44:28.225 --> 02:44:35.992]  And it's the billionaires that are mainly funding the whole leftist redistribution movement because they end up getting the money in corporate welfare and insider deals.
[02:44:36.052 --> 02:44:36.672]  It's so sick.
[02:44:37.973 --> 02:44:39.014]  I watched a great film.
[02:44:39.034 --> 02:44:43.938]  I don't know if you've seen it yet, but it's The Best of Enemies about Gore Vidal and William F. Buckley.
[02:44:43.958 --> 02:44:44.559]  Have you seen that yet?
[02:44:44.619 --> 02:44:44.779]  No.
[02:44:44.979 --> 02:44:45.600]  You've got to see it.
[02:44:47.441 --> 02:44:54.607]  It shows Gore Vidal arguing, saying the answer is- And by the way, why are we not allowed to have a Gore Vidal, William Buckley anymore in the media scene?
[02:44:54.627 --> 02:44:55.628]  Do you see who they hire?
[02:44:56.189 --> 02:44:58.290]  Do you see who's hired for the shows?
[02:44:58.591 --> 02:44:59.491]  How dull they are?
[02:44:59.552 --> 02:44:59.752]  Yes.
[02:45:00.312 --> 02:45:00.733]  Dull!
[02:45:01.133 --> 02:45:01.874]  Dull as dishwater.
[02:45:01.894 --> 02:45:04.035]  They want you to tune out of politics and into entertainment.
[02:45:04.055 --> 02:45:07.578]  Yes, they make- Where are the flamboyant characters?
[02:45:07.799 --> 02:45:10.161]  This is what America desperately needs right now.
[02:45:10.241 --> 02:45:14.725]  Flamboyant, intellectual characters who can cut different ways.
[02:45:15.665 --> 02:45:16.566]  And that's just what I'm missing.
[02:45:16.906 --> 02:45:21.609]  I've been fortunate enough to meet some of the greats of this generation, and I've got to tell you, they are there.
[02:45:22.269 --> 02:45:29.033]  It's just they are suppressed and hidden, and they're not hired the way Gore Vidal and Buckley were back a previous generation.
[02:45:29.073 --> 02:45:30.454]  They were not afraid of ideas.
[02:45:30.954 --> 02:45:35.057]  This generation is frightened of ideas, or at least it's being suppressed.
[02:45:35.891 --> 02:45:37.513]  Let's throw in the few minutes we have left.
[02:45:37.533 --> 02:45:40.297]  We're about to go to break and I know you've given us more time than you even said you would.
[02:45:40.357 --> 02:45:46.946]  Matt Drudge is our guest, DrudgeReport.com, obviously in studio here in Austin, Texas, visiting a surprise visit, one of the best ever.
[02:45:46.966 --> 02:45:48.849]  That's better than the surprise birthday parties I've had.
[02:45:50.438 --> 02:45:51.118]  Fifteen years.
[02:45:51.258 --> 02:46:02.024]  I don't think that it's Putin's this great angel or this wonderful, perfect person, but our foreign policy is so corrupt, so deceptive, it makes him look good, and nobody's going to back Al-Qaeda.
[02:46:02.044 --> 02:46:19.153]  I talked about this last Thursday and Friday, and I'll find the article and we'll put it in this video later and put it out as a report, but it was Reuters reporting that the White House is angry that these airstrikes by the Russians have hit the moderates, al-Nusra, which is Al-Qaeda in Syria.
[02:46:20.200 --> 02:46:25.102]  And then it just went on, and they're telling him to stop doing it, and he didn't hit ISIS.
[02:46:25.922 --> 02:46:29.343]  But then Putin pointed out, no, that's the bosses of ISIS, that's just their fighters.
[02:46:29.583 --> 02:46:30.824]  It's the same group, which is true.
[02:46:31.144 --> 02:46:32.364]  But it's Twilight Zone.
[02:46:32.584 --> 02:46:37.486]  I can't even believe I'm reading Reuters, who has writers with a straight face,
[02:46:38.146 --> 02:46:46.729]  That we'll just sit there and write articles about how Al-Qaeda is moderate and not bad, and then we criticize Russia for bombing them when they're attacking Russian interests.
[02:46:47.190 --> 02:46:48.770]  It's just so bizarre.
[02:46:49.270 --> 02:46:52.912]  It seems like that Karl Rove quote where he said, we control reality.
[02:46:53.272 --> 02:46:55.833]  I don't think Obama and these guys really control reality.
[02:46:56.093 --> 02:47:01.275]  And now we've got John McCain saying, let's go ahead and end Zbigniew Brzezinski and have war with Russia.
[02:47:01.615 --> 02:47:03.696]  Let's go ahead and attack the Russian aircraft.
[02:47:04.016 --> 02:47:05.477]  I mean, it's crazy town.
[02:47:05.497 --> 02:47:06.137]  What do you say to that?
[02:47:06.237 --> 02:47:07.338]  Well, I'll say this.
[02:47:07.398 --> 02:47:10.479]  We never even heard of ISIS until recently.
[02:47:10.519 --> 02:47:12.500]  And I remember when that name first started coming up.
[02:47:12.540 --> 02:47:15.922]  Do you know it was designed to be confused with Daryl Issa?
[02:47:15.942 --> 02:47:16.963]  No, I didn't know that.
[02:47:17.003 --> 02:47:18.003]  Do you know that's what it was?
[02:47:18.423 --> 02:47:21.765]  Because Daryl Issa was the enemy at the time of this administration.
[02:47:21.785 --> 02:47:24.246]  You know, there would have been a time Obama could have been impeached.
[02:47:24.586 --> 02:47:26.567]  And I'm thinking of the IRS scandal, most likely.
[02:47:26.587 --> 02:47:27.268]  That would have been the one.
[02:47:28.032 --> 02:47:35.194]  You get the depositions going, you get the president under oath, you follow the chain, Obama most likely would have been impeached.
[02:47:35.654 --> 02:47:39.556]  Boehner decided, we're not going there, we're not going to have those cities burn.
[02:47:40.116 --> 02:47:42.437]  We're not going to do it, we're not going to impeach Obama.
[02:47:43.337 --> 02:47:46.758]  So I felt Daryl Issa, that's his name, right?
[02:47:46.778 --> 02:47:49.779]  Because I'm getting all Issa, Issa, Daryl Issa.
[02:47:51.113 --> 02:47:56.639]  I think they came up with the name ISIS to be confused with their own ISA.
[02:47:56.739 --> 02:47:58.140]  I'm really being honest with you.
[02:47:58.460 --> 02:48:03.325]  I remember when the first time Christiane Amanpour sputtered out this word ISIS.
[02:48:04.326 --> 02:48:05.767]  Where did she get that one?
[02:48:06.508 --> 02:48:08.290]  You know, these words are creative.
[02:48:08.550 --> 02:48:09.611]  These events are creative.
[02:48:09.631 --> 02:48:12.394]  Now we act like, oh, ISIS has been around for 20, 30 years.
[02:48:12.734 --> 02:48:13.255]  Says who?
[02:48:13.335 --> 02:48:14.316]  It's been around a year and a half.
[02:48:14.596 --> 02:48:14.816]  Yeah.
[02:48:15.096 --> 02:48:16.838]  Designed to confuse.
[02:48:17.258 --> 02:48:21.763]  And then the president going, it's not even ISIS, it's ISIL, or ICE.
[02:48:21.923 --> 02:48:22.403]  Or ISIL.
[02:48:22.824 --> 02:48:23.364]  Or IS.
[02:48:24.400 --> 02:48:25.501]  This is Dr. Seuss!
[02:48:25.981 --> 02:48:26.822]  This is madness!
[02:48:26.942 --> 02:48:32.727]  I'm glad you're able to follow any of it, because when I sit down and look at the news, I'm not able to follow the bouncing ball.
[02:48:33.047 --> 02:48:33.848]  Is Putin here?
[02:48:33.928 --> 02:48:34.748]  Is Obama here?
[02:48:35.089 --> 02:48:36.050]  Where does this one go?
[02:48:36.070 --> 02:48:37.391]  I can't follow.
[02:48:37.451 --> 02:48:38.632]  Can you put the pieces together?
[02:48:38.652 --> 02:48:39.973]  I'm glad you can, because I can't.
[02:48:41.417 --> 02:48:41.677]  Wow.
[02:48:41.837 --> 02:48:45.819]  Well, we're going to break here in about a minute and a half, and then I'm going to come back and play a special report.
[02:48:45.839 --> 02:48:48.760]  They're going to go into the fourth hour, being hosted by one of our co-hosts today.
[02:48:48.800 --> 02:48:52.021]  But, Matt, in the two minutes we've got left, it's amazing to have you here.
[02:48:52.341 --> 02:48:54.442]  What else do you think is front and center in the universe?
[02:48:54.822 --> 02:49:05.427]  In the last two minutes here, what do you want to say to the audience and to the dinosaur media that is going to gleefully try to edit this and chop this up and, I guess, use it for their funeral pyre?
[02:49:06.207 --> 02:49:07.127]  Well, they're welcome to.
[02:49:07.167 --> 02:49:09.288]  Again, they've got no control over the situation.
[02:49:09.488 --> 02:49:09.728]  None.
[02:49:10.289 --> 02:49:10.829]  No control.
[02:49:11.089 --> 02:49:11.989]  No control over me.
[02:49:12.029 --> 02:49:12.429]  Sorry.
[02:49:12.850 --> 02:49:13.290]  Zero.
[02:49:14.210 --> 02:49:16.031]  I wanted to congratulate you.
[02:49:16.451 --> 02:49:17.651]  People don't really talk about this.
[02:49:17.671 --> 02:49:20.353]  You were one of the first to stream 24 hours a day.
[02:49:21.413 --> 02:49:26.135]  And I think the reason I was drawn into InfoWars was because of this streaming.
[02:49:27.069 --> 02:49:39.492]  Uh, this is a profound break that you did to allow the audience to hear you at any time, to make it available at any time, from anywhere, looping, looping, looping, until the next broadcast.
[02:49:40.092 --> 02:49:41.493]  This is a profound thing you did.
[02:49:41.553 --> 02:49:43.593]  I don't think that's recognized enough in the industry.
[02:49:43.613 --> 02:49:45.194]  I'm just talking shop talk here for a second.
[02:49:46.934 --> 02:49:55.237]  That was big, because what you're seeing with the AM dial now, and I'm not besmirching any stations that are carrying this right now, but some of these ratings are frightening.
[02:49:55.617 --> 02:49:57.978]  Some of these ratings in these major cities are frightening.
[02:49:58.018 --> 02:50:03.840]  I'm talking about half the listeners, generally overall, for every talk host.
[02:50:03.980 --> 02:50:07.281]  Some of them are down a half, a half in one year.
[02:50:08.121 --> 02:50:14.365]  Something is going on, but you broke through with this 24-hour looping, always available.
[02:50:14.385 --> 02:50:19.628]  On my happiest nights, I'm sitting here and I'm listening to you from wherever I am in the world.
[02:50:20.448 --> 02:50:20.848]  Looping.
[02:50:21.589 --> 02:50:22.829]  Getting it, getting it, getting it.
[02:50:22.909 --> 02:50:23.510]  And the guests.
[02:50:24.209 --> 02:50:25.370]  This is a profound shift.
[02:50:25.770 --> 02:50:27.612]  Available anytime, from anywhere.
[02:50:27.792 --> 02:50:28.833]  That was you, Alex.
[02:50:28.873 --> 02:50:29.374]  That was a big one.
[02:50:29.394 --> 02:50:30.495]  That was like 12 years ago.
[02:50:30.515 --> 02:50:38.582]  I said, why don't we just send the stream out once, and then wait for a podcast to come up before they even called it podcast, which is an MP3.
[02:50:38.602 --> 02:50:40.083]  So organically again.
[02:50:40.483 --> 02:50:44.987]  Yet again, another organically grown decision that changed the media landscape.
[02:50:45.007 --> 02:50:47.670]  Well sure, and I said, why not just have, I don't want to just have
[02:50:47.950 --> 02:50:54.572]  Because I was one of the first, people were doing this 20 years ago, Limbaugh was probably the first, with a little, you know, pod cam, took a photo every minute or something.
[02:50:54.992 --> 02:51:03.395]  I said, why don't we just put cameras in here so I can show people articles, show them photos, show them books, and even show them video clips, and then we'll start streaming it.
[02:51:03.935 --> 02:51:07.976]  And by the way, Limbaugh was genius for doing that because he bypassed broadcast.
[02:51:08.296 --> 02:51:12.077]  He didn't have to hook up with a Fox or CNN to show him in real time.
[02:51:12.117 --> 02:51:13.238]  He was able to bypass that.
[02:51:13.478 --> 02:51:16.279]  And I think there was some cams for radio shows before that.
[02:51:16.299 --> 02:51:16.419]  Sure.
[02:51:17.999 --> 02:51:23.522]  But what you did by breaking the mold, by breaking the mold, whatever you said that day, like, why don't we loop it?
[02:51:24.383 --> 02:51:26.023]  I can't tell you how that's changed.
[02:51:26.364 --> 02:51:38.810]  I would say the majority of your listeners are, have, and will discover you through the looping and the broadcast, because now we can drive around and listen to you without the streaming, even though it seems like the streaming is where things are going.
[02:51:39.490 --> 02:51:42.072]  I gotta say, when you broke the egg there,
[02:51:42.861 --> 02:51:45.023]  When you cracked the egg, that was a big one.
[02:51:45.043 --> 02:51:47.584]  That was a Stanley Kubrick moment of the bone going up.
[02:51:48.185 --> 02:51:49.106]  What you did with that one.
[02:51:49.146 --> 02:52:04.617]  So that was... Well, I don't think it's as big as the bones you've been throwing up that turned into the spaceships, but I tell you, it's amazing to just have the diverse audience that tunes in to hear me babble, speak of the devil, like people like Stanley Kubrick's daughter and folks that have popped up too, and you're like, you check it out, and this is really Stanley Kubrick's daughter that helped make some of his films.
[02:52:05.077 --> 02:52:05.758]  It just blows your mind.
[02:52:05.778 --> 02:52:08.019]  Oh, and by the way, if Stanley Kubrick was alive, can you imagine?
[02:52:08.540 --> 02:52:09.801]  Can you imagine where he would have gone?
[02:52:10.481 --> 02:52:11.543]  He would have done some great work.
[02:52:11.663 --> 02:52:11.783]  Oh.
[02:52:12.023 --> 02:52:13.846]  We're missing the Hollywood push too.
[02:52:14.187 --> 02:52:15.709]  Where's the greatness coming out of Hollywood?
[02:52:15.729 --> 02:52:16.490]  They want it dumbed down.
[02:52:16.530 --> 02:52:17.632]  I've talked to top Hollywood people.
[02:52:17.672 --> 02:52:18.814]  Enough of the Martian crap.
[02:52:19.234 --> 02:52:19.855]  Tell us something.
[02:52:20.055 --> 02:52:22.459]  Tell us something big and real and profound as Kubrick would have.
[02:52:22.539 --> 02:52:23.240]  On a human level.
[02:52:23.541 --> 02:52:24.121]  On a human level.
[02:52:24.946 --> 02:52:31.171]  Well, I'm not allowed to say what I was told about Kubrick, but let me say, it was obvious from his films, he would be on board with us.
[02:52:31.271 --> 02:52:34.133]  You know, Spielberg keeps going back to World War II.
[02:52:34.553 --> 02:52:35.514]  I mean, enough already.
[02:52:36.975 --> 02:52:37.795]  Let's get focused.
[02:52:37.876 --> 02:52:38.676]  I look at a P.T.
[02:52:38.756 --> 02:52:42.439]  Anderson, and I don't know, it's kind of gone into a marijuana cloud for me.
[02:52:42.879 --> 02:52:46.302]  Where are the artists who are challenging this generation like Kubrick did?
[02:52:46.402 --> 02:52:47.923]  So, that's another topic separately.
[02:52:48.183 --> 02:52:49.484]  Well, we're going to break in one minute.
[02:52:49.504 --> 02:52:52.847]  We're going to hear John Bowne's report, come back, and who's hosting the fourth hour today?
[02:52:54.850 --> 02:53:04.337]  Thunderstruck that David Knight's got a bunch coming up, and obviously we need to get clips of this epic interview, play those, and put those out on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:53:04.818 --> 02:53:13.104]  Matt, how fast do you think, here's what's crazy, five years ago I cared if mainstream media wrote stories against us, or I cared if I was on Nightline or something, you've been in more big stuff than I have.
[02:53:13.484 --> 02:53:16.026]  Now it doesn't even do anything when I'm on those shows.
[02:53:16.367 --> 02:53:21.170]  That's why I know that they don't mean anything, and so we should end with this, you were the guy
[02:53:22.091 --> 02:53:30.180]  Who tweeted, at least from what I saw, at Piers Morgan three years ago, or two and a half years ago, to say, have Alex Jones on, debate him.
[02:53:30.200 --> 02:53:34.865]  Matchmaker, yeah, behind the scenes, people don't know this about me, I'm a matchmaker behind the scenes.
[02:53:35.326 --> 02:53:39.811]  That I've had the ability to make some deals happen and do some things behind the scenes.
[02:53:39.851 --> 02:53:43.495]  Now, I've never met Piers Morgan, but I do believe that tweet that day did lead to that.
[02:53:43.775 --> 02:53:52.939]  Well, no, they told me in his office, they said, what do you think of Matt Drudge's idea, because they got my cell phone number and called me because CNN had it, and I said... Which ended up being the most dramatic moment on CNN in a generation.
[02:53:52.959 --> 02:53:54.179]  They admit that.
[02:53:54.240 --> 02:53:55.540]  They have votes and say that.
[02:53:55.580 --> 02:53:59.722]  That's why they need to hire people away from 6th Avenue just to look at the scene.
[02:53:59.742 --> 02:54:03.604]  I remember once saying to Charlie Rose, why aren't you having more conservatives on?
[02:54:03.664 --> 02:54:04.464]  And he says, who?
[02:54:05.104 --> 02:54:06.585]  And, you know, there's a whole list of them.
[02:54:07.290 --> 02:54:08.871]  Why are they limiting themselves?
[02:54:08.931 --> 02:54:12.754]  Because you would say it's a contrived plan to limit.
[02:54:13.494 --> 02:54:20.920]  But I still think to make provocative programming, you've got to have different points of view, a la the Buckley and Gore Vidal.
[02:54:21.760 --> 02:54:23.522]  Where is that in this culture?
[02:54:24.042 --> 02:54:24.582]  It's missing.
[02:54:24.722 --> 02:54:25.863]  I get it from InfoWars.
[02:54:26.484 --> 02:54:28.725]  I get it from other places too, mainly talk radio.
[02:54:28.765 --> 02:54:33.048]  Talk radio seems to be the driving force of this culture, at least in spoken word.
[02:54:33.769 --> 02:54:35.730]  I'm not getting it from television that much.
[02:54:35.810 --> 02:54:36.451]  I'm just not.
[02:54:37.211 --> 02:54:39.153]  Where are the intriguing television shows?
[02:54:39.433 --> 02:54:42.095]  I mean, you could say Homeland, you can say some of these others.
[02:54:42.676 --> 02:54:43.576]  Okay, yes.
[02:54:44.197 --> 02:54:46.599]  But where are the real dynamic things that are pushing?
[02:54:46.639 --> 02:54:47.720]  Let's expand on that.
[02:54:48.320 --> 02:54:52.764]  Piers Morgan had a ratings boost for about 30-40% for two weeks after that.
[02:54:53.064 --> 02:54:55.727]  Then it went down, steadily declined, and they got rid of him.
[02:54:56.367 --> 02:54:58.068]  CNN knows that if they
[02:54:58.849 --> 02:55:00.790]  Well, it all depends if the sick Americans get un-sick.
[02:55:00.890 --> 02:55:01.510]  That's all.
[02:55:01.530 --> 02:55:03.912]  That's all you just have to do because if you get well, if you get well,
[02:55:22.503 --> 02:55:25.406]  You're not that interested in what Anderson Cooper is saying about things.
[02:55:25.526 --> 02:55:26.547]  You're just not, I'm sorry.
[02:55:26.567 --> 02:55:27.788]  I don't mean to be insulting.
[02:55:28.308 --> 02:55:31.131]  If you're sick, you find comfort in that.
[02:55:32.292 --> 02:55:33.373]  What are your final words?
[02:55:33.893 --> 02:55:35.175]  What do you mean final words?
[02:55:35.975 --> 02:55:37.737]  These are the last words ever spoken on earth?
[02:55:37.937 --> 02:55:38.998]  These are the final words?
[02:55:39.018 --> 02:55:40.800]  Yes, George Washington says tis well.
[02:55:41.961 --> 02:55:46.763]  Well, again, I just wanted to come to congratulate you from building organically from the ground up.
[02:55:46.783 --> 02:55:48.223]  Thank you.
[02:55:48.403 --> 02:55:51.004]  A media that is not only American, it's just Western.
[02:55:51.164 --> 02:55:52.665]  It's not even Western, it's just freedom.
[02:55:53.125 --> 02:55:59.647]  I can imagine somebody right now listening to us who's sitting in a prison cell somewhere, somewhere awful, thinking about freedom.
[02:56:00.328 --> 02:56:01.948]  So congratulations to you.
[02:56:01.968 --> 02:56:02.949]  I have more power to you.
[02:56:03.009 --> 02:56:03.829]  Take care of yourself.
[02:56:04.591 --> 02:56:06.372]  Because, you know, you're the vehicle, too.
[02:56:06.592 --> 02:56:08.172]  Well, I'm speechless, Matt Drudge.
[02:56:08.532 --> 02:56:09.433]  I can't go on.
[02:56:09.473 --> 02:56:10.453]  Sorry to the callers.
[02:56:10.513 --> 02:56:11.314]  David Knight's coming up.
[02:56:11.614 --> 02:56:13.294]  I'll be back tomorrow, Lord willing, 11 a.m.
[02:56:13.314 --> 02:56:13.774]  to 2 p.m.
[02:56:13.794 --> 02:56:14.155]  Central.
[02:56:14.535 --> 02:56:18.156]  A fourth hour coming up as we move into the Overdrive Show and Nightly News tonight at 7.
[02:56:19.356 --> 02:56:23.238]  But we're going to go ahead and go to this John Bowne report and then come back with the fourth hour.
[02:56:23.598 --> 02:56:25.699]  Infowars.com forward slash show to find all that.
[02:56:25.999 --> 02:56:27.159]  Matt Drudge is here in studio.
[02:56:27.199 --> 02:56:28.400]  I'm going to give him the tour now.
[02:56:28.600 --> 02:56:29.080]  Thank you, Matt.
[02:56:29.100 --> 02:56:30.421]  That was an amazing 45 minutes.
[02:56:30.701 --> 02:56:31.301]  Here's the report.
[02:56:33.086 --> 02:56:39.131]  There's been another mass shooting in America, this time in a community college in Oregon.
[02:56:41.593 --> 02:56:49.900]  That means there are more American families, moms, dads, children, whose lives have been changed forever.
[02:56:52.122 --> 02:56:54.264]  That means there's another community stunned with grief.
[02:56:55.539 --> 02:56:59.562]  And communities across the country forced to relieve their own anguish.
[02:57:00.503 --> 02:57:10.410]  And parents across the country who are scared because they know it might have been their families or their children.
[02:57:11.971 --> 02:57:20.117]  We talked about this after Columbine and Blacksburg, after Tucson, after Newtown, after Aurora, after Charleston.
[02:57:20.998 --> 02:57:23.980]  It cannot be this easy for somebody who wants to inflict
[02:57:25.296 --> 02:57:28.279]  Harm on other people to get his or her hands on a gun.
[02:57:29.240 --> 02:57:30.581]  More families victimized.
[02:57:30.842 --> 02:57:43.094]  More average citizens President Obama may or may not personally offer his condolences to because he is too busy pleading his case to eliminate our constitutional Second Amendment right to protect ourselves and our communities.
[02:57:43.354 --> 02:57:55.119]  Pew Research's July 2014 poll, The Demographics and Politics of Gun Owning Households, found that about 6 in 10 gun household members, 64%, say they often feel proud to be an American.
[02:57:55.379 --> 02:57:59.461]  In contrast, about half, 51%, of other adults say this.
[02:57:59.981 --> 02:58:05.223]  There exists a constitutional mindset and reason for owning a weapon in the United States.
[02:58:05.523 --> 02:58:27.597]  The United States ranks numero uno in gun ownership, dominating at 88.8% per 100 residents, according to 2014 numbers from the Small Arms Survey based in Geneva, Switzerland, a group staffed by experts in security studies, political science, law, international public policy, developmental studies, economics, conflict resolution, and sociology.
[02:58:27.877 --> 02:58:32.780]  These are the people pushing the international policies to agendize constitutional freedoms
[02:58:33.240 --> 02:58:37.223]  We as a nation require an order for our republic to operate.
[02:58:37.463 --> 02:58:40.226]  And the media spin on the coverage is always the same.
[02:58:40.346 --> 02:58:42.367]  Who cares who the shooter was in Oregon?
[02:58:42.627 --> 02:58:43.308]  Why should we?
[02:58:43.608 --> 02:58:53.116]  Our immediate and only reality-based concerns should be for the families and communities that need to be protected by the next incident, whether it's three months or three years from now.
[02:58:53.476 --> 02:58:55.918]  If we could just all pay attention to the numbers.
[02:58:58.729 --> 02:59:00.091]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[02:59:00.371 --> 02:59:01.652]  You can't survive without it.
[02:59:01.852 --> 02:59:02.753]  But where do you get it?
[02:59:03.054 --> 02:59:08.840]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new, groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.
[02:59:09.060 --> 02:59:14.786]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.
[02:59:14.966 --> 02:59:31.819]  Pairing the unprecedented superfiltration power of an all-new Gravity Block Core with a hybrid chromatic shell, it removes up to 99.999% of impurities, including bacteria, viruses, fluoride, disinfectants, volatile organic contaminants, and hormones.
[02:59:32.199 --> 02:59:34.340]  Filter capacity up to 5,000 gallons.
[02:59:34.701 --> 02:59:35.901]  Stainless steel construction.
[02:59:36.162 --> 02:59:36.942]  Easy assembly.
[02:59:37.202 --> 02:59:37.843]  Low maintenance.
[02:59:38.123 --> 02:59:39.944]  Replacement filters are simple to install.

[03:00:01.138 --> 03:00:05.339]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:11.321 --> 03:00:17.342]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:00:17.962 --> 03:00:20.943]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:25.273 --> 03:00:31.419]  Welcome back to the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Radio Show on Remember Remember, the 5th of November.
[03:00:31.459 --> 03:00:35.503]  Yes, today is November 5th, 2015, Guy Fawkes Day in the UK.
[03:00:36.044 --> 03:00:39.487]  There's going to be a Million Mask March today around the world.
[03:00:39.527 --> 03:00:40.789]  We'll see what happens with that.
[03:00:40.809 --> 03:00:42.250]  There's a live blog of that on RT.
[03:00:43.251 --> 03:00:47.034]  I'll be talking about that to Jakari Jackson later in the show.
[03:00:47.074 --> 03:00:48.576]  He'll be joining me at the bottom of the hour.
[03:00:48.596 --> 03:01:03.608]  Some of the things we'll be talking about with him, once he gets on here, we're going to be talking about Disney using a film to tell us that, and of course this is a documentary, this is the way this is coming out, this is Abigail Disney, and they're putting this documentary out.
[03:01:04.409 --> 03:01:09.531]  And telling gun owners that owning a gun is incompatible with being a Christian.
[03:01:09.551 --> 03:01:11.551]  You can't be pro-life and own a gun.
[03:01:12.031 --> 03:01:15.772]  So we'll be talking about that as well as what happened after the election.
[03:01:15.832 --> 03:01:20.634]  Did Bloomberg's campaign to shut down guns, he spent a lot of money.
[03:01:21.034 --> 03:01:22.414]  What kind of results did he get?
[03:01:22.474 --> 03:01:23.735]  We're going to have that for you as well.
[03:01:24.155 --> 03:01:30.666]  There's also a story that we'll be covering in the miscellaneous information about a Virginia toll road, a major legal setback.
[03:01:30.806 --> 03:01:36.115]  They have been fining people up to $1,000 for each unpaid toll.
[03:01:36.355 --> 03:01:37.317]  That's just the fine portion.
[03:01:38.294 --> 03:01:41.817]  And of course, this is something that was snuck in by a corporation.
[03:01:42.317 --> 03:01:48.883]  Oh, speaking of corporations sneaking in stuff, today we had the release of the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
[03:01:49.603 --> 03:01:51.065]  It surfaced first in New Zealand.
[03:01:51.105 --> 03:01:54.507]  I guess all the governments involved decided that they were going to release it on the 5th of November.
[03:01:54.908 --> 03:01:56.609]  Why not put it out on Guy Fawkes Day?
[03:01:56.629 --> 03:01:58.411]  It's one way to get back at the population, right?
[03:01:59.450 --> 03:02:04.962]  Uh, they released it today, and of course, New Zealand being where the day begins, they got their text up first.
[03:02:05.002 --> 03:02:07.127]  We're going to talk about what has been revealed about it.
[03:02:07.287 --> 03:02:07.869]  Basically...
[03:02:08.993 --> 03:02:13.454]  All we see is the media still spinning this, still controlling this.
[03:02:13.614 --> 03:02:14.675]  Ah, there's that graphic there.
[03:02:14.695 --> 03:02:15.415]  Isn't that interesting?
[03:02:15.455 --> 03:02:19.996]  If you're looking at this, that's the White House talking about the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
[03:02:20.016 --> 03:02:23.957]  And they've got this little logo that they've created that looks very much like Obama's logo.
[03:02:24.557 --> 03:02:26.998]  PPP, and underneath it, Made in America.
[03:02:27.018 --> 03:02:33.160]  And of course, we need to strike out that Made in America and put above it Made in Secret.
[03:02:34.841 --> 03:02:39.342]  This wasn't created by the American government, in spite of what Obama and the White House want to tell us.
[03:02:40.162 --> 03:02:44.663]  He says that we, with TPP, we're writing the rules of the road for the 21st century.
[03:02:44.703 --> 03:02:46.303]  That's absolute baloney!
[03:02:46.903 --> 03:02:48.384]  America didn't write those rules.
[03:02:48.624 --> 03:02:50.724]  America couldn't even see those rules.
[03:02:50.804 --> 03:02:52.725]  Our elected representatives could not even see it.
[03:02:52.765 --> 03:02:54.765]  They were not a part of the process.
[03:02:55.565 --> 03:02:57.606]  It was being done by corporate lobbyists.
[03:02:57.626 --> 03:02:58.126]  There you go.
[03:02:58.246 --> 03:02:59.686]  Made in secret.
[03:03:00.026 --> 03:03:02.347]  That's really what is behind this whole thing.
[03:03:02.367 --> 03:03:03.347]  I think it's very interesting.
[03:03:04.318 --> 03:03:09.523]  Part of this massive slick propaganda stuff that we're seeing from
[03:03:11.095 --> 03:03:15.657]  Obama, we've seen that from him ever since he went in, and we're going to talk about what's going on with this.
[03:03:15.697 --> 03:03:18.939]  Of course, there's three mechanisms that they're moving us to world government very rapidly.
[03:03:19.560 --> 03:03:21.100]  One of those is the trade treaties.
[03:03:21.581 --> 03:03:29.305]  Another one is climate change, and that's going to be a treaty that's going to be coming up in December, probably about the same time this will come to a vote.
[03:03:29.325 --> 03:03:32.987]  A lot of people are saying they didn't expect this to happen until after the beginning of the year.
[03:03:33.047 --> 03:03:36.809]  I'm going to tell you why I think it's going to happen around the holidays.
[03:03:37.449 --> 03:03:45.411]  I've always thought that's going to be the case, and certainly, according to the Trade Promotion Authority, they could do that within 30 days.
[03:03:45.451 --> 03:03:46.991]  I'm going to read you the documents from that.
[03:03:47.531 --> 03:04:01.974]  But when we look at the mechanisms that they're using right now to create global governance, there's the trade treaties that unify us politically and economically, just like the European Union, as Senator Sessions, one of the few people who bothered to read this agreement, pointed out and warned us about.
[03:04:02.694 --> 03:04:08.321]  And of course, that's also going to create a new government organization that is transnational.
[03:04:08.381 --> 03:04:11.265]  But they have to take down the existing national governments.
[03:04:11.305 --> 03:04:19.314]  And the way that they're going to do that is with open borders, with multiculturalism, with what we see going on in Europe, what is happening in America as well.
[03:04:20.225 --> 03:04:24.509]  So, the third leg of that is going to be climate change agreements.
[03:04:24.529 --> 03:04:26.491]  So we've got the treaty, we've got climate change.
[03:04:26.551 --> 03:04:28.873]  Both of those will give us global structures.
[03:04:28.893 --> 03:04:31.876]  They'll give us a taxing mechanism in the case of climate change.
[03:04:31.916 --> 03:04:35.079]  They'll give us a bureaucracy, a regulatory mechanism.
[03:04:35.099 --> 03:04:36.640]  You have to have that for global governance.
[03:04:36.960 --> 03:04:42.485]  They'll also give us some kind of a planetary council that will enforce this agreement.
[03:04:43.146 --> 03:04:45.388]  But of course, we're also going to have a political and economic union.
[03:04:45.428 --> 03:04:53.376]  We're also going to have a governance body that can write these rules independent of whatever it says.
[03:04:53.396 --> 03:04:54.897]  Do we have 2,000 pages?
[03:04:55.438 --> 03:04:55.758]  6,000 pages?
[03:04:55.818 --> 03:04:58.321]  It really doesn't matter because they can change it as well.
[03:04:58.741 --> 03:04:59.502]  We'll be right back.
[03:04:59.522 --> 03:05:03.005]  We're going to talk to you about details that we've seen of the TPP.
[03:05:03.045 --> 03:05:03.466]  Stay with us.
[03:05:08.863 --> 03:05:11.604]  You're racist if you attack Planned Parenthood.
[03:05:11.765 --> 03:05:14.386]  That's according to feminist icon Gloria Steinem.
[03:05:14.726 --> 03:05:26.452]  Steinem claims the current backlash against Planned Parenthood is part of an ultra-right-wing attempt to restore the basis of patriarchy, a long-term racist system which is controlling reproduction.
[03:05:26.812 --> 03:05:30.393]  And to control reproduction, you have to control the bodies of women.
[03:05:30.753 --> 03:05:34.915]  What kind of inverted reality is this CIA-connected activist living in?
[03:05:35.175 --> 03:05:42.337]  Contrary to all those social justice buzzwords, Planned Parenthood was founded by a self-described racist.
[03:05:42.437 --> 03:05:51.040]  Founder Margaret Sanger famously said in 1939, We don't want the word to go out that we want to exterminate the Negro population.
[03:05:51.380 --> 03:05:57.805]  Planned Parenthood was founded to control the bodies of black women in order to control the black population.
[03:05:58.186 --> 03:06:03.290]  If you can wade through all of Steinem's doublespeak, you might just figure out who the real racists are.

[03:06:46.768 --> 03:06:49.912]  There's always hidden additives in your food, even organic food has hidden additives.

[03:06:53.537 --> 03:06:55.300]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.

[03:06:56.421 --> 03:06:57.361]  It doesn't have garbage in it.

[03:08:10.595 --> 03:08:12.818]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[03:08:12.838 --> 03:08:16.262]  Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:20.567 --> 03:08:23.291]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show, the 5th of November, 2015.
[03:08:24.172 --> 03:08:25.594]  I'm David Knight, your host.
[03:08:26.309 --> 03:08:28.631]  Jagara Jackson will be joining me at the bottom of the hour.
[03:08:28.691 --> 03:08:30.513]  We're going to talk about Piers Morgan.
[03:08:30.593 --> 03:08:33.816]  He's back in the news, telling us how to conduct our foreign policy this time.
[03:08:33.856 --> 03:08:39.000]  He says, ISIS is going to nuke America, so we've got to invade the Middle East.
[03:08:39.080 --> 03:08:40.962]  Well, you know, I would suggest this to Piers.
[03:08:41.082 --> 03:08:44.125]  He had figured out how to stop gun violence in America.
[03:08:44.165 --> 03:08:46.147]  You just, simply, you just pass a law.
[03:08:46.807 --> 03:08:49.069]  And gun violence stops instantly.
[03:08:49.209 --> 03:09:06.722]  So I would suggest that we pass a law, instead of invading the Middle East, just pass a law saying that we're going to, it's illegal to conduct nuclear terror in the United States or to put bombs on planes and then we can disband the TSA and we can do all those things because everybody will listen to the law, right?
[03:09:07.182 --> 03:09:08.584]  Same way they do with guns.
[03:09:09.344 --> 03:09:15.275]  Also, we're going to play the clip from Bill Maher saying that InfoWars is a website that real Americans read.
[03:09:15.595 --> 03:09:20.363]  He did it as a dig to us, and of course it was a cleverly done...
[03:09:21.627 --> 03:09:29.909]  Way to associate nonsense with InfoWars, but I think we ought to take that and use that as our subtitle.
[03:09:30.529 --> 03:09:32.490]  The website that real Americans read.
[03:09:33.250 --> 03:09:33.890]  InfoWars.
[03:09:33.950 --> 03:09:34.531]  I'll take that.
[03:09:35.471 --> 03:09:40.032]  We're going to be talking about a toll scandal that's going on in Virginia.
[03:09:40.412 --> 03:09:43.933]  Up to $1,000 fines if you don't pay a toll.
[03:09:44.333 --> 03:09:46.954]  And that's, of course, a private corporation.
[03:09:47.634 --> 03:09:50.656]  Because most of these toll roads are owned by private corporations.
[03:09:50.696 --> 03:09:53.478]  The one in Virginia is owned by an Australian corporation, I believe.
[03:09:54.218 --> 03:10:00.642]  And the ones in Texas, most of the ones here in Texas are owned by a Spanish corporation that pushes these things through.
[03:10:01.162 --> 03:10:04.484]  Very much like what we're seeing with the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
[03:10:04.525 --> 03:10:06.966]  I'm going to give you the details that we've seen so far with this.
[03:10:07.026 --> 03:10:13.030]  It's going to take us some time to analyze this because it is literally several thousand pages long.
[03:10:14.124 --> 03:10:21.991]  But we're going to look at the timing, we're going to look at the reaction of the media, of some politicians to it, and I'm going to give you my thoughts on when I think this is going to come through.
[03:10:22.511 --> 03:10:24.973]  We also have some more news about Jeb.
[03:10:24.993 --> 03:10:29.537]  His dad had written, prepared a book to be released about now.
[03:10:29.577 --> 03:10:37.364]  I guess he figured that Jeb would be taking a lot of flack in his campaign right now because of things that his brother did with Iraq, for example.
[03:10:38.004 --> 03:10:42.609]  And so he's got this book that he just released that throws Cheney and Rumsfeld under the bus.
[03:10:42.729 --> 03:10:43.309]  I agree with that!
[03:10:43.369 --> 03:10:44.551]  Throw them under the bus!
[03:10:45.609 --> 03:10:47.050]  Back it up, run over him again.
[03:10:47.811 --> 03:10:48.151]  Fine.
[03:10:48.671 --> 03:10:51.913]  But that doesn't relieve your son of the responsibility.
[03:10:51.993 --> 03:10:53.735]  He was president, okay?
[03:10:54.055 --> 03:11:03.101]  We're going to talk about that and we're going to talk about something else the American government doesn't want to take responsibility for, and that is the shooting in Afghanistan, the Kunduz Hospital.
[03:11:03.541 --> 03:11:08.485]  Doctors Without Borders released their report today, said staff were shot.
[03:11:09.065 --> 03:11:11.549]  While they were fleeing the burning building.
[03:11:12.251 --> 03:11:14.174]  This is an attack that went on for 30 minutes.
[03:11:14.254 --> 03:11:20.064]  And of course, you can always have a hospital hit by accident with bombs or munition or whatever.
[03:11:20.084 --> 03:11:21.587]  But when you have a sustained attack...
[03:11:22.501 --> 03:11:31.326]  Even after you have called the Afghan government, called the Pentagon, told them that you're under attack, and they sustain it for 30 minutes?
[03:11:32.107 --> 03:11:33.207]  This is a war crime, folks.
[03:11:33.227 --> 03:11:35.649]  We're going to talk about that, as well as what the U.S.
[03:11:35.669 --> 03:11:37.650]  government did to push back on that.
[03:11:38.210 --> 03:11:42.473]  Now, before I go to those articles, let me tell you that today we've got a new sale on BrainForce.
[03:11:42.793 --> 03:11:47.696]  An unprecedented 25% off of BrainForce, one of our most popular formulations.
[03:11:48.746 --> 03:11:50.087]  Something that I use every day.
[03:11:50.187 --> 03:11:56.992]  Unlike most energy drinks and supplements, Brain Force uses natural brain activation ingredients to supercharge your mind.
[03:11:57.012 --> 03:12:01.076]  It has hundreds of five-star reviews on Infowarslife.com.
[03:12:01.136 --> 03:12:02.617]  Let me read you a couple of those real quickly.
[03:12:02.717 --> 03:12:06.640]  USMC Patriot from Fort Pierce, Florida says, an amazing compound.
[03:12:06.680 --> 03:12:08.241]  Makes you feel like you're 19 again.
[03:12:08.681 --> 03:12:11.384]  At 40, that is nice to feel again.
[03:12:11.404 --> 03:12:12.645]  Here's another one from
[03:12:13.405 --> 03:12:15.327]  Take Life by the Horns in Atlanta, Georgia.
[03:12:15.367 --> 03:12:17.829]  It says, I started taking the product three weeks ago.
[03:12:17.929 --> 03:12:19.190]  It's been something else.
[03:12:19.391 --> 03:12:21.372]  It gives me a lot of positive, focused energy.
[03:12:21.893 --> 03:12:23.614]  Also gives me drive to get things done.
[03:12:23.675 --> 03:12:25.236]  It's a natural energy that feels great.
[03:12:25.256 --> 03:12:28.739]  I also noticed that it makes my mood great, even on stressful days.
[03:12:28.799 --> 03:12:31.702]  I've given it to other people to try.
[03:12:31.742 --> 03:12:33.684]  They love it and want to order it for themselves.
[03:12:33.744 --> 03:12:35.605]  I wish I could have bought this when it came out.
[03:12:36.445 --> 03:12:37.386]  You have to try this.
[03:12:37.486 --> 03:12:38.786]  Well, you can read these reviews.
[03:12:38.806 --> 03:12:42.108]  They're certified by our trusted third-party review system called Power Reviews.
[03:12:42.588 --> 03:12:44.550]  You can look at that as well as other products that we sell.
[03:12:44.570 --> 03:12:50.373]  But again, Brain Force, 25% off at salebeginstoday at infowarslife.com.
[03:12:51.193 --> 03:12:52.134]  Let's take a look at the TPP.
[03:12:53.413 --> 03:12:54.754]  New Zealand released this first.
[03:12:54.774 --> 03:12:57.556]  I think all the governments involved decided they would release it today.
[03:12:57.576 --> 03:13:00.498]  And of course, the day begins in New Zealand.
[03:13:01.699 --> 03:13:08.965]  They pointed out, and now some American sources have said that it's 2,000 pages, but they're saying it's 6,000 pages.
[03:13:09.005 --> 03:13:11.467]  See, we don't know what's in it yet.
[03:13:11.887 --> 03:13:18.652]  There is so much information there that even though they took a month to release it, we still don't know exactly what is in it.
[03:13:19.092 --> 03:13:20.634]  Yet, I thought it was very interesting.
[03:13:21.354 --> 03:13:29.160]  That the AP came out with just a glowing review of this, saying details of the controversial Pacific trade deal are released.
[03:13:29.180 --> 03:13:36.085]  They say it is mind-boggling in detail, but they already know what's in it, even though it's so large.
[03:13:36.105 --> 03:13:38.947]  They say it is chock-full of good intentions.
[03:13:39.047 --> 03:13:39.588]  I'm serious!
[03:13:39.988 --> 03:13:44.031]  This is what passes for objective journalism in the United States.
[03:13:44.051 --> 03:13:48.935]  This is the Associated Press, the revered mainstream backbone here.
[03:13:50.404 --> 03:13:53.285]  Things like Reuters, AP, New York Times, okay?
[03:13:53.325 --> 03:13:55.066]  These are the people we're supposed to respect.
[03:13:55.406 --> 03:14:00.167]  This is what they say of an agreement that they couldn't possibly have read and analyzed right now.
[03:14:00.187 --> 03:14:00.987]  We'll tell you why.
[03:14:01.448 --> 03:14:03.168]  But they tell you, they sum it up, well, that's great.
[03:14:03.188 --> 03:14:06.009]  You know, people were concerned because it was being done in secret.
[03:14:06.069 --> 03:14:10.471]  Critics complained about it being forged in secret, but it is chock full of good intentions.
[03:14:10.911 --> 03:14:11.771]  These negotiators
[03:14:12.051 --> 03:14:22.736]  Have agreed to promote environmental sustainability, respect rights and needs of indigenous people, temper protections for drug patients with safeguards for public health, and access to medicines.
[03:14:22.776 --> 03:14:24.516]  I mean, you know what's not to like about that?
[03:14:26.137 --> 03:14:27.758]  What a piece of propaganda!
[03:14:28.338 --> 03:14:37.182]  And then they go on and say, you know, instead of saying no amendments will be allowed, which I consider to be a bug, they say that's a feature and this is the way they report it.
[03:14:37.921 --> 03:14:40.603]  Lawmakers can't nitpick the deal with amendments.
[03:14:41.884 --> 03:14:42.625]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:14:42.885 --> 03:14:44.526]  They're not going to have any say, folks.
[03:14:44.627 --> 03:14:45.487]  Isn't that a great thing?
[03:14:46.108 --> 03:14:51.892]  Isn't that a great thing that our Congress agreed to subvert the Constitution for a treaty?
[03:14:51.952 --> 03:14:52.873]  Because that's what this is.
[03:14:52.933 --> 03:14:53.434]  It's a treaty.
[03:14:53.874 --> 03:14:56.816]  They said, we're going to ignore the constitutional process for a treaty.
[03:14:56.856 --> 03:14:57.217]  Why not?
[03:14:57.697 --> 03:15:01.480]  They've ignored the Constitution for their illegal war on drugs for 44 years.
[03:15:01.500 --> 03:15:06.163]  They needed an amendment to prohibit alcohol, but they prohibit everything now, unless it's expressly permitted.
[03:15:06.444 --> 03:15:10.106]  So yeah, why should they worry about the process for running a trade treaty through?
[03:15:10.667 --> 03:15:11.247]  Just ignore it.
[03:15:11.888 --> 03:15:15.670]  And the good news is, they can't nitpick it with those little pesky amendments.
[03:15:15.710 --> 03:15:16.931]  They can't hold it up.
[03:15:16.971 --> 03:15:24.057]  It's got a time frame where if they don't bring it to the table to vote on it, it will automatically go there.
[03:15:25.046 --> 03:15:27.989]  Well, in terms of New Zealand, let's look at what some people there are saying.
[03:15:28.870 --> 03:15:38.641]  This report from New Zealand says, the deal is a boon to New Zealand exporters, wiping tariffs on a range of goods exported to the United States, Japan, Canada, Mexico, Peru.
[03:15:38.661 --> 03:15:45.448]  See, every government is telling, and the press of every government, I should say, is telling their people, this is great!
[03:15:45.788 --> 03:15:46.569]  You guys won!
[03:15:47.366 --> 03:15:47.866]  You guys won.
[03:15:48.187 --> 03:15:50.468]  We just hammered the other guys.
[03:15:50.508 --> 03:15:54.290]  I mean, they're all talking like Donald Trump, just, you know, after he negotiates a deal.
[03:15:54.370 --> 03:15:55.051]  We won!
[03:15:55.091 --> 03:15:56.192]  We kicked these guys.
[03:15:56.212 --> 03:15:57.412]  We got everything we wanted.
[03:15:57.973 --> 03:15:59.714]  The American worker's going to be doing great.
[03:15:59.774 --> 03:16:05.878]  Meanwhile, the New Zealand people are telling them the same thing, and it's like every government wants you to think that they won.
[03:16:06.898 --> 03:16:13.643]  They say the government estimates this is going to be worth $2.7 billion a year by 2030 for New Zealand, at a minimum, at a minimum.
[03:16:14.603 --> 03:16:16.645]  Well, some skeptics come back and they say, well,
[03:16:17.361 --> 03:16:17.901]  I don't know.
[03:16:18.702 --> 03:16:25.124]  They've been coy about who has done this analysis, especially on the projections of $2.7 billion benefits for the economy.
[03:16:25.144 --> 03:16:26.625]  And he points this out.
[03:16:26.645 --> 03:16:32.307]  He says, it's not clear whether this will start a 90-day countdown before Obama is allowed to sign the agreement.
[03:16:33.588 --> 03:16:35.369]  An analyst from New Zealand
[03:16:36.357 --> 03:16:44.120]  Said, actually, not from New Zealand, TPP opponent, I'm not sure where this professor is from, Jane Kelsey, said the legal text was not enough on its own.
[03:16:44.180 --> 03:16:51.924]  We need to see the background documents that help make sense of the text, but the parties have vowed to keep them secret for another six years.
[03:16:52.624 --> 03:16:54.145]  In other words, the life of the agreement.
[03:16:54.645 --> 03:16:58.847]  So, we're not allowed to see the background legal documents to help understand this.
[03:16:59.787 --> 03:17:00.887]  That's going to remain secret.
[03:17:01.248 --> 03:17:01.988]  Isn't that interesting?
[03:17:02.468 --> 03:17:03.368]  The public can't see it.
[03:17:03.769 --> 03:17:05.189]  Our elected representatives can't see it.
[03:17:05.709 --> 03:17:07.190]  But the stakeholders can see it.
[03:17:07.830 --> 03:17:09.471]  Because you are not a stakeholder.
[03:17:10.171 --> 03:17:14.713]  You don't have a stake in the future if they run this through the way they want to run it through.
[03:17:15.495 --> 03:17:17.557]  Now again, RT has comments on it.
[03:17:17.577 --> 03:17:19.779]  They say the negotiations lasted for five years.
[03:17:19.819 --> 03:17:25.304]  Yes, Obama has said the main target of the accord was to oust the Chinese dominance in the region.
[03:17:26.044 --> 03:17:31.969]  So they hold the Chinese up as the straw man and say, we've got to do this because they're killing us on trade, folks.
[03:17:32.910 --> 03:17:34.311]  This is the way we're going to get this back.
[03:17:34.412 --> 03:17:34.672]  All right.
[03:17:34.992 --> 03:17:40.117]  Senator Sessions looked at all this and Senator Sessions pointed out this is a living agreement.
[03:17:40.816 --> 03:17:46.221]  We can look at it, and we can analyze the 2,000 pages, we can analyze it, the 6,000 pages, if you put all that together.
[03:17:46.241 --> 03:17:50.705]  That's what the New Zealand government is telling us, the American government is telling us is 2,000 pages.
[03:17:52.026 --> 03:17:59.913]  We can look at all that, we can analyze that, maybe not completely because we can't see a lot of stuff that's going to be held secret for the life of the agreement.
[03:18:00.133 --> 03:18:01.374]  The agreement goes for six years.
[03:18:01.414 --> 03:18:04.957]  They're not going to show us the background legal things that we need to interpret this.
[03:18:05.796 --> 03:18:06.777]  But here's the issue.
[03:18:07.438 --> 03:18:10.741]  As Senator Sessions pointed out, this is a living agreement.
[03:18:10.881 --> 03:18:11.582]  And here's the quote.
[03:18:11.882 --> 03:18:14.925]  He says, the TPP will be a living agreement.
[03:18:15.005 --> 03:18:20.291]  That means the entity itself, the Commission, will then be entitled to make it say different things.
[03:18:20.371 --> 03:18:22.393]  To eliminate provisions it doesn't like.
[03:18:22.693 --> 03:18:24.295]  To add provisions it doesn't like.
[03:18:24.395 --> 03:18:29.080]  In fact, the Commission is required to meet regularly to hear advice for changes.
[03:18:29.600 --> 03:18:36.687]  From outside groups, from inside committees on the commission, so that they can update the situation for changed circumstances.
[03:18:36.707 --> 03:18:42.933]  In other words, not only can they change it, they're going to have regularly scheduled meetings to change it.
[03:18:43.454 --> 03:18:53.284]  And those changes will take place without any further involvement, of course there hasn't been any involvement yet from our elected representatives or any of the elected representatives from any of the countries involved.
[03:18:53.965 --> 03:19:01.569]  It's simply been corporate lobbyists who've been putting this together, but they won't ask us for any changes, and there won't be any up or down votes on those changes.
[03:19:01.609 --> 03:19:12.376]  Those changes will take effect, and as he pointed out, not only can they change all of the details, anything and everything that's in these 2,000 to 6,000 pages, they can also add whoever they wish.
[03:19:12.996 --> 03:19:21.401]  So they could add China tomorrow, after they scare everybody about how this has to be done to counter China, they can then add China to the agreement.
[03:19:22.742 --> 03:19:23.863]  And he also had this to say.
[03:19:24.283 --> 03:19:26.164]  This is going back a few months ago.
[03:19:26.244 --> 03:19:37.790]  This is in the summer when Senator Sessions went there and read it and put together a PowerPoint, not a PowerPoint, it was cards that he had printed up, showing it to the people in the Senate as if they cared.
[03:19:38.210 --> 03:19:39.811]  He was the only one who cared about this.
[03:19:39.851 --> 03:19:41.372]  He was the only one who cared to look at this.
[03:19:41.632 --> 03:19:46.514]  He tried to tell them the entire purpose is for Congress to surrender its power to the executive branch.
[03:19:46.554 --> 03:19:48.135]  That's what they were doing with the Promotion Authority.
[03:19:48.335 --> 03:19:51.477]  He says, why do we have to create a transnational union?
[03:19:52.057 --> 03:19:57.393]  That has the impact on the laws of the United States that creates something that is essentially like the European Union.
[03:19:57.453 --> 03:19:57.894]  Stay with us.
[03:19:58.195 --> 03:19:58.897]  We'll be right back.
[03:20:11.397 --> 03:20:15.618]  Earthquake, floods, winter storms, prolonged power outages, or war.
[03:20:16.038 --> 03:20:19.778]  Each of us have had that moment when we recognize that we need to be better prepared.
[03:20:20.319 --> 03:20:21.559]  We typically do the same thing.
[03:20:21.699 --> 03:20:24.239]  We start with food storage, then we address the need for water.
[03:20:24.719 --> 03:20:26.340]  But have you considered heat storage?
[03:20:26.940 --> 03:20:28.720]  I'm talking about staying warm in the cold.
[03:20:29.140 --> 03:20:30.820]  Here are some things for you to consider.
[03:20:31.420 --> 03:20:32.801]  How will I keep my family warm?
[03:20:33.081 --> 03:20:35.521]  The standard answers are firewood, coal, or propane.
[03:20:35.561 --> 03:20:39.622]  But the problem with that, if you need to be on the move, is you can't take it with you.
[03:20:40.442 --> 03:20:41.163]  Another concern?
[03:20:41.563 --> 03:20:45.226]  There may come a time when you need to stay warm without smoke, like in times of war.
[03:20:45.547 --> 03:20:47.789]  There may even come a time when you can't burn fuel.
[03:20:48.129 --> 03:20:51.332]  The answers may be simpler and less costly than you think.
[03:20:52.113 --> 03:20:54.555]  For these answers, go to FortressClothing.com.
[03:20:54.915 --> 03:20:58.879]  Again, FortressClothing.com has the answers to your heat storage dilemma.
[03:20:59.559 --> 03:21:00.900]  Don't get stuck in the cold.

[03:21:03.223 --> 03:21:04.564]  You'll never be cold again.

[03:21:10.145 --> 03:21:11.426]  You can't survive without it.
[03:21:11.627 --> 03:21:12.527]  But where do you get it?

[03:22:56.425 --> 03:22:58.546]  Heart and Body Extract gets results.

[03:24:14.657 --> 03:24:15.218]  Watch me!
[03:24:16.181 --> 03:24:17.282]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:24:17.302 --> 03:24:19.723]  I'm David Knight, your host on this Thursday, November 5th, 2015.
[03:24:19.763 --> 03:24:24.927]  We're talking about the release of the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
[03:24:24.967 --> 03:24:26.308]  The text has finally come out.
[03:24:26.348 --> 03:24:35.274]  Of course, no one has had time to read it, but we are seeing glowing reviews in the mainstream press saying that it's basically one of the best things that's ever happened.
[03:24:36.034 --> 03:24:42.799]  It has really good intentions, but they couldn't possibly have read this thing in this amount of time and done any analysis of it.
[03:24:44.056 --> 03:24:45.318]  But here's what's going on with this.
[03:24:45.458 --> 03:24:49.363]  Understand there are three mechanisms that are happening right now to create global governance.
[03:24:49.403 --> 03:24:53.548]  The first one is to erase existing sovereignty lines.
[03:24:53.568 --> 03:24:55.331]  That's what's going on with the open borders.
[03:24:55.371 --> 03:25:01.659]  That's what's going on with the massive flow of people from the third world into Europe and into America.
[03:25:03.106 --> 03:25:08.092]  That is to destroy the culture, to destroy the national sovereignty, to erase those borders.
[03:25:08.132 --> 03:25:10.115]  Then they need to erect something in its place.
[03:25:10.656 --> 03:25:13.479]  And we have two mechanisms that are happening right now to do that.
[03:25:14.140 --> 03:25:18.065]  One of them, of course, is going to be these partnerships, these global trade agreements.
[03:25:18.866 --> 03:25:21.030]  Those are not only trade agreements.
[03:25:21.190 --> 03:25:23.854]  Those are political and economic unions.
[03:25:23.914 --> 03:25:26.839]  That was what Senator Sessions told us when he looked at that.
[03:25:26.899 --> 03:25:33.549]  He said, this is, first of all, handing over this authority to a transnational committee that can change the rules of this at will.
[03:25:34.130 --> 03:25:37.032]  That means that they can tax, they can regulate our economy.
[03:25:37.352 --> 03:25:42.155]  This unelected, unaccountable, international body can do that after this is passed.
[03:25:42.675 --> 03:25:43.756]  So that's one aspect of it.
[03:25:44.156 --> 03:25:55.443]  Another way that they will come at us with a global governance, so we'll have the ability to tax and to regulate us, is through the climate change agreement that they're going to be working on in the beginning of, well, the beginning of December.
[03:25:55.463 --> 03:25:59.186]  Actually, it starts November 30th to, I think, December the 13th, if I remember the dates correctly.
[03:25:59.226 --> 03:26:00.727]  First couple of weeks of December.
[03:26:01.806 --> 03:26:03.569]  When will this TPP go through?
[03:26:03.709 --> 03:26:16.129]  Well, a lot of people are saying they don't think that it is going to come up for a vote until sometime after the first of the year, because when you look at the Fast Track Authority, where Congress abdicated its constitutional duty
[03:26:17.247 --> 03:26:17.687]  I think so.
[03:26:37.237 --> 03:26:39.938]  They have 30 days it needs to be presented to the public.
[03:26:40.418 --> 03:26:43.618]  They also have 45 days on which to act on it.
[03:26:44.178 --> 03:26:47.279]  But that doesn't mean that they have to take all 45 of those days.
[03:26:47.659 --> 03:26:56.681]  If you look at the Trade Promotion Authority, what it says is that if they don't do anything in 45 days, then it will come out of committee, it will be presented on the floor for a vote.
[03:26:57.121 --> 03:26:59.721]  So that's the maximum amount of time.
[03:27:00.302 --> 03:27:01.882]  The only condition that I see here
[03:27:02.702 --> 03:27:12.248]  When I look at this, and I could be wrong, I'm not a lawyer, and we need to have lawyers' eyes on this, but when I look at this, what it says is that the public has this for 30 days.
[03:27:12.468 --> 03:27:24.636]  And then at that point, this is why they say, the release of the negotiating text to the public prior to the agreements being signed by the administration, the final text of the implementing legislation and a draft agreement must be submitted to Congress 30 days prior to its introduction.
[03:27:25.056 --> 03:27:28.679]  So that means that after the public has had 30 days to look at it, they can introduce it.
[03:27:29.798 --> 03:27:34.120]  That means that they could do this during the holidays, which is when they like to do this stuff.
[03:27:34.140 --> 03:27:36.320]  That's when they passed the Federal Reserve Act.
[03:27:36.400 --> 03:27:37.941]  They did that on Christmas Eve.
[03:27:38.221 --> 03:27:47.884]  We had on New Year's Eve, Obama signed the NDAA saying the military could retain people indefinitely without trial, without due process.
[03:27:47.904 --> 03:27:52.426]  They like to sneak these things through during the holidays when no one is paying attention.
[03:27:53.386 --> 03:27:57.869]  And so I think that they're still going to, that they're on schedule to release this around the holidays.
[03:27:57.929 --> 03:28:00.810]  Understand, 45 days is the maximum amount of time.
[03:28:00.950 --> 03:28:03.852]  If nobody, if they wanted to delay this thing, they could take that long.
[03:28:04.332 --> 03:28:06.934]  But if they want to go right away to a vote, and why wouldn't they?
[03:28:07.034 --> 03:28:08.454]  Paul Ryan O supports it.
[03:28:08.534 --> 03:28:09.735]  Mitch McConnell supports it.
[03:28:09.795 --> 03:28:10.756]  Obama supports it.
[03:28:11.636 --> 03:28:13.958]  So, it could be passed by them immediately.
[03:28:13.998 --> 03:28:18.462]  Now, the President can't sign it for 90 days, but he's already said he's going to sign it.
[03:28:18.522 --> 03:28:20.204]  That's a non-issue.
[03:28:20.724 --> 03:28:23.326]  The issue is whether it will pass through Congress.
[03:28:23.607 --> 03:28:31.314]  There will be no amendments, there will be no filibusters, they will have 20 hours maximum to talk about this when it is put through.
[03:28:31.334 --> 03:28:31.894]  That was the
[03:28:33.075 --> 03:28:35.499]  That was what was agreed to with the Trade Promotion Authority.
[03:28:36.040 --> 03:28:42.511]  So there is not going to be any way to delay this thing once it comes to the floor, and it can come to the floor anytime 30 days after today.
[03:28:42.611 --> 03:28:45.056]  So we could look at early December where this could happen.
[03:28:45.489 --> 03:28:52.877]  The only person that I've seen so far that's had a reaction to this is Senator Sanders, Bernie Sanders, Sandinista, the Socialist.
[03:28:52.897 --> 03:28:54.058]  He is right on a lot of things.
[03:28:54.098 --> 03:28:56.580]  He is right on civil liberties issues.
[03:28:56.620 --> 03:28:58.362]  He is right on this TPP.
[03:28:58.863 --> 03:29:07.552]  He doesn't support it for some of the reasons that many of us do, or oppose it, I should say, for some of the reasons, but he is right in terms of the fact that it's going to set up
[03:29:08.192 --> 03:29:09.133]  A global governance.
[03:29:09.653 --> 03:29:13.195]  He says the text of the Trans-Pacific Partnership has finally been released.
[03:29:13.235 --> 03:29:14.315]  It's even worse than I thought.
[03:29:14.355 --> 03:29:20.898]  It's clear to me the proposed agreement is not, nor has it ever been, the gold standard of trade agreements.
[03:29:20.978 --> 03:29:25.340]  Well, he addresses a few of the points that are there just as Senator Sessions.
[03:29:25.360 --> 03:29:30.183]  You've got somebody who's one of the most conservative senators in Congress, Senator Sessions.
[03:29:30.623 --> 03:29:46.440]  And somebody who is arguably one of the most liberal, Bernie Sanders, both saying this is bad because we're losing control of our economy to multinational corporations and the committees that they've set up in secret in this agreement.
[03:29:46.480 --> 03:29:48.062]  We ought to start paying attention, folks.
[03:29:48.343 --> 03:29:49.404]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[03:29:58.038 --> 03:30:01.024]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[03:30:01.985 --> 03:30:04.650]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:09.100 --> 03:30:13.765]  In Florida they call me Jeb because I earned it.
[03:30:13.985 --> 03:30:14.706]  Poor Jeb.
[03:30:15.006 --> 03:30:19.110]  I got a lot of really cool things that I could do other than sit around being miserable.
[03:30:19.230 --> 03:30:20.752]  Jeb just got some more bad news.
[03:30:20.972 --> 03:30:28.260]  While both Trump and Carson would beat Hillary in Florida, former Florida Governor Jeb would lose to Hillary in the Republican-leaning state.
[03:30:30.782 --> 03:30:34.704]  And with that news, Jeb's exclamation mark went completely flaccid.
[03:30:35.265 --> 03:30:37.046]  And his comments got even stranger.
[03:30:37.186 --> 03:30:38.046]  I love my dad.
[03:30:38.287 --> 03:30:38.927]  I'd kill for him.
[03:30:39.127 --> 03:30:41.068]  I'd go to prison for him because I love him so much.
[03:30:41.328 --> 03:30:44.330]  Well, I'm sure that comes up around the Bush dinner table, but come on.
[03:30:44.610 --> 03:30:47.312]  The Bushes, just like the Clintons, are too big to jail.
[03:30:47.412 --> 03:30:48.813]  They called me Vito Corleone.
[03:30:49.173 --> 03:30:50.094]  More like Fredo.
[03:30:50.394 --> 03:30:53.856]  Jeb's campaign finance woes highlight a problem with super PACs.
[03:30:54.096 --> 03:30:58.759]  Candidates can't pay their staff from super PACs because they presumably don't control them.
[03:30:59.219 --> 03:31:03.811]  An election is an advanced auction of stolen goods, and the super PACs are where you place your bets.
[03:31:05.174 --> 03:31:07.079]  For InfoWars Nightly News, I'm David Knight.
[03:31:08.621 --> 03:31:09.401]  Alex Jones here.

[03:31:27.971 --> 03:31:29.452]  We need to be self-sufficient.
[03:31:29.572 --> 03:31:34.735]  And if you don't have high-quality, long-lasting, storable foods, I believe you're making a huge mistake.

[03:32:07.557 --> 03:32:11.622]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[03:32:11.902 --> 03:32:17.949]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing
[03:32:18.029 --> 03:32:18.389]  We're good.
[03:32:38.243 --> 03:32:39.183]  Brain Force is here.
[03:32:39.383 --> 03:32:41.484]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[03:32:41.584 --> 03:32:46.325]  You've probably noticed I've been more focused, less brain fog, more energy, and it's because of Brain Force.
[03:32:46.586 --> 03:32:49.726]  There's always hidden additives in your food, even organic food has hidden additives.
[03:32:49.867 --> 03:32:53.068]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[03:32:53.348 --> 03:32:55.168]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[03:32:55.328 --> 03:32:57.189]  It doesn't have stimulants, it doesn't have garbage in it.
[03:32:57.429 --> 03:32:59.349]  It has natural things that do it clean.
[03:32:59.429 --> 03:33:04.951]  You will find Brain Force and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[03:33:11.562 --> 03:33:17.565]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:33:18.186 --> 03:33:21.227]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:33:22.668 --> 03:33:26.911]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:26.971 --> 03:33:28.651]  I'm David Knight, your host on this Thursday.
[03:33:28.691 --> 03:33:30.512]  Joining me now is Jakari Jackson.
[03:33:31.193 --> 03:33:32.754]  We have a lot of news we want to go over.
[03:33:32.894 --> 03:33:36.676]  Before we do, Jakari, I want to tell people about this article that came out today.
[03:33:36.776 --> 03:33:39.818]  Multiple reports about Doctors Without Borders.
[03:33:40.598 --> 03:33:43.361]  Final report about this shooting in the Kunduz Hospital.
[03:33:43.941 --> 03:33:55.832]  And of course what they're reporting now is that many staff described seeing people being shot, most likely from a plane, as people tried to flee the main hospital building that was being hit with each airstrike.
[03:33:56.152 --> 03:34:01.316]  Some accounts mention shootings that appear to follow the movements of the people who were running.
[03:34:02.113 --> 03:34:09.822]  Doctors Without Borders doctors and other medical staff were shot while running to reach safety in a different part of the compound.
[03:34:10.503 --> 03:34:10.683]  Wow.
[03:34:10.743 --> 03:34:11.985]  Absolutely amazing, Jakari.
[03:34:12.285 --> 03:34:15.789]  This is an attack that went on for a half hour, okay?
[03:34:16.090 --> 03:34:19.734]  They had notified American government and Afghan government.
[03:34:20.615 --> 03:34:25.176]  Officials telling them, giving them the GPS coordinates, telling them that this was a hospital.
[03:34:25.216 --> 03:34:29.297]  As they point out here, the facility, which opened in 2011, was the only one of its kind in the region.
[03:34:29.677 --> 03:34:33.478]  It had performed more than 15,000 surgeries since its opening.
[03:34:34.078 --> 03:34:41.340]  The report said it was also one of the only buildings in the city that had full electricity from generator power on the night of the airstrikes.
[03:34:41.380 --> 03:34:42.640]  In other words, it was lit up as well.
[03:34:43.340 --> 03:34:49.444]  And you can understand in the fog of war when there is a bomb that hits a hospital.
[03:34:49.685 --> 03:34:50.625]  That's unavoidable.
[03:34:50.665 --> 03:34:57.890]  That's one of the reasons why we need to be careful and not just casually go into war to start a war because we know there's going to be collateral damage.
[03:34:57.910 --> 03:34:58.531]  There always is.
[03:34:58.591 --> 03:34:59.852]  But when you have a sustained attack,
[03:35:00.512 --> 03:35:01.213]  For a half hour.
[03:35:01.793 --> 03:35:03.315]  This is a war crime.
[03:35:03.715 --> 03:35:11.443]  And they pointed out in this report, they also said no armed combatants or weapons were found within the compound, no fighting in the direct vicinity of the hospital at the time of the airstrike.
[03:35:11.503 --> 03:35:13.304]  There was no battle going on at the time either.
[03:35:13.665 --> 03:35:13.925]  Okay?
[03:35:14.265 --> 03:35:18.309]  And we got four different stories from the American government in four different days.
[03:35:19.531 --> 03:35:21.833]  And every one of those was radically different.
[03:35:22.714 --> 03:35:23.394]  And I want to
[03:35:24.761 --> 03:35:34.911]  cover this article that i started to talk about uh... one sunday uh... right after this happened it was reported then russia attacked nine hospitals in syria
[03:35:36.937 --> 03:35:38.458]  And I don't think that that's true.
[03:35:38.798 --> 03:35:44.562]  I mean, we actually picked up that story from the Daily Caller, the New York Times was talking about it, the Wall Street Journal.
[03:35:45.023 --> 03:35:47.084]  This is an echo that went around the world.
[03:35:47.104 --> 03:35:51.007]  You know what they say about a lie, it can travel around the world before the truth gets its pants on, right?
[03:35:51.027 --> 03:35:51.267]  Yeah.
[03:35:51.567 --> 03:35:52.768]  Okay, well that's what happened with this.
[03:35:52.808 --> 03:36:00.734]  And I want to read you, and break this down, from Tony Cartolucci, talking about the incredible expanding lie of Russia's bombing of Syrian hospitals.
[03:36:01.374 --> 03:36:05.457]  Now, he points out that this information first came out on AFP.
[03:36:05.858 --> 03:36:07.899]  They called it a field hospital when it came to light.
[03:36:07.919 --> 03:36:13.824]  They said it was met with immediate skepticism, even by critics of Russia, because of who was reporting this.
[03:36:13.844 --> 03:36:16.887]  It was a so-called Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.
[03:36:17.707 --> 03:36:21.350]  This is actually not an institution, it is a single individual.
[03:36:21.410 --> 03:36:23.192]  His name is Rami Abdel-Rahman.
[03:36:23.892 --> 03:36:27.195]  He is based in the UK, so he's not observing anything.
[03:36:28.296 --> 03:36:31.598]  He calls it the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, but he's not observing anything.
[03:36:31.638 --> 03:36:32.359]  He's in the UK.
[03:36:32.779 --> 03:36:37.583]  He's been caught coordinating his reports with the foreign office there in London.
[03:36:38.164 --> 03:36:44.509]  Now they say the clinic in question was allegedly run by the Syrian American Medical Society, SAMS.
[03:36:44.929 --> 03:36:50.474]  They say it's a multi-million dollar US-based NGO supported by the US State Department.
[03:36:50.894 --> 03:36:55.905]  And they've been involved in channeling money to terrorist organizations like most of the American...
[03:36:56.897 --> 03:37:07.502]  Organizations, NGOs, State Department facilities have been doing that to so-called moderate rebels that now we learn, you know, of course, are Al-Nusra, they're Al-Qaeda, they're ISIS.
[03:37:07.642 --> 03:37:08.122]  Absolutely.
[03:37:08.382 --> 03:37:21.748]  And then this goes on, Jakari, it says that our initial reports from the ground show that we have lost two hospital staff, a physiotherapist and a nurse, but they spoke on condition of anemone and they would not specify whether or not these strikes were even conducted by Russian warplanes.
[03:37:22.168 --> 03:37:23.369]  But then it got picked up.
[03:37:23.689 --> 03:37:28.731]  The International Business Times picked up an article, Russian airstrike hits hospitals in Syria.
[03:37:28.791 --> 03:37:29.592]  So that's not one.
[03:37:29.952 --> 03:37:33.193]  It goes from one to three, then to four, then it goes to seven.
[03:37:33.493 --> 03:37:36.195]  And then by the time we picked it up, it was up to nine.
[03:37:36.375 --> 03:37:36.675]  Okay?
[03:37:37.115 --> 03:37:39.216]  And that's where this thing traveled around.
[03:37:39.276 --> 03:37:40.817]  Everybody started piling onto this.
[03:37:41.257 --> 03:37:47.040]  And then after several days of this, Russia came out and said, all right, we've been hearing this narrative from NATO countries.
[03:37:47.420 --> 03:37:49.181]  Show us the evidence or shut up.
[03:37:49.941 --> 03:37:50.502]  And they shut up.
[03:37:51.223 --> 03:37:51.623]  They shut up.
[03:37:51.743 --> 03:37:52.224]  That's simple.
[03:37:52.424 --> 03:37:52.844]  Exactly.
[03:37:52.905 --> 03:37:53.685]  It's just that simple.
[03:37:53.705 --> 03:37:55.327]  But that's what we see going on.
[03:37:55.387 --> 03:37:58.191]  That's how lies spread through the media.
[03:37:58.511 --> 03:38:04.358]  And speaking of lies, let's talk about this, what came out with Jeb Bush's dad.
[03:38:04.558 --> 03:38:05.819]  He just released his book.
[03:38:06.840 --> 03:38:11.103]  And of course, I say, after years of holding back, former President George H.W.
[03:38:11.123 --> 03:38:14.705]  Bush has finally broken his public silence about key figures in his son's administration.
[03:38:14.745 --> 03:38:21.249]  So, Jakari, I think at this point in time, they expected that Jeb would still be a player in the election, okay?
[03:38:21.569 --> 03:38:24.271]  Yeah, it would be a good thing to tack it on to.
[03:38:24.751 --> 03:38:25.151]  Exactly.
[03:38:25.431 --> 03:38:28.532]  So he comes out and he attacks Cheney, says Cheney built his own empire.
[03:38:28.892 --> 03:38:31.272]  He says of Rumsfeld, I don't like what he did.
[03:38:31.653 --> 03:38:32.913]  I think it hurt the president.
[03:38:33.673 --> 03:38:37.834]  He says he became very hard-lined, very different from the Dick Cheney that I knew.
[03:38:37.854 --> 03:38:39.854]  He says I was never close to him anyway.
[03:38:39.914 --> 03:38:42.635]  There's a lack of humility, a lack of seeing what the other guy thinks.
[03:38:42.975 --> 03:38:45.136]  He's more kick-ass and take names, take numbers.
[03:38:45.176 --> 03:38:46.336]  I think he paid a price for that.
[03:38:46.616 --> 03:38:47.916]  Rumsfeld was an arrogant fellow.
[03:38:48.156 --> 03:38:51.637]  I mean this is this is Jeb Bush's dad talking about all this stuff, right?
[03:38:52.198 --> 03:38:56.159]  And saying that, you know, these guys, they undermined his previous son because, you know...
[03:38:57.545 --> 03:39:05.389]  W got us into the war in Iraq, and everybody knows now, as a well-established fact, that they lied to get us into that war.
[03:39:05.469 --> 03:39:08.590]  Yeah, because I believe the very famous clip is Rumsfeld.
[03:39:08.610 --> 03:39:13.172]  I think there's a clip of Cheney too, but Rumsfeld is saying, we know they have weapons of mass destruction.
[03:39:13.352 --> 03:39:13.552]  Yeah.
[03:39:13.752 --> 03:39:15.853]  You know, and you have a similar clip with Cheney.
[03:39:15.873 --> 03:39:16.354]  Paul Powell.
[03:39:16.754 --> 03:39:18.975]  Yeah, and all these guys who were in on it.
[03:39:19.055 --> 03:39:22.636]  So, of course it makes them look bad, and I know Bush Sr.
[03:39:22.697 --> 03:39:23.297]  also didn't like
[03:39:24.257 --> 03:39:28.041]  Cheney, because his views on the CIA, some of the things he let slip surrounding those guys.
[03:39:28.061 --> 03:39:31.664]  So, of course, being a big CIA proponent, he wasn't a fan of Cheney.
[03:39:31.864 --> 03:39:34.847]  Yeah, so he's going to throw these guys under the bus in order to save Jeb.
[03:39:34.867 --> 03:39:38.510]  And I think they knew, I mean, they have to have a large lead time with this.
[03:39:38.550 --> 03:39:42.154]  It just shows how carefully they orchestrate all this stuff, okay?
[03:39:42.194 --> 03:39:49.200]  They have this book that's going to come out where the dad dumps on the people who undermined and messed up W's administration, okay?
[03:39:49.460 --> 03:39:50.281]  It wasn't his fault.
[03:39:50.541 --> 03:40:01.187]  And yet we know, just as we had this couple of clips, I did one as a one minute, Darren McBreen did another one where he put in the quote from W, you know, he tried to kill my dad.
[03:40:01.487 --> 03:40:02.848]  Talking about Saddam Hussein, right?
[03:40:03.048 --> 03:40:06.030]  And just this last week we had Jeb say, I love my dad.
[03:40:06.270 --> 03:40:07.230]  I'd kill for my dad.
[03:40:07.411 --> 03:40:08.731]  I'd go to prison for my dad.
[03:40:08.911 --> 03:40:09.712]  Of course they would.
[03:40:10.252 --> 03:40:10.633]  Exactly.
[03:40:10.653 --> 03:40:11.694]  Not that that would ever happen.
[03:40:12.015 --> 03:40:13.136]  Well, yes, exactly.
[03:40:13.737 --> 03:40:19.624]  No Bushes are going to go to prison any more than any Clintons are going to go to prison, but of course, Jakari, he would send you to die.
[03:40:19.964 --> 03:40:20.284]  Oh, yes.
[03:40:20.485 --> 03:40:25.751]  Okay, he would send your son to die in a foreign war that we don't have any business in getting at.
[03:40:26.071 --> 03:40:28.314]  And then, of course, there's this whole nonsense about how
[03:40:29.515 --> 03:40:30.736]  W wasn't responsible for this.
[03:40:30.817 --> 03:40:33.719]  It was Rumsfeld and Cheney who were responsible for this.
[03:40:33.819 --> 03:40:35.441]  Let me read you what Jeb said.
[03:40:36.181 --> 03:40:37.723]  Jeb is trying to get tough.
[03:40:37.743 --> 03:40:39.865]  Here's an article from the Weekly Standard.
[03:40:39.905 --> 03:40:41.166]  Jeb tries shouting.
[03:40:41.286 --> 03:40:42.487]  You can see the pictures of Jeb.
[03:40:42.848 --> 03:40:48.973]  He's now appearing without a tie, without even a jacket, because his new slogan is, Jeb can fix it.
[03:40:49.574 --> 03:40:51.936]  He's no longer part of a political dynasty.
[03:40:51.996 --> 03:40:52.817]  He's a plumber now.
[03:40:53.257 --> 03:40:53.797]  Exactly.
[03:40:54.118 --> 03:40:55.298]  He's now every man.
[03:40:56.259 --> 03:41:00.361]  He's one of us, because he's not wearing a tie or jacket.
[03:41:00.982 --> 03:41:03.663]  And his slogan is, Jed can fix it.
[03:41:03.703 --> 03:41:04.624]  But this is what he said.
[03:41:04.664 --> 03:41:07.265]  He said, the president can't say it's somebody else's fault.
[03:41:07.285 --> 03:41:10.087]  The president can't say you're fired and go to a commercial break.
[03:41:10.307 --> 03:41:14.109]  And that's always my issue with these guys, because I talk to people about Vietnam.
[03:41:14.129 --> 03:41:16.791]  And of course, there's a lot of things going on before we got involved.
[03:41:17.091 --> 03:41:19.553]  But you have, who was it, McNamara telling LBJ
[03:41:20.333 --> 03:41:21.474]  And there's actually this thing.
[03:41:21.594 --> 03:41:24.176]  Anybody who hasn't been to Austin, there's the LBJ Museum.
[03:41:24.616 --> 03:41:25.296]  And there's this thing.
[03:41:25.376 --> 03:41:26.217]  I didn't want to go in there.
[03:41:26.237 --> 03:41:27.098]  Somebody dragged me in there.
[03:41:27.118 --> 03:41:33.262]  But there's this thing where you're supposed to be LBJ on the phone with McNamara, given the information that you were given at the time.
[03:41:33.282 --> 03:41:36.044]  He says, Mr. President, I got off a talking incident.
[03:41:36.324 --> 03:41:37.565]  And then you have these options, right?
[03:41:37.945 --> 03:41:39.266]  And you have to choose what you're going to do.
[03:41:39.466 --> 03:41:42.528]  And of course, knowing what I know, I choose not to invade Vietnam.
[03:41:42.788 --> 03:41:48.052]  And because I did that, the planet was destroyed, according to this sensational thing they have up there.
[03:41:48.332 --> 03:41:49.853]  But to my point on Vietnam,
[03:41:50.213 --> 03:41:50.435]  We're good.
[03:41:50.868 --> 03:41:54.370]  You know, what Jeb's saying, they can't say anybody was wrong.
[03:41:54.430 --> 03:41:56.112]  Let's say LBJ knew nothing about it.
[03:41:56.132 --> 03:41:58.433]  He would just write off a press release that those guys handed to him.
[03:41:59.094 --> 03:42:06.318]  Afterwards, you have guys like McNamara who go on book tours saying that all this stuff they knew was fraudulent, it was wrong, he said it was a mistake to go in.
[03:42:06.579 --> 03:42:08.740]  But nobody went to prison.
[03:42:08.980 --> 03:42:12.262]  That's the issue with these presidencies and this unaccountability.
[03:42:12.703 --> 03:42:16.105]  I'd say the president didn't know, but when the truth comes out, somebody needs to go to prison.
[03:42:16.365 --> 03:42:16.725]  Absolutely.
[03:42:17.106 --> 03:42:20.308]  You're talking about that, and in that documentary with Errol Morris, The Fog of War,
[03:42:21.128 --> 03:42:27.352]  Uh, Robert McNamara, shortly before he died, said, uh, yeah, we knew that, that, that it really wasn't an attack in the Gulf of Tonkin.
[03:42:27.672 --> 03:42:27.832]  Yeah.
[03:42:27.872 --> 03:42:28.613]  We lied about that.
[03:42:29.113 --> 03:42:33.856]  And he talked, though, he didn't say, you know, that, well, we should go to prison because we started the Vietnam War.
[03:42:34.276 --> 03:42:38.099]  What he said was, we should go to prison because of the fire bombings that we conducted in Japan.
[03:42:38.319 --> 03:42:38.499]  Yeah.
[03:42:38.659 --> 03:42:40.881]  Because he knows that nobody's going to send him to prison for
[03:42:41.621 --> 03:42:45.786]  For World War II, that was, in most people's minds, a just war.
[03:42:46.927 --> 03:42:52.033]  Most people looked at that as, you know, we were attacked without provocation and we defended ourselves and so forth.
[03:42:52.053 --> 03:42:55.497]  So he could safely say, well, we should have gone to jail as war criminals in World War II.
[03:42:55.517 --> 03:42:59.922]  He wouldn't say we should go to jail as war criminals for Vietnam, because we might take him up on that offer.
[03:43:00.723 --> 03:43:09.207]  And he also pointed out in that documentary that when he met with people from North Vietnam, decades later, they were slamming their fists on the table and said, you idiot.
[03:43:09.667 --> 03:43:11.247]  We fought the Chinese for independence.
[03:43:11.367 --> 03:43:13.788]  This whole thing about the domino theory is total nonsense.
[03:43:13.848 --> 03:43:14.889]  And so, yeah, absolutely.
[03:43:15.309 --> 03:43:17.090]  I guess I don't know what Jeb is going to fix.
[03:43:17.130 --> 03:43:18.911]  He's got the fix-it bus.
[03:43:19.071 --> 03:43:21.952]  He's gotten rid of his blackened out SUV.
[03:43:22.012 --> 03:43:26.374]  He's now got a bus so he can bring the press on and he can be warm and inviting.
[03:43:26.594 --> 03:43:28.735]  And he's got on the side of the bus, Jeb can fix it.
[03:43:28.855 --> 03:43:29.395]  So I don't know.
[03:43:29.975 --> 03:43:30.676]  The bus is broken.
[03:43:30.696 --> 03:43:33.898]  He needs to fix his own campaign before he goes out there and fixes the country.
[03:43:33.958 --> 03:43:38.501]  Yeah, well see the problem is, Jakari, he doesn't even know what is broken.
[03:43:39.181 --> 03:43:39.482]  Okay?
[03:43:39.962 --> 03:43:41.963]  The public knows that our borders are broken.
[03:43:42.504 --> 03:43:43.584]  Jeb doesn't want to fix that.
[03:43:44.165 --> 03:43:44.505]  Okay?
[03:43:44.865 --> 03:43:46.727]  And they know a lot of other things are broken.
[03:43:46.747 --> 03:43:48.488]  They know that Common Core is broken.
[03:43:48.568 --> 03:43:49.749]  But Jeb doesn't want to fix that either.
[03:43:49.769 --> 03:43:51.550]  He doesn't want to fix the mistakes of his own family.
[03:43:51.690 --> 03:44:05.033]  Yeah, well he worked with Bill Gates to enact a Common Core curriculum, and of course that's what he said was, you know, oh well, you know, the money that we gave ten million dollars to Planned Parenthood, but we were actually trying to promote Common Core, and it's like, really?
[03:44:05.073 --> 03:44:07.454]  That should come back in the debate.
[03:44:07.814 --> 03:44:12.695]  Let's take a look at some of the things that we were in the news today, our InfoWars site here.
[03:44:13.355 --> 03:44:16.376]  Bill Maurer was making fun of InfoWars.
[03:44:17.376 --> 03:44:28.482]  It was reporting on the story that bacon gives you cancer and his take on it was, well, okay, I guess now people are going to say, well, cancer is not a problem because they're not about to give up their bacon.
[03:44:28.702 --> 03:44:33.665]  So what they did was they photoshopped a ridiculous headline, cancer.
[03:44:34.225 --> 03:44:36.366]  Is it bad for you or is it a government hoax?
[03:44:36.667 --> 03:44:39.168]  And they put InfoWars up on top of that, as you can see right there.
[03:44:39.208 --> 03:44:41.029]  Let's run that clip and then we'll talk about it.
[03:44:42.267 --> 03:44:52.352]  New rule, now that they've declared that bacon causes cancer, the World Health Organization must face the fact that instead of reconsidering bacon, most Americans are going to reconsider cancer.
[03:44:55.914 --> 03:44:59.056]  I can see it now on the websites that real Americans read.
[03:44:59.096 --> 03:45:00.957]  Cancer, bad for you, or government hoax!
[03:45:02.197 --> 03:45:04.598]  Cancer, eat all the bacon you want and still lose weight!
[03:45:05.779 --> 03:45:08.660]  And you know who else's cells mutate uncontrollably?
[03:45:08.861 --> 03:45:09.481]  The X-Men!
[03:45:11.024 --> 03:45:11.384]  There you go.
[03:45:11.404 --> 03:45:13.604]  So they put us up there with Fox and Red State.
[03:45:13.724 --> 03:45:22.586]  So the thing about that is, just like I believe in the article they have it linked, I think it was Comedy Central did a piece as well when they put us in with Michael Jackson being abducted by aliens or whatever else.
[03:45:23.066 --> 03:45:26.547]  A lot of times they won't even attack us for stuff that we say or that Alex says.
[03:45:26.807 --> 03:45:39.189]  They have to go make up something that's completely ridiculous so their viewers who have no idea about Infowars, they just hear negative things will think, oh these guys saying cancer is a conspiracy theory as if people don't have cancer.
[03:45:39.389 --> 03:45:39.970]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:45:40.010 --> 03:45:47.861]  Like Rachel Maddow would say, yeah, these guys believe that somebody had a plunger that took down, you know, the giant wasp in the Pentagon.
[03:45:47.881 --> 03:45:49.223]  Yeah, exactly, exactly.
[03:45:49.263 --> 03:45:52.867]  So, they build a straw man, they do it, and they say, oh, you know, it's just comedy.
[03:45:53.450 --> 03:45:57.753]  No, it's just psychological propaganda, is what it really is.
[03:45:57.813 --> 03:45:59.755]  That's what's really behind all of this when they do this.
[03:46:00.175 --> 03:46:05.099]  They are associating this nonsense with our logo.
[03:46:05.139 --> 03:46:05.639]  But that's alright.
[03:46:06.100 --> 03:46:07.781]  Just spell the name correctly, Bill.
[03:46:08.782 --> 03:46:09.722]  People go check it out.
[03:46:09.743 --> 03:46:13.325]  When they Google, they find out that it has no basis in reality.
[03:46:13.665 --> 03:46:14.086]  Exactly.
[03:46:14.866 --> 03:46:20.129]  Now, of course, in terms of that, we've got this new documentary that's going to be coming out from Disney.
[03:46:20.650 --> 03:46:22.731]  I talked about that at the beginning of this hour.
[03:46:22.891 --> 03:46:35.778]  Abigail Disney, the grandniece of Walt Disney, is going to examine in this documentary, this is a story from WND, Cheryl Trumley, she's going to examine if pro-gun people can simultaneously be pro-life.
[03:46:35.838 --> 03:46:39.120]  They think that there's some kind of an inherent conflict there.
[03:46:39.340 --> 03:46:42.482]  You know, this is really a propaganda documentary.
[03:46:42.782 --> 03:46:51.244]  They say, we experienced this film through the eyes of two evangelical Christians who are determined to make a change in this country's gun policy.
[03:46:51.264 --> 03:46:53.524]  And they call the film Armor of Light.
[03:46:54.164 --> 03:47:01.786]  It's about the issue of guns, but it's also a document about Christian life in America at this heightened moment of political discontent.
[03:47:01.806 --> 03:47:05.146]  And I'll read one more excerpt from this and get your comments on this, Shikari.
[03:47:05.406 --> 03:47:07.707]  They say, this documentary digs into the deep
[03:47:08.187 --> 03:47:24.156]  Affinity between the evangelical Christian movement and our country's gun culture and how one top minister and anti-abortion activists undergo a change of consciousness to challenge prevailing attitudes toward firearms among fellow Christians.
[03:47:24.696 --> 03:47:25.137]  How's that?
[03:47:25.797 --> 03:47:33.964]  Well, you know, the issue about this is anybody who actually reads the Bible can come across the passage where Christ told his followers to go buy swords.
[03:47:34.044 --> 03:47:37.367]  Now, be very clear, he didn't say go out, buy swords, and kill a bunch of people.
[03:47:37.407 --> 03:47:43.452]  He said, go out and have this means of self-defense if necessary, and even going as far as saying, sell your cloak.
[03:47:43.932 --> 03:47:46.374]  If you need to have this means of defense.
[03:47:46.694 --> 03:47:50.917]  So to say that it's somehow unchristian to be armed is completely ridiculous.
[03:47:51.198 --> 03:47:52.839]  King David, he goes out to war, what does he take?
[03:47:52.879 --> 03:47:53.600]  He takes his sword.
[03:47:53.820 --> 03:47:57.162]  He takes the armaments of the day to go out and fight the battle.
[03:47:57.202 --> 03:48:00.545]  So to say that owning a firearm is unchristian is completely ridiculous.
[03:48:00.956 --> 03:48:01.576]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:48:01.857 --> 03:48:04.158]  Jesus told his apostles to sell their cloak and get a sword.
[03:48:04.198 --> 03:48:09.742]  But, again, the broader principle of that is that we are to protect innocent life.
[03:48:10.382 --> 03:48:10.962]  Okay?
[03:48:11.062 --> 03:48:12.043]  That's the fundamental thing.
[03:48:12.323 --> 03:48:18.807]  If you have it within your power to protect innocent life and you don't do it, I mean, that's inexcusable.
[03:48:18.907 --> 03:48:21.109]  I mean, you know, Paul says, if you don't take care of your own,
[03:48:21.929 --> 03:48:23.410]  Then you're worse than an infidel.
[03:48:23.451 --> 03:48:24.832]  You've denied the faith.
[03:48:24.852 --> 03:48:30.357]  In other words, you have a responsibility to help the weak, the defenseless, anyone that you can help.
[03:48:30.757 --> 03:48:32.659]  You have a responsibility to do that.
[03:48:32.959 --> 03:48:38.364]  And that's precisely what the guy that I talked to from South Africa, he was a minister there.
[03:48:38.444 --> 03:48:39.765]  He was visiting another church.
[03:48:39.785 --> 03:48:40.626]  It wasn't his church.
[03:48:40.666 --> 03:48:44.149]  His name was Charles van Wyk.
[03:48:44.249 --> 03:48:46.992]  I have to think about that because it's a different pronunciation from South Africa.
[03:48:47.885 --> 03:48:50.806]  And he had, I think it was five shots in his pistol.
[03:48:51.027 --> 03:49:03.192]  And he always carried a pistol because at the time South Africa was undergoing a violent revolution there with the forces of Mandela and the government were fighting each other and there were guerrillas who were going around shooting people up.
[03:49:03.713 --> 03:49:09.275]  And they learned afterwards, because they had a Truth and Reconciliation Committee where they brought these guys in who had shot that church up.
[03:49:09.875 --> 03:49:14.978]  They learned afterwards these guys were able to confess because they weren't going to be prosecuted for anything that they said.
[03:49:15.720 --> 03:49:23.046]  And they said, we picked that church of about a thousand people because we knew it was in a wealthy, liberal neighborhood and we knew nobody would be armed.
[03:49:23.086 --> 03:49:25.368]  And we were surprised when we started getting shot.
[03:49:25.949 --> 03:49:31.474]  This guy was all the way up in the back corner of this mega church and these guys came in.
[03:49:31.734 --> 03:49:33.155]  They killed quite a few people.
[03:49:33.175 --> 03:49:34.516]  I can't remember the exact number.
[03:49:34.536 --> 03:49:35.637]  I think it was around 40 or 50 people.
[03:49:36.738 --> 03:49:50.047]  They came in throwing grenades and shooting with AK-47s and this guy only had a pistol and he was all the way in the back so he took a couple of shots and he didn't think he hit anything from that angle.
[03:49:50.087 --> 03:49:56.431]  So he went outside and came back around another way and they were dragging one of their comrades out who had actually hit somebody.
[03:49:56.851 --> 03:49:58.492]  One of his bullets had got one of the guys.
[03:49:58.912 --> 03:50:00.994]  So they were surprised that they were under fire.
[03:50:01.194 --> 03:50:02.175]  They pulled this guy out.
[03:50:03.015 --> 03:50:09.349]  And then he took some more shots at him from the other angle and I think got another guy and they thought that there were multiple people.
[03:50:09.369 --> 03:50:09.630]  Surrounded.
[03:50:09.710 --> 03:50:09.930]  Yeah.
[03:50:10.131 --> 03:50:11.093]  So they left.
[03:50:11.454 --> 03:50:13.438]  He saved all of those people's lives.
[03:50:14.045 --> 03:50:17.068]  Because, and he said that he had struggled with this very issue.
[03:50:17.588 --> 03:50:24.194]  At first he thought, no, no, as a Christian, I shouldn't carry a gun because I might put myself in the situation where I might harm somebody.
[03:50:24.474 --> 03:50:25.455]  But that's the issue.
[03:50:25.875 --> 03:50:27.076]  Guns can save lives.
[03:50:27.396 --> 03:50:33.362]  In the hands of a good person, they are a means of defense, of self-defense and of the defense of others.
[03:50:33.882 --> 03:50:38.306]  And it is precisely that way that guns can save lives.
[03:50:38.769 --> 03:50:40.069]  Yeah, I agree with that statement 100%.
[03:50:40.189 --> 03:50:43.070]  Like I said, it's about defense.
[03:50:43.090 --> 03:50:46.970]  You know, we're not telling anybody to go out there and have offensive violence, not at all.
[03:50:46.990 --> 03:50:54.892]  But we're saying if the situation does arise when you're carjacked or you're at the grocery store or whatever, somebody pulls out a gun at the gas station, then you can defend yourself.
[03:50:55.412 --> 03:50:56.292]  Thanks a lot, Chikari.
[03:50:56.332 --> 03:51:02.713]  And of course, the NRA beat Bloomberg's administration and the way that they put out all this money.
[03:51:02.973 --> 03:51:05.974]  They spent 30 to 1 and still kept gun rights going in Virginia.
[03:51:05.994 --> 03:51:06.834]  We're going to be right back.
[03:51:07.454 --> 03:51:07.814]  Stay with us.
[03:51:09.659 --> 03:51:11.560]  My name is Don Whiskin.
[03:51:11.640 --> 03:51:15.903]  In 1994, I lost my 62-year-old father to complications of bypass surgery.
[03:51:16.604 --> 03:51:20.406]  In 1977, my 44-year-old brother was found dead in his apartment.
[03:51:20.626 --> 03:51:21.747]  He suffered a heart attack.
[03:51:22.187 --> 03:51:25.610]  In January of 98, my mother had a stroke and passed away in her bed.
[03:51:26.070 --> 03:51:30.553]  21 days later, my 53-year-old brother passed away on his arrival to the hospital.
[03:51:30.833 --> 03:51:31.674]  He waited too long.
[03:51:32.114 --> 03:51:35.135]  In June, that same year, I almost joined them at 42.
[03:51:35.475 --> 03:51:36.115]  What did I do?
[03:51:36.355 --> 03:51:43.597]  I took a 7-herb formula I now call ExtendoVite made from garlic, cayenne, bilberry, ginkgo biloba, hawthorn, milk thistle, and valerian.
[03:51:43.817 --> 03:51:51.998]  Based on German studies of natural medicine, ExtendoVite is designed to clear blocked arteries, clean the toxins from your blood, and improve your immune system.
[03:51:52.239 --> 03:51:53.739]  To get your ExtendoVite, call 1-877-928-8822.
[03:51:53.759 --> 03:51:54.119]  That's 1-877-928-8822.
[03:52:00.802 --> 03:52:09.608]  Alex Jones here.

[03:53:11.141 --> 03:53:15.382]  Earthquake, floods, winter storms, prolonged power outages, or war.
[03:53:15.782 --> 03:53:19.522]  Each of us have had that moment when we recognize that we need to be better prepared.
[03:53:20.063 --> 03:53:21.323]  We typically do the same thing.
[03:53:21.463 --> 03:53:23.983]  We start with food storage, then we address the need for water.
[03:53:24.483 --> 03:53:26.104]  But have you considered heat storage?
[03:53:26.684 --> 03:53:28.484]  I'm talking about staying warm in the cold.
[03:53:28.904 --> 03:53:30.564]  Here are some things for you to consider.
[03:53:31.184 --> 03:53:32.565]  How will I keep my family warm?
[03:53:32.825 --> 03:53:35.285]  The standard answers are firewood, coal, or propane.
[03:53:35.305 --> 03:53:39.366]  But the problem with that, if you need to be on the move, is you can't take it with you.
[03:53:40.191 --> 03:53:40.912]  Another concern?
[03:53:41.312 --> 03:53:44.974]  There may come a time when you need to stay warm without smoke, like in times of war.
[03:53:45.295 --> 03:53:47.556]  There may even come a time when you can't burn fuel.
[03:53:47.876 --> 03:53:51.079]  The answers may be simpler and less costly than you think.
[03:53:51.859 --> 03:53:54.301]  For these answers, go to FortressClothing.com.
[03:53:54.661 --> 03:53:58.644]  Again, FortressClothing.com has the answers to your heat storage dilemma.
[03:53:59.324 --> 03:54:00.665]  Don't get stuck in the cold.
[03:54:01.326 --> 03:54:02.627]  FortressClothing.com.
[03:54:02.967 --> 03:54:04.308]  You'll never be cold again.
[03:54:20.595 --> 03:54:22.417]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:54:22.457 --> 03:54:24.879]  I'm David Knight and joining me now is Leanne McAdoo.
[03:54:24.919 --> 03:54:31.384]  Leanne is going to be doing the nightly news tonight and we're going to talk to her about a trailer that's going to be previewing.
[03:54:31.565 --> 03:54:36.068]  We're going to preview here in just a moment about this trip that she took to St.
[03:54:36.108 --> 03:54:39.531]  Louis, the toxic waste dump that's on fire.
[03:54:39.571 --> 03:54:42.014]  They're headed towards a nuclear waste dump, is that correct?
[03:54:43.134 --> 03:54:43.934]  And we're going to get to that.
[03:54:44.134 --> 03:54:47.415]  Just before we do, though, I want to let you know that BrainForce is back in stock.
[03:54:47.435 --> 03:54:50.476]  We have an unprecedented sale on it.
[03:54:50.496 --> 03:54:52.196]  25% off of BrainForce.
[03:54:52.676 --> 03:54:58.938]  Unlike most energy drinks and supplements, BrainForce uses natural brain activation to supercharge your mind.
[03:54:58.978 --> 03:55:00.678]  It's my favorite thing that we sell here.
[03:55:00.698 --> 03:55:02.459]  And now you can get it at 25% off.
[03:55:02.859 --> 03:55:04.939]  That's at Infowarslife.com.
[03:55:04.980 --> 03:55:06.740]  BrainForce at 25% off.
[03:55:07.640 --> 03:55:10.621]  Leanne, before we get to that, I was just talking to Jakari.
[03:55:11.381 --> 03:55:21.776]  About the efforts by the grand-niece of Walt Disney to try to convince people that gun ownership and Christianity are incompatible with each other, to attack the Second Amendment.
[03:55:22.608 --> 03:55:29.433]  But of course, even the First Amendment is under attack, and perhaps it's maybe in worse shape than the Second Amendment is.
[03:55:29.473 --> 03:55:30.473]  This is an article here.
[03:55:30.793 --> 03:55:34.436]  A poll of college students reveals little regard for free speech.
[03:55:34.496 --> 03:55:38.078]  They went and they polled 800 undergrads at Yale University.
[03:55:38.479 --> 03:55:44.563]  They found 30% of the students who self-identified as liberal believe the First Amendment is outdated.
[03:55:45.103 --> 03:55:50.025]  A majority, 51%, favored speech codes on the campus.
[03:55:50.445 --> 03:55:52.546]  16% want even more control of free speech.
[03:55:52.986 --> 03:55:57.767]  They said 35% of the students stated so-called hate speech is not protected under the First Amendment.
[03:55:58.648 --> 03:55:58.968]  Wow.
[03:55:59.008 --> 03:55:59.308]  There you go.
[03:55:59.328 --> 03:56:08.571]  So all you have to do is say that if something is racist, sexist, homophobic, or otherwise offensive, you should get discipline for that and you don't get a chance to say it.
[03:56:08.591 --> 03:56:11.032]  And of course, that's anything that hurts somebody's feelings.
[03:56:11.592 --> 03:56:14.553]  If they say that it hurts their feelings, you don't get the chance to say that.
[03:56:14.955 --> 03:56:18.819]  Isn't America going to be a completely different place here in just a few years?
[03:56:18.959 --> 03:56:24.204]  It's just wild to think about these people getting out and being the leaders of the new world.
[03:56:24.504 --> 03:56:24.985]  Absolutely.
[03:56:25.405 --> 03:56:29.949]  Before we run out of time, I want to play this trailer of what you're going to go over tonight on the Nightly News.
[03:56:29.969 --> 03:56:30.710]  Let's run that trailer.
[03:56:30.750 --> 03:56:33.292]  This is what's happening in St.
[03:56:33.332 --> 03:56:33.573]  Louis.
[03:56:36.042 --> 03:56:40.843]  My house was downwind about 1.5 miles from where the original pile sat out.
[03:56:41.023 --> 03:56:45.765]  And I was one of the children who played in the creek with my brother, all the neighborhood kids.
[03:56:45.865 --> 03:56:48.285]  We had our own forts.
[03:56:48.405 --> 03:56:50.986]  I mean, we played in the creek all day in the summers.
[03:56:51.106 --> 03:56:53.027]  We'd ice skate it during the winters.
[03:56:53.627 --> 03:56:54.527]  We loved that creek.
[03:56:54.707 --> 03:56:56.647]  You know, it was a really fun time.
[03:56:56.668 --> 03:57:01.849]  And now to think that we were playing in poison, it doesn't really...
[03:57:03.283 --> 03:57:20.001]  You can't take away those good memories for me, so I'm still trying to hold on to some of the good, but it's just mind-bending to think that here we are, children, we're having the time of our lives, and it was eventually going to kill a lot of people, and we had no idea.
[03:57:22.748 --> 03:57:26.010]  In the early 1940s, the nuclear arms race was on.
[03:57:26.490 --> 03:57:27.090]  A local St.
[03:57:27.130 --> 03:57:32.754]  Louis corporation played a significant role in the development of the first nuclear weapons during World War II.
[03:57:33.214 --> 03:57:39.938]  As part of the Manhattan Project, Mallinckrodt Chemical Works began processing their uranium for the first atomic bomb.
[03:57:40.338 --> 03:57:44.740]  But by the mid-1940s, the company had run out of space at its downtown St.
[03:57:44.760 --> 03:57:50.904]  Louis location, so it began to ship the radioactive waste off-site to an underpopulated area north of St.
[03:57:50.944 --> 03:57:51.204]  Louis.
[03:57:51.624 --> 03:57:58.985]  The radioactive materials were stored in bulk, on the ground, open to the elements, and unattended next to Coldwater Creek.
[03:58:02.270 --> 03:58:09.775]  Many people have difficulty understanding how silent, invisible rays, which cannot even be felt, could be so damaging.
[03:58:10.355 --> 03:58:12.517]  Our bodies are made up of millions of cells.
[03:58:12.777 --> 03:58:14.958]  They're the building blocks of our blood and tissues.
[03:58:15.278 --> 03:58:18.421]  When radiation penetrates the body, the cells are injured.
[03:58:18.661 --> 03:58:24.104]  Most of them can repair themselves if the total dose, over a period of time, is not too high.
[03:58:24.244 --> 03:58:28.227]  But if radiation continues, the cells will be destroyed beyond repair.
[03:58:37.119 --> 03:58:44.044]  Again, that's gonna premiere tonight, the part one of that documentary that Josh Owens and Leanne McAdoo did, and Leanne will be doing the news tonight.
[03:58:44.465 --> 03:58:46.606]  Join us then, 7 Central, 8 p.m.
[03:58:46.707 --> 03:58:47.027]  Eastern.
[03:58:50.329 --> 03:58:52.171]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[03:58:52.911 --> 03:58:54.132]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[03:58:58.675 --> 03:59:08.601]  Most of the InfoWars radio listening audience is aware of the high-quality, affordable firearms available that are made right here in America at HDFirearms.com.
[03:59:08.801 --> 03:59:14.764]  One of the most exciting things about HDFirearms.com is the ability to upgrade your AR-15 platform today.
[03:59:14.924 --> 03:59:17.086]  They call it their low-profile platform.
[03:59:17.246 --> 03:59:20.507]  PVX muzzle brakes, proven to help control muzzle rise.
