[00:00:04.864 --> 00:00:06.166]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.166 --> 00:00:07.948]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:07.948 --> 00:00:09.710]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:11.292]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.292 --> 00:00:12.834]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.834 --> 00:00:17.019]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.019 --> 00:00:21.084]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:24.637 --> 00:00:27.638]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show on this Monday, April 20th, 2015.
[00:00:27.638 --> 00:00:28.739]  I'm David Knight.
[00:00:28.739 --> 00:00:30.199]  I'll be your host today.
[00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:33.120]  We have a lot of breaking news.
[00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.582]  One of the things that's coming out, it's going to be coming out in the next few days, and Rand Paul has been leaking it.
[00:00:37.582 --> 00:00:40.143]  It was at the top of the Drudge Report earlier.
[00:00:40.143 --> 00:00:44.685]  And that is the Clinton cash question.
[00:00:44.685 --> 00:00:49.467]  Of course, she's been going around trying to paint herself as one of all of us.
[00:00:49.467 --> 00:00:52.868]  And she's essentially making herself a laughing stock.
[00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:57.060]  It's absolutely absurd for her to talk about how she's one of us.
[00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:58.500]  Going to Chipotle.
[00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.541]  And of course, that game was joined by Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio.
[00:01:02.541 --> 00:01:07.683]  They played their own little Chipotle games, talking about how much more common they were than Hillary.
[00:01:07.683 --> 00:01:11.784]  How they could relate to the common man even more so than Hillary.
[00:01:11.784 --> 00:01:13.664]  But there's a new book that's coming out in a couple of weeks.
[00:01:13.664 --> 00:01:15.245]  Rand Paul's been talking about it.
[00:01:15.245 --> 00:01:17.825]  The New York Times got an early release of it.
[00:01:17.825 --> 00:01:20.046]  Drudge has a link to that article.
[00:01:21.092 --> 00:01:23.314]  And they basically are going to break it down.
[00:01:23.314 --> 00:01:30.378]  And it looks like there's evidence in their book, in their research, that's what they allege, of pay for play.
[00:01:30.378 --> 00:01:33.901]  We've always said that elections are an advanced auction of stolen goods.
[00:01:33.901 --> 00:01:34.461]  That was H.L.
[00:01:34.461 --> 00:01:36.863]  Mencken, quoted, made that statement.
[00:01:36.863 --> 00:01:38.143]  That's very true.
[00:01:38.143 --> 00:01:44.588]  But it's also a way that you can get things to happen immediately when Hillary Clinton is Secretary of State.
[00:01:44.588 --> 00:01:49.051]  And of course, they go back all the way to Mr. Clinton's administration, pointing out what's going on with that.
[00:01:49.051 --> 00:01:50.732]  We're going to break that down further in the broadcast.
[00:01:51.372 --> 00:01:59.734]  And of course there's also an article up, we'll talk about this in the next segment, by one measure Hillary earned more than America's top 10 CEOs.
[00:01:59.734 --> 00:02:01.714]  That's by her hourly compensation.
[00:02:01.714 --> 00:02:07.136]  That's one of the ways that you can buy influence legally with politicians.
[00:02:07.136 --> 00:02:08.916]  What do we do about Washington?
[00:02:08.916 --> 00:02:10.096]  How do we pull this in?
[00:02:10.096 --> 00:02:13.317]  Are we going to make some rules that say you can't do that?
[00:02:14.182 --> 00:02:17.285]  And then have the government police itself?
[00:02:17.285 --> 00:02:18.826]  That's not going to happen.
[00:02:18.826 --> 00:02:19.647]  We see that all the time.
[00:02:19.647 --> 00:02:21.768]  They don't police themselves on anything.
[00:02:21.768 --> 00:02:26.872]  As a matter of fact, the Congress just steps back and lets people have their own way.
[00:02:26.872 --> 00:02:28.934]  They let the bureaucracy have their own way.
[00:02:28.934 --> 00:02:32.217]  They let foreign governments and multinationals have their own way.
[00:02:32.217 --> 00:02:35.079]  They basically have become passive.
[00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:40.063]  It's almost like watching the results of the Enabling Act in 1933 with Adolf Hitler.
[00:02:40.063 --> 00:02:42.165]  That was when the Reichstag came in and said,
[00:02:42.925 --> 00:02:49.451]  They signed a piece of paper that said, we're going to let you, Mr. Hitler, write all the rules from here on out.
[00:02:50.185 --> 00:02:52.485]  And that's essentially what our government has done.
[00:02:52.485 --> 00:02:55.846]  They did it this last week, on Wednesday.
[00:02:55.846 --> 00:03:02.568]  The fast track of the fast track trade agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership and Trans-Atlantic Partnership.
[00:03:02.568 --> 00:03:10.609]  They already had this being negotiated in private, in secret, by corporate lobbyists and our own trade representative.
[00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:16.530]  But of course, the American people and their elected representatives can't see what's going on, can't talk about what's going on.
[00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.471]  There's a non-disclosure agreement on that.
[00:03:19.281 --> 00:03:27.019]  So it was already on a fast track, but what they did this last week, on Wednesday, was they fast tracked the fast track agreement.
[00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:32.643]  So you're going to see these things coming at us fast and furious, and you know what?
[00:03:32.643 --> 00:03:39.669]  This is essentially a major, major step towards global governance by multinational corporations.
[00:03:39.669 --> 00:03:40.750]  I'm going to break that down for you.
[00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:48.596]  This is the actual implementation of the Trilateral Commission strategy, their whole reason for being, their whole structure.
[00:03:48.596 --> 00:03:55.502]  We're now seeing it as we have these regional trade blocs, North America as well as Europe, being consolidated.
[00:03:56.082 --> 00:03:59.486]  And we can see one of the results of that now going on in Greece.
[00:03:59.486 --> 00:04:05.191]  We see that Greece is ordering raids on government coffers as cash dwindles.
[00:04:05.191 --> 00:04:15.001]  This is something they're ordering a mandatory transfer of cash reserve data, cash reserves from their state-owned enterprises to the central bank.
[00:04:15.001 --> 00:04:18.485]  This is something that we saw happening in Venezuela, didn't we?
[00:04:19.502 --> 00:04:33.689]  In Venezuela, Bloomberg was bragging about the fact that even though the people of Venezuela had no money for food, water, medicine, they had to go to other countries to get it, nevertheless, the bankers who were loaning them money were making 700% return on investment.
[00:04:35.934 --> 00:04:39.336]  We're seeing the same thing happening now in Europe.
[00:04:39.336 --> 00:04:40.597]  And what's the solution, they say?
[00:04:40.597 --> 00:04:45.580]  The solution is to go to a United States of Europe to give up sovereignty.
[00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:48.281]  That's the only way that's going to be safe, says Alan Greenspan and others.
[00:04:48.281 --> 00:04:48.681]  Stay with us.
[00:04:48.681 --> 00:04:50.642]  We're going to break this down further for you.
[00:04:50.642 --> 00:04:51.343]  We'll be right back.
[00:05:00.021 --> 00:05:05.526]  There's no doubt that our country is in serious trouble right now.
[00:05:05.526 --> 00:05:10.890]  And if you're wondering how on earth we ever got in this situation, well I'll tell you how.
[00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:16.375]  When the Democrats showed their true colors, you got angry and you elected Republicans.
[00:05:16.915 --> 00:05:22.617]  And then when the Republicans showed their true colors, you got angry and elected Democrats.
[00:05:22.617 --> 00:05:32.640]  And when anyone suggested to you that both parties were corrupt, and that neither side were looking out for your best interest, you acted like they were crazy.
[00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:41.488]  But the real definition of crazy is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.
[00:05:41.488 --> 00:05:47.774]  That's why it is vitally important that you wake up, America, and break the matrix.
[00:05:47.774 --> 00:05:53.139]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv, and the Alex Jones Show.
[00:05:53.139 --> 00:05:55.542]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:05:58.780 --> 00:05:59.700]  Hey, how you doing, Al?
[00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:00.280]  Good, brother.
[00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:02.021]  Just recently started using your products.
[00:06:02.021 --> 00:06:03.962]  Everything you said about them is correct.
[00:06:03.962 --> 00:06:07.983]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them, and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[00:06:07.983 --> 00:06:08.723]  Well, thank you, brother.
[00:06:08.723 --> 00:06:13.024]  It's because it also funds our operation, but doing that, I know I've got to have the highest quality.
[00:06:13.024 --> 00:06:20.987]  Super Mill Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[00:06:21.207 --> 00:06:24.431]  We did the super male and the super female vitality.
[00:06:24.431 --> 00:06:25.973]  Big changes, a lot of energy.
[00:06:25.973 --> 00:06:28.856]  We've gotten off of the cheap energy drinks, energy shots.
[00:06:28.856 --> 00:06:30.678]  They've been a ton of money there.
[00:06:30.678 --> 00:06:36.084]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs harvested around the planet and then concentrated
[00:06:36.144 --> 00:06:37.345]  We're good to go.
[00:06:58.942 --> 00:07:00.023]  Hi, I'm Alex Jones.
[00:07:00.023 --> 00:07:08.049]  When I got on air 20 years ago, I weighed 180 pounds, I lifted weights 5 days a week, I could swim 2-3 miles.
[00:07:08.049 --> 00:07:11.212]  Then I discovered the New World Order, the globalists, their agenda.
[00:07:11.212 --> 00:07:13.173]  I started an access television show.
[00:07:13.173 --> 00:07:18.557]  I was so dedicated to my work, and hanging around with radio guys, that I began drinking.
[00:07:18.557 --> 00:07:21.420]  I began smoking cigars, and then even cigarettes.
[00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:28.005]  I transformed from looking like a white Bruce Lee to looking like a Jabba the Hutt.
[00:07:28.005 --> 00:07:33.269]  So I began a journey five years ago to shed the almost 100 pounds.
[00:07:33.269 --> 00:07:38.153]  I started taking super male vitality and saw dramatic results in just a few weeks.
[00:07:38.433 --> 00:07:45.838]  When I added to the mix the key products developed by Dr. Groot for Infowarslife.com, the results were incredible.
[00:07:45.838 --> 00:07:51.161]  Take the Infowarslife.com challenge today at Infowarslife.com or give our crew a call.
[00:07:51.161 --> 00:07:54.123]  They can answer all your questions or tell you about any of the specials at 888-253-3139.
[00:08:10.819 --> 00:08:12.945]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:08:12.945 --> 00:08:14.830]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:08:21.018 --> 00:08:22.860]  I'm David Knight, your host today.
[00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:29.887]  We're going to be joined later in the show, Leanne McAdoo and Jakari Jackson are both going to come in and talk about some of the breaking stories on InfoWars.com.
[00:08:29.887 --> 00:08:39.136]  Of course, we have a story right now at the top of InfoWars.com, a video of a cop shooting a dog in a crowded area and people saying, you almost shot me.
[00:08:39.136 --> 00:08:40.997]  You know, it's gotten to the point where
[00:08:41.918 --> 00:08:44.500]  We're looking at this dog.
[00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:53.087]  The old saying is that when a dog bites a man, it's not a news story, but when a man bites a dog, it is a news story because it's unusual.
[00:08:53.087 --> 00:09:01.053]  I guess in that vein, you know, a cop shooting a dog or shooting a person is not really that much of a news story anymore.
[00:09:01.053 --> 00:09:08.019]  When I went to CNN, the top story at CNN today was, this officer didn't shoot.
[00:09:08.982 --> 00:09:10.805]  I guess that's the top story.
[00:09:10.805 --> 00:09:14.811]  I guess that's a story when a cop actually doesn't shoot somebody.
[00:09:14.811 --> 00:09:19.818]  The story says the officer shows great restraint in not shooting a charging suspect.
[00:09:19.818 --> 00:09:23.864]  Now this is a situation where probably he would have been justified to shoot somebody.
[00:09:25.151 --> 00:09:30.234]  It's gotten to the point now where we don't have much control over the police.
[00:09:30.234 --> 00:09:40.020]  They basically only have to say that they felt that they were in danger, felt that they were threatened, and then of course the system will give them carte blanche to use deadly force.
[00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:44.202]  And that's something we really need to have a national debate about.
[00:09:44.202 --> 00:09:50.265]  And that debate is beginning, but unfortunately it gets sidetracked along those lines of racial profiling.
[00:09:51.513 --> 00:10:03.030]  You know, when you talk about what's going on and when you talk about the fact that we need to do something about this, quite often people will pull in and say, well, there's a lot of crime in the black community.
[00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:04.953]  There's a lot of illegitimacy in the black community.
[00:10:05.871 --> 00:10:09.054]  That really doesn't have anything to do with it.
[00:10:09.054 --> 00:10:12.396]  You know, that's a red herring that people bring in when we start talking about that.
[00:10:12.396 --> 00:10:15.358]  We need to talk about what's going on with the police.
[00:10:15.358 --> 00:10:18.761]  And of course, they put more police officers.
[00:10:18.761 --> 00:10:20.002]  It's called a broken window policy.
[00:10:20.002 --> 00:10:22.384]  They put more police officers in poor areas.
[00:10:22.384 --> 00:10:28.689]  If you have more police officers, they are going to have more interactions with the people in the area.
[00:10:29.429 --> 00:10:33.833]  And so, there have to be strict rules about how they interact with people.
[00:10:33.833 --> 00:10:45.343]  In other words, if somebody is doing something, maybe they were doing something dangerous, but if they are now running away from you, with their back to you, with no weapon in their hand, you shouldn't be allowed to shoot them in the back.
[00:10:45.343 --> 00:10:54.611]  I know I took a conceal carry class, and I know that if I did that as an individual, I would be rightfully charged with murder, with unnecessary homicide.
[00:10:55.549 --> 00:11:00.553]  So, we shouldn't give that kind of a pass to people just because they work for the government at any level.
[00:11:00.553 --> 00:11:04.256]  And we need to have this discussion because it is out of control.
[00:11:04.256 --> 00:11:18.408]  And when we look at things like the illegitimacy rate in the black community, we need to understand, just as Walter Williams pointed out on Friday, that where the black community was a few decades ago, the white community is now.
[00:11:18.408 --> 00:11:20.730]  So, that is something that is a national problem.
[00:11:21.755 --> 00:11:32.799]  And if we look at what's going on with police brutality, we see that police brutality within the white community is probably now about where it was a few decades ago in the black community.
[00:11:32.799 --> 00:11:40.943]  So it doesn't make me feel any better when I see that there's more black people that are getting shot than white people, because I know that they're shooting white people.
[00:11:40.943 --> 00:11:49.106]  I know that that's going to be something that continues to escalate unless we address the root cause of this, unless we change the attitude of the government
[00:11:49.526 --> 00:11:50.027]  We're good to go.
[00:12:12.981 --> 00:12:22.709]  But something happened last week that I want to talk about and spend some time on, and that is the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the Trans-Atlantic Partnership, TTIP.
[00:12:22.709 --> 00:12:28.354]  We're now getting fast track of the fast track negotiating process.
[00:12:28.354 --> 00:12:29.335]  And let me explain that to you.
[00:12:30.424 --> 00:12:44.913]  The fast track process was essentially a process where they would have a trade representative from the White House, from the administration, go and negotiate with corporate lawyers, hundreds of corporate lawyers, secretly, so that the public is not allowed to see.
[00:12:44.913 --> 00:12:49.876]  Our elected representatives are not consulted or participating in this.
[00:12:51.223 --> 00:12:58.167]  But, and they can't even tell us, if they go to look at it, what's going on, because they have to sign a non-disclosure agreement.
[00:12:58.167 --> 00:13:02.209]  So the only information we get is from WikiLeaks.
[00:13:02.209 --> 00:13:05.691]  Thank you, WikiLeaks, for doing that.
[00:13:05.691 --> 00:13:13.636]  Nevertheless, what they're doing is, on Wednesday, they came together, and they had Orrin Hatch and Ron Wyden and Paul Ryan.
[00:13:15.020 --> 00:13:18.141]  Come together on a compromise to fast-track the fast-track process.
[00:13:18.141 --> 00:13:20.842]  They're going to make this secretive process go even faster.
[00:13:20.842 --> 00:13:28.966]  And understand that at the top, this is a bipartisan push, just as it was when they ran NAFTA through 20-some-odd years ago.
[00:13:30.186 --> 00:13:33.129]  It was going to happen whether Bush or Clinton was elected.
[00:13:33.129 --> 00:13:36.632]  The only person who was speaking out about it at the time was Ross Perot.
[00:13:36.632 --> 00:13:39.674]  We don't have a Ross Perot talking out about this right now.
[00:13:39.674 --> 00:13:42.337]  Essentially everybody has signed on for this.
[00:13:42.337 --> 00:13:48.502]  When you look at the Republicans who are running for president, all of them signed on to fast-tracking this.
[00:13:48.502 --> 00:13:56.509]  All of them signed on to this secret process, which is not only a devastating economic situation if we look at what's happened with NAFTA.
[00:13:57.475 --> 00:14:05.541]  It's not only a horrible thing from an economic standpoint, but it is also a sovereignty-destroying treaty.
[00:14:05.541 --> 00:14:10.064]  This is something that is part of the globalist plan that we've talked about for a very long time.
[00:14:10.064 --> 00:14:17.430]  If you go back to the Clinton and the Carter administration, and you look at Zbigniew Brzezinski, when he left there, he founded the Trilateral Commission.
[00:14:18.177 --> 00:14:20.198]  That was North America, Asia, Europe.
[00:14:20.198 --> 00:14:21.739]  Bring those together.
[00:14:21.739 --> 00:14:22.499]  What has happened now?
[00:14:22.499 --> 00:14:27.241]  We see trading blocks between, we see consolidation with NAFTA of North America.
[00:14:27.241 --> 00:14:30.483]  We see consolidation in Europe with the EU.
[00:14:30.483 --> 00:14:32.003]  All of these are being brought together.
[00:14:32.003 --> 00:14:36.305]  And America is the central hinge for this.
[00:14:36.305 --> 00:14:41.227]  For this next step to global governance by multinational corporations.
[00:14:41.227 --> 00:14:42.848]  That is what this is.
[00:14:42.848 --> 00:14:44.249]  Let's recognize this for what it is.
[00:14:45.029 --> 00:14:46.090]  I'm a libertarian.
[00:14:46.090 --> 00:14:48.031]  I understand that we want to have free trade.
[00:14:48.031 --> 00:14:50.393]  I understand that we want to have a free market.
[00:14:50.393 --> 00:14:54.556]  But we need to understand that what we have in this country is not a free market.
[00:14:54.556 --> 00:14:56.057]  We have crony capitalism.
[00:14:56.057 --> 00:15:00.560]  And when we look at these free trade agreements, these are not free trade agreements.
[00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:08.646]  Ron Paul said a long time ago, if you want to have a free trade agreement, when they were talking about NAFTA, you don't need a thousand page trade treaty.
[00:15:09.426 --> 00:15:10.867]  You just have free trade.
[00:15:10.867 --> 00:15:12.088]  You get rid of regulation.
[00:15:12.088 --> 00:15:13.570]  You don't add more regulation.
[00:15:13.570 --> 00:15:30.765]  So when you get a thousand page trade treaty, which is being negotiated in secret, which is going to be dumped on the Congress with no time for them to consider what is going on, and it's going to not allow them to make any amendments, it's going to be a straight up and down vote, they're going to be pressured to do it right away.
[00:15:30.765 --> 00:15:33.547]  They're going to be pressured by corporate lobbyists who wrote this.
[00:15:34.548 --> 00:15:38.794]  When you look at that sort of situation, you understand this is not free trade.
[00:15:38.794 --> 00:15:39.835]  This is not free trade.
[00:15:39.835 --> 00:15:41.177]  This is crony capitalism.
[00:15:41.177 --> 00:15:42.899]  This is managed trade.
[00:15:42.899 --> 00:15:46.264]  This is trade to benefit the large corporations.
[00:15:47.605 --> 00:15:51.188]  And we need to understand that this is about sovereignty.
[00:15:51.188 --> 00:15:53.410]  This is not just an economic issue.
[00:15:53.410 --> 00:16:01.216]  This treaty, unlike NAFTA, is very explicit that it goes after things that affect our digital rights with copyright.
[00:16:01.216 --> 00:16:04.379]  This is a way to put CISPA in the back door.
[00:16:04.379 --> 00:16:09.623]  This is a way to stop countries from controlling GMO, if they're concerned about that.
[00:16:10.223 --> 00:16:14.887]  Or stopping Monsanto from putting glyphosate, Roundup, into their country.
[00:16:14.887 --> 00:16:25.355]  If they're concerned, as they should be, based on the research from the Lancet, from the World Health Organization, saying that they believe that glyphosate, that Roundup, is a cause of cancer.
[00:16:25.355 --> 00:16:33.442]  If people were to ban that, then Monsanto would be able to go in and sue that government in a special court.
[00:16:34.437 --> 00:16:34.877]  It's not even
[00:16:55.396 --> 00:16:58.238]  Judgements from these arbitration processes.
[00:16:58.238 --> 00:17:00.159]  Take a look at what's going on in Greece today.
[00:17:00.159 --> 00:17:01.560]  This is a story that's on the Drudge Report.
[00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:05.743]  Greece orders a raid on government coffers as their cash is dwindling.
[00:17:05.743 --> 00:17:13.008]  The Greek government has ordered a mandatory transfer of cash reserves from state-owned enterprises to its central bank.
[00:17:13.008 --> 00:17:13.769]  Where else?
[00:17:13.769 --> 00:17:16.811]  In a desperate bid to gather enough cash to remain solvent.
[00:17:17.745 --> 00:17:22.847]  They said this cash crisis in Athens is degenerating with every passing day.
[00:17:22.847 --> 00:17:27.728]  And they point out that this decree, which would violate fiduciary obligations, well what would that be?
[00:17:27.728 --> 00:17:32.610]  That would be maybe the fiduciary obligations that they have made to their citizens.
[00:17:32.610 --> 00:17:36.871]  Don't worry, because they're going to do the same thing that Venezuela did.
[00:17:36.871 --> 00:17:39.932]  It was Bloomberg, as I mentioned in the last segment, Bloomberg
[00:17:40.936 --> 00:17:45.800]  That bragged about the fact that Venezuela was a great investment for bankers.
[00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:48.281]  It was a 700% return on investment.
[00:17:48.281 --> 00:17:48.722]  That's great!
[00:17:49.773 --> 00:17:54.235]  How could that happen when the people didn't have enough money, Bloomberg said?
[00:17:54.235 --> 00:17:58.997]  That they couldn't get water, they couldn't get food, they couldn't get medicine without going to neighboring countries.
[00:17:58.997 --> 00:18:05.881]  Ah, but they recognize that their sovereign debts to the bank take precedent over what happens to their people.
[00:18:05.881 --> 00:18:08.882]  And we see the same thing now happening in Greece.
[00:18:08.882 --> 00:18:10.603]  And look at what the bank is doing to them.
[00:18:11.411 --> 00:18:17.512]  The Greek government is having to pay 28% interest on their loans to these banks.
[00:18:17.512 --> 00:18:19.173]  28% interest.
[00:18:19.173 --> 00:18:20.653]  Credit card rates.
[00:18:20.653 --> 00:18:26.454]  Hey, I remember when credit card rates were prohibited by law from being more than 10%.
[00:18:26.454 --> 00:18:33.096]  That was before the runaway inflation of the Carter era, and then they got rid of the usury laws.
[00:18:33.096 --> 00:18:38.157]  And now we've got banks that operate openly as if they were loan sharks.
[00:18:39.079 --> 00:18:42.102]  That was what we used to call it when you charge people more than 10%.
[00:18:42.102 --> 00:18:48.508]  When you charge people the kind of interest rates that they regularly charge people on credit cards today, that was called loan sharking.
[00:18:48.508 --> 00:18:51.490]  That was something that only the mafia did.
[00:18:51.490 --> 00:18:55.434]  Now, all of the banks do that, and they're doing it to countries.
[00:18:55.434 --> 00:18:57.296]  Now, how did they respond to this?
[00:18:57.296 --> 00:18:58.357]  What's the response to this?
[00:18:58.357 --> 00:19:00.979]  Well, a lot of people said that Greece is going to leave.
[00:19:00.979 --> 00:19:05.103]  Alan Greenspan, former Federal Reserve Chairman, said Greece is going to leave.
[00:19:06.067 --> 00:19:11.871]  We also had the head of PIMCO, the world's largest bond fund, say that Greece is going to leave the EU.
[00:19:11.871 --> 00:19:20.297]  They both said, unless, unless, here's the qualifier, unless we make EU something that it isn't right now.
[00:19:20.297 --> 00:19:23.180]  Unless the member states give up sovereignty.
[00:19:24.051 --> 00:19:29.734]  And become, as Pemko's executive said, the United States of Europe.
[00:19:29.734 --> 00:19:38.038]  You see how these trade agreements, these economic agreements, metamorphosize into sovereignty agreements.
[00:19:38.038 --> 00:19:40.840]  The banks have a wonderful way of doing that, don't they?
[00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:45.122]  And that's exactly what's going to be happening with the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
[00:19:45.122 --> 00:19:45.522]  Stay with us.
[00:19:45.522 --> 00:19:50.485]  Right after the break, we're going to have some clips of what some of the senators said about this last week.
[00:19:50.485 --> 00:19:51.526]  It's very enlightening.
[00:19:51.526 --> 00:19:52.146]  We'll be right back.
[00:19:59.614 --> 00:20:00.815]  Hear that?
[00:20:00.815 --> 00:20:06.199]  That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransack the place.
[00:20:06.199 --> 00:20:09.141]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed.
[00:20:09.141 --> 00:20:12.183]  You can prevent being the next victim of a break-in.
[00:20:12.183 --> 00:20:20.248]  Go to Faketv.com and discover a device that creates the illusion someone inside is watching TV, even when you're miles away.

[00:20:29.227 --> 00:20:30.468]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:20:30.468 --> 00:20:34.951]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stock workers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[00:20:34.951 --> 00:20:40.634]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[00:20:40.634 --> 00:20:44.196]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[00:20:44.196 --> 00:20:46.918]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[00:20:46.918 --> 00:20:51.921]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[00:20:51.921 --> 00:20:52.161]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:20:52.161 --> 00:20:53.542]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:20:59.085 --> 00:21:00.205]  Hi, I'm Alex Jones.
[00:21:00.205 --> 00:21:08.247]  When I got on air 20 years ago, I weighed 180 pounds, I lift weights five days a week, I can swim two, three miles.
[00:21:08.247 --> 00:21:11.408]  Then I discovered the New World Order, the globalists, their agenda.
[00:21:11.408 --> 00:21:13.369]  I started an access television show.
[00:21:13.369 --> 00:21:18.750]  I was so dedicated to my work and hanging around with radio guys that I began drinking.
[00:21:18.750 --> 00:21:21.591]  I began smoking cigars and then even cigarettes.
[00:21:22.111 --> 00:21:28.194]  I transformed from looking like a white Bruce Lee to looking like a Jabba the Hutt.
[00:21:28.194 --> 00:21:33.456]  So I began a journey five years ago to shed the almost 100 pounds.
[00:21:33.456 --> 00:21:38.338]  I started taking super male vitality and saw dramatic results in just a few weeks.
[00:21:38.618 --> 00:21:46.020]  When I added to the mix the key products developed by Dr. Groot for InfoWarsLife.com, the results were incredible.
[00:21:46.020 --> 00:21:51.341]  Take the InfoWarsLife.com challenge today at InfoWarsLife.com or give our crew a call.

[00:21:58.798 --> 00:22:00.739]  It's very easy to be a criminal.
[00:22:00.739 --> 00:22:04.361]  All you need to burglarize a home is one simple household tool.
[00:22:04.361 --> 00:22:05.722]  A pair of scissors.
[00:22:05.722 --> 00:22:11.505]  If your home security system can be compromised by a criminal using scissors, then you're making it easy for him.
[00:22:11.505 --> 00:22:16.448]  Almost every home security system, even those sold by big-name companies, has a weakness.
[00:22:16.448 --> 00:22:17.428]  The phone line.
[00:22:17.428 --> 00:22:22.671]  You shell out $1,500, get locked into a long-term contract, and think you're safe.
[00:22:22.671 --> 00:22:26.413]  But a burglar can destroy your alarm in seconds with one snip.
[00:22:26.573 --> 00:22:29.897]  And when a burglar cuts your phone line, you're defenseless.
[00:22:29.897 --> 00:22:32.360]  SimpliSafe Home Security is the smarter choice.
[00:22:32.360 --> 00:22:36.705]  Built by Harvard engineers, SimpliSafe uses a wireless connection to call the cops.
[00:22:36.705 --> 00:22:37.806]  Scissors can't cut it.
[00:22:37.806 --> 00:22:40.269]  And that means your home stays safe.
[00:22:40.269 --> 00:22:43.853]  24-7 professional monitoring is under $15 a month with no contract.

[00:22:58.228 --> 00:23:02.051]  Last year, in the Nevada desert, one family took a stand for freedom.
[00:23:02.051 --> 00:23:06.316]  Numana Food Storage was the first and only company to support the rights of the Bundys.
[00:23:06.536 --> 00:23:12.979]  While others stood down, New Mana took donations and provided storable foods to the men at Bunkerville.

[00:23:58.934 --> 00:24:04.758]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:24:04.758 --> 00:24:07.100]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:24:07.100 --> 00:24:12.544]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:24:12.544 --> 00:24:14.846]  I'm David Knight, your host on this April 20th, 2015.
[00:24:14.846 --> 00:24:20.030]  Joining me later in the show are going to be Leanne McAdoo and Jakari Jackson.
[00:24:20.030 --> 00:24:23.052]  We're going to be talking about some of the breaking news that's coming up.
[00:24:23.052 --> 00:24:25.254]  Also, we'll be taking your calls later in the broadcast.
[00:24:26.089 --> 00:24:34.612]  Before I go back to the news, I want to let you know that we have InfoWarsLife Silver Bullet, colloidal silver, 50% off right now at the InfoWarsLife.com store.
[00:24:34.612 --> 00:24:38.334]  That's down $14.95 from his usual price of $29.95.
[00:24:38.334 --> 00:24:40.595]  Biggest sale we've ever had on colloidal silver.
[00:24:41.215 --> 00:24:43.056]  This preparedness grade is silver.
[00:24:43.056 --> 00:24:46.076]  It is concentrated to a powerful 30 parts per million.
[00:24:46.076 --> 00:24:50.498]  We've been sold out of this product for months and we think it'll happen again pretty soon.
[00:24:50.498 --> 00:24:52.318]  So right now is the time to stock up for 2015.
[00:24:52.318 --> 00:24:53.698]  Again, that's InfoWars Life Silver Bullet.
[00:24:53.698 --> 00:24:54.879]  50% off at InfoWarsLife.com
[00:24:59.700 --> 00:25:07.249]  Before I go back to the Trans-Pacific Partnership, it looks like we're losing when you look at this Trans-Pacific Partnership thing.
[00:25:07.249 --> 00:25:13.196]  It's very depressing to see how their plan that they've had for decades is coming together, how they have created these
[00:25:14.837 --> 00:25:16.979]  Blocks that were essentially trading blocks.
[00:25:16.979 --> 00:25:19.742]  They sell it to the public as a free trade area.
[00:25:19.742 --> 00:25:24.986]  Then they turn it into a sovereignty area, as they're trying to do in the EU.
[00:25:24.986 --> 00:25:37.598]  As we saw 10 years ago, the Council on Foreign Relations had its principal recommendation for what should be done about NAFTA was that we should have a border around the entire perimeter that should be policed by Homeland Security.
[00:25:38.098 --> 00:25:38.559]  We're good to go.
[00:25:54.580 --> 00:25:59.986]  We see the drug cartels, possibly terrorist organizations, anything can come through those borders.
[00:25:59.986 --> 00:26:01.107]  They're so porous.
[00:26:01.107 --> 00:26:10.637]  And I don't want to erect some kind of fence that is so concentrated that it becomes essentially a prison for Americans either.
[00:26:10.637 --> 00:26:12.880]  But we need to strike some kind of a happy medium there.
[00:26:13.988 --> 00:26:16.511]  But it explains why we're not doing anything.
[00:26:16.511 --> 00:26:25.881]  When you look at this Council on Foreign Relations report, 2005, and by the way, one of the 31 members was Ted Cruz's banker wife in that.
[00:26:25.881 --> 00:26:28.364]  She was working, I think, at the time for JPMorgan.
[00:26:28.364 --> 00:26:33.369]  She went on to work for Robert Zoellick, who was chairing that at Goldman Sachs.
[00:26:33.369 --> 00:26:34.711]  He chaired that CFR report.
[00:26:36.078 --> 00:26:36.278]  That's
[00:26:57.262 --> 00:27:21.886]  Asian trading bloc, but of course it ultimately is about sovereignty and people might start to understand that's what's going on when this is being negotiated in secret by corporate lobbyists who are giving the corporations the same power as Government and who are protecting their interest to the extent that they can slam and shut down any laws in any country that go against what they perceive to be their interest and
[00:27:21.986 --> 00:27:28.464]  But before I go back to this, I just want to point out this article that came up today on the Drudge Report.
[00:27:28.464 --> 00:27:29.326]  The Pew Center...
[00:27:30.310 --> 00:27:32.612]  That does, uh, uh, polls.
[00:27:32.612 --> 00:27:37.256]  They say gun rights now for the first time top gun control and major public opinion shift.
[00:27:37.256 --> 00:27:41.119]  In other words, we can win this if we get behind this.
[00:27:41.119 --> 00:27:53.929]  They say exactly two years after Obama's bid for gun control following the Sandy Hook shooting, a new poll has discovered a huge shift in public opinion to backing Second Amendment rights and away from controlling gun ownership.
[00:27:53.929 --> 00:27:59.294]  Now let me tell you, I had only been working at InfoWars a few months when the Sandy Hook shooting started.
[00:28:00.661 --> 00:28:06.043]  And it was a full court, all out press for Alex Jones.
[00:28:06.043 --> 00:28:12.504]  He understood that the Second Amendment and our rights were hanging by a thread.
[00:28:12.504 --> 00:28:13.785]  He pulled everything out.
[00:28:13.785 --> 00:28:15.825]  He was doing extra broadcasts.
[00:28:15.825 --> 00:28:20.006]  He was going for a couple hours afterwards, talking to people, doing everything he could.
[00:28:20.006 --> 00:28:22.547]  That's when he went on with Piers Morgan.
[00:28:22.547 --> 00:28:23.847]  It was very effective.
[00:28:23.847 --> 00:28:26.108]  We have won that debate.
[00:28:26.628 --> 00:28:29.949]  We have changed the understanding of the American people.
[00:28:29.949 --> 00:28:31.049]  It's not propaganda.
[00:28:31.049 --> 00:28:38.612]  It's simply explaining to them that you can't be safe if you turn over your safety to some people with guns and a uniform.
[00:28:38.612 --> 00:28:40.072]  It doesn't work.
[00:28:40.072 --> 00:28:41.313]  Look at what happened in Kenya.
[00:28:41.313 --> 00:28:43.053]  We've had two shootings now in Kenya.
[00:28:43.053 --> 00:28:45.194]  One at a mall, another at a university.
[00:28:45.194 --> 00:28:52.356]  Hundreds of people have died because the government wasn't there and nobody there had weapons to defend themselves.
[00:28:53.533 --> 00:29:00.015]  No matter how long it takes, and of course they took seven hours in this latest case for the government to get the military out there.
[00:29:00.015 --> 00:29:03.477]  But no matter how long they take, there's always a response time.
[00:29:03.477 --> 00:29:08.378]  10 minutes, 20 minutes, an hour before they're going to get there.
[00:29:08.378 --> 00:29:11.559]  And you never know exactly what they're going to do anyway when they get there.
[00:29:11.559 --> 00:29:14.220]  We've seen this over and over again, shooting the wrong person.
[00:29:14.220 --> 00:29:17.622]  You cannot be safe if you turn your safety over to somebody else.
[00:29:17.622 --> 00:29:18.382]  It's just like liberty.
[00:29:19.082 --> 00:29:20.363]  Liberty is never given.
[00:29:20.363 --> 00:29:22.584]  It is always taken.
[00:29:22.584 --> 00:29:27.206]  And you are going to have to take responsibility for your safety.
[00:29:27.206 --> 00:29:28.387]  And people understand that.
[00:29:28.387 --> 00:29:30.167]  For the first time, they understand that.
[00:29:30.167 --> 00:29:34.550]  And you look at these charts in this article, you can see a massive reversal.
[00:29:34.550 --> 00:29:37.751]  And I really appreciate what Alex Jones did two years ago.
[00:29:37.751 --> 00:29:38.832]  He nailed it.
[00:29:38.832 --> 00:29:39.832]  And he led that charge.
[00:29:39.832 --> 00:29:40.813]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:40.813 --> 00:29:41.213]  Stay with us.
[00:29:48.267 --> 00:29:52.208]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:52.208 --> 00:29:59.029]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:59.029 --> 00:30:02.070]  Let's talk about the real war on women.
[00:30:02.070 --> 00:30:06.391]  First wave feminism was a noble cause, but modern feminists?
[00:30:06.391 --> 00:30:06.931]  Ha!
[00:30:06.931 --> 00:30:14.853]  Well, instead of fighting for, say, paid and protected maternity leave, they want to ban words, shirts, and manspreading.
[00:30:15.293 --> 00:30:16.314]  Come on!
[00:30:16.314 --> 00:30:23.838]  That's cultural Marxism, which asserts that culture and language is responsible for oppressing women and not the state.
[00:30:23.838 --> 00:30:27.540]  The truth is, the state encourages gender wars.
[00:30:27.540 --> 00:30:31.922]  It's a divide-and-conquer tactic designed to keep us fighting amongst ourselves.
[00:30:31.922 --> 00:30:36.805]  In fact, the feminist movement was hijacked by the political class to exploit women.
[00:30:36.805 --> 00:30:40.807]  As the late Aaron Russo revealed, the Rockefellers bankrolled feminism.
[00:30:41.267 --> 00:30:47.916]  Not because they had any interest in women's rights, but because women in the workforce was the ultimate trifecta.
[00:30:47.916 --> 00:30:55.465]  The state collects more tax dollars, children are indoctrinated at an earlier age, and the traditional family structure destroyed.
[00:30:55.465 --> 00:30:58.249]  Leanne McAdoo reporting for InfoWars.com
[00:30:58.812 --> 00:31:00.192]  I want more candy!
[00:31:00.192 --> 00:31:01.193]  I want more video games!
[00:31:01.193 --> 00:31:01.313]  Mine!
[00:31:01.313 --> 00:31:01.453]  Mine!
[00:31:01.453 --> 00:31:02.013]  Mine!
[00:31:02.013 --> 00:31:11.736]  And it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and help children focus.
[00:31:11.736 --> 00:31:14.437]  All of our children are hit with modern mind control.
[00:31:14.437 --> 00:31:17.998]  Television, music, fast food, GMOs, sugars, you name it.
[00:31:17.998 --> 00:31:24.320]  Young humans have not yet developed their nervous system and are being hammered daily by globulous concoctions.
[00:31:24.320 --> 00:31:27.681]  It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down and then are put on
[00:31:27.841 --> 00:31:28.561]  That's right.
[00:31:58.680 --> 00:32:05.886]  For all of recorded history, civilizations around the world praised the health benefits of silver.

[00:33:10.147 --> 00:33:13.735]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[00:33:13.735 --> 00:33:17.904]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:22.924 --> 00:33:24.286]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:24.286 --> 00:33:25.047]  I'm David Nyhan.
[00:33:25.047 --> 00:33:29.473]  On this April 20th, 2015, I'm joined in the studio with Jakari Jackson.
[00:33:29.473 --> 00:33:39.466]  And we were just talking in the last segment, Jakari, about how the public's opinion, their understanding of guns has completely reversed in the last couple of years.
[00:33:39.466 --> 00:33:40.147]  It really looked like
[00:33:40.627 --> 00:33:44.291]  We were going to lose everything, I think, in the wake of Sandy Hook.
[00:33:59.747 --> 00:34:11.917]  It was a very intense time, but I think it was a very necessary thing to do, because we see, not only with Sandy Hook, but after that, they continue to go after these firearms.
[00:34:11.917 --> 00:34:13.098]  They did sue Bushmaster.
[00:34:13.098 --> 00:34:13.618]  What else happened?
[00:34:16.941 --> 00:34:17.221]  I don't
[00:34:37.449 --> 00:34:39.973]  More than likely we'll probably not be involved in a mass shooting.
[00:34:39.973 --> 00:34:44.118]  I want to have a firearm to protect myself should somebody come and kick in my door at 3 in the morning.
[00:34:44.118 --> 00:34:46.341]  It doesn't have to be something super sensational.
[00:34:46.341 --> 00:34:51.007]  You're walking through a parking lot, somebody tries to shove you in a van, you pull out a firearm and shoot them.
[00:34:51.007 --> 00:34:51.768]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:34:51.768 --> 00:34:55.233]  Well, part of it is just explaining the common sense thing to people that look.
[00:34:56.358 --> 00:35:03.284]  If you've got one person with a gun, okay, or in the case of this shooting in Kenya, for example, they had four guys.
[00:35:03.284 --> 00:35:05.726]  They killed 150 people.
[00:35:05.726 --> 00:35:09.469]  They had, I forget how many hundreds they took, was it 600 or something like that?
[00:35:09.469 --> 00:35:10.510]  They took many people.
[00:35:10.510 --> 00:35:13.132]  Yeah, I mean, it was just incredibly crazy.
[00:35:13.132 --> 00:35:15.394]  But you know, when you've got only one person with a gun,
[00:35:15.894 --> 00:35:18.175]  And everybody else is disarmed, they're king!
[00:35:18.175 --> 00:35:21.636]  You know, and as long as they've got ammunition, they're, you know, they're in charge of it.
[00:35:21.636 --> 00:35:23.737]  So people understand, if you just point that out to them.
[00:35:23.737 --> 00:35:28.379]  Of course, the difference is, you never had the mainstream, and they never will, point that out.
[00:35:28.379 --> 00:35:33.701]  The mainstream media never would point that out to people before, and they never will, but we can have that discussion now.
[00:35:33.701 --> 00:35:35.982]  Such as the shooting, I believe it was in Oregon.
[00:35:36.582 --> 00:35:40.224]  Where somebody was running through and a man just pulled out his concealed carry.
[00:35:40.224 --> 00:35:41.644]  He didn't even fire it.
[00:35:41.644 --> 00:35:44.605]  He just pulled out his gun, aimed it at the guy, and the guy said, oh, I give up.
[00:35:44.605 --> 00:35:48.747]  And he ended up shooting himself, because I guess he didn't want to take the chance of being taken alive.
[00:35:48.747 --> 00:35:53.849]  But just simply introducing an opposition firearm can completely change the dynamic.
[00:35:53.849 --> 00:36:00.052]  And you notice, David, of all the mall shootings, the school shootings, that's the one that you rarely hear about, because they don't want to talk about that.
[00:36:00.052 --> 00:36:02.693]  The guy who pulled out a gun didn't even have to fire it.
[00:36:02.693 --> 00:36:05.014]  He just scared the guy enough to end the massacre.
[00:36:05.794 --> 00:36:11.919]  And I would go even farther, Jakari, because I think it is a key part when we talk about having this discussion about police officers.
[00:36:11.919 --> 00:36:13.040]  I think it's a key thing.
[00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:18.504]  You and I both went down to the open carry rally in San Antonio.
[00:36:18.504 --> 00:36:24.129]  There was a rally there because they had been harassing people who were legally open carrying long rifles.
[00:36:24.129 --> 00:36:25.430]  That's legal to do that.
[00:36:25.430 --> 00:36:27.652]  To give a little bit of background on that particular one.
[00:36:28.492 --> 00:36:29.933]  There's several things that led up to that.
[00:36:29.933 --> 00:36:31.113]  You know, of course, we have C.J.
[00:36:31.113 --> 00:36:34.074]  Grisham who was walking with his son out in the woods.
[00:36:34.074 --> 00:36:35.434]  You know, he had a gun.
[00:36:35.434 --> 00:36:36.554]  Cop pulls up, why do you have a gun?
[00:36:36.554 --> 00:36:40.356]  Like, wild hogs out here, you know, may get run over, you know, eventually get arrested.
[00:36:40.356 --> 00:36:41.836]  Completely bogus charge.
[00:36:41.836 --> 00:36:48.898]  And the thing you're talking about in San Antonio, a couple gentlemen were sitting outside, I believe it was a Starbucks or some type of similar restaurant.
[00:36:49.558 --> 00:36:53.600]  Open carrying their rifles, which is 100% legal here in the state of Texas.
[00:36:53.600 --> 00:36:56.821]  The officers decided to come over and harass the guys anyway.
[00:36:56.821 --> 00:36:58.382]  That leads us up to the Alamo.
[00:36:58.382 --> 00:36:59.902]  You know, a thousand plus people there.
[00:36:59.902 --> 00:37:02.003]  Lo and behold, nobody got shot.
[00:37:02.003 --> 00:37:03.564]  I mean, can you believe that, David?
[00:37:03.564 --> 00:37:05.005]  It was very orderly.
[00:37:05.005 --> 00:37:08.966]  And the interesting thing was that the police didn't harass anybody.
[00:37:08.966 --> 00:37:10.687]  Until it was over.
[00:37:10.687 --> 00:37:11.687]  Until it was over.
[00:37:11.687 --> 00:37:12.528]  That was the key thing.
[00:37:12.528 --> 00:37:14.649]  It was like the police just stayed back.
[00:37:14.649 --> 00:37:15.989]  They took pictures of everybody.
[00:37:15.989 --> 00:37:17.570]  They're watching us like a hawk and everything.
[00:37:17.990 --> 00:37:25.814]  But they left everybody alone until pretty much everybody went and then you and I saw there was a couple of guys left over and they went after them again.
[00:37:25.814 --> 00:37:32.919]  And so the point being is that for the citizens to be armed is not to make the world more dangerous.
[00:37:32.919 --> 00:37:36.360]  The citizens being armed is essentially a check to
[00:37:37.381 --> 00:37:45.327]  The police, who we see over and over again, are using excessive force against the population, who are harassing the population.
[00:37:45.327 --> 00:37:51.251]  And just the fact that you have firearms there, as one of the founders said, it restrains evil.
[00:37:51.251 --> 00:37:53.813]  The very presence of firearms restrains evil.
[00:37:53.813 --> 00:37:58.817]  So it gets the cops into a position where they're not in a bullying mode, okay?
[00:37:58.817 --> 00:38:00.418]  They basically respect the people.
[00:38:00.418 --> 00:38:02.900]  And again, we saw this at the Bundy Ranch standoff.
[00:38:03.100 --> 00:38:07.063]  There was only a couple of individuals down there on the ground who had guns.
[00:38:07.063 --> 00:38:08.864]  They had them holstered.
[00:38:08.864 --> 00:38:11.406]  Nobody was even aware of the one individual.
[00:38:11.406 --> 00:38:12.406]  That's the only thing they show.
[00:38:12.406 --> 00:38:14.868]  The one individual up on the bridge with the guns.
[00:38:14.868 --> 00:38:19.211]  But they had guns trained on us and they were shouting that they were going to shoot us.
[00:38:19.211 --> 00:38:21.833]  And yet the people just calmly walked up there.
[00:38:22.193 --> 00:38:25.376]  But it was a deterrence to know that there were people there that had arms.
[00:38:25.376 --> 00:38:26.877]  It was also a deterrence that the media was there.
[00:38:26.877 --> 00:38:30.400]  That's the point that we need to make, because people say, well, you guys are anti-police, you're anti-cop.
[00:38:30.400 --> 00:38:32.142]  We're not telling anybody to go out there and shoot people.
[00:38:32.142 --> 00:38:32.202]  No.
[00:38:32.202 --> 00:38:32.682]  No, we're not.
[00:38:32.682 --> 00:38:39.288]  We're just saying the simple fact that these people had firearms, you know, stopped the bullying procedures that were going on previous.
[00:38:39.288 --> 00:38:42.831]  They were tasing people, throwing people to the ground, and now they see somebody has
[00:38:43.291 --> 00:38:43.792]  A firearm.
[00:38:43.792 --> 00:38:45.195]  Okay, maybe it isn't that serious.
[00:38:45.195 --> 00:38:46.457]  I have to run up and tackle this guy.
[00:38:46.457 --> 00:38:48.801]  They started to think about it in a different way.
[00:38:48.801 --> 00:38:49.463]  Exactly.
[00:38:49.463 --> 00:38:49.983]  Exactly.
[00:38:49.983 --> 00:38:51.646]  Changes things all together.
[00:38:51.646 --> 00:38:52.067]  And we've got a...
[00:38:53.590 --> 00:38:58.054]  A report up on Infowars.com, a video where a cop shoots a dog in a crowded area.
[00:38:58.054 --> 00:39:04.139]  Let's run a little bit of this report, because this is what we have seen on virtually a daily basis.
[00:39:04.139 --> 00:39:10.084]  There are so many of these things out there that it is getting hard to not become jaded about this.
[00:39:10.084 --> 00:39:12.346]  Right, and it's not just this one particular incident.
[00:39:12.346 --> 00:39:16.130]  I believe Mikhail had a story last week about a police officer shooting a pig.
[00:39:19.472 --> 00:39:20.653]  Yeah.
[00:39:20.653 --> 00:39:31.282]  So it's going on a lot, and it's one of those things that if you shot at a dog or something, it'd be some big incident, you know, you'd probably get dragged into court and have to deal with all that kind of stuff.
[00:39:31.282 --> 00:39:43.752]  But when an officer does it, and the thing about this is, as the guys get ready to play this video, the officer misses the dog at point-blank range, the bullet ricochets, and luckily didn't hit anybody, but you have to think, had he
[00:39:45.353 --> 00:39:53.177]  Well, actually, there was a case similar to that.
[00:39:53.177 --> 00:40:04.142]  There was a lady and husband who were having arguments, and they put a restraining order on the lady, which meant that she had to have a police officer escort her back to get her things moved out.
[00:40:04.142 --> 00:40:11.306]  And as they were moving out, they got into an argument again, and the dog started barking and ran over, and so the cop pulled out a gun to shoot the dog.
[00:40:12.026 --> 00:40:18.189]  Missed the dog, and then lost his footing, and as he was falling over, he continued to shoot!
[00:40:18.189 --> 00:40:19.750]  I mean, where is the training on this?
[00:40:19.750 --> 00:40:21.690]  And shot the lady in the chest and killed her.
[00:40:21.690 --> 00:40:22.011]  Yes.
[00:40:22.011 --> 00:40:24.372]  So, I mean, yeah, that's not a hypothetical.
[00:40:24.372 --> 00:40:28.433]  We've had situations in New York where they were chasing somebody and just started shooting wildly in the crowd.
[00:40:28.433 --> 00:40:30.835]  I mean, there has to be some training.
[00:40:30.835 --> 00:40:36.137]  We can't have police with a shoot-first mentality and a Barney Fife outlook.
[00:40:36.317 --> 00:40:41.939]  Well, the thing about this, David, you think about mail carriers or other people, pizza men, who regularly encounter dogs.
[00:40:41.939 --> 00:40:43.780]  How often do they end up shooting the dog?
[00:40:43.780 --> 00:40:44.860]  You know, they're better trained.
[00:40:44.860 --> 00:40:51.943]  Lo and behold, a mailman with a can of pepper spray is better equipped to deal with a dog than a police officer with a pistol.
[00:40:51.943 --> 00:40:52.303]  Yeah.
[00:40:52.303 --> 00:40:53.944]  You know, what happened to all this pepper spray?
[00:40:53.944 --> 00:40:55.584]  They say they need it as a deterrent.
[00:40:55.584 --> 00:40:57.605]  They need the tasers as a deterrent.
[00:40:57.605 --> 00:41:02.767]  Why do they have to pull out a gun and shoot, especially in a crowded area as this... Let's run a little bit of this clip.
[00:41:02.767 --> 00:41:03.367]  ...incident.
[00:41:03.367 --> 00:41:04.828]  This is from Brooklyn, New York.
[00:41:06.067 --> 00:41:12.292]  It was a crowd of people gathered outside on Pacific Street watching the police activity and a lot of officers out there too.
[00:41:12.292 --> 00:41:18.657]  You can see the dog get loose and at one point he jumps up on a lieutenant and then it happens.
[00:41:18.657 --> 00:41:24.022]  One officer fires his gun at the dog from point-blank range but completely misses.
[00:41:24.022 --> 00:41:25.423]  The crowd was incensed.
[00:41:26.804 --> 00:41:27.565]  No!
[00:41:27.565 --> 00:41:28.886]  You're wrong!
[00:41:28.886 --> 00:41:31.028]  You're damn wrong for that!
[00:41:31.028 --> 00:41:35.972]  It didn't dawn on me it was a gun until the shot actually went past my foot in it.
[00:41:35.972 --> 00:41:41.637]  The spark hit the man behind me and then everything just really got crazy like, yo, you almost shot me.
[00:41:41.637 --> 00:41:42.437]  Are you serious?
[00:41:42.437 --> 00:41:43.438]  There's kids out here!
[00:41:46.340 --> 00:41:51.141]  You're going to open fire in a very crowded area.
[00:41:51.141 --> 00:41:52.461]  There are children out there.
[00:41:52.461 --> 00:42:00.183]  As I said earlier, had that bullet struck somebody, the dog owner would probably be on trial for having this dog run wild in the streets, not the officer.
[00:42:00.183 --> 00:42:02.663]  So what is the mindset of that officer when he pulls it out?
[00:42:02.663 --> 00:42:03.963]  He's not thinking about the crowd.
[00:42:03.963 --> 00:42:05.464]  He's not thinking about anybody else.
[00:42:05.464 --> 00:42:06.804]  He's simply afraid.
[00:42:06.804 --> 00:42:10.005]  And his first response is to use lethal force.
[00:42:10.005 --> 00:42:11.665]  And the thing is, that's the way they're being
[00:42:12.285 --> 00:42:13.087]  That's right.
[00:42:21.758 --> 00:42:29.303]  A guy who was an experienced teacher there said, we've got a new curriculum, I think it's a shoot first curriculum, and I refuse to teach it, they wouldn't change the curriculum.
[00:42:29.303 --> 00:42:30.224]  He resigned!
[00:42:30.224 --> 00:42:35.968]  So there has been a tremendous change in the way the police are being trained and the way we see this.
[00:42:35.968 --> 00:42:44.594]  But I think a key thing, again, going back to this Pew Report, looking at the actual data, they say Americans now believe that having a gun is the best way to protect against crime 63% to 30%.
[00:42:44.594 --> 00:42:45.715]  That's more than 2 to 1.
[00:42:45.715 --> 00:42:46.295]  Think that you're better
[00:42:49.117 --> 00:42:50.158]  Also, Sheriff Clark in Milwaukee
[00:43:17.040 --> 00:43:18.781]  He said that as well.
[00:43:18.781 --> 00:43:23.464]  Because the thing about it is, is the police, they come there, they don't necessarily know what the situation's going to be.
[00:43:23.464 --> 00:43:26.086]  So they get there, it's two guys swinging baseball bats at each other.
[00:43:26.086 --> 00:43:27.787]  One's a burglar, one's the homeowner.
[00:43:27.787 --> 00:43:28.928]  Know who's doing what.
[00:43:28.928 --> 00:43:37.374]  But, you know, if you have that equalizer being the firearm, you may, even if you don't have to shoot the guy, you can get him down on the ground so you need to surrender before, you know, this escalates any further.
[00:43:37.374 --> 00:43:37.754]  Exactly.
[00:43:38.294 --> 00:43:43.817]  Now, the public's change, as reflected in this Pew poll, is showing up in legislative issues.
[00:43:43.817 --> 00:43:52.821]  Now, in Texas, we've got a law that, now bringing you up to date on this, Jakari, I think, has it passed, or at what level is it?
[00:43:52.821 --> 00:43:54.702]  It hasn't been signed by the governor yet.
[00:43:56.602 --> 00:44:06.409]  It's running through the House of Representatives and it was voted on Friday 96 to 35 to allow residents with concealed handgun licenses to openly carry their guns in public.
[00:44:06.409 --> 00:44:21.560]  Now this is not the constitutional carry that they really wanted but you know it's a step in that direction and this article also goes on to point out that you know despite Texas being a having a pro-gun reputation, Texas is one of six states including California, New York and Florida
[00:44:22.120 --> 00:44:25.421]  They currently ban citizens from openly carrying their handguns.
[00:44:25.421 --> 00:44:31.742]  Now, to be very clear to people, I guess a lot of people don't understand that here in Texas you can openly carry a long gun.
[00:44:31.742 --> 00:44:40.784]  You can carry a rifle, a shotgun, slung over your hip, or some other way where you're not carrying in a manner calculated to cause alarm is the jargon they use.
[00:44:40.784 --> 00:44:48.706]  So, what they want to do, the gun advocates, and it looks like it's getting some steam behind it, is to carry a pistol on their hip like a police officer does.
[00:44:49.446 --> 00:44:53.350]  And a lot of people will make the debate, well, you know, it's shocking, it's this, it's that.
[00:44:53.350 --> 00:44:57.814]  Well, is it more shocking to see a guy walking down the street with an AK-47 strapped to his back?
[00:44:57.814 --> 00:45:02.918]  Which is still illegal and doesn't really bother me, but I understand some people have very strong opinions against it.
[00:45:02.918 --> 00:45:05.020]  Well, that's why part of it is a cultural thing.
[00:45:05.020 --> 00:45:07.142]  Part of it is getting people to understand that.
[00:45:07.142 --> 00:45:11.106]  And of course, we see that's happening now with the Pew poll.
[00:45:11.106 --> 00:45:14.569]  There's also in North Carolina, this is reported on New American today.
[00:45:15.089 --> 00:45:15.709]  And talk about that ATF.
[00:45:38.905 --> 00:45:41.047]  You know, a lot of people say, you know, what happens?
[00:45:41.047 --> 00:45:42.528]  Do you guys ever produce real change?
[00:45:42.528 --> 00:45:51.216]  And while I don't personally take credit for things, the ATF, this most recent thing, is a perfect example that people got informed about it, you know, whether it's from here or someplace else.
[00:45:51.216 --> 00:45:51.917]  They took action.
[00:45:51.917 --> 00:45:56.941]  They called and eventually backed off because enough people had the information and did something about it.
[00:45:56.941 --> 00:45:59.783]  And that's how you get real change to happen in your country.
[00:45:59.783 --> 00:46:00.144]  Absolutely.
[00:46:00.564 --> 00:46:04.686]  And the thing is, that's not something that is going to be coming out of CNN.
[00:46:04.686 --> 00:46:07.107]  It's not something that's going to be coming out of MSNBC.
[00:46:07.107 --> 00:46:09.968]  And it typically won't even be something coming out of Fox News.
[00:46:09.968 --> 00:46:14.570]  So yeah, we're not the only alternative media out there, the only authentic media.
[00:46:14.570 --> 00:46:21.974]  We are still telling people what's going on with this and explaining to them what the consequences are to this and what it really ought to look like.
[00:46:21.974 --> 00:46:25.855]  And I think we need to understand that it is really having an effect.
[00:46:25.855 --> 00:46:28.657]  In this particular case, they're pointing out that really
[00:46:29.617 --> 00:46:36.962]  The federal government doesn't have the right under the Constitution to force the states to do anything.
[00:46:36.962 --> 00:46:41.065]  And that's one of the things that North Carolina is responding to with this.
[00:46:41.065 --> 00:46:42.947]  But of course we're seeing that in a variety of areas.
[00:46:42.947 --> 00:46:48.411]  We're seeing that in bills that would deny utility services to the NSA.
[00:46:48.411 --> 00:46:53.675]  Because they understand that the NSA is coming in there and unconstitutionally doing dragnet searching and recording.
[00:46:54.495 --> 00:46:59.143]  People are pushing back, and in several states we've seen legislation brought up to do that.
[00:46:59.143 --> 00:47:05.673]  We also see, and of course this is 420, we see a lot of marijuana advocates.
[00:47:05.673 --> 00:47:07.496]  Yeah, they were downtown yesterday.
[00:47:08.683 --> 00:47:24.758]  But yeah, we see that same sort of thing happening with the legalization of marijuana, even for medical uses, because we have to understand that the federal government has marijuana as a Schedule 1 drug, which says that it doesn't have any medical uses whatsoever, which is clearly a lie.
[00:47:24.758 --> 00:47:31.144]  Everybody knows that's a lie, that's a fraud being perpetrated on the American public, and we all need to understand that where that law came from.
[00:47:31.684 --> 00:47:32.905]  Was the United Nations.
[00:47:32.905 --> 00:47:39.051]  Ten years before a war on drugs, they came out with exactly the blueprint, the agenda, just like Agenda 21.
[00:47:39.051 --> 00:47:48.219]  They came out with the entire legislative blueprint, had four different schedules for where you would put drugs, and where they wanted to put all of these different drugs in.
[00:47:48.219 --> 00:47:53.764]  So, that's why the UN is wringing its hands about legalized marijuana in different states.
[00:47:54.284 --> 00:47:58.888]  I don't want you to have something that you could use to potentially treat yourself growing in your backyard.
[00:47:58.888 --> 00:47:59.228]  That's right.
[00:47:59.228 --> 00:48:01.970]  Because it's hard for Big Pharma to get a cut out of that.
[00:48:01.970 --> 00:48:08.755]  I'm not telling anybody to go out and smoke to smoke, but I definitely recognize the medical benefits of just having marijuana.
[00:48:08.755 --> 00:48:09.816]  Yes, absolutely.
[00:48:09.816 --> 00:48:13.098]  Yeah, I don't use it recreationally, and I know you don't either, Jakari.
[00:48:14.429 --> 00:48:23.531]  I have always been upset for, you know, I should say, since the war on drugs started, since we saw things like mandatory minimums, like we saw civil asset forfeiture.
[00:48:23.531 --> 00:48:32.093]  That concerned me because I could see how they were using this to basically destroy our due process, to destroy the rule of law, to fill up the prisons.
[00:48:32.093 --> 00:48:36.894]  We now have 25% of the world's prison population is in America, even though we don't have anywhere close to that.
[00:48:36.894 --> 00:48:40.295]  And many of them non-violent offenders who are there under these mandatory minimums.
[00:48:40.455 --> 00:48:52.199]  So I look at this and I say, why am I having to be taxed to lock up nonviolent offenders for extraordinarily long periods of time, destroying their lives, destroying their families' lives?
[00:48:52.199 --> 00:48:53.559]  Why are we doing this?
[00:48:53.559 --> 00:48:55.239]  It absolutely makes no sense.
[00:48:55.239 --> 00:49:04.022]  And it's one of the things that I think we really need to speak to the conservatives about, because they're the ones who are dragging their feet, who are active in opposition.
[00:49:04.022 --> 00:49:09.684]  I think the thing that concerns me the most about it is seeing how the church believes
[00:49:10.564 --> 00:49:29.041]  The only way they can stop people from abusing drugs, and we need to understand there's a difference between use and abuse, but the only way that we can stop people from abusing drugs is by using the force of the state, and then completely hardening their heart to any testimony of anyone about how this drug is necessary in their life.
[00:49:29.041 --> 00:49:31.203]  That's the thing that that really disturbs
[00:49:31.283 --> 00:49:37.988]  And people say, well, you get high off marijuana, you get high off half the stuff, well, not half the stuff, the majority of the stuff you get at the drugstore.
[00:49:37.988 --> 00:49:43.011]  You know, you go to the pharmacist and they give you some, you know, Oxycontin or whatever, you can get high as a kite off of that.
[00:49:43.011 --> 00:49:44.673]  As a matter of fact, when they were talking about the
[00:49:45.703 --> 00:49:47.565]  The heroin epidemic.
[00:49:47.565 --> 00:49:53.710]  They were saying that there were far more deaths from prescription drug abuse than there were from heroin.
[00:49:53.710 --> 00:49:56.633]  And OxyContin was one of the key things on it.
[00:49:56.633 --> 00:50:00.376]  It's absolutely amazing to see how this is all playing out.
[00:50:00.376 --> 00:50:01.757]  But people are starting to wake up.
[00:50:01.757 --> 00:50:03.999]  And again, going back to what's happening at the states.
[00:50:03.999 --> 00:50:06.761]  I think that's really where we're going to see the changes.
[00:50:06.761 --> 00:50:10.164]  Where the states are asserting their legitimate sovereignty.
[00:50:11.165 --> 00:50:16.747]  And saying we're not going to allow the federal government to come in and do the things that it's been doing before.
[00:50:16.747 --> 00:50:20.688]  We're not going to just be a passive enabler of the federal government.
[00:50:20.688 --> 00:50:24.649]  You see it whether it's the BLM and the different land issues.
[00:50:24.649 --> 00:50:26.490]  You see it on marijuana.
[00:50:26.490 --> 00:50:28.210]  You see it on gun control.
[00:50:28.210 --> 00:50:29.631]  We're seeing this across the board.
[00:50:29.631 --> 00:50:32.312]  We're even seeing it on civil asset forfeiture.
[00:50:32.312 --> 00:50:33.872]  And that's a very important thing.
[00:50:33.872 --> 00:50:39.394]  If the government can take your property without ever convicting you of a crime, without even charging you of a crime,
[00:50:40.214 --> 00:50:43.740]  That destroys all of our basic property rights.
[00:50:43.740 --> 00:50:50.971]  That's exactly right, and I'm glad you mentioned that, because that's something that's very, uh, I don't want to say popular, but... Hang on, we're going to go to a commercial break.
[00:50:50.971 --> 00:50:51.853]  We're going to be right back.
[00:50:51.853 --> 00:50:53.255]  David Knight with Jakari Jackson.
[00:50:53.255 --> 00:50:53.636]  Stay with us.
[00:50:58.877 --> 00:51:08.181]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[00:51:08.181 --> 00:51:08.981]  This capitalism?
[00:51:08.981 --> 00:51:15.144]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[00:51:15.144 --> 00:51:18.826]  Ted Anderson, I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.
[00:51:18.826 --> 00:51:19.786]  Call for your copy 800-686-2237.
[00:51:19.786 --> 00:51:21.167]  It's time to understand the system.

[00:54:21.027 --> 00:54:22.508]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:54:22.508 --> 00:54:23.668]  I'm David Knight, your host.
[00:54:23.668 --> 00:54:27.650]  Joining me is Jakari Jackson and we have a story that is just broken.
[00:54:27.650 --> 00:54:29.411]  It's up on the Drudge Report.
[00:54:29.411 --> 00:54:36.253]  I'm going to show you a video that armed National Guard troops conduct exercise near a children's playground.
[00:54:36.253 --> 00:54:40.155]  This is a video that was sent to us by a citizen journalist.
[00:54:40.155 --> 00:54:43.036]  We've asked people to send us information about
[00:54:44.697 --> 00:54:49.744]  We're seeing military drills all over this country at an unprecedented level.
[00:54:49.744 --> 00:54:56.012]  And so we want people to send us that information to jadehelm at infowars.com and we'll put those videos up.
[00:54:56.012 --> 00:54:58.556]  We're going to talk about that video and show that in a moment.
[00:54:59.212 --> 00:55:03.054]  Before we do, I just want to let you know that right now you can go to InfoWars.com.
[00:55:03.054 --> 00:55:05.135]  Now is the time to start filtering your water.
[00:55:05.135 --> 00:55:13.000]  To help you do so, we're giving you 10% off all ProPure water filters with the promo code WATER right now at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:19.404]  And again, remember that if you can't get the government to ban the glyphosate or you can't get them to stop dumping
[00:55:20.004 --> 00:55:20.966]  We're good to go.
[00:55:38.608 --> 00:55:39.328]  We're good.
[00:56:08.374 --> 00:56:16.896]  We had a Texas representative here, David Simpson, who twice offered a bill to stop that because he said it is sexual abuse of children and adults.
[00:56:16.896 --> 00:56:29.499]  What the TSA is doing came very close to passing, but of course the governor and the lieutenant governor got that shot down in the Senate, and the federal government threatened to turn Texas into a no-fly zone.
[00:56:29.499 --> 00:56:29.859]  Nevertheless,
[00:56:30.519 --> 00:56:44.444]  My point being is that Drudge has been very good in terms of pointing out these over-the-top actions that the federal government is doing, and one of these is the increase in the military training that we're seeing throughout America.
[00:56:44.444 --> 00:56:48.925]  And of course, understand that the military has bases all over America.
[00:56:49.045 --> 00:56:51.526]  They have large bases where they can do these drills.
[00:56:51.526 --> 00:56:52.526]  Inside of the base?
[00:56:52.526 --> 00:56:53.307]  Inside of the base.
[00:56:53.307 --> 00:56:55.147]  That's why they're military bases.
[00:56:55.147 --> 00:56:58.809]  And of course we have military bases in all these other countries, too.
[00:56:58.809 --> 00:57:00.129]  In places where they're fighting wars.
[00:57:00.129 --> 00:57:03.691]  I mean, there's not any shortage of places where they could train.
[00:57:03.691 --> 00:57:09.453]  When they get out of the bases, when they're getting into the streets, as we see in this particular footage,
[00:57:09.933 --> 00:57:13.154]  There's a different agenda going on here other than just training.
[00:57:13.154 --> 00:57:23.796]  They're training the troops to do operations in continental USA, and they're training the American public to get used to living in a banana republic.
[00:57:23.796 --> 00:57:38.080]  I remember traveling to other countries 20, 30 years ago where I would see the police walking around in military gear with full assault weapons, fully automatic weapons, and that would strike you.
[00:57:38.920 --> 00:57:41.701]  But of course, it didn't make any difference to the people that were there.
[00:57:41.701 --> 00:57:42.341]  They were accustomed.
[00:57:42.341 --> 00:57:43.022]  They were used to it.
[00:57:43.022 --> 00:57:44.522]  They were used to seeing that.
[00:57:44.522 --> 00:57:46.703]  And so, it's what you get used to seeing.
[00:57:46.703 --> 00:57:52.125]  So they're accustoming us to living in a militarized police state.
[00:57:52.125 --> 00:57:54.065]  A banana republic with nuclear weapons.
[00:57:54.065 --> 00:57:55.866]  Let's take a look at this video right here.
[00:57:55.866 --> 00:57:57.407]  This is an article up right now.
[00:57:57.407 --> 00:58:01.608]  Armed National Guard troops conduct exercise near a children's playground.
[00:58:01.608 --> 00:58:03.929]  Let's run a little bit of this and we'll describe it for the radio audience.
[00:58:07.111 --> 00:58:10.692]  Okay, this is in Stanton, Virginia.
[00:58:10.692 --> 00:58:14.673]  And, uh, this individual is driving in the car.
[00:58:14.673 --> 00:58:17.113]  Pulling up, you can see the troops there.
[00:58:17.113 --> 00:58:18.054]  Several troops.
[00:58:18.054 --> 00:58:28.276]  Yeah.
[00:58:28.276 --> 00:58:32.177]  They're marching right at the edge of a, uh, looks like a park here.
[00:58:33.715 --> 00:58:36.100]  Look, even more troops, they keep coming in.
[00:58:36.100 --> 00:58:37.783]  They also have guns.
[00:58:37.783 --> 00:58:38.945]  Yeah.
[00:58:38.945 --> 00:58:40.488]  Alright, we'll be right back.
[00:58:40.488 --> 00:58:41.730]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[00:58:49.065 --> 00:58:50.146]  Hi, I'm Alex Jones.
[00:58:50.146 --> 00:58:54.409]  When I got on air 20 years ago, I weighed 180 pounds.
[00:58:54.409 --> 00:58:56.510]  I lift weights five days a week.
[00:58:56.510 --> 00:58:58.171]  I can swim two, three miles.
[00:58:58.171 --> 00:59:01.333]  Then I discovered the New World Order, the globalists, their agenda.
[00:59:01.333 --> 00:59:03.314]  I started an access television show.
[00:59:03.314 --> 00:59:08.698]  I was so dedicated to my work and hanging around with radio guys that I began drinking.
[00:59:08.698 --> 00:59:11.540]  I began smoking cigars and then even cigarettes.
[00:59:12.060 --> 00:59:18.144]  I transformed from looking like a white Bruce Lee to looking like a job of the hut.
[00:59:18.144 --> 00:59:23.387]  So I began a journey five years ago to shed the almost 100 pounds.
[00:59:23.387 --> 00:59:28.270]  I started taking super male vitality and saw dramatic results in just a few weeks.
[00:59:28.550 --> 00:59:35.952]  When I added to the mix the key products developed by Dr. Groot for Infowarslife.com, the results were incredible.

[01:00:06.214 --> 01:00:07.976]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:07.976 --> 01:00:09.739]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:09.739 --> 01:00:11.321]  You want answers?

[01:00:17.070 --> 01:00:21.115]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:24.215 --> 01:00:25.576]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:25.576 --> 01:00:27.038]  This is Monday, April 20th, 2015.
[01:00:27.038 --> 01:00:30.441]  I'm David Knight, your host today, and joining me right now is Jakari Jackson.
[01:00:30.441 --> 01:00:33.104]  And we were just looking at the footage.
[01:00:33.104 --> 01:00:35.286]  This is a new article that went up on Infowars.com.
[01:00:35.286 --> 01:00:37.348]  It's been picked up by the Drudge Report.
[01:00:37.348 --> 01:00:42.153]  Armed National Guard troops conduct exercise near a children's playground.
[01:00:42.153 --> 01:00:42.633]  There you go.
[01:00:42.633 --> 01:00:44.635]  Right next to a public park.
[01:00:44.635 --> 01:00:45.536]  And we had a
[01:00:46.417 --> 01:00:56.241]  Listener, send this in to us, and we were just looking at this, we could see the people walking next to the park, fully armed, a large number of... A very large crowd.
[01:00:56.241 --> 01:00:56.721]  Yeah.
[01:00:56.721 --> 01:00:57.982]  Let's go back to that clip.
[01:00:57.982 --> 01:01:01.343]  I wanted to see what was happening beyond that.
[01:01:01.343 --> 01:01:11.528]  Of course, as we go to that clip, it was last week, as Watson points out in the article, that in Ontario, California, there were National Guard troops that were marching down a residential street
[01:01:12.248 --> 01:01:27.932]  While chanting military cadence and performing traffic control drills, this is all an effort to get the troops accustomed to operating in America, as well as getting the American citizens accustomed to living in a militarized police state.
[01:01:28.112 --> 01:01:29.273]  Make no doubt about it.
[01:01:29.273 --> 01:01:33.836]  It was about a year ago that Joe Biggs and I went through AP Hill.
[01:01:33.836 --> 01:01:47.484]  And again, in that fort, within that, there was another area that had a separate area that was walled in and fenced in to train troops, to train police, to act as military in American cities.
[01:01:47.484 --> 01:01:49.626]  It was a replica of an American city.
[01:01:49.626 --> 01:01:54.209]  And when you say American city, there are signs in English, there's a subway system.
[01:01:54.209 --> 01:01:56.190]  We stood at the corner of 1st and Main.
[01:01:56.630 --> 01:01:56.990]  Yeah.
[01:01:56.990 --> 01:01:57.350]  Okay.
[01:01:57.350 --> 01:02:01.192]  And there were traffic lights that were operating as we were standing there.
[01:02:01.192 --> 01:02:09.976]  And I mean, it was like being in one of these end-of-the-world movies, you know, where everybody has died and it's a vacant city.
[01:02:09.976 --> 01:02:11.737]  It was pretty, pretty eerie.
[01:02:11.737 --> 01:02:12.778]  And that's what they're training for.
[01:02:12.778 --> 01:02:17.160]  They've been training for these scenarios in these separate areas within forts.
[01:02:17.900 --> 01:02:20.202]  No, for Alex Jones, it's not real big for him.
[01:02:46.141 --> 01:02:47.862]  You'll be on his channel this week.
[01:02:47.862 --> 01:02:48.903]  That's right.
[01:02:48.903 --> 01:02:51.705]  Guarantee you.
[01:02:51.705 --> 01:02:56.529]  The guy who's saying that, if you didn't hear that, he says... InfoWars.com.
[01:02:56.529 --> 01:02:57.890]  InfoWars, okay.
[01:02:57.890 --> 01:02:58.951]  Cool.
[01:02:58.951 --> 01:03:01.533]  Thank you.
[01:03:01.533 --> 01:03:03.575]  Which regiment are you guys with?
[01:03:03.575 --> 01:03:04.735]  Who are you with?
[01:03:04.735 --> 01:03:04.836]  116th.
[01:03:04.836 --> 01:03:06.077]  Okay.
[01:03:06.077 --> 01:03:07.177]  U.S.
[01:03:07.177 --> 01:03:08.378]  Army?
[01:03:08.378 --> 01:03:09.279]  National Guard, sir.
[01:03:09.279 --> 01:03:10.160]  National Guard, okay.
[01:03:11.383 --> 01:03:17.407]  So he's taking pictures of them and he tells them, smile for Alex Jones, you're going to be on, I guarantee you.
[01:03:17.407 --> 01:03:18.308]  And they said, what website?
[01:03:18.308 --> 01:03:19.288]  And he says, Infowars.com.
[01:03:19.288 --> 01:03:22.350]  Of course, they'll have to look at that on their own computers because they want that.
[01:03:22.350 --> 01:03:23.831]  Because it's banned in a lot of military bases.
[01:03:23.831 --> 01:03:26.153]  Yeah, they ban it, the military, the Department of Defense.
[01:03:26.613 --> 01:03:27.854]  Look at these drills, David.
[01:03:27.854 --> 01:03:32.558]  You train in a terrain that you're planning to deploy to, you're planning to be active to.
[01:03:32.558 --> 01:03:33.058]  Yes.
[01:03:33.058 --> 01:03:43.687]  So when we see these drills, you know, whether it's there, whether we see the drills in Miami, Florida, whether we see the drills in downtown San Diego, California, what cave in Afghanistan looks like Miami, Florida?
[01:03:43.687 --> 01:03:43.867]  Yeah.
[01:03:43.867 --> 01:03:45.448]  You know, what do these guys train?
[01:03:45.448 --> 01:03:48.831]  And that's the question that we keep asking that nobody really wants to answer.
[01:03:48.831 --> 01:03:49.491]  Well, they're just training.
[01:03:49.491 --> 01:03:54.175]  They're training for what foreign desert looks like San Diego, California?
[01:03:54.435 --> 01:04:05.063]  And as you see, what they did in Florida, this most recent one, which just happened a couple of weeks ago, they're going in to extract people who are enemies of the state.
[01:04:05.063 --> 01:04:09.566]  Okay, they have civilians marching in lines, they put them in white vans, they drive them off.
[01:04:09.566 --> 01:04:13.109]  That's what they've been saying that they're doing in their training scenarios.
[01:04:13.109 --> 01:04:13.789]  And I have to say,
[01:04:14.950 --> 01:04:25.115]  When they had massive exercises right at the border of Russia and you had a reporter talking to Putin and he says, you know, why do they have troops training here?
[01:04:25.115 --> 01:04:26.495]  And he goes, well, those aren't directed to you.
[01:04:26.495 --> 01:04:28.296]  They're just a training exercise.
[01:04:28.296 --> 01:04:31.418]  And he laughed at the guy for about 15 seconds.
[01:04:31.418 --> 01:04:32.538]  It's absurd.
[01:04:32.538 --> 01:04:33.899]  It is a laughable notion.
[01:04:34.119 --> 01:04:37.342]  As you pointed out, Jakari, they train as they're going to fight.
[01:04:37.342 --> 01:04:40.925]  They train where they're going to fight, and the means that they're going to fight, and that's what we can see.
[01:04:40.925 --> 01:04:42.466]  It matches their scenario.
[01:04:42.466 --> 01:04:46.230]  How many more times do we have to connect the dots for people?
[01:04:46.230 --> 01:04:46.610]  I don't know.
[01:04:46.610 --> 01:04:47.891]  Thanks for joining us, Jakari.
[01:04:47.891 --> 01:04:48.492]  Thank you, Dave.
[01:04:48.492 --> 01:04:48.812]  Stay with us.
[01:04:48.812 --> 01:04:50.974]  We're going to be right back with some more breaking news.
[01:04:59.069 --> 01:05:05.194]  I was born on the prairies where the wind blew free, and there was nothing to break the light of the sun.
[01:05:05.194 --> 01:05:08.077]  I was born where there were no enclosures.
[01:05:08.077 --> 01:05:09.278]  Geronimo.
[01:05:09.278 --> 01:05:21.948]  I wonder what he thinks of the permanent checkpoints, where you're quizzed about your citizenship, about having to submit to bag searches to ride public transportation, his thoughts on non-violent offenders riding away in prisons.
[01:05:21.948 --> 01:05:25.671]  They say that in these current times we are more, quote, civilized,
[01:05:25.891 --> 01:05:28.394]  But are we really more free?
[01:05:28.394 --> 01:05:43.395]  When the Persian army demanded King Leonidas and his Spartans surrender their arms, the outnumbered king shouted, Even though Leonidas was eventually defeated by a much larger adversary, he is not remembered for his loss.
[01:05:43.775 --> 01:05:47.740]  He lives in history as a beacon of defiance and self-defense.
[01:05:47.740 --> 01:05:51.204]  The desire to disarm the people is nothing new.
[01:05:51.204 --> 01:05:58.211]  Arm yourself with knowledge at InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv, and the Alex Jones Channel on YouTube.
[01:05:58.772 --> 01:05:59.513]  We're good to go.
[01:06:28.496 --> 01:06:29.496]  Alex Jones here.
[01:06:29.496 --> 01:06:38.780]  For the last two years, I've been working with top doctors, nutritionists, and chemists to design a nutraceutical formulation that has truly life-changing health benefits.
[01:06:38.780 --> 01:06:42.601]  Introducing the all-new Ancient Defense Herbal Immunity Blend.
[01:06:42.601 --> 01:06:50.924]  Experience the benefits of combining over 14 ancient herbs and extracts with exciting new advances in nutraceutical science.
[01:06:50.924 --> 01:06:53.224]  Visit Infowarslife.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[01:06:53.224 --> 01:06:54.265]  That's Infowarslife.com.
[01:07:01.469 --> 01:07:11.211]  And it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and help children focus.
[01:07:11.211 --> 01:07:13.912]  All of our children are hit with modern mind control.
[01:07:13.912 --> 01:07:17.472]  Television, music, fast food, GMOs, sugars, you name it.
[01:07:17.472 --> 01:07:23.794]  Young humans have not yet developed their nervous system and are being hammered daily by globalist concoctions.
[01:07:23.794 --> 01:07:28.615]  It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down and then are put on dangerous psychotropic drugs.
[01:07:28.915 --> 01:07:35.297]  Working with my team, we set out to find the best formula with the highest quality ingredients that children would actually like and take.
[01:07:35.297 --> 01:07:43.039]  We worked with the leading manufacturer in nutritional supplements that are safe for children to bring you the most affordable and powerful calming formula out there.
[01:07:43.039 --> 01:07:50.582]  Introducing ChildEase with herbs and calming extracts like chamomile and lemon balm and essential nutrients that taste great.
[01:07:50.582 --> 01:07:54.183]  Obtain your ChildEase today at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:07:54.183 --> 01:07:57.144]  That's ChildEase exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:08:01.283 --> 01:08:03.505]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:08:03.505 --> 01:08:06.867]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:12.338 --> 01:08:15.299]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show on this Monday, April 20th, 2015.
[01:08:15.299 --> 01:08:16.359]  I'm David Knight.
[01:08:16.359 --> 01:08:20.400]  We'll be joined by Leanne McAdoo at the bottom of the hour.
[01:08:20.400 --> 01:08:22.661]  I wanted to go back to the fast track.
[01:08:22.661 --> 01:08:35.404]  And again, as I pointed out in the last hour, last week on Wednesday, we had an agreement between Republicans and Democrats in the Senate and in the House to fast track.
[01:08:35.404 --> 01:08:36.124]  Fast track.
[01:08:37.273 --> 01:08:48.096]  I know that sounds confusing, but what they're going to do is they're going to take this fast-tracked authority, which allows them to negotiate this in secret with corporate lobbyists, as they've been doing now for several years.
[01:08:48.096 --> 01:08:51.236]  They're about to run this up for a vote.
[01:08:51.236 --> 01:08:55.077]  It's just going to be a mere formality, because we know this is going to go through.
[01:08:55.077 --> 01:08:58.278]  There's not going to be any opportunity for the public to take a look at this.
[01:08:58.738 --> 01:09:03.501]  There will be no amendments allowed in this fast-track procedure.
[01:09:03.501 --> 01:09:05.282]  It's going to be kind of a straight up and down.
[01:09:05.282 --> 01:09:09.125]  And of course, this is something, as I point out, that is bipartisan.
[01:09:09.125 --> 01:09:13.227]  NAFTA was run through by Clinton and by Bush.
[01:09:13.227 --> 01:09:15.609]  Both of them would have passed the NAFTA.
[01:09:16.591 --> 01:09:24.257]  And both parties, the leadership of both parties are solidly behind this secret corporate trade agreement.
[01:09:24.257 --> 01:09:25.658]  It's not good economic policy.
[01:09:25.658 --> 01:09:28.180]  I don't believe it is not free trade by any means.
[01:09:28.180 --> 01:09:36.407]  It is no more free trade than the corporate bailout of the banks was a free market exercise.
[01:09:36.407 --> 01:09:38.409]  No, it is crony capitalism.
[01:09:38.409 --> 01:09:42.612]  It is ruled by the very largest corporations on the planet.
[01:09:44.233 --> 01:09:49.135]  A stepping stone to global governance by these multinational corporations.
[01:09:49.135 --> 01:09:51.336]  And I want to play for you what Obama just said.
[01:09:51.336 --> 01:09:55.878]  Because it is essentially a fight that is going on within the Democrat Party.
[01:09:55.878 --> 01:09:59.500]  The Republicans seem to be pretty much solidly behind it.
[01:09:59.500 --> 01:10:04.622]  But the Democrats are still having a problem with this.
[01:10:04.622 --> 01:10:08.064]  But here's what Obama said to assure people about this process.
[01:10:10.040 --> 01:10:25.345]  It is entirely understandable that there is some skepticism around trade from working families who live in a town that saw manufacturing collapse and jobs being outsourced.
[01:10:25.345 --> 01:10:34.907]  People recognize that there have been circumstances in the past in which trade may have contributed to aggregate growth of the global economy or even the U.S.
[01:10:34.907 --> 01:10:36.728]  economy, but hurt workers.
[01:10:37.842 --> 01:10:39.182]  Okay, let's stop it right there.
[01:10:39.182 --> 01:10:42.563]  That's essentially the position of many in the Democrat Party.
[01:10:42.563 --> 01:10:45.884]  And understand that it is not just about a loss of jobs.
[01:10:45.884 --> 01:10:49.585]  It's not just about a loss of high-paying jobs.
[01:10:49.585 --> 01:10:53.526]  We've seen, we were told by Clinton, that we're going to get 200,000 new jobs in America
[01:10:56.227 --> 01:10:57.367]  After NAFTA passed?
[01:10:57.367 --> 01:10:58.168]  Within two years.
[01:10:58.168 --> 01:11:07.410]  What we've seen, on the other hand, is 700,000 jobs lost, 61% of those high-paying manufacturing jobs that have gone to other countries.
[01:11:07.410 --> 01:11:09.030]  So it hasn't really worked out too well.
[01:11:09.030 --> 01:11:13.972]  Not on the income side, not on the job side, and not on the wealth side.
[01:11:13.972 --> 01:11:18.573]  You need to understand that not only are we losing our income, but we are losing our wealth.
[01:11:19.349 --> 01:11:21.573]  We're losing what we had in this country.
[01:11:21.573 --> 01:11:24.257]  We are going into debt at a rapid rate.
[01:11:24.257 --> 01:11:26.621]  If you go back and you look at the trade deficits that we had...
[01:11:27.310 --> 01:11:35.271]  Immediately after NAFTA passed, we had the largest trade deficit we'd ever had of $130 billion.
[01:11:35.271 --> 01:11:39.932]  And we have never had a smaller trade deficit than that since it passed.
[01:11:39.932 --> 01:11:44.373]  In the last 14 years, we have had 14 record years of trade deficit.
[01:11:44.373 --> 01:11:46.353]  So it's been devastating economically.
[01:11:46.353 --> 01:11:47.894]  It's devastated our jobs.
[01:11:47.894 --> 01:11:49.214]  It's devastated our income.
[01:11:49.214 --> 01:11:50.334]  It's devastated our wealth.
[01:11:50.334 --> 01:11:56.055]  It's made us indebted to other countries, predominantly, though, to banks.
[01:11:56.815 --> 01:12:00.599]  But it also has a sovereignty issue side to it.
[01:12:00.599 --> 01:12:07.326]  Let's play this clip from Senator Brown, who was one of the Democrats complaining about the fact that this is being done in secret.
[01:12:07.326 --> 01:12:13.113]  And this was in the discussions leading up to passing the, to fast-tracking the whole fast-track process last week.
[01:12:14.449 --> 01:12:18.173]  My question is this, to the Ambassador.
[01:12:18.173 --> 01:12:29.564]  I can't speak for everyone else on this committee, but from my own experience, USTR's consultations with Congress have been, I hesitate to use this adverb, but I will, pathetically inadequate.
[01:12:29.764 --> 01:12:30.064]  That's the U.S.
[01:12:30.064 --> 01:12:30.925]  Trade Representative he's talking about.
[01:12:30.925 --> 01:12:34.926]  We asked for data showing the utilization rate of the Korean FTA.
[01:12:34.926 --> 01:12:38.388]  Since it's gone into effect, we've got nothing from USTR.
[01:12:38.388 --> 01:12:43.470]  We asked for information used to justify the auto rules of origin proposal the U.S.
[01:12:43.470 --> 01:12:45.351]  tabled in TPP.
[01:12:45.351 --> 01:12:47.792]  USTR gave us nothing.
[01:12:47.792 --> 01:12:55.835]  I might add that's where you're able to say, or maybe you aren't, that you actually did renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement.
[01:12:56.315 --> 01:12:58.056]  Okay, so that's getting pretty technical.
[01:12:58.056 --> 01:13:05.900]  Let's just suffice to say, do you get the idea that he's asking the USTR, the US Trade Representative, for information and the US Trade Representative is basically stonewalling him on it?
[01:13:05.900 --> 01:13:07.941]  In other words, they're not getting any information.
[01:13:26.192 --> 01:13:27.853]  Now, what passed last Wednesday?
[01:13:27.853 --> 01:13:37.439]  They say it would give Congress the power to vote on this deal, and just the Trans-Pacific Partnership alone is going to have 12 nations that are going to be involved in it.
[01:13:37.439 --> 01:13:40.461]  It's about 40% of the world's trade.
[01:13:40.461 --> 01:13:54.551]  They say once it's completed, it would deny lawmakers a chance to amend what would be the largest trade deal since NAFTA in 1994, which Bill Clinton pushed through Congress, despite opposition from Labor and other Democrat constituencies.
[01:13:55.211 --> 01:13:56.793]  See, that's just it.
[01:13:56.793 --> 01:13:59.997]  It wasn't that somehow this went wrong.
[01:13:59.997 --> 01:14:03.040]  It wasn't that somehow this was going to be a good deal for us and create jobs.
[01:14:03.040 --> 01:14:06.123]  They knew from the beginning that it wasn't going to do that.
[01:14:06.123 --> 01:14:06.884]  They lied to us.
[01:14:08.829 --> 01:14:14.712]  NAFTA did exactly what the bankers and the multinational corporations wanted it to do.
[01:14:14.712 --> 01:14:22.636]  It provided them with cheap labor, it exported manufacturing from our area, just as Ross Perot said, that giant sucking sound.
[01:14:22.636 --> 01:14:26.438]  We need to understand that it did precisely what it was intended to do.
[01:14:26.438 --> 01:14:29.100]  So many times we look at schools that are failing and we think,
[01:14:29.500 --> 01:14:30.601]  You know, it's just not working.
[01:14:30.601 --> 01:14:31.402]  The border is open.
[01:14:31.402 --> 01:14:33.704]  I just don't... Why can't government get it right?
[01:14:33.704 --> 01:14:39.630]  You have to understand, the schools and the borders are doing exactly what they wanted them to do.
[01:14:39.630 --> 01:14:42.032]  They just lied to you about the purpose.
[01:14:42.032 --> 01:14:44.534]  They are doing precisely what they were designed to do.
[01:14:44.534 --> 01:14:46.857]  And NAFTA did precisely what it was designed to do.
[01:14:46.857 --> 01:14:50.300]  Remember, it was Petraeus that said just a few months ago, what comes after North America?
[01:14:51.116 --> 01:14:51.316]  I think?
[01:15:08.937 --> 01:15:12.959]  This implementation being a failure of NAFTA economically.
[01:15:12.959 --> 01:15:16.940]  We need to understand that it is coming after our sovereignty.
[01:15:16.940 --> 01:15:18.101]  Okay?
[01:15:18.101 --> 01:15:20.702]  That is the key thing that we need to understand.
[01:15:20.702 --> 01:15:22.523]  Now, there are people who are protesting it.
[01:15:22.523 --> 01:15:24.463]  We got worldwide protests.
[01:15:24.463 --> 01:15:31.826]  There's a lot of people in Germany that they had a global day of action that's planned primarily in Europe and in the US.
[01:15:34.238 --> 01:15:36.721]  I don't know that there's that many people in the U.S.
[01:15:36.721 --> 01:15:39.564]  that are turning out to protest this, though.
[01:15:39.564 --> 01:15:43.408]  Most people think that free trade is a good thing, and free trade is a good thing.
[01:15:43.408 --> 01:15:44.329]  This isn't free trade.
[01:15:44.329 --> 01:15:48.213]  This is no more free trade than the Patriot Act is patriotic.
[01:15:48.213 --> 01:15:49.574]  You understand?
[01:15:49.574 --> 01:15:55.580]  When they give these names, they give them the name of exactly the opposite of what they are.
[01:15:56.476 --> 01:15:59.799]  Because they understand that this is managed trade, so they call it free trade.
[01:15:59.799 --> 01:16:03.423]  They understand the Patriot Act was absolute tyranny.
[01:16:03.423 --> 01:16:05.745]  That's why they gave it that acronym.
[01:16:05.745 --> 01:16:16.415]  So there are thousands of people that are showing up in Germany and elsewhere, but in America, in America, we seem to not really understand the real gist of this.
[01:16:17.355 --> 01:16:23.817]  And again, we need to understand that this is about sovereignty as much as it is about creating an economic collapse.
[01:16:23.817 --> 01:16:32.400]  This explains, I believe, not only why we have open borders, but why we see the military training everywhere, just as Jakari Jackson and I were talking about in the last segment.
[01:16:32.400 --> 01:16:36.341]  This article that's up on Infowars.com, linked at the Drudge Report.
[01:16:36.861 --> 01:16:37.602]  We're good to go.
[01:16:55.811 --> 01:16:58.954]  Why are we seeing all of these military drills?
[01:16:58.954 --> 01:17:01.416]  Why are they training for this in their scenarios?
[01:17:01.416 --> 01:17:05.959]  Why do they have bases within military bases where they train to operate in cities?
[01:17:05.959 --> 01:17:08.441]  They know that something is coming.
[01:17:08.441 --> 01:17:14.546]  They know that we're going to have an economics collapse or we're going to have something else happen in this country.
[01:17:14.546 --> 01:17:19.611]  Very well could be an economic collapse brought on by these types of trade agreements.
[01:17:20.231 --> 01:17:23.772]  Look at how it has devastated our country after NAFTA.
[01:17:23.772 --> 01:17:31.655]  Imagine what's going to happen when we then make a more comprehensive trade agreement with China, for example.
[01:17:31.655 --> 01:17:39.297]  And of course, the way they're selling it to us is by saying, well, right now China is writing all the rules, and I think America needs to write the rules.
[01:17:39.297 --> 01:17:42.498]  That's why we've got the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
[01:17:42.498 --> 01:17:45.399]  That's actually what the administration is saying.
[01:17:45.399 --> 01:17:48.260]  In the first place, why are we allowing China to write the rules?
[01:17:49.378 --> 01:17:55.300]  And if we're allowing China to write the rules, don't you think China might be writing the TPP along with the multinational corporations?
[01:17:55.300 --> 01:17:57.381]  Nothing is going to change on that.
[01:17:57.381 --> 01:18:01.703]  We could assert our authority, but of course we're not.
[01:18:01.703 --> 01:18:03.624]  The American people aren't, and Congress isn't.
[01:18:04.380 --> 01:18:09.423]  When I look at what they're doing, they're essentially turning over the governance already.
[01:18:09.423 --> 01:18:10.984]  It's already a sovereignty issue.
[01:18:10.984 --> 01:18:17.149]  Already they're turning everything that they should be doing over to corporate lobbyists who are writing this in secret.
[01:18:17.149 --> 01:18:20.291]  In the same way that they have turned over power to the bureaucracies.
[01:18:20.291 --> 01:18:30.017]  You know, when we look at the situation that is out in the gold mine in Oregon right now, just as we saw the situation at the Bundy Ranch in Nevada.
[01:18:30.017 --> 01:18:33.800]  We have bureaucracies like the BLM writing their own regulations.
[01:18:34.820 --> 01:18:39.943]  Finding you policing it and finding you guilty of those regulations in their own courts.
[01:18:39.943 --> 01:18:43.205]  They have become their own little empires, their own little governments.
[01:18:43.205 --> 01:18:46.046]  And now we're allowing the corporations to do that.
[01:18:46.046 --> 01:19:00.754]  And of course, one of the reasons that the BLM is going in and confiscating property rights, like grazing rights, like mining rights, that have been in private hands for 150 years, going back into the mid-1800s, the reason they're doing that
[01:19:01.474 --> 01:19:07.481]  It's because they're going to turn that over to a corporation once they get enough of these people out.
[01:19:07.481 --> 01:19:09.944]  It's the same thing we see at the local level all the time.
[01:19:09.944 --> 01:19:12.687]  Alex talked about how he saw this here in Texas.
[01:19:12.687 --> 01:19:21.438]  He got involved helping small property owners who were having the property confiscated because the city government was coming in and assessing huge fines on them.
[01:19:21.878 --> 01:19:24.601]  So much so that they couldn't pay them, so the city took their property.
[01:19:24.601 --> 01:19:32.690]  Once they took enough property from enough small, poor homeowners, they condemned the rest, turned it over to their buddies who built skyscrapers.
[01:19:32.690 --> 01:19:36.174]  I saw the same thing happening in Tampa, where I grew up.
[01:19:36.174 --> 01:19:39.277]  We called the mayor there, Sandy Friedman, Sandlot Friedman.
[01:19:39.277 --> 01:19:43.522]  She was going in and pushing low-income people out of the homes that they had owned.
[01:19:44.062 --> 01:19:48.143]  And then turning it over to large corporations that put skyscrapers on it.
[01:19:48.143 --> 01:19:49.684]  That's what this is all about.
[01:19:49.684 --> 01:19:51.864]  That's what the Keystone Pipeline is about.
[01:19:51.864 --> 01:19:55.925]  That's what this Trans-Pacific Partnership and Transatlantic Partnership is about.
[01:19:55.925 --> 01:19:59.186]  And it's about a loss of sovereignty, not just taking us down economically.
[01:19:59.186 --> 01:20:05.668]  Why now you know that wireless technology, like cell phones, do in fact pose dangers to the health and privacy of everyone?
[01:20:05.888 --> 01:20:10.912]  Block It Pocket's wide range of products are unmatched in providing the protection you deserve.

[01:20:28.365 --> 01:20:30.826]  So the news breaks, Hillary Clinton's running for president.
[01:20:30.826 --> 01:20:35.788]  My buddy Mark says to me, hey, didn't Hillary support the Brady Bill and the assault weapons ban?
[01:20:35.788 --> 01:20:42.311]  And I'm thinking, yeah, 1992, presidential campaign, oh my god, a gun grabber in the White House.
[01:20:42.311 --> 01:20:45.753]  So at Guns80.com, they've come up with a Hillary Clinton special.

[01:22:27.472 --> 01:22:30.354]  My name is Del and I live in El Cajon, California.
[01:22:30.354 --> 01:22:39.239]  I was concerned about my cholesterol readings because I knew that high cholesterol is related to clogging of the arteries and increases the risk for heart attack and stroke.
[01:22:39.239 --> 01:22:45.423]  One day, I heard an ad for Heart and Body Extract and I was skeptical, but I decided to give it a try.
[01:22:45.423 --> 01:22:47.324]  Man, the numbers don't lie.
[01:22:47.324 --> 01:22:55.288]  Learn the secrets of an effective, natural, 100% organic nutritional supplement for a healthy heart and circulation at HBExtract.com.
[01:22:57.461 --> 01:23:01.946]  Healthy elimination is essential to high energy, a cheerful mood, and prevention of disease.
[01:23:01.946 --> 01:23:06.791]  Some of the founders of our modern holistic health thinking state that disease begins in a toxic colon.
[01:23:06.791 --> 01:23:14.260]  A toxic intestinal tract is the foundation for virtually all degenerative disease, and a clean and well-moving intestinal tract is the foundation of health.
[01:23:14.500 --> 01:23:17.161]  I just want to say that you folks have an amazing product.
[01:23:17.161 --> 01:23:21.623]  I've taken away protein products for years and I've never noticed the results I have with your product.
[01:23:21.623 --> 01:23:24.804]  I've suffered with thoughts of constipation most of my life.
[01:23:24.804 --> 01:23:28.945]  Within a few days of taking One World Away, I noticed a dramatic change.
[01:23:28.945 --> 01:23:33.047]  Also in the past few years, I've experienced symptoms associated with diabetes.
[01:23:33.047 --> 01:23:36.508]  I feel horrible when I've had too much sugar and I've been getting the foot pain as well.
[01:23:37.108 --> 01:23:38.590]  Call 888-988-3325 or visit OneWorldWay.com
[01:24:17.549 --> 01:24:18.770]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:24:18.770 --> 01:24:19.351]  I'm David Knight.
[01:24:19.351 --> 01:24:23.315]  We're going to be joined in the next segment by Leanne McAdoo here in the studio.
[01:24:23.315 --> 01:24:31.524]  Before we get back to the news, I just want to let you know that we now have a sale on InfoWars Silver Bullet at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:24:31.524 --> 01:24:32.766]  It's 50% off right now.
[01:24:32.766 --> 01:24:35.969]  We have the biggest sale we've ever had on Silver Bullet.
[01:24:35.969 --> 01:24:37.030]  It's down to $14.95 from $29.95.
[01:24:39.773 --> 01:24:41.554]  This is preparedness grade of silver.
[01:24:41.554 --> 01:24:44.316]  It's concentrated to 30 parts per million.
[01:24:44.316 --> 01:24:47.118]  That's much higher than you'll find in a lot of colloidal silvers.
[01:24:47.118 --> 01:24:50.601]  We've been sold out for months, but now we've got it in stock.
[01:24:50.601 --> 01:24:55.624]  Now is the time to stock up on this for your preparedness.
[01:24:55.624 --> 01:24:57.566]  And you can get it for 50% off.
[01:24:57.566 --> 01:24:58.787]  That's $14.95, usually $29.95 at Infowarslife.com.
[01:25:04.423 --> 01:25:25.493]  Now, we've been talking about the Trans-Pacific Partnership and where this is all headed, and of course, as I mentioned in the first hour as well, I think it's something that we should all, that you should hear again, is the fact that Greece is now going to go in and start taking money from all the different government departments to turn it over to paying the banks, giving it to the central bank.
[01:25:25.493 --> 01:25:30.396]  Forget any obligations that they had made to their citizens, they're going to turn it over to the bank.
[01:25:31.176 --> 01:25:34.357]  Understand that that's what's going to happen in America as well.
[01:25:34.357 --> 01:25:39.078]  If we go off the petrodollar, that's exactly what's going to happen here in America.
[01:25:39.078 --> 01:25:43.899]  We've already seen it happen in Venezuela, where the bankers bragged about their return on investment.
[01:25:43.899 --> 01:25:58.043]  And the only way that you see people like Alan Greenspan, the president of Pemco, talking about how the only way they see that the EU is going to persist is if it becomes a United States of Europe, in terms of turning its sovereignty over.
[01:25:58.043 --> 01:25:59.123]  That's the way the bankers do it.
[01:25:59.830 --> 01:26:02.431]  They've had these plans now for many, many decades.
[01:26:02.431 --> 01:26:04.072]  We pointed that out.
[01:26:04.072 --> 01:26:21.842]  Bilderberg, as well as the Trilateral Commission, the Council on Foreign Relations, they've all had this goal to create these trading blocks, then use that economic leverage to get sovereignty over the states, and then to combine that sovereignty into a world governance by multinational corporations.
[01:26:21.842 --> 01:26:23.423]  So that's where this is all headed.
[01:26:23.923 --> 01:26:29.888]  That's what you need to understand and you need to get active right now because this is going to be in just a very, very short time.
[01:26:29.888 --> 01:26:36.833]  They've already passed the fast track to get this thing before Congress where they're not going to be allowed to amend it whatsoever.
[01:26:36.833 --> 01:26:38.355]  And they're not going to be allowed to see it.
[01:26:38.355 --> 01:26:45.000]  We've had groups like EFF, Electronic Frontiers Foundation, concerned about digital rights.
[01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:47.042]  This is about a lot more than trade.
[01:26:47.762 --> 01:26:53.063]  Just within the agreement, what we've seen leaked by WikiLeaks, we know that this is about sovereignty.
[01:26:53.063 --> 01:26:54.944]  This is a very dangerous thing.
[01:26:54.944 --> 01:26:56.564]  We need to stop this.
[01:26:56.564 --> 01:26:59.005]  And we can stop it if people speak out about it.
[01:26:59.005 --> 01:27:00.065]  That's one of the things that we've seen.
[01:27:00.065 --> 01:27:05.307]  This is where we're talking about the change in the public's perspective and understanding about the Second Amendment.
[01:27:06.252 --> 01:27:12.154]  You can get change if people will stand up and educate each other and then stand up and resist this.
[01:27:12.154 --> 01:27:13.794]  We see it time and time again.
[01:27:13.794 --> 01:27:14.955]  It can happen peacefully.
[01:27:14.955 --> 01:27:18.776]  If we don't do it, we're going to be devastated economically.
[01:27:18.776 --> 01:27:21.517]  We may have a situation that precipitates martial law.
[01:27:21.997 --> 01:27:26.119]  But either way, we're going to be devastated economically and we will lose our sovereignty even more so.
[01:27:26.119 --> 01:27:28.861]  We can reverse this, however, if people will wake up.
[01:27:28.861 --> 01:27:40.686]  One of the things we need to wake up about is the fact that they're trying to ram down our throats this loss of informed consent, saying they're going to take away our personal belief exemption.
[01:27:40.686 --> 01:27:43.468]  That's the kind of language that they use to fool you.
[01:27:44.068 --> 01:27:45.829]  No, it isn't a personal belief.
[01:27:45.829 --> 01:27:50.230]  It's my information, my informed consent.
[01:27:50.230 --> 01:27:50.550]  Okay?
[01:27:50.550 --> 01:27:51.631]  That's what it's all about.
[01:27:51.631 --> 01:27:55.652]  And that has to be one of the cornerstones of anything in medicine.
[01:27:55.652 --> 01:27:58.914]  Look at this story that came out last Friday on InfoWars.com.
[01:27:58.914 --> 01:28:03.055]  Brain damage victims of swine flu vaccine win $63 million lawsuit.
[01:28:03.055 --> 01:28:05.776]  When I looked at that, I thought, how did they get any money?
[01:28:05.776 --> 01:28:07.437]  Because we have a vaccine court.
[01:28:07.437 --> 01:28:10.338]  You can't sue the vaccine companies and get any money.
[01:28:10.338 --> 01:28:10.678]  Remember?
[01:28:11.358 --> 01:28:23.072]  That was something that was put in by Ronald Reagan back in the 1980s because there were so many lawsuits against the pharmaceutical companies because they were injuring so many people with their vaccines that they created a vaccine course.
[01:28:23.072 --> 01:28:25.674]  So how did these people get 63 million dollars?
[01:28:25.674 --> 01:28:25.875]  Well...
[01:28:26.255 --> 01:28:29.697]  This is because it's in the UK, where they haven't done that.
[01:28:29.697 --> 01:28:33.820]  People can still sue for damages, so that's why they got that money.
[01:28:33.820 --> 01:28:44.267]  They pointed out that since 2003, in the last 12 years, just one pharmaceutical company, GlaxoSmithKline, has paid out over $9 billion in injuries.
[01:28:44.267 --> 01:28:44.967]  There you go.
[01:28:44.967 --> 01:28:46.829]  But you're not going to get compensated in the United States.
[01:28:46.829 --> 01:28:54.133]  Instead, you're going to be forced to buy a product from companies who have absolutely no liability.
[01:28:55.174 --> 01:28:57.236]  Doesn't that make you stop and think?
[01:28:57.236 --> 01:29:01.239]  Aren't you questioning what they are forcing on you and your family?
[01:29:01.239 --> 01:29:02.300]  You should.
[01:29:02.300 --> 01:29:08.705]  And you should be very concerned because it was just about a year and a half ago that they said they were going to stop all research on antibiotics.
[01:29:08.705 --> 01:29:11.327]  They were going to focus exclusively on vaccines.
[01:29:12.128 --> 01:29:13.289]  And they are.
[01:29:13.289 --> 01:29:18.773]  And that makes perfectly good sense because if they injure people with antibiotics, they have some liability.
[01:29:18.773 --> 01:29:21.935]  In America, if they do it with vaccines, they don't.
[01:29:21.935 --> 01:29:29.121]  We see that they're working with the government to create genetically engineered vaccines.
[01:29:29.121 --> 01:29:34.545]  They're altering the DNA of these viruses and using that as the vaccine.
[01:29:34.545 --> 01:29:36.366]  What could possibly go wrong?
[01:29:36.366 --> 01:29:37.007]  Stay with us.
[01:29:37.007 --> 01:29:37.747]  We're going to be right back.
[01:29:47.768 --> 01:29:51.715]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:51.715 --> 01:29:54.400]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:59.016 --> 01:30:01.338]  Do you know what it means to be an American?
[01:30:01.338 --> 01:30:02.819]  It's more than a flag.
[01:30:02.819 --> 01:30:05.681]  It's more than knowing the star-spangled banner.
[01:30:05.681 --> 01:30:07.282]  It's knowing the Constitution.
[01:30:07.282 --> 01:30:10.365]  It's understanding those rights and fighting for them.
[01:30:10.365 --> 01:30:17.190]  Our country is falling apart because people have forgotten to fight, to stand up in the face of tyranny and do the right thing.
[01:30:17.190 --> 01:30:19.652]  It's putting your life on the line to protect your country.
[01:30:19.872 --> 01:30:20.693]  I don't know.
[01:30:36.312 --> 01:30:41.215]  I'm Joe Biggs with Infowars.com, and I believe our flag is more than cloth and ink.
[01:30:41.215 --> 01:30:44.297]  It is a symbol that stands for liberty and freedom.
[01:30:44.297 --> 01:30:49.460]  It is a history of our nation, and it's marked by the blood of those who died defending it.
[01:30:49.460 --> 01:30:51.201]  So join me in this Infowar.
[01:30:51.201 --> 01:30:55.644]  Turn off your TV, put your Cheetos down, get off your butt and join the resistance.
[01:30:58.991 --> 01:31:00.312]  The experts are clear.

[01:33:43.759 --> 01:33:47.922]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:47.922 --> 01:33:49.263]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:49.263 --> 01:33:50.845]  I'm David Knight, your host today.
[01:33:50.845 --> 01:33:55.569]  On this Monday, April 20th, 2015, joining me in the studio now is Leanne McAdoo.
[01:33:55.569 --> 01:33:59.191]  Leanne, the article that was up at the top of the Drudge Report
[01:34:00.715 --> 01:34:08.742]  Earlier today was this new book about Hillary Clinton and Bill Clinton as well called Clinton Cash.
[01:34:08.742 --> 01:34:12.005]  She's been trying to appear to be one of the people.
[01:34:12.005 --> 01:34:16.108]  She went to a Chipotle and got her picture taken at the Chipotle.
[01:34:16.108 --> 01:34:17.370]  Of course, nobody recognized her.
[01:34:18.230 --> 01:34:21.612]  The staff went in there and got the security footage and showed it to the press.
[01:34:21.612 --> 01:34:35.562]  But anyway, so that's kind of sparked off this whole competition with Marco Rubio and Jeb Bush trying to be a more common man, trying to relate to us through going to Chipotle and getting fast food, I guess.
[01:34:35.562 --> 01:34:35.802]  Right.
[01:34:35.802 --> 01:34:38.684]  But now this is pretty much going to be fatal to her, I think.
[01:34:39.324 --> 01:34:39.765]  I don't know.
[01:34:39.765 --> 01:34:40.646]  It's hard to say.
[01:34:40.646 --> 01:34:50.661]  I think people in the Democrat Party are really getting fed up with it because that's one thing they don't like to see is somebody that's really milking the system.
[01:34:50.661 --> 01:34:51.983]  However, she is a woman.
[01:34:51.983 --> 01:34:52.884]  Right.
[01:34:52.884 --> 01:34:54.587]  So we should vote for her no matter how corrupt.
[01:34:54.747 --> 01:34:58.530]  Yes, once again, Hillary Clinton is the poor victim here.
[01:34:58.530 --> 01:35:08.297]  It's not that she's been corrupt and, you know, giving out friends with benefits type thing here through her State Department with some of these foreign entities.
[01:35:08.297 --> 01:35:18.144]  But she's basically saying that this book is just, it's just more partisan politics and that it's all conspiracy theories and things like that.
[01:35:18.144 --> 01:35:22.907]  But the author of this book goes into really great detail and meticulously
[01:35:24.331 --> 01:35:24.834]  Sources.
[01:35:25.959 --> 01:35:28.481]  Everything that he, all the claims that he's bringing forth in this book.
[01:35:28.481 --> 01:35:32.283]  So this isn't something that she can just brush off as a conspiracy theory.
[01:35:32.283 --> 01:35:35.445]  Now, Rand Paul had talked about it, said he thought it was going to be pretty devastating.
[01:35:35.445 --> 01:35:39.248]  The New York Times actually got a copy of it yesterday.
[01:35:39.248 --> 01:35:44.171]  They wrote an article yesterday based on an advanced copy that they got of it, and they've got some clips.
[01:35:44.171 --> 01:35:46.113]  Let's play the comment from Rand Paul, though.
[01:35:46.113 --> 01:35:48.194]  Everybody is laughing at Hillary.
[01:35:48.194 --> 01:35:49.875]  She's essentially becoming a caricature.
[01:35:49.875 --> 01:35:52.517]  I mean, you've even got Saturday Night Live taking hits at her.
[01:35:52.517 --> 01:35:54.058]  That could be pretty devastating.
[01:35:54.398 --> 01:36:05.003]  I remember when they did that to Gerald Ford, playing up the idea that he was constantly falling over things or, you know, hitting his head on things.
[01:36:05.003 --> 01:36:07.424]  And they basically made a laughing stock of him.
[01:36:07.424 --> 01:36:13.267]  Hillary, on the other hand, is somebody that is obviously very hungry for power.
[01:36:13.267 --> 01:36:18.949]  She is courting this power from the most powerful of the financial community.
[01:36:18.949 --> 01:36:21.310]  And that's not going to sit well with a lot of people in her party.
[01:36:21.310 --> 01:36:23.011]  But this is what Rand Paul had to say.
[01:36:24.351 --> 01:36:30.032]  I'm starting to worry that when Hillary Clinton travels, there's going to need to be two planes.
[01:36:30.032 --> 01:36:41.655]  One for her and her entourage, and one for her baggage.
[01:36:41.655 --> 01:36:47.836]  I'm concerned that the plane with the baggage is really getting heavy and teetering.
[01:36:47.836 --> 01:36:53.037]  And I'm concerned, really, that there probably will end up being more of a primary than anybody thinks over there.
[01:36:53.863 --> 01:36:58.287]  Yeah, I think basically he was using that baggage as a double entendre.
[01:36:58.287 --> 01:37:03.671]  Not just about her vast personal wealth, which she said that, you know, she really struggled when they left the White House.
[01:37:03.671 --> 01:37:05.492]  They were dead broke.
[01:37:05.492 --> 01:37:06.593]  Just like us.
[01:37:06.593 --> 01:37:07.714]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:37:07.714 --> 01:37:11.517]  And on that note, there was another article on the Drudge Report.
[01:37:11.517 --> 01:37:14.640]  By one measure, Hillary earned more than America's top 10 CEOs.
[01:37:14.640 --> 01:37:17.982]  And that one measure was, what does she make per hour?
[01:37:17.982 --> 01:37:19.183]  Well, you know, she makes about $300,000 per hour.
[01:37:21.385 --> 01:37:23.748]  You know, she gets $300,000 for a one-hour speech.
[01:37:23.748 --> 01:37:34.659]  And so they say, well, if you look at what the top 10 CEOs make and you break that down per hour, you've got the number two guy making $63,000 an hour.
[01:37:34.659 --> 01:37:37.482]  You've got the second best paid CEO on the Forbes list gets $32,000.
[01:37:39.224 --> 01:37:39.605]  I don't know.
[01:37:53.513 --> 01:37:55.314]  $300,000 per hour.
[01:37:55.314 --> 01:37:56.455]  Right.
[01:37:56.455 --> 01:38:07.181]  Going to colleges to champion how students need to not be saddled there with debt from their schooling and it's going to pay for people like her to come speak for $300,000.
[01:38:07.181 --> 01:38:07.642]  Exactly.
[01:38:07.642 --> 01:38:12.485]  Student funds, what they're having to pay is going to go to Hillary Clinton and she lectures them on
[01:38:12.945 --> 01:38:14.226]  On turning over all their money.
[01:38:14.226 --> 01:38:14.426]  Right.
[01:38:14.426 --> 01:38:14.926]  That's interesting.
[01:38:14.926 --> 01:38:24.030]  Yeah, the Clinton's income was at least $136.5 million dollars from 2001 to 2012, according to this book.
[01:38:24.030 --> 01:38:25.311]  So yeah, dead broke.
[01:38:25.311 --> 01:38:25.691]  Yeah.
[01:38:25.691 --> 01:38:34.575]  Well, see, the thing is, is that we're getting these elections where it's going like $2 billion, you know, for the candidates to go through there.
[01:38:34.575 --> 01:38:35.915]  They buy a lot of media.
[01:38:35.915 --> 01:38:37.136]  The media is for sale.
[01:38:38.510 --> 01:38:42.392]  And we should really question, though, what they're getting for this.
[01:38:42.392 --> 01:38:43.773]  As I mentioned before, H.L.
[01:38:43.773 --> 01:38:46.835]  Mencken said an election is an advanced auction of stolen goods.
[01:38:46.835 --> 01:38:50.557]  She's getting a lot of money from foreign corporations.
[01:38:50.557 --> 01:38:57.761]  And, of course, he points out that those foreign corporations, when they gave money to the Clinton Foundation, they got favorable treatment at the State Department.
[01:38:57.761 --> 01:39:06.046]  So the guy who wrote this book, Clinton Cash, the untold story of how and why foreign governments and businesses helped to make Bill and Hillary rich.
[01:39:06.946 --> 01:39:09.307]  That could be really devastating to her.
[01:39:09.307 --> 01:39:10.087]  Right.
[01:39:10.087 --> 01:39:14.989]  And again, it's not that there's this dynasty and that Americans just want to vote for this dynasty.
[01:39:14.989 --> 01:39:20.850]  They continue to choose the Bushes and the Clintons because their track record is proven.
[01:39:20.850 --> 01:39:30.313]  They will consistently vote for the policies that are going to put more money in the pockets of their rich, wealthy friends and corporations.
[01:39:30.313 --> 01:39:31.254]  So that's the business.
[01:39:31.254 --> 01:39:35.475]  Businesses, they don't take risks when they're betting, so the Clintons and the Bushes are
[01:39:36.295 --> 01:39:38.297]  Well, it's a huge return on investment.
[01:39:38.297 --> 01:39:47.865]  If you go back and you look at the money that corporations give to these politicians and then the kind of contracts that they get in return, they can't do any better investment and that's essentially the problem.
[01:39:47.865 --> 01:39:51.248]  You're never going to be able to stop this by legislation.
[01:39:51.248 --> 01:39:55.292]  You're going to have to remove the power and the money out of Washington.
[01:39:55.532 --> 01:39:55.672]  Right.
[01:39:55.672 --> 01:40:07.056]  Because otherwise it is this black hole for power, for corruption, and it creates this gravitational force that is going to pull the corruption in no matter what you do.
[01:40:07.056 --> 01:40:10.637]  So you're going to have to take away that consolidated mass there.
[01:40:10.637 --> 01:40:16.939]  One of the things they pointed out in the New York Times article was that in 2010 there was a million dollars, I'm sorry,
[01:40:17.979 --> 01:40:25.967]  They said there was a million dollars in this book, they point out, in payments to Clinton by a Canadian bank and a major shareholder in the Keystone pipeline.
[01:40:25.967 --> 01:40:26.308]  Right.
[01:40:26.308 --> 01:40:31.373]  Now one of the things that we see, and I mentioned earlier, Clinton was a huge backer of NAFTA.
[01:40:31.373 --> 01:40:33.835]  He sold it to everybody as something that was going to create jobs.
[01:40:33.835 --> 01:40:36.858]  Instead it eviscerated jobs, especially manufacturing jobs in this country.
[01:40:38.271 --> 01:41:02.126]  But we see that Keystone Pipeline, for example, they have given the Canadian company that is running this thing, they have given them the rights of eminent domain where they can condemn land in America, take land from farmers that have had it in their family for over a hundred years, and giving that condemnation power to a foreign corporation.
[01:41:02.126 --> 01:41:05.829]  That's what NAFTA looks like, that's what TPP looks like, and the way they get it
[01:41:06.189 --> 01:41:06.369]  I think?
[01:41:27.671 --> 01:41:30.474]  I don't really understand the nuances of the election law.
[01:41:30.474 --> 01:41:37.080]  I don't understand how what they did as a bundler is different from what Dinesh D'Souza did when he went to jail.
[01:41:37.080 --> 01:41:40.183]  He was just naively trying to participate in the process.
[01:41:40.183 --> 01:41:44.087]  These guys, though, they go through, they understand the laws because they wrote them.
[01:41:44.087 --> 01:41:49.612]  So he's got 11 firms that received new Florida pension investments under Jeb Bush.
[01:41:50.032 --> 01:41:54.076]  That were all pioneer backers of his brother when he ran for president.
[01:41:54.076 --> 01:41:59.521]  So it happens with both parties, and especially with these two royal families.
[01:41:59.521 --> 01:42:00.762]  Right, absolutely.
[01:42:00.762 --> 01:42:07.668]  And here, you know, we see these big donors, if their guy gets into the presidency, they'll end up getting these cushy jobs.
[01:42:07.668 --> 01:42:11.271]  Maybe they'll be the ambassador to some small country or something like that.
[01:42:11.271 --> 01:42:16.475]  So of course, when you have foreign donors, they're expecting a little bit of kickback as well.
[01:42:17.276 --> 01:42:36.489]  And a lot of the countries, Rand Paul is pointing out, if there's really a war on women, well, why don't you return some of the money from Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, or Brunei, where people there are being murdered for being gay, you know, or for beheadings, adultery, imprisonment for women.
[01:42:36.489 --> 01:42:37.689]  Yeah, there's a real war on women.
[01:42:37.689 --> 01:42:39.270]  It's not a metaphorical war on women.
[01:42:39.270 --> 01:42:41.732]  There is a real war on women in Saudi Arabia.
[01:42:41.732 --> 01:42:43.273]  Of course, there are close allies.
[01:42:43.433 --> 01:42:44.574]  Yeah, oh yeah.
[01:42:44.574 --> 01:42:48.297]  They're the worst of the worst when it comes to human rights ranking.
[01:42:48.297 --> 01:42:51.280]  They're again and again the worst of the worst.
[01:42:51.280 --> 01:42:52.140]  And so that's what it is.
[01:42:52.140 --> 01:42:54.262]  We'll give you millions of dollars.
[01:42:54.262 --> 01:42:59.567]  I think it was like 7.3 million from Saudi Arabia from 1999 till 2014.
[01:42:59.567 --> 01:43:08.595]  So millions of dollars funneling in and it's almost like we're going to give you all this money so that you'll look away from what we're doing to the people of our own country.
[01:43:09.315 --> 01:43:17.557]  And, you know, because typically we would be putting economic sanctions against these countries with these atrocious human rights records.
[01:43:17.557 --> 01:43:20.897]  But not Saudi Arabia, not the United Arab Emirates, not Brunei.
[01:43:20.897 --> 01:43:22.278]  No, absolutely not.
[01:43:22.278 --> 01:43:23.218]  Yeah, it's amazing.
[01:43:23.218 --> 01:43:25.558]  It'll be interesting to look at this in greater detail.
[01:43:25.558 --> 01:43:30.479]  As I pointed out, this is an article, New York Times, you'll find that linked on the Drudge Report.
[01:43:30.479 --> 01:43:36.361]  The book is Clinton Cash, The Untold Story of How and Why Foreign Governments and Businesses Helped to Make Bill and Hillary Rich.
[01:43:36.361 --> 01:43:37.561]  Yeah, they were rich.
[01:43:37.561 --> 01:43:38.261]  They were not.
[01:43:38.901 --> 01:43:42.143]  Uh, just scraping by, she pointed out, when they came out.
[01:43:42.143 --> 01:43:46.566]  But I thought it was also interesting, this phony position that she's got going.
[01:43:46.566 --> 01:43:49.368]  At the same time, all of this is the reality of Hillary Clinton.
[01:43:49.368 --> 01:43:59.574]  The persona that she's trying to project is she's going across the country in this silly little van episode, and she goes into a Chipotle and she has her picture taken.
[01:43:59.574 --> 01:44:01.656]  And then, if that wasn't bad enough,
[01:44:02.714 --> 01:44:06.896]  Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio have to join in in the game, okay?
[01:44:06.896 --> 01:44:11.538]  And they have to go in to Chipotle and say, I do tip.
[01:44:11.538 --> 01:44:13.579]  Because she got criticized for not tipping, okay?
[01:44:13.579 --> 01:44:14.900]  The guy said, oh yeah, I remember her.
[01:44:14.900 --> 01:44:16.441]  Yeah, they didn't leave any money and everything.
[01:44:16.441 --> 01:44:20.063]  So Marco Rubio goes in and says, no, I always tip.
[01:44:20.783 --> 01:44:29.328]  And then he had to walk that back, because when he talked to the guy that was with him, his staff, he says, well, no, we didn't, but we typically always do.
[01:44:29.328 --> 01:44:29.989]  That kind of stuff.
[01:44:29.989 --> 01:44:33.531]  And then Jeb Bush says, well, I drive to Chipotle myself.
[01:44:33.531 --> 01:44:36.433]  Because Hillary Clinton says that she hasn't driven since 1996, OK?
[01:44:36.433 --> 01:44:38.914]  So, yes, I'm not an elitist.
[01:44:38.914 --> 01:44:41.796]  Being a member of the Bush family, I drive to Chipotle myself.
[01:44:41.796 --> 01:44:44.098]  I pick the stuff up and I drive it home and I eat it, OK?
[01:44:44.918 --> 01:44:47.459]  The reality is that George H.W.
[01:44:47.459 --> 01:44:55.061]  Bush, I remember when the guy was campaigning for president and he went to a grocery store and he was absolutely stunned by the barcode reader.
[01:44:55.061 --> 01:44:56.402]  He'd never seen one.
[01:44:56.402 --> 01:45:00.303]  He'd never been in a grocery store or any place to go shopping.
[01:45:00.303 --> 01:45:06.985]  These guys don't drive themselves, they don't shop for themselves, they don't go into any of these restaurants or whatever, except when they're campaigning.
[01:45:06.985 --> 01:45:09.226]  It is the most phony thing you can imagine.
[01:45:09.406 --> 01:45:16.651]  It's like when Gwyneth Paltrow just tried to be so noble and she said, I'm going to try and live off like what people on welfare do.
[01:45:16.651 --> 01:45:19.113]  I'm going to go to the grocery store with just $29.
[01:45:19.113 --> 01:45:25.757]  And she bought all of this stuff that clearly shows how out of touch she is with the average person who is shopping on welfare.
[01:45:25.757 --> 01:45:29.920]  I think she lasted about two days with all of her limes and greens and everything.
[01:45:29.940 --> 01:45:41.408]  Somebody that's shopping on welfare with a $29 a week budget, they're going to be buying stuff like ramen noodles, not going to be buying organic vegetables, and that's one of the reasons why we've got the obesity issues that we've got in here.
[01:45:41.408 --> 01:45:53.277]  But they're going to have to buy the ultra cheapest food, and that's going to be loaded with all kinds of toxic preservatives and fillers, and it's basically soil and green, but it comes in a variety of different colors.
[01:45:54.618 --> 01:45:55.859]  Tons of flavors!
[01:45:55.859 --> 01:46:19.782]  Well, and you know, I gotta give it to Rand Paul because, you know, that's one thing that I do appreciate about him is that he, rather than following what the reporters are choosing to speak about, which is Hillary Clinton at Chipotle, so rather than jumping on that little bandwagon, he's been getting out ahead of them and spinning the normal narrative around where it's usually only Republicans and things that are gonna be asked about their stance on abortion.
[01:46:20.242 --> 01:46:30.169]  And he got right out there and made this huge thing about, well, why don't you ask the Democratic Party about if they think life starts or if they think it's okay to kill a seven-pound baby.
[01:46:30.169 --> 01:46:31.150]  And that's the key thing.
[01:46:31.150 --> 01:46:33.632]  Talking about a seven-pound baby.
[01:46:33.632 --> 01:46:40.256]  Not talking about the term, not talking about some kind of abstract thing about, well, philosophically, when does life begin?
[01:46:40.256 --> 01:46:49.383]  I remember when I ran for Congress as a Libertarian Party candidate, and it was really kind of just a paper candidacy, but I participated in some debates.
[01:46:50.325 --> 01:46:54.368]  And I remember people asking me about that, and I had never really thought about abortion.
[01:46:54.368 --> 01:46:56.029]  I never had to think about it personally.
[01:46:56.029 --> 01:47:01.113]  And I remember when I looked up, partial birth abortion was the issue at that point in time, and I said, okay.
[01:47:01.113 --> 01:47:07.658]  I realized at that point that it was no longer, I realized that it wasn't about a dispute as to when life began.
[01:47:07.658 --> 01:47:12.361]  They were willing to kill full-term babies, and that was the key with what Rand Paul said.
[01:47:12.361 --> 01:47:12.802]  Right.
[01:47:12.802 --> 01:47:15.904]  When he said, would you kill a seven-pound baby?
[01:47:16.144 --> 01:47:16.544]  Yeah.
[01:47:16.544 --> 01:47:17.705]  People can relate to that.
[01:47:17.705 --> 01:47:28.732]  He said nobody went out and asked, no journalist went and asked Hillary Clinton how she felt about late-term abortions while she was out talking about her daughter about to give birth.
[01:47:28.732 --> 01:47:29.412]  Yeah.
[01:47:29.412 --> 01:47:41.640]  I mean, if that was a Republican, you know, if the tables were turned, it would be a completely different opportunity for them to say, well, you know, late-term abortions, I mean, this could be Chelsea, and nobody went there with Clinton.
[01:47:41.980 --> 01:47:47.054]  So once again, we're probably going to see no one going there with Clinton on these donations.
[01:47:47.054 --> 01:47:48.157]  Yeah, we got that clip.
[01:47:48.157 --> 01:47:49.139]  Let's play that clip.
[01:47:51.841 --> 01:47:55.444]  Senator, the DNC is picking up on your comments you made with AP this morning on abortion.
[01:47:55.444 --> 01:47:58.306]  They just want to know where you stand on exceptions.
[01:47:58.306 --> 01:48:00.828]  Should there be any exceptions for abortion or not?
[01:48:00.828 --> 01:48:02.649]  What's the DNC say?
[01:48:02.649 --> 01:48:06.332]  You know, I guess here's the question.
[01:48:06.332 --> 01:48:13.538]  You know, we always seem to have the debate way over here on what are the exact details of exceptions or when it starts.
[01:48:14.458 --> 01:48:20.361]  Why don't we ask the DNC, is it okay to kill a 7-pound baby in the uterus?
[01:48:20.361 --> 01:48:27.945]  You go back and you ask Debbie Wasserman Schultz if she's okay with killing a 7-pound baby that is just not yet born yet.
[01:48:27.945 --> 01:48:33.348]  Ask her when life begins, and you ask Debbie when she's willing to protect life.
[01:48:33.348 --> 01:48:35.789]  When you get an answer from Debbie, come back to me.
[01:48:35.789 --> 01:48:36.369]  Thank you guys.
[01:48:44.273 --> 01:48:49.538]  When I took a look at this for the first time and I realized what the real agenda was and it changed my mind on it.
[01:48:49.538 --> 01:48:54.302]  It's one of the things that was really important that came out of me getting involved in that process that time.
[01:48:54.302 --> 01:49:05.652]  I think Rand Paul has been an absolute master so far in terms of the way that he has put this stuff out and in terms of addressing vital issues that other people completely avoid.
[01:49:05.652 --> 01:49:05.852]  Right.
[01:49:06.272 --> 01:49:14.278]  I am just absolutely stunned, however, that he has been in full court press for this Trans-Pacific Partnership.
[01:49:14.278 --> 01:49:26.226]  He and Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio and all these people who want to run as Republicans for presidential candidate, they are all signing on to this agreement that is being negotiated by corporate lawyers in secret that we're not allowed to see.
[01:49:26.226 --> 01:49:28.488]  And it just absolutely amazes me.
[01:49:29.188 --> 01:49:37.914]  And I understand it's a difficult thing for a Republican to come up and say, I oppose this free trade agreement, when they put it out there as a free trade agreement.
[01:49:37.914 --> 01:49:43.418]  But you have to get ahead of that and you have to say that it is not free trade, just like the Patriot Act is not patriotic.
[01:49:43.418 --> 01:49:52.605]  They put these labels on and they try to put you in a corner, but real leadership is going to come out there and stand up for American sovereignty and for the American economy.
[01:49:52.605 --> 01:49:55.027]  And we know how this has played out with NAFTA.
[01:49:55.027 --> 01:49:56.468]  We know that 20 years after,
[01:49:57.228 --> 01:49:59.430]  Petraeus and others are saying America is finished.
[01:49:59.430 --> 01:50:00.812]  We no longer have America.
[01:50:00.812 --> 01:50:02.153]  We have North America.
[01:50:02.153 --> 01:50:03.094]  That's what they're saying.
[01:50:03.094 --> 01:50:08.119]  And if you understand, that's their mindset, then the open borders makes absolute, total sense.
[01:50:08.119 --> 01:50:11.423]  And it makes sense as to why the Republicans won't do anything about open borders either.
[01:50:11.966 --> 01:50:12.487]  Absolutely.
[01:50:12.487 --> 01:50:20.074]  And it also, you know, it also sort of seems like they are expecting that it is the end of America.
[01:50:20.074 --> 01:50:27.721]  When you have people like Rand Paul, who has been very outspoken against fast-tracking the TVP, and now he's kind of made an about face.
[01:50:27.721 --> 01:50:28.142]  Yeah, he did.
[01:50:28.582 --> 01:50:34.825]  Obviously a lot of things have been happening with China and Russia and them opening their new banking system and everything.
[01:50:34.825 --> 01:50:37.987]  So they know we've got to make this pivot to Asia.
[01:50:37.987 --> 01:50:41.049]  But why can't we know what it means for America?
[01:50:41.049 --> 01:50:44.591]  How do we know it's good for America if we don't actually know what's in it?
[01:50:44.591 --> 01:50:45.351]  Really disturbed me.
[01:50:45.351 --> 01:50:47.712]  Well Leanne is going to be anchoring the nightly news tonight.
[01:50:47.712 --> 01:50:55.256]  So join us then and I'm probably going to step in a little bit and we'll talk a little bit about Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Transatlantic Partnership.
[01:50:55.256 --> 01:50:56.557]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[01:50:59.309 --> 01:51:03.413]  Communist China freely allows the sale of bulletproof armor plates, while our U.S.
[01:51:03.413 --> 01:51:06.597]  politicians argue from banning Americans from owning body armor.
[01:51:06.597 --> 01:51:08.218]  Does that sound right to you?
[01:51:08.218 --> 01:51:11.582]  Arm your American body at InfidelBodyArmor.com.
[01:51:11.582 --> 01:51:13.083]  Infidel Body Armor.

[01:51:15.084 --> 01:51:17.267]  Hi, Ted Anderson with Midas Resources.
[01:51:17.267 --> 01:51:21.952]  Is it time to convert paper 401ks and IRAs to solid gold and silver yet?

[01:51:30.481 --> 01:51:31.461]  Hey, Boomer!
[01:51:31.461 --> 01:51:34.902]  I learned in school today that 60% of our bodies are made of water.
[01:51:34.902 --> 01:51:36.583]  Good thing we have the Berkey System.
[01:51:36.583 --> 01:51:38.523]  It's the cleanest, best water ever.
[01:51:38.523 --> 01:51:44.365]  Mom says it's because the Berkey's filtration system cleans out the bad stuff and leaves only pure, delicious water.
[01:51:44.365 --> 01:51:45.205]  I know, right?
[01:51:45.205 --> 01:51:46.506]  You love it, too!
[01:51:46.506 --> 01:51:47.946]  Yeah, I'm thirsty, too.
[01:51:47.946 --> 01:51:48.966]  Let's go get some!
[01:51:48.966 --> 01:51:50.727]  Get Berkey Clean Water by calling 877-886-3653.
[01:51:50.727 --> 01:51:51.067]  That's 877-886-3653.

[01:51:59.409 --> 01:52:00.010]  I want more candy!
[01:52:00.010 --> 01:52:00.970]  I want more video games!
[01:52:00.970 --> 01:52:01.150]  Mine!
[01:52:01.150 --> 01:52:01.351]  Mine!
[01:52:01.351 --> 01:52:02.672]  Mine!
[01:52:02.672 --> 01:52:12.359]  And it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and help children focus.
[01:52:12.359 --> 01:52:15.041]  All of our children are hit with modern mind control.
[01:52:15.041 --> 01:52:18.604]  Television, music, fast food, GMOs, sugars, you name it.
[01:52:18.604 --> 01:52:24.929]  Young humans have not yet developed their nervous system and are being hammered daily by globulous concoctions.
[01:52:24.929 --> 01:52:29.292]  It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down and then are put on dangerous psychotropic
[01:52:29.372 --> 01:52:30.132]  I think so.
[01:52:59.284 --> 01:53:05.526]  It's time to build your own emergency food stockpile with the industry leader, My Patriot Supply.
[01:53:05.526 --> 01:53:11.687]  Once you try them, you'll know why so many Americans like you have made them part of their emergency preparedness plan.

[01:53:51.004 --> 01:53:51.964]  You can run on for a long time.
[01:53:51.964 --> 01:53:52.144]  Run on.
[01:54:14.662 --> 01:54:17.484]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:54:17.484 --> 01:54:19.566]  I'm David Knight and joining me is Leanne McAdoo.
[01:54:19.566 --> 01:54:29.353]  We're going to go back and she has a couple more things to say about this Hillary Clinton, Clinton's for Cash, I guess is what they ought to call it, but it's Clinton Cash is the name of the book.
[01:54:30.254 --> 01:54:32.097]  We're going to go back to that in just a moment.
[01:54:32.097 --> 01:54:38.686]  Just want to let you know, as we're talking about the economic hardships that we're seeing in Greece, as I mentioned, we've seen this happen in Venezuela.
[01:54:38.686 --> 01:54:42.952]  They will shut down the country, but they will pay the banks first.
[01:54:42.952 --> 01:54:45.415]  We saw it happen in Venezuela, where the Marxists did it.
[01:54:46.044 --> 01:54:48.926]  And the bankers got 700% return on their investment.
[01:54:48.926 --> 01:54:50.306]  We see that it's happening now.
[01:54:50.306 --> 01:54:53.828]  In Greece, it will happen here if push comes to shove.
[01:54:53.828 --> 01:54:57.290]  You need to be able to, you need to prepare for your family.
[01:54:57.290 --> 01:55:08.956]  You need to have things set aside so that if we have some kind of a drastic economic crisis, and you never know how long it's going to take to come to fruition, you need to be prepared.
[01:55:08.956 --> 01:55:10.397]  That's why we have preppers.
[01:55:10.397 --> 01:55:12.118]  That's why we have people who are into preparedness.
[01:55:12.578 --> 01:55:17.521]  And again, at the InfoWars site, we have a way for you to do this with your food.
[01:55:17.521 --> 01:55:27.366]  Something we don't talk about as often as we have in the past, but there's no better way to protect yourself and have a high quality emergency food supply than to get food from MyPatriotSupply.
[01:55:27.366 --> 01:55:30.567]  We sell that through the InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:55:30.567 --> 01:55:32.929]  Again, you can visit InfoWarsStore right now and you can
[01:55:33.669 --> 01:55:41.013]  Prepare for your family, whatever is coming with My Patriot Supply at the lowest price we have available right there at InfoWars.org.
[01:55:41.013 --> 01:55:46.616]  Of course, that supports our operation as well as lets you provide for an uncertain future.
[01:55:46.616 --> 01:55:57.502]  When we look at the military drills that are going, when we look at these partnerships, these trade agreements that are coming through, I mean, to me, it looks very grim in the near future.
[01:55:57.502 --> 01:56:01.964]  And of course, all we need to have happen, Leanne, is for the petrodollar to tank.
[01:56:02.644 --> 01:56:06.027]  And then all bets are off as to what happens in this country economically.
[01:56:06.027 --> 01:56:12.973]  That's what's kept us in a financial budget, a bubble, should say, for 40 years, is that petrodollar.
[01:56:12.973 --> 01:56:15.014]  Now, we were just talking about this book.
[01:56:15.014 --> 01:56:17.696]  It looks like it's going to be pretty revealing.
[01:56:17.696 --> 01:56:24.162]  But we have an article up on Infowars.com, Hookers for Hillary.
[01:56:24.162 --> 01:56:27.144]  These are people that are in the Nevada
[01:56:28.545 --> 01:56:29.205]  The Bunny Ranch.
[01:56:29.205 --> 01:56:33.308]  Bunny Ranch, which basically is legal prostitution in Nevada.
[01:56:33.308 --> 01:56:37.050]  It's still legal, I think, in Las Vegas, but in the state it's legal.
[01:56:37.050 --> 01:56:41.092]  And they're saying one of the reasons that these Hillary's, these hookers,
[01:56:43.314 --> 01:56:47.956]  One of the reasons that they support her is because of her stance on foreign policy.
[01:56:47.956 --> 01:56:49.677]  They say that's one of the reasons they've endorsed her.
[01:56:49.677 --> 01:56:56.381]  And of course, endorsing her for foreign policy really is saying that she's really one of their own.
[01:56:56.381 --> 01:57:03.544]  Because she has offered herself essentially as a prostitute to these foreign governments, giving money to her foundation.
[01:57:03.544 --> 01:57:09.808]  Has Bill Clinton been collecting the donations from the Bunny Ranch in person?
[01:57:09.808 --> 01:57:10.688]  I don't know, yeah.
[01:57:10.688 --> 01:57:11.469]  I mean, are they his?
[01:57:12.789 --> 01:57:20.715]  Well one of the things I said that I'll stick by any woman that stands by her man in a cheating relationship so that she can further her career.
[01:57:20.715 --> 01:57:21.656]  There you go.
[01:57:21.656 --> 01:57:28.220]  I mean she's furthering her career no matter what happens and she's getting money from these foreign governments no matter what happens.
[01:57:28.220 --> 01:57:29.981]  I mean she basically is
[01:57:31.361 --> 01:57:35.243]  She's not really selling herself, she's selling us, which is really the bad thing.
[01:57:35.243 --> 01:57:40.184]  I mean, I guess you would call her not necessarily a hooker, but she would be a pimp.
[01:57:40.184 --> 01:57:41.805]  She's selling us into slavery.
[01:57:41.805 --> 01:57:46.127]  And she's selling us on the idea of selling ourselves.
[01:57:46.127 --> 01:57:47.467]  She is pimping us out.
[01:57:47.467 --> 01:57:51.929]  So it's apropos that there is now a hookers for Hillary group.
[01:57:52.749 --> 01:58:04.964]  But she wants us to believe that the idea that taking tens of millions of dollars from foreign governments, the idea that we would somehow be influenced by those donations is preposterous.
[01:58:04.964 --> 01:58:11.311]  For us to even accuse her of this is just an absurd conspiracy theory, is what her campaign is saying.
[01:58:11.952 --> 01:58:23.399]  And they know that this at least gives the appearance of corruption because just last week the foundation revised their policy of where they're going to be able to be taking in these foreign donations.
[01:58:23.399 --> 01:58:31.304]  They're still going to be getting them from countries like Germany, Canada, the Netherlands and Britain, but they will prohibit giving by other nations in the Middle East.
[01:58:31.304 --> 01:58:33.245]  So they admit right there that they know that it's wrong.
[01:58:33.245 --> 01:58:38.108]  Thank you so much Leanne McAdoo, she'll be doing the nightly news tonight and I'll probably be joining her as well.
[01:58:38.108 --> 01:58:38.969]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[01:58:39.500 --> 01:58:42.764]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[01:58:48.877 --> 01:58:50.137]  Another major health threat.
[01:58:50.137 --> 01:58:55.099]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[01:58:55.099 --> 01:58:57.780]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[01:58:57.780 --> 01:59:04.822]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[01:59:04.822 --> 01:59:07.803]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[01:59:07.803 --> 01:59:10.764]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[01:59:10.764 --> 01:59:12.784]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[01:59:12.784 --> 01:59:15.625]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[01:59:15.725 --> 01:59:21.427]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[01:59:21.427 --> 01:59:24.949]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[01:59:24.949 --> 01:59:28.030]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[01:59:28.030 --> 01:59:35.353]  The ProPure Pro1 G2.0 Water Filtration System is a must-have for every modern, independently-minded household.

[01:59:45.478 --> 01:59:46.681]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:04.861 --> 02:00:09.704]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:09.704 --> 02:00:11.284]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.284 --> 02:00:12.825]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:12.825 --> 02:00:17.028]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.028 --> 02:00:21.090]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:24.793 --> 02:00:26.075]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:26.075 --> 02:00:27.156]  I'm David Knight.
[02:00:27.156 --> 02:00:29.119]  I'm going to be taking your calls in the next hour.
[02:00:29.119 --> 02:00:34.306]  I want to go over a little bit of news in this segment as well as in the next segment.
[02:00:34.306 --> 02:00:36.349]  But if you want to call in, that number is 800-259-9231.
[02:00:36.349 --> 02:00:41.396]  I'd especially like to hear from people about the Trans-Pacific
[02:00:42.256 --> 02:00:47.919]  The Transatlantic partnerships that are being negotiated by corporate lawyers in secret.
[02:00:47.919 --> 02:00:49.119]  I'd like to get your take on that.
[02:00:49.119 --> 02:00:53.241]  I want to talk a little bit about the media and about vaccines before I do.
[02:00:53.241 --> 02:00:56.943]  There's some stories that have come out about both of these issues right now.
[02:00:56.943 --> 02:00:59.784]  And of course, there's a story up on World Net Daily.
[02:00:59.784 --> 02:01:01.184]  MSNBC is in meltdown.
[02:01:01.184 --> 02:01:06.287]  They call it the media arm of the DNC, the Democrat National Committee.
[02:01:06.287 --> 02:01:09.008]  They say that it's a tailspin if they can only hold out.
[02:01:09.488 --> 02:01:21.316]  For just a little bit longer, all of that cash that Hillary is collecting from foreign corporations, through her foundations, and from big Wall Street banks, she'll be spending that on ads on MSNBC.
[02:01:21.316 --> 02:01:22.056]  You can count on it.
[02:01:22.056 --> 02:01:28.560]  So just hang in there, MSNBC, because real soon, the floodgates of cash are going to open up.
[02:01:28.560 --> 02:01:30.942]  All that Clinton cash is going to be coming your way.
[02:01:31.782 --> 02:01:33.823]  And it's basically become a parody.
[02:01:33.823 --> 02:01:39.965]  Everybody knows that their ratings have absolutely collapsed because they have no integrity whatsoever.
[02:01:39.965 --> 02:01:45.206]  Because they've become, they've essentially just become cheerleaders for one political party.
[02:01:45.206 --> 02:01:48.367]  It's very sad to see that, but that's basically where most of the media is.
[02:01:48.367 --> 02:01:51.088]  You just have to ask yourself, which camp are they in?
[02:01:51.088 --> 02:01:58.211]  Of course, Fox News is in the camp of the Republicans, as well as the big pharmaceutical companies.
[02:01:58.211 --> 02:01:59.111]  They're all in that camp.
[02:01:59.931 --> 02:02:03.233]  That's a bipartisan support that's going on there.
[02:02:03.233 --> 02:02:07.675]  Before we get to that, though, again, CNN also struggling in its ratings.
[02:02:07.675 --> 02:02:15.579]  It's reported by The Hollywood Reporter that they are hiring nearly 40 new political reporters in an effort to boost ratings.
[02:02:15.579 --> 02:02:22.002]  Again, these are going to be political reporters because this is going to be a big financial opportunity for them.
[02:02:22.042 --> 02:02:36.325]  When we talk about the political candidates spending $2 billion on their political campaigns, that money is going to be flowing to the networks who are desperately needing it because people really aren't watching them.
[02:02:36.325 --> 02:02:47.947]  Nevertheless, they will get that political cash coming in, so they want to get political correspondents that will talk about whether or not they left tips at Chipotle.
[02:02:48.627 --> 02:02:50.188]  Because that's really what they're going to talk about.
[02:02:50.188 --> 02:02:52.210]  They're not going to talk about anything of any substance.
[02:02:52.210 --> 02:02:54.071]  They're not going to pin these candidates down.
[02:02:54.071 --> 02:02:56.953]  If they did, they would lose their access.
[02:02:56.953 --> 02:03:00.516]  If they did, they would lose the commercial revenue that's going to them.
[02:03:00.516 --> 02:03:02.157]  So you're not going to see anything of any substance.
[02:03:02.157 --> 02:03:13.065]  You're going to have 40 new political reporters who are going to be reporting on all the minutiae, all of the trivia of the election, talking about it from a horse race standpoint.
[02:03:13.065 --> 02:03:17.769]  They can just talk about that forever and never, ever talk about any of the issues.
[02:03:18.109 --> 02:03:20.110]  It's one of the reasons I'm happy that Rand Paul is running.
[02:03:20.110 --> 02:03:32.137]  As I mentioned, I'm very upset with his position on this sovereignty-destroying, economy-destroying trade agreement that's being negotiated right now between not only Asia but Europe.
[02:03:32.137 --> 02:03:35.118]  I'm very concerned that he would support that as a fast track.
[02:03:35.118 --> 02:03:38.860]  Nevertheless, he is still bringing some important things out to be talked about.
[02:03:38.860 --> 02:03:41.462]  So, I really don't understand why he's supporting it.
[02:03:42.318 --> 02:03:45.739]  Nevertheless, moving on, look at this story from the Miami Herald.
[02:03:45.739 --> 02:03:51.842]  They admit that they spiked a story that would have been a scoop about the Bay of Pigs.
[02:03:51.842 --> 02:03:55.784]  The Miami Herald, the CIA, and the Bay of Pigs scoop that didn't run.
[02:03:55.784 --> 02:04:00.045]  Very interesting story that you'll find at themiamiherald.com.
[02:04:00.045 --> 02:04:01.226]  That's the type of thing
[02:04:02.239 --> 02:04:02.419]  That's
[02:04:18.146 --> 02:04:21.869]  10-foil hat fringe group that nobody would pay any attention to you.
[02:04:21.869 --> 02:04:25.392]  That's why it is so important that we keep the internet free.
[02:04:25.392 --> 02:04:37.941]  That we have alternative media, not just InfoWars, but all the other people who are out there with cameras watching what's going on and the militarized exercises that we see throughout America at unprecedented levels.
[02:04:37.941 --> 02:04:39.522]  That's why we need citizen journalists.
[02:04:39.522 --> 02:04:44.706]  That's why it's very important to keep InfoWars there because we can be a clearinghouse for that as it comes in.
[02:04:44.706 --> 02:04:45.747]  So you don't get
[02:04:46.267 --> 02:04:52.431]  The news stories spiked, like the Miami Herald did, like ABC, NBC, CBS, the rest of them did.
[02:04:52.431 --> 02:04:53.752]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[02:04:58.743 --> 02:05:08.766]  Did you know that only six corporations control 90% of what millions of Americans see, hear, and read every single day?
[02:05:08.766 --> 02:05:10.687]  It's the illusion of choice.
[02:05:10.687 --> 02:05:11.447]  Think about it.
[02:05:11.447 --> 02:05:17.469]  The mainstream media is owned by only a handful of megacorporations with vested interests.
[02:05:17.469 --> 02:05:23.031]  But on the other hand, the Internet is an interconnected network of billions of sources.
[02:05:23.431 --> 02:05:35.459]  So you can research information for yourself from multiple sources, or you can blindly accept what you hear or read in the mainstream media, never questioning what you are being told.
[02:05:35.459 --> 02:05:38.421]  This gives you a false sense of reality.
[02:05:38.421 --> 02:05:41.222]  I mean, do you actually know what you think you know?
[02:05:41.222 --> 02:05:46.106]  Or have you been programmed to accept someone else's version of events?
[02:05:46.106 --> 02:05:46.666]  Think about it.
[02:05:46.886 --> 02:05:58.129]  This is Darren McBreen and I want you to break the matrix at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv and listen to the Alex Jones Show because there's a war on in your mind.
[02:05:59.784 --> 02:06:01.105]  In the near future.
[02:06:01.105 --> 02:06:05.606]  When you realize how fake it all is, the football, the basketball.
[02:06:05.606 --> 02:06:06.827]  Security alert.
[02:06:06.827 --> 02:06:08.847]  This is Homeland Security.
[02:06:08.847 --> 02:06:09.728]  Analysis.
[02:06:09.728 --> 02:06:10.448]  InfoWars.
[02:06:10.448 --> 02:06:12.429]  Building independent media operations.
[02:06:12.429 --> 02:06:17.431]  You let the worst people get controlled and tell us that we are the ones responsible.
[02:06:17.431 --> 02:06:18.451]  Crime directive.
[02:06:18.451 --> 02:06:19.992]  Discredit Alex Jones.
[02:06:19.992 --> 02:06:22.853]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[02:06:22.853 --> 02:06:26.094]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called InfoWars.
[02:06:26.094 --> 02:06:28.395]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[02:06:28.395 --> 02:06:29.275]  These people are assassins.
[02:06:29.315 --> 02:06:36.979]  You've got to set your eye on the enemy, not worry about what propaganda they put out.
[02:06:36.979 --> 02:06:38.379]  Intellectually, it's begun.
[02:06:38.379 --> 02:06:39.700]  You can feel it.
[02:06:58.579 --> 02:07:00.540]  Aging starts at the cellular level.
[02:07:00.540 --> 02:07:04.761]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[02:07:04.761 --> 02:07:09.222]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries.
[02:07:09.222 --> 02:07:16.523]  During that period, key patented compounds have focused on mitochondrial growth, nerve growth, and rejuvenation.
[02:07:16.523 --> 02:07:22.705]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and
[02:07:22.705 --> 02:07:25.807]  And optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[02:07:25.807 --> 02:07:28.009]  We now have the synergistic solution.
[02:07:28.009 --> 02:07:31.371]  DNA Force, just one of the key compounds.
[02:07:31.371 --> 02:07:38.977]  BioPQQ is backed by major clinical studies and over 175 PubMed listed published studies.
[02:07:38.977 --> 02:07:41.538]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[02:07:41.538 --> 02:07:47.022]  The ultimate value, cutting edge, trailblazing game changer that also supports the InfoWar.

[02:08:15.232 --> 02:08:23.732]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:27.748 --> 02:08:28.949]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:28.949 --> 02:08:30.531]  I'm David Knight, your host today.
[02:08:30.531 --> 02:08:34.374]  We've been talking throughout this program about the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
[02:08:34.374 --> 02:08:37.377]  We need to be aware of what's going on with this.
[02:08:37.377 --> 02:08:45.065]  We need to understand that it is very close to being dumped on Congress without the possibility of making an amendment.
[02:08:45.709 --> 02:08:48.070]  It is something that I believe is very dangerous.
[02:08:48.070 --> 02:08:52.292]  I won't repeat what I said earlier about it, but you need to educate yourself.
[02:08:52.292 --> 02:08:53.333]  You need to educate others.
[02:08:53.333 --> 02:08:55.994]  We can do something to reverse this.
[02:08:55.994 --> 02:09:00.236]  We've seen a major reversal in people's understanding of the Second Amendment.
[02:09:00.236 --> 02:09:03.958]  We need to see a major reversal in people's understanding
[02:09:04.618 --> 02:09:08.021]  Of what's going on with these so-called free trade agreements.
[02:09:08.021 --> 02:09:09.483]  We need to push back against this thing.
[02:09:09.483 --> 02:09:10.764]  It is almost too late.
[02:09:10.764 --> 02:09:14.487]  It's been developing for quite some time and they are rushing this through.
[02:09:14.487 --> 02:09:18.531]  The leadership of both parties is pushing for this very hard.
[02:09:18.531 --> 02:09:25.137]  They have been bought and sold by corporate, multinational corporations who are going to be running this thing through.
[02:09:25.137 --> 02:09:27.780]  And I'm going to take some of your calls here in just a moment.
[02:09:27.780 --> 02:09:29.942]  Before we do, I want to talk a little bit about some
[02:09:30.522 --> 02:09:31.162]  We're good to go.
[02:09:55.833 --> 02:09:57.454]  It's gone from $29.95 down to $14.95.
[02:09:57.454 --> 02:10:04.757]  And of course, this is colloidal silver in a preparedness grade at a concentration of 30 parts per million.
[02:10:04.757 --> 02:10:07.659]  That's much higher than you'll find in most colloidal silvers.
[02:10:07.659 --> 02:10:09.760]  Again, that is available for 50% off.
[02:10:09.760 --> 02:10:11.921]  You'll save $15 per bottle.
[02:10:11.921 --> 02:10:14.982]  That's at Infowarslife.com.
[02:10:14.982 --> 02:10:18.104]  Now, I had mentioned earlier that there was this article I saw last week.
[02:10:18.104 --> 02:10:18.344]  It's like,
[02:10:19.181 --> 02:10:26.788]  Brain damage victims sue swine flu vaccine manufacturer, GlaxoSmithKline, and win $63 million in a lawsuit.
[02:10:26.788 --> 02:10:29.631]  And I looked at that and thought, how'd they get any money in a lawsuit?
[02:10:29.631 --> 02:10:36.597]  Because, you know, we have this vaccine court in America, which says you can't sue the pharmaceutical companies for damage that they do to you with vaccines.
[02:10:36.597 --> 02:10:37.257]  Believe it or not.
[02:10:38.140 --> 02:10:49.063]  Well, that was because that was in the UK, and they've gotten $9 billion worth of damages, people in the UK, in the last 12 years from just that one pharmaceutical company.
[02:10:49.063 --> 02:10:52.444]  But there's some very disturbing trends going on with vaccines.
[02:10:52.444 --> 02:10:58.806]  Of course, we all know they're trying to take away our informed consent, which is one of the things that separates us from slavery.
[02:10:58.806 --> 02:11:06.469]  It's one of the things that separates a society from the kind of contempt for the human that we saw at Nazi concentration camps.
[02:11:07.824 --> 02:11:17.889]  The Nuremberg Code said that we have to have informed consent before they can do anything to us, even if you try to justify it for the public good.
[02:11:17.889 --> 02:11:23.052]  That was what Mengele and other so-called doctors did at these camps.
[02:11:23.052 --> 02:11:24.473]  It's what the Japanese were doing.
[02:11:24.473 --> 02:11:28.975]  They were experimenting on humans, pulling their blood out, replacing it with seawater.
[02:11:28.975 --> 02:11:34.478]  Horrific experiments that they were doing on these individuals and say, well, it really doesn't matter because, you know, the individual
[02:11:35.018 --> 02:11:36.779]  Is not as important as the collective.
[02:11:36.779 --> 02:11:39.521]  And this is for the collective good.
[02:11:39.521 --> 02:11:47.465]  Sounds a lot like these senators at the state level who are introducing these vaccine mandatory bills.
[02:11:47.465 --> 02:11:51.167]  Saying, we don't really care about your informed consent.
[02:11:51.167 --> 02:11:54.309]  We don't really care if this is safe and effective for you.
[02:11:54.309 --> 02:11:56.750]  This is about the greater good of society.
[02:11:56.750 --> 02:11:59.412]  They admit that their vaccines don't convey immunity.
[02:11:59.412 --> 02:12:02.394]  So they have this thing they made up called herd immunity.
[02:12:02.394 --> 02:12:02.574]  Look,
[02:12:03.314 --> 02:12:08.096]  If you can't get individual immunity, herd immunity is just a figment of your imagination.
[02:12:08.096 --> 02:12:12.839]  Or I should say, it's an invention of a pharmaceutical salesman.
[02:12:12.839 --> 02:12:16.320]  But look at some of the vaccines that are on the list, on their way to you.
[02:12:16.320 --> 02:12:21.563]  This is why you need to be very, very concerned about informed consent.
[02:12:21.563 --> 02:12:25.445]  Because we've pointed out that the vaccines that they're currently trying to force on you
[02:12:26.480 --> 02:12:31.123]  Are not just simply vaccines in the way that Louis Pasteur put them together.
[02:12:31.123 --> 02:12:37.347]  No, Louis Pasteur never put, loaded his vaccines with preservatives, with adjuvants.
[02:12:38.598 --> 02:12:45.426]  He didn't put aluminum in it to try to annoy your immune system and create other issues with it.
[02:12:45.426 --> 02:12:50.651]  He didn't put formaldehyde in it so he could get longer shelf life and higher profits.
[02:12:50.651 --> 02:12:56.938]  And so that's why these are not, it's not simply about the science of vaccinations, about the idea of active immunity.
[02:12:56.938 --> 02:12:58.660]  No, it is far more than that.
[02:12:58.820 --> 02:13:00.981]  It's about the other things that they do to it as well.
[02:13:00.981 --> 02:13:04.583]  But look at what they're doing to the essence of the vaccines.
[02:13:04.583 --> 02:13:14.468]  We've got a company, this is a press release, Geovax enters into the research collaboration agreement with the National Institute of Health for Ebola and Marburg vaccines.
[02:13:14.468 --> 02:13:15.809]  Now what are they doing?
[02:13:15.809 --> 02:13:17.790]  They're actually modifying the DNA.
[02:13:18.510 --> 02:13:21.214]  Recombinant modified vaccines.
[02:13:21.214 --> 02:13:27.082]  Vectored vaccines designed to produce non-infectious viruses or virus-like particles.
[02:13:27.082 --> 02:13:31.448]  So they're going in and genetically modifying the DNA of these
[02:13:32.515 --> 02:13:41.204]  Back of these viruses like Ebola, or as Daily Mail points out, also with cancer, also with the flu, also with HIV.
[02:13:41.204 --> 02:13:46.850]  So they're going in and genetically modifying these things and saying, well, you know, they won't make you sick.
[02:13:46.850 --> 02:13:53.497]  They'll just kind of look like it and then you will develop an active immunity against these diseases.
[02:13:54.458 --> 02:13:56.839]  Well, you know what could go wrong.
[02:13:56.839 --> 02:14:11.123]  You know that once they modify these things, it might be very much like what they're doing when they bring these diseases into the United States at the CDC, and they do what they call gain-of-function experiments on them.
[02:14:11.123 --> 02:14:17.385]  They try to make these deadly viruses, as they did with the one that escaped the lab down in Tulane, and they still don't know how it got out of the primate lab there.
[02:14:18.100 --> 02:14:24.263]  Burkholderia Pseudomallei is a deadly disease that is not indigenous to America.
[02:14:24.263 --> 02:14:29.406]  It was limited to a very, very small area of the world, primarily just in one country.
[02:14:29.406 --> 02:14:41.773]  They brought it to the United States, along with a lot of these other things that they then use gain-of-function research to try to make these things A, more deadly, and B, more easily contagious.
[02:14:41.773 --> 02:14:43.594]  And then they work on vaccines at the same time.
[02:14:45.182 --> 02:14:46.182]  How convenient.
[02:14:46.182 --> 02:14:55.507]  Now what they're doing right now is they're making artificial DNA changes and artificial approximations of cancer, Ebola, flu and HIV.
[02:14:55.507 --> 02:15:03.511]  They're doing that as vaccines because of course if they inject you with that and it isn't safe, they don't have any liability.
[02:15:04.588 --> 02:15:15.556]  And we should also understand that even when they use weakened real viruses or dead real viruses, they don't always get the response that they want.
[02:15:15.556 --> 02:15:18.999]  Remember this article from back in March 26 this year.
[02:15:18.999 --> 02:15:21.741]  Students contract whooping cough at a school that had a 99.5% vaccination rate.
[02:15:21.741 --> 02:15:22.161]  That's why I say,
[02:15:25.023 --> 02:15:26.985]  Heard immunity is nonsense.
[02:15:26.985 --> 02:15:28.446]  It's something they just made up.
[02:15:28.446 --> 02:15:30.127]  People are getting sick of this.
[02:15:30.127 --> 02:15:32.970]  They're getting sick of losing their informed consent.
[02:15:32.970 --> 02:15:37.614]  Even medical professionals, or I should say especially medical professionals, who know better.
[02:15:37.614 --> 02:15:39.535]  Listen to this article from the
[02:15:40.516 --> 02:15:42.638]  Vent, the Event Chronicle.
[02:15:42.638 --> 02:15:48.203]  And this is 22,000 nurses who are refusing to submit to mandatory vaccines.
[02:15:48.203 --> 02:15:50.705]  And we need to get these people on and talk to them.
[02:15:50.705 --> 02:15:55.469]  This is an organization called Nurses Against Mandatory Vaccines.
[02:15:55.469 --> 02:15:56.430]  N-A-M-V.
[02:15:56.430 --> 02:15:58.592]  Nurses Against Mandatory Vaccines.
[02:15:58.592 --> 02:16:05.418]  It was founded and formed because they were alarmed when they saw mandatory vaccination policies being introduced into the workplace.
[02:16:05.418 --> 02:16:05.778]  I think so.
[02:16:29.386 --> 02:16:39.014]  You see, that's one of the things that really galls me, is that so many of these people who are introducing these mandatory vaccines will say that they are pro-choice.
[02:16:39.014 --> 02:16:45.819]  And the only choice they would ever give anyone about anything in their life is whether or not to kill their child.
[02:16:45.819 --> 02:16:50.203]  Not about whether or not to vaccinate their child, not how their child would be educated,
[02:16:51.187 --> 02:16:55.632]  Nothing else in your life do they want you to have a choice, to have a decision, except that.
[02:16:55.632 --> 02:16:57.594]  And of course you know what they're going to be pushing you for.
[02:16:57.594 --> 02:17:10.687]  But they point out, hospital systems are required to have a 90% or higher flu shot reception rate amongst their staff or they lose up to 2% of their funding of Medicaid and Medicare.
[02:17:10.687 --> 02:17:12.348]  Well now that's interesting, isn't it?
[02:17:12.348 --> 02:17:14.511]  Because we had this story that was up
[02:17:16.252 --> 02:17:26.956]  On April the 13th, Don Salazar had this on InfoWars, there was a nursing student who had filed a lawsuit claiming that the college instructed them to threaten patients into receiving vaccines.
[02:17:26.956 --> 02:17:36.458]  Now one of the things that they were told if the patients didn't want to get their vaccine shots, they told them, tell them that you will lose your Medicaid if you don't get vaccinated.
[02:17:36.458 --> 02:17:40.680]  And if you lose your Medicaid, you will have to pay for your entire hospital stay.
[02:17:41.480 --> 02:17:44.061]  See, that's where they're getting this from.
[02:17:44.061 --> 02:17:46.302]  They are taking Medicaid and Medicare.
[02:17:46.302 --> 02:17:55.205]  The government is withholding that up to 2% if they don't get 90% or more of their staff vaccinated.
[02:17:55.205 --> 02:18:02.727]  So then the staff looks at this and says, hey, we can lie to the patients and tell them that they will lose all their Medicaid coverage if they don't get vaccinated.
[02:18:02.727 --> 02:18:04.808]  Well, that's not true right now.
[02:18:04.808 --> 02:18:05.268]  But you wait.
[02:18:06.075 --> 02:18:12.580]  They're going to make it come true, just like when that guy here in Austin says, oh, you see your sign there about banning firearms?
[02:18:12.580 --> 02:18:16.443]  Well, that's not true right now, but you hang on to that sign because it will become true.
[02:18:16.443 --> 02:18:20.126]  Yeah, they are going to start using that kind of leverage.
[02:18:20.126 --> 02:18:23.289]  We see this in Australia and New Zealand where they are taking
[02:18:24.659 --> 02:18:27.902]  Welfare benefits from people who are on poor families.
[02:18:27.902 --> 02:18:30.884]  They're taking that away if they don't get their kids vaccinated.
[02:18:30.884 --> 02:18:35.188]  We also see kids getting kicked out of school in Washington State.
[02:18:35.188 --> 02:18:36.189]  Spokane, Washington.
[02:18:36.189 --> 02:18:44.235]  150 public school students in Spokane, Washington have been booted from school for lacking documentation to prove that they were vaccinated.
[02:18:44.235 --> 02:18:49.600]  They say the kids could not come back to class unless they get their shots or a state-approved waiver.
[02:18:49.600 --> 02:18:50.521]  Why should I ever
[02:18:51.041 --> 02:18:56.686]  We have to have a state-approved waiver for whether or not my kids have been vaccinated.
[02:18:56.686 --> 02:19:06.674]  And of course, they say that they think this might even be bigger because they might have over 900 students in the district who have imperfect immunization records.
[02:19:06.674 --> 02:19:12.578]  Yeah, we're going to have to take more vaccines if we can't prove to them that we've had our vaccines.
[02:19:12.578 --> 02:19:16.482]  This is a very, very dangerous slippery slope.
[02:19:16.482 --> 02:19:17.723]  If they can treat you like this,
[02:19:18.573 --> 02:19:20.054]  They can do anything to you.
[02:19:20.054 --> 02:19:23.995]  If they can force you to take medical treatment, they can take all of your rights.
[02:19:23.995 --> 02:19:26.076]  And of course, they are taking all of our rights.
[02:19:26.076 --> 02:19:32.538]  The only reason they're coming for this one right now is because they have pretty much taken everything else that we have.
[02:19:32.538 --> 02:19:35.279]  This is one of the few rights that we still have.
[02:19:35.279 --> 02:19:36.420]  But when people stand up,
[02:19:37.040 --> 02:19:42.887]  We are seeing over and over again that the senators who have introduced these bills are withdrawing them.
[02:19:42.887 --> 02:19:47.713]  If you educate each other about what's at risk here, you can keep your freedom.
[02:19:47.713 --> 02:19:48.254]  Stay with us.
[02:19:48.254 --> 02:19:49.135]  We're going to be right back.
[02:19:49.135 --> 02:19:50.076]  We're going to take your calls.
[02:19:50.076 --> 02:19:50.116]  800-259-9231.
[02:19:58.985 --> 02:20:00.227]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:20:00.227 --> 02:20:04.713]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[02:20:04.713 --> 02:20:10.420]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold before your retirement.
[02:20:10.420 --> 02:20:13.785]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[02:20:13.965 --> 02:20:16.666]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[02:20:16.666 --> 02:20:21.667]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[02:20:21.667 --> 02:20:23.908]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:20:23.908 --> 02:20:28.449]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[02:20:28.449 --> 02:20:32.310]  Who has over 65 seed varieties of 34 different vegetables?
[02:20:32.310 --> 02:20:33.011]  Down to Earth!
[02:20:33.011 --> 02:20:37.352]  Who has over 63,000 seeds packaged to last 50 years?

[02:21:01.440 --> 02:21:11.167]  And it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and help children focus.
[02:21:11.167 --> 02:21:13.889]  All of our children are hit with modern mind control.
[02:21:13.889 --> 02:21:17.452]  Television, music, fast food, GMOs, sugars, you name it.
[02:21:17.452 --> 02:21:23.757]  Young humans have not yet developed their nervous system and are being hammered daily by globulous concoctions.
[02:21:23.757 --> 02:21:26.299]  It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down.
[02:21:26.479 --> 02:21:28.881]  And then are put on dangerous psychotropic drugs.
[02:21:28.881 --> 02:21:35.265]  Working with my team, we set out to find the best formula with the highest quality ingredients that children would actually like and take.
[02:21:35.265 --> 02:21:43.010]  We worked with the leading manufacturer in nutritional supplements that are safe for children to bring you the most affordable and powerful calming formula out there.
[02:21:43.010 --> 02:21:50.554]  Introducing ChildEase with herbs and calming extracts like chamomile and lemon balm and essential nutrients that taste great.

[02:23:00.850 --> 02:23:02.751]  Envy, the self-titled senior.
[02:23:02.751 --> 02:23:06.953]  We all live in a world today where things aren't what they seem.
[02:23:06.953 --> 02:23:10.455]  And if you think the news is real, you're living in a dream.
[02:23:10.455 --> 02:23:14.417]  Politicians don't run too deep to fight for you and me.

[02:24:15.000 --> 02:24:16.181]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:24:16.181 --> 02:24:18.842]  I'm David Knight, and we're going to be taking your calls in this segment.
[02:24:18.842 --> 02:24:22.944]  We've got people lined up to talk to us about the Trans-Pacific Partnership we've been talking about.
[02:24:22.944 --> 02:24:25.446]  Also, vaccines, martial law.
[02:24:25.446 --> 02:24:29.548]  If you want to call, it's 800-259-9231.
[02:24:29.548 --> 02:24:31.209]  Let's go to Tim in Florida.
[02:24:31.209 --> 02:24:34.170]  Tim, you said you wanted to talk about these free trade agreements.
[02:24:34.170 --> 02:24:35.431]  Go ahead.
[02:24:35.431 --> 02:24:36.932]  Hello, David.
[02:24:36.932 --> 02:24:38.913]  Thanks for taking my call, and you're doing a great job.
[02:24:39.432 --> 02:24:42.654]  I agree with much of what you're saying about TPP.
[02:24:42.654 --> 02:24:46.015]  I disagree with a bit of the rhetoric, though.
[02:24:46.015 --> 02:24:51.558]  Certainly, TPP is a major step toward a global corporate government.
[02:24:51.558 --> 02:24:56.400]  But a monolithic world government is not what TPP will bring in the near term.
[02:24:56.400 --> 02:24:57.421]  Oh, it's true, yeah.
[02:24:57.421 --> 02:25:03.264]  It's a major, major step, and it only has us, I think, about a half step to one step away from it.
[02:25:03.264 --> 02:25:04.284]  Go ahead.
[02:25:04.284 --> 02:25:04.664]  Right.
[02:25:04.664 --> 02:25:07.906]  Well, I would compare TPP to the mortar in a block wall.
[02:25:08.857 --> 02:25:12.359]  The mortar doesn't replace or supersede the blocks.
[02:25:12.359 --> 02:25:17.362]  It's designed to adhere the blocks, strengthen them, and lock them in.
[02:25:17.362 --> 02:25:21.544]  The world's regional blocks like NAFTA, they're not going to go away any time soon.
[02:25:21.544 --> 02:25:26.887]  I believe they're going to be the administrative branches of the world order if they get what they want done.
[02:25:26.887 --> 02:25:30.529]  But TPP is an inter-regional agreement involving four different regions.
[02:25:31.109 --> 02:25:37.734]  But except for NAFTA, the other three blocks involved only have several nations from each region participating.
[02:25:37.734 --> 02:25:39.215]  So here's what will happen.
[02:25:39.215 --> 02:25:47.220]  Those few nations will have to take the TPP template of regulations and commitments back to their respective regional blocks.
[02:25:47.220 --> 02:25:52.824]  And those commitments will then have to form the basis for further negotiations to integrate their own blocks.
[02:25:52.824 --> 02:25:53.944]  They will be committed to them.
[02:25:53.944 --> 02:25:55.986]  They'll have to insist that they be implemented.
[02:25:56.599 --> 02:26:01.768]  In the case of NAFTA, I've got a video of Mexico's ambassador to the U.S.
[02:26:01.768 --> 02:26:07.357]  at the time, Arturo Sorocan, who said that since all three NAFTA nations are in TPP,
[02:26:08.320 --> 02:26:11.263]  That it will be a backdoor means to strengthen NAFTA.
[02:26:11.263 --> 02:26:13.186]  It won't supersede or replace NAFTA.
[02:26:13.186 --> 02:26:17.831]  We're not taking that jump to a monolithic world government.
[02:26:17.831 --> 02:26:20.874]  The blocks are going to have an integral part of this.
[02:26:20.874 --> 02:26:21.435]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:26:21.435 --> 02:26:22.196]  I agree.
[02:26:22.196 --> 02:26:29.504]  And I think it's interesting that here we are 20 years in, as they're going to another level of this, that they're finally admitting
[02:26:30.024 --> 02:26:43.158]  That NAFTA was about sovereignty all along, about unity, and previously they would only talk about that within their meetings of the Bilderberg Group or within the studies that they did at the Council on Foreign Relations like the one I mentioned ten years ago.
[02:26:43.158 --> 02:26:48.724]  But I think, you know, when you're talking about this only being a few nations that are involved that they'll have to do this individually,
[02:26:49.565 --> 02:26:50.085]  Take a look at
[02:27:05.657 --> 02:27:05.737]  Yeah.
[02:27:25.130 --> 02:27:30.753]  There, who has basically made its name by pushing back against this loss of sovereignty.
[02:27:30.753 --> 02:27:45.880]  So, the Conservative Party, under James Cameron, is trying to take away some of that support by saying, we're going to press for a renegotiation of the original European Union Treaty, and then the European Union Commission President says, you're not going to get to vote on that for another four years.
[02:27:46.400 --> 02:27:48.523]  Which is something that he doesn't have the authority to say.
[02:27:48.523 --> 02:27:56.673]  So you've already got a European Commission president who is usurping the authority that he had under the original treaty to shut down any changes to the treaty.
[02:27:56.673 --> 02:27:57.795]  What's your comments on that, Tim?
[02:27:58.653 --> 02:28:00.054]  I agree with you, David, on that.
[02:28:00.054 --> 02:28:07.080]  Europe is leading the way, but some of these other regions are lagging behind, and that's what TPP is designed to do.
[02:28:07.080 --> 02:28:13.846]  Now, I don't know, David, I had a video in the Infobores contest several years ago.
[02:28:13.846 --> 02:28:16.248]  I have an update to that.
[02:28:16.248 --> 02:28:21.913]  I wish you guys would watch it and focus on these regions.
[02:28:21.913 --> 02:28:23.835]  Was that the one trading blocks, sir?
[02:28:24.673 --> 02:28:25.393]  Blockheads.
[02:28:25.393 --> 02:28:26.414]  Blockheads, yes.
[02:28:26.414 --> 02:28:27.614]  That was a very good one.
[02:28:27.614 --> 02:28:29.395]  Yeah, we need to repost that.
[02:28:29.395 --> 02:28:34.397]  It wasn't a great videographic masterpiece, but I had a lot of great information in it.
[02:28:34.397 --> 02:28:45.301]  I've got an update that I'd like you guys to consider, and consider focusing on these regions more, because it's really where it's at, and people are looking at it.
[02:28:45.301 --> 02:28:50.523]  I've got an update called Global Shakedown, ISIS, Ukraine, and the New Cold War.
[02:28:51.655 --> 02:28:58.810]  And it will show the role of these regional blocks, all of them, how they are going to form the basis of this thing.
[02:28:58.810 --> 02:29:01.476]  And they're going to be around for a while and be part of this process.
[02:29:01.832 --> 02:29:04.714]  Global structure, I'm sure.
[02:29:04.714 --> 02:29:06.295]  Well, yeah, I'd like to take a look at it.
[02:29:06.295 --> 02:29:22.467]  We'll take a look at that, and people should go back and look at blockheads, because that really does a great job of breaking down how they would consolidate these different regional areas, and then gradually, after they get regional consolidation, they would move to a larger consolidation.
[02:29:22.467 --> 02:29:24.308]  We're going to be right back with your calls.
[02:29:24.308 --> 02:29:28.951]  Stay there, Stephan, in New York, as well as Richard in Arizona, Jerry in LA.
[02:29:28.951 --> 02:29:30.752]  We're going to be right back with your calls.
[02:29:30.752 --> 02:29:31.153]  Stay with us.
[02:29:47.992 --> 02:29:50.977]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:50.977 --> 02:29:54.582]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:58.903 --> 02:30:03.964]  We all know of the countless cases where young black men had drugs or guns planted on them by police.
[02:30:03.964 --> 02:30:08.365]  Now the tables have turned by former black police officer Jeffrey Walker from Daily Mail.
[02:30:08.365 --> 02:30:17.427]  A disgraced ex-police officer testifying against his drug squad colleagues acknowledged on Tuesday that he stole drug money, planted evidence, and lied on paperwork too many times to count.
[02:30:17.427 --> 02:30:22.988]  His victims, in his own words, were white college boy khaki pants types who were easy to intimidate.
[02:30:23.268 --> 02:30:27.070]  Now that Mr. Walker is out of a job, maybe he should try his hand at the DEA.
[02:30:27.070 --> 02:30:32.712]  Apparently having wild sex parties and accepting gifts from drug dealers and working with the Sinaloa cartel is no big deal.
[02:30:32.712 --> 02:30:47.818]  DEA head Michelle Leonhardt said, I can't fire, I can't recommend a penalty, when asked why she has not fired or revoked the security clearance of agents named in the March 2015 OIG report, which included an account of an agent hitting a prostitute in the face with a glass over a money dispute.
[02:30:48.098 --> 02:30:53.704]  So, Mr. Walker, you can probably get a job with the biggest drug dealers on Earth and continue your disreputable ways.
[02:30:53.704 --> 02:30:58.670]  Rob Dew reporting for InfoWars.com, InfoWars Nightly News, and PrisonPlanet.tv.

[02:33:10.828 --> 02:33:21.774]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:21.774 --> 02:33:22.915]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:22.915 --> 02:33:24.716]  I'm David Knight, your host today.
[02:33:24.716 --> 02:33:28.258]  We're talking to callers about the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
[02:33:28.258 --> 02:33:31.399]  We've also got some callers on hold about vaccines.
[02:33:31.399 --> 02:33:34.421]  We were just talking to one gentleman, Tim.
[02:33:34.421 --> 02:33:37.683]  He did an excellent job, I thought, when we had the Paul Revere contest.
[02:33:37.683 --> 02:33:39.344]  And that's why it is very important
[02:33:40.044 --> 02:33:50.632]  To get the information out there, you can always have a big effect yourself if you put out some information, if you take video of what's going on in your community, if you put together a documentary like Tim did.
[02:33:50.632 --> 02:33:51.893]  It was called Blockheads.
[02:33:51.893 --> 02:33:58.138]  It's a great way to fill in some background as to what's going on with these trade agreements.
[02:33:58.138 --> 02:34:00.340]  Again, we're trying to consolidate the North American Union.
[02:34:00.840 --> 02:34:01.500]  We're good to go.
[02:34:22.387 --> 02:34:27.811]  And if you don't understand what's going on at the border, then take a look at NAFTA.
[02:34:27.811 --> 02:34:37.258]  If you don't understand how we are losing our economic base, how we've lost 700,000 jobs, 61% of those in manufacturing, take a look at NAFTA.
[02:34:37.258 --> 02:34:47.645]  If you want to know why our deficit has been so large and growing for the last 20 some odd years that we've had NAFTA, then take a closer look at it.
[02:34:47.645 --> 02:34:51.048]  That is all going to be repeated, but even worse.
[02:34:51.728 --> 02:34:55.629]  And the trade agreements that are being negotiated now that have been fast-tracked.
[02:34:55.629 --> 02:34:58.310]  So, educate yourself about it, educate others about it.
[02:34:58.310 --> 02:35:01.211]  Let's talk to Stephen in New York about the trade agreement.
[02:35:01.211 --> 02:35:03.512]  Stephen, go ahead.
[02:35:03.512 --> 02:35:05.893]  Hey, how you doing Dave?
[02:35:05.893 --> 02:35:06.673]  Always good seeing you.
[02:35:06.673 --> 02:35:08.234]  I mean, always good hearing you.
[02:35:08.234 --> 02:35:09.835]  You have a great voice.
[02:35:09.835 --> 02:35:11.835]  You sound like you'd be on a 10-10 win.
[02:35:11.835 --> 02:35:14.136]  But, the point is this.
[02:35:14.136 --> 02:35:19.198]  Wouldn't you say that between the trade agreement and between the real kingpins that
[02:35:20.168 --> 02:35:22.730]  The real players that are making this happen.
[02:35:22.730 --> 02:35:25.273]  I just want to voice an analysis here.
[02:35:25.273 --> 02:35:36.002]  Maybe you could tell me what you think, but wouldn't you say that this is really just a gigantic, if you were to look at this whole thing in a bird's eye view, it looks to me just like a gigantic hedge fund.
[02:35:36.002 --> 02:35:46.292]  Now, I know you're pretty business savvy and you can somewhat understand that it's really like between Soros and between, you know, all the real major players, it's just,
[02:35:47.071 --> 02:35:50.873]  It's really just maybe a thousand man hedge fund.
[02:35:50.873 --> 02:35:53.674]  And that's pretty much what we're waging war against.
[02:35:53.674 --> 02:36:00.298]  I mean, you can say that it's, you know, it's the tyranny that we're up against or it's, you know, whatever forces you want to call it.
[02:36:00.298 --> 02:36:04.100]  But the way I see it is it's a hedge fund that we're up against.
[02:36:04.100 --> 02:36:08.242]  And I was just thinking, how, how do people bring down hedge funds?
[02:36:08.863 --> 02:36:11.324]  Maybe if we can look at it from another angle.
[02:36:11.324 --> 02:36:14.525]  I mean, don't get me wrong, your angle is always, you know, on point.
[02:36:14.525 --> 02:36:26.068]  I'm not saying to change your angle, but I was just thinking maybe looking at this as breaking down a hedge fund and maybe that might give us some new answers in how we can counter this whole thing.
[02:36:26.068 --> 02:36:27.429]  It's a truly bad counterattack.
[02:36:27.429 --> 02:36:31.350]  I feel like nobody's like we're talking about it, which is good.
[02:36:32.148 --> 02:36:36.071]  Uh, to a point I feel like we're just, you know, in a sewing circle, just, you know, talking about it.
[02:36:36.071 --> 02:36:38.232]  No one's really countering them, you know what I mean?
[02:36:38.232 --> 02:36:39.373]  We actually have no reason to.
[02:36:39.373 --> 02:36:40.814]  Well, you know, I don't know what we do.
[02:36:40.814 --> 02:36:42.015]  I mean, part of it is education.
[02:36:42.015 --> 02:36:44.877]  I think we stopped the war in Syria when we educated people about it.
[02:36:45.450 --> 02:36:53.692]  And I think we basically didn't have to go to war with the ATF in this country because we educated people about what their gun control agenda is.
[02:36:53.692 --> 02:37:09.597]  And so now we see that by two to one margin, people are more interested in using the Second Amendment and seeing it as a means of protecting themselves than being afraid of it and embracing gun control because somehow if the government is the only one with guns, then we're going to be safe.
[02:37:10.217 --> 02:37:13.320]  So we won that argument through education.
[02:37:13.320 --> 02:37:14.541]  It's been done peacefully.
[02:37:14.541 --> 02:37:20.767]  And of course, how do we take down a syndicate like this that can control the markets?
[02:37:20.767 --> 02:37:22.729]  Because that's what the central bankers do.
[02:37:22.729 --> 02:37:25.211]  That's what the multinational corporations do.
[02:37:25.211 --> 02:37:26.532]  They can control the markets.
[02:37:26.532 --> 02:37:29.435]  And when you go back to the Federal Reserve, when it was first put in place,
[02:37:29.915 --> 02:37:31.657]  You go back to some of the people who spoke against it.
[02:37:31.657 --> 02:37:36.302]  I think it was Charles Lindbergh's father, who was a senator or congressman at the time.
[02:37:36.302 --> 02:37:41.527]  And he said, what you're doing is you're putting in place a system where these people can control the markets.
[02:37:41.527 --> 02:37:47.352]  They will know precisely when they are going to make business conditions favorable or less favorable.
[02:37:47.352 --> 02:37:49.014]  They'll be able to time the market.
[02:37:49.014 --> 02:37:51.396]  They will be able to precipitate crashes.
[02:37:52.057 --> 02:37:53.739]  And of course, that's exactly what we have.
[02:37:53.739 --> 02:38:04.012]  And if we let this go through, we are going to be allowing these multinational corporations to be elevated to the position of being sovereign states.
[02:38:04.012 --> 02:38:05.734]  Actually, greater than sovereign states.
[02:38:05.734 --> 02:38:08.898]  They'll be able to go in, in an arbitration process.
[02:38:09.338 --> 02:38:23.884]  And they'll say, well, you know, you just outlawed Monsanto's glyphosates, so Monsanto can sue you under this trade agreement for damages and your taxpayers or your sovereign government will have to pay for it and go into debt to the bankers.
[02:38:23.884 --> 02:38:30.847]  I think, really, Stephen, the best thing we can do is try to get people to understand what this is about.
[02:38:31.187 --> 02:38:46.484]  Not only is it just about economics, you know, there's a lot of people in the Democrat Party, their traditional constituents and unions, who are complaining very loudly about this, but most of the people who are in the Republican Party see this as, falsely I believe, as a free trade agreement.
[02:38:47.305 --> 02:38:50.167]  I'm all for free markets, but this is not a free market.
[02:38:50.167 --> 02:38:51.728]  This is not a free market agreement.
[02:38:51.728 --> 02:38:53.029]  This is nothing of the sort.
[02:38:53.029 --> 02:39:01.055]  This is crony capitalism, and I think a lot of people in the Tea Party and elsewhere woke up to the idea that crony capitalism is not capitalism.
[02:39:01.055 --> 02:39:07.020]  Crony capitalism is not a free market, and they need to understand that these trade agreements that are being negotiated right now
[02:39:07.780 --> 02:39:22.371]  Are very different animals and free trade agreements and they're far more comprehensive than just trade so I don't know when you're talking about trying to take down a hedge fund I'm really not sure what what we would do along that line but I think it's really more of an educational issue.
[02:39:22.371 --> 02:39:23.932]  Do you have anything else that you would add to that?
[02:39:25.576 --> 02:39:28.137]  Um, I mean, after that, I'm not really.
[02:39:28.137 --> 02:39:30.798]  The only thing I was going to say is the jade health thing.
[02:39:30.798 --> 02:39:35.920]  What really stuck out to me is the fact that they want people to give them nuggets of information.
[02:39:35.920 --> 02:39:39.661]  I don't know what Afghani civilians would give U.S.
[02:39:39.661 --> 02:39:41.302]  troops nuggets of information.
[02:39:41.302 --> 02:39:42.803]  It just doesn't translate with me.
[02:39:42.803 --> 02:39:44.543]  But, uh, back to the hedge fund thing.
[02:39:44.543 --> 02:39:51.986]  The only reason I was calling it a hedge fund is because I see all these investors, like Soros, investing money into, you know, stir up riots.
[02:39:51.986 --> 02:39:54.527]  God knows who investing money to make this trade agreement happen.
[02:39:55.094 --> 02:40:01.318]  It seems to me just like a hedge fund, and like every hedge fund, there's a hedge fund operator.
[02:40:01.318 --> 02:40:02.559]  And who?
[02:40:02.559 --> 02:40:04.820]  There's probably not just one operating these strings.
[02:40:04.820 --> 02:40:06.881]  I mean, I don't know.
[02:40:06.881 --> 02:40:08.863]  Well, yeah, quite frankly, they are there.
[02:40:08.863 --> 02:40:11.084]  And it is really the market manipulation, of course.
[02:40:11.084 --> 02:40:17.408]  It's not just making money if it goes down, like, you know, protecting themselves against the loss of making money if it goes down.
[02:40:18.088 --> 02:40:21.850]  They can make money if it goes up, because they can control which direction it's going to go.
[02:40:21.850 --> 02:40:24.431]  And that's the key thing to understand about these people.
[02:40:24.431 --> 02:40:26.852]  And we need to back that kind of concentration.
[02:40:26.852 --> 02:40:32.234]  You want to know why you're getting a 1% of a 1% of a 1% with all the money?
[02:40:32.234 --> 02:40:33.754]  Go back and look at these trade agreements.
[02:40:33.754 --> 02:40:36.415]  That's really what is setting this up.
[02:40:36.415 --> 02:40:37.996]  Let's go to Richard in Arizona.
[02:40:37.996 --> 02:40:39.937]  Richard, you said you want to talk about vaccines.
[02:40:39.937 --> 02:40:41.197]  Thank you, Stephan.
[02:40:41.197 --> 02:40:43.438]  Let's go to Richard.
[02:40:43.438 --> 02:40:44.578]  Hi, David.
[02:40:44.578 --> 02:40:45.599]  Am I coming through okay?
[02:40:45.599 --> 02:40:45.739]  Yeah.
[02:40:47.463 --> 02:40:58.788]  Okay, I've been a really strong supporter of InfoWars for 20 years or so, and I have to correct you on something, and I hope that you will pass it on to Alex also.
[02:40:58.788 --> 02:40:59.809]  Okay, sure.
[02:40:59.809 --> 02:41:06.052]  Once in a while, InfoWars is inadvertently giving out some information that's not correct.
[02:41:06.052 --> 02:41:11.534]  And in this case, it's about vaccine, and this is something I know a lot about.
[02:41:11.534 --> 02:41:15.096]  And when Jenner started it out,
[02:41:15.805 --> 02:41:19.027]  There were no adjuvants being put in the vaccine.
[02:41:19.027 --> 02:41:32.816]  And if you look at the history, not from a government source, but from a real source, and I have some of those, you find that the vaccines were starting and spreading epidemics in the beginning and they killed a lot of people and there were no adjuvants.
[02:41:32.816 --> 02:41:40.901]  So this idea that the theory is unquestionable and that clean vaccines would be great is seriously flawed and it's not true.
[02:41:40.901 --> 02:41:44.744]  And then when you look at the history of the next several hundred years through Europe,
[02:41:46.032 --> 02:41:52.138]  Vaccines were banned many times before adjuvants even started, and the reason they were banned is because it killed people.
[02:41:52.138 --> 02:42:06.871]  And the fact that these little things in the bloodstream, which they arbitrarily call antibodies, show up when the body tries to defend itself against this kind of assault, which is not how it gets immunity in nature, not what it's programmed for.
[02:42:06.871 --> 02:42:10.414]  They assume that that means there's unity, but we know
[02:42:11.434 --> 02:42:18.337]  People are getting these diseases, including measles and everything else, with lots of antibodies, and they get them right after they get the shot.
[02:42:18.337 --> 02:42:23.359]  And they also have great immunity in many people that have no antibodies.
[02:42:23.359 --> 02:42:25.499]  So that theory is seriously questionable.
[02:42:25.499 --> 02:42:33.022]  And when you look at what Pasteur originally said with his germ theory of disease, he actually was not the originator of it.
[02:42:33.022 --> 02:42:34.803]  He stole it from somebody named Beauchamp.
[02:42:35.433 --> 02:42:41.956]  And both of them recanted that disease before they died when it was too late and it was taking off as an industry.
[02:42:41.956 --> 02:42:49.079]  And they said, basically, in short term, the germs are nothing, the terrain is everything.
[02:42:49.079 --> 02:42:53.280]  In other words, the germs are attracted to where there's degeneration going on.
[02:42:53.280 --> 02:42:57.002]  And they may have toxic byproducts, but they weren't the original cause.
[02:42:57.002 --> 02:43:02.844]  So the whole theory of it, and the idea that if it was clean it would be legitimate, is completely bogus.
[02:43:02.844 --> 02:43:05.065]  And nobody is willing to say that publicly.
[02:43:05.745 --> 02:43:07.307]  Yeah, I don't disagree with you.
[02:43:07.307 --> 02:43:13.854]  I haven't researched that as thoroughly as you have to say that I wouldn't go with any active immunity.
[02:43:13.854 --> 02:43:25.707]  I will say this, that that's going to be a much, much harder sell to get people to understand that than to get them to understand that dangerous things are being added to the vaccines that in and of themselves
[02:43:26.247 --> 02:43:27.107]  Can cause problems.
[02:43:27.107 --> 02:43:28.068]  People can understand that.
[02:43:28.068 --> 02:43:30.148]  They can understand harmful additives to their food.
[02:43:30.148 --> 02:43:31.609]  That's why they buy organic.
[02:43:31.609 --> 02:43:35.530]  That's why organic is surging in the marketplace.
[02:43:35.530 --> 02:43:37.971]  They can understand that preservatives are dangerous.
[02:43:37.971 --> 02:43:42.552]  They can understand that injecting people with aluminum is dangerous.
[02:43:42.552 --> 02:43:45.193]  So it's easier, I think, to get people to understand that.
[02:43:45.193 --> 02:43:47.694]  It's also, I think, easier to focus on the fact
[02:43:48.374 --> 02:43:57.540]  That we need to have decisions, we need to be the ones to make decisions about our life, especially, especially about what we have in terms of medical treatment.
[02:43:57.540 --> 02:44:03.064]  That if we don't have that capability, we truly are in a dangerous slave situation.
[02:44:03.064 --> 02:44:04.665]  So that's what I've tried to focus on.
[02:44:04.665 --> 02:44:10.049]  I know there are people who have a lot of issues with vaccines per se, and I don't dispute that.
[02:44:10.049 --> 02:44:12.470]  I haven't researched that as much as you have.
[02:44:12.470 --> 02:44:17.774]  I will just say that we need to focus on the idea that you don't force people
[02:44:18.314 --> 02:44:20.015]  to get any kind of medical treatment.
[02:44:20.015 --> 02:44:22.655]  It's one of the reasons why I oppose fluoride.
[02:44:22.655 --> 02:44:25.796]  How can you force people, force Medicaid people in the water supply?
[02:44:25.796 --> 02:44:27.237]  How could you ever justify that?
[02:44:27.237 --> 02:44:31.178]  First of all, you can't even control the dosage when you dump it into the water supply.
[02:44:31.178 --> 02:44:38.680]  But who gives you the right, government, to force medical treatment on people to say that we have determined that this is for your own good?
[02:44:38.680 --> 02:44:39.981]  We should have had this discussion
[02:44:40.641 --> 02:44:58.960]  From that perspective with fluoride I think a long time ago to say that you're not going to force medical treatment on me and now what we see is that this kind of leverage is being used on people in terms of your kids can't come to school and as Joe Jennings just pointed out hey if your kids are truant they're eventually going to come after you and put you in jail if you don't get these kids vaccinated.
[02:44:58.960 --> 02:45:00.462]  That's the ultimate leverage that they've got.
[02:45:00.782 --> 02:45:05.808]  Or going to poor families that are on welfare and saying, we're going to withhold your welfare payments unless you do this.
[02:45:05.808 --> 02:45:12.897]  Or blackmailing hospitals and saying that unless you vaccinate all of your staff, you're not going to get Medicaid or Medicare.
[02:45:12.897 --> 02:45:19.526]  There's so many ways that they can hold a gun to our head, and I think we really need to focus on the civil liberties aspect.
[02:45:20.006 --> 02:45:30.708]  And then we can, once people have established, once we've established and made safe again, the right that we have informed consent, then we can have a real discussion about every aspect of vaccines.
[02:45:30.708 --> 02:45:32.328]  And I think we do need to have that discussion.
[02:45:32.328 --> 02:45:33.709]  Was there anything else you wanted to add to that, Richard?
[02:45:50.773 --> 02:45:51.254]  I've looked.
[02:45:51.254 --> 02:45:56.979]  There's no validity to the basic theory of vaccination, and I know that's taboo to say.
[02:45:56.979 --> 02:46:10.872]  Now, the thing about free trade is that the only purpose of the free trade agreements from NAFTA to the higher world agreements is to destroy national sovereignty and national economies to facilitate world government.
[02:46:10.872 --> 02:46:11.913]  I see nothing else.
[02:46:11.913 --> 02:46:16.237]  This is a huge red flag with Rand Paul and Ted Cruz.
[02:46:16.775 --> 02:46:17.756]  Yes, yes.
[02:46:17.756 --> 02:46:20.458]  I cannot understand why they are supporting that.
[02:46:20.458 --> 02:46:23.040]  And as you said, it is a huge red flag.
[02:46:23.040 --> 02:46:30.685]  They need to explain to people, and if we have people who are educated on the issue, understand what is really behind this, then we need to talk to them.
[02:46:30.685 --> 02:46:33.127]  Maybe, you know, they can give us an answer.
[02:46:33.127 --> 02:46:34.108]  Maybe they can explain it to me.
[02:46:34.108 --> 02:46:38.271]  I don't know how they justify it, but they need to justify that, because if they don't,
[02:46:39.171 --> 02:46:47.513]  All of the rest of this stuff could just be that they are some kind of a libertarian front to try to get somebody's support for this.
[02:46:47.513 --> 02:46:49.993]  I think we're not going to fix it by sending somebody to Washington anyway.
[02:46:49.993 --> 02:46:51.414]  I think it's got to be done outside.
[02:46:51.414 --> 02:46:53.974]  I think Washington is too big, too corrupt.
[02:46:53.974 --> 02:46:55.574]  It needs to be shut down from the outside.
[02:46:55.574 --> 02:46:56.455]  It needs to be contained.
[02:46:56.455 --> 02:46:59.175]  It's like some kind of a cancer that needs to be contained.
[02:46:59.175 --> 02:46:59.735]  Thank you, Richard.
[02:46:59.735 --> 02:47:01.176]  Let's go to Mark in California.
[02:47:01.176 --> 02:47:02.496]  Mark, you said you want to talk about Jade Helm.
[02:47:04.787 --> 02:47:05.887]  Hey, David.
[02:47:05.887 --> 02:47:07.008]  Doing a great job, by the way.
[02:47:07.008 --> 02:47:10.989]  Yeah, I just got two quick points on Jade Helm.
[02:47:10.989 --> 02:47:13.609]  First, we know that they're lying to us.
[02:47:13.609 --> 02:47:20.771]  Obviously, coming from a veteran, whenever we train, we train for climate-specific.
[02:47:20.771 --> 02:47:23.432]  We train for terrain-specific.
[02:47:23.432 --> 02:47:30.934]  So, I mean, if they were going to train for a Middle Eastern engagement, they'd be training in the desert.
[02:47:31.932 --> 02:47:32.833]  Yes, absolutely.
[02:47:32.833 --> 02:47:40.937]  And they wouldn't be trying to move, they wouldn't be dressing in American civilian clothing and trying to move undetected amongst the American population.
[02:47:40.937 --> 02:47:43.679]  I mean, why would that be a challenge to them?
[02:47:43.679 --> 02:47:46.080]  And how would that possibly help them in another country?
[02:47:46.080 --> 02:48:00.289]  And of course we had the video that we put up on InfoWars from someone who went to the Dirty Bomb Drill in Richmond, California that showed them doing crowd control and having one of the role-playing actors yell, I'm a sovereign citizen,
[02:48:00.749 --> 02:48:01.729]  I don't have to listen to you.
[02:48:21.476 --> 02:48:22.436]  That's exactly what you said.
[02:48:22.436 --> 02:48:26.038]  We're going to train in the mountains, we're going to fight in the mountains, we're going to train in the desert, we're going to fight in the desert.
[02:48:26.038 --> 02:48:27.759]  So we train the way we're going to fight.
[02:48:27.759 --> 02:48:35.123]  And it's like, so why can't people understand that they're training with the police in L.A.
[02:48:35.123 --> 02:48:37.484]  to control civil unrest?
[02:48:37.484 --> 02:48:38.664]  Why can't they understand that?
[02:48:38.664 --> 02:48:41.226]  I mean, like I said before, I've been in A.P.
[02:48:41.226 --> 02:48:42.326]  Hill with Biggs.
[02:48:42.326 --> 02:48:43.827]  We see how they've been training.
[02:48:43.827 --> 02:48:45.808]  We see that they work with the police.
[02:48:46.528 --> 02:48:52.572]  There isn't really any difference between a militarized police or using the military as police.
[02:48:52.572 --> 02:48:55.334]  I mean, those are both violations of posse comitatus.
[02:48:55.334 --> 02:48:57.435]  That's something that everybody needs to be concerned about.
[02:48:57.435 --> 02:49:00.097]  Go ahead, Mark.
[02:49:00.097 --> 02:49:02.018]  Also, I see you have video.
[02:49:02.018 --> 02:49:05.561]  Someone got a great video off the I-15 in California.
[02:49:05.561 --> 02:49:10.164]  It's on the road out to Vegas, and it's a pretty notorious area right by Barstow.
[02:49:11.088 --> 02:49:12.889]  And there is a huge buildup.
[02:49:12.889 --> 02:49:16.130]  The name of the video I sent to Showtips is Jade Helm.
[02:49:16.130 --> 02:49:18.191]  Huge buildup.
[02:49:18.191 --> 02:49:19.992]  But it's a video about 15 minutes.
[02:49:19.992 --> 02:49:29.836]  And there's not hundreds, but there are thousands of MRAPs, thousands of Humvees, thousands of ATCs, and they're staging.
[02:49:29.836 --> 02:49:31.076]  They're being staged for something.
[02:49:31.076 --> 02:49:33.797]  And this is not a rapid deployment base at all.
[02:49:33.797 --> 02:49:37.239]  I mean, they're being staged for something in California.
[02:49:37.239 --> 02:49:38.739]  Well, you know, and that's my concern.
[02:49:38.739 --> 02:49:39.940]  I said this before.
[02:49:40.800 --> 02:49:57.189]  I believe that this mad rush to try to get MRAPs and APCs into police departments, even into the smallest, most peaceful rural communities, pushing out all the stops to try to get these in, I think that is advanced placement to try to get these things in those areas.
[02:49:57.189 --> 02:50:04.613]  You're talking about something completely different, I understand, but I think even that is a pre-positioning of military assets into these areas.
[02:50:04.753 --> 02:50:17.677]  And I think it's very interesting to understand that it was just last summer that they shut down a 60-year-old program to provide that kind of equipment to rural fire departments because they wanted to get it in the hands of people who had arresting capability.
[02:50:17.677 --> 02:50:20.378]  That's exactly what they said in the Section 1033 program.
[02:50:20.378 --> 02:50:24.219]  They wanted to get it in the hands of people who had arresting power.
[02:50:24.219 --> 02:50:25.739]  So they would take it away from the firefighters.
[02:50:25.739 --> 02:50:27.840]  Nevertheless, they will tell you that this is there for
[02:50:28.400 --> 02:50:32.941]  Some kind of a, you know, a natural emergency or something like that.
[02:50:32.941 --> 02:50:34.601]  Simply don't buy it.
[02:50:34.601 --> 02:50:37.022]  Just like people don't buy what's going on with Walmart.
[02:50:37.022 --> 02:50:40.682]  There's something screwy about these Walmart closures.
[02:50:40.682 --> 02:50:42.142]  Everybody knows that they're lying to us.
[02:50:42.142 --> 02:50:44.803]  We don't know exactly at this point what the lie is.
[02:50:44.803 --> 02:50:48.864]  That's why people are starting to guess about it.
[02:50:48.864 --> 02:50:50.624]  But the same thing happens with the government.
[02:50:50.624 --> 02:50:53.905]  We know when they're lying to us and that's when we start doing the investigation.
[02:50:53.905 --> 02:50:54.345]  Stay with us.
[02:50:54.345 --> 02:50:55.365]  We're going to take more of your calls.
[02:50:55.365 --> 02:50:55.905]  We'll be right back.
[02:50:58.914 --> 02:51:05.603]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[02:51:05.603 --> 02:51:13.353]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[02:51:13.834 --> 02:51:21.878]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[02:51:21.878 --> 02:51:26.960]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[02:51:26.960 --> 02:51:32.183]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[02:51:32.183 --> 02:51:35.905]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[02:51:36.525 --> 02:51:37.606]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:51:37.606 --> 02:51:42.107]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[02:51:42.107 --> 02:51:47.009]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[02:51:47.009 --> 02:51:50.011]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[02:51:50.011 --> 02:51:51.791]  Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237.
[02:51:51.791 --> 02:51:52.011]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:51:58.334 --> 02:51:59.455]  Hi, I'm Alex Jones.
[02:51:59.455 --> 02:52:07.503]  When I got on air 20 years ago, I weighed 180 pounds, I lifted weights five days a week, I could swim two, three miles.
[02:52:07.503 --> 02:52:10.666]  Then I discovered the New World Order, the globalists, their agenda.
[02:52:10.666 --> 02:52:12.628]  I started an access television show.
[02:52:12.628 --> 02:52:18.014]  I was so dedicated to my work and hanging around with radio guys that I began drinking.
[02:52:18.014 --> 02:52:20.857]  I began smoking cigars and then even cigarettes.
[02:52:21.377 --> 02:52:27.439]  I transformed from looking like a white Bruce Lee to looking like a job of the hut.
[02:52:27.439 --> 02:52:32.700]  So I began a journey five years ago to shed the almost 100 pounds.
[02:52:32.700 --> 02:52:37.882]  I started taking super male vitality and saw dramatic results in just a few weeks.
[02:52:37.882 --> 02:52:39.302]  When I added to the mix,
[02:52:39.662 --> 02:52:43.865]  The key products developed by Dr. Group for InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:52:43.865 --> 02:52:45.286]  The results were incredible.
[02:52:45.286 --> 02:52:50.590]  Take the InfoWarsLife.com challenge today at InfoWarsLife.com or give our crew a call.

[02:53:25.094 --> 02:53:26.775]  Enhancing health and privacy.
[02:53:27.558 --> 02:53:31.940]  Measles is activating on a mass scale, now due to the vaccines and iron poisoning.
[02:53:31.940 --> 02:53:35.281]  All symptoms, disease and deaths are due to measles and iron.
[02:53:35.281 --> 02:53:38.582]  Not just rash and flu-like symptoms, as the officials claim.
[02:53:38.582 --> 02:53:41.043]  Measles requires a host with iron to replicate.
[02:53:41.043 --> 02:53:43.043]  Iron intake is at an unprecedented level.
[02:53:43.043 --> 02:53:47.605]  Deaths and hospitalizations are set to soar now in 2015.
[02:53:47.605 --> 02:53:49.385]  This is the extermination plan, people.
[02:53:49.385 --> 02:53:52.226]  For further information, go to unveilingthem.com.

[02:54:10.959 --> 02:54:12.339]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:54:12.339 --> 02:54:14.700]  I'm David Knight, and I'll be taking your calls this segment.
[02:54:14.700 --> 02:54:17.521]  We're going to try to get to Jerry, John, Omar, Daniel.
[02:54:17.521 --> 02:54:19.901]  If we can't make it through all you guys, we'll hang on.
[02:54:19.901 --> 02:54:21.902]  We'll take you into overdrive.
[02:54:21.902 --> 02:54:33.945]  The last call that we had was talking about a massive buildup of MRAPs, APCs, things like that, on Highway 15, California, kind of heading from California out to Vegas.
[02:54:34.885 --> 02:54:41.670]  And as Joe Jennings was talking about, he says he's driven down that highway many times because it's absolutely desolate.
[02:54:41.670 --> 02:54:45.072]  And if it's the route that I took from LA to Vegas, yeah, it is.
[02:54:45.072 --> 02:54:45.993]  There's nothing out there.
[02:54:45.993 --> 02:54:47.935]  So it's pretty interesting to see that clip.
[02:54:47.935 --> 02:54:51.917]  If that's the one that he was talking about, it seemed to be the one he was talking about.
[02:54:53.158 --> 02:55:00.103]  That's not too far from the area in Southern California that they showed as being part of the Jade Helm exercise.
[02:55:00.103 --> 02:55:03.546]  So, we're going to go back to your calls in just one moment.
[02:55:03.546 --> 02:55:09.650]  But first, I just want to let you know that we've got a sale right now of 50% off of InfoWars Silver Bullet.
[02:55:09.650 --> 02:55:11.492]  It's the biggest sale we've ever had of Silver Bullet.
[02:55:12.032 --> 02:55:14.673]  Save about $15 off of this.
[02:55:14.673 --> 02:55:15.393]  It's $14.95, usually $29.95.
[02:55:15.393 --> 02:55:19.394]  And again, that's our concentrated colloidal silver.
[02:55:19.394 --> 02:55:20.274]  30 parts per million.
[02:55:20.274 --> 02:55:22.134]  You can get that at Infowarslife.com.
[02:55:22.134 --> 02:55:25.195]  Of course, we also have specials on our water filters.

[02:55:32.497 --> 02:55:32.877]  Don't forget.
[02:55:33.457 --> 02:55:34.839]  Emergency food supplies.
[02:55:34.839 --> 02:55:38.502]  You should always have that as a backup because you never know what's going to happen.
[02:55:38.502 --> 02:55:42.685]  It could be political, it could be economic, it could be some kind of a natural disaster.
[02:55:42.685 --> 02:55:48.290]  So always make sure that you've got clean water and food that you can feed your family.
[02:55:48.290 --> 02:55:53.675]  You can find that there and support the operation as you provide for your own at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:55:53.675 --> 02:55:55.637]  Let's go to Jerry in LA.
[02:55:55.637 --> 02:55:58.439]  I'm sorry, Louisiana.
[02:55:58.439 --> 02:55:59.100]  But it's Louisiana.
[02:55:59.100 --> 02:55:59.881]  Jerry in Louisiana.
[02:55:59.881 --> 02:56:00.101]  Go ahead.
[02:56:01.072 --> 02:56:02.173]  Yeah, it's Indiana.
[02:56:02.173 --> 02:56:03.093]  Sorry, we had that problem.
[02:56:03.093 --> 02:56:03.354]  Oh, okay.
[02:56:03.354 --> 02:56:03.814]  Indiana.
[02:56:03.814 --> 02:56:05.615]  Okay, go ahead.
[02:56:05.615 --> 02:56:11.499]  In southern Indiana, 30 miles north of Louisville, Kentucky, there is an HIV outbreak.
[02:56:11.499 --> 02:56:16.823]  Governor Pence has already stated that it's a state of emergency for that county.
[02:56:16.823 --> 02:56:23.227]  Now, they've erected a brand new fence around the National Guard that you cannot see through now.
[02:56:23.227 --> 02:56:30.372]  But if you get up on top of a building, you can look in there and you can see anti-personnel armaments are building up with sound cannons.
[02:56:30.965 --> 02:56:32.446]  And water hoses.
[02:56:32.446 --> 02:56:41.271]  Now, the sheriff has leaked the information out that he's been taken out of power, that somebody's come in and took him away from his desk.
[02:56:41.271 --> 02:56:42.071]  Now, where is this?
[02:56:42.071 --> 02:56:42.912]  This is in Indiana.
[02:56:42.912 --> 02:56:44.713]  Tell me the city again.
[02:56:44.713 --> 02:56:45.734]  Scottsburg.
[02:56:45.734 --> 02:56:47.375]  Scott County, Indiana.
[02:56:47.375 --> 02:56:49.116]  Scottsburg.
[02:56:49.116 --> 02:56:53.238]  There was a story about it on AP yesterday, and today the story's gone.
[02:56:53.238 --> 02:56:54.259]  Huh.
[02:56:54.259 --> 02:56:57.000]  So it makes me think that they're blacking out the story.
[02:56:57.000 --> 02:56:57.260]  Wow.
[02:56:57.260 --> 02:56:59.141]  That was on the news, I think, Friday.
[02:56:59.141 --> 02:57:00.162]  It's my old hometown.
[02:57:00.856 --> 02:57:07.900]  Well, seven miles west, in a town called Maryville, there's supposedly a church Christian camp.
[02:57:07.900 --> 02:57:10.761]  But it has a 20-foot fence around it that you can't see through.
[02:57:10.761 --> 02:57:16.504]  And they just built an airport there, right inside that compound.
[02:57:16.504 --> 02:57:18.705]  They'll call it a compound, because that's what it is.
[02:57:18.705 --> 02:57:23.567]  They've created a huge concrete structure, and they're digging.
[02:57:23.567 --> 02:57:25.568]  I don't know what they're doing there, but they're digging.
[02:57:25.568 --> 02:57:26.789]  And there's an airport.
[02:57:27.341 --> 02:57:30.603]  Now, people have said that they're going to start marching the streets soon.
[02:57:30.603 --> 02:57:37.087]  It's already the CDC says it's a state of emergency, and the governor has declared a state of emergency.
[02:57:37.087 --> 02:57:39.869]  So the people are saying that it's going to be martial law.
[02:57:39.869 --> 02:57:43.571]  Did you say it was an HIV outbreak that they're saying?
[02:57:43.571 --> 02:57:45.272]  HIV outbreak, yes.
[02:57:45.272 --> 02:57:46.573]  AIDS outbreak.
[02:57:46.573 --> 02:57:48.314]  That's very unusual.
[02:57:48.314 --> 02:57:49.035]  That's very unusual.
[02:57:49.035 --> 02:57:50.476]  29 cases this year.
[02:57:51.414 --> 02:57:58.524]  Yeah, but still, I mean, that's not the sort of thing that's going to be so easily transmissible that they would set up some kind of a quarantine area.
[02:57:58.524 --> 02:57:59.265]  Right.
[02:57:59.265 --> 02:57:59.525]  Yeah.
[02:57:59.525 --> 02:58:00.106]  Right.
[02:58:00.106 --> 02:58:04.132]  Supposedly FEMA's been going around house to house asking questions.
[02:58:05.546 --> 02:58:07.867]  You know, do you have clean needles and things like that?
[02:58:07.867 --> 02:58:09.508]  They shut down the needle bank.
[02:58:09.508 --> 02:58:10.549]  Okay, we got it pulled up.
[02:58:10.549 --> 02:58:12.650]  Indiana governor extends public health emergency.
[02:58:12.650 --> 02:58:13.590]  Yeah, we see that there.
[02:58:13.590 --> 02:58:15.371]  We're gonna have to take a look at that.
[02:58:15.371 --> 02:58:16.252]  Thank you for pointing that out.
[02:58:16.252 --> 02:58:17.032]  I hadn't seen that.
[02:58:17.032 --> 02:58:17.432]  Stay with us.
[02:58:17.432 --> 02:58:18.733]  We're gonna come back in overdrive.
[02:58:18.733 --> 02:58:22.955]  Try to get to Jerry, John, Omar, and Daniel as quickly as well as we can.
[02:58:22.955 --> 02:58:23.596]  We'll be right back.
[02:58:41.480 --> 02:58:45.446]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[02:58:48.937 --> 02:58:53.319]  Use since before the days of the Roman Empire to support the body's natural systems.

[02:59:18.690 --> 02:59:19.711]  Alex Jones here.
[02:59:19.711 --> 02:59:28.997]  For the last two years, I've been working with top doctors, nutritionists, and chemists to design a nutraceutical formulation that has truly life-changing health benefits.
[02:59:28.997 --> 02:59:32.800]  Introducing the all-new Ancient Defense Herbal Immunity Blend.

[02:59:51.278 --> 03:00:01.541]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:01.541 --> 03:00:08.183]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:00:08.183 --> 03:00:11.164]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:15.478 --> 03:00:16.699]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:00:16.699 --> 03:00:20.820]  I'm David Knight, and we're going into overdrive, trying to take the callers who've been queued up here.
[03:00:20.820 --> 03:00:22.401]  Let's go to John in California.
[03:00:22.401 --> 03:00:24.762]  John?
[03:00:24.762 --> 03:00:25.542]  Hello, hi.
[03:00:25.542 --> 03:00:27.523]  Hey, go ahead, you're on.
[03:00:27.523 --> 03:00:37.187]  Um, yeah, Mr. Knight, I just want to say, um, I definitely appreciate your operation, but, um, at the same time, I definitely feel that, um, well, basically, I'll just give you a long story short.
[03:00:37.187 --> 03:00:39.548]  I've listened to you guys for about four or five years.
[03:00:39.548 --> 03:00:42.249]  I've been trying to make a, you know, sort of what's going on in the world.
[03:00:42.249 --> 03:00:43.829]  I'm 22 years old.
[03:00:43.829 --> 03:00:45.030]  I'm, you know, one of those, uh,
[03:00:45.666 --> 03:00:46.446]  We're good to go.
[03:01:06.516 --> 03:01:06.916]  I'm good to go.
[03:01:31.992 --> 03:01:34.793]  Uh, direct that conversation to a whole different, uh, thing.
[03:01:34.793 --> 03:01:43.456]  Because, for example, when, um, you definitely see, or you hear things like illegal immigrants, that definitely puts, uh, people off, uh, the whole conversation.
[03:01:43.456 --> 03:01:46.638]  Well, yeah, but that's, that's part of the, that's the idea.
[03:01:46.638 --> 03:01:49.899]  There are people who, who immigrate legally who go through the process.
[03:01:49.899 --> 03:01:55.101]  There's a backlog of about four million people right now, uh, that are, that are backlogged to try to come through the process.
[03:01:55.661 --> 03:02:00.846]  And so it's kind of like, you know, people getting upset if you're standing at a movie theater and somebody cuts ahead of you in the line.
[03:02:00.846 --> 03:02:02.908]  I mean, it's kind of that type of thing.
[03:02:02.908 --> 03:02:04.190]  We have a process.
[03:02:04.190 --> 03:02:08.734]  We have a limit as to how many people we can assimilate in the country at one point.
[03:02:08.734 --> 03:02:13.719]  And the real underlying problem of all this, of course, is the welfare state.
[03:02:13.719 --> 03:02:17.563]  We cannot have open immigration as long as we have an entitlement state.
[03:02:18.403 --> 03:02:32.526]  And it's essentially been recognized by social planners, Cloward and Piven, who put it out as a strategy to try to destroy the economy of the country so they could then rebuild it from the ashes into the socialist utopia that they wanted to see.
[03:02:32.526 --> 03:02:35.526]  So that's, John, what we're concerned about.
[03:02:35.526 --> 03:02:38.567]  It isn't that we have any issues with anybody from any particular country.
[03:02:38.567 --> 03:02:41.807]  And it's not just Mexicans who are coming through the central border.
[03:02:41.807 --> 03:02:45.448]  It's not just South Americans who are coming through the open southern border.
[03:02:46.088 --> 03:02:49.290]  It's people from any country can come through here.
[03:02:49.290 --> 03:03:03.697]  We have anchor babies from China, women who are coming here and having babies, coming here on a vacation just to have a baby from China so they can go back and then have a child who can then help them to come in with immigration, help them to get on a welfare state if they want.
[03:03:03.697 --> 03:03:11.760]  So that's the issue that we have with it, is that there has to be some kind of a process, there has to be some kind of control with it.
[03:03:11.760 --> 03:03:12.601]  Does that make sense to you?
[03:03:14.426 --> 03:03:15.067]  I agree with that.
[03:03:15.067 --> 03:03:16.468]  I understand that.
[03:03:16.468 --> 03:03:17.869]  I know you're not attacking anybody.
[03:03:17.869 --> 03:03:18.670]  I know you're not.
[03:03:18.670 --> 03:03:25.515]  But at the same time, what I'm trying to say is that generally when you use those type of terms, I mean, there has to be a way where we can all just get together and just talk.
[03:03:25.515 --> 03:03:31.060]  It's the same thing of whether or not this whole COVID thing is true, because I've tried to rationalize it myself.
[03:03:31.060 --> 03:03:32.441]  I see both sides of the picture.
[03:03:32.441 --> 03:03:33.261]  I definitely see that.
[03:03:33.261 --> 03:03:39.526]  You know, you guys have some points on just overall the things that are going on, just this freak outbreaks and all that.
[03:03:40.615 --> 03:03:47.837]  You know, there has to be something to it, and you know, all the operations going on, like Operation Dead Helm, which is definitely sketchy.
[03:03:47.837 --> 03:03:57.899]  And the only way I found out about it is because of you guys, so I get what you're trying to say, but at the same time, let's just say if this is real or not, don't you kind of... That's another thing I just wanted to address.
[03:03:57.899 --> 03:04:02.561]  I know I'm kind of jumping here and there, but that's another thing I kind of wanted to address, because let's say this is true.
[03:04:02.561 --> 03:04:07.762]  Let's say this whole New World Order thing is absolutely 100% you guys are on point.
[03:04:07.762 --> 03:04:08.202]  Don't you guys...
[03:04:09.914 --> 03:04:13.117]  Uh, isn't there any way we can just kind of sit down and talk about it?
[03:04:13.117 --> 03:04:19.584]  Because regardless, um, for example, I've listened to people like, um, Mr. Lou Rudowsky, right, from We Are Change.
[03:04:19.584 --> 03:04:21.646]  And I understand, you know, I like his work too.
[03:04:21.646 --> 03:04:24.368]  He goes out there, he asks the real questions, he gets in their face.
[03:04:24.368 --> 03:04:28.673]  At the same time, I feel like that sort of approach is sort of like, you know, it's very,
[03:04:29.195 --> 03:04:30.596]  Well, we're almost out of time.
[03:04:30.596 --> 03:04:32.376]  Sorry to the other callers.
[03:04:32.376 --> 03:04:35.117]  But yeah, I did want to address that.
[03:04:35.117 --> 03:04:44.821]  The thing is, we have to understand that even when you're talking about the open borders, that is something that is really part of, you said, if this new world order really exists, that is part of their strategy.
[03:04:44.821 --> 03:04:49.663]  That's why Nancy Pelosi said we have two communities, it just happens to have a border coming through it.
[03:04:49.663 --> 03:04:51.023]  It doesn't mean anything to them.
[03:04:51.023 --> 03:04:53.644]  You have to look at what their endgame is.
[03:04:53.644 --> 03:04:56.005]  And it doesn't work out for people on either side of the border.
[03:04:56.386 --> 03:04:57.153]  That's it for today.
[03:04:57.153 --> 03:04:59.332]  Join us for the nightly news tonight at 7 central.
