[00:00:04.929 --> 00:00:06.229]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.229 --> 00:00:08.010]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:09.770]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:11.351]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.351 --> 00:00:12.891]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.891 --> 00:00:17.092]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.092 --> 00:00:21.133]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:33.746 --> 00:00:39.289]  I tell you, this is a mouthful right here.
[00:00:39.289 --> 00:00:52.257]  Hillary protesters, Black Transgender Lives Matter, chanting Hillary for President.
[00:00:52.257 --> 00:00:53.498]  That's all our country's about.
[00:00:53.498 --> 00:00:57.541]  It's not about having privacy rights, private property rights, sovereignty.
[00:00:59.571 --> 00:01:11.202]  We live under a fiat currency system, but we can have black, transgendered protesters saying Hillary for prison.
[00:01:11.202 --> 00:01:13.183]  Well, I guess they've got that right.
[00:01:13.183 --> 00:01:24.734]  Hillary Clinton, as I said a few weeks ago, really is very close to being destroyed politically, and the mantle of her invincibility has certainly worn off in a big, big way.
[00:01:26.195 --> 00:01:33.399]  Meanwhile, Clinton's turning up her rhetoric and comparing pro-lifers to terrorists.
[00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:34.820]  But Hillary doesn't care.
[00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:39.023]  She's gone out on the campaign trail and also sent emails and made phone calls.
[00:01:39.023 --> 00:01:43.846]  It's being reported by the Associated Press and others, and also Bloomberg Politics.
[00:01:43.846 --> 00:01:47.168]  It's BigRedLinked on DrudgeReport.com today.
[00:01:47.168 --> 00:01:55.073]  ClintonCamp claims it's already secured one-fifth of the delegates needed for the nomination.
[00:01:57.031 --> 00:02:07.835]  And basically says that she's already got the votes and that they're not going to be able to stop her so they better not try to push Joe Biden.
[00:02:07.835 --> 00:02:16.819]  And of course the big goal there by Hillary is to put down the idea that there's a massive exodus away from her that's already happened.
[00:02:20.177 --> 00:02:25.022]  If Hillary Clinton can be shot down, this is a big, big, big political victory.
[00:02:25.022 --> 00:02:26.903]  Because she knows where the bodies are buried.
[00:02:26.903 --> 00:02:29.586]  She runs a lot of the blackmail operations.
[00:02:29.586 --> 00:02:33.910]  They have been in power now, off and on, for decades.
[00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:35.812]  They need to go.
[00:02:35.812 --> 00:02:42.018]  And as bad as Joe Biden is, he can probably be beaten easier
[00:02:45.225 --> 00:02:47.746]  Buy a good Republican candidate that Hillary can.
[00:02:47.746 --> 00:02:54.709]  Because Hillary, once she gets the nomination, it's just going to become total cult worship.
[00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:55.990]  Get out on your belly.
[00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:58.391]  Bow to the idol of feminism.
[00:02:58.391 --> 00:03:02.413]  It won't matter how criminal she is, what a liar she is, all the things she's done.
[00:03:02.413 --> 00:03:05.054]  It's just going to be, she's a woman.
[00:03:05.054 --> 00:03:06.395]  This gimmick.
[00:03:06.395 --> 00:03:10.057]  I'd vote for a woman in one second flat if she was like a Rand Paul.
[00:03:10.797 --> 00:03:14.063]  I'd vote for a black guy, one second flat, I could care less!
[00:03:14.063 --> 00:03:18.531]  Just give me free market, give me lower taxes, get out of my life!
[00:03:18.531 --> 00:03:21.576]  I will literally wash your feet!
[00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:30.274]  I mean, it's just ridiculous how they create identity politics to distract out of the issues.
[00:03:30.274 --> 00:03:42.744]  I mean, Republicans in the early 60s were ready to elect a Jewish guy named Barry Goldwater because he was smart, articulate, had a good voting record, and was basically like Ron Paul.
[00:03:42.744 --> 00:03:51.651]  And they actually ran campaign stuff claiming the Republicans that year were anti-Semitic.
[00:03:51.651 --> 00:03:54.393]  I went and watched a documentary last night.
[00:03:56.886 --> 00:04:04.209]  Called The Best of Enemies about Gore Vidal and William F. Buckley, and I thought it was really good, actually.
[00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:05.489]  And I have mixed feelings about Buckley.
[00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:11.651]  I think he was good at many levels, but kind of sold out on his hardcore libertarianism towards the end.
[00:04:11.651 --> 00:04:13.872]  But hindsight's 20-20.
[00:04:13.872 --> 00:04:16.833]  It's just really weird to be sitting there in the movie theater and the movie ends with me.
[00:04:18.407 --> 00:04:21.230]  The movie ends with Alex Jones.
[00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:23.352]  I just thought it was really weird.
[00:04:23.352 --> 00:04:32.920]  I mean, it's getting to the point when you become like a card in the deck of culture that you turn on television and you're on and that happened two days ago.
[00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:35.943]  I don't watch much TV and you go to the movies and you're at the end of it.
[00:04:35.943 --> 00:04:41.268]  The movie ends with a clip of me ranting at Piers Morgan.
[00:04:43.464 --> 00:04:45.125]  Just really bizarre.
[00:04:45.125 --> 00:04:46.746]  That is a very famous interview now.
[00:04:46.746 --> 00:04:50.488]  They say it's one of the most famous TV moments ever.
[00:04:50.488 --> 00:04:55.991]  I'm not bragging, I'm just saying it's interesting and it shows the effect the info war has had thanks to you.
[00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:04.707]  Since yesterday's early morning Virginia news shooting, we now know more about the shooter Vester Lee Flanagan.
[00:05:04.707 --> 00:05:10.133]  He exasperated his bosses with his stiff and nervous delivery and by his inability to use a teleprompter.
[00:05:10.133 --> 00:05:14.138]  He was also reprimanded for wearing a President Obama badge during an election report.
[00:05:14.258 --> 00:05:20.622]  In the report, his supervisor writes, this is a clear violation not only of Schertz County policy, but of standard journalistic ethics.
[00:05:20.622 --> 00:05:25.164]  Journalists, and particularly reporters who appear on television, must abide by a different standard.
[00:05:25.164 --> 00:05:28.787]  President Obama responded saying guns are worse than terrorism.
[00:05:28.787 --> 00:05:35.531]  What we know is that the number of people who die from gun-related incidents around this country dwarfs any deaths that happen through terrorism, the president added.
[00:05:35.531 --> 00:05:42.755]  Trump responded by saying, the problem is not guns, it's mental illness, which echoes the infamous appearance Alex Jones made on the Piers Morgan Show.
[00:05:42.875 --> 00:05:43.936]  How about Prozac?
[00:05:43.936 --> 00:05:46.179]  You know the number one... Oh, that's the big sponsor, isn't it?
[00:05:46.179 --> 00:05:47.880]  Don't want to talk about the U.S.
[00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:53.647]  number one cause of death is suicide now because they give people suicide mass murder pills!
[00:05:53.647 --> 00:05:56.510]  Check out the video reports on the Alex Jones Channel on YouTube.
[00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:58.292]  Rob Due reporting for InfoWars.com.
[00:05:58.692 --> 00:06:02.194]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[00:06:02.194 --> 00:06:10.439]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:06:10.439 --> 00:06:15.843]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[00:06:15.843 --> 00:06:18.384]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[00:06:18.384 --> 00:06:20.486]  We now have the synergistic solution.

[00:06:29.693 --> 00:06:31.894]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:06:31.894 --> 00:06:36.896]  You've probably noticed I've been more focused, less brain fog, more energy, and it's because of Brain Force.
[00:06:36.896 --> 00:06:40.178]  There's always hidden additives in your food, even organic food has hidden additives.
[00:06:40.178 --> 00:06:43.659]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[00:06:43.659 --> 00:06:45.360]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:46.560]  It doesn't have stimulants.
[00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:47.741]  It doesn't have garbage in it.
[00:06:47.741 --> 00:06:49.742]  It has natural things that do it clean.

[00:06:56.506 --> 00:07:08.612]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet for more than a decade.
[00:07:08.812 --> 00:07:15.897]  My favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[00:07:15.897 --> 00:07:20.800]  We have now managed to secure these sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:27.585]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[00:07:27.585 --> 00:07:34.650]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:41.756]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[00:07:41.756 --> 00:07:46.260]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:55.948]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend, you will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[00:07:55.948 --> 00:07:57.629]  Available at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:08:09.739 --> 00:08:16.881]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:08:16.881 --> 00:08:19.662]  Monday through Friday, we're here live.
[00:08:19.662 --> 00:08:24.043]  And it is Friday, the 28th day of August, 2015.
[00:08:24.043 --> 00:08:28.064]  And I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:08:28.064 --> 00:08:30.865]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:08:30.865 --> 00:08:38.427]  You notice I've been having Harry Dent, I've been having Peter Schiff, I've been having Gerald Cilente.
[00:08:39.568 --> 00:08:40.489]  And others on.
[00:08:40.489 --> 00:08:42.150]  We should get Max Keiser on.
[00:08:42.150 --> 00:08:47.954]  He's been accurate in his predictions so far on the broadcast.
[00:08:47.954 --> 00:08:52.437]  There's so much to cover, but yesterday I only mentioned it a few times.
[00:08:52.437 --> 00:08:55.119]  It really is the biggest news still.
[00:08:55.119 --> 00:08:56.740]  China is dumping U.S.
[00:08:56.740 --> 00:08:58.782]  securities.
[00:08:58.782 --> 00:09:00.083]  Not just bonds.
[00:09:01.383 --> 00:09:18.369]  But other securities connected predominantly to the United States, there's definitely a trade war on, definitely a currency war with China, with its Yuan, and Japan with its Yen, and the United States with the dollar, driving these down quickly.
[00:09:18.369 --> 00:09:27.572]  There is a massive slowdown in raw material being mined, being produced, because there isn't a market for it.
[00:09:28.459 --> 00:09:33.680]  The planet is in cardiac arrest industrially.
[00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:40.802]  Here in the United States, in areas of wealthy Europe, if you're middle class or wealthy, you're not feeling it yet.
[00:09:40.802 --> 00:09:43.482]  If you're a blue collar worker, you're feeling it.
[00:09:43.482 --> 00:09:47.163]  If you're a lower middle class person, you're feeling it.
[00:09:47.163 --> 00:09:54.944]  If you are a welfare recipient, you're feeling it, because the checks aren't growing for what real inflation is.
[00:09:54.944 --> 00:09:56.985]  So we have deflation in the economy,
[00:09:57.927 --> 00:10:00.209]  And in human activity.
[00:10:00.209 --> 00:10:08.134]  There's a slowdown, but there's also inflation in the currencies, in the price of a pound of hamburger meat.
[00:10:08.134 --> 00:10:11.016]  I mean, anybody goes to the store, you can see it.
[00:10:11.016 --> 00:10:15.159]  And I thought, is it just whole paycheck that's getting so much expensive?
[00:10:15.159 --> 00:10:17.961]  I'm gonna go to HEB and see if it's gone up in price.
[00:10:17.961 --> 00:10:19.762]  Gone up as well.
[00:10:19.762 --> 00:10:24.465]  So, HEB's a chain here in Texas if you don't live here.
[00:10:24.465 --> 00:10:25.586]  It's happening.
[00:10:25.586 --> 00:10:26.967]  Everything is going up.
[00:10:29.457 --> 00:10:36.959]  Except for commodities like fuel, and that's because the economy is basically in a freefall.
[00:10:36.959 --> 00:10:40.881]  This is a big, big deal, and it's a harbinger for things to come.
[00:10:40.881 --> 00:10:48.223]  And if you go to InfoWars.com, we have reports on the subject.
[00:10:48.223 --> 00:10:56.486]  But the place that really has the full breakdown on the stories I'm about to cover, if you want to follow along with them, is DrudgeReport.com.
[00:10:56.486 --> 00:10:57.026]  Exodus!
[00:10:58.419 --> 00:11:11.390]  Hundreds die just in the last day as desperate immigrants head for Europe, boat packed with refugees, smugglers beat migrants who beg for air.
[00:11:11.390 --> 00:11:12.871]  Desperate tide of humanity.
[00:11:12.871 --> 00:11:18.456]  And there's video of women running into barbed wire in Turkey.
[00:11:18.456 --> 00:11:20.838]  There's video of the boats capsizing.
[00:11:20.838 --> 00:11:25.582]  There's video of just hundreds and thousands pouring over fences.
[00:11:25.582 --> 00:11:26.603]  When I was in England,
[00:11:28.763 --> 00:11:33.625]  They were trying to have everybody remain calm on BBC, but you can see the concern.
[00:11:33.625 --> 00:11:38.807]  Where they've had to shut for months the main ferries and the tunnel.
[00:11:38.807 --> 00:11:49.711]  Because they cannot stop human waves of carjacking, truckjacking, North African and Middle Eastern immigrants just power surging through.
[00:11:52.301 --> 00:12:01.408]  And if you just go to YouTube and type in, truck jacking or immigrants attack drivers in Spain or France.
[00:12:01.408 --> 00:12:04.210]  I mean, there's hundreds of videos shot by the truck drivers.
[00:12:04.210 --> 00:12:09.834]  I've spent hours, in fact, we have to make a whole special on this, just showing the highlights of it.
[00:12:09.834 --> 00:12:11.415]  It's scary.
[00:12:11.415 --> 00:12:16.639]  And the mayor in the French town ordered the ferry shut a few months ago.
[00:12:16.639 --> 00:12:19.341]  And every time they try to reopen them, it just surges again.
[00:12:19.341 --> 00:12:20.943]  So England, even though they want
[00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:26.063]  The illegals that get on the backs of the trucks and come in and they legalize them?
[00:12:26.063 --> 00:12:35.411]  They don't want it to be too obvious because now they're just carjacking, throwing the people out, driving the trucks in, and basically the British government just stands there and lets them do it.
[00:12:35.411 --> 00:12:40.615]  I mean, it is the collapse of society going on.
[00:12:40.615 --> 00:12:47.080]  We can roll the footage if you're a TV viewer of just the surging and the carjacking and they're robbing each other.
[00:12:48.402 --> 00:12:52.263]  You can have a, say, a North African fishing boat that can hold 50 people maximum.
[00:12:52.263 --> 00:12:53.824]  They'll try to put 200 in it.
[00:12:53.824 --> 00:12:57.165]  And it'll sink a hundred yards off shore.
[00:12:57.165 --> 00:12:59.006]  That's how desperate these people are.
[00:12:59.006 --> 00:13:05.168]  I wouldn't get in a boat with my kids if it obviously had water coming up to the edge.
[00:13:05.168 --> 00:13:08.949]  Because the first thing that happens when you hit any high waves, you're dead.
[00:13:11.843 --> 00:13:14.265]  How are you going to deal with people that desperate?
[00:13:14.265 --> 00:13:18.910]  Let me tell you, when you look at these immigrants, I'm not demonizing them, I'm telling you the facts.
[00:13:18.910 --> 00:13:23.555]  When you look at these immigrants from collapsing Africa and the Middle East, they're skinny folks.
[00:13:23.555 --> 00:13:26.858]  They almost look like concentration camp victims.
[00:13:26.858 --> 00:13:28.440]  They're desperate.
[00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:33.725]  Every military report from the UK, the US, shows the same thing from World War II and other conflicts.
[00:13:34.997 --> 00:13:39.839]  Within seven days of no food, law and order completely breaks down.
[00:13:39.839 --> 00:13:44.701]  Within 10 days, almost anyone will kill anyone for food, especially if you have kids.
[00:13:44.701 --> 00:13:47.703]  You just won't want to do it, but you'll go kill people.
[00:13:47.703 --> 00:13:56.307]  And within 15 days, 90 plus percent, something like 97 percent, depending on the study, resort to cannibalism.
[00:13:56.307 --> 00:14:00.669]  Let's say we got 49 people working in my office right now here at the Infowars News Center.
[00:14:01.704 --> 00:14:17.169]  Customer service, writers, camera people, anchors, researchers, producers, video editors, graphics people, the shipping department, it's all here in one place.
[00:14:17.169 --> 00:14:26.093]  Statistically, something like 45 of 49 would end up eating each other.
[00:14:26.093 --> 00:14:29.674]  And that's the same in your office, and the same everywhere else.
[00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:40.385]  And I don't know what the elites are thinking, and I don't want to talk about my office, so we can all think about how barbarous humans are.
[00:14:40.385 --> 00:14:43.027]  You know, when they study humans, they study rats.
[00:14:43.027 --> 00:14:48.711]  Rat colonies, when they get up to a large enough number, start having wars.
[00:14:48.711 --> 00:14:55.775]  And then when they start starving, they start first eating the other colony of rats, and when they've eaten that colony, they then turn on each other.
[00:14:57.674 --> 00:15:00.316]  Now rats will do something humans won't do, though.
[00:15:00.316 --> 00:15:05.240]  A mother rat will be the last one living, knowing that she's got to get to a new place.
[00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:14.868]  She will eat her babies and then find a male, have sex, and then flee in a random direction, hoping to go have babies and survive.
[00:15:14.868 --> 00:15:20.873]  So rats are even tougher than we are, but not much.
[00:15:20.873 --> 00:15:22.194]  You think elephants act like that?
[00:15:22.194 --> 00:15:22.655]  No, they don't.
[00:15:24.249 --> 00:15:25.470]  Lions don't act like that.
[00:15:25.470 --> 00:15:26.190]  They won't eat each other.
[00:15:26.190 --> 00:15:27.411]  They'll starve to death.
[00:15:27.411 --> 00:15:30.693]  Humans will eat each other.
[00:15:30.693 --> 00:15:38.477]  And I'm here to tell you right now, ladies and gentlemen, the globalists did this on purpose.
[00:15:38.477 --> 00:15:48.883]  They know if they continue to allow food and continue to allow the, quote, development of the third world, that there'll be 20 billion people in 30, 40 years.
[00:15:48.883 --> 00:15:51.305]  So they have a plan to stop it at about 9 to 10 billion.
[00:15:53.621 --> 00:16:01.244]  And out of the total insane crisis that comes, they will bring in the total technological police state.
[00:16:01.244 --> 00:16:07.406]  And so they're going to allow giant waves of immigrants in with the welfare, with the incentives, with the free housing.
[00:16:07.406 --> 00:16:13.749]  Oh, they give the North African and Islamic immigrants free housing in Canada and other areas.
[00:16:13.749 --> 00:16:15.049]  I have a news article today.
[00:16:15.049 --> 00:16:17.130]  But if you're Christian, you are denied.
[00:16:17.130 --> 00:16:19.211]  That is actually in the Canadian newspapers.
[00:16:21.004 --> 00:16:22.847]  You're a Christian, you don't get a free house.
[00:16:22.847 --> 00:16:24.349]  You're an Islamist?
[00:16:24.349 --> 00:16:26.071]  You do.
[00:16:26.071 --> 00:16:27.613]  You ask, why is that?
[00:16:27.613 --> 00:16:36.445]  Because there's select groups they want to bring in for the culture war.
[00:16:36.445 --> 00:16:38.088]  I mean, this is so diabolical.
[00:16:41.229 --> 00:16:55.821]  And when they're done flooding the West with illegal invasions, they'll use those people to divide and conquer, politically conquer, in a coalition government, fractured government, broken government system that Larry Nichols talks about in the Clinton Strategy and the Clinton Chronicles.
[00:16:55.821 --> 00:17:04.689]  Divide and conquer, and then they're going to shut the borders down, totally fortress them, and then that's when the bioweapons get released on the third world.
[00:17:04.689 --> 00:17:07.211]  For those of you out there that are racist and don't like third world people,
[00:17:08.334 --> 00:17:10.655]  They're gonna kill all of them.
[00:17:10.655 --> 00:17:12.816]  They're gonna hit them with bio-weapons.
[00:17:12.816 --> 00:17:16.558]  And they've already been testing bio-weapons like HIV and other things on them.
[00:17:16.558 --> 00:17:20.080]  They've caught the UN adding all sorts of sterilants to the vaccines.
[00:17:20.080 --> 00:17:22.702]  That's been mainstream news.
[00:17:22.702 --> 00:17:26.724]  But that's all just beta-testing for the clash of civilizations.
[00:17:26.724 --> 00:17:28.585]  They're gonna clash the third world.
[00:17:30.814 --> 00:17:37.578]  Six and a half billion plus people, about to be eight billion in just a few years, and then ten billion in the third world.
[00:17:37.578 --> 00:17:47.464]  They're going to allow controlled... You can have a whole lake of water with strip mining, with big fire hoses hitting the rocks to wash out the gold.
[00:17:47.464 --> 00:17:50.866]  So they got a whole lake of six plus billion people.
[00:17:50.866 --> 00:17:53.608]  You think it's bad them firing millions in a year?
[00:17:53.608 --> 00:17:55.769]  That's a controlled stream out of the lake.
[00:17:55.769 --> 00:17:58.331]  They're gonna drain the lake and kill all those people.
[00:17:59.218 --> 00:18:01.220]  I'm giving you their master plan right now.
[00:18:01.220 --> 00:18:05.825]  But first, they're going to fire them into the West to take the West down.
[00:18:05.825 --> 00:18:07.287]  And I want to be clear.
[00:18:07.287 --> 00:18:08.788]  I care about these people.
[00:18:08.788 --> 00:18:09.829]  I have empathy.
[00:18:09.829 --> 00:18:18.699]  It makes me sick watching the footage that comes out of Africa as hundreds of people piling boats that can't carry half of them.
[00:18:18.699 --> 00:18:19.740]  And hundreds die a day.
[00:18:21.650 --> 00:18:34.061]  But what incentivized it was the West saying you get free welfare, free housing, come to Germany, come to Italy, come to Spain, come to France.
[00:18:34.061 --> 00:18:34.922]  And yes, it's true.
[00:18:34.922 --> 00:18:37.584]  The globalists went into every country that tried to stabilize.
[00:18:37.584 --> 00:18:39.986]  You can say what you want about South Africa under apartheid.
[00:18:39.986 --> 00:18:42.468]  It was building up all of Africa.
[00:18:42.468 --> 00:18:45.211]  Not defending it, not defending Gaddafi and his socialism.
[00:18:46.090 --> 00:18:57.785]  But he really lived in a tent, had a small compound with a swimming pool, and gave almost all of the country's money to the poor, women in college, real jobs, highways, aquifers, jet aircraft jobs.
[00:18:57.785 --> 00:19:00.108]  I mean, that place was nice.
[00:19:00.108 --> 00:19:00.709]  It's gone.
[00:19:00.709 --> 00:19:02.190]  They admit it's totally destroyed.
[00:19:03.018 --> 00:19:08.640]  He was giving loans and building up Africa and building roads because he was a cocky peacock.
[00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:09.600]  I don't think he was a bad guy.
[00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:16.302]  I mean, overall, compared to the globalists, he wanted to build up Africa.
[00:19:16.302 --> 00:19:19.023]  He wanted old-fashioned prosperity.
[00:19:19.023 --> 00:19:20.244]  And I don't endorse socialism.
[00:19:20.244 --> 00:19:24.005]  The only way it works is a philosopher king that has a bunch of resources.
[00:19:25.404 --> 00:19:30.425]  Like in the old days, gold or water, or in his case, oil and water.
[00:19:30.425 --> 00:19:31.645]  Big aquifer.
[00:19:31.645 --> 00:19:33.985]  And he was just giving it all away.
[00:19:33.985 --> 00:19:34.906]  He really was.
[00:19:34.906 --> 00:19:36.026]  And they weren't going to allow that.
[00:19:36.026 --> 00:19:40.807]  They went in there and killed him, turned the jihadis loose, and that place is a hellhole now.
[00:19:40.807 --> 00:19:46.868]  And so, yes, Africa is collapsing because the West has tried to keep it in a squalor to politically control it.
[00:19:46.868 --> 00:19:48.088]  It's cloward and pivot.
[00:19:48.088 --> 00:19:50.208]  They want you poor, they want you dumb.
[00:19:50.208 --> 00:19:52.049]  They're doing the same thing here.
[00:19:52.049 --> 00:19:53.829]  And they're going to bring in these populations now,
[00:19:54.989 --> 00:19:56.771]  You basically set that up in the West.
[00:19:56.771 --> 00:19:59.773]  This is the master plan.
[00:19:59.773 --> 00:20:00.974]  That's disgusting.
[00:20:00.974 --> 00:20:02.015]  What's that smell?
[00:20:02.015 --> 00:20:04.057]  Roll down your window before I pass out.
[00:20:04.057 --> 00:20:06.499]  It's those nasty fish oil pills I've been taking.
[00:20:06.499 --> 00:20:09.622]  Why won't you just switch to Nutri-Gold fish oil like I did?
[00:20:09.622 --> 00:20:10.582]  It's fish oil.
[00:20:10.582 --> 00:20:11.703]  What's the difference?
[00:20:11.703 --> 00:20:15.727]  Well, my Nutri-Gold fish oil is sourced and manufactured right here in the USA.
[00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:17.463]  What's so special about that?
[00:20:17.463 --> 00:20:18.124]  Aren't they all?
[00:20:18.124 --> 00:20:18.906]  Are you kidding?
[00:20:18.906 --> 00:20:20.049]  Of course not!
[00:20:20.049 --> 00:20:24.779]  Only Nutrigold fish oil is 100% USA made, which is why it's so fresh.
[00:20:25.439 --> 00:20:28.362]  100% product of USA and fresh?
[00:20:28.362 --> 00:20:29.743]  I like the sound of that.
[00:20:29.743 --> 00:20:31.285]  So, no more fish burps?
[00:20:31.285 --> 00:20:32.326]  No more fish burps.
[00:20:32.326 --> 00:20:33.427]  And that's not all.
[00:20:33.427 --> 00:20:40.453]  If you go to www.fishoil.fest and enter my fish oil, you can save $5 like I did.
[00:20:40.453 --> 00:20:41.394]  That won't be necessary.
[00:20:41.394 --> 00:20:42.856]  We can just share your bottle.
[00:20:42.856 --> 00:20:43.636]  Nice try.
[00:20:43.636 --> 00:20:46.699]  Get your own at www.fishoil.fest.
[00:20:48.105 --> 00:20:48.566]  Sorry.
[00:20:48.566 --> 00:20:50.147]  Get rid of those fish burps for good.
[00:20:50.147 --> 00:20:59.153]  Go to Nutrigold's US-made fish oil products by going to www.fishoil.best and get $5 off by entering my fish oil at checkout.
[00:20:59.153 --> 00:21:03.236]  Alex Jones here with a very important news alert for InfoWars listeners.
[00:21:03.236 --> 00:21:13.704]  We've confirmed through our major suppliers attempting to resupply Survival Shield X2 Deep Earth Crystals that elite corporations are buying up the supplies all over the world.
[00:21:13.704 --> 00:21:16.626]  So prices are going up and it's very hard to secure it.
[00:21:16.766 --> 00:21:25.893]  We have been able to secure a limited supply of the Pure Deep Earth Crystals and have now been able to produce more Survival Shield Nascent Iodine X2.
[00:21:25.893 --> 00:21:27.415]  This is the good halogen.
[00:21:27.415 --> 00:21:30.477]  This is the opposite of the bad halogens like fluoride.
[00:21:30.477 --> 00:21:42.487]  Now we at Infowarslife.com are bringing you the only source of clean, pure 99.99 Ultra Pure Deep Earth Crystals from more than 7,000 feet below the Earth's surface.
[00:21:42.487 --> 00:21:43.748]  Watch the informational videos

[00:21:59.716 --> 00:22:01.297]  We've all heard the news stories.
[00:22:01.297 --> 00:22:02.418]  Another shooting.
[00:22:02.418 --> 00:22:04.118]  And they're getting worse.

[00:22:31.095 --> 00:22:32.837]  Does your water contain chlorine or fluoride?

[00:23:31.332 --> 00:23:33.813]  But where do you go when there's nowhere to go?
[00:23:33.813 --> 00:23:36.034]  The answer is the Biffy Bag.

[00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:56.981]  B-I-F-F-Y B-A-G.com.
[00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:23.421]  Monday through Friday, 11 a.m.
[00:24:23.421 --> 00:24:23.961]  to 2 p.m.
[00:24:23.961 --> 00:24:24.801]  Central, we're here.
[00:24:24.801 --> 00:24:27.962]  Back Sundays, I'll be hosting this Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:24:27.962 --> 00:24:29.242]  Central Standard Time.
[00:24:29.242 --> 00:24:31.483]  David Knight did a great job last Sunday.
[00:24:32.964 --> 00:24:35.446]  They are flying back right now from Virginia.
[00:24:35.446 --> 00:24:38.529]  They ran out there to cover the press conferences and the event.
[00:24:38.529 --> 00:24:41.411]  Of course, it happened a few days ago.
[00:24:41.411 --> 00:24:52.381]  Coming up again, Peter Schiff will be joining us to take your phone calls and break down the ongoing financial unraveling and what China's doing, announcing that it's starting to dump U.S.
[00:24:52.381 --> 00:24:55.784]  Treasury notes, bonds as well.
[00:24:55.784 --> 00:25:00.388]  We've got a lot on Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton, the Pope coming.
[00:25:03.168 --> 00:25:21.631]  But really the big issue, the front and center, at least for me, and I want to get your take on this, is the fact that whether it's the United States, whether it's Canada, whether it is Europe, it's the exact same policy.
[00:25:21.631 --> 00:25:29.673]  The most unskilled, desperate immigrants are told if you can get here, you can get put on welfare, have your babies for free, get housing,
[00:25:31.035 --> 00:25:36.020]  And you can go run a little shop or something and make money on the side and get welfare.
[00:25:36.020 --> 00:25:38.663]  And I don't blame these people trying to get here.
[00:25:38.663 --> 00:25:48.593]  But it's caused such a flood that we have giant trainloads of people hanging off from Guatemala, Nicaragua, El Salvador, coming up to Texas.
[00:25:50.717 --> 00:26:09.107]  And then the Border Patrol's there to give them vouchers to put them on buses, to bus them to the Democratic Party headquarters, and to the Catholic Church, and to other churches, to then bus them deeply into Democrat-controlled areas, where Democrats house them in their homes, and get upwards of $7,000 a month for three people.
[00:26:11.101 --> 00:26:12.182]  I mean, we broke all that.
[00:26:12.182 --> 00:26:13.282]  We showed it in the news.
[00:26:13.282 --> 00:26:14.743]  We showed the ads in the paper.
[00:26:14.743 --> 00:26:16.664]  We showed them being loaded on the buses.
[00:26:16.664 --> 00:26:18.806]  We showed the Border Patrol giving them the vouchers.
[00:26:18.806 --> 00:26:20.286]  Because the Border Patrol was ordered to do it.
[00:26:20.286 --> 00:26:23.588]  They called us in to show it.
[00:26:23.588 --> 00:26:24.209]  We broke that.
[00:26:24.209 --> 00:26:25.009]  I'm not bragging.
[00:26:25.009 --> 00:26:28.611]  I'm just saying the media knows about this.
[00:26:28.611 --> 00:26:32.794]  Remember the Border Patrol went on Fox and said, yes, we complete the smuggling process.
[00:26:32.794 --> 00:26:34.115]  It's illegal.
[00:26:34.115 --> 00:26:34.915]  It's smuggling.
[00:26:34.915 --> 00:26:35.936]  It's a felony.
[00:26:35.936 --> 00:26:37.837]  If you or I got caught coyoteing,
[00:26:39.401 --> 00:26:46.385]  10 Mexicans or 10 Chinese in or 10 Eastern Europeans or 10, you know, whatever.
[00:26:46.385 --> 00:26:51.929]  If we did something like that, it is a serious felony crime.
[00:26:51.929 --> 00:26:57.312]  But when they do it because the president said so, it's supposedly all right.
[00:26:57.312 --> 00:26:59.153]  And there's wave after wave.
[00:26:59.153 --> 00:27:02.955]  They made it about migrant children to manipulate your hearts.
[00:27:02.955 --> 00:27:07.198]  That was only 17% of the immigrants coming in in the last year.
[00:27:07.198 --> 00:27:07.598]  Look it up.
[00:27:08.814 --> 00:27:10.415]  They just go, look, it's children!
[00:27:10.415 --> 00:27:14.179]  Obama says open your heart!
[00:27:14.179 --> 00:27:18.082]  It's purely a manipulation!
[00:27:18.082 --> 00:27:25.809]  There are so many people being born in the third world that the population basically doubles every 30 years.
[00:27:25.809 --> 00:27:29.272]  I mean, are we going to have 20 billion people come here?
[00:27:29.272 --> 00:27:30.493]  And pay for it?
[00:27:30.493 --> 00:27:31.795]  It's slavery!
[00:27:31.795 --> 00:27:33.116]  You can't go there and do that.
[00:27:34.468 --> 00:27:41.913]  If we would have just let the third world industrialized, stayed out of it, their population would have already started going down.
[00:27:41.913 --> 00:27:43.855]  All the different metrics show that.
[00:27:43.855 --> 00:27:52.081]  The Royal Commission on Population by His Royal Highness 1949, the mother of Queen Elizabeth, the father of Queen Elizabeth, they both commissioned
[00:27:54.167 --> 00:28:19.347]  A 300-plus page report, I've read it, admitting that if they industrialize the third world, that would cap world population at about 5 billion by the mid-1990s in their actuaries, but that that would then make the third world independent and wealthy and not part of the central control, so the decision was made to let population bloom to create even more cheap labor and squalor to control those populations.
[00:28:30.993 --> 00:28:38.858]  So we sit here, watching all of this unfold, and you can say, well, be nice.
[00:28:38.858 --> 00:28:42.040]  You're in a lifeboat, it can hold 10 people, safely.
[00:28:42.040 --> 00:28:46.743]  Maybe it can hold 15, but if you hit really big waves, you're gonna swamp and go under.
[00:28:46.743 --> 00:28:51.165]  If you put 20 in, little waves will sink you.
[00:28:51.165 --> 00:28:55.528]  The globalists are trying to put 30 people in a lifeboat that holds 10.
[00:28:55.528 --> 00:28:58.129]  They're trying to put 200 in a lifeboat that holds 100.
[00:29:00.503 --> 00:29:20.451]  We can show you the photos, show you the videos of lifeboats absolutely jam-packed with 200, 300 people where they can't even breathe, they're so sardined in.
[00:29:20.451 --> 00:29:26.773]  150 plus thousand illegals on one Greece island in the last two months, Lesbos.
[00:29:31.992 --> 00:29:48.388]  This is what's happening, and it's being incentivized, and it's getting worse, and it's going to absolutely devastate Western civilization, and it's not going to help anybody in these third world countries, and they're going to be used as leftist operatives.
[00:29:48.388 --> 00:29:52.111]  Here on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:52.111 --> 00:29:54.794]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:58.999 --> 00:30:04.845]  Since yesterday's early morning Virginia news shooting, we now know more about the shooter Vester Lee Flanagan.
[00:30:04.845 --> 00:30:10.270]  He exasperated his bosses with his stiff and nervous delivery and by his inability to use a teleprompter.
[00:30:10.270 --> 00:30:14.274]  He was also reprimanded for wearing a President Obama badge during an election report.
[00:30:14.394 --> 00:30:20.758]  In the report, his supervisor writes, this is a clear violation not only of Schertz County policy, but of standard journalistic ethics.
[00:30:20.758 --> 00:30:25.281]  Journalists, and particularly reporters who appear on television, must abide by a different standard.
[00:30:25.281 --> 00:30:28.923]  President Obama responded saying guns are worse than terrorism.
[00:30:28.923 --> 00:30:35.647]  What we know is that the number of people who die from gun-related incidents around this country dwarfs any deaths that happen through terrorism, the president added.
[00:30:35.647 --> 00:30:42.892]  Trump responded by saying, the problem is not guns, it's mental illness, which echoes the infamous appearance Alex Jones made on the Piers Morgan Show.
[00:30:43.012 --> 00:30:44.073]  How about Prozac?
[00:30:44.073 --> 00:30:46.316]  You know the number one... Oh, that's the big sponsor, isn't it?
[00:30:46.316 --> 00:30:48.018]  Don't want to talk about the U.S.
[00:30:48.018 --> 00:30:53.766]  number one cause of death is suicide now because they give people suicide mass murder pills!
[00:30:53.766 --> 00:30:56.629]  Check out the video reports on the Alex Jones Channel on YouTube.
[00:30:56.629 --> 00:30:58.432]  Rob Dew reporting for InfoWars.com

[00:32:40.081 --> 00:32:43.563]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[00:32:43.563 --> 00:32:45.543]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[00:32:45.543 --> 00:32:46.464]  It doesn't have stimulants.
[00:32:46.464 --> 00:32:47.644]  It doesn't have garbage in it.

[00:33:02.839 --> 00:33:03.440]  It's Friday.
[00:33:03.440 --> 00:33:07.864]  That wife of mine, the suspicious kind, she says that I'm quite a flirter.
[00:33:16.434 --> 00:33:21.177]  I've been a good boy all of the time and I wouldn't do nothin' to her.
[00:33:21.177 --> 00:33:22.958]  That's Junior Brown.
[00:33:22.958 --> 00:33:27.900]  She'll tan my hide for spendin' the night with Betty Lou or Alice.
[00:33:27.900 --> 00:33:29.841]  Another Texas classic.
[00:33:29.841 --> 00:33:33.163]  But I'm sleepin' alone in this wreck I own.
[00:33:33.163 --> 00:33:36.004]  Broke Down South of Dallas.
[00:33:36.004 --> 00:33:38.486]  Great guitarist.
[00:33:41.357 --> 00:33:46.699]  When I stumble home at the break of dawn, she better not be suspicious.
[00:33:46.699 --> 00:33:54.101]  Cause I'm about at the end of my rope, and she better not act too vicious.
[00:33:54.101 --> 00:34:00.943]  I'm covered with grease from my head to my feet, my hands are cut and calloused.
[00:34:00.943 --> 00:34:05.765]  I spent all my bucks on a broke-down truck, a broke-down Salvador.
[00:34:10.364 --> 00:34:11.844]  You want answers?
[00:34:11.844 --> 00:34:13.465]  Well, so does he.
[00:34:13.465 --> 00:34:19.229]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:34:19.229 --> 00:34:37.279]  Before I forget, coming in to the office this morning, well actually hiking with my cousin Buckley, I do that a few days a week, over some of the hills and little mountains around town, outside town, it just hit me that I need to put a message out to Rand Paul.
[00:34:38.365 --> 00:34:42.309]  And that I could just see his strategy in my mind.
[00:34:42.309 --> 00:34:44.090]  I could see his advisors.
[00:34:44.090 --> 00:34:45.371]  Some of which I know.
[00:34:51.689 --> 00:34:54.491]  And when she talks, I listen.
[00:34:54.491 --> 00:34:56.913]  I love that part.
[00:34:56.913 --> 00:35:00.716]  I got a wife with a frying pan.
[00:35:00.716 --> 00:35:03.458]  But I'm broke down.
[00:35:03.458 --> 00:35:09.242]  Oh, we gotta shut it down.
[00:35:09.242 --> 00:35:09.702]  Please.
[00:35:09.702 --> 00:35:10.743]  It's just too good of a song.
[00:35:10.743 --> 00:35:11.644]  All of his songs.
[00:35:11.644 --> 00:35:13.565]  I don't think Junior Brown has one bad song.
[00:35:13.565 --> 00:35:16.307]  I listened to him back in high school and college.
[00:35:17.168 --> 00:35:21.970]  The great thing about Spotify is, about a few months ago, I said, you know, Junior Brown, I haven't listened to him in forever.
[00:35:21.970 --> 00:35:28.573]  And his steel guitar, pulled it up, and there's like all these new albums in the last 20 years that I haven't been listening to him.
[00:35:28.573 --> 00:35:33.095]  All these new great albums, and I've just been listening to him for about two months straight.
[00:35:33.095 --> 00:35:35.476]  So I thought, I think it's time to actually play some of that on air.
[00:35:35.476 --> 00:35:38.397]  I wonder what his politics are.
[00:35:41.345 --> 00:35:46.549]  I don't know though, the older you get, all I know is when I was 18 that sounded good, but I didn't get a lot of it.
[00:35:46.549 --> 00:35:49.011]  But when you're 41, you get a lot more of it.
[00:35:49.011 --> 00:35:54.616]  And I guess as you get older, you get to where you get all of it, huh?
[00:35:54.616 --> 00:35:56.517]  I got a wife with a frying pan.
[00:35:56.517 --> 00:36:00.801]  When she talks, I listen.
[00:36:00.801 --> 00:36:01.961]  It's country comedy, folks.
[00:36:03.126 --> 00:36:04.687]  Or maybe it's a rolling pin.
[00:36:04.687 --> 00:36:08.608]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:36:08.608 --> 00:36:09.569]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:36:09.569 --> 00:36:10.649]  I like to have a good time.
[00:36:10.649 --> 00:36:11.890]  I like to be happy.
[00:36:11.890 --> 00:36:18.113]  I'm a happy guy when I'm not on air, but when I get on air, it's serious time.
[00:36:18.113 --> 00:36:28.897]  And I want to illustrate what's happening with the collapsing borders and where the endgame of this goes, then Hillary, then Trump, then the economy, your phone calls.
[00:36:28.897 --> 00:36:30.158]  But before I forget to go there,
[00:36:31.704 --> 00:36:39.849]  I could just see the Rand Paul strategy as I was hiking up this hill.
[00:36:39.849 --> 00:36:46.112]  And I haven't really criticized Rand Paul, and I've tried to be friendly about it, but I want him to win.
[00:36:46.112 --> 00:36:52.315]  And I know that, you know, Ron Paul's a great patriot, and I'd love it if he was president.
[00:36:52.315 --> 00:36:54.076]  And Rand Paul is the clear best person.
[00:36:54.076 --> 00:36:57.718]  He was the frontrunner until a few months ago with Donald Trump.
[00:36:57.718 --> 00:36:59.800]  I can't find a fault with what Donald Trump says.
[00:36:59.800 --> 00:37:00.420]  I really like it.
[00:37:01.874 --> 00:37:07.737]  I want to believe in him, but he's got a checkered past, and so you've got to really have some reservations.
[00:37:07.737 --> 00:37:12.579]  But he's a lot better than Hillary Clinton, obviously, on the surface, or Jeb Bush.
[00:37:12.579 --> 00:37:19.343]  But I realized, I was like, you know, I ought to shoot a video, Alex Jones' message to Rand Paul, and I could call him up at home.
[00:37:19.343 --> 00:37:27.847]  I've got his home number in Kentucky, but I've got to do that when he's back at home, and I don't know his number in D.C., to get around his gatekeepers.
[00:37:27.847 --> 00:37:29.348]  But I'm not going to do that.
[00:37:29.348 --> 00:37:31.469]  Last time he was on, you know, he called up and wanted to come on.
[00:37:33.177 --> 00:37:37.718]  I guess just to show his staffers he could do what he wanted.
[00:37:37.718 --> 00:37:39.979]  But it's not like there's some falling out here.
[00:37:39.979 --> 00:37:43.640]  I really don't care at the end of the day about my relationship with Rand Paul.
[00:37:43.640 --> 00:37:47.101]  Doesn't affect the show one way or the other.
[00:37:47.101 --> 00:37:48.502]  It's just I want him to win.
[00:37:48.502 --> 00:37:52.903]  And I know he's a better candidate than somebody like Donald Trump.
[00:37:54.793 --> 00:37:59.517]  They're waiting for Donald Trump to fall on his face and burn out and go away.
[00:37:59.517 --> 00:38:01.498]  And I don't think Donald Trump's going to do that.
[00:38:01.498 --> 00:38:09.344]  Or if he does, it's going to be in the 11th hour and the 58th minute.
[00:38:09.344 --> 00:38:10.645]  It's going to be two minutes to midnight.
[00:38:10.645 --> 00:38:12.027]  It's not going to be now.
[00:38:12.027 --> 00:38:19.853]  If he is a foil, a shill, a fall guy, a ringer, I guess is the word I'm looking for.
[00:38:21.550 --> 00:38:27.655]  Then he's gonna do it at the best time for Jeb Bush or Hillary or whoever he's working for, if that's the case.
[00:38:27.655 --> 00:38:28.535]  And I'm not saying that.
[00:38:28.535 --> 00:38:32.998]  Because the older I get, I don't like to say things about people unless I'm totally sure.
[00:38:32.998 --> 00:38:34.139]  And I'm not sure.
[00:38:34.139 --> 00:38:35.220]  I'm liking Trump more every day.
[00:38:35.220 --> 00:38:37.021]  I mean, he's so sincere-sounding.
[00:38:37.021 --> 00:38:40.324]  He's so smart.
[00:38:40.324 --> 00:38:43.066]  America needs a good unifier like him.
[00:38:43.066 --> 00:38:44.467]  A smart businessman.
[00:38:44.467 --> 00:38:46.789]  A quick-on-his-feet Yankee.
[00:38:48.524 --> 00:38:51.066]  It'd be great to have a quick on his feet, smart southerner, whatever.
[00:38:51.066 --> 00:38:51.586]  I don't care.
[00:38:51.586 --> 00:38:53.107]  It's just good to have Americana.
[00:38:53.107 --> 00:38:56.490]  Donald Trump's the American dream.
[00:38:56.490 --> 00:38:59.572]  But that said, I know Rand Paul's for real.
[00:38:59.572 --> 00:39:04.136]  I've known him 20 years.
[00:39:04.136 --> 00:39:08.960]  And I didn't know if I was going to talk about it today, but then I get this Washington Post article.
[00:39:09.929 --> 00:39:16.770]  That's there to make Paul sit around while he falls in the polls, think he's got some smart strategy.
[00:39:16.770 --> 00:39:19.871]  And this is how Washington controls politicians.
[00:39:19.871 --> 00:39:21.871]  It's how it controls statesmen.
[00:39:21.871 --> 00:39:26.652]  It's how they get the media to drink the Kool-Aid and make people think they're really going to win.
[00:39:26.652 --> 00:39:35.434]  And they're seen as a serious candidate, even though they're not doing well in the polls now, because the intelligentsia is buying into them and they're totally roping a dope.
[00:39:37.375 --> 00:39:42.599]  So, what I envisioned brainstorming is when you're pumping blood through your brain, when you think the best.
[00:39:42.599 --> 00:39:50.645]  I saw exactly what was happening to Paul, and then I opened up the Washington Post, and here it is.
[00:39:50.645 --> 00:39:52.086]  And I couldn't even read the whole thing.
[00:39:52.086 --> 00:39:58.631]  It is a long article by David Weigel.
[00:39:58.631 --> 00:40:03.315]  And all I'd say is, Rand, don't let the Weigels eat your brain.
[00:40:03.315 --> 00:40:05.056]  Don't let the worms into your brain.
[00:40:05.056 --> 00:40:05.837]  Rand Paul
[00:40:07.079 --> 00:40:12.041]  Was 2,487 miles away from Beltway journalists who had written off his campaign.
[00:40:12.041 --> 00:40:14.222]  And he was loving it!
[00:40:14.222 --> 00:40:18.923]  And then it just goes into the strategy he's got.
[00:40:18.923 --> 00:40:28.247]  And I could just see his advisors telling him this exact stuff.
[00:40:28.247 --> 00:40:35.370]  And him buying into it and waiting for Trump to go away and telling him to attack Trump.
[00:40:35.370 --> 00:40:36.450]  No, that's not a good move.
[00:40:38.942 --> 00:40:41.262]  You need to out-Trump Trump and get aggressive.
[00:40:41.262 --> 00:40:44.363]  The same thing I told your dad.
[00:40:44.363 --> 00:40:46.924]  That's all Ron Paul needed was to get a little more aggressive.
[00:40:46.924 --> 00:40:49.084]  I get he's a doctor, a statesman, a classy guy.
[00:40:49.084 --> 00:40:51.905]  I don't vote for him.
[00:40:51.905 --> 00:40:55.045]  I don't need all the slick flim flam.
[00:40:55.045 --> 00:41:00.927]  But the whole world's a stage, each of us players upon it.
[00:41:00.927 --> 00:41:02.427]  And they're in there telling him, don't worry.
[00:41:04.468 --> 00:41:06.690]  Trump's gonna blow himself up.
[00:41:06.690 --> 00:41:07.430]  No he's not.
[00:41:07.430 --> 00:41:09.411]  Not until it's too late.
[00:41:09.411 --> 00:41:12.734]  You were the frontrunner for a year.
[00:41:12.734 --> 00:41:20.199]  Because you were smart and declared yourself first and got out there with popular pro-liberty ideas.
[00:41:20.199 --> 00:41:25.062]  Then you tried to get too close to the left to triangulate to beat Hillary down the road.
[00:41:25.062 --> 00:41:26.583]  That's not the fight you're having right now.
[00:41:28.413 --> 00:41:32.476]  You need to be the libertarian firebrand you are, for real.
[00:41:32.476 --> 00:41:37.980]  You and your father, I know you, are what Donald Trump says he is.
[00:41:37.980 --> 00:41:42.323]  Donald Trump looks like a real steak, looks like a real ribeye, medium rare, juicy.
[00:41:42.323 --> 00:41:43.524]  It might be wax.
[00:41:43.524 --> 00:41:45.965]  It might be plastic.
[00:41:45.965 --> 00:41:48.187]  I've bitten in to the paws.
[00:41:48.187 --> 00:41:51.249]  I know they're for real.
[00:41:51.249 --> 00:41:55.152]  So, you need to act like the red meat you are, right now.
[00:41:56.328 --> 00:42:07.335]  And the people advising you are just looking to be politicos and have a job down the road in that festering rotten possum that is Washington, D.C.
[00:42:07.335 --> 00:42:10.417]  There's two different schools here.
[00:42:10.417 --> 00:42:19.983]  There's people that say William F. Buckley lost the debates with Gore Vidal because he told him, I'll sock you in your face, you G.D.
[00:42:22.202 --> 00:42:27.826]  Queer, if you keep saying that I'm a crypto-Nazi.
[00:42:27.826 --> 00:42:35.091]  But the truth is, at the end of the day, historians believe that he won the debate because he was for real.
[00:42:35.091 --> 00:42:36.953]  And I'm not here bashing gay people or anything.
[00:42:36.953 --> 00:42:50.102]  I'm quoting historical context of him accusing a World War II combat vet who lost friends to the Nazis of being a Nazi, and William F. Buckley got mad and said, I will kick your butt right now, and clearly got mad and almost punched him.
[00:42:53.916 --> 00:42:55.718]  So who really won that debate?
[00:42:55.718 --> 00:43:00.442]  The pundits can say who won, but we all know who really won.
[00:43:00.442 --> 00:43:03.364]  And the numbers show that today.
[00:43:03.364 --> 00:43:05.046]  Same thing with Piers Morgan.
[00:43:05.046 --> 00:43:07.828]  They all declared that I was annihilated on Piers Morgan and discredited.
[00:43:07.828 --> 00:43:09.650]  It's one of the most famous clips on TV.
[00:43:09.650 --> 00:43:14.574]  Piers Morgan's ratings started skydiving after that.
[00:43:14.574 --> 00:43:15.215]  With no parachute.
[00:43:18.223 --> 00:43:23.228]  His ratings were the highest they ever were when I was on, and for two days they were high, but that was him exploding.
[00:43:23.228 --> 00:43:25.830]  That's, you know, that's a vampire at high noon burning up.
[00:43:25.830 --> 00:43:32.917]  It looks pretty spectacular when fire's shooting out of their eyeballs, when they're falling, but that was it.
[00:43:34.269 --> 00:43:37.330]  I went in there to break the trance, to say I'm not putting up with this.
[00:43:37.330 --> 00:43:41.110]  That's what Donald Trump's doing, is getting outside the box.
[00:43:41.110 --> 00:43:47.772]  Everything is about keeping us in the box, saying be mild-mannered, be nice, that's how you win, that's how you get attention.
[00:43:47.772 --> 00:43:51.172]  But that's not how you win, that's not how you get attention.
[00:43:51.172 --> 00:43:57.634]  They want you to act like that, thinking the fake candidates Hillary and Jeb you're running against are acting like that too.
[00:43:57.634 --> 00:43:58.794]  That's why they're the frontrunners.
[00:43:58.794 --> 00:44:02.135]  They're the frontrunners because of the money and the media saying they are.
[00:44:02.135 --> 00:44:03.495]  Or they were, until Trump came along.
[00:44:07.017 --> 00:44:17.534]  So it's all about this con game and I likened it to telling my cousin hiking Buckley, no relation to William F. Buckley but named after him, hiking up this hill
[00:44:19.198 --> 00:44:28.082]  I said it's like Chinese royalty was controlled by saying you've got to live in a forbidden city, you can't feed yourself, you've got to bind your feet, you've got to have foot-long fingernails, that's the style.
[00:44:28.082 --> 00:44:31.884]  You've got to speak in an affected, wimpy accent.
[00:44:31.884 --> 00:44:37.087]  That's what people behind the throne do in every dynasty by the 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th dynasty.
[00:44:37.087 --> 00:44:48.032]  I don't care if it's Russian royalty, German royalty, Japanese royalty, French royalty, Chinese royalty, Aztec royalty, they end up being these imprisoned, cloistered
[00:44:49.502 --> 00:44:58.165]  Creatures up in their tower for their protection.
[00:44:58.165 --> 00:44:59.606]  That's what the nanny state is too.
[00:44:59.606 --> 00:45:03.407]  We're all being put into a prison for our own safety.
[00:45:03.407 --> 00:45:07.368]  And Rand Paul's been put in his little political prison with his bound feet.
[00:45:07.368 --> 00:45:08.229]  Isn't he pretty?
[00:45:08.229 --> 00:45:10.850]  And his little Chinese bow and his long fingernails.
[00:45:12.472 --> 00:45:22.078]  He walks around like this, and they sit there and they feed him, his little attendants, like a bunch of bugs carrying the brain bug in.
[00:45:22.078 --> 00:45:26.841]  We take you now live to Klandathu's Star Trek Starship Troopers.
[00:45:26.841 --> 00:45:29.282]  I mean, it's just unbelievable.
[00:45:29.282 --> 00:45:31.264]  Star Trek Troopers.
[00:45:31.264 --> 00:45:32.665]  That's teleprompter free, baby.
[00:45:32.665 --> 00:45:33.905]  There's no teleprompter in here.
[00:45:33.905 --> 00:45:37.848]  So, it's just frustrating.
[00:45:39.116 --> 00:45:47.303]  I mean, Rand Paul will go to the head of the pack when he starts telling people to shut up, to get in his face, when he starts talking about the traitors in government.
[00:45:47.303 --> 00:45:54.128]  People don't want a feat of gentlemanliness anymore.
[00:45:54.128 --> 00:45:57.331]  They want leaders that are going to take action.
[00:45:57.331 --> 00:46:05.758]  And that doesn't mean you can't do it in a gentlemanly way, but Rand Paul, you're going to lose if you don't get aggressive.
[00:46:05.758 --> 00:46:07.680]  Do it, and do it now!
[00:46:10.083 --> 00:46:13.486]  I mean, Rand Paul thanked me on air, I remember, after he won the election.
[00:46:13.486 --> 00:46:18.990]  And he told me proudly on the phone, he goes, no, I gotta hand it to you, you, my dad, and a few others saying you'd support me.
[00:46:18.990 --> 00:46:20.792]  Help me go ahead and decide to run.
[00:46:20.792 --> 00:46:22.313]  I really didn't think I'd win.
[00:46:22.313 --> 00:46:25.795]  I thought we'd educate people about policies like my dad's done.
[00:46:25.795 --> 00:46:28.097]  I remember telling him, I go, you will win.
[00:46:28.097 --> 00:46:29.999]  We can help you raise millions.
[00:46:29.999 --> 00:46:32.641]  It's gonna happen.
[00:46:32.641 --> 00:46:33.662]  Just be hardcore.
[00:46:35.319 --> 00:46:37.361]  The establishment's gonna attack you.
[00:46:37.361 --> 00:46:39.402]  That's what'll make people vote for you.
[00:46:39.402 --> 00:46:42.325]  When they come after you, don't let it intimidate you.
[00:46:42.325 --> 00:46:51.652]  I gave him real hardcore political advice from the street, from the gutter, from the gut, from the real world, where I come from.
[00:46:51.652 --> 00:46:54.054]  There were no advisors telling me how to set all this up.
[00:46:54.054 --> 00:46:54.935]  There was nobody there.
[00:46:54.935 --> 00:47:01.320]  No staffers to run around following me.
[00:47:01.320 --> 00:47:02.581]  And I know what I'm talking about.
[00:47:03.835 --> 00:47:04.336]  Look at it!
[00:47:04.336 --> 00:47:08.600]  I've been telling Rand Paul for a year to act aggressive.
[00:47:08.600 --> 00:47:11.903]  And now Trump has shown you that I'm right.
[00:47:11.903 --> 00:47:14.065]  It's sitting right there in front of you.
[00:47:14.065 --> 00:47:19.070]  And don't be above adopting strategies.
[00:47:19.070 --> 00:47:25.136]  And I know full well Rand Paul is a guy's guy and drinks beer and whatever.
[00:47:25.136 --> 00:47:26.958]  But he's got the doctor's affect.
[00:47:28.476 --> 00:47:28.936]  That's all I'm saying.
[00:47:28.936 --> 00:47:29.957]  I'm done ranting about Rand Paul.
[00:47:47.461 --> 00:47:49.081]  That's my message to him.
[00:47:49.081 --> 00:48:00.344]  But, the coup de grace, the cherry on top, what pushed me over the edge to say all that, was coming in here and reading the Washington Post, praising you, what a smarty pants you are.
[00:48:00.344 --> 00:48:06.266]  The Washington Post is your friend, right?
[00:48:06.266 --> 00:48:07.906]  They were attacking you when you were the leader!
[00:48:11.283 --> 00:48:16.968]  Now they're going, that's right, you tie the bowling balls to your legs and you jump in the North Atlantic, that's how you swim.
[00:48:16.968 --> 00:48:32.001]  Never mind this life jacket, yes, put the bowling balls on, now padlock them, throw the key away, yeah, just that plank right over there, just go over that, just get on it, and then jump off right in there, and then that's how you're gonna win.
[00:48:33.871 --> 00:48:34.991]  Oh, you need help carrying the ball of balls?
[00:48:34.991 --> 00:48:36.032]  Here, let us help you.
[00:48:36.032 --> 00:48:37.012]  We're your friends, see?
[00:48:37.012 --> 00:48:41.134]  It's like in Goodfellas, where he's telling her he wants to kill her, and he goes, just go in there!
[00:48:41.134 --> 00:48:42.354]  Got some free fur coats.
[00:48:42.354 --> 00:48:45.276]  Yeah, yeah, just right, right in the door, right there.
[00:48:45.276 --> 00:48:57.621]  I'm sorry, they have like the sword all sharpened and aimed at his heart.
[00:48:57.621 --> 00:49:03.103]  Sir, if you just fall forward, right on this, it'll fix all your problems, and you'll be President of the United States.
[00:49:05.157 --> 00:49:07.938]  All those people up there in D.C.
[00:49:07.938 --> 00:49:16.682]  are there to try to keep their job and get hired by the next politician.
[00:49:16.682 --> 00:49:17.622]  We're gonna go to break.
[00:49:17.622 --> 00:49:19.043]  We're gonna come back.
[00:49:19.043 --> 00:49:24.805]  Swedish MP says make people's garages into immigrant housing and make them keep them.
[00:49:24.805 --> 00:49:28.227]  Germany's small towns fill the cost of Europe's migrant crisis.
[00:49:28.227 --> 00:49:29.907]  And if you don't like it, you're racist.
[00:49:29.907 --> 00:49:30.928]  You're going to pay.
[00:49:32.961 --> 00:49:34.402]  And that's in the New York Times.
[00:49:34.402 --> 00:49:37.303]  So we're going to be going over all of that after the break.
[00:49:37.303 --> 00:49:45.887]  Briefly, I may not have time to plug this now, but Silver Bullet is just an amazing system that a lot of folks use as an alternative.
[00:49:45.887 --> 00:49:47.728]  Or when antibiotics don't work, they use it.
[00:49:47.728 --> 00:49:50.770]  I know that's what I've done personally with a chest cold that I couldn't get rid of.
[00:49:50.770 --> 00:49:52.851]  My dad couldn't get rid of a year and a half ago.
[00:49:52.851 --> 00:49:53.451]  Killed my uncle.
[00:49:54.941 --> 00:49:55.581]  It was really bad.
[00:49:55.581 --> 00:49:57.002]  The hospitals were full of people.
[00:49:57.002 --> 00:49:59.824]  You knew it was a real pandemic because the media wouldn't cover it.
[00:49:59.824 --> 00:50:01.344]  And I just drank two bottles of it.
[00:50:01.344 --> 00:50:02.285]  I'm not saying you should do that.
[00:50:02.285 --> 00:50:03.626]  That's probably toxic.
[00:50:03.626 --> 00:50:04.426]  Consult your physician.
[00:50:04.426 --> 00:50:06.407]  But if you're in an emergency situation, whatever.
[00:50:06.407 --> 00:50:07.528]  Small dosages of it.
[00:50:07.528 --> 00:50:08.908]  Topically, whatever.
[00:50:08.908 --> 00:50:10.890]  It's amazing.
[00:50:10.890 --> 00:50:14.131]  Agents have known forever that silver is really good.
[00:50:14.131 --> 00:50:16.012]  Infowars.
[00:50:16.012 --> 00:50:16.893]  Life.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:50:16.893 --> 00:50:17.533]  The special ends today.
[00:50:22.010 --> 00:50:26.073]  30% off ends today at midnight.
[00:50:26.073 --> 00:50:33.437]  30% off, colloidal silver, one bottle or get two bottles and get the other two for free.
[00:50:33.437 --> 00:50:35.479]  That's 50% off.

[00:50:41.242 --> 00:50:47.046]  And you're supporting a hardcore organization, teleprompter free, dedicated to letting it all hang out, just attacking the enemy.
[00:50:47.546 --> 00:50:52.596]  We're in this position because we lay it down to these folks that tell us they control reality, that they're our bosses.
[00:50:52.596 --> 00:50:53.418]  No, you're not.
[00:50:53.418 --> 00:50:57.566]  You're a bunch of control freak cult members, and I'm not listening to anything you have to say, scum.
[00:50:59.039 --> 00:51:02.401]  You're old enough to tell that something is definitely wrong.
[00:51:02.401 --> 00:51:05.404]  You've been paying attention for years and you're ready.
[00:51:05.404 --> 00:51:09.767]  You're probably frustrated because your children don't listen to your words of warning.
[00:51:09.767 --> 00:51:12.869]  What will you do when your grandkids show up hungry at your door?
[00:51:12.869 --> 00:51:15.611]  Get more food storage from Ready Supply Foods.

[00:51:32.293 --> 00:51:33.994]  And they're getting worse.
[00:51:33.994 --> 00:51:37.577]  That's why Infidel Body Armor introduces Infidel Fridays.

[00:51:58.263 --> 00:52:02.504]  As if chlorine in our water weren't bad enough, now they're adding ammonia?
[00:52:02.504 --> 00:52:03.124]  It's true.
[00:52:03.124 --> 00:52:07.286]  Some municipalities are now adding ammonia plus chlorine to your water supply.
[00:52:07.286 --> 00:52:09.666]  It's a disinfectant called chloramine.
[00:52:09.666 --> 00:52:14.468]  But with a trusted Big Berkey water filter, you can keep chloramine out of your water.

[00:52:57.873 --> 00:53:03.957]  So I say to Mark at lunch, look, you know, I keep hearing from the government that, you know, they're worried someday ISIS may get here.
[00:53:03.957 --> 00:53:09.820]  Then I go, duh, Garland, Texas, Mohammed cartoon shooting, ISIS is already here.
[00:53:09.820 --> 00:53:11.961]  I'm not waiting for these people to defend me.
[00:53:11.961 --> 00:53:16.364]  If they don't know ISIS is here already, they got no clue, I'm taking care of myself.

[00:54:14.938 --> 00:54:20.442]  Yeah, what Rand Paul needs to do with Donald Trump and Hillary has come straight on for him.
[00:54:20.442 --> 00:54:23.405]  He needs to call for Hillary's indictment.
[00:54:23.405 --> 00:54:28.809]  He needs to come out and out-Trump Trump and be more hardcore and basically make the same statements.
[00:54:28.809 --> 00:54:32.472]  Because that's what he really stands for.
[00:54:32.472 --> 00:54:33.893]  We know he's the bonafide.
[00:54:33.893 --> 00:54:40.718]  We know, Senator, you're a for-real constitutionalist, paleo-conservative libertarian.
[00:54:40.718 --> 00:54:44.161]  But you've got to get down in the arena with
[00:54:45.188 --> 00:54:53.733]  Trump and not attack him, because just like I told Politico, I said you should have attacked Rand Paul by endorsing him.
[00:54:53.733 --> 00:54:57.035]  But you're too arrogant to do that.
[00:54:57.035 --> 00:55:00.737]  See, if you attack Trump, that only makes him more popular.
[00:55:00.737 --> 00:55:12.104]  You don't attack him, you obscure him by being more populist, more red meat, more hardcore.
[00:55:12.104 --> 00:55:12.744]  You come out
[00:55:15.103 --> 00:55:18.026]  And you steal his thunder.
[00:55:18.026 --> 00:55:19.948]  Now I'm done talking about it.
[00:55:19.948 --> 00:55:21.590]  We'll put this video up on YouTube tonight.
[00:55:21.590 --> 00:55:22.912]  We'll put it on InfoWars.
[00:55:22.912 --> 00:55:25.454]  I'm going to send it to Rand Paul's office.
[00:55:25.454 --> 00:55:27.797]  And Lord knows his gatekeepers will try to keep him from seeing it.
[00:55:27.797 --> 00:55:30.059]  I don't have anything against the people in his office.
[00:55:30.059 --> 00:55:30.720]  Some of them are good.
[00:55:30.720 --> 00:55:31.401]  I know some of them.
[00:55:32.901 --> 00:55:43.369]  A lot of them, you know, work for Tucker Carlson, and I'm not saying he's a bad guy, he overall is a good libertarian guy, but he's tried to work with the system, and he understands the whole system's coming down, folks.
[00:55:43.369 --> 00:55:45.771]  This is the time for hardcore rhetoric.
[00:55:45.771 --> 00:55:48.413]  This is the time people are ready for the truth.
[00:55:48.413 --> 00:55:56.179]  You're not going to counter the authoritarian left that wants to ban the term mother and father, and that is shipping illegals in illegally.
[00:55:57.386 --> 00:56:00.468]  By talking about how much you love the immigrants so you get their vote.
[00:56:00.468 --> 00:56:05.652]  They're not going to vote for you, Rand, because you're a libertarian and don't want to give them big welfare checks.
[00:56:05.652 --> 00:56:13.016]  They're going to vote for the Democratic Party, because that's whose houses they live at when they first get here for six months.
[00:56:13.016 --> 00:56:19.541]  The Democrats get them ID cards, get them on welfare, peel off part of the money, and put it back into the machine.
[00:56:19.541 --> 00:56:20.642]  It's a mafia.
[00:56:20.642 --> 00:56:22.903]  It's ACORN.
[00:56:22.903 --> 00:56:26.946]  It's Battleground Texas caught on video openly admitting all this.
[00:56:28.407 --> 00:56:34.070]  The illegals live with the Democrats and are made their slaves.
[00:56:34.070 --> 00:56:42.515]  The Democrats are basically farming them, milking them, using them as cutouts to get tax refund checks.
[00:56:42.515 --> 00:56:44.456]  You can't counter that!
[00:56:44.456 --> 00:56:51.360]  You have to defeat it, or the whole country goes down.
[00:56:51.360 --> 00:56:52.141]  And speaking of that,
[00:56:53.570 --> 00:57:05.173]  Hundreds of migrants a day, illegal aliens, coming into Europe are now dying when their boats capsize because they're so desperate that they'll put 200 people in a boat that should have 50 or 100 in it.
[00:57:05.173 --> 00:57:09.335]  And Europe's giving them free housing, free welfare, you name it, in almost every case.
[00:57:09.335 --> 00:57:12.056]  That's what's drawing them there.
[00:57:12.056 --> 00:57:15.957]  And our media just keeps saying there's no worldwide collapse even as this happens.
[00:57:15.957 --> 00:57:16.537]  And here it is.
[00:57:18.075 --> 00:57:28.523]  Out of mainstream news, television, in Sweden, Swedish MP make people's garages into immigrant housing.
[00:57:28.523 --> 00:57:37.569]  MP Fredrik Schulte said in Parliament last Friday, make people house them.
[00:57:37.569 --> 00:57:40.391]  Here is the New York Times.
[00:57:40.391 --> 00:57:43.954]  Germany's small towns feel the cost of Europe's migrant crisis.
[00:57:45.606 --> 00:57:51.650]  But you try to act like Donald Trump is a kook for not wanting every felon on the planet trying to come here.
[00:57:51.650 --> 00:57:58.976]  Germany, even as European officials struggle with an unrelenting tide of migrants, not illegals, they're migrants, they're just migrating.
[00:57:58.976 --> 00:58:13.546]  They're gonna migrate right to your house, trying, they're gonna get your paycheck, to enter the continent, tranquil villages like this one, there's a photo, a picture, book, valley in northern Bavaria, are coping with the legions who have already arrived, and you get to pay for it!
[00:58:16.611 --> 00:58:23.838]  It's a tiny town of a thousand people, and now there are thousands of illegals, and he gives examples in the towns.
[00:58:23.838 --> 00:58:35.209]  Imagine, you're a town of a thousand people, you have your own culture, you're a tourist destination, your family's been there for 20 generations, all of a sudden there's 2,000 brand new people that just came off boats,
[00:58:36.684 --> 00:58:39.805]  Just standing there, and you're gonna pay for it!
[00:58:39.805 --> 00:58:41.386]  You're gonna pay for it!
[00:58:41.386 --> 00:58:42.786]  Go back to Europe!
[00:58:42.786 --> 00:58:43.807]  Go back, pilgrim!
[00:58:43.807 --> 00:58:45.687]  Oh wait, you are from Europe!
[00:58:45.687 --> 00:58:46.668]  Sorry!
[00:58:46.668 --> 00:58:48.388]  Bye-bye!
[00:58:48.388 --> 00:58:49.369]  By the way, your number looks pretty good.
[00:58:49.369 --> 00:58:53.370]  Most of the InfoWars radio listening audience is aware of the high quality

[00:59:51.222 --> 00:59:53.859]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:04.741 --> 01:00:06.062]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.062 --> 01:00:07.822]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:07.822 --> 01:00:09.583]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:09.583 --> 01:00:11.163]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.163 --> 01:00:12.724]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:12.724 --> 01:00:16.966]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:16.966 --> 01:00:24.929]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:24.929 --> 01:00:33.832]  You can look this up, but about ten years ago, Spain, beautiful country, lot of resources, smart people,
[01:00:35.305 --> 01:00:38.387]  Amazing culture.
[01:00:38.387 --> 01:00:50.497]  Spain adopted carbon taxes and shut down more than half its coal power plants and put in windmills.
[01:00:50.497 --> 01:00:54.040]  I guess so Don Quixote could try to chop them down.
[01:00:54.040 --> 01:00:59.665]  There was a boondoggle of select interest and now Spain has 45% unemployment and people under 30.
[01:01:01.425 --> 01:01:06.089]  Spain is, except in a few areas, like Barcelona, collapsing.
[01:01:06.089 --> 01:01:07.630]  And that's admitted.
[01:01:07.630 --> 01:01:12.434]  And they're outlawing free speech, they're outlawing any criticism of government.
[01:01:12.434 --> 01:01:13.415]  You name it.
[01:01:13.415 --> 01:01:14.736]  They're arresting people.
[01:01:14.736 --> 01:01:18.919]  Even mainstream news says it's now Orwellian.
[01:01:18.919 --> 01:01:20.401]  But it's leftist.
[01:01:20.401 --> 01:01:24.444]  But notice it's fascist.
[01:01:24.444 --> 01:01:28.107]  And I was in Spain, and we have footage of this, we haven't put it out yet, we're making a documentary.
[01:01:29.431 --> 01:01:43.176]  But it'll be out very soon, and they would just march over and threaten to arrest Rob Doom in Barcelona because the police were like 60, 70 yards away in the shot with their submachine guns at a famous cathedral.
[01:01:43.176 --> 01:01:44.596]  We were actually shooting the cathedral, not them.
[01:01:44.596 --> 01:01:51.038]  And they said, under the new rules, we can do this.
[01:01:51.038 --> 01:01:52.459]  But they bring the people in.
[01:01:55.928 --> 01:01:58.410]  Now migrant target ferries in the UK.
[01:01:58.410 --> 01:02:09.618]  Hundreds cause mile-long traffic jam before riot police surround jungle and block access to the terminal.
[01:02:09.618 --> 01:02:19.945]  And you watch these footage, I mean there are countless videos of people having their trucks carjacked, their trucks broken into, and the police will do nothing.
[01:02:19.945 --> 01:02:23.027]  Because it's politically incorrect.
[01:02:24.107 --> 01:02:24.887]  We're good to go.
[01:02:42.659 --> 01:02:53.786]  The founder of Black Lives Matter, the inspiration is on the FBI's most wanted list for killing a cop and being part of organizing the killing of other police in random murders.
[01:02:53.786 --> 01:02:58.008]  Inspiration behind Black Lives Matter is on the FBI's most wanted list, terror list.
[01:02:58.008 --> 01:03:06.033]  Convicted cop killer is BLM's ideological guru, they say.
[01:03:06.033 --> 01:03:11.376]  And again, even when these hardcore communists get control, they just want to wreck everything.
[01:03:13.063 --> 01:03:15.584]  They don't even want to maintain their control of the country.
[01:03:15.584 --> 01:03:20.527]  They just want to run it over the edge of a cliff.
[01:03:20.527 --> 01:03:31.034]  And that's why the elites themselves are having to run to out-of-the-way places and build armored fortresses to fight the policies they themselves schizophrenically brought in.
[01:03:31.034 --> 01:03:33.335]  And I'm not against the immigrants themselves.
[01:03:36.857 --> 01:03:53.458]  But I have no responsibility when somebody in North Africa or somebody in Nicaragua or somebody in Saudi Arabia or Turkey or wherever they're from wants to have seven kids and then they want to bring them here?
[01:03:53.458 --> 01:03:55.540]  And then I'm supposed to go, oh, you're a foreign culture!
[01:03:56.363 --> 01:03:59.185]  I mean, I'm actually a worldly guy, and I'm not proud of that.
[01:03:59.185 --> 01:03:59.786]  I am worldly.
[01:03:59.786 --> 01:04:02.828]  I kind of like other cultures and weird stuff and interesting people.
[01:04:02.828 --> 01:04:06.891]  I don't like run-of-the-mill, basic, you know, vanilla ice cream, one flavor.
[01:04:06.891 --> 01:04:10.554]  But man, I want to be able to do what I want, and I don't want you telling me what to do.
[01:04:10.554 --> 01:04:15.558]  And this whole leftist garbage is about saying I'm bad because
[01:04:16.741 --> 01:04:21.323]  I'm attracted to women of every color and creed, but I mean, I'll just be honest with you.
[01:04:21.323 --> 01:04:27.406]  I'm probably the most attractive, on average, to white women.
[01:04:27.406 --> 01:04:28.727]  And it's not because I'm racist.
[01:04:28.727 --> 01:04:32.789]  All the genetic studies show black people are more attractive, on average, to other black people.
[01:04:32.789 --> 01:04:35.410]  It's genetic.
[01:04:35.410 --> 01:04:38.192]  I can't say if it's blondes or brunettes.
[01:04:38.192 --> 01:04:40.453]  I mean, I can't really tell you.
[01:04:40.453 --> 01:04:43.454]  I just know that that's what I'm most attracted to.
[01:04:43.454 --> 01:04:44.515]  I see Asian women that are
[01:04:45.509 --> 01:04:49.435]  Black women that are... Hispanic women that are incredibly gorgeous.
[01:04:49.435 --> 01:04:56.564]  But at the... Deep down... I click... Am I bad for being white?
[01:04:58.792 --> 01:05:01.153]  Hey Daniels, InfoWars.com.
[01:05:01.153 --> 01:05:07.894]  The Financial Times has published an anonymous article which calls for the abolition of cash to give central banks and governments more power.
[01:05:07.894 --> 01:05:10.535]  Entitled, The Case for Retiring Another Barbarous Relic.
[01:05:10.535 --> 01:05:18.077]  The article falsely claims that when people stockpile cash in anticipation for another economic collapse, they're causing distortion to the economic system.
[01:05:18.077 --> 01:05:26.899]  Complaining that cash cannot be tracked and traced, the writer argues that abolition would make life easier for governments set on squeezing the informal economy out of existence.
[01:05:27.259 --> 01:05:34.564]  This will only enslave the public by allowing central banks and the government unparalleled ability to compensate money whenever they want through taxes and bail-ins.
[01:05:34.564 --> 01:05:35.485]  Think about this.
[01:05:35.485 --> 01:05:38.186]  It will allow them to control you by owning your paycheck.
[01:05:38.186 --> 01:05:41.629]  You know, they'll be able to prevent you from spending money whenever they want.
[01:05:41.629 --> 01:05:45.471]  And when it comes to so-called bail-ins, just look at Cyprus, for example.
[01:05:45.471 --> 01:05:54.437]  In 2013, when Cyprus' largest bank was sunk from exposure to debt-crippled Greece, the Cypriot government looted people's bank accounts as part of the bail-in program.

[01:08:01.129 --> 01:08:03.911]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:08:03.911 --> 01:08:06.714]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:16.675 --> 01:08:24.137]  Peter Schiff of Euro-Pacific Capital is going to be joining us here in just a moment and coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[01:08:24.137 --> 01:08:32.638]  We'll open the phones up for your questions for Peter Schiff, who joins us every two weeks now to break down the ongoing global collapse.
[01:08:32.638 --> 01:08:39.960]  He predicted here a few months ago on air that by the fall he expected to see a major unraveling, but he said, look,
[01:08:40.751 --> 01:08:46.215]  They can keep these plates in the air, or these balls they're juggling, for a long time.
[01:08:46.215 --> 01:08:50.678]  It might go further, but he said it's really starting to unravel.
[01:08:50.678 --> 01:08:53.280]  Well, now the Chinese have started dumping U.S.
[01:08:53.280 --> 01:08:53.841]  Treasuries.
[01:08:53.841 --> 01:08:56.162]  They're continuing to drop their currency.
[01:08:56.983 --> 01:08:58.244]  We know they're propping up the U.S.
[01:08:58.244 --> 01:08:59.065]  stock market here.
[01:08:59.065 --> 01:09:03.489]  We're going to get his take on what he thinks is unfolding here in a moment.
[01:09:03.489 --> 01:09:18.483]  And then also his take on collapsing Africa, collapsing Middle East, collapsing areas of Asia, Eastern Europe in trouble, Russia in a depression, migrants, illegal aliens, pouring in, hundreds drowning a day coming out of Africa and the Middle East.
[01:09:19.464 --> 01:09:25.488]  German towns of 1,000 people now with 1,000, 2,000, 3,000 immigrants.
[01:09:25.488 --> 01:09:30.411]  Governments in Europe, like Sweden, saying we're going to start housing them in your house.
[01:09:30.411 --> 01:09:33.033]  I mean, you talk about political correctness.
[01:09:33.033 --> 01:09:35.935]  That will only bring more people.
[01:09:35.935 --> 01:09:43.000]  But people are so politically correct, they might even say, here's my wife, here's my daughter, to prove that you're not racist.
[01:09:44.322 --> 01:09:46.563]  This is over-the-top insane.
[01:09:46.563 --> 01:09:55.048]  I have another article here in the Stack Out of Canada where they're saying, free housing for Muslims but not for Christians.
[01:09:55.048 --> 01:09:58.870]  I'm not kidding, because in the political correctness, Muslims are downtrodden.
[01:09:58.870 --> 01:10:00.831]  So, they get free stuff.
[01:10:00.831 --> 01:10:10.836]  This is all the hate speech, political correctness stuff, is really a way for communists and socialists to unevenly distribute socialist booty.
[01:10:11.758 --> 01:10:14.399]  And that always happens in collectivist regimes.
[01:10:14.399 --> 01:10:17.400]  It's selectively delivered.
[01:10:17.400 --> 01:10:20.981]  And they want the giant immigrant populations here, the good, the bad, the ugly.
[01:10:20.981 --> 01:10:22.922]  A lot of these immigrants are great people.
[01:10:22.922 --> 01:10:26.243]  I don't care if they're Muslim, I don't care if they're Christians from Mexico, whatever.
[01:10:26.243 --> 01:10:30.445]  You want to come here, work hard, prove it, become a citizen, we need you.
[01:10:30.445 --> 01:10:31.105]  Hell, we killed
[01:10:32.671 --> 01:10:36.592]  You know, half the kids we were going to have in this country since Roe v. Wade.
[01:10:36.592 --> 01:10:38.712]  Black people, white people, Hispanics.
[01:10:38.712 --> 01:10:40.192]  So we need folks.
[01:10:40.192 --> 01:10:41.593]  We killed all our kids.
[01:10:41.593 --> 01:10:47.574]  I'm not against immigration, but you can't just have it wide open and say, come up here, we'll give you something free.
[01:10:47.574 --> 01:10:48.654]  Look at these headlines.
[01:10:48.654 --> 01:10:51.735]  Swedish MP make people's garages into immigrant housing.
[01:10:51.735 --> 01:10:56.416]  New York Times, Germany's small towns fill the cost of Europe's migrant crisis.
[01:10:56.416 --> 01:10:58.136]  AFP on Lesbos Island.
[01:11:00.242 --> 01:11:04.626]  Confronts, clash with immigrant and migrant needs.
[01:11:04.626 --> 01:11:09.390]  There's 160,000 migrants just on that island.
[01:11:09.390 --> 01:11:10.331]  Migrant crisis.
[01:11:10.331 --> 01:11:15.495]  Greek ferry brings 2,500 to one port alone.
[01:11:15.495 --> 01:11:17.857]  And they just show up and say, everything's free!
[01:11:17.857 --> 01:11:19.639]  I'm here with my babies, pay for it!
[01:11:19.639 --> 01:11:22.521]  In a country already collapsing!
[01:11:22.521 --> 01:11:24.003]  What are the socialists thinking?
[01:11:25.009 --> 01:11:26.050]  They're going to cause a revolution.
[01:11:26.050 --> 01:11:29.755]  They're going to bring in folks that are going to run the revolution for them to take over.
[01:11:29.755 --> 01:11:32.518]  I mean, it's the Cloward and Piven plan.
[01:11:32.518 --> 01:11:35.081]  This isn't a game.
[01:11:35.081 --> 01:11:36.783]  So that's what we've got going on.
[01:11:36.783 --> 01:11:39.947]  Absolute treason taking place.
[01:11:39.947 --> 01:11:41.669]  Ferries being shut down in England.
[01:11:41.669 --> 01:11:42.811]  Trains being shut down.
[01:11:43.840 --> 01:11:52.422]  Because the illegals are now not just riding on the trains, they're now robbing the trains, robbing the ferries, robbing the trucks, and the police will do nothing.
[01:11:52.422 --> 01:12:06.465]  But it got so out of hand, you can go onto YouTube and just type in, uh, immigrants rob trucks in France, getting on ferry, and it's just hundreds of videos of the robbing, the stealing.
[01:12:06.465 --> 01:12:08.446]  This is the collapse of society.
[01:12:10.270 --> 01:12:31.224]  And I know Peter will say, oh well, it's the benign neglect, the elites don't care, they're in their ivory towers, they're stupid, but the Ford Foundation, Acorn, Battleground Texas, I got videos of them saying they're gonna bring in these immigrant populations, put them in Democratic and Liberal Party homes, get them on welfare, get them driver's licenses, get them voting, and then it's game over.
[01:12:31.224 --> 01:12:38.589]  They're taking our guns, they're raising taxes to 80% like France, because the elites are exempt and get away with it.
[01:12:38.589 --> 01:12:39.850]  Just like the French Socialists.
[01:12:40.370 --> 01:12:43.193]  Then we'll look at Hillary Clinton in deep trouble.
[01:12:43.193 --> 01:12:47.238]  The latest on what's happening with Donald Trump.
[01:12:47.238 --> 01:12:52.243]  I got a clip of Obama coming out and saying that guns are worse than terrorism.
[01:12:52.243 --> 01:12:56.027]  What about all the ISIS you've been funding that have killed 300,000 people, Obama?
[01:12:56.027 --> 01:12:57.209]  That's all coming up.
[01:12:59.121 --> 01:13:04.663]  Now, before we go any further, I want to tell you about our guest, Peter Schiff, EuroPAC.com.
[01:13:04.663 --> 01:13:08.804]  He's an American businessman, investment broker, author, and financial commentator.
[01:13:08.804 --> 01:13:11.285]  Of course, you see him on a lot of the big shows.
[01:13:11.285 --> 01:13:13.626]  Usually, he's the guy they're attacking.
[01:13:13.626 --> 01:13:16.087]  He also, of course, is a best-selling author.
[01:13:16.087 --> 01:13:19.868]  Again, EuroPAC.com, billions under management.
[01:13:19.868 --> 01:13:22.549]  And he's got a really accurate track record.
[01:13:22.549 --> 01:13:25.430]  I give him about a 95% accuracy in his predictions.
[01:13:26.807 --> 01:13:29.328]  I'm out here in Jackson Hole right now.
[01:13:29.328 --> 01:13:31.729]  The Federal Reserve has its annual conference here.
[01:13:47.802 --> 01:13:51.808]  And I am taking part in a kind of like a protest conference.
[01:13:51.808 --> 01:13:59.279]  You know, there's a left-wing group that's here, too, called FedUp, and they basically think the Fed has to print even more money, that they haven't done enough.
[01:13:59.279 --> 01:14:01.402]  They want even higher inflation.
[01:14:01.402 --> 01:14:02.824]  Well, I'm part of a conference.
[01:14:03.044 --> 01:14:11.468]  That's criticizing the Fed from the other perspective, from the right, talking about all the damage that the Federal Reserve has already done to the U.S.
[01:14:11.468 --> 01:14:12.168]  economy.
[01:14:12.168 --> 01:14:18.351]  In fact, the declines that we're seeing now in the stock market are not the result of what's happening in China.
[01:14:19.111 --> 01:14:25.495]  It's that we're coming closer to the time where everybody believed the Fed was about to raise interest rates.
[01:14:25.495 --> 01:14:32.540]  And so the phony bubble economy that was inflated with cheap money, the Fed was threatening to prick that bubble.
[01:14:32.540 --> 01:14:34.822]  And so that's why the market was coming down.
[01:14:34.822 --> 01:14:47.931]  But now we're starting to hear rumblings here out of Jackson Hole that maybe some more QE is coming after all, that maybe the Fed isn't going to be raising rates, which is what I've been saying the entire time, that the Fed is too committed to keep
[01:14:48.171 --> 01:14:53.459]  You said two years ago they're never going to stop QE because it's the lesser of two evils in their view.
[01:14:54.346 --> 01:14:57.067]  Well, in their view, it's actually the greater of the evils.
[01:14:57.067 --> 01:15:01.650]  But from their perspective, it keeps the bubble from collapsing now.
[01:15:01.650 --> 01:15:04.511]  It pushes the pain into the future.
[01:15:04.511 --> 01:15:12.376]  But in the present, the pain is still being felt on Main Street, even as its monetary policy keeps people on Wall Street immune.
[01:15:12.376 --> 01:15:14.136]  But I'm going to really be criticizing.
[01:15:14.136 --> 01:15:18.479]  I'm giving a keynote speech at this conference here in a couple of hours.
[01:15:19.219 --> 01:15:25.526]  And I'm really going to be talking about the damage that the Fed has done, and I'm also going to be criticizing Janet Yellen.
[01:15:25.526 --> 01:15:35.857]  And you know, I would encourage your listeners to go to my YouTube channel, Schiff Report, and look at the video, Janet Yellen Exposed.
[01:15:36.357 --> 01:15:41.303]  I did this 40-minute video when they first appointed her to chair the Federal Reserve.
[01:15:41.303 --> 01:15:49.312]  And if you remember, at that time, President Obama introduced her as the woman who warned about the financial crisis.
[01:15:49.312 --> 01:15:50.914]  She warned about the housing bubble.
[01:15:51.574 --> 01:15:59.500]  In advance, and nobody listened to her, and that's why we need her at the helm, because, you know, if she was there, then we wouldn't have had the crisis.
[01:15:59.500 --> 01:16:00.901]  The media bought that.
[01:16:00.901 --> 01:16:03.182]  It was a complete and total lie.
[01:16:03.182 --> 01:16:17.953]  I take that lie apart in my video Janet Yellen Exposed, because I go back to the very speeches that she was giving in 2005 and 2006, where everybody says she was warning about the problems, and she did no such thing.
[01:16:18.433 --> 01:16:23.759]  The only time Janet Yellen ever mentioned the housing bubble was to say that we didn't have one.
[01:16:23.759 --> 01:16:26.722]  To criticize people who thought there was a housing bubble.
[01:16:26.722 --> 01:16:32.028]  Janet Yellen in 2005 said she thought housing prices would keep going up.
[01:16:32.028 --> 01:16:34.991]  She thought that they might go up more slowly than they had in the past.
[01:16:34.991 --> 01:16:37.693]  Well sure, she's part of the whole inner circle that pushed this whole thing.
[01:16:37.693 --> 01:16:38.773]  What about this?
[01:16:38.773 --> 01:16:51.120]  There's a major split for the first time in modern history from what I've seen in the Federal Reserve with the Kansas City and the Dallas Fed pretty much sounding like you and warning this is going to bring the entire country and the economy down.
[01:16:51.120 --> 01:16:57.564]  So maybe that's why Janet Yellen and a few of the New York Fed kingpins didn't show up USA Today as reporting.
[01:16:58.575 --> 01:17:01.817]  Yeah, well Janet Yellen's not here and normally she is here.
[01:17:01.817 --> 01:17:05.019]  I don't know why she skipped it this year.
[01:17:05.019 --> 01:17:13.744]  But look, there are some people who think that the Fed should raise rates, that it's time and the economy can do well with higher rates.
[01:17:13.744 --> 01:17:19.567]  There are those that think that the Fed needs more, you know, to keep rates at zero because the economy needs more support.
[01:17:19.567 --> 01:17:21.348]  Both camps are wrong.
[01:17:21.348 --> 01:17:22.149]  They're both wrong.
[01:17:22.449 --> 01:17:26.972]  We need to raise interest rates, but that's going to cause the economy to implode.
[01:17:26.972 --> 01:17:31.114]  But we have to implode it anyway, because it's a bubble.
[01:17:31.114 --> 01:17:40.100]  Until we let this bubble pop, and until we finish the financial crisis that we started in 2008, we're never going to have a real recovery.
[01:17:40.100 --> 01:17:46.464]  That's right, but they want to keep picking the winners, so they want to keep the bubble going forever, even though the bubble is eating the world.
[01:17:47.213 --> 01:17:49.054]  Yes, the bubble is the problem.
[01:17:49.054 --> 01:17:58.301]  So we have to end the stimulus so the market can solve the problems that the Fed is continuing to cause with its reckless monetary policy.
[01:17:58.301 --> 01:18:04.846]  Unfortunately, though, I think this policy is going to continue and ultimately it's going to destroy the dollar.
[01:18:04.846 --> 01:18:08.869]  And you know, the Chinese you talked about, hey, they're starting to sell some treasuries.
[01:18:08.869 --> 01:18:11.051]  Well, they got a lot more treasuries to sell.
[01:18:11.051 --> 01:18:13.293]  The whole world has got treasuries to sell.
[01:18:13.513 --> 01:18:14.416]  Who's gonna buy them?
[01:18:14.416 --> 01:18:20.194]  And you've always said when they start selling the treasuries and everybody else jumps on the bandwagon, that could be the end of the dollar.
[01:18:20.930 --> 01:18:25.673]  Well, look, who's going to buy all these treasuries that everybody wants to unload?
[01:18:25.673 --> 01:18:27.935]  The Fed is the only buyer in town.
[01:18:27.935 --> 01:18:29.396]  And where are they going to get the money?
[01:18:29.396 --> 01:18:30.616]  They're going to print it.
[01:18:30.616 --> 01:18:35.039]  And so what's that money going to be worth after they print it by, you know, the truckload?
[01:18:35.039 --> 01:18:40.323]  Not very much, which is why people have to do something I've talked about on your show before.
[01:18:40.323 --> 01:18:45.466]  Take advantage of this sucker's rally in the dollar and sell your dollars to the suckers.
[01:18:45.466 --> 01:18:48.869]  You know, that's what we're doing with my clients at Euro Pacific Capital.
[01:18:48.869 --> 01:18:50.850]  We're helping them buy assets in
[01:18:51.050 --> 01:18:51.710]  We're good to go.
[01:19:06.155 --> 01:19:06.935]  I don't know.
[01:19:31.505 --> 01:19:32.005]  Sure.
[01:19:32.005 --> 01:19:34.006]  I mean, we're going to go to break, but here's the question.
[01:19:34.006 --> 01:19:34.666]  Answer it when we come back.
[01:19:34.666 --> 01:19:35.566]  Peter Schiff's our guest.
[01:19:35.566 --> 01:19:36.447]  You're at Pacific Capital.
[01:19:36.447 --> 01:19:38.107]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:19:38.107 --> 01:19:41.088]  We're talking about the worldwide meltdown that's happening.
[01:19:41.088 --> 01:19:52.693]  If this signals people starting to move away from the dollar, then will it get to anything like we saw Weimar Republic if they decide to start buying their own debt?
[01:19:52.693 --> 01:19:56.114]  I mean, they've already been doing it, but if it accelerates, how bad could it get?
[01:19:58.908 --> 01:20:01.729]  This hour of GCN brought to you by Lissig.

[01:21:57.896 --> 01:22:02.140]  As if chlorine in our water weren't bad enough, now they're adding ammonia?
[01:22:02.140 --> 01:22:02.760]  It's true.
[01:22:02.760 --> 01:22:06.924]  Some municipalities are now adding ammonia plus chlorine to your water supply.
[01:22:06.924 --> 01:22:09.327]  It's a disinfectant called chloramine.
[01:22:09.327 --> 01:22:13.791]  But with a trusted Big Berkey water filter, you can keep chloramine out of your water.

[01:23:07.036 --> 01:23:12.499]  They've got hordes of salesmen out there trying to scare you into signing one of their long-term contracts.

[01:24:20.596 --> 01:24:27.181]  If you go to DrudgeReport.com, you can see two InfoWars articles that are very important.
[01:24:27.181 --> 01:24:29.602]  One of them I'm going to ask Peter Schiff about in a moment.
[01:24:29.602 --> 01:24:33.785]  The Financial Times of London calls for abolishing cash.
[01:24:33.785 --> 01:24:43.291]  And we see huge pushes by the private central banks, by the big five banks to get rid of cash, because then they can take whatever they want out of our bank accounts, they can track everything we do.
[01:24:43.291 --> 01:24:43.932]  It is such
[01:24:45.401 --> 01:24:45.982]  We're good to go.
[01:25:08.274 --> 01:25:10.416]  The question is, how is it going to happen?
[01:25:10.416 --> 01:25:11.457]  What will it look like?
[01:25:11.457 --> 01:25:15.041]  So that's a segue into my question.
[01:25:15.041 --> 01:25:23.270]  This sounds like that we're going to at least have devaluations of the dollar down the road, similar to what we've seen with Mexican peso.
[01:25:23.270 --> 01:25:26.313]  Could it go as bad as Weimar, Germany or Zimbabwe?
[01:25:27.234 --> 01:25:36.963]  situation because the numbers, correct me if I'm wrong, historically we've already devalued the dollar more than they have their currencies historically.
[01:25:36.963 --> 01:25:41.287]  It's just that people are still accepting it on our faith and credit.
[01:25:42.230 --> 01:25:47.573]  Yeah, you know, a Walmart Republic situation, that's always the worst case scenario.
[01:25:47.573 --> 01:25:49.654]  I mean, I don't know if it's the most probable.
[01:25:49.654 --> 01:25:52.595]  In fact, I don't think it's the most likely scenario.
[01:25:52.595 --> 01:25:55.337]  I don't think the dollar is going to be worthless.
[01:25:55.337 --> 01:25:57.678]  But I do believe it's going to be worth a lot less.
[01:25:58.218 --> 01:25:59.139]  That it is now.
[01:25:59.139 --> 01:26:04.405]  You know, there was an expression around, you know, after the revolution, not worth the continental.
[01:26:04.405 --> 01:26:11.052]  A lot of people don't know that, you know, we experimented with paper money before the founding fathers put us on the gold standard.
[01:26:11.052 --> 01:26:17.459]  And the reason they said not worth the continental is because continental currency, which was not backed by gold and silver, collapsed.
[01:26:17.879 --> 01:26:23.743]  And people eventually lost about 90% of their value in the Continentals.
[01:26:23.743 --> 01:26:27.525]  And so the Founding Fathers had a bad taste in their mouth from paper money.
[01:26:27.525 --> 01:26:37.611]  And you know, as bad as paper money is, you know, it's better to at least have cash than the computer entries that the government wants us to have because then they can track our every movement.
[01:26:37.611 --> 01:26:43.855]  Then it makes it easier for them to control the economy if they know every dime that you have and every place that you spend it.
[01:26:43.855 --> 01:26:47.457]  At least once you have their cash, it's kind of an anonymous transaction.
[01:26:47.517 --> 01:26:51.055]  Sure, it's designed to knock out underground economies that are key during tyranny.
[01:26:51.806 --> 01:27:03.193]  Yeah, and so, you know, that's what, look, I tell people, look, you know, forget about even keep gold and silver, you know, instead of, instead of, they're not going to be able to do anything about that, you know, and the price is ultimately going to go a lot higher.
[01:27:03.193 --> 01:27:10.838]  But look, the dollar has risen recently because everybody believes that the economy is down and we're going to raise rates.
[01:27:10.838 --> 01:27:13.360]  They haven't figured out reality yet.
[01:27:13.360 --> 01:27:14.180]  They never do.
[01:27:14.180 --> 01:27:16.602]  They never see these bubbles until after they pop.
[01:27:18.123 --> 01:27:18.663]  Sure.
[01:27:18.663 --> 01:27:18.844]  Sure.
[01:27:40.260 --> 01:27:47.622]  It is going to turn as people realize that we're not going to get the right hikes, that we're going to get more quantitative easing.
[01:27:47.622 --> 01:27:55.964]  And then if China selling its treasuries, is this just the beginning of a snowball that's going to get bigger and bigger?
[01:27:55.964 --> 01:28:01.525]  Because once China starts selling, what do you do if you're another country and you own U.S.
[01:28:01.525 --> 01:28:03.566]  treasuries and you know China's selling?
[01:28:03.566 --> 01:28:03.886]  Sure.
[01:28:03.886 --> 01:28:05.146]  You want to get out quick.
[01:28:05.146 --> 01:28:07.227]  You don't want to wait till China's finished selling.
[01:28:07.227 --> 01:28:08.047]  So I'm not wrong.
[01:28:09.227 --> 01:28:12.829]  This is a big, big deal that China's starting to dump treasuries.
[01:28:12.829 --> 01:28:14.510]  Yeah, and people are dismissing this.
[01:28:14.510 --> 01:28:15.751]  People are laughing.
[01:28:15.751 --> 01:28:19.934]  Oh, you see, China's selling their treasuries and it's no big deal.
[01:28:19.934 --> 01:28:23.115]  It is premature to say it's no big deal.
[01:28:23.115 --> 01:28:24.716]  It just started.
[01:28:24.716 --> 01:28:31.901]  And look, if China's not going to be buying our treasuries, if they're going to be selling our treasuries, who is going to step up to the plate?
[01:28:31.901 --> 01:28:33.682]  Who is going to take over for China?
[01:28:33.682 --> 01:28:35.303]  Can anybody figure that out?
[01:28:36.857 --> 01:28:41.820]  Now obviously behind all of this is the fact there is a global slowdown.
[01:28:41.820 --> 01:28:43.681]  How bad do you think the slowdown is going to get?
[01:28:43.681 --> 01:28:47.303]  We've got Africa and the Middle East just emptying out into Europe.
[01:28:47.303 --> 01:28:48.824]  It is getting crazy.
[01:28:48.824 --> 01:28:50.505]  How does that compound the situation?
[01:28:51.360 --> 01:28:58.586]  Well, I think the slowdown is being compounded by the belief that the Fed is going to be tightening monetary policy after seven years of zero.
[01:28:58.586 --> 01:29:02.370]  This impacts the entire world because the dollar is the reserve currency.
[01:29:02.370 --> 01:29:06.694]  But I think people are preparing for a tightening cycle that's not going to take place.
[01:29:06.694 --> 01:29:12.439]  All this capital is being sucked out of the emerging economies and out of commodities that's moving into the U.S.
[01:29:12.439 --> 01:29:16.803]  financial markets because it's ready for, you know, higher interest rates.
[01:29:17.443 --> 01:29:19.304]  That's slowing down the global economy.
[01:29:19.304 --> 01:29:34.176]  When people realize that that's a mistake, and the dollar starts to tank, and commodity prices start to go back up, and money is repatriated back to the countries that it left chasing dollars, that is going to be a relief for the global economy.
[01:29:34.176 --> 01:29:44.023]  But there are certainly parts of the world, parts of Europe, Japan, United States, that have too much government, too much regulation, too much money printing, too much interference.
[01:29:44.023 --> 01:29:46.225]  These countries are never going to truly recover
[01:29:46.465 --> 01:29:47.226]  Let's talk about it!
[01:29:58.792 --> 01:30:01.154]  Hey Daniels, InfoWars.com.
[01:30:01.154 --> 01:30:07.900]  The Financial Times has published an anonymous article which calls for the abolition of cash to give central banks and governments more power.
[01:30:07.900 --> 01:30:10.562]  Entitled, The Case for Retiring Another Barbarous Relic.
[01:30:10.562 --> 01:30:18.088]  The article falsely claims that when people stockpile cash in anticipation for another economic collapse, they're causing distortion to the economic system.
[01:30:18.088 --> 01:30:26.916]  Complaining that cash cannot be tracked and traced, the writer argues that abolition would make life easier for governments set on squeezing the informal economy out of existence.
[01:30:27.256 --> 01:30:34.581]  This will only enslave the public by allowing central banks and the government unparalleled ability to compensate money whenever they want through taxes and bail-ins.
[01:30:34.581 --> 01:30:35.482]  Think about this.
[01:30:35.482 --> 01:30:38.203]  It will allow them to control you by owning your paycheck.
[01:30:38.203 --> 01:30:41.626]  You know, they'll be able to prevent you from spending money whenever they want.
[01:30:41.626 --> 01:30:46.109]  And when it comes to so-called bail-ins, just look at Cyprus, for example.
[01:30:46.109 --> 01:30:54.434]  In 2013, when Cyprus' largest bank was sunk from exposure to debt-crippled Greece, the Cypriot government looted people's bank accounts as part of the bail-in program.
[01:30:54.434 --> 01:30:56.916]  You can find more reports at InfoWars.com.

[01:33:08.447 --> 01:33:13.329]  Well, so does he.
[01:33:13.329 --> 01:33:19.652]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:19.652 --> 01:33:21.613]  Ladies and gentlemen, I'll tell you a bottom line.
[01:33:21.613 --> 01:33:24.974]  Now is the time to start getting prepared.
[01:33:24.974 --> 01:33:27.795]  Psychologically, financially, physically.
[01:33:27.795 --> 01:33:31.697]  Because the world is going into a depression.
[01:33:31.697 --> 01:33:34.818]  And if it's anything like the Great Depression, it will be spectacular.
[01:33:34.818 --> 01:33:36.739]  Because the public is so, on average,
[01:33:38.698 --> 01:33:40.480]  Unprepared to take care of themselves.
[01:33:40.480 --> 01:33:43.542]  I mean, back in the 30s, you could work on your own car.
[01:33:43.542 --> 01:33:44.883]  Most people had their own gardens.
[01:33:44.883 --> 01:33:46.745]  I'm not going to belabor that point.
[01:33:46.745 --> 01:33:47.385]  People know that.
[01:33:48.257 --> 01:34:12.632]  This goes from bad to worse, and I want to ask Peter Schiff how bad he thinks it could really get here in a moment, where he thinks the third world is going, what he predicts the Fed will do, because they are now hinting, saying they may not raise rates, or it may be a tiny raise, or they may go down, and Larry Summers is running around saying that's the answer, and criticizing Yellen, so they want to have their cake and eat it too, have people
[01:34:13.848 --> 01:34:20.251]  I believe that interest rates are going up, and I guess in the real world for us they have some, but not for the establishment.
[01:34:20.251 --> 01:34:22.512]  They want to have their cake and eat it too.
[01:34:22.512 --> 01:34:27.494]  The toll-free number to join us, your questions for Peter Schiff and of course myself, Alex Jones, are 800-259-9231.
[01:34:27.494 --> 01:34:29.655]  800-259-9231 for this Friday Worldwide Edition.
[01:34:29.655 --> 01:34:30.676]  And I'll be back this Sunday.
[01:34:39.640 --> 01:34:40.320]  4 to 6 p.m.
[01:34:40.320 --> 01:34:50.404]  Central with the abbreviated two-hour transmission live as well and of course the nightly news tonight at PrisonPlanet.tv and InfoWarsNews.com.
[01:34:50.404 --> 01:34:57.007]  The daytime radio show slash TV show has a free feed at InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[01:34:57.007 --> 01:34:59.068]  Please spread that around to friends and family.
[01:34:59.068 --> 01:35:06.151]  We have the free podcast, Droid and iPhone apps and much more right there at InfoWars.com forward slash show.

[01:35:23.144 --> 01:35:27.546]  So I want to thank all the members of PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:35:27.546 --> 01:35:29.727]  You make so much of what we're doing possible.
[01:35:30.727 --> 01:35:34.809]  Also, we're going to end this special today because supplies are so limited.
[01:35:34.809 --> 01:35:36.090]  I don't want to sell out.
[01:35:36.090 --> 01:35:37.871]  It'll go back to the regular price this weekend.
[01:35:37.871 --> 01:35:44.655]  It's still very affordable for some of the most high-quality, low-priced cloyal silver out there.
[01:35:44.655 --> 01:35:49.918]  An amazing alternative to antibiotics, in my opinion, my view, it's what I use it for.
[01:35:49.918 --> 01:35:58.522]  Topically, you name it, it's been known for thousands of years and the scientists and doctors we've had on believe 30 parts per million is the best.
[01:36:00.603 --> 01:36:04.705]  More than that, it's just too small and becomes toxic, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:36:04.705 --> 01:36:05.766]  And that's our view.
[01:36:05.766 --> 01:36:09.287]  Talk to your physician, do your own research.
[01:36:09.287 --> 01:36:14.089]  30% off a single bottle, 50% off when you get two bottles.
[01:36:14.089 --> 01:36:17.151]  Basically, you get two bottles, you get two free, to be technical.
[01:36:17.151 --> 01:36:20.832]  So, 30% off one bottle, or buy two, get two free.
[01:36:20.832 --> 01:36:23.673]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:36:23.673 --> 01:36:26.875]  And we do have our amazing medical grade methylcobalamin.
[01:36:28.220 --> 01:36:30.924]  Vitamin B12, that's true, organic.
[01:36:32.284 --> 01:36:33.044]  Vitamin B12.
[01:36:33.044 --> 01:36:36.826]  You will not find it basically anywhere, especially in this dose.
[01:36:36.826 --> 01:36:45.049]  This is the same stuff that I went to a medical doctor to get, because I wanted to experience that, injectable into the fat.
[01:36:45.049 --> 01:36:47.270]  Same color, same stuff, same thing.
[01:36:47.270 --> 01:36:49.531]  This is a pharmaceutical grade when you take it under your tongue.
[01:36:49.531 --> 01:36:51.371]  You do not inject it.
[01:36:51.371 --> 01:36:55.993]  And it is simply amazing the natural clean energy you get from it.
[01:36:55.993 --> 01:36:58.094]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:37:02.299 --> 01:37:17.310]  And when you purchase the products at InfoWarsLife.com or InfoWarsStore.com for that matter, the water filtration, the non-GMO seeds, the shortwave radios, the high-quality storable foods from My Patriot Supply, a portion of that again goes to fund this operation.
[01:37:17.310 --> 01:37:25.236]  Even when we drop ship stuff like the water filters or the high-quality storable foods, you're directly helping fund InfoWars
[01:37:26.308 --> 01:37:29.369]  And the entire operation that's reaching people exponentially.
[01:37:29.369 --> 01:37:32.009]  So thank you so much for supporting the operation.
[01:37:32.009 --> 01:37:39.051]  But you are getting high quality products that we've vetted, that we've researched at the very lowest prices that we can competitively put them out.
[01:37:39.051 --> 01:37:54.455]  I mean, I have to sign special contracts to be able to give 10% off the ProPure water filters that cut out the glyphosates, the fluoride and the rest of it because we do sell it at the lowest price because we are the biggest distributor in the world of a major company.
[01:37:55.379 --> 01:38:04.135]  Because when I started promoting them three years ago, four years ago, I said I'm not going to carry it unless I get lower prices than basically anybody else.
[01:38:04.135 --> 01:38:05.398]  That's just a free market tactic.
[01:38:08.228 --> 01:38:21.395]  And I went out and researched filters, and because I've had a few other companies, and they just weren't as good as they used to be, so I, in my view, my opinion, and I went and saw the side-by-side studies on ProPure G2 and other systems they sell, and it's just the best for the price.
[01:38:21.395 --> 01:38:26.778]  InfowarsStore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:38:26.778 --> 01:38:30.420]  Okay, going back to our guest, Peter Schiff.
[01:38:30.420 --> 01:38:35.362]  You can read all of his analysis and more at Europack.com.
[01:38:35.362 --> 01:38:36.123]  He joins us.
[01:38:37.313 --> 01:38:39.293]  How concerned should I be?
[01:38:39.293 --> 01:38:41.794]  Obviously things are unraveling quickly.
[01:38:41.794 --> 01:38:44.734]  A recession here is just painful.
[01:38:44.734 --> 01:38:55.577]  But when you see what's happening over in the Middle East, Africa, areas of Asia, Latin America, seems like the whole world's imploding.
[01:38:55.577 --> 01:39:01.118]  But meanwhile they go on the news and make fun of you and others and say there's no problem anywhere, everything's fine.
[01:39:01.118 --> 01:39:02.018]  What's the reality?
[01:39:02.756 --> 01:39:07.999]  Well, there are problems everywhere, but unfortunately a lot of those problems emanate from here.
[01:39:07.999 --> 01:39:18.464]  The problem is that the dollar is acting as the reserve currency for the world, and it's prisoning the monetary systems around the world, because the dollar cannot be the reserve currency.
[01:39:18.464 --> 01:39:21.886]  It could initially, when America was the world's largest, you know,
[01:39:22.346 --> 01:39:36.334]  We were a creditor when we were exporting manufactured goods around the world, when we were loaning money to everybody because we had enormous surpluses, we had small government, we had productive people, we had a free market economy, we were on the gold standard.
[01:39:36.334 --> 01:39:41.157]  That was fine back then, but America has nothing in common with its former self.
[01:39:41.497 --> 01:39:43.619]  You know, we're a basket case now.
[01:39:43.619 --> 01:39:46.783]  We have all these debts, all these taxes and regulations.
[01:39:46.783 --> 01:39:48.184]  We're not on a gold standard.
[01:39:48.184 --> 01:39:51.167]  The dollar can't act as a reserve currency.
[01:39:51.167 --> 01:39:53.309]  And so that system has to come to an end.
[01:39:53.309 --> 01:40:00.377]  And I think what we're seeing now, we're witnessing the death throes of that system as the world is going to ultimately be moving away.
[01:40:00.777 --> 01:40:08.205]  And I think China, you know, moving to allow its currency to trade more freely, starting to sell off its huge cache of U.S.
[01:40:08.205 --> 01:40:12.670]  Treasuries is a big step, a first step in that direction.
[01:40:12.670 --> 01:40:15.714]  And at the end, it's going to be very painful for Americans.
[01:40:15.714 --> 01:40:20.940]  And if you think this recovery was bad, wait till you see how bad the next recession is going to be.
[01:40:23.646 --> 01:40:25.307]  Peter Schiff is our guest.
[01:40:25.307 --> 01:40:30.732]  I've been asking a lot of the questions here and I want to go to some phone calls so they can ask questions, but what else are you looking at?
[01:40:30.732 --> 01:40:32.894]  What else is on your front burner right now?
[01:40:34.261 --> 01:40:45.311]  Well, I think right now it's what's going to happen with the monetary policy and are people going to finally figure out what I've been saying that the Fed's been bluffing.
[01:40:45.311 --> 01:40:51.237]  And even if the Fed ultimately says it's not going to raise rates, they're not going to admit that they never intended to.
[01:40:51.237 --> 01:40:52.638]  People have to figure that out.
[01:40:52.638 --> 01:40:54.259]  People have to connect these dots.
[01:40:54.259 --> 01:40:57.823]  And, you know, they're actually pretty easy to connect if you bother to look at it.
[01:40:58.343 --> 01:41:06.365]  And so I just look at this window of opportunity here for my clients and for prospective clients to get out now, right?
[01:41:06.365 --> 01:41:09.426]  To get out of Dodds before the shooting really starts.
[01:41:09.426 --> 01:41:18.768]  Getting rid of dollars and buying these foreign assets and taking advantage of other people's ignorance of what's really going on to buy the things that they're selling.
[01:41:21.570 --> 01:41:23.071]  What's the next shoe to drop?
[01:41:23.071 --> 01:41:32.637]  Because you were on a few months ago, you're on of course six, seven, eight, nine years ago, but you've been coming on four or five times a year forever, now just intensifying because things are building towards the head.
[01:41:32.637 --> 01:41:40.082]  But if we go back to just a month ago, two months ago, you basically called what we now see happening.
[01:41:40.082 --> 01:41:47.307]  People like Harry Dent has called it accurately in many ways, but he thought gold would be going down more by now.
[01:41:47.307 --> 01:41:49.128]  You've been proven correct, it's gone up some.
[01:41:49.128 --> 01:41:49.469]  He thinks
[01:41:50.509 --> 01:41:54.352]  In the next six months or so, it'll start going down.
[01:41:54.352 --> 01:41:57.015]  But overall, you've been pretty much dead on.
[01:41:57.015 --> 01:42:03.580]  What factors are you looking at now that signal how fast this bubble collapse could go?
[01:42:03.580 --> 01:42:06.542]  I mean, are we just seeing the beginnings of the end of the dollar?
[01:42:06.542 --> 01:42:08.584]  Does it take a month, six months, five years?
[01:42:09.500 --> 01:42:16.684]  Well, what's happened more recently since the last time I was on your show is we've decisively broken the uptrend in the U.S.
[01:42:16.684 --> 01:42:23.988]  stock market that began on the lows back in 2009, and we've had a bounce back in the last few days.
[01:42:23.988 --> 01:42:34.875]  You know, we had the biggest drop point-wise ever in several days and the biggest rally, but that rally didn't change the technical damage that was done in the sell-off, so I think we've broken
[01:42:35.575 --> 01:42:35.895]  I think?
[01:43:02.918 --> 01:43:07.341]  There's about a third of the S&P 500 that's already in a bear market.
[01:43:07.341 --> 01:43:28.295]  These stocks have already dropped by 20% or more, but this is being masked by the averages, and the averages, of course, are going to be influenced by some of these high-profile names that in many cases are extremely overvalued and vulnerable to big declines if the Fed were to actually follow through with its threats to raise interest rates.
[01:43:28.295 --> 01:43:32.298]  So this decline in the stock market, of course, is putting added pressure
[01:43:33.118 --> 01:43:40.223]  On the Fed because they work so hard to inflate this bubble and now we're watching the air come out and they haven't even pricked it yet.
[01:43:40.223 --> 01:43:57.194]  So I think they're going to try to stop the air from coming out and blow more back in by softening their talk about rate hikes and then ultimately coming clean about the fact that we're going to get another injection of quantitative easing and I think this next round
[01:43:57.674 --> 01:44:01.135]  It's going to be a stampede to get out of the dollar and you want to get out before the crowd.
[01:44:14.463 --> 01:44:18.745]  I tell you, the fundamentals of the economy are not in good shape.
[01:44:18.745 --> 01:44:22.146]  I don't have to be a rocket scientist or an economist to see that.
[01:44:22.146 --> 01:44:29.948]  And I just don't think the public is ready for the type of downturn we're obviously going to be seeing here in the next few months, the next few years.
[01:44:29.948 --> 01:44:32.529]  What do you expect to see socially out of this?
[01:44:32.529 --> 01:44:35.690]  With all the turmoil, government is helping stir up.
[01:44:35.690 --> 01:44:42.993]  Why would government want to stir up turmoil when that only hurts the situation more?
[01:44:43.700 --> 01:44:46.441]  Well, you know, they don't want to waste a crisis.
[01:44:46.441 --> 01:44:52.883]  I mean, they thrive on this because they create turmoil and then government holds itself up as the solution, right?
[01:44:52.883 --> 01:45:00.025]  That's how they usurp more power, scaring the public into thinking that government is going to protect them from all the problems.
[01:45:00.025 --> 01:45:05.466]  But, you know, hopefully at some point people will recognize that government is the problem, not the solution.
[01:45:05.466 --> 01:45:10.648]  But that's why guys like Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders, they can tap into this dissatisfaction.
[01:45:11.068 --> 01:45:13.069]  People are looking for scapegoats, right?
[01:45:13.069 --> 01:45:16.752]  Donald Trump can talk about the immigrants and try to blame our problems on them.
[01:45:16.752 --> 01:45:21.635]  And there are a lot of people that want to accept that because it seems like an easy scapegoat.
[01:45:21.635 --> 01:45:29.599]  And yes, we can just solve our problems by building a wall or deporting people, but that's not even going to scratch the surface of what our real problems are.
[01:45:29.599 --> 01:45:29.920]  I agree.
[01:45:29.920 --> 01:45:33.522]  And of course, you've got Bernie Sanders just saying, well, let's just redistribute the wealth.
[01:45:33.522 --> 01:45:35.743]  There's not going to be any wealth left to redistribute.
[01:45:35.743 --> 01:45:35.903]  Exactly.
[01:45:35.903 --> 01:45:37.004]  We need to create wealth.
[01:45:39.329 --> 01:45:59.308]  I mean, as you said, deporting a bunch of illegals isn't going to fix anything, but at the same time, it's outrageous to ship them in, let them have babies for free when I can't go to their country and do that, and then the Democrats are creating a new socialist underclass to kind of be used for low-level jobs, but also
[01:46:00.009 --> 01:46:07.134]  Yeah, but Alex, you know, when my grandparents came here, all four of my grandparents immigrated legally, and of course it was a lot easier to immigrate legally back then, but there was no welfare.
[01:46:23.686 --> 01:46:25.407]  There was no nothing.
[01:46:25.407 --> 01:46:26.728]  There were no government programs at all.
[01:46:26.728 --> 01:46:27.688]  There were no food stamps.
[01:46:27.688 --> 01:46:29.490]  There was no housing vouchers.
[01:46:29.490 --> 01:46:32.311]  My parents, my grandparents came here in search of freedom.
[01:46:32.311 --> 01:46:33.512]  That's what we want.
[01:46:33.512 --> 01:46:35.333]  So, let's turn off the magnets.
[01:46:35.333 --> 01:46:36.894]  Let's get rid of welfare.
[01:46:36.894 --> 01:46:38.515]  Get rid of these programs.
[01:46:38.515 --> 01:46:41.917]  And I don't just object to illegal immigrants getting welfare.
[01:46:41.917 --> 01:46:43.338]  I don't want legal immigrants.
[01:46:43.338 --> 01:46:45.039]  Corporations, get rid of it!
[01:46:45.039 --> 01:46:48.641]  Well, I mean, there shouldn't be federal welfare.
[01:46:48.641 --> 01:46:50.783]  You're supposed to have local welfare and the churches.
[01:46:51.647 --> 01:46:53.749]  Yeah, we don't want it for anybody.
[01:46:53.749 --> 01:46:56.411]  I want people to come to this country to work.
[01:46:56.411 --> 01:46:59.293]  Not to live off the government.
[01:46:59.293 --> 01:47:02.715]  But I'm upset when native-born Americans live off the government.
[01:47:02.715 --> 01:47:05.277]  We can't just blame these problems on the immigrants.
[01:47:05.277 --> 01:47:11.001]  And even if we got all the illegal immigrants out of this country, we would be in just as bad a shape as we are now.
[01:47:11.001 --> 01:47:12.723]  In fact, it might even be worse.
[01:47:12.723 --> 01:47:14.384]  It'd probably be worse, because most of them work.
[01:47:14.384 --> 01:47:15.345]  Most of them are working hard.
[01:47:16.897 --> 01:47:17.997]  A lot of them are working hard.
[01:47:17.997 --> 01:47:18.697]  It's true.
[01:47:18.697 --> 01:47:22.098]  It's just they're being turned into a political army to vote to take the guns.
[01:47:22.098 --> 01:47:23.419]  That's why I'm so against them.
[01:47:23.419 --> 01:47:25.439]  But they do contribute in many ways.
[01:47:25.439 --> 01:47:26.379]  It's the political bent.
[01:47:26.379 --> 01:47:39.843]  I want to go to calls here, but since you raise these points about policies and where things are going, what do you think about the Hillary Clinton situation in your gut?
[01:47:39.843 --> 01:47:41.223]  I think Trump's for real now.
[01:47:41.223 --> 01:47:43.504]  I mean, I've been watching this enough.
[01:47:43.504 --> 01:47:44.404]  Where do you think that's going?
[01:47:45.213 --> 01:47:48.896]  Well, you know, Trump is for real when we have a big field.
[01:47:48.896 --> 01:47:55.802]  I think if the field of establishment candidates narrows down, you know, I don't know how much greater his support is going to rise.
[01:47:55.802 --> 01:47:57.824]  I mean, he might be near a ceiling.
[01:47:57.824 --> 01:48:05.350]  And so when it whittles down, I think that, you know, he won't necessarily have the majority in order to get that nomination.
[01:48:05.350 --> 01:48:05.951]  But who knows?
[01:48:05.951 --> 01:48:07.712]  Like, anything is possible, right?
[01:48:07.712 --> 01:48:09.194]  The situation is pretty bad.
[01:48:09.554 --> 01:48:15.319]  Hillary Clinton, you know, she is a very flawed candidate if she gets this nomination.
[01:48:15.319 --> 01:48:18.982]  And I think she's very beatable because of all of her baggage.
[01:48:18.982 --> 01:48:20.263]  I mean, she should be in jail.
[01:48:20.263 --> 01:48:21.864]  She should be running for president.
[01:48:21.864 --> 01:48:26.988]  And if she was a normal person, she probably would already be, you know, charged with a crime.
[01:48:26.988 --> 01:48:33.854]  Whether it's obstruction of justice or perjury or any of the other things that she's done that are illegal.
[01:48:33.854 --> 01:48:36.116]  She told her minions lies, suborning perjury.
[01:48:36.903 --> 01:48:40.025]  Yeah, I mean, look, you know, she's a very beatable candidate.
[01:48:40.025 --> 01:48:43.268]  So if the Democrats were smart, they would do something.
[01:48:43.268 --> 01:48:49.133]  I mean, Joe Biden is probably, I bet that the Republicans would rather run against Hillary than a Joe Biden.
[01:48:49.133 --> 01:48:53.376]  I mean, people may kind of make fun of Biden, but you know, you know, there's a lot of sympathy for him now.
[01:48:53.376 --> 01:48:54.557]  His son Beau died.
[01:48:54.557 --> 01:48:55.818]  I mean, I, you know, you know,
[01:48:56.598 --> 01:49:01.340]  I think Biden is probably a bigger threat to whoever the Republicans nominate.
[01:49:01.340 --> 01:49:03.521]  I mean, Bernie Sanders would be a gift.
[01:49:03.521 --> 01:49:05.682]  I mean, if we could run against Bernie Sanders.
[01:49:05.682 --> 01:49:08.543]  But I don't know if even the Democrats are dumb enough.
[01:49:08.543 --> 01:49:09.983]  Sure, I don't know if I agree with you, though.
[01:49:09.983 --> 01:49:17.246]  I mean, I agree Biden is slicker, has less baggage, and kind of gets to the blue collar workers and people.
[01:49:17.246 --> 01:49:20.127]  But Hillary is a woman.
[01:49:20.127 --> 01:49:23.748]  And they can just hype, she's a woman, vote for a woman.
[01:49:23.748 --> 01:49:25.249]  I think that really is a Trump card.
[01:49:25.711 --> 01:49:31.305]  Well, maybe the best thing we could do then, you know, Carly Fiorina, I don't know if she's been on your show.
[01:49:31.305 --> 01:49:32.367]  She was on my show.
[01:49:32.367 --> 01:49:32.868]  I like her.
[01:49:32.868 --> 01:49:33.650]  I mean, she's a smart...
[01:49:35.316 --> 01:49:46.621]  You know, and so, I mean, any who, I mean, if you had her against Hillary, I mean, you know, you take away the woman advantage and now, you know, it's going to be a woman president no matter who you vote for.
[01:49:46.621 --> 01:49:48.361]  So now it's who's more competent.
[01:49:48.361 --> 01:49:57.065]  And I think if it's a race about competence and intelligence and real resumes, you know, I think Carly beats out Hillary any day.
[01:49:57.185 --> 01:50:01.446]  Sure, she's run major companies and hired tens of thousands of people and made billions of dollars.
[01:50:01.446 --> 01:50:04.047]  All Hillary Clinton's done is go around and commit crimes.
[01:50:04.047 --> 01:50:07.628]  We're going to go to break and talk to Sherry, Aaron, Peter, Rob, Adam.
[01:50:07.628 --> 01:50:10.088]  I know you're getting ready to go give a big speech.
[01:50:10.088 --> 01:50:11.749]  Maybe you can stay five minutes to the next hour.
[01:50:11.749 --> 01:50:16.410]  If you can't, I understand, but I want to be able to get to at least five or six of these calls with Peter Schiff.
[01:50:16.410 --> 01:50:17.250]  Thank you, sir.
[01:50:17.250 --> 01:50:23.112]  And then we've got your website, of course, Europack.com, and we're just waiting for the next shoe to drop.
[01:50:23.112 --> 01:50:23.892]  Again, Peter Schiff.
[01:50:24.792 --> 01:50:30.718]  Is our guest and you know, he's really accurate other than saying he thought the bubble would pop about a year ago
[01:50:31.750 --> 01:50:34.132]  And then now it's popping now.
[01:50:34.132 --> 01:50:38.496]  So they really attacked him on TV news for prematurely predicting it.
[01:50:38.496 --> 01:50:43.221]  I mean, this thing is so giant, so out of control, so crazy, I don't know when it's going to pop.
[01:50:43.221 --> 01:50:48.165]  But it's kind of like you're standing on top of a volcano and it's rumbling and some lava is starting to bubble.
[01:50:48.165 --> 01:50:50.567]  I mean, is it going to erupt today or six months from now?
[01:50:50.567 --> 01:50:51.548]  I don't know.
[01:50:51.548 --> 01:50:54.371]  But I'm moving away from the volcano.
[01:50:54.371 --> 01:50:57.674]  And Peter Schiff told us it was going to start erupting, and it is.

[01:54:03.385 --> 01:54:17.291]  You take a private federal reserve, put them in control, and you see what you see now.
[01:54:17.291 --> 01:54:22.934]  When the chickens come home to roost on this bubble, on the derivatives, it's gonna be spectacular.
[01:54:24.227 --> 01:54:30.750]  And we just sit here and watch it with marvel as it unfolds, see all the preparations for totalitarian control.
[01:54:30.750 --> 01:54:36.672]  The system intends to use this coming crisis to get more power, as Peter Shipp was talking about earlier.
[01:54:36.672 --> 01:54:39.333]  He joins us right now for this segment.
[01:54:39.333 --> 01:54:40.494]  The next, thanks for holding.
[01:54:40.494 --> 01:54:42.914]  Sherry in Texas, you're on the air.
[01:54:42.914 --> 01:54:43.355]  Go ahead.
[01:54:43.355 --> 01:54:44.035]  Thanks for calling.
[01:54:45.905 --> 01:54:47.105]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:54:47.105 --> 01:54:51.727]  Yeah, I have, on the economy, I have a comment and a question.
[01:54:51.727 --> 01:54:53.468]  Yeah, go ahead, ma'am.
[01:54:53.468 --> 01:55:08.554]  What I'm seeing is like a guy on a buckboard holding back these horses, and so for September, October, and even into November, he pulls up on those reins and he circles the buckboards headed towards his cliff, and he turns it around.
[01:55:09.014 --> 01:55:10.836]  And then he turns it around again.
[01:55:10.836 --> 01:55:16.121]  But come November and past November, he can't pull back anymore.
[01:55:16.121 --> 01:55:22.306]  That thing is going to go down freefall and then break apart and go down again.
[01:55:22.306 --> 01:55:24.969]  Break apart a little on a ledge, go down again.
[01:55:24.969 --> 01:55:26.711]  But I do think it'll come back.
[01:55:26.711 --> 01:55:30.954]  I'm not going to buy any more silver until it goes to single digits.
[01:55:30.954 --> 01:55:34.418]  But that would be, for me, focusing just on my silver.
[01:55:35.498 --> 01:55:38.301]  Okay, listen, I'm going to jump to the next person.
[01:55:38.301 --> 01:55:39.221]  That's an important question.
[01:55:39.221 --> 01:55:39.481]  Go ahead.
[01:55:53.021 --> 01:55:58.726]  Yeah, well, first of all, I mean, it's too hard to know when the situation is going to turn around when you're talking about 2020.
[01:55:58.726 --> 01:56:05.471]  But my advice to the caller, she says she wants to wait for single digits to buy more silver.
[01:56:05.471 --> 01:56:08.134]  Silver hasn't been a single digits in a long time.
[01:56:08.134 --> 01:56:10.416]  It's about 14 and a half dollars an ounce now.
[01:56:11.096 --> 01:56:13.237]  Um, you know, what are you going to do if it goes above 20?
[01:56:13.237 --> 01:56:15.477]  Are you still going to wait for single digits?
[01:56:15.477 --> 01:56:19.378]  You know, I think there's far more upside in the price of silver.
[01:56:19.378 --> 01:56:23.719]  We've come down from 50, which is where we were on the highs a few years ago.
[01:56:23.719 --> 01:56:29.700]  So I think, you know, there's a good chance while you're waiting for it to go down to single digits, it might go above 50.
[01:56:29.700 --> 01:56:32.281]  So I would suggest that the people who are interested in silver
[01:56:33.021 --> 01:56:34.002]  Buy some now.
[01:56:34.002 --> 01:56:38.104]  I mean, if you get lucky enough to buy more in the single digits, well, I guess you can do so.
[01:56:38.104 --> 01:56:50.610]  But I wouldn't hold my breath, and I wouldn't wait for that, because you may be waiting for an indefinite period of time, and you may end up chasing the market and buying much, much higher, and so the money you were trying to save, you might end up losing a lot more.
[01:56:50.610 --> 01:56:51.070]  Sure.
[01:56:51.070 --> 01:56:54.772]  Peter, do you expect more big fireworks in September and October?
[01:56:54.772 --> 01:56:57.193]  Because that's usually when we see the big crashes.
[01:56:57.193 --> 01:57:00.115]  This time, we're seeing them in late summer, early fall.
[01:57:00.115 --> 01:57:00.655]  What's that mean?
[01:57:01.513 --> 01:57:02.994]  No, we're just getting started.
[01:57:02.994 --> 01:57:07.996]  I mean, you know, the market, the technicals are breaking down now here in August.
[01:57:07.996 --> 01:57:13.278]  And I think as we go into September, the technical picture is not bright for the U.S.
[01:57:13.278 --> 01:57:14.258]  stock market.
[01:57:14.258 --> 01:57:24.282]  And I think that the market could continue to fall, especially if people still think that the Fed is going to raise rates, maybe not in September, but maybe October now they're talking about.
[01:57:24.282 --> 01:57:28.844]  And so as long as that threat is dangling out there, that is going to put pressure on the U.S.
[01:57:28.844 --> 01:57:31.105]  stock market, which is already very expensive.
[01:57:31.485 --> 01:57:44.317]  And remember, for a while, people were thinking, hey, it's okay if the Fed raises rates, because the economy will be strong when they're raising rates, and normally when the Fed raises rates, you know, the market goes up for a few years before it goes down.
[01:57:44.317 --> 01:57:47.520]  But that's because the economy normally is strong when the Fed raises rates.
[01:57:47.520 --> 01:57:47.860]  That's right.
[01:57:47.860 --> 01:57:49.462]  Right now, the economy is weakening.
[01:57:49.462 --> 01:57:51.203]  All right, let's jam in one more.
[01:57:51.203 --> 01:57:52.725]  Before we go to break, come back with more.
[01:57:52.725 --> 01:57:54.686]  Peter in Washington, you're on the air with Peter Schiff.
[01:57:54.686 --> 01:57:54.927]  Go ahead.
[01:57:57.587 --> 01:57:58.528]  Hello, Mr. Schiff.
[01:57:58.528 --> 01:57:59.149]  Can you hear me?
[01:57:59.149 --> 01:58:00.170]  Yes, he can hear you.
[01:58:00.170 --> 01:58:00.971]  What's your question?
[01:58:00.971 --> 01:58:01.872]  Okay, okay.
[01:58:01.872 --> 01:58:15.129]  The question I have is, what do you think of Jim Rickards' advice that one temporarily has dollars but buys gold kind of slowly?
[01:58:16.812 --> 01:58:22.356]  Well, you know, I think the dollar has already rallied, you know, as much as it's going to do in general.
[01:58:22.356 --> 01:58:24.598]  I mean, there might be a little bit more.
[01:58:24.598 --> 01:58:31.964]  Jim's advice probably was pretty good if you followed it a couple years ago, but I don't think following it now, and I know I've talked to Jim quite a bit.
[01:58:31.964 --> 01:58:34.646]  He lives not too far from me in Connecticut, and we're pretty much done.
[01:58:34.646 --> 01:58:36.128]  I'll tell you what, we've got to go to break again.
[01:58:36.128 --> 01:58:36.848]  Sorry to cut you off.
[01:58:36.848 --> 01:58:37.369]  Stay there, Peter.
[01:58:37.369 --> 01:58:38.349]  You can finish your question.

[02:00:09.544 --> 02:00:11.165]  You want answers?

[02:00:16.887 --> 02:00:20.989]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:20.989 --> 02:00:23.090]  Alright, Peter's gotta go here in about four or five minutes.
[02:00:23.090 --> 02:00:25.831]  We're gonna try to jam in these calls as quickly as possible.
[02:00:25.831 --> 02:00:28.893]  Peter in Washington, did Peter Schiff answer your question?
[02:00:28.893 --> 02:00:29.953]  He got cut off by the break.
[02:00:29.953 --> 02:00:31.474]  Did you have anything else you wanted to say?
[02:00:31.474 --> 02:00:33.495]  Yeah, he basically answered it.
[02:00:33.495 --> 02:00:33.895]  Thank you.
[02:00:34.420 --> 02:00:36.641]  All right, thank you, sir, for calling.
[02:00:36.641 --> 02:00:39.143]  Sorry, I'm rude, running through people quick, but I waited to go to calls.
[02:00:39.143 --> 02:00:40.163]  I apologize.
[02:00:40.163 --> 02:00:43.445]  Rob in Vancouver, do you have a question for Peter Schiff?
[02:00:43.445 --> 02:00:44.545]  Yeah, hey, Peter.
[02:00:44.545 --> 02:00:46.446]  I've met you a couple times in mining conferences.
[02:00:46.446 --> 02:00:48.988]  What's your thoughts on junior mining?
[02:00:48.988 --> 02:00:53.270]  In $1,000 gold, these guys really don't exist, and you seem like you're a big fan.
[02:00:53.270 --> 02:00:54.250]  Any thoughts?
[02:00:54.250 --> 02:00:55.671]  Will there be a trigger here?
[02:00:55.671 --> 02:00:56.892]  That's a question.
[02:00:56.892 --> 02:00:57.072]  Thanks.
[02:00:58.294 --> 02:01:02.437]  Yeah, well, you know, gold, they have a hard time at $1,140 gold too.
[02:01:02.437 --> 02:01:05.580]  And of course, you know, there's no money to fund exploration.
[02:01:05.580 --> 02:01:09.363]  So those companies have had terrible, terrible problems in the last several years.
[02:01:09.363 --> 02:01:16.408]  I don't know how much worse it's going to get, but I do believe that ultimately it's going to end up being a bonanza for the guys that remain.
[02:01:16.408 --> 02:01:26.096]  And of course, we've invested such a little amount in exploration and development projects over the years that when gold prices take off, it's going to be a long time before the extra supply
[02:01:26.596 --> 02:01:27.117]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:01:56.061 --> 02:02:09.364]  Mr. Schiff, all of your Europec funds are losing double-digit in one-year rate of returns, with your precious metal gold fund losing negative 44.48% according to Bloomberg this morning.
[02:02:09.364 --> 02:02:14.746]  How do you account for this sort of losses that you're being touted as some sort of an accurate expert?
[02:02:14.746 --> 02:02:18.187]  Well, he's had huge profits before, and he says they're riding out a bear market.
[02:02:18.187 --> 02:02:19.467]  I mean, I'm answering his question for him.
[02:02:20.236 --> 02:02:26.540]  Yeah, so the funds that we manage are down along with all of the foreign markets.
[02:02:26.540 --> 02:02:33.345]  I mean, our gold fund is faring about the same, maybe a little bit better than your typical gold fund during this period of time.
[02:02:33.345 --> 02:02:35.846]  I mean, gold stocks have gone down dramatically.
[02:02:35.846 --> 02:02:37.648]  We are not short-term investors.
[02:02:37.648 --> 02:02:39.909]  We're positioning ourselves for the long run.
[02:02:39.909 --> 02:02:43.632]  I'm not trying to be a short-term market timer, nor do I claim to be one.
[02:02:43.632 --> 02:02:46.834]  In fact, you answered his question before we went to him.
[02:02:46.834 --> 02:02:49.876]  You were just talking about that, about this is a long-term deal.
[02:02:50.580 --> 02:02:59.729]  And many of our funds, you know, if you compare them to our benchmarks, we are doing very well relative to the benchmarks that we compete with.
[02:02:59.729 --> 02:03:03.413]  It's just that we are working in a strong dollar environment.
[02:03:03.413 --> 02:03:07.377]  When I invest in foreign markets, I'm investing in foreign currencies.
[02:03:07.377 --> 02:03:10.641]  Look, I have a company in Canada, Europe Pacific Canada.
[02:03:11.101 --> 02:03:23.990]  And those clients are making money on the same stocks that my American clients are losing money in because they're measuring their stocks in Canadian dollars and there they're going up and my American clients are measuring in US dollars where they're going down.
[02:03:23.990 --> 02:03:27.952]  Sure, well where you've really been right is predicting this downturn accurately.
[02:03:27.952 --> 02:03:29.013]  That's the whole point.
[02:03:29.013 --> 02:03:30.154]  Thank you Aaron.
[02:03:30.754 --> 02:03:32.335]  You know, we had a bubble.
[02:03:32.335 --> 02:03:39.020]  My clients were all losing money between 1996 and 2000 during the dot-com bubble and the dollar bubble.
[02:03:39.020 --> 02:03:42.883]  I was positioning myself for the aftermath of that bubble.
[02:03:42.883 --> 02:03:50.048]  The returns that my clients made were from 2001 to 2008, and the returns dwarfed the losses.
[02:03:50.048 --> 02:03:56.172]  And basically, all the stocks that I owned that were going down and the dollar was going up, they all skyrocketed when the dollar went down.
[02:03:56.172 --> 02:03:58.274]  Sure, that's how you generated billions of dollars.
[02:03:58.274 --> 02:03:58.734]  Real quick.
[02:03:59.074 --> 02:03:59.535]  I think so.
[02:04:18.776 --> 02:04:24.379]  Well, you've been proven right before and you're certainly right about what was going to happen, so we'll continue to watch.
[02:04:24.379 --> 02:04:26.240]  Peter Schiff, thank you so much for the time.
[02:04:37.731 --> 02:04:38.932]  Thanks for having me on.
[02:04:38.932 --> 02:04:39.353]  Have a good day.
[02:04:58.703 --> 02:05:01.105]  Kit Daniels, InfoWars.com.
[02:05:01.105 --> 02:05:10.492]  The Financial Times has published an anonymous article which calls for the abolition of cash to give central banks and governments more power, entitled The Case for Retiring Another Barbarous Relic.
[02:05:10.492 --> 02:05:18.038]  The article falsely claims that when people stockpile cash in anticipation for another economic collapse, they're causing distortion to the economic system.
[02:05:18.038 --> 02:05:26.865]  Complaining that cash cannot be tracked and traced, the writer argues that abolition would make life easier for governments set on squeezing the informal economy out of existence.
[02:05:27.205 --> 02:05:34.510]  This will only enslave the public by allowing central banks and the government unparalleled ability to confiscate money whenever they want through taxes and bail-ins.
[02:05:34.510 --> 02:05:35.431]  Think about this.
[02:05:35.431 --> 02:05:38.132]  It will allow them to control you by owning your paycheck.
[02:05:38.132 --> 02:05:41.575]  You know, they'll be able to prevent you from spending money whenever they want.
[02:05:41.575 --> 02:05:45.417]  And when it comes to so-called bail-ins, just look at Cyprus, for example.
[02:05:45.417 --> 02:05:54.383]  In 2013, when Cyprus' largest bank was sunk from exposure to debt-crippled Greece, the Cypriot government looted people's bank accounts as part of the bail-in program.

[02:06:58.523 --> 02:07:02.607]  Alex Jones here with a very important news alert for InfoWars listeners.
[02:07:02.607 --> 02:07:13.075]  We've confirmed through our major suppliers attempting to resupply Survival Shield X2 Deep Earth Crystals that elite corporations are buying up the supplies all over the world.
[02:07:13.075 --> 02:07:15.998]  So prices are going up and it's very hard to secure it.
[02:07:16.118 --> 02:07:25.266]  We have been able to secure a limited supply of the Pure Deep Earth Crystals and have now been able to produce more Survival Shield Nascent Iodine X2.
[02:07:25.266 --> 02:07:26.787]  This is the good halogen.
[02:07:26.787 --> 02:07:29.850]  This is the opposite of the bad halogens like fluoride.

[02:08:12.033 --> 02:08:17.861]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[02:08:17.861 --> 02:08:23.029]  All circuits are dead!
[02:08:26.721 --> 02:08:33.906]  You know, we told you they were going to start delivering huge armored vehicles to local police departments to fight the Tea Party and the gun owners.
[02:08:33.906 --> 02:08:39.410]  Because we had the Army training manuals seven, eight years ago, even before Obama got in.
[02:08:39.410 --> 02:08:41.212]  That was going on in government.
[02:08:41.212 --> 02:08:44.354]  We told you that the number one enemy would be the gun owners, the patriots, the veterans.
[02:08:44.354 --> 02:08:46.115]  That's now in public.
[02:08:46.115 --> 02:08:49.778]  We told you they were going to try to push forced inoculations.
[02:08:49.778 --> 02:08:54.341]  We told you that if you didn't have Obamacare, they'd start taking money out of your bank account or garnishing your wages.
[02:08:54.341 --> 02:08:55.022]  That's now starting.
[02:08:56.274 --> 02:08:57.654]  We told you basically everything.
[02:08:57.654 --> 02:09:05.077]  Remember Matt Drudge two years ago said they're going to start taking money out of your bank account and there's going to be a penalty.
[02:09:05.077 --> 02:09:06.358]  He was just reading out of the bill.
[02:09:06.358 --> 02:09:08.838]  They said Matt Drudge is insane, he's a liar.
[02:09:08.838 --> 02:09:10.739]  No, you're liars!
[02:09:10.739 --> 02:09:13.220]  And that's what I'm sick of is the bald-faced lying.
[02:09:13.220 --> 02:09:14.721]  Ha ha, you're kooks.
[02:09:14.721 --> 02:09:17.822]  You say hydrofluorosilicic acid fluoride isn't good for you.
[02:09:17.822 --> 02:09:18.902]  Everybody knows it's good for you.
[02:09:18.902 --> 02:09:19.802]  Really?
[02:09:19.802 --> 02:09:21.243]  The major medical journals
[02:09:22.281 --> 02:09:31.845]  Like the American Medical Association, American Dental Association, because of lawsuits, the last three years came out and said, okay, under five-year-olds shouldn't brush with fluoride toothpaste.
[02:09:31.845 --> 02:09:35.206]  It causes dental fluorosis and fracturing of the bones in the body.
[02:09:36.658 --> 02:09:41.381]  Now the federal government's come out and said, take the fluoride out of the water, take it out of the pesticide.
[02:09:41.381 --> 02:09:44.102]  We're winning, you're losing.
[02:09:44.102 --> 02:09:49.845]  Yes, Obamacare had penalties that started kicking in on business owners this year.
[02:09:49.845 --> 02:10:00.651]  Next year, they've announced and the IRS hired 7,000, then another 11,000 agents to carry out Obamacare and start garnishing your wages.
[02:10:00.651 --> 02:10:02.773]  Get ready.
[02:10:02.773 --> 02:10:03.213]  Get ready.
[02:10:04.716 --> 02:10:14.642]  And this was mailed to us by a listener, Tim Frasche brought it in to me, it came into the shipping department, into the mail room, um, document cam please, Hillary laughing pin.
[02:10:14.642 --> 02:10:17.243]  Ha ha ha, ha ha ha.
[02:10:17.243 --> 02:10:19.044]  Laugh with at Hillary.
[02:10:19.044 --> 02:10:23.227]  And I love how it's non-partisan, it isn't even attacking her.
[02:10:23.227 --> 02:10:30.251]  Uh, it actually looks like a cross between her and uh, I guess kind of like a Rachel Maddow.
[02:10:30.251 --> 02:10:32.132]  And you press the button and then she laughs.
[02:10:39.107 --> 02:10:41.808]  That's her, when she does that laugh.
[02:10:41.808 --> 02:10:43.489]  I mean, she's so witch-like.
[02:10:43.489 --> 02:10:45.090]  It's not that she's a corrupt globalist.
[02:10:45.090 --> 02:10:53.114]  You guys are going to bring something in?
[02:10:53.114 --> 02:10:54.515]  Man, I tell you, she's creepy.
[02:10:54.515 --> 02:10:58.617]  We don't sell this at infowarestore.com.
[02:10:58.617 --> 02:11:00.598]  But I think we should.
[02:11:00.598 --> 02:11:02.559]  Because it's really important.
[02:11:02.559 --> 02:11:02.939]  Shut up!
[02:11:03.831 --> 02:11:09.155]  It's really important to denigrate these people because they say she's a woman, you can't criticize her.
[02:11:09.155 --> 02:11:11.396]  I'll criticize anybody I want.
[02:11:11.396 --> 02:11:17.180]  The answer to political correctness is to tell them to shut up right back in their face.
[02:11:17.180 --> 02:11:18.201]  You want me to shut up?
[02:11:18.201 --> 02:11:20.743]  You go ahead and keep spouting all your bullets.
[02:11:20.743 --> 02:11:22.144]  It's embarrassing.
[02:11:22.144 --> 02:11:23.605]  We'll say boy and girl.
[02:11:23.605 --> 02:11:25.206]  We'll have separate bathrooms.
[02:11:25.206 --> 02:11:26.547]  We'll have private property.
[02:11:26.547 --> 02:11:28.048]  We're not taking your vaccines.
[02:11:28.048 --> 02:11:29.409]  We're going to label the foods.
[02:11:29.409 --> 02:11:30.610]  We're not going to eat your GMO.
[02:11:32.142 --> 02:11:37.423]  You're all going to go bankrupt because people are going to start voting with their dollars and not be left or right but be common sense.
[02:11:37.423 --> 02:11:50.846]  Did you guys document Cam on her?
[02:11:50.846 --> 02:11:56.988]  It's like a blonde haired Rachel Maddow.
[02:11:56.988 --> 02:11:57.328]  It does.
[02:12:04.363 --> 02:12:05.944]  Can you imagine having her as president?
[02:12:05.944 --> 02:12:08.425]  Let me ask you a question, Anthony Gichardi.
[02:12:08.425 --> 02:12:11.566]  We're going to give the number out, cover news, and take calls.
[02:12:11.566 --> 02:12:19.710]  What do you think is really going on in election 2016 with all the players, the different groups that are involved, Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton?
[02:12:19.710 --> 02:12:20.730]  I think Larry Nichols is right.
[02:12:20.730 --> 02:12:21.811]  He said this about three weeks ago.
[02:12:22.651 --> 02:12:29.537]  And then right after that it came out in the news that the Obamas are getting, when he said it, I kind of rolled my eyes, but really it's true.
[02:12:29.537 --> 02:12:43.669]  They're flushing the toilet on Hillary because they want to be their own new dynasty and stay in control and even run Mrs. Obama, or his beard, run Obama's beard for the Senate or something.
[02:12:43.669 --> 02:12:46.892]  So it's dynasties fighting with each other like Roman emperors.
[02:12:46.892 --> 02:12:47.612]  I kind of love it.
[02:12:47.612 --> 02:12:48.954]  It's that separation of powers.
[02:12:49.474 --> 02:12:54.303]  That's actually keeping us safe because this is an evil dynasty and needs to go down in my view.
[02:12:54.303 --> 02:12:58.370]  I think we're seeing the beginning of the end of Hillary Clinton if we just put the heat to her.
[02:12:59.153 --> 02:13:06.397]  I think just when things get as crazy as possible is when it really comes to fruition, and it's super dynastic.
[02:13:06.397 --> 02:13:08.278]  I mean, just listen to that laugh.
[02:13:08.278 --> 02:13:10.800]  But imagine this for a minute for dynastic.
[02:13:10.800 --> 02:13:23.587]  Imagine Hillary Clinton runs and tries to get Bill as her VP, and then Jeb tries to get George as his VP, and then Biden does something like gets Michelle Obama as his VP.
[02:13:24.893 --> 02:13:26.694]  Or he could get Jenner as his VP.
[02:13:26.694 --> 02:13:27.994]  He could get Jenner.
[02:13:27.994 --> 02:13:30.495]  I think Jenner would win by a landslide.
[02:13:30.495 --> 02:13:34.196]  I would rather have Caitlyn Jenner as our president than Hillary Clinton.
[02:13:34.196 --> 02:13:35.516]  I would too.
[02:13:35.516 --> 02:13:36.117]  Easy.
[02:13:36.117 --> 02:13:40.778]  Let's draft Caitlyn Jenner and then we can get Bradley Manning out.
[02:13:40.778 --> 02:13:41.398]  He has a new name.
[02:13:41.398 --> 02:13:41.718]  What is it?
[02:13:41.718 --> 02:13:42.539]  Buffy Manning?
[02:13:42.539 --> 02:13:46.660]  I think it's Chelsea Manning.
[02:13:46.660 --> 02:13:47.520]  I'm serious.
[02:13:47.520 --> 02:13:49.381]  I think we should have both of them run.
[02:13:49.381 --> 02:13:50.521]  Jenner 2016.
[02:13:50.521 --> 02:13:51.621]  Hashtag Jenner 2016.
[02:13:51.621 --> 02:13:52.902]  I'm on it right now.
[02:13:54.269 --> 02:13:55.489]  I'm all over it.
[02:13:55.489 --> 02:13:56.810]  It'd be Jenner Manning.
[02:13:56.810 --> 02:13:58.170]  Jenner Manning.
[02:13:58.170 --> 02:14:00.971]  But man is kind of sexist.
[02:14:00.971 --> 02:14:05.313]  So, Jenner Pink Penguin.
[02:14:05.313 --> 02:14:06.934]  Hashtag Jenner Pink Penguin 2016.
[02:14:08.649 --> 02:14:09.249]  That's it.
[02:14:09.249 --> 02:14:10.530]  The winning bid is in, guys.
[02:14:10.530 --> 02:14:11.590]  Purple Penguin, I'm sorry.
[02:14:11.590 --> 02:14:12.571]  I need to go home.
[02:14:12.571 --> 02:14:14.872]  I didn't say the right political correct cult word today.
[02:14:14.872 --> 02:14:17.153]  I need to... Can you believe how cultic it's getting?
[02:14:17.153 --> 02:14:21.295]  How bizarre when there's the biggest gay lesbian group in the country that says ban boy and girl?
[02:14:21.295 --> 02:14:23.776]  I mean, this is just fruit level.
[02:14:23.776 --> 02:14:28.058]  Like, they're God now and they go, you will no longer say boy or girl.
[02:14:28.058 --> 02:14:30.919]  You will no longer have boy and girl's bathrooms.
[02:14:30.919 --> 02:14:33.440]  I mean, it's just like, who are you people?
[02:14:33.440 --> 02:14:34.481]  Bunch of cult leaders.
[02:14:34.741 --> 02:14:36.582]  Well, they say we're unaccepting.
[02:14:36.582 --> 02:14:37.523]  I'm pretty accepting.
[02:14:37.523 --> 02:14:38.883]  I really don't care what they do.
[02:14:38.883 --> 02:14:39.524]  At all.
[02:14:39.524 --> 02:14:43.726]  It's them not accepting anything else besides their limited scope of what they want.
[02:14:43.726 --> 02:14:45.847]  Yeah, they are the intolerant control freaks.
[02:14:45.847 --> 02:14:51.170]  Yeah, let's just listen to that.
[02:14:51.170 --> 02:14:51.931]  They are crazy.
[02:14:51.931 --> 02:14:58.975]  It's like, we're gonna tell them we're banning husband and wife, father and mother, boy and girl.
[02:14:58.975 --> 02:15:02.097]  And they'll do what we say!
[02:15:02.097 --> 02:15:03.037]  We're liberal!
[02:15:03.037 --> 02:15:03.978]  We rule everything!
[02:15:07.244 --> 02:15:09.846]  Yeah, I'm gonna start laughing like I'm pretty sick.
[02:15:09.846 --> 02:15:14.450]  What difference does it make?
[02:15:14.450 --> 02:15:15.191]  I like it.
[02:15:15.191 --> 02:15:17.733]  And you notice, we're sitting here, we don't care about any of it.
[02:15:17.733 --> 02:15:20.475]  We don't care if someone wants to be transsexual, any of it.
[02:15:20.475 --> 02:15:21.956]  We don't care if you attack us.
[02:15:21.956 --> 02:15:22.597]  We don't care.
[02:15:22.597 --> 02:15:24.979]  We're our own people, you scum.
[02:15:24.979 --> 02:15:29.843]  We don't want some joker-faced murdering criminal witch running around getting our guns.
[02:15:29.843 --> 02:15:30.683]  Got it?
[02:15:30.683 --> 02:15:31.884]  Who's got a bunch of bodyguards.
[02:15:31.884 --> 02:15:34.987]  I mean, they have no argument to take our guns.
[02:15:34.987 --> 02:15:36.028]  They are a joke.
[02:15:38.260 --> 02:15:40.562]  It's time to start calling them all of them like Piers Morgan.
[02:15:40.562 --> 02:15:41.623]  You're a joke!
[02:15:41.623 --> 02:15:43.864]  You're a fraud!
[02:15:43.864 --> 02:15:45.245]  You are a scam artist!
[02:15:45.245 --> 02:15:46.767]  You're a foreign red coat!
[02:15:46.767 --> 02:15:49.589]  Here to get our guns, go to Hades!
[02:15:49.589 --> 02:15:52.911]  And then it's something like Matthew McConaughey comes out and says, yeah, I kind of like guns.
[02:15:52.911 --> 02:15:54.192]  I don't think they're that bad of a thing.
[02:15:54.192 --> 02:15:55.073]  It's like, oh my!
[02:15:55.073 --> 02:15:57.455]  Major backlash against him and his Buick sponsorship.
[02:15:57.455 --> 02:15:59.296]  And he's like, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
[02:15:59.296 --> 02:15:59.556]  Yeah.
[02:15:59.556 --> 02:16:05.121]  I mean, you don't have any... Now it's rumored that Matthew McConaughey will not have his testicles removed.
[02:16:05.121 --> 02:16:06.702]  This is racist and sexist.
[02:16:08.035 --> 02:16:09.776]  Q Hillary laugh.
[02:16:09.776 --> 02:16:17.500]  There's so many celebrities and politicians that are against all this, but they can't speak out because of that right there.
[02:16:17.500 --> 02:16:19.221]  Sorry.
[02:16:19.221 --> 02:16:20.782]  That kind of gets annoying.
[02:16:20.782 --> 02:16:21.962]  Well, it was annoying the first time.
[02:16:21.962 --> 02:16:23.563]  Now I like it.
[02:16:23.563 --> 02:16:24.484]  Now I'm addicted to it.
[02:16:25.629 --> 02:16:26.749]  I got like sleep next to it.
[02:16:26.749 --> 02:16:28.230]  It's your alarm clock.
[02:16:28.230 --> 02:16:32.210]  Well, no, I should be able to marry this Hillary laughing pin.
[02:16:32.210 --> 02:16:32.671]  You should.
[02:16:32.671 --> 02:16:34.071]  No, but you're right.
[02:16:34.071 --> 02:16:36.371]  And if no one else marries it, they're bad.
[02:16:36.371 --> 02:16:38.592]  It's not just... They have to be accepting.
[02:16:38.592 --> 02:16:45.593]  Now we have to ban any other form of marriage but marrying a Hillary laughing pin because any other type of marriage hurts me, like the name boy or girl.
[02:16:45.593 --> 02:16:47.594]  That would be bigotry if other people don't marry you.
[02:16:47.594 --> 02:16:50.395]  Because if you say boys and girls, that hurts people that are purple penguins.
[02:16:50.395 --> 02:16:51.115]  Yeah, that's bad.
[02:16:51.115 --> 02:16:52.375]  Biologically, that's not allowed.
[02:16:52.415 --> 02:16:54.416]  Well now you hear they're banning all flags in school.
[02:16:54.416 --> 02:16:55.597]  They should.
[02:16:55.597 --> 02:16:56.258]  Ban everything!
[02:16:56.258 --> 02:16:57.438]  They should ban schools.
[02:16:57.438 --> 02:16:58.419]  Blow the planet up!
[02:16:58.419 --> 02:16:59.800]  Then there'll be no more racism.
[02:16:59.800 --> 02:17:01.401]  That's the only way to solve it.
[02:17:01.401 --> 02:17:03.863]  I think they should ban the word racism, actually.
[02:17:03.863 --> 02:17:05.163]  Ban everything.
[02:17:05.163 --> 02:17:07.025]  Ban the word ban.
[02:17:07.025 --> 02:17:11.968]  We could all marry our Hillary Clinton dolls and just listen to her beautiful voice for the rest of our lives.
[02:17:11.968 --> 02:17:13.509]  That's actually an idea.
[02:17:13.509 --> 02:17:15.150]  It's a utopia of sorts, isn't it?
[02:17:15.150 --> 02:17:17.712]  I wonder if Rachel Maddow has a Hillary blow-up doll.
[02:17:18.838 --> 02:17:20.703]  I can only imagine.
[02:17:20.703 --> 02:17:22.749]  We should ask her.
[02:17:22.749 --> 02:17:25.759]  When Caitlyn Jenner is president, that'll be the first question that she asks.
[02:17:28.405 --> 02:17:31.066]  I'm sorry, I'm not trying to be morning shock jock here.
[02:17:31.066 --> 02:17:34.068]  I'm just sick of these cultural tyrants.
[02:17:34.068 --> 02:17:52.176]  These people are unbelievably ridiculous and pompous and over-the-top lecturing everyone, and all these cultureless people brought up on TV are just supposed to accept whatever the new monthly flavor of political correctness is, and I just reject all of you.
[02:17:52.176 --> 02:17:54.477]  Do you people realize what jokes you are?
[02:17:54.477 --> 02:17:56.077]  I mean, you are...
[02:17:58.632 --> 02:17:59.573]  No one's buying it.
[02:17:59.573 --> 02:18:00.655]  People like this kind of stuff.
[02:18:00.655 --> 02:18:05.442]  That's why people are so dying to hear Donald Trump, because he's not going to be completely politically correct.
[02:18:05.442 --> 02:18:06.524]  People love this kind of stuff.
[02:18:06.524 --> 02:18:07.726]  This is what people want to hear.
[02:18:07.726 --> 02:18:12.874]  Donald Trump is arrogant enough that he may just be for real, wants to be president, and now even mainline people are saying, okay, he may be president.
[02:18:13.422 --> 02:18:13.802]  Yeah.
[02:18:13.802 --> 02:18:16.783]  Others are thinking about, oh he won't get the vote, oh he's not popular.
[02:18:16.783 --> 02:18:18.684]  Now there's all these Hispanic groups that like him.
[02:18:18.684 --> 02:18:19.885]  It's just common sense.
[02:18:19.885 --> 02:18:21.845]  Hey, I can't come there and get stuff for free.
[02:18:21.845 --> 02:18:22.746]  You can't come here.
[02:18:22.746 --> 02:18:23.686]  You're hardworking.
[02:18:23.686 --> 02:18:25.747]  We'll make the process really easy.
[02:18:25.747 --> 02:18:28.508]  If you don't have a criminal record and you, you know, have something to offer.
[02:18:28.968 --> 02:18:30.589]  Seems like Hispanics love him, actually.
[02:18:30.589 --> 02:18:33.051]  Pretty much everyone I talk to loves Donald Trump.
[02:18:33.051 --> 02:18:34.853]  They try to push him on me.
[02:18:34.853 --> 02:18:36.494]  Like, hey, we hate illegal immigrants.
[02:18:36.494 --> 02:18:38.656]  They're ruining everything for us, and it's true.
[02:18:38.656 --> 02:18:39.736]  It's all just common sense.
[02:18:39.736 --> 02:18:40.877]  None of this is fanatical.
[02:18:40.877 --> 02:18:41.838]  None of this is crazy.
[02:18:41.838 --> 02:18:43.679]  It's all just reality, and we're sitting here.
[02:18:43.679 --> 02:18:46.081]  Then the media pretends that no one supports it.
[02:18:46.081 --> 02:18:48.923]  Take a North African town.
[02:18:48.923 --> 02:18:55.769]  Do you think a North African town of 1,000 people, if 2,000 Germans show up homeless with no money and say, take care of me, what would the North Africans do?
[02:18:57.486 --> 02:18:59.388]  They would not lovingly take care of them.
[02:18:59.388 --> 02:19:06.097]  But the Germans, it's like, take 500, take 1,000, take 2,000, and they're just like, now it's, take them in your house.
[02:19:06.097 --> 02:19:07.479]  And it's like, no!
[02:19:07.479 --> 02:19:08.940]  You're a racist, you're a racist!
[02:19:08.940 --> 02:19:12.325]  I mean, you know, at a certain point, that will make people go Hitler.
[02:19:14.161 --> 02:19:16.823]  Which is part of this larger plan, Anthony.
[02:19:16.823 --> 02:19:17.823]  I broke this down earlier.
[02:19:17.823 --> 02:19:23.367]  We're going to open the phones up 800-259-9231 on other issues now.
[02:19:23.367 --> 02:19:26.388]  We shut down the other calls because it was on economic issues.
[02:19:26.388 --> 02:19:27.629]  I apologize, but it had to be done.
[02:19:27.629 --> 02:19:29.030]  That's Standard Talk Radio.
[02:19:29.030 --> 02:19:30.431]  We're trying to start just applying that.
[02:19:30.911 --> 02:19:33.512]  So that it's not for an old guest, it's for the new topics.
[02:19:33.512 --> 02:19:34.293]  But 800-259-9231.
[02:19:34.293 --> 02:19:40.215]  When you come back, Hillary Clinton compares pro-livers to terrorists.
[02:19:40.215 --> 02:19:43.697]  This is how extreme the rhetoric is getting and how desperate they are.
[02:19:43.697 --> 02:19:48.900]  No, Hillary, you're the one at the State Department shipping Stinger missiles to Al-Qaeda and ISIS.
[02:19:48.900 --> 02:19:52.001]  I think that makes you witch the terrorist.
[02:19:52.001 --> 02:19:54.302]  And you're not laughing now, are you?
[02:19:54.302 --> 02:19:56.103]  Everything isn't funny now, is it?
[02:19:59.013 --> 02:20:02.615]  Okay, honey, I have to ask, and be honest here.
[02:20:02.615 --> 02:20:04.656]  Have you been taking a little blue pill?
[02:20:04.656 --> 02:20:07.678]  Because things have been pretty good in the bedroom lately.
[02:20:07.678 --> 02:20:09.519]  No, I swear.
[02:20:09.519 --> 02:20:13.361]  You didn't pick anything up at the pharmacy last month in Cancun?
[02:20:13.361 --> 02:20:14.101]  No.
[02:20:14.101 --> 02:20:15.902]  Well, something's different.
[02:20:15.902 --> 02:20:18.884]  I have been taking that heart and body extract you bought me.
[02:20:18.884 --> 02:20:21.285]  But that's for your heart and to control your cholesterol.
[02:20:21.285 --> 02:20:24.467]  Well, I read HB extract also promotes healthy prostate function.
[02:20:24.767 --> 02:20:28.568]  I never guessed it would work this well, but... But, you're glad it did.

[02:21:58.675 --> 02:22:11.543]  Atmospheric Aluminum, Mercury Exposure, Estrogen Toxins from Plastics, Microwaves from Cell Phones and Smart Meters, and Low Quality Foods, all combined to create conditions for the very high incidence of disease in our society.
[02:22:11.543 --> 02:22:20.068]  Now more than ever, we all need to be consuming those foods and herbs that epigenetically signal the cells of our body to produce energy, create proteins, and detoxify.

[02:23:50.823 --> 02:23:51.604]  He's going the distance.
[02:23:51.604 --> 02:23:52.504]  He's going for speed.
[02:24:08.720 --> 02:24:19.163]  By the way, Nico, one of our producers, the head producer on the radio side, came in here and said, I know you have Anthony in here, why is he here?
[02:24:19.163 --> 02:24:22.844]  Because they don't really run the show, but they help me when I get off the rails a little bit.
[02:24:22.844 --> 02:24:26.764]  And that's probably a good idea to explain why you're here, why I asked you to come in today.
[02:24:26.764 --> 02:24:27.745]  DrudgeReport.com
[02:24:29.585 --> 02:24:30.025]  We're good to go.
[02:24:52.571 --> 02:24:56.435]  We'll talk about this report when we come back in the next segment.
[02:24:56.435 --> 02:25:03.703]  But since I was mentioning Hillary Clinton, that is why Anthony's here with some other consumer news and interesting things that have to be covered.
[02:25:03.703 --> 02:25:07.447]  But before we get there, let's cover Hillary Clinton right now since we were talking about her.
[02:25:07.447 --> 02:25:14.194]  That's why I had the pin out and I forgot to actually get to the reason I had the pin out because I got so enamored by her siren song.
[02:25:14.194 --> 02:25:14.914]  She's so beautiful.
[02:25:16.141 --> 02:25:19.242]  Clinton compares pro-lifers to terrorists.
[02:25:19.242 --> 02:25:21.543]  They are dead wrong for 21st century America.
[02:25:21.543 --> 02:25:22.863]  We're going forward.
[02:25:22.863 --> 02:25:33.206]  And I guess that means with harvesting babies and... Okay, Hillary, but you might as well pay the women a few hundred thousand dollars for the baby parts, because that's what some of these clinics are getting for late-term abortions.
[02:25:34.403 --> 02:25:42.748]  So we understand you're a ghoulish promoter and a representative of a organ harvesting factory farm system.
[02:25:42.748 --> 02:25:46.790]  So if you're upset about chickens, can we be a little upset about the humans?
[02:25:46.790 --> 02:25:51.172]  Oh, but there's no empathy for humans from PETA because they're Peter Singer run.
[02:25:51.172 --> 02:25:53.794]  It's an anti-human, exterminist worldview.
[02:25:54.454 --> 02:25:59.436]  To take our human empathy and project it onto bunny rabbits, but not onto humans.
[02:25:59.436 --> 02:26:03.857]  How about we treat animals well and humans well as well, you witch?
[02:26:03.857 --> 02:26:07.238]  But you see us as cattle, don't you?
[02:26:07.238 --> 02:26:09.399]  So let's go to this clip.
[02:26:09.399 --> 02:26:10.899]  Extreme views about women?
[02:26:10.899 --> 02:26:15.961]  We expect that from some of the terrorist groups.
[02:26:15.961 --> 02:26:19.982]  We expect that from people who don't want to live in the modern world.
[02:26:21.411 --> 02:26:34.077]  But it's a little hard to take comments from Republicans who want to be the President of the United States, yet they espouse out-of-date and out-of-touch policies.
[02:26:34.077 --> 02:26:38.279]  They are dead wrong for 21st century America!
[02:26:38.279 --> 02:26:42.141]  We're going forward, we're not going back!
[02:26:42.141 --> 02:26:42.962]  She's the future.
[02:26:44.201 --> 02:26:45.081]  Everybody else is the past.
[02:26:45.081 --> 02:26:46.822]  No, Eddie, you're the past.
[02:26:46.822 --> 02:26:49.883]  They ran with Confederate flags for governor every time.
[02:26:49.883 --> 02:26:51.464]  Now she wants them banned.
[02:26:51.464 --> 02:26:54.765]  These people are nothing but psychopath manipulators.
[02:26:54.765 --> 02:26:56.105]  I mean, it's so obvious.
[02:26:56.105 --> 02:26:58.526]  She is a monster.
[02:26:58.526 --> 02:27:01.788]  She is an absolute gangster.
[02:27:01.788 --> 02:27:04.749]  And she wants to play women off against men.
[02:27:04.749 --> 02:27:08.330]  I mean, she is funding Al Qaeda, now known as ISIS.
[02:27:08.330 --> 02:27:09.611]  She ran that operation.
[02:27:09.611 --> 02:27:10.431]  We broke that.
[02:27:10.431 --> 02:27:11.451]  That's now admitted.
[02:27:11.451 --> 02:27:13.112]  Anthony, pop it anytime I'm here ranting.
[02:27:13.877 --> 02:27:15.399]  Although I do kind of like he's just sitting over there.
[02:27:15.399 --> 02:27:18.764]  He's actually an animatronic mannequin.
[02:27:18.764 --> 02:27:19.585]  This is not real.
[02:27:19.585 --> 02:27:20.446]  It's actually not real.
[02:27:20.446 --> 02:27:24.691]  I'm one of those Chuck E. Cheese type robots that can just sit here and kind of listen and nod and agree.
[02:27:24.691 --> 02:27:26.213]  And I also do have a purpose.
[02:27:26.213 --> 02:27:27.876]  As you said earlier, I do have a purpose.
[02:27:27.876 --> 02:27:29.558]  We are going to talk about health news and stuff too.
[02:27:29.738 --> 02:27:32.320]  We are going to do that in the next segment, but right now, another clip.
[02:27:32.320 --> 02:27:38.225]  This is a black transgendered Lives Matter group chanting Hillary for prison.
[02:27:38.225 --> 02:27:41.208]  So see, I'm getting on the Jenner ticket here.
[02:27:41.208 --> 02:27:42.649]  Absolutely.
[02:27:42.649 --> 02:27:43.610]  Let's go and go to that clip.
[02:27:52.757 --> 02:27:54.217]  Even the Democrats are chanting it.
[02:27:54.217 --> 02:28:00.219]  By the way, I saw a bumper sticker six months ago, Hillary Clinton for prison, and I forgot to tell them to make it.
[02:28:00.219 --> 02:28:03.860]  Then I said on air a few weeks ago, I want a Hillary Clinton for prison InfoWars shirt.
[02:28:03.860 --> 02:28:04.580]  I mean, I don't care.
[02:28:04.580 --> 02:28:05.980]  I just want to produce them.
[02:28:05.980 --> 02:28:09.061]  I want to have a limited run of Hillary Clinton for prison t-shirts.
[02:28:09.061 --> 02:28:10.481]  I know folks are already selling them.
[02:28:10.481 --> 02:28:12.282]  Can we turn that around and get that done in the next week?
[02:28:12.862 --> 02:28:20.870]  Okay, we're going to come back, get into this health news, then take your calls on the Cashless Society, Donald Trump, Black Lives Matter, Donald Trump.
[02:28:20.870 --> 02:28:30.700]  I just opened the phones up, people can call on whatever they want, here in this free-for-all Friday afternoon, and they're just calling in on Donald Trump, Donald Trump, Donald Trump.
[02:28:30.700 --> 02:28:36.265]  You know, I love how he didn't apologize to the Univision guy, Ramos, who does all these stunts.
[02:28:37.091 --> 02:28:37.672]  I think so.
[02:28:58.353 --> 02:28:59.174]  Yes, this is the truth.
[02:29:23.877 --> 02:29:25.819]  I should not have been giving this.
[02:29:25.819 --> 02:29:27.740]  Take it out of the studio.
[02:29:27.740 --> 02:29:28.501]  Take it away.
[02:29:28.501 --> 02:29:30.102]  It made me start acting silly.
[02:29:30.102 --> 02:29:32.484]  It's Tim Pruge's fault.
[02:29:32.484 --> 02:29:33.885]  He comes up and gives it to me.
[02:29:33.885 --> 02:29:35.626]  It was a gift by a listener.
[02:29:35.626 --> 02:29:36.487]  Now look what you've done.
[02:29:36.487 --> 02:29:37.708]  I'm giving.
[02:29:37.708 --> 02:29:40.590]  The truth is, I worship Hillary Clinton.
[02:29:40.590 --> 02:29:42.872]  I love her.
[02:29:42.872 --> 02:29:45.073]  And Rachel Maddow.
[02:29:45.073 --> 02:29:46.434]  I admit it, I'm gay.
[02:29:48.035 --> 02:29:51.043]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:51.043 --> 02:29:54.653]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:58.857 --> 02:30:01.178]  Do you know what it means to be an American?
[02:30:01.178 --> 02:30:02.659]  It's more than a flag.
[02:30:02.659 --> 02:30:05.521]  It's more than knowing the star-spangled banner.
[02:30:05.521 --> 02:30:07.122]  It's knowing the Constitution.
[02:30:07.122 --> 02:30:10.204]  It's understanding those rights and fighting for them.
[02:30:10.204 --> 02:30:17.028]  Our country is falling apart because people have forgotten to fight, to stand up in the face of tyranny and do the right thing.
[02:30:17.028 --> 02:30:19.490]  It's putting your life on the line to protect your country.
[02:30:19.650 --> 02:30:22.152]  from enemies both foreign and domestic.
[02:30:22.152 --> 02:30:30.337]  The Bill of Rights is what the people are entitled to against every government, and no government should refuse or rest on inference.
[02:30:30.337 --> 02:30:35.341]  So the Tree of Liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants.
[02:30:36.161 --> 02:30:41.084]  I'm Joe Biggs with Infowars.com, and I believe our flag is more than cloth and ink.
[02:30:41.084 --> 02:30:44.166]  It is a symbol that stands for liberty and freedom.
[02:30:44.166 --> 02:30:49.290]  It is a history of our nation, and it's marked by the blood of those who died defending it.
[02:30:49.290 --> 02:30:51.031]  So join me in this Infowar.
[02:30:51.031 --> 02:30:55.494]  Turn off your TV, put your Cheetos down, get off your butt and join the resistance.
[02:30:59.020 --> 02:31:05.122]  Used since before the days of the Roman Empire to support the body's natural systems and enhance overall health.

[02:33:10.900 --> 02:33:18.564]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:18.564 --> 02:33:31.270]  By the way, we actually had this song, Breaking the Law, cut to Obama and Hillary breaking the law as one of our intros.
[02:33:31.270 --> 02:33:31.550]  So,
[02:33:32.833 --> 02:33:36.417]  We might as well play that as the intro to the final segment coming up.
[02:33:36.417 --> 02:33:38.839]  But for just a second, crank it up!
[02:33:38.839 --> 02:33:44.945]  It's Congress' theme song!
[02:33:44.945 --> 02:33:54.535]  Well, the Texas Attorney General is pled not guilty to fraud for telling two people at dinner they ought to invest in something when he was investing in the company himself.
[02:33:56.556 --> 02:34:00.319]  This is what they indict you for if you're a conservative that actually fights Obama.
[02:34:00.319 --> 02:34:10.667]  Meanwhile, Hillary just openly takes billions of dollars from foreign countries and dictators to then lift bans on weapons to their corrupt nations.
[02:34:10.667 --> 02:34:12.468]  Open and shut criminal activity.
[02:34:12.468 --> 02:34:19.154]  And the reason I'm on a Hillary jag here is that she's been caught red-handed committing a bunch of crimes.
[02:34:20.510 --> 02:34:21.991]  And she needs to go to prison.
[02:34:21.991 --> 02:34:23.432]  She needs to get in trouble.
[02:34:23.432 --> 02:34:27.975]  These are the people that are persecuting libertarians and conservatives all over the U.S.
[02:34:27.975 --> 02:34:31.257]  The Republicans don't do this type of political prosecution.
[02:34:31.257 --> 02:34:32.878]  I've been doing this 20 years.
[02:34:32.878 --> 02:34:37.361]  Nixon did a little bit of it, and they put him out of office.
[02:34:37.361 --> 02:34:40.222]  And people went to jail, like his vice president.
[02:34:40.222 --> 02:34:41.243]  And good, good!
[02:34:41.243 --> 02:34:42.304]  Send him to jail!
[02:34:42.304 --> 02:34:42.524]  I mean...
[02:34:44.525 --> 02:34:45.785]  Oh, it makes me sick.
[02:34:45.785 --> 02:34:48.646]  And for funding Al-Qaeda, send them to jail.
[02:34:48.646 --> 02:34:49.706]  Send Hillary to jail.
[02:34:49.706 --> 02:34:55.288]  And by the way, the Bushes clearly worked with the Bin Ladens at the Carlisle Group.
[02:34:55.288 --> 02:34:57.268]  They clearly were involved with Saudi Arabia.
[02:34:57.268 --> 02:34:58.209]  They were involved in all this.
[02:34:58.209 --> 02:34:59.789]  Send them to jail, too.
[02:34:59.789 --> 02:35:07.071]  I mean, it's time to empty out the prisons of political prisoners and put these political people in jail.
[02:35:07.071 --> 02:35:09.111]  And believe me, the corruption will stop real fast then.
[02:35:09.111 --> 02:35:11.392]  I mean, I've had enough of it.
[02:35:12.332 --> 02:35:18.474]  Now I want to go to Cash, and Andrew, and Jason, and Steve, and Adam, and others that are patiently holding.
[02:35:18.474 --> 02:35:29.618]  Anthony Gucciardi is here in studio with us, but when you've got the Black Lives Matter groups saying Hillary for President, it shows that they're not fully controlled by the Democrats.
[02:35:29.618 --> 02:35:38.121]  The Democrats created Occupy Wall Street, but when they couldn't control it anymore and it got out of their hands, they then had the Feds, remember SWAT team it and shut it down?
[02:35:38.121 --> 02:35:38.801]  That was Obama!
[02:35:40.327 --> 02:35:42.348]  And it's the same thing here.
[02:35:42.348 --> 02:35:46.670]  Black Lives Matter is getting off the plantation, getting off the reservation here.
[02:35:46.670 --> 02:35:49.852]  In your gut, Anthony Gucciardi, where do you see all this politically going?
[02:35:49.852 --> 02:35:52.454]  Because the awakening that's happening is undoubted.
[02:35:52.454 --> 02:36:01.859]  You know, I started screwing around, joking around earlier, because by the third hour, sometimes on a Friday, this is the third hour I kind of get a little bit goofy, because it's depressing covering some of this negative stuff.
[02:36:01.859 --> 02:36:09.563]  But it's overall positive, because knowing this stuff's going on will bring sunshine to the situation.
[02:36:10.685 --> 02:36:15.430]  I think we're seeing a lot of victories across a number of spectrums in a really tangible way.
[02:36:15.430 --> 02:36:18.614]  Now, those Black Lives Matter girls, you said they were also transgender too?
[02:36:18.614 --> 02:36:19.775]  I think that's awesome.
[02:36:19.775 --> 02:36:20.436]  That's great.
[02:36:20.436 --> 02:36:21.577]  Let them go up against Clinton.
[02:36:21.577 --> 02:36:28.104]  That's the best thing because once you go up against them with this fake political correctness system, it's like, well, what are they going to say?
[02:36:28.104 --> 02:36:29.265]  It turns on itself.
[02:36:29.265 --> 02:36:29.866]  Exactly.
[02:36:30.086 --> 02:36:30.906]  I think it's great.
[02:36:30.906 --> 02:36:35.908]  All these black transgender people are awesome if they're going to go against evil things like Hillary Clinton.
[02:36:35.908 --> 02:36:36.768]  That's awesome.
[02:36:36.768 --> 02:36:39.489]  In the food realm, we are seeing... What if purple penguins do it?
[02:36:39.489 --> 02:36:39.989]  That's great.
[02:36:39.989 --> 02:36:41.090]  I love them too.
[02:36:41.090 --> 02:36:47.352]  We're seeing tangible, real results because, as we're going to talk about... Yeah, I wanted them to print that off.
[02:36:47.352 --> 02:36:50.553]  Did they print off the tweets that Tyson's tweeting back at us?
[02:36:52.213 --> 02:36:53.454]  Okay, they're running it in right now.
[02:36:53.454 --> 02:36:53.814]  Thank you.
[02:36:53.814 --> 02:36:54.775]  Yeah, I would like to see those.
[02:36:54.775 --> 02:36:56.036]  Let's talk about that first.
[02:36:56.036 --> 02:36:58.658]  Get into your McDonald's story, and then into all the other news.
[02:36:58.658 --> 02:36:59.179]  Go ahead.
[02:36:59.179 --> 02:36:59.379]  Sure.
[02:36:59.379 --> 02:37:07.406]  So I saw this yesterday, and the headline on InfoWars is, Video McDonald's Chicken Supplier Caught Stabbing Chickens With Spikes.
[02:37:07.406 --> 02:37:09.748]  Graphic Farm Abuse Uncovered.
[02:37:09.748 --> 02:37:12.670]  And when I saw this, it was really, really weird.
[02:37:12.670 --> 02:37:16.774]  And I couldn't believe it at first, because I read a different article title that was about how they
[02:37:17.054 --> 02:37:19.936]  Broke their necks by stomping on their heads and stabbed them with spikes.
[02:37:19.936 --> 02:37:21.777]  I'm thinking why would they even do this?
[02:37:21.777 --> 02:37:22.818]  Here's Fox Business.
[02:37:47.294 --> 02:37:48.436]  I don't want to see this.
[02:37:48.436 --> 02:37:48.876]  Turn it off.
[02:38:05.573 --> 02:38:09.975]  And McDonald's is losing American customers because people just aren't eating their crap anymore.
[02:38:09.975 --> 02:38:11.515]  And I remember, I think it was a year ago.
[02:38:11.515 --> 02:38:12.735]  That shows voting with our dollars.
[02:38:12.735 --> 02:38:14.856]  This is something liberals have done that's good.
[02:38:14.856 --> 02:38:15.316]  Yeah.
[02:38:15.316 --> 02:38:26.240]  The foodies demanding high quality food, demanding tasty food, all the industrial crap stuff is totally going out of style and I have to hand it to the actual liberal trendies
[02:38:27.140 --> 02:38:29.841]  They have actually done a really good job.
[02:38:29.841 --> 02:38:36.923]  Culturally, they're one of the main groups that have actually brought us higher quality food, anti-GMO, stuff like that.
[02:38:36.923 --> 02:38:38.804]  And so I can hand it to them on that front.
[02:38:38.804 --> 02:38:40.244]  I think it's a humanity issue.
[02:38:40.244 --> 02:38:45.486]  None of us want to eat junk in our food, want to eat Roundup in our food, glyphosate-based junk.
[02:38:45.486 --> 02:38:47.286]  But here's Tyson Foo's response to you.
[02:38:47.286 --> 02:38:49.047]  By the way, who launched the Clintons?
[02:38:49.047 --> 02:38:49.387]  Tyson?
[02:38:49.927 --> 02:38:50.828]  I just wanted to add that.
[02:38:50.828 --> 02:38:51.629]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:38:51.629 --> 02:38:53.151]  Well, here's their loving response to you.
[02:38:53.151 --> 02:38:56.875]  It says, at Real Alex Jones, we do not tolerate animal treatment shown in the video.
[02:38:56.875 --> 02:38:58.917]  We're terminating our contract with this farm.
[02:38:58.917 --> 02:39:01.180]  So they've been directly responding to you.
[02:39:01.180 --> 02:39:03.603]  Well, I want to say good job Tyson Foods.
[02:39:03.603 --> 02:39:08.768]  We just simply showed it because there are more humane ways to kill the chickens that are more industrial.
[02:39:09.449 --> 02:39:16.213]  Yeah, I mean, not to mention you don't want to eat chicken that's sitting in its own feces and given antibiotics in the hopes that it'll survive one day longer so it can be killed.
[02:39:16.213 --> 02:39:23.616]  And it was InfoWars and the Food Babe launching the initiative to get them to start phasing out antibiotics chicken that they announced within two years it'll be totally phased out.
[02:39:23.616 --> 02:39:25.858]  That's good, then people might actually eat your food.
[02:39:25.858 --> 02:39:30.660]  If McDonald's didn't make me feel bad and feel sick when I ate it, I would go there.
[02:39:30.660 --> 02:39:33.622]  Because sometimes I'm in the middle of nowhere, that's all there is is a McDonald's.
[02:39:33.622 --> 02:39:35.903]  At an airport, I just go without.
[02:39:36.483 --> 02:39:42.845]  All they had to do, five to ten years ago, all they had to do was phase out their toxic compounds and put in real food.
[02:39:42.845 --> 02:39:43.785]  And they would be big today.
[02:39:43.785 --> 02:39:44.686]  People would still go there.
[02:39:44.686 --> 02:39:49.187]  If they had organic options and it wasn't total, total junk, people would still go there.
[02:39:49.187 --> 02:39:53.509]  But now, instead, we have things like Indian soybean imports to U.S.
[02:39:53.509 --> 02:39:55.649]  jump as shoppers seek organic food.
[02:39:55.649 --> 02:40:03.292]  We won't buy GMO junk here, so India and Romania have to put, we have to import our organic produce from India and Romania.
[02:40:03.792 --> 02:40:04.273]  Here's one.
[02:40:04.273 --> 02:40:07.616]  Suddenly we like organic corn so much we have to go to Romania to get it.
[02:40:07.616 --> 02:40:11.680]  So we're importing organic food because we can't even keep up with the demand in the United States.
[02:40:11.680 --> 02:40:16.785]  And meanwhile, they're like, we need to have more GMO farms pop up to feed everybody.
[02:40:16.785 --> 02:40:26.474]  We can't even... And the farmers are so controlled by Monsanto and Arched Animals Midland, they're in their own bubble, a lot of them, not even knowing that there's this huge market and demand.
[02:40:27.495 --> 02:40:29.115]  For non-GMO.
[02:40:29.115 --> 02:40:30.596]  And then you think about it this way, too.
[02:40:30.596 --> 02:40:33.716]  As I said, we're importing organic soybeans from India.
[02:40:33.716 --> 02:40:36.737]  India is where a farmer's suicide happens on average every 30 minutes.
[02:40:36.737 --> 02:40:44.279]  A lot of it's tied into Monsanto having contracts with them, and then the farmer's killing themselves because they go into financial ruin, according to a lot of sources.
[02:40:44.279 --> 02:40:46.599]  And they kill themselves by drinking the pesticide.
[02:40:46.599 --> 02:40:49.360]  Yes, exactly, in a very darkly poetic way.
[02:40:50.097 --> 02:40:50.277]  I don't
[02:41:07.759 --> 02:41:15.522]  I mean, how many, what, three years ago, we talked about how McDonald's is on the way out, junk food is on the way out, people are eating real organic superfoods.
[02:41:15.522 --> 02:41:17.002]  Let's find the videos where we were right again.
[02:41:17.002 --> 02:41:20.644]  And we're not bragging, we're just letting you know, we really know what we're talking about.
[02:41:20.644 --> 02:41:20.844]  Yeah.
[02:41:20.844 --> 02:41:22.645]  I mean, we do research.
[02:41:22.645 --> 02:41:27.686]  When we, you know, have meetings here at the office, or we go out to dinner with the crew, we're talking about these issues.
[02:41:27.686 --> 02:41:29.407]  We're passionate.
[02:41:29.407 --> 02:41:34.349]  You go hang around with the anchors from ABC, NBC, CBS, I've done it, I mean, nightly news anchors.
[02:41:35.009 --> 02:41:37.874]  They're all about, oh, we know a lot of this stuff's true, Alex.
[02:41:37.874 --> 02:41:39.437]  Big deal, it's all just life.
[02:41:39.437 --> 02:41:41.139]  And they're talking about women.
[02:41:41.139 --> 02:41:42.882]  I mean, they're just mercenaries, folks.
[02:41:42.882 --> 02:41:44.044]  We're not mercenaries.
[02:41:44.044 --> 02:41:46.528]  We 100% believe this.
[02:41:46.528 --> 02:41:48.532]  We foam at the mouth for freedom.
[02:41:49.531 --> 02:41:52.934]  Well, that's why these products at Infowarslife.com are created.
[02:41:52.934 --> 02:41:55.476]  Yeah, let's do a plug, because I was already about to do this during the break.
[02:41:55.476 --> 02:41:57.979]  I already put my super male vitality in there.
[02:41:57.979 --> 02:41:59.460]  This falls in line with all of this.
[02:41:59.460 --> 02:42:02.963]  It's all about super high quality organic products that matter instead of producing them.
[02:42:02.963 --> 02:42:09.770]  Tell them about this article because I'm about to put some of the Secret 12 Methylcobalamin Vitamin B12 from Infowarslife.com in this water.
[02:42:10.310 --> 02:42:12.492]  And then you're supposed to take it sublingually to get the full effect.
[02:42:12.492 --> 02:42:16.356]  I just drink it like it's Sody Pop or Coke.
[02:42:16.356 --> 02:42:19.819]  And then I mix in the X2 nascent iodine.
[02:42:21.604 --> 02:42:23.525]  All of it in there together into a cocktail.
[02:42:23.525 --> 02:42:26.906]  I know some folks are actually putting this into their mixed drinks, but I don't really do it.
[02:42:26.906 --> 02:42:28.467]  Yeah, I put it in my protein shake every morning.
[02:42:28.467 --> 02:42:32.428]  I have every single product into the... And then there you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:42:32.428 --> 02:42:36.050]  I tell you, it is dynamite to mix these three things together.
[02:42:36.050 --> 02:42:41.732]  And then you just drink it down, and I tell you, the energy I get... I used to have coffee about this time of day.
[02:42:41.732 --> 02:42:46.334]  Now, I just have this, and I tell you, it gives me more energy, clean energy.
[02:42:46.334 --> 02:42:50.616]  Super Male X2 and the Vitamin B12, Methicabolamine.
[02:42:52.014 --> 02:42:53.977]  Than the Coke would.
[02:42:53.977 --> 02:42:57.241]  Or having something like a tea or a coffee.
[02:42:57.241 --> 02:43:00.245]  Yeah, I've probably had two cups of coffee in the last six to eight months.
[02:43:01.508 --> 02:43:06.952]  I used to either have a Coca-Cola, even though I know it's fattening and bad, or I would have a coffee, or I'd have a tea.
[02:43:06.952 --> 02:43:08.093]  Yeah.
[02:43:08.093 --> 02:43:09.454]  Very rarely do I do that anymore.
[02:43:09.454 --> 02:43:12.156]  Well, it's the methylcobalamin and the adenosylcobalamin.
[02:43:12.156 --> 02:43:16.619]  The methylcobalamin is the pharmaceutical-grade, medical-grade stuff that people actually inject in their bodies.
[02:43:16.619 --> 02:43:17.920]  Obviously, you don't inject this.
[02:43:17.920 --> 02:43:22.743]  But then the adenosylcobalamin is super bioavailable, so you pick the two most bioavailable sources.
[02:43:22.743 --> 02:43:25.686]  Because you go to, like, a pharmacy, you can get methylcobalamin sometimes.
[02:43:25.686 --> 02:43:26.466]  It's super expensive.
[02:43:26.466 --> 02:43:27.827]  Sometimes it's, like, a hundred bucks.
[02:43:27.827 --> 02:43:30.309]  But the adenosylcobalamin, I can't find that anywhere else.
[02:43:30.569 --> 02:43:33.290]  So this is the two most bioactive, bioavailable forms.
[02:43:33.290 --> 02:43:40.292]  We went to the chemist and said, what is the most organic, what is the most organically produced, and what fuses it together and allows your body to uptake it.
[02:43:40.292 --> 02:43:43.953]  And so it's 80% methylcobalamin and explain the other that's 20%.
[02:43:43.953 --> 02:43:44.993]  Adenosylcobalamin.
[02:43:44.993 --> 02:43:46.934]  So they're both bioactive forms.
[02:43:46.934 --> 02:43:53.175]  And I went online today, by the way, looking at other stuff, and I couldn't just help but have B12 pop up on Google News over and over again.
[02:43:53.175 --> 02:43:54.776]  So I'm going to go through a couple of them.
[02:43:54.776 --> 02:43:58.317]  Dr. Oz did a whole segment on end your energy crisis with vitamin B12.
[02:43:58.317 --> 02:43:59.077]  He has this
[02:43:59.697 --> 02:44:14.643]  Five page long report about B12 deficiency, lack of energy, mood changes, difficulty concentrating, tingling, numbness, inflammation, cracked tongue, and how he thinks B12 is one of the best ways to fix all that.
[02:44:14.643 --> 02:44:17.824]  Five ways B12 helps joint pain and arthritis sufferers.
[02:44:17.824 --> 02:44:22.006]  This is from Newsmax, and it goes into arthritis, everything like that.
[02:44:22.006 --> 02:44:24.827]  We're not making claims here, but this is some of the news going on.
[02:44:24.827 --> 02:44:27.728]  And then I wanted to read two reviews that really stood out on B12.
[02:44:29.557 --> 02:44:31.018]  We try to highlight a lot of the reviews.
[02:44:31.018 --> 02:44:36.041]  This is for Secret 12, our variety of B12 that we believe is the best available.
[02:44:36.041 --> 02:44:47.749]  Yes, this is the methylcobalamin meets the adenosylcobalamin at NymphoWarsLife.com and this is from Citizen1984 and it says, as a postman, I regularly walk 10 miles a day.
[02:44:47.749 --> 02:44:52.231]  Before using Secret 12, I would rely heavily on energy shots to get me through my week.
[02:44:52.231 --> 02:44:54.093]  Secret 12 has changed all that for me.
[02:44:54.093 --> 02:44:57.675]  It provided sustained energy throughout the entire day without any jitters.
[02:44:58.075 --> 02:45:02.099]  I will definitely be purchasing more and recommending it to my family, friends, and co-workers.
[02:45:18.217 --> 02:45:21.621]  And again, I went to a medical doctor a year ago to have my blood tested, everything checked.
[02:45:21.621 --> 02:45:23.382]  I had low blood pressure.
[02:45:23.382 --> 02:45:25.244]  Overall, I had a little bit high blood sugar.
[02:45:25.244 --> 02:45:29.108]  It wasn't pre-diabetic, it was pre-pre, like getting into that range.
[02:45:29.108 --> 02:45:30.750]  Now it's gone back down.
[02:45:30.750 --> 02:45:34.834]  And I got the injections of methylcobalamin right as we were developing this and getting ready.
[02:45:35.695 --> 02:45:37.797]  And it's just amazing the energy that gives you.
[02:45:37.797 --> 02:45:44.283]  This gives me the same effect as injectable vitamin B12 to where I haven't even renewed my prescription because I don't like needles.
[02:45:44.283 --> 02:45:45.624]  You know, they're tiny.
[02:45:45.624 --> 02:45:47.746]  I just drink it now and it works just as good.
[02:45:47.746 --> 02:45:49.148]  I mean, it's amazing!
[02:45:50.182 --> 02:45:51.623]  Yeah, the injectables are great.
[02:45:51.623 --> 02:45:52.404]  I've tried that before.
[02:45:52.404 --> 02:45:56.768]  The doctor always, I mean, he's just insane, just jabs it in there and it always is super painful.
[02:45:56.768 --> 02:45:59.190]  I like to just take this Secret 12 instead.
[02:45:59.190 --> 02:46:00.471]  And I do have another review too.
[02:46:00.471 --> 02:46:02.193]  This is from Infowarslife.com.
[02:46:02.193 --> 02:46:05.375]  This is by far the best vitamin B supplement I have ever tried.
[02:46:05.375 --> 02:46:08.258]  My mood and metabolism improve markedly when I take it.
[02:46:08.258 --> 02:46:14.804]  In my opinion, this Winter Sun and Survival Shield X2 are the holy trinity for health supplements on a daily regimen.
[02:46:14.804 --> 02:46:15.905]  I have tried many products.
[02:46:16.405 --> 02:46:21.871]  Many different supplements and combos thereof in the past and these are the only products that truly deliver what they claim to.
[02:46:21.871 --> 02:46:22.471]  It's true.
[02:46:22.471 --> 02:46:27.096]  And see folks, notice how we're into all sorts of weird stuff and how we research everything.
[02:46:27.096 --> 02:46:31.740]  I wanted to come out with the most game-changing hardcore stuff out there.
[02:46:32.501 --> 02:46:33.282]  And that's what we've done.
[02:46:33.282 --> 02:46:49.874]  That's why it's taken us three plus years to come out with a handful of products because we've probably got, what, ten different products in development that we just can't put out because we can't put it out perfectly and all our competitors are putting out stuff that's pretty good but not perfect or really bad.
[02:46:49.874 --> 02:46:50.695]  Yeah.
[02:46:50.695 --> 02:46:54.278]  And then I'm just like sitting here going, do we just put out something that isn't perfect
[02:46:55.069 --> 02:46:56.870]  Because it's better than nothing!
[02:46:56.870 --> 02:46:58.250]  I mean, are we too good?
[02:46:58.250 --> 02:47:02.131]  But then we always end up putting out something that's perfect every time.
[02:47:02.131 --> 02:47:06.153]  It's always like, well, it'll take six months to do it, but this is so much better and we just have to do it.
[02:47:06.153 --> 02:47:07.353]  It's all we have to do.
[02:47:07.353 --> 02:47:12.375]  But then we can't keep it in stock because it's so hard to manufacture, because you can't get absolutely perfect clean.
[02:47:12.375 --> 02:47:23.359]  I mean, we've got the lab studies that are on in fullwareslife.com from the biggest firms out there, and they call us and they go, it's one thing to have one deal that's above California standards, non-detectable, nothing.
[02:47:24.099 --> 02:47:26.683]  But you've got like 10 ingredients that are all clean.
[02:47:26.683 --> 02:47:29.487]  They say this is like Twilight Zone.
[02:47:29.487 --> 02:47:30.429]  I mean, we've had them say that.
[02:47:30.429 --> 02:47:31.530]  This is Twilight Zone.
[02:47:31.530 --> 02:47:34.996]  The ingredients that we pay for that are then put together at these laboratories.
[02:47:36.198 --> 02:47:39.440]  I actually remember the chemist said, I'm freaked out.
[02:47:39.440 --> 02:47:41.341]  He was freaked out because it was so clean.
[02:47:41.341 --> 02:47:43.923]  He didn't even understand how it could possibly be done.
[02:47:43.923 --> 02:47:47.525]  But it's because we're neurotic about it and obsessive about it and crazy about it.
[02:47:47.525 --> 02:47:52.748]  Well, let's just say, Grube, even though he used two other manufacturers, Grube got involved with this from the beginning and he's neurotic.
[02:47:52.748 --> 02:47:53.188]  Yes.
[02:47:53.188 --> 02:47:54.469]  I mean, he's really obsessed.
[02:47:54.469 --> 02:47:59.772]  Like, we had to go with other people because sometimes he just couldn't even find the stuff that we needed.
[02:47:59.772 --> 02:48:02.334]  You know, for some of the products, he makes most of the products.
[02:48:02.334 --> 02:48:02.854]  Yes.
[02:48:02.854 --> 02:48:05.416]  And he always looks at them and makes sure they're good and everything like that.
[02:48:05.996 --> 02:48:09.499]  We triple test them after they've already been tested by the companies.
[02:48:09.499 --> 02:48:13.102]  Plus, we know we have enemies that are out to get us that are testing our stuff.
[02:48:13.102 --> 02:48:15.384]  We have all our batches saved in a big safe.
[02:48:15.384 --> 02:48:18.547]  For anybody that ever tries to do a fake test and claim something, we have you.
[02:48:18.547 --> 02:48:19.448]  Just know that.
[02:48:19.448 --> 02:48:24.632]  Because we know we have enemies, we go to an even higher level of testing.
[02:48:24.632 --> 02:48:25.653]  Independent third parties.
[02:48:25.653 --> 02:48:28.095]  Because no weapon against us shall prosper.
[02:48:28.095 --> 02:48:30.837]  You see, we use the attacks to make us even stronger.
[02:48:30.837 --> 02:48:31.278]  Thank you.
[02:48:33.174 --> 02:48:35.016]  It's like training at altitude.
[02:48:35.016 --> 02:48:37.017]  It basically being under attack all the time.
[02:48:37.017 --> 02:48:38.038]  I've gotten where I enjoy it.
[02:48:38.038 --> 02:48:39.559]  It makes my life fun.
[02:48:39.559 --> 02:48:40.040]  I like it.
[02:48:40.040 --> 02:48:40.880]  Don't you?
[02:48:40.880 --> 02:48:48.627]  Not being attacked by 10,000 people a day is like walking around after being on the Himalayans for a couple years and you go down to the town and you're like, wow, this feels amazing.
[02:48:48.627 --> 02:48:49.487]  But you're kind of used to it.
[02:48:49.487 --> 02:48:51.269]  You kind of like the altitude.
[02:48:51.269 --> 02:48:52.450]  You kind of like the pressure of it.
[02:48:54.624 --> 02:48:55.844]  I'm sorry.
[02:48:55.844 --> 02:48:56.805]  I'm sorry.
[02:48:56.805 --> 02:48:58.225]  Infowarslife.com.
[02:48:58.225 --> 02:49:00.305]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[02:49:00.305 --> 02:49:02.266]  Infowarslife.com.
[02:49:02.266 --> 02:49:04.726]  And the silver, I'm not going to allow it to sell out.
[02:49:04.726 --> 02:49:08.667]  It'll be months until we get more colloidal silver in if I keep this special up.
[02:49:08.667 --> 02:49:15.649]  So we're going to stop it now so that we have enough to keep supplying folks the regular price over the next two months or so.
[02:49:15.649 --> 02:49:19.589]  So that'll end sometime today, maybe tomorrow, whenever we pull it.
[02:49:19.589 --> 02:49:22.370]  30% off a bottle of Silver Bullet Colloidal Silver.
[02:49:23.635 --> 02:49:25.196]  Or get two bottles, get two free.
[02:49:25.196 --> 02:49:27.678]  That's 50% off, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:49:27.678 --> 02:49:31.982]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:49:31.982 --> 02:49:35.365]  And what I do is I'll plug once an hour for five minutes or so.
[02:49:35.365 --> 02:49:39.248]  Most talk show hosts plug coming into a break, coming out of a break.
[02:49:39.248 --> 02:49:41.410]  And then they plug in the middle, and I get it.
[02:49:41.410 --> 02:49:42.511]  Radio is in trouble.
[02:49:42.511 --> 02:49:43.912]  The whole economy's in trouble.
[02:49:43.912 --> 02:49:48.876]  Advertising's in trouble with our great, glorious New World Order leader under Cloward and Pivot.
[02:49:48.876 --> 02:49:49.336]  We just do
[02:49:50.057 --> 02:49:54.759]  You know, actually less advertising than most people, but I want to thank you all for your support.
[02:49:54.759 --> 02:49:56.480]  You make it all possible.
[02:49:56.480 --> 02:49:58.681]  And I also want to thank our AM and FM affiliates.
[02:49:58.681 --> 02:50:02.203]  It is essential that you spread the word about all these affiliates.
[02:50:02.203 --> 02:50:05.364]  It is essential that you call them and thank them for carrying the show.
[02:50:05.364 --> 02:50:15.309]  It is essential that you do things like call them and become a sponsor, or pay to put a billboard up plugging their station.
[02:50:15.309 --> 02:50:18.191]  That won't save the world, but all of us together will.
[02:50:19.048 --> 02:50:28.675]  And finally, we lost Orlando affiliate for about a year because ESPN came in and they had to make money and offered them so much, they did it.
[02:50:28.675 --> 02:50:32.818]  But then they found the ratings and things went down, so they picked us back up.
[02:50:32.818 --> 02:50:35.961]  We have Corpus Christi had us on for like five, six years.
[02:50:36.781 --> 02:50:38.262]  ESPN again came in.
[02:50:38.262 --> 02:50:38.742]  That's gone.
[02:50:38.742 --> 02:50:39.983]  They're putting us back on.
[02:50:39.983 --> 02:50:43.145]  So what happens is, even affiliates that leave us come back.
[02:50:43.145 --> 02:50:44.726]  So we're gaining more stations.
[02:50:44.726 --> 02:50:46.708]  It's up like 185 right now.
[02:50:46.708 --> 02:50:49.129]  And I want to salute and thank all those affiliates.
[02:50:49.129 --> 02:50:51.851]  But folks, put 50 bucks in an envelope.
[02:50:51.851 --> 02:50:53.032]  Mail it to them.
[02:50:53.032 --> 02:50:57.635]  Because we need to not just have our stations survive, but thrive and pray for them.
[02:50:59.782 --> 02:51:07.165]  Many are in disbelief today after word of shocking allegations against a Minnesota-based talk syndication company known as GCN.
[02:51:07.165 --> 02:51:18.370]  It's claimed that they're the fourth largest talk syndication company in the U.S., making it even more scandalous that they've been accused of helping business owners expose themselves on a massive scale.
[02:51:18.370 --> 02:51:20.471]  Let's go live to Tom for more on this story.
[02:51:21.111 --> 02:51:24.373]  It's being called the greatest exposure of our lifetime.
[02:51:24.373 --> 02:51:31.498]  While other business owners are beginning to step forward claiming they too exposed themselves with the help of GCN.
[02:51:31.498 --> 02:51:32.899]  It's true, they're all guilty.
[02:51:32.899 --> 02:51:34.240]  Every last one of them.
[02:51:34.240 --> 02:51:38.824]  GCN helped me get the exposure my company needed and just think, that was years ago.
[02:51:38.824 --> 02:51:45.048]  Today, GCN has like 700 affiliate stations and over 6 million downloads from iTunes and their website every month.
[02:51:45.048 --> 02:51:47.490]  Imagine the exposure your company can get.
[02:51:47.910 --> 02:51:50.334]  Expose your business to the masses.
[02:51:50.334 --> 02:51:53.641]  Email advertise at GCNLive.com.
[02:51:53.641 --> 02:51:54.061]  Easy.
[02:51:54.061 --> 02:51:54.963]  Affordable.
[02:51:54.963 --> 02:51:55.825]  Effective.
[02:51:55.825 --> 02:51:57.247]  GCN.
[02:51:58.206 --> 02:52:04.449]  It's time to build your own emergency food stockpile with the industry leader, MyPatriotSupply.

[02:53:13.328 --> 02:53:20.272]  This transmission is coming to you.
[02:53:20.272 --> 02:53:24.655]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:53:24.655 --> 02:53:30.258]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:53:57.788 --> 02:54:04.133]  This is the most transparent administration in history, and I can document how that is the case.
[02:54:04.133 --> 02:54:10.357]  American journalists at a media event have criticized the US administration over transparency issues.
[02:54:10.357 --> 02:54:13.159]  We cover what we are allowed to cover.
[02:54:13.159 --> 02:54:15.941]  Lack of transparency is a huge political advantage.
[02:54:15.941 --> 02:54:22.286]  Information management has become so sophisticated, every administration learns from the previous one.
[02:54:22.286 --> 02:54:22.827]  I've got a pen.
[02:54:23.707 --> 02:54:24.648]  And I've got a phone.
[02:54:24.648 --> 02:54:27.831]  There are actions I have the legal authority to take as President.
[02:54:27.831 --> 02:54:32.815]  What do you say to someone who believes the President took action to change the law?
[02:54:32.815 --> 02:54:33.956]  We did not change the law.
[02:54:33.956 --> 02:54:35.178]  We acted within the law.
[02:54:35.178 --> 02:54:40.963]  What you're not paying attention to is the fact that I just took an action to change the law.
[02:54:50.015 --> 02:54:52.097]  Breaking the law!
[02:54:52.097 --> 02:54:53.718]  Breaking the law!
[02:54:53.718 --> 02:54:54.659]  Breaking the law!
[02:54:54.659 --> 02:54:56.761]  Breaking the law!
[02:54:56.761 --> 02:54:57.822]  Breaking the law!
[02:54:57.822 --> 02:54:58.642]  Breaking the law!
[02:54:58.642 --> 02:54:59.603]  Breaking the law!
[02:54:59.603 --> 02:55:00.524]  Breaking the law!
[02:55:00.524 --> 02:55:03.606]  Breaking the law!
[02:55:03.606 --> 02:55:06.248]  From the front lines of the information war.
[02:55:06.248 --> 02:55:09.972]  From the front lines of the information war.
[02:55:09.972 --> 02:55:12.474]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:55:12.474 --> 02:55:14.255]  That is a powerful intro.
[02:55:14.255 --> 02:55:16.857]  Brought to you by Infowars.com.
[02:55:16.857 --> 02:55:17.538]  Hey, good news!
[02:55:19.881 --> 02:55:22.102]  Good news in a big way.
[02:55:22.102 --> 02:55:28.203]  Anthony Gugiardi and Joe Biggs are going to host an entire fourth hour of the show.
[02:55:28.203 --> 02:55:29.863]  Not just 30 minutes.
[02:55:29.863 --> 02:55:35.565]  We're kicking this off very soon where every day the fourth hour will be live, but magazine style.
[02:55:35.565 --> 02:55:37.045]  And a couple days a week I'll be there.
[02:55:37.045 --> 02:55:39.266]  Special reports are going to get aired there.
[02:55:39.266 --> 02:55:44.767]  We're going to have Anthony in, Jakari Jackson, Darren McBreen is going to do a great job hosting live.
[02:55:44.767 --> 02:55:48.608]  We're going to have them all in here hosting live.
[02:55:50.111 --> 02:55:57.195]  Every day in the fourth hour, it's going to be like a post-game show.
[02:55:57.195 --> 02:56:03.839]  But the newest stuff breaking, what's coming up on the nightly news, because we're going to TV syndication starting in just about a month.
[02:56:03.839 --> 02:56:06.261]  In fact, we're already up on the satellite, haven't really announced all that yet.
[02:56:07.321 --> 02:56:08.682]  And I want to bring that fourth hour back.
[02:56:08.682 --> 02:56:19.605]  I've already got a contract to pay for the closed captioning for five hours a day, four hours of radio TV with the Alex Jones Live, InfoWars Live, whatever you want to call it, the daytime show, and then the Downy News' one hour show.
[02:56:19.605 --> 02:56:20.066]  We're doing it!
[02:56:20.066 --> 02:56:25.248]  I'm getting everybody used to it today with kind of like snap war drills.
[02:56:25.248 --> 02:56:26.708]  I'm just like, you know what?
[02:56:26.708 --> 02:56:28.229]  Gucciardi?
[02:56:28.229 --> 02:56:29.849]  Biggs just got back off a plane.
[02:56:29.849 --> 02:56:31.430]  David Knight's going on vacation for a week.
[02:56:32.950 --> 02:56:37.673]  Well-deserved, so both these guys are going to be in here taking your phone calls and more.
[02:56:37.673 --> 02:56:45.157]  But right now, speaking of our article at DrugsReport.com, Financial Times calls for abolishing cash.
[02:56:45.157 --> 02:56:50.981]  Well, that doesn't mean Johnny Cash songs, but you're on the air, Mr. Cash, calling from Missouri.
[02:56:50.981 --> 02:56:51.341]  Go ahead.
[02:56:53.303 --> 02:56:54.483]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:56:54.483 --> 02:56:57.204]  I've got a question, and two statements if you have time.
[02:56:57.204 --> 02:56:58.465]  Yes, sir.
[02:56:58.465 --> 02:57:05.907]  The question is, the government, CIA, is the biggest drug dealer, and it uses it to fund the black budget.
[02:57:05.907 --> 02:57:13.169]  Well, if the drug dealers don't take credit cards, so if they abolish cash, that would kill their cash cow.
[02:57:13.169 --> 02:57:17.610]  And how are the big banks going to launder their drug cash if there is no cash?
[02:57:17.938 --> 02:57:18.939]  I've always said that.
[02:57:18.939 --> 02:57:29.990]  Why would the big five banks, it was six, be trying to ban cash or restrict cash everywhere when they launder, let's be conservative, the CIA Inspector General said $300 billion a year in 1997.
[02:57:31.843 --> 02:57:36.666]  Now it's about 500 billion a year just in North America alone.
[02:57:36.666 --> 02:57:40.027]  I thought about that so much it makes my head spin.
[02:57:40.027 --> 02:57:44.270]  It's just like when they bring in driverless cars, how are they going to make money on insurance?
[02:57:44.270 --> 02:57:51.173]  Well, as they phase humans out driving, they're just going to jack it up on us and then have some type of safety fee.
[02:57:51.173 --> 02:57:58.017]  The driverless cars are still going to be having crashes and having problems and having malfunctions, or it'll go to some innovation fee.
[02:57:58.017 --> 02:58:00.198]  I mean, believe me, they got ways to screw us over.
[02:58:00.698 --> 02:58:06.362]  And I believe they're just going to quasi-outlaw cash, but still have that operating and still have debit cards.
[02:58:06.362 --> 02:58:16.508]  But the big banks are so above the law now, they're getting to a point where they'll just take credit cards and let drug dealers operate openly, and then they'll selectively not get in trouble.
[02:58:16.508 --> 02:58:19.791]  I mean, the big banks already launder the drug money and don't get in trouble.
[02:58:19.791 --> 02:58:21.172]  So I think that's what's happening.
[02:58:21.172 --> 02:58:22.572]  Let me ask you this question.
[02:58:22.572 --> 02:58:23.493]  What do you think?
[02:58:23.493 --> 02:58:24.714]  How do you think they're going to do that cash?
[02:58:26.716 --> 02:58:32.003]  Well, I'm not real sure, but I think when you talk about driverless cars, I think they're... Stay there, Cash.
[02:58:32.003 --> 02:58:33.004]  You held a long time.
[02:58:33.004 --> 02:58:34.966]  I want to give you some time straight ahead.
[02:58:34.966 --> 02:58:36.188]  Back in 70 seconds.
[02:58:36.188 --> 02:58:40.854]  Some stations don't carry the fourth hour because I quit doing it for a while, but it's back.
[02:58:40.854 --> 02:58:43.156]  If not, tune into your safe station and support them.
[02:58:43.156 --> 02:58:44.838]  We'll be back for folks at InfoWars.com.
[02:58:48.724 --> 02:58:52.808]  Alex Jones here with a very important news alert for InfoWars listeners.
[02:58:52.808 --> 02:59:03.277]  We've confirmed through our major suppliers attempting to resupply Survival Shield X2 Deep Earth Crystals that elite corporations are buying up the supplies all over the world.
[02:59:03.277 --> 02:59:06.200]  So prices are going up and it's very hard to secure it.
[02:59:06.340 --> 02:59:15.483]  We have been able to secure a limited supply of the Pure Deep Earth Crystals and have now been able to produce more Survival Shield Nascent Iodine X2.
[02:59:15.483 --> 02:59:17.004]  This is the good halogen.
[02:59:17.004 --> 02:59:20.045]  This is the opposite of the bad halogens like fluoride.
[02:59:20.045 --> 02:59:32.069]  Now we at InfoWarsLife.com are bringing you the only source of clean, pure, 99.99 Ultra Pure Deep Earth Crystals from more than 7,000 feet below the Earth's surface.
[02:59:32.069 --> 02:59:33.330]  Watch the informational videos.
[02:59:33.670 --> 02:59:35.873]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:00:01.320 --> 03:00:07.963]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:00:07.963 --> 03:00:10.884]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:31.345 --> 03:00:46.793]  Yeah, well, this leads into that, but first of all, there's a foundation who has developed a free energy technology which is available for sale and it's going to start to be shipped worldwide within the next 60 to 90 days.
[03:00:46.793 --> 03:00:49.074]  It's called the Keshe Foundation.org.
[03:00:49.074 --> 03:00:53.076]  That's K-E-S-H-E Foundation.org.
[03:00:53.076 --> 03:01:00.500]  They have a unit that's going to cost $500 that will provide 3 to 5 kilowatts of energy.
[03:01:02.347 --> 03:01:03.548]  Independently.
[03:01:03.548 --> 03:01:06.289]  Hook this into your house system, hook it into your business system.
[03:01:06.289 --> 03:01:19.114]  You know, I know they've got some cool alternative energy systems that have been suppressed, but I don't know about this group, but I've heard this before over the last 20 years, that a group's coming out, a foundation under different names, and they're going to ship it.
[03:01:19.114 --> 03:01:20.295]  Have you seen the machine?
[03:01:20.295 --> 03:01:22.276]  I mean, has it worked for you?
[03:01:22.276 --> 03:01:27.278]  I have not seen the machine because they're now taking orders for it.
[03:01:28.181 --> 03:01:34.826]  They're promising to ship it within the next 30 to 60 days, maybe 90 days tops.
[03:01:34.826 --> 03:01:36.087]  But it is available.
[03:01:36.087 --> 03:01:37.608]  They are producing it.
[03:01:37.608 --> 03:01:39.589]  I'll have to look into that.
[03:01:39.589 --> 03:01:40.370]  That's very interesting.
[03:01:40.370 --> 03:01:44.152]  What's your take on driverless cars?
[03:01:44.152 --> 03:01:47.514]  Well, that is another one of their technologies.
[03:01:47.514 --> 03:01:55.500]  They've also are planning to have developed cars that not only are driverless,
[03:01:56.673 --> 03:01:58.343]  Uh, but they are, um...
[03:02:00.154 --> 03:02:01.795]  They don't need roads.
[03:02:01.795 --> 03:02:03.936]  They need lift technology.
[03:02:03.936 --> 03:02:15.543]  Well, they have come out actually in the last 50 years with flying cars that are under $80,000 and Australia is looking at actually legalizing them in some areas and that sounds pretty darn fine.
[03:02:15.543 --> 03:02:21.947]  Well, you said before that the current technology that we have today, they had 40, 50 years ago.
[03:02:21.947 --> 03:02:27.370]  Oh yeah, they had cars 60 years ago that got 50 miles a gallon and didn't have any electronics in them.
[03:02:28.171 --> 03:02:30.173]  Now that he's got all this electronics, he can't even do that.
[03:02:39.727 --> 03:02:43.228]  You know, Tesla has the power cell too, which is a really cool thing.
[03:02:43.228 --> 03:02:50.729]  You can plug it into your house and it basically generates massive amounts of power in a preparedness type of way and Elon Musk presented it a while back.
[03:02:50.729 --> 03:02:56.251]  It's pretty interesting and apparently it can have massive... Hey, we should send out a crew to the Elon Musk factory.
[03:02:56.251 --> 03:02:58.991]  They'll let us look at it and then send one to this guy and investigate.
[03:02:58.991 --> 03:02:59.951]  See if it's legitimate.
[03:02:59.951 --> 03:03:00.472]  Thank you, sir.
[03:03:00.472 --> 03:03:00.992]  God bless you.
[03:03:00.992 --> 03:03:01.852]  Good to hear from you, Cash.
[03:03:02.492 --> 03:03:03.752]  Cash is a cool name.
[03:03:03.752 --> 03:03:05.453]  Let's talk to Jason in Minnesota.
[03:03:05.453 --> 03:03:05.993]  You're on the air.
[03:03:05.993 --> 03:03:13.095]  Anthony is going to be sitting here and co-piloting is going to be Joe Beggs.
[03:03:13.095 --> 03:03:15.115]  Hey Alex, how are you doing?
[03:03:15.115 --> 03:03:18.416]  Good brother, good to talk to you.
[03:03:18.416 --> 03:03:29.038]  I'm stuck in Minnesota with a bunch of liberals like Klobuchar and Franklin and we had Black Lives Matter coming to the State's Fair tomorrow.
[03:03:29.038 --> 03:03:30.339]  I'm going tomorrow.
[03:03:30.339 --> 03:03:31.959]  So I just want to kind of
[03:03:33.533 --> 03:03:39.174]  Get your take on what, you know, verbiage I could say without getting in too much trouble.
[03:03:39.174 --> 03:03:43.275]  Sure, well Rand Paul's like, I really... I think... Go ahead, sorry.
[03:03:43.275 --> 03:03:50.356]  No, no, it's just Rand Paul's like, I support what you're doing to stop people getting killed, but you need to go about it better.
[03:03:50.356 --> 03:03:51.576]  That's too nice.
[03:03:51.576 --> 03:03:59.158]  When a group is racist, out of control, blocking people's cars just because they're white, I mean, I think the answer to them without getting in a fight is just like, hey,
[03:03:59.838 --> 03:04:01.379]  I haven't done anything.
[03:04:01.379 --> 03:04:02.299]  Stop pushing this.
[03:04:02.299 --> 03:04:04.540]  You're funded by the globalists to create, divide and conquer.
[03:04:04.540 --> 03:04:07.721]  If you want to go get in somebody's face, go find a Klan rally.
[03:04:07.721 --> 03:04:11.262]  Quit treating me like I've done something because of my skin color.
[03:04:11.262 --> 03:04:15.604]  And I mean, you know, personally, I need to seek out Black Lives Matter because I want to get in their face.
[03:04:15.604 --> 03:04:18.665]  I think it's very arrogant, very idiotic.
[03:04:18.665 --> 03:04:19.885]  But I mean, that's what I think.
[03:04:19.885 --> 03:04:23.807]  I think you should go out there with some friends and videotape it.
[03:04:23.807 --> 03:04:24.547]  Exactly.
[03:04:24.547 --> 03:04:25.868]  I mean, that's the way I feel.
[03:04:25.868 --> 03:04:26.808]  I mean, someone even
[03:04:27.483 --> 03:04:29.904]  Drove them over when they were blocking the road here.
[03:04:29.904 --> 03:04:31.545]  I don't know if you've seen that on the news.
[03:04:31.545 --> 03:04:32.725]  But, you know, they ran them over.
[03:04:32.725 --> 03:04:34.906]  They're disruptive.
[03:04:34.906 --> 03:04:36.287]  They're really arrogant.
[03:04:36.287 --> 03:04:38.348]  Well, because they're buying into the MSNBC.
[03:04:40.029 --> 03:04:41.451]  They're buying into the MSNBC narrative.
[03:04:41.451 --> 03:04:46.858]  Listen, don't hang up, Jason, because that's what Joe Biggs wants to talk about, is the shooting and the whole Black Lives Matter thing.
[03:04:46.858 --> 03:04:49.201]  So we'll come back to you after they talk a while.
[03:04:49.201 --> 03:04:50.682]  Then Steve, Adam, and others, 800-259-9231.
[03:04:50.682 --> 03:04:52.785]  Tweet, tell your friends, a whole other hour of live radio.

[03:05:59.043 --> 03:06:03.146]  Alex Jones here with a very important news alert for InfoWars listeners.
[03:06:03.146 --> 03:06:13.614]  We've confirmed through our major suppliers attempting to resupply Survival Shield X2 Deep Earth Crystals that elite corporations are buying up the supplies all over the world.
[03:06:13.614 --> 03:06:16.516]  So prices are going up and it's very hard to secure it.
[03:06:16.636 --> 03:06:25.460]  We have been able to secure a limited supply of the Pure Deep Earth Crystals and have now been able to produce more Survival Shield Nascent Iodine X2.
[03:06:25.460 --> 03:06:27.321]  This is the good halogen.

[03:07:00.109 --> 03:07:04.091]  Thousands of people seeking home security get ripped off every day.
[03:07:04.091 --> 03:07:08.112]  And the home security industry wants you to believe that's your only option.
[03:07:08.112 --> 03:07:13.594]  They've got hordes of salesmen out there trying to scare you into signing one of their long-term contracts.
[03:07:13.594 --> 03:07:18.496]  You get stuck writing huge checks month after month with no way out.
[03:07:18.496 --> 03:07:22.018]  It's robbery by contract and it can cost you thousands.
[03:07:22.018 --> 03:07:24.439]  But there's a better way to protect your home.

[03:08:00.014 --> 03:08:05.424]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:05.424 --> 03:08:07.709]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[03:08:20.724 --> 03:08:22.605]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:22.605 --> 03:08:29.689]  I'm Anthony Gucciardi sitting in for Alex Jones, the wing commander, here with Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs.
[03:08:29.689 --> 03:08:37.973]  And Joe just got back from going down to Virginia to check out the latest on the shooting, the news shooting, and he's going to share with us what's going on.
[03:08:37.973 --> 03:08:42.635]  And we're going to talk about the Pope visiting and how he is aligning himself with Obama.
[03:08:42.635 --> 03:08:47.218]  We're going to take calls on Trump, Black Lives Matter, GMOs,
[03:08:48.348 --> 03:08:49.549]  Trains, whatever that is.
[03:08:49.549 --> 03:08:51.190]  Oh, so on and so forth.
[03:08:51.190 --> 03:08:55.373]  Lots of stuff still to cover throughout this fourth hour, which we will be going through.
[03:08:55.373 --> 03:08:59.856]  But Joe, what happened in Virginia when you went to visit and investigate the new shooter?
[03:09:00.472 --> 03:09:08.496]  Yes, so I went out to Virginia to find out what's going on with this new shooting because immediately this tragedy happens and what happens?
[03:09:08.496 --> 03:09:19.522]  The mainstream media, the government, everyone is jumping on this gun control bandwagon, anti-gun, let's get rid of guns, let's not hold individuals accountable for what's going on.
[03:09:19.522 --> 03:09:22.464]  But now you also have a lot of these people out here saying that it's all a hoax.
[03:09:23.084 --> 03:09:29.308]  I went out there, I saw the boards that they had to cut around the bodies, the blood that spewed from the second floor down to the first floor.
[03:09:29.308 --> 03:09:30.429]  It was not a hoax.
[03:09:30.429 --> 03:09:33.271]  There's a lot of people saying that there's timestamps different on these Twitters.
[03:09:33.271 --> 03:09:42.997]  It's so easy to go into Twitter and manipulate a time and then take a screenshot and then post it and make a video and sit back and watch people just nitpick at it.
[03:09:42.997 --> 03:09:49.242]  Or the fact that in one video, this guy has a long black sleeve thing on, but then when you see his arm extended, you see blue.
[03:09:49.242 --> 03:09:52.764]  Well, that's going to happen whenever with your suit, extend your arm.
[03:09:53.766 --> 03:09:54.327]  Exactly.
[03:09:54.327 --> 03:09:56.713]  I can see another color under there.
[03:09:56.713 --> 03:09:57.174]  Voila!
[03:09:57.174 --> 03:09:57.915]  It's magic.
[03:09:57.915 --> 03:10:01.363]  No, that's what happens when you wear two layers of shirt or clothing.
[03:10:03.132 --> 03:10:04.854]  So people are just trying to nitpick.
[03:10:04.854 --> 03:10:09.979]  The horrendous thing is, the hoax of it all, is the fact that people are jumping on this.
[03:10:09.979 --> 03:10:12.701]  Like they say, never let a bad situation go to waste.
[03:10:12.701 --> 03:10:13.842]  And people are jumping on it.
[03:10:13.842 --> 03:10:14.483]  They're using it.
[03:10:14.483 --> 03:10:16.845]  They got to the family while they're emotional.
[03:10:16.845 --> 03:10:18.807]  And they're trying to push for gun control.
[03:10:18.807 --> 03:10:27.234]  Now, Jakari, I don't know if you found the video yet, but he was telling me earlier, right when I got in, that there's footage of the father saying that, yeah, he's going to go out and buy a gun.
[03:10:27.234 --> 03:10:28.215]  He's a gun supporter.
[03:10:29.056 --> 03:10:32.338]  But you have the people, you have the government, you have the mainstream media.
[03:10:32.338 --> 03:10:36.741]  MSNBC, I was up late last night watching, and they're sitting there going, oh, you know, guns are bad.
[03:10:36.741 --> 03:10:42.065]  And you got Piers Morgan tweet, it's another senseless act of violence, gun violence in America.
[03:10:42.065 --> 03:10:44.927]  How many more do we have to have before we get rid of guns and end this?
[03:10:45.475 --> 03:10:47.877]  You know, right, it's the same narrative every single time.
[03:10:47.877 --> 03:10:54.101]  And you talk about those who think it was a staged event, which we have two things that happen every single time during a shooting, right?
[03:10:54.101 --> 03:10:57.704]  So first and foremost, we have the gun control pushers.
[03:10:57.704 --> 03:11:02.367]  And it's so funny to me that we even continue to debate gun control if you look at the FBI statistics.
[03:11:02.367 --> 03:11:06.230]  And again, this isn't even an area that I'm super into at this moment, but I've done
[03:11:06.710 --> 03:11:08.411]  Time and time again, videos on this.
[03:11:08.411 --> 03:11:11.032]  I remember the FBI statistics.
[03:11:11.032 --> 03:11:19.477]  It's 980,000 potential deaths, so it's crimes that could relate to death, were stopped every single year from gun use.
[03:11:19.477 --> 03:11:22.198]  Like brandishing a firearm or something like that.
[03:11:22.198 --> 03:11:25.160]  It's stopping so many deaths over and over again.
[03:11:25.160 --> 03:11:30.823]  And there's less than, what, 900 overall deaths from pistols every single year in the United States.
[03:11:30.823 --> 03:11:32.384]  And of those, how many are criminals?
[03:11:32.384 --> 03:11:34.525]  It's such a lame debate to even have.
[03:11:34.605 --> 03:11:35.806]  I mean, look at it.
[03:11:35.806 --> 03:11:37.348]  Go back to biblical times.
[03:11:37.348 --> 03:11:38.649]  They didn't have guns.
[03:11:38.649 --> 03:11:39.190]  What did they use?
[03:11:39.190 --> 03:11:39.870]  Cain and Abel.
[03:11:39.870 --> 03:11:40.451]  Rocks.
[03:11:40.451 --> 03:11:45.016]  And do you really think that guy was going to not kill the woman and the cameraman if he didn't have a gun?
[03:11:45.016 --> 03:11:46.517]  He'd been planning for over a year.
[03:11:46.517 --> 03:11:47.578]  He was deeply mentally ill.
[03:11:47.578 --> 03:11:50.381]  Yeah, this guy was out of control, out of his mind.
[03:11:50.381 --> 03:11:54.045]  He had been sitting there methodically planning this entire thing out for so long.
[03:11:54.565 --> 03:11:57.307]  If he could have got his hand on a gun, he would have figured something out.
[03:11:57.307 --> 03:12:04.471]  He would have ran him off the road, he could have ran up and stabbed the camera guy first because that's a bigger threat, a bigger guy, and then went after the lady.
[03:12:04.471 --> 03:12:06.192]  You know, there's all kinds of ways.
[03:12:06.192 --> 03:12:12.516]  If somebody intends to do harm and they have that hate in their heart, they will figure out a way to carry out that attack.
[03:12:12.516 --> 03:12:14.057]  Well, remember the school stabbing too.
[03:12:14.057 --> 03:12:19.400]  I believe the kid killed or at least stabbed seven or eight or nine, seven, eight, nine people.
[03:12:19.400 --> 03:12:20.221]  And he didn't have a gun.
[03:12:20.221 --> 03:12:22.142]  He had a box cutter or something like that.
[03:12:22.443 --> 03:12:29.174]  I really want to go out and do a social experiment while I lay a pistol down somewhere out in public, you know, and just watch how many people walk by.
[03:12:30.086 --> 03:12:36.589]  And get footage of that and show that that gun is not going to grow arms and legs, stand up and go on a shooting rampage.
[03:12:36.589 --> 03:12:37.810]  It's not going to happen.
[03:12:37.810 --> 03:12:43.772]  It takes a sick individual to get behind that and use that tool for the wrong reasons.
[03:12:43.772 --> 03:12:53.377]  But just because a bad accident happened, because a crime happens, we shouldn't have to demonize and or strip liberties away from people.
[03:12:53.377 --> 03:12:56.018]  The right to protect themselves shall not be infringed.
[03:12:56.458 --> 03:12:57.359]  Yes.
[03:12:57.359 --> 03:12:57.959]  Go ahead.
[03:12:57.959 --> 03:13:02.241]  I do want to take calls, but at the same time I also want to relate what you're saying to the Internet.
[03:13:02.241 --> 03:13:05.382]  Because you could say that the Internet, oh it's a tool of horrible things.
[03:13:05.382 --> 03:13:07.123]  It's made people kill themselves.
[03:13:07.123 --> 03:13:09.123]  You know, children have killed themselves.
[03:13:09.123 --> 03:13:10.084]  Defamation has happened.
[03:13:10.084 --> 03:13:11.464]  All these horrible things have happened.
[03:13:11.464 --> 03:13:17.087]  The Internet is an open source tool for those to do good and spread the word like we do or ruin people's lives.
[03:13:17.087 --> 03:13:19.928]  And a great example of that is a San Antonio police officer.
[03:13:19.928 --> 03:13:22.289]  His email popped up on the Ashley Madison account.
[03:13:22.289 --> 03:13:24.330]  You can go and check to see if your email pops on there.
[03:13:24.750 --> 03:13:25.911]  He committed suicide.
[03:13:25.911 --> 03:13:27.853]  He thought that his family was going to hate him.
[03:13:27.853 --> 03:13:28.634]  This and that.
[03:13:28.634 --> 03:13:35.321]  And come to find out, it was a cop, black guy, who wrote this, made up a lie, and put that in there.
[03:13:35.321 --> 03:13:36.022]  Ban the internet.
[03:13:36.022 --> 03:13:37.003]  Ban the internet.
[03:13:37.003 --> 03:13:39.646]  I think we should probably ban the internet.
[03:13:39.646 --> 03:13:41.107]  But let's take a couple calls.
[03:13:41.107 --> 03:13:45.512]  Let's talk to Jason on Black Lives Matter, because I know Joe wants to speak on this specifically.
[03:13:45.512 --> 03:13:46.213]  Jason, what's up?
[03:13:48.018 --> 03:13:49.879]  Hey guys, how you doing?
[03:13:49.879 --> 03:14:08.389]  Um, yeah, I was just, you know, I'm just, I guess I'm just frustrated that Black Lives Matter would have the audacity to go to a state fair where there's family, children, kids trying to enjoy, you know, a day to celebrate Minnesota, its culture and all that stuff.
[03:14:08.389 --> 03:14:14.192]  And you're going to have these people protesting and you know, they're not peaceful protesters either.
[03:14:14.192 --> 03:14:15.033]  You know, they're, they're,
[03:14:15.697 --> 03:14:17.378]  You know, they block people.
[03:14:17.378 --> 03:14:19.620]  They do stuff.
[03:14:19.620 --> 03:14:20.120]  It's artificial protest.
[03:14:20.120 --> 03:14:22.902]  They should go to the Capitol or a police department.
[03:14:22.902 --> 03:14:25.544]  They should, you know, I just don't understand it.
[03:14:25.544 --> 03:14:29.406]  And I'm, you know, I'm going to have to be in that mix.
[03:14:29.406 --> 03:14:34.249]  I don't know how far into it I'm going to be or, you know, what's going to happen.
[03:14:34.249 --> 03:14:39.353]  But I mean, I'm sure verbally, I'm going to be a little, you know, a little loud at them.
[03:14:39.818 --> 03:14:45.279]  Right, and Joe, I want your take on this, but my view on this is it's artificial form of protesting.
[03:14:45.279 --> 03:14:49.680]  Because if you really want to protest something, like March Against Monsanto is a real protest movement.
[03:14:49.680 --> 03:14:56.442]  They go to capitals, they get permits, they speak about facts, they speak about Roundup being linked to cancer by the World Health Organization.
[03:14:56.442 --> 03:14:57.122]  I've spoken at them.
[03:14:57.122 --> 03:14:57.842]  It's real.
[03:14:57.842 --> 03:14:58.943]  It's a real thing.
[03:14:58.943 --> 03:15:05.644]  And also at the same time, I support awesome black people, transgender people like the ones earlier who were saying arrest Hillary Clinton.
[03:15:05.644 --> 03:15:06.304]  They're awesome.
[03:15:06.304 --> 03:15:06.784]  I don't care.
[03:15:06.784 --> 03:15:07.805]  You can be transgender.
[03:15:07.805 --> 03:15:08.765]  Do whatever you want.
[03:15:09.125 --> 03:15:11.286]  I have no ill will to these people.
[03:15:11.286 --> 03:15:17.550]  But at the same time, if it's artificially inflated that, oh, you hate black people, you hate transgender people, no I don't, not at all.
[03:15:17.550 --> 03:15:23.933]  You're gonna go and block the highway and tell me that I'm a bad person for no reason other than me literally being white?
[03:15:23.933 --> 03:15:29.016]  That is the most racist thing you could possibly do, and you have first-hand experience with all this stuff.
[03:15:29.736 --> 03:15:34.662]  Yeah, see, there's a lot of people out there in the Black Lives Matter movement that I've met personally in Ferguson.
[03:15:34.662 --> 03:15:35.482]  Great people.
[03:15:35.482 --> 03:15:37.224]  And they're there for pure reasons.
[03:15:37.224 --> 03:15:45.253]  But you have people like DeRay McKesson, the so-called head of Black Lives Matter, who uses racism to so-called defeat racism.
[03:15:45.253 --> 03:15:47.195]  He calls people out on their whiteness.
[03:15:47.816 --> 03:15:53.421]  You know, I try to confront him a couple times, and I talk to him, and he's like, oh, just excuse your whiteness, get your whiteness away from me.
[03:15:53.421 --> 03:15:54.541]  That's extremely racist!
[03:15:54.541 --> 03:15:58.845]  How are you going to beat racism by being blatantly racist?
[03:15:58.845 --> 03:16:07.812]  And his tweets all the time, all it does is stir up young people who are emotional, who have maybe had something happen in their lifetime, and they use that, that hate.
[03:16:07.812 --> 03:16:12.095]  And then you have the Rev Com come in, and they boost him up even more, the Revolutionary Communist Party.
[03:16:12.095 --> 03:16:14.657]  These guys show up to these events, and they help stir the pot.
[03:16:15.858 --> 03:16:20.240]  It takes something that could be pure and it turns into this hijacked protest.
[03:16:20.240 --> 03:16:21.120]  It's really pointless.
[03:16:21.120 --> 03:16:24.862]  The caller said people are showing up, they're harassing people.
[03:16:24.862 --> 03:16:27.103]  That takes away from what's really going on.
[03:16:27.103 --> 03:16:40.368]  And my advice to you right now, if you're going to go to this event tomorrow, sir, is to just be careful as to what you say, in a sense, because they're all filming and you don't want to be that next guy that they try to post up everywhere in a completely ruined... Don't edit you.
[03:16:40.368 --> 03:16:41.889]  They'll make you look totally insane.
[03:16:41.889 --> 03:16:44.250]  The good news is... Hold your ground but just don't...
[03:16:44.870 --> 03:16:46.451]  Don't lose your cool or your temper.
[03:16:46.451 --> 03:16:48.092]  Yeah, they will try to egg you on.
[03:16:48.092 --> 03:16:49.753]  No, no, I don't want to do that.
[03:16:49.753 --> 03:16:53.274]  I mean, these people, I mean, they told them not to come to the Mall of America.
[03:16:53.274 --> 03:16:54.535]  What do they do?
[03:16:54.535 --> 03:16:55.876]  They come to the Mall of America.
[03:16:55.876 --> 03:16:56.916]  Wow, congratulations.
[03:16:56.916 --> 03:17:00.198]  You crashed a diner in some mall.
[03:17:00.198 --> 03:17:03.079]  You know, I mean, that's such an absurd form of protest.
[03:17:03.079 --> 03:17:07.442]  But the good news is all my black friends, and I'd like to hear your take, Jason and Joe.
[03:17:07.442 --> 03:17:13.685]  All my black friends are legitimately concerned about real things and know that these Black Lives Matter people are just completely artificial.
[03:17:15.262 --> 03:17:17.704]  Oh, you're absolutely right.
[03:17:17.704 --> 03:17:20.707]  I mean, I got a friend that's gonna pick me up in an hour to bring me to work.
[03:17:20.707 --> 03:17:21.828]  He's black.
[03:17:21.828 --> 03:17:24.390]  He's totally... Hey, listen to Alex Jones.
[03:17:24.390 --> 03:17:25.671]  He's all about freedom.
[03:17:25.671 --> 03:17:26.772]  There's no color barrier.
[03:17:26.772 --> 03:17:29.074]  But we're racist right now for mentioning that we have black friends.
[03:17:29.074 --> 03:17:30.735]  Jason, here's how they're winning, though.
[03:17:30.735 --> 03:17:32.336]  We have to make that differentiation.
[03:17:32.336 --> 03:17:33.517]  My friend's coming to pick me up.
[03:17:33.517 --> 03:17:34.078]  He's black.
[03:17:34.438 --> 03:17:35.739]  We wouldn't even have to talk about that!
[03:18:04.258 --> 03:18:05.438]  Chuck, would you agree?
[03:18:05.438 --> 03:18:06.018]  Oh, of course.
[03:18:06.018 --> 03:18:09.179]  I mean, like I said, I've got a lot of my friends in Charlotte right now.
[03:18:09.179 --> 03:18:16.880]  There was a cop in 2013, I believe it was, stopped to help a young man, shot and killed him.
[03:18:16.880 --> 03:18:22.561]  There was a mistrial last week, and then North Carolina just came out and said that they're not going to hold another trial on this officer.
[03:18:22.561 --> 03:18:24.122]  He essentially is going to be let go.
[03:18:24.122 --> 03:18:25.322]  So people have taken to the streets.
[03:18:25.322 --> 03:18:26.162]  That's a good reason.
[03:18:26.162 --> 03:18:27.522]  Go out and protest that.
[03:18:27.522 --> 03:18:30.743]  You stop, you ask for a cop to help you, and you get murdered.
[03:18:31.684 --> 03:18:34.126]  That's a reason to go out and protest.
[03:18:34.126 --> 03:18:36.067]  That's what protesting is for.
[03:18:36.067 --> 03:18:45.713]  But then when you go out and you start stopping traffic, or there's a pregnant person out there, there's a miscarriage that happens because of that, now this is turning into something bad.
[03:18:45.713 --> 03:18:53.998]  It was just like when I was in Cincinnati, I believe, the Black Lives Matter protesters were out there outside of the stadium during the NBA playoffs.
[03:18:53.998 --> 03:18:57.460]  And they threw a chair through a window and then started pepper spraying people.
[03:18:57.460 --> 03:18:58.781]  How does that help your cause?
[03:19:00.346 --> 03:19:02.888]  All it does is obviously show the true intentions.
[03:19:02.888 --> 03:19:04.730]  Jason, thanks so much for your call.
[03:19:04.730 --> 03:19:09.574]  Let's go to Barbara on a similar subject on money.
[03:19:09.574 --> 03:19:10.875]  She wants to talk about a number of things.
[03:19:10.875 --> 03:19:13.497]  Barbara, how's it going?
[03:19:13.497 --> 03:19:15.559]  I'm doing well, thank you very much.
[03:19:16.149 --> 03:19:16.429]  Awesome.
[03:19:16.429 --> 03:19:18.010]  Well let's summarize your point real quick.
[03:19:18.010 --> 03:19:20.332]  We're about to go to break and then we'll talk as soon as we get back.
[03:19:20.332 --> 03:19:21.973]  So tell us what's going on.
[03:19:21.973 --> 03:19:28.297]  I have a solution for the Black Lives Matter and racist remarks and things.
[03:19:28.297 --> 03:19:34.862]  And then I wanted to mention that people should make sure that they shouldn't have old money in their possession.
[03:19:34.862 --> 03:19:37.684]  Because we never know when they're going to take it off of the market.
[03:19:39.364 --> 03:19:40.345]  Well, absolutely.
[03:19:40.345 --> 03:19:43.869]  You should have hard assets, you should have real estate, whatever you possibly can.
[03:19:43.869 --> 03:19:45.651]  We will be back in just a few minutes.
[03:19:45.651 --> 03:19:53.160]  We're going to talk about the Pope coming and aligning with Obama, EPA rulings, different power grabs going on, and much, much more.
[03:19:53.160 --> 03:19:54.021]  Stay tuned.
[03:19:54.021 --> 03:19:56.324]  Thank you for watching and listening to the Alex Jones Show.

[03:20:02.419 --> 03:20:04.902]  But where do you go when there's nowhere to go?

[03:20:34.540 --> 03:20:40.406]  Then I go, duh, Garland, Texas, Mohammed cartoon shooting, ISIS is already here.
[03:20:40.406 --> 03:20:42.548]  I'm not waiting for these people to defend me.
[03:20:42.548 --> 03:20:46.953]  If they don't know ISIS is here already, they got no clue, I'm taking care of myself.

[03:23:03.362 --> 03:23:05.405]  Hey neighbor, what are you doing digging?
[03:23:05.405 --> 03:23:07.127]  You had a heart attack last year.
[03:23:07.127 --> 03:23:08.610]  Oh, I know.
[03:23:08.610 --> 03:23:10.532]  I was told no more hard labor.
[03:23:10.532 --> 03:23:12.115]  Then why are you digging?
[03:23:12.115 --> 03:23:13.957]  Well, I've been taking extendovite.
[03:23:13.957 --> 03:23:15.720]  It's been approved to help my heart.
[03:23:15.720 --> 03:23:16.761]  Extendovite?
[03:23:16.761 --> 03:23:17.642]  Is that a new drug?
[03:23:18.482 --> 03:23:19.844]  No, not a drug.
[03:23:19.844 --> 03:23:23.669]  It's more like an herbal combination made from garlic and cayenne.
[03:23:23.669 --> 03:23:24.310]  Herbal?
[03:23:24.310 --> 03:23:25.832]  How can that help?
[03:23:25.832 --> 03:23:30.398]  Well, actually, we've taken herbs for thousands of years, and Xtendivite is doing the job for me.
[03:23:30.398 --> 03:23:33.021]  Does your doctor know about Xtendivite?
[03:23:33.021 --> 03:23:36.626]  Yeah, my doctor knows, and he said it seems to be working for you, so don't stop taking it.
[03:23:36.886 --> 03:23:38.648]  I feel great taking ExtendoVite.
[03:23:38.648 --> 03:23:39.809]  I don't want to stop.

[03:24:13.743 --> 03:24:15.585]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:24:15.585 --> 03:24:19.529]  I'm Anthony Gucciardi sitting in for Alex Jones with Joe Biggs.
[03:24:19.529 --> 03:24:20.971]  We're talking about a number of topics.
[03:24:20.971 --> 03:24:24.755]  We're going to take more calls throughout this final hour of the show.
[03:24:24.755 --> 03:24:29.841]  We're going to talk about how this day trader made $34 million while the economy was collapsing.
[03:24:29.841 --> 03:24:32.343]  We're going to talk about the Pope aligning with Obama.
[03:24:32.904 --> 03:24:34.085]  And what that means.
[03:24:34.085 --> 03:24:42.611]  We're going to talk a little bit more about Black Lives Matter, some things that are going on throughout this weekend, and the Financial Times calling for the abolishment of cash.
[03:24:42.611 --> 03:24:46.413]  We're talking to Barbara, a caller, and she was talking about holding hard assets.
[03:24:46.413 --> 03:24:48.094]  I want to let her finish.
[03:24:48.094 --> 03:24:50.276]  And I want to precurse that with a statement that
[03:24:50.996 --> 03:25:02.302]  In all of these collapse scenarios, and I want to talk about the abolishment of cash and what that would mean for us and what that would mean for the wealthy elite, it's always the case that someone is making cash.
[03:25:02.302 --> 03:25:04.323]  Someone is making money big time.
[03:25:04.323 --> 03:25:08.525]  And I believe there is a secretive way with the abolishment of cash that would
[03:25:09.005 --> 03:25:16.806]  As Alex was talking about earlier, fix the issue where we were saying the banks are laundering so much cash, they're running the drugs, how could they make money if cash was abolished?
[03:25:16.806 --> 03:25:19.527]  I have an idea that I want to throw out on that.
[03:25:19.527 --> 03:25:23.288]  But Barbara, finishing up, you were talking about an economic collapse.
[03:25:23.288 --> 03:25:23.928]  What were you saying?
[03:25:23.928 --> 03:25:35.110]  Okay, what I came to think about was once when a friend of mine, a friend and I went to Cancun.
[03:25:35.791 --> 03:25:47.253]  She brought back some of their colorful dollars, and they had said she couldn't cash it in because that money was already taken off of the market.
[03:25:47.253 --> 03:25:55.935]  Then, you know, I had a little bit of money stored, and I went to look, and a lot of the bills didn't have the color on them.
[03:25:55.935 --> 03:26:04.877]  So if they were going to really upset people, that could be one of the scenarios that they pulled, that automatically they say,
[03:26:05.416 --> 03:26:10.318]  That the money without the color is not any good anymore.
[03:26:10.318 --> 03:26:11.498]  I get what you're saying.
[03:26:11.498 --> 03:26:17.980]  So they can change the standard of the dollar bill and then say everyone with the old dollar bill is no longer allowed to use that cash.
[03:26:17.980 --> 03:26:19.400]  That's an interesting concept.
[03:26:19.400 --> 03:26:21.581]  I had definitely not heard of that before.
[03:26:21.581 --> 03:26:24.202]  Barbara, thank you for your call.
[03:26:24.202 --> 03:26:25.082]  Let's go to Gary in Phoenix.
[03:26:25.082 --> 03:26:25.762]  What's going on, Gary?
[03:26:31.408 --> 03:26:32.868]  Hey, how's it going guys?
[03:26:32.868 --> 03:26:37.670]  You might know me better as Xtremental on Facebook and such.
[03:26:37.670 --> 03:26:38.911]  Awesome man, what's on your mind?
[03:26:38.911 --> 03:26:40.611]  Long time listener.
[03:26:40.611 --> 03:26:42.792]  Two quick points, the GMO battle.
[03:26:42.792 --> 03:26:50.855]  You know, this is just showing that the little guy does have a voice and that we just need to keep on the pressure.
[03:26:50.855 --> 03:26:57.777]  I mean, a lot of these movements, you know, with Oregon, you know, getting rid of GMOs, it's because of the little guy.
[03:26:58.735 --> 03:26:59.316]  No, that's right.
[03:26:59.316 --> 03:27:02.700]  Small acts multiplied by millions can change the world.
[03:27:02.700 --> 03:27:03.521]  Well, it's interesting.
[03:27:03.521 --> 03:27:07.445]  As a child, I remember my father, you know, hey man, you want to go to Burger King?
[03:27:07.445 --> 03:27:09.227]  You want to get like a sausage biscuit or something like that?
[03:27:09.227 --> 03:27:15.755]  And you would drive by and you would see Burger King completely full, the parking lot, McDonald's completely full, people waiting around the line.
[03:27:15.755 --> 03:27:19.018]  Now it looks like a ghost parking lot where there's nothing going on.
[03:27:19.699 --> 03:27:22.300]  That is the most amazing thing in the world.
[03:27:22.300 --> 03:27:26.322]  You know, what was it back during South by Southwest, I dressed up as Donald McRonald.
[03:27:26.322 --> 03:27:28.963]  Oh yeah, we got kicked out of McDonald's together.
[03:27:28.963 --> 03:27:36.786]  And we talked to some people, and people were like, yeah, I eat here anyways, but I always feel like crap the next day, or I currently don't feel good right now, but I'm still gonna go in anyways.
[03:27:37.806 --> 03:27:39.227]  That's what I don't understand.
[03:27:39.227 --> 03:27:41.589]  Why would you purposely hurt yourself?
[03:27:41.589 --> 03:27:47.374]  But the great thing is, though, is like you said, a lot of these people are standing up, a lot of these marches going on, people are standing up against GMO.
[03:27:47.374 --> 03:27:48.535]  They're saying, you know what?
[03:27:48.535 --> 03:27:48.935]  I'm done.
[03:27:48.935 --> 03:27:51.157]  And people are speaking with their dollars.
[03:27:51.157 --> 03:27:53.599]  It is awesome to see these guys get shut down.
[03:27:54.039 --> 03:27:56.682]  Voting with your dollar is my favorite way of activism.
[03:27:56.682 --> 03:27:57.883]  I think it really, really works.
[03:27:57.883 --> 03:28:01.628]  And it reminds me, you know, he brought up Donald, uh, Ron, whatever it was.
[03:28:01.628 --> 03:28:02.088]  Ronald.
[03:28:02.088 --> 03:28:03.590]  It's a puzzle in my mind.
[03:28:03.590 --> 03:28:06.473]  And how he went to McDonald's, I remember getting kicked out.
[03:28:06.473 --> 03:28:12.260]  I mean, the security guard literally dragged me out, pushed me out because I said, what is in your McNuggets?
[03:28:12.800 --> 03:28:16.563]  I went into the line, into the... Well, there's silicone breast implant fillers inside there.
[03:28:16.563 --> 03:28:17.604]  Of course, well I know what's in it.
[03:28:17.604 --> 03:28:19.085]  I wanted to see if they knew what's in it.
[03:28:19.085 --> 03:28:22.627]  I wasn't even actually on, I wasn't like being, I wasn't on the camera piece.
[03:28:22.627 --> 03:28:23.968]  I was like, hey, what's in your McNuggets?
[03:28:23.968 --> 03:28:26.330]  And they was like, oh, oh my God, oh my God.
[03:28:26.330 --> 03:28:28.051]  And they got the security and goes, you need to leave.
[03:28:28.051 --> 03:28:29.032]  And pushed me out of there.
[03:28:29.412 --> 03:28:34.035]  That's why we came back with you in costume, and we asked them, hey, what's going on?
[03:28:34.035 --> 03:28:34.776]  Do you know what's in your food?
[03:28:34.776 --> 03:28:37.178]  And everyone we asked was like, yeah, we know what's in our food.
[03:28:37.178 --> 03:28:38.399]  We know it's GMOs.
[03:28:38.399 --> 03:28:39.860]  We know it's toxic compounds.
[03:28:39.860 --> 03:28:41.281]  We know it's silicon fillers.
[03:28:41.281 --> 03:28:42.702]  We know it's total junk.
[03:28:42.702 --> 03:28:43.622]  But, you know, that's fine.
[03:28:43.622 --> 03:28:44.063]  We don't care.
[03:28:44.063 --> 03:28:44.363]  It tastes good.
[03:28:44.363 --> 03:28:45.684]  But there's still people out there who don't know that.
[03:28:46.104 --> 03:28:46.685]  And that's fine.
[03:28:46.685 --> 03:28:52.970]  If you make a conscious decision to make that choice and put that in your body, by all means, you have that freedom to do so.
[03:28:52.970 --> 03:28:56.472]  But our job is to try to at least waken up the people who don't know that.
[03:28:56.472 --> 03:28:58.494]  And maybe they aren't comfortable with that.
[03:28:58.494 --> 03:29:00.115]  And that's kind of why they're feeling bad.
[03:29:00.115 --> 03:29:02.537]  And they see that and they're like, well, maybe that's why I don't feel good after I eat this.
[03:29:02.537 --> 03:29:03.638]  Maybe I need to make a change.
[03:29:03.638 --> 03:29:04.178]  Yeah, that's true.
[03:29:04.178 --> 03:29:05.319]  The ones I've talked to seem to know.
[03:29:05.319 --> 03:29:08.622]  But every single person you ask, they're like, oh, I have no idea what you're talking about.
[03:29:08.622 --> 03:29:09.082]  I don't care.
[03:29:09.082 --> 03:29:09.843]  I love McDonald's.
[03:29:10.243 --> 03:29:13.366]  Some of them, though, actually were freaked out and said, I'm not eating this ever again.
[03:29:13.366 --> 03:29:18.410]  Because once people realize the truth of what's really going on with their food, they do stop eating it.
[03:29:18.410 --> 03:29:19.491]  It actually does work.
[03:29:19.491 --> 03:29:21.052]  Activism does work.
[03:29:21.052 --> 03:29:22.293]  And Gary, I agree with you.
[03:29:22.293 --> 03:29:28.058]  We're making tangible, real results that matter, and we're defunding them with our dollar.
[03:29:28.058 --> 03:29:32.101]  And coming up, we're going to talk about some other ways we're beating GMOs, Monsanto.
[03:29:32.101 --> 03:29:36.825]  We are going to get into the Pope thing, and we're going to talk about some action that you can take and some real solutions.
[03:29:37.125 --> 03:29:39.026]  Thanks again for watching the Alex Jones Show.
[03:29:39.026 --> 03:29:40.427]  I'm Anthony Gucciardi with Joe Biggs.
[03:29:40.427 --> 03:29:47.971]  We'll be right back.
[03:29:47.971 --> 03:29:49.372]  We're on the march.
[03:29:49.372 --> 03:29:51.913]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:51.913 --> 03:29:59.477]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:29:59.477 --> 03:30:03.059]  Okay, honey, I have to ask, and be honest here.
[03:30:03.059 --> 03:30:04.360]  Have you been taking a little blue pill?
[03:30:06.442 --> 03:30:08.364]  You've been pretty good in the bedroom lately.
[03:30:08.364 --> 03:30:09.945]  No, I swear.
[03:30:09.945 --> 03:30:13.789]  You didn't pick anything up at the Pharmacia last month in Cancun?
[03:30:13.789 --> 03:30:14.549]  No.
[03:30:14.549 --> 03:30:16.331]  Well, something's different.
[03:30:16.331 --> 03:30:19.314]  I have been taking that heart and body extract you bought me.
[03:30:19.314 --> 03:30:21.716]  But that's for your heart and to control your cholesterol.
[03:30:21.716 --> 03:30:25.219]  Well, I read HB extract also promotes healthy prostate function.
[03:30:25.219 --> 03:30:29.062]  I never guessed it would work this well, but... But, you're glad it did.
[03:30:29.062 --> 03:30:29.663]  Oh, yeah.
[03:30:30.043 --> 03:30:42.091]  Heart and Body Extract is a 100% organic formula that promotes a strong heart, healthy arterial flow, better circulation, improves erectile and prostate gland function, and provides youthful energy, strength, and stamina.
[03:30:42.091 --> 03:30:44.633]  Find out more at heartandbodyextract.com.
[03:30:44.633 --> 03:30:48.855]  Heart and Body Extract paired with Healthy Heart Choices is a winning combination.

[03:30:59.364 --> 03:31:06.566]  For all of recorded history, civilizations around the world praised the health benefits of silver.
[03:31:06.566 --> 03:31:16.308]  At InfoWarsLife, our mission is to bring you the highest quality, purest, cleanest, effective colloidal silver on the market today for the lowest price available.

[03:31:47.602 --> 03:31:48.663]  Exclusively available
[03:31:51.144 --> 03:32:02.690]  Friends, this is Alex Jones for MidasResources.com.
[03:32:02.690 --> 03:32:08.273]  For more than 15 years I have exclusively used Midas Resources for all my precious metal needs.
[03:32:08.273 --> 03:32:13.896]  Whether it's bullion or collectibles you're looking for, Midas Resources is simply the best.
[03:32:13.896 --> 03:32:15.957]  I own my gold as a hedge against inflation.
[03:32:16.477 --> 03:32:22.822]  This Federal Reserve fiat currency could go the way of the Deutsche Mark and the Weimar Republic anytime.
[03:32:22.822 --> 03:32:27.685]  In these historically dangerous times, it makes sense to physically hold gold and silver.
[03:32:27.685 --> 03:32:30.567]  Midas already has some of the best deals in the industry.
[03:32:30.567 --> 03:32:36.152]  But if you give them a call and mention the radio special, they will give you a list of the day's super specials.
[03:32:36.152 --> 03:32:39.474]  Midas brokers are standing by to answer all your questions at 800-686-2237.
[03:32:42.356 --> 03:32:48.800]  They also have a lot of informative free literature explaining the opportunities and risk of holding precious metals.
[03:32:48.800 --> 03:32:50.722]  They are ready to answer your questions at 800-686-2237.
[03:32:50.722 --> 03:32:51.082]  Again, that's 800-686-2237.
[03:33:20.561 --> 03:33:25.122]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:33:25.122 --> 03:33:31.604]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:33:31.604 --> 03:33:33.344]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:33.344 --> 03:33:43.107]  I'm Anthony Gucciardi sitting in as we lead in to this long segment of the hour with some motley crew to get everyone upset about this new breaking headline.
[03:33:43.107 --> 03:33:45.748]  Court overturns ruling against NSA.
[03:33:45.748 --> 03:33:46.488]  This is from The Hill.
[03:33:47.248 --> 03:33:55.315]  A federal appeals court on Friday overturned a lower court ruling against the NSA controversial collection method.
[03:33:55.315 --> 03:34:02.062]  So they're saying it's totally fine that the NSA collects every single thing that you do, and you can't do anything about it.
[03:34:02.062 --> 03:34:03.903]  Because, Joe, that's what freedom is all about.
[03:34:03.903 --> 03:34:11.270]  Collecting everything you do, even though you've done nothing wrong, and storing it in massive databases, which, by the way, I personally went to and was kicked out of.
[03:34:11.270 --> 03:34:11.750]  Remember that?
[03:34:11.750 --> 03:34:12.051]  Yeah.
[03:34:12.771 --> 03:34:16.634]  We went to the NSA because... How long ago was that?
[03:34:16.634 --> 03:34:27.080]  About two years ago, up there in Utah, near Park City area, and we went up to the NSA data center and I had a simple request.
[03:34:27.080 --> 03:34:29.322]  I wanted to know some ID.
[03:34:29.322 --> 03:34:31.683]  I wanted ID from one of the NSA workers there.
[03:34:31.683 --> 03:34:36.186]  I wanted to see their ID and I wanted to look through their phone history and just look at everything they've ever done.
[03:34:36.186 --> 03:34:38.368]  Because that's what they do to me and I get to do that to them too.
[03:34:39.088 --> 03:34:50.033]  Now, my plan was to actually go into the NSA center, park my vehicle, and go up and ask them for their information and just kind of talk to them and say, hey, why can't I look at your internet browsing history?
[03:34:50.033 --> 03:34:51.154]  I want to check that out.
[03:34:51.154 --> 03:35:06.862]  But I actually didn't get even farther than the parking lot because a bunch of NSA security trooper people next to the military base that it's on swarmed out in their huge Chevys with a dog that is trained to murder people, a massive German Shepherd.
[03:35:07.762 --> 03:35:22.854]  And I was told that I was lucky the dog wasn't hungry that day because he was going to bite my testicles off and I was totally escorted off and I was arrested by these NSA agents under what authority I'm not sure and told that if I ever come back I'm going to military prison.
[03:35:23.715 --> 03:35:25.235]  So that was not very friendly of them.
[03:35:25.235 --> 03:35:28.196]  That was not a very friendly encounter.
[03:35:28.196 --> 03:35:29.677]  The article is on screen from Infowars.com.
[03:35:29.677 --> 03:35:31.077]  But they're far good though.
[03:35:31.077 --> 03:35:36.419]  NSA goons threatened reporters with attack dogs and that's exactly what happened.
[03:35:36.419 --> 03:35:44.261]  They said I was lucky the dogs weren't hungry and insinuated that they were going to bite my testicles off, which probably would not have been a very fun experience.
[03:35:44.261 --> 03:35:45.461]  But hey, that's fine.
[03:35:45.461 --> 03:35:46.601]  That's fine.
[03:35:46.601 --> 03:35:48.282]  The federal appeals court said that's great.
[03:35:48.282 --> 03:35:48.782]  They're awesome.
[03:35:49.442 --> 03:35:50.783]  We're showing the video on screen right now.
[03:35:50.783 --> 03:35:52.484]  They're there for your protection though.
[03:35:52.484 --> 03:35:54.385]  They're there for my protection.
[03:35:54.385 --> 03:35:56.707]  I forgot to mention the key point.
[03:35:56.707 --> 03:36:05.392]  They took our cameras away and started to rip out the cards, the memory cards, SD cards, ripped them out.
[03:36:05.392 --> 03:36:10.175]  But thankfully we were able to capture the footage, but that's totally illegal.
[03:36:10.175 --> 03:36:15.278]  Let's talk about this Pope story, then we're going to get back to the calls because I kept saying I would cover it.
[03:36:15.278 --> 03:36:16.738]  This is from...
[03:36:18.146 --> 03:36:19.407]  A.P.
[03:36:19.407 --> 03:36:23.732]  Pope shifts to shared goals with Obama as papal visit nears.
[03:36:23.732 --> 03:36:33.161]  Sweeping into office in 2009, President Barack Obama captured near-rockstar status around the world among millions who saw him as the embodiment of a new sense of social purpose.
[03:36:33.161 --> 03:36:34.283]  Oh, how sweet.
[03:36:34.283 --> 03:36:41.430]  Now that baton has largely been passed to Pope Francis, whose visit to the White House next month will put his common cause with Obama
[03:36:41.710 --> 03:36:43.091]  Yeah, that sounds awesome.
[03:36:43.091 --> 03:36:43.812]  I mean, religion, eh?
[03:36:58.925 --> 03:37:00.526]  Hey, that's very Catholic, right?
[03:37:00.526 --> 03:37:02.347]  Steal everything, loot everything, destroy it.
[03:37:02.347 --> 03:37:03.287]  I'm being sarcastic.
[03:37:03.287 --> 03:37:06.329]  Obviously Catholics are real true Catholics are against that.
[03:37:06.329 --> 03:37:07.970]  And I know that very well.
[03:37:07.970 --> 03:37:12.112]  Many people in my family understand that and are true Christians.
[03:37:12.112 --> 03:37:18.276]  Let's go to Adam who wants to talk about the notorious Donald Trump, which is on everyone's mind.
[03:37:18.276 --> 03:37:21.077]  And it seems like we've talked about it, but everyone just wants to keep getting into it.
[03:37:21.077 --> 03:37:23.498]  And I understand why, because it's an attractive subject.
[03:37:23.498 --> 03:37:24.299]  Adam, what's on your mind?
[03:37:26.105 --> 03:37:29.807]  Well, since I've been on hold so long and listening to you guys, I have some other points I could make.
[03:37:29.807 --> 03:37:30.527]  All right, throw them out.
[03:37:30.527 --> 03:37:31.167]  Let's hear them.
[03:37:31.167 --> 03:37:31.867]  Let's do it.
[03:37:31.867 --> 03:37:32.868]  Well, basically, I got two.
[03:37:32.868 --> 03:37:36.149]  I got one for you, Joe, and one for you, Anthony.
[03:37:36.149 --> 03:37:39.610]  The point for you, Joe, is about basically how I feel.
[03:37:39.610 --> 03:37:42.051]  If they take away guns, it's just going to get worse.
[03:37:42.051 --> 03:37:48.254]  Humans as a species are so successful because of how inventive we are and how creative we are.
[03:37:48.254 --> 03:37:53.436]  And if a human has ill will, they're still going to get the job done with the Boston bombing or the
[03:37:55.845 --> 03:37:56.725]  We're good to go.
[03:38:25.464 --> 03:38:46.126]  It's basically I'm in the business of selling rare fruit and I, on an everyday basis, have to kind of keep my feelers out so I am aware of what I'm selling and who's getting it and what they're doing with it because I sell rare seed and I feel like I'm in a special position where I have to be responsible.
[03:38:46.445 --> 03:39:03.817]  Well, that's good that you are responsible because you know most of the seed out there is at risk of being contaminated by GMOs on a major, major scale to the point where organic farms are forced to sue neighboring GMO farms because just the wind can blow the GMO seed into the organic farms.
[03:39:03.817 --> 03:39:12.724]  And it kind of reminds me of a 2007 report about GMO alfalfa where Monsanto had these testing grounds for GMO alfalfa before the USDA approved them.
[03:39:13.604 --> 03:39:18.329]  And the alfalfa was being spread to nearby farms and they didn't think to test for it because why would they?
[03:39:18.329 --> 03:39:27.797]  There's no such thing at this point as approved GMO alfalfa and they were organic barrels and they were tested and they had GMOs inside of them from this GMO alfalfa seed.
[03:39:27.797 --> 03:39:32.282]  So there is a huge risk with GMO contamination that it could spread and it could be out of control.
[03:39:32.802 --> 03:39:38.286]  And I would push to those people that say GMOs are safe, at least, oh, we think they're safe right now.
[03:39:38.286 --> 03:39:43.869]  Well, what about in 100 years if our entire food supply is contaminated with genetically modified organisms?
[03:39:43.869 --> 03:39:44.310]  What then?
[03:39:44.310 --> 03:39:46.371]  We know the risks are untold.
[03:39:46.371 --> 03:39:47.392]  They're truly untold.
[03:39:47.392 --> 03:39:51.274]  And the Roundup alone in the crops is killing people.
[03:39:51.274 --> 03:39:53.876]  And Joe, if you have any comments on that before we go to the next caller.
[03:39:53.876 --> 03:40:00.961]  Well, it always reminds me of that scene from The Matrix when the guy, the Merrill Vingey or whatever, is sitting there and he's eating a steak and he's like, I see the steak.
[03:40:01.661 --> 03:40:02.622]  I smell it.
[03:40:02.622 --> 03:40:03.962]  My brain tells me it's there.
[03:40:03.962 --> 03:40:06.644]  Tastes good, but I know it's not there.
[03:40:06.644 --> 03:40:07.804]  You know, and I think that a lot now.
[03:40:07.804 --> 03:40:13.968]  When I go out and I get vegetables or I get food, I'm sitting there thinking like, is this an actual chicken?
[03:40:13.968 --> 03:40:16.849]  Or is this a chicken that's been beefed up so big on steroids?
[03:40:16.849 --> 03:40:25.034]  Because really, when's the last time we probably actually had a real chicken that's, you know, chickens aren't that big, but now you see them in these farms, see this footage of them, they're giant.
[03:40:25.034 --> 03:40:26.975]  They're like Hulk Hogan's with feathers.
[03:40:27.775 --> 03:40:33.320]  You see these giant large tomatoes that could literally be like a melon of some sort.
[03:40:33.320 --> 03:40:45.771]  And it is funny because I watch movies and they're supposed to be set in like Roman times or even you know the 1600s or something and they have bananas modern-day bananas or they have modern-day oranges and stuff like that.
[03:40:45.771 --> 03:40:55.058]  Our food supply outside of the genetic modification which is a whole another dimension has been selectively bred into this sugar laden weird fruit that actually didn't exist
[03:40:55.939 --> 03:40:57.020]  Hundreds of years ago at all.
[03:40:57.020 --> 03:41:02.822]  I mean, bananas were kind of like short, stubby, brownish type things that weren't nearly as sweet.
[03:41:02.822 --> 03:41:09.005]  Now the idea of a banana is this, like, sweet, super yellow thing that everyone loves.
[03:41:09.005 --> 03:41:10.926]  Our food supply has completely warped.
[03:41:10.926 --> 03:41:13.227]  It's been completely selectively bred.
[03:41:13.227 --> 03:41:17.069]  That's not to say that it's the same as GMO, though, because that just means, you know, it's like a dog.
[03:41:17.069 --> 03:41:20.070]  You get a German Shepherd from breeding certain type of dogs.
[03:41:20.070 --> 03:41:23.192]  You get a Yorkie from another one, a Pit Bull from another one, blah, blah, blah.
[03:41:23.872 --> 03:41:28.574]  As opposed to splicing the gene of a scorpion into the dog, which is genetic modification.
[03:41:28.574 --> 03:41:29.855]  So it's a world of difference.
[03:41:29.855 --> 03:41:34.437]  But our food supply is changed completely, and I call it the new health paradigm versus the old health paradigm.
[03:41:35.151 --> 03:41:42.314]  Let's say pre-1900s is the old paradigm in which an apple is an apple.
[03:41:42.314 --> 03:41:45.635]  You're not going to have pesticides and herbicides killing you when you eat an apple.
[03:41:45.635 --> 03:41:47.776]  You're not going to have genetic modification of any kind.
[03:41:47.776 --> 03:41:51.118]  You're going to have a pretty balanced diet, even if you just eat whatever is out there.
[03:41:51.118 --> 03:41:55.179]  In the new health paradigm, when you go out to the grocery store, an apple is no longer just an apple.
[03:41:55.179 --> 03:41:56.400]  It has a film outside of it.
[03:41:56.400 --> 03:41:58.741]  It has herbicides, pesticides, fungicides, you name it.
[03:41:58.741 --> 03:42:01.262]  It can even be GMO now with the new Arctic apple.
[03:42:01.542 --> 03:42:07.364]  So we're living in a new health paradigm where we don't even know what we're eating unless we super investigate our food.
[03:42:07.364 --> 03:42:10.085]  Let's go to Danny in Texas.
[03:42:10.085 --> 03:42:13.126]  He wants to talk about the economy and a potential economic crash.
[03:42:13.126 --> 03:42:15.966]  What's up, Danny?
[03:42:15.966 --> 03:42:16.727]  Hi, Anthony.
[03:42:16.727 --> 03:42:17.887]  How are you guys doing?
[03:42:17.887 --> 03:42:18.667]  I'm doing great.
[03:42:18.667 --> 03:42:20.388]  Awesome.
[03:42:20.388 --> 03:42:22.889]  Okay, let me get y'all's speaker here.
[03:42:22.889 --> 03:42:23.569]  All right.
[03:42:23.569 --> 03:42:25.069]  So what's on your mind, Danny?
[03:42:25.069 --> 03:42:27.310]  What do you want to talk about about the economic crash?
[03:42:27.310 --> 03:42:30.591]  I took an extra minute there to get y'all's speaker, but I find you read better.
[03:42:31.024 --> 03:42:40.129]  Listen, I've been wanting to try to get in about a book that's written by Jonathan Cahn.
[03:42:40.129 --> 03:42:45.491]  And, you know, on the one hand, I think Alex has probably read it, but I don't know.
[03:42:45.491 --> 03:42:46.932]  And what's in this book?
[03:42:46.932 --> 03:42:48.013]  What's this book about?
[03:42:48.013 --> 03:42:59.939]  It's the name of it's the Harbinger, and it's a it's written in story form by a guy that put together all of the Jewish
[03:43:01.436 --> 03:43:12.843]  Uh, traditions and, and, um, uh, warnings from God, uh, in Isaiah chapter 9, uh, uh, verse 10.
[03:43:12.843 --> 03:43:23.829]  Uh, and what he does is he ties it all together into the, from the fall of Israel, uh, directly, uh, across to 9-11.
[03:43:23.829 --> 03:43:28.011]  And then he, uh, and he states that the reason for this is, uh,
[03:43:29.159 --> 03:43:32.981]  That's interesting.
[03:43:32.981 --> 03:43:43.165]  That's definitely not my area of expertise, but apparently the producers just said that Alex has had this guy that you're, I guess, the author on the Nightly News, and he's talked at length about it.
[03:43:43.165 --> 03:43:44.905]  Joe, if you're familiar with any of this?
[03:43:44.905 --> 03:43:48.087]  No, but I mean, I've heard Leanne talk about the Scimitar thing before.
[03:43:48.087 --> 03:43:50.227]  I think it was a couple months ago.
[03:43:50.227 --> 03:43:54.489]  She did a story in here with a guy about that, but yeah, I'm not really that well versed in that area.
[03:43:54.489 --> 03:43:56.850]  So are you saying there's an economic crash prediction you'd like to make?
[03:43:58.683 --> 03:44:24.545]  Well, yeah, what it comes down to is, he doesn't exactly say this in the book, but the end of this period of seven years, which is what the Shemitah is about, when debts are supposed to be forgiven on the last day of the seventh year, and that's in the Jewish month of Eilat, and that happens to coincide with September.
[03:44:24.545 --> 03:44:26.346]  In fact, September the 29th.
[03:44:27.825 --> 03:44:40.601]  And so, the book itself is an outstanding piece, but it will just blow you away how everything ties into the Bible and Jewish tradition.
[03:44:49.333 --> 03:44:54.836]  I've heard a lot about September, some of the most insane things you could possibly hear and some of the most rational things.
[03:44:54.836 --> 03:44:57.477]  I've heard about asteroids blowing the planet up.
[03:44:57.477 --> 03:44:59.698]  I've heard about bank holidays.
[03:44:59.698 --> 03:45:03.440]  I've heard about insider stock trading that's going on that's going to mess everything up.
[03:45:03.440 --> 03:45:05.081]  I've heard about China collapsing in different ways.
[03:45:06.241 --> 03:45:16.068]  Everything you could possibly imagine about September and October from people that I think are way out there and also people that I think are super sound of mind and super intelligent and know what they're talking about.
[03:45:16.068 --> 03:45:18.470]  So I have no clue really what's going to go on.
[03:45:18.470 --> 03:45:21.493]  All I know is it's important to secure yourself no matter what.
[03:45:21.493 --> 03:45:24.315]  I mean, at the end of the day, are you going to sit around and...
[03:45:25.600 --> 03:45:28.601]  Worry about something that might happen, or just go ahead and start preparing.
[03:45:28.601 --> 03:45:30.242]  Right, I mean, I'm prepared anyway.
[03:45:30.242 --> 03:45:47.789]  Yeah, be prepared, and if something happens, whatever the case may be, an asteroid, whatever it could be, just know that you've got your family together, you've got a plan, you're prepared, you've got food, you've got whatever it could be to get through it, and don't spend all the time sitting there worrying about what it might possibly be, because that takes your focus away.
[03:45:47.789 --> 03:45:51.291]  Get food, store food, you know, water, all that, and just
[03:45:52.091 --> 03:45:52.672]  See what happens.
[03:46:09.225 --> 03:46:10.485]  It's going to happen or it's not.
[03:46:10.485 --> 03:46:12.926]  We're going to die or we're not going to die.
[03:46:12.926 --> 03:46:13.686]  I could die right now.
[03:46:13.686 --> 03:46:14.286]  I could die tomorrow.
[03:46:14.286 --> 03:46:15.386]  I could have a heart attack tomorrow.
[03:46:15.386 --> 03:46:16.626]  You definitely have to enjoy life.
[03:46:16.626 --> 03:46:18.007]  Prepare for what's coming.
[03:46:18.007 --> 03:46:18.727]  Try to see.
[03:46:18.727 --> 03:46:22.047]  Try to do your own research and figure out your take on it.
[03:46:22.047 --> 03:46:25.488]  Alright, let's talk about Matt.
[03:46:25.488 --> 03:46:26.548]  We'll go to Matt in Washington.
[03:46:26.548 --> 03:46:27.268]  Yeah, Matt in Washington.
[03:46:27.268 --> 03:46:29.008]  He wants to talk about Sheriff Ozzie.
[03:46:29.008 --> 03:46:31.529]  What's going on, Matt?
[03:46:31.529 --> 03:46:32.609]  Hey, you guys.
[03:46:32.609 --> 03:46:34.789]  I was up at the rally with Joe and those guys.
[03:46:34.789 --> 03:46:35.970]  We had a real good time.
[03:46:35.970 --> 03:46:38.190]  It's nice to hear you guys on the fourth hour today.
[03:46:39.360 --> 03:46:40.940]  Thanks a lot.
[03:46:40.940 --> 03:46:46.242]  Have you guys seen Ozzy's two-hour presentation on the myth of police militarization?
[03:46:46.242 --> 03:46:49.262]  I actually haven't seen it yet, but I've heard about it.
[03:46:49.262 --> 03:46:52.283]  Tell me more about it.
[03:46:52.283 --> 03:47:01.945]  Well, it's a two-hour presentation he did here back in June, and so I watched most of it, and I hit him up on Facebook, and I said, hey, you know,
[03:47:02.742 --> 03:47:05.507]  Alex Jones wants to debate you.
[03:47:05.507 --> 03:47:06.870]  What are your thoughts on that?
[03:47:06.870 --> 03:47:13.982]  And his response was that Alex Jones doesn't have the courage to debate him and neither did Matt Shea.
[03:47:14.448 --> 03:47:32.983]  Well that's funny because we went up there almost a year ago and specifically to debate this guy, especially after those comments came out from one of their officers about the MRAP being used for constitutionalists and how they stockpile weapons and ammo and how, you know, we're these evil bad people.
[03:47:32.983 --> 03:47:37.526]  And we showed up, there was myself, Darren McBreen, Travis Knight, and
[03:47:39.537 --> 03:47:47.101]  We went out there, we went to confront this guy, and then all of a sudden he goes on this unexpected vacation, tucks his tail between his legs and runs off.
[03:47:47.101 --> 03:47:57.607]  And the whole time we're out there for four or five days, everyone's like there's these Aussie spottings where people saw the sheriff like in civilian attire at a restaurant somewhere ducking and dodging.
[03:47:57.607 --> 03:47:58.307]  That's what he does.
[03:47:58.307 --> 03:48:02.430]  This guy is a puppet for the SPLC.
[03:48:02.430 --> 03:48:05.792]  That's a complete and total dirtbag garbage group anyways.
[03:48:05.792 --> 03:48:07.953]  And I mean, it's almost like having
[03:48:09.401 --> 03:48:16.307]  At the end of the day, Sheriff Ozzie Nezovic should bring in Snopes to investigate the crimes they have in Spokane.
[03:48:16.307 --> 03:48:19.250]  Because, I mean, that's how out of this world this guy is.
[03:48:19.250 --> 03:48:24.394]  Well, I'm sure Alex is cowering in fear and totally unwilling to debate him, right?
[03:48:24.394 --> 03:48:26.195]  I'm pretty sure it's been opened up before.
[03:48:26.195 --> 03:48:29.118]  I think he had the ability to contact the producers of the show.
[03:48:29.598 --> 03:48:32.599]  Yeah, he backed out before.
[03:48:32.599 --> 03:48:35.640]  He's written me on Facebook as well.
[03:48:35.640 --> 03:48:45.682]  The entire Spokane Sheriff's Department has written me as well, saying that they're not afraid that anytime they're willing to debate Alex and the InfoWars crew.
[03:48:45.682 --> 03:48:48.043]  I just see it being another, he's going to tuck his tail and run.
[03:48:48.863 --> 03:48:51.804]  Hey, my question is, I believe wholeheartedly in owning
[03:49:12.396 --> 03:49:13.697]  We're good to go!
[03:49:41.861 --> 03:49:53.809]  So I could give you the perspective based on the economic experts that I've spoken to, and personally I hold physical gold and silver, but the perspective of this is dependent upon how much of a preparedness, you know, lens you want to look through.
[03:49:53.809 --> 03:50:01.014]  I mean, specifically you're buying essentially paper slips that guarantee you to a certain amount of gold and silver in a vault somewhere in the known universe.
[03:50:01.534 --> 03:50:08.002]  So, in a theoretical complete collapse scenario, that piece of paper is not exactly going to get you very far, right?
[03:50:08.002 --> 03:50:14.430]  Also, you also have a 401k system that's built in to last at least several years before you turn that age.
[03:50:14.430 --> 03:50:18.074]  Now, from a balanced perspective, if you're thinking that
[03:50:18.635 --> 03:50:29.308]  The economy obviously, you know, is not going to completely turn over and it's not going to go out within the next several years and you're at a certain age to where you can cash out on your 401k.
[03:50:29.308 --> 03:50:37.277]  That's probably better than holding non-physical cash, holding digits into space, at least a piece of paper guaranteeing you gold and silver.
[03:50:37.277 --> 03:50:38.819]  I invest in guns and ammo.
[03:50:39.059 --> 03:50:44.224]  Yeah, I'm personally a physical investor as well, but there's numerous ways to look at it.
[03:50:44.224 --> 03:50:47.887]  I'm Anthony Gucciardi with Joe Biggs filling in for Alex Jones in this final hour.
[03:50:47.887 --> 03:50:50.589]  We'll be back with the last segment covering some key news.

[03:54:14.850 --> 03:54:17.012]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:54:17.012 --> 03:54:26.019]  In this final segment, we're going to take some more calls, talk about the new breaking news that has come out, and overall, get into some key topics.
[03:54:26.019 --> 03:54:27.840]  So, let's go right into it.
[03:54:27.840 --> 03:54:30.702]  Let's start talking to Richard in Tennessee.
[03:54:30.702 --> 03:54:34.685]  He wants to talk about defunding and some different things about Target.
[03:54:34.685 --> 03:54:37.087]  What's going on, Richard?
[03:54:37.087 --> 03:54:42.891]  Yeah, I was actually mentioning where you guys busted LE Targets, the same website, usaspending.gov.
[03:54:44.668 --> 03:55:09.026]  It shows on there, if you search stratospheric aerosols, a litany of universities and private corporations come up where they're doing different tests, and I just thought that would be some good news to maybe get out there, because they always say that chemtrails aren't real, but here you go, stratospheric aerosols.
[03:55:09.026 --> 03:55:09.767]  So what do you make of that?
[03:55:13.863 --> 03:55:15.591]  It's definitely going on.
[03:55:15.591 --> 03:55:16.093]  Absolutely.
[03:55:16.991 --> 03:55:17.731]  What do you think, Joe?
[03:55:17.731 --> 03:55:20.912]  Chemtrails, I definitely want to hear your question.
[03:55:20.912 --> 03:55:28.395]  Chemtrails, to me, is definitely, it has been pushed to the seedy underbelly of the alternative news world, hasn't it?
[03:55:28.395 --> 03:55:28.995]  Yeah.
[03:55:28.995 --> 03:55:30.896]  It really has been pushed to the seedy underbelly.
[03:55:30.896 --> 03:55:32.857]  And there's a lot of information out there, there really is.
[03:55:32.857 --> 03:55:39.939]  There's a lot of information, there's a lot of disinformation, there is a lot to merit research, there's a lot to merit the seedy underbelly.
[03:55:39.939 --> 03:55:42.080]  It's funny though, as soon as you bring it up, everyone's like, whoa.
[03:55:42.080 --> 03:55:42.600]  You're crazy.
[03:55:42.600 --> 03:55:43.901]  You just went there, oh my god.
[03:55:44.361 --> 03:55:45.842]  It's definitely, it's definitely been pushed.
[03:55:45.842 --> 03:55:48.724]  It's like bringing up religion or politics at a ball.
[03:55:48.724 --> 03:55:50.966]  Yes, it's been pushed to the sea underbelly.
[03:55:50.966 --> 03:55:53.889]  But what were you going to say, Richard?
[03:55:53.889 --> 03:56:07.199]  Well, I live outside of Oak Ridge, and I've seen this in southwest Virginia as well, but I see some drones quite a bit, white aircraft that just move very slowly, some without wings.
[03:56:07.199 --> 03:56:08.380]  You guys ever see anything like this?
[03:56:09.056 --> 03:56:10.717]  I have not seen anything like that.
[03:56:10.717 --> 03:56:11.918]  That's a negative here.
[03:56:11.918 --> 03:56:13.999]  You should take a video of it and put it on YouTube.
[03:56:13.999 --> 03:56:16.120]  Alright, let's go to Brent real quick.
[03:56:16.120 --> 03:56:17.600]  We're going to wrap up the show here.
[03:56:17.600 --> 03:56:19.621]  Brent, what's going on?
[03:56:19.621 --> 03:56:25.224]  Hey guys, thanks for taking my call and I appreciate listening to your excellent investigative journalism.
[03:56:25.224 --> 03:56:35.790]  I just wanted to call today to say that I stumbled across a news article, I believe it was from the Wall Street Journal or Forbes, but basically it just says that on October the 21st,
[03:56:36.929 --> 03:56:37.229]  We're good.
[03:56:53.578 --> 03:56:54.378]  That is interesting.
[03:56:54.378 --> 03:56:56.439]  I'm definitely going to have to look that up.
[03:56:56.439 --> 03:57:06.701]  And it seems like it's almost like the major banking institutions and world currency institutions are feeding into the idea that something crazy is going to happen in October, just because they're making so many actions.
[03:57:06.701 --> 03:57:09.582]  They're doing so many weird things in September and October.
[03:57:09.582 --> 03:57:12.423]  And once again, I'm not sitting here saying anything is going to happen.
[03:57:12.423 --> 03:57:16.824]  It is interesting, though, that all of these movements are happening at one time, pushing together.
[03:57:16.824 --> 03:57:17.964]  Joe Biggs, your take on this?
[03:57:19.306 --> 03:57:21.307]  I mean, I agree with what you just said.
[03:57:21.307 --> 03:57:28.088]  I mean, their actions alone are going to spark people's reactions on the opposite end as well.
[03:57:28.088 --> 03:57:28.929]  Like, alright, they're doing this.
[03:57:28.929 --> 03:57:29.569]  They're begging for it.
[03:57:29.569 --> 03:57:30.649]  So that means something's happening.
[03:57:30.649 --> 03:57:33.370]  That means something's happening and that sends everybody into a panic.
[03:57:33.370 --> 03:57:35.391]  At the end of the day, do I know what's going to happen?
[03:57:35.391 --> 03:57:35.671]  No.
[03:57:35.671 --> 03:57:38.631]  But like I said before to the last caller, I'm going to be prepared.
[03:57:38.631 --> 03:57:39.532]  I've got my guns.
[03:57:39.532 --> 03:57:40.052]  I'm ready to go.
[03:57:41.189 --> 03:57:44.970]  Yeah, you need to get everything in order anyway, which is the key thing.
[03:57:44.970 --> 03:57:48.930]  And in closing, everyone, thank you for watching the Alex Jones Show.
[03:57:48.930 --> 03:57:53.371]  I have filled in as a sub-wing commander for Alex Jones.
[03:57:53.371 --> 03:57:59.432]  I would encourage all of you to check out theinfowarsstore.com to support the show, support Alex, what he does.
[03:57:59.432 --> 03:58:00.313]  He needs the funding.
[03:58:00.313 --> 03:58:04.893]  He is launching many, many surprising, amazing new things in the coming months that he will announce.
[03:58:04.893 --> 03:58:07.074]  And it is your support that makes it all possible.
[03:58:07.694 --> 03:58:12.539]  Thank you so much for tuning in, and as always, the Nightly News is coming up tonight.
[03:58:12.539 --> 03:58:15.321]  What is going to be going on in the Nightly News, Joe?
[03:58:15.321 --> 03:58:23.789]  Leanne's going to be hosting, and I think she's going to have myself and maybe a couple other of us on there and talk about some important topics that she has wrapped up, so we'll see what happens.
[03:58:23.789 --> 03:58:24.329]  Excellent.
[03:58:24.329 --> 03:58:25.811]  Thanks so much for watching.
[03:58:25.811 --> 03:58:26.851]  Appreciate you guys.
