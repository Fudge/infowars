[00:00:12.289 --> 00:00:23.721]  InfoWars caught shocking video of drugs being smuggled across the US-Mexico border, validating highly criticized claims by Donald Trump that illegal immigrants are bringing drugs into the US.
[00:00:24.221 --> 00:00:30.424]  Info Wars reporters Joe Biggs and Josh Owens traveled to Laredo to cover Trump's highly publicized visit.
[00:00:30.624 --> 00:00:37.086]  While they were recording footage of the Rio Grande River, they spotted a group of illegals crossing the river on rafts.
[00:00:37.486 --> 00:00:48.011]  Moments later, we see one of the men nervously holding open the trunk of a red SUV, while four others frantically toss what is almost certainly drugs into the back of the car.
[00:00:48.231 --> 00:00:52.813]  Those men scurry back toward Mexico, while the vehicle speeds off into the U.S.
[00:00:53.493 --> 00:00:58.235]  Mexican drug cartels make up to $29 billion annually from U.S.
[00:00:58.275 --> 00:01:05.077]  drug sales, and this footage shows just how easily that transaction happens due to the porous nature of the border.
[00:01:05.377 --> 00:01:09.799]  Now, while this footage may be shocking to some, it's not at all surprising.
[00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:14.421]  In Texas alone, foreign aliens committed more than 600,000 unique crimes from 2008 to 2014,
[00:01:18.582 --> 00:01:35.010]  But the president has plans for even more amnesty by expanding the number of illegal immigrants allowed to stay in the country, shielding 80% of the nation's illegals from deportation, and he has even threatened to veto a bill that would strip sanctuary cities of federal funding.
[00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:41.375]  The bill aims to deny cities that refuse to enforce federal immigration laws certain Justice Department grants.
[00:01:41.875 --> 00:01:45.638]  The bill is a response to the shooting death of 32-year-old Kate Steinle.
[00:01:45.898 --> 00:01:59.149]  Convicted felon Francisco Sanchez was an illegal immigrant who had already been deported multiple times, but he was free to murder because sanctuary city San Francisco is under no pressure to enforce federal laws.
[00:01:59.449 --> 00:02:05.635]  Listen to the heart-wrenching testimony of Laura Wilkerson, a mother whose son was murdered by an illegal immigrant.
[00:02:06.096 --> 00:02:10.039]  You're officially notified today there's a problem when this happens.
[00:02:11.318 --> 00:02:13.619]  You can't deny it any longer.
[00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:18.262]  You cannot stand by and ignore our families, our American families.
[00:02:18.982 --> 00:02:23.064]  You're elected by Americans, not any other country.
[00:02:23.604 --> 00:02:25.445]  You should be for Americans.
[00:02:26.005 --> 00:02:32.709]  I will not give up control of another one of my children so that a foreign person can have a nicer life.
[00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:36.571]  Sanctuary City policies scream to the criminal element
[00:02:38.092 --> 00:02:38.493]  I think?
