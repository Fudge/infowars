[00:00:11.155 --> 00:00:18.344]  This is for all the people who say the science on vaccines is subtle and if you don't get one, we're going to force you.
[00:00:18.804 --> 00:00:30.278]  This is about a measles outbreak that you haven't heard about, but you need to because it flies in the face of all the statistics and information you're being given by the CDC and the media.
[00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:39.484]  In New York, in 2011, a 22-year-old woman who had been vaccinated twice not only got sick with the measles, but she transmitted it to four other people.
[00:00:39.904 --> 00:00:45.628]  Furthermore, half of the people who caught it from her had been vaccinated twice themselves.
[00:00:46.499 --> 00:00:51.964]  The other half didn't have vaccine records but they had signs in their blood that they had been vaccinated.
[00:00:52.505 --> 00:01:01.573]  Now this woman had 88 contacts and the CDC feverishly searched for all of them and found that no one other than those four had contracted the disease.
[00:01:01.933 --> 00:01:07.638]  In this New York 2011 outbreak, the MMR vaccine didn't provide 99% protection to the vaccinated.
[00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:14.163]  All of the victims of the measles outbreak had been vaccinated.
[00:01:14.503 --> 00:01:23.489]  In this Disney outbreak, the California Department of Health is still saying two doses of measles containing MMR vaccine are more than 99% effective in preventing measles.
[00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:40.558]  Even in this article from Science Magazine, talking about a fully vaccinated patient who transmitted the disease to four other vaccinated patients, they still can't help but repeat the 99% effective line that we're being sold by the CDC and the pharmaceutical industry.
[00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:41.560]  I don't know.
[00:01:56.943 --> 00:02:00.265]  The CDC says that New York has a 90% vaccination rate.
[00:02:00.745 --> 00:02:08.930]  If we go with the CDC average, that would mean that nine people who were exposed to the vaccinated carrier were unvaccinated, yet didn't catch it.
[00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:10.150]  But wait!
[00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:14.853]  The CDC tells us that 90% of unvaccinated people who come in contact with measles will get it.
[00:02:15.553 --> 00:02:19.098]  No unvaccinated people got the measles in this New York outbreak.
[00:02:19.458 --> 00:02:25.666]  So, is the pharmaceutical industry and the CDC, are they overstating the efficacy of the vaccine?
[00:02:26.167 --> 00:02:31.814]  Well, as a matter of fact, two virologists who worked for Merck claimed that they were doing exactly that.
[00:02:32.375 --> 00:02:42.206]  Two virologists who worked for Merck, the largest manufacturer of MMR vaccines, accused the corporation of falsifying tests to overstate the vaccine's efficacy.
[00:02:42.707 --> 00:02:52.058]  They claimed that they witnessed firsthand the improper testing and data falsification that Merck engaged in to artificially inflate the vaccine's efficacy findings.
[00:02:52.418 --> 00:03:01.621]  And they said that that scheme caused the United States government to pay hundreds of millions of dollars for a vaccine that doesn't provide adequate immunization.
[00:03:02.101 --> 00:03:05.422]  So, are Big Pharma and the CDC lying to people?
[00:03:05.462 --> 00:03:07.322]  Are they overstating the efficacy of the vaccine?
[00:03:07.602 --> 00:03:12.904]  Are they telling you that you're protected, 99% protected, when in fact you aren't?
[00:03:13.737 --> 00:03:32.502]  They allege that Merck added animal antibodies to blood samples to achieve more favorable test results, although they knew that the human immune system would never produce such antibodies, and that the antibodies created a laboratory testing scenario that, quote, did not in any way correspond to, correlate with, or represent real life.
[00:03:32.802 --> 00:03:34.742]  So the FDA didn't look into this matter?
[00:03:34.782 --> 00:03:36.203]  They were satisfied with Merck's answer?
[00:03:37.123 --> 00:03:43.185]  Are we surprised that regulatory agencies and the government would be captured by those that they're supposed to watch?
[00:03:43.385 --> 00:03:45.685]  Of course, the DOJ did not look at it either.
[00:03:46.445 --> 00:03:48.786]  They haven't looked at quite a few things lately, have they?
[00:03:49.266 --> 00:03:59.289]  When the CDC buys $4 billion worth of vaccines in 2014 alone, and then sells these as well, does that kind of conflict of interest bother you?
[00:04:00.287 --> 00:04:06.171]  But it's not just this measles outbreak in 2011 in New York that the media doesn't want to talk about, strangely.
[00:04:06.651 --> 00:04:09.413]  There's another epidemic they don't want to talk about either.
[00:04:10.094 --> 00:04:10.314]  Autism.
[00:04:10.334 --> 00:04:12.656]  In the 1970s and 1980s, only about 1 out of every 2,000 children had autism.
[00:04:12.676 --> 00:04:13.516]  Last year, it was 1 in 68.
[00:04:13.556 --> 00:04:14.217]  That's a 2,900% increase.
[00:04:23.283 --> 00:04:26.348]  A 30% increase in just the last two years.
[00:04:26.628 --> 00:04:28.611]  Correlation is not causation.
[00:04:29.052 --> 00:04:36.323]  But there is a very strong correlation to the increased use of vaccines and the rise of autism.
[00:04:36.912 --> 00:04:50.855]  And if you look at autism in the Amish community, where they don't vaccinate, as one reporter did ten years ago when the national rate at that time was just 1 in 150, in the Amish community there were only three children with autism.
[00:04:51.335 --> 00:04:56.836]  One of those three children was a child that was adopted from China and had received all of her vaccinations in one day.
[00:04:57.316 --> 00:05:06.358]  The second child was perfectly normal before getting the vaccine, but exhibited autism symptoms immediately after vaccination, and of course the autism has never gone away.
[00:05:06.798 --> 00:05:09.439]  There was no information about the third child and vaccines.
[00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:23.243]  On the other hand, the highest rate of autism in the country is in Utah, where the Mormon Church leadership has actively partnered with Bill Gates to vaccinate hundreds of thousands both domestically and abroad.
[00:05:23.863 --> 00:05:33.549]  So we have two communities, one where vaccines are essentially shunned, and we see that autism is so rare that it's virtually non-existent, as it used to be in the United States.
[00:05:34.229 --> 00:05:42.734]  But another community, where it is actively pushed by the leadership, we see that they have an even higher rate than the exploding autism rate in this country.
[00:05:43.455 --> 00:05:44.656]  And we have two outbreaks.
[00:05:45.536 --> 00:05:56.878]  One that exposes the ineffectiveness of vaccines is ignored by the media, while another one is used to blame the unvaccinated persons who catch it for the ineffectiveness of the vaccine.
[00:05:58.024 --> 00:06:01.767]  Look at the hatred and the scapegoating that's being promoted by the media.
[00:06:02.347 --> 00:06:06.310]  Forbes says measles can kill and we should sue parents who don't vaccinate.
[00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:11.994]  And on the left, Slate says parents who don't vaccinate their kids should not only be sued, but criminally charged.
[00:06:12.394 --> 00:06:18.459]  The New York Times calls the outbreak unnecessary and says that opposition to vaccines is lunacy.
[00:06:19.099 --> 00:06:24.720]  And we're told that the anti-vaccine movement caused this Mickey Mouse measles outbreak, and it was the worst in 20 years.
[00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:29.921]  Well, you know, about 25 years ago, approximately 18,000 people were getting the measles each year.
[00:06:30.021 --> 00:06:33.002]  Yes, it can kill, but it's extremely rare.
[00:06:33.442 --> 00:06:39.943]  In the 1960s, before the measles vaccine, there were about 4 million measles cases each year, with about 400 deaths.
[00:06:40.363 --> 00:06:44.964]  Those deaths are a tragedy, but how many diseases have a 99.99% chance you won't die?
[00:06:47.805 --> 00:06:58.197]  Now, after 25 years of vaccines, the mortality rate increased by 10 to 20 times, but it was still less than half the number of deaths from insect bites and stings.
[00:06:58.598 --> 00:07:07.368]  With such a low mortality rate, why would this justify a medical tyranny of forced injections without consent, without information about the risks?
[00:07:08.188 --> 00:07:18.541]  The pharmaceutical industry that owns the media, that funds them with their continuous commercials, are pushing vaccines everywhere for every kind of condition, and now they want to make them mandatory.
[00:07:19.201 --> 00:07:27.431]  Just as people wanted health care, and we got mandatory insurance, that isn't necessarily going to pay for your health care, but you're going to get it at an inflated rate.
[00:07:28.172 --> 00:07:47.127]  Understand that if you accept this mandatory vaccination without your informed consent, that when we do have a life-threatening disease, and measles is not it, but when we do have something like Ebola come to this country, they are going to be pushing a vaccine on you, and you're going to be the human guinea pig.
[00:07:47.588 --> 00:07:50.570]  And they're not even going to pretend that they've tested it.
[00:07:51.131 --> 00:07:56.215]  But they will make billions of dollars selling it to the government that forces you to take it.
[00:07:56.755 --> 00:07:58.706]  For InfoWars Nightly News, I'm David Knight.
[00:08:07.867 --> 00:08:13.672]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries in the area of health.
