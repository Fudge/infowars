[00:00:08.567 --> 00:00:11.450]  This is Jakari Jackson for InfoWars.com.
[00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:17.215]  You guys have probably seen the clip by now of the racist rant by an OU fraternity from Oklahoma.
[00:00:17.535 --> 00:00:23.601]  I would show you the video, but YouTube likes to pick on us and strike us down for posting stuff that's already on YouTube.
[00:00:23.881 --> 00:00:26.184]  But we'll put a link in the description below.
[00:00:26.804 --> 00:00:35.568]  And the reason I'm talking about this is because I'd like to applaud the president of Oklahoma University because he came out and he said, we don't appreciate these racist rants.
[00:00:35.908 --> 00:00:37.709]  These are the actions of these individuals.
[00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:40.190]  We do not support or condone those individuals.
[00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:44.131]  And then he went a step further to shut down the fraternity.
[00:00:44.431 --> 00:00:50.354]  It seems like the president of a state university is more on the ball than our president of the United States.
[00:00:50.734 --> 00:00:56.959]  Because we see President Obama, he says, I don't support this, I don't support that, but then he doesn't really do too much about it.
[00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:59.921]  Example, Fast and Furious running guns into Mexico.
[00:01:00.961 --> 00:01:04.804]  Listen to what Holder told a Judiciary Committee hearing on May 3rd this year.
[00:01:05.325 --> 00:01:09.828]  I'm not sure of the exact date, but I probably heard about Fast and Furious for the first time over the last few weeks.
[00:01:10.339 --> 00:01:19.252]  Yet internal Justice Department documents show that at least 10 months before that hearing, Holder began receiving frequent memos discussing Fast and Furious.
[00:01:19.712 --> 00:01:24.760]  They came from the head of the National Drug Intelligence Center and Assistant Attorney General Lanny Brewer.
[00:01:26.325 --> 00:01:36.974]  Well, I didn't really know too much about this, I don't support this, but I'll give the Justice Department the authorization to investigate themselves and then come up with whatever decision they find necessary.
[00:01:37.215 --> 00:01:46.523]  Or he says, I don't support the things that happened in Benghazi, even though we know that Ambassador Stevens was sending his communications to Mrs. Clinton months before he was murdered.
[00:01:47.003 --> 00:01:49.005]  Or Lois Lerner at the IRS.
[00:01:49.385 --> 00:01:51.106]  Well, you know, I don't know about this.
[00:01:51.166 --> 00:01:52.988]  I found out about this stuff on the news.
[00:01:53.288 --> 00:01:59.132]  And then Mrs. Lerner goes up into her testimony and she just sticks her nose up in the air and she doesn't have too much to say.
[00:01:59.492 --> 00:02:07.058]  So even though the President of the United States doesn't condone these things when he gets up there and speaks, he doesn't do anything to stop them even after the fact.
[00:02:07.498 --> 00:02:15.866]  So it seems like to me, Mr. Obama needs to enroll in a course at the University of Oklahoma where he can actually learn some responsibility and leadership skills.
