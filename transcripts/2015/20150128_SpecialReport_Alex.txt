[00:00:12.588 --> 00:00:18.675]  I've been to several press conferences, and oftentimes they will tell you what they want you to hear, not so much what you want to know.
[00:00:19.035 --> 00:00:27.365]  This could be as simple as just handing you a press release, these are the only topics that we want to talk about, or a politician abruptly leaving the stage after their speech has concluded.
[00:00:27.385 --> 00:00:32.271]  So I'm very curious why a governor in Indiana feels the need for his own media outlet.
[00:00:32.691 --> 00:00:42.314]  It could be very benign subject matter such as maybe talking about the Hoosiers, you know, pictures of his family and friends hanging out with the constituents at barbecues and so forth.
[00:00:42.714 --> 00:00:47.496]  But is it unethical for somebody to use taxpayer funds to promote themselves in a positive light?
[00:00:47.836 --> 00:00:55.339]  Governor Mike Pence is starting a state-run taxpayer-funded news outlet that will make pre-written news stories available to Indiana media.
[00:00:55.979 --> 00:01:01.662]  As well as sometimes break news about his administration, according to documents obtained by the Indianapolis Star.
[00:01:02.002 --> 00:01:11.067]  The news service has two dedicated employees, whose combined salary is nearly $100,000, according to a search of the state employees' salary data.
[00:01:11.628 --> 00:01:15.250]  Another journalist put it this way, Mike Pence's horrible idea.
[00:01:16.232 --> 00:01:20.493]  In recent months, the administration has hired staff, including a former journalist.
[00:01:20.853 --> 00:01:24.213]  They have written test stories and quietly worked toward the launch date.
[00:01:24.534 --> 00:01:26.514]  And this is just in news media.
[00:01:26.554 --> 00:01:29.514]  This is the organization that wants to launch the news outlet.
[00:01:29.554 --> 00:01:32.255]  And I do believe it's going to start up pretty soon.
[00:01:32.575 --> 00:01:35.816]  And for all the previously mentioned reasons, yes, this does concern me.
[00:01:36.096 --> 00:01:37.496]  But it's not just in Indiana.
[00:01:37.816 --> 00:01:42.737]  We see via the FCC the government is controlling a lot of what you see on mainstream television.
[00:01:43.157 --> 00:01:48.162]  In 2014, the FCC Commissioner lifted a lid on a shocking White House proposal.
[00:01:48.854 --> 00:01:56.801]  That would put researchers in the newsroom with reporters, editors, and station owners to find out how they decided which stories to run with.
[00:01:57.101 --> 00:02:00.784]  It's very shocking indeed, and yes, I do believe that will lead to media censorship.
[00:02:01.065 --> 00:02:04.427]  People being intimidated by constantly having somebody looking over their shoulder.
[00:02:04.688 --> 00:02:08.311]  And let us not forget that the CIA will now openly propagandize Americans.
[00:02:08.651 --> 00:02:10.893]  That's an article from 2013 by Kurt Nimmo.
[00:02:11.053 --> 00:02:12.514]  And we'll end tonight with this.
[00:02:12.915 --> 00:02:16.258]  The government has promised to stop lying because of sites like the Drudge Report.
[00:02:16.778 --> 00:02:23.643]  And to anybody skeptical that the government would ever lie or purposely withhold information, take a look at this clip from the Department of Defense.
[00:02:24.023 --> 00:02:27.105]  You can find more reports on InfoWars.com.
[00:02:28.486 --> 00:02:33.990]  Looking to the broader military community, all leaders must understand the role of the press and the importance of working with the media.
[00:02:35.411 --> 00:02:37.233]  And we cannot hide our bad news stories.
[00:02:38.434 --> 00:02:43.917]  Bad news gets out one way or the other, and we must come to terms with telling the bad stories as well as the good.
[00:02:45.014 --> 00:02:50.582]  When bad things happen, the American people should hear it from us, not as a scoop on the Drudge Report.
[00:02:52.485 --> 00:02:56.451]  Unlike many fine red wines, bad news does not get better with age.
[00:03:05.151 --> 00:03:07.132]  The Molon Lave Silver Coin.
[00:03:07.453 --> 00:03:09.214]  Certified by the Provident Mint.
[00:03:09.394 --> 00:03:13.636]  This one ounce silver round is .999% fine silver.
[00:03:13.877 --> 00:03:21.542]  Inspired by the legendary Spartan King Leonidas and his refusal to lay down arms in defiance of Emperor Xerxes.
[00:03:21.762 --> 00:03:22.542]  Molon Lave.
[00:03:22.702 --> 00:03:24.383]  That's Greek for come and take it.
