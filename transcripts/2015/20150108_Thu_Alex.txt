[00:00:16.693 --> 00:00:17.333]  Big Brother.
[00:00:18.013 --> 00:00:19.034]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:19.774 --> 00:00:20.974]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:21.514 --> 00:00:22.374]  You want answers?
[00:00:23.114 --> 00:00:24.074]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:24.674 --> 00:00:28.295]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:28.855 --> 00:00:32.916]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:37.543 --> 00:00:46.928]  We've got a lot of conflicting reports out of France, NBC News and others reported that several of the suspects have been shot in shootouts.
[00:00:46.968 --> 00:00:48.269]  Turned out that wasn't true.
[00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:51.651]  Now they say one of the younger of the three has turned themselves in.
[00:00:52.572 --> 00:01:05.239]  Bloomberg and others are reporting, with the video clips, we have them coming up, what we already knew that ISIS or Al-Qaeda by a new name, they fly the same flags, follow the same Wahhabist ideology,
[00:01:06.428 --> 00:01:15.815]  A week before, about five days before, the attacks of yesterday called in their weekly video for attacks inside France.
[00:01:17.696 --> 00:01:21.018]  And we have those jihadi videos coming up today.
[00:01:24.841 --> 00:01:28.564]  Here's the headline, Islamic State Video Threatened Jihad on France.
[00:01:31.946 --> 00:01:33.027]  That is from Bloomberg.
[00:01:34.332 --> 00:01:40.053]  Third, French police officer killed as terror suspects reportedly spotted a female police officer was shot.
[00:01:41.434 --> 00:01:45.735]  Turns out the police officer who begged for his life said, don't shoot, in English.
[00:01:46.855 --> 00:01:49.796]  People keep asking why they say it in English because that's the international language.
[00:01:49.836 --> 00:01:51.396]  He was guessing they might be foreigners.
[00:01:51.856 --> 00:01:54.137]  So he said, don't shoot, don't shoot, and they shot him in the head.
[00:01:54.497 --> 00:01:55.417]  He was a Muslim.
[00:01:57.765 --> 00:02:01.690]  So that shows right there how there is a major rift in Islam.
[00:02:02.371 --> 00:02:06.256]  And I'm not here as an apologist for Islam or here as an attacker of Islam.
[00:02:06.677 --> 00:02:08.059]  I'm just trying to state the facts here.
[00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.847]  That most Muslims are not radicals that want to run around and kill everybody.
[00:02:16.058 --> 00:02:31.384]  But they are bullied basically by the quote extremist and by Saudi Arabia and others that are trying to export radical brands of Islam with State Department help around the world to destabilize areas they want to take over.
[00:02:31.764 --> 00:02:34.345]  Radical Islam is a type of shock force that they use.
[00:02:36.786 --> 00:02:44.809]  Speaking of that, Ahmad Salam, I'm really excited about this big interview, who was the FBI informant
[00:02:46.135 --> 00:02:52.937]  And he was with the Egyptian CIA who infiltrated the mosque that was planning to blow up the World Trade Center.
[00:02:53.806 --> 00:03:00.692]  And then the FBI basically had Salaam help them build a real bomb, despite his protest, then gave them real detonators.
[00:03:01.212 --> 00:03:03.614]  He tried to stop the bombing and was told to stand down.
[00:03:03.954 --> 00:03:10.199]  He knew he was being set up, so he recorded the FBI, famously, the tapes have been released, saying, go ahead.
[00:03:10.259 --> 00:03:15.904]  He was given a big settlement in that as well by the federal government when they tried to demonize him.
[00:03:16.424 --> 00:03:17.325]  And he had the evidence.
[00:03:17.906 --> 00:03:19.347]  He is a listener of the broadcast.
[00:03:22.543 --> 00:03:28.167]  And I'm excited that he's going to be coming on the broadcast.
[00:03:28.207 --> 00:03:32.630]  He sent me this about six months ago to Alex, hoping that one day we can talk.
[00:03:33.491 --> 00:03:34.231]  Ahmad Salam.
[00:03:35.072 --> 00:03:39.155]  He is going to be coming on the broadcast today inside False Flag Terror.
[00:03:40.095 --> 00:03:49.342]  Because it's still false flag if you go find a bunch of crazy jihadis and then open every door for them and cook them a bomb and give them detonators.
[00:03:51.345 --> 00:04:00.453]  By the grace of God, the two idiots they had parked the truck did not park it where they were told, or could have taken out one of the main support columns and brought down one of the World Trade Center towers.
[00:04:00.933 --> 00:04:04.116]  You know that happened again nine years later.
[00:04:07.839 --> 00:04:17.567]  In 2001, September 11th, this is a big interview with Ahmad Salam, the untold story of Al Qaeda, the FBI, and the CIA in America.
[00:04:18.553 --> 00:04:21.635]  This is the stuff Hollywood movies should be made of.
[00:04:24.216 --> 00:04:28.838]  So that's coming up today in the third hour.
[00:04:29.318 --> 00:04:44.466]  We are going to have open phones today to cover the waterfront and also talk about the news that has been covered up or smokescreened via the attacks in Paris.
[00:04:44.506 --> 00:04:46.187]  But the attacks in Paris are important
[00:04:47.281 --> 00:04:51.704]  Because they reveal that we now have CBS News, Bloomberg, AP, Reuters, CNN.
[00:04:52.024 --> 00:04:56.286]  I've got all the clips here, all the articles saying, oh my gosh, ISIS is so horrible.
[00:04:56.827 --> 00:04:58.307]  They're behind the attack in Paris.
[00:04:59.088 --> 00:05:00.469]  ISIS is Al Qaeda.
[00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:09.194]  And it was funded and given new life by the West in the last four years in the Middle East.
[00:05:10.831 --> 00:05:14.332]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[00:05:14.493 --> 00:05:18.454]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[00:05:18.774 --> 00:05:20.235]  Can you put two and two together?
[00:05:20.555 --> 00:05:28.138]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[00:05:28.418 --> 00:05:29.259]  But for how long?
[00:05:29.559 --> 00:05:35.822]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com, spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[00:05:36.202 --> 00:05:39.003]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[00:05:40.503 --> 00:05:43.645]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[00:05:43.965 --> 00:05:51.989]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:57.232]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[00:05:57.633 --> 00:05:59.914]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[00:06:00.154 --> 00:06:01.955]  We now have the synergistic solution.

[00:06:10.715 --> 00:06:13.297]  Every year we make resolutions to lose weight and get in shape.
[00:06:13.397 --> 00:06:14.538]  And the truth is, it's hard.
[00:06:14.818 --> 00:06:16.279]  Even with diet and exercise.
[00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:21.543]  Because of toxic food in our environment that is stressing our bodies more than ever before.
[00:06:21.664 --> 00:06:28.509]  Working with experts in nutrition and biochemistry, I found that super high quality nutraceuticals, in addition to my diet and exercise,
[00:06:28.809 --> 00:06:30.792]  Worthy answers that synergistically worked.
[00:06:31.053 --> 00:06:37.543]  I can see the drastic changes every day with the amount of weight I've lost, my increased stamina, and more of a twinkle in my eye.
[00:06:37.883 --> 00:06:43.813]  That's why we are now so excited to launch the InfoWars Life Resolution Pack, combining three essential formulations.
[00:06:44.273 --> 00:06:52.019]  Oxygen-Based Cleanser Oxy Powder, The Secret 12 Bioavailable Vitamin B12, and your choice of Super Female or Super Male Vitality.
[00:06:52.179 --> 00:06:58.784]  Now all available at a discounted price to you and your family to bring in the new year and make 2015 a true success.

[00:07:00.325 --> 00:07:03.448]  2015 is the year to do it and it all starts at Infowarslife.com.
[00:07:10.533 --> 00:07:17.538]  For all of recorded history, civilizations around the world praised the health benefits of silver.

[00:07:27.364 --> 00:07:35.329]  You don't have to be a doctor to know the fall and winter months are the most dangerous time of year in North America when it comes to you and your family's health.
[00:07:35.629 --> 00:07:45.056]  Infowarslife.com is very excited to announce our biggest run yet of silver bullet colloidal silver exclusively available at Infowarslife.com.

[00:08:19.602 --> 00:08:22.487]  Another time in the Age of Wonder.
[00:08:35.883 --> 00:08:40.985]  Here's the problem with the globalist multicultural plan.
[00:08:41.025 --> 00:08:43.026]  It's being directed from the beginning.
[00:09:04.983 --> 00:09:12.085]  To cause balkanization, to cause neo-segregation, that the state then referees.
[00:09:13.045 --> 00:09:25.069]  This is the Ford Foundation, socialist, cloward and piven, great game, divide and conquer, balkanization program writ large.
[00:09:27.129 --> 00:09:33.431]  And there's now music videos that the suspect shooters in France are involved in.
[00:09:35.151 --> 00:09:37.271]  Glorifying, bringing down French culture.
[00:09:38.392 --> 00:09:39.672]  You gotta love the French socialist.
[00:09:40.392 --> 00:09:51.654]  Open up the borders, bring in giant populations, foreigner populations, now about half of the French population, and then they want to bring down what's left of France.
[00:09:51.754 --> 00:09:53.155]  And don't worry, it will collapse.
[00:09:54.215 --> 00:09:58.636]  And the big banks will suck it dry and move on, like they've done to countless other countries.
[00:10:00.575 --> 00:10:07.809]  You have a synthetic, globalist, corporate, plastic culture that will not allow anyone to have their own culture.
[00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:30.795]  Unless it is a dirt-floored, women being raped, being put into sex slavery, heads chopped off, burning mosques, burning churches, burning synagogues, radical Saudi Arabian, Wahhabi-funded, Al-Qaeda jihadis, then you'll have the State Department for 50 years funding you, as the Washington Post reported a decade ago.
[00:10:31.656 --> 00:10:34.437]  You'll have the State Department currently funding it.
[00:10:35.017 --> 00:10:52.244]  You'll have tens of billions of dollars the last four and a half years given to Al-Qaeda to start it up again in Western Iraq to then invade Syria with Turkey's aid and NATO's aid to kill 300,000 plus people and to be called heroes by CNN.
[00:10:55.911 --> 00:11:23.986]  And the system thinks that the public is so incredibly, irrevocably stupid that they're on the news today going, oh my gosh, either ISIS connected, they may have gotten the training in Jordan, or in Yemen, or in Western Iraq, or in Syria,
[00:11:25.228 --> 00:11:31.272]  And we know there's connections to them back to ISIS and ISIL, Islamic State.
[00:11:32.973 --> 00:11:37.436]  Do you remember Ted Cruz saying last year, we're not the Air Force for Al Qaeda?
[00:11:37.456 --> 00:11:39.558]  Do you remember Rand Paul talking?
[00:11:39.918 --> 00:11:50.805]  Do you remember us and Congressman Walter Jones and former Congressman Ron Paul warning everyone and predicting not dozens, not hundreds, but 300, 400, 500 times?
[00:11:53.300 --> 00:12:02.946]  That you would have mass shootings at schools, churches, synagogues, newspapers and media facilities.
[00:12:04.907 --> 00:12:05.788]  And now it's happening.
[00:12:07.169 --> 00:12:11.231]  I don't even need to go dredge up all the articles and all the videos and all the special reports.
[00:12:11.251 --> 00:12:13.133]  In fact, I'm not even going to do it.
[00:12:17.495 --> 00:12:21.318]  Anyone who's a regular listener knows we've done it to an obnoxious level.
[00:12:23.106 --> 00:12:23.947]  And now it's happening.
[00:12:25.348 --> 00:12:45.422]  We knew three, four years ago when Benghazi took place that they were being given Stinger missiles by the thousands, MPADs, surface-to-air missiles, heat-seeking missiles, line-of-sight missiles, you name it, low-tech, high-tech, high-energy weapons.
[00:12:45.762 --> 00:12:49.045]  We've had the whistleblowers on from the CIA by name.
[00:12:50.270 --> 00:12:52.591]  We've had the special forces colonels on.
[00:12:53.171 --> 00:12:54.692]  We've given you all the sources!
[00:12:58.293 --> 00:13:02.074]  In an hour and 45 minutes, Ahmaud Salaam in the third hour joins us.
[00:13:03.775 --> 00:13:15.719]  In the New York Times in 1993, the government having to admit that they basically cooked the bomb, trained the drivers, gave them the detonators, and Ahmaud Salaam tried to stop it as an FBI informant and blew the whistle.
[00:13:16.019 --> 00:13:18.420]  John O'Neill, the deputy director of the FBI at the time,
[00:13:19.963 --> 00:13:31.667]  Went public over it and resigned one week before 9-11 saying they're going to allow Al-Qaeda to blow up the World Trade Center and that was in the Sunday Telegraph of England.
[00:13:32.647 --> 00:13:33.788]  He gave that speech in England.
[00:13:34.148 --> 00:13:39.029]  We've got Ahmad Salam coming on the broadcast in the third hour today.
[00:13:41.750 --> 00:13:46.552]  I've had former Justice Department officials on the broadcast
[00:13:48.516 --> 00:13:57.158]  Who, when they had the 7-7 bombings, went on air and said, the leader of the 7-7 bombers is MI6.
[00:13:57.498 --> 00:14:07.020]  And then three months later, it came out in the British News, that indeed, the leader was MI6 and was being protected and led the attack.
[00:14:10.701 --> 00:14:12.001]  Radical Islam is real!
[00:14:14.269 --> 00:14:28.879]  And it's being brought in and nurtured and funded and protected, and it's being prepared to be given full control of Africa, the Middle East, Central Asia, and the Far East.
[00:14:29.679 --> 00:14:43.429]  Islam, you can debate it all day long, is being taken over by an alliance of the big megacorporations, the big oil companies in OPEC,
[00:14:44.531 --> 00:14:48.173]  The big insurance companies and radical Islam.
[00:14:51.014 --> 00:15:00.419]  And anyone who wants progress like Assad or Muammar Gaddafi, and I'm not saying either one of them's an angel, but compared to Al-Qaeda, they are angels.
[00:15:00.939 --> 00:15:02.760]  Compared to Al-Qaeda, they are lions.
[00:15:05.561 --> 00:15:11.484]  It's like saying a bank robber's an angel compared to Jeffrey Dahmer.
[00:15:13.775 --> 00:15:20.581]  Or a German soldier on the Eastern Front in 1943 is an angel compared to Adolf Hitler.
[00:15:23.323 --> 00:15:26.626]  The point is, it's a fact.
[00:15:26.746 --> 00:15:30.550]  It's being protected all along.
[00:15:31.511 --> 00:15:38.197]  In fact, here it is out of the New York Times in 2012.
[00:15:42.421 --> 00:15:44.101]  I have two articles I'm going to show to TV viewers.
[00:15:44.141 --> 00:15:49.382]  I'm going to give you the name of these if you're a radio listener, and they're in public archives of the newyorktimes.com.
[00:15:50.822 --> 00:15:56.143]  Bomb informers' tapes give rare glimpse of FBI's dealings.
[00:16:00.024 --> 00:16:08.946]  And it goes through the fact that the FBI basically created the bomb, the detonators, and let it go forward, and they got recorded by the informant who was trying to stop it.
[00:16:09.806 --> 00:16:10.906]  Ahmad Salam is joining us.
[00:16:13.868 --> 00:16:22.555]  Tapes depict proposal to thwart bomb used in trade center blast, New York Times, 1993, October 28th.
[00:16:23.115 --> 00:16:26.698]  And they go into a mausoleum trying to stop the bombing.
[00:16:26.718 --> 00:16:34.584]  43-year-old former Egyptian army officer who tried to stop it was told to stand down.
[00:16:34.925 --> 00:16:37.487]  This guy is a living, smoking gun.
[00:16:38.828 --> 00:16:40.149]  We're going to have him today.
[00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:43.642]  And then here's a newer article, 2012.
[00:16:43.722 --> 00:16:46.485]  Terrorist plots hatched by the FBI.
[00:16:46.785 --> 00:16:50.969]  The United States has been narrowly saved from lethal terrorist plots in recent years, or so it has seemed.
[00:16:51.350 --> 00:16:53.632]  A would-be suicide bomber was intercepted on his way to the Capitol.
[00:16:53.952 --> 00:16:59.758]  A scheme to bomb synagogues and shoot Stinger missiles at military aircraft was developed by men in Newborough, New York.
[00:17:00.697 --> 00:17:06.381]  And the fanciful idea to fly explosive-laden model planes in the Pentagon, and the Capitol was hatched in Massachusetts.
[00:17:06.802 --> 00:17:18.291]  But all these dramas were facilitated by the FBI, whose undercover agents and informers posed as terrorists, offering dummy missiles, fake C-4 explosives, and disarmed suicide vests at rudimentary training.
[00:17:18.631 --> 00:17:21.113]  Suspects naively played their parts until they were arrested.
[00:17:22.073 --> 00:17:30.160]  In the case of 7-7, though, you had patsies that believed they were part of a drill, which we confirmed, and broke here,
[00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:41.884]  Because we had a source inside the bus company and then later it was admitted that there were drills of the exact same targets being hit at the exact same time that day.
[00:17:42.344 --> 00:17:43.924]  The two trains and the bus.
[00:17:45.245 --> 00:17:47.105]  Ready to play the clips of BBC News?
[00:17:47.846 --> 00:17:54.008]  Where they have the head of Scotland Yard saying, it's incredible!
[00:17:55.307 --> 00:17:59.049]  Then the head of visor consultancy, he'd been the head, said, it's incredible!
[00:17:59.069 --> 00:18:02.951]  We were running drills at the exact same time, it's being hit at the exact same time!
[00:18:03.671 --> 00:18:04.892]  Hiding it in plain view.
[00:18:08.454 --> 00:18:20.980]  And they took school teachers, secular guys that went to topless bars, who thought they were getting some extra money to drill to fight radical Islam, and they were led
[00:18:23.740 --> 00:18:30.087]  By MI6, double agent Al Qaeda, so they could put out the messages that it was real.
[00:18:30.367 --> 00:18:36.553]  But some of them figured it out and ran and were gunned down probably by MI6 at Canary Wharf.
[00:18:36.634 --> 00:18:37.895]  And that was in the news that day.
[00:18:38.736 --> 00:18:46.464]  I then flew days after to London and covered the event live on the ground.
[00:18:48.004 --> 00:18:53.926]  I made the film, Terror Storm, a history of government-sponsored terror.
[00:18:55.126 --> 00:18:56.447]  We show the Soviets doing it.
[00:19:00.788 --> 00:19:07.311]  We show the entire Nazi system doing it, the Tsars before the Soviets, the U.S.
[00:19:07.331 --> 00:19:08.011]  government doing it.
[00:19:08.051 --> 00:19:14.513]  It's the oldest trick in the book.
[00:19:17.557 --> 00:19:38.591]  So when we come back, hiding in plain view, terrorists, probably real jihadis, trained, are running around, killing 12 people in the newspaper, 3 cops now, 2 yesterday, 1 today.
[00:19:41.138 --> 00:19:49.681]  And they're going to use this to take more of our basic freedoms, and they are announcing more draconian legislation to protect us, while the border stays wide open, and the same thing in Europe.
[00:19:51.202 --> 00:20:08.928]  But even mainstream news is now pointing out that the orders are coming from Islamic State, again the group funded by the West, protected, given a safe haven, and it's in the news that it looks like these guys may have gotten training with IS as well.
[00:20:10.322 --> 00:20:14.163]  The CDC just announced flu vaccines may have the wrong strain of flu virus.
[00:20:14.404 --> 00:20:15.544]  You may not be protected.

[00:22:09.005 --> 00:22:13.047]  Hey everyone, I'm having lots of fun with my new Ghost 80% AR-15.
[00:22:13.407 --> 00:22:15.048]  This baby shoots like a dream.
[00:22:15.148 --> 00:22:16.869]  Hey, thanks Guns80.com.
[00:22:17.189 --> 00:22:20.031]  You know, friends ask me all the time why I wanted a Ghost AR-15.
[00:22:20.251 --> 00:22:21.391]  That's easy.
[00:22:21.732 --> 00:22:28.455]  You see, my buddy Mark kept telling me that I'd better go to Guns80.com to get myself a Ghost AR-15 before they outlawed them.
[00:22:28.975 --> 00:22:30.736]  I thought he was just paranoid, so I ignored it.
[00:22:30.816 --> 00:22:31.417]  Well, at first.
[00:22:32.017 --> 00:22:40.062]  But then I started hearing government media types talking about making guns illegal, about the president signing on to a UN treaty that could take my gun rights away.
[00:22:40.082 --> 00:22:41.543]  You know, it really bugged me.
[00:22:41.583 --> 00:22:45.545]  So I dug in, I did the research, and I realized that Mark was right all along.
[00:22:46.365 --> 00:22:50.308]  I know now that having an unregistered ghost AR-15 is the right answer.
[00:22:50.848 --> 00:22:53.530]  I'm a proud 80% Ghost AR-15 convert.

[00:24:11.763 --> 00:24:16.866]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:24:17.587 --> 00:24:19.788]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:24:26.273 --> 00:24:30.276]  So I want to open the phones up to get your take on everything you see unfolding.
[00:24:31.217 --> 00:24:38.482]  Are you ready for them to pass more laws to legitimize illegal spying and checkpoints on the highways while the border stays wide open?
[00:24:39.778 --> 00:24:47.622]  Are you ready to see more political correctness forced on our throats, teaching us that our speech is what caused the shootings in Paris?
[00:24:48.783 --> 00:24:54.006]  Not the fact that it was Western-funded terror groups that were allowed to flourish that did it?
[00:24:56.527 --> 00:24:58.868]  There's a Arabia debate that is erupting.
[00:24:58.928 --> 00:25:00.629]  I'm looking at Businessweek.com.
[00:25:01.370 --> 00:25:06.753]  DrudgeReport.com has the image of the Eiffel Tower with the crescent moon above it.
[00:25:07.393 --> 00:25:09.154]  A very powerful image.
[00:25:10.894 --> 00:25:31.165]  And political correctness keeps us from discussing the fact that how would folks feel, say, in Egypt or Saudi Arabia if, say, a hundred million Germans, even though there aren't a hundred million Germans, there's about 65 million Germans, moved
[00:25:32.978 --> 00:25:33.878]  into their countries.
[00:25:34.819 --> 00:25:43.702]  It's more than a hundred million Muslims that have migrated in the last 50 years to Europe and the United States and other Western countries, and then they have high birth rates.
[00:25:44.202 --> 00:25:46.143]  The West has been taught, don't have children.
[00:25:46.763 --> 00:25:47.823]  It's bad to be Christian.
[00:25:47.883 --> 00:25:48.844]  It's bad to be white.
[00:25:49.944 --> 00:25:51.284]  It's bad to be a father.
[00:25:51.345 --> 00:25:52.545]  It's bad to be manly.
[00:25:53.285 --> 00:25:56.026]  It's bad if you make any of the decisions in your household.
[00:25:56.106 --> 00:25:57.447]  The woman makes all the decisions.
[00:25:58.007 --> 00:26:00.968]  But if you want to sexually mutilate women and chop their heads off, it's trendy.
[00:26:03.046 --> 00:26:11.353]  There's that sick alliance of political correctness and the Ford Foundation, just like there is with Mecha and La Raza, to break up the West and conquer us.
[00:26:12.935 --> 00:26:19.421]  And then to put the Muslims and everybody else into different barrios, into different slums, into different segregated areas.
[00:26:19.681 --> 00:26:26.367]  And that's in the news today, admitting that France has turned into a segregated area, which is then managed by government.
[00:26:27.819 --> 00:26:33.404]  Bloomberg Businessweek asks, Europe's Islam debate erupts as Paris killers at large.
[00:26:35.285 --> 00:26:42.011]  Just a day before the shooting yesterday, they were talking about banning anti-open border, anti-radical Islamist rallies in Germany.
[00:26:44.053 --> 00:26:52.740]  The bodies haven't been buried and the killers are on the loose, but that didn't prevent anti-Islam politicians across Europe from seizing on yesterday's massacre in Paris.
[00:26:53.481 --> 00:26:54.742]  Oh, they seized on it.
[00:26:55.458 --> 00:27:02.640]  The rhetoric varied and intensely across the European Union in 28 countries, each with its own religious and social phobias.
[00:27:02.700 --> 00:27:04.981]  Oh, it's a phobia not to want to be shot in the head.
[00:27:06.821 --> 00:27:14.843]  Many gripped by an economic recession that makes convenient scapegoats of immigrants, especially those with veils, turbans, and non-white skin.
[00:27:15.944 --> 00:27:19.745]  I wish my daughter will be free tomorrow to go around without a veil, without any fears.
[00:27:22.526 --> 00:27:33.974]  Mattito Salvini, head of Italy's anti-immigration Northern League said, well how dare him say that he wants his daughter to be able to not have to wear a veil because that's where this is going!
[00:27:35.755 --> 00:27:38.157]  Radical Islam is taking over Islam.
[00:27:38.617 --> 00:27:51.486]  They're going into any country where women get to go to college and don't wear veils and killing them or chopping their you-know-what off because it's not good for a woman to have any pleasure, for heaven's sakes.
[00:27:52.628 --> 00:27:53.669]  I mean, I reject it!
[00:27:53.789 --> 00:28:01.455]  I don't want to live with a bunch of guys running around grabbing my daughters and putting them into sex slavery in North Africa and calling it trendy!
[00:28:01.835 --> 00:28:04.457]  And having to hear Gloria Steinem talk about how great it is all day!
[00:28:04.978 --> 00:28:10.863]  Gloria Steinem just wants to destroy the American male so she can dominate us and run over us for a bunch of criminal banks!
[00:28:11.343 --> 00:28:16.967]  She works for the CIA, and the CIA works for the globalists from its setting up in 1949. 1947.
[00:28:20.370 --> 00:28:23.471]  Didn't get rolling until 1949, though, but the National Security Act was 47.
[00:28:25.871 --> 00:28:34.354]  And I just love how there's this big flogging in the media that how dare anyone criticize the jihadis?
[00:28:35.314 --> 00:28:37.175]  How dare anybody say anything about it?
[00:28:39.915 --> 00:28:42.396]  And then they create this big backlash
[00:28:45.094 --> 00:29:02.779]  against it in conservative movements that then just gets crystallized and transmuted into support for taking everybody's liberties and living in a police state when the whole police state on record is shut up for returning veterans gun owners
[00:29:04.707 --> 00:29:17.094]  Conservatives, Libertarians, Christians, pro-lifers, anti-UNers, anybody who has a brain cell, anybody who wants to live in a somewhat free country.
[00:29:17.935 --> 00:29:20.596]  So I want to hear from you on all this and more.
[00:29:20.676 --> 00:29:22.557]  First-time callers, again, 1-800-259-9231, 800-2599231.
[00:29:22.577 --> 00:29:25.699]  Now when we come back, I will play the clip.
[00:29:33.254 --> 00:29:37.735]  ISIS video threatened attack on France days before the attacks.
[00:29:38.235 --> 00:29:45.537]  Now there's open links to Western military training ISIS and that training being given over to the jihadis.
[00:29:46.157 --> 00:29:48.218]  Wait till they start shooting down airliners.
[00:29:49.218 --> 00:29:52.739]  We'll be here pointing out that we predicted it back when they gave them the stingers.
[00:29:53.699 --> 00:29:57.700]  See, this is all being done to take our freedoms.
[00:29:57.860 --> 00:29:58.320]  Stay with us.
[00:30:00.031 --> 00:30:00.952]  We're on the march.
[00:30:01.432 --> 00:30:02.713]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:30:02.733 --> 00:30:03.994]  It's the best enemies money can buy.
[00:30:04.014 --> 00:30:06.776]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:11.379 --> 00:30:13.981]  Every year we make resolutions to lose weight and get in shape.
[00:30:14.081 --> 00:30:15.222]  And the truth is, it's hard.
[00:30:15.482 --> 00:30:16.963]  Even with diet and exercise.
[00:30:17.163 --> 00:30:22.207]  Because of toxic food and our environment that is stressing our bodies more than ever before.
[00:30:22.347 --> 00:30:27.050]  Working with experts in nutrition and biochemistry, I found that super high quality nutraceuticals
[00:30:27.270 --> 00:30:31.473]  In addition to my diet and exercise, were the answers that synergistically worked.
[00:30:31.713 --> 00:30:38.197]  I can see the drastic changes every day with the amount of weight I've lost, my increased stamina, and more of a twinkle in my eye.
[00:30:38.537 --> 00:30:44.461]  That's why we are now so excited to launch the InfoWars Life Resolution Pack, combining three essential formulations.
[00:30:44.941 --> 00:30:52.666]  Oxygen-Based Cleanser Oxy Powder, the Secret 12 Bioavailable Vitamin B12, and your choice of Super Female or Super Male Vitality.
[00:30:52.846 --> 00:30:59.449]  Now all available at a discounted price to you and your family to bring in the new year and make 2015 a true success.

[00:31:00.990 --> 00:31:04.112]  2015 is the year to do it and it all starts at Infowarslife.com.
[00:31:11.196 --> 00:31:22.342]  Sold out for weeks due to the difficult and extensive proprietary process behind its creation, the exclusive InfoWars Life Secret 12 formulation is now back in stock in the last limited shipment of 2014.
[00:31:22.582 --> 00:31:36.368]  The most bioactive form that has been created with our proprietary process, this ultra-clean vitamin B12 nutraceutical has been carefully crafted and developed over the last two years and is based on cellular science of how your body actively absorbs essential nutrients.
[00:31:36.809 --> 00:31:39.610]  Secret 12 is taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.
[00:31:39.890 --> 00:31:41.070]  No needles, no injections.
[00:31:41.311 --> 00:31:45.352]  Vitamin B12 deficiency is linked to scores of serious problems.
[00:31:45.652 --> 00:31:54.935]  And Secret 12 is a fusion of two organic, proprietary forms of Vitamin B12, bringing you a true nutraceutical quality of Vitamin B12.
[00:31:55.275 --> 00:31:55.975]  Secret 12.

[00:32:02.017 --> 00:32:04.098]  Supplies of Secret 12 are very limited.

[00:32:11.221 --> 00:32:12.441]  Another major health threat.
[00:32:12.481 --> 00:32:17.363]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[00:32:17.443 --> 00:32:20.044]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[00:32:20.064 --> 00:32:26.907]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[00:32:27.167 --> 00:32:30.008]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[00:32:30.148 --> 00:32:33.069]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[00:32:33.089 --> 00:32:35.109]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.

[00:33:30.839 --> 00:33:31.179]  Disinformation.
[00:33:31.199 --> 00:33:31.660]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:31.680 --> 00:33:31.740]  800-259-9231.
[00:33:31.860 --> 00:33:33.041]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:33:33.081 --> 00:33:36.764]  Yesterday I made this point, and here it is in the news today.
[00:33:55.993 --> 00:34:08.541]  The hip-hop gangster culture that's pushed by MTV is so toxic, so destructive, so weaponized by different Western intelligence agencies on record.
[00:34:09.901 --> 00:34:11.743]  Those are big claims, you can just go look it up.
[00:34:13.944 --> 00:34:20.208]  That it has become the dominant new culture with the Arab gangs.
[00:34:21.428 --> 00:34:22.429]  All over Europe.
[00:34:22.489 --> 00:34:27.132]  I've seen it with my own eyeballs, but following the news daily, I see it perpetually.
[00:34:28.153 --> 00:34:32.756]  A few years ago, London burning, other cities burning, Paris burning.
[00:34:33.656 --> 00:34:42.422]  With the young jihadis out, they're there to make their bones to show what superstars they are.
[00:34:45.905 --> 00:34:50.408]  And now it comes out that the reported terrorists, two of the shooters,
[00:34:52.093 --> 00:34:53.634]  Put out a rap video.
[00:34:53.674 --> 00:34:55.936]  In fact, we have some of that footage for TV viewers.
[00:34:55.956 --> 00:34:58.218]  We'll roll some of that in the background.
[00:34:58.978 --> 00:35:19.475]  And this is just your average narcissistic, mentally ill type person who really wants to be somebody, who gets attracted to the narcissist-based gangster rap, which is basically like a cult brainwashing chant.
[00:35:22.199 --> 00:35:39.622]  Where they have these very simplistic beats over and over again about how great you are, you're a god, you're the best, you're unstoppable, you're incredible, and when you have a culturalist, mindless population, I don't care if you're Arab, I don't care if you're a white Christian, a black,
[00:35:40.694 --> 00:36:04.033]  Christian, whoever you are, an atheist, this stuff is designed to target young people, designed to make them think they're gods, and then when it doesn't deliver hip-hop stardom, when you don't become a MacG, when you're living in a trash can because you're cool, when you're being inducted into the prison system, you get mad.
[00:36:04.053 --> 00:36:06.816]  And what I've noticed, and I've talked about this last year and this year,
[00:36:09.016 --> 00:36:16.280]  Ad nauseum is that it's a mixture of Al Qaeda meets hip-hop meets gangster thugism.
[00:36:17.561 --> 00:36:23.565]  Gotta love Al Qaeda guys with their shorts hanging down over their butts like they're punks in prison advertising their tail.
[00:36:25.046 --> 00:36:25.987]  That's what that means.
[00:36:26.727 --> 00:36:28.489]  And notice that fad's been around 30 years.
[00:36:28.549 --> 00:36:29.450]  It never goes away.
[00:36:29.910 --> 00:36:31.451]  Because you're being inducted into prison.
[00:36:32.132 --> 00:36:35.475]  You dress in a punk uniform so the police are alerted to you as an enemy.
[00:36:35.495 --> 00:36:39.938]  So you can be inducted directly into prison and then be gang raped as soon as you get there.
[00:36:40.599 --> 00:36:47.244]  Because I'll assure you, the people that are going to be raping you, don't wear their drawers down hanging behind their booty.
[00:36:48.725 --> 00:36:51.768]  But see, it's what a sick joke the social engineers put out.
[00:36:53.251 --> 00:37:08.076]  They got a big, fat, fake Rick Ross up there, a former prison guard, who figured out, he was a prison guard over a bunch of black slaves, figuring out he could be a real slave master by inducting the brothers right into the assembly line of slavery.
[00:37:11.877 --> 00:37:15.098]  And then he steals the identity of a real gangster, Rick Ross.
[00:37:17.839 --> 00:37:19.760]  Who, by the way, wore suits and ties and
[00:37:20.865 --> 00:37:25.227]  Threw a brand new Mercedes Benz and didn't have his drawers hanging down over his butt.
[00:37:26.388 --> 00:37:27.528]  Regardless of what you think about him.
[00:37:29.209 --> 00:37:32.671]  Because real gangsters don't have their drawers hanging down over their butt!
[00:37:33.631 --> 00:37:34.271]  You idiots!
[00:37:36.232 --> 00:37:48.898]  So in the final equation, this is a giant cultural warfare system with a bunch of radical jihadis with no future, feeling like second class citizens in France, where the French are all snobs to each other.
[00:37:49.198 --> 00:37:50.439]  Imagine being an Arab there.
[00:37:52.210 --> 00:38:09.442]  You're invited in by the left to be a new socialist voting bloc, because they pay you racial lip service, and now you want to be big stars, so you go out and you shoot ten people at a newspaper, because you go online and you watch the CIA
[00:38:11.500 --> 00:38:19.865]  Slash Interpol, slash NATO, slash Turkish, slash Israeli, slash behind the whole thing Saudi Arabia.
[00:38:20.506 --> 00:38:24.128]  And they tell you time to carry out jihad in France, my brothers.
[00:38:25.969 --> 00:38:31.252]  You're not gonna be anybody as La Rapper, La Froggy.
[00:38:31.272 --> 00:38:38.277]  And I love watching these young wannabe rappers, white, black, Hispanic,
[00:38:39.686 --> 00:38:42.588]  Arab, it doesn't matter, with that same fake confidence.
[00:38:42.608 --> 00:38:43.008]  Yeah!
[00:38:43.028 --> 00:38:44.129]  I'm going somewhere!
[00:38:44.249 --> 00:38:44.689]  Yeah!
[00:38:44.869 --> 00:38:45.870]  I'm gonna be somebody!
[00:38:45.910 --> 00:38:46.490]  Yeah!
[00:38:47.430 --> 00:38:56.335]  All a fake synthetic weapon developed inside DARPA to ruin you and your family and it's done a great job.
[00:39:00.998 --> 00:39:01.378]  Kids!
[00:39:03.131 --> 00:39:07.375]  There's a lot of catchy beats in that music, and if you want to listen to it because you like the beats, that's great.
[00:39:07.855 --> 00:39:17.864]  But parents that just turn your kids over to it, and believe me, it's hard to keep my kids away from it, because it's designed to catch young minds, unsophisticated minds.
[00:39:18.684 --> 00:39:24.069]  It's a mesmerizing mind control to then suck you into a culture to be a failure.
[00:39:25.785 --> 00:39:34.591]  And if you like what rap and hip-hop in its establishment version has done to the black community, don't worry, it's doing it to every community right now.
[00:39:34.912 --> 00:39:45.059]  As you watch the world sink, like we have a thousand pound rock around our neck and a hundred feet of water, we're going to the bottom fast.
[00:39:45.499 --> 00:39:46.500]  And so, of course,
[00:39:47.583 --> 00:39:51.705]  A bunch of slimy rap was involved in this.
[00:39:52.646 --> 00:39:54.267]  That's up on Infowars.com.
[00:39:54.687 --> 00:39:55.967]  It's from the Gateway Pundit.
[00:39:56.728 --> 00:40:02.031]  Now, before we go to your phone calls, let's go ahead and go to ISIS video, CBS News.
[00:40:02.051 --> 00:40:05.773]  I mean, I have CNS News reporting on what callers talked about yesterday.
[00:40:05.793 --> 00:40:09.975]  We had a Marine call in and go, don't you remember two years ago?
[00:40:10.888 --> 00:40:13.790]  The Free Syrian Army being trained in Jordan by the Marines?
[00:40:14.110 --> 00:40:14.991]  And he listed the unit?
[00:40:15.011 --> 00:40:16.212]  In fact, pull that back up for me.
[00:40:16.612 --> 00:40:23.657]  Well, folks looked into it, and sure enough, looks like the group that trained these boys was trained by the Marine Corps.
[00:40:24.258 --> 00:40:29.662]  From the halls of Montezuma to the shores of Tripoli.
[00:40:30.262 --> 00:40:35.306]  You know about the Marines' first major engagement after we were a country under Thomas Jefferson, the President?
[00:40:36.465 --> 00:40:46.220]  They were called leathernecks because they wore leather jackets with light armor that would protect their necks somewhat from glancing swords.
[00:40:47.142 --> 00:40:51.228]  And they went out and wouldn't pay the bounty to the jihadis of that day.
[00:40:52.632 --> 00:41:10.442]  in the mediterranean but also uh... in the persian gulf and off the coast of africa on its east coast and they went in there and well you know what the marines did killed everybody engage the pirates who are openly backed by the sheik of morocco and all the rest the crew
[00:41:11.852 --> 00:41:16.875]  Of course, nowadays, Thomas Jefferson, if he was trendy, would just say, here's our daughters, have them!
[00:41:17.595 --> 00:41:24.639]  That's the thing you're supposed to do, because Thomas Jefferson would be macking the G's and homing down, yeah!
[00:41:25.660 --> 00:41:27.761]  All right, because Hollywood said it was cool.
[00:41:28.502 --> 00:41:38.127]  Fox News, you know, is even doing that, and Fox TV is betting everything they've got on promoting this type of garbage that's not even black culture.
[00:41:38.628 --> 00:41:40.829]  It's just synthetic, weaponized crap.
[00:41:41.630 --> 00:41:42.591]  Excuse me, I'm ranting.
[00:41:43.673 --> 00:41:45.475]  Let's go ahead and go to the CBS report.
[00:41:46.236 --> 00:41:53.925]  From where the terrorists come, from where they get their orders... Oh, the army funded by our degenerate criminal government!
[00:41:53.965 --> 00:41:54.546]  Here it is!
[00:41:57.017 --> 00:42:03.202]  In a video released by ISIS just days ago, a French jihadi in Syria issued a chilling order.
[00:42:06.704 --> 00:42:09.687]  Blow up France and tear it down to pieces, he said.
[00:42:10.988 --> 00:42:14.871]  Do it with a stone or a knife or whatever you can get your hands on.
[00:42:18.293 --> 00:42:19.955]  So there you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:42:20.495 --> 00:42:22.697]  And I want to be clear, there is a lot of
[00:42:24.226 --> 00:42:38.821]  Hip-hop and rap that I think has good messages, but you notice all those rappers, whether it's Professor Griff or KRS-One or the real Rick Ross, all these people will sit there and speak out against it, shaming its government run to wreck communities.
[00:42:39.262 --> 00:42:40.103]  That's a fact!
[00:42:40.783 --> 00:42:44.427]  And I've talked to not one, not two, but more than two
[00:42:45.785 --> 00:42:58.954]  Top executives that were in record companies, are in record companies, at MTV, major rock stars, you name it, that were in the room in the early 90s when they said, rock and rolls out.
[00:43:00.355 --> 00:43:04.458]  The CIA doesn't think it's destabilizing things enough because they tried to hijack that.
[00:43:04.498 --> 00:43:05.438]  That's been declassified.
[00:43:05.458 --> 00:43:08.160]  It's like they had ugly art put out to confuse people.
[00:43:09.541 --> 00:43:11.202]  That was declassified last year.
[00:43:11.262 --> 00:43:11.963]  We already knew that.
[00:43:13.100 --> 00:43:17.102]  They said, we're going to put out the most sickening gangster rap you can imagine.
[00:43:17.502 --> 00:43:18.403]  It's going to be king.
[00:43:18.783 --> 00:43:24.205]  And it was force-fed by Sumner Redstone and Viacom.
[00:43:24.225 --> 00:43:26.386]  The tip of the spear.
[00:43:27.247 --> 00:43:34.730]  So that's why I attack it, because it is the weapons system, just like Rick Ross talked about a few months ago when he was here in studio.
[00:43:34.810 --> 00:43:38.492]  The real Rick Ross, who's going to be back in town coming up in a few weeks.
[00:43:38.752 --> 00:43:42.074]  The fake Rick Ross did respond, and I never talked about this a month ago,
[00:43:43.672 --> 00:43:46.514]  in a video and said that, uh, you know what?
[00:43:46.654 --> 00:43:47.655]  I'm not responding.
[00:43:47.675 --> 00:43:52.759]  When he was asked on a TV show, I'm not responding to that Rick Ross.
[00:43:53.359 --> 00:43:53.519]  Why?
[00:43:53.559 --> 00:43:55.381]  That guy was a snitch in prison.
[00:43:56.081 --> 00:44:00.905]  Well, number one, the real Rick Ross was not a snitch in prison, had to stay in there 25 years.
[00:44:02.266 --> 00:44:08.070]  Number two, he's been speaking out from prison against the drug war and apologizing and talking about the CIA and drug dealing.
[00:44:09.889 --> 00:44:35.684]  But number three, it was the fake Rick Ross that was a big fat jail guard at a federal prison, over black people mainly it turns out, who went and created this fake persona, and then says he's this big drug dealer Mac G. Roller, and then steals somebody's identity, and then has the nerve to then sit there and claim that person's a snitch,
[00:44:37.605 --> 00:44:39.967]  When the fake Rick Ross is the Judas goat.
[00:44:40.227 --> 00:44:41.208]  You know what a Judas goat is?
[00:44:42.830 --> 00:44:56.982]  It's the ram, the billy goat, that leads the other billy goats, or in the case, the male sheep, if it's sheep you're talking about, not goats, that leads them into the slaughterhouse and he goes out the other end safe.
[00:44:58.123 --> 00:45:01.726]  And Rick Ross is the worst of the worst.
[00:45:01.766 --> 00:45:05.229]  He's a George Soros in my book, selling out his own people.
[00:45:09.531 --> 00:45:10.171]  But it doesn't matter.
[00:45:10.472 --> 00:45:13.333]  People that are insecure, have nothing, have their culture destroyed.
[00:45:13.353 --> 00:45:15.335]  That's all of us, basically.
[00:45:15.675 --> 00:45:16.936]  That's what they'd like us all to be.
[00:45:18.316 --> 00:45:20.418]  See, fake confidence is everything.
[00:45:22.439 --> 00:45:33.606]  You'll see beautiful, beautiful women with the biggest loser, with no money, no looks, no success, but they know how to act confident around women.
[00:45:36.963 --> 00:45:51.450]  And the women, if they're stupid, and the average person is stupid in America now, uninformed, buy into it because they just keep believing it's gotta deliver as long as the person acts confident versus being confident.
[00:45:54.082 --> 00:45:59.504]  A really confident person is not overconfident and pushy with people that aren't in their face.
[00:46:00.204 --> 00:46:07.327]  A real confident person wants to build other people up, wants to build a better world, and only pulls the knife out when you need to.
[00:46:08.847 --> 00:46:09.968]  And then you use it.
[00:46:10.868 --> 00:46:12.709]  When I talk about a knife, I mean that figuratively.
[00:46:13.889 --> 00:46:17.731]  The average college freshman now reads at a 7th grade level.
[00:46:17.751 --> 00:46:20.792]  That's from campus reform.
[00:46:22.861 --> 00:46:29.306]  That's a mission complete type operation, but we can still resuscitate humanity.
[00:46:30.466 --> 00:46:34.329]  I've got some other clips here, but it turns out that their training is linked to ISIS.
[00:46:34.489 --> 00:46:35.550]  ISIS is giving the orders.
[00:46:36.050 --> 00:46:36.631]  There you go.
[00:46:36.651 --> 00:46:37.812]  What do you have to say about that?

[00:49:00.606 --> 00:49:01.706]  I say next Wednesday.
[00:49:03.207 --> 00:49:10.011]  It looks like the methylcobalamin vitamin B12 may sell out by next Wednesday or Thursday.
[00:49:10.031 --> 00:49:14.373]  We've got projections on the graph we have with our in stock
[00:49:16.522 --> 00:49:20.743]  So it looks like we should be out of that by next Wednesday, maybe a week or two till more gets in.
[00:49:20.783 --> 00:49:24.124]  But regardless, there's a lot of other great products on the site.
[00:49:24.485 --> 00:49:34.608]  The Fluoride Shield, the Lung Cleanse, the super high quality Colloidal Silver, Silver Bullet, and all of your purchases again make the broadcast possible.

[00:49:53.528 --> 00:49:54.268]  PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:49:57.203 --> 00:49:59.605]  $5.95 a month or $29.95 a year.
[00:49:59.686 --> 00:50:03.310]  That's almost half off the yearly price when you sign up right now.
[00:50:03.330 --> 00:50:08.195]  That's basically 7 months free, $2.50 a month and share it with 20 friends.
[00:50:08.235 --> 00:50:08.856]  That's the key.
[00:50:08.876 --> 00:50:11.559]  12 cents per month per user.
[00:50:11.579 --> 00:50:14.382]  20 people can use your membership.
[00:50:15.984 --> 00:50:17.566]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:50:17.626 --> 00:50:19.187]  I want to ask you all to go there today.
[00:50:19.227 --> 00:50:20.629]  If you're not a member, become a member.
[00:50:20.649 --> 00:50:23.011]  If you are a member, share that membership.
[00:50:23.351 --> 00:50:31.139]  Your goal is to get it maxed out, where when you try to log on to watch the nightly news at 7 o'clock central, you can't log on because 20 people are using it.
[00:50:31.399 --> 00:50:32.100]  Hallelujah!

[00:50:53.621 --> 00:50:55.342]  And call those local sponsors and thank them.
[00:50:55.603 --> 00:50:59.545]  Or if you're a local business, call right now and say, I want to talk to a salesperson.
[00:50:59.965 --> 00:51:03.908]  I want to become a sponsor of the Alex Jones Show on this station.
[00:51:04.488 --> 00:51:05.629]  God bless our stations.
[00:51:05.649 --> 00:51:06.249]  Pray for them.
[00:51:06.630 --> 00:51:07.270]  They're growing.
[00:51:07.430 --> 00:51:08.591]  We're reaching millions a day.
[00:51:08.911 --> 00:51:10.012]  Your calls are coming up.

[00:51:40.361 --> 00:51:42.222]  Mom, I can't do my math homework.
[00:51:42.422 --> 00:51:43.482]  I just don't get it.
[00:51:43.822 --> 00:51:44.723]  I hate math.
[00:51:45.310 --> 00:51:49.411]  I've always tried to be a good mother, but when it came to Jamie's math, I was at a loss.
[00:51:49.691 --> 00:51:52.311]  Then a friend told me about Math Made Easy DVDs.
[00:51:52.531 --> 00:51:55.732]  Concepts are simplified in an easy way to follow and review.
[00:51:55.972 --> 00:51:58.953]  And students can learn at their own pace in the convenience of home.
[00:51:59.213 --> 00:52:00.593]  Listen in the frustration.
[00:52:00.753 --> 00:52:01.773]  Call Math Made Easy.

[00:52:09.997 --> 00:52:14.861]  Did you know by age 50, half of all men have an enlarged prostate?
[00:52:15.321 --> 00:52:21.726]  This means more urges to urinate, longer bathroom trips, waking at night to urinate, or issues with sex.
[00:52:22.187 --> 00:52:29.272]  If this sounds familiar, call us now, because we're shipping free bottles of Super Beta Prostate to listeners of this station.

[00:52:53.689 --> 00:52:57.552]  This Super Beta Prostate free offer is for listeners of this station.
[00:52:57.932 --> 00:52:59.033]  But it won't last.

[00:53:01.074 --> 00:53:01.235]  Call 1-800-852-1820.
[00:53:09.700 --> 00:53:10.941]  I love a dark house.
[00:53:11.321 --> 00:53:13.762]  Inside is all the stuff you work so hard for.
[00:53:13.782 --> 00:53:15.743]  And I'm gonna rob you blind.
[00:53:16.143 --> 00:53:18.164]  Don't be the next victim of a break-in.
[00:53:18.224 --> 00:53:26.648]  Go to Faketv.com and discover a device that creates the illusion someone is inside watching TV and makes your home unappealing to would-be thieves.

[00:53:28.248 --> 00:53:31.050]  Starting at $24.95 and there's free shipping.
[00:53:31.330 --> 00:53:35.832]  Go to Faketv.com or ask for it at your local hardware store.
[00:53:35.852 --> 00:53:36.932]  Faketv.
[00:53:37.132 --> 00:53:38.293]  The Burglar Deterrent.
[00:53:39.258 --> 00:53:40.538]  Hey, sorry I'm running late.
[00:53:40.658 --> 00:53:42.499]  I had to stop and get my vitamins for the month.
[00:53:42.819 --> 00:53:47.520]  I got mine in the mail yesterday from DiscountNutritionShop.com, so I'm here totally on time.
[00:53:48.401 --> 00:53:50.161]  DiscountNutritionShop.com?
[00:53:50.481 --> 00:53:52.802]  Yup, they're a lifesaver in more ways than one.
[00:53:53.042 --> 00:53:57.283]  They have all the nutritional supplements you need, the major brands you know, plus you can save up to 10%.
[00:53:58.263 --> 00:53:59.344]  Write down this number, 888-908-4548.
[00:53:59.364 --> 00:53:59.444]  Huh?
[00:53:59.464 --> 00:54:01.144]  888-908-4548, or just go to DiscountNutritionShop.com.
[00:54:14.696 --> 00:54:18.317]  You look like an angel.
[00:54:18.877 --> 00:54:22.337]  Walk like an angel.
[00:54:22.838 --> 00:54:24.518]  Talk like an angel.
[00:54:25.398 --> 00:54:27.318]  But I got one.
[00:54:28.319 --> 00:54:31.599]  You're the devil.
[00:54:31.699 --> 00:54:33.360]  Oh yes you are.
[00:54:33.380 --> 00:54:40.521]  Well, two of the supposed terrorists over there were weed smokers, petty criminals, and major Mac G's.
[00:54:42.140 --> 00:54:45.002]  And now they want to be, you know, big famous people.
[00:54:45.943 --> 00:54:46.623]  I guess they are.
[00:54:46.703 --> 00:54:47.744]  They fit that M.O.
[00:54:49.326 --> 00:54:50.086]  Or they fit the M.O.
[00:54:50.166 --> 00:54:52.188]  of patsies you would cut out to set up.
[00:54:53.009 --> 00:54:56.592]  NBC News and others declared that two of the shooters had been shot dead.
[00:54:56.992 --> 00:54:59.354]  Now we're told that's not the case and they're after other people.
[00:55:00.395 --> 00:55:03.638]  It just fits the classic textbook cover-up.
[00:55:03.758 --> 00:55:09.543]  But classic textbook cover-ups also fit confused wild goose chases.
[00:55:11.604 --> 00:55:13.085]  It's called the fog of war.
[00:55:13.205 --> 00:55:14.246]  We don't know the truth.
[00:55:14.286 --> 00:55:15.287]  We're still tracking it.
[00:55:15.547 --> 00:55:19.070]  I'm going to go to your phone calls for about a good 45 minutes into the next hour.
[00:55:19.090 --> 00:55:26.637]  Then I'm going to get into all the other news we haven't been getting to in the last day and a half since this broke.
[00:55:27.417 --> 00:55:28.899]  And there is a lot of it.
[00:55:29.119 --> 00:55:30.340]  It's all coming up.
[00:55:31.550 --> 00:55:35.792]  George Soros is urging giving Ukraine 50 billion of aid to foil Russia.
[00:55:36.252 --> 00:55:41.655]  He means giving that to the NGOs that he and Joe Biden's son have set up to give themselves.
[00:55:42.115 --> 00:55:43.596]  Give Ukraine money!
[00:55:43.676 --> 00:55:45.476]  You mean give you money?
[00:55:47.637 --> 00:55:48.458]  That's all coming up.
[00:55:48.498 --> 00:55:50.219]  I've got just stacks of news like that.
[00:55:50.239 --> 00:55:55.341]  I'm going to go to Dan and Alan and Matthew and Tom.
[00:55:55.621 --> 00:55:57.262]  Victor is calling from China.
[00:55:58.891 --> 00:56:05.136]  So we'll get to him next, but right now, Dan is listening on KCXL 1140 AM.
[00:56:05.156 --> 00:56:07.577]  They've also got an FM there in Kansas City.
[00:56:08.038 --> 00:56:09.399]  One of our oldest affiliates.
[00:56:09.439 --> 00:56:12.581]  We've been on there about 16 years, last time I checked.
[00:56:13.001 --> 00:56:14.923]  Dan, thank you for calling today.
[00:56:16.244 --> 00:56:17.164]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:56:17.705 --> 00:56:19.206]  I live in Kansas City, Missouri.
[00:56:19.246 --> 00:56:21.968]  I'm actually from a small town in Illinois.
[00:56:21.988 --> 00:56:25.751]  And when I came to Kansas City, I had culture shock.
[00:56:27.246 --> 00:56:31.128]  Everybody's in long black garbs with covers upon their heads.
[00:56:31.628 --> 00:56:33.589]  I'm not prejudiced.
[00:56:33.649 --> 00:56:34.950]  Everybody has their own beliefs.
[00:56:35.330 --> 00:56:42.994]  No, I know, but if we were in Egypt and suddenly there were girls in miniskirts everywhere, they would freak out.
[00:56:43.014 --> 00:56:45.215]  There's a culture shock and we're not supposed to have that shock.
[00:56:45.436 --> 00:56:49.177]  We're supposed to give up our culture, spit on it, and worship any other culture.
[00:56:49.438 --> 00:56:51.219]  Get with the program and abort a baby.
[00:56:51.699 --> 00:56:52.019]  Today.
[00:56:52.079 --> 00:56:52.399]  Go ahead.
[00:56:52.419 --> 00:56:52.679]  Sorry.
[00:56:53.500 --> 00:56:54.000]  Yeah, you're right.
[00:56:54.020 --> 00:56:54.520]  You're right, Alex.
[00:56:56.204 --> 00:57:02.390]  This world is ruled by the devil himself and the people that do the acts that they do are controlled by him.
[00:57:02.410 --> 00:57:09.076]  I'm really compelled to say this, that we should pray for our leaders and pray for all that they wake up.
[00:57:10.157 --> 00:57:13.000]  But on the other side, you're right, we must resist.
[00:57:18.139 --> 00:57:22.240]  I agree with you, but instead of me interrupting you and changing the flow, go back to what you're seeing.
[00:57:22.260 --> 00:57:29.143]  Because for those that don't know, the borders are completely wide open to basically anybody from a third world country that wants to come here.
[00:57:29.523 --> 00:57:34.665]  And they're flooding the Midwest, you name it, with folks from the Middle East.
[00:57:34.925 --> 00:57:35.525]  What are you seeing?
[00:57:36.496 --> 00:57:40.338]  Well, see, I'm actually Mexican and German, so I kind of grew up in both heritages.
[00:57:40.598 --> 00:57:44.140]  I'm born and raised in Wisconsin, in Milwaukee.
[00:57:45.421 --> 00:57:47.702]  Well, I actually went to a Hispanic church before.
[00:57:47.862 --> 00:57:53.625]  I've been in a few of them, but I found that I had to leave the Hispanic church because nobody spoke English.
[00:57:55.038 --> 00:57:55.358]  Really?
[00:57:56.038 --> 00:58:13.025]  So, yeah, yeah, so for months my brain was just dead and nobody would try to try to converse with I think everybody was coming from Honduras and other places and beautiful people but the calls and the things that they're taught about you is that you're a bad guy and they're in church.
[00:58:13.486 --> 00:58:18.888]  Okay, so it's, you know, we're living in a blinded world.
[00:58:19.088 --> 00:58:19.868]  Are you sure?
[00:58:19.908 --> 00:58:21.429]  Who are they being taught is bad?
[00:58:22.768 --> 00:58:23.128]  You are!
[00:58:23.148 --> 00:58:30.814]  I was talking to one brother from church, and I was saying, you know, he's over here, oh yeah, he doesn't know, he's got a few people, he doesn't know what he's talking about.
[00:58:30.834 --> 00:58:33.656]  And it's just, they just don't understand.
[00:58:33.676 --> 00:58:36.358]  Some people will see, some people won't see.
[00:58:36.938 --> 00:58:39.920]  Well brother, just keep spreading the word and they'll understand the bigger picture.
[00:58:40.540 --> 00:58:48.706]  That's what this is all about, it's just, they don't want to bring us all together in a melting pot, they want to get us all together killing each other while the globalists rule over us.
[00:58:49.006 --> 00:58:49.507]  Stay with us.
[00:58:50.167 --> 00:58:51.008]  Second hour coming up.
[00:58:52.166 --> 00:58:54.053]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:55.598 --> 00:58:57.787]  Visit GCNlive.com today.

[01:00:28.780 --> 01:00:32.841]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:36.098 --> 01:00:47.346]  Coming up in the next segment, your phone calls, news and more, and a flashback of the White House condemning Charlie Hebdo, the newspaper that was attacked yesterday in Paris.
[01:00:48.867 --> 01:00:50.048]  Now they're praising it.
[01:00:51.609 --> 01:00:56.573]  This from the White House that arrested the maker of the film, critical of the Prophet Muhammad.
[01:00:58.234 --> 01:01:00.436]  Talk about playing both sides of the fence.
[01:01:01.778 --> 01:01:06.680]  Right now, let's go to Victor in China, then Alan, Matthew, Tom, Karen, and others.
[01:01:07.240 --> 01:01:09.001]  Victor, welcome to the Airwaves.
[01:01:10.061 --> 01:01:10.901]  Hey, Alex.
[01:01:11.602 --> 01:01:11.902]  Hey, brother.
[01:01:11.922 --> 01:01:12.242]  How are you?
[01:01:12.502 --> 01:01:12.742]  Good.
[01:01:15.583 --> 01:01:24.046]  So, you know, I saw a photo online on Getty Images of a shell casing from the attack in Paris.
[01:01:24.648 --> 01:01:26.650]  I can't get a high enough resolution photo of it.
[01:01:26.670 --> 01:01:31.474]  I was wondering if you guys would be able to have a look at that and see what kind of round that really was.
[01:01:31.554 --> 01:01:39.101]  Well, it looked like they were using 7.6239 or Warsaw ammo that's used in the Kalashnikov.
[01:01:40.822 --> 01:01:45.567]  Yeah, there's actually a photo of a shell casing on the ground next to a police bicycle that got hit by a car.
[01:01:45.607 --> 01:01:51.612]  The bicycle kind of crumpled and there's like a chalked out circle around a shell casing on the ground.
[01:01:52.765 --> 01:01:55.328]  I can't get a big enough resolution picture of it.
[01:01:55.348 --> 01:01:59.973]  I don't have that photo in front of me, but it might be a police officer's casing as well.
[01:02:00.574 --> 01:02:02.076]  Does it look like a rifle casing?
[01:02:03.818 --> 01:02:04.519]  I can't tell.
[01:02:05.300 --> 01:02:09.285]  It doesn't look like a 7.62 rifle casing.
[01:02:11.547 --> 01:02:21.973]  Well, you know, the police were in a shootout with him, so it's not what the... I believe the French police basically used something like a 9mm, but I'd have to check.
[01:02:25.595 --> 01:02:27.677]  Are you bringing this up just as a point of investigation?
[01:02:29.898 --> 01:02:40.184]  Yeah, well, you know, otherwise I'm just calling, you know, I used to live in Paris, and now I live in Beijing, China, and I was just talking to some of my Chinese and French friends about this, and
[01:02:40.896 --> 01:02:56.201]  I seem to have the outlier opinion here and I have been called like a conspiracy theorist because I keep telling everybody you have to look at Operation Gladio before you start talking about what happened at Charlie Hebdo.
[01:02:56.301 --> 01:03:10.026]  Well that's right, Jakari Jackson covered that last night and did a great job on the nightly news when I watched it, getting into the fact that there were stay-behind networks in Europe by NATO to stage terror attacks to blame it on their political enemies.
[01:03:11.052 --> 01:03:15.933]  And that's been partially declassified in Italy and in France, as well as the United States.
[01:03:15.993 --> 01:03:19.995]  I made a film about it that I mentioned earlier, Terror Storm, but I'm glad you raised that.
[01:03:20.595 --> 01:03:22.355]  Great points, Victor, there in China.
[01:03:23.276 --> 01:03:25.156]  Let's talk to Alan in Florida.
[01:03:25.176 --> 01:03:25.776]  Go ahead, Alan.
[01:03:27.577 --> 01:03:28.237]  Hi.
[01:03:28.617 --> 01:03:40.841]  Kurt Richard Haskell, who was a passenger on the Underwear Bomber flight, and he's been on your show, posted last night on his Facebook page a breakdown of all the reasons
[01:03:41.961 --> 01:03:45.545]  He thinks that this Paris operation was a false flag.
[01:03:45.585 --> 01:03:46.807]  He goes through all the reasons.
[01:03:47.027 --> 01:03:48.068]  Well, he's a smart lawyer.
[01:03:48.148 --> 01:03:53.754]  We ought to try to get him on tomorrow to get his take on why he thinks that because I respect Kurt Haskell.
[01:03:55.616 --> 01:04:01.603]  I tried to share his Facebook post about an hour ago and was blocked by Facebook.
[01:04:02.228 --> 01:04:07.072]  I went ahead and copied his Facebook post and emailed it to you at Showtips.
[01:04:07.572 --> 01:04:09.134]  Sure, you're talking about Richard Haskell.
[01:04:09.414 --> 01:04:11.195]  Guys, he's a credible person.
[01:04:11.235 --> 01:04:13.177]  He and his wife are lawyers, successful lawyers.
[01:04:13.777 --> 01:04:16.059]  They caught the government getting the underwear bomber on the plane.
[01:04:16.099 --> 01:04:20.043]  It was confirmed a month and a half later on C-SPAN by Congress in testimony.
[01:04:20.063 --> 01:04:26.648]  So I want to take his blog post, since it's getting censored, because I know Facebook does that, and I want to post it in full.
[01:04:31.121 --> 01:04:36.124]  With the headline that he has on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:04:36.464 --> 01:04:38.385]  What is the current headline he has on that?
[01:04:41.446 --> 01:04:49.451]  The post is, he just starts by saying, I have to comment about the Paris attack this morning.
[01:04:49.611 --> 01:04:51.872]  Alright, I would just say terrorist survivors
[01:04:54.328 --> 01:05:05.296]  You know, questions a Paris shooting, or Kurt Haskell, or Terror Survivor questions Paris attack narrative, something like that.
[01:05:05.636 --> 01:05:07.378]  And then we'll get him on the broadcast.
[01:05:07.418 --> 01:05:08.198]  Thanks for bringing that up.
[01:05:08.518 --> 01:05:10.120]  Matthew, Tom, everybody stay there.
[01:05:10.968 --> 01:05:13.531]  Every year we make resolutions to lose weight and get in shape.
[01:05:13.651 --> 01:05:14.792]  And the truth is, it's hard.
[01:05:15.072 --> 01:05:16.533]  Even with diet and exercise.
[01:05:16.734 --> 01:05:21.778]  Because of toxic food in our environment that is stressing our bodies more than ever before.
[01:05:21.938 --> 01:05:28.765]  Working with experts in nutrition and biochemistry, I found that super high quality nutraceuticals, in addition to my diet and exercise,
[01:05:29.065 --> 01:05:31.046]  Worthy answers that synergistically worked.
[01:05:31.306 --> 01:05:37.829]  I can see the drastic changes every day with the amount of weight I've lost, my increased stamina, and more of a twinkle in my eye.
[01:05:38.129 --> 01:05:44.032]  That's why we are now so excited to launch the InfoWars Life Resolution Pack, combining three essential formulations.

[01:06:40.865 --> 01:06:44.366]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[01:06:44.527 --> 01:06:48.488]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[01:06:48.808 --> 01:06:50.269]  Can you put two and two together?
[01:06:50.589 --> 01:06:58.152]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[01:06:58.452 --> 01:06:59.273]  But for how long?

[01:07:01.794 --> 01:07:05.816]  Spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[01:07:06.216 --> 01:07:07.396]  Infidel Body Armor.
[01:07:08.096 --> 01:07:09.037]  Just won't quit.
[01:07:10.632 --> 01:07:21.776]  Sold out for weeks through the difficult and extensive proprietary process behind its creation, the exclusive InfoWars Life Secret 12 formulation is now back in stock in the last limited shipment of 2014.

[01:07:39.323 --> 01:07:40.504]  No needles, no injections.
[01:07:40.744 --> 01:07:44.786]  Vitamin B12 deficiency is linked to scores of serious problems.
[01:07:45.086 --> 01:07:54.251]  And Secret 12 is a fusion of two organic, proprietary forms of Vitamin B12, bringing you a true nutraceutical quality of Vitamin B12.
[01:07:54.712 --> 01:07:55.072]  Secret 12.

[01:08:01.434 --> 01:08:03.515]  Supplies of Secret 12 are very limited.

[01:08:09.798 --> 01:08:15.360]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:08:15.380 --> 01:08:18.702]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:41.061 --> 01:08:53.530]  The French government has decided to temporarily close their embassies and schools in several Muslim countries after esoterical weekly Charlie Hebdo published cartoons mocking the Prophet Muhammad.
[01:08:53.610 --> 01:08:57.973]  Is the White House concerned that those cartoons might further find the flames in the region?
[01:08:59.542 --> 01:09:08.730]  Well, we are aware that a French magazine published cartoons featuring a figure resembling the Prophet Muhammad, and obviously we have questions about the judgment of publishing something like this.
[01:09:09.731 --> 01:09:15.075]  We know that these images will be deeply offensive to many and have the potential to be inflammatory.
[01:09:16.056 --> 01:09:21.101]  But we've spoken repeatedly about the importance of upholding the freedom of expression that is enshrined in our Constitution.
[01:09:21.121 --> 01:09:23.383]  In other words, we don't question the right
[01:09:25.805 --> 01:09:27.166]  of something like this to be published.
[01:09:27.967 --> 01:09:30.710]  We just question the judgment behind the decision to publish it.
[01:09:30.850 --> 01:09:43.201]  And I think that's our view about the video that was produced in this country and has caused so much offense in the Muslim world.
[01:09:43.462 --> 01:09:49.828]  Now, it has to be said, and I'll say it again, that no matter how offensive
[01:09:51.684 --> 01:09:52.745]  Something like this is.
[01:09:53.025 --> 01:09:55.928]  It is not in any way justification for violence.
[01:09:57.870 --> 01:10:00.413]  Not in any way justification for violence.
[01:10:00.473 --> 01:10:08.581]  That's Carney back in 2012 when they were trying to blame unrest all over the world, not on food prices going up.
[01:10:08.641 --> 01:10:11.203]  That's the main indicator most sociologists believe.
[01:10:11.964 --> 01:10:12.544]  It's well known.
[01:10:13.826 --> 01:10:15.727]  In countries where you spend half your money or more
[01:10:16.693 --> 01:10:18.354]  A discretionary income on food.
[01:10:18.715 --> 01:10:20.916]  When food prices go up, unrest goes up.
[01:10:21.337 --> 01:10:26.100]  That's what caused the destabilization, the Arab Spring, that we've seen the last five years.
[01:10:26.801 --> 01:10:31.805]  You go back three years ago to 2012, it was just an excuse.
[01:10:32.105 --> 01:10:33.826]  Oh, there's a magazine in Paris.
[01:10:34.747 --> 01:10:37.869]  Oh, somebody made a video making fun of the Prophet Muhammad.
[01:10:38.310 --> 01:10:40.451]  Let's go burn down and blow up some churches.
[01:10:42.793 --> 01:10:44.915]  It's an excuse to carry out violence
[01:10:46.226 --> 01:10:49.929]  And the White House was basically condemning the cartoon then.
[01:10:50.549 --> 01:10:58.094]  Now Obama, as you know, has come out and basically defended the publication, condemned the parachutings.
[01:10:58.595 --> 01:11:00.336]  Kerry's talked about how they had courage.
[01:11:00.756 --> 01:11:05.980]  So have all the other major talking heads that had been there criticizing free speech.
[01:11:08.171 --> 01:11:10.712]  Now, if you go to Infowars.com, here are some of the headlines.
[01:11:11.093 --> 01:11:12.173]  Paris shooting.
[01:11:12.633 --> 01:11:15.395]  Official story keeps changing by the second.
[01:11:15.935 --> 01:11:19.377]  Very important rundown in that video report by Jakari Jackson.
[01:11:20.097 --> 01:11:23.439]  Fifteen cartoons from artists responding to Paris shooting.
[01:11:23.479 --> 01:11:27.742]  You've got to go look at these on PrisonPlanet.com and Infowars.com.
[01:11:28.542 --> 01:11:37.487]  The first one shows a person in a t-shirt with the name Charlie Ebdo on it with the head cut off.
[01:11:38.826 --> 01:11:48.970]  But rising like the phoenix, a big tongue is sticking out of the neck, where the head's been chopped off, basically saying that the phoenix will rise again.
[01:11:49.390 --> 01:11:52.632]  My favorite one is the image of three pencils.
[01:11:53.652 --> 01:11:54.713]  Three red pencils.
[01:11:55.233 --> 01:11:58.114]  One on top says yesterday, it's an unbroken pencil.
[01:11:58.514 --> 01:12:00.575]  Today, a broken pencil.
[01:12:01.856 --> 01:12:07.498]  Tomorrow, they sharpen the other end, the broken part, and so now you have two pencils.
[01:12:09.332 --> 01:12:12.561]  Actually, you could sharpen the other broken side and have three pencils.
[01:12:13.102 --> 01:12:16.712]  But it shows how you attack free press, you attack liberty.
[01:12:17.887 --> 01:12:22.130]  Generally, in almost every case, it produces more resistance.
[01:12:22.631 --> 01:12:23.992]  That's why they haven't killed me.
[01:12:24.592 --> 01:12:34.720]  That's why they haven't completely set me up, though they've tried a few times, because they understand that it will only cause more people to focus on what I've covered here on air.
[01:12:35.521 --> 01:12:37.522]  That's the power of the First Amendment.
[01:12:37.922 --> 01:12:41.045]  That's why the pen is mightier than the sword.
[01:12:42.892 --> 01:12:53.485]  There's a bunch of other powerful cartoons as well defending free speech worldwide, not just the First Amendment here in this constitutional republic.
[01:12:53.525 --> 01:12:58.011]  And regardless of what's behind this, whether it's a false flag or not, and I don't know,
[01:13:00.816 --> 01:13:09.978]  Whether it's totally staged, they killed a couple of Patsy's and some unnamed group did this to get more defense contract spending or to invade Yemen or whatever the case may be.
[01:13:10.618 --> 01:13:14.618]  The West did fund ISIS, known as Al Qaeda, for four and a half years.
[01:13:14.658 --> 01:13:16.059]  They did give them the training and the weapons.
[01:13:16.539 --> 01:13:20.979]  ISIS did call days before this attack for attacks in Paris.
[01:13:22.160 --> 01:13:26.160]  And so that's a false flag, even if it was real.
[01:13:26.760 --> 01:13:29.761]  The mothership that launched this attack
[01:13:30.717 --> 01:13:33.520]  was built by the globalists on record.
[01:13:36.142 --> 01:13:43.288]  And as I predicted, shooting attacks in Europe, shooting attacks in the US, airliners to be shot down, now they're saying get ready for that to happen.
[01:13:43.769 --> 01:13:47.792]  You can see this scripted only because the system thinks we're so stupid.
[01:13:48.740 --> 01:13:54.246]  And won't remember that our own power structure helped reconstitute Al-Qaeda.
[01:13:54.546 --> 01:14:08.000]  And when the military got upset two years ago and refused to invade Syria with ground troops and air bombardment, and the military went public and said, this is Al-Qaeda, they changed the name to confuse the public and the military.
[01:14:09.041 --> 01:14:09.982]  It has not worked.
[01:14:12.918 --> 01:14:22.097]  So the good news is the military does know the players, they do understand what's going on, they are not compartmentalized, they are not stupid, and they're hopping mad.
[01:14:25.302 --> 01:14:27.142]  Let's go ahead and race through your phone calls.
[01:14:27.522 --> 01:14:30.423]  Matthew, and then Tom, Phyllis, Aaron, Joan.
[01:14:30.763 --> 01:14:33.904]  When you hear me hang up on somebody, that's your chance to call in 800-259-9231.
[01:14:33.924 --> 01:14:40.765]  And just give me your point, I'm going to move the next person, I want to go to a lot of people.
[01:14:41.305 --> 01:14:44.026]  Matthew in New Jersey, you're on the air, thanks for calling.
[01:14:45.566 --> 01:14:47.807]  Hey Alex, thanks for taking my call, first time caller.
[01:14:49.542 --> 01:14:57.112]  My what I'm calling reference to is actually quite a few things you just touched on with the old, you know, it's pointing to false flags.
[01:14:57.132 --> 01:14:58.514]  You're saying not sure not yet.
[01:14:59.175 --> 01:15:01.398]  But with the first the second call, I think it was a victor.
[01:15:01.739 --> 01:15:03.881]  You mentioned the the 762 millimeter.
[01:15:06.112 --> 01:15:22.707]  Now the whole thing that I keep looking about in that video when I saw it, and I saw it this morning too on YouTube with Jakari Jackson where he's showing the reels going through, you can see that the gunman, as he went by, it really, really appears clearly that he lifted the rifle really quickly and shot the ground.
[01:15:23.087 --> 01:15:25.670]  And you can see the ground hitting with the smoke coming up.
[01:15:26.207 --> 01:15:29.849]  Now, to reference a headshot, I would have to say, look at John F. Kennedy.
[01:15:30.270 --> 01:15:34.932]  His own wife turned around and started picking up his brains and his skull fragments as he was still rocking around.
[01:15:35.353 --> 01:15:37.434]  We don't see that with this headshot shooting.
[01:15:37.914 --> 01:15:40.756]  No, I hear you, but it depends where a bullet goes in.
[01:15:40.776 --> 01:15:49.781]  I mean, I've shot wild hogs, deer, elk, you name it, in the head, and sometimes it goes clean through, and it runs a hundred yards.
[01:15:49.881 --> 01:15:52.023]  Other times, it blows the whole side of the head off.
[01:15:52.671 --> 01:15:56.132]  I mean, I shot a hog one time and about 60% of its head blew off.
[01:15:56.412 --> 01:15:58.933]  The entire side and part of the front all blew out.
[01:15:59.533 --> 01:16:01.154]  No blood, almost no blood.
[01:16:01.554 --> 01:16:04.015]  Everything just emptied out, like unzipped its head.
[01:16:04.675 --> 01:16:07.956]  I've shot a wild hog before and the bullet goes right through it.
[01:16:08.537 --> 01:16:11.478]  And I use a hog example because they've got bigger skulls like humans.
[01:16:12.498 --> 01:16:14.219]  It looks like he fires a couple times.
[01:16:15.219 --> 01:16:17.260]  One time hits the ground, the other hits him in the head.
[01:16:18.560 --> 01:16:25.561]  I mean, look, the government's been caught staging stuff, so I don't blame people for questioning this and saying it may be fake.
[01:16:26.161 --> 01:16:28.002]  I just don't see the evidence yet.
[01:16:28.702 --> 01:16:31.882]  The minute we see it, if it comes out, we will go there.
[01:16:32.523 --> 01:16:39.824]  But again, it's provocateured in that they set up ISIS to begin with and then turned them loose.
[01:16:40.484 --> 01:16:43.805]  Doesn't mean Western governments run them completely.
[01:16:44.365 --> 01:16:45.725]  It's the analogy of dumping
[01:16:46.733 --> 01:16:49.434]  A hundred black widows in your neighbor's bed.
[01:16:51.115 --> 01:16:53.196]  You didn't order the black widows to bite them.
[01:16:53.517 --> 01:17:00.800]  There's a good chance that the black widows are going to hide under the bed, and some of them are going to come out in the night, and you're going to roll over on one, and it's going to bite you.
[01:17:01.941 --> 01:17:05.163]  So, they turn loose enough black widows, you're going to have a problem.
[01:17:05.723 --> 01:17:06.583]  Anything else, Matthew?
[01:17:06.603 --> 01:17:11.466]  No, just the last reference where you just said, Terry, I totally agree with you too, and it's just...
[01:17:12.165 --> 01:17:21.971]  As it just came out too, it's just early this month as it was coming out, coming out of Iraq, the Iraqi officials too are claiming, you know, U.S., you're still dropping supplies to ISIS, you're still dropping supplies.
[01:17:21.991 --> 01:17:30.576]  Yeah, that's in mainstream news that the Iraqi president and others are saying, oh, you did another airdrops to al-Qaeda by accident, right?
[01:17:31.296 --> 01:17:31.916]  To ISIS.
[01:17:32.037 --> 01:17:33.658]  I mean, it's ridiculous.
[01:17:34.098 --> 01:17:34.778]  Thanks for calling.
[01:17:35.739 --> 01:17:40.782]  Yeah, because our own military is getting mad about giving weapons to al-Qaeda, they now tell them, drop weapons in this grid,
[01:17:42.051 --> 01:17:44.433]  And then it's turning out it's ISIS and Al-Qaeda.
[01:17:44.653 --> 01:17:45.814]  I mean, it's sick, folks.
[01:17:46.434 --> 01:17:46.935]  It's sick.
[01:17:48.516 --> 01:17:53.199]  Then Al-Qaeda attacks us, then the government gets to grandstand and take our freedom.
[01:17:53.640 --> 01:17:54.981]  It's a very simple equation.
[01:17:55.681 --> 01:17:57.423]  Tom in New Mexico, thanks for calling.
[01:17:57.463 --> 01:17:57.763]  Welcome.
[01:17:59.605 --> 01:18:03.168]  Alex, let me just make a comment on the ballistics.
[01:18:03.188 --> 01:18:04.449]  This is not what I called for.
[01:18:04.489 --> 01:18:09.153]  I have some very other interesting anomalies I'd like to put in front of you.
[01:18:09.193 --> 01:18:10.394]  Sure, go ahead.
[01:18:10.494 --> 01:18:21.463]  Just as far as the ballistics, if you listen to the soundtrack, there are three shots, five shots from an obviously different caliber, and then the coup de grace.
[01:18:21.944 --> 01:18:25.367]  It's really hard to see, but they both look like AKs.
[01:18:28.037 --> 01:18:29.778]  Uh, there are two different kinds of AKs.
[01:18:29.878 --> 01:18:32.499]  One's an AK-47, which shoots the 7.69x39.
[01:18:32.519 --> 01:18:35.801]  The Soviets also have a smaller one comparable to the M4.
[01:18:35.821 --> 01:18:37.001]  It's even lighter than an M4.
[01:18:37.282 --> 01:18:37.802]  It's a 5.45x39.
[01:18:37.822 --> 01:18:39.303]  It's a hot little round, but it's
[01:18:51.001 --> 01:18:55.425]  Because I was taken by the fact that when he made the shot, there was absolutely no recoil.
[01:18:55.485 --> 01:18:57.326]  I said, ah, there's something wrong there.
[01:18:57.927 --> 01:19:03.731]  But if you've ever fired an AK-47, you should keep getting a little bit of kick.
[01:19:04.372 --> 01:19:09.776]  You know, in my experience, it has a low kick if you just hold the gun hard.
[01:19:09.796 --> 01:19:13.539]  I mean, sure, a lot of folks hold a gun light, so there's going to be recoil.
[01:19:13.559 --> 01:19:18.604]  If you just hold a gun hard, and that's not a technical term, but that's how I hold a gun,
[01:19:20.558 --> 01:19:20.978]  But I don't know.
[01:19:21.039 --> 01:19:25.463]  I mean, I hand fire .50 calibers and don't think there's any kick compared to most guns.
[01:19:25.483 --> 01:19:26.424]  But I hear what you're saying.
[01:19:27.105 --> 01:19:29.287]  I mean, what's your gut tell you about this whole thing?
[01:19:29.307 --> 01:19:35.553]  I mean, looking at it, it looks like it's a couple wannabe jihadis trying to be famous who'd gotten some training.
[01:19:36.274 --> 01:19:38.036]  But the system lies so much, who knows?
[01:19:39.924 --> 01:19:44.686]  That's what I called in for.
[01:19:44.706 --> 01:19:53.110]  The AK-74 at 5 feet is going to punch a very tiny little hole, and I agree with you, there doesn't need to be a large pool of blood.
[01:19:53.510 --> 01:19:55.791]  I just want to make a comment.
[01:19:55.991 --> 01:19:57.272]  This is what I called for.
[01:19:57.292 --> 01:19:59.233]  Stay there, we're going to have you finish up, Tom.
[01:20:00.213 --> 01:20:01.874]  Real quickly when we come back, then Aaron.
[01:20:03.160 --> 01:20:05.540]  Then Phyllis, Joan, Jeff, and others.
[01:20:05.861 --> 01:20:07.721]  First-time callers, I'm Alex Jones.
[01:20:08.021 --> 01:20:09.441]  PrisonPlanet.TV.
[01:20:09.501 --> 01:20:09.981]  Check it out.
[01:20:11.302 --> 01:20:15.662]  Healthy elimination is essential to high energy, a cheerful mood, and prevention of disease.
[01:20:15.763 --> 01:20:20.503]  Some of the founders of our modern holistic health thinking state that disease begins in a toxic colon.
[01:20:20.623 --> 01:20:28.085]  A toxic intestinal tract is the foundation for virtually all degenerative disease, and a clean and well-moving intestinal tract is the foundation of health.
[01:20:28.345 --> 01:20:30.888]  I just want to say that you folks have an amazing product.
[01:20:30.988 --> 01:20:35.372]  I've taken whey protein products for years and I've never noticed results I have with your product.
[01:20:35.452 --> 01:20:38.435]  I've suffered with thoughts of constipation most of my life.
[01:20:38.655 --> 01:20:42.879]  Within a few days of taking One World Whey I noticed a dramatic change.
[01:20:42.979 --> 01:20:46.663]  Also in the past few years I've experienced symptoms associated with diabetes.
[01:20:46.903 --> 01:20:50.326]  I feel horrible when I've had too much sugar and I've been getting the foot pain as well.
[01:20:50.947 --> 01:20:52.408]  Call 888-988-3325 or visit OneWorldWay.com
[01:21:10.362 --> 01:21:12.624]  What good is a Big Berkey water filter?

[01:22:10.074 --> 01:22:12.635]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[01:22:12.895 --> 01:22:17.777]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[01:22:18.038 --> 01:22:25.861]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[01:22:26.141 --> 01:22:30.462]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[01:22:30.662 --> 01:22:34.484]  My Patriot Supply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[01:22:34.644 --> 01:22:40.345]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[01:22:40.585 --> 01:22:43.366]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[01:22:43.746 --> 01:22:48.908]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality storable foods from My Patriot Supply.
[01:22:49.108 --> 01:22:57.236]  Go to MyPatriotsSupply.com forward slash Alex today for special offers on emergency food storage or call their preparedness specialist at 866-229-0927.

[01:23:14.970 --> 01:23:16.411]  Make sure you're not one of them.
[01:23:16.631 --> 01:23:21.153]  Protect yourself with Supernatural Silver, a revolutionary new product.

[01:23:47.485 --> 01:23:51.447]  The Science Digest Journal says, silver is our mightiest germ fighter.
[01:23:51.727 --> 01:23:55.970]  It is virtually non-toxic and is emerging as a wonder of modern medicine.

[01:24:25.921 --> 01:24:27.162]  Alex Jones here, back live.
[01:24:27.803 --> 01:24:30.165]  We have a lot of hardcore guests on the transmission.
[01:24:31.206 --> 01:24:32.708]  One of them is Ahmad Salam.
[01:24:33.228 --> 01:24:36.792]  He'll be with us for his virgin voyage with the Infowar.
[01:24:38.474 --> 01:24:45.001]  In the third hour today, he was the FBI informant, the Egyptian CIA asset.
[01:24:46.058 --> 01:24:54.964]  Who exposed the false flag, tried to stop it, and was successful in recording and proving that the FBI basically allowed it to go forward.
[01:24:57.125 --> 01:25:00.587]  He was able to tape them ordering him to basically let it go forward.
[01:25:00.907 --> 01:25:03.249]  He knew it was a setup and tried to stop it and exposed it.
[01:25:03.769 --> 01:25:05.270]  He will be joining us today.
[01:25:05.290 --> 01:25:06.611]  He wrote the book undercover.
[01:25:07.864 --> 01:25:22.429]  We'll go back over those New York Times articles and more to understand how, when I say something's an inside job, in most cases it doesn't mean Barack Obama is sitting there like Wile E. Coyote with the detonator plunger, pushing down, blowing something up.
[01:25:23.009 --> 01:25:27.211]  It means they just wind up crazies, open the door, and allow them to attack.
[01:25:29.005 --> 01:25:31.767]  But in some cases, they like to have deniability.
[01:25:31.787 --> 01:25:36.449]  They'll use private criminal merc groups, who'll then kill a patsy and frame them.
[01:25:36.789 --> 01:25:39.051]  So there's layer after layer to separate it.
[01:25:39.991 --> 01:25:41.272]  You want to understand how this works?
[01:25:41.772 --> 01:25:43.213]  There's a lot of historical examples.
[01:25:43.633 --> 01:25:44.754]  I've made films covering it.
[01:25:45.194 --> 01:25:49.136]  But a great fiction movie is Mark Wahlberg's, which he was involved in making.
[01:25:49.156 --> 01:25:50.777]  I really respect him as a director.
[01:25:51.437 --> 01:25:52.098]  The Shooter.
[01:25:53.772 --> 01:25:59.095]  You want to see how they do a false flag, that it's incredibly accurate, and what governments really run by?
[01:25:59.495 --> 01:26:01.376]  These combine groups within government?
[01:26:02.477 --> 01:26:03.318]  Watch that movie.
[01:26:03.758 --> 01:26:04.838]  I own no stock in it.
[01:26:05.839 --> 01:26:06.980]  I gotta watch that movie again.
[01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:08.421]  I got shook up.
[01:26:08.481 --> 01:26:09.381]  I didn't see that in the theater.
[01:26:09.421 --> 01:26:15.645]  I saw it the year after it came out on the treadmill, watched it on DVD years ago, and it's just so accurate.
[01:26:15.685 --> 01:26:18.066]  I mean, that is exactly the stuff they pulled.
[01:26:18.807 --> 01:26:19.847]  You want to know how it's done?
[01:26:19.867 --> 01:26:20.668]  That's it.
[01:26:21.570 --> 01:26:38.691]  So it's not corporations, it's not government, it's not... It's networks within, at key points, that'll hire a Merck group, who'll then go out and recruit the patsies, who are the idiots, and then... I mean, if this is a false flag, that's probably what it is, and these guys were dead a long time ago.
[01:26:40.216 --> 01:26:41.177]  But we'll never know.
[01:26:41.277 --> 01:26:41.938]  That's the problem.
[01:26:42.278 --> 01:26:51.027]  It's kind of like all the callers calling in obsessing after one caller called in about, were those AKs 7.6239 or I don't see a recoil.
[01:26:52.008 --> 01:26:53.089]  Who knows, folks?
[01:26:54.050 --> 01:26:54.831]  We'll never know.
[01:26:57.481 --> 01:27:02.724]  I know our government and others helped set up the jihadis that are now running wild in the Middle East.
[01:27:02.884 --> 01:27:04.125]  That's the big enchilada.
[01:27:04.385 --> 01:27:05.306]  That's what's admitted.
[01:27:05.646 --> 01:27:06.987]  We forced that out in the open.
[01:27:07.347 --> 01:27:14.511]  So no matter where it comes from, our governments are illegitimate and stand to gain from it at the expense of our liberty.
[01:27:14.931 --> 01:27:15.852]  I'm sick of it!
[01:27:16.872 --> 01:27:17.773]  Excuse me, I'm ranting.
[01:27:18.133 --> 01:27:19.654]  Tom in New Mexico, finish up, sorry.
[01:27:20.765 --> 01:27:22.606]  Yeah, I didn't mean to be rude.
[01:27:22.646 --> 01:27:24.246]  It's just I've been doing this for a long time.
[01:27:24.266 --> 01:27:25.086]  No, no, no, you're not rude.
[01:27:25.106 --> 01:27:33.209]  I was talking about the caller bringing something up and how it becomes a chain reaction obsessing over the caliber of the gun while the elephant in the room is our government openly credited Al Qaeda.
[01:27:33.249 --> 01:27:33.609]  Go ahead.
[01:27:34.489 --> 01:27:43.372]  Well, I've been doing this a long time and you first have to establish what happened before you try to figure out who and why.
[01:27:43.492 --> 01:27:47.353]  And I'm going to present you some facts and you can deal with it.
[01:27:47.373 --> 01:27:48.273]  Enough preface, brother.
[01:27:48.313 --> 01:27:49.154]  We're running out of time.
[01:27:49.194 --> 01:27:49.514]  Go ahead.
[01:27:50.334 --> 01:27:53.276]  Okay, okay, okay.
[01:27:53.377 --> 01:27:56.299]  These guys were originally bombed on November 2nd, 2011.
[01:27:57.620 --> 01:27:59.661]  When I first researched this, which you gotta do.
[01:27:59.681 --> 01:28:00.842]  You gotta do it in the first hour.
[01:28:00.882 --> 01:28:03.905]  When I first researched, I could find the address.
[01:28:04.105 --> 01:28:05.386]  I forgot the address.
[01:28:05.446 --> 01:28:06.387]  I know the numbers are 6-2.
[01:28:08.587 --> 01:28:09.847]  They moved from there.
[01:28:09.907 --> 01:28:15.889]  Their own website gave a new address of 35 Rue Cherpolet.
[01:28:16.089 --> 01:28:18.710]  S-E-R-P-O-L-L-E-T.
[01:28:19.190 --> 01:28:21.031]  And they even provide a picture.
[01:28:21.051 --> 01:28:22.351]  You can go to Google Maps.
[01:28:22.391 --> 01:28:23.111]  You can find us.
[01:28:23.131 --> 01:28:24.932]  You're talking about the newspaper over in France?
[01:28:25.492 --> 01:28:25.752]  Yes.
[01:28:25.952 --> 01:28:27.113]  Go ahead.
[01:28:27.473 --> 01:28:32.474]  Now all of a sudden, we would know how to get from here to there.
[01:28:33.055 --> 01:28:35.735]  Allegedly, the shooting happens at 10 Rue Nicolas
[01:28:38.771 --> 01:28:40.213]  I'll kill the French.
[01:28:41.133 --> 01:28:59.788]  Now, I don't know how they get there, but you can go to Google Earth on that, take a look at it, and what's very interesting, when you look at that address and you get down the street view, there are two police nationales sitting out there, obviously just hanging out, which I thought was kind of interesting.
[01:29:00.588 --> 01:29:05.272]  But where the shooting allegedly took place, the reason I ran
[01:29:05.922 --> 01:29:18.035]  Could run this down as there was a sign, uh, Pseudodyne Hotel, which is 37, I hope somebody's writing this down, 37... It's been recorded, millions are listening, just get to it, please.
[01:29:18.055 --> 01:29:21.278]  37 Boulevard, Richard, uh, Lenore.
[01:29:21.939 --> 01:29:24.161]  That's where the ambulances are set up.
[01:29:24.762 --> 01:29:27.325]  Now, that is two blocks
[01:29:28.479 --> 01:29:33.181]  Two blocks north, one block west of where the shooting takes place.
[01:29:33.201 --> 01:29:34.742]  500 feet.
[01:29:35.202 --> 01:29:42.145]  Why in the heck are they gurneying people 500 feet to the triage, which is way away?
[01:29:42.185 --> 01:29:44.205]  It just makes no sense at all.
[01:29:44.406 --> 01:29:45.286]  And one other thing,
[01:29:45.856 --> 01:29:51.840]  The cop was shot about a third of a mile away from that location.
[01:29:52.381 --> 01:29:54.242]  Now, I can give you... We're gonna investigate it.
[01:29:54.262 --> 01:29:55.163]  I appreciate your call.
[01:29:55.223 --> 01:29:57.885]  I'm gonna just rampage through calls when we come back.
[01:29:57.985 --> 01:29:58.665]  We'll look into that.
[01:29:58.725 --> 01:29:59.065]  Thank you.
[01:30:00.046 --> 01:30:00.967]  We're on the march.
[01:30:01.447 --> 01:30:03.068]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:30:03.969 --> 01:30:06.651]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:10.794 --> 01:30:17.757]  For all of recorded history, civilizations around the world praised the health benefits of silver.

[01:31:13.430 --> 01:31:14.571]  And the truth is, it's hard.
[01:31:14.832 --> 01:31:16.313]  Even with diet and exercise.
[01:31:16.513 --> 01:31:21.559]  Because of toxic food in our environment that is stressing our bodies more than ever before.
[01:31:21.699 --> 01:31:28.526]  Working with experts in nutrition and biochemistry, I found that super high quality nutraceuticals, in addition to my diet and exercise,
[01:31:28.846 --> 01:31:30.829]  Worthy answers that synergistically worked.

[01:33:22.459 --> 01:33:27.706]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[01:33:31.771 --> 01:33:34.374]  I want you.
[01:33:46.270 --> 01:33:52.353]  Well, the silent killer high fructose corn syrup is being removed from products all over the country and the world.
[01:33:52.373 --> 01:33:54.554]  It's being taken out of thousands of products.
[01:33:55.154 --> 01:33:57.476]  From Heinz Ketchup to Hershey's Chocolate Bars.
[01:33:57.996 --> 01:34:00.978]  So the industry's striking back, just changing the name of it.
[01:34:00.998 --> 01:34:01.999]  I've mentioned that some.
[01:34:02.399 --> 01:34:06.161]  We have a special report with Anthony Gucciardi coming up.
[01:34:06.382 --> 01:34:08.143]  I want to get to a bunch of calls right now.
[01:34:08.523 --> 01:34:11.685]  Ahead of our guest joining us, Aaron in Washington, thanks for holding.
[01:34:12.025 --> 01:34:12.926]  You're on the air.
[01:34:13.807 --> 01:34:16.628]  What's your take on the shooting in France?
[01:34:16.688 --> 01:34:23.793]  False flag or not, we know ISIS has been set up and protected as the new Al-Qaeda by the West.
[01:34:23.873 --> 01:34:24.674]  What do you make of it?
[01:34:26.345 --> 01:34:28.066]  Hi Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[01:34:28.466 --> 01:34:35.451]  My gut instinct tells me Operation Northwood style or Operation Gladio style Patsy's.
[01:34:36.792 --> 01:34:40.475]  In contrast, correction, this is not Washington, this is FEMA Region 10.
[01:34:40.975 --> 01:34:54.064]  Yesterday in the Shoreline School District in the Seattle area, we had a possible sighting of a man with a gun who had an interaction, not a violent interaction, just a conversation with a school district employee.
[01:34:54.588 --> 01:34:59.570]  Who went in and told police what happened, and 14 schools were shut down.
[01:34:59.970 --> 01:35:10.613]  In contrast, in Paris, hours later after the shooting when they're still doing their manhunt, Holland, or I think he's the president, he's over there making a speech.
[01:35:10.673 --> 01:35:17.936]  There doesn't seem to be much, you know, protocol, you know, to keep everybody safe, or, quote, safe.
[01:35:18.316 --> 01:35:21.757]  You know, like how they ran over everybody in Boston and kept them in their homes.
[01:35:23.347 --> 01:35:35.782]  Yeah, that's the Feds doing that, giving the orders to militarize and roll out the police and lock down half the city and drag women out of their homes that look nothing like the suspects as just a raw exercise of power.
[01:35:35.822 --> 01:35:38.706]  And then it didn't even catch the other Patsy.
[01:35:39.246 --> 01:35:41.870]  And the Boston bombing was a Patsy operation.
[01:35:42.270 --> 01:35:47.032]  That's why he's pled not guilty and why they've had the FBI out executing witnesses in their homes.
[01:35:47.432 --> 01:35:48.293]  That's a great point.
[01:35:48.313 --> 01:35:49.413]  Good to hear from you, Aaron.
[01:35:49.853 --> 01:35:50.874]  Phyllis in Georgia.
[01:35:51.174 --> 01:35:54.155]  What I'm getting from the listeners is they don't buy the official story.
[01:35:54.456 --> 01:35:55.616]  They think it's a false flag.
[01:35:56.877 --> 01:36:02.519]  I cannot blame the listeners thinking that because so many false flags have been revealed.
[01:36:03.420 --> 01:36:08.342]  The problem is ISIS itself is the big kahuna false flag.
[01:36:09.164 --> 01:36:23.107]  You shut up 200,000, they now admit that, 200,000 Western-funded fighters, a bunch of Westerners go and join it, it's given weapons by the West, it's going to leak out and start attacking Western countries.
[01:36:24.827 --> 01:36:25.247]  It's clear.
[01:36:26.028 --> 01:36:27.890]  They funded the same group to attack Libya.
[01:36:27.930 --> 01:36:28.631]  They took over there.
[01:36:28.671 --> 01:36:31.814]  They held up signs saying Damascus, Syria is next.
[01:36:32.134 --> 01:36:33.556]  Then they said Baghdad is next.
[01:36:33.996 --> 01:36:39.201]  The signs they're holding up now say Paris and London and New York are next.
[01:36:40.362 --> 01:36:44.586]  And they've got idiot camp followers that watch... Listen, I'm online.
[01:36:44.706 --> 01:36:46.028]  I know real stuff when I see it.
[01:36:47.028 --> 01:36:55.753]  There are real teenagers and young people that are ne'er-do-wells and aimless and have no future and want to be rock stars.
[01:36:55.854 --> 01:37:00.136]  And the way to be a rock star, it's being advertised, is join a jihad.
[01:37:02.057 --> 01:37:02.918]  It's a shake and bake.
[01:37:03.879 --> 01:37:05.860]  They are trying to hype up in the culture.
[01:37:07.682 --> 01:37:16.586]  Young people using their access to the Second Amendment to cause a jihad in this country, which will then be used to restrict the Second Amendment.
[01:37:17.227 --> 01:37:23.890]  The good news is most American Muslim youth are not biting, because the tactics are known and are out there.
[01:37:24.410 --> 01:37:36.716]  So they go to plan B, they try to get young Muslims to be involved in drills, then they set them up in the drill, kill them, have the real operation carried out, and then blame it on a corpse.
[01:37:38.086 --> 01:37:39.347]  And they'll do this with cops.
[01:37:39.467 --> 01:37:40.667]  They'll do it with veterans.
[01:37:41.587 --> 01:37:42.288]  Let me explain something.
[01:37:42.488 --> 01:37:47.050]  When they're done setting up the police state for Muslims, they're going to move on to veterans, patriots.
[01:37:47.270 --> 01:37:48.510]  That's always been the plan.
[01:37:48.791 --> 01:37:49.871]  Now that plan is revealed.
[01:37:50.131 --> 01:37:51.232]  That's why this is so important.
[01:37:52.452 --> 01:37:57.134]  We cannot allow the persecution of Muslims because it's wrong to persecute people.
[01:37:57.354 --> 01:38:04.497]  A. B. When they're done with them, baby, you better believe the patriots the number one enemy of the New World Order.
[01:38:05.097 --> 01:38:06.358]  They're coming for us.
[01:38:08.712 --> 01:38:13.176]  And if they ever set me up and claim I want violence, you know it's bull.
[01:38:13.917 --> 01:38:16.719]  If I ever supposedly commit suicide, they killed me.
[01:38:18.801 --> 01:38:22.044]  I'm gonna be taken out of this world kicking and screaming.
[01:38:22.644 --> 01:38:26.147]  I will have Darth Vader-level procedures done to stay alive.
[01:38:26.708 --> 01:38:27.188]  You understand?
[01:38:27.909 --> 01:38:31.532]  I'm not gonna kill myself, and I'm not gonna offensively go hurt anybody.
[01:38:34.730 --> 01:38:43.876]  Hypothetically, I don't think this would happen, but if some crazy cop, and they've got state law saying I can defend myself, pulled me over with my family, got out and said, I'm going to kill you, I would defend myself.
[01:38:44.036 --> 01:38:45.357]  That's not going to happen.
[01:38:45.517 --> 01:38:46.578]  One chance out of a billion.
[01:38:47.679 --> 01:38:48.399]  But that's it.
[01:38:49.280 --> 01:38:54.784]  I'm not offensively doing jack squat, just like Lexington and Concord.
[01:38:55.084 --> 01:38:56.365]  They didn't pull the trigger first.
[01:38:57.125 --> 01:38:59.267]  But the Redcoats marched up and said, turn your guns in.
[01:39:00.293 --> 01:39:06.199]  And the captain, who was the preacher, he said, I forget his name, we can look up his famous words, recorded by the British as well.
[01:39:06.960 --> 01:39:08.541]  He said, men, we're not looking for trouble.
[01:39:08.561 --> 01:39:09.402]  We don't want a war.
[01:39:09.842 --> 01:39:12.125]  Do not shoot first, as they were marching up, screaming at them.
[01:39:12.465 --> 01:39:14.887]  But if they aim to have a war, it's going to start right here.
[01:39:15.588 --> 01:39:17.650]  They pull the trigger, it starts right here.
[01:39:18.651 --> 01:39:19.532]  And that's where I'm at.
[01:39:20.272 --> 01:39:23.576]  Arm yourself, get ready to defend yourself, prepare.
[01:39:25.478 --> 01:39:30.182]  But 90% of your energy should be trying to save things peacefully, wake people up.
[01:39:34.346 --> 01:39:42.613]  90% of our energy should be on waking up the police, the military, waking up the legislatures, waking up the judges, waking up the media, waking up people in government.
[01:39:42.773 --> 01:39:46.276]  Let me tell you something, I can criticize the CIA and the FBI all day.
[01:39:48.148 --> 01:39:49.408]  But there's a paradox there.
[01:39:50.009 --> 01:39:55.530]  I can criticize federal marshals and Secret Service and cops all day until you get out there in the real world.
[01:39:55.550 --> 01:39:59.392]  Let me give you a little newsflash, because I've experienced it in 20 years on air.
[01:40:02.913 --> 01:40:11.336]  I was so naive that when the FBI would give me restricted documents and things back in the late 90s, I thought it was set up
[01:40:13.035 --> 01:40:18.658]  And that it wasn't real until years later it was declassified and I was given real documents by good people.
[01:40:20.559 --> 01:40:21.680]  That's how naive I was.
[01:40:21.920 --> 01:40:23.261]  I just thought, all bad!
[01:40:23.621 --> 01:40:24.101]  All bad!
[01:40:24.401 --> 01:40:24.822]  All bad!
[01:40:25.522 --> 01:40:26.943]  That's not how it works, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:40:29.124 --> 01:40:32.186]  Even if somebody isn't bad, I knew the system's bad, so I counted them as bad.
[01:40:32.486 --> 01:40:33.487]  That's how they want us to think.
[01:40:35.147 --> 01:40:37.589]  The people in the government are more awake than we are.
[01:40:37.749 --> 01:40:39.210]  Who do you think William Benny is?
[01:40:40.273 --> 01:40:42.598]  One of the top code breakers in history.
[01:40:43.280 --> 01:40:43.761]  On record.
[01:40:44.302 --> 01:40:46.466]  The head of a major NSA division.
[01:40:46.727 --> 01:40:48.491]  Number four in the NSA.
[01:40:49.172 --> 01:40:49.834]  He went public.
[01:40:52.967 --> 01:40:57.828]  You need to understand, compared to the public, people in the government are more awake than the public.
[01:40:58.048 --> 01:40:59.529]  It's easy to hate the government all day.
[01:40:59.889 --> 01:41:00.769]  I'm not anti-government.
[01:41:01.069 --> 01:41:02.670]  I'm anti-tyranny in government.
[01:41:03.190 --> 01:41:06.291]  And believe me, people in government are the ones under a thumb.
[01:41:06.511 --> 01:41:08.211]  They're the ones being persecuted.
[01:41:08.371 --> 01:41:11.812]  They're the ones being surveilled and pushed around to not expose the tyranny.
[01:41:12.053 --> 01:41:13.593]  They're the ones being witch-hunted.
[01:41:14.173 --> 01:41:17.434]  They're the ones ready to work with us to restore the republic.
[01:41:17.734 --> 01:41:19.595]  That's why the globalists want to start a civil war!
[01:41:20.535 --> 01:41:25.597]  With terror attacks to get a shooting war going before we fix things peacefully!
[01:41:25.617 --> 01:41:27.838]  Do you understand that?
[01:41:29.119 --> 01:41:32.300]  That's why they're busy trying to get militias to blow stuff up all over the country.
[01:41:33.100 --> 01:41:35.861]  Criminal elements of the FBI, BATF and others.
[01:41:36.001 --> 01:41:38.603]  But it's not working because you know what happens?
[01:41:39.143 --> 01:41:40.083]  It gets leaked.
[01:41:41.604 --> 01:41:44.765]  Whenever the FBI is trying to do that or the BATF.
[01:41:45.045 --> 01:41:46.506]  And do you know who's leaking it?
[01:41:47.472 --> 01:41:55.639]  The BATF and the FBI, we have achieved victory-level saturation of the truth in the system.
[01:41:57.020 --> 01:42:05.707]  You may have some go-along, get-along people in these agencies, but they, most of them, don't want to overtly overthrow the country and sell out their own children.
[01:42:06.008 --> 01:42:07.649]  They now know what the New Old Order means.
[01:42:10.992 --> 01:42:14.375]  So that's why I go off on this jag about not being offensively violent.
[01:42:15.205 --> 01:42:17.786]  That is exactly what the system wants.
[01:42:18.406 --> 01:42:22.247]  But yeah, they're marching down the street with the military doing gun confiscation on the general public.
[01:42:23.247 --> 01:42:23.887]  It's gonna start.
[01:42:24.867 --> 01:42:31.128]  And I'm not looking for it, I'm not asking for it, but if there's gonna be a war, it'll start there, on that day.
[01:42:33.269 --> 01:42:42.791]  And then I will be very sad because it'll be the police and the military that take the brunt of this civil war that will look like the most violent civil war of history, times two.
[01:42:46.553 --> 01:42:51.496]  Because people like George Soros will sit it out in Switzerland laughing at the dumb Yanks.
[01:42:51.936 --> 01:42:53.436]  And that's what he calls Americans, Yanks.
[01:42:55.578 --> 01:43:02.881]  A known Nazi collaborator that has his agents crawling all over my operation right now.
[01:43:05.803 --> 01:43:07.123]  Think, I've talked about this many times.
[01:43:08.464 --> 01:43:16.028]  It really sticks in my craw that both my grandfathers served this country in World War II and both almost died.
[01:43:17.085 --> 01:43:18.025]  In the Army Air Corps.
[01:43:20.686 --> 01:43:21.966]  And they've been dead a long time.
[01:43:22.087 --> 01:43:24.647]  One of them 11 years, one of them more than 20 years.
[01:43:24.987 --> 01:43:26.688]  They were great, good, hard-working men.
[01:43:27.828 --> 01:43:44.213]  And a Nazi collaborator basically runs this country and gets awards from the ADL and has his organizations all over the place trying to make stuff up and digging into what I'm up to and sending their people in and trying to mess with our operation.
[01:43:44.233 --> 01:43:46.274]  It's just, it's not right!
[01:43:47.560 --> 01:43:48.420]  It's not right!
[01:43:49.120 --> 01:43:51.281]  That this country's so overrun with scum!
[01:43:54.142 --> 01:43:55.102]  They're a bunch of filth!
[01:43:56.463 --> 01:43:57.243]  I'm sick of it!
[01:43:58.663 --> 01:44:06.525]  And I don't want to see a race war start, I don't want to see a war on the police start, because it's coming out of the New World Order, and it's meant to burn this country down!
[01:44:07.646 --> 01:44:12.487]  But you know, this country is so immoral on average, and so evil, I don't know if we have any hope sometimes.
[01:44:12.827 --> 01:44:15.288]  But then there's so many good people as well, it's a paradox.
[01:44:16.598 --> 01:44:17.859]  And I've now gone off on a jag.
[01:44:17.879 --> 01:44:21.762]  I'm gonna skip this network break, but I gotta quit skipping or it'll bankrupt the show.
[01:44:21.802 --> 01:44:22.643]  I skipped so many now.
[01:44:24.364 --> 01:44:25.825]  It's not even really a radio show, folks.
[01:44:25.885 --> 01:44:30.488]  It's just an emergency beacon, where I'm here just trying to shake people out of their doldrums, out of their trance.
[01:44:30.508 --> 01:44:31.249]  This is so real.
[01:44:31.509 --> 01:44:40.756]  And I'll come back to Phyllis, Joan, Jeff, Genovieve, is that right?
[01:44:42.638 --> 01:44:44.359]  Giovanni, a bunch of other people.
[01:44:46.641 --> 01:44:48.001]  This is something we can do something about.
[01:44:48.041 --> 01:44:49.282]  We can do something about GMO.
[01:44:49.302 --> 01:44:50.542]  We can do something about vaccines.
[01:44:50.562 --> 01:44:52.402]  We can do something about high fructose corn syrup.
[01:44:52.722 --> 01:44:55.743]  We can do something about their attacks, at least at that level.
[01:44:55.803 --> 01:44:59.024]  We can take control of so much in our own daily lives.
[01:45:01.304 --> 01:45:07.326]  Let's go ahead and go to this special report from last night's Nightly News with Anthony Gucciardi and others.
[01:45:07.366 --> 01:45:08.766]  It's a very important report.
[01:45:09.066 --> 01:45:10.887]  We've tweeted it out at Real Alex Jones.
[01:45:11.247 --> 01:45:12.547]  We've posted it on Facebook.
[01:45:13.987 --> 01:45:15.888]  In fact, we'll put it up on screen and I'll give you the
[01:45:18.356 --> 01:45:22.421]  The title of it, Poison Makeover.
[01:45:24.284 --> 01:45:25.986]  Poison Makeover.
[01:45:26.987 --> 01:45:32.234]  And you can go to our Facebook and to our Twitter and you can get the report.
[01:45:32.274 --> 01:45:35.559]  It's named High Fructose, the Secret Killer of the Masses.
[01:45:36.892 --> 01:45:43.457]  And I think that's an important headline, but it probably needs to be Consumer Alert High Fructose Corn Syrup Name Changed.
[01:45:44.077 --> 01:45:48.761]  This is really a consumer alert here, because we're winning this war, so the enemy's pulling a fast one.
[01:45:48.781 --> 01:45:49.862]  Let's go to this report.
[01:45:51.032 --> 01:45:59.623]  For years, mega food manufacturers have told us to not look at the label or the ingredients of your product and that high fructose corn syrup is perfectly safe.
[01:45:59.683 --> 01:46:01.065]  It's the same as sugar.
[01:46:01.266 --> 01:46:04.370]  You shouldn't even care, in fact, if you're eating regular sugar from fruit.
[01:46:04.670 --> 01:46:07.113]  Then high fructose corn syrup is the same thing.
[01:46:07.754 --> 01:46:22.022]  But unfortunately for them, and fortunately for humanity, due to some recent studies I'm about to reveal to you, we have been looking, and we have been concerned, because we don't want to eat garbage, and we don't want to feed our family mercury-laden, high-fructose corn syrup.
[01:46:22.103 --> 01:46:25.805]  And yes, it does contain mercury, as the Washington Post has shown.
[01:46:26.405 --> 01:46:35.172]  Specifically now, the corporations have lost the battle to such a degree that they're giving up and renaming high fructose corn syrup.
[01:46:35.552 --> 01:46:44.439]  So no longer are you even allowed to know, just like GMOs from Monsanto and other biotech industries, if you're eating high fructose corn syrup.
[01:46:44.800 --> 01:46:52.726]  They've gone now, and according to the Corn Growers Association, they have literally changed high fructose corn syrup just to fructose.
[01:46:53.206 --> 01:46:55.267]  And how do they possibly get away with that?
[01:46:55.307 --> 01:46:57.648]  They just say, well, it's the same thing.
[01:46:57.968 --> 01:46:59.409]  There's nothing wrong with that.
[01:47:00.009 --> 01:47:03.250]  And this is actually a quote from the Corn Growers Association.
[01:47:03.791 --> 01:47:15.116]  They say that the term fructose is now being used to denote a product that was previously known as high fructose corn syrup 90, meaning it's 90% pure fructose.
[01:47:15.496 --> 01:47:20.358]  Compare this to what is now termed the regular high fructose corn syrup, which contains either 42 or 55% fructose.
[01:47:22.679 --> 01:47:26.580]  And you'll easily know why General Mills and others are so eager to keep you in the dark.
[01:47:27.220 --> 01:47:35.082]  Now, specifically what we're saying here is that they're changing high fructose corn syrup to a less scary name, just regular fructose sugar.
[01:47:35.162 --> 01:47:36.203]  It's totally safe.
[01:47:36.763 --> 01:47:40.944]  The Washington Post, however, and other mainstream news outlets disagree.
[01:47:41.844 --> 01:48:01.181]  Let's look specifically here when it was found that high fructose corn syrup not only is it unhealthy and there's a new study explaining exactly why and how it's actually killing you and harming your reproduction and shortening your life, but specifically how it's contaminated with one of the most toxic, if not the most toxic substances in the known world.
[01:48:01.781 --> 01:48:05.265]  Specifically here, we can look at the Washington Post article from 2009, where it says,
[01:48:21.744 --> 01:48:23.685]  This is according to two new studies.
[01:48:24.245 --> 01:48:26.786]  Now, specifically, they went to the store shelves.
[01:48:26.846 --> 01:48:28.427]  This wasn't some scam system.
[01:48:28.447 --> 01:48:31.848]  This was an independent actual analysis, and that's why we see real results.
[01:48:32.188 --> 01:48:37.970]  We don't see these things when Monsanto or major food corporations fund these studies to say that it's perfectly safe.
[01:48:38.030 --> 01:48:49.095]  And you've seen the commercials on television, on YouTube, when the ads play before the video, where they're feeding their families the ice cream and the cookies, and it says, high fructose corn syrup is so safe, it's the same as sugar.
[01:48:49.835 --> 01:48:55.840]  Well, as it turns out, they all actually contain these major brand names, about a third of them, and they only tested about 55.
[01:48:56.460 --> 01:49:00.544]  You can imagine about 90% of them, though, I would say, actually contain some form of contamination.
[01:49:00.904 --> 01:49:05.388]  Maybe not mercury, but they all contained mercury in levels that were actually harmful.
[01:49:06.449 --> 01:49:09.211]  Specifically, here is a quote from one of the lead professors.
[01:49:10.376 --> 01:49:12.359]  Mercury is toxic in all its forms.
[01:49:12.459 --> 01:49:19.568]  Given how much high fructose corn syrup is consumed by children, it could be a significant additional source of mercury never before considered.
[01:49:20.048 --> 01:49:26.156]  We are calling for immediate changes by industry and the FDA to help stop this avoidable mercury contamination of the food supply.
[01:49:26.937 --> 01:49:34.664]  So, specifically now, children are munching down on this garbage, which is bad for them anyway and contains high fructose corn syrup, which is shortening their lives.
[01:49:35.065 --> 01:49:37.687]  But they're also getting a major intake of mercury.
[01:49:38.108 --> 01:49:39.829]  And they've never factored this in before.
[01:49:39.989 --> 01:49:42.312]  And then they're saying, well, gee, what's going on?
[01:49:42.392 --> 01:49:44.133]  Why are all these kids getting cancer?
[01:49:44.173 --> 01:49:48.778]  Why are all these kids having signs of, you know, heavy metal overload and mercury overload?
[01:49:49.278 --> 01:49:59.130]  Why are all these kids getting other sources that we are intaking and not counting all of the high fructose corn syrup and watching them have, you know, childhood diseases that we've never had in the past 50 years?
[01:49:59.531 --> 01:50:06.399]  Well, it's pretty simple and a new study just came out, actually, while I was looking into all this, I found from the University of Utah.
[01:50:06.459 --> 01:50:11.280]  And this is a major, groundbreaking study, has been on the front page of many news outlets.
[01:50:11.320 --> 01:50:24.464]  However, it's interesting to see when the mainstream media won't actually talk about it because they're of course sponsored in many cases by the food manufacturers who have an ad right next to the article proclaiming how safe high fructose corn syrup is and how great their sugary sodas are.
[01:50:24.924 --> 01:50:27.085]  So let's look at this article specifically.
[01:50:27.938 --> 01:50:30.679]  Fructose more toxic than table sugar in mice.
[01:50:30.719 --> 01:50:34.640]  There it is, plainly stated from the University out of Utah.
[01:50:35.220 --> 01:50:51.726]  When University of Utah biologists fed mice sugar in doses proportional to what many people eat, the fructose-glucose mixture found in high fructose corn syrup was more toxic than sucrose or table sugar, reducing both the reproduction and lifespan of female rodents.
[01:50:52.813 --> 01:50:53.273]  There it is.
[01:50:53.713 --> 01:50:56.014]  And they don't even mention that it contains mercury.
[01:50:56.435 --> 01:50:57.615]  Is it the mercury doing this?
[01:50:57.795 --> 01:50:59.076]  Is it the other contamination?
[01:50:59.556 --> 01:51:04.178]  Is it the genetically modified ingredients that go into the corn that makes high fructose corn syrup?
[01:51:04.498 --> 01:51:10.621]  Because remember, a large portion of the corn supply, in addition to soy and other crops, are genetically modified.
[01:51:10.681 --> 01:51:17.123]  So, are we being hit by the mercury, the GMOs, or the very constituents that make up high fructose corn syrup?
[01:51:17.163 --> 01:51:18.064]  Let's continue reading.
[01:51:18.704 --> 01:51:26.416]  This is the most robust study showing there is a difference between high fructose corn syrup and table sugar at human relevant doses.
[01:51:26.636 --> 01:51:31.043]  Coming from a biology professor, Wayne Potts, who is the senior author of the study.
[01:51:32.045 --> 01:51:53.622]  Now, we've known this for quite some time, and Princeton also said this back, I believe, in 2010, and they were ostracized from the medical community, saying, high fructose corn syrup is perfectly safe, and that's where those campaigns came from, because everyone hates high fructose corn syrup, and you talk to anyone that cuts that out of their diet, they're instantly losing weight, feeling better, overall getting up in the morning and actually thinking, what's happening?
[01:51:53.702 --> 01:51:58.866]  Oh wait, I'm not dosing myself with GMOs, mercury, and other constituents that make up high fructose corn syrup.
[01:51:59.306 --> 01:52:01.949]  The bottom line, however, is that we are achieving victory.
[01:52:02.289 --> 01:52:06.754]  Because in reality, these corporations are being forced to run away from the truth.
[01:52:07.054 --> 01:52:11.758]  They're being forced to run away from the reality that they're pumping garbage into their products.
[01:52:12.079 --> 01:52:14.982]  They know that you know and you're not going to buy it anymore.
[01:52:15.342 --> 01:52:16.583]  That's why they're rebranding it.
[01:52:16.743 --> 01:52:18.745]  It actually should be hailed as a victory.
[01:52:19.045 --> 01:52:22.388]  These studies coming out is public information and public knowledge growing.
[01:52:22.728 --> 01:52:30.474]  And the corporations, they're running behind their darkness, their shield and their cape of darkness, running away from you because you're actually making a difference.
[01:52:30.554 --> 01:52:32.976]  You are the activist when you don't buy this garbage.
[01:52:33.436 --> 01:52:35.278]  So overall, I would say this is a victory.
[01:52:35.318 --> 01:52:37.620]  I would say spread the word, share the information.
[01:52:37.900 --> 01:52:44.667]  When this is up on InfoWars.com tomorrow in the very early morning and afternoon, share this information.
[01:52:44.967 --> 01:52:51.293]  Because if you are unknowingly eating high fructose corn syrup, or your friends and family, or your kids are eating high fructose corn syrup,
[01:52:51.653 --> 01:53:04.577]  Under this new name, Fructose, and you can share these articles as well to let people know, then they have no idea that they're getting mercury, GMOs, and other garbage in their body on a daily basis that is making them sick, fat, and giving them cancer.
[01:53:05.077 --> 01:53:13.639]  I'm Anthony Giudiciardi, and it's essential to protect your health, and it's great that we're defunding these worthless corporations that are just plugging us full of total garbage.
[01:53:15.541 --> 01:53:30.753]  I'll tell ya, what a team we've got with Darren McBreen and Anthony Gucciardi and Adon Salazar and Nico Acosta and Rob Dew and John Bowne and Jakari Jackson and LeAnn McAdoo and David Knight.
[01:53:30.773 --> 01:53:31.594]  The list just goes on and on.
[01:53:31.614 --> 01:53:32.615]  I know I'm leaving people out of there.
[01:53:32.655 --> 01:53:38.860]  Marcos Morales, Josh Owens, Rob Jacobson, all the support crew, everybody, just everybody.
[01:53:39.400 --> 01:53:51.842]  I need to have like a big group broadcast sometime in the big studio with all the crew that makes the InfoWar possible, but Gucciardi did that teleprompter free and basically no takes.
[01:53:52.322 --> 01:54:00.084]  They stopped and started a few times for him to get his articles in his hand, but he just went off the cuff with the research, with the knowledge.
[01:54:00.124 --> 01:54:04.244]  That's why it came off so much more credible than somebody reading off a teleprompter.
[01:54:04.805 --> 01:54:07.205]  Folks know when they look at the teleprompter and read to them.
[01:54:08.066 --> 01:54:08.727]  That it's canned.
[01:54:09.207 --> 01:54:10.629]  There's no teleprompters around here.
[01:54:11.109 --> 01:54:15.554]  We have computer screens that'll show what's on television so we can watch a clip or see an article.
[01:54:16.515 --> 01:54:27.186]  But we're just telling you the facts and it makes me physically angry that I have to go through hell and high water
[01:54:29.557 --> 01:54:34.719]  And tell my children, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, all the time, and be neurotic at restaurants.
[01:54:35.439 --> 01:54:37.740]  And ask them, what's in this drink?
[01:54:37.840 --> 01:54:40.121]  What's in this dessert, if I'm gonna give them dessert?
[01:54:40.501 --> 01:54:42.142]  And I have to call the chef out.
[01:54:44.263 --> 01:54:46.083]  And they go, oh, there's no additives.
[01:54:46.143 --> 01:54:47.064]  And I go, oh, really?
[01:54:47.604 --> 01:54:48.104]  Let me see.
[01:54:48.124 --> 01:54:52.105]  Oh, we're sorry, so there is high fructose corn syrup in the pumpkin pie.
[01:54:52.125 --> 01:54:55.407]  And I'm just like, can't I just have some pumpkin pie?
[01:54:55.427 --> 01:54:58.568]  I have to spend all this time and energy dodging this stuff.
[01:55:00.495 --> 01:55:01.616]  It's garbage, folks!
[01:55:01.696 --> 01:55:02.516]  It'll kill ya!
[01:55:03.116 --> 01:55:09.639]  They grow it with toxic fertilizers that they have waivers to use in corn production that are full of grignard reagents.
[01:55:09.839 --> 01:55:11.360]  Lead, mercury, arsenic.
[01:55:12.100 --> 01:55:14.021]  In levels way above swordfish.
[01:55:14.461 --> 01:55:15.722]  Way above blue tuna.
[01:55:16.843 --> 01:55:17.563]  Bluefin tuna.
[01:55:19.964 --> 01:55:23.926]  You wonder why the kids are so... You wonder why people are 30 years old getting Alzheimer's now.
[01:55:25.129 --> 01:55:27.830]  Everywhere I go, there's people with neurological disorders.
[01:55:28.590 --> 01:55:29.350]  It's just a wreck!
[01:55:29.370 --> 01:55:30.970]  I look at people's kids.
[01:55:31.010 --> 01:55:32.171]  I can always tell they're vaccinating them.
[01:55:32.191 --> 01:55:33.271]  The kids look like they're brain dead.
[01:55:33.291 --> 01:55:34.391]  They look like little dead zombies.
[01:55:34.951 --> 01:55:35.732]  I want to just warn them.
[01:55:36.132 --> 01:55:36.692]  Sometimes I do it.
[01:55:36.712 --> 01:55:37.852]  I go, Hi, how you doing?
[01:55:38.152 --> 01:55:38.732]  How's your daughter?
[01:55:38.752 --> 01:55:39.092]  How old is she?
[01:55:39.392 --> 01:55:40.273]  They're like, Oh, she's three.
[01:55:40.293 --> 01:55:41.733]  You taking a lot of vaccines?
[01:55:41.753 --> 01:55:45.654]  And they're like, Yeah, she just got one last week.
[01:55:45.694 --> 01:55:46.734]  And I'm like, Well, you better look into those.
[01:55:46.754 --> 01:55:47.694]  She goes, Why are you asking?
[01:55:47.955 --> 01:55:48.815]  It just happened like a week ago.
[01:55:48.835 --> 01:55:49.435]  I was on an elevator.
[01:55:49.515 --> 01:55:52.196]  I said, Sir, they really hurt your children.
[01:55:52.956 --> 01:55:53.796]  How's your daughter doing?
[01:55:55.199 --> 01:55:58.880]  And it freaks them out, because I'm not even saying, hey, you hurt your kid.
[01:55:59.721 --> 01:56:02.322]  I'm walking up to pregnant women at restaurants saying, don't vaccinate.
[01:56:02.622 --> 01:56:03.382]  I'm done!
[01:56:03.702 --> 01:56:04.523]  I'm done!
[01:56:04.803 --> 01:56:05.383]  I'm done!
[01:56:05.423 --> 01:56:06.203]  You understand it?
[01:56:06.403 --> 01:56:07.584]  I've broken your conditioning!
[01:56:07.804 --> 01:56:09.164]  I know you're murdering people!
[01:56:09.325 --> 01:56:10.045]  You scum!
[01:56:10.205 --> 01:56:10.785]  You filth!
[01:56:10.985 --> 01:56:11.565]  You trash!
[01:56:11.725 --> 01:56:15.207]  Do you know how much mercury is in anything with high fructose corn syrup?
[01:56:15.787 --> 01:56:17.868]  Everything the Washington Post tested.
[01:56:19.343 --> 01:56:21.905]  And there's just frickin' hundreds of these studies, hundreds of them!
[01:56:22.465 --> 01:56:25.847]  Everything had mercury and lead in high levels.
[01:56:26.147 --> 01:56:29.169]  You might as well just put mercury drops in your kid's food.
[01:56:29.209 --> 01:56:30.450]  You get my fructose corn syrup.
[01:56:31.070 --> 01:56:35.693]  And I have to go... I mean, I can't tell you how many birthday parties I try to take my kids to and they got Blue Bell ice cream.
[01:56:36.462 --> 01:56:37.222]  That I grew up eating.
[01:56:37.783 --> 01:56:39.183]  And it's got high fructose corn syrup.
[01:56:39.203 --> 01:56:40.884]  They go, Dad, can I have some vanilla?
[01:56:41.384 --> 01:56:43.125]  I'm like, sorry, you just, you can't.
[01:56:43.205 --> 01:56:44.465]  You wanted to go to the birthday party.
[01:56:44.845 --> 01:56:47.546]  I told you, we ain't eating lead, okay?
[01:56:47.766 --> 01:56:49.367]  And it's not that I'm some health nut!
[01:56:50.575 --> 01:56:56.818]  I don't want my kids having a neurological disorder when they're 25 and then burying them when they're 40!
[01:56:57.779 --> 01:56:58.619]  I'm pissed!
[01:56:58.899 --> 01:56:59.460]  Excuse me.
[01:56:59.980 --> 01:57:04.522]  I'm not usually talking like this, but the reason I have trouble even coming on air these days is I'm done.
[01:57:04.782 --> 01:57:05.042]  Okay?
[01:57:05.303 --> 01:57:06.403]  I'm right about all this.
[01:57:06.623 --> 01:57:07.464]  We're right about it.
[01:57:07.684 --> 01:57:08.444]  We're warning you.
[01:57:08.544 --> 01:57:09.465]  We're not heroes.
[01:57:12.586 --> 01:57:19.350]  It's common sense to warn everybody and to be upset about this, and now, fructose
[01:57:20.874 --> 01:57:22.355]  I guess it just means plant sugar.
[01:57:22.695 --> 01:57:25.116]  So now they're going to call it fructose when it's high fructose.
[01:57:25.877 --> 01:57:28.578]  What you don't want is high fructose corn sugar.
[01:57:29.699 --> 01:57:30.900]  It's best I've researched.
[01:57:30.940 --> 01:57:32.280]  I've talked to medical doctors, you name it.
[01:57:34.182 --> 01:57:35.042]  I got a guest coming up.
[01:57:35.082 --> 01:57:36.283]  I'm going to go to break and go to Phyllis.
[01:57:36.563 --> 01:57:45.068]  Actually, Joan's been holding the longest, and then Jeff, and then Phyllis, and then Giovanni, and everybody else.
[01:57:45.128 --> 01:57:45.648]  I'll get to you.
[01:57:45.668 --> 01:57:46.489]  I meant to go to your calls.
[01:57:46.529 --> 01:57:47.209]  I went to some of them.
[01:57:47.249 --> 01:57:48.510]  I just kind of go off on a jag.
[01:57:49.534 --> 01:57:51.076]  Because this isn't a radio broadcast.
[01:57:51.116 --> 01:57:51.616]  It's not me.
[01:57:52.137 --> 01:57:56.741]  It's really upsetting that they're doing this and they've got us used to it.
[01:57:56.781 --> 01:57:58.142]  We're supposed to be calm about it.
[01:57:58.283 --> 01:57:58.683]  Well, you know what?
[01:57:58.703 --> 01:57:59.904]  I'm not calm about it.
[01:58:00.865 --> 01:58:01.886]  I'm not calm about it.
[01:58:02.086 --> 01:58:06.691]  I'm not calm about the government trying to cause a civil war or funding racist groups on both sides.
[01:58:06.751 --> 01:58:07.572]  I'm sick of it.
[01:58:07.812 --> 01:58:09.974]  I'm sick of crooks ruling over us.
[01:58:10.054 --> 01:58:10.895]  None of us are safe.

[01:58:45.551 --> 01:58:47.312]  It's all at Infowarslife.com.
[01:58:47.832 --> 01:58:49.273]  And you're finding the very tip of the spear.
[01:58:49.313 --> 01:58:49.753]  Stay with us.
[01:58:49.773 --> 01:58:51.633]  Third hour coming up with a big whistleblower.
[01:58:51.733 --> 01:58:52.954]  And a lot more.
[01:58:52.974 --> 01:58:54.034]  I've got to get settled down now.
[01:58:54.054 --> 01:58:56.155]  This is a very serious interview coming up.
[01:59:00.529 --> 01:59:07.597]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[01:59:07.697 --> 01:59:09.859]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[01:59:10.059 --> 01:59:15.165]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[01:59:15.345 --> 01:59:20.290]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[01:59:20.490 --> 01:59:23.553]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[01:59:23.813 --> 01:59:27.677]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[01:59:27.897 --> 01:59:32.141]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[01:59:32.222 --> 01:59:42.251]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[01:59:42.451 --> 01:59:44.974]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs,
[01:59:45.154 --> 01:59:47.055]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:00:16.618 --> 02:00:20.800]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:21.461 --> 02:00:22.261]  You want answers?
[02:00:23.041 --> 02:00:23.942]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:24.582 --> 02:00:28.184]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:28.785 --> 02:00:32.847]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:44.480 --> 02:00:48.606]  Alright, Phyllis is up next, then we'll go to, uh, Joan and others.
[02:00:49.247 --> 02:00:51.591]  I got really upset earlier, and I'm not trying to do that on purpose.
[02:00:51.671 --> 02:00:53.834]  I need to control myself, because then I'm exhausted later.
[02:00:54.215 --> 02:00:55.216]  Can't finish all my work.
[02:00:56.639 --> 02:00:58.521]  But, I mean, you're supposed to get mad at this stuff.
[02:01:00.355 --> 02:01:01.416]  Makes me so angry.
[02:01:01.896 --> 02:01:06.137]  Consumer Alert High Fructose Corn Syrup Simply Renamed for Public Backlash.
[02:01:06.657 --> 02:01:08.918]  Read the article, see the video, make it go viral.
[02:01:09.338 --> 02:01:11.339]  Top of Infowars.com right now.
[02:01:11.679 --> 02:01:12.959]  Warn some people, folks!
[02:01:13.439 --> 02:01:14.480]  Fellas, thanks for holding.
[02:01:14.500 --> 02:01:16.020]  You're on the air.
[02:01:18.201 --> 02:01:18.761]  Hi, Alex.
[02:01:19.101 --> 02:01:19.301]  Hi.
[02:01:20.382 --> 02:01:25.463]  I have been listening to you for about three years, and this is the first time I've called.
[02:01:25.583 --> 02:01:27.484]  Well, welcome, sweetheart, and thanks for holding.
[02:01:29.375 --> 02:01:38.879]  Okay, I know you've got a guest coming up that was an FBI informant or, you know, asset something.
[02:01:39.860 --> 02:01:50.164]  And I was wondering, you know, I know we're talking a lot about the, you know, Europe and the Middle East and all the training that's going on there.
[02:01:51.267 --> 02:02:00.150]  Uh, that we're helping fund and our, um, and our allies are helping fund the ISIS and... Who now they link directly to the shooters.
[02:02:00.970 --> 02:02:03.871]  But then none of the media will say, oh, we shouldn't have funded ISIS.
[02:02:04.812 --> 02:02:09.613]  I mean, again, that's like putting mercury in the high fructose corn syrup at high levels and it's not even an issue.
[02:02:09.653 --> 02:02:10.934]  It's just all over the top.
[02:02:12.193 --> 02:02:12.613]  It is.
[02:02:12.633 --> 02:02:13.614]  It is.
[02:02:14.114 --> 02:02:26.903]  But my concern today, and I've looked at these articles, you know, several times over the years, is the terrorist trading cells that are here in the United States.
[02:02:27.024 --> 02:02:27.564]  Oh, they're here!
[02:02:28.985 --> 02:02:29.685]  Yeah, they are.
[02:02:29.846 --> 02:02:34.709]  And I was wondering if your guest that's coming up could, you know, give us some insight into this.
[02:02:34.829 --> 02:02:35.730]  I'm from Georgia.
[02:02:35.950 --> 02:02:41.194]  And matter of fact, I mean, I listen to you talk about your family from, you know, the
[02:02:42.279 --> 02:02:46.142]  Alabama and your Texas roots.
[02:02:46.922 --> 02:02:55.749]  My Georgia roots, I have a uncle, well not an uncle, but he's an ancestor that fought in the War of 1812.
[02:02:56.469 --> 02:03:00.032]  Oh yeah, against the British.
[02:03:00.192 --> 02:03:05.756]  And there's a county in Georgia that's named after him and his sword
[02:03:08.416 --> 02:03:08.657]  Yes.
[02:03:19.597 --> 02:03:26.342]  Yeah, the training camps, you know, there's like three, well actually four according to this website that I found.
[02:03:26.462 --> 02:03:34.908]  Oh, listen, listen, I've got New York Times articles about terror training camps all over the country where they quote, are training jihadis to fight other jihadis.
[02:03:35.168 --> 02:03:36.549]  These are government run.
[02:03:36.829 --> 02:03:38.550]  They don't need to have secret training camps.
[02:03:38.971 --> 02:03:41.532]  They've got these jihad training camps all over the US.
[02:03:41.592 --> 02:03:43.534]  It's totally disgusting.
[02:03:44.758 --> 02:04:12.023]  Well, you know, the cities that they lift, you know, for Georgia is Augusta, Commerce, Macon, and Jessup, but the Commerce, you know, city is in Franklin County, but the Jihadi training camp is actually in Habersham County, and that is the same county that the little boy was maimed with a flash grenade by the
[02:04:13.220 --> 02:04:14.402]  By the police.
[02:04:14.703 --> 02:04:21.615]  The local police there went in and, you know, maimed a little boy in a no-knock raid.
[02:04:22.276 --> 02:04:23.217]  Oh yeah, with the flashbang?
[02:04:24.099 --> 02:04:31.625]  But there is a jihadi training camp in Habersham County, which is a sister county of the county where my mother lives.
[02:04:31.985 --> 02:04:33.847]  Well, we need folks to get in there and get some footage.
[02:04:33.887 --> 02:04:42.154]  In fact, we can dig up from old mainstream articles where some of those government training camps are, where they have the blacked-out buses going in, and that's the kind of thing we need to cover.
[02:04:42.214 --> 02:04:43.895]  By the way, that's dangerous, covering that.
[02:04:44.375 --> 02:04:48.819]  I tried to cover that once, and I didn't get anything, and all hell broke loose.
[02:04:49.199 --> 02:04:52.282]  They were breaking into my hotel room, sabotaging our car,
[02:04:55.311 --> 02:04:58.535]  Needless to say, I don't do that stuff anymore, just because I got too much to handle here.
[02:04:59.276 --> 02:05:02.339]  Used to be a funner job, though, when I was the guy always out in the field.
[02:05:02.980 --> 02:05:05.543]  I still go out in the field occasionally, like Fat Albert.
[02:05:06.084 --> 02:05:07.425]  All right, we'll be back with our guest.
[02:05:07.445 --> 02:05:07.846]  Stay with us.
[02:05:11.397 --> 02:05:14.898]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[02:05:15.038 --> 02:05:19.019]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[02:05:19.319 --> 02:05:20.779]  Can you put two and two together?
[02:05:21.099 --> 02:05:28.681]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[02:05:28.961 --> 02:05:29.801]  But for how long?
[02:05:30.101 --> 02:05:36.362]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com, spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[02:05:36.742 --> 02:05:39.543]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[02:05:41.041 --> 02:05:44.243]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[02:05:44.544 --> 02:05:52.549]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[02:05:52.790 --> 02:05:57.813]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[02:05:58.214 --> 02:06:00.495]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?

[02:06:23.440 --> 02:06:30.483]  We have rejected literally hundreds of products from the Infowarslife line because they are not of the very highest
[02:06:30.503 --> 02:06:31.224]  We're good to go.
[02:06:48.079 --> 02:06:48.900]  We're good to go.
[02:07:11.121 --> 02:07:13.704]  Every year we make resolutions to lose weight and get in shape.
[02:07:13.804 --> 02:07:14.965]  And the truth is, it's hard.
[02:07:15.225 --> 02:07:16.686]  Even with diet and exercise.
[02:07:16.907 --> 02:07:21.951]  Because of toxic food in our environment that is stressing our bodies more than ever before.
[02:07:22.091 --> 02:07:28.918]  Working with experts in nutrition and biochemistry, I found that super high quality nutraceuticals, in addition to my diet and exercise,
[02:07:29.218 --> 02:07:31.219]  Worthy answers that synergistically worked.
[02:07:31.459 --> 02:07:38.042]  I can see the drastic changes every day with the amount of weight I've lost, my increased stamina, and more of a twinkle in my eye.
[02:07:38.282 --> 02:07:44.205]  That's why we are now so excited to launch the InfoWars Life Resolution Pack, combining three essential formulations.

[02:08:00.730 --> 02:08:03.851]  2015 is the year to do it and it all starts at Infowarslife.com.
[02:08:15.577 --> 02:08:15.657]  USA!
[02:08:15.678 --> 02:08:15.818]  USA!
[02:08:16.898 --> 02:08:17.038]  USA!
[02:08:18.179 --> 02:08:18.319]  USA!
[02:08:19.460 --> 02:08:19.640]  USA!
[02:08:20.841 --> 02:08:26.285]  If you let one ant stand up to us, then they all might stand up.
[02:08:27.005 --> 02:08:31.489]  Those puny little ants outnumber us a hundred to one.
[02:08:32.009 --> 02:08:36.052]  And if they ever figure that out, there goes our way of life.
[02:08:36.872 --> 02:08:38.153]  It's not about food.
[02:08:38.874 --> 02:08:41.476]  It's about keeping those ants in line.
[02:08:48.109 --> 02:08:49.830]  The Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:50.250 --> 02:08:53.251]  Because there is a war on for your mind.
[02:08:56.793 --> 02:09:15.681]  Back in 1993, right after the first World Trade Center attack, I remember listening to local talk radio, where a talk show host was discussing Imad Salem,
[02:09:17.199 --> 02:09:29.123]  The FBI informant, the former Egyptian military colonel who went undercover for the FBI and infiltrated the first Al-Qaeda cell on American soil in New York City during the 93 World Trade Center bombing.
[02:09:29.784 --> 02:09:45.970]  He also penetrated the headquarters of Al-Qaeda in America under the leadership of the blind sheik Omar Abdel Rahman and the underground terrorist cell who was planning to blow up the landmarks in New York City and became a government star witness in the day of the terror trial.
[02:09:46.750 --> 02:09:53.439]  He is the author of Undercover, the Untold Story of Al Qaeda, the FBI and the CIA in America.
[02:09:55.201 --> 02:09:57.364]  ImadSalem.org.
[02:09:57.824 --> 02:09:58.485]  I've read the book.
[02:09:58.565 --> 02:09:59.667]  It came in a few weeks ago.
[02:09:59.747 --> 02:10:01.850]  Extremely powerful information.
[02:10:02.967 --> 02:10:08.148]  Now, folks, we're going to recap today in the next 50-something minutes what happened in 93.
[02:10:08.669 --> 02:10:11.549]  He sent a lot of photos and clips for TV viewers.
[02:10:12.349 --> 02:10:18.831]  For radio listeners, you can go to Infowars.com forward slash show and find the free video feed.
[02:10:19.371 --> 02:10:25.593]  Or by tomorrow, we'll have an archive of this on the front page of PrisonPlanet.com and Infowars.com.
[02:10:26.233 --> 02:10:29.174]  But this guy is a patriot for freedom.
[02:10:31.343 --> 02:10:41.014]  He worked in intelligence operations, fought extremists in the Middle East, Egypt, one of our biggest allies, as you know, betrayed, set up, turned over to radicals, and the military came in and ousted him.
[02:10:41.494 --> 02:10:43.777]  It's a destabilization program that's going on.
[02:10:44.077 --> 02:10:50.124]  Well, he came over here, when Egypt was one of our staunchest allies, and helped infiltrate these groups.
[02:10:51.784 --> 02:10:53.966]  And it even came out in the New York Times.
[02:10:53.986 --> 02:10:55.287]  I'm going to show TV viewers this.
[02:10:55.367 --> 02:10:56.568]  Radio listeners can look it up.
[02:10:57.628 --> 02:10:58.949]  This is from October 28th, 1993.
[02:10:59.830 --> 02:11:04.414]  Tapes depict proposal to thwart bomb used in trade center blast.
[02:11:05.174 --> 02:11:18.064]  And Mr. Salem, he, just to give you a boil down, and he'll say it in his own words and correct areas that I don't get exactly right,
[02:11:19.577 --> 02:11:20.558]  I made a film about this.
[02:11:20.598 --> 02:11:22.679]  I've been covering this since right after it happened.
[02:11:22.699 --> 02:11:25.620]  This is one of the reasons I heard a local talk show that was talking about it.
[02:11:25.700 --> 02:11:27.101]  Went and bought the New York Times.
[02:11:27.901 --> 02:11:29.923]  Back then you had to go to a newspaper shop to find them.
[02:11:30.383 --> 02:11:30.703]  Read it.
[02:11:30.763 --> 02:11:40.188]  Couldn't believe the FBI would basically tell him to build a bomb, give him real detonators, and then tell him, let it go forward.
[02:11:40.608 --> 02:11:41.689]  And then he tried to stop it.
[02:11:41.969 --> 02:11:43.510]  That was a game changer for me.
[02:11:44.537 --> 02:11:49.100]  Then we saw Waco and that cover up, and Oklahoma City, which was clearly another false flag.
[02:11:50.581 --> 02:11:51.761]  That's why I got on air.
[02:11:51.781 --> 02:11:54.323]  It took me two years to get on air, I got on air in 95.
[02:11:54.703 --> 02:12:05.230]  So, Mr. Salem's story, to show how a rock leaves big ripples in a pond, is one of the things that triggered, his courage, is one of the things that triggered
[02:12:06.303 --> 02:12:16.802]  This broadcast being on air today and being the number one place in the world, hands down, exposing the fact of Operation Gladio, other operations of provocateur terror.
[02:12:17.685 --> 02:12:24.252]  And an attempt to radicalize liberal groups, conservative groups, Islamic groups, you name it, to discredit them.
[02:12:24.633 --> 02:12:26.034]  Now, that's my take on it.
[02:12:26.895 --> 02:12:31.320]  Ahmad Salem can give it to you in his take, but Colonel, we appreciate you coming on.
[02:12:31.340 --> 02:12:33.803]  This is an amazing chance to talk to you.
[02:12:34.083 --> 02:12:35.745]  Your book is just amazing.
[02:12:35.765 --> 02:12:37.687]  I got so much, even more insight.
[02:12:38.268 --> 02:12:39.789]  Of course, you tried to stop them.
[02:12:39.809 --> 02:12:41.030]  They tried to then set you up.
[02:12:41.110 --> 02:12:44.793]  I know you then recorded them, and so were able to get a settlement.
[02:12:45.114 --> 02:12:52.099]  Thank God you did that, because you're one of the only people on the inside to ever get out alive who exposes a false flag.
[02:12:52.400 --> 02:12:54.361]  So you've got the floor, sir, to recap 1993.
[02:12:54.461 --> 02:13:01.507]  And then I know you want to move forward and talk about ISIS, about Obama, about Al Qaeda in America.
[02:13:01.827 --> 02:13:04.109]  You've got some incredible intel for us today.
[02:13:04.189 --> 02:13:05.030]  So God bless you.
[02:13:05.290 --> 02:13:05.991]  Thank you for coming on.
[02:13:07.028 --> 02:13:08.590]  Thank you, Alex, for having me.
[02:13:08.650 --> 02:13:27.291]  I really appreciate the opportunity to give me the platform to talk about the experience I have been through since 1990 with the FBI when I started to do covert operation against the Russian with the New York office for the Russian squad.
[02:13:28.393 --> 02:13:44.754]  Um, at that time I was employed in Manhattan in a hotel and I was a chief engineer slash head of security and I was approached by one of the FBI agents in the counterterrorism
[02:13:46.515 --> 02:14:07.025]  In the Russian squad and she requested my cooperation and it was a blessing and a great deal of ownership for me to assist the FBI to infiltrate this group of Russians and this operation lasted I would say six to eight months.
[02:14:07.865 --> 02:14:17.751]  And after that, Nancy Floyd, the FBI agent who did recruit me to do that operation, moved me to the INS.
[02:14:17.931 --> 02:14:21.674]  I did another operation covertly with the INS.
[02:14:21.754 --> 02:14:23.895]  It resulted into 72 arrests.
[02:14:25.336 --> 02:14:27.558]  And then I moved into the terrorist squad.
[02:14:27.699 --> 02:14:36.287]  And that's at the beginning of my involvement with the JTTF, which is the Joint Terrorist Task Force, the New York office.
[02:14:37.168 --> 02:14:41.233]  And there is few things I would like to correct it that
[02:14:42.734 --> 02:14:48.776]  So many news outlets reported that I went to the FBI and knocked the door.
[02:14:48.796 --> 02:14:49.916]  I said I had information.
[02:14:50.216 --> 02:14:51.457]  That's false information.
[02:14:51.477 --> 02:15:00.920]  Actually, the FBI came to my office in the hotel at that time and requested my cooperation, and I was completely honored to do it.
[02:15:01.520 --> 02:15:08.423]  With no return or no payment or no nothing because I did my job as a U.S.
[02:15:08.483 --> 02:15:09.003]  citizen.
[02:15:09.023 --> 02:15:11.404]  So you did it for honor and justice?
[02:15:11.965 --> 02:15:12.725]  Absolutely.
[02:15:13.285 --> 02:15:18.408]  Not a penny for the first six months and then another three months for the I.N.S.
[02:15:19.568 --> 02:15:21.629]  And then I started with the terrorist squad.
[02:15:21.669 --> 02:15:31.193]  At that time, it was assassination in Manhattan for a Jewish rabbi, his name is Meir Kahane, by an Arab person.
[02:15:32.133 --> 02:15:37.435]  And the FBI didn't have enough information about what's going on inside this group.
[02:15:38.016 --> 02:15:40.817]  They asked me to go inside and I did.
[02:15:42.122 --> 02:15:57.188]  And I became a member of El Sayyid Nusayr, which is the assassin of Meir Kahane, his group of fundraising and collecting money to support his defense.
[02:15:57.408 --> 02:16:01.530]  And he was being defended by a Jewish lawyer.
[02:16:01.550 --> 02:16:02.911]  His name is William Kanzler.
[02:16:03.111 --> 02:16:04.671]  He is no longer with us now.
[02:16:04.711 --> 02:16:05.472]  He passed away.
[02:16:06.332 --> 02:16:15.956]  However, Sayyid Nusayr was acquitted in the first part, but because of the information I provided, I went to Sayyid Nusayr in prison in Attica.
[02:16:18.613 --> 02:16:40.883]  And in Rikers Island, and he told me that he did do the assassination and he described it to me in details how he did it because I was one of the insiders at that time and he thought that I am a fanatic as well and I am going for the assassination of human beings, which I don't.
[02:16:42.337 --> 02:16:49.862]  No matter what the agreement or disagreement with somebody else, he's a human being, I have no rights to take his life.
[02:16:50.482 --> 02:16:55.445]  But that was a fatwa from the blind Sheikh, Sheikh Omar Abdel Rahman.
[02:16:57.562 --> 02:17:13.030]  It came a day during my infiltration to Sayyid Nusayr's group, I was approached by one of the Joint Terrorist Task Force Special Agent, John Anticev, and he showed me a newspaper picture for the Blind Sheikh.
[02:17:13.090 --> 02:17:14.490]  He said, do you know this person?
[02:17:14.530 --> 02:17:19.153]  I said, yes, this is Sheikh Omar Abdul Rahman, who assassinated my President.
[02:17:20.362 --> 02:17:21.144]  Anwar Sadat.
[02:17:21.825 --> 02:17:31.362]  At that time, I was still in the service in the Egyptian military and I was present during the parade President Sadat was assassinated in.
[02:17:32.501 --> 02:17:38.726]  And I said, Agent John told me that this man is in New Jersey.
[02:17:38.746 --> 02:17:42.229]  I said, my God, how did he came to New Jersey?
[02:17:42.249 --> 02:17:44.730]  He said, well, that's unknown at this time.
[02:17:44.750 --> 02:17:47.312]  But what do you think?
[02:17:47.412 --> 02:17:50.215]  I said, I think he is a pretty dangerous man.
[02:17:50.235 --> 02:17:54.538]  This man, wherever he go, people drop dead.
[02:17:55.018 --> 02:17:57.320]  And he is on the terrorist list.
[02:17:57.400 --> 02:17:59.742]  How did this man came into America?
[02:18:00.788 --> 02:18:03.211]  Lo and behold, he said, can you approach him?
[02:18:03.451 --> 02:18:05.634]  I did approach the blind Sheikh.
[02:18:06.755 --> 02:18:08.657]  And I get very close to him.
[02:18:11.200 --> 02:18:12.441]  Covidly, of course.
[02:18:13.182 --> 02:18:17.948]  And then he asked me to go on a trip with him for fundraising into Detroit.
[02:18:19.505 --> 02:18:22.468]  At that time, the FBI provided me with a van.
[02:18:23.769 --> 02:18:29.375]  That van was electronically bugged through a certain chopper.
[02:18:30.076 --> 02:18:33.519]  They have their way of recording the information.
[02:18:34.180 --> 02:18:38.344]  But during our trip from New York to Detroit,
[02:18:39.005 --> 02:18:44.247]  The Blind Sheikh asked me, I heard that you are retired from special ops in Egypt.
[02:18:44.347 --> 02:18:45.267]  I said, yes sir.
[02:18:45.968 --> 02:18:48.829]  OK, do you know how to shoot?
[02:18:49.189 --> 02:18:50.109]  Yes sir, of course.
[02:18:50.369 --> 02:18:51.430]  Are you a sharpshooter?
[02:18:51.530 --> 02:18:52.070]  I said, yes.
[02:18:52.470 --> 02:19:02.194]  He said, OK, if you wanted to repent from serving an infidel government, then you need to assassinate President Hosni Mubarak.
[02:19:02.654 --> 02:19:06.356]  At that time, Mubarak was coming the next Wednesday.
[02:19:07.236 --> 02:19:24.903]  It was shocking for me to have a straight order from the Blind Sheikh, because he got the word first from his followers that I'm collecting money for Sayyid Nusayr, I'm one of the close people to the Nusayr group, and that's why he attempted to give me that order.
[02:19:25.584 --> 02:19:28.625]  And of course, all of that's being recorded on tapes.
[02:19:30.279 --> 02:19:33.121]  I said, OK, I think that's a good idea.
[02:19:33.141 --> 02:19:34.562]  I did not decline.
[02:19:35.202 --> 02:19:49.912]  And I made a point to bring that to the attention of my handlers at that time, which is Special Agent John Anticip and Detective Louis Napoli from the terrorist squad in the New York office.
[02:19:50.553 --> 02:19:53.695]  We came back from Detroit and
[02:19:54.950 --> 02:19:58.675]  Uh, the blind sheikh requested me to visit Sayyid Nusayr in Attica.
[02:19:59.576 --> 02:20:01.218]  I went to visit him in Attica.
[02:20:01.459 --> 02:20:04.342]  He gives me the order to build a bomb.
[02:20:04.823 --> 02:20:06.044]  Do you know how to build a bomb?
[02:20:06.104 --> 02:20:09.048]  I said, of course, um, it's special ops.
[02:20:09.629 --> 02:20:12.393]  He said, okay, I would like you to build a bomb and, uh,
[02:20:13.444 --> 02:20:21.648]  Kidnap Henry Kissinger and Judge Duffy, who ruled against him in this case.
[02:20:22.488 --> 02:20:27.991]  And if you can kidnap an FBI agent, that would be great, so you can bargain to release me.
[02:20:28.985 --> 02:20:31.606]  I said, OK, Sheikh, that's a good idea.
[02:20:31.766 --> 02:20:34.647]  And I went back, I reported that to my handlers.
[02:20:35.427 --> 02:20:43.030]  From this point on, I start to ask Saddam Hussein in the next visit, how am I going to build the bombs?
[02:20:43.110 --> 02:20:44.250]  I don't have materials.
[02:20:44.310 --> 02:20:45.211]  I don't know what to do.
[02:20:46.212 --> 02:20:48.534]  And that's as per the instructions.
[02:20:49.315 --> 02:21:04.950]  I was instructed by my handlers in the JTTF not to dictate or not to suggest targets or not to suggest bombings, but I always ask open-end questions.
[02:21:06.031 --> 02:21:09.014]  And my open-end questions, how am I going to build the bomb?
[02:21:09.154 --> 02:21:10.235]  I don't have material.
[02:21:11.266 --> 02:21:17.272]  Sayyid Nasir described to me where to go in Canal Street, what street, what is the name of the store.
[02:21:18.118 --> 02:21:19.699]  Where to buy the fuse?
[02:21:19.739 --> 02:21:21.620]  Where to buy the explosives?
[02:21:22.340 --> 02:21:23.160]  I said, great.
[02:21:23.781 --> 02:21:25.241]  I came back from Attica.
[02:21:25.382 --> 02:21:26.602]  I went to Canal Street.
[02:21:26.942 --> 02:21:28.243]  I bought the fuse.
[02:21:28.943 --> 02:21:31.324]  And I went to my handlers in the bureau.
[02:21:31.665 --> 02:21:35.286]  At that time, they said, it is getting very serious.
[02:21:35.326 --> 02:21:38.448]  We have to bring you up to the ASAC.
[02:21:39.048 --> 02:21:44.451]  The ASAC in the FBI means Assistant Special Agent in Charge.
[02:21:45.211 --> 02:21:51.578]  His name is Carson Danbach, and he is in charge of the counter-terrorism in the New York office at the time.
[02:21:53.040 --> 02:22:03.551]  I said, Sayyid Nasser requested from me to build a bomb, told me where to get the materials, here is the fuse, I got it, and now I need to know what to do.
[02:22:04.488 --> 02:22:06.289]  He said, I gotta put you on the box.
[02:22:06.869 --> 02:22:08.110]  I said, what do you mean, box?
[02:22:08.450 --> 02:22:09.770]  Gotta put you on a polygraph.
[02:22:10.371 --> 02:22:23.236]  Well, I have been working with you guys almost for a year now, with the Russian squad, with the INS, with the Nusir assassination, and now you're coming to tell me you wanna polygraph me?
[02:22:23.276 --> 02:22:24.097]  You have no trust?
[02:22:24.177 --> 02:22:24.877]  He said, no.
[02:22:25.217 --> 02:22:28.419]  Put me on the polygraph is not gonna get a result, Mr. Carson.
[02:22:29.159 --> 02:22:30.439]  He said, why, Salem?
[02:22:30.539 --> 02:22:33.881]  I said, because I know how to fool the machine.
[02:22:35.515 --> 02:22:37.958]  He said, I don't care, put him on the box.
[02:22:38.919 --> 02:22:45.967]  They got an examiner, put me on the box, and the conclusion came that unconclusive result.
[02:22:46.668 --> 02:22:49.651]  So I went to Mr. Danbar, I said, I told you so.
[02:22:49.711 --> 02:22:54.197]  He said, I don't care, put him on another examiner for another polygraph.
[02:22:55.413 --> 02:22:58.534]  I went for the second polygraph, came unconclusive.
[02:22:59.094 --> 02:23:13.756]  He called Washington headquarter for the FBI, brought the head of the examiners from Washington to conduct the test by himself, so it will not be unconclusive as usual.
[02:23:15.376 --> 02:23:23.478]  The gentleman who came from the headquarter rubbed me wrong and he conducted a test and I proved him that I can fool his machine.
[02:23:24.673 --> 02:23:27.475]  And I'm being frank about it because I have nothing to hide.
[02:23:28.555 --> 02:23:36.220]  Yet he came that it is unconclusive, but his feeling is that I am deceptive.
[02:23:37.261 --> 02:23:38.642]  And that became a personal
[02:23:40.974 --> 02:23:43.416]  Disagreement between me and the examiner.
[02:23:43.436 --> 02:23:51.502]  The third exam in one week, and it came unconclusive, but once he go to Washington, I became deceptive.
[02:23:51.602 --> 02:24:01.549]  I said, I really... Sure, and just to be clear, polygraphs are now basically not admissible because all you've got to do is stay upset the entire time at every question, and then it's just all over the map.
[02:24:01.569 --> 02:24:02.630]  There's other ways to beat them.
[02:24:03.231 --> 02:24:07.254]  They're only there to fool people into thinking that they know you're lying.
[02:24:07.694 --> 02:24:12.296]  They do have some brain scans now that are more accurate, but even those are fraudulent.
[02:24:12.436 --> 02:24:17.198]  It's a quack machine so that they can basically demonize whoever they want.
[02:24:17.239 --> 02:24:20.920]  But regardless, your whole story's come out in the Washington Post, New York Times.
[02:24:21.360 --> 02:24:23.461]  What happened to you was recorded coming up.
[02:24:23.842 --> 02:24:25.662]  You've been proven to be accurate and correct.
[02:24:25.723 --> 02:24:29.604]  I think the polygraph thing is interesting, but not that important in the final equation.
[02:24:30.105 --> 02:24:34.507]  And we have Ahmad Salem, the former Egyptian military colonel.
[02:24:35.407 --> 02:24:36.888]  Worked in intelligence, you name it.
[02:24:37.388 --> 02:24:50.776]  Became a citizen, moved to the U.S., began working with the FBI, infiltrating very dangerous Russian-type assassination groups, then infiltrating radical Islamic groups that were assassinating people, if you just tuned in.
[02:24:51.537 --> 02:24:56.240]  Again, the New York Times, tapes to pick proposal to thwart bomb used in Trade Center blast.
[02:24:56.540 --> 02:24:57.941]  He's building up to win.
[02:24:58.561 --> 02:25:01.243]  Okay, they've built the bomb, they're real terrorists.
[02:25:01.903 --> 02:25:05.685]  Now let's bust them and the FBI basically lets it go forward.
[02:25:06.265 --> 02:25:07.946]  Continue telling the rest of the story.
[02:25:08.286 --> 02:25:11.428]  Then I want to move forward to the intel that's really important.
[02:25:12.188 --> 02:25:12.468]  Okay.
[02:25:12.828 --> 02:25:17.831]  Because, I mean, your take on ISIS, Obama, the radicalization, all the things that are happening.
[02:25:18.211 --> 02:25:19.452]  Please, Mr. Salem.
[02:25:20.322 --> 02:25:20.742]  Yes, sir.
[02:25:21.923 --> 02:25:32.127]  It came to the point that Mr. Carson Dunbar started to dislike me personally, that very three examiners come, unconclusive.
[02:25:32.507 --> 02:25:34.528]  He insists that I wear a wire.
[02:25:35.108 --> 02:25:39.250]  I was working as an intelligence gathering asset.
[02:25:39.930 --> 02:25:40.930]  As they described it.
[02:25:41.411 --> 02:25:47.013]  And I never had intention to testify and become a star witness and all of the above.
[02:25:47.073 --> 02:25:57.957]  But at that moment, if I wear a wire as he requested, I will be obligated, I'll become a character witness and I'll be obligated to testify in an open court.
[02:25:59.161 --> 02:26:02.763]  And at that time, I have a family, I have a wife, I have two children.
[02:26:02.783 --> 02:26:10.428]  I don't want to jeopardize their life by disclosing my covert work.
[02:26:11.389 --> 02:26:24.398]  Mr. Dambar insists, I said, I'm willing to put the, to weave the wire and bring you the information on that tape that Mr. Nusir asked me to build the bomb, if that's what you're concerned about, but I don't testify in court.
[02:26:24.518 --> 02:26:25.959]  He said, no, then go home.
[02:26:25.979 --> 02:26:27.520]  I said, go home?
[02:26:28.629 --> 02:26:32.500]  The people asking me to build a bomb, you're telling me and I'm the only one?
[02:26:34.141 --> 02:26:38.164]  Who is giving you ears and eyes inside the cell, you tell me, go home?
[02:26:38.684 --> 02:26:39.805]  He said, yes, go home.
[02:26:40.466 --> 02:26:41.146]  I said, okay.
[02:26:41.927 --> 02:26:53.195]  And I told the three agents who were standing at the door of Mr. Danbar, Agent John Anisev, Agent Lewy Napoli, Detective Lewy Napoli, and Agent Nancy Floyd.
[02:26:53.295 --> 02:27:02.822]  I said, okay, I'm going home, but if the bomb got built on, get built, and went off, don't come and knock on my door.
[02:27:03.562 --> 02:27:06.443]  That was November 1992.
[02:27:07.764 --> 02:27:21.830]  December came, and I got bombarded by phone calls from the mosque in Queens by Mahmoud Abu Halima and other members of the cell to come to continue building the bombs, and I refused.
[02:27:21.910 --> 02:27:23.751]  I said, I'm scared of the FBI.
[02:27:24.111 --> 02:27:28.993]  They are monitoring me and surveilling me, and I pulled completely out of the cell.
[02:27:29.733 --> 02:27:39.560]  And that's at the time when Sheikh Omar reached out for Afghanistan, and I know how his communication to get around being traced.
[02:27:39.600 --> 02:27:49.766]  He was going to Osama Bin Laden via fax machine in his bedroom in New Jersey, because I saw that myself, and requested another bomb builder.
[02:27:50.027 --> 02:27:53.229]  And that's when Ramzi Ahmed Youssef came to the country.
[02:27:54.212 --> 02:27:54.833]  We're good to go.
[02:28:13.275 --> 02:28:17.076]  Subpoenaed them, they have their fingerprints, they have the whole information.
[02:28:17.496 --> 02:28:20.476]  But unfortunately, they didn't follow up on them.
[02:28:20.997 --> 02:28:25.998]  Ramzi Ahmad Yusuf came, built the bomb, went off in 1993.
[02:28:26.638 --> 02:28:32.959]  I was in my front room watching TV and then I hear that there is a bomb went off in the World Trade Center.
[02:28:33.299 --> 02:28:35.819]  I called my wife and said, honey, they did it.
[02:28:36.260 --> 02:28:36.980]  It's been built.
[02:28:37.260 --> 02:28:37.920]  It's done.
[02:28:38.894 --> 02:28:44.837]  And then, as I expected, they came to knock on my door, come back, because the bomb went off.
[02:28:46.398 --> 02:28:47.919]  This is a crucial point.
[02:28:48.619 --> 02:28:52.001]  It was not a black-flag operation.
[02:28:52.021 --> 02:28:53.742]  It's not a false operation.
[02:28:54.183 --> 02:29:02.847]  It's a real crazy idiots, fanatics, who wanted to commit jihad under the leadership of the White House.
[02:29:02.867 --> 02:29:05.069]  Sir, I want to be clear and not split hairs here, Colonel.
[02:29:05.869 --> 02:29:19.217]  I consider a false flag when you know something's going on, you've got a $50 billion budget, like the FBI and Justice Department have, and then you don't go stop people.
[02:29:19.517 --> 02:29:27.742]  If I know that my neighbor is going to kill his wife tomorrow, he tells me I'm going to kill my wife when she gets home in the garage and says she committed suicide, and then he kills her,
[02:29:28.502 --> 02:29:29.444]  I'm aiding and abetting.
[02:29:29.544 --> 02:29:31.587]  I'm now an accomplice because I didn't do anything.
[02:29:31.927 --> 02:29:32.729]  So that's my point.
[02:29:32.769 --> 02:29:34.491]  Yes, I know they're real crazy jihadis.
[02:29:34.531 --> 02:29:35.152]  I understand that.
[02:29:35.513 --> 02:29:36.534]  I know you tried to stop them.
[02:29:37.536 --> 02:29:40.260]  My point is, that's still a false flag in my view.
[02:29:41.300 --> 02:29:42.681]  Because you let them do it.
[02:29:42.721 --> 02:29:44.462]  But we can come back and argue that point.
[02:29:44.902 --> 02:29:48.905]  I didn't want to move forward to how you recorded them to protect yourself and the rest of it.
[02:29:49.985 --> 02:29:56.309]  And then we're going to come back and get into your view on ISIS, the attacks in Paris, Barack Hussein Obama.
[02:29:56.329 --> 02:29:57.450]  I know you want to talk about him.
[02:29:57.670 --> 02:29:59.131]  This is big what's coming up, folks.
[02:29:59.811 --> 02:30:00.711]  We're on the march.
[02:30:01.212 --> 02:30:02.813]  The empire's on the run.
[02:30:03.733 --> 02:30:06.415]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[02:33:00.286 --> 02:33:03.307]  2015 is the year to do it and it all starts at Infowarslife.com.
[02:33:22.114 --> 02:33:26.039]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[02:33:26.580 --> 02:33:27.982]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:32.913 --> 02:33:39.660]  Last winter, the FBI was praised for its speed in cracking the case of the World Trade Center bombing and bringing four suspects to trial.
[02:33:40.101 --> 02:33:49.590]  Now, there is some evidence that the FBI may have known of the plot in advance, through an informant, and might, might even have stopped the bombing that killed six people.
[02:33:49.991 --> 02:33:51.953]  Correspondent Jacqueline Adams has the story.
[02:33:54.150 --> 02:33:59.992]  FBI agents might have been able to prevent last February's deadly explosion at New York's World Trade Center.
[02:34:00.392 --> 02:34:08.635]  They discussed secretly substituting harmless powder for the explosives, but they didn't, according to the FBI's own informant, Imad Salem.
[02:34:09.275 --> 02:34:14.416]  Unbeknownst to the FBI at the time, Salem recorded many of his conversations with his handlers.
[02:34:14.837 --> 02:34:16.617]  I'm holding 903 pages of draft transcripts.
[02:34:19.378 --> 02:34:29.232]  William Kunstler represents Sheikh Omar Abdel Rahman and several others charged with conspiring to blow up a series of New York City landmarks four months after the World Trade Center bombing.
[02:34:29.733 --> 02:34:31.796]  That case has not yet gone to trial.
[02:34:32.336 --> 02:34:35.901]  Kunstler confirmed newspaper reports of the Salem transcripts.
[02:34:36.582 --> 02:34:41.247]  In one, Salem complains to an FBI agent, since the bomb went off, I feel terrible.
[02:34:41.427 --> 02:34:42.048]  I feel bad.
[02:34:42.448 --> 02:34:44.370]  I feel, here is people who don't listen.
[02:34:44.991 --> 02:34:49.255]  The agent replies, hey, I mean, it wasn't like you didn't try and I didn't try.
[02:34:49.615 --> 02:34:51.577]  You can't force people to do the right thing.
[02:34:51.958 --> 02:34:55.181]  There is material in here to show gross governmental misconduct.
[02:34:55.582 --> 02:34:58.645]  Today, attorneys for the defendants in the... Alright, let's stop right there.
[02:35:00.370 --> 02:35:06.971]  That's from October 28, 1993, CBS News, using that for archival free speech purposes to analyze historical events.
[02:35:07.432 --> 02:35:17.314]  Since then, they have declassified and released the actual tapes that Ahmad Salam was able to record to protect himself.
[02:35:17.834 --> 02:35:20.775]  And we have some of those clips, if he'd like to go to those.
[02:35:21.135 --> 02:35:25.836]  We have the clip of that very transcript you just heard, but we got cut off by the break.
[02:35:25.856 --> 02:35:26.716]  Those are hard breaks.
[02:35:27.576 --> 02:35:28.117]  Absolutely.
[02:35:28.157 --> 02:35:33.600]  It's not a classic pure false flag where you shoot somebody and then frame somebody else for it.
[02:35:33.880 --> 02:35:46.167]  But in my view, it's still letting it happen, helping them get the bomb together, then having you stand down and not letting you do your job or them not doing their job, and clearly knowing the bombing was coming.
[02:35:46.967 --> 02:35:48.348]  I think that's aiding and abetting it.
[02:35:48.408 --> 02:35:50.849]  And I don't have some dog in the fight to demonize the FBI.
[02:35:51.129 --> 02:35:52.310]  That's a scary organization.
[02:35:52.670 --> 02:35:57.733]  It's just that from the perspective I've got in Oklahoma City and other events, this is something they've done before.
[02:36:01.094 --> 02:36:01.975]  Your take on that, sir?
[02:36:03.035 --> 02:36:03.396]  Yes, sir.
[02:36:05.115 --> 02:36:13.140]  For you to understand what really happened, you need to know how the FBI, the New York office, used to work at that time.
[02:36:13.660 --> 02:36:15.041]  They are two divisions.
[02:36:15.541 --> 02:36:17.603]  Humps and suits.
[02:36:18.757 --> 02:36:25.801]  The Humps is John Antisif and Nancy Floyd and Louis Napoli and Steve Vieira, the special agents.
[02:36:25.881 --> 02:36:33.324]  These are the Humps who sweat on the street, who do their best to protect and clean up American streets.
[02:36:34.085 --> 02:36:43.830]  The suits sitting in their offices, as Mr. Carson Dunbar used to sit in the office, put his legs on the desk and talk from the tip of his nose.
[02:36:44.930 --> 02:36:56.382]  I saw John and Steve Vieira and Nancy Floyd and all of these agents sweating, begging Mr. Danbark to keep me in the cell and continue the investigation.
[02:36:56.482 --> 02:36:58.844]  He said, no, send him home.
[02:36:59.425 --> 02:37:05.070]  And when the bomb went off, he sent the agents to bring me back to go back undercover.
[02:37:06.058 --> 02:37:09.860]  So, I wouldn't throw the blame on the FBI, period.
[02:37:10.501 --> 02:37:16.124]  The listeners and you would like to understand because I was there.
[02:37:16.344 --> 02:37:20.727]  I walked the walk and I talked the talk and I am not afraid of nobody.
[02:37:20.767 --> 02:37:28.992]  If I am afraid, I wouldn't go undercover with assassins and evildoers hiding behind the name of Islam.
[02:37:30.990 --> 02:37:40.919]  These people, I mean, the FBI, with their fight between the management and, of course, today it's a whole different story.
[02:37:40.979 --> 02:37:44.502]  At that time, in the 90s, terrorism was something brand new.
[02:37:45.103 --> 02:37:53.170]  And for them to hear that somebody got orders to build a bomb and go in Manhattan and so on, it is crazy for them.
[02:37:53.690 --> 02:37:57.154]  But I wouldn't throw the blame on the special agents.
[02:37:57.874 --> 02:37:58.574]  I understand.
[02:37:58.595 --> 02:37:59.875]  You're saying it's the bureaucracy.
[02:37:59.915 --> 02:38:01.836]  That's what the late John O'Neill said.
[02:38:02.196 --> 02:38:03.537]  Did you ever talk to John O'Neill?
[02:38:03.557 --> 02:38:15.423]  Because he gave a speech in England months before he died saying, and he was of course the Deputy Director of the FBI, the head of counter-terrorism, for those that don't know, the government's going to let Al Qaeda attack us to take liberties.
[02:38:15.964 --> 02:38:17.144]  A big change is coming.
[02:38:17.525 --> 02:38:21.787]  He quits the FBI, goes to work at the World Trade Center the week of 9-11, and then dies in it.
[02:38:23.988 --> 02:38:25.049]  I mean, this is bizarre.
[02:38:25.069 --> 02:38:37.238]  So let's put bookends on the 93 event and then give us your incredible info and expertise on what's happening in the Middle East, what Barack Obama really stands for, ISIS, all of it.
[02:38:37.959 --> 02:38:38.940]  I'm going to give you the floor, sir.
[02:38:40.021 --> 02:38:42.262]  This is one very important point.
[02:38:42.282 --> 02:38:44.744]  I would like to explain it to your listeners.
[02:38:45.685 --> 02:38:45.985]  Why?
[02:38:47.128 --> 02:38:54.656]  Why President Barack Hussein not hitting hard on the terrorists and on ISIS?
[02:38:55.436 --> 02:38:58.199]  And I know it sounds crazy, but bear with me.
[02:39:00.001 --> 02:39:04.746]  President Barack was born after his older brother, Malik.
[02:39:05.635 --> 02:39:12.140]  The father, Mr. Hussein, named his son Malik, and that's one of God's names in Islam.
[02:39:12.820 --> 02:39:15.142]  The second son, he named him Burak.
[02:39:15.782 --> 02:39:17.203]  What does Burak mean?
[02:39:17.964 --> 02:39:28.191]  Burak is the right Prophet Muhammad, and we can see Mr. Malik sitting with Mr. Obama, visiting him in the White House.
[02:39:28.671 --> 02:39:32.534]  Mr. Malik is in charge of the Muslim Brotherhood in Africa.
[02:39:33.214 --> 02:39:47.371]  There's a lot of finances going on through Mr. Malik, and we can see him in another picture holding the Yemenian dagger on his waist, and he is a big supporter to the Muslim Brotherhood.
[02:39:47.811 --> 02:39:51.035]  And that explains that Mr. Barack
[02:39:51.837 --> 02:39:55.540]  Hussein is not hitting hard on the Muslim Brotherhood.
[02:39:55.840 --> 02:39:59.804]  On the contrary, he took them off the terrorist list.
[02:40:00.264 --> 02:40:06.029]  For years and years, the Muslim Brotherhood is on the terrorist list around the world.
[02:40:06.229 --> 02:40:08.652]  In the Arab world, who knows them best?
[02:40:09.252 --> 02:40:17.337]  But Mr. Barack decided to take them off the terrorist list and start to be sponsoring them and put them in charge of Egypt.
[02:40:17.737 --> 02:40:19.458]  Again, it's the Egyptian population.
[02:40:19.959 --> 02:40:21.280]  I am originally Egyptian.
[02:40:21.700 --> 02:40:27.303]  I have ears and eyes on the roads of Egypt on a minute by minute.
[02:40:27.784 --> 02:40:29.505]  And I know that every Egyptian
[02:40:30.265 --> 02:40:34.690]  Dislike the decision of putting the Muslim Brotherhood in charge of Egypt.
[02:40:34.951 --> 02:40:37.794]  But that's the way Mr. Barack wanted to be.
[02:40:38.215 --> 02:40:43.261]  It took one year and the entire population ripped the Muslim Brotherhood off.
[02:40:44.395 --> 02:40:49.279]  They're taking over the government in Egypt, and now they are in trial in jail.
[02:40:49.799 --> 02:40:50.340]  Guess what?
[02:40:50.620 --> 02:41:01.008]  When Bashar Barak slowed down in his support to the Muslim Brotherhood, they threatened him, and I have that front page Al-Ahram newspaper.
[02:41:01.568 --> 02:41:04.350]  Muslim Brotherhood threatening Obama.
[02:41:04.550 --> 02:41:10.435]  If he stops supporting them, they will release secret documents to put him in prison.
[02:41:10.555 --> 02:41:12.296]  Verbatim words.
[02:41:13.317 --> 02:41:21.403]  Our listeners and our media in America, the mainstream media, will not put that, will not like to hear that.
[02:41:21.503 --> 02:41:34.933]  They don't want to hear... And by the way, Colonel, Ahmad Salam, very famous FBI informant, infiltrator of assassin groups, you name it, successfully helping send him to prison, infiltrating the World Trade Center bombing of 93, if you just joined us.
[02:41:35.934 --> 02:41:43.962]  I've interviewed Dr. Jerome Corsi, I've interviewed Colonel Schaeffer, and I've had a bunch of other sources off-record in Congress, in the Senate.
[02:41:44.582 --> 02:41:52.350]  Everything he's saying, I heard two years ago, before it was even in the Egyptian newspapers, they have Obama's family.
[02:41:53.499 --> 02:41:55.339]  Not just his brother, but Odinga and others.
[02:41:55.800 --> 02:41:59.160]  They're the ones that did the uprisings in Kenya and tried to basically overthrow it.
[02:42:00.061 --> 02:42:00.841]  This is incredible.
[02:42:01.141 --> 02:42:06.882]  And they're siphoning tens of millions a month up to the Muslim Brotherhood in an attempted takeover.
[02:42:06.962 --> 02:42:08.843]  And when I first learned about this, I couldn't believe it.
[02:42:09.103 --> 02:42:10.003]  That a U.S.
[02:42:10.063 --> 02:42:15.664]  President, bare minimum, is being blackmailed by the Muslim Brotherhood to carry all this out.
[02:42:16.804 --> 02:42:18.425]  I mean, it's really happening.
[02:42:19.801 --> 02:42:22.562]  I always thought that would be like Islamophobia or something.
[02:42:22.943 --> 02:42:23.883]  I just couldn't believe it.
[02:42:23.903 --> 02:42:25.004]  It was too big a conspiracy.
[02:42:25.544 --> 02:42:26.504]  Now it's admitted.
[02:42:26.825 --> 02:42:27.925]  So break down.
[02:42:27.965 --> 02:42:39.211]  I mean, so what you're saying is the intel from Egypt, where you were a colonel in intelligence, is that Obama is being blackmailed or is he a willing accomplice of the radical jihadist?
[02:42:40.337 --> 02:42:42.158]  First, I would like to correct one thing.
[02:42:42.278 --> 02:42:44.260]  I'm not a colonel in the intelligence.
[02:42:44.340 --> 02:42:45.421]  It's an honor.
[02:42:45.941 --> 02:42:47.042]  I wouldn't assume it.
[02:42:47.522 --> 02:42:48.743]  I am not in the intelligence.
[02:42:48.763 --> 02:42:52.465]  Well, I just read the New York Times you were a colonel that worked in intelligence and other operations.
[02:42:53.126 --> 02:42:55.948]  No, I am not an intelligence officer.
[02:42:56.428 --> 02:43:00.010]  I have so many friends since I served in the military.
[02:43:00.451 --> 02:43:06.174]  They were serving me in small units and they went to intelligence and we have friendly relations.
[02:43:06.194 --> 02:43:07.615]  Sure, so the New York Times got that wrong.
[02:43:07.675 --> 02:43:09.837]  What was your role as a colonel in the Egyptian Army?
[02:43:10.637 --> 02:43:21.925]  I was in the Arms Ammunition Division, and I was in charge, and I was in the Special Ops, but I was not an intelligence officer.
[02:43:21.965 --> 02:43:24.627]  I want to clear this point quickly.
[02:43:25.187 --> 02:43:27.549]  Mr. Barack Obama's upbringing
[02:43:28.686 --> 02:43:42.225]  With a father who believed in fanaticism to the point that he named his first son Malik, on God's name, and the second son Buraq, which is the right of Prophet Muhammad, and then
[02:43:43.337 --> 02:43:51.960]  He was growing up in this environment as a Muslim and when he came to the United States, let us see, he decided to be Christian.
[02:43:52.440 --> 02:43:53.300]  I'll go for that.
[02:43:53.680 --> 02:43:57.041]  But what kind of church Mr. President went to?
[02:43:57.641 --> 02:43:59.042]  Mr. White's a fanatic.
[02:44:01.052 --> 02:44:06.036]  Priest who is condemning America and going against America.
[02:44:06.776 --> 02:44:09.158]  Mr. Barack's heart is a Muslim.
[02:44:09.358 --> 02:44:12.680]  I have no problem with that because I am a Muslim myself.
[02:44:12.960 --> 02:44:18.564]  But don't go to the fanatics, take them over terrorist list, start supporting them.
[02:44:18.885 --> 02:44:22.407]  And then I have to pay the price as an American citizen.
[02:44:23.388 --> 02:44:25.810]  We are paying the price for
[02:44:27.009 --> 02:44:29.730]  Increasing the power of the Muslim Brotherhood.
[02:44:30.050 --> 02:44:39.554]  The Muslim Brotherhood, as I said, comes from the roots of, or they are the roots of ISIS.
[02:44:40.354 --> 02:44:47.797]  If you go to the ISIS tree, and I can see the ISIS tree, it started from the bottom.
[02:44:49.389 --> 02:44:49.549]  Yes.
[02:45:04.905 --> 02:45:06.146]  Mohammed Abdel Salam.
[02:45:06.166 --> 02:45:23.695]  Mohammed Abdel Salam is the first one who switched the Muslim Brotherhood from being an organization fighting the British occupation during the Nasser era into a violent organization and they attempted to assassinate Jamal Abdel Nasser.
[02:45:23.715 --> 02:45:25.336]  They attempted to assassinate
[02:45:26.176 --> 02:45:27.557]  I don't think so.
[02:45:42.361 --> 02:45:44.703]  God help me to put him in jail.
[02:45:45.484 --> 02:45:56.195]  He was running his organization through Lynn Stewart, his attorney, by making press releases to give orders to his followers in Egypt.
[02:45:56.295 --> 02:46:02.421]  I want to shift gears back to my statement, though, when I described Jerome Corsi, World End Daily, their investigations, saying basically what you said.
[02:46:02.941 --> 02:46:14.693]  Getting back to people in Obama's family financing the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, that horrible overthrow, the burning of the churches, the killing of the military, the end of free speech, all the tyranny that expanded in Egypt.
[02:46:15.154 --> 02:46:19.038]  Do you agree with my statement that bare minimum Obama is being blackmailed?
[02:46:19.058 --> 02:46:20.399]  You said that was in the Egyptian papers?
[02:46:21.340 --> 02:46:25.004]  Yes, he is being blackmailed, but he put himself in that position.
[02:46:27.156 --> 02:46:30.480]  I understand so he was a willing accomplice and then now he's being blackmailed.
[02:46:31.140 --> 02:46:42.532]  Now he's being blackmailed and that's why he stopped the Apache helicopters to go to Egypt and alienated the United States from the entire Arab world.
[02:46:43.133 --> 02:46:44.874]  Egypt is the heart of the Arab world.
[02:46:45.575 --> 02:47:03.980]  Saudi Arabia, Emirates, Dubai, they all surrounding Egypt and now they are pulling out of the United States and Mr. Putin jumping in head down and start to send the Egyptian people now eating caviar once a week by Mr. Putin.
[02:47:04.480 --> 02:47:05.501]  Why he's doing that?
[02:47:05.821 --> 02:47:08.921]  He's taking the opportunity that Mr. Obama is no longer
[02:47:13.466 --> 02:47:16.208]  What do you think the grand strategy is to overthrow Egypt?
[02:47:16.228 --> 02:47:18.729]  That sounds completely insane, but they tried it.
[02:47:18.849 --> 02:47:22.211]  It lasted for one year until 20 million people hit the streets.
[02:47:22.932 --> 02:47:28.175]  I mean, why would Obama want to put people in charge that were crucifying Christians in the streets for no reason?
[02:47:28.515 --> 02:47:28.856]  Why?
[02:47:29.816 --> 02:47:40.361]  Well, he's not per se wanted to crucify Christians, but he is heartedly supporting the Muslim Brotherhood, who will kill Christians, as you just mentioned.
[02:47:41.062 --> 02:47:45.144]  And they continue to do that until the military took over Egypt.
[02:47:45.564 --> 02:47:48.606]  And now Egypt is being alienated from the United States.
[02:47:49.086 --> 02:47:56.670]  The main goal, the final goal, is to have American control, Islamic control over Africa.
[02:47:57.472 --> 02:47:58.373]  That's it, that's yep.
[02:47:58.993 --> 02:48:00.054]  That is Africa.
[02:48:00.535 --> 02:48:09.222]  The goal, and that is what Dr. Isam Al Haddad was sent by Mr. Khairat Al Shater from Egypt to the United States to the White House.
[02:48:09.763 --> 02:48:16.268]  Have the instruction from the White House, go back to Egypt and start to go back to Mr. Malik.
[02:48:18.591 --> 02:48:24.896]  Exactly, but not genuine Islam as you said.
[02:48:24.936 --> 02:48:29.801]  This radical form with criminal elements of our government backing it as a secret army.
[02:48:29.941 --> 02:48:31.182]  I think that's clear.
[02:48:31.482 --> 02:48:33.844]  Getting into other perspectives on ISIS.
[02:48:35.045 --> 02:48:40.290]  On Obama and others being caught helping fund them, is that blowback now when they go into Iraq?
[02:48:40.330 --> 02:48:46.574]  What's the inside intel as an Egyptian colonel and an FBI asset?
[02:48:46.875 --> 02:48:50.518]  What's your expert take on what's happening currently and what we saw in Paris?
[02:48:51.368 --> 02:48:57.432]  Well, as you know, that the head of ISIS was one of our prisoners in Guantanamo.
[02:48:57.452 --> 02:48:57.813]  Yes.
[02:48:58.253 --> 02:48:59.374]  And then we released him.
[02:48:59.494 --> 02:49:04.057]  And then we say, oops, there is so many oopses been going on.
[02:49:04.077 --> 02:49:09.161]  After we released Mr. al-Baghdadi, we say, oops, and then
[02:49:09.941 --> 02:49:13.303]  And today, everybody works for his own best interest.
[02:49:13.664 --> 02:49:23.330]  Of course, Mr. al-Baghdadi created his followers, which is originally supported by the Muslim Brotherhood, backed up by Hamas in Palestine.
[02:49:24.111 --> 02:49:27.473]  Hamas is the military arm of the Muslim Brotherhood.
[02:49:27.913 --> 02:49:29.474]  They are all connected.
[02:49:29.615 --> 02:49:30.875]  It is one tree.
[02:49:31.076 --> 02:49:32.617]  It started from Egypt.
[02:49:33.397 --> 02:49:39.203]  Under one leadership, and that is the Prince of Jihad, the blind Sheikh, Sheikh Omar Abdul Rahman.
[02:49:39.624 --> 02:49:40.985]  I'm going to tell you one thing.
[02:49:41.125 --> 02:49:43.828]  I'm following Sheikh Omar Abdul Rahman very closely.
[02:49:44.308 --> 02:49:56.020]  And sadly, for the first time since 20 years ago, he was taken out of prison, put in a hospital to prepare for his, what they call it, transfer.
[02:49:57.523 --> 02:50:01.164]  At the beginning, the State Department said, oh, we're going to release him.
[02:50:01.324 --> 02:50:02.905]  And then the media went crazy.
[02:50:02.965 --> 02:50:06.346]  You cannot release the guy who has American blood on his hands.
[02:50:06.486 --> 02:50:08.827]  Oh, well, we will transfer him.
[02:50:08.847 --> 02:50:11.868]  This is ridiculous!
[02:50:11.888 --> 02:50:13.009]  Kidney has just been executed?
[02:50:14.552 --> 02:50:20.137]  I don't know about the capital punishment in New York.
[02:50:20.638 --> 02:50:22.179]  The guy should be in prison.
[02:50:22.319 --> 02:50:23.581]  He is not in prison.
[02:50:24.241 --> 02:50:26.183]  I will bet you something here.
[02:50:27.124 --> 02:50:30.507]  We have two or a year and three quarter left to Mr. Barack.
[02:50:30.887 --> 02:50:37.253]  He will release the Sheikh before he leave office to shut the Muslim Brotherhood forever.
[02:50:38.654 --> 02:50:39.976]  And you can quote me on that.
[02:50:41.576 --> 02:50:42.196]  Incredible.
[02:50:42.316 --> 02:50:44.998]  Sir, we've only got like six minutes left in the next segment.
[02:50:45.018 --> 02:50:45.978]  We can do a little bit of overdrive.
[02:50:46.039 --> 02:50:58.645]  I want to have you back for an in-depth, commercial-free, hour-long special sometime on the nightly news to really give you the floor with all the documents and articles you've sent us to kind of do a live presentation sometime.
[02:50:58.685 --> 02:50:59.446]  Maybe a tape once.
[02:50:59.466 --> 02:51:02.107]  We can add more video to break all this down.
[02:51:02.147 --> 02:51:03.448]  But amazing perspective.
[02:51:03.948 --> 02:51:07.190]  And from my own deep research of everything, I really can't disagree with anything you've said.
[02:51:07.690 --> 02:51:08.831]  It's just so over-the-top.
[02:51:08.891 --> 02:51:10.232]  Reality is so amazing.
[02:51:10.652 --> 02:51:14.493]  The CDC just announced flu vaccines may have the wrong strain of flu virus.
[02:51:14.713 --> 02:51:15.873]  You may not be protected.

[02:52:38.249 --> 02:52:39.149]  Not our iodine.
[02:52:39.249 --> 02:52:42.830]  It comes from over 200 million year old crystal salt deposits.

[02:54:17.840 --> 02:54:20.824]  Alex Jones here live in the final main broadcast segment.
[02:54:20.844 --> 02:54:34.560]  We'll do one more segment of Overdrive with our guest Ahmad Salam, former Egyptian military colonel, but undercover with the FBI infiltrated the first Al Qaeda cell on American soil in New York City.
[02:54:35.121 --> 02:54:36.422]  He also infiltrated the Russians.
[02:54:37.568 --> 02:54:54.913]  When you think about this, what type of country would elect somebody who you don't even know really where they're from, and then they've got all these brothers in people, and cousins that are radicals, who've been caught trying to basically overthrow Kenya before?
[02:54:57.754 --> 02:55:00.095]  Man, this country is in trouble.
[02:55:01.275 --> 02:55:04.876]  And then they did overthrow Egypt for a year, and had a reign of terror!
[02:55:07.133 --> 02:55:12.597]  And I used to hear all the right-wingers talk about this, and I just would roll my eyes, because people call me a conspiracy theorist.
[02:55:14.739 --> 02:55:17.261]  Sometimes truth is so strange, I can't even believe it.
[02:55:17.841 --> 02:55:19.022]  Everybody should get his book.
[02:55:19.142 --> 02:55:26.888]  It is a page-turner, undercover, Ahmad Salam, the untold story of Al-Qaeda, the FBI, and the CIA in America.
[02:55:26.908 --> 02:55:29.950]  Ahmadsalam.org.
[02:55:30.451 --> 02:55:35.174]  We'll tweet out Ahmad Salam, S-A-L-E-M, it's like Salem, Ahmadsalam.org.
[02:55:37.833 --> 02:55:38.834]  So you can get his book.
[02:55:39.234 --> 02:55:39.955]  Let me ask you this.
[02:55:40.015 --> 02:55:43.638]  I want to get back to the Paris situation and what's happening and going on.
[02:55:43.978 --> 02:55:52.945]  But you were saying off-air, one of my producers, you can say this in your own words, about, I mean, did you say that Obama and others are trying to radicalize Islam?
[02:55:53.285 --> 02:55:54.366]  What's your view on that?
[02:55:54.426 --> 02:55:57.749]  And some of the Wahhabis out of Saudi Arabia, what's the agenda there?
[02:55:58.680 --> 02:56:04.043]  Well, I think that Mr. Obama's heart is for the radical Islam.
[02:56:04.583 --> 02:56:11.047]  But of course, he has to show the presidency for the American people completely.
[02:56:11.588 --> 02:56:22.514]  But all of his behavior, it just shows his support to the Muslim Brotherhood, which is against the Egyptian peoples and against their wishes.
[02:56:22.934 --> 02:56:23.414]  Today, the
[02:56:24.631 --> 02:56:34.537]  United States of America being alienated from Egypt, from Saudi Arabia, from Dubai, from the only country with United States at this time is Qatar.
[02:56:34.937 --> 02:56:42.282]  And when we took the five Taliban leader and released them, they are fanatics and radicals.
[02:56:42.462 --> 02:56:46.565]  And you gotta imagine if these people today leaving
[02:56:47.759 --> 02:56:49.580]  ISIS from Qatar or not.
[02:56:50.141 --> 02:56:55.565]  You cannot in the day of the internet to control what they will say and to who would they say.
[02:56:56.085 --> 02:57:01.449]  I think Mr. Obama, I have no problem for him to be loving to Islam.
[02:57:01.529 --> 02:57:02.670]  I am a Muslim myself.
[02:57:03.070 --> 02:57:12.817]  But please, Mr. Barack, please do not go for the fanatics and the radicals because it bounce back to America.
[02:57:13.197 --> 02:57:14.699]  America is being hated.
[02:57:15.638 --> 02:57:21.503]  As a government, not at the American people, in the Middle East, because of what you have been doing.
[02:57:21.543 --> 02:57:24.145]  Oh yeah, Pakistan is mad at us for supporting radicals.
[02:57:24.446 --> 02:57:26.768]  People act like the Middle East loves radicals, they hate them.
[02:57:27.949 --> 02:57:32.032]  Unfortunately, that's the price the American people, you and I, will pay.
[02:57:32.793 --> 02:57:41.640]  That we get alienated from the Middle East, and when we go ask them to help us to fight ISIS, of course they say, if you're coming to support
[02:57:42.597 --> 02:57:45.740]  A terrorist organization called the Muslim Brotherhood.
[02:57:46.060 --> 02:57:46.881]  You coming now?
[02:57:47.261 --> 02:57:50.544]  One of the tales of the Muslim Brotherhood, which is ISIS.
[02:57:50.864 --> 02:57:52.305]  You want us to help you fight it?
[02:57:52.725 --> 02:57:53.126]  Sorry.
[02:57:53.706 --> 02:57:54.707]  And they walk away.
[02:57:54.727 --> 02:58:00.332]  And they went far from the United States to get their weapons from Russia and from China.
[02:58:00.932 --> 02:58:02.634]  And then, lo and behold,
[02:58:03.908 --> 02:58:10.913]  Russia will start to spread their wings on the Middle East, and we lose our leadership role around the world.
[02:58:11.393 --> 02:58:31.366]  America, I immigrated to, is the United States of America, and it is the supreme power on the planet, and we should maintain that, increase the military power, and increase our leadership around the planet, not to shy from being American.
[02:58:31.827 --> 02:58:33.128]  I am proud to be one.
[02:58:34.028 --> 02:58:35.289]  It was my choice!
[02:58:36.571 --> 02:58:38.653]  And I will maintain it to the day I die.
[02:58:38.873 --> 02:58:40.094]  I'm not afraid to die.
[02:58:40.114 --> 02:58:43.618]  If I'm afraid to die, I wouldn't go... Wow, that's powerful, Ahmad Salam.
[02:58:43.638 --> 02:58:50.345]  Well, nobody can debate that the government's destroying American power everywhere on purpose for global government to replace it.
[02:58:50.725 --> 02:58:51.746]  That's the master plan.
[02:58:51.826 --> 02:58:52.887]  Five more minutes with our guest.
[02:58:53.388 --> 02:58:54.769]  Nightly News tonight, 7 o'clock.
[02:58:55.470 --> 02:58:56.331]  Powerful interview.
[02:59:00.515 --> 02:59:03.717]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[02:59:04.018 --> 02:59:12.044]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[02:59:12.264 --> 02:59:17.307]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[02:59:17.688 --> 02:59:19.989]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?

[03:00:23.041 --> 03:00:23.962]  Fix bayonets.
[03:00:24.562 --> 03:00:26.483]  We are now entering overdrive.
[03:00:26.943 --> 03:00:31.586]  With your host, Alex Jones broadcasting live from the front lines.
[03:00:32.147 --> 03:00:35.789]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:00:37.865 --> 03:00:40.528]  Undercover, the book available at Amazon.com is powerful.
[03:00:40.548 --> 03:00:43.030]  He's got a new book out on the run.
[03:00:43.050 --> 03:00:45.292]  We're gonna have him back up in the next month or so.
[03:00:45.312 --> 03:00:49.016]  We'd like to come on to discuss that new book and tell us what that's about.
[03:00:50.077 --> 03:00:51.898]  But Ahmaud Salem is our guest.
[03:00:51.958 --> 03:00:54.561]  Final segment, about five minutes here left with you, sir.
[03:00:54.961 --> 03:00:59.365]  I want to give you the floor to talk about anything else you want to get into, but briefly I wanted to ask you about...
[03:01:00.706 --> 03:01:09.891]  The agenda we're seeing with this attack on the cartoon, and obviously it's obnoxious, really hateful stuff, but that place is connected to different intelligence agencies.
[03:01:10.351 --> 03:01:21.818]  It seems like there's an attempt to cause provocations and a clash of civilization to try to root the United States out of the Middle East, and that seems to be what Obama is doing as well.
[03:01:22.278 --> 03:01:24.299]  What do you think the grand strategy is here?
[03:01:25.926 --> 03:01:27.768]  I don't know about the grand strategy.
[03:01:27.808 --> 03:01:31.330]  I'm not privy to this intel, but I will tell you something.
[03:01:31.430 --> 03:01:42.697]  It makes me very suspicious to hear the assassins who commit the evil doers who commit this massacre saying, Oh, we are Al-Qaeda from Yemen.
[03:01:43.258 --> 03:01:43.738]  Oh, really?
[03:01:43.758 --> 03:01:54.986]  If that is what you go to announce yourself in advance before you go kill 12 people that you are coming representing Al-Qaeda from Yemen, or that's just
[03:01:55.786 --> 03:02:03.495]  And a road to go and probably, probably, I'm not so sure about that, invade Yemen.
[03:02:04.135 --> 03:02:04.636]  I don't know.
[03:02:04.876 --> 03:02:05.557]  I agree.
[03:02:05.597 --> 03:02:07.939]  No, clearly, this whole thing stings to heaven.
[03:02:08.260 --> 03:02:10.722]  I don't know the truth about it, but it isn't adding up.
[03:02:11.183 --> 03:02:13.986]  As more stuff comes in, we've got an open mind here.
[03:02:14.286 --> 03:02:16.569]  Other points you'd like to make, sir, and tell us about your new book.
[03:02:17.526 --> 03:02:19.727]  My new book is talking about my life.
[03:02:19.907 --> 03:02:28.809]  I'm living under assumed identity for the last 25 years, which it takes a big toll on my family and myself.
[03:02:28.829 --> 03:02:34.231]  Every once in a while, we get assumed identity, new assumed identity.
[03:02:34.251 --> 03:02:35.551]  You start from the scratch.
[03:02:36.011 --> 03:02:37.711]  We move from state to state.
[03:02:37.792 --> 03:02:40.312]  We moved 15 times.
[03:02:41.152 --> 03:02:42.233]  It cost money.
[03:02:42.413 --> 03:02:43.613]  It caused pain.
[03:02:43.713 --> 03:02:44.753]  It caused suffering.
[03:02:44.773 --> 03:02:45.654]  And, um,
[03:02:47.114 --> 03:02:52.476]  I choose to do that because six people got killed in the first bombing in 1993.
[03:02:52.516 --> 03:02:53.056]  I am confident if Mr.
[03:03:01.769 --> 03:03:06.971]  FBI, ASAC, Mr. Dan Barr, let me to continue the investigation.
[03:03:06.991 --> 03:03:16.375]  I will be the one who continue to build the bomb under the eyes of the FBI as we did in the other five bombs in the day of terror trial.
[03:03:16.835 --> 03:03:30.601]  I went back undercover and the people underground came and we built five bombs under the supervision of the FBI and the vacuum surveillance and we substitute the real explosives with just
[03:03:31.241 --> 03:03:33.862]  Harmful liquids and fertilizer.
[03:03:34.282 --> 03:03:36.103]  And they arrested all of them.
[03:03:36.583 --> 03:03:38.244]  Twelve of them got arrested.
[03:03:39.145 --> 03:03:43.607]  And that's why I wrote my first book to reveal the reality.
[03:03:44.107 --> 03:03:59.394]  It really hurt me bad that Mr. Dan Barth sent me to go work covertly and then he released an article in the New York Post, or at least I think, I don't have the proof yet,
[03:04:00.174 --> 03:04:02.314]  I think he is the one who made that release.
[03:04:02.655 --> 03:04:05.795]  Because this is a covert operation in the JTTF.
[03:04:06.295 --> 03:04:12.337]  How is a reporter in the New York Post will know about it a month before we took the case down?
[03:04:12.757 --> 03:04:18.318]  And I insist to continue because I don't want another three, four thousand people to get killed.
[03:04:19.818 --> 03:04:23.319]  But Mr. Carson Danbar has to
[03:04:24.798 --> 03:04:30.799]  Release to the New York Post that we have undercover operation with a fanatic.
[03:04:31.259 --> 03:04:36.421]  That was crazy and that would make other Muslims afraid to step forward.
[03:04:36.441 --> 03:04:46.423]  Well, I agree and now that ISIS is spreading all over the world, I would expect they're going to be attacking or their copycats are all over the place and they can take American liberties.
[03:04:46.783 --> 03:04:50.724]  I want to invite you back on to do a whole hour in a month or so, sir, to talk about
[03:04:51.304 --> 03:04:52.605]  Life under an assumed identity.
[03:04:52.625 --> 03:04:57.569]  I know you broke that today to come on with your real name and do this, so be safe out there.
[03:04:58.209 --> 03:05:01.592]  Have a great weekend that's coming up and God bless you.
[03:05:01.612 --> 03:05:02.732]  We appreciate your courage, sir.
[03:05:03.253 --> 03:05:04.053]  Thank you, Mr. Alex.
[03:05:04.614 --> 03:05:05.414]  Wow, powerful.
[03:05:05.594 --> 03:05:09.777]  You can go to his website, ladies and gentlemen, and we have that linked on InfoWars.com.
[03:05:11.579 --> 03:05:15.622]  You pick up the receiver with your heart racing and sweat homeland loads of ammo.
[03:05:15.762 --> 03:05:17.303]  At the same time, the restricting
