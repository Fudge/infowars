[00:00:10.313 --> 00:00:18.777]  Not being satisfied with laser weapons that are both invisible and silent, companies like Boeing have announced that they're going to be taking their laser weapons to the next level.
[00:00:20.198 --> 00:00:27.122]  Previously, operators have had to pay close attention to know exactly when they've been firing these silent but deadly weapons.
[00:00:27.782 --> 00:00:32.427]  Now their lasers will be equipped with Star Trek and Star Wars sound effects.
[00:00:32.848 --> 00:00:41.778]  So next time Boeing's high-energy laser mobile demonstrator shoots down a drone mid-flight, it's gonna sound exactly like Han Solo's blaster.
[00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:45.281]  But that isn't all that science fiction has influenced.
[00:00:45.661 --> 00:00:55.406]  In addition to cell phones and ion propulsion and handheld devices, Star Trek and Star Wars have also influenced futurists like Ray Kurzweil.
[00:00:55.747 --> 00:01:00.730]  Kurzweil is once again repeating his prediction that humans will meld with computers in the future.
[00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:07.073]  But instead of 2045, Kurzweil is now suggesting cyborgs will be a reality by the 2030s.
[00:01:08.334 --> 00:01:19.061]  The director of engineering at Google said that people will soon be able to connect their brains directly to the cloud and augment their existing intelligence with thousands of computers.
[00:01:19.361 --> 00:01:26.846]  Thanks to DNA nanobots making the connection, our thinking will become a hybrid of biological and non-biological thinking.
[00:01:27.267 --> 00:01:33.671]  Kurzweil adds that by the early 2040s, people will be more like machines than they will be human.
[00:01:33.911 --> 00:01:38.014]  And he even suggests that we'll be able to back up our brains like a hard drive.
[00:01:38.554 --> 00:01:39.294]  But guess what?
[00:01:39.655 --> 00:01:43.036]  Star Trek already conquered this territory in the 90s.
[00:01:43.636 --> 00:01:44.496]  I am the Borg.
[00:01:45.037 --> 00:01:53.460]  The cyborg represents the dark side of humanity, what happens when technology falls into the wrong hands and is used to dehumanize us.
[00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:57.123]  The Star Trek Borgs became one with their technology.
[00:01:57.503 --> 00:02:00.425]  It stripped them of their humanity and their individuality.
[00:02:00.886 --> 00:02:03.067]  They became like zombies in a metal shell.
[00:02:03.408 --> 00:02:12.015]  They were now part of a collective network on a vast computer system, controlled telepathically by this mysterious Borg Queen.
[00:02:12.335 --> 00:02:22.103]  Kind of makes you think there's a possibility something could be telepathically controlling us if we ever were to upload our brains to the cloud, as Kurzweil suggests.
[00:02:22.503 --> 00:02:23.884]  Assimilate this.
[00:02:26.546 --> 00:02:33.552]  And even though we hear the word singularity by 2045, the fact is, man merging with machine has already happened.
[00:02:33.952 --> 00:02:39.777]  Professor Kevin Warwick is head of the cybernetics and robotics department at Reading University in the UK.
[00:02:40.397 --> 00:02:47.222]  In 1998, he was able to connect his nervous system to the internet via a chip implanted in his arm.
[00:02:47.623 --> 00:02:51.426]  He then used the web to allow him to control a robotic arm.
[00:02:51.846 --> 00:02:52.807]  And that was in the 90s.
[00:02:53.167 --> 00:03:02.397]  And he, like Kurzweil and other transhumanists, give this ominous warning that by not upgrading, we would be considered subspecies in the future.
[00:03:02.998 --> 00:03:10.146]  And surprise, surprise, artificial intelligence is one of the topics up for discussion at this year's Bilderberg Conference.
[00:03:10.706 --> 00:03:15.813]  Former DARPA director and now Google exec Regina Dugan will be in attendance.
[00:03:16.234 --> 00:03:22.062]  Dugan is helping to develop and promote the idea of an ingestible identification microchip.
[00:03:22.342 --> 00:03:27.149]  Yeah, absolutely not worrisome at all that Google is now hiring military leadership.
[00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:41.336]  Users would swallow a chip in pill form every day in order to obtain the superpower of having their entire body act as a biological password for cell phones, cars, doors, and other devices.
[00:03:41.836 --> 00:03:49.480]  But I'm sure it means absolutely nothing that artificial intelligence will be discussed this week at a top secret meeting of the world's power brokers.
[00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:59.431]  When people like Elon Musk and Stephen Hawking have warned that artificial intelligence has the potential to destroy humanity if it falls in the wrong hands.
[00:03:59.771 --> 00:04:01.894]  I have one simple request.
[00:04:02.594 --> 00:04:07.220]  And that is to have sharks with frickin' laser beams attached to their heads!
