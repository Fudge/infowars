[00:00:00.786 --> 00:00:03.488]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:11.895 --> 00:00:17.099]  The Lord knows I can't change.
[00:00:17.159 --> 00:00:21.722]  The Lord won't help me.
[00:00:21.842 --> 00:00:26.646]  I can't change.
[00:00:27.347 --> 00:00:28.287]  Alex Jones.
[00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.363]  Well, it's hard to believe that it's already the sixth day of December 2015.
[00:00:46.403 --> 00:00:49.166]  Less than a month left in 2015.
[00:00:49.326 --> 00:00:52.930]  It's Sunday, four o'clock Central Standard Time.
[00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:54.351]  We are broadcasting worldwide.
[00:00:54.972 --> 00:00:56.233]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:00:57.154 --> 00:01:01.078]  Joe Biggs and crew are on the ground in San Bernardino, California.
[00:01:01.098 --> 00:01:02.219]  They've been there since yesterday.
[00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:05.903]  And they have been interviewing members of
[00:01:07.786 --> 00:01:17.574]  Mrs. Malik and Mr. Farooq's mosque, the two confirmed mass murderers from the attacks last week.
[00:01:19.356 --> 00:01:25.981]  They have also been visiting different Islamic centers around the country and different reported training camps in Michigan, in upstate New York.
[00:01:26.001 --> 00:01:29.524]  They will continue next week to other states and other areas.
[00:01:32.332 --> 00:01:42.277]  They will be joining us coming up in the third segment, fourth segment, and fifth segment of the first hour today.
[00:01:43.318 --> 00:01:46.339]  We will have open phones in the second hour.
[00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:50.181]  Here, obviously, is the big news right now.
[00:01:51.262 --> 00:02:01.267]  Barack Hussein Obama is set to give a speech coming up at
[00:02:03.881 --> 00:02:14.011]  7 o'clock Central, 8 o'clock Eastern, where he reportedly is going to demonize the Second Amendment and call for massive draconian gun control.
[00:02:14.031 --> 00:02:25.422]  Kurt Nemo details the statements by the White House, CBS News, the Attorney General, and others in an article titled, Obama to Deliver Primetime Address Sunday on Gun Control.
[00:02:26.681 --> 00:02:32.862]  Now I shot a special video about two hours ago that's on Infowars.com.
[00:02:32.962 --> 00:02:36.663]  Emergency Obama to announce massive gun restrictions in speech.
[00:02:37.703 --> 00:02:41.924]  And some people in the comments are saying, where does it say he's going to announce more gun control?
[00:02:44.304 --> 00:02:46.484]  Well, go read the article at Infowars.com.
[00:02:47.705 --> 00:02:49.885]  Here's one right here from NBC News.
[00:02:51.965 --> 00:02:52.646]  NBC News.
[00:02:53.566 --> 00:02:55.166]  This is up on Infowars.com.
[00:02:56.863 --> 00:03:02.827]  Attorney General Lynch, President, will call on Congress to take actions on guns in San Bernardino Address.
[00:03:03.447 --> 00:03:06.289]  That's going to be a famous name, the San Bernardino Address.
[00:03:08.991 --> 00:03:12.773]  That the highest priority is to restrict the Second Amendment to protect the American people.
[00:03:13.874 --> 00:03:14.434]  That's a quote.
[00:03:16.836 --> 00:03:18.517]  So, get ready, folks.
[00:03:18.577 --> 00:03:20.538]  We know they've been coming for a long time.
[00:03:21.018 --> 00:03:21.959]  We know they've geared up.
[00:03:21.999 --> 00:03:24.901]  They've tripled the size of the ATF, the BATF.
[00:03:26.035 --> 00:03:28.437]  They are brainwashing the Second Amendment across the board.
[00:03:28.457 --> 00:03:43.989]  They are lowering our borders, bringing in radical jihadis, letting them attack, covering up for days it's a terror attack, and then moving to restrict the Second Amendment for the average American.
[00:03:44.878 --> 00:03:51.744]  This is the suspension of common sense, the suspension of reality, but it's the crisis they're going to use to take our basic freedoms.
[00:03:51.784 --> 00:04:02.452]  Now, Obama said earlier this last week, a day before the attacks in San Bernardino, that there was no terror threat in America and there was no ISIS threat.
[00:04:04.334 --> 00:04:08.678]  That's because they want the terror cells that they've deployed from Africa to Asia
[00:04:09.735 --> 00:04:16.097]  And all of the Middle East and Europe and North America to get in place first before they launch their major operations.
[00:04:16.597 --> 00:04:29.481]  Now, they're not run by the government, but they've been funded, protected, basically bred and prepared in Syria and in Iraq, and that are now allowed entry into Turkey, into Europe, into the United States.
[00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:34.304]  And that's the former head of defense intelligence and others coming out and saying that.
[00:04:34.765 --> 00:04:47.903]  When you see the former head of defense intelligence, who was still the director earlier this year, come out and say the president ordered us to help create ISIS, knowingly, consciously, that is a huge whistleblower.
[00:04:49.036 --> 00:04:51.777]  And the head of South Com's basically coming out in warning as well.
[00:04:52.277 --> 00:04:54.118]  That's because they're not involved in this, folks.
[00:04:54.678 --> 00:04:59.941]  This is criminal mafia elements, similar to Cobra, Spectre, things you see in Hollywood.
[00:04:59.961 --> 00:05:03.962]  But those Hollywood character groups are based off real stuff, okay?
[00:05:04.662 --> 00:05:06.423]  And that's who's quarterbacking ISIS.
[00:05:06.603 --> 00:05:08.044]  They are here, they're getting ready to strike.
[00:05:09.778 --> 00:05:12.980]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:21.325]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:05:21.525 --> 00:05:26.569]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[00:05:26.969 --> 00:05:29.250]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?

[00:05:39.811 --> 00:05:44.014]  Used since before the days of the Roman Empire to support the body's natural systems.
[00:05:44.174 --> 00:05:48.137]  Introducing the new Infowarslife.com oil of oregano formulation.
[00:05:48.337 --> 00:05:53.100]  We have now procured the most high quality and potent forms of oregano oil on the market.

[00:06:04.868 --> 00:06:06.689]  That's Infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:06:10.663 --> 00:06:11.244]  We've got it.
[00:06:11.284 --> 00:06:17.429]  This transmission is coming to you.
[00:06:17.789 --> 00:06:19.891]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:06:22.193 --> 00:06:27.838]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:06:57.562 --> 00:07:03.185]  And I would add, by the way, these are the same folks oftentimes who suggest that they're so tough that
[00:07:05.011 --> 00:07:10.755]  Just talking to Putin or staring down ISIL or using some additional rhetoric somehow is going to solve the problems out there.
[00:07:11.635 --> 00:07:20.121]  But apparently they're scared of widows and orphans coming into the United States of America as part of our tradition of compassion.
[00:07:24.144 --> 00:07:27.746]  At first they were worried about the press being too tough on them during debates.
[00:07:27.826 --> 00:07:31.269]  Now they're worried about three-year-old orphans.
[00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:34.451]  Okay, there is President Obama.
[00:07:35.538 --> 00:07:55.812]  On November 18th, in Turkey, at the Big G20 Summit, openly saying that the United States is scared of widows and orphans, and that we're trying to break our tradition of having compassionate hearts and an open door.
[00:07:56.672 --> 00:08:03.317]  If you came here from anywhere in the world, you had to wait three months at Ellis Island to make sure you didn't have TB or black plague or something else.
[00:08:05.493 --> 00:08:12.135]  And no one from a country or a region at war with us was ever admitted openly and without being checked to this country.
[00:08:14.395 --> 00:08:24.437]  But we've seen a woman blow herself up with a suicide belt in Paris two weeks ago while my reporters were down the street and kill a police dog.
[00:08:24.477 --> 00:08:31.439]  We've seen a woman, Tashin Malik, lead the attack
[00:08:32.486 --> 00:08:44.716]  The New York Post and Associated Press report, in command of her husband, Saeed Farooq, killing 14 of his co-workers, picking out the Jewish and Christian ones, it's now confirmed, for execution.
[00:08:44.776 --> 00:08:46.838]  He told them, you will soon die.
[00:08:47.498 --> 00:08:49.420]  And of course, no political correctness stopped it.
[00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:56.566]  It's now come out that the city of San Bernardino, neighbors and others, dare not report or say anything, because after all,
[00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:03.003]  If you're a foreigner, if you've got brown skin, if you're a Muslim, you are above the law.
[00:09:03.763 --> 00:09:05.444]  And your passports will not even be checked.
[00:09:07.266 --> 00:09:19.153]  Just two weeks ago, even CNN reported a plane load of 140 plus people flown in out of Mexico to JFK and allowed to pass without even showing any ID.
[00:09:19.173 --> 00:09:25.818]  Oh, but we're going to hear tonight from the President's address how he's going to take our rights away to keep us safe, but
[00:09:28.151 --> 00:09:29.611]  The Second Amendment's gotta go.
[00:09:30.792 --> 00:09:33.853]  It's its fault that radical jihadists are killing everybody.
[00:09:34.093 --> 00:09:39.775]  Well, funny, Syria has a ban on guns in citizens' hands, and they got invaded by a jihad force out of Saudi Arabia.
[00:09:40.435 --> 00:09:55.880]  Funny, France has incredibly restrictive gun laws, and all these terror attacks they've had the last year were illegal guns smuggled into the country that has open borders, and it turns out the lead terrorists were on watch list and allowed in to France.
[00:10:00.934 --> 00:10:02.515]  Isn't that disgusting?
[00:10:03.115 --> 00:10:10.340]  And now the President is set to give what the Attorney General, Lynch, is calling the Bernardino Address.
[00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:12.922]  The San Bernardino Address.
[00:10:15.203 --> 00:10:24.529]  Where they are going to put citizens outside of law, outside of judges, outside of juries, outside of charges, on no-gun-by list,
[00:10:26.084 --> 00:10:34.607]  There are over 2 million citizens on it, 70 plus members of Homeland Security, 6 members of Congress, last time I checked, who can't fly.
[00:10:34.987 --> 00:10:37.807]  Not just you're on a no-fly list, they can't even fly.
[00:10:38.228 --> 00:10:39.448]  They're beyond a watch list.
[00:10:40.708 --> 00:10:41.309]  For no reason.
[00:10:42.009 --> 00:10:46.610]  And you can't find out why you're on it, you can't get off of it, because it's a shadow government.
[00:10:46.810 --> 00:10:52.532]  Who needs courts when you've got a shadow government that completes the smuggling process for millions of illegals coming in every year?
[00:10:53.905 --> 00:11:07.667]  Who brings in the millions, the millions in Europe, the hundreds of thousands out of Syria, the Sunnis, 99 plus percent out of batches of hundreds and in some cases thousands of immigrants that come here.
[00:11:08.971 --> 00:11:13.895]  With no IDs or fake IDs, not one of them is Christian, not one of them is Shiite.
[00:11:14.276 --> 00:11:29.489]  They are all, in many cases, Sunni invaders out of Saudi Arabia and Iraq that came in to take land and take farms and take homes in Syria and murder Christians and murder Shiites and murder other minority groups on record.
[00:11:30.490 --> 00:11:32.412]  And now the Russians have kicked their butts.
[00:11:33.464 --> 00:11:38.268]  And so they're running into Turkey and Turkey is taking them and bringing them into Europe.
[00:11:38.308 --> 00:11:43.932]  They're a member of the EU and then they're flying here to the United States or they're flying to Mexico and walking across the border.
[00:11:44.152 --> 00:11:45.974]  And I have the head of Southcom admitting it.
[00:11:46.254 --> 00:11:47.115]  I have video of that.
[00:11:47.455 --> 00:11:48.276]  I have it all.
[00:11:50.197 --> 00:11:52.719]  But it doesn't matter when our government brings in foreigners.
[00:11:52.739 --> 00:11:55.041]  This woman only been here a few months from Saudi Arabia.
[00:11:56.582 --> 00:11:57.643]  The leader of the attack.
[00:11:58.203 --> 00:11:59.204]  Let's put her on screen.
[00:11:59.625 --> 00:12:01.766]  Let's put, for TV viewers, radio slash TV,
[00:12:03.226 --> 00:12:04.447]  Tashin Malik.
[00:12:04.707 --> 00:12:05.707]  Let's put her up there.
[00:12:08.048 --> 00:12:13.190]  And she came to America and she led the attack and killed 14 people and then threw pipe bombs at police.
[00:12:13.590 --> 00:12:20.853]  And for two and a half days, the controlled corporate media of CNN and MSNBC said, conspiracy theorists says it's Islamic.
[00:12:21.213 --> 00:12:25.395]  Conspiracy theorists say it's... No, you mean people that actually sent reporters to California?
[00:12:26.215 --> 00:12:27.756]  You mean folks that actually did the research?
[00:12:28.076 --> 00:12:30.437]  We were reporting first the day it happened.
[00:12:33.015 --> 00:12:40.221]  That he had a Middle Easterner surname and had been connected to Facebook posts and things, pledging allegiance to ISIS.
[00:12:45.666 --> 00:12:49.309]  So think about that, and think about that long and hard.
[00:12:50.290 --> 00:12:54.414]  And then it turns out, I'm not saying it's a total false flag, but let me tell you, it's getting suspicious.
[00:12:54.794 --> 00:12:56.656]  They had an anti-terror shooting drill.
[00:12:57.836 --> 00:12:59.957]  Going on at the exact same time it happened.
[00:13:00.297 --> 00:13:01.417]  That's the Associated Press.
[00:13:02.237 --> 00:13:10.340]  And the guns, a bunch of the guns they got, were legally bought through a background check from a private seller, but were police issued.
[00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:11.580]  That is confirmed.
[00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:14.081]  That's been on NBC News as well.
[00:13:15.396 --> 00:13:33.427]  So it looks like everything was done to open the door to let these people do it because common sense is suspended and they'll now blame the Second Amendment and American gun owners in general and blame us when the answer to this type of terrorism is more guns to protect ourselves and that's the head of Interpol two years ago.
[00:13:34.888 --> 00:13:36.469]  Two years ago.
[00:13:38.783 --> 00:13:45.405]  When there were attacks on Kenyan shopping malls and he said the answer is what Texas does, arm the citizens and you won't have hundreds killed.
[00:13:49.587 --> 00:13:50.607]  So get ready for it.
[00:13:51.968 --> 00:14:01.371]  And get ready for Obama to say our history of compassion says we've got to bring in Wahhabist Sunni invaders that have invaded Libya.
[00:14:01.991 --> 00:14:04.252]  That have invaded Egypt.
[00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:09.724]  That have invaded country after country like Syria, and been funded by our government.
[00:14:09.984 --> 00:14:12.165]  The Russians have released the satellite videos.
[00:14:14.747 --> 00:14:18.170]  And the satellite photos showing the oil being sold to Turkey, our ally.
[00:14:18.731 --> 00:14:22.393]  They've released the evidence that our government isn't really bombing ISIS and is supporting them.
[00:14:27.177 --> 00:14:32.021]  So, this happened Wednesday the 2nd, and it took them over two days to admit it was Islamic terror.
[00:14:33.322 --> 00:14:38.588]  Now we've got Liberty University president arming students, or saying students should be armed, and that's the answer.
[00:14:38.869 --> 00:14:39.209]  It is!
[00:14:39.730 --> 00:14:51.564]  Because criminals are going to march into a school, or a Army, Navy, Marine Corps recruiting center, or a military base, or a Garland, Texas,
[00:14:52.830 --> 00:14:55.011]  community center and they're going to attack.
[00:14:55.052 --> 00:15:03.477]  If they're willing to kill people in cold blood and get people on their knees and ask if they're Jewish or Christian and blow their heads off, do you think they're going to follow a gun law?
[00:15:03.717 --> 00:15:04.718]  And obviously they aren't.
[00:15:05.799 --> 00:15:12.243]  But this whole war on the Second Amendment is about the suspension of common sense and the suspension of reality.
[00:15:12.363 --> 00:15:13.204]  It is outrageous.
[00:15:13.484 --> 00:15:14.304]  We're going to go to break.
[00:15:15.585 --> 00:15:16.266]  And when we return,
[00:15:17.338 --> 00:15:29.789]  The White House, the Attorney General have all come out and said the address tonight is going to come after your guns and we're going to play a clip of Rahm Emanuel during the first campaign of Obama in 2007.
[00:15:30.089 --> 00:15:38.237]  Later to become White House Chief of Staff, later to become the Mafia Don of Chicago, the boss.
[00:15:40.194 --> 00:15:43.937]  Saying, we're gonna put you on a no-fly list, and then we're gonna put you on a no-gun-buy list.
[00:15:44.397 --> 00:15:46.138]  No judge, no jury, you can't have one.
[00:15:46.419 --> 00:15:52.923]  But people from Saudi Arabia, who pledge allegiance to ISIS, you can come here, get welfare, get a government job, we want you.
[00:15:53.324 --> 00:15:59.889]  And by the way, just so long as you find a Jew or a Christian and get them on their knees and blow their brains out all over a Christmas tree, everything's gonna be just fine.
[00:16:00.129 --> 00:16:08.195]  You see our story on that at DrudgeReport.com, how he said that they were hunting down Jews and Christians and said that Islam will rule the world.
[00:16:08.855 --> 00:16:09.635]  Alex Jones here.
[00:16:09.795 --> 00:16:26.338]  InfowarsStore.com is now partnering with the top-of-the-line storable food company, My Patriot Supply, to bring you the highest quality, freshest, longest-lasting, most affordable storable foods, private-labeled, from InfowarsSelect.com, at the lowest price you're gonna find anywhere.
[00:16:26.458 --> 00:16:28.039]  The globalists want us dependent.

[00:20:13.408 --> 00:20:17.510]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:20.991 --> 00:20:30.795]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:20:30.996 --> 00:20:36.178]  We're going to San Bernardino, California, where our reporters are on the ground.
[00:20:37.731 --> 00:20:46.694]  At the scene of an Islamic Jihad terror attack that the media tried to cover up and have now failed to cover up, another example of how their fraud is coming crashing down.
[00:20:47.854 --> 00:20:59.117]  But first, here is a clip from eight years ago, right before Obama got elected, Rahm Emanuel saying, we're going to just put you on a no-fly list because maybe we think you're a terrorist, and then you can't own a gun.
[00:20:59.157 --> 00:21:01.258]  And the larger plan is to then come confiscate them.
[00:21:01.758 --> 00:21:05.519]  Obama, the Attorney General announced on Meet the Press this morning,
[00:21:06.553 --> 00:21:07.954]  The video's on Infowars.com.
[00:21:08.914 --> 00:21:16.118]  Obama is set to announce this tonight that no judge, no jury, I have no criminal record, you have no criminal record.
[00:21:16.678 --> 00:21:18.399]  Same thing they've been doing to veterans and others.
[00:21:18.739 --> 00:21:22.501]  You just suddenly can't buy a gun and the police come to your house to confiscate them.
[00:21:22.921 --> 00:21:28.304]  They've been beta testing this in New York, Connecticut, California, and other Democratic-run cesspools.
[00:21:29.765 --> 00:21:30.985]  Let's go ahead and go to this clip.
[00:21:31.766 --> 00:21:35.888]  We've got to make this a number one issue as a test vote and then take it into the election.
[00:21:36.767 --> 00:21:46.016]  That is, if you are on the no-fly list, because you are known as maybe a possible terrorist, you cannot buy a handgun in America.
[00:21:46.036 --> 00:21:49.740]  Because we put you on the magic list, but let terrorists in.
[00:21:53.749 --> 00:22:02.295]  And I have not won far from liking the mixing of politics and policy, but as my old boss used to say, give me that vote and throw me into that fryer.
[00:22:02.335 --> 00:22:04.537]  That's Mayor Daley, the mob boss?
[00:22:04.897 --> 00:22:05.998]  That's enough from the gangster.
[00:22:06.038 --> 00:22:08.500]  The mafia that wants your guns, they can have their way with you.
[00:22:08.700 --> 00:22:11.702]  Now here's Obama just three days ago, saying the same thing.
[00:22:11.742 --> 00:22:13.764]  Well, I can't believe you're on a terror watch list.
[00:22:15.262 --> 00:22:17.623]  Anybody named John Smith is Obama, and you know it.
[00:22:17.844 --> 00:22:22.787]  Any common name, a bunch of innocent people, they admittedly throw their political enemies on the list.
[00:22:23.387 --> 00:22:26.209]  And so now, this is what they're going to announce.
[00:22:26.249 --> 00:22:31.412]  Plus, banning private sale, which is registration, and so much more.
[00:22:31.552 --> 00:22:32.332]  Get ready, folks.
[00:22:32.632 --> 00:22:33.253]  Here is the clip.
[00:22:34.212 --> 00:22:40.358]  More broadly, this tragedy reminds us of our obligation to do everything in our power together to keep our communities safe.
[00:22:40.378 --> 00:22:40.979]  To bring in ISIS?
[00:22:41.559 --> 00:22:49.126]  We know that the killers in San Bernardino used military-style assault weapons, weapons of war, to kill as many people as they could.
[00:22:49.146 --> 00:22:55.673]  It's another tragic reminder that here in America, it's way too easy for dangerous people to get their hands on a gun.
[00:22:57.142 --> 00:23:02.624]  For example, right now people on the no-fly list can walk into a store and buy a gun.
[00:23:03.744 --> 00:23:04.545]  That's insane.
[00:23:05.805 --> 00:23:10.747]  If you're too dangerous to board a plane, you're too dangerous by definition to buy a gun.
[00:23:11.067 --> 00:23:12.507]  This is how dumb he thinks the public is.
[00:23:12.527 --> 00:23:14.768]  So I'm calling on Congress to close this loophole now.
[00:23:14.828 --> 00:23:15.328]  No, let's stop.
[00:23:16.149 --> 00:23:18.089]  He means close the loophole on due process.
[00:23:19.610 --> 00:23:22.211]  Over 2 million people plus on the secret of no-fly list
[00:23:24.093 --> 00:23:25.294]  They bring in the terrorists.
[00:23:25.334 --> 00:23:26.195]  They protect them.
[00:23:26.755 --> 00:23:30.218]  It turns out she used fake names, fake addresses to get her visa.
[00:23:30.618 --> 00:23:31.179]  They didn't care.
[00:23:31.999 --> 00:23:33.280]  So they bring the people in.
[00:23:34.802 --> 00:23:39.565]  They open the southern borders up, but then, oh, we want to put you on a secret magic list.
[00:23:39.606 --> 00:23:41.727]  The loophole is due process in the courts.
[00:23:41.787 --> 00:23:42.408]  He wants to close.
[00:23:44.269 --> 00:23:50.055]  Incredible, and giving them the power to extrajudicially, key term, take your guns.
[00:23:50.435 --> 00:23:56.241]  Joining us is former Army Staff Sergeant Combat Vet of Iraq and Afghanistan, because he can speak to what's happening currently.
[00:23:56.601 --> 00:23:58.043]  They've got a big problem on their hands.
[00:23:58.103 --> 00:23:59.945]  Even NBC News, as you have reported,
[00:24:00.405 --> 00:24:07.688]  Even before it was in NBC News, it was in local news, says they got these guns from someone who got them from the police legally, and then they got them legally.
[00:24:07.908 --> 00:24:12.290]  But Obama is still blaming even the current process that we believe is true draconian.
[00:24:12.670 --> 00:24:23.015]  And then now he's set to come after the Second Amendment at an unprecedented level tonight, Joe Biggs, and then blame patriots for terrorists he literally brought in, Joe Biggs.
[00:24:24.035 --> 00:24:24.495]  Exactly.
[00:24:24.515 --> 00:24:28.637]  And also today, the father of the ISIS killer, Saeed Farooq,
[00:24:28.916 --> 00:24:43.063]  He came out and said that his son had told him that he pledged allegiance to Baghdadi and ISIS prior, and said that he had a huge problem with the Jews, he was obsessed with Israel, and that's what he believes fueled this.
[00:24:43.523 --> 00:24:47.625]  So it's something that he saw happening, no one else saw it, they all ignored it.
[00:24:47.705 --> 00:24:55.369]  Earlier today, I had an opportunity to interview three men who actually attend the exact same mosque that Saeed Farooq did.
[00:24:55.737 --> 00:24:58.120]  And that video is up at Infowars.com right now.
[00:24:58.520 --> 00:25:02.445]  Also, the name of the guy that they got the guns from is Enrique Marquez.
[00:25:02.885 --> 00:25:08.772]  He was the one who bought the two, or two of the four weapons used in Wednesday's massacre.
[00:25:09.272 --> 00:25:14.098]  Now they say that the local authorities have been trying to contact him.
[00:25:14.631 --> 00:25:21.973]  And to get an interview with him to ask him what happened and apparently he checked himself into a mental institute right after the massacre.
[00:25:22.013 --> 00:25:23.614]  Sounds like a lawyer would have pulled.
[00:25:23.874 --> 00:25:24.734]  Isn't that convenient?
[00:25:24.754 --> 00:25:26.855]  But look, the media obsesses over where they got guns.
[00:25:27.155 --> 00:25:28.275]  People are going to get guns.
[00:25:28.355 --> 00:25:30.456]  Mexico has a total gun ban, Joe, as you know.
[00:25:30.796 --> 00:25:33.777]  They have the highest crime rate in the world, over 100,000 dead in the last nine years.
[00:25:34.197 --> 00:25:37.498]  The answer is let good people have guns and then we can deal with criminals.
[00:25:38.138 --> 00:25:40.399]  And more and more police chiefs and others are saying that.
[00:25:40.419 --> 00:25:41.699]  So the common sense is getting out.
[00:25:41.719 --> 00:25:44.259]  I know you've got a lot of locals there that want to talk to us as well.
[00:25:44.279 --> 00:25:48.400]  We'll have you for several seconds, I mean for several segments, Joe Biggs.
[00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:51.801]  But first off, other things that you've noticed since you've been in San Bernardino?
[00:25:52.961 --> 00:25:57.302]  I mean, as you can see, we're standing in front of the memorial right down the street from the Inland Regional Center.
[00:25:57.582 --> 00:25:58.802]  And a lot of people have come out here.
[00:25:58.842 --> 00:26:01.183]  They're talking about what's going on, opening up dialogue.
[00:26:01.543 --> 00:26:06.404]  This is where we actually spoke to the three men who attended the mosque that Farouk also
[00:26:06.914 --> 00:26:11.995]  And like I said, there's quite a few people here that want to voice how they feel about what's going on with these attacks.
[00:26:12.455 --> 00:26:13.475]  Let's talk to some of them, Joe.
[00:26:13.955 --> 00:26:14.476]  Alright, sir.
[00:26:15.176 --> 00:26:15.876]  So what's your name, sir?
[00:26:16.276 --> 00:26:18.857]  My name is Charles Edward Alwyn.
[00:26:19.337 --> 00:26:23.477]  So what do you think about a lot of these people coming out and saying that this is due to mental illness?
[00:26:24.158 --> 00:26:25.418]  I think it's a fallacy.
[00:26:25.898 --> 00:26:27.558]  There's no mental illness going here.
[00:26:27.578 --> 00:26:34.440]  These people are programmed back in their countries.
[00:26:36.182 --> 00:26:38.443]  Uh, what do they call it when they program somebody?
[00:26:38.463 --> 00:26:39.764]  Brainwashed.
[00:26:40.364 --> 00:26:41.524]  Well, not brainwashed.
[00:26:41.925 --> 00:26:43.045]  Conditioned.
[00:26:43.905 --> 00:26:45.746]  Well, they did the same thing with Patty Hearst.
[00:26:46.046 --> 00:26:55.930]  When they grabbed her up, if anybody remembers back in the 70s, they indoctrinated them into believing how they should react and act.
[00:26:56.151 --> 00:26:57.411]  It's not a mental illness.
[00:26:57.631 --> 00:27:04.234]  We got at least 2 million people back in Saudi Arabia, back in Syria, Iraq,
[00:27:05.469 --> 00:27:07.692]  I don't think there's 2 million people with mental illness.
[00:27:07.953 --> 00:27:11.038]  They're indoctrinated to come in, infiltrate...
[00:27:12.028 --> 00:27:21.752]  The world and United States is one of their last holding places and our competent President Obama says, don't worry, we got everything under control.
[00:27:21.772 --> 00:27:24.193]  Yeah, we got everything under control.
[00:27:24.353 --> 00:27:25.473]  Tell this fellow I have a question.
[00:27:25.533 --> 00:27:28.475]  He thought it was a workplace type of... Alright, we have a question.
[00:27:28.635 --> 00:27:30.135]  What is it?
[00:27:30.215 --> 00:27:39.219]  What does this fellow think about Obama trying to get away with bringing the terrorists in and then blaming the Second Amendment for what he is an accomplice to?
[00:27:40.202 --> 00:27:49.869]  So he wants to know, why do you think that President Obama can get away with bringing these kind of people in, not vetting them, and then use that as a way to take away the Second Amendment?
[00:27:52.471 --> 00:27:56.935]  Number one, he has a backing behind him in the White House.
[00:27:57.455 --> 00:27:59.036]  He's a very slick politician.
[00:27:59.056 --> 00:28:03.580]  I think he's got a hidden agenda of what he wants for America.
[00:28:03.980 --> 00:28:08.904]  There's been all kinds of speculation on who he is, what his agenda is.
[00:28:09.751 --> 00:28:10.952]  And it's coming out.
[00:28:12.132 --> 00:28:15.755]  Putin probably looks at him as being Bozo the Clown.
[00:28:15.775 --> 00:28:25.280]  He can't pull anything off in the United States to show some courage and some determination to defend his own nation.
[00:28:25.360 --> 00:28:28.422]  Well, the president thinks that this is kind of like workplace violence.
[00:28:28.482 --> 00:28:28.902]  What is this?
[00:28:29.402 --> 00:28:30.203]  He's afraid to say it.
[00:28:32.404 --> 00:28:33.745]  He's on a different agenda.
[00:28:34.505 --> 00:28:37.567]  Workplace violence does occur.
[00:28:38.427 --> 00:28:40.466]  But when you had something like this come down...
[00:28:41.596 --> 00:28:48.877]  Our San Bernardino Police Department, our FBI came up with certain resolutions and certain evidence.
[00:28:49.137 --> 00:28:53.018]  First thing he should have said is this looks like terrorism.
[00:28:53.038 --> 00:28:53.898]  That's right, stay there.
[00:28:53.918 --> 00:28:56.439]  Good points Joe, we gotta go to break.
[00:28:57.059 --> 00:29:08.021]  We're gonna come back and talk to some more folks straight ahead, then I'm gonna go through these clips where they're announcing the draconian attack on our Second Amendment that our forebearers fought for because the leaders brought in jihadis.
[00:29:08.911 --> 00:29:15.833]  For all of recorded history, civilizations around the world praised the health benefits of silver.

[00:30:09.656 --> 00:30:17.818]  We have been fighting this war tirelessly with you at our side, day in and day out, exposing the ludicrous lies and criminal operations of the globalists.
[00:30:17.998 --> 00:30:19.999]  And we're starting to see big effects.
[00:30:20.319 --> 00:30:21.860]  And the word is getting out.
[00:30:22.220 --> 00:30:24.100]  The globalists want to make us dependent.
[00:30:24.300 --> 00:30:27.641]  And as Napoleon famously said, an army marches on its stomach.
[00:30:28.021 --> 00:30:32.963]  Ammunition, food and supplies form the backbone of any offensive, including the Info War.
[00:30:33.523 --> 00:30:36.464]  And our enemies admit they're losing the Info War.
[00:30:36.724 --> 00:30:40.289]  We are in an information war, and we are losing that war.
[00:30:40.469 --> 00:30:46.778]  With this in mind, we have held strong to our principles and the decision to refuse any money from globalists or government.

[00:31:39.347 --> 00:31:43.550]  Used since before the days of the Roman Empire to support the body's natural systems.
[00:31:43.710 --> 00:31:47.673]  Introducing the new InfoWarsLife.com Oil of Oregano formulation.
[00:31:47.873 --> 00:31:52.636]  We have now procured the most high quality and potent forms of oregano oil on the market.

[00:32:12.220 --> 00:32:21.605]  And it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and help children focus.
[00:32:21.945 --> 00:32:24.506]  All of our children are hit with modern mind control.
[00:32:24.646 --> 00:32:28.028]  Television, music, fast food, GMOs, sugars, you name it.
[00:32:28.208 --> 00:32:34.231]  Young humans have not yet developed their nervous system and are being hammered daily by globulous concoctions.
[00:32:34.531 --> 00:32:39.374]  It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down and then are put on dangerous psychotropic drugs.
[00:32:39.654 --> 00:32:45.815]  Working with my team we set out to find the best formula with the highest quality ingredients that children would actually like and take.
[00:32:46.035 --> 00:32:53.517]  We worked with the leading manufacturer in nutritional supplements that are safe for children to bring you the most affordable and powerful calming formula out there.

[00:33:12.825 --> 00:33:28.609]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:31.769 --> 00:33:36.931]  He aligns himself with the truth and it's time for you to choose a side.
[00:33:37.431 --> 00:33:39.551]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:33:47.565 --> 00:33:51.666]  Joe Biggs is on the ground with our intrepid crew.
[00:33:52.086 --> 00:34:00.328]  They were out investigating the American caliphate in Michigan and New York and other states this week when the terror attack took place in San Bernardino on Wednesday.
[00:34:01.028 --> 00:34:11.530]  Within two hours, Paul Joseph Watson had the Arabic surname, the connections to radical Islamic groups, and we believe connections to them to Facebook's pledging allegiance to ISIS.
[00:34:11.570 --> 00:34:13.191]  That was later confirmed a day later.
[00:34:14.127 --> 00:34:16.228]  Michael Savage was reporting it within two hours.
[00:34:16.308 --> 00:34:17.808]  Drudge was reporting it within a few hours.
[00:34:18.408 --> 00:34:21.789]  But the rest of the controlled media was not talking about it.
[00:34:24.310 --> 00:34:27.930]  And within the first three or four hours, they were blaming conservatives, veterans, and gun owners.
[00:34:29.171 --> 00:34:33.792]  In fact, they were blaming me, because I'd had Donald Trump on that day.
[00:34:34.966 --> 00:34:35.346]  Wednesday.
[00:34:35.747 --> 00:34:43.492]  We've been talking about radical Islamists being brought into the country and how he'd been correct about celebrating 9-11 and other events, including the Paris attacks.
[00:34:44.892 --> 00:34:51.517]  And they were saying in the media and a bunch of publications that, oh look, Donald Trump and Alex Jones listeners have killed people with no proof.
[00:34:55.103 --> 00:34:59.885]  Then they went on at the White House run Media Matters to say that we said it didn't even happen or was fake.
[00:35:00.345 --> 00:35:05.108]  No, we said it's a false flag in that they opened the borders up and brought the people in to begin with.
[00:35:06.328 --> 00:35:07.409]  And here's the big issue.
[00:35:09.189 --> 00:35:10.990]  What is the political mathematics?
[00:35:11.050 --> 00:35:14.852]  What is the political calculus to believe they can get away with the optics?
[00:35:15.552 --> 00:35:16.413]  Or the way this looks?
[00:35:18.213 --> 00:35:21.615]  In France, in Germany, here in the United States and other places.
[00:35:21.655 --> 00:35:23.536]  Well, we know what the calculus is.
[00:35:24.656 --> 00:35:25.937]  What they do in Europe is what they do here.
[00:35:26.417 --> 00:35:29.400]  They have banned free speech in Germany and France against the open borders.
[00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:35.404]  They are arresting frontrunners in presidential elections for criticizing open borders like Marie Le Pen.
[00:35:37.586 --> 00:35:38.947]  Europe has fallen to total tyranny.
[00:35:39.247 --> 00:35:51.216]  The socialists and the big government types are so wedded to their totalitarianism and how sexy they think radical jihad is, that major feminist groups, liberals, socialists, you name it, are backing this.
[00:35:52.148 --> 00:35:55.070]  These are sick, self-hating freaks.
[00:35:57.552 --> 00:36:03.057]  Meanwhile, we have chilling messages from menacing migrants demanding open borders with Macedonia at checkpoint.
[00:36:03.197 --> 00:36:04.878]  Open your border or die.
[00:36:07.180 --> 00:36:09.462]  And here are some of the headlines at Infowars.com.
[00:36:09.622 --> 00:36:13.305]  Liberals now openly admit we must destroy the Second Amendment, close quote.
[00:36:14.366 --> 00:36:16.748]  And then we have links to all these statements and admissions.
[00:36:17.708 --> 00:36:19.170]  This is a Louder with Crowder article.
[00:36:20.270 --> 00:36:22.512]  Where they admit, yes, we're going to take your guns.
[00:36:24.694 --> 00:36:29.319]  And then we've got NBC News, CNN and others saying, well, there was a Christmas tree.
[00:36:29.899 --> 00:36:31.120]  Maybe that's the fault.
[00:36:31.781 --> 00:36:35.124]  There were some big mouth Christians, too, that were, you know, being uppity.
[00:36:35.785 --> 00:36:36.625]  This will teach them.
[00:36:37.787 --> 00:36:41.230]  There is such a hatred of Christians and libertarians and veterans that
[00:36:42.574 --> 00:36:47.695]  The weird, fanatical left will do anything to basically see that we're exterminated.
[00:36:48.115 --> 00:36:49.475]  And these aren't real liberals.
[00:36:49.715 --> 00:36:51.256]  Again, Thomas Jefferson was a liberal.
[00:36:52.256 --> 00:36:53.016]  I'm a libertarian.
[00:36:53.736 --> 00:36:56.397]  I'm for freedom and open expression and tolerance.
[00:36:56.777 --> 00:36:57.877]  You people are intolerant.
[00:36:58.457 --> 00:37:04.918]  Scores of universities are banning Christmas and banning Christmas trees and saying the colors red and green or red and white are racist.
[00:37:05.699 --> 00:37:07.419]  I can't even believe how crazy this has gotten.
[00:37:08.679 --> 00:37:10.180]  But this is a cult takeover.
[00:37:10.900 --> 00:37:12.220]  The God has to be the state.
[00:37:13.737 --> 00:37:19.848]  And any outside group that's the enemy of their enemy is the New World Order's friend, to quote an old Arabic saying.
[00:37:22.298 --> 00:37:26.239]  Let's go back to Joe Biggs, we'll do this segment the next and into the next hour, then I'm going to open the phones up.
[00:37:26.279 --> 00:37:30.560]  Joe, I want to get your take on this big speech he's going to be giving tonight.
[00:37:30.880 --> 00:37:38.203]  I'll be doing a live Facebook mentions at 7, while he's giving his address, analyzing it, at InfoWars.com and on our major Facebook.
[00:37:38.563 --> 00:37:42.724]  We get sometimes millions of viewers for these mentions that we do, on average about 300,000.
[00:37:42.904 --> 00:37:47.165]  But that's coming up at 7 o'clock tonight, Central, about an hour after this broadcast ends.
[00:37:47.185 --> 00:37:49.626]  But I want to talk to some more of those locals first.
[00:37:50.226 --> 00:38:01.851]  Joe, I mean, I can't even believe that our government is run by such evil people that they would bring in a giant jihad army and there's no doubt Europe and the United States are going to face massive sleeper cell attacks.
[00:38:02.331 --> 00:38:11.415]  How does the political class think they'll scapegoat the Second Amendment and veterans and conservatives and take our guns while petting and loving and aiding and abetting the jihadis?
[00:38:11.735 --> 00:38:13.296]  How will this filth get away with this?
[00:38:14.776 --> 00:38:15.597]  I mean, it's ridiculous.
[00:38:15.637 --> 00:38:18.438]  I mean, even on social media, right after the attack took place,
[00:38:18.817 --> 00:38:24.118]  People are releasing the identity of the man who perpetrated it all, Saeed Farooq.
[00:38:24.618 --> 00:38:32.040]  But the government, the White House, was so scared because of political correctness that they couldn't even come out until later to do it.
[00:38:32.380 --> 00:38:33.660]  I mean, by then it was all over.
[00:38:33.701 --> 00:38:37.641]  So that's why our government is so scared of political correctness.
[00:38:37.681 --> 00:38:45.983]  They just want to prance around everything and try to please everybody and be nice instead of doing what they have to do, calling things what they are.
[00:38:46.003 --> 00:38:48.324]  You know, tonight's going to be a monumental
[00:38:48.792 --> 00:39:00.200]  Time in history, because this is only the third time that President Obama has even addressed, or this will be the fourth time that President Obama has addressed the nation during primetime television at the Oval Office.
[00:39:00.620 --> 00:39:06.404]  I mean, and he's going to use this attack here in San Bernardino to start pushing that anti-gun stuff like he always does.
[00:39:06.684 --> 00:39:10.107]  The same thing he did at the Umpqua Community College in Oregon when we were there.
[00:39:10.727 --> 00:39:16.191]  Instead of going in, worrying about the victims, talking about radical Islam, talking about the terrorist attacks,
[00:39:16.519 --> 00:39:20.461]  Instead, he's talking about and addressing the country about stricter gun control.
[00:39:20.841 --> 00:39:25.884]  He's so arrogant, and Joe, everybody knows that I'm not a, quote, Islamophobe.
[00:39:25.944 --> 00:39:29.126]  I didn't buy into all the fear-mongering, but maybe it wasn't fear-mongering.
[00:39:29.866 --> 00:39:33.908]  All I know is, we've got a president that wears a Wahhabist Islamic ring.
[00:39:34.589 --> 00:39:36.750]  Not just a Muslim ring, but a radical Muslim ring.
[00:39:37.510 --> 00:39:39.291]  His name is Barack Hussein Obama.
[00:39:39.591 --> 00:39:41.372]  He went to madrasas in Indonesia.
[00:39:41.652 --> 00:39:44.434]  He can speak Arabic better than most Muslims, on record.
[00:39:45.534 --> 00:39:50.035]  He apologized, you know, in Egypt in his first big speech as president for America.
[00:39:50.055 --> 00:39:53.136]  And I tell you, this is looking more and more like a double cross.
[00:39:53.216 --> 00:39:57.477]  I mean, I don't know how he'll get away with this, but maybe he will.
[00:39:57.497 --> 00:39:59.538]  I mean, how far will this go?
[00:39:59.558 --> 00:40:02.098]  I mean, you have Hillary Clinton.
[00:40:02.158 --> 00:40:05.319]  You've got all these people coming out and pushing for stricter gun control.
[00:40:05.599 --> 00:40:07.980]  Strict gun control didn't work in this instance.
[00:40:08.080 --> 00:40:08.720]  It hasn't worked.
[00:40:09.247 --> 00:40:10.868]  In Chicago, with all the stuff.
[00:40:11.088 --> 00:40:12.650]  It hasn't worked in New York.
[00:40:13.150 --> 00:40:14.651]  Strict gun control does not work.
[00:40:14.691 --> 00:40:17.193]  But it has let the government get more power, though, and take more liberties.
[00:40:17.213 --> 00:40:19.114]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:40:19.154 --> 00:40:20.676]  That's exactly what they want.
[00:40:20.696 --> 00:40:22.557]  That's why they allow this kind of stuff to happen.
[00:40:22.897 --> 00:40:24.879]  And it's just completely and totally ridiculous.
[00:40:25.219 --> 00:40:32.925]  Instead of putting our focus on talking about radical Islam and how we can defeat ISIS, we're too worried about political correctness.
[00:40:32.945 --> 00:40:36.867]  And I was gonna actually go to, uh, back to this gentleman right here real quick.
[00:40:36.907 --> 00:40:37.328]  Let's do it.
[00:40:38.109 --> 00:40:40.810]  What did you want to go ahead and say about what's happened?
[00:40:41.071 --> 00:40:42.271]  What do you think about everything overall?
[00:40:43.632 --> 00:40:44.092]  Okay.
[00:40:44.312 --> 00:40:53.617]  Bottom line is, I think, uh, Obama, President Obama is just, uh, had his agenda.
[00:40:53.977 --> 00:40:55.298]  He wants gun control.
[00:40:55.318 --> 00:40:59.920]  He feels that gun control will solve all of our problems.
[00:41:00.843 --> 00:41:03.264]  They will not solve all of our problems.
[00:41:03.424 --> 00:41:06.645]  Number one, in our Constitution, we have the right to bear arms.
[00:41:06.665 --> 00:41:20.130]  What we need to do is to get these laws into effect, to take these people that use these guns, or before they use these guns, to get some type of practical laws enforced for them not to use them.
[00:41:20.410 --> 00:41:26.913]  As far as mental illness goes, there's going to be a very, in my opinion, a very small percentage
[00:41:27.698 --> 00:41:30.260]  Uh, the people that, uh... Okay, tell them thank you.
[00:41:31.220 --> 00:41:33.141]  Look, there isn't a big gun problem.
[00:41:33.682 --> 00:41:35.283]  Overall gun violence is way down.
[00:41:35.523 --> 00:41:37.464]  They're hyping these things up like it's the end of the world.
[00:41:37.704 --> 00:41:41.006]  What is going to be big is jihad attacks are happening every week now.
[00:41:41.026 --> 00:41:44.268]  There were three or four more in England and Europe, Joe.
[00:41:44.748 --> 00:41:46.409]  I mean, how are they going to cover all these up?
[00:41:46.510 --> 00:41:55.515]  What are the Democrats going to do when their little baby migrants, by the hundreds of thousands and millions, uh, you know, large percentages of them start murdering everybody?
[00:41:55.835 --> 00:41:56.696]  What are they going to do?
[00:41:57.276 --> 00:41:59.377]  Will they suspend logic and come take my guns?
[00:41:59.417 --> 00:42:00.438]  Well, it's not going to happen, Joe.
[00:42:00.478 --> 00:42:01.118]  I'm sick of it.
[00:42:02.479 --> 00:42:02.979]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:42:02.999 --> 00:42:13.804]  I mean, like you said, we've got these sheriffs all over the country who are going out, posting Facebook messages, telling the public, hey, if you have that concealed weapons permit, go out, carry, exercise that right.
[00:42:14.124 --> 00:42:14.924]  Don't be afraid.
[00:42:15.405 --> 00:42:20.067]  People need those extra set of eyes and someone that can help deter or stop something like this from happening.
[00:42:20.809 --> 00:42:21.330]  Absolutely.
[00:42:21.370 --> 00:42:24.232]  It's insane to blame gun owners for what's happening.
[00:42:24.252 --> 00:42:29.036]  Joe, I want to come back in the next segment and go down the line and just tell folks, hey, we're about to go live.
[00:42:29.076 --> 00:42:30.277]  Give each person about a minute.
[00:42:30.597 --> 00:42:32.118]  I want to get people's, you know, take on it.
[00:42:32.139 --> 00:42:33.380]  I don't care if they agree, disagree.
[00:42:33.780 --> 00:42:35.761]  I want to talk to a bunch of those folks that are out there.
[00:42:36.162 --> 00:42:42.607]  They have got the site of the shooting or the site where the shooters lived is blocked off to regular media.
[00:42:42.827 --> 00:42:46.590]  But if you're corporate MSNBC or CNN, you're allowed to go in the crime scene.
[00:42:47.251 --> 00:42:49.012]  So Joe is way back.
[00:42:50.092 --> 00:42:52.695]  Uh, from, uh, where the killers actually lived.
[00:42:53.076 --> 00:42:57.081]  We're analyzing this because this is the triumph of brainwashing we're seeing.
[00:42:57.641 --> 00:43:07.834]  Where the government brings in the jihadis, protects them, the neighbors won't report them because of political correctness, they pledge allegiance to ISIS, one of them's from Saudi Arabia, and nothing can be done.
[00:43:08.931 --> 00:43:11.992]  Monsanto going to trial for crimes against humanity.
[00:43:12.212 --> 00:43:18.475]  That's right, one of the most hated companies in the world will have to answer for its reign of toxic ecological terror.
[00:43:18.755 --> 00:43:28.118]  Several activist groups joined by food and farming experts are suing Monsanto, but the way they plan on having Monsanto answer for their crimes may surprise you and may be cause for concern.
[00:43:28.338 --> 00:43:30.139]  The International Court in The Hague, Netherlands
[00:43:30.299 --> 00:43:30.899]  We're good to go.
[00:43:46.067 --> 00:43:46.748]  We're good to go.
[00:44:05.245 --> 00:44:08.166]  Rob Dew reporting for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:44:08.907 --> 00:44:18.150]  InfoWars Life and InfoWarsLife.com is extremely excited to announce our latest release, Winter Sun, a revolutionary type of vitamin D3.
[00:44:18.390 --> 00:44:22.992]  Winter Sun is a premium quality vitamin D3 nutritional supplement.
[00:44:23.072 --> 00:44:24.593]  It is produced by extracting oil.
[00:44:24.753 --> 00:44:24.953]  I think?
[00:44:44.457 --> 00:44:49.441]  As verified by Independent Laboratories, is the best vegan vitamin D3 product in the world.
[00:44:49.821 --> 00:44:54.565]  Read the facts at Infowarslife.com about Winter Sun vitamin D3.
[00:44:54.845 --> 00:45:00.470]  Not only does vitamin D3 promote a healthy mood, but vitamin D supports our memory and brain function.
[00:45:00.790 --> 00:45:02.571]  Something the globalists are targeting.
[00:45:02.912 --> 00:45:05.554]  Visit Infowars.com today or call 888-253-3139.
[00:45:12.863 --> 00:45:22.265]  And it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and help children focus.
[00:45:22.585 --> 00:45:25.125]  All of our children are hit with modern mind control.
[00:45:25.305 --> 00:45:28.646]  Television, music, fast food, GMOs, sugars, you name it.
[00:45:28.866 --> 00:45:34.867]  Young humans have not yet developed their nervous system and are being hammered daily by globulous concoctions.
[00:45:35.167 --> 00:45:39.548]  It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down and then are put on dangerous psychotropic
[00:45:39.608 --> 00:45:40.028]  I think so.
[00:46:09.501 --> 00:46:12.483]  A clean, toxic-free body is the foundation of true health.
[00:46:12.704 --> 00:46:14.865]  Deep Cleanze by InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:46:15.065 --> 00:46:21.770]  A scientifically formulated blend of nanocolloidal zeolites and organic ingredients that aid the body in cleansing chemicals and toxic metals.
[00:46:22.070 --> 00:46:27.234]  Using our proprietary multi-step extraction technology, Deep Cleanze is our most affordable all-in-one cleanser.
[00:46:27.394 --> 00:46:36.421]  With concentrated organic compounds like cilantro, milk thistle, fulvic acid, orange peel, zeolites, and others, Deep Cleanze doesn't hold back.
[00:46:36.801 --> 00:46:45.426]  Instead of buying five, six, or even seven different cleansing products, we use decades-old scientific research to put together the Rolls-Royce of all-in-one cleansing.
[00:46:45.686 --> 00:46:52.611]  Look, there's a reason Deep Cleanse is the only product on the market that uses our proprietary Spike G-Rex herbal processing technique.
[00:46:52.771 --> 00:46:58.174]  We use only the highest quality organic herbs, backed by serious research, and we still bring it to you with the best.
[00:46:58.434 --> 00:47:00.595]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:47:26.232 --> 00:47:31.198]  He aligns himself with the truth and it's time for you to choose a side.
[00:47:31.558 --> 00:47:33.860]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:47:43.070 --> 00:47:51.438]  ...city health department building area where the massacre was conducted by two operatives, two lone wolf assassins of ISIS.
[00:47:51.458 --> 00:47:52.459]  They've taken credit for it.
[00:47:52.479 --> 00:47:53.700]  They pledged allegiance to ISIS.
[00:47:54.260 --> 00:47:56.042]  ISIS has said that they were basically their minions.
[00:47:56.843 --> 00:48:04.069]  They've had the Islamic leaders out of Saudi Arabia call for soft kill and other asymmetrical warfare attacks.
[00:48:05.170 --> 00:48:08.372]  with automatic weapons across the US and Europe in the last few months.
[00:48:08.872 --> 00:48:09.853]  That is now happening.
[00:48:10.353 --> 00:48:16.137]  Turkey is now threatening to blow up Russian ships in the Mediterranean because they dare fight ISIS.
[00:48:16.917 --> 00:48:17.838]  That is escalating.
[00:48:17.878 --> 00:48:19.739]  It's all coming up in the second hour.
[00:48:20.359 --> 00:48:28.204]  Now before I go any further, Facebook Mentions is a function that a few hundred people with big Facebook accounts have.
[00:48:29.564 --> 00:48:32.246]  And normally when I do it, we reach about 200-300,000 people, which is still big.
[00:48:34.929 --> 00:48:35.949]  And I do it maybe once a week.
[00:48:37.510 --> 00:48:41.752]  Now, I've had a few since I've done this the last few months that have gotten 500,000, 700,000 views.
[00:48:42.312 --> 00:48:48.434]  Now, most of the videos I do get around 900,000 to a million views.
[00:48:49.135 --> 00:48:52.656]  And let me just give you an example right now if you're a TV viewer.
[00:48:52.676 --> 00:48:55.657]  If you're a radio listener, InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[00:48:56.237 --> 00:48:58.498]  And this just shows how upset people are about this.
[00:48:59.098 --> 00:49:02.940]  I shot this three hours ago, outside with my cousin.
[00:49:04.833 --> 00:49:06.295]  We had the kids out at the park.
[00:49:07.076 --> 00:49:07.757]  Emergency!
[00:49:07.938 --> 00:49:12.745]  Obama to announce massive gun control push in speech tonight.
[00:49:12.765 --> 00:49:13.426]  210,000 views.
[00:49:15.939 --> 00:49:16.599]  In a couple hours.
[00:49:16.619 --> 00:49:17.840]  I mean, that'll be a million by tomorrow.
[00:49:18.320 --> 00:49:18.821]  Look at this one.
[00:49:19.081 --> 00:49:19.881]  Shot this Friday.
[00:49:20.261 --> 00:49:23.143]  Islamic terror cells now active.
[00:49:23.163 --> 00:49:23.983]  994,000 views.
[00:49:24.944 --> 00:49:26.785]  Obama has a Facebook mentions.
[00:49:26.805 --> 00:49:27.785]  The White House does.
[00:49:28.266 --> 00:49:29.446]  And they have a YouTube channel.
[00:49:29.807 --> 00:49:32.288]  His average video now gets about 10,000 views.
[00:49:32.628 --> 00:49:33.429]  The President gets 10,000 views.
[00:49:33.449 --> 00:49:33.869]  I get 994,000 views.
[00:49:33.929 --> 00:49:35.650]  And we're on over 170 AM and FM affiliates.
[00:49:41.977 --> 00:49:43.859]  We have billions of views on YouTube.
[00:49:43.999 --> 00:49:44.839]  I'm not bragging.
[00:49:44.919 --> 00:49:46.941]  I'm just saying, what a paper tiger.
[00:49:48.382 --> 00:49:50.744]  CNN's average show has 300,000 viewers.
[00:49:51.505 --> 00:49:53.766]  But they sit up there and lecture like they control reality.
[00:49:54.047 --> 00:49:55.408]  Same thing with MSNBC.
[00:49:55.708 --> 00:49:56.589]  They're a joke.
[00:49:59.070 --> 00:50:05.876]  Our YouTube channel has six... Let's go show folks.
[00:50:05.896 --> 00:50:07.177]  1,178,000 subscribers.
[00:50:07.297 --> 00:50:08.518]  One of dozens of channels.
[00:50:08.558 --> 00:50:09.919]  But click about for folks.
[00:50:10.419 --> 00:50:10.940]  Click about.
[00:50:12.213 --> 00:50:13.896]  And then let's show people how many views we have.
[00:50:15.057 --> 00:50:16.199]  600 plus million.
[00:50:19.744 --> 00:50:20.766]  Well, it's way more than that.
[00:50:23.330 --> 00:50:24.772]  So, go ahead and see that for yourself.
[00:50:24.792 --> 00:50:25.573]  That's just one channel.
[00:50:25.934 --> 00:50:27.756]  That's what they can't stand.
[00:50:29.465 --> 00:50:32.728]  We've got multiple billions of views on YouTube, all channels combined.
[00:50:33.008 --> 00:50:33.568]  They hate us.
[00:50:34.289 --> 00:50:44.017]  But they sit up there with that last illusion, with bigger and bigger sets, with more and more political operatives up there, with almost no viewers, lying to you, saying this wasn't jihad terror.
[00:50:44.378 --> 00:50:48.121]  Now this segment, the next, and the next, I'm talking to folks in San Bernardino, California.
[00:50:50.779 --> 00:50:58.322]  We are going to open the phones up for the balance of transmission and announce the winner of a Facebook meme contest where they're trying to ban Christmas.
[00:50:58.722 --> 00:51:03.304]  We have a winner and a $1,000 prize will be announced in the final segment coming up today.

[00:51:21.555 --> 00:51:23.857]  And your purchase funds this operation.

[00:51:28.782 --> 00:51:30.444]  $9.95 colloidal silver ends tonight.

[00:52:03.185 --> 00:52:08.187]  There will be some more specials this week, but these specials are gone forever, starting tonight at midnight.
[00:52:08.267 --> 00:52:09.567]  InfowarsStore.com.
[00:52:09.907 --> 00:52:12.348]  Okay, Joe, I'm gonna get to everybody now.
[00:52:12.388 --> 00:52:14.009]  The toll-free number for folks to join us is 877-789-2539.
[00:52:14.029 --> 00:52:15.089]  First-time callers, 877-789-2539.
[00:52:15.109 --> 00:52:15.469]  Now, I want
[00:52:22.472 --> 00:52:24.198]  To go to all these people that are lining up to talk to you.
[00:52:24.218 --> 00:52:24.740]  Tell them we will.
[00:52:25.161 --> 00:52:27.951]  But first I've got to ask you, because the calculus just doesn't fit.
[00:52:28.755 --> 00:52:30.435]  And I study this stuff hardcore as you do.
[00:52:31.256 --> 00:52:43.078]  How do they bring in hundreds of thousands of jihadis here, potential jihadis, millions in Europe, let them attack us, and then say it's our fault, we gotta turn our guns in, or ban free speech and declare martial law in Europe, and arrest conservatives?
[00:52:43.658 --> 00:52:46.699]  How are they gonna get away with this, or will they, Joe?
[00:52:47.019 --> 00:52:48.359]  What's the master plan here?
[00:52:48.619 --> 00:52:49.379]  Because it's clear.
[00:52:49.839 --> 00:52:52.520]  We had five more attacks in Europe this weekend.
[00:52:53.340 --> 00:52:56.662]  I mean, this is a machete attack in London screaming Allah Akbar.
[00:52:56.962 --> 00:52:59.844]  How are they going to get this over on us, Joe Biggs?
[00:53:00.744 --> 00:53:02.005]  They are getting that over on us.
[00:53:02.045 --> 00:53:04.446]  They are getting away with it, as we speak right now.
[00:53:05.027 --> 00:53:09.089]  This stuff continues to happen at alarming rates all across the world.
[00:53:10.089 --> 00:53:19.495]  And yet, he tries to switch the focus from the real issues with the radical Islam and the fact that that is something that exists.
[00:53:19.775 --> 00:53:20.895]  He's too scared to mention it.
[00:53:20.935 --> 00:53:22.156]  He's too scared to talk about it.
[00:53:23.291 --> 00:53:25.952]  And he's too worried about his political correctness all the time.
[00:53:26.032 --> 00:53:27.512]  But sometimes, you're a president.
[00:53:27.833 --> 00:53:30.453]  You've got to... Well, it's beyond that, John, mind you.
[00:53:30.613 --> 00:53:35.775]  He wants the threat to build to be so big, when it busts out, then they'll take our liberties to counter it, as you concurred.
[00:53:36.475 --> 00:53:38.236]  There's something even bigger to this, but I agree with you.
[00:53:38.256 --> 00:53:39.316]  Let's talk to some of these folks.
[00:53:40.337 --> 00:53:40.577]  All right.
[00:53:41.037 --> 00:53:41.657]  What's your name, sir?
[00:53:41.917 --> 00:53:42.638]  Richard Noble.
[00:53:42.978 --> 00:53:44.498]  And who are you out here representing?
[00:53:45.238 --> 00:53:46.339]  The LGBT community.
[00:53:46.719 --> 00:53:47.259]  Gay community.
[00:53:47.919 --> 00:53:50.880]  And so, why are you out here?
[00:53:50.920 --> 00:53:52.721]  What are you wanting to talk about?
[00:53:53.593 --> 00:54:00.877]  Well, first of all, my heartfelt prayers and condolences go out to all the families and loved ones of the people that we've lost and those who are recovering in the hospital.
[00:54:01.557 --> 00:54:03.538]  Second, I want more intelligence gathering.
[00:54:03.618 --> 00:54:12.282]  I just saw a photograph of an ISIL member throwing two gay men off of a rooftop in Syria because they were gay, and I want intelligence gathering missions.
[00:54:12.362 --> 00:54:14.783]  I want these people identified, and I want missile strikes.
[00:54:15.163 --> 00:54:16.164]  I want these people dead.
[00:54:16.304 --> 00:54:18.085]  Well, you don't think you should be tolerant of that?
[00:54:18.550 --> 00:54:19.330]  Tolerant of murder?
[00:54:19.470 --> 00:54:19.690]  No.
[00:54:19.850 --> 00:54:24.412]  Well, I mean, there's a lot of people on the left that think that we should be tolerant of everything, that we should be tolerant of all stuff.
[00:54:24.612 --> 00:54:25.152]  I vote left.
[00:54:25.212 --> 00:54:25.932]  I am far left.
[00:54:25.972 --> 00:54:26.773]  I voted for Obama.
[00:54:26.833 --> 00:54:27.493]  I want tougher.
[00:54:27.553 --> 00:54:28.313]  I want to be tougher.
[00:54:28.693 --> 00:54:32.534]  I want people to go on missions and operations on the ground and take these people out.
[00:54:32.874 --> 00:54:34.615]  I can't deal with this crap anymore.
[00:54:35.395 --> 00:54:38.876]  Ask why Europe and the left are bringing all these people in.
[00:54:39.036 --> 00:54:47.539]  I may be controversial on this issue, but I think if we have weapons of mass destruction and we're selling them and they're just rampant in our communities, that there need to be safe,
[00:54:48.206 --> 00:54:48.666]  I think so.
[00:54:58.846 --> 00:55:01.667]  Check them in and when you want to go do some recreation, check them out.
[00:55:01.727 --> 00:55:03.887]  Give your intention for using them and check them back in.
[00:55:03.907 --> 00:55:07.048]  See, Obama brought the jihadis in, so this guy would call for this.
[00:55:07.188 --> 00:55:09.389]  Who's the NRA, you know, who are we kidding here?
[00:55:09.629 --> 00:55:13.890]  So, so you think that we should have basically like a, an armory system set up.
[00:55:14.010 --> 00:55:14.290]  Absolutely.
[00:55:14.310 --> 00:55:14.850]  This guy has no clue.
[00:55:14.870 --> 00:55:17.210]  And every day people should have to check their weapons.
[00:55:17.230 --> 00:55:19.311]  Asking why Obama brought the jihadis in.
[00:55:19.391 --> 00:55:20.871]  I think that we have a right to have handguns.
[00:55:20.891 --> 00:55:22.352]  Well, I mean, anything assaults a verb.
[00:55:22.372 --> 00:55:27.113]  So, I mean, I could take a, a minuscule rifle and then I can basically assault something.
[00:55:27.313 --> 00:55:28.193]  So is that assault rifle?
[00:55:29.162 --> 00:55:29.663]  Um, yes.
[00:55:30.344 --> 00:55:33.288]  Asking why the left is bringing in the jihadis.
[00:55:33.368 --> 00:55:34.950]  I'm saying check them into an armory.
[00:55:35.390 --> 00:55:37.473]  When you want to use them, you want to go deer hunting.
[00:55:37.633 --> 00:55:39.576]  See if you want to know the calculus, this is it.
[00:55:39.596 --> 00:55:40.437]  This is the situation.
[00:55:40.457 --> 00:55:42.800]  What happens when a situation like this though happens?
[00:55:43.160 --> 00:55:45.423]  The whole point of the Second Amendment is to be able to protect yourself.
[00:55:45.700 --> 00:55:46.581]  From crazy people.
[00:55:46.801 --> 00:55:51.985]  You know, so when you take the guns from the law-abiding citizens, then the crazy people still get it.
[00:55:52.145 --> 00:55:54.026]  Asking why Obama brought the jihadis in.
[00:55:54.046 --> 00:55:56.468]  These high-powered assault weapons that we're seeing.
[00:55:56.488 --> 00:55:58.309]  What do you consider a high-powered assault weapon?
[00:55:58.329 --> 00:55:58.570]  It was a .223.
[00:55:58.690 --> 00:56:03.173]  Isn't that an assault rifle?
[00:56:03.393 --> 00:56:04.534]  Let's not argue that stuff.
[00:56:04.654 --> 00:56:05.254]  Ask him this.
[00:56:05.955 --> 00:56:09.037]  Why does he think governments are bringing these jihadis in?
[00:56:09.217 --> 00:56:11.319]  So there's a crisis and they can take our guns?
[00:56:11.339 --> 00:56:14.041]  Why do you think President Obama is allowing these people to come into the country?
[00:56:15.663 --> 00:56:19.948]  Well, I mean, you mean allowing people from around the world to come into our country?
[00:56:19.968 --> 00:56:20.749]  Yeah, the jihadists.
[00:56:21.129 --> 00:56:26.996]  The jihadis, the Syrian refugees, not saying they're the same, but you know that they're using that as an escape route.
[00:56:27.403 --> 00:56:31.165]  To hide in there and exploit that and come over and do stuff, carry out attacks.
[00:56:31.265 --> 00:56:32.165]  Hide and where?
[00:56:32.265 --> 00:56:33.066]  Amongst the refugees.
[00:56:33.086 --> 00:56:33.806]  Amongst the refugees.
[00:56:34.367 --> 00:56:41.470]  That needs to be, yeah, I don't know why he... So, do you think we should just leave the borders open, or do you think we should have a stricter vetting process and find out?
[00:56:41.530 --> 00:56:43.491]  I definitely think we need a stricter vetting process.
[00:56:44.071 --> 00:56:44.992]  That's my personal opinion.
[00:56:45.032 --> 00:56:46.313]  There you go, so he's got half a brain.
[00:56:46.393 --> 00:56:49.794]  So, I may be liberal, but I'm conservative on a lot of issues.
[00:56:49.834 --> 00:56:50.535]  Well, tell him thanks.
[00:56:50.555 --> 00:56:51.655]  Let's talk to the next person, Joe.
[00:56:51.755 --> 00:56:54.777]  Alright, let me get, uh, who else wants to talk?
[00:56:56.348 --> 00:56:57.208]  A whole lot of folks.
[00:56:57.228 --> 00:56:58.289]  Go ahead, tell me about a minute.
[00:56:58.329 --> 00:56:58.729]  What's your name?
[00:56:59.049 --> 00:56:59.289]  Brad.
[00:56:59.809 --> 00:57:01.630]  Brad, so are you a resident from here?
[00:57:02.090 --> 00:57:02.811]  I live in Redlands.
[00:57:03.131 --> 00:57:03.871]  Alright, what's his views?
[00:57:04.471 --> 00:57:05.092]  So what are your views on this?
[00:57:05.112 --> 00:57:06.052]  What do you think about this whole thing?
[00:57:06.472 --> 00:57:10.994]  Well, I think we've become extremely weak because of the NSA policies that are in place.
[00:57:11.574 --> 00:57:17.637]  We're surveilling way too many Americans right now, and we could be focusing those efforts on certain individuals instead.
[00:57:18.277 --> 00:57:20.618]  I think that's actually Rand Paul's view.
[00:57:20.638 --> 00:57:21.999]  I think he kind of hits the nail on the head.
[00:57:23.110 --> 00:57:29.738]  So instead of them spying on us in New York for investigating Islamberg, they should actually be watching the people who are going to go out and carry out the attacks.
[00:57:30.299 --> 00:57:31.180]  Because we know they're watching.
[00:57:31.340 --> 00:57:31.520]  Yeah.
[00:57:31.741 --> 00:57:33.142]  How's something like that slipping through the cracks?
[00:57:33.283 --> 00:57:33.863]  That's what I want to know.
[00:57:34.304 --> 00:57:35.105]  Tell him to stay there.
[00:57:35.305 --> 00:57:36.106]  We're back in 70 seconds.
[00:57:36.206 --> 00:57:40.812]  I want to find out more from him why he thinks that they're letting it slip through.
[00:57:41.252 --> 00:57:41.933]  Because they know
[00:57:43.007 --> 00:57:47.895]  Their constituents are like the last guy that says, take the guns away because the Islamists are going to kill us.
[00:57:48.236 --> 00:57:49.378]  Well, who brought them in?
[00:57:49.398 --> 00:57:52.523]  This is an invasion force that invaded Syria.
[00:57:52.723 --> 00:57:53.905]  That's who the refugees are.
[00:57:54.146 --> 00:57:56.229]  They're the Wahhabi and Shihadi invaders!
[00:57:58.832 --> 00:58:01.793]  A clean, toxic-free body is the foundation of true health.

[00:58:59.781 --> 00:59:13.931]  My fellow patriots, one of the things I'm most proud of is the fact that the InfoWars operation reaches more than 20 million people a week worldwide with the message of liberty, and none of it is funded by major global corporations or by taxpayers.
[00:59:14.371 --> 00:59:15.932]  It's funded by free will.

[00:59:56.759 --> 00:59:59.181]  InfoWars is the operation that you built.
[01:00:03.363 --> 01:00:07.866]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:12.548 --> 01:00:18.572]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:00:19.172 --> 01:00:22.154]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:36.078 --> 01:00:39.199]  Alright, we are talking to folks on the ground in San Bernardino, California.
[01:00:39.239 --> 01:00:40.219]  All we need is their first name.
[01:00:40.239 --> 01:00:41.260]  We're talking to Brad.
[01:00:41.720 --> 01:00:47.321]  He's out there in front of the health department where 14 were massacred in a jihad attack that the corporate media tried to cover up.
[01:00:47.422 --> 01:00:51.723]  And the big issue here is the corporate media wasn't able to cover it up anymore.
[01:00:51.743 --> 01:00:55.844]  Why do you think Donald Trump came on this show knowing he'd be demonized for coming on?
[01:00:57.525 --> 01:01:05.147]  Because his advisors said it's good to be demonized by enemy media, by collaborator media, by discredited whore media.
[01:01:06.762 --> 01:01:11.104]  I mean, I fall out of bed and do a YouTube video and it gets a million views.
[01:01:11.624 --> 01:01:13.165]  You political honchos can't get 5,000.
[01:01:13.485 --> 01:01:15.766]  The president can't do that anymore.
[01:01:16.126 --> 01:01:17.247]  You're a joke.
[01:01:17.567 --> 01:01:18.907]  People are sick of you.
[01:01:19.467 --> 01:01:20.708]  But you're arrogant though.
[01:01:21.028 --> 01:01:21.608]  You're haughty.
[01:01:21.868 --> 01:01:22.809]  You're full of yourselves.
[01:01:25.050 --> 01:01:27.571]  So I guess that goes pretty far.
[01:01:27.611 --> 01:01:30.972]  You're like a schizophrenic homeless person that thinks they're the Queen of England.
[01:01:32.473 --> 01:01:32.953]  But you're not.
[01:01:34.274 --> 01:01:34.734]  You're crazy.
[01:01:35.660 --> 01:01:36.180]  You're freaks.
[01:01:36.340 --> 01:01:36.841]  You're a joke.
[01:01:37.321 --> 01:01:41.964]  Joe Biggs, let's go back to the fellow you were talking to and get his take on where he sees all this going.
[01:01:43.185 --> 01:01:46.607]  Earlier you were saying that you feel like they're being allowed to slip through the cracks.
[01:01:46.627 --> 01:01:47.207]  What do you mean by that?
[01:01:48.088 --> 01:01:49.168]  I don't know if they're being allowed.
[01:01:49.309 --> 01:01:53.971]  It's just that we aren't using our resources efficiently by spying on every single American.
[01:01:53.991 --> 01:01:56.333]  I think that that's kind of a problem where
[01:01:57.168 --> 01:02:01.111]  You know, we could be using those resources, get a warrant, go after people that... Well, it's also unconstitutional.
[01:02:01.131 --> 01:02:04.894]  ...leave the country and come back and seem to take on a whole new kind of personality.
[01:02:04.914 --> 01:02:06.796]  And that's apparently what this guy did.
[01:02:07.096 --> 01:02:08.277]  And there was warning signs.
[01:02:08.337 --> 01:02:10.419]  Other people are now coming out saying that that was going on.
[01:02:11.414 --> 01:02:12.155]  We should have known about it.
[01:02:30.760 --> 01:02:34.241]  Just stand your eyes and watch what's going on in this community and not do anything about it.
[01:02:34.261 --> 01:02:35.382]  That's why I'm here today.
[01:02:35.422 --> 01:02:39.703]  I'm here to say how I feel and tell people that it starts in your neighborhood.
[01:02:39.723 --> 01:02:43.164]  You got to go visit your family and your friends and your neighbors.
[01:02:43.204 --> 01:02:44.364]  Get to know who lives on your street.
[01:02:44.424 --> 01:02:45.165]  It all starts there.
[01:02:45.425 --> 01:02:52.487]  Not only for knowing who lives in your neighborhood, but if it comes to it, those are the people that are going to be with you when this stuff happens.
[01:02:52.827 --> 01:02:55.528]  So get to know your friends, get to know your neighbors, make them friends.
[01:02:56.175 --> 01:02:59.718]  And, uh, and, uh, you know... What do you think about the Second Amendment?
[01:02:59.898 --> 01:03:00.638]  The Second Amendment is 100%.
[01:03:01.019 --> 01:03:01.799]  Should not be touched.
[01:03:01.819 --> 01:03:02.620]  That's right.
[01:03:02.660 --> 01:03:05.962]  What would have happened if somebody had been armed in there with a concealed carry?
[01:03:05.982 --> 01:03:08.284]  What do you think would have happened if someone could have had a concealed carry in there?
[01:03:08.664 --> 01:03:11.266]  I think this whole thing would have been finished in about three seconds.
[01:03:11.286 --> 01:03:11.766]  That's right.
[01:03:11.786 --> 01:03:12.687]  He got his ass blown off.
[01:03:13.527 --> 01:03:15.048]  All right, I got two more guys over here.
[01:03:16.009 --> 01:03:16.810]  Come on in, fellas.
[01:03:17.410 --> 01:03:18.211]  All right, so tell me your name.
[01:03:18.231 --> 01:03:18.551]  What's up, Joe?
[01:03:18.571 --> 01:03:19.712]  I'm Phil from Virginia.
[01:03:19.872 --> 01:03:20.432]  From Virginia.
[01:03:20.512 --> 01:03:21.413]  I'm Chuck from San Bernardino.
[01:03:21.778 --> 01:03:23.359]  Alright, so you have some points to make.
[01:03:23.379 --> 01:03:24.880]  Tell us what you think about this entire situation.
[01:03:25.160 --> 01:03:26.581]  Basically, I didn't know you guys were here.
[01:03:26.601 --> 01:03:31.924]  I was vacationing in LA with my family and just came up to talk to some people to see what the word on the street is.
[01:03:32.024 --> 01:03:40.589]  You've got mainstream liberal rags saying that prayer doesn't work, putting up Ted Cruz and different ones calling for prayer in this situation.
[01:03:41.570 --> 01:03:42.370]  It's nothing but.
[01:03:42.811 --> 01:03:45.572]  There's people here together, we all held hands, we said a prayer.
[01:03:45.973 --> 01:03:47.454]  What else can you do with something like this?
[01:03:48.835 --> 01:03:57.539]  As my man here just mentioned, the president, the liberal media, everyone else is going to use this as another opportunity to come for our Second Amendment and human rights.
[01:03:57.920 --> 01:03:59.480]  And I'm not having that.
[01:04:00.421 --> 01:04:02.022]  What do you think about everything that's going on?
[01:04:02.262 --> 01:04:06.444]  What you've seen in the mainstream media, how this entire event's been played out and portrayed?
[01:04:07.253 --> 01:04:11.355]  Well, actually, the mainstream media don't even watch it anymore because it's so phony and fake, you know?
[01:04:11.835 --> 01:04:13.356]  This situation here was tragic.
[01:04:13.416 --> 01:04:15.196]  I've been born and raised here all my life.
[01:04:15.216 --> 01:04:16.897]  Matter of fact, I was on the way to Vegas.
[01:04:17.797 --> 01:04:19.378]  I kept asking my brother, should I turn around?
[01:04:19.418 --> 01:04:20.659]  He said, no, it's taken care of.
[01:04:20.719 --> 01:04:22.880]  But my thing is, this is a strong city.
[01:04:23.320 --> 01:04:27.642]  I really don't want it to be associated with the, uh, whatever he's calling it later on tonight.
[01:04:27.742 --> 01:04:28.622]  This is a great city.
[01:04:29.142 --> 01:04:34.845]  And it is sad that we're going to be the one to represent, you know, the taking away of the Second Amendment.
[01:04:35.225 --> 01:04:35.705]  And it's sad.
[01:04:36.594 --> 01:04:36.814]  Sick.
[01:04:36.834 --> 01:04:42.235]  So what do you think, is that what you think he's going to do tonight when he addresses the nation during prime time?
[01:04:42.255 --> 01:04:44.536]  Do you think he's going to try to take steps?
[01:04:44.636 --> 01:04:45.376]  Hold on, stay there.
[01:04:45.396 --> 01:04:46.396]  That's an important question.
[01:04:46.416 --> 01:04:46.996]  70 seconds.
[01:04:47.056 --> 01:04:48.277]  I want to come back and talk to this fella.
[01:04:48.297 --> 01:04:48.757]  He's got it.
[01:04:49.017 --> 01:04:53.498]  They're going to use the 14 dead as a sacrifice to take our Second Amendment.
[01:04:53.518 --> 01:04:57.359]  It'll be known, according to the Attorney General, as the San Bernardino Address.
[01:04:58.379 --> 01:05:01.880]  And they're going to start implementing it on December 7th, Pearl Harbor Day.
[01:05:02.680 --> 01:05:03.360]  Think about that.
[01:05:04.500 --> 01:05:05.565]  You talk about a sneak attack.
[01:05:06.249 --> 01:05:07.937]  I mean, this is all symbolism, folks.
[01:05:09.901 --> 01:05:13.602]  Secret 12, InfoWarsLife's vitamin B12 formulation.
[01:05:13.862 --> 01:05:19.984]  Most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic and cannot be properly absorbed by the body.
[01:05:20.184 --> 01:05:27.166]  That's why for real results, so many are having to turn to painful B12 injections, which are known to have higher absorption rates.
[01:05:27.466 --> 01:05:36.248]  InfoWarsLife.com is excited to announce that we can bring you our most bioactive, powerful form of B12 that has been developed with our exclusive perfected process.
[01:05:36.568 --> 01:05:42.492]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimedical-grade, bioavailable, coenzyme forms of B12.
[01:05:42.752 --> 01:05:47.515]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections, and adenosylcobalamin.
[01:05:47.575 --> 01:05:50.917]  Secret 12 is simply taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.
[01:05:51.177 --> 01:05:52.798]  No needles, no injections.
[01:05:53.058 --> 01:05:54.559]  Don't take my word for it.
[01:05:54.719 --> 01:05:55.740]  Try it for yourself.
[01:05:55.900 --> 01:05:57.481]  Discover the secret, Secret 12.
[01:05:58.221 --> 01:06:02.484]  Secure your revolutionary Secret 12 formula right now at Infowarslife.com.
[01:06:03.665 --> 01:06:26.140]  Gentlemen, we have called you together to inform you that we are going to overthrow the United States government.
[01:06:26.421 --> 01:06:32.345]  Leading a frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:33.243 --> 01:06:35.744]  You still think that jet fuel brought down the World Trade Center?
[01:06:39.004 --> 01:06:40.305]  Does anybody else see a problem here?
[01:06:42.165 --> 01:06:47.767]  If the government has nothing to hide, why are they so afraid to answer a few questions?
[01:06:47.807 --> 01:06:56.089]  This story does not add up.
[01:06:56.209 --> 01:06:56.509]  Folks,
[01:06:57.930 --> 01:06:59.011]  This is a false flag.
[01:06:59.031 --> 01:06:59.971]  The borders were open.
[01:06:59.991 --> 01:07:01.212]  They let the jihadis in.
[01:07:01.252 --> 01:07:02.593]  They let them attack in Europe.
[01:07:03.153 --> 01:07:03.593]  You name it.
[01:07:03.633 --> 01:07:07.395]  They covered up the attacks at Fort Hood and said that wasn't a terror attack.
[01:07:07.435 --> 01:07:13.538]  The Marine Corps Recruiting Center, the Army Recruiting Center, the attacks on trains, the attacks, they cover it up.
[01:07:15.520 --> 01:07:25.445]  Now certainly the ruling establishment has a plan to come out of this and they think we're so politically correct, so dumb, that they are going to blame the Second Amendment
[01:07:27.102 --> 01:07:47.859]  for it and restricted they've made the announcement is coming up in about two hours or less seven o'clock central and people are upset on the ground in san bernardino california where joe biggs is out there talking to him but remember saudi arabia twenty-eight pages congressional report sensor but i've had the congressman on i've talked to the senators it's come out
[01:07:48.931 --> 01:07:53.132]  Saudi Arabia, the government, ran the attacks on 9-11 and our Pentagon stood down under orders.
[01:07:53.152 --> 01:07:55.273]  9-11 was an inside job.
[01:07:55.293 --> 01:08:01.635]  Doesn't mean it was run by the fire department or run by the Pentagon, but there were elements in our government that knew bare minimum.
[01:08:01.815 --> 01:08:09.378]  And obviously it goes further than that, but if I've got Al Capone on income tax fraud, then I'll get him on everything else later.
[01:08:09.778 --> 01:08:10.998]  The point is we've been proven right.
[01:08:12.519 --> 01:08:13.499]  So what's the plan now?
[01:08:13.979 --> 01:08:18.241]  Folks, if they bring in millions of jihadi potentials, you're going to have thousands that attack.
[01:08:20.134 --> 01:08:24.815]  And then they're going to use that to take our freedoms, just like they attacked Iraq when Saudi Arabia attacked us.
[01:08:25.135 --> 01:08:30.116]  You're like, why would you attack the Second Amendment and gun owners and conservatives and libertarians and Christians and veterans?
[01:08:30.156 --> 01:08:35.757]  And why would you come out and blame conservatives and people after the attack Wednesday with no evidence?
[01:08:35.817 --> 01:08:40.418]  And why would you say stop praying for victims when prayer has been proven medically to help people?
[01:08:40.618 --> 01:08:42.179]  It's proven to bring people together.
[01:08:43.599 --> 01:08:44.559]  It's proven to heal.
[01:08:45.599 --> 01:08:47.740]  How about people do whatever they want when they're grieving dead?
[01:08:49.480 --> 01:08:58.084]  But no, you gotta shame at the Huffington Post and MSNBC and make fun of Christians and make fun of people coming up there to the health department to pray with the families.
[01:08:58.384 --> 01:09:00.525]  Well, we've talked to the families and they don't like you.
[01:09:00.546 --> 01:09:02.006]  We're going to be interviewing some of them this week.
[01:09:03.307 --> 01:09:09.710]  The families that have lost people and that have been demonized and told, maybe you deserved it because you were a Christian or you were a Jew.
[01:09:09.990 --> 01:09:13.312]  They're actually in the news saying people might have deserved it.
[01:09:15.700 --> 01:09:18.646]  I'm telling you, the left in this country has become mentally ill and sick.
[01:09:19.268 --> 01:09:23.296]  The right wing's got problems too, but my God, it scares me to see this.
[01:09:23.617 --> 01:09:24.699]  So I want to play a minute of...
[01:09:26.377 --> 01:09:34.085]  December 7th, 1941, a day that lives in infamy, from President Franklin Delano Roosevelt talking about the sneak attack on our country.
[01:09:34.285 --> 01:09:37.988]  Well, let me tell you, this is a false flag bringing in these jihadis, letting them attack.
[01:09:38.709 --> 01:09:43.934]  They knew all three reporters we had in upstate New York, even though only one of them was announced to be there.
[01:09:44.174 --> 01:09:48.559]  They knew their cell phones and Homeland Security called them and asked, why are you at Islamoburg?
[01:09:50.865 --> 01:09:53.947]  And they told him, we're tracking everywhere you are and know what town you're in.
[01:09:54.267 --> 01:09:56.468]  I talked to the Homeland Security and State Police.
[01:09:57.509 --> 01:10:06.975]  He admitted they were surveilling my people as if they were going to do something wrong when they know full well in their own analysis and their own assessment and their own
[01:10:09.443 --> 01:10:10.865]  ...algorithm that that's pure baloney.
[01:10:11.166 --> 01:10:15.632]  And it's because we are good, and are exposing what's happening, they want us shut down.
[01:10:15.873 --> 01:10:17.996]  And that doesn't even mean Homeland Security itself is bad.
[01:10:18.356 --> 01:10:21.000]  But the people on top of it giving the orders are traitors.
[01:10:21.897 --> 01:10:23.257]  Mr. Vice President, Mr. Speaker,
[01:10:52.148 --> 01:11:10.335]  Members of the Senate, of the House of Representatives, yesterday, December 7th, 1941, a date which will live in infamy.
[01:11:12.156 --> 01:11:17.318]  The United States of America was suddenly and deliberately attacked
[01:11:18.644 --> 01:11:23.027]  By naval and air forces of the Empire of Japan.
[01:11:24.728 --> 01:11:44.782]  The United States was at peace with that nation, and at the solicitation of Japan, was still in conversation with its government and its emperor, looking toward the maintenance of peace in the Pacific.
[01:11:46.584 --> 01:11:46.944]  Indeed,
[01:11:48.033 --> 01:12:14.229]  One hour after Japanese air squadrons had commenced bombing in the American island of Oahu, the Japanese ambassador to the United States and his colleague delivered to our Secretary of State a formal reply to a recent American message.
[01:12:14.893 --> 01:12:23.795]  Japan has therefore undertaken a surprise offensive extending throughout the Pacific area.
[01:12:26.495 --> 01:12:32.936]  The facts of yesterday and today speak for themselves.
[01:12:35.137 --> 01:12:42.158]  No matter how long it may take us to overcome this premeditated invasion,
[01:12:43.095 --> 01:12:48.999]  The American people, in their righteous might, will win through to absolute victory.
[01:12:49.139 --> 01:12:53.622]  The only thing we have to fear is fear of self.
[01:12:54.642 --> 01:13:08.391]  In our armed forces, with the unbounding determination of our people, we will gain the inevitable triumph, so help us God.
[01:13:08.531 --> 01:13:09.592]  Now, let's stop right there.
[01:13:11.052 --> 01:13:12.794]  Here's the bottom line, the reason I parallel this.
[01:13:12.894 --> 01:13:20.442]  We're going to expose the globalist Islamic invasion plan, the plan to take our guns, the plan for medical tyranny, Obamacare, New World Order, all of it.
[01:13:20.482 --> 01:13:20.862]  It's over.
[01:13:22.044 --> 01:13:24.366]  No matter what you do, we now know you're the enemy.
[01:13:24.426 --> 01:13:27.970]  No matter what you pull, we know the RINO Republicans work for you as well.
[01:13:29.111 --> 01:13:30.813]  We're aware of you trying to take down Europe.
[01:13:30.873 --> 01:13:33.456]  We're aware of you trying to destabilize the Middle East and Africa.
[01:13:34.465 --> 01:13:39.886]  And all the horrible things they've done, taking out Libya, taking out all these other countries, destabilizing these areas, these continents.
[01:13:40.846 --> 01:13:42.947]  This will come out, and I think they've jumped the shark.
[01:13:43.347 --> 01:13:47.708]  Go back to Joe Biggs and the man you were talking to who almost had tears in his eyes about how evil this is.
[01:13:47.748 --> 01:13:48.668]  He hit the nail on the head.
[01:13:48.928 --> 01:13:50.788]  They're going to use these dead, Joe.
[01:13:51.468 --> 01:13:54.069]  They're going to use these dead to try to sacrifice the Second Amendment.
[01:13:54.309 --> 01:13:55.229]  Please have him continue.
[01:13:56.069 --> 01:13:58.730]  Alright, so you were saying how they're going to use this event to
[01:14:00.626 --> 01:14:02.287]  Basically, just take away the Second Amendment.
[01:14:02.307 --> 01:14:04.568]  I mean, what other points do you want to make about this?
[01:14:05.008 --> 01:14:05.248]  Chuck?
[01:14:05.548 --> 01:14:07.609]  Well, about this city, we're a strong city.
[01:14:07.790 --> 01:14:09.510]  We are a loving city.
[01:14:09.530 --> 01:14:11.011]  Sure, we have problems here and there.
[01:14:11.031 --> 01:14:14.053]  We're going through a bankruptcy, and this is just another black eye to our city.
[01:14:14.573 --> 01:14:17.795]  It's sad what happened, but it's really terrible.
[01:14:17.815 --> 01:14:22.597]  You're going to put the name of your bill, or whatever you call it, and you're going to add our name to it, our city.
[01:14:23.157 --> 01:14:23.978]  What is that all about?
[01:14:24.458 --> 01:14:28.620]  Were we the last stop to the plan, or what?
[01:14:29.534 --> 01:14:29.914]  I don't get it.
[01:14:29.934 --> 01:14:30.615]  It's terrible.
[01:14:31.956 --> 01:14:32.176]  Yeah.
[01:14:32.757 --> 01:14:33.317]  It's pretty horrible.
[01:14:33.357 --> 01:14:34.298]  Other points you'd like to make?
[01:14:34.318 --> 01:14:36.140]  Do you have any other points you'd like to make about this?
[01:14:36.440 --> 01:14:42.105]  No, I'm just glad you guys came out here so we can get some real news because the media out there, all the other channels are worthless.
[01:14:42.806 --> 01:14:43.867]  Just worthless.
[01:14:43.967 --> 01:14:45.028]  And I thank you guys for being out here.
[01:14:45.048 --> 01:14:45.729]  Well, God bless you, Chuck.
[01:14:45.749 --> 01:14:46.009]  Thank you.
[01:14:46.109 --> 01:14:46.809]  Let's talk to this lady.
[01:14:46.830 --> 01:14:47.270]  What's your name?
[01:14:47.530 --> 01:14:48.311]  My name is Carmel Rowe.
[01:14:48.351 --> 01:14:51.814]  All right, so what do you think about this whole incident?
[01:14:52.210 --> 01:14:54.090]  Well, I'm glad that you are here to report the real news.
[01:14:54.130 --> 01:15:01.652]  I haven't had cable TV in nine years and follow Alex Jones a lot and I get most of my news from there, but... That's who you're talking to right now?
[01:15:01.932 --> 01:15:13.614]  But what I have to say is that they really picked the wrong city to preach anti-guns because we have a city attorney that was recalled and our city attorney specifically told us the city of San Bernardino to grab your guns and lock your doors.
[01:15:14.054 --> 01:15:16.875]  We here in San Bernardino, we have more of a problem than just terrorism.
[01:15:17.275 --> 01:15:18.715]  We have domestic terrorism.
[01:15:18.755 --> 01:15:19.095]  We have
[01:15:19.451 --> 01:15:24.874]  We have reasons that we should be walking around with a gun and San Bernardino would not support anti-guns.
[01:15:24.954 --> 01:15:27.176]  San Bernardino is for guns.
[01:15:27.196 --> 01:15:31.858]  I mean, the reason our police were equipped with those kind of guns is because they need them for their daily lives.
[01:15:32.339 --> 01:15:34.220]  We, the people, we need to stand up.
[01:15:34.360 --> 01:15:35.201]  We need to wake up.
[01:15:35.621 --> 01:15:36.741]  And they're training our children.
[01:15:36.781 --> 01:15:37.602]  We need to train ours.
[01:15:37.822 --> 01:15:42.205]  We treat our children like they're liabilities and they treat theirs like they're assets.
[01:15:42.245 --> 01:15:45.227]  And if we don't wake up, we have no hope for our future.
[01:15:45.247 --> 01:15:46.447]  Our government will not help us.
[01:15:46.507 --> 01:15:49.249]  And this is just me calling out to San Bernardino as
[01:15:49.557 --> 01:15:50.438]  Let this unite us.
[01:15:50.478 --> 01:15:51.879]  Let this unite us as a people.
[01:15:51.939 --> 01:15:53.380]  Let this unite us as a nation.
[01:15:53.420 --> 01:15:56.643]  Let us treat our children as assets rather than liabilities.
[01:15:56.943 --> 01:16:02.067]  Let us say our prayers and let us all come correct because the end of the world is coming and we're all not helping it.
[01:16:02.167 --> 01:16:04.649]  So... What do you think about uh... Hold on Joe, we gotta go to break.
[01:16:04.669 --> 01:16:05.530]  We'll come back and let her finish.
[01:16:05.550 --> 01:16:07.091]  The end of the world as we know it.
[01:16:07.171 --> 01:16:07.612]  Stay with us.
[01:16:08.772 --> 01:16:11.975]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[01:16:12.275 --> 01:16:20.281]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[01:16:20.522 --> 01:16:25.546]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[01:16:25.946 --> 01:16:28.228]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?

[01:16:39.829 --> 01:16:41.930]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[01:16:42.030 --> 01:16:46.752]  You probably noticed I've been more focused, less brain fog, more energy, and it's because of BrainForce.
[01:16:47.012 --> 01:16:50.153]  There's always hidden additives in your food, even organic food has hidden additives.
[01:16:50.313 --> 01:16:53.534]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[01:16:53.794 --> 01:16:55.595]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[01:16:55.775 --> 01:16:59.756]  It doesn't have stimulants, it doesn't have garbage in it, it has natural things that do it clean.

[01:17:08.419 --> 01:17:16.585]  We have been fighting this war tirelessly with you at our side, day in and day out, exposing the ludicrous lies and criminal operations of the globalists.
[01:17:16.765 --> 01:17:18.767]  And we're starting to see big effects.
[01:17:19.087 --> 01:17:20.608]  And the word is getting out.
[01:17:20.969 --> 01:17:22.870]  The globalists want to make us dependent.
[01:17:23.050 --> 01:17:26.533]  And as Napoleon famously said, an army marches on its stomach.
[01:17:26.793 --> 01:17:31.757]  Ammunition, food, and supplies form the backbone of any offensive, including the Info War.
[01:17:32.277 --> 01:17:35.199]  And our enemies admit they're losing the Info War.
[01:17:39.221 --> 01:17:45.503]  With this in mind, we have held strong to our principles and the decision to refuse any money from globalists or government.
[01:17:45.723 --> 01:17:52.525]  We are funding our crusade against tyranny the old-fashioned way with pure free-market, free-will capitalism.

[01:18:09.389 --> 01:18:10.789]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[01:18:11.049 --> 01:18:12.349]  You can't survive without it.
[01:18:12.529 --> 01:18:13.429]  But where do you get it?
[01:18:13.729 --> 01:18:19.491]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new groundbreaking gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.
[01:18:19.711 --> 01:18:25.432]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.
[01:18:25.632 --> 01:18:42.516]  Pairing the unprecedented superfiltration power of an all-new gravity block core with a hybrid chromatic shell, it removes up to 99.999% of impurities, including bacteria, viruses, fluoride, disinfectants, volatile organic contaminants, and hormones.
[01:18:42.816 --> 01:18:43.736]  I want more candy!
[01:18:43.776 --> 01:18:45.017]  I want more video games!
[01:18:45.377 --> 01:18:45.637]  Mine!
[01:18:45.657 --> 01:18:45.737]  Mine!
[01:18:45.797 --> 01:18:45.977]  Mine!
[01:19:12.466 --> 01:19:21.868]  And it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and help children focus.
[01:19:22.209 --> 01:19:24.769]  All of our children are hit with modern mind control.
[01:19:24.909 --> 01:19:28.270]  Television, music, fast food, GMOs, sugars, you name it.
[01:19:28.450 --> 01:19:34.472]  Young humans have not yet developed their nervous system and are being hammered daily by globalist concoctions.
[01:19:34.772 --> 01:19:39.613]  It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down and then are put on dangerous psychotropic drugs.
[01:19:39.913 --> 01:19:46.097]  Working with my team, we set out to find the best formula with the highest quality ingredients that children would actually like and take.
[01:19:46.297 --> 01:19:53.782]  We worked with the leading manufacturer in nutritional supplements that are safe for children to bring you the most affordable and powerful calming formula out there.
[01:19:54.042 --> 01:20:01.326]  Introducing ChildEase with herbs and calming extracts like chamomile and lemon balm and essential nutrients that taste great.

[01:20:12.891 --> 01:20:15.593]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:26.500 --> 01:20:28.262]  We're now 1 hour 40 minutes out from a speech.
[01:20:28.842 --> 01:20:37.108]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:20:38.135 --> 01:20:41.016]  And I'll be live with Facebook mentions at InfoWars.com.
[01:20:41.036 --> 01:20:42.997]  We'll have a link to the feed tonight.
[01:20:44.657 --> 01:20:46.758]  Or just go to Alexander Emmerich Jones on Facebook.
[01:20:48.198 --> 01:20:51.899]  And when he gives a speech, I'll be there covering it and then giving some analysis after.
[01:20:52.560 --> 01:20:56.121]  And yeah, I was having a Christmas party with my parents over to do the tree with my kids, but...
[01:20:57.156 --> 01:20:59.922]  Sorry, that's just got to take a back seat to the stuff that's going on in this country.
[01:20:59.942 --> 01:21:05.132]  Because all this prosperity, all the freedom we have is because people fought and died for it.
[01:21:05.513 --> 01:21:08.058]  Least I can do is cover it seven days a week.
[01:21:09.360 --> 01:21:12.362]  I want to go back to Joe Biggs and San Bernardino and some of the folks he's talking to.
[01:21:12.382 --> 01:21:13.503]  We've got loaded phones.
[01:21:14.244 --> 01:21:15.545]  Boeia in Turkey.
[01:21:16.525 --> 01:21:19.288]  Folks calling from all over the world, from Oklahoma to Turkey.
[01:21:19.328 --> 01:21:24.732]  We've got callers from Los Angeles to San Bernardino, from San Antonio to Florida.
[01:21:24.952 --> 01:21:26.773]  We've got everybody calling in.
[01:21:26.793 --> 01:21:29.976]  So we're going to be taking your phone calls and talking to more folks on the street.
[01:21:31.408 --> 01:21:37.351]  At the end of the broadcast, I'll announce the winner of this three-day contest we had for Christmas memes, because they're trying to ban the Christmas tree.
[01:21:37.831 --> 01:21:39.812]  Rob Jacobson will pop in with that.
[01:21:40.812 --> 01:21:42.193]  So stay with us, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:21:42.213 --> 01:21:48.655]  That's kind of a double defense of free speech here tonight on so many different fronts.
[01:21:48.675 --> 01:21:49.656]  We'll be announcing the winner.
[01:21:50.296 --> 01:21:51.937]  But going back to Joe Biggs.
[01:21:52.577 --> 01:21:58.358]  Let's talk to a few other people, and then I want you to ride shotgun with us, Joe, because a lot of these callers want to talk to you as well.
[01:21:58.398 --> 01:22:03.920]  But before we go back to people on the street in San Bernardino, they're in front of the health department on the side of the Jihad massacre.
[01:22:04.300 --> 01:22:05.400]  Other points you'd like to add?
[01:22:06.340 --> 01:22:09.021]  Well, like I said, I mean, it's going to be interesting to see what unfolds tonight.
[01:22:09.961 --> 01:22:13.582]  Really, at the end of the day, our future depends on what's going to go on tonight.
[01:22:13.862 --> 01:22:16.283]  Is he going to use this to spark another war?
[01:22:16.503 --> 01:22:20.844]  Are we going to be pushed into years and years of conflict?
[01:22:21.403 --> 01:22:22.804]  In Syria now, because of this.
[01:22:23.164 --> 01:22:29.067]  When we were trying to take out ISIS, back when they first started, we had the ability to, they ignored it.
[01:22:29.087 --> 01:22:37.291]  Instead they used them, empowered them, gave them weapons and ammunition, and allowed them to go in because they wanted to use them as a tool to take out the Assad regime.
[01:22:37.691 --> 01:22:47.616]  Now that hasn't worked, and now you have Obama finally coming out and addressing, during prime time, in a rare event, at the Oval Office, what he's going to do in his steps to defeat ISIS.
[01:22:48.174 --> 01:22:51.637]  And also, I guarantee you there's going to be stuff about gun control.
[01:22:51.657 --> 01:22:52.117]  That's right.
[01:22:52.157 --> 01:22:53.438]  We need stricter gun control.
[01:22:53.759 --> 01:22:54.399]  But guess what?
[01:22:55.020 --> 01:22:56.981]  Hey, what was it?
[01:22:57.041 --> 01:23:02.405]  One of the guys over there, you said that the governor here was saying that he wanted to reach out to the other states, right?
[01:23:02.465 --> 01:23:04.267]  And push for... Yeah, come here.
[01:23:05.528 --> 01:23:07.950]  Oh yeah, they're creating these coalitions under the UN Strong Cities.
[01:23:10.410 --> 01:23:19.962]  I heard that the governor put out a statement saying that we need to restrict laws better in Arizona and Nevada because that's where the guns are coming from.
[01:23:19.982 --> 01:23:20.923]  Yeah, that's Bloomberg bull.
[01:23:21.384 --> 01:23:23.266]  Just freaking ridiculous.
[01:23:23.386 --> 01:23:26.590]  Yeah, that's Bloomberg diarrhea that he spews out to all the other states.
[01:23:26.650 --> 01:23:28.492]  I want to talk to some more of these folks, but absolutely...
[01:23:29.537 --> 01:23:36.820]  Listen, he is going to announce there's about to be a major jihad, so he can quote protect us from it, and then no one's supposed to say, hey, who brought these folks in?
[01:23:37.420 --> 01:23:41.682]  Or who gave them safe harbor to breed and train in Syria, Iraq, and Saudi Arabia?
[01:23:42.342 --> 01:23:43.343]  They think we're ignorant.
[01:23:43.383 --> 01:23:43.963]  We're not.
[01:23:44.223 --> 01:23:46.064]  And that's why I think they've miscalculated, Joe.
[01:23:47.004 --> 01:23:48.065]  Well, it's just like a drug addict.
[01:23:48.085 --> 01:23:53.027]  A drug addict has to hit rock bottom before they can eventually move forward.
[01:23:53.307 --> 01:23:55.448]  I think these guys are about to come to an end on their streak.
[01:23:55.768 --> 01:23:57.889]  I think they're going to hit rock bottom, and people are going to
[01:23:58.502 --> 01:24:00.505]  See what's really going on behind the curtain.
[01:24:00.826 --> 01:24:02.869]  People are going to understand and wake up and go, what?
[01:24:03.249 --> 01:24:05.833]  You know, these guys have been saying this is going to happen for a long time.
[01:24:06.161 --> 01:24:10.743]  InfoWars has been talking about how the borders purposely left wide open to allow these things to happen.
[01:24:11.023 --> 01:24:12.783]  You know, when we went to Mexico, we showed that.
[01:24:13.123 --> 01:24:14.524]  Showed how easy it is to come across.
[01:24:14.544 --> 01:24:21.186]  And remember, we didn't jihad fearmonger five years ago, ten years ago, because that was mainly synthetic and overseas.
[01:24:21.506 --> 01:24:28.389]  For two years I've been saying they're recruiting, it's real, they've got hundreds of thousands, mainly in the West, they're gearing up to hit us, this is real.
[01:24:28.689 --> 01:24:31.870]  And notice it's now starting, because we do our homework, folks.
[01:24:31.890 --> 01:24:33.010]  This is real.
[01:24:33.411 --> 01:24:36.231]  Now, they allowed it to breed, but I've said this 500 times.
[01:24:36.271 --> 01:24:43.994]  It's like if I bred a bunch of black widows in my basement, and I went to my neighbor's house and dumped them in their bed, do the black widows take orders from me?
[01:24:44.014 --> 01:24:45.975]  Did I give birth to them?
[01:24:46.035 --> 01:24:46.275]  No.
[01:24:46.615 --> 01:24:48.435]  But I'm still aiding and abetting it.
[01:24:48.816 --> 01:24:49.916]  I still open the door.
[01:24:50.356 --> 01:24:55.621]  I still am the main progenitor, the main criminal mastermind of the operation.
[01:24:55.881 --> 01:25:04.529]  And our criminal government and the EU government are following the same policy of bringing them in to attack us, letting them attack us, and then declaring martial law.
[01:25:04.790 --> 01:25:06.932]  I mean, Joe, you were just over there two weeks ago in France.
[01:25:07.172 --> 01:25:08.553]  They've declared martial law!
[01:25:09.094 --> 01:25:09.975]  And it's still going on.
[01:25:10.015 --> 01:25:13.478]  It will continue, the martial law in France, for another month and a half.
[01:25:13.956 --> 01:25:19.978]  You know, they have signed in a bill giving the police the ability, without warrant, to enter anyone's home.
[01:25:20.398 --> 01:25:24.399]  You're not to congregate, you're not to go out, exactly.
[01:25:24.419 --> 01:25:26.259]  The free speech, you have Merkel saying that too.
[01:25:26.579 --> 01:25:31.340]  I mean, it is ridiculous what is going on in this country, and people don't see it, they're not awake to it.
[01:25:31.601 --> 01:25:41.083]  But it's starting to happen, there is a mass awakening going on, but you still have so many people that are just so politically correct, it's just like a disease, a cancer, that's taking over.
[01:25:41.733 --> 01:25:41.993]  It is.
[01:25:42.053 --> 01:25:46.338]  Joe, we're going to come back in the next segment and talk to more folks on the street there, but I want to go to some calls here.
[01:25:46.939 --> 01:25:49.301]  Is it Bolya or Ebolia in Turkey?
[01:25:50.102 --> 01:25:51.203]  Ebolia in Turkey.
[01:25:51.584 --> 01:25:52.124]  You're on the air.
[01:25:52.144 --> 01:25:53.506]  Joe, this caller wants to talk to you too.
[01:25:53.766 --> 01:25:54.366]  Go ahead, Ebolia.
[01:25:54.386 --> 01:25:54.927]  What's your point?
[01:25:55.948 --> 01:25:56.389]  Hi, Alex.
[01:25:56.449 --> 01:25:56.809]  How are you?
[01:25:57.049 --> 01:25:57.249]  Good.
[01:25:57.290 --> 01:25:57.570]  Go ahead.
[01:25:57.590 --> 01:25:57.890]  Welcome.
[01:25:58.951 --> 01:25:59.252]  Okay.
[01:25:59.272 --> 01:26:04.257]  So there's a lot of political problems going on here in Turkey.
[01:26:04.884 --> 01:26:12.308]  And I need to tell you that politicians of Turkey, they do not represent the people of this country.
[01:26:12.728 --> 01:26:14.449]  They totally hijacked our government.
[01:26:15.049 --> 01:26:15.609]  I know.
[01:26:15.709 --> 01:26:21.012]  And they're planning a war and I sometimes need to communicate.
[01:26:21.032 --> 01:26:24.854]  When I ride the bus, I see a lot of people from ISIS.
[01:26:26.055 --> 01:26:28.797]  And they watch these jihad videos.
[01:26:29.137 --> 01:26:37.021]  I don't even know Arabic in order to interpret these because jihad is a universal pretty much word right now and nobody can understand what it means.
[01:26:37.822 --> 01:26:39.803]  They are finding these people.
[01:26:40.663 --> 01:26:46.526]  They take them to the Turkish President's wife's hospital and they heal them over there.
[01:26:46.566 --> 01:26:47.567]  They give them ammunition.
[01:26:47.607 --> 01:26:48.087]  They feed them.
[01:26:48.107 --> 01:26:49.007]  They give them blankets.
[01:26:49.027 --> 01:26:49.968]  They give them weapons.
[01:26:51.206 --> 01:26:54.047]  And they gave them a Turkish ID.
[01:26:55.027 --> 01:26:57.568]  Most of them got a citizenship in order to vote.
[01:26:58.048 --> 01:26:59.569]  That's how they rigged the elections.
[01:27:00.089 --> 01:27:07.411]  And in the elections in Istanbul, there were way more people than the people who needed to vote.
[01:27:08.106 --> 01:27:14.890]  Let me just back you up, because you're a caller from Turkey, and if you're a new listener, everything that this caller from Turkey is saying has been admitted.
[01:27:15.370 --> 01:27:18.192]  Erdogan had lost early elections, then he magically wins.
[01:27:18.572 --> 01:27:20.773]  He's brought in probably a million jihadis.
[01:27:21.094 --> 01:27:26.296]  They're training them, they're arming them, they're buying their oil, they're giving them weapons, they give them artillery support.
[01:27:26.777 --> 01:27:28.238]  The Russians are starting to fight back.
[01:27:28.558 --> 01:27:33.741]  So now the Turkish president today, this is Reuters, is threatening to blow up Russian ships next.
[01:27:34.421 --> 01:27:35.862]  I mean, this is crazy!
[01:27:36.322 --> 01:27:36.962]  And you're right.
[01:27:37.302 --> 01:27:39.803]  He knows he's about to get kicked out if he doesn't start a war.
[01:27:40.123 --> 01:27:41.384]  Most Turks are against this.
[01:27:41.424 --> 01:27:51.027]  Let's be clear, from the polls I've seen, what is it like to watch this happening and to know your dictator may bring us to World War III?
[01:27:51.147 --> 01:27:56.409]  Actually, as you said earlier, I think it's World War IV because the war is going on in our minds right now.
[01:27:56.929 --> 01:28:02.551]  And most people submitted themselves to this tyrannical government.
[01:28:03.340 --> 01:28:06.242]  And I think the U.S.
[01:28:06.382 --> 01:28:21.709]  already assembled, they assembled the government already, world government, and they are having some problems because they are on the final gear right now because they are trying, they're rushing to accomplish their goals so quick.
[01:28:22.089 --> 01:28:30.213]  And I think soon the World War 4, which is going to be a physical war, Armageddon or whatever you want to call it,
[01:28:30.638 --> 01:28:37.582]  It will take place around here in Turkey and there, yesterday, they sent Turkish troops in Iraq, legally.
[01:28:37.982 --> 01:28:39.343]  That's right, I haven't even gotten to that.
[01:28:39.643 --> 01:28:46.486]  Not only is Turkey threatening to blow up Russian ships, the Med, for no reason, they now have sent troops into Iraq and Iraq's threatening war.
[01:28:46.506 --> 01:28:49.588]  I mean, Turkey has been told by NATO, start a war, folks.
[01:28:49.628 --> 01:28:50.308]  This is insane.
[01:28:50.729 --> 01:28:52.029]  Thank you, sir, from Turkey.
[01:28:52.049 --> 01:28:52.770]  Thank you for calling.
[01:28:53.470 --> 01:28:57.571]  I'm gonna get Joe Biggs' take on that, and then talk to some other folks on the ground when we come back.
[01:28:57.871 --> 01:29:01.773]  We'll also pan around during the break, give you some of the shots out there on the grounds.
[01:29:01.793 --> 01:29:08.175]  You can see the crowds that are out there at the site of the radical Islamic caliphate attack as we investigate.
[01:29:08.875 --> 01:29:14.241]  Hillary Clinton recently said that all rape victims should be believed.
[01:29:14.542 --> 01:29:24.573]  So during a campaign event in New Hampshire today, she was confronted by a woman in the audience who asked her about the women who accused her husband of rape.
[01:29:24.633 --> 01:29:31.042]  Well, I would say that everybody should be believed at first until they are disbelieved based on evidence.
[01:29:41.195 --> 01:29:48.139]  Well, based on the evidence, Hillary, your husband has a long history of sexual assault and rape.
[01:29:48.199 --> 01:29:50.280]  Well, Hillary's the one who runs the cover-up.
[01:29:50.620 --> 01:29:57.544]  Hillary is the point person to silence these women, lest they get in the way of the Clintons' lust for power and wealth.
[01:29:57.584 --> 01:30:04.788]  That was political strategist Roger Stone on the Alex Jones Show talking about his book, The Clintons' War on Women.
[01:30:04.948 --> 01:30:07.670]  And you can learn more right now at InfoWars.com.

[01:31:09.437 --> 01:31:09.977]  I want more candy!
[01:31:09.997 --> 01:31:11.078]  I want more video games!
[01:31:11.138 --> 01:31:11.918]  Mine, mine, mine!
[01:31:12.659 --> 01:31:22.023]  And it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and help children focus.
[01:31:22.383 --> 01:31:25.005]  All of our children are hit with modern mind control.
[01:31:25.085 --> 01:31:28.426]  Television, music, fast food, GMOs, sugars, you name it.
[01:31:28.647 --> 01:31:34.670]  Young humans have not yet developed their nervous system and are being hammered daily by globalist concoctions.
[01:31:34.970 --> 01:31:37.491]  It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down.
[01:31:37.691 --> 01:31:39.811]  And then are put on dangerous psychotropic drugs.
[01:31:40.091 --> 01:31:46.252]  Working with my team, we set out to find the best formula with the highest quality ingredients that children would actually like and take.
[01:31:46.472 --> 01:31:53.954]  We worked with the leading manufacturer in nutritional supplements that are safe for children to bring you the most affordable and powerful calming formula out there.

[01:32:20.903 --> 01:32:25.926]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.

[01:33:22.155 --> 01:33:23.676]  We are on the march.
[01:33:23.976 --> 01:33:26.399]  The Empire is on the run.
[01:33:27.139 --> 01:33:32.264]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:32.564 --> 01:33:35.707]  I'm waiting in my cold cell.
[01:33:39.199 --> 01:33:44.883]  A Darden in Los Angeles, Scott in Pennsylvania, Drake in San Antonio, Kyle in Arizona, Douglas in Florida, and others.
[01:33:44.903 --> 01:33:45.924]  Your calls are coming up.
[01:33:46.684 --> 01:33:52.549]  The toll free number to join us is 877-789-2539 on this live Sunday worldwide broadcast.
[01:33:54.550 --> 01:33:58.233]  You see the sands of time for this Republic and the Free West are running low.
[01:33:58.253 --> 01:34:05.278]  And it's time to understand that if you pull back geopolitically,
[01:34:08.740 --> 01:34:10.581]  You realize this is part of a larger plan.
[01:34:11.261 --> 01:34:17.803]  What Western government would bring in millions of radical jihadis, potential jihadis, call them refugees.
[01:34:19.904 --> 01:34:22.265]  You know they're not letting the Christians or non-radical Muslims in.
[01:34:22.305 --> 01:34:27.947]  They're letting Wahhabist Sunnis with fake passports, 80 plus percent, into Syria.
[01:34:29.608 --> 01:34:31.728]  And then when they can't take over there, they come into Europe.
[01:34:32.008 --> 01:34:32.669]  Then they come here.
[01:34:33.449 --> 01:34:36.170]  Our government knows a large percentage
[01:34:38.052 --> 01:34:42.014]  Probably 50-60% are military-age men that were jihadis.
[01:34:44.736 --> 01:34:46.517]  And they're bringing them here as sleeper cells, folks.
[01:34:48.358 --> 01:34:54.942]  That's a checkmate over America and Europe, when you've got millions of people, with large percentages of them being sleeper cells.
[01:34:55.363 --> 01:35:04.188]  Do you know, if you've studied military history, if you've studied deeper, darker public text, on what a 10-man team can do in a major city, if they know what they're doing?
[01:35:05.729 --> 01:35:06.610]  With 10 people,
[01:35:07.697 --> 01:35:12.520]  You could take a town like Dallas, Texas or Chicago, Illinois and unleash hell and kill tens of thousands.
[01:35:13.081 --> 01:35:16.123]  I'm not going to go into the tactics, but anybody that wants to research it could.
[01:35:17.384 --> 01:35:18.484]  That's what these guys research.
[01:35:18.524 --> 01:35:22.487]  In fact, I have the Daily Mail saying they're going to hit us with chemical weapons and biological weapons.
[01:35:23.127 --> 01:35:29.952]  They're going to dump different chemicals and gases down high-rise buildings, air conditioning systems, stuff like that.
[01:35:30.592 --> 01:35:33.214]  You can kill almost everybody in a building in about 20 minutes.
[01:35:34.215 --> 01:35:37.277]  I'm not going to go any further with this, but they are here and they are getting ready.
[01:35:38.837 --> 01:35:52.794]  And I think we're so dumb that when the civil emergency hits, the controlled media won't discuss any of this, like for two days they lied and said it wasn't Islamic terror, and then we'll all just, oh, take our guns, take our freedoms, you know, arrest the patriots to keep us safe from your jihad.
[01:35:53.515 --> 01:35:56.759]  Well, the dog doesn't hunt, the duck doesn't fly.
[01:35:59.249 --> 01:36:00.030]  It isn't going to work.
[01:36:00.470 --> 01:36:02.051]  And that's my message to the New World Order.
[01:36:02.671 --> 01:36:11.797]  Joe, I want to go to a bunch of calls here, but let's talk to any other... I want to talk to DART and others in Los Angeles, but anybody else that we should talk to out there in San Bernardino, let's talk to them.
[01:36:12.377 --> 01:36:18.961]  No, but I have some breaking news really quick out of a reporter over in Syria right now, said that a U.S.
[01:36:19.202 --> 01:36:27.367]  jet just conducted airstrikes on a Syrian army base, and now reports of ISIS following that airstrike with a launched attack.
[01:36:28.228 --> 01:36:29.008]  So the U.S.
[01:36:29.088 --> 01:36:33.450]  airstrike happened, and then ISIS came in and helped assault that Assyrian base.
[01:36:34.650 --> 01:36:36.971]  Wow, and I'll follow more of that.
[01:36:37.011 --> 01:36:39.472]  This shows you the type of government we have.
[01:36:39.752 --> 01:36:40.552]  That's what we're dealing with.
[01:36:40.812 --> 01:36:42.513]  What is the publication that's reporting that?
[01:36:43.293 --> 01:36:46.814]  It is a local journalist guy who reports stuff.
[01:36:47.341 --> 01:36:52.704]  In English and Turkish on Syria, Iraq, Kurdistan, Iran, and Yemen.
[01:36:52.924 --> 01:36:58.928]  I know you've been following that particular thing and it's had a lot of accuracy, so we'll continue to then collate a report on that and expand on it.
[01:36:59.328 --> 01:37:01.529]  What do you make of Turkey threatening to blow up Russian ships?
[01:37:02.950 --> 01:37:05.672]  I mean, that's where it ends.
[01:37:06.152 --> 01:37:09.674]  I mean, you know the Russians are going to attack when that happens and then all hell's going to break loose.
[01:37:10.034 --> 01:37:10.935]  Putin's not a punk.
[01:37:10.975 --> 01:37:15.277]  He's not going to sit there and back down and go, alright, I think we're done here.
[01:37:15.697 --> 01:37:16.278]  We're going to give up.
[01:37:17.003 --> 01:37:19.165]  As soon as they do something like that, that will be it.
[01:37:20.085 --> 01:37:21.446]  That will be it.
[01:37:22.667 --> 01:37:24.789]  World War will begin all over again.
[01:37:24.809 --> 01:37:28.651]  Yeah, the Russian submarines are going to pop up and fire cruise missiles at Istanbul.
[01:37:29.912 --> 01:37:31.313]  It'll be ten times worse this time.
[01:37:33.615 --> 01:37:35.777]  Well, that's just who runs our country and runs Turkey.
[01:37:35.797 --> 01:37:37.238]  He's a complete psychopathic scum.
[01:37:38.098 --> 01:37:39.859]  Hadart in Los Angeles, you're on the air.
[01:37:39.919 --> 01:37:40.360]  Go ahead, sir.
[01:37:46.061 --> 01:37:49.864]  Go ahead, if you want to talk, go ahead Hadar.
[01:37:49.984 --> 01:37:50.205]  Hello?
[01:37:50.625 --> 01:37:51.286]  Yes, you're on the air.
[01:37:51.326 --> 01:37:54.068]  I know, it says your name is H-A-D-A-R-T in Los Angeles.
[01:37:54.088 --> 01:37:54.608]  Can you hear me?
[01:37:55.429 --> 01:37:56.130]  No, it's Heather.
[01:37:57.171 --> 01:37:57.751]  Okay, Heather.
[01:37:58.132 --> 01:37:59.513]  They told me Hadar.
[01:37:59.573 --> 01:38:00.694]  Your phone's not that good.
[01:38:00.734 --> 01:38:01.514]  Go ahead and make your point.
[01:38:02.836 --> 01:38:10.002]  My point is that any attempt to restrict our Second Amendment rights should be construed as treason against the American people.
[01:38:10.652 --> 01:38:13.194]  An impeachment proceeding should begin immediately.
[01:38:13.614 --> 01:38:18.517]  It will not make him a martyr, but it might prevent him from being able to call martial law.
[01:38:20.979 --> 01:38:21.319]  You're right.
[01:38:21.339 --> 01:38:22.600]  We have to start impeaching now.
[01:38:22.660 --> 01:38:23.440]  We have to get aggressive.
[01:38:23.460 --> 01:38:26.382]  And I'm sorry if I sounded rude to you with the name spelled wrong on the screen.
[01:38:26.402 --> 01:38:34.267]  It's just, Heather, I'm really upset like you are right now at how our government is run by criminals who are literally orchestrating us into a world war.
[01:38:34.647 --> 01:38:36.068]  What do you think the endgame here is?
[01:38:36.108 --> 01:38:37.149]  Are these people just psychotic?
[01:38:39.358 --> 01:38:48.540]  I think the endgame is that by allowing Syrian refugees in and then trying to disarm us, he is attempting to take over this country.
[01:38:48.841 --> 01:38:51.821]  His whole campaign was, I will bring change.
[01:38:51.901 --> 01:38:53.462]  We'll now know what that change is.
[01:38:53.482 --> 01:38:54.842]  Radical fundamental change.
[01:38:55.622 --> 01:38:56.202]  Exactly.
[01:38:56.222 --> 01:39:01.844]  And I just think that we need to maintain our rights, open carry in all 50 states.
[01:39:02.642 --> 01:39:09.568]  We need to call for his resignation, Loretta Lynch's resignation, and any members of Congress that support his agenda.
[01:39:10.809 --> 01:39:12.831]  I agree with you, Heather, absolutely.
[01:39:12.871 --> 01:39:15.713]  It's time to really get aggressive and really get the word out.
[01:39:15.773 --> 01:39:17.215]  I mean, this is even worse than I thought.
[01:39:17.575 --> 01:39:24.281]  I didn't think the elite was this reckless to try to get total control to make some alliance with radical jihadis and start World War III with the Russians.
[01:39:24.321 --> 01:39:27.444]  I mean, but I guess Napoleon, Hitler, they all go crazy.
[01:39:28.652 --> 01:39:32.554]  And the political correct folks see a guy that's part black, so they just think, do whatever he says.
[01:39:35.076 --> 01:39:35.776]  Thank you so much.
[01:39:35.856 --> 01:39:38.077]  Drake in San Antonio, you're on the air worldwide.
[01:39:38.117 --> 01:39:38.738]  Go ahead, Drake.
[01:39:39.858 --> 01:39:40.118]  Hi.
[01:39:40.239 --> 01:39:43.400]  Tonight, one of the left's goals is to shun the AR-15.
[01:39:43.600 --> 01:39:46.442]  And as you know, California has a 10-magazine rule.
[01:39:46.522 --> 01:39:53.366]  And my question is, did these shooters use the California legal 10-round magazine or the standard 30-round magazine?
[01:39:53.755 --> 01:39:58.317]  I think Joe Biggs has the answer on that, I believe, from the news I saw and some photographs of their guns.
[01:39:58.357 --> 01:40:00.637]  These were 30 round clips, weren't they, Joe?
[01:40:01.098 --> 01:40:05.919]  Yeah, the HCF released a statement saying that they were not legal for California standards.
[01:40:06.780 --> 01:40:09.701]  You mean people that are going to mass murder 14 people broke the law?
[01:40:10.761 --> 01:40:13.742]  Yeah, I mean, they're already going to go out and kill 14 people.
[01:40:13.782 --> 01:40:18.224]  What makes anyone think that they're going to go buy that minimum round clip?
[01:40:18.244 --> 01:40:21.665]  That's like, if I'm on my way to kill 14 people, will I run a stop sign, Joe?
[01:40:22.887 --> 01:40:23.608]  More than likely.
[01:40:25.529 --> 01:40:31.213]  That just shows you the mental illness that is liberalism, that is taking over our country.
[01:40:31.334 --> 01:40:36.257]  I used to hear Savage say that 15 years ago, and I'd go, oh, come on, they're not mentally ill, they just want power.
[01:40:36.277 --> 01:40:37.178]  But they are mentally ill.
[01:40:37.678 --> 01:40:40.140]  They already run the country, why do they want to destroy it?
[01:40:42.942 --> 01:40:46.605]  I mean, if you run something and already conquered it, why would you want to kill it?
[01:40:47.246 --> 01:40:48.547]  I just do not get this, Joe.
[01:40:50.308 --> 01:40:52.630]  It's a full-on PSYOP war going on right now.
[01:40:53.598 --> 01:40:56.200]  You know, it feels like these attacks keep picking up.
[01:40:56.220 --> 01:40:56.780]  They're gearing up.
[01:40:56.800 --> 01:40:57.400]  They're amping up.
[01:40:57.420 --> 01:40:58.761]  They're happening day after day.
[01:40:59.601 --> 01:41:02.903]  And sometimes it almost seems like it's to confuse people.
[01:41:03.304 --> 01:41:05.745]  To get people so spread out and spread thin.
[01:41:05.785 --> 01:41:06.265]  I agree.
[01:41:06.305 --> 01:41:10.328]  Drake of San Antonio, what was your point on, I mean, so yes, these were illegal clips.
[01:41:10.368 --> 01:41:10.608]  Go ahead.
[01:41:11.707 --> 01:41:17.590]  So tonight when Obama says we must restrict guns because they were illegally obtained, boom, he's a liar.
[01:41:17.610 --> 01:41:19.371]  They weren't legal magazines.
[01:41:19.491 --> 01:41:19.971]  I hear you.
[01:41:19.991 --> 01:41:21.532]  Your phone's ringing up, so I'm going to let you go.
[01:41:21.592 --> 01:41:24.433]  But look, of course, we have logical debates with Obama.
[01:41:24.713 --> 01:41:26.794]  He wants our guns to conquer us and enslave us.
[01:41:27.135 --> 01:41:30.696]  Mao Zedong, who he follows, said political power goes out of the barrel of a gun.
[01:41:31.237 --> 01:41:32.577]  He's got guns that protect him.
[01:41:32.897 --> 01:41:34.638]  So does Dianne Feinstein and Al Gore.
[01:41:35.779 --> 01:41:37.620]  Let's go ahead and take another call here.
[01:41:39.005 --> 01:41:40.966]  Let's go ahead and talk to Kyle in Arizona.
[01:41:40.986 --> 01:41:41.807]  You're on the air, Kyle.
[01:41:43.148 --> 01:41:45.050]  Well, thank you for taking my call, Alex.
[01:41:45.430 --> 01:41:45.890]  You bet, brother.
[01:41:45.930 --> 01:41:46.170]  Go ahead.
[01:41:47.311 --> 01:42:00.281]  I wanted to let everyone know how inept our intelligence agencies are when they let a woman in from Saudi Arabia with a fake name and a fake passport.
[01:42:00.769 --> 01:42:01.710]  Yeah, by the way, you're right.
[01:42:01.770 --> 01:42:02.310]  It's on record.
[01:42:02.330 --> 01:42:04.712]  Fake name, fake passport, fake address.
[01:42:05.152 --> 01:42:08.634]  She can get in, but I get interrogated when I fly back into the U.S.
[01:42:08.714 --> 01:42:09.875]  and they know everything about me.
[01:42:10.596 --> 01:42:11.596]  Absolutely incredible.
[01:42:11.616 --> 01:42:11.936]  Go ahead.
[01:42:13.217 --> 01:42:20.062]  Tashfeen Malik is a nom-de-guerre for a Muslim jihadist from the anals of Muslim history.
[01:42:20.582 --> 01:42:29.288]  As he is known to Muslims, Tashfeen Malik al-Muhaddim in English, Tashfeen, King of the Muslims and the Conqueror of the West,
[01:42:30.049 --> 01:42:32.510]  The history stems from when you said... Hold on, stay there.
[01:42:32.530 --> 01:42:33.270]  I'm going to come back to you.
[01:42:33.310 --> 01:42:34.010]  I forgot this.
[01:42:34.050 --> 01:42:34.690]  I've heard of this.
[01:42:35.190 --> 01:42:39.772]  Oh my God, her name is a gnome to plume of a famous jihadist princess, isn't it?
[01:42:42.292 --> 01:42:43.853]  And even a female name.
[01:42:43.873 --> 01:42:44.413]  It's a man.
[01:42:44.433 --> 01:42:45.193]  It's a king.
[01:42:45.213 --> 01:42:50.815]  It's an ancient king from Muslim history who defeated Alfonso VI.
[01:42:51.696 --> 01:42:59.345]  When they were battling for Spain, which allowed the Muslims to stay in Spain for centuries, and it's symbolic of Muslim victory.
[01:42:59.385 --> 01:42:59.805]  No, you're right.
[01:42:59.845 --> 01:43:02.168]  It took the Germanic Marie Conquista to kick them out.
[01:43:03.049 --> 01:43:06.433]  I tell you, there's a mega-massive double-cross going on, and this is showing up at the top.
[01:43:06.473 --> 01:43:07.254]  I can't even believe it.
[01:43:08.797 --> 01:43:11.780]  A clean, toxic-free body is the foundation of true health.
[01:43:12.020 --> 01:43:14.162]  Deep Cleanze by InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:43:14.362 --> 01:43:21.088]  A scientifically formulated blend of nanocolloidal zeolites and organic ingredients that aid the body in cleansing chemicals and toxic metals.
[01:43:21.368 --> 01:43:26.553]  Using our proprietary multi-step extraction technology, Deep Cleanze is our most affordable all-in-one cleanser.
[01:43:26.693 --> 01:43:35.681]  With concentrated organic compounds like cilantro, milk thistle, fulvic acid, orange peel, zeolites, and others, Deep Cleanze doesn't hold back.
[01:43:36.101 --> 01:43:44.730]  Instead of buying five, six, or even seven different cleansing products, we use decades-old scientific research to put together the Rolls-Royce of all-in-one cleansing.
[01:43:44.990 --> 01:43:51.897]  Look, there's a reason Deep Cleanse is the only product on the market that uses our proprietary Spite G-Rex herbal processing technique.
[01:43:52.077 --> 01:43:57.443]  We use only the highest quality organic herbs, backed by serious research, and we still bring it to you the best way.

[01:44:08.570 --> 01:44:09.110]  I want more candy!
[01:44:09.130 --> 01:44:09.971]  I want more video games!
[01:44:10.111 --> 01:44:10.651]  Mine, mine, mine!
[01:44:11.792 --> 01:44:21.177]  And it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and help children focus.
[01:44:21.538 --> 01:44:24.159]  All of our children are hit with modern mind control.
[01:44:24.239 --> 01:44:27.581]  Television, music, fast food, GMOs, sugars, you name it.
[01:44:27.781 --> 01:44:30.523]  Young humans have not yet developed their nervous system.
[01:44:30.683 --> 01:44:33.804]  and are being hammered daily by globalist concoctions.
[01:44:34.105 --> 01:44:38.967]  It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down and then are put on dangerous psychotropic drugs.
[01:44:39.247 --> 01:44:45.430]  Working with my team we set out to find the best formula with the highest quality ingredients that children would actually like and take.
[01:44:45.630 --> 01:44:53.113]  We worked with the leading manufacturer in nutritional supplements that are safe for children to bring you the most affordable and powerful calming formula out there.
[01:44:53.373 --> 01:44:56.615]  Introducing Child Ease with herbs and calming extracts
[01:44:56.755 --> 01:45:00.643]  Like chamomile, and lemon balm, and essential nutrients that taste great.

[01:45:09.434 --> 01:45:12.657]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[01:45:12.957 --> 01:45:20.964]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[01:45:21.204 --> 01:45:26.228]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[01:45:26.628 --> 01:45:28.910]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?

[01:45:39.326 --> 01:45:40.247]  Brain Force is here.
[01:45:40.427 --> 01:45:42.548]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[01:45:42.648 --> 01:45:47.371]  You've probably noticed I've been more focused, less brain fog, more energy, and it's because of Brain Force.
[01:45:47.631 --> 01:45:50.773]  There's always hidden additives in your food, even organic food has hidden additives.
[01:45:50.914 --> 01:45:54.116]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[01:45:54.416 --> 01:45:56.097]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[01:45:56.377 --> 01:45:58.238]  It doesn't have stimulants, it doesn't have garbage in it.
[01:45:58.498 --> 01:46:00.380]  It has natural things that do it clean.
[01:46:00.480 --> 01:46:06.584]  You will find Brain Force and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[01:46:06.704 --> 01:46:09.486]  My fellow patriots, one of the things I'm most proud of
[01:46:12.308 --> 01:46:23.235]  is the fact that the InfoWars operation reaches more than 20 million people a week worldwide with the message of liberty and none of it is funded by major global corporations or by taxpayers.
[01:46:23.675 --> 01:46:25.216]  It's funded by free will.
[01:46:25.496 --> 01:46:34.822]  Listeners and viewers like you who decide to visit InfoWarsStore.com and take advantage of some of the most high-quality revolutionary products available today.
[01:46:35.142 --> 01:46:41.806]  And now, until December 18th, 2015, we are extending free shipping on top of huge discounts.
[01:46:42.126 --> 01:46:42.686]  We're good to go.
[01:47:13.274 --> 01:47:16.036]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:16.336 --> 01:47:22.859]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:47:22.959 --> 01:47:26.881]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:36.718 --> 01:47:43.961]  Tashfeen Malik is being reported by the New York Post and Associated Press was the commander, the mastermind of the 14 dead.
[01:47:46.162 --> 01:47:50.663]  This reporter's husband was hesitant and didn't take part at first and only shot a few people.
[01:47:51.524 --> 01:47:56.125]  But she, she was a proud warrior in what she did.
[01:47:57.186 --> 01:48:05.229]  She left Saudi Arabia where she had to wear a bag over her head and couldn't drive a car and leave her house to come here with all this freedom and blow Christians and Jews' heads off.
[01:48:06.277 --> 01:48:07.917]  And if you're against it, you're a racist.
[01:48:08.457 --> 01:48:09.157]  You're not trendy.
[01:48:10.138 --> 01:48:10.958]  Well, there you go.
[01:48:11.978 --> 01:48:15.819]  Now our government has turned loose hundreds of thousands of these people to murder everybody in Syria.
[01:48:16.519 --> 01:48:18.239]  And our government says it's Syria's fault.
[01:48:19.239 --> 01:48:23.780]  I'm here to tell you there's a wind on down the road where our shadows are taller than our souls.
[01:48:24.740 --> 01:48:27.001]  There's a lady we all know who shines like white.
[01:48:28.401 --> 01:48:28.841]  Crank it up.
[01:48:32.842 --> 01:48:35.442]  I tell you, my friends, this gets sicker and sicker by the minute.
[01:48:36.823 --> 01:48:38.665]  You thought the government could just sell us out forever?
[01:48:38.685 --> 01:48:39.785]  These freaks?
[01:48:40.546 --> 01:48:42.007]  They got something bigger in plan.
[01:48:42.448 --> 01:48:43.088]  It's religious.
[01:48:43.168 --> 01:48:44.269]  It's beyond Islam.
[01:48:44.810 --> 01:48:46.791]  Beyond Christianity, Judaism, any of this.
[01:48:47.692 --> 01:48:49.674]  It's about world government and conflict.
[01:48:49.754 --> 01:48:50.734]  Albert Pike wrote about it.
[01:48:51.015 --> 01:48:52.276]  A clash of civilizations.
[01:48:52.516 --> 01:48:53.637]  A giant world war.
[01:48:53.937 --> 01:48:56.139]  Turkey's attacking Russia every chance it gets right now.
[01:48:56.439 --> 01:48:57.160]  Start that war!
[01:48:58.723 --> 01:49:00.404]  Where's your football gonna be then?
[01:49:00.884 --> 01:49:03.444]  Once ICBMs and cruise vessels are hitting major cities?
[01:49:04.085 --> 01:49:09.326]  Then acting tough and strutting around all day and wearing your favorite football colors aren't gonna matter anymore.
[01:49:11.167 --> 01:49:13.267]  So, Tashfeen Malik.
[01:49:13.767 --> 01:49:15.848]  That's right, I've read about that in history.
[01:49:15.908 --> 01:49:19.149]  So, and they admit it's all a fake name and stuff, but won't say what her real name is.
[01:49:19.409 --> 01:49:23.750]  This woman has a fake jihad name, fake everything, and they let her in.
[01:49:24.090 --> 01:49:25.011]  How crazy is this?
[01:49:25.031 --> 01:49:26.071]  Go ahead and finish up, Kyle.
[01:49:27.659 --> 01:49:39.026]  Yeah, it's insane and it just, it actually kind of helps our case because it shows how blatantly obvious it is that they let a jihadi with a jihadi name into the country.
[01:49:40.629 --> 01:49:41.829]  Well, it's the Second Amendment's fault.
[01:49:41.849 --> 01:49:43.370]  The President speaks in an hour and ten minutes.
[01:49:44.050 --> 01:49:44.791]  Why be a racist?
[01:49:45.551 --> 01:49:46.451]  I appreciate your call.
[01:49:46.831 --> 01:49:49.792]  I want to race through other calls with Brandon in Missouri.
[01:49:49.832 --> 01:49:52.554]  Final comment from Joe Biggs, Douglas Scott, and others.
[01:49:52.594 --> 01:50:06.039]  But Rob Jacobson is here in studio with us and he had an idea Friday to have a contest for a meme because they're banning Christmas trees and saying don't have secret Christmas celebrations at your
[01:50:07.219 --> 01:50:08.640]  College will suspend you.
[01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:15.124]  So Rob said we ought to have a meme on Facebook and Twitter that says, hey, we're going to promote whatever we want.
[01:50:15.164 --> 01:50:26.912]  I mean, whether you like Halloween, like Christmas, like I don't know what's a Muslim holiday, Ramadan, Hanukkah, whatever the holiday is, people have a right to have it.
[01:50:26.952 --> 01:50:29.754]  And if you've got a problem with it, that means you're intolerant, mentally ill.
[01:50:29.794 --> 01:50:30.454]  You're not liberal.
[01:50:30.674 --> 01:50:32.856]  Well, now the liberals say, no, no, we ban everything.
[01:50:33.336 --> 01:50:35.257]  But whatever the most radical garbage is,
[01:50:36.314 --> 01:50:37.875]  It's just all part of an act of dominance.
[01:50:37.935 --> 01:50:39.116]  So, we have the contest.
[01:50:39.136 --> 01:50:39.237]  It's $1,000.
[01:50:39.417 --> 01:50:41.178]  We're going to pick the winner now.
[01:50:41.198 --> 01:50:41.979]  You've got to email us.
[01:50:42.399 --> 01:50:44.721]  I'll mail the $1,000 out in the next couple days to you.
[01:50:45.202 --> 01:50:50.006]  We've got another contest, Make Fun of Hillary contest, that comes up that we're going to announce next year, but those videos are coming in.
[01:50:50.306 --> 01:50:53.929]  But, Jacobson, let's go over the winner right now for TV viewers, for radio listeners.
[01:50:53.949 --> 01:50:56.451]  We just posted the article at InfoWars.com.
[01:50:56.471 --> 01:50:57.152]  We'll put it on screen.
[01:50:57.532 --> 01:51:00.355]  Showing the winner with some of the runner-ups, but everybody's a winner.
[01:51:00.695 --> 01:51:02.898]  Standing up for free speech and showing how crazy it is.
[01:51:03.219 --> 01:51:03.920]  There is the winner.
[01:51:03.940 --> 01:51:06.303]  Let's scroll down and show folks the winner and click on it.
[01:51:06.643 --> 01:51:07.484]  Come and take it.
[01:51:07.765 --> 01:51:09.227]  Describe it for radio listeners.
[01:51:09.547 --> 01:51:11.710]  Alright, well, this is the winner that we chose.
[01:51:11.790 --> 01:51:14.233]  It's the come and take it meme.
[01:51:14.754 --> 01:51:17.378]  And we liked it because it says a lot, you know.
[01:51:19.062 --> 01:51:23.909]  Reminiscent of the classic, you know, World War II, you know, the guys... Iwo Jima.
[01:51:24.069 --> 01:51:27.293]  Iwo Jima, you know, they're lifting up victory, you know.
[01:51:28.014 --> 01:51:36.666]  It's American, it really feels like InfoWars, and come and take it is something we... It celebrates not only the First Amendment here, but the Second Amendment as well.
[01:51:36.946 --> 01:51:42.272]  They're up there on a hill with just blasted off trees everywhere, dead bodies everywhere, and they're hauling up the American flag.
[01:51:42.292 --> 01:51:43.794]  Well now they're hauling up the Christmas tree.
[01:51:43.894 --> 01:51:44.335]  Exactly.
[01:51:44.355 --> 01:51:45.817]  They're really hauling up free speech.
[01:51:45.837 --> 01:51:48.500]  They're hauling up free speech because that's what's being taken from us.
[01:51:48.960 --> 01:51:50.723]  I mean, we can't even celebrate.
[01:51:50.743 --> 01:51:52.184]  We're going to have to fight for it.
[01:51:52.465 --> 01:51:52.945]  Exactly.
[01:51:53.891 --> 01:51:59.553]  The thing, I agree with you Alex, I've been listening today and the rhetoric going on in this country is unbelievable.
[01:51:59.733 --> 01:52:01.913]  It's beyond even my own imagination.
[01:52:01.933 --> 01:52:05.194]  I can't believe that people are offended by Christmas.
[01:52:05.314 --> 01:52:06.395]  It is Twilight Zone.
[01:52:06.415 --> 01:52:12.196]  Plus Christmas is a super inclusive winter festival with lights and trees and I mean give me a break man.
[01:52:12.316 --> 01:52:14.237]  As a guy who grew up in New York City,
[01:52:15.157 --> 01:52:16.479]  It's a Christmas kind of city.
[01:52:16.779 --> 01:52:18.701]  I guess everything they're going to do in New York City.
[01:52:18.821 --> 01:52:20.323]  Are you ever offended by it?
[01:52:20.343 --> 01:52:23.026]  Oh yeah, when I was a little kid, I was weeping.
[01:52:23.146 --> 01:52:24.267]  No, that's a joke.
[01:52:24.287 --> 01:52:24.888]  You liked Christmas?
[01:52:24.968 --> 01:52:25.749]  I loved Christmas.
[01:52:25.809 --> 01:52:27.090]  I mean, it was a winter thing.
[01:52:27.371 --> 01:52:28.832]  It was the winter celebration.
[01:52:29.253 --> 01:52:33.637]  When I went to New York City with my family, I mean, we went to Rockefeller Center.
[01:52:34.619 --> 01:52:36.561]  Oh, that one's good with the jihadist over the tree.
[01:52:36.581 --> 01:52:37.261]  That one was good.
[01:52:38.062 --> 01:52:41.086]  We had a lot of fun looking at all of these entries.
[01:52:41.266 --> 01:52:42.587]  Some of them are very good.
[01:52:42.627 --> 01:52:52.999]  And now folks can have fun hauling up the tree against evil again by going to Infowars.com and the story that has all these memes and posting them to your Facebook, your Twitter, and elsewhere.
[01:52:53.823 --> 01:53:03.576]  Yeah, I mean, all the entries, we got a lot of entries, and it seems that everybody's aware of the fact that free speech is absolutely essential to be expressed right now.
[01:53:04.617 --> 01:53:08.182]  If any time in history, it's time for everybody to just say what they need to, you know.
[01:53:08.783 --> 01:53:09.904]  If you like something, say it.
[01:53:09.924 --> 01:53:11.065]  If you don't like something, say it.
[01:53:11.085 --> 01:53:12.926]  It's all what this country is about.
[01:53:12.986 --> 01:53:14.588]  It's about free expression, free thought.
[01:53:15.048 --> 01:53:23.215]  Yeah, they're trying to blame, like, speech now, going, well, maybe he didn't like a Christmas tree, and there was this Jewish guy that was a Messianic Jew, and he would talk about Christ, so maybe he deserved it.
[01:53:23.255 --> 01:53:24.236]  I mean, that's in the news.
[01:53:24.256 --> 01:53:24.476]  Yeah.
[01:53:24.596 --> 01:53:27.358]  That some Jewish guy talked about Jesus, so he gets his head blown off.
[01:53:27.698 --> 01:53:28.519]  I mean, this is sick.
[01:53:28.739 --> 01:53:29.920]  But that's okay.
[01:53:30.541 --> 01:53:31.762]  Also, protected groups.
[01:53:32.382 --> 01:53:33.503]  Here we have protected groups.
[01:53:33.543 --> 01:53:42.328]  Some people are allowed to be absolutely slammed, some groups, while other groups are, oh wait a minute, you know, maybe it's not, maybe it's not jihad.
[01:53:42.628 --> 01:53:51.073]  We haven't really cleared this issue out when all the evidence points that way, when trends... When radical Islam is a scourge on Muslims and kills more Muslims than anybody.
[01:53:51.774 --> 01:53:54.835]  I don't believe that there is no such thing as non-radical Islam.
[01:53:54.916 --> 01:53:56.937]  I know there are a lot of groups that want to be left alone.
[01:53:57.137 --> 01:53:58.458]  Now some would call them apostate.
[01:53:59.318 --> 01:54:01.481]  But whatever, these are smart, hard-working people a lot of them.
[01:54:01.521 --> 01:54:02.482]  A lot of them are my friends.
[01:54:03.083 --> 01:54:04.785]  And they're the ones that are threatened by this as well.
[01:54:04.985 --> 01:54:05.426]  Exactly.
[01:54:05.446 --> 01:54:07.408]  And the reality is the reality.
[01:54:07.448 --> 01:54:13.396]  There is a presence of this historical... The reality is radical Islam does not even compete with a free society.
[01:54:13.716 --> 01:54:14.157]  Exactly.
[01:54:14.197 --> 01:54:15.399]  They have their own set of laws.
[01:54:15.439 --> 01:54:17.221]  It's like bringing cannibals in to live in your neighborhood.
[01:54:17.441 --> 01:54:22.224]  Yeah, it's a centuries-old thing, you know.
[01:54:22.244 --> 01:54:23.665]  The Dark Age craziness.
[01:54:23.965 --> 01:54:26.367]  That's been going on for centuries, and they're not done yet.
[01:54:26.487 --> 01:54:28.608]  All they do is kill each other in these radical areas.
[01:54:28.689 --> 01:54:47.161]  Exactly, and the thing is that there are, of course, there's different sections of Islam, and maybe not as radical, but there are many sections, a percentage of radical Islams, and even a percentage of such a large population on this planet represents there are going to be some people who are going to be radicalized, whereas the mainstream press
[01:54:47.921 --> 01:54:51.863]  I think nowaday is doing an amazing job at cherry-picking.
[01:54:52.023 --> 01:54:53.143]  Yeah, now we've got the winner.
[01:54:53.163 --> 01:54:54.644]  I know they sent us an email with their info.
[01:54:54.664 --> 01:54:55.784]  Do we know how to get in contact with them?
[01:54:55.824 --> 01:54:56.084]  Yes.
[01:54:57.185 --> 01:55:01.587]  The winner is, of course, that the entry we just saw.
[01:55:02.267 --> 01:55:02.967]  We contacted him.
[01:55:03.007 --> 01:55:04.728]  Mr. Travis T, come and take it.
[01:55:05.308 --> 01:55:06.949]  All right, so he's gonna win the thousand bucks.
[01:55:07.009 --> 01:55:07.429]  He got it.
[01:55:07.809 --> 01:55:08.209]  Beautiful.
[01:55:08.249 --> 01:55:08.589]  All right.
[01:55:08.629 --> 01:55:09.670]  Good job, Rob Jacobson.
[01:55:09.690 --> 01:55:10.630]  Thanks for helping with that contest.

[01:55:12.131 --> 01:55:12.471]  All right.

[01:55:20.108 --> 01:55:20.769]  I apologize.

[01:55:21.609 --> 01:55:24.331]  I'm going to get a final comment from Joe Biggs in San Bernardino.

[01:57:38.174 --> 01:57:39.535]  Contest at Infowars.com.

[01:57:41.156 --> 01:57:42.257]  Alright.
[01:57:42.838 --> 01:57:44.139]  You're an evil, evil, evil American.
