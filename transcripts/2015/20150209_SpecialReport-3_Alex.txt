[00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.081]  This is Jakari Jackson for InfoWars.com.
[00:00:11.481 --> 00:00:16.664]  Last month, the Washington State Senate said open carriers are no longer welcome in their viewing galleries.
[00:00:17.224 --> 00:00:25.148]  Lieutenant Governor Brad Owen announced that the public will no longer be able to openly carry firearms in the State Senate's Chambers public viewing area.
[00:00:25.748 --> 00:00:30.209]  We're not going to treat them any differently than everyone else, he said to Open Carry Advocates.
[00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:36.792]  Owens said that it didn't make sense to allow people to openly carry firearms while banning backpacks, signs and umbrellas.
[00:00:37.112 --> 00:00:41.933]  The last I checked, backpacks and umbrellas were not covered under the United States Constitution.
[00:00:42.353 --> 00:00:49.956]  But in response to this, Open Carry Advocates are having a rally tomorrow, the 7th, and we have gun owners prepare for arrest at Washington State Capitol.
[00:00:50.731 --> 00:00:56.597]  The Washington State Patrol is expected to arrest anyone entering the viewing chambers openly carrying a firearm.
[00:00:57.078 --> 00:01:03.084]  Although individuals with a concealed pistol license will be allowed to conceal carry weapons into the chambers.
[00:01:03.544 --> 00:01:11.532]  And of course we know in Washington State Bloomberg and Bill Gates are up there pushing their anti-gun agenda so we'll just have to wait and see how this turns out.
[00:01:12.153 --> 00:01:18.057]  And last year, you guys may also recall how Arkansas gun reigns, declaring itself to be a Muslim-free zone.
[00:01:18.497 --> 00:01:24.521]  But now, after the massacre that happened in Pakistan, Pakistani teachers are now being able to carry in the classroom.
[00:01:25.201 --> 00:01:34.888]  After 150 children and educators were killed by Taliban terrorists in a brutal massacre in December, the Pakistani government gave permission to teachers to be armed while at work.
[00:01:35.348 --> 00:01:38.390]  I'm very happy to see this, whether it's in Pakistan or here in the States.
[00:01:38.755 --> 00:01:44.477]  I think it's much better to arm the teachers than to give the kids Campbell soup cans and tell them to throw them at their attackers.
[00:01:44.937 --> 00:01:45.797]  And we'll end with this.
[00:01:46.357 --> 00:01:48.418]  Murder victim's sister on gun control group.
[00:01:48.878 --> 00:01:51.079]  Don't use her to push your agenda.
[00:01:52.339 --> 00:01:54.020]  I'm pretty averse about the bill.
[00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:55.960]  And I'm actually very against it.
[00:02:05.744 --> 00:02:12.189]  I'm very pro-gun as is Jessie, so I would really hope that you guys don't use her story for anything.
[00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:17.613]  Because the only thing that would have saved her was a gun.
[00:02:18.974 --> 00:02:19.734]  That's it for now.
