[00:00:05.393 --> 00:00:06.694]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.694 --> 00:00:08.455]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.455 --> 00:00:10.216]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.216 --> 00:00:11.797]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.797 --> 00:00:13.338]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.338 --> 00:00:17.540]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:28.966]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:28.966 --> 00:00:31.448]  There is so much to obviously cover today.
[00:00:31.448 --> 00:00:33.769]  I'm back in studio here in Austin, Texas.
[00:00:33.769 --> 00:00:34.970]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:39.792]  We have several extremely informative guests joining us.
[00:00:39.792 --> 00:00:41.713]  I'll tell you about that in the next segment.
[00:00:41.713 --> 00:00:52.219]  Obviously a few days ago we saw two police officers shot in Ferguson and the subsequent celebrations in Ferguson and New York and other major cities.
[00:00:52.219 --> 00:01:00.344]  We've also heard claims that it's even in mainstream news on Fox News that it was a false flag with no evidence is the issue.
[00:01:00.344 --> 00:01:03.766]  But the people celebrating, is that a false flag too?
[00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:09.062]  No, we don't really see any evidence of this being a staged event.
[00:01:09.062 --> 00:01:19.968]  What we see is the larger false flag of George Soros and others stirring up what they hope to be a civil war in this country that I've been warning of for years.
[00:01:19.968 --> 00:01:24.730]  And you now see it beginning to unfold because I know the globalist playbook.
[00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:26.331]  You'd have to be blind.
[00:01:26.331 --> 00:01:27.952]  You'd have to have a lobotomy.
[00:01:28.812 --> 00:01:31.474]  Not to be able to see this.
[00:01:31.474 --> 00:01:33.396]  And the public is starting to figure it out.
[00:01:33.396 --> 00:01:34.937]  We're going to break that down.
[00:01:34.937 --> 00:01:39.160]  Benjamin Netanyahu is battling for his political life.
[00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.283]  Rival party has pulled ahead in the polls.
[00:01:42.283 --> 00:01:48.128]  We're going to look at the new net neutrality power grab of the FCC.
[00:01:48.128 --> 00:01:53.812]  They finally released the 400 plus pages, not 300, as they have been saying.
[00:01:53.812 --> 00:01:54.333]  And the U.S.
[00:01:54.333 --> 00:01:57.815]  Senate committee advanced a cybersecurity bill in secret session
[00:01:58.835 --> 00:02:00.477]  Yet again.
[00:02:00.477 --> 00:02:01.157]  Yet again.
[00:02:01.157 --> 00:02:05.902]  That is just some of the news that is coming up here today.
[00:02:05.902 --> 00:02:14.571]  Obama, of course, is weighing in, trying to stir up the whole Ferguson situation because it's all he's got is diverting the population.
[00:02:14.571 --> 00:02:16.453]  We have the first lab-grown burger.
[00:02:16.453 --> 00:02:18.095]  Now a test-tube chicken is next.
[00:02:18.655 --> 00:02:19.396]  Hey, big deal.
[00:02:19.396 --> 00:02:22.621]  They use baby parts for Pepsi flavor testing.
[00:02:22.621 --> 00:02:28.068]  I mean, you're an extremist or a racist if you're not for growing baby parts inside cows.
[00:02:28.068 --> 00:02:32.494]  All this and more as we fight for human integrity, as we fight to awaken...
[00:02:33.635 --> 00:02:37.817]  The general population of the planet to the dehumanization that's taking place.
[00:02:37.817 --> 00:02:41.538]  The rise of humanity against the technocratic tyranny.
[00:02:41.538 --> 00:02:42.919]  It's all coming up today.
[00:02:42.919 --> 00:02:45.720]  Government approval rating is at an all-time low.
[00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.701]  This shows the giant is awakening.
[00:02:47.701 --> 00:02:49.121]  And here's John Bowne's report.
[00:02:49.121 --> 00:02:50.382]  We'll be back after the break.
[00:02:50.902 --> 00:02:57.567]  A major survey has revealed that American confidence in all three branches of government has reached record lows.
[00:02:57.567 --> 00:03:02.631]  The 2014 General Social Survey has mined the political climate for 40 years.
[00:03:02.631 --> 00:03:14.259]  Their studies now show that only 23% of Americans have a great deal of confidence in the Supreme Court, a meager 11% in the executive branch, and a pitifully dismal 5% in Congress.
[00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:20.441]  American confidence in the Supreme Court is reaching a record 40-year low.
[00:03:20.441 --> 00:03:23.622]  2 in 10 have zero confidence in the Supreme Court.
[00:03:23.622 --> 00:03:29.423]  Just 3% of Republicans have confidence in the President, while Democrats have dropped from 25% in 2010 to 18% in 2014.
[00:03:29.423 --> 00:03:29.823]  And Congress?
[00:03:29.823 --> 00:03:31.323]  Well, Congress is a sick joke to most Americans.
[00:03:39.285 --> 00:03:48.596]  A very, very sad day when we have to make a Hobson's choice of either funding our national security or standing for the Constitution.
[00:03:48.596 --> 00:03:59.188]  Confidence was almost non-existent, with 7% of Democrats, 5% of Independents, and 3% of Republicans with a great deal of confidence.
[00:04:00.293 --> 00:04:08.962]  First of all, any conversation I have with these senators or Senator Menendez or anyone else, I do my best to make them private.
[00:04:08.962 --> 00:04:11.665]  If that's how they're initiated, that's how they should stay.
[00:04:11.665 --> 00:04:17.391]  Senator Menendez has done a stalwart job as chair of the committee, and as far as I'm concerned, he's been an outstanding senator.
[00:04:18.292 --> 00:04:23.457]  45 years ago, 25% of Americans expressed a great deal of confidence in the press.
[00:04:23.457 --> 00:04:30.405]  Now, 7% of Americans have confidence, while 44% have no confidence at all.
[00:04:30.405 --> 00:04:33.929]  And 1 American in 10 has confidence in television.
[00:04:34.489 --> 00:04:46.995]  A recent Gallup poll named government as the number one problem in the United States, with the economy in general a close second, unemployment and jobs, immigration, health care, terrorism at six.
[00:04:46.995 --> 00:04:53.979]  America's frustration with our backdoor dealing entitled and detached elected leaders is fast approaching the breaking point.
[00:04:53.979 --> 00:04:56.040]  John Barron for InfoWars.com
[00:04:59.674 --> 00:05:05.800]  Used since before the days of the Roman Empire to support the body's natural systems and enhance overall health.
[00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:10.384]  Introducing the new Infowarslife.com oil of oregano formulation.

[00:05:34.763 --> 00:05:38.686]  You will no longer need to endure the burning of liquid oregano on the tongue.
[00:05:38.686 --> 00:05:44.891]  Wild crafted from the Mediterranean oregano species that experts agree is one of the most powerful and most challenging to acquire.
[00:05:45.291 --> 00:05:50.457]  This winter season, it's more important than ever to secure this true form of oil of oregano.
[00:05:50.457 --> 00:05:54.181]  Now available in our limited first run at Infowarslife.com.
[00:05:54.181 --> 00:05:56.084]  That's Infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:03.351]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[00:06:03.351 --> 00:06:07.633]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[00:06:07.633 --> 00:06:09.413]  Can you put two and two together?
[00:06:09.413 --> 00:06:17.276]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[00:06:17.276 --> 00:06:18.417]  But for how long?

[00:06:25.059 --> 00:06:27.860]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[00:06:29.298 --> 00:06:32.819]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[00:06:32.819 --> 00:06:41.062]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:06:41.062 --> 00:06:46.463]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[00:06:46.463 --> 00:06:49.004]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?

[00:06:59.338 --> 00:07:00.598]  Another major health threat.
[00:07:00.598 --> 00:07:05.580]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:08.261]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[00:07:08.261 --> 00:07:15.303]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[00:07:15.303 --> 00:07:18.284]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[00:07:18.284 --> 00:07:21.245]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[00:07:21.245 --> 00:07:23.265]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[00:07:23.265 --> 00:07:26.106]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[00:07:26.186 --> 00:07:31.909]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[00:07:31.909 --> 00:07:35.411]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[00:07:35.411 --> 00:07:38.513]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[00:07:38.513 --> 00:07:42.795]  The ProPure ProOne G2.0 water filtration system is a must-have.
[00:07:42.875 --> 00:07:45.036]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center.
[00:08:12.054 --> 00:08:15.377]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:35.683 --> 00:08:40.445]  Richard Belzer joins us to cover the waterfront in the third hour today.
[00:08:40.445 --> 00:08:47.329]  Best-selling author, TV movie star, a very informative guy will join us via video Skype.
[00:08:47.329 --> 00:08:53.652]  And the last time he was on, Christopher Walken popped in literally on video Skype.
[00:08:53.652 --> 00:08:54.392]  I'm not joking.
[00:08:54.392 --> 00:08:57.193]  So you never know what surprises are coming up.
[00:08:57.193 --> 00:08:59.855]  Richard Belzer has written a book with George Norrie.
[00:09:01.510 --> 00:09:03.633]  Someone is hiding something.
[00:09:03.633 --> 00:09:07.579]  What happened to Malaysian Airlines Flight 370?
[00:09:07.579 --> 00:09:10.102]  We're going to just spend part of the interview on this book.
[00:09:10.102 --> 00:09:16.532]  You could spend hours on it, but we're going to be discussing that with Richard Belzer coming up.
[00:09:18.678 --> 00:09:26.543]  In the third hour today, Dr. Edward Group is going to be joining us, as he does at least once a month, with a lot of really important health news.
[00:09:26.543 --> 00:09:35.728]  It's recently come out in mainstream news, we're going to be covering that, that glyphosate gives you five times the increased chance that's Roundup in the water supply of kidney failure.
[00:09:35.728 --> 00:09:39.710]  No wonder kidney failure is exploding all over the world where Roundup is used.
[00:09:39.710 --> 00:09:43.552]  There's a global map, it's well known in major studies, and new studies just came out.
[00:09:43.552 --> 00:09:44.813]  We're going to talk about that.
[00:09:44.813 --> 00:09:47.655]  We're going to be talking about all the new fluoride studies out of England.
[00:09:48.135 --> 00:09:50.076]  About obesity and depression.
[00:09:50.076 --> 00:09:52.537]  And I know as listeners you already know this.
[00:09:52.537 --> 00:09:55.318]  The point is, it's in the London Guardian now.
[00:09:55.318 --> 00:10:00.199]  That's the most prestigious socialist establishment organization.
[00:10:00.199 --> 00:10:02.120]  It's in the London Telegraph.
[00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:06.522]  It's in the Associated Press.
[00:10:06.522 --> 00:10:09.603]  I mean, the entire system is in deep trouble, folks.
[00:10:11.015 --> 00:10:14.597]  I mean, we've known all this since the 30s that fluoride did this.
[00:10:14.597 --> 00:10:24.864]  I've read on air, University of Texas 1934 studies about depression, thyroid failure, frying your pancreas, giving you bone cancer.
[00:10:24.864 --> 00:10:27.706]  They've known forever.
[00:10:27.706 --> 00:10:32.790]  They've known in watering operations that you don't give cows or horses tap water.
[00:10:32.790 --> 00:10:40.695]  If your wells run dry, you gotta bring in fresh water from somewhere else because it'll bioaccumulate in horses and cows and it'll kill them quick.
[00:10:42.210 --> 00:10:44.371]  You put fish in tap water, they die.
[00:10:44.371 --> 00:10:46.011]  Quick.
[00:10:46.011 --> 00:10:50.753]  Not to say it's part of the industrial revolution that we're able to have this water, but you might want to wash in it.
[00:10:50.753 --> 00:10:52.834]  You might even be able to clean your clothes in it.
[00:10:52.834 --> 00:10:55.535]  You do not want to drink it.
[00:10:55.535 --> 00:10:57.175]  But they all conspiracy theory.
[00:10:57.175 --> 00:10:58.356]  There's Newsweek.
[00:10:58.356 --> 00:11:01.837]  Water fluoridation linked to higher ADHD rates.
[00:11:01.837 --> 00:11:02.417]  You bet.
[00:11:02.417 --> 00:11:04.278]  Frying your brain.
[00:11:04.278 --> 00:11:04.558]  In fact,
[00:11:05.899 --> 00:11:09.762]  Well, you guys print me Newsweek, The Guardian, The London Telegraph, just all of them.
[00:11:09.762 --> 00:11:14.325]  I want to just sit here for TV viewers and radio listeners when group is on and just BAM!
[00:11:14.325 --> 00:11:14.905]  BAM!
[00:11:14.905 --> 00:11:15.466]  BAM!
[00:11:15.466 --> 00:11:15.766]  BAM!
[00:11:15.766 --> 00:11:19.388]  And then go into the Harvard study and it's got 25 studies listed.
[00:11:19.388 --> 00:11:20.109]  Just print those.
[00:11:20.109 --> 00:11:22.170]  I just want to throw them at the camera.
[00:11:22.170 --> 00:11:22.711]  BAM!
[00:11:22.711 --> 00:11:23.251]  BAM!
[00:11:23.251 --> 00:11:24.752]  BAM!
[00:11:24.752 --> 00:11:27.094]  Oh, you can have comics come out on HBO and
[00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:31.232]  Comedy Central and just throw in, I hate black people!
[00:11:31.232 --> 00:11:33.273]  I heard it from Alex Jones!
[00:11:33.273 --> 00:11:33.974]  I hate Jews!
[00:11:33.974 --> 00:11:34.994]  I heard it from Alex Jones!
[00:11:34.994 --> 00:11:38.057]  And slander us, it's not going to work.
[00:11:38.057 --> 00:11:40.218]  I don't like Obamacare because I'm a racist.
[00:11:40.218 --> 00:11:41.619]  I heard it from Alex Jones.
[00:11:41.619 --> 00:11:42.980]  People are getting raped by Obamacare.
[00:11:42.980 --> 00:11:43.941]  They're getting their hours cut.
[00:11:43.941 --> 00:11:45.081]  They're getting tax increases.
[00:11:45.081 --> 00:11:48.203]  So go ahead and call me a racist.
[00:11:48.203 --> 00:11:49.704]  They're learning what fluoride does.
[00:11:49.704 --> 00:11:51.766]  They're learning what GMO does.
[00:11:51.766 --> 00:11:57.430]  So of course you're desperately screaming racist, racist, racist because it's all you've got.
[00:11:58.413 --> 00:12:08.959]  While you have your federally funded white supremacist calling for my death like a tree full of parrots on a routine basis, it ain't gonna work.
[00:12:08.959 --> 00:12:12.081]  And here's the little news flash for all you guys.
[00:12:12.081 --> 00:12:16.003]  No matter what you do to me personally, the signal's been sent.
[00:12:16.003 --> 00:12:18.384]  The emergency bat signal's already been fired.
[00:12:18.384 --> 00:12:21.686]  Because here's the news, I'm not the hero in all this.
[00:12:21.686 --> 00:12:26.328]  I just fired the signal up into the clouds over the city.
[00:12:26.328 --> 00:12:26.869]  The people
[00:12:27.992 --> 00:12:29.953]  Rising are the hero.
[00:12:29.953 --> 00:12:32.914]  And I'm telling you, it's coming, it's here.
[00:12:32.914 --> 00:12:37.936]  And once the veil lifts, things can flip on a dime, and that's why the system is scared to death.
[00:12:37.936 --> 00:12:42.499]  And what do you do when the people start waking up and coming together?
[00:12:42.499 --> 00:12:47.061]  You fund radical Islamists and let them take over the Middle East, and then our troops have got to go fight them.
[00:12:47.061 --> 00:12:56.745]  And then you have the left sit around and curse our military as a bunch of murdering criminals, when all they are is being shoved in under orders into a false narrative set up by the globalists.
[00:12:58.271 --> 00:12:58.891]  What do you do?
[00:12:58.891 --> 00:13:03.755]  Well, you federalize the police, you militarize them, you train them, you set up a phony drug war.
[00:13:03.755 --> 00:13:09.518]  Then cops start getting killed at epidemic levels in the last 20 years.
[00:13:11.306 --> 00:13:13.788]  Actual shootings and killings are down the last 20.
[00:13:13.788 --> 00:13:15.870]  Cops being killed is up the last 20.
[00:13:15.870 --> 00:13:20.635]  The police then get into a fear-mongering base, start seeing the public as their enemy.
[00:13:20.635 --> 00:13:34.268]  George Soros pumps in $35 million or whatever it was, $34 million, seen different numbers, to get riots going, to fund all the white college kids showing up in black neighborhoods chanting, kill the cops.
[00:13:35.765 --> 00:13:39.032]  Then cops start getting shot in the head all over the country.
[00:13:39.032 --> 00:13:41.518]  From Florida to New York to Ferguson.
[00:13:41.518 --> 00:13:43.001]  And the answer is...
[00:13:46.693 --> 00:14:14.403]  We need more of this, according to the establishment, because it gets everyone at each other's throats, and then it will legitimize the federalization of police, which Obama signed an order on last week, totally unconstitutional, to accelerate the federalization of the police, all part of imploding the borders, coming after the guns, extra-judicially, extra-legislatively, coming after our sovereignty, they are moving on every front, grabbing the internet, you name it.
[00:14:16.081 --> 00:14:26.267]  And before the cop-killing chant started going, who was telling you five years ago that this was going to start and they were going to try to start a civil war in this country?
[00:14:26.267 --> 00:14:30.430]  It's because I have learned how the enemy has operated in other countries.
[00:14:30.430 --> 00:14:33.512]  They've done this in other countries as well.
[00:14:33.512 --> 00:14:45.639]  This is a destabilization program to degrade the sustainability and the sovereignty and the security and the prosperity and the tranquility and the peace of this country.
[00:14:46.812 --> 00:14:49.314]  And you're seeing it.
[00:14:49.314 --> 00:15:07.672]  You're seeing the socialist Chicago social engineer, the community organizer, the acorn organizer, play class warfare, ladies and gentlemen, instead of everybody of every race, color, creed, and religion coming together around private property and due process and freedom.
[00:15:08.655 --> 00:15:17.923]  I've got a stack of news articles here where cops choke a teen and brain damage him and the cop gets charged.
[00:15:17.923 --> 00:15:22.447]  I've got a stack of news articles here where bad cops or out-of-control cops are getting in trouble.
[00:15:22.447 --> 00:15:27.231]  But see, those stories never get focused on because the bad cops need to get in trouble.
[00:15:28.396 --> 00:15:42.725]  No, they always focus on some nebulous case like the Brown case or Trayvon Martin and then have the Justice Department caught in both cases behind the scenes stirring the pot.
[00:15:42.725 --> 00:15:43.986]  Stirring the pot.
[00:15:46.263 --> 00:15:55.135]  And when you get a black cop shooting somebody in their car because they have a gun, and the cop jumps the gun, scared, and shoots them, do you hear a bunch of race riot garbage?
[00:15:55.135 --> 00:15:55.596]  No.
[00:15:55.596 --> 00:15:59.521]  The Justice Department doesn't pick up on that to just attack police in general.
[00:15:59.521 --> 00:16:02.445]  They pick up on white-on-black to make it racial.
[00:16:03.146 --> 00:16:11.792]  Which then can be projected onto all white people and all black people to get us in a fight with each other when the real fight is against the globalists taking over.
[00:16:11.792 --> 00:16:14.614]  It is so elementary.
[00:16:14.614 --> 00:16:16.195]  It is so simple.
[00:16:16.195 --> 00:16:22.199]  But you can go to the comments on Infowars.com or the comments on CNN or the comments on YouTube and it's all the same.
[00:16:22.199 --> 00:16:25.642]  A bunch of people hurling racial epitaphs at each other.
[00:16:29.261 --> 00:16:31.163]  People saying, yeah, the cops deserve it.
[00:16:31.163 --> 00:16:33.024]  Time we start killing a bunch of them.
[00:16:33.024 --> 00:16:35.106]  And on the other side, oh, you blacks are gonna get it.
[00:16:35.106 --> 00:16:39.990]  Fine, we're gonna start killing you.
[00:16:39.990 --> 00:16:43.352]  See how they've now set it up to be racially based?
[00:16:43.352 --> 00:16:51.599]  Manipulating us like a bunch of idiots and the Wu-Tang Clan rapper comes out and says, you know, you reap what you sow.
[00:16:51.599 --> 00:16:52.099]  Really?
[00:16:52.099 --> 00:16:53.360]  So by that thought,
[00:16:54.546 --> 00:17:09.691]  If a black man shoots a police officer, no matter what color they are, then another random black person, because I guess they're wearing a skin color uniform, deserves to be shot.
[00:17:09.691 --> 00:17:19.915]  Because if you go and shoot a random cop, then do the cops get to come randomly shoot someone of the race that shot them, or vice versa?
[00:17:19.915 --> 00:17:22.236]  Because a bad cop might do something wrong,
[00:17:23.550 --> 00:17:32.272]  Then you're randomly going to go to some other jurisdiction, seven states away, and shoot some cop sitting in his quad car, filling out paperwork.
[00:17:32.272 --> 00:17:41.473]  I mean, that is the most ridiculous garbage, but that's collectivism, and that's the so-called multiculturalism, ultimate racism.
[00:17:41.473 --> 00:17:42.713]  See the mind game?
[00:17:42.713 --> 00:17:48.334]  They claim it's about equality, but it's not about judging people individually on what they've done.
[00:17:48.334 --> 00:17:50.735]  It's about saying whole groups are guilty.
[00:17:52.076 --> 00:17:55.578]  This is mindless tribalism.
[00:17:55.578 --> 00:18:00.760]  And while all of this is going on, U.S.
[00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:08.283]  military-concerned ISIS fighters returning to Caribbean could reach border.
[00:18:08.283 --> 00:18:13.265]  The Times of Israel has the headline, is Netanyahu about to lose the election?
[00:18:13.265 --> 00:18:21.389]  Its campaign has grown frantic, its activists are morbid, and though it would be wrong to bury the ruling Likud party, its supporters are right to be worried.
[00:18:22.361 --> 00:18:29.964]  Well, Likud will just grease whoever gets elected like happened before with Remain.
[00:18:29.964 --> 00:18:35.187]  But it is true that a lot of Israelis are sick of the Likudniks.
[00:18:35.187 --> 00:18:39.629]  So we're going to be breaking that down and following that here today.
[00:18:41.657 --> 00:18:46.901]  We do have the net neutrality regulations, and I know Paul Watson's listening.
[00:18:46.901 --> 00:18:54.906]  I know that Don Salazar, Kit Daniels, Mikhail Thelen, Kurt Nemo, and our other writers are all listening.
[00:18:54.906 --> 00:19:01.850]  I've just barely had time this morning because I just learned an hour or two ago that these came out to go over the 400 plus pages.
[00:19:01.850 --> 00:19:05.293]  It's not 300, but we've already found the key areas.
[00:19:06.192 --> 00:19:08.013]  And I'm going to cover that at the bottom of the hour.
[00:19:08.013 --> 00:19:15.796]  So for all the writers listening, I'm going to give you the subsection and where to go with this because this is really bad.
[00:19:15.796 --> 00:19:16.897]  This is really bad.
[00:19:16.897 --> 00:19:18.878]  There's a reason they waited two weeks to release this.
[00:19:20.649 --> 00:19:21.530]  Or two weeks and a day.
[00:19:21.530 --> 00:19:24.212]  It was two weeks and a day ago that they made the announcement.
[00:19:24.212 --> 00:19:25.853]  It's exactly what we thought it was.
[00:19:25.853 --> 00:19:33.139]  It is the FCC's power grab model they've had with the radio and broadcast TV, VHF, UHF.
[00:19:33.139 --> 00:19:34.420]  It's bad.
[00:19:34.420 --> 00:19:35.620]  Real bad.
[00:19:35.620 --> 00:19:37.862]  Because no one's reading the enforcement section.
[00:19:37.862 --> 00:19:42.025]  They're just reading what they claim they're going to do in these declaratory statements.
[00:19:42.025 --> 00:19:46.188]  But then, if you read deeper, there are unlimited power grab statements
[00:19:47.169 --> 00:19:53.271]  So, Katie, bar the door and get ready because the FCC is trying to eat the internet.
[00:19:53.271 --> 00:19:54.032]  It's bad.
[00:19:54.032 --> 00:19:57.953]  No wonder they tried to hide this and then leak this out on a Friday.
[00:19:57.953 --> 00:19:58.393]  We'll be back.
[00:19:58.393 --> 00:19:59.513]  Stay with us.
[00:19:59.513 --> 00:20:00.314]  I'm Mike Huckabee.
[00:20:00.314 --> 00:20:04.735]  I was the governor of Arkansas and ran for president in 2008 and I used to be a diabetic.
[00:20:04.735 --> 00:20:10.297]  One of the coolest campaigns I ever took on and won was the crusade that reversed my type 2 diabetes naturally.
[00:20:10.297 --> 00:20:13.959]  I was able to get off the medications I'd taken and I lost 110 pounds of fat in the process.
[00:20:15.419 --> 00:20:22.065]  If you or someone you care about has type 2 diabetes or prediabetes, I urge you to pay close attention to what I'm about to tell you.
[00:20:22.065 --> 00:20:28.610]  The same methods I use to reverse my type 2 diabetes are found today in the Diabetes Solution Kit from Barton Publishing.
[00:20:28.610 --> 00:20:34.636]  It's an all-natural plan that really could work for you in reversing type 2 diabetes and prevent it from coming back.
[00:20:34.636 --> 00:20:37.238]  All in as little as four weeks, with your doctor's approval.
[00:20:37.438 --> 00:20:38.118]  Stop suffering.

[00:20:59.173 --> 00:21:08.160]  Sold out for weeks due to the difficult and extensive proprietary process behind its creation, the exclusive InfoWars Life Secret 12 formulation is now back in stock.
[00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:18.087]  This ultra-clean vitamin B12 nutraceutical has been carefully crafted and developed over the last two years and is based on cellular science of how your body actively absorbs essential nutrients.
[00:21:18.647 --> 00:21:25.054]  Most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic and cannot be properly absorbed by the body.
[00:21:25.054 --> 00:21:31.461]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimedical grade bioavailable coenzyme forms of B12.
[00:21:31.461 --> 00:21:34.644]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections and
[00:21:34.844 --> 00:21:35.084]  We're good.
[00:21:59.292 --> 00:22:08.897]  As the New World Order continues to tighten its grip on every facet of our lives, we're all asking ourselves, how can we maintain our independence?
[00:22:08.897 --> 00:22:10.457]  The answer is clear.
[00:22:10.457 --> 00:22:13.058]  Get prepared and you get prepared now.
[00:22:13.058 --> 00:22:15.600]  Now the only question left is where do we begin?
[00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:18.762]  My Patreon supply is here to help.

[00:22:58.365 --> 00:22:58.605]  St.
[00:22:58.605 --> 00:23:01.366]  Paddy's Day is coming soon to Guns80.com.
[00:23:01.366 --> 00:23:06.426]  My buddy Mark is rolling in clover since Guns80.com announced its clean and green sale.
[00:23:06.426 --> 00:23:13.328]  He used his leprechaun-like magical powers to get Guns80.com to offer us a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.

[00:23:28.553 --> 00:23:31.274]  Silver has always been nature's very own antibiotic.
[00:23:31.274 --> 00:23:35.577]  And only one system allows you to generate an endless supply of natural silver solutions.
[00:23:35.577 --> 00:23:36.977]  SilverLungs.com.
[00:23:36.977 --> 00:23:39.659]  You'll find no wild claims or pseudoscience.
[00:23:39.659 --> 00:23:42.640]  Just a lifetime of nano-sized pure silver solutions.
[00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:45.001]  The Silver Lungs Generator allows you to make your own.
[00:23:45.001 --> 00:23:46.902]  So stop paying for silver solutions.
[00:23:46.902 --> 00:23:52.465]  The unique lung delivery system targets respiratory infections where other silver solutions simply cannot reach.
[00:23:52.465 --> 00:23:56.267]  See the Silver Lungs Generator and lung delivery system at SilverLungs.com.
[00:23:56.267 --> 00:23:57.768]  That's SilverLungs.com.
[00:23:59.841 --> 00:24:07.846]  No matter how hard you try, you can't stop us now!
[00:24:07.846 --> 00:24:15.992]  No matter how hard you try, you can't stop us now!
[00:24:15.992 --> 00:24:19.715]  We're the Renegades and it's atomic age!
[00:24:19.715 --> 00:24:20.995]  It's atomic age!
[00:24:20.995 --> 00:24:23.957]  We're Renegades!
[00:24:23.957 --> 00:24:28.340]  Ladies and gentlemen, during that last break I continued to read over the 400 plus pages.
[00:24:30.990 --> 00:24:37.755]  If you control F, search the document, it says enforced 295 times.
[00:24:37.755 --> 00:24:43.199]  I've got five different people reading the document and highlighting it.
[00:24:43.199 --> 00:24:47.862]  I just ran back from the back office during the break, so I just caught my breath.
[00:24:47.862 --> 00:24:49.943]  This is unbelievable.
[00:24:49.943 --> 00:24:52.825]  And we just search engined some of these terms in the news.
[00:24:52.825 --> 00:24:57.008]  No one that we know of yet is reporting what's really in this.
[00:24:57.008 --> 00:24:57.729]  Oh my gosh.
[00:24:59.448 --> 00:25:02.910]  So I've got Kit Daniels and everybody else working on this right now.
[00:25:02.910 --> 00:25:04.832]  This is really, really bad.
[00:25:04.832 --> 00:25:09.495]  I don't even have words to describe how bad this is.
[00:25:09.495 --> 00:25:16.940]  When they say that I'm reeling or my head is spinning, when you hear that term, I'm not going to talk about it right now.
[00:25:16.940 --> 00:25:20.822]  I've got to compose myself.
[00:25:20.822 --> 00:25:23.564]  This just symbolizes everything we're dealing with.
[00:25:23.564 --> 00:25:27.607]  The wanton, out-of-control power grab as the enemy moves on every front.
[00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:35.925]  They've got a Rural Affairs Commission under the Pentagon to federalize the states and all rural areas.
[00:25:35.925 --> 00:25:40.229]  They're setting up a National Stability Stabilization Police Force.
[00:25:40.229 --> 00:25:41.610]  They're federalizing the police.
[00:25:41.610 --> 00:25:46.474]  The borders have been completely lowered without even an executive order.
[00:25:46.474 --> 00:25:51.098]  They're giving the illegals free everything just to bankrupt the country.
[00:25:51.098 --> 00:25:53.900]  They're still moving forward with the ammo ban, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:25:53.900 --> 00:25:57.063]  They're just shelving it for a week or two until opposition dies down.
[00:25:58.561 --> 00:26:01.023]  They are rampaging forward on every front.
[00:26:01.023 --> 00:26:04.045]  And there is opposition to the gun grabs, so they're going to play possum.
[00:26:04.045 --> 00:26:08.508]  Which is an example of if we took action, we could actually rout these people.
[00:26:08.508 --> 00:26:11.650]  If folks understood just how much evil we're dealing with.
[00:26:11.650 --> 00:26:22.517]  And then we've got video of wellness checks, code for gun confiscation with actual video of the military trying to confiscate our guns.
[00:26:22.517 --> 00:26:23.318]  I mean, my God.
[00:26:25.734 --> 00:26:26.954]  And so many people are conditioned.
[00:26:26.954 --> 00:26:28.374]  They go, wait, I support our military.
[00:26:28.374 --> 00:26:40.216]  Alex, it's, yeah, if you support our military, make Washington stop giving them unconstitutional criminal missions that if they ever try it is going to start a civil war.
[00:26:40.216 --> 00:26:41.957]  The federal government's been seized.
[00:26:41.957 --> 00:26:53.279]  It doesn't have a blank check for foreign governments and corporations to line up and gang rape this country and our children's future.
[00:26:53.279 --> 00:26:54.819]  They are raping us with a
[00:26:56.527 --> 00:26:59.369]  Baseball bat covered in nails and glass, man.
[00:26:59.369 --> 00:27:06.174]  I mean, and I hate to use horrible analogies like that, but that isn't strong enough of an analogy.
[00:27:06.174 --> 00:27:09.976]  We are in deep trouble!
[00:27:09.976 --> 00:27:16.701]  For five years, Pepsi uses baby parts in their flavor development.
[00:27:16.701 --> 00:27:23.366]  For 20 years plus, they've been growing humanoids in cows!
[00:27:23.366 --> 00:27:23.466]  It's
[00:27:24.673 --> 00:27:25.173]  Facebook.
[00:27:25.173 --> 00:27:26.674]  In fact, I didn't see this in my stacks.
[00:27:26.674 --> 00:27:27.454]  I saw it last night.
[00:27:27.454 --> 00:27:36.736]  I went and read their terms and conditions and it was sure enough in a press release that Facebook's going to activate your microphone and your camera.
[00:27:36.736 --> 00:27:41.578]  But it said, don't worry, we have computers that aggregate the info and protect your identity.
[00:27:41.578 --> 00:27:45.259]  And then it's just put into an aggregation what you're talking about and saying in your house.
[00:27:45.259 --> 00:27:47.179]  And they just say it like it's pop and fun.
[00:27:47.179 --> 00:27:49.680]  Like, oh, hi, I'm going to drop by and slit your throat tonight.
[00:27:51.482 --> 00:27:56.664]  I mean, I want to go to people's doors, knock and say, hi, I'm here to plant microphones in your house.
[00:27:56.664 --> 00:27:57.565]  It's no big deal.
[00:27:57.565 --> 00:27:58.145]  It's fun.
[00:27:58.145 --> 00:27:59.846]  I'm wearing a pink shirt with polka dots.
[00:27:59.846 --> 00:28:06.289]  It's like if you had Jerry Lewis show up and say, hi, I'm going to, you know, beat your wife's brains out and be like, oh, sure.
[00:28:06.289 --> 00:28:07.129]  Come on in.
[00:28:07.129 --> 00:28:09.730]  You're not wearing a black uniform.
[00:28:09.730 --> 00:28:12.692]  See, the Nazis wore black uniforms to scare people made by Hugo Boss.
[00:28:14.369 --> 00:28:15.790]  Sharp uniforms.
[00:28:15.790 --> 00:28:17.970]  But they wanted to project power openly.
[00:28:17.970 --> 00:28:27.854]  Now it's, oh, hi, we're trendy, oh, oh, we're watching you and listening when you go to log into Facebook.
[00:28:27.854 --> 00:28:30.735]  I mean, it's worse than I thought.
[00:28:30.735 --> 00:28:34.176]  Twilight zone.
[00:28:34.176 --> 00:28:38.858]  I mean, the fact that George Soros would spend almost $35 million, that's mainstream niche.
[00:28:40.149 --> 00:28:41.850]  Just pull up the article for him.
[00:28:41.850 --> 00:28:44.352]  To fund the hardcore Democrat groups.
[00:28:44.352 --> 00:28:45.193]  We saw the signs.
[00:28:45.193 --> 00:28:47.395]  I said it was in the news.
[00:28:47.395 --> 00:28:48.596]  I went and looked at who was funding it.
[00:28:48.596 --> 00:28:50.857]  They said the name of groups he funds on there.
[00:28:50.857 --> 00:28:56.101]  To have people walk around and chant, deck the halls with dead cops.
[00:28:56.101 --> 00:28:59.284]  And to promote violence, basically.
[00:28:59.284 --> 00:29:00.485]  How does he get away with that?
[00:29:00.485 --> 00:29:02.987]  Because he's got a green light, people!
[00:29:04.684 --> 00:29:09.768]  George Soros funds Ferguson protests, hopes for civil action, $33 million.
[00:29:09.768 --> 00:29:13.071]  But then they dug deeper about a week later and it was like $35 million.
[00:29:13.071 --> 00:29:14.992]  And that's on the Washington Times.
[00:29:14.992 --> 00:29:18.335]  I mean, you're like, well, I am sick of the cops.
[00:29:18.335 --> 00:29:20.437]  They're where the rubber meets the road.
[00:29:20.437 --> 00:29:24.260]  So the globalists on top want to get us all fighting with each other.
[00:29:24.260 --> 00:29:25.601]  The policy's made above them.
[00:29:26.522 --> 00:29:30.563]  And you're not going to reform the police shooting them in the head.
[00:29:30.563 --> 00:29:32.843]  That is meant to prime the police state.
[00:29:32.843 --> 00:29:34.104]  Takeover!
[00:29:34.104 --> 00:29:35.804]  And with it, all our rights!
[00:29:35.804 --> 00:29:39.465]  We are sitting on top of a warehouse of TNT right now.
[00:29:39.465 --> 00:29:44.246]  And George Soros and Obama are running around with flamethrowers shooting them in the air.
[00:29:44.246 --> 00:29:46.166]  Any minute, it's going to set off, folks.
[00:29:46.166 --> 00:29:48.907]  And all hell is going to break loose.
[00:29:48.907 --> 00:29:50.307]  We're on the march.
[00:29:50.307 --> 00:29:52.847]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:52.847 --> 00:29:55.548]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:59.694 --> 00:30:09.358]  Using unparalleled research in the development of a synergistic formulation based around the key concepts of super oxygenation, the next level in cleansing is here.
[00:30:09.358 --> 00:30:19.282]  With key ingredients backed by real clinical studies, the new Oxy Powder, available through InfoWars Life, was invented during Dr. Group's research on the toxification of our bodies.
[00:30:19.282 --> 00:30:22.203]  Many herbal colon cleansers are harsh on the body.
[00:30:22.403 --> 00:30:23.024]  I think so.
[00:30:37.381 --> 00:30:37.621]  We're good.
[00:30:59.798 --> 00:31:07.001]  For all of recorded history, civilizations around the world praised the health benefits of silver.

[00:32:29.707 --> 00:32:33.369]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[00:32:33.369 --> 00:32:37.632]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[00:32:37.632 --> 00:32:39.413]  Can you put two and two together?
[00:32:39.413 --> 00:32:47.279]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[00:32:47.279 --> 00:32:48.420]  But for how long?
[00:32:48.420 --> 00:32:55.064]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com, spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[00:32:55.064 --> 00:32:57.886]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[00:33:02.432 --> 00:33:05.295]  There's a need for a new world order.
[00:33:05.295 --> 00:33:12.822]  But it has different characteristics in different parts of the world.
[00:33:12.822 --> 00:33:19.088]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:40.376 --> 00:34:07.760]  All right, let me now calmly do the best job I can, just the last few hours with my crew, go over what exactly is in the 400-plus, not 300-plus pages of the telecom, not legislation, but regulatory rules that the FCC just released two weeks after they said they would,
[00:34:09.193 --> 00:34:11.915]  And it's all written in legalese, it's all written very dry.
[00:34:11.915 --> 00:34:19.279]  I've worked in talk radio in four different radio stations physically.
[00:34:19.279 --> 00:34:29.926]  I've been on air 20 years and run my own media telecommunications organization, so I know about copyright, I know about telecom rules, I know about FCC rules.
[00:34:30.908 --> 00:34:32.829]  I know a lot about the FCC.
[00:34:32.829 --> 00:34:41.135]  I've been involved in Micro-FM, quite frankly, leading a movement to have that sprout up around the country about 18 years ago.
[00:34:41.135 --> 00:34:44.077]  And I'm just going to leave it at that.
[00:34:44.077 --> 00:34:49.761]  So I know what I'm talking about when I get into this.
[00:34:49.761 --> 00:34:53.023]  It'll take the media days to digest what's in here.
[00:34:53.023 --> 00:34:58.086]  There are a few mainstream news articles that are just saying, oh, they said they're going to protect the Internet.
[00:34:58.086 --> 00:35:00.448]  Here's the sections where they do it.
[00:35:01.744 --> 00:35:20.561]  And yes, they make some claims in there, but if you read the enforcement and the powers and the jurisdictions that they are claiming, the document 295 times says enforce.
[00:35:20.561 --> 00:35:23.804]  You can search the term penalty, fines,
[00:35:25.738 --> 00:35:27.259]  Sanctions.
[00:35:27.259 --> 00:35:30.081]  It says in here that you basically can't appeal.
[00:35:30.081 --> 00:35:36.465]  Remember, it's the FCC that you're going to be dealing with here.
[00:35:36.465 --> 00:35:37.646]  And here's what's really bad.
[00:35:37.646 --> 00:35:41.549]  It does announce as telecom the U.S.
[00:35:41.549 --> 00:35:49.494]  code subsection over cable and over internet and basically over all data transmission through the air or down lines.
[00:35:49.494 --> 00:35:53.717]  This is a total 360 takeover of all communications by the FCC.
[00:35:55.649 --> 00:36:00.870]  Says fines 24 times.
[00:36:00.870 --> 00:36:01.571]  Get ready.
[00:36:01.571 --> 00:36:04.451]  I mean, this is unbelievable.
[00:36:04.451 --> 00:36:08.593]  In fact, print me the whole document.
[00:36:08.593 --> 00:36:11.013]  I know I've just got subsections here.
[00:36:11.013 --> 00:36:11.853]  I have the whole document.
[00:36:11.853 --> 00:36:12.774]  We're tearing it apart.
[00:36:12.774 --> 00:36:14.994]  Print me a whole fresh copy, please.
[00:36:14.994 --> 00:36:16.235]  Exactly how many pages is it?
[00:36:16.235 --> 00:36:17.935]  We'll put it on screen for TV viewers.
[00:36:17.935 --> 00:36:19.596]  Radio listeners, go to InfoWars.com.
[00:36:19.596 --> 00:36:21.616]  We've got the whole document posted there.
[00:36:21.616 --> 00:36:22.916]  400 pages.
[00:36:22.916 --> 00:36:23.076]  400, exactly.
[00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:35.488]  Thank you, CJ.
[00:36:35.488 --> 00:36:51.300]  You go to Section 36 of 5 of FCC 15-24 regulations and it talks about enforcement.
[00:36:51.300 --> 00:36:52.641]  It defines enforcement.
[00:36:54.625 --> 00:37:01.548]  And it says the commission may enforce the open internet rules through investigation and processing of complaints, both formal and formal.
[00:37:01.548 --> 00:37:04.229]  This is how they do it with broadcast.
[00:37:04.229 --> 00:37:04.749]  To everything.
[00:37:04.749 --> 00:37:07.590]  I mean, they go in and define it as they've done in broadcast.
[00:37:07.590 --> 00:37:09.411]  That means complaining about speech, everything.
[00:37:09.411 --> 00:37:11.811]  I mean, this is so horrible.
[00:37:11.811 --> 00:37:13.392]  No wonder they sat on this.
[00:37:13.392 --> 00:37:19.534]  In addition, the commission may provide guidance through the use of enforcement advisories and advisory opinions.
[00:37:19.534 --> 00:37:20.995]  That means they sue you.
[00:37:20.995 --> 00:37:23.536]  And it will appoint an omnibuds person
[00:37:25.464 --> 00:37:33.971]  In order to provide the Commission with additional understanding, particularly of technical issues, the order delegates to the Enforcement Bureau, the authority, did you hear that?
[00:37:33.971 --> 00:37:51.066]  The Enforcement Bureau, it's in every state, in every major city, to request a written opinion from an outside technical organization, that means the telecoms, or other corporate groups, or otherwise to obtain objective advice from industry standards, setting bodies, or similar organizations.
[00:37:51.066 --> 00:37:52.267]  Then it goes into
[00:37:54.122 --> 00:38:07.091]  Investment with Title II to fund the power grab, how to tax you, how to regulate, how the industry has $271 billion a year, how they're planning to grab some of that.
[00:38:07.091 --> 00:38:12.755]  I mean, when you know how to read the legalese here, boy, you better watch out.
[00:38:12.755 --> 00:38:17.258]  I mean, you know how much they fine and fee and regulate and tax to have an AM or FM station?
[00:38:17.258 --> 00:38:17.898]  UHF, EHF?
[00:38:22.245 --> 00:38:32.131]  Enforcement and relationship to existing transparency rule.
[00:38:32.131 --> 00:38:43.057]  And they go on to basically create a bunch of regulations to harass anybody with any type of media organization.
[00:38:43.057 --> 00:38:49.180]  If you've got 50 customers on an email account and run some tiny local internet company in some little town, they're coming.
[00:38:51.610 --> 00:38:58.252]  On page 120, you've got 272.
[00:38:58.252 --> 00:39:11.397]  For informal complaints and investigations, the Enforcement Bureau efforts will continue to be informed by resolutions or formal complaints and will also continue to be informed by the standards developed by existing multi-stakeholder.
[00:39:11.397 --> 00:39:13.457]  That means the globalist companies.
[00:39:13.457 --> 00:39:14.698]  Industry and consumer groups.
[00:39:15.506 --> 00:39:17.627]  That means all the leftist consumer groups.
[00:39:17.627 --> 00:39:19.887]  See, they'll have a vote on what's done, not you.
[00:39:19.887 --> 00:39:22.268]  The Enforcement Bureau will also work.
[00:39:22.268 --> 00:39:26.269]  See, when a bunch of George Soros NGOs complain, oh, they're coming.
[00:39:26.269 --> 00:39:30.691]  The Enforcement Bureau, that's why George Soros funded 196 mil to get this in.
[00:39:30.691 --> 00:39:34.352]  It's always the same guy, I'm not demonizing him, it's just always him.
[00:39:34.352 --> 00:39:36.273]  Want to riot and shoot the cops?
[00:39:36.273 --> 00:39:37.413]  George Soros.
[00:39:37.413 --> 00:39:38.193]  Want world government?
[00:39:38.193 --> 00:39:38.973]  Want to turn the guns in?
[00:39:38.973 --> 00:39:39.454]  George Soros.
[00:39:39.454 --> 00:39:40.514]  Want to shut down Alex Jones?
[00:39:40.514 --> 00:39:41.334]  George Soros.
[00:39:41.334 --> 00:39:42.655]  Want to fund the internet takeover?
[00:39:42.655 --> 00:39:43.215]  George Soros.
[00:39:44.073 --> 00:39:45.294]  Want to find a Russian war?
[00:39:45.294 --> 00:39:45.974]  George Soros.
[00:39:45.974 --> 00:39:55.302]  I mean, it's just, the guy's probably smells like sulfur or something, and the guy's like Beelzebub in a red, red pajamas.
[00:39:55.302 --> 00:39:58.104]  Man, it's a joke.
[00:39:58.104 --> 00:40:03.488]  A literal Nazi collaborator, and he's running around in the open screwing the country over.
[00:40:03.488 --> 00:40:12.695]  The Enforcement Bureau will also work with interested parties on an informal basis, I mean secretly with informants, to identify ways to promote compliance with the open internet rules.
[00:40:14.071 --> 00:40:17.452]  Oh, promote compliance, and then they go into that, lawsuits, you name it.
[00:40:17.452 --> 00:40:25.834]  Legal authority, and this is where you go then find, under this title, lawsuits, fines, regulations.
[00:40:25.834 --> 00:40:31.055]  We ground the open internet rules we adopt today in multiple sources of legal authority.
[00:40:31.055 --> 00:40:34.616]  Section 706, Title 2, Title 3 of the Telecommunications Act.
[00:40:34.616 --> 00:40:35.636]  We're going to go to that in a moment.
[00:40:36.823 --> 00:40:41.228]  We marshal all of these sources of authority towards a common statutory supported goal.
[00:40:41.228 --> 00:40:55.065]  They're creating a new mega law to protect or a new uniform commercial code to protect and promote internet openness as a platform of competition, free expression, innovation, a driver of economic growth, and an engine of virtuous cycle of broadband.
[00:40:55.666 --> 00:41:00.029]  Deployment, but we know how they've always really acted, and we know Obama and Soros are for it.
[00:41:00.029 --> 00:41:02.351]  Doesn't matter what they claim they're doing.
[00:41:02.351 --> 00:41:03.632]  Give me the keys to your house.
[00:41:03.632 --> 00:41:03.912]  Why?
[00:41:03.912 --> 00:41:06.814]  Because I want to come and kiss you at night and pat you on the head.
[00:41:06.814 --> 00:41:07.735]  Well, you know what?
[00:41:07.735 --> 00:41:10.737]  No thank you.
[00:41:10.737 --> 00:41:24.227]  274, we therefore invoke multiple complementary sources of legal authority, as a number of parties point out, over authority under Section 706 is not mutually exclusive with our authority under.
[00:41:25.134 --> 00:41:27.876]  So they're just saying basically we can do anything we want.
[00:41:27.876 --> 00:41:29.977]  Titles 2 and 3 of the Act.
[00:41:29.977 --> 00:41:31.918]  So they're saying we've got more power than that.
[00:41:31.918 --> 00:41:38.582]  Rather, we read our statute to provide several alternative sources of authority that work in concrete towards common ends.
[00:41:38.582 --> 00:41:47.548]  As described below under Section 706, the Commission has the authority to adopt these open internet rules to encouraging and accelerate the deployment of broadband to all Americans.
[00:41:47.548 --> 00:41:49.068]  And that's what they announced five years ago.
[00:41:49.068 --> 00:41:50.349]  Remember Obama?
[00:41:52.130 --> 00:41:55.732]  Feds to provide free broadband to all!
[00:41:55.732 --> 00:41:58.294]  You deserve it like a chicken in every pot!
[00:41:58.294 --> 00:42:08.560]  Then they'll bring their regulatory control, they'll undercut industry, they'll put their messages over it and branding, and they will certainly give preferential treatment in Europe.
[00:42:08.560 --> 00:42:14.784]  Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com is already banned in most train stations, libraries, you've seen the news articles.
[00:42:15.672 --> 00:42:17.457]  So, that's where this is going.
[00:42:17.457 --> 00:42:22.932]  This is Internet 2 from the government with select corporations branding it a safe Internet, which they're going to tax.
[00:42:25.197 --> 00:42:33.361]  Section 706 and B each provide an express affirmative grant of authority to the Commission, and the rules we adopt today fall well within their scope.
[00:42:33.361 --> 00:42:40.203]  So this is, they're basically saying, the power we have over broadcast, we now have over cable, telecoms, and all internet transmissions.
[00:42:40.203 --> 00:42:43.105]  I mean, that is huge!
[00:42:43.105 --> 00:42:53.008]  This isn't, we're going to sue somebody if they go in and don't let certain websites have their information over it.
[00:42:53.008 --> 00:42:54.029]  No, no, that's already going on.
[00:42:55.467 --> 00:43:06.094]  It's saying we're going to take it over and provide it for free to everybody and make... I mean, this is so scary.
[00:43:06.094 --> 00:43:06.614]  Listen to this.
[00:43:06.614 --> 00:43:09.176]  This is their declaratory statement.
[00:43:09.176 --> 00:43:11.837]  47 U.S.C.
[00:43:11.837 --> 00:43:19.522]  1302A, section 706A, provides in full, the commission, each state commission, that's the state, local, group.
[00:43:19.522 --> 00:43:20.183]  Ooh, boy.
[00:43:21.479 --> 00:43:28.649]  Remember when they opened up broadband on AM, FM, digital, where you could have hundreds of local stations if you wanted?
[00:43:28.649 --> 00:43:36.880]  And they gave them basically to nobody local, but they'll give one channel of hundreds of new ones to some socialist group or some La Reconquista Open Borders group.
[00:43:36.880 --> 00:43:37.721]  That's what they've done in Austin.
[00:43:37.721 --> 00:43:38.862]  They've been given actually two channels.
[00:43:39.790 --> 00:43:46.153]  So the most anti-gun, vile garbage gets a FM channel, but nobody else does.
[00:43:46.153 --> 00:43:48.455]  And then all these commercial interests get it.
[00:43:48.455 --> 00:43:49.255]  See?
[00:43:49.255 --> 00:43:54.218]  So it's not even truly socialist, where they just hand it out randomly to groups, so there's a lottery.
[00:43:54.218 --> 00:43:55.358]  No.
[00:43:55.358 --> 00:43:59.741]  All the little pet groups get to take over the media.
[00:43:59.741 --> 00:44:01.462]  Man, this is bad.
[00:44:01.462 --> 00:44:07.425]  The Commission, each state commission, with regulatory jurisdiction over telecommunications services, shall encourage the deployment
[00:44:08.689 --> 00:44:14.193]  Of a reasonable and timely basis of advanced telecommunications capability to all Americans.
[00:44:14.193 --> 00:44:17.215]  See, they will decide who gets it.
[00:44:17.215 --> 00:44:27.922]  Not the market, including in particular elementary and secondary schools and classrooms by utilizing in a manner consistent with the public interest, convenience and necessity, price cap regulation.
[00:44:27.922 --> 00:44:29.243]  Price cap!
[00:44:29.243 --> 00:44:31.044]  Oh my gosh!
[00:44:31.044 --> 00:44:32.785]  That's Nixonian.
[00:44:32.785 --> 00:44:34.066]  Or Soviet.
[00:44:34.066 --> 00:44:35.687]  But Nixon did do that as well.
[00:44:35.687 --> 00:44:36.448]  That's why it sounds weird.
[00:44:36.448 --> 00:44:37.429]  Soviet and Nixonian?
[00:44:37.429 --> 00:44:37.549]  Yeah.
[00:44:39.113 --> 00:44:40.134]  Price cap!
[00:44:40.134 --> 00:44:43.416]  They actually use the word price cap!
[00:44:43.416 --> 00:44:48.439]  Regulatory forbearance, measures that promote competition.
[00:44:48.439 --> 00:44:51.321]  I love how they say price caps competition.
[00:44:51.321 --> 00:44:57.885]  In a local telecommunications market or other regulating methods that remove barriers infrastructure investment.
[00:44:57.885 --> 00:45:00.467]  Well that's antitrust and that's Congress not the FCC.
[00:45:02.788 --> 00:45:06.169]  Oh my gosh, folks, this just gets worse.
[00:45:06.169 --> 00:45:11.471]  281 of page 123, the open internet rules fall well within the scope of our section 706 authority.
[00:45:11.471 --> 00:45:16.973]  So they now basically claim broadcast control over everything.
[00:45:16.973 --> 00:45:25.256]  So, what they've done with broadcast, they're gonna do with the internet, and they're gonna create a quote, utility that's free.
[00:45:25.256 --> 00:45:26.617]  Well, your electricity's not free.
[00:45:30.540 --> 00:45:40.569]  Your gas isn't free, but they're saying this is free, which is going to be giant giveaways to the big telecoms that play ball, just like the Obama phone scam.
[00:45:40.569 --> 00:45:46.754]  So the FCC within it has so many frauds, but that's another headline right off that subsection.
[00:45:48.072 --> 00:45:53.116]  FCC to provide free internet like ObamaPhone as political payoff.
[00:45:53.116 --> 00:45:56.478]  I mean, UNBELIEVABLE!
[00:45:56.478 --> 00:46:08.087]  And then Carlos Swim has made, last number I saw in the Wall Street Journal, he owns part of the New York Times, was something like $4 billion off the ObamaPhone?
[00:46:08.087 --> 00:46:12.130]  We didn't even give it to an American company to make the billions of dollars?
[00:46:13.268 --> 00:46:25.222]  Off the boondoggle of the free Obama phones, $4 billion to the Mexican kingpin involved in everything you can imagine?
[00:46:25.222 --> 00:46:28.726]  Oh my God, folks, I've only gotten into one small area of this.
[00:46:28.726 --> 00:46:30.829]  I mean, this is just unbelievable.
[00:46:30.829 --> 00:46:32.391]  But what is the media running with?
[00:46:35.117 --> 00:46:40.000]  The media I'm going to get to in a moment is, the controlled media, is with what they say they're doing this for.
[00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:44.923]  Because Obamacare is going to give you something free and we're going to take your guns, protect the children.
[00:46:44.923 --> 00:46:49.386]  It's got all these statements of intent, which as we know means nothing.
[00:46:49.386 --> 00:46:56.511]  What matters is what they actually announce in the teeth of the enforcement and what they claim the powers they have.
[00:46:56.511 --> 00:46:59.433]  E. Enforcement of the Open Internet Rules.
[00:46:59.433 --> 00:46:59.913]  Background.
[00:47:01.394 --> 00:47:03.435]  And they go into how they're going to enforce.
[00:47:03.435 --> 00:47:10.339]  They're going to hear from consumers, that's the socialists that complain, and stakeholders, that's the big companies.
[00:47:10.339 --> 00:47:27.328]  And then, they write down how they will do it with lawsuits and other mechanisms that they've used under, then they mention the subsections they've used in broadcast, which is armed raids, arrests, fines, fees, I mean, get ready, the FCC.
[00:47:27.328 --> 00:47:28.449]  I was on a tiny ferry.
[00:47:30.353 --> 00:47:33.034]  First, I saw him on big ferries this weekend down in Port Aransas.
[00:47:33.034 --> 00:47:36.715]  A ferry that goes about 200 yards, 300 yards across there at Aransas Pass.
[00:47:36.715 --> 00:47:39.256]  And they had a TSA guy bugging his eyes out on people.
[00:47:39.256 --> 00:47:42.817]  When you're going across, it takes 60 seconds.
[00:47:42.817 --> 00:47:43.798]  And it was TSA.
[00:47:45.089 --> 00:47:49.831]  And if you try to go to Galveston at the ferry, they search every car that comes through and check under the hood and everywhere.
[00:47:49.831 --> 00:47:52.732]  But the border stays wide open and they fund ISIS.
[00:47:52.732 --> 00:47:54.832]  It's nothing but internal checkpoints.
[00:47:54.832 --> 00:47:59.474]  I mean, I'm just showing how the TSA is taking over everywhere now as well.
[00:47:59.474 --> 00:48:03.935]  I mean, it is just a federal power grab.
[00:48:03.935 --> 00:48:06.916]  Page 105.
[00:48:06.916 --> 00:48:10.617]  Designing an effective enforcement process.
[00:48:10.617 --> 00:48:11.758]  And then it goes through
[00:48:13.868 --> 00:48:22.574]  How they will establish Department of Justice referrals for Department of Justice visits.
[00:48:22.574 --> 00:48:25.096]  That's in 228.
[00:48:25.096 --> 00:48:29.259]  And how they will also use the state bureaus of the FCC under existing code.
[00:48:29.259 --> 00:48:37.224]  And when you read the existing code, it is, in some cases, armed FCC agents.
[00:48:37.224 --> 00:48:40.867]  And they've got stuff in here about, oh, open to the blind or the deaf.
[00:48:40.867 --> 00:48:42.168]  So now if you have a tiny website,
[00:48:43.089 --> 00:48:47.711]  And you don't sign up to Google or whatever to then provide translation?
[00:48:47.711 --> 00:48:49.192]  Oh, now they're going to come shut you down.
[00:48:49.192 --> 00:48:50.372]  And they've been talking about that forever.
[00:48:50.372 --> 00:48:55.914]  I mean, this is just a... I just don't even have words at this point.
[00:48:55.914 --> 00:49:01.356]  I mean, this is just exactly what we thought it would be and more.
[00:49:01.356 --> 00:49:12.061]  They say you can find requests for advisory opinions to follow this via Commission's website or with Office of the Secretary and must be copied to the Commission's staff.
[00:49:15.191 --> 00:49:17.912]  So it's the same thing.
[00:49:17.912 --> 00:49:19.533]  This is so out of control.
[00:49:19.533 --> 00:49:23.155]  Oh, here's the best part.
[00:49:23.155 --> 00:49:28.918]  The Enforcement Bureau will have discretion to choose whether it will respond or request to their actions.
[00:49:28.918 --> 00:49:35.481]  So, you know, they may sue you or shut you down or SWAT team raid you and then you just, they may not even talk to you.
[00:49:35.481 --> 00:49:37.042]  That really sounds like freedom, doesn't it?
[00:49:37.042 --> 00:49:39.023]  Boy, thanks for saving the Internet, Obama!
[00:49:40.943 --> 00:49:43.725]  234 of 107.
[00:49:43.725 --> 00:49:55.551]  Although the Enforcement Bureau will attempt to respond to requests for advisory opinions expeditiously, we decline to establish any firm deadlines to rule on them or issue a response.
[00:49:55.551 --> 00:49:56.532]  Talk to the hand!
[00:49:58.826 --> 00:50:03.930]  It's an Obama phone scam to the big telecoms at the top and to the minions at the bottom.
[00:50:03.930 --> 00:50:05.852]  It's a total power grab.
[00:50:05.852 --> 00:50:09.175]  It's just unbelievable.
[00:50:09.175 --> 00:50:26.129]  But don't worry, in appendix, final rules, they just have some statements about 8.5, no blocking, 8.7, no throttling, 8.9, no paid prioritization.
[00:50:26.129 --> 00:50:27.210]  I guess that's where you
[00:50:30.114 --> 00:50:36.256]  You know, pay to have your stuff pushed out more, and they're actually saying that may stop Google Ads.
[00:50:36.256 --> 00:50:40.237]  Because you pay there to get your ad promoted more, but that's just how it works.
[00:50:40.237 --> 00:50:48.380]  And there's a bunch of lawsuits getting readied over this, and it'll just become a big battle of paying off politicians to decide how it ends up regulatorily being set up.
[00:50:48.380 --> 00:50:51.481]  And so it's just putting the internet up on the chopping block is what this is doing.
[00:50:51.481 --> 00:50:58.643]  There'll be a huge fight, billions will be spent on lawyers by all sides, and in the end the telecoms will come in and take over the internet as they planned in the beginning.
[00:50:59.554 --> 00:51:00.394]  Harvest Right.
[00:51:00.394 --> 00:51:06.437]  The makers of the only in-home freeze dryer would like to present to you their greenhouses that double as emergency shelters.

[00:51:09.538 --> 00:51:11.999]  As a greenhouse, it will stand for decades.
[00:51:11.999 --> 00:51:16.862]  It's incredibly strong, long-lasting, and it can be quickly put up or taken down.
[00:51:16.862 --> 00:51:19.783]  It is also ideal when used as an emergency shelter.

[00:51:29.247 --> 00:51:31.148]  By now, you've heard about Bitcoins.
[00:51:31.148 --> 00:51:34.611]  But did you know that over 65,000 businesses accept Bitcoins?
[00:51:34.611 --> 00:51:40.895]  Listen, if you're already earning Bitcoins or trying to make money in the Bitcoin market, you've gotta know BidBit.co.

[00:51:58.906 --> 00:52:00.827]  It's very easy to be a criminal.
[00:52:00.827 --> 00:52:04.467]  All you need to burglarize a home is one simple household tool.
[00:52:04.467 --> 00:52:05.828]  A pair of scissors.
[00:52:05.828 --> 00:52:11.609]  If your home security system can be compromised by a criminal using scissors, then you're making it easy for him.
[00:52:11.609 --> 00:52:16.530]  Almost every home security system, even those sold by big-name companies, has a weakness.
[00:52:16.530 --> 00:52:17.511]  The phone line.
[00:52:17.511 --> 00:52:22.772]  You shell out $1,500, get locked into a long-term contract, and think you're safe.
[00:52:22.772 --> 00:52:26.513]  But a burglar can destroy your alarm in seconds with one snip.
[00:52:26.673 --> 00:52:29.994]  And when a burglar cuts your phone line, you're defenseless.
[00:52:29.994 --> 00:52:32.455]  SimpliSafe Home Security is the smarter choice.

[00:52:58.973 --> 00:52:59.974]  Hey, Boomer!
[00:52:59.974 --> 00:53:03.416]  I learned in school today that 60% of our bodies are made of water.
[00:53:03.416 --> 00:53:05.078]  Good thing we have the Berkey System.
[00:53:05.078 --> 00:53:07.039]  It's the cleanest, best water ever.
[00:53:07.039 --> 00:53:12.883]  Mom says it's because the Berkey's filtration system cleans out the bad stuff and leaves only pure, delicious water.
[00:53:12.883 --> 00:53:13.703]  I know, right?
[00:53:13.703 --> 00:53:15.024]  You love it too!
[00:53:15.024 --> 00:53:16.465]  Yeah, I'm thirsty too.

[00:54:05.743 --> 00:54:08.324]  Every morning at the mine you could see him arrive.
[00:54:08.324 --> 00:54:10.724]  He stood six foot six and weighed 245.
[00:54:10.724 --> 00:54:14.065]  Kind of broad at the shoulder and narrow at the hip.
[00:54:14.065 --> 00:54:19.146]  And everybody knew he didn't give no lift to Big John.
[00:54:19.146 --> 00:54:21.906]  Big John.
[00:54:21.906 --> 00:54:24.727]  Big John.
[00:54:24.727 --> 00:54:27.627]  Big Bad John.
[00:54:27.627 --> 00:54:28.668]  Big John.
[00:54:30.797 --> 00:54:33.463]  Nobody seemed to know where John called home.
[00:54:33.463 --> 00:54:36.208]  He just drifted into town and stayed all alone.
[00:54:36.208 --> 00:54:40.617]  Didn't say much, kinda quiet and shy, but he spoke it all.
[00:54:40.617 --> 00:54:42.500]  He just said hi to Big John.
[00:54:44.653 --> 00:54:56.563]  Somebody said he came from New Orleans where he got in a fight over a Cajun queen and a crashing blow from a huge right hand sent a Louisiana fella to the promised land, Big John.
[00:54:56.563 --> 00:55:01.748]  I never sent anybody to the promised land with my fists.
[00:55:01.748 --> 00:55:06.532]  You know, I'd like to send tyranny to its watery grave with Davy Jones.
[00:55:10.439 --> 00:55:13.462]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:55:13.462 --> 00:55:13.962]  to 2 p.m.
[00:55:13.962 --> 00:55:15.263]  we're here live.
[00:55:15.263 --> 00:55:32.940]  There's a reason on a daily basis they have comics, TV hosts, media demonize this broadcast and yours truly because they're demonizing Alex Jones as a figurehead of the libertarian liberty movement that is a thousand light years more liberal
[00:55:33.666 --> 00:55:40.434]  Than the fascistic control freak totalitarians that call themselves the trendies.
[00:55:40.434 --> 00:55:43.137]  That call themselves the hipsters.
[00:55:43.137 --> 00:55:47.882]  They're the idiot moron followers of the globalists.
[00:55:47.882 --> 00:55:49.644]  Who want their free Obamacare.
[00:55:49.644 --> 00:55:50.985]  And who want their free broadband.
[00:55:50.985 --> 00:55:53.128]  And who want the FCC to save the internet.
[00:55:54.175 --> 00:56:04.837]  The FCC works for the big corporations, and they help consolidate media down to four companies, and they always have, and they always will, and the big corporations couldn't get it done.
[00:56:04.837 --> 00:56:12.319]  So they had the FCC come in like it was going to save it, and now they're going to have a two-three year battle and carve it up.
[00:56:12.319 --> 00:56:15.420]  But we've got a public with an attention span of about six and a half minutes.
[00:56:15.420 --> 00:56:17.760]  It used to be about 15, 20 years ago.
[00:56:17.760 --> 00:56:20.621]  Soon they're talking about attention spans being a minute long.
[00:56:21.860 --> 00:56:28.062]  So those of us that have long attention spans, those of us that are into facts, we're the enemy.
[00:56:28.062 --> 00:56:38.285]  We sit there and watch CNN or MSNBC or the Comedy Central or HBO, just in the middle of a movie or in the middle of a comedy show, go, you know Alex Jones hates Jews and blacks!
[00:56:38.285 --> 00:56:39.986]  Yeah, Alex Jones the radio host, uh-huh!
[00:56:40.700 --> 00:56:41.421]  Next show.
[00:56:41.421 --> 00:56:43.363]  You know Alex Jones wants to blow things up.
[00:56:43.363 --> 00:56:45.386]  You know Alex Jones is worse than ISIS.
[00:56:45.386 --> 00:56:46.627]  You know Alex Jones hates women.
[00:56:46.627 --> 00:56:47.768]  Bill O'Reilly.
[00:56:47.768 --> 00:56:50.632]  And tonight we look at internet stalking of women and sex predators.
[00:56:50.632 --> 00:56:52.314]  Cuts to a picture of me and my face turns red.
[00:57:00.595 --> 00:57:03.978]  No evidence, no proof, no claims, just sex predators.
[00:57:03.978 --> 00:57:05.179]  Here's Alex Jones.
[00:57:05.179 --> 00:57:07.100]  That's called subliminal in plain view.
[00:57:07.100 --> 00:57:09.462]  That's how dumb they think we are.
[00:57:09.462 --> 00:57:13.666]  Well, we're not that dumb, but to a jellyfish TV viewer who has an attention span of about six minutes...
[00:57:14.520 --> 00:57:16.441]  They're not paying attention once they get into that show.
[00:57:16.441 --> 00:57:20.902]  They go into suspended disbelief, they veg out, and then they just go, Alex Jones!
[00:57:20.902 --> 00:57:24.683]  The subconscious just accepts, Alex Jones hurt women!
[00:57:24.683 --> 00:57:26.664]  Alex Jones hurt blacks!
[00:57:26.664 --> 00:57:33.006]  Alex Jones... I mean, we're talking warfare, folks!
[00:57:33.006 --> 00:57:35.206]  So, it's a fight.
[00:57:35.206 --> 00:57:38.767]  And they know that we're starting to trigger the grassroots, and they're scared of you.
[00:57:38.767 --> 00:57:40.488]  So their attack on me is an attack on you.
[00:57:40.488 --> 00:57:43.309]  That's why I built a bigger organization.
[00:57:44.312 --> 00:57:48.234]  We intend to continue this operation even if they imprison me or bust a cap in my head, whatever.
[00:57:48.234 --> 00:57:51.275]  I don't want to die, but send me on a long vacation.
[00:57:51.275 --> 00:57:53.216]  I ain't worried about it.
[00:57:53.216 --> 00:57:54.717]  I was born a man.
[00:57:54.717 --> 00:57:56.277]  I was born to fight.
[00:57:56.277 --> 00:57:59.939]  I was born to not cower down in the dirt and be conned all day.
[00:57:59.939 --> 00:58:02.280]  And that's all that matters is I'll never be your slave.
[00:58:02.280 --> 00:58:04.141]  You'll never control my mind or my soul.
[00:58:04.141 --> 00:58:06.022]  So lie all you want, cowards.
[00:58:06.022 --> 00:58:10.924]  Thank God I was never part of your scumbag sellout spirit.
[00:58:11.764 --> 00:58:13.645]  Praise the Lord!
[00:58:13.645 --> 00:58:17.106]  People say, man, why are you sounding like Billy Graham on the show more and more here?
[00:58:17.106 --> 00:58:17.826]  Well, you know what?
[00:58:17.826 --> 00:58:22.627]  When you get this deep into this stuff, you just get closer to God, and I can't help it.
[00:58:22.627 --> 00:58:26.009]  I don't get up here and inject God into things because it's some tactic.
[00:58:26.009 --> 00:58:26.969]  I just want to say it!
[00:58:28.097 --> 00:58:30.980]  Because that's who I'm with, you go ahead and be who you're with.
[00:58:30.980 --> 00:58:33.422]  They want to shut this show down, what are you going to do?
[00:58:33.422 --> 00:58:34.824]  Spread the word!
[00:58:34.824 --> 00:58:37.266]  We have people calling all over the country, including billboard companies.
[00:58:37.266 --> 00:58:39.309]  They're putting our billboards up everywhere, for free.
[00:58:39.309 --> 00:58:41.211]  God bless you, we salute you.
[00:58:41.211 --> 00:58:43.493]  From New York to Oregon!
[00:58:43.493 --> 00:58:44.434]  It's happening!
[00:58:44.434 --> 00:58:45.415]  Temple to Spare!
[00:58:45.415 --> 00:58:45.595]  I'm ready!
[00:58:49.836 --> 00:58:50.836]  Alex Jones here.
[00:58:50.836 --> 00:58:59.980]  For the last two years, I've been working with top doctors, nutritionists, and chemists to design a nutraceutical formulation that has truly life-changing health benefits.
[00:58:59.980 --> 00:59:05.222]  So many other formulations out there contain toxic ingredients, synthetic additives, and even GMOs.
[00:59:05.542 --> 00:59:09.265]  Introducing the all-new Ancient Defense Herbal Immunity Blend.
[00:59:09.265 --> 00:59:18.832]  Crafted with over 14 key ancient herbs and extracts to supercharge and prepare your body for what experts admit is the most dangerous season of the year.
[00:59:18.832 --> 00:59:30.241]  We have rejected hundreds of other formulations in our quest to bring you what is simply the most powerful and comprehensive proprietary formula that we have ever created in the realm of herbal immunity.
[00:59:30.241 --> 00:59:35.005]  Experience the benefits of combining over 14 ancient herbs and extracts
[00:59:35.225 --> 00:59:36.986]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:00:05.492 --> 01:00:06.812]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.812 --> 01:00:08.573]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.573 --> 01:00:10.333]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:10.333 --> 01:00:11.914]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.914 --> 01:00:13.474]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.474 --> 01:00:17.655]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.655 --> 01:00:21.716]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:36.354 --> 01:00:45.117]  Alright ladies and gentlemen, coming up interspersed for the next two hours, I'm going to recap in a basic boil down.
[01:00:45.117 --> 01:00:47.418]  We're doing articles right now.
[01:00:47.418 --> 01:00:51.519]  The FCC has gobbled up the internet.
[01:00:51.519 --> 01:01:00.382]  They're claiming they're going to use broadcast rules and Justice Department and local enforcement through their federal bureaus at the state level to power grab.
[01:01:00.382 --> 01:01:02.743]  The only other outlet that's reporting on any of this is RT.
[01:01:05.177 --> 01:01:05.397]  I don't
[01:01:24.787 --> 01:01:27.890]  We need to get interns in here to help us well on video.
[01:01:27.890 --> 01:01:29.452]  Get ones that are trained on that.
[01:01:29.452 --> 01:01:30.733]  We've got some great interns now.
[01:01:30.733 --> 01:01:38.961]  We need to just start grabbing stuff during the show live that's key intel, and then putting that out as little pieces, and then put the whole out later.
[01:01:38.961 --> 01:01:41.083]  That's something that needs to be implemented immediately.
[01:01:41.083 --> 01:01:44.146]  We've got to increase output in the face of the globalists.
[01:01:47.065 --> 01:01:53.607]  You notice they're power grabbing everything and trying to start race wars and mix anti-police garbage into it.
[01:01:53.607 --> 01:02:02.031]  And again, I'm the guy constantly criticizing the federalization and corruption of the police, but that is not criticizing the police.
[01:02:02.031 --> 01:02:04.892]  They want to turn us into a third world country.
[01:02:04.892 --> 01:02:07.173]  See, that's how they work.
[01:02:07.173 --> 01:02:08.513]  You're anti-government.
[01:02:08.513 --> 01:02:10.374]  You don't want the government to trample the Constitution.
[01:02:11.209 --> 01:02:13.630]  No, I'm anti-unconstitutional government.
[01:02:13.630 --> 01:02:15.311]  I'm anti-big government.
[01:02:15.311 --> 01:02:25.555]  And when George Soros and Barack Obama are publicly funding groups out basically calling for violence against police to stir up clashes in a civil war, yeah, I'm against it.
[01:02:25.555 --> 01:02:28.036]  If George Soros is for taking guns, I'm against it.
[01:02:28.036 --> 01:02:30.737]  If George Soros is for rioting with police, I'm against it.
[01:02:30.737 --> 01:02:32.918]  If George Soros is for open borders, I'm against it.
[01:02:32.918 --> 01:02:35.579]  If he's for taking over free speech, I'm against it.
[01:02:35.579 --> 01:02:37.600]  I can intellectually prove why each point
[01:02:38.200 --> 01:02:42.823]  I'm correct, but, I mean, if George Soros is for it, I'm against it.
[01:02:42.823 --> 01:02:44.965]  It's real simple.
[01:02:44.965 --> 01:02:46.806]  George Soros wants to overthrow Ukraine?
[01:02:46.806 --> 01:02:47.927]  I'm against it.
[01:02:47.927 --> 01:02:50.308]  Now look at what a hellhole it is a year and a half later.
[01:02:50.308 --> 01:02:53.651]  The guy is the devil.
[01:02:53.651 --> 01:02:57.553]  What he is is like a head Nazgul.
[01:02:57.553 --> 01:02:59.975]  The head Ringwraith or something.
[01:02:59.975 --> 01:03:01.236]  That's all coming up.
[01:03:01.236 --> 01:03:04.338]  A secret Senate committee advances cyber security bill in secret.
[01:03:04.338 --> 01:03:05.399]  It's basically SOPA.
[01:03:06.263 --> 01:03:07.944]  And CISPA all rolled into one.
[01:03:07.944 --> 01:03:12.265]  I mean, it's all coming down right now.
[01:03:12.265 --> 01:03:16.086]  Coming up, after first lab-grown burger, Test Tube Chicken is next on the menu.
[01:03:16.086 --> 01:03:18.987]  Reuters.
[01:03:18.987 --> 01:03:20.508]  That's just some of what's coming up.
[01:03:20.508 --> 01:03:25.310]  And guys, do I have my stack that I was asking for on the fluoride brain damaging and all that?
[01:03:25.310 --> 01:03:27.290]  Is that in here?
[01:03:27.290 --> 01:03:27.730]  It's coming in.
[01:03:27.730 --> 01:03:31.172]  Alright, it's coming in, because that's what we're covering next with Dr. Group.
[01:03:31.172 --> 01:03:33.312]  Huge news on glyphosates.
[01:03:33.312 --> 01:03:35.013]  I need that glyphosate news as well.
[01:03:36.787 --> 01:03:37.047]  I don't
[01:03:56.886 --> 01:04:06.077]  Common chemicals causing cancer in your food, the root cause of hormone imbalance, what to do about it, how big pharma profits from wrecking our hormones, the truth behind testosterone creams and gels.
[01:04:06.077 --> 01:04:10.242]  We're going to break it all down coming up with Dr. Group and some other exciting news.
[01:04:10.242 --> 01:04:11.083]  What else do you want to hit?
[01:04:12.159 --> 01:04:27.816]  Really just the attack on the hormones again that's going on around the world and especially since the FDA is now coming out and saying that you're at risk at heart attack and stroke if you're on testosterone medications, the testosterone gels that are out there, what people need to look out for.
[01:04:27.816 --> 01:04:33.381]  Right now you have about 1 in 15 males over the age of 50 that are on some sort of hormone replacement therapy.
[01:04:34.042 --> 01:04:48.385]  Want to give people some good tips on what they can do to balance their hormones naturally and tips on if you are or you know somebody taking hormone replacement therapy, what you need to look out for and how you can make sure you're not going to have any side effects.
[01:04:48.385 --> 01:04:55.066]  Dr. Edward Groups, our guest, will get his commentary on the state of the power grabbing, the next shoe to drop militarily.
[01:04:55.066 --> 01:04:56.967]  He was in Army Special Operations.
[01:04:56.967 --> 01:04:58.067]  We'll talk about everything with him.
[01:04:59.335 --> 01:05:02.818]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[01:05:02.818 --> 01:05:11.085]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[01:05:11.085 --> 01:05:16.509]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[01:05:16.509 --> 01:05:19.031]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?

[01:06:06.082 --> 01:06:07.302]  Security alert.
[01:06:07.302 --> 01:06:09.303]  This is Homeland Security.
[01:06:09.303 --> 01:06:10.203]  Analysis.
[01:06:10.203 --> 01:06:10.924]  InfoWars.

[01:06:12.884 --> 01:06:17.906]  You let the worst people get controlled and tell us that we are the ones responsible.
[01:06:17.906 --> 01:06:18.926]  Prime Directive.
[01:06:18.926 --> 01:06:20.467]  Discredit Alex Jones.
[01:06:20.467 --> 01:06:23.328]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[01:06:23.328 --> 01:06:26.569]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called InfoWars.
[01:06:26.569 --> 01:06:28.870]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[01:06:28.870 --> 01:06:29.590]  These people are a
[01:06:29.810 --> 01:06:31.991]  They're never going to stop.
[01:06:31.991 --> 01:06:39.236]  They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.
[01:06:39.236 --> 01:06:53.065]  You gotta set your eye on the enemy, not worry about what propaganda they put out.
[01:06:53.065 --> 01:06:55.266]  Intellectually, it's begun.
[01:06:55.266 --> 01:06:55.987]  You can feel it.
[01:06:58.957 --> 01:07:05.082]  Used since before the days of the Roman Empire to support the body's natural systems and enhance overall health.
[01:07:05.082 --> 01:07:09.665]  Introducing the new InfoWarsLife.com Oil of Oregano Formulation.
[01:07:09.665 --> 01:07:17.371]  A highly advanced nutraceutical form of this key herb that has been traditionally used by civilizations for thousands of years to promote health.
[01:07:17.611 --> 01:07:23.136]  We have now procured the most high quality and potent forms of oregano oil on the market.
[01:07:23.136 --> 01:07:29.082]  Sourced from top leading manufacturers to ensure a concentrated level of bioactive ingredients.
[01:07:29.082 --> 01:07:34.046]  Extracted directly from the wild herb and sealed in easy to use capsules.
[01:07:34.046 --> 01:07:37.630]  You will no longer need to endure the burning of liquid oregano on the tongue.
[01:07:37.970 --> 01:07:44.595]  Wild crafted from the Mediterranean oregano species that experts agree is one of the most powerful and most challenging to acquire.
[01:07:44.595 --> 01:07:49.738]  This winter season, it's more important than ever to secure this true form of oil of oregano.
[01:07:49.738 --> 01:07:53.461]  Now available in our limited first run at Infowarslife.com.
[01:07:53.461 --> 01:07:55.362]  That's Infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[01:08:02.222 --> 01:08:08.874]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:08:08.874 --> 01:08:11.860]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:23.274 --> 01:08:26.037]  Ladies and gentlemen, coming up, we're going to recap.
[01:08:26.037 --> 01:08:27.398]  We got the 400 pages.
[01:08:27.398 --> 01:08:30.041]  It wasn't 300 and 30-something.
[01:08:30.041 --> 01:08:32.944]  The 400 pages of the FCC power grab.
[01:08:32.944 --> 01:08:37.889]  There is a reason that they kept this secret for more than two weeks, two weeks and a day.
[01:08:37.889 --> 01:08:43.975]  It is the federal criminal, in their words, takeover with the Justice Department.
[01:08:44.756 --> 01:08:48.583]  via the FCC and their field offices of all telecommunications.
[01:08:48.583 --> 01:08:53.232]  They also offer basically ObamaPhone that they're going to have free broadband for all.
[01:08:53.232 --> 01:08:55.055]  Well, taxpayers will pay for it.
[01:08:55.055 --> 01:08:56.959]  It'll come with strings attached and it'll be a corporate.
[01:08:57.853 --> 01:09:00.535]  Boondoggle to whoever gets to run those systems.
[01:09:00.535 --> 01:09:02.197]  It is a nightmare.
[01:09:02.197 --> 01:09:10.724]  I spent about 20 minutes on it last hour and we're going to get a report up in the next hour or so breaking all of that down.
[01:09:10.724 --> 01:09:18.612]  We're going to take the video from the live radio slash TV show and get that into Kit Daniel's article as soon as possible.
[01:09:19.252 --> 01:09:22.514]  From the 33 mark up to the end of the hour.
[01:09:22.514 --> 01:09:28.018]  That 20 minutes or so of broadcast, 25 minutes or so, is key intel.
[01:09:28.018 --> 01:09:30.680]  I read the subsections here on air.
[01:09:30.680 --> 01:09:33.042]  Because it mentions the authority and other U.S.
[01:09:33.042 --> 01:09:33.923]  Code areas.
[01:09:33.923 --> 01:09:34.904]  You go to that U.S.
[01:09:34.904 --> 01:09:39.127]  Code and then they even say it's the Justice Department.
[01:09:39.127 --> 01:09:40.848]  It's armed FCC people.
[01:09:40.848 --> 01:09:41.528]  It's fines.
[01:09:41.528 --> 01:09:42.609]  It's fees.
[01:09:42.609 --> 01:09:46.812]  It's people make complaints and they come and investigate you.
[01:09:46.812 --> 01:09:47.433]  It is on.
[01:09:49.562 --> 01:09:50.483]  It is a big deal.
[01:09:50.483 --> 01:09:52.426]  It'll take a few years for them to battle it out in court.
[01:09:52.426 --> 01:09:55.389]  Lawsuits are already being filed, but that's coming up.
[01:09:55.389 --> 01:10:00.215]  Benjamin Netanyahu is in trouble in the Israel election.
[01:10:00.215 --> 01:10:04.120]  We've got so much that we're going to be breaking down here today.
[01:10:04.120 --> 01:10:06.342]  Before I go any further,
[01:10:07.574 --> 01:10:22.048]  I wanted to mention some articles that we covered last week and earlier this week because Dr. Edward Grip joins us once a month in studio because he's here in Texas and travels to the Central Texas studios to join us.
[01:10:22.048 --> 01:10:24.130]  Dr. Edward Grip of the Global Healing Center.
[01:10:24.130 --> 01:10:30.015]  Water fluoridation linked to higher ADHD rates in major new studies.
[01:10:31.341 --> 01:10:33.882]  In the Journal of Environmental Health, okay?
[01:10:33.882 --> 01:10:35.343]  That's one of the most prestigious out there.
[01:10:35.343 --> 01:10:37.184]  That's Newsweek.
[01:10:37.184 --> 01:10:38.344]  We're forcing this out.
[01:10:38.344 --> 01:10:40.125]  You cannot hide this.
[01:10:40.125 --> 01:10:51.970]  90 plus percent of the scientists in the EPA and FDA, twice, have gotten together in the last decade and sent letters to their superiors at the head of the FDA and EPA saying, ban it.
[01:10:51.970 --> 01:10:53.950]  So the people in government are actually good.
[01:10:53.950 --> 01:10:57.572]  It's that the bureaucracy is run by big corporations that are blocking all this.
[01:10:57.572 --> 01:10:59.933]  When the dam breaks or the cover-up, it's over.
[01:11:01.513 --> 01:11:02.434]  Here's another one.
[01:11:02.434 --> 01:11:08.379]  Fluoride in drinking water may trigger depression, weight gain, warns scientists in a new study.
[01:11:08.379 --> 01:11:13.404]  And it goes into frying your thyroid, pancreas, depression, obesity.
[01:11:13.404 --> 01:11:15.026]  Absolutely.
[01:11:15.026 --> 01:11:16.587]  Let's continue.
[01:11:16.587 --> 01:11:18.369]  That is out of the London Telegraph.
[01:11:18.369 --> 01:11:20.551]  Impact of fluoride on neurological development in children.
[01:11:20.551 --> 01:11:22.713]  Now these two last articles were from this week.
[01:11:22.713 --> 01:11:23.814]  This one's from a few years ago.
[01:11:23.814 --> 01:11:24.575]  That's Harvard.
[01:11:26.854 --> 01:11:29.596]  Here is Environmental Health Perspectives.
[01:11:29.596 --> 01:11:33.038]  Developmental Fluoride Neurotoxicity.
[01:11:33.038 --> 01:11:36.860]  A systematic review of meta-analysis.
[01:11:36.860 --> 01:11:40.162]  And this goes into a huge study on brain damage, you name it.
[01:11:40.162 --> 01:11:42.963]  I mean, you wonder how people are dumb and in a fog?
[01:11:42.963 --> 01:11:44.184]  But here's what's more important.
[01:11:44.184 --> 01:11:47.186]  Prozac derivatives run off into all major water supplies.
[01:11:48.576 --> 01:11:52.738]  Hydrofluorosilicic acid is fluoride that's basically been electrically charged.
[01:11:52.738 --> 01:12:01.123]  I've had physicists, scientists, toxicologists, brain surgeons on, medical doctors, you name it, endocrinologists, they all concur.
[01:12:01.123 --> 01:12:02.504]  It's been in the literature forever.
[01:12:02.504 --> 01:12:08.907]  They knew back in the 30s that fluoride was an adjuvant and dumbed people down and made them submit.
[01:12:08.907 --> 01:12:10.748]  The Soviets and the Nazis put it in the water.
[01:12:10.748 --> 01:12:11.869]  That's a Pulitzer Prize winning book.
[01:12:11.869 --> 01:12:12.630]  Look it up.
[01:12:12.630 --> 01:12:13.190]  Nuremberg trial.
[01:12:14.380 --> 01:12:18.404]  But they also found it accelerates other drugs in the body.
[01:12:18.404 --> 01:12:21.828]  It magnifies, like an amplifier, their effect.
[01:12:21.828 --> 01:12:23.890]  That's why they put it in, folks.
[01:12:23.890 --> 01:12:26.132]  It is accelerating all the other toxins.
[01:12:26.132 --> 01:12:29.335]  And we're going to talk to Dr. Edward Grip, whose dad was a famous chemist.
[01:12:29.335 --> 01:12:31.137]  Dr. Grip's done massive studies on this.
[01:12:31.137 --> 01:12:32.419]  One of the leading experts.
[01:12:33.962 --> 01:12:39.466]  Now I went over all that because I've also got another article here.
[01:12:39.466 --> 01:12:44.590]  Study confirms chronic kidney failure five times higher in glyphosate ridden areas.
[01:12:44.590 --> 01:12:47.772]  And the studies, there's two of them, found five times higher.
[01:12:47.772 --> 01:12:50.254]  We put in the YouTube headline, maybe linked to it.
[01:12:50.976 --> 01:12:54.799]  I mean, Infowars, whoever wrote that headline, I'm not mad, but we actually kind of whitewashed it.
[01:12:54.799 --> 01:12:56.100]  We need to stop doing that.
[01:12:56.100 --> 01:13:03.165]  To all my crew, I talked to the whole crew here on air, you're great, but the study said there was five times fold increase.
[01:13:03.165 --> 01:13:08.329]  So the headline we have is five times fold increase in kidney failure in areas of the glyphosate and water.
[01:13:08.329 --> 01:13:09.930]  Then you can go read the study and make your own decision.
[01:13:11.254 --> 01:13:12.976]  But I mean, this is killing people.
[01:13:12.976 --> 01:13:15.578]  There's a reason they're opening up dialysis places all over.
[01:13:15.578 --> 01:13:18.300]  And you look at a map of where Roundup's used around the world?
[01:13:18.300 --> 01:13:21.003]  They didn't have all this kidney failure in Brazil 20 years ago.
[01:13:21.003 --> 01:13:22.604]  They bring it in, suddenly it skyrockets.
[01:13:22.604 --> 01:13:23.525]  Or Guatemala.
[01:13:23.525 --> 01:13:25.847]  Or Nigeria.
[01:13:25.847 --> 01:13:27.869]  Or Thailand.
[01:13:27.869 --> 01:13:28.830]  Or Sri Lanka.
[01:13:28.830 --> 01:13:29.811]  That's what's in these studies.
[01:13:32.369 --> 01:13:34.770]  Now, joining us is Dr. Edward Grieb.
[01:13:34.770 --> 01:13:44.355]  I'm going to try to shut up so he can roll over all this, but first I'm going to plug, because I didn't plug last hour, because it happens to dovetail with exactly why he came in today, and we'll show folks a shot of these household products.
[01:13:45.683 --> 01:13:50.305]  That are admitted testosterone blockers.
[01:13:50.305 --> 01:13:55.686]  You wonder why males in the West have a testosterone level about two-thirds lower than the average third world male?
[01:13:55.686 --> 01:14:00.108]  Why genitalia in blacks, whites, Hispanics, doesn't matter, are shrinking in size.
[01:14:00.108 --> 01:14:06.670]  Why 87 to 96, depending on what country you're in, of the sperm are dead, basically, or non-mobile, they don't have tails.
[01:14:08.536 --> 01:14:09.556]  Why is this happening?
[01:14:09.556 --> 01:14:16.660]  Because these chemicals are known to fry your entire male system.
[01:14:16.660 --> 01:14:19.741]  I mean, it works great if you want a big, giant prostate and to die of cancer.
[01:14:19.741 --> 01:14:23.303]  We're going to talk about all this coming up with Dr. Edward Groot.
[01:14:23.303 --> 01:14:28.525]  But, he developed Super Male and Super Female Vitality.
[01:14:28.525 --> 01:14:30.306]  Super Female Vitality is sold out right now.
[01:14:30.306 --> 01:14:34.367]  We just got it in, fortuitously, the day he was already scheduled to be here.
[01:14:34.367 --> 01:14:35.348]  It arrived on the truck.
[01:14:36.721 --> 01:14:42.907]  We are going to be able to now offer Super Male Vitality, sold out for two weeks, and I've got even better news.
[01:14:42.907 --> 01:14:47.972]  It is a Super Male Vitality that has three new ingredients in it.
[01:14:47.972 --> 01:14:53.217]  One of the ingredients we can no longer get and certify organic, and it was just a detoxifier that we have in the fluoride shield.
[01:14:53.217 --> 01:14:54.938]  We're going to have to discontinue that.
[01:14:54.938 --> 01:14:56.280]  The shellogy of an organic type.
[01:14:57.608 --> 01:14:58.028]  It didn't matter.
[01:14:58.028 --> 01:14:59.789]  That wasn't one of the boosters.
[01:14:59.789 --> 01:15:00.770]  That was just one of the cleaners.
[01:15:00.770 --> 01:15:12.836]  So we added three things for the one thing we took out, and I had an advanced batch before we manufactured it a few months ago, and quite frankly, I still like the Super Female the best, but this is better than the original Super Male.
[01:15:13.780 --> 01:15:14.080]  I think.
[01:15:36.781 --> 01:15:38.283]  That's what you're naturally supposed to have.
[01:15:38.283 --> 01:15:39.945]  Guys that are all roided out, it's terrible.
[01:15:39.945 --> 01:15:45.031]  But the natural way to do it is avoid these products and then take the proper herbs to boost it.
[01:15:45.031 --> 01:15:46.593]  Now, Dr. Group, that's a five-minute rant.
[01:15:46.593 --> 01:15:49.116]  We're going to skip this network break to give you time.
[01:15:49.116 --> 01:15:50.778]  The new Super Mill Vitality.
[01:15:50.778 --> 01:15:53.040]  Super female sold out, but Super Mill works for women as well.
[01:15:54.133 --> 01:15:56.595]  It's now available at Infowarslife.com.
[01:15:56.595 --> 01:15:58.336]  I want to thank you all for your purchases.
[01:15:58.336 --> 01:16:00.038]  It's what funds our operation.
[01:16:00.038 --> 01:16:02.359]  We sell high-quality water filtration that cuts out the fluoride.
[01:16:02.359 --> 01:16:09.725]  Yes, we sell what we use, what we believe in, what's high-quality, you know, win-win, you know, karmic deal.
[01:16:09.725 --> 01:16:11.266]  We only want to help others.
[01:16:11.266 --> 01:16:12.387]  That helps us.
[01:16:12.387 --> 01:16:14.769]  It's called being God-fearing, and it funds the operation.
[01:16:14.769 --> 01:16:15.770]  God has blessed us.
[01:16:15.770 --> 01:16:17.031]  Thank you for your support.
[01:16:17.031 --> 01:16:18.452]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:16:18.452 --> 01:16:19.673]  A limited supply.
[01:16:23.596 --> 01:16:30.405]  It'll be probably four weeks till we get more, but a limited first run is here of the new Supermail Vitality, new and improved.
[01:16:30.405 --> 01:16:34.491]  Dr. Gritt, before you do your presentation, on forget getting Supermail.
[01:16:34.491 --> 01:16:36.253]  There's things you can do, as you were telling me earlier.
[01:16:37.350 --> 01:16:46.221]  Right now, to boost your testosterone and a bunch of other things, and to keep the estrogen mimickers out of you, without buying diddly jack squat from us.
[01:16:46.221 --> 01:16:48.784]  Okay, it's very simple, but InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:16:48.784 --> 01:16:52.909]  New Supermail is available, InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:16:52.909 --> 01:16:56.233]  Talk about Supermail, the new formulation, then get into your presentation.
[01:16:56.653 --> 01:17:15.002]  Okay, so what we wanted to do with the new Supermail was make it more bioavailable, and then since we had the original Supermail Vitality out there for a long time, we were noticing that we could actually take a few of the herbs and change them around and strengthen some of them and then weaken a couple of the other ones.
[01:17:15.002 --> 01:17:23.386]  The whole goal was to create a stronger, more potent formula using advanced extraction methodologies.
[01:17:23.386 --> 01:17:24.907]  And just to explain that, people don't...
[01:17:25.367 --> 01:17:47.948]  What herbal extraction is cold-pressed concentrated most of the herbal supplements you're going to get out there are extracted using solvents and that's alcohol which is an endocrine disrupting chemical and other types of chemicals solvents and they use high heat but what we were trying to do especially and we did that with the original super male but now we've taken it to the next level to where we're able to
[01:17:48.588 --> 01:17:51.810]  It doesn't taste as good because it's stronger, I can tell that.
[01:18:17.028 --> 01:18:24.314]  Yeah, you can definitely taste more of the plant components, but as far as... I mean, it didn't taste good before, but now it tastes like you're drinking something serious.
[01:18:24.314 --> 01:18:26.336]  I mean... I'm gonna be honest with folks.
[01:18:26.336 --> 01:18:38.906]  The libido aspect of it, the mental acuity aspect of it, just feeling the fat-burning ability, all of the things that you got with the original Super Male Vitality,
[01:18:39.386 --> 01:18:53.653]  Now you're getting even increased effects with the new Super Male Vitality and the fact that we have the fulvic acid in there, which acts to carry those plant constituents into the cells deeper and make them more bioavailable.
[01:18:53.653 --> 01:18:59.816]  So all in all, I would say it's probably 20 to 30 percent more potent than the original Super Male Vitality was.
[01:18:59.816 --> 01:19:04.619]  It doesn't taste bad, it just, you know, you taste it and it's like, wow, that's something serious.
[01:19:05.439 --> 01:19:05.919]  Yeah, it is.
[01:19:05.919 --> 01:19:19.347]  And one of the things, you know, you have so many males out there right now that are on testosterone, either the patches or the injections, but the main concern that we talk about on this show all the time is the estrogen levels, the high estrogen levels.
[01:19:19.347 --> 01:19:23.029]  And today, I actually... Testosterone breaks down into estrogen, right?
[01:19:23.189 --> 01:19:39.267]  Yes, and in the mail it's estradiol and so one of the reasons why you're having side effects and the FDA coming down and saying testosterone causes strokes and heart attacks is not necessarily because of the testosterone that you're on but it's because of the high estrogen levels.
[01:19:39.267 --> 01:19:41.790]  Again, I've talked to weightlifters and people
[01:19:42.270 --> 01:19:47.835]  Who for years did take tests on things and they said, listen, these people I know personally, they said, man, this isn't a joke.
[01:19:47.835 --> 01:19:50.498]  I thought it was, you know, quack stuff because I've tried other supplements.
[01:19:50.498 --> 01:19:52.880]  This stuff is like hardcore.
[01:19:52.880 --> 01:19:53.781]  What in the world's in it?
[01:19:53.781 --> 01:19:56.844]  I know some of them have been around here and you've talked to them.
[01:19:56.844 --> 01:19:58.286]  But this is natural.
[01:19:58.286 --> 01:20:00.828]  And explain to people, this doesn't mimic testosterone.
[01:20:00.828 --> 01:20:01.809]  Explain to me how it works.
[01:20:01.809 --> 01:20:04.111]  You get your body's glands just to wake up?
[01:20:05.051 --> 01:20:21.819]  Okay, so how it works is the herbs that we chose are designed to boost the body's own production of testosterone, balancing the levels of testosterone to estrogen or estradiol in the body, as well as boosting your natural growth hormone production.
[01:20:21.819 --> 01:20:23.860]  So it actually causes the body to say,
[01:20:24.580 --> 01:20:28.001]  Well, do I need more to produce more testosterone today?
[01:20:28.001 --> 01:20:31.883]  It actually activates your reproductive system to produce more testosterone.
[01:20:31.883 --> 01:20:36.044]  Tell folks the things you've added to the formula, because you've added more things and removed one thing.
[01:20:36.044 --> 01:20:38.505]  Well, we actually didn't add anything.
[01:20:38.505 --> 01:20:42.567]  We just moved things around a little bit, and the reason we did... Well, then I misunderstood you.
[01:20:43.307 --> 01:20:47.372]  Yeah, we increased some of the herbs and made them stronger.
[01:20:47.372 --> 01:20:55.200]  We did switch to some organic herbs, some better sources and suppliers, but it was really more of the extraction process and the process.
[01:20:55.200 --> 01:20:56.762]  So the only thing that's different then is the Shellogy.
[01:20:57.776 --> 01:21:09.401]  The only thing that's different is the strength of the individual herbs that we put in there and we took the shilajit out and added fulvic acid, which really shilajit is mostly fulvic acid anyway.
[01:21:09.401 --> 01:21:13.383]  It's a fulvic acid and humic acid blend.
[01:21:13.383 --> 01:21:15.004]  And what does the fulvic acid do?
[01:21:15.004 --> 01:21:15.924]  That's an adjuvant, right?
[01:21:15.924 --> 01:21:16.685]  It turbo charges?
[01:21:17.205 --> 01:21:19.566]  Fulvic acid is... It makes everything in there stronger?
[01:21:19.566 --> 01:21:26.049]  It makes it more bioavailable, it makes it stronger, and fulvic acid in itself is a healing agent.
[01:21:26.049 --> 01:21:29.510]  It contains multiple minerals inside the fulvic acid.
[01:21:29.510 --> 01:21:41.675]  So if you combine, you know, 50-60 different minerals in that formula as well, it's almost like you have the soil and the actual herb inside the bottle at once.
[01:21:42.435 --> 01:22:10.125]  So you're going to get the humic and the fulvic content usually in good compost, so it's almost like we're taking the whole plant with the soil and processing it all together, and the end product is a herbal extraction that's done with a cold processing system that we're 10 or 15 years ahead of the time as far as extraction, because we're able to concentrate all of the components, especially the active components of the
[01:22:10.145 --> 01:22:14.307]  So it's not like dry herbs have been in a warehouse for five years and are basically dead.
[01:22:14.307 --> 01:22:19.330]  It's fresh, raw, organic, concentrated, and that's why it's having such a big effect.
[01:22:19.330 --> 01:22:24.073]  Well, one of the things that we try to do as much as we can is get the herbs as fresh as we can.
[01:22:24.073 --> 01:22:28.036]  And a lot of times it's good to dry them or even freeze dry them.
[01:22:28.036 --> 01:22:32.058]  And that preserves the components in those individual herbs.
[01:22:32.058 --> 01:22:38.542]  But yes, not using the high heat and when we can get herbs as fresh as we can, we get them cut and sifted.
[01:22:39.423 --> 01:22:46.069]  So really, to be fair, from a layman's perspective, when you read these ingredients, these are really concentrated mixtures
[01:23:03.326 --> 01:23:03.627]  I don't
[01:23:20.430 --> 01:23:28.172]  Alchemist ways of Paracelsus where Spigeric processing is separating and then recombining back to life.
[01:23:28.172 --> 01:23:37.734]  So the old way they used to do it is distill out the essential oils and then ferment the plant material and then use other different types of solvents.
[01:23:37.734 --> 01:23:47.337]  But now with the technology, we can actually take the plant material and combine and not lose the essential oils and the resins and all the active components of the plant.
[01:23:47.737 --> 01:23:56.301]  Any alcohol tincture that you find on the market out there is only probably 40% to 50% of the actual components, constituents.
[01:23:56.301 --> 01:23:59.442]  Well, my issue isn't the tiny bit of alcohol you get.
[01:23:59.442 --> 01:24:10.346]  It's that obviously the alcohol is going to basically suck out the nutrients and as a solvent break down the different ring structures of the trace elements and things that are in there.
[01:24:10.346 --> 01:24:13.268]  It's going to kill, like a microwave, what was there.
[01:24:14.008 --> 01:24:15.408]  To put it in layman's terms, is that right?
[01:24:15.408 --> 01:24:15.769]  Right.
[01:24:15.769 --> 01:24:18.670]  And alcohol in itself is an endocrine-disrupting chemical.
[01:24:18.670 --> 01:24:34.555]  So, besides the fact that most alcohol is made from corn and is genetically modified, and that's one of the reasons why, you know, even with net neutrality, I mean, the government, the pharmaceutical companies, we look all around us and it's all a chemical attack.
[01:24:34.555 --> 01:24:42.698]  And the chemical attack is to reduce your immune system, create illness, and then try to come on the back end and manage that illness
[01:24:42.858 --> 01:25:02.374]  Well, that's what I was going to get to next, is that when you look at Mainline Newsweek, Mainline Harvard, Mainline London Telegraph, yes, fluoride is making you fat, is giving you cancer, is making your thyroid screw up, you know, either get low or high thyroid, it says, is causing ADHD.
[01:25:02.374 --> 01:25:07.218]  That's everything you and Dr. Blaylock and everybody have been saying for decades.
[01:25:07.218 --> 01:25:08.359]  It's in the medical literature.
[01:25:09.019 --> 01:25:13.820]  Just like vaccines hurting people are, how long can they keep covering it up?
[01:25:13.820 --> 01:25:27.364]  A, and then B, what do you make of the schizophrenia where National Geographic in one issue said that fluoride's really bad for you, but then in the next issue made fun of people.
[01:25:27.364 --> 01:25:28.285]  What's going on?
[01:25:28.285 --> 01:25:31.086]  Because used to they just said it's good for you, shut up.
[01:25:31.086 --> 01:25:35.547]  Now, what is mainstream doing telling the truth?
[01:25:37.128 --> 01:25:37.729]  Finally!
[01:25:37.729 --> 01:25:42.292]  I mean, the more people that get educated on the negative effects of fluoride, the better.
[01:25:42.292 --> 01:25:45.554]  I think it's coming to a point where people are demanding the truth.
[01:25:45.554 --> 01:25:48.256]  And so many journalists have brain-damaged kids.
[01:25:48.256 --> 01:25:52.480]  Nothing will wake you up like taking your two-year-old for a shot and they start bleeding out the nose and never talk again.
[01:25:52.480 --> 01:25:54.061]  That'll kind of wake you up, won't it?
[01:25:54.341 --> 01:25:57.266]  And that's the same thing that's happening, I think, really across the board.
[01:25:57.266 --> 01:26:00.851]  I mean, look what happened with BPA with the baby bottles.
[01:26:00.851 --> 01:26:02.093]  I mean, there was a big outcry.
[01:26:02.093 --> 01:26:09.704]  And I think once the public gets to a certain point, then, and like you said, once these studies come out,
[01:26:10.325 --> 01:26:11.785]  It's getting into the mainstream.
[01:26:11.785 --> 01:26:12.946]  It's getting into the journals.
[01:26:12.946 --> 01:26:20.967]  I mean, you can look at the mainstream medical journals across the board, and yes, they still do put out a lot of bad stuff.
[01:26:20.967 --> 01:26:27.289]  But at the same time, there's a demand that people want to know about phthalates and the effects on the thyroid.
[01:26:27.289 --> 01:26:32.970]  There's independent scientists, independent doctors that are pushing... Well, what about McDonald's and Dreyer's Ice Cream?
[01:26:32.970 --> 01:26:34.430]  I mean, it's no exaggeration.
[01:26:34.430 --> 01:26:35.911]  10, 15 companies a week.
[01:26:35.911 --> 01:26:37.071]  But McDonald's is the biggest.
[01:26:37.962 --> 01:26:41.927]  The number one retail food seller out there for fast food worldwide.
[01:26:41.927 --> 01:26:46.332]  They're pulling GMO wheat, GMO corn, they say.
[01:26:46.332 --> 01:26:49.275]  They're pulling high fructose corn syrup, they claim.
[01:26:49.275 --> 01:26:50.296]  They're going in that direction.
[01:26:50.296 --> 01:26:55.042]  They claim they're pulling the synthetic growth hormone out of their milk.
[01:26:55.042 --> 01:26:57.365]  I mean, these are devastating victories.
[01:26:58.755 --> 01:27:00.858]  They are devastating victories, which are great.
[01:27:00.858 --> 01:27:10.068]  I mean, I've always said the best way to attack this is to not buy the things that are dangerous, that are ruining the environment and ruining your health.
[01:27:10.068 --> 01:27:14.433]  Well, what is the elite going to do, though, as people start to wake up and actually read the vaccine insert?
[01:27:14.433 --> 01:27:14.633]  I mean...
[01:27:15.669 --> 01:27:18.871]  I know this since I started reading the inserts on air every week, erotically.
[01:27:18.871 --> 01:27:19.912]  They are coming after us, man.
[01:27:19.912 --> 01:27:20.672]  They are mad.
[01:27:20.672 --> 01:27:22.793]  Just because we're reading the insert.
[01:27:22.793 --> 01:27:26.816]  From what I hear, they're going to start vaccinating people through the air.
[01:27:26.816 --> 01:27:28.817]  That's what Bill Gates is funding, yeah, and his food.
[01:27:28.817 --> 01:27:30.398]  You know, there's nothing you can do about that.
[01:27:30.398 --> 01:27:36.482]  I mean, if they mix vaccines in with the chemtrails and they already have all these quadrivalent and hexavalent and trivalent things.
[01:27:37.482 --> 01:27:46.891]  They can, you know, easily surround them with lipid profiles and stuff like that to where they're not going to be damaged in the air by, you know, they can float down right on.
[01:27:46.891 --> 01:27:48.392]  Time release, nasally delivered.
[01:27:48.392 --> 01:27:49.353]  That's the thing.
[01:27:49.353 --> 01:27:57.200]  That's part of the reason why they were saying, oh, let's contain this measles outbreak at Disneyland or Disney World or whatever.
[01:27:57.200 --> 01:27:58.361]  They're starting to say, okay,
[01:27:59.798 --> 01:28:14.227]  We, in the future, we can rope off an area by air or, you know, set up military, you know, personnel around that area or whatever, and it's going to be a lot easier to just go over and spray the whole city.
[01:28:14.227 --> 01:28:20.691]  Yeah, for those that don't read it, for those that don't read, the crew can pull this up, Bill Gates developing
[01:28:21.929 --> 01:28:23.910]  Vaccines in bananas.
[01:28:23.910 --> 01:28:25.050]  Vaccines in corn.
[01:28:25.050 --> 01:28:26.450]  Vaccines to be sprayed by air.
[01:28:26.450 --> 01:28:28.711]  Vaccines to be delivered by mosquito.
[01:28:28.711 --> 01:28:31.372]  Quote, so people can't get away with avoiding it.
[01:28:31.372 --> 01:28:34.033]  And you know they're already testing it on the third world.
[01:28:34.033 --> 01:28:35.353]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:28:35.353 --> 01:28:39.114]  So what I've been saying is, don't buy the Roundup, the glyphosate.
[01:28:39.114 --> 01:28:43.516]  I mean, really, would you look at it, if you look at the... Why are you racist against kidney failure?
[01:28:44.335 --> 01:28:45.936]  Because I don't want to see kidney failure.
[01:28:45.936 --> 01:28:47.176]  I don't want to see people go through.
[01:28:47.176 --> 01:28:49.417]  And that's a good point that you made with all the dialysis.
[01:28:49.417 --> 01:28:52.439]  I don't even remember a dialysis center when I was growing up.
[01:28:52.439 --> 01:28:57.181]  But not only are you seeing dialysis centers everywhere, you're seeing infertility clinics everywhere.
[01:28:57.181 --> 01:29:00.002]  By the way, look at those headlines.
[01:29:00.002 --> 01:29:03.263]  Bill Gates unleashes swarm of mosquitoes on crowd.
[01:29:03.263 --> 01:29:04.144]  Fox News.
[01:29:04.144 --> 01:29:06.705]  Then you go back to the Bill and Melinda Gates website, it's all on there.
[01:29:07.813 --> 01:29:10.075]  Yeah, Bill Gates is uh... He's just as bad as Soros.
[01:29:10.075 --> 01:29:15.338]  You're talking about Soros, but I mean Bill Gates is just as bad and you know... Probably worse.
[01:29:15.338 --> 01:29:21.882]  Probably, probably, but... I don't know how at 87 or whatever it is, how Soros is just involved in everything.
[01:29:21.882 --> 01:29:23.283]  He's got the energy of like a 14 year old.
[01:29:24.788 --> 01:29:27.310]  He's got some alien technology or something, I don't know.
[01:29:27.310 --> 01:29:37.018]  But he probably does have some sort of, you know, microchip or something that's controlling... I don't know how... I mean, the guy's got the energy of like 500 devils.
[01:29:37.018 --> 01:29:38.058]  I mean, I don't know how he does it.
[01:29:38.058 --> 01:29:40.580]  Doesn't matter, we're gonna come after him with everything we've got.
[01:29:40.580 --> 01:29:42.242]  He wants a fight, he's gonna get it.
[01:29:42.242 --> 01:29:43.543]  Stay with us, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:29:43.543 --> 01:29:48.446]  We're gonna look at these products when we come back and warn you how to boost your testosterone naturally straight ahead.
[01:29:48.446 --> 01:29:49.847]  We're on the march.
[01:29:49.847 --> 01:29:51.349]  The Empire's on the run.

[01:30:31.874 --> 01:30:40.500]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections, and adenosylcobalamin, the most bioactive form that has been created with our proprietary process.
[01:30:40.500 --> 01:30:43.562]  Secret 12 is taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.
[01:30:43.562 --> 01:30:45.103]  No needles, no injections.
[01:30:45.103 --> 01:30:46.484]  Don't take my word for it.

[01:31:03.474 --> 01:31:07.735]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[01:31:07.735 --> 01:31:09.515]  Can you put two and two together?
[01:31:09.515 --> 01:31:17.377]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[01:31:17.377 --> 01:31:18.517]  But for how long?

[01:31:41.132 --> 01:31:46.555]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.

[01:32:53.816 --> 01:32:54.156]  Silver Bullet.
[01:33:17.145 --> 01:33:21.188]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[01:33:21.188 --> 01:33:24.551]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:24.551 --> 01:33:29.735]  Well, the Wu-Tang Clan head rappers come out and said the police basically got what they deserved.
[01:33:29.735 --> 01:33:33.278]  If you reap what you sow.
[01:33:33.278 --> 01:33:41.025]  So by that extension, if police just randomly go out and shoot black men, they deserve it because they're black.
[01:33:42.290 --> 01:33:47.874]  And undoubtedly there are probably some racist, scared cops out there that will probably be trigger happy now and shoot blacks.
[01:33:47.874 --> 01:33:50.916]  We put an article up about a month ago, we had to re-pull that.
[01:33:50.916 --> 01:34:01.363]  It was a mainline news article, but we broke it down in an article, where police are twice as likely to shoot a white or Hispanic statistically according to population.
[01:34:01.363 --> 01:34:04.866]  That's not saying there are more Hispanics or whites, whose numbers are about equal now in the country.
[01:34:05.836 --> 01:34:06.716]  That's all just people.
[01:34:06.716 --> 01:34:07.937]  I'm so sick of using these terms.
[01:34:07.937 --> 01:34:14.299]  The point is, is that blacks are much less likely to get shot.
[01:34:14.299 --> 01:34:19.901]  Most cops do not want all the paperwork and the lawsuits and to go to jail.
[01:34:19.901 --> 01:34:21.722]  Do they shoot innocent blacks sometimes?
[01:34:21.722 --> 01:34:23.202]  Yeah.
[01:34:23.202 --> 01:34:25.123]  But in a lot of these videos, they don't.
[01:34:25.123 --> 01:34:27.284]  And it turned out in the Brown case, it wasn't the case.
[01:34:28.243 --> 01:34:31.604]  It doesn't matter, George Soros, the Justice Department have been there stirring it all up.
[01:34:31.604 --> 01:34:39.246]  Dr. Gribb, just briefly, then I want to get into, you've got some of the household products right there, five household items destroying your hormones and making you fat.
[01:34:39.246 --> 01:34:42.746]  This isn't just news for men, we'll talk about what it's doing to women as well.
[01:34:42.746 --> 01:34:47.087]  So you don't have to buy Supermail Vitality to do this, folks.
[01:34:47.087 --> 01:34:49.808]  You can just stay off this stuff and you'll see a huge effect.
[01:34:49.808 --> 01:34:53.289]  I know I have over the years, trying to only use natural products.
[01:34:54.505 --> 01:35:16.178]  But if you do want to support the broadcast and try something that's had really amazing effects for myself, you've heard the listeners and their rave reviews, the new formula, that I guess is just increased power, increased strength, you're saying 30 or more percent, of Super Mel Vitality is here, available at infowarslife.com, and your purchase makes all of this possible.
[01:35:16.178 --> 01:35:23.363]  We have the methylcobalamin-based, super organic, super concentrated, higher absorption rate from the information we've looked at.
[01:35:24.003 --> 01:35:25.845]  of vitamin B12 in the mouth.
[01:35:25.845 --> 01:35:27.207]  It's just pure vitamin B12.
[01:35:27.207 --> 01:35:28.408]  Two different types.
[01:35:28.408 --> 01:35:30.230]  80% methylcobalamin.
[01:35:30.230 --> 01:35:32.553]  We have the Lung Cleanse that folks love.
[01:35:32.553 --> 01:35:36.577]  That's, what is it, close to 20 natural concentrated herbs and extracts.
[01:35:36.577 --> 01:35:38.038]  It's super thick though.
[01:35:38.038 --> 01:35:43.905]  Only problem is you gotta wash out the spray cap sometimes because it isn't like something with two or three ingredients and some menthol.
[01:35:43.905 --> 01:35:45.487]  It's really thick essential oil.
[01:35:46.027 --> 01:35:46.407]  Thank you.
[01:36:05.261 --> 01:36:08.403]  Mediterranean sourced, a variety of the strongest type.
[01:36:08.403 --> 01:36:11.305]  Very low price on that for a well of oregano.
[01:36:11.305 --> 01:36:13.427]  We've got super high quality acupowder.
[01:36:13.427 --> 01:36:16.569]  It's kind of the poor man's version of DNA Force.
[01:36:16.569 --> 01:36:18.370]  It isn't just for the eyes.
[01:36:18.370 --> 01:36:24.694]  Just so many great products and if you try them, all we've gotten 99% of the time is rave reviews.
[01:36:24.694 --> 01:36:28.417]  We've had one caller and I think one email saying it didn't do anything for him.
[01:36:29.454 --> 01:36:33.077]  That was Supermail and Occupower.
[01:36:33.077 --> 01:36:36.039]  So, Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:36:36.039 --> 01:36:44.145]  And, you know, we don't do fun drives and get $450 million a year like NPR and then do fun drives every week.
[01:36:44.145 --> 01:36:46.887]  We don't have Globalist funding us.
[01:36:46.887 --> 01:36:50.290]  We don't plug every segment like other talk show hosts do.
[01:36:50.290 --> 01:36:51.671]  I'm not saying that's bad.
[01:36:51.671 --> 01:36:53.652]  Talk radio and the rest of the economy is in trouble.
[01:36:53.652 --> 01:36:55.054]  You've got to make money to operate.
[01:36:55.794 --> 01:37:03.116]  We maybe plug once or twice a day normally and then once a month or so we come in and spend maybe 10 minutes out of an hour really telling you about these great products.
[01:37:03.116 --> 01:37:09.078]  And we got 10% off of the super high quality water filtration systems at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:37:09.078 --> 01:37:11.379]  InfoWarsLife.com is a subsection.
[01:37:11.379 --> 01:37:13.699]  The ProPure G2, the clearly filtered.
[01:37:13.699 --> 01:37:15.680]  Cut out the glyphosate, cut out the fluoride.
[01:37:16.405 --> 01:37:17.286]  I mean, it's simple.
[01:37:17.286 --> 01:37:24.594]  Buy a high-quality filter at a low price, fund our operation, 10% off promo code WATER, and protect yourself and your family.
[01:37:24.594 --> 01:37:27.097]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:37:31.782 --> 01:37:33.924]  Back to Dr. Edward Group.
[01:37:33.924 --> 01:37:35.805]  You've got the floor, my friend.
[01:37:35.805 --> 01:37:43.610]  Let's get into just some of these products that we know are menacing our testosterone levels.
[01:37:43.610 --> 01:37:46.732]  Just like Associated Press reported seven years ago, we can pull this up.
[01:37:47.612 --> 01:37:48.713]  Uh, printer ink.
[01:37:48.713 --> 01:37:53.556]  Most printer ink has BPA in it that destroys your testosterone.
[01:37:53.556 --> 01:37:56.738]  So, we're just, again, it's in the money.
[01:37:56.738 --> 01:37:57.539]  That's another headline.
[01:37:57.539 --> 01:37:58.900]  Money has BPA in it.
[01:37:58.900 --> 01:38:01.421]  We're being bombarded by design.
[01:38:01.421 --> 01:38:03.563]  Speak first to the master plan.
[01:38:03.563 --> 01:38:05.744]  Clearly, they know fluoride's doing this.
[01:38:05.744 --> 01:38:07.886]  Clearly, they know the vaccines are doing it.
[01:38:07.886 --> 01:38:08.846]  What's the end game?
[01:38:08.846 --> 01:38:17.252]  And then break down how we can at least mitigate some of this by getting natural products that in many cases are less expensive than the toxic forms of them.
[01:38:18.413 --> 01:38:25.097]  Well, originally when I was doing my research as to the root cause of all disease, it all linked back to chemicals.
[01:38:25.097 --> 01:38:29.080]  But then when you start looking at the chemicals and saying, okay, how does that affect the body?
[01:38:29.080 --> 01:38:37.025]  The big picture starts coming into play because you realize that the majority of the chemicals are going to have an effect on the thyroid gland.
[01:38:37.245 --> 01:38:40.088]  Or they're going to have an effect on the intestinal lining.
[01:38:40.088 --> 01:38:43.051]  Those are all endocrine glands and those produce hormones.
[01:38:43.051 --> 01:38:44.172]  That's what keeps you happy.
[01:38:44.172 --> 01:38:45.754]  That's what keeps you strong.
[01:38:45.754 --> 01:38:52.561]  Pretty much all the symptoms that people develop, negative symptoms in their life, are all due to some form of chemical.
[01:38:52.561 --> 01:38:53.281]  But the link
[01:38:54.341 --> 01:39:04.628]  With the hormones was really incredible because it got deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper because we started linking everything in the kitchen.
[01:39:04.628 --> 01:39:07.650]  You can link it to the introduction to microwave ovens.
[01:39:07.650 --> 01:39:11.593]  And then the plastic foods that go into microwave ovens.
[01:39:11.593 --> 01:39:12.454]  The phthalates.
[01:39:13.374 --> 01:39:24.717]  All of the chemicals, and linking back to the chemical companies, the pharmaceutical companies, and the relationship between all of them, that they don't even have to list most of the chemicals on the label.
[01:39:24.717 --> 01:39:39.960]  There's 80,000 toxic carcinogenic chemicals that are allowed by the FDA, by the USDA, by our government, that are allowed to be put in household products, and they know that if they can affect your hormone problems, number one,
[01:39:40.780 --> 01:39:47.543]  You're going to have a population control system going on because the male sperm count is going to go way down.
[01:39:47.543 --> 01:39:53.366]  You're going to have high, high estrogen content in males and females.
[01:39:53.366 --> 01:39:54.846]  Obesity rates are going to rise.
[01:39:54.846 --> 01:39:57.127]  Diabetes rates exponentially.
[01:39:57.127 --> 01:40:02.730]  If you mess with the hormone levels, you're going to see a rise in every single degenerative disease.
[01:40:02.730 --> 01:40:09.113]  You're going to see a rise in death and you're also going to see a reduction of births and
[01:40:09.833 --> 01:40:14.744]  You know, with fertility, you're going to start seeing infertility and sterility and the scary thing about this is...
[01:40:16.320 --> 01:40:19.803]  And all these chemicals... By the way, document everything neurotically.
[01:40:19.803 --> 01:40:26.368]  Put up sperm counts plummet in the West and it'll show 86 to 90-something percent.
[01:40:26.368 --> 01:40:28.029]  It'll be BBC, AP Reuters.
[01:40:28.029 --> 01:40:29.890]  Hit the enemy hard.
[01:40:29.890 --> 01:40:30.771]  That's why the enemy hates us.
[01:40:30.771 --> 01:40:32.212]  We just show everything.
[01:40:32.212 --> 01:40:34.114]  All we're doing is showing people what's actually admitted.
[01:40:34.114 --> 01:40:35.294]  Go ahead.
[01:40:35.294 --> 01:40:39.097]  And that's all traceable back because you're not going to get any of these chemicals.
[01:40:39.097 --> 01:40:41.900]  They're going to come in through your skin or they're going to come in through your mouth.
[01:40:41.900 --> 01:40:43.801]  Wall Street Journal, the decline in male fertility.
[01:40:43.801 --> 01:40:44.161]  Look at that.
[01:40:44.161 --> 01:40:44.942]  Hit them and hit them hard.
[01:40:45.282 --> 01:40:59.812]  Yep, and you said earlier the glyphosate and not only glyphosate but the atrazine and those are two heavily produced hormone endocrine disrupting chemicals that are sprayed on 80% of the crops that have all gotten into the water system.
[01:40:59.812 --> 01:41:01.813]  How do you avoid all these things?
[01:41:01.813 --> 01:41:06.796]  Men ask me what are some of the most common things that I'm doing that I can eliminate right now?
[01:41:06.796 --> 01:41:08.758]  Look at that headline!
[01:41:08.758 --> 01:41:12.260]  TV, 20 hours a week, cut sperm count in half according to a new study.
[01:41:12.260 --> 01:41:12.961]  What source is that?
[01:41:13.732 --> 01:41:14.772]  That's out of London Independent.
[01:41:14.772 --> 01:41:18.773]  I mean, I already knew that, and cause of neurological disorders, the television is a weapon.
[01:41:18.773 --> 01:41:20.114]  Right, and cell phones.
[01:41:20.114 --> 01:41:25.575]  Cell phones also alter the production of testosterone and alter the sperm.
[01:41:25.575 --> 01:41:26.875]  They break DNA.
[01:41:26.875 --> 01:41:28.136]  They cause sperm mutations.
[01:41:28.136 --> 01:41:29.076]  Right, that's right.
[01:41:29.076 --> 01:41:37.198]  So, you know, you can go through your house and find a majority of things, but really, one of the key things is men, I mean, women have
[01:41:37.638 --> 01:41:38.879]  Hormone imbalances too.
[01:41:38.879 --> 01:41:41.240]  I mean, they're more attuned to theirs.
[01:41:41.240 --> 01:41:46.943]  Men, they just start getting lethargic, they start losing their energy levels, they start accumulating fat around their stomach.
[01:41:46.943 --> 01:41:54.167]  And that fat around the stomach is all due to high estrogen levels, estradiol levels in males and low testosterone.
[01:41:54.167 --> 01:41:59.570]  Also, something that's not talked about a lot is males actually produce progesterone as well.
[01:41:59.570 --> 01:42:03.252]  And we're seeing that progesterone levels in male are almost nil.
[01:42:03.252 --> 01:42:05.654]  So, you have high estradiol levels,
[01:42:06.394 --> 01:42:11.418]  Extremely low testosterone levels and virtually non-existent progesterone levels.
[01:42:11.418 --> 01:42:15.300]  And those hormones really control everything.
[01:42:15.300 --> 01:42:25.728]  There's no reason that our grandfathers were super good looking, skinny and would eat giant meals and didn't even really work out other than doing stuff on the ranch or whatever.
[01:42:25.728 --> 01:42:29.771]  And then now I've seen the studies that we eat less than people used to.
[01:42:29.771 --> 01:42:32.993]  It's just the additives and the crud and all of it.
[01:42:32.993 --> 01:42:35.555]  That's why you have these giant fat people everywhere.
[01:42:36.115 --> 01:42:38.376]  Practically every cosmetic product.
[01:42:38.376 --> 01:42:41.278]  I mean, just for example, most men use deodorant.
[01:42:41.278 --> 01:42:42.338]  Let's talk about these products.
[01:42:42.338 --> 01:42:44.840]  You're not just singling out Speed Sticker, Dial.
[01:42:44.840 --> 01:42:47.361]  I mean, it's in all of them, but go over.
[01:42:47.361 --> 01:42:48.021]  What to look for?
[01:42:48.021 --> 01:43:04.490]  As a matter of fact, like 95% of the deodorants out there, and you don't think that it's a big deal just putting one or two strips of deodorant on every morning, but you have to remember that deodorant has aluminum, which is a metalloestrogen, and it's a hormone-disrupting chemical.
[01:43:04.490 --> 01:43:05.210]  An adjuvant, right?
[01:43:05.410 --> 01:43:09.775]  Yep, and all of the chemicals that are in here are all plasticizers.
[01:43:09.775 --> 01:43:11.397]  It's in a plastic bottle.
[01:43:11.397 --> 01:43:14.201]  These are all benzene, you know, you can't even pronounce half of them.
[01:43:14.201 --> 01:43:16.123]  There's polyethylene glycol in here.
[01:43:17.653 --> 01:43:22.274]  90% of the chemicals inside deodorant, including the aluminum, are toxic to the body.
[01:43:22.274 --> 01:43:26.695]  Explain, your dad was a famous petrochemical chemist.
[01:43:26.695 --> 01:43:31.516]  They have all these distillates, the stuff they have to store or get rid of, so they just put it in thousands of products.
[01:43:31.516 --> 01:43:36.916]  Right, and actually what most people don't know is the toxic chemicals are listed under fragrance.
[01:43:36.916 --> 01:43:45.138]  And that's how they get away with listing the most toxic chemicals, because the FDA allows them to put fragrance on there because it's a proprietary chemical formula.
[01:43:45.598 --> 01:43:54.708]  And most of the most damaging estrogen mimickers and toxic chemicals that disrupt your hormone levels are actually listed under fragrance.
[01:43:54.708 --> 01:43:57.752]  And you're going to see that in all cosmetic products.
[01:43:57.752 --> 01:44:00.415]  My dad actually was a co-developer of Saran Wrap.
[01:44:00.415 --> 01:44:04.359]  He was one of the first inventors of PVC plastics, actually.
[01:44:05.080 --> 01:44:18.770]  So, uh, and I just found out recently that he was about to come out with a report that, uh, a study saying that the plastics are directly linked to cancer and hormonal deficiencies and everything else.
[01:44:18.770 --> 01:44:21.392]  Which is now proven, and then what happened to him right after that happened?
[01:44:21.392 --> 01:44:21.953]  He was killed.
[01:44:23.231 --> 01:44:27.955]  I mean, you know, all of a sudden he got cancer in his throat one day, and a week later he was dead.
[01:44:27.955 --> 01:44:30.317]  And then a bunch of guys in suits showed up at my mom's house.
[01:44:30.317 --> 01:44:31.618]  I was there when they came in.
[01:44:31.618 --> 01:44:34.320]  They had a stack of paperwork this thick.
[01:44:34.320 --> 01:44:34.960]  You know, I was young.
[01:44:34.960 --> 01:44:36.321]  I didn't really understand what was going on.
[01:44:36.321 --> 01:44:42.526]  She was grieving, and they basically said, look, we're going to give you $250,000, sign all these documents, and then that's it.
[01:44:42.526 --> 01:44:45.188]  And then they put a memorial for my dad.
[01:44:45.188 --> 01:44:50.593]  They built a whole lake, and they put a little memorial thing up there at the Exxon Baytown facility.
[01:44:51.923 --> 01:44:54.605]  We ought to go to that and show that in a documentary about that.
[01:44:54.605 --> 01:44:55.165]  Yeah, we should.
[01:44:55.165 --> 01:44:57.526]  I don't even know if it's still there, but I had pictures of it.
[01:44:57.526 --> 01:44:59.788]  I went out there one time and they had the bench and everything.
[01:44:59.788 --> 01:45:01.409]  Oh, I'm sure it's there.
[01:45:01.409 --> 01:45:08.853]  But my family history goes back to the Webster's, the Appellateia Webster, who was the original author of the U.S.
[01:45:08.853 --> 01:45:09.554]  Constitution.
[01:45:10.374 --> 01:45:25.383]  And my, you know, the group family goes back to the Webster family on my grandmother's side, and Noah Webster, who's my great-great-great-great-grandfather, was the one that wrote the Webster's Dictionary, and also put the hidden, you know, Masonic Code in the Webster's Dictionary, too.
[01:45:25.383 --> 01:45:27.945]  So, I have a long history with the U.S.
[01:45:27.945 --> 01:45:34.589]  and considering my great-great-great-great-great-grandfather is the one that actually... Well, a lot of folks that settled Texas do, yeah.
[01:45:35.009 --> 01:45:43.993]  Yeah, so, I mean, getting back to the personal care products, you know, it's a combination of things that happen that you're putting on your skin every single day.
[01:45:43.993 --> 01:45:46.374]  I mean, just take standard soap, for example.
[01:45:46.374 --> 01:45:50.195]  You have triclosan in there, which is an endocrine-disrupting chemical.
[01:45:50.195 --> 01:45:52.096]  You have phthalates in there.
[01:45:52.096 --> 01:45:55.177]  You have all different polyethylene glycol.
[01:45:55.177 --> 01:45:56.978]  There's probably 20... Explain to folks what...
[01:45:57.659 --> 01:45:58.979]  Polyethylene glycol is.
[01:45:58.979 --> 01:46:00.560]  Well, that's just antifreeze, basically.
[01:46:00.560 --> 01:46:02.421]  Yeah, you drink that, you're deader than a hammer.
[01:46:02.421 --> 01:46:08.963]  Right, and you're putting all that on your skin, and when you're in the shower... I mean, where do you put a nicotine strip on your skin?
[01:46:08.963 --> 01:46:11.784]  Imagine, under your arm, it's even more absorption.
[01:46:11.784 --> 01:46:13.684]  What's the word?
[01:46:13.684 --> 01:46:14.465]  Absorbing.
[01:46:14.465 --> 01:46:14.965]  Yes.
[01:46:14.965 --> 01:46:17.986]  I mean, it's being directly absorbed through your skin.
[01:46:17.986 --> 01:46:20.847]  Let's show some of the... And if the camera can zoom in, let's show some of the...
[01:46:21.207 --> 01:46:35.416]  So, your standard soap, your body spray, you know, all your body sprays, body gels, I put aftershave, but believe it or not, perfumes and colognes, because they have the toxic fragrances in there and people spray those all over their body.
[01:46:35.416 --> 01:46:40.199]  Another thing that's extremely damaging is the spray sunscreen.
[01:46:40.199 --> 01:46:45.022]  Oh, you go to the beach or Barton Springs, you're just breathing and these idiots are spraying all over them.
[01:46:45.322 --> 01:46:51.305]  Right, and they're just too lazy to smell over their skin, and all that's doing is going in and producing massive amounts of estrogen.
[01:46:51.305 --> 01:46:53.246]  What's in Barbasol?
[01:46:53.246 --> 01:46:54.246]  What's in Barbasol?
[01:46:54.246 --> 01:47:04.211]  That's going to be your shave cream, and you have stearic acid, you have trimethylamine, you have isobutane.
[01:47:04.211 --> 01:47:06.292]  You have butane, actually, in there.
[01:47:06.292 --> 01:47:07.933]  That's a bastard gas, mommy!
[01:47:07.933 --> 01:47:12.875]  You have 423 sodium lauryl sulfate, you have propane, and again, you have fragrance.
[01:47:13.115 --> 01:47:15.116]  Propane and propane accessories?
[01:47:15.116 --> 01:47:16.377]  That's right.
[01:47:16.377 --> 01:47:41.012]  So you're actually putting all those chemicals right on your face and you're putting it in on your skin and that's, you know, that's disrupting all of your normal endocrine gland function, disrupting your hormone balance, which is why, one of the reasons why we developed Super Female Vitality and Super Male Vitality because, yes, you need water is another big thing that you talked about with the fluoride.
[01:47:42.426 --> 01:47:57.639]  If you just use the water filtration system and you just drink clean and pure water, you're already eliminating the fluoride, the pesticide residue, the insecticide residue, all the endocrine-disrupting hormones.
[01:47:57.639 --> 01:48:06.787]  But they know when you disrupt your hormone levels that that's going to cause anxiety and it's going to cause depression and it's going to cause weight gain and lack of confidence.
[01:48:06.787 --> 01:48:07.627]  So what happens?
[01:48:08.408 --> 01:48:16.411]  Then you go to your psychologist, you tell your psychologist that you're feeling depressed, and what does your psychologist put you on?
[01:48:16.411 --> 01:48:21.613]  Paxil puts you on antidepressants, anti-anxieties, which are made of fluoride!
[01:48:21.613 --> 01:48:29.016]  So you're calcifying your pineal gland, your body's getting worse, your immune system's being depressed on a regular basis.
[01:48:29.016 --> 01:48:30.257]  So the solution is...
[01:48:31.926 --> 01:48:33.627]  Clean out your body.
[01:48:33.627 --> 01:48:36.830]  Avoid all of the chemical substances.
[01:48:36.830 --> 01:48:39.812]  Don't buy any more Roundup for your yard anymore.
[01:48:39.812 --> 01:48:46.857]  Now you can go online and find, you know, do-it-yourself natural organic insecticide mixes, pesticide.
[01:48:46.857 --> 01:48:49.319]  Get rid of all your cleaning products in your house.
[01:48:49.319 --> 01:48:51.721]  Replace them with natural substitutes.
[01:48:51.721 --> 01:48:55.124]  And you're eliminating, number one, all the hormone-disrupting chemicals.
[01:48:55.124 --> 01:48:59.307]  And not only hormone-disrupting chemicals, but disease-causing chemicals.
[01:49:00.703 --> 01:49:05.026]  Number two, you're not supporting any more of the big companies that are creating the chemicals.
[01:49:05.026 --> 01:49:08.048]  And then that will make the new dominant market the healthy stuff.
[01:49:08.048 --> 01:49:09.449]  And that's exactly what's happening.
[01:49:09.449 --> 01:49:21.938]  I mean, now you're starting to see the dominant market, McDonald's, you're starting to see people that were, you know, I'd like to see Monsanto stop all the GMO stuff and stop the Roundup and come out with an organic, natural alternative.
[01:49:21.938 --> 01:49:26.422]  But you will see that over time, because the demand is there.
[01:49:27.102 --> 01:49:31.586]  The organic movement, the natural movement is billion, billions of dollar industry.
[01:49:31.586 --> 01:49:32.847]  It's growing rapidly.
[01:49:32.847 --> 01:49:41.994]  All of the stores, the regular grocery stores that never wanted to jump on the organic bandwagon have now jumped on and they have a whole section in their store of organic stuff.
[01:49:41.994 --> 01:49:43.896]  Look at how brute has antifreeze in it.
[01:49:43.896 --> 01:49:44.816]  It says right there.
[01:49:44.816 --> 01:49:45.817]  Yeah.
[01:49:45.817 --> 01:49:47.178]  That's good for your cat.
[01:49:47.178 --> 01:49:49.680]  Yeah, you're just slapping it right on your face.
[01:49:50.683 --> 01:50:04.535]  You know, think of how many, I remember we had a joke when I was growing up that all the men would get Old Spice deodorant for Christmas every year, I mean Old Spice cologne for Christmas every year and splash it on, but think of
[01:50:05.563 --> 01:50:20.536]  And you know, it's not only, you're putting it on your skin, it's going into your body, but then you have to go to the bathroom too, so some of it gets absorbed in your system, it goes to the area of your body which can cause organ damage and everything else.
[01:50:20.536 --> 01:50:20.716]  Kidneys.
[01:50:20.716 --> 01:50:21.317]  Bladder.
[01:50:21.317 --> 01:50:25.040]  And then you go to the bathroom and it goes right back into the water supplies.
[01:50:25.040 --> 01:50:25.881]  It is a joke.
[01:50:26.081 --> 01:50:26.701]  It is a joke.
[01:50:26.701 --> 01:50:29.522]  And you know, people say they want to get rid of oil-based economy.
[01:50:29.522 --> 01:50:33.184]  I mean, nobody loves a big car with a big engine in it like I do.
[01:50:33.184 --> 01:50:35.665]  But let's face it, the oil economy is incredibly toxic.
[01:50:35.665 --> 01:50:41.187]  And the way we then put it into everything, instead of just having toxic waste and storing it, is insane.
[01:50:41.627 --> 01:50:46.690]  But it makes a lot of sense, and it dumbs the public down, and it is beyond science fiction.
[01:50:46.690 --> 01:50:53.094]  Infowarslife.com, folks, if you want to try to battle some of this, and regardless, you're funding the operation.

[01:51:29.867 --> 01:51:31.068]  Hear that?
[01:51:31.068 --> 01:51:36.450]  That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransack the place.
[01:51:36.450 --> 01:51:39.392]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed.
[01:51:39.392 --> 01:51:42.934]  You can prevent being the next victim of a break-in.
[01:51:42.934 --> 01:51:50.498]  Go to Faketv.com and discover a device that creates the illusion someone inside is watching TV, even when you're miles away.
[01:51:50.498 --> 01:51:55.100]  Security is a mindset, and Faketv should be part of your security solution.
[01:51:55.100 --> 01:51:57.521]  Be vigilant, but not fearful.

[01:51:59.918 --> 01:52:06.661]  Usually, the older one gets, the less you are able to absorb amino acids and the less you are able to repair the 100 trillion cells of your body.
[01:52:06.661 --> 01:52:11.063]  As a result, you'll have less energy, your tissues will shrink, and you'll become wrinkled.
[01:52:11.063 --> 01:52:14.544]  An older person will typically injure more easily and heal more slowly.
[01:52:14.544 --> 01:52:15.685]  Not fun!
[01:52:15.685 --> 01:52:24.088]  However, if you can consume a protein powder that is easier to absorb, then you may be able to gain back some strength, muscle, and speed of recovery.
[01:52:24.088 --> 01:52:28.850]  One World Whey is a highly digestible whey protein powder that may be the perfect answer for you.
[01:52:29.170 --> 01:52:30.351]  My name is Errol.
[01:52:30.351 --> 01:52:31.872]  I'm 74 years old.
[01:52:31.872 --> 01:52:34.453]  You know, the taste of One World Whey is amazing.
[01:52:34.453 --> 01:52:42.297]  I play pickleball, and since taking One World Whey and your Trace Mineral Supplement, I have more energy and recover faster from my working out.
[01:52:42.297 --> 01:52:48.601]  I used to take another grass-fed whey protein powder, but now I'm getting much better results using One World Whey.
[01:52:48.601 --> 01:52:49.101]  Call 888-988-3325.

[01:52:59.031 --> 01:53:01.873]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[01:53:01.873 --> 01:53:06.995]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[01:53:06.995 --> 01:53:15.120]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the Charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[01:53:15.120 --> 01:53:19.642]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[01:53:19.642 --> 01:53:23.464]  MyPatriotSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[01:53:23.604 --> 01:53:29.548]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[01:53:29.548 --> 01:53:32.730]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[01:53:32.730 --> 01:53:38.094]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality, storable foods from My Patriot Supply.
[01:53:38.094 --> 01:53:46.279]  Go to mypatriotsupply.com forward slash alex today for special offers on emergency food storage or call their preparedness specialist at 866-229-0927.
[01:53:46.279 --> 01:53:46.459]  That's 866-229-0927.
[01:53:55.925 --> 01:54:06.789]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:54:06.789 --> 01:54:09.070]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:54:11.001 --> 01:54:16.165]  Side issue, you can go to ReelAlexJones on Twitter to see our reporter, Rex Jones.
[01:54:16.165 --> 01:54:17.586]  Did a great report this week.
[01:54:17.586 --> 01:54:18.947]  Actually shot it last week.
[01:54:18.947 --> 01:54:20.809]  We took a few days off to go deep sea fishing.
[01:54:20.809 --> 01:54:22.970]  Well, it was rough, so I didn't go.
[01:54:22.970 --> 01:54:23.691]  I get seasick.
[01:54:23.691 --> 01:54:26.633]  Not super seasick, but they had up to 15 foot swells.
[01:54:26.633 --> 01:54:27.954]  My dad never gets seasick.
[01:54:27.954 --> 01:54:29.435]  He got seasick.
[01:54:29.435 --> 01:54:31.337]  He went on one of those big boats with like 50 people.
[01:54:32.233 --> 01:54:37.079]  They went out about 40 miles, and my son was in on catching as they let four different people battle it.
[01:54:37.079 --> 01:54:38.200]  It took hours.
[01:54:38.200 --> 01:54:40.062]  A seven-foot mako.
[01:54:40.062 --> 01:54:41.524]  Talk about a scary-looking shark.
[01:54:41.524 --> 01:54:43.787]  That's the number one attacker in open water.
[01:54:43.787 --> 01:54:45.709]  They go after people on purpose.
[01:54:45.709 --> 01:54:47.851]  Great whites bite you and let go of you.
[01:54:47.851 --> 01:54:48.993]  They think you're a seal.
[01:54:48.993 --> 01:54:49.513]  Not mako.
[01:54:49.513 --> 01:54:50.034]  They come at you.
[01:54:51.135 --> 01:54:56.338]  CJ was pointing out one time he was on the east coast and a bull shark chased him in.
[01:54:56.338 --> 01:54:59.159]  Those are the ones that attack you in shallow water.
[01:54:59.159 --> 01:55:01.700]  But he gaffed him everything.
[01:55:01.700 --> 01:55:05.782]  He's got some video that was shot on a phone.
[01:55:05.782 --> 01:55:08.004]  I've got to get it off my dad's phone.
[01:55:08.004 --> 01:55:09.825]  But it's pretty dramatic.
[01:55:09.825 --> 01:55:10.625]  And I mean, he went in.
[01:55:10.625 --> 01:55:12.346]  I'm really 12 years old.
[01:55:12.346 --> 01:55:14.587]  My dad said, he's going to be way more manly than you.
[01:55:14.587 --> 01:55:16.048]  You never would have handled.
[01:55:16.048 --> 01:55:17.248]  It wasn't a 12 hour trip.
[01:55:17.248 --> 01:55:18.269]  The fishing was so good.
[01:55:19.656 --> 01:55:23.399]  That they did 16 hours in like just really bad weather.
[01:55:23.399 --> 01:55:33.287]  And I went out, didn't go out, and he was just out there battling and catching grouper and snapper and he caught five sharks.
[01:55:33.287 --> 01:55:37.170]  Caught a reef shark, they had to let go, it was four feet long.
[01:55:37.170 --> 01:55:40.353]  He got a grouper up so big, the huge grouper.
[01:55:41.954 --> 01:55:43.597]  The hook came out.
[01:55:43.597 --> 01:55:45.941]  He's been out deep sea fishing probably 10 times.
[01:55:45.941 --> 01:55:48.746]  He said this was better than all of them combined.
[01:55:48.746 --> 01:55:54.335]  That's what's so great about our planet and just how interesting it is and how wonderful it is and the adventure of it.
[01:55:54.335 --> 01:55:55.817]  I don't know why I just went off in that direction.
[01:55:57.301 --> 01:55:57.982]  Well that's great.
[01:55:57.982 --> 01:56:13.278]  I mean, you know, I always say people need to do more things for fun because a lot of times they don't take enough time to do things and to relieve their stress levels and right now we're living in such a negative society even though there's a lot of change and I'm always like positive, positive, positive because
[01:56:13.979 --> 01:56:17.502]  There's always solutions for every situation.
[01:56:17.502 --> 01:56:22.045]  But one of the things that we used to do is ask patients when they came in, you know, what makes you happy?
[01:56:22.045 --> 01:56:25.468]  And a lot of the patients that were sick that came in... Nothing, let's say.
[01:56:25.468 --> 01:56:27.489]  They would say nothing or they would just start crying.
[01:56:27.489 --> 01:56:29.391]  I didn't know you were going to say that, but yeah.
[01:56:29.391 --> 01:56:29.871]  Yeah.
[01:56:29.871 --> 01:56:31.833]  All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.
[01:56:31.833 --> 01:56:32.753]  And for like the last 10 years,
[01:56:34.687 --> 01:56:44.712]  Well, going back 15 years, for about 10 years, I kind of just got so focused and depressed fighting tyranny that I just gained like 80 pounds, didn't care, had no fun, worked 14 hours a day.
[01:56:44.712 --> 01:56:45.912]  Not anymore.
[01:56:45.912 --> 01:56:48.633]  I'm going to have a good time in the midst of all this evil.
[01:56:48.633 --> 01:56:49.714]  I'm not going to let them get me down.
[01:56:50.936 --> 01:57:05.987]  I tell you what, I've noticed a huge difference in my life by taking the super male vitality and just because every guy over the age of 30, and I mean, the sad thing is you're starting to see children that are, you know, having gender
[01:57:06.947 --> 01:57:17.578]  Yeah, I mean, it's not like we're making this up.
[01:57:17.578 --> 01:57:23.524]  The fact is that we are running out of testosterone anyway, without all the estrogen mimics.
[01:57:23.524 --> 01:57:29.510]  What would you do with a son if you had a kind of sickly boy who wasn't manning up?
[01:57:31.171 --> 01:57:35.514]  I, well, I'm an 8-year-old boy and I have a 6-year-old boy.
[01:57:35.514 --> 01:57:38.036]  What's too young to take Supermail?
[01:57:38.036 --> 01:57:46.963]  Well, I actually give my boy, both of my boys, Supermail, you know, maybe once every couple of weeks or just to kind of stimulate that testosterone.
[01:57:46.963 --> 01:57:52.507]  They, I don't have any estrogen mimickers around, but even if you don't have it, you're still going to be exposed to it.
[01:57:53.067 --> 01:57:59.910]  If you eat out at any restaurant, you're going to have endocrine-disrupting chemicals because restaurants always use tap water to cook with.
[01:57:59.910 --> 01:58:02.051]  Plus, they have Teflon-lined pans.
[01:58:02.051 --> 01:58:05.713]  They use GMO oils to cook with.
[01:58:05.713 --> 01:58:08.674]  So, I mean, you know, you can't live in a bubble either.
[01:58:08.674 --> 01:58:11.976]  You just have to keep yourself clean and avoid as best as you can.
[01:58:11.976 --> 01:58:13.557]  But I use it with them.
[01:58:13.557 --> 01:58:15.157]  I take it on a regular basis.
[01:58:15.157 --> 01:58:16.018]  My wife takes the
[01:58:16.798 --> 01:58:18.579]  Super female vitality.
[01:58:18.579 --> 01:58:21.081]  We've noticed tremendous, you know, results.
[01:58:21.081 --> 01:58:22.682]  My energy levels have gone up.
[01:58:22.682 --> 01:58:26.704]  Oh, by the way, listeners have put it in their wife or husband's drink and not told them.
[01:58:26.704 --> 01:58:27.584]  It's not placebo.
[01:58:27.584 --> 01:58:31.967]  I mean... And you have hundreds, I mean, of reviews online.
[01:58:31.967 --> 01:58:35.689]  That's... I think the overall review is close to 4.5 stars.
[01:58:35.689 --> 01:58:40.472]  No nutraceutical companies even put reviews because they... Infowarslife.com.
[01:58:40.472 --> 01:58:41.672]  We're going to do five more minutes.
[01:58:41.672 --> 01:58:42.613]  Another guest is joining us.

[01:58:43.113 --> 01:58:43.814]  Thanks for being here.

[01:59:19.500 --> 01:59:23.162]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[01:59:23.162 --> 01:59:27.445]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[01:59:27.445 --> 01:59:29.206]  Can you put two and two together?
[01:59:29.206 --> 01:59:34.550]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds.

[02:00:06.750 --> 02:00:08.531]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:08.531 --> 02:00:09.652]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:09.652 --> 02:00:10.792]  You want answers?
[02:00:10.792 --> 02:00:11.913]  So do we.
[02:00:11.913 --> 02:00:13.414]  He's Dr. Groot.
[02:00:13.414 --> 02:00:17.616]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.616 --> 02:00:21.659]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:22.600 --> 02:00:28.348]  Final segment with my compadre, then we've got a special guest joining us to get into a host of issues.
[02:00:28.348 --> 02:00:31.833]  I'm gonna hit a bunch of breaking news at InfoWars.com as well.
[02:00:31.833 --> 02:00:36.199]  Dr. Group, we just had CJ and us discussing all the gender crisis, a lot of it's social.
[02:00:37.449 --> 02:00:46.171]  But that's to then confuse kids that are already genetically, as we know, what these hormones do in the womb, to baby development, to areas of the brain.
[02:00:46.171 --> 02:00:51.812]  I mean, there are people that have more female-style brains in a, quote, male chassis.
[02:00:51.812 --> 02:00:54.473]  There are women who kind of have male brains.
[02:00:54.473 --> 02:00:59.334]  You see a lot of the, you know, group of standard, you know, lesbians out there.
[02:01:00.314 --> 02:01:05.415]  Um, and, you know, I guess they call themselves, you know, kind of the diesel ladies or whatever.
[02:01:05.415 --> 02:01:06.655]  And, I mean, it is a type.
[02:01:06.655 --> 02:01:08.576]  Black or white, they look the same.
[02:01:08.576 --> 02:01:09.856]  There is something genetic there.
[02:01:09.856 --> 02:01:11.196]  We know that's always going on.
[02:01:11.196 --> 02:01:19.178]  I'm not here even judging anybody, but we're seeing gender bending in other mammals, in aquatic life, in fish, in amphibians.
[02:01:19.178 --> 02:01:25.259]  It's a host of things, but we know that these gender benders, you know, it's not social stuff driving down sperm counts 80 to 90%.
[02:01:26.559 --> 02:01:30.010]  I mean, what do you think at its heart is behind the cocktail?
[02:01:30.010 --> 02:01:30.933]  What's in that cocktail?
[02:01:32.125 --> 02:01:34.387]  No, there's more and more studies coming out every day.
[02:01:34.387 --> 02:01:46.215]  I mean, they're injecting, you know, scientists are injecting eggs with phthalates, which, or fragrances, or some of these endocrine-disrupting chemicals, and inside the egg, the males are turning into females.
[02:01:46.215 --> 02:01:52.240]  The water supply, you know, they're seeing frogs that are hermaphrodite frogs.
[02:01:52.240 --> 02:01:54.582]  Why are you a sexist against hermaphrodite frogs?
[02:01:54.582 --> 02:01:56.983]  Let's not discuss why they're having hermaphrodite problems.
[02:01:56.983 --> 02:02:00.146]  Let's just accept it and take the shot to become one, to prove you're not racist.
[02:02:00.646 --> 02:02:11.756]  Because the frogs are being exposed to chemicals which are changing them, which leads to these poor children who don't know whether they're a male or a female in their mind.
[02:02:11.756 --> 02:02:15.299]  And then to even have a clear sex role is now hurtful to someone else.
[02:02:15.299 --> 02:02:16.480]  We have to get rid of all of it.
[02:02:17.040 --> 02:02:19.841]  And the social aspect is, of course, acceptance and all that.
[02:02:19.841 --> 02:02:23.601]  But again, they're not addressing the root cause of the problem.
[02:02:23.601 --> 02:02:26.722]  And that's the problem in the United States, with the government, everything.
[02:02:26.722 --> 02:02:30.463]  Nobody addresses the root cause of the financial situation we're in.
[02:02:30.463 --> 02:02:34.164]  Nobody addresses the root cause of, you know, why disease exists.
[02:02:34.164 --> 02:02:38.484]  Nobody addresses the root cause of why we're starting wars over in the Middle East.
[02:02:38.484 --> 02:02:40.945]  Nobody addresses the root cause of any of these issues.
[02:02:41.665 --> 02:02:55.274]  And the root cause of why these children are having thoughts, or these male children think they're female, or these female children think they're male, is because of these chemicals.
[02:02:55.274 --> 02:02:57.136]  And that's not, and I'm not just saying that.
[02:02:57.136 --> 02:02:58.997]  Well, I never thought that.
[02:02:58.997 --> 02:03:00.278]  I never felt like that in my life.
[02:03:00.278 --> 02:03:08.663]  I gotta tell you, going on Super Mel Vitality and the X2 that, you know, obviously blocks the estrogens and blocks the bad halogens, I mean, I'm crazed.
[02:03:08.663 --> 02:03:11.065]  I just, I just really appreciate God creating women.
[02:03:11.685 --> 02:03:14.587]  I mean, I have not... I'm not having these problems.
[02:03:14.587 --> 02:03:23.092]  Well, let me tell you, the women are happy too, because not only does the super male and the super female, you know, get you back to where you were 12 or 13 again... Ah!
[02:03:23.092 --> 02:03:24.453]  Mine!
[02:03:24.453 --> 02:03:27.875]  But then you add some iodine to that too, and you activate your thyroid gland.
[02:03:27.875 --> 02:03:34.078]  Then you see, you know, once your system comes together, you know... You start acting like a crazed male, like you always did before.
[02:03:34.078 --> 02:03:40.062]  No, you start acting like a calm, adjusted male who has... I've always been a little crazed.
[02:03:40.062 --> 02:03:40.522]  Is that bad?
[02:03:41.988 --> 02:03:42.589]  I don't think so.
[02:03:42.589 --> 02:03:45.955]  I mean, I don't think it's bad to be a little crazed every now and then.
[02:03:45.955 --> 02:03:50.503]  But I have a secret formula that I'm going to give you which is going to make you happy and smiling all day long.
[02:03:50.503 --> 02:03:52.467]  I don't want that!
[02:03:52.467 --> 02:03:53.769]  I like the way I am!
[02:03:55.014 --> 02:04:00.697]  But the thing is, you know, what are you serving these kids in the schools that they're in?
[02:04:00.697 --> 02:04:06.839]  I mean, I'm trying to just create this campaign with these- Now you're against Michelle Obama.
[02:04:06.839 --> 02:04:10.221]  If you don't want the kids eating prison food, GMO, you're racist.
[02:04:10.221 --> 02:04:10.881]  I am.
[02:04:10.881 --> 02:04:20.865]  Because the kids don't even know who they are anymore because all the food that they're eating and the water that they're drinking is- Racist, racist, racist, racist!
[02:04:20.865 --> 02:04:21.766]  Racists go home!
[02:04:21.766 --> 02:04:22.606]  Racists go home!
[02:04:22.606 --> 02:04:23.466]  Racists go home!
[02:04:23.466 --> 02:04:24.347]  Racists go home!
[02:04:24.347 --> 02:04:24.447]  No!
[02:04:24.767 --> 02:04:25.187]  No!
[02:04:25.187 --> 02:04:25.608]  No!
[02:04:25.608 --> 02:04:25.948]  No!
[02:04:25.948 --> 02:04:27.649]  George Soros loves you!
[02:04:27.649 --> 02:04:28.070]  Eh!
[02:04:28.070 --> 02:04:28.490]  Eh!
[02:04:28.490 --> 02:04:29.511]  Eh!
[02:04:29.511 --> 02:04:32.173]  I think you took too much sleeper male vitality.
[02:04:32.173 --> 02:04:33.274]  Oh, I'm just repeating what they said.
[02:04:33.274 --> 02:04:35.956]  I told you it was 20-30% stronger, didn't I?
[02:04:35.956 --> 02:04:36.957]  Now look what happened.
[02:04:36.957 --> 02:04:37.977]  No, I'm just being silly.
[02:04:37.977 --> 02:04:39.839]  I'm trying to imitate one of these politically correct people.
[02:04:41.078 --> 02:04:43.301]  Group, the fact that you're even a man is racist.
[02:04:43.301 --> 02:04:47.768]  Listen, great job, Dr. Group, on the new formulation of Super Male Super Female, sold out right now.

[02:06:59.423 --> 02:07:00.684]  Another major health threat.
[02:07:00.684 --> 02:07:05.666]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[02:07:05.666 --> 02:07:08.327]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[02:07:08.327 --> 02:07:15.370]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[02:07:15.370 --> 02:07:18.391]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[02:07:18.391 --> 02:07:21.312]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[02:07:21.312 --> 02:07:23.333]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[02:07:23.333 --> 02:07:26.174]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[02:07:26.254 --> 02:07:31.976]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[02:07:31.976 --> 02:07:35.478]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[02:07:35.478 --> 02:07:38.579]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.

[02:07:57.128 --> 02:07:59.951]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:29.127 --> 02:08:32.511]  We're back live, my friends.
[02:08:32.511 --> 02:08:35.594]  Into the future.
[02:08:35.594 --> 02:08:37.397]  Richard Belzer is our guest.
[02:08:37.397 --> 02:08:41.902]  He's been on, I don't know, six, seven, eight times with us over the last four or five years.
[02:08:41.902 --> 02:08:43.083]  And one time he showed up.
[02:08:43.083 --> 02:08:44.024]  We ought to play that clip.
[02:08:44.024 --> 02:08:46.367]  In fact, see if you can find it on YouTube.
[02:08:46.367 --> 02:08:49.591]  All of a sudden, Christopher Walken comes and sits on his lap.
[02:08:50.575 --> 02:08:52.656]  We had a talk with Christopher Walken.
[02:08:52.656 --> 02:08:58.399]  I tell friends and family that, and they go, no, you didn't have Christopher Walken come sit on Richard Belzer's lap on the show.
[02:08:58.399 --> 02:08:59.059]  No, we did.
[02:08:59.059 --> 02:09:02.281]  But he joins us by phone today at Skypestown.
[02:09:02.281 --> 02:09:09.945]  Richard Belzer played Detective Sergeant John Murdoch on Law & Order, special units for 14 seasons.
[02:09:09.945 --> 02:09:10.486]  Say that again?
[02:09:10.486 --> 02:09:12.447]  Oh, it was Detective Munch.
[02:09:12.447 --> 02:09:13.847]  Detective Munch, okay.
[02:09:13.847 --> 02:09:14.648]  You're on air, right, CJ?
[02:09:15.740 --> 02:09:16.361]  Absolutely.
[02:09:16.361 --> 02:09:17.141]  Good!
[02:09:17.141 --> 02:09:23.907]  Because all the time they talk to me and I've told them, please just come on air, even if you're correcting me, because people ask me who I'm talking to.
[02:09:23.907 --> 02:09:26.949]  The New York Times may write an article about it that I've gone crazy.
[02:09:26.949 --> 02:09:32.654]  He's been on a bunch of other TV shows and movies, a veteran stand-up comic, actor, producer, best-selling author, talk show host.
[02:09:33.334 --> 02:09:39.539]  You can see his latest show, Richard Belzer's Conversation on the Intelligent Channel, and so much more.
[02:09:39.539 --> 02:09:49.486]  And he's got iBelz.com, I-B-E-L-Z.com, or BelzerBooks.com, and he's got a new book out we're going to talk about at the bottom of the hour.
[02:09:50.796 --> 02:09:55.860]  With George Norrie and David Wayne by Skyhorse Publishing, someone is hiding something.
[02:09:55.860 --> 02:09:58.702]  What happened to Malaysian Flight Airlines Flight 370?
[02:09:58.702 --> 02:10:04.125]  And then why was there its sister plane over Ukraine and then now another one?
[02:10:04.125 --> 02:10:06.107]  I mean, this is getting weird.
[02:10:06.107 --> 02:10:10.030]  So we'll talk about that coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[02:10:10.030 --> 02:10:11.431]  Before we go there, though,
[02:10:12.472 --> 02:10:14.015]  We covered it in the first hour.
[02:10:14.015 --> 02:10:15.237]  It's super important.
[02:10:15.237 --> 02:10:19.765]  We'll have an article out very soon at InfoWars.com on this.
[02:10:19.765 --> 02:10:23.050]  It'll be our top story, a red link, when it is out by Kit Daniels.
[02:10:23.050 --> 02:10:25.054]  The FCC is not protecting the internet.
[02:10:25.054 --> 02:10:25.995]  It is taking it over.
[02:10:26.684 --> 02:10:30.525]  We now have the 400 pages, not 332.
[02:10:30.525 --> 02:10:35.007]  First it was 322, then 332, and now it's 400 pages.
[02:10:35.007 --> 02:10:37.548]  It's a total Justice Department takeover.
[02:10:37.548 --> 02:10:42.189]  That's who enforces it, of the Internet, claiming all broadcast rules basically over it.
[02:10:42.189 --> 02:10:46.430]  It's very scary what they claim, what they're going to do.
[02:10:46.430 --> 02:10:47.971]  We're going to talk about that coming up.
[02:10:49.377 --> 02:10:56.841]  And it's also a big giveaway to the corporations to provide, quote, free broadband this taxpayer paid for, like a new Obama phone scam for the general public.
[02:10:56.841 --> 02:10:59.183]  Some of the articles up on InfoWars.com.
[02:10:59.183 --> 02:11:07.508]  Corporate media gossip mongers the death of Putin because he hasn't been in public for six days and canceled some events.
[02:11:07.508 --> 02:11:10.029]  Also, video, cop tries to arrest a dog.
[02:11:10.029 --> 02:11:12.070]  That's on InfoWars.com.
[02:11:12.070 --> 02:11:16.193]  Wu-Tang Clan rapper says Ferguson Police re-put they show.
[02:11:18.468 --> 02:11:19.108]  Well, no.
[02:11:19.108 --> 02:11:24.270]  Even if you thought Brown's shooting was unjustified, it would then be go after that officer, not some random person.
[02:11:24.270 --> 02:11:25.710]  Just unbelievable.
[02:11:25.710 --> 02:11:27.911]  We also have Obama after cop shooting.
[02:11:27.911 --> 02:11:30.572]  Ferguson is worthy of protest.
[02:11:30.572 --> 02:11:32.473]  Is that shooting people?
[02:11:32.473 --> 02:11:35.213]  Hilarious video on a play in overdrive.
[02:11:35.213 --> 02:11:39.595]  Anti-gun group epically fails at mocking Second Amendment.
[02:11:39.595 --> 02:11:40.495]  It is crazy.
[02:11:40.495 --> 02:11:42.236]  People actually think we made it and it's a spoof.
[02:11:42.236 --> 02:11:42.576]  No, it's not.
[02:11:43.656 --> 02:11:43.937]  U.S.
[02:11:43.937 --> 02:11:48.580]  military concerned ISIS fighters returning to the Caribbean could reach border.
[02:11:48.580 --> 02:11:49.461]  Well, there is no border.
[02:11:49.461 --> 02:11:52.944]  So, that's what we're going to be discussing today.
[02:11:52.944 --> 02:11:54.686]  There's so much to go over.
[02:11:54.686 --> 02:11:56.167]  Richard Belzer, let me ask you a question.
[02:11:56.167 --> 02:11:58.369]  Sure.
[02:11:58.369 --> 02:12:04.414]  Why do you think, and the Republicans are backing the FCC grab, the Republican leadership did, so it's bipartisan.
[02:12:04.414 --> 02:12:07.076]  The borders being gotten rid of, executive orders.
[02:12:08.962 --> 02:12:11.623]  All these other power grabs going on.
[02:12:11.623 --> 02:12:21.466]  Government is just, I mean, the Senate committee advanced cyber security bill that's basically SOPA and CISPA together, in secret, won't let the public see the bill.
[02:12:21.466 --> 02:12:25.227]  What's this new, I mean, this new power grab about?
[02:12:25.227 --> 02:12:27.028]  What do you think's happening?
[02:12:27.028 --> 02:12:30.549]  Well, it's the old story of controlling information.
[02:12:30.549 --> 02:12:34.470]  And, you know, it's amazing how they're selling this
[02:12:35.626 --> 02:12:39.474]  Internet bill as a great thing and it's going to open it up.
[02:12:39.474 --> 02:12:46.769]  But as you pointed out, you know, with the Republicans coming on board and business interests in bed with the Justice Department,
[02:12:49.701 --> 02:12:50.582]  We're good to go.
[02:13:16.485 --> 02:13:28.461]  And in the 40s and 50s, the CIA conscripted, so to speak, 5,000 college professors, 400 journalists to manipulate people's minds.
[02:13:28.461 --> 02:13:30.423]  And you know, that still goes on.
[02:13:30.423 --> 02:13:33.207]  I rant about this, but it still goes on to this day.
[02:13:33.977 --> 02:13:35.438]  Sure, and it's illegal.
[02:13:58.677 --> 02:14:13.960]  As you're saying, to have the CIA do that until last year, but Congress, quote, legalized without law, they just said regulators could do this, domestic CIA propaganda in the U.S., so that's why we're seeing such an intensification of disinformation.
[02:14:13.960 --> 02:14:16.181]  We'll put that article on screen, that propaganda.
[02:14:16.181 --> 02:14:17.721]  Yeah, that's an important article.
[02:14:17.721 --> 02:14:18.581]  Yeah.
[02:14:18.581 --> 02:14:20.461]  It's amazing, though, so that's what I'm saying.
[02:14:20.461 --> 02:14:23.202]  Why are the floodgates of tyranny being opened?
[02:14:23.854 --> 02:14:26.156]  Well, I think they're arrogant.
[02:14:26.156 --> 02:14:31.642]  It's like, you know, it's almost like the Leonard Cohen song, you know, the war's over and the good guys are lost.
[02:14:31.642 --> 02:14:34.946]  But there'll always be good guys and we'll never lose.
[02:14:34.946 --> 02:14:37.789]  You know, it's like, you know, you're a Jeffersonian as I am.
[02:14:38.433 --> 02:14:49.259]  You know, it's about... He was into farmers and people who work with their hands and, you know, government was a gentlemanly thing where you went home every weekend and they had other professions.
[02:14:49.259 --> 02:14:50.560]  They were farmers or whatever.
[02:14:50.560 --> 02:14:54.923]  It's not like it is today with this kind of malignant greed.
[02:14:54.923 --> 02:15:00.106]  I just want to read a quick quote to you, which really is telling.
[02:15:00.106 --> 02:15:06.990]  When John Kennedy wanted something to be in the press, he would call a New York Times writer, Arthur Kroc.
[02:15:07.839 --> 02:15:14.250]  So when Arthur Kroc had a piece, he said, you know, a high source in the White House said.
[02:15:14.250 --> 02:15:15.172]  So that would be Kennedy.
[02:15:16.045 --> 02:15:30.851]  And when Kennedy, in 1963, around September, October, Kennedy had given orders, he was pissed off because the CIA went beyond its charter and actually started the war in Vietnam, which, you know, is completely insane.
[02:15:30.851 --> 02:15:39.934]  You know, Kennedy wanted to take the CIA and fold it into the State Department and the Defense Department, you know, have generals kind of take over.
[02:15:40.706 --> 02:15:45.549]  You know, he said that there's a malignancy that the White House could not control.
[02:15:45.549 --> 02:15:48.230]  And this is the quote from Kennedy.
[02:15:48.230 --> 02:15:48.871]  If the U.S.
[02:15:48.871 --> 02:15:54.774]  ever experiences an attempt at a coup to overthrow the government, it will come from the CIA, not the Pentagon.
[02:15:54.774 --> 02:16:00.217]  The agency represents a tremendous power and total unaccountability to anyone.
[02:16:00.217 --> 02:16:02.018]  Six weeks later, they exploded his head.
[02:16:03.752 --> 02:16:08.676]  And you know, these presidents, to me, Alex, are part-time workers.
[02:16:08.676 --> 02:16:11.859]  They come in and they're told, OK, you can do this and you can do that.
[02:16:11.859 --> 02:16:23.448]  Then they show them the Zapruder film, and they say, you know, you can do what you want, but if you cross us, you know, we'll do what they did to... Well, they didn't have to kill Nixon, they just, you know, ruined him in a different way.
[02:16:23.448 --> 02:16:29.794]  They don't have to kill people anymore, they can destroy them, you know, with information that follows information.
[02:16:29.794 --> 02:16:30.474]  I agree.
[02:16:30.474 --> 02:16:32.376]  Where do you think it's all going, this arrogance?
[02:16:33.956 --> 02:16:35.918]  It's all going with what?
[02:16:35.918 --> 02:16:38.440]  Where do you think all this arrogance is leading us?
[02:16:38.440 --> 02:16:39.621]  Well, it's funny.
[02:16:39.621 --> 02:16:44.204]  I think today, about ten years ago, I was with my friend Gore Vidal.
[02:16:44.204 --> 02:16:49.869]  We were going to lunch in Hollywood and he was really angry.
[02:16:49.869 --> 02:16:56.734]  He got in the car and he said, and I don't mean this as a total disrespect because I don't think the American people are stupid.
[02:16:56.734 --> 02:16:58.556]  I think they're ill-informed to a degree.
[02:16:58.556 --> 02:17:01.058]  It's not a question of intelligence.
[02:17:01.058 --> 02:17:03.280]  It's the way information is shaped and presented.
[02:17:04.160 --> 02:17:23.424]  And he said, he was amazed that there wasn't a revolution, a literal revolution, the way the government was, you know, crushing the working class and starting senseless wars and, you know, taking, taxing people to a degree that was, you know, extortion.
[02:17:23.424 --> 02:17:25.325]  And, you know, and he's no raging maniac.
[02:17:25.325 --> 02:17:28.586]  He's, you know, he's one of the smartest people I've ever met.
[02:17:28.586 --> 02:17:29.866]  Alex, I have a question for you.
[02:17:30.746 --> 02:17:31.327]  If I may.
[02:17:31.327 --> 02:17:32.928]  Sure.
[02:17:32.928 --> 02:17:42.255]  The Congress has a 10% approval rating, and 94% of them are re-elected.
[02:17:42.255 --> 02:17:46.719]  I know there's a joke in there somewhere, but... Well, I'll tell you what's happening there.
[02:17:46.719 --> 02:17:52.384]  People like their particular congressperson, or they just vote along party lines.
[02:17:53.536 --> 02:18:05.561]  And so the 8 to 10 percent approval rating that Gallup shows for Congress, the lowest in history in the last six years, is basically a vote against the government itself without politicizing a name.
[02:18:05.561 --> 02:18:19.107]  When it comes to their Republican or Democratic leader, but going back to Gore Vidal, who we interviewed many times, including in person, he was a very, very smart person and exposed false black terror and so much more, but the late Gore Vidal
[02:18:20.117 --> 02:18:24.382]  Was absolutely right that the American people needed to have a, quote, revolution.
[02:18:24.382 --> 02:18:26.004]  I don't even so much get mad at them.
[02:18:26.004 --> 02:18:27.085]  They are in a trance.
[02:18:27.085 --> 02:18:28.407]  They are being brainwashed.
[02:18:28.407 --> 02:18:30.068]  Yes.
[02:18:30.068 --> 02:18:30.649]  Exactly.
[02:18:30.649 --> 02:18:32.411]  That's what I'm thinking.
[02:18:32.411 --> 02:18:40.580]  You know, this has been going on, and so when I say they're arrogant, I mean, they've been going, this has been going on for decades, Alex, and they just keep
[02:18:41.636 --> 02:18:45.621]  Well, there's floating different things that some of them work and some of them don't.
[02:18:45.621 --> 02:18:53.311]  And you were talking about Eddie Bernays a while back, the inventor of public relations.
[02:18:53.311 --> 02:18:54.433]  You know why he was hired?
[02:18:55.568 --> 02:19:12.726]  Initially, because there was a mining disaster that the Rockefellers owned and women and children were slaughtered by the so-called National Guard, which was really working for the Rockefellers, the miners were striking for just decent pay and safety conditions.
[02:19:12.726 --> 02:19:13.927]  That was in Colorado, wasn't it?
[02:19:14.659 --> 02:19:16.040]  No, I think it was in Illinois.
[02:19:16.040 --> 02:19:20.241]  There were a bunch of those there where the Rockefellers had whole mining towns mowed down.
[02:19:20.241 --> 02:19:21.062]  Oh, the Illinois one.
[02:19:21.062 --> 02:19:22.062]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:19:22.062 --> 02:19:22.782]  Yeah, that's the one.
[02:19:22.782 --> 02:19:30.266]  And so Eddie Bernays came in and said, and helped them spin it and say, oh, the people died because a stove tipped over.
[02:19:30.266 --> 02:19:32.286]  And so that was the beginning.
[02:19:32.286 --> 02:19:35.168]  And there was a guy who worked for the Rockefellers.
[02:19:35.168 --> 02:19:36.688]  His name escapes me now.
[02:19:36.688 --> 02:19:38.329]  But he said, look, you guys have a hundred
[02:19:38.969 --> 02:19:41.510]  And this is in the teens, Alex.
[02:19:41.510 --> 02:19:46.472]  You guys have a hundred million dollars there, and the word public relations wasn't around.
[02:19:46.472 --> 02:19:47.212]  Hold on, stay there.
[02:19:47.212 --> 02:19:50.574]  Tell us the public relations propaganda story on the other side.

[02:19:54.455 --> 02:19:57.336]  What really happened with the Malaysian airline flight?
[02:19:57.336 --> 02:19:58.277]  This is really important.
[02:19:58.277 --> 02:19:58.677]  Stay with us.

[02:23:54.958 --> 02:23:55.819]  Kick some ass!
[02:24:13.020 --> 02:24:15.725]  Richard Belzer is our guest.
[02:24:15.725 --> 02:24:19.833]  We were just talking about the arrogance of government and corporations intensifying.
[02:24:21.505 --> 02:24:25.869]  But the ether in which all this corruption grows is that we do have an industrial society.
[02:24:25.869 --> 02:24:30.012]  There's more food, there's more diversions, there's more of a dumbed-down population.
[02:24:30.012 --> 02:24:31.893]  Some of that's our own doing.
[02:24:31.893 --> 02:24:37.238]  And so as we become corrupt and decadent, the elites are given a very, very long leash.
[02:24:37.238 --> 02:24:41.921]  And they're attempting to put us on a leash now, a police state, to protect themselves.
[02:24:42.982 --> 02:24:44.883]  And that's where this whole situation's going.
[02:24:44.883 --> 02:24:49.705]  But you were getting into Edward Bernays and some of the propagandists.
[02:24:49.705 --> 02:24:54.108]  There were Rockefeller exterminations in New Jersey, Illinois, Colorado.
[02:24:54.108 --> 02:25:01.591]  I mean, used to they just sent in Pinkerton security or the army and they would just mow down whole groups of people that didn't... Families.
[02:25:01.591 --> 02:25:02.071]  Yeah.
[02:25:02.071 --> 02:25:03.472]  Ride them down with horses, you name it.
[02:25:03.472 --> 02:25:08.454]  Kind of like the bonus marchers at the end of World War I. But go ahead and break that down.
[02:25:08.454 --> 02:25:11.276]  Well, you know, you were talking about women's health before.
[02:25:12.243 --> 02:25:23.611]  And the tobacco industry was his client, and they wanted to figure out how to sell cigarettes to women, because it wasn't cool for women to smoke in the early 20s or late teens.
[02:25:23.611 --> 02:25:25.452]  I think it was the early 20s.
[02:25:25.452 --> 02:25:36.620]  So Bernays got a bunch of debutantes and girls, college girls, whatever, to go to Times Square and light up a cigarette, and they called it Torches of Freedom.
[02:25:37.140 --> 02:25:40.804]  And they likened it to women's equality.
[02:25:40.804 --> 02:25:44.987]  So it's like the women's movement started with cancer.
[02:25:44.987 --> 02:25:58.480]  I mean, millions of women have gotten emphysema and lung cancer because Eddie Bernays and the tobacco industry glamorized cigarettes and made them a symbol, calling them torches of freedom, torches of death.
[02:25:58.480 --> 02:26:01.863]  Well Richard, that's a microcosm of everything the globalists do.
[02:26:01.863 --> 02:26:02.823]  They take legitimate
[02:26:03.681 --> 02:26:06.984]  Civil rights movements, cultural movements, you name it.
[02:26:06.984 --> 02:26:15.312]  And then they attach their people to it, to then Pied Piper lead the group, when what they really want to do is enslave them.
[02:26:15.312 --> 02:26:17.273]  And that's why the CIA founded Ms.
[02:26:17.273 --> 02:26:22.658]  Magazine and Gloria Steinem on record, not to empower women, but to break up families.
[02:26:22.658 --> 02:26:24.120]  CIA, by the way, you know that.
[02:26:24.120 --> 02:26:25.761]  Absolutely, CIA.
[02:26:25.761 --> 02:26:27.503]  And that's declassified.
[02:26:27.503 --> 02:26:29.805]  So how do we navigate something like this?
[02:26:30.566 --> 02:26:39.193]  Well, you know, I think, thank God, you know, for you and people like George Norrie and others who are open to these ideas.
[02:26:39.193 --> 02:26:50.863]  And the thing is that millions of people are with us, Alex, and it's just that you don't see it on the front page of the corporate press because they're terrified of people getting information.
[02:26:50.863 --> 02:26:53.326]  That's why they try to doctor information.
[02:26:53.326 --> 02:26:56.088]  But, you know, 1984 goes both ways, Alex.
[02:26:56.088 --> 02:26:58.110]  They can watch us, but now we're watching them.
[02:26:58.770 --> 02:27:04.072]  And we can expose things sooner than ever before and just keep hitting the nail on the head.
[02:27:04.072 --> 02:27:06.613]  I mean, it's like the myth of Sisyphus.
[02:27:06.613 --> 02:27:11.635]  You know, he rolled the rock up to the top of the hill only for it to fall down the other side.
[02:27:11.635 --> 02:27:16.417]  But in his mind, it was the triumph of getting the rock up there, not the futility of it.
[02:27:16.417 --> 02:27:26.741]  I don't want to get too esoteric, but I think there's a lot of brave, smart people in America with big hearts who are angry, confused, and disinformed.
[02:27:28.706 --> 02:27:30.727]  You know, we've got to stick together.
[02:27:30.727 --> 02:27:41.152]  And the thing in the shooting of those police officers, you know, this is a classic.
[02:27:41.152 --> 02:27:45.615]  You remember Operation Paperclip where we imported Nazis?
[02:27:45.615 --> 02:27:49.657]  Part of those Nazis that we got out of Nuremberg,
[02:27:51.098 --> 02:28:02.684]  We're propaganda experts, and they counsel people in our government to keep racial strife going, because when you divide people you can control them better.
[02:28:02.684 --> 02:28:15.651]  Race relations could have probably gotten along much quicker than they have, and there's still queer serious problems, but there are forces at work that keep this in play, and that just kills me.
[02:28:15.651 --> 02:28:16.412]  It breaks my heart.
[02:28:17.112 --> 02:28:18.053]  No, that's not true, by the way.
[02:28:32.783 --> 02:28:33.804]  It was unwitting.
[02:28:33.804 --> 02:28:38.147]  I mean, you can criticize him, but that's not a fair accusation.
[02:28:38.147 --> 02:28:39.749]  I study this quite deeply.
[02:28:39.749 --> 02:28:50.997]  Well, I want to debate that with you because I saw him on 60 Minutes say that he's not ashamed of what he did because it helped him survive and that he'd have been killed if he didn't help round up people.
[02:28:50.997 --> 02:28:54.620]  Well, I mean, if somebody stuck a gun to my head and said, round up people, I'd say pull the trigger.
[02:28:56.198 --> 02:28:58.320]  Well, yeah, you have a point.
[02:28:58.320 --> 02:28:58.881]  You have a point.
[02:28:58.881 --> 02:29:00.943]  I mean, see, that's all esoteric arguments.
[02:29:00.943 --> 02:29:02.404]  What happened, he was a kid.
[02:29:02.404 --> 02:29:03.165]  He was a little kid.
[02:29:03.165 --> 02:29:04.726]  Yeah, he was like 14.
[02:29:04.726 --> 02:29:09.971]  Yeah, well, you can be terrified when you're 14, but you and I have much more fruitful things to discuss.
[02:29:09.971 --> 02:29:13.775]  No, no, I hear you, but then why would George Soros, the guy that funds so much of the left wing,
[02:29:14.395 --> 02:29:23.940]  Why would he, the fake left wing, just like Edward Bernays led the fake women's movement to control it, why then would he spend 30 plus million dollars to help stir up the Ferguson stuff?
[02:29:23.940 --> 02:29:28.303]  Because it's a distraction from the fact that Obama has... What are you spending the money on, Alex?
[02:29:28.303 --> 02:29:29.844]  Do what, sir?
[02:29:29.844 --> 02:29:31.245]  Where's that money going?
[02:29:31.245 --> 02:29:33.406]  It's going to just foam it and stir stuff up.
[02:29:34.531 --> 02:29:37.654]  I don't want to go too far with it, but let's get your comment on Soros on the other side.
[02:29:37.654 --> 02:29:39.916]  Then let's shift gears into the big mystery.
[02:29:39.916 --> 02:29:44.420]  Someone is hiding something in the new book by Richard Belzer, George Norrie, and David Wayne.
[02:29:44.420 --> 02:29:48.764]  I can't wait to read it because I know these guys have done the research and it's got a bunch of photos and documents.
[02:29:48.764 --> 02:29:50.166]  We're on the march.
[02:29:50.166 --> 02:29:52.688]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:52.688 --> 02:29:55.371]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[02:31:19.063 --> 02:31:21.985]  Many herbal colon cleansers are harsh on the body,
[02:31:22.185 --> 02:31:22.626]  I think?
[02:31:37.142 --> 02:31:37.402]  We're good.

[02:33:15.441 --> 02:33:17.563]  By the way, I was just talking to Richard Belzer during the break.
[02:33:17.563 --> 02:33:20.786]  He was not being an apologist for George Soros.
[02:33:20.786 --> 02:33:23.408]  He's just as sick of all the divide and conquer stuff.
[02:33:23.408 --> 02:33:30.675]  He was mentioning to me, and I've forgotten this, the report last year on extremists by the Southern Poverty Law Center that's really discredited its mandate.
[02:33:31.275 --> 02:33:36.201]  And they had myself and Richard Belzer in there as extremists with a huge swastika above us.
[02:33:36.201 --> 02:33:38.263]  And they mail these out to prominent people.
[02:33:38.263 --> 02:33:40.566]  My dad gets them in the mail.
[02:33:40.566 --> 02:33:41.226]  Magazine.
[02:33:41.226 --> 02:33:43.469]  And there it is.
[02:33:43.469 --> 02:33:44.851]  Southern Poverty Law Center.
[02:33:44.851 --> 02:33:45.631]  Richard Belzer.
[02:33:46.772 --> 02:33:49.794]  And then in the print edition, they had a swastika on the page.
[02:33:49.794 --> 02:33:59.020]  Of course, Belzer's Jewish, but we were mentioning Cross, the comedian, put out a movie where they have a guy and they're saying, I hate black people and Jews.
[02:33:59.020 --> 02:34:00.081]  I learned it from Alex Jones.
[02:34:00.081 --> 02:34:02.922]  And Belzer had some words to say about that.
[02:34:02.922 --> 02:34:06.084]  So, I mean, they're definitely trying to get everybody fighting with each other.
[02:34:06.084 --> 02:34:07.505]  What do you think's going on here?
[02:34:07.505 --> 02:34:12.528]  I mean, they had us right next to each other in the Southern Property Law Center.
[02:34:12.528 --> 02:34:13.349]  What do you make of this?
[02:34:14.215 --> 02:34:23.059]  Well, I think that, you know, this has been, as you know, as well as anyone, marginalized people that question the status quo.
[02:34:23.059 --> 02:34:24.800]  Marginalize them.
[02:34:24.800 --> 02:34:30.782]  You know, when fascists come in and take over a country, they kill the professors, the artists, the students, you know what I mean?
[02:34:30.782 --> 02:34:36.025]  There's a thing that's well known in the fascist circles is that
[02:34:37.085 --> 02:34:41.547]  You have to kill all the smart people first and then you can control things.
[02:34:41.547 --> 02:34:51.712]  So the fact that you are so incendiary and 90% of what you say, as you say, your research is impeccable.
[02:34:51.712 --> 02:34:54.913]  So even if you disagree, how do you disagree with the truth?
[02:34:55.553 --> 02:35:06.543]  So, you know, there's been a lot of psychological tests about people who, when they're presented with something that threatens their perception of the world, they get very defensive and they lash out and they don't try to reason.
[02:35:06.543 --> 02:35:08.564]  And I think a lot of that is going on.
[02:35:08.564 --> 02:35:20.154]  I think the government is smart enough to know about what parts of the brain, literally, can be triggered to make people either submissive or contentious or distrust another ethnic group.
[02:35:20.154 --> 02:35:23.397]  I mean, you know, they play people like a record.
[02:35:24.157 --> 02:35:39.660]  And, you know, so you and I and others, not that I'm in your company, but... Oh, but you're doing a great job, and that's why they put us together in this report of 50 people next to David Duke and all the rest of these folks, because we dare, they say, we dare question the Kennedy assassination.
[02:35:39.660 --> 02:35:43.621]  I mean, in national polls, upwards of 90% don't believe the official story.
[02:35:43.621 --> 02:35:44.241]  Are 90% Nazis?
[02:35:44.241 --> 02:35:50.602]  Yeah, well... I mean, you write books exposing the Nazis, and so you're now a Nazi.
[02:35:50.602 --> 02:35:52.763]  I mean, this is... or you're now in with Nazis.
[02:35:52.763 --> 02:35:53.383]  This is crazy.
[02:35:54.033 --> 02:35:59.614]  It is crazy, and 90% of the people believe that Kennedy was killed by a conspiracy.
[02:35:59.614 --> 02:36:02.955]  The other 10% vote for the press or the government.
[02:36:02.955 --> 02:36:04.095]  Exactly.
[02:36:04.095 --> 02:36:09.497]  I think it's a badge of honor, and I think they've overused this race card stuff so much.
[02:36:09.497 --> 02:36:10.897]  It's disgusting!
[02:36:10.897 --> 02:36:11.877]  It doesn't work anymore.
[02:36:11.877 --> 02:36:17.358]  My problem is, now there are legitimate, really hateful people out there who deserve to be criticized.
[02:36:17.358 --> 02:36:23.420]  Now it actually gives them cover because the ADL and Southern Poverty Law Center just attack all these innocent people.
[02:36:25.242 --> 02:36:33.995]  Yeah, and you know, I was stopped in the street in New York by someone, a well-dressed gentleman, and said, I saw that article, you know, it's like, you know, give me a break.
[02:36:36.124 --> 02:36:41.705]  It's like you did something wrong to question Kennedy assassinations, so now you're mixed in with neo-Nazis.
[02:36:41.705 --> 02:36:42.446]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:36:42.446 --> 02:36:45.086]  I mean, there's not even any logic to it.
[02:36:45.086 --> 02:36:49.227]  But they keep throwing this stuff out there, you know, like this war on terror is such a joke.
[02:36:49.227 --> 02:36:58.810]  I just read that a top member of the jihadist group that the government and NATO armed and funded in the overthrow of Gaddafi, now he's in charge of ISIS.
[02:36:58.810 --> 02:36:59.230]  That's right.
[02:36:59.830 --> 02:37:00.230]  That's right.
[02:37:00.230 --> 02:37:02.212]  Somebody we created is now in charge.
[02:37:02.212 --> 02:37:03.733]  That's an admitted fact.
[02:37:03.733 --> 02:37:06.094]  And now they say that they're in the Caribbean and may come up here.
[02:37:06.094 --> 02:37:11.297]  And when stuff gets blown up, God forbid, then they'll take more of our liberties and pose as saviors.
[02:37:11.297 --> 02:37:12.138]  It's really simple.
[02:37:12.138 --> 02:37:13.659]  Let's get into your book.
[02:37:13.659 --> 02:37:16.781]  They'll blow something up and blame them.
[02:37:16.781 --> 02:37:17.301]  Exactly.
[02:37:17.301 --> 02:37:17.782]  Either or.
[02:37:17.782 --> 02:37:19.363]  It's still a false flag.
[02:37:19.363 --> 02:37:19.823]  Exactly.
[02:37:20.503 --> 02:37:21.885]  Someone is hiding something.
[02:37:21.885 --> 02:37:24.407]  What happened to Malaysian Airlines Flight 370?
[02:37:24.407 --> 02:37:25.108]  You've got maps.
[02:37:25.108 --> 02:37:26.690]  You've got graphs.
[02:37:26.690 --> 02:37:29.873]  You worked with George Norrie and David Wayne on this.
[02:37:29.873 --> 02:37:32.015]  New York Times best-selling authors.
[02:37:32.015 --> 02:37:33.817]  The book's available at Amazon and everywhere else.
[02:37:33.817 --> 02:37:34.658]  We're not selling it yet.
[02:37:34.658 --> 02:37:35.579]  We should be.
[02:37:35.579 --> 02:37:39.903]  Please do.
[02:37:39.903 --> 02:37:40.844]  Tell us about the book.
[02:37:40.844 --> 02:37:43.327]  I mean, let's go to the highlights of it and why it's so important.
[02:37:44.156 --> 02:37:57.170]  Well, you know, it's an incredible mystery that, once again, it's an event where they insult the intelligence of everyone and put out their version, you know, of what they think it should be.
[02:37:57.170 --> 02:37:59.092]  And there's so many things about it.
[02:37:59.092 --> 02:38:03.017]  You know, first of all, a play that size has a million pieces to it.
[02:38:03.955 --> 02:38:09.836]  And people wonder, you know, can a plane totally disappear in this day and age?
[02:38:09.836 --> 02:38:10.756]  Can it be lost?
[02:38:10.756 --> 02:38:12.456]  And the answer is no.
[02:38:12.456 --> 02:38:14.597]  There are way too many systems at work.
[02:38:14.597 --> 02:38:17.477]  You know, even the backup systems have backup systems.
[02:38:17.477 --> 02:38:21.618]  Military radar would have picked up the flight if it was still airborne.
[02:38:21.618 --> 02:38:24.118]  The black boxes have transmitters.
[02:38:24.118 --> 02:38:32.280]  And another thing that I don't see much in the press, but in our book about military operations going on in the area, does that sound familiar?
[02:38:33.894 --> 02:38:39.599]  Where, you know, during a military operation, there have been accidental shoot-downs, as you know.
[02:38:39.599 --> 02:38:40.900]  Yes, and, you know, 9-11, there was a big operation going on.
[02:38:40.900 --> 02:38:43.382]  Remember the guy said, is this real?
[02:38:52.711 --> 02:38:56.073]  Yeah, is this real and part of the ongoing simulation?
[02:38:56.073 --> 02:39:06.340]  The exact trains and the exact bus at the exact time, and then they admitted it on the BBC that they ran the drill with Scotland Yard at the same time.
[02:39:06.340 --> 02:39:06.600]  Impossible!
[02:39:15.543 --> 02:39:18.706]  Yeah, and that's why I say it's so insulting.
[02:39:18.706 --> 02:39:26.293]  And you know, on the plane, there were men, speaking of the Twin Towers, you know the Petronas Towers?
[02:39:26.293 --> 02:39:35.861]  In Kuala Lumpur, there was a feeling that that plane was hijacked to go hit that, like the Twin Towers.
[02:39:38.831 --> 02:39:40.832]  Well, I don't know.
[02:39:40.832 --> 02:39:42.233]  You've researched this in-depth.
[02:39:42.233 --> 02:39:44.595]  My listeners are always asking my opinion of it.
[02:39:44.595 --> 02:39:50.819]  Some people think it was diverted to Diego Garcia or shot down.
[02:39:50.819 --> 02:39:52.100]  Is that a parrot in the background?
[02:39:52.100 --> 02:39:55.263]  Hold on a second.
[02:39:55.263 --> 02:39:57.664]  Or is that dogs fighting?
[02:39:57.664 --> 02:39:58.745]  It's kind of like, what is it?
[02:39:58.745 --> 02:40:00.106]  Five dogs, I'm sorry.
[02:40:00.106 --> 02:40:00.646]  No, it's alright.
[02:40:00.646 --> 02:40:01.267]  I know how it is.
[02:40:01.267 --> 02:40:02.167]  I've got dogs as well.
[02:40:02.167 --> 02:40:05.330]  Oh my God, Deanie.
[02:40:05.330 --> 02:40:07.931]  You okay, honey?
[02:40:07.931 --> 02:40:08.472]  Oh no.
[02:40:09.309 --> 02:40:12.492]  Oh my God, and none of it.
[02:40:12.492 --> 02:40:15.774]  That is not the biggest crime in this house.
[02:40:15.774 --> 02:40:17.195]  Anyway.
[02:40:17.195 --> 02:40:24.361]  Also, um, the plane was near Diego Garcia, which is, you know, bigger than Area 51.
[02:40:24.361 --> 02:40:32.988]  And that's where they rendered people, and there's submarine bases there, and if there was a plane missing, you know they'd send up something to check it out, right?
[02:40:34.093 --> 02:40:41.544]  So let me ask you this question, from all the different theories that you cover in the book, go over some of the main theories, and then what you think happened.
[02:40:41.544 --> 02:40:47.013]  Well, um, you know, the pilot was simulating landing at
[02:40:48.089 --> 02:40:49.030]  What about a brain heist?
[02:40:49.030 --> 02:40:51.691]  Because there was a bunch of people on board, right?
[02:41:10.879 --> 02:41:11.779]  A brain heist.
[02:41:11.779 --> 02:41:13.280]  A bunch of scientists were on board.
[02:41:13.280 --> 02:41:15.641]  Could it have been a brain heist of some type of government?
[02:41:15.641 --> 02:41:16.661]  Yeah, no, that's a good point.
[02:41:16.661 --> 02:41:26.124]  There were like, I think, 14 people that were experts in this device used by the military that was, you know, very, very valuable.
[02:41:26.124 --> 02:41:30.726]  And they had, between them, the brain trust, you know, had all the knowledge.
[02:41:31.466 --> 02:41:32.086]  I don't think so.
[02:41:51.838 --> 02:41:52.538]  Knowingly.
[02:41:52.538 --> 02:41:54.579]  So that's very strange.
[02:41:54.579 --> 02:42:07.386]  My feeling is that if I had to be pushed on it, I'd say the plane was commandeered because we know that you can hijack a plane from the ground.
[02:42:07.386 --> 02:42:09.427]  Been able to do that for a long time.
[02:42:10.852 --> 02:42:14.614]  Uh, they killed my friend by hijacking his Mercedes and smashing it to a tree.
[02:42:14.614 --> 02:42:15.515]  Remember, Hastings?
[02:42:15.515 --> 02:42:16.155]  Yes.
[02:42:16.155 --> 02:42:18.696]  So they can hijack these planes from the ground.
[02:42:18.696 --> 02:42:22.338]  I think they probably landed it at that base.
[02:42:22.338 --> 02:42:28.281]  And, uh, like you say, commandeer the brain trust and keep that plane there for future use.
[02:42:29.019 --> 02:42:32.162]  That's my theory, I don't, you know.
[02:42:32.162 --> 02:42:40.690]  Well that's my theory, and I haven't even read your book yet, that it was diverted, the pilot was involved, the double agent, they told him the plane was... He and I have been involved.
[02:42:41.684 --> 02:42:43.584]  Well, I'm not saying he was.
[02:42:43.584 --> 02:42:46.845]  I'm saying he could have been involved since that was on his home computer.
[02:42:46.845 --> 02:42:50.226]  And then they basically tell everybody the plane's been hijacked, it lands.
[02:42:50.226 --> 02:42:53.086]  And then they basically take everybody into custody, black bag them.
[02:42:53.086 --> 02:43:00.327]  Because we know under Operation Northwood they talk about putting, you know, CIA people with fake names on board aircraft, diverting it, crashing another one.
[02:43:00.327 --> 02:43:02.068]  I mean, they've done stuff like this before.
[02:43:02.068 --> 02:43:03.648]  That's right.
[02:43:03.648 --> 02:43:08.169]  And there are two guys on the plane who's had fake passports and they said, oh no, don't worry about it.
[02:43:09.366 --> 02:43:11.453]  Yeah, just like happened with the underwear bomber.
[02:43:11.453 --> 02:43:12.175]  Let me ask you this.
[02:43:13.331 --> 02:43:20.113]  What do you make of its sister plane, same make, model, being the one that gets shot down over Russia, and then another plane out of Malaysia goes down.
[02:43:20.113 --> 02:43:24.874]  I mean, there's hundreds of different airlines in the world, hundreds of air forces.
[02:43:24.874 --> 02:43:26.575]  What's going on with these Malaysian airlines?
[02:43:26.575 --> 02:43:28.435]  Yeah, the odds of that.
[02:43:28.435 --> 02:43:31.176]  There are people that make a connection between the two flights.
[02:43:31.176 --> 02:43:39.778]  There's some serious, you know, writers that we've looked at and we talk about in the book that say there's a definite connection between the two aircraft.
[02:43:39.778 --> 02:43:41.739]  But I'm at a loss as to know
[02:43:42.859 --> 02:43:48.823]  I'm just fearful that one is going to be used for something.
[02:43:48.823 --> 02:43:51.344]  That's my fear.
[02:43:51.344 --> 02:43:54.046]  That aircraft that was at that base.
[02:43:54.046 --> 02:43:57.308]  I don't know for what, but Northwoods comes to mind.
[02:43:59.537 --> 02:44:01.758]  Well, I tell you, it's an important book.
[02:44:01.758 --> 02:44:11.680]  People are really obsessed over this, and I'm glad you've written a book about it, because if they can just start disappearing airplanes... I know one of the theories is that it could have been a dimensional time warp.
[02:44:11.680 --> 02:44:14.401]  I don't get into that stuff, but could have been space aliens.
[02:44:14.401 --> 02:44:22.783]  I mean, I think it's a lot easier to believe that it was diverted to Diego Garcia, because this is an area of the world pretty much in control of the U.S.
[02:44:23.732 --> 02:44:24.312]  What do you say?
[02:44:24.312 --> 02:44:28.454]  I mean, there is a chapter on other dimensions.
[02:44:28.454 --> 02:44:33.315]  Because, you know, there are people who seriously get into that stuff.
[02:44:33.315 --> 02:44:38.517]  I know it's been laughed out of the room, but I mean, I don't think it was an interdimensional event.
[02:44:38.517 --> 02:44:41.378]  But, you know, I wouldn't be shocked if it was.
[02:44:41.378 --> 02:44:44.559]  Well, I wonder if... Nothing surprises me.
[02:44:44.559 --> 02:44:48.420]  I wonder if the Southern Poverty Law Center
[02:44:50.754 --> 02:45:03.254]  Will attack you or George Norrie for daring to write a book questioning what happened to the plane because it appears being a conspiracy theory just means you question mysteries or you don't believe known liars.
[02:45:03.254 --> 02:45:05.657]  What do you make of the conspiracy theory label?
[02:45:06.713 --> 02:45:10.295]  Well, it's another way of marginalizing, you know.
[02:45:10.295 --> 02:45:12.636]  The founding of this country was a conspiracy.
[02:45:12.636 --> 02:45:17.959]  I mean, it's just, you know, it means to breathe together.
[02:45:17.959 --> 02:45:20.300]  Two people have an idea and they do.
[02:45:20.300 --> 02:45:28.124]  It's been so marginalized and it's so jokingly, still to this day, you know, very smart people that I know,
[02:45:28.905 --> 02:45:33.751]  Just, you know, scoff and raise their eyebrows at a lot of this stuff.
[02:45:33.751 --> 02:45:41.241]  And that's another thing that fascinates me about the way people's brains work and what highly intelligent people cannot accept reality.
[02:45:41.241 --> 02:45:43.384]  You know, that's really disturbing.
[02:45:45.109 --> 02:45:58.312]  It's like, uh, I've had discussions with, really, I mean, I don't want to drop any names, but, you know, some of the brightest people in the world who won't believe some basic facts, even when they're laid out to them.
[02:45:58.312 --> 02:46:01.413]  So to me, it's nothing to do with intelligence.
[02:46:01.413 --> 02:46:07.375]  It's an emotional level that the government has somehow figured out how to play that string, make us fearful, etc.
[02:46:08.735 --> 02:46:10.036]  Well, take Vivian Kubrick.
[02:46:10.036 --> 02:46:12.396]  You know, hadn't done but like two interviews in 15 years.
[02:46:12.396 --> 02:46:13.377]  She's a listener.
[02:46:13.377 --> 02:46:15.118]  We've interviewed her on radio and in person.
[02:46:15.118 --> 02:46:18.779]  Stanley Kubrick's daughter, who was his protégé, you know, a comedy filmmaker.
[02:46:18.779 --> 02:46:20.079]  He was a genius.
[02:46:20.079 --> 02:46:21.000]  Absolutely.
[02:46:21.000 --> 02:46:25.081]  They made a joke about General Jack T. Ripper not wanting fluoridation, but I've talked to her.
[02:46:25.081 --> 02:46:26.002]  She knows fluoride's bad.
[02:46:26.522 --> 02:46:37.415]  What are they going to do as Newsweek, the London Guardian, the British medical science, you know, government, admit, okay, fluoride's brain damaging people, causing thyroid problems and obesity.
[02:46:37.415 --> 02:46:39.738]  That's the classic kook thing.
[02:46:39.738 --> 02:46:43.142]  That's being admitted now.
[02:46:43.142 --> 02:46:45.005]  Precious bodily fluids, Mandrake!
[02:46:45.405 --> 02:46:45.845]  Exactly.
[02:46:45.845 --> 02:46:48.687]  There's plans to even fluoridate ice cream.
[02:46:48.687 --> 02:47:01.396]  I remember when they started, this is how old I am, when fluoridation came in and there was, you know, people were terrified of it because they thought it was communist or something.
[02:47:01.396 --> 02:47:08.541]  But, you know, as you know better than anyone, fluoride is a waste material that they couldn't figure out what to do with it.
[02:47:08.541 --> 02:47:11.523]  And it does affect, you know, brains of people and
[02:47:12.815 --> 02:47:23.538]  That's another thing I appreciate what you do about health issues because you know people are inundated with commercials on television for products that'll kill them.
[02:47:23.538 --> 02:47:30.400]  Well I mean I got really unhealthy about 10 years ago from not caring so that's why I researched it more and wasn't even following my own advice.
[02:47:30.400 --> 02:47:33.761]  I've gotten a little bit healthier, a lot healthier getting away from some of this stuff.
[02:47:34.501 --> 02:47:35.542]  Oh, you're a sweetheart.
[02:47:35.542 --> 02:47:39.886]  You know, I want to ask you this question because the article just went up on InfoWars.com.
[02:47:39.886 --> 02:47:43.169]  It's got my video from the first part of the show where I break it down.
[02:47:43.169 --> 02:47:45.171]  We need this to go mega viral, folks.
[02:47:45.171 --> 02:47:52.077]  The FCC held back their regulations for two weeks and one day so that they could put out the lie they were protecting the web.
[02:47:52.077 --> 02:47:55.401]  I've been under FCC regulation for 20 years being a talk show host.
[02:47:55.401 --> 02:47:56.802]  I've had to go to legal seminars.
[02:47:57.222 --> 02:47:59.424]  I've seen FCC complaints come in.
[02:47:59.424 --> 02:48:00.926]  I've had them done on me.
[02:48:00.926 --> 02:48:02.127]  I've been on Howard Stern.
[02:48:02.127 --> 02:48:03.489]  You know what he's been through.
[02:48:03.489 --> 02:48:09.154]  Regardless, they use it to tax and control and only give big corporations the airwaves.
[02:48:09.154 --> 02:48:12.277]  Big corporations couldn't take over the web, so they have the FCC.
[02:48:14.414 --> 02:48:20.977]  They had the FCC basically come in, claiming to protect it and grab it.
[02:48:20.977 --> 02:48:32.022]  Now they're going to have a big legal fight, the corporations will write the new regs, but they say they're going to apply the stuff they've done with television onto cable and internet now with criminal enforcement.
[02:48:32.022 --> 02:48:34.943]  So I'm here to tell you... What does that mean, criminal enforcement?
[02:48:35.603 --> 02:48:42.008]  It means they're going to use their FCC offices and referral to the Justice Department under the FCC.
[02:48:42.008 --> 02:48:46.511]  I mean, I went over the subsections in the first hour, which nobody else is doing.
[02:48:46.511 --> 02:48:48.212]  This is really bad.
[02:48:48.212 --> 02:48:52.435]  The article is on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[02:48:52.435 --> 02:48:54.316]  What do you make of this whole debate in general?
[02:48:55.532 --> 02:49:03.174]  Well, you know, this is the Orwellian nightmare that we've all... It's just another... I don't want to say incremental, because it's a big step.
[02:49:03.174 --> 02:49:07.715]  It's just another way of controlling information.
[02:49:07.715 --> 02:49:14.037]  And, you know, it's chilling, because it's being sold on the guise of, oh, the Internet's going to be okay now.
[02:49:14.037 --> 02:49:23.079]  You know, that's what I mean about how they sculpt reality and make it palatable to people when it's really against their best interests.
[02:49:24.048 --> 02:49:30.502]  Which is another thing that fascinates me, how people will vote against their own best interests because of some social issue.
[02:49:32.830 --> 02:49:35.372]  Well, I tell you, people better get on this issue.
[02:49:35.372 --> 02:49:37.954]  You know, it's super technical.
[02:49:37.954 --> 02:49:45.719]  Kit did a great job writing this article fast off my notes and off the documents, but he has headline, FCC to seize cable TV, radio, and broadband.
[02:49:45.719 --> 02:49:46.960]  That would be internet radio.
[02:49:46.960 --> 02:49:47.981]  That's the headline?
[02:49:47.981 --> 02:49:50.302]  Yes, but I mean... That's a good headline.
[02:49:50.302 --> 02:49:52.684]  Yeah, but I really think, you know, it's official.
[02:49:52.684 --> 02:49:57.427]  FCC to seize entire internet cable spectrum.
[02:49:57.427 --> 02:49:59.549]  Apply broadcast rules to the web.
[02:50:00.442 --> 02:50:06.927]  So they're going to further control the issuance of licenses and what is allowed to be said and done on the air?
[02:50:06.927 --> 02:50:09.529]  Exactly what Mark Cuban warned of a few weeks ago.
[02:50:09.529 --> 02:50:12.991]  He said, say goodbye to cable as you know it.
[02:50:12.991 --> 02:50:14.032]  So great job, Kit.
[02:50:14.032 --> 02:50:14.813]  And it's not Kit's fault.
[02:50:14.813 --> 02:50:16.214]  I don't know how to write this headline.
[02:50:16.214 --> 02:50:17.475]  Because I'm sitting here with you, Richard.
[02:50:17.475 --> 02:50:18.575]  I don't know how to write it.
[02:50:18.575 --> 02:50:27.162]  I mean, it applies broadcast UHF, VHF, AM, FM, shortwave rules to all telecommunications and all internet.
[02:50:28.354 --> 02:50:31.020]  Uh, and has criminal penalties.
[02:50:31.020 --> 02:50:35.208]  I'm gonna try to figure out the headline and- FCC celebrates Big Brother wins.
[02:50:36.704 --> 02:50:39.926]  Yeah, I mean, it's just incredible.
[02:50:39.926 --> 02:50:42.287]  The article's on Infowars.com, red-linked.
[02:50:42.287 --> 02:50:43.628]  Get it out to everyone you know.
[02:50:43.628 --> 02:50:49.472]  The video in it breaks it all down, and I show each subsection in the video.
[02:50:49.472 --> 02:50:53.694]  We need to get this out now so folks understand early on in the debate what this is really about.
[02:50:53.694 --> 02:50:54.915]  They're two weeks ahead of us.
[02:50:54.915 --> 02:50:56.196]  We gotta catch up on them.
[02:50:56.196 --> 02:50:57.256]  Richard Belzer's our guest.
[02:50:57.256 --> 02:50:57.917]  The new book's out.
[02:50:59.859 --> 02:51:01.019]  It's happening again.
[02:51:01.019 --> 02:51:04.641]  The Feds are trying to ban your freedom to own body armor.
[02:51:04.641 --> 02:51:07.822]  In January, a newly introduced bill, H.R.
[02:51:07.822 --> 02:51:12.123]  378, will take away your right to buy level 3 and higher body armor.
[02:51:12.123 --> 02:51:17.605]  KD Armor offers the most affordable level 3 body armor packages on the market today.
[02:51:17.605 --> 02:51:18.726]  Protect yourself.
[02:51:18.726 --> 02:51:21.807]  Buy your body armor now, before it's too late.
[02:51:21.807 --> 02:51:23.527]  Go to KDArmor.com.

[02:51:58.803 --> 02:52:01.705]  What good is a Big Berkey Water Filter?

[02:53:01.835 --> 02:53:05.157]  This is Alice from New Jersey.
[02:53:05.157 --> 02:53:08.338]  I still get angina, even with four stents.
[02:53:08.338 --> 02:53:11.260]  I was taking nitro two or three times a week.
[02:53:11.260 --> 02:53:16.282]  The very first day after taking Heart and Body Extract, the chest pain was gone.
[02:53:16.282 --> 02:53:18.243]  Now I don't wear a nitro patch.

[02:54:18.127 --> 02:54:21.849]  The system does not like this open, free speech without a bunch of labels.
[02:54:21.849 --> 02:54:23.090]  Just call it like it is.
[02:54:23.090 --> 02:54:24.551]  Tyranny versus freedom.
[02:54:25.384 --> 02:54:26.425]  They try to confuse it.
[02:54:26.425 --> 02:54:27.767]  They try to create division.
[02:54:27.767 --> 02:54:34.234]  And the corporate anti-free market forces that are out there are really consolidating control right now.
[02:54:34.234 --> 02:54:36.317]  The article is up on InfoWars.com.
[02:54:36.317 --> 02:54:39.300]  The FCC power grab is confirmed.
[02:54:39.300 --> 02:54:41.062]  It is a total takeover of the entire
[02:54:41.963 --> 02:54:47.927]  Internet broadband spectrum applying Broadcast rules basically and criminal penalties.
[02:54:47.927 --> 02:54:49.328]  I mean, there's your headline.
[02:54:49.328 --> 02:54:54.431]  I don't know what you call the video FCC takeover internet confirmed.
[02:54:54.431 --> 02:55:00.876]  I mean, it's it's it's bad I only read probably 30 pages of the 400 pages a day the key sections.
[02:55:00.876 --> 02:55:05.739]  I'm gonna be reading more We'll have more tonight on the nightly news seven o'clock central Richard Belzer is our guest.
[02:55:05.739 --> 02:55:10.862]  We'll have him back in a few weeks maybe with George Norey the two together and then open the phones up about
[02:55:12.043 --> 02:55:15.586]  This issue, and a lot more, the Malaysian Airlines situation.
[02:55:15.586 --> 02:55:20.230]  The new book is available everywhere, except in FullRestore.com.
[02:55:20.230 --> 02:55:22.372]  We're going to try to get that set up soon.
[02:55:22.372 --> 02:55:25.434]  Richard Belzer, George Norris, someone is hiding something.
[02:55:25.434 --> 02:55:29.037]  What happened to Malaysian Airlines Flight 370?
[02:55:29.037 --> 02:55:36.043]  In closing comments, anything else you'd like to add, Richard, concerning the flight?
[02:55:38.220 --> 02:55:47.468]  Well, the powers that be seem to be a lot more comfortable with just closing the door and moving on, you know, whatever their plans are on the whole geopolitical chess game.
[02:55:47.468 --> 02:55:50.791]  But we get glimpses of the truth, but really the whole story.
[02:55:50.791 --> 02:56:02.081]  I think that's why, you know, people, to be a citizen today, you have to kind of work at getting full disclosure and finding out what's really going.
[02:56:02.081 --> 02:56:03.243]  And I would say
[02:56:04.712 --> 02:56:27.040]  Every newspaper headline in the corporate press is suspect and that every threat should be looked at and not immediately be relentless to the fear factor and know that the agenda of the ruler in class, so-called, is to keep us at each other's throats and to control what information we get.
[02:56:27.040 --> 02:56:33.443]  So the better we get along and the more we learn, we can live up to the Jeffersonian ideal.
[02:56:34.537 --> 02:56:36.759]  Well, I love the Jeffersonian ideal.
[02:56:36.759 --> 02:56:38.160]  It's true freedom.
[02:56:38.160 --> 02:56:39.481]  It's true capitalism.
[02:56:39.481 --> 02:56:51.871]  What we have now, capitalism with social justice, is a hijack of liberal and conservative movements, creating kind of a synthetic system that just lets things get more and more consolidated.
[02:56:51.871 --> 02:56:55.674]  And they see our individuality, our freedom, those of us that don't fit in a box,
[02:56:56.414 --> 02:56:58.035]  Thank you so much.
[02:57:18.308 --> 02:57:19.048]  Thank you, my friend.
[02:57:19.048 --> 02:57:19.668]  I'll see you soon.
[02:57:19.668 --> 02:57:20.529]  I'll talk to you soon.
[02:57:20.529 --> 02:57:20.869]  Thank you.
[02:57:20.869 --> 02:57:21.909]  There he goes.
[02:57:21.909 --> 02:57:23.969]  Now, some stations don't carry the fourth hour.
[02:57:23.969 --> 02:57:25.070]  I used to do four hours.
[02:57:25.070 --> 02:57:26.510]  We do three hours the last few years.
[02:57:26.510 --> 02:57:27.150]  Some stations do.
[02:57:27.150 --> 02:57:28.990]  A lot of times I do overdrive.
[02:57:28.990 --> 02:57:30.251]  5, 10, 15, 20, 30 minutes.
[02:57:30.251 --> 02:57:31.591]  Sometimes a whole hour.
[02:57:31.591 --> 02:57:36.552]  You can always still see it at InfoWars.com forward slash show where the free feeds are.
[02:57:36.552 --> 02:57:40.173]  I'm going to come back and break down an article by Kit Daniels in a video.
[02:57:40.173 --> 02:57:41.393]  Hilarious video.
[02:57:41.393 --> 02:57:44.454]  Anti-gun group epically fails at mocking Second Amendment.
[02:57:45.074 --> 02:57:47.114]  This is put out by Funny or Die.
[02:57:47.114 --> 02:57:49.555]  We could really do a spoof on these people.
[02:57:49.555 --> 02:57:58.417]  And they make fun of ads that we've aired here on the network about gun crime, you know, dropping massively 80 plus percent in Kennesaw after it was made mandatory to own guns.
[02:57:58.417 --> 02:57:59.537]  They make a big joke out of it.
[02:57:59.537 --> 02:58:00.937]  That's coming up.
[02:58:00.937 --> 02:58:05.358]  Please remember the DNA forced sale ends next Wednesday.
[02:58:05.358 --> 02:58:09.179]  30% off the highest quality nutraceutical we could put out.
[02:58:09.639 --> 02:58:09.819]  For the
[02:58:32.202 --> 02:58:35.343]  Super Female is sold out, but Super Female works for females.
[02:58:35.343 --> 02:58:36.924]  Super Male works for females as well.
[02:58:36.924 --> 02:58:39.085]  Infowarslife.com.
[02:58:39.085 --> 02:58:41.606]  Thank you again for your support out there.
[02:58:41.606 --> 02:58:42.146]  Stay with us.
[02:58:42.146 --> 02:58:46.108]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[02:58:49.375 --> 02:58:58.382]  Sold out for weeks due to the difficult and extensive proprietary process behind its creation, the exclusive InfoWars Life Secret 12 formulation is now back in stock.
[02:58:58.382 --> 02:59:08.909]  This ultra-clean vitamin B12 nutraceutical has been carefully crafted and developed over the last two years and is based on cellular science of how your body actively absorbs essential nutrients.
[02:59:08.909 --> 02:59:14.974]  Most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic and could not be properly absorbed by the body.
[02:59:15.334 --> 02:59:21.739]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimedical-grade, bioavailable coenzyme forms of B12.
[02:59:21.739 --> 02:59:24.801]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections.
[02:59:24.801 --> 02:59:30.346]  And adenosylcobalamin, the most bioactive form that has been created with our proprietary process.
[02:59:30.346 --> 02:59:33.408]  Secret 12 is taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.
[02:59:33.408 --> 02:59:34.949]  No needles, no injections.
[02:59:34.949 --> 02:59:36.350]  Don't take my word for it.
[02:59:36.350 --> 02:59:37.551]  Try it for yourself.
[02:59:37.551 --> 02:59:38.872]  Discover the secret.
[02:59:38.872 --> 02:59:39.973]  Secret 12.
[02:59:39.973 --> 02:59:42.295]  Supplies of Secret 12 are very limited.

[02:59:51.898 --> 03:00:00.680]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:00.680 --> 03:00:06.101]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:06.101 --> 03:00:08.382]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[03:00:12.071 --> 03:00:14.173]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[03:00:14.173 --> 03:00:14.673]  to 2 p.m.
[03:00:14.673 --> 03:00:15.414]  Central, we're here.
[03:00:15.414 --> 03:00:17.675]  We're now in overdrive.
[03:00:17.675 --> 03:00:19.076]  I could spend an hour on this piece.
[03:00:19.076 --> 03:00:21.098]  The video's up on Infowars.com.
[03:00:21.098 --> 03:00:31.746]  And from Kit's perspective, writing for Infowars.com, it's funny how stupid they are, going, yeah, we want guns from areas where you can legally get them, because we're criminals.
[03:00:31.746 --> 03:00:33.247]  We want to go kill people in our states.
[03:00:34.153 --> 03:00:37.735]  It's the areas that have less gun laws that have lower crime on record.
[03:00:37.735 --> 03:00:40.216]  It's the areas that have the gun bans that have the highest crime rate.
[03:00:40.216 --> 03:00:46.458]  The criminals come into the areas where people are disarmed and that's where they engage in their predator activity.
[03:00:46.458 --> 03:00:49.620]  So from Kit's perspective, this is really stupid and looks ridiculous.
[03:00:49.620 --> 03:00:56.543]  Remember, they're targeting Jell-O heads that have grown up in front of television who don't even know how to tie their shoelaces and are scared of everything.
[03:00:58.356 --> 03:01:03.257]  The opposite of skin a buck, run a trot line, or go catch, you know, deep-sea fishing in 15-foot waves.
[03:01:03.257 --> 03:01:06.478]  I mean, these people are just jellyfish.
[03:01:06.478 --> 03:01:10.219]  They all have their own bodyguards, basically, out in Hollywood, and they don't want you to have them.
[03:01:10.219 --> 03:01:18.522]  So, yeah, you can laugh at the stupid video, but you have to understand, it's like laughing at Obama saying that 2 plus 2 equals 5.
[03:01:18.522 --> 03:01:19.882]  They got people that believe it.
[03:01:22.017 --> 03:01:23.038]  Okay.
[03:01:23.038 --> 03:01:27.781]  And remember, we're eating what Michelle Obama says in schools nationwide, so they're in control.
[03:01:27.781 --> 03:01:32.524]  And they get to tell us that the world's flat if they want to, because they're trendies.
[03:01:32.524 --> 03:01:37.768]  And this was funded by the Brady campaign, funding Funny or Die, which has done some funny videos.
[03:01:37.768 --> 03:01:39.629]  Here is the disinformation video.
[03:01:43.305 --> 03:01:47.967]  That's kind of like when they throw the Millennium Falcon in gear and it goes wah wah wah wah.
[03:01:47.967 --> 03:01:48.408]  There it is.
[03:01:48.408 --> 03:01:49.288]  Funny or Die.
[03:01:49.288 --> 03:01:53.971]  Before now, it's been difficult for criminals like us to know which states have loose gun laws.
[03:01:53.971 --> 03:02:00.594]  How would a criminal like me know which states permit me to carry loaded guns in their amusement parks, golf courses, or beaches?
[03:02:00.594 --> 03:02:01.835]  Hit pause.
[03:02:01.835 --> 03:02:05.837]  A criminal isn't going to care about the gun laws, dummy.
[03:02:05.837 --> 03:02:07.518]  That's why they're criminals.
[03:02:09.522 --> 03:02:11.203]  Let's go back to the mindlessness.
[03:02:11.203 --> 03:02:12.043]  No logic here.
[03:02:12.043 --> 03:02:13.864]  Just pure idiocy.
[03:02:13.864 --> 03:02:15.505]  But that's their audience.
[03:02:15.505 --> 03:02:21.008]  You've seen the Mark Dice interviews with people that can't tie their shoelaces and think Hitler's good or whatever.
[03:02:21.008 --> 03:02:22.528]  Or to say, lock up all the gun owners.
[03:02:22.528 --> 03:02:24.289]  This is who they're preying on.
[03:02:24.289 --> 03:02:27.070]  These people know they're preying on their audience.
[03:02:27.070 --> 03:02:27.951]  Let's go back to the clip.
[03:02:28.471 --> 03:02:29.632]  Violent friends.
[03:02:29.632 --> 03:02:32.333]  We all wear leather jackets and scream at women.
[03:02:32.333 --> 03:02:35.855]  And we want to find out which states we can buy and sell guns easily.
[03:02:35.855 --> 03:02:37.656]  So you hate women if you own guns.
[03:02:37.656 --> 03:02:40.718]  We all wear leather jackets and scream at women.
[03:02:40.718 --> 03:02:45.321]  See, it's not funny in the way they think, but it is funny if you're informed.
[03:02:45.321 --> 03:02:47.162]  Let's go back to the clip.
[03:02:47.162 --> 03:02:50.924]  Sergeant Rivera says what he witnessed.
[03:02:50.924 --> 03:02:57.408]  I guess I'm not meant to play this clip today because the computer is having a serious heart attack.
[03:02:59.172 --> 03:03:01.294]  Pardon me?
[03:03:01.294 --> 03:03:02.936]  Oh, we're training in this segment.
[03:03:02.936 --> 03:03:03.977]  That's good.
[03:03:03.977 --> 03:03:06.060]  I think we might not want to train during a live show.
[03:03:06.060 --> 03:03:09.684]  What do you think?
[03:03:09.684 --> 03:03:12.787]  Yeah, probably a good idea.
[03:03:12.787 --> 03:03:17.272]  I don't know what we're going to do here, but I want to play this right now, okay?
[03:03:17.272 --> 03:03:17.533]  Go ahead.
[03:03:18.783 --> 03:03:20.964]  ...leather jackets and scream at women.
[03:03:20.964 --> 03:03:24.705]  And we want to find out which states we can buy and sell guns easily.
[03:03:24.705 --> 03:03:26.585]  CrimAdvisor.com.
[03:03:26.585 --> 03:03:32.166]  That's the site to find out where it's easiest for felons and fugitives to buy, carry, and even traffic guns.
[03:03:32.166 --> 03:03:39.588]  That's why I love Arizona, where I can go see the beautiful Grand Canyon and carry a loaded gun without even having to get a background check.
[03:03:39.588 --> 03:03:41.589]  You would fail that background check.
[03:03:41.909 --> 03:03:42.870]  I'm sure of it.
[03:03:42.870 --> 03:03:44.371]  Now what about a road trip?
[03:03:44.371 --> 03:03:49.835]  What states can I go to to fill my trunk with guns and take it back home for my even more dangerous friends?
[03:03:49.835 --> 03:03:51.616]  Crim Advisor has a list for that.
[03:03:51.616 --> 03:03:53.117]  That's so unreasonable!
[03:03:53.117 --> 03:03:54.718]  Our trafficker's top ten.
[03:03:54.718 --> 03:03:55.599]  Nevada!
[03:03:55.599 --> 03:03:59.402]  What happens in Vegas may have to stay in Vegas, but your guns don't.
[03:03:59.402 --> 03:04:01.483]  Bring them over to California and sell them!
[03:04:01.483 --> 03:04:02.864]  The market up there is hungry.
[03:04:02.864 --> 03:04:04.025]  No, that's not true.
[03:04:04.025 --> 03:04:05.126]  You've restricted guns there.
[03:04:05.126 --> 03:04:09.509]  I understand that CrimAdvisor.com will tell me which states really cater to us criminals.
[03:04:09.929 --> 03:04:16.510]  Something they always do is they always aim guns at their faces and do stupid stuff with them as if legal gun owners do that.
[03:04:16.510 --> 03:04:18.350]  I mean, this is just unbelievable propaganda.
[03:04:18.350 --> 03:04:19.691]  Let's go back to the final bit.
[03:04:19.691 --> 03:04:22.451]  But what about the states where we're not so welcome?
[03:04:22.451 --> 03:04:24.131]  The ones that don't get us?
[03:04:24.131 --> 03:04:32.613]  I don't even like saying the name of these states, but California, Connecticut, Maryland, and New York all have laws to keep guns out of the hands of people like us.
[03:04:32.613 --> 03:04:34.153]  And they still have mass shootings in them.
[03:04:34.153 --> 03:04:35.713]  California's so bad!
[03:04:35.713 --> 03:04:36.433]  Boo!
[03:04:36.433 --> 03:04:37.094]  California!
[03:04:37.094 --> 03:04:39.114]  I'm gonna shoot a piece on this for the nightly news.
[03:04:39.114 --> 03:04:39.254]  Wow!
[03:04:39.634 --> 03:04:41.236]  In fact, fire up the Nightly News Studio.
[03:04:41.236 --> 03:04:43.399]  When this ends, I'm going in there and cutting this.
[03:04:43.399 --> 03:04:44.540]  Because this needs to be attacked.
[03:04:44.540 --> 03:04:46.042]  It needs to be exposed.
[03:04:46.042 --> 03:04:46.502]  All right.
[03:04:46.502 --> 03:04:49.646]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, with a retransmission.
[03:04:49.646 --> 03:04:51.208]  Great job of the crew.
[03:04:51.208 --> 03:04:53.110]  And Lord willing, we'll be back tomorrow.
[03:04:53.110 --> 03:04:54.752]  Not tomorrow.
[03:04:54.752 --> 03:04:57.516]  I'm completing this segment.
[03:04:57.516 --> 03:04:58.076]  Sunday, 4 to 6.
