[00:00:04.827 --> 00:00:05.808]  Jakari Jackson here.
[00:00:06.328 --> 00:00:09.471]  Jade Helm 15 has kicked off in the state of Texas.
[00:00:09.912 --> 00:00:19.201]  Now, in case you haven't heard enough about Jade Helm in the past few months, it's a military exercise over several different states involving various types of, I guess, training.
[00:00:19.501 --> 00:00:23.264]  In some places you're going to have guys trying to blend in with civilian populations.
[00:00:23.284 --> 00:00:24.846]  In some places you're going to have guys actually
[00:00:25.307 --> 00:00:28.988]  Jumping out of helicopters and other things to that effect.
[00:00:29.548 --> 00:00:43.112]  Now the reason we started covering this is early on we encountered some contradictory information because initially the guys were coming out and saying, the representatives of the drill, they were saying that we were invited onto people's land.
[00:00:43.152 --> 00:00:49.314]  People just, you know, happened to call the base one day and said, hey, why don't you come out here and use our private land for your military exercise?
[00:00:49.654 --> 00:00:54.216]  And then we found out through various outlets that that wasn't necessarily the case.
[00:00:55.911 --> 00:00:58.637]  So, how counties were picked in Texas comes down to this.
[00:00:58.657 --> 00:01:01.823]  The land was volunteered by the private landowner.
[00:01:01.884 --> 00:01:02.785]  They came to us.
[00:01:03.972 --> 00:01:07.615]  Okay, they are not getting any reimbursement for volunteering their land.
[00:01:08.375 --> 00:01:13.359]  They believe in training America's special operations forces, not only in work, but also in deed.
[00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.061]  News West 9 out of Big Spring, Texas.
[00:01:16.441 --> 00:01:20.084]  And this is one of the areas where there will be Jade Helm exercises conducted.
[00:01:20.864 --> 00:01:27.849]  And the title of the article, written by Julia Ding, says Big Spring landowners paid to accommodate Jade Helm.
[00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:32.032]  This is a quote from the mayor, Larry McLeelan.
[00:01:32.933 --> 00:01:38.075]  Now didn't the Lieutenant Colonel just say that there was going to be no payoffs whatsoever?
[00:01:39.135 --> 00:01:44.277]  And in this article it says that the landowners were approached by the government.
[00:01:45.818 --> 00:01:50.360]  So there's Lieutenant Colonel LaStoria and also Thomas Meade, the two representatives for the drill.
[00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:54.181]  Now at the gathering,
[00:01:54.568 --> 00:01:57.231]  Lieutenant Colonel spoke, but Thomas Meade did not.
[00:01:57.692 --> 00:02:10.847]  And the reason I bring this up is because you have two representatives who are reading off cue cards and PowerPoint presentations, and at least in Bastrop, Texas, they were standing about five yards away from each other, and they couldn't keep the story straight amongst themselves.
[00:02:12.435 --> 00:02:17.197]  So, we're not training any type of law enforcement during this training exercise.
[00:02:17.377 --> 00:02:18.017]  It's not happening.
[00:02:18.057 --> 00:02:25.540]  The only coordination now that will take place is we're just letting them know, hey, here's what happened the last 24 hours, here's what's happening the next 24 hours.
[00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:34.823]  Because there are times where we ask, at times, the law enforcement folks to do a traffic stop for us.
[00:02:35.307 --> 00:02:41.230]  To check our guys to see why they're doing what they're doing, when they're doing it, and why they're doing it.
[00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:46.633]  Talking about role players, and you mentioned the role players, I'm curious as to how you guys came about these role players.
[00:02:46.653 --> 00:02:50.996]  As far as the role players go, they are going to be service members.
[00:02:51.296 --> 00:02:54.558]  We can't do the exercise without the public's help.
[00:02:55.919 --> 00:03:02.002]  Things that we look for from that perspective is we look for people that are willing to be a role player.
[00:03:03.018 --> 00:03:07.521]  Now back when you were a child and they gave you that test and they said, Hey, which were these statements don't go together.
[00:03:07.901 --> 00:03:17.167]  Had you pointed out back in the day that what the story is saying today doesn't match up with what me said a few weeks ago, you would've got the gold star for critical thinking and common sense.
[00:03:17.547 --> 00:03:20.569]  But if you do that as an adult, they call you a conspiracy theorist.
[00:03:20.929 --> 00:03:24.011]  Right now, I want to direct your attention to a New York Times article.
[00:03:24.691 --> 00:03:27.113]  As Jade Helm 15 military exercise begins,
[00:03:27.873 --> 00:03:29.975]  Texans keep watch just in case.
[00:03:30.195 --> 00:03:49.074]  Now the reason I bring this up is because they'll start with a statement here that's actually the first sentence and then they liken InfoWars to it later on in the article, which is to say that because InfoWars questions various aspects of Jade Helm and points out when their spokesman can't keep their story straight, we automatically have to fall into some of the
[00:03:49.915 --> 00:03:52.557]  Wild conspiracy theories that are actually conspiracy theories.
[00:03:53.197 --> 00:03:54.438]  First sentence in this article.
[00:03:55.278 --> 00:04:01.721]  Despite the internet chatter about trains with shackles and Walmart stores being closed to be used as detention camps.
[00:04:01.941 --> 00:04:02.862]  Let's stop right there.
[00:04:04.323 --> 00:04:15.469]  Our head writer, head editor of InfoWars.com, Paul Joseph Watson, put out not one but two videos debunking these Walmart claims that they're supposed to be used for Jade Helm 15.
[00:04:15.749 --> 00:04:17.650]  Here's a very short section of that.
[00:04:19.659 --> 00:04:24.641]  And yes, the plumbing explanation does appear to be a complete lie.
[00:04:25.121 --> 00:04:27.502]  At least in the case of Pico Rivera, California.
[00:04:28.042 --> 00:04:33.604]  But it's not a cover-up for Wal-Mart stores being used in the Jade Helm military exercise.
[00:04:33.944 --> 00:04:40.166]  It's not a cover for the implementation of martial law or FEMA death camps.
[00:04:41.735 --> 00:04:42.395]  So there you have it.
[00:04:42.635 --> 00:04:46.557]  InfoWars' position is that Walmarts have nothing to do with Jade Helm 15.
[00:04:46.837 --> 00:04:52.819]  Now let's scroll down further in the article to where they actually mention InfoWars and Alex Jones by name.
[00:04:53.820 --> 00:05:02.963]  A report on InfoWars, a website operated by Alex Jones, a libertarian-leaning radio talk show host from Texas, at least they called him a libertarian and not a Republican as many
[00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:10.539]  These sites try to do suggest that the name HELM was an acronym for Homeland Eradication of Local Militants.
[00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:16.307]  When I heard this news and read this article, I went and asked our writers, do you guys know anything about this acronym?
[00:05:16.988 --> 00:05:20.392]  Kit said no, we didn't write it, but I do believe I know where it came from.
[00:05:21.053 --> 00:05:23.714]  And he directed me to this Planet Info Wars.
[00:05:23.774 --> 00:05:29.597]  It's a site for our viewers, fans, people to go in there and share different types of information and conduct their own research.
[00:05:29.957 --> 00:05:33.659]  Now, while we do encourage people's research, we don't necessarily agree with all of it.
[00:05:34.179 --> 00:05:35.620]  And here's a comment from Luke.
[00:05:37.021 --> 00:05:47.586]  Jade Helm deciphered, and this is talking about the acronym, Joint Assistance for Development and Execution, along with Homeland Eradication of Local Militants.
[00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:51.152]  And he goes on to add, it doesn't get any clearer than this.
[00:05:51.532 --> 00:05:56.615]  And once again, we do encourage Luke and anybody else to do their own research, but we don't necessarily agree with it.
[00:05:56.875 --> 00:05:57.556]  Flip this around.
[00:05:57.596 --> 00:06:13.666]  Let's say if you went to NFL.com, I'm pretty sure the New York Times, the toilet paper of record as Gerald Salente likes to call them, wouldn't go to NFL.com, go to the comments section and find somebody who took the NFL acronym, National Football League, and changed it into something else.
[00:06:13.906 --> 00:06:14.627]  We're good to go.
[00:06:38.464 --> 00:06:40.025]  My name is Alex Jones.
[00:06:40.445 --> 00:06:46.510]  Most of you know me from my syndicated radio program and my documentary films, as well as InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:06:46.730 --> 00:07:01.240]  When I got on air 20 years ago, I had discovered the Globalist program, their plan to take over the world, and my focus went from running 6 miles every other day, swimming 2-3 miles a couple times a week, and lifting weights
[00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:01.980]  I think?
[00:07:23.626 --> 00:07:23.846]  I think so.
