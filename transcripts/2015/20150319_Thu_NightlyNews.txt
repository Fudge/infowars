[00:00:19.465 --> 00:00:21.608]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:21.648 --> 00:00:25.835]  It is Thursday, March 19th, 2015, and I'm Leigh Ann McAdoo.
[00:00:26.115 --> 00:00:27.518]  Here are tonight's top stories.
[00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:46.641]  Texas is listed in red as a hostile sector.
[00:00:47.042 --> 00:00:48.803]  I told you I'm deep behind enemy lines, folks.
[00:00:48.883 --> 00:00:52.586]  I mean, we are listed as a hostile sector.
[00:00:52.847 --> 00:00:58.732]  They're having Delta Force, Navy SEALs with the Army trained to basically take over.
[00:01:00.973 --> 00:01:07.238]  According to a newly released military document, it looks like the feds are getting ready to invade Texas.
[00:01:07.618 --> 00:01:10.160]  This is according to the Jade Helm 1-5.
[00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.423]  It's a joint military training exercise document.
[00:01:13.803 --> 00:01:17.006]  It's going to take place across seven states for eight weeks.
[00:01:17.686 --> 00:01:23.152]  And according to this document, it says residents may see an increase in aircraft in the area overnight.
[00:01:23.633 --> 00:01:29.239]  There might be an increase in suspicious activities, calls and noise disturbances.
[00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:32.703]  And joining me in the studio is Joe Biggs.
[00:01:32.763 --> 00:01:36.247]  Now Joe, you actually brought this to the attention of Alex Jones during the radio show today.
[00:01:36.627 --> 00:01:38.830]  It made it to the Drudge Report within about...
[00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.053]  Yes, I mean within the hour.
[00:01:41.694 --> 00:01:48.803]  Now, obviously a training exercise like this can be really beneficial for our soldiers, so why is this one of such a concern?
[00:01:49.445 --> 00:01:57.808]  Well the thing is, is we keep seeing these small urban warfare training centers, these asymmetric warfare training centers popping up all across the country.
[00:01:58.328 --> 00:02:02.090]  Fort AP Hill that David Knight and I went to for about a week or so.
[00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.571]  Then there's another one in North Carolina that the U.S.
[00:02:04.611 --> 00:02:05.931]  Marine Corps is using as well.
[00:02:06.352 --> 00:02:08.953]  These are towns that look like urban America.
[00:02:09.293 --> 00:02:11.954]  Soccer fields, you know, churches, mosques.
[00:02:12.734 --> 00:02:41.934]  Subway systems all this stuff and in the military you haven't we have a saying you train how you fight you train in An area that will be like the theater of operation that you're gonna be conducting combat operations in So that's what makes me scared based off of that type of logic using the military you train how you fight you train in the atmosphere of an area you're gonna be training and why is This theater of operation this training look like America and now they're taking this training from these small, you know
[00:02:43.675 --> 00:02:44.556]  We're good to go.
[00:03:02.678 --> 00:03:17.905]  Right, and they're saying, you know, letting, working in conjunction now with local law enforcement agencies, obviously going against the Posse Comitatus Act right there with that, but just letting them know, hey, you know, you might have some more people calling in about some suspicious activities, which, what does that mean?
[00:03:17.945 --> 00:03:31.811]  Do I need to be concerned that there's going to be someone in fatigues with a sniper rifle outside my window just training for... Well, one of the things that really caught my eye when I was looking over the document, it says, be aware of increased aircraft activity at night.
[00:03:32.111 --> 00:03:36.196]  And that's something I'm going to touch on more in depth later in a special report that's going to be coming up.
[00:03:36.856 --> 00:03:49.110]  But what you have to understand is, is me being a former vet myself, I've been in Iraq and Afghanistan, I've worked with special operations, Green Berets, you know, Rangers, all the different SOCOM people that they have.
[00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:52.033]  And at nighttime, they go out in helicopters and they do raids.
[00:03:52.794 --> 00:03:56.255]  That's why it's concerning for me because this is a snatch and grab mentality.
[00:03:56.495 --> 00:03:57.576]  This is what I think is going to happen.
[00:03:57.596 --> 00:04:04.038]  These guys are going to be doing operations in these towns via helicopters at night time, propelling down, going to people's homes.
[00:04:04.339 --> 00:04:06.459]  You know, you throw a bag over their head and you take them off.
[00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:12.402]  This is going to get the military prepared and trained and ready to start throwing citizens in FEMA camps.
[00:04:12.442 --> 00:04:13.942]  And this is something we have to be concerned about.
[00:04:14.162 --> 00:04:15.423]  And it's something that we're going to cover.
[00:04:15.443 --> 00:04:17.764]  We're going to look at very closely to make sure
[00:04:18.484 --> 00:04:18.724]  That's
[00:04:36.616 --> 00:04:43.465]  Yeah, it's Navy SEALs, Army Green Berets, Delta Force, you've got Air Force Commandos, you've got the U.S.
[00:04:43.545 --> 00:04:46.469]  Marine Corps Special Operations Group, U.S.
[00:04:46.509 --> 00:04:53.799]  Marine Expeditionary Fighting Forces, and also you have the 82nd Airborne, which is a unit that I used to be a part of as well, that's going to be conducting these exercises.
[00:04:54.099 --> 00:04:56.000]  Yeah, it's around 1,200 troops.
[00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:02.885]  But the main thing we showed earlier was the map, how they have Texas labeled as red, how they have Utah labeled as red.
[00:05:03.265 --> 00:05:06.667]  Now if you go look at the legend in that map, it shows you that these are hostile areas.
[00:05:06.987 --> 00:05:12.090]  Now why would they label Texas and Utah hostile in this training exercise?
[00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:20.095]  I think one of the main reasons is there's a lot of military forces, a lot of military troops, I should say, that come out of Utah and Texas and Ohio and all these other states.
[00:05:22.145 --> 00:05:26.307]  And we've heard time and time again that the government comes out and says that returning vets are the number one threat.
[00:05:26.747 --> 00:05:43.836]  And this is why I think this is very concerning that they have Texas labels that we have a lot of pro-gun, a lot of pro-constitutionals, a lot of patriots who live in these areas and I think that's why they've chosen this because they're afraid that Texas could break away in a civil war against the United States and there'd be an uprising.
[00:05:44.196 --> 00:05:47.098]  And what they're doing is they're calling this unconventional warfare training.
[00:05:47.498 --> 00:05:58.086]  Unconventional warfare training is, by definition right here, warfare activities consist of activities conducted to go after a resistance movement or insurgency.
[00:05:58.387 --> 00:06:06.073]  But you have to focus on the resistance movement part because the patriot movement that's been going on, this liberty movement, has kind of kicked into full gear lately.
[00:06:06.413 --> 00:06:07.834]  And I think the government sees that.
[00:06:08.034 --> 00:06:13.879]  They know a lot of people are waking up fast and they're trying to do the training they can to get ready for an uprise if it does happen.
[00:06:14.139 --> 00:06:24.301]  Absolutely, and that it falls in line with a lot of other training manuals that we've seen reported on the civil disturbance operations that was a leaked military police training manual.
[00:06:24.321 --> 00:06:24.981]  It came out in 2012.
[00:06:25.822 --> 00:06:35.984]  They were in that soldiers would be ordered to confiscate firearms, kill American dissidents, prisoners would be detained in temporary internment camps and re-educated
[00:06:36.384 --> 00:06:36.664]  Thank you.
[00:06:55.694 --> 00:07:09.181]  Well, yeah, well one of the cool things at the end of this video, we're going to air never-before-seen footage of Obama Deception 2 talking about these, you know, government-run PSYOPs in other countries that are now going to be operating domestically here in America.
[00:07:09.461 --> 00:07:12.883]  So this is something that it's going to be very eye-opening for a lot of people.
[00:07:13.243 --> 00:07:16.265]  But this stuff's been happening in little sections throughout the past few years.
[00:07:16.385 --> 00:07:16.605]  Right.
[00:07:16.785 --> 00:07:20.667]  You know, we saw the uprising in Ferguson, we saw how they brought out that
[00:07:21.087 --> 00:07:21.467]  I think so.
[00:07:45.595 --> 00:07:50.819]  So this stuff is happening piece by piece, but this right here, this operation, this Jade Helm 1-5...
[00:07:53.182 --> 00:07:57.766]  It gives me goosebumps, and it's something that I think people need to be very upset about.
[00:07:57.786 --> 00:07:59.047]  They need to research it themselves.
[00:07:59.067 --> 00:08:00.349]  Don't just listen to what we're saying.
[00:08:00.769 --> 00:08:01.290]  Go out here.
[00:08:01.370 --> 00:08:02.070]  Go to the website.
[00:08:02.090 --> 00:08:03.071]  You can find it yourself.
[00:08:03.432 --> 00:08:03.992]  Read about it.
[00:08:04.172 --> 00:08:04.973]  Educate yourself.
[00:08:05.233 --> 00:08:07.956]  And stay tuned for more reports on this, because we're going to be covering this.
[00:08:08.316 --> 00:08:12.240]  Because when the time comes, when this operation starts, I'm going to camp out out there.
[00:08:12.521 --> 00:08:16.985]  I'm going to be out there in the woods every day, filming, recording, and finding out what is going on.
[00:08:17.185 --> 00:08:28.675]  Right, and I just think it's insane that they would think that our patriots would turn against their own American people and they're going to train them and I mean it might just be a huge sigh off on the military.
[00:08:28.715 --> 00:08:36.201]  But one of the funny things that they said in the documents, they said that this operation will be conducted in Texas because Texans support military operations.
[00:08:36.481 --> 00:08:41.866]  Yeah, we support military operations in a combat scenario against a bad guy.
[00:08:42.086 --> 00:08:42.266]  Right.
[00:08:42.306 --> 00:08:44.968]  Why is our military training to conduct operations
[00:08:45.749 --> 00:08:46.029]  I think so.
[00:09:04.782 --> 00:09:13.108]  Getting that one-on-one experience, seeing soldiers with an assault rifle around them, the helicopters flying overhead, the tanks coming in, the MRAPs, so they can desensitize people to that.
[00:09:13.148 --> 00:09:16.950]  So when it does happen, they think it'll make a smoother transition.
[00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:21.073]  But I guarantee you right now, people in Texas aren't going to stand for something like this.
[00:09:21.253 --> 00:09:22.193]  Absolutely not.
[00:09:22.374 --> 00:09:25.856]  And I think we really are being geared up for some sort of civil unrest.
[00:09:26.296 --> 00:09:30.179]  And it's just like William Binney, NSA whistleblower William Binney said yesterday,
[00:09:30.919 --> 00:09:36.321]  You know, that we are now working with a government who has a country and not the other way around.
[00:09:36.341 --> 00:09:38.242]  I mean, they're trying to force vaccinations on people.
[00:09:38.262 --> 00:09:39.202]  They're trying to take our guns.
[00:09:39.222 --> 00:09:40.542]  They're trying to ban the ammo.
[00:09:40.903 --> 00:09:47.285]  So essentially, if they can't ban the guns, if they ban the ammo, then your weapon is, you know, essentially not, you know, it's just a paperweight.
[00:09:47.425 --> 00:09:47.645]  Right.
[00:09:47.725 --> 00:09:52.907]  So they're trying everything they can on all fronts to attack us, to attack our rights, to take our liberties.
[00:09:53.147 --> 00:09:55.148]  And this is something that people got to be pissed off about.
[00:09:55.368 --> 00:09:56.288]  And we've got to do something.
[00:09:56.468 --> 00:09:56.988]  Absolutely.
[00:09:57.008 --> 00:09:58.569]  Well, we're looking forward to your report.
[00:09:58.669 --> 00:09:58.969]  Thank you.
[00:10:00.222 --> 00:10:07.305]  All right, well, coming up, stick around because we are going to talk about race, and specifically, how not to talk about race.

[00:12:14.892 --> 00:12:17.815]  Well this week it is South by Southwest here in Austin.
[00:12:17.955 --> 00:12:24.040]  Austin is on a world stage, so it's a great place for people with an agenda to get their message out there.
[00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:28.524]  And that's why I think this story that's coming out of Austin this week is a little bit suspect.
[00:12:30.305 --> 00:12:36.350]  What we're dealing with, someone is posting racist stickers on businesses in East Austin.
[00:12:36.990 --> 00:12:42.655]  These stickers say that the businesses are exclusively for white people.
[00:12:42.955 --> 00:12:46.638]  They go on to say a bunch of other, you know, really abhorrent things.
[00:12:46.998 --> 00:12:54.965]  But these are on six East Austin businesses, and in addition to these disparaging words, the stickers are using the city's logo.
[00:12:55.325 --> 00:13:04.351]  So this gives the impression that they represent the city of Austin and that the city of Austin has some program in place to segregate businesses.
[00:13:04.851 --> 00:13:13.117]  Now, obviously the mayor is not amused, these business owners are not amused, and Texas State Rep Donna Dukes as well has chimed in.
[00:13:13.537 --> 00:13:19.541]  Now, initially on her own Facebook page earlier today, she said, some jokes just are not funny.
[00:13:20.041 --> 00:13:28.209]  If this is even a joke at all, it's tasteless and she suggested that if the shops themselves were involved, they need to be put out of business.
[00:13:28.529 --> 00:13:37.797]  So actually calling on people to boycott these businesses, meanwhile the business owners had no idea that these stickers were placed on the outside of their business.
[00:13:38.118 --> 00:13:42.101]  The stickers were incredibly professional looking, they weren't just someone
[00:13:42.802 --> 00:13:44.523]  Putting up graffiti or something like that.
[00:13:44.563 --> 00:13:46.205]  They were really well done.
[00:13:46.225 --> 00:13:49.907]  So I wouldn't be surprised if George Soros paid for these stickers.
[00:13:50.408 --> 00:13:58.013]  Now Donna Dukes also went on to say that she's really concerned that these stickers could have been placed there to cause racial tension.
[00:13:58.413 --> 00:13:59.034]  Ya think?
[00:13:59.674 --> 00:14:04.978]  This area where these stickers were placed is a rapidly gentrifying part of Austin.
[00:14:05.018 --> 00:14:10.262]  So we're already kind of dealing with a lot of racial tension in some of these areas that are being gentrified.
[00:14:12.123 --> 00:14:21.408]  This is clearly not a business owner putting this on their business and frankly I don't think it's a racist white person who would put these stickers on these businesses.
[00:14:21.748 --> 00:14:28.732]  This is probably more so created by someone who is upset with all the gentrification happening in that neighborhood.
[00:14:29.292 --> 00:14:35.095]  Do you think this is the best way to draw attention to a rapidly gentrifying neighborhood?
[00:14:35.755 --> 00:14:36.115]  I don't know.
[00:14:56.266 --> 00:15:00.107]  I don't want a, you know, white privilege latte at Starbucks.
[00:15:00.147 --> 00:15:02.547]  I don't need a lecture when I'm going to get my coffee.
[00:15:03.048 --> 00:15:06.528]  And this whole sticker thing is, it's very negative.
[00:15:06.568 --> 00:15:09.949]  It's basically kind of saying, you're racist.
[00:15:10.189 --> 00:15:11.490]  And I say that you're racist.
[00:15:11.650 --> 00:15:14.430]  And now you need to prove that you're not.
[00:15:15.030 --> 00:15:17.351]  Similar to the Black Lives Matter protesters.
[00:15:17.851 --> 00:15:21.112]  Once again, they are targeting white people at brunch.
[00:15:22.170 --> 00:15:23.891]  Again, I just don't understand this.
[00:15:23.931 --> 00:15:34.078]  Now, this particular group compelled these people who were just sitting there eating brunch to awkwardly raise their hands and show their support for Michael Brown.
[00:15:34.618 --> 00:15:36.839]  Why is he the poster child of this movement?
[00:15:37.340 --> 00:15:39.581]  Hands up, don't shoot was a lie.
[00:15:40.181 --> 00:15:42.743]  Why are you targeting white people at brunch?
[00:15:42.923 --> 00:15:43.964]  I do not understand.
[00:15:44.004 --> 00:15:44.584]  That's the thing.
[00:15:44.624 --> 00:15:46.645]  It's like, anyone says anything,
[00:15:47.646 --> 00:15:48.106]  I don't know.
[00:16:03.393 --> 00:16:04.834]  You know, if you're white, then you are.
[00:16:04.894 --> 00:16:07.715]  It's kind of like, if you have a penis, then you're sexist.
[00:16:07.735 --> 00:16:08.975]  It's just, it is what it is.
[00:16:09.475 --> 00:16:19.579]  Now last week, Obama joked about being Kenyan, but earlier, Charlie Sheen tweeted basically the same thing, and he was attacked.
[00:16:19.659 --> 00:16:20.840]  He was called a racist.
[00:16:21.420 --> 00:16:30.046]  So, Sheen criticized Obama for spending more time on the NCAA bracket picks instead of attending funerals of dead U.S.
[00:16:30.106 --> 00:16:30.587]  soldiers.
[00:16:30.867 --> 00:16:32.608]  A lot of people were really upset about that.
[00:16:32.688 --> 00:16:36.231]  And, I mean, the President has done that quite a few times.
[00:16:36.251 --> 00:16:41.174]  You know, he talks about someone being beheaded and then he goes off and plays a round of golf.
[00:16:41.654 --> 00:16:46.038]  So, in this particular tweet, Charlie Sheen called him Barry Satoro Kenya.
[00:16:46.798 --> 00:16:48.739]  Now, that's not racist.
[00:16:49.579 --> 00:16:57.303]  That is, oh, I mean, what's the most offensive about that tweet is Charlie Sheen's spelling, his abuse of the English language.
[00:16:57.383 --> 00:16:59.504]  That is what was so offensive to me.
[00:17:00.104 --> 00:17:03.806]  But the fact that he called him Barry Satoro Kenya, those are facts.
[00:17:05.356 --> 00:17:13.704]  President Barack Obama used to be known as Barry Satoro when he was growing up in Indonesia, and we all know that he has a Kenyan background.
[00:17:13.885 --> 00:17:17.288]  You don't have to buy into the whole birther thing or any of that.
[00:17:17.789 --> 00:17:19.210]  Those are facts.
[00:17:19.310 --> 00:17:20.651]  But if you want to state facts,
[00:17:21.272 --> 00:17:22.072]  You're a racist.
[00:17:22.292 --> 00:17:27.253]  So obviously labeling everything racist or sexist isn't going to win anything at the end of the day.
[00:17:27.273 --> 00:17:34.555]  You're going to, in fact, turn a lot of people off from your movement, which is exactly what we saw happening in Ferguson.
[00:17:34.695 --> 00:17:38.716]  The entire country was there in support of these protesters.
[00:17:38.756 --> 00:17:45.217]  The entire country was appalled at the militarized police and the way they were treating these protesters.
[00:17:45.537 --> 00:17:50.478]  And then immediately you saw the race baiters swoop in and they changed the whole
[00:17:50.538 --> 00:17:50.938]  I think so.
[00:18:07.492 --> 00:18:11.234]  And they are fomenting anger and divisiveness.
[00:18:11.655 --> 00:18:17.578]  Now, coming up at the end of the show, I'm going to air the full interview that I did with the Huey Newton Gun Club.
[00:18:17.598 --> 00:18:19.839]  It took place during South by Southwest this week.
[00:18:20.300 --> 00:18:21.520]  You saw the other video.
[00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:24.342]  It's gotten nearly 100,000 hits at this point.
[00:18:24.762 --> 00:18:29.065]  It was basically just this group chanting about killing cops.
[00:18:29.665 --> 00:18:32.726]  Obviously very sensational, very sensational chanting.
[00:18:32.846 --> 00:18:34.347]  People were just outraged.
[00:18:34.887 --> 00:18:41.430]  I mean, here they are allowed to peaceably protest because of their First Amendment rights and they're chanting about killing cops.
[00:18:42.110 --> 00:18:50.354]  Now, when I first was interviewing the spokesperson for this Huey E. Newton Gun Club, you know, I was agreeing with a lot of the things that he was saying.
[00:18:50.754 --> 00:18:57.877]  Talking about the Second Amendment, how black people have the right to defend themselves, they have the right to bear arms, and that's absolutely true.
[00:18:58.397 --> 00:19:05.039]  But then they go and give this very divisive message, this divisive chant about killing cops.
[00:19:05.499 --> 00:19:15.143]  So I want you to watch that because it's just another example of where your words and your actions are not matching up, and you are dividing the country rather than
[00:19:15.583 --> 00:19:17.064]  Joining the Liberty Movement.
[00:19:17.124 --> 00:19:18.025]  We're for you.
[00:19:18.065 --> 00:19:20.827]  We want you to exercise your Second Amendment.
[00:19:20.847 --> 00:19:22.508]  You do have the right to protect yourself.
[00:19:22.548 --> 00:19:28.152]  You do have a right to, you know, to be a part of what this is we're trying to do here.
[00:19:28.212 --> 00:19:29.553]  You know, you are America.
[00:19:29.873 --> 00:19:33.135]  But that's what this is all about, is dividing us.
[00:19:33.255 --> 00:19:38.499]  Because we know if we all join hands and we rise together, we're going to be unstoppable.
[00:19:38.679 --> 00:19:40.921]  And when they saw that starting to happen with Ferguson,
[00:19:41.854 --> 00:19:43.316]  They were like, we can't let that happen.
[00:19:43.576 --> 00:19:45.859]  We need to divide these people once again.
[00:19:47.082 --> 00:19:53.187]  Now, not to mention the fact that millions of white people voted for the first black president.
[00:19:53.827 --> 00:19:59.292]  Okay, so the country seemed to be a little bit better in racial lines before the president came into office.
[00:19:59.932 --> 00:20:02.274]  Now, things have really gone off the rails.
[00:20:02.755 --> 00:20:07.699]  One thing Obama is saying that can dramatically improve the country is mandatory voting.
[00:20:08.339 --> 00:20:11.321]  Now, he says that it would be transformative if everybody voted.
[00:20:12.202 --> 00:20:12.442]  I don't
[00:20:32.034 --> 00:20:34.455]  Obviously is not democratic at all.
[00:20:34.615 --> 00:20:35.856]  It is authoritarian.
[00:20:36.556 --> 00:20:44.439]  Now, in this article, they point out how mandatory voting would work out, of course, for all of those newly licensed people in the country.
[00:20:44.940 --> 00:20:51.803]  And of course, those who really don't have any idea about politics, but they can be swayed to vote for people simply because of the color of their skin.
[00:20:52.603 --> 00:21:03.377]  Now, I spoke with some folks out at South by Southwest, talked to them about, you know, this voting, as well as, you know, what do they think about the president running for a third term.
[00:21:03.437 --> 00:21:05.279]  You might be surprised about what some of them said.
[00:21:09.835 --> 00:21:16.800]  Hillary has kind of been doing such a bad job, the Democrats don't really have anybody, and Obama is toying with the idea of running for a third term.
[00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:20.722]  We want to put out a video that tells him to do it.
[00:21:20.742 --> 00:21:24.465]  I already voted for you last year, so I'll vote for you again next time too.
[00:21:24.645 --> 00:21:26.326]  Or not last year, but last term.
[00:21:26.726 --> 00:21:29.988]  Obama, you should run for a third term because we need you.
[00:21:30.008 --> 00:21:30.829]  Obama's third term?
[00:21:30.849 --> 00:21:32.330]  No.
[00:21:33.410 --> 00:21:35.712]  Are you guys lined up to vote for Obama's third term?
[00:21:37.884 --> 00:21:39.045]  That way everyone's here in line?
[00:21:39.586 --> 00:21:41.288]  We need Obama to run for the third term.
[00:21:41.668 --> 00:21:45.072]  So I want the whole country to vote for Obama.
[00:21:45.092 --> 00:21:47.375]  Are you here voting for Obama's third term?
[00:21:47.515 --> 00:21:48.316]  Yes, of course.
[00:21:48.396 --> 00:21:50.699]  I honestly think, why not?
[00:21:50.999 --> 00:21:54.363]  Obama's the first black president, why might I be the first person in history to go three terms?
[00:21:55.604 --> 00:21:56.345]  F*** about Obama.
[00:21:56.865 --> 00:22:00.547]  I think Obama is going to give it a shot, but it's still pretty important.
[00:22:00.827 --> 00:22:02.808]  I'm going to go with he's not going to get this one done.
[00:22:02.828 --> 00:22:04.389]  Obama to run for a third term?
[00:22:04.429 --> 00:22:04.650]  Boo!
[00:22:04.670 --> 00:22:05.230]  F*** it!
[00:22:05.570 --> 00:22:05.730]  Boo!
[00:22:05.870 --> 00:22:06.170]  F*** it!
[00:22:06.190 --> 00:22:08.172]  You forget what state you're in.
[00:22:08.532 --> 00:22:13.155]  I don't hate it, it sounds alright to me, but I'm an American, so that's all that matters.
[00:22:14.076 --> 00:22:21.261]  Well, if you love America, then you know the Constitution has a 22nd Amendment, and he can't run for a third term, even though he wants to!
[00:22:21.481 --> 00:22:23.282]  I know he can, but I didn't know he wanted to run.
[00:22:23.543 --> 00:22:27.625]  I'd say he did a good job, but I just don't think we need to have a president in office.
[00:22:28.206 --> 00:22:30.988]  You know, if we were to limit to, like, four terms,
[00:22:32.130 --> 00:22:33.090]  That wouldn't be too bad.
[00:22:33.170 --> 00:22:34.330]  Third term.
[00:22:34.611 --> 00:22:35.231]  Make it happen.
[00:22:35.451 --> 00:22:35.691]  Boom.
[00:22:35.871 --> 00:22:36.091]  Boom.
[00:22:36.351 --> 00:22:38.091]  Obama, run for a third term.
[00:22:38.131 --> 00:22:41.752]  We really don't want him to, so... Do I think he can make it happen?
[00:22:41.792 --> 00:22:42.132]  Yes.
[00:22:42.292 --> 00:22:43.933]  Do we care about the amendments?
[00:22:44.033 --> 00:22:45.453]  Or the Constitution?
[00:22:46.253 --> 00:22:47.213]  Yeah, I get it.
[00:22:47.293 --> 00:22:50.254]  I don't think it's an option, so I think we're okay.
[00:22:50.514 --> 00:22:52.114]  Obama, third term!
[00:22:52.154 --> 00:22:53.775]  It's for the kids!
[00:22:53.795 --> 00:22:54.395]  It's for us!
[00:22:55.259 --> 00:22:57.320]  No, I do not want that man for a third term.
[00:22:57.380 --> 00:22:59.922]  Our government can go ahead and burn itself down before I do.
[00:22:59.962 --> 00:23:00.963]  So are you going to vote for Hillary?
[00:23:01.023 --> 00:23:02.323]  I ain't voting for any of them.
[00:23:02.363 --> 00:23:03.384]  That woman doesn't need to run either.
[00:23:03.404 --> 00:23:04.605]  So are you going to vote for Bush?
[00:23:04.765 --> 00:23:05.906]  I ain't voting for none of them.
[00:23:06.406 --> 00:23:07.166]  You can't do that.
[00:23:07.747 --> 00:23:08.267]  Why?
[00:23:08.968 --> 00:23:10.108]  You can only do two terms.
[00:23:11.069 --> 00:23:13.570]  We just gotta do away with that pesky 22nd Amendment?
[00:23:13.590 --> 00:23:14.191]  Don't think so.
[00:23:15.351 --> 00:23:15.652]  Yeah?
[00:23:16.212 --> 00:23:16.832]  Four more years?
[00:23:16.852 --> 00:23:17.433]  You can't do that.
[00:23:18.266 --> 00:23:19.627]  Sorry, I'm pro-America.
[00:23:20.227 --> 00:23:24.489]  There's a reason that Hillary Clinton is not up for this in charge of the United States.
[00:23:24.769 --> 00:23:33.634]  He has signed a lot of executive orders, and this is something that he thinks that it could be fun to kind of mess around with the amendments, and people want him to run for a third term.
[00:23:34.094 --> 00:23:35.274]  The Democrats have no one.
[00:23:35.955 --> 00:23:39.416]  That may be the case, but, you know, the Constitution's got to work.
[00:23:39.696 --> 00:23:46.060]  If you don't vote for Obama for a third term, you're voting for Bush or Hillary, so... Well, like a different Bush?
[00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:46.360]  Yeah!
[00:23:47.462 --> 00:23:47.783]  Oh!
[00:23:48.204 --> 00:23:48.886]  Baby brother blue.
[00:23:48.906 --> 00:23:50.611]  Sounds like a Triple Lose situation to me.
[00:23:58.976 --> 00:24:00.217]  Another major health threat.
[00:24:00.237 --> 00:24:05.139]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[00:24:05.219 --> 00:24:07.840]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[00:24:07.900 --> 00:24:14.663]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[00:24:14.943 --> 00:24:17.804]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[00:24:17.944 --> 00:24:20.846]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[00:24:20.866 --> 00:24:22.867]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[00:24:22.907 --> 00:24:25.748]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[00:24:25.828 --> 00:24:31.329]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[00:24:31.549 --> 00:24:35.030]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[00:24:35.050 --> 00:24:38.051]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.

[00:26:12.148 --> 00:26:17.654]  It's stimulating, mind-expanding, safer to use than alcohol.
[00:26:18.494 --> 00:26:19.575]  It's the in thing.
[00:26:20.576 --> 00:26:23.099]  Such are the myths concerning marijuana.
[00:26:24.180 --> 00:26:29.005]  Myths that lull thousands of young people into experimenting with obnoxious weed.
[00:26:29.025 --> 00:26:34.009]  Marijuana, the burning weed with its roots in hell.
[00:26:34.833 --> 00:26:36.314]  Should marijuana be legalized?
[00:26:36.674 --> 00:26:38.574]  We'll debate the pros and cons right now.
[00:26:38.815 --> 00:26:41.456]  Marijuana leads to doing worse things.
[00:26:41.496 --> 00:26:42.296]  That's just a fact.
[00:26:42.336 --> 00:26:43.496]  I don't care what anybody says.
[00:26:43.516 --> 00:26:50.579]  The drug war is a total failure and the federal drug war ought to be revisited and for the most part gotten rid of.
[00:26:50.819 --> 00:26:59.102]  This has corrupted our government, it has destroyed our due process, and it is withholding from people medicine that is very effective, and we need to stop it.
[00:26:59.483 --> 00:27:01.663]  We need to roll prohibition back right now.
[00:27:01.683 --> 00:27:08.786]  Marijuana is natural, you know, there's so many different things that you can use it for, including, you know, helping cancer patients.
[00:27:09.126 --> 00:27:12.868]  I'm a Christian minister, and I believe, you know, Jesus would be okay with it.
[00:27:13.228 --> 00:27:29.779]  There have been studies proven that children who have 400 seizures a day, that's intense, that's like a seizure a minute, who can't stop just violently convulsing, have been helped and have stopped having seizures of like two to three days after applying the cannabinoid oil treatment to themselves, like in their food or something like that.
[00:27:30.119 --> 00:27:31.019]  Like that's incredible!
[00:27:31.300 --> 00:27:33.501]  There's proof of that, like it's all over the internet.
[00:27:33.561 --> 00:27:43.746]  The mandatory minimums, locking people up for non-violent crimes for very long periods of time, where there's no discretion for the fact that they were non-violent, that this is their first offense.
[00:27:43.806 --> 00:27:45.167]  No, just lock them up.
[00:27:45.327 --> 00:27:49.509]  You two-bit heroes, making life miserable for innocent children.
[00:27:50.029 --> 00:27:51.550]  Why don't you go out and hunt real criminals?
[00:27:51.890 --> 00:27:53.371]  We got a tip on this drag race.
[00:27:53.391 --> 00:27:55.172]  Like when we found the marijuana.
[00:27:55.805 --> 00:27:57.286]  Well, sir, that's a very serious charge.
[00:27:57.306 --> 00:28:22.946]  Think about the tens of billions of dollars that Big Pharma makes a year, with close to 20% of the population being on antidepressants, when every major study shows that marijuana absolutely destroys depression in people, and Prozac can't even prove that it has any measurable positive effect, and they have to put on the insert that it may make you commit suicide.
[00:28:23.226 --> 00:28:28.613]  Things like alcohol kill people daily, and it's legal because it can be taxed.
[00:28:28.853 --> 00:28:30.856]  Happy to deliver alcohol.
[00:28:31.797 --> 00:28:32.999]  But weed is illegal, right?
[00:28:33.119 --> 00:28:35.141]  Hey bud, let's party!
[00:28:42.858 --> 00:28:45.639]  I do think, however, that the pharmaceutical companies should stay away.
[00:28:45.999 --> 00:28:47.160]  Like, just keep it natural.
[00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:49.821]  Let's have the sun out, you know, like, roasting seeds in the dirt.
[00:28:50.261 --> 00:28:51.482]  You know, like, just stay away.
[00:28:51.542 --> 00:28:52.483]  You know, let it be.
[00:28:52.583 --> 00:28:53.863]  You know, like, let it grow organically.
[00:28:53.923 --> 00:28:55.744]  And, like, that's what will help people.
[00:28:55.804 --> 00:29:00.186]  It definitely should not be legal because that's helping us make money on the streets.
[00:29:00.426 --> 00:29:01.247]  End probation.
[00:29:01.387 --> 00:29:01.887]  That's right!
[00:29:01.927 --> 00:29:02.107]  Peace!
[00:29:02.447 --> 00:29:03.348]  What's the obstacle?
[00:29:03.408 --> 00:29:04.748]  What the hell is stopping it?
[00:29:04.768 --> 00:29:06.509]  Why is Texas taking so long?
[00:29:06.549 --> 00:29:07.590]  Because we're in Texas, dude.
[00:29:07.630 --> 00:29:07.990]  Yeah.
[00:29:08.550 --> 00:29:10.451]  They haven't figured out how to make money off of it yet.
[00:29:10.471 --> 00:29:11.951]  They're looking at all the benefits.
[00:29:11.971 --> 00:29:13.552]  They're so fucking right-wing.
[00:29:13.852 --> 00:29:15.573]  They don't care about the health benefits.
[00:29:15.873 --> 00:29:18.414]  They know that we're making so much money off the cancer and whatnot.
[00:29:18.994 --> 00:29:20.034]  They want us to be unhealthy.
[00:29:20.074 --> 00:29:21.995]  There's so many benefits for something that's natural.
[00:29:22.015 --> 00:29:26.697]  We need to look more into natural medicines and not things that are scientifically made in a lab.
[00:29:26.837 --> 00:29:28.117]  This is not reefer madness.
[00:29:28.137 --> 00:29:40.559]  This is one big industry that has political clout trying to shut down another industry that basically has a product that grows freely and is not owned by anybody.
[00:29:40.679 --> 00:29:43.240]  I don't want the government regulating my marijuana.
[00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:44.980]  Right now they're regulating you.
[00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:46.761]  They'll arrest you if you smoke it.
[00:29:46.861 --> 00:29:47.681]  That's regulation.
[00:29:48.001 --> 00:29:49.561]  But only if I get caught.
[00:29:49.741 --> 00:29:51.761]  Look at what the pharmaceutical companies are doing.
[00:29:51.981 --> 00:29:54.782]  They want to take away our informed consent
[00:29:55.990 --> 00:30:02.838]  And violate the Nuremberg Code, saying that they can inject us with whatever they deem to be necessary at any given time.
[00:30:02.898 --> 00:30:05.380]  We should be very, very concerned about this.
[00:30:05.400 --> 00:30:13.770]  I didn't know you were a weedhead, Tony.
[00:30:15.191 --> 00:30:15.932]  All my friends are.

[00:30:53.558 --> 00:30:55.399]  We'll see you here tomorrow at 7 p.m.
[00:30:55.499 --> 00:30:55.920]  Central.
[00:31:00.803 --> 00:31:07.968]  From the water table to our soils to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[00:31:08.068 --> 00:31:10.230]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[00:31:10.430 --> 00:31:15.614]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[00:31:15.774 --> 00:31:20.878]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[00:31:20.998 --> 00:31:24.101]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[00:31:24.381 --> 00:31:28.305]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[00:31:28.525 --> 00:31:32.849]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[00:31:32.929 --> 00:31:43.038]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[00:31:43.279 --> 00:31:45.841]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs,
[00:31:46.141 --> 00:31:54.194]  Manufactured in the USA, the new InfoWars Life Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.
[00:31:54.355 --> 00:31:58.361]  Now available exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[00:32:11.926 --> 00:32:19.892]  I saw the InfoWars on feminism when Cytheria got gang-raped and I was really upset about that.
[00:32:19.972 --> 00:32:26.257]  They were talking about how Anita Scorsese hasn't commented on it at all.
[00:32:27.738 --> 00:32:35.721]  I'm like, yeah, her focus is really, like, Gamergate, but it's still part of, like, the bigger picture as a whole.
[00:32:36.381 --> 00:32:37.881]  And, like, it was kind of upsetting.
[00:32:38.461 --> 00:32:41.142]  I'm just kind of like, hey, why didn't we talk about that?
[00:32:41.202 --> 00:32:44.203]  Like, why is there a big stigma around sex workers?
[00:32:44.723 --> 00:32:48.564]  And why did I find out about it through, like, sites like Chicks on the Right?
[00:32:48.604 --> 00:32:50.805]  Like, that was really surprising.
[00:32:50.905 --> 00:32:52.906]  And I don't like that it's, like, been used to
[00:32:54.127 --> 00:33:01.790]  further perpetuate this like this negative connotation on the idea of what feminism is which is like equality.
[00:33:01.810 --> 00:33:18.458]  You have the feminists who think you know they see the Sports Illustrated swimsuit cover they think it's a great celebration of women's bodies fitness and all that and then you also have the other ones or at least another type of feminists that they call themselves saying that it's objectifying and it's horrible and it's all these other things.
[00:33:18.698 --> 00:33:21.759]  Yeah, you know, I think there's something to be said about that.
[00:33:22.340 --> 00:33:42.128]  As a feminist, I identify, I don't think it's my personal responsibility to tell someone else who they should be and what they should do, and I really think it's defeating the purpose when we go around pointing out who's more feminist than the other person, and who's more liberal, or who's more right-wing, or whatever.
[00:33:43.368 --> 00:34:06.462]  You guys are forgetting like the idea which is like it's supposed to be a quality and it's a humanist issue because it's yes America has pretty we're pretty free as far as females go but there are people around the world little girls that get like sold into a marriage like they're seven years old and then like you look at little boys like the Quran talks about betting little boys it's like a common practice
[00:34:07.102 --> 00:34:09.183]  You know, that's f***ed up!
[00:34:09.243 --> 00:34:10.823]  I'm not down with child trafficking.
[00:34:11.384 --> 00:34:12.824]  Yeah, we talk about that stuff too.
[00:34:12.864 --> 00:34:15.565]  We talk about the rape and mutilation of women in the Middle East.
[00:34:15.905 --> 00:34:19.147]  Saudi Arabian women being called terrorists for being able to drive.
[00:34:19.347 --> 00:34:20.667]  Back to Cosmopolitan.
[00:34:20.687 --> 00:34:26.209]  Cosmopolitan represents a time right now where we're in a transitional period as a country.
[00:34:26.770 --> 00:34:30.351]  Women haven't had rights for very long and we're still in that transitional.
[00:34:30.411 --> 00:34:32.552]  It's not Star Trek where everybody's cool.
[00:34:32.832 --> 00:34:33.852]  Talking about Gamergate.
[00:34:34.053 --> 00:34:34.933]  Can you explain that to me?
[00:34:36.068 --> 00:34:47.492]  Um, well, as far as, as my understanding is that, like, Anita Skarzizian has started a conversation which is, um, there is sexual objectification of women in video games.
[00:34:47.972 --> 00:34:53.034]  And, you know, it anatomically doesn't make sense for a female warrior to have giant breasts.
[00:34:53.074 --> 00:34:55.015]  Like, you know, that's the deal.
[00:34:55.075 --> 00:34:56.495]  And I can, I can understand that.
[00:34:56.736 --> 00:35:03.238]  Um, but at the same time, it's like, you know, it's a freedom of expression as far as video games go.
[00:35:04.078 --> 00:35:19.208]  Um, and I do think that there needs to be more, like, positive video games for women, because, you know, it's not always about clothes, and it's really discouraging, I think, for little girls to just be constantly bombarded with, you know, take care of the baby doll, take care of your clothes.
[00:35:19.248 --> 00:35:21.310]  What about, what about characters like Metroid?
[00:35:22.130 --> 00:35:26.513]  Characters like Metroid, yeah, we need more strong female characters.
[00:35:26.553 --> 00:35:33.438]  Basically from my understanding what you're saying is Gamergate was pretty much a way to get more positive female characters in video games?
[00:35:33.638 --> 00:35:44.005]  No, Gamergate, they have a big issue because as to my understanding she started a conversation about sexual objectification in women.
[00:35:44.845 --> 00:35:49.550]  Um, and there was a backlash from the men of Gamer Gay and, like, other video games.
[00:35:49.591 --> 00:35:50.812]  They had a big problem with it.
[00:35:50.832 --> 00:35:52.333]  They didn't like what she was starting.
[00:35:52.353 --> 00:35:56.858]  Um, and then they decided to put her information out to the world.
[00:35:57.059 --> 00:35:58.800]  Her private, personal information.
[00:35:58.820 --> 00:36:00.142]  Okay, so that's where the gay came in.
[00:36:00.342 --> 00:36:22.394]  Yeah, well, and like, you know, as a person, like, if you were somebody and you just, like, wanted to talk about something on YouTube and, like, start a conversation about something, and then to have someone hack into your personal stuff and then put your information out there and then experience death threats on a 24-7 basis, like, she couldn't give a speech in a college because somebody said that they would
[00:36:22.734 --> 00:36:24.875]  There would be a shooting worse than Kent State.
[00:36:25.095 --> 00:36:26.096]  That's scary.
[00:36:26.136 --> 00:36:27.136]  That's f***ed up.
[00:36:27.316 --> 00:36:28.437]  Okay, so that's what it was.
[00:36:28.497 --> 00:36:29.778]  It wasn't so much what she was saying.
[00:36:29.798 --> 00:36:31.258]  It's like how people reacted to it.
[00:36:31.318 --> 00:36:31.919]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:36:31.959 --> 00:36:38.942]  Like it's not so much like, you know, I don't think she's like campaigning to like, you know, come down on men.
[00:36:39.042 --> 00:36:43.824]  She's just asking, hey, can you really think about how you're treating me as a human being?
[00:36:52.700 --> 00:36:58.482]  Used since before the days of the Roman Empire to support the body's natural systems and enhance overall health.
[00:36:58.802 --> 00:37:11.105]  Introducing the new Infowarslife.com Oil of Oregano Formulation, a highly advanced nutraceutical form of this key herb that has been traditionally used by civilizations for thousands of years to promote health.
[00:37:11.345 --> 00:37:16.547]  We have now procured the most high quality and potent forms of oregano oil on the market.
[00:37:16.867 --> 00:37:22.454]  Sourced from top leading manufacturers to ensure a concentrated level of bioactive ingredients.
[00:37:22.814 --> 00:37:27.639]  Extracted directly from the wild herb and sealed in easy to use capsules.
[00:37:27.780 --> 00:37:31.364]  You will no longer need to endure the burning of liquid oregano on the tongue.
[00:37:31.704 --> 00:37:37.968]  Wild crafted from the Mediterranean oregano species that experts agree is one of the most powerful and most challenging to acquire.
[00:37:38.308 --> 00:37:43.291]  This winter season, it's more important than ever to secure this true form of oil of oregano.
[00:37:43.471 --> 00:37:46.993]  Now available in our limited first run at Infowarslife.com.
[00:37:47.193 --> 00:37:49.114]  That's Infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:38:03.800 --> 00:38:06.121]  Leanne McAdoo reporting for InfoWars.com.
[00:38:06.241 --> 00:38:09.984]  I'm out here at South by Southwest and we just saw some tweets on Twitter.
[00:38:10.384 --> 00:38:15.146]  People were saying that the Black Panthers are out here doing an open carry march.
[00:38:15.807 --> 00:38:22.771]  So obviously we gotta go try and find these guys and of course see what the people out here at South by Southwest think about a bunch of guns in their face.
[00:38:26.028 --> 00:38:27.449]  They started the war.
[00:38:27.810 --> 00:38:31.252]  A lot of people like to say, this might start a race war.
[00:38:31.312 --> 00:38:43.702]  But we would like to say, the race war started when he bust the first black man upside the head in Africa, in truckers over here in chains.
[00:38:54.659 --> 00:38:55.901]  Who is the real criminal?
[00:38:56.501 --> 00:38:57.923]  Who is the real gangbanger?
[00:38:59.385 --> 00:39:05.693]  When they can't drag our people, bust them upside the head, make them pick cotton, and build this country?
[00:39:06.494 --> 00:39:08.136]  Please, tell us your manifesto.
[00:39:09.784 --> 00:39:20.111]  So, essentially what we're doing here, this is the Huey P. Newton Gun Club, and we're just demonstrating, number one, our gun rights, and number two, we're taking a position against police brutality, which we say is euphemism for police terrorism.
[00:39:20.431 --> 00:39:25.895]  Okay, so what do you want to say to people who think that open carry and things like this is promoting violence?
[00:39:26.687 --> 00:39:28.768]  There's nothing violent about bearing arms.
[00:39:28.808 --> 00:39:29.828]  There's nothing violent.
[00:39:29.868 --> 00:39:33.189]  In fact, over 99% of America bears arms.
[00:39:33.609 --> 00:39:35.230]  And so that's not anything violent.
[00:39:35.390 --> 00:39:38.731]  The fact that we're telling people that they do have rights, there's nothing violent about that.
[00:39:38.751 --> 00:39:41.312]  That's just simply educating them about the rights that they do have.
[00:39:42.152 --> 00:39:49.095]  And what's been the response from all the people out here, probably a global audience, seeing, witnessing this happening, which is incredible.
[00:39:49.455 --> 00:39:50.275]  What's been the response?
[00:39:50.862 --> 00:39:53.303]  Essentially, the people have been very supportive.
[00:39:53.583 --> 00:39:55.003]  We've been allowed to educate the people.
[00:39:55.364 --> 00:40:00.145]  And so, that's our first and foremost position, is make sure people understand what and why we're doing what we're doing.
[00:40:00.485 --> 00:40:06.047]  And today's demonstration was all about dealing with the issues of police brutality, which we say is euphemism for police terrorism.
[00:40:06.447 --> 00:40:08.268]  Here we go again!
[00:40:08.708 --> 00:40:10.289]  Same old s**t again!
[00:40:10.449 --> 00:40:12.369]  Same old s**t again!
[00:40:12.489 --> 00:40:13.890]  Marching down the avenue!
[00:40:14.450 --> 00:40:18.751]  Marching down the avenue!
[00:40:18.771 --> 00:40:20.292]  20 more weeks and we'll be through!
[00:40:21.414 --> 00:40:22.555]  Black Power!
[00:40:23.496 --> 00:40:24.256]  Black Power!
[00:40:24.296 --> 00:40:26.058]  Black Power!
[00:40:26.098 --> 00:40:27.599]  Black Power!
[00:40:27.799 --> 00:40:31.262]  Black Power!
[00:40:31.463 --> 00:40:32.483]  This is not a game!
[00:40:32.784 --> 00:40:33.724]  This is not a joke!
[00:40:33.764 --> 00:40:39.089]  We're not here to play with these people!
[00:40:39.109 --> 00:40:48.257]  Because you can pray all you want to, and when you get up off your knees, and you find out it's a cracker with a pin in their head, still controlling your destiny, guess what?
[00:40:48.717 --> 00:40:49.538]  Still got a problem.
[00:40:50.731 --> 00:40:58.277]  We haven't joined Open Carry Texas, and primarily the reason is because their issue is primarily dealing with gun rights, whereas our issue is a little bit different.
[00:40:58.558 --> 00:41:00.619]  We're taking a position against police brutality.
[00:41:00.880 --> 00:41:10.508]  I think we favor some gun rights, and we do have some connections with that, but our primary position against police brutality, fratricide, is the issue that exists specifically in the black and brown poor communities.
[00:41:11.215 --> 00:41:14.737]  And please forgive me, are you guys Black Panthers or the new Black Panthers?
[00:41:14.757 --> 00:41:16.658]  No, we're the Huey P. Newton Gun Club.
[00:41:16.898 --> 00:41:17.319]  Thank you!
[00:41:17.499 --> 00:41:18.499]  Yes ma'am.
[00:41:18.519 --> 00:41:19.680]  Could you say that again?
[00:41:19.800 --> 00:41:22.902]  Huey P. Newton, who was the founder of the Black Panther Party.
[00:41:23.222 --> 00:41:25.264]  Huey P. Newton Gun Club.
[00:41:25.984 --> 00:41:30.026]  Telling us to go protest peacefully!
[00:41:30.086 --> 00:41:33.008]  When 9-11 happened, you didn't say nothing but no damn peace!
[00:41:35.109 --> 00:41:39.052]  When the Revolutionary War was taking place, I didn't hear nothing but no peace!
[00:41:41.906 --> 00:41:45.029]  In nature, everything has a defense mechanism.
[00:41:45.669 --> 00:41:47.371]  You cannot survive without one.
[00:41:48.452 --> 00:41:53.716]  So the nature has been stripped out of our people, big with a will.
[00:41:54.116 --> 00:41:55.117]  I'm going to make a name!
[00:41:56.238 --> 00:41:57.279]  I'm going to make a name!
[00:41:58.380 --> 00:41:59.421]  I'm going to make a name!
[00:42:01.483 --> 00:42:03.524]  A pig is a pig, that's what I said!
[00:42:05.666 --> 00:42:07.608]  The only good pig is the pig I said!
[00:42:09.755 --> 00:42:11.756]  The only good pig is the pig gasket!
[00:42:12.536 --> 00:42:15.337]  Did you guys see the Black Panther march coming through this way?
[00:42:16.377 --> 00:42:17.617]  With the Open Carry Rally?
[00:42:17.637 --> 00:42:19.138]  What do you guys think about that?
[00:42:19.678 --> 00:42:21.219]  Do you think that's setting the right tone?
[00:42:21.239 --> 00:42:23.139]  What do you think?
[00:42:24.079 --> 00:42:30.081]  I know what I think, but... Are you guys, I mean, do you appreciate some of the messages there, or?
[00:42:31.622 --> 00:42:33.922]  I know you guys are okay with the Open Carry.
[00:42:34.282 --> 00:42:36.343]  They, I mean, you are... We're just here to keep everybody safe.
[00:42:37.083 --> 00:42:37.563]  Yes.
[00:42:38.144 --> 00:42:38.844]  That's all we do.
[00:42:39.960 --> 00:42:48.009]  Do you feel like that further divides the people against the police and the job that you all do to protect?
[00:42:50.652 --> 00:42:50.873]  No.
[00:42:51.493 --> 00:42:52.114]  Yes.
[00:42:52.755 --> 00:42:53.856]  No comment.
[00:42:53.936 --> 00:42:54.977]  Nobody seems divided.
[00:43:04.803 --> 00:43:08.228]  Nobody seems divided.
[00:43:08.268 --> 00:43:09.550]  What about their champ?
[00:43:15.572 --> 00:43:17.172]  The white man loves to throw a rock!
[00:43:45.669 --> 00:43:47.597]  It did hide his bloody hand.
[00:43:48.741 --> 00:43:49.645]  You must remember that.
[00:43:50.732 --> 00:43:52.332]  Are y'all with me?
[00:43:52.352 --> 00:43:52.773]  Yes, sir!
[00:43:52.793 --> 00:43:53.513]  I don't hear you.
[00:43:53.533 --> 00:43:54.133]  Are y'all with me?
[00:43:54.153 --> 00:43:54.993]  Yes, sir!
[00:43:55.573 --> 00:44:02.995]  What do you think that this effect, that this is going to have to make people join your cause or, you know, what do you think this will do?
[00:44:03.376 --> 00:44:07.377]  We hope that they would join our cause and at the very least be very supportive of our cause.
[00:44:07.997 --> 00:44:11.578]  And like I said, our primary concern is to educate the people.
[00:44:11.618 --> 00:44:14.879]  First and foremost, we're not out here to promote violence or anything of that nature.
[00:44:15.199 --> 00:44:15.579]  However,
[00:44:15.999 --> 00:44:17.740]  We think that we do have a right to bear arms.
[00:44:17.760 --> 00:44:19.020]  We're going to bear arms.
[00:44:19.040 --> 00:44:20.861]  We're going to have our constitutional right.
[00:44:20.901 --> 00:44:24.803]  And we're going to educate people about police brutality, which we say, again, is a euphemism for police terrorism.
[00:44:25.203 --> 00:44:32.245]  We are here to let everybody know in this country, we will not sit back on our hands, peacefully.
[00:44:33.046 --> 00:44:37.568]  We will defend ourselves by any means necessary.
