[00:00:05.666 --> 00:00:12.049]  It didn't take long for the New World Order pawns to rally around their color revolution financier, George Soros.
[00:00:12.409 --> 00:00:19.732]  On Monday, Obama's State Department criticized Russia's decision to evict George Soros' Open Society Foundation.
[00:00:20.032 --> 00:00:32.198]  State Department spokesman Mark Toner said, Today's designation of the Open Society Foundations and the Open Society Institute Assistance Foundation as so-called undesirable organizations
[00:00:32.478 --> 00:00:38.419]  We'll only further restrict the work of civil society in Russia for the benefit of the Russian people.
[00:00:38.659 --> 00:00:49.962]  Toner continued, this action is yet another example of the Russian government's growing crackdown on independent voices and a deliberate step to further isolate the Russian people from the world.
[00:00:50.202 --> 00:00:57.283]  In November, Russia put the Open Society Foundations and the Open Society Institute Assistance Foundation on a stop list.
[00:00:57.583 --> 00:01:00.005]  of undesirable foreign NGOs.
[00:01:00.305 --> 00:01:13.697]  Reuters reports Russia's General Prosecutor's Office said the Soros outfits represent a threat to the foundations of the constitutional system of the Russian Federation and the security of the state.
[00:01:13.877 --> 00:01:23.525]  The Soros, quote, pro-democracy, end quote, track record includes underwriting color revolutions and stirring up social unrest in Serbia, Georgia,
[00:01:23.985 --> 00:01:25.126]  We're good to go.
[00:01:46.002 --> 00:01:48.203]  I know that something is going to happen.
[00:01:48.463 --> 00:01:50.124]  This is the case in Ukraine.
[00:01:50.365 --> 00:02:00.810]  When George argued that democracy is the most important thing, and when he says that European values are the most important, and that is why we must accept millions of refugees every year.
[00:02:01.051 --> 00:02:01.971]  How will it end?
[00:02:02.231 --> 00:02:03.432]  Probably as usual.
[00:02:03.852 --> 00:02:11.298]  Fires, riots, overthrowing governments and total destabilization in Europe, more or less as it ended up recently in Ukraine.
[00:02:11.578 --> 00:02:27.050]  In May 2014, Soros told CNN's Fareed Zakaria he is responsible for establishing a foundation in Ukraine that ultimately contributed to the overthrow of the country's elected leader and the installation of a junta handpicked by the State Department.
[00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:39.557]  William F. Jasper of the New American Rights, the IRF founded and funded by Soros, boasts that it has given more than any other donor organization to democratic transformation of Ukraine.
[00:02:39.717 --> 00:02:56.726]  Vladimir Putin said in a speech before a meeting of the Russian Security Council in November, we see the tragic consequences of the so-called color revolutions and ordeals survived by the peoples of the states that faced these irresponsible experiments of covert and sometimes even overt
[00:02:56.926 --> 00:02:57.366]  I don't think so.
[00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:30.836]  A Black Lives Matter supporter who threatened to massacre 16 white students as part of a revenge attack for the shooting of Chicago teen Laquan McDonald has been allowed to return to campus by a federal judge.
[00:03:30.856 --> 00:03:34.461]  21-year-old Jabari Dean had written on social media,
[00:03:34.781 --> 00:03:36.022]  This is my only warning.
[00:03:36.302 --> 00:03:36.962]  At 10 a.m.
[00:03:37.042 --> 00:03:40.343]  on Monday morning, I'm going to the campus of the University of Chicago.
[00:03:40.683 --> 00:03:45.185]  I will be armed with an M4 carbine and two Desert Eagles, all fully loaded.
[00:03:45.425 --> 00:03:49.267]  I will execute approximately 16 white male students.
[00:03:49.447 --> 00:03:53.948]  I then will die killing any number of white policemen that I can in the process.
[00:03:54.309 --> 00:03:55.329]  This is not a joke.
[00:03:55.669 --> 00:03:58.670]  I am to do my part to rid the world of the white devils.
[00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:01.011]  I expect you to do the same.
[00:04:01.331 --> 00:04:02.132]  The post stated.
[00:04:02.332 --> 00:04:02.592]  That
[00:04:03.132 --> 00:04:09.927]  In a nutshell, is what you can expect resulting from the dirty deeds of one George Soros.
[00:04:10.368 --> 00:04:12.452]  John Bowne for Infowars.com
[00:04:24.701 --> 00:04:30.863]  General, what do you think about the FBI saying that there was a terror alert on Monday about a potential forfeiture situation?
[00:04:30.883 --> 00:04:34.224]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[00:04:34.324 --> 00:04:35.924]  Here we go, folks, I'm being assaulted!
[00:04:35.964 --> 00:04:42.206]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the nightly news, InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[00:04:42.326 --> 00:04:48.228]  Is this another false flag stage attack to take our civil liberties and put more homeless security by sticking their hands down on the streets?
[00:04:48.368 --> 00:04:52.130]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:55.252]  And that's what PrisonPlanet.TV is designed to do.
[00:04:55.412 --> 00:05:03.397]  You watch the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels.
[00:05:03.677 --> 00:05:05.718]  What we see now is a war against reality.
[00:05:05.778 --> 00:05:06.819]  It's a war against the truth.
[00:05:07.179 --> 00:05:15.927]  It's more vital than ever that supporters of freedom become members of PrisonPlanet.tv and share their membership with up to 11 friends and family.
