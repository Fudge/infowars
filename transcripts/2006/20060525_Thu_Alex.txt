[00:00:05.953 --> 00:00:06.593]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.253 --> 00:00:08.334]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:09.034 --> 00:00:10.154]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.794 --> 00:00:11.614]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.354 --> 00:00:13.295]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.935 --> 00:00:17.555]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.116 --> 00:00:22.176]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:35.271 --> 00:00:35.753]  Yeah.
[00:00:43.985 --> 00:00:45.205]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:45.245 --> 00:00:49.606]  Welcome to this 25th of May, 2006 Thursday edition.
[00:00:49.666 --> 00:00:51.127]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:00:51.147 --> 00:01:00.969]  We're going to be live here for the next three hours, and we've been having guests almost every day for the last few weeks, but we don't have any schedule today.
[00:01:01.409 --> 00:01:10.451]  I want to be able to take a lot of your phone calls in the first, second, and third hour on the developments in Iran, on Israel's Olmert,
[00:01:11.051 --> 00:01:24.318]  Their new Prime Minister demanding that we attack Iran for them on all the bribery scandals that are breaking concerning Dennis Hastert, Speaker of the House, Duke Cunningham, and many many others.
[00:01:25.339 --> 00:01:31.021]  I think that's blackmail and frankly I think the main culprit we can look at is Israel.
[00:01:31.902 --> 00:01:35.624]  I have studied how Israel operates and it's one of their specialties.
[00:01:36.332 --> 00:01:42.517]  But it's certainly pressure on the Congress to pass these very unpopular agendas.
[00:01:42.577 --> 00:01:45.479]  We'll be getting into that today.
[00:01:46.199 --> 00:01:49.402]  There's a whole host of issues and you're welcome to call in at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:01:49.422 --> 00:01:51.043]  That's 1-800-259-9231 and we will get you up and on the air.
[00:02:05.256 --> 00:02:06.777]  There is so much to discuss here.
[00:02:06.797 --> 00:02:15.401]  In the last few days, Hastert has told President Bush that FBI raid was unconstitutional and violated the separation of powers.
[00:02:16.782 --> 00:02:27.988]  And it is very unconstitutional that we have seen more and more federal executive pressure being brought to bear on the Congress during the anthrax attack.
[00:02:28.028 --> 00:02:32.731]  There were armed troops in there questioning and interrogating members of Congress.
[00:02:33.351 --> 00:02:39.197]  There have been leaks in Congress concerning spying and Valerie Plame and a host of other issues.
[00:02:39.657 --> 00:02:44.802]  FBI's been in there threatening and intimidating members of Congress, setting a really dangerous precedent.
[00:02:44.842 --> 00:02:49.867]  I mean, you don't see Congress generally over-threatening to arrest the President, do you?
[00:02:49.947 --> 00:02:52.790]  You know that only happens after an impeachment.
[00:02:53.795 --> 00:02:58.301]  And then that would be done by a grand jury after the president had been impeached.
[00:02:58.381 --> 00:03:03.207]  So we have a lot of jockeying going on and we'll be getting into that.
[00:03:05.488 --> 00:03:09.553]  Remember just a few days ago over the weekend, FBI searches Congressman's office.
[00:03:09.593 --> 00:03:14.518]  Representative William Jefferson is focus of federal bribery probe.
[00:03:14.698 --> 00:03:17.742]  FBI agents were on Capitol Hill Saturday searching the office.
[00:03:17.782 --> 00:03:27.012]  Representative William Jefferson as part of a bribery investigation into Louisiana Democrat government officials said, and this scared Hastert and others,
[00:03:28.064 --> 00:03:35.590]  And they're now reporting that the Abramoff lobbying bribery scandal does lead to Hastert.
[00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:44.617]  Now, this first broke in the alternative patriot media about a year ago, before Abramoff had even really gotten into deep, deep hot water.
[00:03:45.478 --> 00:03:54.325]  And then about, what, three months ago, it was in the Village Voice, and then it was in Salon, two borderline mainstream liberal publications.
[00:03:55.094 --> 00:03:56.334]  Both listing Hastert.
[00:03:57.115 --> 00:04:06.058]  And now we have an ABC News report that will be playing after the break, where they reported that he is a subject of an investigation.
[00:04:06.498 --> 00:04:10.059]  Now there have been denials concerning this.
[00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:18.602]  Continuing, we have an LA Times report here about Vice President Dick Cheney might testify in the Scooter Libby case.
[00:04:19.847 --> 00:04:24.588]  And a lot more coming up concerning spying on the American people.
[00:04:25.288 --> 00:04:31.389]  Leave spy judgments to government officials say that we shouldn't worry about anything.
[00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:32.670]  It's up to their discretion.
[00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:34.770]  There's basically no constitution.
[00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:37.790]  Just leave it all up to them.
[00:04:38.351 --> 00:04:41.411]  So we'll cover that as well after this quick break.
[00:04:41.451 --> 00:04:44.212]  But I'm going to go to your calls in the next segment.
[00:04:44.232 --> 00:04:45.432]  I'm going to take a lot of calls.
[00:04:46.127 --> 00:04:49.209]  We've been getting better and better about this, but I'm going to blow the roof off today.
[00:04:49.649 --> 00:04:53.612]  I want to take 50 calls in the next three hours.
[00:04:53.632 --> 00:04:54.252]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:04:55.853 --> 00:04:57.214]  Let's have a free-for-all.
[00:04:57.274 --> 00:04:58.194]  It's going to be interesting.
[00:05:01.576 --> 00:05:05.919]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:05:06.099 --> 00:05:10.442]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:05:14.216 --> 00:05:15.477]  A new world order can emerge.
[00:05:15.497 --> 00:05:16.478]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:05:31.952 --> 00:05:42.300]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:47.944]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.
[00:05:48.425 --> 00:05:51.827]  Visit Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[00:05:51.847 --> 00:05:52.188]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:05:52.208 --> 00:05:53.509]  Order today and spread the word!
[00:06:01.178 --> 00:06:04.440]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:08.682]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[00:06:08.942 --> 00:06:11.724]  But, if you place them on the magnet, all would stick.
[00:06:11.924 --> 00:06:14.325]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[00:06:14.505 --> 00:06:23.150]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:24.691]  The Berkeley Light is different.
[00:06:24.891 --> 00:06:29.053]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[00:06:29.153 --> 00:06:29.814]  We're good to go!
[00:06:48.476 --> 00:06:48.977]  We're good to go.
[00:07:00.859 --> 00:07:06.843]  I used to be ashamed of my toenails, so I thought I was destined to wear tennis shoes through the heat of the summer and hide my toes at the beach.
[00:07:07.263 --> 00:07:09.925]  And then my podiatrist told me about Non-X Nail Gel.
[00:07:10.085 --> 00:07:14.708]  It tackles unsightly nails by clearing out the cause of the problem, yellowing keratin debris buildup.
[00:07:14.868 --> 00:07:19.672]  With regular use, Non-X Gel breaks down and removes the debris, so toenails look clear.
[00:07:19.872 --> 00:07:24.595]  This summer I'm wearing open-toed sandals again, thanks to a topical natural gel called Non-X.
[00:07:24.815 --> 00:07:27.497]  If your toenails are embarrassing, I recommend Non-X Nail Gel.
[00:07:27.737 --> 00:07:30.619]  It's at your pharmacy or mass retailer in the foot care section.
[00:07:31.899 --> 00:07:32.919]  Looking for profits?
[00:07:32.979 --> 00:07:34.360]  Looking for safety and security?
[00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:37.560]  The $10 Olympic commemorative gold coin offers both.
[00:07:37.961 --> 00:07:45.522]  This low-mintage collector coin, with a total series mintage under $600,000, has sold at four times its current price.
[00:07:45.582 --> 00:07:49.103]  Falling dollar values and inflation make this likely to happen again.
[00:07:49.343 --> 00:07:50.843]  Secure your position today.
[00:07:51.143 --> 00:07:52.363]  Call Midas Resources at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:07:52.424 --> 00:07:52.664]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:08:01.255 --> 00:08:06.278]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:06.658 --> 00:08:08.999]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:19.965 --> 00:08:26.409]  Well, the mainstream media finally picked up on a story that we've been covering for the last year plus.
[00:08:28.135 --> 00:08:34.850]  And that is that almost every committee chairman, almost every senior congressman...
[00:08:35.653 --> 00:08:36.673]  is on the payroll.
[00:08:36.773 --> 00:08:39.414]  In fact, I've talked to a lot of congressmen and women behind the scenes.
[00:08:40.014 --> 00:08:50.897]  If you're not on the payroll, if you're not dirty, you do not get promoted to committee chairman level, or you get run out, or they go after you like they have Congressman Tom Tancredo.
[00:08:50.937 --> 00:09:02.940]  That's even been in Roll Call and other big congressional publications that President Bush openly has got a FOTOA out against him once Tom Tancredo out of office for rallying the American people against the open borders.
[00:09:04.571 --> 00:09:08.192]  So we know that you've got to be dirty, you've got to be on the payroll.
[00:09:08.353 --> 00:09:13.975]  Many of the members of Congress are secret members of the Central Intelligence Agency.
[00:09:14.495 --> 00:09:28.480]  It came out that the outgoing head of the CIA, Porter Goss, who was the head of the House Intelligence Committee for many years, and who was clearly involved in 9-11, with Mahmood Ahmed, the head of Pakistani intelligence, and we get into that in the film.
[00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:29.300]  It's another subject.
[00:09:29.701 --> 00:09:33.062]  The point is, about these individuals,
[00:09:34.547 --> 00:09:39.769]  Is that he had been a secret CIA officer going back in the early 1960s.
[00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:41.710]  It's like President Bush.
[00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:45.492]  He was CIA before he was ever a congressman from Texas.
[00:09:46.092 --> 00:09:57.957]  And then they claim in the mid-70s that it was supposedly the first time he'd ever been in the CIA that he was just magically made Director of Central Intelligence.
[00:09:58.576 --> 00:10:05.323]  And then now we've gotten a hold of documents and other pieces of evidence that he was even involved in the operation at the Bay of Pigs.
[00:10:06.384 --> 00:10:16.554]  So we have this backdrop, and I started out this whole discussion about bribery and corruption in Congress with the statement that this is par for the course.
[00:10:17.615 --> 00:10:20.878]  This is like saying that a sailboat has to have a sail.
[00:10:21.545 --> 00:10:26.127]  I mean, if you're not corrupt, you're not going to be put in a senior position.
[00:10:26.567 --> 00:10:30.669]  And this is what the mafia, what organized crime has done for thousands of years.
[00:10:31.970 --> 00:10:47.317]  You've got to do really heinous crimes, you've got to be dirty, you've got to be in it up to your elbows, or even up to your eyeballs, or sometimes completely submerged in this soup of cess to be moved into the higher ranks.
[00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:52.814]  And they do that because they know you're a crook, they know you're a bird of the feather, they know that you're compromised.
[00:10:52.834 --> 00:10:54.716]  This is just a 101 rule of crime.
[00:10:55.997 --> 00:11:13.571]  That's why at the local level, I always use this analogy, it's the best, police will tell you, criminology, it's 101, that real gangs, real Mexican mafia, real Italian mafia, real Irish mafia, real Jewish mafia, it doesn't matter, but just on the street level thugs,
[00:11:14.658 --> 00:11:16.459]  They may have sold drugs for five years.
[00:11:16.499 --> 00:11:18.039]  They may have robbed ten liquor stores.
[00:11:18.459 --> 00:11:20.339]  They may have already stolen fifty cars.
[00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:37.463]  Before they become a made member of the gang, or get into its ruling council, even at the street thug level, they say, okay, one of the most popular things in Dallas when I was growing up, and of course I heard about similar things in LA in the news, was you gotta go kill an old lady.
[00:11:37.904 --> 00:11:43.225]  An innocent old lady, on a walker, at a bus stop, you gotta pull up and shotgun her in the face.
[00:11:43.245 --> 00:11:43.885]  You gotta kill her.
[00:11:44.887 --> 00:11:49.094]  And in fact, if the old lady doesn't die from a shotgun wound, you've got to go out and kill another old lady.
[00:11:49.715 --> 00:11:58.831]  It's been in the mainstream news that the Mexican Mafia and MS-13 and others right now have to kill a black man.
[00:11:59.574 --> 00:12:00.615]  And that's going on in L.A.
[00:12:00.635 --> 00:12:03.236]  because of turf wars between blacks and Hispanics.
[00:12:03.877 --> 00:12:05.758]  But obviously the Mexican gangs are much bigger.
[00:12:05.778 --> 00:12:08.239]  They're just generally just targeting black families.
[00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:11.381]  And every few days you hear about them killing a bunch of blacks.
[00:12:11.441 --> 00:12:13.643]  And it's just a minor footnote in the back of the paper.
[00:12:13.663 --> 00:12:15.404]  Yeah, machine gun a bunch of black people.
[00:12:15.804 --> 00:12:16.524]  What's the big deal?
[00:12:16.945 --> 00:12:18.526]  So that's going on.
[00:12:19.486 --> 00:12:22.848]  And the Crips, of course, were known for being more evil than the Bloods.
[00:12:22.888 --> 00:12:24.449]  They would have to go out.
[00:12:24.509 --> 00:12:27.731]  Their thing was abduct a woman and then go blow her head off after you rape her.
[00:12:30.467 --> 00:12:33.133]  That's the kind of things that happen.
[00:12:34.495 --> 00:12:35.257]  That go on.
[00:12:35.698 --> 00:12:37.662]  And in Congress, that's how it works.
[00:12:38.243 --> 00:12:53.229]  At first, you're a freshman congressman, you make deals, you do what they say for years, and then suddenly, hey, you get flown on a junket to a lavish five-star hunting resort, there's hookers there, and then, folks, I've talked to congressmen.
[00:12:53.269 --> 00:12:55.610]  This is behind closed doors.
[00:12:55.630 --> 00:13:01.873]  I mean, I've talked to people in politics, high level, a lot of them live here in Austin, and this is how it works, boys and girls.
[00:13:02.894 --> 00:13:03.856]  And, you know, boom!
[00:13:03.896 --> 00:13:08.023]  There's this beautiful, you know, supermodel that just comes into your room.
[00:13:08.844 --> 00:13:11.850]  And you've basically been told, you know, just get into it.
[00:13:11.890 --> 00:13:12.571]  Go along with it.
[00:13:12.591 --> 00:13:14.434]  You've got a few scotch and waters.
[00:13:15.015 --> 00:13:16.117]  You better.
[00:13:16.901 --> 00:13:19.522]  Okay, this is how it starts and then pretty soon.
[00:13:19.562 --> 00:13:28.527]  Hey, there's a defense contract coming down give us a vote on it and Hey, you've got you know your own plastics plant This other defense contractor.
[00:13:28.567 --> 00:13:29.908]  It's a subsidiary of this one.
[00:13:29.928 --> 00:13:37.251]  It's going to give you a big ten million dollar order How's that sound or hey, how about I think you ought to buy this piece of land over here?
[00:13:37.291 --> 00:13:40.873]  It's valued at a hundred thousand, but I bet somebody buy that for eight hundred thousand and
[00:13:41.965 --> 00:13:48.890]  And then suddenly after 5-10 years in there, it's just Swiss bank accounts, in some cases hundreds of millions of dollars.
[00:13:49.351 --> 00:13:51.092]  You're totally selling your country out.
[00:13:52.513 --> 00:13:58.537]  Hookers are as ubiquitous as Michael Rivero said, as water fountains, that's the joke.
[00:13:59.458 --> 00:14:00.899]  It's just total insanity.
[00:14:01.900 --> 00:14:04.762]  And then you get flown into the ranch.
[00:14:06.827 --> 00:14:13.672]  Uh-oh, it isn't five-star hookers, ladies and gentlemen, it's fourteen-year-old girls.
[00:14:14.412 --> 00:14:17.394]  And you're told, you've got to do this, this is when you go to the next level.
[00:14:18.075 --> 00:14:21.657]  And this is what they do, ladies and gentlemen, this is your government.
[00:14:22.658 --> 00:14:35.727]  And it's so evil, it's so out in the open now, that they openly have two lobbyists, one for Dyncor, one for Halliburton, against Chicago Tribune, it's been in other publications now as well,
[00:14:36.553 --> 00:14:41.257]  Who are there lobbying for the white slaverings and lobbying that the U.S.
[00:14:41.337 --> 00:14:50.884]  Army not, they have been trying to stop it, not enforce against Halliburton and Nine Corps openly running these camps in Eastern Europe and it's hundreds of bases in the Middle East.
[00:14:52.225 --> 00:15:03.574]  And some of it isn't sex slavery, some of it they just grab old families and ship them off to slave camps where they live at a subsistence level there all over the world in different sweatshops building Nike tennis shoes.
[00:15:04.446 --> 00:15:14.114]  Or, in other cases, they grab the European babies that you can get $250,000 a piece for, and the family back in the U.S., the middle class family, they give them some baloney story.
[00:15:14.175 --> 00:15:14.975]  This has been in the news.
[00:15:15.396 --> 00:15:17.197]  Oh, your child came from this poor family.
[00:15:17.277 --> 00:15:21.641]  The single mother died of tuberculosis, and here's the healthy baby.
[00:15:21.981 --> 00:15:22.341]  Give us the $250,000.
[00:15:22.522 --> 00:15:25.584]  I'm told it's even more now, and you get the little baby.
[00:15:25.604 --> 00:15:29.708]  You don't know that a woman, you know, a 20-year-old, 18-year-old woman got grabbed.
[00:15:29.728 --> 00:15:31.009]  Her husband had his head blown off.
[00:15:31.959 --> 00:15:40.748]  Or was put in prison, and the woman was sent to Saudi Arabia as a sex slave, and the baby is, or Israel for that matter, or Turkey.
[00:15:41.148 --> 00:15:41.989]  Turkey's real bad.
[00:15:42.009 --> 00:15:43.631]  We haven't been talking enough about them.
[00:15:44.131 --> 00:15:46.494]  And then they fly them out.
[00:15:46.514 --> 00:15:48.015]  And they're just out in the open.
[00:15:48.055 --> 00:15:49.757]  This is just out in the open.
[00:15:51.303 --> 00:15:52.944]  And I guess what comes around goes around.
[00:15:53.184 --> 00:15:56.265]  Whites are the most trafficked in the world right now.
[00:15:56.505 --> 00:15:57.746]  There's a premium on whites.
[00:15:57.826 --> 00:16:01.287]  Culturally, whites have been seen as the elite globally.
[00:16:02.067 --> 00:16:03.288]  You know, the empire builders.
[00:16:03.388 --> 00:16:07.650]  And so these Eastern Europeans and Central Europeans, these are beautiful women.
[00:16:08.470 --> 00:16:11.611]  And I just saw a PBS special on it the other night.
[00:16:11.631 --> 00:16:12.352]  I had to turn it off.
[00:16:12.512 --> 00:16:13.552]  I just couldn't watch it.
[00:16:14.012 --> 00:16:15.673]  This husband trying to get his wife back.
[00:16:15.713 --> 00:16:16.613]  They just kidnapped her.
[00:16:17.074 --> 00:16:17.894]  Took her into Turkey.
[00:16:18.709 --> 00:16:26.052]  Fifteen Turks would rape her a day at least.
[00:16:26.752 --> 00:16:29.813]  Believe me folks, I wouldn't be going around on a cell phone trying to get my wife back.
[00:16:30.974 --> 00:16:35.316]  I'm sure you've seen the Terminator, that's what it would look like.
[00:16:35.656 --> 00:16:39.117]  Full body armor suit, machine guns hanging all over my body.
[00:16:39.137 --> 00:16:40.518]  There would be hell to pay.
[00:16:45.450 --> 00:16:45.730]  I don't know.
[00:16:45.770 --> 00:16:46.451]  Now I'm ranting.
[00:16:46.491 --> 00:16:47.612]  I said I'd go to your calls.
[00:16:47.692 --> 00:16:53.396]  I want to get into this whole bribery scandal, but to do it, you have to get some background here.
[00:16:53.596 --> 00:17:02.502]  Now, the British specialize in blackmail and bribery, but governments do, period.
[00:17:03.423 --> 00:17:08.907]  But really, who's been the most aggressive about it in the last ten years has been the Israelis.
[00:17:10.088 --> 00:17:14.171]  And I see Israeli fingerprints all over
[00:17:15.177 --> 00:17:27.524]  Duke Cuttingham and all over Hastert and all over Cheney and all over Fitzgerald and you got over and over here saying you've got to attack them, you've got to attack them now.
[00:17:28.785 --> 00:17:42.112]  And the Congress is saying 70 plus percent of people don't want it, it's wildly unpopular, we're all about to be removed from office in the next election, even with the help of our electronic machines and 35 percent of the country, we're still losing.
[00:17:43.436 --> 00:17:45.137]  There's about to be a revolution in this country.
[00:17:45.577 --> 00:17:46.278]  We can't do it.
[00:17:46.358 --> 00:17:47.358]  And Israel every day.
[00:17:47.438 --> 00:17:52.301]  Generals, heads of the Knesset, their Prime Minister are just, you're bad.
[00:17:52.341 --> 00:17:55.242]  You can actually read these headlines in Heratz and Jerusalem Post.
[00:17:55.282 --> 00:17:55.822]  You're bad.
[00:17:55.882 --> 00:17:56.663]  You're not good.
[00:17:57.063 --> 00:17:58.024]  America's bad.
[00:17:58.104 --> 00:18:01.665]  You've got to attack Iran for us, or you've got to support us when we attack.
[00:18:02.486 --> 00:18:06.728]  And there's a lot of different indicators, and I've got evidence of this.
[00:18:07.048 --> 00:18:08.629]  We know they blackmailed Bill Clinton.
[00:18:09.668 --> 00:18:18.411]  They couldn't go after him for missile secrets and supercomputers and cocaine dealers in the White House because Israel and the Republicans and the Democrats and the British were all involved in this.
[00:18:18.431 --> 00:18:20.171]  They had to go after him on something that was isolated.
[00:18:20.631 --> 00:18:26.153]  And so it was the admitted Israeli agent, Monica Lewinsky, and that's even been in mainstream news.
[00:18:26.393 --> 00:18:28.274]  It's been leaked out that he was being blackmailed.
[00:18:29.114 --> 00:18:30.834]  Clinton, you know, you're going to do what we say.
[00:18:30.854 --> 00:18:32.115]  You're going to go into these countries.
[00:18:32.135 --> 00:18:33.795]  You're going to give us this aid.
[00:18:34.336 --> 00:18:35.756]  And now it's just full-blown.
[00:18:37.074 --> 00:19:03.998]  And they told Bush, you will put Chertoff in, our dual citizen, you will put him in as Homeland Security head, you will put in almost your entire cabinet will be Israeli double agents, they're admittedly double agents, mainstream news at a special Pentagon office, completely Israeli run, you know, cooked up all their Iraq intelligence and basically runs things, and high-level CIA analysts, and a bunch of generals, Zinni and others are on record saying it, Colin Powell, I mean this is what's going on.
[00:19:04.870 --> 00:19:06.431]  And this is blackmail, folks.
[00:19:07.111 --> 00:19:16.837]  And Hastert and others haven't been... I mean, they only did 95% of what Israel wanted, and Israel is just bullying them, and they're probably going to go ahead and attack Iran.
[00:19:17.637 --> 00:19:18.318]  I mean, it's... Hey!
[00:19:19.058 --> 00:19:21.720]  It's going to come out, you took hundreds of millions of dollars, Hastert.
[00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:26.222]  Now, either... Again, Duke Cunningham, it's 800 plus mil.
[00:19:28.344 --> 00:19:30.525]  So, you want to be indicted like the rest of these people?
[00:19:31.454 --> 00:19:34.897]  Or you get in there, Hastert, you've been kind of backing off, attacking Iran.
[00:19:35.317 --> 00:19:36.858]  You do what you're told, okay?
[00:19:37.739 --> 00:19:40.461]  And you may get removed from office, but at least you'll keep your Swiss bank accounts.
[00:19:40.701 --> 00:19:41.782]  You understand, old man?
[00:19:42.082 --> 00:19:43.963]  You do exactly what we say.
[00:19:44.343 --> 00:19:46.385]  So, I've got a lot of evidence to this.
[00:19:46.425 --> 00:19:51.609]  We'll take calls and we'll get back into more of the evidence on it, but I do see Israel's fingerprints all over this.
[00:19:51.649 --> 00:19:54.231]  And, you know, most people see their fingerprints on everything.
[00:19:54.251 --> 00:19:54.711]  I don't.
[00:19:55.151 --> 00:19:55.812]  I do on this.
[00:19:55.852 --> 00:19:56.812]  This fits their M.O.
[00:19:56.852 --> 00:19:59.514]  and the motive and the way Olbert's behaving.
[00:19:59.694 --> 00:20:00.215]  We'll be right back.
[00:20:02.754 --> 00:20:05.755]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[00:20:06.095 --> 00:20:14.918]  It's portable and requires no water pressure so you can enjoy healthy drinking water whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[00:20:15.238 --> 00:20:19.920]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[00:20:20.380 --> 00:20:27.108]  The Berkelite is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[00:20:27.508 --> 00:20:39.302]  It also removes foul taste and odors, like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals, like lead and mercury, while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:20:39.762 --> 00:20:44.224]  The Murky Lights Rechargeable LED Lighting System is so bright it can be used as a reading light.
[00:20:44.384 --> 00:20:46.725]  Get the Murky Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:20:46.745 --> 00:20:48.706]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:20:48.726 --> 00:20:49.926]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[00:20:49.986 --> 00:20:51.447]  Or order on the web at murkywater.com.
[00:20:51.467 --> 00:20:52.527]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:21:03.536 --> 00:21:04.716]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:21:05.117 --> 00:21:10.598]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[00:21:11.158 --> 00:21:11.659]  That's right.
[00:21:11.979 --> 00:21:14.640]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[00:21:15.660 --> 00:21:21.742]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[00:21:22.316 --> 00:21:30.010]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[00:21:30.451 --> 00:21:35.259]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[00:21:35.922 --> 00:21:40.944]  If you'd like to take a look at gold pre-retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[00:21:41.725 --> 00:21:45.867]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[00:21:46.247 --> 00:21:46.487]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:21:46.527 --> 00:21:47.987]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[00:21:48.007 --> 00:21:48.188]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:21:48.228 --> 00:21:48.508]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:48.608 --> 00:21:50.349]  David J. Smith for NewsWatch Magazine.
[00:22:05.476 --> 00:22:12.159]  Did you know that one goal of international communism was to get our young people's mind off religion by getting along to sex?
[00:22:13.019 --> 00:22:22.763]  By destroying the morals of the younger generation, America would eventually become ripe for revolution without understanding why communism wanted to make young people soft and easily controlled.
[00:22:23.903 --> 00:22:28.965]  Have we witnessed this transformation of our young people away from God and the Bible to immorality?
[00:22:29.665 --> 00:22:37.547]  We'd like to help you understand how these things are coming to pass by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[00:22:38.327 --> 00:22:39.808]  Just call our toll-free number 1-800-516-8736.

[00:22:53.332 --> 00:22:53.892]  Call now!
[00:22:54.073 --> 00:22:56.834]  Operators are standing by to receive your call.
[00:22:59.696 --> 00:23:03.297]  Are you looking for a one-stop shop to find all your favorite books and videos?
[00:23:03.538 --> 00:23:04.418]  Look no further!
[00:23:04.698 --> 00:23:07.300]  Northern Voice Bookstore has everything you need.
[00:23:07.700 --> 00:23:16.184]  Hundreds of titles, from self-defense, survival, and financial freedom, to history, politics, conspiracy, and everything you need to know about the New World Order.
[00:23:16.364 --> 00:23:17.565]  You can order everything you need
[00:23:17.645 --> 00:23:18.306]  We're good to go.
[00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:34.500]  I think so.
[00:24:01.857 --> 00:24:07.479]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:09.260 --> 00:24:15.802]  I'll play the ABC News clip and go through the reports that are now being denied.
[00:24:15.822 --> 00:24:17.122]  This is just a threat.
[00:24:17.142 --> 00:24:19.143]  They're showing the threat that they're serious.
[00:24:19.823 --> 00:24:24.145]  That they may go ahead and arrest him, indict him, who knows what's going to happen.
[00:24:24.833 --> 00:24:25.954]  The guy's obviously dirty.
[00:24:25.975 --> 00:24:27.376]  We've been getting this on him for years.
[00:24:27.937 --> 00:24:29.478]  That's coming up after I take some calls.
[00:24:30.079 --> 00:24:31.521]  Let's talk to Mike in Illinois.
[00:24:31.541 --> 00:24:32.462]  Mike, you're on the air.
[00:24:32.502 --> 00:24:32.902]  Go ahead.
[00:24:33.283 --> 00:24:34.084]  Hey Alex, how are you?
[00:24:34.284 --> 00:24:34.544]  Good.
[00:24:35.005 --> 00:24:36.647]  I'm looking forward to the Chicago conference.
[00:24:36.667 --> 00:24:42.513]  I got three or four co-workers here that we've all kind of become like-minded individuals and we're all looking forward to meeting you.
[00:24:42.733 --> 00:24:43.094]  How good?
[00:24:44.100 --> 00:24:51.445]  I know it frustrates you when we do this, because we end up preaching to the choir over and over and over again, but shouldn't we stop preaching to the choir and start to mobilize?
[00:24:51.606 --> 00:24:55.108]  We've got 50% of the population screaming for a new investigation on 9-11.
[00:24:55.348 --> 00:24:57.710]  I mean, we've got to break the lazy ignorance.
[00:24:57.770 --> 00:24:59.551]  Nobody wants to read any of these documents.
[00:24:59.591 --> 00:25:00.992]  Nobody wants to do any of this stuff.
[00:25:01.593 --> 00:25:02.773]  How do we break through it?
[00:25:03.194 --> 00:25:04.435]  I know you're doing your best.
[00:25:04.475 --> 00:25:10.359]  You're out there every day banging the street and doing what you can do, and I absolutely admire the heck out of you for doing it.
[00:25:11.648 --> 00:25:13.109]  Isn't it time to start doing something?
[00:25:13.289 --> 00:25:16.232]  We've got 50% of the population screaming for a new investigation.
[00:25:16.872 --> 00:25:22.917]  Sir, you just said that we've got 50% wanting a new investigation and saying the government may be involved.
[00:25:22.937 --> 00:25:24.438]  The new poll stated that.
[00:25:25.238 --> 00:25:29.882]  The point that I'm trying to raise here is that shows that this tactic is winning.
[00:25:30.242 --> 00:25:31.403]  We're having an effect.
[00:25:31.583 --> 00:25:33.364]  And then you say people don't read the documents.
[00:25:33.444 --> 00:25:35.546]  No, people are finding out what happened.
[00:25:37.258 --> 00:25:42.280]  It's probably a blanket statement to say it like that, but a vast majority of the people don't want to wake up.
[00:25:42.780 --> 00:25:46.941]  They want to stay... But wait a minute, that poll shows that a vast majority has woken up.
[00:25:47.141 --> 00:25:57.204]  I understand that, and I'm stepping over myself, but I had the argument on the way in this morning on the train, and they were all talking about American Idol, and I said, did anybody read any of the legislation on immigration?
[00:25:57.524 --> 00:26:00.425]  And I got these blank stares from almost everybody.
[00:26:02.285 --> 00:26:04.186]  And the question was, where do you find that?
[00:26:05.023 --> 00:26:08.726]  And I'm blown away by the fact that they don't even want to listen to it.
[00:26:08.866 --> 00:26:17.993]  I mean, should we not be in the face of the mainstream media and demanding true information, not surface-level arguments that don't have anything to do with the underlying argument?
[00:26:18.013 --> 00:26:24.939]  Well, you've got to know, sir, that the mainstream media is owned by the military-industrial complex, so I wouldn't really expect them to expose themselves.
[00:26:25.379 --> 00:26:30.183]  What we're doing is building our own media, and you guys are helping build it by supporting it.
[00:26:30.763 --> 00:26:33.964]  And we don't need a majority to take back our country.
[00:26:34.084 --> 00:26:41.848]  All we need is a highly motivated minority, and we're already beginning to get a majority that is at least informed and knows that something is wrong.
[00:26:41.888 --> 00:26:43.168]  But, I mean, you want to mobilize?
[00:26:43.208 --> 00:26:43.408]  Sure.
[00:26:43.448 --> 00:26:43.988]  How do we do that?
[00:26:44.028 --> 00:26:45.769]  Tell me.
[00:26:45.789 --> 00:26:46.749]  I don't have the answer.
[00:26:47.110 --> 00:26:47.710]  I really don't.
[00:26:47.850 --> 00:26:51.111]  I'm just, I'm asking because, you know what, I've looked to you for a lot of this stuff.
[00:26:51.151 --> 00:26:52.172]  I've got all your videos.
[00:26:52.632 --> 00:26:54.312]  I've handed them out constantly to people.
[00:26:54.353 --> 00:26:57.914]  I put my job on the line every day having conversations like this every day with people.
[00:26:58.872 --> 00:26:59.853]  Mike, that's the solution.
[00:26:59.873 --> 00:27:00.714]  You're doing it right there.
[00:27:00.754 --> 00:27:01.014]  Listen.
[00:27:01.755 --> 00:27:03.016]  Rome wasn't built in a day.
[00:27:03.096 --> 00:27:04.938]  The New World Order wasn't set up in a day.
[00:27:04.998 --> 00:27:06.539]  We're not going to tear it down in a day.
[00:27:06.699 --> 00:27:07.880]  They're scared right now.
[00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:11.784]  Look at all these reports trying to counter everything we talk about.
[00:27:11.904 --> 00:27:13.085]  They look fearful now.
[00:27:13.145 --> 00:27:15.047]  They're not as arrogant as they once were.
[00:27:15.327 --> 00:27:18.310]  Their whole agenda is moving forward, but it's on fire.
[00:27:19.110 --> 00:27:22.914]  This juggernaut is still rolling forward, but smoke's coming out of every orifice.
[00:27:24.079 --> 00:27:27.222]  I mean, inside their system, alarms are going off.
[00:27:27.302 --> 00:27:34.527]  I mean, picture the New World Order as a giant battleship, and it's going... Engine room!
[00:27:34.567 --> 00:27:34.988]  Engine room!
[00:27:35.008 --> 00:27:35.788]  We're overheating!
[00:27:35.969 --> 00:27:36.489]  We've been hit!
[00:27:36.529 --> 00:27:37.049]  We've been hit!
[00:27:37.089 --> 00:27:38.430]  More enemy fires coming in!
[00:27:38.691 --> 00:27:40.452]  I mean, picture... and then we're sitting here going...
[00:27:40.712 --> 00:27:41.432]  It hasn't sunk.
[00:27:41.492 --> 00:27:42.633]  It hasn't blown up yet.
[00:27:42.853 --> 00:27:44.814]  And I'm saying, just cut the chatter.
[00:27:44.874 --> 00:27:45.994]  Attack, attack, attack.
[00:27:46.294 --> 00:27:52.457]  If you just keep discrediting them, keep exposing them, keep doing what you're doing, it's going to happen.
[00:27:52.497 --> 00:27:53.998]  Because they're going to ram us.
[00:27:54.338 --> 00:27:55.878]  The ramming is about to happen.
[00:27:55.898 --> 00:27:57.239]  They're going to carry out another event.
[00:27:57.499 --> 00:27:59.380]  And at that point, they're going to try martial law.
[00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:01.101]  And I'm telling you, they're going to fail.
[00:28:01.181 --> 00:28:02.061]  They're going to fail.
[00:28:02.581 --> 00:28:13.691]  Well, like I said before, every time I've called in, I'll stand next to you the entire time that they try that, but I hope to God that we still have enough time left, because I'll tell you what, when fear takes hold, all bets are off.
[00:28:13.751 --> 00:28:15.753]  Even people that will stand next to you now will turn on you.
[00:28:16.434 --> 00:28:17.255]  Turn on me?
[00:28:17.315 --> 00:28:19.477]  I mean, listen... I've got to protect my kids, Alex.
[00:28:19.737 --> 00:28:23.100]  Hey, I know what you're saying and I agree with it, but I've got to protect my kids will be the response.
[00:28:23.962 --> 00:28:25.743]  And I just, I hope to God we don't run into that.
[00:28:25.903 --> 00:28:26.984]  Well, I appreciate your call.
[00:28:27.344 --> 00:28:29.806]  You know, we're an instant gratification society.
[00:28:29.846 --> 00:28:35.049]  We expect the hamburger within two minutes out of the Draper window and we're sitting there tapping our foot the whole time.
[00:28:35.389 --> 00:28:46.556]  Hollywood has sold us on this hero image of this hero is going, there's one thing we do and we go and we take over one building, we go to arrest one person and it's all over.
[00:28:46.696 --> 00:28:46.877]  No.
[00:28:47.537 --> 00:28:50.619]  Again, I said this yesterday, you could take over the federal government today.
[00:28:51.730 --> 00:28:56.634]  And we're such a corrupt society that the very people that took it over would try to become dictators themselves.
[00:28:57.315 --> 00:28:59.396]  We have to change our hearts first.
[00:28:59.837 --> 00:29:02.099]  We have to get involved in our local communities first.
[00:29:02.699 --> 00:29:09.065]  We have to go out into the churches and the schools and educate people and re-educate folks.
[00:29:09.085 --> 00:29:10.566]  This has been a long process.
[00:29:11.046 --> 00:29:13.148]  We are a corrupt, decadent society.
[00:29:14.668 --> 00:29:22.914]  Human societies are like petri dishes, and when they get all toxic and rotten and pus-filled, the bacteria grow.
[00:29:25.836 --> 00:29:31.460]  This stuff couldn't happen in the past to this extent in America, because we were more individualistic.
[00:29:31.901 --> 00:29:33.001]  We didn't trust the government.
[00:29:33.041 --> 00:29:34.983]  We knew a big government was bad.
[00:29:36.164 --> 00:29:37.505]  So it's a process, sir.
[00:29:39.887 --> 00:29:40.868]  You know, mobilize!
[00:29:40.928 --> 00:29:42.108]  We are mobilized, sir!
[00:29:42.168 --> 00:29:44.729]  We're manning the guns in the Info War.
[00:29:45.190 --> 00:29:47.691]  The government says 90% of their tactics are Info War.
[00:29:48.071 --> 00:29:48.811]  So are ours.
[00:29:49.231 --> 00:29:49.892]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:52.133 --> 00:29:53.053]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.513 --> 00:29:55.154]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:56.055 --> 00:29:58.756]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.758 --> 00:30:05.801]  People who use Cartabite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[00:30:06.021 --> 00:30:09.423]  For over five years, Cartabite has proven itself time-tested.
[00:30:09.604 --> 00:30:13.026]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cartabite.
[00:30:13.334 --> 00:30:16.595]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[00:30:16.615 --> 00:30:22.078]  The basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the diseases that we've seen.
[00:30:22.098 --> 00:30:31.722]  When we do our program, you know, in herbal formulas like cardivite and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill now going for regular jobs a few months later, we know we're doing something right.
[00:30:31.862 --> 00:30:33.143]  It's a well thought out formula.
[00:30:33.183 --> 00:30:38.645]  I mean, the idea of it working on yeast and metals both at the same time and liver function is dead on.
[00:30:39.145 --> 00:30:43.589]  You'll find I think that it'll work more than just on heart problems and circulation problems.
[00:30:43.669 --> 00:30:45.030]  It'll work on other problems as well.
[00:30:45.190 --> 00:30:49.594]  For more information call 1-877-928-8822 or visit our website at www.heartdrop.com.
[00:30:49.754 --> 00:30:51.176]  That toll free number again 1-877-928-8822.
[00:31:02.077 --> 00:31:05.659]  Do you know where the 78 potentially active volcanoes in the U.S.
[00:31:05.699 --> 00:31:06.200]  are located?
[00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:09.782]  And do you know the locations of the top 300 prime terrorist targets?
[00:31:10.022 --> 00:31:14.725]  You can find these answers and more in the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA.
[00:31:15.005 --> 00:31:20.008]  With the more than 50 interactive parameters, you can pinpoint natural and man-made disaster areas.
[00:31:20.208 --> 00:31:20.849]  We're good to go.
[00:31:40.405 --> 00:31:40.745]  I think so.
[00:32:01.391 --> 00:32:05.834]  If you think your engine is safe by having the oil changed every 3,000 miles, think again.
[00:32:06.114 --> 00:32:09.696]  Every time you start your car, your engine creates friction between the moving parts.
[00:32:09.856 --> 00:32:17.981]  These moving parts wear against each other, and the result is small metal particles circulating through your oil, causing premature wear and damage to your engine.
[00:32:18.241 --> 00:32:23.865]  Oil filters do a good job of trapping the large metal particles, but they will not trap the most harmful tiny particles.
[00:32:24.165 --> 00:32:29.408]  These tiny particles circulate constantly through your oil, and over time your engine begins to show signs of wear.
[00:32:29.668 --> 00:32:31.750]  This is why you need the Filter Mag.
[00:32:32.010 --> 00:32:44.177]  The Filter Mag is a powerful magnet that holds itself to the outside of your oil filter, trapping the tiny metal particles to the inside wall of the filter, extending the life of your oil and ultimately extending the life of your engine.
[00:32:44.397 --> 00:32:48.821]  The reusable FilterMag is maintenance-free, installs in two seconds, and lasts forever.
[00:32:49.041 --> 00:32:50.002]  So what are you waiting for?
[00:32:50.182 --> 00:32:51.803]  Go to FilterMag.com.
[00:32:51.923 --> 00:32:53.705]  That's FilterMag.com.
[00:32:53.965 --> 00:32:54.445]  Or call 800-345-8376.
[00:32:54.485 --> 00:32:54.666]  That's 800-345-8376.
[00:33:16.158 --> 00:33:17.679]  Everybody wants to take action.
[00:33:17.799 --> 00:33:19.320]  Everybody wants to do something.
[00:33:20.380 --> 00:33:22.381]  The world is a pretty big place.
[00:33:22.421 --> 00:33:24.022]  There's six and a half billion people.
[00:33:25.043 --> 00:33:25.663]  Pick an issue.
[00:33:26.503 --> 00:33:33.607]  Expose the phony environmental groups as oil company shills there to sell the American people on a loss of property rights.
[00:33:33.727 --> 00:33:35.728]  Oh, it's for the earth we're taking your land.
[00:33:37.809 --> 00:33:39.030]  Fight for the Second Amendment.
[00:33:39.070 --> 00:33:40.670]  That is absolutely key.
[00:33:41.751 --> 00:33:45.613]  Expose abortion and let people know about the alternatives.
[00:33:46.932 --> 00:33:48.093]  There are so many issues.
[00:33:48.153 --> 00:33:49.294]  Defend the borders.
[00:33:49.434 --> 00:33:50.475]  Join the Minutemen.
[00:33:51.455 --> 00:33:52.536]  Run for office.
[00:33:53.597 --> 00:33:58.181]  Expose the fact that these illegal aliens get more welfare than American citizens.
[00:33:58.961 --> 00:34:06.527]  Expose the United Nations agenda and Agenda 21 and the toll roads and how they're taking over our entire infrastructure.
[00:34:07.819 --> 00:34:22.425]  There are so many things, and then you pick an issue, you go out, you educate others, you don't constantly tell yourself, oh, it's so big, oh, there's nothing I can do, oh, we've got to get somebody to save us, we've got to get somebody to mobilize in some big frontal assault.
[00:34:24.146 --> 00:34:25.307]  I mean, look at what the Feds did.
[00:34:25.367 --> 00:34:30.329]  For three months, they paid and staged the illegal alien protest.
[00:34:30.965 --> 00:34:32.426]  And it blew up in their face.
[00:34:32.526 --> 00:34:33.327]  Rob Allen and Co.
[00:34:33.367 --> 00:34:37.210]  thought that it would cause the American people to accept amnesty, accept open borders.
[00:34:37.270 --> 00:34:42.213]  And they've certainly paid off the Congress and blackmailed them, these shadowy New World Order groups.
[00:34:42.253 --> 00:34:47.077]  And they've got the Senate last week passing a law for Social Security for illegal aliens.
[00:34:47.437 --> 00:34:51.520]  Bush is saying he wants illegal aliens to even get our Social Security when they live in Mexico.
[00:34:52.220 --> 00:34:58.725]  And now the Senate has got the law for guest worker, which is total amnesty, going back and forth between the two countries.
[00:35:00.592 --> 00:35:04.534]  And it's going to the House very soon, and that fight is ongoing.
[00:35:05.475 --> 00:35:06.716]  Listen, take your city.
[00:35:06.756 --> 00:35:13.299]  There are 800 plus, 860 something amnesty or sanctuary cities as they're called.
[00:35:13.880 --> 00:35:15.360]  Make it a big issue in your town.
[00:35:15.621 --> 00:35:16.641]  Run for city council.
[00:35:17.842 --> 00:35:19.443]  Fight the electronic voting machines.
[00:35:19.503 --> 00:35:23.005]  Demand a paper ballot petition recall.
[00:35:24.449 --> 00:35:25.850]  Of the voting machines.
[00:35:25.890 --> 00:35:27.011]  That's how you remove them.
[00:35:27.571 --> 00:35:29.012]  It's been happening in a lot of cities.
[00:35:29.072 --> 00:35:29.992]  Good stuff's happening.
[00:35:30.452 --> 00:35:32.654]  And it happens where people just take action.
[00:35:32.674 --> 00:35:35.875]  You know, I've been to so many political meetings over the years.
[00:35:35.895 --> 00:35:36.976]  I've been to so many events.
[00:35:37.296 --> 00:35:39.517]  And you'll have this new person, and I'm not saying that's you, caller.
[00:35:39.557 --> 00:35:41.558]  I'm talking about people I know in Austin.
[00:35:41.938 --> 00:35:44.560]  And they show up at events and they say, Alex, you need to do this, this, and that.
[00:35:44.860 --> 00:35:45.820]  We're in trouble, Alex!
[00:35:45.840 --> 00:35:46.861]  You need to do this now!
[00:35:46.881 --> 00:35:49.902]  And they'll start telling other people, you know, you need to do this, you need to do that.
[00:35:49.922 --> 00:35:51.383]  We need a plan, a big plan.
[00:35:51.403 --> 00:35:52.624]  We need to do it now!
[00:35:53.474 --> 00:35:56.700]  And that isn't how it works, folks.
[00:35:57.498 --> 00:36:01.239]  I mean, we've had them on the verge of passing draconian gun control legislation here.
[00:36:01.539 --> 00:36:08.941]  And we rally thousands of people, and we have big rallies, and we go in and testify in the committee hearings, and then boom!
[00:36:09.381 --> 00:36:13.202]  We catch bribery in the hallway, and that brings down the chairman of the committee.
[00:36:13.622 --> 00:36:19.443]  He loses his chairmanship, people get in trouble, and the legislation is defeated.
[00:36:19.743 --> 00:36:21.223]  You know, God is on our side.
[00:36:21.283 --> 00:36:22.704]  Good little things like that happen.
[00:36:23.044 --> 00:36:24.084]  We catch it on tape.
[00:36:25.605 --> 00:36:27.386]  But again, we need bodies there.
[00:36:27.426 --> 00:36:28.327]  We need people there.
[00:36:28.747 --> 00:36:36.452]  I mean, if you just go out and try to do good, if you just go out and know your facts, if you just go out and pick a few issues, you're going to be able to have an effect.
[00:36:37.372 --> 00:36:38.553]  But it's a big world.
[00:36:38.613 --> 00:36:39.754]  It's a complex world.
[00:36:39.794 --> 00:36:41.855]  You've got to first get informed.
[00:36:42.155 --> 00:36:43.076]  Really informed.
[00:36:43.636 --> 00:36:45.137]  And then you've got to get confident.
[00:36:46.358 --> 00:36:48.679]  Because I know a lot of people, it's all psychological.
[00:36:48.719 --> 00:36:52.121]  If you're hesitant when you tell somebody about the New World Order, they won't respect you.
[00:36:52.799 --> 00:36:54.921]  A lot of people say, Alex, you've got to be slow with them.
[00:36:54.941 --> 00:36:56.122]  You've got to slowly introduce them.
[00:36:56.522 --> 00:36:56.722]  No.
[00:36:56.782 --> 00:37:02.627]  If somebody's house is on fire and they're sucking their thumbs in bed going, no, it's not a fire.
[00:37:02.667 --> 00:37:03.968]  I'm not going to get out of my bed.
[00:37:04.429 --> 00:37:05.410]  You do what the firemen do.
[00:37:05.430 --> 00:37:06.811]  You just grab them and drag them out.
[00:37:07.685 --> 00:37:12.267]  And I'm just like, hey, human history is one tyrant after another abusing populations.
[00:37:12.687 --> 00:37:14.048]  America's going down the tubes.
[00:37:14.088 --> 00:37:15.268]  Here's all the evidence of it.
[00:37:15.508 --> 00:37:17.189]  Now you listen to me and you listen good.
[00:37:17.249 --> 00:37:21.231]  You get up, off your hind end, you get educated and you join us in this fight.
[00:37:21.431 --> 00:37:22.131]  Comprende?
[00:37:22.331 --> 00:37:23.091]  Do you got it?
[00:37:23.632 --> 00:37:25.352]  And most people go, yes, I've got it.
[00:37:25.452 --> 00:37:25.873]  Good!
[00:37:26.153 --> 00:37:28.414]  Now get in gear right now!
[00:37:29.734 --> 00:37:30.795]  We've got to be confident.
[00:37:30.815 --> 00:37:31.755]  We've got to be focused.
[00:37:31.775 --> 00:37:32.756]  We've got to be serious.
[00:37:33.016 --> 00:37:33.716]  This is a war.
[00:37:36.306 --> 00:37:41.208]  And all of us can pick a target, any target, in this fight and start the information war.
[00:37:41.308 --> 00:37:42.909]  I don't care if it's a neighborhood newsletter.
[00:37:43.609 --> 00:37:45.550]  I don't care if it's your own local website.
[00:37:46.090 --> 00:37:51.032]  I don't care if it's your own local access TV show or if you buy radio time on a local station.
[00:37:51.052 --> 00:37:52.193]  A lot of you are business owners.
[00:37:52.233 --> 00:37:52.833]  You've got money.
[00:37:53.293 --> 00:38:00.777]  Go start a local, buy two hours every Saturday or Sunday night on a local talk station and don't expect big results the first month.
[00:38:00.877 --> 00:38:01.637]  Do it for a year.
[00:38:02.435 --> 00:38:03.976]  And sponsor it with your own business.
[00:38:03.996 --> 00:38:05.016]  You'll end up paying for it.
[00:38:05.376 --> 00:38:06.576]  Get a few other sponsors.
[00:38:07.077 --> 00:38:09.897]  Your show might be good enough, they might give you a weekday show and pay you.
[00:38:09.917 --> 00:38:17.940]  I know so many people, they go and they try something once or twice and they don't get a big bonanza of results out of it, so they quit.
[00:38:18.931 --> 00:38:20.213]  That's not how you do things.
[00:38:20.693 --> 00:38:21.935]  You just keep hammering.
[00:38:21.955 --> 00:38:22.876]  You keep driving.
[00:38:22.916 --> 00:38:23.797]  You keep pushing.
[00:38:24.097 --> 00:38:25.159]  You never stop.
[00:38:25.639 --> 00:38:26.721]  You never back down.
[00:38:26.761 --> 00:38:28.463]  I mean, take Dylan Avery.
[00:38:28.483 --> 00:38:30.805]  21 years old when he started his first loose change.
[00:38:31.106 --> 00:38:32.187]  Loose change second edition.
[00:38:32.207 --> 00:38:32.988]  He's 22, about to be 23.
[00:38:34.477 --> 00:38:37.260]  And what is it, like 15 million Google downloads now?
[00:38:38.921 --> 00:38:42.324]  We personally have sold about a thousand copies here.
[00:38:44.206 --> 00:38:45.647]  People are making copies of it everywhere.
[00:38:45.667 --> 00:38:51.072]  There have been millions of downloads of Martial Law online, my 9-11 film.
[00:38:51.112 --> 00:38:58.358]  There have been people making millions of copies out there, getting the originals, and if you do the math, making a dozen or so copies apiece, it turns into...
[00:39:00.015 --> 00:39:02.016]  And there are a lot of you who understand this.
[00:39:02.097 --> 00:39:03.497]  You're going to prosecute the war.
[00:39:03.758 --> 00:39:04.898]  You're going to take action.
[00:39:05.179 --> 00:39:06.640]  You're not going to listen to the propaganda.
[00:39:06.660 --> 00:39:07.820]  You're going to keep moving forward.
[00:39:08.921 --> 00:39:21.830]  And if the New World Order wants to try to put troops in the streets and nuke a city and run around and try to train us how to be slaves, they want to get down to the brass tacks, they've got to know we're going to fight them in every way when that happens.
[00:39:21.950 --> 00:39:22.550]  And you know what?
[00:39:22.650 --> 00:39:23.771]  They'll test the water.
[00:39:24.051 --> 00:39:27.934]  They'll stick their toe in and figure out it's boiling and they're not going to jump in.
[00:39:28.968 --> 00:39:31.469]  I want the New World Order to know there's a lot of us who aren't afraid.
[00:39:31.489 --> 00:39:36.111]  I want the government to know there's a lot of us who don't rationalize and make excuses like you do.
[00:39:36.391 --> 00:39:37.751]  I'm talking to the minions out there.
[00:39:37.791 --> 00:39:39.352]  You know good and well this stuff's going on.
[00:39:40.032 --> 00:39:42.953]  You work for a government that runs giant child kidnapping rings.
[00:39:43.233 --> 00:39:48.035]  A government that dumps solid nerve gas by the millions of gallons right in the Atlantic Ocean off our coast.
[00:39:48.295 --> 00:39:52.057]  You work for a government that nerve gases our own troops just to test it on them and kills them.
[00:39:52.437 --> 00:39:55.238]  You work for a government that puts cancer viruses in the vaccines.
[00:39:55.518 --> 00:39:58.879]  You work for a government that sterilized 400 and something thousand women in this country.
[00:39:59.119 --> 00:40:02.440]  You work for a government that gave black men syphilis for 40 years and let them spread it.
[00:40:02.760 --> 00:40:06.301]  You work for a government that funded the Nazis and then protected them after the war.
[00:40:06.621 --> 00:40:11.482]  You work for a government that is engaged in terrorist attacks worldwide to blame it on their enemies, declassified.
[00:40:11.722 --> 00:40:14.163]  You work for a government that ships in heroin and cocaine.
[00:40:14.423 --> 00:40:17.423]  You work for a government that runs most of the prostitution.
[00:40:17.663 --> 00:40:19.704]  You work for a government that's a bunch of mobsters.
[00:40:20.024 --> 00:40:30.427]  And they've gotten greedy, and they've gotten out of control, and they're spreading like a cancer, and they're so stupid their host is even sick, so some of the elite's getting scared right now and trying to put the brakes on it.
[00:40:33.227 --> 00:40:36.108]  Oh yeah, oh yeah, there's all sorts of stuff going on right now.
[00:40:36.208 --> 00:40:37.088]  We're in trouble.
[00:40:37.408 --> 00:40:42.970]  These people have gotten so greedy and so decadent that this thing... America's like a giant spaceship.
[00:40:43.510 --> 00:40:46.091]  And basically there's no one even piloting it right now.
[00:40:46.111 --> 00:40:47.511]  We're going towards the sun here.
[00:40:49.978 --> 00:40:53.761]  Now, I said I'd take a lot of your calls, but that caller brought that up and she got me off on a jag.
[00:40:54.362 --> 00:41:01.488]  Let me just briefly play this ABC News clip, comment on it about Hastert, give you some of the corruption news, and then we'll just start taking calls continually.
[00:41:01.528 --> 00:41:02.869]  Everybody stay there, we're going to get to you.
[00:41:03.229 --> 00:41:06.772]  Carlos and Jason and Tim and Stan and Ron and others.
[00:41:07.973 --> 00:41:11.356]  Right now, let's go ahead and play the ABC clip.
[00:41:11.838 --> 00:41:12.379]  Good evening.
[00:41:12.499 --> 00:41:16.222]  We begin with a major development in a Washington bribery scandal.
[00:41:16.422 --> 00:41:26.031]  Tonight, sources tell ABC News the case involving convicted lobbyist Jack Abramoff has led FBI investigators to some of the most powerful members of Congress.
[00:41:26.531 --> 00:41:30.675]  Namely, the man second in line for the presidency after the vice president.
[00:41:31.255 --> 00:41:38.516]  This is a story with potentially major political implications, and our Chief Investigative Correspondent, Brian Ross, joins us with his exclusive report.
[00:41:38.576 --> 00:41:38.956]  Brian?
[00:41:39.196 --> 00:41:49.958]  Elizabeth, federal officials tell us the Congressional bribery investigation now includes the Speaker of the House, Dennis Hastert, based on information from the convicted lobbyists who are cooperating with the government.
[00:41:50.699 --> 00:41:58.660]  Justice Department officials describe the 64-year-old Illinois Republican as very much in the mix of the corruption investigation.
[00:41:59.870 --> 00:42:10.800]  Part of the investigation is said to involve a letter Hassert wrote three years ago, urging the Secretary of the Interior to block a casino on an Indian reservation that would have competed with other tribes.
[00:42:11.301 --> 00:42:20.509]  The other tribes were represented by convicted lobbyist Jack Abramoff, who reportedly has provided details of his dealings with Hassert as part of his plea agreement with the government.
[00:42:21.090 --> 00:42:25.474]  The letter was written shortly after a fundraiser for Hassert at a restaurant owned by Abramoff.
[00:42:26.025 --> 00:42:30.351]  Abramoff and his clients contributed more than $26,000 at the time.
[00:42:30.892 --> 00:42:40.745]  The day Abramoff was indicted, Hassert denied any unlawful connection and said he would donate to charity any campaign contributions he had received from Abramoff or his clients.
[00:42:41.599 --> 00:42:52.305]  This week, following the FBI raid on the office of another congressman under investigation, Democrat William Jefferson of Louisiana, Hassett was outspoken in his criticism of the FBI.
[00:42:52.525 --> 00:42:59.749]  We are not trying to protect any individual, but we want to protect the privacy of the House as far as the Constitution.
[00:43:01.306 --> 00:43:09.228]  A spokesman for Hassard said the Speaker was unaware he was the subject of any FBI investigation and that there had been no requests or subpoenas for documents.
[00:43:09.728 --> 00:43:14.269]  The spokesman said Hassard had a long history of opposing certain types of Indian concedos.
[00:43:14.729 --> 00:43:17.510]  And Elizabeth, this is an investigation clearly at the very beginning.
[00:43:17.870 --> 00:43:19.910]  The allegations could well prove unfounded.
[00:43:20.210 --> 00:43:24.151]  But what's clear from all this is that the FBI intends to take this case wherever it goes.
[00:43:25.812 --> 00:43:27.813]  Oh yes, the FBI, they're going to save us.
[00:43:27.933 --> 00:43:33.597]  And we're made to believe that Abramoff is the biggest, baddest lobbyist out there.
[00:43:33.777 --> 00:43:41.982]  No, they chose Abramoff because it wasn't missile secrets, it wasn't supercomputers, it wasn't chemical waste, it wasn't child kidnapping rings.
[00:43:42.682 --> 00:43:45.104]  No, it was Indians and casinos.
[00:43:46.064 --> 00:43:46.925]  And so they could do that.
[00:43:47.525 --> 00:43:51.768]  And notice you don't hear much about Duke Cunningham, pled guilty, stole over 800 million dollars.
[00:43:52.728 --> 00:43:55.250]  It was just mailed to fake P.O.
[00:43:55.290 --> 00:44:09.840]  boxes connected directly to the number three at the CIA, and the last director of the CIA, of course, Porter Goss, and these parties where they were playing poker with all the hookers at the Watergate Hotel again, and all the payoffs flowing, and that's why he's resigned.
[00:44:10.220 --> 00:44:19.547]  And no, if you don't hear about that, no, no, you're going to hear about Indians and casinos, and I believe this is Israel, because we know the M.O.
[00:44:19.627 --> 00:44:19.827]  on this.
[00:44:19.847 --> 00:44:21.088]  We've seen this over and over again.
[00:44:21.883 --> 00:44:23.125]  We know Israel, whenever the U.S.
[00:44:23.145 --> 00:44:37.203]  wants to attack somebody or isn't giving them enough foreign aid, that they will bring out some of these lesser corruption issues and basically menace members of Congress that haven't been totally playing ball.
[00:44:38.504 --> 00:44:43.928]  So if I had to put my finger on it, we know the FBI only brings these charges when they're given the green light by the higher-ups.
[00:44:43.948 --> 00:44:50.072]  I mean, I'm sure the FBI agents that are doing this investigation are good guys and think they're doing a wonderful thing and everything's good.
[00:44:50.092 --> 00:44:52.814]  But I've interviewed many of them in the past.
[00:44:52.994 --> 00:44:55.216]  Whenever it's something really important, they're told, back off.
[00:44:55.576 --> 00:44:57.738]  So this is all being allowed for some reason.
[00:44:58.573 --> 00:45:09.264]  And you notice that Bush is surrounding himself with even more Israeli double agents, people who have dual citizenship, like Chertoff and his new Chief of Staff and many, many others.
[00:45:09.364 --> 00:45:10.625]  And Obert is here in the U.S.
[00:45:10.665 --> 00:45:14.910]  shaking his finger at us, the new Israeli Prime Minister, saying, you've got to attack Iran.
[00:45:15.790 --> 00:45:21.314]  It's really sick to read Israeli newspapers where they say we're bad because we haven't attacked Iran for them yet.
[00:45:21.675 --> 00:45:37.946]  And I believe this is all pressure and a large part of this, a large part of this being allowed to surface in the media is Israel trying to squeeze Congress and letting Congress know you do exactly what we say, we don't care how unpopular it is with your constituents, you're going to do this or else.
[00:45:37.986 --> 00:45:40.468]  And this is how things are played.
[00:45:41.148 --> 00:45:44.991]  They bribe you to a certain degree and then they use that against you later.
[00:45:46.311 --> 00:45:53.997]  Let me hit a few other corruption items for you and then we'll go directly to your calls.
[00:45:54.277 --> 00:45:56.539]  Cheney might testify in the Liberty case.
[00:45:56.639 --> 00:45:56.879]  L.A.
[00:45:56.939 --> 00:46:03.284]  Times Vice President Dick Cheney may be called as a government witness in the perjury and obstruction case against the former Chief of Staff.
[00:46:04.416 --> 00:46:25.430]  Lewis Scooter Libby, a Special Prosecutor, indicated yesterday that again he may not in a court file impacted J. Fitzgerald held open the possibility that during Libby's trial set for January he might ask Cheney to authenticate the handwritten notations in the margins of the July 2003 newspaper column critical of the Bush administration's decision to go to war with Iraq.
[00:46:26.411 --> 00:46:27.832]  And so we have the
[00:46:30.495 --> 00:46:32.580]  Fitzgerald is obviously a globalist tool, folks.
[00:46:32.620 --> 00:46:35.346]  If you don't know that, you need to wake up.
[00:46:38.331 --> 00:46:48.197]  Oh, notice as soon as Hassard comes out, too, running scared and says, hey, the White House isn't allowed to send its executive branch over here to seize documents inside the Congress.
[00:46:48.217 --> 00:46:49.918]  You know, we're a reservation.
[00:46:49.938 --> 00:46:51.019]  This is sanctuary.
[00:46:51.059 --> 00:46:53.080]  We can't come to the White House and grab your documents.
[00:46:53.500 --> 00:46:56.782]  And then suddenly the FBI comes out and says he's a person of interest.
[00:46:57.323 --> 00:47:03.967]  Now they're coming out and trying to back away from that just a little bit.
[00:47:04.487 --> 00:47:07.789]  Ken Lay has been convicted on seven counts.
[00:47:08.976 --> 00:47:17.352]  Ken Lay, the Enron Chief, has been convicted on seven counts, excuse me, six counts, and one report says seven, we're not sure.
[00:47:17.673 --> 00:47:20.518]  This is out of the Associated Press two minutes ago, so this is just out.
[00:47:21.830 --> 00:47:30.697]  Enron Corporation founder Kenneth Lay has been convicted of all six counts against him, including conspiracy to commit securities fraud and wire fraud.
[00:47:31.198 --> 00:47:32.179]  Conspiracy?
[00:47:32.579 --> 00:47:33.440]  That's impossible.
[00:47:33.480 --> 00:47:35.521]  There's never been a conspiracy in humankind.
[00:47:35.902 --> 00:47:39.745]  The media tells us there's no government conspiracies or no corporate conspiracies.
[00:47:39.785 --> 00:47:45.850]  I mean, two people never get together and decide to do something illegal or corrupt or disingenuous.
[00:47:46.951 --> 00:47:49.593]  I mean, that just doesn't exist.
[00:47:51.687 --> 00:48:02.096]  Oh no, there's not conspiracies out there where charlatans get together and decide to, you know, get on radio and pitch products that they claim will heal any disease you have.
[00:48:02.436 --> 00:48:03.657]  That's a conspiracy right there.
[00:48:03.977 --> 00:48:05.538]  Those people know exactly what they're doing.
[00:48:06.619 --> 00:48:16.487]  And there's conspiracies where the car lot manager and the car lot salesman decide to push women around or people they think are stupid around and rip you off on a car.
[00:48:17.468 --> 00:48:18.409]  That's a conspiracy.
[00:48:19.133 --> 00:48:21.715]  When two guys get together and decide to rob a bank, that's a conspiracy.
[00:48:21.995 --> 00:48:24.977]  But again, the media says it's impossible, so that can't happen.
[00:48:25.297 --> 00:48:26.317]  We'll take some calls later.
[00:48:26.338 --> 00:48:27.578]  I'll get more into all this corruption.
[00:48:28.159 --> 00:48:29.439]  But again, what's behind this?
[00:48:30.120 --> 00:48:32.461]  Carlos, in California.
[00:48:32.501 --> 00:48:33.122]  Thanks for holding.
[00:48:33.162 --> 00:48:33.462]  Welcome.
[00:48:34.302 --> 00:48:34.843]  Hey, Alex.
[00:48:35.063 --> 00:48:39.225]  I'm looking forward to seeing you next month here in Los Angeles, in June.
[00:48:39.566 --> 00:48:40.626]  Oh, you're going to come, Carlos.
[00:48:40.666 --> 00:48:41.527]  I can't wait to meet you.
[00:48:42.047 --> 00:48:43.068]  I'll be there, my friend.
[00:48:43.688 --> 00:48:45.069]  Okay, I can't wait to see you, too.
[00:48:45.209 --> 00:48:46.230]  Have you gotten your tickets yet?
[00:48:46.869 --> 00:48:47.630]  I've got my ticket.
[00:48:47.830 --> 00:48:48.170]  I'm there.
[00:48:48.370 --> 00:48:49.471]  Fantastic.
[00:48:49.671 --> 00:48:50.752]  I can't wait to shake your hand.
[00:48:51.553 --> 00:48:52.033]  You got it.
[00:48:52.954 --> 00:48:57.777]  Listen, you're so right about this CIA influence.
[00:48:57.857 --> 00:48:59.639]  It's so pervasive.
[00:48:59.699 --> 00:49:09.026]  If you look around the world, they instigate just about every destabilization effort in Africa, Latin America, Asia.
[00:49:09.046 --> 00:49:10.327]  They're behind the gun running.
[00:49:11.408 --> 00:49:13.649]  And then they brag about it a decade after they do it.
[00:49:15.071 --> 00:49:15.491]  Exactly.
[00:49:16.061 --> 00:49:24.746]  And then they use banks to finance all their activities, and some of the most prestigious families in the world are involved in some of these banks.
[00:49:25.607 --> 00:49:29.009]  And, you know, they've taken a hold of radio stations.
[00:49:29.089 --> 00:49:39.035]  I'm convinced that here in America there are several radio stations where, opposing different viewpoints, a left and a right, where the journalists there, or the commentators, are CIA agents.
[00:49:39.744 --> 00:49:41.285]  I mean, these people are all over the place.
[00:49:41.305 --> 00:49:42.706]  You look at Latin America.
[00:49:42.847 --> 00:49:46.970]  You look at President Fox, who came from Coca-Cola, came from Harvard University.
[00:49:47.390 --> 00:49:51.754]  You look at his predecessors, Cedillo, Salinas de Gortari.
[00:49:52.114 --> 00:49:54.216]  You look at President Saca from El Salvador.
[00:49:54.576 --> 00:49:57.899]  You look at Calderón, who's running for office in Mexico.
[00:49:57.959 --> 00:50:03.684]  All these people come from Yale, Harvard, which are grooming grounds for intelligence activities.
[00:50:03.804 --> 00:50:05.225]  Oh, that's it, sir.
[00:50:05.365 --> 00:50:06.546]  You're absolutely right, Carlos.
[00:50:06.566 --> 00:50:07.447]  This is exactly
[00:50:08.081 --> 00:50:09.062]  What's going on?
[00:50:09.302 --> 00:50:21.649]  And Fox, his presidential campaign and his gubernatorial before that were run out of Rob Allen and Co., the PR firm that Rogue's involved with, and so was both of Bush's gubernatorial and both presidential.
[00:50:22.009 --> 00:50:24.190]  I mean, these guys are nothing but frontmen.
[00:50:25.371 --> 00:50:28.292]  Yes, they go out there in destabilized countries.
[00:50:28.492 --> 00:50:31.074]  In some cases, they'll be leftists like Chavez.
[00:50:31.633 --> 00:50:32.773]  Stay there Carlos.
[00:50:32.793 --> 00:50:34.954]  I want to hear more about what you think about Chavez.
[00:50:34.974 --> 00:50:36.454]  I'm curious to hear your view on that.
[00:50:36.534 --> 00:50:37.834]  I respect your view.
[00:50:37.874 --> 00:50:40.095]  Your calls have always been very informative.
[00:50:40.115 --> 00:50:40.315]  Stay there.
[00:50:40.335 --> 00:50:42.955]  We'll come back to you and we'll go to many others.
[00:50:43.175 --> 00:50:43.875]  Stay with us.
[00:51:03.030 --> 00:51:05.872]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[00:51:06.132 --> 00:51:07.713]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.

[00:51:22.321 --> 00:51:25.161]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[00:51:25.261 --> 00:51:29.923]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[00:51:30.123 --> 00:51:34.524]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[00:51:34.764 --> 00:51:41.986]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.

[00:53:57.428 --> 00:54:10.138]  Alright, let's go back to Carlos.
[00:54:16.770 --> 00:54:19.031]  Carlos, continue with your statement.
[00:54:19.911 --> 00:54:22.473]  Well, you questioned Chavez.
[00:54:22.533 --> 00:54:25.294]  Now, Chavez is a little bit of an ambiguity.
[00:54:25.314 --> 00:54:34.479]  He's being portrayed by the world press as a populist, as a liberator, as a patriot for Venezuela, who there stands up to the oil companies.
[00:54:35.080 --> 00:54:37.921]  Okay, but that may be a facade, a front.
[00:54:38.381 --> 00:54:41.103]  Now, what they don't tell you is that Hugo Chavez
[00:54:42.011 --> 00:55:06.892]  The President of Brazil, Lula, the President of Colombia, Uribe, about two or three years ago, in consecutive months, visited the offices of the Council of Foreign Relations on Pratt Street in New York City, and apparently they met with the international bankers there, and apparently came to some agreements as to getting further international monetary loans and further World Bank loans.
[00:55:07.512 --> 00:55:08.533]  So what does that tell you?
[00:55:09.114 --> 00:55:10.455]  The man has sold out.
[00:55:10.984 --> 00:55:12.585]  To the international bankers.
[00:55:13.426 --> 00:55:24.095]  My opinion is he's an agent provocateur who's there to destabilize, create conflict, and provoke, probably, our entrance down the stretch into Latin America.
[00:55:24.896 --> 00:55:25.917]  Military entrance?
[00:55:26.077 --> 00:55:27.478]  We're already there.
[00:55:27.558 --> 00:55:35.925]  Well, regardless, that's what's happening now, and that's the movement we see is towards a massive conflict down there.
[00:55:36.866 --> 00:55:37.707]  Well, you know what?
[00:55:38.613 --> 00:55:48.461]  Eleven countries, all the leftist countries, five or six of them, including Mexico, of course, is going to join the ranks as soon as Lopez Obrador, the leftist, becomes president.
[00:55:49.081 --> 00:55:57.048]  They apparently have been having meetings with the Arab nations, Iran and so on, and have formed some kind of a pact.
[00:55:57.108 --> 00:55:58.969]  The Russians and the Chinese are all moving in.
[00:55:59.009 --> 00:56:01.171]  Notice our government gave them the Panama Canal.
[00:56:02.208 --> 00:56:03.849]  I mean, this is part of a bigger picture.
[00:56:04.329 --> 00:56:05.850]  Carlos, I agree with you.
[00:56:06.811 --> 00:56:07.811]  It's all very suspicious.
[00:56:09.012 --> 00:56:24.900]  So when we attack Iran, who by the way I think Iran's man there is also a CIA asset provocateur, we attack them, eventually down the stretch we're going to have to go into military confrontations with all these leftist countries in Latin America.
[00:56:25.595 --> 00:56:26.476]  I agree with you.
[00:56:45.362 --> 00:56:46.863]  The rest of the dominoes will go through.
[00:56:47.243 --> 00:56:47.763]  I agree with you.
[00:56:47.803 --> 00:56:48.463]  Thanks for the call.
[00:56:48.503 --> 00:56:52.885]  I can't wait to meet you June 24th and 25th in downtown Los Angeles at the Sheraton.
[00:56:52.905 --> 00:56:54.386]  We're going to be having the big 9-11 event.
[00:56:54.426 --> 00:57:01.329]  And I can announce, I am proud and excited to announce, Ray McGovern yesterday confirmed he is coming.
[00:57:01.349 --> 00:57:03.009]  And he's only been to one other 9-11 event.
[00:57:03.410 --> 00:57:04.450]  He's really hard to get.
[00:57:04.650 --> 00:57:06.231]  He doesn't go to the other conferences.
[00:57:07.651 --> 00:57:11.353]  Ray McGovern, a high-level CIA advisor to George Bush.
[00:57:13.434 --> 00:57:15.978]  Senior Ronald Reagan, he goes all the way back to Kennedy.
[00:57:16.479 --> 00:57:20.524]  He is going to be there with a presentation on 9-11 and the neocon agenda.
[00:57:22.307 --> 00:57:27.334]  Dr. Bob Bowman, former head of the Star Wars program, will be there exposing 9-11 as an inside job.
[00:57:27.374 --> 00:57:29.277]  Professor Steven Jones, Professor Jim Fetzer.
[00:57:30.707 --> 00:57:32.688]  Dylan Avery of Loose Change 2 fame.
[00:57:32.828 --> 00:57:35.209]  Of course, we're going to have Webster Griffin Tartley there.
[00:57:35.590 --> 00:57:37.130]  Myself, I'll be giving a speech.
[00:57:37.190 --> 00:57:38.051]  PowerPoint as well.
[00:57:38.551 --> 00:57:39.652]  This is going to be amazing.
[00:57:39.752 --> 00:57:41.633]  Ladies and gentlemen, a bunch of other speakers too.
[00:57:42.113 --> 00:57:44.114]  Two days, 20 hours of conference.
[00:57:45.918 --> 00:57:49.481]  I will of course debut my new film, Terror Storm, at the very start of the conference.
[00:57:49.981 --> 00:57:50.922]  A lot of press conference.
[00:57:50.982 --> 00:57:51.863]  It's going to be amazing.

[00:58:59.338 --> 00:59:00.438]  Mainstream media.

[00:59:02.859 --> 00:59:03.679]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.419 --> 00:59:05.300]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.320 --> 00:59:09.761]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.181 --> 00:59:14.242]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:18.227 --> 00:59:19.988]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:59:20.028 --> 00:59:20.809]  until 2 p.m.
[00:59:20.849 --> 00:59:21.849]  Central Standard Time.
[00:59:21.889 --> 00:59:23.910]  We're here live and back from 9 to midnight.
[00:59:24.010 --> 00:59:26.372]  It is Thursday, 25th day of May, 2006.
[00:59:26.512 --> 00:59:30.754]  I said I'd have wide open phones today.
[00:59:30.774 --> 00:59:33.395]  I got off into Hastert and the big bribery scandal.
[00:59:33.475 --> 00:59:34.276]  It's really breaking.
[00:59:34.676 --> 00:59:36.197]  More details on that coming up.
[00:59:36.217 --> 00:59:46.583]  I believe there's foreign blackmail and internal blackmail going on here with several agendas at play, including Israel trying to force the U.S., which they've been openly spanking us for in public.
[00:59:46.623 --> 00:59:47.283]  It's pretty pathetic.
[00:59:48.952 --> 00:59:52.435]  To go ahead and attack Iran.
[00:59:52.815 --> 00:59:54.337]  Israel manipulating the U.S.
[00:59:54.377 --> 01:00:04.305]  and pushing us around is like a... Hummingbirds will run off hawks or eagles if they roost in a tree that's near where the hummingbirds are staying.
[01:00:05.305 --> 01:00:05.646]  Literally.
[01:00:05.706 --> 01:00:07.908]  I'm not an ornithologist, but I like to read about birds.
[01:00:07.928 --> 01:00:09.169]  I think they're neat.
[01:00:09.209 --> 01:00:11.350]  Just a little bitty hummingbird will run hawks and things off.
[01:00:12.191 --> 01:00:14.473]  Sometimes crows will run off eagles.
[01:00:15.497 --> 01:00:20.319]  But it's kind of like a Chihuahua bossing a Great Dane around.
[01:00:20.339 --> 01:00:28.181]  I was talking to a friend who has a Great Dane and he talks about how his wife Chihuahua bosses it around and is in full command.
[01:00:28.701 --> 01:00:31.362]  That's how it is at my house with the Chihuahua and the Boston Terrier.
[01:00:31.382 --> 01:00:33.303]  The Chihuahua is the supreme ruler.
[01:00:34.403 --> 01:00:36.164]  Let's go ahead and go to the calls.
[01:00:36.284 --> 01:00:37.424]  Jason in Texas.
[01:00:37.904 --> 01:00:38.865]  Jason, you're on the air.
[01:00:38.945 --> 01:00:39.325]  Go ahead.
[01:00:39.345 --> 01:00:41.105]  Hey, thanks for the call.
[01:00:43.683 --> 01:00:47.984]  Get your comments on the speech yesterday from the Prime Minister.
[01:00:48.004 --> 01:00:51.925]  Basically, it was word for word what President Bush said at the UN.
[01:00:52.405 --> 01:00:56.606]  Jargon like, you know, if we don't do anything, then nobody's going to respect us.
[01:00:56.706 --> 01:01:02.908]  And if the world community doesn't go to war, then Israel will go to war.
[01:01:03.624 --> 01:01:05.706]  It's for the safety of the children, and blah blah blah.
[01:01:06.046 --> 01:01:14.593]  Next point I wanted to add... Yeah, they're openly saying they are going to attack Iran, and every time Iran says we'll defend ourselves, it's taken out of context, too.
[01:01:14.693 --> 01:01:16.515]  Iran's written a preemptively strike.
[01:01:17.115 --> 01:01:18.477]  Did you hear the speech yesterday?
[01:01:19.017 --> 01:01:22.440]  I didn't physically hear it, but I did read the transcript.
[01:01:22.460 --> 01:01:24.241]  In fact, let me just tell the network this now.
[01:01:24.602 --> 01:01:27.624]  Go get, just type in Israeli Prime Minister Obert's speech.
[01:01:28.245 --> 01:01:29.166]  It'll be up now.
[01:01:29.706 --> 01:01:31.848]  Grab it, and let's play some clips of that later.
[01:01:32.731 --> 01:01:39.894]  Yes sir, and basically I just watched the rebroadcast on C-SPAN, and I watched the whole thing, and everyone was there.
[01:01:40.014 --> 01:01:41.274]  Chaney was behind them and all that.
[01:01:42.355 --> 01:01:46.116]  Another point, you can talk about this later, but I just wanted to bring this up.
[01:01:46.456 --> 01:01:50.678]  As far as all the immigration stuff and amnesty and all this stuff, here's what's going to happen.
[01:01:51.138 --> 01:01:57.380]  These Mexicans, or illegals, or whatever you want to call them, they're going to start demanding fair wages because they've been validated.
[01:01:57.887 --> 01:02:00.528]  And then you're going to have... Oh, sir, that's already happening!
[01:02:01.089 --> 01:02:06.712]  That's already happening, and then they'll... Those groups will get bigger wages, and they'll bring in more illegals to replace them.
[01:02:07.172 --> 01:02:08.913]  The 25 million will all get amnesty.
[01:02:09.053 --> 01:02:11.054]  In 1986, they said it'd be a million people getting amnesty.
[01:02:11.294 --> 01:02:12.515]  Turned out it was like 7 million.
[01:02:12.775 --> 01:02:14.496]  This time they say it's 14 million.
[01:02:14.836 --> 01:02:17.337]  Well, if it was five times last time, what's it going to be?
[01:02:17.357 --> 01:02:19.838]  Or six times last time, what will it be this time?
[01:02:20.098 --> 01:02:23.220]  And then once you get all those anchor people here, they're the anchor.
[01:02:23.240 --> 01:02:24.561]  They're going to bring in their whole families.
[01:02:25.461 --> 01:02:26.862]  And Alex, it's like, um...
[01:02:27.645 --> 01:02:31.367]  This is just a small cell of the whole New World Order body.
[01:02:31.407 --> 01:02:40.073]  I mean, if you take the microscope and you out of focus and you actually see the whole body of the New World Order... They're overrunning Europe with foreigners.
[01:02:40.493 --> 01:02:43.655]  They're overrunning Asia with whatever countries nearby.
[01:02:43.675 --> 01:02:47.357]  It's all about bringing in foreign groups to destroy the sovereignty of that nation.
[01:02:47.828 --> 01:02:48.668]  Last point, Alex.
[01:02:49.008 --> 01:02:49.848]  Underground cities.
[01:02:49.868 --> 01:02:52.869]  Supposedly there's 300 underground cities.
[01:02:53.009 --> 01:02:57.730]  I mean, if they have underground cities, you know, first of all, if they can't kill us, they're going to control us.
[01:02:57.830 --> 01:02:59.910]  But as we wake up, they're going to just try and kill us.
[01:02:59.970 --> 01:03:03.191]  Are they going to go to these underground cities and survive there or do what they want to do?
[01:03:03.371 --> 01:03:05.031]  Let me comment on that after the break.
[01:03:05.151 --> 01:03:06.511]  That is not a wives' tale.
[01:03:06.551 --> 01:03:07.211]  That is true.
[01:03:09.112 --> 01:03:10.392]  Thank you.
[01:03:10.552 --> 01:03:13.853]  The number you're getting, sir, is there's over 300 underground bunkers.
[01:03:16.855 --> 01:03:28.640]  And some of these could house 50 people, some of the smaller ones, some of the larger can hold, the reports are, over 20,000 people and supply them for upwards of a decade.
[01:03:30.121 --> 01:03:37.064]  And this is a key point, this is an absolutely key point that I want to cover briefly when we get back, you know I'm a long-winded windbag, but
[01:03:37.688 --> 01:03:38.289]  Cover it briefly.
[01:03:38.789 --> 01:03:43.053]  Then we're going to go to Tim, Steve, Ron, and many others.
[01:03:43.073 --> 01:03:43.554]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:03:43.594 --> 01:03:44.935]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, JonesReport.com.
[01:03:45.035 --> 01:03:45.656]  Check them out!
[01:03:53.576 --> 01:04:00.423]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[01:04:00.723 --> 01:04:02.105]  That's right folks, DVD.
[01:04:02.285 --> 01:04:04.507]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[01:04:04.647 --> 01:04:06.749]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[01:04:07.010 --> 01:04:11.954]  If you want to wake up your friends and families to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[01:04:12.295 --> 01:04:16.319]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[01:04:16.559 --> 01:04:18.340]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[01:04:18.420 --> 01:04:29.068]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plannable microchips, and much, much more.
[01:04:29.208 --> 01:04:31.109]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[01:04:31.309 --> 01:04:35.192]  Order your copy on VHS or TV today, and man the guns in the Info War.
[01:04:35.272 --> 01:04:36.853]  Order right now by calling 1-888-2533-139.
[01:04:36.873 --> 01:04:37.414]  That's 888-2533-139.
[01:04:43.658 --> 01:04:47.347]  Or order online at InfoWars.com or InfoWars.net.
[01:04:47.627 --> 01:04:48.349]  Again, that number, 888-253-3139.
[01:04:52.836 --> 01:04:58.119]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones introducing you to the incredible Berkey Solar Charger.
[01:04:58.319 --> 01:05:00.401]  Your source for free solar electricity.
[01:05:00.641 --> 01:05:07.765]  This portable system is the size of a book when folded and small enough to fit into a briefcase, handbag, or glove compartment.
[01:05:07.905 --> 01:05:19.432]  The Berkey Solar Charger has been designed to power the Berkey lights, LED lamps, as well as other applications such as mobile phones, radios, digital cameras, and PDAs when electricity is not available.
[01:05:19.813 --> 01:05:21.954]  It's multi-voltage capabilities, multiple
[01:05:21.974 --> 01:05:22.274]  I think so.
[01:05:43.055 --> 01:05:43.955]  At 888-803-4438.
[01:05:43.975 --> 01:05:48.037]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:05:48.297 --> 01:05:51.758]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[01:05:51.818 --> 01:05:58.821]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism, but globalism.
[01:06:07.005 --> 01:06:07.485]  We're good.
[01:06:26.335 --> 01:06:26.655]  I think so.
[01:06:54.455 --> 01:06:56.636]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:06:57.217 --> 01:07:00.078]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:00.178 --> 01:07:12.806]  Alright, we'll go right back to your calls here in a few minutes.
[01:07:12.946 --> 01:07:16.248]  I'd like to get your take on ABC News saying that
[01:07:17.128 --> 01:07:22.233]  Dennis Hastert, Speaker of the House, is definitely in the mix in the big bribery scandal.
[01:07:22.273 --> 01:07:27.818]  We have one congressman being caught with a freezer full of money hidden in cans.
[01:07:28.618 --> 01:07:32.101]  First place the police look, folks, is for those fake cans everybody buys.
[01:07:32.162 --> 01:07:34.964]  First place crooks look when they break into your house, I would add.
[01:07:34.984 --> 01:07:39.568]  But if you bury your money out in the field somewhere, they can't find it.
[01:07:39.628 --> 01:07:40.249]  But, side issue.
[01:07:41.386 --> 01:07:43.148]  We've got all this news swirling around.
[01:07:43.308 --> 01:07:46.130]  Israel has a long history of blackmailing U.S.
[01:07:46.170 --> 01:07:46.811]  politicians.
[01:07:46.851 --> 01:07:53.596]  You notice all this stuff is breaking right now when Israel is rebuking us daily in their press.
[01:07:53.636 --> 01:07:57.420]  Their leaders are like, we're bad because we haven't attacked Iran yet.
[01:07:58.420 --> 01:08:01.263]  And Obert was here yesterday saying, we've got to attack.
[01:08:01.603 --> 01:08:03.405]  They will attack if the world won't do it.
[01:08:03.805 --> 01:08:04.385]  The U.S.
[01:08:04.405 --> 01:08:06.427]  needs to and if they won't, Israel will have to.
[01:08:06.787 --> 01:08:09.590]  And Bush says, if you attack, we're going to attack.
[01:08:11.576 --> 01:08:13.298]  And it's going to be a giant diversion.
[01:08:14.940 --> 01:08:18.104]  So many people say that we're just going to attack Iran for Israel.
[01:08:18.765 --> 01:08:22.649]  Well, that's like saying my heart pumps blood just for itself.
[01:08:23.350 --> 01:08:29.618]  Well, of course we're going to attack Iran for Israel, but Israel is part of the New World Order agenda.
[01:08:30.467 --> 01:08:34.371]  It's like every other major industrialized country, and so it's all part and parcel.
[01:08:34.411 --> 01:08:48.505]  The globalists will use it for weapon sales, for a global destabilization, as a pretext to invade a whole bunch of different countries, to widen the conflict, and to, at the same time, basically set the precedent for the U.S.
[01:08:48.545 --> 01:08:51.088]  being the enforcer for the New World Order.
[01:08:51.681 --> 01:08:58.509]  And they also want it as a political distraction here domestically for a smokescreen for all of the other domestic corruption that's coming out.
[01:08:58.989 --> 01:09:05.476]  And the plummeting poll numbers, an attack on Iran will boost poll numbers for a short time.
[01:09:05.496 --> 01:09:08.640]  If you look at the trend, Bush is at 40%, 44% of 9-11 happens, he goes to 95%.
[01:09:12.444 --> 01:09:19.351]  He drops in a month, goes back up to 80% when they attack Afghanistan, drops again down to about 45%.
[01:09:19.391 --> 01:09:20.972]  They attack Iraq, goes back up to 65%.
[01:09:21.933 --> 01:09:23.275]  Now he's dropped down to 28%.
[01:09:23.715 --> 01:09:28.380]  He'll probably get boosted back up to 45% or so if they go to war with Iran.
[01:09:28.720 --> 01:09:33.405]  And if the war is really bad and we get big losses and they fire a bunch of cruise missiles into those
[01:09:34.480 --> 01:09:42.004]  Different waterways, and blow up a bunch of oil tankers, and oil prices go up to $10 a gallon, and yes, they're talking about that, if Iran is hit.
[01:09:42.024 --> 01:09:45.206]  I mean, we're talking about just insane prices, folks.
[01:09:46.186 --> 01:09:48.607]  I mean, they're talking about $200 a barrel now.
[01:09:49.048 --> 01:09:51.409]  Mainstream news that that happens, and that translates out to $10.
[01:09:54.811 --> 01:09:56.151]  This is getting crazy.
[01:09:56.451 --> 01:09:59.453]  I'm not saying that's going to happen, but that's what we're talking about.
[01:10:00.942 --> 01:10:04.224]  Then the oil companies will make even bigger profits out of this whole crisis.
[01:10:04.264 --> 01:10:05.785]  Meanwhile, we're bathed in oil.
[01:10:05.826 --> 01:10:08.928]  They've bought up all the oil refineries that are privately owned.
[01:10:08.968 --> 01:10:09.628]  Shut those down.
[01:10:09.648 --> 01:10:11.049]  We have the oil companies on memos.
[01:10:11.329 --> 01:10:16.013]  But everybody still runs around on talk radio going, gee, we wonder why we don't have enough fuel.
[01:10:16.353 --> 01:10:18.194]  Oh, it must be the greenie-meenies that did it.
[01:10:19.415 --> 01:10:20.376]  So all that's coming up.
[01:10:20.396 --> 01:10:21.296]  But first, we'll take your calls.
[01:10:21.336 --> 01:10:26.360]  But a caller in the last segment wanted me to talk about the 300-plus underground bases.
[01:10:28.942 --> 01:10:30.463]  Now, before I get into this, let me just
[01:10:31.049 --> 01:10:32.370]  Let me tell you something about Switzerland.
[01:10:33.831 --> 01:10:37.073]  Did you know that in Switzerland they haven't been invaded in over 200 years?
[01:10:37.513 --> 01:10:39.535]  They have the highest standard of living in the world.
[01:10:40.355 --> 01:10:43.117]  They have the highest average income in the world.
[01:10:44.558 --> 01:10:46.019]  They're incredibly wealthy.
[01:10:46.099 --> 01:10:47.260]  It's a beautiful nation.
[01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:54.285]  And every man at 18, and every woman now, is given automatic weapons, automatic assault rifles.
[01:10:54.845 --> 01:10:55.986]  They're given body armor.
[01:10:56.798 --> 01:11:05.100]  And they are shown in their local neighborhood where the local commander has stored the plastic explosives and rocket-propelled grenades.
[01:11:07.161 --> 01:11:08.862]  Yes, ladies and gentlemen, I'm not kidding.
[01:11:09.922 --> 01:11:11.542]  For those that don't know, just go research it.
[01:11:12.022 --> 01:11:15.463]  They actually modeled it 200-something years ago off of the U.S.
[01:11:15.543 --> 01:11:16.024]  militia.
[01:11:17.104 --> 01:11:18.384]  They said, that's a good idea.
[01:11:18.704 --> 01:11:19.725]  We've been invaded a bunch.
[01:11:19.765 --> 01:11:20.625]  We're going to do that.
[01:11:22.174 --> 01:11:38.522]  And in the side of every major mountain there are giant, for every town, there are giant underground bases that have hot tubs, in some cases swimming pools, that have their own water systems sunk deep into the rock, out of aquifers, out of springs.
[01:11:39.244 --> 01:11:41.906]  They have five to ten years of food supplies.
[01:11:42.266 --> 01:11:48.992]  They have armored vehicles, rockets, missile launchers, explosives, and it's just all there for everyone.
[01:11:49.032 --> 01:11:50.073]  Just weapons everywhere.
[01:11:50.093 --> 01:11:52.675]  And of course they have one of the lowest crime rates in the world.
[01:11:52.735 --> 01:11:53.736]  Excuse me, the lowest.
[01:11:54.256 --> 01:11:55.777]  You can go look at the UN Zone numbers.
[01:11:56.157 --> 01:11:57.318]  They are number one.
[01:11:57.338 --> 01:11:58.479]  They are the safest country.
[01:11:58.499 --> 01:11:59.160]  I forgot that part.
[01:12:00.926 --> 01:12:03.048]  And every year your home is inspected.
[01:12:03.868 --> 01:12:05.570]  Now they have the equivalent of the Fourth Amendment there.
[01:12:05.590 --> 01:12:08.852]  They're not allowed to come in your house without warrants except for the yearly home inspection.
[01:12:09.233 --> 01:12:17.039]  There are huge, multi-thousand Swiss franc fines if they can find your machine guns.
[01:12:17.699 --> 01:12:20.241]  You've got to have your weapons hidden.
[01:12:20.781 --> 01:12:27.787]  And they have to be so well hidden, it's the law in hidden trap doors, that if the inspector can find them, you are fine.
[01:12:28.487 --> 01:12:29.308]  So they are set up
[01:12:30.097 --> 01:12:33.159]  If they're invaded, they are mobilized, and everyone is scared to death of them.
[01:12:33.179 --> 01:12:34.139]  They're like a porcupine.
[01:12:34.600 --> 01:12:36.181]  A wolf doesn't bite a porcupine.
[01:12:37.241 --> 01:12:37.501]  Okay?
[01:12:37.541 --> 01:12:39.042]  An eagle doesn't grab a porcupine.
[01:12:39.402 --> 01:12:42.164]  It'll grab a tortoise and take it up in the sky and drop it and kill it and eat it.
[01:12:43.105 --> 01:12:45.346]  But nothing will touch the porcupine.
[01:12:46.306 --> 01:12:47.127]  Nothing will touch it.
[01:12:47.899 --> 01:12:49.760]  Because it's got spines all over it.
[01:12:49.801 --> 01:13:00.148]  And there's that little country, totally rich, absolutely no crime to speak of, just lounging on piles of gold, with weapons and explosives everywhere, with huge underground bases for their entire population.
[01:13:00.528 --> 01:13:02.430]  Now, let's look at China.
[01:13:02.610 --> 01:13:06.833]  Huge underground bases in every major city for about a third of their population.
[01:13:06.853 --> 01:13:07.934]  That's been in the official news.
[01:13:09.648 --> 01:13:17.873]  Russia has huge underground bases that are not fancy, but have two-year food supply, water supplies, underground wells for two years.
[01:13:18.913 --> 01:13:19.633]  Every major city.
[01:13:20.994 --> 01:13:22.015]  Germany has them.
[01:13:22.315 --> 01:13:25.216]  England has them to some extent, but not for a few months.
[01:13:26.737 --> 01:13:35.682]  Living in Dallas, growing up in Dallas, and if you're in big old parking garages you'll still see this, there'll be a yellow sign or orange sign saying nuclear fallout shelter.
[01:13:36.142 --> 01:13:39.004]  Do you know what the underground bases are for the American people?
[01:13:40.413 --> 01:13:40.894]  Do you know?
[01:13:41.795 --> 01:13:43.857]  There are underground parking garages.
[01:13:43.897 --> 01:13:54.550]  You can go there, and you can starve to death, and you can watch everyone urinate and defecate all over the ground, and you can all breathe the uranium and plutonium, and you can all die in a couple days.
[01:13:55.070 --> 01:13:55.691]  How's that sound?
[01:13:58.055 --> 01:13:59.616]  Guess how much the U.S.
[01:13:59.816 --> 01:14:02.076]  has spent on underground bases?
[01:14:02.557 --> 01:14:04.337]  This is the stuff we know that's declassified.
[01:14:04.397 --> 01:14:05.117]  Most of it's secret.
[01:14:05.418 --> 01:14:09.599]  But do you know what the underground excavations are?
[01:14:10.159 --> 01:14:15.361]  Just like in all other military spending, it outstrips all other nations combined.
[01:14:16.501 --> 01:14:23.163]  The Russians have an underground base in the Urals, which they've allowed people to go into, that can hold over a million people.
[01:14:23.584 --> 01:14:24.444]  You think I'm joking?
[01:14:24.524 --> 01:14:26.124]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's that big.
[01:14:26.705 --> 01:14:27.545]  What do we have?
[01:14:28.675 --> 01:14:35.380]  We've spent more than, and I say we, the criminals that run this country, have spent more than all nations combined!
[01:14:36.261 --> 01:14:39.784]  And what do you, what do I, the dumb sap, what do we get?
[01:14:40.544 --> 01:14:41.785]  We get a parking garage.
[01:14:43.286 --> 01:14:47.890]  You get a parking garage if you know where to find it.
[01:14:48.971 --> 01:14:50.312]  You get to go in a hole
[01:14:52.774 --> 01:14:56.056]  As if the big cities, if there is some type of nuclear attack, won't be hit.
[01:14:56.136 --> 01:14:58.777]  As if that won't be a smoldering slag heap.
[01:15:00.698 --> 01:15:01.479]  Slag heap.
[01:15:02.979 --> 01:15:04.560]  That's what you get, America.
[01:15:05.260 --> 01:15:06.061]  And so, yes.
[01:15:07.121 --> 01:15:09.883]  Why do you think Bush has his ranch at Crawford?
[01:15:11.764 --> 01:15:22.229]  It is well known that within one mile of him, that's not true, it's like two miles away, there is an underground railroad connected in and there is a entry point
[01:15:22.984 --> 01:15:25.326]  And they've probably dug one underneath this ranch for all we know.
[01:15:25.346 --> 01:15:27.227]  We know they've been doing huge excavation out there.
[01:15:27.707 --> 01:15:29.509]  They get really mad about bugs.
[01:15:29.929 --> 01:15:30.930]  This really makes them mad.
[01:15:31.750 --> 01:15:33.832]  Also remember the Naval Observatory where Channing lives.
[01:15:33.852 --> 01:15:36.053]  They were doing excavation for three years there.
[01:15:36.073 --> 01:15:37.274]  They were connecting a railway in.
[01:15:37.314 --> 01:15:37.974]  That was well known.
[01:15:38.475 --> 01:15:41.277]  They've got the Greenbrier Hotel with the underground railways to it.
[01:15:42.458 --> 01:15:47.201]  They've got these big underground locomotives that can go, what is it, like 10 feet an hour through solid stone?
[01:15:47.856 --> 01:15:50.717]  We know the government in the fifties purchased hundreds of these.
[01:15:50.777 --> 01:16:09.104]  We know that the spurs are all over Texas for some reason, running out to Arizona, New Mexico, Southern California, up to D.C., up to Minnesota, up into Canada, up into Ottawa, down into Mexico City, and more money spent than everyone else combined.
[01:16:09.164 --> 01:16:11.465]  I mean, Switzerland's got it for their whole population.
[01:16:13.706 --> 01:16:14.866]  You can go look at all these numbers.
[01:16:17.029 --> 01:16:19.089]  So, this is what you get, America.
[01:16:19.109 --> 01:16:21.050]  This is what your dirty government has done.
[01:16:22.190 --> 01:16:25.411]  They set up the CIA in 1947 with the National Security Act.
[01:16:26.051 --> 01:16:31.132]  Most of the federal funding went totally secret, and then they've got their 250, 300 billion now.
[01:16:31.152 --> 01:16:31.832]  I'm told it's grown.
[01:16:31.852 --> 01:16:33.532]  That's like five-year-old numbers, 250, I'm told.
[01:16:33.732 --> 01:16:36.893]  With inflation, it's 300 billion now, in cocaine and heroin money.
[01:16:37.333 --> 01:16:40.334]  And all of that just doesn't go in these guys' accounts, private.
[01:16:40.354 --> 01:16:41.734]  You know, a lot of it does go into secret ops.
[01:16:43.068 --> 01:16:44.248]  And all the rich people.
[01:16:44.408 --> 01:16:44.668]  I know.
[01:16:44.709 --> 01:16:46.289]  I mean people that are worth, you know, a hundred million bucks.
[01:16:46.309 --> 01:16:47.729]  I know a lot of people that are really rich folks.
[01:16:48.889 --> 01:16:50.610]  They've all bought personal islands.
[01:16:51.010 --> 01:16:53.951]  They're keeping bodyguards that live there full-time.
[01:16:54.351 --> 01:16:55.971]  Nicholas Cage has got two private islands.
[01:16:55.991 --> 01:16:56.771]  He just bought another one.
[01:16:56.971 --> 01:16:59.972]  The one he's had for a few years has got armed guards on it that are there full-time.
[01:17:00.272 --> 01:17:01.112]  A landing strip.
[01:17:01.132 --> 01:17:02.693]  They keep jets fueled and ready.
[01:17:03.773 --> 01:17:05.433]  And they're just, you know, low-level minions.
[01:17:05.913 --> 01:17:07.714]  But he's making about, what, a hundred million a year or so.
[01:17:07.774 --> 01:17:09.014]  He probably makes five movies a year.
[01:17:09.034 --> 01:17:11.475]  I think he gets about fifteen million a movie.
[01:17:11.495 --> 01:17:11.855]  I don't know.
[01:17:11.875 --> 01:17:12.215]  What is that?
[01:17:12.917 --> 01:17:14.678]  $30, $40, $50 million a year.
[01:17:14.698 --> 01:17:17.679]  But really, billionaires and people have moved out of the U.S.
[01:17:18.079 --> 01:17:20.080]  Man, they're living in Africa.
[01:17:20.120 --> 01:17:20.920]  They're living in Asia.
[01:17:20.940 --> 01:17:21.841]  They're living in the Middle East.
[01:17:21.861 --> 01:17:23.541]  They're living in Europe.
[01:17:23.581 --> 01:17:28.703]  They're all getting out in the last four years as if they're rats leaving a sinking ship.
[01:17:29.303 --> 01:17:30.564]  And it's very hard.
[01:17:30.584 --> 01:17:34.345]  I mean, you could buy an island a few years ago for just a few hundred thousand dollars, a nice one.
[01:17:34.665 --> 01:17:36.226]  Now they're $10, $15 million.
[01:17:36.486 --> 01:17:41.188]  Kay just bought a smaller one for $5 million because there's a run on them.
[01:17:41.716 --> 01:17:43.218]  And they put fences up around them.
[01:17:43.238 --> 01:17:44.519]  They put guard shacks on them.
[01:17:44.539 --> 01:17:46.161]  They've got armed men down there.
[01:17:46.441 --> 01:17:46.781]  Why?
[01:17:46.861 --> 01:17:47.122]  Why?
[01:17:47.162 --> 01:17:47.502]  What are they?
[01:17:47.762 --> 01:17:50.966]  Well, because they know if stuff breaks down, there's going to be pirates.
[01:17:51.126 --> 01:18:02.838]  And yes, folks, in the Caribbean, there are more pirates today in the Western and Southern Caribbean, and even the Eastern Caribbean, than there were 300 years ago, when Lafitte sailed the Caribbean.
[01:18:04.614 --> 01:18:11.140]  I mean, all the time, you go out there in your own sailboat on a cruise, I'm told, all the time, your sailboat shows up six months later at sail, and you're never seen.
[01:18:11.180 --> 01:18:14.423]  The pirates pull up, blow your head off, and then take your boat.
[01:18:15.664 --> 01:18:19.867]  Point is, is that civilization is unraveling, just like with the Romans.
[01:18:20.468 --> 01:18:26.873]  The Romans had it all, and they started bringing in foreign mercenaries to menace the other Roman lords, the other Roman senators.
[01:18:27.214 --> 01:18:30.116]  They brought in foreigners to leverage and get control.
[01:18:30.176 --> 01:18:31.657]  Caesar was really the first to do that.
[01:18:31.677 --> 01:18:32.118]  Did you know that?
[01:18:32.856 --> 01:18:34.457]  Brought in a foreign senate and everything.
[01:18:35.158 --> 01:18:36.799]  And Rome fell within 300 years.
[01:18:37.059 --> 01:18:39.001]  Well, we're on the fast track for that now.
[01:18:39.361 --> 01:18:43.164]  And these guys, I believe they're going to release a bioweapon and kill everybody.
[01:18:43.784 --> 01:18:44.365]  I've got to tell you.
[01:18:44.905 --> 01:18:47.927]  I mean, that's what everything I see, all the indicators are.
[01:18:48.207 --> 01:18:49.048]  They're going to release it.
[01:18:49.528 --> 01:18:50.509]  They're going to re-emerge.
[01:18:50.769 --> 01:18:51.450]  It makes me sick.
[01:18:54.122 --> 01:18:57.004]  Are terrorist cells or prime terror targets located near you?
[01:18:57.365 --> 01:19:00.227]  Where are military bases and hazardous waste sites located?
[01:19:00.467 --> 01:19:06.652]  How do you find the best area for solar, average rainfall, fish contamination advisories, and major transportation routes?
[01:19:07.052 --> 01:19:14.358]  In the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA, you will find the information you want with over 50 interactive parameters that you control.
[01:19:14.538 --> 01:19:16.720]  Find everything from housing prices and taxes
[01:19:16.920 --> 01:19:17.340]  We're good to go!

[01:19:53.559 --> 01:19:59.781]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[01:20:00.221 --> 01:20:08.004]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[01:20:08.344 --> 01:20:16.226]  Is this a flaw for the enterprise, or is our monetary unit, we call the Federal Reserve Note, forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[01:20:16.506 --> 01:20:21.268]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[01:20:21.588 --> 01:20:26.312]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[01:20:26.832 --> 01:20:30.675]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[01:20:31.175 --> 01:20:32.196]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.

[01:20:52.790 --> 01:20:55.291]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[01:20:55.351 --> 01:21:02.175]  Did you know that at the 29 Palms Marine Base located in California, a questionnaire was given to Marines stationed there?
[01:21:02.915 --> 01:21:06.177]  It discussed the United States military under UN command.
[01:21:06.900 --> 01:21:08.340]  Would the Marines accept this?
[01:21:08.360 --> 01:21:19.324]  The final statement to be answered, yes or no, was, I would fire upon American citizens who refuse or resist confiscation of firearms banned by the United States government.
[01:21:19.784 --> 01:21:21.204]  Is this what Americans want?
[01:21:21.224 --> 01:21:23.145]  Forced confiscation of guns?

[01:23:00.355 --> 01:23:02.657]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:23:18.443 --> 01:23:19.463]  Alright, I'm sorry.
[01:23:19.523 --> 01:23:20.824]  I haven't been going to your calls.
[01:23:20.844 --> 01:23:21.664]  I haven't been behaving.
[01:23:21.684 --> 01:23:22.704]  There's just so much news.
[01:23:23.004 --> 01:23:24.525]  Tim in Ohio, you're on the air.
[01:23:24.605 --> 01:23:25.005]  Welcome.
[01:23:25.405 --> 01:23:26.225]  Always a pleasure, Alex.
[01:23:26.545 --> 01:23:27.505]  Thank you for joining us.
[01:23:27.525 --> 01:23:28.726]  Good keyword.
[01:23:29.466 --> 01:23:30.946]  Do you remember a man named Phil Schneider?
[01:23:31.866 --> 01:23:32.166]  Yes.
[01:23:32.186 --> 01:23:33.347]  Talking about the underground bases.
[01:23:33.367 --> 01:23:37.828]  Yeah, if anybody wants to research on that, I've found a plethora of stuff under Phil Schneider.
[01:23:39.437 --> 01:23:41.498]  Quickly, a question yes or no answer will do.
[01:23:41.838 --> 01:23:48.142]  Is it worth it putting without prejudice UCC 1-207 slash 1-103 on your driver's license?
[01:23:50.263 --> 01:23:54.885]  I mean some people had success with that but I mean usually the courts are so corrupt they just ignore it all.
[01:23:56.146 --> 01:23:56.846]  That was my question.
[01:23:56.866 --> 01:23:58.167]  So you would answer no in that case?
[01:23:58.547 --> 01:23:59.228]  It's not really worth it?
[01:23:59.248 --> 01:24:02.990]  I'm not gonna give people a bunch of legal advice on all these US codes and the rest of it.
[01:24:04.891 --> 01:24:07.252]  Yesterday on C-SPAN there were a couple generals on
[01:24:08.400 --> 01:24:10.422]  And it was dealing with FEMA stuff.
[01:24:10.502 --> 01:24:15.986]  One was Brigadier General Benjamin Spraggins and another Major General Stanhope Spears.
[01:24:16.586 --> 01:24:22.211]  And it was real interesting the way they were supering underneath them their names and their titles.
[01:24:22.731 --> 01:24:29.997]  One, for example, for General Spears, it said, South Carolina Military Department.
[01:24:31.077 --> 01:24:31.938]  Adjunct General.
[01:24:33.279 --> 01:24:34.760]  States have their own military departments?
[01:24:36.001 --> 01:24:36.902]  They do now, Bubba.
[01:24:38.204 --> 01:24:47.309]  Pentagon generals with domestic operations, we now have NORTHCOM, we are now considered a war zone under military rule.
[01:24:48.289 --> 01:24:51.211]  Now is it true that the Army is actually under the control of the United Nations?
[01:24:52.532 --> 01:25:00.816]  To a great extent through treaty agreements it is to a certain extent, but it's more like the Globalists control the US and the UN and are merging their two assets.
[01:25:01.736 --> 01:25:06.899]  Okay, because I remember when during the hurricane Michael Brown had a quote on where he said FEMA
[01:25:07.492 --> 01:25:09.714]  Was the fate of the government for the entire nation?
[01:25:09.974 --> 01:25:10.274]  Yes.
[01:25:10.855 --> 01:25:12.576]  And I'm like, boy, that is very dangerous.
[01:25:12.596 --> 01:25:14.738]  When are people going to wake up to what these people are saying?
[01:25:15.519 --> 01:25:16.560]  It's very scary.
[01:25:17.100 --> 01:25:25.668]  And I remember I talked to you when Dr. Breeding was on a while back, and I told you about this girl I live with who has the implant in her neck.
[01:25:27.329 --> 01:25:32.714]  Yes, to control depression, it's a system that goes into the sciatic nerve.
[01:25:33.454 --> 01:25:34.876]  It actually goes to the
[01:25:35.984 --> 01:25:37.664]  What's the one that lays across the vocal cord?
[01:25:39.265 --> 01:25:41.085]  That goes up into the brain?
[01:25:41.186 --> 01:25:42.306]  Did I say sciatic?
[01:25:42.346 --> 01:25:42.966]  Am I wrong?
[01:25:43.846 --> 01:25:44.386]  I forget.
[01:25:44.747 --> 01:25:46.907]  It'll pop in my head in a minute.
[01:25:46.947 --> 01:25:48.708]  Yeah, it's clamped around that.
[01:25:49.348 --> 01:25:51.789]  And something very, very strange has been happening.
[01:25:52.109 --> 01:26:02.252]  And I wanted to ask you about it because every day, you could set your watch to it, around 3 o'clock in the afternoon, she just goes into these... She barks like a dog.
[01:26:05.667 --> 01:26:16.851]  Well, I know the Food and Drug Administration last year approved for depression these, it's called a nerve stimulator, and it's a nerve in the neck, vagus nerve, that's it.
[01:26:16.871 --> 01:26:20.071]  Of course it's not sciatica, that's the back.
[01:26:20.892 --> 01:26:24.633]  And it runs into the brain, and it's a device manipulating the brain.
[01:26:24.673 --> 01:26:25.513]  Oh, that sounds good.
[01:26:26.169 --> 01:26:30.312]  And they force millions of Americans on drugs, and we knew they'd start forcing people into these.
[01:26:31.073 --> 01:26:34.055]  I mean, what are we supposed to say here?
[01:26:34.736 --> 01:26:35.917]  Yeah, you wake up people.
[01:26:35.957 --> 01:26:38.919]  How much more... That's another thing.
[01:26:39.440 --> 01:26:48.106]  The biggest hurdle, which I want to share with all the listeners, to getting people to wake up is this theory of cognitive dissonance.
[01:26:48.146 --> 01:26:50.969]  And I've been printing out papers, and using that as my lead-in.
[01:26:51.289 --> 01:26:52.670]  Having people read that first.
[01:26:53.075 --> 01:26:58.256]  And then when you go into it and they'll say, oh, well that can't be true, then you can say, hey, Theory of Cognitive Dissonance.
[01:26:59.117 --> 01:27:02.077]  It's a very helpful tool when you're trying to wake people up for the first time.
[01:27:02.117 --> 01:27:03.117]  I wanted to share that with you.
[01:27:03.178 --> 01:27:03.578]  I hear you.
[01:27:03.598 --> 01:27:04.798]  Thanks for the call.
[01:27:04.918 --> 01:27:05.238]  You bet.
[01:27:05.298 --> 01:27:07.499]  Let's talk to Steve in Washington.
[01:27:07.519 --> 01:27:08.219]  Steve, go ahead.
[01:27:08.239 --> 01:27:10.979]  Hey, Alex.
[01:27:11.079 --> 01:27:11.380]  Yes, sir.
[01:27:11.900 --> 01:27:12.260]  Hey, buddy.
[01:27:13.300 --> 01:27:14.300]  Thanks for taking my call.
[01:27:14.360 --> 01:27:16.421]  I've got to tell you that I am a big fan
[01:27:18.348 --> 01:27:23.073]  And I'm also looking to get into the same sort of arena that you're doing.
[01:27:24.434 --> 01:27:28.839]  Anyway, I wanted to ask you a couple of questions.
[01:27:30.420 --> 01:27:30.720]  You there?
[01:27:31.241 --> 01:27:31.902]  Yeah, I'm here.
[01:27:31.922 --> 01:27:33.743]  Okay.
[01:27:34.344 --> 01:27:39.689]  You know, I've been doing a little bit of research, just kind of trying to find out a little bit of background.
[01:27:39.990 --> 01:27:41.271]  Like I said, I'm a big supporter of
[01:27:41.849 --> 01:27:48.214]  A majority of what I hear you talking about, but I found a couple of things a little bit disturbing.
[01:27:48.274 --> 01:27:54.059]  I was wondering about Tex Mars, who, as I found out, was the man who married you.
[01:27:54.779 --> 01:27:56.280]  Yeah, mm-hmm.
[01:27:56.421 --> 01:28:03.726]  Just wondered, you know, I found some information on him saying that he believes that homosexuals are possessed by demons.
[01:28:06.508 --> 01:28:06.889]  Okay.
[01:28:07.369 --> 01:28:08.330]  Any comment on that?
[01:28:09.076 --> 01:28:11.979]  Well, sir, I mean Tex Mars is a pastor.
[01:28:12.019 --> 01:28:13.540]  What do you think pastors think?
[01:28:13.580 --> 01:28:14.901]  What do you think pastors do?
[01:28:15.282 --> 01:28:19.946]  You're shocked that a pastor thinks that that type of behavior is demonic?
[01:28:20.506 --> 01:28:23.789]  That's what Christians believe is that that type of behavior is spiritual.
[01:28:24.750 --> 01:28:25.131]  Stay there.
[01:28:25.171 --> 01:28:30.215]  We can... I mean, this call is pretty amazing here right now.
[01:28:31.156 --> 01:28:32.537]  So we'll be right back.
[01:28:33.258 --> 01:28:34.479]  Let the caller continue.
[01:28:35.019 --> 01:28:35.420]  Stay with us.
[01:28:43.996 --> 01:28:46.982]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.002 --> 01:28:50.609]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:54.164 --> 01:29:01.046]  For months now you've been hearing about the incredible health benefits of Zango, the functional health beverage made from the whole fruit of mangosteen.
[01:29:01.186 --> 01:29:14.110]  What you probably didn't know is that Zango joined forces with the leading manufacturer and distributor of functional health beverages like Capri Sun, Sobe, Mystic and Red Bull to create the fastest growing business opportunity in America today.
[01:29:14.310 --> 01:29:14.710]  Are you sick of
[01:29:14.770 --> 01:29:16.111]  Are you tired of barely having enough money?
[01:29:16.271 --> 01:29:19.732]  Are you tired of working so hard yet feeling like you'll never get ahead?
[01:29:19.992 --> 01:29:23.794]  Are you ready to start investing in your own business instead of somebody else's?
[01:29:24.034 --> 01:29:28.996]  Whatever it is you seek, Dango could be the special company that helps you achieve your hopes and dreams.
[01:29:29.276 --> 01:29:30.977]  So take matters into your own hands.
[01:29:31.257 --> 01:29:35.239]  Create a future that doesn't depend on a fickle 401k and lateral promotions.
[01:29:35.479 --> 01:29:37.319]  Dango is what you are looking for.
[01:29:37.500 --> 01:29:39.700]  Find out more by calling 888-203-6633 or visit MangoCMarket.com.
[01:29:43.542 --> 01:29:44.084]  I think so.
[01:29:53.883 --> 01:29:56.904]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[01:29:57.204 --> 01:30:02.147]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[01:30:02.387 --> 01:30:06.748]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[01:30:07.049 --> 01:30:15.952]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[01:30:16.172 --> 01:30:19.794]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[01:30:20.074 --> 01:30:25.098]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[01:30:25.398 --> 01:30:32.104]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[01:30:32.617 --> 01:30:33.278]  What about you?
[01:30:33.918 --> 01:30:39.263]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.
[01:30:39.323 --> 01:30:40.343]  Call now to order at 1-888-803-4438.
[01:30:40.484 --> 01:30:42.385]  Order today and save $14 by calling 1-888-803-4438.
[01:30:54.788 --> 01:30:55.609]  Come on, Bill.
[01:30:55.829 --> 01:31:00.992]  Two weeks ago you were riding a bicycle, and today you're showing up in your new car and telling me you're buying a house?
[01:31:01.332 --> 01:31:02.833]  What did you do, rob Bill Gates?
[01:31:02.933 --> 01:31:04.914]  No, John, I didn't rob Bill Gates.
[01:31:05.174 --> 01:31:10.718]  What I did do is visit the website www.DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[01:31:10.998 --> 01:31:17.241]  That's where I learn how to make $3,000 to $9,000 each and every week, starting with my very first week.
[01:31:17.582 --> 01:31:19.763]  It's a simple program that does all the work for you.
[01:31:20.043 --> 01:31:23.484]  I'm already up to $25,000 just going on my third week!
[01:31:23.724 --> 01:31:24.184]  Whoa!
[01:31:24.524 --> 01:31:25.685]  What was that website again?
[01:31:25.705 --> 01:31:29.286]  It's www.DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[01:31:29.606 --> 01:31:30.706]  Now write this down, John.
[01:31:30.847 --> 01:31:35.148]  You should go there and learn how this program can help you become financially independent, too.
[01:31:35.308 --> 01:31:35.888]  Thanks, Bill.
[01:31:36.148 --> 01:31:37.349]  I'm going there right now.
[01:31:37.769 --> 01:31:38.409]  Check, please!
[01:31:40.195 --> 01:31:41.636]  Uh, you got this one right, Bill.
[01:31:42.136 --> 01:31:42.717]  Sure, John.
[01:31:42.957 --> 01:31:47.300]  Don't forget, it's www.DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[01:31:47.620 --> 01:31:49.301]  Next time, you'll be buying me lunch.
[01:31:49.481 --> 01:31:49.841]  Deal.
[01:31:56.905 --> 01:32:09.493]  We've got a clip of Israeli President
[01:32:10.191 --> 01:32:11.532]  Obert's speech yesterday.
[01:32:11.552 --> 01:32:12.714]  We'll play some of that later.
[01:32:12.734 --> 01:32:15.076]  A lot of other news as well.
[01:32:16.277 --> 01:32:21.502]  And I want to hurry through your phone calls, but right now we're finishing up with Steve from Washington.
[01:32:21.542 --> 01:32:32.372]  Steve, what shocks you by the fact that a Baptist preacher, basically is what Tex is, but he's non-denominational now, but you know, Baptist background.
[01:32:33.484 --> 01:32:43.288]  Well, it's not that I found that he didn't like it to be shocking.
[01:32:43.328 --> 01:32:45.969]  I found that he thought they were possessed by demons to be shocking.
[01:32:46.289 --> 01:32:53.452]  I was born and raised in a Christian church in a number of different denominations and I have never come across anybody that
[01:32:54.999 --> 01:32:59.363]  Well, I haven't read his particular quote on that.
[01:32:59.483 --> 01:33:02.005]  I believe his idea is that they're influenced by that.
[01:33:02.605 --> 01:33:06.629]  I actually heard him talking about it on... Well, sure, that's fine.
[01:33:07.169 --> 01:33:12.234]  So now I'm a bad guy, and you've got the inner scoop on Alex Jones.
[01:33:12.434 --> 01:33:15.316]  No, absolutely not.
[01:33:15.356 --> 01:33:17.118]  I just wanted to ask you what you thought about it.
[01:33:17.438 --> 01:33:26.523]  Well, I mean, I think that Tex Marr's a great guy, and he's a good friend of mine, and he married my wife and I without a marriage license, and I thank him for it.
[01:33:26.983 --> 01:33:29.704]  Okay, well, I got two other quick things, if you don't mind.
[01:33:30.264 --> 01:33:34.646]  One is that I had heard that the GCN network had been bought out by ABC News.
[01:33:34.727 --> 01:33:35.847]  Is there any truth to that?
[01:33:35.867 --> 01:33:38.508]  No, that's totally ridiculous and an absolute fraud.
[01:33:38.568 --> 01:33:39.429]  Bring up the next thing.
[01:33:39.849 --> 01:33:43.711]  Okay, the next thing is that as a member of the Remnant Saints,
[01:33:45.088 --> 01:33:52.613]  It's some mainstream Christian group that supports Jesus' second coming, and they made me an honorary member.
[01:33:52.633 --> 01:34:01.538]  It would be like if they made me an honorary member of the New York Golf Club, and then somebody said, you're a member of the New York Golf Club, and I'm not a member of the New York Golf Club.
[01:34:01.558 --> 01:34:02.719]  I don't even know if that's a real group.
[01:34:03.199 --> 01:34:06.060]  My point is, thanks for the call, sir.
[01:34:06.121 --> 01:34:07.501]  I really appreciate it.
[01:34:08.062 --> 01:34:11.263]  You know, I get a call yesterday, hey Alex, why are you still alive?
[01:34:11.304 --> 01:34:12.444]  Why hasn't the New World Order killed you?
[01:34:12.544 --> 01:34:13.705]  I get that call almost every day.
[01:34:14.600 --> 01:34:17.661]  And I get the call every week, you're owned by ABC.
[01:34:18.662 --> 01:34:29.187]  Or I get the call by... Sir, you should look at the people that make those types of claims and ask why people spend all their time attacking other truth tellers and trying to do all this.
[01:34:31.007 --> 01:34:39.711]  I guess I am owned by AKG, the German... And this will get picked up now, even though it's satire and it's not true.
[01:34:39.971 --> 01:34:41.012]  Let's be sarcastic here.
[01:34:41.773 --> 01:34:43.814]  I am owned and controlled by General Electric.
[01:34:44.214 --> 01:34:45.834]  I am owned and controlled by AKG.
[01:34:46.374 --> 01:34:48.075]  I am owned and controlled by Microsoft.
[01:34:48.655 --> 01:34:52.636]  I am owned and controlled... The microphone is... This is an AKG, too.
[01:34:53.316 --> 01:34:54.696]  I am owned and controlled by Mackie.
[01:34:54.736 --> 01:34:55.996]  This is a Mackie board right here.
[01:34:56.397 --> 01:34:59.917]  I'm owned and controlled by Skyscan Atomic Clock.
[01:35:00.117 --> 01:35:04.919]  That's... I don't know the name of those lights I've got right there, but I think those are GE bulbs.
[01:35:05.639 --> 01:35:11.040]  And I'm owned by Universal Audio, because that's the... That's the mic pre I've got.
[01:35:12.293 --> 01:35:15.195]  And I'm eating Austin's pizza right now, so I'm controlled by them.
[01:35:15.735 --> 01:35:17.516]  Let me explain that.
[01:35:18.737 --> 01:35:20.658]  We're on something called satellites.
[01:35:20.759 --> 01:35:35.128]  And when you call your grandma in, say, Cincinnati, Ohio, and you live in Los Angeles, California, your cell phone call goes through the cell tower, into the phone company, and up a satellite, in most cases, and back down.
[01:35:36.249 --> 01:35:39.891]  And I don't think we ever really think about who owns that satellite or what's going on with that.
[01:35:40.794 --> 01:35:48.459]  So that'd be like if you were driving a Ford pickup truck and I walked out and I said to you in the street, you're under Henry Ford's control, you support the Nazis.
[01:35:49.080 --> 01:35:51.201]  You'd go, that's ridiculous, I bought a Ford truck.
[01:35:53.282 --> 01:35:55.684]  There are three radio satellites.
[01:35:56.565 --> 01:35:59.166]  Okay, they're Clear Channel, ABC, and Jones.
[01:36:00.027 --> 01:36:02.368]  And those are the digital satellites.
[01:36:03.369 --> 01:36:06.271]  The network cannot afford the Clear Channel satellite.
[01:36:06.831 --> 01:36:10.374]  We did have it for a while, but most stations have the ABC feed.
[01:36:11.176 --> 01:36:21.244]  And so what you do is, is you go to them, and it was actually a suit years ago about this, forcing satellite companies to give other networks and third parties feeds.
[01:36:21.464 --> 01:36:22.645]  They don't like doing this either.
[01:36:23.046 --> 01:36:34.415]  You go to them and you say, uh-uh, we're going to buy the satellite feed from you so we can go out over the radio, because that's what radio affiliates have.
[01:36:34.775 --> 01:36:39.439]  They have a clear channel receiver, they have an ABC receiver, or they have a Jones receiver.
[01:36:40.071 --> 01:36:44.955]  And again, I guess because there's a company called Jones, maybe they're controlling me too.
[01:36:45.335 --> 01:36:47.537]  But all we have is an ABC Star Guide feed.
[01:36:47.577 --> 01:36:52.841]  Now, we have another feed, and I had this satellite guy on last week.
[01:36:52.901 --> 01:36:58.465]  It's communication sat something, and they actually own some channels on that.
[01:36:58.485 --> 01:36:59.766]  You go and you lease channels.
[01:36:59.786 --> 01:37:01.967]  There's thousands of channels on these.
[01:37:02.448 --> 01:37:06.491]  That'd be like if XN ever picked up my radio show, which we tried to get them to.
[01:37:06.891 --> 01:37:07.912]  They haven't because of the content.
[01:37:09.497 --> 01:37:13.320]  Then saying, because we're on XM, we're owned by XM.
[01:37:13.721 --> 01:37:26.732]  That'd be like if I was the Rolling Stones rock and roll band, and a Clear Channel rock station played, I Can't Get No Satisfaction, and then we said, well, the Rolling Stones are owned by Clear Channel.
[01:37:27.273 --> 01:37:30.736]  It is on its face, such a fabrication.
[01:37:30.876 --> 01:37:33.118]  On its face, so ridiculous.
[01:37:33.158 --> 01:37:34.439]  Yes, I have Microsoft
[01:37:36.736 --> 01:37:38.297]  Windows on some of our computers.
[01:37:38.357 --> 01:37:41.599]  Yes, I have Final Cut Pro on our Mac G5's.
[01:37:41.799 --> 01:37:45.000]  I am not owned by Steve Jobs and Apple.
[01:37:45.621 --> 01:37:47.542]  I'm not getting transmissions from them.
[01:37:48.782 --> 01:37:50.683]  But see, this is how these operatives do.
[01:37:51.524 --> 01:37:51.704]  Oh!
[01:37:52.344 --> 01:37:56.186]  He's got an ABC... He's an ABC affiliate!
[01:37:58.327 --> 01:37:59.488]  I wish we were.
[01:37:59.868 --> 01:38:03.750]  I wish ABC stations, ABC owned stations, there are some would pick us up.
[01:38:03.770 --> 01:38:05.531]  So they pick up Sean Hannity, who's their show.
[01:38:06.351 --> 01:38:07.892]  We're not on any ABC stations.
[01:38:08.012 --> 01:38:09.272]  I wish we were.
[01:38:09.392 --> 01:38:10.133]  Oh my gosh!
[01:38:10.493 --> 01:38:11.753]  That we tried to get on them.
[01:38:12.293 --> 01:38:14.094]  We're on mom and pops and privately owned.
[01:38:15.815 --> 01:38:20.557]  So, so, I've got Ray-Ban sunglasses, an Italian company.
[01:38:21.057 --> 01:38:22.898]  I'm controlled by, in fact, I'm putting them on right now.
[01:38:23.258 --> 01:38:24.538]  I'm controlled by the Italians.
[01:38:25.159 --> 01:38:27.219]  I mean, that's how sophomoric this is.
[01:38:28.040 --> 01:38:31.801]  And then there was another one that was Tex Mars, married me.
[01:38:32.762 --> 01:38:33.642]  Oh, Remnant Saints.
[01:38:34.640 --> 01:38:38.523]  A couple years ago I started getting emails about this, people who claim it was a Zionist group.
[01:38:39.304 --> 01:38:55.295]  So I went and I looked at it, and I looked at all the memberships, and it said honorary member Alex Jones, and it was a mainline Christian, conservative, pro-gun, anti-UN, not even a pro-Israel website, nothing about Israel on there, and they said we believe in the Kingdom of Zion and Christ's return, which is what any Christian believes in.
[01:38:55.315 --> 01:39:02.541]  You know, I mean, that's what's going to set down the New Jerusalem, and then a thousand years and all that stuff, it's revelations!
[01:39:03.586 --> 01:39:07.189]  You know, the island of Patmos and all of that.
[01:39:07.909 --> 01:39:13.112]  And so again, we have people that literally go out and they go, what can we look for?
[01:39:13.212 --> 01:39:14.713]  What can we misrepresent?
[01:39:14.813 --> 01:39:15.154]  Okay?
[01:39:15.494 --> 01:39:19.796]  There's a mainline conservative, Christian, anti-New World Order site.
[01:39:19.836 --> 01:39:22.358]  They've given Alex an honorary membership.
[01:39:23.260 --> 01:39:25.281]  And I've never emailed them and said, take my membership away.
[01:39:25.321 --> 01:39:25.841]  I don't care.
[01:39:25.901 --> 01:39:27.882]  So what if somebody says you have an honorary membership?
[01:39:27.922 --> 01:39:28.602]  What does that mean?
[01:39:28.842 --> 01:39:29.603]  We honor you.
[01:39:29.683 --> 01:39:32.304]  I think there's been hundreds of web awards we've received.
[01:39:32.824 --> 01:39:33.944]  Let me give my enemies an idea.
[01:39:34.005 --> 01:39:36.466]  Go find out one of those web groups that gave me an award.
[01:39:37.066 --> 01:39:38.426]  This will probably happen now, too.
[01:39:38.987 --> 01:39:40.087]  Say I'm with them.
[01:39:40.347 --> 01:39:41.288]  That will be good.
[01:39:41.728 --> 01:39:45.669]  But see, the key is, we've just burnt six minutes on this, seven minutes.
[01:39:46.070 --> 01:39:49.431]  The key here is they don't want the information covered.
[01:39:51.053 --> 01:39:56.100]  And most people through ego revel in being attacked or get mad about it and their whole shows are about it.
[01:39:56.120 --> 01:40:05.352]  Can you imagine people driving along the road in Southern California listening to us on a fine affiliate we have there that picks us up that goes into San Diego and Southern LA listening to this?
[01:40:06.158 --> 01:40:06.959]  They're going, what?
[01:40:07.139 --> 01:40:07.999]  I'm here for news.
[01:40:08.039 --> 01:40:09.480]  I'm here to hear about Hastert.
[01:40:09.520 --> 01:40:10.441]  Is he going to be indicted?
[01:40:11.061 --> 01:40:12.042]  Is he involved in bribery?
[01:40:12.082 --> 01:40:13.623]  I'm here to hear about underground bases.
[01:40:13.663 --> 01:40:15.584]  I'm here to learn what's happening with Iran.
[01:40:16.164 --> 01:40:17.205]  No, you're not going to hear about that.
[01:40:17.225 --> 01:40:18.986]  You're going to hear about a preacher that married me.
[01:40:19.546 --> 01:40:22.068]  You're going to hear about some website.
[01:40:22.488 --> 01:40:24.610]  You're going to hear about the beliefs in Jesus.
[01:40:25.370 --> 01:40:27.852]  And you're going to hear about, am I an ABC affiliate?
[01:40:28.292 --> 01:40:28.832]  Let me tell you something.
[01:40:28.892 --> 01:40:30.013]  ABC called up today.
[01:40:31.452 --> 01:40:31.993]  Which they won't.
[01:40:32.433 --> 01:40:35.295]  And said, Alex, we want to give you a syndicated show on 200 stations.
[01:40:35.755 --> 01:40:37.236]  Zero control over what you say.
[01:40:37.256 --> 01:40:37.996]  We want to put you on.
[01:40:38.036 --> 01:40:38.537]  I'd say, sure.
[01:40:39.177 --> 01:40:39.898]  Of course I would.
[01:40:41.979 --> 01:40:43.140]  But no, that isn't the case.
[01:40:43.220 --> 01:40:46.121]  So, this is how you do radio.
[01:40:46.842 --> 01:40:48.523]  You go over satellites.
[01:40:49.484 --> 01:40:51.345]  And that's why we need your money.
[01:40:52.105 --> 01:40:53.506]  See, I don't beg for money.
[01:40:53.826 --> 01:40:56.288]  I ask you to buy the videos, buy the books to support us.
[01:40:57.649 --> 01:40:59.570]  A lot of the talk show hosts have put into a kitty.
[01:41:01.027 --> 01:41:03.408]  To pay for other satellite feeds.
[01:41:03.928 --> 01:41:09.529]  We also have an SEPC feed that a lot of old stations have and still have receivers for that we're on.
[01:41:09.969 --> 01:41:12.249]  But the network pays a very small sum to be on.
[01:41:13.090 --> 01:41:14.790]  We carry Gary Brownfield and the rest of it.
[01:41:14.810 --> 01:41:17.171]  So I guess, all total, what is it?
[01:41:17.491 --> 01:41:18.311]  Four satellites.
[01:41:18.371 --> 01:41:23.612]  But only one of them is a real radio satellite.
[01:41:26.445 --> 01:41:28.165]  And so today I will be on the highway.
[01:41:28.185 --> 01:41:29.306]  I will be on a federal highway.
[01:41:29.326 --> 01:41:30.606]  I will be driving down I-35.
[01:41:30.846 --> 01:41:32.946]  Does that mean I'm for the toll roads?
[01:41:33.286 --> 01:41:35.927]  Does that mean I work for the federal government?
[01:41:35.947 --> 01:41:37.527]  I'm on a highway?
[01:41:37.547 --> 01:41:40.608]  I mean, my goodness!
[01:41:42.708 --> 01:41:47.669]  But again, it's very frustrating because you want to answer this every time it comes up every week.
[01:41:48.089 --> 01:41:53.230]  I'm sorry to you, the listeners, but I don't scream calls and I will respond to this stuff when it's brought up.
[01:41:54.904 --> 01:41:57.245]  And I would advise that listener to call them with those questions.
[01:41:58.226 --> 01:41:59.186]  But get more discernment.
[01:41:59.846 --> 01:42:04.509]  I can tell you're probably a nice guy, and you're probably irritated now that I'm irritated with you.
[01:42:05.969 --> 01:42:12.813]  But sir, let's just say hypothetically, and by the way, when I make this statement, this has been turned into, I admit I'm evil.
[01:42:13.213 --> 01:42:15.354]  The statement I'm about to make has been turned into, I'm evil.
[01:42:15.534 --> 01:42:16.174]  I admit I'm evil.
[01:42:18.715 --> 01:42:19.716]  I hate talking about myself.
[01:42:19.816 --> 01:42:20.536]  I have to do this.
[01:42:22.237 --> 01:42:23.438]  Let's say I was evil.
[01:42:23.538 --> 01:42:23.938]  I'm not.
[01:42:24.875 --> 01:42:25.775]  I do do evil things though.
[01:42:25.795 --> 01:42:26.276]  I'm not perfect.
[01:42:26.296 --> 01:42:26.736]  None of us are.
[01:42:26.756 --> 01:42:27.676]  We're a fallen creature.
[01:42:28.516 --> 01:42:30.317]  But let's say I was this bad guy.
[01:42:30.637 --> 01:42:31.237]  It doesn't matter.
[01:42:32.958 --> 01:42:36.459]  I'm here saying the evidence looks like Israel's blackmailing the Congress right now.
[01:42:36.519 --> 01:42:37.140]  They've done it before.
[01:42:37.180 --> 01:42:37.960]  They're doing it again.
[01:42:38.020 --> 01:42:38.920]  All the evidence shows that.
[01:42:39.200 --> 01:42:41.761]  Coinciding with a constellation of other issues, I'm sure of it.
[01:42:45.423 --> 01:42:46.623]  People need to tune in to hear that.
[01:42:47.948 --> 01:42:48.749]  It doesn't matter.
[01:42:48.889 --> 01:42:50.450]  I'm covering information.
[01:42:50.530 --> 01:42:52.071]  It's about the information.
[01:42:52.491 --> 01:42:56.454]  And a lot of it isn't just hit pieces or people innately being wicked.
[01:42:56.494 --> 01:42:58.595]  It's that people want to divert off into something else.
[01:42:58.895 --> 01:43:01.197]  It's frustrating every day to hear all this bad stuff's happening.
[01:43:01.457 --> 01:43:02.417]  And to have to deal with it.
[01:43:02.657 --> 01:43:07.080]  It'd be easier just to concoct some way to not listen to Alex Jones.
[01:43:09.862 --> 01:43:14.345]  I mean, I've had people walk up to me on the street and go, I used to like you, but I...
[01:43:15.229 --> 01:43:22.613]  I can't believe you did a horrible thing to a Christian family for ABC.
[01:43:23.213 --> 01:43:24.874]  Totally made up, total theater.
[01:43:24.894 --> 01:43:26.374]  It's like saying I'm Ronald McDonald.
[01:43:26.415 --> 01:43:27.195]  It's just not true.
[01:43:27.215 --> 01:43:28.315]  100% lie.
[01:43:28.816 --> 01:43:30.056]  And I'll just go, get out of my way!
[01:43:30.256 --> 01:43:31.037]  Fine, believe that.
[01:43:31.077 --> 01:43:32.357]  I mean, one time I got mad at somebody.
[01:43:33.418 --> 01:43:39.161]  I had somebody walk up to me and go, I can't believe you're secretly run by ABC.
[01:43:41.343 --> 01:43:44.325]  And they go, I want you to respond to that.
[01:43:44.405 --> 01:43:45.506]  No, just get out of my way.
[01:43:45.566 --> 01:43:47.488]  At a certain point, I just... Fine, idiot!
[01:43:47.868 --> 01:43:50.270]  Fall down on the road, let the dead bury the dead.
[01:43:50.550 --> 01:43:51.891]  You're going to be a slave.
[01:43:51.911 --> 01:43:53.012]  Your parents were slaves.
[01:43:53.252 --> 01:43:55.514]  They were slaves before you because you don't have discernment.
[01:43:55.714 --> 01:43:56.955]  It may not even run in your family.
[01:43:58.356 --> 01:44:00.097]  You're tailor-made to be lied to.
[01:44:00.357 --> 01:44:02.419]  You're tailor-made not to hear the truth when you hear it.
[01:44:02.619 --> 01:44:06.042]  You're tailor-made to not have discernment and to not know it when it's looking you in the face.
[01:44:07.062 --> 01:44:08.123]  Alright, I said I'd go to calls.
[01:44:08.163 --> 01:44:09.064]  It's almost impossible.
[01:44:09.991 --> 01:44:12.093]  Let's go ahead and talk to Ron in Rhode Island.
[01:44:12.214 --> 01:44:12.954]  Thanks for holding.
[01:44:12.994 --> 01:44:14.716]  Ron, Newport Beach, California.
[01:44:31.576 --> 01:44:39.442]  I can't seem to get anything straight here, so I need you to tell the people where you're calling three times where you're calling from and what your name is.
[01:44:39.462 --> 01:44:39.802]  Go ahead.
[01:44:40.182 --> 01:44:40.582]  No worries.
[01:44:41.883 --> 01:44:43.084]  One idea I wanted your opinion on.
[01:44:43.765 --> 01:44:50.189]  Right now it's my understanding that $10,000 is the fine for hiring illegal aliens knowingly by corporations.
[01:44:50.209 --> 01:45:00.736]  What would be your idea or your opinion if you were to take that $10,000, have the sheriffs locally hire bounty hunters,
[01:45:01.374 --> 01:45:06.456]  And split the $10,000 between the Sheriff's Department or County with the headhunters.
[01:45:08.137 --> 01:45:12.979]  You'd have tens of thousands of headhunters pop up overnight.
[01:45:13.959 --> 01:45:15.200]  Then you'd have a few accidents.
[01:45:15.260 --> 01:45:17.321]  The media would demonize it, but it's a war.
[01:45:17.741 --> 01:45:18.941]  We've got to defend the border.
[01:45:19.722 --> 01:45:21.362]  Yeah, they take asset forfeiture seizure.
[01:45:21.382 --> 01:45:27.285]  But what they've taken from you, even when drugs aren't found, no charges are levied, they still take your house, your car.
[01:45:27.545 --> 01:45:30.246]  What about taking stuff for real crimes?
[01:45:31.249 --> 01:45:31.589]  I agree.
[01:45:31.609 --> 01:45:59.607]  Let's boost it to $50,000 and let's take that and take half of it and give it to the state with stipulations at the state level that it's got to be for offense and armored vehicles and weapons and the other half, the $25,000 for counties to hire more sheriff's deputies expressly for defending the border and with those millions of dollars the counties can hire dozens and dozens and dozens of new deputies and it's a great idea.
[01:46:01.693 --> 01:46:02.534]  How can we put it forward?
[01:46:02.974 --> 01:46:07.158]  Well, sir, I mean, the government, listen, they arrested, what, in that one raid, 1,000 illegals, 200 employers.
[01:46:07.178 --> 01:46:07.579]  That is less than 1%.
[01:46:07.639 --> 01:46:10.681]  If they arrested 1,000 a day for 365 days, 365,000 is less than 1% of the total number of illegal aliens.
[01:46:10.701 --> 01:46:11.842]  We need 10,000 arrests a day for a year.
[01:46:11.903 --> 01:46:13.584]  That's why you need a free market system like this.
[01:46:26.221 --> 01:46:27.022]  I think it's wonderful.
[01:46:27.102 --> 01:46:28.103]  I think it's a great idea.
[01:46:28.923 --> 01:46:34.668]  I'm worried about bounty hunters, just because it would cause big problems and you wouldn't have a pool big enough.
[01:46:36.029 --> 01:46:37.910]  I think the pool would spring up by itself.
[01:46:38.931 --> 01:46:39.752]  I think it's a good idea.
[01:46:39.812 --> 01:46:40.312]  I support it.
[01:46:40.973 --> 01:46:43.495]  But see, again, it's a globalist agenda to break down the borders.
[01:46:43.755 --> 01:46:44.616]  They're not going to do that.
[01:46:44.876 --> 01:46:50.040]  Instead, Bush is going to have a total blanket, legalize all of them, and then having troops on the border will be a moot point.
[01:46:50.320 --> 01:46:52.682]  But this concept can be instigated by the county government.
[01:46:52.782 --> 01:46:54.624]  It doesn't require federal or state.
[01:46:55.237 --> 01:47:00.521]  I think it's a great idea, sir, but I mean, why not have the county take that money and just hire more deputies?
[01:47:00.861 --> 01:47:03.643]  Oh, I agree 100%, but you have to turn the key somehow.
[01:47:05.304 --> 01:47:06.005]  Anyway, I'll let you go.
[01:47:06.025 --> 01:47:10.388]  Well, you can have the sheriffs go out with people that have former military training and you can't have them as indentured servants.
[01:47:10.448 --> 01:47:11.829]  A posse is only for a limited time.
[01:47:12.249 --> 01:47:21.736]  You can have a regular posse and have the people serve 20 hours a week and they can go out and hire a hundred former military men in each small town and you'll have your force right there and pay them.
[01:47:22.136 --> 01:47:22.957]  Right, that's correct.
[01:47:23.684 --> 01:47:25.726]  I'm ready to pay taxes right now.
[01:47:26.386 --> 01:47:29.149]  I mean, I'll pay a high tax if it's directly to the border.
[01:47:30.169 --> 01:47:30.530]  I agree.
[01:47:31.030 --> 01:47:32.892]  Because, I mean, this is in the Constitution.
[01:47:32.932 --> 01:47:34.753]  Troops on the border is in the Constitution.
[01:47:35.193 --> 01:47:37.855]  When these Mexican troops shoot at our people, we need to light them up.
[01:47:38.316 --> 01:47:39.537]  I mean, I want warthogs.
[01:47:39.597 --> 01:47:40.418]  I want Abrams.
[01:47:40.498 --> 01:47:41.558]  I want to smash them.
[01:47:41.879 --> 01:47:44.121]  I want to go to Mexico City.
[01:47:44.141 --> 01:47:48.764]  I mean, when you've got a country attacking you and saying they own this country, that's war!
[01:47:48.964 --> 01:47:51.046]  In fact, I called to invade Mexico!
[01:47:51.386 --> 01:47:52.227]  You know, I thought about
[01:47:52.567 --> 01:47:53.928]  They're an enemy of this country.
[01:47:54.088 --> 01:47:55.608]  They've been trying to bring this country down.
[01:47:55.809 --> 01:47:58.230]  They're run by terrorists, but our government wouldn't do that.
[01:47:58.770 --> 01:47:59.650]  We're invading Iraq.
[01:47:59.670 --> 01:48:00.290]  They've done nothing.
[01:48:00.531 --> 01:48:02.091]  Mexico is a real threat.
[01:48:02.571 --> 01:48:04.632]  We have reasons to invade Mexico.
[01:48:05.233 --> 01:48:06.653]  We've already bailed them out twice.
[01:48:07.494 --> 01:48:08.034]  Exactly.
[01:48:08.074 --> 01:48:17.618]  We need to go down there, put a real government in, have a real election, throw out all these ten families that own that place, arrest every one of those crooks, just like we did Japan.
[01:48:18.458 --> 01:48:19.899]  Folks, I'm not kidding when I say this.
[01:48:22.679 --> 01:48:24.280]  Look, they've announced La Rica and Kista.
[01:48:24.300 --> 01:48:25.520]  They've announced this is Mexico.
[01:48:25.740 --> 01:48:27.021]  They've called it an invasion.
[01:48:27.061 --> 01:48:27.881]  Their government does.
[01:48:28.662 --> 01:48:34.804]  A country says that, sends 25 million of its people to do it, shoots at our police on a routine basis, killing people.
[01:48:35.044 --> 01:48:36.145]  Is that not a war, sir?
[01:48:37.265 --> 01:48:44.588]  If Iraq, if Saddam before the war would have sent 100 troops to the southern border and had them shoot at us, would we have invaded Iraq that day?
[01:48:44.608 --> 01:48:48.109]  Is that a question?
[01:48:48.209 --> 01:48:48.929]  Yes, that's a question.
[01:48:49.730 --> 01:48:50.090]  Probably.
[01:48:50.783 --> 01:48:52.546]  So, why aren't we invading Mexico?
[01:48:52.846 --> 01:48:58.955]  I think we should take 50 miles over the border, take 50 miles, take 50 miles, build a fence right there.
[01:48:59.175 --> 01:49:00.657]  They deserve to lose more territory.
[01:49:02.500 --> 01:49:03.722]  That'd be putting your thumb in their eye.
[01:49:05.009 --> 01:49:08.591]  Listen, I would go join the military right now if we invaded Mexico.
[01:49:08.831 --> 01:49:16.836]  If they said we're invading in three months, I would go join right now and I would put a pack on my back and I would go down there and I would fight those people.
[01:49:17.076 --> 01:49:21.899]  It's a country on our border, threatening us, shooting at us, saying they're taking over America.
[01:49:22.099 --> 01:49:23.640]  That's who you're supposed to fight, folks!
[01:49:23.820 --> 01:49:25.782]  You're supposed to fight people that are attacking you!
[01:49:27.002 --> 01:49:28.183]  You want a war, people?
[01:49:28.223 --> 01:49:29.024]  You like wars?
[01:49:29.224 --> 01:49:30.505]  Let's have a war with Mexico.
[01:49:30.545 --> 01:49:31.145]  Thank you, caller.
[01:49:32.572 --> 01:49:34.553]  I've said it, I think we should attack Mexico.
[01:49:34.813 --> 01:49:35.773]  They're attacking us.
[01:49:37.754 --> 01:49:38.574]  See how they like it.
[01:49:39.415 --> 01:49:44.637]  But no, our government's evil and is using Mexico to attack America for the globalists to break us down.
[01:49:45.077 --> 01:49:46.237]  Come right back and take your calls.
[01:49:55.023 --> 01:49:57.885]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[01:49:58.125 --> 01:49:59.726]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[01:50:00.066 --> 01:50:04.729]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[01:50:05.070 --> 01:50:11.814]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[01:50:12.134 --> 01:50:14.114]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has arisen.
[01:50:14.315 --> 01:50:17.155]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[01:50:17.255 --> 01:50:21.916]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[01:50:22.116 --> 01:50:26.517]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[01:50:26.757 --> 01:50:33.979]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[01:50:34.239 --> 01:50:36.660]  Discover the documentary for yourself before it's too late.

[01:50:54.784 --> 01:50:57.785]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[01:50:58.125 --> 01:51:06.948]  It's portable and requires no water pressure, so you can enjoy healthy drinking water whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[01:51:07.268 --> 01:51:11.950]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[01:51:12.410 --> 01:51:19.138]  The Bertie Lot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[01:51:19.539 --> 01:51:31.333]  It also removes foul taste and odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury, while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:51:31.793 --> 01:51:36.254]  The Murky Lights Rechargeable LED Lighting System is so bright it can be used as a reading light.

[01:51:43.496 --> 01:51:44.536]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:51:55.316 --> 01:51:55.616]  I think so.
[01:52:10.678 --> 01:52:11.319]  We're good to go!
[01:52:40.200 --> 01:52:43.281]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[01:52:43.441 --> 01:52:49.422]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[01:52:56.324 --> 01:53:02.345]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:53:02.365 --> 01:53:05.906]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:11.528 --> 01:53:14.791]  Jeff, Debbie, Chris, Nick, Rita, everybody, your calls are coming up.
[01:53:14.811 --> 01:53:17.934]  Got a whole other hour here in just a few minutes.
[01:53:18.675 --> 01:53:19.956]  That is not a radical statement.
[01:53:19.976 --> 01:53:24.220]  My point is, to boil it down is, we're invading Iraq.
[01:53:24.240 --> 01:53:25.842]  We're talking about attacking Iran.
[01:53:27.143 --> 01:53:28.164]  They've done nothing to us.
[01:53:29.111 --> 01:53:31.952]  Meanwhile, we have Mexico with their troops.
[01:53:32.132 --> 01:53:34.212]  I mean, I've had a bunch of Border Patrol on, Sheriff's on.
[01:53:34.592 --> 01:53:35.492]  They shoot at cops.
[01:53:35.532 --> 01:53:36.332]  They've killed cops.
[01:53:36.352 --> 01:53:37.193]  They've killed police.
[01:53:37.713 --> 01:53:39.353]  They've shot military in the past.
[01:53:39.373 --> 01:53:40.353]  They've kidnapped people.
[01:53:40.393 --> 01:53:41.373]  They're dealing drugs.
[01:53:41.893 --> 01:53:43.474]  They're saying this is Mexico.
[01:53:43.914 --> 01:53:49.555]  Their presidents, and of course they're run by our own government, put in there, are saying this is Mexico.
[01:53:49.615 --> 01:53:50.535]  This is globalism.
[01:53:50.915 --> 01:53:55.356]  My point is, if we're going to invade Iraq, for absolutely no reason, we've got reasons to
[01:53:56.517 --> 01:54:09.165]  Militarize the border, but no, Bush sends the Border Patrol down there, and then cuts back their numbers after 9-11, and then has the nerve to say, don't worry, the Border Patrol won't have weapons when they're down there on the border.
[01:54:09.205 --> 01:54:10.566]  Meanwhile, the Mexican troops are armed.
[01:54:10.926 --> 01:54:11.206]  Why?
[01:54:11.226 --> 01:54:12.928]  I mean, we're so pathetic.
[01:54:15.449 --> 01:54:19.712]  Oh, they'll have armed troops in America, in New Orleans and other places, but not on our border.
[01:54:21.016 --> 01:54:25.377]  And even Lou Dobbs will tell you, it's part of the plan of Oslon and the big banks are behind it.
[01:54:25.657 --> 01:54:27.538]  The CFR wants the end of our border.
[01:54:27.898 --> 01:54:29.739]  So I'm not literally saying invade Mexico.
[01:54:29.799 --> 01:54:31.959]  My point is that we have reasons to.
[01:54:32.700 --> 01:54:37.181]  And that's the only country in the world we have a reason to actually have a war with.
[01:54:38.001 --> 01:54:38.661]  It's incredible!
[01:54:39.562 --> 01:54:41.222]  I mean, I challenge you to debate that with me.
[01:54:41.602 --> 01:54:42.823]  We can talk about it in the next hour.
[01:54:43.943 --> 01:54:47.724]  Let's go ahead and talk to Jeff in New York.
[01:54:47.764 --> 01:54:48.504]  Jeff, you're on the air.
[01:54:49.045 --> 01:54:49.785]  Hey Alex, how are you doing?
[01:54:50.889 --> 01:54:54.751]  The resistance over putting up a border fence is just ridiculous.
[01:54:55.652 --> 01:54:58.193]  That would solve almost all of the problems immediately.
[01:54:58.253 --> 01:55:10.039]  They have a border, an almost continuous fence, except for some canyons in places, down in Costa Maya, right there on the border with Belize, and they're also on the border with Guatemala.
[01:55:10.519 --> 01:55:12.560]  You can see the Great Wall of China from the moon.
[01:55:14.401 --> 01:55:17.363]  There's no excuse for not fixing that border immediately.
[01:55:17.910 --> 01:55:20.731]  Alex, I'm the one who sent you the 522 Mason footage.
[01:55:20.991 --> 01:55:22.032]  Yes, it was excellent.
[01:55:23.032 --> 01:55:24.453]  What you did with it is great too.
[01:55:24.853 --> 01:55:31.676]  History Channel this weekend talking about, we're pushing them, we're pushing the media into doing things.
[01:55:32.196 --> 01:55:37.838]  History Channel and National Geographic Channel had Mason specials on over the weekend.
[01:55:38.502 --> 01:55:41.244]  And they're going a lot farther than they used to with these things.
[01:55:41.304 --> 01:55:48.009]  They actually addressed Albert Pike's quotes in Morals and Dogma about Lucifer running the organization.
[01:55:48.029 --> 01:55:52.453]  They showed the pentagram layouts of Washington, D.C.
[01:55:53.434 --> 01:55:59.038]  There really is a lot due in part to you, I think, because you're pushing this so much.
[01:56:00.228 --> 01:56:01.369]  Well, it's mainstream.
[01:56:01.409 --> 01:56:05.130]  I mean, most Masons aren't high-level enough to know what they're a part of.
[01:56:05.450 --> 01:56:06.771]  Most Masons are good people.
[01:56:07.391 --> 01:56:10.072]  It's like most FBI agents are good.
[01:56:10.393 --> 01:56:13.514]  But at the top, they are Lucifer-worshipping devils.
[01:56:14.114 --> 01:56:15.615]  And that's just the facts, folks.
[01:56:16.855 --> 01:56:20.137]  The pyramid on the back of the dollar bill is the perfect example.
[01:56:20.157 --> 01:56:21.077]  You give it all the time.
[01:56:21.097 --> 01:56:25.679]  The separation of the top part of the pyramid from the bottom shows compartmentalization.
[01:56:25.719 --> 01:56:28.000]  Their religion is about compartmentalization.
[01:56:28.961 --> 01:56:29.421]  I have a
[01:56:29.992 --> 01:56:31.573]  Another thing about Hillary Clinton.
[01:56:31.613 --> 01:56:37.594]  She gave a speech at the National Press Club the other day and I haven't heard the media talk about this part of it.
[01:56:37.634 --> 01:56:53.139]  They have been saying that she has an energy policy but here's a quote from it and she says, I propose that over the next five years we devote from the Strategic Energy Fund nine billion dollars into the Defense Advanced Research Project Administration for energy research.
[01:56:53.239 --> 01:56:53.879]  Yeah, DARPA.
[01:56:54.159 --> 01:56:56.060]  Yeah, that's not what they're going to do with that money.
[01:56:56.818 --> 01:56:57.858]  Of course, look, look, look!
[01:56:58.279 --> 01:56:59.639]  We're now being called liberals.
[01:56:59.699 --> 01:57:00.539]  I knew it would happen.
[01:57:01.640 --> 01:57:03.660]  Because we don't like Hillary for president.
[01:57:03.720 --> 01:57:08.182]  And now Roger Ailes, Limbaugh's boss, and all of them are out promoting Hillary.
[01:57:08.222 --> 01:57:10.083]  She's having weekly meetings with Rupert Murdoch.
[01:57:10.623 --> 01:57:12.563]  The Clintons are vacationing with the Bushes.
[01:57:12.683 --> 01:57:13.664]  It's just sick.
[01:57:13.764 --> 01:57:19.026]  Hillary's the neocon neocons, and everybody in New York, we gotta get her out of office so she can't run for president.
[01:57:19.586 --> 01:57:20.826]  Be quiet, liberal.
[01:57:21.026 --> 01:57:23.427]  You'll turn your guns in, then you'll be conservative.
[01:57:24.067 --> 01:57:26.268]  Turning your guns in is conservative.
[01:57:27.962 --> 01:57:29.863]  Big government is conservative.
[01:57:29.943 --> 01:57:30.824]  Third hour coming up.
[01:57:30.884 --> 01:57:31.304]  Stay with us.
[01:57:34.166 --> 01:57:38.389]  Order a copy of this show for your friends and family at GCNlive.com or call 877-300-7645.
[01:57:58.124 --> 01:58:01.885]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.305 --> 01:58:06.426]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:08.207 --> 01:58:11.868]  A just war is never preemptive.
[01:58:12.488 --> 01:58:19.710]  It's always when you've been attacked, normally through history, by some bordering nation trying to take your resources or trying to invade.
[01:58:20.710 --> 01:58:22.411]  Mexico is doing exactly that.
[01:58:22.971 --> 01:58:27.092]  And I said last hour, we have no reason to invade Iraq, we have a lot of reasons to invade
[01:58:28.346 --> 01:58:30.467]  Mexico, but the elitists are doing the opposite.
[01:58:30.487 --> 01:58:36.690]  They're using Mexico, a hostile, criminal, elite state, triple the resources the U.S.
[01:58:36.710 --> 01:58:42.032]  has, with a tiny elite running a bunch of slaves down there, using them to break down the U.S.
[01:58:42.072 --> 01:58:43.773]  Because Mexico, we've had three wars.
[01:58:44.893 --> 01:58:46.114]  One Texian, two U.S.
[01:58:46.174 --> 01:58:48.115]  wars, with the Mexicans.
[01:58:50.459 --> 01:58:51.480]  It's not a radical statement.
[01:58:51.520 --> 01:58:53.881]  I mean, we have them attacking us with rockets, machine guns.
[01:58:54.362 --> 01:58:57.484]  It's more dangerous than the West Bank, the State Department's own travel advisory.
[01:58:58.064 --> 01:58:59.265]  But you're not going to see that happen.
[01:58:59.305 --> 01:59:05.689]  No, they're going to be used, because they're a hostile America haters, to take over by that piece of trash, George Bush and the Democrats.
[01:59:06.030 --> 01:59:10.092]  And you're going to sit there and listen to your fake conservative talk radio, a lot of you, and just love it!
[01:59:10.372 --> 01:59:10.953]  You just love it!
[01:59:10.973 --> 01:59:11.353]  You love it!
[01:59:11.373 --> 01:59:11.833]  You love it!
[01:59:12.634 --> 01:59:13.374]  You just love it!
[01:59:14.335 --> 01:59:15.636]  I'm not talking to our general listeners.
[01:59:15.656 --> 01:59:17.978]  I'm talking about the scumbags out there.
[01:59:18.338 --> 01:59:19.899]  And you are your scumbags!
[01:59:21.309 --> 01:59:22.030]  I'm serious!
[01:59:22.090 --> 01:59:24.491]  We have a reason to go to war with Mexico!
[01:59:25.752 --> 01:59:30.896]  And don't think in a hundred years it's got a snowball's chance in Hades of happening!
[01:59:32.437 --> 01:59:36.440]  No, we're going to go invade a bunch of countries that have done nothing to us!
[01:59:36.460 --> 01:59:37.220]  8,000 miles away!
[01:59:39.282 --> 01:59:43.785]  Let's go ahead and, um... Let's go ahead and go to Debbie in New York.
[01:59:43.825 --> 01:59:44.726]  Debbie, thanks for holding.
[01:59:45.265 --> 01:59:46.789]  Oh, thank you for taking my call.
[01:59:46.869 --> 01:59:47.892]  I'm a first-time caller.
[01:59:48.092 --> 01:59:49.135]  Welcome to the airwaves.
[01:59:49.496 --> 01:59:50.037]  Thank you.
[01:59:50.759 --> 01:59:53.084]  First, I want to say I worked in radio for 15 years.
[01:59:53.104 --> 01:59:54.849]  You did a really good job explaining that.
[01:59:55.393 --> 02:00:00.256]  Because people that haven't been on radio wouldn't maybe understand all those details.
[02:00:00.636 --> 02:00:01.477]  I think you did a great job.
[02:00:01.497 --> 02:00:07.720]  Wouldn't understand that big companies own satellites, and if you want to be on the radio, you've got to go least time on a satellite?
[02:00:08.020 --> 02:00:12.123]  A lot of people don't understand that, and I'm glad that you explained it to them.
[02:00:12.163 --> 02:00:16.125]  When you worked in radio, what receivers do you have at the station you worked at?
[02:00:16.744 --> 02:00:19.949]  Well, we used to stream in from Texas, ABC.
[02:00:20.129 --> 02:00:23.134]  We weren't even live in our area.
[02:00:23.154 --> 02:00:27.601]  Yeah, ABC stations have the most receivers for that.
[02:00:28.402 --> 02:00:31.447]  Oh yeah, and we were live in the morning, and then we switched over to satellite.
[02:00:31.860 --> 02:00:34.061]  Everyone in the area thought we were lying, but we weren't.
[02:00:34.241 --> 02:00:35.262]  It was pretty funny.
[02:00:35.302 --> 02:00:41.705]  But my point is, if you want to be syndicated on a, you know, there's other tinker toy networks that don't have real satellites.
[02:00:41.985 --> 02:00:42.245]  Yeah.
[02:00:42.425 --> 02:00:43.225]  And I wish they did.
[02:00:43.285 --> 02:00:43.986]  I wish them well.
[02:00:44.086 --> 02:00:45.246]  I wish ABC would call you.
[02:00:45.286 --> 02:00:46.807]  I'd be jumping up and down for joy.
[02:00:46.827 --> 02:00:47.367]  Exactly.
[02:00:47.387 --> 02:00:48.408]  That's exactly what we need.
[02:00:48.908 --> 02:00:49.448]  Exactly!
[02:00:49.468 --> 02:00:58.774]  And I'm thankful to God I stumbled on your show and that's one of the reasons I want to call and just say, you know, there's a lot of information to be had on your show and shows like yours.
[02:00:59.234 --> 02:01:03.097]  If we just open our eyes and look at what's going on in the world, 2 plus 2 makes 4.
[02:01:03.517 --> 02:01:09.060]  It's a shame that a lot of people aren't seeing that today and I'm just thankful that you're getting the message out.
[02:01:09.161 --> 02:01:12.683]  One of the reasons I did call today, though, was on Monday night after
[02:01:14.043 --> 02:01:14.704]  24 was off.
[02:01:15.044 --> 02:01:17.485]  Here in New York, we get Fox 5 News.
[02:01:17.565 --> 02:01:19.026]  It's the news from New York City.
[02:01:19.286 --> 02:01:20.247]  It's not the cable news.
[02:01:20.867 --> 02:01:26.970]  And before the show actually ended, before 24 ended, they were talking about, you know, the upcoming news reports.
[02:01:27.631 --> 02:01:29.032]  Of course, they had Kiefer Sutherland.
[02:01:29.072 --> 02:01:29.972]  He was going to be on.
[02:01:30.312 --> 02:01:33.334]  And then they talked about the new terrorist threat in New York.
[02:01:33.794 --> 02:01:35.175]  And they hyped it up pretty big.
[02:01:35.415 --> 02:01:39.857]  And when, you know, I watched it, they talked about the Iranian terrorists.
[02:01:40.078 --> 02:01:42.099]  Yeah, they're connecting
[02:01:43.394 --> 02:01:47.136]  In reality, with fiction, it's all part of the brainwashing.
[02:01:47.156 --> 02:01:47.496]  Go ahead.
[02:01:47.956 --> 02:01:55.320]  Yeah, and so what really, you know, I was like, um... In fact, before they said who the terrorists were, I kind of thought, hmm, they got me from Iran.
[02:01:55.620 --> 02:01:57.761]  That would only make sense, and so, of course, they were.
[02:01:58.081 --> 02:02:03.464]  And what I found really unusual is the rest of the week, I've been watching mainstream media, and they haven't said a word.
[02:02:04.284 --> 02:02:10.007]  So, just on that special report after 24, there was going to be a New York newscast about Iran?
[02:02:10.027 --> 02:02:10.968]  Yeah, it's Fox News.
[02:02:12.037 --> 02:02:15.558]  And so they were reporting Iranian terrorists?
[02:02:15.959 --> 02:02:19.120]  Yes, Hezbollah is here in New York, sleeper cells.
[02:02:19.680 --> 02:02:23.822]  And they made a big thing, I mean they promoted it at least four times at the end of 24.
[02:02:23.962 --> 02:02:31.685]  And of course you know what will really happen, the globalists will hit Iran, then the government will blow up a few things in New York, oh, Iran hit us.
[02:02:32.335 --> 02:02:32.555]  Yeah.
[02:02:32.975 --> 02:02:33.656]  Oh, it's sick.
[02:02:34.116 --> 02:02:37.438]  Yeah, so I just wanted to call you up because I haven't heard anyone else talking since.
[02:02:37.458 --> 02:02:38.138]  We wanted you to know.
[02:02:38.178 --> 02:02:38.918]  Keep up the good work.
[02:02:38.958 --> 02:02:40.239]  Thank you so much for taking my call.
[02:02:40.339 --> 02:02:41.380]  Thank you for calling in.
[02:02:41.700 --> 02:02:43.701]  More great calls like hers straight ahead.
[02:02:43.721 --> 02:02:44.101]  Stay with us.
[02:02:46.682 --> 02:02:49.564]  What really happened September 11th and who stands to gain?
[02:02:50.291 --> 02:02:51.573]  Alex Jones here, America.
[02:02:51.773 --> 02:02:57.519]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest, most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[02:02:57.800 --> 02:03:03.046]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[02:03:03.346 --> 02:03:07.451]  Brace yourselves as the new world order program for world domination is blown wide open.
[02:03:07.691 --> 02:03:11.434]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world, where the military and the police are merged.
[02:03:11.694 --> 02:03:16.338]  Witnesses' populations beg for national ID cards, and yes, even implantable microchips.
[02:03:16.418 --> 02:03:22.682]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies, psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.
[02:03:22.723 --> 02:03:24.564]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.

[02:03:47.788 --> 02:03:51.910]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[02:03:52.030 --> 02:03:54.912]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[02:03:54.992 --> 02:04:01.715]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[02:04:01.895 --> 02:04:04.897]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[02:04:05.097 --> 02:04:07.478]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[02:04:07.618 --> 02:04:12.341]  Black Berkey elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove
[02:04:12.521 --> 02:04:27.092]  Trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as Atrazine, Benzene, Chloride and Chloroform, MTBE, Radon-222, foul taste and obnoxious odors like Sulfur, even Nitrates, and unwanted heavy metals such as Lead, Mercury and Aluminum are extracted.
[02:04:27.253 --> 02:04:33.898]  Supercharge your gravity filter today and order a 2-pack of Black Berkey Purification Elements for only $96 or a 4-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at

[02:05:53.713 --> 02:05:54.814]  Government cover-ups.

[02:06:07.547 --> 02:06:10.249]  Wide open phones today into this third hour, 1-800-259-9231.
[02:06:16.132 --> 02:06:20.035]  Chris and Nick and Rita and Josh and Johnny, all of you, we're going to your calls right now.
[02:06:20.095 --> 02:06:24.238]  And then I'm going to play a clip of the Israeli President, Obert, yesterday.
[02:06:24.258 --> 02:06:30.222]  Get more into the Hastert news that he may be under investigation for bribery.
[02:06:30.262 --> 02:06:34.245]  That was in the Village Voice and Salon a few months ago.
[02:06:34.265 --> 02:06:35.926]  We knew about it a year ago.
[02:06:36.801 --> 02:06:37.862]  And they're just being pressured.
[02:06:37.882 --> 02:06:39.764]  This is all blackmail to go along with the war.
[02:06:39.804 --> 02:06:41.205]  I've seen this before.
[02:06:41.785 --> 02:06:43.867]  So we'll recap that and give us some more details.
[02:06:43.907 --> 02:06:47.711]  Ken Lay, convicted on six counts of conspiracy wire fraud.
[02:06:48.451 --> 02:06:49.332]  Very, very serious.
[02:06:49.652 --> 02:06:50.473]  The Enron chief.
[02:06:50.933 --> 02:06:52.335]  Right now, let's go to Debbie.
[02:06:52.495 --> 02:06:53.295]  We already talked to Debbie.
[02:06:53.315 --> 02:06:54.657]  Let's go to Chris in Florida.
[02:06:54.697 --> 02:06:55.537]  Chris, you're on the air.
[02:06:56.398 --> 02:06:57.439]  Alex, thanks for being there.
[02:06:57.719 --> 02:06:58.079]  Thank you.
[02:06:58.996 --> 02:07:07.062]  I want to encourage you to share your dreams with us, since you seemed reluctant to expressing how you've had this recurring dream.
[02:07:07.282 --> 02:07:20.312]  If you want to recap how you and your family, who you had not been with at the time, went up with the HK-47 at a forced roadblock, you said, and you were forced to draw fire on the roadblock.
[02:07:21.161 --> 02:07:26.964]  I just want to encourage you because there are things that might happen in the future that we can't avoid.
[02:07:27.404 --> 02:07:40.290]  Not to say that it wouldn't be a dignified death, but since you're so in tune and you're so concerned, you're more likely to tune into these things than the average person.
[02:07:43.089 --> 02:07:48.370]  I don't think that these people who are jealous or envious really matter.
[02:07:49.430 --> 02:07:56.392]  If you're going to draw out their jealousy and their envy just for expressing your experiences, then let them be envious of your success.
[02:08:00.213 --> 02:08:03.193]  When you're really concerned, that's when you start learning things.
[02:08:04.233 --> 02:08:04.994]  I found myself.
[02:08:07.073 --> 02:08:11.616]  You said that in the past that you've questioned the human potential.
[02:08:12.216 --> 02:08:15.598]  I wanted to point out what Jesus' words were.
[02:08:16.479 --> 02:08:20.681]  He said that these things I've done, greater things you will do.
[02:08:20.701 --> 02:08:25.444]  He said, I do these things because I go unto my Father with whom there is no variableness.
[02:08:26.064 --> 02:08:33.409]  What he means by that, I believe, is that there is a state of stillness from where we draw our power.
[02:08:34.079 --> 02:08:36.601]  And that's hard for an evil to understand.
[02:08:36.661 --> 02:08:38.443]  They're so into dramatics.
[02:08:38.523 --> 02:08:48.211]  And like you said, their religion, they worship compartmentalization rather than understanding that we're really part of the God force.
[02:08:49.132 --> 02:08:59.320]  So I just wanted to encourage you to pass on your experiences, your success stories, and maybe you can invite other people to call in and share those success stories, too.
[02:09:00.714 --> 02:09:01.715]  Well, I appreciate your call.
[02:09:01.755 --> 02:09:02.375]  Thanks for that.
[02:09:03.395 --> 02:09:07.037]  No, I just had a reoccurring dream 12, 14 years ago.
[02:09:07.077 --> 02:09:16.722]  It had to be that period starting about 14 years ago of being married, having children, Mexican troops in Central Texas at roadblocks.
[02:09:16.802 --> 02:09:18.883]  And folks, I wasn't thinking about this at the time.
[02:09:18.903 --> 02:09:19.844]  I never heard of this.
[02:09:19.864 --> 02:09:21.885]  And it was so real.
[02:09:21.925 --> 02:09:24.046]  It was like other dreams I've had that have come true.
[02:09:24.086 --> 02:09:25.626]  It had that same feeling.
[02:09:25.667 --> 02:09:26.607]  It was terrifying.
[02:09:27.139 --> 02:09:28.400]  So, that's the story.
[02:09:28.800 --> 02:09:32.601]  I brought that up because we were discussing, is remote viewing real?
[02:09:32.621 --> 02:09:34.642]  And I was saying, I don't know if it's real or not.
[02:09:35.242 --> 02:09:37.403]  This isn't really the type of format show I have.
[02:09:37.443 --> 02:09:40.004]  I cover the facts that I can prove.
[02:09:40.865 --> 02:09:44.186]  But as for my successes, I'm in a war, folks.
[02:09:44.586 --> 02:09:45.827]  I mean, I'm real serious.
[02:09:46.567 --> 02:09:48.007]  This isn't some ego trip.
[02:09:48.047 --> 02:09:55.410]  This isn't, oh man, millions of people listen to me, and millions have seen my films, and oh boy, it's about Alex Jones.
[02:09:55.490 --> 02:09:56.751]  Believe me, I love it.
[02:09:58.402 --> 02:10:03.645]  When other people have bigger success than I have against the New World Order because this is about survival.
[02:10:04.565 --> 02:10:05.446]  This is about winning.
[02:10:06.246 --> 02:10:07.807]  This is about defending my family.
[02:10:08.608 --> 02:10:10.248]  And frankly, it's a great burden.
[02:10:12.350 --> 02:10:14.451]  A lot of times I wish I didn't care so much.
[02:10:14.571 --> 02:10:16.172]  I wish I didn't understand so much.
[02:10:16.252 --> 02:10:16.712]  I wish that
[02:10:18.118 --> 02:10:20.359]  I wish that it wasn't left to me to do so much.
[02:10:20.399 --> 02:10:30.385]  I get very frustrated that there's so much other work I need to do, that I don't do the best radio talk show sometimes, that I am obnoxious or irritable or, you know, whatever.
[02:10:31.826 --> 02:10:46.535]  And I get encouraged when the New York Times or the Washington Post or Vanity Fair or American Legion or Popular Mechanics or the Houston Chronicle or the Austin Chronicle or the San Francisco Chronicle
[02:10:47.694 --> 02:10:48.254]  Attacks me.
[02:10:49.075 --> 02:10:52.976]  Because I know the enemy is having to respond because we're effective and it's not going to work.
[02:10:53.016 --> 02:10:53.596]  It's a joke.
[02:10:56.537 --> 02:11:04.040]  But I do get frustrated sometimes by the COINTELPRO operatives because I can't give them attention and attack them and call them out as agents, which I know some of them are.
[02:11:04.581 --> 02:11:09.542]  Because that just gives them more attention and people don't have enough discernment in many cases to know what's real and what isn't.
[02:11:09.582 --> 02:11:11.503]  So giving attention to it just goes nowhere.
[02:11:14.574 --> 02:11:16.375]  Then a lot of it isn't just operatives.
[02:11:16.455 --> 02:11:19.556]  There are people who are egomaniacs who then say that I'm an egomaniac.
[02:11:19.596 --> 02:11:21.037]  You can listen to them and tell they are.
[02:11:21.077 --> 02:11:23.498]  It's all about them and they want to talk about themselves.
[02:11:24.078 --> 02:11:24.978]  Really, I can't stand it.
[02:11:25.138 --> 02:11:27.019]  I really don't want to talk about myself anymore, folks.
[02:11:27.539 --> 02:11:28.700]  I put the info out there.
[02:11:28.740 --> 02:11:30.400]  It's up to you to check it out and find out if it's true.
[02:11:30.460 --> 02:11:32.621]  It is true, but I don't want you to believe that statement.
[02:11:32.661 --> 02:11:33.442]  Just go look it up.
[02:11:34.002 --> 02:11:35.823]  Like Ronald Reagan said, trust but verify.
[02:11:36.683 --> 02:11:38.784]  We've got serious business to attend to here.
[02:11:39.804 --> 02:11:40.885]  Serious business.
[02:11:41.965 --> 02:11:43.426]  Let's go ahead and talk to
[02:11:45.115 --> 02:11:45.955]  Nick in New York.
[02:11:46.035 --> 02:11:46.916]  Nick, thanks for holding.
[02:11:47.376 --> 02:11:48.076]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:11:48.156 --> 02:11:49.097]  Thanks for taking my call.
[02:11:49.897 --> 02:11:53.799]  Well, the government national ID card propaganda machine is in full swing.
[02:11:54.159 --> 02:11:57.180]  I'm holding a copy of the Daily News on the front page.
[02:11:57.600 --> 02:11:58.040]  Guess what?
[02:11:58.401 --> 02:12:00.321]  Gigantic article on Mike Bloomberg.
[02:12:00.361 --> 02:12:03.823]  He wants to give DNA cards to aid immigration battle.
[02:12:04.423 --> 02:12:07.444]  If I can read the subtitle right now, let me read this.
[02:12:07.984 --> 02:12:13.927]  Launching himself into the immigration debate, Mayor Bloomberg offered a radical Big Brother style plan.
[02:12:14.588 --> 02:12:21.274]  Give every legal worker a fraud-proof identification card, sealed with a person's DNA or fingerprints.
[02:12:23.617 --> 02:12:25.238]  Let me just add a background to this.
[02:12:25.839 --> 02:12:32.365]  The face scans, the thumb scans for the illegal aliens, if they decide to sign up for it, they still won't be enforced if they're totally illegal.
[02:12:32.385 --> 02:12:33.546]  They're just gonna leave them alone.
[02:12:34.740 --> 02:12:48.468]  Everything they're having to do, citizens in most states have already been, since Texas since 93, under the Real ID Act, it all becomes law at the state level, federally, with a unified system and database, in 2008, a year and a half away.
[02:12:49.308 --> 02:12:55.371]  And state governments and others have been moving to make citizens give DNA at the driver's license facility.
[02:12:55.491 --> 02:13:02.115]  In my first film, which we still offer, it's one of my best, America Destroyed by Design,
[02:13:03.132 --> 02:13:08.116]  You can go see the film, and a large section of it is where I get arrested protesting the thumb scanning.
[02:13:08.156 --> 02:13:13.980]  It's riveting video, with the big protest we had inside the DPS office up in North Austin.
[02:13:14.901 --> 02:13:26.350]  And we're in there, and they're handing out hundreds of copies of the executive order for face scans, thumb prints, biometrics, and tissue swabs.
[02:13:26.410 --> 02:13:29.092]  That's already law under an executive order.
[02:13:29.452 --> 02:13:32.855]  They just never implemented it, so the plan is to do that, sir.
[02:13:33.519 --> 02:13:34.400]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:13:34.420 --> 02:13:45.045]  It even says in the article, in the very first paragraph, Bloomberg calls for the creation of a federal database that would allow employers to verify the immigration status of all job applicants.
[02:13:45.345 --> 02:13:47.366]  So this obviously doesn't just apply to immigrants.
[02:13:47.386 --> 02:13:50.468]  They're just using it as an excuse to roll out the national ID card.
[02:13:50.488 --> 02:13:51.409]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:13:51.429 --> 02:13:56.111]  And a lot of people say, well we have executive order, a lot of people say, well I won't give them my blood.
[02:13:56.211 --> 02:13:57.032]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[02:13:57.472 --> 02:14:00.974]  England already, at many checkpoints, were stopped for speeding textured tissue.
[02:14:01.634 --> 02:14:05.259]  And all they do is stick a swab into your mouth.
[02:14:05.339 --> 02:14:08.464]  Those are the largest cells in the body and the loosest cells.
[02:14:09.004 --> 02:14:13.510]  Thousands scrape off, no blood, no nothing, from the inner cheek.
[02:14:13.971 --> 02:14:16.014]  Imagine the cop is going to make you open your mouth.
[02:14:16.274 --> 02:14:17.416]  He's going to put a glove on.
[02:14:18.196 --> 02:14:20.078]  Or at the DPS office.
[02:14:20.098 --> 02:14:22.481]  They're already around the country starting to build the clinics in.
[02:14:23.022 --> 02:14:25.664]  These little holding cells of the clinic.
[02:14:25.845 --> 02:14:27.787]  I know you'll laugh, state police, if you don't read.
[02:14:27.847 --> 02:14:30.850]  In a couple of years you'll be doing it and going, he was right, but it's good.
[02:14:31.490 --> 02:14:40.340]  And they stick it in your mouth, get it, scrape it with a plastic scraper, put it in a little case, seal it, put it in a bag with your name and it goes to the DNA database.
[02:14:41.016 --> 02:14:41.256]  Right.
[02:14:41.356 --> 02:14:48.320]  I've also heard rumors of maybe a nationwide HIV testing for everyone, which would obviously be an excuse to get everyone vaccinated.
[02:14:48.340 --> 02:14:50.000]  So there's no rumor that's in Homeland Security?
[02:14:50.581 --> 02:14:50.841]  Right.
[02:14:51.681 --> 02:14:52.842]  My question is this, Alex.
[02:14:53.122 --> 02:15:02.086]  What do we do between now and 2008 in May, where we're probably going to have to give up our driver's licenses and take, or not take, the federal national ID card?
[02:15:02.146 --> 02:15:04.267]  Are you in New York City or are you in New York State?
[02:15:04.748 --> 02:15:05.548]  I'm in New York City.
[02:15:05.608 --> 02:15:06.468]  I'm from Brooklyn.
[02:15:06.929 --> 02:15:07.849]  I called you the other day.
[02:15:07.869 --> 02:15:09.170]  I called you yesterday concerning
[02:15:10.168 --> 02:15:11.750]  Doing the Truth Symposium in New York.
[02:15:12.050 --> 02:15:13.972]  Yeah, well, let me just bring this up.
[02:15:14.852 --> 02:15:18.956]  Two months ago they announced New York to be a fortress, quote, ring of steel.
[02:15:19.497 --> 02:15:21.219]  Right, on the west side, yeah.
[02:15:21.299 --> 02:15:23.581]  And so what that means is, well it's going to go nationwide.
[02:15:24.201 --> 02:15:24.882]  It's a beta test.
[02:15:24.922 --> 02:15:31.829]  The borders stay wide open, but they're going to stop you, check your ID, search you, do whatever they want, take your DNA at those spots.
[02:15:35.129 --> 02:15:35.809]  What was your question?
[02:15:35.829 --> 02:15:38.171]  Because that was the answer to it, but I forgot the question.
[02:15:39.111 --> 02:15:41.033]  What are we going to do?
[02:15:41.713 --> 02:15:43.554]  Sure, sure.
[02:15:43.594 --> 02:15:45.935]  Well, to know what we're going to do, we need to know what they're going to do.
[02:15:46.616 --> 02:15:55.101]  Nationwide, as Ron Paul has said on this show, and it's been in his reports he's written, libertycommittee.org, Ron Paul has laid out the plan.
[02:15:55.141 --> 02:15:56.942]  It's in the bills, in the legislation that's passed.
[02:15:57.742 --> 02:16:01.945]  Everywhere, there will be hardened checkpoints built into state, federal, and local roads.
[02:16:02.808 --> 02:16:07.772]  Life will be like it is with the TSA at the airports.
[02:16:08.232 --> 02:16:09.353]  Everyone will be searched.
[02:16:09.393 --> 02:16:12.095]  You will randomly be lined up against walls and searched.
[02:16:12.555 --> 02:16:14.177]  The schools are already this way.
[02:16:14.617 --> 02:16:18.480]  And if you don't have your driver's license, they passed this law in Ohio.
[02:16:20.144 --> 02:16:21.785]  It was the State Patriot Act.
[02:16:22.165 --> 02:16:28.427]  You will be taken in as a terrorist because they consider that not having your ID, and you will be arrested and taken to a camp.
[02:16:28.927 --> 02:16:34.849]  So we're about two years away, maybe even sooner if there's another terror attack to accelerate it, and I even heard
[02:16:36.429 --> 02:16:41.254]  The former head of the NSA, Bobby Inman, on KLBJ Radio two weeks ago saying this.
[02:16:41.615 --> 02:16:42.676]  We will all have this.
[02:16:42.876 --> 02:16:45.078]  It will be worse than Nazi Germany, sir.
[02:16:45.399 --> 02:16:48.502]  Just squads of armed paramilitary police running around.
[02:16:49.843 --> 02:16:51.805]  The TSA formed the Viper teams.
[02:16:52.866 --> 02:16:56.009]  And remember, in Dallas, Houston, and in
[02:16:57.327 --> 02:16:58.368]  Kind of babbling here.
[02:16:59.228 --> 02:16:59.709]  Miami.
[02:17:00.069 --> 02:17:05.133]  They're going to randomly go to shopping malls, the side of the road, randomly searching people.
[02:17:05.193 --> 02:17:05.513]  Remember?
[02:17:05.633 --> 02:17:07.114]  Randomly looking for terrorists.
[02:17:07.154 --> 02:17:07.434]  Remember?
[02:17:07.455 --> 02:17:08.335]  Yeah.
[02:17:08.495 --> 02:17:15.160]  So life will be like at the airport when they laugh at you and make you take your shoes off and say aggressive things to you.
[02:17:15.360 --> 02:17:16.861]  They've all been told to do this.
[02:17:16.961 --> 02:17:18.102]  This was the training.
[02:17:18.583 --> 02:17:20.224]  Now it's going to go nationwide.
[02:17:21.340 --> 02:17:21.620]  Right.
[02:17:22.000 --> 02:17:22.981]  So what do you do?
[02:17:23.061 --> 02:17:23.521]  What do you do?
[02:17:23.781 --> 02:17:26.502]  You expose this is happening in slow motion to condition us.
[02:17:26.983 --> 02:17:28.023]  You sue these people.
[02:17:28.103 --> 02:17:28.823]  You say no.
[02:17:28.843 --> 02:17:31.525]  It's going to be a line in the sand.
[02:17:31.585 --> 02:17:32.185]  I'm telling you.
[02:17:32.625 --> 02:17:33.666]  We won't go down for this.
[02:17:33.906 --> 02:17:34.886]  It's going to be hell on earth.
[02:17:34.966 --> 02:17:36.607]  But the border is going to be wide open.
[02:17:36.627 --> 02:17:37.087]  Understand.
[02:17:37.667 --> 02:17:39.348]  We will be absolute slaves.
[02:17:39.668 --> 02:17:42.009]  The illegal aliens will be first class citizens.
[02:17:42.089 --> 02:17:42.810]  We will be slaves.
[02:17:42.850 --> 02:17:43.330]  We'll be right back.
[02:17:46.275 --> 02:17:57.004]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials, bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.
[02:17:57.184 --> 02:18:04.791]  The revolutionary Berkey Light, with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements, remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:18:05.031 --> 02:18:08.194]  Harmful or unwanted chemicals are reduced to below detectable levels.
[02:18:08.434 --> 02:18:14.156]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury, while leaving the nutritional minerals your body needs.
[02:18:14.456 --> 02:18:20.578]  Made of durable Lexan, the material used in making bulletproof glass, the system is durable, rugged, and yet attractive.
[02:18:20.978 --> 02:18:24.859]  The Berkey Light is transparent, so there is no guesswork when refilling the system.
[02:18:24.899 --> 02:18:26.780]  The water level is always visible.
[02:18:27.000 --> 02:18:32.926]  The rechargeable LED lighting system is beautiful as a night light and as necessary in emergency situations.
[02:18:33.166 --> 02:18:37.110]  Get the Berkey Light, the transparent water filter for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[02:18:46.159 --> 02:18:46.599]  Gold.
[02:18:46.939 --> 02:18:48.220]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[02:18:48.480 --> 02:18:54.561]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[02:18:54.762 --> 02:18:58.563]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[02:18:58.923 --> 02:19:00.823]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[02:19:00.863 --> 02:19:03.164]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[02:19:03.304 --> 02:19:10.486]  The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as a common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weaker every
[02:19:10.486 --> 02:19:11.546]  We're good to go.

[02:19:49.811 --> 02:19:57.914]  Did you know that Senate committee investigations in the 1960s called the international communist movement the greatest conspiracy the world has ever witnessed?
[02:19:58.774 --> 02:20:06.037]  They said the communists had infiltrated into high government offices in the State Department and also advisors to presidents.
[02:20:06.954 --> 02:20:14.616]  Did you know that the Communist infiltration successfully stopped all FBI investigations into their secret activities?

[02:21:46.792 --> 02:21:49.533]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[02:21:49.553 --> 02:21:53.456]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:21:55.457 --> 02:21:59.700]  Later, I'm going to play this well-meaning propaganda song, thanks to you.
[02:21:59.720 --> 02:22:08.065]  We're also going to play Olbert, the Israeli Prime Minister here, getting into some of the blackmail we know is going on against our government.
[02:22:08.765 --> 02:22:11.167]  Right now, let's continue with your calls.
[02:22:12.057 --> 02:22:15.178]  Let us now go to Rita in Illinois, then Josh, Johnny, and others.
[02:22:15.198 --> 02:22:16.999]  Go ahead, Rita.
[02:22:17.039 --> 02:22:18.999]  Greetings from Global Region 5, Alex.
[02:22:20.340 --> 02:22:29.462]  I would like to specifically address Steve, who called, and then give anybody else who's listening, who comes across that point, a talking point.
[02:22:29.882 --> 02:22:35.764]  Because I see the bubble pop right in front of people when I tell them this, when they ask stupid questions like that.
[02:22:36.784 --> 02:22:40.065]  Go rent the Kinsey movie, and see what a nice man he was.
[02:22:40.446 --> 02:22:41.726]  Then you have to ask yourself,
[02:22:42.552 --> 02:22:55.858]  Why would the Rockefellers, because the Rockefellers are in the movie, they have to go before the Anti-American Commission, you know, why would the Rockefellers, you know, give all that sweet, sweet money to go kill for, so we can have happy sex?
[02:22:56.658 --> 02:23:01.420]  You know, and then, you know, a nation that lowers its morals conquers itself.
[02:23:01.880 --> 02:23:02.941]  But maybe not.
[02:23:03.321 --> 02:23:06.342]  You know, maybe they just wanted, maybe it's just that they were nice men.
[02:23:06.702 --> 02:23:08.103]  And look up Kinsey's Table 34.
[02:23:08.183 --> 02:23:08.703]  And then why
[02:23:10.618 --> 02:23:17.285]  And they are the people that says, oh yeah, all the men... That's right, they make movies about the psychologist...
[02:23:20.554 --> 02:23:31.578]  And then they don't even talk about how he admittedly tortured children, and then he'd make them live in little boxes, his own children, and then he'd write books about how he tortured his children, and then they act like he's some hero.
[02:23:31.638 --> 02:23:32.038]  Thank you.
[02:23:32.218 --> 02:23:32.938]  Oh, wait, Alex?
[02:23:33.938 --> 02:23:37.319]  In the movie, it's sugar-coated and it's still disgusting.
[02:23:37.519 --> 02:23:39.660]  Go have a look and then... No, you know what?
[02:23:39.680 --> 02:23:40.620]  See, I don't promote that.
[02:23:41.041 --> 02:23:42.101]  Well, it's disgusting.
[02:23:42.161 --> 02:23:43.281]  I rented it, okay?
[02:23:43.481 --> 02:23:45.722]  And it's disgusting and it's supposed to be sugar-coated.
[02:23:46.129 --> 02:23:50.613]  And it ends up in the air like, who's that, John Nash the Schizophrenic with his Endgame Theory?
[02:23:50.913 --> 02:23:51.613]  He's wonderful!
[02:23:52.074 --> 02:23:53.595]  He's gonna go find some more butterflies.
[02:23:53.915 --> 02:23:55.897]  Hey, I appreciate your call.
[02:23:55.977 --> 02:24:04.583]  You know, I didn't go see that film and I'm not gonna go see it, so... Let's go ahead and take another call here.
[02:24:05.644 --> 02:24:07.966]  Let's talk to Josh in Ontario, Canada.
[02:24:08.006 --> 02:24:08.727]  Welcome, Josh.
[02:24:09.327 --> 02:24:09.968]  Hello, Alex.
[02:24:10.008 --> 02:24:11.229]  Thanks for having me on the show.
[02:24:11.349 --> 02:24:11.629]  Thank you.
[02:24:12.031 --> 02:24:13.972]  Okay, well, I hope to see you in Ottawa.
[02:24:14.153 --> 02:24:16.194]  Ten minutes from where I grew up, that's pretty amazing.
[02:24:17.355 --> 02:24:18.696]  But anyway, I've got two things for you.
[02:24:18.836 --> 02:24:24.780]  I went to my MP's office the other day and got a copy of Bill 56, amending the Emergency Management Act.
[02:24:25.141 --> 02:24:25.401]  Yes.
[02:24:25.781 --> 02:24:34.988]  Now, it talks about rounding up Ontario citizens and putting them in emergency shelters, albeit sort of loose words and very entertaining.
[02:24:35.008 --> 02:24:36.889]  Well, of course it's for your safety!
[02:24:38.270 --> 02:24:39.031]  Well, I don't know.
[02:24:39.611 --> 02:24:41.873]  I'm pretty sure our Prime Minister is salivating over this.
[02:24:42.633 --> 02:24:46.476]  But anyways, I do have another thing for you too.
[02:24:47.797 --> 02:24:55.923]  Regarding the blanket put over at the Illegals in America, I have a truncated quote here from the Chief of Defence Staff of Canada, General Hilliard, that he said in 2003.
[02:24:56.883 --> 02:24:58.405]  We're not the Public Service of Canada.
[02:24:58.825 --> 02:25:00.066]  We're not just another department.
[02:25:00.146 --> 02:25:03.068]  We are the Canadian Forces and our job is to be able to kill people.
[02:25:03.444 --> 02:25:08.126]  These are detestable murderers and scumbags regarding the dissidents in Afghanistan.
[02:25:08.386 --> 02:25:11.867]  Now, I'll tell you that right up front.
[02:25:12.147 --> 02:25:20.390]  Now, maybe if we want to go and seek with them an agreement that if landless immigrants join the Canadian forces, they have an accelerated route to citizenship in our great country.
[02:25:20.990 --> 02:25:31.694]  Now, do you think a reason why Bush says to give illegal jobs in America that Americans don't want to do, this would include joining a volunteer army to invade Iran, you know, to swell the numbers?
[02:25:32.464 --> 02:25:37.148]  Oh, 20 plus percent of the troops on the ground in Iraq are not Hispanic folks.
[02:25:37.188 --> 02:25:41.832]  They're illegal aliens who became instantly legalized when they joined the forces.
[02:25:41.852 --> 02:25:42.592]  Thanks for the call.
[02:25:43.213 --> 02:25:44.594]  We have our Hessian military.
[02:25:44.634 --> 02:25:45.215]  Thank you, sir.
[02:25:45.255 --> 02:25:52.200]  Yes, I will be up in Ottawa City, Ottawa for the Bilderberg Group meeting coming up in about two weeks.
[02:25:52.801 --> 02:25:54.322]  I'm really looking forward to covering that.
[02:25:54.362 --> 02:25:59.006]  I'm mainly going to be there just to cover the media that's covering it to kind of show how this whole process works.
[02:25:59.941 --> 02:26:02.342]  I'm sure there will be some interesting news that we break for you.
[02:26:02.382 --> 02:26:03.703]  I'll be calling into the show live.
[02:26:03.723 --> 02:26:06.025]  I'm going to have Jack Blood sitting in for me.
[02:26:06.045 --> 02:26:06.945]  We appreciate him doing that.
[02:26:08.386 --> 02:26:10.907]  Right now, let's jam another call in.
[02:26:10.987 --> 02:26:12.408]  Johnny in Texas, welcome!
[02:26:13.189 --> 02:26:13.869]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:26:13.909 --> 02:26:14.830]  Hope you're having a great day.
[02:26:15.410 --> 02:26:18.852]  Hey, I wanted to point out, this is some of the problems that we face.
[02:26:18.952 --> 02:26:20.973]  A guy talked earlier about mobilizing.
[02:26:20.993 --> 02:26:25.716]  Well, you have to mobilize on a local level, and you have to do everything you can within your power
[02:26:26.802 --> 02:26:28.143]  To initiate that change.
[02:26:28.163 --> 02:26:30.865]  You can't just rely on Alex Jones and his information.
[02:26:30.905 --> 02:26:35.288]  People have to get out there in your own neighborhood.
[02:26:36.108 --> 02:26:42.052]  People always want to launch a huge mobilization now, but they don't want to start a small mobilization.
[02:26:42.413 --> 02:26:45.115]  Big mobilization starts with a small mobilization.
[02:26:45.615 --> 02:26:46.836]  That's how it's got to be done.
[02:26:46.876 --> 02:26:48.257]  It's got to be done on the local level.
[02:26:48.597 --> 02:26:54.741]  Another thing I wanted to point out, it's kind of ironic, I wanted to talk a little bit about the illegal alien problem.
[02:26:55.268 --> 02:27:00.790]  Out here in Apache Shores, we have an illegal alien, uh, that comes around and mows all the yards.
[02:27:01.270 --> 02:27:05.431]  And he mows all of my neighbor's yards, and they pay him, and oh, they're real happy to have their yard mowed.
[02:27:05.971 --> 02:27:09.233]  I think I'm the only one on this block that doesn't hire this guy to do this work.
[02:27:09.593 --> 02:27:10.053]  Stay there.
[02:27:11.453 --> 02:27:11.793]  Stay there.
[02:27:11.813 --> 02:27:12.974]  I want to hear about it on the other side.
[02:27:14.374 --> 02:27:15.294]  Stay there, John, and we've got a break.
[02:27:15.335 --> 02:27:22.737]  And I'm going to play this overt clip, this music clip, and I'm going to go back over a report we put out yesterday that you need to help us get out to everybody.
[02:27:23.408 --> 02:27:25.430]  And that's the report concerning the churches.
[02:27:26.330 --> 02:27:31.214]  That's the report concerning how they're being brainwashed to serve FEMA during martial law.
[02:27:31.755 --> 02:27:32.655]  You'll want to stay with us.
[02:27:36.499 --> 02:27:37.399]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.880 --> 02:27:39.501]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:40.422 --> 02:27:43.104]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.244 --> 02:27:52.568]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[02:27:52.928 --> 02:27:57.610]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Wright Frequency Technology.
[02:27:57.931 --> 02:28:05.535]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Wright discovered that disease organisms could be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:28:05.895 --> 02:28:12.739]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:28:12.959 --> 02:28:14.320]  There are no side effects!
[02:28:14.660 --> 02:28:18.282]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[02:28:18.583 --> 02:28:25.647]  BioSolutions has over 550 programmed auto sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[02:28:25.907 --> 02:28:28.909]  Customer satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.
[02:28:29.329 --> 02:28:31.851]  Ask about our spring special now in progress.
[02:28:32.111 --> 02:28:35.393]  For more information call BioSolutions toll free at 866-885-6625.
[02:28:38.655 --> 02:28:39.076]  That's 866-885-6625.
[02:28:39.117 --> 02:28:40.140]  Once again, that's 866-885-6625.
[02:28:46.537 --> 02:28:51.502]  Now you can bring Berkey Purification Power anywhere with the Sport Berkey Filtration Bottle.
[02:28:51.822 --> 02:28:57.267]  Ideal for sporting games, camping or boating, or Sport Berkey is small enough to store in your glove box.
[02:28:57.287 --> 02:29:01.591]  So it's ideal backup for unexpected emergencies like blackouts, floods or earthquakes.
[02:29:01.931 --> 02:29:04.954]  It's simply the best personal water filtration system available.
[02:29:05.254 --> 02:29:08.697]  So effective you can drink raw, untreated water from lakes, rivers and streams.
[02:29:09.017 --> 02:29:18.364]  Unlike other sport bottles, the Sport Berkey's patented filter formulation is so powerful it removes cysts, parasites, harmful bacteria, and chemicals like herbicides and pesticides.
[02:29:18.625 --> 02:29:22.127]  It even reduces radon-222, lead, and other heavy metals.
[02:29:22.367 --> 02:29:29.473]  This lightweight, rugged 22-ounce filter is small enough to go everywhere, so take one to work and keep another in your glove box for emergencies.
[02:29:29.713 --> 02:29:31.595]  Get the Berkey Sport for only $39.00.

[02:29:46.403 --> 02:29:48.725]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here with an important question.
[02:29:48.985 --> 02:29:51.027]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[02:29:51.167 --> 02:29:58.214]  I mean real hard to find all natural pure soap that contains no dyes, perfumes, deodorants, detergents, or other dangerous toxins.
[02:29:58.474 --> 02:30:07.022]  The Calvin Pure Soap Company, for the past 57 years, has been making triple concentrated pure soaps exclusively for healthcare professionals and hospitals.
[02:30:07.142 --> 02:30:07.362]  Yes!
[02:30:07.382 --> 02:30:12.065]  Now for the first time, Calbin Pure Soap is available factory direct to you and your family.

[02:31:01.635 --> 02:31:15.882]  I'm very excited and proud and honored and thankful to announce that Ray McGovern, Senior CIA Analyst, 27 years, Ronald Reagan, George Bush Senior, will be at our big 9-11 conference coming up June 24th and 25th.
[02:31:15.902 --> 02:31:16.723]  He's only been to one other.
[02:31:18.411 --> 02:31:19.552]  And this is going to be amazing.
[02:31:19.612 --> 02:31:22.634]  He's going to be there speaking as one of the key speakers on the second day.
[02:31:22.654 --> 02:31:25.015]  We've got Professor Stephen Jones on the first.
[02:31:25.156 --> 02:31:26.557]  Other surprise guests.
[02:31:26.597 --> 02:31:28.978]  I bet you can imagine who are confirmed.
[02:31:29.018 --> 02:31:29.418]  It's really there.
[02:31:29.438 --> 02:31:30.159]  I didn't even have this.
[02:31:30.879 --> 02:31:33.942]  And we're going to have a bunch of other top people, so you don't want to miss this.
[02:31:33.962 --> 02:31:38.105]  Get your tickets at infowars.com now before they all go.
[02:31:38.506 --> 02:31:39.286]  They are going quick.
[02:31:39.306 --> 02:31:40.567]  It's going to be a huge event.
[02:31:40.627 --> 02:31:43.450]  Two days, June 24th and 25th in Los Angeles.
[02:31:43.750 --> 02:31:45.011]  Take a whole vacation out of it.
[02:31:45.552 --> 02:31:46.352]  Take your time then.
[02:31:46.412 --> 02:31:54.619]  Go visit some of the Southern California sites while you're at it, especially if you're in Utah or Colorado or Arizona or Oregon or Washington and nearby.
[02:31:54.920 --> 02:31:57.362]  Or fly in from Texas or Kansas or
[02:31:57.902 --> 02:32:00.305]  Illinois, or New York, Florida, whatever.
[02:32:00.365 --> 02:32:01.266]  Take the whole family.
[02:32:01.846 --> 02:32:06.371]  Tickets are as low as $34 a piece when you get multiple tickets at InfoWars.com.
[02:32:06.391 --> 02:32:09.194]  We do that to encourage more people to come and bring their families.
[02:32:09.834 --> 02:32:11.096]  And it's just going to be amazing.
[02:32:11.136 --> 02:32:13.138]  We'll premiere my new film, Terror Storm, there.
[02:32:14.499 --> 02:32:16.822]  Which isn't even complete yet, and it's such a good film.
[02:32:17.462 --> 02:32:18.563]  We're basically done with the film.
[02:32:18.583 --> 02:32:20.045]  Now we're doing the music and other things with it.
[02:32:21.357 --> 02:32:23.859]  So, go to InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:32:23.879 --> 02:32:27.661]  There's a big banner at the top that links to AmericanScholarSymposium.org.
[02:32:27.681 --> 02:32:32.944]  Get your tickets right there, or you can call and get them and we'll email you a ticket with your name and your ticket number.
[02:32:32.984 --> 02:32:33.845]  You'll get a wristband.
[02:32:34.085 --> 02:32:36.106]  There's only one check-in, so it's easy getting in and out.
[02:32:36.826 --> 02:32:45.652]  And then at the same time, if you don't have a computer, we will mail you a ticket, but we're going to have to cut that off, I think, about ten days into
[02:32:47.276 --> 02:32:52.220]  About 10 days or so into June, so we have time to mail you the ticket out.
[02:32:52.660 --> 02:32:54.562]  You call the toll-free number.
[02:32:55.022 --> 02:32:55.503]  It's 1-888-253-3139.
[02:32:55.523 --> 02:32:55.623]  888-253-3139.
[02:32:55.643 --> 02:32:58.105]  And remember what the engine of this broadcast is.
[02:32:58.445 --> 02:33:03.289]  It is you, the listeners, the supporters, getting the books and videos we carry by other wonderful authors.
[02:33:13.146 --> 02:33:19.489]  You support us, you get good information, and you support the authors and the filmmakers that have made the books and videos I carry.
[02:33:19.509 --> 02:33:24.671]  And when you get our videos, you really support us, and the books I've written are the books that I've published.

[02:34:45.047 --> 02:34:45.687]  Please support us.
[02:34:45.987 --> 02:34:48.108]  No one works harder than myself and my team.
[02:34:48.208 --> 02:34:49.108]  And we know what we're doing.
[02:34:49.328 --> 02:34:50.228]  We're on the front lines.
[02:34:50.268 --> 02:34:52.028]  We're having an effect thanks to you.
[02:34:52.048 --> 02:34:53.949]  So I want to thank those that have supported us.
[02:34:54.009 --> 02:35:01.230]  If you have supported us in the past, think about supporting us again by getting the videos, by getting some of the films you haven't gotten, some of the other books and videos we've added.
[02:35:01.250 --> 02:35:05.671]  And if you've never supported us, we really do need your support because we're turning the heat up.
[02:35:06.673 --> 02:35:08.454]  You literally put gas in our tank.
[02:35:08.675 --> 02:35:09.955]  It's like we're an armored vehicle.
[02:35:09.975 --> 02:35:11.436]  We're running over the New World Order.
[02:35:11.697 --> 02:35:12.437]  We need fuel.
[02:35:12.577 --> 02:35:13.098]  You do that.
[02:35:14.258 --> 02:35:18.361]  We've been running over so many of the enemy right now and strafing them that we're getting low on fuel.
[02:35:18.381 --> 02:35:19.062]  We need support.
[02:35:19.662 --> 02:35:24.566]  Alright, let's go ahead and take another call.
[02:35:24.586 --> 02:35:25.826]  Let's go back to Johnny in Texas.
[02:35:25.866 --> 02:35:28.128]  He was talking about hiring the illegal aliens.
[02:35:28.168 --> 02:35:28.488]  Go ahead.
[02:35:29.349 --> 02:35:32.991]  Yeah, it's really bizarre here in my neighborhood.
[02:35:33.172 --> 02:35:35.073]  Most of the neighbors, like I said, they've hired
[02:35:35.649 --> 02:35:37.550]  This guy to do this work.
[02:35:37.871 --> 02:35:39.231]  Everybody knows where he lives.
[02:35:40.332 --> 02:35:42.474]  The police know he's here.
[02:35:42.534 --> 02:35:43.774]  The sheriffs know he's here.
[02:35:44.115 --> 02:35:49.058]  He drives around with no license in a pickup truck with no registration.
[02:35:49.078 --> 02:35:52.921]  This guy has his wife here and his three kids.
[02:35:53.681 --> 02:35:55.402]  And here's the problem, okay?
[02:35:55.462 --> 02:35:56.203]  They're illegals.
[02:35:56.243 --> 02:35:56.643]  They're here.
[02:35:56.683 --> 02:35:57.183]  They're working.
[02:35:57.203 --> 02:35:59.145]  They're getting to cheat the system.
[02:35:59.165 --> 02:36:01.466]  They're not having to compete in the system like we are.
[02:36:01.486 --> 02:36:03.748]  I bet your neighbors have all got George W. stickers.
[02:36:04.577 --> 02:36:06.241]  No, that's the strange part.
[02:36:06.622 --> 02:36:07.905]  That is the really strange part.
[02:36:08.286 --> 02:36:13.037]  My neighbors are what you would call, oh, I don't know, old liberal hippies.
[02:36:14.468 --> 02:36:17.410]  So, it's a total contradiction.
[02:36:17.790 --> 02:36:19.151]  You think these people would know better.
[02:36:19.611 --> 02:36:20.112]  And I do.
[02:36:20.172 --> 02:36:24.895]  I feel like a guy on an island, you know, where nobody cares.
[02:36:25.235 --> 02:36:26.075]  The police know.
[02:36:26.356 --> 02:36:27.296]  They've been informed.
[02:36:27.576 --> 02:36:29.317]  He's been here over a year.
[02:36:29.377 --> 02:36:34.661]  Hey, how about you try not to have an insurance or a license, and when the cop's taking you to jail, go, hey, well, what about him?
[02:36:34.681 --> 02:36:37.122]  And the cop will say, they live by different rules.
[02:36:37.182 --> 02:36:38.103]  The police will tell you.
[02:36:38.443 --> 02:36:40.184]  The illegals aren't just left alone.
[02:36:40.811 --> 02:36:45.652]  He's got his national Mexican ID card, so he can, he can, uh, he's got carte blanche!
[02:36:46.492 --> 02:36:52.154]  That's some of the problems that we face, that we the people have to change, and you've got to do that on a local level.
[02:36:54.034 --> 02:37:03.456]  I have nothing against this individual himself, but he's part of a government, our government, the Mexican government, that openly want to destroy this country, official government documents, even Lou Dobbs, folks!
[02:37:03.816 --> 02:37:06.717]  This is the plan, so you need to call the INS on him.
[02:37:07.575 --> 02:37:10.957]  It's already been done, and the problem is, nobody does anything.
[02:37:10.977 --> 02:37:22.845]  The guy's been here for a year and a half now, with his family, and he says, I'm gonna pay $2,500 to get my brother brought in, and I'm just like, oh my God, why would anybody do that?
[02:37:22.885 --> 02:37:24.266]  The police won't do anything!
[02:37:24.586 --> 02:37:26.667]  So he's gonna pay a coyote, a criminal.
[02:37:26.687 --> 02:37:35.713]  He's gonna pay a coyote to bring, and it's funny, I'm sitting here holding to talk to you, and here comes the guy around the corner, and he's got three guys that I've never seen.
[02:37:35.793 --> 02:37:36.674]  Are you on a short phone?
[02:37:37.372 --> 02:37:37.772]  Yes, I am.
[02:37:37.972 --> 02:37:38.792]  Well, walk up to him.
[02:37:39.613 --> 02:37:40.813]  Well, actually, they've already left.
[02:37:41.213 --> 02:37:42.653]  Okay, well, he's driving around the corner.
[02:37:42.813 --> 02:37:43.173]  Too bad.
[02:37:43.213 --> 02:37:44.674]  I'd like to talk to him.
[02:37:45.094 --> 02:37:46.754]  Yeah, well, I know right where he lives.
[02:37:46.934 --> 02:37:48.655]  I know his name.
[02:37:49.415 --> 02:37:51.235]  Well, what you ought to do... Let's not give his name out.
[02:37:51.255 --> 02:37:52.495]  What you ought to do... No, no.
[02:37:52.695 --> 02:37:56.976]  You need to call the police and say, look, there's a crime being committed right there.
[02:37:57.036 --> 02:37:58.097]  I demand you do something.
[02:37:58.537 --> 02:37:59.197]  It's already been done.
[02:38:00.633 --> 02:38:01.954]  They refuse to respond.
[02:38:02.294 --> 02:38:08.237]  And what can you do when the state, local, and federals refuse to uphold the law?
[02:38:08.337 --> 02:38:10.337]  But see how it's all selectively enforced?
[02:38:10.397 --> 02:38:11.838]  We're the fat, dumb Americans.
[02:38:11.878 --> 02:38:14.019]  We're the easy mark.
[02:38:14.039 --> 02:38:15.019]  We're here to be fed on.
[02:38:15.059 --> 02:38:15.680]  Thanks for the call.
[02:38:16.320 --> 02:38:17.881]  I know, it's frustrating.
[02:38:18.161 --> 02:38:20.582]  Before I run out of time, let's play the Olbert clip.
[02:38:20.602 --> 02:38:27.825]  This is the Israeli Prime Minister yesterday giving a speech being praised by Congress for the need to attack Iran.
[02:38:27.845 --> 02:38:29.686]  We're going to roll about a minute, 20 of this.
[02:38:33.197 --> 02:38:38.598]  It is three years since the Roadmap for Peace was presented.
[02:38:39.679 --> 02:38:43.820]  The Roadmap was, and remains, the right plan.
[02:38:43.840 --> 02:38:53.622]  A Palestinian leadership that fulfills its commitments and obligations will find us a willing partner in peace.
[02:38:56.023 --> 02:39:01.204]  But if they refuse, we will not give a terrorist regime
[02:39:02.256 --> 02:39:07.640]  A veto over progress or allow it to take Hope hostage.
[02:39:14.664 --> 02:39:18.286]  We cannot wait for the Palestinians forever.
[02:39:20.268 --> 02:39:24.370]  Our deepest wish is to build a better future for our region.
[02:39:25.431 --> 02:39:28.873]  Hand in hand with a Palestinian partner.
[02:39:30.834 --> 02:39:31.415]  But if not,
[02:39:33.228 --> 02:39:36.509]  We will move forward, but not alone.
[02:39:38.830 --> 02:39:45.533]  We could never have implemented the disengagement plan without your firm support.
[02:39:52.355 --> 02:40:00.258]  And then I've got the transcript of more of what he had to say about how we've got to attack Iran, if Europe won't help us we've got to do it, or Israel will do it alone.
[02:40:01.289 --> 02:40:02.190]  Very, very serious.
[02:40:02.430 --> 02:40:05.252]  And before we take more calls, I'm going to play this little propaganda piece.
[02:40:06.593 --> 02:40:13.658]  This is a piece that came out, I guess, a few years ago for the troops.
[02:40:13.738 --> 02:40:15.039]  And again, I support the troops.
[02:40:15.059 --> 02:40:18.821]  That means I don't want them breathing depleted uranium, which admittedly is killing them.
[02:40:19.542 --> 02:40:23.725]  I don't like the fact that the troops get charged for their own body armor when it gets blown off their body.
[02:40:24.285 --> 02:40:29.889]  I don't like the fact they were lied to and told they'd be home in time for Christmas, and many of them have served three, four tours over there.
[02:40:30.467 --> 02:40:35.208]  I don't like the fact that when their arms and legs are blown off, they've got to pay $4 a day in the hospital for their meals.
[02:40:35.668 --> 02:40:38.289]  I don't like the fact that they have to pay for their own flights back to the U.S.
[02:40:38.629 --> 02:40:45.251]  I don't like the fact that they've served two, three, four tours, and they've been automatically brought in with stop-loss and basically drafted.
[02:40:45.491 --> 02:40:52.053]  They've already served, and it's a draft on those that volunteered for two, three years, and they say, no, no, no, you can't leave, you've got to stay.
[02:40:52.927 --> 02:40:55.089]  That is a draft of those that have already served.
[02:40:55.109 --> 02:40:56.189]  So I support the troops.
[02:40:56.690 --> 02:41:01.253]  And I don't support this phony, fraudulent war in Iraq, premeditatedly based on a fraud.
[02:41:02.054 --> 02:41:03.315]  Now listen to this country song.
[02:41:04.095 --> 02:41:06.177]  I forget the name of the artist, but it's Thanks to You.
[02:41:06.317 --> 02:41:07.838]  I heard this the other day on XM Radio.
[02:41:08.678 --> 02:41:13.842]  And it's just, you can tell this singer, even like Charlie Daniels, another guy, you can tell they mean well.
[02:41:13.862 --> 02:41:15.023]  They think they're good guys.
[02:41:15.503 --> 02:41:16.864]  Oh, you're fighting for freedom.
[02:41:17.064 --> 02:41:18.605]  Oh, without you, what will we do?
[02:41:19.975 --> 02:41:23.656]  The very government waging war in Iraq is destroying our freedoms here!
[02:41:24.236 --> 02:41:25.316]  You can't debate that!
[02:41:26.076 --> 02:41:27.716]  So go ahead and roll that song.
[02:41:27.916 --> 02:41:28.777]  You have it, don't you, Scott?
[02:41:30.517 --> 02:41:32.397]  Now go ahead and we're going to roll just part of this.
[02:41:32.517 --> 02:41:32.917]  Go ahead.
[02:41:43.879 --> 02:41:46.740]  We don't think about that much
[02:41:47.463 --> 02:42:11.481]  Till we send them off to war That's when we get behind them To show them our support But we sometimes take for granted That they'll always be around Each one of them a hero For defending this sacred ground
[02:42:12.728 --> 02:42:15.809]  They keep us safe and they keep us free.
[02:42:16.349 --> 02:42:18.550]  They make this country proud.
[02:42:19.791 --> 02:42:22.332]  One American to another.
[02:42:23.112 --> 02:42:25.833]  It's time they heard these words out loud.
[02:42:26.513 --> 02:42:32.836]  Thank you for the job you do so well.
[02:42:34.262 --> 02:42:37.243]  You risk it all in freedom's name.
[02:42:37.263 --> 02:42:40.064]  And sometimes go through hell.
[02:42:40.724 --> 02:42:42.985]  Thank you.
[02:42:43.445 --> 02:42:46.667]  For the sacrifices made.
[02:42:46.727 --> 02:42:51.789]  For the ones who never came back home.
[02:42:52.109 --> 02:42:54.350]  The highest price was paid.
[02:42:55.990 --> 02:42:59.832]  It's about time we show some gratitude.
[02:43:02.484 --> 02:43:11.570]  Let me be the first in line to say thank you.
[02:43:11.710 --> 02:43:22.738]  I want to thank those men and women inside the Legion Hall tonight.
[02:43:24.179 --> 02:43:30.283]  They were willing to do whatever it took, even laying down their lives.
[02:43:31.441 --> 02:43:42.076]  Oh man, didn't she end up in the air a tough job day in and day out That's what being an American soldier is all about
[02:43:47.293 --> 02:43:52.434]  Thank you for the job you do so well.
[02:43:53.074 --> 02:43:56.375]  You risk it all in freedom's name.
[02:43:56.655 --> 02:43:58.796]  And sometimes go through hell.
[02:43:59.576 --> 02:44:06.077]  Thank you for the sacrifices made.
[02:44:07.177 --> 02:44:10.578]  For the ones who never came back home.
[02:44:10.958 --> 02:44:13.199]  The highest price was paid.
[02:44:14.793 --> 02:44:21.177]  Hey, how about you just not give the troops words?
[02:44:34.153 --> 02:44:39.441]  How about you allow their families to ship them real body armor and not the defective level 2 that's getting them all killed?
[02:44:39.721 --> 02:44:46.030]  How about you just not say thank you, 70 plus percent want to come home and say the whole war is a fraud?
[02:44:46.869 --> 02:44:48.010]  And they've been lied to.
[02:44:48.110 --> 02:44:52.813]  Imagine you serve two, three tours, and they say, sorry, your contract said this, but we're going to keep you there.
[02:44:53.174 --> 02:44:56.396]  I mean, how about you do what the troops really want if you want to say thank you?
[02:44:56.456 --> 02:45:00.319]  No, it's easy to make ten million dollars off some song, off some album.
[02:45:00.619 --> 02:45:02.801]  I was trying to listen to country music on XM Radio.
[02:45:02.821 --> 02:45:04.062]  They had like ten channels of it.
[02:45:04.582 --> 02:45:09.566]  And driving to the office, and driving back, and probably an hour of listening to it, half the songs were like this.
[02:45:10.166 --> 02:45:10.906]  Different channels.
[02:45:10.947 --> 02:45:11.707]  I was flipping around.
[02:45:11.747 --> 02:45:14.708]  It was just all, Marley, you're so good!
[02:45:14.828 --> 02:45:16.589]  Fighting them Al-Qaedas!
[02:45:17.090 --> 02:45:18.510]  Oh, we love you!
[02:45:18.530 --> 02:45:20.551]  I mean, it's just a lie!
[02:45:20.571 --> 02:45:25.154]  What would Johnny Cash be saying about all this if he was still alive?
[02:45:25.194 --> 02:45:26.314]  He'd know it was a fraud.
[02:45:27.095 --> 02:45:28.175]  It's a fraud!
[02:45:29.296 --> 02:45:31.277]  And there's people who want to be sappy.
[02:45:31.317 --> 02:45:32.257]  They want to be kind.
[02:45:32.557 --> 02:45:34.798]  You want to just... I know you guys aren't bad out there.
[02:45:35.098 --> 02:45:37.980]  You want to just feel good and have American flags all over your car.
[02:45:39.268 --> 02:45:41.811]  That artist talks about sacred ground.
[02:45:42.091 --> 02:45:48.818]  Our sacred ground, it is public that our government has implemented legislation for the American Union.
[02:45:49.178 --> 02:45:51.000]  Again, even Lou Dobbs has read the document.
[02:45:51.280 --> 02:45:53.923]  It's happening, the end of America, you twits!
[02:45:56.165 --> 02:45:57.806]  I'm upset, I love this country.
[02:45:59.188 --> 02:46:03.412]  If our military was down there fighting the Mexican troops that are attacking us, I would be saying thanks to you.
[02:46:04.269 --> 02:46:07.272]  And I'd do more than pay them lip service, I'd make sure they had real body armor.
[02:46:07.572 --> 02:46:15.039]  But over in some innocent country, who was our ally, who we set up to attack Iran, who we set up to attack Kuwait, and don't give me that!
[02:46:15.179 --> 02:46:16.901]  What I just said's the truth, okay?
[02:46:17.081 --> 02:46:18.422]  What I just said's the facts!
[02:46:21.045 --> 02:46:22.947]  Patriotism isn't being an idiot.
[02:46:23.968 --> 02:46:26.370]  Patriotism isn't being sappy and tearing up.
[02:46:28.007 --> 02:46:33.191]  Patriotism is defending our borders when a bunch of foreigners are taking American flags down and burning them.
[02:46:33.231 --> 02:46:37.573]  Yes, I got video off Spanish TV of them burning American flags coast-to-coast.
[02:46:37.593 --> 02:46:39.014]  It was never on CNN.
[02:46:40.495 --> 02:46:42.297]  And George Bush is behind all of it.
[02:46:42.317 --> 02:46:44.598]  The people that control Bush are behind all of it.
[02:46:45.959 --> 02:46:47.920]  He's double the size of the BATF.
[02:46:47.940 --> 02:46:51.963]  Do you love your Second Amendment that our veterans did fight and die for over 230 years ago?
[02:46:54.571 --> 02:47:00.975]  Or do you love being a sap and sticking yellow ribbons all over your car that means you support the killing of our troops?
[02:47:01.176 --> 02:47:04.518]  That means you support the lie and the fraud and the scam?
[02:47:08.020 --> 02:47:10.182]  Now listen, this story didn't get enough traction.
[02:47:10.922 --> 02:47:12.163]  It's already on yesterday's news.
[02:47:12.183 --> 02:47:13.204]  You've got to click on the archive.
[02:47:13.224 --> 02:47:13.924]  It's a top story.
[02:47:13.944 --> 02:47:15.746]  We're going to make sure it stays on the main page.
[02:47:15.766 --> 02:47:16.686]  We're putting it back up there.
[02:47:17.227 --> 02:47:19.928]  Paul Watson spent hours and hours writing this.
[02:47:19.988 --> 02:47:20.909]  It's full of documents.
[02:47:21.009 --> 02:47:22.030]  All the claims are proven.
[02:47:23.547 --> 02:47:26.249]  Our military is being trained to take our guns and put us in camps.
[02:47:26.529 --> 02:47:26.869]  Period.
[02:47:27.669 --> 02:47:39.036]  Secret FEMA plan to use pastors as pacifiers in preparation for martial law nationwide initiative trains volunteers to teach congregations to obey the government during seizure of guns, property, forced inoculations, and forced relocation.
[02:47:39.376 --> 02:47:40.777]  And we have the training manual.
[02:47:41.217 --> 02:47:42.298]  We have them all posted.
[02:47:42.398 --> 02:47:43.398]  All the claims are proven.
[02:47:43.758 --> 02:47:48.421]  Gun rights activists, property rights activists, Christians, homeschoolers, you're all listed.
[02:47:49.082 --> 02:47:51.904]  Thanks to you, America's dead.
[02:47:52.124 --> 02:47:54.685]  Thanks to you, it's all over.
[02:47:54.705 --> 02:47:55.706]  Come on!
[02:47:57.247 --> 02:48:02.289]  And most of these phony country people have never been on a... never been on a horse, never worked on a ranch.
[02:48:02.369 --> 02:48:06.652]  All that Nashville fake sell make me sick with their fake music.
[02:48:09.366 --> 02:48:11.808]  It's like everything else is as fake as a $3 bill.
[02:48:11.828 --> 02:48:13.148]  Your patriotism is fake.
[02:48:13.369 --> 02:48:14.749]  Your cowboy boots are fake.
[02:48:14.990 --> 02:48:16.711]  Your cowboy hats are fake.
[02:48:16.911 --> 02:48:18.392]  Your belt buckles are a joke.
[02:48:18.592 --> 02:48:19.593]  You're a bunch of idiots.
[02:48:22.034 --> 02:48:23.355]  I am sick of the scams.
[02:48:24.275 --> 02:48:31.160]  And I'm sick of a bunch of rich people sitting around selling patriotic songs, making millions of dollars, selling a fraud.
[02:48:34.762 --> 02:48:36.423]  And I'm sure a lot of these idiots mean well.
[02:48:36.643 --> 02:48:37.804]  I just, it's unbelievable.
[02:48:38.621 --> 02:48:40.830]  I got the report right here what they're doing to our churches.
[02:48:40.850 --> 02:48:42.316]  We need to get this out to everybody.
[02:48:42.497 --> 02:48:44.284]  This isn't America when they do this stuff!
[02:48:47.361 --> 02:48:50.204]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[02:48:50.484 --> 02:48:52.046]  Hello, my friends, Alex Jones here.

[02:48:57.411 --> 02:49:01.835]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy.
[02:49:02.255 --> 02:49:06.460]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[02:49:06.680 --> 02:49:09.522]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[02:49:09.603 --> 02:49:12.105]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks,
[02:49:12.285 --> 02:49:18.847]  With the roots and history of its orchestrators, Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[02:49:19.088 --> 02:49:26.330]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that is sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.

[02:51:49.136 --> 02:51:54.019]  Ray McGovern coming to our big 9-11 conference in Los Angeles 24th and 25th of June.
[02:51:54.039 --> 02:51:55.039]  Get your tickets now.
[02:51:55.059 --> 02:51:56.700]  It's going to be once in a lifetime.
[02:51:57.220 --> 02:51:59.061]  Let's ram through four calls quickly.
[02:51:59.081 --> 02:51:59.782]  I'm going to move fast.
[02:52:00.162 --> 02:52:01.703]  Osa in Texas, you're on the air.
[02:52:01.783 --> 02:52:02.223]  Go ahead.
[02:52:02.683 --> 02:52:07.746]  Hey Alex Jones, basically I want to talk about this program from Prison Planet that I saw on May 10th.
[02:52:07.766 --> 02:52:13.689]  It was probably one of the most amusing and the funniest broadcasts I've seen, but at the same time it wasn't that funny.
[02:52:14.109 --> 02:52:17.991]  And basically to make a long story short, you're talking about the dumbing down of our society
[02:52:18.893 --> 02:52:29.641]  Because of the media, because of the latest fashion fad, because of that fact, people just don't seem to care about what's really going on.
[02:52:29.941 --> 02:52:30.602]  What did you see?
[02:52:30.662 --> 02:52:31.322]  I don't remember it.
[02:52:32.403 --> 02:52:44.112]  Basically, you were talking about how our society is being dumbed down because of, you know, what's... Basically, you mentioned that people don't care.
[02:52:44.696 --> 02:52:49.037]  About what's going on, about the facts that people can't name Iraq or Iran on a map.
[02:52:49.337 --> 02:52:51.578]  Oh yeah, that was the big national study, yeah.
[02:52:52.058 --> 02:52:53.718]  Yeah, and it's a shame.
[02:52:53.778 --> 02:52:58.660]  You try to tell people that, hey, our media's being run by the Rockefellers, the Rothschilds.
[02:52:58.680 --> 02:53:01.701]  You tell them all these things, that the war on terror is fraud.
[02:53:02.081 --> 02:53:04.521]  You try to tell them it's like talking to a brick wall, Alex.
[02:53:05.522 --> 02:53:08.582]  Some people, Osen, I appreciate your call, I understand your frustration.
[02:53:08.642 --> 02:53:09.843]  A lot are waking up.
[02:53:10.123 --> 02:53:11.403]  Remember, the idiots don't count.
[02:53:11.423 --> 02:53:13.324]  They're going to drool in a corner no matter what we do.
[02:53:14.733 --> 02:53:15.113]  Who hung up?
[02:53:15.133 --> 02:53:17.215]  I was going to you, Dave.
[02:53:17.535 --> 02:53:18.275]  Dave in Canada.
[02:53:18.616 --> 02:53:19.976]  Jack in Arizona.
[02:53:19.996 --> 02:53:20.597]  Go ahead, Jack.
[02:53:21.497 --> 02:53:22.438]  Alex, good to talk to you.
[02:53:22.538 --> 02:53:23.219]  I'll make it quick.
[02:53:24.219 --> 02:53:30.423]  Yesterday you had a really great guest on, on the whole Nazi thing and the connection with American big business.
[02:53:30.924 --> 02:53:32.004]  Yeah, the Nazi Hydra.
[02:53:32.384 --> 02:53:40.770]  And my shortwave reception here in Arizona kept going in and out, and I really missed the, I think his name was Glenn Yadin?
[02:53:41.789 --> 02:53:43.270]  But I missed the title of the book.
[02:53:43.490 --> 02:53:44.891]  Nazi Hydra in America.
[02:53:44.911 --> 02:53:47.093]  If you can get to a computer, it was in yesterday's news.
[02:53:47.393 --> 02:53:48.814]  Nazi Hydra in America?
[02:53:49.014 --> 02:53:49.274]  Yes.
[02:53:49.415 --> 02:53:50.635]  And how do you spell his last name?
[02:53:52.457 --> 02:53:54.138]  Uh... Yadin.
[02:53:54.518 --> 02:53:58.341]  Y-E-A-D... I can't spell it out live on air.
[02:53:58.361 --> 02:53:59.062]  I have to write it down.
[02:53:59.122 --> 02:53:59.502]  Yadin.
[02:53:59.562 --> 02:54:02.364]  Y-E-A-D-E-N.
[02:54:02.624 --> 02:54:02.944]  There you go.
[02:54:03.144 --> 02:54:04.045]  Y-E-A-D-E-N.
[02:54:04.285 --> 02:54:05.326]  Will you be carrying the book?
[02:54:05.866 --> 02:54:06.527]  I may be, yes sir.
[02:54:07.461 --> 02:54:12.229]  Because his information was extremely revealing, especially the Bush connection.
[02:54:12.289 --> 02:54:13.891]  Well, I've got all the original news articles.
[02:54:13.951 --> 02:54:14.512]  It's all admitted.
[02:54:14.552 --> 02:54:15.654]  He just put it together nicely.
[02:54:16.306 --> 02:54:23.248]  It's unbelievable that this truth is out there, and people seem to be letting it go in one ear and out the other.
[02:54:23.348 --> 02:54:23.889]  That's the thing!
[02:54:23.949 --> 02:54:25.069]  The truth is so weird!
[02:54:25.109 --> 02:54:33.872]  George Bush has hired the Mexicans through a PR firm to bully Americans into accepting total amnesty, and the media is saying it's getting tough when it's amnesty!
[02:54:34.092 --> 02:54:34.792]  Thanks for the call!
[02:54:34.892 --> 02:54:35.793]  Everything's insane!
[02:54:36.013 --> 02:54:37.173]  The Bushes are Nazis?
[02:54:37.213 --> 02:54:38.754]  I mean, they got Nazi money still?
[02:54:38.774 --> 02:54:40.874]  I mean, it's all just Twilight Zone.
[02:54:41.254 --> 02:54:45.036]  Dave hung up, so we'll go to Mike in Illinois, I believe.
[02:54:45.116 --> 02:54:45.696]  Mike, go ahead.
[02:54:46.136 --> 02:54:47.117]  Yeah, Mike in Louisiana.
[02:54:47.377 --> 02:54:48.178]  Okay, go ahead, sir.
[02:54:48.198 --> 02:54:48.598]  No problem.
[02:54:48.779 --> 02:54:53.403]  I've been emailing back and forth with a friend of mine, trying to wake him up over the last few days.
[02:54:53.803 --> 02:54:59.248]  I mean, talking hundreds of emails, you know, just trying to wake him up to the whole idea of this conspiracy.
[02:54:59.268 --> 02:55:04.132]  And then, of course, the culmination is 9-1-1 and the event with World Trade Center 1-2.
[02:55:04.172 --> 02:55:06.714]  And, of course, I was hanging my hat on World Trade Center 7.
[02:55:07.315 --> 02:55:09.717]  He's been bringing up the debunking sites, you know.
[02:55:10.290 --> 02:55:13.992]  And I'm looking at the layout, and you've got World Trade Center 3, 4, 5, and 6.
[02:55:14.072 --> 02:55:16.553]  The debris had to jump over 6 to get to 7.
[02:55:16.813 --> 02:55:19.435]  We have the official debris fields.
[02:55:19.495 --> 02:55:20.835]  It only got hit by dust.
[02:55:21.275 --> 02:55:22.596]  The building was not damaged.
[02:55:22.876 --> 02:55:24.937]  FEMA says they don't know why it fell.
[02:55:24.957 --> 02:55:27.859]  They've given five different fraud reasons and had to retract them.
[02:55:28.099 --> 02:55:29.640]  The underwriters have said it's a fraud.
[02:55:29.660 --> 02:55:30.540]  There had to be bombs.
[02:55:30.880 --> 02:55:34.342]  And then what the debunking sites that I've looked at do, they just lie, sir.
[02:55:34.722 --> 02:55:38.585]  Yeah, and that's what, you know, he's going to then say, well, you know, well, you know, they're lying.
[02:55:38.625 --> 02:55:40.586]  You say, you know, I say your guys are lying.
[02:55:40.626 --> 02:55:42.428]  And then where does it go from there?
[02:55:42.488 --> 02:55:44.409]  You know, I mean, he's this, this, this site.
[02:55:44.469 --> 02:55:47.792]  They have the urban legend site saying China doesn't sell organs.
[02:55:48.372 --> 02:55:48.712]  Okay.
[02:55:49.173 --> 02:55:54.056]  I mean, there are debunking sites that say Rumsfeld never said there were WMDs.
[02:55:54.637 --> 02:55:56.618]  I mean, these people are just jokes.
[02:55:58.917 --> 02:56:04.878]  All right, well, yeah, they addressed Larry Silverstein saying pull, meaning it meant to take the fireman out of the thing and not pull the building.
[02:56:04.898 --> 02:56:07.319]  Yeah, but the firemen were already out of that when he gave that order.
[02:56:07.519 --> 02:56:08.719]  They were told to get out of the building.
[02:56:08.779 --> 02:56:11.020]  Pull is the industry term for demolition.
[02:56:12.020 --> 02:56:14.221]  Oh, yeah, I guess people are going to believe what they want to believe, you know?
[02:56:14.401 --> 02:56:15.021]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:56:15.061 --> 02:56:19.062]  When they take your pension funds and devalue the dollar more, they can just jump around saying it's wonderful.
[02:56:19.602 --> 02:56:21.142]  I mean, you know, you can believe whatever you want.
[02:56:21.202 --> 02:56:22.223]  You can believe in the tooth fairy.
[02:56:22.523 --> 02:56:23.463]  God bless you all.
