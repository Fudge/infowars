[00:00:05.896 --> 00:00:06.536]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.217 --> 00:00:08.258]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.979 --> 00:00:10.081]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.741 --> 00:00:11.542]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.303 --> 00:00:13.204]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.224 --> 00:00:17.649]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:22.135]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:24.568 --> 00:00:32.678]  Live from Austin, Texas, deep behind enemy lines, you are listening to the Alex Jones Show GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:32.718 --> 00:00:35.321]  It is the 18th day of July, 2006.
[00:00:35.361 --> 00:00:41.509]  I am your narrator and radio gun, Jack Blood, filling in for Alex Jones today.
[00:00:41.909 --> 00:00:42.851]  Alex will be back.
[00:00:43.351 --> 00:00:49.433]  With renewed vigor, with white knuckles and the hair standing up on the back of his neck on tomorrow's broadcast.
[00:00:49.793 --> 00:00:51.853]  I have been filling in for Alex here these last few days.
[00:00:51.873 --> 00:00:53.894]  Thank you so much for tuning in today.
[00:00:54.274 --> 00:00:58.175]  We have a very, very interesting show for you coming up in the second hour.
[00:00:58.595 --> 00:01:03.716]  Yonatan Shapira was a captain in the Israeli Air Force Reserves.
[00:01:04.336 --> 00:01:06.837]  He is also a military refuser.
[00:01:07.117 --> 00:01:08.678]  Yonatan joined the ITF in 1991.
[00:01:08.738 --> 00:01:12.319]  He graduated from the Israeli Air Force Flight Course in 1993.
[00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.681]  He served as a regular in the Air Force until 1999.
[00:01:17.221 --> 00:01:25.925]  And while a regular, Yonatan flew primarily as a rescue and assault helicopter pilot, completing well over 100 missions, including missions in Lebanon.
[00:01:26.645 --> 00:01:43.576]  And in 2003, Yonatan Shapira, along with 26 others, signed a declaration refusing to participate in aerial attacks on populated areas in the Palestine territories because of the belief that these attacks are illegal, immoral, and do not serve the security of Israel.
[00:01:44.531 --> 00:01:52.394]  Jonathan Shapira, a refusenik, a military refuser, joining us in the second hour of today's show, the Alex Jones Show.
[00:01:52.754 --> 00:01:53.935]  We have a lot of news to cover.
[00:01:53.955 --> 00:01:56.316]  We're going to continue to cover news in the Middle East.
[00:01:56.796 --> 00:02:03.179]  On yesterday's program, we talked very briefly, well, extensively, rather, with Webster Tarpley.
[00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.000]  We did talk quite a bit about
[00:02:06.718 --> 00:02:11.861]  The 25,000 American citizens stuck right now in Lebanon and Beirut.
[00:02:11.881 --> 00:02:13.642]  And what is going to be done with those people?
[00:02:13.662 --> 00:02:16.083]  Well, yesterday, of course, that was most of the news.
[00:02:16.423 --> 00:02:24.308]  In fact, a number of cable news networks did get through to several people still on the ground in Lebanon who are saying,
[00:02:25.083 --> 00:02:33.547]  Over the airwaves, that they are being attacked relentlessly, that the Israelis are bombing everything in sight, and there is no safe place to hide.
[00:02:33.647 --> 00:02:34.707]  So there you go, folks.
[00:02:35.348 --> 00:02:37.789]  Our president, our great country...
[00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:42.963]  Not able to pull back the leash on Israel.
[00:02:43.043 --> 00:02:46.365]  And I want to make something very clear as we run through this information today.
[00:02:46.786 --> 00:02:53.572]  As we talk about Israel, we only talk about the upper echelons of the evil government of Israel.
[00:02:53.652 --> 00:03:01.899]  Just like we talk about the upper echelons of the evil government of this country, or of the United Kingdom, or of France, or Germany, or Russia, or China.
[00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:02.780]  What have you?
[00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:05.882]  They are absolutely no different than the rest of us.
[00:03:05.922 --> 00:03:13.248]  They have evil leadership who will seek to blow up the entire world if they are left absolutely unmolested.
[00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:15.230]  So I want to make that very clear.
[00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:26.279]  And I gotta tell you folks, I was very surprised yesterday as we were talking and hearing a lot of people up to speed on the powers that be, up to speed on the workings of the globalists and the New World Order.
[00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:33.807]  Totally up to speed on 9-11, looking to defend Israel for some spiritual reason.
[00:03:33.888 --> 00:03:34.628]  Look, folks!
[00:03:35.429 --> 00:03:36.931]  What would Jesus do?
[00:03:37.071 --> 00:03:38.633]  What would Buddha do?
[00:03:39.582 --> 00:03:40.362]  Name your God!
[00:03:40.442 --> 00:03:41.683]  What would Allah do?
[00:03:42.043 --> 00:03:48.465]  Would Allah bomb innocent children in a war of aggression over a few kidnappings?
[00:03:48.485 --> 00:03:52.086]  This has completely gotten out of hand and therefore I believe we need to talk about it.
[00:03:52.106 --> 00:03:57.448]  We will be updating you throughout the program with various developments and we're going to be covering a lot of news.
[00:03:57.468 --> 00:04:03.630]  It's just come out here that hospital staff have been charged with killing patients after Katrina.
[00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:07.811]  The Attorney General holding a news conference I believe just today
[00:04:08.411 --> 00:04:09.492]  So we'll talk a little bit about that.
[00:04:09.532 --> 00:04:27.282]  In fact, we covered this during Katrina where there were a number of hospitals and old folks homes where they simply just turned out the lights on the patients, sometimes leaving them there, sometimes even euthanizing them on the ground in order to stop any potential suffering they might feel as the floods moved in.
[00:04:27.323 --> 00:04:31.205]  Well, there have been some charges involved with that and we'll go over that news today.
[00:04:32.129 --> 00:04:35.610]  A new HP wireless chip connects the digital and real world.
[00:04:35.691 --> 00:04:40.092]  Tiny chips that can be attached to objects from photos to prescription bottles.
[00:04:40.853 --> 00:04:45.054]  And George Pataki signs a new state limit on video surveillance.
[00:04:45.594 --> 00:04:48.055]  Of course this won't involve Homeland Security surveillance.
[00:04:48.376 --> 00:04:51.097]  Just the surveillance you can provide at your own business.
[00:04:51.157 --> 00:04:52.177]  Regulating your business.
[00:04:52.277 --> 00:04:53.418]  Regulating your privacy.
[00:04:53.738 --> 00:04:55.178]  That's a great country.
[00:04:55.398 --> 00:04:56.619]  We'll be right back after this folks.
[00:04:56.639 --> 00:04:56.959]  Stay tuned.
[00:04:56.979 --> 00:04:58.120]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:04:58.220 --> 00:04:58.900]  InfoWars.com.
[00:05:02.287 --> 00:05:05.230]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:07.171]  Alex Jones here, America.
[00:05:07.371 --> 00:05:13.116]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest, most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[00:05:13.397 --> 00:05:18.641]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[00:05:18.941 --> 00:05:23.045]  Brace yourselves as the new world order program for world domination has blown wide open.
[00:05:23.365 --> 00:05:27.049]  Nightmarish post-September 11th world, where the military and the police are merged.
[00:05:27.289 --> 00:05:31.934]  Witnesses populations beg for national ID cards, and yes, even implantable microchips.
[00:05:32.014 --> 00:05:38.280]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies, psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.
[00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:40.162]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.
[00:05:40.622 --> 00:05:42.723]  Order 9-1-1 The Road to Terry today.

[00:05:56.669 --> 00:05:58.210]  Order today and spread the word.
[00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:00.451]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.
[00:06:01.633 --> 00:06:12.364]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials, bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.
[00:06:12.544 --> 00:06:20.152]  The revolutionary Berkey Light, with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements, remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:06:20.392 --> 00:06:23.515]  Harmful or unwanted chemicals are reduced to below detectable levels.
[00:06:23.795 --> 00:06:29.522]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury, while leaving the nutritional minerals your body needs.
[00:06:29.823 --> 00:06:35.970]  Made of durable Lexan, the material used in making bulletproof glass, the system is durable, rugged, and yet attractive.
[00:06:36.351 --> 00:06:40.235]  The Berkey Light is transparent, so there is no guesswork when refilling the system.
[00:06:40.276 --> 00:06:42.158]  The water level is always visible.
[00:06:42.358 --> 00:06:48.281]  The rechargeable LED lighting system is beautiful as a night light and as necessary in emergency situations.

[00:07:02.907 --> 00:07:05.471]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here with an important question.
[00:07:05.631 --> 00:07:07.794]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[00:07:08.074 --> 00:07:18.087]  I mean the hard to find kind that's all natural and not full of corrosive toxins and chemicals and detergents that just dry out your skin and have been connected to very serious health problems?
[00:07:18.408 --> 00:07:20.731]  Let me tell you something about the Calbin Pure Soap Company.

[00:07:51.784 --> 00:07:59.610]  That's 1-800-340-7091 or on the web at CalbinPureSoap.com.
[00:08:02.573 --> 00:08:08.598]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:09.218 --> 00:08:12.181]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:31.374 --> 00:08:37.859]  I'm going to cover a lot of this news from the Middle East here, and just to let you know, we have a couple of clips we wanted to put on the show today.
[00:08:38.059 --> 00:08:45.805]  One, of course, James Woolsey calling for an attack on Syria on John Gibson's news program, that would be Fox News Network.
[00:08:46.146 --> 00:08:47.186]  I'm looking for that right now.
[00:08:47.567 --> 00:08:54.412]  Also, on Friday, right from this very studio, the InfoWars studio, I had an interview with Daniel Ellsberg.
[00:08:54.432 --> 00:08:56.534]  He's the man that leaked the Pentagon Papers.
[00:08:57.524 --> 00:08:59.545]  And really brought down the Nixon administration.
[00:08:59.585 --> 00:09:01.266]  Worked for the Johnson administration.
[00:09:01.346 --> 00:09:08.408]  Watched as the Gulf of Tonkin was used as a false flag operation in order as a pretext to go to war in Vietnam.
[00:09:08.769 --> 00:09:14.371]  Talked very succinctly and very openly about 9-11 in our Friday interview.
[00:09:14.391 --> 00:09:19.133]  We're going to try to play at least the 10 minutes of note during our program today.
[00:09:20.613 --> 00:09:37.635]  I just want to make sure that people understand this, and the reason why is because a lot of the refusal to understand the truth about 9-11 comes from the left, and Daniel Ellsberg, a real leader and the real hero of the left, so if we can find a few examples like him...
[00:09:38.155 --> 00:09:52.847]  Who have come out and talked openly about 9-11 and about the future of false flag terrorism and how it could be used by this Bush administration, then it might help you to convince some of your friends, family, co-workers, and people on the street who might be leaning a little more left.
[00:09:52.887 --> 00:10:06.959]  Of course, what we try to do on this program, what we try to do on this network, is to smash these paradigms, these controlled WWF paradigms of left vs. right, red state vs. blue state, demopublicans vs. republicrats,
[00:10:07.539 --> 00:10:15.382]  And I think that that, if nothing else, should be a main goal for all of us, that we can understand exactly what we're up against.
[00:10:16.322 --> 00:10:26.265]  Looking and going back to some of what we were talking about yesterday regarding these civilians who are currently being held, and let's just talk about it very
[00:10:27.236 --> 00:10:27.897]  openly here.
[00:10:27.937 --> 00:10:29.157]  Let's just be very honest.
[00:10:29.277 --> 00:10:31.199]  Let's just put our cards on the table.
[00:10:31.839 --> 00:10:53.794]  The people being held currently, and are being held in Lebanon, against their will, trying to get out of the way of these bombs, very well could end up being a shield, and as Webster Tarpley talked about yesterday, could be a cataclysm for another false flag event, either by Israel or the United States, or various roaming intelligence services.
[00:10:53.874 --> 00:10:55.275]  Of course, we remember
[00:10:56.235 --> 00:11:11.279]  Not too long ago we found SAS agents dressed as Iraqis loaded to bear with bombs and rocket-propelled grenades caught and then locked in an Iraqi jail and then later broken out in a massive military attack by the British military.
[00:11:11.339 --> 00:11:14.319]  So these are what we call P2OG.
[00:11:14.679 --> 00:11:23.361]  These are provocative counterintelligence events that of course move the agenda along for the neocons and their global controllers.
[00:11:23.722 --> 00:11:25.502]  Just to give you a little bit of history
[00:11:26.728 --> 00:11:28.368]  We'll go back to World War II.
[00:11:28.388 --> 00:11:28.769]  The U.S.
[00:11:28.829 --> 00:11:34.090]  government carried out an eight-step plan to provoke Japan into attacking and killing Americans.
[00:11:34.810 --> 00:11:37.790]  They knew in advance that Japan was going to attack.
[00:11:37.850 --> 00:11:45.612]  Now, we've talked to a lot of people inside, and they have confirmed this for us, but I think now, even on the History Channel, this is a matter of record.
[00:11:46.092 --> 00:11:46.652]  Army Board, 1944.
[00:11:47.893 --> 00:11:51.933]  Everything the Japanese were planning to do was known to the United States.
[00:11:51.953 --> 00:11:53.474]  That's from the Army Board, back in 1944.
[00:11:55.242 --> 00:11:57.604]  Flagrant absence of advanced intelligence?
[00:11:57.864 --> 00:11:58.765]  On the contrary.
[00:11:59.025 --> 00:12:08.753]  Numerous reports and warning signs all pointed towards the coming debacle and the sheer mass of transcribed radio intercepts bordering on overwhelming.
[00:12:08.773 --> 00:12:11.675]  Of course, that does sound familiar.
[00:12:11.796 --> 00:12:12.756]  Sounds a lot like 9-11.
[00:12:13.097 --> 00:12:15.058]  Sounds a lot like the 7-7 bombings.
[00:12:15.078 --> 00:12:22.104]  Sounds a lot like the 3-11 bombings in Madrid and even, dare I say, the 7-11 bombings in India recently.
[00:12:23.228 --> 00:12:28.053]  Do Freedom of Information Act files prove FDR had foreknowledge of Pearl Harbor?
[00:12:28.153 --> 00:12:33.358]  Pearl Harbor it might have been avoided when pieced together with the benefit of hindsight.
[00:12:33.398 --> 00:12:37.983]  We now see that there were many intelligence fragments that pointed to Japanese plans to attack
[00:12:38.343 --> 00:12:56.743]  Pearl Harbor, including massive intelligence, including radios that were catching shortwave radios and general radios that were catching the Japanese coming all throughout the West Coast, including a submarine in advance being sunk to the offensive.
[00:12:58.256 --> 00:12:59.737]  All right, we don't need to build the case.
[00:12:59.777 --> 00:13:01.318]  I think many of you are with me on this.
[00:13:01.398 --> 00:13:07.584]  Roosevelt left Americans in the Philippines for good war propaganda knowing that they would be killed.
[00:13:07.964 --> 00:13:11.407]  Now we're starting to see the correlations to what's going on currently in Lebanon.
[00:13:11.888 --> 00:13:12.128]  U.S.
[00:13:12.168 --> 00:13:15.571]  prisoners claim Roosevelt left them in the Philippines deliberately
[00:13:16.011 --> 00:13:17.352]  Hundreds of former U.S.
[00:13:17.412 --> 00:13:30.223]  prisoners of war have begun a battle for compensation after uncovering documents that allegedly prove the wartime administration deliberately used them as a tool to whip up domestic support for war with Japan.
[00:13:30.463 --> 00:13:35.588]  This has been going on for decades, if not centuries, if not millennia.
[00:13:35.848 --> 00:13:37.990]  This is a standard in practice, which is why
[00:13:38.570 --> 00:13:47.017]  Of course, Webster Tarpley is using this past information, using history, to put together his analysis, which, at this point, it's hard to disagree with.
[00:13:47.057 --> 00:13:54.123]  Now, I understand the logistical nightmare of trying to move 25,000 people out of a war area.
[00:13:54.204 --> 00:14:00.189]  It's difficult, if not impossible, and that's why cruise ships and the USS Iwo Jima
[00:14:00.989 --> 00:14:08.756]  Helicopters, everything within the disposal of the United States apparently is being used, but it is very, very slow.
[00:14:08.796 --> 00:14:23.048]  It's a very slow process, and even if a few hundred people are left and are killed by bombs, it can be used and will be used, you can count on it, as an excuse to begin further involvement into this new conflict in the Middle East.
[00:14:23.228 --> 00:14:28.773]  Meanwhile, it appears George W. Bush is not doing a lot of talking about this issue.
[00:14:29.413 --> 00:14:31.856]  Waiting for something, I don't know.
[00:14:31.956 --> 00:14:36.800]  Waiting for a more provocative circle in which to enter.
[00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:39.122]  That would be more evidence.
[00:14:39.923 --> 00:14:53.255]  That would be doctored evidence, most likely, that Syria and Iran are heavily involved in the Hezbollah movement and are actually directing the strikes and the rocket attacks and everything else from their central command.
[00:14:53.935 --> 00:14:54.996]  In Tehran.
[00:14:55.136 --> 00:14:55.437]  Okay.
[00:14:55.637 --> 00:15:06.426]  So once we uncover that document, once we're ready to go, still with our US citizens on the ground in Lebanon, in Beirut, what is to stop the killing?
[00:15:07.166 --> 00:15:11.910]  Neocons have resurrected plans for regional war in the Middle East.
[00:15:11.970 --> 00:15:13.371]  Here's a little more history for you.
[00:15:13.411 --> 00:15:22.519]  In 1996, Richard Perle, Douglas Feith, David Wormser, all later senior officials in the Bush administration, had a plan for how to destroy Hezbollah.
[00:15:23.206 --> 00:15:24.447]  Invade Iraq.
[00:15:24.467 --> 00:15:28.030]  Of course, after 9-11, that was completely possible.
[00:15:28.430 --> 00:15:39.939]  They wrote a report to the newly elected Likud government in Israel calling for, quote, a clean break with the policies of negotiating with the Palestinians and trading land for peace.
[00:15:41.221 --> 00:15:52.324]  The problem could be solved, quote, if Israel sees the strategic initiative along with the northern borders by engaging Hezbollah, Syria, and Iran as the principal agents of aggression in Lebanon.
[00:15:52.784 --> 00:15:53.424]  Sound familiar?
[00:15:54.284 --> 00:16:01.246]  The key, they said, was to, quote, focus on removing Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq, an important Israeli strategic objective in its own right.
[00:16:01.346 --> 00:16:02.126]  That's already done.
[00:16:03.528 --> 00:16:06.730]  And as a means of foiling Syria's regional ambitions.
[00:16:07.130 --> 00:16:10.671]  They called for, quote, reestablishing the principle of preemption.
[00:16:10.932 --> 00:16:13.052]  Again, we're long down this road.
[00:16:13.593 --> 00:16:23.417]  They promised that the successes of these wars could be used to launch campaigns against Iran, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt, reshaping the strategic balance of the Middle East profoundly.
[00:16:23.617 --> 00:16:26.619]  Are you listening, Saudi Arabia and Egypt?
[00:16:26.679 --> 00:16:30.741]  Because we came upon this document almost immediately after 9-11.
[00:16:32.293 --> 00:16:37.796]  And I've been talking about this really for years, that Saudi Arabia and Egypt are also targets.
[00:16:37.856 --> 00:16:42.318]  Right now, our strategic allies soon to be targets.
[00:16:42.858 --> 00:16:46.820]  I wonder if somebody in Saudi Arabia or Egypt might be monitoring this show.
[00:16:47.460 --> 00:16:54.143]  Not that I want to cause any global geopolitical conflicts on my own, but they should be aware.
[00:16:55.626 --> 00:16:56.767]  Now, with the U.S.
[00:16:56.827 --> 00:17:05.911]  bogged down in Iraq, with Bush losing control of world events, and with the threats to national security growing worse, no one could possibly still believe this plan, could they?
[00:17:07.331 --> 00:17:07.831]  Think again.
[00:17:08.972 --> 00:17:13.234]  William Kristol, editor of the Weekly Standard, is still pushing this radical version.
[00:17:13.574 --> 00:17:19.637]  He now uses the excuse of Hezbollah's terrorist attacks in what he calls Iran's proxy war.
[00:17:20.757 --> 00:17:22.858]  This is on the cover of the Weekly Standard.
[00:17:23.875 --> 00:17:25.836]  Iran's proxy war.
[00:17:26.136 --> 00:17:35.921]  Not the United States' proxy war, not the British or the United Kingdom's proxy war, not British Petroleum's proxy war, but Iran's proxy war.
[00:17:36.501 --> 00:17:41.384]  To push the United States deeper into regional war against Iran and Syria.
[00:17:42.418 --> 00:17:50.761]  Quote, this is William Crystal, we might consider countering this act of Iranian aggression with a military strike against Iranian nuclear facilities.
[00:17:51.081 --> 00:17:51.701]  Why wait?
[00:17:52.161 --> 00:17:55.063]  Does anyone think a nuclear Iran can be contained?
[00:17:55.083 --> 00:17:57.743]  I'm raising my hand here in the studio.
[00:17:59.264 --> 00:18:02.025]  That the current regime will negotiate in good faith.
[00:18:02.737 --> 00:18:05.438]  It would be easier to act sooner rather than later.
[00:18:05.558 --> 00:18:12.582]  Yes, there would be repercussions, and they would be healthy ones, showing a strong America that has rejected further appeasement.
[00:18:12.602 --> 00:18:14.362]  In other words, he's warning us.
[00:18:15.063 --> 00:18:17.684]  Yes, there will be repercussions.
[00:18:18.084 --> 00:18:19.245]  Healthy ones.
[00:18:19.305 --> 00:18:32.411]  Now, we can use a semantical dictionary to try to figure out exactly what he means by healthy, but I think that he was one of the people saying that they would throw flowers at our feet when we invaded Iraq.
[00:18:33.291 --> 00:18:43.577]  So, if they were going to throw flowers at our feet while we invaded Iraq, and we were going to have healthy repercussions while invading Iran, you can only do the math and extrapolate exactly how bad this might be.
[00:18:43.637 --> 00:18:54.283]  But, according to Bill Kristol, according to James Woolsey, according to Newt Gingrich, according to all of the screaming heads on Neocon Talk Radio, this must be done.
[00:18:54.403 --> 00:18:55.564]  This must be done immediately.
[00:18:55.904 --> 00:18:59.746]  We must take this opportunity now, while we have the window open.
[00:19:01.727 --> 00:19:12.470]  Richard Perle, sometimes known as the Prince of Darkness, had already weighed in in a June 25th Washington Post editorial decrying Bush's ignomacious retreat on Iran.
[00:19:12.530 --> 00:19:13.830]  He, too, wants war.
[00:19:13.910 --> 00:19:19.252]  Newt Gingrich on Meet the Press this Sunday said that we were already in World War III and that the U.S.
[00:19:19.272 --> 00:19:21.772]  needed to take direct action against North Korea and Iran.
[00:19:21.812 --> 00:19:27.134]  In fact, he didn't just say that on Meet the Press, he's been saying it anywhere, anytime somebody will put him on the air.
[00:19:28.061 --> 00:19:30.102]  I wonder if we can get Newt Gingrich on this show.
[00:19:30.122 --> 00:19:34.826]  He seems very anxious to talk about World War III and action against North Korea and Iran.
[00:19:35.646 --> 00:19:40.469]  Less well-known pundits have flooded cable news and talk radio this weekend, beating the war drums.
[00:19:41.990 --> 00:19:47.994]  We're going to continue with this, and by the way, I want to thank ThinkProgress.org for some of this editorial, doing some great work as well.
[00:19:48.014 --> 00:19:49.135]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:19:49.155 --> 00:19:50.796]  Jack Blood sitting in for Alex Jones.
[00:19:51.437 --> 00:19:53.038]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
[00:19:53.058 --> 00:19:55.339]  Go to Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:19:55.359 --> 00:19:57.261]  More information coming out by the second.
[00:19:57.281 --> 00:19:57.621]  Stay tuned.
[00:20:02.435 --> 00:20:08.239]  September 11, 2001 changed the world, and the world is now realizing that the official story of that infamous day just doesn't make sense.
[00:20:08.559 --> 00:20:13.602]  The overwhelming majority of Americans believe that there is a government cover-up, according to a CNN poll.
[00:20:13.622 --> 00:20:22.007]  9-11 In Plain Sight, the director's cut, is a compilation of unaltered news footage and photos from major networks and publications that raises questions that officials dare not ask, let alone answer.
[00:20:22.387 --> 00:20:30.312]  The worldwide firestorm of questions raised has forced some into a position of desperation damage control to keep this documentary from being seen or accepted by the masses.
[00:20:30.832 --> 00:20:35.493]  Why have these efforts been made to keep you from seeing this documentary and simply asking common sense questions?
[00:20:35.793 --> 00:20:36.173]  Find out.
[00:20:36.413 --> 00:20:40.754]  You must see 9-11 In Plain Sight The Director's Cut and share it with as many people as possible.
[00:20:41.094 --> 00:20:44.274]  Call 877-817-9829 to order your copy.
[00:20:44.534 --> 00:20:46.035]  That's 877-817-9829.
[00:20:47.655 --> 00:20:51.716]  Unless these questions are answered honestly, the world could be plunged into a third world war.
[00:20:52.056 --> 00:20:52.836]  Stop this madness.
[00:20:52.856 --> 00:20:56.056]  Call 877-817-9829 today and order your copy of 9-11 In Plain Sight The Director's Cut.
[00:21:01.806 --> 00:21:02.767]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[00:21:02.847 --> 00:21:07.630]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve Note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[00:21:07.810 --> 00:21:15.475]  Therefore, with catastrophic events comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[00:21:15.715 --> 00:21:21.099]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[00:21:21.299 --> 00:21:28.284]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[00:21:28.584 --> 00:21:33.906]  A current effort is underway by the Fed along with other central banks to increase liquidity for depositors.
[00:21:34.166 --> 00:21:38.888]  However, an increase in money supply without equal expansion in productivity can cause inflation.
[00:21:39.248 --> 00:21:46.831]  In order to achieve strength and stability, I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver.
[00:21:47.171 --> 00:21:53.415]  While paper investments currently have been driven by debt, gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years.
[00:21:53.735 --> 00:21:54.936]  For more information, call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:54.956 --> 00:21:55.196]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:02.614 --> 00:22:03.635]  The War on Terrorism.
[00:22:03.975 --> 00:22:06.758]  Will it be fought overseas, or will it affect us here at home?
[00:22:07.039 --> 00:22:11.183]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[00:22:11.603 --> 00:22:12.444]  So what do you do?
[00:22:12.764 --> 00:22:17.329]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[00:22:17.813 --> 00:22:19.933]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[00:22:20.434 --> 00:22:35.117]  Sheltering in Place, Surviving Acts of Terrorism from Biological, Chemical, and Radioactive Fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:22:35.157 --> 00:22:42.278]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[00:22:42.578 --> 00:22:45.739]  Get this critical video every American needs for only $29 plus shipping.
[00:22:47.419 --> 00:22:49.441]  Order by calling New Millennium today at 888-803-4438.
[00:22:49.561 --> 00:22:50.261]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:22:50.341 --> 00:22:51.983]  Or order on the web at Berkeywater.com.
[00:23:00.828 --> 00:23:07.691]  In December 2005, CNN had a special documentary about the inevitability of nuclear terrorism on American soil.
[00:23:07.951 --> 00:23:13.514]  When the mainstream media is reporting on such a perilous topic with such candor, it should be taken very seriously.
[00:23:13.834 --> 00:23:20.397]  Currently for sale by owner, the ultimate secure home is strategically located in the awesome mountains of southwest Colorado.
[00:23:20.617 --> 00:23:27.400]  This patented steel reinforced concrete earth home was built to withstand any natural or man-made disaster you can name.
[00:23:27.660 --> 00:23:36.706]  Whether that be a forest fire, an earthquake, or even a full-scale nuclear attack, the house is completely off-grid with solar electricity and an independent water supply.
[00:23:36.946 --> 00:23:40.448]  It even has a hidden fallout shelter with NBC air filtration.
[00:23:40.729 --> 00:23:44.211]  Its many self-sufficient and high security features will amaze you.
[00:23:44.531 --> 00:23:51.816]  With Nuclear World War 3 looming ever closer on the horizon, this custom survival home is turnkey ready for a new owner.
[00:23:52.176 --> 00:23:56.268]  For more information, visit www.ultimatesecurehome.com.
[00:23:56.488 --> 00:23:59.316]  That's www.ultimatesecurehome.com.
[00:24:04.580 --> 00:24:05.020]  Don't worry.
[00:24:05.540 --> 00:24:07.061]  This show is documented.
[00:24:07.561 --> 00:24:10.321]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:10.741 --> 00:24:14.242]  I fell into a burning ring of fire.
[00:24:14.682 --> 00:24:18.743]  I went down, down, down, and the flames went higher.
[00:24:19.323 --> 00:24:23.444]  And it burns, burns, burns, the ring of fire.
[00:24:23.464 --> 00:24:29.685]  A little Johnny Cash song about napalm and phosphorous material being used throughout the Middle East.
[00:24:29.765 --> 00:24:30.985]  Again, on civilians!
[00:24:31.545 --> 00:24:32.766]  That's what we're talking about.
[00:24:33.146 --> 00:24:33.986]  I am not
[00:24:34.887 --> 00:24:37.891]  And I don't think many of you would consider yourself pacifists.
[00:24:37.911 --> 00:24:38.952]  I'm not a pacifist.
[00:24:39.573 --> 00:24:49.545]  Though, I could be convinced, certainly, because it's hard to look back and find one war, one major conflict that wasn't started on a phony pretext.
[00:24:50.486 --> 00:24:54.771]  As General Smedley Butler wrote an entire book about this, war is a racket.
[00:24:55.774 --> 00:25:04.861]  Now, fine, if your military wants to blow up the other guy's military, and the other guy wants to blow up your military, and that's how you want to spend your money, I guess you can make an argument for that.
[00:25:05.482 --> 00:25:06.422]  Not a very good one.
[00:25:07.283 --> 00:25:19.032]  But the senseless killing of innocent civilians, or a lesser breed, a lesser class, because this is nothing less than a culture war going on in the Middle East, is absolutely inexcusable!
[00:25:19.072 --> 00:25:20.013]  It's unacceptable!
[00:25:22.464 --> 00:25:27.106]  I looked at some pictures today that were just mind-blowing and I put these up on my website.
[00:25:28.406 --> 00:25:30.147]  Hopefully got them up at Infowars.com.
[00:25:30.167 --> 00:25:45.574]  If you guys are listening you might want to check out these pictures because they literally have eight-year-old girls riding on the bombs leaving Israel that are going to be dropped on children across the border in Palestine and in Beirut!
[00:25:46.555 --> 00:25:48.736]  Literally autographing the bombs!
[00:25:50.359 --> 00:25:51.679]  Here's a special gift for you!
[00:25:53.260 --> 00:25:55.660]  Boom!
[00:25:56.881 --> 00:25:57.161]  Dead.
[00:25:57.681 --> 00:25:58.441]  I mean, folks.
[00:25:59.561 --> 00:26:06.083]  How far do we have to go before we can separate leftist pacifism to senseless killing?
[00:26:07.464 --> 00:26:15.226]  I gotta tell you, we were talking about the neocons resurrecting plans for regional war in the Middle East and talking about how this whole plan started in 1996.
[00:26:17.182 --> 00:26:35.272]  Yesterday, Webster Tarpley went over with us a secret meeting that had taken place in the American Enterprise Institute, where some of the key heads of both US and foreign powers got together and decided how they were going to try to move forward in this war in the Middle East, how they were going to go after Iran.
[00:26:35.972 --> 00:26:39.514]  Talking about the Richard Perle article on June 25th.
[00:26:40.715 --> 00:26:45.818]  Newt Gingrich, and that was in the Washington Post, saying, we gotta go to war.
[00:26:46.667 --> 00:26:49.909]  Newt Gingrich saying we gotta go get North Korean Iran.
[00:26:50.049 --> 00:26:54.292]  William Crystal, this is Iran's proxy war and the window is open.
[00:26:54.333 --> 00:26:55.113]  We gotta go.
[00:26:55.193 --> 00:26:55.854]  Why wait?
[00:26:56.234 --> 00:27:04.139]  There's going to be healthy repercussions but it'll show that we're strong here in America because that is what they tried to paint this country with.
[00:27:04.159 --> 00:27:04.740]  We're weak!
[00:27:05.741 --> 00:27:16.248]  They even go so far as to criticize President Bush himself calling him weak for trying to at least put out the appearances of negotiating before the preemptive strikes happened.
[00:27:20.347 --> 00:27:25.032]  Less well-known pundits have flooded cable news and talk radio all this week beating the war drums.
[00:27:25.092 --> 00:27:42.329]  Meanwhile, David Wormser is ensconced in Vice President Dick Cheney's office's neoconservative colleague Elliot Abrams, the convicted Iran contra felon who urged war with Iraq in 1998 in a letter to Bill Clinton, sits and directs Middle East policy on the National Security Council staff.
[00:27:42.941 --> 00:27:48.762]  The neoconservatives are now hoping to use the Israeli-Lebanon conflict as a trigger to launch a U.S.
[00:27:48.802 --> 00:27:50.803]  war against Syria, Iran, or both?
[00:27:51.503 --> 00:27:54.143]  This is the backdoor, this is the way around.
[00:27:54.964 --> 00:27:59.705]  As we've said, no one is going to stand for an attack on Iran.
[00:27:59.885 --> 00:28:10.247]  Any of the military generals, anyone in the Joint Chiefs of Staff, warning this administration and warning Congress about any potential strike on Iran, the military cannot withstand.
[00:28:10.287 --> 00:28:11.407]  It can't happen.
[00:28:12.094 --> 00:28:15.276]  It's not logistically even possible according to the experts.
[00:28:16.237 --> 00:28:19.539]  But let's not let the facts get in the way here.
[00:28:21.260 --> 00:28:35.789]  Because they found a way around it and once there's enough pressure that you have to go to Iran, you have to go to Syria, anyone who's not ably for the plan is unpatriotic and will be painted as such and lambasted in the media.
[00:28:36.690 --> 00:28:36.910]  Okay?
[00:28:37.893 --> 00:28:40.214]  These are profoundly dangerous policies.
[00:28:40.254 --> 00:28:49.099]  They have to be exposed and stopped before any more harm comes to the United States national security than it already has.
[00:28:49.419 --> 00:28:53.761]  If you think that terrorism is entirely phony, well wait until these people get done.
[00:28:53.781 --> 00:29:00.164]  They're going to be real terrorists running around everywhere in a massive clash of civilizations.
[00:29:01.241 --> 00:29:16.787]  And as Daniel Ellsberg said, the next strike will be our right without a doubt, and they will begin rounding up anybody that's Middle Eastern, anybody that supports anybody that could be Middle Eastern, and anybody that criticizes the Bush administration.
[00:29:16.947 --> 00:29:19.569]  Full sedition acts will be put in place.
[00:29:20.109 --> 00:29:21.789]  We will be rounded up into camps.
[00:29:22.670 --> 00:29:27.852]  Thus, we see the beginning of the end of this once great country.
[00:29:28.826 --> 00:29:34.489]  This once free and liberated country locked down in total sedition.
[00:29:34.669 --> 00:29:35.370]  We'll come right back.
[00:29:35.390 --> 00:29:36.490]  We'll play a couple of clips for you.
[00:29:36.510 --> 00:29:37.031]  Stay tuned.
[00:29:37.071 --> 00:29:37.831]  This is Jack Blood.
[00:29:37.851 --> 00:29:39.212]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:29:50.238 --> 00:29:51.139]  We're on the march.
[00:29:51.619 --> 00:29:53.240]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:56.842]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.436 --> 00:30:04.538]  Hey Bill, I'm buying lunch today.
[00:30:04.878 --> 00:30:06.899]  And check this out, I bought a new car.
[00:30:06.979 --> 00:30:12.223]  Wow John, I guess you took my advice and visited that website we were talking about over lunch last time we met.
[00:30:12.783 --> 00:30:16.926]  www.DidYouRobBillGates.com I did, and you were right.
[00:30:17.246 --> 00:30:22.149]  I learn how to make $3,000 to $9,000 each and every week, starting with my very first week.
[00:30:22.569 --> 00:30:25.031]  And it's a simple program that does all the work for you.
[00:30:25.331 --> 00:30:28.693]  I'm already up to $25,000 just going on my fifth week.
[00:30:28.933 --> 00:30:29.814]  Whoa, that's awesome!
[00:30:30.174 --> 00:30:32.555]  John, your business will keep growing as mine has.
[00:30:32.915 --> 00:30:35.156]  In fact, people are joining from all over the world.
[00:30:35.276 --> 00:30:35.937]  It's incredible!
[00:30:36.317 --> 00:30:43.800]  Everyone should go to www.DidYouRobBillGates.com and learn how this program can help them become financially independent, too.
[00:30:44.120 --> 00:30:49.042]  Thanks a million, Bill, for telling me about www.DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[00:30:49.662 --> 00:30:50.343]  Check, please!
[00:30:50.803 --> 00:30:51.703]  I got this one, Bill.
[00:30:52.103 --> 00:30:52.764]  Sure, John.
[00:30:52.924 --> 00:30:57.526]  Let's tell everyone about www.DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[00:30:57.666 --> 00:30:57.926]  Deal.

[00:31:18.901 --> 00:31:22.343]  So effective you can drink raw, untreated water from lakes, rivers, and streams.
[00:31:22.663 --> 00:31:32.007]  Unlike other sport bottles, the Sport Berkey's patented filter formulation is so powerful it removes cysts, parasites, harmful bacteria, and chemicals like herbicides and pesticides.
[00:31:32.267 --> 00:31:35.768]  It even reduces radon-222, lead, and other heavy metals.

[00:32:07.795 --> 00:32:12.456]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife Frequency technology.
[00:32:12.796 --> 00:32:20.318]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms could be destroyed using resonant frequency.
[00:32:20.778 --> 00:32:27.664]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:32:27.885 --> 00:32:29.266]  There are no side effects.
[00:32:29.586 --> 00:32:33.209]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.

[00:32:48.046 --> 00:32:48.887]  Once again, that's 866-885-6625.
[00:33:16.209 --> 00:33:17.611]  When the levee is blown, this is it.
[00:33:18.372 --> 00:33:23.379]  We're going to go to some of this Katrina news, most likely in the third hour of the program today.
[00:33:23.399 --> 00:33:25.141]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:25.582 --> 00:33:29.928]  Infowars.com, prisonplanet.com, breaking news going up as we speak.
[00:33:29.968 --> 00:33:31.350]  Make sure to check out those websites.
[00:33:31.897 --> 00:33:33.278]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:33.318 --> 00:33:40.563]  Jack Blood sitting in today for Alex Jones, who will be back on the air with you tomorrow, ready to go, ready to take on the New World Order.
[00:33:40.963 --> 00:33:44.145]  Yonatan Shapira joining us in the second hour of today's program.
[00:33:44.165 --> 00:33:47.507]  He is a captain, or was a captain, in the Israeli Air Force Reserves.
[00:33:48.087 --> 00:33:51.950]  He is also a military refuser who refused to bomb innocent civilians.
[00:33:52.410 --> 00:33:55.093]  Good for him in Lebanon and in Palestine.
[00:33:55.113 --> 00:33:57.195]  He'll be joining us in the second hour of our program today.
[00:33:57.235 --> 00:34:00.839]  I mentioned this quick interview that we did from the Infowar Studios.
[00:34:01.400 --> 00:34:04.603]  This interview was technically ready to go for the Alex Jones Show.
[00:34:04.623 --> 00:34:06.966]  We just ran out of time, so we carried it over onto my program.
[00:34:07.706 --> 00:34:08.287]  We're good to go.
[00:34:26.263 --> 00:34:32.045]  Awakening of the American people to how much they had been deceived by their own government about the war.
[00:34:32.065 --> 00:34:39.287]  This literally took down the Nixon administration almost single-handedly, and he might be one of the greatest whistleblowers of all time.
[00:34:39.907 --> 00:34:46.529]  Has been recently seen backing Cindy Sheehan and other anti-war efforts, but very, very intelligent man.
[00:34:46.569 --> 00:34:51.771]  He's been around the block several times, and his resume would take so long to read, we'd run out of time.
[00:34:52.111 --> 00:34:53.692]  Here is the pertinent clip.
[00:34:53.752 --> 00:34:56.034]  It'll run here for about 10 minutes.
[00:34:56.314 --> 00:35:06.102]  The interview that we did with Daniel Ellsberg talking about 9-11, our Reichstag here, and what is going to happen when and if we get hit again here on American soil.
[00:35:06.162 --> 00:35:07.623]  Groundbreaking stuff.
[00:35:07.643 --> 00:35:11.946]  First time Daniel Ellsberg ever opened up like this and he did it right here on InfoWars.
[00:35:12.207 --> 00:35:13.888]  Folks, go ahead and roll that if you could.
[00:35:14.628 --> 00:35:16.008]  I mean, look at the history of leaks.
[00:35:16.048 --> 00:35:17.189]  Look where we're at now.
[00:35:17.269 --> 00:35:18.909]  Everything's national security.
[00:35:18.989 --> 00:35:20.190]  Nothing's allowed to be leaked.
[00:35:20.210 --> 00:35:21.510]  Nothing's allowed to be printed.
[00:35:21.850 --> 00:35:25.591]  The White House trying to control all of the news reports around the country.
[00:35:25.631 --> 00:35:30.573]  What would happen today if somebody leaked something as big as you did back in 1971?
[00:35:30.653 --> 00:35:39.716]  Actually, if somebody took the risk, the personal risk of putting out a lot of clearly authoritative
[00:35:40.915 --> 00:35:43.599]  Real documents, as I did at that time.
[00:35:43.719 --> 00:35:44.841]  I think they would get printed.
[00:35:45.141 --> 00:35:50.428]  For one thing, you could almost certainly get them out on the internet, even if no major newspapers were.
[00:35:50.828 --> 00:35:54.313]  But I think actually we are seeing major leaks come out.
[00:35:55.595 --> 00:35:58.859]  Unfortunately, not usually accompanied by documents, and they get discounted.
[00:35:59.519 --> 00:36:01.380]  And some of them are way overdue.
[00:36:01.780 --> 00:36:02.680]  That's also a good point.
[00:36:02.700 --> 00:36:05.400]  I mean, what is the problem with people in this country today?
[00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:16.003]  I mean, some things are being leaked as we saw this banking information, the invasion of privacy, the massive databasing and cataloging of all Americans, the loss of liberties.
[00:36:16.443 --> 00:36:18.683]  Why do you think the people don't take this seriously today?
[00:36:18.723 --> 00:36:20.284]  Would they have taken it more seriously in 71?
[00:36:22.043 --> 00:36:22.603]  I don't know.
[00:36:22.703 --> 00:36:25.905]  I'm very disturbed by the reaction that you described there.
[00:36:27.085 --> 00:36:34.228]  I had to reflect, and it's not a happy reflection, that probably in any given time in any country, including this one,
[00:36:35.026 --> 00:36:40.688]  Most people don't care that much about liberties or rights or guarantees of freedom that much.
[00:36:40.708 --> 00:36:42.488]  I think that goes back to the revolution.
[00:36:43.549 --> 00:36:45.709]  One third of the people supported the revolution.
[00:36:45.789 --> 00:36:48.230]  One third supported the empire, according to John Adams.
[00:36:48.770 --> 00:36:50.071]  And another third were indifferent.
[00:36:50.091 --> 00:36:54.492]  It's probably always true that there's a minority of people who are really concerned about that.
[00:36:55.232 --> 00:37:07.264]  Unfortunately, at this very time, I don't see even a strong minority of people being very active in showing resistance and protest and outrage and really efforts to change this.
[00:37:07.284 --> 00:37:09.767]  Is real effort being put on Congress to
[00:37:11.164 --> 00:37:16.848]  To investigate this, of course it's a Republican majority, and they're going to show a great deal of resistance to it.
[00:37:17.528 --> 00:37:19.309]  But how much pressure are they actually getting?
[00:37:19.729 --> 00:37:21.631]  And on the Democrats to press more for it?
[00:37:22.271 --> 00:37:28.515]  I mean, it's as if after 9-11 especially, the country is acting like so many other countries, saying,
[00:37:28.935 --> 00:37:29.576]  We're in danger.
[00:37:29.596 --> 00:37:31.117]  We need a strong man.
[00:37:32.338 --> 00:37:33.439]  Let him free.
[00:37:33.479 --> 00:37:34.741]  Don't put him under restraint.
[00:37:35.481 --> 00:37:42.368]  And I'm afraid we're slipping in the direction of a police state without a lot of resistance, which is what happened in Germany.
[00:37:43.342 --> 00:37:46.044]  I think the correlations are exactly precise.
[00:37:46.364 --> 00:37:49.747]  You know, we talked kind of about the neocon doctrine in a way.
[00:37:49.767 --> 00:38:02.877]  I'm sure you're well aware of the Project for a New American Century, and that they had said they had laid a lot of this out, the doctrine out, of how they were going to go fight multiple wars and multiple theaters, how they were going to expand the budget of the Pentagon by doing so.
[00:38:02.917 --> 00:38:09.022]  But they also mentioned that this would take a really long time unless they had a new Pearl Harbor, and then magically we had 9-11.
[00:38:10.783 --> 00:38:32.181]  Have you had a chance to look at a lot of this information coming from America's leading scholars, physicists, engineers, etc., who have taken a look now at 9-11, and are now not only questioning what might have happened on 9-11, but really being very direct, including a number of high-level
[00:38:33.388 --> 00:38:44.413]  I have looked at a lot of that, and I'll tell you, without going into it all, which would take a lot of time, I find some of it very implausible and other parts of it quite solid.
[00:38:44.793 --> 00:38:53.817]  There's no question in my mind that there's enough evidence there to justify a very comprehensive and hard-hitting investigation of a kind that we have not seen.
[00:38:54.378 --> 00:39:01.381]  With subpoenas and general questioning of people and releasing a lot of documents, there's no question that
[00:39:04.250 --> 00:39:11.555]  Very serious questions have been raised about how much they knew beforehand and how much involvement there may have been.
[00:39:11.575 --> 00:39:13.036]  Is an administration capable
[00:39:14.438 --> 00:39:19.100]  Humanly and psychologically, of engineering such a provocation?
[00:39:19.601 --> 00:39:21.081]  Yes, I would say that.
[00:39:21.421 --> 00:39:23.482]  I worked for such an administration myself.
[00:39:25.503 --> 00:39:38.929]  President Johnson put destroyers in harm's way in the Tonkin Gulf, not only once but several times, with a lot of his people hoping that that would lead to a confrontation, and claiming that it had.
[00:39:40.369 --> 00:39:44.032]  And could have resulted in the loss of many lives in the course of it.
[00:39:44.733 --> 00:39:49.097]  What I'm saying now, by the way, though, is this, and here there is a very strong analogy.
[00:39:49.837 --> 00:40:01.688]  To this day, there is a controversy, it's gone back and forth historically, as to who caused the Reichstag fire, the burning of their parliament, the Reichstag, on February 27th, 1933.
[00:40:04.545 --> 00:40:09.610]  During at one point, the number two man in the Nazi regime said, I set that fire.
[00:40:10.031 --> 00:40:12.593]  Later, he denied that at Nuremberg.
[00:40:12.974 --> 00:40:17.398]  And I've noticed that the latest history suggests that it wasn't the Nazis.
[00:40:18.359 --> 00:40:19.100]  The point is that there's
[00:40:19.796 --> 00:40:22.198]  All this time later, there's still a controversy about that.
[00:40:22.618 --> 00:40:28.724]  But, what there's no controversy about is the use the Nazis made of it that very night and the next day.
[00:40:28.744 --> 00:40:30.005]  Key Bono, who backed it?
[00:40:30.025 --> 00:40:44.817]  On September 28th, there was a Reichstag fire decree that ended freedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom of association, all in the Weimar Constitution, and privacy of the postal system, and of communications, and of telephone.
[00:40:46.463 --> 00:40:49.884]  And adhere to it more than we knew four years ago, right after 9-11.
[00:40:50.725 --> 00:40:56.306]  If there's another 9-11 or a major war in the Middle East involving a U.S.
[00:40:56.366 --> 00:41:04.789]  attack on Iran, I have no doubt that there will be, the day after, within days, the equivalent of a right-side fire decree.
[00:41:04.849 --> 00:41:09.371]  It will involve massive detentions in this country, detention camps for Middle Easterners,
[00:41:09.984 --> 00:41:18.067]  And they're quote, sympathizers, critics of the President's policy, and essentially the wiping out of the Bill of Rights.
[00:41:19.248 --> 00:41:23.429]  I know you're walking very carefully here, Daniel Ellsberg, but that's pretty strong medicine.
[00:41:23.649 --> 00:41:25.970]  And I think, you know, we have a look at the history of the world.
[00:41:26.630 --> 00:41:27.531]  Governments do this.
[00:41:27.591 --> 00:41:29.171]  As you mentioned, governments are liars.
[00:41:29.231 --> 00:41:30.172]  Governments are murderers.
[00:41:30.232 --> 00:41:31.552]  This is not above them.
[00:41:31.632 --> 00:41:33.233]  I'm sure you're familiar with the Northwoods document.
[00:41:34.592 --> 00:41:35.674]  Yes, indeed.
[00:41:35.734 --> 00:41:43.122]  Talking about a manufactured provocation which could have involved even a shooting down of an American or some other
[00:41:45.495 --> 00:41:50.398]  I would say, by the way, that Americans definitely play this game.
[00:41:50.458 --> 00:41:51.639]  I'm sure that it's happening now.
[00:41:52.700 --> 00:42:01.185]  I expected, by the way, Bush to manufacture a kind of Tonkin Gulf incident before he went into Iraq.
[00:42:01.825 --> 00:42:03.306]  And then I just said, well, I've been wrong.
[00:42:03.326 --> 00:42:04.507]  They didn't feel they needed that.
[00:42:05.831 --> 00:42:07.012]  We'll go ahead and cut it there, folks.
[00:42:07.052 --> 00:42:10.156]  That was Daniel Ellsberg, again from the Pentagon Papers.
[00:42:10.216 --> 00:42:15.061]  He leaked a large number of classified papers regarding the execution of the war.
[00:42:16.054 --> 00:42:19.155]  These documents later became collectively known as the Pentagon Papers.
[00:42:19.175 --> 00:42:27.577]  They revealed the knowledge early on that the war would not likely be won and that continuing the war would lead to many times more casualties than it was admitted publicly.
[00:42:28.097 --> 00:42:36.219]  Of course, the papers also showed a deep cynicism toward the public and a disregard for the loss of life and injuries suffered by soldiers and civilians.
[00:42:37.489 --> 00:42:39.170]  Now, what did he say there?
[00:42:39.210 --> 00:42:42.632]  He said that he's surprised there wasn't a Gulf of Tonkin incident prior to the war on Iraq.
[00:42:42.652 --> 00:42:44.773]  But we know that's exactly what 9-11 was, was our Gulf of Tonkin incident.
[00:42:44.793 --> 00:42:45.734]  You can call it our Reichstag.
[00:42:45.774 --> 00:42:46.954]  But what Daniel Ellsberg is saying
[00:43:00.322 --> 00:43:13.571]  He said, first of all, he agrees that there is some great information out there that would certainly need to lead to a new investigation, subpoenas, and really more questioning related to 9-11.
[00:43:13.951 --> 00:43:17.673]  No question that there's very serious questions have been raised.
[00:43:18.314 --> 00:43:23.978]  Is the administration capable of humanly and psychologically of engineering such a provocation?
[00:43:24.318 --> 00:43:26.159]  He says, yes, emphatically.
[00:43:26.579 --> 00:43:28.941]  They are capable, and as we know, they did.
[00:43:29.597 --> 00:43:36.020]  He goes on to say how he worked for the Johnson Administration and how they put destroyers in harm's way in the Gulf of Tonkin.
[00:43:36.300 --> 00:43:39.702]  Many, many times, which could have caused a major loss of life.
[00:43:40.542 --> 00:43:42.483]  But this led, of course, to the confrontation.
[00:43:43.364 --> 00:43:58.231]  And then he goes on to say again that the next time we get attacked, which he says no doubt will come right after the attack in Iran, that we will no doubt the next day have our own Reichstag fire here, where
[00:43:59.617 --> 00:44:16.006]  It'll be the equivalent of a Reichstag fire, will create massive detentions in this country, detentions of camps for Middle Easterners and their sympathizers, critics of the President's policy, and essentially the wiping out of the Bill of Rights.
[00:44:16.046 --> 00:44:20.208]  So again, very strong medicine, as I put it in the interview from Daniel Ellsberg.
[00:44:20.248 --> 00:44:25.651]  And we're now beginning to see, if you want to consider Daniel Ellsberg a leftist, and I believe that's what
[00:44:26.471 --> 00:44:28.072]  Whipster Tarp we alluded to yesterday.
[00:44:28.132 --> 00:44:34.695]  He is aligned with anti-war groups who have generally been very closed-minded to some of the issues of 9-11.
[00:44:35.235 --> 00:44:40.177]  Then take a look at Daniel Ellsberg who now appears to be breaking out of the pack.
[00:44:40.197 --> 00:44:42.078]  But that's what Daniel Ellsberg has always done.
[00:44:42.579 --> 00:44:43.979]  Breaking out of the pack.
[00:44:44.239 --> 00:44:45.340]  Leading the way.
[00:44:45.940 --> 00:44:52.743]  And now we need to get it through to some of these other anti-war protesters out there that 9-11 is the cataclysm.
[00:44:52.823 --> 00:44:54.563]  That's how we went to war.
[00:44:54.903 --> 00:45:03.266]  We've seen the FOIA requests being fulfilled to get the notes from Donald Rumsfeld on the ground, on the pentagon lawn.
[00:45:05.827 --> 00:45:10.531]  On 9-11, and what was he doing while he was supposedly saving bodies even though the entire country was under attack?
[00:45:10.551 --> 00:45:12.232]  He was out saving people.
[00:45:12.573 --> 00:45:13.694]  But what was he really doing?
[00:45:14.174 --> 00:45:25.383]  He was transcribing a note to his aide to go right to General Myers to find a way to blame this immediately on Osama Bin Laden and Saddam Hussein so that we can go have these wars.
[00:45:25.883 --> 00:45:26.924]  And of course, what happened?
[00:45:27.144 --> 00:45:32.309]  The next day, literally, a month later, we were on the way, rolling into Afghanistan.
[00:45:32.529 --> 00:45:36.773]  The next year, we were on the way, rolling through, on the ground, through Baghdad.
[00:45:37.013 --> 00:45:38.454]  But no, that wasn't enough!
[00:45:38.854 --> 00:45:45.260]  Because we have to get Syria, we have to get Iran, and as I say, if you're listening, Saudi Arabia and Egypt, we gotta get you too!
[00:45:46.266 --> 00:46:01.148]  So while we talked about this yesterday on my program, while Saudi Arabia and Osama Bin Laden seem to have almost identical aims to the President, and we might go ahead and say that they're being used by the neocons, by the Western global controllers,
[00:46:02.054 --> 00:46:04.975]  To set through their own oil empire.
[00:46:05.175 --> 00:46:07.196]  This is why, again, they're out against Iran.
[00:46:07.416 --> 00:46:09.457]  The United States is doing the exact same thing.
[00:46:09.917 --> 00:46:11.077]  And then, what happens?
[00:46:11.437 --> 00:46:20.380]  I mean, is this the enormous penalty, the enormous price that has to be paid to go into Iran that somebody like William Kristol is talking about?
[00:46:20.400 --> 00:46:30.884]  The enormous sacrifice that we must make in order to take advantage now of the opportunity to take out Iran and Syria and any of the other dominoes that need to fall?
[00:46:31.659 --> 00:46:32.860]  Is that what it's going to be?
[00:46:32.920 --> 00:46:34.700]  What Daniel Ellsberg was talking about?
[00:46:35.140 --> 00:46:36.921]  Camps set up for dissidents?
[00:46:36.981 --> 00:46:38.882]  Camps set up for all Middle Easterners?
[00:46:39.302 --> 00:46:53.287]  Much like World War II, when we locked up every Japanese American in the entire United States, and any sympathizers who might be involved in that provocation, that World War, that preemptive strike, our first Pearl Harbor?
[00:46:54.306 --> 00:46:56.768]  That's exactly what is being said.
[00:46:57.028 --> 00:47:07.176]  If you read even just a little bit between the lines, if you just kind of move the lines slightly apart and take a look deep inside that rabbit hole, that's exactly what you're going to see.
[00:47:07.376 --> 00:47:08.798]  The end of the Bill of Rights.
[00:47:09.038 --> 00:47:10.579]  The end of sovereignty.
[00:47:10.799 --> 00:47:12.140]  The end of freedom.
[00:47:14.062 --> 00:47:15.563]  The end of this country.
[00:47:17.213 --> 00:47:18.774]  And I'm not kidding around here, folks.
[00:47:18.794 --> 00:47:44.845]  When we see, every time we get out and we see one of these neocons, whether it be Bill O'Reilly or Sean Vanity, sorry, Bill O'Reilly, Sean Vanity, Lush Limpa, Laura Ingrate, Michael Weiner-Savage, no matter who it is, whenever we see these people get out on radio airwaves that go around the world that reach hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of stations and millions and millions of people calling for the head of Iran, this is what they mean!
[00:47:45.105 --> 00:47:46.486]  This is exactly what they mean.
[00:47:47.026 --> 00:47:48.927]  Another Reichstag here in the United States.
[00:47:49.167 --> 00:47:51.108]  The locking up of dissidents in camps.
[00:47:51.128 --> 00:47:53.429]  The locking up of all Middle Easterners in camps.
[00:47:53.469 --> 00:47:54.990]  Anyone who might be a sympathizer.
[00:47:55.110 --> 00:47:58.631]  Anyone who might disagree with this Bush administration.
[00:47:58.831 --> 00:48:01.492]  And, by the way, the next administration.
[00:48:03.153 --> 00:48:04.634]  And the administration after that.
[00:48:05.594 --> 00:48:08.655]  Which, no doubt, will be Bush, Clinton, Clinton, Bush, Bush, Bush, Bush.
[00:48:09.015 --> 00:48:09.896]  Poppy Bush.
[00:48:11.690 --> 00:48:19.857]  Who had a very heavy hand in what happened in Vietnam, who had a very heavy hand in what was going on with the Northwoods document.
[00:48:19.877 --> 00:48:25.643]  In fact, we could probably make a connection that he was involved in putting together something like the Northwoods document.
[00:48:26.143 --> 00:48:27.805]  We know he was involved in the Bay of Pigs.
[00:48:28.765 --> 00:48:32.469]  We know that he was likely involved in the Kennedy assassination, both of them.
[00:48:32.509 --> 00:48:35.592]  In fact, all three of them, if you count John F. Kennedy Jr.
[00:48:37.398 --> 00:48:43.503]  His fingerprints, the fingerprints of Poppy Bush, George Herbert Walker Bush, are on just about everything we see today.
[00:48:44.403 --> 00:48:45.484]  And who is he working for?
[00:48:45.524 --> 00:48:52.529]  He was a Rockefeller Republican, skull and bones man, German occultist, order of death.
[00:48:53.570 --> 00:48:55.491]  And that's exactly what is going to happen.
[00:48:55.631 --> 00:48:58.754]  Death and loss of sovereignty, without a doubt.
[00:48:58.794 --> 00:49:03.157]  I think it was very brave of Daniel Ellsberg to come out here and
[00:49:04.165 --> 00:49:06.266]  I want to thank InfoWars for making that all happen.
[00:49:06.306 --> 00:49:11.488]  I mean, folks, this should be getting out to everybody, out to every anti-war person, period.
[00:49:11.968 --> 00:49:15.430]  And we're working on several articles in order to help make that happen.
[00:49:16.390 --> 00:49:27.415]  But again, looking at history, this is what we've been talking about this first hour, quite simply, very plainly, looking at history, whether it be Vietnam, whether it be World War I or World War II,
[00:49:28.405 --> 00:49:40.914]  Whether it be the first war in Iraq, or the second war in Iraq, or the war in Kosovo, or the war in Afghanistan, or the current war with Israel and Lebanon, and potentially Syria and Iran, we see these fingerprints.
[00:49:40.954 --> 00:49:53.663]  We see this master plan, this great work as they call it, which ends in Fabian Socialism, a locked down, command and control, top of the pyramid controlling the bottom of the pyramid, new world order.
[00:49:54.424 --> 00:49:55.565]  One world government.
[00:49:56.667 --> 00:50:00.948]  It's absolutely unbelievable that people aren't seeing this yet.
[00:50:01.048 --> 00:50:02.468]  I mean, what more do we have to do?
[00:50:02.748 --> 00:50:13.270]  How many years do we have to be ahead of the curve and be proven right again and again and again and again while these neocons are proven wrong over and over and over and over before people get it?
[00:50:13.871 --> 00:50:21.292]  That if we simply look at the intelligence, we simply look at history, we add 1 plus 1 and it equals 2, doesn't equal 13.
[00:50:21.692 --> 00:50:22.212]  Doesn't equal 33.
[00:50:22.252 --> 00:50:22.772]  1 plus 1 equals 2.
[00:50:27.173 --> 00:50:30.615]  So how long do we have to scream into these microphones?
[00:50:30.835 --> 00:50:43.502]  How long do we have to get up on top of the giant pyramid or owl buildings and make these statements that are all coming true before people realize that they're centralizing everything and they're going to use war and death to do it?
[00:50:45.203 --> 00:50:46.984]  I'm very sorry about ranting.
[00:50:47.024 --> 00:50:47.945]  I'll come right back.
[00:50:48.065 --> 00:50:49.966]  More news and information you're not getting anywhere else.
[00:50:49.986 --> 00:50:52.307]  GCN Radio Network, this is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:50:52.587 --> 00:50:53.368]  InfoWars.com.
[00:51:00.161 --> 00:51:04.502]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:51:04.682 --> 00:51:09.124]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:51:09.264 --> 00:51:13.625]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:51:13.665 --> 00:51:15.046]  The New World Order.
[00:51:16.828 --> 00:51:21.032]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:51:21.092 --> 00:51:28.020]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:51:28.160 --> 00:51:30.163]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:51:30.543 --> 00:51:40.928]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:51:41.148 --> 00:51:46.531]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[00:52:12.973 --> 00:52:16.456]  The revolutionary Berkey Light removes pathogenic bacteria.
[00:52:16.716 --> 00:52:20.937]  Cysts, parasites, and harmful or unwanted chemicals to below detectable levels.
[00:52:21.217 --> 00:52:25.138]  It also removes foul tastes and odors like that rotten egg smell of sulfide.
[00:52:25.378 --> 00:52:31.900]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals your body needs.
[00:52:32.120 --> 00:52:37.602]  The Berkey Light is so powerful it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lake streams and stagnant ponds.
[00:52:37.862 --> 00:52:44.786]  The Berkey Light is transparent and glows in the dark with its rechargeable LED lighting system so it can be used as a night light or camp light.

[00:53:00.734 --> 00:53:01.194]  Thank you.
[00:53:16.039 --> 00:53:16.699]  We're good to go!
[00:53:45.555 --> 00:53:48.660]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[00:53:48.820 --> 00:53:54.689]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[00:54:05.655 --> 00:54:06.616]  Sing Ray!
[00:54:06.756 --> 00:54:07.196]  Sing Ray!
[00:54:07.276 --> 00:54:07.897]  Sing Ray!
[00:54:07.997 --> 00:54:08.597]  Sing Ray!
[00:54:32.170 --> 00:54:39.032]  Thanks for listening to the Alex Jones Show, folks.
[00:54:39.273 --> 00:54:41.773]  Jack Blood sitting in for Alex Jones today.
[00:54:41.833 --> 00:54:54.718]  Big interview coming up with an Israeli refuser, a military refuser of flu, choppers, rescue missions, also was in a Blackhawk squadron there.
[00:54:54.738 --> 00:54:57.199]  His name's Yonatan Shapiro.
[00:54:57.219 --> 00:54:59.880]  He'll be joining us here in just about 10 minutes on the program today.
[00:55:01.110 --> 00:55:14.637]  Just quickly, we just played that interview by Daniel Ellsberg, and he went on to say, after that, I didn't want to play the whole thing, I didn't think we had time, but he did go on to say that some of our leading Democrats are some of the biggest hawks we have in our government.
[00:55:15.258 --> 00:55:16.558]  So let's not forget that.
[00:55:17.419 --> 00:55:26.043]  While we're out there going, anybody but Bush, anybody but a Republican, let's remember who's going to fill those shoes.
[00:55:26.124 --> 00:55:28.645]  I have this image seared in my mind.
[00:55:30.003 --> 00:55:42.249]  With John Kerry coming up for the 2004 Coronation Ceremony in Boston at the Fleet Center in 2004 as he was receiving his nomination to run in the Skull and Bones Presidency.
[00:55:43.270 --> 00:55:49.413]  Saluting the audience, saying reporting for duty and making a speech about how tough he was going to be on Iraq.
[00:55:49.453 --> 00:55:50.854]  Now of course he's since flip-flopped.
[00:55:51.494 --> 00:55:52.334]  He's done some flip-flopping.
[00:55:54.378 --> 00:56:04.728]  It really tells us, and Ellsberg went on to talk about Biden, he went on to talk about Hillary Clinton, and all of those out there who might just jump right on the bandwagon for war.
[00:56:05.369 --> 00:56:11.255]  And how many of these people are being paid off by lobbying groups, Israeli lobbying groups like AIPAC?
[00:56:11.695 --> 00:56:16.640]  They can't do anything, including the wonderful Russ Feingold!
[00:56:17.515 --> 00:56:25.740]  Can't say anything, can't do anything, and in fact, people like Hillary Clinton actually going to meetings looking out a strike against Iran.
[00:56:25.760 --> 00:56:26.720]  She wants to be tough.
[00:56:27.040 --> 00:56:27.701]  She's a woman.
[00:56:28.001 --> 00:56:34.604]  She's in the position where she's really got to prove her mettle now, and they're putting a lot of pressure on Ms.
[00:56:34.705 --> 00:56:38.407]  Clinton, Schillary as I like to call her, in order to do so.
[00:56:38.447 --> 00:56:42.109]  To prove her mettle now in order to get that nomination.
[00:56:42.849 --> 00:56:46.231]  So she is just as out front as, in fact, maybe even more out front.
[00:56:46.829 --> 00:56:49.930]  Than President Bush and some of his administration members.
[00:56:50.230 --> 00:56:51.551]  Certainly not the neocons.
[00:56:52.691 --> 00:56:57.894]  Quickly, we have gone over a lot of history in the first hour of today's broadcast.
[00:56:58.014 --> 00:57:14.681]  And most of the history, in fact, I'm sure all of the history we've gone over, including Pearl Harbor, including the history of Iran, probably not anything more important to understand in this day and age, what is the history of Iran and how we managed to control every event there for the last 60 years.
[00:57:16.560 --> 00:57:18.322]  Okay, they're our brutal enemy now, right?
[00:57:19.383 --> 00:57:21.105]  Is contained in Terror Storm.
[00:57:21.145 --> 00:57:22.766]  This is a fantastic movie.
[00:57:22.906 --> 00:57:24.528]  Alex has really outdone himself.
[00:57:24.588 --> 00:57:29.633]  His crew has really gone the extra mile to put Terror Storm together.
[00:57:29.674 --> 00:57:30.795]  This is his best film.
[00:57:31.035 --> 00:57:32.737]  The soundtrack is professional.
[00:57:33.097 --> 00:57:37.562]  It clips in, not at four hours, but at a reasonable time for a documentary.
[00:57:37.922 --> 00:57:41.267]  It is going to be waking people up all over the planet Earth.
[00:57:41.287 --> 00:57:51.241]  It includes new information about 9-11, the newest information, including some of the information from the Scholars for Truth and some of the speakers at the 9-11 Symposium in Los Angeles.
[00:57:51.521 --> 00:57:52.943]  You need to get Terror Storm now.
[00:57:53.684 --> 00:57:55.806]  I believe some autographed copies left.
[00:57:55.906 --> 00:57:57.527]  Alex had autographed a number of the discs.
[00:57:57.547 --> 00:57:59.248]  This is a limited edition.
[00:57:59.268 --> 00:58:00.910]  These will be collector's items.

[00:58:59.395 --> 00:59:00.516]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:01.156 --> 00:59:01.956]  You want answers?
[00:59:02.736 --> 00:59:03.636]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:03.656 --> 00:59:07.957]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:08.478 --> 00:59:12.599]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:14.319 --> 00:59:17.840]  You want answers, we want answers, and we will not stop until we get them.
[00:59:19.105 --> 00:59:27.578]  We are exposing the lies, as I like to say, that our trusted public officials do not want us to know about, reporting all the news fit to suppress.
[00:59:28.620 --> 00:59:29.922]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:59:29.962 --> 00:59:34.069]  Jack Blood sitting in for Alex Jones today in this global transmission.
[00:59:35.592 --> 00:59:37.573]  Our next guest is Yonatan Shapira.
[00:59:37.633 --> 00:59:38.153]  He's 32.
[00:59:38.213 --> 00:59:41.113]  He's a captain in the Israeli Air Force Reserves.
[00:59:41.394 --> 00:59:44.054]  Yonatan is also a military refuser.
[00:59:44.414 --> 00:59:46.615]  Yonatan Shapira joined the IDF in 1991.
[00:59:46.675 --> 00:59:50.136]  He graduated from the Israeli Air Force Flight Course in 1993.
[00:59:50.976 --> 00:59:53.457]  He served as a regular in the Air Force until 1999.
[00:59:54.717 --> 01:00:02.459]  While a regular, Yonatan flew primarily as a rescue and assault helicopter pilot, completing well over 100 missions, including missions in Lebanon.
[01:00:02.799 --> 01:00:15.755]  In 2001, while a civilian pilot and a member of the Reserves, Yonatan was called back to service to become one of the founding members of the Israeli Air Force's new Black Hawk Squadron, for which he received specialized training in Alabama.
[01:00:16.460 --> 01:00:21.182]  Following initiations to the squadron, Yonatan resumed his status in the reserves.
[01:00:21.302 --> 01:00:24.663]  As a reservist, he served as a pilot, operations leader, and an instructor.
[01:00:25.003 --> 01:00:38.347]  In October 2003, Yonatan Shapira, along with 26 others, signed a declaration refusing to participate in aerial attacks on populated areas in the Palestinian territories because of the belief that these attacks are illegal.
[01:00:38.667 --> 01:00:41.490]  Now I'm in New York and next week I'm back in Israel-Palestine.
[01:00:59.580 --> 01:01:12.674]  We have a couple of minutes in this segment, Yonatan, and I'd like to kind of have you repeat in your own words kind of your history, your story, what happened to you as you were a member of the Israeli Air Force.
[01:01:14.135 --> 01:01:16.518]  Yeah, to say, to cut it in a short version,
[01:01:18.442 --> 01:01:33.427]  I was, in 2003, finally completely awakened from the fake belief that my country was pursuing peace and doing everything to defend us.
[01:01:35.728 --> 01:01:44.971]  What was the last straw that broke the camelback was the assassination policy that was led by the former Prime Minister, Ariel Sharon.
[01:01:46.111 --> 01:01:58.783]  The assassination policy was using the Air Force, F-16, Apaches, and all kinds of aircraft and helicopters to assassinate suspects in the Palestinian territories.
[01:01:59.503 --> 01:02:07.070]  We saw that as a result of this policy, many innocent people died, not just Palestinian innocent, but also Israeli innocent.
[01:02:07.925 --> 01:02:12.328]  And we felt that we are just part of this circle of mutual revenge.
[01:02:12.628 --> 01:02:23.374]  And we refused to be these tools for this corrupt government that lost every kind of leadership and sanity.
[01:02:24.555 --> 01:02:28.417]  Since then, we initiated this group.
[01:02:28.497 --> 01:02:33.660]  I wrote this letter that declared our refusal to participate in those illegal and immoral missions.
[01:02:34.645 --> 01:02:44.390]  And many pilots joined me from attack helicopter squadrons, from rescue helicopter squadrons, from fighter pilot squadrons.
[01:02:46.111 --> 01:02:54.016]  And we, in some way, were able to shake the Israeli society for a moment.
[01:02:54.476 --> 01:03:00.119]  But these kind of things maybe can work for a few minutes, few days, few months.
[01:03:00.825 --> 01:03:05.029]  And then everything is going back to its original situation.
[01:03:05.770 --> 01:03:07.191]  Now the situation is even worse.
[01:03:07.372 --> 01:03:21.045]  You say in 2003, I like the term you use, an awakening, finding out that a lot of the beliefs were phony, they were fake, that Israel was just protecting itself, that they were actually becoming an aggressor and using the...
[01:03:22.026 --> 01:03:24.147]  Bombing innocent civilians in order to do that.
[01:03:24.288 --> 01:03:27.509]  When we come back, I want to kind of talk a little bit more about that.
[01:03:27.529 --> 01:03:30.791]  I want to find out what else you might have found out after you woke up.
[01:03:30.811 --> 01:03:38.116]  I want to talk a little bit about your training and what's going through the minds of the pilots today as they're bombing Beirut and Lebanon and potentially Syria.
[01:03:38.336 --> 01:03:39.997]  Yonatan Shapira with us, folks.
[01:03:40.017 --> 01:03:40.617]  We'll be right back.
[01:03:40.657 --> 01:03:41.898]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[01:03:41.938 --> 01:03:43.279]  Jack Blood sitting in for Alex Jones.
[01:03:43.539 --> 01:03:44.160]  Don't go anywhere.
[01:03:53.092 --> 01:03:55.954]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[01:03:56.195 --> 01:03:57.796]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[01:03:58.116 --> 01:04:02.800]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[01:04:03.140 --> 01:04:09.886]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[01:04:10.206 --> 01:04:12.186]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has arisen.
[01:04:12.387 --> 01:04:15.227]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[01:04:15.327 --> 01:04:19.988]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[01:04:20.188 --> 01:04:24.589]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[01:04:24.829 --> 01:04:32.051]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.

[01:05:22.362 --> 01:05:24.243]  That's because it has an elevated base.

[01:06:36.301 --> 01:06:38.463]  We are with Yonatan Shapira.
[01:07:03.624 --> 01:07:27.560]  Captain of Israeli Air Force Reserves, also a military refuser, as Yonatan, along with 26 others in 2003, made a bold statement throughout Israel, refusing, signing a declaration, refusing to participate in more aerial attacks on populated areas in the Palestinian terrorists, because of the belief, again, that these attacks were illegal, immoral, and did not serve the ultimate security of Israel.
[01:07:27.600 --> 01:07:29.061]  In fact, many can make the case
[01:07:29.401 --> 01:07:34.985]  That is, it endangered Israel and endangered the rest of us because of this blatant aggression.
[01:07:35.225 --> 01:07:38.387]  Yonatan, I want to thank you very much for being on the program with us today.
[01:07:38.627 --> 01:07:49.354]  In the last segment, you talked about briefly how you really became awake in 2003 and began to understand exactly what was being sold to you as being primarily propaganda.
[01:07:49.775 --> 01:07:50.675]  What else did you learn?
[01:07:50.715 --> 01:07:52.997]  Did you learn more information about Sharon?
[01:07:53.017 --> 01:07:58.561]  Did you learn that Shin Bet, for instance, and forces within the Israeli government had funded Hamas
[01:07:59.281 --> 01:07:59.801]  We're good to go.
[01:08:16.590 --> 01:08:19.311]  The problem, you get to know a lot of other things.
[01:08:19.491 --> 01:08:25.173]  If you just want to see, if you just want to learn the reality, everything is out there waiting for you.
[01:08:26.313 --> 01:08:37.777]  Just like the United States sponsored the Taliban, Israel sponsored Hamas, from all the other stupid interests that those countries are, you know, being led by.
[01:08:37.797 --> 01:08:41.138]  So, I want to say a few words about, you know, why
[01:08:45.427 --> 01:08:48.949]  Why, I think that it's not just my moral decision.
[01:08:50.290 --> 01:08:52.331]  It's everything that we are doing.
[01:08:52.991 --> 01:08:57.634]  Even if we are not pilots, even if we are not soldiers in any army, or policemen, or whatever.
[01:08:58.214 --> 01:09:03.037]  Everything that we do, we are connected to some kind of system.
[01:09:03.777 --> 01:09:06.999]  And once you are part of a system, you have to take responsibility.
[01:09:07.816 --> 01:09:28.112]  So, although I was not flying machine guns, I was flying Blackhawk, I didn't shoot anyone myself, but I was part of a system, part of a system that commit crimes, that occupied millions of people for more than 39 years, and caused so many killing and death to so many innocents.
[01:09:28.853 --> 01:09:33.577]  So, my message to people that listening now to us,
[01:09:34.235 --> 01:09:38.497]  Is that each one of you have to take responsibility, must take responsibility.
[01:09:38.757 --> 01:09:41.419]  You don't have to be a pilot, you don't have to be a soldier to refuse.
[01:09:42.519 --> 01:09:44.880]  And that could go out to most of our military.
[01:09:44.900 --> 01:09:47.562]  You know, we have a lot of military people that listen to our program.
[01:09:47.882 --> 01:09:57.947]  We've had high-ranking generals on our programs talking about how we're creating terrorists faster than we can kill them, how the chain of command is responsible for the torture
[01:09:58.407 --> 01:09:59.948]  Yeah, and we are trying to do these kind of things.
[01:10:28.573 --> 01:10:31.614]  Not just in Israel, not just in Palestine, but also around the world.
[01:10:31.674 --> 01:10:42.477]  We are doing lecture tours and meeting with youngsters, with old people, with Jewish, with Arabs, with every kind, everyone who can listen to us.
[01:10:43.117 --> 01:10:54.680]  We will come and tell him this fact, because, you know, these kind of wars will not last forever in this low scale.
[01:10:55.440 --> 01:10:56.861]  Everything can escalate very fast.
[01:10:57.896 --> 01:11:02.778]  And it's our job and it's our obligation to fight against this, to struggle against it.
[01:11:03.259 --> 01:11:06.280]  And for that reason, we established the organization.
[01:11:06.400 --> 01:11:08.801]  Maybe if I have one minute, I can tell you about that.
[01:11:09.461 --> 01:11:11.562]  The organization name is Combatants for Peace.
[01:11:12.223 --> 01:11:13.904]  In Hebrew, it's Lochamim L'Shalom.
[01:11:14.384 --> 01:11:17.765]  In Arabic, it's Muqatalun Min Ajwar El Salam.
[01:11:18.666 --> 01:11:25.449]  And the idea is that former combatants from the Israeli army and from Fatah,
[01:11:26.067 --> 01:11:31.891]  and other militias in the Palestinian side understood that with violence we will not win.
[01:11:32.171 --> 01:11:36.735]  With violence means we will not get anything to our own people.
[01:11:37.255 --> 01:11:50.264]  And we decided to cooperate together and for about a year and a half we are meeting in Israel and Palestine and discussing our own decision and how we are going to create this change within our societies.
[01:11:50.971 --> 01:12:05.377]  And in October, in two months from now, we're going to have a tour in the east and west coast of the United States in campuses by Palestinian and Israeli refusers that will share their
[01:12:06.736 --> 01:12:15.959]  Experience and their opinions about the situation and if we can be friends and if we can talk to each other I think everyone can talk to each other.
[01:12:15.979 --> 01:12:25.343]  This is so important that you guys and by the way your website is combatantsforpeace.org if people want to jump on your bandwagon and find a way to support you and support this effort.
[01:12:25.643 --> 01:12:31.546]  I think it's extremely important that you guys are linked arms with Palestinian refusers as well.
[01:12:31.646 --> 01:12:39.429]  So here we have some of the first people coming out refusing to fight each other in these really what are manufactured wars.
[01:12:39.689 --> 01:12:41.630]  That is so extremely important.
[01:12:42.031 --> 01:12:45.152]  We see a lot of leftists in Israel now opposing the war.
[01:12:45.172 --> 01:12:49.354]  At least that's what they're called because here in our country I am a paleo-conservative.
[01:12:49.854 --> 01:12:55.277]  I'd like you to know, Yonatan, so I am basically an old-school conservative and I'm against the war.
[01:12:55.337 --> 01:12:59.320]  So you see, not everybody is a leftist or a liberal who is against the war.
[01:12:59.400 --> 01:13:02.722]  What type of names have you been called?
[01:13:02.782 --> 01:13:05.163]  How do they malign your group in Israel?
[01:13:06.204 --> 01:13:12.167]  You know, when I give lectures, when I talk in the media in Israel, in Europe, in the United States,
[01:13:12.645 --> 01:13:22.669]  Sometimes, you know, people call me names because, you know, people think that I betrayed my country or stupid things like that, although I feel that they did just the opposite.
[01:13:24.149 --> 01:13:40.855]  But when we stand in front of people from all those kind of groups and backgrounds, and we represent the non-insane representative of those people, people who used violence
[01:13:41.374 --> 01:13:49.923]  And we're in the military, in militias, and now suggest this better solution for our problem.
[01:13:50.524 --> 01:13:51.805]  People become speechless.
[01:13:52.346 --> 01:13:53.827]  They can't say anything.
[01:13:54.067 --> 01:14:03.037]  Because here we are standing, Palestinian with Israelis, saying that with violence we will not save and will not solve any of these problems.
[01:14:04.107 --> 01:14:17.717]  You're not attacked in the media in Israel or even attacked in the media here in the United States or anywhere else around the world, as you said, being a betrayer of your country or refusing to fight, maybe somehow being a coward.
[01:14:17.757 --> 01:14:21.319]  I mean, these are the things we see happen to our veterans here in the United States.
[01:14:22.540 --> 01:14:22.780]  Okay.
[01:14:23.121 --> 01:14:26.083]  I don't have a problem with someone calling me a coward when I know that
[01:14:28.314 --> 01:14:36.978]  The courage that it deserves, you know, it demands from a pilot to say, no, no more, I will not participate in this shit anymore.
[01:14:38.238 --> 01:14:46.842]  It's much more than, you know, the courage that you have to fly a low-level flight at night into Lebanon and wait for someone to shoot at you.
[01:14:47.503 --> 01:14:52.726]  It's much different and from my experience I can tell you that they deserve much more courage.
[01:14:52.846 --> 01:15:02.030]  I have to remind you we're on American radio here where there are certain FCC rules, so we've got to tone you down just a little bit there, Yonatan, and have a language, okay?
[01:15:02.671 --> 01:15:19.442]  Are you looking, that's okay, are you seeing now, I mean it's gotta just drive you crazy to see what the cable news networks are reporting, what the neocon talking heads on the radio are reporting, calling for strikes on Syria and Iran.
[01:15:20.123 --> 01:15:22.965]  In fact, let me play this clip very briefly.
[01:15:23.125 --> 01:15:30.430]  James Woolsey, our former CIA director here in the United States, on John Gibson's show on Fox News, calling for an attack on Syria.
[01:15:30.670 --> 01:15:31.831]  Go ahead John and roll that quickly.
[01:15:32.550 --> 01:15:34.626]  Are you convinced this is Iran and Syria?
[01:15:35.546 --> 01:15:43.752]  Well certainly, I think Iran is the puppet master and Syria and Hezbollah and Hamas to varying degrees are the puppets.
[01:15:44.092 --> 01:15:47.055]  This is really about Iran versus the U.S.
[01:15:47.575 --> 01:15:49.697]  and Israel is in the way.
[01:15:50.437 --> 01:15:53.379]  Are you saying that we should be hitting Syria?
[01:15:53.639 --> 01:15:55.141]  We should be hitting the airport?
[01:15:55.261 --> 01:15:57.642]  We should be hitting Bashar Assad's office?
[01:15:58.023 --> 01:16:00.224]  Yes, the last thing we ought to do now.
[01:16:00.485 --> 01:16:02.126]  You mean we in the United States, not Israel?
[01:16:02.686 --> 01:16:02.926]  Yes.
[01:16:03.547 --> 01:16:09.271]  I think the last thing we ought to do now is to start talking about ceasefires and the rest.
[01:16:09.391 --> 01:16:10.992]  Iran has drawn a line in the sand.
[01:16:11.633 --> 01:16:14.775]  They've sent Hezbollah and Hamas against Israel.
[01:16:15.155 --> 01:16:17.056]  They're pushing their nuclear weapons program.
[01:16:17.076 --> 01:16:20.919]  They're helping North Korea, working with them on a ballistic missile program.
[01:16:21.239 --> 01:16:25.943]  They're doing their best to take over southern Iraq with Muqtada al-Sadr and some of their other proxies.
[01:16:26.783 --> 01:16:36.806]  This is a very serious challenge from Iran and we need to weaken them badly and undermining the Syrian government with airstrikes would help weaken them.
[01:16:37.066 --> 01:16:44.828]  If undermining Syria, if taking Syria down a peg or two by actually hitting them with airstrikes would be effective, why not hit something in Iran?
[01:16:46.081 --> 01:16:50.722]  Well, you know, one has to take things to some degree by steps.
[01:16:51.322 --> 01:17:09.166]  I think it would be a huge blow to Iran if the Israelis are able, after a few more days' effort, to badly damage Hezbollah in Hamas, as they are doing, and if we were able to help undermine the continuation of the Assad regime.
[01:17:10.410 --> 01:17:16.592]  Okay, and that's just, Yonatan, just one small example of what we're seeing in the mainstream media here in the United States.
[01:17:16.732 --> 01:17:22.114]  James Woolsey, former CIA director, says it's really about Iran versus the United States.
[01:17:22.194 --> 01:17:23.774]  No ceasefires or arrests.
[01:17:23.794 --> 01:17:26.295]  He wants airstrikes on Syria immediately.
[01:17:27.155 --> 01:17:32.217]  He's also, this particular gentleman has also said that we've been in World War IV since 2003.
[01:17:32.717 --> 01:17:35.138]  Part of this group, Americans for Victory Over Terrorism.
[01:17:35.158 --> 01:17:36.458]  What is your response to something like that?
[01:17:36.598 --> 01:17:49.763]  Let's not forget that according to CIA former members, the CIA is responsible for between 12 to 15 million people who died in the last 60 years.
[01:17:53.834 --> 01:18:01.944]  Because of wars that the CIA... 12 to 15 million people you've assessed have died through the CIA actions over the last 50, 60 years.
[01:18:02.765 --> 01:18:08.693]  Yeah, it's not me saying it, it's members, former members from the CIA that sat in the...
[01:18:09.997 --> 01:18:10.257]  I think so.
[01:18:32.938 --> 01:18:35.661]  These guys are now very, very close to your leaders.
[01:18:36.082 --> 01:18:36.282]  Right.
[01:18:36.722 --> 01:18:38.264]  Let's continue with this when we come back.
[01:18:38.304 --> 01:18:42.048]  Yonatan Shapira with us, combatsforpeace.org.
[01:18:42.108 --> 01:18:45.793]  This is the Alex Jones Show, infowars.com, prisonplanet.com.
[01:18:45.813 --> 01:18:47.294]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
[01:18:47.314 --> 01:18:47.715]  Stay tuned.
[01:18:52.122 --> 01:18:58.106]  I used to be ashamed of my toenails, so I thought I was destined to wear tennis shoes through the heat of the summer and hide my toes at the beach.
[01:18:58.526 --> 01:19:01.188]  And then my podiatrist told me about Non-X Nail Gel.
[01:19:01.348 --> 01:19:05.951]  It tackles unsightly nails by clearing out the cause of the problem, yellowing keratin debris buildup.
[01:19:06.131 --> 01:19:10.935]  With regular use, Non-X Gel breaks down and removes the debris, so toenails look clear.
[01:19:11.115 --> 01:19:15.858]  This summer I'm wearing open-toed sandals again, thanks to a topical natural gel called Non-X.
[01:19:16.078 --> 01:19:18.760]  If your toenails are embarrassing, I recommend Non-X Nail Gel.
[01:19:18.980 --> 01:19:21.882]  It's at your pharmacy or mass retailer in the foot care section.
[01:19:23.162 --> 01:19:24.163]  Looking for profits?

[01:19:26.063 --> 01:19:29.164]  The $10 Olympic commemorative gold coin offers both.
[01:19:29.204 --> 01:19:36.486]  This low mintage collector coin with a total series mintage under $600,000 has sold at four times its current price.
[01:19:36.846 --> 01:19:40.327]  Falling dollar values and inflation make this likely to happen again.

[01:20:45.810 --> 01:20:54.654]  The War on Terrorism.
[01:20:54.975 --> 01:20:57.756]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[01:20:58.036 --> 01:21:02.179]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[01:21:02.619 --> 01:21:03.459]  So what do you do?
[01:21:03.759 --> 01:21:08.322]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[01:21:08.823 --> 01:21:10.923]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[01:21:11.423 --> 01:21:26.126]  Sheltering in Place, Surviving Acts of Terrorism from Biological, Chemical, and Radioactive Fallouts, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.

[01:21:56.799 --> 01:21:59.601]  Do you realize that the race for the cure is over?
[01:22:01.169 --> 01:22:10.835]  The best-kept secret in the world today is that now it is possible to kill cancer without personal suffering, mutilation, and poisoning of your entire system.

[01:22:55.127 --> 01:22:57.991]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:23:03.318 --> 01:23:04.539]  Jonathan Shapiro with us.
[01:23:05.402 --> 01:23:19.117]  The captain of the Israeli Air Force Reserves refused to continue to go on with the violence now living here in the United States and has put together an organization along with a lot of other very good people, including Palestinian refusers.
[01:23:19.718 --> 01:23:21.019]  CombatForPeace.org.
[01:23:21.039 --> 01:23:22.100]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[01:23:22.140 --> 01:23:23.722]  Jack Flood sitting in for Alex Jones.
[01:23:24.002 --> 01:23:27.286]  This is the GCN Radio Network, your first source for alternative news.
[01:23:27.873 --> 01:23:36.140]  Yonatan Shapira, if we could spend a little bit of time talking about how you got involved in military service with the Israeli Air Force.
[01:23:36.320 --> 01:23:41.925]  I know you entered into the military at 17 years old and got your flight training finished with by 19.
[01:23:42.746 --> 01:23:47.270]  Can you talk about the process of how people get into the military in Israel?
[01:23:47.770 --> 01:23:49.472]  It's not exactly details.
[01:23:49.532 --> 01:23:53.115]  First, our website is combatantsforpeace.org
[01:23:55.505 --> 01:24:11.775]  And about my service, just like every other Israeli young boy who finish high school, I went to the military, I was 18, 19 years old, and the pilot course take two years.
[01:24:12.515 --> 01:24:18.919]  And once you finish this course, if you finish the course, you have to sign for five more years.
[01:24:20.721 --> 01:24:23.723]  And as we know it's precursory to go into the military in Israel.
[01:24:23.803 --> 01:24:29.026]  What happens if people are conscientious objectors or they refuse to fight?
[01:24:29.547 --> 01:24:33.029]  So now we have more and more conscious objectors.
[01:24:33.089 --> 01:24:39.213]  When I was enlisting to the military I was not aware of this fact.
[01:24:39.374 --> 01:24:42.255]  I was very very Zionist.
[01:24:42.376 --> 01:24:43.756]  I was very sure about my
[01:24:46.442 --> 01:24:55.786]  The country is doing the right thing, trying to get, you know, to bring us peace and all this kind of fake lies that I happen to know later.
[01:24:56.446 --> 01:25:02.709]  But nowadays we have thousands of Israelis who do not believe these kind of lies.
[01:25:03.269 --> 01:25:10.412]  And we have conscious objectors, youngsters who finish high school and go to serve in prison instead of serving in the army.
[01:25:10.852 --> 01:25:14.354]  Some of them were a year, some of them were two, some of them just a few months.
[01:25:15.029 --> 01:25:18.672]  And many of them just find a way out from the army.
[01:25:19.233 --> 01:25:23.336]  What type of treatment would they receive in prison, getting two, three, four years in prison?
[01:25:24.117 --> 01:25:25.738]  No, no, not so many years.
[01:25:26.879 --> 01:25:33.425]  The condition of conscious objectors in Israel is much, much better than the condition of these people here in the United States.
[01:25:34.066 --> 01:25:37.268]  Let's not forget that, I believe that you are from Texas?
[01:25:38.129 --> 01:25:39.390]  Well, I'm living in Texas, yeah.
[01:25:39.630 --> 01:25:42.653]  Yeah, Texas still has death penalties, if I'm not wrong.
[01:25:43.211 --> 01:25:50.594]  For people who are refusing, they don't use it, but people can spend much more time in prison.
[01:25:51.094 --> 01:26:01.418]  In Israel, the longest term was one year during the trial, during the court system stuff, and then another year in jail.
[01:26:02.659 --> 01:26:10.682]  Most of these guys are serving a short period of time and then coming in and out again and again because the army, you know,
[01:26:11.195 --> 01:26:13.675]  Let's do them each time they out again.
[01:26:15.716 --> 01:26:21.557]  If you can permit me to say something to our Jewish community audience.
[01:26:21.877 --> 01:26:22.317]  Yes, please.
[01:26:22.597 --> 01:26:23.697]  It's very important for me.
[01:26:23.857 --> 01:26:31.959]  I think that, you know, maybe some people listen to me and think that, OK, he is a radical, crazy Israeli, you know, he's frustrated or something like that.
[01:26:32.699 --> 01:26:39.840]  And I want to tell these people that, you know, for many years I risked my life in flying in Lebanon, in the territories.
[01:26:40.365 --> 01:26:43.267]  I rescued many people, many soldiers, many civilians.
[01:26:43.347 --> 01:26:46.529]  I was working with terror victims in the Israeli side.
[01:26:47.209 --> 01:26:53.373]  I know from very, very close distance this horrible situation also for the Israelis.
[01:26:54.334 --> 01:27:08.162]  And that's why I'm talking out, I'm doing everything out of love to my country, out of my great connection to my Jewish tradition, to my people, and to my great desire to live in peace in my country.
[01:27:09.005 --> 01:27:22.859]  And if these people who now listen to us, that connected somehow to Israel, by being Jewish, by being, you know, just Americans who care about what's going on there, if you do care, you must be against my government.
[01:27:23.500 --> 01:27:32.329]  This government is doing everything now that will unfortunately be concluded by the destruction of my country.
[01:27:32.924 --> 01:27:34.646]  And I want to live in Israel.
[01:27:34.726 --> 01:27:36.268]  I want to raise my family in Israel.
[01:27:36.308 --> 01:27:37.810]  I want to have babies in Israel.
[01:27:38.170 --> 01:27:39.392]  And I want to work in Israel.
[01:27:39.973 --> 01:27:49.484]  But the thing that I'm going now on, if we won't stop it by external pressure, I don't see a future for my country.
[01:27:49.524 --> 01:27:52.548]  And this is the most disturbing thing for me now.
[01:27:53.368 --> 01:27:55.629]  Well, and we often say the same thing here in our country.
[01:27:55.669 --> 01:28:03.174]  We want to make sure that people understand that we're not bringing out this information because we're against the people of Israel, or that we're anti-American.
[01:28:03.234 --> 01:28:07.656]  We put that disclaimer out as well, Yonatan, and I'm glad you were able to do that.
[01:28:07.716 --> 01:28:13.279]  And, you know, we want you to get your message out here, but it's very rare that we have a chance to talk to somebody like yourself.
[01:28:13.619 --> 01:28:17.982]  When we come back, if you could stay with us, I want to talk about what's going through the minds
[01:28:18.522 --> 01:28:24.187]  of the kids fighting now as they're bombing again Lebanon and potentially even Syria.
[01:28:24.447 --> 01:28:25.768]  Stay with us, Yonatan Shapiro.
[01:28:25.808 --> 01:28:27.229]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[01:28:27.549 --> 01:28:30.071]  I'm Jack Bloodfilling for Alex Jones, Infowars.com.
[01:28:42.401 --> 01:28:43.301]  We're on the march.
[01:28:43.782 --> 01:28:45.283]  The Empire's on the run.

[01:29:52.392 --> 01:29:58.636]  The illuminated Berkey Base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[01:29:58.776 --> 01:30:04.939]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[01:30:05.220 --> 01:30:13.665]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[01:30:13.905 --> 01:30:20.929]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[01:30:21.229 --> 01:30:26.052]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[01:30:26.252 --> 01:30:31.676]  The Berkey Base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[01:30:31.996 --> 01:30:35.078]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.

[01:30:58.297 --> 01:31:00.500]  Globalists are concerned with what's good for
[01:31:08.736 --> 01:31:09.277]  We're good to go.

[01:32:03.206 --> 01:32:04.507]  Yonatan Shapiro with us.
[01:32:04.968 --> 01:32:27.927]  Combatantsforpeace.org is the website and the group of freedom-loving citizens of this world, both Palestinians and Israelis, joining together about to launch a national tour here in the United States to get the message of peace out to the people so that we don't think that every Israeli or every Palestinian is bent on death and destruction.
[01:32:28.227 --> 01:32:29.849]  Yonatan, thanks again for joining us.
[01:32:30.389 --> 01:32:37.013]  One quick question about your military training and then I want to talk about some current events and then we're going to take some calls here and hear from our listeners.
[01:32:37.333 --> 01:32:44.658]  You trained, you received specialized training in Alabama here in the United States for this work you did with the new Blackhawk squadron.
[01:32:44.898 --> 01:32:53.383]  Was that specific to just this Blackhawk squadron in a technical capacity or is this just the way all Air Force are trained here in America?
[01:32:53.403 --> 01:32:56.405]  No sir, we were just
[01:32:58.362 --> 01:33:06.230]  So this isn't standard practice that much of the Air Force and the military in Israel are trained here in the United States?
[01:33:20.432 --> 01:33:21.793]  Let's talk about current events.
[01:33:21.913 --> 01:33:39.617]  The recent conflict, of course there was indiscriminate bombing going on for weeks in Palestine, which I think some people have already forgotten, but the recent conflict in Lebanon was technically started by a kidnapped soldier, as was the debacle in Palestine as well.
[01:33:39.657 --> 01:33:40.858]  Give me your feelings on this.
[01:33:41.418 --> 01:33:43.138]  Are a lot of soldiers kidnapped?
[01:33:43.178 --> 01:33:45.099]  How many are lost in these conflicts?
[01:33:46.426 --> 01:33:47.067]  Ordinary?
[01:33:47.087 --> 01:33:52.251]  In other words, is this something that's routine when somebody gets kidnapped for bombings to begin?
[01:33:52.291 --> 01:33:53.813]  I mean, give us some perspective on that.
[01:33:54.673 --> 01:34:01.199]  Yeah, first of all, the full details, I think, I believe people can find out in those websites and the news and everything like that.
[01:34:01.279 --> 01:34:11.308]  But I think it's important to understand that, you know, we condemned the violence of the Palestinian side and the violence of the Hezbollah side.
[01:34:12.034 --> 01:34:16.676]  And we believe that with non-violent action we will achieve much more.
[01:34:16.976 --> 01:34:20.358]  So this is for the basic, before I start to answer.
[01:34:20.898 --> 01:34:27.101]  But things didn't start when the soldier, the Israeli soldier, was kidnapped in Gaza.
[01:34:28.182 --> 01:34:36.106]  Those weeks before were terrible fascinations that most of the people who died were civilians, innocent Palestinians.
[01:34:38.849 --> 01:34:50.055]  The reason that it led to this escalation is because on the month before, and even years before, my government still refused to talk with the Palestinians.
[01:34:50.655 --> 01:35:02.602]  They want to commit unilateral moves and finish this conflict with power and with unilateral policy.
[01:35:03.371 --> 01:35:11.920]  And this is the root reason of this current violence.
[01:35:12.341 --> 01:35:17.266]  Were they waiting for a pretext, Yonatan, or did they create the pretext in order to go into Lebanon?
[01:35:17.666 --> 01:35:21.831]  You know, that's the thing you should ask the Israeli official representative.
[01:35:22.923 --> 01:35:41.414]  But I can tell you that, you know, missiles on the north, on Haifa and Nafula, it's something that very easily, you know, make, you know, push all the triggers on those generals and prime minister and minister of defense in Israel.
[01:35:41.935 --> 01:35:50.200]  So you don't have to convince and to do a lot of work to make, to mobilize the people to go to fight Lebanon.
[01:35:50.771 --> 01:35:52.573]  When you have missiles falling on their cities.
[01:35:53.274 --> 01:35:56.138]  It's a fact that we should not forget.
[01:35:56.678 --> 01:35:59.061]  We covered this earlier in our program.
[01:35:59.101 --> 01:36:06.350]  We were talking about when Japan was provoked by the United States and then of course we saw Pearl Harbor following that.
[01:36:07.373 --> 01:36:08.975]  Uh, and this, you know, it can be done.
[01:36:09.015 --> 01:36:21.390]  In fact, there are strategies throughout history that provokes terrorists to get them active so that you can, again, legitimize what you're trying to move forward with military action or otherwise.
[01:36:21.430 --> 01:36:23.873]  We also talked about how it's been proven that
[01:36:24.353 --> 01:36:31.716]  Our President FDR, Roosevelt, left Americans in the Philippines for good war propaganda, even knowing that they would be killed.
[01:36:32.257 --> 01:36:34.698]  A lot of them trying to get some type of restitution for that.
[01:36:34.758 --> 01:36:38.539]  Now, we have 25,000 Americans locked into Lebanon.
[01:36:38.579 --> 01:36:42.161]  It appears not a major effort to try to airlift them out.
[01:36:42.541 --> 01:36:45.462]  Are you afraid, as maybe we are, that they could be used?
[01:36:45.562 --> 01:36:51.925]  Maybe something happens to them and this could escalate this further and involve the United States into this military conflict?
[01:36:53.171 --> 01:37:07.183]  You know, I think there are so many good reasons for the United States to... not good, I mean bad reasons, but they perceive them as good reasons to join this war and to attack Iran and all this kind of stuff.
[01:37:08.596 --> 01:37:12.719]  I don't think that they have to have all these pretexts.
[01:37:12.759 --> 01:37:17.362]  They can find them, they can later on write some good propaganda and spread it on.
[01:37:17.462 --> 01:37:19.684]  Well, it's not as easy as it used to be, Yonatan.
[01:37:19.704 --> 01:37:31.313]  I gotta tell you, I mean, here in the United States, a lot of generals, people in the Joint Chiefs of Staff, people at the Pentagon, people in the State Department dissenting, not wanting to go into this plan to go to Syria in Iran.
[01:37:31.373 --> 01:37:33.555]  They feel we have our hands full now with Afghanistan and Iran.
[01:37:34.416 --> 01:37:45.253]  I think, as I told you before the interview, I said that people do not like to go to wars, but the only thing that you have to do is just tell them that they are being attacked.
[01:37:46.016 --> 01:37:51.822]  And you can do it here today, American public, and you can do it in Israel, and then you have war.
[01:37:52.042 --> 01:37:55.625]  And that's exactly the reason that I believe that the U.S.
[01:37:55.665 --> 01:37:58.568]  will not stop the current violence.
[01:37:58.908 --> 01:38:02.992]  If we have some kind of hope now, is that the European leaders will wake up.
[01:38:04.313 --> 01:38:08.755]  And understand that if they don't want to see another Holocaust in the region, they must act now.
[01:38:09.556 --> 01:38:11.036]  We don't want their money.
[01:38:11.396 --> 01:38:16.139]  We don't want one hand giving us aid and one hand giving us a weapon.
[01:38:16.479 --> 01:38:24.743]  We need them to stop all the support to the Israeli military and to force the sides to sit down and negotiate.
[01:38:26.385 --> 01:38:29.386]  Well, I was going to ask you later on in the interview if that's possible.
[01:38:29.426 --> 01:38:33.167]  I think I'll save that for some type of a solution here as we wind this up.
[01:38:33.407 --> 01:38:35.528]  Just quickly, I want to take some phone calls, Yonatan.
[01:38:36.228 --> 01:38:41.330]  What is going through the mind of the people running the bomb raids currently out of Israel?
[01:38:41.670 --> 01:38:44.091]  Can you put us in their mind?
[01:38:44.131 --> 01:38:45.851]  Can you tell us what they're thinking?
[01:38:45.891 --> 01:38:48.752]  Are they just robots going in and following orders?
[01:38:48.832 --> 01:38:49.712]  Or are they torn?
[01:38:50.012 --> 01:38:51.093]  Is there inter-conflict?
[01:38:51.153 --> 01:38:54.794]  Is there bombing these civilian areas in Israel?
[01:38:55.274 --> 01:38:56.735]  In Beirut now?
[01:38:57.776 --> 01:39:04.081]  You know, again, I didn't drop any bomb in my life, and I'm very happy about that.
[01:39:04.161 --> 01:39:05.142]  But you know people that did.
[01:39:05.362 --> 01:39:19.374]  But I must tell you that a soldier or a pilot or an officer who is being sent by his commander is quite sure that he is going to protect civilians.
[01:39:20.402 --> 01:39:33.435]  And this, you know, it deserves a lot of propaganda, a lot of half-side history lessons, and eventually you have to pull a trigger and to press some button.
[01:39:34.136 --> 01:39:39.601]  But you are so confident before then that you're doing it in order to protect people.
[01:39:40.162 --> 01:39:44.026]  And actually, you know, if I was now in the military,
[01:39:44.691 --> 01:39:47.573]  And I was still, you know, believing the system.
[01:39:48.173 --> 01:39:57.859]  And my commander would tell me that, you know, you must attack this car because this car is going to blow itself and kill thousands of people.
[01:39:58.099 --> 01:40:03.762]  You know, you make the calculation, you understand that you should protect these thousands of people.
[01:40:04.183 --> 01:40:07.124]  But the problem is that we do not believe this system anymore.
[01:40:07.465 --> 01:40:08.065]  And these guys,
[01:40:08.641 --> 01:40:09.261]  Yeah.
[01:40:09.301 --> 01:40:14.382]  In fact, what Israel has said to you in the past is, peace is just around the corner.
[01:40:14.423 --> 01:40:15.143]  Just relax.
[01:40:15.163 --> 01:40:18.063]  This is all going to end up in peace just tomorrow or the next day.
[01:40:18.083 --> 01:40:21.624]  Yeah, and I can assure you that most of the pilots are leftist.
[01:40:21.784 --> 01:40:27.806]  Most of the pilots are, you know, voting for left parties, for the Labour or for even the Merits Party.
[01:40:28.973 --> 01:40:44.260]  I know some pilots who are still serving, who even vote for the Israeli Arab Party, and it sounds ridiculous, but these guys are, just like you said, they think that the system will lead us eventually, will lead us eventually to peace.
[01:40:44.861 --> 01:40:49.042]  And they still have some kind of confidence and belief in the system.
[01:40:49.222 --> 01:40:49.982]  And that's the problem.
[01:40:50.362 --> 01:41:00.604]  I don't know if you're familiar with George Orwell's 1984, but in doublespeak, war is peace, and this is of course what is being packaged and sold to the American people, the people around the world as well.
[01:41:00.624 --> 01:41:01.524]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:41:01.624 --> 01:41:12.866]  We're opening up the phone lines for Yonatan Shapira, former captain in the Israeli Air Force who refused to continue to be involved in the attacks on foreign countries.
[01:41:13.406 --> 01:41:24.594]  Currently residing here stateside his organization again combatantsforpeace.org 1-800-259-9231 We are live on the Alex Jones Show this 18th day of July 2006.
[01:41:24.634 --> 01:41:27.356]  Let's go to Wolfgang in Kansas.
[01:41:27.616 --> 01:41:28.857]  Wolfgang, thank you for holding.
[01:41:28.877 --> 01:41:30.258]  You're on the air with Yonatan Shapira.
[01:41:31.119 --> 01:41:32.240]  Hello Jack, how are you doing?
[01:41:32.360 --> 01:41:32.780]  I'm okay.
[01:41:32.960 --> 01:41:33.220]  Good.
[01:41:33.460 --> 01:41:34.041]  Great show.
[01:41:34.981 --> 01:41:37.643]  I really commend his efforts for refusing to fight.
[01:41:37.663 --> 01:41:42.687]  I myself as an American military veteran have been in the same situation.
[01:41:43.160 --> 01:41:48.684]  In the American military, you have a duty to refuse illegal orders under the Law of Warfare.
[01:41:48.704 --> 01:41:49.764]  I don't know if you know that or not.
[01:41:49.844 --> 01:41:51.806]  Yeah, it's the same in the Israeli military.
[01:41:52.366 --> 01:42:08.637]  So, if the scenario ever came up where the military people that are listening to this program would just refuse to go along or to carry out these missions, we wouldn't have anybody to fight these wars now, would we?
[01:42:10.259 --> 01:42:16.263]  Well, nor would we have anybody to defend the country in case there was a real threat, which I guess is always possible.
[01:42:16.343 --> 01:42:18.145]  Not probable, but certainly possible.
[01:42:18.525 --> 01:42:26.171]  Right, I'm talking about specifically Iraq, and if we're going into Iran, this is all set up for Iran, I think there should be a mutiny in the military.
[01:42:26.591 --> 01:42:27.632]  I think there kind of is.
[01:42:28.512 --> 01:42:29.633]  Yonatan, you want to comment on that?
[01:42:30.534 --> 01:42:34.917]  Yeah, I just want to refer to the first part about the illegal order.
[01:42:35.618 --> 01:42:41.761]  That exactly was the argument that we used when we wrote our refusal letter in Israel and we published it.
[01:42:41.801 --> 01:42:46.984]  And that's the reason, that's exactly the reason that none of us, you know, went to jail.
[01:42:47.504 --> 01:42:56.649]  Because we used the army law, we used the Israeli constitution to struggle against the actions of the army and the Israeli government.
[01:42:57.429 --> 01:43:00.090]  You know, if you tried that here in this country, it wouldn't fly.
[01:43:00.110 --> 01:43:01.711]  I don't think it would work too well.
[01:43:01.791 --> 01:43:12.177]  Actually, I can tell you that at the last discussion with the Commander of the Air Force, that now is the Chief of Staff, who is leading all this stupid and crazy war.
[01:43:12.917 --> 01:43:18.580]  In the last interview that I had with him, after I published the letter with my friends,
[01:43:19.435 --> 01:43:23.518]  I told him that I don't want him just to discharge me from the Air Force.
[01:43:23.638 --> 01:43:25.520]  I want him to charge us, to charge me.
[01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:32.184]  And we are willing even to sit in jail if they can show in court that these orders are legal.
[01:43:32.745 --> 01:43:33.705]  And of course they didn't want to.
[01:43:33.745 --> 01:43:39.169]  They didn't want the bad publicity is really what I think probably what it amounted to and maybe not a bad decision on their part.
[01:43:39.209 --> 01:43:40.290]  Thanks for the call, Wolfgang.
[01:43:40.490 --> 01:43:42.632]  Let's go to Zach who's calling from Arkansas.
[01:43:42.852 --> 01:43:43.852]  Zach, thank you for calling.
[01:43:43.872 --> 01:43:44.853]  You're on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:43:45.314 --> 01:43:46.594]  Hi, I was going to ask
[01:43:47.555 --> 01:43:57.107]  Do you feel that the Hezbollah and the other resistance organizations are legitimate, or do you feel that they are just plain terrorist organizations, or is it somewhere in between there?
[01:43:59.449 --> 01:44:04.015]  Yeah, I don't think that it's legitimate to fire missiles on civilians.
[01:44:04.762 --> 01:44:15.551]  And to kill people in the border, but I think that the same insanity and the same illegitimacy you can find in both sides of this line.
[01:44:15.812 --> 01:44:31.265]  I think that's why I think that there is a chance for dialogue because I know the Israelis are insane and I know that if they are acting like that and the Hezbollah are acting like that
[01:44:32.197 --> 01:44:38.618]  There is a chance that eventually we can sit down and discuss these things without shooting and killing each other.
[01:44:38.738 --> 01:44:56.302]  I think that what Zack was getting at is are they controlled opposition or are they, I guess, a legitimate actual terror force that needs to be dealt with and negotiated with or are they infiltrated either by Shin Bet, by the Mossad, by foreign intelligence to the point where this is all kind of part of the plan?
[01:44:57.270 --> 01:45:09.911]  You know, I think that history taught us that the best way to deal with groups who are violent and use terror against civilians is to talk with them and to make them legitimate.
[01:45:10.552 --> 01:45:14.613]  And then they, most of the time, withdraw from their terrorist means.
[01:45:14.873 --> 01:45:25.895]  You understand we can't talk to Al-Qaeda in a serious way because they're still generally being directed by the Central Intelligence Agency, so it doesn't help us to talk to someone who we already control.
[01:45:25.915 --> 01:45:34.937]  Yeah, but there is a difference between not talking to someone, then bombing civilians that live next by, and making them join the Hezbollah.
[01:45:35.337 --> 01:45:36.798]  I'm against the Hezbollah action.
[01:45:36.818 --> 01:45:38.060]  I'm against their policy.
[01:45:38.100 --> 01:45:42.383]  I'm against this radical and fanatic agenda and opinions.
[01:45:43.004 --> 01:45:54.333]  But at the same time, I think that killing innocent people that live next to this commandership of the Hezbollah will just make more people join the Hezbollah and eventually attacking Israel.
[01:45:54.473 --> 01:45:55.494]  Yeah, I agree with that.
[01:45:55.514 --> 01:45:56.835]  In fact, I agree with everything you just said.
[01:45:56.895 --> 01:45:57.956]  Thank you for the call, Zach.
[01:45:57.996 --> 01:45:59.598]  Let's go to Paula in Florida.
[01:45:59.658 --> 01:46:00.919]  Paula, thank you for calling in.
[01:46:01.139 --> 01:46:03.401]  You're on the Alex Jones Show with Yonatan Shapira.
[01:46:03.948 --> 01:46:04.608]  Yeah, hi hon.
[01:46:05.449 --> 01:46:06.649]  Y'all are doing a wonderful thing.
[01:46:07.530 --> 01:46:12.993]  I just wanted to say that this is very sad that this is happening because we're killing our own family.
[01:46:13.933 --> 01:46:30.202]  And I mean, I've talked to some of the people with the Jewish centers and stuff and they said that a lot of this is being caused from jealousy from the other side of our family that they they feel like we have more than they do that we developed ourselves they haven't
[01:46:30.731 --> 01:46:34.292]  But I mean, this is so sad, but this battle's been going on for a long time.
[01:46:34.912 --> 01:46:37.353]  I mean, ever since Esau and Jacob, and this is exactly what's happening.
[01:46:38.214 --> 01:46:42.015]  And it's sad, but I'll tell you, there's a lot of sick people out there.
[01:46:42.035 --> 01:46:47.777]  I mean, we have intermarried our own families for over 2,000 years, and we have the highest level of mental insanity in the world.
[01:46:48.857 --> 01:46:50.438]  And I think this is part of our problem that
[01:46:50.796 --> 01:46:52.657]  Some of these people are not mentally stable.
[01:46:52.958 --> 01:46:55.039]  It's the inbreeding, Paula, is that what you're saying?
[01:46:55.059 --> 01:47:05.728]  Yeah, I've got some information on this that I got, and it said that we were told to intermarry until a certain time, until the time of Charlotte, but they said because of this, we have the highest level of mental instability.
[01:47:05.748 --> 01:47:12.633]  So you think that maybe George Herbert Walker Bush shouldn't have married his cousin Barbara Pierce and had children, and maybe that's part of the problem?
[01:47:13.324 --> 01:47:15.046]  Yeah, cause GW's on medication too.
[01:47:15.106 --> 01:47:15.667]  He's mentally ill.
[01:47:16.007 --> 01:47:17.088]  He is mentally ill!
[01:47:17.229 --> 01:47:18.550]  Yeah, he's got, he's mad depressive.
[01:47:18.830 --> 01:47:21.773]  Ariel Sharon is, uh, well, they took care of him.
[01:47:21.853 --> 01:47:23.035]  Thank you for the call, Paul.
[01:47:23.075 --> 01:47:27.760]  You know guys, it's too easy solution to say that these guys are ill.
[01:47:27.800 --> 01:47:28.120]  Hold on, Paul.
[01:47:28.140 --> 01:47:28.981]  It's too easy for us.
[01:47:29.648 --> 01:47:30.609]  I'm sorry, go ahead Jonathan.
[01:47:30.929 --> 01:47:38.293]  I think it's much too easy just to say that these guys are just insane and in a mental condition.
[01:47:38.313 --> 01:47:39.573]  Well, that's not all we're saying.
[01:47:39.814 --> 01:47:41.955]  Yeah, we are all part of it.
[01:47:42.035 --> 01:47:46.397]  You know, each one of us who is now part of the system here or there is part of it.
[01:47:46.697 --> 01:47:49.039]  So we cannot just blame the insane leaders.
[01:47:49.519 --> 01:47:53.581]  I don't consider myself part of it and I doubt Paula considers herself part of it.
[01:47:53.601 --> 01:47:54.141]  Paula, go ahead.
[01:47:54.181 --> 01:47:55.562]  You wanted to finish up real quick?
[01:47:55.602 --> 01:47:56.663]  I just talked to one of the congressmen.
[01:47:56.683 --> 01:47:58.143]  They've got some papers on this new union.
[01:47:59.261 --> 01:48:00.502]  They're going to mail me a copy of it.
[01:48:01.043 --> 01:48:01.483]  Very good.
[01:48:01.523 --> 01:48:03.405]  You let us know what you find out.
[01:48:03.765 --> 01:48:05.026]  Okay, and the impeachment's going through.
[01:48:05.587 --> 01:48:08.669]  Well, we can hope so, but I don't know if that's going to solve anything.
[01:48:08.709 --> 01:48:11.252]  I mean, we're going to get one crook in place of another.
[01:48:11.272 --> 01:48:14.755]  Okay, let's go to Joy, calling from Hawaii.
[01:48:14.875 --> 01:48:16.096]  Joy, thank you for joining us.
[01:48:16.116 --> 01:48:17.257]  You're on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:48:17.777 --> 01:48:18.358]  Oh, thank you.
[01:48:18.378 --> 01:48:23.182]  I'm just sitting here listening to all of the conversations, and I thought, what a novel idea.
[01:48:23.322 --> 01:48:26.265]  Peace equals peace, as opposed to war equals peace.
[01:48:27.097 --> 01:48:29.779]  You can't fight for peace, you have to peace for peace.
[01:48:30.060 --> 01:48:30.380]  Right.
[01:48:31.601 --> 01:48:35.244]  Well, the reason I'm calling is you know how these globalists work.
[01:48:35.344 --> 01:48:48.675]  In our local newspaper, about a week ago, there was an article showing that Hawaii plans to hold an exercise in mid-August simulating the explosion of a half-kiloton nuclear device at the entrance of Honolulu Harbor.
[01:48:49.115 --> 01:48:54.800]  And this is going to be a mock blast that theoretically would result in 10,000 casualties.
[01:48:54.880 --> 01:48:55.821]  When is that taking place?
[01:48:56.343 --> 01:48:58.285]  That's supposed to take place in mid-August.
[01:48:59.206 --> 01:49:01.488]  Yeah, I remember covering that a while back.
[01:49:01.528 --> 01:49:03.090]  They've been planning this for a long time.
[01:49:03.631 --> 01:49:09.657]  Alright, so you know how their mock drills turn out to be the real thing?
[01:49:09.697 --> 01:49:19.487]  Well, they use these drills in order to disguise false flag operations, and we've seen that in every instance in the most recent terror attacks around the world, or quote-unquote terror attacks.
[01:49:20.320 --> 01:49:32.064]  We're keeping our eye on you, Joy, over there, and I think that if you get the word out to people that you're having this drill and that people use these drills to cover for false flag operations, maybe you'll scare them off from maybe doing something.
[01:49:32.524 --> 01:49:34.544]  So you mean a false flag here in Hawaii?
[01:49:34.745 --> 01:49:36.265]  Well, it's a potential, as you say.
[01:49:36.545 --> 01:49:37.365]  They're running a drill.
[01:49:37.565 --> 01:49:40.666]  I'd let people know what they do during these drills, Joy.
[01:49:40.946 --> 01:49:44.688]  And we've scared them off, I think, in the past by publishing that type of information.
[01:49:45.508 --> 01:49:47.889]  Stop them from doing things that they might normally do.
[01:49:47.909 --> 01:49:48.609]  Stay tuned, folks.
[01:49:48.629 --> 01:49:49.069]  We'll be right back.
[01:49:52.316 --> 01:49:59.138]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[01:49:59.458 --> 01:50:00.838]  That's right folks, DVD.
[01:50:01.018 --> 01:50:03.219]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[01:50:03.379 --> 01:50:05.479]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[01:50:05.740 --> 01:50:10.681]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[01:50:11.021 --> 01:50:15.042]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[01:50:15.302 --> 01:50:17.063]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[01:50:17.143 --> 01:50:27.808]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plannable microchips, and much, much more.
[01:50:27.948 --> 01:50:29.849]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.

[01:51:10.652 --> 01:51:10.952]  Yes, we are!

[01:53:15.930 --> 01:53:27.143]  Yonatan Shapiro with us, former captain of the Israeli Air Force Reserves, military refuser, refused to continue the effort of the bombing of innocent civilians in and around Israel.
[01:53:27.904 --> 01:53:30.907]  Now working with the group combatantsforpeace.org.
[01:53:30.927 --> 01:53:34.371]  I'd like everyone to go there, find out about this organization, and if you can
[01:53:34.691 --> 01:53:37.833]  Book them at an event or you can help them get their message out.
[01:53:38.093 --> 01:53:40.734]  Help them increase their ranks or their funding.
[01:53:41.014 --> 01:53:44.776]  I think that this would be a legitimate organization to support.
[01:53:45.156 --> 01:53:46.416]  Combatants4Peace.org
[01:53:50.058 --> 01:53:51.679]  Yonatan, let me ask you this.
[01:53:52.059 --> 01:54:05.066]  Here in the United States, if we criticize Israel for anything, whether it be the government, whether it be the Zionist leaders, whether it be the military actions, we are instantly called anti-Semitic.
[01:54:05.386 --> 01:54:12.090]  This seems to be a plan that's very well thought out, and this is maybe why Israel seems to be front and center to a lot of the wars and aggression.
[01:54:12.490 --> 01:54:13.751]  How do you think we should deal with that?
[01:54:14.711 --> 01:54:15.852]  I think it's very simple.
[01:54:16.092 --> 01:54:19.354]  Bring as many people like us to the United States
[01:54:20.023 --> 01:54:21.023]  Bring hundreds of us.
[01:54:21.704 --> 01:54:24.165]  No one can say to me that I am anti-Semitic.
[01:54:24.205 --> 01:54:26.666]  No one can say to me that I am anti-Israeli.
[01:54:27.086 --> 01:54:28.127]  I serve my country.
[01:54:28.367 --> 01:54:33.289]  I risk my life for my country, as well as other thousands of people.
[01:54:33.529 --> 01:54:35.190]  And we have thousands of activists.
[01:54:35.717 --> 01:54:43.867]  Bring them on and let them talk to every community, Jewish, American, Christian, Muslim.
[01:54:44.287 --> 01:54:46.510]  Let them talk and listen to them carefully.
[01:54:54.799 --> 01:55:10.011]  of you Israelis on as possible to make the point that again we are all concerned Israeli citizens and American citizens and British citizens and German citizens and French citizens and Russian citizens all alike very concerned for the state of the world.
[01:55:10.331 --> 01:55:15.435]  That being said, we'll put anything on the record that you want here we have just a couple of minutes left.
[01:55:15.475 --> 01:55:16.796]  How do we stop this madness?
[01:55:16.876 --> 01:55:19.298]  What needs to be done to create a ceasefire?
[01:55:19.598 --> 01:55:21.760]  What can we do to stop this escalation?
[01:55:22.498 --> 01:55:26.823]  You know, I think that the United States now will not stop the escalation.
[01:55:28.765 --> 01:55:34.571]  They will probably just give us some more bombs and missiles to shoot.
[01:55:36.012 --> 01:55:41.438]  I guess that we can address our request to European leaders
[01:55:42.074 --> 01:55:48.919]  Maybe to some people in the UN, if the UN will be a bit stronger, and to force the sides to cease fire.
[01:55:49.119 --> 01:55:54.303]  The problem is now that Israel is even refusing to talk to the Lebanese government.
[01:55:54.443 --> 01:56:04.331]  The Lebanese government did not shoot on us, but Israel refused to talk to them because they want to... we want to continue this operation.
[01:56:04.511 --> 01:56:09.154]  So we must force them to cease fire by any non-violent means.
[01:56:09.355 --> 01:56:09.755]  It means
[01:56:10.245 --> 01:56:16.387]  You know, boycott, it means divestment, it means isolating diplomats from Israel.
[01:56:16.927 --> 01:56:21.568]  All these kind of things are legitimate now in order to force them to cease fire.
[01:56:21.949 --> 01:56:24.469]  So you've given up on us here in the United States, Yonatan.
[01:56:24.489 --> 01:56:27.690]  You've completely given up on any hope that the United States could intervene.
[01:56:28.190 --> 01:56:33.492]  No, I didn't completely give up, but when I see the reaction of your leaders now,
[01:56:33.912 --> 01:56:40.579]  I know that it's not something that's going to happen tomorrow or the next day.
[01:56:40.760 --> 01:56:46.726]  And if it will not be stopped tomorrow or the next day, it's very, very dangerous.
[01:56:47.578 --> 01:56:50.040]  And logistically, I think that's almost impossible.
[01:56:50.060 --> 01:57:01.028]  I mean, even if we got millions of people out into the street over this, and I don't think again until Americans are heard, or until we can really start feeling the pain here, I don't know if that's likely to happen.
[01:57:01.048 --> 01:57:02.750]  It's certainly not likely to happen in time.
[01:57:02.930 --> 01:57:04.651]  Will the United States become Tel Aviv?
[01:57:04.691 --> 01:57:09.315]  Will we see terrorist bombs going off every day here in a big city like you do in Tel Aviv?
[01:57:09.735 --> 01:57:10.876]  I think it's already happened.
[01:57:10.896 --> 01:57:11.877]  Don't you think?
[01:57:12.417 --> 01:57:15.059]  Well, no, not to the degree that we see happening in Israel.
[01:57:15.219 --> 01:57:17.161]  Not to this degree, but you already have time.
[01:57:19.055 --> 01:57:19.615]  Yeah.
[01:57:19.935 --> 01:57:22.536]  Yonatan, I appreciate you being with us today.
[01:57:22.616 --> 01:57:24.257]  Again, combatantsforpeace.org.
[01:57:24.297 --> 01:57:28.058]  We're going to open up the phone lines and just take calls for the final hour of today's program.
[01:57:28.078 --> 01:57:29.099]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[01:57:29.119 --> 01:57:31.179]  Yonatan, thank you very much for what you're doing.
[01:57:31.199 --> 01:57:31.880]  Thank you very much, Michael.
[01:57:48.489 --> 01:57:49.130]  Big Brother.
[01:57:49.810 --> 01:57:50.851]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:51.571 --> 01:57:52.692]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:53.333 --> 01:57:54.153]  You want answers?
[01:57:54.894 --> 01:57:55.795]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:55.815 --> 01:58:00.278]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:00.638 --> 01:58:04.762]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:06.363 --> 01:58:07.103]  Well, you heard it.
[01:58:07.243 --> 01:58:13.028]  The former defector from the military in Israel wants to save his country.
[01:58:14.176 --> 01:58:30.527]  Maybe it helps save ours, and even the world, by joining together with others from all sides of this conflict to say they don't want any more war, they don't want any more violence, they're done killing each other, and that there is nothing going on in Israel other than the fact that they are the aggressor.
[01:58:30.547 --> 01:58:32.188]  They're not defending themselves.
[01:58:32.208 --> 01:58:37.712]  This is a fake belief perpetrated and propagandized on the people of Israel.
[01:58:37.752 --> 01:58:42.075]  So really, Yonatan, not much different than the rest of us here in the United States.
[01:58:43.050 --> 01:58:43.910]  Love our country?
[01:58:43.950 --> 01:58:45.251]  Want to defend our country?
[01:58:46.691 --> 01:58:54.614]  It takes you aback a little bit when you really hear somebody like that say, look, there's probably no hope for you guys helping us.
[01:58:55.034 --> 01:58:57.075]  We're just going to have to give up on the United States.
[01:58:57.515 --> 01:59:11.480]  And then you think that throughout this great country, or once great country, there are roughly 50 million people that want to help but are too busy or too distracted or not incensed enough to get out and really do something.
[01:59:11.500 --> 01:59:12.240]  I mean, if we could put
[01:59:12.819 --> 01:59:14.820]  You know, 30 million people on the street.
[01:59:14.840 --> 01:59:17.441]  You remember May Day when we were having immigration protests?
[01:59:17.461 --> 01:59:22.804]  If you could put that many people on the street by tomorrow, you could perhaps turn the tide.
[01:59:22.844 --> 01:59:24.565]  But it has to be done today.
[01:59:24.985 --> 01:59:25.605]  Tomorrow.
[01:59:26.766 --> 01:59:30.768]  No, not the next day after that, or next week, or next month, or next year.
[01:59:30.788 --> 01:59:37.311]  It's shocking to hear and to believe that we're kind of a lost cause here, enablers.
[01:59:38.317 --> 01:59:52.892]  For this Middle East war, and when you hear that Woolsey clip that we played, or you get some of the copy coming out from these policy makers, these pundits, or even these screaming heads all over the radio and the TV, you can understand why people feel that way.
[01:59:53.992 --> 01:59:55.973]  Very, very, very disturbing.
[01:59:56.253 --> 01:59:59.995]  We're going to take your calls for the final hour of the broadcast today.
[02:00:00.115 --> 02:00:06.479]  Anything that you want to talk about, you want to change topics and get out of this Middle East thing, probably more than happy to join you with that.
[02:00:06.499 --> 02:00:20.246]  We've got a lot of information to cover as well, including a news notice from the Associated Press that the IRS is warning churches to avoid campaigning and involving themselves in political activism or political events whatsoever.
[02:00:21.284 --> 02:00:22.765]  Just a lot of information to cover.
[02:00:22.786 --> 02:00:26.629]  The phone line to call in 1-800-259-9231.
[02:00:26.649 --> 02:00:31.313]  I believe we have a line or two open at 1-800-259-9231.
[02:00:31.413 --> 02:00:34.355]  I'm Jack Blood sitting in for Alex Jones.
[02:00:34.395 --> 02:00:37.538]  This is the Alex Jones Show GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:37.558 --> 02:00:42.242]  Quickly, before we go to the phones, let me just again remind you there are specials right now.
[02:00:42.862 --> 02:00:47.164]  enacted for you to get information in order to help wake people up.
[02:00:47.624 --> 02:00:48.925]  You're not the only one.
[02:00:48.965 --> 02:00:53.627]  This is how we've managed to kind of push this proverbial snowball down the hill.
[02:00:53.687 --> 02:00:57.349]  I believe we're getting closer and closer and closer to critical mass.
[02:00:57.389 --> 02:01:01.211]  We've done so because we have documented the information we talk about.
[02:01:01.391 --> 02:01:08.174]  We can back up what we're saying, and as I said earlier in the show, we're generally about two years ahead of the general curve of the media.
[02:01:08.234 --> 02:01:10.255]  We knew there would be no weapons of mass destruction
[02:01:10.615 --> 02:01:11.415]  Way ahead of time.
[02:01:11.456 --> 02:01:14.357]  We knew that the border was a major problem, was going to explode.
[02:01:14.397 --> 02:01:18.979]  We predicted the Pan-American Union or the American Union here in the United States.
[02:01:19.039 --> 02:01:25.282]  We told you years ago that they would be forcing microchips into your arms in order to track and control you.
[02:01:25.342 --> 02:01:31.566]  We told you that the NSA and the CIA were monitoring most of what we've done.
[02:01:31.626 --> 02:01:36.608]  We talked about the Patriot Act and what it might entail very early on.
[02:01:36.628 --> 02:01:38.169]  In fact, days after it was
[02:01:38.789 --> 02:01:41.050]  Signed by our Congress without being read.
[02:01:41.130 --> 02:01:45.072]  So, again, we've gone out of our way to document this information for you.
[02:01:45.552 --> 02:01:48.533]  All of the films by Alex Jones are flawless.
[02:01:48.873 --> 02:01:51.835]  Martial Law, Rise of the Police State, I have a little cameo in that.
[02:01:52.315 --> 02:01:54.156]  A very, very, very good film.
[02:01:54.376 --> 02:02:01.179]  Police State 2000, Police State 3, Total Enslavement, Master of Terror, America Destroyed Out of Design,
[02:02:01.799 --> 02:02:02.880]  All very, very good.
[02:02:02.900 --> 02:02:04.541]  The Police State movies are amazing.
[02:02:04.581 --> 02:02:11.525]  Police State 2, The Takeover, Police State 3, 9-11, Road to Tyranny, still the definitive 9-11 film.
[02:02:11.545 --> 02:02:16.548]  But Terror Storm takes all of that, updates all the information, adds history.
[02:02:16.808 --> 02:02:18.909]  This film is waking people up right now.
[02:02:19.927 --> 02:02:22.749]  Additions are available with Alex Jones' autograph.
[02:02:22.949 --> 02:02:26.011]  I suggest you get those now if you want to get these collector's items.

[02:02:39.961 --> 02:02:41.482]  Jack Blood is sitting in for Alex Jones.
[02:02:41.502 --> 02:02:42.303]  We'll be right back after this.
[02:02:45.057 --> 02:02:52.462]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[02:02:52.702 --> 02:02:57.466]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[02:02:57.686 --> 02:03:03.330]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[02:03:03.570 --> 02:03:08.094]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.

[02:03:15.480 --> 02:03:19.684]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[02:03:20.184 --> 02:03:22.685]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the Masters of Terror.
[02:03:22.926 --> 02:03:29.669]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our Constitutional Republic.

[02:06:19.929 --> 02:06:25.930]  Alex will be back tomorrow full of, you know what, that would be vinegar and something else.
[02:06:26.670 --> 02:06:28.571]  Ready to go after the New World Order at 100%.
[02:06:28.611 --> 02:06:33.272]  And it's just so good to get away from this stuff if you can for a few days.
[02:06:33.672 --> 02:06:35.352]  And I advise all of you to try to do that as well.
[02:06:36.118 --> 02:06:37.119]  Find some hobbies.
[02:06:37.179 --> 02:06:41.321]  Find something you can do so that you're not consumed with this 24 hours a day.
[02:06:41.381 --> 02:06:45.404]  I believe it will destroy you if you don't get away from it every once in a while.
[02:06:45.444 --> 02:06:46.384]  Alex doing just that.
[02:06:46.424 --> 02:06:51.988]  Be back tomorrow on the program at 11 o'clock Central Time.
[02:06:52.008 --> 02:06:52.748]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:06:53.068 --> 02:06:54.389]  Let's go to David in New York.
[02:06:54.429 --> 02:06:55.430]  David, thank you for holding.
[02:06:55.450 --> 02:06:56.430]  You're on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:06:57.391 --> 02:07:00.233]  My question is regarding the missile attacks in northern Israel.
[02:07:00.373 --> 02:07:04.075]  I have a Ynet News report saying that there were at least
[02:07:04.451 --> 02:07:08.915]  Patriot missile and a ballistic missile systems put in place on the 15th.
[02:07:09.775 --> 02:07:11.857]  And then we're seeing missiles hitting the 17th and today.
[02:07:11.877 --> 02:07:14.219]  And there's just been no reports.
[02:07:14.239 --> 02:07:17.501]  Those Patriot missiles, those missile defense shields have never worked very good.
[02:07:17.521 --> 02:07:24.647]  In fact, if you remember in the Iraq War, I believe the first Iraq War, a bunch of those Patriot missiles landed on U.S.
[02:07:24.707 --> 02:07:25.508]  military bases.
[02:07:26.718 --> 02:07:33.699]  That's correct, but you have mainstream Israeli news saying that they're deployed, and we're not seeing any success or failure rates.
[02:07:33.939 --> 02:07:37.640]  Yeah, I don't have any information if they're even using them, to be honest with you.
[02:07:38.360 --> 02:07:38.980]  I really don't.
[02:07:39.040 --> 02:07:48.682]  I mean, basically, what we've found out is the missiles that Hezbollah is allegedly shooting off into Israel are close to what Scuds might be.
[02:07:49.042 --> 02:07:51.563]  Some of them now, I guess, are a little more intelligent.
[02:07:51.963 --> 02:07:57.688]  But they certainly... I don't believe Hezbollah has their own satellites up in space and are able to guide some of these missiles.
[02:07:57.728 --> 02:08:03.514]  So, they're heat-seeking... It sounds like maybe there's a stand-down on the northern defenses of Israel to allow these rockets to go in there.
[02:08:03.854 --> 02:08:04.795]  No, you might have a point.
[02:08:05.615 --> 02:08:06.857]  Honestly, I couldn't tell you.
[02:08:07.277 --> 02:08:09.199]  And I think that's something we probably need to look into.
[02:08:09.279 --> 02:08:10.280]  What are these... You go too long.
[02:08:10.740 --> 02:08:15.881]  If you go to Ynetnews.com, they have an article showing pictures of them hitting missiles in Paipa.
[02:08:16.241 --> 02:08:17.741]  Yeah, no, I mean, I've seen it all over the news.
[02:08:17.781 --> 02:08:19.321]  I don't dispute that they've deployed them.
[02:08:19.441 --> 02:08:23.942]  I just, like you, have questions on whether they're being used and to what capacity they're being used.
[02:08:24.962 --> 02:08:25.683]  Okay, well, thanks a lot.
[02:08:25.743 --> 02:08:26.243]  Thanks, David.
[02:08:26.263 --> 02:08:26.763]  Appreciate the call.
[02:08:26.783 --> 02:08:30.623]  Wish I could have given you an answer there, but we're trying to keep track of a lot of information here.
[02:08:31.083 --> 02:08:32.924]  Let's go to Malta in Denmark.
[02:08:32.984 --> 02:08:33.864]  Hi, Malta, my friend.
[02:08:33.884 --> 02:08:34.224]  How are you?
[02:08:34.244 --> 02:08:35.244]  You're on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:35.364 --> 02:08:36.604]  Brave man, this guy.
[02:08:36.864 --> 02:08:38.825]  He would probably be called a self-hating Jew.
[02:08:38.845 --> 02:08:39.505]  Right.
[02:08:40.365 --> 02:08:42.947]  And if he gets lucky with it, he will probably be killed.
[02:08:43.027 --> 02:08:43.587]  I mean, I know.
[02:08:44.928 --> 02:08:47.409]  Well, I'm sure he's got a pretty big bullseye on his back.
[02:08:47.449 --> 02:08:50.011]  I mean, that's why he's here in the United States.
[02:08:50.631 --> 02:08:58.276]  It seems that if Jewish people are trying to expose the old hidden history of the Kazarian, they're just being killed.
[02:08:58.789 --> 02:09:01.952]  Well look, hold on a second, let me say something.
[02:09:02.452 --> 02:09:13.082]  One of the points that he made is that the new Israeli military are much more up to speed on the information about the history of their government and the history of the world.
[02:09:13.142 --> 02:09:15.284]  And that is again because we have the internet.
[02:09:15.304 --> 02:09:18.507]  That is we have more avenues to share information.
[02:09:18.607 --> 02:09:21.770]  So they're going to have a harder and harder time, much like our
[02:09:22.430 --> 02:09:31.472]  Military does here in the United States and militaries all over the world are going to have a harder and harder time recruiting people for these missions as people begin understanding what real history means.
[02:09:32.693 --> 02:09:36.554]  The problem is, where do you want to place these Israelis?
[02:09:36.574 --> 02:09:39.575]  I mean, I don't think the Russians want them back there.
[02:09:39.735 --> 02:09:40.895]  I don't know their homeland.
[02:09:41.555 --> 02:09:42.715]  They're Qazari and Jew.
[02:09:42.755 --> 02:09:43.616]  They're European.
[02:09:43.636 --> 02:09:44.836]  They're not Arabs.
[02:09:45.076 --> 02:09:47.697]  They have the same rights as you and me.
[02:09:47.717 --> 02:09:48.517]  They're whites.
[02:09:49.560 --> 02:09:57.026]  Well, look, and we understand all of that, but at this point, there's no way we're going to remove the Israeli government.
[02:09:57.086 --> 02:10:04.632]  It is staying there, and merely, I believe that... I believe that, you know, Webster Tarpley touched on this yesterday.
[02:10:04.672 --> 02:10:12.478]  I mean, the original treaties and the original borders need to be honored, and that means people on both sides are going to have to start making some concessions.
[02:10:13.198 --> 02:10:14.199]  Well, what about this one?
[02:10:14.259 --> 02:10:17.862]  Is it really talking about that the Palestinians don't exist?
[02:10:17.902 --> 02:10:19.083]  They're really Euthanians?
[02:10:20.996 --> 02:10:22.240]  I'm sorry I missed that last part.
[02:10:25.803 --> 02:10:26.123]  Sure.
[02:10:26.183 --> 02:10:32.668]  Well, that's propaganda put forth by people on the Israeli side of the conflict, and there's propaganda flying from both sides.
[02:10:32.728 --> 02:10:34.730]  Of course, our job is to cut through that.
[02:10:34.890 --> 02:10:41.795]  The fact of the matter is that the Palestinians have a homeland, the Israelis now have a homeland.
[02:10:42.275 --> 02:10:45.878]  I just don't know where, who's going to remove either one of them.
[02:10:45.918 --> 02:10:47.439]  That's not going to happen.
[02:10:47.479 --> 02:10:48.640]  It's not realistic.
[02:10:49.020 --> 02:10:53.903]  And in the end, we've got to find a way to honor certain borders by certain countries.
[02:10:53.963 --> 02:10:54.524]  That's just it.
[02:10:57.597 --> 02:10:58.657]  Thank you for the call, Molta.
[02:10:58.817 --> 02:11:01.158]  I'm having a hard time understanding you, but we got most of that.
[02:11:01.238 --> 02:11:01.578]  Jim?
[02:11:03.339 --> 02:11:04.299]  Where's Jim from?
[02:11:05.279 --> 02:11:05.919]  Wisconsin.
[02:11:05.939 --> 02:11:08.440]  Jim, I can't read my writing, but you are on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:11:08.460 --> 02:11:09.120]  Thank you for calling.
[02:11:09.520 --> 02:11:10.321]  Yes.
[02:11:10.941 --> 02:11:14.642]  Worldwide, the organized warmongers are the Illuminati.
[02:11:14.782 --> 02:11:21.824]  And Professor John Robinson wrote a book called Proof of a Conspiracy to Destroy All Government and Religion.
[02:11:22.384 --> 02:11:23.785]  And copies are available.
[02:11:24.894 --> 02:11:34.761]  There's a book called Warning 1965 and you get the copy from www.freedomcalendar.com Truth in Print.
[02:11:34.861 --> 02:11:35.902]  Get a copy of this.
[02:11:35.982 --> 02:11:46.509]  It's 31 pages and it shows that way back in history even Thomas Jefferson who founded the Democratic Party was a member of the Illuminati.
[02:11:47.009 --> 02:11:49.131]  And the Illuminati are the warmongers.
[02:11:49.391 --> 02:11:51.172]  So read this documentation.
[02:11:51.292 --> 02:11:52.613]  Proof of a conspiracy.
[02:11:53.240 --> 02:11:54.821]  To destroy all government and religions.
[02:11:54.981 --> 02:11:58.722]  And they infiltrated all governments and religions.
[02:11:59.082 --> 02:12:00.823]  We have a lot of reading to do.
[02:12:00.863 --> 02:12:06.705]  I guess if people read every book or every plug that came out on a show like this, they would do nothing but read 24-7.
[02:12:06.745 --> 02:12:08.645]  But you have a point.
[02:12:08.845 --> 02:12:10.106]  I'm not going to debate it with you.
[02:12:10.386 --> 02:12:11.806]  Let's go to William in Georgia.
[02:12:11.846 --> 02:12:12.767]  William, thank you for the call.
[02:12:12.787 --> 02:12:13.767]  You're on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:12:13.787 --> 02:12:15.728]  Yeah, it's good talking to you.
[02:12:16.567 --> 02:12:20.049]  Yeah, I just want to talk about, like, last night I was watching the news, man.
[02:12:20.089 --> 02:12:23.572]  It's the most wartime propaganda I have ever seen.
[02:12:23.592 --> 02:12:34.419]  The psyops, the numerology, all the tickers, all they talk about is child molestation, child pornography, women killing their children.
[02:12:34.479 --> 02:12:35.380]  It's so sick.
[02:12:36.491 --> 02:12:45.957]  Well, and especially regarding this Middle East conflict, you know, I remember about a month ago, I was screaming for people to get involved, for the news to start covering this.
[02:12:46.037 --> 02:12:52.080]  When the initial bombing started in Lebanon, I couldn't believe that it was hardly being covered on the mainstream news.
[02:12:52.100 --> 02:13:00.586]  Well, I have to be careful what I wish for, because now it's 24-7, and as you say, it's about 99.9% pure propaganda, war propaganda.
[02:13:00.786 --> 02:13:02.707]  Yeah, it's Zionist hogwash.
[02:13:03.683 --> 02:13:10.828]  To deny that that's war propaganda... Globalist, Zionist, Fundamental Christian... I mean, you can give it any name you want.
[02:13:10.848 --> 02:13:12.149]  It seems they're all in on it.
[02:13:12.370 --> 02:13:13.190]  Don't you think, William?
[02:13:13.270 --> 02:13:18.694]  I mean, there are a lot of groups joined together that love everything about more war, don't they?
[02:13:18.995 --> 02:13:19.435]  Oh, yeah.
[02:13:19.815 --> 02:13:22.157]  They just feed off of it like a parasite.
[02:13:23.398 --> 02:13:26.620]  You know, and they use it... I called in and talked about the Egyptian mysteries, man.
[02:13:26.660 --> 02:13:27.661]  It's in full effect.
[02:13:27.821 --> 02:13:28.742]  Just watch the news.
[02:13:30.117 --> 02:13:32.038]  Yeah, the signs are everywhere, as they say.
[02:13:32.398 --> 02:13:35.159]  The truth is not just out there, it's right in front of you.
[02:13:35.939 --> 02:13:37.120]  Thank you for the call, William.
[02:13:37.160 --> 02:13:42.722]  Maybe you've been to the Georgia Guidestones, which is very occultist as well there in Georgia.
[02:13:43.002 --> 02:13:44.702]  Celeste calling in from New Mexico.
[02:13:44.762 --> 02:13:46.963]  Celeste, thank you for calling in on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:13:47.343 --> 02:13:47.883]  Hi, Jack.
[02:13:47.903 --> 02:13:50.404]  You're doing a great job filling in for Alex.
[02:13:50.524 --> 02:13:53.165]  I really appreciate it.
[02:13:53.605 --> 02:13:57.247]  The first thing I wanted to ask you is, you said you have a program right after Alex.
[02:13:58.328 --> 02:14:01.069]  Could you give us where we can find you on the shortwave?
[02:14:01.149 --> 02:14:03.050]  Because we looked yesterday and couldn't find you.
[02:14:03.190 --> 02:14:04.151]  I'm not on shortwave.
[02:14:04.991 --> 02:14:11.975]  You'll have to log on to the internet and just go to Jackblood.com or GCNlive.com and everyone can find my program as well.
[02:14:12.475 --> 02:14:14.276]  Five days a week, right after Alex's show.
[02:14:14.436 --> 02:14:14.976]  Five days a week.
[02:14:14.996 --> 02:14:15.417]  Thank you.
[02:14:15.437 --> 02:14:15.737]  Okay.
[02:14:16.097 --> 02:14:22.040]  What I wanted to say was yesterday I was listening when a Christian called in and was concerned.
[02:14:22.060 --> 02:14:26.802]  He was obviously up to speed on the New World Order and all, but he said he just couldn't back
[02:14:28.944 --> 02:14:29.865]  Going against Israel.
[02:14:29.885 --> 02:14:31.185]  You remember the guy I'm talking about?
[02:14:31.205 --> 02:14:32.566]  Yeah, we had a couple of calls like that.
[02:14:32.606 --> 02:14:54.697]  Yeah, I just heard one, and you know, I'm an evangelical, born-again Christian, however you want to call it, and I came from that same tradition where, you know, Israel, you back them no matter what, and that they are the true people of God and all, but I want to speak to the Christians that are listening that we know that in the end times, there's going to be great deception.
[02:14:55.624 --> 02:14:59.167]  And Jesus said, blessed are the peacemakers, first of all.
[02:14:59.227 --> 02:15:04.031]  We've got to decide and discern what's really peace and what's really not.
[02:15:04.812 --> 02:15:07.635]  Aren't we supposed to love our neighbors?
[02:15:07.675 --> 02:15:09.016]  I mean, whatever happened to that?
[02:15:09.036 --> 02:15:16.342]  That doesn't seem... all these Christians or Jews that believe in the Old Testament, I mean, where is the love your neighbor here?
[02:15:17.003 --> 02:15:21.627]  And I think that Christians really need to... Yes, we are to pray for the peace of Jerusalem.
[02:15:21.667 --> 02:15:23.148]  That's obviously in the scripture.
[02:15:23.578 --> 02:15:29.945]  But we need to ask the Lord to give us discernment on, you know, who are these people?
[02:15:30.325 --> 02:15:35.150]  We know they're the government, and are they who Jesus was talking about?
[02:15:35.191 --> 02:15:36.432]  Are they who the Bible's talking about?
[02:15:36.452 --> 02:15:37.053]  You know what I'm saying?
[02:15:37.073 --> 02:15:40.336]  These are basically the equivalent of, potentially, the Pharisees.
[02:15:40.356 --> 02:15:41.197]  Do you see it that way?
[02:15:41.357 --> 02:15:42.799]  Absolutely!
[02:15:43.359 --> 02:15:45.001]  Who has hijacked Israel?
[02:15:46.072 --> 02:15:46.812]  Yeah.
[02:15:47.052 --> 02:15:50.233]  And we see that we have that same problem with our country.
[02:15:50.373 --> 02:15:51.894]  You know, who's really in charge?
[02:15:51.954 --> 02:15:54.394]  Well, we know the answer to who hijacked Israel.
[02:15:54.434 --> 02:15:55.615]  It's in the history books.
[02:15:55.675 --> 02:16:06.378]  I mean, this is a direct creation from the Bank of Rothschild, from the British royalty and some of the long-standing globalist powers that have been around now for hundreds of years.
[02:16:06.778 --> 02:16:08.118]  This was all part of the plan.
[02:16:08.138 --> 02:16:11.999]  In fact, they tried to do this with the League of Nations after the First World War.
[02:16:12.059 --> 02:16:12.640]  It failed.
[02:16:12.680 --> 02:16:13.640]  They couldn't get it done.
[02:16:13.980 --> 02:16:18.301]  And that's of course, and a lot of people believe this, this is why the Second World War was really fought.
[02:16:18.341 --> 02:16:23.202]  To redraw the maps of the world, including the Middle East and the homeland for Israel.
[02:16:23.643 --> 02:16:23.843]  Right.
[02:16:23.863 --> 02:16:24.923]  I agree with you totally.
[02:16:25.839 --> 02:16:32.142]  I just wanted to, you said this was a worldwide forum, and I just want to speak to Christians to go to the Lord and seek wisdom.
[02:16:32.202 --> 02:16:35.583]  You know, it says in James, if you lack wisdom, ask for it.
[02:16:36.024 --> 02:16:41.066]  And so we as Christians need to know exactly who we're praying for, who we're backing,
[02:16:41.471 --> 02:16:45.292]  And most of all, remember that Jesus did say, blessed are the peacemakers.
[02:16:45.352 --> 02:16:45.753]  That's right.
[02:16:45.773 --> 02:16:46.573]  Thank you, Celeste.
[02:16:46.873 --> 02:16:57.357]  It sounds like you found that wisdom, but I believe some of our listeners, even after hearing an Israeli on the air today, standing up for his country, much like we do here in America as patriots,
[02:16:58.212 --> 02:17:04.596]  People still doubting, people still looking for discernment, still not being able to find that wisdom.
[02:17:04.636 --> 02:17:08.979]  And if you can pray for it or meditate for it or buy it, please hurry up.
[02:17:09.439 --> 02:17:11.321]  Joe in Boston, thank you for calling in.
[02:17:11.341 --> 02:17:12.381]  You're on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:17:12.561 --> 02:17:13.102]  How are you doing?
[02:17:13.122 --> 02:17:14.603]  I haven't spoken to you for quite a while.
[02:17:14.623 --> 02:17:16.764]  I'm the fellow that you were supposed to help get back to me.
[02:17:16.784 --> 02:17:17.264]  You've never been.
[02:17:17.304 --> 02:17:18.185]  I guess you've been so busy.
[02:17:18.645 --> 02:17:21.188]  Boy, you don't know how true that is.
[02:17:21.428 --> 02:17:25.933]  I'll tell you what, Joe, hang over in the break and I'll give you ample time on the other side of this commercial break, okay?
[02:17:26.053 --> 02:17:26.474]  Okay, great.
[02:17:26.674 --> 02:17:28.776]  Folks, whatever you do, go somewhere else.
[02:17:28.856 --> 02:17:29.737]  Change the channel.
[02:17:29.818 --> 02:17:30.598]  Don't stay there.
[02:17:30.658 --> 02:17:33.942]  No matter what you do, we're going to play this bush clip coming up in the next segment.
[02:17:34.142 --> 02:17:35.283]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[02:17:35.324 --> 02:17:36.605]  Jack Blood sitting in for Alex Jones.
[02:17:36.905 --> 02:17:37.786]  Infowars.com.
[02:17:37.806 --> 02:17:38.887]  PrisonPlanet.com.

[02:18:45.188 --> 02:18:50.531]  Here it is, folks, the 2006 Red Book, the most comprehensive edition ever published.

[02:19:06.493 --> 02:19:08.014]  They are instruments of death.

[02:19:44.381 --> 02:19:47.663]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[02:19:47.723 --> 02:19:51.906]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[02:19:52.146 --> 02:19:54.927]  But, if you place them on the magnet, all would stick.
[02:19:55.128 --> 02:19:57.529]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[02:19:57.709 --> 02:20:06.354]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[02:20:06.555 --> 02:20:07.895]  The Berkeley Light is different.
[02:20:08.095 --> 02:20:12.278]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path

[02:21:50.836 --> 02:21:53.099]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:21:57.199 --> 02:22:00.180]  We have guided missiles and misguided men.
[02:22:00.200 --> 02:22:05.542]  Those said Martin Luther King many years ago before they shot him down like a dog.
[02:22:07.243 --> 02:22:08.484]  Yeah, where are our leaders?
[02:22:08.564 --> 02:22:13.346]  Where are our charismatic leaders who are leading us in the right direction?
[02:22:13.386 --> 02:22:14.946]  Have they all been assassinated?
[02:22:14.986 --> 02:22:16.767]  They've all been Paul Wellstone?
[02:22:17.888 --> 02:22:19.508]  They've all been Vince Fostered?
[02:22:20.148 --> 02:22:21.549]  They've all been Gary Webbed?
[02:22:22.169 --> 02:22:23.410]  Or Hunter S. Thompson'd?
[02:22:25.451 --> 02:22:26.071]  That's for sure.
[02:22:27.884 --> 02:22:36.395]  You know, I think a lot of people are really starting to believe that there's nothing to gain by being a leader of a freedom movement or of a peace movement.
[02:22:36.455 --> 02:22:40.440]  Nothing but trouble will come of that, and everybody trying to get out there and get theirs.
[02:22:40.840 --> 02:22:44.424]  Yes, we've heard the expression, those with the most toys win.
[02:22:47.191 --> 02:22:57.266]  Of course we know that this is not true and something you really learn when you get involved with all of this and you get involved with all the activism that we are ceaselessly doing.
[02:22:58.241 --> 02:23:18.751]  You really learn the value of freedom, that there's nothing that can be placed higher than freedom, the freedom of human consciousness, the freedom of our children and our grandchildren to live without being constantly monitored, without being thrown into camps for being dissident or sent off to the front lines to some war for profit or for power.
[02:23:19.924 --> 02:23:28.581]  So I'll tell you that the mantle of this country, or whatever country you're listening to this broadcast in, rests surely on your shoulders.
[02:23:29.187 --> 02:23:31.067]  This is a very important time in history.
[02:23:31.347 --> 02:23:32.748]  We've got to make the call.
[02:23:32.788 --> 02:23:34.468]  We've got to get out and get active.
[02:23:34.848 --> 02:23:36.548]  And it's not enough just to talk about this.
[02:23:36.589 --> 02:23:38.149]  It's not enough just to know about it.
[02:23:38.429 --> 02:23:42.390]  It's not enough just to, you know, send emails to your friends about this.
[02:23:42.450 --> 02:23:43.990]  So that's a start in the right direction.
[02:23:44.010 --> 02:23:48.131]  But we really need to put people out where it's going to do the most good.
[02:23:48.171 --> 02:23:58.913]  And I tell you, in any given town, in this city, in the United States of America, or in the world at large, if you can get a thousand people together in a coalition and agree on some very simple things,
[02:23:59.213 --> 02:24:08.580]  And you can get those thousand people on a pinpoint like a laser beam on the front porch of some of these policy makers, you can begin to see change.
[02:24:09.221 --> 02:24:12.243]  And that has been proven over and over and over again.
[02:24:12.263 --> 02:24:13.624]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:24:14.865 --> 02:24:17.527]  John, how long is that bush clip?
[02:24:19.969 --> 02:24:21.070]  You have no idea?
[02:24:22.151 --> 02:24:23.131]  I'll tell you what we'll do.
[02:24:23.151 --> 02:24:26.194]  You tell me in the next break and we'll play it in the next segment coming up.
[02:24:26.234 --> 02:24:27.655]  The long segment we have at the
[02:24:29.178 --> 02:24:29.278]  Uh, 1.30.
[02:24:30.018 --> 02:24:30.539]  Oh, okay.
[02:24:30.559 --> 02:24:33.259]  So that's not very long at all.
[02:24:33.339 --> 02:24:35.640]  We'll play that in the next segment for people who haven't heard it.
[02:24:35.720 --> 02:24:36.841]  It's pretty revealing.
[02:24:37.201 --> 02:24:43.062]  We can see... I think what this clip really shows is that President Bush really believes that he's president and he's in control!
[02:24:43.603 --> 02:24:44.883]  He actually believes that!
[02:24:45.778 --> 02:24:50.321]  And Tony Blair is as subservient to Bush as one could possibly be.
[02:24:50.341 --> 02:24:52.142]  If nothing else, the clip shows that.
[02:24:52.182 --> 02:24:55.285]  And in some ways, you have to actually look at it and see the body language.
[02:24:55.365 --> 02:24:59.467]  I saw it last night on Keith Olbermann's show.
[02:24:59.487 --> 02:24:59.547]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:24:59.587 --> 02:25:01.128]  Joe in Boston, let's bring you back up.
[02:25:01.168 --> 02:25:02.069]  Joe, thank you for calling in.
[02:25:02.089 --> 02:25:02.930]  You're on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:25:03.190 --> 02:25:03.870]  Hi, Jack.
[02:25:03.890 --> 02:25:10.775]  Before I make my comments, I hope sometime you will get time and you will do shows on people like me with a visual impairment, because we're left behind.
[02:25:11.198 --> 02:25:13.418]  As you know, we're in the... We're not leaving you behind.
[02:25:13.678 --> 02:25:14.999]  I know, but you know what I mean.
[02:25:15.039 --> 02:25:16.859]  The world doesn't accept... a lot of people don't accept us.
[02:25:17.279 --> 02:25:21.040]  Property, equipment's built for us is sloppy, and I go on and on and on.
[02:25:21.420 --> 02:25:24.820]  But don't forget Nicholas Vegas, his father, the congressman, has been killed too.
[02:25:25.741 --> 02:25:26.681]  I don't understand this.
[02:25:27.021 --> 02:25:32.182]  I mean, I'm glad that... Yeah, he got killed, the airplane got shot down with the Speaker of the House, Hale Boggs.
[02:25:32.442 --> 02:25:35.402]  Yeah, and the TWA 800 I heard last night on the Coast Show.
[02:25:35.422 --> 02:25:36.582]  There's a lot of things about that.
[02:25:36.602 --> 02:25:39.823]  But what I don't understand, and I like this guest who was on... I missed the first part.
[02:25:40.834 --> 02:25:46.369]  They say that Israel is retaliating because Hezbollah or Lebanon...
[02:25:46.949 --> 02:25:47.890]  Hiding the terrorists.
[02:25:47.910 --> 02:25:51.112]  It's like they know something was going on, but they're not doing anything.
[02:25:51.152 --> 02:25:54.534]  Initially it was because one of their soldiers was kidnapped.
[02:25:54.554 --> 02:25:58.856]  That's what started the massive offensive into the West Bank and into Palestine.
[02:25:58.896 --> 02:26:01.618]  And then two more of their soldiers were kidnapped.
[02:26:01.658 --> 02:26:04.860]  And that immediately started a retaliation against Lebanon and Beirut.
[02:26:04.880 --> 02:26:06.761]  I mean, let's remember how this whole thing started.
[02:26:06.841 --> 02:26:12.624]  Yes, after the bombing begun throughout Lebanon, Hezbollah fired back a lot of missiles.
[02:26:12.704 --> 02:26:13.525]  Now it is war.
[02:26:13.745 --> 02:26:15.346]  It's war and both sides are shooting.
[02:26:16.027 --> 02:26:19.751]  Because, well, didn't he say that if you are part of the system, you have a responsibility?
[02:26:19.771 --> 02:26:25.276]  Like, if you know something is going on, someone told me this, you could be an accessory if you don't do anything about it.
[02:26:25.296 --> 02:26:25.536]  That's true.
[02:26:25.896 --> 02:26:28.699]  So is that partially Lebanon's fault that this happened?
[02:26:29.512 --> 02:26:31.654]  I think everybody's guilty in this case.
[02:26:31.694 --> 02:26:51.386]  But again, something I was trying to get through to Yontan, and maybe he doesn't have as much of a grip on history as some of you might have, or some in this audience might have, or Alex Jones or myself, but when we're looking at Hamas and Hezbollah, we know that every terrorist organization on the face of the earth was funded into existence as controlled opposition.
[02:26:52.026 --> 02:27:04.156]  So when we're saying both sides are doing this, we have to remember the leaders are most likely still being controlled some way or another, some shape or form, by these globalists.
[02:27:04.196 --> 02:27:17.567]  The very same people that steal our liberties here in this country, the very same people that are responsible for 9-11, that are responsible for Oklahoma City, that set the policy that allows something like Waco or Ruby Ridge to happen, and events like this to happen all around the world.
[02:27:18.808 --> 02:27:19.048]  I see.
[02:27:20.327 --> 02:27:21.168]  Joe, love you buddy.
[02:27:21.408 --> 02:27:21.968]  Keep the faith.
[02:27:21.988 --> 02:27:22.448]  We'll come back.
[02:27:22.488 --> 02:27:25.210]  Take Tom, George, Les, and Ruth and others patiently holding.
[02:27:25.230 --> 02:27:25.530]  Stay tuned.
[02:27:25.550 --> 02:27:27.772]  This is the Alex Jones Show, GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:34.776 --> 02:27:35.657]  We're on the march.
[02:27:36.157 --> 02:27:37.758]  The empire's on the run.
[02:27:38.679 --> 02:27:41.361]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:45.106 --> 02:27:47.448]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here with an important question.
[02:27:47.688 --> 02:27:49.730]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[02:27:49.870 --> 02:27:56.935]  I mean real hard to find all natural pure soap that contains no dyes, perfumes, deodorants, detergents, or other dangerous toxins.
[02:27:57.175 --> 02:28:05.722]  The Calvin Pure Soap Company, for the past 57 years, has been making triple concentrated pure soaps exclusively for healthcare professionals and hospitals.
[02:28:05.862 --> 02:28:06.082]  Yes!

[02:28:44.463 --> 02:28:46.424]  You've asked for them and now they're here!
[02:28:46.524 --> 02:28:57.229]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Lights Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[02:28:57.609 --> 02:29:02.131]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem with a Black Berkey Purification Element.
[02:29:02.191 --> 02:29:13.536]  When used, water flows through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, Radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul tastes and odors are separated from the water.
[02:29:14.116 --> 02:29:20.963]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements, where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[02:29:21.363 --> 02:29:23.505]  Your purified water is now ready!
[02:29:23.985 --> 02:29:28.950]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 host filter elements.

[02:30:19.175 --> 02:30:19.695]  We're good to go.
[02:30:50.209 --> 02:31:01.502]  All right, we're going to go back to your calls.
[02:31:01.522 --> 02:31:07.109]  We're going to play this clip, the open mic session with Tony Blair, Vladimir Putin,
[02:31:08.172 --> 02:31:13.236]  And George W. Bush from the G8 meeting just, I believe, yesterday, the day before yesterday.
[02:31:13.276 --> 02:31:16.358]  Just real quick, some news coming in from the New York Post.
[02:31:16.838 --> 02:31:19.160]  Perlstein to leave time for Carlisle.
[02:31:19.240 --> 02:31:30.807]  Former Time Incorporated editor-in-chief Norman Perlstein will sever ties to the parent company after Labor Day to become a senior advisor to the Carlisle Group, the global buyout firm.
[02:31:30.827 --> 02:31:32.849]  I love global buyout firm.
[02:31:32.869 --> 02:31:34.390]  I think that's very well put.
[02:31:34.930 --> 02:31:51.719]  Carlisle, which recently was a part of the winning consortium that bought VNU, owner of Nielsen Media Research and The Hollywood Reporter, and also owns Lowe's Cinemas, by the way, are now interested in stepping up its media activity.
[02:31:52.119 --> 02:32:00.364]  It currently has $41.9 billion under management and is interested in expanding and publishing TV and new media.
[02:32:00.404 --> 02:32:02.325]  This is very much like Berlusconi
[02:32:03.105 --> 02:32:05.586]  And various dictators around the world.
[02:32:05.606 --> 02:32:09.207]  They own the military, they own the media, they own everything!
[02:32:09.307 --> 02:32:20.769]  And thanks to the ex-president's club and the influence they wield, the Carlyle Group soon to own most of TV and print media and the internet as well as film.
[02:32:21.450 --> 02:32:27.531]  Pearlstein became the senior advisor to Time Warner in January after 11 years in the firm's top editorial job.
[02:32:28.591 --> 02:32:37.218]  It goes on to say, Time Incorporated remains the world's biggest magazine publisher, thanks in part by a $1.6 billion purchase by IPC.
[02:32:37.238 --> 02:32:54.752]  But here you go, Norman Perlstein now joining the Carlyle Group, the global buyout firm, who by the way, create a situation where they ruin companies, then go in and buy them very cheaply and very low, and the next thing you know, they're making all kinds of money hand over foot.
[02:32:54.792 --> 02:32:56.654]  They actually borrow money, much like
[02:32:57.276 --> 02:33:07.162]  This was also part of the investigations into the 60s, into the labor money being loaned to the mafia in order to make financial investments.
[02:33:07.903 --> 02:33:10.304]  This is very similar to what the Carlyle Group does.
[02:33:10.324 --> 02:33:24.433]  They borrow extensively from Texas pension funds in order to get the capital together to buy these ruined companies, which they themselves had a hand in ruining, and then of course create this global consortium, whether it be media, whether it be military,
[02:33:25.522 --> 02:33:30.504]  Whether it be security folks, the Carlyle Group generally has their fingers in the pie.
[02:33:30.524 --> 02:33:30.944]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:33:30.964 --> 02:33:34.225]  I'm going to go back to the phones here briefly.
[02:33:34.505 --> 02:33:37.146]  Tom in Arizona, thank you for calling here on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:37.426 --> 02:33:39.686]  Well, thanks for taking my phone call and you're doing a great job.
[02:33:40.026 --> 02:33:42.987]  Hey, I wanted to just comment on a couple of things that you had said.
[02:33:43.648 --> 02:33:45.608]  One, about Alex Jones getting away.
[02:33:47.169 --> 02:33:51.090]  Doing what we're doing and all the listeners, we listen to it day in and day out.
[02:33:51.730 --> 02:33:54.851]  It really can become all-consuming and I find myself just
[02:33:55.748 --> 02:33:56.011]  Oh, um...
[02:33:56.795 --> 02:34:00.858]  Running the gamut of all emotions from anger to frustration to everything.
[02:34:00.878 --> 02:34:01.498]  And you really do.
[02:34:01.558 --> 02:34:02.099]  At least I do.
[02:34:02.139 --> 02:34:03.459]  I need to step away every once in a while.
[02:34:03.480 --> 02:34:04.560]  You've got to decompress, you know.
[02:34:05.001 --> 02:34:07.922]  After I get off the air every day, I spend some time with my family.
[02:34:07.942 --> 02:34:09.043]  I play with my son.
[02:34:09.363 --> 02:34:10.584]  We play out in the backyard.
[02:34:10.624 --> 02:34:11.605]  We just do some things.
[02:34:11.645 --> 02:34:12.926]  We do a little kickboxing.
[02:34:12.986 --> 02:34:15.247]  I'm training him to be a young tiger.
[02:34:15.588 --> 02:34:17.669]  You know, we do some family-oriented things.
[02:34:17.729 --> 02:34:18.850]  I get my mind off it.
[02:34:18.870 --> 02:34:22.612]  Sometimes I watch a bread and circus sporting event or something.
[02:34:22.632 --> 02:34:24.554]  And then I go back to work till four in the morning.
[02:34:24.594 --> 02:34:26.635]  But you've got to have some way to decompress.
[02:34:27.715 --> 02:34:33.497]  Anyway, I wanted to make one comment about 9-11 and the Israeli conflict that's going on.
[02:34:35.018 --> 02:34:40.499]  There's been a couple of fellas on Fox News lately, like Jim Fetzer, and I forget the other fella who was just on.
[02:34:41.479 --> 02:34:43.620]  They're trying to make him look like fools.
[02:34:44.160 --> 02:34:54.243]  I would love to see one of those guys, even if you're asked on sometime, or anybody, just to say, hey Hannity, we know you're a good Catholic and a very charitable guy.
[02:34:54.323 --> 02:34:55.904]  How about we do something for charity?
[02:34:57.989 --> 02:35:09.197]  I'll put up X amount of dollars and put it to your charity if you can find any evidence, put it on your website, put it on your show of a plane going into the Pentagon or whatever.
[02:35:09.658 --> 02:35:10.598]  Let's do it for charity, Sean.
[02:35:14.702 --> 02:35:15.902]  And really put their feet to the fire.
[02:35:15.922 --> 02:35:17.723]  Probably not a bad suggestion, though.
[02:35:17.743 --> 02:35:23.624]  He'll begin to tell you all the great charitable things he does and why he doesn't need you to help him with his charities.
[02:35:23.664 --> 02:35:27.224]  I mean, I'm sure he'd find a way out of that, but at least, hey, put his feet to the fire.
[02:35:27.264 --> 02:35:28.664]  It's like they put his hooves to the fire.
[02:35:29.084 --> 02:35:29.285]  Right.
[02:35:29.605 --> 02:35:40.206]  And have you ever seen, obviously we all know that planes went into the World Trade Center, but have you ever seen a photograph that actually can show identification of that plane?
[02:35:40.266 --> 02:35:43.827]  Like, you know, a United logo or whoever?
[02:35:45.006 --> 02:35:49.087]  Well, I don't know if I've seen any exact tail numbers.
[02:35:49.127 --> 02:35:50.808]  I believe those pictures are out there.
[02:35:50.828 --> 02:35:59.410]  To be honest with you, I think I've analyzed thousands of pictures about the events of 9-11, and sometimes it gets a little jumbled in my head.
[02:35:59.490 --> 02:36:00.710]  But thanks for reminding me.
[02:36:03.206 --> 02:36:11.533]  Yeah, I don't want to promote websites here on this program, but if you listen to my show and you ask that question again, I can give you a couple of websites that might actually clarify that for you.
[02:36:11.693 --> 02:36:11.973]  Okay?
[02:36:12.273 --> 02:36:12.514]  Okay.
[02:36:12.734 --> 02:36:14.315]  That's a good question though, Tom.
[02:36:14.395 --> 02:36:18.338]  And look, there are a lot of people, thousands of people out there analyzing this stuff.
[02:36:18.398 --> 02:36:22.582]  And believe me, if there was something to be heard, it would be getting out right now.
[02:36:22.842 --> 02:36:26.924]  Hey, quickly, before I go to Georgia and Pennsylvania, I want you to hear this George W. Bush clip.
[02:36:27.064 --> 02:36:27.444]  Off mic.
[02:36:27.524 --> 02:36:28.804]  Caught off mic.
[02:36:28.884 --> 02:36:30.005]  Thought the microphone was off.
[02:36:30.025 --> 02:36:35.667]  This isn't the first time this has happened to George W. But we'll play this minute clip now and then go right back to the phones.
[02:36:35.707 --> 02:36:36.507]  John, go ahead and roll that.
[02:36:37.007 --> 02:36:42.749]  President Bush is flying back from the G8 Summit in Russia right now, where the main topic was the Middle East violence.
[02:36:42.909 --> 02:36:46.751]  And the President was caught speaking very frankly about the crisis.
[02:36:46.931 --> 02:36:49.112]  NBC's Kelly O'Donnell is traveling with the President.
[02:36:49.512 --> 02:36:50.232]  Kelly, good morning.
[02:36:52.338 --> 02:36:53.178]  Good morning, Natalie.
[02:36:53.539 --> 02:37:03.162]  Some extraordinarily candid comments from President Bush today on the Middle East conflict, when he didn't think anyone else was listening, except British Prime Minister Tony Blair.
[02:37:03.763 --> 02:37:21.770]  At the final working lunch today of the G8 Summit, with cameras visible and microphones on from official Russian TV, not US media, President Bush, apparently not knowing he could be heard, shared with Tony Blair his unvarnished opinion.
[02:37:22.190 --> 02:37:26.392]  The irony is that what they need to do is get serious, get head-butted, and stop doing their sh** and hold on.
[02:37:26.432 --> 02:37:27.192]  What about Kofi Annan?
[02:37:27.252 --> 02:37:28.952]  His attitude is basically cease-fire and everything else.
[02:37:42.965 --> 02:37:43.806]  If we have the deployment,
[02:37:59.338 --> 02:38:11.788]  ...of an international force into that area that can stop the bombardment coming over into Israel and therefore gives Israel the reason to stop its attacks on Hezbollah.
[02:38:12.228 --> 02:38:17.312]  It appears it was Blair who noticed the microphone was on and he reached over to turn it off.
[02:38:17.812 --> 02:38:27.260]  When asked about the tape, White House officials say the President's comments may have been more blunt in private but are the same as his views expressed in...
[02:38:27.955 --> 02:38:29.716]  Well, not exactly the same.
[02:38:29.736 --> 02:38:33.998]  I don't know what this is going to do for diplomacy around the world, but I think it's very revealing.
[02:38:34.398 --> 02:38:41.501]  In fact, at one point, when George W. Bush swears, he says that we just need to tell Hezbollah to stop that blank.
[02:38:42.622 --> 02:38:43.722]  Who is he talking to?
[02:38:43.742 --> 02:38:45.323]  Has anybody figured that out?
[02:38:46.548 --> 02:38:50.449]  Is he saying that there's a way you can push a button and stop the violence from Hezbollah?
[02:38:50.489 --> 02:38:52.630]  I mean, we should give them a call and tell them to knock it off?
[02:38:53.110 --> 02:38:54.710]  That that's a possibility here?
[02:38:55.290 --> 02:38:59.632]  Also, you see the extent of his attitude or his knowledge of foreign policy.
[02:38:59.972 --> 02:39:01.492]  Russia's big, and so is China.
[02:39:02.192 --> 02:39:05.753]  He's figured that much out anyway, and obviously he still thinks he's in control.
[02:39:06.413 --> 02:39:07.794]  Let's go to George in Pennsylvania.
[02:39:07.814 --> 02:39:09.414]  George, any thoughts on that?
[02:39:11.255 --> 02:39:15.576]  It's not exactly why I called, but I kind of thought that thing was staged when I saw it the first time.
[02:39:16.724 --> 02:39:16.984]  Okay.
[02:39:17.405 --> 02:39:18.426]  I don't know if I agree with that.
[02:39:18.666 --> 02:39:24.531]  He's throwing the cuss word and he's got the roll in his mouth and he's, you know, trying to make it look more realistic.
[02:39:24.771 --> 02:39:28.835]  Yeah, did you see what an elitist he really is and how he could care less?
[02:39:28.855 --> 02:39:35.761]  He's chewing on a roll and the body language of how he's looking at Tony Blair like he's just one of his minions or something.
[02:39:35.801 --> 02:39:37.222]  I mean, I thought that was very revealing.
[02:39:38.043 --> 02:39:38.903]  Yeah, that part, yeah.
[02:39:40.049 --> 02:39:46.892]  That didn't add to the staging factor that struck me, but just what he was saying, you know?
[02:39:47.473 --> 02:39:50.774]  Like, we have to put pressure on Syria, you know, and that goes right along with his line.
[02:39:51.295 --> 02:39:52.295]  Yeah.
[02:39:52.315 --> 02:39:58.138]  The other reason I called was, I was wondering, you probably didn't hear the first two hours of George Norrie's show last night, but... I probably did.
[02:39:58.698 --> 02:39:59.018]  Okay.
[02:39:59.218 --> 02:40:02.380]  To me, man, he sounded like he got his talking points last night from Richard Perle.
[02:40:03.100 --> 02:40:06.642]  Yeah, I don't know what to say about that.
[02:40:06.682 --> 02:40:08.403]  I mean, I think, again,
[02:40:10.355 --> 02:40:11.876]  It's a reaction to fear.
[02:40:11.936 --> 02:40:22.905]  There's fear involved in Mr. Nori on the aspect that he really believes that we should be scared of Iran, and he just sounds very neocon-esque when he goes into those rants.
[02:40:23.405 --> 02:40:27.588]  Yeah, and his guest was a real Zionist.
[02:40:27.608 --> 02:40:34.834]  I was actually laughing when this guy said that the Israelis are such humanitarians that if Iran nuked them for the sake of humanity,
[02:40:35.410 --> 02:40:37.191]  They probably wouldn't strike back with nukes.
[02:40:37.471 --> 02:40:56.258]  Well, we're getting through to George Norrie and, you know, look, we can criticize him all we want for the things he says that we don't agree with, but I prefer to give him a pat on the back for the time that he allows us, having Alex Jones on the air, which I know is very popular for him, getting a chance to put out the information that we know about.
[02:40:56.338 --> 02:40:59.699]  So, look, I mean, I guess he's covering both sides of the issue.
[02:40:59.739 --> 02:41:00.060]  How's that?
[02:41:00.140 --> 02:41:01.200]  Is he objective or what?
[02:41:01.789 --> 02:41:11.092]  Well, it's a great thing that he let Alex come on, but it seems like the longer it's been since Alex has been back, it seems like he drifts back to this neo-con life.
[02:41:11.112 --> 02:41:12.092]  Hey, that's like all of us.
[02:41:12.392 --> 02:41:21.194]  George, I've got to tell you, man, I found myself in New York City at that coronation, maybe 50 feet away from George W. Bush, going, hmm, maybe Bush is right.
[02:41:21.974 --> 02:41:23.975]  Yeah, that can happen.
[02:41:23.995 --> 02:41:31.037]  You put yourself in that environment, and you'll be surprised at how fast the mind control and the conditioning sets back in.
[02:41:31.597 --> 02:41:32.118]  This is true.
[02:41:32.178 --> 02:41:36.221]  People I talk to, you know, I work on them for a couple of days and they're right with me.
[02:41:36.261 --> 02:41:38.123]  And then if I don't see them for a week, they're right back.
[02:41:38.463 --> 02:41:40.585]  Yeah, you got to really keep up with it all.
[02:41:40.625 --> 02:41:43.387]  Georgia and Pennsylvania, we're going to see you at Ground Zero on 9-11?
[02:41:44.928 --> 02:41:45.609]  I'll try to get up there.
[02:41:45.669 --> 02:41:46.750]  I'd love to meet you up there.
[02:41:46.790 --> 02:41:48.291]  Hopefully we'll be able to do that, okay?
[02:41:48.411 --> 02:41:48.831]  Okay, fantastic.
[02:41:48.871 --> 02:41:50.112]  I will be there waiting for you.
[02:41:50.373 --> 02:41:52.374]  Let's go to Les in West Virginia.
[02:41:52.474 --> 02:41:53.375]  Les, thank you for holding.
[02:41:53.395 --> 02:41:54.396]  You're on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:41:54.957 --> 02:41:55.557]  Hello, brother.
[02:41:55.597 --> 02:41:56.178]  How you doing?
[02:41:56.318 --> 02:41:56.838]  I'm very good.
[02:41:56.858 --> 02:41:57.198]  Yourself?
[02:41:57.419 --> 02:41:58.079]  Fine, thank you.
[02:41:58.539 --> 02:42:00.281]  Thank you for receiving my call.
[02:42:01.651 --> 02:42:06.914]  You kind of hit the nail on the head yesterday when you said Israel, or modern Israel.
[02:42:07.395 --> 02:42:08.616]  Now, I'm a teacher.
[02:42:08.736 --> 02:42:17.722]  I've taught several classes in a couple of churches, and I'm not bragging, but we need to go to the Bible to see what's really going on.
[02:42:17.802 --> 02:42:22.366]  We are facing the spirit of Antichrist.
[02:42:22.406 --> 02:42:24.067]  John said that in 1 John 5.
[02:42:24.527 --> 02:42:28.150]  Now, I'm not going to preach, but I tell you, the Bible is very clear.
[02:42:28.820 --> 02:42:31.987]  The Bible teaches us that there are two Israels.
[02:42:32.789 --> 02:42:35.756]  Paul said in Romans 9, all of Israel are not Israel.
[02:42:36.092 --> 02:42:41.013]  They're just full of the flesh, and these are not the children of God, but the heirs according to promise.
[02:42:41.273 --> 02:42:42.993]  That's what I was kind of getting at yesterday.
[02:42:43.353 --> 02:42:57.196]  You know, here's what I'm worried about, Les, and I think that this is certainly the spiritual end of this has got to be in the equation, but here's what I'm worried about is that the, I'll call them the neocons, but let's call them the globalists, let's call them the illuminati, call them the new world order, call them whatever you want.
[02:42:57.216 --> 02:43:04.077]  I'm afraid that they're going to use what's in the Bible and what's in various religious texts about the end times
[02:43:04.917 --> 02:43:06.478]  In order to create that.
[02:43:06.518 --> 02:43:09.480]  In other words, it's not going to happen naturally.
[02:43:09.541 --> 02:43:11.722]  It's not going to happen when it's supposed to happen.
[02:43:11.742 --> 02:43:16.826]  They're going to make sure it happens, and they're going to convince everybody that this is Armageddon.
[02:43:16.906 --> 02:43:22.750]  And I think that in some ways, somebody writing out the memos are talking about this very issue.
[02:43:22.790 --> 02:43:23.630]  Exactly like that.
[02:43:23.890 --> 02:43:26.152]  Real or promulgated, they'll make it happen.
[02:43:26.472 --> 02:43:27.693]  I agree with you, Brother Jack.
[02:43:27.733 --> 02:43:32.036]  Now listen, the spirit of Antichrist has already attacked the pulpits.
[02:43:32.492 --> 02:43:40.237]  The paupers have been hampered and hamstrung by this IRS... Have you seen this story about the IRS?
[02:43:40.658 --> 02:43:40.878]  Sir?
[02:43:41.098 --> 02:43:44.400]  Have you seen this story about the IRS warning churches to avoid campaigning?
[02:43:44.440 --> 02:43:57.269]  I just heard that and it doesn't surprise me because Satan got his nose under the tent by getting churches on their payroll, so to speak, because I left the church last year.
[02:43:57.816 --> 02:43:58.376]  That's right.
[02:44:19.548 --> 02:44:32.999]  It's because the Democratic Party has put together a strategy to get the Martin Luther King types, the more liberal religious types, out on the campaign trail to show that they have morals and they're Christians too.
[02:44:33.660 --> 02:44:39.305]  So magically, about two weeks later, the Internal Revenue Service has been warning churches and non-profit organizations
[02:44:39.505 --> 02:44:40.265]  Listen, I'm gonna be quick.
[02:44:40.285 --> 02:44:43.566]  The Bible says that there's Israel of the flesh, there's an Israel of the spirit, and who are they?
[02:45:01.553 --> 02:45:04.074]  They're all born-again Christians, and a little bit of study.
[02:45:04.394 --> 02:45:05.855]  I mean, that's Jew and Gentile alike.
[02:45:05.915 --> 02:45:10.437]  Paul taught that there's no difference between a Jew and Gentile when we accept Jesus Christ as our Savior.
[02:45:10.877 --> 02:45:11.317]  Period.
[02:45:11.337 --> 02:45:17.260]  Now, those that profess to be Christians have to look at the Bible, not to be a pacifist or anything.
[02:45:17.300 --> 02:45:18.080]  No, I'm a worker.
[02:45:18.140 --> 02:45:19.701]  I'm spreading these things around.
[02:45:19.921 --> 02:45:23.042]  I'm taking these VCRs and these DVDs around.
[02:45:23.363 --> 02:45:25.423]  I'm telling everybody that, well, listen.
[02:45:25.944 --> 02:45:28.105]  Now, we have to realize that we're fighting
[02:45:29.748 --> 02:45:31.028]  Spiritual warfare!
[02:45:31.369 --> 02:45:33.569]  These people are demon possessed!
[02:45:33.829 --> 02:45:34.509]  I believe that!
[02:45:34.710 --> 02:45:39.691]  Well, I believe... Thank you, Les, and I think that probably encouraged a lot of people to hear you make those comments.
[02:45:39.731 --> 02:45:49.654]  I believe that we need to put pressure on our pastors, on our church leaders, in order to start taking up and disseminating and at least discussing, having these discussions from the pulpit.
[02:45:49.914 --> 02:45:53.695]  I believe it is part of spiritual warfare, personally, for myself.
[02:45:53.955 --> 02:45:56.896]  I may not subscribe to the same doctrine as some of you folks, but
[02:45:57.436 --> 02:46:00.277]  I do believe that and I think it will put some pressure on these churches.
[02:46:00.297 --> 02:46:05.319]  Get them to sign off the 501c3 or get them to stand up to the IRS and to the federal government.
[02:46:05.779 --> 02:46:07.400]  I know we're going to see more changes.
[02:46:07.700 --> 02:46:10.161]  Les, I appreciate the call and you keep the faith.
[02:46:10.521 --> 02:46:12.482]  Ruth is calling in from North Carolina.
[02:46:12.522 --> 02:46:13.522]  Ruth, thank you for calling.
[02:46:13.542 --> 02:46:14.643]  You're on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:46:14.963 --> 02:46:15.763]  Thank you, Jack.
[02:46:17.664 --> 02:46:20.585]  I'm on the same subject that you just got through with.
[02:46:21.065 --> 02:46:25.207]  I wish everyone, when they think about Israel,
[02:46:25.856 --> 02:46:31.718]  They would turn to Revelations and read Chapter 2, verse 9.
[02:46:32.358 --> 02:46:34.959]  Chapter 3, verse 9.
[02:46:35.419 --> 02:46:38.099]  To me, that is Israel.
[02:46:38.119 --> 02:46:39.880]  Okay.
[02:46:40.760 --> 02:46:41.400]  Anything else, Ruth?
[02:46:41.700 --> 02:46:42.321]  That's it.
[02:46:42.361 --> 02:46:43.601]  Thank you for putting that on the record.
[02:46:43.681 --> 02:46:45.061]  Mike is calling from Texas.
[02:46:45.121 --> 02:46:46.002]  Mike, thank you for calling.
[02:46:46.022 --> 02:46:47.082]  You're on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:46:47.822 --> 02:46:52.984]  Hey, I just want to say, first of all, I just hope all the liberals out there simply worship all things.
[02:46:53.124 --> 02:46:54.304]  Clinton got a big dose of her.
[02:46:55.416 --> 02:46:56.278]  I don't know.
[02:47:03.254 --> 02:47:05.636]  Oh, if we had a woman for president, it wouldn't be any worse.
[02:47:06.456 --> 02:47:07.777]  I wonder what the Democrats make of it.
[02:47:07.797 --> 02:47:21.087]  I mean, yesterday, again, two of the most public people in the world at a chummy breakfast, that being media mogul Rupert Murdoch and Senator Hillary Clinton, trying to keep their political get-together as secret as possible.
[02:47:21.147 --> 02:47:22.288]  Working together!
[02:47:22.308 --> 02:47:29.633]  I mean, this is just like the Republicans managing and financing Al Sharpton's campaign in the last go-around.
[02:47:30.205 --> 02:47:35.169]  I know it's like when you find Andy Kaufman and the guy you're supposed to be wrestling against having a meeting backstage.
[02:47:35.470 --> 02:47:43.036]  Another thing I wanted to say was regarding your call to people in the peace movement to do more than just send emails to friends and to get out on the streets.
[02:47:43.617 --> 02:47:45.098]  I know you say you'd like to encourage websites.
[02:47:45.158 --> 02:47:52.585]  I don't have one, but I'm saying I would like to take this opportunity to urge someone out there who has the wherewithal to make a website, to have a website bulletin board.
[02:47:53.226 --> 02:47:59.168]  It could be called like March, this doesn't exist, but I'm saying like MarchDate.com or something that would have announcements about upcoming marches.
[02:47:59.228 --> 02:48:00.668]  All the marches in one place.
[02:48:01.209 --> 02:48:04.009]  You could just go to it and go, where's this week's march going to be?
[02:48:04.049 --> 02:48:08.731]  It would be so much, if somebody could just make a website like that, believe me, I have the time to go march, I don't have the...
[02:48:09.215 --> 02:48:09.935]  I have a computer.
[02:48:10.195 --> 02:48:11.456]  It's not a bad idea though.
[02:48:11.476 --> 02:48:12.376]  I will tell you this.
[02:48:12.456 --> 02:48:16.597]  I mean, I put all the marches and all the events up on my website.
[02:48:16.617 --> 02:48:18.038]  I know Alex does this as well.
[02:48:18.118 --> 02:48:18.338]  I do?
[02:48:18.998 --> 02:48:19.378]  Oh yeah.
[02:48:19.438 --> 02:48:21.699]  I mean, you've got to file through some of the news.
[02:48:21.739 --> 02:48:22.919]  They're not in one section.
[02:48:22.939 --> 02:48:24.279]  Maybe we can do that for you.
[02:48:24.339 --> 02:48:25.320]  Put them in one section.
[02:48:25.600 --> 02:48:27.540]  I've got to tell you, I think we've got enough websites.
[02:48:27.560 --> 02:48:32.061]  I think what we need to do is get people out there to promote the website and get out there and take action.
[02:48:32.082 --> 02:48:35.482]  I mean, if we have two million websites, is it one million not enough?
[02:48:35.803 --> 02:48:37.243]  I don't know the answer to that question.
[02:48:37.463 --> 02:48:38.566]  But that's a good suggestion, Mike.
[02:48:38.606 --> 02:48:39.208]  I appreciate it.
[02:48:39.348 --> 02:48:40.070]  We'll come right back.
[02:48:40.151 --> 02:48:41.655]  Finish up the program right after this, folks.
[02:48:41.675 --> 02:48:42.036]  Stay tuned.
[02:48:44.486 --> 02:48:45.947]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:48:46.147 --> 02:48:49.230]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[02:48:49.370 --> 02:48:53.273]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[02:48:53.313 --> 02:48:57.577]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[02:48:57.897 --> 02:49:01.660]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[02:49:01.820 --> 02:49:03.662]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[02:49:03.802 --> 02:49:07.145]  Riot police attacked people on the street indiscriminately.
[02:49:07.185 --> 02:49:08.266]  The medical bills!
[02:49:09.086 --> 02:49:11.888]  Are going to be enormous for me.
[02:49:12.028 --> 02:49:15.070]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[02:49:15.250 --> 02:49:18.112]  They are being let into the Sandpoint Brig.
[02:49:18.593 --> 02:49:24.717]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[02:49:25.237 --> 02:49:29.039]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.

[02:50:45.413 --> 02:50:45.854]  Thank you.
[02:51:00.675 --> 02:51:01.356]  We're good to go!
[02:51:30.217 --> 02:51:33.319]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[02:51:33.480 --> 02:51:39.464]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[02:51:46.990 --> 02:51:53.034]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:51:53.635 --> 02:51:56.617]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:51:59.608 --> 02:52:05.511]  Well, I want to thank everybody for being so kind to me and welcoming me these last three days, filling in for Alex Jones.
[02:52:05.551 --> 02:52:08.633]  It's always an honor to sit in this chair at InfoWars Studio.
[02:52:08.653 --> 02:52:16.698]  I want to thank all the producers and all of the people working here for this organization who have been really, really helpful for me for the last couple of days.
[02:52:16.758 --> 02:52:20.240]  Not easy preparing for and doing five hours of programming a day.
[02:52:21.040 --> 02:52:26.307]  I'm about up for two a day, so this really stretches my capabilities.
[02:52:26.367 --> 02:52:40.184]  If you believe I did a good job and you want to support me and show Alex Jones that we did a good job for him while he was away and we can trust him to take a little time off from now and again, call and order the videos, the t-shirts, the books.
[02:52:40.664 --> 02:52:44.446]  Make your orders now at 888-253-3139.
[02:52:44.686 --> 02:52:47.307]  Tell the operators it's because Jack Blood told you to do it.
[02:52:47.547 --> 02:52:48.448]  Okay?
[02:52:48.468 --> 02:52:50.128]  That's kind of a vote of confidence.
[02:52:50.529 --> 02:52:51.249]  Infowars.com, 888-253-3139.
[02:52:51.269 --> 02:52:52.430]  I will be back here in just about...
[02:52:55.911 --> 02:52:59.332]  Six minutes after we end this program, Andre Eglishan will be joining us.
[02:52:59.372 --> 02:53:00.453]  He's got a new book out.
[02:53:00.473 --> 02:53:01.593]  This guy's just amazing.
[02:53:01.893 --> 02:53:07.756]  Where the Right Went Wrong on National Security and the Left Too, by Andre Michael Eglishan.
[02:53:08.056 --> 02:53:12.177]  Also, his book Thieves in the Temple, America Under the Federal Reserve System, is a must-have.
[02:53:12.197 --> 02:53:18.100]  We'll be talking about these new developments in the Federal Reserve, with Andre Eglishan joining us in Deadline Live, coming up right after this program.
[02:53:18.120 --> 02:53:19.540]  We're going to go rapid fire here.
[02:53:19.600 --> 02:53:20.560]  Three tail gunners.
[02:53:20.881 --> 02:53:23.422]  All of them will share space, about 30 seconds each or so.
[02:53:23.442 --> 02:53:24.402]  Put something on the record.
[02:53:24.702 --> 02:53:26.043]  Tom in Georgia, you're up.
[02:53:27.145 --> 02:53:31.749]  Yeah, I was listening to you guys last night with Webster Tarpley on the shortwave.
[02:53:32.270 --> 02:53:36.434]  You were talking about how they're trying to stage this thing to get into an event with Iran.
[02:53:36.454 --> 02:53:36.994]  Yeah.
[02:53:37.054 --> 02:53:44.522]  Well, there was a Fox reporter yesterday after one of these missiles came in, just happened to have a handful of ball bearings.
[02:53:45.034 --> 02:53:51.116]  And said, all these missiles, obviously with these ball bearings, came from Syria and Iran gave them to them.
[02:53:51.316 --> 02:53:54.978]  That's a conspiracy theory, but it's nice how they get to use props, okay?
[02:53:55.238 --> 02:53:56.418]  Thank you, Tom, for the call.
[02:53:56.458 --> 02:53:57.778]  Let's go to Betty in Florida.
[02:53:57.818 --> 02:54:00.219]  Betty, got about 30 seconds for you to put something on the record.
[02:54:00.499 --> 02:54:04.981]  Yeah, Jack, I just want people to get out there and protest the REAL ID Act.
[02:54:05.621 --> 02:54:10.003]  This is something that is going to become in effect in 2008.
[02:54:10.063 --> 02:54:12.504]  A lot of people are not aware of it.
[02:54:12.684 --> 02:54:13.444]  We can't just
[02:54:14.145 --> 02:54:17.008]  Um, talk about it or sit back and say it's terrible.
[02:54:17.268 --> 02:54:19.791]  You need to get before your city councils if you can.
[02:54:19.811 --> 02:54:20.912]  I've been speaking out.
[02:54:21.522 --> 02:54:24.863]  I belong to Citizens Guarding Freedom, which I founded a few months ago.
[02:54:24.883 --> 02:54:29.424]  I find it no problem to get on the agendas of every city in my county, and that's what I've been doing.
[02:54:29.444 --> 02:54:32.625]  Betty, will you please write me at jackblood at hotmail.com.
[02:54:32.645 --> 02:54:33.345]  Could you do that?
[02:54:33.565 --> 02:54:34.705]  And give me your information.
[02:54:34.746 --> 02:54:37.466]  I'll probably have you up as a guest on my program, because I agree with you.
[02:54:37.486 --> 02:54:43.348]  These internal biometric passports are the beginning of the end, and certainly a line in the sand that we all have to draw.
[02:54:43.368 --> 02:54:44.888]  I appreciate you putting that on the record.
[02:54:44.908 --> 02:54:46.709]  Contact me, Betty, and I'll have you up on my show.
[02:54:46.729 --> 02:54:47.829]  We'll talk about it a little bit more.
[02:54:48.229 --> 02:54:50.451]  Ron in Texas, final caller for today.
[02:54:50.651 --> 02:54:51.291]  Thank you for calling.
[02:54:51.331 --> 02:54:52.332]  Put something on the record, Ron.
[02:54:52.832 --> 02:54:55.754]  Well, I appreciate you and Alex both and everything you're trying to do.
[02:54:56.135 --> 02:54:57.396]  Got three quick comments.
[02:54:57.516 --> 02:55:06.682]  First of all, I think it's deplorable that our country has left all of our Americans over there with such a slow effort in trying to get them removed from Lebanon.
[02:55:07.463 --> 02:55:13.287]  Second, I talked to a local preacher here and he told me he had to be discreet about who he told about it.
[02:55:14.187 --> 02:55:17.750]  Third comment is that about ten days ago I called my congressman
[02:55:18.476 --> 02:55:22.880]  And left a message with him that it involved treason, and I still haven't heard from him.
[02:55:24.081 --> 02:55:24.602]  Keep at him!
[02:55:25.363 --> 02:55:26.524]  I will, sir.
[02:55:26.764 --> 02:55:28.305]  Don't take no for an answer.
[02:55:28.386 --> 02:55:29.386]  Be persistent.
[02:55:29.607 --> 02:55:31.809]  Pretend like you're getting a job with the New World Order.
[02:55:32.149 --> 02:55:34.611]  That's how they react to things.
[02:55:34.631 --> 02:55:35.712]  You have to be persistent.
[02:55:35.953 --> 02:55:38.996]  You have to be a little patient, and you have to be relentless.
[02:55:39.276 --> 02:55:41.138]  Or vigilant, as President Bush liked to say.
[02:55:42.019 --> 02:55:43.160]  Thank you for the call, Ron.
[02:55:43.321 --> 02:55:45.123]  Thanks for everybody for listening.
[02:55:45.364 --> 02:55:45.945]  Go out there.
[02:55:46.025 --> 02:55:47.487]  Tell people about the Alex Jones Show.
[02:55:47.547 --> 02:55:49.710]  Tell people about InfoWars.com.
[02:55:49.951 --> 02:55:51.893]  Tell people about PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:55:52.134 --> 02:55:53.255]  We are on the march.
[02:55:53.316 --> 02:55:54.417]  The enemy is on the run.
[02:55:54.437 --> 02:55:56.440]  Now get out there and fight the New World Order.
[02:55:56.460 --> 02:55:57.522]  I'll see you in about six minutes.
[02:56:24.209 --> 02:56:28.794]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-376-45.
