[00:00:05.535 --> 00:00:06.175]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.856 --> 00:00:07.916]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.616 --> 00:00:09.796]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.376 --> 00:00:11.216]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.937 --> 00:00:12.837]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.857 --> 00:00:17.318]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.698 --> 00:00:21.819]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:31.541]  I have an article here in front of me on this live Thursday edition, the 27th day.
[00:00:34.748 --> 00:00:37.789]  of April 2006 from the Tennessean.
[00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:42.431]  I have another one from the Vaccine Awareness Network and another from the Associated Press.
[00:00:42.952 --> 00:00:47.814]  Mercury preservative will continue in some flu vaccines.
[00:00:48.074 --> 00:00:56.558]  Now, I remember three years ago when they claimed that they were taking these mercury, the thimerosal preservative, out of all the vaccines.
[00:00:56.598 --> 00:00:59.319]  I remember reading that and seeing it on television
[00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:17.283]  And hearing it on the radio and then going and reading Associated Press articles and others that said actually they're making available by regulatory law, you could call it, non-mercury based vaccines in small lots.
[00:01:18.443 --> 00:01:26.245]  But vaccines themselves in general are going from 50 times the safe level in a single shot
[00:01:27.283 --> 00:01:30.584]  To 250 times the safe level.
[00:01:30.924 --> 00:01:32.905]  That was in the Associated Press.
[00:01:34.765 --> 00:01:39.206]  And I've warned everyone about this, and I get calls and emails every week, oh Alex, they say they took it out.
[00:01:39.867 --> 00:01:43.308]  And then we talk to doctors, we talk to nurses, no they haven't.
[00:01:43.988 --> 00:01:52.010]  But here it is out of the mainstream newspaper, the Tennessean, mercury preservative will continue in some flu vaccines.
[00:01:53.732 --> 00:01:55.515]  So we'll be getting into that.
[00:01:56.276 --> 00:02:02.724]  We're scheduled to have John McManus, the head of the John Birch Society, joining us to talk about the open borders, globalism, the New World Order.
[00:02:02.764 --> 00:02:08.392]  He's scheduled to be speaking this weekend, I believe this evening, here in Austin, Texas.
[00:02:09.753 --> 00:02:12.858]  And he'll be joining us coming up later in this hour.
[00:02:12.878 --> 00:02:18.086]  And of course, Michael Rivero of WhatReallyHappened.com with his monthly report that he gives us.
[00:02:18.186 --> 00:02:20.931]  Always gracious to join us coming up in the second hour.
[00:02:20.971 --> 00:02:24.737]  We'll have open phones throughout the day as well.
[00:02:26.576 --> 00:02:28.137]  Speaking of vaccines, U.S.
[00:02:28.217 --> 00:02:30.859]  efforts might not slow pandemic of bird flu.
[00:02:30.919 --> 00:02:41.126]  Seattle Post-Intelligencer, science writer, Seth Borenstein, basically it's all over, even martial law won't save us, so we'll be getting into that.
[00:02:41.146 --> 00:02:47.251]  Some good news, Governor Lynch says he will sign bill opposing the National ID Card, known as the Real ID Act.
[00:02:47.851 --> 00:02:52.294]  Senate panel recommends abolishing the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
[00:02:52.334 --> 00:02:53.355]  Is that good or bad?
[00:02:53.755 --> 00:02:54.676]  What's really going on here?
[00:02:54.696 --> 00:02:56.157]  Will they replace it with something worse?
[00:02:57.222 --> 00:03:00.964]  And we'll continue with students to get no warning before searches.
[00:03:01.824 --> 00:03:11.169]  Mayor Bloomberg isn't just going to have random police sweeps on the streets shaking everyone down as they have now in Houston and Miami under federal funding with the quote Viper teams.
[00:03:11.649 --> 00:03:22.415]  Now the regular Metropolitan Police in New York will be running around searching the students with no warning, training them that this is a prison grid, prison planet society as well.
[00:03:23.135 --> 00:03:29.220]  Also, out of the Dakota Voice newspaper, White House snubs 9-11 families and victims of illegal alien crimes.
[00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:34.303]  That is just some of what is coming up as well.
[00:03:34.343 --> 00:03:37.706]  We'll get into Russian Member of Parliament predicts start of war.
[00:03:38.602 --> 00:03:45.470]  In Iran this year, but he's made predictions before that haven't come true, so we'll take that with a large grain of salt.
[00:03:45.791 --> 00:03:47.152]  Kurt Nemo, great editorial.
[00:03:47.453 --> 00:03:51.297]  Tony Snowjob, the new whitewasher, to be White House Press Secretary.
[00:03:51.317 --> 00:03:52.399]  Some comments on him.
[00:03:52.939 --> 00:03:56.624]  Anger as Scotland faces Big Brother ID cards, and much more.
[00:03:58.439 --> 00:04:22.238]  The websites are www.infowars.com, www.prisonplanet.com, www.prisonplanet.tv, www.jonesreport.com, www.infowars.net, www.martiallaw911.info, and then of course we have our Yahoo group and we then have our MySpace group that we've been testing and looking at and now expanding.
[00:04:23.524 --> 00:04:28.046]  Also, coming up later today, I will give you a review of the new film, A Scanner Darkly.
[00:04:28.426 --> 00:04:44.034]  I had seen parts of it during production, consulting on it, and also appearing in the film, but then I had a chance to see the almost finished project a few months ago when it showed here at the Film Festival in Austin, South by Southwest, and now it is completed
[00:04:44.754 --> 00:04:47.358]  With Graham Reynolds, great music, radio head, you name it.
[00:04:47.438 --> 00:04:49.221]  And it is a groundbreaking film.
[00:04:49.641 --> 00:04:54.288]  So I'll give you a review of that and some inside details coming up later as well.
[00:04:54.328 --> 00:04:59.356]  And we'll be posting a lot of information over the weekend about A Scanner Darkly on InfoWars.com
[00:05:02.378 --> 00:05:05.220]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[00:05:05.481 --> 00:05:07.062]  Hello, my friends, Alex Jones here.
[00:05:07.402 --> 00:05:12.086]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[00:05:12.427 --> 00:05:16.830]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy.
[00:05:17.271 --> 00:05:21.474]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has arisen.
[00:05:21.674 --> 00:05:24.517]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[00:05:24.617 --> 00:05:27.119]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks,
[00:05:27.299 --> 00:05:33.865]  With the roots and history of its orchestrators, Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[00:05:34.105 --> 00:05:41.331]  Plunge the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[00:05:41.591 --> 00:05:43.993]  Discover the documentary for yourself before it's too late.
[00:05:44.173 --> 00:05:45.895]  Call toll-free to get a copy of Martial Law.
[00:05:46.775 --> 00:05:52.038]  1-888-253-3139 or visit InfoWars.com and the secure shopping cart.
[00:05:52.139 --> 00:05:59.022]  That's InfoWars.com or 888-253-3139 or watch the film right now online at PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:08.882]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones introducing you to the incredible Berkey Solar Charger, your source for free solar electricity.
[00:06:09.122 --> 00:06:16.223]  This portable system is the size of a book when folded and small enough to fit into a briefcase, handbag, or glove compartment.
[00:06:16.363 --> 00:06:27.905]  The Berkey Solar Charger has been designed to power the Berkey lights, LED lamps, as well as other applications such as mobile phones, radios, digital cameras, and PDAs when electricity is unavailable.
[00:06:28.266 --> 00:06:30.486]  Its multi-voltage capabilities, multiple
[00:06:30.486 --> 00:06:30.746]  I think so.
[00:06:46.355 --> 00:06:51.879]  Get the Incredible Berkey Solar Charger for only $75 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:06:51.999 --> 00:06:53.600]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:54.400]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[00:06:54.421 --> 00:06:58.783]  If you think your engine is safe by having the oil changed every 3,000 miles, think again.
[00:07:05.888 --> 00:07:09.472]  Every time you start your car, your engine creates friction between the moving parts.
[00:07:09.632 --> 00:07:17.760]  These moving parts wear against each other, and the result is small metal particles circulating through your oil, causing premature wear and damage to your engine.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:23.646]  Oil filters do a good job of trapping the large metal particles, but they will not trap the most harmful tiny particles.
[00:07:23.926 --> 00:07:29.188]  These tiny particles circulate constantly through your oil, and over time your engine begins to show signs of wear.
[00:07:29.449 --> 00:07:31.509]  This is why you need the Filter Mag.
[00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:43.935]  The Filter Mag is a powerful magnet that holds itself to the outside of your oil filter, trapping the tiny metal particles to the inside wall of the filter, extending the life of your oil and ultimately extending the life of your engine.
[00:07:44.175 --> 00:07:48.597]  The reusable FilterMag is maintenance-free, installs in two seconds, and lasts forever.
[00:07:48.817 --> 00:07:49.758]  So what are you waiting for?
[00:07:49.938 --> 00:07:51.578]  Go to FilterMag.com.
[00:07:51.699 --> 00:07:53.479]  That's FilterMag.com.
[00:07:53.739 --> 00:07:54.640]  Or call 800-345-8376.
[00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:57.181]  That's 800-345-8376.
[00:07:57.281 --> 00:08:08.326]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:08.947 --> 00:08:11.908]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:15.993 --> 00:08:24.200]  Coming up in a few minutes, we've got the president of the John Birch Society, John F. McManus, joining us for the Balance of the Hour.
[00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:35.468]  He'll be speaking tomorrow night at the Holiday Inn Northwest, 183 in Moorpark at 730 on the 28th, a $10 admission, doing a speaking tour around the country.
[00:08:35.508 --> 00:08:35.929]  That's good.
[00:08:37.290 --> 00:08:44.935]  And then of course we have the monthly report from Michael Rivero from WhatReallyHappened.com joining us coming up in the second hour.
[00:08:45.055 --> 00:08:49.378]  Into the third hour we'll have open phones and cover all the national and international news.
[00:08:50.439 --> 00:08:56.263]  New developments on the bird flu front as the government says they may have to give us martial law to keep us safe.
[00:08:57.003 --> 00:08:59.305]  But the media says even that may not be enough.
[00:09:00.214 --> 00:09:04.161]  And then, meanwhile, mercury preservative will continue in some flu vaccines.
[00:09:04.181 --> 00:09:07.306]  Folks, they never took the mercury out of the thimerosal.
[00:09:08.394 --> 00:09:24.547]  In fact, again, the Associated Press and even the CDC admitted that most of the major vaccines, the MMR, multiple jab shots, the flu vaccines, that they in many cases quadrupled or more the level of mercury in them.
[00:09:24.607 --> 00:09:32.753]  So, you complain about the Marisol, you get angry, you get upset about it, and they tell you they've taken it out, and then they actually increase the level.
[00:09:32.853 --> 00:09:35.255]  Well, here it is out of the Tennessean today.
[00:09:36.431 --> 00:09:39.252]  Mercury preservative will continue in some flu vaccines.
[00:09:39.813 --> 00:09:48.697]  Legislation that would prevent Tennessee children from getting flu shots that contain a controversial mercury preservative was withdrawn because the bill's sponsor didn't think it would pass.
[00:09:48.737 --> 00:10:02.724]  The bill's sponsor, our representative Susan Lynn, a Republican, would not allow pregnant women or any child younger than 8 to receive flu vaccines that contain more than trace amounts of thimerosal, a vaccine preservative that is 49.6-ethylmercury.
[00:10:05.902 --> 00:10:12.804]  Some people believe that thimerosal causes autism, but the FDA has said it has found no causal link between thimerosal and autism.
[00:10:13.544 --> 00:10:25.348]  Three years ago, Congressman Dan Burton forced the release of a 2000 document from the CDC where the head, it's the minutes of the meeting, admitting that millions have been brain damaged and they've got to cover it up, but they're not going to let their grandchildren take it.
[00:10:25.748 --> 00:10:26.968]  Those are the type of quotes in it.
[00:10:28.263 --> 00:10:31.286]  I think I had the support of a lot of members, and I'm grateful for that.
[00:10:31.366 --> 00:10:35.890]  Lynn said, however, that the persistence of special interests who derailed the bill were just too strong.
[00:10:35.930 --> 00:10:44.637]  The bill was opposed by the Tennessee Department of Health, the Tennessee chapter of the American Academy of Pediatricians, and Vanderbilt University Medical Center, among others.
[00:10:44.717 --> 00:10:50.642]  So, remember, when you hear there's no mercury in the vaccines anymore, it is a lie.
[00:10:51.514 --> 00:11:06.688]  What they did three years ago is they passed federal regulations that vaccine makers have to produce small lots that cost many times more than the mercury-containing vaccines available in case medical providers want it.
[00:11:08.930 --> 00:11:09.851]  That's what happened.
[00:11:11.713 --> 00:11:12.694]  That's what developed.
[00:11:13.494 --> 00:11:15.136]  So it's more smoke and mirrors.
[00:11:15.936 --> 00:11:17.937]  This is what they do at every level.
[00:11:18.037 --> 00:11:23.220]  So, to answer all the questions, I constantly get emails and phone calls and people on the street going, Alex!
[00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:25.121]  You say there's mercury in there!
[00:11:25.161 --> 00:11:26.302]  You're a liar!
[00:11:26.822 --> 00:11:27.943]  They've taken it out!
[00:11:28.043 --> 00:11:29.224]  I heard it on the news!
[00:11:29.384 --> 00:11:30.664]  I saw it on television!
[00:11:32.085 --> 00:11:40.210]  We have a vaccine section on PrisonPlanet.com and we have multiple mainstream news articles admitting that they've actually increased it
[00:11:40.936 --> 00:11:48.961]  In one example in the Associated Press, from 50 times safe levels to 250 times safe levels.
[00:11:49.001 --> 00:11:52.764]  They have increased it massively in the vaccines.
[00:11:52.904 --> 00:11:53.864]  That is the fact.
[00:11:56.106 --> 00:11:59.048]  And I would sincerely hope that people wake up to this fact.
[00:11:59.868 --> 00:12:08.314]  All right, we are joined by John F. McManus, and he is traveling the country giving a powerful presentation, an overview of our world.
[00:12:08.794 --> 00:12:10.135]  Freedom, few have it, most
[00:12:11.357 --> 00:12:11.697]  Don't?
[00:12:11.878 --> 00:12:12.578]  Why is that?
[00:12:13.539 --> 00:12:34.359]  And Mr. McManus, of course, has been involved with the John Birch Society since 1964, and he has been on their board of directors, he of course now is their president, and he has been all over national television, C-SPAN, he's written books, made documentary films, and
[00:12:35.476 --> 00:12:47.285]  He is now traveling the country, giving this lecture, an overview of our world, and he'll be speaking tomorrow night, the Holiday Inn Northwest, 183 in Mopac, at 730, Friday the 28th, $10 admission.
[00:12:47.305 --> 00:12:52.249]  And we'll give you more details later of how you can get those tickets.
[00:12:52.689 --> 00:12:57.133]  I wish I could go, but I'm in the middle of finishing a new documentary film, so I won't be there.
[00:12:57.353 --> 00:12:59.915]  Who knows, I might try to slip out and go see it.
[00:13:00.796 --> 00:13:01.596]  I don't want to miss it.
[00:13:02.357 --> 00:13:04.899]  But Mr. McManus, it's great to have you with us.
[00:13:05.626 --> 00:13:06.288]  Fine, thank you.
[00:13:06.368 --> 00:13:07.189]  It's nice to be with you.
[00:13:07.751 --> 00:13:08.693]  How do you like Texas?
[00:13:10.757 --> 00:13:13.182]  I like the United States of America, any part of it.
[00:13:14.201 --> 00:13:14.921]  Well, I do, too.
[00:13:14.981 --> 00:13:37.994]  For those that don't know who you are, for those that have only heard the media spin about the JBS over the years, which I've never been a member of, but many of my friends are, and I do a lot of good work around the country with your publications, videos, and books, tell us about John F. McManus, tell us about your founder, tell us about your illustrious history, and then what your game plan is today for stopping the globalist takeover.
[00:13:38.624 --> 00:13:46.887]  Well, the John Birch Society was formed in 1958 by a man named Robert Welch, and he named it after World War II hero John Birch, who served in China.
[00:13:48.367 --> 00:13:59.171]  I got involved with the Society in 1962, when I was influenced by the mass media attack on the Society, and I have to admit, I agreed with what I was hearing.
[00:13:59.211 --> 00:14:02.552]  The John Birch Society is a bunch of screwballs, and dangerous, and so on.
[00:14:03.729 --> 00:14:12.396]  Eventually, a member of the Burt Society contacted me and asked me if I was basing my attitude on what the Society had said or what others had said of it.
[00:14:13.217 --> 00:14:20.082]  I thought that was a pretty good question, so I wrote back to the fellow and I always say, there began a torturous re-evaluation.
[00:14:20.883 --> 00:14:25.486]  So, I joined the Society in 1964 and they asked me to take a staff position in 1966.
[00:14:26.127 --> 00:14:29.029]  I've been with the Society ever since.
[00:14:29.958 --> 00:14:34.522]  I was named the president of the organization in 1991 and I'm very pleased to serve.
[00:14:36.024 --> 00:14:38.946]  The John Birch Society is trying to preserve the American system.
[00:14:39.206 --> 00:14:44.791]  We believe what the Founding Fathers gave us is unique in history and certainly worthy of preservation.
[00:14:45.672 --> 00:14:51.117]  But we also believe there's a conspiracy operating to destroy our country and bring us into the New World Order.
[00:14:51.938 --> 00:14:55.281]  The Novus Ordo Seclorum, if you want it in Latin.
[00:14:56.272 --> 00:14:58.172]  And we're anxious to stop that.
[00:14:58.833 --> 00:15:04.654]  Some of our major programs are long-time programs to get us out of the United Nations.
[00:15:06.254 --> 00:15:12.215]  We've stepped up our information and our concern about the illegal immigration problem.
[00:15:13.115 --> 00:15:17.496]  And we have a lot of other issues that we publicize.
[00:15:17.536 --> 00:15:20.457]  We have a bi-weekly magazine called the New American
[00:15:21.209 --> 00:15:28.434]  We have films and book publishing and video production and all kinds of things that you'd expect of an educational organization.
[00:15:29.174 --> 00:15:31.556]  So there's a little bit of a thumbnail sketch.
[00:15:32.056 --> 00:15:35.238]  You're going to be speaking tomorrow night at the Holiday Inn at 7.30 p.m.
[00:15:35.258 --> 00:15:35.318]  Yes.
[00:15:38.493 --> 00:15:44.815]  And that's going to be a $10 admission, and of course later, I need to get Bob Dacey on, one of the local coordinators, to give us more details.
[00:15:44.835 --> 00:15:53.138]  We'll probably do that after you leave us later, but we have links to how folks can get tickets beforehand or they're at the door up on InfoWars.com.
[00:15:54.158 --> 00:15:58.279]  Just out of the gates here, sir, I want to get your take on two things that have happened in the last few weeks.
[00:15:58.819 --> 00:16:00.740]  I interviewed Dr. Hu just
[00:16:02.228 --> 00:16:15.775]  Dr. Wong, excuse me, just a few days ago the Chinese American doctor, the transplantee doctor, who valiantly stood up to President Hu, the new Chinese dictator,
[00:16:16.667 --> 00:16:21.971]  And of course it's admitted that they advertise in publications that they can give anybody any organ they want in two weeks.
[00:16:22.411 --> 00:16:29.516]  They have humans like cattle in these prisons and they just literally blood type them and take them out and then murder them for their organs.
[00:16:30.036 --> 00:16:31.777]  They're barbarians, they really are.
[00:16:32.197 --> 00:16:39.862]  And now she's being charged under a section of the Patriot Act intimidating a foreign official.
[00:16:39.922 --> 00:16:43.104]  She's facing six months in federal prison
[00:16:44.846 --> 00:16:46.006]  Just your take on that.
[00:16:46.367 --> 00:16:49.249]  I mean, I believe we're becoming more and more like Communist China every day.
[00:16:49.629 --> 00:16:49.929]  Right.
[00:16:50.069 --> 00:16:52.711]  Well, the United States is supposed to be the land of free speech.
[00:16:52.791 --> 00:16:53.751]  That's guaranteed.
[00:16:54.392 --> 00:16:57.574]  It's one of the God-given rights that we have protected by the First Amendment.
[00:16:58.294 --> 00:17:04.599]  If this woman stood up and protested, I think she said that he was a murderer and that he wasn't welcome in this country.
[00:17:04.679 --> 00:17:05.279]  I agree with her.
[00:17:06.060 --> 00:17:11.143]  I think she's very courageous and I don't think that she should be prosecuted for what she did.
[00:17:12.150 --> 00:17:23.449]  It might not have been the most polite thing to do, but why should you be polite with somebody who is a mass murderer, as any leader of Communist China is, by definition almost?
[00:17:23.914 --> 00:17:24.494]  Well, you're right.
[00:17:24.515 --> 00:17:34.001]  I mean, we have video now of every month where they machine gun crowds of farmers as they take their property, and the farmers fight back with hoes and picks and clubs.
[00:17:34.842 --> 00:17:41.787]  And China seems to be accelerating their abuse of their population, and suddenly our media and our government are defending them.
[00:17:42.187 --> 00:17:50.694]  Yeah, and our media and our government are the ones that have made the John Birch Society blackened in the eyes of a lot of people.
[00:17:51.574 --> 00:17:55.859]  That they would take up the cause of the Communist Chinese is no surprise to me.
[00:17:56.499 --> 00:18:01.465]  But Communist China is still a Communist country.
[00:18:01.565 --> 00:18:02.806]  They have forced abortion.
[00:18:02.866 --> 00:18:04.308]  They have infanticide.
[00:18:04.368 --> 00:18:09.393]  They have this horrible one child per family rule.
[00:18:09.933 --> 00:18:11.315]  They suppress religion.
[00:18:11.335 --> 00:18:13.317]  They're suppressing the Falun Gong.
[00:18:14.884 --> 00:18:15.664]  group of people.
[00:18:16.124 --> 00:18:18.385]  But they're the apple of the UN's eye.
[00:18:18.405 --> 00:18:21.086]  They give them all the big awards for running a model society.
[00:18:21.466 --> 00:18:25.608]  Well, another reason to get us out of the United Nations, I guess, huh?
[00:18:25.728 --> 00:18:29.149]  What about David Rockefeller in 76 saying Mao's a wonderful person?
[00:18:29.549 --> 00:18:29.869]  Right.
[00:18:29.989 --> 00:18:38.612]  Well, David Rockefeller's the only American, oh no, I guess there was another Armand Hammer, who could fly a private plane into Moscow all during the years of the Soviet Union.
[00:18:39.372 --> 00:18:40.633]  He was buddy-buddy with them and
[00:18:42.168 --> 00:18:57.792]  You know, what it says is that he's a monopolist just like they are, and if we allow him to continue, spread his philosophy, his ideas, then we indeed will end up very much like the tyranny that exists in China today.
[00:18:58.456 --> 00:18:58.916]  Yes, sir.
[00:18:58.956 --> 00:19:02.238]  When we get back, I want to get into the illegal immigration, the open borders.
[00:19:02.318 --> 00:19:10.041]  It turns out even the Dallas Morning News admits that Bush and Cindy Fox's PR firm has staged all of these demonstrations.
[00:19:10.081 --> 00:19:17.384]  It's a fifth column brought into the country that the government can use to intimidate the majority of Americans, Hispanic, black, white, it doesn't matter.
[00:19:17.404 --> 00:19:20.906]  I want to get John F. McManus, president of the John Birch Society's view on that.
[00:19:21.426 --> 00:19:28.331]  And then I want you to just kind of give us an overview of the talk you've been giving that I'm told is riveting, an overview of our world.
[00:19:28.371 --> 00:19:32.894]  I'd like you to spend some time and give us an overview of our world in the segment after next.
[00:19:33.715 --> 00:19:44.423]  And then I'd like to talk about what you plan to do with the future of the John Birch Society as well as we speak to John F. McManus for the balance of this hour.
[00:19:45.263 --> 00:19:51.025]  And I've been trying to get Mr. Maness on for a few years, so it's great to have him with us today.
[00:19:51.385 --> 00:19:56.187]  We'll be right back after this quick break right here on the GCN Radio Network.

[00:23:56.330 --> 00:24:07.013]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:08.773 --> 00:24:12.834]  Waging war on corruption, crashing the lies and disinformation.
[00:24:12.854 --> 00:24:18.535]  We've got the president of the John Birch Society who's here in Austin, Texas today for a speech he's giving tomorrow night.
[00:24:19.352 --> 00:24:21.153]  We'll tell you more details before he leaves us.
[00:24:22.714 --> 00:24:39.525]  Sir, in your, I guess, 42 years of studying what's going on since 1964, can you give us a rundown on what's happening with the 20-plus million illegal aliens running around wrapped in Mexican flags, screaming La Reconquista?
[00:24:39.826 --> 00:24:42.107]  Can you give us your take on what's really going on behind that?
[00:24:43.208 --> 00:24:48.011]  Well, what's going on is simply an attempt to fracture our country and balkanize it.
[00:24:48.821 --> 00:24:53.025]  Set up pockets within it, essentially destroy the United States.
[00:24:53.605 --> 00:25:12.522]  You know, in my speech I like to talk about the Emperor Valens back in 370 AD, the Roman Emperor, and he opened up the gates of Rome, of the Empire, for the Visigoths and the Ostrogoths to come in, and he wanted them for cheap labor and for military recruits.
[00:25:13.567 --> 00:25:19.448]  Well, after a time, there were so many of them that they decided to get together and they started making war against the Roman legions.
[00:25:20.448 --> 00:25:23.409]  And finally, they ended up conquering Rome.
[00:25:23.909 --> 00:25:26.269]  And even killing Valens in one of the battles.
[00:25:26.689 --> 00:25:28.130]  That was in 410, wasn't it?
[00:25:29.150 --> 00:25:31.910]  Yeah, well, no, it was back in the 4th century.
[00:25:31.930 --> 00:25:42.312]  I mean, Rome finally really started falling in 410, then it emerged again and was gone by... Right, well, and it was largely a result of illegal... well, then he allowed it legally.
[00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:47.702]  But there were so many of them that came in and they didn't want to assimilate, they just wanted to take control.
[00:25:48.402 --> 00:26:02.907]  And when these people come here illegally and state that they don't want to assimilate, they demand that their children go to schools being taught in Spanish, they want Spanish language at the hospitals and at the social services centers and everything else.
[00:26:03.408 --> 00:26:04.408]  This is intolerable!
[00:26:04.929 --> 00:26:06.871]  You know, we are a nation of immigrants.
[00:26:07.011 --> 00:26:08.072]  There's no doubt about that.
[00:26:08.112 --> 00:26:11.735]  But we're all legal immigrants, or we're supposed to be.
[00:26:12.115 --> 00:26:13.616]  My people came across the sea.
[00:26:14.197 --> 00:26:15.518]  Yours probably did as well.
[00:26:16.318 --> 00:26:18.981]  And that's the way it is in America.
[00:26:19.521 --> 00:26:26.287]  Our nation is probably the leader of the world today in still allowing legal immigration into our country.
[00:26:26.767 --> 00:26:27.988]  But it's got to be controlled.
[00:26:28.028 --> 00:26:29.029]  If it's not controlled,
[00:26:29.631 --> 00:26:33.572]  Then pretty soon we're going to lose our country, and certainly we don't want that to happen.
[00:26:33.732 --> 00:26:40.154]  Well, clearly they want a Pan-American Union, the FTAA, and this is how they're going to get it.
[00:26:40.214 --> 00:26:41.855]  I mean, the elites want this.
[00:26:42.475 --> 00:26:50.658]  Cargill, the big meatpacking operation, one of the biggest in the country, is telling their people, their illegal alien employees, to take off Monday, to go out and protest.
[00:26:50.678 --> 00:26:51.398]  They support them!
[00:26:51.858 --> 00:26:54.859]  Yeah, well, these are the people like the improvalence.
[00:26:54.919 --> 00:26:58.540]  They want low-wage employees.
[00:27:00.201 --> 00:27:13.007]  The situation is such that the Constitution of the United States says, very bluntly, that the United States government has a responsibility to protect the states from invasion.
[00:27:13.947 --> 00:27:15.087]  And it's very clear.
[00:27:15.107 --> 00:27:16.948]  And it's not a military invasion.
[00:27:16.968 --> 00:27:18.089]  It doesn't say military.
[00:27:18.409 --> 00:27:19.429]  It says invasion.
[00:27:19.929 --> 00:27:25.432]  And if 11 to 20 million illegal immigrants in our country isn't an invasion, I don't know what it is.
[00:27:26.292 --> 00:27:28.893]  So the Constitution is being ignored in that regard,
[00:27:29.434 --> 00:27:35.517]  And it's also being ignored in many, many things that they're doing that they have no authorization for in the Constitution.
[00:27:35.557 --> 00:27:41.100]  For instance, foreign aid and aid to education and housing and welfare and medicine and so forth.
[00:27:41.140 --> 00:27:42.281]  Not in the Constitution.
[00:27:42.321 --> 00:27:42.881]  Not allowed.
[00:27:43.421 --> 00:27:44.462]  And it never should have been.
[00:27:44.922 --> 00:27:46.323]  You can get into the Federal Reserve.
[00:27:46.383 --> 00:27:47.203]  That's not allowed.
[00:27:47.243 --> 00:27:51.045]  You can get into the refusal to declare war.
[00:27:51.185 --> 00:27:53.146]  Congress alone can get us into war.
[00:27:53.266 --> 00:27:56.808]  We didn't have that in Korea, Vietnam, Desert Storm, and now this new
[00:27:57.749 --> 00:27:58.970]  War in Iraq.
[00:28:00.511 --> 00:28:02.372]  The Constitution is being violated.
[00:28:02.873 --> 00:28:08.217]  They're not doing what they're supposed to do, and they're doing plenty of things that they're not authorized to do.
[00:28:08.257 --> 00:28:10.818]  Mr. McMahon is president of the John Birch Society.
[00:28:10.939 --> 00:28:12.520]  Bush has said he's above the law.
[00:28:12.580 --> 00:28:21.886]  He has this doctrine on torture, on war-making, on signing bills that haven't even passed, a $2 billion bill a few months ago, on spying.
[00:28:21.906 --> 00:28:25.669]  I mean, he's openly declaring the power of a dictator.
[00:28:26.269 --> 00:28:26.910]  Well, that's true.
[00:28:27.558 --> 00:28:37.684]  And it goes back, you know, it goes back to a fellow named Edward Mandel House, the guru who was the director of the Wilson administration and the founder of the Council on Foreign Relations.
[00:28:38.285 --> 00:28:48.671]  In his own book he said he was working for socialism as dreamed of by Karl Marx, and he also said in that book that he wanted to see the president become an imperial power.
[00:28:49.614 --> 00:28:51.537]  One that doesn't have any restrictions on him.
[00:28:51.597 --> 00:28:53.760]  And what you've pointed out is exactly so.
[00:28:54.240 --> 00:28:57.825]  The President of the United States now feels that he's above the law.
[00:28:57.965 --> 00:28:59.407]  He can do whatever he pleases.
[00:29:00.048 --> 00:29:01.390]  And Congress is allowing it.
[00:29:01.450 --> 00:29:02.591]  The courts are allowing it.
[00:29:03.032 --> 00:29:04.694]  And the American people are allowing it.
[00:29:04.834 --> 00:29:07.758]  And if they don't stop it, we're going to end up in a tyranny.
[00:29:08.593 --> 00:29:15.816]  And he claims he's doing all of this to keep us safe from terrorism, but the borders are wide open, the government's clearly involved funding terrorist groups.
[00:29:16.336 --> 00:29:23.719]  Every step of the way, Bush, of course, is just a puppet of the globalists, but he's systematically butchering the country's sovereignty.
[00:29:24.120 --> 00:29:29.622]  Well, you know, imagine how many years after 9-1-1 and we still have wide open borders.
[00:29:30.062 --> 00:29:34.744]  I mean, this is just absolutely absurd, except that it plays into the hands
[00:29:35.262 --> 00:29:40.287]  Of a conspiracy that is trying to establish world government and to bring our, drag our nation into it.
[00:29:40.307 --> 00:29:41.848]  It's got to be stopped!
[00:29:42.549 --> 00:29:43.029]  I agree.
[00:29:43.230 --> 00:29:44.351]  A long segment coming up.
[00:29:44.431 --> 00:29:50.857]  I'll talk about a host of other issues and I want to hear about some of the solutions that you think are needed in this country, John McManus.
[00:29:51.638 --> 00:29:52.538]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.039 --> 00:29:54.620]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.561 --> 00:29:58.244]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.340 --> 00:30:07.324]  So you take care of your car, you change the oil, tune it up on a regular basis, and always make sure that it's running at its best.
[00:30:07.524 --> 00:30:09.885]  When it comes to your car, you demand performance.
[00:30:10.125 --> 00:30:13.427]  That's why you need SFR's Protecta Synthetic Oil Treatments.
[00:30:13.627 --> 00:30:18.390]  Protecta Engine Treatment, Protecta Transmission Treatment, and Protecta Complete Fuel System Treatment.

[00:31:01.445 --> 00:31:06.670]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[00:31:06.831 --> 00:31:14.919]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[00:31:15.179 --> 00:31:22.226]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[00:31:22.406 --> 00:31:23.667]  Radioactive poisoning.
[00:31:23.767 --> 00:31:29.650]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[00:31:29.850 --> 00:31:34.933]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[00:31:35.053 --> 00:31:43.919]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[00:31:44.199 --> 00:31:47.481]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5.

[00:33:20.501 --> 00:33:23.604]  John F. McManus is my guest for the rest of the hour.
[00:33:23.644 --> 00:33:25.705]  He'll be speaking tomorrow night at the Holiday Inn.
[00:33:25.745 --> 00:33:33.672]  We'll give you the address and time, and hope that you can join him for a talk that he's been giving that I hear is powerful, an overview of our world.
[00:33:35.125 --> 00:33:38.810]  John at McManus, what do you think the most important issues are right now today?
[00:33:38.890 --> 00:33:39.751]  I'll throw out a few.
[00:33:40.352 --> 00:33:47.882]  Everybody got upset about the UAE and Dubai Ports world trying to buy the British ports.
[00:33:47.922 --> 00:33:49.905]  That's right, 21 of them are already owned by the Brits.
[00:33:50.965 --> 00:33:55.708]  And then they didn't get upset, though, about the Communist Chinese taking over the Panama Canal, Long Beach.
[00:33:56.229 --> 00:34:03.634]  They didn't get upset about issues, of course, that you exposed about how they're now going to run the nuclear scanning equipment in the Bahamas.
[00:34:03.654 --> 00:34:07.717]  I mean, systematically, it's not just the illegal aliens.
[00:34:08.117 --> 00:34:09.538]  It's not just getting rid of our borders.
[00:34:09.598 --> 00:34:12.940]  It's not just Spanish companies taking over and setting up toll roads.
[00:34:13.341 --> 00:34:15.602]  At every level, the globalists are taking over.
[00:34:15.642 --> 00:34:18.324]  Can you give us your take on that and cover any issues you think are important?
[00:34:18.897 --> 00:34:26.080]  Well, first of all, the illegal immigration thing is really, it's finally resonating with most of the American people.
[00:34:26.120 --> 00:34:32.182]  I'm told 92% are people who want the borders closed and want the illegal immigration to stop.
[00:34:32.222 --> 00:34:35.223]  That's right, it was 87% last year, now it's up in the 90s.
[00:34:35.243 --> 00:34:36.483]  Yeah, and that's good.
[00:34:37.524 --> 00:34:45.907]  I believe this Dubai Ports thing was a diversion to get people's minds off it, to get people's minds off the immigration thing, and it did for a time.
[00:34:46.621 --> 00:34:50.684]  You know, we've got ports that are practically dominated by the Communist Chinese.
[00:34:51.245 --> 00:34:58.090]  Why should we get upset about a few that are going to be administered or directed by Dubai?
[00:34:58.510 --> 00:35:02.013]  Well, you know, I would prefer that they're all in U.S.
[00:35:02.053 --> 00:35:02.433]  hands.
[00:35:03.174 --> 00:35:04.054]  No doubt about that.
[00:35:04.595 --> 00:35:06.516]  But what are the issues today?
[00:35:07.097 --> 00:35:10.059]  Absolutely, the United Nations has to be the key issue.
[00:35:11.906 --> 00:35:15.928]  Alex, you're probably aware of the Security and Prosperity Partnership?
[00:35:16.308 --> 00:35:16.588]  Yes.
[00:35:17.029 --> 00:35:24.572]  Alright, this came out of the Council on Foreign Relations, and it's a publication that they had called, Building a North American Community.
[00:35:25.353 --> 00:35:36.678]  And Fox of Mexico, and Bush of our country, and Premier Martin of Canada, who's now been replaced by a guy named Harper, they met in March of 2005, and they adopted this as their program.
[00:35:37.279 --> 00:35:41.461]  And the way they treat the border problem is to abolish the borders.
[00:35:42.735 --> 00:35:43.475]  I kid you not.
[00:35:43.716 --> 00:35:45.136]  This is what they are suggesting.
[00:35:45.296 --> 00:35:53.659]  That came out about a year ago, even when Dobbs said this is global government and an American Union.
[00:35:54.619 --> 00:36:00.601]  He said it was mind-boggling, and I don't think it's mind-boggling if you understand the conspiracy and what they're trying to accomplish.
[00:36:01.262 --> 00:36:07.264]  This came about because the John Birch Society was so effective in blocking the FTAA
[00:36:08.208 --> 00:36:12.972]  That President Bush never brought it to Congress, as he promised for many years he would do in March of 2005.
[00:36:14.513 --> 00:36:21.258]  So, what they're going to do is implement this FTAA, which is the merger of 34 nations in the Western Hemisphere.
[00:36:21.278 --> 00:36:23.039]  They're doing it through regulatory moves.
[00:36:23.219 --> 00:36:27.322]  Well, they're doing it piecemeal, and one of the things they're doing here is this SPP.
[00:36:27.803 --> 00:36:37.730]  And what they intend here is to cease having three countries, Canada, the U.S., and Mexico, and call it one entity here, the North American Community.
[00:36:38.303 --> 00:36:40.104]  And Lou Dobbs was very upset about this.
[00:36:40.344 --> 00:36:41.165]  Good, I'm glad.
[00:36:41.225 --> 00:36:50.671]  I'm glad somebody in the mass media finally got a hold of these ideas that are going on so that the American people can be apprised of it and start to block them.
[00:36:51.331 --> 00:36:52.712]  Mr. McManus, I want to digress.
[00:36:52.752 --> 00:36:56.474]  President of the John Birch Society for a second and go back because I don't want to just move past this quickly.
[00:36:56.774 --> 00:36:57.555]  This is central.
[00:36:57.955 --> 00:37:06.080]  To show the power of the 2600 member Council on Foreign Relations founded by the British in 1922 in New York City at Pratt House
[00:37:06.540 --> 00:37:06.960]  Okay, well,
[00:37:35.656 --> 00:37:37.097]  You've got to bring you up to date a little bit.
[00:37:37.117 --> 00:37:42.620]  There are 4,200 members of the Council on Foreign Relations today, and 500 of them in the U.S.
[00:37:42.660 --> 00:37:43.060]  government.
[00:37:43.080 --> 00:37:46.462]  They've grown by over 1,800 in just the last two years?
[00:37:46.662 --> 00:37:49.823]  No, no, I think your figures go back quite a few years.
[00:37:49.843 --> 00:38:02.610]  I wrote a little book called The Insiders, and it's the CFR trilateral domination of the last five administrations, and we published the entire membership list of the Council on Foreign Relations as an appendix.
[00:38:03.186 --> 00:38:05.787]  And the entire membership of the Trilateral Commission.
[00:38:06.407 --> 00:38:17.852]  Anybody who's interested in that can contact the John Birch Society on the internet, jbs.org, or you can call our 800 number, 1-800-JBS-USA1.
[00:38:18.052 --> 00:38:19.813]  So they're lying on their website?
[00:38:19.973 --> 00:38:24.174]  I mean, a few months ago they said 2,600 members, they've actually expanded?
[00:38:24.214 --> 00:38:25.755]  They have 4,274 members.
[00:38:26.055 --> 00:38:28.176]  I got that figure out of their annual report.
[00:38:28.860 --> 00:38:38.425]  In fact, I occasionally get down to New York City, and anybody who's in New York City can go to the Council on Foreign Relations headquarters and walk in and ask for an annual report, and they'll give it to you.
[00:38:38.545 --> 00:38:40.085]  Now, I got one of those about four years ago.
[00:38:40.105 --> 00:38:41.506]  In fact, I'll even mail you one.
[00:38:41.926 --> 00:38:42.847]  Well, no, I got it.
[00:38:43.207 --> 00:38:48.309]  I've got them going all the way back into the 60s, and it's quite a thing to be able to look and see the growth of this.
[00:38:48.469 --> 00:38:58.154]  Well, tell people who the CFR are, because for those that don't know, we're actually... Well, the Council on Foreign Relations, it was begun when the United States Senate said no to the League of Nations.
[00:38:58.891 --> 00:39:07.193]  And the man who was behind it was the man who was President Wilson's top aide, his advisor, his guru, a man named Edward Mandel House.
[00:39:08.053 --> 00:39:14.574]  And when they were in Paris, where House and his young lieutenants, and they were working on the Versailles Treaty, when they got the word that the U.S.
[00:39:14.614 --> 00:39:17.595]  Senate said no to the League of Nations, that was 1919.
[00:39:19.336 --> 00:39:21.336]  So they got together with British counterparts.
[00:39:22.077 --> 00:39:25.862]  And the two groups formed organizations for their respective countries.
[00:39:25.942 --> 00:39:28.786]  The British formed the Royal Institute for International Affairs.
[00:39:29.387 --> 00:39:31.931]  The Americans formed the Council on Foreign Relations.
[00:39:32.652 --> 00:39:37.078]  Now that was House and his young lieutenants, John Foster Dulles, Alan Dulles,
[00:39:37.620 --> 00:39:40.683]  Sumner Wells, Walter Lippmann, Christian Herder, and so forth.
[00:39:41.164 --> 00:39:44.868]  Two of those men that I just named eventually became Secretaries of State.
[00:39:45.168 --> 00:39:45.929]  CIA.
[00:39:46.009 --> 00:39:48.231]  Head of the CIA, and so forth.
[00:39:48.251 --> 00:40:00.224]  Now, the Council on Foreign Relations, right from day one, promoting the notion of world government, scrapped the Declaration of Independence, scrapped the Constitution, bring about an imperial presidency.
[00:40:00.854 --> 00:40:08.225]  And they began to take over the State Department in the late 30s with the stimulus of Franklin Roosevelt.
[00:40:08.946 --> 00:40:10.688]  Every Secretary of State since 1949
[00:40:12.768 --> 00:40:17.711]  When Dean Acheson was the Secretary of State, has been a member of the Council on Foreign Relations.
[00:40:18.131 --> 00:40:19.552]  That's an incredible statement.
[00:40:19.832 --> 00:40:25.876]  Now, they have the heads of banking, industry, media, government, and they all work in concert.
[00:40:26.156 --> 00:40:28.357]  Right, in the academic world, don't leave that out.
[00:40:28.517 --> 00:40:32.079]  There's almost 800 professors or college administrators.
[00:40:32.099 --> 00:40:36.602]  You send your child off to college to get an American education, and no, he doesn't.
[00:40:36.642 --> 00:40:37.823]  He gets this international
[00:40:38.263 --> 00:40:39.744]  Globalism and so forth.
[00:40:39.884 --> 00:40:48.069]  Now, 20 years ago, you guys at the John Birch Society would talk about global government out of their own documents, and you're called conspiracy theories over a decade ago.
[00:40:48.149 --> 00:40:48.789]  I'm called that.
[00:40:49.030 --> 00:40:52.131]  While they're openly calling for it, now they're not even denying it.
[00:40:52.572 --> 00:40:56.994]  Well, what they're denying is what the goal really is, so it's still a conspiracy.
[00:40:57.475 --> 00:41:01.257]  Conspiracy, secret plot among more than one person for an evil purpose.
[00:41:01.860 --> 00:41:07.483]  Now, you can come around and you can say, yes, I'm a globalist, and I think that the world ought to be under one single government, and so forth.
[00:41:08.143 --> 00:41:12.405]  And, you know, you're open about it and so forth, but you're not telling what the real goal is.
[00:41:12.465 --> 00:41:17.787]  The real goal is, you are going to be the leader in a tyranny, and you're going to suppress the freedom of everybody.
[00:41:17.867 --> 00:41:23.050]  What will life be like under the one world government, which they've already got a lot of it in place, if they succeed?
[00:41:23.530 --> 00:41:24.590]  Just like it's in China.
[00:41:25.611 --> 00:41:25.911]  Alright?
[00:41:26.711 --> 00:41:27.111]  Tyranny.
[00:41:27.692 --> 00:41:28.492]  Absolute tyranny.
[00:41:29.649 --> 00:41:31.330]  Freedom of speech is denied over there.
[00:41:31.370 --> 00:41:33.532]  They're suppressing publications.
[00:41:34.093 --> 00:41:35.994]  Freedom of life is denied.
[00:41:36.115 --> 00:41:42.660]  Freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, freedom of all the freedoms that we Americans take for granted.
[00:41:43.041 --> 00:41:44.742]  And you know, we didn't get these from government.
[00:41:45.443 --> 00:41:48.826]  The philosophy of the American system is in the Declaration of Independence.
[00:41:48.886 --> 00:41:49.607]  Very simple.
[00:41:50.146 --> 00:41:55.907]  Men are endowed by their Creator with rights, and to secure these rights, governments are instituted.
[00:41:56.267 --> 00:41:57.647]  Everything's in its proper order here.
[00:41:57.687 --> 00:42:04.029]  And when they become destructive of those aims, it is our right and duty to abolish the forms that we are accustomed to and replace them.
[00:42:04.049 --> 00:42:05.529]  Well, we don't have to abolish the form.
[00:42:05.589 --> 00:42:06.229]  It's still there.
[00:42:06.269 --> 00:42:07.669]  What we've got to do is get back to it.
[00:42:08.029 --> 00:42:12.750]  We've got to have American people... But I'm saying the Declaration of Independence clearly says that if a government becomes destructive... That's right.
[00:42:12.910 --> 00:42:15.171]  ...we can abolish it and repair it.
[00:42:15.331 --> 00:42:17.471]  That's right, and that's why they separated from England.
[00:42:18.092 --> 00:42:20.915]  And so they started this system here, and we still have this system.
[00:42:20.935 --> 00:42:26.359]  If we got back to the Constitution, the government of the United States would be 20% its size and 20% its cost.
[00:42:26.780 --> 00:42:31.744]  Now, John F. McManus, president of the John Birch Society, you're going to be speaking tomorrow night at the Holiday Inn.
[00:42:31.804 --> 00:42:33.606]  Hey, I'm speaking tonight in Waco, too.
[00:42:34.086 --> 00:42:34.947]  Oh, tell us about that.
[00:42:35.247 --> 00:42:39.491]  I'm speaking at the Hilton in Waco, and I think it's at 7 o'clock.
[00:42:40.231 --> 00:42:42.894]  I think people can find that pretty easily in Waco.
[00:42:43.447 --> 00:42:44.928]  And they can get tickets there at the door?
[00:42:45.488 --> 00:42:46.629]  Yeah, tickets at the door.
[00:42:47.410 --> 00:42:49.951]  My companion here just raised up his fingers.
[00:42:49.991 --> 00:42:51.072]  He said it's at 8 o'clock.
[00:42:51.132 --> 00:42:52.233]  So it's not at 7 o'clock.
[00:42:52.713 --> 00:42:53.794]  But I'll be giving this talk.
[00:42:53.834 --> 00:42:58.137]  Now what I do in this talk is first thing I show is a 32 minute video that we just produced.
[00:42:58.775 --> 00:43:00.536]  Which is about the roots of our country.
[00:43:00.576 --> 00:43:03.498]  The fact that we're a republic and not a democracy.
[00:43:03.939 --> 00:43:11.544]  Get into the economic sphere and show that monopoly capitalism versus free enterprise capitalism is the real thrust here.
[00:43:12.084 --> 00:43:13.685]  How did our country come to be?
[00:43:13.825 --> 00:43:15.627]  And what did our founding fathers think about it?
[00:43:15.647 --> 00:43:17.288]  And what's the importance of morality?
[00:43:17.668 --> 00:43:18.969]  That's a 30-minute video.
[00:43:19.009 --> 00:43:26.234]  We show that and then I come back and I talk about, okay, it's a conspiracy that's doing this to us and taking away from us our heritage.
[00:43:27.163 --> 00:43:27.724]  Who are they?
[00:43:28.064 --> 00:43:28.925]  Where do they come from?
[00:43:29.285 --> 00:43:30.306]  What is the continuity?
[00:43:30.667 --> 00:43:46.843]  And I start 200 years ago and show through the Illuminati and the Carbonari in Italy and Marx and House and Wilson and Roosevelt and so forth right up till today, the goal that they have and always have had is world government to destroy individual nations.
[00:43:47.604 --> 00:43:48.545]  Now, Mr. McManus,
[00:43:49.514 --> 00:43:55.521]  I've got a few other key questions here for you that I'd be remiss if I didn't bring them up because we have a lot of listeners that have this question.
[00:43:55.541 --> 00:43:58.625]  We've gotten already a lot of calls and people are wanting to call them.
[00:43:58.645 --> 00:44:04.612]  We're not going to take any calls, but I want to talk about the future of the John Birch Society later in the last segment that's coming up.
[00:44:04.913 --> 00:44:08.938]  I want to get into ideas that you have for solutions, but first off,
[00:44:09.762 --> 00:44:12.784]  I want you to understand that I have a Big Ten approach.
[00:44:12.984 --> 00:44:13.885]  I promote everybody.
[00:44:14.265 --> 00:44:16.506]  I believe in everybody that's fighting the New World Order.
[00:44:17.066 --> 00:44:23.830]  Even if we don't all totally agree on how to do that, how to implement it, I think the John Birch Society has been invaluable.
[00:44:26.872 --> 00:44:37.819]  In setting bushfires in the minds of men in the early days, and so much of the fight against the globalists we see today that's huge, tens of millions of people, is in part thanks to the John Birch Society.
[00:44:38.159 --> 00:44:45.324]  But we've heard that there's been some shake-ups at the JBS and maybe a new direction, a more aggressive direction coming.
[00:44:45.364 --> 00:44:49.187]  Can you tell the listeners about some of the changes that have happened at the JBS?
[00:44:49.667 --> 00:44:54.510]  Well, very quickly, our CEO was let loose back in October.
[00:44:55.451 --> 00:44:57.114]  I was reinserted as president.
[00:44:57.194 --> 00:44:59.477]  I had been downgraded for a while.
[00:44:59.517 --> 00:45:02.001]  We've got a new CEO, Art Thompson.
[00:45:02.041 --> 00:45:04.465]  We've hired something that we've never done before.
[00:45:04.525 --> 00:45:06.247]  We've hired a public affairs guy.
[00:45:06.648 --> 00:45:08.871]  We've hired a marketing manager.
[00:45:09.372 --> 00:45:10.173]  And we're really
[00:45:10.822 --> 00:45:14.164]  determined to put the John Birch Society back on the map again.
[00:45:14.965 --> 00:45:16.226]  And now you're out on the road?
[00:45:16.246 --> 00:45:22.930]  I mean, that's always been the complaint, is this isn't the old JBS that's aggressive, that's traveling the country, that's fighting legislation?
[00:45:22.950 --> 00:45:24.091]  I mean, you always were.
[00:45:24.111 --> 00:45:30.875]  I wouldn't say you guys were dormant, you just weren't as aggressive as we'd seen you in the past.
[00:45:31.575 --> 00:45:34.797]  We had developed the opposite of a Big Tent approach.
[00:45:35.358 --> 00:45:38.600]  And I'm glad to hear you say that you have the Big Tent approach.
[00:45:39.546 --> 00:45:42.168]  The John Birch Society is going to have the big tent approach now.
[00:45:42.689 --> 00:45:47.092]  We've got an umbrella and we're going to make it a lot bigger and get a lot more people under the umbrella.
[00:45:47.152 --> 00:45:53.116]  Well, I'll tell you, sir, if I see those changes and I do see them developing, I'd like to get involved and support you guys.
[00:45:53.396 --> 00:45:55.758]  Now let me bring up my second point and then we can move on.
[00:45:58.263 --> 00:46:22.567]  I met William F. Jasper in 1999 during Urban Warrior in Oakland, California, and I'd seen articles in your magazine, your great magazine, that I agree with 98% of, saying, oh, it's a conspiracy theory, there are no black helicopters, when I had gotten the Associated Press to write about urban warfare in Texas, I'd interviewed police chiefs that had thrown them out, attempted bribery, blowing up things, terrorizing people, so I talked to
[00:46:23.167 --> 00:46:41.995]  Jasper, and then a month later I saw the AP article printed in your publication, so I guess he really didn't know, and so when he found out it was true, you guys did reverse course, so I thought, well they're good guys, because when I gave him the Associated Press news article on that hilltop, with tanks and troops below us training to put Americans in camps, it was then in your publication.
[00:46:42.035 --> 00:46:48.337]  So I had a good feeling for you guys on that, and then I'm not attacking Jasper, but I asked him to come on to respond to it.
[00:46:48.797 --> 00:46:50.618]  Davon Kleist never worked for me.
[00:46:51.078 --> 00:46:52.179]  Davon Kleist, I
[00:46:53.691 --> 00:46:58.433]  I didn't send him to Oregon during the whole thing with the water rights.
[00:47:00.814 --> 00:47:03.515]  I just want you to know that that was incorrect.
[00:47:03.835 --> 00:47:08.497]  And then on the whole 9-11 thing that Jasper put out, I really think was kind of a straw man.
[00:47:08.997 --> 00:47:15.519]  So number one, are you guys going to start looking at 9-11 and start looking at some of the questions there?
[00:47:15.539 --> 00:47:17.300]  I mean, is that going to be part of the change of direction?
[00:47:17.720 --> 00:47:19.421]  Well, we've been looking at it all along.
[00:47:20.241 --> 00:47:29.127]  And if we can document and prove some things that a lot of people are saying are actual, and if they're in fact provable, they haven't proven them to us.
[00:47:29.767 --> 00:47:33.069]  We know that there are a lot of unanswered questions about 9-1-1.
[00:47:33.570 --> 00:47:35.271]  And we're looking into it all the time.
[00:47:35.731 --> 00:47:38.293]  We have some people that will spend more time on that.
[00:47:38.993 --> 00:47:44.857]  If we come to a position that substantially agrees with some of the claims that are being made, then you'll see it.
[00:47:45.287 --> 00:47:47.149]  But we're very careful, very cautious.
[00:47:47.530 --> 00:47:49.692]  We haven't been persuaded completely on this.
[00:47:49.773 --> 00:47:51.995]  We know that there are a lot of unanswered questions.
[00:47:52.516 --> 00:47:54.418]  One of the big questions, of course, is Building 7.
[00:47:54.859 --> 00:47:55.680]  What happened to that?
[00:47:56.361 --> 00:48:00.206]  There's no way that that was impacted by any airplanes.
[00:48:00.959 --> 00:48:02.880]  Yes, there's a lot of unanswered questions.
[00:48:02.900 --> 00:48:05.660]  We will revisit the subject.
[00:48:05.940 --> 00:48:13.382]  Well, great, because I understand if you guys didn't come out and say it's an inside job because you're studying it.
[00:48:13.402 --> 00:48:20.044]  I mean, you guys did come out and expose Oklahoma City with Quentin's fingerprints all over it, and you were trailblazers on that, and I appreciate it.
[00:48:20.424 --> 00:48:30.067]  My whole point is that I'm here laying down, being nice, never attacked you guys back, when I would characterize the last 9-11 story about myself and others
[00:48:31.308 --> 00:48:39.973]  I'm not trying to be nasty here, it just freaked out a lot of our listeners who are big supporters of you guys, and I think that goes a long way towards more trust with folks.
[00:48:40.613 --> 00:48:46.217]  Would you say that the hit pieces might have been fostered by previous management, or what's going on?
[00:48:46.497 --> 00:48:48.158]  Well, that's a possibility, yes.
[00:48:49.318 --> 00:48:53.721]  We're still finding out some things about previous leadership here that we're stunned by it.
[00:48:55.754 --> 00:48:59.975]  We were being misled ourselves, so we're going to be a little more careful about that.
[00:48:59.995 --> 00:49:10.759]  Now we have a new CEO named Art Thompson, who's a long-time friend of mine and a long-time veteran in the Birch Society, and it's he and I and a couple of other people have decided, okay,
[00:49:11.192 --> 00:49:12.473]  We're going to have the big tent now.
[00:49:12.493 --> 00:49:14.075]  We're going to revisit some subjects.
[00:49:14.095 --> 00:49:25.668]  We're going to get back into trying to regain the enthusiasm of some people that may have been a little bit dissuaded by the Birch Society becoming insular.
[00:49:26.503 --> 00:49:27.344]  We're not going to do that.
[00:49:56.744 --> 00:49:57.726]  I'll get on the same page.
[00:49:58.006 --> 00:49:59.448]  Okay, well that's very good of you.
[00:49:59.469 --> 00:50:00.250]  I appreciate that.
[00:50:00.450 --> 00:50:03.455]  And yes, there will be changes.
[00:50:03.515 --> 00:50:05.960]  People will notice changes in the Birch Society.
[00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:10.267]  They'll notice some changes in the New American Magazine, which is our publication.
[00:50:10.911 --> 00:50:14.634]  And certainly they're going to notice some changes in the videos that we're putting out.
[00:50:14.674 --> 00:50:16.535]  We're not going to put out talking heads anymore.
[00:50:16.555 --> 00:50:19.357]  It's going to be some really impressive stuff.
[00:50:19.497 --> 00:50:20.638]  Well, I think you're talking head videos.
[00:50:20.658 --> 00:50:24.120]  You know, I've played many of them here on the local cable system over a decade ago.
[00:50:24.440 --> 00:50:25.741]  Talks you've given that are excellent.
[00:50:25.761 --> 00:50:32.046]  So, I mean, I think those are good, but certainly, you know... Well, we've got to reach a wider audience, and you can't reach them with talking heads.
[00:50:32.066 --> 00:50:34.207]  A lot of the people, you know, you've got to stimulate them somehow.
[00:50:34.227 --> 00:50:34.868]  No, I agree, sir.
[00:50:34.908 --> 00:50:36.489]  I make films that aren't talking heads.
[00:50:37.269 --> 00:50:40.511]  I'm just saying I think your past work can't be marked down.
[00:50:40.651 --> 00:50:41.591]  Well, thank you for that.
[00:50:42.132 --> 00:50:43.553]  Well, I think the information is excellent.
[00:50:43.833 --> 00:50:44.193]  Stay there.
[00:50:44.213 --> 00:50:47.955]  I want to talk about solutions in our final segment with John F. McManus.
[00:50:48.435 --> 00:50:50.856]  And I would have been remiss if I hadn't brought up those other points.
[00:50:50.916 --> 00:50:54.178]  And I'm really encouraged by your response, sir.
[00:50:54.238 --> 00:50:55.539]  So I commend you.
[00:50:55.579 --> 00:50:59.521]  I know you can't tell us too much of what went on behind the scenes, but I think you gave us a pretty clear picture.
[00:51:01.423 --> 00:51:05.768]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:51:05.968 --> 00:51:10.313]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:51:12.295 --> 00:51:14.917]  To use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:51:14.957 --> 00:51:16.378]  The New World Order.
[00:51:17.038 --> 00:51:17.738]  Panama.
[00:51:18.079 --> 00:51:22.301]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:51:22.361 --> 00:51:29.286]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:51:29.426 --> 00:51:31.427]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:51:31.687 --> 00:51:42.211]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:51:42.431 --> 00:51:47.773]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[00:55:32.824 --> 00:55:33.285]  Don't wait.
[00:55:33.625 --> 00:55:34.666]  Expose the New World Order.
[00:55:35.206 --> 00:55:37.468]  John F. McManus, President of the John Birch Society.
[00:55:37.488 --> 00:55:39.109]  This has been a really great interview.
[00:55:39.449 --> 00:55:40.990]  The last four minutes we've got together.
[00:55:41.010 --> 00:55:44.792]  Would you like to plug any websites or give us any solutions or ideas you have?
[00:55:44.852 --> 00:55:46.353]  And of course, one final question.
[00:55:46.393 --> 00:55:47.974]  Do you think we can win this fight, sir?
[00:55:48.655 --> 00:55:51.657]  Have we at least slowed down their plan for global empire?
[00:55:52.546 --> 00:55:57.830]  Yes, and the tactic that we recommend here is we take our country back through the House of Representatives.
[00:55:58.130 --> 00:56:02.073]  The presidency, both political parties, locked up.
[00:56:02.233 --> 00:56:10.959]  Council on Foreign Relations, and that's part of my speech, I go through and show Council on Foreign Relations candidates from both political parties from the fifties right up through delay.
[00:56:11.739 --> 00:56:14.381]  Alright, so why the House of Representatives?
[00:56:14.481 --> 00:56:19.885]  Because the House, the Constitution says all bills for raising revenue shall begin in the House.
[00:56:20.598 --> 00:56:31.083]  And if the House will not initiate a bill to fund the UN, education, foreign aid, or anything else, there's nothing the Senate, the President, the Supreme Court, or anybody else can do about it.
[00:56:31.523 --> 00:56:37.266]  We take our country back through the House of Representatives, then the Senate, then the Presidency down the road.
[00:56:37.306 --> 00:56:38.246]  Now, can it be done?
[00:56:39.206 --> 00:56:43.108]  In 1997, there was a vote in the House of Representatives to get us out of the UN.
[00:56:43.228 --> 00:56:44.769]  Fifty-four voted for it.
[00:56:45.430 --> 00:56:47.151]  Two years later, 74.
[00:56:47.431 --> 00:56:48.271]  Two years later, 83.
[00:56:48.692 --> 00:56:51.433]  Are we gaining on the rascals?
[00:56:51.553 --> 00:56:52.814]  Yes, indeed we are.
[00:56:53.394 --> 00:56:56.495]  And so, what we have to do is more of what we're doing.
[00:56:56.675 --> 00:57:00.257]  Waking the town, telling the people, organizing at the local level.
[00:57:00.817 --> 00:57:04.979]  I would love to see John Burt Society chapters in communities across the country.
[00:57:05.460 --> 00:57:06.480]  And it's happening.
[00:57:06.600 --> 00:57:09.842]  There are more people now looking at what the John Burt Society is doing.
[00:57:09.862 --> 00:57:11.743]  They're getting our literature.
[00:57:12.183 --> 00:57:14.464]  I gave a speech on C-SPAN just a week ago.
[00:57:15.277 --> 00:57:30.361]  And the entire hour-long speech on the subject of immigration, illegal immigration, and C-SPAN covered it, broadcast it nationwide, and we got a tremendous surge of interest on the Internet.
[00:57:30.921 --> 00:57:32.782]  So we're looking forward to more of that.
[00:57:33.182 --> 00:57:34.822]  And I'm glad to be on your show here.
[00:57:35.022 --> 00:57:41.304]  I've said to myself over the years, maybe we ought to try to develop a relationship with Alex Jones.
[00:57:42.085 --> 00:57:47.150]  I'm very pleased with the relationship that we've just begun, and I'm looking forward to having it continue.
[00:57:47.450 --> 00:57:47.830]  Yes, sir.
[00:57:47.870 --> 00:57:54.116]  Well, we really appreciate your fine work over the decades, your 42 years, 43 years with the John Birch Society.
[00:57:54.136 --> 00:57:55.537]  Why don't you give us those websites?
[00:57:56.338 --> 00:57:58.200]  JBS.org.
[00:57:58.460 --> 00:57:59.761]  That's pretty easy to remember.
[00:58:00.462 --> 00:58:01.763]  Or phone number 1-800-JBSUSA1.
[00:58:06.266 --> 00:58:12.721]  Possibly the thing that you'd want most to start off with is a little book I wrote called The Insiders, and I'm going to send you a copy of it, Alex.
[00:58:13.473 --> 00:58:17.654]  And it contains up-to-date information about the Council on Foreign Relations.
[00:58:17.674 --> 00:58:18.394]  Fantastic.
[00:58:18.454 --> 00:58:24.296]  Well, I'm glad to hear you guys are back on track and have changed directions to the Big Ten approach.
[00:58:24.676 --> 00:58:27.397]  We need to know who the enemy is and believe that we can defeat them.
[00:58:27.437 --> 00:58:28.337]  And I know we can.
[00:58:28.357 --> 00:58:30.458]  Besides, John, we don't have a choice, do we?
[00:58:30.798 --> 00:58:31.878]  No, we don't have a choice.
[00:58:32.278 --> 00:58:33.739]  The choice is unthinkable.
[00:58:34.079 --> 00:58:36.340]  OK, you're speaking tonight in Waco.
[00:58:36.360 --> 00:58:37.840]  Tonight in Waco at the Hilton.
[00:58:37.940 --> 00:58:39.521]  Tomorrow night, you just said where.
[00:58:39.601 --> 00:58:40.341]  I forgot.
[00:58:40.361 --> 00:58:40.761]  We'll be back.
[00:58:41.261 --> 00:58:45.842]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[00:58:45.862 --> 00:58:46.382]  Big Brother.
[00:58:46.582 --> 00:58:47.362]  Mainstream media.
[00:58:47.382 --> 00:58:51.843]  Government cover-ups.
[00:58:52.924 --> 00:58:54.564]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.076 --> 00:59:04.977]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:04.997 --> 00:59:09.360]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.821 --> 00:59:13.924]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:14.865 --> 00:59:19.248]  Alright, finishing up with the president of the John Birch Society, who spent a lot of time with us today.
[00:59:19.288 --> 00:59:21.330]  We're thankful for that, John F. McManus.
[00:59:21.350 --> 00:59:26.394]  Tomorrow night, he'll be here in Austin, Texas, giving a speech.
[00:59:26.794 --> 00:59:29.096]  The holiday in Northwest 183 in Mopac at 7.30 p.m.
[00:59:32.106 --> 00:59:34.568]  And that is going to be just fantastic.
[00:59:35.449 --> 00:59:42.874]  And he's giving another speech tonight in Waco, and that's at 8 o'clock tonight, I believe you said at the Hilton, sir?
[00:59:43.214 --> 00:59:43.574]  Correct.
[00:59:44.375 --> 00:59:46.537]  And we've just got a few minutes left here in this segment.
[00:59:46.557 --> 00:59:47.617]  Sorry we cut you off short.
[00:59:47.637 --> 00:59:49.279]  They're up against that break.
[00:59:49.339 --> 00:59:51.260]  Any other closing comments you'd like to make?
[00:59:51.620 --> 00:59:54.002]  Well, it's a great country and we want to preserve it.
[00:59:54.222 --> 00:59:58.986]  We want the best for ourselves and our children and our generations yet to come.
[00:59:59.486 --> 01:00:00.787]  The United States is unique
[01:00:01.607 --> 01:00:05.609]  Started on a foundation of belief in God who gave us our rights.
[01:00:06.049 --> 01:00:11.672]  Government's purpose is to be negative, to limit the government itself and to keep the people free.
[01:00:11.692 --> 01:00:12.232]  And that's all.
[01:00:12.833 --> 01:00:13.593]  That's what we want.
[01:00:13.633 --> 01:00:14.834]  That's the positive side.
[01:00:14.994 --> 01:00:18.015]  The negative side is we have to fight against the conspiracy.
[01:00:18.656 --> 01:00:27.180]  So anybody who contacts the John Birch Society, jbs.org or call us 1-800-JBS-USA1.
[01:00:27.800 --> 01:00:29.201]  Free information for anybody.
[01:00:29.241 --> 01:00:30.542]  We're glad to hear from anybody.
[01:00:31.147 --> 01:00:35.388]  So contact us and take a look at what the John Birch Society is all about.
[01:00:35.408 --> 01:00:36.449]  Thank you very much.
[01:00:36.989 --> 01:00:37.469]  You bet, sir.
[01:00:37.509 --> 01:00:41.010]  Just in a final closing here, is it exciting to you?
[01:00:41.030 --> 01:00:45.971]  I mean, I'm seeing record amounts of people in government, out of government, that would never listen to us before.
[01:00:46.512 --> 01:00:50.533]  I mean, now it's not a hard sell to wake people up to this whole world government.
[01:00:50.833 --> 01:00:51.373]  That's right.
[01:00:52.573 --> 01:00:57.695]  And as Robert Welsh, the founder of the John Birch Society, said many years ago, there would be a crisis that would come
[01:00:58.283 --> 01:01:05.916]  And when the crisis came, we had to be ready to be able to mobilize all of the people who are awakened so that we can really turn things around.
[01:01:05.956 --> 01:01:07.478]  And maybe we're here.
[01:01:07.578 --> 01:01:09.121]  Maybe we're at that crisis point.
[01:01:09.591 --> 01:01:13.655]  But anyhow, we're ready in the Birch Society, and glad to know we have some allies.
[01:01:14.015 --> 01:01:17.458]  Well, that's the good news, is that always happens in history.
[01:01:17.498 --> 01:01:23.243]  Now that they're getting down to the final phase of world government, people are waking up, and they're scared.
[01:01:23.263 --> 01:01:27.086]  I mean, I think they're scared from our sources inside Bilderberg and the CFR.
[01:01:27.347 --> 01:01:29.689]  They seem to realize now that they could lose.
[01:01:30.169 --> 01:01:31.090]  Yes, yes.
[01:01:31.150 --> 01:01:37.915]  There's a lot of people who know something's wrong, and now we've got to get the moral instinct in them to say, OK, I see something's wrong.
[01:01:38.155 --> 01:01:39.576]  I've got to do something to make it right.
[01:01:39.836 --> 01:01:40.236]  All right.
[01:01:40.296 --> 01:01:48.222]  Well, John F. McManus speaking tonight in Waco at 8 o'clock at the Hilton, and tomorrow night at 7.30 at the Holiday Inn Northwest, $10 admission.
[01:01:48.803 --> 01:01:49.583]  We'll see you there.
[01:01:49.623 --> 01:01:50.284]  Thanks for joining us.
[01:01:50.524 --> 01:01:51.184]  Thanks very much.
[01:01:51.505 --> 01:01:51.845]  Take care.
[01:01:51.865 --> 01:01:52.025]  Bye-bye.
[01:01:53.210 --> 01:02:06.880]  Folks, listen, one of my dear friends called in earlier, who also was attacked by the previous JBS administration over 9-11, and wanted to come on and have a big fracas basically with McManus.
[01:02:07.720 --> 01:02:19.889]  You heard McManus, and I've talked to people internally, that the old administration may have been trying to do some bad things, clearly, and to cover up things, and to not let the truth out.
[01:02:20.555 --> 01:02:21.636]  That is now changing.
[01:02:21.676 --> 01:02:22.016]  You heard him.
[01:02:22.036 --> 01:02:23.597]  They're going to be probably getting into Building 7.
[01:02:24.338 --> 01:02:26.440]  Talking about 9-11 being an inside job.
[01:02:26.980 --> 01:02:28.341]  I mean, their members all believe that.
[01:02:28.721 --> 01:02:29.862]  Predominantly that I've talked to.
[01:02:30.363 --> 01:02:31.383]  And so there's a change.
[01:02:31.624 --> 01:02:33.785]  He and others from the old guard have been pushed back.
[01:02:34.366 --> 01:02:36.627]  The new crowd did some things I'm not even going to get into.
[01:02:36.667 --> 01:02:37.448]  Pretty bad stuff.
[01:02:38.069 --> 01:02:39.490]  And now they've been kicked back out.
[01:02:39.950 --> 01:02:48.737]  Now, I've never been a member of the JBS, but I know that some of the first books I read, some of the things that helped wake me up, some of the things that influenced my father back in the 60s were the JBS.
[01:02:48.777 --> 01:02:50.338]  Some of the things that influenced one of my uncles.
[01:02:50.896 --> 01:02:51.677]  And one of my aunts.
[01:02:51.737 --> 01:02:52.977]  And they've done a lot of good work.
[01:02:53.057 --> 01:03:03.504]  So, because I saw some weird things going on a few years ago and I was wrongfully attacked by the JBS Magazine, I chose to not give it attention.
[01:03:03.924 --> 01:03:05.485]  Which is what I normally do when I'm attacked.
[01:03:05.745 --> 01:03:07.346]  People are like, why don't you respond to this attack?
[01:03:07.366 --> 01:03:08.487]  Why don't you respond to that attack?
[01:03:08.867 --> 01:03:11.809]  People don't tune in here to hear about attacks.
[01:03:12.109 --> 01:03:13.350]  Because it's not about Alex Jones.
[01:03:14.424 --> 01:03:20.809]  When we get a chance to reverse that and wake up the leadership of the JBS and get them on board, that's an exciting thing.
[01:03:20.829 --> 01:03:29.116]  Wouldn't you rather have this powerful, ancient, as politics goes, organization on our side and fighting the New World Order and back on track?
[01:03:29.416 --> 01:03:33.259]  Would you rather just continue a huge chicken fight, flapping wings and squawking?
[01:03:35.709 --> 01:03:37.751]  And if people don't think I attacked them enough, c'est la vie.
[01:03:37.771 --> 01:03:38.512]  You want to attack me?
[01:03:38.752 --> 01:03:39.774]  Go ahead, I won't respond.
[01:03:40.134 --> 01:03:40.955]  Just get my name right.
[01:03:41.015 --> 01:03:41.776]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:03:42.156 --> 01:03:45.420]  My websites are Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:49.344]  Alright, we'll be right back with Michael Rivero of WhatReallyHappened.gov.
[01:03:54.542 --> 01:03:57.384]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[01:03:57.645 --> 01:03:59.226]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[01:03:59.566 --> 01:04:04.230]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[01:04:04.590 --> 01:04:11.336]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[01:04:11.656 --> 01:04:13.637]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has arisen.
[01:04:13.837 --> 01:04:16.658]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[01:04:16.778 --> 01:04:21.420]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[01:04:21.641 --> 01:04:26.023]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[01:04:26.283 --> 01:04:33.506]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that is sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[01:04:33.746 --> 01:04:36.167]  Discover the documentary for yourself before it's too late.

[01:04:55.587 --> 01:04:59.689]  You know murky water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[01:04:59.829 --> 01:05:02.710]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[01:05:02.790 --> 01:05:09.513]  The powerful black murky purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[01:05:09.693 --> 01:05:12.695]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[01:05:12.895 --> 01:05:15.296]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[01:05:15.416 --> 01:05:23.320]  Black murky elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as
[01:05:23.660 --> 01:05:34.884]  Methazine, Benzene, Chloride and Chloroform, MTBE, Radon 222, Foul taste and obnoxious odors like Sulfur, even Nitrates, and unwanted heavy metals such as Lead, Mercury and Aluminum are extracted.

[01:06:46.905 --> 01:06:50.127]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:07.276 --> 01:07:09.096]  Well, he joins us once a month.
[01:07:10.057 --> 01:07:11.737]  He's an amazing researcher.
[01:07:11.757 --> 01:07:19.799]  One of the first people on the web, back in its beginnings of becoming powerful.
[01:07:21.439 --> 01:07:25.880]  Michael Rivero exposed the Vince Foster murder, Bill Clinton, all that corruption.
[01:07:26.481 --> 01:07:29.281]  And he's just continued with 9-11, Oklahoma City, all of it.
[01:07:29.921 --> 01:07:36.603]  And WhatReallyHappened.com is one of the biggest alternative news sites out there, and we're so proud of the work of Michael Rivero.
[01:07:37.691 --> 01:07:40.412]  And I want to get his take on a host of issues.
[01:07:40.452 --> 01:07:52.158]  The war, the upcoming attack on Iran, when he thinks that'll happen, will it happen, what's happening with Bush saying he's above the law, what's happening with Scooter Libby and Roe being called back in.
[01:07:52.678 --> 01:07:56.600]  All the things that he thinks are most important and what he sees happening in the future.
[01:07:56.620 --> 01:08:00.641]  If you go to Infowars.com, you can link right through to WhatReallyHappened.com.
[01:08:00.701 --> 01:08:04.823]  And I hope to keep him through this hour and into the next if he's able to stay with us so we can take some calls.
[01:08:05.163 --> 01:08:06.264]  Mike, it's always good to have you on.
[01:08:06.824 --> 01:08:10.906]  Well, thanks for having me on, and yes, I'm going to be able to stay through into the second hour today.
[01:08:11.287 --> 01:08:11.987]  Fantastic!
[01:08:12.007 --> 01:08:16.249]  That way we can double up since we both crossed the wires last month and weren't able to get you on.
[01:08:16.930 --> 01:08:21.152]  Michael Rivero, out of the gates, what do you think is most important right now?
[01:08:21.632 --> 01:08:24.314]  And give us your take on what you think is going to happen in the next few months.
[01:08:25.074 --> 01:08:28.756]  Well, I think you covered it pretty well in your opening speech there.
[01:08:28.816 --> 01:08:34.940]  First and foremost, of course, it's very obvious that Bush and his associates are continuing their push for a war in Iran.
[01:08:35.836 --> 01:08:47.243]  We are continuing to see the propaganda, just blatant propaganda throughout the media basically rehashing the same sort of claims that we saw in the run-up to the war in Iraq.
[01:08:48.044 --> 01:09:00.792]  The claims are that Iran has this nuclear capability and of course what Iran actually has is a power station and they have the centrifuges for refining uranium to 3.5
[01:09:02.652 --> 01:09:28.310]  percent purity which is what you use for reactor fuel and they're trying to make it sound like just by switching from blend to puree on these centrifuges that Iran can get up to the 90 percent purity that they need for a nuclear weapon and of course it's really not quite that simple to make that leap from reactor fuel to nuclear weapons material but of course this is the myth that is being pushed right now
[01:09:29.236 --> 01:09:34.201]  And Bush is going around saying Iran is failing to meet its obligations.
[01:09:34.662 --> 01:09:37.064]  But you have to go back and say, what obligations?
[01:09:37.144 --> 01:09:42.069]  Because both the United States and Iran have signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.
[01:09:42.530 --> 01:09:46.594]  And under the terms of that treaty, all fining nations have the right
[01:09:47.122 --> 01:09:54.112]  To use nuclear power for power generation for electricity and they have the right to make the fuel for those reactors.
[01:09:54.533 --> 01:10:00.602]  So Iran is perfectly within the letter of the law as spelled out in a treaty that the United States has signed.
[01:10:01.041 --> 01:10:19.951]  So what Bush has in effect done here is just completely thrown out, arbitrarily thrown out, the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty to say, well, we don't think Iran should have power reactors, and we don't think they should have the means to make fuel rods for those reactors, because somewhere down the road they might want to think about maybe making a nuclear bomb.
[01:10:20.372 --> 01:10:24.033]  And of course this is the same kind of thing that we were talking about going into Iraq.
[01:10:24.074 --> 01:10:24.774]  They started out
[01:10:25.235 --> 01:10:26.077]  We're good to go.
[01:10:33.011 --> 01:10:44.897]  And, of course, that's a really ridiculous argument, because you can look at any nation on Earth and say, boy, they might have weapons of mass destruction at some point in the future, therefore we should drop our weapons of mass destruction on them now.
[01:10:45.157 --> 01:10:54.882]  Well, John Negroponte, the new head of the Stasi of, quote, all intelligence, the death squad founder who set up death squads in Iraq, and of course decades before in Latin America,
[01:10:56.255 --> 01:11:07.780]  He knows that the CIA's own assessment last year, their official assessment, said 10 years, if they were given the centrifuges they needed for the 90 plus percent enrichment process, it's not like making a ham sandwich.
[01:11:08.300 --> 01:11:18.565]  So he says, yeah, it's true they're not going to get an A-bomb with what they've got currently, but they're going to buy an A-bomb from somebody and hit us.
[01:11:18.605 --> 01:11:21.466]  Then meanwhile, so I want you to comment on that, meanwhile,
[01:11:22.563 --> 01:11:33.770]  Bush signed W199I, ordering the FBI and CIA and Defense Intelligence to quote, back off Al Qaeda and Hamas in this country, because it was really their provocateurs, they weren't Al Qaeda or Hamas.
[01:11:34.637 --> 01:11:40.521]  And then at the same time, they told him to back off Khan Laboratories that for decades had been producing this.
[01:11:40.561 --> 01:11:42.683]  Now Pakistan has a whole bunch of A-bombs.
[01:11:43.103 --> 01:11:47.105]  And then Bush goes and signs a deal with India to produce as many nukes as they want.
[01:11:48.026 --> 01:11:49.767]  Meanwhile, North Korea is threatening the nukes.
[01:11:50.107 --> 01:11:51.488]  China is running around threatening us.
[01:11:51.528 --> 01:11:58.293]  But we're supposed to ignore all that and go after Iran just because they happen to have a whole bunch of oil.
[01:11:59.554 --> 01:12:00.715]  Uh, yeah, very much.
[01:12:00.895 --> 01:12:08.283]  And what you were talking about, you know, with Iran buying a nuke and hit us with that, the big question is why would they be so foolish?
[01:12:08.584 --> 01:12:15.972]  And this was an argument that also applied to Iraq, because everyone was going on saying, oh, they're going to send a nuclear bomb over here and hit us.
[01:12:16.317 --> 01:12:21.801]  Well, the United States possesses the world's greatest nuclear deterrent force.
[01:12:21.941 --> 01:12:27.325]  We have the capability to go to any nation on Earth and turn it into a solid green glass parking lot.
[01:12:27.345 --> 01:12:30.267]  Now, why doesn't Russia, why doesn't China nuke us if they've got nukes?
[01:12:30.287 --> 01:12:33.810]  Because it's called MAD, Mutually Assured Destruction.
[01:12:33.830 --> 01:12:34.891]  The whole thing is a fraud.
[01:12:35.631 --> 01:12:41.996]  Absolutely, because our parents' generation forked over $5 trillion to build all these nuclear weapons and missiles
[01:12:42.367 --> 01:12:46.569]  On the idea that this would prevent some other nation with nuclear weapons from attacking us.
[01:12:46.949 --> 01:12:55.572]  Well, if this doesn't work, if this nuclear deterrent isn't scaring Iraq and Iran from attacking us, then we're owed a refund on all of that.
[01:12:55.852 --> 01:13:07.296]  But if the deterrent really works as advertised, then Iran can have all the nuclear weapons it wants, it'll put them on parades, it'll put them in a museum, it won't dare use them on the United States.
[01:13:07.376 --> 01:13:09.337]  So Iran is not a threat to the United States,
[01:13:09.757 --> 01:13:14.400]  Iraq was never a threat to the United States, even if they had had weapons of mass destruction.
[01:13:14.420 --> 01:13:15.880]  Well, let's get down to brass tacks.
[01:13:15.920 --> 01:13:20.042]  Every time Bush attacks somebody, his approval rating goes up for six months a year.
[01:13:20.623 --> 01:13:26.806]  So, going into these elections, he needs to go ahead and launch the attack and try to rally the people back home.
[01:13:26.946 --> 01:13:29.567]  But, that may not be enough.
[01:13:30.108 --> 01:13:32.789]  There's talk of impeachment already building.
[01:13:33.109 --> 01:13:38.092]  Michael Rivero, how much... I think we're in the greatest danger we've been in since September 11th.
[01:13:39.662 --> 01:13:41.443]  2001 at 9 o'clock in the morning.
[01:13:41.984 --> 01:13:52.789]  I think we're in the greatest danger we've been in since then of the crime cabal that controls Bush setting off an A-bomb, releasing biological weapons, blowing something up overseas.
[01:13:52.809 --> 01:13:53.470]  Do you concur?
[01:13:54.210 --> 01:14:03.395]  I absolutely do because Bush is cornered because of the rather unexpected development of the impeachment petitions now in three state legislatures.
[01:14:04.245 --> 01:14:18.993]  This kind of caught a lot of people by surprise because under Section 603 of the rules of the House of Representatives, impeachment proceedings against the President of the United States may be initiated by a joint resolution of any one state legislature.
[01:14:19.053 --> 01:14:23.595]  This is a rule that's never been used before, but it is in Jefferson's rules for the House of Representatives.
[01:14:23.635 --> 01:14:27.257]  Well, it's part of the Electoral College, and that's why we have states' rights.
[01:14:28.126 --> 01:14:29.087]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:14:29.167 --> 01:14:34.132]  And so, Illinois now has a bill before their legislature calling for the impeachment of Bill Clinton.
[01:14:34.452 --> 01:14:38.315]  California followed with one, not only for, I'm sorry, for George Bush.
[01:14:39.316 --> 01:14:43.941]  And California followed for one, not only for George Bush, but Dick Cheney as well.
[01:14:44.401 --> 01:14:49.025]  And most recently, of course, Vermont's state legislature is now looking at such a bill.
[01:14:49.606 --> 01:14:53.129]  And the report is that more states are going to follow the bill.
[01:14:54.634 --> 01:14:54.894]  Two?
[01:14:55.275 --> 01:14:57.358]  I think Hawaii's considering it now.
[01:14:58.519 --> 01:14:59.881]  I'd heard word about that.
[01:14:59.981 --> 01:15:00.962]  It's not confirmed yet.
[01:15:01.002 --> 01:15:03.446]  As soon as I do, I will definitely put it up on my website.
[01:15:03.766 --> 01:15:12.678]  But all it's going to take is one state to pass that bill, and under the rules, the House of Representatives will have to have impeachment proceedings ahead of all other
[01:15:13.118 --> 01:15:17.761]  Well, I actually have a graph of 9-11, Afghanistan, Iraq, and each time it doesn't go up as high, it's going downwards.
[01:15:42.865 --> 01:15:43.586]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:15:43.626 --> 01:15:46.408]  The effectiveness of a new war is definitely on the wane.
[01:15:46.428 --> 01:15:48.109]  What about a new terror attack?
[01:15:48.850 --> 01:15:52.753]  Well, absolutely, but only if it was something that really convinced people.
[01:15:52.773 --> 01:16:00.138]  And the problem is there are so many people who are suspicious of 9-11 already, and they know the President lied us into a war in Iraq.
[01:16:00.258 --> 01:16:06.663]  And once you come to grips with that, everything the government is saying becomes automatically suspect.
[01:16:07.430 --> 01:16:23.456]  And, uh, you know, everybody, you know, I even, I got my hair cut the other day, and even the girl cutting my hair, who does not know about my website or anything, was going on about Bush is a liar and, and, and, and Bush is going to do something to try and, uh, you know, uh, get his power back.
[01:16:23.476 --> 01:16:24.697]  So they lost credibility?
[01:16:25.117 --> 01:16:26.057]  Yeah, lost credibility.
[01:16:26.077 --> 01:16:32.199]  If you've got hair cutters who are aware of what's going on, then Bush has definitely lost control of the American economy.
[01:16:32.219 --> 01:16:33.600]  Well, it's like the boy who cried wolf.
[01:16:34.728 --> 01:16:40.932]  Absolutely and you know he's cried wolf so many times and every time you know we see it's him inside the wolfskin.
[01:16:45.177 --> 01:16:48.360]  So anyway, I agree, it is a danger.
[01:16:50.282 --> 01:16:53.284]  Obviously he just used the same lies from Iraq on Iran.
[01:16:53.505 --> 01:16:57.148]  What about Bush surrounding himself with more Israelis, dual citizens?
[01:16:57.908 --> 01:17:07.397]  Absolutely, I mean even the Jerusalem Post was kind of crowing about this the other day, about just how thoroughly entrenched Israeli and Jewish power is inside
[01:17:09.370 --> 01:17:12.331]  The problem is they're becoming so arrogant about it.
[01:17:12.371 --> 01:17:13.791]  They're calling attention to it.
[01:17:14.672 --> 01:17:23.934]  And again, this is something else that common people, everyday people who normally don't pay attention to these things, they're picking up on it now and they're starting to talk about it.
[01:17:24.574 --> 01:17:27.535]  And the really ugly thing is there is likely to be a backlash.
[01:17:27.895 --> 01:17:33.136]  And it's of course going to hit all the wrong people who are going to feel it.
[01:17:34.284 --> 01:17:43.390]  But we're clearly headed toward a crisis within the government, and whether it's going to be Bush starting a new terror attack, or possibly a military coup.
[01:17:43.470 --> 01:17:53.116]  I know with all these generals coming forward talking about Rumsfeld being fired, that seems to be a little bit of a signal that the military are definitely fed up with what's going on.
[01:17:53.677 --> 01:17:58.380]  Or even just a popular rebellion that happens as quickly as the one that we saw in Romania.
[01:17:59.280 --> 01:18:01.862]  But it's obvious we cannot stay on the same path much longer.
[01:18:03.152 --> 01:18:04.653]  Why are they so arrogant?
[01:18:04.734 --> 01:18:07.616]  I mean, throughout history we see elites just go crazy.
[01:18:08.737 --> 01:18:10.018]  Yeah, it really is.
[01:18:10.058 --> 01:18:16.664]  They start to fall in love with their own public relations, I think, which is always a recipe for disaster in politics and in entertainment, I might add.
[01:18:17.805 --> 01:18:29.976]  They really start believing their own myth and their own infallibility, and yet history shows that every one of these tyrants always eventually brings themselves or are brought down.
[01:18:31.315 --> 01:18:32.016]  Absolutely.
[01:18:32.076 --> 01:18:34.859]  Michael Rivera will be with us in the middle of the next hour.
[01:18:34.879 --> 01:18:36.320]  We're going to have the phones open later.
[01:18:36.941 --> 01:18:43.908]  There is so much we're going to be discussing, like martial law, bird flu, all of it.
[01:18:44.208 --> 01:18:45.930]  You do not want to miss this information.
[01:18:46.491 --> 01:18:49.434]  We've got two pretty good brains together right now.
[01:18:50.014 --> 01:18:51.396]  We'll bring your comments in as well.
[01:18:53.772 --> 01:19:00.654]  For months now, you've been hearing about the incredible health benefits of Zango, the functional health beverage made from the whole fruit of mangosteen.
[01:19:00.794 --> 01:19:13.718]  What you probably didn't know is that Zango joined forces with the leading manufacturer and distributor of functional health beverages like Capri Sun, Sobe, Mystic, and Red Bull to create the fastest-growing business opportunity in America today.
[01:19:13.898 --> 01:19:15.679]  Are you sick of barely having enough money?
[01:19:15.879 --> 01:19:19.341]  Are you tired of working so hard yet feeling like you'll never get ahead?
[01:19:19.601 --> 01:19:23.383]  Are you ready to start investing in your own business instead of somebody else's?
[01:19:23.643 --> 01:19:28.605]  Whatever it is you seek, Dango could be the special company that helps you achieve your hopes and dreams.
[01:19:28.885 --> 01:19:30.586]  So take matters into your own hands.
[01:19:30.866 --> 01:19:34.828]  Create a future that doesn't depend on a fickle 401k and lateral promotions.

[01:19:43.152 --> 01:19:43.694]  I think so.
[01:19:53.943 --> 01:19:57.846]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt.
[01:19:58.066 --> 01:20:10.354]  But the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999, reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking 10.57% annual increase, outpacing its previous 10 years.
[01:20:10.774 --> 01:20:11.175]  The U.S.
[01:20:11.215 --> 01:20:16.798]  economy receives its currency by taking on debt through a private banking institution called the Federal Reserve System.
[01:20:17.198 --> 01:20:19.400]  In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%.
[01:20:21.261 --> 01:20:22.321]  It's bad enough that the U.S.
[01:20:22.361 --> 01:20:25.202]  citizens is bound by debt in order to have commerce.
[01:20:25.322 --> 01:20:31.343]  However, shocking the economy with a reduction of this magnitude could wipe out years of growth in a stock portfolio.
[01:20:31.764 --> 01:20:35.124]  Before you make your next investment decision, get the cold hard facts.
[01:20:35.204 --> 01:20:41.546]  Call 1-800-686-2237 for your free report on the outstanding level of public and private debt.
[01:20:42.106 --> 01:20:46.135]  You must understand how recession and depression are driven by outstanding debt.
[01:20:46.235 --> 01:20:46.496]  Call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:20:46.516 --> 01:20:46.817]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:20:53.900 --> 01:21:04.631]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials, bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.
[01:21:04.811 --> 01:21:12.379]  The revolutionary Berkey Light, with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements, remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.

[01:21:28.588 --> 01:21:32.490]  The Berkey Light is transparent, so there is no guesswork when refilling the system.
[01:21:32.530 --> 01:21:34.411]  The water level is always visible.
[01:21:34.611 --> 01:21:40.555]  The rechargeable LED lighting system is beautiful as a night light and as necessary in emergency situations.

[01:21:54.625 --> 01:21:55.466]  Come on, Bill.
[01:21:55.666 --> 01:21:57.507]  Two weeks ago, you were riding a bicycle.
[01:21:57.687 --> 01:22:00.849]  And today, you're showing up in your new car and telling me you're buying a house.
[01:22:01.189 --> 01:22:01.749]  What did you do?
[01:22:01.849 --> 01:22:02.670]  Rob Bill Gates?
[01:22:02.770 --> 01:22:03.470]  No, John.
[01:22:03.490 --> 01:22:04.751]  I didn't rob Bill Gates.
[01:22:05.031 --> 01:22:10.554]  What I did do is visit the website www.DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[01:22:10.834 --> 01:22:17.098]  That's where I learn how to make $3,000 to $9,000 each and every week, starting with my very first week.
[01:22:17.438 --> 01:22:19.639]  It's a simple program that does all the work for you.
[01:22:19.939 --> 01:22:20.540]  And get this.
[01:22:20.740 --> 01:22:22.801]  They guarantee my success in writing.
[01:22:23.301 --> 01:22:26.743]  I'm already up to $25,000 just going on my third week!
[01:22:26.983 --> 01:22:27.464]  Whoa!
[01:22:27.784 --> 01:22:29.005]  What was that website again?
[01:22:29.065 --> 01:22:32.547]  It's www.DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[01:22:32.847 --> 01:22:33.967]  Now write this down, John.
[01:22:34.107 --> 01:22:38.410]  You should go there and learn how this program can help you become financially independent, too.
[01:22:38.570 --> 01:22:39.150]  Thanks, Bill.
[01:22:39.411 --> 01:22:40.611]  I'm going there right now.
[01:22:41.032 --> 01:22:41.672]  Check, please!
[01:22:43.452 --> 01:22:44.913]  Uh, you got this one, right, Bill?
[01:22:45.373 --> 01:22:45.993]  Sure, John.
[01:22:46.194 --> 01:22:50.556]  Don't forget, it's www.DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[01:22:50.876 --> 01:22:52.537]  Next time, you'll be buying me lunch.
[01:22:53.937 --> 01:22:59.060]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:22:59.760 --> 01:23:02.101]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:23:02.982 --> 01:23:04.682]  The dollar has been devalued by 44%.
[01:23:04.742 --> 01:23:05.303]  Gold is up at $640+.
[01:23:05.343 --> 01:23:06.763]  Oil, over $70 a barrel.
[01:23:14.167 --> 01:23:23.009]  They're looting the economy and Bush tells us that everything is wonderful and he's going to investigate the oil companies and everything's going to be okay.
[01:23:24.630 --> 01:23:27.930]  Michael Rivero, talking about their delusional nature, what do you see?
[01:23:27.950 --> 01:23:29.871]  I mean, you're a successful person in business in your own right.
[01:23:29.891 --> 01:23:31.311]  What do you see happening with the economy?
[01:23:32.271 --> 01:23:38.193]  Well, I see the economy basically is really hopelessly hooked up in debt.
[01:23:38.613 --> 01:23:42.414]  In fact, you had a very interesting commercial to that very point during this last break.
[01:23:44.496 --> 01:23:53.560]  Despite all the glowing promises, the reality is that the signs are that we're headed for a serious, serious upset for a couple of different reasons.
[01:23:53.620 --> 01:23:56.282]  First of all, there is the matter of government debt itself.
[01:23:57.302 --> 01:24:12.650]  The government is just borrowing so much money, have really gone completely out of control with borrowing to pay for the war in Iraq, borrowing just to sort of keep things propped up, they're borrowing to make the payments on previous loans.
[01:24:13.437 --> 01:24:20.500]  And, uh, the debt is now so great that all of the income tax collected in the entire nation doesn't even meet the interest payments.
[01:24:21.140 --> 01:24:23.642]  So, there's a real problem, uh, there.
[01:24:24.142 --> 01:24:33.266]  Second of all, uh, you have, uh, the Federal Reserve, uh, just stopped publishing what's called the M3 aggregate.
[01:24:33.686 --> 01:24:40.929]  Now, this is a number which basically represents the total estimated supply of money in circulation inside the United States.
[01:24:41.810 --> 01:24:52.484]  And this is really a measure of inflation, because you take your total money supply versus the estimated worth of the entire economy, and that gives you the value of a dollar.
[01:24:53.425 --> 01:24:59.834]  So the only reason that most people can come up with for the M3 aggregate no longer being published is that we're
[01:25:00.476 --> 01:25:14.219]  Preparing to go into a period of hyperinflation where the Federal Reserve is just going to try and inflate the debt away by just printing up more and more currency and just saying, here, here's the money that we owe you.
[01:25:14.239 --> 01:25:15.979]  Let me try to bring that into perspective.
[01:25:17.460 --> 01:25:23.921]  Up until six years ago, the Federal Reserve's inflation curve
[01:25:24.857 --> 01:25:25.378]  I think so.
[01:25:40.752 --> 01:25:41.112]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:25:41.153 --> 01:25:46.156]  It's called a hyperinflationary spiral and it's something that we sadly saw, for example, in Germany just prior to the rise of Hitler.
[01:26:10.077 --> 01:26:25.886]  And what happens is, of course, when you borrow a lot of money and then you just print up more money to pay that back, it looks real good in the short term, but eventually you get into a situation where you have too much money chasing too few goods and services, and that is what drives your prices right through the roof.
[01:26:26.167 --> 01:26:36.753]  We're already starting to see it with the gas prices at the pump and the oil companies saying, boo-hoo, boo-hoo, it's those nasty Arabs forcing us to make billions and billions of dollars in profits.
[01:26:36.813 --> 01:26:38.334]  And that's why it's important to
[01:26:39.435 --> 01:26:40.716]  Look at what's happening with China.
[01:26:40.756 --> 01:26:44.299]  China, up until about six months ago, had pegged its currency to the dollar.
[01:26:44.779 --> 01:26:49.864]  Now they've ominously gone to a basket of other currencies, including the dollar.
[01:26:49.904 --> 01:26:56.209]  So we were still getting these cheap slave goods, you know, these cheap junk goods as the illusion of prosperity.
[01:26:56.469 --> 01:26:57.770]  Now even that's evaporating.
[01:26:58.331 --> 01:26:59.572]  Yeah, that's starting to go down.
[01:26:59.612 --> 01:27:02.034]  We're seeing the price of imports really start to take off.
[01:27:02.554 --> 01:27:06.518]  And one of the critical factors, and this gets back to the coming invasion of Iran,
[01:27:07.433 --> 01:27:12.697]  The much anticipated and talked about oil bourse will finally open its doors next week.
[01:27:12.757 --> 01:27:13.898]  I guess they had some delays.
[01:27:14.659 --> 01:27:17.741]  And this is a real critical issue because one of the ways the U.S.
[01:27:17.761 --> 01:27:26.089]  has propped up its economy is by forcing all other countries to keep huge stores of dollars on hand as an oil currency.
[01:27:26.449 --> 01:27:27.370]  You have to buy oil.
[01:27:27.830 --> 01:27:34.456]  Well, you know, if you have to buy dollars to buy oil, then that increases demand for dollars and that makes them worth more.
[01:27:34.861 --> 01:27:39.663]  But the Iranian oil bourse is going to be trading Iran's oil in Euros.
[01:27:40.323 --> 01:27:46.166]  And so you're going to see nations that are buying oil from Iran will no longer have a need to keep dollars on hand.
[01:27:46.226 --> 01:27:50.907]  And that'll be 8% to start with, a seismic shock to the global economy.
[01:27:51.168 --> 01:27:55.589]  If other countries start to follow suit, as Russia and others say they will, it's going to be devastating.
[01:27:56.150 --> 01:27:58.911]  Yes, it absolutely will, because the U.S.
[01:27:58.951 --> 01:28:00.371]  dollar, it's a fiat currency.
[01:28:00.411 --> 01:28:02.232]  There is really nothing to back it up.
[01:28:03.022 --> 01:28:08.504]  The US, unfortunately, over the last 30 years, has lost most of its manufacturing base.
[01:28:09.224 --> 01:28:17.467]  And even if we went back to a totally internal economy, it's going to take us a while to be able to make a lot of the things that we need to make.
[01:28:19.348 --> 01:28:28.491]  So we're really in a very precarious position, and one of the motives for these wars on Iraq and Iran and Saudi Arabia appears to be to control the oil,
[01:28:30.055 --> 01:28:34.940]  In order to make the dollar continue to be the oil currency for the rest of the world.
[01:28:36.041 --> 01:28:37.623]  Michael Rivero, stay right there.
[01:28:37.663 --> 01:28:38.844]  Please continue on the other side.
[01:28:39.544 --> 01:28:40.605]  Will we have a depression?

[01:28:42.387 --> 01:28:42.808]  Stay with us.

[01:29:13.027 --> 01:29:19.872]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.

[01:32:31.097 --> 01:32:34.420]  One time I even asked him, I think I asked him, hey, I want to steal one of your designs.
[01:32:34.440 --> 01:32:36.222]  I think he said, okay, but I never did it.
[01:32:36.242 --> 01:32:38.965]  I mean, they're that good, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:32:39.905 --> 01:32:41.387]  Before we go back to Michael Rivero,
[01:32:42.757 --> 01:32:44.518]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[01:32:44.578 --> 01:32:52.102]  I mean, real hard to find all-natural pure soap that contains no dyes, perfumes, deodorants, chlorides, glycerins, lanolines, vitamins or antibacterials.
[01:32:52.142 --> 01:32:52.863]  Probably never, right?
[01:32:53.183 --> 01:33:02.668]  Well, the Calvin Soap Company, for the past 59 years, has been making triple-concentrated pure soaps exclusively for healthcare professionals and hospitals.

[01:33:35.797 --> 01:33:36.940]  I'll get that out again in a second.

[01:33:45.142 --> 01:33:46.323]  Yes, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:33:46.743 --> 01:33:49.965]  Call today, Calbin Pure Soap, for a free catalog at 1-800-340-7091.
[01:33:50.125 --> 01:33:52.727]  That's 1-800-340-7091.
[01:33:54.188 --> 01:33:58.411]  Or on the web at CalbinPureSoap.com.
[01:33:58.431 --> 01:34:01.793]  That's spelled C-A-L-B-E-N PureSoap.com.
[01:34:02.133 --> 01:34:05.115]  On the left hand side of InfoWars.com we have a big fat banner.
[01:34:05.635 --> 01:34:05.915]  We're good.
[01:34:14.545 --> 01:34:15.905]  I've been using them for several years.
[01:34:15.925 --> 01:34:17.166]  They've been a sponsor of the network.
[01:34:17.186 --> 01:34:19.206]  So now he's a sponsor of this broadcast itself.
[01:34:19.506 --> 01:34:21.927]  And again, it's factory direct.
[01:34:22.007 --> 01:34:22.807]  It's so good.
[01:34:23.267 --> 01:34:25.748]  Sometimes I would leave soap under my arms or between my legs.
[01:34:25.768 --> 01:34:26.268]  We all do it.
[01:34:26.548 --> 01:34:27.388]  And it burns you.
[01:34:27.828 --> 01:34:30.149]  That's because it's a toxic, chemical-based soap.
[01:34:30.209 --> 01:34:30.709]  Not with this.
[01:34:30.749 --> 01:34:31.769]  And it smells so good.
[01:34:31.809 --> 01:34:37.471]  I mean, the in-office Bastard Hound one time got in a box and ate half a stick of the soap and didn't even get sick.
[01:34:38.711 --> 01:34:42.212]  And again, dogs don't normally try to eat bars of hand soap.
[01:34:43.095 --> 01:34:44.195]  Or face soap.
[01:34:44.275 --> 01:34:46.436]  It just smells so good.
[01:34:46.476 --> 01:34:47.176]  So give them a call.
[01:34:47.936 --> 01:34:55.998]  And then last but not least, Bilderberg Group meeting is coming up soon and Jim Tucker for 27 years, this is the 27th year, has been covering it.
[01:34:56.558 --> 01:35:03.259]  His book, Jim Tucker's Bilderberg Diary, is a must-have put out by American Free Press, full of documents, photos.
[01:35:03.839 --> 01:35:07.700]  The 26 years he's been covering it, by the time they publish this, now it's 27 years.
[01:35:08.420 --> 01:35:11.301]  And if you want to understand the global government and their aims and how much power
[01:35:12.108 --> 01:35:14.330]  This 125-member group has.
[01:35:14.350 --> 01:35:16.252]  You need to get Jim Tucker's Bilderberg Diary.
[01:35:16.592 --> 01:35:18.333]  Available at InfoWars.com.
[01:35:19.474 --> 01:35:24.178]  Then there's my new 9-11 film, Martial Law, 9-1-1, Rise of the Police State.
[01:35:24.198 --> 01:35:29.202]  There's my classic film, the first 9-11 film that came out, and some say still the best, 9-11, The Road to Tyranny.
[01:35:29.242 --> 01:35:31.364]  There's my 9-11 film, The Masters of Terror.
[01:35:32.325 --> 01:35:34.747]  There is Loose Change, 2nd Edition, by Dylan Avery we carry.
[01:35:34.767 --> 01:35:36.929]  I believe it's a lot better than the 1st Edition.
[01:35:36.949 --> 01:35:39.351]  It doesn't have any of the pods or any of that stuff in it.
[01:35:40.084 --> 01:35:42.906]  And there is just so many other books and videos.
[01:35:42.966 --> 01:35:45.987]  Webster Tarpoli's Synthetic Terror, 9-11 Synthetic Terror.
[01:35:46.007 --> 01:35:52.611]  I'm hearing this new video, Secret Mysteries of America's Beginnings, The New Atlantis, which isn't the mythical Atlantis.
[01:35:52.651 --> 01:35:55.912]  It's how the elite said America would be their new world government engine.
[01:35:55.932 --> 01:35:56.913]  This is a very old plan.
[01:35:58.829 --> 01:36:07.757]  We have that available as well, and when you get it for the regular price, you get two of my films for $14.95, The Order of Death and Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove, on one DVD.
[01:36:07.777 --> 01:36:13.142]  So go to the online video and book store at Infowars.com and take advantage of that today.
[01:36:13.162 --> 01:36:14.423]  Or call toll free.
[01:36:14.464 --> 01:36:16.305]  They can take your order and answer all your questions.
[01:36:16.325 --> 01:36:16.385]  1-888-253-3139.
[01:36:22.020 --> 01:36:25.042]  And your purchase of the videos and the books makes this broadcast possible.
[01:36:25.062 --> 01:36:26.223]  I've got ten employees now.
[01:36:26.543 --> 01:36:27.604]  Looking to expand even more.
[01:36:28.064 --> 01:36:29.245]  We run six websites.
[01:36:29.305 --> 01:36:30.245]  We make documentaries.
[01:36:30.285 --> 01:36:31.446]  I do a radio show every day.
[01:36:32.086 --> 01:36:32.967]  I have producers.
[01:36:33.147 --> 01:36:35.849]  And you're making it all possible.
[01:36:37.029 --> 01:36:38.470]  I've done the math my accountant has.
[01:36:38.951 --> 01:36:42.653]  Around 94% of the money that comes in here goes back into the fight.
[01:36:43.343 --> 01:36:47.307]  I keep 6%, ladies and gentlemen, so I can feed my family.
[01:36:47.427 --> 01:36:50.230]  Because I lust after the fight against the New World Order.
[01:36:50.350 --> 01:36:51.111]  I believe in it.
[01:36:51.191 --> 01:36:54.134]  I know that we're not going to have a future if we don't do this.
[01:36:54.215 --> 01:36:57.098]  So help us with some of the hardest working folks in this movement.
[01:36:57.898 --> 01:36:58.759]  I don't take donations.
[01:36:58.779 --> 01:37:00.281]  Sometimes people send them, I don't ask for them.
[01:37:00.848 --> 01:37:05.631]  But if you just go buy the products, the information warfare tools, that's how you support us.
[01:37:05.671 --> 01:37:07.572]  Go get a membership at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:37:07.972 --> 01:37:09.693]  Over a thousand pieces of media up there.
[01:37:09.733 --> 01:37:10.614]  Fifteen cents a day.
[01:37:10.674 --> 01:37:11.094]  Come on!
[01:37:11.554 --> 01:37:14.916]  A Starbucks coffee's a buck fifty for us, for a tall.
[01:37:14.936 --> 01:37:15.977]  One of their small drinks.
[01:37:16.878 --> 01:37:17.158]  Alright.
[01:37:17.578 --> 01:37:19.139]  I'm done ranting about that.
[01:37:19.699 --> 01:37:24.282]  Michael Rivera, before we get back into the news and take some calls, you want to plug your side or plug anything that's on it?
[01:37:25.030 --> 01:37:39.916]  Well, just to have people come over and visit WhatReallyHappened.com, and I do of course link from my site to both of yours, InfoWars and Prison Planet, on a regular basis, and that's really all I have to plug today.
[01:37:41.619 --> 01:37:47.183]  All right, my friend, what are some of the issues that are near and dear to your heart that you think are important that you want to cover after we take some calls?
[01:37:47.823 --> 01:38:05.194]  Well, I want to get back into this issue of yet more evidence surfacing that Bush intentionally, and I stress the word intentionally, lied to the people of the United States of America and lied to the Congress in order to get his war in Iraq.
[01:38:06.852 --> 01:38:22.702]  And, you know, we can disagree on some of the fine points on a lot of the issues such as 9-11, but I think rather than get caught up in these little differences, we just have to really say, okay, we know we got lied to and the fine details don't matter.
[01:38:23.062 --> 01:38:26.344]  We need to accept this and think about its ramifications.
[01:38:27.005 --> 01:38:35.030]  And one that I like to point out to people, you know, especially when they start talking about the higher taxes and all the government borrowing to pay for the war,
[01:38:35.789 --> 01:38:41.650]  And that is to say, you know, are we really liable for the cost of the war if it is an illegal war?
[01:38:42.111 --> 01:38:50.292]  Because when Congress voted the authorization for the use of force in Iraq, they included two requirements in it.
[01:38:50.733 --> 01:38:57.254]  First, the President had to prove that Iraq was in defiance of the United Nations by being in possession of banned weapons of mass destruction.
[01:38:57.794 --> 01:39:00.375]  And second, that Iraq had something to do with 9-11.
[01:39:01.471 --> 01:39:13.915]  Now, in his letter of transmittal to Congress of, I think it was March 18th, 2003, President Bush implied he had proof of both conditions, and said, therefore, we can proceed.
[01:39:14.395 --> 01:39:29.160]  Now, in hindsight, of course, we know that Bush could not have had proof of those two assertions, because we know now that Iraq did not have any weapons of mass destruction, and... And we know with the White House and Downing Street memos that they premeditatedly lied.
[01:39:30.030 --> 01:39:33.472]  Absolutely, and we know that Iraq had nothing to do with 9-11.
[01:39:33.912 --> 01:39:41.957]  So that congressional authorization for the use of force in Iraq was never legally in effect, because it was entered into fraudulently.
[01:39:42.518 --> 01:39:48.001]  That means Bush is using government property, our military, for a private little war.
[01:39:48.321 --> 01:39:55.025]  Now anytime a senator or congressman gets caught using government property for their own personal use, they're required to reimburse the Treasury.
[01:39:55.447 --> 01:40:05.032]  So the way I see it, and the way I think all Americans should see it, is that President Bush and his neocons owe the United States Treasury several billion dollars for the cost of this war.
[01:40:05.492 --> 01:40:19.599]  Now, of course, for all the deaths that have resulted from this war under false pretenses, I think there are some civil remedies, but I think we the people are not obligated to pay these bills because the war was entered into fraudulently.
[01:40:20.039 --> 01:40:23.360]  Let's take a few calls and we'll get back into that in the next hour in more detail.
[01:40:23.400 --> 01:40:24.421]  It's very, very important.
[01:40:25.060 --> 01:40:27.241]  Let's talk to Israel in New Jersey.
[01:40:27.341 --> 01:40:28.201]  Israel, go ahead.
[01:40:28.442 --> 01:40:29.702]  Yes, how are you doing, Alex?
[01:40:29.982 --> 01:40:30.202]  Good.
[01:40:30.643 --> 01:40:36.465]  I'm a member of the Perkins Planet TV and also I do advocate here in the Atlantic City area.
[01:40:37.125 --> 01:40:47.010]  I just want to ask, there was a committee of people that got together for the 9-11 committee to help out all the people that were having problems because of the commission.
[01:40:47.370 --> 01:40:48.831]  Now, Alex, I just want your take on this.
[01:40:49.051 --> 01:40:53.793]  They were talking about doing it internationally and getting Nelson Mandela,
[01:40:54.420 --> 01:41:10.925]  To be like one of the chief sponsors and I have a problem with that because I know firsthand that he is a Phi Beta Sigma and his symbol is the Diablo which he was teaching and he's also one of the Rothschild's men, so one of their masons.
[01:41:11.325 --> 01:41:13.606]  So I just want to know, I'd like to have your take on it.
[01:41:14.770 --> 01:41:27.477]  Well, part of the message of my website has been all along is that Americans should stop relying on other committees and other media and other people to tell them what to think and look at the facts and decide for themselves.
[01:41:27.898 --> 01:41:35.642]  So I think the proper course of action is to stop calling for more committees and more whatever and say, oh yes, we can let this panel investigate it for us.
[01:41:36.135 --> 01:41:37.556]  Investigate it yourself.
[01:41:37.916 --> 01:41:39.117]  You want to know who you should trust?
[01:41:39.157 --> 01:41:44.041]  You should trust your own brain and your own mind and your own analytical... Well, I'll say this.
[01:41:44.061 --> 01:41:47.023]  Mandela was in jail for decades and decades, that release team.
[01:41:47.484 --> 01:41:48.685]  He's always been a stooge.
[01:41:48.705 --> 01:41:50.466]  The left tries to make him some darling.
[01:41:50.946 --> 01:41:53.809]  Winnie likes to run around burning kids' heads off, admittedly.
[01:41:53.829 --> 01:41:58.252]  I mean, Nelson Mandela isn't going to save us, and so that's my comment there.
[01:41:59.847 --> 01:42:00.507]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:42:00.547 --> 01:42:03.768]  Go to the websites like Prison Planet and Infowars and What Really Happened.
[01:42:03.828 --> 01:42:06.269]  Get the facts and figure it out for yourself.
[01:42:06.409 --> 01:42:07.529]  And wake other people up.
[01:42:07.569 --> 01:42:10.010]  You know you're good, so you go out and be a leader.
[01:42:10.350 --> 01:42:11.610]  Well, I have done that, Alex.
[01:42:11.650 --> 01:42:13.031]  I do that in Atlantic City.
[01:42:13.071 --> 01:42:14.931]  I tell everyone about you.
[01:42:14.951 --> 01:42:16.612]  I tell them about everything that you teach.
[01:42:16.672 --> 01:42:18.152]  And like I said, I'm the guy I called before.
[01:42:18.172 --> 01:42:19.593]  Because I used to be in the Lodge.
[01:42:19.633 --> 01:42:20.593]  I was a Scottish White Mason.
[01:42:20.633 --> 01:42:21.373]  I called you before.
[01:42:21.973 --> 01:42:23.654]  And I repented and I'm a born-again minister.
[01:42:24.298 --> 01:42:25.679]  And I just want one more thing, Alex.
[01:42:25.780 --> 01:42:31.966]  Is it possible, maybe off the air, that you can give Tex Mars my number because he's my brother in the Lord?
[01:42:31.986 --> 01:42:33.887]  Because I need to ask him a question about it.
[01:42:33.907 --> 01:42:36.090]  Well, sir, you can call his office and leave your number there.
[01:42:36.550 --> 01:42:37.091]  Oh, okay.
[01:42:37.131 --> 01:42:37.991]  How do I get that number?
[01:42:38.011 --> 01:42:39.453]  Do you have a computer?
[01:42:39.513 --> 01:42:39.873]  Yes, I do.
[01:42:39.893 --> 01:42:44.017]  You can go to TexMars.com, PowerOfProphecy.com, and the phone number will be right there.
[01:42:44.037 --> 01:42:45.399]  Okay, thank you so much, Alex.
[01:42:45.479 --> 01:42:45.819]  Thank you.
[01:42:48.351 --> 01:42:52.492]  Do it for yourself, you can pop it into Google, get the website, get the number, call him.
[01:42:53.312 --> 01:42:55.692]  Let's talk to, who's up next here?
[01:42:57.113 --> 01:42:58.753]  Andrea in Ohio, go ahead.
[01:42:58.933 --> 01:43:02.294]  Yes, love your website, love the email group.
[01:43:02.494 --> 01:43:03.534]  I'm on that a lot.
[01:43:04.854 --> 01:43:08.555]  I had a question to shift gears to bird flu for just a moment.
[01:43:09.455 --> 01:43:15.656]  I noticed over the last couple of months that there have been a spate of bird flu films coming out.
[01:43:16.561 --> 01:43:22.025]  Like this Hades factor, and now there's this new thing on ABC, May 9th.
[01:43:24.212 --> 01:43:31.018]  And I'm wondering, do you think the government is behind a propaganda thing, producing all those things?
[01:43:31.038 --> 01:43:31.879]  Well, let me comment on that.
[01:43:32.019 --> 01:43:35.982]  Michael Rivera has actually worked in Hollywood, so he can comment on it as well.
[01:43:36.002 --> 01:43:36.823]  He's written a lot about it.
[01:43:37.263 --> 01:43:46.791]  Have you noticed that on 24, Threat Matrix, CSI Miami, on all these shows they torture someone every episode, they torture someone's child, it's good.
[01:43:47.332 --> 01:43:49.734]  Evil's good, they plant WMDs, it's good.
[01:43:50.414 --> 01:43:54.076]  And then it simultaneously mirrors the Bush administration's propaganda.
[01:43:54.136 --> 01:44:06.922]  Bush admittedly, and the Congressional Budget Office and the GAO, Governmental Accounting Office, both said it was illegal, spent $1.6 billion for fake newscasts and paying off reporters, thousands of reporters.
[01:44:07.362 --> 01:44:15.866]  And I have AP articles that back after 9-11, they pay $44 million a year to several script writing houses in LA who quote, write terror scripts.
[01:44:16.287 --> 01:44:18.708]  We know they then even use those as war plans.
[01:44:19.514 --> 01:44:24.196]  They do this over and over and over again, and it's all part of this backdrop of fear.
[01:44:24.576 --> 01:44:26.116]  We're going to be hit by terrorists.
[01:44:26.476 --> 01:44:27.537]  Give up all your rights.
[01:44:27.577 --> 01:44:30.318]  The government's going to be your savior when the terrorists hit you.
[01:44:31.078 --> 01:44:33.959]  They're drilling us like a re-education camp.
[01:44:34.019 --> 01:44:40.061]  America itself is a giant brainwashing camp with Edward Bernays-type psychology to accept all of this.
[01:44:40.121 --> 01:44:40.701]  Michael Rivera?
[01:44:41.454 --> 01:44:49.559]  Yeah, there is a long, long history of the government covertly intervening in Hollywood to control the content of some movies.
[01:44:49.599 --> 01:44:58.404]  Now, the control is not total, and I'll get into that in just a few minutes, but this relationship, if you'll call it, goes all the way back almost to the days of silent films.
[01:44:59.280 --> 01:45:16.575]  Most people are not aware of this, but the main reason that Charlie Chaplin lost his citizenship and had to leave the United States was that J. Edgar Hoover had asked him to please retailer his films so that they did not show authority figures as humorous characters, and Chaplin refused.
[01:45:16.655 --> 01:45:23.080]  And from that point on, Hoover said, well, I'm going to get rid of this guy, because we need movies that teach Americans to respect authority.
[01:45:23.884 --> 01:45:33.507]  And, you know, there was the whole COINTELPRO thing in the 60s where people like actress Jean Seberg, her career was completely destroyed by the FBI.
[01:45:33.727 --> 01:45:49.012]  By the way, Hoover would go to TV shows and everybody and threaten them, you're only going to show the FBI in a good light, even help write the scripts, a total control freak, and so we see this over and over again.
[01:45:49.739 --> 01:46:01.206]  Yeah, if you look back at the James Stewart movie, The FBI Story, there's a director listed on the film, but Hoover himself was actually on the set directing the movie and saying, this is how they will behave and this is what they'll say.
[01:46:01.727 --> 01:46:04.689]  And he's shown briefly from the back side as a cameo.
[01:46:05.549 --> 01:46:07.610]  But yeah, he was totally in control of that film.
[01:46:08.111 --> 01:46:12.994]  There's a short blurb about more of this stuff at my website, and I'll put a link to that up after the show.
[01:46:13.576 --> 01:46:18.639]  But today we are seeing, you know, there's a lot of control inside Hollywood.
[01:46:18.659 --> 01:46:21.520]  We're seeing, you know, Charlie Sheen, of course, spoke out about 9-11.
[01:46:21.940 --> 01:46:25.482]  And now, of course, this week we're seeing the smear machine really cranked up on him.
[01:46:25.502 --> 01:46:31.985]  By the way, Michael, I just want to let you know, because I have the inside knowledge, it is all pure, total baloney.
[01:46:32.385 --> 01:46:34.767]  And he was told, shut up about 9-11 or else.
[01:46:34.787 --> 01:46:35.487]  That's all I can say.
[01:46:36.007 --> 01:46:36.307]  Okay.
[01:46:36.668 --> 01:46:40.369]  But I want to call attention to another show called Boston Legal.
[01:46:40.409 --> 01:46:40.950]  It's on ABC.
[01:46:42.200 --> 01:46:50.442]  And they certainly are not under government control because they have an episode called Stick It, and it's still online.
[01:46:50.462 --> 01:46:53.923]  The closing argument segment, if you go to the official show's website... By the way, we have that.
[01:46:53.983 --> 01:46:56.404]  Guys, get that Boston Legal ready for the next hour.
[01:46:56.484 --> 01:46:58.164]  Scott, do you know what I'm talking about?
[01:46:58.984 --> 01:47:00.725]  Is that the one where they had the...
[01:47:01.638 --> 01:47:06.924]  The woman who, they wouldn't pay the taxes, and yeah, oh I love that, I've got the transcript, yes.
[01:47:07.385 --> 01:47:18.017]  Yeah, and yeah, if we can play that recording, because that was an absolutely wonderful speech, and you know, everyone, it was all over the internet, and everyone saying, this is what TV should be putting out there, because this is what we're all about.
[01:47:18.177 --> 01:47:24.501]  What happens is, and I know a lot of producers, I know a lot of actors, they're able to slip a few things out, then the hammer gets dropped on them.
[01:47:24.761 --> 01:47:27.262]  So when you do see something good, it's people rebelling.
[01:47:27.282 --> 01:47:32.525]  And believe me, behind the scenes, I'd say the Hollywood crowd is actually the most informed about the New World Order.
[01:47:32.825 --> 01:47:34.926]  They understand the false left-right paradigm.
[01:47:34.946 --> 01:47:37.748]  Almost everybody I talk to, they know they're under control.
[01:47:38.068 --> 01:47:43.351]  They quote, hate the old fossils that run their divisions.
[01:47:43.972 --> 01:47:45.392]  I mean, Mike, you've worked in Hollywood.
[01:47:45.412 --> 01:47:46.273]  Is that the same thing you're getting?
[01:47:47.153 --> 01:47:47.733]  Yeah, it is.
[01:47:48.073 --> 01:47:51.434]  And of course, I'm not in Hollywood itself anymore.
[01:47:51.775 --> 01:47:56.636]  I actually got driven out, you know, back when I started the website about Vincent Foster.
[01:47:56.656 --> 01:47:59.397]  It kind of brought my career to an abrupt end inside Hollywood.
[01:47:59.717 --> 01:48:04.338]  But fortunately, filmmaking is now a global endeavor, so there are lots of other places I work.
[01:48:06.499 --> 01:48:06.939]  Thank you.
[01:48:07.019 --> 01:48:10.920]  Thank you for answering my question and for all the work you do with the website.
[01:48:10.960 --> 01:48:11.560]  You bet, Andrea.
[01:48:11.580 --> 01:48:11.900]  Thanks.
[01:48:12.561 --> 01:48:13.581]  Sean in New Hampshire.
[01:48:13.601 --> 01:48:14.001]  Go ahead.
[01:48:16.513 --> 01:48:16.853]  Hello.
[01:48:17.033 --> 01:48:17.333]  Yes, sir.
[01:48:18.134 --> 01:48:18.474]  Hi there.
[01:48:19.194 --> 01:48:20.955]  Thanks for having me on the show.
[01:48:22.095 --> 01:48:28.418]  I've been distributing your videos and things, and I do encourage people to go out and look at the facts for 9-11.
[01:48:28.458 --> 01:48:33.220]  I'm an engineer, and that's how it convinced me that this whole thing is a government scam.
[01:48:33.641 --> 01:48:36.942]  If you look at the facts, you do the math, it's not difficult.
[01:48:37.702 --> 01:48:43.825]  And once you realize the truth, you can't pull the curtain back over the wizard behind the green curtain.
[01:48:46.696 --> 01:48:52.119]  And, people, we have to wake up to this and get the information out, because we're being taken over.
[01:48:52.139 --> 01:48:56.702]  Yeah, we have people running the government that are murderers and carried out 9-11.
[01:48:56.722 --> 01:48:57.402]  Michael Rivero?
[01:48:58.003 --> 01:48:59.083]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:48:59.604 --> 01:49:01.785]  There are so many things wrong with the 9-11 story.
[01:49:01.825 --> 01:49:08.949]  And you know, the funny thing is, the day that it actually happened, and I was talking to my friend, and even then, people were saying, there's something funny about this.
[01:49:09.149 --> 01:49:12.331]  You know, I'm not buying this official Arab story.
[01:49:12.431 --> 01:49:13.492]  It's just too convenient.
[01:49:13.792 --> 01:49:18.354]  And then, of course, it came out immediately thereafter that the U.S.
[01:49:18.394 --> 01:49:22.096]  government had been planning a war in Afghanistan in October.
[01:49:22.176 --> 01:49:23.457]  Already had the troops massed.
[01:49:23.857 --> 01:49:25.018]  Already had the troops massed.
[01:49:25.058 --> 01:49:31.381]  Had already told other governments as early as March of 2001 that they would be invading Afghanistan in October.
[01:49:31.461 --> 01:49:33.062]  Stay there, Sean.
[01:49:33.102 --> 01:49:34.022]  I want to give you some more time.
[01:49:34.042 --> 01:49:35.283]  You didn't get much time to finish up.
[01:49:35.323 --> 01:49:36.563]  As an engineer, I want to get your take.
[01:49:39.048 --> 01:49:43.777]  You know, even the head of the John Birch Society, on with this last hour, had to say, yeah, Building 7, very suspicious.
[01:49:43.817 --> 01:49:46.683]  So, you know, even those guys are going to be forced to come out.
[01:49:47.404 --> 01:49:49.788]  We'll be right back with Michael Rivero, continuing in the next hour.
[01:49:49.828 --> 01:49:50.670]  This is a great interview.
[01:49:50.690 --> 01:49:51.532]  We thank him for joining us.
[01:49:53.504 --> 01:50:00.366]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[01:50:00.666 --> 01:50:02.027]  That's right folks, DVD.
[01:50:02.227 --> 01:50:04.427]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[01:50:04.587 --> 01:50:06.668]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[01:50:06.948 --> 01:50:11.890]  If you want to wake up your friends and families to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[01:50:12.230 --> 01:50:16.251]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[01:50:16.511 --> 01:50:18.272]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[01:50:18.352 --> 01:50:29.020]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plannable microchips, and much, much more.
[01:50:29.160 --> 01:50:31.061]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[01:50:31.241 --> 01:50:35.124]  Order your copy on VHS or DVD today, and man the guns in the info war.
[01:50:35.224 --> 01:50:36.645]  Order right now by calling 1-888-253-3139.
[01:50:36.685 --> 01:50:36.885]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:50:43.650 --> 01:50:47.297]  Or order online at Infowars.com or Infowars.net.
[01:50:47.578 --> 01:50:48.359]  Again, that number, 888-253-3139.
[01:50:52.845 --> 01:50:55.846]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[01:50:56.166 --> 01:51:01.088]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[01:51:01.348 --> 01:51:05.709]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[01:51:05.989 --> 01:51:14.912]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[01:51:15.112 --> 01:51:18.753]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[01:51:19.033 --> 01:51:24.061]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[01:51:24.361 --> 01:51:31.092]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[01:51:31.593 --> 01:51:32.133]  What about you?
[01:51:32.868 --> 01:51:38.232]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.
[01:51:38.272 --> 01:51:39.293]  Call now to order at 1-888-803-4438.
[01:51:39.453 --> 01:51:41.334]  Order today and save $14 by calling 1-888-803-4438.
[01:51:54.232 --> 01:51:54.672]  Thank you.
[01:52:09.537 --> 01:52:10.177]  We're good to go!
[01:52:39.053 --> 01:52:42.134]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[01:52:42.294 --> 01:52:48.256]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[01:52:56.098 --> 01:53:02.140]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:53:02.740 --> 01:53:05.701]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:10.296 --> 01:53:12.438]  We're rip-roaring and they'll send me the audio.
[01:53:12.478 --> 01:53:13.478]  I'll be doing good!
[01:53:16.781 --> 01:53:20.964]  We're back live here with Michael Rivero and we're talking to Sean in New Hampshire.
[01:53:20.984 --> 01:53:22.505]  We did find that Boston Legal clip.
[01:53:23.005 --> 01:53:26.368]  It'll be coming up at the 8 after break in the second segment of the next hour.
[01:53:26.388 --> 01:53:29.270]  Rivero's still riding shotgun with us then, graciously.
[01:53:29.991 --> 01:53:31.912]  Go ahead and finish up what you were saying, Sean.
[01:53:32.592 --> 01:53:38.617]  Yes, I was talking about as a perspective from an engineer's point of view when I saw the video.
[01:53:39.418 --> 01:53:49.045]  And of the 9-11 collapse and the explanations that were coming out, you know, things just smelled wrong.
[01:53:49.065 --> 01:53:51.527]  And first of all, jet fuel can't melt steel.
[01:53:51.547 --> 01:53:52.908]  Okay?
[01:53:52.988 --> 01:53:53.848]  It's impossible.
[01:53:54.249 --> 01:53:59.152]  That's like saying, you know, if you throw a ball up in the air, it's gonna go keep on going.
[01:53:59.953 --> 01:54:01.454]  That's like saying gravity doesn't work.
[01:54:02.054 --> 01:54:04.976]  Secondly, the buildings, how fast they came down.
[01:54:05.176 --> 01:54:07.098]  They came down in free fall.
[01:54:07.498 --> 01:54:08.779]  At the speed of a bowling ball.
[01:54:09.647 --> 01:54:17.917]  Exactly, and as the speed of a bowling ball being dropped from the top of the building and a building designed to hold up millions of kilotons
[01:54:18.892 --> 01:54:25.857]  of steel and building and cement is going to provide resistance and it's going to slow down the fall.
[01:54:26.277 --> 01:54:28.118]  And that did not happen in these buildings.
[01:54:28.458 --> 01:54:34.983]  Well, one's never fallen from fire, and we can give Michael Rivero's take on that, but people say, well, there aren't engineers going public.
[01:54:35.623 --> 01:54:41.387]  Kevin Ryan, who did the underwriting for Underwriter Laboratories, is now giving public speeches, been public for two years.
[01:54:41.707 --> 01:54:43.868]  They fired him when he released their internal documents.
[01:54:43.928 --> 01:54:44.769]  They did test
[01:54:45.309 --> 01:54:53.215]  Bathing it in steel, injecting oxygen in hot fires, I mean, it's just simple math, it's simple science.
[01:54:53.275 --> 01:54:56.778]  Michael Rivero, you have to tell this, and great to tell yourself.
[01:54:57.238 --> 01:55:01.662]  Yeah, well, essentially my fellow Granite Stater here is absolutely correct.
[01:55:02.562 --> 01:55:07.206]  Jet kerosene is not going to burn hot enough to melt steel, or even to soften it.
[01:55:07.927 --> 01:55:10.889]  And of course, the real giveaway is building number seven.
[01:55:11.385 --> 01:55:14.808]  Which collapsed directly into its own footprint straight down.
[01:55:14.888 --> 01:55:16.209]  From two tiny fires.
[01:55:16.709 --> 01:55:17.710]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:55:17.730 --> 01:55:18.531]  Two tiny fires.
[01:55:19.131 --> 01:55:27.378]  And first of all, for a building to collapse like that, all the load-bearing members must be cut at exactly the same moment for it to hit the one side.
[01:55:27.478 --> 01:55:32.122]  It's precisely, they implode the main central column, so it falls in on its own footprint.
[01:55:32.142 --> 01:55:32.883]  Beautiful job!
[01:55:33.670 --> 01:55:34.290]  Absolutely.
[01:55:34.390 --> 01:55:45.714]  Now, at this point in time, with the exception of the World Trade Towers, with the exception of World Trade Tower 7, no steel-framed building has collapsed from a fire.
[01:55:45.834 --> 01:55:52.957]  And, of course, the exemplar that is held up most often is the first interstate fire, a bank fire, in Los Angeles.
[01:55:53.237 --> 01:55:57.000]  This was a steel frame building that burned right down to the frame.
[01:55:57.140 --> 01:55:59.401]  But the steel frame remained standing.
[01:55:59.901 --> 01:56:02.963]  So, you know, we're really at a loss to explain... What about Madrid?
[01:56:03.024 --> 01:56:04.364]  They had the windows off of it.
[01:56:04.384 --> 01:56:06.946]  It was a perfect flute to bring in air.
[01:56:07.286 --> 01:56:10.428]  White hot, 100 plus foot flames for almost two days.
[01:56:10.789 --> 01:56:13.190]  And then little steel desk didn't even melt.
[01:56:13.510 --> 01:56:14.391]  Nothing collapsed.
[01:56:14.731 --> 01:56:16.853]  Yeah, absolutely was the case.
[01:56:16.913 --> 01:56:20.295]  I mean, if kerosene could melt metal, then anybody who'd ever had a kerosene lantern
[01:56:20.771 --> 01:56:27.637]  You know, I was going to see it explode, but kerosene is chosen because... Well, you just throw a kerosene lantern on an army tank and it would melt!
[01:56:28.137 --> 01:56:29.138]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:56:29.578 --> 01:56:36.544]  So, you know, and there are more and more indications that something was used to assist the failure of the load-bearing members.
[01:56:37.445 --> 01:56:46.853]  And the most often suggested assistant is thermite, which is a material which leaves relatively few identifiable traces.
[01:56:46.913 --> 01:56:49.135]  All it leaves is slags of melted iron.
[01:56:49.195 --> 01:56:55.299]  And now there's a video, let me ask the engineer this, there's a video of this hot metal gushing and pouring out.
[01:56:57.801 --> 01:57:02.325]  An explanation has been offered that that's aluminum or something, and that's incorrect.
[01:57:02.405 --> 01:57:03.586]  Aluminum wouldn't melt it.
[01:57:04.065 --> 01:57:06.886]  We'll be back with Michael Rivero in 70 seconds.
[01:57:33.248 --> 01:57:38.090]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNlive.com or call toll free 877-300-7645.
[01:57:38.130 --> 01:57:38.570]  Big Brother.
[01:57:38.730 --> 01:57:39.531]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:39.731 --> 01:57:45.453]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:45.854 --> 01:57:48.415]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.400 --> 01:57:57.281]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.301 --> 01:58:01.585]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.125 --> 01:58:06.229]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:08.350 --> 01:58:19.100]  Michael Rivero, who has been on the web since the mid-1990s or even earlier, exposing Vince Foster's suicide, and we're being on the radio.
[01:58:20.547 --> 01:58:23.209]  1995-96, covering the information he brought forward.
[01:58:23.769 --> 01:58:26.331]  A real pioneer joins us.
[01:58:26.371 --> 01:58:29.352]  He's been exposing 9-11, the Iraq War, the Iran situation.
[01:58:29.372 --> 01:58:31.334]  We're going to get into more detail on that coming up.
[01:58:31.354 --> 01:58:35.756]  We're going to play that Boston Legal clip that he mentioned of what TV should be coming up.
[01:58:35.796 --> 01:58:41.019]  And we'll continue with your phone calls, Stuart and Alex and Eddie and Tim and others.
[01:58:41.059 --> 01:58:46.942]  But right now, one of my fellow broadcasters, Jack Blood, wanted to call in with a question or a comment with Michael Rivero.
[01:58:47.022 --> 01:58:47.803]  Jack, you're on the air.
[01:58:48.363 --> 01:58:50.246]  Hey, thanks Alex for taking my call.
[01:58:50.546 --> 01:58:52.769]  I'm a big fan of both you guys, as you know.
[01:58:53.110 --> 01:58:57.155]  You know, I just heard you talking about 24, and I don't know if you guys have been following it or watching it.
[01:58:57.215 --> 01:58:57.676]  I do.
[01:58:58.177 --> 01:59:01.862]  I'm starting to think, and I'd like to get Mike's impression of this, I'm starting to think that
[01:59:02.358 --> 01:59:06.060]  They have covertly been trying to warn us with this program.
[01:59:06.100 --> 01:59:16.986]  As you see now, the program has evolved into the President being the terrorist, and now in the last episode, he is working with a shadowy group of bankers who are telling him what to do.
[01:59:17.386 --> 01:59:23.730]  Is it possible that all along, 24 and Keeper Southerland, who I know personally is rather liberal, is it possible that
[01:59:24.270 --> 01:59:28.072]  All along, they have been trying to use the program to shock us and warn us.
[01:59:28.132 --> 01:59:30.794]  I know it sounds absurd, but I'm starting to get this impression.
[01:59:30.934 --> 01:59:33.615]  Well, let me comment on it and then get Mike Rivera's comment.
[01:59:34.195 --> 01:59:36.957]  Jack, I've studied psychological warfare, as I know you have.
[01:59:37.397 --> 01:59:40.399]  I've studied Edward Bernays, the father of modern PR and advertising.
[01:59:41.199 --> 01:59:43.860]  And I know Hollywood is full of good people that do know the truth.
[01:59:43.880 --> 01:59:45.321]  They're not liberals like you hear, folks.
[01:59:45.361 --> 01:59:46.622]  They got their head screwed on straight.
[01:59:47.082 --> 01:59:48.443]  They're populist.
[01:59:48.483 --> 01:59:49.623]  They're anti-New World Order.
[01:59:49.764 --> 01:59:50.804]  Everybody I meet.
[01:59:50.884 --> 01:59:51.384]  It's everybody.
[01:59:51.584 --> 01:59:52.325]  It's ridiculous.
[01:59:53.206 --> 01:59:54.449]  Uh, names I can't mention here.
[01:59:54.469 --> 01:59:59.879]  Uh, but I mean, and it's no secret that Mel Gibson knows all about the New World Order, so I can say that.
[02:00:00.600 --> 02:00:03.626]  Uh, but that's just, you know, one of the people out there who we know knows about it.
[02:00:04.426 --> 02:00:05.407]  Somebody's a little more public.
[02:00:06.548 --> 02:00:07.709]  I don't know about Keeper Southerland.
[02:00:07.749 --> 02:00:09.110]  I've only seen some of the episodes.
[02:00:09.150 --> 02:00:14.654]  I read the synopsis of the show, you know, where the government's going to set off a nuke, they control Al-Qaeda.
[02:00:15.195 --> 02:00:28.285]  I know that's going on, but there's also revelation of the method where the psychological warfare chiefs say that if they put something out first as entertainment, somehow it makes it more acceptable when it actually happens.
[02:00:28.345 --> 02:00:29.006]  Michael Rivero?
[02:00:29.935 --> 02:00:34.838]  Yeah, that's one aspect of it, and I want to share a little bit of insight about TV shows.
[02:00:35.538 --> 02:00:41.461]  The actors that you see on the show really have very little to say about the content of the show.
[02:00:41.501 --> 02:00:42.261]  They read the script.
[02:00:42.462 --> 02:00:43.242]  They're given the script.
[02:00:43.722 --> 02:00:48.665]  Yeah, it's the script writers and the executive producers who really call the shots on it.
[02:00:48.685 --> 02:00:58.390]  So when a show does something really good, you know, we talk about James Spader in the Boston Legal Show, but it was really the writers and the executive producers of the show who said, it is time to make this statement.
[02:00:59.009 --> 02:01:07.492]  And as far as 24, yes, I have noticed that they're definitely starting to go the route of, you know, the government is really behind a lot of what's going on.
[02:01:07.972 --> 02:01:21.738]  I think a lot of that may be that this idea is so popular and now dominant in major polls in some cases, 80 plus percent in scientific polls, 60 something percent, 68 percent, 66 percent, excuse me, 66 percent in the last Zogby.
[02:01:21.838 --> 02:01:25.199]  So they're being forced to maintain their relevance.
[02:01:25.239 --> 02:01:25.459]  Michael?
[02:01:26.156 --> 02:01:29.441]  Yeah, they're following the crowd rather than leading it.
[02:01:29.621 --> 02:01:38.833]  I'd like to add something here though too is because there is an effect and what you said earlier Alex about them telling us what they're doing and kind of giving us the heads up as they're doing this stuff in our face.
[02:01:39.429 --> 02:01:48.913]  It's very true, but also what effect does it have for the American people to see that the president is behind all the terrorism and working for a group of shadowy bankers?
[02:01:49.494 --> 02:01:52.515]  I think that that is something very, very interesting.
[02:01:52.635 --> 02:01:56.757]  Alex, if you'd allow me a quick shameless plug for my program that follows yours today.
[02:01:57.137 --> 02:02:09.670]  I have Professor Bruce Lawrence from Duke University who has written a very extensive book that proves, as Mike has been saying all along, that Osama Bin Laden has been dead and that all of these tapes are faked, and I hope people will join us on that program today.
[02:02:10.491 --> 02:02:13.454]  Yeah, that's great, Jack, and fire that number over after you're done with this guy.
[02:02:14.375 --> 02:02:14.755]  You got it.
[02:02:14.775 --> 02:02:15.416]  Okay, thank you.
[02:02:15.436 --> 02:02:18.099]  Keep up the good work, and much love and respect to both of you.
[02:02:18.359 --> 02:02:19.200]  Well, thank you, Jack.
[02:02:20.470 --> 02:02:26.132]  Michael Rivero, you can sit back for three minutes and then have a couple more minutes to go take a break if you want.
[02:02:26.152 --> 02:02:32.174]  If not, you can sit here with us and listen as we play the Boston legal piece that you mentioned earlier.
[02:02:32.914 --> 02:02:35.155]  And then we'll come right back to you and continue with the calls.
[02:02:35.295 --> 02:02:39.737]  And then we'll get more into the Iran situation and Bush lying about WMDs.
[02:02:39.757 --> 02:02:40.537]  Does that sound good?
[02:02:40.557 --> 02:02:41.678]  That sounds great.
[02:02:41.918 --> 02:02:42.678]  We'll be right back.
[02:02:46.764 --> 02:02:49.606]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[02:02:49.846 --> 02:02:51.427]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[02:02:51.787 --> 02:02:56.450]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[02:02:56.791 --> 02:03:03.535]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[02:03:03.875 --> 02:03:05.836]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[02:03:06.036 --> 02:03:08.877]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[02:03:08.977 --> 02:03:13.638]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[02:03:13.858 --> 02:03:18.260]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[02:03:18.480 --> 02:03:25.722]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that is sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[02:03:25.963 --> 02:03:28.383]  Discover the documentary for yourself before it's too late.

[02:03:45.911 --> 02:03:47.492]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[02:03:47.872 --> 02:03:53.615]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.

[02:03:59.338 --> 02:04:08.603]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, trihalomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.
[02:04:08.963 --> 02:04:13.945]  It's rechargeable 8-lamp bright white LED lighting system provides the ideal source of emergency light.
[02:04:14.246 --> 02:04:18.248]  The lights can run all night on a single charge and it is bright enough to read by.
[02:04:18.448 --> 02:04:23.210]  This provides a relaxing and ambient night light that allows for optimum use during emergency conditions.

[02:05:45.385 --> 02:05:53.070]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show, because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:05:53.090 --> 02:06:08.138]  Yeah, a few months ago, when Boston Legal, which usually has the CPS grabbing people's children because they're evil and guns are evil, they did change Horses in the Middle of the Stream and produced this little piece.
[02:06:08.158 --> 02:06:10.660]  We're going to play about five minutes of it and comment and analyze it.
[02:06:11.000 --> 02:06:11.820]  We've only played this once.
[02:06:11.880 --> 02:06:13.642]  It's real popular, so I should have played it again.
[02:06:13.682 --> 02:06:14.122]  I'm glad that
[02:06:14.642 --> 02:06:30.285]  Michael Rivero brought this up at WhatReallyHappened.com and when we get back we'll talk to Stuart, Eddie, Tim and others and then let Michael get more into Iran and Bush lying to take us to war and what he thinks should happen there and just state the facts because he's a real expert on that subject.
[02:06:30.345 --> 02:06:38.147]  But here is the piece where he's giving a summation to the jury about why she should be basically found not guilty.
[02:06:38.227 --> 02:06:38.727]  Here it is.
[02:06:40.740 --> 02:06:49.969]  When the weapons of mass destruction thing turned out not to be true, I expected the American people to rise up!
[02:06:52.892 --> 02:06:53.293]  They didn't.
[02:06:54.352 --> 02:07:10.440]  Then, when the Abu Ghraib torture thing surfaced, and it was revealed that our government participated in rendition, a practice where we kidnap people and turn them over to regimes who specialize in torture, I was sure then the American people would be heard from.
[02:07:10.660 --> 02:07:11.420]  We stood mute.
[02:07:12.020 --> 02:07:20.845]  Then came the news that we jailed thousands of so-called terrorist suspects, locked them up without the right to a trial or even the right to confront their accusers.
[02:07:21.245 --> 02:07:22.946]  Certainly, we would never stand for that.
[02:07:23.146 --> 02:07:23.386]  We did.
[02:07:24.500 --> 02:07:33.726]  And now, it's been discovered the executive branch has been conducting massive, illegal, domestic surveillance on its own citizens.
[02:07:34.086 --> 02:07:35.126]  You and me.
[02:07:36.027 --> 02:07:40.990]  And I at least consoled myself that finally, finally, the American people will have had enough.
[02:07:42.851 --> 02:07:43.651]  Evidently we haven't.
[02:07:44.512 --> 02:07:49.555]  In fact, if the people of this country have spoken the messages, we're okay with it all.
[02:07:50.822 --> 02:08:02.131]  Torture, warrantless search and seizures, illegal wire tappings, prison without a fair trial, or any trial, war on false pretenses.
[02:08:03.032 --> 02:08:05.754]  We as a citizenry are apparently not offended.
[02:08:06.355 --> 02:08:08.657]  There are no demonstrations on college campuses.
[02:08:08.717 --> 02:08:12.720]  In fact, there's no clear indication that young people even seem to notice.
[02:08:13.901 --> 02:08:16.043]  Well, Melissa Hughes noticed.
[02:08:17.020 --> 02:08:22.944]  Now, you might think, instead of withholding her taxes, she could have protested the old-fashioned way.
[02:08:23.164 --> 02:08:28.448]  Made a placard and demonstrated at a presidential or vice-presidential appearance.
[02:08:28.488 --> 02:08:30.049]  But we've lost the right to that as well.
[02:08:30.449 --> 02:08:38.414]  The Secret Service can now declare free speech zones to contain, control, and in effect, criminalize protests.
[02:08:38.795 --> 02:08:41.316]  Stop for a second and try to fathom that.
[02:08:42.697 --> 02:08:46.860]  At a presidential rally, parade, or appearance,
[02:08:47.640 --> 02:08:50.421]  If you have on a supportive t-shirt, you can be there.
[02:08:50.662 --> 02:08:54.384]  If you're wearing or carrying something in protest, you can be removed.
[02:08:54.744 --> 02:09:01.927]  This, in the United States of America, this, in the United States of America, is Melissa Hughes, the only one embarrassed!
[02:09:07.070 --> 02:09:10.872]  Mr. Shaw, that's a chair for witnesses only.
[02:09:11.308 --> 02:09:14.571]  Really long speeches make me so tired sometimes.
[02:09:14.851 --> 02:09:16.073]  Please get out of the chair.
[02:09:16.373 --> 02:09:17.694]  Actually, I'm sick and tired.
[02:09:17.854 --> 02:09:19.316]  Get out of the chair!
[02:09:19.336 --> 02:09:22.479]  And what I'm most sick and tired of...
[02:09:24.699 --> 02:09:32.520]  Is how every time somebody disagrees with how the government is running things, he or she is labeled un-American.
[02:09:32.600 --> 02:09:33.701]  Evidently, it's speech time.
[02:09:33.781 --> 02:09:35.841]  And speech in this country is free, you hack!
[02:09:36.161 --> 02:09:41.762]  Free for me, free for you, free for Melissa Hughes to stand up to her government and say, stick it!
[02:09:41.902 --> 02:09:42.522]  Objection!
[02:09:42.642 --> 02:09:47.583]  I object to government abusing its power to squash the constitutional freedoms of its citizenry.
[02:09:47.783 --> 02:09:49.463]  And God forbid anybody challenge it.
[02:09:49.623 --> 02:09:50.803]  They're smeared as being a heretic.
[02:09:51.003 --> 02:09:52.584]  Melissa Hughes is an American.
[02:09:52.864 --> 02:09:54.044]  Melissa Hughes.
[02:09:54.524 --> 02:09:56.445]  Last night, I went to bed with a book.
[02:09:56.465 --> 02:09:57.765]  Not as much fun as a 29-year-old.
[02:10:24.190 --> 02:10:27.072]  But, the book contained a speech by Adlai Stevenson.
[02:10:27.272 --> 02:10:27.732]  The year was 1952.
[02:10:29.353 --> 02:10:34.437]  He said, The tragedy of our day is the climate of fear in which we live.
[02:10:34.957 --> 02:10:36.478]  And fear breeds repression.
[02:10:37.218 --> 02:10:45.303]  Too often, sinister threats to the Bill of Rights, to freedom of the mind, are concealed under the patriotic cloak of anti-communism.
[02:10:49.186 --> 02:10:52.328]  Today, it's the cloak of anti-terrorism.
[02:10:54.227 --> 02:10:59.809]  Stevenson also remarked, it's far easier to fight for principles than to live up to them.
[02:11:04.790 --> 02:11:09.172]  I know we are all afraid.
[02:11:11.852 --> 02:11:17.174]  But the Bill of Rights, we have to live up to that.
[02:11:18.214 --> 02:11:19.195]  We simply must.
[02:11:22.055 --> 02:11:23.616]  That's all Melissa Hughes was trying to say.
[02:11:25.106 --> 02:11:26.027]  She was speaking for you.
[02:11:28.908 --> 02:11:33.211]  I would ask you now to go back to that room and speak for her.
[02:11:41.376 --> 02:11:41.916]  We're back.
[02:11:43.437 --> 02:11:45.558]  Michael Rivero, comments on that piece we just played?
[02:11:46.419 --> 02:11:52.603]  Well, the one part, you know, it's a wonderful speech and it was all over the net and I had it on my website for quite a while.
[02:11:53.676 --> 02:11:59.620]  The one part I disagree with the comment about where he says there are no protests, there are no protests on college campuses.
[02:12:00.101 --> 02:12:22.477]  In point of fact, there are, and I have got a web page at my site where thousands of people are showing up, but these protests are not being reported by the mainstream media, and knowing what production schedules are like on a show like Boston Legal, it's my guess they probably were just going from the reports on the mainstream media, which basically act like there is no opposition to the government,
[02:12:23.057 --> 02:12:24.858]  But in point of fact, there is.
[02:12:24.938 --> 02:12:25.998]  It's just not being reported.
[02:12:26.298 --> 02:12:29.020]  Well, it's the thing of the tree fell in the forest and nobody heard it.
[02:12:29.040 --> 02:12:29.920]  Did it make a sound?
[02:12:30.680 --> 02:12:31.741]  That old cliche.
[02:12:32.041 --> 02:12:35.582]  And time and time again, we'll have demonstrations and they'll just ignore it.
[02:12:35.662 --> 02:12:39.564]  Now, then we see Bush's PR firm with Vicente Fox, and this is admitted.
[02:12:40.339 --> 02:12:51.109]  Staging the immigration rallies for globalism, and of course misusing these downtrodden people that have been totally enslaved and hurt by NAFTA and GATT.
[02:12:52.210 --> 02:12:59.256]  You know, they're out there, but notice the media gave that massive attention to balkanize the country and get us all at each other's throats.
[02:12:59.637 --> 02:13:01.999]  Conversely, there have been huge anti-war protests.
[02:13:02.239 --> 02:13:05.942]  I mean, I've been in one with half a million people, conservatively, in New York, and they call it 100,000.
[02:13:07.461 --> 02:13:08.661]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:13:09.042 --> 02:13:17.185]  The mainstream media is very much complicit in concealing from the American public just how many of their friends and neighbors are really opposed to what's going on.
[02:13:17.485 --> 02:13:35.792]  And part of that is a means to try and discourage us from talking to each other anymore, because one of the great illusions the propagandists try to put out is that if you're unhappy with the government and you're opposed to the war, you're only one of a very few fringe group, and everybody around you loves President Bush and supports President Bush,
[02:13:36.352 --> 02:13:42.035]  And so when that message comes out, people will hear it and say, well, I better not talk about what I'm really thinking and feeling.
[02:13:42.155 --> 02:13:43.716]  Well, a month ago, they had a poll.
[02:13:43.756 --> 02:13:46.177]  The troops, it was 70% want to come home, said the war's bad.
[02:13:46.537 --> 02:13:47.718]  Now we're told it's gone above 75.
[02:13:48.898 --> 02:13:51.580]  Domestically, the official polls are Bush at 33.
[02:13:51.640 --> 02:13:52.840]  He's really below that.
[02:13:53.340 --> 02:13:55.041]  And again, I'm not saying Bush even runs anything.
[02:13:55.081 --> 02:13:55.641]  He's a puppet.
[02:13:55.862 --> 02:13:58.563]  But it shows the elite's policy is not popular.
[02:13:59.443 --> 02:14:09.860]  No absolutely it's not popular and we're obviously headed to a collision between that group that calls itself the government and we the people and it's just a point of when is that collision point
[02:14:10.655 --> 02:14:16.439]  going to occur, and will there be anything left of our country unlooted by the time we reach that?
[02:14:16.699 --> 02:14:29.588]  I'm glad you said it calls themselves that government, because if a CEO starts stealing money and raping women in his office or whatever, selling drugs, he's no longer really the CEO.
[02:14:30.289 --> 02:14:37.354]  Yeah, absolutely, because we have a document called the Constitution.
[02:14:37.893 --> 02:14:46.125]  This is our original contract with America, and it sets out what the government is, what it does, what it can do, what it cannot do.
[02:14:47.106 --> 02:14:56.912]  And the government, the people who are in the government, are the government only as long as they operate within those guidelines and rules of the Constitution.
[02:14:57.212 --> 02:15:02.135]  If they start acting outside the Constitution, then they're not functioning as the government anymore.
[02:15:02.155 --> 02:15:03.116]  I agree.
[02:15:03.496 --> 02:15:13.862]  Yeah, and of course the big one that's in there is you can go all the way through that Constitution from beginning to end, nowhere in there is the government authorized to lie to the people.
[02:15:14.255 --> 02:15:18.678]  And the 10th Amendment forbids the government from simply assuming that they have that right.
[02:15:18.718 --> 02:15:19.699]  Well, what about the leaks?
[02:15:19.819 --> 02:15:22.261]  I mean, Bush leaks on plane for political aims.
[02:15:22.541 --> 02:15:27.585]  Then another CIA agent allegedly leaked secret torture death camps that are totally illegal.
[02:15:27.685 --> 02:15:31.047]  She'd be part of a crime if she knew about it and didn't blow the whistle.
[02:15:31.087 --> 02:15:32.108]  Now they fired her.
[02:15:32.148 --> 02:15:33.409]  They're talking about charging her.
[02:15:34.048 --> 02:15:50.759]  Yeah, absolutely, and this is part of, you know, I mean, the silencing of whistleblowers actually got started back in the Clinton years, because we used to have laws in this country that protected whistleblowers, because we recognized they served an important function of exposing, you know, really bad crimes.
[02:15:50.779 --> 02:15:54.642]  Yeah, only in Nazi Germany were you not allowed to blow the whistle on the government.
[02:15:54.962 --> 02:15:56.943]  Stewart in New York, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:15:57.324 --> 02:15:58.344]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[02:15:58.925 --> 02:16:01.987]  Whatever happened to Melissa Hughes in that episode, was she acquitted?
[02:16:03.523 --> 02:16:06.546]  Actually, she was convicted, but was given a very small fine.
[02:16:07.727 --> 02:16:09.349]  That's better than nothing, I suppose.
[02:16:10.270 --> 02:16:16.015]  I may be thinking out of the box here, but you had mentioned that Bush is surrounding himself with Israelis.
[02:16:16.516 --> 02:16:23.623]  Now, on Alex's website, he's pointed out many times the long, historic, and close connection between Bush's ancestors
[02:16:24.299 --> 02:16:24.419]  Yes.
[02:16:24.540 --> 02:16:24.640]  Yes.
[02:16:40.647 --> 02:16:43.490]  Meanwhile, he's got all these Jews around him.
[02:16:43.630 --> 02:16:44.511]  Well, I think it's this.
[02:16:44.571 --> 02:16:55.121]  I think this particular group of right-wing extreme Zionists, which are the minority of Jewish organizations, they're in control, are ruthless and controlling and fit in nicely with their plan.
[02:16:55.141 --> 02:16:56.802]  I think it's birds of a feather fly together.
[02:16:56.822 --> 02:17:00.826]  There have been evil Jewish leaders, evil Russians, evil Japanese leaders.
[02:17:01.106 --> 02:17:03.208]  It's just these are evil people, so they go together.
[02:17:03.709 --> 02:17:04.429]  Peas in a pod.
[02:17:04.469 --> 02:17:05.070]  Comments, Mike?
[02:17:05.794 --> 02:17:18.718]  Well, you also have to remember that the idea that the Nazis and the Jewish people were opposite poles of a spectrum is kind of a historical distortion, because Hitler was whooping on everybody.
[02:17:18.778 --> 02:17:25.120]  He was invading France, he invaded Poland, the Sudetenland, he attacked Russia, he attacked Britain.
[02:17:25.840 --> 02:17:28.561]  It wasn't just a targeting on the Jewish people.
[02:17:30.417 --> 02:17:33.278]  We have that perspective now because of a lot of very self-centered propaganda.
[02:17:33.298 --> 02:17:33.638]  Stay there.
[02:17:33.658 --> 02:17:34.098]  Stay there.
[02:17:34.138 --> 02:17:34.699]  We've got a break.
[02:17:34.739 --> 02:17:35.179]  Stay there.
[02:17:35.199 --> 02:17:37.179]  Stuart, I'll let you finish up on the other side.
[02:17:37.760 --> 02:17:38.420]  Stay with us, folks.
[02:17:41.581 --> 02:17:47.543]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism, but globalism.
[02:17:56.288 --> 02:17:57.029]  We're good to go.
[02:18:18.968 --> 02:18:19.428]  We're good to go.
[02:18:41.449 --> 02:18:41.890]  Gold.
[02:18:42.250 --> 02:18:43.531]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[02:18:43.771 --> 02:18:49.875]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[02:18:50.055 --> 02:18:53.878]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[02:18:54.238 --> 02:18:56.119]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[02:18:56.179 --> 02:18:58.461]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[02:18:58.601 --> 02:19:05.386]  The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as the common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weaker and weaker.
[02:19:05.686 --> 02:19:06.587]  We're good to go.
[02:19:20.623 --> 02:19:27.107]  As good as gold, call 1-800-686-2237 for the report the Fed hopes you'll never see.
[02:19:27.407 --> 02:19:30.029]  As good as gold can be yours by calling 800-686-2237.
[02:19:30.309 --> 02:19:36.352]  If you have ever thought about owning gold, you must read this report.

[02:19:41.138 --> 02:19:49.767]  Berkey Water Filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[02:19:49.987 --> 02:20:01.258]  The Berkey Light's self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, salt for odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[02:20:01.478 --> 02:20:04.121]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:20:04.461 --> 02:20:10.923]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled and it can be used anywhere on a flat surface.
[02:20:11.083 --> 02:20:12.943]  That's because it has an elevated base.
[02:20:13.144 --> 02:20:19.165]  The entire system joins together to make the Berkey Light convenient to transport even while it's filtering water.
[02:20:19.425 --> 02:20:25.087]  It's rechargeable bright white LED lamps allow for optimum use at night or during emergency conditions.

[02:20:58.137 --> 02:20:58.558]  We're good to go.
[02:21:15.717 --> 02:21:16.578]  We're good to go.
[02:21:42.091 --> 02:21:44.892]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[02:21:45.412 --> 02:21:48.772]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:21:57.654 --> 02:22:00.134]  Michael Riveros, our guest, joins us each month.
[02:22:00.954 --> 02:22:01.795]  Honored to have him.
[02:22:03.495 --> 02:22:07.016]  Finishing up what you were saying in New York, Stuart.
[02:22:07.036 --> 02:22:09.376]  Finishing up what you were saying to his question, Michael.
[02:22:10.292 --> 02:22:18.735]  Well, basically that, you know, viewing World War II as strictly Nazis against the Jewish people is an historical distortion.
[02:22:19.055 --> 02:22:21.816]  The Nazis were basically, you know, attacking everybody.
[02:22:21.876 --> 02:22:26.578]  The English, the French, the Poles, the Czechs, Austria, so forth and so on.
[02:22:27.018 --> 02:22:34.641]  And so it's not quite a strange circumstance right now that you would see people very sympathetic to Israel aligning up with George Bush
[02:22:35.054 --> 02:22:38.216]  Whose family was very strongly financially connected with the Nazis.
[02:22:38.356 --> 02:22:42.058]  Well, we also had the Labor Zionists openly supporting Hitler.
[02:22:42.438 --> 02:22:43.858]  They wanted him to persecute Jews.
[02:22:43.878 --> 02:22:50.021]  They openly wrote and said, big liberal Jewish professors have written about this, to drive Jews out of Europe and make them go to Israel.
[02:22:50.782 --> 02:22:52.103]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:22:52.363 --> 02:23:03.028]  And, you know, contrary to the popular image of Nazi Germany, there were a lot of Jewish people who served in Hitler's army, and many of them were officers, even general level officers.
[02:23:03.736 --> 02:23:17.088]  And so this idea that the Jewish people were just absolutely targeted over and above everybody else is a historical distortion that has partly been used to support Israel's existence.
[02:23:17.688 --> 02:23:21.391]  I think we're trying to make a final point, Stuart, though.
[02:23:21.411 --> 02:23:22.693]  You were saying there was something behind it.
[02:23:22.733 --> 02:23:23.653]  What do you think Moshe's doing?
[02:23:24.274 --> 02:23:30.039]  My gut feeling is that maybe he's having these guys run as, shall we say, auxiliary
[02:23:30.563 --> 02:23:43.767]  Patsy's because certainly, thanks to research that you're doing and others, the prevailing 9-11 story is going down and going down fast, and they're going to need somebody else to blame, and who better else?
[02:23:43.987 --> 02:23:49.468]  I mean, the Nazis would love to pin something like this on the Jewish people.
[02:23:50.228 --> 02:23:56.390]  And I don't know, just the fact that he has them out there so open, the thing to me really smells.
[02:23:57.077 --> 02:23:59.138]  Well, I mean, we know they want to use Patsy's period.
[02:23:59.178 --> 02:24:00.138]  I appreciate the call.
[02:24:00.198 --> 02:24:03.160]  Let's talk to Eddie in Texas.
[02:24:03.200 --> 02:24:03.800]  You're on the air.
[02:24:03.860 --> 02:24:04.400]  Go ahead, Eddie.
[02:24:05.461 --> 02:24:09.622]  Yes, Alex, I just finished watching your Order of Death movie once again.
[02:24:10.163 --> 02:24:14.624]  I noticed that you were discussing that the Blairs and the Clintons were involved.
[02:24:14.664 --> 02:24:15.865]  Your phone's really muffled.
[02:24:15.905 --> 02:24:16.705]  Are you on a cordless?
[02:24:16.945 --> 02:24:17.386]  No, I'm not.
[02:24:17.686 --> 02:24:19.146]  Can you talk right into the receiver for me?
[02:24:19.486 --> 02:24:19.767]  Sure.
[02:24:20.227 --> 02:24:21.647]  I was watching the Order of Death.
[02:24:22.128 --> 02:24:22.368]  Yes.
[02:24:22.748 --> 02:24:25.289]  In the movie, you were discussing the occult activities of
[02:24:25.834 --> 02:24:26.935]  The Blairs and the Clintons.
[02:24:27.375 --> 02:24:27.636]  Yes.
[02:24:27.896 --> 02:24:33.000]  And I was curious as to why that didn't get more coverage, considering that America is supposedly a Christian nation.
[02:24:33.481 --> 02:24:45.091]  Well, I mean, it's been in major publications that every decision the Clintons, Reagan made, the Blairs make is in weird rituals with spirits, and I mean, that's part of the record.
[02:24:45.111 --> 02:24:46.011]  These people are nuts.
[02:24:46.072 --> 02:24:47.553]  Michael Rivero, you want to comment on that?
[02:24:48.351 --> 02:25:07.906]  Well, I think basically in a nation where we talk about a Christian nation, but in reality we have freedom of religion and some people get into some very interesting views of what their religion is and in some people they will use that religion as an excuse or justification to sort of do what they want to do anyway.
[02:25:08.387 --> 02:25:13.871]  And I think we see that a lot in world leaders who may not be doing things that we would agree with
[02:25:14.304 --> 02:25:19.907]  And somewhere, you know, they're going to lay it off and blame it on their particular god or gods that they're worshipping.
[02:25:20.147 --> 02:25:21.727]  We've certainly seen George Bush do it.
[02:25:21.987 --> 02:25:24.088]  He's saying God drives his foreign policy.
[02:25:24.729 --> 02:25:26.269]  God told him to attack Iraq.
[02:25:26.890 --> 02:25:34.733]  And this, of course, is a very dangerous sign, because once you start citing holy authority for what you're doing, anything becomes possible.
[02:25:34.773 --> 02:25:40.756]  Well, he's doing this as an emotional sab for so-called Christian conservatives in this country.
[02:25:41.377 --> 02:25:51.282]  Yeah, he's definitely starting to lose a lot of his support from the religious right, who realize that he's basically batting 500 on violating all 10 of the Ten Commandments.
[02:25:51.502 --> 02:25:52.903]  Yeah, let's take a final call here.
[02:25:52.943 --> 02:25:55.324]  Let's talk to Tim in New York.
[02:25:55.364 --> 02:25:56.064]  Tim, go ahead.
[02:25:57.105 --> 02:25:58.125]  Good afternoon, gentlemen.
[02:25:58.165 --> 02:25:59.106]  A wonderful show.
[02:25:59.286 --> 02:26:03.328]  Alex, I called to tell you we showed loose change in Rochester, New York.
[02:26:03.688 --> 02:26:05.349]  We had a tremendous outpouring.
[02:26:05.871 --> 02:26:12.999]  On May 16th at 7pm, the Little Theater in Rochester, New York, we are going to show Marshall Law.
[02:26:13.659 --> 02:26:15.441]  Hope people will come out and support us.
[02:26:15.762 --> 02:26:16.342]  When is that?
[02:26:16.903 --> 02:26:20.967]  May 16th, in Rochester, New York, at the Little Theater.
[02:26:21.327 --> 02:26:21.808]  What time?
[02:26:22.515 --> 02:26:23.775]  Uh, 7 p.m.
[02:26:24.155 --> 02:26:25.196]  Okay, fantastic!
[02:26:25.816 --> 02:26:30.336]  And, uh... You want to buy a bunch of them from me in bulk and sell them there, sell DVDs?
[02:26:30.957 --> 02:26:36.317]  Oh, we'll do what we can, but we're going to do this on a recurring basis.
[02:26:37.338 --> 02:26:43.519]  Probably 9-11 Road to Tyranny will be the next one, but we thank people that listen and come out and support us.
[02:26:44.159 --> 02:26:44.719]  Okay.
[02:26:45.279 --> 02:26:48.720]  One of the interesting things you said was how people feel so alone.
[02:26:48.780 --> 02:26:50.340]  Well, this is what people need to do
[02:26:50.922 --> 02:26:53.784]  To get out there and see that there's more of us out here.
[02:26:54.484 --> 02:27:05.530]  We met people that listened to the show that we never had any idea of in the Rochester area and we met a lot of great new people and we found out there's a lot of us out here fighting this fight.
[02:27:05.630 --> 02:27:07.951]  And sir, what station are you listening to us on now?
[02:27:08.892 --> 02:27:11.093]  We're on the Sunshine Radio Network, 1310 AM.
[02:27:11.113 --> 02:27:11.373]  Alright.
[02:27:13.703 --> 02:27:15.104]  A lot of great affiliates up in that area.
[02:27:15.124 --> 02:27:16.704]  I've got three good ones in upstate New York.
[02:27:17.185 --> 02:27:19.426]  Michael Rivero, will you do five more minutes with me?
[02:27:19.986 --> 02:27:20.506]  Absolutely.
[02:27:20.806 --> 02:27:25.429]  Okay, I want you to be able to talk about Bush lying about the war, how important that is.
[02:27:25.509 --> 02:27:28.950]  Just that on its own is enough for impeachment and his arrest.
[02:27:29.170 --> 02:27:29.891]  We'll be right back.
[02:27:29.951 --> 02:27:31.031]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:27:31.812 --> 02:27:32.692]  We're on the march.
[02:27:33.192 --> 02:27:34.793]  The empire's on the run.
[02:27:35.714 --> 02:27:38.395]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:41.593 --> 02:27:43.675]  Gee, honey, those new sandals look great on you.
[02:27:43.875 --> 02:27:46.096]  And look, they show off my new toenails, too.
[02:27:46.417 --> 02:27:47.097]  New toenails?
[02:27:47.457 --> 02:27:48.458]  What happened to the old ones?
[02:27:49.439 --> 02:27:52.101]  Well, they're not really new, just clear and healthy looking.
[02:27:52.662 --> 02:27:54.082]  Remember how embarrassed I was?
[02:27:54.102 --> 02:27:56.883]  They were so discolored, really awful looking.
[02:27:57.123 --> 02:27:58.484]  Well, they sure look clear now.
[02:27:58.504 --> 02:28:00.604]  Gosh, I wish I could wear sandals again.
[02:28:00.764 --> 02:28:02.125]  My toenails are a disaster.
[02:28:02.165 --> 02:28:04.985]  Look, this one looks white, and that one's thick and yellow.
[02:28:05.185 --> 02:28:06.446]  Well, here's my secret.
[02:28:07.006 --> 02:28:08.046]  Non-X Nail Gel.
[02:28:08.526 --> 02:28:12.607]  It clears out yellowing keratin debris, the source of nail discoloration.
[02:28:13.327 --> 02:28:14.208]  Ah, so that's it.
[02:28:14.468 --> 02:28:17.008]  I've got ugly keratin debris built up under my nails.
[02:28:17.288 --> 02:28:18.909]  And Non-X Nail Gel gets rid of it.
[02:28:19.529 --> 02:28:22.511]  You'll need to use it every day, but clear nails are worth it.
[02:28:22.891 --> 02:28:23.431]  You bet!
[02:28:23.651 --> 02:28:27.753]  You know, when we go to the beach this summer, my toenails are going to look just as good as yours do.
[02:28:27.913 --> 02:28:29.454]  Thanks to Non-X Nail Gel.
[02:28:29.834 --> 02:28:30.975]  Non-X Nail Gel.
[02:28:31.135 --> 02:28:32.795]  For clear, healthy looking nails.
[02:28:33.176 --> 02:28:38.278]  Now at Walgreens, Rite Aid, Eckerd, Brooks, Long's, Duane Reade, and Walmart.
[02:28:38.458 --> 02:28:39.499]  In the foot care section.
[02:28:41.869 --> 02:28:44.873]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[02:28:45.214 --> 02:28:54.025]  It's portable and requires no water pressure, so you can enjoy healthy drinking water, whether it's during normal times or hostile environments, like a local or national emergency.
[02:28:54.366 --> 02:28:59.032]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[02:28:59.492 --> 02:29:06.220]  The Murky Lot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[02:29:06.621 --> 02:29:18.415]  It also removes foul taste and odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury, while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:29:18.875 --> 02:29:23.336]  The Berkey Light's rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.
[02:29:23.496 --> 02:29:25.957]  Get the Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:29:25.977 --> 02:29:27.797]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[02:29:27.837 --> 02:29:29.058]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[02:29:29.098 --> 02:29:30.558]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[02:29:30.578 --> 02:29:31.618]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:29:40.874 --> 02:29:42.355]  Hey folks, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:29:42.695 --> 02:29:46.658]  You've all heard me on the radio talking about the importance of investing in precious metals.
[02:29:47.038 --> 02:29:50.560]  I feel it's time for me to talk about the importance of investing in your health.
[02:29:50.940 --> 02:29:54.483]  I was presented with the opportunity to try Tri-Vibes from TriVortex.
[02:29:54.883 --> 02:29:59.746]  I was a bit hesitant of the idea of absorbing vitamins by wearing them rather than ingesting them.
[02:30:00.066 --> 02:30:05.869]  After conducting one of the tests found at TriVortex.com, I was convinced that the product might actually work.
[02:30:06.170 --> 02:30:09.892]  I now wear my TriVibes bands daily, and I'm feeling better than ever.
[02:30:10.232 --> 02:30:12.313]  Not only physically, but also mentally.
[02:30:12.653 --> 02:30:18.417]  TriVortex also offers amazingly beneficial and beautiful jewelry worn by the women around the office daily.
[02:30:18.837 --> 02:30:20.018]  TriVortex is amazing.
[02:30:20.358 --> 02:30:21.478]  Don't take my word for it.
[02:30:21.558 --> 02:30:26.960]  Try TriVortex yourself and have fun and learn with the tests found on TriVortex.com.
[02:30:27.160 --> 02:30:30.622]  That's T-R-I-V-O-R-T-E-X dot com.
[02:30:30.902 --> 02:30:32.202]  Or call my friend Brian at 619-884-1455.
[02:30:32.222 --> 02:30:32.542]  That's 619-884-1455.
[02:30:47.575 --> 02:30:48.496]  I love my family.
[02:30:48.536 --> 02:30:49.377]  I love this country.
[02:30:49.397 --> 02:30:50.878]  I want my children to go up free.
[02:30:50.998 --> 02:30:53.860]  I know we have psychopathic control freaks that are in control.
[02:30:54.440 --> 02:30:55.521]  They must be resisted.
[02:30:55.581 --> 02:30:58.123]  Michael Rivera, I bring this up with almost every guest because it's important.
[02:30:58.584 --> 02:31:05.829]  John Yoo, one of the deputy counsels at the White House, openly in memos, and he admits he wrote it, said they can torture small children sexually in front of their parents.
[02:31:06.610 --> 02:31:07.410]  He defended that.
[02:31:07.430 --> 02:31:10.092]  I mean, this is... I mean, the Nazis didn't do that openly.
[02:31:10.112 --> 02:31:11.754]  They just did it secretly.
[02:31:12.294 --> 02:31:15.897]  And then the Attorney General says killing people by torture is okay.
[02:31:15.937 --> 02:31:17.078]  I mean, these people are psychopaths.
[02:31:17.933 --> 02:31:31.778]  Well, absolutely, and it's a very dangerous situation because if they're doing it to Iraqis who were really ultimately innocent of any crime at all, then the day will come when they're going to do it here to Americans simply for refusing to believe what the government says.
[02:31:31.898 --> 02:31:38.320]  They're setting the precedent, and Bush told his biographer in 1999 that he's going to be a war president, so he can't be questioned domestically.
[02:31:38.620 --> 02:31:46.663]  That brings us to the premeditated staged intelligence for the invasion of Iraq using duplicate propaganda on Iran.
[02:31:48.077 --> 02:31:48.998]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:31:49.078 --> 02:31:57.163]  At this point, you know, it is unavoidable that the Bush administration deliberately lied us into war with Iran.
[02:31:58.063 --> 02:31:59.844]  The evidence is overwhelming.
[02:32:00.885 --> 02:32:09.310]  First and foremost, of course, the Downing Street Minutes, which basically just exposed the fixing of the intelligence, as they put it.
[02:32:09.790 --> 02:32:13.493]  The Niger documents about the Yellow Cake Uranium, they were forgeries.
[02:32:13.813 --> 02:32:15.034]  Now we have a State Department
[02:32:16.010 --> 02:32:35.469]  Memo that was either declassified or leaked out which basically made it clear that both the State Department and the CIA were telling the White House that Iraq did not have weapons of mass destruction weeks before Bush's 2003 State of the Union speech and before the invasion and Bush just shrugged his shoulders and went ahead and did it anyway.
[02:32:36.050 --> 02:32:44.393]  So, in my mind, there can be no greater crime committed by a leader against his people than to lie to them in order to start a war.
[02:32:44.813 --> 02:32:51.916]  And I realize that wars are usually started with a lie, because most people don't want to go through the hassle of a war without a good reason.
[02:32:52.516 --> 02:32:55.817]  So, you know, history is full of wars started with lies.
[02:32:55.857 --> 02:33:00.979]  Hitler told the Germans Poland was about to attack, and that's how that invasion was organized.
[02:33:01.339 --> 02:33:05.301]  But what is unique about this situation, and it's a historic first,
[02:33:05.817 --> 02:33:35.085]  is that the lies are exposed and widely known while the war started with those lies is still going on and this is the first time in history that has happened and it is due to radio shows like yours and websites like ours and uh... uh... you know what is left to be seen now is if the american people will just continue to go along with it uh... the way the germans did with hitler or if it's clear they mean to just keep going all the way it's clear total real live hellhole dictatorship is the plan we've got to stop it
[02:33:35.603 --> 02:33:36.383]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:33:36.423 --> 02:33:37.784]  They will not stop themselves.
[02:33:37.804 --> 02:33:38.604]  They have no interest.
[02:33:38.624 --> 02:33:39.784]  Well, it's a Ponzi scheme.
[02:33:39.824 --> 02:33:41.945]  They're going to fall if they don't keep making it bigger.
[02:33:42.585 --> 02:33:43.205]  Absolutely.
[02:33:43.365 --> 02:33:43.885]  Absolutely.
[02:33:44.625 --> 02:33:50.367]  And if I have time for one more comment, I'd like to go back to the gentleman who said he was showing your movie to a group of people.
[02:33:50.407 --> 02:33:53.748]  There's another option that your readers and listeners can do.
[02:33:54.208 --> 02:34:00.310]  If they have purchased your videotapes and DVDs, they can go to their local cable television station.
[02:34:00.330 --> 02:34:02.090]  There's a thing called Community Access.
[02:34:02.580 --> 02:34:09.325]  Where you can go on and you can put any show you want on the Community Access Channel and by law, they have to let you do it.
[02:34:09.986 --> 02:34:19.454]  And in fact, the first place I ever saw the Clinton Chronicles, which was an excellent videotape about the corruption of that administration, was on a cable TV channel.
[02:34:20.034 --> 02:34:22.196]  We aired it over a hundred times here locally.
[02:34:22.216 --> 02:34:25.759]  It was the most requested ever and it aired nationwide and really hurt Clinton.
[02:34:26.099 --> 02:34:28.301]  Michael Rivero, we'll talk to you again in another month.
[02:34:28.341 --> 02:34:29.422]  It was a real honor having you on.
[02:34:29.442 --> 02:34:30.222]  Thanks for all the time.
[02:34:30.663 --> 02:34:31.003]  Thank you.
[02:34:32.179 --> 02:34:33.780]  Alright folks, here goes Michael Rivero.
[02:34:34.120 --> 02:34:41.166]  I've had so many requests to replay this, I'm going to re-air the Jim Garrison summation from JFK here in just a few minutes.
[02:34:41.306 --> 02:34:42.246]  Not yet, guys.
[02:34:42.446 --> 02:34:42.727]  Not yet.
[02:34:42.747 --> 02:34:47.810]  We're going to do that at 42 minutes 34 seconds, okay?
[02:34:49.512 --> 02:34:51.953]  But that is coming up in just a few minutes.
[02:34:52.774 --> 02:34:58.398]  I just want to spend a few minutes, though, here talking about A Scanner Darkly, a Philip K. Dick book,
[02:34:59.216 --> 02:35:11.268]  About a futuristic nightmare society where the government and private mercenary corporations control the drug trade to enslave the population, to addict them, and then to incarcerate them.
[02:35:11.288 --> 02:35:20.917]  It illustrates how drugs can be used at every level to profit the elite and then they make even bigger profits off of
[02:35:21.737 --> 02:35:28.161]  Policing then the crime and destruction that is caused by an illegal drug trade.
[02:35:28.421 --> 02:35:31.483]  So this is an official Warner Brothers independent film.
[02:35:31.563 --> 02:35:33.104]  And I know the people involved in it.
[02:35:33.884 --> 02:35:35.105]  They understand the New World Order.
[02:35:35.145 --> 02:35:36.306]  They know what's going on.
[02:35:36.886 --> 02:35:39.908]  This is a serious political statement unlike I've ever seen.
[02:35:39.948 --> 02:35:44.911]  If you like Beef or Vendetta and films like Seriana, well this is the next step in that.
[02:35:45.598 --> 02:35:48.120]  It is a revolutionary system of rotoscoping.
[02:35:48.240 --> 02:35:50.141]  Each frame is a work of art.
[02:35:50.501 --> 02:35:54.343]  They shoot live action video, digital video, and then edit it.
[02:35:54.703 --> 02:35:56.204]  And of course, I am in the film.
[02:35:56.224 --> 02:35:59.146]  I also did some consulting on the film.
[02:35:59.166 --> 02:36:05.670]  I have a rant in the film against the controlled drug trade being used as a crisis.
[02:36:07.498 --> 02:36:10.219]  And there's so many facets to this film.
[02:36:10.300 --> 02:36:13.681]  The website is ScannerDarklyMovie.com.
[02:36:13.901 --> 02:36:16.743]  S-C-A-N-N-E-R DarklyMovie.com.
[02:36:17.103 --> 02:36:20.945]  That's an allusion to the rose-colored Darkly in the Bible.
[02:36:20.965 --> 02:36:23.966]  They even have a Bible quote on the website.
[02:36:24.727 --> 02:36:29.169]  And the addictive drug is Substance D or Substance Death.
[02:36:30.812 --> 02:36:34.996]  And, of course, there's just amazing humor throughout the film as well.
[02:36:35.036 --> 02:36:41.141]  It's a mix of things I've never really seen in a movie.
[02:36:41.161 --> 02:36:48.107]  When I watched it during South by Southwest, I mean, it was a new experience.
[02:36:48.127 --> 02:36:51.069]  It was something truly avant-garde.
[02:36:52.030 --> 02:36:58.756]  And the developers, Richard Linklater, the director, a good friend of mine,
[02:37:00.094 --> 02:37:12.423]  He did years of study on the latest police state developments, the face scanners, the biometrics, and the good old-fashioned Stasi secret police, you know, one in ten being a spy.
[02:37:13.544 --> 02:37:22.311]  And so he also brings that to the film, and they studied real police state developments and integrated that with the original vision of Philip K. Dick, the popular
[02:37:23.257 --> 02:37:40.636]  Legendary science fiction writer who originally wrote A Scanner Darkly, which is really his autobiography of how drugs and the phony drug war destroyed so many of his friends, who he describes as just being like children who didn't know not to play in the street, but who were damaged and had horrible things happen to them.
[02:37:42.550 --> 02:37:47.495]  But it's set in 2011 in a near future police state.
[02:37:47.595 --> 02:37:49.757]  It is so cutting edge.
[02:37:49.797 --> 02:37:54.122]  The website is absolutely beautiful and dynamic and is going to be expanded.
[02:37:56.164 --> 02:38:06.834]  And the film, again, integrates real police state developments and what's really happening into this near future dystopic world.
[02:38:07.638 --> 02:38:10.521]  And it is so radical, it is so cutting-edge.
[02:38:10.961 --> 02:38:14.705]  Cutting-edge is kind of a cheesy word, it's been overused, but it is totally avant-garde.
[02:38:15.145 --> 02:38:15.746]  It is new.
[02:38:15.806 --> 02:38:33.282]  I mean, just the rotoscoping, the cinematography, the incredible performances, so much dialogue with Woody Harrelson, Winona Ryder, Keanu Reeves, and just all these other amazing actors that are in it.
[02:38:34.381 --> 02:38:46.810]  And then you look at the fact that they made the movie for a little over 9 million dollars when normally Keanu Reeves gets about 20 million dollars a movie made over 200 million on his last Matrix film
[02:38:47.592 --> 02:38:51.556]  And here he is, he was paid what, $70,000 roughly.
[02:38:51.576 --> 02:39:08.010]  I mean, they did this because they were so committed to the vision that to be able to make it on their own and not have any of the controls put on them by Warner Brothers or Warner Independent, that they did it for $9 million.
[02:39:08.070 --> 02:39:12.454]  Imagine taking a pay cut of over $19 million just with one of the actors
[02:39:12.874 --> 02:39:17.956]  And only getting a $70,000 to then go and make this film.
[02:39:17.996 --> 02:39:29.540]  I mean, I don't think it's been many years since Keanu Reeves took the union rate of just what basically a beginning actor would be paid in a film.
[02:39:29.640 --> 02:39:33.842]  So that's what they had to go through to bring you this film.
[02:39:34.242 --> 02:39:35.342]  It is a masterpiece.
[02:39:35.402 --> 02:39:36.783]  I am so honored to be part of it.
[02:39:37.183 --> 02:39:38.343]  Everybody needs to go see it.
[02:39:38.383 --> 02:39:39.564]  It opens in select theaters.
[02:39:40.715 --> 02:39:44.901]  Coming up on July 7th and then nationwide a few weeks later.
[02:39:45.001 --> 02:39:46.383]  Tell everyone about it!
[02:39:46.583 --> 02:39:55.174]  We need to support real, groundbreaking, revolutionary, trailblazing films like this so it will be successful so you can see more of it.
[02:39:55.615 --> 02:40:00.059]  They're taking a major risk by doing this, and they can only be commended.
[02:40:00.360 --> 02:40:06.025]  And of course, Oliver Stone took another major risk making the film that you're about to hear an eight-minute clip from.
[02:40:06.305 --> 02:40:08.888]  This is from Oliver Stone's JFK.
[02:40:09.368 --> 02:40:11.230]  The websites are InfoWars.com.
[02:40:11.250 --> 02:40:12.871]  We'll be right back with the final segment.
[02:40:15.574 --> 02:40:20.439]  Hitler always said, the bigger the lie, the more people will believe it.
[02:40:22.290 --> 02:40:29.955]  Lee Harvey Oswald, a crazed, lonely man who wanted attention and got it by killing a president, was only the first in a long line of patsies.
[02:40:31.136 --> 02:40:39.862]  In later years, Bobby Kennedy, Martin Luther King, men whose commitment to change and peace would make them dangerous to men who have committed the war would follow.
[02:40:41.123 --> 02:40:43.504]  Also killed by such lonely, crazed men.
[02:40:44.925 --> 02:40:48.808]  Men who remove our guilt by making murder a meaningless act of aloneness.
[02:40:50.486 --> 02:40:56.728]  We've all become hamlets in our country, children of a slain father leader whose killers still possess the throne.
[02:40:57.789 --> 02:41:03.150]  The ghost of John F. Kennedy confronts us with the secret murder at the heart of the American dream.
[02:41:04.031 --> 02:41:07.752]  He forces on us the appalling questions of what has our Constitution made?
[02:41:09.141 --> 02:41:11.482]  What is our citizenship and more our lives worth?
[02:41:11.522 --> 02:41:20.847]  What is the future of a democracy where a president can be assassinated under conspicuously suspicious circumstances while the machinery of legal action scarcely trembles?
[02:41:22.468 --> 02:41:28.731]  How many more political murders to size as heart attacks, suicides, cancers, drug overdoses?
[02:41:28.911 --> 02:41:33.574]  How many airplane and car crashes will occur before they are exposed for what they are?
[02:41:35.975 --> 02:41:38.376]  Treason doth never prosper, wrote an English poet.
[02:41:39.758 --> 02:41:40.318]  What's the reason?
[02:41:41.939 --> 02:41:44.000]  Well, if it prospers, none dare call it treason.
[02:41:45.360 --> 02:41:47.561]  The American public is yet to see the Zapruder film.
[02:41:49.022 --> 02:41:49.262]  Why?
[02:41:50.583 --> 02:41:54.705]  The American public is yet to see the real x-rays and photographs of the autopsy.
[02:41:54.925 --> 02:41:55.365]  Why?
[02:41:56.825 --> 02:41:59.907]  There are hundreds of documents that could help prove this conspiracy.
[02:42:00.167 --> 02:42:02.508]  Why are they being withheld or burned by the government?
[02:42:04.366 --> 02:42:09.028]  Each time my office or you the people have asked those questions demanded crucial evidence.
[02:42:09.089 --> 02:42:12.490]  The answer from on high has always been national security.
[02:42:14.071 --> 02:42:17.453]  What kind of national security do we have when we've been robbed of our leaders?
[02:42:18.794 --> 02:42:27.198]  What national security permits the removal of fundamental power from the hands of the American people and validates the ascendancy of invisible government in the United States?
[02:42:29.209 --> 02:42:34.333]  That kind of national security, gentlemen of the jury, is when it smells like it, feels like it, and looks like it.
[02:42:35.333 --> 02:42:36.354]  You call it what it is.
[02:42:41.137 --> 02:42:47.082]  I submit to you that what took place on November 22, 1963 was a coup d'etat.
[02:42:48.623 --> 02:42:54.567]  Its most direct and tragic result was the reversal of President Kennedy's commitment to withdraw from Vietnam.
[02:42:56.397 --> 02:43:01.119]  The war is the biggest business in America worth $80 billion a year.
[02:43:02.399 --> 02:43:17.804]  President Kennedy was murdered by a conspiracy that was planned in advance at the highest levels of our government, and it was carried out by fanatical and disciplined cold warriors in the Pentagon and CIA's covert operation apparatus, among them Kalei Shah here before you.
[02:43:19.102 --> 02:43:35.211]  It was a public execution, and it was covered up by like-minded individuals in the Dallas Police Department, the Secret Service, the FBI, and the White House, all the way up to, including J. Edgar Hoover and Lyndon Johnson, whom I consider accomplices after the fact.
[02:43:36.232 --> 02:43:39.874]  The assassination reduced the President to a transient official.
[02:43:40.816 --> 02:43:51.720]  His job, his assignment, is to speak as often as possible of this nation's desire for peace while he acts as a business agent in the Congress for the military and their hardware manufacturers.
[02:43:53.941 --> 02:43:55.561]  Now some people say I'm crazy.
[02:43:57.622 --> 02:44:00.303]  Southern caricatures seeking higher office.
[02:44:02.704 --> 02:44:05.505]  Well there is a simple way to determine if I am paranoid.
[02:44:06.286 --> 02:44:17.553]  Let's ask the two men who profited the most from the assassination, your former president Lyndon Baines Johnson and your new president Richard Nixon, to release the 51 CIA documents pertaining to Lee Harvey Oswald and Jack Ruby.
[02:44:18.814 --> 02:44:24.497]  All the secret CIA memo on Oswald's activities in Russia that was destroyed while being photocopied.
[02:44:25.157 --> 02:44:26.558]  All these documents are yours.
[02:44:27.599 --> 02:44:28.520]  The people's property.
[02:44:28.700 --> 02:44:29.480]  You pay for it.
[02:44:30.981 --> 02:44:35.884]  But because the government considers you children who might be too disturbed or distressed to face this reality,
[02:44:36.974 --> 02:44:39.254]  Or because you might possibly lynch those involved?
[02:44:40.695 --> 02:44:43.475]  You cannot see these documents for another 75 years.
[02:44:44.895 --> 02:44:46.536]  I'm in my early 40s.
[02:44:47.756 --> 02:45:04.899]  So I'll have shuffled off this mortal coil by then, but I'm already telling my 8-year-old son to keep himself physically fit, so that one glorious September morning in the year 2038, he can walk into the National Archives and find out what the CIA and the FBI knew!
[02:45:06.653 --> 02:45:08.114]  They may even push it back then.
[02:45:08.174 --> 02:45:10.134]  Hell, it may become a generational affair.
[02:45:10.494 --> 02:45:13.756]  With questions passed down, father to son, mother to daughter.
[02:45:14.036 --> 02:45:17.937]  But someday, somewhere, someone may find out the damn truth.
[02:45:19.037 --> 02:45:19.538]  We better.
[02:45:21.298 --> 02:45:24.599]  We better, or we might just as well build ourselves another government.
[02:45:25.480 --> 02:45:31.342]  Like the Declaration of Independence says to, when the old one ain't working, just the little father out west.
[02:45:33.462 --> 02:45:34.803]  The American naturalist wrote,
[02:45:35.759 --> 02:45:40.280]  A patriot must always be ready to defend his country against its government.
[02:45:42.840 --> 02:45:44.260]  I'd hate to be in your shoes today.
[02:45:45.681 --> 02:45:46.701]  You have a lot to think about.
[02:45:46.721 --> 02:45:49.581]  You've seen much hidden evidence the American public has never seen.
[02:45:51.562 --> 02:45:59.383]  You know, going back to when we were children, I think that most of us in this courtroom thought that justice came into being automatically.
[02:46:00.643 --> 02:46:02.224]  That virtue was its own reward.
[02:46:02.584 --> 02:46:04.044]  That good would triumph over evil.
[02:46:05.933 --> 02:46:08.194]  But as we get older, we know this just isn't true.
[02:46:09.814 --> 02:46:12.455]  Individual human beings have to create justice.
[02:46:12.475 --> 02:46:13.455]  And this is not easy.
[02:46:15.296 --> 02:46:17.716]  Because the truth often poses a threat to power.
[02:46:18.917 --> 02:46:21.797]  And one often has to buy power at great risk to themselves.
[02:46:22.638 --> 02:46:23.518]  People like S.M.
[02:46:23.558 --> 02:46:29.980]  Holland, Lee Bowers, Gene Hill, Willie O'Keefe, have all taken that risk.
[02:46:30.000 --> 02:46:31.060]  They've all come forward.
[02:46:32.660 --> 02:46:33.921]  I have here some $8,000 in these letters sent
[02:46:36.189 --> 02:46:38.129]  Sent to my office from all over the country.
[02:46:38.890 --> 02:46:44.771]  Quarters, dimes, dollar bills from housewives, plumbers, car salesmen, teachers, ambulance.
[02:46:46.271 --> 02:46:48.912]  These are people who cannot afford to send money to do.
[02:46:50.592 --> 02:46:56.814]  These are the ones who drive the cabs, who nurse in the hospitals, who see their kids go to Vietnam.
[02:46:58.554 --> 02:46:58.874]  Why?
[02:47:01.115 --> 02:47:02.095]  Because they care.
[02:47:03.516 --> 02:47:05.036]  Because they want to know the truth.
[02:47:06.380 --> 02:47:07.801]  Because I want the country back.
[02:47:08.481 --> 02:47:09.962]  Because it still belongs to us.
[02:47:11.083 --> 02:47:13.705]  As long as the people have the guts to fight for what they believe in.
[02:47:17.467 --> 02:47:19.689]  The truth is the most important value we have.
[02:47:19.789 --> 02:47:31.657]  Because if the truth does not endure, if the government murders truth, if we cannot respect the hearts of these people, then this is not the country in which I was born, and it is certainly not the country that I want to die in.
[02:47:31.677 --> 02:47:34.479]  Tennyson wrote,
[02:47:35.259 --> 02:47:36.820]  Authority forgets a dying king.
[02:47:39.341 --> 02:47:46.964]  This was never more true than for John F. Kennedy, whose murder was probably one of the most terrible moments in the history of our country.
[02:47:50.526 --> 02:48:00.010]  You, the people, the jury system sitting in judgment on Clay Shaw, represent the hope of humanity against government power.
[02:48:01.910 --> 02:48:03.091]  In discharging your duty,
[02:48:04.500 --> 02:48:13.904]  In bringing the first conviction in this House of Cards against Clay Shaw, that's not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country.
[02:48:15.644 --> 02:48:18.865]  Do not forget your dying king.
[02:48:21.146 --> 02:48:27.909]  Show this world that this is still a government of the people, for the people, and by the people.
[02:48:30.650 --> 02:48:33.911]  Nothing as long as you live will ever be more important.
[02:48:37.864 --> 02:48:38.485]  It's up to you.
[02:48:42.328 --> 02:48:45.270]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[02:48:45.930 --> 02:48:47.231]  Alex Jones here, America.

[02:51:50.080 --> 02:51:54.782]  The issue of our government wallowing with the murdering communist Chinese government is very important.
[02:51:54.802 --> 02:51:56.543]  So in the first hour tomorrow, be sure and tune in.
[02:51:56.883 --> 02:51:57.543]  A lot of you missed it.
[02:51:57.563 --> 02:52:16.171]  I'm going to re-air that Monday interview with the, well first it will be Glenn Spencer, then 35 minutes I did, half an hour, then five minutes, then the next hour with the Chinese American doctor, Mrs. Wong, who stood up to Lord Bush and Lord Hu.
[02:52:17.032 --> 02:52:19.413]  That is going to be coming up tomorrow.
[02:52:22.248 --> 02:52:36.878]  You know, in the closing few minutes I have left, I was just thinking about the people that have made so many sacrifices against tyranny and evil in this country, and they didn't do it for no reason.
[02:52:36.918 --> 02:52:41.661]  They didn't do it, and what they did didn't fall on deaf ears.
[02:52:42.322 --> 02:52:46.765]  It didn't fall on, you know, the rocks.
[02:52:46.985 --> 02:52:48.506]  It fell into fertile soil.
[02:52:49.147 --> 02:52:49.567]  It grew.
[02:52:51.713 --> 02:53:02.220]  And if we didn't have all these trailblazers before us, who stood up against corruption, who stood up against tyranny, who stood up against evil, we would be in a much worse position today.
[02:53:02.260 --> 02:53:13.847]  I know things aren't perfect, things are bad, things look bleak, but there's a lot of rays of hope and sunshine and silver linings on these thunderheads that we witness over our humanity, our society, our world today.
[02:53:15.248 --> 02:53:18.810]  And you heard John F. McManus, John Birch Society head in the first hour,
[02:53:19.873 --> 02:53:23.476]  Saying they're going to change directions and get more hardcore now, and maybe even talk about 9-11.
[02:53:24.177 --> 02:53:30.441]  They've had a shake-up over there, that's encouraging, but he agreed that as things get worse, more and more people will wake up.
[02:53:31.582 --> 02:53:35.766]  And Michael Rivero of WhatReallyHappened.com agreed with that analysis as well.
[02:53:35.846 --> 02:53:39.068]  So, understand, we make the world what it is.
[02:53:40.169 --> 02:53:43.892]  That's God's promise that if we stand up and do the right thing, we will have an effect.
[02:53:47.353 --> 02:53:49.154]  I'm very thankful for the Genesis Network.
[02:53:49.174 --> 02:53:51.336]  I'm very thankful for some of the other Patriot Networks that are out there.
[02:53:51.896 --> 02:53:54.879]  I'm very thankful for the AM and FM stations that pick up this broadcast.

[02:53:59.622 --> 02:54:02.544]  And it's very important for the listeners to support our AM and FM affiliates.
[02:54:03.385 --> 02:54:05.066]  It's very important to support the Genesis Network.
[02:54:05.086 --> 02:54:07.848]  It's very important to support what we're doing here.
[02:54:09.890 --> 02:54:10.490]  What I'm doing.
[02:54:10.550 --> 02:54:12.551]  Because I'm dedicated to this fight.
[02:54:12.592 --> 02:54:13.892]  I work very long hours.
[02:54:15.481 --> 02:54:16.642]  Do everything I can.
[02:54:17.263 --> 02:54:19.364]  We work ourselves to the bone.
[02:54:20.005 --> 02:54:21.906]  We frantically work here at this office.
[02:54:21.986 --> 02:54:24.268]  And so does Paul Watson and Steve Watson over in England.
[02:54:24.749 --> 02:54:25.449]  Part of our team.
[02:54:25.469 --> 02:54:27.471]  And so does Dwayne Cooch in Louisiana.
[02:54:29.152 --> 02:54:31.334]  All the people that make this broadcast possible.
[02:54:31.354 --> 02:54:33.056]  The folks at The Network in Minneapolis-St.
[02:54:33.076 --> 02:54:33.296]  Paul.
[02:54:33.316 --> 02:54:35.197]  They're in a suburb of Burnsville.
[02:54:37.299 --> 02:54:39.321]  And so know that we're all together in this.
[02:54:39.361 --> 02:54:40.362]  We're all in the same boat.
[02:54:40.622 --> 02:54:42.323]  And we're having a lot of victories.
[02:54:42.363 --> 02:54:44.465]  And we're striving ever onward and upward.
[02:54:45.228 --> 02:54:46.989]  And so, you're all to be commended.
[02:54:47.009 --> 02:54:56.996]  Every one of you that told somebody about the show, or everybody that emailed out the web address for InfoWars.com, or everybody that sends out the news articles that we put a lot of blood, sweat, and tears into writing and a lot of research.
[02:54:57.636 --> 02:54:59.237]  A lot of black circles around our eyes.
[02:54:59.958 --> 02:55:06.322]  All of you that have made copies of my films and aired them on AXS TV, whether it's 10 copies or 6,000 copies, as some people have done.
[02:55:06.762 --> 02:55:07.543]  I salute you.
[02:55:07.623 --> 02:55:08.223]  I commend you.
[02:55:08.263 --> 02:55:08.783]  We're brothers.
[02:55:08.823 --> 02:55:09.424]  We're sisters.
[02:55:09.804 --> 02:55:11.165]  We're brethren together.
[02:55:11.829 --> 02:55:15.650]  And I've been honored to be in this fight with you, and I think we're going to win this thing with God's help.
[02:55:17.970 --> 02:55:22.611]  And just in closing, I hope you will visit the online video and bookstore at Infowars.com.
[02:55:23.971 --> 02:55:24.972]  I hope you will support us.
[02:55:24.992 --> 02:55:26.552]  I hope you will get the videos and the books.
[02:55:26.632 --> 02:55:28.312]  I hope you'll make copies of the films I produce.
[02:55:28.332 --> 02:55:30.113]  I hope you'll get copies of the other films we carry.
[02:55:31.653 --> 02:55:34.474]  And get them out to people, and expose the murdering terrorists for who they are.
[02:55:34.774 --> 02:55:36.674]  They won't get away with it if you take action.
[02:55:37.333 --> 02:55:42.395]  None of us will save humanity by ourselves, but all of us moving forward, many hands make light work.
