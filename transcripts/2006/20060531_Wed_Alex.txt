[00:00:05.775 --> 00:00:06.380]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.077 --> 00:00:08.157]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.857 --> 00:00:09.998]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.598 --> 00:00:11.438]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.178 --> 00:00:13.079]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.739 --> 00:00:17.420]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:22.001]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:35.405 --> 00:00:36.748]  Yeah, I think.
[00:00:41.599 --> 00:00:43.439]  Welcome ladies and gentlemen, welcome.
[00:00:43.500 --> 00:01:09.646]  Thank you so much for joining us today on this live Wednesday edition, the 31st day of May 2006, the last day of this month as we plunge into June and our big 9-11 conference that's coming up June 24th and 25th in downtown Los Angeles with high-level senior CIA analyst Ray McGovern to Reagan and Bush senior
[00:01:10.606 --> 00:01:21.214]  BYU Physics Professor Stephen Jones, Dr. Stephen Jones, of course, Professor Jim Fetzer, author Webster Tarpley, and so many others.
[00:01:21.715 --> 00:01:24.317]  That is coming up June 24th and 25th.
[00:01:24.677 --> 00:01:35.966]  The tickets are going extremely fast right now, so I suggest that if you're planning to come to this conference or you've thought about it, make that decision quickly because they're going quick.
[00:01:36.026 --> 00:01:36.366]  Okay.
[00:01:37.747 --> 00:01:38.528]  Where to start?
[00:01:38.608 --> 00:01:39.689]  You know what I want to do today?
[00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:51.964]  It looks like we've got a state rep lined up from Wisconsin, maybe even the governor, where they passed the bill banning companies forcing their employees to take implantable microchips to have jobs.
[00:01:52.904 --> 00:01:59.066]  That's how far we've gotten into the police state in America that they're having to pass laws banning it.
[00:01:59.807 --> 00:02:03.868]  Do you understand, ladies and gentlemen, that this is very serious?
[00:02:04.468 --> 00:02:09.550]  And of course this happened because a Wisconsin security company was trying to make its employees take chips.
[00:02:10.473 --> 00:02:13.156]  They were trying to incentivize it, which is the same thing as forcing.
[00:02:13.236 --> 00:02:16.218]  Oh, you get more money, we trust you if you take a chip.
[00:02:16.719 --> 00:02:33.094]  Last year we had a Bergen County Sheriff on, to be technical, it's called a police chief there of the county, and he said that he's taken the chip, he wants his deputies to take it, and that he thinks we should all be made to take it, and he'd be happy to enforce that.
[00:02:33.692 --> 00:02:36.973]  We actually had the crazy man on the air.
[00:02:37.393 --> 00:02:40.154]  He works with Applied Digital Solutions and he openly said that.
[00:02:41.414 --> 00:02:42.515]  But that's a side issue.
[00:02:42.555 --> 00:02:43.675]  I thought I'd just mention that.
[00:02:43.775 --> 00:02:46.496]  Other than that, I just want to have open phones today.
[00:02:47.796 --> 00:02:54.078]  I really want to take your calls and I really want to just talk about whatever issue you want to discuss.
[00:02:54.118 --> 00:02:59.720]  The main thing I hope you'll want to talk about is the fact that we're hurtling towards World War III.
[00:03:01.508 --> 00:03:04.314]  We had Ray McGovern on with us on Monday.
[00:03:04.395 --> 00:03:11.710]  He went further than he's ever gone, saying clearly our government's behind much of the terror, clearly elements of our government or private intel groups.
[00:03:13.066 --> 00:03:15.147]  May carry out massive terror attacks.
[00:03:15.187 --> 00:03:17.569]  He said it's a probability in the U.S.
[00:03:17.689 --> 00:03:23.172]  or in the Western world, Western Europe, England, as a pretext to blame Iran.
[00:03:23.352 --> 00:03:27.394]  He said he believes the neocons will attack Iran, a very good chance.
[00:03:27.414 --> 00:03:28.355]  He says he believes they will.
[00:03:28.675 --> 00:03:34.398]  He has predicted that, barring a miracle, barring the people rising up and saying, no, that may still happen.
[00:03:34.778 --> 00:03:36.739]  Then if it does happen, it'll be a blessing.
[00:03:36.779 --> 00:03:39.561]  People will say, Ray McGovern said we were going to go to war.
[00:03:40.382 --> 00:03:41.002]  Why we didn't?
[00:03:41.063 --> 00:03:41.683]  He's wrong.
[00:03:41.723 --> 00:03:43.884]  Well, he says there's a small chance we can stop it.
[00:03:44.765 --> 00:03:48.067]  And let's hope he's wrong, but he hasn't been wrong very often.
[00:03:48.107 --> 00:03:50.849]  In fact, I haven't found him being wrong in the past.
[00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:56.073]  That's why he was a chief analyst for Ronald Reagan and George Bush, Sr.
[00:03:56.713 --> 00:04:06.080]  And it looks like they're going to be attacking anywhere this summer or this fall, as early as late June, as late as October.
[00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:08.761]  And we're facing World War III.
[00:04:08.801 --> 00:04:13.683]  I don't know if some of you out there realize the consequences of striking Iran.
[00:04:14.123 --> 00:04:15.164]  But they are legion.
[00:04:15.204 --> 00:04:16.685]  They are manifestly bad.
[00:04:16.705 --> 00:04:23.408]  And even Jack Straw, the Foreign Secretary, criticized this and said it was crazy to attack.
[00:04:23.448 --> 00:04:24.469]  He's a big neocon.
[00:04:25.069 --> 00:04:26.630]  And he had to resign two days later.
[00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:27.610]  They forced him out.
[00:04:28.631 --> 00:04:29.431]  This is nuts.
[00:04:29.791 --> 00:04:32.152]  A bunch of conservative generals have gone public.
[00:04:33.933 --> 00:04:35.654]  We've got another general joining us tomorrow.
[00:04:37.066 --> 00:04:39.989]  So, I want to talk about 1-800-259-9231.
[00:04:40.509 --> 00:04:49.138]  You can bring up whatever you want, but expect to be on about 45 seconds if it's another issue.
[00:04:49.238 --> 00:04:52.221]  If it's Iran, you can go 5 minutes if you've got good points to make.
[00:04:52.241 --> 00:04:52.781]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:04:52.801 --> 00:04:54.883]  InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, PrisonPlanet.tv are the websites.
[00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:09.668]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here and I'm excited to announce we're going to have a huge 9-11 conference in downtown Los Angeles on the 24th and 25th of June.
[00:05:09.868 --> 00:05:12.211]  We're expecting around a thousand people in attendance.
[00:05:12.811 --> 00:05:21.660]  At this historic event, we will irrefutably document that 9-11 was an inside job, a self-inflicted wound, a false flag terror operation.
[00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:25.703]  The conference is titled 9-11 and the Neocon Agenda.
[00:05:26.143 --> 00:05:46.961]  I'm happy to announce the conference will feature presentations by incredible speakers like BYU physics professor Stephen Jones, the father of the Star Wars program, Lieutenant Colonel Robert Bowman, former top-level CIA analyst for Reagan and Bush, Ray McGovern, 9-11 hero William Rodriguez, author Webster Charnley, Professor Jim Fetzer, and many, many others, including special guests.
[00:05:47.261 --> 00:05:51.004]  I'll also be debuting my explosive new film, Terror Storm, at the conference.
[00:05:51.784 --> 00:06:04.189]  The War on Terrorism.
[00:06:04.509 --> 00:06:07.291]  Will it be fought overseas, or will it affect us here at home?
[00:06:07.571 --> 00:06:11.712]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[00:06:12.153 --> 00:06:12.973]  So what do you do?
[00:06:13.293 --> 00:06:17.855]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[00:06:18.345 --> 00:06:20.465]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[00:06:20.966 --> 00:06:35.649]  Sheltering in Place, Surviving Acts of Terrorism from Biological, Chemical, and Radioactive Fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:06:35.689 --> 00:06:42.830]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:46.271]  Get this critical video every American needs for only $29 plus shipping.

[00:07:01.238 --> 00:07:07.563]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[00:07:07.923 --> 00:07:12.627]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Wright Frequency Technology.
[00:07:12.947 --> 00:07:20.573]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Wright discovered that disease organisms could be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:07:20.893 --> 00:07:27.739]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:07:27.959 --> 00:07:29.340]  There are no side effects!
[00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:33.301]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[00:07:33.582 --> 00:07:40.644]  BioSolutions has over 550 programmed auto sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.

[00:07:54.089 --> 00:07:55.151]  Once again, that's 866-885-6625.
[00:08:06.015 --> 00:08:06.655]  Big Brother.
[00:08:07.316 --> 00:08:08.376]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:09.096 --> 00:08:10.216]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:10.856 --> 00:08:11.676]  You want answers?
[00:08:12.417 --> 00:08:13.937]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:13.997 --> 00:08:17.938]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:18.178 --> 00:08:22.239]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:34.055 --> 00:08:58.969]  I want to talk about World War 3, or what the CIA calls World War 4, the upcoming, rapidly accelerating towards us, collision, crashing bombardment of Iran, and what that means to the geopolitical structure, what that means to the dollar, what that means to all of us on this planet, especially Americans and Iranians.
[00:09:00.603 --> 00:09:05.268]  Now I have other little stories here like one in three Americans now has diabetes.
[00:09:05.929 --> 00:09:07.331]  This is out of Reuters Health.
[00:09:07.531 --> 00:09:12.477]  More than one out of every three individuals in the United States have diabetes and another 26% have impaired
[00:09:15.074 --> 00:09:19.015]  Fasting Glycose, which increases the risk of developing diabetes.
[00:09:19.075 --> 00:09:29.939]  New study findings suggest the prevalence of diagnosed diabetes has increased in recent years, while undiagnosed diabetes and impaired fasting glucose has remained constant over the past decade.
[00:09:29.959 --> 00:09:35.161]  Reuters reports more than one out of every three individuals in the United States have diabetes.
[00:09:35.181 --> 00:09:37.382]  Another 26% have impaired fasting glycose.
[00:09:38.015 --> 00:09:40.118]  I don't know why the Reuters article repeats that twice but c'est la vie.
[00:09:56.707 --> 00:10:09.890]  A counterbalance of fewer people with undiagnosed diabetes, study co-author Dr. Katherine C. Coey of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases in Bethesda told Reuters Health.
[00:10:10.390 --> 00:10:16.831]  The findings are based on an analysis of four years of data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.
[00:10:16.891 --> 00:10:21.472]  The study included information on 4,761 adults ages 20 years or older who have classified according to their
[00:10:25.911 --> 00:10:26.271]  Thank you.
[00:10:56.191 --> 00:11:03.597]  However, the prevalence of diagnosed diabetes rose 5.1 percent from 88 to 94 to 6.5 and 99 to 2002.
[00:11:03.678 --> 00:11:08.341]  They are estimated that about one-third of diabetics are undiagnosed.
[00:11:09.923 --> 00:11:14.667]  So, I'll talk about this first, then we're going to get into World War III and have open phones throughout the broadcast.
[00:11:17.449 --> 00:11:18.290]  What's going on here?
[00:11:19.211 --> 00:11:22.033]  Well, I've interviewed top genetic engineering specialists
[00:11:22.802 --> 00:11:25.704]  We've interviewed experts, doctors on diabetes.
[00:11:27.004 --> 00:11:31.567]  Juvenile diabetes is up several thousand percentage points every five years.
[00:11:33.128 --> 00:11:37.390]  Here is the national study put on with government funding.
[00:11:37.450 --> 00:11:49.217]  It mirrors other studies that I have been reading in the last few years that one in three Americans now has some type of diabetes.
[00:11:50.577 --> 00:11:51.258]  Why is this?
[00:11:52.961 --> 00:12:13.349]  Well, there are legions of reports confirming that corn syrup, extracted from corn, is a very destructive form of sugar and makes the entire system dealing with the pancreas go haywire.
[00:12:15.050 --> 00:12:16.470]  And that it's very, very dangerous.
[00:12:16.570 --> 00:12:20.892]  So just continue to drink your Cokes, continue to eat your white bread,
[00:12:22.314 --> 00:12:27.416]  I mean, almost everything I read out there that's a processed food has this corn syrup in it.
[00:12:28.577 --> 00:12:29.297]  Very, very bad.
[00:12:30.238 --> 00:12:31.398]  Then there's something even worse.
[00:12:31.578 --> 00:12:37.241]  There are several big studies out showing that people that drink diet drinks are at even higher risk of diabetes.
[00:12:37.261 --> 00:12:38.301]  And you say, why is that?
[00:12:38.361 --> 00:12:49.246]  Well, the wood alcohol is poisonous, and the body also recognizes that as a sugar, and that really throws it into a fit.
[00:12:50.405 --> 00:12:54.908]  Americans in modern times, last hundred years, have all consumed a lot of sugar.
[00:12:58.250 --> 00:12:59.871]  Why is this just now happening?
[00:13:00.952 --> 00:13:16.482]  Well, it's not just the corn syrup, and it's not just the lack of exercise, which then heats the body up, causes the blood to flow, causes the body to metabolize fat, which is a wonderful engine of supplying energy.
[00:13:17.123 --> 00:13:18.724]  It's delivered in a slow,
[00:13:20.377 --> 00:13:22.318]  I'm putting this all in layman's terms.
[00:13:22.358 --> 00:13:27.779]  I've read literally hundreds of medical reports on this and so it is destructive to the pancreas.
[00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:37.902]  But people don't exercise enough now and then they add all of this processed sugar into their diet and it's destructive.
[00:13:37.982 --> 00:13:41.843]  But what is the main causal indicator in all of this?
[00:13:41.983 --> 00:13:45.284]  It is genetically modified engineered foods.
[00:13:45.364 --> 00:13:45.704]  You see,
[00:13:47.003 --> 00:13:55.400]  There are what, 50-something naturally occurring amino acids that you find in eggs, and milk, and poultry, and fish, and beef, and pork.
[00:13:56.716 --> 00:14:03.059]  And you find some of those amino acids, some foods like milk, I believe, has all of the amino acids in it.
[00:14:03.219 --> 00:14:04.460]  Eggs has almost all of them.
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:06.101]  Beef has most of them.
[00:14:06.981 --> 00:14:13.665]  Soybeans and then corn and other things will have a few of the amino acids, but not a complete amino acid.
[00:14:13.685 --> 00:14:16.566]  That's why vegetarians will eat beans and rice together.
[00:14:16.846 --> 00:14:21.629]  Those two will supposedly give you a complete amino acid spectrum.
[00:14:22.429 --> 00:14:26.231]  And you can build and also get the protein that you need from that.
[00:14:28.152 --> 00:14:33.155]  But what happens is most rice species that we now consume are genetically engineered.
[00:14:33.876 --> 00:14:39.220]  Most bean species that we consume are genetically engineered.
[00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:48.406]  Many of the fish and poultry and porcine pig meat that we eat has been engineered.
[00:14:49.856 --> 00:15:00.183]  And, well, there was a study a few years ago that, what was it, 90-something percent, I forget the exact number, of corn species have been infected by cross-species chimera.
[00:15:01.024 --> 00:15:07.608]  And chimera, of course, was the Greek god that, depending on which manifestation, had two to six heads.
[00:15:08.308 --> 00:15:13.432]  It might be an eagle and a lion, it might be a snake and a goat,
[00:15:14.455 --> 00:15:22.484]  The point is that they call these scientifically chimeras, from the Greek term chimera, and that is a cross species.
[00:15:22.744 --> 00:15:25.507]  And Limbaugh and others, I've heard them many times, they have talking points.
[00:15:25.547 --> 00:15:29.151]  They go, this genetic engineering is totally natural, it's not a problem.
[00:15:31.113 --> 00:15:32.775]  Why George Washington Carver?
[00:15:35.356 --> 00:15:42.123]  Had hybrids, well yes, he would take peanuts and cross them with other peanuts and that naturally happens.
[00:15:42.143 --> 00:15:44.185]  He would take different corn and cross it with other corn.
[00:15:44.485 --> 00:15:47.608]  That is still the same basic species line.
[00:15:48.551 --> 00:15:54.274]  And so it's not really genetic engineering in the modern sense.
[00:15:54.394 --> 00:15:54.594]  No.
[00:15:55.094 --> 00:16:00.116]  When you take, and it's mainly insects they use because their genetic code is very easily spliced.
[00:16:00.436 --> 00:16:02.197]  It's pretty hard with mammals and plants.
[00:16:02.778 --> 00:16:04.018]  Mammals and mammals is easy.
[00:16:04.058 --> 00:16:06.879]  But for some reason, they've used thousands of insects.
[00:16:06.939 --> 00:16:07.960]  It's thousands and thousands.
[00:16:08.849 --> 00:16:10.790]  And one of their favorites is the cockroach.
[00:16:10.950 --> 00:16:12.351]  Very old genetic line.
[00:16:12.391 --> 00:16:13.551]  Very easy to splice in.
[00:16:13.872 --> 00:16:15.652]  The grasshopper is in hundreds of foods.
[00:16:16.093 --> 00:16:19.514]  Most tomatoes, now that are genetically modified, have cockroach genes in them.
[00:16:20.155 --> 00:16:22.636]  And we've had top scientists on who worked on this.
[00:16:22.996 --> 00:16:29.499]  They don't know why it works, but a tomato lasts three or four times longer if you've got several delicious cockroach genes in it.
[00:16:30.672 --> 00:16:37.154]  Salmon genes in corn, corn genes in spiders, that they then cross with goats.
[00:16:37.214 --> 00:16:44.737]  So in some cases, I had a top scientist on last year, a Nobel Prize winner, and I said, so you'll have two or three species.
[00:16:44.777 --> 00:16:47.237]  He said, Alex, it's not two or three species.
[00:16:47.277 --> 00:16:51.959]  We might have 20 species in a, say, potato.
[00:16:53.159 --> 00:16:58.321]  Animal, plant, bacteria, they're injecting viruses into it.
[00:16:59.476 --> 00:17:01.497]  And they can change one thing.
[00:17:01.537 --> 00:17:07.498]  They can make the potato last longer, but then it changes randomly thousands of other things.
[00:17:07.598 --> 00:17:08.679]  So it's Russian roulette.
[00:17:09.039 --> 00:17:10.999]  It's all approved here in the US.
[00:17:11.099 --> 00:17:12.320]  Europe won't accept most of it.
[00:17:13.180 --> 00:17:16.021]  And you eat this, and it creates new amino acids.
[00:17:16.101 --> 00:17:17.541]  Hundreds of new amino acids.
[00:17:17.901 --> 00:17:20.162]  Thousands of new crystalline ring structures.
[00:17:21.102 --> 00:17:22.762]  Thousands of new enzymes.
[00:17:23.463 --> 00:17:24.803]  And that goes into your body.
[00:17:25.891 --> 00:17:31.059]  And in no time in human experience have we ever been designed to absorb this.
[00:17:31.399 --> 00:17:35.545]  Your body doesn't know what it is and cannot metabolize it.
[00:17:36.487 --> 00:17:38.069]  It's the equivalent of eating plastic.
[00:17:38.830 --> 00:17:39.191]  It's poison.
[00:17:41.915 --> 00:17:53.299]  And in every case, they feed chimera, potatoes, corn, soybeans, to rats, to mice, laboratory animals, to guinea pigs, to rabbits, and in most cases, about half of them die, depending on the study.
[00:17:54.019 --> 00:17:56.180]  You feed them to baby animals, they die.
[00:17:57.480 --> 00:18:07.644]  They actually have mutations within the already fully developed... You know, normally mutations occur in the zygote or occur in the embryonic early stages.
[00:18:08.164 --> 00:18:08.304]  No.
[00:18:09.335 --> 00:18:09.715]  No, no, no.
[00:18:09.735 --> 00:18:15.961]  They've actually found with genetically modified food that you get mutations which is really unknown.
[00:18:16.982 --> 00:18:26.970]  You get mutations like in some Hollywood nightmare science fiction movie in the already developed, already gestated, already born mammal.
[00:18:28.343 --> 00:18:29.263]  Isn't that special?
[00:18:29.764 --> 00:18:40.367]  Tumors, the intestines for some reason will double in size, the equivalent of Crohn's, accelerated autoimmune disease, and of course Crohn's disease is of course exploding nationwide.
[00:18:40.687 --> 00:18:42.028]  They thought it was genetic, it really isn't.
[00:18:43.228 --> 00:18:50.370]  On and on and on and on, it totally fries your pancreas, it fries your organs, and I'm eating it, you're eating it, it's everywhere.
[00:18:50.390 --> 00:18:51.511]  I try to eat mainly organic.
[00:18:51.811 --> 00:18:55.352]  My children probably eat 90% organic, I probably eat half organic because I'm so busy.
[00:18:56.070 --> 00:19:04.754]  And it's killing us, and I would imagine if one in three has diabetes, at the current trends, what, in about ten years, two out of three will have it, and I'm sure pretty soon we'll all have it!
[00:19:05.735 --> 00:19:15.519]  Dick Cheney feeds it to his kids, I feed it to mine, you feed it to, you know, Bill Clinton gives it to his, eats it himself, and this is happening, and this is just the new America, folks!
[00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:17.060]  This is the new world!
[00:19:18.521 --> 00:19:20.522]  The new world order comes to kill, steal, and destroy,
[00:19:21.650 --> 00:19:25.352]  So, uh, we were eating corn syrup 50 years ago and didn't see this growth in diabetes.
[00:19:25.372 --> 00:19:26.953]  We were eating corn syrup 80 years ago.
[00:19:27.714 --> 00:19:29.535]  The corn syrup is the red herring.
[00:19:29.695 --> 00:19:30.415]  It's the scapegoat.
[00:19:30.475 --> 00:19:31.236]  It's not good for you.
[00:19:31.916 --> 00:19:37.740]  But compared to cockroach genes, and cockroach, uh, well these aren't even cockroach amino acids.
[00:19:37.780 --> 00:19:39.101]  These are amino acids that didn't exist.
[00:19:39.501 --> 00:19:41.162]  The cockroach has the same amino acids we have.
[00:19:41.482 --> 00:19:43.043]  We could actually eat cockroaches all day.
[00:19:43.403 --> 00:19:44.584]  Except they've spliced them.
[00:19:45.453 --> 00:19:48.357]  It's new stuff.
[00:19:48.437 --> 00:19:52.142]  It just never existed before in any of the biosphere of this planet.
[00:19:54.405 --> 00:19:59.092]  You know, they've got these... I'll break it down when we get back, and then we'll get into World War III and take your calls.
[00:20:01.727 --> 00:20:03.308]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:20:03.688 --> 00:20:09.432]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[00:20:09.692 --> 00:20:14.816]  The Berkey Light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[00:20:15.176 --> 00:20:24.442]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, trihalomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.
[00:20:24.802 --> 00:20:29.765]  It's rechargeable 8-lamp bright white LED lighting system provides the ideal source of emergency light.
[00:20:30.065 --> 00:20:34.087]  The lights can run all night on a single charge and it is bright enough to read by.
[00:20:34.287 --> 00:20:39.049]  This provides a relaxing and ambient night light and allows for optimum use during emergency conditions.
[00:20:39.409 --> 00:20:45.352]  The Berkey Light's revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.
[00:20:45.673 --> 00:20:46.553]  Get the Berkey Light!
[00:20:46.653 --> 00:20:54.695]  The standard of excellence for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:20:54.895 --> 00:20:56.955]  That's toll free at 888-803-4438.
[00:20:57.096 --> 00:21:00.076]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:21:07.538 --> 00:21:09.619]  Currency devaluation, inflation.
[00:21:10.099 --> 00:21:10.799]  One and the same.
[00:21:11.519 --> 00:21:12.859]  If you had deposited $100,000 in a bank at 1%
[00:21:15.894 --> 00:21:21.356]  In a 30-month period dating from May 24, 2005, here is what happened to your funds.
[00:21:21.777 --> 00:21:24.898]  The dollar lost 33% of its value in that time frame.
[00:21:25.178 --> 00:21:26.999]  The bank paid you 1%.
[00:21:27.059 --> 00:21:30.080]  Your $100,000 now has a net purchasing power of $68,000.
[00:21:30.621 --> 00:21:32.841]  Here is reality.
[00:21:33.222 --> 00:21:36.803]  The devaluation of currency equals real inflation.
[00:21:37.283 --> 00:21:40.945]  Keep in mind how the value of your paper assets are measured in dollars.
[00:21:41.505 --> 00:21:44.086]  Gold, in the same time frame, increased 35% in value.
[00:21:45.706 --> 00:21:49.388]  Learn how to protect and profit in this truly unstable world economy.
[00:21:49.748 --> 00:21:51.389]  Call Midas Resources at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:51.690 --> 00:21:55.812]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:57.053 --> 00:22:07.839]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism, but globalism.
[00:22:08.399 --> 00:22:09.360]  Globalists are concerned
[00:22:13.851 --> 00:22:14.111]  We're good.
[00:22:39.445 --> 00:22:39.625]  Thank you.
[00:23:02.341 --> 00:23:04.703]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here with an important question.
[00:23:04.923 --> 00:23:06.965]  What was the last time you used pure soap?
[00:23:07.105 --> 00:23:14.170]  I mean real hard to find all natural pure soap that contains no dyes, perfumes, deodorants, detergents, or other dangerous toxins.
[00:23:14.430 --> 00:23:23.017]  The Calvin Pure Soap Company, for the past 57 years, has been making triple concentrated pure soaps exclusively for healthcare professionals and hospitals.
[00:23:23.097 --> 00:23:23.317]  Yes!
[00:23:23.337 --> 00:23:28.020]  Now for the first time, Calvin Pure Soap is available factory direct to you and your family.
[00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:34.844]  That's great news because Calvin Pure Soap is made from all natural ingredients, is earth friendly, and completely environmentally safe.

[00:23:57.174 --> 00:24:00.395]  Try Pure Soap once and I'll guarantee you'll never use anything else.
[00:24:08.718 --> 00:24:12.320]  Let me draw a parallel to the genetic engineering and
[00:24:14.329 --> 00:24:17.211]  Human allergies have now increased many, many fold.
[00:24:17.291 --> 00:24:26.318]  That's directly linked to food allergies with the genetic engineered food products, which have now proliferated the entire food chain of the human population.
[00:24:27.419 --> 00:24:29.080]  And some of the other things that are happening.
[00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:31.942]  Depleted uranium has been used in 10 sites in the U.S.
[00:24:31.982 --> 00:24:37.686]  by the ton, by the thousands of tons in Iraq twice, in Afghanistan, in the Balkans several times.
[00:24:38.427 --> 00:24:42.750]  The birth defects there, depending on the country, have tripled or in some cases quadrupled.
[00:24:43.644 --> 00:24:46.868]  That is official numbers, but the elite still does this.
[00:24:46.908 --> 00:24:48.410]  They put aspartame in your drinks.
[00:24:48.771 --> 00:24:52.596]  They put genetically engineered products into your food.
[00:24:53.096 --> 00:24:59.845]  They do all of this very destructive, devilish type activities.
[00:25:00.206 --> 00:25:01.808]  And go back 20 plus years ago,
[00:25:03.526 --> 00:25:16.472]  DARPA and other big government research firms created several big devices, and they have different names, but basically they run trillions of volts, basically, through already existing matter.
[00:25:16.532 --> 00:25:23.995]  And I'm sure you've heard that they have the periodic table with the known elements here on planet Earth, and they haven't found any other elements on the moon.
[00:25:24.715 --> 00:25:29.197]  Well, they've created, I forget, it's 50 plus new elements.
[00:25:30.280 --> 00:25:55.469]  And it'll take the amount of power, on average, that it takes to run Manhattan for a couple weeks, but they run all this power in one big pulse, and they have these focused, I guess you could call them magnetic fields, these shields, and it's all part of fission fusion, and they're able to create artificial matter, new matter, some of it quite unstable.
[00:25:56.238 --> 00:26:01.180]  If you don't believe me, folks, just type in scientists create new elements and articles will pop up about it.
[00:26:01.461 --> 00:26:03.722]  Well, that's what they've done with genetic engineering.
[00:26:03.762 --> 00:26:04.482]  It's much easier.
[00:26:04.982 --> 00:26:17.348]  They take a bunch of species, they manipulate them, they cross their genetics and it creates new life matter, new codes, new combinations that are unknown.
[00:26:18.049 --> 00:26:23.011]  It's so destructive and then they approve it and we eat it.
[00:26:23.877 --> 00:26:26.498]  We feed it to our children because it looks like good food.
[00:26:26.538 --> 00:26:27.418]  It tastes like good food.
[00:26:27.738 --> 00:26:30.819]  But they've taken a lot of genetically altered foods and tried to feed it to cows.
[00:26:31.319 --> 00:26:32.219]  Tried to feed it to horses.
[00:26:32.259 --> 00:26:33.219]  Tried to feed it to pigs.
[00:26:33.799 --> 00:26:36.760]  And the pigs especially, because they've got a better nose than a dog.
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:39.901]  Pigs especially will not eat it.
[00:26:40.701 --> 00:26:43.802]  They will not eat some of these genetically modified soybeans.
[00:26:44.162 --> 00:26:46.382]  They will not eat some of these chimera corns.
[00:26:46.862 --> 00:26:48.403]  They just will walk away from it.
[00:26:48.803 --> 00:26:50.443]  What does a pig smell?
[00:26:51.223 --> 00:26:52.464]  A greedy pig, folks.
[00:26:52.504 --> 00:26:53.284]  Pigs will eat anything.
[00:26:53.837 --> 00:26:56.478]  For those that don't know, that's why they call them a truffle hound.
[00:26:56.838 --> 00:26:58.919]  They use pigs to go out and find truffles.
[00:26:58.939 --> 00:27:02.260]  They have noses that make a blood hound pale in significance.
[00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:02.821]  Literally.
[00:27:03.301 --> 00:27:08.383]  They're trying to train pigs as bomb sniffers, but they're pretty honored.
[00:27:08.403 --> 00:27:09.083]  They're not like a dog.
[00:27:09.103 --> 00:27:09.803]  They're hard to train.
[00:27:10.183 --> 00:27:10.944]  Side issue.
[00:27:11.504 --> 00:27:14.205]  Pigs, especially, will not eat this stuff.
[00:27:14.485 --> 00:27:15.746]  But you're going to feed it to your kids.
[00:27:15.806 --> 00:27:16.726]  It's like the cell phones.
[00:27:17.387 --> 00:27:24.250]  New studies every day coming out, big governmental studies, university studies, that is giving us brain tumors, that it heats the brain.
[00:27:24.510 --> 00:27:25.771]  It's microwave energy.
[00:27:26.291 --> 00:27:27.152]  I still use them.
[00:27:27.292 --> 00:27:36.836]  I still, every few months, lose the cord that goes to it, and then there'll be a few months I forget to go buy another one, where I get sick of it, and I'm in a hurry, and I just can't pick it up, you know, because the phone's ringing.
[00:27:36.856 --> 00:27:42.399]  I get to it on the fifth ring when it's about to pick up, and it isn't plugged in, or I just pull the bottom out and put it up to my head.
[00:27:44.016 --> 00:27:48.419]  My children see this and they're going to end up wanting cell phones because we're a mammalian species.
[00:27:49.280 --> 00:27:50.801]  We do what our elders do.
[00:27:50.841 --> 00:27:52.022]  We do what our idols do.
[00:27:52.062 --> 00:27:53.403]  We do what those we respect do.
[00:27:53.443 --> 00:27:54.124]  We emulate.
[00:27:54.364 --> 00:27:55.645]  We model off of others.
[00:27:56.285 --> 00:28:00.609]  We're all killing ourselves and we don't have the self-control to stop it.
[00:28:01.329 --> 00:28:04.011]  It's like the water's full of stannous and sodium fluoride.
[00:28:04.351 --> 00:28:05.112]  Deadly poison.
[00:28:05.172 --> 00:28:07.514]  Thousands of university studies worldwide.
[00:28:08.357 --> 00:28:09.138]  We still drink it.
[00:28:09.518 --> 00:28:12.820]  Dead bacteria, chlorine, herbicides, pesticides.
[00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:14.522]  I at least don't do that.
[00:28:15.662 --> 00:28:18.104]  I mean, I shouldn't even go in a restaurant and drink iced tea, folks.
[00:28:18.144 --> 00:28:19.565]  The water is that poisonous.
[00:28:19.965 --> 00:28:22.507]  It's at every level we're being poisoned.
[00:28:22.868 --> 00:28:26.870]  Is there any surprise that cancer has doubled in the last ten years?
[00:28:26.950 --> 00:28:28.592]  Yes, the national cancer rate.
[00:28:28.952 --> 00:28:30.953]  Breast cancer is up over six times.
[00:28:31.974 --> 00:28:33.715]  Everybody I know is getting breast cancer.
[00:28:33.775 --> 00:28:34.676]  I don't like this.
[00:28:35.056 --> 00:28:37.258]  I love these women I know that are getting breast cancer.
[00:28:38.214 --> 00:28:39.875]  Friends and grandmothers and others.
[00:28:40.516 --> 00:28:42.718]  I'm in dread that my wife someday might get it.
[00:28:44.780 --> 00:28:58.852]  And it's the genetically engineered hormones, that's right, they're engineered themselves, in the milk, it's in the cheeses, it's in the water, it's in the plastics, the dioxin that is a toxic
[00:28:59.858 --> 00:29:01.559]  It fools the body into thinking it's estrogen.
[00:29:02.100 --> 00:29:05.642]  Our boys are effeminate because they drink out of plastic bottles.
[00:29:05.682 --> 00:29:06.643]  That's admitted.
[00:29:06.663 --> 00:29:09.184]  I mean, it's poison everywhere!
[00:29:10.725 --> 00:29:14.207]  Our girls develop at age 9 instead of 12 like they're supposed to.
[00:29:14.548 --> 00:29:17.530]  They're getting all... It's a cocktail.
[00:29:18.050 --> 00:29:20.992]  A cocktail of poisons and toxins and garbage.
[00:29:21.452 --> 00:29:23.814]  We've got to get a hold of this now.
[00:29:24.714 --> 00:29:25.855]  This isn't hype, folks.
[00:29:25.975 --> 00:29:27.056]  Look at the numbers.
[00:29:27.777 --> 00:29:30.257]  How many toddlers do you know that are getting leukemia?
[00:29:31.358 --> 00:29:32.238]  I know a lot of them!
[00:29:33.658 --> 00:29:35.638]  How many women do you know have breast cancer?
[00:29:35.818 --> 00:29:38.199]  How many people do you know that have diabetes?
[00:29:39.279 --> 00:29:41.480]  They're chopping arms and legs off left and right!
[00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:45.740]  It's the genetically engineered food, number one!
[00:29:46.580 --> 00:29:48.581]  We'll come back in the World War III, take your calls.
[00:29:51.941 --> 00:29:54.842]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.875 --> 00:29:58.549]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.798 --> 00:30:07.782]  I used to be ashamed of my toenails, so I thought I was destined to wear tennis shoes through the heat of the summer and hide my toes at the beach.
[00:30:08.202 --> 00:30:10.864]  And then my podiatrist told me about Non-X Nail Gel.
[00:30:11.024 --> 00:30:15.647]  It tackles unsightly nails by clearing out the cause of the problem, yellowing keratin debris buildup.
[00:30:15.807 --> 00:30:20.611]  With regular use, Non-X Gel breaks down and removes the debris, so toenails look clear.
[00:30:20.811 --> 00:30:25.534]  This summer I'm wearing open-toed sandals again, thanks to a topical natural gel called Non-X.
[00:30:25.754 --> 00:30:28.436]  If your toenails are embarrassing, I recommend Non-X Nail Gel.
[00:30:28.656 --> 00:30:31.558]  It's at your pharmacy or mass retailer in the foot care section.
[00:30:32.839 --> 00:30:33.859]  Looking for profits?
[00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:35.300]  Looking for safety and security?
[00:30:35.761 --> 00:30:38.843]  The $10 Olympic commemorative gold coin offers both.
[00:30:38.903 --> 00:30:46.468]  This low mintage collector coin with a total series mintage under $600,000 has sold at four times its current price.
[00:30:46.528 --> 00:30:50.071]  Falling dollar values and inflation make this likely to happen again.
[00:30:50.291 --> 00:30:51.792]  Secure your position today.
[00:30:52.112 --> 00:30:53.293]  Call Midas Resources at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:30:53.373 --> 00:30:53.613]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:31:02.052 --> 00:31:05.614]  Do you know where the 78 potentially active volcanoes in the U.S.
[00:31:05.654 --> 00:31:06.154]  are located?
[00:31:06.374 --> 00:31:09.756]  And do you know the locations of the top 300 prime terrorist targets?
[00:31:09.976 --> 00:31:14.698]  You can find these answers and more in the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA.
[00:31:14.958 --> 00:31:19.960]  With the more than 50 interactive parameters, you can pinpoint natural and man-made disaster areas.
[00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:20.820]  We're good to go.
[00:31:39.392 --> 00:31:39.812]  I think so.
[00:32:02.048 --> 00:32:08.912]  For months now, you've been hearing about the incredible health benefits of Zango, the functional health beverage made from the whole fruit of mangosteen.
[00:32:09.072 --> 00:32:22.000]  What you probably didn't know is that Zango joined forces with the leading manufacturer and distributor of functional health beverages like Capri Sun, Sobe, Mystic, and Red Bull to create the fastest growing business opportunity in America today.
[00:32:22.180 --> 00:32:23.961]  Are you sick of barely having enough money?
[00:32:24.121 --> 00:32:27.603]  Are you tired of working so hard yet feeling like you'll never get ahead?
[00:32:27.884 --> 00:32:31.666]  Are you ready to start investing in your own business instead of somebody else's?
[00:32:31.926 --> 00:32:36.890]  Whatever it is you seek, Dangle could be the special company that helps you achieve your hopes and dreams.
[00:32:37.150 --> 00:32:38.871]  So take matters into your own hands.
[00:32:39.131 --> 00:32:43.114]  Create a future that doesn't depend on a fickle 401k and lateral promotions.
[00:32:43.354 --> 00:32:45.216]  Dango is what you are looking for.
[00:32:45.356 --> 00:32:50.000]  Find out more by calling 888-203-6633 or visit MangosteenMarket.com.
[00:32:50.020 --> 00:32:51.722]  That's M-A-N-G-O-S-T-E-E-N Market.com.
[00:32:51.782 --> 00:32:52.363]  Call 888-203-6633 today.
[00:32:52.383 --> 00:32:54.485]  We don't need no education.
[00:33:12.153 --> 00:33:19.516]  Maury, Joe, Bart, Luis, Beth, everybody, your calls are coming up here in about four and a half minutes.
[00:33:19.536 --> 00:33:29.680]  I'm just going to take your calls and then I'll go into a full analysis of the Iran situation according to top CIA analyst Ray McGovern who gave us the analysis Monday.
[00:33:30.020 --> 00:33:32.301]  I'll integrate that with my take on it.
[00:33:33.582 --> 00:33:36.743]  The most dangerous time in modern human history right now.
[00:33:37.458 --> 00:33:40.020]  What's about to happen dwarfs the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1961.
[00:33:40.140 --> 00:33:43.903]  It dwarfs the global danger of World War II.
[00:33:43.963 --> 00:33:44.743]  I'm not kidding.
[00:33:45.244 --> 00:33:46.124]  We'll break that down.
[00:33:46.665 --> 00:33:50.308]  Before we do that, I was just talking about the poisons in the water, the poisons in the air.
[00:33:50.668 --> 00:33:56.192]  More than just poisons, genetically engineered foods that are just wrecking our health.
[00:33:56.973 --> 00:33:58.173]  That are pure poison.
[00:33:58.213 --> 00:34:01.476]  I mean, again, I've had Nobel Prize winners, top scientists, top engineers.
[00:34:02.265 --> 00:34:10.497]  Genetic engineers on here, who work for these companies, and half the rats would die when they feed them this, and they'd go, you can't approve this, and they'd say, yes we are!
[00:34:12.220 --> 00:34:18.028]  Speaking of the devil, the water supply is just unbelievable.
[00:34:18.789 --> 00:34:25.031]  I mean, if you're drinking off a well, that's pretty good, but still there's so much leached into the water supply that that's not even very safe.
[00:34:25.051 --> 00:34:26.292]  You've got to filter your water.
[00:34:26.592 --> 00:34:27.292]  We do this here.
[00:34:27.332 --> 00:34:29.233]  We have a big Berkey at the office, a big Berkey at home.
[00:34:30.153 --> 00:34:35.075]  Every Christmas, I probably buy, I counted it up, I think I bought seven of these last year.
[00:34:35.095 --> 00:34:36.895]  I've already bought three this year.
[00:34:37.476 --> 00:34:39.236]  This is what I give to people I love.
[00:34:40.117 --> 00:34:41.057]  This is what I give.
[00:34:41.858 --> 00:34:43.940]  And the hurricane season is coming up.
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:45.862]  I mean, if that's a reason to get you moving, fine.
[00:34:46.182 --> 00:34:47.683]  They're saying a record hurricane season.
[00:34:47.723 --> 00:34:48.624]  Don't wait this time.
[00:34:49.004 --> 00:34:53.468]  Last year, they sold out for a few weeks until the factory that's here in the U.S.
[00:34:53.508 --> 00:34:54.189]  could make more.
[00:34:54.529 --> 00:34:55.970]  It's made in America.
[00:34:57.432 --> 00:34:59.914]  You're getting what distributors get.
[00:34:59.934 --> 00:35:02.696]  I mean, these are $300 at the camping supply store.
[00:35:02.716 --> 00:35:05.699]  You get them for $195, $250, depending on the model you're getting.
[00:35:06.309 --> 00:35:09.252]  Debbie Morrow, New Millennium Concepts, thank you for coming on with us.
[00:35:09.792 --> 00:35:11.253]  Alex, thank you for having me.
[00:35:11.313 --> 00:35:26.305]  I was listening to you while I was on hold and I couldn't agree with you more about all of these contaminants that are in the water that are causing people to get sicker and sicker all the time when they lead a normally healthy lifestyle.
[00:35:26.726 --> 00:35:29.228]  And that's why I feel like we really need to
[00:35:29.724 --> 00:35:35.387]  Well, let me explain something.
[00:35:35.507 --> 00:35:49.633]  I did research, I don't know now, 8 years ago, I keep saying 5, no it was in 98, on what the best water filters were and I found the big Berkey from all the studies, all the reports, and now, so I was buying these before you guys were a sponsor.
[00:35:50.014 --> 00:35:51.694]  And I want everybody to buy one right now.
[00:35:52.355 --> 00:35:59.138]  Well, I think that's a great idea and especially right now while we do have the supplies in because as you did state,
[00:35:59.611 --> 00:36:18.167]  When it's been the normal thing you know I've been here since 98 since you first got your original Berkey and whenever there's a crisis in the US that's when we get really really really busy so this would be a good time while there's a lull to get your Berkey and start using it.
[00:36:18.248 --> 00:36:26.535]  Don't put it in the closet and save it for Y2K or for some kind of disaster that you think is going to happen because the Berkey
[00:36:27.145 --> 00:36:29.426]  It's something that you use every single day.
[00:36:29.446 --> 00:36:33.308]  It does tens of thousands of gallons of the elements.
[00:36:33.848 --> 00:36:37.490]  So it'll be years and years, decades, until you need to get a new one.
[00:36:37.930 --> 00:36:39.630]  And you can also buy replacement elements.
[00:36:39.690 --> 00:36:41.351]  Debbie, tell folks about some of the specials.
[00:36:42.011 --> 00:36:46.553]  We have the Berkey Light Special with the Berkey Light for $199.
[00:36:47.094 --> 00:36:50.995]  And with it they get a free Berkey Sport Bottle, the generic labeled one.
[00:36:51.616 --> 00:36:54.757]  Or they can get a bottle of Tassimidate.
[00:36:55.618 --> 00:37:04.722]  And we have the Berkey light with the lights for $2.59 and with that they can get the respective two of either or one of each.
[00:37:05.222 --> 00:37:07.703]  Same thing with the stainless steel Berkeys.
[00:37:08.083 --> 00:37:19.428]  We have so many different specials available that the best thing is give us a call and I'll run it by, find out what your needs are and make sure that we fit the system that you need for your lifestyle.
[00:37:19.808 --> 00:37:23.429]  We also have the five Berkey sport bottles generic labeled for $99.
[00:37:25.992 --> 00:37:48.162]  And those are great to, especially during this hot summer months, you're sending the kids to soccer and baseball and, you know, all the different games and different things that they do, take a Berkey Sport bottle with you so that you can just use the tap water and drink filtered water while you're there and not have to buy bottled water while you're on the go.
[00:37:50.512 --> 00:37:52.113]  Well, you're absolutely right, folks.
[00:37:52.213 --> 00:37:53.294]  Give Debbie a call.
[00:37:53.354 --> 00:37:53.834]  It's 1-888-803-4438, 888-803-4438.
[00:37:53.854 --> 00:37:55.295]  Or go to BerkeyWater.com.
[00:37:55.315 --> 00:37:58.777]  You go to BerkeyWater.com, you can put in the little comment section what free gift you want.
[00:37:58.797 --> 00:37:59.998]  They've got the free gifts.
[00:38:08.042 --> 00:38:12.683]  Listed right there, or go to Infowars.com, exact same Berkey's, exact same prices.
[00:38:13.104 --> 00:38:15.504]  We just fax them the orders over every day as they come in.
[00:38:15.864 --> 00:38:21.946]  So order at Infowars.com, order at Berkeywater.com, or call 1-888-803-4438.
[00:38:22.926 --> 00:38:25.547]  And if the phone's busy, leave your name and number.
[00:38:25.847 --> 00:38:28.248]  They'll call you right back.
[00:38:28.268 --> 00:38:29.048]  888-803-4438.
[00:38:29.108 --> 00:38:30.889]  They're getting really busy right now.
[00:38:30.969 --> 00:38:32.109]  People are starting to wake up.
[00:38:32.649 --> 00:38:34.810]  But again, I wouldn't get one because of the hurricanes.
[00:38:34.850 --> 00:38:37.071]  That's just a caveat reason, a little side issue.
[00:38:37.511 --> 00:38:38.731]  It's what's already in the water.
[00:38:38.811 --> 00:38:40.012]  Go to the EPA's website.
[00:38:40.072 --> 00:38:41.172]  See what is allowable.
[00:38:41.873 --> 00:38:47.555]  Understand the key here is the chlorine, which is toxic by itself, only kills the bacteria.
[00:38:47.575 --> 00:38:48.595]  You're still drinking.
[00:38:49.355 --> 00:38:53.457]  And in so many cities, there are toilets to tap where they actually take sewage water
[00:38:54.196 --> 00:38:55.016]  Dallas does it.
[00:38:55.196 --> 00:38:55.397]  L.A.
[00:38:55.437 --> 00:38:55.817]  does it.
[00:38:55.917 --> 00:38:56.297]  I don't know.
[00:38:56.317 --> 00:38:57.677]  Houston does it in some areas.
[00:38:57.717 --> 00:38:58.938]  I don't know how you drink that, folks.
[00:38:59.418 --> 00:39:01.959]  How do you feed your children sewage water that's been ghost?
[00:39:02.519 --> 00:39:04.880]  Again, I've talked to pool people at the neighborhood pool.
[00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:08.422]  I've talked to hot tub people when I see them driving around the neighborhood.
[00:39:08.442 --> 00:39:11.063]  Because the first time I heard it from my dad, I didn't believe it.
[00:39:11.583 --> 00:39:13.424]  He talked to one of his patients who's a pool guy.
[00:39:13.984 --> 00:39:18.386]  You can put fish in a pool of freshly dumped tap water.
[00:39:18.426 --> 00:39:19.046]  They will die.
[00:39:19.586 --> 00:39:22.027]  It has a higher level on average in Austin
[00:39:22.791 --> 00:39:25.932]  And then it does with actual pool water.
[00:39:26.573 --> 00:39:29.334]  Now understand, ladies and gentlemen, you're not supposed to drink pool water.
[00:39:29.394 --> 00:39:31.134]  What are you doing drinking tap water?
[00:39:31.654 --> 00:39:33.835]  Give Debbie a call, 888-803-4438.
[00:39:34.396 --> 00:39:36.796]  Debbie, thanks for coming on with us.
[00:39:36.816 --> 00:39:37.657]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:39:37.817 --> 00:39:38.637]  Have a great day.
[00:39:38.717 --> 00:39:39.518]  You too, thank you.
[00:39:40.738 --> 00:39:41.318]  God bless you.
[00:39:41.698 --> 00:39:42.659]  Give her a call, folks.
[00:39:42.699 --> 00:39:43.199]  Don't wait.
[00:39:43.219 --> 00:39:46.400]  Alright, I'm told Maury disagrees from Arizona.
[00:39:46.440 --> 00:39:47.461]  He goes to the head of the line.
[00:39:47.501 --> 00:39:48.341]  Go ahead, you're on the air.
[00:39:49.187 --> 00:39:51.548]  Hi Alex, thank you for letting me come on in.
[00:39:51.628 --> 00:40:06.837]  I wanted to make a comment about the preacher, Revere, I guess his name is, that says that Homeland Security is telling the preachers of the country to use Romans 14 to get the people to surrender their weapons, or gun confiscation.
[00:40:07.578 --> 00:40:13.401]  I'd like to point out that the government of the United States is against the laws of God.
[00:40:14.332 --> 00:40:15.392]  Particularly a sodomy?
[00:40:16.092 --> 00:40:17.413]  Okay, what do you disagree with?
[00:40:17.433 --> 00:40:18.713]  Because I don't know what you're talking about.
[00:40:18.933 --> 00:40:20.613]  Okay, well let me finish.
[00:40:20.693 --> 00:40:28.034]  I'm saying that Romans 13 cannot be used to... Well, we disagree with that too, sir, but they are using that.
[00:40:28.534 --> 00:40:30.755]  The report is they're using that.
[00:40:31.055 --> 00:40:32.375]  We're not saying it's valid.
[00:40:33.035 --> 00:40:34.876]  Okay, let me finish my statement, okay?
[00:40:35.476 --> 00:40:38.696]  You know, in the scripture it actually says that God wants you to be armed.
[00:40:38.776 --> 00:40:39.776]  You know, this is Luke 11.
[00:40:39.876 --> 00:40:41.377]  No, no, I'm going to stop you, sir.
[00:40:41.757 --> 00:40:42.297]  Okay.
[00:40:42.437 --> 00:40:42.937]  Put him on hold.
[00:40:43.547 --> 00:40:48.751]  We have a rule that you go to the head of the line if you disagree with me.
[00:40:48.831 --> 00:40:58.999]  But what's happening is people just call in and then say that I disagree and then it makes it sound like I'm saying Romans 13 is valid.
[00:40:59.019 --> 00:41:00.300]  It's taken out of context.
[00:41:00.660 --> 00:41:01.981]  It was Hitler's favorite quote.
[00:41:02.361 --> 00:41:07.285]  Almost all the prophets were killed or imprisoned for criticizing the government and wicked government.
[00:41:07.325 --> 00:41:09.487]  John the Baptist, the list goes on and on.
[00:41:09.567 --> 00:41:10.528]  Paul the Apostle.
[00:41:11.108 --> 00:41:12.069]  I mean, you know,
[00:41:13.297 --> 00:41:31.275]  So, sir, what we're reporting is, you can say you disagree with our report, what we're reporting is, is that FEMA is telling the preachers to go out and use Romans 13 with the interpretation that do whatever government says.
[00:41:31.295 --> 00:41:33.918]  So I want to make it clear, I don't agree with that, sir.
[00:41:34.178 --> 00:41:35.199]  Now you can go ahead and make your point.
[00:41:35.982 --> 00:41:42.965]  Okay, well, my point is that the scriptures in the Bible say that, you know, if you don't have clothes, buy a sword.
[00:41:43.925 --> 00:41:53.008]  And the other thing is, an armed man is safe in his house and his possessions, and he that breaks into pieces is at your face, hold on munitions.
[00:41:53.649 --> 00:41:55.049]  So God is very clear.
[00:41:55.089 --> 00:41:59.191]  He's telling us He wants us to be armed on a personal basis, and that's the guns today.
[00:41:59.211 --> 00:42:01.491]  Okay, what do you disagree with?
[00:42:01.551 --> 00:42:02.872]  I'm trying to figure this out.
[00:42:04.955 --> 00:42:06.175]  I'm sorry, say the comment.
[00:42:06.236 --> 00:42:07.636]  You said you disagreed with me.
[00:42:08.156 --> 00:42:09.657]  What do you disagree with that I've said?
[00:42:09.977 --> 00:42:14.798]  Well, I think what you just said in retaliation to me was correct.
[00:42:15.319 --> 00:42:19.040]  When the preacher first came out, you didn't make it clear that Romans 13 cannot be used.
[00:42:19.060 --> 00:42:20.841]  That's what I was disagreeing about.
[00:42:21.401 --> 00:42:22.341]  Actually, I did.
[00:42:22.401 --> 00:42:23.241]  I remember the interview.
[00:42:23.601 --> 00:42:26.883]  Okay, well, now I understand what you're saying, and I appreciate it.
[00:42:26.903 --> 00:42:27.743]  Thank you for letting me come on.
[00:42:28.463 --> 00:42:29.383]  No, no, thank you, sir.
[00:42:29.483 --> 00:42:33.445]  I mean, why don't you explain to people, if you have a knowledge of this, what's wrong with Romans 13?
[00:42:34.591 --> 00:42:38.036]  Well, Romans 13 only applies to godly government.
[00:42:38.957 --> 00:42:42.722]  And when we don't have a godly government, then Romans 13 does not apply.
[00:42:42.742 --> 00:42:47.589]  And, you know, we are required to stand up for God.
[00:42:47.609 --> 00:42:51.034]  In fact, God just cries out, Who stands up for me against the evil people?
[00:42:51.556 --> 00:42:54.117]  Who stands up for me against the wicked?
[00:42:54.197 --> 00:42:57.599]  Who will stand up for me against the wicked doers?
[00:42:58.100 --> 00:42:58.820]  That's right.
[00:42:58.980 --> 00:43:03.082]  When the enemy comes in like a flood, the Spirit of the Lord lifts up a standard against it.
[00:43:03.122 --> 00:43:17.130]  Well, anyone who's been in Sunday School, anyone who's read any, you can open the Bible anywhere, I would say the most dominant theme in the Holy Bible, Old and New Testament, is God commanding people to stand up against evil and say no to evil government.
[00:43:17.410 --> 00:43:17.870]  That's correct.
[00:43:18.031 --> 00:43:23.634]  And, I mean, that's just every chapter, everything I've... literally, folks, I have a Bible in every room in my house.
[00:43:23.694 --> 00:43:28.277]  I just randomly open it, and just... that's every chapter!
[00:43:28.837 --> 00:43:32.940]  It's... it is the... do you agree it is the most dominant theme in the Bible?
[00:43:32.980 --> 00:43:35.381]  It is the preeminent theme to stand up against evil government?
[00:43:35.701 --> 00:43:36.262]  Absolutely!
[00:43:36.582 --> 00:43:36.902]  Absolutely!
[00:43:37.002 --> 00:43:42.325]  And so how do these preachers teach to do whatever the government says, lay down, follow their orders?
[00:43:42.366 --> 00:43:44.907]  That is... that is total garbage!
[00:43:45.487 --> 00:43:45.808]  I agree.
[00:43:46.128 --> 00:43:46.288]  I agree.
[00:43:47.097 --> 00:43:47.718]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:43:47.838 --> 00:43:49.560]  I appreciate you letting me come in.
[00:43:49.600 --> 00:43:50.161]  Sure, thank you.
[00:43:50.221 --> 00:43:51.522]  I don't want to sound like I'm being rude here.
[00:43:51.542 --> 00:43:57.509]  You're just saying people are going to think I agree with the misinterpretation, misapplication of Romans 13.
[00:43:57.669 --> 00:44:01.914]  I've probably had four or five preachers on in the last six months.
[00:44:01.954 --> 00:44:03.676]  Butch Paul among them of this network.
[00:44:05.057 --> 00:44:06.998]  Dissecting Romans 13 arguments.
[00:44:07.479 --> 00:44:09.701]  I mean, that was all over Hitler's newsreels.
[00:44:09.761 --> 00:44:12.783]  The Soviets used it against Christians in the Ukraine.
[00:44:13.464 --> 00:44:14.325]  Oh, you know, Romans 13.
[00:44:14.485 --> 00:44:18.688]  Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and unto God the things that are God's.
[00:44:19.749 --> 00:44:23.653]  Then you read before it and after it, it's totally taken out of context.
[00:44:23.673 --> 00:44:26.315]  You know, I mean, if that's the case, why did they kill Christ?
[00:44:26.975 --> 00:44:28.196]  Why did they kill Paul?
[00:44:28.316 --> 00:44:32.320]  Why did they kill... There were only a couple prophets they didn't kill.
[00:44:33.823 --> 00:44:34.623]  Who, Elijah?
[00:44:34.683 --> 00:44:35.243]  A few others?
[00:44:35.283 --> 00:44:36.584]  I mean, they killed them all!
[00:44:38.104 --> 00:44:39.124]  Or they tried to kill them!
[00:44:40.724 --> 00:44:42.805]  Over and over and over and over again!
[00:44:43.645 --> 00:44:45.905]  I mean, what did John the Baptist do when they cut his head off?
[00:44:45.925 --> 00:44:48.346]  He went into Herod and he said, you're a degenerate piece of filth!
[00:44:49.066 --> 00:44:50.526]  You're an absolute abomination!
[00:44:51.406 --> 00:44:53.667]  And Herod said, I'm gonna cut your head off, boy!
[00:44:54.627 --> 00:44:57.387]  They had it put on a silver platter and brought to him.
[00:44:59.048 --> 00:44:59.588]  I mean, he...
[00:45:01.616 --> 00:45:04.018]  Was he supposed to submit to Herod?
[00:45:04.839 --> 00:45:06.340]  Were the Founding Fathers bad?
[00:45:06.360 --> 00:45:08.262]  Were we bad for fighting Hitler?
[00:45:10.004 --> 00:45:11.065]  Was anybody bad?
[00:45:14.268 --> 00:45:18.972]  Folks, they teach it in the Catholic churches, the Baptist churches, they teach it everywhere.
[00:45:19.853 --> 00:45:21.034]  And it is unbelievable.
[00:45:21.074 --> 00:45:22.535]  Let's talk to Joe in Wisconsin.
[00:45:22.555 --> 00:45:23.176]  Joe, go ahead.
[00:45:23.196 --> 00:45:25.218]  Hey Alex, wow, what a lead-in.
[00:45:26.292 --> 00:45:30.416]  I want to talk about the social conditioning for the war or the cheaping of America.
[00:45:30.816 --> 00:45:33.859]  First, we're being taught that defending yourself is wrong.
[00:45:34.079 --> 00:45:37.382]  Take a look at what they're saying about Iran and retribution.
[00:45:37.783 --> 00:45:39.064]  You've covered it how many times?
[00:45:39.444 --> 00:45:42.808]  You said if they dare defend themselves, how dare they?
[00:45:43.428 --> 00:45:48.333]  It sounds like they're already conditioning people that preemption is good and it will be done.
[00:45:48.888 --> 00:45:57.052]  So, we're being sent the message, hey, if you think you're going to get anywhere, and if you think you're going to defend yourself, you'll wind up just like, I'll fill in the blank.
[00:45:57.732 --> 00:46:12.579]  And I'm wanting to go into further things that will happen here, rather than Iran, but the things that will happen as a consequence, like martial law, if it does break forth, because of bird flu, fill in the blank, whatever excuse.
[00:46:13.625 --> 00:46:15.326]  There's going to be collateral damage.
[00:46:15.826 --> 00:46:16.846]  I know what there will be.
[00:46:17.666 --> 00:46:20.007]  It should be avoided at all costs, but it's inevitable.
[00:46:20.367 --> 00:46:25.509]  But suppose an American defends himself and a bystander gets caught in the crossfire.
[00:46:25.649 --> 00:46:34.471]  You know, and I do, the PR propaganda machines will just use it as a smear campaign and then just say, no, no, no, now you're going to have to be all sheep.
[00:46:34.491 --> 00:46:35.032]  That's right.
[00:46:35.052 --> 00:46:40.433]  During the hysteria as the government tried to maintain order, citizens and vigilante groups went wild.
[00:46:40.733 --> 00:46:41.193]  That's it.
[00:46:41.233 --> 00:46:42.834]  We're confiscating all guns.
[00:46:43.331 --> 00:46:46.852]  Yeah, well I wanted to ask you some really quick things that breaks it down.
[00:46:46.932 --> 00:46:50.533]  It's like the Shultz and Neese quote, but what is innocence?
[00:46:51.053 --> 00:46:53.674]  And is it a brown shirt just doing his job?
[00:46:53.694 --> 00:46:54.794]  A useful idiot?
[00:46:55.214 --> 00:46:56.394]  What about resisting evil?
[00:46:56.994 --> 00:47:02.636]  What if they want to drug you to make you more docile, and I think, more susceptible to demonic forces?
[00:47:04.016 --> 00:47:05.016]  Well let me try to answer that.
[00:47:05.036 --> 00:47:05.936]  I appreciate your call.
[00:47:06.717 --> 00:47:07.937]  We had a preacher on
[00:47:08.797 --> 00:47:14.307]  Last week, we have his name, we have the documents, we published all the documents we can without getting him in trouble.
[00:47:15.409 --> 00:47:18.435]  It's up on Infowars.com, on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:47:21.591 --> 00:47:45.534]  It is confirmed in 13,000 plus counties in the last year, they've been covertly, but it's even in official documents, recruiting pastors to prepare their flocks for gun confiscation, for all of this, and they've told them, relocation centers, emergency roundups, martial law, that term's been used, the public may need to be drugged psychotropically, because if you don't submit, you're mentally ill, the preachers have to tell their flocks to take these drugs,
[00:47:46.241 --> 00:47:51.765]  I mean, all we know is the government is preparing in earnest for this.
[00:47:52.326 --> 00:47:55.989]  All the training, all the decades-long preparation is coming to a head.
[00:47:56.849 --> 00:48:11.501]  Ray McGovern, top CI analyst, and a whole bunch of other analysts that are part of his organization, veteran intelligence analysts for Sanity, a lot of other experts are saying, and the neocons are on the air saying, they may attack Iran the next three to six months, maybe even the next two months.
[00:48:12.228 --> 00:48:19.235]  That it needs to happen, that if Israel strikes them and if Iran fights back, that Iran has launched the attack.
[00:48:19.435 --> 00:48:25.320]  Imagine, we attack you, if you fight back, we consider that a premeditated first strike.
[00:48:26.261 --> 00:48:29.124]  They consider it to be a sneak attack by Iran if they fight back.
[00:48:29.648 --> 00:48:52.547]  And that they will then nuke them with mini-nukes, Iran will go absolutely ape, and the Rehman government believes there's a very good chance our government will carry out terror attacks, or another Western government will, Israel or the UK mainly, or some private mercenary organization, which we know they're using, these private firms, will carry out attacks before or during, and blame it on Iran if Iran doesn't strike.
[00:48:52.947 --> 00:48:55.209]  But again, Iran probably will launch attacks.
[00:48:55.868 --> 00:48:56.689]  What do you call those?
[00:48:56.729 --> 00:48:59.291]  You'll call those suicide attacks, terror attacks.
[00:48:59.951 --> 00:49:01.853]  What do you call it when you get attacked and you fight back?
[00:49:01.893 --> 00:49:02.693]  It's called terrorism.
[00:49:03.134 --> 00:49:07.197]  When the SWAT team comes to your house, take your guns, and you fight back, they call you a terrorist on the news.
[00:49:08.077 --> 00:49:09.278]  It's the same thing.
[00:49:09.639 --> 00:49:13.862]  And the globalists want to escalate this into a worldwide calamity.
[00:49:14.853 --> 00:49:22.517]  They want to use it as a smokescreen to plunge the stock market and grab the pension funds, because you'll be cheering as you give up your pension funds, because we're in a fight with them Iranians!
[00:49:22.817 --> 00:49:23.797]  Them Arabs!
[00:49:24.037 --> 00:49:26.298]  Well, they're not even Arabs, as people like to call them.
[00:49:26.839 --> 00:49:27.679]  They are Persians.
[00:49:28.520 --> 00:49:29.880]  And think what Iran's gone through.
[00:49:29.920 --> 00:49:30.681]  No wonder they hate us.
[00:49:30.721 --> 00:49:31.641]  I'm not saying they're perfect.
[00:49:33.242 --> 00:49:34.282]  But what's happened?
[00:49:34.322 --> 00:49:37.724]  Our government overthrew their elected government in 1953 that was pro-America.
[00:49:38.334 --> 00:49:40.836]  They put in the Shah, who tortured and killed hundreds of thousands.
[00:49:41.316 --> 00:49:42.537]  Then the radicals took over.
[00:49:43.017 --> 00:49:49.301]  Our government shot down their jetliners, blown up their ships, had the Iraqis attack them, gave them 30 plus billion to do it.
[00:49:49.641 --> 00:49:52.703]  Over a million and a half Iranians died keeping their country.
[00:49:53.244 --> 00:49:58.287]  I mean, imagine if, say, Mexico had attacked us and been funded, say, by Germany.
[00:49:59.096 --> 00:50:00.997]  Which they tried to do in World War I and World War II.
[00:50:01.497 --> 00:50:04.279]  But let's hypothetically say they killed a million-two Americans.
[00:50:04.919 --> 00:50:06.219]  They'd shot down our planes.
[00:50:06.239 --> 00:50:07.740]  They'd overthrown our government once.
[00:50:08.040 --> 00:50:09.321]  We'd gotten our government back.
[00:50:09.761 --> 00:50:12.322]  What would you think of the Mexicans, hypothetically?
[00:50:13.623 --> 00:50:14.804]  I mean, that's what we've done.
[00:50:14.844 --> 00:50:18.005]  That is, the globalists have done, using American muscle and British muscle.
[00:50:18.966 --> 00:50:20.306]  I mean, what do they think of us?
[00:50:21.387 --> 00:50:22.187]  Why do they hate us?
[00:50:22.267 --> 00:50:23.608]  Why do they call us the Great Satan?
[00:50:24.368 --> 00:50:27.830]  They're a third world slash ancient culture.
[00:50:29.033 --> 00:50:30.434]  And they got satellite TV.
[00:50:30.494 --> 00:50:36.158]  Man, they see the men in bed together, women in bed together, all this stuff, all this weird devil stuff on MTV.
[00:50:36.218 --> 00:50:37.199]  It freaks them out, folks.
[00:50:37.219 --> 00:50:37.999]  They're scared of us.
[00:50:39.280 --> 00:50:40.801]  And frankly, I'm scared of us, too.
[00:50:41.482 --> 00:50:43.763]  I mean, we're the country that genetically engineers the food.
[00:50:44.304 --> 00:50:46.625]  We're the ones that have got one in three people with diabetes.
[00:50:46.685 --> 00:50:49.247]  I mean, we're wallowing in death, folks.
[00:50:49.427 --> 00:50:50.928]  People can smell us a mile away.
[00:50:50.968 --> 00:50:53.450]  I mean, we stink like a pile of dead pigs.
[00:50:54.250 --> 00:50:55.151]  So, I don't know.
[00:50:55.811 --> 00:50:56.472]  Just look at us.
[00:50:57.831 --> 00:50:59.872]  We are the Great Satan, ladies and gentlemen!
[00:51:01.692 --> 00:51:09.935]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here, and I'm excited to announce we're going to have a huge 9-11 conference in downtown Los Angeles on the 24th and 25th of June.
[00:51:10.135 --> 00:51:12.476]  We're expecting around a thousand people in attendance.
[00:51:13.076 --> 00:51:21.919]  At this historic event, we will irrefutably document that 9-11 was an inside job, a self-inflicted wound, a false flag tear operation.
[00:51:22.439 --> 00:51:25.981]  The conference is titled 9-11 and the Neo-Con Agenda.

[00:54:22.223 --> 00:54:23.985]  All the evidence points towards them doing it.
[00:54:24.065 --> 00:54:26.328]  Analysts I trust and respect say it's going to happen.
[00:54:26.708 --> 00:54:28.110]  It's almost a virtual certainty.
[00:54:28.170 --> 00:54:29.451]  There's a few ways to turn it around.
[00:54:29.491 --> 00:54:30.713]  We're trying here.

[00:55:58.700 --> 00:55:59.821]  Let's go to Dr. Bill Deagle.
[00:55:59.841 --> 00:56:01.321]  He has a talk show right here on Genesis.
[00:56:01.361 --> 00:56:03.402]  He's a medical doctor living in Canada.
[00:56:03.662 --> 00:56:10.505]  Dr. Deagle, you wanted to comment on the genetically engineered foods and 1 in 3 now having diabetes directly linked to that, not the corn syrup.
[00:56:11.385 --> 00:56:11.905]  Absolutely.
[00:56:11.945 --> 00:56:18.728]  In fact, what's going on now, the GMO foods not only have organic acids that have never before been seen in any life form,
[00:56:19.827 --> 00:56:27.550]  But the way observed nutrients occur in the body is by pinocytosis, where the microparticles get absorbed into the cell, and the cell has to recognize the nutrients.
[00:56:27.590 --> 00:56:35.393]  But when it sees genes and molecules from scorpions and other genera that it never saw before, it can't absorb it.
[00:56:35.634 --> 00:56:41.276]  And so we're going to have a tremendous explosion of birth defects, developmental diseases,
[00:56:42.299 --> 00:56:46.883]  Neurodegenerative... We're already seeing it, and then they claim, oh, it's women drinking.
[00:56:47.143 --> 00:56:53.308]  But statistically, 60-50 years ago, I just read the statistics study yesterday, women are drinking less while they're pregnant.
[00:56:53.528 --> 00:56:56.910]  People used to drink like fish, and you didn't have all this, so they blame it.
[00:56:57.190 --> 00:57:05.917]  It's like they're blaming secondhand smoke for a six-fold increase in the last five years in lung cancer, and it's not that, because secondhand smoke is down.
[00:57:06.297 --> 00:57:08.319]  Right, it's depleted uranium worldwide, period.
[00:57:09.347 --> 00:57:09.808]  We know that.
[00:57:10.048 --> 00:57:27.860]  We know that the single independent factor that's increasing worldwide, the amount of EU-coordinated nuclear experts is four to eight times as much as the maximum allowed standard for an environmental protection agency for uranium miners breezed by every person on earth now from the EU, caused by Gulf War I and II.
[00:57:28.461 --> 00:57:29.141]  It's ridiculous.
[00:57:29.321 --> 00:57:34.425]  And if this next war happens, it's going to cause an explosion of diabetes, birth defects worldwide,
[00:57:35.895 --> 00:57:37.136]  That's right, that's right.
[00:57:37.316 --> 00:57:45.203]  You know, they went from just having it in Abrams tanks and in the Vulcan cannons and the A-10s to now in hundreds of munitions and they're now serving it up.
[00:57:45.343 --> 00:57:50.147]  Almost all the bombs they're going to be using in a huge bombardment are DU-tipped.
[00:57:50.507 --> 00:57:52.188]  It aerosolizes upon impact.
[00:57:52.528 --> 00:57:59.974]  Yeah, it's going to be roughly about 60% of the actual dry weight of the munition before it's fired is actually aerosolized and spreads around the entire planet.
[00:58:00.655 --> 00:58:01.756]  And this is a holocaust.
[00:58:02.771 --> 00:58:08.875]  Long after the sun is burned out 24 and a half billion years from now, there'll still be residual DU from Gulf War I and II.
[00:58:10.656 --> 00:58:15.098]  Yeah, space aliens will fly by the planet and their detectors will pick it up and they'll go, look at those idiots.
[00:58:15.759 --> 00:58:18.500]  What type of idiots would kill themselves?
[00:58:18.900 --> 00:58:26.024]  Just the amount of DU used in the New Iraq War, this is official numbers, 44,000 Hiroshima bombs.
[00:58:26.305 --> 00:58:27.025]  Isn't that amazing?
[00:58:27.914 --> 00:58:32.257]  44,000!
[00:58:29.575 --> 00:58:32.257]  We've got to stop this or they're going to destroy life on this planet.
[00:58:32.437 --> 00:58:34.658]  Stay there, Dr. Beagle, Medical Doctor joining us.
[00:58:34.998 --> 00:58:37.780]  We'll be right back, let him talk a little bit more, then we'll go to all your other calls.
[00:58:37.800 --> 00:58:38.800]  You'll want to stay with us.
[00:58:41.602 --> 00:58:46.505]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNLive.com or call toll free 877-300-7645.
[00:58:58.098 --> 00:58:58.719]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.400 --> 00:59:00.460]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:01.161 --> 00:59:02.262]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.922 --> 00:59:03.743]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.504 --> 00:59:05.425]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:06.085 --> 00:59:09.808]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.249 --> 00:59:14.372]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:15.613 --> 00:59:17.435]  Dr. Bill Deagle has called in.
[00:59:17.475 --> 00:59:21.178]  He's responding to my report about World War III coming up from Iran.
[00:59:22.651 --> 00:59:33.969]  I also talk about the cell phones frying our brains, the sodium fluoride poisoning us, the genetic engineering creating new enzymes and new amino acids that have never existed that are causing massive health problems.
[00:59:34.009 --> 00:59:36.512]  All the top scientists we've had on major reports.
[00:59:36.532 --> 00:59:37.334]  There's no debating it.
[00:59:37.970 --> 00:59:47.897]  DU being used, the equivalent of 44,000 A-bombs, the exact weight and type isotope, just used in the last Gulf War and still ongoing, blowing all over the planet.
[00:59:48.177 --> 00:59:49.958]  Detectors in England, Europe, and the U.S.
[00:59:49.978 --> 00:59:54.462]  picking up upwards of eight times safe levels that are allowed for uranium miners.
[00:59:55.883 --> 00:59:57.264]  What Deagle said is on the record.
[00:59:57.304 --> 00:59:59.645]  We've had top experts and scientists on covering this.
[01:00:00.226 --> 01:00:06.230]  My question to you, Dr. Deagle, and we'll go to some more calls, folks, that are holding, Bart and Luis and Beth and everybody else, Matt and Bill,
[01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:08.460]  Why is the elite so nuts?
[01:00:08.480 --> 01:00:17.123]  It was like last year it came out that millions of gallons of solid nerve gas were dumped 54 miles, 55 miles off the coast of North Carolina.
[01:00:17.523 --> 01:00:19.483]  It's showing up in the shellfish, everything.
[01:00:19.743 --> 01:00:23.684]  And the elite take their kids in and have them eat, you know, eat this stuff for dinner.
[01:00:24.064 --> 01:00:27.925]  I mean, why are the elite so crazy that they're even doing this to themselves?
[01:00:29.026 --> 01:00:29.846]  It's a death culture.
[01:00:29.866 --> 01:00:33.967]  These elite are all part of a death culture, just like the Nazi Germany
[01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:36.241]  Well, we have an American... Or Dr. Bianca!
[01:00:36.261 --> 01:00:38.903]  Dr. Bianca of UT that says we've all got to die!
[01:00:39.264 --> 01:00:44.267]  Exactly, and we're really living in the Fourth Reich right now, because the Third Reich never really died.
[01:00:45.088 --> 01:00:51.752]  We are the descendants with the Operation Paperclip and all the scientists and Nazi horrors that came over here to America.
[01:00:52.193 --> 01:00:56.776]  All of our secret agencies are basically the... receive the endowment of these monsters.
[01:00:57.517 --> 01:01:00.739]  And our entire culture is now immersed in death, so America is the
[01:01:01.246 --> 01:01:03.107]  Broodmare for the New World Order.
[01:01:03.167 --> 01:01:04.828]  Forty-five million abortions!
[01:01:04.888 --> 01:01:06.448]  I mean, it's incredible!
[01:01:06.988 --> 01:01:13.311]  Yeah, and so they're moving us very quickly, and I believe that this war will trigger off an attack by China against Taiwan.
[01:01:13.331 --> 01:01:16.552]  They want to mine the Strait of Hormuz, which will immediately crash the world economy.
[01:01:17.073 --> 01:01:26.497]  This is all by design, the same way they're already telling us they're going to release, you know, I like your term called the Zicronian Twelve Plague, because I really believe they're going to do it in the next few years.
[01:01:26.997 --> 01:01:29.558]  They're going to do it, and they have it all planned to stick the chips in us.
[01:01:30.268 --> 01:01:32.108]  All of this has been completely by design.
[01:01:34.789 --> 01:01:39.090]  And I guess a lot of people are going to cheerlead their own destruction here in America.
[01:01:39.290 --> 01:01:40.170]  Yeah, it's amazing.
[01:01:40.230 --> 01:01:44.351]  If just the minorities would stand up and just say, hell no, it would be over.
[01:01:45.252 --> 01:01:49.573]  But we need to now, as Pastor Butch said last week, we need to say, now it's time for civil disobedience.
[01:01:49.653 --> 01:01:50.993]  No more national ID.
[01:01:51.613 --> 01:01:53.274]  No more disarming the public.
[01:01:53.374 --> 01:01:54.734]  No more forced vaccines.
[01:01:55.274 --> 01:01:56.474]  No more GMO food.
[01:01:56.494 --> 01:01:57.775]  No more fluoride in our water.
[01:01:57.815 --> 01:01:58.255]  That's it.
[01:01:58.355 --> 01:01:58.475]  No.
[01:01:59.778 --> 01:02:05.942]  No more corrupt medical system, no more corrupt legal system, and no more transnational corporations raping and pillaging our country.
[01:02:06.782 --> 01:02:07.763]  I hear you, Dr. Deagle.
[01:02:07.783 --> 01:02:08.624]  Thanks for the call.
[01:02:09.084 --> 01:02:10.285]  Always good to hear from you.
[01:02:10.385 --> 01:02:11.846]  Let's talk to Bart in Texas.
[01:02:11.906 --> 01:02:12.606]  Bart, you're on the air.
[01:02:12.626 --> 01:02:13.226]  Thanks for holding.
[01:02:14.607 --> 01:02:15.168]  Hey, Alex.
[01:02:15.988 --> 01:02:21.632]  I have a question for you, and it involves Iran, and it really involves the overall structure of the New World Order.
[01:02:21.652 --> 01:02:28.176]  You know, since I started watching you back in 96 in Austin, I've researched this, you know, the entire time.
[01:02:28.792 --> 01:02:48.741]  And I've really been trying to understand because, you know, listening to your guest the other day that was talking about her confrontation, and I watched the video of her confrontation with some of the Omission Commission members, and it really was obvious that there was just stark terror in some of their eyes when she brought up some of these issues.
[01:02:48.881 --> 01:02:53.443]  Well, it's like the cops when they bust somebody and find the dead body and say, you're going to prison, buddy.
[01:02:54.218 --> 01:02:55.659]  Well, you know... And that's how they look!
[01:02:55.719 --> 01:02:56.679]  Oh, I've been caught!
[01:02:57.219 --> 01:03:02.861]  Well, my question is really straight to you, and it's about the nature of the New World Order.
[01:03:02.881 --> 01:03:19.428]  You know, sometimes it really does seem like we're just dealing with a neo-feudal kind of elitist criminal syndicate that do make mistakes, you know, and it seems that way when you see the fear in their eyes, but then at other levels it really does seem like this is just mastermind orchestrated
[01:03:19.813 --> 01:03:22.174]  And you see my quandary in trying to figure it out?
[01:03:22.214 --> 01:03:24.214]  There are different layers of the pyramid, sir.
[01:03:24.234 --> 01:03:26.115]  You're looking at minions on the commission.
[01:03:26.435 --> 01:03:27.575]  So of course they're scared.
[01:03:27.996 --> 01:03:30.716]  And you have the insulated Rockefellers and Rothschilds and others.
[01:03:32.097 --> 01:03:35.278]  And they're just very cold.
[01:03:35.298 --> 01:03:37.199]  They're like the depths of space.
[01:03:37.239 --> 01:03:38.319]  They're soulless.
[01:03:38.939 --> 01:03:41.640]  And they're like machines of wickedness just carrying out their plan.
[01:03:43.210 --> 01:03:44.752]  Can you hold me over for one last question?
[01:03:44.772 --> 01:03:45.152]  Sure, yeah.
[01:03:45.633 --> 01:03:48.317]  I mean, they're carrying out their father's design to kill everyone.
[01:03:48.377 --> 01:03:50.459]  Their father, the devil.
[01:03:50.479 --> 01:03:51.400]  Then it all makes sense.
[01:03:53.658 --> 01:04:01.906]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here and I'm excited to announce we're going to have a huge 9-11 conference in downtown Los Angeles on the 24th and 25th of June.
[01:04:02.106 --> 01:04:04.429]  We're expecting around 1,000 people in attendance.
[01:04:05.049 --> 01:04:13.898]  At this historic event, we will irrefutably document that 9-11 was an inside job, a self-inflicted wound, a false flag terror operation.
[01:04:14.418 --> 01:04:17.921]  The conference is titled 9-11 and the Neocon Agenda.
[01:04:18.361 --> 01:04:26.708]  I'm happy to announce the conference will feature presentations by incredible speakers like BYU physics professor Stephen Jones, the father of the Star Wars program, Lt.
[01:04:26.748 --> 01:04:27.069]  Col.
[01:04:27.149 --> 01:04:39.179]  Robert Bowman, former top-level CIA analyst for Reagan and Bush, Ray McGovern, 9-11 hero William Rodriguez, author Webster Charmpley, Professor Jim Fetzer, and many, many others, including special guests.
[01:04:39.499 --> 01:04:43.182]  I'll also be debuting my explosive new film, Terror Storm, at the conference.
[01:04:44.002 --> 01:04:56.484]  The War on Terrorism.
[01:04:56.824 --> 01:04:59.585]  Will it be fought overseas, or will it affect us here at home?
[01:04:59.865 --> 01:05:04.005]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[01:05:04.446 --> 01:05:05.286]  So what do you do?
[01:05:05.586 --> 01:05:10.167]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[01:05:10.647 --> 01:05:12.747]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[01:05:13.271 --> 01:05:14.152]  Sheltering in Place!
[01:05:14.552 --> 01:05:27.964]  Surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[01:05:28.004 --> 01:05:35.150]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[01:05:35.430 --> 01:05:38.593]  Get this critical video every American needs for only $29 plus shipping.
[01:05:40.254 --> 01:05:44.297]  Order by calling New Millennium today at 888-803-4438.
[01:05:44.598 --> 01:05:46.579]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:05:46.919 --> 01:05:51.563]  Or order on the web at Berkeywater.com.
[01:05:53.725 --> 01:05:55.566]  Gas prices are out of control.
[01:05:55.786 --> 01:05:59.950]  You drive up to the pump only to find that the price per gallon is up once again.
[01:06:00.310 --> 01:06:04.833]  If you want to save money at the pump and get back in the driver's seat, then listen closely.
[01:06:05.014 --> 01:06:09.057]  There is now a way to save up to 30% or more on your fuel bill
[01:06:09.377 --> 01:06:10.338]  We're good to go!
[01:06:29.071 --> 01:06:29.732]  I think so.
[01:06:54.855 --> 01:07:00.897]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:07:01.477 --> 01:07:04.538]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:05.498 --> 01:07:09.859]  Really, the discussion of the crawlers today has turned into a discussion of the death culture.
[01:07:10.339 --> 01:07:16.321]  Genetically engineered foods directly linked to 1 in 3 now having diabetes, cancers exploding,
[01:07:17.290 --> 01:07:21.212]  The poisons, the toxins in the water, the depleted uranium, lung cancer exploding.
[01:07:21.912 --> 01:07:24.393]  All of this going on and now they want to invade Iran.
[01:07:24.434 --> 01:07:25.554]  They're saying they're going to do it.
[01:07:25.654 --> 01:07:29.656]  The analysts that we trust say the Globalists plan to attack in the next six months.
[01:07:30.336 --> 01:07:31.577]  It's getting more and more serious.
[01:07:31.737 --> 01:07:35.439]  If that happens, our government will probably stage terror attacks and claim Iran did it.
[01:07:35.979 --> 01:07:39.641]  Or Iran may pull something, at least in their region.
[01:07:40.550 --> 01:07:42.791]  And it just hurdles us towards total crisis.
[01:07:42.871 --> 01:07:43.751]  Mark, finish up quickly.
[01:07:43.771 --> 01:07:44.471]  I want to move on here.
[01:07:44.891 --> 01:07:45.311]  Thank you, sir.
[01:07:45.972 --> 01:07:52.434]  Well, I've really reached the same conclusions you have about the nature and the structure that we're dealing with multiple levels and the neocons are just one level.
[01:07:52.874 --> 01:07:57.295]  But, you know, the conclusion that that leads me to is this is really still just the beginning.
[01:07:58.044 --> 01:08:04.009]  That there are whole levels of technology and deception that they haven't even begun to throw at us.
[01:08:04.189 --> 01:08:08.933]  And that feels disheartening sometimes, but that's really what it feels true to me.
[01:08:08.993 --> 01:08:10.734]  I appreciate your call.
[01:08:10.774 --> 01:08:14.457]  Listen, we have the patents going back 15 years.
[01:08:14.497 --> 01:08:19.121]  We have official studies that were done with different frequencies and wavelengths.
[01:08:19.602 --> 01:08:24.506]  It was even in, what was it, the Baltimore Sun about three years ago, DARPA
[01:08:25.638 --> 01:08:30.623]  The big government research laboratories reported, oh yeah, we've got systems that will make public docile.
[01:08:31.304 --> 01:08:34.006]  We're going to test putting up towers that broadcast this.
[01:08:34.086 --> 01:08:38.611]  I mean, you can go read mainstream news articles about the government putting up mind control towers.
[01:08:40.589 --> 01:08:44.791]  I mean, this type of stuff is really going on, and they really are.
[01:08:44.851 --> 01:08:48.293]  They did just pass a law in Wisconsin banning the forced microchipping of the public.
[01:08:48.673 --> 01:08:50.134]  I mean, it's that bad.
[01:08:50.174 --> 01:08:56.997]  This stuff's... They did pass a law last year saying that they're going to forcibly put half the kids in America on psychotropic drugs with new freedom.
[01:08:57.077 --> 01:09:01.099]  I mean, they really did pass a national ID card with a state driver's license last year.
[01:09:01.599 --> 01:09:09.103]  I mean, they really are... The Senate did just pass the law, the House is set to pass it for total blanket amnesty, and then they say it's not amnesty.
[01:09:09.563 --> 01:09:11.766]  You know, just all of this is really happening.
[01:09:12.166 --> 01:09:16.471]  The electronic voting machine companies really are government run and really are stealing elections.
[01:09:17.192 --> 01:09:24.160]  I mean, this stuff, all this incredible developments are really going on.
[01:09:24.200 --> 01:09:29.726]  We're living in unbelievably bizarre times when evil is making a big move.
[01:09:31.218 --> 01:09:35.541]  And the average American thinks it's all George Bush's fault and we can just get rid of Republicans and we'll be safe.
[01:09:35.581 --> 01:09:42.646]  And the average Republican thinks Bush is God and the conservatives are good and if we just attack Iran, everything will be fine.
[01:09:42.686 --> 01:09:54.354]  Meanwhile, their kids are drinking poison water and they're breathing DU and the food's full of GMO that's rotting out your organs and it's all admitted and it just, you don't, most people don't know what the real threats are.
[01:09:54.734 --> 01:09:59.976]  Humanity is under assault by a bunch of nut cases that are running our society!
[01:10:00.296 --> 01:10:03.617]  The architects of our society are a bunch of nuts, folks!
[01:10:03.637 --> 01:10:08.818]  A bunch of control freak, Malthusian, social Darwinistic criminals!
[01:10:10.158 --> 01:10:20.761]  I mean, that's really the gist of what this broadcast is, is a clarion call, an emergency transmission to you to look at the facts, to find out we're not exaggerating this.
[01:10:20.801 --> 01:10:22.962]  In fact, I don't have words to describe how
[01:10:24.352 --> 01:10:29.120]  Out of control the world has gotten, and if they attack Iran, it's going to get a lot worse a lot faster.
[01:10:29.902 --> 01:10:32.626]  Let's talk to Luis, I believe, in California.
[01:10:32.646 --> 01:10:33.187]  You're on the air.
[01:10:33.227 --> 01:10:33.608]  Go ahead.
[01:10:34.209 --> 01:10:38.376]  Quickly, I was at the post office the other day and I found a pamphlet
[01:10:38.966 --> 01:10:40.307]  Um, for Selective Service.
[01:10:40.667 --> 01:10:41.888]  And, um, I want to tell you about it.
[01:10:41.908 --> 01:10:45.150]  In fact, I want to send it to you, because I'm sure this is something you're going to want to post on your website.
[01:10:45.250 --> 01:10:48.512]  It's really, it looks really kind of subtly nefarious.
[01:10:48.532 --> 01:10:52.794]  It says, men 18 to 25 years, do the right thing, read it, fill it, mail it.
[01:10:53.114 --> 01:10:55.796]  I do want to tell you really quickly, because I know this is going to interest you.
[01:10:55.916 --> 01:10:58.858]  Um, the pictures they have on it, there's three boxes, right?
[01:10:59.298 --> 01:11:07.283]  One box, the first box has a giant eye casting a, like a triangular eye view scan or whatever.
[01:11:08.061 --> 01:11:11.703]  The second box has a pencil, but these are all caricatures, right?
[01:11:11.723 --> 01:11:19.026]  It has a pencil, supposedly filling out a form, and the third one has a hand delivering it in the mailbox.
[01:11:19.046 --> 01:11:23.068]  But anyway, the first one is a giant eye with a pyramid, obviously, right?
[01:11:23.108 --> 01:11:28.330]  And it's a symbol I've seen in reference to the Stasi in East Germany, but it's in caricature form.
[01:11:28.350 --> 01:11:29.351]  The second one, the pencil,
[01:11:29.844 --> 01:11:36.046]  When you turn it upside down, it's clearly a pyramid of the capstone, or if you want to use the pencil part, the wood part, it's also an obelisk.
[01:11:36.546 --> 01:11:37.646]  But this is very subtle.
[01:11:37.766 --> 01:11:38.586]  It's a caricature.
[01:11:38.626 --> 01:11:41.467]  But anyway, look, in the inside it says, will I be drafted?
[01:11:41.487 --> 01:11:43.728]  Well, it says several things, but one says, will I be drafted?
[01:11:44.248 --> 01:11:47.849]  It says, registering with Selective Service does not mean you are joining the military.
[01:11:48.489 --> 01:11:51.230]  The fact that a man is required to register does not mean that he will be drafted.
[01:11:51.550 --> 01:11:52.390]  Now, this is where it gets tricky.
[01:11:52.430 --> 01:11:53.511]  No one has been drafted since 1973.
[01:11:53.771 --> 01:11:54.451]  Here's the trick.
[01:11:55.231 --> 01:11:59.692]  No one can be drafted into the military unless ordered by Congress and the President.
[01:12:00.092 --> 01:12:04.293]  A draft would most likely occur only in the event of a war or national emergency.
[01:12:04.613 --> 01:12:06.414]  You see how the first contradicts the second part?
[01:12:06.454 --> 01:12:12.135]  It's like, oh, don't worry, you won't be drafted... But, but, but, there's probably going to be an emergency and then you will be.
[01:12:12.395 --> 01:12:13.295]  Well, that's what I'm saying.
[01:12:13.395 --> 01:12:14.915]  Like, the second part is so obvious.
[01:12:14.935 --> 01:12:17.536]  Come on, we're in a war and we just had a national emergency, like...
[01:12:17.976 --> 01:12:22.781]  New Orleans, and we've been in two wars, we're going into another one, national emergencies.
[01:12:22.921 --> 01:12:33.972]  Sir, sir, three years ago they set up, sir, they set up three years ago, they set up the draft boards again, the Army put out a report saying we're getting ready for a draft, then they had to retract it because of the hysteria.
[01:12:34.272 --> 01:12:38.877]  They've introduced three pieces of legislation currently in Congress for a total draft of men and women 18 to 49.
[01:12:40.490 --> 01:12:41.511]  It's ridiculous.
[01:12:41.871 --> 01:12:50.056]  And I show people this and it's funny because even... I mean, I try... I'm careful who I show the esoteric, sort of, occult, obvious symbolism with.
[01:12:50.277 --> 01:12:51.918]  But I just read what's inside.
[01:12:52.258 --> 01:12:54.359]  And it has a box that says a category.
[01:12:54.419 --> 01:12:58.082]  Who will be... It has a category of yes and no.
[01:12:58.242 --> 01:13:01.164]  Meaning, like, are these people required?
[01:13:01.844 --> 01:13:03.225]  And I'm going down.
[01:13:03.525 --> 01:13:03.946]  Let's see.
[01:13:04.066 --> 01:13:05.287]  Undocumented illegal aliens?
[01:13:05.387 --> 01:13:05.587]  Yes.
[01:13:06.624 --> 01:13:13.289]  They have to register for the, um, for the, uh, you know, whatever the draft, you know, special agricultural workers.
[01:13:13.309 --> 01:13:13.589]  Yes.
[01:13:14.290 --> 01:13:16.431]  Um, even like the handicapped physically or mentally.
[01:13:16.511 --> 01:13:16.791]  Yes.
[01:13:18.092 --> 01:13:19.333]  You know, all two seasons.
[01:13:19.373 --> 01:13:19.553]  Yes.
[01:13:19.653 --> 01:13:20.574]  Obviously national guys.
[01:13:20.634 --> 01:13:20.914]  Anyway.
[01:13:21.355 --> 01:13:22.856]  Um, there's only a few that it says no.
[01:13:23.056 --> 01:13:23.336]  Right.
[01:13:23.376 --> 01:13:27.259]  But by it's like mainly you gotta, I gotta send this to you.
[01:13:27.299 --> 01:13:29.360]  I presume that the address will send you something like this.
[01:13:29.400 --> 01:13:30.121]  Is that your website?
[01:13:30.401 --> 01:13:31.202]  Yes, it is.
[01:13:31.262 --> 01:13:31.582]  Okay.
[01:13:31.602 --> 01:13:34.504]  Cause you're going to really just, you have to, it's kind of, you have to see what it looks like.
[01:13:36.094 --> 01:13:36.514]  I hear you.
[01:13:36.594 --> 01:13:37.996]  I really appreciate your call.
[01:13:38.016 --> 01:13:40.739]  Yeah, and then this is what they do.
[01:13:40.799 --> 01:13:43.062]  They go, we're not planning this.
[01:13:43.102 --> 01:13:44.383]  There's no plan for amnesty.
[01:13:44.403 --> 01:13:45.444]  And then they pass amnesty.
[01:13:46.085 --> 01:13:51.671]  There's no plan for... Bush will not sign the campaign finance reform that restricts free speech.
[01:13:51.892 --> 01:13:52.572]  Then he passes it.
[01:13:53.333 --> 01:13:54.635]  There's no plan for a draft.
[01:13:54.695 --> 01:13:55.616]  No plan for a draft.
[01:13:56.115 --> 01:14:17.891]  They've just gotten record funding for selective service, and have introduced the bills, and have shut up the draft boards again, and then the Houston Chronicle reports that there's already a draft going on of people that have already been in the military who have select skills, and there's going to be a draft of special skills workers, and that there's a stopgap where they won't let people out who've already served their term, and they make them serve a third or fourth tour in Iraq.
[01:14:18.591 --> 01:14:22.554]  But there's not going to be a draft, as they make every preparation for it.
[01:14:23.937 --> 01:14:25.338]  As they get ready to attack Iran.
[01:14:25.418 --> 01:14:28.861]  Again, we never thought there'd be a draft, but luckily we had it all set up.
[01:14:29.161 --> 01:14:30.282]  We were hit by a nuke.
[01:14:30.342 --> 01:14:31.563]  We were hit by bird flu.
[01:14:32.124 --> 01:14:36.007]  And the new draft has it where the women mainly, and then many of the men.
[01:14:36.047 --> 01:14:39.109]  It'll be a huge draft of 5 million people they're talking about.
[01:14:39.650 --> 01:14:41.171]  Millions of those will stay at home.
[01:14:42.094 --> 01:14:43.375]  And a lot of them are going to like it.
[01:14:43.395 --> 01:15:00.770]  You're going to have a fancy uniform and strut around with a black beret and run checkpoints and aid the officers and they'll have PR firms on the TV about how handsome the men are and many women will, oh, oh, go to your homeland security commando, oh, oh.
[01:15:01.250 --> 01:15:10.718]  And they've been training a division of Secure Corps with the youth with M-16s and warrant service at schools across the country from Philadelphia to New York to California and L.A.
[01:15:11.926 --> 01:15:13.367]  I mean, it's happening, folks.
[01:15:13.387 --> 01:15:14.807]  You want to be a brown shirt nation?
[01:15:14.847 --> 01:15:16.928]  You want cameras with face scanners on every corner?
[01:15:17.428 --> 01:15:18.408]  You want to be drafted?
[01:15:18.468 --> 01:15:19.889]  You want to have your pension funds taken?
[01:15:20.169 --> 01:15:22.810]  You're going to get to enjoy it all, don't worry.
[01:15:23.350 --> 01:15:30.553]  They're probably going to win, and you're going to get to enjoy your George Bushy-Wushy, or maybe a Hillary, or maybe a Jebby-Webby.
[01:15:31.233 --> 01:15:32.534]  Alright, I'm getting sarcastic here.
[01:15:32.594 --> 01:15:35.457]  It's so sick to watch him kill this country.
[01:15:35.697 --> 01:15:38.860]  And you'll have an American Union, all the illegals legalized.
[01:15:38.880 --> 01:15:40.761]  It'll be so conservative.
[01:15:41.142 --> 01:15:44.524]  Let's go ahead and talk to Beth in Texas.
[01:15:44.565 --> 01:15:45.185]  Go ahead, Beth.
[01:15:45.826 --> 01:15:47.387]  Yeah, good afternoon, Alex.
[01:15:47.467 --> 01:15:48.508]  Thanks for taking my call.
[01:15:48.628 --> 01:15:49.048]  Thank you.
[01:15:50.510 --> 01:15:55.994]  You know, there's just so much to say about the subject and the topic in particular that you started out with.
[01:15:56.515 --> 01:15:58.416]  I don't even know where to start, to be honest with you.
[01:16:00.532 --> 01:16:10.986]  I guess a good place would be something that people may not be aware of is we did have a bit of a setback yesterday when the Supreme Court ruled that they would not upend the
[01:16:11.809 --> 01:16:14.712]  Yeah, I've got that from Reuters here.
[01:16:14.752 --> 01:16:15.693]  Let me just mention that.
[01:16:15.713 --> 01:16:16.735]  It's on the top of the stack.
[01:16:17.255 --> 01:16:19.558]  Court rules no whistleblower free speech right.
[01:16:19.598 --> 01:16:20.739]  Now, we've always had this.
[01:16:20.819 --> 01:16:22.321]  A closely divided U.S.
[01:16:22.341 --> 01:16:29.669]  Supreme Court ruled on Tuesday that government whistleblowers are not protected by free speech rights when they face employer discipline for trying to expose possible misconduct at work.
[01:16:30.009 --> 01:16:33.273]  They're openly saying they're not allowed to blow the whistle on crime.
[01:16:33.883 --> 01:16:44.469]  By a 5-4 vote, the High Court ruled against a Californian prosecutor who said he was demoted, denied a promotion, and transferred for trying to expose a lie by a county sheriff's deputy in a search warrant affidavit.
[01:16:44.769 --> 01:16:51.673]  So they're saying you're not allowed to expose crime or corruption, and you will be demoted, and they are allowed to abuse you, and you're not allowed to defend yourself.
[01:16:52.634 --> 01:16:53.374]  Right, correct.
[01:16:53.434 --> 01:16:55.915]  And Mr. Russell Price is a perfect example of that.
[01:16:56.916 --> 01:17:00.318]  The senior intelligence officer for the NSA,
[01:17:01.246 --> 01:17:03.069]  He was recently demoted back in 2005 in December.
[01:17:06.710 --> 01:17:13.013]  He submitted a report that one of his fellow colleagues was suspected of spying for China.
[01:17:13.293 --> 01:17:15.814]  And they're talking about firing AT&T employees.
[01:17:15.834 --> 01:17:20.036]  They're talking about how the NSA runs a whole floor of every major AT&T building.
[01:17:20.756 --> 01:17:21.136]  That's correct.
[01:17:21.176 --> 01:17:22.337]  When that's already public.
[01:17:22.517 --> 01:17:26.919]  And they're talking about indicting people that have leaked White House memos about Bush crimes.
[01:17:27.279 --> 01:17:28.059]  Yeah, openly.
[01:17:28.119 --> 01:17:32.101]  You release stuff about a crime, you're going to lose your job, you're going to go to jail.
[01:17:32.701 --> 01:17:33.201]  That's right.
[01:17:33.261 --> 01:17:34.082]  Not to mention that
[01:17:35.094 --> 01:17:39.918]  Walmart Incorporated has a Homeland Security office within their headquarters.
[01:17:40.278 --> 01:17:42.800]  That is confirmed, up in Fayetteville, Arkansas.
[01:17:43.460 --> 01:17:54.228]  Well, and I've, sadly to say, I've worked in one of their distribution centers, and I can no longer do, thank God, but did long enough to see for myself that it is in fact set up for that purpose.
[01:17:55.228 --> 01:17:57.590]  It's really a government, it's really a government front.
[01:17:57.630 --> 01:17:59.371]  Why don't, you want to comment on that for us?
[01:18:01.373 --> 01:18:02.634]  You mean from personal experience?
[01:18:02.674 --> 01:18:02.874]  Yes.
[01:18:03.992 --> 01:18:06.654]  Other than say it's like a concentration camp.
[01:18:06.774 --> 01:18:10.357]  It's the most hellish place on earth that you can earn a paycheck from.
[01:18:10.377 --> 01:18:19.123]  I think people just need to come out of their warm and cozy little environments.
[01:18:19.423 --> 01:18:21.424]  Because I assure you that that's temporary.
[01:18:22.005 --> 01:18:26.227]  It may feel good now, but it's going away very soon as Alex has said.
[01:18:27.108 --> 01:18:32.912]  Well it's like a sheep or a hog or a chicken you're fattening up for slaughter.
[01:18:33.690 --> 01:18:34.131]  Exactly.
[01:18:34.171 --> 01:18:37.313]  Everybody's in their cages braying and squawking and bawking.
[01:18:37.373 --> 01:18:38.314]  Oh, they love it.
[01:18:38.774 --> 01:18:40.756]  They love the heaters in the slaughterhouse.
[01:18:40.836 --> 01:18:41.937]  It keeps them warm.
[01:18:42.197 --> 01:18:44.419]  The government gives us grain.
[01:18:44.779 --> 01:18:45.840]  Anything else you want to add?
[01:18:46.381 --> 01:18:47.341]  I do, if you'll hold me up.
[01:18:47.361 --> 01:18:47.922]  Yeah, stay there.
[01:18:48.422 --> 01:18:49.503]  Yeah, I'm glad you mentioned this.
[01:18:49.563 --> 01:18:50.324]  I meant to get to it.
[01:18:50.364 --> 01:18:51.164]  Yeah, you know.
[01:18:51.905 --> 01:18:52.786]  There's no whistleblowing.
[01:18:52.826 --> 01:18:53.226]  It's freedom.
[01:18:56.229 --> 01:18:58.410]  Do you know the truth about breast cancer?
[01:18:58.470 --> 01:19:00.212]  Did you know that the race for the cure is over?
[01:19:01.383 --> 01:19:09.255]  The best-kept secret in the country today is that it is now possible to kill cancer without personal suffering, mutilation, and poisoning of your entire system.
[01:19:09.495 --> 01:19:13.521]  Now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaysMedInc's patented methodology.

[01:19:57.466 --> 01:19:59.906]  The most comprehensive edition ever published.

[01:20:55.051 --> 01:20:59.553]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[01:20:59.893 --> 01:21:03.975]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[01:21:04.275 --> 01:21:04.835]  We listened.
[01:21:05.135 --> 01:21:10.117]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[01:21:10.397 --> 01:21:10.878]  We listened.
[01:21:11.258 --> 01:21:14.299]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[01:21:14.719 --> 01:21:15.259]  We listened.
[01:21:15.720 --> 01:21:19.061]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power
[01:21:19.121 --> 01:21:19.682]  We're good to go.
[01:21:49.262 --> 01:21:57.705]  Do you remember when you could eat most anything and not worry about it?
[01:21:58.185 --> 01:22:00.365]  Or maybe weight management has always been a problem?
[01:22:00.866 --> 01:22:06.248]  Are you frustrated, burned out, and tired of fad diets and marketing gimmicks that don't really work?
[01:22:06.768 --> 01:22:12.650]  Do you want a proven system, a long-term solution, to live a healthier lifestyle and properly manage your weight?

[01:23:05.262 --> 01:23:10.750]  We've had it too good too long, we're spoiled rotten, we're propagandized, and we're going into slavery right now.
[01:23:11.730 --> 01:23:16.314]  We can stop it if you wake up to it and look around you, but the sun's shining.
[01:23:16.374 --> 01:23:17.315]  It's a pretty day out there.
[01:23:17.335 --> 01:23:18.456]  That's a point I've always made.
[01:23:18.476 --> 01:23:25.162]  That Russian emigre we were interviewing yesterday about growing up in the Soviet Union talked about how everything still looked normal there, but they were living under tyranny.
[01:23:25.422 --> 01:23:26.423]  It's the same thing here.
[01:23:26.463 --> 01:23:27.664]  It's happening right now.
[01:23:28.065 --> 01:23:29.346]  They want to go after free speech.
[01:23:29.366 --> 01:23:30.567]  They want to take all of our freedoms.
[01:23:31.007 --> 01:23:33.630]  Beth in Texas, then Matt, Bill, Paula, Al, and others.
[01:23:34.391 --> 01:23:35.792]  Go ahead, Beth, and finish up your points.
[01:23:36.414 --> 01:23:36.854]  Okay.
[01:23:37.795 --> 01:23:40.436]  I just want to make a comment about the Georgia Guidestones.
[01:23:40.596 --> 01:23:43.017]  I'm sure you've mentioned this before on your program.
[01:23:44.098 --> 01:23:46.979]  I wonder how many people have ever heard of the Georgia Guidestones.
[01:23:47.159 --> 01:23:50.781]  Put up by the Masons, saying they're going to kill 80% of us.
[01:23:51.521 --> 01:23:55.083]  Well, what they are is the New Ten Commandments, which we'll be following.
[01:23:55.103 --> 01:24:02.306]  You can forget, for those that read and follow the Bible, the Scriptures, you can forget the Ten Commandments that are referenced there.
[01:24:03.021 --> 01:24:08.744]  You might want to check out your new Ten Commandments that will be in force very soon with all that's going to happen.
[01:24:10.005 --> 01:24:19.690]  You know, Alex, first I should have started out when you took my call by saying I believe you, as many Americans do believe, that you're a true American hero.
[01:24:20.990 --> 01:24:31.356]  All the sacrifices, personally, financially, on every front that you make for all of us, not for yourself only, but for everyone, I commend you for it.
[01:24:32.519 --> 01:24:34.020]  Listen, I don't need to be commended.
[01:24:34.040 --> 01:24:35.320]  I know the cost.
[01:24:35.460 --> 01:24:36.500]  I know what we're facing.
[01:24:36.600 --> 01:24:37.541]  I see it clearly.
[01:24:37.561 --> 01:24:39.641]  All I can do is fight.
[01:24:39.701 --> 01:24:40.782]  I'm consumed with fighting.
[01:24:41.142 --> 01:24:44.303]  We're dealing with psychopathic, murdering killers.
[01:24:46.804 --> 01:24:47.464]  We've got to fight them.
[01:24:48.304 --> 01:24:50.105]  You hit the nail on the head.
[01:24:50.165 --> 01:24:52.085]  That's all we can do.
[01:24:52.505 --> 01:24:56.307]  Like so many others, I myself went through the different stages of denial.
[01:24:56.327 --> 01:25:00.588]  The first thing was to run and hide and bury myself in the ground.
[01:25:01.206 --> 01:25:06.048]  But then one has to think, and this goes out to all those that are, you know, in that mode of survival.
[01:25:06.769 --> 01:25:08.109]  What are you going to do when you come out?
[01:25:08.670 --> 01:25:12.551]  Do you want to live in that world that you will be coming out into?
[01:25:13.252 --> 01:25:14.832]  Because my answer is no.
[01:25:15.373 --> 01:25:16.793]  I don't have any choice but to fight.
[01:25:17.013 --> 01:25:19.575]  Well, I appreciate your call, Beth, and those are wonderful words.
[01:25:19.655 --> 01:25:22.696]  You know, so many of us are taught to live in the moment, only care about now.
[01:25:23.196 --> 01:25:26.578]  You have to know the past, you have to look at the future, and that will make your now better.
[01:25:27.483 --> 01:25:32.024]  I mean, we didn't build this country because people were stupid and laid down to corruption.
[01:25:33.025 --> 01:25:35.506]  Four percent of the world's population had half the wealth.
[01:25:35.546 --> 01:25:42.208]  We're now losing it because, by and large, we were smarter, more active, more aggressive, more freedom-oriented than anybody else.
[01:25:42.648 --> 01:25:43.908]  Liberty brings plenty.
[01:25:44.008 --> 01:25:45.149]  Plenty brings decadence.
[01:25:45.509 --> 01:25:46.509]  It then brings corruption.
[01:25:46.549 --> 01:25:47.770]  It then brings enslavement.
[01:25:48.810 --> 01:25:50.971]  We're coming into the bottom of that cycle right now.
[01:25:51.611 --> 01:25:53.571]  Let's go ahead and talk to Matt.
[01:25:54.312 --> 01:25:55.372]  Matt, where are you calling us from?
[01:25:58.929 --> 01:26:00.130]  Thanks for taking my call.
[01:26:00.150 --> 01:26:01.111]  I really appreciate it, Alex.
[01:26:01.752 --> 01:26:03.934]  I've got two quick questions and I'll hang up and let you answer.
[01:26:03.954 --> 01:26:05.495]  It's about Building 7.
[01:26:06.896 --> 01:26:11.640]  We all know, you actually just had a story about the Danish press saying that it had to come down.
[01:26:12.290 --> 01:26:17.473]  I'm wondering if you think that perhaps it was supposed to be hit by a plane, maybe 93?
[01:26:17.813 --> 01:26:19.394]  Well, see, I don't want to speculate.
[01:26:19.414 --> 01:26:19.974]  We don't know.
[01:26:19.994 --> 01:26:21.055]  We just know they blew it up.
[01:26:21.495 --> 01:26:23.656]  We can say, was 93 really going there?
[01:26:24.136 --> 01:26:26.998]  My info is it was going to the Capitol, but we just know they blew it up.
[01:26:27.618 --> 01:26:33.221]  It's always great to speculate, but we really can't do that because we just need to stick to what we know.
[01:26:33.241 --> 01:26:33.981]  We know they blew it up.
[01:26:34.602 --> 01:26:35.522]  Absolutely.
[01:26:35.762 --> 01:26:40.625]  Was there anything that came out about the so-called 5th and 6th planes that were to be hijacked that day?
[01:26:41.690 --> 01:26:44.652]  We know there was other planes on the ground, people being grabbed off of them.
[01:26:44.692 --> 01:26:45.392]  We don't know, sir.
[01:26:46.093 --> 01:26:49.555]  Most of the focus by the truth movement is on that stuff.
[01:26:50.075 --> 01:26:53.337]  I just stick to all the things we can prove, and you look at those, the government did it.
[01:26:53.937 --> 01:26:54.457]  Absolutely.
[01:26:55.038 --> 01:26:55.638]  Last question.
[01:26:56.479 --> 01:26:57.959]  Did you ever get a chance to meet Bill Hicks?
[01:26:58.780 --> 01:26:59.961]  And you have a great day, sir.
[01:26:59.981 --> 01:27:00.501]  Yeah, thank you.
[01:27:00.941 --> 01:27:02.502]  I met him, I think, three times.
[01:27:03.683 --> 01:27:04.503]  Alright, that's awesome.
[01:27:04.883 --> 01:27:05.644]  Yeah, thank you.
[01:27:05.684 --> 01:27:07.505]  Contrary to popular belief, we were not good friends.
[01:27:08.622 --> 01:27:11.444]  I was just in Austin to get to know people.
[01:27:11.784 --> 01:27:14.005]  I'd been there a few years before Bill died.
[01:27:15.426 --> 01:27:17.427]  I'm good friends with his best friend.
[01:27:17.867 --> 01:27:20.949]  So I did meet Bill a few times, but I was not good friends with Bill Hicks.
[01:27:20.989 --> 01:27:24.131]  People say I was, and they say all this stuff.
[01:27:25.071 --> 01:27:28.893]  There are websites that attack me and tell other lies about me, and they say I'm friends with Bill Hicks.
[01:27:29.394 --> 01:27:30.494]  I don't see that as an attack.
[01:27:30.534 --> 01:27:32.715]  He was a very smart individual, very talented.
[01:27:32.775 --> 01:27:33.736]  It's just not true.
[01:27:34.711 --> 01:27:35.932]  We're going to break and come back.
[01:27:35.972 --> 01:27:37.452]  Let's get another call in right now.
[01:27:37.532 --> 01:27:38.313]  Bill in Nebraska.
[01:27:38.353 --> 01:27:39.113]  Bill, you're on the air.
[01:27:39.593 --> 01:27:40.674]  Yeah, Alex.
[01:27:41.674 --> 01:27:47.597]  Keeping with your talk about foodstuffs, I believe that it's a senator in Wisconsin.
[01:27:47.677 --> 01:27:55.361]  I'm not positive on that, but he's trying to pass a bill declaring cow manure as toxic waste.
[01:27:55.661 --> 01:28:02.604]  Yes, there's a bunch of stuff to start taxing and regulating and Big Agra is actually funding all that to shut down the family farms.
[01:28:03.129 --> 01:28:14.995]  Well now, if they pass a bill making cow manure toxic waste, but yet there's no bill to stop them from feeding chicken droppings to cows, which fosters mad cow disease.
[01:28:16.636 --> 01:28:17.656]  Sir, the Animal I.D.
[01:28:17.816 --> 01:28:22.679]  Act, all of it, is written by big industry to shut down the small industries.
[01:28:23.991 --> 01:28:26.673]  That's what this would do, it would shut down organic farming.
[01:28:26.713 --> 01:28:30.056]  Sir, it's an attack on everything American, everything independent.
[01:28:30.576 --> 01:28:33.218]  The country is literally being dismantled in front of us.
[01:28:33.679 --> 01:28:43.606]  Because we know that those chemical fertilizers that they're going to force people to use, since you can't have organic farming anymore... Very toxic, very toxic, we'll be right back.
[01:28:44.247 --> 01:28:47.229]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:28:48.150 --> 01:28:50.812]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.816 --> 01:29:02.350]  According to a recent report by the National Institute of Health, high blood pressure is a major risk factor for heart disease and the chief risk factor for stroke and heart failure.
[01:29:02.571 --> 01:29:04.394]  It affects about 50 million Americans.
[01:29:04.594 --> 01:29:05.736]  That's one in four adults.
[01:29:06.107 --> 01:29:12.191]  Because many people have high blood pressure for years without knowing it, the American Heart Association calls it the silent killer.
[01:29:12.471 --> 01:29:16.134]  At ResearchedHerbs.com, we recognize your concern for your well-being.
[01:29:16.434 --> 01:29:23.399]  As your online partner in health, we are committed to empowering you with the resources you need to make informed health decisions about high blood pressure.
[01:29:23.619 --> 01:29:27.622]  Visit us online at ResearchedHerbs.com to learn more about heart care.
[01:29:27.902 --> 01:29:33.264]  The widely researched natural herbal supplement for regulating blood pressure and maintaining optimum heart health.
[01:29:33.584 --> 01:29:39.646]  Did you know that the safety and effectiveness of heart care is backed by over a hundred clinical trials and experimental studies?
[01:29:40.046 --> 01:29:40.486]  Act now!
[01:29:40.606 --> 01:29:46.448]  Visit us online at researchedherbs.com or call us at 1-800-845-3841 to start protecting yourself from the silent killer.
[01:29:46.548 --> 01:29:46.748]  That's 1-800-845-3841.
[01:29:53.750 --> 01:29:56.753]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[01:29:57.073 --> 01:30:01.997]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[01:30:02.258 --> 01:30:06.621]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[01:30:06.902 --> 01:30:15.830]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[01:30:16.030 --> 01:30:19.653]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[01:30:19.933 --> 01:30:24.957]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[01:30:25.257 --> 01:30:32.003]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[01:30:32.483 --> 01:30:33.024]  What about you?
[01:30:33.772 --> 01:30:39.135]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.
[01:30:39.175 --> 01:30:40.335]  Call now to order at 1-888-803-4438.
[01:30:40.355 --> 01:30:42.236]  Order today and save $14 by calling 1-888-803-4438.
[01:30:53.405 --> 01:30:57.847]  If you think your engine is safe by having the oil changed every 3,000 miles, think again.
[01:30:58.127 --> 01:31:01.709]  Every time you start your car, your engine creates friction between the moving parts.
[01:31:01.869 --> 01:31:09.992]  These moving parts wear against each other, and the result is small metal particles circulating through your oil, causing premature wear and damage to your engine.
[01:31:10.232 --> 01:31:15.875]  Oil filters do a good job of trapping the large metal particles, but they will not trap the most harmful tiny particles.
[01:31:16.175 --> 01:31:21.419]  These tiny particles circulate constantly through your oil, and over time your engine begins to show signs of wear.
[01:31:21.679 --> 01:31:23.761]  This is why you need the Filter Mag.
[01:31:24.021 --> 01:31:36.191]  The Filter Mag is a powerful magnet that holds itself to the outside of your oil filter, trapping the tiny metal particles to the inside wall of the filter, extending the life of your oil and ultimately extending the life of your engine.
[01:31:36.411 --> 01:31:40.833]  The reusable FilterMag is maintenance-free, installs in two seconds, and lasts forever.
[01:31:41.053 --> 01:31:42.013]  So what are you waiting for?
[01:31:42.173 --> 01:31:43.814]  Go to FilterMag.com.
[01:31:43.934 --> 01:31:45.734]  That's FilterMag.com.
[01:31:45.974 --> 01:31:46.454]  Or call 800-345-8376.
[01:31:46.494 --> 01:31:46.675]  That's 800-345-8376.
[01:31:46.695 --> 01:31:47.895]  1-800-259-9231 is the toll-free number to join us on air.
[01:32:09.335 --> 01:32:10.796]  We've had so many requests to do it.
[01:32:10.816 --> 01:32:22.060]  I'm going to re-air in the next hour the Monday interview with Ray McGovern, a high-level CIA analyst, former CIA analyst, exposing the upcoming World War III with Iran, breaking down all the facets of it.
[01:32:22.080 --> 01:32:23.941]  We'll continue with calls throughout this hour.
[01:32:23.961 --> 01:32:25.921]  I've got a few other key news items I want to hit.
[01:32:27.442 --> 01:32:31.583]  And we'll be talking to Paula and Al and others here in just a few minutes.
[01:32:32.024 --> 01:32:35.625]  I want to encourage you to come to our big 9-11 symposium, unlike any other.
[01:32:36.661 --> 01:32:42.346]  Coming up in June 24th and 25th, now what, 24 days away, the tickets are going fast.
[01:32:42.386 --> 01:32:45.429]  Get them at InfoWars.com or by calling 1-888-253-3139.
[01:32:45.609 --> 01:32:51.574]  It's going to be absolutely amazing.
[01:32:51.975 --> 01:32:54.977]  We've got Ray McGovern coming to expose 9-11 as an inside job.
[01:32:55.037 --> 01:32:58.220]  Professor Steven Jones to expose 9-11 as an inside job.
[01:32:58.260 --> 01:32:58.981]  Jim Fetzer.
[01:32:59.827 --> 01:33:02.048]  We're going to have so many others.
[01:33:02.068 --> 01:33:09.171]  We're going to have one of the survivors of the World Trade Center collapse, the hero, William Rodriguez, who helped people get out of the building with the firemen.
[01:33:09.691 --> 01:33:11.072]  Jimmy Walter is going to be there.
[01:33:11.892 --> 01:33:14.753]  We're going to have author Webster Tarpley there.
[01:33:15.474 --> 01:33:17.795]  Dylan Avery of Loose Change Second Edition will be there.
[01:33:17.835 --> 01:33:20.076]  I'll be premiering my new film, Terror Storm.
[01:33:20.096 --> 01:33:25.638]  Of course, I'll give really two speeches during the 20 hours that we're going to have on Saturday and Sunday.
[01:33:25.958 --> 01:33:28.039]  Get your tickets now at InfoWars.com.
[01:33:28.539 --> 01:33:34.464]  Or prisonplanet.com or by calling toll free 1-888-253-3139.
[01:33:34.784 --> 01:33:36.966]  Learn more about the conference, learn all the details.
[01:33:37.766 --> 01:33:39.928]  They're on the website right now.
[01:33:41.269 --> 01:33:42.790]  Please take action and join us there.
[01:33:43.171 --> 01:33:44.071]  It's going to be historic.
[01:33:44.091 --> 01:33:46.113]  We'll have time for questions and answers after each speaker.
[01:33:46.373 --> 01:33:47.674]  It's going to be unbelievably good.
[01:33:47.694 --> 01:33:49.596]  There will also be a surprise guest.
[01:33:49.616 --> 01:33:50.877]  You can probably guess who that's going to be.
[01:33:50.897 --> 01:33:53.759]  A surprise guest will be speaking as well.
[01:33:54.660 --> 01:33:56.581]  We'll announce that a few days before the event.
[01:33:56.701 --> 01:33:57.662]  You'll hear about it, believe me.
[01:33:59.708 --> 01:34:04.130]  For about five minutes or so, I want to get them back up again because it's so exciting.
[01:34:04.991 --> 01:34:11.314]  You can't just listen to us on the big ABC feed that we lease on the big ABC satellite.
[01:34:11.334 --> 01:34:12.634]  That's a big 15-foot dish.
[01:34:12.734 --> 01:34:13.535]  Most of you don't have that.
[01:34:13.935 --> 01:34:16.256]  You can listen on the internet or local Aminathem affiliates.
[01:34:17.957 --> 01:34:19.298]  You can listen on the internet.
[01:34:19.338 --> 01:34:24.880]  But you can also listen on a little, what, 33, 32-inch dish that comes in crystal clear.
[01:34:24.920 --> 01:34:26.441]  We use this now here in the office.
[01:34:27.099 --> 01:34:28.520]  To stream our own internet feed.
[01:34:28.820 --> 01:34:32.483]  We pick it up off the satellite and then restream it to you as a backup for the internet.
[01:34:32.984 --> 01:34:34.525]  And we've had nothing but success with this.
[01:34:34.565 --> 01:34:35.566]  It's been so wonderful.
[01:34:36.026 --> 01:34:37.688]  And I'm not selling this.
[01:34:37.728 --> 01:34:38.909]  I don't get a dime from this.
[01:34:39.729 --> 01:34:46.435]  I'm plugging this because you get like a hundred channels of TV and radio all over the world.
[01:34:46.535 --> 01:34:47.375]  So much neat stuff.
[01:34:47.876 --> 01:34:48.897]  And there's not a subscription.
[01:34:48.937 --> 01:34:50.798]  You buy the satellite dish and the receiver.
[01:34:50.818 --> 01:34:54.581]  It only takes, what, 30 minutes, I guess, to put up on your house.
[01:34:55.182 --> 01:34:55.782]  And boom!
[01:34:55.822 --> 01:34:56.783]  You're tuned into the world.
[01:34:57.429 --> 01:35:07.425]  And you can buy a fancier receiver if you want and get, I guess, hundreds and hundreds of more channels, but for $169 you get so much, including this network, the GCN Radio Network.
[01:35:08.064 --> 01:35:10.967]  And so Rick Kahler of Rick's Satellites joins us.
[01:35:11.067 --> 01:35:12.268]  Rick, thanks for coming on with us.
[01:35:12.708 --> 01:35:17.413]  Alex, thank you so much for having me back on your show again and thanks for what you continue to do for us all.
[01:35:17.733 --> 01:35:19.595]  Did you get a big response last time coming on?
[01:35:19.975 --> 01:35:21.677]  Yes, you made the phones light up.
[01:35:21.717 --> 01:35:33.808]  You've got a lot of faithful, loyal listeners who sometimes have trouble hearing the show over shortwave as it will tend to fade in and out and occasionally they might lose their connection on the internet.
[01:35:34.562 --> 01:35:37.663]  So this is an alternative way to pick you up.
[01:35:37.963 --> 01:35:47.387]  And not only your live show, I don't know if I mentioned it, but on one of the channels we have you on, we also have a replay of your three hours from 6 p.m.
[01:35:47.427 --> 01:35:48.367]  to 9 p.m.
[01:35:49.007 --> 01:35:52.048]  And on another channel, we're putting you back up from 3 a.m.
[01:35:52.068 --> 01:35:52.469]  to 6 a.m.
[01:35:54.395 --> 01:36:03.084]  So if the folks are not home or don't have the VCR set to get your show, we do have it replayed a couple times too because it's awful important to get it out there.
[01:36:03.344 --> 01:36:03.845]  Absolutely.
[01:36:03.885 --> 01:36:06.587]  Tell folks about the dish and the receiver and how people can get it.
[01:36:07.148 --> 01:36:14.475]  Well, as a special for the Alex Jones listeners, we're going ahead and continuing the price package that we put together of $169.
[01:36:16.997 --> 01:36:21.379]  Rick Satellite, myself, have teamed up with Todd Waite of Global Star Radio.
[01:36:21.760 --> 01:36:23.540]  He's at GSRadio.net.
[01:36:23.880 --> 01:36:29.543]  He's actually the gentleman that is in charge of uplinking the signals to the satellite.
[01:36:30.083 --> 01:36:32.124]  And what we have is a satellite dish.
[01:36:32.144 --> 01:36:33.825]  We call it a 76 centimeter.
[01:36:33.865 --> 01:36:36.886]  It actually measures about 30 by 33 inches.
[01:36:37.647 --> 01:36:43.990]  And you aim that at a satellite that's called Telstar 5, or it's also referred to as Intellisat Americas 5.
[01:36:45.230 --> 01:36:52.553]  And aim it in at that satellite and then run a cable from the dish to your satellite receiver and hook it up to your TV set.
[01:36:53.133 --> 01:36:59.755]  And there we have six different channels of Patriot Talk radio shows, most importantly featuring the Alex Jones Show.
[01:37:00.836 --> 01:37:09.099]  Other channels that are also available on there from the GCN lineup would be, let's see, Dave and Joyce from the Power Hour.
[01:37:09.119 --> 01:37:12.820]  Also have on Pastor Butch Paul with Call to Decision.
[01:37:13.616 --> 01:37:28.387]  Some of the other channels, we have Jeff Rents, Steve Quell, Gary Brownfield, Kevin Smith, Culture Shock, Dr. Stan Monteith, Stan Solomon, Scriptures for America, just to name a few.
[01:37:28.427 --> 01:37:29.888]  So, we've got six different channels.
[01:37:29.928 --> 01:37:35.852]  So, when you're not on, Alex, they can actually get a different flavor of some of the other folks as well.
[01:37:35.932 --> 01:37:36.492]  Absolutely.
[01:37:37.033 --> 01:37:41.256]  Now, on InfoWars.com, right on the main page on the left-hand side,
[01:37:42.145 --> 01:37:44.967]  It says listen to Alex in crystal clear audio quality.
[01:37:45.548 --> 01:37:49.611]  That's the link to the Alex Jones special on your site.
[01:37:49.931 --> 01:37:54.895]  But specifically, give us the website several times and give us the number to call to get one of these units.
[01:37:55.395 --> 01:37:57.417]  Okay, my phone number Alex is area code 816-228-1801.
[01:37:57.457 --> 01:38:00.139]  And my website, it's all one word, GoFastMotorsports.com.
[01:38:09.813 --> 01:38:15.256]  That telephone number is 816-228-1801.
[01:38:15.896 --> 01:38:19.497]  And the website is GoFastMotorsports.com.
[01:38:20.138 --> 01:38:27.941]  I've had several folks call and say, man, I was just able to run to the desk and get a pen and paper and write down that phone number.
[01:38:27.981 --> 01:38:30.342]  I could hardly hear it, but I got just the number.
[01:38:30.362 --> 01:38:31.983]  And they call and start inquiring about it.
[01:38:32.403 --> 01:38:36.625]  A lot of them have gotten the system, and they've called back, and they're thrilled with the reception.
[01:38:38.467 --> 01:38:40.589]  Crystal clear digital audio.
[01:38:41.469 --> 01:38:42.570]  So we're real pleased about it.
[01:38:42.590 --> 01:38:45.873]  That number is 816-228-1801.
[01:38:46.313 --> 01:38:50.977]  The basic system is $169 including the shipping cost.
[01:38:51.497 --> 01:38:55.521]  And once you install the system, there is no charge for the programming.
[01:38:55.801 --> 01:38:58.503]  We want to help to do what we can to get your message out.
[01:38:59.324 --> 01:39:02.046]  One of the neat things about it is because of the size of the dish,
[01:39:02.765 --> 01:39:10.491]  Even in a homeowner's restricted area, where they're trying to say, well, you can't have a satellite dish in here, you know, we want everything to look just this way.
[01:39:10.832 --> 01:39:14.134]  Well, they cannot legally tell you, you cannot have this dish.
[01:39:14.514 --> 01:39:19.859]  As long as it's one meter in size or smaller, they cannot keep you from having this dish.
[01:39:20.379 --> 01:39:27.127]  And it's under one meter, it's 76 centimeters, so you can put this up even in the so-called homeowner's restricted areas.
[01:39:27.568 --> 01:39:37.800]  Well, also, we're on a lot of commercial AM and FM stations, but we're also on a lot of quote, micros, known by the mainstream media as pirates, and we've got Texas Renegade Radio.
[01:39:38.954 --> 01:39:52.920]  Now over, I think, 12 transmitters in other states now, and a lot of people are using these dishes to refeed, or somebody can buy a 1 watt transmitter and just transmit to 3 or 4 neighborhoods with one of these and use this as the feed as well.
[01:39:53.664 --> 01:39:54.144]  Absolutely.
[01:39:54.204 --> 01:40:07.249]  I've got a couple of farmers that actually micro-broadcast for their neighbors as well as so they can go out while they're working in the fields all day and still listening to the programs while they're out in the combine or working outside.
[01:40:07.529 --> 01:40:08.110]  Exactly.
[01:40:08.390 --> 01:40:16.873]  And those small units that are a water sower, very, very inexpensive, very, very easy to hook up to this satellite dish running antenna up on top of the house.
[01:40:18.219 --> 01:40:23.265]  Well listen, give that number out one more time, Rick, and give that website out again.
[01:40:23.625 --> 01:40:34.658]  Okay, the phone number, I'm in Missouri, the phone number is 816-228-1801, and on the internet it's GoFastMotorsports.com.
[01:40:35.518 --> 01:40:39.682]  Right on the top of the page, it's got a link that says Global Star Satellite Systems.
[01:40:40.222 --> 01:40:44.746]  There, that'll take you to a page where we've got basically three systems we've put together.
[01:40:44.806 --> 01:40:48.069]  The basic stand-alone system, just to aim at the one satellite.
[01:40:48.990 --> 01:40:57.318]  On that satellite, besides the six channels of the Patriot Talk Radio, there are, as you mentioned, over a hundred TV stations from all around the world.
[01:40:57.778 --> 01:41:00.901]  Also, some stations in English, religious stations.
[01:41:01.782 --> 01:41:05.246]  Smile of God, Daystar, Trinity the Word Network, and so on.
[01:41:05.627 --> 01:41:14.277]  On the radio side, another 65 or so foreign channels, 30 CD music channels, commercial free, and then of course the talk radio channels.
[01:41:14.697 --> 01:41:16.920]  We also put together a motorized system.
[01:41:16.980 --> 01:41:22.366]  If you want to put a motor on that dish and use the receiver and remote control to move the dish around to pick up
[01:41:22.987 --> 01:41:25.389]  Lots of different channels from other satellites.
[01:41:25.589 --> 01:41:35.819]  It's a lot more complicated to install, so you might need professional installation or a little background with the satellites to know what you're doing if you're going to put up a motorized system.
[01:41:35.899 --> 01:41:37.140]  But it's really easy with a $169 model.
[01:41:37.160 --> 01:41:40.183]  The standalone system is a lot easier to put up.
[01:41:40.283 --> 01:41:40.623]  Okay.
[01:41:40.663 --> 01:41:42.385]  Well, thank you so much, Rick, for coming on.
[01:41:42.405 --> 01:41:43.385]  I'm excited about this.
[01:41:43.766 --> 01:41:44.547]  Our listeners love it.
[01:41:45.027 --> 01:41:46.028]  Thank you so much, Alex.
[01:41:46.308 --> 01:41:46.648]  You bet.
[01:41:46.668 --> 01:41:47.069]  Take care.
[01:41:47.745 --> 01:41:48.585]  It's exciting, folks.
[01:41:48.605 --> 01:41:50.586]  We've got a link to it up on InfoWars.com.
[01:41:50.626 --> 01:41:51.687]  Let's go back to the callers.
[01:41:51.707 --> 01:41:53.847]  We're talking about the attack on Iran.
[01:41:54.147 --> 01:41:55.208]  They're saying they're going to do it.
[01:41:55.608 --> 01:41:56.868]  They're moving forward to do it.
[01:41:57.028 --> 01:41:57.709]  It's crazy.
[01:41:57.749 --> 01:41:59.529]  It'll cause all sorts of global problems.
[01:42:00.010 --> 01:42:03.191]  We're also, I mean, you can't even state how bad it is.
[01:42:03.591 --> 01:42:04.311]  It's impossible.
[01:42:04.751 --> 01:42:09.453]  And then at the same time, we've got all of the other toxic things in our environment.
[01:42:10.694 --> 01:42:14.435]  Just the insanity of this elite, the things that they're taking
[01:42:16.048 --> 01:42:19.411]  Action on the things they're setting up are even hurting their own families.
[01:42:19.431 --> 01:42:20.752]  I mean, why are they doing this?
[01:42:21.392 --> 01:42:27.017]  Let's go ahead and talk to Paula in Florida, then Al, Alfred, and others.
[01:42:27.257 --> 01:42:28.177]  You're on the air, Paula.
[01:42:28.438 --> 01:42:29.038]  Hi, Alex.
[01:42:29.579 --> 01:42:32.321]  The thing about this satellite is really great.
[01:42:32.341 --> 01:42:36.424]  This thing about what Alito did with the free speech thing,
[01:42:37.344 --> 01:42:41.586]  Yes, saying no more whistleblowing, none of you are protected, there's no more free speech.
[01:42:41.626 --> 01:42:44.107]  You have to be quiet about criminal activity in government.
[01:42:44.347 --> 01:42:48.329]  Yeah, people need to call the Judicial Qualification Board and have him removed.
[01:42:48.349 --> 01:42:57.813]  Because he's violated his constitutional... Well, I mean, the Supreme Court ruled that they can take our private property if a private interest wants it without just compensation.
[01:42:58.093 --> 01:42:58.834]  Thanks for the call.
[01:42:59.534 --> 01:43:01.795]  Let's go ahead and talk to Al in California.
[01:43:01.915 --> 01:43:02.735]  Al, you're on the air.
[01:43:04.536 --> 01:43:05.737]  Hey, Alex, how you doing?
[01:43:05.817 --> 01:43:06.097]  Good, sir.
[01:43:07.350 --> 01:43:08.091]  Uh, two points.
[01:43:08.231 --> 01:43:17.317]  I'll do the less important one first, but anyways, whatever happened to that guy who invented the device that could see through the ground and you had him on the air a few months ago?
[01:43:18.838 --> 01:43:35.048]  Well, I don't remember that, but I mean, they've got ground penetrating radar that looks right through your walls of your house, mounted on police helicopters in several major cities we know of, and they have a lot of other similar and even more powerful systems that the military has, so we know that exists, but
[01:43:36.058 --> 01:43:50.565]  Yeah, I was thinking, you know, because I remember you had him on the air and you were talking about making the point how his device was much more elegant in a way in which it achieved, it was literally like a device that could just see right through the ground as if you had dug a hole.
[01:43:51.165 --> 01:43:53.846]  And he mentioned that... Funny, I don't remember that.
[01:43:54.227 --> 01:43:58.589]  I've had guests on years ago about that, but... I wasn't years ago.
[01:43:59.849 --> 01:44:04.752]  He was on your show and then the very same night he came on George, the very same day he came on George Norris' show.
[01:44:06.178 --> 01:44:15.702]  But I was just hoping if I somehow could find, because I did an internet search and it was very difficult trying to retrace... Well it's funny, my memory must be completely failing me.
[01:44:15.742 --> 01:44:17.142]  Are you sure you didn't hear him on another show?
[01:44:17.883 --> 01:44:18.963]  No, I heard him on your show.
[01:44:19.583 --> 01:44:24.585]  He was talking about, you had him on the air, you were talking about how different it was from the military stuff.
[01:44:24.965 --> 01:44:32.468]  It was much more elegant in the way in which it achieved the goal which he was trying to achieve.
[01:44:32.568 --> 01:44:33.969]  You're talking about Dr. Nick Begich?
[01:44:34.855 --> 01:44:36.416]  No, I don't think so.
[01:44:36.656 --> 01:44:37.296]  Not hard.
[01:44:38.056 --> 01:44:39.477]  I'm sorry I can't answer your question.
[01:44:39.517 --> 01:44:39.977]  Anything else?
[01:44:39.997 --> 01:44:41.838]  Alright, point number two.
[01:44:43.218 --> 01:45:01.145]  This is the reason I firmly believe, and none of the other callers have gotten on this point, but the big reason why these guys are doing what they're doing is, number one, it's a concept found in the Bible about people eat, drink, and be merry, for tomorrow will die.
[01:45:01.670 --> 01:45:20.699]  So, I believe that the leaders of this world literally know that, like in the last scene of Raiders of the Ark, that fire is going to drop down out of the heavens and incinerate them at Armageddon, and they literally know that their deal with the devil, their 6,000 year deal with the devil, you know, like Adam and Eve struck, it's pretty much up, man.
[01:45:21.019 --> 01:45:31.384]  So they know that, hey, time's up, just like Satan and his demons in Revelation 12 chapter, they know they got a short period of time, and so they're simply trying to fulfill every desire that they ever had
[01:45:32.305 --> 01:45:37.646]  And they don't care how insane it is.
[01:45:38.726 --> 01:45:43.287]  They only got so much time so they can't keep the frogs boiling in the water for too long.
[01:45:43.667 --> 01:45:46.528]  So they know they gotta just come out the bag and go hog wild.
[01:45:46.548 --> 01:45:49.869]  Because they literally know God's about to take them out at Armageddon.
[01:45:52.469 --> 01:45:52.969]  I know this.
[01:45:53.050 --> 01:45:53.670]  I've studied them.
[01:45:53.710 --> 01:45:54.730]  They are into the occult.
[01:45:54.990 --> 01:45:55.930]  They do believe that.
[01:45:55.990 --> 01:45:56.950]  I appreciate your call.
[01:45:56.970 --> 01:45:57.470]  Good points.
[01:45:59.191 --> 01:45:59.711]  Makes sense.
[01:46:00.737 --> 01:46:02.738]  Let's go ahead and talk to Alford in Texas.
[01:46:02.838 --> 01:46:03.798]  Alford, you're on the air.
[01:46:04.338 --> 01:46:05.358]  Hey Alex, how are you doing?
[01:46:06.278 --> 01:46:07.439]  I'm usually from Chicago.
[01:46:07.499 --> 01:46:10.819]  I live in Chicago, but I'm down here in Mesa, Arizona, visiting family.
[01:46:10.839 --> 01:46:22.442]  I was down in Yuma yesterday, and I noticed, I mean, up in Chicago, I know about the contrails that come from airplanes, the low-flying jet aircraft, that they're not really contrails.
[01:46:22.502 --> 01:46:25.103]  They're actually aerosols that are in the fuel.
[01:46:25.743 --> 01:46:29.484]  And I'm down here in Mesa, and I absolutely see, the whole time I'm here,
[01:46:30.040 --> 01:46:32.803]  A clear blue sky with no contrails.
[01:46:32.843 --> 01:46:35.385]  I mean, I see the jets flying over making the contrails disappear.
[01:46:35.945 --> 01:46:38.508]  But then I was down in Yuma and I couldn't even believe it.
[01:46:38.568 --> 01:46:39.549]  It was worse than Chicago.
[01:46:39.609 --> 01:46:42.331]  It was like they were doing it all day long.
[01:46:42.852 --> 01:46:44.133]  Like they weren't even trying to cover it up.
[01:46:44.673 --> 01:46:49.698]  By the way, I have a mainstream article we posted a few days ago that has copies of the textbook.
[01:46:50.699 --> 01:46:53.761]  A middle school textbook admits chemtrails.
[01:46:53.821 --> 01:46:55.143]  Mainstream U.S.
[01:46:55.163 --> 01:46:55.483]  government
[01:46:56.463 --> 01:46:57.044]  Certified.
[01:46:57.064 --> 01:47:00.226]  That, quote, it's to keep us safe from global warming.
[01:47:00.266 --> 01:47:02.528]  It's an emergency sunscreen.
[01:47:03.529 --> 01:47:04.530]  Yeah, I know.
[01:47:04.550 --> 01:47:10.334]  And I've read a couple articles that it's actually causing some kind of hole in the ozone layer and stuff like that.
[01:47:10.354 --> 01:47:12.876]  I just wanted to get your take on it and see if you knew more about it than I did.
[01:47:13.497 --> 01:47:14.778]  I know a lot about chemtrails.
[01:47:14.978 --> 01:47:19.942]  I actually told my producer yesterday that I want to line up a bunch of chemtrail guests.
[01:47:20.342 --> 01:47:22.104]  You will hear them here on air in the next month.
[01:47:23.157 --> 01:47:26.658]  We're going to interview Carnicom, all of them, yet again.
[01:47:26.698 --> 01:47:30.879]  It's been about a year since I've really plunged into it, and a couple times a year I like to get into it.
[01:47:30.899 --> 01:47:31.520]  Thanks for the call.
[01:47:32.200 --> 01:47:32.720]  I appreciate it.
[01:47:32.740 --> 01:47:34.020]  There's a lot of things going on, sir.
[01:47:34.961 --> 01:47:38.782]  There's also nuts who think every condensation trail is a chemtrail, and that's not the case.
[01:47:39.242 --> 01:47:41.483]  But there is weather modification going on.
[01:47:41.503 --> 01:47:44.063]  There is environmental manipulation going on.
[01:47:44.083 --> 01:47:44.604]  That's admitted.
[01:47:44.624 --> 01:47:47.525]  A lot of crazy stuff going on, folks.
[01:47:48.505 --> 01:47:50.405]  Let's go ahead and talk to Mark in Wisconsin.
[01:47:50.445 --> 01:47:51.066]  Mark, welcome.
[01:47:51.666 --> 01:47:52.106]  Hi, Alex.
[01:47:53.341 --> 01:47:57.744]  Back in the early nineties, I used to watch Henry Gonzales in Texas on C-SPAN.
[01:47:57.764 --> 01:47:58.705]  Yes, the Congressman.
[01:47:58.965 --> 01:48:05.449]  Yeah, when he did special orders and he brought up about the Federal Reserve and derivatives and looming financial collapse.
[01:48:06.910 --> 01:48:10.032]  Every letter I wrote him, he always answered with sometimes three-page letters.
[01:48:10.452 --> 01:48:12.814]  You never get that response out of these guys in Wisconsin.
[01:48:13.534 --> 01:48:19.278]  And I was wondering if you'd give a quick synopsis of Henry's legacy and why we need honest congressmen.
[01:48:19.578 --> 01:48:20.519]  And also, do you think
[01:48:21.343 --> 01:48:25.104]  Financial collapse could put the brakes on his neocon Luciferian nightmare.
[01:48:26.125 --> 01:48:29.426]  Yeah, Henry's son really is nothing compared to him.
[01:48:29.966 --> 01:48:37.689]  I've got Gonzales in my film, America Destroyed by Design, talking about how the government would use terror attacks for martial law.
[01:48:38.710 --> 01:48:39.750]  He's seen the documents.
[01:48:40.210 --> 01:48:42.571]  Also, Congressman Jack Brooks, also from Texas.
[01:48:43.372 --> 01:48:45.993]  I mean, something about Texans, they're either real bad or they're real good.
[01:48:46.013 --> 01:48:49.174]  We've got a lot of bad congressmen from here, a lot of really good ones from here.
[01:48:50.050 --> 01:48:58.614]  And they talk about how the government wants to stage terror attacks and carry out a new world order and he's been dead, I don't know, five, six, seven years now.
[01:48:59.274 --> 01:49:00.254]  And he did a lot of good things.
[01:49:00.535 --> 01:49:01.535]  He was from San Antonio.
[01:49:03.976 --> 01:49:06.297]  I guarantee he wouldn't be for this La Rica on Key State either.
[01:49:06.617 --> 01:49:08.098]  He'd see right through that.
[01:49:10.339 --> 01:49:18.122]  You know when mathematicians and physicists, they do calculations and they get infinities, you know something's wrong and they've got to start the calculations over because it's flawed?
[01:49:18.735 --> 01:49:22.018]  Well, we've got this 87 trillion deficit and it's impossible to pay.
[01:49:22.038 --> 01:49:27.462]  It's straight up on the graph infinity, so something's wrong and all I can say is buy silver and gold.
[01:49:27.502 --> 01:49:28.002]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:49:28.202 --> 01:49:28.643]  You're right.
[01:49:28.663 --> 01:49:30.644]  Yeah, there's no way to ever pay it back.
[01:49:31.065 --> 01:49:34.487]  It's many times bigger than any economies combined.
[01:49:34.948 --> 01:49:39.972]  It's designed, they designed these Federal Reserve Central Bank systems as Ponzi schemes.
[01:49:40.512 --> 01:49:46.837]  It's meant to make you all destitute, then they create a new monetary system, buy everything up with that new system when they start it.
[01:49:48.692 --> 01:49:51.074]  And then they pose as our saviors after they do it to us.
[01:49:54.056 --> 01:50:02.322]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here and I'm excited to announce we're going to have a huge 9-11 conference in downtown Los Angeles on the 24th and 25th of June.
[01:50:02.502 --> 01:50:04.844]  We're expecting around a thousand people in attendance.
[01:50:05.444 --> 01:50:14.291]  At this historic event, we will irrefutably document that 9-11 was an inside job, a self-inflicted wound, a false flag terror operation.
[01:50:14.811 --> 01:50:18.314]  The conference is titled 9-11 and the Neocon Agenda.
[01:50:18.774 --> 01:50:27.101]  I'm happy to announce the conference will feature presentations by incredible speakers like BYU physics professor Stephen Jones, the father of the Star Wars program, Lt.

[01:51:07.425 --> 01:51:12.107]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[01:51:12.567 --> 01:51:19.269]  The Berkelite is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.

[01:52:40.487 --> 01:52:43.589]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[01:52:43.749 --> 01:52:49.712]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[01:52:54.315 --> 01:52:59.938]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:01.719 --> 01:53:05.081]  Johnny, Sam, Paul, I'm going to try to cram you three guys in right now.
[01:53:07.310 --> 01:53:27.801]  I just want to say it's been great working with everybody fighting a new world order and I plan to be living a long time and I love life but we all need to be thankful the lives we've had the lives we've led and I just never really thank you the listeners for it's it's it's just it's great knowing you it's great working with you and I look forward to working with you for a long time in the future but all of us need to count every day as our last
[01:53:28.539 --> 01:53:31.340]  And know that it isn't how many toys we have at the end of it that matters.
[01:53:31.680 --> 01:53:32.380]  It's what we do.
[01:53:32.440 --> 01:53:33.521]  It's the mark we set.
[01:53:33.961 --> 01:53:35.201]  It's the good things we do.
[01:53:35.301 --> 01:53:37.462]  It's leaving the world a better place than we left it.
[01:53:37.902 --> 01:53:39.163]  That's what life's really all about.
[01:53:39.883 --> 01:53:41.544]  And you'll be fulfilled if you have that attitude.
[01:53:41.564 --> 01:53:43.804]  These people that just want more, want more, want more.
[01:53:43.824 --> 01:53:45.525]  They're the most unhappy people I know.
[01:53:46.405 --> 01:53:47.786]  Johnny in Virginia.
[01:53:47.846 --> 01:53:48.586]  Johnny, go ahead.
[01:53:49.807 --> 01:53:50.547]  Alex, good evening.
[01:53:50.787 --> 01:53:51.127]  Hi.
[01:53:52.768 --> 01:53:55.489]  I just wanted to touch on the point you made.
[01:53:55.709 --> 01:53:56.329]  You're talking about
[01:53:57.415 --> 01:53:57.756]  All right.
[01:54:09.909 --> 01:54:12.950]  A little broader than fighting any particular enemy.
[01:54:12.970 --> 01:54:15.351]  No, it's fighting the American people.
[01:54:15.411 --> 01:54:16.272]  It's exterminating us.
[01:54:17.132 --> 01:54:17.632]  That's right.
[01:54:17.773 --> 01:54:20.754]  Folks, do you understand that I looked the numbers up?
[01:54:20.774 --> 01:54:24.496]  1 in about 45 people got diabetes 50, 60 years ago.
[01:54:24.596 --> 01:54:25.616]  Now it's 1 in 3.
[01:54:26.056 --> 01:54:28.277]  I mean, they're killing us, folks.
[01:54:29.078 --> 01:54:29.418]  Yes, sir.
[01:54:29.798 --> 01:54:33.960]  And you know what bothers me is that our troops are
[01:54:35.558 --> 01:54:37.399]  They're in the same shape that the Iraqi people.
[01:54:37.439 --> 01:54:39.681]  They're already dead and don't even know it.
[01:54:40.041 --> 01:54:40.262]  I know.
[01:54:40.322 --> 01:54:41.643]  And how is that supporting them?
[01:54:41.683 --> 01:54:43.284]  Marching them in to breathe that poison?
[01:54:44.045 --> 01:54:44.545]  That's right.
[01:54:44.665 --> 01:54:45.586]  And then they bring it home.
[01:54:47.107 --> 01:54:48.808]  It's in the jet stream, sir.
[01:54:50.730 --> 01:54:52.271]  The detectors have been picking it up.
[01:54:53.112 --> 01:54:53.552]  That's right.
[01:54:53.772 --> 01:54:54.993]  Eight times safe levels.
[01:54:56.234 --> 01:55:03.460]  And the people behind this, I call them VIM, they're already setting things up here in this country.
[01:55:03.480 --> 01:55:04.520]  You've already pointed that out.
[01:55:05.862 --> 01:55:09.863]  And since they didn't follow the people on the amnesty, no amnesty.
[01:55:09.883 --> 01:55:11.684]  Sir, I appreciate your call.
[01:55:11.724 --> 01:55:12.164]  Thank you.
[01:55:13.405 --> 01:55:15.945]  Let's go ahead and take another call here.
[01:55:16.906 --> 01:55:18.066]  Let's go ahead and talk to Sam.
[01:55:18.166 --> 01:55:19.667]  Sam, where are you calling us from?
[01:55:19.687 --> 01:55:21.547]  I'm calling from Minnesota.
[01:55:21.927 --> 01:55:22.167]  Hi.
[01:55:22.928 --> 01:55:23.768]  It's an honor to talk to you.
[01:55:23.808 --> 01:55:25.769]  I've been listening to you for about three or four years now.
[01:55:26.329 --> 01:55:28.289]  It's a martial art that really woke me up.
[01:55:28.309 --> 01:55:30.110]  Boost Chains 2nd Edition really woke me up.
[01:55:31.041 --> 01:55:38.587]  It actually inspired me to make my own short film that just completed in March, and it's been agreed to be screened in New York City July 19th.
[01:55:39.167 --> 01:55:45.192]  The new filmmakers, it's entitled Key Bono WTC, and we'd love anyone to go to our website.
[01:55:45.652 --> 01:55:47.593]  Anyone in the New York area to go to it would be great.
[01:55:48.054 --> 01:55:56.800]  It combined blues change and martial arts scenes, and it's just been great listening to you.
[01:55:56.820 --> 01:55:57.621]  Okay, anything else, sir?
[01:55:58.171 --> 01:55:59.954]  Let me just get my website real quick.
[01:56:00.074 --> 01:56:01.636]  ErraticProductions.com.
[01:56:01.856 --> 01:56:04.881]  E-R-R-A-T-I-K Productions.com.
[01:56:04.961 --> 01:56:05.702]  Okay, thank you.
[01:56:06.263 --> 01:56:07.244]  Let's talk to Paul.
[01:56:07.304 --> 01:56:08.987]  Paul, where are you calling us from?
[01:56:10.008 --> 01:56:10.789]  Vancouver, Canada.
[01:56:10.849 --> 01:56:11.851]  Go ahead, you've got about a minute.
[01:56:12.338 --> 01:56:17.140]  Okay, I just want to know, I heard you talking about Atlanta being the capital of the North American Union.
[01:56:17.260 --> 01:56:20.722]  I was just wondering if you could point me in the direction to do a little bit more research about that.
[01:56:20.842 --> 01:56:28.685]  I type into Google, Atlanta chosen as North American Union capital, and I've seen a bunch of mainstream news articles.
[01:56:28.705 --> 01:56:30.706]  There's a committee that set it up.
[01:56:31.106 --> 01:56:32.627]  I've been seeing that for six, seven years.
[01:56:33.307 --> 01:56:39.450]  Six, seven years ago it was a debate between Miami and Atlanta, but the committee settled I think about two years ago on it being Atlanta.
[01:56:40.250 --> 01:56:40.791]  Okay, great.
[01:56:40.811 --> 01:56:41.291]  Thank you for that.
[01:56:41.863 --> 01:56:42.463]  Thank you, sir.
[01:56:42.503 --> 01:56:44.124]  We're out of time for this hour.
[01:56:44.144 --> 01:56:45.245]  We'll come back in the next hour.
[01:56:45.565 --> 01:56:46.446]  I had him on Monday.
[01:56:46.486 --> 01:56:51.909]  It's such an important discussion with one of the chief CIA analysts, former Ronald Reagan and George Bush Sr.
[01:56:52.309 --> 01:56:54.671]  about the upcoming World War III that I'm going to re-air this.
[01:56:55.591 --> 01:56:56.512]  I don't do this very often.
[01:56:56.872 --> 01:57:01.535]  Maybe once a month I re-air an interview, but this is so important we need to do this.
[01:57:01.595 --> 01:57:03.836]  So get your tape recorders going.
[01:57:04.237 --> 01:57:05.157]  Digitally record this.
[01:57:05.177 --> 01:57:07.078]  Get this out to everybody.
[01:57:08.199 --> 01:57:09.740]  Now is the time.
[01:57:10.569 --> 01:57:13.151]  To get this out to everyone you know.
[01:57:14.732 --> 01:57:16.013]  And to call your congressman.
[01:57:16.233 --> 01:57:18.395]  Call them to talk radio.
[01:57:18.735 --> 01:57:20.357]  It's not like Iran is just going to lay there.
[01:57:20.397 --> 01:57:22.078]  If Iran is attacked, they're going to strike back.
[01:57:22.398 --> 01:57:23.499]  The government wants that.
[01:57:23.919 --> 01:57:25.360]  And then we'll all, hey we've been hit!
[01:57:25.380 --> 01:57:26.221]  We've got to fight them!
[01:57:26.521 --> 01:57:28.243]  Help them fight back against us!
[01:57:28.263 --> 01:57:29.524]  I mean, it's going to be horrible.
[01:57:29.824 --> 01:57:31.245]  They're escalating it by design.
[01:57:34.159 --> 01:57:38.400]  Order a copy of this show for your friends and family at GCNlive.com or call 877-300-7645.
[01:57:38.440 --> 01:57:38.860]  Big Brother.
[01:57:39.020 --> 01:57:39.621]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:39.641 --> 01:57:43.221]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:45.582 --> 01:57:47.203]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.721 --> 01:57:57.602]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.622 --> 01:58:01.904]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.464 --> 01:58:06.586]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:07.447 --> 01:58:11.289]  We've got senior, former CIA analyst for Reagan and Bush Sr.
[01:58:11.309 --> 01:58:13.930]  joining us coming up in the next segment.
[01:58:14.471 --> 01:58:17.532]  Articles here, data indicates Border Patrol build-ups ineffective.
[01:58:17.552 --> 01:58:18.813]  They were designed to be that way.
[01:58:21.573 --> 01:58:26.017]  We also have reports here, babies aborted for not being perfect in England.
[01:58:26.037 --> 01:58:28.380]  This is becoming more and more widespread.
[01:58:28.420 --> 01:58:31.362]  Right now, let's go to some more of your calls than Ray McGovern.
[01:58:31.863 --> 01:58:38.589]  And by the way, John, just so we have it when McGovern joins us, find the last Jon Stewart piece we aired about two weeks ago where he talks about Ray McGovern.
[01:58:38.609 --> 01:58:40.411]  I want to play that clip coming in.
[01:58:41.172 --> 01:58:44.595]  Let's go ahead and talk to Chris in Philadelphia.
[01:58:44.935 --> 01:58:45.656]  Chris, welcome.
[01:58:46.560 --> 01:58:47.241]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:58:47.321 --> 01:58:52.965]  I'm a first-time caller, long-time listener, and an owner of 75% of your information.
[01:58:54.226 --> 01:58:57.549]  I'd just like to say good job, and I'll be really brief.
[01:58:58.610 --> 01:59:00.692]  I got three points and a question.
[01:59:00.712 --> 01:59:07.897]  The first point being, I want you to elaborate off-air, is the Malthus principle of population control.
[01:59:08.718 --> 01:59:14.763]  And the second point is the Hegelian dialect and the materialistic dialect.
[01:59:15.661 --> 01:59:21.323]  And the question is, what about organization of the militias?
[01:59:21.383 --> 01:59:29.585]  I heard your comments on Friday, and the guy was saying we had to do this through peaceful means, and I just don't think that's possible.
[01:59:30.106 --> 01:59:34.987]  And I'd like to see you have some, you know, like, real reputable militia guys on your show.
[01:59:35.767 --> 01:59:38.688]  And I have another point to make about male tampering.
[01:59:40.049 --> 01:59:44.630]  David J. Smith's stuff that's been going out to his people has been getting tampered with.
[01:59:45.225 --> 01:59:47.587]  My boss had his envelope opened by the U.S.
[01:59:47.628 --> 01:59:50.170]  Postal Service, and it said, sorry, we opened your mail.
[01:59:50.691 --> 01:59:51.732]  I never got that one.
[01:59:51.752 --> 01:59:56.076]  I had to call back David J. Smith's wife, and she sent me out another one.
[01:59:56.436 --> 01:59:58.699]  That too was open, but at least I got this one.
[01:59:59.795 --> 02:00:01.817]  Well, they admit now, they search the mail.
[02:00:01.957 --> 02:00:04.099]  Again, we always heard about Russia and China.
[02:00:04.119 --> 02:00:07.221]  Now, we live under that, but the border stays wide open.
[02:00:07.782 --> 02:00:08.743]  Oh yeah, of course.
[02:00:08.763 --> 02:00:13.446]  I mean, you said short, and these are all great comments and questions.
[02:00:13.927 --> 02:00:17.590]  Let me go ahead and start trying to address the issues you brought up.
[02:00:17.650 --> 02:00:19.211]  But first off, anything else you want to add?
[02:00:19.251 --> 02:00:21.833]  I'd like to tell you too, Alex.
[02:00:21.953 --> 02:00:26.797]  In Norristown, Montgomery County, they set up an oligarchy, and this is in Pennsylvania,
[02:00:27.952 --> 02:00:31.854]  They admit they're not going to have a mayor anymore, because the mayor squandered the money.
[02:00:32.254 --> 02:00:37.157]  Now a four-person city council is going to run Norristown Borough out there.
[02:00:37.397 --> 02:00:42.840]  Oh yes, you've gone into economic crisis, so a private consortium will have to run things now?
[02:00:43.580 --> 02:00:46.121]  Well, the city council, made up of four members.
[02:00:46.962 --> 02:00:53.645]  And the other report is Homeland Security was in the vicinity of Philadelphia International Airport.
[02:00:54.352 --> 02:00:58.915]  They had our perimeter set up, and that was about a month ago, so I'd just like to report that to you.
[02:00:59.315 --> 02:01:01.136]  Thank you, I appreciate the call.
[02:01:02.177 --> 02:01:06.740]  Lord Malthus, he came up with this idea, what was it, like 200 years ago?
[02:01:06.760 --> 02:01:07.240]  170 years ago?
[02:01:07.260 --> 02:01:08.140]  I forget, I've read about him, but...
[02:01:11.360 --> 02:01:27.288]  The point is, is he said that the people are basically scum, that who cares if they die in factories or who cares if they starve to death, that the elite has a right to rule over them and there's too many people, and so just don't even take care of the population, they're basically worthless.
[02:01:27.788 --> 02:01:54.500]  And that grew in the next hundred years into Social Darwinism saying it's the elite's right to be abusive and evil and do bad things to us because it's their Social Darwinistic view that it's a selective development with evolution and that they're actually helping the earth by being ruthless and because they are ruthless that gives them a right to rule and it just goes on and on so that's the Malthusian theory
[02:01:56.661 --> 02:01:58.042]  As it is known.
[02:01:58.902 --> 02:02:00.263]  And you had a bunch of other questions.
[02:02:00.283 --> 02:02:02.884]  There were so many I couldn't keep track of all of them.
[02:02:02.924 --> 02:02:06.966]  But we're going to go to break now and come back with Ray McGovern.
[02:02:07.326 --> 02:02:13.449]  I mean the whole Malthusian Theory fits nicely into Dr. Pianca here at UT Austin, saying 90% of us need to die.
[02:02:13.489 --> 02:02:14.830]  The dying needs to start now.
[02:02:15.230 --> 02:02:16.711]  He's ready for his family to die.
[02:02:17.051 --> 02:02:18.812]  It's sad, but he's ready to go first.
[02:02:19.412 --> 02:02:20.753]  And then his own students write,
[02:02:21.656 --> 02:02:29.182]  Dissertations that are online saying, no, we all must die, and that we're just a scourge and a parasite ourselves.
[02:02:29.222 --> 02:02:33.204]  But of course the elite, they'll have to organize the dying and run things.
[02:02:33.284 --> 02:02:38.428]  And they represent the animals, so they'll go ahead and take all our rights away in the name of the animals.
[02:02:38.888 --> 02:02:41.951]  It's not that they want power, they're just trying to save the earth.
[02:02:42.291 --> 02:02:43.992]  It's a rationale for total control.
[02:02:45.925 --> 02:02:54.174]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here and I'm excited to announce we're going to have a huge 9-11 conference in downtown Los Angeles on the 24th and 25th of June.
[02:02:54.375 --> 02:02:56.717]  We're expecting around 1,000 people in attendance.
[02:02:57.318 --> 02:03:06.168]  At this historic event, we will irrefutably document that 9-11 was an inside job, a self-inflicted wound, a false flag terror operation.
[02:03:06.688 --> 02:03:10.209]  The conference is titled 9-11 and the Neo-Con Agenda.
[02:03:10.649 --> 02:03:31.417]  I'm happy to announce the conference will feature presentations by incredible speakers like BYU physics professor Stephen Jones, the father of the Star Wars program, Lieutenant Colonel Robert Bowman, former top-level CIA analyst for Reagan and Bush, Ray McGovern, 9-11 hero William Ron Rivas, author Webster Charnley, Professor Jim Fetzer, and many, many others, including special guests.
[02:03:31.757 --> 02:03:35.398]  I'll also be debuting my explosive new film, Terror Storm, at the conference.
[02:03:35.958 --> 02:03:37.199]  Arm yourself with the truth.
[02:03:37.579 --> 02:03:42.842]  Secure your tickets today at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[02:03:46.056 --> 02:03:49.319]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[02:03:49.379 --> 02:03:53.562]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[02:03:53.823 --> 02:03:56.605]  But, if you place them on the magnet, all would stick.
[02:03:56.805 --> 02:03:59.187]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[02:03:59.387 --> 02:04:08.034]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[02:04:08.234 --> 02:04:09.575]  The Berkey light is different.
[02:04:09.776 --> 02:04:13.899]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[02:04:13.899 --> 02:04:14.680]  We're good to go!
[02:04:33.257 --> 02:04:33.979]  We're good to go.
[02:04:46.141 --> 02:04:49.724]  Are you looking for a one-stop shop to find all your favorite books and videos?
[02:04:49.984 --> 02:04:50.844]  Look no further!
[02:04:51.145 --> 02:04:53.726]  Northern Voice Bookstore has everything you need.
[02:04:54.147 --> 02:05:02.653]  Hundreds of titles, from self-defense, survival, and financial freedom, to history, politics, conspiracy, and everything you need to know about the New World Order.
[02:05:02.813 --> 02:05:03.293]  You can order
[02:05:03.393 --> 02:05:03.773]  I think so.
[02:05:20.427 --> 02:05:21.268]  We're good to go.
[02:05:50.587 --> 02:05:51.208]  Big Brother.
[02:05:51.888 --> 02:05:52.929]  Mainstream media.
[02:05:53.649 --> 02:05:54.770]  Government cover-ups.
[02:05:55.410 --> 02:05:56.231]  You want answers?
[02:05:56.991 --> 02:05:58.912]  Well, so does he.
[02:05:58.932 --> 02:06:02.475]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:02.735 --> 02:06:06.857]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:06:08.739 --> 02:06:11.941]  The criminal neocons know that their time is short.
[02:06:13.602 --> 02:06:14.682]  It's a Ponzi scheme.
[02:06:14.702 --> 02:06:16.824]  They've just got to keep pumping up the bubble.
[02:06:17.712 --> 02:06:20.293]  Or it'll pop, it'll burst and implode in on them.
[02:06:20.953 --> 02:06:34.737]  So to cover up all the past corruption and bit rigging and all the war profiteering and the domestic corruption, they just hurdle forward headlong saying, no, no, no, we're dictators, we're above the law.
[02:06:35.297 --> 02:06:36.757]  And so we're turning up the heat.
[02:06:37.018 --> 02:06:44.460]  I'm here on Memorial Day, Ray McGovern, Senior CIA Analyst, Advisor to Ronald Reagan, George Bush Senior, and others in the agency, 27 years.
[02:06:45.900 --> 02:06:50.523]  Tirelessly traveling the country, exposing the great peril our Republic is in.
[02:06:50.843 --> 02:06:55.146]  He, of course, is an Army veteran himself, a Vietnam heir, and we are honored to have him.
[02:06:55.166 --> 02:06:57.527]  But before we go to him, I want to play this Jon Stewart piece.
[02:06:57.807 --> 02:06:58.888]  It's about three and a half minutes long.
[02:06:58.928 --> 02:07:01.650]  We've played this before, but I want to play it one more time.
[02:07:02.210 --> 02:07:05.292]  This is just a few days after he confronted
[02:07:07.130 --> 02:07:09.151]  Rumsfeld on his lies.
[02:07:09.211 --> 02:07:12.453]  And by the way, I've got a new film coming out that isn't really about 9-11.
[02:07:12.473 --> 02:07:13.994]  We spent about 15 minutes on 9-11.
[02:07:14.294 --> 02:07:16.976]  Most of the film is about Iraq and the lies.
[02:07:17.936 --> 02:07:27.681]  And, I mean, I had so many clips of Rumsfeld saying that they found WMDs, or knew where they were, or we know he has weapons of mass destruction, that I couldn't even put them all in the film.
[02:07:28.462 --> 02:07:29.903]  Took a long time to go dig all these up.
[02:07:29.943 --> 02:07:30.303]  We did.
[02:07:30.803 --> 02:07:34.365]  And then he has the nerve to lie again and say to McGovern, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[02:07:34.465 --> 02:07:36.066]  Those, uh, I never said that.
[02:07:36.684 --> 02:07:41.525]  So let's play this little clip, and notice how the media responded and attacked McGovern.
[02:07:42.345 --> 02:07:48.526]  Attacked McGovern for simply saying the Emperor has no clothes.
[02:07:48.806 --> 02:07:53.167]  So let's roll this clip, and we'll be joined by great American patriot, Ray McGovern.
[02:07:53.207 --> 02:07:53.447]  Here it is.
[02:08:02.159 --> 02:08:03.040]  How is that covered?
[02:08:03.140 --> 02:08:09.864]  For example, last week in Atlanta, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld was giving a speech when he was suddenly interrupted.
[02:08:10.364 --> 02:08:16.088]  There was Screaming Lady, and of course Screaming Fellow also joined in, and then Screaming Lady with War Crimes Man.
[02:08:17.269 --> 02:08:23.773]  Typical easily dismissed crackpots doing the same old... Wait, I'm sorry sir, you had a question?
[02:08:24.472 --> 02:08:28.755]  I'm Ray McGovern, a 27-year veteran of the Central Intelligence Agency.
[02:08:29.216 --> 02:08:35.921]  Why did you lie to get us into a war that was not necessary and that has caused these kinds of casualties?
[02:08:36.502 --> 02:08:37.142]  Rough row.
[02:08:37.162 --> 02:08:39.904]  First of all, I haven't lied.
[02:08:40.925 --> 02:08:41.045]  Oh!
[02:08:41.505 --> 02:08:42.206]  He didn't lie!
[02:08:42.226 --> 02:08:44.308]  Alright, well that settles it, everybody.
[02:08:44.348 --> 02:08:45.288]  There's pound cake in the back.
[02:08:45.328 --> 02:08:47.010]  We can all have a nice time.
[02:08:47.170 --> 02:08:51.934]  It appears that there were not weapons of mass destruction there.
[02:08:52.374 --> 02:08:53.475]  You said you knew where they were.
[02:08:54.531 --> 02:08:55.051]  I did not.
[02:08:56.032 --> 02:08:56.252]  See?
[02:08:56.272 --> 02:09:00.796]  He never said he knew where they were.
[02:09:00.816 --> 02:09:02.397]  We know where they are.
[02:09:02.477 --> 02:09:17.408]  They're in the area around Tikrit and Baghdad and East, West, South and North somewhere.
[02:09:18.049 --> 02:09:21.051]  Well, to be fair, Rumsfeld probably never saw that episode of Meet the Press.
[02:09:24.722 --> 02:09:30.457]  So the Secretary of Defense caught in a contradiction about weapons of mass destruction.
[02:09:31.660 --> 02:09:33.424]  Surely that will be a big story.
[02:09:34.924 --> 02:09:37.786]  How much of an axe do you have to grind with Secretary Rumsfeld?
[02:09:37.907 --> 02:09:39.448]  But he wasn't just any heckler.
[02:09:39.488 --> 02:09:40.188]  Were you nervous?
[02:09:40.208 --> 02:09:42.450]  Tucker, I resent the word heckler.
[02:09:42.671 --> 02:09:43.892]  I'd like you to take that back.
[02:09:44.052 --> 02:09:45.233]  Okay, I'm not taking it back!
[02:09:45.433 --> 02:09:50.677]  Um, Rumsfeld encouraged whoever, I think, had their hands on you at the time to let you stay there.
[02:09:50.737 --> 02:09:52.158]  Does he get any credit for that today?
[02:09:52.178 --> 02:09:54.200]  Isn't it enough that he was wrong and had bad judgment?
[02:09:54.280 --> 02:09:55.321]  Why does he have to be a liar too?
[02:09:55.881 --> 02:09:58.384]  Well, you know, that's the question you have to direct to him.
[02:09:59.264 --> 02:09:59.925]  But won't.
[02:10:02.071 --> 02:10:06.235]  To be fair, one news network was able to question Rumsfeld personally.
[02:10:07.036 --> 02:10:07.776]  No holds barred.
[02:10:08.377 --> 02:10:13.481]  So when you hear people say, we won the war, but we lost the peace... Oh, that's nonsense.
[02:10:13.582 --> 02:10:17.045]  So it's your way or the highway is not, uh, true?
[02:10:17.485 --> 02:10:19.807]  It is so wrong, it's just unbelievable.
[02:10:20.988 --> 02:10:23.731]  Mmm, that's some good old-fashioned muck polishing.
[02:10:24.995 --> 02:10:32.067]  Yes, as Iraq continues to spiral out of control and criticism of Rumsfeld grows, Fox News decided it was time to take an in-depth look at the issue.
[02:10:37.535 --> 02:10:44.561]  Yes, why he fights an hour-long investigative report into the real Donald Rumsfeld hosted by Necklace Johnson.
[02:10:45.101 --> 02:10:49.585]  He wears a pedometer on his belt to count every step he takes every day.
[02:10:49.805 --> 02:10:53.568]  But even for a former college wrestler who still did one-arm push-ups.
[02:10:53.768 --> 02:10:57.772]  People Magazine that named him one of the year's sexiest men.
[02:11:01.986 --> 02:11:03.748]  Wow, one of the year's sexiest men.
[02:11:03.928 --> 02:11:07.351]  I believe though that was a pretty off year for sexy men.
[02:11:08.992 --> 02:11:11.414]  If I remember correctly, that was the year Tom Bosley won.
[02:11:11.434 --> 02:11:14.657]  So, it didn't...
[02:11:16.562 --> 02:11:24.268]  Now, the special did include interviews with Rumsfeld critic General Paul Van Riper, one of the officers who had called for Rumsfeld's resignation.
[02:11:24.568 --> 02:11:27.010]  I'm sure there'll be no change in the reporter's inflection.
[02:11:27.731 --> 02:11:29.632]  What are you trying to accomplish by doing this?
[02:11:29.973 --> 02:11:35.657]  And you don't think this debate threatens the civilian leadership of the military?
[02:11:35.957 --> 02:11:38.399]  Does that hurt the war effort?
[02:11:41.281 --> 02:11:44.564]  I can't tell if I'm smelling the fairness or the balance.
[02:11:46.075 --> 02:11:50.198]  But ultimately, why he fights could only end with why.
[02:11:50.218 --> 02:11:57.563]  That is a piece of the airplane that crashed into this building.
[02:11:57.843 --> 02:12:03.387]  It's a wonderful reminder to people who come in here of what happened.
[02:12:04.307 --> 02:12:04.728]  Wonderful?
[02:12:05.708 --> 02:12:09.130]  Couldn't have gone with stark or vivid or effective?
[02:12:09.671 --> 02:12:13.433]  It's almost like you're enjoying this.
[02:12:13.573 --> 02:12:14.254]  We'll be right back.
[02:12:14.807 --> 02:12:15.968]  You said you knew where they were.
[02:12:15.988 --> 02:12:19.811]  Near Tikrit, near Baghdad, and North, East, South, and West of there.
[02:12:19.891 --> 02:12:20.871]  Those are your words.
[02:12:20.991 --> 02:12:26.555]  They're in the area around Tikrit and Baghdad and East, West, South, and North somewhat.
[02:12:27.556 --> 02:12:30.918]  Alright, Ray McGovern, thanks for sitting through that on this Memorial Day.
[02:12:30.938 --> 02:12:32.439]  Thank you for joining us, sir.
[02:12:34.850 --> 02:12:36.411]  First time I heard the whole thing.
[02:12:36.471 --> 02:12:39.033]  Actually, it was down in Atlanta.
[02:12:39.053 --> 02:12:40.374]  It was completely serendipitous.
[02:12:40.394 --> 02:12:45.978]  I was down there for a totally different reason, and when I heard he was coming down to give a lecture,
[02:12:56.969 --> 02:13:11.080]  I had to use, actually, some of my old tradecraft to wangle a ticket, but I invested $40, and that still stings, by the way, and got into his lecture and sat near the microphone that would be used for questions and answers.
[02:13:11.701 --> 02:13:26.333]  So it was fortuitous, and I guess what really turned me on or off, depending how you look at it, Alex, is when one of those ladies who was protesting said, you know, you've told a lot of lies, you've told a lot of lies,
[02:13:27.538 --> 02:13:53.449]  And Rumsfeld, you've probably seen him do this, he sort of wrung his hands and said, gosh, you know, when people accuse the President of the United States of telling lies, I just, you know, she didn't accuse the President of the United States, she accused Rumsfeld, but he went on and he said, that is just so corrosive, so destructive of the trust that is necessary for
[02:13:53.956 --> 02:13:55.317]  ...for government to work.
[02:13:55.857 --> 02:13:57.938]  It's just so, so wrong.
[02:13:58.579 --> 02:14:10.126]  And then he went on to the next question and I said to myself, oh my goodness, you know, I have to ask some question of him just to throw his words back on him and show that he's a consummate liar.
[02:14:11.363 --> 02:14:15.786]  As luck would have it, I got second in line and was able to do that on live TV.
[02:14:16.846 --> 02:14:37.778]  Now let's be clear, and you're right, Atlanta, you're there, there are people who are standing up saying things, but you're in the line to ask questions, that's why you're mic'd, that's why we can hear you, but then some of the media tried to imply that you were a heckler, when in reality you were there asking questions, and then security came over and was basically telling you to knock it off.
[02:14:37.798 --> 02:14:40.440]  Can you go over what actually happened there?
[02:14:40.940 --> 02:14:41.841]  Sure, yeah.
[02:14:43.743 --> 02:14:45.064]  I was not heckling, of course.
[02:14:45.504 --> 02:14:50.729]  I was in line, and he came to me, called on me, and you heard how I started.
[02:14:52.871 --> 02:15:02.599]  After I got into it, and he seemed to be getting a little bit uncharacteristically unnerved, this big guy comes down with a white coat.
[02:15:02.819 --> 02:15:03.760]  A white coat, actually.
[02:15:05.197 --> 02:15:06.678]  And a black baseball cap.
[02:15:06.978 --> 02:15:19.903]  And since he knew the cameras were coming well from the back, he placed himself around it in front of me, put his elbow in my solar plexus, and started driving me out of the arena.
[02:15:19.923 --> 02:15:23.484]  And that's when I cried out, this is America.
[02:15:24.044 --> 02:15:29.026]  And when Rumsfeld saw that, he had an instant decision to make.
[02:15:30.767 --> 02:15:33.007]  And he made the right one from his point of view.
[02:15:33.027 --> 02:15:34.168]  I mean, it just would have been
[02:15:35.057 --> 02:15:46.120]  Pretty bad PR to have someone who was simply asking him a question, which he already lied about, to be sort of carried out of this conference.
[02:15:46.160 --> 02:15:56.062]  Well, Bush had me kidnapped at a press conference for asking a question he didn't like, and he directed them, they grabbed me, they put me in the police car, drove me around for an hour, threw me out on the side of the highway.
[02:15:56.122 --> 02:16:02.484]  So, this has been going on for a while, but what does it say about the mentality that you're in line to ask a question
[02:16:03.224 --> 02:16:09.449]  And Rumsfeld hasn't even told them to grab you, but still, they're physically manhandling you.
[02:16:09.669 --> 02:16:19.576]  Well, somebody pointed out, some very acute observer, that Rumsfeld did sort of give a little wink to the back of the room when he got into a little bit of trouble with me.
[02:16:19.596 --> 02:16:20.696]  Yeah, that's what Bush did with me.
[02:16:20.736 --> 02:16:22.678]  Yeah, they look at him and then look at you.
[02:16:22.698 --> 02:16:28.822]  Yeah, and then the guy came down, and then when Rumsfeld saw the choice here had me carried out,
[02:16:29.717 --> 02:16:33.423]  Uh, or try to, you know, try to persist a little bit and put me down.
[02:16:33.443 --> 02:16:41.995]  Uh, he, he of course is the champion Princeton debater and, uh, he exuded this confidence and said, Oh no, no, no, let him stay for a second.
[02:16:42.756 --> 02:16:45.600]  And thankfully that second expanded into two more minutes.
[02:16:47.378 --> 02:16:48.659]  Well, they've got a problem.
[02:16:48.839 --> 02:16:56.604]  No one that I know, and the polls show this, is buying their baloney anymore, Ray McGovern, and so the credibility gap is there.
[02:16:57.004 --> 02:17:01.507]  Bush is plunging down to 28 percentage points, which is a record.
[02:17:01.527 --> 02:17:02.748]  Where do you see this going?
[02:17:03.888 --> 02:17:13.054]  Well, just focusing on Rumsfeld, you know, none other than pundit Jim Hoagland, no liberal heat,
[02:17:13.894 --> 02:17:18.666]  Has pointed out that when Rumsfeld runs into difficulty, he expands the problem.
[02:17:19.987 --> 02:17:21.828]  Uh, and that's what I worry about.
[02:17:21.868 --> 02:17:25.310]  I worry about Iran, which seems to be next on their agenda.
[02:17:25.830 --> 02:17:28.371]  Doesn't make any sense, but neither did Iraq.
[02:17:28.871 --> 02:17:42.477]  Yeah, let's talk about, let's talk about Olbert coming here, uh, we've got Blair coming to the U.S., they're having the war councils, and we talk about that Ponzi scheme always inflating it, you know, the next crisis to cover the last.
[02:17:42.817 --> 02:17:44.098]  We'll be right back with Ray McGovern.

[02:18:46.451 --> 02:18:50.373]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt.
[02:18:50.573 --> 02:19:02.859]  But the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999, reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking 10.57% annual increase, outpacing its previous 10 years.
[02:19:03.279 --> 02:19:03.679]  The U.S.
[02:19:03.739 --> 02:19:09.322]  economy receives its currency by taking on debt through a private banking institution called the Federal Reserve System.
[02:19:09.702 --> 02:19:11.923]  In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%.
[02:19:13.784 --> 02:19:14.845]  It's bad enough that the U.S.
[02:19:14.885 --> 02:19:17.726]  citizens is bound by debt in order to have commerce.
[02:19:17.846 --> 02:19:23.869]  However, shocking the economy with a reduction of this magnitude could wipe out years of growth in a stock portfolio.
[02:19:24.289 --> 02:19:27.631]  Before you make your next investment decision, get the cold hard facts.
[02:19:27.711 --> 02:19:34.054]  Call 1-800-686-2237 for your free report on the outstanding level of public and private debt.

[02:21:50.111 --> 02:21:50.712]  Welcome back.
[02:21:52.392 --> 02:21:55.574]  We can't back down from the neocon agenda.
[02:21:56.074 --> 02:22:00.697]  This is a real attempt to take our country over, use it as an engine of world domination.
[02:22:00.737 --> 02:22:06.080]  They admit that themselves, Ray McGovern Sr., retired CIA analyst, worked for Reagan and Bush and many others.
[02:22:06.904 --> 02:22:13.268]  Mr. McGovern, this is a short segment, long segment, coming up plenty of time to get into details, but no one wants to attack Iran.
[02:22:13.528 --> 02:22:16.990]  That is the people, but they seem to have now gotten more of the Europeans on board.
[02:22:17.050 --> 02:22:20.412]  The Chinese and Russians aren't right now, but I wouldn't count on that.
[02:22:20.532 --> 02:22:23.234]  Israel's Obert was here, as you know, last week.
[02:22:23.554 --> 02:22:27.396]  They're talking about attacking, even if we don't, but trying to draw us in.
[02:22:27.916 --> 02:22:31.899]  Blair's running around announcing a new doctrine of preemptive
[02:22:32.979 --> 02:22:34.579]  Progressivism is what he calls it.
[02:22:35.079 --> 02:22:37.460]  I mean, I think these nuts are really going to try to do it.
[02:22:37.480 --> 02:22:41.961]  Can you give us, in a nutshell, the analysis of what's driving this?
[02:22:43.581 --> 02:22:45.381]  I think I can, Alex.
[02:22:45.421 --> 02:22:47.102]  I've been thinking a lot about this here.
[02:22:48.722 --> 02:22:53.703]  First off, people who say this is a crazy thing to do are absolutely right.
[02:22:54.523 --> 02:23:00.844]  They must realize, though, that the crazy filter is not applied to decisions like this by the White House.
[02:23:02.499 --> 02:23:04.300]  What's happening here is that the U.S.
[02:23:04.380 --> 02:23:06.181]  and Israel are using each other.
[02:23:09.323 --> 02:23:20.730]  Bush and company, in their vision, which is well explained in the Project for the New American Century documents, are determined to dominate that part of the world.
[02:23:22.666 --> 02:23:30.413]  It's kind of hard just to say, hey, we're the sole remaining superpower of the world and so we're just going to do what we have to to dominate the part of the world.
[02:23:30.953 --> 02:23:39.160]  What they think they need to do more cleverly is to say, our ally, Israel, of course Israel is not our ally.
[02:23:39.180 --> 02:23:40.881]  I hope your listeners know that.
[02:23:40.921 --> 02:23:43.083]  There is no defense treaty with Israel.
[02:23:43.593 --> 02:23:49.015]  Our ally Israel is in danger from nuclear weapons being delivered by Iran.
[02:23:49.456 --> 02:23:54.618]  It doesn't matter that they're 700 years off of a nuclear weapon, but this is the argument.
[02:23:55.018 --> 02:24:03.562]  And so it's much easier for the Bush regime to say, look, this is a matter of a mutual security obligation.
[02:24:04.142 --> 02:24:05.583]  Of which there exists none.
[02:24:06.244 --> 02:24:09.846]  And we need to spring to Israel's defense.
[02:24:10.567 --> 02:24:16.832]  Of course, Congress is beholden to all that money they get from the Israel lobby, and specifically AIPAC.
[02:24:16.932 --> 02:24:27.500]  And so, just as they did with Iraq in writing letters to the President, we need regime change in Iraq, they're doing the same thing now for regime change in Iran.
[02:24:28.635 --> 02:24:32.496]  Now, as far as the Israelis are concerned, this is great for them.
[02:24:33.076 --> 02:24:37.438]  None of the usual obligations of a mutual defense treaty.
[02:24:38.038 --> 02:24:41.199]  They don't even have to tell us when they take off after another country.
[02:24:41.779 --> 02:24:48.841]  And more than that, they get a mutual defense treaty in reality because the President, as he has three times in the last couple of months,
[02:24:49.381 --> 02:24:54.785]  Keeps referring to Israel as our ally, to whom we are obligated to spring to their defense.
[02:24:54.825 --> 02:24:58.468]  Well, Ray McGovern, isn't it really a mutual attack treaty?
[02:24:58.548 --> 02:25:06.514]  Because Israel's saying they're going to probably go ahead and attack Iran, and then I see people in the Knesset every week criticizing the U.S.
[02:25:06.814 --> 02:25:08.576]  for not already attacking them.
[02:25:08.616 --> 02:25:09.837]  I mean, this is ridiculous.
[02:25:10.177 --> 02:25:14.220]  Yeah, the question is whether they have the capability of doing the job themselves.
[02:25:14.640 --> 02:25:16.802]  Most of the folks I talk to
[02:25:17.302 --> 02:25:21.465]  What about Seymour Hersh's reports and other foreign reports?
[02:25:21.486 --> 02:25:30.313]  I found Hersh to be very credible in the past that special forces have been there sneaking around for a year surveilling targets.
[02:25:47.581 --> 02:25:50.903]  Alex, not only Special Forces, U.S.
[02:25:50.983 --> 02:25:51.523]  Marines.
[02:25:52.303 --> 02:25:53.204]  Okay?
[02:25:53.324 --> 02:25:53.444]  U.S.
[02:25:53.524 --> 02:26:01.108]  Marines and Special Forces ordered there by the same Donald Rumsfeld without any congressional authorization
[02:26:01.653 --> 02:26:04.075]  Without any specific decision memorandum.
[02:26:04.135 --> 02:26:06.077]  But think about what a provocation that is.
[02:26:06.197 --> 02:26:08.919]  Iran knows that we've got troops in their country.
[02:26:08.979 --> 02:26:10.781]  Imagine if they were doing this to us.
[02:26:11.181 --> 02:26:12.202]  Yeah, of course they know.
[02:26:12.222 --> 02:26:16.666]  As a matter of fact, they've captured some of the minority folks that are cooperating with these troops.
[02:26:17.286 --> 02:26:17.907]  So they're ready.
[02:26:18.307 --> 02:26:19.368]  They're ready for action.
[02:26:19.929 --> 02:26:22.531]  They're hoping against hope that we won't do it.
[02:26:23.274 --> 02:26:29.780]  I predict that we will do it, and that we'll do it sooner rather than later, as early as late June or early July.
[02:26:29.800 --> 02:26:30.861]  Oh my gosh!
[02:26:30.921 --> 02:26:41.230]  We will have three aircraft carrier task forces in the Persian Gulf in another week, and all the propaganda business has been orchestrated.
[02:26:41.310 --> 02:26:44.773]  It's very much like a few weeks before we attacked Iraq.
[02:26:46.154 --> 02:26:55.276]  And then we add this fake story, totally manufactured about making Jews, Christians, and Zoroastrians wear pieces of cloth, including yellow for Jews.
[02:26:55.696 --> 02:26:58.757]  Turns out it was completely and totally made up.
[02:26:59.217 --> 02:27:05.439]  Even the Jewish member of the Mullahs or of their ruling council there said it's total propaganda.
[02:27:05.519 --> 02:27:08.619]  It's like the babies and the incubators.
[02:27:09.059 --> 02:27:10.580]  Yeah, they're in Kuwait.
[02:27:10.880 --> 02:27:11.240]  Stay there.
[02:27:12.080 --> 02:27:12.521]  Stay there, sir.
[02:27:12.541 --> 02:27:13.661]  I want to get your analysis on that.
[02:27:13.982 --> 02:27:15.123]  How the attack will come down.
[02:27:15.263 --> 02:27:17.084]  What Iran is going to do.
[02:27:17.184 --> 02:27:22.769]  Because they're considering it an act of premeditated aggression if Iran fights back.
[02:27:22.929 --> 02:27:26.612]  They're actually saying it will be a terrorist attack if Iran fights back.
[02:27:27.532 --> 02:27:30.175]  And they're talking about nuking them if they fight back.
[02:27:31.015 --> 02:27:31.936]  This is unbelievable.
[02:27:32.056 --> 02:27:34.158]  We're about to have World War III, boys and girls.
[02:27:34.178 --> 02:27:34.858]  Ray McGovern?
[02:27:36.339 --> 02:27:37.260]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.741 --> 02:27:39.242]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:40.243 --> 02:27:43.044]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.145 --> 02:27:50.207]  People who use Cardivite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[02:27:50.407 --> 02:27:53.808]  For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself time-tested.
[02:27:53.988 --> 02:27:57.429]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite.
[02:27:57.719 --> 02:28:00.981]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[02:28:01.001 --> 02:28:06.464]  This basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the diseases that we see.
[02:28:06.504 --> 02:28:16.130]  When we do our program, you know, in herbal formulas like cardivite and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill, now going for regular jobs a few months later, we know we're doing something right.
[02:28:16.250 --> 02:28:17.591]  It's a well thought out formula.
[02:28:17.631 --> 02:28:23.034]  I mean, the idea of it working on yeast and metals both at the same time and liver function is dead on.
[02:28:23.539 --> 02:28:27.960]  You'll find I think that it'll work more than just on heart problems and circulation problems.
[02:28:27.980 --> 02:28:29.421]  It'll work on other problems as well.
[02:28:29.581 --> 02:28:34.082]  For more information call 1-877-928-8822 or visit our website at www.heartdrop.com.

[02:29:04.995 --> 02:29:08.438]  So effective you can drink raw, untreated water from lakes, rivers and streams.
[02:29:08.758 --> 02:29:18.107]  Unlike other sport bottles, the Sport Berkey's patented filter formulation is so powerful it removes cysts, parasites, harmful bacteria, and chemicals like herbicides and pesticides.
[02:29:18.367 --> 02:29:21.870]  It even reduces radon-222, lead, and other heavy metals.

[02:29:47.752 --> 02:29:52.936]  Two weeks ago you were riding a bicycle, and today you're showing up in your new car and telling me you're buying a house?
[02:29:53.277 --> 02:29:54.758]  What did you do, rob Bill Gates?
[02:29:54.858 --> 02:29:56.840]  No, John, I didn't rob Bill Gates.
[02:29:57.120 --> 02:30:02.645]  What I did do is visit the website www.DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[02:30:02.926 --> 02:30:09.192]  That's where I learn how to make $3,000 to $9,000 each and every week, starting with my very first week.
[02:30:09.512 --> 02:30:11.694]  It's a simple program that does all the work for you.
[02:30:11.974 --> 02:30:15.419]  I'm already up to $25,000 just going on my third week!
[02:30:15.659 --> 02:30:16.140]  Whoa!
[02:30:16.460 --> 02:30:17.661]  What was that website again?
[02:30:17.762 --> 02:30:21.226]  It's www.DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[02:30:21.526 --> 02:30:22.648]  Now write this down, John.
[02:30:22.788 --> 02:30:27.094]  You should go there and learn how this program can help you become financially independent, too.
[02:30:27.254 --> 02:30:27.835]  Thanks, Bill.
[02:30:28.095 --> 02:30:29.296]  I'm going there right now.
[02:30:29.717 --> 02:30:30.358]  Check, please!
[02:30:32.121 --> 02:30:33.581]  Uh, you got this one, right, Bill?
[02:30:34.061 --> 02:30:34.642]  Sure, John.
[02:30:34.882 --> 02:30:39.243]  Don't forget, it's www.DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[02:30:39.543 --> 02:30:41.243]  Next time, you'll be buying me lunch.
[02:30:41.403 --> 02:30:41.743]  Deal.
[02:30:47.164 --> 02:30:52.285]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:30:52.985 --> 02:30:55.246]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:30:56.852 --> 02:31:00.579]  We could not be talking about a more important issue today.
[02:31:00.740 --> 02:31:01.902]  That's why we're here live.
[02:31:02.182 --> 02:31:05.469]  Again, I'm so honored that Ray McGovern is taking time off on a day off.
[02:31:06.101 --> 02:31:11.263]  He teaches as a professor and all his other activism to join us.
[02:31:11.524 --> 02:31:12.744]  We're looking at World War III.
[02:31:12.784 --> 02:31:19.067]  He's going to be at our big 9-11 conference in Los Angeles on the 24th and 25th of June.
[02:31:19.427 --> 02:31:20.588]  Here's the details.
[02:31:21.048 --> 02:31:29.352]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here and I'm excited to announce we're going to have a huge 9-11 conference in downtown Los Angeles on the 24th and 25th of June.
[02:31:29.532 --> 02:31:31.853]  We're expecting around a thousand people in attendance.
[02:31:32.473 --> 02:31:41.401]  At this historic event, we will irrefutably document that 9-11 was an inside job, a self-inflicted wound, a false flag-tear operation.
[02:31:41.882 --> 02:31:45.505]  The conference is titled 9-11 and the Neocon Agenda.
[02:31:45.865 --> 02:31:55.514]  I'm happy to announce the conference will feature presentations by incredible speakers like BYU physics professor Stephen Jones, the father of the Star Wars program, Lieutenant Colonel Robert Bowman,
[02:31:55.914 --> 02:32:06.738]  Former top-level CIA analyst for Reagan and Bush, Ray McGovern, 9-11 hero William Ron Regas, author Webster Turnbull, Professor Jim Fetzer, and many, many others, including special guests.
[02:32:07.058 --> 02:32:10.839]  I'll also be debuting my explosive new film, Terror Storm, at the conference.
[02:32:11.299 --> 02:32:12.519]  Arm yourself with the truth.
[02:32:12.899 --> 02:32:18.201]  Secure your tickets today at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[02:32:22.219 --> 02:32:24.560]  I hope you will take action, folks.
[02:32:24.680 --> 02:32:27.640]  I hope that you will go to InfoWars.com and get your tickets.
[02:32:27.680 --> 02:32:37.203]  I hope that you will call toll-free to get them 1-888-253-3139 or go to that same website or call that same toll-free number and get my film, Martial Law, get Road to Tyranny.
[02:32:37.523 --> 02:32:40.244]  Get them, make copies, get them out to everybody you can now.
[02:32:40.304 --> 02:32:42.024]  Going back to Ray McGovern.
[02:32:42.757 --> 02:32:48.340]  Mr. McGovern, go through this for us, because we know that they're saying they want to hit them.
[02:32:48.360 --> 02:32:49.901]  We know they're saying they need to hit them.
[02:32:49.941 --> 02:32:57.385]  We know that Cheney's saying they can have nukes within a month, when the CIA's own assessment last year is ten years.
[02:32:57.845 --> 02:32:59.866]  We have you talking about that in the new film, Terror Storm.
[02:33:00.306 --> 02:33:01.887]  But earlier you said seven years.
[02:33:01.947 --> 02:33:03.508]  I guess there's some new assessment.
[02:33:05.489 --> 02:33:07.090]  And then we have all this propaganda.
[02:33:07.470 --> 02:33:10.612]  We were talking about that before the break, claiming they were going to put
[02:33:11.807 --> 02:33:13.929]  Special symbols on Jews and Christians.
[02:33:14.249 --> 02:33:15.610]  Again, total fabrication.
[02:33:16.631 --> 02:33:21.515]  And then my other question is, have we seen three carrier groups mass in the last year?
[02:33:21.535 --> 02:33:24.017]  I mean, is this the first time we've seen this configuration?
[02:33:24.297 --> 02:33:26.239]  What are you hearing from people inside the government?
[02:33:26.639 --> 02:33:32.764]  Break it down for us, and then what we'll see if this attack takes place, what some of the different scenarios are, sir.
[02:33:34.245 --> 02:33:38.509]  Well, there is one carrier task force already there in the Gulf.
[02:33:38.809 --> 02:33:40.110]  Two are steaming toward it.
[02:33:40.874 --> 02:33:46.620]  And that last report, that I have at least, they will all be there in another week or so.
[02:33:46.640 --> 02:33:57.391]  The folly of this attack can be explained partly by the same folly that we experienced in Vietnam where
[02:33:58.226 --> 02:34:05.698]  Well, the folks with the blue suits and the stars on their lapels tell the president, Hey, you know, we can bomb the hell out of these folks.
[02:34:05.818 --> 02:34:09.644]  And, uh, you know, we have these precision bombs and we can just do the job.
[02:34:09.704 --> 02:34:11.327]  Don't, don't have to worry about anything else.
[02:34:12.085 --> 02:34:30.736]  And so it seems to me that the first attempt will simply be bombing using stealth bombers and others and cruise missiles and so forth in hopes that enough of the known facilities having to do with nuclear facilities there in Iran will be taken out.
[02:34:31.436 --> 02:34:35.258]  What these folks never think of is what happens the next day, you know?
[02:34:35.718 --> 02:34:37.079]  And that's, I think, what you're asking.
[02:34:37.119 --> 02:34:38.720]  Well, what happens the next day is this.
[02:34:41.094 --> 02:34:55.597]  Iran is in command, and I mean in command, of a terrorist network worldwide that makes Al-Qaeda look like, you know, the Mount Sinai's volleyball team.
[02:34:56.038 --> 02:35:01.139]  These guys really can do a lot of damage, and they can do it here in this country as well.
[02:35:01.599 --> 02:35:02.419]  That's number one.
[02:35:03.129 --> 02:35:10.291]  Number two, they have sophisticated weaponry that can skim across the waves of the Gulf and sink ships like U.S.
[02:35:10.331 --> 02:35:11.431]  ships and other ships.
[02:35:11.571 --> 02:35:12.291]  Cruise missiles?
[02:35:12.711 --> 02:35:13.431]  Yeah.
[02:35:13.451 --> 02:35:18.072]  Well, actually, these are little line-of-sight missiles.
[02:35:18.592 --> 02:35:21.153]  They're very, very fast, and they're very, very effective.
[02:35:21.173 --> 02:35:22.833]  Is that the Exocet or Silkworm?
[02:35:23.834 --> 02:35:24.374]  They're both.
[02:35:24.934 --> 02:35:29.575]  The Silkworm was the latest, but now I understand there's an even more advanced version of that.
[02:35:30.325 --> 02:35:35.766]  And then finally, of course, those of you who have a little grainier here will relate to this.
[02:35:36.506 --> 02:35:43.707]  The Iranians can easily send three divisions of Revolutionary Guard troops right over the yellow, you know?
[02:35:44.307 --> 02:35:47.848]  By the yellow, I mean the long border with Iraq.
[02:35:48.128 --> 02:35:48.828]  And they'll fight!
[02:35:48.868 --> 02:35:53.649]  They had almost no real military hardware, and up against $30 billion of U.S.
[02:35:53.709 --> 02:35:54.909]  funding, beat Saddam.
[02:35:55.309 --> 02:35:55.729]  They did.
[02:35:55.969 --> 02:35:56.609]  Toe to toe.
[02:35:57.210 --> 02:35:59.050]  The problem is, you know, where are our guys?
[02:36:00.030 --> 02:36:15.116]  Our guys are all over Tikrit, and Baghdad, and Ramadi, and they're looking for terrorists, of course, and so they're not in any position to contend with an invasion of Iraq, an invasion welcomed by the local Sunni population.
[02:36:15.677 --> 02:36:16.977]  And so what's going to happen then?
[02:36:17.057 --> 02:36:25.801]  Well, my worst fear is that when that goes up, or that comes down, as we say these days, there's going to be an irresistible urge
[02:36:26.593 --> 02:36:27.754]  To use what we do have.
[02:36:28.094 --> 02:36:31.155]  And of course what we do have are these mini nukes.
[02:36:31.995 --> 02:36:38.418]  And this crowd makes no real distinction between high explosive weaponry and these little mini nukes.
[02:36:39.619 --> 02:36:41.640]  They're no big deal.
[02:36:41.740 --> 02:36:48.623]  And that will unleash a Pandora's box and will be a real key chain, not only in the immediate area, but
[02:36:49.096 --> 02:36:51.737]  Well, people like the Russians and people like the Chinese.
[02:36:51.857 --> 02:36:55.318]  Well, that's the point I wanted to bring up next, but let me just digress back with a few questions.
[02:36:55.378 --> 02:37:12.182]  Jack Straub, big neocon, pro-war, a few weeks ago he says openly, this is crazy, the words he used are your words, this is crazy to attack Iran, it'll be total destabilization, World War III, boom, he's forced to resign a day later.
[02:37:12.562 --> 02:37:15.843]  Yeah, you know, well that's what happens, you know, if you don't get with the program.
[02:37:17.325 --> 02:37:20.530]  Uh, you either get forced to resign or you do resign.
[02:37:20.551 --> 02:37:21.672]  This doesn't happen very much.
[02:37:21.692 --> 02:37:32.169]  But it's gotta be bad when even there's stalwarts like Strom, and we've had now eight generals, it's not six, there were two before him, eight generals come out and say that this is totally horrible.
[02:37:33.084 --> 02:37:35.928]  Mr. McGovern, we know that Rumsfeld isn't stupid.
[02:37:36.249 --> 02:37:37.571]  We know about P2oG.
[02:37:38.051 --> 02:37:41.997]  And clearly, you talked about when he's in trouble, widening something's the plan.
[02:37:42.357 --> 02:37:44.200]  They know Iran's going to go totally ape.
[02:37:44.621 --> 02:37:47.385]  They know there's going to be attacks all over the Middle East and the Western world.
[02:37:47.405 --> 02:37:48.827]  They'll call them all terrorist attacks.
[02:37:49.487 --> 02:38:00.974]  And then we're going to see Bush widen it, national draft, and then, oh, America's in trouble, our troops are being overrun, we've got to fully commit, I mean, isn't that really their plan?
[02:38:00.994 --> 02:38:10.200]  And then I think you will see Bush's approval ratings explode, because Americans will get behind the leader, but it'll be a crisis he puts us in the way of by design.
[02:38:10.220 --> 02:38:13.722]  I mean, sir, you're a great analyst, I agree with your analysis,
[02:38:14.082 --> 02:38:19.385]  I mean, don't you see there, or do you agree, or do you disagree, or give us your take, on they're doing this on purpose.
[02:38:19.425 --> 02:38:20.606]  They know what's going to happen.
[02:38:20.806 --> 02:38:23.127]  Their analysts are telling them what's going to happen.
[02:38:23.147 --> 02:38:24.688]  They know what you just said is true.
[02:38:24.968 --> 02:38:26.709]  So they understand this.
[02:38:27.589 --> 02:38:30.791]  Well, there are two things here, Alex.
[02:38:31.751 --> 02:38:34.553]  Hubris, arrogance, and ignorance.
[02:38:35.253 --> 02:38:38.355]  None of these guys know the first thing about military affairs.
[02:38:39.178 --> 02:38:46.722]  The only person that really served was Rumsfeld, and I think he was between Korea and Vietnam, never saw any real combat.
[02:38:46.782 --> 02:38:48.863]  Never involved in strategy, he just flew planes.
[02:38:49.103 --> 02:38:54.627]  Yeah, you know, so he's like McNamara, he knows it all, because he went to Ivy League school, that kind of stuff.
[02:38:55.447 --> 02:39:02.871]  The other thing is the President's approval ratings, or disapproval ratings, more correctly said, which you alluded to earlier on.
[02:39:03.471 --> 02:39:08.054]  And that has an awful lot to do with this, and has a lot to do with my fear that this will come soon.
[02:39:08.757 --> 02:39:11.499]  Look at them, they're on 28%, 29%.
[02:39:13.001 --> 02:39:17.805]  I can see Karl Rove saying, look, what you need to do is become a war president again.
[02:39:18.265 --> 02:39:29.034]  Get us involved in something pretty big here, and then strut around and say you can't vote for a bunch of Democrats to pull the rug out from under me while there's a war going on in November, you know, that kind of thing.
[02:39:29.514 --> 02:39:36.180]  So I see that as one of the primary incentives for them to unleash this thing, and again, they have no real
[02:39:36.621 --> 02:39:38.783]  They have no real expertise to draw on.
[02:39:38.803 --> 02:39:45.508]  I mean, we suggested and we pleaded with the President before the war in Iraq.
[02:39:46.188 --> 02:40:06.183]  On the same day as Colin Powell spoke, we finished our memo saying, Mr. President, we strongly urge you to broaden the circle of your advisors beyond those already bent on a war for which we see no cogent reason and from which we believe the unintended consequences are likely to be catastrophic.
[02:40:06.638 --> 02:40:25.111]  Now, you know, we take no delight in being right there, but we take great pain and great worry of seeing the circle narrowing even more, with not even Colin Powell, for whatever he was worth, he knew a couple things these others didn't, he's not even there again.
[02:40:25.571 --> 02:40:29.033]  And I just add this footnote here because it seems really relevant.
[02:40:30.514 --> 02:40:35.978]  The only time that, in my experience, I've been watching things for 43 years now in Washington,
[02:40:36.881 --> 02:41:04.465]  The only time we really came close to a nuclear exchange was during the Cuban Missile Crisis, and we avoided that primarily for one reason and one reason only, and that was that John Kennedy had the presence of mind to insist that Llewellyn Thompson, who had just retired from being ambassador to Moscow for a scathing eight years, okay, to insist that Llewellyn Thompson be there at every, every decision meeting, every consultation meeting.
[02:41:05.071 --> 02:41:18.336]  And so when Curtis LeMay, the head of the Air Force, had his nuclear weapons all loaded up in his bombers, and they were all set to take off, Llewellyn Thompson said, Sir, Mr. President, I do not agree.
[02:41:19.117 --> 02:41:21.437]  And everybody looked up, and he says, What'd you say?
[02:41:22.118 --> 02:41:23.458]  Mr. President, I disagree.
[02:41:23.858 --> 02:41:30.241]  And then John Kennedy listened to him, and what Llewellyn Thompson said was this, Look, you have two messages from Khrushchev,
[02:41:30.979 --> 02:41:38.041]  One is a conciliatory one, one is a bellicose one, probably done with the generals looking over his shoulder.
[02:41:38.642 --> 02:41:39.782]  Respond to the first one.
[02:41:40.102 --> 02:41:45.884]  I'll bet you, Mr. President, that he's looking for an easy way to get out of this mess that he created for himself.
[02:41:46.364 --> 02:41:49.645]  Kennedy said, we'll go with Llewellyn's plan for the time being.
[02:41:50.105 --> 02:41:51.366]  You know the rest of the story.
[02:41:51.906 --> 02:41:53.207]  Why am I mentioning this?
[02:41:53.387 --> 02:41:57.328]  We got a conciliatory message from the Iranian president.
[02:41:57.748 --> 02:41:59.189]  Yeah, we do, okay?
[02:41:59.209 --> 02:42:03.351]  And it's, you know, the parallel is really intriguing.
[02:42:03.832 --> 02:42:13.517]  Because the bottom line is, Alex, and this is really scary... The bottom line is they... the Iranian president lost a lot of face doing that.
[02:42:13.557 --> 02:42:16.919]  They'd never done that before, and Bush didn't even read it before they responded.
[02:42:17.472 --> 02:42:27.802]  Exactly, and from our side, there just ain't no Llewellyn Thompson around now, and if there were, he'd not be permitted anywhere near the inner circle of the presidency.
[02:42:27.862 --> 02:42:40.073]  So, we have Cheney and Rumsfeld, we have the cabal that is so well described by Colin Powell's Chief of State, Larry Wilkerson, they're making all the decisions, and they're the ones responsible for Iraq.
[02:42:41.741 --> 02:42:45.826]  You know, in a lighter vein, Alex, I have a solution.
[02:42:46.026 --> 02:42:48.770]  What we ought to do is have Congress pass a bill
[02:42:49.634 --> 02:42:59.781]  Making it unlawful for President Bush to attack any country whose president has a name that Bush can't pronounce.
[02:43:00.962 --> 02:43:07.646]  That should give us a couple of weeks at least, and, you know, it would be... Ahmet Ajan, I have trouble pronouncing it.
[02:43:08.066 --> 02:43:12.269]  I do too, but it would take our president for a while to do that.
[02:43:12.649 --> 02:43:13.450]  No, seriously.
[02:43:13.590 --> 02:43:15.572]  It's a very, very serious situation.
[02:43:15.652 --> 02:43:18.855]  Congress is willing to let Rumsfeld do what he wants.
[02:43:19.015 --> 02:43:20.217]  I mean, he's got U.S.
[02:43:20.277 --> 02:43:29.686]  Marines inside Iran now without any allusion to... Well, this is like Hitler turning east and going up against Russia when he had problems.
[02:43:29.726 --> 02:43:34.931]  We've now gotten the documents of Goebbels and Goering and, of course, Himmler's debates.
[02:43:35.591 --> 02:43:40.835]  And so they wanted to expand it, really on the domestic front, to quote, have some victories.
[02:43:41.315 --> 02:43:44.758]  Iran is 63 million people versus 22 million people.
[02:43:45.138 --> 02:43:48.360]  Geographically, what, it's two or three times bigger.
[02:43:49.041 --> 02:43:50.642]  And these people are going to fight.
[02:43:50.762 --> 02:44:00.208]  I guess the neocons, if they're not trying to create a big crisis to widen something, maybe they think there'll be some domestic uprising, CIA manipulated replay of Kermit Roosevelt in 1953.
[02:44:00.769 --> 02:44:02.730]  But that brings me to false flag.
[02:44:03.533 --> 02:44:08.335]  You know, you've said that the mosque bombing, some of the things we've seen have Western intelligence written all over it.
[02:44:08.795 --> 02:44:30.144]  What about our own governments, or someone in the government, or a private group, staging some event, and then claiming Iran has carried it out as a prelude to attacking Iran, or even once Iran is attacked, intelligence agencies launching something in Europe or the U.S., and then claiming Iran did that.
[02:44:30.164 --> 02:44:30.865]  Your take on that?
[02:44:33.024 --> 02:44:34.886]  Well, Alex, that's altogether possible.
[02:44:35.606 --> 02:44:46.995]  That's altogether possible, and I would say even probable, because they would need some proximate cause, some Causus Belli, to justify really unleashing things on Iran.
[02:44:47.556 --> 02:44:51.739]  And that would help, of course, and I would put very little past this crew.
[02:44:54.668 --> 02:44:59.911]  Record of dissembling and disingenuousness is unparalleled.
[02:45:00.211 --> 02:45:02.872]  Well look at the, which I'm glad you brought up on national TV.
[02:45:02.892 --> 02:45:04.213]  I brought it up on CNN as well.
[02:45:04.233 --> 02:45:09.055]  We're the only two that have done it and gotten through the Berlin Wall of media control, the Iron Curtain.
[02:45:09.596 --> 02:45:13.258]  But the White House memo is much more important than Downing Street.
[02:45:13.538 --> 02:45:21.302]  I mean, we have them talking about painting up a plane like a UN plane and trying to get it shot down or saying a defector found WMDs.
[02:45:21.382 --> 02:45:23.563]  I mean, these guys, that is the smoking gun.
[02:45:24.183 --> 02:45:24.664]  That's right.
[02:45:25.024 --> 02:45:34.092]  And, you know, the whole thing was that they knew that there weren't weapons of mass destruction, so they're going to have to do something else or something to hasten the process of doing a war.
[02:45:34.432 --> 02:45:38.556]  Let me say another word, Alex, about the electoral business here.
[02:45:38.576 --> 02:45:47.063]  The stakes could not be larger for this administration, because if the Democrats take the House in November,
[02:45:48.130 --> 02:45:51.913]  There will be, in my view, impeachment proceedings for sure.
[02:45:52.074 --> 02:45:54.416]  I've had two congressmen on this show say that as well.
[02:45:54.476 --> 02:45:58.699]  It's 100% impeachment, then the whole crime cabal will get blown.
[02:45:58.939 --> 02:45:59.720]  That's exactly right.
[02:45:59.740 --> 02:46:01.962]  There'll be investigations for the next two years.
[02:46:02.062 --> 02:46:04.164]  Now, those could be consequential.
[02:46:04.444 --> 02:46:11.230]  I mean, people can get impeached, but also people could get thrown into jail, as we saw last week with the Enron types.
[02:46:11.290 --> 02:46:12.451]  Kinley, six counts.
[02:46:12.631 --> 02:46:15.413]  Yeah, so there's a lot riding on this thing.
[02:46:16.821 --> 02:46:25.086]  Uh, it behooves the President, or, you know, I'm sure Cheney, Gonzalez, Rove, and the rest of them are saying, Mr. President, we've got to prevent this at any cost.
[02:46:25.166 --> 02:46:32.991]  And if it means, you know, using our smart weaponry to do the job on Iran, well, let's just go ahead and do it.
[02:46:34.071 --> 02:46:35.712]  Consult people like Ken Edelman.
[02:46:35.752 --> 02:46:38.233]  I'm sure he'll tell us that it'll be a cakewalk again.
[02:46:38.373 --> 02:46:39.273]  What about Israel?
[02:46:39.313 --> 02:46:46.736]  I mean, we noticed it was the ADL out of Canada that first put out the fake report of Jews having to wear basically yellow stars.
[02:46:46.796 --> 02:46:48.436]  Again, total lie now, folks.
[02:46:48.776 --> 02:46:50.397]  Totally retracted, but quietly.
[02:46:51.037 --> 02:46:53.318]  Why is Israel jumping up and down?
[02:46:53.478 --> 02:46:55.919]  Why do they want an attack on Iran?
[02:46:55.959 --> 02:46:58.120]  I mean, they're not really threatened by Iran right now.
[02:46:58.180 --> 02:46:58.380]  Why?
[02:46:59.180 --> 02:47:00.921]  Well, there are two things here.
[02:47:01.001 --> 02:47:03.643]  First, we need to be a little careful when we talk about Israel.
[02:47:03.683 --> 02:47:08.006]  This is a clique of right-wing Likud types.
[02:47:08.026 --> 02:47:08.586]  No, I understand.
[02:47:08.626 --> 02:47:09.967]  I'm talking about the leadership, though.
[02:47:10.187 --> 02:47:12.248]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:47:12.348 --> 02:47:22.875]  And they, you know, they are kind of way out in front, and what I would emphasize is that they are incredibly short-sighted.
[02:47:23.535 --> 02:47:25.056]  Look what happened in Iraq, you know?
[02:47:25.456 --> 02:47:28.398]  If part of the objective, which I'm convinced it was,
[02:47:28.925 --> 02:47:31.367]  Was to make Israel more secure.
[02:47:32.067 --> 02:47:35.510]  Well, you know, there weren't any terrorists in Iraq before we invaded there.
[02:47:35.570 --> 02:47:37.231]  Now it's teeming with terrorists.
[02:47:37.512 --> 02:47:40.074]  All, a lot of them, out to do Israel in.
[02:47:40.254 --> 02:47:40.574]  Okay?
[02:47:41.034 --> 02:47:41.895]  So that's one thing.
[02:47:42.796 --> 02:47:55.966]  The other thing is that, you know, from a general perspective, the Israelis do not want to take any chances that any country, especially Iran, would erode its nuclear monopoly in the Middle East.
[02:47:56.471 --> 02:47:59.192]  They have 300 to 400 nuclear weapons there.
[02:47:59.633 --> 02:48:11.058]  Nobody mentions that, but they want to keep that monopoly and they see it as a big infringement on their security were Iran to get even just one or two weapons.
[02:48:11.219 --> 02:48:20.403]  Now, you know, Ahmadinejad makes it easy for the Israelis to raise the flag and say, look, they're going to zomp us as soon as they get a weapon.
[02:48:20.783 --> 02:48:23.705]  I don't think it will happen because that would be suicide for Iran.
[02:48:25.311 --> 02:48:26.372]  Ahmed Dinejad.
[02:48:26.533 --> 02:48:34.701]  I want to talk about if you were Ahmed Dinejad or Dinejad, what would Ray McGovern do if you were Ahmed Dinejad?
[02:48:35.062 --> 02:48:37.424]  What would you do right now to try to avert this?
[02:48:37.985 --> 02:48:42.650]  And in closing, what do you think Iran and China are going to do when and if this attack takes place?
[02:48:46.059 --> 02:48:54.328]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here and I'm excited to announce we're going to have a huge 9-11 conference in downtown Los Angeles on the 24th and 25th of June.
[02:48:54.528 --> 02:48:56.871]  We're expecting around 1,000 people in attendance.
[02:48:57.451 --> 02:49:06.321]  At this historic event, we will irrefutably document that 9-11 was an inside job, a self-inflicted wound, a false flag terror operation.
[02:49:06.821 --> 02:49:10.322]  The conference is titled 9-11 and the Neocon Agenda.
[02:49:10.802 --> 02:49:31.570]  I'm happy to announce the conference will feature presentations by incredible speakers like BYU physics professor Stephen Jones, the father of the Star Wars program, Lieutenant Colonel Robert Bowman, former top-level CIA analyst for Reagan and Bush, Ray McGovern, 9-11 hero William Rodriguez, author Webster Charnley, Professor Jim Fetzer, and many, many others, including special guests.
[02:49:31.890 --> 02:49:35.651]  I'll also be debuting my explosive new film, Terror Storm, at the conference.
[02:49:47.899 --> 02:49:59.146]  Now you can enjoy the most delicious, freshest, and healthiest drinking water anytime, even while traveling, during outdoor sporting activities, and in hospital filtration environments such as local or national emergencies.
[02:49:59.387 --> 02:50:02.869]  The revolutionary Berkey Light removes pathogenic bacteria
[02:50:03.129 --> 02:50:07.351]  Cysts, parasites and harmful or unwanted chemicals to below detectable levels.
[02:50:07.631 --> 02:50:11.553]  It also removes foul tastes and odors like that rotten egg smell of sulfide.
[02:50:11.793 --> 02:50:18.316]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals your body needs.
[02:50:18.536 --> 02:50:24.018]  The Berkey Light is so powerful it can purify raw untreated water from remote lake streams and stagnant ponds.
[02:50:24.258 --> 02:50:31.183]  The Berkey Light is transparent and glows in the dark with its rechargeable LED lighting system so it can be used as a night light or camp light.
[02:50:31.403 --> 02:50:35.426]  Get the Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:50:35.466 --> 02:50:38.067]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438 or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[02:50:38.087 --> 02:50:39.268]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:50:47.364 --> 02:50:47.684]  I think so.
[02:51:02.592 --> 02:51:03.252]  We're good to go!
[02:51:32.108 --> 02:51:35.211]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[02:51:35.372 --> 02:51:41.238]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[02:51:47.741 --> 02:51:50.364]  Alright, Alex Jones here back live at Genesis Communications.
[02:51:50.385 --> 02:51:54.250]  I'm going to ask Ray McGovern to grace us with another 5 minutes into the next hour.
[02:51:54.270 --> 02:51:57.776]  I'm going to run a rebroadcast of a pastor we had on last week.
[02:51:57.816 --> 02:51:58.657]  We have the documents.
[02:51:59.218 --> 02:52:01.080]  They're openly recruited pastors in 13,000 counties.
[02:52:03.425 --> 02:52:09.453]  Tens of thousands, around 25% in each county, to prepare their flocks for martial law, as the CIA called it.
[02:52:09.793 --> 02:52:13.939]  It's white propaganda where you have people who are well-known and respected and trusted.
[02:52:13.959 --> 02:52:17.764]  They're openly telling them gun confiscation, martial law, total control.
[02:52:18.344 --> 02:52:21.669]  And I think that's what this is really all about, is getting us into a crisis so big,
[02:52:22.603 --> 02:52:25.446]  That domestically, they can take over as well.
[02:52:25.906 --> 02:52:33.533]  Ray McGovern, can you comment on all of the preparations we've seen for domestic SCSI-type operations, sir?
[02:52:34.814 --> 02:52:35.935]  Not in five minutes, Alex.
[02:52:36.415 --> 02:52:37.836]  Well, I mean, just briefly?
[02:52:38.116 --> 02:52:40.058]  No, I'm sorry, the list is very long.
[02:52:41.019 --> 02:52:46.724]  I'll tell you one that hit really close to home, and one that people don't know about.
[02:52:47.244 --> 02:52:48.986]  In the Intelligence Authorization Bill,
[02:52:49.938 --> 02:53:16.481]  Pete Hoekstra, the head of the House Intelligence Committee, he put in a provision which says this, the Director of National Intelligence shall prepare a study in 90 days to determine whether he, under existing authorities, can suspend the pensions of CIA pensioners
[02:53:17.297 --> 02:53:23.182]  For talking about classified material, or whether he needs additional authorities.
[02:53:23.883 --> 02:53:27.166]  Now, that's creeping fascism right there.
[02:53:27.206 --> 02:53:34.972]  In other words, they determine what's classified information, and if that gets passed, I'm not going to be able to talk on your radio program anymore.
[02:53:34.992 --> 02:53:39.496]  I'll be labeled liable to be wrapped up here in some sort of dragnet.
[02:53:40.086 --> 02:53:41.787]  So that's the kind of thing that's happening.
[02:53:41.987 --> 02:53:57.211]  On the NSA thing, if you probably know, Congressman Hinchey from New York asked the Justice Department to look into what advice the Justice Department had given NSA to say that that thing was legal, and guess what happened?
[02:53:57.651 --> 02:54:09.035]  After two months, the Justice Department responded to Congressman Hinchey saying, sorry, we have to drop the investigation because NSA will not give us the clearances we need to investigate NSA.
[02:54:09.744 --> 02:54:11.904]  That's happened now with the FCC as well.
[02:54:12.185 --> 02:54:19.066]  And that's dictatorship when they say, oh, the military or this government arm is telling us in enforcement what we can do.
[02:54:19.126 --> 02:54:22.467]  What do you see happening with Iran and Syria?
[02:54:23.127 --> 02:54:26.288]  If Iran is attacked, what do you think Russia and China will do?
[02:54:26.568 --> 02:54:30.989]  We know Russia just sold a bunch of high-tech anti-aircraft systems to Iran.
[02:54:32.049 --> 02:54:37.470]  Well, I think that if I were Ahmadinejad, I would be asking the Chinese and the Russians for some sort of
[02:54:38.150 --> 02:54:39.230]  Military support.
[02:54:39.911 --> 02:54:45.553]  Some sort of pledge that they won't stand idly by to watch this kind of exercise.
[02:54:47.573 --> 02:54:50.654]  What Ahmadinejad has already done was quite unprecedented.
[02:54:50.714 --> 02:54:55.216]  First time in 27 years that they communicated with us that long letter.
[02:54:55.676 --> 02:54:58.797]  I advise everyone to download that letter and read it.
[02:54:58.877 --> 02:55:00.898]  It's really quite ironic sighting.
[02:55:01.314 --> 02:55:08.038]  Bush's professed Christianity and asking him to square that with the behavior that he's exhibited.
[02:55:08.298 --> 02:55:09.139]  What else would you do?
[02:55:09.499 --> 02:55:13.982]  I'd try to capture some of those folks that are in his country now.
[02:55:14.362 --> 02:55:22.347]  They've already captured some of the dissidents, and there are lots of them, that are being run by our covert operatives.
[02:55:22.507 --> 02:55:24.689]  Not CIA types, but defense types.
[02:55:25.473 --> 02:55:29.198]  And I'd warn the Azerbaijanis, you know.
[02:55:29.238 --> 02:55:42.934]  The Azerbaijanis, that ethnic group, comprises about 20-25% of the Iranian nation, and they are being egged on by all manner of folks supported by us.
[02:55:43.624 --> 02:55:55.150]  I would warn the Azerbaijani government that if they let the US or anybody else, UK, use their country as a platform for this sort of thing, that they can expect some retaliation from Iran.
[02:55:55.250 --> 02:55:58.931]  And that's a credible threat, because Iran has that capability.
[02:55:59.272 --> 02:56:04.114]  Then I'd seek support from the other states in the area, because this would be beyond the pale.
[02:56:04.454 --> 02:56:05.975]  They really need that kind of extra support.
[02:56:06.733 --> 02:56:08.033]  Ray McGovern, a one-minute break.
[02:56:08.073 --> 02:56:10.294]  When we get back, we'll spend five final minutes with you.
[02:56:10.334 --> 02:56:12.454]  We really appreciate the time on this Memorial Day.
[02:56:12.954 --> 02:56:14.535]  This is such an important issue.
[02:56:14.955 --> 02:56:19.096]  World War III is upon us, or as the neocons call it, World War IV.
[02:56:19.536 --> 02:56:22.597]  They believe the Cold War was World War III, but this is a hot war.
[02:56:22.897 --> 02:56:23.597]  We'll be right back.
[02:56:25.977 --> 02:56:30.578]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-376-45.
