[00:00:05.783 --> 00:00:06.424]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.084 --> 00:00:08.145]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.865 --> 00:00:09.986]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.626 --> 00:00:11.447]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.227 --> 00:00:13.128]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.808 --> 00:00:17.550]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.991 --> 00:00:22.133]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:27.036 --> 00:00:28.037]  Welcome, my friends.
[00:00:28.137 --> 00:00:30.358]  It is Tuesday, the third day of October, 2016.
[00:00:32.588 --> 00:00:34.630]  We're going to be live for the next three hours.
[00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:38.272]  We have a professor joining us, a professor of law.
[00:00:39.393 --> 00:00:43.596]  Wrote the story, a constitutional shredding, rounding up U.S.
[00:00:43.836 --> 00:00:44.477]  citizens.
[00:00:44.997 --> 00:00:48.140]  Marjorie Cohn will be joining us.
[00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:52.403]  The professor will be coming on to talk about how this affects U.S.
[00:00:52.443 --> 00:00:54.785]  citizens and is the end of the U.S.
[00:00:54.825 --> 00:00:56.806]  Constitution in its entirety.
[00:00:56.846 --> 00:00:59.188]  The Bill of Rights completely torched.
[00:01:01.045 --> 00:01:04.246]  Now, again, that doesn't mean that it's actually in effect.
[00:01:04.326 --> 00:01:10.809]  It proves that our government is totally rogue, completely and absolutely illegitimate and criminal.
[00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:17.831]  It'd be like if, say, Russian special forces came into D.C.
[00:01:18.712 --> 00:01:30.176]  in troop transports camouflaged as jumbo jets and the noses popped off and thousands of troops poured out with armored vehicles and took over the capitol.
[00:01:31.357 --> 00:01:31.858]  We're good to go.
[00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:56.260]  Neocon coup.
[00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.682]  And they're up there telling us that we must do everything they say.
[00:01:59.983 --> 00:02:01.444]  That we have no due process.
[00:02:01.464 --> 00:02:02.705]  That our Bill of Rights is gone.
[00:02:03.045 --> 00:02:05.247]  We must give all allegiance unto them.
[00:02:06.167 --> 00:02:07.168]  That's dictatorship.
[00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:09.670]  Go read the Declaration of Independence.
[00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:11.151]  We're dealing with terrorists.
[00:02:11.571 --> 00:02:13.353]  The government is run by terrorists.
[00:02:14.073 --> 00:02:15.875]  We are the people of the United States.
[00:02:16.055 --> 00:02:16.975]  They are illegitimate.
[00:02:16.995 --> 00:02:20.558]  And it's time to start looking at it from that perspective.
[00:02:20.798 --> 00:02:21.239]  Period.
[00:02:21.279 --> 00:02:23.100]  They have officially done it.
[00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.701]  The Bill of Rights has been abolished.
[00:02:26.901 --> 00:02:39.688]  What, four years ago they introduced legislation in Arizona that came very close to passing that they would secede if the Bill of Rights was overturned, if gun confiscation began, if a new world order was announced.
[00:02:39.728 --> 00:02:40.348]  That was in the bill.
[00:02:40.728 --> 00:02:42.469]  Well, okay, Arizona, pull out.
[00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:45.431]  Okay, New Hampshire, Article 10, right to revolt.
[00:02:46.011 --> 00:02:47.732]  You were pulling out the week before 9-11.
[00:02:48.392 --> 00:02:49.893]  They were set to secede.
[00:02:50.894 --> 00:02:51.394]  We're good to go.
[00:02:51.414 --> 00:02:51.695]  I think?
[00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.171]  They are the traitors.
[00:03:23.291 --> 00:03:25.711]  They are the lecherous scoundrels.
[00:03:25.751 --> 00:03:27.112]  Go read the federal laws.
[00:03:27.372 --> 00:03:28.412]  Go read the Constitution.
[00:03:28.612 --> 00:03:29.553]  Go read the Bill of Rights.
[00:03:29.593 --> 00:03:31.473]  Go read the Federalist, Anti-Federalist papers.
[00:03:31.814 --> 00:03:34.014]  This is classical tyranny.
[00:03:34.435 --> 00:03:38.876]  This is an administrative coup d'etat.
[00:03:40.177 --> 00:03:40.777]  A putsch.
[00:03:41.937 --> 00:03:42.477]  A junta.
[00:03:43.058 --> 00:03:45.779]  This is the real deal.
[00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:49.860]  You have now witnessed total tyranny.
[00:03:51.002 --> 00:03:55.365]  You know, for years, I met him out at the Project Censor Awards back in 2004, and I've never had him on.
[00:03:55.385 --> 00:03:56.685]  I met him coming on Thursday.
[00:03:57.206 --> 00:04:00.127]  Fatal Vision, the deeper evil behind the detainee bill.
[00:04:00.168 --> 00:04:02.549]  Chris Floyd, writes for major papers worldwide.
[00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:05.851]  We're going to read part of his article.
[00:04:05.871 --> 00:04:08.653]  Another headline here.
[00:04:09.193 --> 00:04:11.374]  Bye, Marjorie Cohen is joining us in the next hour.
[00:04:11.494 --> 00:04:13.155]  Bush can now grab and imprison any U.S.
[00:04:13.175 --> 00:04:13.996]  citizen he chooses.
[00:04:15.917 --> 00:04:17.638]  And Paul Watson and I have written a good article.
[00:04:18.749 --> 00:04:24.513]  It's will Americans seek repeal of Constitution Killing Enabling Act?
[00:04:25.813 --> 00:04:32.137]  Or are Mark Foley's perverted emails more important to the existence of freedom in the United States?
[00:04:32.337 --> 00:04:34.278]  And the answer is, of course, they're not.
[00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:38.381]  Breast cancer is up by 80%.
[00:04:40.182 --> 00:04:41.743]  North Korea is going to test and nuke.
[00:04:43.855 --> 00:04:48.199]  Bush says he's going to federalize the schools, basically, to keep you safe from school shooters.
[00:04:48.339 --> 00:04:52.884]  Suddenly, people go into schools and start raping and blowing little girls' heads off.
[00:04:53.264 --> 00:04:55.126]  This is so staged, it's a joke.
[00:04:56.247 --> 00:04:56.948]  The Amish.
[00:04:57.688 --> 00:04:58.189]  Ah, yes.
[00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:02.192]  We've talked about how they are a major mind-control operation.
[00:05:02.212 --> 00:05:02.653]  We'll be right back.
[00:05:04.071 --> 00:05:04.731]  Hello, folks.

[00:06:08.441 --> 00:06:14.962]  Ethos FR, a product used all over the world, has reported savings of up to 19% on gas and even reduced emissions of up to 30%.
[00:06:15.702 --> 00:06:20.443]  Ethos FR is easy to use and works with any kind of fuel, including gasoline, diesel, and ethanol.

[00:06:34.631 --> 00:06:37.113]  Are your Federal Reserve notes looking for a safe haven?
[00:06:37.593 --> 00:06:39.514]  Mine found it in precious metals.
[00:06:40.215 --> 00:06:43.397]  Not paper promises, but actual gold in my possession.
[00:06:44.057 --> 00:06:50.562]  It is liquid, it is private, it owes no one, it cannot go bankrupt, and it maintains its purchasing power.
[00:06:51.342 --> 00:06:53.564]  Find your answer at Midas Resources.
[00:06:53.944 --> 00:06:54.384]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:06:54.464 --> 00:06:55.865]  The answer is at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:07:04.077 --> 00:07:06.260]  Admit it, the moral rot in America runs deep.
[00:07:06.661 --> 00:07:13.290]  Massive debt, rampant materialism, pedophilia by clergy, endless war, and yes, the sin of religious cannibalism.
[00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:19.979]  Communion was practiced by the Aztecs, Egyptians, Babylonians, and Gnostics of the mystery schools long before the Messiah was born.
[00:07:20.339 --> 00:07:24.921]  Due to carefully placed forgeries within the New Covenant texts, the worship of pagan gods prevailed.
[00:07:25.221 --> 00:07:30.684]  The Church's sacred cannibalism service, known as Communion, is based upon words the Messiah never said.
[00:07:30.964 --> 00:07:32.265]  The Savior was no cannibal.
[00:07:32.545 --> 00:07:33.706]  He lived and taught the Torah.
[00:07:34.026 --> 00:07:34.506]  See proof?
[00:07:34.766 --> 00:07:35.266]  Get the book.
[00:07:35.526 --> 00:07:37.467]  Communion, Bloodfest of Babylon Today.
[00:07:37.788 --> 00:07:40.609]  Write to Two Witnesses Ministries, PO Box 2453, Abilene, Texas.
[00:07:43.030 --> 00:07:43.351]  Call 325-572-3913.
[00:08:04.736 --> 00:08:10.780]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:14.462]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:27.810 --> 00:08:30.972]  I remember studying official U.S.
[00:08:31.012 --> 00:08:33.053]  government mind control programs...
[00:08:35.516 --> 00:08:54.991]  Oh, going back 14 years ago was when I started researching, and it's a topic I don't talk a lot about on air because it's one of those areas that the general public has a lot of problems dealing with, and that if I was really ever going to talk about it in any breadth or width, that I would want to really spend time on all the details.
[00:08:56.492 --> 00:08:59.134]  But because of the rash of school shootings...
[00:09:00.007 --> 00:09:05.171]  In the last week, it needs to be discussed now here on air.
[00:09:05.211 --> 00:09:07.533]  So I will spend a little bit of time on this now.
[00:09:08.194 --> 00:09:11.777]  I'm going to get into North Korea saying they're going to do a nuclear test.
[00:09:13.118 --> 00:09:14.619]  Very serious escalation.
[00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:16.921]  Of course, that's not a problem.
[00:09:16.941 --> 00:09:18.302]  We just need to attack Iran.
[00:09:19.703 --> 00:09:24.707]  Also, the Daily Mail is reporting out of England that breast cancer is up 80%.
[00:09:26.798 --> 00:09:35.364]  Folks, every form of cancer is up, many of them up several thousand percent, and we'll get into why this is really happening, and it's only going to get worse and worse.
[00:09:37.326 --> 00:09:43.891]  And then there's an incredible report put out by Chris Floyd, Fatal Vision, the Deeper Evil Behind the Detainee Bill.
[00:09:43.931 --> 00:09:46.472]  He writes for British Papers, the Moscow Times.
[00:09:46.492 --> 00:09:49.294]  He's a globally syndicated columnist.
[00:09:49.314 --> 00:09:52.397]  He's going to be joining us Thursday, but I want to go over this report.
[00:09:52.437 --> 00:09:53.898]  There's more on Pervert Foley.
[00:09:55.886 --> 00:10:01.291]  Different congressmen supplying in with pages for private dinners.
[00:10:02.011 --> 00:10:03.332]  This is how they operate.
[00:10:03.352 --> 00:10:05.074]  It's the little gifts they give each other.
[00:10:05.914 --> 00:10:09.677]  It's part of the Christian conservative republicanism that I keep telling you about.
[00:10:11.078 --> 00:10:15.602]  Frankly, from my research, I would say more than half of them are homosexual.
[00:10:16.343 --> 00:10:18.925]  And probably about 20% of that group are pedophiles.
[00:10:19.825 --> 00:10:23.048]  And the rest are involved in other forms of corruption.
[00:10:23.869 --> 00:10:26.350]  We're good to go.
[00:10:44.853 --> 00:10:51.416]  Well, remember, waiting for his... He'd had his sentencing, and he was supposed to report to prison in a couple months.
[00:10:51.456 --> 00:10:53.977]  They gave him a few months before he had to go to prison, and that was pretty bizarre.
[00:10:54.637 --> 00:11:00.239]  Ken Lay, and then he has this little heart attack up there in Colorado, up at Vail.
[00:11:00.279 --> 00:11:01.600]  I think that's where he died.
[00:11:03.261 --> 00:11:03.521]  Sure.
[00:11:04.921 --> 00:11:08.303]  Just like the other Enron employees who would say, I've got to get a bodyguard.
[00:11:08.343 --> 00:11:09.343]  I'm going to buy a gun.
[00:11:09.383 --> 00:11:13.705]  And they're found dead in their underwear a block from their house in the median with...
[00:11:14.955 --> 00:11:16.337]  Gunshot wounds to their head.
[00:11:20.483 --> 00:11:28.756]  Arthur Anderson, two of their accountants were found dead in the woods, heads blown off, but again, it's all suicide.
[00:11:31.579 --> 00:11:45.410]  By the way, I don't want to digress, but speaking of political assassination, we don't just have Princess Diana telling her bodyguard, telling her friends, making a videotape and putting it in her will, that Prince Charles had told her two months before that I'm going to kill you and it's going to look like an auto accident.
[00:11:46.291 --> 00:11:56.459]  Now one of the chief witnesses, a French driver driving home to meet his wife, a very credible source, saw over ten people waiting in the tunnel.
[00:11:57.580 --> 00:11:58.941]  I can't pronounce it in French.
[00:11:59.001 --> 00:11:59.482]  I won't try.
[00:11:59.522 --> 00:12:00.302]  My wife will get mad.
[00:12:00.322 --> 00:12:01.163]  She speaks more in French.
[00:12:03.172 --> 00:12:23.927]  The Champs Elysees or whatever it is, that tunnel, and there's these ten individuals standing there in the tunnel in suits waiting for her about a minute before she crashed and died right there.
[00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:27.942]  And, of course, they kept her there for hours and stood over.
[00:12:28.022 --> 00:12:33.826]  And then the ambulance drove at 30 miles an hour for 45 minutes to its location.
[00:12:33.886 --> 00:12:40.230]  And the cameras all turned off in the tunnel one minute before the crash and turned towards the concrete wall.
[00:12:40.271 --> 00:12:42.312]  They turned towards the wall and then turned off.
[00:12:43.095 --> 00:12:50.001]  But again, Dr. David Kelly was seen with five men in black uniforms around him by the police as they approached.
[00:12:50.041 --> 00:12:52.023]  The men ran off in the black uniforms.
[00:12:52.363 --> 00:12:57.087]  His wrists were slit with no blood at the scene and two undigested pills in his stomach.
[00:12:57.348 --> 00:12:58.549]  They claim that's how he died.
[00:13:00.931 --> 00:13:05.535]  And top coroners in England have gone public saying he was clearly murdered.
[00:13:08.237 --> 00:13:12.059]  I say all of this because you can tell people, hey, I'm going to be murdered.
[00:13:12.079 --> 00:13:13.219]  They told me they're going to kill me.
[00:13:13.239 --> 00:13:14.320]  And then they kill you.
[00:13:14.340 --> 00:13:17.381]  They'll shoot you twice in the head and say, well, he committed suicide.
[00:13:18.461 --> 00:13:22.763]  What they do is they, you know, you walk into your house at night, and they say, okay, guns on you.
[00:13:23.223 --> 00:13:23.963]  Go sit down over there.
[00:13:23.983 --> 00:13:25.004]  I'm going to put you in handcuffs.
[00:13:25.044 --> 00:13:27.345]  Usually two or three guys, they put you in handcuffs.
[00:13:28.105 --> 00:13:30.026]  And then they say, okay, here's what's going to happen.
[00:13:30.546 --> 00:13:37.309]  You're going to fill out this will, basically this last will and testament, this final statement,
[00:13:38.567 --> 00:13:41.349]  The reason you're committing suicide or we're going to kill your whole family.
[00:13:41.689 --> 00:13:42.470]  How does that sound?
[00:13:44.091 --> 00:13:47.493]  Then they say, here's a picture of a guy we killed in Indonesia.
[00:13:48.573 --> 00:13:49.974]  We killed him after we killed his family.
[00:13:49.994 --> 00:13:51.115]  Here's pictures of the dead kids.
[00:13:51.495 --> 00:13:52.315]  Do you understand?
[00:13:52.876 --> 00:13:57.558]  Write it and make it convincing or your whole family's dead.
[00:13:57.578 --> 00:13:58.119]  Do you understand?
[00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:02.221]  And that's the kind of stuff they do with people like Gary Webb.
[00:14:06.363 --> 00:14:11.047]  I said I'd get into school shootings and mind control.
[00:14:12.548 --> 00:14:17.112]  Mind control is as real a science as hydrography.
[00:14:18.813 --> 00:14:22.576]  The study, I guess, of currents is what hydrography is.
[00:14:23.356 --> 00:14:32.123]  It's as real as nuclear physics or quantum mechanics or architecture.
[00:14:33.584 --> 00:14:35.366]  It's as real as calculus.
[00:14:36.705 --> 00:14:38.787]  Or machine tooling.
[00:14:40.809 --> 00:14:42.090]  It's been developed.
[00:14:42.910 --> 00:14:49.456]  Oh, going back thousands of years ago, they had specially trained and socially conditioned assassins.
[00:14:49.476 --> 00:14:50.577]  500 years ago in Japan.
[00:14:54.168 --> 00:15:19.925]  They would take the ninja, that was just one school of assassins, and they would take a young boy, and then by the time he was 18 he had been trained, he had been addicted to opium, he'd also been addicted to high quality ladies of the night, but really you wouldn't even call them prostitutes, they were just house trainees, women trainees, women trainers, but the most beautiful in Japan.
[00:15:20.831 --> 00:15:31.696]  And with sex and drugs and then high agility and military training, he would be conditioned in that cult, that death cult, to commit one assassination.
[00:15:32.737 --> 00:15:48.785]  And in the Hollywood movies, you see the ninja kills itself by committing seppuku, stabbing themselves with a long dagger in the stomach, short sword, and then cutting across and then up into the heart, jabbing,
[00:15:49.612 --> 00:15:50.772]  It's a self-control thing.
[00:15:50.832 --> 00:15:51.712]  Quite proud of themselves.
[00:15:52.113 --> 00:15:53.993]  Jabbing the sword into the heart.
[00:15:55.493 --> 00:16:14.557]  The ninja would simply then get rid of themselves after the one assassination they were appointed to commit because that then protected whoever had paid the incredible sum of money for a ninja attack.
[00:16:14.717 --> 00:16:16.298]  A ninja assassination.
[00:16:18.078 --> 00:16:18.218]  And
[00:16:19.025 --> 00:16:37.112]  When you introduce drugs and torture and conditioning and a bunch of other different techniques, you can produce totally hypnotized, mind-controlled assassins.
[00:16:38.113 --> 00:16:40.954]  And a lot of this came out in 77 with the declassification.
[00:16:41.659 --> 00:16:43.080]  I think we're good to go.
[00:17:03.630 --> 00:17:07.751]  And then I even saw it about six years ago on History Channel, an hour-long special.
[00:17:07.771 --> 00:17:13.353]  I was amazed to see it on there, that Dr. Ewing Cameron was the head of the U.S.
[00:17:13.553 --> 00:17:15.014]  MKUltra program.
[00:17:15.074 --> 00:17:18.455]  He was actually an American living in Canada.
[00:17:20.455 --> 00:17:21.236]  Take notes, folks.
[00:17:21.256 --> 00:17:21.776]  Go look it up.
[00:17:21.856 --> 00:17:27.237]  Dr. Ewing Cameron headed up a giant facility in Canada.
[00:17:27.778 --> 00:17:28.998]  Was it outside Toronto?
[00:17:30.518 --> 00:17:31.558]  We're good to go.
[00:17:51.454 --> 00:17:55.156]  To break them, that they could actually function better under mind control.
[00:17:55.756 --> 00:18:03.859]  Males can be broken as easily, but tend to degrade in their programming and have psychotic breaks and then go into catatonic states.
[00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:12.823]  Or their programming seems to activate incidentally off of triggers and they're more volatile.
[00:18:14.504 --> 00:18:19.746]  Just like males of the mammal, mammalian family, all are generally more volatile.
[00:18:22.087 --> 00:18:22.947]  We're built that way.
[00:18:23.948 --> 00:18:34.853]  But to make a long story short, studying mind control, we learned how Ewing Cameron would do it, and he got a lot of his cues from the Nazis and the Russians.
[00:18:37.154 --> 00:18:41.477]  And it works better with a young subject, generally under the age of 10, but they can do it with somebody who's 20.
[00:18:42.497 --> 00:18:47.540]  And you take them, and you give them cocktails of PCP, LSD,
[00:18:49.169 --> 00:19:01.801]  A psilocybin mushrooms, peyote, I guess the ground up derivation would be psilocybin, or excuse me, it's the mescaline.
[00:19:02.922 --> 00:19:04.543]  That's the Spanish term for it.
[00:19:05.884 --> 00:19:11.209]  And they would create these cocktails and give it to you large doses every day.
[00:19:11.870 --> 00:19:15.013]  They would put headphones on you strapped down for munch.
[00:19:16.439 --> 00:19:21.461]  Where you were in an unconscious state, feeding you intravenously.
[00:19:21.481 --> 00:19:23.622]  They'd have to feed you and beef you up later.
[00:19:23.642 --> 00:19:25.983]  That's why all these micro people are very skinny and very white.
[00:19:26.464 --> 00:19:27.004]  Very pale.
[00:19:28.584 --> 00:19:30.805]  Or they're black and they almost have a green skin tone.
[00:19:30.845 --> 00:19:31.526]  Very unhealthy.
[00:19:32.726 --> 00:19:40.109]  And they then pump you with the drugs and with the audio feeding in with a cover over your eyes.
[00:19:40.129 --> 00:19:41.850]  Kind of like you see the Guantanamo detainees.
[00:19:42.791 --> 00:19:42.911]  That...
[00:19:44.452 --> 00:19:53.102]  Deprivation of outside sensual stimuli, they then program you with keywords.
[00:19:54.523 --> 00:19:58.087]  Then after they've done that and broken you down, well, we'll tell you what they do after that.
[00:19:58.107 --> 00:20:01.150]  There's different schools of it, different mixtures of schools.
[00:20:02.011 --> 00:20:04.234]  And, oh, it works quite nicely.
[00:20:07.071 --> 00:20:09.572]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network.
[00:20:09.672 --> 00:20:12.053]  I have an urgent message for all of our listeners.
[00:20:12.113 --> 00:20:19.237]  The mass media keeps telling us that we are the richest, most powerful economy in the world, quote-unquote.
[00:20:19.817 --> 00:20:22.138]  If this is true, why can't we pay our bills?
[00:20:22.798 --> 00:20:26.360]  Why is the United States the world's largest debtor nation?
[00:20:26.900 --> 00:20:31.042]  The truth is that we are in the worst debt bubble in our nation's history.
[00:20:31.623 --> 00:20:34.584]  When the bubble bursts, will you be able to feed your family?
[00:20:35.586 --> 00:20:38.527]  When the inevitable crash occurs, will you be ready?
[00:20:39.267 --> 00:20:45.289]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.
[00:20:45.529 --> 00:20:49.111]  That's 1-888-892-6238.
[00:20:49.871 --> 00:20:53.232]  For the following two free reports, U.S.
[00:20:53.312 --> 00:20:56.233]  Debt Bubble, Red Alert, and Real Estate Crash.
[00:20:57.213 --> 00:20:59.514]  Call 888-8XANADU.
[00:20:59.574 --> 00:21:03.775]  That's 888-8XANADU.
[00:21:04.116 --> 00:21:05.076]  And ask for George.
[00:21:06.460 --> 00:21:07.681]  Ted Anderson from Midas.
[00:21:07.721 --> 00:21:08.621]  Today is October 3rd, 2006.
[00:21:08.661 --> 00:21:10.783]  Gold opened at 587 and 1 ounce gold coins can be purchased for 619.
[00:21:10.823 --> 00:21:12.904]  Again, that's 619 to purchase 1 ounce gold coins.
[00:21:18.402 --> 00:21:21.104]  Do you ever wonder why deficit spending never goes away?
[00:21:21.564 --> 00:21:26.227]  Would you believe me if I told you that fiscal responsibility would lead to a second Great Depression?
[00:21:26.627 --> 00:21:28.048]  Believe it or not, this is true.
[00:21:28.488 --> 00:21:31.650]  Our economy gets its currency from a private banking cartel.
[00:21:32.030 --> 00:21:37.513]  We, the people, labor to create the money, only to turn it over to this institution for its seal of approval.
[00:21:37.914 --> 00:21:43.597]  They, in turn, lend it back to us, and we, the people, are forced to labor to service the interest on this debt.
[00:21:44.017 --> 00:21:48.941]  Midas Resources is offering The Creature from Jekyll Island, a second look at the Federal Reserve.
[00:21:49.341 --> 00:21:49.621]  Call 800-686-2237.

[00:21:51.283 --> 00:21:51.323]  800-686-2237.
[00:21:51.343 --> 00:21:53.484]  If you have, pick up a copy for your friend or relative.
[00:21:53.564 --> 00:21:53.885]  Call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:07.699 --> 00:22:08.059]  We're good to go.
[00:22:33.699 --> 00:22:34.199]  We listened.
[00:22:34.540 --> 00:22:39.963]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[00:22:40.383 --> 00:22:41.804]  Again, we listened.
[00:22:42.184 --> 00:22:49.028]  Introducing the Berkey Light, the gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.
[00:22:50.229 --> 00:22:52.951]  Get the Berkey Light, the American water purifier.
[00:22:53.171 --> 00:22:53.372]  Only $279.
[00:22:53.432 --> 00:22:54.032]  Call new Millennium 888-803-4438.
[00:22:54.072 --> 00:22:54.332]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:22:54.392 --> 00:22:55.773]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[00:22:55.793 --> 00:22:56.574]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:23:06.221 --> 00:23:14.187]  For years, you've been hearing about Herbal Healer Academy and how it's remained the leader in effective alternative and natural medicine and education.
[00:23:14.647 --> 00:23:17.849]  But how can they continue to hold that title for years on end?
[00:23:18.209 --> 00:23:21.271]  The answer is high quality and huge selection.

[00:24:01.574 --> 00:24:04.976]  HerbalHealer.com Working with the power of nature.
[00:24:08.195 --> 00:24:13.759]  So right now I'm getting into mind control.
[00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:22.865]  Keywords, Dr. Ewing Cameron, MKUltra, MKNaomi, can get pretty well educated off official U.S.
[00:24:22.885 --> 00:24:26.447]  government documents and mainstream news just by typing those keywords in.
[00:24:27.628 --> 00:24:34.373]  So our government would, they wouldn't carry out 9-11, but they admit they kidnapped several thousand small children.
[00:24:35.688 --> 00:24:36.389]  Boys and girls.
[00:24:36.429 --> 00:24:39.791]  They also kidnapped quite a few adults.
[00:24:40.651 --> 00:24:42.652]  Again, this has even been on History Channel.
[00:24:43.252 --> 00:24:47.835]  They wouldn't stage terror attacks and kill 2,800 plus people.
[00:24:48.135 --> 00:24:48.775]  Oh, no.
[00:24:49.536 --> 00:24:56.480]  But they would radiate, pay Israel to radiate 110,000 Jewish children in the Ringworm Children Studies.
[00:25:00.325 --> 00:25:03.927]  It's called Ringworm Children because they would tell them, we're going to test you for fungus.
[00:25:04.387 --> 00:25:06.968]  They'd radiate them, for those that just joined us.
[00:25:07.789 --> 00:25:12.671]  And then they'd let the black men die of syphilis and spread it for 45 years and then give them syphilis in some cases.
[00:25:13.052 --> 00:25:13.712]  They'd sterilize 400,000.
[00:25:14.112 --> 00:25:19.975]  They'd do all this here in our country and protect the Nazis, but they wouldn't carry out 9-11.
[00:25:20.015 --> 00:25:20.655]  That's right.
[00:25:21.116 --> 00:25:22.416]  But anyways, back to the mind control.
[00:25:24.778 --> 00:25:27.259]  And then in other cases...
[00:25:28.460 --> 00:25:31.202]  And there were different, again, mixtures of the different types of training.
[00:25:31.262 --> 00:25:56.200]  After they'd gotten somebody and they had programmed them with keywords and fed them for sometimes six months drugs and pumped in all of this bizarre audio with different programs, they would then, in some cases, give them electroshock, insulin shock, and in some of the cases, they would do stuff like
[00:25:57.211 --> 00:26:06.255]  Then after you'd been drugged out for six months, they would put you into a weird chamber with bizarre painted walls.
[00:26:07.116 --> 00:26:10.837]  And then as soon as you came off the drugs, all of a sudden the door would just open.
[00:26:11.197 --> 00:26:12.918]  You don't know where you've been for six months.
[00:26:12.958 --> 00:26:13.959]  You're nine years old.
[00:26:14.299 --> 00:26:16.880]  People would come walking in dressed up like space aliens.
[00:26:17.449 --> 00:26:19.111]  And start shocking you with cattle prods.
[00:26:19.151 --> 00:26:22.714]  Or sometimes they'd have on devil outfits, really scary outfits with horns.
[00:26:24.615 --> 00:26:25.856]  Run around you, freaking you out.
[00:26:25.876 --> 00:26:28.919]  Then they'd hit you with a type of hallucinogenic gas.
[00:26:28.959 --> 00:26:33.623]  And again, that was to shock you and put these children just in a total fear.
[00:26:34.144 --> 00:26:39.248]  And then sexual torture was a big part of it, really because the perverts that run the government like sexual torture.
[00:26:39.929 --> 00:26:43.412]  And what you see now with the memos and all the public discussion of it,
[00:26:43.952 --> 00:27:00.899]  And then they would sexually torture them and brutalize them and then six months more programming until the point of when you hear a keyword, basically they would apply or remove pressure with different keywords.
[00:27:01.659 --> 00:27:07.261]  And so basically in the final stages, this is what you do when you hear this set of words.
[00:27:07.301 --> 00:27:10.462]  It's not really a keyword because people might hear that keyword on accident.
[00:27:10.482 --> 00:27:11.523]  It's a string of words.
[00:27:12.666 --> 00:27:12.826]  Okay.
[00:27:12.846 --> 00:27:13.046]  Okay.
[00:27:41.517 --> 00:27:50.680]  And in the last week, two separate cases of them going and tying up girls and rape and shooting and all of it.
[00:27:51.981 --> 00:27:55.062]  And again, the programming is what the masters are into.
[00:27:55.262 --> 00:27:58.283]  You notice that, well, Gonzalez's memos are about torturing kids.
[00:27:58.343 --> 00:28:01.104]  John Hughes, the White House, is openly saying this.
[00:28:01.164 --> 00:28:03.125]  Well, why does this just keep coming up?
[00:28:03.525 --> 00:28:05.126]  This is their religion.
[00:28:05.866 --> 00:28:07.207]  What was ancient occultic...
[00:28:09.231 --> 00:28:10.632]  rituals and ceremonies about.
[00:28:10.652 --> 00:28:22.319]  The tribe would get together and take a bunch of drugs, and if you had a really dark witch doctor, he would demand one of your firstborn as a way of traumatizing you, a way of training you to do whatever he said.
[00:28:22.339 --> 00:28:23.900]  That's where human sacrifice began.
[00:28:24.220 --> 00:28:30.083]  And then, of course, the witch doctors had the forbidden knowledge, and so they could manipulate the tribe.
[00:28:30.323 --> 00:28:31.704]  Well, that's what the elite is today.
[00:28:31.724 --> 00:28:35.106]  That's their symbol, is the pyramid, the elite, the all-seeing eye.
[00:28:35.166 --> 00:28:38.068]  They know they're in the light, we're in the dark.
[00:28:38.601 --> 00:28:39.061]  We're good to go.
[00:29:07.959 --> 00:29:11.296]  I remember him saying that they use Amish...
[00:29:13.715 --> 00:29:19.000]  And that they used the Amish, and he mentioned, of course, the East.
[00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:23.363]  He mentioned Ohio and Pennsylvania and Illinois.
[00:29:23.383 --> 00:29:25.985]  And he'd lived with the Amish for, what, three years?
[00:29:26.226 --> 00:29:29.909]  Because he was pretty much a kind of Amish-type guy himself.
[00:29:29.949 --> 00:29:31.210]  He wanted to get back to the land.
[00:29:31.850 --> 00:29:38.376]  And he discovered, this is how he even discovered mind control, was because the Amish community he was living in had U.S.
[00:29:38.736 --> 00:29:39.937]  government operatives on it,
[00:29:40.735 --> 00:29:45.536]  And they recruit out of the Amish for high-level mind-control programs.
[00:29:45.996 --> 00:29:47.117]  And we're on record saying that.
[00:29:47.377 --> 00:29:51.698]  His films and books, his book Bloodlines Illuminati is on record saying that.
[00:29:51.718 --> 00:29:56.299]  And where do you see this happening but in an Amish community, in an Amish area?
[00:29:56.759 --> 00:29:57.639]  We'll be right back.
[00:30:00.260 --> 00:30:01.180]  We're on the march.
[00:30:01.661 --> 00:30:03.281]  The empire's on the run.
[00:30:04.201 --> 00:30:06.882]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:09.773 --> 00:30:12.415]  Is your child disrespectful, defiant, or obnoxious?
[00:30:12.755 --> 00:30:14.956]  Does everything turn into an argument with your kid?
[00:30:15.276 --> 00:30:16.977]  I'm behavioral therapist James Lehman.

[00:30:27.183 --> 00:30:29.084]  Now when I ask him to do something, he does it.
[00:30:29.484 --> 00:30:34.607]  We've learned verbiage from the Total Transformation program, and it's almost like magic.
[00:30:34.947 --> 00:30:37.428]  If you say those words, they stop arguing.
[00:30:37.488 --> 00:30:42.791]  Defiance, backtalking, lying, acting out in school, even problems with ADD and ADHD.
[00:30:43.011 --> 00:30:46.513]  The Total Transformation will help you solve even the worst behavior problems.

[00:31:31.080 --> 00:31:36.544]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum are no problem.
[00:31:36.564 --> 00:31:37.565]  We're good to go.

[00:32:09.699 --> 00:32:12.200]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network.
[00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:14.681]  I have an urgent message for all of our listeners.
[00:32:14.761 --> 00:32:21.842]  The mass media keeps telling us that we are the richest, most powerful economy in the world, quote-unquote.
[00:32:22.442 --> 00:32:24.643]  If this is true, why can't we pay our bills?
[00:32:25.422 --> 00:32:28.964]  Why is the United States the world's largest debtor nation?
[00:32:29.525 --> 00:32:33.667]  The truth is that we are in the worst debt bubble in our nation's history.
[00:32:34.248 --> 00:32:37.250]  When the bubble bursts, will you be able to feed your family?
[00:32:38.230 --> 00:32:41.152]  When the inevitable crash occurs, will you be ready?
[00:32:41.893 --> 00:32:43.994]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.
[00:32:44.014 --> 00:32:46.356]  That's 1-888-892-6238 for the following two free reports.
[00:32:55.567 --> 00:32:55.867]  U.S.
[00:32:55.947 --> 00:32:58.849]  debt bubble, red alert, and real estate crash.
[00:32:59.829 --> 00:33:07.753]  Call 888-8XANADU, that's 888-8XANADU, and ask for George.
[00:33:12.276 --> 00:33:17.438]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:18.118 --> 00:33:20.440]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:33:36.404 --> 00:33:55.661]  So this guy goes into an Amish schoolhouse, has the boys go outside, he hog ties with the police plastic handcuffs, the little girls, and shoots six of them, five of them are dead, shoots himself.
[00:33:57.102 --> 00:34:00.465]  And then less than a week ago, a sicko goes in,
[00:34:01.605 --> 00:34:05.768]  And ties up a bunch of little girls and starts sexually assaulting them.
[00:34:08.090 --> 00:34:09.211]  But hey, don't worry.
[00:34:09.571 --> 00:34:11.893]  The feds are going to save you.
[00:34:13.875 --> 00:34:16.877]  This does fit classic mind control MO.
[00:34:19.899 --> 00:34:23.602]  There was an idiot that called in yesterday at the very end of the broadcast.
[00:34:23.642 --> 00:34:25.524]  He said he was going to call in today.
[00:34:26.885 --> 00:34:28.386]  And he's welcome to call in.
[00:34:30.137 --> 00:34:31.398]  If he'd like to again.
[00:34:31.418 --> 00:34:32.739]  I forgot his first name.
[00:34:33.760 --> 00:34:36.141]  But the show had ended and he was still talking.
[00:34:36.181 --> 00:34:36.962]  I said, I gotta go.
[00:34:37.002 --> 00:34:37.742]  Thank you for the call.
[00:34:37.802 --> 00:34:40.484]  And they faded him down and were listening to him in cue.
[00:34:41.905 --> 00:34:47.729]  And John, who was running the show, told me that he was going, and it's a conspiracy theory about skull and bones.
[00:34:47.809 --> 00:34:48.729]  It doesn't exist.
[00:34:48.769 --> 00:34:55.554]  And you're a nut and you're a liar and you're a... And he was busy telling me that the police didn't shoot anybody at Columbine when it's admitted.
[00:34:56.289 --> 00:35:06.932]  And he was busy just basically saying, how dare I call him Kleibold when it was Kleibold, and I'm just basically a fraud.
[00:35:10.273 --> 00:35:16.475]  When many of the children said they saw four men in black masks shooting people, there were 128 bombs removed from Columbine.
[00:35:21.400 --> 00:35:22.141]  We're good to go.
[00:35:51.122 --> 00:35:57.186]  128 bombs in the building.
[00:35:57.267 --> 00:35:57.927]  128 bombs.
[00:35:57.967 --> 00:35:58.407]  Go look it up.
[00:35:58.427 --> 00:35:59.088]  CBS News.
[00:36:00.689 --> 00:36:04.011]  The SWAT team stayed outside for 4 hours and 15 minutes.
[00:36:04.031 --> 00:36:07.333]  I remember I had the editor of the Rocky Mountain News on, and I said, over 3 hours.
[00:36:07.373 --> 00:36:08.154]  He said, over 3.
[00:36:08.194 --> 00:36:10.516]  It was 4 hours and 15 minutes.
[00:36:11.316 --> 00:36:12.297]  We had reporters there.
[00:36:13.524 --> 00:36:17.847]  That they stood outside under orders of that very suspicious sheriff.
[00:36:18.427 --> 00:36:25.651]  You have Harris and Klebold, who had run the school's internet.
[00:36:26.792 --> 00:36:30.894]  They had done a play and videotaped it where they shot the students.
[00:36:31.634 --> 00:36:33.255]  They were pets of the principal.
[00:36:33.896 --> 00:36:36.197]  Both their parents had worked in secret U.S.
[00:36:36.317 --> 00:36:37.538]  government programs.
[00:36:38.610 --> 00:36:46.736]  The founder of the Trenchcoat Mafia was the son of a prominent FBI agent, and that caller just said, Uh-huh, what's your proof of that?
[00:36:46.756 --> 00:36:49.918]  Uh-huh, sure, sure, sure, I bet that's true.
[00:36:50.118 --> 00:36:52.060]  Uh-huh, yeah, yeah, you're lying.
[00:36:52.320 --> 00:36:53.360]  It's all over the news.
[00:36:54.761 --> 00:36:56.683]  Just type it into Google, you'll get the news articles.
[00:36:57.123 --> 00:37:02.847]  Again, it's like a caller I had Sunday on my Sunday show saying, There's no Operation Northwoods.
[00:37:03.227 --> 00:37:03.748]  I'm a liar.
[00:37:03.768 --> 00:37:05.209]  It just doesn't exist.
[00:37:06.490 --> 00:37:08.111]  The sun doesn't come up in the morning either.
[00:37:11.132 --> 00:37:18.197]  But I remember multiple mind control experts, not the coach, people that really had done their research, like Fritz Springmeier, who had lived with the Amish.
[00:37:18.217 --> 00:37:19.638]  This is how he found out about mind control.
[00:37:20.318 --> 00:37:21.679]  Well, he said like 20 years ago.
[00:37:22.580 --> 00:37:25.182]  He was just a Christian conservative and wanted to go work and live.
[00:37:25.202 --> 00:37:26.283]  He tried to join the Amish.
[00:37:26.323 --> 00:37:26.703]  He did.
[00:37:29.025 --> 00:37:33.688]  Fritz, big old 6'5 guy with a big beard, straight edge.
[00:37:34.691 --> 00:37:36.693]  And he went there and he got out of it.
[00:37:36.713 --> 00:37:39.174]  He said there was some type of government program going on.
[00:37:39.194 --> 00:37:41.256]  I ought to get Fritz's wife on to tell us about that.
[00:37:41.316 --> 00:37:43.758]  I ought to go dig all the passages up in his books.
[00:37:43.778 --> 00:37:45.359]  I ought to go find his speeches he's given.
[00:37:45.679 --> 00:37:46.820]  We could play some of those here.
[00:37:46.840 --> 00:37:53.305]  And I find it just peculiar that it's... Now, the police are calling it a copycat.
[00:37:53.805 --> 00:38:00.110]  And there's probably a 10% chance that this is a real sicko who went in to the school last week and tied up the girls and did this.
[00:38:02.652 --> 00:38:03.413]  And there's a 10% chance that
[00:38:04.560 --> 00:38:09.262]  This individual picked up on it and went into the Amish community and did this.
[00:38:09.542 --> 00:38:11.362]  But I just, it doesn't fit.
[00:38:12.423 --> 00:38:13.123]  It doesn't fit.
[00:38:13.183 --> 00:38:22.646]  I mean, in every case we've seen, it may be different than these, but in the past, in every case, they're under some weird former government psychiatrist-controlled care, as they call it.
[00:38:23.727 --> 00:38:32.290]  They have been on some weird military base facility in some secret program like Buford Furrow, who shot up the Jewish Center in L.A.
[00:38:32.330 --> 00:38:32.770]  Remember that?
[00:38:34.250 --> 00:38:34.871]  It's always the same.
[00:38:55.572 --> 00:38:58.293]  I mean, we know Timothy McVeigh was mind-controlled.
[00:38:58.333 --> 00:39:00.654]  We know he made it into Special Forces.
[00:39:00.694 --> 00:39:02.715]  We know he disappeared into a secret program.
[00:39:03.135 --> 00:39:17.742]  We know that Jolly and West, the number two in MKUltra, one of the associates of Dr. Ewing Cameron, this is mainstream information, went and was by McVeigh's side in Denver for the entire trial.
[00:39:19.122 --> 00:39:23.324]  We know he was there with him every week at Terre Haute, Indiana.
[00:39:24.711 --> 00:39:33.677]  At the execution center, right up until the day he died, and then shortly after Mr. West died, after his long career, Jolly and West.
[00:39:35.298 --> 00:39:36.359]  I mean, just go look that up.
[00:39:40.542 --> 00:39:52.169]  McVeigh was found by state police, driving erratically, running on and off the side of the road, in a huge, white, 30-something-year-old bus,
[00:39:53.883 --> 00:40:01.608]  Big bomber, with no license plates, with his gun on the dash, and he walks up and McVeigh falls to his knees.
[00:40:01.628 --> 00:40:09.553]  This is what state police told the Oklahoma and other papers, and says, please make it stop, get the chip out of me, with spit coming out of his mouth.
[00:40:12.274 --> 00:40:21.180]  Number one, demolition experts have reported that there's no way you could fuel that truck 100 miles away and drive it and get it there and have it not blow up on you.
[00:40:21.616 --> 00:40:23.677]  And, of course, it couldn't cause the damage to the building.
[00:40:23.717 --> 00:40:30.941]  And the police reported BATF 30 seconds after in full bomb gear running around and telling doctors, patch them up and claim they were in the rubble.
[00:40:30.981 --> 00:40:35.544]  And then FBI seeing the footage of McVeigh with Arabs.
[00:40:36.084 --> 00:40:37.164]  And those Arabs were under U.S.
[00:40:37.204 --> 00:40:37.985]  government employ.
[00:40:38.025 --> 00:40:39.186]  It's the same story every time.
[00:40:40.206 --> 00:40:43.768]  But all that aside, McVeigh probably didn't have a chip.
[00:40:44.388 --> 00:40:45.089]  It's the trigger.
[00:40:45.389 --> 00:40:46.630]  We've got a chip in you.
[00:40:46.690 --> 00:40:47.830]  That's what causes the pain.
[00:40:47.870 --> 00:40:49.271]  But it's the, you know, they tell them that.
[00:40:51.036 --> 00:41:05.603]  It's what they latch on to, but really it's just the key word makes them go into, and he had a cell phone by the way, makes them go into all of the past trauma and torture they've been through and makes them, I mean, this is how it works.
[00:41:05.623 --> 00:41:12.846]  When you think about your dead wife or dead husband or dead son or daughter, you know, you get nauseous, you get sad, even what, ten years after?
[00:41:13.827 --> 00:41:15.127]  That's normal conditioning.
[00:41:15.347 --> 00:41:16.408]  That's a normal trauma.
[00:41:17.228 --> 00:41:19.029]  Or let's say your father beats you.
[00:41:19.691 --> 00:41:21.992]  He had a way of jumping up out of a chair and backhanding you.
[00:41:22.452 --> 00:41:27.794]  So, I've seen people, you can tell people who've been beaten and abused, because you'll make a sudden movement or get up and they'll flinch.
[00:41:29.614 --> 00:41:31.955]  You know, you get a dog who's been abused, it'll flinch.
[00:41:31.995 --> 00:41:33.636]  See, that's programming, folks.
[00:41:34.376 --> 00:41:36.817]  That's just what a couple of events will do to somebody.
[00:41:37.297 --> 00:41:45.500]  You get somebody down in a subterranean torture facility, and now they've got virtual reality goggles, and the demons are ripping their guts out while they're on LSD, and
[00:41:46.835 --> 00:41:50.659]  But then, oh, they give them a drug that makes all the pain go away and makes them happy and feel good.
[00:41:50.699 --> 00:41:59.348]  As long as you carry out the operation, as long as you love the children, you love them with the gun, fire at the head.
[00:41:59.368 --> 00:42:01.630]  And then seeing the programming, it's even loving.
[00:42:01.970 --> 00:42:02.551]  Love them.
[00:42:02.611 --> 00:42:03.432]  Give them love.
[00:42:04.111 --> 00:42:05.291]  Love them with the gun.
[00:42:05.472 --> 00:42:15.955]  You see, and right at the point when that virtual reality comes in, now in the latest types of programming, with the goggles on and the headset, you see, it's not even that you're hurting them.
[00:42:15.975 --> 00:42:17.136]  You're loving the children.
[00:42:17.656 --> 00:42:21.337]  You go into the school and you begin to free them.
[00:42:21.837 --> 00:42:22.958]  Fire at the head.
[00:42:24.178 --> 00:42:25.919]  And then love yourself.
[00:42:26.039 --> 00:42:26.879]  Free yourself.
[00:42:27.512 --> 00:42:28.793]  Put the gun here.
[00:42:29.173 --> 00:42:29.794]  Over and over again.
[00:42:29.854 --> 00:42:30.734]  Thousands of times.
[00:42:30.774 --> 00:42:31.555]  Put the gun here.
[00:42:31.835 --> 00:42:35.177]  And then all the pain goes away or the monsters come back.
[00:42:35.558 --> 00:42:41.342]  You see, we know this from the torture programming with thousands of U.S.
[00:42:41.382 --> 00:42:49.347]  and Canadian children declassified Ewing Cameron with primitive technologies in the 1960s when it started in 1962.
[00:42:49.668 --> 00:42:54.871]  You see, this big facility he was given and it ran through the late 70s and then he got caught.
[00:42:54.891 --> 00:42:56.853]  It came out in the press.
[00:42:59.346 --> 00:43:03.809]  And he was found civilly guilty of all of this, but the CIA then gave him immunity and paid it off.
[00:43:04.470 --> 00:43:07.252]  Thousands of children kidnapped.
[00:43:07.612 --> 00:43:10.174]  So do you understand how the programming works?
[00:43:10.655 --> 00:43:12.516]  That's how it works.
[00:43:12.756 --> 00:43:14.317]  We know they did this to thousands.
[00:43:14.558 --> 00:43:16.319]  We know McVeigh was mind-controlled.
[00:43:19.406 --> 00:43:22.508]  There's a lot of evidence the hijackers weren't just U.S.
[00:43:22.528 --> 00:43:26.811]  government agents and involved in drills, but there was some type of overlaid conditioning.
[00:43:27.191 --> 00:43:32.655]  The government's openly saying they may start, quote, conditioning and programming special forces troops.
[00:43:33.275 --> 00:43:35.757]  That was in Wired Magazine four years ago.
[00:43:35.797 --> 00:43:37.198]  It was called the Marshall Plan.
[00:43:37.798 --> 00:43:40.940]  And it said in the future it won't be the weapons armies are on, but the drugs.
[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:45.683]  And we're going to condition our troops with aggression drugs and give them amnesia drugs.
[00:43:45.743 --> 00:43:46.504]  Let's mind control.
[00:43:47.885 --> 00:43:50.547]  Put them through virtual reality on the aggression drugs.
[00:43:52.429 --> 00:43:56.592]  Hop them up on boost drugs, adrenal drugs, adrenal hormones.
[00:43:58.994 --> 00:44:02.957]  So see, mind control is going to be mainstream.
[00:44:03.918 --> 00:44:05.499]  Remember after the tour, four...
[00:44:07.723 --> 00:44:09.985]  Members of one squadron.
[00:44:10.025 --> 00:44:11.706]  They call them squadrons for some reason.
[00:44:11.966 --> 00:44:13.447]  That's a small group of men.
[00:44:13.807 --> 00:44:14.467]  Delta Force.
[00:44:14.587 --> 00:44:15.848]  Four men come home.
[00:44:16.208 --> 00:44:17.949]  Three of them kill their wives and children.
[00:44:18.049 --> 00:44:18.790]  One of them tries.
[00:44:19.736 --> 00:44:29.403]  And when the police would pull up, this was in the North Carolina News, the police would pull up and they'd be out on their knees in every case, going, no, make it stop!
[00:44:30.083 --> 00:44:36.287]  I imagine Delta Force out in the front lawns after killing their families going, make it stop, it's in my head!
[00:44:36.587 --> 00:44:40.630]  No, no, make it stop!
[00:44:40.830 --> 00:44:43.372]  There, go ahead, go join Delta Force, enjoy yourselves.
[00:44:44.400 --> 00:44:50.205]  Because they'll tell you you're the most elite, and you're the best, and oh, you've gone through all these hoops, and the government loves you.
[00:44:50.365 --> 00:44:52.046]  The government hates your guts.
[00:44:52.166 --> 00:45:02.495]  They're a bunch of degenerate, pencil-necked pedophiles with high-tech scientists and huge computer-mapped war game programs mapping our behavior, manipulating us scientifically.
[00:45:04.897 --> 00:45:05.758]  They go look it up.
[00:45:06.538 --> 00:45:09.561]  The police would pull up, and these Delta Force guys weren't fighting them.
[00:45:09.741 --> 00:45:12.243]  They were flopping around, screaming, Rah!
[00:45:13.690 --> 00:45:15.692]  On there, out front their houses.
[00:45:15.772 --> 00:45:17.233]  Folks, that's mind control.
[00:45:21.056 --> 00:45:22.538]  And then they tried to spin it.
[00:45:23.458 --> 00:45:30.925]  Then they tried to claim that Delta Force, oh, it was a new...
[00:45:32.407 --> 00:45:35.009]  Malaria drug that causes this.
[00:45:35.169 --> 00:45:38.893]  And no, the malaria drug in very rare cases.
[00:45:38.973 --> 00:45:44.557]  I went and actually read the medical handout on the actual adverse reactions.
[00:45:44.718 --> 00:45:46.279]  You can go pull them up online.
[00:45:47.145 --> 00:45:52.789]  From the drug manufacturer, in a very small percentage of people, it does cause aggression.
[00:45:53.309 --> 00:46:12.041]  Not highly trained Delta Force, the best of the SEALs, the best of the Marine Force Recon, the best of the Green Berets, the cream de la creme, my friends, literally, totally snapping and killing their families.
[00:46:13.963 --> 00:46:15.224]  And then burning their houses down.
[00:46:15.244 --> 00:46:15.884]  I forgot that part.
[00:46:16.661 --> 00:46:17.902]  That was total programming.
[00:46:18.523 --> 00:46:22.086]  And they admit they've done all sorts of weird mind control experiments going back to the 60s.
[00:46:22.807 --> 00:46:27.932]  We even interviewed the head of the program, Stubblebine, but he wasn't involved in stuff.
[00:46:28.173 --> 00:46:29.894]  At least he wouldn't tell us at that level.
[00:46:30.195 --> 00:46:32.717]  But it was all sorts of weird mind control testing.
[00:46:35.660 --> 00:46:37.582]  So this is what's going on.
[00:46:38.777 --> 00:46:40.518]  And then there's lower grades of mind control.
[00:46:40.558 --> 00:46:41.699]  Cultural conditioning.
[00:46:42.040 --> 00:46:43.781]  Peer pressure is a form of mind control.
[00:46:43.921 --> 00:46:46.423]  It's very strong, but primitive and natural.
[00:46:46.443 --> 00:46:50.807]  And they use all that at different layers through the TV, through the cultural conditioning.
[00:46:50.867 --> 00:46:53.549]  Oh, look, the sexy, smart lady on TV.
[00:46:53.989 --> 00:46:55.931]  She likes world government.
[00:46:55.971 --> 00:46:58.052]  Or, you know, Miss America wants world government.
[00:46:58.072 --> 00:46:58.913]  Everyone, what do you want?
[00:46:59.073 --> 00:47:01.595]  I want global peace and a powerful UN.
[00:47:02.996 --> 00:47:06.159]  Again, that's just social conditioning, class, status.
[00:47:08.352 --> 00:47:09.252]  That's advertising.
[00:47:09.292 --> 00:47:14.517]  Madison Avenue, oh, you'll be beautiful and stylish and cool if you have this $100,000 Mercedes.
[00:47:14.997 --> 00:47:16.839]  You've got to have it or you're not adequate.
[00:47:18.880 --> 00:47:30.170]  See, there's all those low-level programming propaganda, but then there's the wires hooked into the head, the virtual reality, the drugs, the torture, and you get exactly what you want with that.
[00:47:32.464 --> 00:47:35.825]  And I'm about 90% sure that's exactly what's going on.
[00:47:35.865 --> 00:47:37.126]  They snap their fingers.
[00:47:37.526 --> 00:47:42.567]  And last night I was saying to myself, I was saying that Bush comes out with an initiative for federal control of schools.
[00:47:43.588 --> 00:47:45.408]  We had dinner last night in between TV shows.
[00:47:47.109 --> 00:47:57.572]  And I told, I was there with the crew, we were eating at the El Azteca Mexican restaurant, all their Aztec worship stuff, side issue, on the walls.
[00:47:58.363 --> 00:48:09.907]  And I'm in there, and I said, this is a government op if Bush proposes tomorrow a federal initiative to further federalize the schools.
[00:48:11.127 --> 00:48:11.928]  You'll be able to tell.
[00:48:12.248 --> 00:48:14.149]  It already looks like a government op, but I said, I'm not sure.
[00:48:14.729 --> 00:48:20.551]  But you'll know it's a government op if they respond immediately with an already codified plan.
[00:48:21.611 --> 00:48:24.032]  Well, guess what was released at 7.52 a.m.
[00:48:24.072 --> 00:48:24.752]  Eastern Time today?
[00:48:32.373 --> 00:48:35.076]  Bush Organizing School Violence Summit.
[00:48:36.097 --> 00:48:49.829]  The Bush administration, alarmed by recent attacks at public schools across the country, is bringing education and law enforcement experts together for a conference on coming to grips with the problems that are shifting out of terror for a while.
[00:48:49.909 --> 00:48:53.853]  The goal would be to discuss the nature and the problem of federal action...
[00:48:54.560 --> 00:48:57.982]  That can help communities prevent violence and deal with its aftermath.
[00:48:58.202 --> 00:48:59.623]  Because Homeland Security's got to do something.
[00:48:59.643 --> 00:49:02.444]  There's not any real terror threat, so they're going to quote, fight crime.
[00:49:03.685 --> 00:49:10.048]  And they've openly said in federal documents, the schools are mind control facilities, conditioning facilities, locked down, being searched.
[00:49:10.328 --> 00:49:10.848]  They're prisons.
[00:49:10.868 --> 00:49:12.789]  They follow prisons.
[00:49:12.869 --> 00:49:17.312]  Prison... operating procedures.
[00:49:18.752 --> 00:49:19.233]  Procedures.
[00:49:19.853 --> 00:49:21.674]  White House spokeswoman...
[00:49:22.581 --> 00:49:28.448]  Dana Perino told reporters as President Bush made a campaign tour here Monday.
[00:49:30.430 --> 00:49:31.191]  And it goes on.
[00:49:31.271 --> 00:49:34.335]  Three schools have been hit by deadly attacks in the past week.
[00:49:34.375 --> 00:49:34.896]  A gunman...
[00:49:35.698 --> 00:49:38.159]  And there's a major mind control program in Colorado.
[00:49:38.179 --> 00:49:39.420]  That's why you keep seeing that there.
[00:49:39.440 --> 00:49:40.861]  The president is deeply saddened.
[00:49:40.901 --> 00:49:41.741]  I bet you are, buddy.
[00:50:02.961 --> 00:50:10.546]  The president is deeply saddened and troubled by the recent school violence and shootings that have taken place in different communities across America.
[00:50:11.006 --> 00:50:22.454]  Perino said it breaks America's collective heart when innocent children who are at school to learn how to be slaves, I would add, are violently taken hostage and cut down in their own schools.
[00:50:22.734 --> 00:50:24.635]  Perino said the conference
[00:50:25.402 --> 00:50:31.428]  Well, still in the planning stages, so a specific date, location, and other details were not ready to be announced.
[00:50:31.448 --> 00:50:33.390]  It was not clear whether President Bush would attend.
[00:50:33.790 --> 00:50:47.724]  Education Secretary Margaret Spellings, Attorney General Alberto Gonzalez, who says they can torture children in front of their parents, and President Bush's domestic policy advisor, Carl Zinsmeister, met Monday at the White House to discuss the conference.
[00:50:48.244 --> 00:50:55.089]  They met while the president was on a cross-country flight to begin a three-day fundraising trip for Republican candidates in the midterm election.
[00:50:55.490 --> 00:51:03.736]  Perino said participants of the education side would include groups like the National Parent Teacher Association, school principals and teacher unions.
[00:51:03.756 --> 00:51:08.340]  The Federal Bureau of Investigations would be among those representing law enforcement, she said.
[00:51:09.020 --> 00:51:13.924]  And the recommendations will be turning the schools into maximum security prisons.
[00:51:18.274 --> 00:51:21.476]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[00:51:21.816 --> 00:51:23.777]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[00:51:24.137 --> 00:51:31.821]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:32.521 --> 00:51:39.584]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:51:40.005 --> 00:51:42.946]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran.
[00:51:43.346 --> 00:51:45.667]  A White House program to disseminate fake news.
[00:51:46.088 --> 00:51:46.948]  NSA spying.
[00:51:48.109 --> 00:51:51.471]  The latest 9-11 information and much, much more.
[00:51:51.791 --> 00:51:55.292]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:51:55.772 --> 00:51:57.693]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:51:58.033 --> 00:52:01.935]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:52:14.881 --> 00:52:18.022]  These elements also reduce unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[00:52:43.292 --> 00:52:48.295]  Unbelievably, they even remove small micro-particulate from water like food coloring particles.
[00:52:48.495 --> 00:52:51.456]  Yeah, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:52:51.696 --> 00:53:01.541]  Moreover, because they are recleanable, black Berkey elements are more economical than the standard disposable elements, providing fresh, pure water for less than two cents per gallon.

[00:53:34.709 --> 00:53:37.030]  Heated cell pills for earaches and back pain.
[00:53:37.510 --> 00:53:39.491]  Salt pipes to relieve respiratory ailments.
[00:53:39.851 --> 00:53:43.752]  Bath salts release toxins as they soften and rehydrate the skin.
[00:53:44.112 --> 00:53:47.954]  Pretty salt lamps to ionize the air and reduce EMF radiation.
[00:53:48.434 --> 00:53:50.715]  So many different cell products available for you.
[00:53:51.135 --> 00:53:52.697]  It's time to let the secret out.
[00:53:52.937 --> 00:54:03.888]  Visit Soleil Wellness at natural-salt-lamps.com That's natural-salt-lamps.com Or call 312-224-2710 That's 312-224-2710 Mention GCN Live for a free gift.
[00:54:16.690 --> 00:54:20.834]  We don't need no education.
[00:54:21.775 --> 00:54:25.659]  That's a young Native American boy up in Minnesota who shot all those people last year.
[00:54:25.699 --> 00:54:25.979]  Remember?
[00:54:25.999 --> 00:54:30.944]  He'd been under a government psychiatrist's care.
[00:54:30.964 --> 00:54:32.706]  It's the same M.O.
[00:54:32.746 --> 00:54:33.306]  every time.
[00:54:35.989 --> 00:54:40.994]  And some of these are copycats, but some of this is government provocateur actions.
[00:54:42.987 --> 00:54:47.310]  There's no way the police were told to stay back for 4 hours and 15 minutes for no reason.
[00:54:48.150 --> 00:54:53.693]  Columbine, there's no way they got 128 bombs, some of them, again, gigantic tanks under the building.
[00:54:55.974 --> 00:55:01.137]  They have to condition the society, and they had to carry out Columbine as a pretext, not just to get our guns.
[00:55:01.738 --> 00:55:04.539]  More importantly was to fully take over the schools.
[00:55:06.080 --> 00:55:09.302]  What, 85% of the children in America go to public schools.
[00:55:09.322 --> 00:55:11.103]  They're already locking down the private schools.
[00:55:13.118 --> 00:55:13.398]  I mean, folks...
[00:55:43.263 --> 00:55:45.804]  You're asking for it, putting your daughters into public schools.
[00:55:46.364 --> 00:55:50.546]  Your sons will turn into little gang members, because that's what the media tells everybody's cool.
[00:55:53.547 --> 00:55:55.228]  Just come out of Babylon, folks.
[00:55:55.248 --> 00:55:57.109]  There's nothing cool about this system.
[00:55:57.989 --> 00:55:59.189]  There's nothing fun about it.
[00:56:00.590 --> 00:56:03.251]  And you know what they do when there's a shooter inside a school?
[00:56:03.271 --> 00:56:04.251]  They lock all the doors.
[00:56:04.952 --> 00:56:12.815]  There's probably going to be a school shooting where they're going to send in a real mind control assassin, and there'll probably be like 85 dead children, maybe 50 more wounded.
[00:56:14.170 --> 00:56:14.850]  And that's it.
[00:56:14.890 --> 00:56:15.490]  We're sorry.
[00:56:15.510 --> 00:56:16.251]  We didn't want to do it.
[00:56:16.311 --> 00:56:19.232]  But psychological testing for all gun owners.
[00:56:19.272 --> 00:56:21.092]  You come in and do it or we're taking your guns.
[00:56:21.552 --> 00:56:23.213]  And now we've got to register everybody.
[00:56:23.253 --> 00:56:26.654]  And now we've got to... Bush hasn't tripled.
[00:56:26.694 --> 00:56:28.215]  I know I've been saying doubled.
[00:56:28.295 --> 00:56:29.915]  Now he expanded even again.
[00:56:29.995 --> 00:56:32.876]  So it's crippled the funding it was getting in 2010.
[00:56:36.070 --> 00:56:36.270]  Early 2001.
[00:56:37.111 --> 00:56:39.112]  It has tripled the funding now.
[00:56:39.613 --> 00:56:41.854]  The biggest federal building in D.C.
[00:56:41.874 --> 00:56:43.776]  now is the BATF headquarters there.
[00:56:44.196 --> 00:56:45.016]  Almost completed it.
[00:56:45.056 --> 00:56:46.317]  They broke ground four years ago.
[00:56:47.078 --> 00:56:49.380]  A gigantic facility.
[00:56:49.840 --> 00:56:51.181]  Huge underground.
[00:56:51.221 --> 00:56:54.243]  I remember seeing the blueprints, like eight stories underground.
[00:56:54.823 --> 00:56:56.204]  What is it, like 20 stories on top?
[00:56:56.244 --> 00:56:57.445]  It's a big, fat building.
[00:56:57.465 --> 00:56:58.466]  I don't know.
[00:56:58.486 --> 00:56:59.126]  I've got to pull it up.
[00:56:59.167 --> 00:56:59.627]  I don't remember.
[00:56:59.967 --> 00:57:03.730]  I know it's the biggest federal building now in D.C.,
[00:57:05.354 --> 00:57:08.035]  I mean, they got a job, and it's getting your guns.
[00:57:09.236 --> 00:57:10.677]  Because Bush is conservative.
[00:57:13.058 --> 00:57:15.359]  And so this is what we face as a society.
[00:57:15.899 --> 00:57:17.500]  North Korea is threatening to test the new.
[00:57:17.520 --> 00:57:18.300]  It's a huge crisis.
[00:57:18.721 --> 00:57:19.821]  I know we've already got a bunch of callers.
[00:57:19.841 --> 00:57:22.562]  We've got a guest coming on for just 15 minutes.
[00:57:22.823 --> 00:57:26.384]  She's a law professor coming on to talk about secret detainees, secret arrests.
[00:57:26.444 --> 00:57:30.546]  There's been a bunch of new facets to this bill that have been discovered I want to go through.
[00:57:32.087 --> 00:57:33.748]  We'll go to Ken, Jeff, Jim, William.
[00:57:35.160 --> 00:57:50.767]  Chris and many others that are patiently holding, on the last minute of this hour, if you believe in this broadcast and what we're doing and want to support us, but more importantly want to get tools that will educate you and inform others, get my new film Terror Storm, over three hours with the extras, best film I've ever made.
[00:57:51.427 --> 00:57:57.650]  Get 9-11 Mysteries that we're carrying, 9-11 Mysteries that we are carrying right now.
[00:58:00.413 --> 00:58:01.073]  Just came out.
[00:58:01.374 --> 00:58:02.494]  Focusing on the demolitions.
[00:58:02.895 --> 00:58:03.735]  Focusing in on those.
[00:58:03.775 --> 00:58:05.136]  Have your own DVD for your library.
[00:58:05.576 --> 00:58:06.957]  Great way to wake other people up.
[00:58:06.997 --> 00:58:07.718]  Have it as a tool.

[00:59:08.032 --> 00:59:13.015]  Now you can bring Berkey Purification Power anywhere with the Sport Berkey Filtration Bottle.
[00:59:13.315 --> 00:59:18.778]  Ideal for sporting games, camping or boating, or Sport Berkey is small enough to store in your glove box.
[00:59:18.818 --> 00:59:23.140]  So it's ideal backup for unexpected emergencies like blackouts, floods or earthquakes.
[00:59:23.480 --> 00:59:26.502]  It's simply the best personal water filtration system available.
[00:59:26.822 --> 00:59:30.264]  So effective you can drink raw, untreated water from lakes, rivers and streams.
[00:59:30.604 --> 00:59:39.989]  Unlike other sport bottles, the Sport Berkey's patented filter formulation is so powerful it removes cysts, parasites, harmful bacteria, and chemicals like herbicides and pesticides.
[00:59:40.249 --> 00:59:43.770]  It even reduces radon-222, lead, and other heavy metals.
[00:59:44.011 --> 00:59:51.154]  This lightweight, rugged 22-ounce filter is small enough to go everywhere, so take one to work and keep another in your glove box for emergencies.

[00:59:58.178 --> 00:59:58.878]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:58.918 --> 00:59:59.799]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:59.819 --> 01:00:00.540]  You want answers?
[01:00:00.560 --> 01:00:01.000]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:21.346 --> 01:00:25.047]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:25.528 --> 01:00:29.609]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:30.370 --> 01:00:32.550]  Toll-free number to join us in this hour is 1-800-259-9231.
[01:00:39.421 --> 01:00:46.242]  Marjorie Cohn, the law professor, talked about the end of the Bill of Rights, secret arrest, secret torture, secret execution of U.S.
[01:00:46.282 --> 01:00:46.662]  citizens.
[01:00:47.082 --> 01:00:49.203]  She's joining us for 15 minutes in the next hour.
[01:00:49.683 --> 01:00:53.404]  Michael Rivero gives us his monthly visit coming up after this break.
[01:00:53.424 --> 01:00:56.864]  We will have to take a lot of calls this hour with Mike Rivero.
[01:00:57.765 --> 01:00:59.945]  Also, North Korea says it will conduct nuclear tests.
[01:01:00.025 --> 01:01:01.885]  North Korea says it will stage a nuke test.
[01:01:02.665 --> 01:01:03.846]  And the U.S.
[01:01:03.906 --> 01:01:05.306]  is saying it's an unacceptable threat.
[01:01:06.002 --> 01:01:09.545]  Again, we've got to attack Iran, but North Korea is threatening to nuke us and doing nuke tests.
[01:01:10.025 --> 01:01:10.865]  That's just great.
[01:01:11.226 --> 01:01:14.188]  I want to read part of this editorial once Michael Rivera is on with us.
[01:01:14.648 --> 01:01:17.150]  Fatal vision, the deeper evil behind the detainee bill.
[01:01:17.210 --> 01:01:19.291]  Great report by Chris Floyd.
[01:01:20.572 --> 01:01:28.778]  I just got into mind control in the last hour and how, from my sources, they use the Amish community as a cover for some of these operations.
[01:01:28.798 --> 01:01:30.339]  We've talked about that in the past, and here it is.
[01:01:30.919 --> 01:01:31.740]  Surprise, surprise.
[01:01:32.726 --> 01:01:34.287]  It is admitted it is a declassified.
[01:01:34.347 --> 01:01:38.209]  We covered some of that in the last hour for those that... It's just like the North American Union.
[01:01:38.229 --> 01:01:39.250]  You heard it was a conspiracy?
[01:01:39.290 --> 01:01:39.890]  No, it's real.
[01:01:40.290 --> 01:01:41.631]  It's like weather modification.
[01:01:41.671 --> 01:01:42.892]  Declassified public.
[01:01:43.272 --> 01:01:43.552]  Okay?
[01:01:43.572 --> 01:01:44.353]  Mainstream news now.
[01:01:44.413 --> 01:01:44.813]  It's real.
[01:01:45.213 --> 01:01:47.595]  Mind control is as real as Ford Motors.
[01:01:47.675 --> 01:01:47.975]  Okay?
[01:01:48.355 --> 01:01:50.236]  It's as real as Walgreens drugstores.
[01:01:50.576 --> 01:01:51.937]  It's as real as the nose on your face.
[01:01:52.197 --> 01:01:52.918]  It's going on.
[01:01:53.458 --> 01:01:54.459]  Different types of it.
[01:01:54.479 --> 01:01:55.199]  Different strata.
[01:01:55.919 --> 01:01:59.641]  Let's go to Ken in New York, then William, Jeff, Chris, Jim, and others.
[01:01:59.661 --> 01:02:00.602]  Go ahead, Ken.
[01:02:00.922 --> 01:02:01.523]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[01:02:01.543 --> 01:02:01.643]  Hi.
[01:02:02.003 --> 01:02:02.163]  Hi.
[01:02:03.526 --> 01:02:13.550]  At the beginning of your monologue yesterday, you mentioned how when you first saw Mark Foley, I believe on television, that you saw something in his face.
[01:02:13.590 --> 01:02:16.471]  Yeah, I said that guy's a pedophile.
[01:02:16.531 --> 01:02:18.111]  Listen, most of them are already pedophiles.
[01:02:18.732 --> 01:02:20.792]  And yes, you can tell.
[01:02:21.533 --> 01:02:23.894]  This sounds nuts for people that haven't studied these people.
[01:02:24.214 --> 01:02:24.754]  You can tell.
[01:02:25.930 --> 01:02:27.391]  Well, I kind of saw the same thing.
[01:02:27.511 --> 01:02:30.212]  Not on TV, but in a photograph of him.
[01:02:30.232 --> 01:02:32.792]  I think when he first got elected to Congress, whenever that was.
[01:02:33.093 --> 01:02:36.394]  And I kind of saw it right away like you did.
[01:02:36.414 --> 01:02:38.915]  He's an effeminate pervert.
[01:02:39.095 --> 01:02:42.896]  Well, like the beatingness in the eyes or some kind of... They've all got that.
[01:02:43.816 --> 01:02:45.497]  Those perverts all look the same, man.
[01:02:45.937 --> 01:02:53.100]  Look, you can exchange his eyes for that... What was the scumbag's name with the saying he murdered...
[01:02:54.496 --> 01:03:01.299]  The freakish pageant show, JonBenet Ramsey.
[01:03:02.019 --> 01:03:02.720]  Or Carr.
[01:03:03.120 --> 01:03:04.000]  What was that freak's name?
[01:03:05.241 --> 01:03:05.881]  Yeah, Jon Carr.
[01:03:05.901 --> 01:03:09.002]  I'm having a brain fizzle.
[01:03:09.022 --> 01:03:09.462]  But go ahead.
[01:03:09.983 --> 01:03:11.763]  Well, it's interesting.
[01:03:11.803 --> 01:03:15.365]  I think there's a field of psychology, and it's called physiognomy.
[01:03:15.825 --> 01:03:16.605]  Yeah, faces.
[01:03:16.785 --> 01:03:17.065]  Right.
[01:03:17.466 --> 01:03:20.387]  And it reminds me of what you described yesterday.
[01:03:20.547 --> 01:03:20.827]  You didn't...
[01:03:21.497 --> 01:03:22.238]  Elaborate on it.
[01:03:22.318 --> 01:03:26.982]  I mean, you can spend hours on this subject, but I really think it's a given.
[01:03:27.002 --> 01:03:30.144]  It reminds me of a few episodes of The Twilight Zone.
[01:03:30.245 --> 01:03:33.467]  I heard you mention The Twilight Zone a few times.
[01:03:33.487 --> 01:03:41.194]  What's inside their souls eventually is revealed in their faces and in their eyes.
[01:03:41.214 --> 01:03:49.501]  I've saved a few photographs from The New American over the last few months, and I see that same will to power
[01:03:50.542 --> 01:03:52.323]  It's like a fake male facsimile of it.
[01:03:52.363 --> 01:03:54.504]  It's an unnatural facsimile.
[01:04:20.818 --> 01:04:27.581]  Look, look, folks, you can tell when, you know, a flamer's walking down the street, okay?
[01:04:27.821 --> 01:04:30.022]  But this is separate, okay?
[01:04:30.042 --> 01:04:31.283]  I'm not talking about them.
[01:04:32.043 --> 01:04:34.244]  It's something added to it, okay?
[01:04:34.284 --> 01:04:36.825]  And it's like, okay, that's a scumbag.
[01:04:38.106 --> 01:04:39.807]  Well, I think it's epitomized.
[01:04:40.067 --> 01:04:42.728]  Well, you ought to go when CPS is grabbing people's kids.
[01:04:42.768 --> 01:04:45.309]  You always see foleys there at the scene.
[01:04:45.842 --> 01:04:49.024]  They hold their hands up in front of them like meerkats.
[01:04:49.325 --> 01:04:50.405]  They kind of waddle around.
[01:04:50.446 --> 01:04:55.409]  You just want to... I mean, it's just your instinct.
[01:04:55.429 --> 01:04:56.810]  It's like a dog knows who's bad.
[01:04:56.830 --> 01:04:57.831]  Well, I know who's bad.
[01:04:57.851 --> 01:04:59.873]  I know you're scum!
[01:05:00.173 --> 01:05:01.294]  We're coming for you!
[01:05:01.474 --> 01:05:02.795]  We're coming for you, scum!
[01:05:12.086 --> 01:05:15.268]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[01:05:15.629 --> 01:05:17.570]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[01:05:17.930 --> 01:05:25.596]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:05:26.256 --> 01:05:33.301]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:05:33.721 --> 01:05:36.663]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran.
[01:05:36.983 --> 01:05:39.365]  The White House program to disseminate fake news.
[01:05:39.785 --> 01:05:40.606]  NSA spies.
[01:05:41.075 --> 01:05:43.176]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:05:43.196 --> 01:05:46.799]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.
[01:05:46.859 --> 01:05:53.003]  Get your copy today at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling toll 3-1-888-253-3139 or watch it right now online at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:06:08.917 --> 01:06:12.078]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[01:06:12.118 --> 01:06:16.159]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[01:06:16.299 --> 01:06:18.840]  But if you place them on the magnet, all would stick.
[01:06:18.920 --> 01:06:21.240]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[01:06:21.420 --> 01:06:29.863]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 psi, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[01:06:29.943 --> 01:06:31.263]  The Berkey Light is different.
[01:06:31.383 --> 01:06:35.384]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous pack
[01:06:35.404 --> 01:06:39.525]  It is so powerful it purifies raw, untreated water from remote lakes, streams, and stagnant ponds.
[01:06:55.911 --> 01:07:00.794]  Get the Advanced Berkey Light Purifier for only $279 by calling New Millennium, 888-803-4438 or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[01:07:00.874 --> 01:07:01.955]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:07:08.761 --> 01:07:13.062]  If you're tired of spending a small fortune every time you fill up, now you can do something about it.
[01:07:13.302 --> 01:07:19.783]  Ethos FR, a product used all over the world, has reported savings of up to 19% on gas and even reduced emissions of up to 30%.
[01:07:20.523 --> 01:07:25.244]  Ethos FR is easy to use and works with any kind of fuel, including gasoline, diesel, and ethanol.
[01:07:25.424 --> 01:07:32.726]  Ethos FR works by reformulating the gas in your tank to burn more completely, resulting in a cleaner engine, better mileage, more power, and fewer emissions.

[01:07:36.067 --> 01:07:37.767]  That's ctsavegas.com.
[01:07:39.369 --> 01:07:41.850]  Are your Federal Reserve notes looking for a safe haven?
[01:07:42.310 --> 01:07:44.230]  Mine found it in precious metals.
[01:07:44.931 --> 01:07:48.112]  Not paper promises, but actual gold in my possession.
[01:07:48.752 --> 01:07:55.234]  It is liquid, it is private, it owes no one, it cannot go bankrupt, and it maintains its purchasing power.
[01:07:56.014 --> 01:07:58.215]  Find your answer at Midas Resources.
[01:07:58.595 --> 01:07:59.015]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:07:59.115 --> 01:08:00.495]  The answer is at 1-800-686-2237.
[01:08:09.282 --> 01:08:14.946]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:16.787 --> 01:08:18.868]  Chris Floyd writes for U.S.
[01:08:18.928 --> 01:08:20.769]  papers, Russian, British papers.
[01:08:21.810 --> 01:08:22.850]  We've got him coming on Thursday.
[01:08:23.310 --> 01:08:27.213]  In a minute or two, we're going to go to Michael Rivera for his monthly visit with us.
[01:08:27.233 --> 01:08:28.654]  We're always honored to have him.
[01:08:28.974 --> 01:08:30.815]  Let me just read a few paragraphs from this article.
[01:08:31.721 --> 01:08:34.883]  Fatal vision, the deeper evil behind the detainee bill.
[01:08:34.923 --> 01:08:38.166]  This is up on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:08:38.706 --> 01:08:44.210]  There is no week nor day nor hour when tyranny may not enter upon this country.
[01:08:44.690 --> 01:08:50.594]  If the people lose their confidence in themselves and lose their roughness and spirit of defiance.
[01:08:51.475 --> 01:08:52.675]  And that was Walt Whitman.
[01:08:53.576 --> 01:08:54.817]  That's absolutely true.
[01:08:55.598 --> 01:08:56.258]  Let me read that again.
[01:08:56.499 --> 01:09:01.942]  There is no week, nor day, nor hour when tyranny may not enter upon this country.
[01:09:02.263 --> 01:09:02.723]  You understand?
[01:09:02.803 --> 01:09:07.226]  It's like water trying to get into a submarine when it's a thousand feet under the sea.
[01:09:07.426 --> 01:09:08.126]  All that pressure.
[01:09:08.607 --> 01:09:12.870]  There's not a second that water isn't trying to get through all that pressure.
[01:09:13.450 --> 01:09:15.091]  You've got to constantly control government.
[01:09:15.151 --> 01:09:16.292]  Constantly keep it small.
[01:09:16.632 --> 01:09:17.673]  Constantly restrict it.
[01:09:18.430 --> 01:09:21.174]  But the media says, trust it, let it run everything.
[01:09:21.534 --> 01:09:22.816]  It's hateful not to let it.
[01:09:23.537 --> 01:09:24.418]  Oh, government's good.
[01:09:24.438 --> 01:09:26.942]  No, government's very bad because private corporations...
[01:09:27.614 --> 01:09:34.738]  Pay it off, buy it up, take it over, and use it to rape you and your family financially, physically, mentally, spiritually.
[01:09:34.758 --> 01:09:38.581]  Let me just read two paragraphs and we'll go to our esteemed guest.
[01:09:39.121 --> 01:09:50.648]  It was a dark hour indeed on Thursday when the United States Senate voted to end the Constitutional Republic and transform the country into a leader state.
[01:09:51.303 --> 01:09:52.744]  And that's exactly what they've done.
[01:09:53.204 --> 01:10:06.074]  Giving the president and his agents the power to capture, torture, and imprison forever anyone, American citizens included, whom they arbitrarily decide is an enemy combatant.
[01:10:06.614 --> 01:10:11.418]  They also include those who merely give terrorism some kind of support.
[01:10:11.538 --> 01:10:12.959]  We've gone through the subsections.
[01:10:12.979 --> 01:10:14.000]  We'll go over them again today.
[01:10:14.961 --> 01:10:17.863]  It says if you don't have total allegiance to Bush, seek arrest.
[01:10:19.261 --> 01:10:19.882]  It goes on.
[01:10:20.022 --> 01:10:32.736]  Those also include those who merely give terrorism some kind of support, define it so vaguely that many experts say it could encompass legal advice, innocent gifts to charities, or even political opposition to the U.S.
[01:10:32.756 --> 01:10:35.539]  government policy within its draconian structures.
[01:10:36.841 --> 01:10:38.684]  All of this is bad enough.
[01:10:38.704 --> 01:10:49.139]  A sickening and cowardly surrender of liberty not seen in a major western democracy since the Enabling Act passed by the German Reichstag in March of 1933.
[01:10:51.360 --> 01:10:52.320]  February, March.
[01:10:53.001 --> 01:10:55.481]  February 27th, he firebombs the Capitol.
[01:10:56.081 --> 01:10:57.902]  A month later, martial law.
[01:10:58.542 --> 01:11:02.363]  But it is by no means the full extent of our degradation.
[01:11:02.403 --> 01:11:07.585]  In reality, the darkness is deeper and more foul than most people can imagine.
[01:11:08.234 --> 01:11:24.783]  For, in addition to the draconian dictatorial powers of seizure and torture given by Congress on Thursday to George W. Bush, powers he had already seized and exercised for five years anyway, even without this fig leaf of shame legality.
[01:11:25.854 --> 01:11:26.875]  And sham legality.
[01:11:27.295 --> 01:11:42.306]  There is a far more sinister imperial right that Bush has claimed and used openly without any demur or debate from Congress at all, ordering the extrajudicial killing of anyone on earth that he and his deputies decide.
[01:11:42.626 --> 01:11:46.208]  Remember AP and UPI four years ago when Sharon said he'd kill U.S.
[01:11:46.248 --> 01:11:47.389]  citizens inside the U.S.?
[01:11:48.450 --> 01:11:55.535]  Of anyone on earth that he and his deputies decide arbitrarily, without charges, court hearing, formal evidence, or appeal as an enemy combatant.
[01:11:56.164 --> 01:11:56.764]  And it goes on.
[01:11:57.405 --> 01:12:15.297]  Michael Rivero, they've also, as you know, my friend, openly threw down the gauntlet and told all judges, and it's in there, it's illegal, and in a terrorist section, if any judge even hears a case against what they're doing, and Gonzalez got up like a rooster and crowed that they're not allowed to question them.
[01:12:15.537 --> 01:12:17.378]  This is open announcement of dictatorship.
[01:12:17.459 --> 01:12:18.920]  It reminds me of what you said last month.
[01:12:19.340 --> 01:12:21.001]  Make a dictator act like a dictator.
[01:12:21.441 --> 01:12:22.482]  My God, they're doing it.
[01:12:24.068 --> 01:12:25.129]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:12:25.469 --> 01:12:28.351]  And it's frightening to watch.
[01:12:28.471 --> 01:12:33.114]  I mean, on one level, you and I have certainly seen that this has been coming on for a lot of years.
[01:12:33.874 --> 01:12:39.138]  And to look at it actually happening in front of us, it's still a bit of a shock.
[01:12:39.238 --> 01:12:40.458]  I think that was certainly my case.
[01:12:40.939 --> 01:12:41.979]  It's staggering.
[01:12:42.640 --> 01:12:48.383]  Michael, were you grieving and staggering Friday when it finally officially passed both chambers?
[01:12:48.423 --> 01:12:50.665]  Because I was literally staggering around.
[01:12:51.707 --> 01:12:52.848]  Yeah, it was.
[01:12:54.129 --> 01:13:06.856]  And I couldn't understand why I was in such shock, because I'd seen it coming, and yet when it actually happened, it was just like, you know, everything that I've ever believed in about this country just went away, and it is very frightening to see it happen.
[01:13:07.337 --> 01:13:20.645]  And what is amazing to me is, and almost tragic, and this is again a repeat of what happened in Germany, is we're still seeing a lot of Americans who are shaking their heads and saying, well, yeah, I guess it's a bad thing,
[01:13:21.252 --> 01:13:27.955]  But they just don't seem to, you know, we're not seeing the anger that I think the situation should justify.
[01:13:29.415 --> 01:13:33.057]  Well, that's because they instantly gave us the pervert Mark Foley story.
[01:13:33.077 --> 01:13:35.918]  I wish they'd talk about dying core slave rings.
[01:13:35.938 --> 01:13:36.978]  It was in the Chicago Tribune.
[01:13:36.998 --> 01:13:38.599]  But they don't talk about that real scandal.
[01:13:38.619 --> 01:13:40.380]  No, it's all pervert Foley.
[01:13:40.420 --> 01:13:42.120]  Notice how that popped up right on time.
[01:13:42.320 --> 01:13:42.961]  They'd known about it.
[01:13:43.021 --> 01:13:46.502]  Now it turns out for two years, FBI had been on it since July.
[01:13:47.022 --> 01:13:48.383]  Is that a little too opportune?
[01:13:49.620 --> 01:13:59.826]  Well, I wondered at first if this wasn't a distraction, but unfortunately the damage that it's causing to the GOP right now, I'm not sure who blew the whistle at this particular time.
[01:13:59.846 --> 01:14:01.687]  Do you think it's intramural warfare?
[01:14:01.707 --> 01:14:09.511]  Yes, I would definitely say it would be intramural warfare, because I don't for one second believe that the scandal is confined just to one political party.
[01:14:10.412 --> 01:14:18.196]  And it may just be that somebody on the Democratic side decided that they'd better start playing the game the way Karl Rove does, or they're going to lose in November.
[01:14:18.763 --> 01:14:20.964]  But this one does seem to be unraveling.
[01:14:20.984 --> 01:14:25.446]  ABC News is reporting that a lot more congressmen are going to get caught up.
[01:14:25.626 --> 01:14:25.846]  Oh, yeah.
[01:14:25.906 --> 01:14:29.667]  Congressmen are delivering pages for nightly visits with Perv Boyd.
[01:14:31.348 --> 01:14:32.068]  Absolutely.
[01:14:32.408 --> 01:14:39.511]  And, you know, we're already hearing where some of the former pages in the White House are being threatened to keep their mouths shut.
[01:14:40.191 --> 01:14:43.913]  So this could track all the way back to the Franklin scandal.
[01:14:44.782 --> 01:14:54.364]  And yes, it is a distraction from what the dictatorship is doing, but on the other hand, when you talk about the sexual exploitation of children, that gets to people at a gut, instinctive level.
[01:14:54.624 --> 01:14:56.704]  These are scum enemies.
[01:14:56.764 --> 01:14:59.485]  So literally, we're talking about a deck of, say, 50 cards.
[01:14:59.505 --> 01:15:01.465]  15 or 20 of them are wild cards.
[01:15:01.866 --> 01:15:08.867]  Now, the government controls the other cards, but those wild cards are the no-bid contracts, the trillions missing, the perv networks.
[01:15:09.887 --> 01:15:15.028]  All the normal stuff with Porter Goss and cash payoffs and hooker rooms.
[01:15:15.448 --> 01:15:24.230]  I mean, they've got so many things spinning around them that I agree that that's the ace in the hole we've got.
[01:15:24.290 --> 01:15:25.450]  These people are so corrupt.
[01:15:25.470 --> 01:15:27.070]  Their hubris was so out of control.
[01:15:27.310 --> 01:15:30.551]  The criminology shows that psychopaths always want to get caught.
[01:15:30.771 --> 01:15:37.172]  They've gotten so sloppy that any day now they could blow an aorta, couldn't they?
[01:15:38.303 --> 01:15:43.248]  Well, I certainly hope so, because I tend to view the power structure within Washington, D.C.
[01:15:43.808 --> 01:15:51.896]  as this construction of, to use a visible metaphor, sticks and wires.
[01:15:52.738 --> 01:16:02.226]  Sort of like one of these mobile sculptures, and it's strung piano wire tight, and all it's going to take is for one of those wires to snap, and the whole thing is just going to tear itself apart.
[01:16:02.246 --> 01:16:11.473]  Well, you just described the two symbols on either side of the dais in the Senate, the fascia, the sticks bound by the cords, the symbol of fascism with the axes on the top.
[01:16:12.418 --> 01:16:13.418]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:16:13.678 --> 01:16:23.781]  And, you know, I think we're reaching a point, and part of it is, unfortunately, there has been so much lately of government abuse that I think, to some extent, people are getting a little bit numb to it.
[01:16:24.161 --> 01:16:31.603]  But at some point, there has to be a flashpoint where Americans are just going to have to get angry because, you know, that is the obvious next step.
[01:16:31.983 --> 01:16:35.824]  And sometimes I wonder, why aren't more Americans getting angry at what's going on?
[01:16:36.224 --> 01:16:41.786]  I mean, we've had the government now for months trying to tarnish the Internet, the blogs,
[01:16:42.796 --> 01:16:46.939]  As havens for child sexual predators and to try and pass laws controlling what we can.
[01:16:46.959 --> 01:16:48.240]  This is the very guy.
[01:16:48.260 --> 01:16:52.844]  Foley was the one spearheading all that and heading up the missing and exploited children.
[01:16:53.644 --> 01:16:54.445]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:16:54.525 --> 01:16:58.148]  Now we find out that he himself was a big part of that problem.
[01:16:58.988 --> 01:17:06.414]  And again, going back to the Franklin scandal, that this may in fact be part of the undercurrent of Washington, D.C.
[01:17:06.494 --> 01:17:09.436]  And a point I made on my website earlier today is that
[01:17:09.998 --> 01:17:17.241]  A lot of people have been scratching their heads over why Congress keeps voting Bush these enabling acts, these new powers.
[01:17:17.281 --> 01:17:18.362]  He's blackmailing them!
[01:17:19.122 --> 01:17:20.883]  Yeah, exactly the point.
[01:17:21.163 --> 01:17:27.926]  Even politicians who will speak out publicly saying, I have reservations about this, at the last second they flip over and they vote for it.
[01:17:28.406 --> 01:17:38.330]  So I think at this point we need to start questioning whether some of these people who are voting for these acts are really doing so because they think it's the best possible thing for the country,
[01:17:38.786 --> 01:17:44.112]  Or if they're being coerced because they have been lured into various indiscretions and traps.
[01:17:44.152 --> 01:17:48.057]  Oh yeah, we know they're blackmailing them.
[01:17:48.077 --> 01:17:49.899]  A lot of them is just cash they've taken.
[01:17:50.440 --> 01:17:52.182]  A lot of it is the hookers.
[01:17:52.222 --> 01:17:53.383]  A lot of it's pedophilia.
[01:17:53.403 --> 01:17:54.604]  A lot of it's gay sex.
[01:17:55.025 --> 01:17:57.588]  I mean, we know that they're blackmailing most of them.
[01:17:58.658 --> 01:18:11.105]  Yeah, and it really is to a point where, you know, I think we're almost at the point where it is too late to work within the system because the system has gone totally corrupt.
[01:18:11.426 --> 01:18:18.049]  And there's a saying that we used to put on our coffee mugs around here which was that the moral and the immoral are mutually exclusive societies.
[01:18:18.550 --> 01:18:20.711]  Neither one tolerates the presence of the other.
[01:18:21.184 --> 01:18:29.409]  And what that means is when you start getting that corruption and rot into a governmental system, they don't want moral people around anymore because they just get in the way of the fun and games.
[01:18:29.429 --> 01:18:30.269]  Well, that's how it begins.
[01:18:30.369 --> 01:18:40.275]  Immoral criminals first get into some positions of power, then they recruit their own people, they bring in their own people, then they kick everybody out, then they put in new criminal paradigms, and that's now happened.
[01:18:40.295 --> 01:18:42.136]  The government's gone totally rogue.
[01:18:42.396 --> 01:18:46.999]  That's why there's just a mad snatching and looting and greedily grabbing everything.
[01:18:47.938 --> 01:19:10.704]  Yeah, absolutely, and I think what the average American needs to realize, and I hope that they will wake up to this before we have to pay the same price that Germany did, is that, you know, working within the system and voting in the crooked voting machines and everything is not enough anymore, that it's going to take some direct action, perhaps Gandhi-esque non-cooperation.
[01:19:10.744 --> 01:19:16.666]  We're going to see an event on the 5th of this month, which is starting to look more and more like a general strike-taking shape,
[01:19:17.795 --> 01:19:27.341]  But, you know, clearly we're at the point where working within the system is just not going to affect any change because the system has been altered to preclude any changes.
[01:19:29.122 --> 01:19:30.023]  Well, exactly.
[01:19:30.043 --> 01:19:34.505]  I mean, if you're going to have tyranny, you can't have voting, so that's why they've put in the fraud systems.
[01:19:35.206 --> 01:19:41.670]  Well, upon the contrary, once we have a tyranny, voting will become mandatory because that's the hallmark of all dictatorships is you must vote.
[01:19:41.690 --> 01:19:42.430]  Well, exactly.
[01:19:42.470 --> 01:19:45.312]  They're going to make everyone vote in the scam, take part in the fraud.
[01:19:46.534 --> 01:19:46.954]  Exactly.
[01:19:47.215 --> 01:19:48.896]  Just like it was in Russia under Stalin.
[01:19:49.616 --> 01:19:57.402]  Since you brought up Foley, let's get into... Have you seen this clip of him on America's Most Wanted?
[01:19:59.343 --> 01:19:59.944]  No, I haven't.
[01:20:00.064 --> 01:20:01.124]  Is it the Clinton quote?
[01:20:01.165 --> 01:20:02.225]  No, no, no.
[01:20:02.285 --> 01:20:06.028]  This is Mark Foley saying he's going to catch the pedophiles.
[01:20:06.468 --> 01:20:07.269]  We'll come back and play it.
[01:20:09.463 --> 01:20:12.345]  Are terrorist cells or prime terror targets located near you?
[01:20:12.705 --> 01:20:15.566]  Where are military bases and hazardous waste sites located?
[01:20:15.806 --> 01:20:21.990]  How do you find the best area for solar, average rainfall, fish contamination advisories, and major transportation routes?
[01:20:22.370 --> 01:20:29.694]  In the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA, you will find the information you want with over 50 interactive parameters that you control.

[01:21:04.190 --> 01:21:14.735]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson, here for the 2007 Red Book.
[01:21:15.935 --> 01:21:20.757]  The commodity markets like gold, silver, copper, aluminum and oil have exploded over the last year.
[01:21:20.977 --> 01:21:23.699]  This is a glaring testimony of how quickly the U.S.
[01:21:23.739 --> 01:21:24.879]  dollar can be devalued.
[01:21:26.200 --> 01:21:30.782]  Many have turned to precious metals to provide a safe haven while increasing the potential profits.
[01:21:31.724 --> 01:21:38.989]  Though accumulating precious metals has been a proven method for the storage of wealth, it is important that you understand the market you are getting into.
[01:21:39.990 --> 01:21:43.052]  Midas Resources is offering the Red Book and Silver Dollar for only $27.95.
[01:21:43.953 --> 01:21:48.656]  The Red Book is the number one best-selling guide to gold and silver coins.

[01:21:54.420 --> 01:22:00.264]  If you've already accumulated or plan to get into the precious metals market, you simply must have the Red Book in your library.
[01:22:00.968 --> 01:22:01.249]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:22:01.269 --> 01:22:01.569]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:22:09.777 --> 01:22:12.358]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[01:22:12.938 --> 01:22:18.000]  Did you know that the United Nations has never settled disputes, but always makes them worse?
[01:22:18.840 --> 01:22:22.802]  Our own ambassador to the United Nations in 1982 admitted such.
[01:22:23.402 --> 01:22:31.745]  Did you know that the United Nations ignores communist atrocities, but always targets non-communist nations and their leaders for overthrow?
[01:22:32.805 --> 01:22:43.250]  We would like to help you understand why these things are happening and how they fulfill Bible prophecy by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[01:23:33.868 --> 01:23:37.709]  Bath salts release toxins as they soften and rehydrate the skin.
[01:23:38.109 --> 01:23:41.930]  Pretty salt lamps to ionize the air and reduce EMF radiation.
[01:23:42.410 --> 01:23:44.671]  So many different cell products available for you.
[01:23:45.111 --> 01:23:46.652]  It's time to let the secret out.

[01:24:19.591 --> 01:24:27.093]  All right, so here is your average prototype congressman, a pervert.
[01:24:28.493 --> 01:24:29.373]  The news is coming out.
[01:24:29.413 --> 01:24:32.393]  It's going to be all the evidence shows pedophile.
[01:24:32.894 --> 01:24:36.794]  Late night little special visits with 15- and 16-year-old pages.
[01:24:39.355 --> 01:24:40.535]  Here is a clip of him.
[01:24:40.775 --> 01:24:46.736]  Now, this is America's Most Wanted with a host of America's Most Wanted out front the Capitol, and there's all the honking and cars and trucks.
[01:24:47.390 --> 01:24:50.311]  But you can hear the audio, and it's Foley talking to him at the end.
[01:24:50.351 --> 01:24:55.634]  He says, gee, if I was one of these sickos, I'd be scared with America's Most Wanted out there.
[01:24:55.654 --> 01:24:59.976]  And then the head of America's Most Wanted says, once we've convicted them, take their DNA.
[01:25:00.456 --> 01:25:01.597]  Well, that's already been done.
[01:25:01.917 --> 01:25:03.578]  But they want a unified federal database.
[01:25:03.938 --> 01:25:06.099]  And then Foley says, I just think they lose all their rights.
[01:25:06.399 --> 01:25:07.239]  Go ahead and take it.
[01:25:07.860 --> 01:25:10.461]  And this is a guy pushing through all this draconian legislation.
[01:25:10.481 --> 01:25:12.562]  It has nothing to do with pedophiles, folks.
[01:25:12.582 --> 01:25:14.123]  It's about everybody losing their freedoms.
[01:25:14.383 --> 01:25:14.923]  Here's the clip.
[01:25:15.734 --> 01:25:21.176]  We track library books better than we track pedophiles and kids that are missing.
[01:25:21.196 --> 01:25:29.898]  We've got to force states to incorporate technology, share information, because we can't take another loss of life of a child.
[01:25:30.698 --> 01:25:35.900]  I believe that every convicted felon should be mandated nationwide to give his DNA.
[01:25:36.320 --> 01:25:40.621]  It solves crimes, it gets innocent people out of prison, and it will
[01:25:41.497 --> 01:25:46.464]  It will eliminate the ability of these people to roam state to state in this country and rape people.
[01:25:47.166 --> 01:25:50.030]  From my view, when you rape a person, when you violate a child,
[01:25:53.007 --> 01:26:08.992]  Well, good luck with your piece of legislation, because you're right, it will put some teeth into these registries.
[01:26:09.312 --> 01:26:14.534]  Well, if I were one of these sickos, I'd be nervous with America's Most Wanted on my trail.
[01:26:15.074 --> 01:26:16.354]  Well, I wish I could catch all of those.
[01:26:17.414 --> 01:26:19.035]  What'd you think of that, Michael Rivera?
[01:26:19.978 --> 01:26:21.279]  Well, definitely.
[01:26:22.620 --> 01:26:26.524]  It's sort of like Jeffrey Dahmer lecturing us all about the evils of cannibalism, I think.
[01:26:27.645 --> 01:26:33.850]  The hypocrisy is definitely... Well, it's not really shocking.
[01:26:34.131 --> 01:26:37.994]  It's the sort of thing you've come to expect from these kind of people.
[01:26:38.454 --> 01:26:38.855]  But I...
[01:26:40.783 --> 01:26:45.946]  You know, I'm a guy who really doesn't understand this whole child sexual predator thing.
[01:26:46.846 --> 01:26:49.788]  And I don't even pretend to understand or comprehend what's going on here.
[01:26:49.828 --> 01:26:50.308]  Exactly.
[01:26:50.568 --> 01:26:58.653]  I mean, I'm attracted to robust, deluptuous, beautiful women with their sparkly eyes and their power.
[01:26:59.213 --> 01:27:01.034]  I mean, that's what I'm attracted to.
[01:27:01.054 --> 01:27:02.015]  I'm attracted to my wife.
[01:27:02.555 --> 01:27:06.157]  How in the world are these sickos attracted to children?
[01:27:06.877 --> 01:27:07.538]  I mean, it's just...
[01:27:09.269 --> 01:27:10.569]  Sorry, go ahead.
[01:27:10.709 --> 01:27:11.850]  It's beyond imagination.
[01:27:12.070 --> 01:27:17.612]  I do know that I have a very strong, instinctive response to hearing these stories.
[01:27:18.772 --> 01:27:19.352]  It's violent.
[01:27:19.432 --> 01:27:20.433]  No, it's violent.
[01:27:20.493 --> 01:27:21.373]  It's revulsion, yeah.
[01:27:21.773 --> 01:27:22.653]  It's not violence.
[01:27:22.713 --> 01:27:23.434]  I feel violent.
[01:27:24.094 --> 01:27:28.855]  Yeah, but I think in this case, we're going to go back to the words of President Richard M. Nixon.
[01:27:30.156 --> 01:27:33.717]  The lesson that he learned, it isn't the crime that's going to do you in.
[01:27:33.837 --> 01:27:35.298]  It's going to be that cover-up.
[01:27:35.458 --> 01:27:36.298]  And fully, if
[01:27:37.562 --> 01:27:42.045]  He'd been outed when he was just starting to do this stuff and allowed to take his fall.
[01:27:42.745 --> 01:27:44.446]  It would be forgotten history by now.
[01:27:44.786 --> 01:27:52.231]  But the real scandal that is brewing isn't just that Foley was sending these very explicit emails.
[01:27:52.291 --> 01:27:56.353]  But the Republican leadership, Dennis Hastert and others, for years covered it up.
[01:27:57.093 --> 01:27:58.354]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:27:58.954 --> 01:28:03.717]  And I'm trying to recall, I haven't been able to find a copy of it yet,
[01:28:04.110 --> 01:28:13.335]  But apparently Hunter S. Thompson, one of the articles he was working on when he died... No, no, I talked to the reporters at the Toronto Star and another one who were good friends with him.
[01:28:13.375 --> 01:28:17.858]  He was doing a report on a congressional pedophile scandal when he got his head blown off.
[01:28:18.799 --> 01:28:26.043]  Yeah, and I think that what we're looking at, given the overlapping time, is that possibly he was looking into...
[01:28:27.170 --> 01:28:42.460]  You know, again... No, no, I have confirmed with two different Canadian reporters that were personal friends of him, one of them talked to him a week before he died, that he was doing a White House slash congressional underage callboy ring at the Capitol in the White House.
[01:28:44.662 --> 01:28:49.105]  Well, I think there's definitely an issue there that, you know...
[01:28:49.776 --> 01:28:51.076]  It has to be looked at.
[01:28:51.136 --> 01:28:57.438]  And again, if you go back to the Franklin scandal, it looks like this has sort of been an ongoing part of the political landscape for quite some time.
[01:28:57.698 --> 01:28:58.458]  Oh, yeah.
[01:28:58.478 --> 01:29:01.479]  By the way, have you heard the latest Tony Snow on CNN?
[01:29:01.519 --> 01:29:07.161]  Tony Snow, the Fox operative, White House operative always, and lying about it now, White House press secretary.
[01:29:07.401 --> 01:29:07.841]  We have the clip.
[01:29:07.861 --> 01:29:08.761]  We'll play it in the next hour.
[01:29:08.781 --> 01:29:09.821]  Or maybe we can isolate.
[01:29:09.861 --> 01:29:10.882]  We play it in the next segment.
[01:29:10.922 --> 01:29:11.842]  But I want to take calls.
[01:29:12.842 --> 01:29:13.863]  It's just a fraternity hazing.
[01:29:13.883 --> 01:29:14.023]  Yeah.
[01:29:42.575 --> 01:29:42.855]  No, no.
[01:29:42.995 --> 01:29:47.379]  Naughty is stealing a cookie out of the cookie jar, okay?
[01:29:48.140 --> 01:29:54.184]  I tell you, I mean, just by that statement, that pretty much makes Tony Snow a pervert supporter.
[01:29:54.985 --> 01:29:56.486]  I'm so sick of all these perverts.
[01:29:59.489 --> 01:30:00.389]  We're on the march.
[01:30:00.870 --> 01:30:02.471]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:30:02.491 --> 01:30:06.094]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:09.818 --> 01:30:12.300]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network.
[01:30:12.420 --> 01:30:14.781]  I have an urgent message for all of our listeners.
[01:30:14.841 --> 01:30:21.925]  The mass media keeps telling us that we are the richest, most powerful economy in the world, quote-unquote.
[01:30:22.506 --> 01:30:24.807]  If this is true, why can't we pay our bills?
[01:30:25.468 --> 01:30:28.990]  Why is the United States the world's largest debtor nation?
[01:30:29.550 --> 01:30:33.673]  The truth is that we are in the worst debt bubble in our nation's history.
[01:30:34.253 --> 01:30:37.215]  When the bubble bursts, will you be able to feed your family?
[01:30:38.197 --> 01:30:41.118]  When the inevitable crash occurs, will you be ready?
[01:30:41.858 --> 01:30:47.859]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.
[01:30:47.939 --> 01:30:50.940]  That's 1-888-892-6238.
[01:30:51.180 --> 01:30:55.761]  For the following two free reports, U.S.
[01:30:55.861 --> 01:30:58.762]  Debt Bubble, Red Alert, and Real Estate Crash.
[01:30:59.722 --> 01:31:02.023]  Call 888-8XANADU.
[01:31:02.083 --> 01:31:06.264]  That's 888-8XANADU.
[01:31:06.604 --> 01:31:07.564]  And ask for George.
[01:31:09.007 --> 01:31:12.590]  Do you know where the 78 potentially active volcanoes in the U.S.
[01:31:12.630 --> 01:31:13.130]  are located?
[01:31:13.330 --> 01:31:16.712]  And do you know the locations of the top 300 prime terrorist targets?
[01:31:16.932 --> 01:31:21.656]  You can find these answers and more in the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA.
[01:31:21.936 --> 01:31:26.919]  With the more than 50 interactive parameters, you can pinpoint natural and man-made disaster areas.
[01:31:27.119 --> 01:31:27.780]  We're good to go.
[01:31:46.841 --> 01:31:49.884]  That's 888-803-4438 to order on the web or at BerkeyWater.com.
[01:32:08.795 --> 01:32:10.958]  Admit it, the moral rot in America runs deep.
[01:32:11.358 --> 01:32:17.947]  Massive debt, rampant materialism, pedophilia by clergy, endless war, and yes, the sin of religious cannibalism.
[01:32:18.227 --> 01:32:24.675]  Communion was practiced by the Aztecs, Egyptians, Babylonians, and Gnostics of the Mystery Schools long before the Messiah was born.
[01:32:24.996 --> 01:32:27.619]  Due to carefully placed forgeries within the New Covenant texts,
[01:32:28.039 --> 01:32:28.499]  We're good to go.
[01:32:28.519 --> 01:32:29.200]  We're good to go.
[01:32:47.987 --> 01:32:58.738]  Yes, Gnostics did hijack the Antique to fulfill their devious plan to make abomination look holy.
[01:32:58.998 --> 01:33:03.042]  Gnostic conspiracy exposed in Communion Bloodfest of Babylon.
[01:33:03.262 --> 01:33:03.443]  Call 325-572-3913.
[01:33:09.661 --> 01:33:11.962]  We're good to go.
[01:33:39.998 --> 01:33:41.500]  Like a man would do a woman.
[01:33:41.900 --> 01:33:43.882]  Like a man would do his wife or girlfriend.
[01:33:45.083 --> 01:33:47.005]  I mean, it's sick, folks.
[01:33:47.045 --> 01:33:47.786]  You can do it right out.
[01:33:48.046 --> 01:33:48.947]  Oh, look at the emperor!
[01:33:49.007 --> 01:33:50.068]  No one saw that!
[01:33:50.949 --> 01:33:52.111]  No one saw that!
[01:33:52.911 --> 01:33:55.014]  Then another occasion he kissed him on top of the head.
[01:33:55.034 --> 01:33:57.716]  And Bush, though, goes both ways.
[01:33:57.756 --> 01:33:59.518]  It's obvious he also is constantly kissing.
[01:34:00.259 --> 01:34:03.302]  Condi on the lips and holding hands at baseball games, were there?
[01:34:04.491 --> 01:34:07.933]  It's an absolute... Bush is a complete monkey, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:34:08.093 --> 01:34:09.854]  Just a little greebling monkey.
[01:34:10.854 --> 01:34:11.695]  Well, that's too kind.
[01:34:11.735 --> 01:34:12.635]  Monkeys are pretty nice.
[01:34:13.536 --> 01:34:23.421]  I was going to go to calls here in a minute, and I wasn't going to go to William in Arkansas, but he hung up, so we'll go to Jeff and Chris and John and Jim and everybody else, but I wanted to plug my videos first.
[01:34:23.441 --> 01:34:24.841]  You know, that's what funds us.
[01:34:24.861 --> 01:34:26.502]  It's what allows us to operate.
[01:34:27.783 --> 01:34:31.605]  I try not to belabor the documentary films here on air.
[01:34:31.625 --> 01:34:33.486]  Number one, they're such a big part...
[01:34:34.336 --> 01:34:35.697]  Of the solution.
[01:34:38.418 --> 01:34:39.439]  You are authorized.
[01:34:39.459 --> 01:34:40.400]  You are encouraged.
[01:34:40.440 --> 01:34:42.881]  You are formally requested.
[01:34:42.981 --> 01:34:48.984]  I am asking you to get my videos and to aggressively make copies of them.
[01:34:49.024 --> 01:34:49.645]  Yes, you.
[01:34:49.705 --> 01:34:51.586]  I'm talking to all of you out there.
[01:34:52.086 --> 01:34:56.589]  Especially if you already have the videos in your library and you haven't made copies of them.
[01:34:56.769 --> 01:34:58.150]  Start making copies.
[01:34:58.790 --> 01:34:59.150]  Burn them.
[01:34:59.450 --> 01:35:00.671]  Go get a DVD burner.
[01:35:01.730 --> 01:35:06.154]  Burn copies of Road to Tyranny, Martial Law, my newest, Terror Storm.
[01:35:06.694 --> 01:35:07.996]  Get them out to people.
[01:35:08.716 --> 01:35:10.538]  Hey, don't send me a donation, okay?
[01:35:10.838 --> 01:35:13.260]  I mean, some people do sometimes, and it really does help.
[01:35:14.041 --> 01:35:21.167]  But I would rather you take my DVD and go to a DVD manufacturer or go buy a burner.
[01:35:21.187 --> 01:35:25.451]  They've got big burners for like $1,000 that will burn ten at a time or seven at a time.
[01:35:26.371 --> 01:35:27.472]  Start burning them.
[01:35:27.512 --> 01:35:27.953]  Just start...
[01:35:28.943 --> 01:35:31.144]  That's how you donate to America.
[01:35:31.184 --> 01:35:32.945]  That's how you defeat the New World Order.
[01:35:33.586 --> 01:35:37.508]  I want to bring the terrorists that carried out 9-11 to justice!
[01:35:38.168 --> 01:35:39.309]  That's what I want!
[01:35:40.349 --> 01:35:40.770]  Okay?
[01:35:42.110 --> 01:35:44.251]  And so I want you to get Terror Storm.
[01:35:44.291 --> 01:35:45.952]  It's the most powerful film I've ever made.
[01:35:46.152 --> 01:35:48.694]  I believe it's the best film exposing ever-sponsored terror.
[01:35:48.994 --> 01:35:52.976]  The history of it, 7-7, 9-11, the Iraq War, the torture, the spying.
[01:35:53.276 --> 01:35:54.297]  It's all in there.

[01:36:02.019 --> 01:36:03.600]  There's also PrisonPlanet.tv, 15 cents a day.
[01:36:18.573 --> 01:36:20.394]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:36:20.694 --> 01:36:21.375]  For a month, it's $5.95.
[01:36:21.815 --> 01:36:34.684]  That helps you pay for the bandwidth, my webmasters, what we're doing here, all 15 of my films, my weekly TV reports, my book, Paul Watson's book, my best audio interviews, and a bunch of other films have been authorized to post up there.
[01:36:35.364 --> 01:36:36.425]  Great activist tool.
[01:36:36.465 --> 01:36:38.086]  Go burn copies of all my films.
[01:36:38.106 --> 01:36:39.687]  We've got it in super high bandwidth.
[01:36:39.727 --> 01:36:43.870]  If you've got a T1 or great cable modem, you can download these things.
[01:36:43.910 --> 01:36:45.071]  It's almost as good as TV.
[01:36:45.091 --> 01:36:46.152]  I mean, it looks so clear.
[01:36:46.972 --> 01:36:48.213]  Burn them on disk that way.
[01:36:48.740 --> 01:36:53.603]  That's really a great way to do it with your time because it's so fast.
[01:36:55.004 --> 01:36:57.705]  PrisonPlanet.tv, or let's say you don't want to pay 15 cents a day.
[01:36:57.965 --> 01:36:58.266]  Great.
[01:36:59.006 --> 01:36:59.686]  Google Video.
[01:36:59.706 --> 01:37:01.687]  There's some pretty good quality versions up there.
[01:37:01.848 --> 01:37:04.769]  It's not as good as the member site, but it's pretty darn good.
[01:37:05.310 --> 01:37:12.394]  Some of the versions are cruddy up there other people put up, but if it says high quality or deluxe, there's some pretty good copies on Google Video.
[01:37:12.434 --> 01:37:13.954]  I think there's a way to burn those to disk.
[01:37:13.995 --> 01:37:14.555]  I'm not sure.
[01:37:15.271 --> 01:37:17.692]  But type Terror Storm into Google.
[01:37:17.712 --> 01:37:18.753]  We've got links on the site.
[01:37:19.773 --> 01:37:20.393]  I spent almost $100,000.
[01:37:20.453 --> 01:37:21.434]  I kept saying $85,000.
[01:37:21.934 --> 01:37:23.054]  It's more like $95,000.
[01:37:23.094 --> 01:37:24.715]  I just did my accounting.
[01:37:25.255 --> 01:37:28.477]  I spent $95,000 on making a film, and I go, here, have it for free.
[01:37:28.857 --> 01:37:30.778]  See, because it's about survival!
[01:37:32.138 --> 01:37:35.100]  So please, tell everyone about Terror Storm, and don't stop.
[01:37:35.360 --> 01:37:35.860]  Help us!
[01:37:37.077 --> 01:37:38.018]  Okay, I'm going to shut up.
[01:37:38.038 --> 01:37:39.579]  We're going to talk to Mike Rivero.
[01:37:39.599 --> 01:37:41.480]  We're going to go to your calls here in just a few minutes.
[01:37:42.040 --> 01:37:48.244]  Michael Rivero, how important is it for people to tell everybody they know about Infowars.com or WhatReallyHappened.com?
[01:37:48.484 --> 01:37:53.907]  How important is it for people right now to put out a maximum effort exposing who the real terrorists are?
[01:37:55.308 --> 01:37:58.710]  It is incredibly important, and it's important for two reasons.
[01:37:58.750 --> 01:38:01.752]  The first of which is, of course, to get that information out there.
[01:38:02.962 --> 01:38:04.863]  So the public to counter the mainstream media.
[01:38:05.163 --> 01:38:11.564]  The second one is that when people see you speak out, it gives them the courage to speak out.
[01:38:11.844 --> 01:38:19.506]  Because one of the biggest delusions the government tries to maintain is that anybody who's dissatisfied with the government, who doesn't trust the government, is a loner.
[01:38:19.566 --> 01:38:20.267]  They're all alone.
[01:38:20.327 --> 01:38:21.727]  Nobody else feels that way.
[01:38:22.067 --> 01:38:25.668]  And their idea is to, and this is also the reason for all this surveillance,
[01:38:26.050 --> 01:38:26.651]  We're good to go.
[01:38:39.306 --> 01:38:44.409]  Everybody around you will say, well, boy, I feel the same way myself, and I thought I was all alone about that.
[01:38:44.429 --> 01:38:44.809]  That's right.
[01:38:44.829 --> 01:38:46.570]  So now I'm going to have the courage to speak out.
[01:38:46.730 --> 01:38:49.831]  Their final illusion is that we're all alone.
[01:38:49.891 --> 01:38:52.332]  In truth, the polls all show it across the board.
[01:38:52.352 --> 01:38:59.336]  This is some flute poll, that we're the vast majority, that 85% of Americans totally distrust both parties now.
[01:38:59.376 --> 01:39:00.436]  That's never happened before.
[01:39:00.877 --> 01:39:05.739]  That there's a revolution in progress, but everybody feels like they're alone.
[01:39:05.799 --> 01:39:07.780]  That's the final illusion, and...
[01:39:08.440 --> 01:39:11.301]  Mike, as you know, if that falls, we beat these bastards.
[01:39:12.102 --> 01:39:12.742]  Absolutely.
[01:39:12.922 --> 01:39:13.523]  Absolutely.
[01:39:14.743 --> 01:39:15.984]  Do you have hope for the future?
[01:39:16.464 --> 01:39:20.946]  I've got a lot of hope, but I'm glad to hear that we're kindred spirits on that issue.
[01:39:21.546 --> 01:39:23.447]  I was grieving.
[01:39:23.467 --> 01:39:25.508]  I saw my parents Saturday night for dinner.
[01:39:25.608 --> 01:39:27.269]  They were totally freaked out and grieving.
[01:39:28.310 --> 01:39:30.571]  Because my dad is in business and consulting.
[01:39:30.611 --> 01:39:31.412]  He went and read the bill.
[01:39:31.452 --> 01:39:33.613]  He reads a lot of agreements and contracts.
[01:39:33.633 --> 01:39:35.574]  He said, yeah, it's just as bad as you say.
[01:39:35.934 --> 01:39:37.075]  He said, I can't believe it.
[01:39:38.055 --> 01:39:41.197]  Everybody I know who's informed is totally freaked out.
[01:39:41.217 --> 01:39:48.281]  We knew it was coming, but to have Congress certify it that way, 100-1 in the final vote on Friday in the Senate.
[01:39:48.781 --> 01:39:51.263]  I mean, that lets us know everything we said is true.
[01:39:51.343 --> 01:39:52.444]  It's worse than what we said.
[01:39:52.744 --> 01:39:54.446]  You know, we always knew we were right, Mike.
[01:39:54.686 --> 01:39:57.468]  But at the same time, it's just a habit totally confirmed.
[01:39:57.528 --> 01:39:58.449]  It's just horrible.
[01:39:58.830 --> 01:40:00.051]  I wanted to be proven wrong.
[01:40:00.771 --> 01:40:02.352]  Yeah, so did I. Absolutely.
[01:40:02.593 --> 01:40:05.895]  I wanted to wake up in the morning and find out, oh, it had all been, you know, a mistake.
[01:40:05.915 --> 01:40:10.839]  And I could, you know, quit the website and go back to just doing what it is I want to do and not have to deal with it anymore.
[01:40:10.859 --> 01:40:11.800]  But it is very real.
[01:40:12.221 --> 01:40:13.081]  It has happened.
[01:40:13.462 --> 01:40:15.323]  We can't even say now it's going to happen.
[01:40:15.423 --> 01:40:16.164]  It has happened.
[01:40:16.224 --> 01:40:16.764]  It is here.
[01:40:16.924 --> 01:40:17.445]  It is real.
[01:40:18.560 --> 01:40:31.665]  And, you know, I'm hoping that the rest of America will simply say, okay, this is as far as we're going to go, and it is time to, like, start dealing with what America needs right now instead of all these foreign countries' interests and agendas.
[01:40:31.865 --> 01:40:33.546]  Let's talk about Iran, and we'll go to calls.
[01:40:34.146 --> 01:40:37.367]  Obviously, North Korea is threatening to test a nuke to get some funding.
[01:40:39.008 --> 01:40:40.348]  But our government doesn't care about that.
[01:40:40.608 --> 01:40:42.049]  I'm not saying attack North Korea.
[01:40:42.089 --> 01:40:45.670]  My point is that they want to attack Iran when they've done nothing but roll over.
[01:40:46.505 --> 01:40:47.326]  Which is what they've done.
[01:40:47.706 --> 01:40:50.790]  Syria is torturing whoever our government says they're being threatened.
[01:40:51.390 --> 01:40:52.992]  But North Korea is threatening to test nukes.
[01:40:53.332 --> 01:40:54.814]  They've got the carrier groups there.
[01:40:55.774 --> 01:40:58.995]  We're sending another carrier group of submarines there with cruise missiles.
[01:40:59.516 --> 01:41:01.617]  They're openly saying they may preemptively nuke them.
[01:41:01.637 --> 01:41:03.317]  They're telling the military to get ready to hit them.
[01:41:03.657 --> 01:41:05.098]  It's gone now to operational.
[01:41:05.398 --> 01:41:11.581]  They're now not just Cy Hirsch at the New Yorker, but top generals are bragging that military operations are ongoing.
[01:41:11.881 --> 01:41:14.542]  We know there's been bombings every few weeks in Iran.
[01:41:14.722 --> 01:41:16.683]  Our criminal government is attacking them.
[01:41:16.703 --> 01:41:17.703]  They're still taking it.
[01:41:18.124 --> 01:41:18.984]  What do you see happening?
[01:41:20.220 --> 01:41:40.637]  Well, the first thing I'm seeing right now is that our government is continuing to factionalize, and not everybody is in agreement with pursuing this war in Iran, because even if Bush uses the nuclear option against some of the key targets, the conventional wisdom that I'm hearing from military sources is that the U.S.
[01:41:40.697 --> 01:41:43.059]  is not going to win a land war in Iran.
[01:41:43.780 --> 01:41:46.042]  Well, we're going to lose the global publicity, too.
[01:41:46.062 --> 01:41:47.523]  We're going to lose that right.
[01:41:47.563 --> 01:41:48.264]  Yeah, we absolutely are.
[01:41:49.475 --> 01:42:02.067]  And so, a lot of people are seeing invading Iran as a huge, huge, huge mistake, and that Bush is continuing to push this, primarily because he doesn't want to look like he's backing down, especially for the election.
[01:42:02.608 --> 01:42:04.630]  Well, to pause his scheme, he's desperate.
[01:42:04.650 --> 01:42:06.812]  Sorry, go ahead.
[01:42:07.373 --> 01:42:12.037]  Yeah, he's under huge pressure from Israel to continue to pursue these wars.
[01:42:12.097 --> 01:42:13.879]  And we know they're blackmailing the White House.
[01:42:14.577 --> 01:42:23.127]  Yeah, absolutely, and unfortunately, you know, Bush may yield to that blackmail and commit a mistake from which this country is never going to recover.
[01:42:23.208 --> 01:42:24.549]  What is wrong with Israel?
[01:42:24.589 --> 01:42:30.236]  Do they just have the worst hubris or chutzpah ever seen in the galaxy?
[01:42:30.296 --> 01:42:31.518]  I mean, it's crazy.
[01:42:33.513 --> 01:42:33.813]  It is.
[01:42:34.514 --> 01:42:37.536]  It's incredible amounts of arrogance and fanaticism.
[01:42:37.556 --> 01:42:48.025]  I mean, if you look at the way they run their own country, contrary to the claims that they are a democracy, their country is just an absolute mess.
[01:42:48.145 --> 01:42:57.192]  My personal opinion is that Israel as a social experiment has just utterly failed because the rationale for Israel was an independent state for the protection of the Jewish people.
[01:42:57.563 --> 01:43:02.406]  And yet everything Israel's government has been doing makes the world more dangerous for Jewish people.
[01:43:03.187 --> 01:43:12.433]  They require so much money to be poured in, four times the entire cost of the Apollo Moon program from the American taxpayers so far, which means they're not independent in anything, not when they need that.
[01:43:12.453 --> 01:43:14.414]  Well, I disagree with you, Mike Rivero.
[01:43:14.494 --> 01:43:16.015]  It's much more than four times.
[01:43:16.055 --> 01:43:20.378]  That's just the public stuff, and they give them all the arms and do the lend-lease stuff.
[01:43:20.398 --> 01:43:21.859]  There's all sorts of payoffs.
[01:43:23.358 --> 01:43:45.049]  Absolutely, and it's propping up this country, and yet most of the Jewish people I know, while they say, rah-rah Israel, they themselves don't want to live there because the quality of life there and the safety issues, it's really all wrapped up in this mythological, religious, idealistic view, and the reality on the ground just does not match that at all.
[01:43:45.829 --> 01:43:48.791]  And yes, if you look at the mass of Israel since its inception...
[01:43:49.441 --> 01:43:55.304]  The point is, before 1947, there were Jews all over Palestine and the Arabic countries and the Muslim countries, and they were honored and loved and respected.
[01:43:55.344 --> 01:43:56.025]  Everybody got along.
[01:43:56.045 --> 01:43:57.025]  Now it's the complete opposite.
[01:44:19.338 --> 01:44:20.258]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:44:20.839 --> 01:44:32.624]  And unfortunately, you know, it is the average person on the street, Arab, Jewish, whatever, Christian, who are paying the price for all of this extreme polarized nationalism that we're seeing.
[01:44:32.644 --> 01:44:34.004]  So what do you see happening with Iran?
[01:44:36.685 --> 01:44:39.587]  To get back to Iran, I suspect that the U.S.
[01:44:39.647 --> 01:44:47.610]  will in fact conduct an attack possibly just prior to the election to try and distract away from the Foley situation.
[01:44:48.663 --> 01:44:52.305]  But how are they going to trigger that?
[01:44:53.266 --> 01:44:55.187]  I don't see us as able to win a war in Iran.
[01:44:55.387 --> 01:44:58.909]  Well, I don't either, but they can win the propaganda war here domestically.
[01:44:58.929 --> 01:45:01.250]  It doesn't matter if it's lost internationally.
[01:45:01.270 --> 01:45:04.372]  It doesn't matter if reality is the opposite of what the government says.
[01:45:04.712 --> 01:45:10.756]  They know the people will rally around briefly around the Fuhrer if we're in some type of military action.
[01:45:11.972 --> 01:45:24.377]  Well, that has been the historical precedent, but if you look back at the poll number charts over the last several years, you will see that with each one of these new events that Bush has been doing, the poll bounce that he gets from it has been less and less and less.
[01:45:24.398 --> 01:45:24.678]  That's right.
[01:45:24.818 --> 01:45:30.400]  And I think they've gone to this well a few too many times, and it's really starting to come up dry.
[01:45:30.940 --> 01:45:33.642]  So I don't know how much of a bump they're going to get going into Iran.
[01:45:33.722 --> 01:45:34.442]  No, I agree.
[01:45:34.562 --> 01:45:36.383]  It's like a narcotics graph.
[01:45:36.443 --> 01:45:39.104]  It just takes more and more for lesser and less effect.
[01:45:39.850 --> 01:45:40.791]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:45:41.191 --> 01:45:49.840]  And especially with Iraq, our military is already preparing emergency evacuation plans to get out of Iraq the same way we got out of Vietnam.
[01:45:50.321 --> 01:45:56.567]  So I think going into Iran is an extraordinarily reckless move, and it's going to be seen as an extraordinarily reckless move.
[01:45:57.000 --> 01:46:06.669]  And with most Americans now aware that Bush lied for the reasons to go into Iraq, I don't think he's going to get much push for his explanations about why we have to go into Iran.
[01:46:07.049 --> 01:46:07.289]  I agree.
[01:46:07.309 --> 01:46:08.751]  We're going to go to calls in about a minute and a half.
[01:46:08.791 --> 01:46:19.881]  But first, here's Rush Limbaugh spinning torture, which at the time he was saying this, it was all over the news, that it included beating people to death and raping women and children.
[01:46:20.321 --> 01:46:21.382]  This is what he had to say about it.
[01:46:22.349 --> 01:46:24.050]  It's psychologically wrong with that.
[01:46:24.470 --> 01:46:25.551]  It's not the act so much.
[01:46:25.571 --> 01:46:31.974]  It was like a college fraternity prank to stack up naked... Exactly!
[01:46:32.375 --> 01:46:33.975]  Exactly my point!
[01:46:34.276 --> 01:46:45.142]  This is no different to what happens at the Skull and Bones initiation, and we're going to ruin people's lives over it, and we're going to hamper our military effort, and then we are going to really hammer them because they had a good time.
[01:46:46.963 --> 01:46:47.203]  You know...
[01:46:48.206 --> 01:46:50.327]  These people are being fired at every day.
[01:46:50.407 --> 01:46:51.827]  I'm talking about people having a good time.
[01:46:52.147 --> 01:46:54.628]  These people... You ever heard of emotional release?
[01:46:55.688 --> 01:46:57.629]  You ever heard of me to blow some steam off?
[01:46:58.869 --> 01:47:01.130]  With acid poured into orifices.
[01:47:01.190 --> 01:47:02.551]  Yeah, that's... No, no, no.
[01:47:02.631 --> 01:47:08.313]  Limbaugh, the official Pentagon plan was to balkanize and break the country up and create civil war.
[01:47:08.353 --> 01:47:09.493]  They may have overdone it now.
[01:47:10.579 --> 01:47:15.420]  To be able to stay there for decades, and so this actually gets the troops killed.
[01:47:15.440 --> 01:47:19.401]  You know, Tony Snow spins it that, oh, we're just trying to stabilize Iraq.
[01:47:19.421 --> 01:47:19.881]  No, no, no, no.
[01:47:20.301 --> 01:47:25.863]  The President's plan is working to a certain extent, but it may be working too well, as you just said.
[01:47:25.883 --> 01:47:30.984]  They're having to now plan evacuation plans, and so they need to escalate it to the next level.
[01:47:31.364 --> 01:47:35.465]  Now, speaking of perversion and torture and bizarre activities...
[01:47:35.925 --> 01:47:38.846]  But these neocons are universally involved in the evidence shows.
[01:47:39.146 --> 01:47:40.807]  Here's Tony Snow on CNN.
[01:47:41.247 --> 01:47:49.769]  The reporter brings up the Foley scandal, and this is what the White House propagandist has to say.
[01:47:50.390 --> 01:47:53.110]  Your point, which is that it's not always a rosy scenario.
[01:47:53.150 --> 01:48:04.254]  What he's talking about is an area, if you have democracy flourishing in Iraq, where you have Syria on one side and Iran on the other,
[01:48:04.801 --> 01:48:06.302]  Both of which would be threatened by that.
[01:48:06.342 --> 01:48:13.644]  If you have Iraq and Afghanistan on both sides of Iran, practicing democracy, it does send a powerful message.
[01:48:13.664 --> 01:48:19.867]  And you have seen what the President was talking about, is the democratic ripples that have begun to manifest themselves in the Middle East.
[01:48:20.007 --> 01:48:21.387]  And that is a game changer.
[01:48:21.487 --> 01:48:25.849]  And my original question went back to a memo that he received one month earlier that called it
[01:48:26.289 --> 01:48:28.650]  A failed state of constant violence.
[01:48:28.690 --> 01:48:39.693]  I'm just saying that when there are charges that the American people were not necessarily given the full story, this speech sort of goes ahead and confirms what Bob Woodward seems to be saying.
[01:48:39.753 --> 01:48:40.533]  No, not really.
[01:48:40.593 --> 01:48:47.876]  Because, again, if you go back and start looking through the speeches, for instance, the ones that have been given in the last month, he has always talked about the difficulty of the task.
[01:48:47.896 --> 01:48:50.456]  Well, certainly in the last month I would completely agree with you.
[01:48:50.516 --> 01:48:51.077]  Absolutely.
[01:48:51.117 --> 01:48:53.517]  In the last month we have certainly heard that from the President.
[01:48:53.577 --> 01:48:55.858]  Many people have said, yeah, now the President...
[01:48:56.698 --> 01:49:04.140]  I do want to talk a little bit about Congressman Mark Foley, which is our other prong, so if we can shift, I'd love to move on.
[01:49:04.721 --> 01:49:06.301]  There's lots to talk about there as well.
[01:49:06.761 --> 01:49:20.686]  There's an investigation, as you well know, but my question would be, why is Representative Hastert, when he was aware that there were over-friendly emails between a congressman and a 16-year-old page, why so slow to move to an investigation?
[01:49:20.726 --> 01:49:23.907]  You're going to have to ask the Speaker about that stuff.
[01:49:23.987 --> 01:49:25.027]  Our plate's full enough.
[01:49:26.187 --> 01:49:29.088]  This is a terrible story, and as a solo dad, I've got three kids.
[01:49:29.768 --> 01:49:42.810]  I think it's absolutely incumbent on members of Congress, many of whom have the charge of young pages, to make sure that these kids can come and get a good experience in Washington and not have to worry about the sort of things that have been alleged here.
[01:49:43.650 --> 01:49:49.991]  My sense is, figure out what the facts are, figure out who knew what when, let the House go ahead and conduct its investigations and others do it.
[01:49:50.011 --> 01:49:53.992]  We're going to find out the facts, and I think probably sooner or later, because people do want to know.
[01:49:54.532 --> 01:49:57.056]  I would assume everybody would want to know, including the President.
[01:49:57.096 --> 01:49:58.938]  I mean, we're not talking about any old person.
[01:49:58.978 --> 01:50:02.743]  We're talking about the leadership of a Republican in Congress.
[01:50:02.863 --> 01:50:05.726]  Why would he not hear something that's disturbing or his office?
[01:50:06.287 --> 01:50:06.968]  Over-friendly.
[01:50:07.008 --> 01:50:11.073]  When I see that word as a parent, and I think any parent would say, whoa, over-friendly?
[01:50:11.233 --> 01:50:12.575]  Any communication between a 16-year-old?
[01:50:13.616 --> 01:50:27.147]  Yeah, look, I hate to tell you, but it's not always pretty up there on Capitol Hill, and there have been other scandals, as you know, that have been more than simply naughty emails.
[01:50:28.348 --> 01:50:31.811]  Look, again, I'll reiterate my point.
[01:50:32.852 --> 01:50:33.893]  We had it queued up somewhere else.
[01:50:33.933 --> 01:50:37.416]  We heard about a minute of Iraq news, but two separate issues.
[01:50:37.456 --> 01:50:38.537]  But notice, naughty.
[01:50:39.780 --> 01:50:43.383]  I mean, he's there talking about... I'm not going to read the emails on there, folks.
[01:50:43.403 --> 01:50:44.865]  He's soliciting him for sex.
[01:50:45.765 --> 01:50:49.108]  And then now he just spun it as naughty, Mike.
[01:50:50.850 --> 01:50:52.731]  It's more than naughty.
[01:50:52.912 --> 01:50:55.234]  It's definitely more than... It's very inappropriate.
[01:50:56.535 --> 01:50:58.456]  Well, hell, it's more than inappropriate.
[01:50:58.536 --> 01:51:01.239]  I mean, that guy's a pervert.
[01:51:02.540 --> 01:51:03.361]  He's a pervert.
[01:51:03.401 --> 01:51:05.562]  We'll be right back with Michael Rivero on your calls.
[01:51:05.623 --> 01:51:06.123]  I promise you.
[01:51:12.239 --> 01:51:15.422]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[01:51:15.762 --> 01:51:17.664]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[01:51:18.064 --> 01:51:25.730]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:51:26.411 --> 01:51:33.436]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:51:33.856 --> 01:51:36.779]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran.
[01:51:37.179 --> 01:51:39.501]  A White House program to disseminate fake news.
[01:51:39.921 --> 01:51:40.742]  NSA spies.
[01:51:42.153 --> 01:51:45.274]  The latest 9-11 information and much, much more.
[01:51:45.574 --> 01:51:49.096]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:51:49.556 --> 01:51:51.457]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:51:51.798 --> 01:51:55.700]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:52:08.832 --> 01:52:17.076]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[01:52:17.336 --> 01:52:21.697]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[01:52:21.978 --> 01:52:30.901]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[01:52:31.101 --> 01:52:34.723]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[01:52:35.023 --> 01:52:40.048]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[01:52:40.349 --> 01:52:47.036]  Hospitals, restaurants and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria.
[01:52:47.549 --> 01:52:48.210]  What about you?

[01:54:16.263 --> 01:54:19.004]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:55:21.069 --> 01:55:22.075]  We're good to go.
[01:55:39.932 --> 01:55:41.593]  I'll send an S.O.S.
[01:55:41.633 --> 01:55:44.736]  to the world I'll send an S.O.S.
[01:55:44.756 --> 01:55:58.167]  to the world I hope that someone gets my I hope that someone gets my I hope that someone gets my Message in the box of your heart
[01:56:11.184 --> 01:56:11.924]  Okay, folks.
[01:56:12.484 --> 01:56:19.147]  We're back live, and if they'll cut their microphone and put me back on air with our guests, we will continue with the broadcast.
[01:56:19.327 --> 01:56:21.568]  I'm down here in Austin, Texas, and they're up in Minnesota.
[01:56:22.029 --> 01:56:24.930]  And once a month or so this happens where we have a connection problem.
[01:56:25.290 --> 01:56:26.971]  We're back on with Michael Rivero.
[01:56:28.091 --> 01:56:30.012]  And, Mike, there's so many other issues.
[01:56:30.032 --> 01:56:31.193]  You know, I always want to take calls.
[01:56:31.213 --> 01:56:34.174]  Sometimes I think, you know, maybe I just should stop taking calls, period, on this show.
[01:56:35.304 --> 01:56:41.250]  But, you know, I like taking them at the same time, but then I don't like cramming them in, and people get frustrated there's not enough time for them.
[01:56:41.270 --> 01:56:42.832]  So maybe we'll just cancel calls today.
[01:56:43.833 --> 01:56:50.800]  But, Michael, where do you, I mean, I asked this earlier, but I want to get more of your view on this.
[01:56:50.860 --> 01:56:57.146]  Where do you see things going in the future, and what are ideas you have for solutions?
[01:56:59.418 --> 01:57:01.419]  Well, I assume you mean domestically.
[01:57:02.160 --> 01:57:28.978]  And unfortunately, I think the writing is very much on the wall that left to their own devices, Bush and his neocon supporters are going to continue to push the country into ever more firm dictatorship where all the power resides with the choice few at the very top and everybody else is pretty much left without any choices about what they will do, what taxes they will pay, what wars they will fight in.
[01:57:30.868 --> 01:57:47.554]  Some time ago, I put up a comment when we were just starting to crank up these wars in the Middle East based on all these lies, that if we did not choose to fight against these rulers right now, that we would soon have no choice but to fight for them from now on.
[01:57:47.894 --> 01:57:50.295]  And we are rapidly approaching that point.
[01:57:50.971 --> 01:57:55.453]  Where the American people will lose the power to say no to what the government is doing.
[01:57:56.113 --> 01:58:00.894]  And once you do that, once you lose the ability to say no, then you are a slave.
[01:58:00.974 --> 01:58:03.635]  No matter how much you're told you're free, you are a slave.
[01:58:03.715 --> 01:58:06.556]  Because there is no freedom without the freedom to say no.
[01:58:07.477 --> 01:58:14.179]  And we need to start saying no to the various lies we are being told about Iraq and Iran's weapons of mass destruction.
[01:58:14.679 --> 01:58:20.221]  We need to say no to sending our loved ones off to fight more wars based on those lies.
[01:58:21.122 --> 01:58:24.283]  We need to say no to the loss of our civil rights.
[01:58:24.663 --> 01:58:26.024]  We need to say no to torture.
[01:58:26.484 --> 01:58:37.508]  We need to say no to a political leadership that views itself as entitled to live the kind of debauched, perverted lifestyle that they so readily condemn and everybody else around them.
[01:58:37.928 --> 01:58:43.129]  And the American people need to start saying no to the government at any and all levels.
[01:58:43.710 --> 01:58:46.251]  Michael Rivero, do five more minutes with us on the other side.
[01:58:46.271 --> 01:58:47.491]  I want you to be able to finish your thought.
[01:58:49.338 --> 01:58:53.239]  If you would like a copy of this show, come to GCNlive.com and reserve it today.
[01:58:53.259 --> 01:58:54.400]  Or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[01:58:54.440 --> 01:58:54.920]  Big Brother.
[01:58:55.100 --> 01:58:55.960]  Mainstream media.
[01:58:55.980 --> 01:58:59.481]  Government cover-ups.
[01:59:00.602 --> 01:59:03.763]  You want answers?
[01:59:11.758 --> 01:59:12.618]  Well, so does he.
[01:59:12.638 --> 01:59:16.920]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:59:17.480 --> 01:59:21.621]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:59:36.366 --> 01:59:38.767]  Yeah, I've got another really important guest coming on.
[01:59:38.807 --> 01:59:39.987]  She is a law professor.
[01:59:40.859 --> 01:59:43.721]  Just coming on for one segment.
[01:59:43.741 --> 01:59:47.544]  I like taking your calls, but we like to also have these guests on with their perspective.
[01:59:48.145 --> 01:59:58.273]  Then I get frustrated because I don't like to have to hurry through your calls, but we'll try to hurry through a few right now for Jeff and Chris and John and Harry or Henry, who have been holding the longest.
[01:59:59.514 --> 02:00:03.157]  But it's not my fault that we can't spend a lot of time with you.
[02:00:03.337 --> 02:00:07.981]  If folks complain, we'll just stop taking calls entirely, except on days when we do take calls.
[02:00:08.862 --> 02:00:10.423]  Then we can have days where we take calls.
[02:00:11.256 --> 02:00:13.157]  For me, this is not an enjoyment.
[02:00:13.197 --> 02:00:14.618]  This is not an ego show.
[02:00:15.239 --> 02:00:17.500]  My life's basically been ruined by the New World Order.
[02:00:17.900 --> 02:00:19.141]  I don't enjoy doing this.
[02:00:19.161 --> 02:00:20.822]  This is a war, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:00:21.383 --> 02:00:22.123]  This is a war.
[02:00:22.203 --> 02:00:23.724]  This is about getting the information out.
[02:00:24.324 --> 02:00:26.466]  And we know what we're talking about here on this broadcast.
[02:00:26.846 --> 02:00:27.726]  This is what we do.
[02:00:27.987 --> 02:00:29.227]  This is how we live our lives.
[02:00:29.828 --> 02:00:33.230]  And I salute Michael Rivero and others that are out there fighting this tyranny.
[02:00:34.131 --> 02:00:39.053]  Mike, do you ever just get mad at the government and the criminals that run it because you just want to live your life?
[02:00:39.073 --> 02:00:40.353]  Because that's really the feeling I have.
[02:00:40.733 --> 02:00:42.594]  I've just gotten so sick of these people.
[02:00:43.734 --> 02:00:47.235]  I get sick of fighting them at the same time, but I know I've got to fight that much harder.
[02:00:48.315 --> 02:00:50.476]  Yeah, absolutely in agreement.
[02:00:51.476 --> 02:01:03.020]  Like you, my life has been seriously altered by my political involvement, and I really got started almost entirely by accident, and the effects on my life since that time have been
[02:01:03.769 --> 02:01:10.513]  Rather severe, and sometimes I wonder what would have my life been like had I just kept my mouth shut all those years ago.
[02:01:11.654 --> 02:01:12.774]  But, of course, too late.
[02:01:13.134 --> 02:01:13.975]  I can't go back.
[02:01:14.355 --> 02:01:31.305]  Yes, I get very angry with the government, and I get angry with the government because I was raised to view this country in a certain light, to value certain ideals, truth and honesty highest among them, and to see this government routinely, arrogantly,
[02:01:32.055 --> 02:01:35.737]  Yeah, right before 9-11, we had the dead intern, or Bones, there in the D.C.
[02:01:35.777 --> 02:01:35.977]  park.
[02:02:00.982 --> 02:02:02.383]  And then that just disappeared.
[02:02:02.403 --> 02:02:10.069]  Do you think this new sex scandal will, because now involving more pages and all the rest of it, do you think this will just evaporate too?
[02:02:11.390 --> 02:02:12.771]  No, I don't.
[02:02:13.832 --> 02:02:22.718]  I'm in agreement that the Gary Condit scandal was designed to keep the American media and the people distracted because in early 2001, the U.S.
[02:02:22.758 --> 02:02:27.582]  government was announcing to other countries that there was a plan to invade Afghanistan
[02:02:28.187 --> 02:02:36.892]  In October of 2001, and of course 9-11 happened exactly when the US government needed an incident to anger the American people to support a war.
[02:02:37.673 --> 02:02:45.978]  In this case, however, I wondered at first if this might be another distraction, but the damage that's being inflicted onto the incumbent...
[02:02:48.318 --> 02:02:53.421]  The damage is so great, I don't think so.
[02:02:54.422 --> 02:03:10.551]  We are beginning to see reports surface that the leaks of these incriminating emails and text messages are coming actually from dissident elements within the Department of Justice and the FBI, who have just decided that this whole circus has got to come to an end.
[02:03:11.019 --> 02:03:11.920]  No, I tend to agree with you.
[02:03:11.940 --> 02:03:14.181]  I mean, I tend to agree with you.
[02:03:14.201 --> 02:03:17.723]  I mean, it's just more dirty pool between the two, you know, grips that are within the same...
[02:03:29.735 --> 02:03:34.038]  I just can't believe how much danger our entire civilization is in.
[02:03:34.438 --> 02:03:37.780]  Michael Rivero, thank you for spending time with us today.
[02:03:37.800 --> 02:03:40.401]  It's always great to have you visit us once a month.
[02:03:40.441 --> 02:03:45.324]  We always watch your great work over at WhatReallyHappened.com, and we'll talk to you soon, my friend.
[02:03:45.344 --> 02:03:46.745]  Talk to you next month.
[02:03:46.925 --> 02:03:47.225]  You bet.
[02:03:47.245 --> 02:03:47.845]  Thanks for the time.
[02:03:48.266 --> 02:03:53.589]  Okay, I keep intending to go to the calls, but we had that technical problem at the end of the last hour.
[02:03:55.772 --> 02:03:57.934]  We'll try to get to them coming up here in a moment.
[02:03:57.974 --> 02:04:00.596]  We have this other guest, but we'll see what happens.
[02:04:04.219 --> 02:04:07.402]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[02:04:07.742 --> 02:04:09.644]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[02:04:10.044 --> 02:04:17.631]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:04:18.393 --> 02:04:25.419]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:04:25.819 --> 02:04:37.248]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:04:37.568 --> 02:04:41.091]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:04:41.531 --> 02:04:43.453]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:04:43.793 --> 02:04:47.636]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:05:00.993 --> 02:05:02.834]  Dad, can we stop?
[02:05:03.174 --> 02:05:04.695]  We need to go to the bathroom.
[02:05:05.115 --> 02:05:05.375]  What?
[02:05:05.715 --> 02:05:06.075]  Again?
[02:05:06.495 --> 02:05:08.136]  We just stopped two hours ago.
[02:05:08.196 --> 02:05:12.618]  Honey, let's stop, because I gave the kids their Spark Berkey water bottles.
[02:05:12.858 --> 02:05:14.139]  Why did you do that?
[02:05:14.359 --> 02:05:20.161]  Because they can't drink and talk at the same time, and that way we don't have to listen to them singing, Are we there yet?
[02:05:20.441 --> 02:05:21.482]  Are we there yet?
[02:05:21.582 --> 02:05:22.662]  for the entire trip.
[02:05:22.902 --> 02:05:25.103]  Hmm, I didn't think about that.
[02:05:25.583 --> 02:05:26.604]  Great idea.
[02:05:26.884 --> 02:05:29.465]  Yeah, and it's cheap entertainment for the kids.
[02:05:29.805 --> 02:05:36.870]  Bottled water costs around 75 cents a bottle, and using our Berkey Sport bottles, it costs us less than two and a half cents per refill.
[02:05:37.151 --> 02:05:37.471]  Honey?
[02:05:38.294 --> 02:05:39.535]  You're terrific!
[02:05:39.915 --> 02:05:41.436]  Oh, honey, so are you.
[02:05:41.536 --> 02:05:44.937]  You're the one that bought the family our sport Berkey water bottles.
[02:05:45.217 --> 02:05:45.998]  Now can we stop?
[02:05:46.498 --> 02:05:47.238]  I need to go, too.
[02:05:47.539 --> 02:05:51.981]  Get your Berkey Sport Purification Bottle for only $39 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:05:52.041 --> 02:05:52.221]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:05:52.281 --> 02:05:53.542]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[02:06:01.184 --> 02:06:03.665]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network.
[02:06:03.786 --> 02:06:06.147]  I have an urgent message for all of our listeners.
[02:06:06.207 --> 02:06:12.391]  The mass media keeps telling us that we are the richest, most powerful economy in the world.
[02:06:13.871 --> 02:06:16.173]  If this is true, why can't we pay our bills?
[02:06:16.833 --> 02:06:20.375]  Why is the United States the world's largest debtor nation?
[02:06:20.915 --> 02:06:25.058]  The truth is that we are in the worst debt bubble in our nation's history.
[02:06:25.638 --> 02:06:28.580]  When the bubble bursts, will you be able to feed your family?
[02:06:29.562 --> 02:06:32.503]  When the inevitable crash occurs, will you be ready?
[02:06:33.223 --> 02:06:39.225]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.
[02:06:39.485 --> 02:06:42.306]  That's 1-888-892-6238.
[02:06:42.546 --> 02:06:47.128]  For the following two free reports, U.S.
[02:06:47.228 --> 02:06:50.129]  Debt Bubble, Red Alert, and Real Estate Crash.
[02:06:51.089 --> 02:06:53.390]  Call 888-8XANADU.
[02:06:53.450 --> 02:06:57.631]  That's 888-8XANADU.
[02:06:57.972 --> 02:06:58.932]  And ask for George.
[02:07:00.948 --> 02:07:05.971]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:07:06.351 --> 02:07:08.632]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:07:33.666 --> 02:07:40.392]  We're good to go.
[02:07:58.628 --> 02:08:05.730]  All right, my friends, we are now into the third and final hour, and we're honored to have our next guest join us.
[02:08:05.870 --> 02:08:13.473]  She's Marjorie Cohn, professor of law at Santa Clara University School of Law, and she has a long and distinguished bio.
[02:08:13.513 --> 02:08:17.695]  She's been all over every major TV network and station and
[02:08:18.613 --> 02:08:21.975]  National NPR, major newspaper.
[02:08:22.055 --> 02:08:29.858]  She is quite an expert on the law and is frequently interfaced with by the press.
[02:08:29.898 --> 02:08:32.699]  And we're honored to have her on with us for just this one segment.
[02:08:32.739 --> 02:08:36.601]  And I promise I'll get to all your calls for those that have been holding for an hour plus.
[02:08:37.261 --> 02:08:41.023]  We don't normally make callers hold that long, but we've had a lot of information we've covered today.
[02:08:42.344 --> 02:08:45.685]  The article she wrote is a constitutional shredding rounding up U.S.
[02:08:45.725 --> 02:08:46.145]  citizens.
[02:08:46.165 --> 02:08:47.066]  And I've read the bill.
[02:08:47.805 --> 02:08:48.245]  We're good to go.
[02:08:48.285 --> 02:08:48.926]  We're good to go.
[02:09:05.999 --> 02:09:08.560]  You see, you're guilty until proven innocent by a kangaroo court.
[02:09:09.041 --> 02:09:10.841]  And then, of course, the White House also has immunity.
[02:09:11.182 --> 02:09:13.163]  They make you an enemy combatant.
[02:09:13.183 --> 02:09:14.363]  So it's kind of a play on words.
[02:09:14.383 --> 02:09:15.824]  They go, oh, this doesn't affect U.S.
[02:09:15.904 --> 02:09:18.986]  citizens because they strip you of citizenship when they do it.
[02:09:19.426 --> 02:09:23.508]  And so joining us is the good professor.
[02:09:23.928 --> 02:09:27.350]  And I appreciate you coming on with us, Marjorie Combe.
[02:09:27.370 --> 02:09:27.650]  Thank you.
[02:09:28.257 --> 02:09:29.038]  My pleasure, Alex.
[02:09:29.098 --> 02:09:30.619]  I just want to make a slight correction.
[02:09:30.719 --> 02:09:34.441]  I went to Santa Clara Law School, but I teach at Thomas Jefferson School of Law.
[02:09:34.621 --> 02:09:35.141]  That's right.
[02:09:35.181 --> 02:09:35.361]  Great.
[02:09:35.401 --> 02:09:36.922]  I was just scanning over your bio here.
[02:09:36.962 --> 02:09:38.163]  Well, thank you for coming on with us.
[02:09:38.363 --> 02:09:39.144]  It's my pleasure.
[02:09:39.344 --> 02:09:39.784]  You bet.
[02:09:40.224 --> 02:09:46.488]  Just in the ten minutes we've got left here together, there are some people in denial about this affecting U.S.
[02:09:46.508 --> 02:09:50.250]  citizens because the Bush crime family has been lying about it.
[02:09:50.470 --> 02:09:52.872]  But what's actually in the legislation?
[02:09:53.502 --> 02:09:54.363]  You know, it's interesting.
[02:09:54.403 --> 02:10:06.133]  We didn't hear this in the corporate media, but the definition of unlawful enemy combatants, and somebody who can be locked up indefinitely, is not limited to Al-Qaeda or the Taliban.
[02:10:06.493 --> 02:10:08.215]  It's not even limited to aliens.
[02:10:08.355 --> 02:10:08.935]  It covers U.S.
[02:10:09.436 --> 02:10:10.577]  citizens as well.
[02:10:10.917 --> 02:10:14.280]  It's not limited to people who are captured or detained overseas.
[02:10:14.700 --> 02:10:23.448]  It's not even limited to the armed conflict against Al-Qaeda and the Taliban, and it's not even limited to a time of war it could apply in peacetime.
[02:10:23.748 --> 02:10:25.189]  It's very, very frightening.
[02:10:25.570 --> 02:10:32.876]  It's extremely broad and purposefully vague and mirrors a lot of what we saw in Patriot Act I and the attempted Patriot Act II.
[02:10:33.256 --> 02:10:33.637]  I call it 1.5.
[02:10:34.137 --> 02:10:36.419]  They did pass a few new provisions today.
[02:10:36.699 --> 02:10:38.001]  We're good to go.
[02:10:58.081 --> 02:10:58.782]  And shock!
[02:10:58.822 --> 02:11:08.088]  We knew things were going in the wrong direction for a while, but this is very similar to Hitler's Enabling Act, and I actually feel a type of bone-chilling melancholy.
[02:11:08.668 --> 02:11:10.069]  You know, I agree with you, Alex.
[02:11:10.290 --> 02:11:14.392]  Look at particularly Section 948A1.
[02:11:14.552 --> 02:11:18.995]  That's 948A1 that defines unlawful enemy combatants.
[02:11:19.416 --> 02:11:25.580]  And that's anybody that Bush and Rumsfeld say has purposefully and materially supported hostilities against
[02:11:25.999 --> 02:11:26.259]  I think so.
[02:11:49.791 --> 02:11:51.832]  What if they say you are an alien?
[02:11:52.493 --> 02:11:55.855]  And the aliens don't even have any rights of habeas corpus.
[02:11:55.995 --> 02:11:58.056]  So say they make a mistake and you're really a U.S.
[02:11:58.076 --> 02:12:01.898]  citizen, you're going to rot there for the rest of your life in who knows where.
[02:12:01.918 --> 02:12:07.622]  It could be in one of the secret CIA prisons somewhere in the world with no way at all to prove that you're a U.S.
[02:12:07.662 --> 02:12:08.102]  citizen.
[02:12:10.063 --> 02:12:13.005]  And then Bush played this whole...
[02:12:13.760 --> 02:12:14.501]  We're good to go.
[02:12:30.880 --> 02:12:43.506]  Previously, and then up until the day of the final votes on Friday, they were still claiming that it was a compromise, and still now I'm having arguments with other pundits saying, oh no, this doesn't affect U.S.
[02:12:43.546 --> 02:12:46.828]  citizens, where it clearly affects U.S.
[02:12:46.868 --> 02:12:47.308]  citizens.
[02:12:47.729 --> 02:12:49.109]  It absolutely affects U.S.
[02:12:49.129 --> 02:12:56.413]  citizens, and Yale law professors like Bruce Ackerman, Jack Balkin, several other professors at very top schools,
[02:12:57.083 --> 02:12:59.505]  All agree that it does affect U.S.
[02:12:59.565 --> 02:13:00.025]  citizens.
[02:13:00.185 --> 02:13:08.332]  Now, they can't be tried in the military commissions, and they can't be denied habeas corpus, but there are several provisions that do affect U.S.
[02:13:08.372 --> 02:13:15.437]  citizens, and one of them, and I think the most disturbing part, is that they could declare that you're an unlawful enemy combatant and lock you up.
[02:13:16.005 --> 02:13:18.888]  And it could be indefinitely.
[02:13:18.908 --> 02:13:22.331]  Well, see, that is a violation of habeas corpus.
[02:13:22.391 --> 02:13:25.814]  In fact, my reading of it, if you tie it into the U.S.
[02:13:25.834 --> 02:13:27.795]  Code, is it's even wider than what you just stated.
[02:13:28.296 --> 02:13:40.286]  Well, you know, if you look at the Supreme Court's decision in Hamdi, not Hamden, but Hamdi, they said the President has authority to detain an enemy combatant, and Hamdi was a U.S.
[02:13:40.326 --> 02:13:40.787]  citizen.
[02:13:41.337 --> 02:13:45.339]  But only, only if they were captured in Afghanistan.
[02:13:45.459 --> 02:13:48.661]  But, but... They limited it to Afghanistan, and so we don't know.
[02:13:48.681 --> 02:13:59.086]  You know, Bush pulled this thing with Jose Padilla, the so-called dirty bomber, and of course there was never any evidence that he was a dirty bomber except from someone who had been tortured into saying it.
[02:13:59.946 --> 02:14:02.387]  But Jose Padilla was kept... He's a U.S.
[02:14:02.407 --> 02:14:05.769]  citizen, and he was not captured in Afghanistan the way Hamdi was.
[02:14:06.049 --> 02:14:09.431]  He was captured in Chicago, which is the United States, of course.
[02:14:09.835 --> 02:14:11.397]  And they locked him up for years.
[02:14:11.557 --> 02:14:19.984]  And finally, on the eve of the due date for the government's brief in the Supreme Court to determine whether or not it's constitutional for the president to hold a U.S.
[02:14:20.024 --> 02:14:21.666]  citizen who's been picked up in the U.S.
[02:14:22.006 --> 02:14:26.410]  as an enemy combatant, the Bush administration said, oh, we're going to charge him with a crime.
[02:14:26.931 --> 02:14:27.631]  This is moot.
[02:14:27.872 --> 02:14:30.294]  Well, Professor, I agree, but right here at 950J...
[02:14:32.736 --> 02:14:40.361]  Line 24, no court, justice, or judge shall have any jurisdiction to hear or consider any claim or cause of action whatsoever.
[02:14:40.401 --> 02:14:45.123]  And it goes on, and then we have Gonzalez coming out telling the courts, you stay out of this.
[02:14:46.704 --> 02:14:53.208]  In fact, the San Francisco Chronicle picked up on this on Friday and said he has a new power risen to a level above the courts.
[02:14:53.548 --> 02:14:55.329]  That is official dictatorship.
[02:14:55.962 --> 02:15:00.107]  It is, and yeah, I mean, can you imagine Gonzalez saying, stay out of the courts?
[02:15:00.147 --> 02:15:03.670]  I mean, that's why the Founding Fathers put three branches into the Constitution.
[02:15:03.951 --> 02:15:10.137]  I'll tell you, the Center for Constitutional Rights has already filed a legal challenge to this bill.
[02:15:10.258 --> 02:15:13.501]  But they've got it in law in here that you're not even allowed to do that.
[02:15:13.521 --> 02:15:14.262]  This is...
[02:15:14.642 --> 02:15:18.907]  This is the executive literally declaring the Fuhrer principle.
[02:15:19.168 --> 02:15:20.329]  I mean, folks, we're not joking.
[02:15:20.369 --> 02:15:25.876]  They're openly saying that they are supreme when in truth it's co-equal branches.
[02:15:26.276 --> 02:15:30.201]  That's true, and we'll see whether the courts actually take this test case or not.
[02:15:30.521 --> 02:15:31.863]  But I'll tell you something else.
[02:15:32.503 --> 02:15:33.665]  What Bush has done...
[02:15:34.298 --> 02:15:39.339]  Is to sign every single bill that's come before him, except for the stem cell research bill.
[02:15:39.359 --> 02:15:40.639]  It's the only one he's vetoed.
[02:15:41.159 --> 02:15:53.101]  And he has then quietly attached a little signing statement at the end of over 800 bills, more than all other presidents combined, saying, I'm going to follow those parts of the law that I want to follow.
[02:15:53.161 --> 02:15:55.602]  Basically, giving the finger to Congress.
[02:15:55.962 --> 02:15:57.122]  And that's what we have.
[02:15:57.282 --> 02:16:01.583]  We have what is rapidly becoming a dictatorship in this country.
[02:16:02.851 --> 02:16:05.235]  I've never really been scared.
[02:16:05.295 --> 02:16:06.797]  I know it's dangerous what we're doing.
[02:16:06.817 --> 02:16:09.041]  I know these people are very serious and very corrupt.
[02:16:10.022 --> 02:16:15.290]  But Friday, when this all happened, I was literally staggering around in the middle of the night.
[02:16:15.350 --> 02:16:16.111]  I was waking up.
[02:16:16.131 --> 02:16:17.033]  I couldn't sleep.
[02:16:17.053 --> 02:16:18.395]  I never have trouble sleeping.
[02:16:19.028 --> 02:16:22.410]  I mean, I have a real sense of loss, and I'm grieving.
[02:16:22.931 --> 02:16:26.513]  I mean, even Hitler didn't put stuff like this down on paper.
[02:16:26.573 --> 02:16:29.074]  This is just outrageous.
[02:16:29.355 --> 02:16:30.215]  It's terrible.
[02:16:30.315 --> 02:16:37.960]  And also, keep in mind that Kellogg, Brown & Root, which you probably recognize as a subsidiary of Halliburton Cheney's company,
[02:16:38.502 --> 02:16:45.767]  It's building a huge facility at an undisclosed location to hold tens of thousands of undesirables.
[02:16:45.827 --> 02:16:46.808]  Yeah, that was in the Houston Chronicle.
[02:16:46.828 --> 02:16:48.109]  Who do you think those are going to be?
[02:16:48.129 --> 02:16:49.190]  That was in the Houston Chronicle.
[02:16:49.490 --> 02:16:52.152]  Yeah, yeah, it was, it was, absolutely.
[02:16:52.192 --> 02:16:56.675]  Rex 84, I mean, I've got the Senate hearings where they admit the camps for the American people.
[02:16:57.055 --> 02:17:02.199]  Yeah, this is, well, you probably know, and so am I, but after, during World War II...
[02:17:02.979 --> 02:17:15.268]  Our government locked up not just Japanese, but Japanese Americans and German Americans and Italian Americans, locked them up in concentration camps, many of them held even after the war ended.
[02:17:15.648 --> 02:17:16.849]  And seized their property.
[02:17:17.209 --> 02:17:19.210]  Yeah, and seized their property, absolutely.
[02:17:19.350 --> 02:17:22.192]  And I would not put it past Bush.
[02:17:22.513 --> 02:17:24.194]  He is such a dictator.
[02:17:24.434 --> 02:17:30.378]  He's got almost two more years, which is just horrendous, to declare unlawful enemy combatants.
[02:17:31.158 --> 02:17:36.783]  People like you and me who speak out against his policies, who write articles... Well, he'll do what's popular.
[02:17:36.983 --> 02:17:38.704]  Listen, I totally agree.
[02:17:38.924 --> 02:17:41.026]  Well, I totally agree, but he'll do something popular first.
[02:17:41.046 --> 02:17:44.248]  He'll first just grab Arabs or Muslims or people with brown skin.
[02:17:44.508 --> 02:17:45.149]  But did you hear?
[02:17:45.489 --> 02:17:52.454]  They were charging Greg Powles to BBC and ABC News two weeks ago for going and filming a FEMA camp in Louisiana.
[02:17:52.694 --> 02:17:53.374]  Oh, my gosh.
[02:17:53.434 --> 02:17:55.595]  And so ABC News lawyers got involved.
[02:17:55.635 --> 02:18:02.138]  They, for filming infrastructure under the Patriot Act, he was being charged as a terrorist along with the crew.
[02:18:02.798 --> 02:18:04.259]  That's unbelievable.
[02:18:04.319 --> 02:18:06.640]  I mean, George Palast is one of the greatest patriots.
[02:18:06.940 --> 02:18:20.065]  And I'll tell you, the Patriot Act, as you probably know, creates a crime of domestic terrorism, which includes people who speak out and march and exercise their constitutional rights to dissent against government policies.
[02:18:20.125 --> 02:18:20.725]  So you're right.
[02:18:20.765 --> 02:18:22.286]  It did start with the Patriot Act.
[02:18:22.671 --> 02:18:26.673]  And Congress just said, hey, you know, we're going to give you whatever you want.
[02:18:26.753 --> 02:18:30.375]  Every time you wave the 9-11 flag, we're going to give you what you want.
[02:18:30.395 --> 02:18:31.775]  We're going to give you the Iraq war.
[02:18:32.075 --> 02:18:34.297]  We're going to give you the military commissions bill.
[02:18:34.737 --> 02:18:37.118]  And we've got to call a halt to it in November.
[02:18:37.779 --> 02:18:41.582]  Okay, I want to get you back up sometime for a longer period so we can take some calls.
[02:18:41.842 --> 02:18:44.103]  She's Marjorie Cohn, professor of law.
[02:18:44.123 --> 02:18:47.345]  We've got links to her website up on Infowars.com.
[02:18:47.646 --> 02:18:48.846]  Thank you for your expertise.
[02:18:48.886 --> 02:18:49.507]  I appreciate it.
[02:18:49.887 --> 02:18:50.708]  My pleasure, Alex.
[02:18:51.028 --> 02:18:51.448]  God bless.
[02:18:51.708 --> 02:18:53.670]  All right, we'll come back and write your calls, okay?
[02:18:53.770 --> 02:18:56.291]  I'll go to them and we can stay connected here.
[02:18:56.712 --> 02:18:57.212]  We'll be right back.
[02:19:00.163 --> 02:19:08.407]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[02:19:08.667 --> 02:19:13.028]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[02:19:13.309 --> 02:19:22.232]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[02:19:22.432 --> 02:19:26.074]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[02:19:26.354 --> 02:19:31.400]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[02:19:31.680 --> 02:19:38.408]  Hospitals, restaurants and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria.
[02:19:38.889 --> 02:19:39.430]  What about you?
[02:19:40.189 --> 02:19:45.533]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.
[02:19:45.593 --> 02:19:46.754]  Call now to order at 1-888-803-4438.
[02:19:46.774 --> 02:19:48.655]  Order today and save $14 by calling 1-888-803-4438.
[02:19:59.923 --> 02:20:00.223]  I think.
[02:20:27.483 --> 02:20:28.083]  We're good to go.
[02:21:00.618 --> 02:21:02.960]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:21:03.581 --> 02:21:09.448]  Did you know that the mother of all secret societies, the Illuminati, worships Lucifer, better known as Satan the devil?
[02:21:10.369 --> 02:21:17.097]  Did you know that they are the individuals giving rise to the final world social system described in Revelation chapter 13?
[02:21:18.599 --> 02:21:19.059]  We're good to go.
[02:21:19.079 --> 02:21:19.239]  I think?
[02:21:39.345 --> 02:21:40.786]  Just call our toll-free number 1-800-516-8736.
[02:21:40.806 --> 02:21:42.247]  That's 1-800-516-8736 to request your subscription.
[02:21:42.267 --> 02:21:42.507]  Call now.
[02:21:42.527 --> 02:21:45.629]  Operators are standing by to receive your call.
[02:22:01.722 --> 02:22:03.423]  Hello, this is Amy Bjorklund.
[02:22:03.604 --> 02:22:06.205]  Are you totally satisfied with the nourishment you're getting?
[02:22:06.286 --> 02:22:09.328]  Do you have enough energy to do everything you really want to do?
[02:22:09.568 --> 02:22:13.030]  And are you content to remain in your current state of health indefinitely?
[02:22:13.311 --> 02:22:19.135]  Have you already tried diets, exercise, vitamins, juicing, or the latest greatest nutritional wonder products?
[02:22:19.475 --> 02:22:24.277]  Perhaps those things have grown tiresome and not made you feel and look as well as you'd really like to.
[02:22:24.517 --> 02:22:34.921]  But what if you found from a single source the world's freshest, purest, most complete, whole, live food nourishment that tastes delicious and couldn't be any easier to consume?
[02:22:35.181 --> 02:22:36.482]  Well, you just did.
[02:22:36.842 --> 02:22:37.802]  So don't hesitate.
[02:22:37.902 --> 02:22:41.944]  Take the living energy you've always wanted from your nutrition right now.
[02:22:42.224 --> 02:22:47.706]  Visit truthinexcellence.com, click the Truth in Excellence banner on GCNlive.com,
[02:22:48.486 --> 02:22:51.507]  Or call me, Amy Bjorklund, personally at 805-595-2711.
[02:22:51.528 --> 02:22:51.648]  805-595-2711.
[02:22:51.668 --> 02:23:12.417]  Coming up in the next segment, we'll continue with calls if we have time, and I'll run through some of the other news we haven't covered and recap some of the top stories.
[02:23:18.052 --> 02:23:20.935]  But it's... This song's kind of good for the U.S.
[02:23:20.975 --> 02:23:21.775]  Crank it up for a minute.
[02:23:22.116 --> 02:23:23.257]  It's kind of good for our country.
[02:23:23.577 --> 02:23:25.338]  Here for now, but tomorrow we're gone.
[02:23:25.358 --> 02:23:28.601]  Yeah, the country's gone.
[02:23:29.001 --> 02:23:30.863]  Yeah, so, you know, the country's dead now.
[02:23:30.903 --> 02:23:33.365]  The Constitution's completely abolished.
[02:23:35.007 --> 02:23:36.448]  Maybe we can resurrect the country.
[02:23:36.488 --> 02:23:39.570]  Kind of like we're trying to defibrillate it right now.
[02:23:40.892 --> 02:23:43.914]  We don't have a defibrillator, so we're striking the chest of the country.
[02:23:44.315 --> 02:23:44.695]  Wake up!
[02:23:45.749 --> 02:23:47.030]  We've got to kick-start that heart!
[02:23:47.110 --> 02:23:47.930]  Come on!
[02:23:48.310 --> 02:23:48.970]  America!
[02:23:49.010 --> 02:23:51.311]  All right, let's go ahead and go to your calls.
[02:23:52.652 --> 02:23:53.892]  Jeff in Mass.
[02:23:53.932 --> 02:23:54.673]  Thanks for holding.
[02:23:54.693 --> 02:23:55.553]  You're on the air, Jeff.
[02:23:56.153 --> 02:23:59.194]  Yes, Alex, that guest was good.
[02:23:59.855 --> 02:24:01.675]  Marjorie, she is so good.
[02:24:02.055 --> 02:24:02.556]  And you know what?
[02:24:03.196 --> 02:24:08.638]  I really believe that if we get attacked again, this country is completely up the creek.
[02:24:08.998 --> 02:24:09.839]  Because guess what?
[02:24:10.199 --> 02:24:13.600]  They will label Christians and Orthodox Jews as terrorists.
[02:24:14.099 --> 02:24:14.739]  Insurgents.
[02:24:15.060 --> 02:24:16.581]  And strip our citizenship away.
[02:24:17.841 --> 02:24:19.722]  Well, that's what the bill clearly says.
[02:24:19.802 --> 02:24:24.745]  It's basically anybody with property, anybody who criticizes... See, they're the rogue government.
[02:24:24.845 --> 02:24:32.010]  They've hijacked, they've usurped, they've overthrown the country, and they're telling us that we now can't stand up against them or we're terrorists.
[02:24:32.170 --> 02:24:33.691]  Because they are the terrorists.
[02:24:33.711 --> 02:24:34.171]  Go ahead.
[02:24:34.531 --> 02:24:34.871]  Oh, yes.
[02:24:35.131 --> 02:24:39.234]  And what I'm afraid of is they'll use the tool of foreign troops...
[02:24:39.910 --> 02:24:42.915]  As their hammer to suppress American citizens.
[02:24:42.935 --> 02:24:47.983]  Twenty-some percent of the troops in Iraq are illegal alien Mexicans who got legalized to join the military.
[02:24:48.364 --> 02:24:49.646]  They already have foreign troops.
[02:24:50.166 --> 02:24:51.208]  Well, that's it.
[02:24:51.569 --> 02:24:53.512]  But I'm talking about in this country...
[02:24:54.279 --> 02:25:02.945]  Under the auspices of the UN, because you know and I know that foreign troops... Under the North American Union Agreement, well, NORAD's merging with Mexico.
[02:25:03.005 --> 02:25:10.390]  I have that AP article today, official NORAD release, and they say Mexican and Canadian troops will patrol the streets of America.
[02:25:10.690 --> 02:25:11.671]  That is mainstream news.
[02:25:12.051 --> 02:25:14.293]  Oh, yeah, no, you're absolutely right.
[02:25:15.113 --> 02:25:23.320]  So all these callers that call you up and say that there's no conspiracy, they are either crazy or they're with the government or they're just very ignorant.
[02:25:23.600 --> 02:25:24.681]  What do you think it is, Alex?
[02:25:24.761 --> 02:25:25.642]  It's a combination.
[02:25:25.682 --> 02:25:27.484]  I mean, different strokes for different folks.
[02:25:27.544 --> 02:25:28.665]  A lot of them are really stupid.
[02:25:28.705 --> 02:25:29.766]  Others are really cowardly.
[02:25:30.026 --> 02:25:31.827]  So they decide to just say we're lying.
[02:25:32.308 --> 02:25:35.811]  And then others have decided to join it and they're working for the other side.
[02:25:36.251 --> 02:25:36.872]  Well, that's it.
[02:25:37.012 --> 02:25:38.333]  And you know what, Alex?
[02:25:38.673 --> 02:25:41.976]  There is a cure and that is if Americans wake up.
[02:25:42.396 --> 02:25:42.897]  But you see...
[02:25:43.462 --> 02:25:48.968]  Once the older people die, the hope of Americans waking up gets slimmer and slimmer.
[02:25:49.349 --> 02:25:50.751]  Alex, it's been great talking to you.
[02:25:50.771 --> 02:25:51.912]  Hey, man, thanks for holding.
[02:25:51.932 --> 02:25:52.613]  I appreciate it.
[02:25:53.394 --> 02:25:55.216]  Let's go ahead and talk to John.
[02:25:55.896 --> 02:25:58.019]  John, where are you calling us from today?
[02:25:58.039 --> 02:26:01.863]  Where are you calling us from today?
[02:26:02.103 --> 02:26:02.444]  Michigan.
[02:26:02.624 --> 02:26:03.165]  Hey, welcome.
[02:26:03.926 --> 02:26:04.206]  Thank you.
[02:26:04.833 --> 02:26:06.874]  I have one broad topic.
[02:26:07.594 --> 02:26:10.515]  I've been getting into the truth movement quite a bit over the last couple of years.
[02:26:10.555 --> 02:26:13.977]  I've always kind of been knowing that there's a new world order.
[02:26:14.517 --> 02:26:18.979]  But lately there have been websites up that say, yeah, yeah, the government's taking your rights.
[02:26:19.539 --> 02:26:20.960]  Yeah, yeah, you have to make a decision.
[02:26:21.000 --> 02:26:21.800]  Resist.
[02:26:21.820 --> 02:26:23.220]  Or you could live underneath the radar.
[02:26:23.881 --> 02:26:32.484]  Well, I think at this point, if you're at the point where you're at these websites that say resist or live under the radar, live under the radar is great, do this, this, this, this, you're already in files.
[02:26:33.224 --> 02:26:34.185]  You're already going to be...
[02:26:34.867 --> 02:26:36.968]  Tried it off to the FEMA death camps and killed.
[02:26:37.068 --> 02:26:37.989]  Oh, yeah.
[02:26:38.089 --> 02:26:40.030]  They know who's trying to live off radar.
[02:26:40.951 --> 02:26:46.194]  That's exactly... That's like turning a spotlight on in the middle of a dark night.
[02:26:46.794 --> 02:26:49.936]  People who... Are you their caller?
[02:26:51.057 --> 02:26:51.757]  Oh, he just dropped.
[02:26:51.957 --> 02:26:52.658]  We didn't drop you, sir.
[02:26:52.678 --> 02:26:53.418]  Your phone cut out.
[02:26:54.699 --> 02:26:55.039]  Listen.
[02:26:55.974 --> 02:26:57.655]  It's good to not give them all your data.
[02:26:57.735 --> 02:27:05.461]  It's good to do things under the table as much as you can as a practice just to keep some of the untracked society still in place.
[02:27:06.101 --> 02:27:19.911]  But if you're trying to live completely under the radar, it is impossible unless you live as like a homeless person in between some green belt, say, in a major city or a place like Austin.
[02:27:21.708 --> 02:27:23.129]  We've got to fight this thing.
[02:27:23.169 --> 02:27:25.230]  We've got to get up on our hind legs and fight it.
[02:27:25.650 --> 02:27:30.372]  I've told you, folks, if it was some new great country like the U.S., some free place, I'd leave.
[02:27:32.053 --> 02:27:33.293]  But there's nowhere to go.
[02:27:33.433 --> 02:27:34.714]  Tyranny is the norm.
[02:27:35.274 --> 02:27:36.614]  Nowhere to run to, baby.
[02:27:36.775 --> 02:27:37.935]  Nowhere to hide.
[02:27:39.896 --> 02:27:45.238]  And what just happened is we've had a lot of weirdness today, and I figured it was the network.
[02:27:46.254 --> 02:27:46.575]  Okay.
[02:27:46.715 --> 02:27:47.015]  Yeah, it's up.
[02:28:15.781 --> 02:28:17.402]  Some of the other news I haven't really detailed yet.
[02:28:17.462 --> 02:28:19.463]  North Korea says it will conduct nuclear tests.
[02:28:19.603 --> 02:28:22.265]  What our government's saying they'll do about that.
[02:28:22.965 --> 02:28:27.288]  Also, the riddle of frightening breast cancer epidemic.
[02:28:27.368 --> 02:28:28.308]  Every cancer is up.
[02:28:28.909 --> 02:28:33.311]  Cancers we never had before are not just appearing, but at record levels.
[02:28:34.792 --> 02:28:38.574]  And all I can say is, well, we'll tell you what's behind it.
[02:28:38.614 --> 02:28:39.535]  I bet you can guess.
[02:28:39.815 --> 02:28:41.256]  It's a cocktail of things as usual.
[02:28:42.290 --> 02:28:43.911]  It's a little present from your government.
[02:28:43.931 --> 02:28:45.952]  I hope you are enjoying it.
[02:28:45.992 --> 02:28:46.893]  We'll be right back.
[02:28:50.595 --> 02:28:51.496]  We're on the march.
[02:28:51.996 --> 02:28:53.577]  The empire's on the run.
[02:28:54.518 --> 02:28:57.200]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:00.299 --> 02:29:02.941]  Is your child disrespectful, defiant, or obnoxious?
[02:29:03.261 --> 02:29:05.463]  Does everything turn into an argument with your kid?
[02:29:05.783 --> 02:29:07.485]  I'm behavioral therapist James Lehman.
[02:29:07.705 --> 02:29:11.848]  I'll help you turn your child's behavior around right now with the Total Transformation.

[02:29:17.633 --> 02:29:19.534]  Now when I ask him to do something, he does it.
[02:29:19.915 --> 02:29:25.039]  We've learned verbiage from the Total Transformation program, and it's almost like magic.
[02:29:25.379 --> 02:29:27.801]  If you say those words, they stop arguing.
[02:29:27.881 --> 02:29:33.166]  Defiance, back-talking, lying, acting out in school, even problems with ADD and ADHD.
[02:29:33.386 --> 02:29:36.889]  The Total Transformation will help you solve even the worst behavior problems.
[02:29:37.289 --> 02:29:41.793]  I guarantee your child will listen to you again, and you'll get peace and sanity back in your home.

[02:29:46.496 --> 02:29:46.957]  1-800-373-0402 1-800-373-0402 Call now.
[02:29:53.302 --> 02:29:53.362]  1-800-373-0402
[02:29:59.929 --> 02:30:01.770]  Dad, can we stop?
[02:30:02.110 --> 02:30:03.630]  We need to go to the bathroom.
[02:30:04.050 --> 02:30:04.291]  What?
[02:30:04.651 --> 02:30:05.031]  Again?
[02:30:05.431 --> 02:30:07.072]  We just stopped two hours ago.
[02:30:07.132 --> 02:30:11.553]  Honey, let's stop, because I gave the kids their spark-burking water bottles.
[02:30:11.793 --> 02:30:13.074]  Why did you do that?
[02:30:13.294 --> 02:30:19.096]  Because they can't drink and talk at the same time, and that way we don't have to listen to them singing, Are we there yet?
[02:30:19.376 --> 02:30:20.416]  Are we there yet?
[02:30:20.516 --> 02:30:21.577]  for the entire trip.
[02:30:21.837 --> 02:30:24.037]  Hmm, I didn't think about that.
[02:30:24.498 --> 02:30:25.518]  Great idea.
[02:30:25.538 --> 02:30:28.339]  Yeah, and it's cheap entertainment for the kids.
[02:30:28.740 --> 02:30:31.224]  Bottled water costs around 75 cents a bottle.
[02:30:31.425 --> 02:30:35.812]  And using our Berkey Sport bottles, it costs us less than two and a half cents per refill.
[02:30:36.092 --> 02:30:36.413]  Honey?
[02:30:37.219 --> 02:30:38.459]  You're terrific!
[02:30:38.860 --> 02:30:40.340]  Oh, honey, so are you.
[02:30:40.460 --> 02:30:43.861]  You're the one that bought the family our sport Berkey water bottles.
[02:30:44.141 --> 02:30:44.941]  Now can we stop?
[02:30:45.442 --> 02:30:46.162]  I need to go, too.

[02:31:00.876 --> 02:31:03.457]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here with an important question.

[02:32:14.485 --> 02:32:22.450]  Speaking of cancer, in the mid-1920s, they discovered that most cancers were viral.
[02:32:23.750 --> 02:32:24.971]  That's what viruses do.
[02:32:25.031 --> 02:32:27.492]  They have a debate on whether a virus is alive or not.
[02:32:27.552 --> 02:32:28.673]  Most scientists think it's alive.
[02:32:29.033 --> 02:32:30.754]  But really, it's like a computer program.
[02:32:31.715 --> 02:32:39.219]  And because it does reproduce, but there's a few other aspects to it that make them think that it isn't really alive.
[02:32:39.279 --> 02:32:43.301]  But the point is, it plugs into different types of cells, depending on what the virus is designed to do.
[02:32:44.016 --> 02:32:55.223]  And then it programs the nucleus of the cell to create more of the viruses, and then the cell explodes, disgorging millions more of the virus.
[02:32:55.883 --> 02:33:03.628]  Your body moves in with its troops, its T lymphocytes go in and program and command as generals of the rest of the white blood cells who swarm in.
[02:33:05.229 --> 02:33:08.611]  And a lot of this research is showing that it's even stuff like leukemias virus
[02:33:09.534 --> 02:33:16.136]  Many types of leukemia are virus triggered because they go in and trigger the white blood cells to start overproducing.
[02:33:16.996 --> 02:33:22.678]  Or they go in and trigger the cells to start rapidly reproducing.
[02:33:23.018 --> 02:33:29.960]  Because all viruses don't just go in and reprogram to form simply more viruses.
[02:33:31.680 --> 02:33:36.902]  They do that in a reproductive phase, but then in some of their other bizarre ways,
[02:33:38.034 --> 02:33:42.579]  It gets off in all these weird technical scientific terms, but you can go read about it.
[02:33:42.599 --> 02:33:45.062]  Just go type cancer viruses into Google.
[02:33:45.102 --> 02:33:49.026]  You'll see thousands of big scholarly reports and research on it.
[02:33:50.146 --> 02:33:53.988]  And they go in there and they start reprogramming everything and you get cancer.
[02:33:54.188 --> 02:34:19.601]  And a lot of times your body goes in and fights it off, but once you've gotten older and your cells have divided so many times and you've gotten to where your cells move slower and divide slower and you don't have as many troops basically and you've been toxified and eaten all these heavy metals and poisons and genetically modified foods, your immune system is all broken down and the cancer just starts spreading.
[02:34:20.211 --> 02:34:20.772]  We're good to go.
[02:34:20.792 --> 02:34:21.332]  We're good to go.
[02:34:38.170 --> 02:34:40.011]  And they don't want to cure cancer.
[02:34:40.072 --> 02:34:43.774]  They don't want to give you real treatments that will get rid of it.
[02:34:44.214 --> 02:34:53.601]  They want to treat you to keep you alive as long as possible with that cancer and to suck as much money out of you as they can.
[02:34:53.621 --> 02:34:57.124]  I mean, if you're worth $10 million, they're going to probably suck $5 million of it out of you.
[02:34:57.504 --> 02:35:04.809]  If you're only worth a couple hundred thousand, they'll get all that, and by the time they're done, you know, when you're dead, your kids will have to sell your house to just pay for it.
[02:35:06.095 --> 02:35:17.207]  But to make a long story short, the Rockefellers, back in the 20s, this is all publicly available, bought up a bunch of the big hospitals, started cancer research, and paid for research into cancer viruses.
[02:35:18.269 --> 02:35:22.093]  And clearly then had those viruses disseminated.
[02:35:23.115 --> 02:35:41.668]  And most of the vaccines that they test, even if they aren't connected originally to an animal that would have the viruses, even if they're bred, say, on egg yolks or egg whites, for some reason there are still these viruses that attack humans showing up.
[02:35:43.670 --> 02:35:45.891]  And that's a big cause of it.
[02:35:45.931 --> 02:35:48.413]  Then you have all the genetically modified food.
[02:35:48.433 --> 02:35:50.795]  You have all the new toxins in the air and the water.
[02:35:51.908 --> 02:35:53.089]  It's a cocktail of it.
[02:35:53.529 --> 02:36:01.755]  And no one can deny that we've gone from 1 in 24,000 having autism 20 years ago to 1 in 1,600.
[02:36:01.815 --> 02:36:02.856]  The new numbers are coming out.
[02:36:03.076 --> 02:36:04.797]  1 in 168, they're now saying.
[02:36:06.118 --> 02:36:07.118]  That's official numbers.
[02:36:08.559 --> 02:36:11.121]  Now trending for the end of this year.
[02:36:11.161 --> 02:36:12.582]  We've been talking about it for two years now.
[02:36:13.102 --> 02:36:15.184]  Those studies are now coming to their fruition.
[02:36:16.287 --> 02:36:22.230]  We know that all forms of cancer are up, in some cases thousands of percentiles.
[02:36:22.610 --> 02:36:24.971]  We know childhood leukemias are off the charts.
[02:36:25.711 --> 02:36:28.452]  We know that every form of illness is off the charts.
[02:36:29.172 --> 02:36:36.655]  We know that diabetes is off the charts, up what, 3,000% from what it was just 34 years ago?
[02:36:36.955 --> 02:36:38.156]  You can go pull all those numbers.
[02:36:40.393 --> 02:36:45.996]  Everything is basically gyrating out of control right now.
[02:36:47.056 --> 02:36:48.977]  And I'm not trying to give you gloom and doom.
[02:36:49.497 --> 02:36:50.978]  By the way, you guys weren't clear.
[02:36:50.998 --> 02:36:51.919]  Is Ted in there?
[02:36:51.939 --> 02:36:54.060]  Oh, he is.
[02:36:54.080 --> 02:36:55.120]  Nobody really told me.
[02:36:55.160 --> 02:36:55.440]  Sorry.
[02:36:55.760 --> 02:36:56.981]  I won't go to him in a second then.
[02:36:57.021 --> 02:36:57.981]  I was waiting for that word.
[02:36:59.162 --> 02:37:01.183]  Here is a story out of the Daily Mail.
[02:37:01.743 --> 02:37:05.605]  Riddle of Frightening Breast Cancer Epidemic.
[02:37:07.430 --> 02:37:20.319]  And the article reports that it says breast cancer cases have hit frightening levels and more modern lifestyle and prosperity may be to blame.
[02:37:20.880 --> 02:37:27.004]  Figures today show an 80% increase since 1971 with one in nine women now developing the disease.
[02:37:27.404 --> 02:37:30.707]  Factors leading to the risk include obesity, smaller family size,
[02:37:31.283 --> 02:37:31.924]  What does that mean?
[02:37:32.464 --> 02:37:33.425]  Less breastfeeding.
[02:37:33.465 --> 02:37:34.085]  Oh, that's true.
[02:37:34.226 --> 02:37:41.352]  As more women go out to work earlier periods and later menopause.
[02:37:41.512 --> 02:37:42.653]  That's a little way of telling you.
[02:37:42.933 --> 02:37:43.874]  Hormone replacement.
[02:37:43.894 --> 02:37:44.955]  Yeah, that does increase it.
[02:37:45.715 --> 02:37:47.577]  And I'm not saying it's just the cancer viruses.
[02:37:47.597 --> 02:37:48.178]  That's part of it.
[02:37:48.738 --> 02:37:57.145]  It is the fact that the more you breastfeed and the more children you have, the less chance of having breast cancer you're going to get.
[02:37:57.626 --> 02:37:58.847]  And when you have an abortion...
[02:38:01.578 --> 02:38:03.039]  There's a whole bunch of studies on this.
[02:38:03.799 --> 02:38:07.141]  Cervical cancer, breast cancer goes off the charts.
[02:38:08.001 --> 02:38:09.682]  Brain cancer goes off the charts.
[02:38:10.142 --> 02:38:11.863]  Your body says, I don't like what you did.
[02:38:11.883 --> 02:38:12.843]  I'm going to kill you.
[02:38:14.544 --> 02:38:16.004]  That's how the body works, folks.
[02:38:16.665 --> 02:38:21.246]  Increased use of HRT and growing alcohol consumption are also cited.
[02:38:21.306 --> 02:38:25.608]  The pill has been linked to some cases, but it cannot account for the startling increase.
[02:38:25.648 --> 02:38:27.309]  So it's a lot of stuff.
[02:38:29.410 --> 02:38:29.570]  But
[02:38:30.818 --> 02:38:35.082]  That is just one type of cancer.
[02:38:36.824 --> 02:38:39.226]  Men's prostate cancer is way up.
[02:38:40.067 --> 02:38:41.909]  And it's not just more diagnosis.
[02:38:41.989 --> 02:38:44.271]  It's not just men are living longer because we're not.
[02:38:45.933 --> 02:38:47.695]  You look at those numbers, it's off the charts.
[02:38:48.816 --> 02:38:55.022]  But compared to childhood leukemia and other diseases, other types of cancer...
[02:38:56.070 --> 02:38:59.293]  Breast cancer, it's 80% increase is nothing.
[02:38:59.633 --> 02:39:02.555]  Okay, I'm sorry to have my leader hold.
[02:39:02.615 --> 02:39:03.676]  I was unaware he was there.
[02:39:05.197 --> 02:39:10.761]  Ted Anderson, we have him on every few months, and I wanted to have him on for a few minutes with us, and I'll get into some other news here in a moment.
[02:39:11.782 --> 02:39:23.091]  Because Midas Resources is the parent company of the GCN Radio Network, and Ted has poured his heart, his soul, his blood, his tears into this network.
[02:39:24.233 --> 02:39:25.915]  And we really do appreciate Ted.
[02:39:26.495 --> 02:39:33.081]  And when I've made gold purchases a few times a year, I have shopped around and Ted isn't the most expensive.
[02:39:33.101 --> 02:39:34.222]  He isn't the cheapest either.
[02:39:34.242 --> 02:39:36.244]  He's, I'd say, about in the...
[02:39:37.653 --> 02:39:39.194]  You know, 20%.
[02:39:39.234 --> 02:39:40.435]  The lowest being zero.
[02:39:40.475 --> 02:39:40.935]  He's in the 20%.
[02:39:42.095 --> 02:39:44.316]  And they've always given me great service and done a great job.
[02:39:44.356 --> 02:39:48.438]  And I have friends and family that have used Modest Resources and are really happy with what they've gotten.
[02:39:48.778 --> 02:39:50.019]  They've got collector's coins.
[02:39:50.039 --> 02:39:51.220]  They've got semi-numismatic.
[02:39:51.240 --> 02:39:52.020]  They have bullion.
[02:39:52.380 --> 02:39:55.462]  We've got something today for you that is a numismatic.
[02:39:55.522 --> 02:39:56.242]  It's a collectible.
[02:39:58.703 --> 02:39:59.523]  Right at melt.
[02:40:00.204 --> 02:40:02.845]  It's just a very small profit here.
[02:40:02.865 --> 02:40:04.746]  And I think they should be able to make a profit and operate.
[02:40:05.507 --> 02:40:09.609]  Some people think that this show, or Genesis or Midas, can operate without money.
[02:40:09.629 --> 02:40:12.531]  I've even heard that locally said in the last few days.
[02:40:12.611 --> 02:40:13.271]  It's delusional.
[02:40:14.091 --> 02:40:19.574]  But I hope you will give Ted a call, and I hope you will buy some of these $5 pieces.
[02:40:19.914 --> 02:40:21.155]  Ted, thank you for coming on with us.
[02:40:21.495 --> 02:40:22.956]  Hey, thanks for having me up, Alex.
[02:40:23.036 --> 02:40:25.037]  And by the way, I really like Terror Storm.
[02:40:25.077 --> 02:40:26.437]  That was a good production.
[02:40:26.878 --> 02:40:28.158]  Oh, you saw the new film?
[02:40:28.378 --> 02:40:29.039]  Oh, yeah.
[02:40:29.059 --> 02:40:29.739]  Just amazing.
[02:40:30.219 --> 02:40:31.800]  Did you see it online, or did we mail you a copy?
[02:40:32.060 --> 02:40:33.361]  It was the one that you emailed me.
[02:40:35.043 --> 02:40:40.568]  Downloading it, you'd have to have a fast internet connection to get it, but of course at the network here we do.
[02:40:40.808 --> 02:40:42.489]  I thought it was an excellent production.
[02:40:42.549 --> 02:40:45.031]  Well, thanks for the terror storm plug, Ted.
[02:40:45.112 --> 02:40:47.013]  You haven't been on in, I guess, about two or three months.
[02:40:48.014 --> 02:40:48.715]  It's been a while.
[02:40:49.075 --> 02:40:50.676]  You've got a good deal for folks today.
[02:40:50.696 --> 02:40:53.659]  I always ask you to give my listeners the best deal you can.
[02:40:53.679 --> 02:40:55.821]  This is the best deal in-house right now.
[02:40:55.881 --> 02:40:56.441]  It's a great deal.
[02:40:56.501 --> 02:40:57.122]  Tell folks about it.
[02:40:57.302 --> 02:40:58.506]  Yeah, here's what it is, Alex.
[02:40:58.566 --> 02:41:04.361]  It's the $5 gold piece, which I think is such a great buy because of the fact that you get smaller pieces of gold to carry with you.
[02:41:05.126 --> 02:41:14.954]  And when the market is really tough and things are going in the wrong direction and you don't know if your dollars that you're carrying with you are going to work or not, you know, you need to have some smaller gold.
[02:41:14.994 --> 02:41:17.436]  So that's why I recommend the coin.
[02:41:17.476 --> 02:41:20.358]  Right now it's trading at $213 per coin.
[02:41:20.378 --> 02:41:22.040]  You can pick up the rolls of 10 for $2130.
[02:41:22.640 --> 02:41:30.787]  But I just have to say right now at this time, it's time to get in because of the fact that the prices have backed off a little bit.
[02:41:31.555 --> 02:41:35.403]  This coin was trading for $260 here just a couple months ago.
[02:41:35.423 --> 02:41:40.233]  And we all know that the United States has not solved all of its economic problems.
[02:41:40.333 --> 02:41:42.678]  Right now we've got more problems we can shake a stick at.
[02:41:43.780 --> 02:41:46.242]  I don't look at a month grid or a six-month trend.
[02:41:46.383 --> 02:41:49.765]  I look at one-year graphs, two-year graphs, five-year graphs.
[02:41:50.226 --> 02:41:54.469]  You look at a one-year graph, a five-year graph, gold is going straight up.
[02:41:54.609 --> 02:42:01.615]  But when I bought gold from you years ago at $300 an ounce, I buy a coin here, two or three coins there.
[02:42:02.075 --> 02:42:03.776]  I never have sold one of those.
[02:42:03.976 --> 02:42:05.698]  I've literally physically buried them.
[02:42:06.238 --> 02:42:07.579]  We're good to go.
[02:42:27.777 --> 02:42:30.659]  Going to go up because the dollar is continuing its slide.
[02:42:30.920 --> 02:42:36.744]  The economy, every major real indice is going down from real estate to the dollar's value to stocks.
[02:42:37.085 --> 02:42:48.694]  Stocks are at an all-time high, but with the devaluation of the dollar, 40-plus percent, the stock market's really at 6,000, plus the Dow Jones Industrial 30 has losers taken out and winners added.
[02:42:48.934 --> 02:42:49.975]  It's not a real index.
[02:42:50.215 --> 02:42:54.238]  No, it isn't, and you can tell what's going on in the real world out there anyways.
[02:42:54.338 --> 02:42:54.598]  I think?
[02:43:15.684 --> 02:43:19.548]  And it's going to be very worthless right here in their own location.
[02:43:20.168 --> 02:43:25.833]  And as the thing compounds, the United States continues to deficit spend and create more currency.
[02:43:25.873 --> 02:43:28.155]  The value of the money is just going right through the floor.
[02:43:28.555 --> 02:43:28.996]  Exactly.
[02:43:29.016 --> 02:43:31.258]  I just want to add that I've bought a lot of small coins.
[02:43:31.917 --> 02:43:35.219]  You know, again, one or two coins here and there every few months, folks, over the years.
[02:43:35.859 --> 02:43:38.840]  And small coins always cost a little more per ounce.
[02:43:39.601 --> 02:43:42.082]  But when you go to trade them in, you also get a higher amount.
[02:43:42.122 --> 02:43:47.764]  It's for some reason there's a higher value in the smaller coins and in this quarter ounce.
[02:43:48.125 --> 02:43:49.065]  Why is that, Ted?
[02:43:49.345 --> 02:43:55.468]  Well, for number one, it's a coin that was issued by the United States government for $235 a coin.
[02:43:55.508 --> 02:43:59.610]  So the floor level on the coin is much higher than what the price is currently trading.
[02:44:00.590 --> 02:44:07.274]  But the second thing is, smaller coins, it takes just as much energy to produce a small coin as it does a large one.
[02:44:07.754 --> 02:44:11.916]  And so you have less gold available and the cost of production goes up.
[02:44:12.732 --> 02:44:14.772]  And it just always has had a tendency.
[02:44:14.832 --> 02:44:17.013]  Small coins, whether if you're dealing with U.S.
[02:44:17.073 --> 02:44:22.414]  Eagles, Crewgrounds, Maple Leafs, it doesn't matter what you're trading in, the smaller coins have always carried a bit of a premium.
[02:44:22.874 --> 02:44:28.095]  But the neat part about this stuff is that the United States government issued it as a collection piece.
[02:44:28.155 --> 02:44:30.095]  People had to buy it from the U.S.
[02:44:30.195 --> 02:44:31.935]  Mint as a collector item.
[02:44:32.215 --> 02:44:39.317]  They can't come back and say it's bullion, turn it in, confiscating gold, because of the fact that they've already defined it themselves as collector.
[02:44:39.357 --> 02:44:41.037]  So it's real good, very private.
[02:44:41.597 --> 02:44:52.583]  As a matter of fact, if you're interested in gold, you should just call up and ask for the public versus private document that we put together so people could understand what is public, what is private in gold trading.
[02:44:52.603 --> 02:44:53.043]  Sure, sure.
[02:44:53.063 --> 02:44:55.264]  Let's give folks the number, and this is private.
[02:44:55.284 --> 02:44:55.744]  1-800-686-2237.
[02:44:55.764 --> 02:44:56.144]  It's a great deal.
[02:44:59.486 --> 02:45:02.048]  Give that number for the listeners out there, Ted.
[02:45:02.148 --> 02:45:05.110]  Yeah, it's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:45:05.150 --> 02:45:08.712]  Just ask for the $5 gold special heard on Alex Jones' show.
[02:45:09.132 --> 02:45:11.053]  And I've got to say it too, Alex.
[02:45:11.113 --> 02:45:12.834]  I really appreciate the listeners.
[02:45:12.894 --> 02:45:15.136]  They are the ones that have carried this network forward.
[02:45:15.576 --> 02:45:17.497]  They're the ones that have financially supported it.
[02:45:17.517 --> 02:45:20.339]  You're not just protecting yourself with some gold at a good price.
[02:45:20.379 --> 02:45:23.881]  You're also supporting those that support freedom here on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:45:24.241 --> 02:45:25.782]  Ted, give them the number slowly.
[02:45:25.802 --> 02:45:25.862]  1-800-686-2237.
[02:45:29.803 --> 02:45:29.863]  2-2-3-7.
[02:45:29.943 --> 02:45:31.004]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:45:31.024 --> 02:45:31.204]  1-800-686-2237.
[02:45:31.284 --> 02:45:41.431]  And you can even call them up until the evening tonight, and you can call them back tomorrow.
[02:45:42.011 --> 02:45:42.952]  But call them right now.
[02:45:42.972 --> 02:45:43.412]  1-800-686-2237.
[02:45:43.432 --> 02:45:49.116]  And give yourself a little bit of gold, folks.
[02:45:49.196 --> 02:45:49.776]  It's private.
[02:45:49.796 --> 02:45:50.357]  It's portable.
[02:45:51.077 --> 02:45:52.579]  It's really important to have.
[02:45:52.719 --> 02:45:53.360]  I believe in it.
[02:45:53.660 --> 02:45:56.263]  It's not a fiat currency that the bankers can devalue.
[02:45:56.283 --> 02:46:00.348]  That's why the mainstream media always discourages getting gold and holding gold.
[02:46:00.869 --> 02:46:03.211]  They'll tell you, go buy gold stocks, hold paper.
[02:46:03.412 --> 02:46:03.972]  Uh-uh, folks.
[02:46:04.313 --> 02:46:05.334]  Hold the physical metal.
[02:46:05.354 --> 02:46:05.414]  1-800-686-2237.
[02:46:08.892 --> 02:46:17.981]  I bought gold at $300 an ounce five, six years ago that, again, is now worth over $600 in the coin and by that $600 in the melt.
[02:46:18.661 --> 02:46:20.483]  And it's a good investment.
[02:46:21.063 --> 02:46:23.185]  And if gold goes up to $800, I'm not selling.
[02:46:23.225 --> 02:46:25.628]  If it goes down to $400, I'm not selling.
[02:46:25.668 --> 02:46:26.669]  It's clearly going to go up.
[02:46:26.769 --> 02:46:28.250]  All the evidence shows that.
[02:46:29.091 --> 02:46:29.351]  But 1-800-686-2237.
[02:46:32.874 --> 02:46:33.494]  All right, folks.
[02:46:54.711 --> 02:47:07.299]  And by the way, just a program note, we have started the syndication of my Sunday evening program, 4 to 6 p.m., through MS Communications on News Radio 590 KLBJ here in Austin, through Genesis.
[02:47:07.439 --> 02:47:11.242]  Rumors of my demise have been greatly exaggerated, as Mark Twain once said.
[02:47:11.922 --> 02:47:14.324]  One of the locals here was running around saying that...
[02:47:15.211 --> 02:47:29.295]  It's always some new rumor that I was leaving Genesis and I was going with MS Communications and everybody better abandon... It's always more made-up mindlessness that I then have to respond to and then I'm bad for responding to this info.
[02:47:29.755 --> 02:47:30.675]  I understand how that works.
[02:47:31.495 --> 02:47:36.797]  But this is exciting because KLBJ has won national awards.
[02:47:37.517 --> 02:47:40.798]  In fact, they were in the top five of the best...
[02:47:42.059 --> 02:47:44.680]  Talk radio stations, news talk stations in the country this year.
[02:47:44.940 --> 02:47:47.561]  They've won the award before as the best talk station in the country.
[02:47:47.941 --> 02:47:50.382]  They've won all the big prestigious news awards.
[02:47:50.802 --> 02:47:52.783]  They've been around for 60 years.
[02:47:53.683 --> 02:47:55.964]  And it's an amazing radio station.
[02:47:56.764 --> 02:47:58.284]  I'm really honored to be on it.
[02:47:58.324 --> 02:48:00.625]  It's not owned by the president's family anymore.
[02:48:01.285 --> 02:48:05.607]  It's owned by MS Communications, same folks that own Texas Monthly and a bunch of other big radio stations.
[02:48:05.647 --> 02:48:09.128]  And they're planning on putting me on a bunch of their MS stations.
[02:48:10.089 --> 02:48:10.710]  On Sundays.
[02:48:11.330 --> 02:48:31.245]  And then for all of the great Genesis affiliates out there, whether it's KCXL in Kansas City, or WBCR in Knoxville, Tennessee, or stations in Southern California, or stations in upstate New York, or stations in Ohio, or stations in Illinois, or stations in Florida, or stations in Georgia.
[02:48:31.265 --> 02:48:33.807]  We've got stations all over the place.
[02:48:34.308 --> 02:48:35.148]  And a growing list.
[02:48:35.248 --> 02:48:35.869]  Montana.
[02:48:37.705 --> 02:48:38.305]  Wyoming.
[02:48:38.345 --> 02:48:39.166]  Places like that.
[02:48:39.606 --> 02:48:41.427]  A new live Sunday show.
[02:48:41.447 --> 02:48:42.288]  4 to 6 p.m.
[02:48:42.348 --> 02:48:42.768]  Central.
[02:48:43.289 --> 02:48:46.991]  I guess that would be 3 to 5 Mountain.
[02:48:47.811 --> 02:48:49.933]  I guess that would be 2 to 4 Pacific.
[02:48:50.713 --> 02:48:52.574]  That would be 5 to 7 Eastern.
[02:48:53.235 --> 02:48:54.796]  And we're really proud of the broadcast.
[02:48:54.856 --> 02:48:56.457]  And we tested the syndication this weekend.
[02:48:56.717 --> 02:49:00.199]  It will be syndicated out on the bird for you this Sunday.
[02:49:00.680 --> 02:49:01.560]  So call Genesis.
[02:49:01.600 --> 02:49:02.881]  Sign the affiliate agreement.
[02:49:03.441 --> 02:49:06.123]  Just a simple agreement that you'll carry it for a month or two.
[02:49:07.202 --> 02:49:11.143]  Let us know if you're going to dump it and that this many of our ads run.
[02:49:11.543 --> 02:49:12.463]  I'm excited about that.
[02:49:12.663 --> 02:49:13.723]  Okay, final segment.
[02:49:13.743 --> 02:49:15.584]  I'm not going to take any calls in the final segment.
[02:49:16.024 --> 02:49:22.465]  I'm going to run over this, what's happening with the North Korea says it will conduct nuclear tests, what that means.
[02:49:23.105 --> 02:49:26.706]  And I want to hit on a few other little tidbits that we have here in front of us.
[02:49:27.346 --> 02:49:34.267]  While I'm busy plugging, go to googlevideo.com, click on video, and then...
[02:49:35.945 --> 02:49:38.486]  Type in Terror Storm and get my film for free.
[02:49:38.506 --> 02:49:40.946]  And get it out to everyone you know.
[02:49:41.686 --> 02:49:43.967]  The most effective tool we've seen is films.
[02:49:44.727 --> 02:49:46.727]  That's why Terror Storm has been put out for free.
[02:49:46.747 --> 02:49:52.329]  And if you believe in it and think it's an important film, get a hard copy DVD in super high digital quality.
[02:49:52.709 --> 02:49:54.169]  Make copies from that and give it to people.
[02:49:54.749 --> 02:49:55.650]  It's so effective.
[02:49:55.670 --> 02:49:57.730]  Please join us in the battle for the republic.
[02:50:03.201 --> 02:50:06.363]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[02:50:06.703 --> 02:50:08.604]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[02:50:09.025 --> 02:50:16.689]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:50:17.350 --> 02:50:24.394]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:50:24.814 --> 02:50:27.756]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran.
[02:50:28.096 --> 02:50:30.457]  The White House program to disseminate fake news.
[02:50:30.878 --> 02:50:31.698]  NSA spies.
[02:50:33.108 --> 02:50:36.230]  The latest 9-11 information and much, much more.
[02:50:36.530 --> 02:50:40.031]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:50:40.491 --> 02:50:42.412]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:50:42.752 --> 02:50:46.653]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:52:53.778 --> 02:52:58.319]  HerbalHealer.com Celebrating 18 years of dedication.
[02:53:01.040 --> 02:53:03.781]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[02:53:03.801 --> 02:53:07.622]  It's Alex Jones only on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:53:11.787 --> 02:53:13.928]  Clues shot in ATTA video.
[02:53:14.348 --> 02:53:16.189]  I should have spent a whole hour on this.
[02:53:16.329 --> 02:53:17.409]  It's just so ridiculous.
[02:53:17.449 --> 02:53:18.110]  What's the point?
[02:53:19.190 --> 02:53:21.051]  Number one, we know Muhammad ATTA was a U.S.
[02:53:21.071 --> 02:53:21.871]  government asset.
[02:53:22.131 --> 02:53:28.614]  That's confirmed by embassy heads, deans of defense language school, Monterey, California, Pensacola Naval Air Station.
[02:53:29.645 --> 02:53:33.448]  All over the place, it's confirmed they were in the employ, protected by the U.S.
[02:53:33.488 --> 02:53:33.748]  government.
[02:53:33.788 --> 02:53:37.230]  We know they went to Pakistan, Afghanistan, then Malaysia, and back.
[02:53:37.590 --> 02:53:45.695]  Right when this was recorded, it's on record that the embassy head, and we've interviewed him, Springman, was ordered to let him in, and they said, but his flag is terrorist.
[02:53:45.735 --> 02:53:48.057]  And they said, listen, that's their CIA cover.
[02:53:48.777 --> 02:53:50.217]  Now, I've interviewed that embassy head.
[02:53:50.417 --> 02:53:51.658]  It's been in the Canadian news.
[02:53:51.898 --> 02:53:53.218]  You'll never hear about it in the U.S.
[02:53:53.698 --> 02:53:59.059]  So now we get a video from the same time with him laughing and giggling and then reading a martyr statement.
[02:53:59.299 --> 02:54:00.700]  But notice they can't give us audio.
[02:54:02.020 --> 02:54:03.560]  Classic bull.
[02:54:04.480 --> 02:54:05.200]  This is the same.
[02:54:05.421 --> 02:54:07.221]  And look, they keep it, oh, five years.
[02:54:07.281 --> 02:54:08.801]  It pops up right before the election.
[02:54:09.581 --> 02:54:10.822]  And there's about 100 other points.
[02:54:10.882 --> 02:54:16.403]  It just came out that Daniel Pearl, the CIA agent, was killed by MI6.
[02:54:18.074 --> 02:54:19.435]  I mean, this is mainstream news now.
[02:54:19.455 --> 02:54:20.036]  That's AP.
[02:54:21.137 --> 02:54:22.598]  With Paresh Musarif saying that.
[02:54:22.898 --> 02:54:25.140]  The Indians are saying that British and U.S.
[02:54:25.160 --> 02:54:27.862]  intelligence through Pakistani intelligence are bombing India.
[02:54:28.422 --> 02:54:30.824]  I mean, you just can't hide this stuff anymore, okay?
[02:54:32.105 --> 02:54:37.469]  And I was talking to a national Indian newspaper with the Telegraph, and they were going, oh yeah, we all know it's your government.
[02:54:38.549 --> 02:54:40.711]  I mean, you know, and that's our ally, folks.
[02:54:40.751 --> 02:54:41.972]  Oh yeah, we all know it's your government.
[02:54:43.333 --> 02:54:45.875]  They get power out of this, which is so naive.
[02:54:46.972 --> 02:54:48.976]  North Korea says it will conduct nuclear tests.
[02:54:49.036 --> 02:54:54.387]  An increasingly isolated North Korea said on Tuesday it would conduct its first ever nuclear test, blaming a U.S.
[02:54:54.427 --> 02:54:57.073]  threat of nuclear war and sanctions for forcing its hand.
[02:54:59.122 --> 02:55:01.543]  That's Kim Jong-il really asking for it.
[02:55:01.603 --> 02:55:02.663]  Who gave him the reactors?
[02:55:03.183 --> 02:55:04.084]  Donald Rumsfeld.
[02:55:04.104 --> 02:55:05.084]  Who approved aspartame?
[02:55:05.104 --> 02:55:05.824]  Donald Rumsfeld.
[02:55:06.024 --> 02:55:07.105]  Who gave Saddam the weapons?
[02:55:07.145 --> 02:55:07.905]  Donald Rumsfeld.
[02:55:08.125 --> 02:55:10.866]  Who approved Terminator genes and Monsanto?
[02:55:11.186 --> 02:55:11.906]  Donald Rumsfeld.
[02:55:11.946 --> 02:55:15.707]  I mean, it's as if he's Satan and appears.
[02:55:15.787 --> 02:55:18.788]  Rumsfeld probably appeared when Christ was on the cross.
[02:55:19.508 --> 02:55:21.729]  I mean, literally, they say the devil popped up.
[02:55:22.049 --> 02:55:24.010]  I mean, this guy is like the devil, folks.
[02:55:24.990 --> 02:55:27.971]  North Korean nuclear tests would be an unacceptable threat
[02:55:28.729 --> 02:55:34.652]  A nuclear weapons test by North Korea would pose an unacceptable threat to peace and stability in Asia and the world.
[02:55:34.752 --> 02:55:34.912]  U.S.
[02:55:34.932 --> 02:55:45.136]  State Department spokesman said in Cairo, a provocative action of this nature would only further isolate North Korea's regime and deny the people of the North the benefits they so rightly deserve.
[02:55:45.536 --> 02:55:45.836]  The U.S.
[02:55:45.856 --> 02:55:52.359]  will continue to work with its allies and partners to discourage such a reckless action and will respond appropriately, whatever that means.
[02:55:53.129 --> 02:55:54.090]  We're good to go.
[02:55:54.110 --> 02:55:54.570]  We're good to go.
[02:56:23.055 --> 02:56:25.516]  It's one thing to live in the country, go to work, save gas.
[02:56:25.656 --> 02:56:29.116]  But if you ride around the city on one, again, you're delusional, folks.
[02:56:29.136 --> 02:56:30.016]  You're asking for it.
[02:56:30.296 --> 02:56:31.917]  Cars are already dangerous enough.
[02:56:32.657 --> 02:56:34.617]  And he hit a telephone pole.
[02:56:34.697 --> 02:56:35.318]  He's dead.
[02:56:35.338 --> 02:56:38.778]  And I remember the Jacobs.
[02:56:38.838 --> 02:56:44.139]  I mean, they look like the Adams family or something.
[02:56:44.179 --> 02:56:45.360]  And we're getting the chip.
[02:56:45.460 --> 02:56:46.440]  Everyone needs it.
[02:56:46.780 --> 02:56:48.960]  He will submit to it.
[02:56:51.481 --> 02:56:52.021]  Poor guy.
[02:56:54.042 --> 02:57:05.811]  A teen engineering prodigy, they always called him a prodigy, who gained national attention in 2002 when he and his family received an identification chip implants on live television and was killed in a motorcycle accident.
[02:57:06.111 --> 02:57:08.453]  You can see these guys in Road to Tyranny.
[02:57:08.793 --> 02:57:13.156]  Then Andy Rooney says we should all be forced to take chips on 60 Minutes to prove we're good.
