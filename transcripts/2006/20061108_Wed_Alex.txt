[00:00:05.422 --> 00:00:06.062]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.723 --> 00:00:07.804]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.504 --> 00:00:09.605]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.245 --> 00:00:11.065]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.826 --> 00:00:12.726]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.387 --> 00:00:17.089]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.569 --> 00:00:21.692]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:30.097 --> 00:00:32.178]  Despite a concerted effort...
[00:00:33.994 --> 00:00:38.936]  And coast-to-coast election fraud being conducted by the Republican crime machine.
[00:00:40.517 --> 00:00:47.561]  The Democratic Party has won a large majority in the House of Representatives with only a few seats still contested.
[00:00:47.581 --> 00:00:51.563]  And it is down to two seats in the Senate.
[00:00:52.603 --> 00:00:55.925]  We should be learning in the next few hours who's going to win.
[00:00:56.025 --> 00:01:02.388]  Fox News is projecting in Virginia and Montana that it will be Democrats and that Libertarian Republicans
[00:01:03.678 --> 00:01:07.459]  Party candidates are going to cause the Republicans to lose.
[00:01:09.199 --> 00:01:16.440]  And I say good, because the Republican Party has deserted conservatives in this nation.
[00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:23.042]  They have posed as conservatives when they are nothing more than a pedophile cult, most of them.
[00:01:23.082 --> 00:01:25.002]  And I'm serious when I say that.
[00:01:25.042 --> 00:01:26.342]  The evidence is overwhelming.
[00:01:27.702 --> 00:01:30.183]  They are a pack of criminals controlled by foreign interests.
[00:01:30.223 --> 00:01:30.383]  Now,
[00:01:31.752 --> 00:01:36.133]  The B-team, the B-string, the second string is going in.
[00:01:36.793 --> 00:01:39.414]  And I think we're going to see a repeat of what we witnessed in 94.
[00:01:39.654 --> 00:01:42.114]  Pelosi will play the part of Newt Gingrich.
[00:01:42.815 --> 00:01:45.815]  She will be credited with engineering the victory when she had nothing to do with it.
[00:01:46.295 --> 00:01:54.937]  And she will ride herd over the new freshman Democrats and ensure that there is not impeachment hearings.
[00:01:55.397 --> 00:01:58.318]  In fact, she's already announced in a speech that we'll be playing later in the hour
[00:01:59.682 --> 00:02:02.123]  But she's going to be in partnership with George Bush.
[00:02:02.163 --> 00:02:02.344]  Yes.
[00:02:02.804 --> 00:02:06.086]  Well, they've always been in partnership to destroy this country.
[00:02:06.126 --> 00:02:17.372]  So, all of you glassy-eyed, celebrating Democrats out in the street, and folks, I mean right out front in my office this morning, Democrats are literally running around celebrating.
[00:02:17.392 --> 00:02:20.494]  There's a Democratic sub-office just across the street from me.
[00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:22.370]  We're good to go.
[00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:47.890]  Are we going to hear now a repeal of the Patriot Act?
[00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:49.970]  A repeal of the Military Commissions Act?
[00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:52.531]  A repeal of the Defense Authorization Act?
[00:02:53.251 --> 00:02:54.572]  No, we're not going to hear it.
[00:02:55.252 --> 00:03:03.174]  And now you watch all these big Democrat websites and, quote, independent websites that have been supporting what we do at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:03:03.614 --> 00:03:04.154]  You watch.
[00:03:04.254 --> 00:03:05.415]  In fact, we're already starting to see it.
[00:03:05.775 --> 00:03:08.436]  They're starting to go, now, now, don't bash the Democrats.
[00:03:08.496 --> 00:03:09.376]  Everything's okay.
[00:03:11.002 --> 00:03:18.803]  So we have at least deadened to a certain extent, at least symbolically, the power of the neocons.
[00:03:20.504 --> 00:03:35.827]  And now in the eyes of the world, people would have seen a Republican victory as an endorsement of secret prisons, secret torture, torture of children, FEMA camps, preemptive war, invasions of innocent countries.
[00:03:37.067 --> 00:03:37.427]  Now...
[00:03:38.317 --> 00:04:05.224]  We need to set about ensuring that that traitorous bucket of evil, I mean, just look at that smiley-faced piece of trash, Nancy Pelosi, we need to ensure that that witch not become Speaker, which they're saying is a foregone conclusion, and we need to ensure a democratic rebellion against her, and we need to ensure that a move towards impeachment of that criminal, George Bush, be launched.
[00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:08.191]  Now, I want to hear from conservatives.
[00:04:08.211 --> 00:04:08.952]  I want to hear from liberals.
[00:04:08.992 --> 00:04:10.213]  I want to hear from truth seekers.
[00:04:10.754 --> 00:04:22.709]  I want to open the phones up, and I want to get your take on strategies on what we can do to ensure that the democratic revolution we're witnessing isn't stunted and blunted and hijacked like the big sweep in...
[00:04:24.972 --> 00:04:26.193]  1994, 12 years ago was.
[00:04:26.713 --> 00:04:27.294]  Now, you watch.
[00:04:27.314 --> 00:04:28.895]  The media is going to make her the figurehead.
[00:04:28.915 --> 00:04:31.097]  They're going to stick her on the cover of magazines.
[00:04:31.397 --> 00:04:34.800]  They're going to make the whole Democratic Revolution about Nancy Pelosi.
[00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:40.204]  She's saying she wants to, quote, be in partnership with Bush against the American people.
[00:04:42.626 --> 00:04:46.169]  And Fox is projecting the Democrats are going to win the Senate, too.
[00:04:48.171 --> 00:04:49.992]  We'll break it all down on the other side.
[00:04:50.032 --> 00:04:51.834]  What does this mean for the invasion of Iran?
[00:04:52.114 --> 00:04:53.475]  Will Bush pull something quick?
[00:04:54.341 --> 00:04:55.521]  Who knows what's going to happen?
[00:04:56.202 --> 00:04:56.722]  Stay with us.
[00:04:56.742 --> 00:04:57.602]  Your call straight ahead.
[00:04:57.622 --> 00:04:58.062]  800-259-9231.
[00:04:58.482 --> 00:05:07.425]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[00:05:07.785 --> 00:05:09.706]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[00:05:10.066 --> 00:05:17.688]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:05:18.399 --> 00:05:25.464]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:05:25.864 --> 00:05:37.291]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:05:37.591 --> 00:05:41.074]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:05:41.554 --> 00:05:43.495]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:05:43.815 --> 00:05:47.658]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:06:01.809 --> 00:06:02.790]  Good morning, honey.
[00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:09.156]  Wow, the weather is beautiful, the cabin is terrific, and it's the first day of our vacation!
[00:06:09.436 --> 00:06:10.037]  Yeah.
[00:06:10.417 --> 00:06:11.838]  Honey, is there something wrong?
[00:06:12.199 --> 00:06:15.602]  Yeah, I just realized we forgot to pack the travel burkey system.
[00:06:16.062 --> 00:06:17.564]  I can't drink this cabin water.
[00:06:18.004 --> 00:06:19.726]  And what am I going to do when I'm out on the lake?
[00:06:20.106 --> 00:06:21.868]  Now the whole vacation is ruined.
[00:06:22.068 --> 00:06:22.989]  Honey, cheer up.
[00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:25.593]  I brought our Sport Berkey Purifiers.
[00:06:25.873 --> 00:06:26.194]  What?
[00:06:26.614 --> 00:06:37.089]  Yeah, I know you're picky about not having pathogenic bacteria, organic chemicals, heavy metals or foul tastes and odors in the water, so I packed our Sport Berkey Purifiers.
[00:06:37.389 --> 00:06:37.630]  You know?
[00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:40.593]  This is a terrific cabin, and wow!
[00:06:40.813 --> 00:06:42.255]  Have you noticed the beautiful weather?
[00:06:42.535 --> 00:06:43.736]  Don't ruin your vacation.

[00:06:47.941 --> 00:06:49.322]  Travel Berkey, now available in Iowa.
[00:07:00.529 --> 00:07:05.372]  The Japanese have used magnetic therapy for thousands of years, and it's more popular today than ever before.
[00:07:05.612 --> 00:07:13.876]  Established in 2000, Arizona Unipol Magnetics, AUM, is the number one online source for the superb Dr. Philpott approved Kohler Power Magnetics.
[00:07:14.216 --> 00:07:18.318]  Now offering a complete line of these fine magnetics in an easy to read mail order catalog.
[00:07:18.518 --> 00:07:21.700]  No hyped up product descriptions to waste your time, just the facts.
[00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:29.444]  Unique polar-powered magnetics are designed to apply only the negative magnetic field to the body, and they're the only magnetics used in Dr. Philpott's research.
[00:07:29.604 --> 00:07:37.608]  Proven safe with over 23 years of documented research, now GCN listeners can order the polar-powered ceramic block biomagnet and get a discount.
[00:07:37.728 --> 00:07:39.849]  This is the workhorse of all biomagnets.
[00:07:40.109 --> 00:07:41.990]  Just mention GCN when you place your order.
[00:07:42.251 --> 00:07:44.372]  Visit azunimags.com.
[00:07:44.712 --> 00:07:48.674]  That's A-Z-U-N, as in North, I-M-A-G-S,
[00:07:48.974 --> 00:07:49.254]  That's 888-442-0449.
[00:07:49.274 --> 00:07:52.757]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:07:52.777 --> 00:07:54.878]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:18.248 --> 00:08:19.890]  We're going to take a lot of calls today.
[00:08:19.950 --> 00:08:30.779]  Greg Palast, American, who works for the BBC, ABC News, and the London Guardian, reports for all three of those outlets, will be joining us with analysis.
[00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:43.210]  I also want to get Bev Harris of Black Box Voting to pop in, riding high on the success of her big HBO special, to give us her analysis on the election fraud we saw coast-to-coast.
[00:08:44.378 --> 00:08:48.319]  And let's attempt to try to unspin the spin we've witnessed.
[00:08:48.879 --> 00:08:52.180]  Laura Ingraham openly saying, jam Democratic helplines.
[00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:54.720]  That is racketeering, by the way.
[00:08:54.800 --> 00:09:09.323]  You can tell people to call on your talk show, the Congress or the President or even private businesses, but when you start trying to frustrate and block people's capacity to vote, I know that violates several federal laws.
[00:09:09.403 --> 00:09:11.504]  It just shows how dirty these people operate.
[00:09:11.544 --> 00:09:12.664]  But despite the fact...
[00:09:13.266 --> 00:09:13.807]  We're good to go.
[00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:38.002]  But the New World Order has stopgap measures.
[00:09:38.122 --> 00:09:54.334]  Not only were they defeated here in their attempt to steal the election yet again, it doesn't matter because then their second string just comes in, led by the Queen, gun control, open border promoting, one world government pushing, Nancy Pelosi.
[00:09:54.374 --> 00:09:57.036]  So now the Queen Bee is on the job.
[00:09:58.542 --> 00:10:06.006]  And I talked to a lot of delusional Democrats a few weeks ago when she was on 60 Minutes, saying, oh, don't worry, I'm not going to move to impeach George Bush.
[00:10:06.026 --> 00:10:07.766]  We're going to block any impeachment moves.
[00:10:08.067 --> 00:10:09.887]  We're going to work with him in partnership.
[00:10:10.328 --> 00:10:13.849]  And a lot of delusional Democrats said, oh, no, she's just saying that.
[00:10:14.310 --> 00:10:15.690]  Wait till she wins.
[00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:17.751]  Oh, we love her.
[00:10:18.051 --> 00:10:19.592]  Take our guns, Nancy.
[00:10:19.932 --> 00:10:21.593]  Get rid of America, Nancy.
[00:10:21.933 --> 00:10:23.534]  Save us from evil Bush.
[00:10:24.969 --> 00:10:25.570]  We're good to go.
[00:10:47.643 --> 00:10:50.125]  And so, you've got some good Democrats that got in.
[00:10:50.145 --> 00:10:51.647]  I want to go over all those numbers.
[00:10:52.167 --> 00:10:56.091]  Libertarians caused the loss of Republicans all over the country.
[00:10:56.431 --> 00:10:57.252]  Wonderful news.
[00:10:57.412 --> 00:10:58.133]  Good job.
[00:10:58.533 --> 00:11:02.056]  These traitorous, open-border, gun-control Republicans.
[00:11:02.136 --> 00:11:04.439]  Oh, they give speeches about being pro-gun.
[00:11:04.699 --> 00:11:08.863]  They give speeches about being pro-border while voting for total amnesty.
[00:11:09.163 --> 00:11:12.186]  At least we now have wicked Democrats.
[00:11:12.967 --> 00:11:17.672]  Wolves actively out trying to rend the underbelly of this country.
[00:11:17.772 --> 00:11:19.393]  Now we can identify them.
[00:11:20.334 --> 00:11:31.967]  Now we can mobilize conservatives and take them out of their mind-numb stupor, myopically Hare Krishna-ing George Bush as they chant over and over again, Hail Bush!
[00:11:32.007 --> 00:11:33.128]  Hail world government!
[00:11:33.368 --> 00:11:34.549]  Hail open borders!
[00:11:35.050 --> 00:11:41.676]  Now you'll be forced to face what this unified government in partnership has been doing.
[00:11:42.017 --> 00:11:46.881]  There's been a partnership between the Republicans and the Democrats against the American people.
[00:11:48.062 --> 00:11:52.627]  By the way, speaking of the devil, were you able to get that clip of Pelosi earlier today?
[00:11:54.824 --> 00:11:56.306]  Okay, we're downloading it right now.
[00:11:56.326 --> 00:11:57.648]  A little bit of network congestion.
[00:11:57.688 --> 00:11:58.889]  I just gave him the club a few minutes ago.
[00:11:58.929 --> 00:11:59.410]  He's getting it.
[00:11:59.951 --> 00:12:01.593]  And then she's giving another speech right now.
[00:12:01.633 --> 00:12:02.875]  We're grabbing that for you, too.
[00:12:02.915 --> 00:12:08.081]  We'll be playing some of it because Target Pelosi, this is now the new enemy.
[00:12:08.942 --> 00:12:11.566]  Nancy Pelosi is, you should hate her.
[00:12:12.213 --> 00:12:14.054]  The no-bid contracts, the Enron connections...
[00:12:42.262 --> 00:12:42.694]  All of it.
[00:12:43.929 --> 00:12:46.411]  We could have huge hearings.
[00:12:46.451 --> 00:12:54.436]  We could see George Bush waving by on the helicopter and flying out to his Hollywood set in Crawford, just north of me, here in Central Texas.
[00:12:54.796 --> 00:12:56.677]  We could witness them going to prison.
[00:12:56.958 --> 00:12:58.379]  We could bust it wide open.
[00:12:58.579 --> 00:12:59.699]  But that isn't going to happen.
[00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:12.408]  Just like George Bush protected Bill Clinton, first thing he did was block Dan Burton's committee, Congressman Burton's committee, going after George Bush, George Bush's little agent, Bill Clinton, company man.
[00:13:13.496 --> 00:13:14.098]  We're good to go.
[00:13:22.248 --> 00:13:24.909]  Chinese spies in the White House and the rest of it.
[00:13:25.009 --> 00:13:27.550]  The first thing that they protect each other.
[00:13:27.850 --> 00:13:36.973]  Oh, they fight over who gets to run things and over who gets to be in the management job of the CEO of Slavery Incorporated, as I said in the film Waking Life.
[00:13:37.494 --> 00:13:42.675]  But at the end of the day, they work together.
[00:13:43.156 --> 00:13:45.016]  They work together against who?
[00:13:45.296 --> 00:13:46.757]  Who are they in partnership against?
[00:13:47.017 --> 00:13:48.097]  The American people.
[00:13:48.458 --> 00:13:49.678]  Nancy Pelosi.
[00:13:50.660 --> 00:14:06.614]  Queen Bee of the New World Order, Speaker of the House, to be christened very soon, to be anointed, to be brought in as our Lordship, in partnership with the slimy neocons, led by a bunch of Democrats like Hillary...
[00:14:07.154 --> 00:14:16.977]  And Schumer and Lieberman saying they want to attack Iran, and they want more troops in Iraq, and they want to go into Lebanon, and they want to go into Syria.
[00:14:17.197 --> 00:14:29.081]  So let's see if Democrats, who started to wake up in this country now, just go back to sleep because they've got the sugar tit that they can stick in their mouth of the Democratic Party being in power.
[00:14:30.603 --> 00:14:32.244]  And again, that is not a profane term.
[00:14:32.604 --> 00:14:36.966]  That's the name of the pacifiers they would give babies.
[00:14:37.386 --> 00:14:41.207]  It's a handkerchief with a sugar cube wrapped in it.
[00:14:41.287 --> 00:14:43.848]  You just give that to the baby and it'll shut up.
[00:14:44.569 --> 00:14:45.049]  Oh, here.
[00:14:45.409 --> 00:14:48.250]  Here's your little sugar pacifier.
[00:14:48.710 --> 00:14:49.991]  Stick this in your mouth.
[00:14:50.431 --> 00:14:51.111]  Shut up.
[00:14:51.491 --> 00:14:52.732]  Everything's okay now.
[00:14:55.238 --> 00:14:56.999]  Oh, Nancy Pelosi.
[00:14:57.059 --> 00:14:58.459]  She makes me sick.
[00:14:58.660 --> 00:15:04.242]  Here she is this morning saying she's going to be in partnership with the gracious Lord Bush.
[00:15:05.182 --> 00:15:08.864]  Tonight is a great victory for the American people.
[00:15:13.505 --> 00:15:21.949]  Today, the American people voted for change and they voted for Democrats to take our country in a new direction.
[00:15:27.017 --> 00:15:30.579]  And that is exactly what we intend to do.
[00:15:34.220 --> 00:15:42.584]  The American people voted for a new direction to restore civility and bipartisanship in Washington, DC.
[00:15:46.105 --> 00:15:52.928]  And Democrats promised to work together in a bipartisan way for all Americans.
[00:15:55.805 --> 00:16:03.012]  The American people voted to restore integrity and honesty in Washington, D.C.
[00:16:05.514 --> 00:16:14.302]  And the Democrats intend to lead the most honest, most open and most ethical Congress in history.
[00:16:21.232 --> 00:16:26.373]  The American people voted for a new direction for a fairer economy.
[00:16:28.233 --> 00:16:37.255]  And Democrats intend to work for an economy where all Americans participate in the prosperity of our great country.
[00:16:42.296 --> 00:16:50.718]  And nowhere did the American people make it more clear that we need a new direction than in the war in Iraq.
[00:16:55.299 --> 00:17:07.283]  To say the course has not made our country safer, has not honored our commitment to our troops, and has not made the region more stable.
[00:17:09.984 --> 00:17:14.206]  We cannot continue down this catastrophic path.
[00:17:15.806 --> 00:17:22.769]  And so we say to the President, Mr. President, we need a new direction in Iraq.
[00:17:30.012 --> 00:17:36.235]  Let us work together to find a solution to the war in Iraq.
[00:17:41.178 --> 00:17:42.639]  The campaign is over.
[00:17:43.999 --> 00:17:46.661]  Democrats are ready to lead.
[00:17:52.524 --> 00:17:54.805]  We are prepared to govern.
[00:17:56.966 --> 00:17:58.207]  And we will do so
[00:17:58.863 --> 00:18:06.729]  Working together with the administration and the Republicans in Congress in partnership, not in partisanship.
[00:18:12.513 --> 00:18:22.820]  As Senator Reid said today all across the country, in the North and the South and the East and the West, from my city of San Francisco to...
[00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:34.985]  From sea to shining sea, the American people voted for change.
[00:18:39.768 --> 00:18:42.250]  They want us to do things differently.
[00:18:42.270 --> 00:18:43.031]  All right.
[00:18:43.191 --> 00:18:48.415]  And we, the Democrats... So basically, oh, we need change in Iraq, and what have the Democrats said?
[00:18:48.435 --> 00:18:51.257]  Not 20,000 more, 40,000 more troops.
[00:18:52.057 --> 00:18:52.858]  You want change?
[00:18:52.938 --> 00:18:53.859]  Let's hit Iran.
[00:18:54.619 --> 00:18:58.182]  We're going to work in partnership with George Bush, not in partisanship.
[00:19:00.385 --> 00:19:04.366]  And Nancy Pelosi said no impeachment hearings, no investigations of Bush.
[00:19:04.906 --> 00:19:06.906]  They're just going to let the status quo continue.
[00:19:06.926 --> 00:19:10.367]  They're going to leave the Patriot Act in, the Military Commissions Act.
[00:19:10.647 --> 00:19:15.248]  They're going to leave the defense authorization subsections in, abolishing posse commentatus.
[00:19:16.688 --> 00:19:29.311]  How do you now feel, Republicans out there that supported the end of posse commentatus, that supported Bush erasing the control governors had, who supported secret arrest and secret execution and torture of American citizens?
[00:19:30.362 --> 00:19:33.284]  Now you're going to get the Democrats in the House and probably the Senate.
[00:19:34.204 --> 00:19:36.345]  Now you're going to get the Democrats in the presidency.
[00:19:36.986 --> 00:19:38.567]  And they're going to start arresting us.
[00:19:38.587 --> 00:19:43.009]  And they're going to send out the new expanded VATF to take our guns.
[00:19:44.790 --> 00:19:47.932]  And hell, as long as they attack the Arabs, you'll probably support it, won't you?
[00:19:48.592 --> 00:19:49.373]  Because you're scum.
[00:19:50.518 --> 00:19:52.039]  So let's see what you do, Democrats.
[00:19:52.059 --> 00:19:54.981]  You're going to try to get this whore, Nancy Pelosi, out of there?
[00:19:55.001 --> 00:19:58.724]  You're going to let this whore, to the New World Order, destroy this country?
[00:19:59.064 --> 00:20:00.105]  Protect George Bush?
[00:20:01.346 --> 00:20:02.407]  Ted Anderson from Midas.
[00:20:02.447 --> 00:20:03.187]  Today is November 8, 2006.
[00:20:03.327 --> 00:20:07.010]  Gold opened at $6.23, and one-ounce gold coins can be purchased for $6.49.74 and $3.25.38 for half-ounce coins.
[00:20:07.050 --> 00:20:07.491]  That's $6.49.74 and $3.25.38.
[00:20:16.577 --> 00:20:29.284]  On June 4th, 1963, an unknown presidential decree, Executive Order 11110, was signed with the authority to strip the Federal Reserve Bank of its power to lend money to the United States government and interest.
[00:20:29.724 --> 00:20:32.906]  With the stroke of a pen, Kennedy would have put the Fed out of business.
[00:20:33.226 --> 00:20:35.947]  If you're interested in breaking the bondage of taxation and debt, call 800-686-2237.
[00:20:35.967 --> 00:20:36.167]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:21:01.804 --> 00:21:04.205]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:21:04.245 --> 00:21:15.829]  Did you know that a semi-secret organization called the Council on Foreign Relations was founded in 1921 by Marxist Colonel Edward Mandel House, who was a personal advisor to President Woodrow Wilson?
[00:21:16.569 --> 00:21:21.911]  Its objective was to capture the foreign policy section of the State Department to help direct U.S.
[00:21:21.971 --> 00:21:25.752]  influence in the overthrow of targeted nations for communism.
[00:21:26.636 --> 00:21:27.036]  We're good to go.
[00:21:45.807 --> 00:21:47.268]  Just call our toll-free number 1-800-516-8736.
[00:21:47.288 --> 00:21:47.608]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[00:21:47.628 --> 00:21:50.009]  Operators are standing by to receive your call.

[00:22:59.078 --> 00:23:06.784]  Do you know the truth about breast cancer?
[00:23:07.304 --> 00:23:09.726]  Do you realize that the race for the cure is over?
[00:23:10.507 --> 00:23:18.933]  The best-kept secret in the world today is that now it's possible to kill cancer without personal suffering, mutilation, and poisoning of your entire system.
[00:23:19.893 --> 00:23:24.757]  Now it's cancer's turn to die with LaysMed Incorporated's patented methodology.

[00:23:35.905 --> 00:23:38.207]  Star War technology at its best.

[00:23:48.971 --> 00:23:55.146]  Or visit www.lazemedinc.com That's www.lazemedinc.com
[00:24:06.428 --> 00:24:07.529]  Welcome back.
[00:24:07.589 --> 00:24:08.690]  Alex Jones here live.
[00:24:08.750 --> 00:24:09.390]  It is November 8, 2006.
[00:24:09.711 --> 00:24:13.393]  We're covering the aftermath of Election 2006.
[00:24:13.834 --> 00:24:19.558]  Two Senate seats still in the balance, tipping towards Democrats in Montana and, of course, in Virginia.
[00:24:19.578 --> 00:24:21.119]  We'll tell you more about that.
[00:24:21.179 --> 00:24:23.521]  And I don't mean that Nancy Pelosi is a physical whore.
[00:24:23.621 --> 00:24:30.827]  I mean she's a whore to the New World Order, bought and paid for by the globalists, protecting George Bush's traitorous backside.
[00:24:31.798 --> 00:24:35.740]  And she's saying no impeachment, no going after him, no hearings, no nothing.
[00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:38.681]  Partnership, just as we thought.
[00:24:39.621 --> 00:24:40.741]  And it's sick.
[00:24:40.801 --> 00:24:45.023]  We're going to go to your calls, and I'll get more into these two contested races.
[00:24:45.063 --> 00:24:46.604]  Will the Democrats get the Senate?
[00:24:47.184 --> 00:24:49.025]  Nicholas in France, welcome.
[00:24:50.605 --> 00:24:51.085]  Hi, Alex.
[00:24:51.345 --> 00:24:51.665]  Hello.
[00:24:52.626 --> 00:24:52.866]  Great.
[00:24:52.966 --> 00:25:00.989]  So a lot of people are afraid to vote for the candidate they actually want, the candidate who best represents their views, because they feel they have to vote for the lesser of two evils.
[00:25:01.761 --> 00:25:08.807]  And I want to know what do you think of systems like instant runoff voting or other alternative voting systems?
[00:25:08.827 --> 00:25:09.808]  Do you think that could work?
[00:25:10.128 --> 00:25:11.129]  Do you think it's possible to
[00:25:13.079 --> 00:25:27.288]  I believe in our constitutional system, and some of the European parliamentary systems are even easier for them to manipulate and to ensure that minority elites are able to stay in control.
[00:25:27.408 --> 00:25:42.098]  Some of what we see in England, the Labour Party has a minority of the seats, but there's so many parties that they're still able to maintain control, and they work with the Tories really to team up and just fool the people with the illusion of choice.
[00:25:42.888 --> 00:25:45.249]  And certainly we don't even have a two-party system in this country.
[00:25:45.309 --> 00:25:50.991]  We have one party, the, you know, the Republicans, and that's the big problem here.
[00:25:51.851 --> 00:25:55.553]  And it's good to, you know, make sure that Bush didn't have all three branches of government.
[00:25:56.413 --> 00:25:58.834]  The problem is, is that he really still does.
[00:25:58.854 --> 00:26:02.355]  It's just a power sharing with a Democratic arm right now.
[00:26:02.875 --> 00:26:04.696]  So I don't think our system's gone wrong.
[00:26:04.776 --> 00:26:07.397]  Our system has been supplanted and hijacked.
[00:26:10.663 --> 00:26:11.383]  That's my take on it.
[00:26:11.403 --> 00:26:12.864]  You got comments from France, Nicholas?
[00:26:14.765 --> 00:26:16.746]  No, I have to think about it more.
[00:26:16.786 --> 00:26:19.888]  I want to tell you that I thought bucket of traitorness was very funny.
[00:26:21.468 --> 00:26:22.049]  Well, thank you.
[00:26:22.849 --> 00:26:23.269]  What did I say?
[00:26:23.329 --> 00:26:23.950]  Bucket of what?
[00:26:25.090 --> 00:26:25.610]  Traitorness.
[00:26:26.051 --> 00:26:26.791]  Yes, traitorness.
[00:26:26.851 --> 00:26:28.572]  A new word I've invented.
[00:26:29.512 --> 00:26:30.032]  Well, thank you.
[00:26:30.052 --> 00:26:31.393]  So you're an American living in France?
[00:26:32.334 --> 00:26:33.114]  Yes, yeah.
[00:26:33.634 --> 00:26:34.295]  What do you do over there?
[00:26:34.315 --> 00:26:34.915]  Teach school?
[00:26:34.935 --> 00:26:39.297]  Yeah, I teach English and I study linguistics over at the Sorbonne.
[00:26:40.223 --> 00:26:50.773]  The only reason I knew that is because usually somebody calls from China or Japan or Germany or France or even Mexico and they're in America and they usually are teaching something.
[00:26:50.813 --> 00:26:56.339]  Well, how are the French handling the eve of the Muslim riots?
[00:26:57.900 --> 00:27:05.187]  Well, I talk to a lot of my students about all of these issues because they're interested in talking about what's going on and we bring it up and
[00:27:05.953 --> 00:27:08.355]  Well, they're not as informed as you would expect.
[00:27:08.435 --> 00:27:18.941]  I talk to a lot of people who are in business positions because they have to learn English because they work for SMCF or some important company in France, and they're not as informed as you might believe.
[00:27:19.422 --> 00:27:22.724]  I often try to form a class around, you know, talking about
[00:27:24.184 --> 00:27:27.565]  Exactly.
[00:27:27.805 --> 00:27:30.126]  We've got to continue the education process.
[00:27:30.386 --> 00:27:31.406]  Nicholas, thanks for the call.
[00:27:31.466 --> 00:27:32.367]  Another foreign call.
[00:27:32.747 --> 00:27:35.087]  Andrew in the land down under Australia.
[00:27:35.447 --> 00:27:36.088]  Welcome, sir.
[00:27:37.048 --> 00:27:37.928]  Yes, Alex.
[00:27:37.988 --> 00:27:39.168]  Great to talk to you again, mate.
[00:27:39.328 --> 00:27:40.889]  I just had a question for you tonight.
[00:27:41.209 --> 00:27:48.151]  And that is, do you think that perhaps... We've seen the Democratic landslide reported all over the Australian press.
[00:27:48.683 --> 00:28:03.466]  And do you think that this is possibly a set-up for 2008, ensuring that both upper and lower houses are loaded with Democrats, so therefore in 2008 they can bring forth a Democratic president?
[00:28:03.606 --> 00:28:14.987]  Yes, it's very, very dangerous, but depending on who the establishment puts forward, owning both fighters in the ballot, frankly it'll probably be better just to have a pure, evil Democrat in.
[00:28:15.368 --> 00:28:17.928]  That way the majority of Americans who are conservative
[00:28:18.408 --> 00:28:19.049]  We're good to go.
[00:28:36.602 --> 00:28:37.403]  We're good to go.
[00:29:07.581 --> 00:29:08.382]  Right, okay.
[00:29:08.462 --> 00:29:13.347]  And do you see that there was any voting fraud in this particular election?
[00:29:13.367 --> 00:29:14.107]  Massive.
[00:29:14.147 --> 00:29:24.838]  It would have been an even bigger Democratic takeover, but Republican-controlled voting machine companies in 35% of the country did steal elections in a lot of key areas, the evidence shows.
[00:29:25.158 --> 00:29:27.260]  Bev Harris, an expert on it, joins us in the next hour.
[00:29:27.660 --> 00:29:29.102]  Greg Palast joins us in the next hour.
[00:29:29.682 --> 00:29:35.445]  Do you think perhaps that the voting fraud could have been slanted the other way towards the Democrats?
[00:29:35.625 --> 00:29:37.026]  A lot of people are saying that.
[00:29:37.066 --> 00:29:38.647]  I'll give you my take on it on the other side.
[00:29:38.967 --> 00:29:39.968]  Continue with phone calls.
[00:29:39.988 --> 00:29:44.110]  We'll also look at the races in the Senate.
[00:29:44.470 --> 00:29:46.011]  And will the Democrats be getting the Senate?
[00:29:46.031 --> 00:29:47.332]  We'll find out in the next few hours.
[00:29:47.572 --> 00:29:48.032]  Stay with us.
[00:29:51.654 --> 00:29:52.715]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.055 --> 00:29:54.656]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.576 --> 00:29:58.258]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.949 --> 00:30:04.291]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here with an important question.
[00:30:04.531 --> 00:30:06.572]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[00:30:06.732 --> 00:30:13.756]  I mean real hard to find all natural pure soap that contains no dyes, perfumes, deodorants, detergents, or other dangerous toxins.
[00:30:14.037 --> 00:30:22.622]  The Calvin Pure Soap Company, for the past 57 years, has been making triple concentrated pure soaps exclusively for healthcare professionals and hospitals.
[00:30:22.942 --> 00:30:27.626]  Now for the first time, Calvin Pure Soap is available factory direct to you and your family.
[00:30:27.766 --> 00:30:34.450]  That's great news because Calvin Pure Soap is made from all natural ingredients, is earth-friendly, and completely environmentally safe.
[00:30:34.631 --> 00:30:38.974]  So if you want yesterday's values today for good old-fashioned pure soap, call 1-800-340-7091.
[00:30:42.196 --> 00:30:43.056]  You'll never use anything else.
[00:31:01.488 --> 00:31:03.329]  Dad, can we stop?
[00:31:03.669 --> 00:31:05.190]  We need to go to the bathroom.
[00:31:05.610 --> 00:31:05.850]  What?
[00:31:06.210 --> 00:31:06.590]  Again?
[00:31:06.990 --> 00:31:08.611]  We just stopped two hours ago.
[00:31:08.691 --> 00:31:13.113]  Honey, let's stop, because I gave the kids their spark-burkey water bottles.
[00:31:13.353 --> 00:31:14.634]  Why did you do that?
[00:31:14.834 --> 00:31:20.636]  Because they can't drink and talk at the same time, and that way we don't have to listen to them singing, Are we there yet?
[00:31:20.936 --> 00:31:21.957]  Are we there yet?
[00:31:22.057 --> 00:31:23.137]  for the entire trip.
[00:31:23.377 --> 00:31:25.578]  Hmm, I didn't think about that.
[00:31:26.058 --> 00:31:27.079]  Great idea.
[00:31:27.359 --> 00:31:29.920]  Yeah, and it's cheap entertainment for the kids.
[00:31:30.300 --> 00:31:32.762]  Bottled water costs around 75 cents a bottle.
[00:31:32.962 --> 00:31:37.365]  And using our Berkey Sport bottles, it costs us less than two and a half cents per refill.
[00:31:37.646 --> 00:31:37.946]  Honey!
[00:31:38.775 --> 00:31:40.015]  You're terrific!
[00:31:40.416 --> 00:31:41.896]  Oh, honey, so are you.
[00:31:42.016 --> 00:31:45.417]  You're the one that bought the family our sport Berkey water bottles.
[00:31:45.697 --> 00:31:46.497]  Now, can we stop?
[00:31:46.978 --> 00:31:47.718]  I need to go, too.
[00:31:48.018 --> 00:31:52.459]  Get your Berkey Sport Purification Bottle for only $39 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:31:52.519 --> 00:31:52.819]  That's 888-803-4438.

[00:32:01.849 --> 00:32:04.251]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network.
[00:32:04.771 --> 00:32:08.073]  Let's ask the question that the Bush regime hopes you will never ask.
[00:32:08.453 --> 00:32:11.395]  That is, is the USA already bankrupt?
[00:32:11.675 --> 00:32:18.059]  As the world's biggest debtor nation, we are borrowing in excess of 80% of the world's net savings.
[00:32:18.119 --> 00:32:22.522]  That's $2 billion per day to finance the biggest deficit in history.
[00:32:22.762 --> 00:32:27.124]  Our creditors are becoming increasingly concerned that the debt can never be repaid.
[00:32:27.285 --> 00:32:32.687]  Japan and China, two of the largest holders of US debt, are looking to greatly reduce their exposure to dollars.
[00:32:33.148 --> 00:32:40.872]  In fact, China has privately hinted that a US attack on Iran could result in China's dumping massive amounts of US treasury bonds.
[00:32:41.152 --> 00:32:45.795]  To find out more about this, call for a free report on the coming dollar collapse.
[00:32:45.955 --> 00:32:47.596]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.
[00:32:47.616 --> 00:32:49.797]  That's 1-888-8XANADU or 1-888-8XANADU and ask for George.
[00:33:09.687 --> 00:33:18.330]  This is not America.
[00:33:18.990 --> 00:33:22.712]  Little peace, son.
[00:33:23.052 --> 00:33:24.812]  Our little peace indeed.
[00:33:25.993 --> 00:33:28.994]  We'll die a miracle.
[00:33:30.374 --> 00:33:33.135]  Oh, this is not America.
[00:33:33.355 --> 00:33:38.317]  Blossom hills bloom the seasons.
[00:33:44.742 --> 00:33:46.243]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:33:46.263 --> 00:33:50.264]  Lloyd, Michael, Joe, and many others are going to be going to your calls here in just a few minutes.
[00:33:50.284 --> 00:33:59.188]  The toll-free number to join us, wide-open phones throughout the entire three hours of transmission against tyranny from deep in the heart of the geographical location in Texas, 1-800-259-9231, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:34:07.555 --> 00:34:13.742]  I want to also keep your comments short and to the point, your questions, your comments, your statements, because I want to give everybody a chance to get involved.
[00:34:14.022 --> 00:34:16.685]  Greg Palast will be riding shotgun with us in the second hour.
[00:34:17.065 --> 00:34:24.253]  Bev Harris, 20 minutes into the second hour, will be popping in with an update on key election fraud around the country and some other breaking news.
[00:34:25.033 --> 00:34:42.999]  And we also have Aaron Russo joining us in the third hour to give us his take on what's happening with the election and also some of the censorship he's been dealing with with American freedom to fascism and what's happening to actor Wesley Snipes, who he's in personal contact with, who's had to leave the country because they're trying to arrest him.
[00:34:43.299 --> 00:34:46.800]  The New York Times reporting no deal made to free actor in tax case.
[00:34:46.820 --> 00:34:48.981]  Prosecutors said, I knew he was in tax trouble.
[00:34:49.001 --> 00:34:52.602]  I didn't know Wesley Snipes was a patriot who knows all about the New World Order, but he
[00:34:52.842 --> 00:34:57.525]  I found out just by talking to Aaron yesterday that he's friends with him and he knows about his situation.
[00:34:57.565 --> 00:35:01.988]  So we'll be talking a little bit about that in the third hour with Aaron Russo as well.
[00:35:02.068 --> 00:35:11.134]  Also here in Austin, Texas at Steiner Elementary School, a young man, a fifth grader, ten years old, a couple days ago last week.
[00:35:11.255 --> 00:35:12.575]  I learned about this on Monday.
[00:35:12.976 --> 00:35:14.737]  We've since vetted and confirmed the story.
[00:35:15.516 --> 00:35:22.725]  I was in his computer lab and simply visited CIA.gov and some other sites trying to find out about Mohammad Mosaddegh and U.S.
[00:35:22.745 --> 00:35:23.786]  government-sponsored terror.
[00:35:24.387 --> 00:35:25.248]  A child declared...
[00:35:26.915 --> 00:35:28.356]  Denounced him as a terrorist.
[00:35:28.757 --> 00:35:32.540]  He was called to the head of the classroom, said he was going to terrorist websites.
[00:35:33.100 --> 00:35:38.144]  The teacher chastised him, sent him to the principal, who told him he couldn't visit those sites and that he would be reprimanded.
[00:35:38.785 --> 00:35:39.806]  And this is America.
[00:35:40.106 --> 00:35:41.407]  Of course, this is not America.
[00:35:41.427 --> 00:35:41.988]  It shouldn't be.
[00:35:42.048 --> 00:35:46.491]  But this is part and parcel of everything else we're facing and dealing with.
[00:35:46.511 --> 00:35:54.558]  Whether firing professors, arresting citizens, national talk show hosts like Laura Ingraham and Sean Hannity are calling for 9-11 truthers' arrest.
[00:35:55.439 --> 00:35:58.462]  I mean, they're trying to play hardball, but we're not backing off.
[00:35:58.502 --> 00:36:01.804]  We're standing up strong, and they're not about to try to start arresting us.
[00:36:02.064 --> 00:36:03.485]  They're not going to get away with what they've done.
[00:36:03.525 --> 00:36:06.067]  They want to defend a bunch of terrorists who carried out 9-11.
[00:36:06.147 --> 00:36:07.488]  We're going to expose them.
[00:36:09.310 --> 00:36:16.235]  But before I go any further with your calls, let me just comment on what the listener was asking about.
[00:36:16.255 --> 00:36:19.378]  And my office was saying this last night.
[00:36:19.398 --> 00:36:21.519]  We were getting calls about this here at the office last night.
[00:36:21.619 --> 00:36:22.220]  We were here until...
[00:36:23.775 --> 00:36:30.419]  About 11 o'clock, tracking the election, and we were saying, well, you know, could they be stealing it for the Democrats?
[00:36:31.120 --> 00:36:50.472]  And yes, I mean, if electronic voting machines are government-controlled and controlled by those private corporations, and we know they've been designed for fraud, again, their own engineers, their own employees going public, that's in the back of the paper, but it's admitted, then you can't, you don't know how they're stealing it, generally, you just know they are stealing it.
[00:36:51.673 --> 00:36:53.054]  And you know it's not trustworthy.
[00:36:54.043 --> 00:37:06.153]  But from past actions, the reason I don't think they were stealing, and in most areas, most congressional districts in the country, for favor of Democrats, is because in the past, these companies have been pioneers.
[00:37:06.213 --> 00:37:10.297]  That means they raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for Bush and the Republicans.
[00:37:10.857 --> 00:37:14.180]  That's what they call that grade of the highest level of contributor.
[00:37:16.186 --> 00:37:22.648]  They have been systematically blocking Democratic victories in the last two congressional elections, 2002, 2004.
[00:37:23.128 --> 00:37:34.411]  And, you know, the head of Diebold said, I will deliver the electoral votes of Ohio to the Republican Party in a statement.
[00:37:34.731 --> 00:37:40.553]  I mean, they're pretty bold in their arrogant-laced hubris.
[00:37:41.613 --> 00:37:44.314]  Their arrogance-laced hubris in a plum.
[00:37:44.932 --> 00:37:45.512]  We're good to go.
[00:37:45.533 --> 00:37:45.733]  I think?
[00:38:04.213 --> 00:38:17.496]  But again, 35% of the country, and that's the number I've been going with according to the Help America Vote Act numbers I have, the federally funded money to put in these fraudulent machines that we know are run by companies stealing elections.
[00:38:17.816 --> 00:38:26.078]  And the AP did report yesterday that, quote, around a little over one-third of the country is voting on the, quote, new special machines.
[00:38:26.419 --> 00:38:27.999]  So that number is still accurate.
[00:38:28.639 --> 00:38:31.800]  I was told it may have grown up to 40%, but right now it's still just 35%.
[00:38:34.002 --> 00:38:35.523]  A little above a third at 33.3.
[00:38:37.825 --> 00:38:48.273]  So, just from the data we have, it looks like they blocked a massive, ultra-massive Democratic takeover of the Senate.
[00:38:48.533 --> 00:38:51.135]  The Democrats may still narrowly get it with, say, 50-50.
[00:38:51.276 --> 00:38:52.817]  I mean, it's at 49-49.
[00:38:52.837 --> 00:38:54.138]  Let me actually get to the numbers here.
[00:38:58.829 --> 00:39:15.696]  It's at 49-49 right now with a race in Montana for the Senate and a race in Virginia with Democrats leading in both of those states by one point as of about five minutes ago, six minutes ago when I was watching CNN and getting print-offs here.
[00:39:16.217 --> 00:39:19.698]  Fox News is reporting that the Democrats will win the Senate.
[00:39:20.282 --> 00:39:22.444]  Does Fox News know something the rest of us don't?
[00:39:22.864 --> 00:39:24.065]  With three races in the U.S.
[00:39:24.105 --> 00:39:37.416]  Senate still too close to call, Fox News awarded control of the chamber to the Democratic Party early today in a story headlined, Democrats Take Control of House, Need Three More Seats in Senate, posted by FoxNews.com.
[00:39:37.897 --> 00:39:47.385]  Liza Portuis promoted Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada to Senate Majority Leader,
[00:39:48.323 --> 00:39:56.129]  Americans all over America tonight have said, we want change, added the new Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada.
[00:39:56.149 --> 00:39:57.089]  That's what Fox News said.
[00:39:57.430 --> 00:40:03.234]  Americans have come to the conclusion, as we did months ago, that we must change direction in Iraq.
[00:40:04.134 --> 00:40:11.600]  The story also refers to Nancy Pelosi as the new Speaker of the House, but other news organizations also have predicted the Democrats will control that chamber.
[00:40:11.900 --> 00:40:13.421]  And they have a huge,
[00:40:14.301 --> 00:40:17.163]  Right now, the House is 227 reporting as Democrat wins to 195.
[00:40:17.243 --> 00:40:21.747]  So, my friends, that is a massive, massive win.
[00:40:39.661 --> 00:40:45.964]  Majority right now of 30-plus sheets in the House.
[00:40:46.004 --> 00:40:48.866]  I guess that would be 32 sheets right now.
[00:40:50.572 --> 00:40:55.274]  And then in the Senate, it's Republican 49, Democrat 49, two undecided.
[00:40:55.334 --> 00:41:08.921]  And they're saying now that with both Democrats a point ahead, I don't know how they could announce with some precincts still not fully reported in, they haven't counted all the votes yet, how do they say that Republicans have lost when it's so close?
[00:41:08.941 --> 00:41:15.945]  But again, they're reporting that it looks like the Democrats will take the House and the Senate.
[00:41:16.385 --> 00:41:17.886]  I will tell you, though, that
[00:41:18.772 --> 00:41:20.354]  I don't know what the answer is on this.
[00:41:20.534 --> 00:41:23.377]  I'm not one of these talk show hosts that always claims I have the answer.
[00:41:23.697 --> 00:41:30.643]  We know the big four voting machine companies, one owned by Clear Channel, the other is owned by big Republicans, in the past stealing elections.
[00:41:31.324 --> 00:41:37.730]  We know it involved other nefarious activities, skewing, manipulating, spinning.
[00:41:38.791 --> 00:41:41.734]  We know that in the past they've been giving it to Republicans that didn't deserve it.
[00:41:42.970 --> 00:41:43.891]  We're good to go.
[00:42:12.662 --> 00:42:14.223]  And a lot of analysts were openly saying that.
[00:42:14.963 --> 00:42:17.244]  Not just in mainstream media, but here on this broadcast.
[00:42:18.145 --> 00:42:24.008]  So it looks like Republicans did try to steal some seats to blunt a total takeover.
[00:42:24.068 --> 00:42:25.849]  It looks like they failed.
[00:42:25.929 --> 00:42:27.269]  As we said yesterday, they may do.
[00:42:27.730 --> 00:42:40.236]  I mean, when I'm on conservative talk shows bashing Bush, and almost every caller agrees with me, and when the polls all show that Democrats were going to win between 10 and 15 percentage points, that is a massive, huge landslide.
[00:42:41.124 --> 00:42:43.226]  And so it's clear that there's some evidence of blunting.
[00:42:43.587 --> 00:42:51.535]  Was this Republican county clerks and Republican Secretary of State stealing, despite what Republican apparatchik gave them orders to do?
[00:42:52.016 --> 00:43:02.687]  Is this the neocon leadership deserting George Bush and kind of using him as a birdcage liner that has now been left in for a full week and has an inch of detritus built up on it?
[00:43:03.579 --> 00:43:04.460]  We're good to go.
[00:43:04.480 --> 00:43:05.100]  We're good to go.
[00:43:30.487 --> 00:43:32.448]  And that's really bottom line what's happening.
[00:43:32.708 --> 00:43:48.996]  Regardless of the different Machiavellian subterfuge going on in the Byzantine court, there in the fully bought and paid for, fully compromised, fully blackmailed Congress, House and Senate, regardless, they now are telling you Pelosi will be the Speaker.
[00:43:49.376 --> 00:43:52.118]  And it isn't just seniority that usually operates.
[00:43:52.978 --> 00:43:54.459]  The House leadership...
[00:43:55.467 --> 00:43:59.589]  Can block someone ascending to the speakership, and that should happen.
[00:43:59.909 --> 00:44:02.510]  But, again, you notice Republicans and Democrats are now announcing.
[00:44:02.771 --> 00:44:04.171]  Fox and CNN are now announcing.
[00:44:04.291 --> 00:44:04.912]  MSNBC.
[00:44:05.172 --> 00:44:16.097]  It's Nancy Pelosi, the new speaker, before the new House even goes back into session in January and when they vote for the new speaker.
[00:44:17.279 --> 00:44:28.725]  So, see, the average American doesn't even know the parliamentary procedure that gives us a speaker, so they're just telling us, kind of like they tell us hours before the polls close who's already won, as they've done in past elections.
[00:44:28.925 --> 00:44:30.706]  They're just telling us it's Nancy Pelosi.
[00:44:31.066 --> 00:44:38.410]  I'm calling for a national move for all like-minded liberals, conservatives, freedom lovers, to block Nancy Pelosi.
[00:44:38.810 --> 00:44:42.072]  Instead of running around, giggling in the streets, having mindless...
[00:44:42.652 --> 00:44:44.254]  We're good to go.
[00:45:03.658 --> 00:45:10.708]  There's going to be no move to get rid of the subsections of the Defense Authorization John Warner Act passed October 17th.
[00:45:11.049 --> 00:45:12.270]  And I'm calling for it.
[00:45:12.611 --> 00:45:17.638]  I'm calling for there to be a fight in the House and a fight in the Senate.
[00:45:17.678 --> 00:45:18.660]  I don't expect one in the Senate.
[00:45:18.680 --> 00:45:19.561]  It's totally controlled.
[00:45:21.026 --> 00:45:30.993]  By the Democrats to demand that a real Democrat get into control who will risk their lives, make no mistake, bushel launch, anthrax attacks, you name it, guaranteed probably stage another attack.
[00:45:31.053 --> 00:45:31.533]  So what?
[00:45:31.813 --> 00:45:37.377]  Let's push this dictator out into the open and not let him continue to sail on down the Rubicon here.
[00:45:38.095 --> 00:45:50.541]  We need to ensure that we punish a presidency, that we remove this individual who makes Nixon look like an angel, a knight of saint.
[00:45:51.941 --> 00:45:52.241]  All right.
[00:45:52.582 --> 00:45:53.142]  I've said it.
[00:45:54.282 --> 00:45:55.803]  I've laid out the analysis.
[00:45:57.003 --> 00:46:06.868]  And let's see if all the, quote, anti-establishment Democrat sites, the progressive sites, let's see if you roll over in giddy rapture now.
[00:46:08.371 --> 00:46:10.692]  Democrats need Virginia and Montana to take the Senate.
[00:46:10.972 --> 00:46:13.334]  Democrats captured four of the six Republican-held seats.
[00:46:13.674 --> 00:46:18.876]  They needed to take control of the Senate, winning critical contests in Ohio, Rhode Island, Pennsylvania, and Missouri.
[00:46:19.316 --> 00:46:22.238]  And it's closer Wednesday to erasing the GOP's majority.
[00:46:23.599 --> 00:46:32.145]  Seizing on voter discontent with President Bush in the war in Iraq, Democrats mounted challenges for the two remaining Republican-held seats in Virginia and Montana, and were ahead in both.
[00:46:32.625 --> 00:46:41.150]  But in Virginia, Democratic challenger James Webb, led over Republican incumbent George Allen, was razor thin with a recount was likely.
[00:46:41.170 --> 00:46:42.872]  All right, let me just stop right there.
[00:46:42.892 --> 00:46:44.272]  I just thought about something.
[00:46:46.074 --> 00:46:50.957]  How is CNN and The Washington Post, both reporting right now,
[00:46:51.983 --> 00:46:53.883]  This is a blurb we ought to get out instantly.
[00:46:54.524 --> 00:46:55.504]  Maybe on Jones Report.
[00:46:57.884 --> 00:46:58.725]  We multitask here.
[00:46:58.745 --> 00:47:00.325]  I've got writers out there right now listening.
[00:47:01.445 --> 00:47:09.407]  I know we've got bloggers that all listen to this broadcast for analysis, and you go basically put your own icing on it and put it out, and that's fine.
[00:47:11.408 --> 00:47:14.128]  We're glad to produce the talking points here for the American people.
[00:47:16.429 --> 00:47:17.369]  This makes no sense.
[00:47:17.489 --> 00:47:19.369]  It says Republicans have 49, Democrats have 49,
[00:47:22.074 --> 00:47:33.918]  And that two seats remain in Montana and Virginia with Republican Senator George Allen trailing Democrat Jim Webb with fewer than 6,000 votes in Virginia.
[00:47:35.638 --> 00:47:36.458]  This makes no sense.
[00:47:36.558 --> 00:47:37.659]  One of these is an independent.
[00:47:37.699 --> 00:47:38.619]  One of these is Lieberman.
[00:47:39.399 --> 00:47:42.500]  So I guess they're putting Lieberman in the Republican camp without telling us.
[00:47:43.661 --> 00:47:46.442]  Which you really can count Lieberman in the Republican camp.
[00:47:46.462 --> 00:47:48.942]  He's got to be included in this because it's 49-49 with two seats still
[00:47:51.707 --> 00:47:54.228]  In the running, out in the open, still in the pike.
[00:47:55.089 --> 00:47:58.011]  Still in Congress, still in traction, still in motion.
[00:47:58.551 --> 00:48:00.152]  Still up for grabs, still in play.
[00:48:00.852 --> 00:48:03.233]  Still in motion.
[00:48:04.154 --> 00:48:07.096]  Alright, I'm... I perseverate, folks, I'm sorry.
[00:48:07.116 --> 00:48:11.458]  33 at stake, 2 undecided.
[00:48:14.119 --> 00:48:16.021]  So if that's the case, they must be counting Lieberman.
[00:48:16.041 --> 00:48:19.963]  So let's say both seats go to the...
[00:48:20.851 --> 00:48:23.213]  Democrats, that will put them at 51.
[00:48:24.314 --> 00:48:30.160]  But then there's some Democratic senators or independents like Lieberman that will go with the Republicans.
[00:48:32.522 --> 00:48:38.187]  That means Cheney comes in with an attempted tiebreaker, but he can only be put into play in a tiebreaker.
[00:48:38.207 --> 00:48:45.514]  So I guess that's going to give the Democrats a one-up in the Senate, which isn't really a Democratic Senate.
[00:48:48.585 --> 00:48:50.606]  Boy, this is bizarre.
[00:48:50.646 --> 00:48:52.426]  We need to have that question answered.
[00:48:52.506 --> 00:48:54.407]  Why are they counting Lieberman as a Republican?
[00:48:55.007 --> 00:48:56.388]  I guess they've got to be doing that here.
[00:48:56.408 --> 00:48:57.288]  Who made that decision?
[00:48:58.588 --> 00:48:59.709]  Why is it being pointed out?
[00:48:59.789 --> 00:49:02.229]  Why is there an asterisk there explaining that?
[00:49:02.990 --> 00:49:04.990]  Let's go to Lloyd in New York.
[00:49:05.010 --> 00:49:05.671]  Thanks for holding.
[00:49:05.711 --> 00:49:06.051]  Welcome.
[00:49:06.591 --> 00:49:07.751]  Hey, how are you doing, Alex?
[00:49:08.071 --> 00:49:08.331]  Good.
[00:49:08.792 --> 00:49:09.312]  Good, good.
[00:49:10.132 --> 00:49:11.412]  I've got a couple of questions.
[00:49:11.472 --> 00:49:12.753]  It's more like a three-part question.
[00:49:13.013 --> 00:49:13.213]  All right?
[00:49:13.926 --> 00:49:21.309]  Let me just announce, the Democrats have now been announced just one in Wyoming, only leaving the Senate battle open in Virginia.
[00:49:21.329 --> 00:49:21.989]  Please continue.
[00:49:22.349 --> 00:49:22.969]  Right, right.
[00:49:23.410 --> 00:49:25.010]  Tester announced that he won in Montana.
[00:49:25.070 --> 00:49:25.490]  Right, right.
[00:49:26.071 --> 00:49:26.471]  All right.
[00:49:26.511 --> 00:49:32.493]  As for my question, we all know Pelosi can be a pivotal key, but what exactly for?
[00:49:32.673 --> 00:49:34.754]  I mean, as you already know, you posted it on your site.
[00:49:35.474 --> 00:49:40.656]  They just recently took down the Operation Iraqi Freedom, the documentation portal site.
[00:49:41.357 --> 00:49:53.307]  Right after the midterm elections started, right after they announced Saddam was going to be friggin' executed by the end of the year, I mean, what relevance does Pelosi have to what possibly could be the setup for a false flag?
[00:49:56.192 --> 00:49:56.612]  I'm sorry.
[00:49:56.632 --> 00:49:58.534]  I'm not normally ignoring listeners.
[00:49:58.554 --> 00:50:00.995]  I was telling them to go record Bush.
[00:50:01.295 --> 00:50:02.376]  He's about to go on here in minutes.
[00:50:02.396 --> 00:50:03.977]  We can play it afterwards and analyze it.
[00:50:04.337 --> 00:50:10.341]  Coming up the next hour, you were bringing up what does it matter if they're about to execute... By the end of the year, they announced it.
[00:50:10.461 --> 00:50:11.201]  Yeah, I understand.
[00:50:11.301 --> 00:50:12.082]  Right, right.
[00:50:12.142 --> 00:50:14.283]  What does that matter?
[00:50:14.303 --> 00:50:15.964]  I mean, they're just getting rid of their business partner.
[00:50:16.864 --> 00:50:17.145]  Well, it...
[00:50:18.169 --> 00:50:30.598]  I mean, it matters in that we have a chance to wedge this and to point out to the American people that Pelosi doesn't have to be the Speaker, and we can demand that impeachment hearings kick off.
[00:50:30.638 --> 00:50:31.739]  That's wildly popular.
[00:50:32.079 --> 00:50:33.020]  It's constitutional.
[00:50:33.060 --> 00:50:35.401]  If anybody deserves to be impeached, it's George Bush.
[00:50:35.421 --> 00:50:36.922]  This is very true.
[00:50:36.942 --> 00:50:39.024]  You're going to commercial, aren't you?
[00:50:39.637 --> 00:50:41.479]  Yeah, I'm going to... You got more you want to add?
[00:50:41.499 --> 00:50:41.799]  Uh, yeah.
[00:50:42.060 --> 00:50:42.600]  Okay, stay there.
[00:50:42.620 --> 00:50:43.101]  I'll break you late.
[00:50:43.121 --> 00:50:44.402]  You can continue on the other side.
[00:50:44.902 --> 00:50:47.986]  Significant announcement by Lord Bush coming up in about ten minutes.
[00:50:48.967 --> 00:50:52.890]  So we'll... In fact, maybe we'll even carry that live for you here.
[00:50:53.731 --> 00:50:56.234]  We'll be right back on the Genesis Communications Network.
[00:51:04.352 --> 00:51:07.535]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[00:51:07.875 --> 00:51:09.817]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[00:51:10.177 --> 00:51:17.843]  Shockingly classified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:18.524 --> 00:51:25.589]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:51:25.969 --> 00:51:28.932]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran.
[00:51:29.252 --> 00:51:31.614]  The White House probing to disseminate fake news.
[00:51:32.034 --> 00:51:32.855]  NSA spies.
[00:51:34.048 --> 00:51:37.390]  The latest 9-11 information and much, much more.
[00:51:37.691 --> 00:51:41.313]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:51:41.673 --> 00:51:43.554]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:51:43.934 --> 00:51:47.837]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:54:16.394 --> 00:54:18.154]  And my distributors never see anything like it.
[00:54:18.194 --> 00:54:27.218]  They have four to six weeks for delivery up on their site with a big listing, which has killed people purchasing it because they think, and I don't want to say it's a conspiracy.
[00:54:27.298 --> 00:54:28.418]  I'm just so sick of it.
[00:54:29.253 --> 00:54:30.793]  They're supposedly going to take that down.
[00:54:30.833 --> 00:54:31.714]  We've contacted them.
[00:54:31.734 --> 00:54:33.114]  We went up into the top ten.
[00:54:33.714 --> 00:54:37.695]  Then they claimed that they were sold out, which they were, but it takes two days to deliver it to them.
[00:54:37.735 --> 00:54:40.155]  They got them on Tuesday.
[00:54:40.175 --> 00:54:41.716]  It is in stock.
[00:54:41.776 --> 00:54:45.176]  You get it in about three days after ordering it from them.
[00:54:46.136 --> 00:54:52.118]  And please go to Amazon.com and get Terror Storm, my new film, the history of government-sponsored terror.
[00:54:52.898 --> 00:54:58.159]  It's about a two-hour film, about under two hours and 68 minutes of extras from the 9-11 Neocon Agenda Symposium in L.A.,
[00:54:59.458 --> 00:55:02.459]  Amazing film.
[00:55:02.819 --> 00:55:03.499]  It's $11.19.
[00:55:04.539 --> 00:55:07.260]  And if you can afford it, I want you to buy 10, 15, 20 copies.
[00:55:08.200 --> 00:55:10.441]  Give that as your gifts this holiday season for Christmas.
[00:55:10.481 --> 00:55:11.381]  Give it as a birthday present.
[00:55:11.621 --> 00:55:12.561]  Give it as an early gift.
[00:55:12.581 --> 00:55:13.461]  This country can't wait.
[00:55:13.761 --> 00:55:22.983]  And drive it to number one on Amazon.com because stores and companies around the nation and the world do a lot of their purchasing and carrying of videos via that indicator.
[00:55:23.543 --> 00:55:25.804]  It's the New York Times bestseller list of videos.
[00:55:26.750 --> 00:55:31.032]  It's already gotten a lot of attention, being in the top 10 and being in the top 20 for a couple days.
[00:55:31.392 --> 00:55:40.135]  Now it's in the top 100, about to go out of the top 100 because of their bizarre... Well, they also changed the link that went to a page that didn't have Terror Storm.
[00:55:40.155 --> 00:55:41.435]  Then they changed it to another page.
[00:55:41.736 --> 00:55:43.496]  They're doing a lot of weird stuff, folks.
[00:55:44.497 --> 00:55:48.818]  And, you know, when you get to this level, you do get bizarre behavior happening.
[00:55:49.238 --> 00:55:53.540]  So please, go to Amazon.com, order a whole bunch of Terror Storm.
[00:55:54.563 --> 00:55:57.545]  And get it out to everybody you know, or order it via Infowars.com.
[00:55:57.565 --> 00:56:00.266]  You can get America, Freedom to Fascism.
[00:56:00.826 --> 00:56:04.028]  America... Pardon me?
[00:56:06.849 --> 00:56:07.570]  Yeah, I knew that.
[00:56:07.990 --> 00:56:08.970]  In fact, they were just telling me.
[00:56:09.010 --> 00:56:09.691]  Thanks for telling me.
[00:56:10.191 --> 00:56:12.312]  Yeah, during the break, I saw Rumsfeld was stepping down.
[00:56:12.332 --> 00:56:13.312]  I was about to get into that.
[00:56:13.333 --> 00:56:17.355]  And this is him throwing us a salve, throwing us a lollipop.
[00:56:17.655 --> 00:56:18.655]  You know, and the kid's crying.
[00:56:18.675 --> 00:56:20.156]  Here's a lollipop, basically.
[00:56:21.068 --> 00:56:23.671]  And, you know, Rumsfeld would never step down, and they would never.
[00:56:23.731 --> 00:56:25.713]  So, again, they're giving us the Democrats.
[00:56:25.793 --> 00:56:29.818]  They're giving Rumsfeld standing down, and, oh, they're sorry.
[00:56:29.938 --> 00:56:37.346]  And then the terrorists will hit us, and the Democrats will have to get tough and agree with George W., and everybody will come together, you know, something like that.
[00:56:39.048 --> 00:56:40.129]  This is what they always do.
[00:56:40.169 --> 00:56:41.210]  They double-team us.
[00:56:41.410 --> 00:56:42.672]  But getting back to the videos.
[00:56:44.662 --> 00:56:46.644]  I want to push it to number one on Amazon.com.
[00:56:46.684 --> 00:56:47.885]  I want to be able to say it's number one.
[00:56:47.905 --> 00:56:50.868]  That'll be invaluable to making this film go supernova.
[00:56:51.228 --> 00:56:52.890]  I put it out for free on Google Video.
[00:56:53.831 --> 00:56:55.152]  This is not about profit here.
[00:56:55.172 --> 00:56:57.795]  This is about getting it out to the public.
[00:56:59.336 --> 00:57:00.797]  I mean, Amazon wanted to sell it for $20.
[00:57:00.877 --> 00:57:02.999]  We told them, no, we want to sell it for $11.
[00:57:04.721 --> 00:57:06.943]  We struck a deal to sell this as cheap as possible.
[00:57:07.664 --> 00:57:09.906]  You cannot beat this deal right now.
[00:57:10.786 --> 00:57:12.046]  At Amazon.com.
[00:57:12.066 --> 00:57:13.947]  Go to Infowars.com, PrisonPundit.com.
[00:57:13.967 --> 00:57:15.307]  We have links to the subpages.
[00:57:16.007 --> 00:57:18.288]  They haven't changed the links again to frustrate your purchasing.
[00:57:18.748 --> 00:57:20.528]  Don't let them stop you from doing this.
[00:57:20.988 --> 00:57:22.208]  Google admits they censored it.
[00:57:22.228 --> 00:57:23.209]  A lot of other stuff's happened.
[00:57:23.609 --> 00:57:25.049]  Get Terror Storm at this insane price.
[00:57:25.089 --> 00:57:25.849]  Go buy ten copies.
[00:57:26.369 --> 00:57:27.209]  Go buy nine copies.
[00:57:28.210 --> 00:57:31.010]  Nine copies is $100 or less.
[00:57:32.871 --> 00:57:33.311]  Go do it.
[00:57:34.431 --> 00:57:34.871]  Go do it.
[00:57:35.891 --> 00:57:38.032]  Please help us get this information out to the people.
[00:57:38.612 --> 00:57:39.712]  This is a call to action.
[00:57:41.767 --> 00:57:44.970]  Or you can get America, Freedom to Fascism, my friends, for $19.95.
[00:57:45.010 --> 00:57:48.953]  Aaron Russo's incredible film.
[00:57:49.273 --> 00:57:50.254]  He's now being censored.
[00:57:50.454 --> 00:57:54.738]  He can't even sell it now, though, because PayPal just said, we're not going to do business with you and wouldn't tell him why.
[00:57:55.138 --> 00:57:56.439]  He's having to threaten to sue them right now.
[00:57:56.479 --> 00:57:57.640]  He's coming on the third hour about that.
[00:57:57.880 --> 00:58:01.623]  You can get it right now online via our Yahoo store at InfoWars.com.
[00:58:01.923 --> 00:58:04.706]  And for $9.95, get Terror Storm when you get it, if you wish.
[00:58:05.586 --> 00:58:06.367]  You cannot beat that.
[00:58:07.054 --> 00:58:15.839]  So get up for $9.95 with American Freedom to Fascism on Infowars.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139 or by writing to us.
[00:58:16.099 --> 00:58:18.800]  Okay, we've got Greg Palast coming up five after.
[00:58:18.820 --> 00:58:20.681]  We'll come back, and I'm going to go quick, okay?
[00:58:20.941 --> 00:58:22.622]  Lloyd, just make your statement when we get back.
[00:58:22.923 --> 00:58:23.763]  Mike, make your statement.
[00:58:23.803 --> 00:58:24.724]  Joe, make your statements.
[00:58:25.104 --> 00:58:26.965]  Because I'm going to go to all three of you in the next segment.
[00:58:27.165 --> 00:58:28.586]  Then to more callers with Greg Palast.
[00:58:28.786 --> 00:58:30.947]  Bev Harris popping in with reports of election fraud.
[00:58:31.207 --> 00:58:32.528]  We try to decipher all of this.
[00:58:32.948 --> 00:58:34.609]  Very important broadcast today.
[00:58:35.189 --> 00:58:39.191]  We need to call for Nancy Pelosi to not be the speaker and for Bush to be impeached.
[00:58:41.113 --> 00:58:46.015]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNlive.com or call toll free 877-300-7645.
[00:58:57.640 --> 00:58:58.281]  Big Brother.
[00:58:58.941 --> 00:59:00.002]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.702 --> 00:59:01.823]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.483 --> 00:59:03.284]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.044 --> 00:59:04.945]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.605 --> 00:59:09.288]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.788 --> 00:59:13.871]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:16.311 --> 00:59:16.991]  We're good to go.
[00:59:17.051 --> 00:59:17.352]  I think?
[00:59:41.562 --> 00:59:44.305]  Basically, right now I have 50 seats.
[00:59:44.606 --> 00:59:45.867]  It's still in play in Virginia.
[00:59:46.208 --> 00:59:47.549]  Rumsfeld is stepping down.
[00:59:47.569 --> 00:59:51.715]  They're throwing you a bone to make you think you've had a revolution, to make you think you're in control.
[00:59:51.975 --> 00:59:57.722]  When 84% in Gallup polls and Scripps Howard News Service polls, that number came up twice in two major polls.
[00:59:57.742 --> 00:59:58.363]  That number's key.
[01:00:00.742 --> 01:00:08.025]  When something like that happens, they then try to put a salve in place, but Nancy Pelosi's saying no impeachment, no investigation.
[01:00:08.485 --> 01:00:11.966]  They're not even telling you in the media that the Democrats can fight to not have her be the leader.
[01:00:12.867 --> 01:00:17.329]  Right now, let's go ahead and let Lloyd in New York finish.
[01:00:17.349 --> 01:00:17.869]  Quickly, Lloyd.
[01:00:18.838 --> 01:00:23.741]  All right, well, case in point, obviously I don't have time to give you a question, but what does knowing accomplish?
[01:00:23.821 --> 01:00:27.764]  I mean, as far as most people are concerned, this is just hearsay.
[01:00:27.824 --> 01:00:32.887]  So when it comes right down to it, as much as we can prove, as much as we can prove, what inevitably can be done?
[01:00:33.028 --> 01:00:34.529]  What can we do with this information?
[01:00:35.049 --> 01:00:37.270]  Well, sir, we're fighting back and we're having a lot of victories.
[01:00:37.330 --> 01:00:38.271]  I appreciate your call.
[01:00:38.311 --> 01:00:40.573]  I mean, we have so many victories, it's ridiculous.
[01:00:40.693 --> 01:00:43.955]  I don't really just get the repeated statement of what can we do, what can we do.
[01:00:44.682 --> 01:00:46.083]  Just lie down and die, I guess.
[01:00:46.784 --> 01:00:48.526]  Let's go, I mean, I'm not going to.
[01:00:48.586 --> 01:00:50.047]  Let's go ahead and talk to Mike in New York.
[01:00:50.107 --> 01:00:50.668]  Mike, go ahead.
[01:00:52.211 --> 01:00:52.651]  Hi, Alex.
[01:00:52.691 --> 01:00:53.692]  Thanks for taking my call.
[01:00:54.252 --> 01:00:56.994]  I think I know what... Hello, Alex?
[01:00:57.154 --> 01:00:57.554]  Yes, yes.
[01:00:57.614 --> 01:00:57.995]  You're on air.
[01:00:58.095 --> 01:00:58.355]  Okay.
[01:00:58.595 --> 01:01:00.756]  Hey, I think I know what Bush's statement's going to be.
[01:01:00.776 --> 01:01:04.238]  He's going to use that new word you invented as part of his strategery.
[01:01:05.219 --> 01:01:10.002]  I want to make a comment, Alex, that when you opened up the show, you hit it right on the head.
[01:01:10.482 --> 01:01:14.224]  You're still the sharpest knife in the draw, and I'm not disrespecting everybody else.
[01:01:14.244 --> 01:01:17.286]  They're all sharp knives to have in that draw, but you hit it, buddy.
[01:01:17.984 --> 01:01:21.385]  The change was not because anything Pelosi did or a Democrat.
[01:01:21.545 --> 01:01:26.347]  Hopefully it was all due to people just telling the incumbents, go stick it, go get a real job.
[01:01:26.847 --> 01:01:33.950]  Let's get the new guys in, and let's keep on these new guys, making sure that the commies like Pelosi don't get them under their wings.
[01:01:34.310 --> 01:01:37.011]  So keep driving that issue for the next two years, Alex.
[01:01:37.591 --> 01:01:39.632]  It's a grassroots movement attempting to...
[01:01:40.586 --> 01:01:44.187]  Have a political effect in whatever way we can.
[01:01:44.388 --> 01:01:53.031]  And they're attempting to hijack a grassroots movement so Democrats, instead of celebrating like a bunch of giddy schoolgirls, need to be angry right now.
[01:01:54.019 --> 01:02:01.787]  Yes, I think, Alex, that all in all, what else could we hope for this election except to at least get most of the incumbents out?
[01:02:02.267 --> 01:02:03.168]  That was a breakthrough.
[01:02:03.188 --> 01:02:08.454]  Now, of course, we didn't have much to choose from, and these commies and the Democrats are going to try to use it to their advantage.
[01:02:08.574 --> 01:02:10.656]  Now we've got a choice of the fascists or the commies?
[01:02:11.283 --> 01:02:11.703]  That's right.
[01:02:11.723 --> 01:02:12.983]  Of course, Alex.
[01:02:13.224 --> 01:02:19.805]  God forbid we don't get leverage over these Democrats and make them wake up and take control and get the commies out of their ranks.
[01:02:20.325 --> 01:02:22.886]  My God, it'll be a Clinton-Bush, Clinton-Bush thing.
[01:02:22.966 --> 01:02:27.227]  And one consolidates, one initiates, the next one's going to consolidate.
[01:02:27.247 --> 01:02:29.388]  It's like they're laying pipelines.
[01:02:29.588 --> 01:02:31.550]  I live in Pennsylvania, but I have a friend.
[01:02:57.383 --> 01:03:02.125]  Who lives in Maryland, and he was saying, I'm going to vote for Ben Cardin.
[01:03:03.025 --> 01:03:03.485]  He's good.
[01:03:03.545 --> 01:03:06.707]  I said, he's not good because he voted for the Patriot Act.
[01:03:07.947 --> 01:03:10.808]  And I was trying to tell him the Patriot Act is no good.
[01:03:10.848 --> 01:03:13.129]  He was trying to get me to explain why it's no good.
[01:03:13.169 --> 01:03:15.890]  And you mentioned that Section 802?
[01:03:16.470 --> 01:03:16.710]  Yes.
[01:03:17.511 --> 01:03:21.492]  And it says that all crimes will be punishable, right?
[01:03:21.772 --> 01:03:23.033]  Yeah, it's a terrorism, yeah.
[01:03:23.493 --> 01:03:26.094]  Is there any place where I can actually go to
[01:03:28.720 --> 01:03:30.242]  Pull that down?
[01:03:30.482 --> 01:03:31.363]  Yes, H.R.
[01:03:31.383 --> 01:03:33.384]  3162 is the USA Patriot Act.
[01:03:34.645 --> 01:03:34.865]  H.R.?
[01:03:34.885 --> 01:03:34.865]  3162.
[01:03:34.986 --> 01:03:36.967]  Okay, thank you.
[01:03:37.568 --> 01:03:37.948]  Thank you.
[01:03:37.968 --> 01:03:39.870]  Good to have you on board with us, Joe.
[01:03:40.610 --> 01:03:41.971]  All right, continual coverage.
[01:03:42.091 --> 01:03:42.752]  Open phones.
[01:03:42.772 --> 01:03:46.495]  Greg Palast, Bev Harris, Aaron Russo chiming in today.
[01:03:46.515 --> 01:03:46.975]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:03:47.115 --> 01:03:48.837]  The Democrats have taken the Senate.
[01:03:56.480 --> 01:03:59.683]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[01:04:00.023 --> 01:04:01.944]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[01:04:02.345 --> 01:04:10.011]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:04:10.671 --> 01:04:17.737]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:04:18.137 --> 01:04:21.060]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran.
[01:04:21.460 --> 01:04:23.782]  A White House program to disseminate fake news.
[01:04:24.202 --> 01:04:25.043]  NSA spies.
[01:04:25.578 --> 01:04:26.919]  Or by calling toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[01:04:26.939 --> 01:04:28.841]  Or watch it right now online at prisonplanet.tv.
[01:04:53.331 --> 01:04:55.192]  Dad, can we stop?
[01:04:55.512 --> 01:04:57.053]  We need to go to the bathroom.
[01:04:57.454 --> 01:04:57.694]  What?
[01:04:58.054 --> 01:04:58.434]  Again?
[01:04:58.855 --> 01:05:00.476]  We just stopped two hours ago.
[01:05:00.536 --> 01:05:04.958]  Honey, let's stop, because I gave the kids their Spark Berkey water bottles.
[01:05:05.199 --> 01:05:06.499]  Why did you do that?
[01:05:06.699 --> 01:05:12.503]  Because they can't drink and talk at the same time, and that way we don't have to listen to them singing, Are we there yet?
[01:05:12.783 --> 01:05:13.824]  Are we there yet?
[01:05:13.924 --> 01:05:15.005]  for the entire trip.
[01:05:15.245 --> 01:05:17.446]  Hmm, I didn't think about that.
[01:05:17.927 --> 01:05:18.947]  Great idea.
[01:05:19.227 --> 01:05:21.789]  Yeah, and it's cheap entertainment for the kids.
[01:05:22.153 --> 01:05:24.619]  Bottled water costs around 75 cents a bottle.
[01:05:24.819 --> 01:05:29.209]  And using our Bertie Sport bottles, it costs us less than two and a half cents per refill.
[01:05:29.510 --> 01:05:29.811]  Honey!
[01:05:30.632 --> 01:05:31.872]  You're terrific!
[01:05:32.272 --> 01:05:33.753]  Oh, honey, so are you.
[01:05:33.873 --> 01:05:37.274]  You're the one that bought the family our sport Berkey water bottles.
[01:05:37.554 --> 01:05:38.354]  Now, can we stop?
[01:05:38.854 --> 01:05:39.574]  I need to go, too.
[01:05:39.874 --> 01:05:44.315]  Get your Berkey Sport Purification Bottle for only $39 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:05:44.375 --> 01:05:44.675]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:05:44.715 --> 01:05:46.276]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[01:05:54.935 --> 01:05:56.236]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument.
[01:06:16.198 --> 01:06:17.079]  Don't just treat symptoms.
[01:06:38.960 --> 01:06:40.701]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:06:40.761 --> 01:06:42.102]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:08.819 --> 01:07:26.626]  Okay, President Bush just announced that the former CIA director and the head of the CIA command base, Texas A&M, Robert Gates, will be the new Secretary of Defense.
[01:07:26.686 --> 01:07:30.528]  Let's go ahead and go to President Bush speaking live right now.
[01:07:31.308 --> 01:07:32.508]  ...for those on the front lines.
[01:07:34.369 --> 01:07:36.230]  To our enemies, do not be joyful.
[01:07:37.972 --> 01:07:41.113]  Do not confuse the workings of our democracies with a lack of will.
[01:07:43.074 --> 01:07:45.235]  Our nation is committed to bringing you to justice.
[01:07:47.016 --> 01:07:54.578]  Liberty and democracy are the source of America's strength, and liberty and democracy will lift up the hopes and desires of those you are trying to destroy.
[01:07:54.598 --> 01:08:00.301]  To the people of Iraq, do not be fearful.
[01:08:02.141 --> 01:08:05.963]  As you take the difficult steps toward democracy and peace, America is going to stand with you.
[01:08:07.867 --> 01:08:11.188]  We know you want a better way of life, and now is the time to seize it.
[01:08:13.009 --> 01:08:15.730]  To our brave men and women in uniform, don't be doubtful.
[01:08:16.811 --> 01:08:19.132]  America will always support you.
[01:08:20.813 --> 01:08:27.296]  Our nation is blessed to have men and women who volunteer to serve and are willing to risk their own lives for the safety of our fellow citizens.
[01:08:29.436 --> 01:08:35.099]  When I first came to Washington nearly six years ago, I was hopeful I could help change the tone here in the Capitol.
[01:08:36.508 --> 01:08:43.152]  As Governor of Texas, I have successfully worked with both Democrats and Republicans to find common-sense solutions to the problems facing our state.
[01:08:43.172 --> 01:08:49.436]  While we've made some progress on changing the tone, I'm disappointed we haven't made more.
[01:08:49.456 --> 01:08:52.698]  I'm confident that we can work together.
[01:08:54.639 --> 01:08:59.061]  I'm confident we can overcome the temptation to divide this country between red and blue.
[01:09:00.802 --> 01:09:03.344]  The issues before us are bigger than that, and we are bigger than that.
[01:09:04.835 --> 01:09:12.919]  By putting this election and partisanship behind us, we can launch a new era of cooperation and make these next two years productive ones for the American people.
[01:09:12.939 --> 01:09:15.921]  Appreciate your interest.
[01:09:16.141 --> 01:09:17.322]  Now I'll answer some questions.
[01:09:17.522 --> 01:09:17.822]  Terry.
[01:09:20.143 --> 01:09:21.043]  Thank you, Mr. President.
[01:09:21.484 --> 01:09:26.026]  Does the departure of Don Rumsfeld signal a new direction in Iraq?
[01:09:26.746 --> 01:09:31.469]  A solid majority of Americans said yesterday that they wanted
[01:09:32.618 --> 01:09:35.840]  Some American troops, if not all, withdrawn from Iraq.
[01:09:36.180 --> 01:09:38.282]  Did you hear that call, and will you heed it?
[01:09:39.463 --> 01:09:42.525]  Terry, I'd like our troops to come home too, but I want them to come home with victory.
[01:09:42.825 --> 01:09:46.068]  And that is a country that can govern itself, sustain itself, and defend itself.
[01:09:47.489 --> 01:09:49.331]  And I can understand Americans saying, come home.
[01:09:51.252 --> 01:09:57.157]  But I don't know if they said come home and leave behind an Iraq that could end up being a safe haven for Al-Qaeda.
[01:09:57.177 --> 01:09:58.217]  I don't believe they said that.
[01:09:58.237 --> 01:09:59.879]  And so...
[01:10:01.261 --> 01:10:03.082]  I'm committed to victory.
[01:10:03.903 --> 01:10:07.946]  I'm committed to helping this country so that we can come home.
[01:10:08.907 --> 01:10:12.130]  Now, first part about... Oh, new direction.
[01:10:12.470 --> 01:10:14.772]  Well, there's certainly going to be new leadership at the Pentagon.
[01:10:14.812 --> 01:10:22.038]  And as I mentioned in my comments, Secretary Rumsfeld and I agreed that sometimes it's necessary to have a fresh perspective.
[01:10:23.079 --> 01:10:25.040]  And Bob Gates will bring a fresh perspective.
[01:10:25.081 --> 01:10:27.142]  He'll also bring great managerial experience.
[01:10:28.103 --> 01:10:28.764]  And he is...
[01:10:29.833 --> 01:10:32.935]  I had a good talk with him on Sunday in Crawford.
[01:10:34.596 --> 01:10:41.101]  It took me a while to be able to sit down and visit with him, and I did, and I found him to be of like mind.
[01:10:41.261 --> 01:10:43.703]  He understands we're in a global war against these terrorists.
[01:10:44.463 --> 01:10:52.549]  He understands that defeat is not an option in Iraq, and I believe it's important that there be a fresh perspective, and so does Secretary Rumsfeld.
[01:10:52.589 --> 01:10:52.769]  Steve.
[01:10:54.699 --> 01:10:55.440]  Thank you, Mr. President.
[01:10:55.460 --> 01:10:58.141]  Last week you told us that Secretary Rumsfeld will be staying on.
[01:10:58.542 --> 01:11:02.965]  Why is the timing right now for this, and how much does it have to do with the election results?
[01:11:03.045 --> 01:11:03.285]  Right.
[01:11:03.986 --> 01:11:12.011]  No, you and Hunt, and Kyle came into Oval Office, and Hunt asked me the question one week before the campaign.
[01:11:12.471 --> 01:11:15.454]  And basically, he said, you're going to do something about Rumsfeld and the Vice President.
[01:11:15.574 --> 01:11:17.575]  And my answer was, you know, they're going to stay on.
[01:11:17.595 --> 01:11:23.039]  And the reason why is I didn't want to inject a major decision about this war in the final days of a campaign.
[01:11:24.790 --> 01:11:29.052]  So the only way to answer that question and to get you on to another question was to give you that answer.
[01:11:31.593 --> 01:11:39.376]  The truth of the matter is as well, I mean, that's one reason I gave the answer, but the other reason why is I hadn't had a chance to visit with Bob Gates yet.
[01:11:39.716 --> 01:11:43.838]  And I hadn't had my final conversation with Don Rumsfeld yet at that point.
[01:11:44.218 --> 01:11:48.540]  I had been talking with Don Rumsfeld over a period of time about fresh perspective.
[01:11:48.580 --> 01:11:50.080]  He likes to call it fresh eyes.
[01:11:51.481 --> 01:11:54.382]  He himself understands that Iraq is not working well enough
[01:11:55.153 --> 01:11:55.794]  Fast enough.
[01:11:57.679 --> 01:12:00.407]  And he and I are constantly assessing.
[01:12:00.427 --> 01:12:03.354]  And I'm assessing
[01:12:04.259 --> 01:12:09.961]  You know, this is quite a finessing of the truth here that the President is engaged in.
[01:12:09.981 --> 01:12:20.986]  He was absolutely solid in the support of Secretary Rumsfeld last week, saying that as long as he was President, Donald Rumsfeld would be the Secretary of Defense.
[01:12:21.006 --> 01:12:23.767]  So it is not exactly as he is portraying it here.
[01:12:23.787 --> 01:12:24.167]  All right.
[01:12:32.432 --> 01:12:37.336]  We're carrying USA Radio Network, the network has during some of the news breaks on some of the shows.
[01:12:37.376 --> 01:12:41.640]  You can hear even the Neocon network kind of admitting that Bush is lying right now.
[01:12:42.260 --> 01:12:52.589]  So we're carrying some of his statements, and now this press conference will tell you all about Robert Gates, former CIA director to run the Pentagon now as defense secretary.
[01:12:52.649 --> 01:12:56.833]  Let's go back to the gun-grabbing, open-border-promoting traitor.
[01:12:57.563 --> 01:13:05.686]  Before this election in Texas, you said that Democrats, no matter how they put it, their approach to Iraq comes down to terrorists win, America loses.
[01:13:06.906 --> 01:13:08.807]  What has changed today, number one?
[01:13:08.867 --> 01:13:18.430]  Number two, is this administration prepared to deal with the level of oversight and investigation that is possibly going to come from one chamber or two in Congress?
[01:13:19.091 --> 01:13:22.672]  What's changed today is the election's over and the Democrats won.
[01:13:23.959 --> 01:13:27.800]  And now we're going to work together for two years to accomplish big objectives for the country.
[01:13:28.860 --> 01:13:35.683]  And secondly, the Democrats are going to have to make up their mind about how they're going to conduct their affairs.
[01:13:35.723 --> 01:13:39.564]  And I haven't had a chance to talk with the leadership yet about these issues.
[01:13:40.664 --> 01:13:45.365]  But we'll begin consultations with the Democrat leadership starting Thursday and Friday.
[01:13:46.886 --> 01:13:47.206]  David.
[01:13:49.767 --> 01:13:50.107]  Thank you.
[01:13:50.167 --> 01:13:53.668]  You acknowledge that this is a message election on the war in Iraq
[01:13:54.386 --> 01:13:59.788]  And so the American public today, having voted, we want to know what you mean in terms of course correction on Iraq.
[01:13:59.848 --> 01:14:09.792]  And particularly in light of this fact, that last week the Vice President pointed out that you and he aren't running for anything anymore and that it's, quote, full speed ahead on Iraq.
[01:14:10.252 --> 01:14:11.012]  So which is it?
[01:14:11.212 --> 01:14:13.973]  Are you listening to the voters or are you listening to the Vice President?
[01:14:14.213 --> 01:14:15.574]  And what does that mean?
[01:14:15.594 --> 01:14:22.036]  David, I believe Iraq had a lot to do with the election, but I believe there's other factors as well.
[01:14:23.929 --> 01:14:28.532]  People want their congressmen to be honest and ethical.
[01:14:29.552 --> 01:14:32.794]  In some races, that was the primary factor.
[01:14:35.095 --> 01:14:40.158]  There were different factors that determined the outcome of different races, but no question, Iraq was on people's minds.
[01:14:41.179 --> 01:14:46.962]  And as you have just learned, I am making a change.
[01:14:47.842 --> 01:14:56.664]  So notice here, folks, that they're in super overdrive with spin right now.
[01:14:57.444 --> 01:15:01.225]  But what we should be talking about is the gas prices.
[01:15:01.265 --> 01:15:02.805]  Will they now jack those back up?
[01:15:02.845 --> 01:15:04.285]  We know they brought them down for the election.
[01:15:04.305 --> 01:15:05.906]  We know they're in control of that at many levels.
[01:15:06.586 --> 01:15:09.927]  And will they go ahead and go into Iran now as a way to smokescreen all of this?
[01:15:10.087 --> 01:15:13.247]  Or what's going to happen to the economy now?
[01:15:13.347 --> 01:15:16.168]  What's going to happen with the overprinting of dollars?
[01:15:16.878 --> 01:15:18.419]  And the inflation of the currency.
[01:15:18.459 --> 01:15:22.560]  Those are some of the questions we'll be going over when we come back in the next segment.
[01:15:22.580 --> 01:15:23.921]  But let's go ahead and go back to the President.
[01:15:27.182 --> 01:15:28.343]  Can you go back to the President?
[01:15:28.763 --> 01:15:32.825]  Perhaps I need to do a better job of explaining that we're constantly adjusting.
[01:15:33.805 --> 01:15:40.748]  And to this fresh perspective, what the American people are hearing today is we're constantly looking for a fresh perspective.
[01:15:42.189 --> 01:15:44.850]  But what's also important for the American people to understand is that
[01:15:46.132 --> 01:15:49.934]  If we were to leave before the job is done, the country becomes more at risk.
[01:15:51.795 --> 01:15:58.519]  The Vice President is saying, Al-Qaeda will have safe havens for which to launch attacks.
[01:15:59.940 --> 01:16:07.504]  These radicals and extremists have made it clear they want to topple moderate governments to spread their ideology.
[01:16:08.885 --> 01:16:15.369]  They believe that it's just a matter of time before we leave so they can implement their strategies.
[01:16:15.987 --> 01:16:16.948]  We're just not going to let them do that.
[01:16:16.968 --> 01:16:23.773]  We're going to help this government become a government that can defend, govern, and sustain itself, and an ally in the war on terror.
[01:16:23.813 --> 01:16:30.919]  Yes, sir.
[01:16:30.939 --> 01:16:32.280]  We've got another man with the mic.
[01:16:32.320 --> 01:16:32.920]  David, please.
[01:16:33.521 --> 01:16:34.442]  Mr. President, thank you.
[01:16:35.142 --> 01:16:39.786]  Can I just start by asking you to clarify, sir, if in your meeting with Steve and Terry and Dick,
[01:16:40.356 --> 01:16:44.077]  Did you know at that point you would be making a change on Secretary Rumsfeld?
[01:16:44.137 --> 01:16:44.637]  No, I did not.
[01:16:44.657 --> 01:16:47.158]  And the reason I didn't know is because I hadn't visited with his replacement.
[01:16:48.339 --> 01:16:49.239]  Potential replacement.
[01:16:49.579 --> 01:16:51.560]  But you knew he would be leaving just not who would replace him?
[01:16:51.600 --> 01:16:52.760]  No, I didn't know that at the time.
[01:16:53.240 --> 01:16:54.881]  May I ask you about Nancy Pelosi?
[01:16:54.901 --> 01:17:08.085]  The other thing I did know as well is that that kind of question, a wise question by a seasoned reporter, is the kind of thing that causes one to either inject...
[01:17:09.005 --> 01:17:11.887]  Major military decisions at the end of a campaign or not.
[01:17:12.047 --> 01:17:20.952]  And I had made the decision that I wasn't going to be talking about hypothetical troop levels or changes in command structure coming down the stretch.
[01:17:20.972 --> 01:17:22.612]  And I'll tell you why I made that decision.
[01:17:23.433 --> 01:17:32.198]  I made that decision because I think it sends a bad signal to our troops that they think the commander-in-chief is constantly adjusting tactics and decisions based upon politics.
[01:17:32.498 --> 01:17:32.858]  All right.
[01:17:33.860 --> 01:17:34.841]  We're recording all of it.
[01:17:34.861 --> 01:17:39.623]  We'll play more of it later in the next hour or two, and then, of course, tomorrow.
[01:17:39.763 --> 01:17:41.924]  But, I mean, I'm writing notes here with all the lies.
[01:17:41.944 --> 01:17:44.005]  We're going to come back and get Greg Palast's take on this.
[01:17:44.806 --> 01:17:52.469]  I totally forgot we had him holding while I was going to this live Bush speech, and I apologize, but we had Rumsfeld step down the last 15 minutes.
[01:17:53.210 --> 01:17:58.653]  We've had him announce the former CIA director who runs a giant brainwashing camp up at Texas A&M.
[01:17:59.033 --> 01:17:59.793]  Nothing against A&M.
[01:17:59.813 --> 01:18:01.634]  It's a good university, but it's been totally taken over.
[01:18:01.654 --> 01:18:03.375]  It's a huge spook center now of
[01:18:04.581 --> 01:18:07.284]  We're pushing for the destruction of this country and the North American Union.
[01:18:09.065 --> 01:18:14.930]  Bush claims that because Saddam's gone and now the Muslim extremists want to take over, that we've got to stay.
[01:18:15.250 --> 01:18:28.842]  Well, it's this government that put Saddam in, this government that told him to go ahead and attack Iran, go ahead and attack Kuwait, this government that ran 15 years of genocide against the Iraqis, and now has caused the quagmire over there, and they're saying we've got to stay because we caused it.
[01:18:29.753 --> 01:18:30.374]  It's incredible.
[01:18:30.714 --> 01:18:34.299]  And we keep hearing, we've all got to work together, Nancy Pelosi and Bush.
[01:18:34.319 --> 01:18:36.582]  And don't worry, they will against the American people.
[01:18:37.142 --> 01:18:38.364]  I demand he be impeached.
[01:18:38.424 --> 01:18:39.585]  I demand there be hearings.
[01:18:40.026 --> 01:18:42.930]  We'll get Greg Powell's take on the other side, then Bev Harris as well.
[01:18:42.990 --> 01:18:43.350]  Stay with us.
[01:18:54.983 --> 01:18:57.304]  Hi folks, Jack Browning from Midas Resources.
[01:18:57.644 --> 01:18:58.665]  The real money folks.
[01:19:01.947 --> 01:19:03.868]  Let's review a few things from the past year.
[01:19:04.368 --> 01:19:05.348]  November 2003 to November 2004.
[01:19:05.428 --> 01:19:06.809]  The dollars ranged from $9,800 to $10,300.
[01:19:06.849 --> 01:19:07.269]  A 5% increase.
[01:19:07.870 --> 01:19:10.311]  The dollar's value has dropped from $0.96 to $0.70 against the euro.
[01:19:10.331 --> 01:19:13.492]  A 24% decrease in spending power against the gold-backed euro.
[01:19:23.206 --> 01:19:28.830]  Gold has gone from the 390s to the 440s, a 16% increase in real money.
[01:19:29.451 --> 01:19:32.453]  Precious metals are the safe haven in today's hectic marketplace.

[01:19:57.325 --> 01:20:02.950]  Over the last 40 years, we've seen prayer and God thrown out of the schools by decisions of the U.S.
[01:20:02.990 --> 01:20:03.751]  Supreme Court.
[01:20:04.512 --> 01:20:08.836]  Yet on February 29, 1892, in an eyeing-nothing decision of the U.S.
[01:20:08.856 --> 01:20:12.479]  Supreme Court, America was declared a Christian nation.
[01:20:13.460 --> 01:20:18.685]  There is an ongoing assault on your First Amendment right of freedom of religion and freedom of assembly.
[01:20:19.491 --> 01:20:19.731]  That's 1-800-516-8736.

[01:20:56.967 --> 01:20:59.848]  Where are military bases and hazardous waste sites located?
[01:21:00.088 --> 01:21:06.270]  How do you find the best area for solar, average rainfall, fish contamination advisories, and major transportation routes?

[01:22:18.171 --> 01:22:21.893]  In fact, the effectiveness of all the herbs featured on ResearchedHerbs.com
[01:22:22.210 --> 01:22:22.931]  We're good to go.
[01:22:22.951 --> 01:22:23.151]  I think?
[01:22:53.504 --> 01:22:55.687]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:22:56.288 --> 01:22:59.133]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:23:00.375 --> 01:23:01.698]  We've just got him in five minutes.
[01:23:01.718 --> 01:23:02.840]  We appreciate him joining us.
[01:23:02.880 --> 01:23:04.222]  Beth Harris coming up in the next segment.
[01:23:04.302 --> 01:23:07.047]  And your phone calls will track the election fraud that did take place.
[01:23:08.001 --> 01:23:12.325]  Also, they're saying Bush may be able to ram through his immigration open borders policy now.
[01:23:12.365 --> 01:23:13.225]  We'll break that down.
[01:23:13.706 --> 01:23:16.088]  Former CIA director to run the Pentagon.
[01:23:16.148 --> 01:23:22.833]  We have the NSA Air Force General in his uniform running the CIA with Hayden.
[01:23:22.953 --> 01:23:24.735]  This is scary, folks.
[01:23:24.795 --> 01:23:25.736]  Let's go to Greg Palast.
[01:23:25.756 --> 01:23:27.097]  Greg, thank you for joining us.
[01:23:27.357 --> 01:23:29.779]  BBC, ABC reporter, London Guardian writer.
[01:23:30.119 --> 01:23:31.540]  Thanks for coming on with us.
[01:23:31.560 --> 01:23:32.461]  Give us your analysis.
[01:23:32.621 --> 01:23:33.222]  Whoa.
[01:23:33.242 --> 01:23:35.904]  So they decided to throw rummy into the volcano.
[01:23:36.576 --> 01:23:36.756]  Yes.
[01:23:36.776 --> 01:23:39.197]  I couldn't find a virgin or Lynn Cheney.
[01:23:40.737 --> 01:23:41.258]  You know what?
[01:23:42.118 --> 01:23:45.079]  Don Rumsfeld is not commander-in-chief.
[01:23:45.699 --> 01:23:53.161]  Don Rumsfeld did not stand up in front of the United Nations that Saddam had weapons of mass destruction, Mr. General Powell.
[01:23:53.621 --> 01:23:54.302]  You might remember that.
[01:23:55.022 --> 01:24:01.504]  And, you know, it wasn't... The commander-in-chief is the commander.
[01:24:03.461 --> 01:24:06.602]  And if there's someone to be fired over a rack, that's the man.
[01:24:07.262 --> 01:24:09.103]  Now, obviously, they're trying to throw us a bone.
[01:24:09.183 --> 01:24:10.223]  Oh, you've had your revolution.
[01:24:10.283 --> 01:24:11.043]  Go back to sleep.
[01:24:11.763 --> 01:24:17.165]  I mean, what does this mean, though, that he would lop off the head or make Rumsfeld fall on his sword?
[01:24:18.025 --> 01:24:25.567]  Well, actually, my information, in fact, in our manhouse, my new book, I put down that Rumsfeld had already lost all his power.
[01:24:25.987 --> 01:24:29.928]  He was simply a figurehead and a lightning rod to absorb all the ammo.
[01:24:30.678 --> 01:24:31.559]  Of the opposition.
[01:24:31.919 --> 01:24:39.423]  And now this is his final... He had lied himself against the oil company forces controlling the administration.
[01:24:39.823 --> 01:24:44.486]  And Ed Cross, Dick Cheney, that was my inside information, and that was a year and a half ago.
[01:24:44.546 --> 01:24:53.171]  And now they're saying the Iraq Commission, quote, independent, run by Baker, who represents the oil companies, so they're back in full control.
[01:24:53.691 --> 01:24:55.312]  Back complete in full control.
[01:24:56.053 --> 01:24:59.715]  See, this isn't a sop to the Democrats or to the voters.
[01:25:00.845 --> 01:25:06.810]  This is absolutely saying that James Baker will now have complete control of Iraq policy.
[01:25:06.830 --> 01:25:12.914]  And if you don't know James Baker, guys, he is the lawyer for ExxonMobil Corporation.
[01:25:13.254 --> 01:25:15.756]  He is the lawyer for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
[01:25:15.796 --> 01:25:16.716]  There's another great democracy.
[01:25:16.756 --> 01:25:20.999]  He's the guy who blocked the lawsuit by 9-11 victims' families against Saudi Arabia on 9-11.
[01:25:21.059 --> 01:25:23.081]  You got a problem with that, Alex?
[01:25:23.201 --> 01:25:27.364]  What, you're now worried about widows from these attacks?
[01:25:27.384 --> 01:25:27.684]  I thought...
[01:25:28.226 --> 01:25:31.368]  Remember, Ground Zero is supposed to be a profit center, Alex, for the oil companies.
[01:25:31.408 --> 01:25:34.310]  We're not supposed to be crying over widows, right?
[01:25:34.411 --> 01:25:35.651]  Ann Coulter already warned you about that.
[01:25:35.671 --> 01:25:36.172]  I'm sorry.
[01:25:36.412 --> 01:25:37.633]  Now, so here's the thing.
[01:25:38.874 --> 01:25:45.659]  This is just, it is, the oil companies have now said you can't even have Rumsfeld in as a figurehead.
[01:25:45.719 --> 01:25:50.182]  See, now Bush's view is always, he never got rid of people so much as just took away their powers.
[01:25:50.242 --> 01:25:56.386]  Rumsfeld already had his cojones put in a box.
[01:25:56.486 --> 01:25:57.107]  He was gelded.
[01:25:57.765 --> 01:25:58.225]  Already.
[01:25:58.585 --> 01:26:01.266]  Okay, so you have to know that this is just the final move.
[01:26:02.287 --> 01:26:06.689]  So now they needed a sacrificial lamb, and plus, let's not forget the timing of this.
[01:26:07.029 --> 01:26:23.575]  We're in the middle of a very hot vote count in Virginia and in Montana, in which the United States Senate, the balance is on the line, and now the rummy sacrifice wipes out all news and all scrutiny immediately.
[01:26:23.894 --> 01:26:25.575]  Of the games being played in Virginia.
[01:26:25.595 --> 01:26:28.696]  There's 1% of the vote which is uncounted and is sitting there uncounted.
[01:26:28.976 --> 01:26:32.197]  We have massive piles of provisional ballots in Virginia.
[01:26:32.217 --> 01:26:33.757]  That's these bogus baloney ballots.
[01:26:33.777 --> 01:26:35.018]  Yeah, Bev Harris is coming on next.
[01:26:35.038 --> 01:26:37.218]  She says there's big games going on in Virginia.
[01:26:37.559 --> 01:26:37.999]  You bet.
[01:26:38.139 --> 01:26:39.659]  And, you know, so that's off the news.
[01:26:39.699 --> 01:26:42.620]  And the only people and anyone that brings it up and says, well, wait a minute.
[01:26:42.760 --> 01:26:44.481]  Let's forget the Rumsfeld side show.
[01:26:45.011 --> 01:26:49.615]  Okay, we've only got about a minute or two left, Greg, and I've got to get you on later this week.
[01:26:49.635 --> 01:26:51.577]  I appreciate your time, but Nancy Pelosi saying...
[01:27:05.288 --> 01:27:06.789]  She will not allow investigations.
[01:27:06.809 --> 01:27:08.070]  She will not allow impeachment.
[01:27:08.410 --> 01:27:12.513]  Democrats should be, in my opinion, hopping mad, demanding she not be the Speaker then.
[01:27:12.774 --> 01:27:20.239]  How do we, from your study and research and experience, how do we ensure that there are real... What did the President know?
[01:27:20.299 --> 01:27:21.820]  When did he know it about the WMDs?
[01:27:21.900 --> 01:27:22.180]  All of it.
[01:27:22.781 --> 01:27:23.501]  Well, don't worry.
[01:27:23.581 --> 01:27:27.364]  We're going to have the James Baker Commission, so we'll get all the information.
[01:27:27.424 --> 01:27:28.405]  Bush just said that, yeah.
[01:27:28.585 --> 01:27:31.487]  Yes, I mean, and we're supposed to be grateful.
[01:27:31.527 --> 01:27:33.869]  Even the Democrats are saying, well, that's good that we're having this commission.
[01:27:33.889 --> 01:27:33.929]  No...
[01:27:34.901 --> 01:27:37.323]  No, now we're going to have the new Whitewash Commission.
[01:27:37.363 --> 01:27:41.006]  The problem is that there's too many skeletons in the Democrats' closet.
[01:27:41.026 --> 01:27:43.948]  And the last thing that they want to do is start opening up investigations.
[01:27:44.389 --> 01:27:51.975]  I saw this when they were doing the investigations of even illegal donations to Clinton.
[01:27:52.035 --> 01:27:56.018]  Yeah, most of them voted for the war, so it's sick.
[01:27:56.679 --> 01:28:01.683]  Yeah, so basically you've got too many Democratic skeletons in the closet.
[01:28:01.963 --> 01:28:09.106]  So, you know, if you take out the president, you impeach him for lying and covering up, you're going to take out a third of the Democratic senators with him.
[01:28:09.626 --> 01:28:15.608]  I mean, so that's one of the problems is the lockup of the two parties in which they're grinning at each other and keeping the information.
[01:28:16.539 --> 01:28:16.979]  Closed.
[01:28:17.139 --> 01:28:18.380]  Go to gregpalace.com.
[01:28:18.420 --> 01:28:21.100]  I'll have some reports on the election that the news won't give you.
[01:28:21.120 --> 01:28:23.381]  I was about to say, great reports over at gregpalace.com.
[01:28:23.401 --> 01:28:26.502]  We're linked to them right now on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[01:28:26.522 --> 01:28:28.563]  Greg, I want to get you to check in with us again this week.
[01:28:28.823 --> 01:28:29.803]  Thanks for your analysis.
[01:28:29.963 --> 01:28:30.523]  You got it, brother.
[01:28:30.564 --> 01:28:30.844]  Bye.
[01:28:30.884 --> 01:28:31.304]  Take care.
[01:28:31.724 --> 01:28:32.844]  Bev Harris, straight ahead.
[01:28:32.864 --> 01:28:40.927]  Your calls, tons of news, what this means for immigration, what it means for the Second Amendment, the games they're playing in Virginia, and the final Senate seat up for grabs.
[01:28:40.947 --> 01:28:41.327]  Stay with us.
[01:28:43.817 --> 01:28:44.737]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.197 --> 01:28:46.818]  The empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.718 --> 01:28:50.499]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:55.120 --> 01:29:00.561]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network, and I have an urgent message for our listeners.
[01:29:00.981 --> 01:29:05.742]  The mass media keeps telling us that we are the richest, most powerful economy in the world.
[01:29:06.122 --> 01:29:08.763]  If this is true, why can't we pay our bills?
[01:29:09.243 --> 01:29:12.584]  Why is the United States the world's largest debtor nation?
[01:29:13.405 --> 01:29:17.727]  The truth is that we are in the worst debt bubble in our nation's history.
[01:29:18.188 --> 01:29:21.349]  When the bubble bursts, will you be able to feed your family?
[01:29:21.969 --> 01:29:24.811]  When the inevitable crash occurs, will you be ready?
[01:29:25.589 --> 01:29:27.730]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.
[01:29:27.770 --> 01:29:29.731]  That's 1-888-892-6238 for the following two free reports.
[01:29:29.751 --> 01:29:29.811]  U.S.
[01:29:29.831 --> 01:29:31.952]  Debt Bubble Red Alert and Real Estate Crash.
[01:29:31.972 --> 01:29:32.272]  Call 1-888-8XANADU.
[01:29:32.292 --> 01:29:33.453]  That's 1-888-8XANADU.
[01:29:33.473 --> 01:29:34.333]  Ask for George.
[01:29:53.442 --> 01:29:58.047]  The Berkey Security Pack is your one-stop solution for unexpected emergencies.
[01:29:58.247 --> 01:30:02.691]  It provides you with purified water, light, power, and communications ability.
[01:30:02.891 --> 01:30:16.905]  The Security Pack includes a Berkey light water purifier, an LED base, two Berkey sport filtration bottles, the Berkey battery adapter, the Berkey MP solar charger, as well as a backup set of two Black Berkey purification elements.
[01:30:17.125 --> 01:30:36.314]  The Berkey Security Pack is important every day and a must during emergencies because it provides purified water, long-term low-energy lighting, backup battery power for your Berkey LEDs, free long-term solar power for communications devices such as radios, walkie-talkies, and cell phones, as well as power for small applications.
[01:30:36.535 --> 01:30:40.156]  Get the one-stop solution for your emergency and everyday needs.
[01:30:40.316 --> 01:30:42.978]  The Berkey Security Pack, a retail value of $518 for only $399.
[01:30:45.819 --> 01:30:46.299]  We're good to go.
[01:31:10.754 --> 01:31:11.274]  We're good to go.
[01:31:27.346 --> 01:31:27.726]  We're good to go.
[01:31:27.746 --> 01:31:28.246]  We're good to go.
[01:31:28.286 --> 01:31:28.666]  We're good to go.
[01:32:05.191 --> 01:32:07.312]  We're good to go.
[01:32:23.643 --> 01:32:24.784]  I want to talk again about
[01:32:46.701 --> 01:32:47.842]  Standing up to Pelosi.
[01:32:48.283 --> 01:32:56.230]  If you are listening via the internet, you're listening via an AM or FM station, you're listening via shortwave, you're listening via satellite, call everyone you know.
[01:32:56.270 --> 01:32:56.871]  I'm asking you.
[01:32:56.891 --> 01:32:57.872]  Call four or five people.
[01:32:58.112 --> 01:32:59.153]  Email your email list.
[01:32:59.694 --> 01:33:00.995]  Especially Democrats out there.
[01:33:01.525 --> 01:33:02.266]  We're good to go.
[01:33:23.783 --> 01:33:34.585]  With the neocons, they put them into power to go in and wreak havoc so they could later flush them down the drain and basically, like birdcage liner, remove them and put in fresh birdcage liner.
[01:33:34.985 --> 01:33:41.607]  They're having the Iraq Commission that they're calling independent, run by James Baker and Lee Hamilton, both chief neocon whitewashers.
[01:33:42.967 --> 01:33:48.788]  Again, former Secretary of State, Saudi agent with the Bushes, Rockefeller agent.
[01:33:49.913 --> 01:33:51.355]  They are now taking full control.
[01:33:51.395 --> 01:33:54.719]  After getting their agenda through, they're now going to blame it all on the neocons.
[01:33:54.759 --> 01:34:01.187]  Nancy Pelosi saying no investigations, no even discussions of impeachment, no preliminary hearings on impeachment.
[01:34:01.527 --> 01:34:02.949]  And I say she shouldn't be the Speaker.
[01:34:03.350 --> 01:34:04.992]  And I don't care if we get a woman Speaker.
[01:34:05.172 --> 01:34:08.156]  I don't care if it was a eunuch.
[01:34:08.596 --> 01:34:23.967]  I don't care if we get a hermaphrodite in there, as long as they're pro-Constitution, pro-Bill of Rights, and as long as they'll try to punish these neocon criminals for lying about the Iraq War, the White House memo, we've got them dead to rights there, 9-11 cover-ups, all of it!
[01:34:25.348 --> 01:34:29.611]  And I'm asking you, we have record listenership today, the stations are reporting, the internet numbers, everything.
[01:34:30.091 --> 01:34:30.892]  Let's increase that.
[01:34:30.972 --> 01:34:36.276]  Call everybody you know, tell them, tune in, because we'll keep recapping the key analysis and giving you other angles of this.
[01:34:37.243 --> 01:34:39.084]  Right now, Virginia is being contested.
[01:34:39.424 --> 01:34:41.285]  Let's go ahead and go to Bev Harris.
[01:34:42.225 --> 01:34:46.427]  Montana just went to the Democrats, so they've got, it's 50 right now.
[01:34:46.447 --> 01:34:49.808]  They will get 51 if Virginia goes to the Democrat.
[01:34:49.848 --> 01:34:52.109]  They're showing the Democrat is one to two points ahead.
[01:34:52.669 --> 01:35:00.472]  One percent of the vote they're saying hasn't been counted is just sitting there in provisional ballots, being fed in by the federal monitors.
[01:35:00.892 --> 01:35:02.493]  We were out at a polling place yesterday.
[01:35:02.513 --> 01:35:06.034]  One of my, I guess you could call auxiliary crew,
[01:35:06.781 --> 01:35:07.362]  Well, hi there.
[01:35:30.682 --> 01:35:32.643]  Please run through the field.
[01:35:33.064 --> 01:35:36.706]  Clearly there was an even bigger Democratic landslide, according to my analysis.
[01:35:37.046 --> 01:35:40.168]  We did see all the fun and games in the key battleground areas.
[01:35:40.588 --> 01:35:53.675]  I believe, from my analysis, I want you to correct me if I'm wrong, that we did see some stealing, but that the landslide was so big, and the electronic new machines were only in one-third of the country, that they were unable to steal it everywhere.
[01:35:54.015 --> 01:35:55.216]  Bev, tell me if I'm right or wrong.
[01:35:56.301 --> 01:35:57.121]  I'm not sure you're right.
[01:35:57.361 --> 01:36:04.624]  They were actually, computers counted at least 80% of the vote, perhaps as much as 90% of the vote, once you add in the optical scans.
[01:36:05.024 --> 01:36:14.367]  Sure, sure, but I'm saying 35%, Bev, with the new Help America Vote Act, really questionable systems where you don't even have the original paper scantrons to double check.
[01:36:14.707 --> 01:36:15.267]  It doesn't matter.
[01:36:15.687 --> 01:36:18.728]  If you watch Hacking Democracy, you can see we hacked the other system just as well.
[01:36:18.748 --> 01:36:19.928]  You don't look at the paper ballot.
[01:36:19.989 --> 01:36:24.570]  Both systems are equally hackable, and so I don't think that we...
[01:36:25.262 --> 01:36:28.403]  Should look at it as a touchscreen versus optical scan.
[01:36:29.023 --> 01:36:31.344]  The most... Well, sure, I don't want to argue about this.
[01:36:31.684 --> 01:36:36.425]  But at any rate... Bev, Bev, Bev, as you've been doing, I've been covering this a long time.
[01:36:36.646 --> 01:36:38.166]  Let me explain to you why I say that.
[01:36:38.866 --> 01:36:40.907]  The older systems can be hacked.
[01:36:41.007 --> 01:36:43.067]  It's all computerized in the endgame.
[01:36:43.468 --> 01:36:47.249]  But the new systems are controlled by the big four or big five.
[01:36:47.269 --> 01:36:48.249]  So are the old ones.
[01:36:48.529 --> 01:36:49.329]  So are the old ones.
[01:36:49.449 --> 01:36:50.110]  Both systems.
[01:36:50.130 --> 01:36:51.450]  There's no difference, Alex.
[01:36:51.470 --> 01:36:52.710]  Okay, well, break down what we really saw then.
[01:36:52.730 --> 01:36:54.431]  Both systems are controlled by the same four companies.
[01:36:54.907 --> 01:37:00.251]  And both systems are not allowing people to look at the paper ballot, so they're essentially the same.
[01:37:00.432 --> 01:37:02.613]  So they stole it for the Democrats?
[01:37:04.675 --> 01:37:05.936]  Who knows what they've done.
[01:37:06.016 --> 01:37:09.679]  The whole point is that there's no way to authenticate it.
[01:37:09.939 --> 01:37:13.042]  And until we can authenticate it, we have no way of knowing.
[01:37:13.302 --> 01:37:13.662]  I agree.
[01:37:14.403 --> 01:37:21.709]  And by the way, if you accept the premise that elections can be stolen on voting machines and by other means,
[01:37:22.390 --> 01:37:25.891]  Why would we ever think that people wouldn't manipulate primary elections?
[01:37:26.331 --> 01:37:29.532]  Why would we think that Democrats are Democrats and Republicans are Republicans?
[01:37:30.452 --> 01:37:31.112]  Exactly.
[01:37:31.152 --> 01:37:32.612]  They could decide.
[01:37:32.652 --> 01:37:34.353]  They could put their ringers in, you're saying.
[01:37:35.133 --> 01:37:35.473]  Sure.
[01:37:35.733 --> 01:37:44.035]  Look at the kinds of votes that have been taking place, you know, with habeas corpus and so forth.
[01:37:44.055 --> 01:37:45.555]  The Democrats are voting for it, too.
[01:37:45.775 --> 01:37:47.236]  The Democrats in name.
[01:37:47.256 --> 01:37:48.816]  Good point.
[01:37:49.221 --> 01:37:53.102]  Yeah, so I don't think we can just say this is a Democrat versus a Republican issue.
[01:37:53.142 --> 01:38:00.044]  And I think it's going to be very interesting to see which election reform groups decide it's not such a bad problem.
[01:38:00.124 --> 01:38:02.605]  After all, now that they have Democrats in there.
[01:38:02.725 --> 01:38:03.565]  We always said that.
[01:38:03.605 --> 01:38:07.346]  Because I think some of them are actually closet partisans.
[01:38:07.886 --> 01:38:11.687]  The issue here has not changed in the last 24 hours.
[01:38:12.667 --> 01:38:14.708]  Voting machines can't be authenticated.
[01:38:16.232 --> 01:38:16.593]  I think so.
[01:38:32.859 --> 01:38:35.800]  Try to say, well, some Democrats are in there, so now it's okay.
[01:38:36.040 --> 01:38:37.041]  Bev, here's the problem.
[01:38:37.461 --> 01:38:38.201]  Here's the problem.
[01:38:38.781 --> 01:38:42.563]  And I agree with 99.5% of what you're saying, okay?
[01:38:43.103 --> 01:38:46.104]  Maybe, you know, one half of 1% I'm not sure on.
[01:38:46.664 --> 01:38:53.887]  Okay, and again, there's so many facets and so many different pieces of data that go into my analysis, you know, it's hard to even describe.
[01:38:54.227 --> 01:38:55.648]  But let me break this down.
[01:38:56.108 --> 01:39:01.810]  The big four companies have proven themselves to be allied with the Republican machine, the neocon,
[01:39:02.290 --> 01:39:02.811]  Machine.
[01:39:03.031 --> 01:39:03.672]  Three of the four.
[01:39:03.832 --> 01:39:03.972]  Yes.
[01:39:03.992 --> 01:39:04.572]  Three of the four.
[01:39:04.612 --> 01:39:06.574]  The other ones allied with the Democrats, typically.
[01:39:07.475 --> 01:39:10.198]  And look at Chapter 8 of my book.
[01:39:10.858 --> 01:39:15.223]  The major investor in the other one, before it was bought by the Venezuelans... You're talking about Sequoia.
[01:39:15.823 --> 01:39:16.043]  Yes.
[01:39:16.524 --> 01:39:19.707]  The major investor in Sequoia, before it was bought by the Venezuelans,
[01:39:20.347 --> 01:39:23.470]  Had put in $800,000 to the Democratic Party.
[01:39:23.590 --> 01:39:25.692]  I don't think that that's a gray area.
[01:39:25.912 --> 01:39:26.252]  Sure, sure.
[01:39:26.272 --> 01:39:31.677]  Let me just finish this statement, because I know you spend all your time studying this, so you know more than I do.
[01:39:32.037 --> 01:39:34.279]  I've been covering it for a long time, but you live it.
[01:39:34.639 --> 01:39:35.720]  So that's why we've got you here.
[01:39:35.920 --> 01:39:37.362]  But I want to be very careful about this.
[01:39:38.102 --> 01:39:53.069]  Okay, the neocons certainly now, it looks like the James Baker old line, Rockefeller Republicans, are now basically flushing them, using them as sacrificial lambs, scapegoats, whipping boys, whatever you want to call them.
[01:39:53.309 --> 01:39:54.970]  And so I'm tending towards...
[01:39:55.470 --> 01:40:04.735]  I know you're just going off the facts, agreeing with you, and especially Pelosi and Bush being on the same page, saying reconciliation, coming together, working together.
[01:40:05.536 --> 01:40:08.297]  Democrats are talking about putting more troops in.
[01:40:08.437 --> 01:40:16.882]  So this is really frightening, what you're saying, because it's confirming a lot of what our listeners and what I and others have been saying.
[01:40:18.482 --> 01:40:19.223]  And you're right.
[01:40:19.243 --> 01:40:25.945]  We have some Democrats outvoting in some votes, pro-war, pro-end the Bill of Rights, pro-getting rid of posse commentatus.
[01:40:25.985 --> 01:40:27.166]  My God, this is horrible, Bev.
[01:40:28.106 --> 01:40:28.306]  Yeah.
[01:40:28.546 --> 01:40:33.568]  I mean, one-third of the Democrats are voting for that stuff, or were before this.
[01:40:33.608 --> 01:40:36.569]  So, you know, it is more complex.
[01:40:36.869 --> 01:40:43.492]  In fact, at some point, and I certainly haven't done this, someone might want to step back and go, okay, which Democrats got voted in?
[01:40:44.517 --> 01:40:48.802]  And what exactly are the Democrats that got voted in?
[01:40:48.822 --> 01:40:54.668]  Because I keep seeing reports on how these are the people who everyone can get along with.
[01:40:56.170 --> 01:40:57.031]  What does that mean?
[01:40:59.333 --> 01:41:02.397]  So, we've already seen the Democrats vote in the Senate.
[01:41:03.977 --> 01:41:09.902]  Almost 100% for the Military Commissions Act, for the Defense Authorization Act.
[01:41:09.942 --> 01:41:11.264]  It was frankly just as bad.
[01:41:11.284 --> 01:41:16.108]  Erasing governor's power, erasing posse commentatus to put trips on the streets.
[01:41:16.827 --> 01:41:24.412]  And so, really, it does look like an establishment together creating the illusion of choice to continue the agenda.
[01:41:24.472 --> 01:41:27.894]  And out of the gates, Pelosi saying no impeachment investigation.
[01:41:27.914 --> 01:41:30.576]  And I say that vets and proves what you're saying.
[01:41:31.176 --> 01:41:33.578]  And I have been looking at the Democrats that have been winning.
[01:41:33.678 --> 01:41:37.040]  It hasn't been the John Conyers type.
[01:41:37.180 --> 01:41:38.922]  The new one's coming in.
[01:41:39.662 --> 01:41:40.683]  It hasn't been...
[01:41:42.624 --> 01:41:46.708]  Those, the Dennis Kucinich's of the world, I tend to agree with you.
[01:41:46.728 --> 01:41:50.611]  So is this an establishment circling the wagons trying to fool the population?
[01:41:50.651 --> 01:41:51.812]  Well, very possibly.
[01:41:52.432 --> 01:41:56.596]  And, you know, the problem is anything could be going on.
[01:41:57.116 --> 01:42:01.840]  It could also be that there was a huge turnout and it kind of washed away some of the fraud.
[01:42:01.940 --> 01:42:04.943]  And it could also be that there were some zealots
[01:42:05.453 --> 01:42:08.860]  On the Democratic side, doing their own exploits on the machines.
[01:42:08.980 --> 01:42:09.802]  It could be anything.
[01:42:09.862 --> 01:42:11.225]  And that's why we got to say...
[01:42:11.934 --> 01:42:18.797]  Let's take the judgments about who wins and who doesn't out of it and say, well, we have to have a trustworthy voting system.
[01:42:18.817 --> 01:42:19.157]  I agree.
[01:42:19.217 --> 01:42:35.224]  What matters is the integrity of the voting system, and will the huge honesty in elections, paper ballot, the movement to have verified votes, will that now wither on the vine because now the Democrats are feeling like they've had some type of victory?
[01:42:35.905 --> 01:42:37.306]  Well, let me tell you something.
[01:42:37.326 --> 01:42:45.192]  Supposing I was really wanting to make sure that I could control elections through voting machines, I would probably throw a fight now and then.
[01:42:46.594 --> 01:42:52.318]  Because right now, we had so much momentum going to get real change.
[01:42:52.979 --> 01:42:57.102]  And if you then make it look like, well, there's nothing to look at here, move along.
[01:42:57.182 --> 01:42:57.442]  I agree.
[01:43:00.491 --> 01:43:04.795]  Then we won't get it fixed by 2008.
[01:43:04.835 --> 01:43:08.618]  The problem is selling that truth to the Democrats and to others.
[01:43:08.678 --> 01:43:11.840]  Now we can get the Republicans probably to start believing it.
[01:43:11.920 --> 01:43:13.662]  But, yeah, they saw a landslide.
[01:43:13.942 --> 01:43:15.223]  They'd stolen the last two.
[01:43:16.024 --> 01:43:17.665]  But people weren't looking like they were now.
[01:43:17.765 --> 01:43:22.389]  Everybody was looking, 90-plus percent, not trusting the machines, most of those being Democrats.
[01:43:22.769 --> 01:43:26.692]  Now we convince them it's legitimate by throwing it the other way.
[01:43:27.469 --> 01:43:30.552]  Well, we have to look at that as a possibility.
[01:43:30.952 --> 01:43:34.976]  And the other thing is, we don't have any idea what really happened with those machines.
[01:43:35.136 --> 01:43:36.097]  I do know one thing.
[01:43:36.157 --> 01:43:42.303]  I got more complaints, and they were substantive complaints, than I ever have in any election since I've been doing this.
[01:43:42.836 --> 01:43:49.542]  And the next step is doing what we did in 2004, getting the audit logs and the machine logs to find out what really happened.
[01:43:49.562 --> 01:43:50.062]  That's the key.
[01:43:50.102 --> 01:43:52.464]  In fact, that's the thing I was thinking about earlier.
[01:43:53.105 --> 01:44:00.551]  Record problems, machines even in Austin not working in the morning, shutting down, weird flipping, problems everywhere.
[01:44:00.751 --> 01:44:05.054]  Is that indicative, and I believe it has been in the past, of them manipulating the vote?
[01:44:05.154 --> 01:44:06.796]  And we saw record, quote, problems?
[01:44:07.236 --> 01:44:15.622]  Oh, you know, we are seeing problems that we have to get some answers to, such as in the optical scan machines.
[01:44:16.002 --> 01:44:22.247]  People feeding in ballots, wife, husband, friend, and the number is supposed to increment each time.
[01:44:22.427 --> 01:44:23.627]  How many ballots were counted?
[01:44:23.668 --> 01:44:32.133]  We got calls in Austin, Ohio, Tennessee, everywhere, saying they would feed it and the number wouldn't change, and they watched five people go ahead of them and it wouldn't change.
[01:44:32.213 --> 01:44:33.334]  Yeah, I saw that everywhere.
[01:44:33.354 --> 01:44:35.796]  And we also have reports, credible reports,
[01:44:36.178 --> 01:44:38.843]  When they would run the zero report in the morning, it wasn't zero.
[01:44:39.083 --> 01:44:48.159]  I mean, these are things that we can say, oh, it's a glitch, let's move on, we've got the result that we want, but they have to be investigated just as if
[01:44:48.740 --> 01:44:49.841]  Republicans had won.
[01:44:49.861 --> 01:44:51.602]  It doesn't matter to me who wins.
[01:44:51.682 --> 01:44:53.944]  In fact, sometimes I don't even feel like turning on the news.
[01:44:53.964 --> 01:44:56.446]  It's like, let me see what really happened.
[01:44:56.886 --> 01:44:58.548]  Yeah, these machines are fraudulent.
[01:44:58.568 --> 01:44:59.809]  They've been designed for fraud.
[01:44:59.849 --> 01:45:01.030]  Engineers have gone public.
[01:45:01.050 --> 01:45:02.150]  They must be removed.
[01:45:02.291 --> 01:45:04.312]  And so the final question is, how do we do that?
[01:45:04.712 --> 01:45:04.832]  Right.
[01:45:05.233 --> 01:45:11.057]  And so what we need to do next is go ahead and continue what we were doing, which is getting hard proof.
[01:45:11.618 --> 01:45:16.982]  And the hard proof is going to come out when we start saying, okay, let's get some records from these machines.
[01:45:17.446 --> 01:45:18.326]  And show what happened.
[01:45:18.386 --> 01:45:26.290]  We already know that in San Diego in June, the voting machine dialed out and set up a remote connection with Diebold at 9.31 p.m.
[01:45:26.310 --> 01:45:27.171]  during the vote count.
[01:45:27.851 --> 01:45:31.373]  So, that's the kind of loss that we need to be getting.
[01:45:31.393 --> 01:45:32.373]  They're set up to dial out.
[01:45:32.473 --> 01:45:34.394]  They're set up to call back to headquarters.
[01:45:35.054 --> 01:45:41.998]  And then you try to look under the hood, and they go completely ape and start suing people, and people in California and the government who blow the whistle go to jail.
[01:45:42.698 --> 01:45:43.178]  Exactly.
[01:45:43.218 --> 01:45:44.359]  Now, let me tell you something else.
[01:45:44.399 --> 01:45:44.979]  In Virginia...
[01:45:45.515 --> 01:45:47.776]  That is looking like it's going to go to a recount.
[01:45:48.296 --> 01:45:55.560]  It could very well control the Senate, and it may come down to voting machines there.
[01:45:55.820 --> 01:46:04.864]  32 counties in Virginia appear to be using machines that we don't think are certified, that had changes to the software that didn't go back to testing.
[01:46:06.185 --> 01:46:11.948]  So it's going to be very interesting to see what happens in Virginia, in fact, because
[01:46:12.685 --> 01:46:16.868]  I think that's one of the areas where there actually will be more scrutiny.
[01:46:17.828 --> 01:46:23.872]  And they're going to start looking under every rock and under every leaf to see that it really was counted correctly.
[01:46:23.973 --> 01:46:28.816]  And what you've got in Virginia is paperless touchscreens from a company that doesn't appear to be certified.
[01:46:28.876 --> 01:46:29.076]  Oops.
[01:46:29.696 --> 01:46:31.758]  And who does it appear that company's allied with?
[01:46:32.058 --> 01:46:36.601]  Ah, it's in Texas, and this is Advanced Voting Solutions out of Plano, Texas.
[01:46:37.031 --> 01:46:37.611]  Same crowd.
[01:46:37.691 --> 01:46:41.554]  Actually, a lot of the guys there are the old crowd from Global Election Systems.
[01:46:41.574 --> 01:46:44.736]  When Global Election Systems, of course, is the company that Diebold bought.
[01:46:45.497 --> 01:46:47.738]  And so that's what they do.
[01:46:47.758 --> 01:46:52.882]  Yeah, there's lots of shadow groups creating the illusion of choice, but really it's the same crew.
[01:46:53.462 --> 01:46:55.644]  Oh, yeah, a tremendous cross-pollination.
[01:46:55.884 --> 01:46:56.925]  I know that group.
[01:46:56.965 --> 01:47:01.748]  That's tied into A&M and the former CIA director who's now our defense secretary.
[01:47:01.768 --> 01:47:01.908]  Okay.
[01:47:04.457 --> 01:47:06.497]  So I wouldn't count anything out.
[01:47:07.017 --> 01:47:12.299]  I definitely think that there's going to be a lot of, okay, it's all right now, let's not look at this anymore.
[01:47:12.459 --> 01:47:18.641]  And as far as I'm concerned, if that's what people are going to do, then they really weren't serious about getting this issue solved anyway.
[01:47:18.701 --> 01:47:20.522]  They were just looking at it for partisan purposes.
[01:47:21.062 --> 01:47:24.723]  Because nothing's changed as far as the tamperability and the
[01:47:25.336 --> 01:47:27.457]  Yeah, we'll be doing a lot of work on getting those records.
[01:47:27.537 --> 01:47:28.918]  It may, unfortunately, take more than a couple days.
[01:47:49.400 --> 01:47:55.483]  We'll only be able to get them in a few days if some candidates will help us with the records request.
[01:47:55.583 --> 01:48:01.687]  We'll all watch blackboxvoting.org and go get your checklist on how to be an activist and how to get involved.
[01:48:02.207 --> 01:48:03.348]  The fight is not over.
[01:48:03.448 --> 01:48:04.808]  It has just begun.
[01:48:04.848 --> 01:48:13.113]  This looks like really sophisticated theater to make us think that we're having an effect as they desperately try to maintain control of the oligarchy that owns both parties.
[01:48:13.413 --> 01:48:14.634]  Bev Harris, thank you for joining us.
[01:48:14.674 --> 01:48:14.954]  Thank you.
[01:48:15.334 --> 01:48:15.754]  God bless.
[01:48:15.774 --> 01:48:17.755]  All right, amazing interview there.
[01:48:17.795 --> 01:48:19.896]  We'll take some calls when we get back at about 8 after.
[01:48:19.916 --> 01:48:24.338]  In the next hour, we'll have Aaron Russo on with us to give us his take on all the things that are happening.
[01:48:24.358 --> 01:48:25.399]  We'll continue with open phones.
[01:48:25.459 --> 01:48:28.700]  Dan and Noel and Chris and who's after Chris?
[01:48:29.320 --> 01:48:32.261]  Sasha and many, many others that are patiently holding.
[01:48:32.302 --> 01:48:33.142]  We will get to you.
[01:48:34.201 --> 01:48:35.842]  Before I end this segment, listen.
[01:48:36.282 --> 01:48:39.564]  Terror Storm went into the top ten of Amazon.com.
[01:48:39.724 --> 01:48:40.205]  It's $11.19.
[01:48:40.605 --> 01:48:42.826]  I want to push it to number one.
[01:48:43.186 --> 01:48:44.127]  It's about to leave the top 100.
[01:48:44.867 --> 01:48:45.848]  Please go in there.
[01:48:46.408 --> 01:48:47.289]  They have it in stock.
[01:48:47.921 --> 01:48:50.262]  For some reason, it says four to six weeks.
[01:48:50.282 --> 01:48:50.963]  That is not true.
[01:48:50.983 --> 01:48:52.044]  They're supposed to take that down.
[01:48:52.424 --> 01:48:53.604]  Go order a bunch of copies.
[01:48:53.685 --> 01:48:54.425]  Give it to people.
[01:48:54.845 --> 01:48:55.946]  I want to send it to number one.
[01:48:55.986 --> 01:48:59.028]  That's really going to help us in the promotion in stores and around the country.
[01:48:59.068 --> 01:49:03.731]  This is a key place you can help get 9-11 truth out and expose the murdering terrorists that carried out 9-11.

[01:49:26.006 --> 01:49:26.046]  888-253-3139.
[01:49:34.597 --> 01:49:35.578]  I want to get into immigration.
[01:49:35.618 --> 01:49:36.959]  I want to get into what this election means.
[01:49:36.979 --> 01:49:37.979]  I want to get into Virginia.
[01:49:38.019 --> 01:49:39.000]  I want to get into your calls.
[01:49:39.060 --> 01:49:43.422]  It's going to be so jam-packed with little info factoids for you.
[01:49:43.482 --> 01:49:45.504]  But again, Amazon.com.

[01:49:48.325 --> 01:49:49.166]  Don't let them stop us.
[01:49:49.186 --> 01:49:49.766]  We'll be right back.
[01:49:56.650 --> 01:49:59.791]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[01:50:00.172 --> 01:50:02.072]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[01:50:02.472 --> 01:50:10.136]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:50:10.796 --> 01:50:17.859]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:50:18.259 --> 01:50:21.200]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran.
[01:50:21.581 --> 01:50:23.901]  A White House program to disseminate fake news.
[01:50:24.322 --> 01:50:25.142]  NSA spies.
[01:50:26.555 --> 01:50:29.676]  The latest 9-11 information and much, much more.
[01:50:29.996 --> 01:50:33.477]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:50:33.957 --> 01:50:35.858]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:50:36.218 --> 01:50:40.139]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:50:54.266 --> 01:50:55.247]  Good morning, honey.
[01:50:55.608 --> 01:51:01.614]  Wow, the weather is beautiful, the cabin is terrific, and it's the first day of our vacation.
[01:51:01.894 --> 01:51:02.495]  Yeah.
[01:51:02.875 --> 01:51:04.297]  Honey, is there something wrong?
[01:51:04.657 --> 01:51:08.061]  Yeah, I just realized we forgot to pack the travel perky system.
[01:51:08.522 --> 01:51:10.023]  I can't drink this cabin water.
[01:51:10.464 --> 01:51:12.186]  And what am I going to do when I'm out on the lake?
[01:51:12.566 --> 01:51:14.308]  Now the whole vacation is ruined.
[01:51:14.508 --> 01:51:15.428]  Honey, cheer up.
[01:51:15.788 --> 01:51:18.049]  I brought our Sport Berkey Purifiers.
[01:51:18.329 --> 01:51:18.629]  What?
[01:51:19.069 --> 01:51:29.533]  Yeah, I know you're picky about not having pathogenic bacteria, organic chemicals, heavy metals or foul tastes and odors in the water, so I packed our Sport Berkey Purifiers.
[01:51:29.833 --> 01:51:30.073]  You know?
[01:51:30.533 --> 01:51:34.696]  This is a terrific cabin, and wow, have you noticed the beautiful weather?
[01:51:34.996 --> 01:51:36.177]  Don't ruin your vacation.

[01:51:40.399 --> 01:51:41.760]  Travel Berkey, not available in Iowa.
[01:51:53.112 --> 01:52:01.056]  For years, you've been hearing about Herbal Healer Academy and how it's remained the leader in effective alternative and natural medicine and education.
[01:52:01.517 --> 01:52:04.679]  But how can they continue to hold that title for years on end?
[01:52:05.059 --> 01:52:08.100]  The answer is high quality and huge selection.
[01:52:08.501 --> 01:52:13.303]  Just visit HerbalHealer.com and shop online or request a free catalog.
[01:52:13.744 --> 01:52:16.085]  You're bound to find the alternative you're looking for.
[01:52:16.835 --> 01:52:21.476]  Did you know that Herbal Healer carries the latest, safest and effective weight loss products?
[01:52:22.016 --> 01:52:27.878]  You can also count on Herbal Healer for the largest selection of safe and natural supplements just for children.
[01:52:28.198 --> 01:52:29.338]  And don't forget your pets.
[01:52:29.818 --> 01:52:35.460]  Herbal Healer even has natural mineral supplements for all your animals, including horses, cows and birds.
[01:52:35.956 --> 01:52:36.476]  We're good to go.
[01:52:36.496 --> 01:52:36.737]  I think?
[01:53:05.297 --> 01:53:11.440]  Robert Gates, the big CIA spook, who we'll tell you more about in the next hour, will be the new Secretary of Defense.
[01:53:11.961 --> 01:53:21.686]  We have an Air Force General, former NSA head, National Security Agency, wearing his uniform, first time ever, the military openly running the CIA.
[01:53:22.006 --> 01:53:23.006]  It's just spookville.
[01:53:24.767 --> 01:53:30.050]  This is the oil company taking full control, and like I said, removing the neocons, kind of his birdcage liner.
[01:53:30.896 --> 01:53:32.197]  Now, will they go into Iran?
[01:53:32.217 --> 01:53:33.118]  Will they stage some event?
[01:53:33.138 --> 01:53:37.582]  Or will they back off a little bit, getting their new martial law powers, abolishing the Bill of Rights?
[01:53:37.602 --> 01:53:44.608]  Will they kind of just sit tight now while quietly building their infrastructure, putting CIA commanders over every major police department in the country?
[01:53:44.628 --> 01:53:45.329]  That's been announced.
[01:53:46.439 --> 01:53:51.562]  All sorts of tattletale programs moving forward with their whole agenda, consolidating the gains they've made.
[01:53:52.102 --> 01:53:54.344]  The news is reporting maybe the Democrats will help Bush.
[01:53:54.364 --> 01:54:00.107]  The Republican obstructionist in the House wouldn't give him his amnesty program, his guest worker.
[01:54:00.647 --> 01:54:02.188]  Wouldn't give him this, wouldn't give him that.
[01:54:02.208 --> 01:54:03.749]  And exactly, the Democrats that have gone in...
[01:54:04.409 --> 01:54:14.151]  I mean, hell, the Republicans and the Democrats go around, all these former CIA guys, former Justice Department, former DEA, FBI, most are sheriffs, most are county judges or spooks they put in.
[01:54:14.651 --> 01:54:17.412]  I mean, if they can do that at the local level, absolutely.
[01:54:17.432 --> 01:54:18.932]  I agree with Bev Evers' analysis.
[01:54:19.553 --> 01:54:20.273]  It's really sad.
[01:54:20.293 --> 01:54:25.734]  There was a big landslide for the Democrats, but I think they stole the election and only gave it to establishment types.
[01:54:27.234 --> 01:54:29.695]  Clearly, that's what's happening, and it's disgusting.
[01:54:30.806 --> 01:54:31.166]  It is.
[01:54:31.206 --> 01:54:34.509]  We've just got to continue exposing the terrorists, continue getting the word out.
[01:54:35.270 --> 01:54:38.032]  We're having a lot of victories right now, and that's why they're having to juggle things.
[01:54:38.432 --> 01:54:39.914]  Dan in Arizona, go ahead.
[01:54:39.934 --> 01:54:40.554]  You're on the air.
[01:54:41.095 --> 01:54:41.695]  Hey, Alex.
[01:54:41.715 --> 01:54:42.956]  This is Dan.
[01:54:43.577 --> 01:54:45.018]  I'm a 9-11 Truth Tucson member.
[01:54:45.378 --> 01:54:45.678]  Welcome.
[01:54:46.059 --> 01:54:46.419]  Thank you.
[01:54:47.480 --> 01:54:54.886]  Yeah, just in case there's any doubt in anybody's minds about whether Pelosi's not wired into the cabal, pulled up a
[01:54:55.379 --> 01:55:03.627]  An article on CNS News this morning, reporting on her noontime remarks, where she says Bush should replace Rumsfeld for starters.
[01:55:04.548 --> 01:55:12.636]  And she must be prescient, but she also comments on a brief conversation earlier this morning with President Bush where they wish to work in a bipartisan way.
[01:55:12.656 --> 01:55:14.698]  I think it's more like she was handed her script.
[01:55:15.879 --> 01:55:17.900]  No, no, that's it.
[01:55:17.960 --> 01:55:30.449]  I mean, day one, she went on 60 Minutes and said, we won't impeach Bush, and she's going to be in there like Newt Gingrich to ride herd over the Democrats, and a lot of the Democrats will suddenly become anti-gun again.
[01:55:30.829 --> 01:55:35.733]  They will suddenly start loving the New World Order because they've got their precious queen bee.
[01:55:37.254 --> 01:55:39.255]  Yep, and a quick question for you.
[01:55:39.635 --> 01:55:43.438]  I was actually able to get onto a conservative talk radio here in Tucson yesterday morning.
[01:55:43.558 --> 01:55:44.999]  Fake conservative, you mean?
[01:55:45.410 --> 01:55:46.391]  Well, yeah.
[01:55:46.431 --> 01:55:53.976]  I announced myself as a disgruntled conservative and a 9-11 skeptic with a lot of questions about the war on terror.
[01:55:53.996 --> 01:55:59.920]  I also announced our event with James Fetzer here in town at the Rialto on the 12th.
[01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:09.206]  As soon as I got off and somebody else called in, they immediately just labeled me as a load of bull and I was a Democrat plant.
[01:56:09.246 --> 01:56:13.009]  Of course, the host rather agreed with them and that they could do nothing to control that.
[01:56:13.429 --> 01:56:15.110]  I've been dying to call back in with
[01:56:15.831 --> 01:56:18.353]  You know, it wasn't a load of bull.
[01:56:18.513 --> 01:56:19.333]  That's what I am.
[01:56:19.573 --> 01:56:20.474]  That's what I think.
[01:56:20.794 --> 01:56:30.501]  And I was just wondering if you could... I know there's a lot of others out there like me, and maybe just to let them know they're not alone, you could tell me how you combat that kind of...
[01:56:32.106 --> 01:56:43.916]  Out of the gates you say, I'm against the amnesty program, I'm against Bush signing on to UNESCO with UN regulations to run our federal agencies, I'm against Bush tripling the size of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms.
[01:56:44.297 --> 01:56:46.098]  Most phony conservatives don't even know what that is.
[01:56:47.099 --> 01:56:58.288]  You come out of the gates saying that Bush vacations with the Clintons and he's a surrogate member of the family, and that Rupert Murdoch, of course, vacations and hangs out with Hillary.
[01:56:58.308 --> 01:56:59.950]  You're already way over their heads, yeah.
[01:57:00.370 --> 01:57:01.671]  And they'll go, that's liberal too!
[01:57:01.911 --> 01:57:02.732]  Hillary's good!
[01:57:02.772 --> 01:57:03.512]  You're a commie!
[01:57:03.672 --> 01:57:07.054]  Oh yeah, if you can't march goose step with them, you're not allowed into the clubhouse.
[01:57:07.254 --> 01:57:10.076]  Number one, you need to tell them they're not real conservatives.
[01:57:10.997 --> 01:57:13.778]  And then you just fire out Infowars.com on them.
[01:57:14.119 --> 01:57:14.559]  There you go.
[01:57:14.799 --> 01:57:15.359]  Alright, great.
[01:57:15.379 --> 01:57:15.699]  Thanks a lot.
[01:57:15.720 --> 01:57:16.360]  I appreciate it.
[01:57:16.400 --> 01:57:18.721]  Yeah, I mean, look, these guys are hired to be whores.
[01:57:19.402 --> 01:57:27.807]  They're hired to sit there and repeat, like a parrot, squawking and bleeding the same message ad nauseum over and over again to keep you in the left-right paradigm.
[01:57:28.470 --> 01:57:32.494]  Now we'll see if Republicans and Democrats can wake up and save the country.
[01:57:33.896 --> 01:57:38.120]  Order a copy of this show for your friends and family at GCNlive.com or call 877-300-7645.
[01:57:49.688 --> 01:57:50.348]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.008 --> 01:57:52.089]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:52.769 --> 01:57:53.869]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.550 --> 01:57:55.350]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.110 --> 01:57:57.010]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.030 --> 01:58:01.452]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:01.852 --> 01:58:05.973]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:06.173 --> 01:58:12.336]  In this show, we're going to break down who Robert Gates is, former CIA director.
[01:58:14.436 --> 01:58:16.657]  The fact that the traitor Pelosi is saying she's going to
[01:58:17.728 --> 01:58:20.390]  Ride herd on the Democrats and make sure there's no investigations.
[01:58:20.430 --> 01:58:21.551]  The New World Order continues.
[01:58:21.611 --> 01:58:28.635]  No repeal of the provisions of the Patriot Act or the Military Commissions Act or the Defense Appropriations Act.
[01:58:28.815 --> 01:58:31.197]  All the overturning of the Bill of Rights to continue.
[01:58:31.217 --> 01:58:36.120]  Aaron Russo is going to join us to give his take on the election.
[01:58:36.140 --> 01:58:37.241]  We'll continue with open phones.
[01:58:37.741 --> 01:58:40.023]  Noel in New York, then Chris, Sasha, and others.
[01:58:40.063 --> 01:58:40.723]  Go ahead, Noel.
[01:58:41.024 --> 01:58:42.124]  Hi, Alex.
[01:58:42.184 --> 01:58:45.987]  Listen, I'm a first-time caller, but a long-time listener and a researcher and all your stuff.
[01:58:46.363 --> 01:58:49.124]  I'm going to tell you, man, this is show.
[01:58:49.144 --> 01:58:50.605]  This is Hollywood at its best.
[01:58:51.045 --> 01:58:57.768]  I mean, for hard to say two weeks ago that it was no, you know, payback in getting Mr. Bush, because he is a traitor.
[01:58:58.989 --> 01:59:00.069]  So the game goes on.
[01:59:00.109 --> 01:59:07.433]  You know, it's like the Democrats won, but you're getting the same CFR group back into, you know, it's the game just keeps recycling.
[01:59:07.493 --> 01:59:09.894]  It's the same old smoke and mirrors.
[01:59:10.336 --> 01:59:12.537]  And there's three things for this country to really change.
[01:59:12.837 --> 01:59:16.198]  You know, people like you and other people that brings out the truth.
[01:59:16.458 --> 01:59:19.219]  Because I don't look at mainstream media no more.
[01:59:19.259 --> 01:59:20.080]  That's dead to me.
[01:59:21.100 --> 01:59:23.981]  First of all, you have to abolish the Federal Reserve Bank.
[01:59:24.041 --> 01:59:28.102]  And as long as that bank functions, we're never going to get out of this mess.
[01:59:28.643 --> 01:59:32.004]  Number two, these traders... That's why I've got Aaron Russo coming up, by the way.
[01:59:32.024 --> 01:59:32.464]  But go ahead.
[01:59:32.964 --> 01:59:37.826]  That's why these traders need to be beheaded in front of 1600 to get back our capital.
[01:59:38.342 --> 01:59:38.903]  We're good to go.
[01:59:52.734 --> 01:59:55.115]  The games continued, the lies, the fraud.
[01:59:55.135 --> 01:59:57.015]  That's why I don't believe in this election today.
[01:59:57.395 --> 02:00:00.576]  This has all been a set up so it could calm down the American viewers.
[02:00:00.797 --> 02:00:00.997]  See?
[02:00:01.177 --> 02:00:01.677]  It's changed.
[02:00:01.957 --> 02:00:03.237]  You could really change this country.
[02:00:03.677 --> 02:00:06.498]  And meanwhile... But the agenda stays the same.
[02:00:06.998 --> 02:00:08.919]  Of course, you know, Bush and all of them are just puppets.
[02:00:09.239 --> 02:00:12.020]  You wouldn't go to Pennsylvania Avenue.
[02:00:12.240 --> 02:00:14.261]  You'd go to London, England and grab Lord Rothschild.
[02:00:14.721 --> 02:00:16.701]  You'd go to New York and grab David Rockefeller.
[02:00:16.781 --> 02:00:17.642]  Those are the criminals.
[02:00:17.962 --> 02:00:21.563]  Those are the guys that need to be beheaded because they sold this country out.
[02:00:22.103 --> 02:00:23.204]  I appreciate your call.
[02:00:23.604 --> 02:00:25.165]  Let me just say this.
[02:00:25.205 --> 02:00:28.207]  I'm not going to sit here and call for beheading people on air.
[02:00:28.807 --> 02:00:31.709]  And if I ever did that, I'd be arrested in about five minutes.
[02:00:48.257 --> 02:00:49.638]  But they do need to be arrested.
[02:00:49.658 --> 02:00:50.598]  They do need to be tried.
[02:00:50.638 --> 02:00:52.459]  They do need to be put in prison.
[02:00:52.479 --> 02:00:53.200]  They need to be punished.
[02:00:54.640 --> 02:00:55.301]  They are traitors.
[02:00:55.341 --> 02:00:55.921]  They are enemies.
[02:00:56.421 --> 02:01:00.363]  And Nancy Pelosi just radiates evil and phoniness, and I'm just sick of all of them.
[02:01:01.784 --> 02:01:02.644]  I'm so sick of them.
[02:01:03.765 --> 02:01:05.346]  From the bottom of my heart, I'm sick of them.
[02:01:06.727 --> 02:01:08.287]  From the depths of my soul, I'm sick of them.
[02:01:09.468 --> 02:01:11.629]  And yeah, Bev Harris really just boiled it down.
[02:01:12.830 --> 02:01:17.312]  You can't believe any of the election because it's fraudulent machines, but will the Democrats be able to face that?
[02:01:19.159 --> 02:01:27.146]  And, you know, it's true that the Republicans control three of the big four companies, but look at James Baker coming in and spanking baby Bush.
[02:01:28.407 --> 02:01:32.131]  This is just them putting in one of their, basically their B-string.
[02:01:33.452 --> 02:01:34.513]  And they do recycle it.
[02:01:35.313 --> 02:01:36.434]  This is how they get away with it.
[02:01:36.895 --> 02:01:38.076]  Let's talk to Chris in Texas.
[02:01:38.116 --> 02:01:38.897]  Chris, thanks for holding.
[02:01:38.917 --> 02:01:39.217]  Go ahead.
[02:01:42.574 --> 02:01:47.357]  Texas yesterday, and how these parallel elections work, we print out a ballot just like the regular one.
[02:01:47.657 --> 02:01:51.480]  We ask the people to step aside, take their time, fill it out exactly as they did.
[02:01:51.520 --> 02:01:54.962]  So it's more accurate than exit polls, in my opinion, because you're not being pressured to answer it.
[02:01:55.443 --> 02:02:01.507]  So we had about, I'm guessing, 18 to 20 percent of the total turnout in that location.
[02:02:01.847 --> 02:02:06.950]  We stay there and count the ballots that night, and the public's welcome to come and watch us.
[02:02:07.411 --> 02:02:10.673]  And I wanted to say, after we counted all those ballots...
[02:02:11.152 --> 02:02:13.933]  It was an anti-Republican election.
[02:02:14.233 --> 02:02:18.055]  When there was a Republican against a Libertarian, Libertarians blew them away.
[02:02:18.195 --> 02:02:18.995]  Stay there, stay there.
[02:02:19.035 --> 02:02:20.836]  You did vote rescue here in Austin?
[02:02:21.096 --> 02:02:21.556]  Yes, sir.
[02:02:22.056 --> 02:02:26.618]  Okay, Aaron Russo's coming up, but I want people to hear what happened when you did a parallel election.
[02:02:27.218 --> 02:02:28.098]  Who was really winning?
[02:02:29.159 --> 02:02:31.880]  This is the type of research that's going to bring the globalists down.
[02:02:31.920 --> 02:02:34.761]  So you were working with Vicki Karp and others here locally.
[02:02:34.821 --> 02:02:35.501]  Stay with us.
[02:02:36.201 --> 02:02:38.662]  A massive third hour, the last 55 minutes.
[02:02:39.183 --> 02:02:40.343]  Very important coming up.
[02:02:48.477 --> 02:02:51.658]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[02:02:52.018 --> 02:02:53.939]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[02:02:54.299 --> 02:03:01.981]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:03:02.641 --> 02:03:09.703]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:03:10.103 --> 02:03:13.024]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran.
[02:03:13.424 --> 02:03:15.745]  A White House program to disseminate fake news.
[02:03:16.165 --> 02:03:16.985]  NSA spies.
[02:03:17.558 --> 02:03:18.859]  Or by calling toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[02:03:18.919 --> 02:03:20.819]  Or watch it right now online at prisonplanet.tv.
[02:03:45.574 --> 02:03:49.138]  Do you know where the 78 potentially active volcanoes in the U.S.
[02:03:49.178 --> 02:03:49.678]  are located?
[02:03:49.899 --> 02:03:53.282]  And do you know the locations of the top 300 prime terrorist targets?
[02:03:53.502 --> 02:03:58.207]  You can find these answers and more in the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA.
[02:03:58.507 --> 02:04:03.512]  With the more than 50 interactive parameters, you can pinpoint natural and man-made disaster areas.
[02:04:03.752 --> 02:04:04.333]  We're good to go.
[02:04:23.046 --> 02:04:25.086]  That's 888-803-4438 to order on the web or at berkeywater.com.
[02:04:45.788 --> 02:04:48.210]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network.
[02:04:48.710 --> 02:04:52.033]  Let's ask the question that the Bush regime hopes you will never ask.
[02:04:52.393 --> 02:04:55.355]  That is, is the USA already bankrupt?
[02:04:55.616 --> 02:05:02.001]  As the world's biggest debtor nation, we are borrowing in excess of 80% of the world's net savings.
[02:05:02.081 --> 02:05:06.484]  That's $2 billion per day to finance the biggest deficit in history.
[02:05:06.704 --> 02:05:11.066]  Our creditors are becoming increasingly concerned that the debt can never be repaid.
[02:05:11.226 --> 02:05:13.847]  Japan and China, two of the largest holders of U.S.
[02:05:13.867 --> 02:05:16.628]  debt, are looking to greatly reduce their exposure to dollars.
[02:05:17.088 --> 02:05:19.629]  In fact, China has privately hinted that a U.S.
[02:05:19.669 --> 02:05:23.931]  attack on Iran could result in China dumping massive amounts of U.S.
[02:05:23.971 --> 02:05:24.831]  Treasury bonds.
[02:05:25.111 --> 02:05:29.734]  To find out more about this, call for a free report on the coming dollar collapse.
[02:05:29.914 --> 02:05:34.696]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.
[02:05:34.976 --> 02:05:43.361]  That's 1-888-8XANADU or 1-888-8XANADU and ask for George.
[02:05:45.042 --> 02:05:50.084]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:05:50.445 --> 02:05:52.726]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:05:53.914 --> 02:05:55.655]  Continue our election coverage.
[02:05:55.676 --> 02:05:58.798]  Aaron Russo coming up later to give us his take on what's happening.
[02:05:58.818 --> 02:06:01.100]  We already had Beth Harris and Greg Palestine.
[02:06:02.381 --> 02:06:03.902]  Talk about this new defense secretary.
[02:06:04.222 --> 02:06:04.823]  None of it matters.
[02:06:04.843 --> 02:06:05.624]  They're all globalists.
[02:06:06.084 --> 02:06:10.327]  Nancy Pelosi hijacking the Democratic whim, saying we're not going to be going after Bush.
[02:06:10.347 --> 02:06:11.548]  Nothing's going to get repealed.
[02:06:11.869 --> 02:06:13.590]  The police state just moves forward.
[02:06:14.231 --> 02:06:19.575]  And suddenly you'll probably see Democrats who were against Bush supporting Patriot Act, Military Commissions Act,
[02:06:20.794 --> 02:06:22.295]  I want to hear from Democrats out there.
[02:06:22.815 --> 02:06:23.815]  Are you going to put up with this?
[02:06:23.855 --> 02:06:24.796]  Are you going to go along with this?
[02:06:26.336 --> 02:06:27.437]  Are you going to play ball now?
[02:06:28.678 --> 02:06:31.539]  Do you care about election integrity now that they threw you this bone?
[02:06:32.959 --> 02:06:35.601]  There have been parallel elections held around the country.
[02:06:36.261 --> 02:06:40.002]  Exit polls showed bigger Democrat and third party wins than even we were being told.
[02:06:41.523 --> 02:06:45.665]  That's why I'm saying it looks like it was skewed towards Republicans, but they just couldn't hold back the landslide.
[02:06:46.045 --> 02:06:47.846]  But we can never know because there's so much fraud.
[02:06:49.013 --> 02:06:52.136]  Let's go ahead and go to the caller.
[02:06:52.817 --> 02:06:55.319]  Chris, in Texas, you were part of Vote Rescue here in Austin.
[02:06:55.820 --> 02:07:00.924]  Chris, tell us about what precinct you were at and what you witnessed in the parallel election.
[02:07:02.005 --> 02:07:03.507]  I was at a precinct in Austin.
[02:07:03.527 --> 02:07:04.348]  I forget the numbers.
[02:07:04.368 --> 02:07:05.469]  It was in North Austin.
[02:07:05.549 --> 02:07:07.210]  Actually, Michael McCaul showed up there.
[02:07:08.031 --> 02:07:11.875]  After we counted our ballots, as I said, it was an anti-Republican ballot.
[02:07:13.555 --> 02:07:18.859]  When there was a Democrat against a Republican, the Democrat blew them away.
[02:07:19.019 --> 02:07:22.742]  If it was a Democrat, Republican, and Libertarian, the Democrat blew them away.
[02:07:22.762 --> 02:07:26.825]  If it was only Republican and Libertarian, Libertarians blew them away.
[02:07:27.025 --> 02:07:29.066]  And this was not in just one or two races.
[02:07:29.326 --> 02:07:30.267]  This was everywhere.
[02:07:30.447 --> 02:07:34.089]  David Dewhurst got wiped out by the Democratic, according to our poll.
[02:07:35.711 --> 02:07:38.072]  Perry, Chris Bell got mega votes.
[02:07:38.232 --> 02:07:40.554]  I mean, you could have gave him 50, I mean, you could have gave...
[02:07:41.010 --> 02:07:41.770]  We're good to go.
[02:08:00.919 --> 02:08:02.060]  You're not going to shake my hand?
[02:08:02.560 --> 02:08:03.761]  I said, no, I don't think so.
[02:08:03.881 --> 02:08:06.363]  Then I walked about ten feet away, and I heard them call me a name.
[02:08:06.543 --> 02:08:07.604]  I don't know exactly what it called.
[02:08:07.824 --> 02:08:09.285]  I turned around and said, what'd you call me?
[02:08:09.646 --> 02:08:10.887]  What'd my congressman call me?
[02:08:10.947 --> 02:08:12.047]  What'd my congressman call me?
[02:08:12.248 --> 02:08:13.348]  They all heard me.
[02:08:13.669 --> 02:08:15.870]  Not one of them turned around and faced the facts.
[02:08:16.291 --> 02:08:19.153]  And I want more volunteers and voters out here next time.
[02:08:19.353 --> 02:08:25.918]  Okay, I'm going to get Vicki Karp on, because we heard with the parallel voting that things didn't match what was announced, but...
[02:08:27.060 --> 02:08:32.689]  I can explain that Perry did lose in Travis, but he won in the rest of the state.
[02:08:33.410 --> 02:08:37.556]  And I have no doubt there's a bunch of idiots that would still vote for him even though he's still in the state and the country.
[02:08:38.540 --> 02:08:41.243]  But, sir, you need to remember the name of the precinct you were at.
[02:08:41.863 --> 02:08:50.751]  So, as a witness, it's more... 253 and 262, and anybody researching it should check into these Republicans I just mentioned who got victories.
[02:08:51.211 --> 02:08:53.293]  Okay, that's 252 and what?
[02:08:53.753 --> 02:08:55.695]  I'm sorry, 253 and 262.
[02:08:55.895 --> 02:08:57.476]  It's in North Austin.
[02:08:57.516 --> 02:09:00.258]  That was all at one station, one voting station.
[02:09:00.399 --> 02:09:00.819]  Say it again?
[02:09:00.839 --> 02:09:00.939]  253 and 262.
[02:09:05.615 --> 02:09:13.502]  Okay, and you said that Libertarians were getting a big percentage because they only got a few percentage points, and that doesn't make sense.
[02:09:13.542 --> 02:09:15.064]  Everybody I know says they're a Libertarian.
[02:09:15.244 --> 02:09:22.571]  Well, that was only in the case where a Republican only challenged a Libertarian, where a Democrat was not involved.
[02:09:23.011 --> 02:09:24.753]  The people were just anti-Republican.
[02:09:25.153 --> 02:09:28.236]  I mean, there were some votes for Republican, but it was like, you know, 10% to 90%.
[02:09:29.992 --> 02:09:31.013]  According to our polls.
[02:09:31.153 --> 02:09:38.939]  And there were some people saying, well, you know, Republicans aren't as willing to stop and fill out one of these unofficial ballots.
[02:09:39.219 --> 02:09:43.403]  I said, so you could still give them 20% for that margin, and they'd still win.
[02:09:43.783 --> 02:09:47.026]  But I don't understand how these Republicans, well, I do understand how they won.
[02:09:47.066 --> 02:09:47.686]  They cheated.
[02:09:48.207 --> 02:09:49.407]  Hart InterCivics?
[02:09:50.048 --> 02:09:51.369]  Man, they're a bunch of frauds.
[02:09:51.709 --> 02:09:57.214]  I hear you well, Michael McCall's father-in-law, Lowry Mays, the owner of Clear Channel, does own Hart InterCivics.
[02:09:58.166 --> 02:10:03.648]  Well, I can see how he got 57% after my data collected.
[02:10:03.668 --> 02:10:04.969]  He got not more than 20%.
[02:10:05.009 --> 02:10:10.451]  Well, when he got in two years ago, it showed that he was wildly unpopular, but he magically won by a huge majority.
[02:10:11.412 --> 02:10:18.675]  Yeah, and I just want people to remember what I said about after I turned and walked away, he called me some bad name.
[02:10:18.715 --> 02:10:19.976]  He didn't want to repeat it.
[02:10:20.336 --> 02:10:23.477]  That's how our conversation... Well, he was Janet Reno's... Thanks for the call.
[02:10:23.917 --> 02:10:25.218]  To show how Janet Reno...
[02:10:26.603 --> 02:10:31.287]  And the Republicans were together, and how the Democrats are together with the Republicans today, with Nancy Pelosi.
[02:10:31.607 --> 02:10:40.014]  Michael McCaul was the chief lawyer covering up Waco, basically running Senator Danforth when he was the head whitewasher.
[02:10:41.716 --> 02:10:46.119]  The Chinese spies in the White House, the missile secrets, the Ron Brown affair.
[02:10:46.219 --> 02:10:47.741]  I mean, that was Michael McCaul.
[02:10:47.761 --> 02:10:48.922]  I mean, that guy's scary, folks.
[02:10:48.942 --> 02:10:50.383]  He is a mafia don.
[02:10:51.681 --> 02:10:52.822]  I mean, that guy didn't play games.
[02:10:52.842 --> 02:10:55.124]  You've got a lot of nerve going over and saying stuff to him.
[02:10:55.144 --> 02:10:56.165]  These people are not playing.
[02:10:56.185 --> 02:10:58.406]  I mean, these are mafiosos.
[02:10:59.467 --> 02:11:02.349]  And they're cold-blooded killers.
[02:11:03.250 --> 02:11:06.633]  And they may not pull the trigger at Waco, but they're certainly involved.
[02:11:06.653 --> 02:11:11.216]  I mean, when you're Janet Reno's... Literally, he ran the Justice Department, basically.
[02:11:12.197 --> 02:11:12.557]  Okay?
[02:11:12.817 --> 02:11:15.139]  And again, he's a good Republican.
[02:11:15.560 --> 02:11:17.581]  Yeah, oh yeah, boy.
[02:11:18.122 --> 02:11:18.562]  You know what?
[02:11:18.622 --> 02:11:19.883]  It's all staged.
[02:11:21.824 --> 02:11:22.645]  It's staged.
[02:11:23.205 --> 02:11:24.106]  It's staged.
[02:11:24.546 --> 02:11:25.327]  It's staged.
[02:11:26.307 --> 02:11:27.769]  You look at all these big top Democrats.
[02:11:28.149 --> 02:11:34.173]  They've all been in the CIA or intelligence or with oil companies and in business with the Bushes and the Rockefellers and the Rothschilds.
[02:11:34.514 --> 02:11:36.895]  You look at the Republicans.
[02:11:36.915 --> 02:11:38.457]  They're all in business with the Democrats.
[02:11:39.037 --> 02:11:44.821]  It is a crew of criminals, and they knew there was a revolution, and I guess they just couldn't steal it nationwide.
[02:11:45.722 --> 02:11:48.364]  But we won't know because there's such a level of fraud.
[02:11:50.652 --> 02:12:00.237]  Alrighty, let's go ahead now and go to Sasha in Missouri.
[02:12:00.277 --> 02:12:01.178]  Sasha, you're on the air.
[02:12:01.238 --> 02:12:01.558]  Welcome.
[02:12:02.458 --> 02:12:03.319]  Howdy, Mr. Jones.
[02:12:03.639 --> 02:12:05.740]  I love the unrepresented Democrats out here.
[02:12:07.561 --> 02:12:09.142]  What do you think about Nancy Pelosi?
[02:12:10.022 --> 02:12:14.925]  Well, if she's going to be a blocker for this Bush run at fascism, then I just assume she stepped down now.
[02:12:16.835 --> 02:12:17.435]  Well, she is.
[02:12:17.515 --> 02:12:18.756]  She said she's going to be a blocker.
[02:12:19.016 --> 02:12:24.959]  Well, you know, and maybe I'm one of the coolest, maybe I'm one of the hopeful, and I'm hoping that that was a political ploy.
[02:12:25.180 --> 02:12:27.561]  I've sent her an email, I've sent my own congressman an email.
[02:12:27.581 --> 02:12:28.401]  It's not, brother.
[02:12:28.781 --> 02:12:32.443]  They're saying the exact same things in their press conferences.
[02:12:32.523 --> 02:12:33.304]  I've got a deal.
[02:12:37.373 --> 02:12:38.414]  Listen, listen.
[02:12:38.474 --> 02:12:40.735]  Day one, we need to call for her to step down.
[02:12:41.095 --> 02:12:48.219]  Day one, we need to call for a Democratic speaker who will have the hearings and go for impeachment and not whitewash things, okay?
[02:12:48.819 --> 02:12:52.361]  Now, if Democrats sit around and get fooled for a month or two, you're going to lose your momentum.
[02:12:52.461 --> 02:12:55.482]  Democrats better get it and better get it right now.
[02:12:55.863 --> 02:12:57.003]  Well, I'm not going to wait for a month.
[02:12:57.443 --> 02:12:58.084]  I've already mailed.
[02:12:58.444 --> 02:13:00.525]  I've been mailing for weeks demanding impeachment.
[02:13:00.925 --> 02:13:06.228]  I know that this Bush administration, this junta, has stolen elections, killed Americans, sprayed DU all over the Middle East,
[02:13:06.621 --> 02:13:16.772]  Disregarded nuclear non-proliferation treaties and global warming, lied to the American people ad infinitum, dissolved habeas corpus, the Bill of Rights, the Constitution, tortured American citizens and foreigners with impunity.
[02:13:17.032 --> 02:13:19.635]  There is no other reason in the world to impeach anybody.
[02:13:19.655 --> 02:13:21.697]  These guys need to go.
[02:13:21.717 --> 02:13:27.123]  And she needs to stand up for the American populace and for the people of this world because he's threatening them all.
[02:13:29.719 --> 02:13:36.106]  Well, a lot of times they engage in dog and pony smoking mirrors where they have Pelosi come out and attack him and he attack her back.
[02:13:36.507 --> 02:13:37.928]  They're not even doing that pretense.
[02:13:37.948 --> 02:13:39.630]  They're saying, we've made a deal.
[02:13:39.951 --> 02:13:40.992]  We're in partnership.
[02:13:42.094 --> 02:13:43.014]  We're working together.
[02:13:43.034 --> 02:13:47.516]  The Democrats are saying put more troops in Iraq when their constituents want us to leave.
[02:13:47.796 --> 02:13:49.097]  The Iraqis want us to leave.
[02:13:49.317 --> 02:13:51.958]  The military analysts say it would stabilize the situation.
[02:13:52.378 --> 02:13:53.338]  That's not going to happen.
[02:13:53.358 --> 02:13:57.320]  We're going to be there in 20 years until we break the left-right paradigm.
[02:13:57.840 --> 02:14:04.663]  And so Democrats out there just better demand that Nancy Pelosi now not be the Speaker.
[02:14:04.683 --> 02:14:06.704]  But notice the media acts like it's a foregone conclusion.
[02:14:06.744 --> 02:14:06.924]  No.
[02:14:07.324 --> 02:14:10.085]  When the Congress goes back into session next January...
[02:14:11.104 --> 02:14:11.984]  There will be a vote.
[02:14:12.945 --> 02:14:14.245]  Okay, it will be in committee.
[02:14:14.845 --> 02:14:16.646]  She needs to, it needs to be blocked.
[02:14:16.686 --> 02:14:18.047]  That movement needs to happen now.
[02:14:18.447 --> 02:14:25.690]  But you watch, your Air Americas and your nations and your counter punches and all of them, they're going to line up.
[02:14:26.170 --> 02:14:27.990]  This is how they manage us and control us.
[02:14:28.050 --> 02:14:29.051]  I appreciate your call.
[02:14:29.071 --> 02:14:34.433]  We're going to continue with your calls throughout this hour.
[02:14:35.916 --> 02:14:40.998]  The Democrats are saying they're not going to vote for the total amnesty plan known as guest worker program.
[02:14:42.198 --> 02:14:45.359]  Bush couldn't do that because there were some good Republicans in the House.
[02:14:45.479 --> 02:14:46.439]  Now the Democrats are there.
[02:14:46.479 --> 02:14:47.139]  Now they're going to do it.
[02:14:47.539 --> 02:14:48.720]  But they're already doing it.
[02:14:48.760 --> 02:14:53.681]  Wells Fargo already issues IDs that are accepted by 870 plus cities and counties.
[02:14:56.642 --> 02:14:59.023]  The White House is basically running Mexico City.
[02:15:00.203 --> 02:15:02.524]  It's just the North American Union is here.
[02:15:04.156 --> 02:15:05.396]  And this is serious.
[02:15:05.636 --> 02:15:06.637]  I mean, this is serious.
[02:15:08.117 --> 02:15:11.598]  And so we thought we'd get a separation of powers, but we're not.
[02:15:12.799 --> 02:15:21.201]  We have a shot, though, at really up front analyzing the dog and pony show and stopping it and trying to get real Democrats into leadership.
[02:15:21.741 --> 02:15:23.542]  Teamed up with folks like Ron Paul and others.
[02:15:23.582 --> 02:15:28.503]  There's a new consortium forming between Ron Paul and some freshman Democrats right now joining the Liberty Committee.
[02:15:28.523 --> 02:15:31.504]  We just got that in from Ron Paul's office talking to his chief of staff.
[02:15:32.822 --> 02:15:33.262]  We're good to go.
[02:15:56.986 --> 02:16:04.848]  PayPal blocked him just out of the blue, not even saying why, and just said, we're not going to let you use PayPal to sell your movie on your own website.
[02:16:04.908 --> 02:16:06.429]  We have thousands of them here.
[02:16:06.849 --> 02:16:07.529]  We're selling them.
[02:16:07.549 --> 02:16:13.450]  You can get them at Infowars.com and get Terror Storm with it for $9.95 when you do, if you wish to get my film with it.
[02:16:14.251 --> 02:16:15.671]  But Aaron Russo joins us.
[02:16:15.691 --> 02:16:16.731]  Aaron, thanks for coming on.
[02:16:17.151 --> 02:16:17.612]  Hey, Alex.
[02:16:17.672 --> 02:16:18.432]  Good to be here, buddy.
[02:16:18.612 --> 02:16:18.972]  How you doing?
[02:16:19.651 --> 02:16:26.557]  Well, I'm just watching the staged event as they put in the CFR Democrats to try to blunt any move to impeach Bush.
[02:16:27.177 --> 02:16:28.618]  Oh, there's no difference.
[02:16:28.638 --> 02:16:29.919]  It doesn't matter which party wins.
[02:16:30.100 --> 02:16:31.481]  You know what's going to happen now, Alex?
[02:16:32.101 --> 02:16:33.482]  You know what's going to happen.
[02:16:33.502 --> 02:16:35.364]  You're going to get the Democratic House.
[02:16:35.404 --> 02:16:37.506]  You're going to probably get a Democratic Senate.
[02:16:38.166 --> 02:16:41.529]  And then in 2008, you're going to get Hillary Clinton as the president.
[02:16:42.009 --> 02:16:43.571]  You have an old Democratic Party.
[02:16:43.591 --> 02:16:44.772]  And then you get the U.N.
[02:16:45.012 --> 02:16:46.493]  creating this one real government.
[02:16:47.099 --> 02:16:51.823]  You know, as opposed to Bush wanting America to run the world government, it's going to be the U.N.
[02:16:51.863 --> 02:16:52.544]  running the world government.
[02:16:52.564 --> 02:16:57.888]  And you know behind the scenes with Baker and the oil companies and Daddy Bush and David Rockefeller, you know this was all staged.
[02:16:57.908 --> 02:17:00.671]  I kept saying they're going to blame Bush for their whole agenda.
[02:17:00.691 --> 02:17:01.752]  They take a step forward.
[02:17:01.992 --> 02:17:03.053]  They blame the administration.
[02:17:03.073 --> 02:17:04.514]  They take another step forward with the next one.
[02:17:04.794 --> 02:17:08.097]  Blame that one, but always keep moving forward, and we're watching the feat.
[02:17:08.537 --> 02:17:09.298]  That's right.
[02:17:09.378 --> 02:17:13.962]  I'm telling you, this is all set up for Hillary Clinton to become the president in 2008.
[02:17:15.809 --> 02:17:18.510]  And to create a one-world government run by the U.N.
[02:17:18.590 --> 02:17:19.911]  That's what the Rockefellers want.
[02:17:20.491 --> 02:17:23.153]  And Bush wasn't for the U.N.
[02:17:23.193 --> 02:17:25.053]  as much as the Rockefellers are, you know?
[02:17:25.654 --> 02:17:26.634]  And that's the deal.
[02:17:26.654 --> 02:17:27.795]  That's what's happening here.
[02:17:27.915 --> 02:17:33.257]  And you've seen the whole thing being swept right into existence.
[02:17:33.417 --> 02:17:34.578]  And you know what's going to happen now?
[02:17:34.598 --> 02:17:35.018]  Stay there, Aaron.
[02:17:35.038 --> 02:17:35.838]  We're going to be right back.
[02:17:35.859 --> 02:17:37.199]  Tell us what's going to happen when we get back.
[02:17:37.859 --> 02:17:39.260]  Stay with us, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:17:39.700 --> 02:17:41.701]  Continual coverage of the 2006 staged elections.
[02:17:45.549 --> 02:17:46.611]  Ted Anderson from Midas.
[02:17:46.651 --> 02:17:47.432]  Today is November 8th, 2006.
[02:17:47.512 --> 02:17:51.217]  Gold opened at $6.23 and one ounce gold coins can be purchased for $6.49.74 and $3.25.38 for half ounce coins.
[02:17:51.257 --> 02:17:51.697]  That's $6.49.74 and $3.25.38.
[02:18:00.769 --> 02:18:13.478]  On June 4th, 1963, an unknown presidential decree, Executive Order 11110, was signed with the authority to strip the Federal Reserve Bank of its power to lend money to the United States government and interest.
[02:18:13.939 --> 02:18:17.061]  With the stroke of a pen, Kennedy would have put the Fed out of business.
[02:18:17.581 --> 02:18:20.523]  If you're interested in breaking the bondage of taxation and debt, call 800-686-2237.
[02:18:20.563 --> 02:18:21.023]  That's 800-686-2237.
[02:18:47.046 --> 02:18:49.428]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:18:49.909 --> 02:18:56.555]  Did you know that an FBI agent assigned to the White House when Bill Clinton took office wrote a book entitled Unlimited Access?
[02:18:57.401 --> 02:19:04.368]  He told of Clinton's staff coming into the White House its first day with red buttons on their shirt with a picture of the first communist dictator, V.I.
[02:19:04.848 --> 02:19:05.509]  Lenin, on them.
[02:19:06.369 --> 02:19:11.054]  Is it any wonder the United States government moved further to the left during the Clinton administration?
[02:19:11.654 --> 02:19:15.658]  Even Hillary tried to pass a socialistic program for health care.
[02:19:16.279 --> 02:19:23.786]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch magazine.

[02:19:47.495 --> 02:19:48.555]  The war on terrorism.
[02:19:48.856 --> 02:19:51.637]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[02:19:51.917 --> 02:19:56.078]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[02:19:56.498 --> 02:19:57.339]  So what do you do?
[02:19:57.639 --> 02:20:02.240]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[02:20:02.701 --> 02:20:04.821]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[02:20:05.322 --> 02:20:06.182]  Sheltering in place.
[02:20:06.604 --> 02:20:07.545]  We're good to go.
[02:20:32.065 --> 02:20:33.568]  Or order on the web at BerkeyWater.com.
[02:20:45.515 --> 02:20:50.297]  Times are tough right now, but there are a lot of different ways to get ourselves out of this mess.
[02:20:50.518 --> 02:20:54.500]  Providing for our own food, water, and power are a good start.
[02:20:54.760 --> 02:21:01.043]  As you may have heard by now, Ken Solar has been configuring alternative energy packages for over a decade.

[02:21:48.066 --> 02:21:50.046]  Come, you masters of war.
[02:21:52.467 --> 02:21:54.448]  Here they build the big guns.
[02:21:56.828 --> 02:21:59.209]  Here they build the death planes.
[02:22:01.149 --> 02:22:03.030]  Here they build all the bombs.
[02:22:05.487 --> 02:22:06.368]  Welcome back.
[02:22:06.628 --> 02:22:11.710]  Aaron Russo is our guest.
[02:22:13.091 --> 02:22:17.073]  We're going to have open phones in the next segment.
[02:22:17.093 --> 02:22:17.213]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:22:17.353 --> 02:22:19.715]  I'm asking Democrats...
[02:22:29.969 --> 02:22:31.370]  Do you see through the fraud?
[02:22:31.390 --> 02:22:32.630]  Do you see through the leadership?
[02:22:32.650 --> 02:22:33.831]  Do you see what they're doing?
[02:22:34.371 --> 02:22:35.291]  How they play us?
[02:22:35.431 --> 02:22:37.032]  Will we wake up to this and have freedom?
[02:22:37.752 --> 02:22:38.693]  The war continues.
[02:22:38.713 --> 02:22:40.053]  We're talking about expanding troops.
[02:22:41.474 --> 02:22:45.116]  They're talking about leaving the Patriot Act in, the Military Commissions Act, all of it.
[02:22:45.756 --> 02:22:50.178]  Aaron, the whole agenda just continues, and they're just using the Democrats as a steam valve.
[02:22:51.418 --> 02:22:52.459]  It's never going to change.
[02:22:52.479 --> 02:22:54.400]  That's not what it's about.
[02:22:55.020 --> 02:22:59.482]  I mean, the differences between the Democrats and the Republicans are insignificant.
[02:23:00.239 --> 02:23:04.582]  You know, they'll talk about the environmental difference, or this difference, gun control.
[02:23:04.682 --> 02:23:06.103]  They'll make up these little stories.
[02:23:06.663 --> 02:23:16.289]  But the main thrust, where America's heading, the one world government, the North American Union, all these things are never going to change, whether it's Democrats or Republicans that are in office.
[02:23:16.910 --> 02:23:18.511]  That's the problem we face in this country.
[02:23:18.531 --> 02:23:19.291]  Well, I agree with you.
[02:23:19.311 --> 02:23:23.274]  Right now, that Hillary Clinton will be the one running for president in 2008.
[02:23:23.914 --> 02:23:26.416]  They'll do everything in their power to push you into business.
[02:23:27.057 --> 02:23:34.402]  And that the Democrats will control the House, the Senate, the Presidency, and the U.N., and they'll create a one-world government run by the U.N.
[02:23:34.442 --> 02:23:35.022]  And that's why...
[02:23:36.880 --> 02:23:44.365]  Rupert Murdoch, who conservatives love, is financing her, dining her every week, vacationing with her.
[02:23:44.485 --> 02:23:46.227]  Roger Ailes, the guy behind Limbaugh.
[02:23:46.607 --> 02:23:54.292]  It's all totally staged, and they're laughing all the way to the bank as we go on our way to the FEMA camp.
[02:23:54.933 --> 02:23:57.094]  But later we're going to talk about Wesley Snipes.
[02:23:57.114 --> 02:23:59.276]  You heard from him last night.
[02:24:00.356 --> 02:24:02.677]  The New York Times reporting there is no deal.
[02:24:02.697 --> 02:24:06.117]  They want to arrest him because he found out that the tax system is a fraud.
[02:24:06.157 --> 02:24:12.719]  And this ties in to the entire system and the Federal Reserve and who really runs this country.
[02:24:13.499 --> 02:24:14.699]  There's no question about it.
[02:24:15.619 --> 02:24:27.502]  And the fact is that until... In my view, Alex, this is our... Between now and 2008 is our last chance to put somebody into office that can make a change in this country.
[02:24:27.882 --> 02:24:27.982]  And...
[02:24:28.846 --> 02:24:51.942]  It's my suggestion and my belief that the freedom movement better galvanize together and run two people from a president and vice president and make some decisions very soon about who they're going to run and stop all this third party stuff and get two people who believe in the freedom movement from the bottom of their hearts and start a movement across this country so that Hillary Clinton can't become the president in 2008.
[02:24:52.142 --> 02:24:52.963]  You know what's incredible?
[02:24:53.003 --> 02:24:54.484]  I talk to people in Hollywood all the time.
[02:24:54.504 --> 02:24:55.565]  You talk to more of them than I do.
[02:24:57.034 --> 02:24:58.855]  And they all know about the New World Order.
[02:24:58.875 --> 02:25:00.156]  They all know about vaccines.
[02:25:00.176 --> 02:25:01.397]  They all know about the Federal Reserve.
[02:25:01.417 --> 02:25:08.040]  I mean, who knew that you've known for a long time, he's come over to your office, that Wesley Snipes is a big patriot and knows about the New World Order.
[02:25:08.320 --> 02:25:14.864]  And I've been at meetings in Hollywood with people bigger than the great guy Charlie Sheen, and they all know the truth.
[02:25:16.345 --> 02:25:17.546]  But they won't go public.
[02:25:18.686 --> 02:25:19.547]  Because they're afraid.
[02:25:19.587 --> 02:25:20.948]  They're afraid of losing their positions.
[02:25:20.968 --> 02:25:22.168]  They're afraid of losing their jobs.
[02:25:22.628 --> 02:25:25.190]  It takes a certain courage of character to step out.
[02:25:25.700 --> 02:25:26.481]  I'm telling you something.
[02:25:26.522 --> 02:25:28.164]  We better start a movement right now.
[02:25:39.539 --> 02:25:43.300]  We're going to have you on more in the near future for several hours.
[02:25:43.681 --> 02:25:44.421]  You've got a plan.
[02:25:44.461 --> 02:25:45.281]  I think it's a great plan.
[02:25:45.301 --> 02:25:46.742]  I'm getting behind your plan.
[02:25:46.782 --> 02:25:50.063]  I'm with you, Aaron Russo, to take this on.
[02:25:50.083 --> 02:25:52.243]  But let's talk about right now America's Freedom from Fascism.
[02:25:53.544 --> 02:25:59.726]  I am very excited to tell you that they're going out the door like hotcakes here at Infowars.com on our secure video and bookstore online.
[02:26:00.386 --> 02:26:02.487]  Well, the PayPal situation is resolving itself because
[02:26:29.491 --> 02:26:30.392]  I got on the phone with them.
[02:26:30.452 --> 02:26:32.774]  They shut me down yesterday for no reason at all.
[02:26:32.854 --> 02:26:33.634]  No apparent reason.
[02:26:33.674 --> 02:26:34.715]  I spoke to them on the phone.
[02:26:34.755 --> 02:26:39.719]  First they gave me some secretary or something who couldn't answer any questions.
[02:26:39.739 --> 02:26:43.121]  Then they finally sent me upstairs because I refused to get off the phone.
[02:26:44.042 --> 02:26:46.604]  And I spoke to somebody else up there, a fellow named Dustin.
[02:26:47.384 --> 02:26:51.307]  And speaking to him, I let him know exactly what was happening here.
[02:26:51.327 --> 02:26:56.711]  And I told him that if this wasn't back up today, that my lawyer, I was going to shoot him.
[02:26:56.731 --> 02:26:58.733]  They couldn't give me any valid reason
[02:26:59.301 --> 02:27:00.181]  We're shutting it down.
[02:27:00.362 --> 02:27:01.702]  There was no reason, and he knew it.
[02:27:02.362 --> 02:27:03.643]  And he knew there was no reason.
[02:27:04.123 --> 02:27:08.065]  And it's my understanding that we're going back up in the next couple of minutes, if we're not up yet.
[02:27:08.485 --> 02:27:09.306]  All right, good.
[02:27:09.546 --> 02:27:10.546]  But again, this shows.
[02:27:10.586 --> 02:27:11.247]  They're working.
[02:27:11.287 --> 02:27:13.408]  They've got teams working against us everywhere.
[02:27:13.428 --> 02:27:16.669]  There's been all sorts of tricks played on us.

[02:27:35.794 --> 02:27:36.695]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.195 --> 02:27:38.776]  The Empire's on the run.

[02:30:52.721 --> 02:30:55.543]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:56.924 --> 02:31:01.247]  We're going to be blitzing through your phone calls here in just a few minutes at 1-800-259-9231.
[02:31:01.868 --> 02:31:06.151]  Aaron Russo, director and producer of American Freedom of Fascism.
[02:31:06.551 --> 02:31:08.873]  Incredible film that we carry at Infowars.com.
[02:31:09.293 --> 02:31:10.154]  He is with us.
[02:31:10.514 --> 02:31:13.196]  I wanted to get into Wesley Snipes, though, because he's friends with Wesley.
[02:31:13.216 --> 02:31:14.197]  He just talked to Wesley.
[02:31:15.447 --> 02:31:15.927]  We're good to go.
[02:31:36.085 --> 02:31:38.187]  And privately tell me about the conversation.
[02:31:38.207 --> 02:31:47.974]  I don't know how much of it we can get into on air, but Wesley Snipes, who often portrays law enforcement agents in movies, remains a federal fugitive, and no deal has been made to drop the tax fraud conspiracy charges against him.
[02:31:48.335 --> 02:31:56.261]  A spokesman for Paul I. Perez, the United States Attorney in Central Florida, said yesterday Mr. Snipes, 44, was charged in an indictment handed up last month.
[02:31:57.041 --> 02:32:07.112]  He is in Nambia filming Gallo Walker, a horror movie for Hannibal Pictures and the Double Edge Entertainment, two independent filmmakers in Southern California.
[02:32:07.936 --> 02:32:11.377]  And it goes on to say the United States does not have an extradition treaty with Nambia.
[02:32:11.837 --> 02:32:16.137]  The country's laws, however, allow foreign governments to apply to have criminals, suspects extradited.
[02:32:16.157 --> 02:32:21.778]  The State Department said the government is negotiating with Mr. Snipes, said Steve Cole, the spokesman for Mr. Perez.
[02:32:22.098 --> 02:32:31.140]  Variety, the Hollywood trade publication, reported last Thursday that Mr. Snipes will not be jailed and will be allowed both to continue working and to travel abroad.
[02:32:31.620 --> 02:32:35.001]  But Variety is now saying that that was incorrect information and the U.S.
[02:32:35.041 --> 02:32:36.281]  attorneys and others are saying it's not.
[02:32:37.921 --> 02:32:38.822]  You know Wesley Snipes.
[02:32:38.842 --> 02:32:39.422]  You've talked to him.
[02:32:39.662 --> 02:32:48.524]  What's really going on with this tax case, and then why did Wesley decide to stop paying into the private Federal Reserve cartel, Aaron Ruscha?
[02:32:49.484 --> 02:32:51.004]  Well, you know, I know Wesley.
[02:32:51.184 --> 02:32:54.705]  I've been communicating with him through email, not through phone.
[02:32:56.165 --> 02:32:59.006]  But you said he's come to your office and seen America, Freedom to Fascism.
[02:32:59.026 --> 02:32:59.666]  Yes, he has.
[02:32:59.866 --> 02:33:00.466]  Yes, he has.
[02:33:01.046 --> 02:33:02.567]  And he's very familiar with the movie.
[02:33:02.587 --> 02:33:03.347]  He's seen the movie.
[02:33:04.370 --> 02:33:06.872]  I respected the movie very much.
[02:33:06.892 --> 02:33:08.653]  I thought it was brilliant.
[02:33:09.474 --> 02:33:11.875]  Tom had told me that everybody in the world should see the movie.
[02:33:11.935 --> 02:33:13.416]  You know, Nick Nolte saw the movie.
[02:33:13.436 --> 02:33:15.818]  He thought everybody should get all that information out there.
[02:33:15.838 --> 02:33:18.340]  Many people know what's going on in this country.
[02:33:18.380 --> 02:33:20.481]  It's very difficult for many people to speak up.
[02:33:21.462 --> 02:33:26.205]  And, you know, I thought that I had read that Wesley had settled.
[02:33:27.266 --> 02:33:32.790]  And I gathered from my latest email that I received that he has not settled.
[02:33:33.684 --> 02:33:37.685]  And that the next phase is coming up, whatever's in his mind.
[02:33:38.005 --> 02:33:46.047]  I don't know exactly what's on his mind, but just that the next phase is coming and that things are going to get bigger.
[02:33:46.507 --> 02:33:59.490]  And what I can tell, Wesley's very, very, very smart about the income tax laws, knows what's going on, knows about the Federal Reserve System, and doesn't want to put up with the fraud that's happening in this country.
[02:34:00.214 --> 02:34:04.920]  Now, you talked to him without giving away too much about going public and fighting back and telling his side.
[02:34:04.940 --> 02:34:12.669]  And do you want to... Well, I don't want to say too much of what he said, but there's a good chance... I've only communicated through email.
[02:34:12.689 --> 02:34:13.650]  I've not spoken to him.
[02:34:13.790 --> 02:34:16.674]  No, no, you read me that during a break, and it was... It was email, yes.
[02:34:17.688 --> 02:34:22.249]  I mean, I hope he's going to be going public to defend himself.
[02:34:22.349 --> 02:34:24.030]  You heard the email that I read to you.
[02:34:24.550 --> 02:34:25.931]  My sense of it is that he will.
[02:34:26.251 --> 02:34:26.851]  Yeah.
[02:34:27.191 --> 02:34:34.953]  As I read that email, as I read it to you, I gather that he will be, and that phase two is coming up, whatever that may be.
[02:34:35.073 --> 02:34:37.014]  My sense is he's getting his ducks in a row.
[02:34:37.034 --> 02:34:39.375]  Well, I hope he'll do it on this broadcast, Aaron.
[02:34:40.035 --> 02:34:43.316]  Well, you know, I would encourage him to talk to you on this broadcast, and...
[02:34:44.378 --> 02:34:51.166]  I think Wesley has a lot to say, and I think he can bring a lot of... What's the word I'm looking for?
[02:34:51.186 --> 02:34:56.452]  A lot of illumination to this problem we're dealing with in this country.
[02:34:56.492 --> 02:34:57.834]  I think Wesley's case...
[02:34:58.556 --> 02:35:01.618]  Can bring a lot of illumination, a lot of light to the situation.
[02:35:01.678 --> 02:35:13.146]  Now, I want to get back into the election, but the reason we've got you on today, Aaron, is because you've been being persecuted through PayPal, and your film really goes to the heart, the root of the problem, the private run-for-profit Federal Reserve System.
[02:35:13.166 --> 02:35:14.627]  We have new listeners every millisecond.
[02:35:15.067 --> 02:35:22.132]  In a nutshell, tell folks what the Federal Reserve System is and why Wesley Snipes and many others have looked at it and decided not to pay into it.
[02:35:23.212 --> 02:35:26.995]  Well, Lewis, the Federal Reserve System is a private banking cartel
[02:35:27.918 --> 02:35:41.545]  That pushed the income tax to labor on people's taxes, that when the government needs money today, they borrow from the Federal Reserve System, and they use your taxes to pay the interest of the Federal Reserve System.
[02:35:41.905 --> 02:35:44.786]  If the government made the money, here's the thing that people have to recognize.
[02:35:45.366 --> 02:35:47.447]  Our government is so massively in debt.
[02:35:47.928 --> 02:35:48.888]  Why are they in debt?
[02:35:49.188 --> 02:35:52.590]  When the government has the ability to make the money without borrowing it.
[02:35:53.197 --> 02:35:55.399]  Our government doesn't have to borrow money.
[02:35:55.419 --> 02:36:02.104]  It's been designed where when money is created, immediate debt is paid into private interest.
[02:36:02.144 --> 02:36:03.305]  It's a total fraud.
[02:36:03.705 --> 02:36:04.306]  Exactly.
[02:36:04.626 --> 02:36:05.627]  And that's the point.
[02:36:05.647 --> 02:36:06.667]  But people understand.
[02:36:07.048 --> 02:36:08.108]  People don't think about it.
[02:36:08.489 --> 02:36:10.590]  But they understand the paradigm, the concept.
[02:36:10.991 --> 02:36:15.694]  Well, our government has the legal authority to make the money, particularly if it's backed by the gold.
[02:36:16.255 --> 02:36:21.899]  So why are they borrowing money and running all this debt up and then taxing us to pay the interest on the debt?
[02:36:22.549 --> 02:36:23.529]  It's a fraud.
[02:36:23.830 --> 02:36:24.870]  The whole thing is a fraud.
[02:36:25.090 --> 02:36:28.611]  There's no need for the American government to be borrowing all these billions of dollars.
[02:36:28.851 --> 02:36:30.112]  It's unnecessary.
[02:36:30.452 --> 02:36:40.056]  If folks will take action, and if they'll get America freedom to fascism, and if they'll give it to everybody they know, because we've been talking about this for decades, now the people are ready to hear it.
[02:36:40.636 --> 02:36:41.957]  Now the buzz is there.
[02:36:41.977 --> 02:36:43.737]  Now is the time to take action.
[02:36:43.777 --> 02:36:48.099]  Folks, please get America freedom to fascism at Infowars.com or by calling toll-free.
[02:36:48.797 --> 02:36:48.917]  1-888-253-3139.
[02:36:48.937 --> 02:36:49.898]  Don't procrastinate.
[02:36:50.038 --> 02:36:53.561]  If you've already gotten one copy, get another copy.
[02:36:53.581 --> 02:36:53.982]  Get ten copies.
[02:36:54.002 --> 02:36:54.362]  888-253-3139 or Infowars.com.
[02:37:04.839 --> 02:37:05.359]  Alex, how are you?
[02:37:30.000 --> 02:37:37.966]  Well, last night I was watching the election results, and they had a good 20 minutes on talking about Hillary Clinton and how she pulled away from everybody.
[02:37:38.387 --> 02:37:43.391]  So I'm thinking, a couple years ago when she first came to New York, there was a lot of talk that people didn't want her here.
[02:37:43.811 --> 02:37:48.635]  So I'm thinking there was voter fraud back then just to get her in, get her popularity up.
[02:37:49.035 --> 02:37:57.862]  The guy talking last night on TV was saying if she gets 70%, that's a good nod for her to go ahead and run for the president in 2008.
[02:37:59.144 --> 02:38:04.288]  So I don't know what the final results were, what the percentage was, but they're already lining her up for 2008.
[02:38:04.328 --> 02:38:05.609]  It's just, it's in the books.
[02:38:06.270 --> 02:38:06.590]  I hear you.
[02:38:06.610 --> 02:38:07.511]  Are you on a speakerphone?
[02:38:09.752 --> 02:38:11.013]  Can you hear me?
[02:38:11.273 --> 02:38:12.374]  Yeah, I really couldn't hear much.
[02:38:12.394 --> 02:38:15.317]  Yeah, speakerphones are a big no-no on talk radio.
[02:38:15.877 --> 02:38:16.898]  And it's not that I'm mad at you.
[02:38:16.918 --> 02:38:18.239]  I want to be able to hear what you have to say.
[02:38:18.259 --> 02:38:19.180]  No, it was a headset.
[02:38:19.240 --> 02:38:20.300]  It was a headset I was on.
[02:38:20.481 --> 02:38:20.841]  Oh, okay.
[02:38:21.523 --> 02:38:22.984]  You sound like you were in a barrel.
[02:38:23.985 --> 02:38:32.872]  No, I mean, certainly, look, when Rupert Murdoch starts campaigning for her, when he starts giving her money, and when Rush Limbaugh says she's the best candidate, he did that.
[02:38:32.912 --> 02:38:40.678]  I mean, you know, now I'm a liberal with the Republicans because I'm against Hillary, and then I'm a fascist with the Democrats because I'm against Nancy Pelosi.
[02:38:41.099 --> 02:38:45.342]  I mean, it's just, Americans, you need to stop being so stupid and get more sophisticated.
[02:38:45.382 --> 02:38:45.962]  Aaron Russo?
[02:38:47.283 --> 02:38:49.345]  Stop being so stupid?
[02:38:49.365 --> 02:38:50.486]  That's a tall order, Alex.
[02:38:51.091 --> 02:38:53.033]  You know, people have to have critical thinking.
[02:38:53.073 --> 02:38:54.234]  They don't think anymore.
[02:38:54.254 --> 02:38:54.994]  They're just taught.
[02:38:55.295 --> 02:38:56.516]  They're told what to think.
[02:38:56.936 --> 02:38:58.817]  And we've got to break away from that paradigm.
[02:38:58.857 --> 02:39:01.480]  People have to wake up and start thinking for themselves.
[02:39:01.760 --> 02:39:07.845]  There's no question that Hillary Clinton is going to be the Democratic nominee, not Obama.
[02:39:08.205 --> 02:39:10.987]  You know, in 2008, they're going to have Hillary.
[02:39:11.007 --> 02:39:13.830]  They're going to have Nancy Pelosi.
[02:39:13.850 --> 02:39:15.611]  They're creating this one world government.
[02:39:15.979 --> 02:39:16.880]  Run through the UN.
[02:39:16.900 --> 02:39:18.703]  The Rockefellers own Hillary Clinton.
[02:39:19.023 --> 02:39:20.044]  They own Bill Clinton.
[02:39:20.084 --> 02:39:25.071]  And then if you're against the Hillarys and Pelosi's, you must hate women.
[02:39:25.711 --> 02:39:29.616]  And the women will all go vote out like it's some suffrage or something.
[02:39:29.997 --> 02:39:34.723]  No, but the point is, you know, we can sit and talk about this all day, but the real point is, what are we going to do to stop it?
[02:39:35.874 --> 02:39:38.415]  Aaron, let me do this.
[02:39:38.435 --> 02:39:46.660]  Let me set you up for two hours if you've got time next week, and we'll talk about your plan because we can't do it justice here in five minutes.
[02:39:46.700 --> 02:39:50.702]  In fact, I'm going to have Kevin set you up for two hours next Thursday or Friday.
[02:39:51.002 --> 02:39:51.723]  Thank you, Joe.
[02:39:52.023 --> 02:39:53.904]  Let's talk to Russell in Florida.
[02:39:53.944 --> 02:39:54.504]  Go ahead, Russell.
[02:39:55.505 --> 02:39:56.685]  Alex, what was the quote?
[02:39:57.206 --> 02:40:05.110]  I think it was by a globalist that said that we'll throw the dastardly rascals out and we'll replace them with our other guys.
[02:40:05.891 --> 02:40:09.414]  I can't think of the quote, but that's what this election looks like to me.
[02:40:09.434 --> 02:40:23.646]  And I can't help, and I'm sure you both agree, but to think that these Democrats that are getting in are just now going to implement amnesty, keep our borders open, probably agree with Bush and go along with the North American Union.
[02:40:23.666 --> 02:40:25.428]  And then it'll be the liberals' fault.
[02:40:25.488 --> 02:40:26.289]  Yes.
[02:40:26.329 --> 02:40:28.651]  See, the Republicans move forward, then it's their fault.
[02:40:28.811 --> 02:40:30.813]  And the Democrats take another step, and then it's their fault.
[02:40:30.833 --> 02:40:31.994]  That's how they do it.
[02:40:32.534 --> 02:40:33.595]  Well, the Republicans...
[02:40:34.344 --> 02:40:43.226]  By putting a fake conservative Christian like Bush in, they put the fake conservative Christians to sleep so they won't fight the implementation of North America.
[02:40:43.266 --> 02:40:46.547]  Sure, they can be led by their methamphetamine gay leaders.
[02:40:46.687 --> 02:40:53.008]  Yes, and then the Democrats come in and implement all this and put it forward so the Republicans don't get blamed.
[02:40:53.348 --> 02:40:55.208]  And we just have the same thing going on and on.
[02:40:55.248 --> 02:41:02.810]  And I would love to listen to Aaron's ideas of how to stop this because we're marching toward a one-world government.
[02:41:03.223 --> 02:41:03.483]  Absolutely.
[02:41:03.503 --> 02:41:04.483]  Thank you for the call.
[02:41:04.503 --> 02:41:04.743]  Thank you.
[02:41:30.698 --> 02:41:31.858]  I did not know that.
[02:41:31.999 --> 02:41:34.060]  And now it's the Democrats are running things.
[02:41:34.100 --> 02:41:35.161]  They want to increase the troops.
[02:41:35.281 --> 02:41:37.182]  That's okay because they're our guys.
[02:41:37.202 --> 02:41:37.823]  They're Democrats.
[02:41:38.804 --> 02:41:41.185]  And Pelosi said no impeachment hearings, no nothing.
[02:41:41.486 --> 02:41:42.827]  Chris in Kentucky, you're on the air.
[02:41:42.887 --> 02:41:43.327]  Go ahead.
[02:41:45.629 --> 02:41:47.690]  This election was the most staged I've ever seen.
[02:41:47.730 --> 02:41:55.176]  But, you know, the thing is that that's the people, some protesters that are just so fed up with the two-party system of no left and right.
[02:41:55.276 --> 02:41:58.959]  I saw new American-centric protest signs and I went up to some of these protesters and asked,
[02:41:59.554 --> 02:42:01.055]  Do you listen to the Alex Jones Show?
[02:42:01.275 --> 02:42:03.856]  But they had no idea who you were, and I told them who you were.
[02:42:03.876 --> 02:42:05.677]  There are people out here waking up.
[02:42:05.897 --> 02:42:06.638]  They're fed up.
[02:42:06.978 --> 02:42:07.758]  Oh, that's the good news.
[02:42:07.798 --> 02:42:09.379]  They're saying the exact same things we're saying.
[02:42:09.399 --> 02:42:10.039]  Never heard of us.
[02:42:10.279 --> 02:42:10.960]  Never heard of you.
[02:42:11.000 --> 02:42:19.504]  And I've met three gentlemen that were in that protest, but I did give your website out, and they said it's refreshing to know that we've got somebody in radio that knows the truth.
[02:42:20.425 --> 02:42:21.466]  They were very happy.
[02:42:21.666 --> 02:42:23.167]  Let me just make a point here.
[02:42:23.208 --> 02:42:23.708]  This is key.
[02:42:24.188 --> 02:42:26.130]  The majority know the truth.
[02:42:26.150 --> 02:42:28.473]  84% believe 9-11 is a lie.
[02:42:28.493 --> 02:42:31.316]  84% disapprove of both political parties and major scientific polls.
[02:42:31.336 --> 02:42:37.582]  90-plus percent, most polls show 90, some 91 in a Gallup poll, are against the open borders.
[02:42:38.806 --> 02:42:44.550]  99% are against the Kelo, New London, Connecticut decision on private property being grabbed by private interest.
[02:42:44.570 --> 02:42:47.452]  90-plus percent are against all the things.
[02:42:48.013 --> 02:42:50.654]  97% against the NAFTA, trans-NAFTA highway corridors.
[02:42:51.055 --> 02:42:54.497]  But again, the Republicans and Democrats are together against us.
[02:42:54.777 --> 02:42:56.718]  It's totally obvious, Aaron Russo.
[02:42:56.738 --> 02:42:59.020]  There's no question about that.
[02:42:59.420 --> 02:43:07.886]  One of the things that I found amazing last night was not just the Democrat and Republican, but in South Dakota, the jail for judges, how that turned around.
[02:43:08.675 --> 02:43:12.237]  I'd like to do some investigation up there because... Oh, I didn't know.
[02:43:12.257 --> 02:43:29.566]  Now, there was that prop to create a state... Prop A. Yes, a proposition to have oversight of the judges by a state grand jury funded off the judges' salaries, I think at 1.8%, and that thing was showing in polls it was going to win by 10 to 15 points.
[02:43:29.906 --> 02:43:30.786]  I forgot about that.
[02:43:30.826 --> 02:43:31.647]  Let me guess.
[02:43:31.747 --> 02:43:32.227]  It failed.
[02:43:32.247 --> 02:43:35.589]  It failed, but not only did it fail, it failed 10 to 1.
[02:43:37.119 --> 02:43:43.386]  Okay, even the local television station up there ran polls, scientific polls, showing it winning by 10 or 15 points.
[02:43:45.970 --> 02:43:47.351]  Then this morning it fell about 90%.
[02:43:48.052 --> 02:43:50.153]  What was that prop number?
[02:43:50.514 --> 02:43:51.895]  Prop E. Yeah, that's right.
[02:43:51.915 --> 02:43:53.536]  Prop E. I've got to do an article on that.
[02:43:53.596 --> 02:43:53.956]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:43:54.176 --> 02:43:59.020]  I saw the scientific polls in the last few weeks winning by 10 to 15 points.
[02:43:59.220 --> 02:44:00.962]  Wildly popular.
[02:44:01.402 --> 02:44:04.464]  And then you're telling me that it was almost 10 to 1 loss.
[02:44:05.105 --> 02:44:07.787]  Yeah, 89% to 11% against it.
[02:44:08.207 --> 02:44:11.490]  So I was talking on the phone with some of my people this morning.
[02:44:12.153 --> 02:44:16.456]  By getting a bunch of people up there with video cameras and asking people how they voted.
[02:44:17.417 --> 02:44:18.618]  Well, that's what needs to be done.
[02:44:18.638 --> 02:44:26.324]  And folks, you're seeing it happen right here with Prop E that had some oversight of the judges who say, I don't allow the law in my courtroom.
[02:44:26.344 --> 02:44:27.725]  I don't allow the Constitution in my courtroom.
[02:44:27.965 --> 02:44:29.006]  They're all starting to say it.
[02:44:29.026 --> 02:44:29.907]  They think they're God.
[02:44:30.287 --> 02:44:31.208]  This is the tyranny.
[02:44:32.043 --> 02:44:34.784]  And so it's wildly popular to hold judges accountable.
[02:44:34.844 --> 02:44:36.244]  The polls all show it was going to win.
[02:44:36.324 --> 02:44:37.124]  And what happens?
[02:44:37.765 --> 02:44:42.226]  See, the electronic voting machine scam is to keep third parties and initiatives out.
[02:44:42.846 --> 02:44:43.146]  Okay?
[02:44:43.186 --> 02:44:46.987]  It's to keep stuff out, you know, that would not give welfare to illegal aliens.
[02:44:47.307 --> 02:44:49.088]  It's to keep stuff out that people want.
[02:44:49.188 --> 02:44:49.448]  Aaron?
[02:44:51.148 --> 02:44:55.249]  I mean, it's hard to repeat what you're saying, Alex, but you're saying exactly right.
[02:44:55.630 --> 02:44:56.410]  This is the problem.
[02:44:56.710 --> 02:44:58.570]  And I keep saying we have to find the solutions.
[02:44:58.650 --> 02:45:00.611]  You know, we can sit and talk about the problems.
[02:45:01.115 --> 02:45:03.437]  I think everybody listening to your show knows the problems.
[02:45:03.817 --> 02:45:04.918]  What are we going to do to fix it?
[02:45:05.759 --> 02:45:08.221]  Well, next week we're going to do a two-hour show on that.
[02:45:08.421 --> 02:45:11.704]  And we talk about solutions all the time, but the solution still is get the word out.
[02:45:11.944 --> 02:45:19.090]  You and I, most of our listeners may know everything, or a lot of things, but the general public still just doesn't get how bad it is.
[02:45:19.310 --> 02:45:25.696]  Yeah, one of the things I would love people to do listening to this show is go on Alex's website, buy my video.
[02:45:26.286 --> 02:45:27.246]  Spread them out, Dick.
[02:45:27.507 --> 02:45:28.707]  Pass them out to everybody.
[02:45:28.727 --> 02:45:31.068]  Pass the DVDs around like crazy.
[02:45:31.248 --> 02:45:31.688]  Exactly.
[02:45:31.708 --> 02:45:36.290]  Wake up America, because 2008 is, in my opinion, the last shot we got.
[02:45:37.190 --> 02:45:38.691]  Wake up America, folks.
[02:45:38.771 --> 02:45:40.372]  Please, buy the DVD from Alex.
[02:45:40.812 --> 02:45:43.893]  Get out there and start spreading the word on this.
[02:45:44.273 --> 02:45:51.356]  And let me add a caveat, and then we'll go back to your calls, and I appreciate your call, caller Chris in Kentucky, and we'll go to Dee and others in a moment.
[02:45:52.705 --> 02:45:53.265]  We're good to go.
[02:45:53.285 --> 02:45:53.946]  We're good to go.
[02:46:22.242 --> 02:46:23.463]  I mean, now is the time.
[02:46:23.503 --> 02:46:25.785]  Go to InfoWars.com.
[02:46:25.805 --> 02:46:28.668]  I mean, now is the time.
[02:46:28.748 --> 02:46:29.689]  Get Terror Storm.
[02:46:29.749 --> 02:46:30.470]  Make copies.
[02:46:30.530 --> 02:46:31.691]  Buy five machines.
[02:46:32.071 --> 02:46:32.592]  Start making.
[02:46:32.632 --> 02:46:34.053]  I mean, just get aggressive.
[02:46:34.473 --> 02:46:37.616]  I mean, just be wallowing in DVDs.
[02:46:38.257 --> 02:46:42.421]  Go cover every church window, every car window outside churches every weekend.
[02:46:42.701 --> 02:46:43.662]  Get 10 of your friends.
[02:46:43.722 --> 02:46:44.543]  Go crazy.
[02:46:45.163 --> 02:46:46.825]  I mean, just expose the Federal Reserve.
[02:46:46.885 --> 02:46:48.486]  Expose us behind the terrorism.
[02:46:48.826 --> 02:46:49.427]  We're winning.
[02:46:49.467 --> 02:46:50.708]  The people don't trust the government.
[02:46:50.748 --> 02:46:54.611]  They still aren't sophisticated enough, though, to figure out how the game is played.
[02:46:54.631 --> 02:46:55.772]  They know there's a scam.
[02:46:56.072 --> 02:46:58.154]  They know something stinks under the floorboards.
[02:46:58.394 --> 02:46:59.675]  But they don't know what it is.
[02:47:00.216 --> 02:47:00.956]  I'm telling you.
[02:47:01.577 --> 02:47:02.878]  Go to Amazon.com.
[02:47:02.938 --> 02:47:05.060]  Send TerrorStorm to number one.
[02:47:06.661 --> 02:47:07.282]  I'm telling you.
[02:47:07.302 --> 02:47:08.823]  I'm asking you to help us, folks.
[02:47:09.263 --> 02:47:11.645]  I put TerrorStorm up for free on Google Video.
[02:47:11.665 --> 02:47:12.206]  So did Aaron.
[02:47:13.351 --> 02:47:14.911]  Spread that link around to everybody.
[02:47:15.292 --> 02:47:16.872]  You have no excuses!
[02:47:18.352 --> 02:47:19.853]  I mean, they're taking over, folks.
[02:47:19.933 --> 02:47:20.533]  FEMA camps.
[02:47:20.573 --> 02:47:21.733]  Concentration camps.
[02:47:22.594 --> 02:47:23.914]  Aaron, this isn't a joke, is it?
[02:47:24.074 --> 02:47:25.014]  I mean, they've got a plan.
[02:47:25.254 --> 02:47:26.695]  What else is there left to say?
[02:47:26.735 --> 02:47:27.855]  Your country's at stake.
[02:47:27.975 --> 02:47:28.896]  Everything's at risk.
[02:47:28.916 --> 02:47:29.876]  Your life is at stake.
[02:47:29.916 --> 02:47:30.816]  The future of America.
[02:47:31.096 --> 02:47:34.457]  Look, America's been a free country for a short window in time.
[02:47:34.577 --> 02:47:36.698]  They're trying to arrest Wesley Snipes.
[02:47:36.778 --> 02:47:37.418]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:47:37.958 --> 02:47:39.679]  I'm just saying America's been a free country.
[02:47:39.719 --> 02:47:40.719]  It's been a short window.
[02:47:41.172 --> 02:47:43.853]  Throughout history, we've had freedom for only a little while.
[02:47:44.354 --> 02:47:46.255]  Throughout all of recorded history.
[02:47:46.615 --> 02:47:47.555]  And we're losing it.
[02:47:47.855 --> 02:47:49.656]  And we're giving it back the way it used to be.
[02:47:50.077 --> 02:47:51.457]  And we have a chance to stop it.
[02:47:51.737 --> 02:47:53.738]  There's nothing you shouldn't do.
[02:47:53.798 --> 02:47:56.280]  There's no limit to what you should do to preserve your liberty.
[02:47:56.360 --> 02:47:56.880]  No limit!
[02:47:57.180 --> 02:47:57.680]  Get out there.
[02:47:57.700 --> 02:47:58.501]  There is no limit.
[02:47:58.541 --> 02:48:00.302]  Get out there and buy DVDs.
[02:48:00.342 --> 02:48:01.202]  Spread the DVDs.
[02:48:01.262 --> 02:48:01.943]  Make copies.
[02:48:01.963 --> 02:48:04.804]  Get out on the street and hand them out to people.
[02:48:05.104 --> 02:48:06.385]  Wake people up.
[02:48:06.585 --> 02:48:08.566]  Don't sit back and take this nonsense.
[02:48:08.746 --> 02:48:10.548]  Yes, we put these films out for free.
[02:48:10.568 --> 02:48:15.413]  And I don't know why I don't say this, but I'm going to say it now.
[02:48:15.934 --> 02:48:18.797]  I want you to order thousands of these DVDs right now.
[02:48:18.817 --> 02:48:21.080]  And I want you to make thousands of copies.
[02:48:21.320 --> 02:48:23.642]  And if thousands of you do that, it will be tens of millions.
[02:48:24.143 --> 02:48:27.547]  I want you to literally go to the window right now, like they do in network.
[02:48:28.067 --> 02:48:32.593]  Stick your head out and scream, Death to the New World Order!
[02:48:32.994 --> 02:48:34.956]  Death to the New World Order!
[02:48:35.097 --> 02:48:36.619]  Death to the Federal Reserve!
[02:48:36.939 --> 02:48:38.641]  We're coming for you, David Rockefeller.
[02:48:38.882 --> 02:48:40.343]  We're coming for you, Rothschild.
[02:48:40.604 --> 02:48:42.666]  Final segment with Aaron Russo.
[02:48:42.827 --> 02:48:44.990]  Get the DVD now!
[02:48:48.729 --> 02:48:51.891]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[02:48:52.231 --> 02:48:54.172]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[02:48:54.533 --> 02:49:02.218]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:49:02.878 --> 02:49:09.922]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:49:10.323 --> 02:49:13.305]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iraq.
[02:49:13.665 --> 02:49:15.966]  A White House program to disseminate fake news.
[02:49:16.406 --> 02:49:17.227]  NSA spies.
[02:49:17.799 --> 02:49:21.040]  Or by calling toll-free 1-888-253-3139 or watch it right now online at prisonplanet.tv
[02:49:45.307 --> 02:49:50.408]  Black Berkey purification elements are more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[02:49:50.468 --> 02:49:57.770]  These awesome elements are used in Berkey purification systems, and they can also be used to upgrade most other gravity filtration systems.
[02:49:57.930 --> 02:50:08.552]  They can purify raw, untreated water by removing pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, trihalomethanes, and chemicals such as chlorine, atrazine, styrene, and MTBE.
[02:50:08.752 --> 02:50:13.313]  These elements also reduce unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[02:50:13.353 --> 02:50:14.394]  We're good to go.
[02:50:32.776 --> 02:50:34.138]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.

[02:52:07.344 --> 02:52:08.785]  Let's talk to Dee in Texas.
[02:52:08.825 --> 02:52:10.146]  You're on the air with Aaron Russo.
[02:52:10.166 --> 02:52:10.846]  Dee, go ahead.
[02:52:12.367 --> 02:52:18.652]  Alex, I ordered my copy of Terror Storm this morning from Amazon, so hopefully that will help your numbers there.
[02:52:18.672 --> 02:52:19.072]  Thank you.
[02:52:19.512 --> 02:52:20.793]  I have a question for Aaron.
[02:52:21.934 --> 02:52:32.661]  Alex, I attended your Terror Storm preview in Dallas, and I also attended the premiere of American Fascism to Freedom in Dallas as well.
[02:52:33.669 --> 02:52:40.323]  The stranglehold that the IRS and the Federal Reserve have on the American people that is immensely difficult to understand that system.
[02:52:41.275 --> 02:52:48.279]  However, has anybody ever stopped to think that maybe the IRS and the Federal Reserve only apply in Washington, D.C.
[02:52:48.319 --> 02:52:49.460]  and the federal territories?
[02:52:49.480 --> 02:52:50.380]  Yeah, that's the whole point.
[02:52:50.420 --> 02:52:52.101]  But again, it's all color of law fraud.
[02:52:52.121 --> 02:52:53.842]  It's like they say you've got to take vaccines.
[02:52:54.202 --> 02:52:57.644]  There's no law, but they'll still arrest you playing little legalese tricks.
[02:52:58.004 --> 02:53:02.167]  And then the judges, when it's not even a law, people go to prison all the time for not even violating laws.
[02:53:02.867 --> 02:53:05.929]  People go to prison for writing, you know, and suing government officials.
[02:53:06.449 --> 02:53:07.570]  Aaron Russo, you want to comment?
[02:53:08.261 --> 02:53:09.842]  Yeah, they do it by force.
[02:53:09.882 --> 02:53:11.002]  It doesn't matter what the law is.
[02:53:11.042 --> 02:53:12.342]  They do whatever they want to do.
[02:53:12.742 --> 02:53:14.003]  That's what people have to understand.
[02:53:14.043 --> 02:53:21.825]  I keep hearing all these pages talk about all these technicalities, how to go around this, and how to go around this, and the UCC, and the yellow fringe.
[02:53:21.865 --> 02:53:22.526]  They don't care.
[02:53:22.546 --> 02:53:23.906]  They got men with machine guns.
[02:53:23.926 --> 02:53:24.806]  They don't give a damn.
[02:53:24.826 --> 02:53:25.987]  They don't care about any of that.
[02:53:26.307 --> 02:53:27.887]  They'll do whatever they want to do.
[02:53:28.227 --> 02:53:29.108]  The courts are fixed.
[02:53:29.188 --> 02:53:30.508]  It's all a rigged game.
[02:53:31.008 --> 02:53:33.469]  So what you need to do is take back the country.
[02:53:33.925 --> 02:53:43.730]  We need to take back America and put people back in office who are statesmen, who believe in the Constitution, who believe in freedom of the individual, and not the institutions controlling it.
[02:53:43.750 --> 02:53:51.053]  And the key is, stop believing the lies, distrust them all, know they're criminals, and just don't go along with the system.
[02:53:51.093 --> 02:53:53.194]  Don't go to churches where they tell you to lay down with the government.
[02:53:53.514 --> 02:53:55.115]  Don't have friends that are scum.
[02:53:55.135 --> 02:53:59.137]  And scum by scum, I mean people who don't care, people who aren't involved.
[02:53:59.657 --> 02:54:01.558]  I mean, we've got to get aggressive and mean.
[02:54:01.578 --> 02:54:03.299]  That's the answer.
[02:54:04.501 --> 02:54:05.742]  I just wanted to make another comment.
[02:54:05.922 --> 02:54:10.565]  Just like Aaron said, they don't care what the laws are.
[02:54:11.045 --> 02:54:21.192]  But another part of that is that so many of the people, whenever they hear about the IRS or they hear about the Patriot Act or the Federal Reserve, they honestly, in their souls, think that that applies to them.
[02:54:21.272 --> 02:54:22.132]  And it does not.
[02:54:22.492 --> 02:54:23.993]  And that's what we have to change.
[02:54:24.053 --> 02:54:25.534]  We have to change the minds of the people.
[02:54:25.554 --> 02:54:25.994]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:54:26.055 --> 02:54:26.395]  That's right.
[02:54:26.415 --> 02:54:26.915]  I appreciate that.
[02:54:26.935 --> 02:54:27.195]  Go ahead.
[02:54:29.002 --> 02:54:33.766]  Oh, and we have to make it simple enough so that the working man that's putting in 60 hours a week can understand.
[02:54:33.786 --> 02:54:37.529]  Yeah, I mean, it's a private tax to a private bank, and none of it goes to the country.
[02:54:37.549 --> 02:54:40.391]  It goes to the interest on the debt, and it's designed to create debt from the beginning.
[02:54:40.431 --> 02:54:43.894]  It's a debt vortex, a debt black hole they've built.
[02:54:44.574 --> 02:54:46.716]  And first you've just got to get mad, folks.
[02:54:46.996 --> 02:54:48.157]  And look, we are getting mad.
[02:54:48.177 --> 02:54:49.819]  They're having to have staged elections now.
[02:54:50.139 --> 02:54:50.859]  They're in trouble.
[02:54:51.400 --> 02:54:52.501]  We're gaining ground.
[02:54:52.561 --> 02:54:53.341]  That's the good news.
[02:54:53.642 --> 02:54:55.163]  People are ready to wake up now.
[02:54:55.203 --> 02:54:56.204]  Don't you agree, Aaron Russo?
[02:54:56.764 --> 02:54:59.186]  Look, everybody can smell a rat.
[02:55:00.087 --> 02:55:01.788]  The question is, how do you kill the rat?
[02:55:02.589 --> 02:55:05.091]  We all know the smell is there, but how do we kill it?
[02:55:05.131 --> 02:55:05.892]  How do we get rid of it?
[02:55:05.912 --> 02:55:07.693]  I'm going to have you on two hours next week.
[02:55:07.733 --> 02:55:09.255]  We appreciate you, Aaron Russo.
[02:55:09.635 --> 02:55:10.596]  God bless you, my friend.
[02:55:10.616 --> 02:55:11.036]  Take care.
[02:55:11.577 --> 02:55:11.977]  Thank you.
[02:55:12.858 --> 02:55:13.438]  All right, folks.
[02:55:13.458 --> 02:55:14.799]  I'll be back tonight, 9 to midnight.
[02:55:14.839 --> 02:55:15.820]  Back tomorrow, 11 to 2.
[02:55:15.880 --> 02:55:20.244]  More continual coverage here on the Genesis Network or on the great stations that carry this broadcast.
[02:55:20.264 --> 02:55:21.305]  We're very thankful for it.
[02:55:22.065 --> 02:55:25.908]  They're putting in Bill Gates over the Secretary of Defense, CIA mole.
[02:55:26.288 --> 02:55:27.649]  Not Bill Gates, Robert Gates.
[02:55:28.509 --> 02:55:33.973]  And they've got an Air Force general running the CIA.
[02:55:34.653 --> 02:55:36.955]  They're going to open the borders up, go after your guns.
[02:55:37.575 --> 02:55:38.616]  Bush will sign it all.
[02:55:39.576 --> 02:55:42.018]  And you'll still suck your thumb as conservatives and say you didn't.
[02:55:42.098 --> 02:55:42.818]  I know you're sick.
[02:55:42.838 --> 02:55:44.500]  I know there's neocons listening.
[02:55:44.520 --> 02:55:45.160]  I'm talking to them.

[02:56:03.284 --> 02:56:05.966]  It came about, what, eight places away from that.
