[00:00:05.453 --> 00:00:06.094]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.754 --> 00:00:07.815]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.515 --> 00:00:09.676]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.276 --> 00:00:11.097]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.857 --> 00:00:12.718]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.418 --> 00:00:17.080]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.601 --> 00:00:21.743]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:21.923 --> 00:00:23.844]  Music
[00:00:40.957 --> 00:00:41.838]  Welcome, my friends.
[00:00:41.938 --> 00:00:51.323]  Welcome to all of you listening across the United States and worldwide as well as the ships at sea, our military forces in foreign lands.
[00:00:51.403 --> 00:00:52.664]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:00:54.292 --> 00:01:05.536]  Now already on this Thursday edition, the 21st day of December 2006, I'm going to attempt to control myself today and take a lot of your phone calls in the first hour and a half.
[00:01:06.077 --> 00:01:14.900]  Then we are scheduled to have one of the main anthropologists live in studio who worked on the film Apocalypto with Mel Gibson.
[00:01:16.827 --> 00:01:19.808]  And it'll be the last time I talk about Apocalypto at any length.
[00:01:20.228 --> 00:01:23.088]  I interviewed her Sunday, and it was just amazing.
[00:01:23.128 --> 00:01:31.970]  But in the hour we had, only 40 minutes of that radio time on the new Sunday show I do, we were unable to get into all the facets I wanted to cover.
[00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.691]  And it's not just about Apocalypto or the Aztecs or the Mayan.
[00:01:36.291 --> 00:01:46.293]  It's about the mindset of the professors, the anthropologists at major universities that came out and said that human sacrifice is, quote, valid.
[00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.653]  That it is something that is basically good.
[00:01:51.673 --> 00:02:03.362]  I have the quotes here, and this is the attitude out of what I guess you'd call the mainline left, that every culture is good but Western culture.
[00:02:03.902 --> 00:02:10.807]  Well, I think every culture is independent of itself, but basically similar in that we have a blood lust.
[00:02:11.641 --> 00:02:17.311]  There is a wish for carnage and destruction and bloodletting.
[00:02:17.371 --> 00:02:19.575]  It doesn't matter if you're an Asian.
[00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:41.684]  In Mesoamerica, and that's what those folks are and were, or whether you are a Germanic tribe in the hills of Deutschland, or if you are a Druid in England, or the Romans with their form of human sacrifice in the arena, why does this run through the course of human history?
[00:02:41.704 --> 00:02:49.066]  We'll be talking to a preeminent anthropologist on this subject who speaks fluent ancient Mayan,
[00:02:50.746 --> 00:02:58.448]  And she'll be in studio with us, and she'll also talk about some of her interactions with Mel Gibson in the post-production of the film.
[00:02:59.809 --> 00:03:01.349]  But that is in the second half.
[00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:08.372]  In the first half, any news story, any item, any question, any comment you've got, you're welcome.
[00:03:08.432 --> 00:03:09.592]  We don't screen your calls.
[00:03:09.612 --> 00:03:12.573]  You can come on board with us anytime you wish at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:03:12.613 --> 00:03:14.854]  I want to first, after the break, get into the Iraq War some.
[00:03:19.995 --> 00:03:24.340]  I'm sure you've already heard, now they want $99.7 billion.
[00:03:25.302 --> 00:03:29.787]  They want almost $100 billion in supplemental spending package.
[00:03:31.509 --> 00:03:35.814]  That will be $170 billion allotted for the war next year alone, just for the war.
[00:03:40.842 --> 00:03:51.144]  We now have a defense budget that in the last six years has ballooned from $500 billion to $800 plus billion a year.
[00:03:51.164 --> 00:03:56.805]  Now when you hear on the news, you'll hear that the main spending is $600 billion.
[00:03:58.425 --> 00:04:04.266]  But then when you add in all the other supplementals, we are getting very, very close to $1 trillion a year.
[00:04:08.472 --> 00:04:11.975]  One trillion dollars a year.
[00:04:12.055 --> 00:04:16.417]  And of course, most of that goes into no-bid contracts and scams.
[00:04:17.558 --> 00:04:21.180]  And the final juice is being sucked out of the country.
[00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:25.383]  The New World Order spider is basically finishing off our innards.
[00:04:26.284 --> 00:04:34.649]  My main goal is that when the depression comes, when the massive crash comes, the globalists will be dancing around, posing as your saviors yet again.
[00:04:36.295 --> 00:04:40.736]  I want you at that point to at least know your enemy and know who did it to you.
[00:04:41.437 --> 00:04:43.357]  They've already knocked us over, okay?
[00:04:44.417 --> 00:04:45.958]  They've already hit us and hit us hard.
[00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:49.379]  But most Americans are delusional and don't know that.
[00:04:49.499 --> 00:04:59.182]  So we're here so that as things become more apparent to you, you will then become completely enraged and join us in the fight against the new world order.
[00:05:04.309 --> 00:05:07.411]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[00:05:07.772 --> 00:05:09.713]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[00:05:10.073 --> 00:05:17.759]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:25.485]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:05:25.885 --> 00:05:28.807]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran.
[00:05:29.167 --> 00:05:31.529]  The White House program to disseminate fake news.
[00:05:31.949 --> 00:05:32.790]  NSA spies.
[00:05:33.326 --> 00:05:34.627]  Or by calling toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[00:05:34.687 --> 00:05:36.587]  Or watch it right now online at prisonplanet.tv.
[00:06:00.785 --> 00:06:03.907]  These elements also reduce unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[00:06:28.865 --> 00:06:29.846]  We're good to go.
[00:06:58.865 --> 00:06:59.606]  We're good to go.
[00:07:22.643 --> 00:07:29.845]  Day of Jubilee has created a successful program designed for people that want to stop harassing calls and threatening letters from bill collectors.
[00:07:30.285 --> 00:07:32.106]  We also do credit restoration.
[00:07:32.566 --> 00:07:38.828]  Join the thousands of Americans who now breathe a sigh of relief because they have legally eliminated their credit card debt.
[00:07:39.108 --> 00:07:40.969]  Don't wait any longer to get your life back in order.
[00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:07.585]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.795 --> 00:08:24.882]  Modern mainline so-called conservative talk radio is there to neutralize conservatives...
[00:08:25.723 --> 00:08:26.244]  We're good to go.
[00:08:43.564 --> 00:08:49.786]  And I heard two different national talk show hosts as I was skipping around on the dial saying, you're going to love this.
[00:08:49.866 --> 00:08:50.486]  Get ready.
[00:08:50.826 --> 00:08:52.326]  You're going to love this.
[00:08:52.907 --> 00:09:00.188]  And then they would come back with some horrible news about what they call liberals, you know, what they're out doing to the country.
[00:09:01.969 --> 00:09:03.149]  You see, we don't love it.
[00:09:03.189 --> 00:09:05.650]  We don't say, you're going to love this.
[00:09:06.542 --> 00:09:10.868]  Like we get all excited and upset about it, but they never give you any solutions.
[00:09:11.169 --> 00:09:12.050]  That's what they do.
[00:09:12.130 --> 00:09:13.372]  We try to give you solutions.
[00:09:15.395 --> 00:09:16.697]  It just makes me so sick.
[00:09:18.048 --> 00:09:41.501]  Or while they've got you all horrified of Kwanzaa, which wouldn't even get any traction if they didn't give it so much attention, or while they've got you worried about the boogeymen of the Muslims are going to get you, they say nothing about how the government, both Republican and Democrat, are doing everything they can to get rid of our borders and bring in unlimited amounts of third world populations from every corner of the globe.
[00:09:44.099 --> 00:09:47.400]  And I started the show with this yesterday, and I'm going to do it again.
[00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:54.543]  I was on a national talk show with Lars Larson, and he was defending the North American Union now.
[00:09:55.103 --> 00:10:08.068]  I'm a liberal conspiracy theorist because I'm against it, and it's for the security of America, and it's free market, and let's just hand our infrastructure over to foreign companies.
[00:10:10.549 --> 00:10:11.870]  Of course, it wasn't selling.
[00:10:14.151 --> 00:10:16.752]  Every caller that called in while I was on agreed.
[00:10:17.912 --> 00:10:22.534]  They couldn't find callers that disagreed with me, so they just stopped going to calls.
[00:10:22.554 --> 00:10:27.836]  And then later in the show, the callers all agreed with me after I was gone.
[00:10:30.497 --> 00:10:35.639]  And that's because we've actually won the fight for the hearts and minds of the American people.
[00:10:37.722 --> 00:10:42.946]  I mean, I could start the show today with the fact that the Pentagon wants a supplemental funding of $99.7 trillion.
[00:10:42.966 --> 00:10:43.466]  $99.7 trillion.
[00:10:43.486 --> 00:10:44.267]  Excuse me, $99.7 billion.
[00:10:44.287 --> 00:10:48.069]  That's $99.7 billion added to what they're doing.
[00:11:08.471 --> 00:11:16.953]  And we can talk about how the war's wrong and how it's designed to give America a bad name, how we're being used by the globalists to do their dirty work.
[00:11:16.993 --> 00:11:18.613]  We can talk about that all day long.
[00:11:22.314 --> 00:11:23.074]  But what's the point?
[00:11:25.095 --> 00:11:29.376]  In major polls, it's almost 80%, I keep saying 70%, it's almost 80% that want the war to end, that want our...
[00:11:34.241 --> 00:11:34.901]  We're good to go.
[00:11:34.941 --> 00:11:35.262]  I think?
[00:11:53.951 --> 00:11:56.072]  So actually, we call the American people dumb.
[00:11:56.653 --> 00:11:58.254]  To a certain extent, they're not dumb.
[00:11:58.274 --> 00:11:59.695]  They're just not totally informed.
[00:11:59.995 --> 00:12:01.416]  And they know the war is a fraud.
[00:12:01.456 --> 00:12:02.756]  They know we were lied to war.
[00:12:03.157 --> 00:12:04.597]  They know it's bad for the troops.
[00:12:05.138 --> 00:12:09.180]  They know the CIA assessment states that our troops being there makes it worse.
[00:12:11.041 --> 00:12:14.183]  So why should I sit here and address the 22, 23% of Americans?
[00:12:17.981 --> 00:12:30.224]  Or the 30% of the troops that want to stay in a foreign land so defense contractors can make a bunch of money and so the oil won't flow so the oil companies can try to keep the price of oil high.
[00:12:33.084 --> 00:12:43.227]  Because I was all ready to go on the air and give an impassioned diatribe against the war and go over the evidences, but the people know a lot of the evidence.
[00:12:43.267 --> 00:12:44.487]  They know it's a bad war.
[00:12:46.801 --> 00:13:02.613]  So really, the only illusion there is in the delusional 22-23% who are listening out there, who don't care what the American people want, don't care what the Constitution says, don't care if we were lied to war.
[00:13:02.973 --> 00:13:06.676]  For them, they've got to have, quote, victory.
[00:13:08.658 --> 00:13:10.139]  It's an ego thing.
[00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:14.202]  And you can tell them, hey...
[00:13:14.941 --> 00:13:16.122]  Here's the Pentagon plan.
[00:13:16.142 --> 00:13:17.323]  Here's the Israeli plan.
[00:13:17.523 --> 00:13:18.984]  They plan to stay there decades.
[00:13:19.285 --> 00:13:20.706]  Victory is not what they wanted.
[00:13:20.886 --> 00:13:28.272]  They could have gone in, kept the police apparatus in place, and left in just six months.
[00:13:28.592 --> 00:13:30.313]  They could have gotten the water and power on.
[00:13:30.353 --> 00:13:31.654]  The generals weren't allowed to.
[00:13:32.095 --> 00:13:39.281]  Our government has been caught with its agents staging bombing attacks on the British, the U.S., and the Israelis to stir up sectarian violence.
[00:13:39.541 --> 00:13:43.264]  Do you understand it's a meat grinder into which our troops are being crammed?
[00:13:44.952 --> 00:13:48.573]  What you call victory isn't going to be allowed.
[00:13:49.754 --> 00:13:56.317]  And they still look at you and go, well, I heard you say all this was going to happen, and you're right about it.
[00:13:56.618 --> 00:14:00.600]  A lot of these conservatives, if they want to be called conservatives, fine, you're conservatives.
[00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:06.503]  I call you phony conservatives, brainwashed conservatives, mixed-up conservatives.
[00:14:08.203 --> 00:14:10.645]  I mean, there's not one of you out there that can say I was wrong.
[00:14:10.685 --> 00:14:12.047]  I told you exactly what would happen.
[00:14:12.087 --> 00:14:12.667]  Wasn't hard.
[00:14:12.687 --> 00:14:14.689]  It was an official battle plan.
[00:14:14.709 --> 00:14:18.192]  Again, wasn't hard.
[00:14:18.412 --> 00:14:21.215]  Just read what the CFR and the New World Order said was going to happen.
[00:14:21.535 --> 00:14:23.337]  Just read what the Pentagon said the plan was.
[00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:29.282]  But in the final equation, it doesn't matter.
[00:14:29.342 --> 00:14:30.363]  If this is a republic...
[00:14:31.460 --> 00:14:32.841]  And this is a nation of laws.
[00:14:33.181 --> 00:14:35.023]  The Congress never voted for the war.
[00:14:35.303 --> 00:14:37.024]  The Congress never declared war.
[00:14:37.345 --> 00:14:43.830]  And I hear these neocons on talk radio saying, how dare congressmen go on fact-finding missions to the Middle East?
[00:14:44.390 --> 00:14:47.513]  How dare congressmen question the war?
[00:14:47.613 --> 00:14:48.573]  We're in a war.
[00:14:48.954 --> 00:14:51.816]  You've got to support the executive and not question him.
[00:14:52.316 --> 00:14:52.677]  What?
[00:14:53.217 --> 00:14:54.878]  Congress levies war.
[00:14:55.259 --> 00:14:56.980]  Congress prescribes war.
[00:14:57.340 --> 00:14:59.282]  Congress writes up a declaration.
[00:15:01.508 --> 00:15:03.790]  But no, that's why they don't declare wars anymore.
[00:15:04.230 --> 00:15:20.303]  And they've gone from 50 years ago, every American knew the President prosecuted a war and did what Congress said, executed the war, till today, even most liberals think you're not supposed to question the President or that he's the one that wages war.
[00:15:21.764 --> 00:15:24.646]  He's the guy that decides how the war is going to be run.
[00:15:25.407 --> 00:15:28.529]  That's why there's an Armed Services Committee in the House and Senate.
[00:15:28.949 --> 00:15:29.370]  They...
[00:15:30.558 --> 00:15:34.721]  Make the decisions, and the President executes them.
[00:15:35.161 --> 00:15:37.143]  Now go read the Constitution.
[00:15:37.303 --> 00:15:38.644]  Go read the subsections.
[00:15:38.864 --> 00:15:40.265]  We've read them here on air before.
[00:15:42.327 --> 00:15:53.815]  So you've got 78% of Americans in major polls, 78 or 77, depending on which poll, scientific polls against the war...
[00:15:54.756 --> 00:15:57.097]  The troops, 70%, want to come home.
[00:15:57.837 --> 00:16:03.219]  The government's own assessments, that they don't like to publicize, but are public, say our troops being there makes it worse.
[00:16:03.959 --> 00:16:18.103]  Pentagon battle plans saying, break it in three parts, sectarian war, build permanent bases, de-industrialize, spread civil war into the entire region, get the Arabs all killing each other, and it's working like a charm.
[00:16:18.123 --> 00:16:20.784]  People say, Bush has failed, the war is a disaster.
[00:16:22.259 --> 00:16:24.820]  Well, it's a disaster for you when your son doesn't come home.
[00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:29.022]  It's a disaster for you when your son's going to get lung cancer from DU.
[00:16:29.622 --> 00:16:30.342]  And you're sitting there.
[00:16:30.362 --> 00:16:34.504]  You'll probably finally wake up then when his guts are pouring out on those sheets.
[00:16:38.505 --> 00:16:41.346]  Out their orifices.
[00:16:42.947 --> 00:16:45.708]  You'll finally, finally hit your knees and throw up.
[00:16:46.633 --> 00:16:50.956]  And repent to God for the fraud that you've helped empower.
[00:16:51.577 --> 00:16:52.938]  Support the troops.
[00:16:53.539 --> 00:16:54.139]  Victory.
[00:16:56.641 --> 00:17:02.345]  The government said from the start, victory was decades of war, never leaving.
[00:17:05.728 --> 00:17:12.233]  Millions of dead Iraqis, 654,000 in the last three and a half years.
[00:17:12.653 --> 00:17:13.414]  That's victory.
[00:17:13.614 --> 00:17:15.716]  And America demonized worldwide.
[00:17:17.722 --> 00:17:21.305]  The biggest media owner in the world, news-wise, is News Corp.
[00:17:22.246 --> 00:17:27.531]  Their newspapers, their television stations demonize America from Australia to Germany to England.
[00:17:29.072 --> 00:17:33.055]  But here domestically, it's so two-sided, folks.
[00:17:34.376 --> 00:17:39.161]  We, the American people, have gone from the most loved to the most hated by design.
[00:17:39.201 --> 00:17:42.123]  The very same globalists tried this with the Vietnam War.
[00:17:43.044 --> 00:17:44.345]  Fifteen-year war from 1964.
[00:17:46.194 --> 00:17:53.482]  To 1975, officially kicked off, but still no declaration in 64, with another staged event, Gulf of Tonkin.
[00:17:56.565 --> 00:18:02.211]  And so even those of you out there that support the war, do you support the will of the American people?
[00:18:03.032 --> 00:18:04.714]  Almost 80% are against it.
[00:18:06.296 --> 00:18:07.477]  The troops are against it.
[00:18:08.385 --> 00:18:12.428]  The troops have been ordered to re-up repeatedly with stop-loss.
[00:18:12.909 --> 00:18:15.731]  They're being drafted, as you deny there's even a draft.
[00:18:17.232 --> 00:18:21.576]  They're being used like birdcage liner and toilet paper by the globalists.
[00:18:23.738 --> 00:18:26.660]  So do you have any respect even for the American people?
[00:18:27.321 --> 00:18:28.101]  No, no, no.
[00:18:28.142 --> 00:18:29.683]  It's like a football game for you.
[00:18:30.820 --> 00:18:35.264]  No, we've got to win, and then the government can't even tell you what winning is.
[00:18:35.764 --> 00:18:38.646]  But if you want to go read what their actual... It's like the drug war.
[00:18:39.087 --> 00:18:46.052]  The cops will tell you, well, yeah, there's more drugs than ever, and more people in prison, and more problems, but we're going to win this war.
[00:18:46.092 --> 00:18:47.974]  We've just got to get rid of the whole Bill of Rights.
[00:18:49.503 --> 00:18:55.027]  The war was never meant to be won according to the stated goals of eradicating narcotics.
[00:18:55.488 --> 00:19:14.763]  The narcotics trafficking corporations that had a monopoly into this country had lost their monopoly and Prohibition had ended so they lost that cash cow and so they lobbied to make narcotics illegal and to create federal police and arm them to go after drug dealers and that was back in the 20s and it's never going to end!
[00:19:17.282 --> 00:19:19.263]  It'll be here in a hundred years!
[00:19:21.705 --> 00:19:25.147]  And it doesn't matter if drug use has more than doubled in the last ten years.
[00:19:25.647 --> 00:19:29.270]  It doesn't matter if every five years the war on drugs funding doubles.
[00:19:31.771 --> 00:19:32.772]  None of that matters.
[00:19:33.432 --> 00:19:35.333]  And it's never going to matter to you.
[00:19:35.353 --> 00:19:37.495]  You just like war!
[00:19:39.975 --> 00:19:44.219]  And you're so foolish, you don't know the wars against you.
[00:19:44.780 --> 00:19:52.787]  You're cheering for a war that's against the Bill of Rights and Constitution by a pack of criminals.
[00:20:01.158 --> 00:20:02.138]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[00:20:02.218 --> 00:20:07.001]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[00:20:07.161 --> 00:20:14.964]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[00:20:15.224 --> 00:20:20.607]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[00:20:20.807 --> 00:20:27.790]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[00:20:28.030 --> 00:20:28.510]  We're good to go.
[00:20:46.696 --> 00:20:52.937]  While paper investments currently have been driven by debt, gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years.
[00:20:53.258 --> 00:20:56.778]  For more information, call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:20:57.118 --> 00:21:00.019]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:00.399 --> 00:21:03.420]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:08.641]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[00:21:08.901 --> 00:21:13.182]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[00:21:13.562 --> 00:21:22.471]  The KDF Shower Filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[00:21:22.671 --> 00:21:26.314]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[00:21:26.594 --> 00:21:31.639]  The KDF Shower Filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:38.626]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[00:21:39.116 --> 00:21:39.777]  What about you?
[00:21:40.417 --> 00:21:45.782]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.
[00:21:45.842 --> 00:21:46.923]  Call now to order at 1-888-803-4438.
[00:21:47.003 --> 00:21:48.904]  Order today and save $14 by calling 1-888-803-4438.
[00:22:00.811 --> 00:22:01.152]  Thank you.
[00:22:15.691 --> 00:22:16.171]  We're good to go.
[00:22:33.104 --> 00:22:33.524]  516-8736.
[00:22:36.726 --> 00:22:39.429]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[00:22:42.691 --> 00:22:46.274]  Just call for a one-year free subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[00:22:46.815 --> 00:22:47.315]  It's free.
[00:22:47.395 --> 00:22:50.818]  Call now while operators are standing by to take your call.
[00:23:03.364 --> 00:23:05.325]  Do you know the truth about breast cancer?
[00:23:05.825 --> 00:23:08.247]  Do you realize that the race for the cure is over?
[00:23:09.027 --> 00:23:17.450]  The best-kept secret in the world today is that now it's possible to kill cancer without personal suffering, mutilation, and poisoning of your entire system.
[00:23:18.411 --> 00:23:23.273]  Now it's cancer's turn to die with LaysMed Incorporated's patented methodology.
[00:23:23.948 --> 00:23:33.935]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation, we can destroy skin cancer and breast tumors of any size without adverse side effects at a physician's office.
[00:23:34.436 --> 00:23:36.737]  Star War technology at its best.
[00:23:37.518 --> 00:23:38.759]  For more information, call 702-953-0267.
[00:23:38.779 --> 00:23:38.819]  702-953-0267.
[00:23:47.503 --> 00:23:51.665]  I mean, this is a supposed free country with the will of the people, right?
[00:24:18.506 --> 00:24:21.488]  97% don't want existing roads being seized and turned into toll roads.
[00:24:24.089 --> 00:24:34.232]  99% don't like Supreme Court rulings saying private interest can take your property if they lobby local governments, openly says they can pay them off.
[00:24:34.693 --> 00:24:35.913]  90% don't want open borders.
[00:24:37.954 --> 00:24:39.695]  You can go right down the line.
[00:24:40.635 --> 00:24:43.056]  Americans don't like what our government's doing.
[00:24:44.042 --> 00:24:47.965]  Almost 80% don't like the war, but it doesn't matter.
[00:24:49.225 --> 00:24:59.632]  So I just want the people that are pro-war, who think they're running things and think they're part of the system, and I want you to really think about the fact that it doesn't matter what you think.
[00:24:59.672 --> 00:25:01.213]  It could be 100% of us.
[00:25:01.813 --> 00:25:04.995]  The New World Order is going to continue on with what they're doing.
[00:25:06.056 --> 00:25:07.497]  They do not care.
[00:25:08.453 --> 00:25:10.674]  And so I want you to consciously understand that.
[00:25:11.054 --> 00:25:19.258]  Because so many of these people who go along with the New World Order and make excuses for it, they think they're part of the power structure.
[00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:28.623]  They're associating their whole identity with George Bush.
[00:25:29.531 --> 00:25:34.054]  George Bush, Hillary, Chuckie Schumer, Reid, they're all for the war.
[00:25:34.394 --> 00:25:36.836]  They're not just for leaving the troops like they were.
[00:25:36.856 --> 00:25:39.838]  Oh, no, no, no, Bush has said he doesn't want more troops.
[00:25:39.938 --> 00:25:44.922]  They're saying we want even more, which is exactly what the Pentagon was actually calling for.
[00:25:46.643 --> 00:25:57.050]  And now they're Shanghai-ing, we've confirmed this, they're Shanghai-ing regular Navy and regular Air Force out troops.
[00:25:58.090 --> 00:26:10.716]  Of their services that they signed up for enforcing them into ground forces, and they've got four carrier groups that have been in the Gulf for a month, the Persian Gulf, and we told you that was a threat in Iran.
[00:26:10.936 --> 00:26:16.119]  Well, now the White House says, I have the AP right here, that this is a threat to Iran.
[00:26:18.700 --> 00:26:22.442]  And again, you've got good old boys out there, but it doesn't matter that you're there supporting it.
[00:26:22.462 --> 00:26:23.262]  They don't even need you.
[00:26:23.742 --> 00:26:24.763]  Let's just be clear about that.
[00:26:25.367 --> 00:26:28.268]  But still, it's important to look at your psychology, that 22%.
[00:26:29.629 --> 00:26:31.269]  You think it's manly.
[00:26:31.669 --> 00:26:34.730]  You think it's manly to attack another country.
[00:26:34.790 --> 00:26:35.891]  You think it's cool.
[00:26:37.231 --> 00:26:45.174]  At a primitive level, you're with Team America, Tribe America, and you're standing firm with great courage.
[00:26:45.374 --> 00:26:49.435]  In fact, you probably get off on the fact that you're this tiny minority.
[00:26:49.455 --> 00:26:52.377]  You're the only ones that understand what it takes to be American.
[00:26:52.937 --> 00:26:53.557]  American?
[00:26:54.835 --> 00:27:02.159]  The people running our country have bankrupted our dollar, bankrupted our governments by design.
[00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:04.061]  They're dismantling the country.
[00:27:04.101 --> 00:27:06.262]  They've brought us into the North American Union.
[00:27:07.423 --> 00:27:09.084]  Do you think the war is any different?
[00:27:09.184 --> 00:27:16.988]  It is a direct assault on our good name, a direct assault on the dollar, a direct assault on the flower of our youth.
[00:27:20.030 --> 00:27:20.951]  Still, you don't care.
[00:27:21.271 --> 00:27:22.832]  You like propaganda simple.
[00:27:23.425 --> 00:27:24.046]  You're good.
[00:27:24.166 --> 00:27:25.807]  Stick a plastic flag on your car.
[00:27:26.247 --> 00:27:26.968]  Feel good.
[00:27:27.208 --> 00:27:28.289]  And just go into the night.
[00:27:30.231 --> 00:27:47.745]  Meanwhile, there is a growing group of Americans who are true warriors who are here defending the republic in its last minutes of light as night falls and as the true assault builds up inside and outside our walls.
[00:27:48.806 --> 00:27:51.128]  And I will repeat, I am here for
[00:27:52.825 --> 00:28:12.377]  Yelling as loud as I can from my rooftop, from my hilltop, that the enemy is at the gates and within the gates, and the enemy within the gates, the Council on Foreign Relations, the Republican and Democratic parties, are doing everything they can to lower that drawbridge to let the even larger force in.
[00:28:13.658 --> 00:28:21.603]  And I am sitting here trying to grab and stab and bayonet neocons in the Infowar off of the levers...
[00:28:23.806 --> 00:28:32.051]  As they do everything they can, just screaming with hatred right now, everything they can, tooth and nail, to lower that drawbridge and open those gates.
[00:28:33.592 --> 00:28:38.894]  And they're screaming that we're traitors, telling the undecided in the crowd, Help us!
[00:28:38.934 --> 00:28:40.375]  Help us open the drawbridge!
[00:28:40.415 --> 00:28:41.876]  We're going to let friends in!
[00:28:41.896 --> 00:28:52.342]  I have the clips here, when we've written articles about it, where there have been calls for Matt Damon to be arrested.
[00:28:53.382 --> 00:28:58.585]  There have been calls for Keith Oberman to be arrested and put in concentration camps.
[00:28:59.106 --> 00:29:06.711]  The neocons now in unison for Michael Savage to Rush Limbaugh to Fox News to Michael Gallagher to Laura Ingram.
[00:29:07.111 --> 00:29:10.933]  They're now openly calling us American Al-Qaeda and saying we all need to be arrested.
[00:29:14.295 --> 00:29:19.819]  I've had old friends who I've protested with going back 10 years ago
[00:29:25.510 --> 00:29:28.651]  Walk up to me and tell me that I need to be arrested.
[00:29:31.553 --> 00:29:33.674]  Because we're trying to stop them from opening the gates.
[00:29:37.455 --> 00:29:41.897]  So, we're going to come back and go to David, Bill, and many others that are patiently holding.
[00:29:41.917 --> 00:29:46.919]  And we'll continue to try to man the gates here.
[00:29:51.682 --> 00:29:52.702]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.102 --> 00:29:54.603]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.598 --> 00:29:58.360]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.022 --> 00:30:02.602]  Hello, friends.
[00:30:02.682 --> 00:30:04.363]  Alex Jones here with an important question.
[00:30:04.603 --> 00:30:06.624]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[00:30:06.784 --> 00:30:13.908]  I mean, real hard to find all-natural pure soap that contains no dyes, perfumes, deodorants, detergents, or other dangerous toxins.
[00:30:14.108 --> 00:30:22.693]  The Calvin Pure Soap Company, for the past 57 years, has been making triple-concentrated pure soaps exclusively for healthcare professionals and hospitals.
[00:30:23.013 --> 00:30:27.699]  Now for the first time, Calvin Pure Soap is available factory direct to you and your family.

[00:30:50.003 --> 00:30:52.385]  Try Pure Soap once and I'll guarantee you'll never use anything else.
[00:31:01.832 --> 00:31:05.814]  I found this company online, and they have this really unique variety of salt wellness products.
[00:31:06.034 --> 00:31:09.597]  I read some of the articles and ended up ordering this beautiful salt lamp.
[00:31:09.857 --> 00:31:13.939]  According to the company, they said that the salt crystal lamps gently purify indoor air.
[00:31:14.219 --> 00:31:15.160]  I was so amazed.
[00:31:15.400 --> 00:31:18.241]  I put it in the baby's room, and it made a perfect nightlight.
[00:31:18.442 --> 00:31:20.323]  Both my husband and I could tell the difference.
[00:31:20.703 --> 00:31:25.886]  SolelyWellness.com is a unique company that offers salt wellness products from around the world.
[00:31:26.366 --> 00:31:32.270]  So, I went back to the site and ordered their Soleil Simple Natural Cleaning Products, also made with Himalayan salt.
[00:31:32.551 --> 00:31:34.272]  I figured it would clean really well.
[00:31:34.532 --> 00:31:37.714]  The natural cleaning products worked wonderfully and there was no scent.
[00:31:37.895 --> 00:31:41.797]  This company has so many products my whole family can enjoy and feel better with.
[00:31:42.058 --> 00:31:43.579]  Plus, the service was great.
[00:31:43.879 --> 00:31:48.382]  If you're interested in natural, homeopathic, time-tested remedies, visit SoleilWellness.com.
[00:31:48.402 --> 00:31:48.663]  That's
[00:31:50.483 --> 00:31:52.064]  We're good to go.
[00:32:13.783 --> 00:32:14.424]  We're good to go.
[00:32:28.780 --> 00:32:29.120]  We're good to go.
[00:32:29.140 --> 00:32:29.640]  We're good to go.
[00:33:10.006 --> 00:33:27.893]  We know that this war was designed to make hundreds of billions of dollars a year for the defense contractors on top of what they were making
[00:33:40.114 --> 00:33:48.141]  In a black hole, no-bid contract, nightmare land, we know it was designed to make the world hate us.
[00:33:48.241 --> 00:33:53.946]  We know it was designed to break up Iraq and hurt those people and commit genocide against them.
[00:33:54.186 --> 00:33:55.828]  The stated plan!
[00:33:57.989 --> 00:34:06.757]  We know it was about destabilizing the entire region to have widening, even worse, conflicts in the future.
[00:34:08.283 --> 00:34:13.465]  We know the American people, close to 80% are against it.
[00:34:14.726 --> 00:34:15.606]  But you watch.
[00:34:15.746 --> 00:34:20.088]  We'll be there in two years, in five years, in ten years, in twenty years.
[00:34:22.249 --> 00:34:26.631]  The New World Order doesn't like a war where we go in there with a line of tanks and take over the enemy.
[00:34:29.036 --> 00:34:32.657]  Just take over the government and set up a central bank and then get the resources.
[00:34:32.917 --> 00:34:34.658]  That makes a fraction of the money.
[00:34:35.078 --> 00:34:39.540]  That gets a fraction of the control that just keeping a perpetual war does.
[00:34:40.220 --> 00:34:49.424]  And the people that say you support the troops by going along with this plan, a killing field, it's shameful.
[00:34:50.804 --> 00:34:53.205]  It is absolutely 110% shameful.
[00:34:59.511 --> 00:35:02.094]  But listen, the people out there that support the war shouldn't worry.
[00:35:02.114 --> 00:35:03.415]  You're going to get what you want.
[00:35:04.736 --> 00:35:05.077]  Okay?
[00:35:05.097 --> 00:35:06.939]  You're going to get your heart's desire.
[00:35:07.899 --> 00:35:11.003]  A lot of you at a sick subconscious level want to bury your kids.
[00:35:11.283 --> 00:35:14.086]  You want to be out there with the 21-gun salute and a bugler.
[00:35:18.573 --> 00:35:29.857]  You want to stick stickers all over your car and tell everybody how you're in the military and how your children are in it and you're big warriors and man, you're over there fighting them dirty Arabs.
[00:35:38.439 --> 00:35:39.019]  So fine.
[00:35:39.900 --> 00:35:43.861]  I mean, just do not think for a minute that you're going to draft any of my family.
[00:35:44.581 --> 00:35:47.522]  Do not think for a minute I'm going to go breathe your uranium.
[00:35:48.522 --> 00:35:52.145]  Do not think for a minute that I'm going to be part of this in any way.
[00:35:53.126 --> 00:36:03.435]  And for the rest of the American people who aren't for all of this and who have seen at least enough to know it's wrong, I salute you, I thank you for being sane.
[00:36:07.079 --> 00:36:09.681]  And now we have to recognize what we're living in.
[00:36:10.601 --> 00:36:15.585]  On every issue, the government is doing the opposite of what the American people want.
[00:36:15.605 --> 00:36:20.889]  They have national polls on the New Freedom Initiative, even with the polls spinning it to make it look good.
[00:36:21.170 --> 00:36:23.351]  Forced psychological testing, forced drugging.
[00:36:25.493 --> 00:36:30.737]  For everyone ages 4 to 18, 90 plus percent in major polls were against it.
[00:36:30.757 --> 00:36:40.005]  90 plus percent in major polls, they ran the gamut, but they were all above 90, were against the REAL ID Act
[00:36:40.660 --> 00:36:41.401]  Of last year.
[00:36:44.903 --> 00:36:49.046]  That the illegal aliens, by the way, now reported by the Associated Press, are exempt.
[00:36:49.066 --> 00:36:50.667]  I already knew it was exempt.
[00:36:50.707 --> 00:36:56.011]  I've been told by people in industry and in the DPS, state police, but now it's in the news.
[00:36:56.051 --> 00:36:56.571]  They're exempt.
[00:36:56.591 --> 00:37:00.274]  90 plus percent are against that.
[00:37:01.235 --> 00:37:02.295]  Government doesn't care.
[00:37:02.696 --> 00:37:05.158]  Because our government is bought and paid for.
[00:37:05.198 --> 00:37:08.460]  And when I say that, I mean it's really bought and paid for.
[00:37:09.637 --> 00:37:11.859]  And so let them act like dictators.
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:13.421]  Let them be dictators.
[00:37:14.282 --> 00:37:17.726]  Like Patrick Henry said, my friends, the war has already begun.
[00:37:18.086 --> 00:37:19.527]  Why stand we here idle?
[00:37:23.532 --> 00:37:25.674]  So it had to get bad before it was going to get better.
[00:37:27.401 --> 00:37:40.850]  And so now we have to set about showing the American people how their will, but not just their will, what is constitutional is being ignored at every step of the way.
[00:37:42.651 --> 00:37:48.555]  The Democrats put out all that lip service about ending the war and getting our troops out of there.
[00:37:48.595 --> 00:37:50.696]  That's because they knew the American people wanted that.
[00:37:50.776 --> 00:37:52.317]  They won by a landslide.
[00:37:52.337 --> 00:37:56.160]  It looks like election fraud kept it from being a total takeover.
[00:37:58.362 --> 00:37:59.482]  A lot of evidence of fraud.
[00:38:01.623 --> 00:38:06.144]  And now they come in and it turns out they're even more hawkish than Bush.
[00:38:08.565 --> 00:38:11.745]  It's like they want to do attack Serbia.
[00:38:12.085 --> 00:38:13.406]  That's what's so amazing about this.
[00:38:13.526 --> 00:38:18.327]  Our government, the criminals that run it, hire Al-CIA to hire Al-Qaeda.
[00:38:18.667 --> 00:38:21.228]  These are a Senate Republican report, 1999.
[00:38:24.549 --> 00:38:25.769]  To attack the Serbs.
[00:38:26.866 --> 00:38:30.188]  I mean, we're talking Al-Qaeda blowing up school buses, attacking schools.
[00:38:30.809 --> 00:38:32.350]  They knew exactly what they were doing.
[00:38:32.490 --> 00:38:33.911]  Go after the young.
[00:38:34.231 --> 00:38:36.953]  That will always get people hopping mad.
[00:38:37.754 --> 00:38:39.595]  The Serbs pour into their south.
[00:38:40.876 --> 00:38:43.738]  They drive out the KLA, and here comes the U.S.
[00:38:43.778 --> 00:38:45.599]  of A. Always on the wrong side.
[00:38:45.999 --> 00:38:47.120]  Always doing evil.
[00:38:47.580 --> 00:38:48.781]  Always supporting evil.
[00:38:49.562 --> 00:38:51.143]  Always helping the New World Order.
[00:38:57.387 --> 00:38:59.088]  Always trying to break up countries.
[00:39:03.432 --> 00:39:04.032]  It's amazing.
[00:39:06.794 --> 00:39:07.554]  It's unbelievable.
[00:39:08.455 --> 00:39:10.457]  All right, I said I'd go to your calls, and I'm going to do that now.
[00:39:11.497 --> 00:39:12.238]  It's just AP.
[00:39:12.278 --> 00:39:14.680]  Pentagon wants $99.7 billion.
[00:39:17.201 --> 00:39:24.587]  The Pentagon wants the White House to seek an additional $99.7 billion to fund the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, according to information provided by the APB.
[00:39:25.242 --> 00:39:33.691]  The military's request, if embraced by the President and approved by Congress, would boost this year's budget for those wars to about $170 billion.
[00:39:33.711 --> 00:39:38.636]  That is above the $600-plus billion in the 2007 John Warner Defense Authorization Act.
[00:39:47.896 --> 00:39:52.917]  Military planners assembled the proposal at a time when Bush is developing new strategies for Iraq.
[00:39:53.197 --> 00:39:54.418]  They're the exact same strategies.
[00:39:54.438 --> 00:40:00.679]  Again, they have the Iraq study group appointed by him, run by his daddy's people, comes out and proposes the exact same stuff.
[00:40:00.959 --> 00:40:06.681]  Bush comes out and attacks it to fool the left in this country to think if Bush is attacking it, it must be a good plan.
[00:40:06.901 --> 00:40:08.821]  Oh, please don't throw me in the briar patch.
[00:40:10.922 --> 00:40:13.382]  When that's exactly where Brer Rabbit wants to be thrown away.
[00:40:13.582 --> 00:40:14.703]  You ever heard the children's tale?
[00:40:15.663 --> 00:40:16.083]  The, uh...
[00:40:17.395 --> 00:40:17.655]  What is it?
[00:40:17.675 --> 00:40:19.776]  The farmer catches Briar Rabbit by the ears.
[00:40:19.816 --> 00:40:20.496]  He's going to eat him.
[00:40:20.916 --> 00:40:21.696]  He's going to stew him.
[00:40:22.036 --> 00:40:24.697]  And Briar Rabbit says, Please don't throw me in the briar patch.
[00:40:25.777 --> 00:40:34.119]  And the stupid antagonist throws him in the briar patch where he lives, where he can't be caught.
[00:40:36.820 --> 00:40:37.580]  Bush comes out.
[00:40:37.640 --> 00:40:39.240]  Please don't boost the troops.
[00:40:39.340 --> 00:40:40.761]  Please don't keep us there.
[00:40:41.241 --> 00:40:46.182]  Please don't put it into a non-politicized process so it can go on forever.
[00:40:48.707 --> 00:40:49.127]  Oh, yeah?
[00:40:49.167 --> 00:40:50.248]  We'll show you, Bush!
[00:40:52.430 --> 00:40:57.373]  Now, Democrats are swaggering around, going, Well, we've taken control of the process.
[00:40:57.433 --> 00:40:59.114]  Now we're doing what's right in the war.
[00:40:59.174 --> 00:41:00.595]  Well, now the war's okay.
[00:41:05.418 --> 00:41:08.520]  Overall, the war in Iraq has cost about $350 billion.
[00:41:09.061 --> 00:41:14.604]  Combined with the conflict in Afghanistan and operations against terrorism elsewhere, the cost has topped $500 billion.
[00:41:14.644 --> 00:41:15.625]  It's actually much higher than that.
[00:41:15.945 --> 00:41:18.227]  According to the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service...
[00:41:18.760 --> 00:41:27.403]  The additional funds have approved would push this year's cost of the war in Iraq to about $50 billion over last year's record of $70-plus billion.
[00:41:29.644 --> 00:41:37.926]  A description of the Pentagon request was provided by a person familiar with the proposal who asked for an anonymity because the person was unauthorized to release the information.
[00:41:38.426 --> 00:41:45.909]  So we've got that right there, and we have top Democrats coming out
[00:41:46.627 --> 00:41:48.428]  Who want to increase trip levels.
[00:41:49.509 --> 00:41:55.193]  And that means trips that have been there three and a half years will start their fifth tours in about six months.
[00:41:55.793 --> 00:42:00.496]  Imagine, you sign up for three years, you're going to be there four years later.
[00:42:00.857 --> 00:42:02.618]  In World War II, one tour.
[00:42:02.898 --> 00:42:04.219]  In Vietnam, one tour.
[00:42:04.799 --> 00:42:06.240]  In Korea, one tour.
[00:42:06.480 --> 00:42:09.102]  And still, people wear basket cases in most cases.
[00:42:09.122 --> 00:42:14.846]  Doesn't matter how macho you are, your glands just can't supply the juice that long.
[00:42:19.009 --> 00:42:24.870]  I mean, this is like driving tires past the time they're bald.
[00:42:27.131 --> 00:42:27.671]  So what?
[00:42:27.731 --> 00:42:28.771]  That's how you support them.
[00:42:28.971 --> 00:42:30.411]  You'll ruin their lives.
[00:42:31.272 --> 00:42:31.572]  Okay.
[00:42:32.092 --> 00:42:33.712]  David in Louisiana, you're on the air.
[00:42:33.752 --> 00:42:34.152]  Go ahead.
[00:42:34.172 --> 00:42:34.892]  Hey, Alex.
[00:42:34.933 --> 00:42:35.793]  How are you doing today?
[00:42:36.473 --> 00:42:37.433]  I guess not too good.
[00:42:37.453 --> 00:42:40.054]  Not too good from the way you're talking it here, it sounds.
[00:42:40.134 --> 00:42:44.695]  But I wanted to open the call with a story about how they might hide things in plain sight.
[00:42:45.464 --> 00:42:52.127]  I was watching a movie about two cops that work in Miami in the vice unit, and there was an interesting thing that I saw.
[00:42:52.187 --> 00:42:57.310]  I saw the character who played the big bad drug dealer sitting on his bed, and guess what he was watching?
[00:42:57.590 --> 00:42:58.450]  The stock market.
[00:42:58.470 --> 00:43:01.011]  So that kind of tells me that he has interest in that avenue.
[00:43:01.752 --> 00:43:13.057]  And also, another frame of the show fixated on this large eyeball that stayed there for about five seconds and kind of drifted into the street-level overview.
[00:43:13.678 --> 00:43:16.659]  No point to the movie of that being any kind of relevant.
[00:43:16.679 --> 00:43:24.420]  They just had a big ol' eyeball on the front of the TV just looking at you for five or eight seconds and I was just... I found that kind of interesting.
[00:43:25.441 --> 00:43:26.781]  So anyway, I'll go on to a question.
[00:43:27.761 --> 00:43:39.384]  With all the corruption, with all the knowledge of corruption, with all this long-term, dirty dealing, decade of decadence, when will these people be held accountable in serious measures?
[00:43:40.211 --> 00:43:41.652]  Well, this is how corruption works.
[00:43:42.192 --> 00:43:43.153]  And the corrupt know this.
[00:43:43.253 --> 00:43:47.356]  Either they go for broke and take everything over, or they finally collapse and lose.
[00:43:47.676 --> 00:43:48.877]  So it's built in.
[00:43:49.017 --> 00:43:51.879]  It's incentivized for them to bring in total tyranny.
[00:43:52.420 --> 00:43:55.522]  And so it may just continue and continue and get worse and worse and worse.
[00:43:55.982 --> 00:43:59.344]  And they're changing all the laws to take your property, to take your guns.
[00:44:00.045 --> 00:44:01.786]  They'll twist it and say it's conservative.
[00:44:02.046 --> 00:44:04.868]  They're now saying it's for security to have a North American union.
[00:44:05.148 --> 00:44:07.190]  So all the neocons are saying we must have it.
[00:44:07.230 --> 00:44:10.492]  You're American Al-Qaeda if you aren't for it.
[00:44:10.512 --> 00:44:11.673]  We've got to take your kids.
[00:44:11.693 --> 00:44:12.714]  It's for America.
[00:44:13.014 --> 00:44:14.715]  We've got to raid your house.
[00:44:14.755 --> 00:44:15.616]  It's for America.
[00:44:15.856 --> 00:44:18.478]  We've got to force vaccines on you to fight Al-Qaeda.
[00:44:18.778 --> 00:44:20.739]  Just let us run your life.
[00:44:20.799 --> 00:44:21.600]  It's for your own good.
[00:44:22.105 --> 00:44:22.885]  Here's the reality.
[00:44:22.925 --> 00:44:30.089]  You and many others are standing together, shoulder by shoulder, with the members proving it, that we are trying to expose these people.
[00:44:30.509 --> 00:44:31.370]  People are coming out.
[00:44:31.490 --> 00:44:32.250]  People are talking.
[00:44:32.270 --> 00:44:33.151]  They're not shutting up.
[00:44:33.171 --> 00:44:35.852]  They're not afraid to be an American and stand up for this country.
[00:44:36.514 --> 00:44:40.539]  That, you know, I believe still is the greatest country in the world.
[00:44:53.252 --> 00:44:54.052]  That will stand up.
[00:44:54.132 --> 00:45:01.173]  So they're busy getting the 20% ready to physically fight with the police and military against the American people.
[00:45:01.193 --> 00:45:03.474]  That's why there's all the talk of FEMA camps are good.
[00:45:03.754 --> 00:45:05.054]  We should put Americans in them.
[00:45:05.354 --> 00:45:06.774]  Yeah, let's arrest everybody.
[00:45:06.994 --> 00:45:16.016]  Because the criminal tiny 1% and their 20% moron minions are going to try to physically make us be their slaves.
[00:45:16.596 --> 00:45:19.377]  And I'm doing everything I can to avert that physical violence.
[00:45:19.777 --> 00:45:21.157]  But they're chomping for a fight.
[00:45:21.277 --> 00:45:21.797]  They want it.
[00:45:22.313 --> 00:45:27.316]  Your show is called Info Wars and that's the greatest title you can possibly put on it because it is an information war.
[00:45:27.836 --> 00:45:37.141]  I was talking to friends and family about Skull and Bones and how our president and John Carrier, Skull and Bones, and there's many people inside the high elite societies that are coming from this
[00:45:37.739 --> 00:45:38.240]  We're good to go.
[00:45:54.517 --> 00:45:55.838]  Lifestyles of these people.
[00:45:56.138 --> 00:45:59.461]  And when I tell them this, they're looking at me like, man, I did not know that.
[00:45:59.761 --> 00:46:00.722]  I said, go look it up.
[00:46:00.782 --> 00:46:01.943]  It's in the encyclopedia.
[00:46:02.003 --> 00:46:07.528]  All these people on Fox News who don't even address the situation, it's in the encyclopedia for these people to read.
[00:46:07.568 --> 00:46:10.170]  But they blatantly just overlook it and call us crazy.
[00:46:10.470 --> 00:46:11.090]  Well, guess what?
[00:46:11.370 --> 00:46:12.631]  It's not going to stay that way forever.
[00:46:12.671 --> 00:46:13.692]  People are going to believe.
[00:46:14.092 --> 00:46:17.253]  People are going to look at the facts and go with it and run with it.
[00:46:17.353 --> 00:46:17.774]  That's right.
[00:46:17.794 --> 00:46:18.714]  I appreciate your call.
[00:46:19.374 --> 00:46:25.097]  International Russian Television is here right now videotaping the show, our operations.
[00:46:25.277 --> 00:46:27.899]  They're doing a show on Bohemian Grove.
[00:46:28.579 --> 00:46:34.482]  I've had Dutch and Japanese TV contact me this week about Bohemian Grove.
[00:46:35.822 --> 00:46:37.163]  So, yes, the word is getting out.
[00:46:37.243 --> 00:46:38.604]  Bill in Tennessee, you're on the air.
[00:46:38.644 --> 00:46:39.024]  Go ahead.
[00:46:40.021 --> 00:46:44.062]  When am I going to be getting my national ID card in the mail?
[00:46:44.082 --> 00:46:48.944]  Okay, is this Troy?
[00:46:49.024 --> 00:46:50.324]  My name's Bull!
[00:46:51.944 --> 00:46:52.285]  Pardon me?
[00:46:52.305 --> 00:46:53.925]  My name's Bull!
[00:46:55.665 --> 00:46:56.706]  It sounds like Troy.
[00:46:56.766 --> 00:46:57.466]  Bull!
[00:46:59.807 --> 00:47:00.867]  Seriously, caller.
[00:47:01.127 --> 00:47:04.348]  When am I going to be getting my national ID card?
[00:47:05.617 --> 00:47:06.718]  So I get your joke.
[00:47:07.318 --> 00:47:09.338]  You think it's going to say National ID card on it?
[00:47:09.418 --> 00:47:10.199]  Yeah!
[00:47:12.740 --> 00:47:13.060]  Okay.
[00:47:14.220 --> 00:47:22.503]  Starting in 1993 on a pilot test under a Bill Clinton executive order, they began standardizing IDs around the country.
[00:47:22.663 --> 00:47:24.464]  When am I going to get mine?
[00:47:25.184 --> 00:47:26.684]  You have one right now in your wallet.
[00:47:26.704 --> 00:47:31.746]  If you have a Tennessee driver's license, it has been federally standardized.
[00:47:33.407 --> 00:47:33.867]  Okay.
[00:47:35.603 --> 00:47:36.624]  Alright, thank you for the call.
[00:47:36.804 --> 00:47:37.264]  Very funny.
[00:47:38.685 --> 00:47:39.706]  That's another thing they do.
[00:47:39.746 --> 00:47:46.831]  I've been on national talk shows, local talk shows, and the host will say, what's this on your website about national ID cards?
[00:47:47.732 --> 00:47:49.193]  There's no national ID card.
[00:47:49.233 --> 00:47:50.674]  I've got a state driver's license.
[00:47:50.694 --> 00:47:52.275]  I've got a California driver's license.
[00:47:53.496 --> 00:47:55.598]  And I say, no, it's a federal ID card.
[00:47:55.938 --> 00:47:57.499]  No, it says California.
[00:47:57.599 --> 00:47:59.701]  Now, they know full well it's a national ID.
[00:48:00.161 --> 00:48:01.902]  Their job is to lie to their listeners.
[00:48:03.343 --> 00:48:03.964]  Let me say it again.
[00:48:04.927 --> 00:48:14.230]  Starting in 93 with Texas as the beta test, they began taking a digital face scan photo and a biometric thumbprint.
[00:48:16.331 --> 00:48:19.692]  By 95, a majority of states had it.
[00:48:19.972 --> 00:48:30.315]  By 2000, all but two states were taking biometrics and had already federally standardized with a barcode, a magnetic strip.
[00:48:32.347 --> 00:48:35.049]  So what they do is they put it in place, then they make a law.
[00:48:35.649 --> 00:48:39.872]  Like Bush was already spying on American citizens, then he gets in trouble and tries to pass a law.
[00:48:40.152 --> 00:48:44.475]  Or he's already grabbing citizens and sending them to torture camps, then he passes the law, H.R.
[00:48:44.495 --> 00:48:46.636]  6166, see, once he gets in trouble.
[00:48:47.377 --> 00:48:53.620]  So, through highway funds and through funded and unfunded mandates, they have the states adopt it.
[00:48:53.680 --> 00:48:54.561]  Texas was first.
[00:48:57.683 --> 00:49:00.625]  California and Texas and New York and a few others are the bellwethers.
[00:49:03.115 --> 00:49:04.336]  And so they put it in place.
[00:49:05.457 --> 00:49:18.747]  Then in 2005, they passed the Real ID Act that under federal law, all states had to adopt federal standards and be integrated into the database.
[00:49:19.647 --> 00:49:21.669]  Well, most states had already done it.
[00:49:25.001 --> 00:49:28.922]  But just like, here's an example, they have a regional Sports Illustrated.
[00:49:29.243 --> 00:49:31.283]  Well, they've got like ten different brands of Sports Illustrated.
[00:49:31.663 --> 00:49:37.265]  Basically the same articles inside, you're buying it from Sports Illustrated, but it has your regional look, your regional teams.
[00:49:38.326 --> 00:49:39.366]  And so you think it's local.
[00:49:40.847 --> 00:49:42.907]  Alright, well it's the same thing with a national ID card.
[00:49:43.388 --> 00:49:46.229]  And they'll argue with you all day, no, no, this is a driver's license.
[00:49:46.649 --> 00:49:47.269]  No, it's not!
[00:49:47.389 --> 00:49:49.270]  Federal law, it's a national ID card.
[00:49:49.930 --> 00:49:52.471]  Finally the media is announcing it, what, a few weeks ago we played a
[00:49:54.231 --> 00:49:55.191]  10 years after I warned you.
[00:49:55.211 --> 00:49:55.391]  10 years.
[00:50:25.293 --> 00:50:39.438]  Ten years ago, I went into the state driver's license facility in North Austin with over 100 great Americans, and I laid out and gave a speech and said everything that was going to happen and held up the executive order and read it.
[00:50:41.538 --> 00:50:43.119]  It's in America Destroyed by Design.
[00:50:43.179 --> 00:50:45.160]  Now available on DVD, I would add, finally.
[00:50:46.920 --> 00:50:47.680]  And now it's here.
[00:50:49.341 --> 00:50:50.001]  Now it's here.
[00:50:50.021 --> 00:50:52.302]  Okay?
[00:50:52.322 --> 00:50:52.522]  Okay?
[00:50:54.528 --> 00:50:56.909]  And they're going to give you a national sales tax now with that baby.
[00:50:57.469 --> 00:50:58.429]  Hope you enjoy it.
[00:50:58.449 --> 00:51:07.811]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[00:51:08.151 --> 00:51:10.072]  My new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:51:10.452 --> 00:51:18.074]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:18.812 --> 00:51:25.856]  TerrorStorm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:51:26.256 --> 00:51:37.662]  TerrorStorm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:51:37.982 --> 00:51:41.484]  TerrorStorm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:51:41.964 --> 00:51:43.845]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:51:44.225 --> 00:51:48.047]  TerrorStorm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:52:01.252 --> 00:52:09.514]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking a hot shower than when you drink the water?
[00:52:09.774 --> 00:52:14.115]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[00:52:14.415 --> 00:52:23.337]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[00:52:23.537 --> 00:52:27.158]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[00:52:27.458 --> 00:52:32.487]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[00:52:32.787 --> 00:52:39.479]  Hospitals, restaurants and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria.
[00:52:39.986 --> 00:52:40.626]  What about you?

[00:53:55.326 --> 00:53:59.811]  HerbalHealer.com Celebrating 18 years of dedication.
[00:54:15.538 --> 00:54:18.359]  Yeah, that's what it comes down to.
[00:54:45.999 --> 00:54:47.900]  The government has its cannons pointed at you.
[00:54:47.940 --> 00:54:53.262]  The police are militarized, are arrogant, have been trained to be against us.
[00:54:54.302 --> 00:55:01.245]  The military's been trained to take our guns, to put us in camps, and now it isn't Alex Jones warning you about secret concentration camp programs.
[00:55:01.986 --> 00:55:10.349]  It's professors, it's talk show hosts, it's all these people can talk about, and they lick their lips and go, one more attack and you're all going in camps.
[00:55:11.098 --> 00:55:25.171]  Here's a local newscast, and when I saw this newscast, I knew of course it would be on every other ABC newscast in the country, because they produce these nationally, then send the video down locally, so it gives it the illusion of local, but it's the same message.
[00:55:25.691 --> 00:55:27.393]  You must all take vaccines, it's the law.
[00:55:27.773 --> 00:55:29.795]  There is no more mercury in the vaccines, it's the law.
[00:55:30.876 --> 00:55:32.698]  The mercury's in the vaccines, it's good for you.
[00:55:34.118 --> 00:55:35.659]  You know, the national ID card is here.
[00:55:35.719 --> 00:55:36.599]  It's good for you.
[00:55:37.419 --> 00:55:39.440]  It's this unified message.
[00:55:39.480 --> 00:55:44.141]  Here it is, telling you about your new national ID card right here in Texas.
[00:55:44.501 --> 00:55:50.803]  Tonight, we're tracking massive changes that are coming for anyone with a Texas driver's license or state ID.
[00:55:51.003 --> 00:55:55.584]  If you thought you could avoid the lines of the DMV and renew by mail or perhaps the Internet...
[00:55:56.204 --> 00:55:56.784]  Think again.
[00:55:56.924 --> 00:56:03.666]  We've been doing some checking on a new federal law, and 11ist reporter Nancy Holland has discovered it'll cost you time and money.
[00:56:04.886 --> 00:56:07.386]  Twenty-four, twenty-five.
[00:56:07.426 --> 00:56:10.567]  Five million people a year get driver's licenses in Texas.
[00:56:10.707 --> 00:56:11.427]  Twenty-six.
[00:56:11.547 --> 00:56:15.908]  But even after a holiday, the line is nothing compared to what people here expect.
[00:56:16.208 --> 00:56:16.989]  Twenty-seven.
[00:56:17.049 --> 00:56:18.969]  No one expects it around the building.
[00:56:20.416 --> 00:56:21.317]  I'm not going to play all of it.
[00:56:21.377 --> 00:56:23.378]  We posted it on Infowars.com a few weeks ago.
[00:56:23.438 --> 00:56:27.240]  But notice, they don't talk about the story like, do you want a national ID card?
[00:56:49.830 --> 00:56:57.195]  It's just, oh, it's going to cause big lines, but don't worry, the feds are being told by the state to give them some money.
[00:56:58.256 --> 00:57:00.837]  Oh, it isn't face-scanning cameras going up everywhere.
[00:57:00.957 --> 00:57:01.458]  Bad!
[00:57:02.278 --> 00:57:03.979]  Tracking everything you do and where you go.
[00:57:04.079 --> 00:57:06.221]  It's that, oh, sometimes they give false IDs.
[00:57:06.481 --> 00:57:08.382]  We need to fix that, and then it's okay.
[00:57:09.023 --> 00:57:10.824]  You see, to give the illusion of...
[00:57:11.812 --> 00:57:12.693]  We're good to go.
[00:57:40.655 --> 00:57:48.059]  Yeah, a lot of your top editors are CIA, Defense Intelligence, National Security Agency, or they're part of other big private think tanks that get government funding.
[00:57:49.640 --> 00:57:50.240]  And they're there.
[00:57:50.300 --> 00:57:50.980]  They're on a team.
[00:57:51.020 --> 00:57:52.361]  They get all the sweetheart deals.
[00:57:52.401 --> 00:57:53.922]  They get all the great investment tips.
[00:57:53.962 --> 00:57:55.082]  They get to do whatever they want.
[00:57:56.663 --> 00:58:02.126]  They get to be above the law, like Sandy Berger, caught red-handed stealing ultra-secret documents and he doesn't get in trouble.
[00:58:03.406 --> 00:58:05.728]  But you, you're going to be kept in line.
[00:58:05.768 --> 00:58:07.088]  You're going to be told how to jump.
[00:58:07.408 --> 00:58:08.389]  Before I end this hour...
[00:58:09.557 --> 00:58:15.578]  I want to encourage everybody to get my original seven films that I've never gotten on DVD to get them.
[00:58:15.598 --> 00:58:16.338]  They're now available.
[00:58:17.579 --> 00:58:20.999]  All three of my Police State films on three DVDs in a box set, $34.95.
[00:58:21.319 --> 00:58:23.360]  That's almost half off.
[00:58:23.440 --> 00:58:24.420]  That's available right now.
[00:58:24.760 --> 00:58:30.501]  America Destroyed by Design, The Masters of Terror, The Matrix of Evil, The Comprehensive Angle of Financial Reports Exposed.
[00:58:30.941 --> 00:58:32.402]  All available at InfoWars.com.
[00:58:34.767 --> 00:58:38.188]  Or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[00:58:38.428 --> 00:58:39.468]  Check an hour straight ahead.

[00:58:45.929 --> 00:58:46.349]  Big Brother.
[00:58:46.509 --> 00:58:47.130]  Mainstream media.
[00:58:47.290 --> 00:58:52.911]  Government cover-ups.
[00:58:53.331 --> 00:58:55.851]  You want answers?
[00:59:03.855 --> 00:59:04.756]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.417 --> 00:59:09.140]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.601 --> 00:59:13.745]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:17.989 --> 00:59:28.199]  Just in the news today, Maryland five-year-old accused of pinching a teacher's behind, being charged with sex crimes.
[00:59:29.227 --> 00:59:31.569]  Four-year-old accused of improperly touching teacher.
[00:59:31.589 --> 00:59:33.891]  It says for hugging the teacher.
[00:59:35.893 --> 00:59:37.735]  Draw a picture of a gun in art class.
[00:59:37.755 --> 00:59:38.636]  You get arrested.
[00:59:39.336 --> 00:59:47.544]  It's all about taking behavior that is innocent and criminalizing instead of someone getting in trouble for hugging or something like that.
[00:59:48.265 --> 00:59:50.747]  Now it's about maximum enforcement.
[00:59:51.283 --> 00:59:51.883]  I think we're good to go.
[00:59:51.903 --> 00:59:52.424]  I think we're good to go.
[01:00:13.757 --> 01:00:19.019]  But I've always been into the Aztecs and what happened down there and the Mayan culture overall.
[01:00:19.079 --> 01:00:20.640]  So that's, you know, you've heard me talk a lot about it.
[01:00:20.660 --> 01:00:22.701]  That's why we're covering this on a few shows.
[01:00:23.962 --> 01:00:28.904]  Also, Freightliner plans Mexico factory despite layoffs elsewhere.
[01:00:28.924 --> 01:00:40.229]  In the U.S., Damler Chrysler's Portland-based Freightliner unit will build a $300 million truck plant in Mexico but then lay off 4,000 North American employees.
[01:00:41.696 --> 01:00:45.198]  Yes, Alex, this is Mark, and I'd like to go ahead and let you know this is Mark Clayton.
[01:00:45.218 --> 01:00:50.781]  For anybody out there who thinks that you should be ashamed to associate with Alex Jones, I am proud to be on this show.
[01:01:09.753 --> 01:01:13.036]  And proud to have gotten through today to be able to talk to you, Alex.
[01:01:13.296 --> 01:01:21.263]  And I want to thank you personally for one of the most important pieces of journalism in exposing the Bohemian Grove in American history.
[01:01:22.904 --> 01:01:37.016]  I worked with the late William J. Gill in our last small and ignominious push to try to halt our march into a complete and total free trade empire, which we are now in and there is no retreat from.
[01:01:38.877 --> 01:01:48.739]  He personally knew people for years who went to the Bohemian Grove, and he never knew anything about this Moloch idol worship.
[01:01:49.479 --> 01:01:53.660]  I told him about that, and I brought your video in, and I showed that to him.
[01:01:54.120 --> 01:02:07.363]  Incidentally, just in case you're wondering, he's the man who is mainly behind influencing Pat Buchanan to abandon the neoconservative free trade ideology and then come out with his protectionist stance for his 1990 campaign.
[01:02:09.150 --> 01:02:12.132]  For his first presidential run.
[01:02:13.152 --> 01:02:23.336]  So, when I showed him your video, Alex, he said, now this is a man who had a who's who of the people he knew in American history.
[01:02:23.377 --> 01:02:29.379]  He had a whole stack of biographies, a whole bookcase full of biographies of people he knew.
[01:02:31.480 --> 01:02:38.043]  He said, when he saw that, he said, this would explain all of the insanity I've been dealing with for all these years.
[01:02:38.499 --> 01:02:52.665]  He personally worked for Richard Mellon Scaife, one of the financiers of the conservative movement of our lifetime, and Richard Mellon Scaife went out to the Bohemian Grove quite often, according to Bill Gill.
[01:02:53.145 --> 01:03:05.770]  Now, it's no small wonder that Bill Gill was not invited to the Bohemian Grove because Bill Gill is a patriot, and he would never sell out his country for a bunch of garbage, Moloch idol worship.
[01:03:07.532 --> 01:03:12.174]  Well, and it's not just the bizarre drunkenness and the sex and the Moloch stuff.
[01:03:12.535 --> 01:03:18.958]  It's also, we've gotten transcripts of the Lakeside Chats, which are all New World Order in nature, get rid of U.S.
[01:03:18.998 --> 01:03:21.199]  sovereignty, bring in one world government.
[01:03:22.680 --> 01:03:25.721]  Well, I really appreciate everything that you've done, Alex.
[01:03:26.261 --> 01:03:28.323]  I've started a website with my cousin.
[01:03:28.383 --> 01:03:30.724]  I've had to seriously... Fire the website out.
[01:03:30.744 --> 01:03:31.224]  We're out of time.
[01:03:31.984 --> 01:03:34.286]  Okay, it's governmentnews.org.
[01:03:35.006 --> 01:03:36.507]  Hey, that's a good website.
[01:03:36.547 --> 01:03:36.987]  Thank you.
[01:03:37.699 --> 01:03:38.741]  That's a good address name.
[01:03:38.802 --> 01:03:40.245]  Thank you, governmentnews.org.
[01:03:40.686 --> 01:03:42.209]  All right, I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:03:42.349 --> 01:03:44.514]  It's the GCN Radio Network.
[01:03:44.614 --> 01:03:47.380]  Straight back to your calls on the news on the other side.
[01:03:56.320 --> 01:03:59.482]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[01:03:59.822 --> 01:04:01.783]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[01:04:02.144 --> 01:04:09.809]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:04:10.489 --> 01:04:17.533]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:04:17.934 --> 01:04:24.838]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spies,
[01:04:25.230 --> 01:04:27.791]  Or by calling toll-free 1-888-253-3139 or watch it right now online at prisonplanet.tv
[01:04:52.819 --> 01:04:53.520]  Hello, folks.
[01:04:53.560 --> 01:05:00.404]  This is Alex Jones introducing you to the incredible Berkey Solar Charger, your source for free solar electricity.
[01:05:00.644 --> 01:05:07.769]  This portable system is the size of a book when folded and small enough to fit into a briefcase, handbag, or glove compartment.
[01:05:07.889 --> 01:05:19.437]  The Berkey Solar Charger has been designed to power the Berkey lights, LED lamps, as well as other applications such as mobile phones, radios, digital cameras, and PDAs when electricity is not available.
[01:05:19.817 --> 01:05:21.098]  Its multi-voltage capability
[01:05:21.178 --> 01:05:24.899]  Get the incredible Berkey Solar Charger for only $75 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:05:24.999 --> 01:05:26.460]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:05:26.480 --> 01:05:27.240]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[01:05:50.728 --> 01:05:51.509]  We're good to go.
[01:06:14.486 --> 01:06:18.848]  Our creditors are becoming increasingly concerned that the debt can never be repaid.
[01:06:19.008 --> 01:06:21.609]  Japan and China, two of the largest holders of U.S.
[01:06:21.649 --> 01:06:24.410]  debt, are looking to greatly reduce their exposure to dollars.
[01:06:24.870 --> 01:06:27.411]  In fact, China has privately hinted that a U.S.
[01:06:27.451 --> 01:06:31.713]  attack on Iran could result in China dumping massive amounts of U.S.
[01:06:31.753 --> 01:06:32.593]  Treasury bonds.
[01:06:32.853 --> 01:06:33.313]  We're good to go.
[01:06:57.777 --> 01:06:58.437]  Big Brother.
[01:06:59.097 --> 01:07:00.158]  Mainstream media.
[01:07:00.858 --> 01:07:01.998]  Government cover-ups.
[01:07:02.618 --> 01:07:03.438]  You want answers?
[01:07:04.198 --> 01:07:05.239]  Well, so does he.
[01:07:05.759 --> 01:07:09.719]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:09.940 --> 01:07:14.040]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:07:36.508 --> 01:07:38.108]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:07:38.508 --> 01:07:41.349]  Let's go ahead and go straight back to your phone calls.
[01:07:41.910 --> 01:07:44.071]  Let's talk to John in New York.
[01:07:44.171 --> 01:07:44.911]  John, you're on the air.
[01:07:44.971 --> 01:07:45.571]  Thanks for holding.
[01:07:45.591 --> 01:07:46.331]  Hi, Alex.
[01:07:46.351 --> 01:07:46.692]  How are you?
[01:07:47.012 --> 01:07:47.352]  Good, sir.
[01:07:47.652 --> 01:07:49.553]  I just wanted to say that I love you and that...
[01:07:51.205 --> 01:07:55.226]  You work harder than anybody else that I've ever seen, but I have three questions, quick questions.
[01:07:55.706 --> 01:08:02.747]  Number one, there's so much evidence covering 9-11 from every angle, exposing it as an inside job, and nothing's happening.
[01:08:03.067 --> 01:08:05.988]  Nobody's getting arrested, nobody's getting impeached, no jail.
[01:08:06.628 --> 01:08:09.969]  Number two, Bush just came out and said he needs more troops.
[01:08:10.389 --> 01:08:11.449]  Does that mean a draft?
[01:08:11.849 --> 01:08:14.610]  And number three, what happened to scholars for 9-11 truth?
[01:08:14.850 --> 01:08:16.430]  And I'll hang up and wait for your answer.
[01:08:16.450 --> 01:08:16.750]  Thank you.
[01:08:17.570 --> 01:08:20.231]  Okay, the first question, I got so busy thinking about the...
[01:08:21.795 --> 01:08:22.515]  The second two.
[01:08:22.655 --> 01:08:25.936]  Oh, yeah!
[01:08:26.476 --> 01:08:36.059]  84% of Americans in a New York Times, ABC News poll, Angus and Reed, very scientific, very respected, believe they're being lied to about the official 9-11 story.
[01:08:36.079 --> 01:08:45.622]  36% of Scripps Howard News Service, Ohio University, extremely respected, believe it is a total inside job, with 68% believing there's a cover-up.
[01:08:46.869 --> 01:08:56.974]  So any way you cut it, the majority think they're being lied to, and a large portion of the public, when they get a cold phone call, and that's a scary call.
[01:08:56.994 --> 01:08:58.035]  How do you think the government did it?
[01:09:00.036 --> 01:09:00.796]  Yes.
[01:09:00.816 --> 01:09:00.796]  36%.
[01:09:00.916 --> 01:09:07.500]  Studies show in polling data that if it's a really controversial question, people will err on the side of conservatism.
[01:09:07.900 --> 01:09:09.201]  And I don't mean that in the classical sense.
[01:09:09.261 --> 01:09:12.722]  I mean, they'll say what's more mainstream to their mind.
[01:09:13.163 --> 01:09:14.643]  So it's probably actually double that.
[01:09:15.404 --> 01:09:15.804]  But still...
[01:09:16.736 --> 01:09:17.277]  I think we're good to go.
[01:09:39.071 --> 01:09:42.033]  And so he appointed Henry Kissinger as the chairman.
[01:09:42.073 --> 01:09:44.375]  Everybody freaked out, you know, calling him independent.
[01:09:45.176 --> 01:09:54.403]  It now has come out that for at least four years, Kissinger has been at the White House every week advising Rove and Bush on the most minute details.
[01:09:55.144 --> 01:10:01.489]  So imagine, Kissinger's running the White House, and then he's going to be appointed chairman of the, quote, independent commission.
[01:10:01.509 --> 01:10:03.410]  Yeah, it's independent.
[01:10:04.191 --> 01:10:06.413]  I mean, that's, again, another insult to our intelligence.
[01:10:07.282 --> 01:10:17.047]  And so they go ahead and have Hamilton Commission, the Keene-Hamilton Commission, two big insiders, just as big as Kissinger, just less known.
[01:10:19.368 --> 01:10:21.429]  They put out a 400-and-something page lie.
[01:10:22.569 --> 01:10:23.250]  It doesn't work.
[01:10:23.870 --> 01:10:27.432]  And so in the court of public opinion, they've been convicted of 9-11.
[01:10:29.737 --> 01:10:44.386]  But the problem is the establishment is so corrupt, so many of the judges are corrupt, so many of the police are corrupt, so many of the grand juries are just rubber stamps who are told what to do because they never research what their real role is, that this corruption just goes on.
[01:10:45.447 --> 01:10:53.532]  I mean, 20 years ago, people went to prison for no-bid secret contracts to companies that their wife was a board member of.
[01:10:54.072 --> 01:10:56.814]  Vice President does it now, nothing's done.
[01:10:57.572 --> 01:10:59.273]  Years ago, people would go to prison.
[01:10:59.313 --> 01:11:03.416]  The whole government would be overthrown for almost $4 trillion.
[01:11:03.456 --> 01:11:07.079]  At the start of 2001, it was only $1.9 trillion.
[01:11:08.320 --> 01:11:11.682]  Two days after it breaks in the Associated Press, 9-11 happens.
[01:11:12.243 --> 01:11:12.843]  Just admit it.
[01:11:12.903 --> 01:11:13.744]  Trillions missing.
[01:11:14.124 --> 01:11:15.425]  It comes out in congressional hearings.
[01:11:15.485 --> 01:11:16.866]  Rumsfeld says, I don't know where it is.
[01:11:16.906 --> 01:11:17.767]  We're not going to discuss it.
[01:11:19.108 --> 01:11:20.469]  Trillions missing.
[01:11:22.598 --> 01:11:23.618]  Nobody goes to jail.
[01:11:23.659 --> 01:11:24.819]  Nobody gets in trouble.
[01:11:25.119 --> 01:11:34.443]  The American people get mad about Enron and Global Crossing and a few things, so they send Martha Stewart to prison for doing absolutely nothing.
[01:11:34.683 --> 01:11:43.627]  It's like she's got a crooked toenail, and they're busy basically axe-murdering our society, but she goes to jail for the crooked toenail.
[01:11:45.707 --> 01:11:46.888]  Ken Lay gets convicted.
[01:11:48.240 --> 01:11:58.268]  And rightfully so, but he was just a front man for a big drug cartel, big money laundering op, and big intelligence op, and he dies conveniently.
[01:11:58.328 --> 01:11:59.329]  I mean, come on.
[01:12:01.350 --> 01:12:02.852]  So, another illustration.
[01:12:02.892 --> 01:12:03.992]  Again, what I said last hour.
[01:12:04.012 --> 01:12:17.163]  90 plus percent don't want the toll roads on existing roads, don't want North American Union, don't want national ID cards, don't want forced psychological testing and drugging, don't like airport screening, don't like any of this.
[01:12:19.625 --> 01:12:22.666]  But the government is going to continue to push it.
[01:12:22.726 --> 01:12:24.326]  The media is going to continue to push it.
[01:12:24.466 --> 01:12:26.086]  Because they're owned by the big private banks.
[01:12:26.106 --> 01:12:28.487]  They're the only defense contractors that own big pharma.
[01:12:28.687 --> 01:12:32.368]  You know, I have a friend, a good friend who works for Continental Airlines in security.
[01:12:32.388 --> 01:12:34.208]  He said I could say that, just don't say his name.
[01:12:35.628 --> 01:12:37.229]  He's at the Austin-Bergstrom Airport.
[01:12:39.989 --> 01:12:42.490]  And he saw News 8 Austin earlier this year.
[01:12:44.731 --> 01:12:47.052]  Interview, he said it had to be over 40 people.
[01:12:47.312 --> 01:12:49.453]  A huge line of people that were walking by.
[01:12:49.813 --> 01:12:52.154]  They were interviewing him, had the permission of the airport.
[01:12:53.615 --> 01:12:55.276]  Of course, because it was going to be a puff piece.
[01:12:55.936 --> 01:12:57.136]  That's another way control works.
[01:12:57.216 --> 01:12:59.857]  If they don't do a puff piece, they can't come back and shoot later.
[01:12:59.877 --> 01:13:02.439]  See, that's where arbitrary press control is bad, too.
[01:13:02.639 --> 01:13:05.600]  Because it allows government to hand it out like lollipops.
[01:13:08.441 --> 01:13:11.362]  And he saw, after about 40 people, he was sitting there counting them.
[01:13:11.382 --> 01:13:12.143]  I think he said 45 people.
[01:13:13.456 --> 01:13:17.017]  This little old lady comes up and says she loves the new screening procedures.
[01:13:17.057 --> 01:13:22.278]  They just started some even more harsh ones, and she just thought it was wonderful, and she loved being searched to keep her safe.
[01:13:22.838 --> 01:13:25.438]  And he said he knew right then it'd be on News 8.
[01:13:26.539 --> 01:13:27.639]  He got home that night.
[01:13:27.839 --> 01:13:28.839]  I'm also friends with his brother.
[01:13:28.879 --> 01:13:29.499]  That's how I know him.
[01:13:30.239 --> 01:13:33.340]  He turns it on, and boom.
[01:13:33.800 --> 01:13:35.000]  Who do you see on the news?
[01:13:35.020 --> 01:13:38.961]  The little old lady and the news reporting that everybody loves it.
[01:13:42.495 --> 01:13:45.117]  Now, that should scare everybody.
[01:13:46.638 --> 01:13:53.442]  The fact that they get on the TV and radio, and I know I've been beating this drum because it's important, and tell you, it's the law, you've got to take vaccines.
[01:13:54.042 --> 01:13:54.462]  No law.
[01:13:57.104 --> 01:13:59.846]  It's the law, you've got to let cops search you without a warrant now.
[01:14:00.026 --> 01:14:01.447]  No law, what they're doing is illegal.
[01:14:03.168 --> 01:14:05.870]  Oh, everyone loves being searched and more security.
[01:14:06.370 --> 01:14:09.832]  The truth is they had to interview 45 people before it happened.
[01:14:11.798 --> 01:14:14.601]  The truth is, is 145th liked it.
[01:14:17.903 --> 01:14:30.434]  And so it's all the neocons and the fake liberal media all together telling us we're the minority, telling us we're bad, telling us we're conspiracy theorists, telling us we're kooks, telling us all this.
[01:14:30.775 --> 01:14:34.618]  And so if you expect some judge to order the...
[01:14:36.343 --> 01:14:42.484]  Investigation or to call in a grand jury or some district attorney to and for indictments to be handed down.
[01:14:42.964 --> 01:14:43.825]  Don't hold your breath.
[01:14:43.865 --> 01:14:53.007]  And you know, I don't expect us to go after Bush and his handlers right off the bat for running the attacks.
[01:14:53.027 --> 01:14:55.327]  You know, that happens once you indict them, once you arrest them.
[01:14:55.967 --> 01:14:56.287]  No, no, no.
[01:14:56.327 --> 01:15:02.109]  You get them on ordering FBI agents off the trail of who the government claims were the hijackers.
[01:15:02.429 --> 01:15:03.629]  We have them in triplicate.
[01:15:04.795 --> 01:15:21.603]  From Arizona to Illinois to Texas to Miami to California to Minnesota the code breakers, the interpreters, the FBI agents up on the news saying
[01:15:22.919 --> 01:15:28.281]  Up on the housetop, on the National Press Club saying, I'll be arrested if I tell you what I know.
[01:15:28.561 --> 01:15:30.082]  Here's the letter from John Ashcroft.
[01:15:30.442 --> 01:15:34.604]  All I can tell you is, and then the Bushes vacation with the Bin Ladens.
[01:15:37.905 --> 01:15:47.049]  See, that's an FBI agent, that's Robert Wright, who won't sell out, who won't just make an excuse and go along and get a bigger paycheck and move up the ladder and get big cash bonuses.
[01:15:49.150 --> 01:15:51.671]  That's somebody upset about 3,000 dead Americans.
[01:15:55.327 --> 01:15:58.008]  But, I mean, let's say that's too hard to go after Bush for.
[01:15:58.288 --> 01:16:00.129]  How about the trillions missing from the Pentagon?
[01:16:00.149 --> 01:16:01.030]  And get Bill Clinton, too.
[01:16:01.070 --> 01:16:01.670]  He was involved.
[01:16:03.051 --> 01:16:03.911]  You see, they're buddies.
[01:16:03.951 --> 01:16:04.832]  They work together.
[01:16:05.452 --> 01:16:06.593]  It's them against us.
[01:16:12.755 --> 01:16:17.098]  And then your other comment... John, do you remember what his other two points were?
[01:16:18.178 --> 01:16:19.119]  He had two other questions.
[01:16:21.780 --> 01:16:23.201]  Yeah, that scholar was one.
[01:16:23.221 --> 01:16:23.821]  There was another one.
[01:16:25.743 --> 01:16:39.687]  The other question was, Scholar for 9-11 Truth, you know, I try not, just like I said the other day, other shows that are unfortunately failures, almost all the other Patriot shows are not even one-tenth.
[01:16:39.707 --> 01:16:42.467]  In fact, there's no show even one-tenth the audience of this one.
[01:16:44.728 --> 01:16:51.950]  And I wish that wasn't the case, but it's because people don't like to tune in and constantly hear gossip and dirty laundry being aired.
[01:16:53.175 --> 01:17:04.721]  I do not agree with Jim Fetzer on his directed energy weapons space beam business, but I'm not trying to get in a fight with people.
[01:17:08.963 --> 01:17:19.368]  And I don't agree, and I think that Professor Jones is acting like a gentleman and has had some things done to him that aren't right.
[01:17:23.024 --> 01:17:25.346]  But, what does it mean?
[01:17:26.327 --> 01:17:28.849]  I mean, you were talking about legends in people's own minds.
[01:17:28.889 --> 01:17:32.532]  I mean, if I thought I was the end-all, be-all of 9-11 truth, I'd be a legend in my own mind.
[01:17:34.294 --> 01:17:40.018]  You get a bunch of scholars together, 400 and something of them, and you're going to have fights, and you're going to have power struggles.
[01:17:40.619 --> 01:17:42.060]  That happens in any society.
[01:17:42.861 --> 01:17:50.087]  And so now it's broken up, and Jones is starting a new organization that'll be peer-reviewed and have a board and
[01:17:50.757 --> 01:17:53.298]  And be transparent and have voting by all members.
[01:17:55.359 --> 01:17:58.199]  And I support that, and that's the way I think things should be done.
[01:17:58.480 --> 01:18:00.720]  But that's not my fight.
[01:18:00.860 --> 01:18:02.081]  I don't have a dog in that fight.
[01:18:02.101 --> 01:18:10.043]  I mean, really, the news here isn't about of the, well, if it's 84%, I mean, we're talking about 230-something million people
[01:18:19.324 --> 01:18:20.785]  Who believe we're being lied to about 9-11?
[01:18:21.565 --> 01:18:23.226]  So why should it be about two individuals?
[01:18:23.246 --> 01:18:27.587]  See, when I talk about 9-11, it isn't, I'm the only one you can trust.
[01:18:28.087 --> 01:18:29.448]  All the other researchers are bad.
[01:18:30.048 --> 01:18:30.728]  Listen to me.
[01:18:30.849 --> 01:18:31.669]  Make me king.
[01:18:32.309 --> 01:18:33.249]  It's, I'm not your leader.
[01:18:33.289 --> 01:18:34.030]  Go out and be leaders.
[01:18:34.230 --> 01:18:35.070]  That's how we're going to win.
[01:18:35.110 --> 01:18:36.651]  I'm trying to win the war.
[01:18:37.431 --> 01:18:38.271]  Teamwork here.
[01:18:39.012 --> 01:18:43.734]  So if some people on the sidelines are having fights with each other, I'm not worried about them.
[01:18:43.954 --> 01:18:44.754]  I'm on the field.
[01:18:46.201 --> 01:18:46.422]  Hut!
[01:18:46.583 --> 01:18:46.783]  Hut!
[01:18:46.904 --> 01:18:47.125]  Hut!
[01:18:47.225 --> 01:18:47.988]  Come on, let's go!
[01:18:48.148 --> 01:18:49.272]  Let's move it down the field!
[01:18:49.312 --> 01:18:49.794]  Come on!
[01:18:50.095 --> 01:18:50.817]  Get in the game!
[01:18:53.297 --> 01:18:53.738]  Gold.
[01:18:54.078 --> 01:18:55.379]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[01:18:55.639 --> 01:19:01.725]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[01:19:01.906 --> 01:19:05.729]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[01:19:06.090 --> 01:19:07.972]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[01:19:08.012 --> 01:19:10.314]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[01:19:10.454 --> 01:19:17.241]  The stage is being set for the re-emergence of gold as the common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weaker
[01:19:17.261 --> 01:19:18.462]  We're good to go.
[01:19:32.298 --> 01:19:34.721]  If you have ever thought about owning gold, you must read this report.
[01:19:34.801 --> 01:19:35.802]  Call Midas today at 800-686-2237.
[01:19:53.919 --> 01:19:54.579]  We're good to go.
[01:20:14.688 --> 01:20:21.149]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[01:20:21.349 --> 01:20:26.430]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[01:20:26.550 --> 01:20:35.432]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[01:20:35.692 --> 01:20:40.332]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5 by calling New Millennium at 888-
[01:20:44.113 --> 01:20:44.374]  803-4438.

[01:20:47.736 --> 01:20:48.076]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:21:13.098 --> 01:21:23.102]  Communism said they would pretend to collapse, and when America had begun to disarm, the combined communist world would launch a surprise attack and smash us with their clenched fists.
[01:21:23.880 --> 01:21:31.085]  We'd like to show you how these things are coming to pass by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[01:21:34.428 --> 01:21:35.048]  Call now.
[01:21:35.068 --> 01:21:37.650]  Operators are standing by to receive your call.
[01:21:51.534 --> 01:21:53.195]  Shelly, you look exhausted.
[01:21:53.255 --> 01:21:54.056]  What's wrong?
[01:21:54.076 --> 01:21:55.357]  I am so tired.
[01:21:55.417 --> 01:21:57.918]  I just get so hot at night and can't sleep.
[01:21:58.038 --> 01:21:59.119]  I have tried everything.
[01:21:59.179 --> 01:22:00.940]  All kinds of fans, sheets, pillows.
[01:22:01.080 --> 01:22:02.241]  You name it, I've tried it.
[01:22:02.361 --> 01:22:04.663]  My husband has always been a hot sleeper.
[01:22:04.823 --> 01:22:06.384]  He's never had a good night's sleep.
[01:22:06.624 --> 01:22:08.666]  Then we discovered something that really helps.
[01:22:08.786 --> 01:22:11.007]  It's called the BedFan Personal Cooling System.
[01:22:11.187 --> 01:22:11.708]  The what?
[01:22:11.988 --> 01:22:14.049]  The BedFan Personal Cooling System.
[01:22:14.189 --> 01:22:19.453]  It will keep you cool all night long and will work for everyone that sleeps hot, no matter what the reason.
[01:22:21.814 --> 01:22:22.935]  How well are you sleeping?
[01:22:23.155 --> 01:22:24.816]  Are you getting the rest your body needs?
[01:22:25.196 --> 01:22:29.519]  Sleep disorder centers across the country recommend that you must stay cool to get a good night's sleep.
[01:22:29.759 --> 01:22:33.062]  The Bed Fan will keep you cool and give you the restful sleep you deserve.
[01:22:33.282 --> 01:22:36.444]  With our 30-day 100% guarantee, you risk nothing.
[01:22:36.804 --> 01:22:37.685]  Are you a hot sleeper?
[01:22:37.905 --> 01:22:39.125]  Is your partner a hot sleeper?
[01:22:39.146 --> 01:22:42.388]  Or are you looking for the perfect gift for that person who has everything?
[01:22:42.648 --> 01:22:43.929]  The Bed Fan is the answer.
[01:22:44.149 --> 01:22:45.550]  Visit BedFan.com.
[01:22:45.810 --> 01:22:48.191]  That's BedFan.com.
[01:23:15.515 --> 01:23:29.797]  Yeah, a lot of people would think that if I came out and said, this group's good, that group's bad, all the years I've been savaged and attacked by different organizations, or when other people were fighting with each other, that that somehow is a good thing.
[01:23:31.179 --> 01:23:45.410]  And overall it isn't because it actually just gives more attention to it and then sends people to the negative bilge instead of busy getting informed on what they can prove for themselves and then going out and proselytizing and waking up others.
[01:23:46.270 --> 01:23:49.172]  Let's go ahead and talk to, who's up next here?
[01:23:50.453 --> 01:23:52.215]  Lewis in New Jersey, you're on the air.
[01:23:52.275 --> 01:23:52.655]  Go ahead.
[01:23:53.991 --> 01:23:54.992]  Thanks for having me, Alex.
[01:23:55.232 --> 01:23:55.552]  You bet.
[01:23:56.213 --> 01:24:00.335]  Just wanted to, I just had three items, wanted to just run them off real quick.
[01:24:01.516 --> 01:24:14.045]  Just wanted to let you know I was looking into the whole vaccine issue myself and called Merck and I was actually transferred to their National Service Center, they said, for legal reasons, whatever that is, and...
[01:24:14.952 --> 01:24:24.357]  And that they, yeah, like you say, claim that the vaccines no longer have mercury in them except for one, the guy said, one adult vaccine.
[01:24:25.241 --> 01:24:29.322]  Okay, well, I read the AP last week where they admit all the vaccines have it.
[01:24:29.342 --> 01:24:31.623]  What they did was make available lots that don't.
[01:24:31.683 --> 01:24:32.784]  So it's a lawyer lie.
[01:24:32.804 --> 01:24:34.904]  They go, no, no, no, the vaccines don't have mercury.
[01:24:35.224 --> 01:24:46.688]  Well, yes, they have some available in small lots that aren't, but then the CDC and the Food and Drug Administration get sued by families asking them to take the mercury out, and they say no.
[01:24:47.408 --> 01:24:50.309]  And then I have the AP reporting they've increased the amount of mercury.
[01:24:50.669 --> 01:24:53.270]  And then I have newscasts saying mercury is good for your brain.
[01:24:53.330 --> 01:24:54.190]  It's in the vaccines.
[01:24:54.210 --> 01:24:54.830]  Keep taking it.
[01:24:55.190 --> 01:24:58.511]  Well, regardless, I made the decision not to vaccinate, Mike.
[01:24:58.531 --> 01:24:59.392]  I have a one-year-old.
[01:24:59.432 --> 01:25:02.293]  Hey, look, sir, when you're there looking at the vaccine, just ask the doctor.
[01:25:02.473 --> 01:25:03.253]  How dare you ask?
[01:25:03.513 --> 01:25:04.693]  Let me see the ampule.
[01:25:04.733 --> 01:25:08.054]  Let me see it before you load it into an injector, into a syringe.
[01:25:08.614 --> 01:25:09.975]  And it'll say thimerosal.
[01:25:09.995 --> 01:25:13.896]  If it says thimerosal, that is mercury.
[01:25:14.668 --> 01:25:15.610]  Okay, yes, yes.
[01:25:16.471 --> 01:25:17.312]  Just two other points.
[01:25:17.893 --> 01:25:20.077]  I wanted to ask just your quick advice.
[01:25:20.197 --> 01:25:24.704]  I understand that you're not an expert in my question, but
[01:25:25.077 --> 01:25:25.638]  Real estate.
[01:25:25.778 --> 01:25:30.342]  What is a good position to be in as far as that with the expected coming crash?
[01:25:30.502 --> 01:25:33.604]  I can't really give advice on real estate because I own very little myself.
[01:25:33.664 --> 01:25:37.067]  I just have listened and read what the experts have said have been proven right over time.
[01:25:37.087 --> 01:25:39.069]  You see, I don't just believe somebody when they first say something.
[01:25:39.129 --> 01:25:41.531]  I look at people long term and see their history.
[01:25:42.072 --> 01:25:43.313]  And real estate is so complex.
[01:25:43.373 --> 01:25:45.835]  It depends on your region, where you live, what state.
[01:25:46.683 --> 01:25:48.024]  It depends on your finances.
[01:25:48.065 --> 01:25:50.106]  It's a very complex situation.
[01:25:50.146 --> 01:25:53.930]  But the establishment a year ago started saying, get out of real estate, get out of real estate, get out.
[01:25:54.190 --> 01:25:54.770]  It's going to bust.
[01:25:54.810 --> 01:25:55.371]  It's going to bust.
[01:25:55.691 --> 01:26:03.918]  They were trying to destroy a dollar sink, which was a place where people could put dollars that are being devalued rapidly.
[01:26:04.259 --> 01:26:08.342]  And sure, it's overinflated, but still there was some value in real estate.
[01:26:08.663 --> 01:26:11.065]  So that's why they were trying to destroy a place
[01:26:11.585 --> 01:26:12.626]  I think precious metals are important, too.
[01:26:12.686 --> 01:26:13.806]  You need some liquid cash.
[01:26:13.826 --> 01:26:16.287]  You need to... I mean, basically, have a lot of things there.
[01:26:16.447 --> 01:26:17.047]  All right.
[01:26:17.067 --> 01:26:17.688]  And I just wanted to ask...
[01:26:40.382 --> 01:26:45.386]  Ask you, please, explain what keeps you going in the fight.
[01:26:45.486 --> 01:26:49.469]  I know that, like you said before, sometimes you have those spells of depression, knowing what you know.
[01:26:49.990 --> 01:26:55.094]  And also, just give some insight into your source of spiritual power.
[01:26:55.114 --> 01:26:55.194]  Okay.
[01:26:56.975 --> 01:26:57.816]  Sure, thank you for the call.
[01:26:57.836 --> 01:26:59.097]  Those are all interesting questions.
[01:27:00.058 --> 01:27:01.179]  All important questions.
[01:27:01.419 --> 01:27:02.840]  People say, what keeps me going in the fight?
[01:27:02.880 --> 01:27:04.081]  Why do I work so hard so much?
[01:27:05.497 --> 01:27:07.620]  I'm committed to win this fight against the New World Order.
[01:27:07.740 --> 01:27:09.002]  I know we can defeat them.
[01:27:09.062 --> 01:27:13.447]  It doesn't mean the world's going to be a perfect place, but if you just give in to corruption, it's going to run all over you.
[01:27:13.867 --> 01:27:18.573]  Bullies always tell you you don't have a hope or prayer to beat them.
[01:27:18.873 --> 01:27:22.738]  And more times than not, if you actually just start swinging, they're going to end up going down.
[01:27:23.556 --> 01:27:24.557]  That's my life experience.
[01:27:24.577 --> 01:27:26.678]  It's the same thing with these corrupt people running our government.
[01:27:27.038 --> 01:27:34.082]  They always tell you you don't have any power, because they're a small group that took power, and so they know that small groups of people do have power.
[01:27:34.282 --> 01:27:35.683]  They're actually scared to death of us.
[01:27:35.703 --> 01:27:39.125]  That's why they try to dumb down whole societies.
[01:27:39.165 --> 01:27:43.827]  But more than just trying to win this fight and loving my family, I'm at the point of no return, folks.
[01:27:43.867 --> 01:27:45.128]  It's kind of like I'm in a little boat.
[01:27:45.728 --> 01:27:46.929]  I'm going to the new world.
[01:27:47.369 --> 01:27:49.430]  I've gotten 70% of the way there.
[01:27:49.470 --> 01:27:50.851]  The wind's blowing the right direction.
[01:27:50.871 --> 01:27:52.772]  I don't have food or water to go back to.
[01:27:53.402 --> 01:27:55.643]  So I've reached my point of no return a long time ago.
[01:27:56.843 --> 01:27:59.404]  The safest thing for me to do is stay out in front.
[01:27:59.964 --> 01:28:01.365]  Out in front of everybody.
[01:28:02.105 --> 01:28:04.306]  Out there reaching out to the general population.
[01:28:04.686 --> 01:28:05.946]  Getting other people to wake up.
[01:28:06.026 --> 01:28:10.448]  I mean, the most dangerous position for Alex Jones would be for me to stop doing what I'm doing.
[01:28:10.508 --> 01:28:11.348]  Stop writing books.
[01:28:11.368 --> 01:28:12.288]  Stop making films.
[01:28:12.889 --> 01:28:13.869]  Not being involved.
[01:28:13.889 --> 01:28:17.330]  You know, these whistleblowers all the time think they're safe when they do it in secret.
[01:28:17.390 --> 01:28:18.811]  No, you're dead meat when you do that.
[01:28:20.051 --> 01:28:22.152]  You're safe when you go public.
[01:28:22.292 --> 01:28:22.792]  Or safer.
[01:28:24.068 --> 01:28:34.617]  And overall, as a society, as a species, we're safer when we grow backbones, when we get a spinal transplant, and just go ahead and go into this fight 110%.
[01:28:35.178 --> 01:28:35.498]  Okay?
[01:28:35.878 --> 01:28:36.499]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:36.679 --> 01:28:40.542]  I'm scared of not fighting these bullets, because I know they're going to win if I don't fight them.
[01:28:40.802 --> 01:28:41.984]  At least I've got a fighting chance.
[01:28:43.745 --> 01:28:44.646]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.126 --> 01:28:46.748]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.648 --> 01:28:50.331]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:55.498 --> 01:28:59.620]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass?
[01:28:59.840 --> 01:29:01.601]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[01:29:01.881 --> 01:29:08.145]  If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough, the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[01:29:08.445 --> 01:29:14.568]  Using this similar principle, Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[01:29:14.828 --> 01:29:16.669]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument
[01:29:16.749 --> 01:29:17.349]  We're good to go.
[01:29:39.224 --> 01:29:39.444]  That's 1-866-885-6625.
[01:29:39.464 --> 01:29:39.524]  1-866-885-6625.
[01:29:53.115 --> 01:29:54.096]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[01:29:54.176 --> 01:29:58.939]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[01:29:59.119 --> 01:30:06.924]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[01:30:07.184 --> 01:30:12.547]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[01:30:12.768 --> 01:30:19.732]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[01:30:19.992 --> 01:30:20.452]  We're good to go.
[01:30:38.642 --> 01:30:44.888]  While paper investments currently have been driven by debt, gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years.
[01:30:45.209 --> 01:30:48.732]  For more information, call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:30:49.072 --> 01:30:49.953]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:30:52.476 --> 01:30:54.758]  Attention, attention everyone!
[01:30:54.838 --> 01:30:57.160]  A brand new invention just released.
[01:30:57.220 --> 01:31:01.685]  It's called Wrist Ease, the new patented portable ergonomic wrist support.
[01:31:02.325 --> 01:31:08.791]  Wrist Ease comforts your wrists from the sometimes painful tasks of typing, writing, using a mouse, or adding machine.
[01:31:09.312 --> 01:31:21.543]  Unlike most conventional wrist pads that are either attached to a mouse pad or lay flat in front of your keyboard, Wrist Ease is totally portable and ideal for laptop users and technicians who are constantly on the go.
[01:31:21.983 --> 01:31:25.767]  Wrist Ease is perfect for children doing homework or playing video games.
[01:31:26.187 --> 01:31:32.248]  WristEase provides the proper comfort and support for all ages and makes a great stocking stuffer.
[01:31:32.689 --> 01:31:38.710]  Honest, WristEase provides comfort for victims of carpal tunnel syndrome and other repetitive injuries.
[01:31:39.070 --> 01:31:41.931]  You can order WristEase now at WristEase.com.
[01:31:42.311 --> 01:31:48.592]  That's WristEase, W-R-I-S-T-E-A-S-E, WristEase.com.
[01:31:48.732 --> 01:31:51.213]  Once again, WristEase.com.
[01:31:56.002 --> 01:32:02.026]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:32:02.647 --> 01:32:05.629]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:32:08.791 --> 01:32:17.578]  In the last 24 hours, the big telecommunications lobbying consortium globally has announced a bunch of different plans to openly begin shutting down the web.
[01:32:18.678 --> 01:32:21.105]  Good old John McCain, Mr. Keating 5.
[01:32:21.566 --> 01:32:23.431]  Again, he's anti-corruption because he's such a big criminal.
[01:32:23.792 --> 01:32:27.160]  The guy we can trust has come out with a plan to basically start shutting down the web.
[01:32:27.808 --> 01:32:29.589]  So I thought I'd play this little three-minute clip.
[01:32:29.970 --> 01:32:37.635]  It's audio of an informative video we have up on prisonplanet.com that is titled Save the Internet.
[01:32:37.655 --> 01:32:39.276]  And then I'll quickly go to Danny and Skip.
[01:32:39.296 --> 01:32:41.577]  I know we've got a bunch of other callers, but you've been holding the longest.
[01:32:41.838 --> 01:32:47.381]  And we're going to go for the rest of the broadcast to our esteemed guest who I got a chance to interview Sunday on the syndicated show.
[01:32:47.421 --> 01:32:50.443]  I wanted to have her back for more questions because it was so interesting.
[01:32:51.004 --> 01:32:55.707]  And that is Barbara McLeod, anthropologist who worked on Apocalypto,
[01:32:57.131 --> 01:32:59.612]  But right now, let's go ahead and go to the Save the Internet.
[01:32:59.652 --> 01:33:00.072]  Here it is.
[01:33:01.332 --> 01:33:06.954]  The way the Internet works today, everyone is connected to each other through the same level playing field.
[01:33:07.714 --> 01:33:11.755]  But a handful of phone and cable companies want to change all that.
[01:33:15.536 --> 01:33:21.798]  They want to lock down parts of the web and make sites pay them more money to use it.
[01:33:22.878 --> 01:33:24.939]  Everyone else will get the slow lane.
[01:33:29.054 --> 01:33:29.935]  How will they do that?
[01:33:31.557 --> 01:33:35.902]  By killing one of the Internet's founding principles, net neutrality.
[01:33:38.424 --> 01:33:39.946]  So what is net neutrality?
[01:33:40.326 --> 01:33:43.029]  I'm not even sure what net neutrality means.
[01:33:46.893 --> 01:33:50.477]  You connect to the web through pipes owned by telephone and cable companies.
[01:33:50.945 --> 01:33:55.406]  But the deal is, they're not allowed to mess with what's inside those pipes.
[01:33:55.666 --> 01:34:05.528]  Whether it's Google or Yahoo, Lonely Girl or Bill O'Reilly, everyday citizens or business tycoons, everybody's website gets the same speed and quality.
[01:34:06.268 --> 01:34:08.549]  That's called net neutrality.
[01:34:09.189 --> 01:34:10.249]  So what's the debate?
[01:34:10.289 --> 01:34:11.510]  That actually seems quite fair.
[01:34:11.730 --> 01:34:13.670]  Yes, almost too fair.
[01:34:14.770 --> 01:34:17.391]  It's as though the richer companies get no advantage at all.
[01:34:18.300 --> 01:34:24.344]  The companies want to set up a restricted fast lane on the internet, but only for their partners and services.
[01:34:24.905 --> 01:34:30.589]  Only sites who pay them a huge fee would be allowed to use it, making them gatekeepers.
[01:34:36.613 --> 01:34:47.221]  This is really a debate over monopoly versus the ideas of even the smallest person being given access to every person in our country.
[01:34:48.234 --> 01:34:49.515]  That's what the genius of the Internet was.
[01:34:49.756 --> 01:34:54.780]  That it made the First Amendment a living document again for millions of Americans for whom it had lost its meaning.
[01:34:55.040 --> 01:34:58.624]  But this wide-open access could be slipping through our fingers.
[01:34:59.044 --> 01:35:02.247]  It happened, remember, to television, radio, and cable.
[01:35:02.788 --> 01:35:04.289]  It could happen to the Internet.
[01:35:12.757 --> 01:35:15.818]  Protesters are asking for help to defend Internet freedom.
[01:35:16.018 --> 01:35:20.220]  The group SaveTheInternet.com delivered thousands of signed petitions.
[01:35:20.300 --> 01:35:23.621]  A single refrain, save our democracy.
[01:35:23.981 --> 01:35:32.825]  Every day as more and more citizens learn about the issue of net neutrality, they realize that the Internet as they know it is very much at risk.
[01:35:33.465 --> 01:35:41.148]  SaveTheInternet.com is turning the tide in this battle, exploding to over 800 groups from across the political spectrum.
[01:35:43.965 --> 01:35:53.308]  Artists, internet celebrities, and over one million internet users like us who petitioned Congress to protect net neutrality.
[01:35:53.988 --> 01:36:01.050]  Together, we blocked an attack in the Senate in 2006 and sent dozens of internet freedom fighters to the new Congress.
[01:36:01.891 --> 01:36:07.612]  But the gatekeepers are launching a counterattack on Washington and on your state legislature.
[01:36:07.773 --> 01:36:12.374]  We need to raise the alarm now to make neutrality the law in our new Congress.
[01:36:20.640 --> 01:36:23.383]  Man the battle stations at SaveTheInternet.com.
[01:36:24.204 --> 01:36:28.768]  Sign the petition, call your congresspeople, and share this message with friends.
[01:36:29.169 --> 01:36:34.234]  And stay tuned for our plan to build a faster, more open, and accessible Internet in 2007.
[01:36:35.375 --> 01:36:38.518]  Use the Internet to save the Internet at SaveTheInternet.com.
[01:36:44.088 --> 01:36:46.089]  And yes, man your battle stations.
[01:36:46.189 --> 01:36:48.290]  Man the guns in the info war.
[01:36:48.770 --> 01:36:53.251]  As I have said over and over again, understand you pay exorbitant prices.
[01:36:53.411 --> 01:36:56.913]  I mean, it's huge profits when you connect with your internet service company.
[01:36:57.493 --> 01:37:00.914]  They then pay for all the bandwidth that they send out.
[01:37:00.974 --> 01:37:02.134]  They're sending out your data.
[01:37:02.154 --> 01:37:03.415]  They're paying for all of that.
[01:37:04.133 --> 01:37:05.635]  And then it goes on down the line.
[01:37:05.655 --> 01:37:07.576]  They're paying that phone company to tie in.
[01:37:07.817 --> 01:37:08.678]  They're making money.
[01:37:08.698 --> 01:37:13.863]  The phone companies get up and lie and say, we need to start shutting this down and not let people do this.
[01:37:13.943 --> 01:37:18.927]  And their other big scam is the Internet's dying because there's too much traffic on it.
[01:37:19.948 --> 01:37:27.476]  But at their actual big consortium meetings in Chicago and Austin and London in the last three years, and we've covered their minutes each year, just typing the Internet is dead.
[01:37:27.516 --> 01:37:28.477]  That's what they always announce.
[01:37:29.424 --> 01:37:38.915]  They say they're going to shut down the hubs, shut down the systems, and make the old Internet, the real Internet, fail, and then force you onto Internet, too.
[01:37:39.295 --> 01:37:49.186]  So they've got a bunch of different stratagem here to do this, to charge for emails, to charge if you're able to get around on the Internet, just to go through their hubs when you're already paying for it.
[01:37:49.958 --> 01:37:54.502]  But also, just to start... It's kind of like they built toll roads right next to the existing roads.
[01:37:55.062 --> 01:38:03.969]  And just like in the real toll road agreements here in Texas with Centra, they have agreements where if they don't make enough money on their new toll roads, they can shut down our roads to force them to use their roads.
[01:38:04.229 --> 01:38:05.730]  Well, that's what they're doing here.
[01:38:06.711 --> 01:38:08.492]  And we raised this alarm many years ago.
[01:38:08.572 --> 01:38:09.633]  People finally get it.
[01:38:10.594 --> 01:38:11.454]  They finally know.
[01:38:11.474 --> 01:38:14.637]  I mean, we write articles two, three years ago saying they're attacking the net.
[01:38:14.657 --> 01:38:15.377]  They want to shut it down.
[01:38:15.397 --> 01:38:17.419]  People are like, sure, Jones, sure.
[01:38:17.739 --> 01:38:18.500]  Just like when I...
[01:38:20.413 --> 01:38:21.834]  Broke the Building 7 story.
[01:38:21.854 --> 01:38:24.215]  We were always talking about it since the afternoon of 9-11.
[01:38:24.856 --> 01:38:27.157]  And then some folks found the clip and put it on a little website.
[01:38:27.177 --> 01:38:27.818]  We picked it up.
[01:38:27.978 --> 01:38:29.439]  It went supernova on the web.
[01:38:29.739 --> 01:38:34.922]  And I remember other talk show hosts on Genesis calling me and going, This Building 7, we don't know.
[01:38:35.062 --> 01:38:36.543]  Alex, you're out on a limb.
[01:38:36.583 --> 01:38:37.583]  You're being uncredible.
[01:38:37.824 --> 01:38:40.385]  And now it's just accepted knowledge that they blew up Building 7.
[01:38:41.046 --> 01:38:43.367]  And Silverstein's quote is what he said.
[01:38:44.500 --> 01:38:50.102]  And so we try to trailblaze here, and I'm not tooting my horn, hey, we trailblazed on this, we trailblazed on that.
[01:38:50.582 --> 01:38:52.562]  I'm just telling you folks, you should really listen to us.
[01:38:53.102 --> 01:38:54.623]  I mean, it's as bad as we're saying.
[01:38:55.603 --> 01:38:56.823]  I don't have words to describe it.
[01:38:56.843 --> 01:39:01.765]  Do you think they're just going to let us make the newspapers go out of business?
[01:39:01.865 --> 01:39:04.525]  Do you think they're just going to let us destroy national television?
[01:39:04.545 --> 01:39:08.126]  Do you think they're just going to let us take over mainstream radio?
[01:39:08.627 --> 01:39:09.307]  Because we are.
[01:39:10.487 --> 01:39:10.987]  No, no, no, no.
[01:39:11.267 --> 01:39:13.668]  The existing order is fighting back.
[01:39:14.648 --> 01:39:14.988]  Alright?
[01:39:16.109 --> 01:39:17.170]  We're all for free market.
[01:39:17.210 --> 01:39:22.514]  We think they should be able to be on the web, do what they want unobstructed, because we believe in the market of ideas we can win.
[01:39:22.614 --> 01:39:23.975]  We're ready to actually play.
[01:39:24.396 --> 01:39:25.817]  But see, they want to tie our hands.
[01:39:25.837 --> 01:39:33.923]  It's like a football game where they go, okay, now we're going to break one of your feet, we're going to tie one of your hands behind your back, and now you can get on the field and play with us.
[01:39:34.284 --> 01:39:34.444]  No!
[01:39:36.118 --> 01:39:37.238]  All right, I said I'd go to these calls.
[01:39:37.278 --> 01:39:38.579]  My guest is sitting here patiently.
[01:39:39.359 --> 01:39:42.079]  Let's just very quickly go to two callers that I promised I'd go to.
[01:39:42.099 --> 01:39:44.260]  We'll go to our guest for the rest of the transmission.
[01:39:44.820 --> 01:39:46.220]  Let's talk to Danny in Tennessee.
[01:39:46.240 --> 01:39:46.800]  You're on the air.
[01:39:46.820 --> 01:39:47.221]  Go ahead.
[01:39:47.241 --> 01:39:48.701]  Hi, Alex.
[01:39:48.721 --> 01:39:49.561]  Good to talk to you again.
[01:39:49.581 --> 01:39:54.262]  I'd like to start off just by saying happy birthday to my mom, a five-year listener.
[01:39:54.522 --> 01:39:55.102]  Fantastic.
[01:39:55.322 --> 01:39:55.582]  Good.
[01:39:56.042 --> 01:39:56.803]  Happy birthday, Mom.
[01:39:57.643 --> 01:39:58.783]  Thanks, man.
[01:39:59.043 --> 01:40:02.704]  Also, I wanted to just ask for more people in Hollywood.
[01:40:03.248 --> 01:40:07.730]  If they know what's going on, if they're aware of what's going on and have questions about 9-11, to come out.
[01:40:08.850 --> 01:40:11.631]  Start a group, Hollywood for 9-11 Truth or something.
[01:40:11.751 --> 01:40:12.972]  It's come out all at once.
[01:40:14.032 --> 01:40:17.534]  Then two quick questions in closing, if you could touch on these, Alex.
[01:40:18.694 --> 01:40:23.516]  One was about Boeing, how these debunkers are trying to use Boeing of the columns.
[01:40:23.536 --> 01:40:26.517]  They're trying to debunk loose change.
[01:40:26.697 --> 01:40:30.539]  I've seen a debate with Burmese Avery and Mark Roberts.
[01:40:31.553 --> 01:40:36.177]  And he tried to attack, like, Stephen Jones and, you know, the whole idea of thermite and all that.
[01:40:36.197 --> 01:40:38.398]  I was wondering if you can touch on that real quick.
[01:40:39.139 --> 01:40:42.201]  And also, I was wondering whatever happened with Loro Chavez.
[01:40:42.962 --> 01:40:43.962]  It was very interesting.
[01:40:43.982 --> 01:40:45.243]  You had him come out once.
[01:40:45.764 --> 01:40:46.945]  He was an interesting guest.
[01:40:47.505 --> 01:40:50.227]  And then he got slammed and attacked and he didn't want to go public anymore.
[01:40:50.667 --> 01:40:52.229]  Let me answer your other question quickly.
[01:40:52.249 --> 01:40:52.909]  I've got to let you go.
[01:40:54.250 --> 01:40:55.631]  You were asking about...
[01:40:57.325 --> 01:41:00.527]  The popular mechanics type people and others that come out.
[01:41:00.927 --> 01:41:02.928]  First, the government said fire made the steel melt.
[01:41:03.608 --> 01:41:07.430]  Then they said fire weakened the steel and made it buckle and fall and pancake.
[01:41:08.031 --> 01:41:09.191]  But they don't ever want to talk about Building 7.
[01:41:10.112 --> 01:41:16.895]  Underwriting laboratories that underwrote the buildings looked at Tower 1, 2, and 7 and said that fire couldn't do that.
[01:41:17.255 --> 01:41:21.198]  The firefighters on record, and we have video of it, said it was like a foundry.
[01:41:21.278 --> 01:41:23.899]  Pools of molten steel gushing.
[01:41:24.665 --> 01:41:25.967]  Now, you think jet fuel does that?
[01:41:26.047 --> 01:41:26.427]  It doesn't.
[01:41:26.467 --> 01:41:29.891]  It burns at well below 1,000 degrees what it takes to even weaken steel.
[01:41:30.632 --> 01:41:40.583]  You have people standing in the holes where the hottest fires were burning, and they're not melting, but giant four-foot-around steel columns are melting to where it was like a foundry.
[01:41:40.603 --> 01:41:44.407]  The firefighters said it was columns just gushing liquid steel.
[01:41:45.800 --> 01:41:46.120]  Okay?
[01:41:46.461 --> 01:41:47.722]  It doesn't start melting.
[01:41:48.322 --> 01:41:55.948]  Steel doesn't start melting until 2,754 degrees to 3,300, depending on the type of steel.
[01:41:56.108 --> 01:41:58.430]  Just type steel melt temp into Google.
[01:41:58.450 --> 01:42:01.252]  You'll get University Studies.
[01:42:02.093 --> 01:42:02.373]  Okay?
[01:42:02.693 --> 01:42:04.014]  2,700 and something to 3,300.
[01:42:04.375 --> 01:42:05.876]  That's the range.
[01:42:06.196 --> 01:42:07.557]  Not 1,800 jet fuel.
[01:42:08.097 --> 01:42:10.539]  Okay, then they claim pancake, and they say, well, it weakened the steel.
[01:42:11.080 --> 01:42:13.882]  Oh, and caused it to all explode and be sheared off perfectly and to melt.
[01:42:14.455 --> 01:42:15.196]  It's impossible.
[01:42:15.456 --> 01:42:23.744]  Then you've got seven hit by no plane, hit by no building, and just magically with a CIA base in it, blows up and falls perfectly.
[01:42:24.505 --> 01:42:24.785]  Okay?
[01:42:25.386 --> 01:42:27.628]  Quickly, Skip in California, let me go to our guest.
[01:42:27.648 --> 01:42:28.069]  Go, Skip.
[01:42:30.051 --> 01:42:37.198]  Yes, I don't know how to make a webpage myself, but I have an idea, and everyone I've told it to thinks it needs to be out there.
[01:42:37.398 --> 01:42:38.159]  Okay, what's your idea?
[01:42:39.448 --> 01:42:47.353]  There should be a webpage out there that basically, in layman terms, breaks down everything, all the executive orders like 1100 or 1010990 that
[01:42:52.136 --> 01:42:53.117]  You know what I'm talking about?
[01:42:53.417 --> 01:42:54.558]  Yes.
[01:42:55.878 --> 01:42:57.199]  Well, it says in plain language.
[01:42:57.219 --> 01:42:58.340]  You can read the executive order.
[01:42:58.720 --> 01:43:01.262]  We can put you in FEMA camps, put you in slave labor camps.
[01:43:01.282 --> 01:43:02.583]  I mean, it's all in the executive orders.
[01:43:03.043 --> 01:43:10.968]  Well, my idea is have something there that breaks it down really simple for anybody to see and then has a link to the page where you can see it for yourself.
[01:43:11.128 --> 01:43:15.991]  I've actually written an article and others have written articles where they do show executive orders and break them down.
[01:43:16.531 --> 01:43:17.232]  That's been done.
[01:43:18.720 --> 01:43:22.482]  Well, what about something that hits everything, the Military Commissions Act?
[01:43:22.682 --> 01:43:23.623]  I'd love to hit everything.
[01:43:23.763 --> 01:43:24.363]  I'd love to.
[01:43:24.903 --> 01:43:26.024]  No, I'm not saying you.
[01:43:26.084 --> 01:43:30.586]  Any listener out there, put something together, someone that does know how to make a webpage.
[01:43:31.727 --> 01:43:38.090]  Yeah, no, you can put a lot of the stuff out there, but new things happen faster than you could ever even read them, much less analyze them and post them.
[01:43:38.430 --> 01:43:40.311]  That's the problem with tens of millions of laws.
[01:43:40.612 --> 01:43:41.192]  Great idea.
[01:43:41.272 --> 01:43:41.912]  Thanks for the call.
[01:43:41.952 --> 01:43:42.573]  I appreciate it.
[01:43:42.953 --> 01:43:43.313]  All right.
[01:43:44.761 --> 01:43:52.640]  The reason I've spent a couple segments on different shows talking about this is because I'm just a minor buff, you know, been down to...
[01:43:53.530 --> 01:43:53.890]  We're good to go.
[01:44:15.217 --> 01:44:15.857]  We're good to go.
[01:44:44.958 --> 01:44:47.461]  It's this Julie Guernsey, I guess you pronounce it.
[01:44:48.122 --> 01:44:51.405]  And we find one of the crazier quotes here.
[01:44:51.425 --> 01:44:54.168]  It says, you just hate the movie, the reporter said.
[01:44:54.308 --> 01:44:54.729]  I hate it.
[01:44:55.309 --> 01:44:56.030]  I despise it.
[01:44:56.050 --> 01:44:56.991]  Well, that's very intellectual.
[01:44:57.972 --> 01:44:58.893]  I think it's despicable.
[01:44:59.354 --> 01:45:00.375]  Three ad hominems.
[01:45:01.135 --> 01:45:03.876]  It's offensive to Mayan people, not the ones we talk to, folks.
[01:45:04.216 --> 01:45:12.758]  It's offensive to those of us who try to teach cultural sensitivity and alternative worldviews that might not match our own 21st century Western ones, but are nonetheless valid.
[01:45:12.798 --> 01:45:13.718]  It's nonetheless valid.
[01:45:14.178 --> 01:45:16.219]  And then I actually pulled out her three quotes here.
[01:45:17.479 --> 01:45:22.841]  She said that the human sacrifice was valid, pious act, and done with solemnity.
[01:45:24.441 --> 01:45:24.721]  Okay.
[01:45:25.746 --> 01:45:30.853]  I'm not against Mesoamerican people, but I'm not against Romans of today either.
[01:45:32.535 --> 01:45:35.857]  By the end of it, I mean, sometimes thousands of people in a week would die.
[01:45:35.877 --> 01:45:41.559]  They would just run the circus 12 hours a day, and this was more of a stylized murder.
[01:45:42.159 --> 01:45:49.002]  By the end, they were throwing babies, women into wild animals, mass killing, burning people on pyres, burning Christians.
[01:45:49.803 --> 01:45:53.745]  Sometimes they'd conquer a city, salt the earth, and kill half the population.
[01:45:53.785 --> 01:45:56.806]  I mean, those are real, written-down Josephus accounts.
[01:45:57.583 --> 01:46:03.088]  And so if I talk about the barbarous behavior of what humans do over and over again, this is the norm, not the exception.
[01:46:03.369 --> 01:46:13.398]  Mass sacrifice, fires, burning, war, murder, piles of dead bodies, bloodletting, hallucinating, priests, sacrificing animals, guts spilling out everywhere.
[01:46:13.418 --> 01:46:15.780]  I mean, that is the norm.
[01:46:16.201 --> 01:46:19.684]  Humans have this desire, have this taste, have this drive.
[01:46:19.864 --> 01:46:20.665]  And so when I talk about
[01:46:21.720 --> 01:46:27.542]  The bog people of Ireland, they find all the nobles with their brains bashed out and their throats slit in the peat bogs.
[01:46:27.822 --> 01:46:31.563]  When I talk about all of that, I'm not bashing the Irish.
[01:46:32.063 --> 01:46:45.406]  But boy, you talk about the Mayan, you talk about the Aztecs, you talk about these different cultures down there, they will get mad, they will get mad in a hurry, because you're not allowed to talk about this, you're just an evil right-winger, you're just a racist.
[01:46:45.466 --> 01:46:45.746]  No, no, no.
[01:46:46.026 --> 01:46:48.947]  The Nazis had a culture of killing and murdering and skulls and death.
[01:46:49.634 --> 01:46:53.937]  And I can say I disagree with that culture and think it was pretty darn out of control and decadent and evil.
[01:46:54.557 --> 01:46:58.920]  And whenever they come at me with that, I come back at them with the Nazi thing, and they go, oh, yeah.
[01:46:59.541 --> 01:47:02.363]  So I just don't get her vicious attack on Mel Gibson.
[01:47:02.383 --> 01:47:04.944]  She says, first he went after the Jews, and now he's done with them.
[01:47:04.984 --> 01:47:05.945]  He's going after the Mayans.
[01:47:06.405 --> 01:47:09.668]  Though this film had a lot of Mayans in it, Mayans that have seen it, liked it.
[01:47:09.708 --> 01:47:15.672]  We've got, and we're going to break and come right back to her, Barbara McLeod on with us, and she...
[01:47:16.676 --> 01:47:26.009]  There's also a pilot who does stunt flying, done 52 continuous rotations, and she earned her Ph.D.
[01:47:26.249 --> 01:47:34.140]  in anthropology in 1990, specializing in Mayan hieroglyphic decipherment so she can read and speak.
[01:47:34.580 --> 01:47:35.461]  Thank you, Alex, for having me.
[01:47:35.481 --> 01:47:35.701]  You bet.
[01:47:35.721 --> 01:47:39.025]  Thanks for sitting here during the last segment while I was ranting.
[01:47:53.920 --> 01:47:54.960]  Oh, no, no, that's great.
[01:47:55.100 --> 01:47:55.541]  That's good.
[01:47:55.721 --> 01:48:02.362]  When you came into the KLBJ studio for the Sunday syndicated show from 4 to 6, I didn't know that you actually listened to the show.
[01:48:02.663 --> 01:48:08.264]  I mean, I knew you'd emailed us some comments about Apocalypto defending it that we posted last week, but I didn't know.
[01:48:08.284 --> 01:48:10.425]  I was kind of being, well, you know what we do here?
[01:48:10.985 --> 01:48:11.965]  I didn't want to scare you off.
[01:48:11.985 --> 01:48:14.206]  No, no, you are a listener.
[01:48:14.446 --> 01:48:15.766]  She knows what you do here.
[01:48:19.188 --> 01:48:19.608]  You bet.
[01:48:21.230 --> 01:48:24.273]  What are some of the things we can talk about in the next hour and ten minutes when we get back?
[01:48:24.534 --> 01:48:38.249]  Well, you've already kicked it off with the idea of human bloodlust, and I would like to zero in on how some of that bloodlust is channeled into rights of animal sacrifice and human sacrifice, which are also very, very common.
[01:48:38.849 --> 01:48:41.290]  In religions around the world, including our own.
[01:48:41.910 --> 01:49:05.759]  And I think we should talk about just types of sacrifice and how different cultures deal with this and how that ties into how the Aztecs and the Maya chose to deal with it and to maybe push it ahead into an idealization of how do we deal with this bloodlust, how do we channel it in a way that creates peace and harmony and contains it.
[01:49:06.717 --> 01:49:08.858]  And I have some ideas about that.
[01:49:09.118 --> 01:49:13.139]  Also, you've got some of the speeches from the film.
[01:49:13.339 --> 01:49:13.640]  I do.
[01:49:13.700 --> 01:49:16.380]  We'll read them in English and then in, is it Yucatec?
[01:49:16.641 --> 01:49:17.881]  This is Yucatec Maya.
[01:49:18.181 --> 01:49:20.662]  It's a language that in the past I've spoken fluently.
[01:49:20.682 --> 01:49:23.803]  I'm a little rusty at it now, but my pronunciation is still good.
[01:49:23.863 --> 01:49:25.003]  I've taught it for 10 years.
[01:49:25.344 --> 01:49:29.025]  I've taught bare-bones beginners to speak this language quite well.
[01:49:29.985 --> 01:49:33.830]  And I've got some speeches here from Apocalypto because I worked on it.
[01:49:33.930 --> 01:49:36.153]  We'll also tell some Mel Gibson stories that are pretty interesting.
[01:49:36.653 --> 01:49:38.415]  On the other side, folks, stay with us.
[01:49:38.595 --> 01:49:40.417]  Barbara McLeod is our guest.
[01:49:40.998 --> 01:49:43.561]  We're honored to have us here in studio with us today.
[01:49:43.981 --> 01:49:49.868]  Coast to coast, border to border, talking about interesting subjects, trying to inform the population about the nature of man.
[01:49:49.888 --> 01:49:50.329]  Stay with us.
[01:49:56.636 --> 01:49:59.777]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[01:50:00.137 --> 01:50:02.058]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[01:50:02.458 --> 01:50:10.120]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:50:10.780 --> 01:50:17.843]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:50:18.243 --> 01:50:21.184]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran.
[01:50:21.564 --> 01:50:23.885]  A White House program to disseminate fake news.
[01:50:24.305 --> 01:50:25.145]  NSA spies.

[01:52:59.728 --> 01:53:02.790]  Barbara McLeod is our guest here in studio.
[01:53:03.650 --> 01:53:07.092]  Out of the gates, I want to talk about what you did on the film so people get an idea about that.
[01:53:07.192 --> 01:53:14.777]  First off, I was just thinking, not only is Mel Gibson and myself, anybody that talks about the Mayan doing human sacrifice, the Aztecs,
[01:53:15.365 --> 01:53:17.747]  You know, either it doesn't exist or we're evil to talk about it.
[01:53:18.167 --> 01:53:27.915]  I've had the modern occultists, I guess kind of the druid type folks, the pagans, email me, call me and go, there was no human sacrifice in Europe either.
[01:53:27.955 --> 01:53:28.856]  You're lying.
[01:53:29.396 --> 01:53:30.417]  It's a Christian lie.
[01:53:31.018 --> 01:53:31.518]  No, no, no, no.
[01:53:31.558 --> 01:53:32.579]  They admit all this.
[01:53:32.599 --> 01:53:35.041]  They dig up the bodies.
[01:53:35.401 --> 01:53:36.362]  In Europe it's admitted.
[01:53:36.602 --> 01:53:38.704]  Humans did this all over the world.
[01:53:39.124 --> 01:53:42.087]  Why do you think human sacrifice is global?
[01:53:43.228 --> 01:53:44.629]  Well, I think first of all,
[01:53:45.569 --> 01:53:47.890]  Humans as a species do have a bloodlust.
[01:53:48.990 --> 01:54:00.335]  And there are various ways in which that can be expressed and channeled in the community, and it's one of the issues for every culture, how to channel it in such a way that it doesn't backfire on the community itself.
[01:54:00.415 --> 01:54:02.235]  Now it's sports and war.
[01:54:02.375 --> 01:54:04.196]  Sports and war are one way to do it.
[01:54:04.656 --> 01:54:07.377]  If you've got somebody to go to war with, then you've got a way to channel it.
[01:54:08.718 --> 01:54:14.220]  But whether or not you've got somebody to go to war with, there have to be other ritualized ways of channeling it.
[01:54:14.950 --> 01:54:24.170]  And one of the more common ones, I won't say it's absolutely universal, but it's common in cultures around the world that have, to our knowledge, have had no contact with each other.
[01:54:25.504 --> 01:54:45.509]  It's the idea of scapegoating someone or picking someone of the community or something in the community on which all the sins of the community can be heaped and then that is ritually sacrificed as an offering to God or the gods and it helps to purge the community of sin.
[01:54:45.609 --> 01:54:46.950]  That's what they do at Bohemian Grove.
[01:54:46.970 --> 01:54:52.051]  They do a mock sacrifice and they say we're putting all our cares, all our problems on top of this voodoo doll.
[01:54:52.311 --> 01:54:52.471]  Right.
[01:54:53.052 --> 01:54:55.813]  Right, and that idea is a very common one.
[01:54:55.893 --> 01:54:58.533]  I would say it's one of those archetypal motifs.
[01:54:58.573 --> 01:55:02.274]  Why do you think those old men at Bohemian Grove, I was in the crowd, they were taking it very serious.
[01:55:02.294 --> 01:55:07.576]  They were very solemn and, yeah, kill them, get them, get them, and it was just an effigy, but they were getting off on it.
[01:55:08.136 --> 01:55:17.458]  Well, they've, I assume, I mean, you were there, so I can only guess that they've already been drawn into the ritual atmosphere that,
[01:55:18.513 --> 01:55:20.214]  Ritual creates sacred space.
[01:55:21.594 --> 01:55:30.658]  One goes into that sacred space in a formal way and you put certain aspects of yourself aside and you take on certain other aspects of yourself.
[01:55:31.599 --> 01:55:32.819]  You take on a new identity.
[01:55:32.859 --> 01:55:37.501]  You may put on a robe or put on those Boy Scout uniforms or whatever it is that they're wearing.
[01:55:38.322 --> 01:55:38.482]  And...
[01:55:39.417 --> 01:55:40.938]  And you take on a new personality.
[01:55:40.998 --> 01:55:49.841]  And so solemnity, if that's part of the ritual, solemnity is going to be consolidated by the community in that sacred space.
[01:55:49.901 --> 01:55:52.482]  So it literally spreads from person to person, the attitude.
[01:55:53.200 --> 01:55:53.721]  Absolutely.
[01:55:53.941 --> 01:56:05.234]  Yeah, it's something that they're also trained to do, that they learn in the process of becoming initiated into that, that they set aside certain aspects of themselves as they go into that sacred space.
[01:56:05.274 --> 01:56:09.279]  Yeah, Mike Hansen was going, oh, I like this, and we're all looking at him, and Mike was like, oh, this is nice!
[01:56:09.299 --> 01:56:09.379]  Yeah.
[01:56:09.859 --> 01:56:12.520]  I was like, Mike, no, no, look, they're all real serious.
[01:56:12.640 --> 01:56:12.900]  Right.
[01:56:13.740 --> 01:56:14.120]  Amazing.
[01:56:14.380 --> 01:56:15.521]  Okay, we're going to break here in a moment.
[01:56:15.541 --> 01:56:28.924]  We have plenty of time coming up in the next segments, but just give us an idea of your training first, and then we'll come back and talk about how you got involved in Apocalypto and then go into the film itself and then into the wider aspects of anthropology.
[01:56:29.628 --> 01:56:31.949]  Well, I have a PhD in anthropology.
[01:56:32.029 --> 01:56:35.769]  I've been studying the Maya for about 35 years.
[01:56:36.790 --> 01:56:40.350]  And I did my initial training at the University of Washington in Seattle.
[01:56:40.850 --> 01:56:47.292]  I wasn't a Mayanist at that time, but while I lived in Seattle, I made my first trip down to the Maya area to explore caves.
[01:56:47.812 --> 01:56:51.032]  I was very seriously into cave exploring for many years before that.
[01:56:51.993 --> 01:56:57.994]  And so I jumped into cave exploring in Belize and started finding Maya artifacts in all the caves.
[01:56:58.574 --> 01:57:01.798]  As well as sacrificial burials or interments.
[01:57:01.998 --> 01:57:03.299]  Actually, they're not truly interments.
[01:57:03.680 --> 01:57:06.403]  They were just bones laid out under stones.
[01:57:07.404 --> 01:57:10.227]  Full bodies laid out under stones and left behind in caves.
[01:57:10.627 --> 01:57:11.468]  Along with artifacts.
[01:57:11.528 --> 01:57:13.190]  And I became really interested in all this stuff.
[01:57:13.777 --> 01:57:27.561]  Went back, finished up my degree in anthropology, went into the Peace Corps, and was hired by the Archaeology Department of the country to study caves and to help develop national park programs as well as... Stop right there.
[01:57:27.601 --> 01:57:30.442]  We'll finish up when we get back and then get into Apocalypto with our guest.
[01:57:33.443 --> 01:57:37.344]  If you would like a copy of this show, come to GCNlive.com and reserve it today.
[01:57:37.684 --> 01:57:38.464]  Or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[01:57:49.432 --> 01:57:50.073]  Big Brother.
[01:57:50.733 --> 01:57:51.774]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:52.494 --> 01:57:53.595]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.256 --> 01:57:55.096]  You want answers?
[01:57:55.837 --> 01:57:56.737]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:56.757 --> 01:58:01.201]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:01.581 --> 01:58:05.684]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:06.504 --> 01:58:12.028]  Barbara McLeod is our guest in this third and final hour today on this Thursday edition.
[01:58:12.048 --> 01:58:13.089]  We'll be live tomorrow.
[01:58:13.549 --> 01:58:15.571]  We'll be live Christmas Eve on the Sunday show.
[01:58:16.727 --> 01:58:30.150]  We're talking about the film Apocalypto and the Mayanists, that's the people that study it, I guess the subdivision of anthropology, who got upset by the film and then claimed that the Mayan didn't like it, though the Mayans we've talked to and that my guests have talked to did like the film.
[01:58:30.730 --> 01:58:41.012]  And it's as accurate as you can get trying to condense all these different cultures into, I guess you could say, a two and a half hour film.
[01:58:43.894 --> 01:58:45.135]  We're good to go.
[01:59:08.291 --> 01:59:18.499]  Okay, well, I think that I got into the Maya through my very strong interest in caving and my exposure to these wonderful caves down in Belize.
[01:59:19.339 --> 01:59:23.943]  And I came back after that first trip down there as a Peace Corps volunteer.
[01:59:24.623 --> 01:59:30.988]  My job was to study the caves for the archaeology department, help them develop a national parks program,
[01:59:31.924 --> 01:59:36.727]  And also report back to the archaeology department about the artifacts that I was finding in caves.
[01:59:37.288 --> 01:59:46.134]  So that was a wonderful exposure, and it also allowed me to have firsthand evidence for human sacrifice because the caves are full of it.
[01:59:47.179 --> 01:59:56.771]  So after five years of this kind of work, I moved to Austin and went to graduate school and got a master's degree and then a PhD in anthropology.
[01:59:57.632 --> 02:00:05.542]  And I started out in archaeology, but I actually slid over onto the linguistic side of the fence because I've always been very, very interested in languages and
[02:00:06.175 --> 02:00:08.016]  The Mayan languages fascinated me.
[02:00:08.096 --> 02:00:11.557]  I had a lot of exposure to different speakers of Mayan languages and beliefs.
[02:00:11.577 --> 02:00:15.238]  Haven't you pioneered a lot of discoveries and developments now with your knowledge of the language?
[02:00:15.518 --> 02:00:21.380]  I have, not only in the studies of the languages, but also in the studies of the hieroglyphs.
[02:00:22.040 --> 02:00:32.123]  Because I was one of the early pioneers in the linguistic approach to hieroglyphic decipherment, identifying the little bits and pieces of affixes
[02:00:32.631 --> 02:00:33.912]  I think we're good to go.
[02:00:53.322 --> 02:01:03.208]  I'm, of course, very, very interested in what they said, but it's how they said it that really excites me the most, because that's my frontier, and that's my major contribution.
[02:01:03.288 --> 02:01:07.911]  Who is this art teacher at UT that's so mad at Mel Gibson?
[02:01:08.491 --> 02:01:11.693]  Well, I do know her, actually, and she's a friend of mine.
[02:01:12.174 --> 02:01:19.178]  We haven't had a chance to talk about Apocalypto, and sparks might fly if we did, but I suppose maybe there'll be an opportunity in the future.
[02:01:20.293 --> 02:01:22.756]  No, she's very serious about her study of the Maya.
[02:01:22.776 --> 02:01:23.897]  She's got a lot of experience.
[02:01:24.318 --> 02:01:25.299]  She's an art historian.
[02:01:25.940 --> 02:01:34.751]  She was a graduate student here at UT, and she's kind of come up through the ranks and studied with a lot of well-known expert people, and now she's a professor here at UT.
[02:01:35.789 --> 02:01:36.069]  I think so.
[02:02:00.919 --> 02:02:06.682]  Well, you can't even take a chronological slice of history all from one period and show it all in two and a half hours.
[02:02:06.722 --> 02:02:07.862]  There's just too much to do.
[02:02:08.702 --> 02:02:20.047]  And I think my sense of it, not having talked to Julia directly, is that what she's most reacting to, her knee-jerk reaction, is to the violence that she personally can't stomach it.
[02:02:20.868 --> 02:02:26.710]  But that's like the pagans who call me and say there wasn't human sacrifice in Europe.
[02:02:27.391 --> 02:02:30.152]  Our religion doesn't have that at its roots, and I'm sorry it does.
[02:02:30.934 --> 02:02:32.275]  And I'm just tired of denial.
[02:02:32.315 --> 02:02:34.117]  And this is childlike denial.
[02:02:34.157 --> 02:02:35.038]  We'll be right back.
[02:02:35.098 --> 02:02:35.898]  Long segment coming up.
[02:02:35.919 --> 02:02:37.320]  Plenty of time to get into Apocalypto.
[02:02:37.940 --> 02:02:40.963]  Mel Gibson, deeply involved in the film, obviously.
[02:02:41.003 --> 02:02:43.105]  She tells you some behind-the-scenes stories as well.
[02:02:48.234 --> 02:02:51.396]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[02:02:51.736 --> 02:02:53.697]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[02:02:54.057 --> 02:03:01.721]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:03:02.381 --> 02:03:09.445]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:03:09.845 --> 02:03:12.787]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran.
[02:03:13.167 --> 02:03:15.488]  A White House program to disseminate fake news.
[02:03:15.909 --> 02:03:16.729]  NSA spies.
[02:03:18.143 --> 02:03:21.286]  The latest 9-11 information and much, much more.
[02:03:21.566 --> 02:03:25.049]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:03:25.529 --> 02:03:27.431]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:03:27.791 --> 02:03:31.715]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:03:48.419 --> 02:03:51.300]  Where are military bases and hazardous waste sites located?
[02:03:51.540 --> 02:03:57.724]  How do you find the best area for solar, average rainfall, fish contamination advisories, and major transportation routes?

[02:04:44.694 --> 02:04:46.955]  Attention, attention everyone!
[02:04:46.975 --> 02:04:49.395]  A brand new invention just released.
[02:04:49.455 --> 02:04:53.977]  It's called Wrist Ease, the new patented portable ergonomic wrist support.
[02:04:54.557 --> 02:05:01.038]  Wrist Ease comforts your wrists from the sometimes painful tasks of typing, writing, using a mouse, or adding machine.
[02:05:01.559 --> 02:05:13.662]  Unlike most conventional wrist pads that are either attached to a mouse pad or lay flat in front of your keyboard, Wrist Ease is totally portable and ideal for laptop users and technicians who are constantly on the go.
[02:05:14.202 --> 02:05:18.004]  Wrist Ease is perfect for children doing homework or playing video games.
[02:05:18.444 --> 02:05:24.507]  Wrist Ease provides the proper comfort and support for all ages and makes a great stocking stuffer.
[02:05:24.947 --> 02:05:30.949]  Honest, Wrist Ease provides comfort for victims of carpal tunnel syndrome and other repetitive injuries.
[02:05:31.310 --> 02:05:34.171]  You can order Wrist Ease now at wristease.com.
[02:05:34.551 --> 02:05:40.834]  That's Wrist Ease, W-R-I-S-T-E-A-S-E, wristease.com.
[02:05:40.974 --> 02:05:42.735]  Once again, wristease.com.
[02:05:46.423 --> 02:05:52.468]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:05:53.069 --> 02:05:56.111]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:58.674 --> 02:06:05.980]  Governments of men and women, more often than not, engage in mass human sacrifice by war, by the great arena.
[02:06:07.427 --> 02:06:10.512]  By huge prisons and public executions.
[02:06:11.153 --> 02:06:12.315]  That's a form of sacrifice.
[02:06:12.335 --> 02:06:17.423]  There is no doubt the Iraq War, and I've said this many times, is a form of sacrifice.
[02:06:17.503 --> 02:06:20.147]  In fact, I've read, going back to the Hundred Year War between the French and British...
[02:06:20.726 --> 02:06:21.227]  We're good to go.
[02:06:40.826 --> 02:06:44.728]  Because elites know that the average person wants to wage war, even subconsciously.
[02:06:44.908 --> 02:06:45.768]  Wants to move up.
[02:06:46.048 --> 02:06:46.908]  Wants to take over.
[02:06:47.128 --> 02:06:48.029]  Wants to be dominant.
[02:06:48.249 --> 02:06:49.309]  Some people more than others.
[02:06:49.549 --> 02:06:54.751]  And so they use wars as a way to channel that energy out of the country against a foreign enemy.
[02:06:54.951 --> 02:07:09.317]  In fact, you were telling me off air last time we spoke about you guys talking to Mel Gibson and discussions of, this is just like, and he also said that on national television, this is like human sacrifice over in Iraq and what's happening there.
[02:07:10.549 --> 02:07:16.471]  Well, he did express that opinion several times as we were going through the work in the sound studio.
[02:07:17.231 --> 02:07:27.795]  We didn't have an opportunity to talk about it at length because we're just taking short breaks, but he truly believes that the war in Iraq is a kind of profane mass sacrifice.
[02:07:29.838 --> 02:07:30.879]  Well, and look at our leaders.
[02:07:30.899 --> 02:07:32.419]  Look at Bush and Skull and Bones.
[02:07:32.539 --> 02:07:33.700]  This is serious ritual.
[02:07:33.720 --> 02:07:34.740]  Look at Bohemian Grove.
[02:07:34.780 --> 02:07:39.722]  In fact, I have a mainstream news article today about huge secret societies they're now discovering all over the Western world.
[02:07:39.983 --> 02:07:48.886]  Helmut Schmidt, German Chancellor, wrote in his autobiography, Men and Powers, that, oh, I do rituals at a grove in Germany, but I love doing the rituals in California.
[02:07:48.906 --> 02:07:49.947]  That's my favorite place.
[02:07:50.487 --> 02:08:04.316]  Why do you think there's this need, especially in people that seek real power, to be involved in so much ritual, i.e., even if it's like Anton LaVey, I was watching a video clip of him the other day, and he said, oh, we don't really kill people here at the Church of Satan, we do mock sacrifices.
[02:08:05.156 --> 02:08:05.857]  Very interesting.
[02:08:06.877 --> 02:08:14.422]  Well, I think whether you do mock sacrifices or real sacrifices, one of the primary purposes of ritual is to consolidate power.
[02:08:15.737 --> 02:08:17.459]  I mean, you do it through magic.
[02:08:17.819 --> 02:08:30.431]  You do it through bringing power in from elemental sources, and you use magic to consolidate and concentrate it and channel it toward the desires of the community.
[02:08:30.971 --> 02:08:33.734]  Well, I mean, that's my point, and that's why you're here, and we appreciate you being here.
[02:08:33.774 --> 02:08:35.195]  It's not just about apocalypto.
[02:08:35.536 --> 02:08:45.205]  Mel Gibson, in his films, tries to point out real things that have happened, or to take real things and consolidate them into some type of fantasy realm so it's more easily understood.
[02:08:45.785 --> 02:08:55.895]  But sacrifice and mock sacrifice and all enrichable runs our society, but somehow in modern Western culture, you're laughed at like you're crazy if you even talk about it existing.
[02:08:57.119 --> 02:09:06.264]  Well, I think it's clear that it did exist worldwide and that in large measure human sacrifice does seem to have faded.
[02:09:06.925 --> 02:09:08.906]  I can't promise that it's not going on somewhere.
[02:09:09.586 --> 02:09:17.751]  But we have a lot of evidence that in times past, a century ago, and certainly a thousand years ago, that there was a lot of it going on.
[02:09:18.611 --> 02:09:21.733]  And I mention one purpose of it and another purpose of it
[02:09:22.848 --> 02:09:30.596]  I think it's just simply that a lot of people conceive of the relationship with God or gods as being one of giving and taking.
[02:09:30.997 --> 02:09:35.522]  That if they ask the deities for something, they give something in return.
[02:09:36.743 --> 02:09:41.609]  And a lot of people do believe that that something has to be something precious and valuable
[02:09:41.994 --> 02:09:45.335]  And the closer it is to one's own flesh and blood, the better.
[02:09:45.455 --> 02:09:46.896]  The more valuable it is.
[02:09:46.936 --> 02:09:49.457]  Well, it's like I'm a Christian and every night before dinner we say a prayer.
[02:09:49.537 --> 02:09:50.738]  I'm thanking God for the food.
[02:09:50.878 --> 02:09:51.358]  That's right.
[02:09:51.438 --> 02:09:54.679]  Well, I think that that is a spiritualization of that relationship.
[02:09:55.900 --> 02:09:59.981]  What I'm talking about in sacrifice, we're talking about, I think, two concepts.
[02:10:00.481 --> 02:10:03.503]  One is concrete and the other is spiritual.
[02:10:03.803 --> 02:10:06.504]  You concretize something or you spiritualize something.
[02:10:06.804 --> 02:10:09.905]  You're going to have a concretization of this relationship.
[02:10:10.185 --> 02:10:11.786]  You physically give something
[02:10:12.549 --> 02:10:14.931]  So it's making the spiritual realm real.
[02:10:14.951 --> 02:10:16.412]  I mean, it's bringing it into the real world.
[02:10:17.392 --> 02:10:18.793]  I guess giving your own blood.
[02:10:18.913 --> 02:10:19.874]  Giving your own blood.
[02:10:19.994 --> 02:10:22.716]  I mean, here's an example from the Native American traditions.
[02:10:23.196 --> 02:10:24.157]  It is the Sundance.
[02:10:24.237 --> 02:10:25.237]  You might be familiar with it.
[02:10:25.297 --> 02:10:26.338]  The Lakota Sundance.
[02:10:26.358 --> 02:10:26.598]  Yes.
[02:10:26.938 --> 02:10:31.841]  Where they dance around the pole, hook themselves by the chest with eagle talons.
[02:10:31.861 --> 02:10:32.542]  And get hauled up.
[02:10:32.722 --> 02:10:33.703]  Dance around the poles.
[02:10:33.723 --> 02:10:38.606]  They either get hauled up or they just simply dance and pull back on the pole until the claw pulls loose.
[02:10:38.726 --> 02:10:42.028]  Or they take strips of flesh off their arms.
[02:10:42.475 --> 02:10:48.480]  And it's an offering of one's own flesh, blood, and suffering to God for the sake of the community.
[02:10:48.521 --> 02:10:50.382]  It's a purification, isn't it?
[02:10:50.462 --> 02:10:54.126]  It is a type of purification, but it's for the benefit of the whole community.
[02:10:54.346 --> 02:10:57.909]  Don't they stop it once they have an hallucination or a vision?
[02:10:58.209 --> 02:10:59.130]  Not necessarily.
[02:10:59.691 --> 02:11:01.032]  I don't know the whole detail of it.
[02:11:01.092 --> 02:11:03.154]  First of all, women don't participate in it.
[02:11:03.194 --> 02:11:04.735]  But I have known Sundancers.
[02:11:04.795 --> 02:11:06.417]  I've talked to Sundancers about it.
[02:11:07.297 --> 02:11:16.800]  And, I mean, one of the reasons that they did it during the Vietnam War was so that their own Indian people who were over there in Vietnam could come home safely, not be killed.
[02:11:17.120 --> 02:11:20.281]  That they did it in order to have blessings upon their soldiers.
[02:11:20.661 --> 02:11:23.682]  So they use it for all kinds of reasons to serve the community.
[02:11:24.042 --> 02:11:32.044]  Now, this is something that I say, you know, if you're going to give something of yourself, well, that's a different story than taking the life of something else.
[02:11:33.176 --> 02:11:34.778]  But they share a commonality.
[02:11:35.018 --> 02:11:36.800]  It's this idea of giving something precious.
[02:11:37.381 --> 02:11:43.047]  And so I think human sacrifice and animal sacrifice originated with this idea of giving something precious.
[02:11:43.548 --> 02:11:50.716]  If you look at the story of Abraham and Isaac, for example, Abraham was asked by God to give the most precious thing of all.
[02:11:50.936 --> 02:11:52.718]  And that was his son, his firstborn son.
[02:11:54.289 --> 02:11:55.249]  And it was a test, though.
[02:11:55.309 --> 02:11:56.190]  It was a test.
[02:11:56.310 --> 02:12:01.132]  It was a test because, you know, when a push came to shove, then a substitution was made.
[02:12:01.152 --> 02:12:06.875]  There was a ram caught in a thicket and Abraham was told by an angel that the ram would serve as a substitution.
[02:12:07.375 --> 02:12:07.855]  So it...
[02:12:08.669 --> 02:12:12.973]  I think that that was the charter for animal sacrifice in the ancient Hebrew tradition.
[02:12:13.233 --> 02:12:19.799]  We were talking earlier about Jesus on the cross really ending what we think of as, at that point, modern human sacrifice.
[02:12:19.819 --> 02:12:22.722]  Then it was modern with his final sacrifice.
[02:12:23.182 --> 02:12:26.565]  Well, in the ritual sense of human sacrifice, yes, absolutely.
[02:12:26.646 --> 02:12:30.409]  I think that people who become Christians and who truly embrace Christ
[02:12:31.178 --> 02:12:40.905]  Jesus Christ as their Savior and really, really transfer that bloodlust that they have to that expiation that goes with Christ's death on the cross.
[02:12:41.726 --> 02:12:45.289]  No longer have that bloodlust or want to channel it toward human sacrifice.
[02:12:45.349 --> 02:12:57.078]  Now, this may be stepping on a few toes, but if you look at the Crusades or you look at the Inquisition, you can see that even a church built around this very pure and beautiful idea
[02:12:57.763 --> 02:13:11.874]  You know, we have that bloodlust, and even though we may feel it's contained within an institution that's built upon this pure transformation, that we still, at the edges, have the ability to have it fall apart.
[02:13:11.894 --> 02:13:20.201]  Well, I think it's about the cult of power that Orwell writes about in 1984, where O'Brien's torturing Winston, and he says, we are the priests of power.
[02:13:20.621 --> 02:13:23.904]  And really, I think human sacrifice, once it grew from just...
[02:13:24.384 --> 02:13:24.805]  We're good to go.
[02:13:40.802 --> 02:13:47.404]  Well, and I still think that there's an important line to be drawn between giving something directly of oneself, one's own person, one's own body.
[02:13:47.884 --> 02:13:49.564]  You can do it through ascetic practices.
[02:13:49.604 --> 02:13:59.347]  You can do it through the sweat lodge, for example, which is something I've participated in where you go and sit with the community people and just sweat and sweat and sweat until you can hardly stand it anymore.
[02:13:59.667 --> 02:14:01.207]  And you pray and smoke the pipe.
[02:14:01.688 --> 02:14:04.908]  And there is a tradition within the sweat lodge of giving flesh as well.
[02:14:04.948 --> 02:14:07.069]  I've never done that, but I understand it.
[02:14:08.271 --> 02:14:13.772]  I think that that's on one side of the line, and taking the life of something else is on the other side.
[02:14:14.153 --> 02:14:17.133]  And yet, I do see that there's a bridge between them, psychologically.
[02:14:17.513 --> 02:14:21.014]  And I understand how one is a step away from the other.
[02:14:21.394 --> 02:14:28.496]  How did it develop from all your studies, from the societies 4,000 or 5,000 years ago in Mesoamerica?
[02:14:28.776 --> 02:14:32.317]  How did it grow up to the Aztecs sacrificing thousands at a pop?
[02:14:32.765 --> 02:14:40.067]  Well, I can only guess that it's just, you know, when bloodlust still exists and it cannot be spiritualized.
[02:14:40.127 --> 02:14:51.390]  In other words, the tradition is simply to maintain it concretized and as the population grows and as the need grows, and here we have a situation of a very large population.
[02:14:52.350 --> 02:14:55.030]  In the case of the Aztecs, an expansionist population.
[02:14:55.070 --> 02:14:57.451]  I mean, they were into empire building.
[02:14:58.058 --> 02:14:59.359]  They wanted to conquer territory.
[02:14:59.399 --> 02:15:00.560]  They wanted to conquer other people.
[02:15:00.640 --> 02:15:02.522]  And empires tend to be the most bloody societies.
[02:15:02.542 --> 02:15:07.766]  They wanted to take tribute from everywhere that they could conquer or make their influence known.
[02:15:08.766 --> 02:15:11.028]  And so their needs grew as well.
[02:15:11.949 --> 02:15:26.140]  And in the case of very large populations, who are very dependent upon sunshine and rain to grow their crops, friendly relationships between themselves and the supernatural is more and more vital.
[02:15:26.559 --> 02:15:32.904]  As the population gets larger and larger, because they become more vulnerable to any failure of those things.
[02:15:33.024 --> 02:15:47.696]  So if you have, for example, a drought and too much sun and the crops dry up, and you don't look at it as a scientific issue, but you look at it as an out-of-balance supernatural issue, then you're going to have to come up with some solution that propitiates the gods.
[02:15:47.756 --> 02:15:49.117]  And I really think that it's got to be
[02:15:49.955 --> 02:15:54.917]  Well, my personal view about global warming, and I don't consider myself an expert, is that there must be a very strong natural underpinning to it.
[02:15:54.977 --> 02:15:57.018]  But there's no doubt that we also contribute to it as human beings.
[02:15:57.038 --> 02:15:57.318]  Because
[02:16:14.972 --> 02:16:19.295]  Human beings are, you know, we're... But a lot more than cars is just impervious cover.
[02:16:20.016 --> 02:16:20.216]  Yep.
[02:16:20.236 --> 02:16:22.398]  I mean, the heat sink of concrete.
[02:16:22.698 --> 02:16:23.198]  Absolutely.
[02:16:23.278 --> 02:16:24.720]  And that's just scientific studies.
[02:16:25.020 --> 02:16:26.941]  And it's also what we do to our rivers, you know.
[02:16:27.021 --> 02:16:42.053]  Just as an aside from global warming, it's what happens in the way that we develop rivers such that when we do get a lot of rain, then those rivers are out of control because the rainwater doesn't have a chance to soak into the surrounding areas.
[02:16:42.978 --> 02:16:46.343]  Earth, it just creates flooding downstream.
[02:16:47.004 --> 02:16:52.192]  We're kind of a bull in a china shop in the way in which we deal with our environment.
[02:16:52.232 --> 02:16:53.354]  There's no question about that.
[02:16:53.414 --> 02:16:55.597]  We need to wake up about all of those things.
[02:16:56.409 --> 02:16:58.511]  And become more environmentally sensitive.
[02:16:59.151 --> 02:16:59.711]  Absolutely.
[02:16:59.731 --> 02:17:01.152]  We're going to break here in a moment.
[02:17:01.172 --> 02:17:04.955]  When we get back, let's get into Apocalypto, what you did, making sure that the language is correct.
[02:17:04.975 --> 02:17:06.276]  I want to go over some of that language.
[02:17:06.736 --> 02:17:09.218]  And then I know there's several other issues you want to discuss.
[02:17:09.598 --> 02:17:12.680]  Also, I want to talk about the Mayans that did see this film.
[02:17:12.720 --> 02:17:14.121]  Mel Gibson showed it to Mayan groups.
[02:17:14.561 --> 02:17:16.102]  He showed it to Native American groups.
[02:17:16.142 --> 02:17:17.263]  He showed it to diverse groups.
[02:17:17.523 --> 02:17:18.244]  And they liked it.
[02:17:19.044 --> 02:17:21.366]  And didn't see bad.
[02:17:21.406 --> 02:17:22.847]  Didn't think it was showing them as bad.
[02:17:23.907 --> 02:17:28.871]  Just thought that it was showing a culture and then showing different elements of that culture.
[02:17:29.311 --> 02:17:32.673]  And then we'll discuss the parts that are accurate, the parts that you think are inaccurate.
[02:17:33.053 --> 02:17:36.555]  On the other side of this quick break with Barbara McLeod, our guest.
[02:17:36.615 --> 02:17:39.197]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
[02:17:39.217 --> 02:17:42.979]  The websites are Infowars.com, Infowars.net, and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:17:45.490 --> 02:17:46.511]  Ted Anderson for Midas.
[02:17:46.551 --> 02:17:47.191]  December 21st, 2006.
[02:17:47.651 --> 02:17:47.951]  Gold, 621.20.
[02:17:47.991 --> 02:17:49.332]  One ounce gold coins are at 640.76.
[02:17:49.372 --> 02:17:49.652]  322.93 for half.
[02:17:49.672 --> 02:17:50.653]  161.47 for quarter ounce coins at 640.76.
[02:17:50.693 --> 02:17:50.773]  322.93 and 161.47.
[02:18:00.978 --> 02:18:02.839]  1971, Nixon closes the gold window.
[02:18:02.919 --> 02:18:03.739]  Fiat currency.
[02:18:04.520 --> 02:18:08.361]  1920s, the German mark explodes from 75 to 23 trillion.
[02:18:08.681 --> 02:18:10.562]  1995, gold doubles against the Mexican peso.
[02:18:11.302 --> 02:18:15.304]  1997, gold increases 82% over the Indonesian rupee.
[02:18:15.324 --> 02:18:17.324]  1998, gold jumps two-thirds over the Russian ruble.
[02:18:17.504 --> 02:18:20.906]  2002, the Argentine peso loses a fifth of its value to gold.
[02:18:20.926 --> 02:18:26.308]  2006, the last superpower, the USA's mighty dollar, loses over half to gold and other raw goods.
[02:18:26.468 --> 02:18:27.768]  Could government let this happen?
[02:18:27.888 --> 02:18:29.849]  Without immediate backing, how much will it lose?
[02:18:30.129 --> 02:18:37.174]  Midas has Nick Barashev's report covering the loss of purchasing power, fat tail events, bull market economic vulnerabilities, and gold-oil relationship.
[02:18:37.194 --> 02:18:38.935]  You've lost half of your purchasing power.
[02:18:38.995 --> 02:18:40.156]  Call 800-686-2237 before the rest disappears.
[02:18:40.176 --> 02:18:40.476]  That's 800-686-2237.
[02:18:45.859 --> 02:18:46.620]  Terrorism.
[02:18:46.780 --> 02:18:47.520]  Terrorism.
[02:18:47.640 --> 02:18:48.461]  Chemical attacks.
[02:18:48.541 --> 02:18:49.201]  Dirty bombs.
[02:18:49.301 --> 02:18:49.702]  Fallout.
[02:18:49.802 --> 02:18:50.803]  Biological attack.
[02:18:50.983 --> 02:18:51.503]  Anthrax.
[02:18:51.583 --> 02:18:53.685]  And to top it all off, duct tape and plastic.
[02:18:53.945 --> 02:18:55.546]  Alarming words for our time.
[02:18:55.786 --> 02:18:58.268]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[02:18:58.668 --> 02:19:13.238]  The video, Sheltering in Place, Surviving Acts of Terrorism from Biological, Chemical, and Radioactive Fallout, was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[02:19:13.258 --> 02:19:13.579]  government.
[02:19:13.759 --> 02:19:15.540]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[02:19:15.920 --> 02:19:21.845]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[02:19:21.985 --> 02:19:26.469]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video sheltering in place.
[02:19:26.729 --> 02:19:33.455]  Get the critical information you need now for only $29 plus shipping by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[02:19:33.515 --> 02:19:36.157]  That's 888-803-4438 or order on the web at murkywater.com.
[02:19:45.755 --> 02:19:48.198]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:19:48.679 --> 02:20:02.837]  Did you know that communism has stated that America would not jump from capitalism to communism, but our elected leaders would pass laws to socialize America, and one day we would wake up and have socialism-communism and not even know how it happened?
[02:20:03.613 --> 02:20:04.153]  We're good to go.
[02:20:04.173 --> 02:20:04.353]  I think?
[02:20:25.200 --> 02:20:26.661]  Just call our toll-free number 1-800-516-8736.
[02:20:26.681 --> 02:20:27.821]  That's 1-800-516-8736 for your subscription.
[02:20:27.841 --> 02:20:28.461]  Call now.
[02:20:28.501 --> 02:20:31.002]  Operators are standing by to receive your call.
[02:20:44.904 --> 02:20:46.506]  The statistics are heart-wrenching.
[02:20:46.826 --> 02:20:55.437]  According to the CWC, of the 43 million people who have served in the major wars, from the Revolutionary War to the Gulf War, 3 million never made it home alive.
[02:20:55.777 --> 02:21:01.504]  Most likely, each one of us can say we either knew someone who served, or know a brave soul who is currently serving our country.
[02:21:01.904 --> 02:21:09.331]  Now there is a unique way to pay tribute to the courageous men and women who spend their lives protecting our freedom, and to those who have lost their lives doing so.
[02:21:09.672 --> 02:21:15.037]  Davis Products is offering high-quality, solid-cast aluminum memorial markers for your American flag.
[02:21:15.337 --> 02:21:19.261]  Each memorial marker is specifically designed to represent one of 15 wars.
[02:21:19.561 --> 02:21:25.767]  All markers include a 3-8 inch pointed and threaded aluminum rod, painted and highlighted for an appearance that is unforgettable.
[02:21:26.047 --> 02:21:26.527]  We're good to go.
[02:22:03.223 --> 02:22:14.246]  Before this hour ends in about 36 minutes, we will take just a few calls that are specifically about Apocalypto or about anthropology at 1-800-259-9231.
[02:22:15.286 --> 02:22:18.427]  But specifically on topic, on issue, please, callers.
[02:22:18.947 --> 02:22:20.767]  Barbara McLeod, anthropologist, works on Apocalypto.
[02:22:20.807 --> 02:22:23.548]  Let's get into Apocalypto and let's get into some of the behind-the-scenes stuff.
[02:22:24.548 --> 02:22:24.888]  Okay.
[02:22:24.928 --> 02:22:28.569]  Well, first of all, I worked on Apocalypto this fall.
[02:22:29.592 --> 02:22:37.114]  My first trip to Los Angeles was in the middle of September, and my fourth trip was at the beginning of November.
[02:22:37.914 --> 02:22:48.237]  And I know they wrapped up all of their post-production stuff about the middle of November, and I was on call here in Austin during that period until they actually turned it all over to Disney, who distributed it.
[02:22:48.298 --> 02:22:49.578]  So they went right up to the wire.
[02:22:49.718 --> 02:22:53.319]  They sure did, and I think that they would have liked to have more time.
[02:22:53.746 --> 02:23:01.508]  So they were really scrambling during that last phase, and we were doing 10, 12-hour days during that period because there was just so much to be done.
[02:23:01.828 --> 02:23:06.349]  They brought in all the principal actors, brought them in from all over.
[02:23:06.869 --> 02:23:15.591]  A lot of them were living in Canada or elsewhere in the United States, and they had everybody in, including Rudy Youngblood, who is the star of the film.
[02:23:16.031 --> 02:23:17.232]  And he's from Texas.
[02:23:17.292 --> 02:23:18.812]  He's originally from Belton, Texas.
[02:23:19.272 --> 02:23:20.612]  Now he's living in Los Angeles.
[02:23:20.753 --> 02:23:22.553]  Most of the folks are from Mexico.
[02:23:23.494 --> 02:23:26.495]  There's a lot of them from Mexico, but there are several of them who are living in Canada.
[02:23:26.555 --> 02:23:26.855]  Toronto.
[02:23:26.876 --> 02:23:28.716]  Like Zero Wolf, a really scary guy.
[02:23:29.096 --> 02:23:31.117]  Raul Trujillo lives in Toronto.
[02:23:31.377 --> 02:23:32.358]  I'm pretty sure it's Toronto.
[02:23:32.638 --> 02:23:33.618]  He's good.
[02:23:33.818 --> 02:23:34.599]  He's very good.
[02:23:34.639 --> 02:23:37.700]  He's been in a number of other films playing Native American people.
[02:23:37.740 --> 02:23:44.443]  He was in New World, and he was in Black Robe, which was a really interesting film that came out about, I don't know, 20 years ago now.
[02:23:45.543 --> 02:23:47.784]  And, you know, they're all really great people.
[02:23:47.824 --> 02:23:52.886]  I had a great interaction with all the principal actors, and I really like and respect them all.
[02:23:54.063 --> 02:24:00.468]  Then they brought in a lot of other actors, people that just, you know, were hired for a show to come in and do voiceovers.
[02:24:00.648 --> 02:24:03.831]  And this is Mel Gibson going back and trying to get the language just right.
[02:24:04.980 --> 02:24:07.260]  Doing the best he can to get the language just right.
[02:24:07.300 --> 02:24:17.123]  Now, I was there to try to nitpick about the language, and if it had been my druthers, I would have nitpicked a little more, but we were dealing with a serious time constraint.
[02:24:17.223 --> 02:24:17.803]  Absolutely.
[02:24:18.303 --> 02:24:28.865]  But my job, since they were doing overdubs anyway, and the main reason was not so much that the language wasn't pronounced correctly, but that they had bad audio from the original production.
[02:24:29.614 --> 02:24:37.282]  And some of it had to do with the fact that there was just distortion or noise on top of the dialogue that they couldn't get out.
[02:24:37.442 --> 02:24:38.163]  They were out in the jungle.
[02:24:38.203 --> 02:24:45.310]  They had a speedboat nearby in one case when they were filming some of the critical dialogue, and they just couldn't wipe it out.
[02:24:45.350 --> 02:24:46.131]  They couldn't get rid of it.
[02:24:47.232 --> 02:24:53.438]  Or they just had bad audio, or in some cases they didn't feel, Mel didn't feel that they had adequate emotion.
[02:24:54.008 --> 02:24:54.549]  We're good to go.
[02:25:15.751 --> 02:25:20.372]  Well, the actors would overdub those lines again and again and again.
[02:25:21.313 --> 02:25:24.334]  And first of all, they would have to lip sync them.
[02:25:24.354 --> 02:25:31.336]  And there's a method in ADR, automatic dialogue replacement, where they cue you so that you know when you start.
[02:25:31.896 --> 02:25:35.277]  And it's visual and auditory, the method that they use to cue people.
[02:25:35.317 --> 02:25:39.358]  Of course, people that have a lot of acting experience are good at lip syncing.
[02:25:39.918 --> 02:25:43.441]  But then they can digitize it and lock it in more precisely.
[02:25:43.481 --> 02:25:45.362]  It's very interesting to have audio, digital, and video.
[02:25:45.382 --> 02:25:45.922]  Yeah, you can't tell.
[02:25:45.942 --> 02:25:46.763]  They did a great job.
[02:25:46.963 --> 02:25:47.864]  They did a great job.
[02:25:47.904 --> 02:25:48.424]  They really did.
[02:25:48.484 --> 02:25:52.967]  But what he wanted to see and feel was the emotion in the voice.
[02:25:53.448 --> 02:25:57.471]  And that was the primary reason that we repeated and repeated and repeated.
[02:25:58.271 --> 02:26:01.013]  Is that he was just there thinking, hmm, that's too flat.
[02:26:01.273 --> 02:26:02.534]  Or that's too loud.
[02:26:02.654 --> 02:26:04.576]  Or that doesn't quite fit with the...
[02:26:06.772 --> 02:26:07.972]  We're good to go.
[02:26:08.032 --> 02:26:08.753]  We're good to go.
[02:26:24.426 --> 02:26:35.795]  So I was there giving linguistic cues and helping people, since we were overdubbing anyway, helping people improve the pronunciation, get some of those glottalized consonants in there.
[02:26:36.216 --> 02:26:37.817]  And also we were adding some lines.
[02:26:39.198 --> 02:26:41.180]  There were a number of lines that were added off camera.
[02:26:41.260 --> 02:26:48.406]  If actors were not facing the camera, then we could have them saying new things that kind of helped to fill in some gaps in the story.
[02:26:49.066 --> 02:26:53.529]  And I should also say that I was working with a young Yucatec man who lives in Los Angeles.
[02:26:53.889 --> 02:26:55.310]  His name was Nicolas Pott.
[02:26:56.091 --> 02:26:58.772]  And Nicolas and I, I think we became friends.
[02:26:58.832 --> 02:26:59.413]  We hit it off.
[02:26:59.453 --> 02:27:00.854]  We really liked working together.
[02:27:01.354 --> 02:27:03.535]  And so I consider us a team.
[02:27:03.555 --> 02:27:06.437]  It was Barb McLeod and Nicolas Pott, or vice versa.
[02:27:06.757 --> 02:27:10.820]  We were the Yucatec language consultant team for the ADR.
[02:27:11.664 --> 02:27:12.305]  Well, stay there.
[02:27:12.325 --> 02:27:21.111]  We're going to break, and I want to come back, and you're going to read two different scenes or subparts of scenes directly from the script in English, then in Yucatec.
[02:27:21.591 --> 02:27:23.312]  And this is amazing stuff.
[02:27:23.332 --> 02:27:32.579]  And then some more behind-the-scenes stories about the post-production of the film Apocalypto, still number one in the theaters, last time I checked, going into its third week.
[02:27:35.561 --> 02:27:36.461]  We're on the march.
[02:27:36.942 --> 02:27:38.443]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.438 --> 02:27:42.240]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.924 --> 02:27:52.349]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network and I have an urgent message for our listeners.
[02:27:52.769 --> 02:27:57.533]  The mass media keeps telling us that we are the richest, most powerful economy in the world.
[02:27:57.913 --> 02:28:00.556]  If this is true, why can't we pay our bills?
[02:28:01.036 --> 02:28:04.379]  Why is the United States the world's largest debtor nation?
[02:28:05.197 --> 02:28:09.520]  The truth is that we are in the worst debt bubble in our nation's history.
[02:28:09.981 --> 02:28:13.143]  When the bubble bursts, will you be able to feed your family?
[02:28:13.764 --> 02:28:16.586]  When the inevitable crash occurs, will you be ready?
[02:28:17.364 --> 02:28:19.525]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.
[02:28:19.545 --> 02:28:21.306]  That's 1-888-892-6238 for the following two free reports.
[02:28:21.326 --> 02:28:21.426]  U.S.
[02:28:21.526 --> 02:28:23.748]  Debt Bubble Red Alert and Real Estate Crash.
[02:28:23.768 --> 02:28:24.048]  Call 1-888-8XANADU.
[02:28:24.068 --> 02:28:25.248]  That's 1-888-8XANADU.
[02:28:25.268 --> 02:28:26.069]  Ask for George.
[02:28:44.989 --> 02:28:48.131]  Do you know the secret to reading 1,000% faster?
[02:28:48.551 --> 02:28:49.131]  That's right.
[02:28:49.351 --> 02:28:53.834]  The secret that could allow you to read 10 books in the time it takes others to read one.
[02:28:54.294 --> 02:28:57.476]  Hi, I'm Steve Glick, CEO of Infinite Mind.
[02:28:57.776 --> 02:29:02.438]  I'd like to send you a free demo of this secret, developed by a leading expert in brain function.
[02:29:02.879 --> 02:29:05.760]  Experience with this free demo the secret to reading 1,000% faster.
[02:29:07.461 --> 02:29:08.061]  We're good to go.
[02:29:31.608 --> 02:29:32.690]  Are you concerned about the
[02:29:46.345 --> 02:29:46.745]  We're good to go.
[02:30:05.894 --> 02:30:06.435]  We're good to go.
[02:30:26.994 --> 02:30:27.694]  I've been so busy.
[02:30:57.310 --> 02:31:01.814]  The last few years making other films, I've never gotten my first seven documentaries on DVD.
[02:31:03.074 --> 02:31:19.207]  Well, now, Matrix of Evil, Comprehensive Annual Financial Reports Exposed, The Masters of Terror, America Destroyed by Design, my first film, made in 97, and the Police State Trilogy, three DVDs, Police State 2000, Police State 2, The Takeover, Police State 3, Total Enslavement.
[02:31:19.667 --> 02:31:25.832]  They are all on one... in one box now.
[02:31:26.886 --> 02:31:29.907]  They're all there in one place for you.
[02:31:30.767 --> 02:31:33.128]  And so you kept asking for them on DVD.
[02:31:33.308 --> 02:31:33.928]  Here they are.
[02:31:34.549 --> 02:31:35.109]  They're ready.
[02:31:35.509 --> 02:31:46.212]  They're available at Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com via the SafeSecure online shopping cart or by calling toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[02:31:47.173 --> 02:31:51.254]  We also have my new film, Terror Storm, The History of Government-Sponsored Terror, exposed.
[02:31:52.066 --> 02:31:57.531]  And it has 68 minutes of extras from the 9-11 Neoconogenesis Symposium on 9-11 in L.A.
[02:31:57.952 --> 02:31:59.433]  on the roughly two-hour film.
[02:31:59.974 --> 02:32:06.199]  And, of course, we carry America, Freedom to Fascism, a lot of other great books and videos, 9-11 Mysteries, Demolitions, Part 1.
[02:32:07.483 --> 02:32:08.704]  America's Secret History.
[02:32:08.924 --> 02:32:17.307]  There's a huge video bookstore and video store now on InfoWars.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[02:32:18.688 --> 02:32:20.228]  Don't forget PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:32:20.268 --> 02:32:26.051]  Until the end of the year, you get five plus months, almost half a year free when you sign up for a year.
[02:32:26.691 --> 02:32:27.132]  Or a month, $5.95.
[02:32:28.174 --> 02:32:38.869]  All my interviews in studio, like the one you're hearing right now, all the local TV shows, my book, Paul Watson's book, all 15 of my films, in super high bandwidth down to low bandwidth for PrisonPlanet.tv members.
[02:32:39.169 --> 02:32:40.551]  Be sure and take advantage of that now.
[02:32:42.003 --> 02:32:50.247]  Going back to my guest, and then we do have a few callers here that we'll be able to go to who are on topic as well, Demetrius and Bill and others.
[02:32:50.467 --> 02:33:04.794]  Let's continue with getting into the film, and then also some of the criticisms by some of the, I guess, liberal anthropologists, if you want to call them that, criticizing Gibson, saying it's too violent, it's scary, when in your letter you wrote to us,
[02:33:05.314 --> 02:33:09.816]  Well, there certainly is some evidence that they did things like that, that they piled them up.
[02:33:09.836 --> 02:33:14.357]  I mean, we've got archaeological evidence of platforms that are completely embellished with carved skulls.
[02:33:14.437 --> 02:33:17.118]  And I've seen, from the work that I've done in caves,
[02:33:32.779 --> 02:33:37.243]  Piles of skulls that were undoubtedly decapitation sacrifices.
[02:33:38.284 --> 02:33:39.805]  You can see that in the vertebrae of the chop.
[02:33:40.025 --> 02:33:40.546]  Absolutely.
[02:33:40.826 --> 02:33:41.367]  Absolutely.
[02:33:42.087 --> 02:33:46.271]  And you find the rest of the body with no head lying around in the cave elsewhere.
[02:33:46.331 --> 02:33:48.072]  I've seen some places like this.
[02:33:48.153 --> 02:33:53.177]  In fact, in the case of that cave, I was the first person to see all of this stuff and document it.
[02:33:53.669 --> 02:33:56.970]  I actually found the pile of skulls that they had walled off in the corner.
[02:33:57.130 --> 02:34:01.090]  Now, you told a story Sunday on the show about Mel Gibson sitting there getting his hair cut.
[02:34:01.131 --> 02:34:03.691]  He's about to go to a TV interview, and there's a young girl cutting his hair.
[02:34:03.711 --> 02:34:06.592]  She didn't get sick seeing the heart-chopping thing over and over again.
[02:34:06.612 --> 02:34:07.132]  Tell that story.
[02:34:07.332 --> 02:34:11.853]  Well, he had to get his hair cut before the first Diane Sawyer interview.
[02:34:12.773 --> 02:34:19.734]  It looked fine to me, but he felt it was too long, so he had his personal hair cutter come into the studio while he was doing his directing.
[02:34:20.634 --> 02:34:21.955]  We did not take a break for it.
[02:34:22.355 --> 02:34:23.495]  He just kept right on working.
[02:34:24.133 --> 02:34:27.354]  And she showed up and came in with all her toolkit.
[02:34:28.234 --> 02:34:30.875]  And the first thing he does is start strutting around.
[02:34:30.915 --> 02:34:33.056]  He has a hard time sitting still anyway.
[02:34:33.116 --> 02:34:34.236]  He's just a high energy guy.
[02:34:34.656 --> 02:34:40.658]  He takes off his shirt with a flourish and struts around in the studio with his shirt off, which I thought was just great.
[02:34:40.698 --> 02:34:42.019]  He's about to get his hair cut.
[02:34:42.059 --> 02:34:46.460]  Yeah, he's about to get his hair cut and she has this lovely black cape that makes me think of Zorro.
[02:34:47.040 --> 02:34:51.942]  And so he grabs this cape and wraps it around himself as he's strutting around and the cape is floating and
[02:34:52.486 --> 02:34:54.228]  Floating and swirling and swishing.
[02:34:54.688 --> 02:34:55.909]  And then he sits down in the chair.
[02:34:56.490 --> 02:35:03.857]  And she's cutting his hair as we are working through the scene with the high priest up on the temple ripping people's hearts out.
[02:35:04.838 --> 02:35:08.681]  And, of course, in that scene you don't actually see the cut.
[02:35:08.962 --> 02:35:11.104]  What you see is the knife falling.
[02:35:11.524 --> 02:35:14.147]  You hear the victim gurgling and screaming.
[02:35:14.287 --> 02:35:15.888]  The media called this the most violent ever.
[02:35:15.928 --> 02:35:16.589]  This is nothing.
[02:35:17.338 --> 02:35:24.642]  They certainly could have made it worse, and there's a lot of Hollywood stuff out there that is visually much more shocking than anything in Apocalypto.
[02:35:25.222 --> 02:35:35.167]  I think they really toned it down, and as you mentioned, there are cases of ritual torture that we know about that are documented for the ancient Maya that were not shown in the film at all.
[02:35:35.207 --> 02:35:37.469]  They could have made it a lot more graphic than they did.
[02:35:37.749 --> 02:35:41.591]  Well, the point I'm making, though, from that story is that the young girl cutting his hair didn't get upset.
[02:35:42.797 --> 02:35:45.920]  She certainly didn't miss a step in what she was doing.
[02:35:45.980 --> 02:35:47.321]  She was watching what was going on.
[02:35:47.381 --> 02:35:52.545]  She's also looking, obviously, at Mel's head, so she doesn't do a bad job.
[02:35:52.605 --> 02:35:58.470]  But she was completely exposed to the whole thing and just carried on.
[02:35:58.690 --> 02:36:00.532]  Can we tell the story about the parrot?
[02:36:01.332 --> 02:36:03.794]  Don't say what he said, or maybe we shouldn't.
[02:36:04.055 --> 02:36:05.136]  He didn't make the film.
[02:36:05.476 --> 02:36:07.658]  There was going to be a parrot in the film.
[02:36:07.678 --> 02:36:10.100]  There is a parrot in the film, actually, but all he does is go...
[02:36:10.856 --> 02:36:17.079]  Or something like that, you know, but he was going to say something else that is connected to the arrest, and I'm not sure.
[02:36:17.359 --> 02:36:24.502]  I can tell you what it was in Yucatec that the parrot was going to say, and then anybody out there that knows Yucatec can figure out what it was.
[02:36:24.602 --> 02:36:25.663]  Okay.
[02:36:25.703 --> 02:36:27.404]  The word is chuhukim.
[02:36:27.944 --> 02:36:29.245]  Chuhukim, and it was going to go...
[02:36:30.205 --> 02:36:30.985]  Chokin'!
[02:36:31.346 --> 02:36:31.966]  Chokin'!
[02:36:32.306 --> 02:36:36.248]  And I trained one of the actors to say this, you know, so it was actually recorded.
[02:36:36.268 --> 02:36:39.829]  It was recorded by a couple of different people in case they decided he... Let me give him a hint.
[02:36:39.869 --> 02:36:41.810]  It has something to do with something he said to a police officer.
[02:36:41.830 --> 02:36:42.711]  That's right, exactly.
[02:36:42.731 --> 02:36:43.451]  Okay, we're going to leave it there.
[02:36:43.471 --> 02:36:44.431]  We're going to leave it right there.
[02:36:44.471 --> 02:36:46.952]  We'll see if people can puzzle out the riddle now.
[02:36:47.092 --> 02:36:50.414]  But anyway, when the hair cutter was done and she was packing up to leave...
[02:36:51.715 --> 02:36:53.836]  Mel said, well, you know, you didn't see any of this stuff.
[02:36:53.877 --> 02:36:56.118]  This was all secret stuff.
[02:36:56.158 --> 02:37:02.924]  And I kind of chimed in and said, yeah, right, you didn't see any heads rolling down the steps or hearts being offered to the gods and things like that.
[02:37:02.964 --> 02:37:03.904]  And she just kind of laughed.
[02:37:03.964 --> 02:37:05.406]  And then we all laughed about it.
[02:37:05.446 --> 02:37:07.147]  Everybody that was in the room laughed about it.
[02:37:08.135 --> 02:37:11.637]  As, you know, and it wasn't even clear that she wasn't supposed to talk about it.
[02:37:11.677 --> 02:37:13.118]  Any other good behind-the-scenes stuff?
[02:37:13.398 --> 02:37:14.839]  Well, it was all good.
[02:37:14.859 --> 02:37:16.140]  I mean, there was a lot.
[02:37:16.180 --> 02:37:21.603]  There was just a lot of... I mean, it's no secret that Mel Gibson, his dad, has been on the show, and the family's come to some of the events.
[02:37:21.663 --> 02:37:22.744]  I've met a lot of the family.
[02:37:22.784 --> 02:37:27.306]  But, I mean, obviously Mel Gibson in a Playboy interview on The Tonight Show talked about the New World Order.
[02:37:27.326 --> 02:37:28.947]  He's made films about the New World Order.
[02:37:29.427 --> 02:37:30.988]  I mean, Mel Gibson knows all about the New World Order.
[02:37:31.028 --> 02:37:32.229]  But not just Mel Gibson.
[02:37:32.269 --> 02:37:37.172]  You said that on the set there was a lot, you know, just in the side discussions about the New World Order.
[02:37:37.799 --> 02:37:38.560]  There was a little bit.
[02:37:38.600 --> 02:37:41.122]  There wasn't time for a lot of anything.
[02:37:41.142 --> 02:37:43.204]  As long as the stories you told me sounded like a lot.
[02:37:43.764 --> 02:37:50.029]  It wasn't a lot, but it was enough to get a sense of how Mel feels about things.
[02:37:50.510 --> 02:38:06.663]  One of the other things that I contributed to, which ended up not being in the film, was that after the captives were taken and tied to those bamboo poles so they could be marched, do that forced march through the forest for a couple of days, I suggested, well, maybe we should have them shouting
[02:38:07.267 --> 02:38:08.027]  We're good to go.
[02:38:33.204 --> 02:38:38.368]  Before we read these, I also wanted to ask about the different screenings that were shown to Mayan, but go ahead.
[02:38:39.929 --> 02:38:44.733]  Just to wrap it up, I think that once they laid the score down, they decided that they couldn't really use that material.
[02:38:45.934 --> 02:38:57.144]  There were other things that I helped develop that ended up not being used, and I really think it has to do with just the competition with the score, and they decided that the score should just dominate.
[02:38:57.304 --> 02:38:58.625]  And it's already a jam-packed movie.
[02:38:59.085 --> 02:38:59.946]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:38:59.986 --> 02:39:02.887]  I mean, it's just sumptuous, visually and auditorially.
[02:39:03.267 --> 02:39:06.989]  There's no empty space in it at all.
[02:39:07.690 --> 02:39:16.194]  And that's one of the things that's so stimulating about it, and I think that's one of the things that has, in fact, angered the people who don't like it, is because they still are sucked into it.
[02:39:16.374 --> 02:39:17.775]  Well, exactly.
[02:39:17.855 --> 02:39:22.497]  I mean, I've been on my TV show, and we've been talking about the Aztecs cutting out hearts to minds.
[02:39:22.537 --> 02:39:25.539]  I get a call going, you're a liar, that's colonial propaganda.
[02:39:25.859 --> 02:39:36.841]  They didn't do that, but I've been to Chichen Itza with a ball-playing court with hundreds of skulls carved in, and the Mayan archaeology professor who's giving the big tour says, oh, yes, of course they killed, blah, blah, blah.
[02:39:37.021 --> 02:39:40.122]  But then you get up here, and there's almost like a cover-up going on.
[02:39:40.502 --> 02:39:44.983]  Well, I haven't read Julia's article in a while.
[02:39:45.003 --> 02:39:45.763]  It's been a few days.
[02:39:46.303 --> 02:39:47.644]  But she does mention, I believe.
[02:39:47.704 --> 02:39:48.444]  No, no, no, she doesn't.
[02:39:48.464 --> 02:39:49.504]  I'm talking about other people.
[02:39:49.524 --> 02:39:50.404]  But there are other people.
[02:39:50.464 --> 02:39:52.665]  I mean, I know there are people out there who try to deny it.
[02:39:54.326 --> 02:39:55.007]  What can I say?
[02:39:55.027 --> 02:40:03.733]  But then you've got a t-shirt from a big meeting you guys had, and it's got heart chopping right on the cover with some green demon coming out.
[02:40:03.893 --> 02:40:08.696]  This is straight out of one of the Maya Screenfold books from the Post-Classic.
[02:40:08.756 --> 02:40:10.197]  Can you hold it more that way for the camera, thanks?
[02:40:10.418 --> 02:40:10.878]  How's that?
[02:40:11.458 --> 02:40:12.039]  Yeah, that's pretty good.
[02:40:12.099 --> 02:40:13.300]  A little bit lower more that way.
[02:40:13.480 --> 02:40:14.100]  There you go.
[02:40:14.120 --> 02:40:14.400]  All right.
[02:40:14.701 --> 02:40:14.941]  Got it?
[02:40:15.501 --> 02:40:16.042]  We do, yes.
[02:40:16.062 --> 02:40:16.362]  Thank you.
[02:40:16.662 --> 02:40:17.082]  Okay.
[02:40:17.122 --> 02:40:22.206]  Well, this is a scene straight out of one of the Screenfold books from the Post-Classic, the books that are called Codices.
[02:40:22.856 --> 02:40:28.390]  And it shows an altar with a sacrificial victim bent over it, all tied, hands and feet tied.
[02:40:29.102 --> 02:40:33.344]  And his belly torn open because that's the way they actually got to the heart.
[02:40:33.504 --> 02:40:34.884]  Didn't go to the ribcage, went under.
[02:40:34.904 --> 02:40:35.905]  Right, they went underneath.
[02:40:36.345 --> 02:40:42.087]  And then out of the gaping hole in his chest grows a tree with a bird sitting on it.
[02:40:42.107 --> 02:40:46.408]  And that motif is actually found from the pre-classic all the way down through the post-classic.
[02:40:46.869 --> 02:40:51.150]  And it's a manifestation of this idea of giving something and getting something back.
[02:40:51.170 --> 02:40:53.291]  Well, see, talk about inkblots.
[02:40:53.511 --> 02:40:54.892]  To me, that looks like a big green demon.
[02:40:54.932 --> 02:40:55.672]  Now I know it's a tree.
[02:40:56.152 --> 02:40:57.513]  Right, it's a tree, exactly.
[02:40:57.613 --> 02:41:03.856]  It's probably a ceiba tree, which is one of the most important and dominant trees in the forest there.
[02:41:04.316 --> 02:41:11.260]  And that bird, we call him the principal bird deity, he's found throughout Maya history that we are able to document.
[02:41:11.460 --> 02:41:19.003]  And the murals, in fact, you made reference to the pre-classic murals that are somewhat copied in the film as they walk through the tunnels.
[02:41:19.684 --> 02:41:22.105]  There's a recent discovery of some just amazing murals
[02:41:22.597 --> 02:41:25.339]  Pre-classic murals from northeastern Guatemala.
[02:41:25.379 --> 02:41:26.839]  The site is called San Bartolo.
[02:41:27.200 --> 02:41:31.142]  Anybody that's interested in the Maya should definitely check out San Bartolo.
[02:41:31.182 --> 02:41:33.543]  Just Google it and you'll find some of that stuff.
[02:41:33.623 --> 02:41:37.005]  Were the Aztecs in massive decline when Cortes arrived?
[02:41:37.705 --> 02:41:38.346]  No, they weren't.
[02:41:38.406 --> 02:41:41.107]  They were in the process of building their empire.
[02:41:41.147 --> 02:41:42.648]  They'd conquered their neighboring people.
[02:41:42.788 --> 02:41:44.429]  What about the whole civilization itself?
[02:41:44.929 --> 02:41:52.093]  Well, you know, I think that as far as I can tell, you know, you look at the scale on which they practiced human sacrifice...
[02:41:52.625 --> 02:42:04.557]  And you look at the concentrations of people, I can't say that they were in a state of environmental decline that's depicted in Apocalypto, because they seem to have it pretty well together as far as I know.
[02:42:05.178 --> 02:42:12.085]  But they were also definitely conquering people all over Mexico and down into Central America.
[02:42:12.105 --> 02:42:15.669]  Before we run out of time, let's go through this in Ukatech.
[02:42:16.633 --> 02:42:21.435]  Okay, well, what I have here is the text of the speech of the high priest.
[02:42:21.475 --> 02:42:24.777]  This is the sacrificing priest up on the temple in Apocalypto.
[02:42:25.197 --> 02:42:27.719]  And it'll give you some idea of what the rationale is.
[02:42:28.139 --> 02:42:37.223]  Now, this isn't taken straight from a Maya document, but I know that there were Maya people and a Maya archaeologist involved in writing this piece of text.
[02:42:37.403 --> 02:42:44.547]  I was not involved in writing it, but I was involved in helping the actor pronounce it again when we did the overdubs.
[02:42:45.253 --> 02:42:49.776]  But just let me read part of it quickly to you in English, and then I'll give you the Yucatec.
[02:42:50.136 --> 02:42:51.977]  These are the days of our great lament.
[02:42:52.578 --> 02:42:53.958]  The land thirsts.
[02:42:54.579 --> 02:42:57.341]  A great plague infests our crops.
[02:42:58.061 --> 02:43:01.723]  The scourge of sickness humiliates us at whim.
[02:43:02.384 --> 02:43:07.867]  They say this painful thing has made us weak, that we have become empty.
[02:43:08.408 --> 02:43:10.029]  They say that we rot.
[02:43:10.589 --> 02:43:13.831]  Great people of the banner of the sun, I say we are strong.
[02:43:14.281 --> 02:43:15.221]  We are chosen.
[02:43:15.661 --> 02:43:18.202]  Chosen to be the masters of time.
[02:43:18.942 --> 02:43:21.683]  And so, this is the beginning of this prayer.
[02:43:21.723 --> 02:43:23.184]  Let me just read it to you in Yucatec.
[02:43:23.224 --> 02:43:26.805]  Now, he's saying this to the people.
[02:43:26.825 --> 02:43:29.005]  There's a throng of thousands of people down below.
[02:43:29.425 --> 02:43:31.466]  But he's also saying it to the God.
[02:43:31.506 --> 02:43:36.427]  And the God who's named here in a little bit is Ukulkan, the feathered serpent.
[02:43:36.968 --> 02:43:39.748]  Bechlai ukinilob yah yawato'op.
[02:43:40.609 --> 02:43:41.709]  Uk'ah luma.
[02:43:42.389 --> 02:43:44.130]  That means they say we rot.
[02:43:44.150 --> 02:43:46.151]  That's what that means.
[02:44:09.659 --> 02:44:11.162]  We are the chosen ones.
[02:44:11.442 --> 02:44:13.806]  Chosen to be the masters of time.
[02:44:22.444 --> 02:44:28.650]  Now, there's also some things in the film, and Mel's even talked about this publicly, that are personal things that happen to him.
[02:44:28.750 --> 02:44:33.054]  Like, one of the bad guys in the film is somebody he's attacking.
[02:44:33.114 --> 02:44:40.101]  He's calling him Almost, because the star, Jaguar Paw, almost beats him at the first of the film in a fight.
[02:44:40.121 --> 02:44:41.583]  So he tells him, you're almost...
[02:44:41.963 --> 02:44:45.626]  And that's a very common device or expression of storytellers to put part of their story together.
[02:45:01.799 --> 02:45:06.382]  Unless they're doing a documentary and trying to make it as objectively scientific as possible.
[02:45:06.622 --> 02:45:12.225]  Sure, the nitpickers, I mean, he just took a lot of real stuff combined and even put some of his own life experiences in.
[02:45:12.425 --> 02:45:13.205]  What's this next one?
[02:45:13.225 --> 02:45:15.646]  I mean, this is a good scene in the movie about not having fear.
[02:45:15.686 --> 02:45:16.067]  I like it.
[02:45:16.867 --> 02:45:17.467]  Have we got time?
[02:45:17.507 --> 02:45:18.348]  Yeah, we've got time.
[02:45:18.368 --> 02:45:19.729]  Let's do it.
[02:45:19.849 --> 02:45:20.969]  Okay, I did this on Sunday.
[02:45:20.989 --> 02:45:24.271]  I'm happy to do it again because it's really my favorite piece of the script.
[02:45:24.830 --> 02:45:35.979]  But this is the scene early on when Jaguar Paw and his friends and his father encounter a group of people passing through that part of the forest.
[02:45:36.800 --> 02:45:38.221]  And they're obviously on the run.
[02:45:38.281 --> 02:45:39.382]  They look terrified.
[02:45:39.942 --> 02:45:41.023]  Men, women, and children.
[02:45:41.423 --> 02:45:43.205]  They've obviously been through some kind of
[02:45:43.772 --> 02:45:44.153]  Battle.
[02:45:45.274 --> 02:45:49.039]  And they're trying to ask permission to pass through that part of the forest.
[02:45:49.820 --> 02:45:54.446]  And then as they depart, they've traded some meat for some fish.
[02:45:56.087 --> 02:45:59.108]  As they depart, they say, our lands were ravaged.
[02:45:59.208 --> 02:46:00.628]  And then they pass on through the forest.
[02:46:00.648 --> 02:46:02.529]  Actually, they say, our lands were ravaged.
[02:46:03.009 --> 02:46:05.690]  And then Jaguar Paw comes back with, your lands were ravaged?
[02:46:06.090 --> 02:46:08.871]  And they say, yes, we're going to go and seek a new beginning.
[02:46:09.531 --> 02:46:18.134]  And at that point, Jaguar Paw's father calls him back because he does not want him to go ahead and engage these people in this conversation.
[02:46:18.234 --> 02:46:19.914]  And hear about all the scary stuff and then let him hear.
[02:46:19.934 --> 02:46:22.275]  And hear about all the scary stuff and then bring it back to the village.
[02:46:22.335 --> 02:46:25.136]  So now he gives him this lecture about fear.
[02:46:25.891 --> 02:46:30.353]  So he says, and I'll give it to you, I'll give the English interlinearly here.
[02:46:30.373 --> 02:46:32.213]  You are troubled again.
[02:46:32.313 --> 02:46:34.754]  Those people in the forest, what did you see on them?
[02:46:34.794 --> 02:46:35.054]  Fear.
[02:46:35.074 --> 02:46:36.775]  Deep, rotting fear.
[02:46:36.815 --> 02:46:38.195]  They were infected by it.
[02:46:38.255 --> 02:46:38.655]  Did you see?
[02:46:55.376 --> 02:46:56.256]  Fear is a sickness.
[02:46:56.416 --> 02:46:58.517]  It will crawl into the soul.
[02:46:58.677 --> 02:47:00.818]  It has tainted your peace already.
[02:47:00.838 --> 02:47:03.619]  I did not raise you to see you with fear.
[02:47:03.659 --> 02:47:06.159]  Strike it from your heart.
[02:47:06.259 --> 02:47:08.260]  I did not raise you to see you with fear.
[02:47:24.841 --> 02:47:26.222]  Do not bring it into the village.
[02:47:26.903 --> 02:47:30.526]  At first light, we will gather with the elders at the sacred hill of our fathers.
[02:47:30.927 --> 02:47:33.589]  There we will call on our spirits to guide us.
[02:47:47.307 --> 02:47:52.452]  Well, I mean, it's important to study human history because if you don't know what the old cliche goes, you'll be doomed to repeat it.
[02:47:52.952 --> 02:47:57.436]  And this is a major artery, not a thread, running through human history.
[02:47:57.857 --> 02:48:01.660]  And people need to face up to what societies and establishments, i.e.
[02:48:01.800 --> 02:48:02.741]  governments, have done.
[02:48:03.081 --> 02:48:04.423]  They always become abusive.
[02:48:04.463 --> 02:48:06.204]  They always become insane.
[02:48:06.524 --> 02:48:08.887]  They always become completely dominating.
[02:48:09.327 --> 02:48:12.890]  And our own elite today is doing horrible, evil things right out in the open.
[02:48:13.110 --> 02:48:13.671]  But just like...
[02:48:13.831 --> 02:48:14.632]  We're good to go.
[02:48:14.652 --> 02:48:15.112]  I think?
[02:48:48.277 --> 02:48:51.459]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[02:48:51.800 --> 02:48:53.741]  My new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:48:54.101 --> 02:49:01.767]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:49:02.447 --> 02:49:09.512]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:49:09.892 --> 02:49:12.874]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran.
[02:49:13.235 --> 02:49:15.536]  A White House program to disseminate fake news.
[02:49:15.976 --> 02:49:16.797]  NSA spies.
[02:49:17.193 --> 02:49:19.255]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:49:19.275 --> 02:49:22.557]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:49:45.040 --> 02:49:45.801]  Terrorism.
[02:49:45.961 --> 02:49:46.701]  Terrorism.
[02:49:46.801 --> 02:49:47.642]  Chemical attacks.
[02:49:47.722 --> 02:49:48.382]  Dirty bombs.
[02:49:48.482 --> 02:49:48.883]  Fallout.
[02:49:48.983 --> 02:49:49.964]  Biological attack.
[02:49:50.144 --> 02:49:50.684]  Anthrax.
[02:49:50.764 --> 02:49:52.866]  And to top it all off, duct tape and plastic.
[02:49:53.126 --> 02:49:54.727]  Alarming words for our time.
[02:49:54.967 --> 02:49:57.429]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[02:49:57.829 --> 02:50:12.399]  The video, Sheltering in Place, Surviving Acts of Terrorism from Biological, Chemical, and Radioactive Fallout, was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[02:50:12.439 --> 02:50:12.760]  government.
[02:50:12.940 --> 02:50:14.721]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[02:50:15.101 --> 02:50:21.003]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[02:50:21.163 --> 02:50:25.624]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video sheltering in place.

[02:51:50.053 --> 02:51:51.194]  Trust your government.
[02:51:51.314 --> 02:51:52.235]  You know that it's loving.
[02:51:52.435 --> 02:51:53.837]  Government wouldn't hurt you.
[02:51:54.577 --> 02:51:55.098]  What do you mean?
[02:51:55.118 --> 02:52:01.463]  I mean, it's always government and elites murdering and killing and sacrificing and warring and enslaving.
[02:52:01.483 --> 02:52:05.967]  And we're so naive to not think that, you know, it's somehow changed today.
[02:52:06.608 --> 02:52:09.870]  Demetrius of South Carolina, you're on the air with our guest.
[02:52:10.251 --> 02:52:11.512]  Thank you for joining us.
[02:52:12.232 --> 02:52:12.513]  Thanks.
[02:52:12.533 --> 02:52:13.534]  I appreciate everything.
[02:52:13.554 --> 02:52:14.635]  Alex, I love your show.
[02:52:14.655 --> 02:52:17.317]  I just started listening like three weeks ago.
[02:52:18.067 --> 02:52:26.412]  And everything you say is scary, but I'm glad to hear it because I do believe that our government, you know, doesn't always look out for our best interests.
[02:52:27.032 --> 02:52:32.756]  And I kind of had this in the back of my head, but everything you hear makes more sense, especially the 9-11 truth movement.
[02:52:33.156 --> 02:52:36.718]  And a lot of people in my community and that I know are real ignorant about it.
[02:52:37.238 --> 02:52:45.423]  But regarding anthropology in general, there was a book I read by the author Eric Fromm, and he analyzes, like,
[02:52:45.970 --> 02:52:49.293]  The psychological side of politics and just human nature in general.
[02:52:49.953 --> 02:53:12.230]  And I would like to ask the doctor, what does she make of, like, different cultures that had killed an animal like a bear or had did sacrifices, but at the same time, after they had performed the sacrifice, they actually did a ritual to, like, kind of honor the animal that they killed as if they were... Yeah, Dr. McLeod, I mean, specifically, what is the question?
[02:53:13.572 --> 02:53:13.612]  Is...
[02:53:14.545 --> 02:53:32.261]  I mean, I know that human nature, you know, she says that there's a bloodlust, you know, but is there something, you know, from studies of ancient cultures that shows that there's also like a side of human nature that really doesn't want to kill and doesn't really enjoy it?
[02:53:32.281 --> 02:53:34.343]  Well, obviously there's a side of human nature that doesn't want to kill.
[02:53:34.363 --> 02:53:35.064]  Thanks for the call.
[02:53:35.424 --> 02:53:36.946]  Hey, thanks, Demetrius.
[02:53:37.266 --> 02:53:39.328]  Yeah, I see where you're going with that, and
[02:53:39.864 --> 02:53:44.966]  My experience with that is mostly from Native American peoples of both North America and Central America.
[02:53:45.006 --> 02:53:56.270]  There is this idea that if we have to hunt, and we do, because we are meat eaters, you know, we are biologically programmed to be omnivores.
[02:53:56.910 --> 02:53:59.151]  And so we do kill, we do take life.
[02:53:59.771 --> 02:54:02.432]  And a lot of the Native American people have a ritual.
[02:54:02.472 --> 02:54:03.813]  In fact, the ritual takes place
[02:54:04.443 --> 02:54:05.983]  Not only after, but before.
[02:54:06.023 --> 02:54:08.224]  The ritual begins as the hunt begins.
[02:54:08.264 --> 02:54:09.484]  They do a ritual for the hunt.
[02:54:09.524 --> 02:54:10.484]  And then they thank the deer.
[02:54:10.544 --> 02:54:15.965]  And they ask permission to take an animal's life, or even to take a tree down.
[02:54:16.025 --> 02:54:16.225]  Sure.
[02:54:16.425 --> 02:54:17.166]  We've got to move quick.
[02:54:17.206 --> 02:54:18.086]  Bill in Ohio.
[02:54:18.346 --> 02:54:18.926]  You're on the air.
[02:54:18.966 --> 02:54:19.506]  Last caller.
[02:54:19.546 --> 02:54:20.026]  Go ahead, Bill.
[02:54:20.046 --> 02:54:20.346]  Quickly.
[02:54:20.546 --> 02:54:21.406]  Bill in Chicago.
[02:54:22.287 --> 02:54:27.608]  What about the error correction with about three days at the end of the Mayan calendar?
[02:54:27.648 --> 02:54:31.128]  And I think it's ironic that it ends a month before, after Hillary's
[02:54:34.130 --> 02:54:36.492]  Before Hillary's term will be up.
[02:54:37.812 --> 02:54:41.375]  Well, I think it's really interesting that it's tied in with the winter solstice, too.
[02:54:41.435 --> 02:54:43.876]  I mean, I think that's the most interesting part of it.
[02:54:43.936 --> 02:54:50.901]  There's actually a two-day correction to the calendar, and it has to do with the way in which the correlation was developed
[02:54:51.608 --> 02:55:02.853]  And it was corrected when people... But let's be clear, you don't believe things end on 2012, and the actual Mayan documents that you've read from the Stone shows that they just mean a new cycle begins.
[02:55:03.133 --> 02:55:09.096]  Well, I'm one of the people that's involved in deciphering the phrase from the last time it happened, back in 3113 B.C.
[02:55:09.536 --> 02:55:16.979]  So I know what they say there, and they say, will change, or will be changed,
[02:55:17.506 --> 02:55:20.027]  The hearth at the mouth of the sky.
[02:55:20.528 --> 02:55:23.909]  And I know from other studies of my iconography... That means culture.
[02:55:24.049 --> 02:55:32.313]  They conceive of the sky as a house, as a deified house, and the hearth is the heart of culture.
[02:55:33.334 --> 02:55:43.799]  Yeah, so people running around saying, even if you believe what the Mayans are saying, and again, we don't, you know, it's their religion, it doesn't end in 2012.
[02:55:43.859 --> 02:55:44.379]  No, it doesn't.
[02:55:44.860 --> 02:55:46.541]  Something changes in 2012, but things don't end.
[02:55:47.964 --> 02:55:49.004]  All right, we're out of time.
[02:55:49.685 --> 02:55:51.565]  Dr. McLeod, I want to thank you for coming in.
[02:55:51.605 --> 02:55:53.566]  Any websites, any things we should check?
[02:55:54.386 --> 02:56:01.048]  Well, Mesoweb, M-E-S-O-W-E-B, is a great source for scholars and lay people alike.
[02:56:01.508 --> 02:56:02.629]  Just Google it.
[02:56:02.709 --> 02:56:04.509]  You also teach flying lessons here in town.
[02:56:04.569 --> 02:56:05.089]  That's right, I do.
[02:56:05.109 --> 02:56:07.510]  You're going to take us up to videotape the Trans-Texas Corridor soon.
[02:56:07.530 --> 02:56:08.130]  Tell us where you're at.
[02:56:08.651 --> 02:56:09.471]  I'm based at...
[02:56:10.786 --> 02:56:15.810]  At Bergstrom, the south end of Bergstrom, Atlantic Flight Support, and I'm with the University Flying Club.
[02:56:16.330 --> 02:56:18.052]  All right, so fantastic.
[02:56:18.232 --> 02:56:19.333]  Well, listen, thank you for coming in.
[02:56:19.773 --> 02:56:20.274]  You're welcome.
[02:56:20.354 --> 02:56:20.834]  That was great.
[02:56:21.254 --> 02:56:22.375]  All right, folks, see you back tonight.
[02:56:22.395 --> 02:56:23.076]  See you back tomorrow.
[02:56:23.096 --> 02:56:23.536]  God bless.
