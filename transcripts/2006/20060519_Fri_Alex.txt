[00:00:05.865 --> 00:00:06.525]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.186 --> 00:00:08.246]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.947 --> 00:00:10.047]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.708 --> 00:00:11.528]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.288 --> 00:00:13.169]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:17.471]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.032 --> 00:00:22.114]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:38.752 --> 00:00:39.713]  Welcome, my friends.
[00:00:39.793 --> 00:00:41.795]  It's the 19th day of May, 2006.
[00:00:42.075 --> 00:00:43.897]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:00:43.917 --> 00:00:45.439]  We'll be here for the next three hours.
[00:00:45.459 --> 00:00:47.581]  I have two important guests for you.
[00:00:48.281 --> 00:00:58.371]  One of them, coming up in 30 minutes, led a huge demonstration at Donald Rumsfeld's house with Ray McGovern and others, as well as Cindy Sheehan, asking why he lied and faked intelligence.
[00:00:58.732 --> 00:01:01.955]  And we have their own White House documents showing they premeditatedly
[00:01:02.635 --> 00:01:06.657]  Staged the intelligence against Iraq on multiple levels.
[00:01:06.677 --> 00:01:09.759]  They're now doing the exact same thing with Iran.
[00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:15.442]  General Hayden is saying they have the legal power to tap phones without warrants now.
[00:01:15.842 --> 00:01:17.983]  Repeating things he said several months ago.
[00:01:18.443 --> 00:01:24.506]  And the Associated Press is reporting he's online to be confirmed as the new CIA director very soon.
[00:01:24.927 --> 00:01:27.368]  Still running around in his Air Force uniform.
[00:01:28.672 --> 00:01:30.513]  And again, he's insisting it is all legal.
[00:01:30.553 --> 00:01:32.793]  We'll go over that today.
[00:01:34.314 --> 00:01:39.495]  At the same time, the FBI is saying it has a good lead on Jimmy Hoffa's location.
[00:01:39.595 --> 00:01:40.216]  I'm not kidding.
[00:01:40.756 --> 00:01:43.196]  This is out of the Associated Press as well.
[00:01:43.216 --> 00:01:44.077]  We'll be getting into that.
[00:01:44.557 --> 00:01:46.498]  FDA panel backs STD.
[00:01:46.578 --> 00:01:52.919]  That's sexually transmitted disease vaccine to block cancer viruses.
[00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.561]  Cancer viruses, our own government has been caught putting in vaccines.
[00:01:58.306 --> 00:02:00.488]  Bush says border fencing makes sense.
[00:02:00.548 --> 00:02:01.529]  More smoke and mirrors.
[00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:03.131]  We'll be getting into that.
[00:02:03.151 --> 00:02:12.800]  The Senate votes to extend fence along border, but to also give illegal aliens the guest worker program and to basically legalize all of them and to give them social security.
[00:02:14.232 --> 00:02:14.692]  We're good to go.
[00:02:37.672 --> 00:02:38.193]  We're good to go.
[00:02:55.365 --> 00:02:56.026]  We're good to go.
[00:03:13.499 --> 00:03:14.320]  We're good to go.
[00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:14.520]  I think?
[00:03:36.073 --> 00:03:36.713]  We're good to go.
[00:04:05.251 --> 00:04:08.613]  Soprano Star says Bush should reinstate the draft.
[00:04:08.633 --> 00:04:11.455]  That's what I'd expect from a wannabe thug.
[00:04:11.475 --> 00:04:15.717]  And at the same time, scores killed in Afghan violence.
[00:04:15.757 --> 00:04:22.521]  Up to 100 people have died in some of Afghan's fiercest fighting since the U.S.-led forces ousted the Taliban.
[00:04:22.581 --> 00:04:24.302]  It's getting a lot worse this week.
[00:04:25.203 --> 00:04:31.586]  And we'll get into that and the house blocking offshore drilling to get the United States needed oil.
[00:04:32.167 --> 00:04:34.168]  All part of that ongoing monopoly.
[00:04:34.708 --> 00:04:40.371]  We will detail all of these stories and a lot more today in the next two hours and 55 minutes.
[00:04:40.871 --> 00:04:42.132]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:04:42.172 --> 00:04:45.253]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
[00:04:47.722 --> 00:04:51.023]  We will continue to fight the New World Order at point-blank range.
[00:04:51.063 --> 00:04:53.084]  We will continue to defend liberty, resist tyranny.
[00:04:53.444 --> 00:04:55.925]  On the other side of these important messages, stand by.
[00:05:02.448 --> 00:05:05.329]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[00:05:06.039 --> 00:05:07.340]  Alex Jones here, America.
[00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:13.282]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest and most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[00:05:13.562 --> 00:05:18.804]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[00:05:19.105 --> 00:05:23.266]  Brace yourselves as the New World Order program for world domination is blown wide open.
[00:05:23.446 --> 00:05:27.208]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world where the military and the police are merged.
[00:05:27.468 --> 00:05:32.030]  Witnesses' populations beg for national ID cards and, yes, even implantable microchips.
[00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:38.433]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies, psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.
[00:05:38.493 --> 00:05:40.353]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.
[00:05:40.794 --> 00:05:42.874]  Order 911 The Road to Tyranny today.
[00:05:42.975 --> 00:05:45.556]  Call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[00:05:45.696 --> 00:05:49.377]  That's 1-888-253-3139.
[00:05:50.118 --> 00:05:54.499]  Or order online at infowars.com or infowars.net.
[00:05:54.619 --> 00:05:56.600]  You see big brothers afraid of this documentary.
[00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:58.381]  Order today and spread the word.
[00:05:58.541 --> 00:06:00.622]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.
[00:06:01.815 --> 00:06:03.436]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:06:03.556 --> 00:06:07.677]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[00:06:07.797 --> 00:06:10.678]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[00:06:10.758 --> 00:06:17.480]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:20.661]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[00:06:20.861 --> 00:06:23.241]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[00:06:23.381 --> 00:06:28.103]  Black Berkey elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove
[00:06:28.703 --> 00:06:29.223]  We're good to go.
[00:06:52.822 --> 00:06:53.362]  803-4438.
[00:06:53.982 --> 00:06:55.323]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:06:55.743 --> 00:06:59.624]  Or order on the web at murkywater.com.
[00:07:01.685 --> 00:07:03.545]  Gas prices are out of control.
[00:07:03.765 --> 00:07:07.906]  You drive up to the pump only to find that the price per gallon is up once again.
[00:07:08.266 --> 00:07:12.808]  If you want to save money at the pump and get back in the driver's seat, then listen closely.
[00:07:12.988 --> 00:07:17.449]  There is now a way to save up to 30% or more on your fuel bill using
[00:07:17.569 --> 00:07:23.813]  The MPG cap is a capsule that looks like a vitamin that you simply drop into your gas tank.
[00:07:23.933 --> 00:07:28.635]  It's organic, non-toxic, EPA approved, and can drastically reduce fuel emissions.
[00:07:28.835 --> 00:07:36.760]  People all across the nation are reporting improved performance as well as the money saving increases in their gas mileage by using our MPG caps.
[00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:41.223]  MPG caps are designed for use in all gasoline or diesel powered engines.
[00:07:41.604 --> 00:07:47.628]  And you can also have a lucrative home-based business by simply sharing this amazing money-saving product with others.
[00:07:47.768 --> 00:07:48.329]  Don't wait.
[00:07:48.429 --> 00:07:50.170]  Call MPG Biz now at 800-526-1778.
[00:07:50.190 --> 00:07:50.410]  That's 800-526-1778.
[00:07:50.430 --> 00:07:52.031]  Or visit the webpage at mpgbiz.com.
[00:07:52.071 --> 00:07:52.712]  That's mpgbiz.com.
[00:08:02.737 --> 00:08:08.758]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:09.358 --> 00:08:12.419]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:29.903]  In a few minutes, we're going to go back and one more time play that classic clip from a few months ago where General Hayden, former head of the National Security Agency, argues with a reporter and tells him that
[00:08:30.949 --> 00:08:35.173]  The Fourth Amendment says nothing about probable cause.
[00:08:36.154 --> 00:08:37.235]  So we'll cue that up.
[00:08:38.273 --> 00:09:04.134]  Because General Hayden is now saying it's totally legal for them to spy without warrants, and everything is fine, and he didn't do anything wrong, and of course the Congressional Committee that is on the verge of approving his nomination to be Central Intelligence Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, they totally agree with him, and just everything is basically wonderful because President Bush is above the law, but the American people are not buying it,
[00:09:04.414 --> 00:09:05.235]  I think we're good to go.
[00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:33.418]  We're good to go.
[00:09:52.405 --> 00:09:53.466]  Snuggly, the security bear!
[00:10:20.951 --> 00:10:22.272]  See, I'm not scary.
[00:10:22.852 --> 00:10:24.152]  I'm snuggly and secure.
[00:10:27.014 --> 00:10:30.015]  My pal here worked with the White House to spy on Americans.
[00:10:30.955 --> 00:10:33.596]  And now he just might be promoted to head the CIA.
[00:10:34.317 --> 00:10:36.577]  When people talk, General Hayden listens.
[00:10:37.638 --> 00:10:39.999]  And that makes me feel snuggly and secure.
[00:10:41.525 --> 00:10:45.307]  Americans just like you are now eligible for government snooping.
[00:10:46.327 --> 00:10:51.169]  We take hundreds of millions of your phone records and pass them on to our intelligence analysts.
[00:10:52.410 --> 00:10:54.390]  So we can all be more snuggly and secure.
[00:10:56.471 --> 00:11:04.375]  Not only do your friendly phone companies hand over your private records, some even help us build secret snooping centers right here in San Francisco.
[00:11:05.295 --> 00:11:06.355]  That's not scary.
[00:11:07.016 --> 00:11:08.336]  That's snuggly and secure.
[00:11:11.380 --> 00:11:13.621]  You're changing the face of intelligence.
[00:11:13.701 --> 00:11:19.382]  Who needs big, boring CIA strategic intelligence when you can have new and improved intel bits?
[00:11:20.383 --> 00:11:23.664]  The Pentagon and the President love them, and so do I!
[00:11:24.764 --> 00:11:27.065]  Bring Snuggly, the security bear!
[00:11:28.445 --> 00:11:29.125]  See?
[00:11:29.325 --> 00:11:30.146]  I'm not scary.
[00:11:30.646 --> 00:11:32.987]  I'm Snuggly and secure.
[00:11:34.607 --> 00:11:37.068]  We're watching you because we love you.
[00:11:43.403 --> 00:11:44.083]  That's right.
[00:11:44.344 --> 00:11:46.266]  We're watching you because we love you.
[00:11:48.778 --> 00:12:02.004]  But if you go to the border and sit there with a walkie-talkie and call the Border Patrol and you see illegal aliens pouring across or Mexican troops burning houses or shooting American citizens or police, and all of that has happened.
[00:12:02.024 --> 00:12:04.365]  We've had the border sheriffs on for you to cover it.
[00:12:04.505 --> 00:12:07.906]  They've tried to keep it quiet in the national media, but it's in the regional media.
[00:12:07.966 --> 00:12:14.069]  I'm right here in central Texas, just 150 miles from the border, and let me tell you, it's going on big time.
[00:12:16.135 --> 00:12:20.056]  And, of course, they have federal training manuals and state homeland security training manuals.
[00:12:20.656 --> 00:12:24.216]  Tattle on your neighbors, no matter what they do.
[00:12:24.937 --> 00:12:32.858]  People that wear blue jeans, people that have cell phones, people that travel with women and children, people that are polite and kind to police, individuals who make frequent references to the U.S.
[00:12:32.898 --> 00:12:34.298]  Constitution are terrorists.
[00:12:34.618 --> 00:12:38.659]  Those that have road-driving almanacs in their glove compartments may be terrorists.
[00:12:38.719 --> 00:12:44.140]  Those that are part of land rights organizations or property rights activists are terrorists.
[00:12:44.660 --> 00:12:46.021]  Homeschoolers are terrorists.
[00:12:46.041 --> 00:12:54.788]  They have terror drills where they terrorize the public school students and have the SWAT teams dressed up as fictitious homeschooling groups that are coming to kill them.
[00:12:54.828 --> 00:13:02.735]  Anytime there's any little incident, they lock down whole city schools and have men aim guns at children, training us how to all be good little prisoners.
[00:13:03.235 --> 00:13:05.577]  Face scanning and thumb scanning is to get driver's license.
[00:13:05.637 --> 00:13:06.558]  All of this is happening.
[00:13:06.938 --> 00:13:10.561]  There's control grids going in, but our borders got to be wide open.
[00:13:10.581 --> 00:13:13.944]  We're going to get into the latest developments on that here in just a few minutes.
[00:13:13.984 --> 00:13:21.010]  But first off, General Michael V. Hayden insists NSA surveillance is legal.
[00:13:21.951 --> 00:13:25.534]  And so before I get into this, guys, did you find that clip of him on MSNBC?
[00:13:26.542 --> 00:13:32.787]  Let's roll this clip one more time where he says that there is nothing in the Fourth Amendment about probable cause.
[00:13:32.847 --> 00:13:36.630]  It's all reasonable, and they decide what's reasonable.
[00:13:36.690 --> 00:13:37.130]  So roll it.
[00:13:39.087 --> 00:13:53.356]  The Fourth Amendment of the Constitution specifies that you must have probable cause to be able to do a search that does not violate an American's right against unlawful searches and seizures.
[00:13:57.479 --> 00:14:00.860]  It protects all of us against unreasonable search and seizure.
[00:14:01.141 --> 00:14:02.321]  That's what it says.
[00:14:02.341 --> 00:14:04.742]  But the measure is probable cause, I believe.
[00:14:04.762 --> 00:14:07.063]  The amendment says unreasonable search and seizure.
[00:14:07.383 --> 00:14:09.104]  But does it not say probable... No.
[00:14:09.644 --> 00:14:12.085]  The court says unreasonable search and seizure.
[00:14:12.105 --> 00:14:13.926]  The legal standard is probable cause.
[00:14:14.246 --> 00:14:23.490]  Just to be very clear, okay, and believe me, if there's any amendment to the Constitution that employees of the National Security Agency are familiar with, it's the Fourth, right?
[00:14:23.690 --> 00:14:26.731]  And it is a reasonable standard in the Fourth Amendment.
[00:14:28.035 --> 00:14:45.012]  To quote the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States in its entirety, the one the General and the NSA folks are so familiar with and know is about reasonableness and not about probable cause, quote, "...the right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures..."
[00:14:45.672 --> 00:14:49.614]  Well, maybe they have a different constitution over there at the NSA.
[00:14:49.634 --> 00:14:54.956]  That's probably the eighth time I've played that, but there's a reason I've done that in the last three months.
[00:14:54.976 --> 00:14:56.176]  I mean, this is such an insane...
[00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:20.490]  illustration and I actually went to C-SPAN and bought the entire hour-and-a-half speech and questioning and he says even more ridiculous things
[00:15:22.737 --> 00:15:23.558]  To the reporters.
[00:15:23.778 --> 00:15:41.908]  And he just lies and lies and lies, because now he has contradicted much of what he said in previous testimony to Congress, and Congress is on record saying he lied to them last year, and he is on record lying to those reporters because he's now contradicted himself in news speeches he's given.
[00:15:43.124 --> 00:15:46.286]  So what they do is they deny they're spying on you without warrants.
[00:15:46.706 --> 00:15:49.127]  Then when they get caught, they say they're allowed to.
[00:15:49.527 --> 00:15:51.728]  And that's what he told Congress again yesterday.
[00:15:51.768 --> 00:15:53.329]  I have his quotes right here.
[00:15:53.369 --> 00:15:57.651]  And this morning it was re-airing on CNN and Fox and saw him again repeating it.
[00:15:58.011 --> 00:16:01.012]  And CNN and Fox are all there telling you everything's okay.
[00:16:01.513 --> 00:16:04.214]  General Hayden's only trying to keep you safe from Al-Qaeda.
[00:16:04.754 --> 00:16:14.946]  And no, it's every phone call made in America, who you call, how long the call's made, the connection that caller has to their entire phone tree, who those people talk to.
[00:16:15.006 --> 00:16:22.675]  It's all about understanding relationships and the movement of information and what Americans are aware and what Americans will buy into.
[00:16:23.849 --> 00:16:31.237]  The NSA admittedly samples the political will of the country, engages in its own real scientific polls.
[00:16:31.317 --> 00:16:39.445]  They have computers that understand whole conversations, and then it creates digital psychological algorithms is what they term them.
[00:16:40.524 --> 00:16:49.431]  It's mainly used, of course, for spying on political movements, political ideas, and stealing different patent secrets or new technological developments.
[00:16:49.851 --> 00:16:57.037]  Key allied crime corporations that work for the New World Order are given advanced information on their competition.
[00:16:57.817 --> 00:17:09.206]  Basically, it's just used by the organized global crime syndicate to always have a heads up and always have a head start against the free people of this planet.
[00:17:10.049 --> 00:17:12.611]  It is a giant snooping system for criminals.
[00:17:13.552 --> 00:17:14.973]  Bottom line.
[00:17:16.755 --> 00:17:22.060]  And General Hayden gets up there and they're counting on the American people being stupid.
[00:17:22.961 --> 00:17:24.502]  It's like Bush's amnesty plant.
[00:17:25.123 --> 00:17:27.685]  He attaches it to putting 6,000 troops on the border.
[00:17:27.705 --> 00:17:29.246]  He says they'll only be there for a few months.
[00:17:29.526 --> 00:17:33.849]  They have lots of photo ops with armored vehicles and watchtowers being put up.
[00:17:33.889 --> 00:17:35.490]  The illegal aliens just go around it.
[00:17:35.850 --> 00:17:45.556]  Our own government admittedly for the last year has been telling the Mexican troops covertly exactly under Bush's orders to tell the Mexican troops exactly where the Minutemen are so they can just...
[00:17:46.036 --> 00:17:46.777]  We're good to go.
[00:18:08.948 --> 00:18:09.528]  We're good to go.
[00:18:09.569 --> 00:18:09.769]  I think?
[00:18:29.399 --> 00:18:32.882]  And putting a few thousand troops down there just for a couple months.
[00:18:32.902 --> 00:18:41.387]  This is on record with the total guest worker program that legalizes all illegal aliens that are in this country and anyone who can get here for six years.
[00:18:41.888 --> 00:18:43.529]  So they added some addendum on there.
[00:18:43.549 --> 00:18:47.992]  Well, if you're a felon, then you can't get the citizenship or the green card.
[00:18:48.452 --> 00:18:50.414]  But then they admit with a provision.
[00:18:50.474 --> 00:18:51.895]  I have the bill here in front of me.
[00:18:52.315 --> 00:18:53.976]  I read this in horror this morning.
[00:18:54.676 --> 00:18:57.558]  They added it last night before the Senate passed it.
[00:18:57.618 --> 00:18:58.259]  And guess what it says?
[00:18:59.128 --> 00:19:03.750]  It says, oh, unless there's a hardship, unless you've already got family here, and then there's a waiver.
[00:19:04.150 --> 00:19:06.331]  And they're not going to enforce any of that to begin with.
[00:19:06.851 --> 00:19:16.515]  In the 86 amnesty, the government openly used La Raza and these other groups to actually run the citizenship offices.
[00:19:16.835 --> 00:19:22.757]  They broker it out and pay these anti-American groups, and they just rubber stamp everything.
[00:19:24.858 --> 00:19:26.298]  25 million illegal aliens.
[00:19:26.358 --> 00:19:28.179]  That is extremely conservative.
[00:19:29.511 --> 00:19:31.192]  The real numbers are over 30 million.
[00:19:31.232 --> 00:19:32.874]  The fake numbers you hear are 14 million.
[00:19:33.534 --> 00:19:39.559]  They are all going to be legalized, and the neocon liars, the Glenn Becks, the Sean Hannity's, the Limbaugh's.
[00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:45.724]  What, two days ago, Limbaugh had Cheney on, lying.
[00:19:46.945 --> 00:19:50.648]  And Cheney even admitted, oh, I'm here to convince conservatives.
[00:19:50.688 --> 00:19:51.649]  I'm here to lie to you.
[00:19:52.449 --> 00:19:53.911]  And a lot of you are going to buy into it.
[00:19:53.951 --> 00:19:56.192]  I've been having you confront me on the street.
[00:19:56.212 --> 00:19:57.954]  Hey, Bush finally got tough.
[00:19:58.613 --> 00:20:00.553]  Don't you ever get tired of being idiots?
[00:20:02.074 --> 00:20:12.796]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern, state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials, bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.
[00:20:12.976 --> 00:20:20.578]  The revolutionary Berkey Light, with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements, remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:20:20.798 --> 00:20:23.959]  Harmful or unwanted chemicals are reduced to below detectable levels.
[00:20:24.099 --> 00:20:24.499]  We're good to go.
[00:20:42.765 --> 00:20:48.730]  The rechargeable LED lighting system is beautiful as a nightlight and as necessary in emergency situations.
[00:20:48.950 --> 00:20:52.894]  Get the Berkey Light, the transparent water filter, for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:20:52.914 --> 00:20:53.494]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[00:21:02.259 --> 00:21:06.160]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt.
[00:21:06.381 --> 00:21:18.645]  But the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999, reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking 10.57% annual increase outpacing its previous 10 years.
[00:21:19.085 --> 00:21:19.485]  The U.S.
[00:21:19.525 --> 00:21:25.107]  economy receives its currency by taking on debt through a private banking institution called the Federal Reserve System.
[00:21:25.508 --> 00:21:27.708]  In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%.
[00:21:29.569 --> 00:21:30.049]  We're good to go.
[00:21:50.416 --> 00:21:54.437]  You must understand how recession and depression are driven by outstanding debt.
[00:21:54.537 --> 00:21:54.877]  Call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:55.017 --> 00:21:57.897]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:58.137 --> 00:22:04.798]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:22:05.279 --> 00:22:19.401]  Did you know that communism has stated that America would not jump from capitalism to communism, but our elected leaders would pass laws to socialize America, and one day we would wake up and have socialism-communism and not even know how it happened?
[00:22:20.214 --> 00:22:24.663]  Have we seen this very type of socialization of America over the last 60 years?
[00:22:25.644 --> 00:22:30.774]  We've been pushed far down the slippery slope of socialism, communism, and don't even know it.
[00:22:30.874 --> 00:22:32.598]  Just as Nikita Khrushchev said...
[00:22:33.268 --> 00:22:41.051]  We'd like to help you understand how these things are coming to pass by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[00:23:01.914 --> 00:23:04.236]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here with an important question.
[00:23:04.497 --> 00:23:06.539]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[00:23:06.679 --> 00:23:13.725]  I mean real hard to find all natural pure soap that contains no dyes, perfumes, deodorants, detergents, or other dangerous toxins.
[00:23:13.986 --> 00:23:22.534]  The Calbin Pure Soap Company, for the past 57 years, has been making triple concentrated pure soaps exclusively for healthcare professionals and hospitals.
[00:23:22.894 --> 00:23:27.578]  Now for the first time, Calbin Pure Soap is available factory direct to you and your family.
[00:23:27.718 --> 00:23:31.761]  That's great news because Calbin Pure Soap is made from all natural ingredients.

[00:23:49.893 --> 00:23:52.254]  Try Pure Soap once and I'll guarantee you'll never use anything else.
[00:24:12.373 --> 00:24:16.417]  I wasn't going to take any calls in his first 30 minutes because we've got a guest coming up in the next segment.
[00:24:16.437 --> 00:24:20.640]  I wanted to get into Bush's hoax.
[00:24:22.722 --> 00:24:26.906]  For six years, almost six years, he's been trying to pass this huge amnesty plan.
[00:24:27.426 --> 00:24:33.452]  And he gets up and has national televised press conferences and at State of the Unions he says it is not an amnesty.
[00:24:33.972 --> 00:24:38.256]  And then you go read the bill that, by the way, the Kennedys are supporting.
[00:24:38.869 --> 00:24:40.510]  So they're supporting Bush's bill.
[00:24:40.590 --> 00:24:41.831]  What do you think about that?
[00:24:42.131 --> 00:24:45.473]  Do you think Teddy Kennedy wants an amnesty?
[00:24:45.493 --> 00:24:47.755]  Do you think he'd support something that wasn't an amnesty?
[00:24:48.015 --> 00:24:49.376]  You can go read the bill.
[00:24:50.297 --> 00:24:51.237]  I want to get into this.
[00:24:52.838 --> 00:24:59.202]  And then they throw us a bone and claim troops on the border, which, again, they say is just for a few months.
[00:24:59.623 --> 00:25:03.065]  I want to get into this and Hayden and the rest of it, but Tim in New York...
[00:25:04.591 --> 00:25:14.957]  I'm told disagrees with us and told the folks that answer the phone, we don't screen calls, but you can volunteer if you'd like, that's why I know, that I've got the Fourth Amendment wrong.
[00:25:15.157 --> 00:25:18.579]  Okay, Tim, go ahead and tell me how I'm wrong.
[00:25:19.399 --> 00:25:30.605]  Well, if you read this, as you get through, it says, searches and seizures shall not be violated, and it says, and no warrant shall issue but upon probable cause.
[00:25:31.215 --> 00:25:35.243]  Well, what they're doing is saying probable cause doesn't go to the first part of it.
[00:25:35.303 --> 00:25:36.626]  It only goes to the warrants.
[00:25:38.607 --> 00:25:41.368]  That is not the case, sir, and that's what they do with the Second Amendment.
[00:25:41.408 --> 00:26:01.212]  They claim that it's divided up and that it's well-regulated militia and then try to claim there's no independent right to own guns when all the founding fathers, all the Federalist Papers, all of the precedent, all of the case law, all of the laws state that we have an inherent, organic, individual right to keep and bear arms, sir.
[00:26:01.752 --> 00:26:02.792]  So let me get this straight.
[00:26:02.832 --> 00:26:07.633]  You think the NSA has a right, without warrants, to just blanket spy on the American people?
[00:26:08.291 --> 00:26:09.152]  Absolutely not.
[00:26:10.292 --> 00:26:12.454]  But this is the way they're taking it.
[00:26:12.874 --> 00:26:16.116]  See, when they separate that, that's exactly what's going on.
[00:26:16.476 --> 00:26:20.659]  This is exactly what happened when Clinton said, what is the definition of is?
[00:26:20.759 --> 00:26:22.360]  So you don't really disagree with me then?
[00:26:22.420 --> 00:26:24.121]  No, no, I'm busting your chops.
[00:26:24.201 --> 00:26:25.842]  I wanted to play devil's advocate.
[00:26:26.242 --> 00:26:27.263]  But one quick thing.
[00:26:27.323 --> 00:26:29.444]  We showed martial law this past Tuesday.
[00:26:29.464 --> 00:26:30.425]  We had 125 people in Rochester, New York.
[00:26:33.298 --> 00:26:39.423]  Tremendous turnout, and I'd like to know when your next one's going to be released, because we want to show that as soon as possible.
[00:26:40.604 --> 00:26:43.326]  Well, it's going to be ready by late June.
[00:26:43.506 --> 00:26:51.311]  We are going to screen it for the first time in late June in Los Angeles at our huge 9-11 conference we're having with 24th and 25th in downtown L.A.,
[00:26:53.849 --> 00:26:56.450]  Well, we want to get that and show it in Rochester, New York as soon as possible.
[00:26:56.470 --> 00:26:57.010]  Well, thank you, sir.
[00:26:57.050 --> 00:26:58.151]  I appreciate the call.
[00:27:22.941 --> 00:27:29.911]  Yeah, I have the Fourth Amendment here in front of me, and we've already read it, and we've already played it several times today.
[00:27:30.352 --> 00:27:32.655]  So I'm not going to go over it again.
[00:27:32.675 --> 00:27:34.598]  I'm not going to do it.
[00:27:36.071 --> 00:27:42.257]  It is what it is, and Bill Clinton can say it depends on what the meaning of is, is, is, but we understand what it is.
[00:27:42.357 --> 00:27:44.479]  We know that this is illegal.
[00:27:44.739 --> 00:27:53.728]  We know we have the federal laws, the state laws, on top of the Bill of Rights, and Bush can claim that he's allowed to order torture.
[00:27:54.326 --> 00:27:57.787]  Bush can claim he's allowed to have no-bid contracts given to his friends.
[00:27:58.347 --> 00:28:04.589]  Bush can claim that he's allowed to order the Border Patrol in the past to not interdict illegal aliens.
[00:28:05.029 --> 00:28:07.410]  It's all criminal, and he's not allowed to do it.
[00:28:08.390 --> 00:28:10.310]  And I personally am sick and tired of it.
[00:28:10.731 --> 00:28:14.492]  I don't know about you, but so many people have been fooled.
[00:28:14.872 --> 00:28:18.653]  We're about to go to break and come back with a guest, but after the guest leaves us, the guest is just on for one segment.
[00:28:19.093 --> 00:28:23.054]  I'm going to get into detail of the new legislation that the Senate has passed
[00:28:23.621 --> 00:28:24.181]  We're good to go.
[00:28:24.201 --> 00:28:24.702]  We're good to go.
[00:28:48.977 --> 00:28:58.001]  And the Border Patrol and state agencies, state sheriffs have reported in Texas and Arizona and Southern California and Mexico record numbers.
[00:28:58.061 --> 00:29:03.743]  They've never, sheriffs who've been down there 25 years, have never seen this number of illegals.
[00:29:03.783 --> 00:29:05.203]  They are pouring in.
[00:29:05.644 --> 00:29:07.584]  They are waving their Mexican flags.
[00:29:07.644 --> 00:29:09.785]  They are saying this is Mexico.
[00:29:09.845 --> 00:29:11.626]  They're saying nothing will stop them.
[00:29:11.926 --> 00:29:16.908]  They're saying your fences won't stop us because they know they're backed up by our government and by their government.
[00:29:18.326 --> 00:29:21.650]  And so the Glenn Becks, and that's why I hate these people.
[00:29:21.770 --> 00:29:22.471]  I mean, I hate them.
[00:29:23.272 --> 00:29:29.239]  The Glenn Becks and the rest of them are on the radio lying, telling you Bush is getting tough.
[00:29:29.700 --> 00:29:32.543]  Bush is slitting America's throat.
[00:29:32.964 --> 00:29:36.128]  The blood of this country is spilling out in gouts.
[00:29:37.296 --> 00:29:46.666]  And a bunch of fake New World Order people are posing as conservatives, and they're going to fool a bunch of the idiots that want to love George Bush.
[00:29:46.906 --> 00:29:47.647]  So go ahead!
[00:29:47.847 --> 00:29:48.608]  Just be idiots!
[00:29:48.668 --> 00:29:49.249]  Go ahead!
[00:29:49.349 --> 00:29:50.050]  Don't listen to me!
[00:29:52.132 --> 00:29:53.033]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.533 --> 00:29:55.135]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:56.076 --> 00:29:58.739]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.704 --> 00:30:08.088]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[00:30:08.388 --> 00:30:13.070]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[00:30:13.391 --> 00:30:21.055]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms could be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:30:21.335 --> 00:30:28.179]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:30:28.419 --> 00:30:29.780]  There are no side effects.
[00:30:54.202 --> 00:30:57.083]  That's 866-885-6625.
[00:30:57.423 --> 00:31:01.184]  Once again, that's 866-885-6625.
[00:31:02.085 --> 00:31:05.666]  Do you know where the 78 potentially active volcanoes in the U.S.
[00:31:05.706 --> 00:31:06.186]  are located?
[00:31:06.406 --> 00:31:09.787]  And do you know the locations of the top 300 prime terrorist targets?
[00:31:10.008 --> 00:31:14.729]  You can find these answers and more in the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA.
[00:31:15.009 --> 00:31:19.991]  With the more than 50 interactive parameters, you can pinpoint natural and man-made disaster areas.
[00:31:20.151 --> 00:31:20.571]  We're good to go.
[00:31:20.591 --> 00:31:21.072]  We're good to go.
[00:31:41.244 --> 00:31:45.048]  Get Prudent Places USA for only $49 plus shipping by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[00:32:01.894 --> 00:32:08.757]  For months now, you've been hearing about the incredible health benefits of Zango, the functional health beverage made from the whole fruit of mangosteen.
[00:32:08.918 --> 00:32:21.844]  What you probably didn't know is that Zango joined forces with the leading manufacturer and distributor of functional health beverages like Capri Sun, Sobe, Mystic, and Red Bull to create the fastest growing business opportunity in America today.
[00:32:22.024 --> 00:32:23.805]  Are you sick of barely having enough money?
[00:32:23.985 --> 00:32:24.585]  We're good to go.
[00:32:43.197 --> 00:32:43.797]  We're good to go.
[00:32:43.857 --> 00:32:44.518]  We're good to go.
[00:33:21.104 --> 00:33:22.905]  I love physical activism.
[00:33:23.585 --> 00:33:24.446]  It's wonderful.
[00:33:25.186 --> 00:33:36.632]  All over the country, concerned Americans, liberals, conservatives, progressives, libertarians, whatever name you want to put on them, Green Party activists, have been going to governors and congressmen in women's homes.
[00:33:36.672 --> 00:33:38.172]  They've been going to Rumsfeld's house.
[00:33:38.833 --> 00:33:39.313]  Back when...
[00:33:40.242 --> 00:33:44.666]  Poindexter, the convicted felon, was running the Total Information Awareness Network.
[00:33:44.706 --> 00:33:48.990]  Remember when they were arrogant and thought they had us all convinced when they had 85% approval ratings?
[00:33:49.010 --> 00:33:54.655]  They were, yes, every credit card purchase, everything you buy, everything you do, is being put in a grand database.
[00:33:54.695 --> 00:33:55.997]  We're collecting all the data.
[00:33:56.317 --> 00:33:56.977]  Remember that?
[00:33:57.057 --> 00:33:58.219]  Remember it in the New York Times?
[00:33:58.479 --> 00:34:00.160]  That was all for your own good.
[00:34:00.381 --> 00:34:02.803]  The liberals were all for it, along with the neocons.
[00:34:04.136 --> 00:34:06.057]  Well, now they're trying to lie about all that.
[00:34:06.117 --> 00:34:10.318]  But even more importantly, Rumsfeld manufactured evidence.
[00:34:10.398 --> 00:34:12.879]  We have the White House memos, the Downing Street memos.
[00:34:13.179 --> 00:34:15.620]  They created a special office in the Pentagon to do it.
[00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:20.882]  We have their own minutes where they said, we're going to lie, we're going to manufacture evidence.
[00:34:21.422 --> 00:34:24.444]  Very serious crimes to take us to war.
[00:34:24.944 --> 00:34:33.367]  200,000 Iraqis conservatively dead now in the last three plus years, what, three years, two months, since the, quote, liberation and mission accomplished.
[00:34:34.261 --> 00:34:35.762]  And we have them red-handed.
[00:34:35.802 --> 00:34:37.562]  This needs to be the central issue.
[00:34:38.423 --> 00:34:43.684]  Now, David Swanson has, of course, worked in Dennis Kucinich's office.
[00:34:43.704 --> 00:34:44.705]  He's a great congressman.
[00:34:45.585 --> 00:34:47.986]  He is the creator of meetwithcindy.org.
[00:34:48.506 --> 00:34:54.388]  He, of course, helped found one of the co-founders of afterdowningstreet.org and so much more.
[00:34:54.488 --> 00:34:55.709]  Very, very effective.
[00:34:56.309 --> 00:34:56.689]  You bet.
[00:34:56.750 --> 00:35:01.974]  For those that don't know, and some Americans still don't know, Bush didn't lie to us on accident.
[00:35:01.994 --> 00:35:03.355]  He did it premeditatedly.
[00:35:03.395 --> 00:35:08.939]  So kind of go over why you guys are going to protest Rumsfeld and why you've been, I guess, pioneering this type of activism, sir.
[00:35:26.604 --> 00:35:37.628]  Well, Rumsfeld as well as Bush and Cheney and Condi and other members of the administration told numerous blatant lies in the lead-up to the war on Iraq.
[00:35:38.568 --> 00:35:40.949]  And as you said, this was not a mistake.
[00:35:40.969 --> 00:35:44.890]  They didn't think there really were weapons, and they were disappointed to find there weren't.
[00:35:45.290 --> 00:35:52.673]  They made a conscientious effort to defraud the American public and the Congress and the United Nations
[00:35:53.177 --> 00:35:58.521]  And pretend that there were weapons and that there were ties between Saddam Hussein and 9-11.
[00:35:58.701 --> 00:36:20.335]  And there is a link on our website, afterdowningstreet.org, to a database that a congress member has set up that lists the lies by the various administration officials by category, by who said them, and there are 50-some lies by Donald Rumsfeld in the lead-up to the war, including stating with absolute certainty that
[00:36:20.646 --> 00:36:28.328]  That there was a nuclear weapons program, that there were chemical weapons, that there were biological weapons, that there were ties to Al-Qaeda, and so forth.
[00:36:28.448 --> 00:36:34.410]  He knew these things to be false, but he claimed with absolute certainty to know where the weapons were.
[00:36:35.270 --> 00:36:42.732]  And so the media is not doing the best job, as you know, on calling him and others on this, so we're trying to do our part.
[00:36:44.614 --> 00:37:02.909]  I want to play about a three-minute clip of two weeks ago where Ray McGovern, high-level CIA analyst for 27 years, confronts Rumsfeld, and then Rumsfeld lies, like no one else I know in this administration, and that's quite an accomplishment, and says he never said that.
[00:37:03.229 --> 00:37:04.330]  Let's roll that clip.
[00:37:04.390 --> 00:37:04.831]  Here it is.
[00:37:05.271 --> 00:37:13.378]  At the Atlanta History Museum, not far from downtown, he's talking to the Southern Center for International Studies, and of course within the speech came a few protesters.
[00:37:18.437 --> 00:37:22.400]  And so I would like to ask you to be up front with the American people.
[00:37:22.921 --> 00:37:29.927]  Why did you lie to get us into a war that was not necessary and that has caused these kinds of casualties?
[00:37:30.027 --> 00:37:30.348]  Why?
[00:37:31.068 --> 00:37:33.110]  Well, first of all, I haven't lied.
[00:37:33.551 --> 00:37:34.652]  I did not lie then.
[00:37:44.071 --> 00:37:46.352]  Colin Powell didn't lie.
[00:37:48.272 --> 00:37:57.796]  He spent weeks and weeks with the Central Intelligence Agency people and prepared a presentation that I know he believed was accurate.
[00:37:58.816 --> 00:38:01.357]  And he presented that to the United Nations.
[00:38:02.377 --> 00:38:05.538]  The President spent weeks and weeks with the Central Intelligence people.
[00:38:06.158 --> 00:38:09.099]  And he went to the American people and made a presentation.
[00:38:09.279 --> 00:38:11.000]  I'm not in the intelligence business.
[00:38:12.325 --> 00:38:16.187]  They gave the world their honest opinion.
[00:38:17.207 --> 00:38:21.969]  It appears that there were not weapons of mass destruction there.
[00:38:22.389 --> 00:38:23.530]  You said you knew where they were.
[00:38:24.550 --> 00:38:25.070]  I did not.
[00:38:25.150 --> 00:38:27.291]  I said I knew where suspect sites were.
[00:38:27.551 --> 00:38:33.154]  You said you knew where they were, near Tikrit, near Baghdad, and northeast, south, and west of there.
[00:38:33.274 --> 00:38:34.294]  Those are your words.
[00:38:35.015 --> 00:38:37.035]  My words were that...
[00:38:39.970 --> 00:38:40.631]  No, no, no.
[00:38:40.671 --> 00:38:41.591]  Wait a minute, wait a minute.
[00:38:41.631 --> 00:38:42.752]  Let him stay one second.
[00:38:43.193 --> 00:38:43.753]  Just a second.
[00:38:43.773 --> 00:38:47.876]  This is America, huh?
[00:38:47.896 --> 00:38:48.657]  Alright, that's enough.
[00:38:50.158 --> 00:38:59.024]  So, and there's Ray McGovern saying this is America because security was starting to grab him and Rumsfeld knew it would look bad and so he told him to wait a minute.
[00:38:59.645 --> 00:39:05.409]  Then the mainstream media attacked McGovern instead of attacking Rumsfeld's new lie.
[00:39:05.609 --> 00:39:06.870]  David Swanson comments.
[00:39:07.560 --> 00:39:14.422]  Yeah, and Ray McGovern is not just an activist, and he was not screeching at Rumsfeld.
[00:39:14.462 --> 00:39:20.363]  He was speaking quite politely but directly in the way a good reporter should, but no reporter has yet to do.
[00:39:20.943 --> 00:39:24.184]  And Ray spent 27 years in the CIA.
[00:39:25.105 --> 00:39:26.445]  He's resigned.
[00:39:26.605 --> 00:39:28.505]  He's turned in his lifetime award.
[00:39:28.525 --> 00:39:34.547]  He doesn't want to be associated with an organization that tortures, and he's devoting every waking moment
[00:39:34.980 --> 00:39:37.662]  Yeah, well, we started out at the White House, at George W.'
[00:39:37.622 --> 00:39:41.646]  's house, although he had run down to the Mexican border for the day.
[00:39:57.450 --> 00:40:12.376]  We had a huge crowd there, and we had a petition signed by 43,000 people opposing attacking Iran because they are putting out identical lies and myths to generate a war against Iran now.
[00:40:12.876 --> 00:40:20.759]  And Cindy Sheehan and Ray McGovern and others led us in delivering all of those signatures and comments to the gate of the White House.
[00:40:21.259 --> 00:40:22.960]  And then we turned around and marched.
[00:40:23.424 --> 00:40:24.764]  Through Washington, D.C.
[00:40:24.804 --> 00:40:26.205]  We took over the streets.
[00:40:26.245 --> 00:40:27.685]  We didn't ask for a permit.
[00:40:27.765 --> 00:40:28.686]  We just did it.
[00:40:29.806 --> 00:40:33.788]  And the police officers were obliged to stop traffic and let us through.
[00:40:33.848 --> 00:40:36.929]  And we marched quite a ways through D.C.
[00:40:37.009 --> 00:40:38.749]  to Donald Rumsfeld's house.
[00:40:39.209 --> 00:40:43.071]  And he was not home, or at least said he was not home.
[00:40:43.131 --> 00:40:44.831]  And I think he probably was not.
[00:40:45.331 --> 00:40:47.472]  We had a crowd in front of his house.
[00:40:48.192 --> 00:40:48.293]  And...
[00:40:50.051 --> 00:40:59.595]  The police officers have really learned how these things work and how the media works, and they were very reluctant to arrest anybody.
[00:40:59.976 --> 00:41:18.304]  So we were all willing to be arrested, and Cindy Sheehan and Ray McGovern and the leaders of various organizations, especially Code Pink, were there to protest, to try to deliver a letter, to try to knock on his door, and the police were blocking us but would not arrest us.
[00:41:19.014 --> 00:41:23.158]  And we lay down on the sidewalk, we blocked the street, we did everything we could.
[00:41:24.139 --> 00:41:38.612]  Eventually, four people had to jump through the bushes and run for his front door through his little front yard and be tackled and handcuffed before they would arrest anyone, by which point much of the media had left.
[00:41:40.174 --> 00:41:43.877]  You have these very interesting arguments with the network producers there.
[00:41:45.328 --> 00:41:51.310]  Asking us when are people going to get arrested, and we telling them it's up to the police and so forth.
[00:41:51.710 --> 00:41:58.113]  They are willing, if it's colorful enough, to cover people being arrested, but they have no interest.
[00:41:58.233 --> 00:42:05.015]  The only message they want to send is protesters are criminal, they're nuts, they're fringe, they're out of control.
[00:42:05.055 --> 00:42:06.976]  That's the only time they cover demonstrations.
[00:42:07.656 --> 00:42:09.897]  That's right, and they do not want to air...
[00:42:10.478 --> 00:42:14.281]  I'm sure you've seen these disgusting hour-long puff pieces by Fox News where they go, The Warrior.
[00:42:34.210 --> 00:42:39.995]  The leader, the man of honor, the sexiest man on earth, Rumsfeld, the king.
[00:42:40.015 --> 00:42:44.399]  I mean, this is like Nazi propaganda or something.
[00:42:44.719 --> 00:42:46.280]  Right, and it's Nazi-like crimes.
[00:42:46.360 --> 00:42:55.988]  This is a guy who has sanctioned torture, who has sanctioned detentions without charge, who has sanctioned war crimes, the dumping of white phosphorus on civilians.
[00:42:56.088 --> 00:43:01.373]  These are Nazistic crimes, and the media is playing along, and
[00:43:01.829 --> 00:43:04.270]  And some portion of the American public is as well.
[00:43:04.310 --> 00:43:13.755]  The people in that room where Ray McGovern spoke and confronted Rumsfeld were on Rumsfeld's side and wanted Ray silenced.
[00:43:13.775 --> 00:43:15.075]  The majority of them, that is.
[00:43:15.756 --> 00:43:16.996]  You can hear one guy yell.
[00:43:17.517 --> 00:43:19.958]  You can hear one person say, We don't want to hear it!
[00:43:20.058 --> 00:43:24.220]  In fact, a lot of neocons, this is in my upcoming film, Terror Storm.
[00:43:25.143 --> 00:43:25.683]  Yeah, it's remarkable.
[00:43:25.703 --> 00:43:27.023]  Their heroes admit that nothing of the sort is true.
[00:43:27.444 --> 00:43:32.145]  The Bush administration admits that nothing was found, that there were no ties to 9-11, although...
[00:43:53.317 --> 00:44:07.885]  Rumsfeld tried in the conversation with Ray McGovern to still claim a tie between Saddam Hussein and Al-Qaeda, which Ray was quite abrupt in cutting him off on as blatantly false.
[00:44:08.066 --> 00:44:14.429]  But, yeah, this stuff is still out there, but it's every day fewer Americans buy it.
[00:44:14.709 --> 00:44:17.451]  And the vast majority of Americans now...
[00:44:20.079 --> 00:44:30.722]  You're right, and Bush's approval ratings have fallen now close to the mid-20s, 28% nationally, 22% in all other states like New York.
[00:44:31.742 --> 00:44:32.762]  What is Bush going to do?
[00:44:32.802 --> 00:44:34.143]  I mean, he is now in free fall.
[00:44:34.203 --> 00:44:37.624]  No president that I know of has ever had numbers this low.
[00:44:38.464 --> 00:44:42.485]  And, of course, we know it's because the people have caught him in so many lies, they don't believe anything now.
[00:44:43.209 --> 00:44:43.389]  Right.
[00:44:43.429 --> 00:44:55.638]  The Harris poll early this week had 71% disapproval, 29% approval, which Harris is a little different from some of the other polls that have been low 30s.
[00:44:56.118 --> 00:45:05.565]  But he's at or close to setting a record in every poll, topping Nixon, topping Truman for dislike among the public.
[00:45:06.065 --> 00:45:08.887]  And it's not just Democrats and Independents.
[00:45:09.148 --> 00:45:10.709]  It's many, many Republicans.
[00:45:10.969 --> 00:45:11.049]  And
[00:45:11.556 --> 00:45:19.022]  And so you have a president who's absolutely despised and whose vice president popularity is about half his own.
[00:45:19.202 --> 00:45:21.003]  It was 14% a few months ago.
[00:45:21.824 --> 00:45:22.845]  Have you seen the new numbers?
[00:45:22.905 --> 00:45:23.905]  I haven't seen them in a few months.
[00:45:24.026 --> 00:45:27.548]  I haven't seen any lower than that, but that's about as low as you can get.
[00:45:27.568 --> 00:45:29.790]  14% of Americans will believe anything.
[00:45:31.271 --> 00:45:34.934]  And yet you have a Democratic Party that's running in horror...
[00:45:35.543 --> 00:45:38.144]  From the strength of this president and vice president.
[00:45:38.184 --> 00:45:39.665]  Well, that's what I was going to bring up to you.
[00:45:39.825 --> 00:45:43.426]  You've worked for congressmen, democrats, you've been a democratic activist.
[00:45:44.166 --> 00:45:50.489]  I mean, who needs George Bush, the warmonger, when you've got Lieberman, you've got Hillary, you've got Schumer.
[00:45:51.069 --> 00:45:55.030]  I mean, are you going to go protest Hillary's New York home?
[00:45:55.091 --> 00:45:56.211]  I mean, you guys need to.
[00:45:57.133 --> 00:46:05.019]  Well, I'm promoting the campaign that my friend and fellow labor activist, Jonathan Ticini, is running to challenge her in the primary.
[00:46:05.059 --> 00:46:21.773]  I mean, here in Ticini, you have a Democrat who stands for workers' rights, peace, education, stopping the war, taking that hundreds of billions of dollars and putting it to some good use, taxing billionaires rather than working people.
[00:46:21.873 --> 00:46:25.636]  I mean, here's a Democrat with Democratic values challenging...
[00:46:26.292 --> 00:46:29.615]  A senator who, to all appearances, is a Republican.
[00:46:29.695 --> 00:46:36.342]  Well, I mean, we've known for four years that every week she has two- to five-hour meetings, depending on what paper you read.
[00:46:36.822 --> 00:46:44.990]  The Observer says four-hour secret dinner meetings with Roger Ailes, the head of Fox and the owner of Fox, Rupert Murdoch.
[00:46:45.070 --> 00:46:48.474]  Clinton, Bill Clinton, is off on vacation with the Bushes.
[00:46:49.034 --> 00:46:49.695]  I mean, come on.
[00:46:50.115 --> 00:46:54.398]  No, Hillary has called Bush a charming and charismatic hero and leader.
[00:46:55.019 --> 00:46:57.040]  Rupert Murdoch's throwing a fundraiser for her.
[00:46:58.621 --> 00:47:01.643]  She is not someone that represents people.
[00:47:01.703 --> 00:47:03.244]  She represents moneyed interests.
[00:47:04.185 --> 00:47:06.366]  And she is for war.
[00:47:06.546 --> 00:47:09.629]  She is for increasing the war, not ending it.
[00:47:09.729 --> 00:47:11.190]  Well, isn't that really the problem?
[00:47:11.270 --> 00:47:13.091]  Is the same global corporate interest...
[00:47:13.812 --> 00:47:14.492]  We're good to go.
[00:47:37.392 --> 00:47:44.776]  Which is one reason why I think the bright line we really have to draw in what we're going to support and what we're not is impeachment.
[00:47:45.236 --> 00:47:50.298]  Because Congress could end the war, and the war would as likely as not not end.
[00:47:50.699 --> 00:47:56.341]  This is an administration that openly ignores acts of Congress.
[00:47:57.062 --> 00:48:05.026]  And so if we can impeach and remove from office this president and vice president and the secretary of war...
[00:48:06.439 --> 00:48:11.421]  We have a chance at restoring not just peace in the world, but democracy in this country.
[00:48:12.122 --> 00:48:19.344]  And it's not to say that the Democrats are great, and that's part of impeaching a Republican leader.
[00:48:19.384 --> 00:48:27.048]  No, we have to take out the people at the top, but it's not to excuse any Republicans or Democrats who've been supporting them.
[00:48:27.168 --> 00:48:30.429]  And in fact, in pushing impeachment, we get accused of
[00:48:31.030 --> 00:48:32.210]  Revenge for Clinton.
[00:48:32.330 --> 00:48:35.891]  Well, I wanted Clinton impeached, not for sex, but for some good reasons.
[00:48:36.131 --> 00:48:44.294]  And those on the left who are pushing impeachment of Bush and Cheney openly and courageously were not fans of Clinton.
[00:48:44.314 --> 00:48:48.755]  The ones who were fans of Clinton, including his wife, are strongly against him.
[00:48:48.775 --> 00:48:50.355]  Well, you're right.
[00:48:50.515 --> 00:48:53.296]  The criminal corporate interests that are not remarked
[00:48:54.062 --> 00:49:02.627]  But, you know, going back here, Congressman Ron Paul, with the most conservative voting record in Congress, can't call him a liberal, he says...
[00:49:03.929 --> 00:49:05.250]  Bush needs to be impeached.
[00:49:05.751 --> 00:49:08.634]  He says we are in danger of Bush becoming a dictator.
[00:49:09.134 --> 00:49:15.681]  He has said on this show that he believes the executive is trying to set up a dictatorial police state.
[00:49:16.001 --> 00:49:17.562]  Folks, this ain't a joke, okay?
[00:49:17.582 --> 00:49:18.283]  Do you understand?
[00:49:18.323 --> 00:49:20.846]  We're in physical danger.
[00:49:20.966 --> 00:49:22.567]  They're building camps.
[00:49:22.767 --> 00:49:24.469]  It's in the Houston Chronicle.
[00:49:24.509 --> 00:49:25.150]  David Swanson?
[00:49:25.871 --> 00:49:26.231]  You're right.
[00:49:26.271 --> 00:49:32.133]  Ron Paul is a Republican Congress member, and he's turned around on the question of the war.
[00:49:32.233 --> 00:49:34.554]  He's willing to challenge the president somewhat.
[00:49:34.954 --> 00:49:43.456]  He has not signed on to Congressman John Conyers' bill, House Resolution 635, which does not call for impeachment.
[00:49:43.776 --> 00:49:45.497]  It calls for an impeachment investigation.
[00:49:45.517 --> 00:49:48.978]  It calls for an investigation into whether there are grounds for impeachment.
[00:49:49.018 --> 00:49:52.519]  So this is a step back even from impeachment, which is only an indictment.
[00:49:54.828 --> 00:50:00.753]  We also have other Democrats who are running around saying, let's hold off on impeachment.
[00:50:00.773 --> 00:50:02.754]  If the Democrats all lined up on impeachment...
[00:50:15.990 --> 00:50:23.520]  The pressure would be on Republicans in moderate districts to come around and put the Constitution ahead of the guy occupying the White House.
[00:50:23.540 --> 00:50:25.442]  Look, the left hand washes the right hand.
[00:50:25.462 --> 00:50:26.844]  The right hand washes the left hand.
[00:50:26.864 --> 00:50:28.065]  They all play golf together.
[00:50:28.085 --> 00:50:28.907]  They all hang out.
[00:50:29.247 --> 00:50:30.709]  It's the elite against the people.
[00:50:30.769 --> 00:50:31.490]  You know that, David.
[00:50:32.418 --> 00:50:35.419]  I agree, but the people can't go and crawl under their beds.
[00:50:35.459 --> 00:50:36.880]  We've got to fight to change things.
[00:50:37.240 --> 00:50:39.941]  Stay there for one more little five-minute segment after this three-minute break.
[00:50:39.981 --> 00:50:44.703]  I want to find out strategies, because you have been effective, to impeach Bush.
[00:50:45.003 --> 00:50:46.044]  But I want more than that.
[00:50:46.704 --> 00:50:52.546]  After they're impeached, I want criminal charges on Rumsfeld, Cheney, Bush, all of them.
[00:50:52.586 --> 00:50:55.748]  These criminals need to go behind bars.
[00:50:56.828 --> 00:50:58.069]  They are terrorists.
[00:51:02.975 --> 00:51:05.817]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[00:51:06.077 --> 00:51:06.778]  Hello, my friends.
[00:51:06.878 --> 00:51:07.658]  Alex Jones here.
[00:51:07.998 --> 00:51:12.661]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law, 9-11, Rise of the Police State.
[00:51:13.022 --> 00:51:19.746]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[00:51:20.086 --> 00:51:22.047]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[00:51:22.267 --> 00:51:25.108]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[00:51:25.188 --> 00:51:29.870]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[00:51:30.070 --> 00:51:34.471]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[00:51:34.712 --> 00:51:41.934]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[00:51:42.174 --> 00:51:44.595]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.

[00:53:48.392 --> 00:53:48.672]  Thank you.
[00:54:09.364 --> 00:54:16.132]  We live in a predator state with a out-of-control elite that is literally feeding on human populations.
[00:54:16.152 --> 00:54:20.257]  They confuse us with Democrat, Republican, Tory, Labor.
[00:54:20.657 --> 00:54:22.059]  None of this means anything.
[00:54:23.020 --> 00:54:26.344]  And we better get our heads screwed on straight and begin to understand this.
[00:54:27.190 --> 00:54:29.651]  Listen, this government is saying it's above the law.
[00:54:30.591 --> 00:54:37.313]  Their top advisors in the White House openly write memos saying they can torture small children in front of their parents.
[00:54:37.353 --> 00:54:38.854]  I don't want anyone to forget that.
[00:54:39.194 --> 00:54:41.075]  These people are wolves.
[00:54:41.635 --> 00:54:43.836]  I mean, I am afraid of not fighting them.
[00:54:44.116 --> 00:54:46.256]  I'm not afraid of them personally.
[00:54:46.336 --> 00:54:50.958]  I'm afraid of not doing enough to fight them and their aims taking place.
[00:54:50.978 --> 00:54:53.839]  They're openly calling for dictatorship.
[00:54:53.879 --> 00:54:56.580]  That's what Bush is claiming he has the power of.
[00:54:57.240 --> 00:54:59.142]  David Swanson of davidswanson.org.
[00:54:59.162 --> 00:55:01.004]  We have links to you up on infowars.com.
[00:55:01.284 --> 00:55:04.427]  Just in closing, how do we put the brakes to these people?
[00:55:04.707 --> 00:55:07.149]  I mean, clearly, they're going for broke.
[00:55:07.169 --> 00:55:09.952]  They're going for total domination of this country and the world.
[00:55:10.272 --> 00:55:11.393]  This is life and death.
[00:55:11.453 --> 00:55:12.454]  We've got to stop them.
[00:55:12.972 --> 00:55:23.195]  Well, the non-violent way that we can stop them and restore the rule of law and restore checks and balances and democracy is to impeach them, convict them, and remove them from office.
[00:55:23.255 --> 00:55:27.756]  And that doesn't interfere with later or simultaneous criminal prosecution.
[00:55:28.336 --> 00:55:37.199]  If people come to afterdowningstreet.org, and there's a link to it, I'm sure, at infowars.com, you can do a couple of things.
[00:55:37.239 --> 00:55:41.700]  You can help push your Congress member to get on John Conyers' bill for an investigation.
[00:55:42.205 --> 00:55:48.148]  And you can help push your town or city or state to pass a resolution for impeachment.
[00:55:48.228 --> 00:55:52.030]  And we have Vermont and other states very close to that, don't we?
[00:55:52.070 --> 00:55:57.093]  Vermont, California, and Illinois legislatures have seen these resolutions introduced.
[00:55:57.313 --> 00:56:00.755]  California has made it past an initial committee stage.
[00:56:01.495 --> 00:56:06.098]  It remains to be seen which states, if any, will pass the resolutions.
[00:56:06.178 --> 00:56:08.719]  And so that's the project we're working on.
[00:56:08.879 --> 00:56:09.720]  David Swanson...
[00:56:11.116 --> 00:56:12.757]  I look at the crimes of Nixon.
[00:56:13.697 --> 00:56:22.600]  He is a saint compared to the open crimes Bush and his henchmen, his horsemen, his ringwraiths have committed.
[00:56:22.640 --> 00:56:25.281]  I mean, we've got to have criminal charges.
[00:56:25.981 --> 00:56:26.561]  Absolutely.
[00:56:26.601 --> 00:56:29.422]  This is nothing compared to Nixon, much less Clinton.
[00:56:29.622 --> 00:56:38.945]  This is openly violating hundreds of laws, openly violating the highest laws of this land and international law.
[00:56:38.965 --> 00:56:39.085]  750 plus.
[00:56:41.424 --> 00:56:51.710]  750 plus laws, the president has written a signing statement, so he signs the bill into law, has never vetoed a single bill, but writes a statement saying, I disagree with this law, here's what it really means.
[00:56:51.771 --> 00:56:54.552]  And that's not law, that's what a dictator does.
[00:56:54.992 --> 00:57:03.998]  Absolutely, or a unitary executive, as they've renamed dictatorship, but that's what they are claiming the power to do, and for the most part, Congress is rolling over.
[00:57:04.318 --> 00:57:07.139]  Sir, I commend you and your work at redonningstreet.org.
[00:57:07.179 --> 00:57:09.000]  We appreciate you joining us.
[00:57:09.080 --> 00:57:09.521]  Take care.
[00:57:09.781 --> 00:57:10.201]  You too.
[00:57:10.281 --> 00:57:10.601]  Thank you.
[00:57:10.841 --> 00:57:11.201]  You bet.
[00:57:11.842 --> 00:57:13.542]  This isn't a joke, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:57:13.923 --> 00:57:16.124]  This country is going down right now.
[00:57:16.664 --> 00:57:17.704]  The dollar is plunging.
[00:57:17.744 --> 00:57:18.725]  It's all by design.
[00:57:19.406 --> 00:57:21.288]  We've got a big guest coming up in the next hour.
[00:57:21.308 --> 00:57:22.148]  We'll take calls.
[00:57:23.009 --> 00:57:24.631]  The article is The Predator State.
[00:57:25.151 --> 00:57:28.674]  And he's an author about how the best way to rob a bank is to own one.
[00:57:29.155 --> 00:57:30.336]  This is very, very important.
[00:57:30.356 --> 00:57:31.056]  You'll want to stay with us.
[00:57:31.096 --> 00:57:34.720]  Before we end this hour, if you believe in this broadcast, you need to get my films.
[00:57:34.860 --> 00:57:36.781]  Because it does support the broadcast, make it possible.
[00:57:37.022 --> 00:57:37.842]  But that's secondary.
[00:57:37.862 --> 00:57:39.123]  These are powerful videos.
[00:57:39.163 --> 00:57:43.427]  Videos I've produced, videos I've made, and other documentaries I think are the best out there.
[00:57:43.487 --> 00:57:45.329]  Other books, other books on tape.
[00:57:46.187 --> 00:57:46.507]  We're good to go.
[00:58:05.194 --> 00:58:05.814]  We're good to go.
[00:58:31.428 --> 00:58:36.769]  What, 30-something days out from this thing, and the tickets are going fast, so get them.
[00:58:37.069 --> 00:58:37.989]  We'll be right back.
[00:58:41.510 --> 00:58:46.371]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-300-7645.
[00:58:46.391 --> 00:58:46.671]  Big Brother
[00:58:59.287 --> 00:59:00.367]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:01.047 --> 00:59:02.208]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.808 --> 00:59:03.648]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.388 --> 00:59:05.268]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.288 --> 00:59:09.789]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.129 --> 00:59:14.270]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:15.690 --> 00:59:20.211]  The best way to rob a bank is to own one.
[00:59:20.231 --> 00:59:25.852]  How corporate executives and politicians looted our country.
[00:59:26.534 --> 00:59:28.055]  We have this author coming up.
[00:59:28.315 --> 00:59:34.118]  Bill Black is an associate professor of economics and law at UMKC.
[00:59:34.319 --> 00:59:36.920]  He is the executive director of the Institute for Fraud Prevention.
[00:59:37.320 --> 00:59:43.204]  He has taught previously at the LBJ School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas at Austin and Santa Clara University.
[00:59:43.564 --> 00:59:44.745]  And his bio goes on and on.
[00:59:44.785 --> 00:59:51.208]  We first learned of him in an article out of Mother Jones, The Predator State, Enron, Tyco, WorldCom, and the U.S.
[00:59:51.709 --> 00:59:52.189]  Government.
[00:59:53.072 --> 00:59:55.953]  And he'll be joining us coming up after this first break.
[00:59:56.894 --> 01:00:00.615]  Later in the show, we're going to open the phones up, of course, and I'm just hopping mad.
[01:00:01.916 --> 01:00:15.141]  It's hard to track the legislation they passed through the Senate before they pass it, because the blanket amnesty border reform plan is having writers and being rewritten by the minute.
[01:00:15.181 --> 01:00:19.203]  But I did get, this morning, what the Senate passed last night.
[01:00:19.907 --> 01:00:25.371]  And I did spend about 45 minutes scanning over the legislation, and then sure enough went to my cheat sheet.
[01:00:25.391 --> 01:00:30.594]  There were a few mainstream news articles that admitted what indeed was in the bill, and I did find those subsections.
[01:00:31.235 --> 01:00:37.419]  It is total, absolute, complete, blanket amnesty.
[01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:42.943]  It won't matter if they put troops on the border, because these people will no longer be illegal.
[01:00:43.979 --> 01:00:53.383]  Corporations can sign up hundreds of thousands of people a month if they want and drive them across on buses because they, quote, have jobs waiting for them, unskilled and skilled.
[01:00:54.263 --> 01:01:03.127]  There's a proviso in there that actually has a trap door in it, and that's in the legislation, that, okay, if you're a felon, then you can't seek to get amnesty.
[01:01:03.487 --> 01:01:12.531]  But it says if there's a hardship, if you've got any family in this country or a sick family, wherever, in Mexico, and you needed the money, it's okay, we'll waive it.
[01:01:13.425 --> 01:01:23.034]  So there's nothing, and even Bush's troops on the border, he admits, will be two months while they, quote, get more funding for the Border Patrol to put 2,000 more Border Patrol agents in.
[01:01:23.334 --> 01:01:35.626]  We lost 2,000 Border Patrol agents in Texas alone after 9-11 because they got starting pay increases of up from, what, $38,000 a year for a new Border Patrol agent to over $57,000 a year.
[01:01:38.408 --> 01:01:40.469]  I forget the exact numbers.
[01:01:40.769 --> 01:01:41.770]  $24,000 increase to start.
[01:01:41.970 --> 01:01:50.915]  So they all left to become air marshals and sit around on airplanes instead of just arming the pilots, if you believe the stupid official 9-11 story, the fable.
[01:01:52.416 --> 01:01:56.518]  It is so frustrating to know it is all a stinking lie!
[01:01:58.119 --> 01:02:04.382]  And at the TV station on Wednesday night and on the street last night, I was walking into a restaurant to meet my wife and kids for dinner.
[01:02:05.009 --> 01:02:07.871]  And people walk up to me and go, Alex Bush is getting better.
[01:02:07.951 --> 01:02:09.271]  You shouldn't be against him.
[01:02:09.711 --> 01:02:14.034]  Some guy in a pickup truck on the side of the street then the day before that.
[01:02:14.054 --> 01:02:16.635]  I've had, what, three people going, Bush is getting tough.
[01:02:16.835 --> 01:02:20.917]  And I'm getting your emails and I'm telling you what, I can't hardly help but throw up on them.
[01:02:22.698 --> 01:02:24.479]  I mean, how stupid do you want to be?
[01:02:24.539 --> 01:02:25.900]  How con do you want to be?
[01:02:26.960 --> 01:02:33.964]  Bush, they must have like contests to lie the worst or be the most ridiculous or throw stuff in our face.
[01:02:36.639 --> 01:02:38.600]  It never ends.
[01:02:40.100 --> 01:02:45.242]  The level of bamboozlement and befuddlement that we will go through.
[01:02:45.262 --> 01:02:48.242]  It's all lies.
[01:02:48.903 --> 01:02:56.085]  Bush openly coordinates with Mexico to tell their troops where the Minutemen are to reroute.
[01:02:56.145 --> 01:02:59.046]  The Mexican troops shepherd the coyotes, the smugglers.
[01:02:59.906 --> 01:03:03.307]  A fraction of the smugglers that are caught are not prosecuted.
[01:03:04.187 --> 01:03:05.787]  That is a fraction of them are.
[01:03:05.827 --> 01:03:06.927]  The vast majority aren't.
[01:03:06.947 --> 01:03:08.228]  That's right out of the Associated Press.
[01:03:08.628 --> 01:03:09.908]  I'm going to go over all this today.
[01:03:11.368 --> 01:03:16.969]  They don't enforce the laws on the illegal aliens because they are a protected group by the globalists.
[01:03:16.989 --> 01:03:19.230]  The CFR's own document last year shows it.
[01:03:19.250 --> 01:03:20.910]  Lou Dobbs has even reported it.
[01:03:21.230 --> 01:03:22.890]  This is the American Union.
[01:03:23.130 --> 01:03:26.991]  This is the end of the United States and our republic.
[01:03:27.091 --> 01:03:30.191]  Do you understand?
[01:03:30.291 --> 01:03:33.492]  If Bush implements this amnesty plan...
[01:03:35.109 --> 01:03:38.854]  America, for all intents and purposes, is gone.
[01:03:40.396 --> 01:03:43.240]  And they're already reporting record numbers of illegals pouring across.
[01:03:43.280 --> 01:03:44.722]  They're only going to beef that up now.
[01:03:47.826 --> 01:03:51.231]  And the average conservative is just in la-la land worshipping Bush.
[01:03:54.600 --> 01:04:01.983]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[01:04:02.243 --> 01:04:06.985]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[01:04:07.205 --> 01:04:12.848]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[01:04:13.148 --> 01:04:17.631]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[01:04:17.851 --> 01:04:25.016]  The cashless society control grid, infallible microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[01:04:25.036 --> 01:04:29.559]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[01:04:29.719 --> 01:04:32.221]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[01:04:32.461 --> 01:04:39.186]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.
[01:04:39.406 --> 01:04:44.673]  Order online now at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling 1-888-253-3139.
[01:04:44.693 --> 01:04:45.113]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:04:53.695 --> 01:04:55.236]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:04:55.637 --> 01:05:01.381]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[01:05:01.641 --> 01:05:06.765]  The Berkey Light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[01:05:07.106 --> 01:05:16.393]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, trihalomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.
[01:05:16.733 --> 01:05:21.694]  Its rechargeable 8-lamp bright white LED lighting system provides the ideal source of emergency light.
[01:05:22.014 --> 01:05:26.015]  The lights can run all night on a single charge, and it is bright enough to read by.
[01:05:26.215 --> 01:05:30.976]  This provides a relaxing and ambient night light that allows for optimum use during emergency conditions.
[01:05:31.357 --> 01:05:37.278]  The Berkey Light's revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.
[01:05:37.598 --> 01:05:38.179]  We're good to go.
[01:06:07.196 --> 01:06:07.736]  We're good to go.
[01:06:32.503 --> 01:06:33.883]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:06:33.983 --> 01:06:35.084]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:07.116 --> 01:07:09.579]  Oh, you gotta love these absent-minded professors.
[01:07:09.619 --> 01:07:19.032]  Professor Black will be joining us in the next hour to talk about the best way to rob a bank is to own one, getting into how these corporate crime syndicates work with the government to loot.
[01:07:19.753 --> 01:07:22.454]  The economy and then have the American people fit the bill for it.
[01:07:22.494 --> 01:07:23.414]  That's coming up the next hour.
[01:07:23.794 --> 01:07:25.835]  That's kind of good because I wanted to get into the border.
[01:07:25.855 --> 01:07:27.255]  I wanted to get into the smoke and mirrors.
[01:07:27.695 --> 01:07:30.176]  Really to tail it for you and to take your calls.
[01:07:30.536 --> 01:07:32.457]  But right now let's start going to your calls.
[01:07:32.497 --> 01:07:34.597]  The toll free number to join us on air is 1-800-259-9231.
[01:07:34.617 --> 01:07:34.757]  800-259-9231.
[01:07:34.777 --> 01:07:35.738]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:07:35.798 --> 01:07:37.238]  This is Genesis Communications.
[01:07:43.940 --> 01:07:55.872]  And the websites are jonesreport.com, infowars.net, prisonplanet.tv, prisonplanet.com, infowars.com, marshalllaw911.info, and several others we're in the process of launching.
[01:07:56.565 --> 01:08:04.692]  And they all have basically the same information on them, but each site every day has something a little different, two or three different little articles or videos or key information for you.
[01:08:05.092 --> 01:08:09.536]  And this way we have more flagships out there in the fight against the globalists.
[01:08:09.616 --> 01:08:22.246]  And to show you how effective our message has gotten, one of my websites, prisonplanet.com, is very close to getting as much traffic every day as rushlimbaugh.com.
[01:08:23.010 --> 01:08:30.537]  You can go to Alexa.com and other places, web ratings, traffic ports, and they will tell you exactly how many visitors you get.
[01:08:31.117 --> 01:08:39.204]  One of my sites, on a routine basis, is bigger, but in an average year, it's about 5,000, Limbaugh's about 4,000.
[01:08:40.245 --> 01:08:46.731]  We are very close to overtaking him, the biggest radio talk show host site in the country.
[01:08:47.131 --> 01:08:52.134]  To give you an idea, the Dallas Morning News is rated at about 4,500, so Limbaugh's bigger than them.
[01:08:52.714 --> 01:08:56.196]  One of my sites will soon eclipse Rush Limbaugh.
[01:08:56.476 --> 01:08:57.717]  How do you like that?
[01:08:57.777 --> 01:09:08.423]  You guys can sit there and spout your propaganda and spout your phony conservatism and try to sell conservatives out and try to neutralize conservatives and pacify us.
[01:09:08.823 --> 01:09:09.964]  It isn't going to work.
[01:09:10.564 --> 01:09:12.565]  So you guys all just keep it up.
[01:09:13.283 --> 01:09:17.166]  We can launch a website in six months, have it bigger than most major newspapers.
[01:09:17.826 --> 01:09:19.768]  That's why we're just launching more and more of them.
[01:09:20.228 --> 01:09:21.669]  We'll see how you like it.
[01:09:22.250 --> 01:09:23.811]  And I appreciate you, the listeners.
[01:09:23.871 --> 01:09:26.973]  I appreciate you spreading the word about our websites.
[01:09:28.394 --> 01:09:29.815]  Let's go to Joe in Wisconsin.
[01:09:29.855 --> 01:09:30.676]  Joe, you're on the air.
[01:09:30.696 --> 01:09:31.696]  Hi, Alex.
[01:09:32.847 --> 01:09:34.128]  First of all, thanks very much.
[01:09:34.148 --> 01:09:37.070]  I've got two bits of good news and an observation for you.
[01:09:37.671 --> 01:09:41.054]  In Wisconsin, they have a bill against forced chipping by employers.
[01:09:41.474 --> 01:09:44.476]  The bad part, the downside, would be it's voluntary.
[01:09:44.737 --> 01:09:46.258]  I don't know exactly what that means.
[01:09:46.318 --> 01:09:47.439]  I've got to dig into the bill.
[01:09:48.152 --> 01:09:51.654]  Now, I've seen the legislation, and it shows how bad things have gotten.
[01:09:52.395 --> 01:09:58.398]  This all started because a Wisconsin-based security company is trying to make its employees take tracker chips.
[01:09:58.819 --> 01:10:03.922]  Major governments like Mexico are trying to make the Attorney General's staff take them.
[01:10:04.382 --> 01:10:11.647]  Two Latin American presidents are trying to say that part of Bush's guest worker program they're offering to chip their people.
[01:10:11.947 --> 01:10:13.708]  I mean, this is really happening, folks.
[01:10:14.128 --> 01:10:14.889]  Yep.
[01:10:14.909 --> 01:10:33.120]  The second thing is I wanted to personally pick up the challenge of getting off my behind and doing something, and what I want to do is provide $500 of free web service, kind of like make a blog, preferably for veterans or homeschoolers or just truth-moving.
[01:10:33.140 --> 01:10:39.805]  And just whatever means to winnow that out, but whoever...
[01:10:42.029 --> 01:11:00.081]  Well, I would just tell you, sir, and I appreciate the call, when you're starting websites, to just start them, start your own site, start your own news site, and then find like-minded people out there and offer them space on your site for organizations and groups.
[01:11:00.761 --> 01:11:02.423]  I was hoping you could fill me in on the details of that...
[01:11:21.724 --> 01:11:25.067]  The Japanese paper that went public with this stuff I heard about?
[01:11:25.247 --> 01:11:31.012]  Yeah, that was the Tokyo Journal, one of the biggest English publications nationwide in Japan.
[01:11:32.593 --> 01:11:33.514]  And what was it?
[01:11:33.994 --> 01:11:36.536]  Was it basically everything that you say was in the paper?
[01:11:36.717 --> 01:11:39.379]  Yes, they quoted my research and others' research.
[01:11:40.151 --> 01:11:40.611]  Okay, thanks, Alex.
[01:11:40.631 --> 01:11:41.092]  Thank you, Jason.
[01:11:41.112 --> 01:11:44.333]  Bill, in Baltimore, where if you ask the police for directions politely, they arrest you.
[01:11:44.413 --> 01:11:44.854]  Go ahead, Bill.
[01:11:44.874 --> 01:11:45.074]  Well, this...
[01:12:07.833 --> 01:12:08.534]  This is different.
[01:12:08.874 --> 01:12:10.896]  Last night we had a homicide in the neighborhood.
[01:12:10.996 --> 01:12:12.417]  Well, I was just mentioning where you're from.
[01:12:12.637 --> 01:12:13.218]  Go ahead, sorry.
[01:12:13.498 --> 01:12:20.024]  Yeah, I sent you that article the other day about somebody was, you know, stopped and said, you know, can we get directions on how to get to I-95?
[01:12:20.044 --> 01:12:23.427]  And you were like, no, we'll just arrest you and haul you off to jail.
[01:12:25.108 --> 01:12:27.831]  But last night we had a homicide in the neighborhood.
[01:12:27.851 --> 01:12:29.112]  I live next to the police station.
[01:12:29.152 --> 01:12:31.594]  I sent you some pictures for your website if you want to use them.
[01:12:31.814 --> 01:12:33.035]  What address did you send them to?
[01:12:34.659 --> 01:12:36.239]  Tips at Infowars.com.
[01:12:36.459 --> 01:12:36.799]  Good.
[01:12:37.199 --> 01:12:37.800]  We'll find it.
[01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:40.520]  But it's really strange.
[01:12:40.560 --> 01:12:43.421]  They were one block from the police station and had an accident.
[01:12:43.541 --> 01:12:44.441]  Now, I don't know what happened.
[01:12:44.461 --> 01:12:45.561]  This is what the story is.
[01:12:46.281 --> 01:12:49.142]  And one of the policemen died and the other one went to shock trauma.
[01:12:49.862 --> 01:12:52.122]  And in the process, they had a telephone pole.
[01:12:52.162 --> 01:12:57.183]  In the picture I showed you, the telephone pole was split about 15 feet off the ground with no damage on the bottom at all.
[01:12:58.463 --> 01:13:01.344]  And, of course, they came out, cleaned everything up, new pole, everything.
[01:13:03.237 --> 01:13:04.517]  That's very suspicious.
[01:13:05.737 --> 01:13:09.618]  Yeah, it almost seemed like a big operation to do something like that, wasn't it?
[01:13:09.638 --> 01:13:11.459]  So they didn't crash into the pole?
[01:13:13.159 --> 01:13:14.899]  Well, I don't know.
[01:13:15.439 --> 01:13:18.000]  If they had an accident there, then they would have crashed into the pole.
[01:13:18.100 --> 01:13:19.000]  And there was a car hit.
[01:13:19.060 --> 01:13:20.280]  I sent you a picture of the car.
[01:13:21.480 --> 01:13:27.682]  But it's just weird that the damage on the pole was like 15 feet off the ground, and then they came out and put a new pole in.
[01:13:28.122 --> 01:13:30.002]  And within five or six hours, they had a new pole in.
[01:13:30.022 --> 01:13:30.122]  But
[01:13:30.923 --> 01:13:47.227]  Sometimes what happens if a pole gets hit down low and the car bounces off, it causes a split where it hit, but the split then 15 feet up because of the weight of the pole above it, that's where it has enough force to break off, that's where the juncture of the weight causes the split to take place.
[01:13:48.048 --> 01:13:57.050]  We've got photos I sent you, there was no split where it was hit, and also I woke up at 6 o'clock, 5 o'clock, no power, and once again police helicopters over the house and everybody thinks that this
[01:13:57.520 --> 01:13:58.582]  Police state thing is a joke.
[01:13:58.602 --> 01:13:59.905]  That's all normal in Baltimore.
[01:13:59.945 --> 01:14:03.552]  It's normal to have police helicopters fly over your house 15 times a day.
[01:14:04.728 --> 01:14:06.929]  Oh, here in Austin, every week you get your visit.
[01:14:06.969 --> 01:14:09.531]  They hover over your house, but I'm not alone.
[01:14:09.571 --> 01:14:13.313]  They move on to the neighbor in the next house, and they've got scanners scanning your home.
[01:14:13.353 --> 01:14:28.423]  And the Army nationwide is giving big police departments not just infrared that looks through your walls with a fuzzy image, but high-quality ground-penetrating radar where they get black-and-white images of you in the bathroom, in bed with your wife, at the table eating Cheerios.
[01:14:28.503 --> 01:14:29.003]  It's freedom.
[01:14:29.043 --> 01:14:29.804]  Thanks for the call.
[01:14:30.324 --> 01:14:31.625]  Let's talk to Bernie.
[01:14:32.565 --> 01:14:34.266]  And he's calling us from Virginia.
[01:14:34.326 --> 01:14:34.727]  Welcome.
[01:14:35.107 --> 01:14:36.668]  Hi, Alex, how are you doing?
[01:14:36.988 --> 01:14:37.168]  Good.
[01:14:37.188 --> 01:14:40.070]  Your phone sounds like an electric razor, so I'm going to give you about 30 seconds.
[01:14:40.290 --> 01:14:44.012]  Okay, well, it's got something to do with Homeland Security, probably.
[01:14:44.212 --> 01:14:47.294]  Okay, do you want to hear about my dream about the future?
[01:14:48.875 --> 01:14:49.696]  Go ahead, sir.
[01:14:49.716 --> 01:14:52.017]  Okay, I had a dream about the future.
[01:14:52.077 --> 01:15:01.143]  In the dream, things got so bad that communities were surrounded with giant-sized box fences to protect themselves from
[01:15:02.768 --> 01:15:09.211]  I've got to let you go.
[01:15:09.231 --> 01:15:10.892]  I just can't do this to the listeners, sir.
[01:15:10.912 --> 01:15:12.473]  I'm sorry, but it's so loud.
[01:15:12.913 --> 01:15:14.594]  We can't even really hear you.
[01:15:17.635 --> 01:15:20.237]  I don't know how people have phones that sound like electric razors.
[01:15:21.397 --> 01:15:25.139]  But before I go to Tom and others that are holding, let me just comment on this.
[01:15:26.511 --> 01:15:27.811]  I don't go off of dreams.
[01:15:28.231 --> 01:15:38.254]  I have seen people out there take what somebody dreams as more important than... Let's say somebody has a dream where they envision concentration camps.
[01:15:38.674 --> 01:15:43.395]  The person travels the country giving big speeches for people paying $100 a pop.
[01:15:44.015 --> 01:15:49.837]  Then we have the Houston Chronicle openly talking about camps and how they're good for us, and the average patriot isn't even aware of it.
[01:15:50.537 --> 01:15:53.377]  But at the same time, I talk about dreams.
[01:15:54.538 --> 01:15:55.218]  About 10 years ago,
[01:15:57.586 --> 01:16:02.289]  It may have even been longer than that, probably 12 years ago, before I even got into this movement and got on the air.
[01:16:04.611 --> 01:16:08.754]  Well, to be accurate, I was politically involved 14 years ago, got on the air about 11 and a half years ago.
[01:16:08.774 --> 01:16:09.174]  There you go.
[01:16:09.214 --> 01:16:16.339]  But before I was on the air, I had this dream where I was going to visit my aunt and uncle in Fredericksburg.
[01:16:16.439 --> 01:16:21.162]  Now, at that time, they had lived in San Antonio and had just moved to Llano.
[01:16:21.562 --> 01:16:23.103]  They didn't live in Fredericksburg.
[01:16:23.483 --> 01:16:25.385]  I'd only been to Fredericksburg a few times in my life.
[01:16:25.885 --> 01:16:27.206]  Didn't have family there at the time.
[01:16:27.890 --> 01:16:36.652]  And you're driving into Fredericksburg, and there are Mexican troops with some other type of white European troops searching all of the cars.
[01:16:37.973 --> 01:16:40.533]  And in the dream, I've got a family with me.
[01:16:40.573 --> 01:16:41.694]  Now, I didn't know my wife then.
[01:16:41.734 --> 01:16:42.754]  I didn't have children with me.
[01:16:44.234 --> 01:16:46.635]  In the dream, and it was one of those dreams where you wake up sweating.
[01:16:46.675 --> 01:16:48.315]  It was like, man, that dream was important.
[01:16:48.695 --> 01:16:50.656]  I've had very few of those, and frankly...
[01:16:51.480 --> 01:16:52.200]  We're good to go.
[01:16:52.220 --> 01:16:52.821]  We're good to go.
[01:17:11.596 --> 01:17:22.605]  And in the dream, it's a checkpoint, I can't get out of it, and the car's rolling to a stop, I'm stepping out with an assault rifle in my hand, and then I wake up from the dream.
[01:17:23.345 --> 01:17:32.232]  I mean, I know this is the enemy, I know I can't let them get my family, and the car's rolling to a stop, I'm pushing the door out in front of me, I'm bringing up an HK-91.
[01:17:32.372 --> 01:17:35.635]  Now that's serious, folks.
[01:17:36.075 --> 01:17:39.098]  And you wake up from the dream, I had it several times, and...
[01:17:40.234 --> 01:17:42.615]  In the dream, you see Mexican troops with people pulled over.
[01:17:42.635 --> 01:17:43.436]  They've got army trucks.
[01:17:43.456 --> 01:17:44.396]  They're putting people in them.
[01:17:45.417 --> 01:17:51.940]  And then now, fast forward, three years ago, they sign a joint forces agreement with Canada and Mexico, Associated Press.
[01:17:52.240 --> 01:17:58.103]  Foreign troops to, quote, be used to deal with natural disasters and American terrorists patrolling the U.S.
[01:17:58.703 --> 01:18:02.505]  Then after 9-1-1, a week later, I see General McKenzie, head U.N.
[01:18:02.545 --> 01:18:06.467]  peacekeeping general, on nightline saying they're going to use foreign troops to patrol America.
[01:18:07.700 --> 01:18:09.901]  Mexican trips are then used in New Orleans.
[01:18:10.421 --> 01:18:14.864]  Foreign NATO AWACS in our skies and F-16s after 9-11.
[01:18:14.944 --> 01:18:16.464]  All these agreements being signed.
[01:18:16.825 --> 01:18:18.506]  I go to urban warfare training drills.
[01:18:18.566 --> 01:18:24.889]  I videotape Marines with foreign troops trying to take over our cities and take our guns and admitting it's for here in America.
[01:18:28.531 --> 01:18:31.072]  So, I don't know what that dream was.
[01:18:31.232 --> 01:18:32.733]  And I don't like to go off of dreams.
[01:18:32.753 --> 01:18:33.673]  But let me tell you something.
[01:18:34.333 --> 01:18:37.235]  It had the same feel and texture as those other two I've had.
[01:18:39.033 --> 01:18:39.835]  And they come true.
[01:18:41.217 --> 01:18:50.195]  Let's not let it come true, ladies and gentlemen, because in that dream I was raising that weapon to engage that enemy.
[01:18:54.059 --> 01:19:02.668]  Berkey water filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[01:19:02.888 --> 01:19:14.179]  The Berkey Light self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, salt for odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[01:19:14.379 --> 01:19:17.042]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:19:17.362 --> 01:19:23.828]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled and it can be used anywhere on a flat surface.
[01:19:23.988 --> 01:19:25.870]  That's because it has an elevated base.
[01:19:26.070 --> 01:19:32.095]  The entire system joins together to make the Berkey Light convenient to transport even while it's filtering water.
[01:19:32.335 --> 01:19:38.000]  Its rechargeable bright white LED lamps allow for optimum use at night or during emergency conditions.
[01:19:38.320 --> 01:19:42.266]  Get the Berkey Light, the ultimate filter for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:19:42.286 --> 01:19:42.987]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[01:19:43.007 --> 01:19:43.688]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:19:55.994 --> 01:19:57.055]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:19:57.455 --> 01:20:02.939]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[01:20:03.500 --> 01:20:04.000]  That's right.
[01:20:04.320 --> 01:20:06.602]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[01:20:07.163 --> 01:20:14.088]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[01:20:14.648 --> 01:20:22.334]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds, and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[01:20:22.774 --> 01:20:27.578]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[01:20:28.260 --> 01:20:33.282]  If you'd like to take a look at gold free retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[01:20:34.063 --> 01:20:38.204]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[01:20:38.584 --> 01:20:38.825]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:20:38.845 --> 01:20:40.785]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[01:20:40.845 --> 01:20:41.146]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:20:41.446 --> 01:20:41.726]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:20:54.005 --> 01:20:56.426]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[01:20:56.446 --> 01:21:08.053]  Did you know that a semi-secret organization called the Council on Foreign Relations was founded in 1921 by Marxist Colonel Edward Mandel House, who was a personal advisor to President Woodrow Wilson?
[01:21:08.774 --> 01:21:14.117]  Its objective was to capture the foreign policy section of the State Department to help direct U.S.
[01:21:14.177 --> 01:21:17.959]  influence in the overthrow of targeted nations for communism.
[01:21:18.837 --> 01:21:19.238]  We're good to go.
[01:21:38.018 --> 01:21:39.479]  Just call our toll-free number, 1-800-516-8736.
[01:21:39.559 --> 01:21:39.819]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[01:21:39.839 --> 01:21:42.722]  Operators are standing by to receive your call.
[01:21:42.742 --> 01:21:45.045]  Do you know the truth about breast cancer?
[01:21:45.085 --> 01:21:48.348]  Did you know that the race for the cure is over?
[01:22:01.448 --> 01:22:09.335]  The best kept secret in the country today is that it is now possible to kill cancer without personal suffering, mutilation, and poisoning of your entire system.
[01:22:09.555 --> 01:22:12.197]  Now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaysMed, Inc.'
[01:22:12.177 --> 01:22:13.598]  's patented methodology.
[01:22:13.758 --> 01:22:20.704]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation, we can destroy tumors of any size without adverse side effects.
[01:22:20.944 --> 01:22:23.947]  At a physician's office, Star Wars technology at its best.
[01:22:24.287 --> 01:22:25.488]  We're good to go.
[01:22:25.748 --> 01:22:26.608]  We're good to go.
[01:22:56.585 --> 01:23:02.619]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:23:03.221 --> 01:23:06.187]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:23:07.889 --> 01:23:11.411]  Adding to the foreign troops invading America, this isn't a joke.
[01:23:11.431 --> 01:23:14.232]  I mean, there are really preparations for this going on.
[01:23:14.272 --> 01:23:15.112]  We can't ignore them.
[01:23:15.352 --> 01:23:18.953]  I don't know if it's really going to happen, but they've signed the agreements.
[01:23:19.714 --> 01:23:20.774]  The training is happening.
[01:23:21.054 --> 01:23:22.955]  They're admitting it's for domestic operations.
[01:23:23.015 --> 01:23:26.756]  And then I have two different border sheriffs on on Monday, remember?
[01:23:27.196 --> 01:23:30.738]  And one of them down there in Laredo admits that they videotaped.
[01:23:30.758 --> 01:23:31.718]  This has been on the web.
[01:23:32.518 --> 01:23:33.559]  Chinese troops...
[01:23:34.631 --> 01:23:36.272]  They found their patches as well.
[01:23:36.952 --> 01:23:39.152]  Some type of Slavic-European troops.
[01:23:40.193 --> 01:23:45.874]  I've got Associated Press here where Russia is going to build a military helicopter factory in Mexico.
[01:23:46.615 --> 01:23:49.736]  There's Chinese troops moving into Latin America, into Panama.
[01:23:50.216 --> 01:23:51.956]  I mean, this is really going on.
[01:23:51.996 --> 01:23:57.238]  The Communist Chinese really are going to run the nuclear scanning equipment there in the Bahamas at the biggest port.
[01:23:57.896 --> 01:24:00.197]  You can't make this type of stuff up.
[01:24:00.498 --> 01:24:01.898]  It's really going on.
[01:24:02.419 --> 01:24:05.280]  Red Dawn in slow motion.
[01:24:05.820 --> 01:24:08.282]  Let's continue with the calls, and I'm going to get into the border after the break.
[01:24:08.602 --> 01:24:10.203]  Tom in Florida, you're on the air.
[01:24:10.223 --> 01:24:10.743]  Hi, Alex.
[01:24:10.783 --> 01:24:11.724]  How are you doing?
[01:24:11.804 --> 01:24:12.084]  Good.
[01:24:12.464 --> 01:24:20.388]  Hey, Alex, that just reminded me, a couple years ago, the Chicago Onion was a sort of comical newspaper release date.
[01:24:20.508 --> 01:24:21.909]  I know what it is, yeah.
[01:24:21.929 --> 01:24:23.490]  Yeah, they had one story about...
[01:24:25.373 --> 01:24:33.196]  The UN sending peacekeepers to Washington, and you see Serbian forces in front of Washington.
[01:24:33.236 --> 01:24:39.599]  It was kind of comical at the time, but scary in relation to what's really going on.
[01:24:39.679 --> 01:24:41.019]  Well, if there's a big enough terror attack...
[01:24:43.352 --> 01:24:43.572]  Oh yeah.
[01:24:43.592 --> 01:24:43.712]  Yeah.
[01:25:12.697 --> 01:25:13.678]  Go ahead.
[01:25:13.818 --> 01:25:17.320]  Hey, I had two sort of quick questions.
[01:25:18.300 --> 01:25:19.641]  And this is to you and your users.
[01:25:20.561 --> 01:25:25.564]  First one is over at loosechange911.com.
[01:25:25.644 --> 01:25:32.748]  If you click on forum site and you go to the user's lounge, you can find an entry that says this.
[01:25:32.808 --> 01:25:35.189]  And I wanted to get your comment on this.
[01:25:35.350 --> 01:25:37.811]  It says, 1967 audio recording that will blow your mind.
[01:25:38.511 --> 01:25:41.453]  It's as if everything we are experiencing today has happened before.
[01:25:42.079 --> 01:25:44.881]  Yes, I've heard the famous Illuminati album he put out.
[01:25:45.021 --> 01:25:46.321]  Anthony Hilder produced it.
[01:26:06.164 --> 01:26:08.366]  And we have played clips of it here on air.
[01:26:08.806 --> 01:26:13.370]  Why don't you send me the link to that, and we'll put a link up to it on InfoWars.com.
[01:26:13.551 --> 01:26:13.791]  Sure.
[01:26:14.051 --> 01:26:14.912]  That's awesome.
[01:26:15.732 --> 01:26:17.654]  The second one, Alex, is a little more personal.
[01:26:18.255 --> 01:26:22.258]  Back in the late 90s, I was a third-level support tech at a company called Signature Group.
[01:26:23.259 --> 01:26:24.520]  They were purchased by GE.
[01:26:25.801 --> 01:26:28.043]  It became GE Financial Assurance after that.
[01:26:28.183 --> 01:26:29.384]  And I'm talking about late 96, early 98.
[01:26:29.945 --> 01:26:30.025]  Well...
[01:26:33.214 --> 01:26:39.120]  One of my duties there was to actually map out the network to look for rogue routers, this sort of stuff.
[01:26:39.941 --> 01:26:41.663]  So me and a small team actually did that.
[01:26:42.303 --> 01:26:46.948]  But the thing is, we went a little further and we took a look at the transport routes going out of the company.
[01:26:47.691 --> 01:26:52.473]  Just to give you an idea of what the company does, they process credit card transactions.
[01:26:52.573 --> 01:26:58.194]  And let me guess, everything going out was then routed through an NSA piece of equipment?
[01:26:58.394 --> 01:26:59.215]  That's absolutely right.
[01:27:00.215 --> 01:27:03.796]  And we did report that to our supervisors, and they shut us up.
[01:27:06.715 --> 01:27:08.756]  And you said this was in the mid-90s?
[01:27:08.857 --> 01:27:11.579]  Actually, I was there between 1997 and 1998.
[01:27:11.839 --> 01:27:13.100]  Yeah, let me just break down.
[01:27:13.420 --> 01:27:14.702]  You see, nothing's really secret.
[01:27:14.742 --> 01:27:19.406]  They can pass a secret law or have a secret regulation or have a secret program.
[01:27:19.986 --> 01:27:23.649]  And that's wrong to say secret law, but secret operation, black world op.
[01:27:24.110 --> 01:27:31.956]  But it's going to be an industry publication because it's going to be implemented, and the implementation on the ground level will be visible of the larger program.
[01:27:31.976 --> 01:27:36.860]  Then you can look at the full spectrum of the operation and find out what the exact orders were.
[01:27:36.920 --> 01:27:37.541]  But let me tell you.
[01:27:38.181 --> 01:27:42.962]  It is public, it's been public, that every communication is routed through the NSA.
[01:27:43.422 --> 01:27:45.703]  Starting in 96, they put the hubs in.
[01:27:46.143 --> 01:27:50.864]  Every phone company, every company, by law, has been paid to do it, by the way.
[01:27:50.884 --> 01:27:52.964]  Because they said, well, how can it be a law if we have to pay for it?
[01:27:53.344 --> 01:27:58.145]  So the government puts its own offices with NSA officers in every major company.
[01:27:58.425 --> 01:28:05.707]  And now that's come out in the AT&T in San Francisco with a whole floor of the building, basically, NSA offices.
[01:28:06.467 --> 01:28:12.732]  Again, that's why when Hayden gets up there and says we're just listening to foreign Al-Qaeda calls, it's total bull.
[01:28:14.153 --> 01:28:15.073]  But I want to hear more.
[01:28:15.093 --> 01:28:19.136]  You want to tell us more about how it was all finally routed through this piece of equipment?
[01:28:19.156 --> 01:28:19.496]  Sure.
[01:28:20.557 --> 01:28:22.538]  Stay there briefly and comment on it on the other side.
[01:28:22.558 --> 01:28:23.299]  I don't want to interrupt.
[01:28:23.919 --> 01:28:24.740]  Why did I interrupt?
[01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:26.441]  Why did I finish his sentence for him?
[01:28:27.153 --> 01:28:29.074]  Because I know a lot of you won't check out what I claim.
[01:28:29.375 --> 01:28:30.015]  You don't do that.
[01:28:30.075 --> 01:28:30.675]  I wish you did.
[01:28:31.136 --> 01:28:39.321]  But see, if I can finish generals' statements, and I can finish congressmen's statements, if I can finish this caller's statement, you see, you find out my knowledge is real.
[01:28:39.761 --> 01:28:40.582]  It's not pretended.
[01:28:44.284 --> 01:28:45.205]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.685 --> 01:28:47.286]  The empire's on the run.
[01:28:48.207 --> 01:28:50.909]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.897 --> 01:28:58.340]  If you think your engine is safe by having the oil changed every 3,000 miles, think again.
[01:28:58.620 --> 01:29:02.203]  Every time you start your car, your engine creates friction between the moving parts.
[01:29:02.343 --> 01:29:10.469]  These moving parts wear against each other, and the result is small metal particles circulating through your oil, causing premature wear and damage to your engine.
[01:29:10.729 --> 01:29:16.353]  Oil filters do a good job of trapping the large metal particles, but they will not trap the most harmful tiny particles.
[01:29:16.653 --> 01:29:21.897]  These tiny particles circulate constantly through your oil, and over time your engine begins to show signs of wear.
[01:29:22.157 --> 01:29:24.259]  This is why you need the filter mag.
[01:29:24.519 --> 01:29:36.669]  The filter mag is a powerful magnet that holds itself to the outside of your oil filter, trapping the tiny metal particles to the inside wall of the filter, extending the life of your oil and ultimately extending the life of your engine.
[01:29:36.889 --> 01:29:41.313]  The reusable FilterMag is maintenance-free, installs in two seconds, and lasts forever.
[01:29:41.533 --> 01:29:42.474]  So what are you waiting for?
[01:29:42.674 --> 01:29:44.296]  Go to FilterMag.com.
[01:29:44.416 --> 01:29:46.217]  That's FilterMag.com.
[01:29:46.478 --> 01:29:46.938]  Or call 800-345-8376.
[01:29:46.958 --> 01:29:47.158]  That's 800-345-8376.
[01:29:54.091 --> 01:30:02.333]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[01:30:02.593 --> 01:30:06.954]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[01:30:07.234 --> 01:30:16.156]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[01:30:16.356 --> 01:30:19.977]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[01:30:20.277 --> 01:30:25.304]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[01:30:25.604 --> 01:30:32.353]  Hospitals, restaurants and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria.
[01:30:32.834 --> 01:30:33.355]  What about you?
[01:30:33.973 --> 01:30:34.493]  Call now to order at 1-888-803-4438.

[01:31:54.856 --> 01:31:57.658]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:31:58.179 --> 01:32:01.542]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:32:02.863 --> 01:32:05.586]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:32:05.646 --> 01:32:09.029]  Thank you so much for riding shotgun today with us.
[01:32:09.756 --> 01:32:13.918]  As we attempt to defend the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[01:32:13.978 --> 01:32:20.182]  As we expose the globalist slave grid that's being put in.
[01:32:20.242 --> 01:32:23.483]  Now, in 1996, a Telecommunications Act was passed.
[01:32:24.344 --> 01:32:26.265]  Nine billion dollars was supposed to be six.
[01:32:26.305 --> 01:32:30.007]  By 2000, it was nine billion, and I haven't looked at cost overruns since.
[01:32:31.187 --> 01:32:31.728]  We're good to go.
[01:32:47.167 --> 01:32:56.234]  Had to have all the boards and all the wiring finally go into this final piece of equipment, the EAS system, for, quote, emergency alerts.
[01:32:56.314 --> 01:32:58.856]  The official telecommunications plan.
[01:32:58.936 --> 01:33:04.681]  I had FCC lawyers on this show, both retired and current.
[01:33:05.370 --> 01:33:14.172]  And they said that, yes, the plan since the mid-80s would be the government will end up having about one hour of programming a day, and they will break in whenever they wish.
[01:33:14.612 --> 01:33:15.873]  People laughed at me about this.
[01:33:15.933 --> 01:33:21.874]  Then finally, two years ago, engineers and others started walking up to me at stations I was in, visiting, or people I knew at restaurants.
[01:33:21.914 --> 01:33:25.315]  They'd come up and go, Alex, you're right, we're getting memos, and they're going to start cutting in.
[01:33:26.076 --> 01:33:28.038]  But see, how do they introduce it to you at first?
[01:33:28.198 --> 01:33:31.921]  Oh, it's going to be an Amber Alert, starting in Dallas, for only kidnapped children.
[01:33:31.941 --> 01:33:33.242]  And then, oh, for wildfires.
[01:33:33.262 --> 01:33:34.162]  Well, that sounds reasonable.
[01:33:34.503 --> 01:33:37.325]  And, oh, then reports about turning in illegal guns.
[01:33:37.405 --> 01:33:40.287]  And, oh, then reports about how to be a good environmentalist.
[01:33:40.327 --> 01:33:43.149]  And then, oh, little Homeland Security announcements.
[01:33:43.189 --> 01:33:46.632]  And then, well, we'll work with your station and tell you when we'll be breaking in.
[01:33:46.872 --> 01:33:47.853]  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!
[01:33:48.253 --> 01:33:50.815]  And the National Association of Broadcasters agrees with it.
[01:33:51.335 --> 01:33:52.616]  The government taking over.
[01:33:52.656 --> 01:33:56.458]  They can hit one switch and take over via satellite or shortwave.
[01:33:56.478 --> 01:34:01.280]  They have satellite relay towers that cut in with high power into your local systems.
[01:34:01.300 --> 01:34:07.524]  They can have local propaganda, national propaganda, UHF TV, VHF TV, all the cable systems.
[01:34:07.564 --> 01:34:10.485]  They can shut the internet off, shut parts of the internet off.
[01:34:10.785 --> 01:34:12.026]  Everything's run through a grid.
[01:34:12.046 --> 01:34:15.628]  Your TiVo systems build psychological algorithms.
[01:34:16.454 --> 01:34:22.182]  They have different psychological tests they give you when you're going to the CIA, you're going to be a cop, or you're going to work as an executive at a corporation.
[01:34:22.202 --> 01:34:25.807]  It's a 600-something question test that tries to catch you in lies.
[01:34:27.020 --> 01:34:39.169]  Well, they have said that actually watching your TV viewing habits and scoring different parts of TV shows and even national commercials, they all have a psychological score number, and it's a very complex computer system that then calculates all this.
[01:34:39.210 --> 01:34:41.832]  They get your total psychological makeup.
[01:34:42.032 --> 01:34:47.416]  They can then use that for general propaganda uses against certain sectors of the society or entire regions.
[01:34:47.736 --> 01:34:51.139]  They then get to personally have a giant file on you.
[01:34:51.639 --> 01:34:54.560]  And I remember reading about this in industry publications eight years ago.
[01:34:54.620 --> 01:34:57.680]  Now it's been in the Chicago Tribune, USA Today, you name it.
[01:34:57.920 --> 01:35:05.322]  Every time you call to order a pizza from one of the major chains, they're getting 20% of any fees or fines from your arrest or any awards.
[01:35:05.722 --> 01:35:11.943]  A Dallas private company that's a known NSA front, run by the former number two man at the NSA, runs the entire system.
[01:35:12.163 --> 01:35:15.423]  When you order a pizza, they run a background check on you and call the police.
[01:35:15.683 --> 01:35:17.484]  You get a SWAT team raid instead.
[01:35:17.844 --> 01:35:19.064]  Meanwhile, Hayden!
[01:35:19.104 --> 01:35:20.787]  I'm so sick of these people!
[01:35:32.549 --> 01:35:35.691]  The NSA flagged hundreds of communications.
[01:35:35.951 --> 01:35:38.552]  We've interviewed some of the people that looked at those communications.
[01:35:38.793 --> 01:35:40.574]  And it was our government dealing drugs.
[01:35:40.914 --> 01:35:42.375]  Our government in white slavery.
[01:35:42.635 --> 01:35:47.117]  Our government selling rockets and missile parts and nuclear weapons parts.
[01:35:47.578 --> 01:35:48.038]  Okay?
[01:35:48.318 --> 01:35:50.199]  Our government controlling Al-Qaeda.
[01:35:50.439 --> 01:35:54.802]  Our government controlling murder squads and organized crime worldwide.
[01:35:55.062 --> 01:35:56.563]  That's what's in the NSA.
[01:35:56.863 --> 01:36:00.445]  And every time an analyst gets into a compartmentalized area, they're not supposed to be.
[01:36:01.295 --> 01:36:03.577]  And starts calling for this to be exposed.
[01:36:03.597 --> 01:36:04.757]  They die in a car wreck.
[01:36:04.797 --> 01:36:05.658]  They go to prison.
[01:36:05.878 --> 01:36:06.719]  They get indicted.
[01:36:06.779 --> 01:36:07.579]  They get fired.
[01:36:07.619 --> 01:36:09.100]  They get told to shut up.
[01:36:09.761 --> 01:36:13.563]  The NSA picked up so much chatter on 9-11, it was ridiculous.
[01:36:14.023 --> 01:36:18.847]  And do you know what the rest of the NSA and Defense Intelligence and Naval Intelligence and the rest of them were told?
[01:36:20.007 --> 01:36:21.869]  They were told it's all part of drills.
[01:36:22.109 --> 01:36:23.850]  You're picking up chatter on drills.
[01:36:24.110 --> 01:36:25.531]  These men aren't terrorists.
[01:36:25.751 --> 01:36:26.972]  They're really government agents.
[01:36:26.992 --> 01:36:28.173]  They're not hijackers.
[01:36:31.229 --> 01:36:38.616]  That's another reason they have these drills, is so when NSA and InfoPoll9 and others pick this up, it doesn't matter anymore.
[01:36:38.656 --> 01:36:42.219]  It's just, we've got criminals running the country.
[01:36:43.801 --> 01:36:44.822]  Okay, okay, settle down.
[01:36:45.623 --> 01:36:47.224]  I just, you know what, no, I shouldn't settle down.
[01:36:47.524 --> 01:36:51.168]  This country is going to Hades in a handbasket, and I'm angry about it.
[01:36:52.771 --> 01:36:53.751]  We should all be angry.
[01:36:53.791 --> 01:37:00.634]  Tom, in Florida, you were working as an IT security specialist in a Fortune 500 company, checking their network security.
[01:37:00.674 --> 01:37:04.035]  You found some really serious breaches, and, of course, it was NSA hubs.
[01:37:04.075 --> 01:37:04.815]  Tell us all about it.
[01:37:05.275 --> 01:37:13.078]  Well, Alex, there's not a ton to tell, but, yeah, we were part of a team that was just supposed to map out our network.
[01:37:13.098 --> 01:37:16.219]  There was a lot of movement in the company, you know, during that time.
[01:37:16.259 --> 01:37:17.079]  There was a lot of growth.
[01:37:17.119 --> 01:37:18.540]  We were preparing for Y2K, etc., etc., etc.,
[01:37:19.798 --> 01:37:24.080]  So I was part of a team that actually mapped out the network.
[01:37:24.300 --> 01:37:26.560]  And what we did, we didn't know we weren't supposed to do this.
[01:37:27.341 --> 01:37:30.382]  We actually started looking at the transport systems outside of the network.
[01:37:30.882 --> 01:37:35.083]  And what we discovered is that there were tunnels to NSA-related equipment.
[01:37:35.103 --> 01:37:36.424]  They were actually NSA-owned.
[01:37:36.484 --> 01:37:37.064]  We looked them up.
[01:37:37.744 --> 01:37:43.146]  And what we did is we put a sniffer on the piece of equipment that was communicating back and forth.
[01:37:43.686 --> 01:37:45.247]  And this was outside this firewall.
[01:37:47.129 --> 01:37:50.550]  What that does is chronicle the movement, what info is being accessed.
[01:37:50.970 --> 01:37:51.631]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:37:51.651 --> 01:37:54.632]  You could actually see the information being sent and received.
[01:37:55.533 --> 01:37:57.093]  Unfortunately, the information was encrypted.
[01:37:57.173 --> 01:38:02.036]  We weren't able to take it a step further because our supervisor shut us down.
[01:38:03.236 --> 01:38:04.537]  He was a cool cat.
[01:38:04.797 --> 01:38:06.778]  Actually, back in the day, he was part of 2600.
[01:38:07.578 --> 01:38:08.359]  Pretty nice guy.
[01:38:08.619 --> 01:38:12.641]  I don't think he ever reported it to his seniors, but he did freak out about it.
[01:38:12.681 --> 01:38:13.401]  I do remember that.
[01:38:14.324 --> 01:38:16.525]  And, you know, it was pretty serious stuff.
[01:38:17.446 --> 01:38:18.707]  Well, I appreciate your call.
[01:38:18.747 --> 01:38:19.227]  God bless.
[01:38:19.247 --> 01:38:20.227]  Thanks for the info.
[01:38:20.468 --> 01:38:22.208]  It just confirms what's already confirmed.
[01:38:22.809 --> 01:38:24.830]  But let me explain something, too.
[01:38:24.910 --> 01:38:28.412]  This was actually in industry publications at the time, and that's what I mainly read.
[01:38:29.999 --> 01:38:32.061]  Y2K was several things.
[01:38:32.261 --> 01:38:36.424]  And it was the government, it was the Naval Report that caused the fear.
[01:38:36.604 --> 01:38:40.667]  And the government tried to blame the media after it didn't happen.
[01:38:40.907 --> 01:38:44.669]  Within six months of it happening, I thought the whole thing was a fraud and a shut-up.
[01:38:44.709 --> 01:38:48.412]  Of course, I got criticized by people who were out there profiteering from it.
[01:38:49.079 --> 01:38:57.346]  But it was an excuse at the local level to put in FEMA command bunkers and emergency management centers for federal control of future emergencies they would create.
[01:38:57.366 --> 01:39:03.891]  The big Building 7, the 9-11 command base, where they carried out that attack and the rest of it a year later.
[01:39:05.472 --> 01:39:12.737]  But Y2K was also a smokescreen for all this NSA equipment to finally be put in and completed in late 1999.
[01:39:14.399 --> 01:39:15.540]  And so that's what's going on.
[01:39:16.520 --> 01:39:17.261]  And that's what's happening.
[01:39:18.949 --> 01:39:29.471]  Talking about foreign troops and the takeover of America, here's a little video game commercial, Shattered Union, where they, and there's hundreds of games I've seen like this, where UN troops take over America.
[01:39:29.491 --> 01:39:32.732]  I don't think there are many video games about warfare in the U.S.
[01:39:32.752 --> 01:39:34.673]  that aren't about the UN coming in and taking over.
[01:39:35.093 --> 01:39:37.653]  Let's roll this, and then we'll go into the news and warrior calls.
[01:39:38.693 --> 01:39:40.874]  Following a disputed election and a tie vote...
[01:39:41.696 --> 01:39:42.136]  The U.S.
[01:39:42.196 --> 01:39:45.239]  Congress installs the most unpopular president in U.S.
[01:39:45.279 --> 01:39:50.503]  history as David Jefferson Adams becomes the 44th president of the United States.
[01:39:51.083 --> 01:39:58.990]  Shortly after the election, increased unrest, rioting, and a growing number of militias have given rise to ever-increasing domestic terrorism.
[01:40:00.971 --> 01:40:08.037]  In response, the president invokes the Homeland Security Act and declares martial law on the West Coast and other areas of the country.
[01:40:08.664 --> 01:40:16.865]  Though highly contested, a Supreme Court ruling sidesteps the electoral process, disqualifying popular presidential candidates from several states.
[01:40:18.026 --> 01:40:24.987]  Public outrage explodes when a sham election leads to incumbent David Adams accepting a second term in office.
[01:40:27.167 --> 01:40:31.048]  During the 57th Inauguration Day ceremonies, Washington D.C.
[01:40:31.128 --> 01:40:36.589]  is struck by a low-yield nuclear weapon, killing David Adams and most of the U.S.
[01:40:36.629 --> 01:40:36.949]  Congress.
[01:40:39.136 --> 01:40:41.156]  The destruction of Washington, D.C.
[01:40:41.597 --> 01:40:45.457]  effectively breaks the chain of succession, sending the nation into chaos.
[01:40:46.197 --> 01:40:51.319]  In an emergency vote, the European Union deploys peacekeepers in the greater D.C.
[01:40:51.479 --> 01:40:53.919]  area to secure international interests.
[01:40:55.339 --> 01:41:02.681]  With separatist sentiment rising, California's governor declares home rule and secedes from the Union.
[01:41:03.576 --> 01:41:10.663]  Texas follows quickly and declares sovereignty, taking neighboring states with them and forming the Republic of Texas.
[01:41:12.624 --> 01:41:18.970]  Now, the once United States of America lie in ruin.
[01:41:20.652 --> 01:41:29.160]  The time for words has passed, and the Second American Civil War now erupts as seven factions wage war across the land.
[01:41:30.782 --> 01:41:33.486]  They battle one another to reclaim a nation.
[01:41:34.768 --> 01:41:35.869]  To restore peace.
[01:41:37.211 --> 01:41:40.335]  To rebuild this shattered union.
[01:41:44.141 --> 01:41:46.204]  That's even more powerful when you watch the video.
[01:41:47.518 --> 01:41:51.442]  The globalists basically like to have the equivalent of a heart plug.
[01:41:51.462 --> 01:42:01.232]  You ever seen that movie, Dune, where the evil Baron Vladimir Harkonnen has a little plug he pulls out of somebody's chest and it opens up their carotid artery, or I guess that'd be there.
[01:42:01.252 --> 01:42:06.117]  What's the big, the carotids are in the neck, what's the big one that's on the top of the heart?
[01:42:06.958 --> 01:42:08.640]  It'll pop in my head in a moment, doesn't matter.
[01:42:09.597 --> 01:42:12.558]  And the blood comes spilling out.
[01:42:13.178 --> 01:42:15.459]  America has been fitted with a heart plug.
[01:42:16.259 --> 01:42:18.500]  The globalists can punch a button and nukes will go off.
[01:42:18.520 --> 01:42:27.543]  They can punch a button and aircraft pilots will get in their helicopters and fixed wing aircraft and take off thinking they're doing one more bacterial test.
[01:42:27.563 --> 01:42:29.964]  They'll really be spraying a deadly bioweapon or nerve gas.
[01:42:30.644 --> 01:42:31.265]  We're good to go.
[01:42:57.463 --> 01:43:01.825]  500 Special Forces troops can bring this country to its knees just like that.
[01:43:01.885 --> 01:43:03.165]  You snap your fingers.
[01:43:03.806 --> 01:43:05.586]  They blow up a major building in every city.
[01:43:05.666 --> 01:43:06.627]  Panic will ensue.
[01:43:06.867 --> 01:43:16.951]  These Lexus-driving spoiled brat yuppies will come into frothing demons that'll sell you and your family out for a Tim badge as a Homeland Security block chief just to get more food.
[01:43:18.811 --> 01:43:22.413]  I'm sorry to have to get like this sometimes, but this is what's really going on.
[01:43:22.713 --> 01:43:24.053]  This is what we're really facing.
[01:43:24.293 --> 01:43:25.994]  This is what this country's turned into.
[01:43:27.851 --> 01:43:30.212]  We're living in the twilight zone, and I'm sick of it.
[01:43:31.413 --> 01:43:32.233]  Bunch of crooks.
[01:43:32.353 --> 01:43:33.874]  Bunch of bloodthirsty crooks.
[01:43:34.194 --> 01:43:36.015]  And I'm not saying they're going to release a nuke.
[01:43:36.335 --> 01:43:38.016]  I'm not saying they're going to release a bio.
[01:43:38.256 --> 01:43:40.477]  I'm not saying they're going to have the illegals burn the cities down.
[01:43:40.677 --> 01:43:45.160]  But let me tell you, they're in control of all those factions, and they're certainly threatening that it's going to happen.
[01:43:45.180 --> 01:43:46.380]  They're saying it's going to happen.
[01:43:52.883 --> 01:43:53.984]  Let's go ahead and talk to...
[01:43:55.563 --> 01:43:58.144]  Let's go ahead and talk to Bobby in California.
[01:43:58.184 --> 01:43:59.105]  Bobby, you're on the air.
[01:43:59.125 --> 01:44:04.768]  Do you think the globalists are going to make 6606 a day to remember?
[01:44:05.228 --> 01:44:05.509]  I don't know.
[01:44:05.549 --> 01:44:06.969]  Everybody's been saying that for a year.
[01:44:07.650 --> 01:44:09.110]  The globalists are into numerology.
[01:44:09.131 --> 01:44:09.871]  311, three years after 9-11.
[01:44:12.975 --> 01:44:16.436]  911 days after 9-11.
[01:44:16.456 --> 01:44:17.616]  7-7, 7-21, 9-11.
[01:44:18.136 --> 01:44:20.597]  All the weird 9-11 combinations on 9-11.
[01:44:20.877 --> 01:44:21.517]  It's their number.
[01:44:21.557 --> 01:44:22.037]  It's the government.
[01:44:22.057 --> 01:44:22.817]  It's who you call.
[01:44:22.837 --> 01:44:24.038]  9-11 happened.
[01:44:24.058 --> 01:44:24.618]  Call the government.
[01:44:24.638 --> 01:44:25.138]  They'll save you.
[01:44:25.158 --> 01:44:26.098]  They'll take all your rights.
[01:44:26.978 --> 01:44:28.819]  Their religion is numerology.
[01:44:28.839 --> 01:44:30.239]  We've had professors on about that.
[01:44:30.259 --> 01:44:33.720]  Our government buildings are built in satanic calculations.
[01:44:34.140 --> 01:44:34.700]  It's all true.
[01:44:34.720 --> 01:44:34.800]  Yeah.
[01:44:36.041 --> 01:44:36.881]  I don't know what's going to happen.
[01:44:37.201 --> 01:44:37.761]  Probably nothing.
[01:44:37.781 --> 01:44:38.061]  Who knows?
[01:44:39.341 --> 01:44:41.862]  And I was thinking maybe you could sell a blank...
[01:44:42.347 --> 01:44:47.011]  DVDs on your site, because I know a lot of people have trouble finding the longer DVDs.
[01:44:47.231 --> 01:44:54.636]  I think because if you buy, I think it's like, all I could find was at least like $100 for like $200 or something.
[01:44:55.297 --> 01:45:06.565]  Yeah, no, the bigger DVDs that you can copy a three-hour film onto are available at most Office Maxes or CompUSAs, and they're not that expensive, no.
[01:45:07.065 --> 01:45:07.305]  Oh, really?
[01:45:07.326 --> 01:45:07.406]  Okay.
[01:45:07.486 --> 01:45:08.927]  All right, thanks a lot.
[01:45:09.187 --> 01:45:09.547]  Thank you.
[01:45:09.587 --> 01:45:10.528]  I appreciate the call.
[01:45:11.741 --> 01:45:13.342]  Oh, let's just go to Kevin in Alabama.
[01:45:13.382 --> 01:45:14.023]  Kevin, go ahead.
[01:45:14.043 --> 01:45:14.543]  You're on the air.
[01:45:14.583 --> 01:45:15.484]  Hey, man.
[01:45:15.524 --> 01:45:16.164]  How's it going?
[01:45:17.125 --> 01:45:19.086]  Doing a radio talk show, and we just went to your call.
[01:45:19.106 --> 01:45:20.147]  All right.
[01:45:20.347 --> 01:45:26.551]  Well, a couple weeks ago, I called and said I got Charlie Sheen on a video at a Bilderberg meeting.
[01:45:26.911 --> 01:45:28.973]  I've got the video in my hand.
[01:45:29.153 --> 01:45:30.494]  I'd like to send it to you.
[01:45:30.614 --> 01:45:32.335]  Oh, you don't need to send it to me.
[01:45:32.535 --> 01:45:33.396]  I have the video.
[01:45:33.936 --> 01:45:36.458]  Listeners quickly uploaded it and mailed me hard copies.
[01:45:37.118 --> 01:45:40.260]  And it's an old man and another man, and it's not Charlie Sheen.
[01:45:40.300 --> 01:45:43.242]  A five-year-old could look at that and tell you it's not Charlie Sheen.
[01:45:43.322 --> 01:45:43.983]  But there's your proof.
[01:45:44.383 --> 01:45:50.687]  By the way, we have the list of all the members and attendees going back 27 years, sir, and Charlie Sheen ain't one of them.
[01:45:51.408 --> 01:45:52.248]  So nice try.
[01:45:52.628 --> 01:45:53.289]  Thanks for the call.
[01:45:54.029 --> 01:45:55.090]  I knew that was that, Kevin.
[01:45:55.690 --> 01:46:05.437]  It's so incredible to just... I mean, you see some show about the Bilderberg Group on Discovery Channel, and it's a guy with dark hair.
[01:46:06.673 --> 01:46:07.654]  But it doesn't stop him.
[01:46:09.035 --> 01:46:11.736]  So we don't need you to send that to us, sir.
[01:46:12.157 --> 01:46:12.577]  Thank you.
[01:46:13.558 --> 01:46:14.578]  Let's talk to Rick.
[01:46:14.658 --> 01:46:16.039]  Rick, where are you calling us from?
[01:46:16.059 --> 01:46:18.781]  Okay.
[01:46:19.281 --> 01:46:19.622]  Go ahead.
[01:46:19.642 --> 01:46:22.924]  Is Rick in Arizona?
[01:46:23.324 --> 01:46:24.785]  Yeah.
[01:46:25.265 --> 01:46:26.626]  We're trying to take your call right now.
[01:46:26.646 --> 01:46:28.227]  All right.
[01:46:28.407 --> 01:46:28.828]  Hey, Alex.
[01:46:28.888 --> 01:46:29.288]  Hey, man.
[01:46:30.569 --> 01:46:30.809]  You hear me?
[01:46:32.097 --> 01:46:33.018]  Thanks for the call, bro.
[01:46:33.338 --> 01:46:34.179]  Really appreciate it.
[01:46:34.459 --> 01:46:35.360]  Keith in Ohio.
[01:46:35.820 --> 01:46:36.601]  Keith, you're on the air.
[01:46:36.641 --> 01:46:36.961]  Welcome.
[01:46:37.161 --> 01:46:41.405]  Well, Alex, thanks for all your labor and bringing us truth to warn us of things to come.
[01:46:41.425 --> 01:46:46.409]  I wonder if you heard of a fellow named Peter Hammond out of South Africa?
[01:46:46.429 --> 01:46:48.350]  I have heard the name.
[01:46:48.410 --> 01:46:49.491]  I don't place it.
[01:46:49.691 --> 01:46:54.595]  There's a related ministry that has a lot of his books and stuff, intouchmission.org.
[01:46:54.916 --> 01:46:56.057]  It's located in America.
[01:46:56.677 --> 01:46:58.579]  Anyway, this fellow or one of his other...
[01:46:59.981 --> 01:47:00.241]  I think so.
[01:47:00.281 --> 01:47:00.641]  I think so.
[01:47:24.046 --> 01:47:29.869]  I mean, on the front line of what went on in Rwanda and Sudan and Mozambique, the killing fields and everything.
[01:47:29.889 --> 01:47:37.953]  I think it would be excellent to have on and how he's handled these things and how local people have handled them, you know, with the grace of the Lord in their hearts.
[01:47:37.993 --> 01:47:41.155]  No, that's people who've been through a New World War operation.
[01:47:41.175 --> 01:47:42.295]  Amen.
[01:47:42.375 --> 01:47:44.436]  And the globalists have openly orchestrated all this stuff.
[01:47:45.037 --> 01:47:47.478]  Send me a copy of one of the books or send me some contact info.
[01:47:47.878 --> 01:47:49.439]  Okay, there's another website.
[01:47:49.459 --> 01:47:51.600]  I don't know if you're familiar with Voice of the Martyrs.
[01:47:53.137 --> 01:47:54.038]  They're in Oklahoma.
[01:47:54.478 --> 01:48:00.041]  They've got persecution.com and persecution.org is another ministry, a third ministry there.
[01:48:00.221 --> 01:48:04.203]  And preparing spiritually, the main battle is for our mind and soul.
[01:48:04.223 --> 01:48:09.845]  And what we're looking at is this global beast system, just like with your Bohemian Grove research.
[01:48:11.306 --> 01:48:17.369]  Satanic religion, to one degree or another, is at the core of this, and that's the ultimate battle.
[01:48:18.129 --> 01:48:21.791]  And preparing our minds, and that's where we live at.
[01:48:24.535 --> 01:48:27.497]  Keep up the good work, and Lord's grace be with you.
[01:48:28.098 --> 01:48:28.498]  Thank you.
[01:48:28.558 --> 01:48:29.899]  I really appreciate your call.
[01:48:30.679 --> 01:48:32.441]  We're going to come back, and I'm going to get into immigration.
[01:48:32.461 --> 01:48:43.448]  I'm going to try to calmly and cogently go through what this new legislation really does and how they're staging it to have the illegals protest Bush when he openly controls them through a PR firm.
[01:48:43.888 --> 01:48:46.330]  He controls the predominant groups, the majority of them.
[01:48:46.952 --> 01:48:47.592]  We're good to go.
[01:48:47.612 --> 01:48:48.033]  We're good to go.
[01:49:17.276 --> 01:49:21.197]  I get upset about this because I've done the cold hard research.
[01:49:21.217 --> 01:49:30.201]  This is what I do hours and hours and hours every day and I cannot articulate clearly enough or properly how evil the New World Order is.
[01:49:30.281 --> 01:49:31.541]  How out of control they are.
[01:49:34.062 --> 01:49:40.684]  In fact, later in the next hour I may just cut our guests a little bit short next hour because I want to have some time to talk about what life under the New World Order will be like.
[01:49:42.365 --> 01:49:45.346]  And I want you to remember this broadcast many years from now.
[01:49:46.358 --> 01:49:50.443]  Alright, we'll be right back with a lot of other news, your calls, and so much more.
[01:49:55.228 --> 01:49:58.090]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[01:49:58.350 --> 01:49:59.911]  Hello, my friends, Alex Jones here.
[01:50:00.272 --> 01:50:04.935]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law, 9-11, Rise of the Police State.
[01:50:05.275 --> 01:50:09.699]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy.
[01:50:10.139 --> 01:50:14.342]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[01:50:14.542 --> 01:50:17.384]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[01:50:17.464 --> 01:50:19.966]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks...
[01:50:20.166 --> 01:50:20.706]  We're good to go.
[01:50:49.665 --> 01:50:58.008]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[01:50:58.348 --> 01:51:07.171]  It's portable and requires no water pressure, so you can enjoy healthy drinking water, whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[01:51:07.491 --> 01:51:12.172]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[01:51:12.632 --> 01:51:19.360]  The Berkey Lot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[01:51:19.761 --> 01:51:31.495]  It also removes foul-tasting odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:51:32.015 --> 01:51:36.480]  The Berkey Light's rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.
[01:51:36.641 --> 01:51:38.963]  Get the Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:51:38.983 --> 01:51:40.966]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:51:40.986 --> 01:51:42.187]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[01:51:42.247 --> 01:51:43.709]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[01:51:43.729 --> 01:51:44.770]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:51:55.563 --> 01:52:01.486]  Herbal Healer Academy is the global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.
[01:52:01.726 --> 01:52:03.967]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.
[01:52:04.168 --> 01:52:10.511]  We provide outstanding products like Esiac, colloidal silver 500 parts per million, olive leaf extract,
[01:52:10.711 --> 01:52:13.713]  Check out our online member testimonials and our hundreds of exceptional products.
[01:52:40.387 --> 01:52:43.468]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[01:52:43.628 --> 01:52:49.591]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[01:52:59.435 --> 01:53:01.096]  All right, this is what's going on with the border.
[01:53:01.896 --> 01:53:08.539]  For six years, Bush has been trying to get blanket total amnesty, and he's renamed it Guest Worker Program.
[01:53:09.372 --> 01:53:10.833]  And you can go read the legislation.
[01:53:11.374 --> 01:53:13.576]  Anyone who's here for the next six years is legal.
[01:53:13.616 --> 01:53:15.978]  Anyone who can get here in the next six years is legal.
[01:53:16.038 --> 01:53:21.662]  It allows corporations to fly in or bus in unlimited skilled and unskilled workers.
[01:53:21.682 --> 01:53:25.565]  I mean, you thought the special visas for skilled workers had decimated our jobs.
[01:53:25.605 --> 01:53:29.449]  Just wait for this from India and China and elsewhere.
[01:53:30.890 --> 01:53:34.253]  Then on top of it, they added little provisos in there to fool the public.
[01:53:34.273 --> 01:53:36.114]  And you'll hear the neocons pushing this on radio.
[01:53:36.134 --> 01:53:38.056]  Dick Cheney going on Limbaugh and others.
[01:53:38.675 --> 01:53:43.859]  There's a little proviso that if you're a felon that you don't get the citizenship, you don't get to stay here.
[01:53:44.280 --> 01:53:53.067]  But then they added a trap door in it or an escape route and it says, well, there's a hardship, you've got family here or a bunch of other issues, you get to stay.
[01:53:53.087 --> 01:53:56.289]  They're going to have the immigrants groups just like they did in 86.
[01:53:57.390 --> 01:53:57.771]  We're good to go.
[01:54:18.519 --> 01:54:24.563]  To stage all these demonstrations and to mobilize the illegal aliens as a fifth column that they can use to bully the American people.
[01:54:24.903 --> 01:54:27.025]  Notice they always give them positive coverage in the press.
[01:54:27.105 --> 01:54:31.728]  Any other demonstration gets negative coverage, whether it's anti-war or property rights.
[01:54:31.808 --> 01:54:33.690]  They want to discourage Americans demonstrating.
[01:54:33.930 --> 01:54:35.631]  They want to promote the illegals demonstrating.
[01:54:37.112 --> 01:54:38.093]  The media covers up.
[01:54:38.113 --> 01:54:40.694]  The marches are officially called the Day Without Gringos.
[01:54:40.714 --> 01:54:43.056]  They call it the Day Without Immigrants, but the AP got it right.
[01:54:43.076 --> 01:54:44.157]  It's the Day Without Gringos.
[01:54:44.921 --> 01:54:53.224]  They then have the very groups they control go demonstrate against this legislation that Bush is pushing to make it look like it must be good to fool conservatives.
[01:54:53.284 --> 01:54:54.965]  It's all good cop, bad cop.
[01:54:56.425 --> 01:54:58.066]  And that is what's happened.
[01:54:58.086 --> 01:55:04.408]  But by the time the average American reads the news, here's New York Times, Senate votes to extend fence along border.
[01:55:05.413 --> 01:55:10.003]  Boy, they're getting tough, and it says George Bush has gotten tough responding to his conservative base.
[01:55:10.544 --> 01:55:14.914]  Several hundred miles of fences to be built, and more Border Patrol, and 6,000 troops in the interim.
[01:55:15.655 --> 01:55:20.399]  But the troops, as we told you before we ever made the speech, are for security just to report to Border Patrol.
[01:55:20.660 --> 01:55:23.923]  There's so many illegal aliens, 50,000 Border Patrol couldn't arrest them all.
[01:55:24.203 --> 01:55:27.366]  They could arrest 1,000 illegals every day, 365 days a year.
[01:55:27.646 --> 01:55:33.932]  It'd be less than 1% of the 25 million that are here, with another 3 million coming into the country each year with only a million that go back home.
[01:55:33.972 --> 01:55:38.977]  That's a net increase of over 2 million a year, plus 900 and something thousand legal immigrants every year.
[01:55:39.317 --> 01:55:40.398]  So now we're up to 4 million.
[01:55:41.721 --> 01:55:48.584]  It goes on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on.
[01:55:51.185 --> 01:55:53.746]  And then you read in the article, it goes, some Republicans don't like it, though.
[01:55:53.786 --> 01:55:54.826]  They say it's not tough enough.
[01:55:57.667 --> 01:56:00.248]  Total smoke and mirrors, total lies.
[01:56:00.269 --> 01:56:02.709]  I mean, the very definition of it.
[01:56:04.250 --> 01:56:05.591]  And so that's what's really happening here.
[01:56:05.631 --> 01:56:10.192]  We'll go to break, start the next hour, go to a few calls, and we've got a guest coming up at Walton, Kansas City, and others.
[01:56:10.212 --> 01:56:11.313]  We're going to go to you first.
[01:56:12.443 --> 01:56:21.667]  Before we end this hour, I want to encourage you to get off the bench, to get in the game, to join us, and to come in for the big win against the New World Order.
[01:56:22.127 --> 01:56:22.847]  You've got a choice.
[01:56:22.927 --> 01:56:24.368]  Be a slave or stand up and fight.
[01:56:24.388 --> 01:56:26.068]  If you want freedom, you're going to have to fight.
[01:56:26.408 --> 01:56:29.229]  And that means hopefully in the Infowar, hopefully it won't get physical.
[01:56:30.890 --> 01:56:35.852]  We do have a right to defend ourselves and our families, though, and we will take up that right of need be, my friends.
[01:56:35.872 --> 01:56:36.832]  You've got to be ready for that as well.
[01:56:36.852 --> 01:56:38.273]  You've got to get your hearts right with God.
[01:56:39.611 --> 01:56:40.952]  Need to get my film, Martial Law.
[01:56:40.972 --> 01:56:41.813]  Need to get Road to Terror.
[01:56:41.833 --> 01:56:42.974]  Need to get Masters of Terror.
[01:56:43.014 --> 01:56:43.915]  Need to get Descent to Terror.
[01:56:43.935 --> 01:56:45.657]  Need to get Loose Change, second edition I carry.
[01:56:46.157 --> 01:56:47.318]  Get all the films I carry.
[01:56:47.338 --> 01:56:48.219]  Get the films I've made.
[01:56:48.259 --> 01:56:49.540]  Go to Infowars.com.

[01:56:57.948 --> 01:57:01.131]  If you already have my films and haven't made copies, make copies, please.

[01:57:25.333 --> 01:57:26.413]  Give them to people today.
[01:57:26.753 --> 01:57:30.375]  PrisonPlanet.tv Alright, third hour, 70 seconds away.

[01:57:38.511 --> 01:57:38.931]  Big Brother.
[01:57:39.071 --> 01:57:39.712]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:39.872 --> 01:57:43.275]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:45.677 --> 01:57:48.319]  You want answers?
[01:57:48.639 --> 01:57:50.501]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:58.343 --> 01:58:02.027]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.547 --> 01:58:06.651]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:10.254 --> 01:58:12.176]  Already into hour number three.
[01:58:12.196 --> 01:58:14.238]  I haven't even gotten into the plunge of the dollar.
[01:58:14.699 --> 01:58:17.081]  But Warren Buffett's doing a lot of other key information.
[01:58:17.561 --> 01:58:18.743]  It's coming up in this hour.
[01:58:18.963 --> 01:58:20.124]  New Iran developments.
[01:58:20.644 --> 01:58:23.147]  Iran's doing something despicable, if the report's true.
[01:58:24.435 --> 01:58:26.676]  It's in mainstream news, but that doesn't necessarily mean it.
[01:58:26.696 --> 01:58:30.717]  They're going to make Jews and Christians and Zoroastrians wear special tags.
[01:58:31.557 --> 01:58:32.477]  And no, I'm not kidding.
[01:58:34.838 --> 01:58:35.898]  Governments are evil, period.
[01:58:36.858 --> 01:58:38.219]  Let's go to the calls.
[01:58:38.259 --> 01:58:39.159]  I want to move quick here.
[01:58:39.179 --> 01:58:40.419]  Walt in Kansas City.
[01:58:40.459 --> 01:58:41.100]  Walt, welcome.
[01:58:41.720 --> 01:58:42.920]  Well, God bless you, Alex.
[01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:44.000]  I'll tell you what, man.
[01:58:44.600 --> 01:58:50.042]  I listen most of the day, all the time, and I even catch the broadcast again at night.
[01:58:50.754 --> 01:58:53.735]  You know, I've met some interesting people here lately.
[01:58:53.896 --> 01:59:00.799]  One gentleman yesterday from SEAL Team 3, I gave him your tips at Infowars.com to get a hold of you.
[01:59:00.819 --> 01:59:05.101]  He might be an interesting person to get on if he'll get with you.
[01:59:05.341 --> 01:59:07.782]  Now, I mean, I've met you, Walt, up in Kansas City.
[01:59:07.802 --> 01:59:13.445]  You're a great KCXL listener and our fine affiliate for six-plus years there in Kansas City.
[01:59:13.965 --> 01:59:15.666]  And it's good to have you calling.
[01:59:15.686 --> 01:59:16.967]  Walt, haven't heard from you in a while.
[01:59:17.327 --> 01:59:23.490]  Well, you know, I've been busy listening, and your colors are always so good, I don't really feel that I need to add anything, you know?
[01:59:23.830 --> 01:59:25.771]  What do you think about Bush's smoke and mirrors?
[01:59:25.852 --> 01:59:28.773]  Is it fooling conservatives you know with this border issue?
[01:59:29.453 --> 01:59:32.295]  I'll tell you what, the conservatives I knew aren't fooled.
[01:59:32.755 --> 01:59:41.240]  They're pretty much in my area, and I'll tell you what, several people I know have lost jobs, including myself.
[01:59:41.320 --> 01:59:45.722]  This is twice now in two years I've got fired, so I must be right over the target.
[01:59:46.704 --> 01:59:47.504]  You know what I mean?
[01:59:47.604 --> 01:59:49.225]  Oh, they fire you for speaking up?
[01:59:49.725 --> 01:59:50.225]  Oh, yeah.
[01:59:50.265 --> 01:59:54.426]  You know, in other words, handing out tapes and stuff like that.
[01:59:54.446 --> 01:59:56.526]  In fact, I was banned from General Motors for that.
[01:59:58.587 --> 02:00:02.448]  You know, you're not supposed to give out this... Really?
[02:00:02.488 --> 02:00:05.149]  An old Marine Vietnam pilot can't get a job?
[02:00:05.709 --> 02:00:06.169]  Oh, no.
[02:00:06.389 --> 02:00:06.589]  No.
[02:00:06.709 --> 02:00:12.630]  Plus, you know, I got injured on the job, and now they're using that to keep me from getting a job.
[02:00:12.690 --> 02:00:14.711]  The only way that I've been able to do any good...
[02:00:15.837 --> 02:00:19.699]  Is by going to these swap meets and hauling junk cars.
[02:00:20.299 --> 02:00:22.981]  I want to tell you, though, Alex, I want to give you some wonderful news.
[02:00:23.081 --> 02:00:27.843]  Back in April, we had a huge swap meet at the Shriner swap meet here in KC.
[02:00:28.463 --> 02:00:32.805]  I gave out over 70 of your videos, and usually it takes two days to get rid of them.
[02:00:34.086 --> 02:00:35.687]  All of them went that Saturday.
[02:00:37.628 --> 02:00:39.629]  Well, God bless you for doing the hard work.
[02:00:39.929 --> 02:00:55.173]  And Joshua, my son, my youngest boy, he's now 14, he's very instrumental because I'm often busy with folks, and when they ask him about them, oh, he tells them, he goes right into them, and he's seen them all.
[02:00:55.853 --> 02:01:04.976]  And I'll tell you what, one thing I want everybody to do, because I remember your interview with Walter Burian, everybody needs to get on their local people,
[02:01:05.561 --> 02:01:10.723]  About these comprehensive annual financial reports and save all of us some money.
[02:01:11.243 --> 02:01:16.985]  But they won't do it, but at least let them know that we know about your secret stash there, buddy.
[02:01:17.485 --> 02:01:18.005]  That's right.
[02:01:18.045 --> 02:01:19.266]  Plenty of money in the government.
[02:01:19.706 --> 02:01:21.506]  How's your other son doing in Iraq, Walt?
[02:01:21.947 --> 02:01:23.227]  Well, I don't know.
[02:01:23.247 --> 02:01:25.248]  I haven't heard from him, and I'm concerned.
[02:01:25.928 --> 02:01:28.269]  But that might be because he's too busy.
[02:01:28.289 --> 02:01:31.450]  And again, he's a B-2 mechanic at Whiteman.
[02:01:31.690 --> 02:01:34.751]  And again, this is his third round over there.
[02:01:35.723 --> 02:01:42.646]  And again, they sent his unit over to drive trucks because they're so sure to help.
[02:01:44.186 --> 02:01:46.767]  Isn't that great?
[02:01:47.047 --> 02:01:48.608]  That's a dangerous job.
[02:01:49.088 --> 02:01:50.149]  How long has he been there?
[02:01:50.909 --> 02:01:53.890]  Well, this is his third time back.
[02:01:54.410 --> 02:01:56.731]  The first time was actually before the war.
[02:01:56.791 --> 02:02:04.174]  Remember I called you and told you in December of 2000 they took all that stuff over and buried it in the caves in Kuwait?
[02:02:04.955 --> 02:02:08.799]  And then he went back to Iraq, and now he's back again.
[02:02:08.819 --> 02:02:21.432]  And I tell you, I am scared to death for his safety, and everybody out there who prays, please pray for my son George's safe return home to his beautiful wife Emily.
[02:02:22.333 --> 02:02:22.854]  Absolutely.
[02:02:22.874 --> 02:02:24.015]  Give us your son's full name.
[02:02:24.836 --> 02:02:26.358]  George S. Sipp.
[02:02:26.398 --> 02:02:27.539]  George Samuel Sipp.
[02:02:28.271 --> 02:02:28.692]  All right.
[02:02:28.712 --> 02:02:34.878]  He's Staff Sergeant with the 509th Support Wing at Whiteman.
[02:02:35.058 --> 02:02:35.358]  Sure.
[02:02:35.858 --> 02:02:36.839]  Don't be a stranger.
[02:02:36.879 --> 02:02:37.620]  Good hearing from you.
[02:02:37.880 --> 02:02:38.621]  God bless, Alex.
[02:02:38.741 --> 02:02:39.862]  Keep up your wonderful work.
[02:02:40.023 --> 02:02:40.543]  I'll try.
[02:02:41.084 --> 02:02:41.804]  We'll be right back.
[02:02:41.844 --> 02:02:42.325]  Stay with us.
[02:02:46.081 --> 02:02:47.562]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:02:47.742 --> 02:02:50.843]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[02:02:50.963 --> 02:02:54.885]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[02:02:54.925 --> 02:02:59.148]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2, The Takeover.
[02:02:59.488 --> 02:03:03.270]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[02:03:03.410 --> 02:03:05.251]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[02:03:05.391 --> 02:03:08.732]  Riot police attacked people on the streets indiscriminately.
[02:03:08.752 --> 02:03:09.853]  The medical bills...
[02:03:11.453 --> 02:03:13.474]  Are going to be enormous for me.
[02:03:13.614 --> 02:03:16.655]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[02:03:16.835 --> 02:03:19.736]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[02:03:20.196 --> 02:03:26.298]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[02:03:26.838 --> 02:03:27.359]  We're good to go.
[02:03:46.772 --> 02:03:51.295]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[02:03:51.636 --> 02:03:55.719]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[02:03:56.019 --> 02:03:56.579]  We listened.
[02:03:56.879 --> 02:04:01.863]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[02:04:02.143 --> 02:04:02.624]  We listened.
[02:04:03.004 --> 02:04:06.046]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[02:04:06.466 --> 02:04:06.987]  We listened.
[02:04:07.447 --> 02:04:11.509]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[02:04:11.889 --> 02:04:12.389]  We listened.
[02:04:12.730 --> 02:04:17.972]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[02:04:18.392 --> 02:04:19.753]  Again, we listened.
[02:04:20.113 --> 02:04:27.497]  Introducing the Berkey Light, the gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.
[02:04:27.877 --> 02:04:31.018]  Get the Berkey Light, the American water filter, for only $259 by
[02:04:37.363 --> 02:04:38.326]  That's toll-free 888-803-4438.
[02:04:38.346 --> 02:04:39.791]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:04:45.333 --> 02:04:46.934]  I used to be ashamed of my toenails.
[02:04:47.194 --> 02:04:51.557]  I thought I was destined to wear tennis shoes through the heat of the summer and hide my toes at the beach.
[02:04:51.857 --> 02:04:54.559]  Then my podiatrist told me about Non-X Nail Gel.
[02:04:54.859 --> 02:04:59.983]  It tackles unsightly nails by clearing out the cause of the problem, yellowing carrots and debris buildup.
[02:05:00.223 --> 02:05:04.666]  With regular use, Non-X Gel breaks down and removes this debris so toenails look clear.
[02:05:04.926 --> 02:05:10.010]  This summer I'm wearing open-toed sandals again, thanks to a topical natural gel called Non-X.
[02:05:10.250 --> 02:05:13.072]  If your toenails are embarrassing, I recommend Non-X Nail Gel.
[02:05:13.212 --> 02:05:14.993]  It's at your pharmacy or mass retailer.
[02:05:15.333 --> 02:05:16.814]  We're good to go.
[02:05:45.882 --> 02:05:53.607]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show, because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:05:56.309 --> 02:06:03.053]  We've got Professor William K. Black on with us, Associate Professor of Economics and Law at UMKC.
[02:06:03.713 --> 02:06:06.715]  He's the Executive Director of the Institute for Fraud Prevention.
[02:06:07.175 --> 02:06:13.539]  He's taught previously at the LBJ School of Public Affairs, the University of Texas at LBJ, and at Santa Clara University.
[02:06:13.559 --> 02:06:14.220]  We're going to go back
[02:06:15.007 --> 02:06:17.209]  To our guests and then to all of your calls.
[02:06:17.329 --> 02:06:18.830]  Go to our guests here in just a few minutes.
[02:06:20.452 --> 02:06:27.398]  Before we do that, we're having a big 9-11 Truth Conference, American Scholar Symposium 9-11 and the Neocon Agenda.
[02:06:27.458 --> 02:06:36.305]  Professor Stephen Jones of BYU, physics professor, will be exposing the controlled demolition of the thermite bombs in Tower 1 and 2 and the controlled demolition of 7.
[02:06:37.246 --> 02:06:40.809]  We have the founder of the 9-11 Scholars for Truth, Professor Jim Fetzer, will be there.
[02:06:42.225 --> 02:06:49.411]  We are also, of course, going to have the former head of the Star Wars program, Dr. Bob Bowman, exposing 9-11 as an inside job.
[02:06:49.431 --> 02:06:56.076]  We're going to have William Rodriguez, the hero of 9-11, who helped the firefighters get a lot of people out, who was there when the building collapsed.
[02:06:56.436 --> 02:06:58.538]  He'll be there talking about the bombs going off in the building.
[02:06:58.818 --> 02:07:01.520]  We have a surprise guest, several surprise guests.
[02:07:01.580 --> 02:07:02.921]  I'm sure you can imagine who they are.
[02:07:03.342 --> 02:07:04.703]  They're going to be there as well.
[02:07:06.417 --> 02:07:07.558]  Don't wait, don't delay.
[02:07:07.638 --> 02:07:09.819]  Get your tickets now at InfoWars.com.
[02:07:09.840 --> 02:07:12.802]  You link through to the AmericanScholarSymposium.org.

[02:07:15.123 --> 02:07:18.065]  They drop down from $70-something to $34 apiece.
[02:07:18.085 --> 02:07:20.027]  We want to encourage a lot of people to come.

[02:07:23.229 --> 02:07:26.191]  I'll premiere my new film, Terror Storm, at the start of the conference.
[02:07:27.361 --> 02:07:30.543]  And we're going to show Loose Change 2 with some little added tidbits he's been working on.
[02:07:30.583 --> 02:07:31.984]  Just, again, another surprise.
[02:07:32.705 --> 02:07:33.766]  Dylan Avery will be there.
[02:07:34.366 --> 02:07:37.969]  This is going to be a once-in-a-lifetime event, June 24th and 25th.
[02:07:38.509 --> 02:07:40.110]  And that's in downtown Los Angeles.
[02:07:40.130 --> 02:07:41.951]  Details at Infowars.com.
[02:07:42.252 --> 02:07:47.595]  But if you're not online and you want to call and get your tickets mailed to you, the toll-free number is 1-888-253-3139.
[02:07:47.615 --> 02:07:47.655]  888-253-3139.
[02:07:58.228 --> 02:08:03.871]  We're having it right in the middle of holiday time when folks go on vacation.
[02:08:03.931 --> 02:08:05.712]  So go visit Southern California.
[02:08:05.732 --> 02:08:06.413]  A lot of sites.
[02:08:06.893 --> 02:08:08.013]  Come to our event for two days.
[02:08:08.033 --> 02:08:09.634]  Spend a few more days seeing the sites.
[02:08:10.295 --> 02:08:11.355]  And have a great time.
[02:08:11.415 --> 02:08:12.856]  And it's going to be very informative.
[02:08:12.876 --> 02:08:14.737]  We want you to be participants in this.
[02:08:14.757 --> 02:08:18.779]  We'll also have question and answers three times a day for long periods of time.
[02:08:18.859 --> 02:08:19.680]  Panel discussions.
[02:08:20.140 --> 02:08:21.221]  We're good to go.
[02:08:21.241 --> 02:08:21.921]  We're good to go.
[02:08:46.061 --> 02:08:52.210]  We've had folks on Confessions of an Economic Hitman, working for the big banks to go in and blow out countries by design.
[02:08:52.230 --> 02:08:53.492]  We've interviewed Greg Palast.
[02:08:54.528 --> 02:08:56.349]  He got the IMF World Bank documents in 2002.
[02:08:56.389 --> 02:09:11.078]  The IMF and World Bank confirmed these are their documents, where they openly try to hurt economies, blow out economies, engineer depressions, to then steal the infrastructures of countries, to then jack up prices, on average three times that.
[02:09:11.599 --> 02:09:16.382]  And to give us another angle of this is the author of The Best Way to Rob a Bank is to Own One.
[02:09:17.042 --> 02:09:18.603]  And I first saw Professor Black
[02:09:19.605 --> 02:09:28.010]  Quoted in an article out of Mother Jones Magazine, the predator state, Enron, Tyco, WorldCom, and the U.S.
[02:09:28.130 --> 02:09:28.570]  government.
[02:09:28.630 --> 02:09:30.871]  He's got some interesting quotes in here.
[02:09:32.052 --> 02:09:34.513]  And we are now joined by Professor Black.
[02:09:34.533 --> 02:09:35.354]  Thanks for coming on, sir.
[02:09:35.374 --> 02:09:36.134]  Thank you.
[02:09:36.992 --> 02:09:37.533]  All right.
[02:09:55.386 --> 02:09:56.467]  I'm a Midwesterner.
[02:09:58.547 --> 02:10:14.211]  On my third career, started out as a typical big firm lawyer, went into the government in the heart of the savings and loan crisis, dealing with trying to get the crooks under control and the powerful politicians supporting them.
[02:10:15.175 --> 02:10:30.449]  And then went back to school and got a doctorate in criminology, and I specialize in what happens when the CEO or the head of state is the crook and uses the corporation or the nation as a weapon to fraud others.
[02:10:30.649 --> 02:10:32.610]  Professor, isn't that the definition of tyranny?
[02:10:32.650 --> 02:10:35.612]  It's just when crooks take over and start literally feeding.
[02:10:35.672 --> 02:10:38.614]  And now Bush is announcing that he is a dictator.
[02:10:38.694 --> 02:10:41.696]  He's announcing dictator powers are being above the law.
[02:10:41.716 --> 02:10:46.179]  Can we get out of the gates since you've got a criminology degree and a law degree and study this specifically?
[02:10:46.199 --> 02:10:49.261]  I mean, what would you call Bush?
[02:10:49.321 --> 02:10:52.163]  Or would you say my statement's too strong or not strong enough?
[02:10:53.672 --> 02:10:58.714]  Well, I don't know that he's a tyrant because of that particular thing.
[02:10:58.754 --> 02:11:09.898]  I agree that he has engineered the greatest cutback in civil liberties and constitutional rights of any president in a very long time.
[02:11:10.798 --> 02:11:15.480]  And I seriously think he's the worst president in our history.
[02:11:16.500 --> 02:11:26.303]  But, I mean, he's openly having his lawyers, John Hughes said we can torture children in front of their parents, and then when he was asked for the CFR meeting about it, we played the recording, he said yes.
[02:11:27.063 --> 02:11:29.163]  The Attorney General says Bush is above the law.
[02:11:29.543 --> 02:11:40.606]  I mean, when a president starts saying that he can ignore the Congress, remember how they weren't going to reauthorize the Patriot Act and expand it, so Bush said, even if you don't reauthorize, I'm still going to enforce?
[02:11:40.886 --> 02:11:42.667]  That is a dictator's statement.
[02:11:43.166 --> 02:11:46.908]  Well, and there's something worse as well, or at least it goes with it.
[02:11:47.528 --> 02:11:51.629]  He's defined war as being any time there's terrorism.
[02:11:51.789 --> 02:11:55.351]  Well, there's terrorism at all times in history.
[02:11:55.711 --> 02:11:58.072]  So this is a war that will be in perpetuity.
[02:11:58.152 --> 02:12:05.895]  So if you say, I'm going to have special powers, but they're only going to exist during wartime, but then you define wartime as all time,
[02:12:07.749 --> 02:12:09.690]  And then you have a farce.
[02:12:09.710 --> 02:12:11.470]  So it's eternal war.
[02:12:11.971 --> 02:12:13.411]  It's an eight on its side.
[02:12:13.471 --> 02:12:14.111]  It's infinity.
[02:12:14.611 --> 02:12:14.772]  Yeah.
[02:12:16.112 --> 02:12:16.752]  Absolutely right.
[02:12:17.292 --> 02:12:25.095]  So you have a degree in criminology on top of your law degree, and you study specifically CEOs and governments.
[02:12:25.755 --> 02:12:35.218]  Break down some of the crimes that you've witnessed and where you think we're going, because it seems like there's a wild, orgy-like, sinking Titanic looting going on, Professor.
[02:12:36.204 --> 02:12:41.766]  Yes, and it's in part because we didn't learn about the right lessons.
[02:12:41.866 --> 02:12:45.987]  In fact, we learned exactly the wrong lessons from the earlier waves of fraud.
[02:12:46.047 --> 02:13:01.672]  So I got started with this thing down with Texas Savings and Loans, particularly Vernon Savings and Loan, which to the regulators was known as Vermin, a place where 96% of its loans were in default when it closed.
[02:13:02.350 --> 02:13:20.735]  And the key thing about that was that then-Speaker Wright went to bat and was willing to hold up the financing for the entire nation designed to close down these kind of fraudulent SNLs to help this particular sleazy SNL.
[02:13:21.035 --> 02:13:22.756]  And of course the Bushes... Charles Keating.
[02:13:23.136 --> 02:13:24.196]  Exactly, Charles Keating.
[02:13:24.216 --> 02:13:26.157]  The Bushes are always knee-deep in all of this.
[02:13:27.156 --> 02:13:37.781]  Well, obviously Neil Bush, the brother of the current president, was involved in Silverado in Colorado.
[02:13:37.801 --> 02:13:48.025]  And then when our agency sought to take, frankly, what was a very mild enforcement action against him, his mother...
[02:13:49.533 --> 02:14:00.538]  went to a White House person who then called over to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's General Counsel and tried to get him to pull the case.
[02:14:00.778 --> 02:14:02.939]  Mommy, I got caught stealing!
[02:14:03.319 --> 02:14:04.079]  Mommy!
[02:14:04.099 --> 02:14:15.864]  So, yes, these are folks who use their power and then use their power to avoid paying the consequences to causing enormous damage.
[02:14:16.539 --> 02:14:19.822]  Well, I've looked at the SNLs, and of course you worked in it and helped prosecute a lot of it.
[02:14:19.882 --> 02:14:23.205]  But, sir, at the same time, I mean, Bush Sr.
[02:14:23.366 --> 02:14:25.548]  has been on the board of banks that have been doing this, too.
[02:14:25.588 --> 02:14:26.569]  It's not just Neal.
[02:14:27.369 --> 02:14:29.832]  No, Bush Sr.
[02:14:29.932 --> 02:14:35.397]  was the one in charge of financial deregulation in the Reagan-Bush administration.
[02:14:35.437 --> 02:14:37.479]  Well, there's BCCI and Clark Clifford.
[02:14:37.499 --> 02:14:38.240]  I mean, it goes further.
[02:14:38.460 --> 02:14:39.461]  But, I mean, you're an expert on this.
[02:14:39.501 --> 02:14:39.961]  I'll shut up.
[02:14:39.981 --> 02:14:40.662]  Just tell us about it.
[02:14:41.883 --> 02:14:50.286]  Well, I mean, what you get in these situations is when the CEO is the crook, you can do massively greater damage.
[02:14:50.966 --> 02:14:55.708]  You can optimize the firm, the corporation first, as a vehicle for fraud.
[02:14:56.188 --> 02:14:56.908]  So what do you do?
[02:14:57.268 --> 02:15:04.751]  You put your assets overwhelmingly into things that have no clear market value.
[02:15:04.971 --> 02:15:07.172]  And that allows you to use accounting scams
[02:15:07.975 --> 02:15:22.162]  So that a place like Vernon, that in fact was virtually completely bankrupt in the sense that it had virtually no real assets, it reported it was the most profitable SNL in America.
[02:15:22.502 --> 02:15:28.825]  And it got the most elite of accounting firms to bless that with clean opinions.
[02:15:29.673 --> 02:15:35.596]  And then to make it worse, the way that you really optimize it is you grow very rapidly.
[02:15:35.616 --> 02:15:36.996]  You become a Ponzi scheme.
[02:15:37.056 --> 02:15:39.277]  And, of course, you're seeing this in many areas now.
[02:15:40.358 --> 02:15:56.925]  But what it meant for Texas, of course, was an enormous bubble because you had all of the fraudulent S&Ls, even as vacancy rates surged, continuing to add more and more see-through office buildings, if you remember that era.
[02:15:57.914 --> 02:16:05.379]  I remember, I lived in Rockwall, and we would drive across the lake in Danny Faulkner's developments, and they were falling apart.
[02:16:05.459 --> 02:16:06.440]  And I'm not kidding, folks.
[02:16:06.760 --> 02:16:09.742]  They were blowing down and falling apart before they finished them.
[02:16:10.562 --> 02:16:11.763]  That's absolutely right.
[02:16:11.803 --> 02:16:17.727]  We called them moon pads, Martian moon pads, because often the only thing that was left was the concrete pad.
[02:16:19.096 --> 02:16:21.277]  And that was, you know, a typical example.
[02:16:21.337 --> 02:16:29.542]  The guy that they brought in as a face person had been the head of the Trade Association of Savings and Loans.
[02:16:30.162 --> 02:16:38.967]  So what happens next in all of this is, of course, eventually the regulators and the prosecutors might start to get suspicious.
[02:16:39.688 --> 02:16:46.552]  And at that point, you use the fact that you have the apparent legitimacy of a corporation, you know, we think of them as honest,
[02:16:47.868 --> 02:16:52.629]  And, of course, the resource is even more important, and they make political contributions.
[02:16:53.189 --> 02:16:54.009]  And what does it matter?
[02:16:54.089 --> 02:16:59.210]  Because the contributions are made by the corporation that the CEO is looting.
[02:16:59.270 --> 02:17:02.270]  It's already insolvent, so money is no object.
[02:17:02.771 --> 02:17:09.992]  And they're able to get enormous, successful interventions in public policy.
[02:17:10.012 --> 02:17:12.632]  And that's the predatory state aspect.
[02:17:12.872 --> 02:17:13.332]  Exactly.
[02:17:13.352 --> 02:17:16.873]  You have the government backing up crime, and then before they brought the Ponzi scheme out,
[02:17:17.558 --> 02:17:22.459]  They conduit most of the real assets into other real corporations that they control.
[02:17:23.359 --> 02:17:26.980]  Yes, and of course a bunch of others that they don't necessarily control.
[02:17:27.080 --> 02:17:35.221]  So construction trades do very well if there's a bubble, and contractors do very well, and they aren't necessarily fraudulent.
[02:17:35.241 --> 02:17:40.202]  But you're right, some of the money is also taken and moved to other countries.
[02:17:40.242 --> 02:17:41.082]  Professor, stay there.
[02:17:41.122 --> 02:17:44.183]  I want to come back and talk about the bubble today we face.
[02:17:47.492 --> 02:17:48.332]  Come on, Bill.
[02:17:48.552 --> 02:17:53.713]  Two weeks ago you were riding the bicycle, and today you're showing up in your new car and telling me you're buying a house.
[02:17:54.053 --> 02:17:55.534]  What did you do, rob Bill Gates?
[02:17:55.634 --> 02:17:57.614]  No, John, I didn't rob Bill Gates.
[02:17:57.894 --> 02:18:03.395]  What I did do is visit the website www.didyourobbillgates.com.
[02:18:03.695 --> 02:18:09.956]  That's where I learned how to make $3,000 to $9,000 each and every week, starting with my very first week.
[02:18:10.297 --> 02:18:12.477]  It's a simple program that does all the work for you.
[02:18:12.777 --> 02:18:16.178]  I'm already up to $25,000 just going on my third week.
[02:18:16.438 --> 02:18:16.858]  Whoa.
[02:18:17.238 --> 02:18:18.459]  What was that website again?
[02:18:18.519 --> 02:18:22.000]  It's www.didyourobbillgates.com.
[02:18:22.320 --> 02:18:23.440]  Now write this down, John.
[02:18:23.561 --> 02:18:27.862]  You should go there and learn how this program can help you become financially independent, too.
[02:18:28.022 --> 02:18:28.602]  Thanks, Bill.
[02:18:28.882 --> 02:18:30.063]  I'm going there right now.
[02:18:30.483 --> 02:18:31.123]  Check, please.
[02:18:32.906 --> 02:18:34.367]  Uh, you got this one, right, Bill?
[02:18:34.847 --> 02:18:35.427]  Sure, John.
[02:18:35.667 --> 02:18:40.029]  Don't forget, it's www.DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[02:18:40.329 --> 02:18:42.050]  Next time, you'll be buying me lunch.
[02:18:42.190 --> 02:18:42.550]  Deal.
[02:18:42.570 --> 02:18:46.132]  Hi, folks.
[02:18:46.192 --> 02:18:47.912]  Jack Browning from Midas Resources.
[02:18:48.253 --> 02:18:49.253]  The real money, folks.
[02:18:52.554 --> 02:18:54.455]  Let's review a few things from the past year.
[02:18:54.975 --> 02:18:55.836]  November 2003 to November 2004.
[02:18:55.876 --> 02:18:56.516]  The Dow was ranged from 9,800 to 10,300.

[02:21:18.803 --> 02:21:19.223]  We're good to go.
[02:21:53.115 --> 02:21:55.257]  Professor William Black is our guest.
[02:21:55.277 --> 02:21:57.959]  We'll talk about some of the books he's authored before he leaves us.
[02:21:58.359 --> 02:22:00.201]  We'll also take some calls coming up in the next segment.
[02:22:00.221 --> 02:22:02.523]  I'm sure whatever issue it is, he can comment on it.
[02:22:04.444 --> 02:22:11.690]  I have the Brookshire Hathaway, some of the minutes, I have some of the transcripts of what was said last weekend at their big meeting.
[02:22:12.251 --> 02:22:17.375]  And they're giggling and laughing and talking about the giant bubble and how America's going to implode and how they'll buy everything up cheap.
[02:22:17.395 --> 02:22:19.857]  Because they also make money after they blow it out, folks.
[02:22:20.437 --> 02:22:22.519]  And the dollars plunge 40 plus percent.
[02:22:23.731 --> 02:22:29.752]  The new Fed Chairman Bernanke is saying he's going to double the money supply in the next two years.
[02:22:30.052 --> 02:22:34.273]  In the last six, the former outgoing Fed Chief Greenspan doubled it.
[02:22:35.654 --> 02:22:36.434]  And they love it.
[02:22:36.474 --> 02:22:39.394]  I mean, they're taking what they did in Texas to the national level.
[02:22:40.235 --> 02:22:41.875]  You've studied crime in government, sir.
[02:22:41.915 --> 02:22:49.217]  It looks like all of the other Ponzi schemes of the past have been just expanded to gargantuan proportions.
[02:22:49.637 --> 02:22:51.097]  Would you like to comment on that statement?
[02:22:51.875 --> 02:23:03.599]  Yeah, the conventional economic wisdom, after all this fraud in the savings and loans, where over a thousand savings and loans senior insiders were convicted of felonies, was there was no fraud.
[02:23:04.579 --> 02:23:20.924]  It was all just a distraction, and the markets worked perfectly, you don't need anyone looking for fraud, and of course it produced the latest stuff, the Enrons and the WorldCom, the largest wave of prosecuted frauds in the history of the world.
[02:23:21.440 --> 02:23:27.682]  And, of course, you saw in Russia with the privatization disaster and all of the corruption and such.
[02:23:27.962 --> 02:23:29.663]  The six oligarchs.
[02:23:30.023 --> 02:23:32.424]  Yes, just endemic fraud.
[02:23:32.544 --> 02:23:34.044]  Everywhere you look, fraud.
[02:23:34.384 --> 02:23:44.428]  And it not only discredited completely the market-type answers, but it helped bring an increasingly dictatorial Putin to power.
[02:23:45.848 --> 02:23:48.409]  Can you imagine if what was...
[02:23:49.042 --> 02:23:53.824]  What has happened in Latin America had happened with a Democrat as a president.
[02:23:54.185 --> 02:23:56.766]  Everyone would be talking about who lost Latin America.
[02:23:56.786 --> 02:24:09.432]  You know, one virulently anti-American leader after another being elected there, in large part because the privatization plans, you talked about the IMF and World Bank.
[02:24:09.512 --> 02:24:11.954]  Well, they proved absolutely disastrous.
[02:24:12.034 --> 02:24:14.915]  They assumed that they would all be run honestly.
[02:24:14.975 --> 02:24:16.556]  Instead, of course, you sell everything.
[02:24:17.543 --> 02:24:20.864]  You know, if you're going to privatize the phone company, you sell it to your crony.
[02:24:21.384 --> 02:24:24.105]  And you sell it for half of its real market value.
[02:24:24.645 --> 02:24:25.865]  And then they triple prices.
[02:24:26.465 --> 02:24:26.685]  Right.
[02:24:27.045 --> 02:24:32.627]  And then they have recessions, and then everyone gets upset at market economies and such.
[02:24:32.887 --> 02:24:35.728]  And, of course, eventually they say, throw these bums out.
[02:24:35.948 --> 02:24:38.368]  But the IMF calls it the IMF riot.
[02:24:38.688 --> 02:24:45.090]  They say they actually want to break down, as you just mentioned with Putin, to then bring in a police state to organize even more grabbing.
[02:24:46.570 --> 02:24:56.253]  Well, you know, the IMF and World Bank, World Bank's moved away from this somewhat, believed in what was known as the Washington Consensus.
[02:24:56.693 --> 02:25:05.636]  And it was very arrogant, and it was a one-size-fits-all, and it was, you know, the old joke in economics, assume the can opener, they assumed honesty.
[02:25:06.249 --> 02:25:11.991]  Well, okay, but if you do, I will fleece you.
[02:25:12.531 --> 02:25:15.492]  And that's exactly what happened.
[02:25:15.892 --> 02:25:18.453]  But it's not by accident, Professor.
[02:25:18.493 --> 02:25:20.733]  I mean, it's the fleecers that set the rules.
[02:25:21.914 --> 02:25:24.114]  It is, but it isn't entirely.
[02:25:24.434 --> 02:25:28.175]  I mean, these guys aren't so smart that it's all by plan either.
[02:25:28.235 --> 02:25:30.076]  They really are arrogantly stupid.
[02:25:31.003 --> 02:25:36.390]  They really don't much get troubled by the facts that prove them wrong.
[02:25:36.751 --> 02:25:40.435]  They just keep repeating the same nonsense time after time.
[02:25:41.772 --> 02:25:44.454]  You know, it may be that they're all on drugs, but I don't think so.
[02:25:44.474 --> 02:25:53.860]  They do appear to believe it, many of the folks that you see, and it's just, you know, reality doesn't seem to be able to intrude upon them.
[02:25:54.040 --> 02:25:56.822]  So, Professor Black, what do you see happening in America now?
[02:25:56.882 --> 02:26:01.725]  I mean, with the real estate bubble and the overprinting of currency and all these other indicators?
[02:26:02.125 --> 02:26:09.610]  Well, you know, you've brought up, and actually one of your ads, your commercials brought up your sponsors,
[02:26:10.479 --> 02:26:13.881]  There has been an enormous rise in the price of gold.
[02:26:14.161 --> 02:26:19.684]  Six years ago, people were talking about gold as the stupidest investment you could possibly imagine.
[02:26:20.224 --> 02:26:21.225]  It doesn't pay interest.
[02:26:21.505 --> 02:26:23.766]  You've got to pay money to have it.
[02:26:24.506 --> 02:26:29.669]  And nations were dumping gold out of their reserves, saying, why are we holding gold?
[02:26:29.709 --> 02:26:30.389]  This is stupid.
[02:26:31.150 --> 02:26:37.813]  And now you have an incredible rise in the price of gold, an incredible fall in the dollar.
[02:26:37.853 --> 02:26:39.234]  Well, duh, what does it tell you?
[02:26:39.847 --> 02:26:40.207]  I think so.
[02:26:58.760 --> 02:27:00.882]  Drops precipitously and gold goes up.
[02:27:01.062 --> 02:27:01.902]  You're right, Professor.
[02:27:01.962 --> 02:27:03.143]  It's not just the overprinting.
[02:27:03.183 --> 02:27:05.325]  If people had confidence, it would still continue.
[02:27:05.725 --> 02:27:09.328]  But we know we're being scammed so bad that we've seen the man behind the curtain.
[02:27:09.728 --> 02:27:10.128]  That's right.
[02:27:10.148 --> 02:27:13.711]  You can fool, you know, the old thing about you can't fool all the people all the time.
[02:27:14.411 --> 02:27:16.873]  And the markets are saying, we don't believe you.
[02:27:18.462 --> 02:27:19.602]  Or there's the way Bush says it.
[02:27:19.622 --> 02:27:20.943]  There's an old saying in Texas.
[02:27:20.983 --> 02:27:22.123]  Maybe it was in Tennessee.
[02:27:22.583 --> 02:27:24.223]  Fool me once, shame on you.
[02:27:24.783 --> 02:27:26.624]  Shame, shame, shame.
[02:27:26.704 --> 02:27:27.624]  Won't get fooled again.
[02:27:27.904 --> 02:27:28.744]  Fool, fool.
[02:27:29.244 --> 02:27:32.885]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, with the professor.
[02:27:36.606 --> 02:27:37.506]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.986 --> 02:27:39.606]  The empire's on the run.

[02:27:46.807 --> 02:27:49.248]  David J. Smith for News Watch Magazine.
[02:27:50.029 --> 02:27:55.652]  Over the last 40 years, we've seen prayer and God thrown out of the schools by decisions of the U.S.
[02:27:55.692 --> 02:27:56.453]  Supreme Court.
[02:27:57.213 --> 02:28:01.515]  Yet on February 29, 1892, in an eyeing nothing decision of the U.S.
[02:28:01.555 --> 02:28:05.177]  Supreme Court, America was declared a Christian nation.
[02:28:06.158 --> 02:28:11.361]  There is an ongoing assault on your First Amendment right of freedom of religion and freedom of assembly.

[02:30:51.289 --> 02:30:53.210]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:30:53.690 --> 02:30:56.511]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:31:04.255 --> 02:31:10.697]  Leslie, Jim, Osa, Rhonda, Nat, and many others, your calls are coming up here in just a few minutes.
[02:31:11.658 --> 02:31:16.580]  The author of The Best Way to Rob a Bank is to own one, William K. Black, professor.
[02:31:17.972 --> 02:31:24.778]  Got a law degree, also a professor in criminology, been following this for decades, been investigating it, been part of the groups going after these people.
[02:31:25.659 --> 02:31:45.216]  Sir, before we go to these calls, watching this over all these years, watching this develop, and you talk about the confidence in the government and the regulators being out the window, where people still steal tens of billions of dollars and they get a few months in prison, and other people mysteriously die, so no one's really being punished.
[02:31:46.973 --> 02:31:47.874]  What's your time frame?
[02:31:47.954 --> 02:31:49.295]  What do you predict?
[02:31:50.496 --> 02:31:51.496]  What do you surmise?
[02:31:51.517 --> 02:31:56.501]  What do you estimate is going to happen in the next few months, the next few years here in the United States?
[02:31:58.222 --> 02:32:05.028]  Well, I think that there is a severe housing bubble and that it's already breaking in a number of regional markets.
[02:32:05.708 --> 02:32:13.995]  You can see that inflation has reached serious levels where the Fed is worried that it's made mistakes.
[02:32:16.050 --> 02:32:34.594]  As long as China and India keep up major growth, and if Japan starts coming out of its 15-year series of recessions, you won't necessarily get terrible recession.
[02:32:35.854 --> 02:32:41.195]  But if you continue the way you're doing, you'll ruin the institutions.
[02:32:41.215 --> 02:32:45.656]  You know, your line, as you went out to break, about fool me once...
[02:32:46.570 --> 02:32:50.431]  That's exactly rational, but it's exactly the danger as well.
[02:32:51.092 --> 02:33:04.436]  Because everything economics and now a whole bunch of other things is teaching us is trust is critically important to a well-functioning economy, to a well-functioning government, society, marriage, everything else.
[02:33:05.157 --> 02:33:09.078]  And once you get cheated, it's rational not to trust.
[02:33:10.399 --> 02:33:12.659]  But when you do, things break down.
[02:33:13.280 --> 02:33:14.160]  And so it's
[02:33:15.004 --> 02:33:18.707]  If you think about what fraud is, its defining element is deceit.
[02:33:19.227 --> 02:33:24.550]  So what you do is first create trust and then betray it.
[02:33:25.391 --> 02:33:31.895]  And because of that, fraud is about the most effective solvent you can think of for destroying trust.
[02:33:32.456 --> 02:33:41.822]  And that's what we're seeing, fraud in the highest levels, not just in government, but our most prestigious economic institutions, the Citicorp's,
[02:33:42.896 --> 02:33:46.480]  Well, Professor, let me add something to that.
[02:33:47.381 --> 02:33:51.246]  The media is complicit in this, and owned by the very corporations that are taking part in this.
[02:33:51.586 --> 02:33:56.492]  Whenever they run a scam, they'll blame a few scapegoats or a few sacrificial lambs.
[02:33:56.512 --> 02:33:58.995]  They'll burn one or two patsies or one or two crooks.
[02:33:59.651 --> 02:34:06.256]  But then really protect those, so this just goes on, and then fool the public into thinking that things have been fixed and repaired.
[02:34:06.636 --> 02:34:09.198]  The problem is you can only cry wolf so many times.
[02:34:09.778 --> 02:34:13.220]  Yeah, in criminology we call it the vice president in charge of going to jail.
[02:34:13.881 --> 02:34:14.201]  Ha ha!
[02:34:17.623 --> 02:34:20.966]  But, I mean, the fraud is so massive this time, Professor.
[02:34:22.126 --> 02:34:28.651]  Yes, and, you know, there's this wonderful memorandum by KPMG saying,
[02:34:29.473 --> 02:34:46.092]  One of the remaining big four audit firms in which they say, we're going to violate the law on these tax shelters, and the reason we're going to do it is every single one of our competitors violates the law, and there are competitive advantages if you violate the law.
[02:34:46.513 --> 02:34:48.455]  So if we were honest, we'd go out of business.
[02:34:49.938 --> 02:34:51.100]  That's how bad it's gotten.
[02:34:51.180 --> 02:35:06.080]  Well, that's what happens in a corrupt society is that everyone just becomes corrupt but then that destroys trust so you become a place like Russia where you can't get up on your hind legs because the only defense is doing what the Russian slaves would do is just lay down and do nothing.
[02:35:06.824 --> 02:35:21.895]  And beyond that, Putin just gave a speech two weeks ago decrying the fact that the country's population is plummeting, and the reason it's plummeting is that the life expectancy is gone down by over a decade.
[02:35:24.236 --> 02:35:28.099]  Everything is collapsed in a number of sectors.
[02:35:28.119 --> 02:35:29.120]  Look at Argentina.
[02:35:29.840 --> 02:35:30.060]  In the
[02:35:31.474 --> 02:35:35.039]  One time in France... They were almost first world in Argentina.
[02:35:35.199 --> 02:35:36.681]  Oh, they weren't almost, Alex.
[02:35:36.721 --> 02:35:42.309]  They were one of the top ten nations in 1900 in GDP per capita.
[02:35:42.950 --> 02:35:46.134]  The French used to have a saying, rich as an Argentine.
[02:35:46.618 --> 02:35:47.119]  That's right.
[02:35:47.139 --> 02:35:49.341]  They went to third world status.
[02:35:49.401 --> 02:35:55.208]  Now they're back up probably to second world status economically in the last couple of years.
[02:35:55.248 --> 02:35:59.313]  But they went down and suddenly you couldn't drink the water safely.
[02:35:59.754 --> 02:36:01.636]  You couldn't drive on the road safely.
[02:36:01.696 --> 02:36:04.540]  By the way, I remember the Washington Post article with photos.
[02:36:05.550 --> 02:36:07.891]  Yeah, that's, you know, we think of ourselves as being immune from that.
[02:36:35.342 --> 02:36:40.804]  But you can have economic collapse far quicker than you can have economic progress.
[02:36:43.265 --> 02:36:44.685]  Well, look at what happened in Katrina.
[02:36:46.766 --> 02:36:47.646]  That's an obscenity.
[02:36:47.666 --> 02:36:57.670]  You know, A, government failed, but B, you have people in charge who define government as the enemy and the problem.
[02:36:58.482 --> 02:37:02.108]  Well, how are you going to get people in who are going to be competent?
[02:37:02.328 --> 02:37:08.879]  Well, listen, they wanted it to be a worse situation so they could have more no-bid contracts with their buddies.
[02:37:08.919 --> 02:37:09.680]  I mean, take Halliburton.
[02:37:09.700 --> 02:37:10.722]  This has been the Houston Chronicle.
[02:37:11.255 --> 02:37:19.757]  Hal Burton brings in tens of thousands of illegal aliens to do the rebuilding, and then they even cheat them and don't even pay them and just say, no, we're not going to pay you.
[02:37:20.817 --> 02:37:27.538]  Bush gives a speech there in downtown New Orleans with a generator putting the lights on behind him saying, look, the power's on.
[02:37:27.578 --> 02:37:29.259]  He lies and says that.
[02:37:29.639 --> 02:37:30.919]  Just everything's a hoax.
[02:37:30.979 --> 02:37:31.939]  Everything's a lie.
[02:37:32.299 --> 02:37:38.061]  He says we're going to give all the contracts to locals, and then last time I checked there were almost no local contracts.
[02:37:38.481 --> 02:37:40.261]  I mean, you look at that, it's a big scam.
[02:37:40.621 --> 02:37:44.163]  Well, as Colbert says, nobody does photo ops better than our country.
[02:37:45.023 --> 02:37:49.586]  We may not be able to produce steel, but by God, we can produce creative directors.
[02:37:51.176 --> 02:38:00.759]  One of the major things about using aliens who don't have green cards is that you have far more leverage over them.
[02:38:01.199 --> 02:38:06.501]  And so you see nationwide that there's a lot of cheating of some very hard-working folks.
[02:38:07.641 --> 02:38:13.823]  And so if you like immigrants, having illegal immigration is not a good thing for immigrants.
[02:38:13.903 --> 02:38:14.684]  Here's an example.
[02:38:14.744 --> 02:38:18.685]  I tell Walmart employees, and I was one about 14 years ago and it happened to me,
[02:38:19.497 --> 02:38:25.920]  But they've been sued and they've been convicted and it's been in the news that they order you to work about 10 hours extra a week.
[02:38:25.960 --> 02:38:27.400]  They don't pay overtime.
[02:38:27.560 --> 02:38:29.701]  They go, go clock in and work three more hours.
[02:38:30.121 --> 02:38:34.423]  I want you to physically unload that tractor trailer of batteries.
[02:38:34.963 --> 02:38:36.924]  We don't have a machine to get them off the pallets.
[02:38:36.944 --> 02:38:40.746]  You're going to physically climb up one by one and you're all burned with battery acid.
[02:38:40.766 --> 02:38:46.528]  The point is that, oh, if Americans won't do this, we'll just bring illegal aliens in.
[02:38:47.288 --> 02:38:49.149]  And to further your point...
[02:38:49.802 --> 02:38:55.147]  On the Halliburtons of the world, we actually have pockets of really good people still.
[02:38:55.828 --> 02:39:04.255]  And one of the pockets we had was an Inspector General's outfit that did auditing of fraud in the contractors in Iraq.
[02:39:04.376 --> 02:39:08.199]  You know, this just made the news earlier this week.
[02:39:08.259 --> 02:39:09.120]  You may have followed it.
[02:39:09.400 --> 02:39:10.181]  So what did they do?
[02:39:10.481 --> 02:39:13.304]  They passed a bill to redefine...
[02:39:13.979 --> 02:39:21.380]  The title of these funds for Iraq so that they'll no longer be subject to audit by that office.
[02:39:22.241 --> 02:39:22.881]  I saw that.
[02:39:23.221 --> 02:39:24.341]  Let me bring up one more point.
[02:39:24.361 --> 02:39:25.641]  I should bring up Iraq.
[02:39:26.041 --> 02:39:38.784]  The first action of the provisional government under Bremer in Iraq two months in, when they fired that first general, Paul Bremer said no more national numbers on homicides, cancers, deaths.
[02:39:39.584 --> 02:39:41.404]  So they did that to cover up the slaughter of
[02:39:42.262 --> 02:39:44.223]  And then you bring up the other point.
[02:39:44.243 --> 02:39:46.143]  Please continue, Professor.
[02:39:46.704 --> 02:39:50.865]  Yeah, well, I mean, all this farce about, you know, could a civil war begin?
[02:39:50.885 --> 02:39:55.227]  The civil war has been going on for well over a year in Iraq.
[02:39:55.607 --> 02:40:02.309]  Now, I tell you, I just trained some folks, including the head of their ministry that does anti-corruption.
[02:40:03.035 --> 02:40:05.637]  They have some very good and some very brave people.
[02:40:06.117 --> 02:40:18.326]  For example, two of the members of their office just discovered over a billion dollars of diversion of oil was simply stolen and taken to Syria, where it doubtless is funding terrorism, right?
[02:40:19.066 --> 02:40:23.389]  And two of their investigators were murdered just as they were coming here.
[02:40:23.449 --> 02:40:28.433]  So you get honest people trying in lots of places, and they're targeted, right?
[02:40:29.335 --> 02:40:31.957]  And the killers have so much money, they just hire hitmen.
[02:40:31.997 --> 02:40:32.838]  Let me bring something else.
[02:40:32.938 --> 02:40:36.321]  You sound like a well-read person, a widely-read professor.
[02:40:36.341 --> 02:40:40.264]  You're obviously well-read, but on other subjects, you're widely-read as well.
[02:40:40.324 --> 02:40:44.507]  Did you see the Chicago Tribune with John Yoo and others?
[02:40:44.587 --> 02:40:51.793]  There was another Chicago Tribune article where they admitted that there are two full-time lobbyists on Capitol Hill for DynCorp and Halliburton.
[02:40:52.674 --> 02:41:08.826]  Blocking the army implementing the already existing laws against white slavery and kidnapping in Serbia and Iraq, and that indeed they are engaging in white slavery, and Halliburton and DynCorp have full-time lobbyists lobbying openly in the floor of the House and Senate against this.
[02:41:09.787 --> 02:41:17.452]  The trafficking stuff on so many levels, you could do whole shows on this.
[02:41:17.533 --> 02:41:19.234]  But I mean, Professor, what I'm saying is...
[02:41:22.572 --> 02:41:23.553]  Israel is dirty.
[02:41:23.993 --> 02:41:27.415]  You look almost everywhere in the world, and it's a scandal.
[02:41:28.276 --> 02:41:32.939]  But that's my point, is that I feel like, I keep saying Twilight Zone, Twilight Zone, until it has no effect.
[02:41:33.219 --> 02:41:36.601]  Outer Limits, Crazy Land, Alice in Wonderland, whatever.
[02:41:36.981 --> 02:41:39.163]  I mean, I'm reading Chicago Tribune.
[02:41:40.037 --> 02:41:44.080]  Where they admit that a lot of these women and girls they're grabbing are for sex slaves.
[02:41:44.501 --> 02:41:45.842]  It's in the paper.
[02:41:46.402 --> 02:41:50.645]  They list the names of the lobbyists, and no one gets arrested.
[02:41:50.706 --> 02:41:54.348]  I mean, are they going to start having lobbyists for serial killers on Capitol Hill?
[02:41:54.408 --> 02:41:56.250]  Or maybe lobbyists for cannibals?
[02:41:56.290 --> 02:42:02.395]  I mean, will rich people start having, you know, golfing outings where they have a roast, where they roast a child at the end?
[02:42:02.435 --> 02:42:03.756]  And they have a lobbyist that...
[02:42:04.236 --> 02:42:17.766]  As you know, I teach economics in addition to these other things, and there are lots of screw-ups in economics, but ultimately, there are a lot of important truths, and the number of lobbyists has more than doubled in six years.
[02:42:18.006 --> 02:42:18.947]  What does that tell you?
[02:42:20.788 --> 02:42:24.270]  That there's a free-for-all of large S being greedily fed on.
[02:42:24.591 --> 02:42:26.312]  And that it works, right?
[02:42:26.572 --> 02:42:29.194]  They don't spend all that money unless it works.
[02:42:30.174 --> 02:42:32.656]  And, you know, the K Street strategy is...
[02:42:34.833 --> 02:42:41.779]  ...an immoral obscenity that was profoundly anti-democratic.
[02:42:42.059 --> 02:42:44.261]  It wasn't simply that they were looting.
[02:42:44.941 --> 02:42:57.692]  To say you can only hire lobbyists of one party, you can only contribute to our party, or we will cut you dead, and you will get no ability...
[02:42:58.772 --> 02:43:00.693]  To even talk to us in Congress.
[02:43:00.753 --> 02:43:01.833]  Professor, one last question.
[02:43:01.853 --> 02:43:02.634]  We're going to take some calls.
[02:43:02.654 --> 02:43:03.314]  We're honored to have you.
[02:43:03.334 --> 02:43:05.335]  Plug any websites or books you'd like to at the end.
[02:43:06.475 --> 02:43:07.575]  I'm trying to understand this.
[02:43:08.236 --> 02:43:09.816]  You know, a lot of other countries have been smart.
[02:43:09.876 --> 02:43:14.818]  Even if they're authoritarian, they don't allow a lot of corruption because they want there to be a middle class.
[02:43:14.858 --> 02:43:16.159]  They want there to be funding.
[02:43:16.179 --> 02:43:17.479]  They want there to be tax wealth.
[02:43:18.040 --> 02:43:19.600]  They know corruption is destructive.
[02:43:21.121 --> 02:43:22.681]  But we see other countries that get corrupt.
[02:43:22.721 --> 02:43:26.663]  They always turn into third world cesspools or dictatorships or worse.
[02:43:27.486 --> 02:43:27.807]  Um, it's...
[02:43:45.055 --> 02:44:01.411]  Extraordinarily bad, but it's been extraordinarily bad at other times in American history as well, when basically there was a very well-known market price for a senator, and where every corporation had major judges on their payroll directly.
[02:44:03.312 --> 02:44:04.754]  So I guess I'm
[02:44:05.951 --> 02:44:08.673]  More optimistic, perhaps.
[02:44:08.833 --> 02:44:15.598]  But the criminals, Professor, it's like in The Godfather, which is based on a true story, as you know, where Don Corleone says, I'm not going to sell drugs.
[02:44:16.358 --> 02:44:25.344]  He says, judges we control, but they're not going to get involved in drugs, they're not going to get involved in the really dirty stuff.
[02:44:25.424 --> 02:44:27.746]  Something changed, even in the criminals now.
[02:44:28.686 --> 02:44:30.187]  Where they're just even worse than ever.
[02:44:30.207 --> 02:44:30.787]  That's my point.
[02:44:31.047 --> 02:44:34.449]  Granting that, but that's always the dangerous message.
[02:44:34.489 --> 02:44:37.790]  They told us it was impossible to take on the SNL crooks.
[02:44:38.250 --> 02:44:44.493]  We ended up getting more than a thousand felony convictions of people who are immensely powerful politically.
[02:44:44.513 --> 02:44:49.955]  I mean, Jim Wright, the Speaker of the House, made enormous efforts to try to get me fired.
[02:44:50.955 --> 02:44:51.456]  And failed.
[02:44:51.796 --> 02:44:54.057]  And he ends up having to resign in disgrace.
[02:44:54.437 --> 02:44:54.877]  It's still...
[02:44:55.640 --> 02:44:56.841]  An amazing country.
[02:44:56.981 --> 02:44:57.281]  No, no, no.
[02:44:57.441 --> 02:45:00.503]  I agree, Professor, that we can beat them.
[02:45:01.043 --> 02:45:05.065]  But it's kind of like we're in a plane that's going to crash.
[02:45:05.085 --> 02:45:10.909]  We need to get the flaps up and slow down and have somewhat of a controlled landing, and we'll get off this thing alive.
[02:45:11.569 --> 02:45:15.371]  I'm just saying that it's mind-blowing.
[02:45:15.671 --> 02:45:18.853]  I mean, I'm almost speechless, the amount of corruption that's just admitted.
[02:45:19.794 --> 02:45:23.856]  Yeah, but again, they sort of want you to give up.
[02:45:25.163 --> 02:45:26.564]  And believe that it's helpless.
[02:45:26.864 --> 02:45:32.466]  And instead, you know, as the old saying goes, you're not required to finish the tasks of life.
[02:45:34.087 --> 02:45:37.628]  The requirement as a human being is that you do what you can.
[02:45:37.848 --> 02:45:38.529]  No, I agree.
[02:45:38.629 --> 02:45:42.951]  In fact, there's a founding father quote about, duty is ours, consequence belongs to God.
[02:45:42.971 --> 02:45:43.831]  Right.
[02:45:44.011 --> 02:45:46.392]  And so we've got to do the... No, no, I agree with you.
[02:45:46.432 --> 02:45:49.133]  Let's take a call from Leslie in Virginia for the professor.
[02:45:49.173 --> 02:45:50.074]  You're on the air, Leslie.
[02:45:50.094 --> 02:45:50.434]  Go ahead.
[02:45:50.979 --> 02:45:57.822]  Yes, I think to rectify this situation in which the public has not demanded, Professor, is disclosure.
[02:45:57.942 --> 02:46:06.886]  And as you know, it is because of the lack of disclosure that criminal activity is allowed to advance at a further stage.
[02:46:07.467 --> 02:46:08.647]  As you know, Professor, in 1986,
[02:46:10.566 --> 02:46:29.031]  The Limited Partnership Act was changed, whereas the limited partners were no longer required by law to publicly disclose their amounts and contributions to whatever asset or partnership they were in, except of the general partner.
[02:46:29.631 --> 02:46:35.272]  And as you know, it was normally 1%, and this was publicly disclosed in the courthouse.
[02:46:36.073 --> 02:46:36.973]  And as you know,
[02:46:37.682 --> 02:46:46.105]  The Congress, you look at Congress, state legislature, any of them, you will see you can take a Mack truck to that public disclosure.
[02:46:46.566 --> 02:46:53.848]  We need to get back where our laws were in 1982 to rectify this criminal activity because you do not have an audit trail.
[02:46:54.189 --> 02:47:04.653]  And as you know, Professor, there were very few convictions in that 500 million, excuse me, billion... Okay, thank you for the call.
[02:47:04.713 --> 02:47:05.113]  I think that's...
[02:47:05.780 --> 02:47:07.781]  I think that's a lot of points you made there, Professor.
[02:47:08.181 --> 02:47:08.881]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:47:08.921 --> 02:47:13.462]  Transparency is critical, and look what has happened in Congress.
[02:47:13.983 --> 02:47:21.245]  The House and Senate Ethics Committees, until yesterday, have been absolutely shut down for virtually two years.
[02:47:22.025 --> 02:47:27.587]  Oversight hearings have fallen to historical lows in modern times.
[02:47:28.940 --> 02:47:46.330]  So people aren't looking, and when people don't look, and when you have an administration that makes an absolute obsession out of keeping, well, making our secrets their non-secret, and keeping their secrets secret, then you're going to have corruption flourish.
[02:47:46.870 --> 02:47:53.514]  And so the Bible says, you know, all those that doeth evil hateth the light.
[02:47:54.872 --> 02:47:55.353]  Yes, and they are...
[02:48:09.341 --> 02:48:11.021]  And they lie, I mean, to be blunt.
[02:48:11.682 --> 02:48:21.684]  And worse, in some ways, they deliberately craft phrases that make it sound one thing and mean another to them, if you know their specialized meaning.
[02:48:21.704 --> 02:48:23.044]  Well, that's like General Hayden.
[02:48:23.184 --> 02:48:34.687]  Yesterday, he said he acted like he was proud of the fact that he deliberately used a disingenuous phrase about communications to deceive everyone.
[02:48:35.007 --> 02:48:36.208]  And that showed what?
[02:48:36.408 --> 02:48:37.968]  That he was a good English scholar?
[02:48:38.806 --> 02:48:40.587]  I know, he's a sickening creature.
[02:48:40.647 --> 02:48:42.188]  Final segment, take a few final calls.
[02:48:42.588 --> 02:48:45.569]  On the other side, stay with us.
[02:48:47.350 --> 02:48:50.191]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[02:48:50.452 --> 02:48:52.032]  Hello, my friends, Alex Jones here.
[02:48:52.372 --> 02:48:57.035]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law, 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[02:48:57.395 --> 02:49:04.118]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[02:49:04.438 --> 02:49:06.420]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[02:49:06.620 --> 02:49:09.462]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[02:49:09.563 --> 02:49:14.227]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[02:49:14.447 --> 02:49:18.811]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[02:49:19.091 --> 02:49:26.317]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[02:49:26.557 --> 02:49:28.979]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.

[02:51:49.440 --> 02:51:50.481]  Final segment.
[02:51:50.501 --> 02:51:52.483]  I tell you, it's simple.
[02:51:52.503 --> 02:51:58.929]  We've got organized criminals banding together to loot the daylights out of us and telling us it's for homeland security.
[02:51:59.597 --> 02:52:01.238]  Professor William Black is our guest.
[02:52:01.258 --> 02:52:03.980]  We'll take a few calls here and try to get in as many as we can.
[02:52:04.020 --> 02:52:07.843]  Professor Black, any key websites or books or things you'd like to promote?
[02:52:09.024 --> 02:52:14.207]  Well, we've got a new book coming out on the current wave of scandals.
[02:52:14.287 --> 02:52:16.709]  It's a working title is Financial Superpredators.
[02:52:16.729 --> 02:52:21.852]  It's with Henry Pontell and Steve Rossoff.
[02:52:22.173 --> 02:52:25.855]  I'm working out of the Markkula Center for Applied Ethics at Santa Clara.
[02:52:25.895 --> 02:52:26.916]  The website there has
[02:52:27.361 --> 02:52:31.842]  Many things that might be of interest to your listeners, including some by me.
[02:52:32.522 --> 02:52:35.163]  And we have links to all of that up on InfoWars.com.
[02:52:35.183 --> 02:52:38.544]  People can also find the book, The Best Way to Rob a Bank is to Own One.
[02:52:38.944 --> 02:52:41.325]  Osa in Texas, you're on the air with Professor Black.
[02:52:41.345 --> 02:52:43.745]  I have a question.
[02:52:43.785 --> 02:52:44.646]  I want to ask this.
[02:52:45.366 --> 02:52:52.988]  Did the professor, do you see any type of imminent crash due to the implosion of our dollar and the way our economy is run?
[02:52:54.164 --> 02:52:59.488]  Basically, by the way, the banks, or banksters I like to call them, are taking money and uprooting it from our economy.
[02:52:59.808 --> 02:53:00.969]  Do you see an intimate crash?
[02:53:01.009 --> 02:53:02.210]  If so, how soon?
[02:53:02.610 --> 02:53:05.772]  Yeah, they're taking the assets out of the country at a feverish rate.
[02:53:06.933 --> 02:53:09.055]  No, I don't see an imminent collapse.
[02:53:09.475 --> 02:53:15.700]  I do believe that, as I said, that the housing bubble is quite real, quite severe, and that it's...
[02:53:17.336 --> 02:53:18.998]  In the process of bursting.
[02:53:19.178 --> 02:53:22.280]  What's collapsing are our families and savings.
[02:53:22.320 --> 02:53:26.784]  We have the record low savings, negative savings, the highest it's ever been in U.S.
[02:53:26.824 --> 02:53:27.144]  history.
[02:53:28.426 --> 02:53:35.371]  Yes, and we've got a bunch of policies that are perversely designed to encourage that to get worse.
[02:53:36.933 --> 02:53:37.753]  Thank you, Osa.
[02:53:37.793 --> 02:53:39.315]  Let's talk to Jim in Wisconsin.
[02:53:39.355 --> 02:53:40.135]  Jim, you're on the air.
[02:53:40.196 --> 02:53:40.576]  Go ahead.
[02:53:41.320 --> 02:53:49.685]  Yeah, I just had a few points about, kind of touches on this, but also what you were talking about earlier, the future scenarios and evolution of this fascism.
[02:53:49.705 --> 02:53:51.467]  Yeah, I meant to get into that.
[02:53:51.527 --> 02:53:52.207]  I'll do that tomorrow.
[02:53:52.247 --> 02:53:53.208]  Go ahead.
[02:53:53.268 --> 02:54:00.252]  Well, it's good to be aware of what's coming down the pike, and you're in the business of waking people up, and that's why you talk about it, and that's good.
[02:54:00.673 --> 02:54:09.038]  But if we don't put a great deal of energy into focusing on alternatives to all that, then we will be living in the worst hell we can imagine.
[02:54:10.123 --> 02:54:12.685]  Healthy soil and water are worth more than gold.
[02:54:14.086 --> 02:54:17.589]  If we unplug from the power grid, that would certainly help us out a lot.
[02:54:18.110 --> 02:54:25.196]  There's a great book on this called Currents of Death that goes into how damaging the 60 hertz currents are to us.
[02:54:26.334 --> 02:54:30.598]  Hey, send it to us, and call me back tomorrow, because that's important, and that's another area.
[02:54:30.658 --> 02:54:32.579]  I mean, corruption just isn't this financial stuff.
[02:54:32.879 --> 02:54:46.169]  We have Monsanto and others openly at board meetings, this has been in mainstream news, saying we want to infect all the genetic systems in the plants, but then claim we own it and force you to eat this, and the Nobel Prize winners in genetics say it's deadly poison.
[02:54:46.509 --> 02:54:50.292]  I mean, that's another example, Professor, of just a wild corruption and no regulation.
[02:54:51.300 --> 02:55:01.931]  Well, you've seen a really severe drop in the quality of places like the CDC, that's communicable disease, and the FDA.
[02:55:02.291 --> 02:55:14.684]  You've seen the public health network crushed at the time when if they really do get these plagues, whether man-made or natural, the burden is going to fall on the public health system, and it's going to be just like Petrina.
[02:55:15.658 --> 02:55:16.538]  It will fall apart.
[02:55:16.758 --> 02:55:23.880]  Well, all of the public health money is spent on buying $4 billion of vaccine from Rumsfeld's firm when the vaccine, they say, won't even help.
[02:55:23.900 --> 02:55:25.300]  I mean, it's all scams.
[02:55:26.441 --> 02:55:31.442]  It's a travesty, and it's a travesty in almost every place you look.
[02:55:31.482 --> 02:55:34.943]  That's why I actually am deadly serious.
[02:55:35.243 --> 02:55:38.703]  I do think he's the worst president we've ever had to suffer through.
[02:55:39.864 --> 02:55:42.464]  Well, Professor, I really want to thank you for joining us.
[02:55:42.544 --> 02:55:45.005]  And as soon as your new book, Super Predators, correct?
[02:55:45.709 --> 02:55:47.710]  Financial Super Predators is the working title.
[02:55:47.890 --> 02:55:54.293]  As soon as that comes out, I'd like to have you back on and plug it, and I'd like to perhaps even carry it in our online video and bookstore at infowars.com.
[02:55:54.593 --> 02:55:55.453]  Godspeed, my friend.
[02:55:55.473 --> 02:55:56.114]  Keep up the good work.
[02:55:56.314 --> 02:55:56.654]  Take care.
[02:55:57.214 --> 02:55:57.534]  You bet.
[02:55:58.034 --> 02:55:59.935]  Sorry to Rhonda, sorry to Nat, sorry to others.
[02:56:00.396 --> 02:56:04.477]  I'll be back tonight, 9 to midnight, back on Monday, 11 to 2 Central Standard Time.
[02:56:04.497 --> 02:56:09.640]  Be sure and join us, and be sure and get your tickets now for our big 9-11 conference coming up June 24th and 25th.
[02:56:10.899 --> 02:56:12.180]  It's going to be really exciting.

[02:56:16.043 --> 02:56:17.645]  A lot of big guests and surprise guests.
