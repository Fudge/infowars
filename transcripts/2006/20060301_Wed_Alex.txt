[00:00:05.657 --> 00:00:06.318]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.979 --> 00:00:08.021]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.742 --> 00:00:09.844]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.525 --> 00:00:11.266]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.063 --> 00:00:12.943]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.963 --> 00:00:17.484]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.804 --> 00:00:21.925]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:27.847 --> 00:00:34.408]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, coming up in the third hour today on this March 1st, 2006 broadcast.
[00:00:34.488 --> 00:00:38.349]  We've got Paul Joseph Watson for his biweekly report joining us.
[00:00:39.292 --> 00:00:44.494]  In the meantime, I want to get into the concentration camps in great detail, because a lot more is beginning to emerge.
[00:00:44.514 --> 00:00:45.275]  It's not rumor.
[00:00:45.715 --> 00:00:47.216]  It's documented in your face.
[00:00:47.296 --> 00:00:53.558]  It's happening in this country right now, the same type of police state they have in Iraq, they want to have here domestically in this country.
[00:00:53.598 --> 00:00:59.281]  The criminals are in control of the government at almost every level, and they are subdividing and looting the entire economy.
[00:00:59.321 --> 00:01:01.182]  It is very, very serious.
[00:01:01.841 --> 00:01:04.342]  We're going to deal with it in this first hour today.
[00:01:04.362 --> 00:01:14.384]  We're also going to have a little bit of fun with some musicians who put together an interesting little hip-hop video that are scheduled to join us for a couple segments here in studio later.
[00:01:15.264 --> 00:01:18.945]  Now, this is a report out of New American Media.
[00:01:19.005 --> 00:01:19.745]  Ten-year U.S.
[00:01:19.885 --> 00:01:24.826]  strategic plan for detention camps, revised proposals from Oliver North.
[00:01:24.946 --> 00:01:26.167]  We had made this point.
[00:01:26.207 --> 00:01:27.647]  I'm glad now it's being picked up.
[00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:33.422]  And they have links in this article to all of the admitted declassified plans.
[00:01:34.142 --> 00:01:42.386]  And the Homeland Security plan for these camps all over the country, quote, for the Enemy and Sedition Act, Alien and Sedition Act, is End Game.
[00:01:42.426 --> 00:01:43.227]  That's the code name.
[00:01:43.427 --> 00:01:44.007]  End Game.
[00:01:44.027 --> 00:01:45.548]  Yes, that's the End Game.
[00:01:46.008 --> 00:01:57.974]  The End Game is to take your pension funds and put you in camps and take your guns and totally enslave you after the military-industrial complex stages a major atomic attack or biological attack in this country.
[00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.704]  And just as sure as the sun came up this morning, it's gonna happen.
[00:02:01.724 --> 00:02:02.525]  You're gonna wake up.
[00:02:02.585 --> 00:02:03.326]  It's gonna happen.
[00:02:03.767 --> 00:02:06.590]  Unless everybody begins to wake up to who's behind the terror.
[00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:13.600]  If the globalists know that we know that they're doing it, and if the police wake up to it, and if the military wakes up to it, the globalists will back off.
[00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:32.510]  They'll still take the roads and the water districts and privatize everything and repossess the country, but they won't take your guns and all of your private homes and put you in camps and have a national draft and ship your sons off as imperial slaves in the imperial war and the imperial assault on these 60 plus countries they openly say they're going to be targeting.
[00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.351]  So it's real simple.
[00:02:36.091 --> 00:02:37.232]  It's all coming into view.
[00:02:37.332 --> 00:02:38.333]  It's right in front of us.
[00:02:38.433 --> 00:02:38.953]  It's happening.
[00:02:40.006 --> 00:02:57.712]  And I've been screaming about this for over a decade because I simply came into contact with the documents, the Urban Warfare Training, I witnessed it, I've interviewed many experts from inside the government, and we've known about the plan and they've been very slowly but methodically laying the groundwork for this control grid and its happening right now.
[00:02:59.025 --> 00:03:01.326]  article that Paul Watson and I wrote yesterday.
[00:03:01.386 --> 00:03:05.888]  Gulags for American Citizens in Final Planning Stages, came out last night.
[00:03:06.148 --> 00:03:10.410]  Halliburton Sex Slave Trade Criminals Prepare Camps for Political Dissidence.
[00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:14.112]  And I want to read this article in its entirety and also this other story here.
[00:03:14.412 --> 00:03:14.952]  Ten-Year U.S.
[00:03:15.052 --> 00:03:18.814]  Strategic Plan for Detention Camps Revised Proposals from Oliver North.
[00:03:18.854 --> 00:03:24.496]  And we're actually posting today for free up on InfoWars.com in between about five other duties.
[00:03:24.556 --> 00:03:26.057]  Ryan Slickheisen is doing it right now.
[00:03:27.429 --> 00:03:31.570]  In between customer service, people call up and say, how do I get my browser to launch?
[00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:34.311]  We're just so overworked here.
[00:03:35.231 --> 00:03:53.595]  But he's going to be uploading from America, Destroyed by Design, my first film, some video clips from the congressional hearings where they admitted these camps, and the late Henry B. Gonzalez talks about it as well, not just Congressman Jack Brooks, and then Congressman Inouye, who's still on the committee, still the chairman.
[00:03:54.315 --> 00:03:57.358]  20-something years later shuts the whole thing down.
[00:03:57.378 --> 00:03:58.739]  I guess exactly 20 years later.
[00:03:58.779 --> 00:04:00.480]  This was in 1986.
[00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:03.583]  So that's coming up after the break.
[00:04:03.623 --> 00:04:04.343]  Please take notes.
[00:04:04.383 --> 00:04:05.184]  Please record this.
[00:04:05.224 --> 00:04:11.629]  Please tell your friends and family to tune in right now because this is very, very serious and this is the facts.
[00:04:12.109 --> 00:04:14.771]  You want to hear about Operation End Game?
[00:04:14.871 --> 00:04:15.692]  That's what it's called.
[00:04:16.613 --> 00:04:17.834]  Operation End Game.
[00:04:20.151 --> 00:04:21.932]  Operation End Game.
[00:04:21.972 --> 00:04:24.614]  The end game for destroying America.
[00:04:25.094 --> 00:04:26.655]  Butchering the Bill of Rights.
[00:04:27.336 --> 00:04:31.939]  And all these boys from the CIA had to do was carry out a couple terror attacks.
[00:04:32.399 --> 00:04:34.800]  Just like they did to overthrow all those third world countries.
[00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:35.861]  They've done it here!
[00:04:36.982 --> 00:04:40.524]  And boy, they just can't wait to get you in a full bore police state.
[00:04:40.564 --> 00:04:41.745]  They got a lot of fun.
[00:04:42.512 --> 00:04:44.875]  Planned for you and your family.
[00:04:45.235 --> 00:04:52.804]  We can be buffaloed and cowed by this and go along with it or we can stand up like Americans in our great tradition and cling the clocks of these criminal scumbags.
[00:04:52.844 --> 00:04:57.949]  These organized crime syndicates think they can run roughshod over this nation in buffaloes.
[00:04:58.430 --> 00:04:59.411]  They got another thing coming.
[00:05:01.405 --> 00:05:04.887]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[00:05:05.148 --> 00:05:08.670]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:12.693]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[00:05:12.913 --> 00:05:19.077]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:05:19.477 --> 00:05:27.403]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[00:05:27.803 --> 00:05:33.148]  Black Berkey Filter Elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[00:05:33.308 --> 00:05:37.072]  Get the Black Berkey Filter Elements, leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:05:37.452 --> 00:05:39.294]  And the Black Berkey Filters are reclaimable.

[00:06:01.203 --> 00:06:04.109]  What really happened September 11th and who stands to gain?
[00:06:04.793 --> 00:06:06.093]  Alex Jones here, America.
[00:06:06.293 --> 00:06:12.015]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest and most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[00:06:12.315 --> 00:06:17.556]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[00:06:17.856 --> 00:06:21.997]  Brace yourselves as the new world order program for world domination is blown wide open.
[00:06:22.177 --> 00:06:25.958]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world, where the military and the police are merged.
[00:06:26.218 --> 00:06:30.839]  Witnesses populations beg for national ID cards, and yes, even implantable microchips.
[00:06:30.939 --> 00:06:33.660]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies.
[00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:37.183]  Psychotic UN Population Control Plans and much, much more.
[00:06:37.243 --> 00:06:39.125]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.
[00:06:39.545 --> 00:06:41.647]  Order 9-1-1 The Road to Terry today.

[00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:59.382]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.
[00:07:01.064 --> 00:07:07.408]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[00:07:07.629 --> 00:07:12.632]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using the Rife Frequency Technology.
[00:07:12.972 --> 00:07:20.878]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:07:21.038 --> 00:07:28.083]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:07:28.283 --> 00:07:29.504]  There are no side effects.
[00:07:29.644 --> 00:07:33.046]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.

[00:07:48.574 --> 00:07:49.514]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[00:08:05.934 --> 00:08:06.574]  Big Brother.
[00:08:07.234 --> 00:08:08.295]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:09.015 --> 00:08:10.115]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:10.775 --> 00:08:11.575]  You want answers?
[00:08:12.356 --> 00:08:13.196]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:13.896 --> 00:08:17.537]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:18.097 --> 00:08:22.158]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:32.822 --> 00:08:39.146]  Alright, I'm going to get into concentration camps, FEMA camps, emergency centers for your safety.
[00:08:40.207 --> 00:08:46.091]  It's all coming up in the shower on this March 1st, 2006 edition.
[00:08:46.151 --> 00:08:55.136]  But first off is an article out of the New York Sun yesterday that a caller mentioned at the very end of the broadcast, and I do have it here in my hot little hands.
[00:08:55.557 --> 00:09:00.300]  Patriot Act email searches apply to non-terrorist, judges say.
[00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:01.981]  And a lot of people are freaked out by this article.
[00:09:02.601 --> 00:09:09.484]  I have three-year-old articles where, you know, in North Carolina they're using it charging people who are selling marijuana.
[00:09:09.524 --> 00:09:10.984]  I mean, there's so many.
[00:09:12.044 --> 00:09:21.648]  We've listed them, the topless bars and the homeless people, and, oh, you don't get due process, you don't get a Fourth Amendment, oh, we're going to use this at the local level.
[00:09:21.688 --> 00:09:24.669]  And it's happening in every county and every city across the nation.
[00:09:25.229 --> 00:09:30.116]  But you turn on the national news and they'll say, give me one example of where it's been used.
[00:09:30.156 --> 00:09:34.522]  And then they have these little staged events where the supposed opposition goes, I can't, I'm dumb!
[00:09:34.542 --> 00:09:37.286]  And they go, see, you're a fool, you're a liar.
[00:09:37.547 --> 00:09:38.929]  It's all staged, it's just theater.
[00:09:40.299 --> 00:09:50.546]  Two federal judges in Florida have upheld the authority of individual courts to use the Patriot Act to order searches anywhere in the country for emails and computer data in all types of criminal investigations.
[00:09:51.006 --> 00:09:58.711]  You hear that in all types of criminal investigations, because all crime is terror under Section 802.
[00:09:58.771 --> 00:10:05.195]  Don't worry, you'll get your rights unless you're a terrorist, but all crime is terror, and then they've made basically everything illegal, so...
[00:10:06.136 --> 00:10:11.221]  Overruling a magistrate who found that Congress limited such jurisdiction to cases involving terrorism.
[00:10:11.602 --> 00:10:13.343]  But again, the lawyers wrote this.
[00:10:13.464 --> 00:10:15.606]  Everything is terrorism, including all misdemeanors.
[00:10:16.206 --> 00:10:28.739]  The disagreement among the jurists about the scope of the powers simmered for more than two years before coming to light in an opinion unsealed earlier this month, as if the press couldn't discover they were using it against garden-variety supposed crimes.
[00:10:29.309 --> 00:10:41.777]  The resolution, which underscored the government's broad legal authority to intercept electronic communications, comes as a debate is raging over President Bush's warrantless surveillance program and the duties of internet providers to protect personal data.
[00:10:42.885 --> 00:10:43.685]  And it goes on.
[00:10:43.725 --> 00:10:56.671]  Magistrate Glasbrook said in passing the Patriot Act, formerly known as Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act, Congress made it clear its focus was terrorism.
[00:10:56.731 --> 00:11:06.896]  He said that there was nothing in the language Congress adopted in the days after September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks that suggested the nationwide search provision could apply to garden variety federal cases.
[00:11:07.356 --> 00:11:09.737]  Well, I'm sorry, Magistrate Glazebrook.
[00:11:10.097 --> 00:11:12.959]  Though you're trying to defend this country, you're wrong.
[00:11:14.239 --> 00:11:23.403]  And the Feds have gone out with the FBI, Homeland Security, BATF, and many others all over the country and visited toy stores selling knockoff Rubik's Cubes.
[00:11:24.744 --> 00:11:28.826]  They have gotten involved with county commissioners in bid payoffs.
[00:11:29.546 --> 00:11:30.947]  Everything you can imagine.
[00:11:31.127 --> 00:11:32.487]  Hundreds and hundreds of articles.
[00:11:32.527 --> 00:11:35.789]  There are multiple articles every day.
[00:11:36.610 --> 00:11:46.094]  Where they are setting the precedent, and in many cases you don't get a trial, you don't get a jury, you don't get to face your accusers, you are indefinitely held.
[00:11:47.414 --> 00:11:55.778]  I have seen cases where they're taking someone's property, which they own, and the Forest Service, when the person goes into federal court, the judge says, this is maritime administration.
[00:11:56.718 --> 00:11:57.918]  You are under admiralty.
[00:11:58.458 --> 00:12:01.519]  Do not even speak in the court or you will be arrested.
[00:12:01.999 --> 00:12:02.980]  No defenses allowed.
[00:12:03.020 --> 00:12:05.460]  She tried to rise and they said that's it.
[00:12:05.540 --> 00:12:07.041]  Arrest her and put her in prison.
[00:12:07.301 --> 00:12:10.381]  I mean, I have to read these federal court cases, these state court cases.
[00:12:10.822 --> 00:12:13.302]  There is a reign of terror going on.
[00:12:13.662 --> 00:12:20.184]  People that criticize the government are grabbed and held for eight years, force-drugged even before the Patriot Act was passed.
[00:12:20.464 --> 00:12:24.265]  Prominent doctors like Charles T. Sell have exposed Waco massacres.
[00:12:25.433 --> 00:12:26.795]  This is going on.
[00:12:26.815 --> 00:12:28.198]  This is happening.
[00:12:28.238 --> 00:12:30.962]  And so I'm tired of the denials, okay?
[00:12:32.104 --> 00:12:36.452]  They're saying the Patriot Act applies to all criminal investigations.
[00:12:37.879 --> 00:12:39.159]  That is how it is written.
[00:12:39.219 --> 00:12:44.621]  That is how my analysis, written two days after it became public, of H.R.
[00:12:44.781 --> 00:12:56.605]  3162, then my analysis of Patriot Act II, that was looked at by a bunch of lawyers and scholars and students, and I won second place of 25 awards in the Project Censored Awards in 2004, and I'm not tooting my horn,
[00:12:57.325 --> 00:13:13.535]  But all of these people write these little hit pieces, even so-called patriots and people, they go out and they write these articles going, it's ridiculous, it doesn't create a database for gun owners, it doesn't say they can secretly arrest you, it doesn't say it's for all crime,
[00:13:13.735 --> 00:13:22.377]  That's because you don't know, I'm talking about these people or their feds, you don't know how to read the lawyers speak and then go check out the U.S.
[00:13:22.417 --> 00:13:22.737]  Code.
[00:13:23.197 --> 00:13:26.518]  I spent days reading it and reading the U.S.
[00:13:26.578 --> 00:13:26.918]  Code.
[00:13:27.218 --> 00:13:33.380]  That's why I had the analysis on target days after it passed four plus years ago.
[00:13:33.620 --> 00:13:37.641]  Again, I'm not tooting my horn, but if I get up here and say something, it's true.
[00:13:38.391 --> 00:13:39.832]  Okay?
[00:13:40.112 --> 00:13:57.780]  99% of the time, occasionally I get a number wrong or mentally I'll quote a name wrong or a date, but literally 99% of the time, because I listen to my rebroadcast many times, I check my facts, you the listeners correct me, I'm almost always right, okay?
[00:13:58.040 --> 00:13:59.600]  And it's because this is what I do.
[00:13:59.961 --> 00:14:05.323]  I was up here at 1.30 in the morning last night working at this office researching what's happening.
[00:14:05.743 --> 00:14:07.064]  Okay, I was on the radio in St.
[00:14:07.124 --> 00:14:08.905]  Louis last night at midnight.
[00:14:09.325 --> 00:14:10.566]  And again, why?
[00:14:10.626 --> 00:14:13.208]  Because I know that hell is being released.
[00:14:13.628 --> 00:14:15.249]  I know the police state is upon us.
[00:14:15.369 --> 00:14:17.931]  I know my family and your family's in danger.
[00:14:18.151 --> 00:14:21.373]  And I know that I better get the facts and bring them to you, and I am.
[00:14:21.393 --> 00:14:29.098]  Now people are always shocked when they call here and go, I got a brother who talked to a trucker who said he delivered camp.
[00:14:29.983 --> 00:14:35.273]  You know, these mobile prisons to a secret facility.
[00:14:35.294 --> 00:14:35.975]  Well, where is it?
[00:14:35.995 --> 00:14:36.656]  Well, I don't know.
[00:14:36.776 --> 00:14:37.257]  I heard it.
[00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:38.941]  Okay.
[00:14:40.146 --> 00:14:42.107]  And I'll just go, look, you don't have to do that.
[00:14:42.127 --> 00:14:43.027]  We have Senate hearings.
[00:14:43.047 --> 00:14:44.008]  We have Rex 84.
[00:14:44.068 --> 00:14:45.068]  We have our own documents.
[00:14:45.088 --> 00:14:46.109]  We have our own admissions.
[00:14:46.449 --> 00:14:47.589]  Please go to the documents.
[00:14:48.170 --> 00:14:52.332]  But there's almost a disease out there where people don't want to go to the documents.
[00:14:52.372 --> 00:14:55.993]  Well, let me just take you to the documents, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:14:56.033 --> 00:14:58.554]  Let me just read this article that we wrote yesterday.
[00:14:58.594 --> 00:15:04.217]  And every claim we make is a hyperlink to the documents, to the legislation, to the executive orders, alright?
[00:15:05.251 --> 00:15:10.415]  So listen up and listen up good, especially police and others that are still in denial, people that work for this system.
[00:15:11.456 --> 00:15:21.104]  Don't tell me later, after America falls and all this happens, and then you wish to heaven you had done something, don't tell me you didn't know, and don't tell me you weren't warned, alright?
[00:15:21.485 --> 00:15:23.186]  You're forewarned, you've been told.
[00:15:23.606 --> 00:15:28.831]  And you think you're going to be part of it, some of you, when you're sitting there wishing, when you're getting abused by this system.
[00:15:28.871 --> 00:15:31.373]  I want you to remember, I'm talking to you.
[00:15:33.035 --> 00:15:36.316]  Gulags for American citizens in final planning stages.
[00:15:36.376 --> 00:15:41.638]  Halliburton sex slave trade criminals prepare camps for political dissidents.
[00:15:44.758 --> 00:15:46.219]  Bush administration and U.S.
[00:15:46.319 --> 00:15:53.261]  Army preparations to target American citizens and intern them in forced labor camps has vastly accelerated in the past month and
[00:15:54.494 --> 00:16:00.698]  Commentators from all over the political spectrum are sounding the alarm bells that the roundups may begin soon after this stage attack.
[00:16:01.358 --> 00:16:10.304]  Once the bane of the media's stereotypical tinfoil hat-wearing caricatures, concentration camps in America are now serious news and no one is laughing.
[00:16:10.664 --> 00:16:18.849]  Following the news first given wide attention by this website, the Halliburton subsidiary Kellogg, Brown & Root has been awarded $385 million contract.
[00:16:18.889 --> 00:16:21.131]  Remember, they run Camp X-Ray and the foreign camps and all of it.
[00:16:21.756 --> 00:16:27.622]  By Homeland Security to construct detention and processing facilities in the event of a national emergency.
[00:16:28.122 --> 00:16:38.813]  The Alternet site put together an alarming report that collated all the latest information and plans to initiate internment of political subversives and Muslims after the next major terror attack in the U.S.
[00:16:39.253 --> 00:16:52.616]  The article highlighted the disturbing comments of Senator Lindsey Graham, who encouraged torture supporting Alberto Gonzales to, quote, target Fifth Columnists, Americans who showed his loyalty and sympathized with the enemy by protesting the war, whoever they may be.
[00:16:53.176 --> 00:16:59.077]  It is important to stress that the historical precedent mirrors exactly what the Halliburton camp deal outlines.
[00:16:59.217 --> 00:17:01.378]  Oliver North's Reagan-era Rex 84
[00:17:02.358 --> 00:17:03.858]  That was the cover for the camp building.
[00:17:03.919 --> 00:17:05.479]  It was really for American citizens.
[00:17:05.539 --> 00:17:07.019]  Exactly what they're saying now.
[00:17:07.039 --> 00:17:08.120]  Go read the Houston Chronicle.
[00:17:08.320 --> 00:17:10.541]  But they admit, oh and for Americans too.
[00:17:22.108 --> 00:17:32.143]  The real agenda, just as it was with Halliburton gulags, was the use, uh, the cover of rounding up immigrants and illegal aliens as a smokescreen for targeting political dissidents.
[00:17:32.163 --> 00:17:36.930]  In 67-71, the FBI kept a list of persons to be rounded up, a subversive dubbed AIDX list.
[00:17:38.226 --> 00:17:39.287]  It's the red and blue list, folks.
[00:17:39.327 --> 00:17:45.631]  The current terrorist suspect list was recently revealed to contain the names of 325,000 Americans, and it goes on.
[00:17:46.031 --> 00:17:53.016]  Halliburton, through their KBR subsidiary, is the same company that built most of the new major detention camps in Iraq and Afghanistan.
[00:17:53.056 --> 00:17:59.100]  KBR have been embroiled in human sex slave trade, and their representatives have lobbied to continue it on Capitol Hill.
[00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:00.061]  Chicago Tribune.
[00:18:00.301 --> 00:18:03.543]  I mean, this is the type of demonic evil, just openly
[00:18:03.963 --> 00:18:04.303]  Admit it.
[00:18:04.584 --> 00:18:05.184]  Yeah, we do it.
[00:18:05.204 --> 00:18:05.885]  We're going to keep doing it.
[00:18:05.905 --> 00:18:07.066]  There's nothing you can do.
[00:18:07.246 --> 00:18:08.527]  There's nothing you can do.
[00:18:09.788 --> 00:18:11.289]  And we're taking you over.
[00:18:11.689 --> 00:18:13.631]  You think they're just going to do that over there and not do it here?
[00:18:13.671 --> 00:18:14.692]  They're bold.
[00:18:15.032 --> 00:18:15.933]  They're bold.
[00:18:15.973 --> 00:18:16.694]  They're evil.
[00:18:17.794 --> 00:18:18.955]  Again, I want cops listening.
[00:18:18.995 --> 00:18:19.716]  Go to my website.
[00:18:19.776 --> 00:18:21.057]  Link through the Chicago Tribune.
[00:18:21.357 --> 00:18:22.578]  Kidnapping women and children.
[00:18:22.658 --> 00:18:22.919]  Read it.
[00:18:23.119 --> 00:18:24.220]  It's just publicly admitted.
[00:18:24.300 --> 00:18:24.980]  Not debatable.
[00:18:25.641 --> 00:18:26.782]  And that's who you work for.
[00:18:26.842 --> 00:18:27.983]  That's this government, okay?
[00:18:29.668 --> 00:18:36.131]  And it continues, we have a company that has been handed a contract to build prison camps in America that is engaging in trafficking young girls and women.
[00:18:36.491 --> 00:18:38.853]  Can this horror movie get any more frightening?
[00:18:40.153 --> 00:18:55.581]  A much discussed and circulated report, the Pentagon Civilian Inmate Labor Camp Program has recently been updated and the revisions detail a template for developing agreements between Army and corrections facilities for the use of civilian inmate labor on Army installations as forced labor.
[00:18:55.821 --> 00:18:56.361]  Go read it!
[00:18:56.621 --> 00:18:58.162]  You'll be on the Army's website when you do!
[00:18:58.914 --> 00:19:11.626]  The plan is clearly to swallow up disenfranchised groups like prisoners and Muslims at first and then extend the policy to include a fifth columnist, otherwise known as anyone who disagrees, with the government exercising their constitutional rights.
[00:19:11.686 --> 00:19:12.627]  Anyone that disagrees with us
[00:19:13.607 --> 00:19:15.228]  Engaging in our own constitutional rights.
[00:19:15.788 --> 00:19:22.512]  Respected author Peter Dale Scott speculated that detention centers could be used to detain American citizens if the Bush Administration were to declare martial law.
[00:19:22.532 --> 00:19:29.136]  Daniel Ellsberg, former Special Assistant to the Secretary of Defense, called the plan preparation for a roundup after the next 9-11.
[00:19:29.717 --> 00:19:31.078]  And it went on and to centers.
[00:19:31.138 --> 00:19:38.202]  They've already done this on a smaller scale with the special registration detention of immigrant men from Muslim countries at the Guantanamo Bay.
[00:19:38.934 --> 00:19:42.155]  And then I have something even more unbelievable.
[00:19:42.235 --> 00:19:44.736]  We now have the documents from Homeland Security.
[00:19:45.036 --> 00:19:49.957]  We know the name of the program, and the name of the program is End Game.
[00:19:50.477 --> 00:19:52.258]  Codename, End Game.
[00:19:52.718 --> 00:19:55.519]  I mean, how sick does it get?
[00:19:55.759 --> 00:20:00.200]  And it says in End Game that they're gonna take our guns and put us in camps!
[00:20:01.972 --> 00:20:06.053]  If the cost of your prescriptions are getting out of control, you want to listen carefully to this.

[00:20:59.938 --> 00:21:03.280]  The most comprehensive edition ever published.

[00:22:02.068 --> 00:22:03.690]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:22:03.830 --> 00:22:07.934]  You know murky water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[00:22:08.074 --> 00:22:10.936]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[00:22:11.037 --> 00:22:17.763]  The powerful black murky purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[00:22:17.943 --> 00:22:20.946]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[00:22:21.146 --> 00:22:23.528]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[00:22:23.669 --> 00:22:26.251]  Black murky elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria,
[00:22:26.271 --> 00:22:26.771]  We're good to go!
[00:22:54.248 --> 00:23:11.983]  TriVortex Technology features subtle energy products that include an item called Tri-Vibes that allow you to save hundreds of dollars by wearing, rather than orally taking, vitamins and nutrients.

[00:23:57.193 --> 00:24:03.817]  You know, this is a pretty heavy subject we're covering.
[00:24:03.857 --> 00:24:09.000]  We'll, uh, lighten it up a little bit coming up in the next segment when we get back into all these camps.
[00:24:15.417 --> 00:24:16.458]  So this is all official.
[00:24:16.758 --> 00:24:18.519]  This is Operation Endgame.
[00:24:19.359 --> 00:24:21.400]  And here's a story out of Pacific News Service.
[00:24:21.580 --> 00:24:22.301]  Ten-year U.S.
[00:24:22.401 --> 00:24:24.042]  strategic plan for detention camps.
[00:24:25.342 --> 00:24:27.303]  Revived proposals from Oliver North.
[00:24:27.423 --> 00:24:33.607]  And later in the third hour, I'm going to play the audio from the Senate congressional testimony where they admitted all of this.
[00:24:33.687 --> 00:24:35.988]  And then the late Henry B. Gonzalez talking about it.
[00:24:36.048 --> 00:24:40.210]  The government using terror to arrest American citizens as a pretext.
[00:24:41.309 --> 00:24:41.970]  Ten-year U.S.
[00:24:41.990 --> 00:24:43.652]  strategic plan for detention camps.
[00:24:44.253 --> 00:24:45.895]  Revised proposal from Oliver Nort.
[00:24:46.784 --> 00:24:47.324]  And it goes on.
[00:24:47.344 --> 00:24:56.988]  The Halliburton subsidiary KBR announced January 24th that it had been awarded a $385 million contingency contract with the Department of Homeland Security to build detention camps.
[00:24:57.028 --> 00:25:09.873]  Two weeks later, February 6th, Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff announced that the fiscal year 2007 federal budget would allocate over $400 million to add 6,700 additional detention beds, an increase of 32% over 2006.
[00:25:10.393 --> 00:25:14.154]  And again, they already built three one-million-man camps in 2003.
[00:25:14.434 --> 00:25:15.875]  Even Newsmax picked up on that.
[00:25:16.315 --> 00:25:21.198]  The 400 million allocation is more than a four-fold increase over the fiscal year 2006 budget.
[00:25:21.258 --> 00:25:32.083]  See what the globalists do is, they'll have 50 different programs, and that's about how many there are with this, and then reporters will all report on one, or two, or three, or four, and if we even try to report on all of them, it'll take three hours.
[00:25:32.363 --> 00:25:33.244]  But we've done that here.
[00:25:34.441 --> 00:25:42.586]  Both of the contract and the budget allocation are in partial fulfillment of an ambitious 10-year Homeland Security Strategic Plan code named Endgame, authorized in 2003.
[00:25:42.786 --> 00:25:45.447]  You can link through and read the declassified summary.
[00:25:45.828 --> 00:25:51.671]  According to a 49-page Homeland Security document in the plan, Endgame expands a mission first articulated
[00:25:52.291 --> 00:25:57.016]  In the Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798, that's a quote from the bill, from the document.
[00:25:57.336 --> 00:26:10.770]  Its goal is the capacity, capability to remove all removable aliens, including illegal, economic migrants, aliens who've committed criminal acts, asylum seekers, or enemy combatants, anybody that criticizes the government or potential terrorists.
[00:26:10.810 --> 00:26:11.771]  These are quotes here.
[00:26:12.111 --> 00:26:18.798]  There is no question the Bush administration is under considerable political pressure to increase the detentions and it just goes on and on and on.
[00:26:19.078 --> 00:26:27.607]  So it's called Operation Endgame and back in 1986 it comes up in the Congressional House and Senate joint hearings.
[00:26:28.327 --> 00:26:34.111]  And Jack Brooks says, I've read it in the Miami Papers, that you claim it's going to be for illegal aliens, but it's really for American citizens.
[00:26:34.131 --> 00:26:36.132]  And then Rex 84 was declassified.
[00:26:36.433 --> 00:26:37.814]  Illegal aliens is the cover.
[00:26:38.014 --> 00:26:38.974]  Bush wants amnesty.
[00:26:39.034 --> 00:26:39.935]  He wants open borders.
[00:26:40.115 --> 00:26:42.076]  But oh, don't worry, we're building camps for illegals.
[00:26:42.437 --> 00:26:51.383]  But then they lied back in 86, and now they admit, oh, and for emergencies, and for American citizens, during terrorist attacks, during crises.
[00:26:52.432 --> 00:26:53.253]  This is happening.
[00:26:53.693 --> 00:26:59.037]  And I want the callers today, and you can bring up any issue you want, we don't screen the calls, but I'd like you to bring this up.
[00:26:59.117 --> 00:27:00.938]  I'd like you to focus in on this.
[00:27:00.978 --> 00:27:04.881]  I'd like to get calls that are, uh, hey Alex, I checked out the documents.
[00:27:04.921 --> 00:27:10.845]  Yes, I read Civilian Inmate Labor Camp Program, uh, the new updated Army Regulation 210-35.
[00:27:11.486 --> 00:27:18.291]  I mean, I want you, cops listening, bureaucrats listening, FBI agents, most of you are compartmentalized, I want you to go read it.
[00:27:18.311 --> 00:27:19.692]  I mean, I want you to see it.
[00:27:20.152 --> 00:27:32.858]  I have, right here, the Sun, the New York Sun, saying Patriot Act searches apply to non-terrorist judges, say all types of criminal investigations at the local and state level.
[00:27:33.618 --> 00:27:34.198]  Here it is!
[00:27:34.559 --> 00:27:36.039]  We're all terrorists!
[00:27:36.259 --> 00:27:37.360]  We're all evil!
[00:27:37.780 --> 00:27:39.121]  All crime is terrorism!
[00:27:39.441 --> 00:27:41.962]  Under Section 802 of the USA Patriot Act.
[00:27:41.982 --> 00:27:48.725]  If you look at this new, expanded Patriot Act, it's on the verge of being signed and passed and signed, it openly says
[00:27:49.793 --> 00:28:11.214]  In there, that the Secret Service will be the new national police force over all the police, even when quote, officials or protected persons aren't around, and they can just arbitrarily arrest you and charge you a year and a half in jail, huge fines, on the low side, even higher in some cases, they can just say, this is a free speech zone, you're not allowed to be in this controlled area, you're all arrested.
[00:28:12.139 --> 00:28:17.543]  We live in the age where, you know, the rock star Morrissey simply criticizes the government mildly.
[00:28:17.743 --> 00:28:29.352]  We wrote an article a few days ago, actually, Steve Watson did, from prisonplanet.com and infowars.net, and it had the song lyrics that made the government so mad in it.
[00:28:29.633 --> 00:28:33.876]  And it was just milquetoast stuff about how the British had abused the Irish.
[00:28:34.466 --> 00:28:35.747]  And so they arrested him.
[00:28:35.787 --> 00:28:36.887]  The FBI was there.
[00:28:37.148 --> 00:28:38.208]  They said, are you a terrorist?
[00:28:38.248 --> 00:28:39.449]  We may keep you in jail.
[00:28:39.749 --> 00:28:41.250]  You'll basically keep your mouth shut.
[00:28:41.310 --> 00:28:46.613]  People at malls wearing Peace on Earth t-shirts are being arrested when they're head lawyers of major cities.
[00:28:47.273 --> 00:28:54.257]  This is happening and the neocons are on the radio, the Michael Savages, a sick, beatnik, hippie leader of the 60s.
[00:28:55.137 --> 00:28:56.319]  Well, he always wanted camps.
[00:28:56.359 --> 00:28:57.000]  He always wanted control.
[00:28:57.020 --> 00:28:58.162]  That's what they always wanted.
[00:28:58.443 --> 00:28:59.364]  These are government ops.
[00:28:59.585 --> 00:29:02.149]  He now says, we're going to put you all in camps after the next attack.
[00:29:02.470 --> 00:29:05.094]  Anybody that criticizes the government, you've aided the terrorists.
[00:29:05.114 --> 00:29:06.837]  Well, let me just tell the globalists something.
[00:29:07.822 --> 00:29:09.583]  We're not going quietly into the dark night.
[00:29:09.643 --> 00:29:10.724]  We're not like the Russians.
[00:29:11.044 --> 00:29:14.506]  As Alexander Solzhenitsyn said, what would have happened if the Russians would have stood up?
[00:29:14.826 --> 00:29:20.690]  And if one percent stands up, when you start trying this on a mass scale, you will be defeated.
[00:29:20.970 --> 00:29:31.616]  And I don't want it to go to that point, but we do not have to be loaded on army trucks, we do not have to go to camps, we do not have to be loaded on helicopters to be put on jets to be flown overseas to be tortured in the Eastern Bloc.
[00:29:31.897 --> 00:29:37.500]  You have a right, just like a black slave had a right to beat his master's brains in and escape the plantation.
[00:29:38.001 --> 00:29:43.386]  You have a right when men in black uniforms come to take you and your family to a camp where they rape your children to death.
[00:29:43.607 --> 00:29:46.550]  Mainstream news, you have a right to defend yourself against them.
[00:29:46.690 --> 00:29:47.711]  Now that's not radical.
[00:29:47.851 --> 00:29:48.532]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:51.836 --> 00:29:52.736]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.237 --> 00:29:54.839]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.859 --> 00:29:58.463]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.590 --> 00:30:07.814]  The illuminated Berkey Base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[00:30:07.954 --> 00:30:14.119]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[00:30:14.399 --> 00:30:22.845]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[00:30:23.085 --> 00:30:30.110]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[00:30:30.410 --> 00:30:35.233]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[00:30:35.453 --> 00:30:40.837]  The Berkey Base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[00:30:41.197 --> 00:30:44.279]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[00:30:44.600 --> 00:30:52.565]  Get the illuminated Berkey Base for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[00:31:01.931 --> 00:31:04.293]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here with an important question.
[00:31:04.533 --> 00:31:06.555]  When was the last time you used pure soap?

[00:32:03.776 --> 00:32:05.437]  Do you know the truth about breast cancer?
[00:32:05.997 --> 00:32:07.718]  Did you know that the race for the cure is over?
[00:32:08.908 --> 00:32:16.799]  The best-kept secret in the country today is that it is now possible to kill cancer without personal suffering, mutilation, and poisoning of your entire system.
[00:32:17.019 --> 00:32:21.045]  Now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaysMedInc's patented methodology.

[00:33:06.397 --> 00:33:08.298]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:33:08.778 --> 00:33:11.599]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:13.620 --> 00:33:16.661]  When I see something really original, I've got to give it some attention.
[00:33:16.701 --> 00:33:19.882]  And it's a little racy, not that racy, but there's a
[00:33:20.965 --> 00:33:27.649]  I think one word that doesn't follow King's English in their latest music video, Death Star, the Arab League, and the ArabLeague.org is up.
[00:33:28.149 --> 00:33:37.294]  The ArabLeague.com is not up yet, and folks, these guys are local Austin musicians, and they have done a great hip-hop video.
[00:33:37.334 --> 00:33:43.677]  They've done some others we're going to be posting, and I was honored when they brought it to us and wanted us to debut it at InfoWars.com.
[00:33:43.797 --> 00:33:48.480]  It's the Death Star, and so we're in just a few minutes going to play it,
[00:33:49.040 --> 00:33:55.008]  And I also want to then take some time to go over some of the lyrics from it.
[00:33:55.168 --> 00:33:57.772]  We're coming infidel, you've taken it too far.
[00:33:57.792 --> 00:34:00.736]  We're coming infidel, blow up the Death Star.
[00:34:01.216 --> 00:34:02.498]  And I mean, it's fancy.
[00:34:02.518 --> 00:34:03.860]  They put a lot of work into it.
[00:34:05.237 --> 00:34:13.741]  It's really a weird mix of Star Wars, you know, the Arab League, the Arabs being controlled by the CIA, and the Bushes, and their real history.
[00:34:14.041 --> 00:34:18.924]  I mean, in just three and a half, four minutes, young people out there can really get a good picture of what's happening.
[00:34:19.184 --> 00:34:21.345]  This kind of stuff is very, very effective.
[00:34:21.645 --> 00:34:24.006]  So, gentlemen, I know you have your security detail here with you as well.
[00:34:24.026 --> 00:34:25.007]  We're going to be talking to two of you.
[00:34:25.627 --> 00:34:31.470]  Gentlemen, tell us both about yourselves, and tell us why you decided to get into music.
[00:34:31.986 --> 00:34:35.727]  First of all, the Arab League is honored to be on the Alex Jones TV radio show.
[00:34:36.087 --> 00:34:36.828]  We're the Arab League.
[00:34:36.848 --> 00:34:39.809]  We're a hip-hop trio from the island nation of Hippopistan.
[00:34:40.089 --> 00:34:42.550]  Hippopistan is a small island nation in Gulf of Oman.
[00:34:42.790 --> 00:34:45.871]  We have no oil there, but we have a big port.
[00:34:46.371 --> 00:34:49.892]  The ships come and go from the Arab Gulf, and we see the effect of the U.S.
[00:34:49.932 --> 00:34:56.994]  foreign policy not only on the people, not only on the people executing the policy, but on the region and the world politics of the entire nation.
[00:34:57.335 --> 00:35:00.116]  This is something that the people of the West need to understand.
[00:35:00.196 --> 00:35:00.816]  And what is your name?
[00:35:00.836 --> 00:35:01.396]  Tell me your name.
[00:35:01.576 --> 00:35:03.117]  My name is the Chairman of the Arab League.
[00:35:03.477 --> 00:35:05.797]  I am here with my good friend, MC4.
[00:35:05.917 --> 00:35:09.579]  When you play George Bush in your video, you look like him because you're so tall.
[00:35:10.399 --> 00:35:11.999]  George Bush, you know... George Bush, Sr.
[00:35:12.179 --> 00:35:14.060]  Mr. Alex... Good man with Carlisle Group.
[00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:15.700]  He worked good with you, correct?
[00:35:15.840 --> 00:35:19.962]  It don't matter who is the public face of the power.
[00:35:20.002 --> 00:35:24.703]  What is important is for everyone in the West to understand, because the people in the East already understand.
[00:35:25.063 --> 00:35:26.904]  It's important for the people of the West to understand
[00:35:27.524 --> 00:35:34.948]  Bush, Cheney, these people are puppets, they are pawns, they are executors of a international globalist policy.
[00:35:35.268 --> 00:35:37.890]  This is important to separate the wheat from the chaff.
[00:35:38.010 --> 00:35:40.191]  Chairman of the Arab League, who is this one, you?
[00:35:41.411 --> 00:35:44.553]  This is my good friend and partner, MC4, MC4.
[00:35:44.573 --> 00:35:46.014]  Tell us why you are fighting the Jihad.
[00:35:46.614 --> 00:35:50.156]  Firstly, I'm into the game for the dope beats and divergence, but...
[00:35:51.036 --> 00:35:55.238]  I, too, have a strong feeling about what the West is being hidden from.
[00:35:55.638 --> 00:36:04.583]  The truth about what is happening in the Middle East, that the kleptocrats are taking over your government, pointing their big weapons at women and children, blowing them up.
[00:36:05.664 --> 00:36:09.406]  Dr. Jamal, I believe, he came yesterday to talk about all the collateral damage that happened.
[00:36:09.426 --> 00:36:11.187]  This is something that you bring out.
[00:36:11.227 --> 00:36:13.088]  We'd like to give big props to you, Dr. Jamal.
[00:36:13.748 --> 00:36:17.730]  And Hippopistan, beautiful island, if you want to come visit, we have a lovely mall.
[00:36:18.559 --> 00:36:20.862]  We have the best Orange Julius in the world.
[00:36:20.902 --> 00:36:21.502]  Chick-fil-A.
[00:36:22.003 --> 00:36:24.465]  And it's as real as Skull Island and King Kong.
[00:36:24.485 --> 00:36:27.829]  Now, let's... Some people are going to think this is serious, folks.
[00:36:28.470 --> 00:36:30.912]  Now, I've got some of the verses here.
[00:36:30.932 --> 00:36:35.277]  It happened in a galaxy not so far away with a dark force mounting.
[00:36:35.737 --> 00:36:37.099]  It's a land in disarray.
[00:36:37.499 --> 00:36:41.003]  He who will and wants to get your way cut deep to the
[00:36:41.812 --> 00:36:42.653]  Do you guys want to read this?
[00:36:42.693 --> 00:36:45.095]  Why don't you go ahead and rap this for us there.
[00:37:00.046 --> 00:37:00.987]  Improve on instruction.
[00:37:01.047 --> 00:37:02.147]  Adding volume to the book.
[00:37:02.207 --> 00:37:04.569]  Running game on the sheep with the ground that they shook.
[00:37:04.589 --> 00:37:05.490]  You know what?
[00:37:05.570 --> 00:37:07.331]  And you guys are much better not at babbling through it.
[00:37:07.351 --> 00:37:11.874]  Let's just go ahead and play what I think is your best music video.
[00:37:12.094 --> 00:37:13.675]  The Arab League's Death Star.
[00:37:13.695 --> 00:37:14.956]  Go ahead and roll that, Scott.
[00:37:27.857 --> 00:37:32.581]  It happened in a galaxy not so far away, when a dark force, nothing could have planned but disarray.
[00:37:32.921 --> 00:37:37.665]  They knew how they willed, and wanted it their way, cause each truth they seeked, now covered the unseen today.
[00:37:37.945 --> 00:37:42.568]  Hacked out an empire by folk and by crooks, like they eventually would a gang that they sensed as they took.
[00:37:42.689 --> 00:37:46.231]  Improved all the instruction, adding more youth to their books, but in game, unachievable.
[00:37:46.251 --> 00:37:51.015]  The only ground that they stood, clans that then motioned by the notion of control of the souls of those
[00:37:51.155 --> 00:37:52.656]  We do exactly as they're told.
[00:37:52.676 --> 00:37:55.096]  Stand in line for their ration as they passion unfolds.
[00:37:55.136 --> 00:37:57.557]  Never twist the iron pin as they tighten their hold.
[00:37:57.637 --> 00:38:00.118]  As they stay firm when Acorn drops a mighty oak crow.
[00:38:00.158 --> 00:38:02.479]  So the tentacles of empire expand and float.
[00:38:02.659 --> 00:38:05.080]  Roots of this dynasty, founded long ago.
[00:38:05.140 --> 00:38:07.561]  By the teeth of the skull and bones of Geronimo.
[00:38:07.621 --> 00:38:08.521]  Wake up infidels!
[00:38:08.561 --> 00:38:10.082]  They've taken it too far!
[00:38:10.142 --> 00:38:11.422]  Wake up infidels!
[00:38:11.522 --> 00:38:12.562]  Blow up the Death Star!
[00:38:12.622 --> 00:38:13.923]  Wake up infidels!
[00:38:13.943 --> 00:38:15.103]  You've paid for this war!
[00:38:15.143 --> 00:38:16.424]  Wake up infidels!
[00:38:16.504 --> 00:38:17.424]  Blow up the Death Star!
[00:38:17.544 --> 00:38:17.824]  What?
[00:38:18.184 --> 00:38:19.845]  With our combined strength,
[00:38:20.846 --> 00:38:26.831]  We can end this destructive conflict and bring order to the galaxy.
[00:38:26.931 --> 00:38:27.551]  I'll never join you!
[00:38:27.571 --> 00:38:29.513]  Spinning speed in a two-blood brother.
[00:38:29.553 --> 00:38:30.334]  He was down there.
[00:38:30.354 --> 00:38:31.315]  He owned Yankee money.
[00:38:31.355 --> 00:38:32.716]  Prescott don't f*** around.
[00:38:32.896 --> 00:38:35.098]  Invested in the Nazis with a bunch of other clowns.
[00:38:35.178 --> 00:38:38.081]  Old man Ford, Tyson, Bush, Harry, Minnett, Brown.
[00:38:38.241 --> 00:38:40.403]  1952, he flew down to get a minute blood.
[00:38:40.463 --> 00:38:42.124]  Bloody war, Nazi in the U.S.
[00:38:42.184 --> 00:38:42.525]  Senate.
[00:38:42.665 --> 00:38:43.866]  God, Grandpa had that vision.
[00:38:43.906 --> 00:38:46.328]  Humper Walker stole the Dole profit from the Holocaust.
[00:38:46.388 --> 00:38:47.289]  George Bush trained him.
[00:38:47.609 --> 00:38:48.990]  Oh, George Herbert Walker.
[00:39:17.749 --> 00:39:18.490]  We're good to go.
[00:39:40.920 --> 00:39:42.541]  We told me enough.
[00:39:42.561 --> 00:39:42.781]  No.
[00:39:42.961 --> 00:39:44.142]  I am your father.
[00:40:07.615 --> 00:40:10.097]  The sun of dark nights, high as the kite.
[00:40:10.397 --> 00:40:12.878]  Lightsaber fight with a nose full of white pride.
[00:40:12.918 --> 00:40:15.040]  To escape fate, bloody death in the insight.
[00:40:15.120 --> 00:40:17.621]  Try to take the credit, but it's just not that bright.
[00:40:17.921 --> 00:40:20.123]  The Bay of the Mountains for government lies.
[00:40:20.423 --> 00:40:22.704]  Burn them as a planet with drones in disguise.
[00:40:22.864 --> 00:40:25.086]  Attracted to power and mass genocide.
[00:40:25.786 --> 00:40:26.907]  It's your destiny.
[00:40:57.927 --> 00:41:01.468]  If you only knew the power of the dark side.
[00:41:02.188 --> 00:41:05.229]  We can rule the galaxy as father and son.
[00:41:07.190 --> 00:41:08.891]  Don't make me destroy you.
[00:41:11.158 --> 00:41:15.161]  All right, folks, we're back live and we've got about 20 minutes left with our guests that came in.
[00:41:15.181 --> 00:41:17.102]  And yes, you're right, you're on radio and TV.
[00:41:17.162 --> 00:41:20.664]  We're going to put this on TV by next week's little interview.
[00:41:20.704 --> 00:41:40.197]  But, I mean, this video, the production quality compared to your others that are pretty good, is just excellent, where you've got lightsaber fights that look just like you've got sets with the blue screen from Star Wars interspersed with a very astute, accurate history of the rise of the Bush crime family.
[00:41:41.258 --> 00:41:44.964]  Chairman of the Arab League and, of course, Habib Rahman Abu Jababi.
[00:41:45.244 --> 00:41:45.805]  MC4.
[00:41:46.646 --> 00:41:47.828]  Pardon me, Commander, what is that?
[00:41:48.169 --> 00:41:48.750]  MC4.
[00:41:49.911 --> 00:41:55.480]  I mean, guys, tell us how you produced this, why you produced it, how you got the idea to mix these genres together, because I think you did it just right.
[00:41:56.818 --> 00:42:04.023]  Although I write several of his songs on our album, this song is actually written by MC4, so I'm going to allow him to explain this.
[00:42:04.323 --> 00:42:06.105]  MC4, tell us what you have done!
[00:42:06.465 --> 00:42:11.448]  Well, Infidel, the first thing we have to do is take a look at the kleptocratic... I am not an infidel!
[00:42:11.489 --> 00:42:12.429]  You are infidel!
[00:42:12.950 --> 00:42:13.870]  Whatever you say, my friend.
[00:42:14.811 --> 00:42:16.812]  The kleptocratic family of the Bush clan.
[00:42:17.353 --> 00:42:19.654]  From long time ago, they've been gun runners, yes?
[00:42:20.475 --> 00:42:22.036]  They run the guns... And opium running.
[00:42:22.176 --> 00:42:23.077]  And opium running.
[00:42:23.137 --> 00:42:24.658]  They run the guns, they run the opium.
[00:42:25.476 --> 00:42:29.138]  And this is what this New England family has been doing for generations.
[00:42:29.178 --> 00:42:30.399]  They're good Christian people.
[00:42:30.459 --> 00:42:31.780]  Very good Christian people, yes.
[00:42:31.820 --> 00:42:34.001]  They get themselves deep entrenched in government.
[00:42:34.402 --> 00:42:37.944]  They send the father, George Bush Senior.
[00:42:38.824 --> 00:42:46.609]  He is the one who is most incredible to me, because a very, very capable man, capable of very underhandedness.
[00:42:47.230 --> 00:42:48.311]  Very sneaky movement.
[00:42:48.431 --> 00:42:49.472]  Very sneaky.
[00:42:49.572 --> 00:42:50.933]  Sneaky like a weasel.
[00:42:51.073 --> 00:42:55.597]  Straight out of Yale, he's working with the CIA on his cover-up Zapata Oil.
[00:42:56.097 --> 00:42:58.179]  He's down there facilitating the Bay of Pigs.
[00:42:59.100 --> 00:43:00.141]  No one ever called him on it.
[00:43:00.921 --> 00:43:02.563]  You know, this, I believe, is in your book.
[00:43:03.163 --> 00:43:06.726]  Or the book that you did the foreword for.
[00:43:06.947 --> 00:43:07.407]  Yes.
[00:43:07.547 --> 00:43:08.127]  The Junta.
[00:43:08.148 --> 00:43:08.708]  Bush Junta.
[00:43:08.748 --> 00:43:09.068]  Yes.
[00:43:09.949 --> 00:43:10.469]  Very good book.
[00:43:10.950 --> 00:43:13.952]  I recommend that to any infidel out there to check out Bush Junta.
[00:43:14.132 --> 00:43:14.633]  Excellent book.
[00:43:15.479 --> 00:43:17.361]  We actually get most of the information from this book.
[00:43:18.842 --> 00:43:21.504]  When did you get the idea to start your own little Arab League?
[00:43:22.985 --> 00:43:23.826]  About three years ago.
[00:43:25.047 --> 00:43:28.710]  Right before, or maybe four years ago now, Mr. Alex, when the U.S.
[00:43:28.730 --> 00:43:33.974]  decided to actually finish the job that it started a long time ago in Iraq and launched the war on March 19.
[00:43:35.435 --> 00:43:42.241]  You know, I'm kind of ambivalent about this because I see it as just one more step in the grand plot.
[00:43:42.964 --> 00:43:44.485]  But then I realized this is not right.
[00:43:45.726 --> 00:43:53.933]  Appropriation of people's resources and killing innocent people for their resources is not something that any honorable and great state like the U.S.
[00:43:53.953 --> 00:43:54.974]  traditionally has been.
[00:43:55.174 --> 00:43:58.116]  Habibi, who carried out 9-11?
[00:43:58.336 --> 00:44:02.660]  Everyone knows that there is no serious people.
[00:44:02.740 --> 00:44:04.942]  Serious people do not dispute that this is some kind of
[00:44:05.422 --> 00:44:05.963]  Black up.
[00:44:06.463 --> 00:44:11.547]  Be it the Israeli Mossad, or the CIA, Al-Qasida, to use Mr. Alex's word.
[00:44:12.307 --> 00:44:14.048]  Nobody, no serious people dispute this.
[00:44:14.389 --> 00:44:19.933]  But what is important is, as Mr. Alex, the theme of his entire life is, this is a war for your mind.
[00:44:20.973 --> 00:44:24.396]  The people that carry out this, these evil, those who wish to enslave us,
[00:44:25.557 --> 00:44:27.578]  They bring this upon you to scare you.
[00:44:27.678 --> 00:44:29.759]  And this is something very critical for you to understand.
[00:44:29.779 --> 00:44:32.561]  You must understand this is designed to generate fear.
[00:44:32.921 --> 00:44:38.325]  And through fear, it make you cowed, and make you weak, and make you willing to go along with the grand program.
[00:44:38.925 --> 00:44:41.767]  And it's very easy to determine what the grand program is.
[00:44:41.807 --> 00:44:42.427]  How do you do this?
[00:44:42.807 --> 00:44:44.889]  Whatever they say, believe the opposite.
[00:44:45.789 --> 00:44:52.373]  Mr. Alex, I want to present to you this one CD that we produced maybe two years ago when we first started.
[00:44:52.554 --> 00:44:53.114]  And this is it.
[00:44:54.028 --> 00:44:54.548]  Thank you.
[00:44:55.328 --> 00:44:56.169]  Thank you so much.
[00:44:56.489 --> 00:44:58.469]  You guys are going to be playing here soon in Austin.
[00:44:59.969 --> 00:45:00.970]  How many sets do you do?
[00:45:01.010 --> 00:45:01.830]  How long do you get up?
[00:45:02.130 --> 00:45:04.391]  How many songs do you rap up there?
[00:45:05.071 --> 00:45:08.792]  We're going to be playing March 11th at Flamingo Cantina 311.
[00:45:10.492 --> 00:45:14.793]  March 11th, 311, the same day as the Spanish bombing, I believe.
[00:45:14.833 --> 00:45:18.594]  So we hope they don't bomb Flamingo Cantina because there's going to be some beautiful people there.
[00:45:19.122 --> 00:45:21.204]  But we're going to be playing with several bands.
[00:45:21.264 --> 00:45:25.327]  The headline band is Maneja Beto, but we will be playing number two about 9.30.
[00:45:25.647 --> 00:45:29.090]  Our set lasts typically 20-25 minutes.
[00:45:29.130 --> 00:45:32.713]  We have many songs, but typically we try to play the best one.
[00:45:33.774 --> 00:45:35.836]  What do you think your best is, Death Star?
[00:45:35.876 --> 00:45:38.538]  Death Star is indeed the best song we have going right now.
[00:45:38.558 --> 00:45:39.499]  Phase Four, very good.
[00:45:39.659 --> 00:45:40.980]  Phase 4, also a very good song.
[00:45:41.020 --> 00:45:43.402]  A lot of people think they're saying, we're coming Fidel.
[00:45:43.422 --> 00:45:45.024]  No, it's we're coming infidel.
[00:45:45.104 --> 00:45:46.445]  No, wake up infidel.
[00:45:46.485 --> 00:45:47.125]  Wake up infidel.
[00:45:47.145 --> 00:45:48.086]  Wake up infidel.
[00:45:48.106 --> 00:45:49.828]  Mr. Alex, something very important.
[00:45:50.308 --> 00:45:52.730]  Something very important the Arab League wants to make clear to the people.
[00:45:53.010 --> 00:45:53.711]  We're not violent.
[00:45:53.771 --> 00:45:54.732]  We don't believe in violence.
[00:45:54.752 --> 00:45:58.795]  We believe in peace, prosperity, capitalism, and fair trade and justice.
[00:45:58.875 --> 00:45:59.996]  These things are very important.
[00:46:00.236 --> 00:46:02.238]  The nature of man is to trade.
[00:46:02.558 --> 00:46:05.361]  The nature of man is to make money and to seek leisure.
[00:46:05.422 --> 00:46:07.103]  This is fine.
[00:46:07.224 --> 00:46:08.265]  We don't have a problem with this.
[00:46:08.445 --> 00:46:12.490]  What we do have a problem with is when your greed overtakes your common sense.
[00:46:12.530 --> 00:46:15.713]  My friends, you're addicted to oil, as the President finally admits.
[00:46:16.014 --> 00:46:22.141]  We're addicted to oil in the West, and this is something that for everyone's, for the sake of the world, you must change.
[00:46:22.461 --> 00:46:27.363]  Well, did you guys hear me talking about all the mainstream news about the concentration camps and how wonderful they are?
[00:46:27.743 --> 00:46:38.406]  It's called Operation Endgame, and here's a major newspaper saying, oh, federal judges and state judges are saying that all types of crime are under the Patriot Act, no Bill of Rights.
[00:46:39.190 --> 00:46:45.979]  Meanwhile, they've got a National Bowl, where more Americans know characters on The Simpsons than they know what the First Amendment is.
[00:46:46.139 --> 00:46:50.425]  I say that's a free country, man, where you don't even know what the First Amendment is, but you know all about The Simpsons.
[00:46:51.086 --> 00:46:53.750]  It's, uh, since the end of the... It is Homer Simpson and Infidel.
[00:46:54.250 --> 00:47:00.739]  Homer Simpson is, in the Simpson Show generally, I've only seen it once or two times, is the barometer of democracy, in fact.
[00:47:01.359 --> 00:47:08.889]  This is my opinion because the biting social sarcasm and scathing political commentary on this program is very important.
[00:47:08.909 --> 00:47:12.274]  The fact that the Simpsons exist at all is a demonstration that
[00:47:12.874 --> 00:47:15.998]  The light that is the United States has not gone out yet.
[00:47:16.218 --> 00:47:24.366]  Ladies and gentlemen, since the end of the war, World War II, the U.S., for all of its faults, for all of its faults, has been the light for the whole world.
[00:47:24.827 --> 00:47:26.669]  The leader of freedom and peace.
[00:47:27.316 --> 00:47:31.398]  Somehow, in the past, I don't know, Mr. Alex, two, twenty years, maybe.
[00:47:31.459 --> 00:47:33.940]  People thought it couldn't happen here, so it's happening worse here.
[00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:35.141]  It's going away, folks.
[00:47:35.361 --> 00:47:35.901]  It's going away.
[00:47:35.981 --> 00:47:42.025]  It's like leaving your house open on lock when you go on vacation, going, well, I haven't been robbed before, I won't get robbed now, and you come back and you're cleaned out.
[00:47:42.205 --> 00:47:43.105]  Who is this infidel?
[00:47:43.125 --> 00:47:43.966]  Who is that back there?
[00:47:44.466 --> 00:47:46.247]  Uh, this is EZ Shahid.
[00:47:46.708 --> 00:47:50.870]  He is our security force, also propaganda minister, very important member of the Arab League.
[00:47:51.952 --> 00:48:05.352]  Izzy Shahid wears many hats, not only the security and propaganda, but he also, he kind of like keeps us on track, you know, he kind of protects us, because although he doesn't speak in a live show or on the air,
[00:48:06.050 --> 00:48:06.931]  Say hi, Shahid.
[00:48:07.311 --> 00:48:07.591]  Hello.
[00:48:08.132 --> 00:48:08.352]  See?
[00:48:08.452 --> 00:48:09.273]  He don't speak at all.
[00:48:10.533 --> 00:48:11.714]  He protect us, and this is good.
[00:48:11.754 --> 00:48:14.456]  This is a very important function for him to serve.
[00:48:14.516 --> 00:48:15.797]  Now, you guys didn't drive down here.
[00:48:15.837 --> 00:48:21.462]  You walked down to the studio, and the police were waving, and... Mr. Alex, we practice what we preach.
[00:48:21.482 --> 00:48:26.846]  We don't believe in the personal transportation apparatus, also known as the gas guzzle engine.
[00:48:27.206 --> 00:48:30.068]  So, we walk, and occasionally we do ride the moped.
[00:48:31.587 --> 00:48:33.628]  But do the ladies like your attire?
[00:48:33.768 --> 00:48:37.330]  Oh my gosh, I want to say a special shout out to my lady.
[00:48:37.750 --> 00:48:38.550]  She's out there listening.
[00:48:38.870 --> 00:48:40.551]  I want to say I can't wait to see you today.
[00:48:41.631 --> 00:48:43.852]  I'd like to send a big shout out to all the virgins out there.
[00:48:43.872 --> 00:48:47.054]  It's been a long time for me here in America.
[00:48:47.294 --> 00:48:48.795]  Okay, alright guys.
[00:48:49.095 --> 00:48:50.355]  I've got a family show.
[00:48:50.395 --> 00:48:53.437]  But seriously, you guys are really, really talented.
[00:48:54.097 --> 00:48:58.079]  How long did it take you to put together the Death Star video that's on InfoWars.com?
[00:48:58.939 --> 00:49:01.160]  It took about two weeks to write it.
[00:49:01.678 --> 00:49:04.200]  And then we film it over New Year's Day.
[00:49:04.281 --> 00:49:05.642]  New Year's Day.
[00:49:05.782 --> 00:49:08.104]  And then the editing process takes about another three weeks.
[00:49:08.965 --> 00:49:10.346]  Well done, Lord Vader!
[00:49:10.366 --> 00:49:13.529]  And where's Dick Cheney today?
[00:49:13.549 --> 00:49:14.490]  You have him in your video.
[00:49:14.610 --> 00:49:15.311]  The evil emperor.
[00:49:15.371 --> 00:49:18.354]  He's always running around in red pajamas with wads of cash.
[00:49:18.414 --> 00:49:19.355]  Yes, yes, the evil emperor.
[00:49:19.875 --> 00:49:21.116]  That is DJDU.
[00:49:21.557 --> 00:49:24.800]  He was unfortunately called back on urgent business back to Hippopistan.
[00:49:25.951 --> 00:49:28.413]  Now, who's the black fella I heard in the background?
[00:49:28.433 --> 00:49:34.457]  Because I've never seen him in any of your videos, but he's got that great voice that comes in and talks about Prescott Bush.
[00:49:34.517 --> 00:49:37.280]  This is my voice, actually, doing the voice of Darth Vader.
[00:49:37.300 --> 00:49:39.021]  Something like George Rupert Walker.
[00:49:39.061 --> 00:49:43.305]  I think the name is something like... What's this big black actor's name?
[00:49:43.725 --> 00:49:44.225]  The big guy.
[00:49:44.245 --> 00:49:46.287]  Well, you did a good voice of a black rapper then.
[00:49:46.487 --> 00:49:47.628]  Who's the other guy?
[00:49:47.988 --> 00:49:52.612]  He cuts in and says, Prescott doesn't screw around.
[00:49:52.632 --> 00:49:53.973]  That is me.
[00:49:54.394 --> 00:49:54.774]  That's you?
[00:49:55.612 --> 00:49:55.792]  Yes.
[00:49:56.193 --> 00:49:56.874]  That sounds good.
[00:49:57.554 --> 00:49:58.515]  Thank you, you know.
[00:49:58.636 --> 00:50:00.217]  You guys can do a lot of different voices.
[00:50:00.818 --> 00:50:03.922]  All we have in Hip Hop Is That It is radio, TV, and like the mall.
[00:50:04.042 --> 00:50:04.803]  Can you do the Emperor?
[00:50:05.666 --> 00:50:06.426]  No, I cannot.
[00:50:06.786 --> 00:50:10.668]  Once more, Lord Bush will rule the galaxy!
[00:50:10.888 --> 00:50:11.728]  Indeed, Mr. Alex!
[00:50:11.748 --> 00:50:12.829]  We will have peace!
[00:50:13.089 --> 00:50:16.350]  In light of your... Do what must be done, Arab League!
[00:50:16.830 --> 00:50:18.651]  Show no mercy!
[00:50:18.871 --> 00:50:23.893]  In light of your talent at doing the Emperor, we want to invite you to be on the show at Flamingo Cantina.
[00:50:23.913 --> 00:50:25.233]  You can do a guest spot there, please.
[00:50:25.253 --> 00:50:25.834]  When is that?
[00:50:26.014 --> 00:50:26.774]  March 11th.
[00:50:26.794 --> 00:50:27.634]  Flamingo Cantina.
[00:50:29.335 --> 00:50:30.595]  No, I don't want to bug you guys.
[00:50:30.915 --> 00:50:31.636]  March 19th.
[00:50:31.656 --> 00:50:32.516]  We would be honored.
[00:50:32.556 --> 00:50:32.816]  March 11th.
[00:50:32.836 --> 00:50:33.076]  March 11th.
[00:50:33.096 --> 00:50:33.136]  3-1-1.
[00:50:33.156 --> 00:50:33.376]  March 11th.
[00:50:35.473 --> 00:50:35.893]  Well done!
[00:50:36.113 --> 00:50:38.454]  You have done well!
[00:50:38.474 --> 00:50:40.734]  Alright, we'll be right back, folks.
[00:50:40.774 --> 00:50:41.295]  Stay with us.
[00:50:42.275 --> 00:50:51.117]  Have a little bit of fun screwing around occasionally, but I'm telling you, this music video will wake a lot of young people up, and it's got, just in four minutes, three and a half minutes, crystallized a lot of history.
[00:50:51.437 --> 00:50:55.899]  Very, very accurate, with people dressed up like George Bush in Arab outfits running around with lightsabers.
[00:50:55.919 --> 00:50:56.879]  It doesn't get any better than that.
[00:51:02.734 --> 00:51:05.596]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[00:51:05.856 --> 00:51:07.418]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[00:51:07.778 --> 00:51:12.441]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[00:51:12.782 --> 00:51:19.527]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[00:51:19.847 --> 00:51:21.828]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has arisen.
[00:51:22.029 --> 00:51:24.871]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[00:51:24.971 --> 00:51:29.634]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[00:51:29.834 --> 00:51:34.237]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[00:51:34.477 --> 00:51:41.702]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[00:51:41.962 --> 00:51:44.384]  Discover the documentary for yourself before it's too late.
[00:51:44.544 --> 00:51:46.285]  Call toll-free to get a copy of Martial Law.

[00:52:01.761 --> 00:52:09.283]  Get the new Berkey Battery Adapter, an inexpensive yet long-term backup power supply for your Berkey Light LED system.
[00:52:09.543 --> 00:52:20.466]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because, incredibly, they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark.
[00:52:21.966 --> 00:52:26.128]  That's why this revolutionary new technology is a bit expensive.
[00:52:26.468 --> 00:52:36.911]  But it's worth every penny because the low energy LEDs are able to provide light all night long for over two weeks on a single set of four AA alkaline batteries.
[00:52:37.211 --> 00:52:37.711]  That's right!
[00:52:37.891 --> 00:52:45.015]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[00:52:45.295 --> 00:52:49.417]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey Battery Adapter.

[00:54:02.182 --> 00:54:08.384]  Alright, the next hour I'm going to open the phones up and cover a bunch of other news and get back into concentration camps.
[00:54:08.464 --> 00:54:13.406]  Our final segment with a talented hip-hop group, the Arab League, based right here in Austin, Texas.
[00:54:13.726 --> 00:54:17.087]  So many great Texans involved in the fight against the New World Order.
[00:54:17.107 --> 00:54:18.728]  What do you think of this guy, George Washington?
[00:54:19.703 --> 00:54:21.744]  George Washington is a visionary man.
[00:54:21.764 --> 00:54:37.449]  I heard he may be some kind of mason or something, but the fact when he is offered the dictatorship or the king of the United States and he turned it down in light of the previously made documents in Philadelphia, this to me is worthy of respect.
[00:54:37.469 --> 00:54:39.409]  Yes, absolutely.
[00:54:39.449 --> 00:54:41.950]  America was loved in the past, now we're more and more hated.
[00:54:42.617 --> 00:54:46.221]  Gentlemen, in the last few minutes, what other topics do you want to cover?
[00:54:46.241 --> 00:54:47.442]  You've got some new music coming out.
[00:54:47.822 --> 00:54:48.163]  Indeed.
[00:54:48.983 --> 00:54:52.867]  When we make the song Death Star, we also make another song called Phase 4.
[00:54:53.228 --> 00:54:57.092]  This song deals with Phase 4, the fourth phase in the grand plot.
[00:54:57.452 --> 00:54:58.613]  Phase 1, 9-1-1.
[00:54:58.733 --> 00:55:00.635]  Phase 2 is Remove the Taliban.
[00:55:01.056 --> 00:55:03.958]  Phase 3 is Mess in Mesopotamia.
[00:55:04.259 --> 00:55:04.699]  And Phase 4 is
[00:55:07.190 --> 00:55:14.954]  The upcoming, potential upcoming hostility against another Arab, I'm sorry, Muslim country, the Persians over there in Iran.
[00:55:15.194 --> 00:55:19.056]  Are there going to be any attacks on Hip-Hopistan?
[00:55:19.376 --> 00:55:22.738]  Hip-Hopistan, like we say, have no resource, only the nice port there.
[00:55:22.858 --> 00:55:27.580]  It's like a great big gas station, all the boats pull up, you know, we have malls, distributors jump out.
[00:55:27.981 --> 00:55:34.524]  So no, we don't anticipate the attack there, because we're peaceful, we have no money, we're just peaceful people who like to, you know, make dope beats.
[00:55:35.696 --> 00:55:40.457]  But the question regarding Iran, Mr. Alex, is how are they going to attack Iran?
[00:55:40.797 --> 00:55:45.618]  Because Iran has Shahab missiles which can reach to London, can reach to Tel Aviv, Jerusalem.
[00:55:45.638 --> 00:55:46.918]  How are they going to attack?
[00:55:46.958 --> 00:55:49.059]  They're going to hit 200 spots instantly.
[00:55:49.079 --> 00:55:50.239]  How are they going to do this?
[00:55:50.459 --> 00:55:51.119]  Sneak attack.
[00:55:51.719 --> 00:55:52.660]  This is not possible.
[00:55:52.680 --> 00:55:53.820]  Imperial bombardment.
[00:55:53.840 --> 00:55:59.461]  I'm here to tell you this is not possible because for sure Iran has at least the ability to make one missile fly
[00:56:00.339 --> 00:56:01.459]  Upon the initial attack.
[00:56:01.479 --> 00:56:03.140]  The globalists want them to attack.
[00:56:03.160 --> 00:56:04.721]  They want to get us into World War 3.
[00:56:04.761 --> 00:56:05.721]  They call it World War 4.
[00:56:05.761 --> 00:56:08.762]  They call it Cold War, World War 3.
[00:56:09.022 --> 00:56:09.342]  Indeed.
[00:56:09.782 --> 00:56:13.824]  But something also very important for globalist people is stability.
[00:56:14.284 --> 00:56:22.126]  And though you can have some kind of creative chaos and have the ability at that point to control... They might be able to stage manage and not have it get out of control.
[00:56:22.146 --> 00:56:22.566]  Indeed.
[00:56:22.586 --> 00:56:23.847]  Stage managing is very important.
[00:56:23.867 --> 00:56:26.888]  You guys are going to be at where coming up in March?
[00:56:27.208 --> 00:56:28.108]  Flamingo Cantina.
[00:56:28.188 --> 00:56:28.749]  March 11th.
[00:56:28.769 --> 00:56:29.509]  3-1-1.
[00:56:29.789 --> 00:56:32.130]  March 11th, so what, 9 o'clock at night people should be there?
[00:56:32.170 --> 00:56:32.530]  Yes, sir.
[00:56:32.870 --> 00:56:34.851]  Where is that located here in Infidel, Austin?
[00:56:35.091 --> 00:56:40.594]  It's on 6th Street between Red River and Brazos on the south side of 6th Street.
[00:56:41.474 --> 00:56:48.977]  Alright, well, in closing here, people want to visit arableague.org and soon you'll have arableague.com up.
[00:56:49.037 --> 00:56:51.298]  We posted your video four or five days ago.
[00:56:51.638 --> 00:56:53.319]  What feedback have you gotten to The Grapevine?
[00:56:54.164 --> 00:56:55.505]  Well, people appear to like it.
[00:56:55.565 --> 00:56:56.866]  They give us compliments.
[00:56:56.926 --> 00:57:00.349]  They tell us that we are spot on with our observation.
[00:57:00.990 --> 00:57:07.195]  And they like the fact that we bring out the Bush family dynasty and what they've been doing for years.
[00:57:08.612 --> 00:57:13.274]  You guys, I mean, this whole genre you thought of, this whole look and this whole thing is really interesting.
[00:57:13.654 --> 00:57:16.055]  I mean, I think it's going to be very effective waking people up.
[00:57:16.075 --> 00:57:16.975]  Thank you.
[00:57:16.995 --> 00:57:30.019]  Hey, Mr. Alex, because you do such good work and you and Dr. Molly want to offer you an honorary visa and passport to the island nation of Hippopistan, where if you come you will see that this is not a look, my friend.
[00:57:30.039 --> 00:57:31.640]  This is how everybody in Hippopistan is.
[00:57:32.540 --> 00:57:33.281]  We like to dress up.
[00:57:33.301 --> 00:57:35.702]  We like to wear, you know, a little bling, bling.
[00:57:36.062 --> 00:57:39.103]  And then we like to make dope beats and distribute these dope beats to the world.
[00:57:39.163 --> 00:57:40.984]  And right now, you are the lucky recipient.
[00:57:41.004 --> 00:57:46.646]  And for those that don't know what dope beats are, that's a... It's a hip-hop slang for backbeat.
[00:57:46.806 --> 00:57:47.646]  Super good music.
[00:57:47.666 --> 00:57:49.027]  Super good music, indeed.
[00:57:49.247 --> 00:57:49.627]  Dope beat.
[00:57:50.586 --> 00:57:53.070]  Well, I am really glad that you guys joined us.
[00:57:53.491 --> 00:58:02.146]  I want to say, regarding your topic for the day, regarding Concentration Camp for America, American people, please do listen to Mr. Alex, and not only to him, but listen to your heart.
[00:58:02.547 --> 00:58:02.908]  You know.
[00:58:03.542 --> 00:58:04.802]  You know something is wrong here.
[00:58:04.922 --> 00:58:06.263]  Search your feelings.
[00:58:06.283 --> 00:58:07.763]  You know it to be true.
[00:58:07.943 --> 00:58:08.943]  He needs to come to the show.
[00:58:09.263 --> 00:58:10.744]  But search your heart.
[00:58:10.764 --> 00:58:14.325]  You know, don't listen to what they tell you on the TV, even the internet.
[00:58:14.525 --> 00:58:15.345]  Listen to your heart.
[00:58:15.365 --> 00:58:20.546]  With the Arab League, we can end this destructive conflict and bring order to the galaxy.
[00:58:20.626 --> 00:58:22.026]  You know that what is happening is wrong.
[00:58:22.366 --> 00:58:24.567]  It is incumbent upon you as an American.
[00:58:25.268 --> 00:58:28.049]  As an American... Well done, Lord Habib!
[00:58:28.469 --> 00:58:34.670]  The inheritor of a great and glorious concept called the Constitution and the Bill of Rights is very, very important.
[00:58:34.690 --> 00:58:35.030]  Yes.
[00:58:35.431 --> 00:58:37.851]  You must stand up and resist it.
[00:58:37.991 --> 00:58:38.711]  Folks, we gotta break.
[00:58:38.751 --> 00:58:39.732]  Thank you for coming in, gentlemen.

[00:59:15.036 --> 00:59:19.399]  Folks, those are the young, clean-cut, white Austin guys.
[00:59:20.419 --> 00:59:24.322]  And they dress up in these Arab headdresses and fake beards.
[00:59:25.337 --> 00:59:27.999]  And, uh, it is, it is just hilarious.
[00:59:28.159 --> 00:59:30.922]  And then they put all this hardcore political news into it.
[00:59:31.242 --> 00:59:33.364]  For stations that are just joining us, you're like, what are you talking about?
[00:59:33.384 --> 00:59:38.748]  We had a local Austin hip-hop group called the Arab League in studio for the last 25 minutes or so.
[00:59:39.348 --> 00:59:46.194]  And, uh, don't worry, we will take that in-studio video and, uh, post that to PrisonPlanet.tv members and it'll probably be on the TV show tonight.
[00:59:46.534 --> 00:59:47.215]  If we have time to do it.
[00:59:47.435 --> 00:59:48.816]  All right, the really serious news.
[00:59:48.836 --> 00:59:50.077]  I want to give the phone number out.
[00:59:50.097 --> 00:59:56.383]  I want to go over the news we covered in the first 30 minutes of the broadcast before the local musicians joined us.
[00:59:56.443 --> 00:59:58.344]  I'd call them actors, too, and artists.
[00:59:58.384 --> 00:59:59.746]  You ought to see this music video they made.
[00:59:59.766 --> 01:00:02.028]  It's high-tech special effects.
[01:00:02.168 --> 01:00:02.728]  Really funny.
[01:00:04.321 --> 01:00:05.142]  Wasn't so serious.
[01:00:05.503 --> 01:00:08.346]  Patriot Act email searches apply to non-terrorist acts.
[01:00:08.406 --> 01:00:13.892]  Two judges say that all criminal investigations of the Patriot Act can be used.
[01:00:14.353 --> 01:00:15.754]  And people are all shocked by this.
[01:00:15.794 --> 01:00:18.818]  They've been doing it since day one, since they passed it.
[01:00:19.138 --> 01:00:21.461]  So I want to go over that and then there's the really
[01:00:22.481 --> 01:00:31.329]  Big news that has come out about concentration camps in America and this new End Game program.
[01:00:31.349 --> 01:00:37.094]  That's the name of the operation is End Game under this REX 84 system.
[01:00:37.154 --> 01:00:37.995]  I want to cover it.
[01:00:38.075 --> 01:00:39.056]  I want to talk about it.
[01:00:39.416 --> 01:00:40.377]  I want to detail it.
[01:00:40.678 --> 01:00:47.624]  And then coming up in the third hour, we're going to have Paul Joseph Watson with a big shotgun news report just across the board, a whole bunch of
[01:00:47.984 --> 01:00:53.891]  Big stories he and I and others have been breaking and what we think is most important and what we've been covering and of course your phone calls.
[01:00:53.911 --> 01:00:59.597]  Here's the toll free number and I'm going to take a lot of your calls and we're going to move quickly through them and we're going to talk about a lot of different issues.
[01:00:59.617 --> 01:00:59.878]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:00:59.898 --> 01:00:59.958]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:01:07.933 --> 01:01:09.813]  And I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:01:09.833 --> 01:01:22.516]  The websites are InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, PrisonPlanet.tv, InfoWars.net, and most of the sites have the same news on them, but there's always exclusives every day to each particular site, so that's a reason to visit all of them.
[01:01:22.536 --> 01:01:23.516]  Why don't we have all these sites?
[01:01:23.556 --> 01:01:31.978]  For redundancy, to have backups, to have multiple servers, to have different webmasters over different areas, to expand what we're doing, give people more variety and more access.
[01:01:32.658 --> 01:01:34.779]  Especially with all the censorship that's coming onto the web now.
[01:01:35.079 --> 01:01:36.980]  Senators back new broadband taxes.
[01:01:37.220 --> 01:01:37.940]  Very serious.
[01:01:38.281 --> 01:01:38.861]  Another one here.
[01:01:38.901 --> 01:01:41.202]  Opposition to AOL's email tax grows.
[01:01:41.962 --> 01:01:45.123]  So a lot of ways to try to censor and control that as well.
[01:01:45.223 --> 01:01:46.464]  We'll go over all of it.
[01:01:47.671 --> 01:01:50.734]  But again, when we get back from break, we'll start taking your calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[01:01:51.234 --> 01:01:55.478]  First-time callers are always welcome, but all callers are welcome.
[01:01:55.839 --> 01:02:09.711]  And again, any issue you'd like to discuss, but if you heard the first 30 minutes of the show, and Bush's mysterious new camp programs, and all these mainstream news articles, and all these documents, and all these admissions, and all these different things that are happening, we need to discuss them.
[01:02:11.238 --> 01:02:14.321]  Being launched today, I believe the new deals are posted up there.
[01:02:14.341 --> 01:02:15.622]  If not, they'll be posted up there tonight.
[01:02:16.323 --> 01:02:23.170]  We are offering the special we offered during Christmas holidays of 5.3 months free.
[01:02:23.971 --> 01:02:26.813]  Normally you get 3 months free when you get a yearly membership at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:02:27.574 --> 01:02:33.520]  Well today, for the next month, through March, and that's it, through the month of March, we're talking about

[01:03:01.201 --> 01:03:01.622]  I think so.
[01:03:17.037 --> 01:03:18.557]  A treasure trove of information.
[01:03:18.657 --> 01:03:22.178]  And you can download off the site and burn copies of my films.
[01:03:22.538 --> 01:03:27.300]  You can download and burn copies of all my films, print up copies of my book, Paul Watson's book, give them to people.
[01:03:27.360 --> 01:03:30.180]  It is a dynamo activist center.
[01:03:30.240 --> 01:03:32.441]  It is absolutely amazing.
[01:03:32.841 --> 01:03:35.201]  PrisonPlanet.TV.
[01:03:35.481 --> 01:03:37.542]  And I want to thank all of you out there that have become members.
[01:03:37.982 --> 01:03:45.173]  Of PrisonPlanet.tv that have made it all possible because we're expanding the websites, the webmasters, the writers, everything we do because of your support.
[01:03:45.193 --> 01:03:48.878]  It all goes back in to the fight against the New World Order.
[01:03:49.118 --> 01:03:49.779]  We'll be right back.
[01:03:49.799 --> 01:03:50.260]  Stay with us.
[01:03:55.089 --> 01:03:56.150]  The War on Terrorism.
[01:03:56.470 --> 01:03:59.251]  Will it be fought overseas, or will it affect us here at home?
[01:03:59.511 --> 01:04:03.674]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[01:04:04.094 --> 01:04:04.934]  So what do you do?
[01:04:05.234 --> 01:04:09.837]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[01:04:10.297 --> 01:04:12.418]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[01:04:12.918 --> 01:04:13.779]  Sheltering in place.
[01:04:14.218 --> 01:04:27.611]  Surviving Acts of Terrorism from Biological, Chemical, and Radioactive Fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[01:04:27.651 --> 01:04:34.777]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[01:04:35.078 --> 01:04:38.241]  Get this critical video every American needs for only $29 plus shipping.
[01:04:39.902 --> 01:04:41.925]  Order by calling New Millennium today at 888-803-4438.
[01:04:42.045 --> 01:04:42.746]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:04:42.826 --> 01:04:44.328]  Or order on the web at Berkeywater.com.
[01:04:53.931 --> 01:05:01.336]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[01:05:01.576 --> 01:05:06.319]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[01:05:06.539 --> 01:05:12.203]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[01:05:12.423 --> 01:05:16.967]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[01:05:17.187 --> 01:05:24.333]  The cashless society control grid, implantable microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[01:05:24.354 --> 01:05:25.134]  soil, the U.S.A.
[01:05:25.174 --> 01:05:28.897]  Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[01:05:29.058 --> 01:05:31.580]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[01:05:31.800 --> 01:05:38.506]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.
[01:05:38.746 --> 01:05:43.990]  Order online now at Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling 1-888-253-3139.
[01:05:44.010 --> 01:05:44.431]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:05:53.055 --> 01:05:54.756]  What causes foods to spoil?
[01:05:55.177 --> 01:05:58.159]  All produce produces a natural gas which causes ripening.
[01:05:58.479 --> 01:06:03.764]  In addition, foods like onions and garlic emit odors, causing foods to lose their freshness and flavor.
[01:06:04.064 --> 01:06:13.612]  Now there's Forever Fresh for the fridge, a revolutionary new product proven to eliminate refrigerator odors, and guaranteed to keep produce fresh at least twice as long as normal.
[01:06:13.892 --> 01:06:16.074]  Nancy McKimpson of Jacksonville, Florida says,
[01:06:16.374 --> 01:06:19.917]  Since I started using Forever Fresh, everything stays fresh much longer.
[01:06:20.177 --> 01:06:23.419]  Like strawberries, which now last a couple of weeks instead of just a few days.
[01:06:23.679 --> 01:06:27.222]  Jane Burke of New Jersey says, You know, we eat a lot of salads.
[01:06:27.382 --> 01:06:30.845]  I used to throw out the leftovers because they'd turn brown and they'd shrivel up.
[01:06:30.985 --> 01:06:32.246]  I'm really amazed.
[01:06:32.406 --> 01:06:38.250]  Since I started using Forever Fresh, all my produce stays fresher longer, including the leftovers.
[01:06:38.390 --> 01:06:40.812]  Now I just couldn't get along without Forever Fresh.
[01:06:41.152 --> 01:06:49.277]  To order your Forever Fresh for the fridge, visit the web at foreverfresh.us or call toll-free 1-866-NO-ODERS.
[01:06:49.457 --> 01:06:51.458]  That's 1-866-NO-ODERS.
[01:06:54.499 --> 01:07:00.543]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:07:01.143 --> 01:07:04.125]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:05.345 --> 01:07:06.247]  Ten year U.S.
[01:07:06.267 --> 01:07:10.413]  strategic plan for detention camps revises proposals from all over North.
[01:07:10.894 --> 01:07:13.458]  I had made this point the last few weeks and I was very thankful to see...
[01:07:14.803 --> 01:07:16.985]  A mainstream periodical reporting on that.
[01:07:17.005 --> 01:07:21.288]  They just recycle the same stuff, gulags for American citizens, in final planning stages.
[01:07:21.308 --> 01:07:25.892]  And I can't get over this article we learned of from a listener at the end of the broadcast yesterday out of the New York Sun.
[01:07:26.692 --> 01:07:32.657]  All crimes, all investigations, all of it, is under the Patriot Act.
[01:07:32.737 --> 01:07:33.558]  Of course, that was in there.
[01:07:33.578 --> 01:07:38.101]  We've been telling you this for years, so it's old news for you, but here it is more and more in your face.
[01:07:38.121 --> 01:07:43.185]  I remember three years ago seeing it all over the country, using it in drug offenses, you name it.
[01:07:44.046 --> 01:07:49.511]  And now they're using it against the homeless, just everybody, and then they get on TV and go, we're not using it, it's only against terrorists!
[01:07:50.511 --> 01:07:57.237]  But all misdemeanors, all crime, is, of course, terrorism under Section 802.
[01:07:57.737 --> 01:08:03.622]  I want to take a bunch of your phone calls, we'll also get into some of the things that are happening with the internet, a bunch of other news, some new developments with the port deal.
[01:08:04.537 --> 01:08:09.061]  On this live Wednesday edition, March 1st, 2006.
[01:08:10.161 --> 01:08:13.044]  Let's go ahead and talk to Tom in Wisconsin.
[01:08:13.064 --> 01:08:13.904]  Tom, you're on the air.
[01:08:14.785 --> 01:08:18.208]  Hi Alex, my name is Tom from Milwaukee.
[01:08:19.208 --> 01:08:27.755]  Do me a favor, we don't screen your calls and we don't control what you can say and what you can do, and I'm not saying you're doing this, but some people
[01:08:28.681 --> 01:08:31.003]  Call in and use other people's names.
[01:08:31.544 --> 01:08:35.748]  And so it's kind of nice if you just don't give your last name unless you're a guest on the show.
[01:08:36.188 --> 01:08:39.632]  Just because I don't want to run into those problems of people giving out their names on air.
[01:08:40.328 --> 01:08:40.828]  Alright.
[01:08:40.848 --> 01:08:45.632]  I understand you want to sign your John Hancock to the dotted line and be public and that's fine, sir.
[01:08:45.992 --> 01:08:49.014]  It's just that it's not even a rule I have.
[01:08:49.054 --> 01:08:51.696]  I just would have... somehow people are starting to do it.
[01:08:51.736 --> 01:08:53.397]  I think people think they're supposed to now.
[01:08:53.737 --> 01:08:55.819]  And really, you don't have to say your full name.
[01:08:56.279 --> 01:08:56.579]  Okay.
[01:08:56.699 --> 01:08:57.180]  Sorry, go ahead.
[01:08:57.200 --> 01:08:58.721]  You're calling from Milwaukee, Tom.
[01:08:58.901 --> 01:08:59.121]  Yes.
[01:08:59.602 --> 01:09:06.286]  Last night, United Nations Ambassador Augustine Mejiga from Tanzania spoke at UNHC Wisconsin-Milwaukee.
[01:09:06.746 --> 01:09:08.828]  He talked about when a nation is defenseless.
[01:09:09.512 --> 01:09:09.652]  U.N.
[01:09:09.772 --> 01:09:12.815]  Peace Building moves in its troops and civilian support.
[01:09:13.335 --> 01:09:21.562]  Troops comprised of countries Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, and Tanzania will be brought in and the host country gets to pay the bill.
[01:09:21.642 --> 01:09:21.962]  Yes, U.N.
[01:09:22.422 --> 01:09:28.788]  Peace Building is more of the sell-off of infrastructure and bringing in international, multinational forces.
[01:09:29.148 --> 01:09:30.849]  Peace Building is tyranny building.
[01:09:31.129 --> 01:09:31.930]  It's occupation.
[01:09:34.572 --> 01:09:36.714]  And then also pay for
[01:09:37.116 --> 01:09:39.958]  Housing of headquarters and the troops stayed permanently.
[01:09:40.558 --> 01:09:42.240]  Where did you go to hear about this last night?
[01:09:42.500 --> 01:09:43.901]  Indooridge, Wisconsin, Milwaukee.
[01:09:44.161 --> 01:09:45.642]  And who was there speaking on this subject?
[01:09:46.222 --> 01:09:49.605]  Ambassador Augustine Mahiga from Tanzania.
[01:09:51.926 --> 01:09:53.247]  Well, I read that in documents.
[01:09:53.267 --> 01:09:54.548]  They're pretty secretive about that.
[01:09:54.608 --> 01:09:55.809]  I knew that was going on.
[01:09:55.849 --> 01:09:57.070]  They're announcing it now?
[01:09:57.090 --> 01:10:00.112]  Um, it was there in the Union.
[01:10:00.132 --> 01:10:02.994]  It was a Union ballroom.
[01:10:03.214 --> 01:10:05.296]  Of course, he was saying it was good, right?
[01:10:06.277 --> 01:10:06.717]  Well, I think
[01:10:09.796 --> 01:10:11.837]  I don't know.
[01:10:13.018 --> 01:10:13.958]  I do have a question.
[01:10:14.659 --> 01:10:16.740]  Please tell me how I recognize a globalist.
[01:10:17.980 --> 01:10:19.081]  Let me try to answer that question.
[01:10:19.101 --> 01:10:19.901]  Thanks for the call.
[01:10:19.921 --> 01:10:22.182]  A globalist says they're a globalist.
[01:10:22.202 --> 01:10:25.724]  A globalist says they want a global government or global governance.
[01:10:25.844 --> 01:10:34.589]  A globalist says that they should be able to come in and pay off your politicians to sign over your water districts, your roads, your power companies, your nation.
[01:10:34.629 --> 01:10:35.229]  A globalist
[01:10:36.370 --> 01:10:39.011]  I believe that we should be in 160 countries with our troops.
[01:10:39.492 --> 01:10:52.101]  A globalist believes that national sovereignty wasn't such a good idea and is going to be obsolete in our lifetimes, as Strobe Talbot, Undersecretary of State, when he was a writer for Time Magazine said in 1991, before he was even in the Clinton government.
[01:10:52.561 --> 01:10:56.543]  I mean, I can read you the quotes of the globalists, but it's those that want a world empire.
[01:10:57.384 --> 01:10:58.284]  Good questions, Tom.
[01:10:58.344 --> 01:10:58.625]  Thank you.
[01:10:58.645 --> 01:11:08.190]  And if somebody saw that ambassador give that speech about peace building, very sinister, part of Agenda 21, you can find that at the University of Wisconsin in a few days when the transcript goes up.
[01:11:08.270 --> 01:11:09.211]  Please email it to me.
[01:11:09.531 --> 01:11:10.511]  We'd like to talk about it.
[01:11:10.932 --> 01:11:12.432]  Now, let's talk to Jim in Ohio.
[01:11:12.472 --> 01:11:13.313]  Jim, you're on the air.
[01:11:13.693 --> 01:11:14.534]  Oh, good afternoon, Alex.
[01:11:16.052 --> 01:11:24.655]  On the prison camps, I mean, when you think about it, $385 million after profit and kickbacks leaves about enough money to buy some shovels and dig some ditches.
[01:11:25.795 --> 01:11:30.316]  Well, that's the point I made last hour, sir, that they're only talking about one tiny program.
[01:11:30.356 --> 01:11:39.359]  Newsmax and the Associated Press three years ago reported on the three one million man camps just off of a purchase order, and that was going out to Bechtel and others.
[01:11:40.591 --> 01:11:44.652]  So Halliburton already runs many of the emergency centers.
[01:11:44.672 --> 01:11:48.853]  Halliburton already has built Gitmo, Guantanamo Bay, Camp X-Ray.
[01:11:48.873 --> 01:11:51.413]  They've already built most of the camps overseas.
[01:11:51.793 --> 01:11:59.834]  So this is just one little spending package that just so happened to slip through the radar and get picked up by the Houston Chronicle.
[01:12:00.495 --> 01:12:01.615]  Well, I had another question, too.
[01:12:01.635 --> 01:12:08.256]  I keep hearing about, you know, after the next big attack, after the next big attack, and it reminded me of a quote that I read from a German civilian
[01:12:09.679 --> 01:12:16.737]  in the time leading up to world war two saying that they waited and waited but the big thing never happened to rally around what why would the government
[01:12:17.492 --> 01:12:21.935]  Give people something to rally around, when really, they're getting everything they want now.
[01:12:21.995 --> 01:12:24.637]  They've proven they can kill and disarm Americans.
[01:12:24.677 --> 01:12:29.240]  I mean, Ruby Ridge, Waco, New Orleans... Let me just stop you right there, because you sound like a cogent, intelligent person.
[01:12:29.261 --> 01:12:30.702]  I'm trying to get at what you're saying.
[01:12:31.042 --> 01:12:38.527]  Your first question sounded like you were minimizing the camps, but then your second statement sounds like you believe this is happening.
[01:12:39.088 --> 01:12:39.668]  Oh, no, no, no.
[01:12:39.728 --> 01:12:40.709]  I'm not minimizing
[01:12:41.232 --> 01:12:41.712]  The camps.
[01:12:41.752 --> 01:12:50.014]  What I'm saying is... Well, I'm telling you, Howard Merton's gotten millions and millions for these, and there's three one-million-man camps that were funded three years ago, and these things are all over the place.
[01:12:50.034 --> 01:12:51.075]  They're called sports stadiums.
[01:12:51.795 --> 01:12:52.935]  Well, and that's the thing.
[01:12:53.195 --> 01:12:54.836]  You don't house people in those.
[01:12:54.856 --> 01:12:59.597]  What I'm saying is that they are not building facilities to keep people in.
[01:12:59.657 --> 01:13:03.098]  They are building places to exterminate people.
[01:13:03.298 --> 01:13:03.958]  Yes, I agree.
[01:13:04.560 --> 01:13:08.062]  That's what I was saying about the... But let me make a second statement about why would they give somebody something to rally around.
[01:13:08.362 --> 01:13:09.523]  They're losing control.
[01:13:09.583 --> 01:13:10.723]  People are waking up right now.
[01:13:10.763 --> 01:13:17.187]  They say in PNAC and in Brzezinski documents and statements and books, and they say everywhere, we need catalyzing events.
[01:13:17.587 --> 01:13:23.310]  A Republican big memo came out a few months ago, confirmed, saying we need a big terror attack to get our agenda kickstarted.
[01:13:23.511 --> 01:13:24.091]  What do you mean?
[01:13:24.151 --> 01:13:25.191]  Bush's approval rating went from 45
[01:13:27.179 --> 01:13:31.461]  It skyrocketed to 96 percent, the highest approval rating of a U.S.
[01:13:31.501 --> 01:13:32.121]  President ever.
[01:13:32.421 --> 01:13:34.922]  Now it's dropped back down to 34 in mainstream polls.
[01:13:34.962 --> 01:13:40.244]  Other polls are tracking at 25-26 percent, all-time low ever for a President.
[01:13:40.504 --> 01:13:43.805]  When Clinton's approval rating hit 33 percent, he bombed Oklahoma City.
[01:13:43.845 --> 01:13:45.626]  That is, government elements did.
[01:13:45.686 --> 01:13:46.606]  And then he told a U.S.
[01:13:47.026 --> 01:13:54.749]  City Today reporter on Air Force One a year later after his re-election, he said, I owe my re-election to the Oklahoma City bombing, and it caused the people to rally around me.
[01:13:55.169 --> 01:13:56.690]  Well, that's a quote, brother.
[01:13:56.990 --> 01:14:00.992]  And I agree with you on those, but Oklahoma City and 9-11 were quite a while ago.
[01:14:01.032 --> 01:14:04.153]  A lot of people have woken up, and they've been reading, and they understand.
[01:14:04.213 --> 01:14:05.314]  Exactly what I have said, sir.
[01:14:05.434 --> 01:14:06.214]  That's my whole point.
[01:14:06.774 --> 01:14:12.197]  Ideas are bulletproof, as the V for Vendetta ad states so correctly, for that new movie coming out.
[01:14:13.137 --> 01:14:15.018]  One of the many things, I don't want to plagiarize them, but it's true.
[01:14:15.418 --> 01:14:16.799]  Ideas are dangerous.
[01:14:16.819 --> 01:14:17.959]  They have lives of their own.
[01:14:18.239 --> 01:14:20.720]  Good ideas, bad ideas, good, bad, different, whatever.
[01:14:21.281 --> 01:14:23.542]  And we have to have an awakening, a renaissance.
[01:14:23.562 --> 01:14:29.564]  When I went on air, two months before 9-11, every radio show until the day it happened saying, they're going to attack New York.
[01:14:29.584 --> 01:14:30.544]  Bin Laden's their agent.
[01:14:30.705 --> 01:14:34.346]  They're going to attack the World Trade Centers or, and I mentioned a few other targets.
[01:14:34.426 --> 01:14:34.666]  Why?
[01:14:34.706 --> 01:14:36.487]  Because I could look at their spectrum analysis.
[01:14:36.787 --> 01:14:37.587]  I can look at their data.
[01:14:37.607 --> 01:14:38.987]  I can look at their preconditioning.
[01:14:39.268 --> 01:14:41.348]  They suddenly, two months before, said, here's Bin Laden.
[01:14:41.368 --> 01:14:42.228]  He's about to get you.
[01:14:42.428 --> 01:14:43.468]  They didn't say where he'd hit.
[01:14:43.568 --> 01:14:44.589]  I knew he was an asset.
[01:14:44.829 --> 01:14:45.869]  They were getting us ready.
[01:14:46.269 --> 01:14:47.389]  Not a question of if, but when.
[01:14:47.429 --> 01:14:49.050]  When there's an attack, give your rights up.
[01:14:49.530 --> 01:14:52.870]  They precondition you, so in the back of your mind, you've already heard their solution.
[01:14:53.090 --> 01:14:57.171]  So when they say it again, at the subconscious level, you see it as palatable.
[01:14:57.491 --> 01:15:00.352]  If we don't expose, who's behind the terror historically?
[01:15:00.712 --> 01:15:10.155]  And there's dozens and dozens and dozens of examples, over a hundred, where we know the government carried out the attacks and they have declassified it and admit it.
[01:15:10.435 --> 01:15:16.978]  And if we don't have a renaissance of understanding, they're going to blow a city up, or they're going to do something even bigger.
[01:15:17.018 --> 01:15:18.258]  The events always get bigger.
[01:15:18.298 --> 01:15:19.198]  It's like a heroin addict.
[01:15:19.218 --> 01:15:21.019]  They've got to get bigger to have that same effect.
[01:15:21.659 --> 01:15:26.301]  They're saying, Tommy Franks is saying, on the payroll of the White House, martial law is coming.
[01:15:26.321 --> 01:15:27.141]  They're out pushing it.
[01:15:28.653 --> 01:15:29.514]  Well, and I agree.
[01:15:29.874 --> 01:15:53.287]  I guess what I'm saying is you're saying, and I don't want to put words in your mouth, but you're saying that if they have an event like that, the number of Americans who will galvanize behind them because of what they've done historically, they've galvanized behind the President, is more than those of us who are in the know who are going to, you know, I don't want to say go into lockdown mode, but... Sure, it's not even that, it's will.
[01:15:54.498 --> 01:15:59.723]  The majority of people know something's wrong with the world, but they don't have the will to even tell their neighbors.
[01:16:00.103 --> 01:16:01.224]  They're so afraid.
[01:16:01.905 --> 01:16:04.367]  People need to be more afraid of doing nothing.
[01:16:04.427 --> 01:16:05.528]  The cost is greater.
[01:16:06.168 --> 01:16:07.730]  So that's what I'm saying.
[01:16:08.972 --> 01:16:10.173]  3% started the war against the British.
[01:16:10.193 --> 01:16:12.036]  5% won it, my friend.
[01:16:12.416 --> 01:16:20.206]  It doesn't matter that most of the public is sucking their thumb, drooling, eating cheeseburgers, and doesn't even know what the First Amendment is and are totally mindless.
[01:16:20.826 --> 01:16:21.227]  Okay?
[01:16:21.527 --> 01:16:25.232]  There is a giant cadre, I would say conservatively 80 million people,
[01:16:26.493 --> 01:16:32.556]  Who really have got at least a tertiary grasp of what's going on.
[01:16:32.596 --> 01:16:38.859]  I'd say there's 20-30 million that really know what's going on and our numbers are growing so we all can wake somebody up.
[01:16:39.380 --> 01:16:42.021]  This is what I've been hammering on, sir, and we've done it.
[01:16:42.141 --> 01:16:46.564]  Now this is the majority of Americans in major polls believe the government was involved in 9-11.
[01:16:47.524 --> 01:16:47.845]  Okay?
[01:16:48.045 --> 01:16:49.306]  We've got to do that and do that.
[01:16:49.346 --> 01:16:58.834]  So when they're running around in trucks trying to arrest people, trying to pull, they'll do it in Test City, and, oh, we just rounded up these people, and it'll sound like they're guilty, and, oh, they're bad, and shouldn't we?
[01:16:58.855 --> 01:17:02.057]  And at that point, sir, we've got to get really serious.
[01:17:02.157 --> 01:17:03.719]  I mean, it's coming down to that.
[01:17:03.759 --> 01:17:06.882]  The people need to know who the enemy is when army trucks are driving around.
[01:17:07.382 --> 01:17:10.804]  I'm trying to warn people in case they may back off.
[01:17:10.824 --> 01:17:12.324]  They already wanted to carry out terror attacks.
[01:17:12.344 --> 01:17:15.426]  They've been shocked by how viciously we've attacked them because we're not afraid.
[01:17:16.386 --> 01:17:18.187]  They've been shocked by how many people have woken up.
[01:17:18.207 --> 01:17:19.707]  They've had to issue fake terror alerts.
[01:17:19.887 --> 01:17:21.548]  They've been caught issuing fake terror alerts.
[01:17:21.728 --> 01:17:23.329]  They've been caught issuing fake intelligence.
[01:17:23.349 --> 01:17:26.910]  So they have lost credibility and top CIA agents and
[01:17:28.724 --> 01:17:36.846]  Briefers are going public, former members of Congress, cabinet member positions are going public, saying what I'm saying, Ron Paul saying we're going into martial law.
[01:17:37.146 --> 01:17:38.367]  So they got a problem.
[01:17:38.687 --> 01:17:43.028]  There's a lot more people resisting this than there were resisting Hitler or Lenin.
[01:17:43.428 --> 01:17:44.569]  And we're still armed.
[01:17:44.589 --> 01:17:46.269]  We don't come from a history of being peasants.
[01:17:46.709 --> 01:17:48.470]  And so they got a fight on their hands, brother.
[01:17:50.570 --> 01:17:50.910]  Are you there?
[01:17:51.190 --> 01:17:52.191]  I'm still here, yeah.
[01:17:52.671 --> 01:17:55.692]  I'm going to go back to this point again, then I'll get off the phone.
[01:17:57.250 --> 01:18:02.634]  For them to make something happen, I agree, 30 million people... Well, you tell us, what should we do?
[01:18:02.675 --> 01:18:04.576]  Instead of repeating the same thing, what should we do?
[01:18:04.656 --> 01:18:05.497]  What do you think is going to happen?
[01:18:07.119 --> 01:18:08.239]  That's what I'm wondering.
[01:18:08.319 --> 01:18:13.961]  My thought is that they don't... they're getting everything that they want right now with the Patriot Act... No, they're not.
[01:18:14.061 --> 01:18:14.541]  No, they're not.
[01:18:14.581 --> 01:18:15.541]  We're fighting them on roads.
[01:18:15.801 --> 01:18:17.281]  We're fighting them on taking water districts.
[01:18:17.301 --> 01:18:19.362]  They're getting fought and in trouble everywhere.
[01:18:19.422 --> 01:18:20.462]  They know we're waking up.
[01:18:20.482 --> 01:18:22.043]  You don't think with Echelon they don't know?
[01:18:22.263 --> 01:18:24.263]  The country's hopping mad and knows that they're criminals?
[01:18:24.483 --> 01:18:26.184]  The criminals know that we know now.
[01:18:26.724 --> 01:18:27.004]  Okay?
[01:18:27.024 --> 01:18:27.904]  They understand that.
[01:18:27.924 --> 01:18:29.164]  That's what the police state's about.
[01:18:29.624 --> 01:18:32.545]  They don't want you to have nice shopping malls and nice cars and money.
[01:18:33.105 --> 01:18:35.966]  Their open-stated goal is to make us all paupers, brother.
[01:18:37.094 --> 01:18:37.515]  I agree.
[01:18:37.535 --> 01:18:38.777]  Thanks for the call.
[01:18:38.837 --> 01:18:39.277]  Thank you.
[01:18:39.297 --> 01:18:42.682]  Yeah, I mean, instead of sitting there, you know, we know what the problem is.
[01:18:42.702 --> 01:18:43.503]  We know stuff's bad.
[01:18:43.844 --> 01:18:48.391]  Instead of faltering on exactly what to do, just do something.
[01:18:49.031 --> 01:18:50.634]  Just get up and fight the enemy.
[01:18:53.126 --> 01:18:54.727]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:18:55.087 --> 01:19:00.830]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.

[01:19:47.249 --> 01:19:48.391]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:19:53.140 --> 01:19:54.120]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[01:19:54.200 --> 01:19:58.981]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve Note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[01:19:59.141 --> 01:20:06.943]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[01:20:07.223 --> 01:20:12.584]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[01:20:12.784 --> 01:20:19.766]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[01:20:20.066 --> 01:20:25.413]  A current effort is underway by the Fed along with other central banks to increase liquidity for depositors.
[01:20:25.673 --> 01:20:30.400]  However, an increase in money supply without equal expansion in productivity can cause inflation.
[01:20:30.740 --> 01:20:38.330]  In order to achieve strength and stability, I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver.
[01:20:38.670 --> 01:20:44.917]  While paper investments currently have been driven by debt, gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years.
[01:20:45.237 --> 01:20:46.279]  For more information, call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:20:46.299 --> 01:20:46.519]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:20:53.832 --> 01:20:56.415]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here with an important question.
[01:20:56.575 --> 01:20:58.717]  When was the last time you used pure soap?

[01:21:53.030 --> 01:21:59.917]  For months now, you've been hearing about the incredible health benefits of Zango, the functional health beverage made from the whole fruit of mangosteen.
[01:22:00.057 --> 01:22:12.989]  What you probably didn't know is that Zango joined forces with the leading manufacturer and distributor of functional health beverages like Capri Sun, Sobe, Mystic, and Red Bull to create the fastest-growing business opportunity in America today.

[01:22:57.273 --> 01:23:03.197]  Continuing with your calls, coming up the next segment I'm going to play a little two minute clip from my film America Destroyed by Design.
[01:23:03.217 --> 01:23:08.861]  For some reason so much of what's in that film is now in the news from the ports to concentration camps.
[01:23:09.241 --> 01:23:15.505]  It's a little snippet of Ollie North and it gets brought up about the plan for detention centers for Americans and then we get Henry B. Gonzalez.
[01:23:16.428 --> 01:23:20.251]  Congressman, now the late Congressman, to comment on it, Jack Brooks is dead too.
[01:23:20.271 --> 01:23:24.815]  That was back in 1986, but let's go ahead and go back to the calls.
[01:23:24.875 --> 01:23:26.577]  I sounded frustrated with that last caller.
[01:23:26.597 --> 01:23:31.741]  It was just because he just kept saying, well, I just don't see why they, I just don't see they're getting everything they want.
[01:23:32.802 --> 01:23:35.745]  And they are getting much of what they want, but they're getting more and more resistance.
[01:23:35.885 --> 01:23:41.069]  But they need to get, after each attack, they have to get everything they want done, done, and move on to the next level.
[01:23:41.349 --> 01:23:42.991]  They're having trouble getting it all done.
[01:23:43.031 --> 01:23:44.152]  They're not getting everything they want.
[01:23:44.813 --> 01:23:46.575]  And I pray there isn't another big attack.
[01:23:46.655 --> 01:23:52.321]  And if there is a big attack, we need to be able to have enough people that know the truth and not let these dictators really take over.
[01:23:52.661 --> 01:23:54.083]  Because they're announcing they're dictators.
[01:23:54.123 --> 01:23:55.905]  Bush is saying he has dictatorial power.
[01:23:56.566 --> 01:23:57.426]  It's nightmarish.
[01:23:57.487 --> 01:23:58.468]  And again, he's just a puppet.
[01:23:59.148 --> 01:24:00.670]  Charles in Louisiana.
[01:24:00.690 --> 01:24:01.511]  You're on the air, sir.
[01:24:01.531 --> 01:24:02.692]  How you doing, Mr. Jones?
[01:24:02.752 --> 01:24:03.052]  Good.
[01:24:03.413 --> 01:24:06.416]  If people don't think it'll happen, look what happened in the Dome Stadium.
[01:24:06.943 --> 01:24:08.483]  They're powering people up in there.
[01:24:08.564 --> 01:24:10.144]  They put dogs and bullies around here.
[01:24:10.484 --> 01:24:11.144]  No water.
[01:24:11.424 --> 01:24:12.225]  What was going on?
[01:24:12.305 --> 01:24:12.825]  People were fighting.
[01:24:12.845 --> 01:24:16.486]  Well, that was all a test to claim they screwed up to get more funding and power.
[01:24:16.506 --> 01:24:16.946]  That's right.
[01:24:17.246 --> 01:24:18.147]  But here's the thing about it.
[01:24:18.467 --> 01:24:21.448]  If we're not all bunched up together, they'll pick us off a few at a time.
[01:24:21.468 --> 01:24:22.028]  You know what I mean?
[01:24:23.268 --> 01:24:27.790]  Like, I live out in a country, and I have about three navies and land a couple of miles.
[01:24:28.070 --> 01:24:28.750]  How could I fight?
[01:24:28.770 --> 01:24:34.372]  But Charles, you've given out, what, over 6,000 of my videos over the years, and I've talked to locals that have witnessed it.
[01:24:35.152 --> 01:24:35.432]  How many?
[01:24:36.135 --> 01:24:37.436]  About 6,600 right now.
[01:24:37.696 --> 01:24:43.818]  Yeah, and uh... so the police are all your friends, they know the truth, they threw the feds out in your area?
[01:24:44.098 --> 01:24:45.099]  Good one, sir!
[01:24:45.739 --> 01:24:53.442]  Armed police in three parishes I know of, and you're saying in your parish too, it was in the national news, threw them out at gunpoint because they caught them sabotaging.
[01:24:53.662 --> 01:24:59.204]  The police in your area, you hang out with them, they laughed at you five years ago, now they love you, they're your friends, they woke up.
[01:24:59.484 --> 01:25:03.886]  Most of them aren't bad people, they can just break through the paradigm and realize
[01:25:04.586 --> 01:25:08.810]  I got Mike Griffin on one of the shows, the president here, and they admit that the feds want to take over this parish here.
[01:25:09.270 --> 01:25:10.331]  And I'll tell you what,
[01:25:25.146 --> 01:25:30.831]  It cost $60,000 for one of these FEMA little trailer camps for 18 months.
[01:25:31.251 --> 01:25:31.812]  $60,000, Mr. Jones.
[01:25:32.112 --> 01:25:34.694]  They could have built a home for somebody in New Orleans for that.
[01:25:35.215 --> 01:25:38.758]  And another thing, don't forget about the confiscation of guns.
[01:25:38.778 --> 01:25:40.359]  They don't want you to protect yourself.
[01:25:40.739 --> 01:25:41.860]  They don't want you to have enough food.
[01:25:41.880 --> 01:25:47.305]  We had the military on tape saying, we're here to confiscate all the guns, and that was in a wealthy area that wasn't even flooded.
[01:25:47.325 --> 01:25:49.447]  They're not going to bring you food, they're going to come take your guns.
[01:25:49.587 --> 01:25:50.067]  That's right.
[01:25:50.167 --> 01:25:53.370]  And if they really know the abuse, they had actually
[01:25:53.792 --> 01:25:57.195]  Mercenaries!
[01:25:57.876 --> 01:25:58.437]  Mercenaries!
[01:25:58.597 --> 01:25:59.458]  That's a crime!
[01:26:00.018 --> 01:26:01.260]  Since the McKinney's said that!
[01:26:01.600 --> 01:26:09.448]  People better wake up, or they're gonna be like me, in one of them cells, getting calipried, and getting a little food, and being thankful for that!
[01:26:09.848 --> 01:26:10.789]  People better wake up!
[01:26:11.029 --> 01:26:13.352]  Because being a coward's not the time right now!
[01:26:13.752 --> 01:26:15.514]  There's no place for cowardness right now!
[01:26:15.916 --> 01:26:17.398]  People better wake up and listen to this.
[01:26:17.678 --> 01:26:18.639]  Tell people about this.
[01:26:18.919 --> 01:26:21.822]  And I've been asking them, get these tapes and wake their neighborhood up.
[01:26:22.022 --> 01:26:23.044]  If they just could do that.
[01:26:23.464 --> 01:26:28.710]  If they could just get enough guts in them to wake three or four of their neighbors up, get these tapes out.
[01:26:32.179 --> 01:26:33.781]  You've done an incredible job, Charles.
[01:26:33.801 --> 01:26:41.548]  You've been listening for, I guess, eight, nine years, but tell the listeners, I mean, you're not hyping this, the effect you've had in your area, the police are all totally awake.
[01:26:41.668 --> 01:26:43.470]  I mean, tell people about the effect you had.
[01:26:43.490 --> 01:26:46.393]  Well, when I first started, I was with Larry Nichols, selling things.
[01:26:46.413 --> 01:26:49.156]  They threatened to put me in jail, take my dog, laugh at me.
[01:26:49.456 --> 01:26:51.258]  They even brought me out of places.
[01:26:51.358 --> 01:26:53.740]  It was very embarrassing, but I kept going back.
[01:26:53.780 --> 01:26:55.702]  I would go outside the places, give these tapes,
[01:26:56.022 --> 01:27:00.106]  And after a few policemen got the tapes, they started asking me, can you make my mom a tape?
[01:27:00.326 --> 01:27:03.148]  Can you get me one about Dog Seekers, Bahamian Girl?
[01:27:03.348 --> 01:27:03.568]  Here's $20.
[01:27:03.609 --> 01:27:05.170]  Buy you some tapes.
[01:27:05.390 --> 01:27:06.911]  And I just had phone calls.
[01:27:07.392 --> 01:27:08.813]  People out of the state called me.
[01:27:09.335 --> 01:27:09.955]  You know what I mean?
[01:27:10.035 --> 01:27:11.356]  It's incredible what happened.
[01:27:11.616 --> 01:27:13.196]  I mean, people from the Veterans Hospital.
[01:27:13.256 --> 01:27:18.217]  And so now, now when you walk in, you told the story they buy you coffee and want to go hang out with you.
[01:27:18.237 --> 01:27:25.559]  So again, at first they thought you were evil, but you persevered, and then they found out you were only warning them and trying to save their family.
[01:27:25.739 --> 01:27:27.620]  Well, it was due because I had a record.
[01:27:28.040 --> 01:27:29.660]  You know, but I have to explain it.
[01:27:29.720 --> 01:27:31.181]  I gave them my transcript and I read it.
[01:27:31.481 --> 01:27:33.141]  They realized I was falsely accused.
[01:27:33.461 --> 01:27:36.322]  And a lot of police apologized and it wasn't even involved in it.
[01:27:38.503 --> 01:27:40.424]  I said, y'all can send anybody you want to prison.
[01:27:40.444 --> 01:27:41.585]  They said, yes, right.
[01:27:41.725 --> 01:27:42.825]  It's how we write it up.
[01:27:43.326 --> 01:27:45.187]  I said, well, I didn't do anything, you know?
[01:27:45.647 --> 01:27:47.048]  But they apologized.
[01:27:47.208 --> 01:27:50.249]  But you'd be surprised if the police didn't know what's going on.
[01:27:50.549 --> 01:27:52.830]  You'd be surprised if the police got guns buried.
[01:27:53.231 --> 01:27:55.172]  I mean, they tell you, get a gun and bury it.
[01:27:55.212 --> 01:27:56.032]  Get ammunition.
[01:27:56.332 --> 01:27:57.233]  It's coming, Charlie.
[01:27:57.253 --> 01:27:58.093]  It's coming.
[01:27:58.133 --> 01:27:59.114]  What you say is true.
[01:27:59.134 --> 01:27:59.954]  These tapes are true.
[01:28:00.214 --> 01:28:05.517]  I gave it to lawyers, and the lawyers researched the tapes, and they come and said, it's unbelievable.
[01:28:06.698 --> 01:28:09.119]  I give it to everybody, anybody that listens to me.
[01:28:09.400 --> 01:28:13.862]  But see, the most American people, they want to listen to you, turn off the radio and not say anything.
[01:28:14.402 --> 01:28:15.522]  And that's not the way to fight it.
[01:28:15.783 --> 01:28:17.243]  The tapes are the way, believe me.
[01:28:17.263 --> 01:28:19.544]  They can win over parishes, their neighborhoods.
[01:28:20.085 --> 01:28:21.145]  I'm not pushing the tapes.
[01:28:21.405 --> 01:28:22.666]  I'm saying that's how I did it.
[01:28:22.726 --> 01:28:26.688]  No, believe me, Charles, I know people in Louisiana know you, what you've done.
[01:28:27.108 --> 01:28:28.048]  So many others like you.
[01:28:28.068 --> 01:28:28.869]  God bless you, brother.
[01:28:29.229 --> 01:28:31.310]  More calls coming up on this audio clip.
[01:28:32.595 --> 01:28:33.376]  It's up to us.
[01:28:33.756 --> 01:28:35.258]  You can't count on somebody else to do it.
[01:28:35.318 --> 01:28:37.301]  Charles is absolutely right, and God bless him.
[01:28:37.601 --> 01:28:38.262]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:38.282 --> 01:28:38.783]  Stay with us.
[01:28:43.529 --> 01:28:44.410]  We're on the march.
[01:28:44.911 --> 01:28:46.513]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.434 --> 01:28:50.118]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.234 --> 01:28:55.195]  You've asked for them and now they're here!
[01:28:55.295 --> 01:29:06.000]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Light's Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[01:29:06.380 --> 01:29:10.902]  The Berkey's PF2s simply screw onto the stem with a Black Berkey Purification Element.
[01:29:10.962 --> 01:29:22.308]  When used, water flows through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[01:29:22.888 --> 01:29:29.733]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements, where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[01:29:30.133 --> 01:29:32.274]  Your purified water is now ready!
[01:29:32.775 --> 01:29:37.718]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 host filter elements.
[01:29:38.038 --> 01:29:44.341]  Get a set of two for only $49 or get two sets for only $89 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:29:44.401 --> 01:29:48.604]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:29:48.824 --> 01:29:49.644]  That's toll free.
[01:29:49.664 --> 01:29:49.704]  888-803-4438.
[01:29:53.832 --> 01:29:58.734]  Did you know you could be punishing your diesel engine if you don't use a diesel fuel conditioner in the winter?
[01:29:59.114 --> 01:30:05.196]  Winter conditions don't just call for an anti-gel, but a host of additives, as diesels have trouble in the winter, especially when idling.
[01:30:05.776 --> 01:30:12.738]  SFR Diesel, with its multifunctional additive package, prevents soot buildup, maximizes performance, and improves mileage.
[01:30:13.139 --> 01:30:18.700]  If you want to run longer, run stronger, use SFR Diesel Diesel Fuel Conditioner.
[01:30:19.061 --> 01:30:23.182]  Call 888-USE-SFR-NUMBER-1 for a store near you.
[01:30:24.249 --> 01:30:26.729]  Are your Federal Reserve notes looking for a safe haven?
[01:30:27.190 --> 01:30:29.090]  Mine found it in precious metals.
[01:30:29.810 --> 01:30:32.991]  Not paper promises, but actual gold in my possession.
[01:30:33.631 --> 01:30:40.112]  It is liquid, it is private, it owes no one, it cannot go bankrupt, and it maintains its purchasing power.
[01:30:40.892 --> 01:30:43.092]  Find your answer at Midas Resources.
[01:30:43.473 --> 01:30:43.913]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:30:43.993 --> 01:30:45.373]  The answer is at 1-800-686-2237.
[01:30:53.710 --> 01:30:57.771]  We've all seen the Tornado device on TV and wondered if it really worked.
[01:30:58.232 --> 01:31:07.435]  I was also skeptical at first until we tested six Tornado units and in every case we got more miles per gallon and felt more power.
[01:31:07.715 --> 01:31:13.136]  Gasoline is expensive so when we find something that saves us money it just makes sense to get it.
[01:31:13.397 --> 01:31:20.379]  Call 800-500-8880 and order your Tornado unit today or visit TornadoAir.com
[01:31:23.010 --> 01:31:24.051]  Oil is oil.
[01:31:24.611 --> 01:31:25.652]  Don't kid yourself!
[01:31:25.832 --> 01:31:28.954]  Technology makes better oils possible, like Royal Purple.
[01:31:29.134 --> 01:31:32.316]  Royal Purple reduces friction and increases film strength.
[01:31:32.617 --> 01:31:38.641]  Go to RoyalPurple.com and you'll find independent test results from North Carolina and Oklahoma State.
[01:31:38.801 --> 01:31:40.402]  Not hype, just facts.
[01:31:40.682 --> 01:31:41.442]  What's in it for you?
[01:31:41.563 --> 01:31:46.266]  Superior protection, fewer oil changes, more horsepower, torque, and better gas mileage.
[01:31:46.406 --> 01:31:52.029]  Find Royal Purple at Napa, O'Reilly's, your local high-performance center, and RoyalPurple.com.
[01:31:52.290 --> 01:31:52.630]  Today!
[01:31:54.671 --> 01:31:59.836]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:32:00.496 --> 01:32:02.858]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:32:02.878 --> 01:32:08.242]  Monday through Friday, 11 to 2 Central Standard Time.
[01:32:08.262 --> 01:32:09.743]  Back from 9 to midnight.
[01:32:09.803 --> 01:32:12.105]  Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:32:12.125 --> 01:32:14.307]  Paul Watson coming up in 27 minutes.
[01:32:16.625 --> 01:32:18.386]  And, uh, your calls are coming up here in just a few.
[01:32:18.406 --> 01:32:20.707]  I want to get back into concentration camps in America.
[01:32:20.787 --> 01:32:21.428]  It's official.
[01:32:21.488 --> 01:32:23.169]  It's in mainstream newspapers.
[01:32:23.189 --> 01:32:25.730]  You can go to the Army's own website and read about it.
[01:32:25.770 --> 01:32:27.171]  And it's for your own safety.
[01:32:27.251 --> 01:32:27.911]  It's good.
[01:32:27.951 --> 01:32:30.673]  The troops have been training for decades to take your guns.
[01:32:30.693 --> 01:32:31.873]  They've been giving questionnaires.
[01:32:32.133 --> 01:32:34.555]  Because turning your guns in is conservative.
[01:32:35.235 --> 01:32:37.797]  And that evil Alex Jones talks about our brother.
[01:32:37.857 --> 01:32:38.717]  He shouldn't.
[01:32:39.157 --> 01:32:41.438]  He should trust the criminals running our government.
[01:32:42.279 --> 01:32:45.961]  Here's a clip from my film, America Destroyed by Design, where Oliver North,
[01:32:46.747 --> 01:32:54.694]  And Poindexter, yes, the felon who runs the Total Information Awareness Network today, Jack Brooks brings it up in the head.
[01:32:54.734 --> 01:32:56.616]  The chairman, in a way, tells him to shut up.
[01:32:57.296 --> 01:33:06.344]  And then we got a clip of Henry Gonzalez from the grave now, talking about if there's terrorism, how they'll use it as a pretext to round people up, because they were just reading Rex 84.
[01:33:06.645 --> 01:33:08.466]  Well, why now is the exact same thing happening?
[01:33:08.486 --> 01:33:09.827]  Because they're following the same document.
[01:33:10.608 --> 01:33:12.089]  And now that's hit mainstream news.
[01:33:12.129 --> 01:33:12.810]  Go ahead and roll it.
[01:33:13.405 --> 01:33:21.470]  Now see some evidence of concentration camp facilities being built in America under the guise of FEMA going back over 30 years, but it is accelerating.
[01:33:22.330 --> 01:33:32.716]  Colonel North, in your work at the NSC, were you not assigned at one time to work on plans for the continuity of government in the event of a major disaster?
[01:33:33.197 --> 01:33:42.382]  Mr. Chairman, I believe that question touches upon a highly sensitive and classified area.
[01:33:43.311 --> 01:33:47.852]  So may I request that you not touch upon that, sir?
[01:33:49.312 --> 01:34:09.237]  I was particularly concerned, Chairman, because I read in Miami Papers and several others that there had been a plan developed by that same agency, a contingency plan in the event of an emergency that would suspend the
[01:34:09.696 --> 01:34:15.377]  American Constitution, and I was deeply concerned about it, and wondered if that was the area in which he had worked.
[01:34:17.418 --> 01:34:23.359]  May I most respectfully request that that matter not be touched upon at this stage.
[01:34:24.159 --> 01:34:28.560]  If we wish to get into this, uncertain arrangements can be made for an executive session.
[01:34:29.941 --> 01:34:35.602]  And tragically, the only member who got close was Jack Brooks, and he was stopped by the chairman.
[01:34:36.300 --> 01:34:39.821]  But the truth of the matter is that yes, you do have those standby provisions.
[01:34:40.181 --> 01:34:41.421]  And the plans are there.
[01:34:41.661 --> 01:34:59.326]  And the statutory emergency plans are there, whereby you could, in the name of stopping terrorism, apprehend, invoke the military, and arrest Americans, and hold them in detention camps.
[01:34:59.626 --> 01:34:59.866]  Alright.
[01:35:01.048 --> 01:35:02.570]  And there's a lot more than in the film.
[01:35:02.610 --> 01:35:04.191]  We go through all the documentation.
[01:35:04.231 --> 01:35:07.154]  So let me cover some of this now.
[01:35:07.234 --> 01:35:08.015]  It's so important.
[01:35:08.055 --> 01:35:11.218]  I'm going to recap some of what I covered the first of the last hour.
[01:35:11.238 --> 01:35:19.245]  And then we'll go to John and David and Don and John and Elias and others before Paul Joseph Watson joins us.
[01:35:19.546 --> 01:35:21.428]  I kind of sped through this last hour.
[01:35:21.488 --> 01:35:24.170]  So what I'm going to do now is slowly go through it.
[01:35:24.190 --> 01:35:25.872]  This is the sun out of
[01:35:27.230 --> 01:35:34.436]  The New York Sun, Patriot Act email searches apply to non-terrorist judges, say two federal judges in Florida.
[01:35:34.496 --> 01:35:36.418]  And again, I saw this three years ago, okay?
[01:35:36.478 --> 01:35:38.540]  It's just now, it's really being announced.
[01:35:39.418 --> 01:35:48.887]  In Florida, have upheld the authority of individual courts to use the Patriot Act to order searches anywhere in the country for emails and computer data in all types of criminal investigations.
[01:35:48.927 --> 01:35:50.229]  They're also using it in everything else.
[01:35:50.729 --> 01:35:55.554]  Overruling a magistrate who found Congress limited such expanded jurisdiction to cases involving terrorism.
[01:35:55.574 --> 01:35:56.194]  But they didn't.
[01:35:56.254 --> 01:36:02.621]  Section 802 says the suspicion of misdemeanor, not even felony, misdemeanor crime
[01:36:03.656 --> 01:36:08.198]  Is terrorism, and so you don't get any of the guarantees of the Bill of Rights or Constitution.
[01:36:08.258 --> 01:36:11.540]  And Bush gets up and says, oh don't worry, we're not using this against anybody but terrorists.
[01:36:11.560 --> 01:36:13.021]  You know, this is powers we already had.
[01:36:13.321 --> 01:36:14.782]  No, you didn't already have these powers.
[01:36:15.842 --> 01:36:18.764]  Unless you're talking about asset forfeiture seizures that's been found unconstitutional.
[01:36:18.784 --> 01:36:22.466]  Yeah, taking property without even any drugs being found or a crime being committed.
[01:36:23.026 --> 01:36:26.868]  And this whole national security umbrella is used to hide all of this while they do it.
[01:36:27.893 --> 01:36:34.310]  And literally every day there are mainstream news articles of homeless being arrested under the Patriot Act for sleeping on park benches.
[01:36:35.407 --> 01:36:42.169]  Marijuana dealers, cocaine dealers, topless bars, county commissioners, toy stores.
[01:36:43.450 --> 01:36:44.630]  We've listed them, we've covered them.
[01:36:44.670 --> 01:36:49.252]  I used some of the most known examples, but there are hundreds and hundreds and hundreds.
[01:36:49.292 --> 01:36:55.114]  And now they're arresting Morrissey and taking him in for questioning because he had some milquetoast comments about the British and the U.S.
[01:36:55.154 --> 01:36:55.814]  being corrupt.
[01:36:55.834 --> 01:37:00.276]  So they took him in handcuffs, took him in for questioning with a video camera and said, are you a terrorist?
[01:37:00.296 --> 01:37:01.316]  He said, what are you talking about?
[01:37:02.037 --> 01:37:03.798]  I just said I don't like what you're doing with the war.
[01:37:04.358 --> 01:37:06.459]  Well, we may bring you back in later.
[01:37:06.479 --> 01:37:11.581]  You know, they suspend the Mayor of London for a month for criticizing the media.
[01:37:11.601 --> 01:37:12.742]  There's no free speech.
[01:37:13.522 --> 01:37:15.303]  At least they're trying to claim there is.
[01:37:15.663 --> 01:37:22.106]  And then Congress says we may not reauthorize the Patriot Act, and Bush says, I don't care if you don't pass a law, I'm just going to enforce it.
[01:37:22.446 --> 01:37:29.189]  Hey, you're not allowed to... By the way, I'm going to digress here for a minute before I get into all these concentration camps.
[01:37:32.066 --> 01:37:46.336]  It is now confirmed that the UAE is one of the largest shareholders in, they invested $8 billion just two years ago, in the Carlisle Group and that the Bush's personally have gotten hundreds of millions of dollars from them in investment.
[01:37:46.697 --> 01:37:52.581]  Jeb Bush with his whole scholastic book line, big money there, they're the main investors.
[01:37:53.382 --> 01:38:01.710]  We've got the Treasury Secretary who sat on the board that authorized this handover and then violated federal law, not having the 45-day review, another law violated.
[01:38:02.471 --> 01:38:06.455]  He's the guy who signed off on the deal when he was in a $1.15 billion deal, $1,150,000,000 deal with them.
[01:38:13.182 --> 01:38:22.666]  And then we have their current number two man over the European and Latin American operations of Dupuy Porte's World, who is... They keep saying they're not going to run security.
[01:38:22.706 --> 01:38:23.946]  No, the company won't.
[01:38:24.687 --> 01:38:28.128]  The former head guy from the company will run all the security.
[01:38:29.131 --> 01:38:31.753]  So it's a takeover at every level.
[01:38:31.773 --> 01:38:35.855]  I mean, no one's connected to Saudi Arabia and the Bin Laden family like the Bushes.
[01:38:35.875 --> 01:38:41.038]  No one is connected to the United Arab Emirates like the Bushes, except for the Queen of England.
[01:38:41.058 --> 01:38:46.902]  And type in Queen of England, Karl Law Group into Google, you'll get Financial Times of London about how she's the majority owner.
[01:38:47.202 --> 01:38:49.023]  She basically owns those countries.
[01:38:49.043 --> 01:38:50.984]  They're the ones that set them up 85 years ago.
[01:38:52.365 --> 01:38:56.726]  They basically own the Karloff Group, and then after that it's the Bin Ladens, the Bushes, UAE.
[01:38:56.966 --> 01:38:58.987]  It's one sick, happy family.
[01:39:01.848 --> 01:39:07.789]  And the rattle just gets deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper.
[01:39:07.989 --> 01:39:12.350]  And then I tune into Neocon Talk Radio, and they're going, it's all liberal lies.
[01:39:12.850 --> 01:39:14.551]  They haven't done anything wrong.
[01:39:14.631 --> 01:39:16.011]  It's just they run the poor.
[01:39:16.051 --> 01:39:17.191]  It's friendly.
[01:39:17.532 --> 01:39:19.072]  There's no payments going on.
[01:39:20.393 --> 01:39:21.754]  It's open corruption.
[01:39:22.255 --> 01:39:22.995]  Manifest.
[01:39:23.696 --> 01:39:25.037]  They should be arrested.
[01:39:25.077 --> 01:39:26.498]  He should be impeached right now.
[01:39:26.838 --> 01:39:34.644]  Snow should have to resign and go to jail for taking money from them and then waiving the 45-day National Security Review.
[01:39:36.185 --> 01:39:39.928]  I mean, I gotta have cops pull me over on the side of the highway and ask to search my car.
[01:39:40.128 --> 01:39:40.889]  Well, no, you can't.
[01:39:41.129 --> 01:39:42.830]  Well, it's post 9-11, sir.
[01:39:42.870 --> 01:39:43.631]  We don't need a warrant.
[01:39:44.091 --> 01:39:45.152]  And the border's wide open.
[01:39:45.192 --> 01:39:47.274]  Meanwhile, our government's sold out to foreign Arabs.
[01:39:50.470 --> 01:39:51.311]  It's laughable.
[01:39:51.391 --> 01:39:53.212]  It's all a big, sick joke.
[01:39:53.232 --> 01:39:54.112]  Alright, I've said that.
[01:39:54.152 --> 01:39:55.433]  I just wanted to get that out there.
[01:39:55.453 --> 01:40:07.180]  I mean, it just gets worse, and worse, and worse, and now it's more than 21 ports, and it just gets... And they knew it was more than six when they first reported it, and they gave you the lowest number they can to minimize it psychologically.
[01:40:07.520 --> 01:40:08.261]  This is sick.
[01:40:08.341 --> 01:40:10.442]  And now I'm hearing neocons, a new frightening development.
[01:40:11.062 --> 01:40:14.144]  I heard two neocons this morning make little jibes at guns.
[01:40:15.177 --> 01:40:17.559]  Now they're getting anti-gun on us!
[01:40:18.700 --> 01:40:20.642]  I mean, when is it going to end?
[01:40:23.525 --> 01:40:31.652]  I had these neocon worshippers out at Crawford, Texas a few months ago, and I was out there interviewing people out there who were protesting on both sides, and I'd go, well Bush is anti-gun.
[01:40:31.692 --> 01:40:32.513]  They'd go, so what?
[01:40:32.533 --> 01:40:33.393]  We've got to restrict him.
[01:40:33.413 --> 01:40:34.074]  I've got it on tape.
[01:40:34.374 --> 01:40:35.936]  You're one of them right-wing Republicans.
[01:40:36.877 --> 01:40:38.478]  See, now I'm really evil, folks.
[01:40:38.538 --> 01:40:39.139]  I'm pro-gun.
[01:40:40.753 --> 01:40:41.573]  Or they'll just deny it.
[01:40:41.593 --> 01:40:43.514]  You're a liar, he isn't Antogone.
[01:40:43.534 --> 01:40:44.794]  Well, no, yes he is, can I tell you?
[01:40:44.934 --> 01:40:45.894]  Just back off right now!
[01:40:46.354 --> 01:40:47.035]  Back off right now!
[01:40:47.535 --> 01:40:50.175]  Hey, Bush is... I go, hey, Bush is in bed with the Saudis.
[01:40:50.235 --> 01:40:53.736]  I have pictures of him out there last week with the Saudis, holding hands with them.
[01:40:53.976 --> 01:40:55.637]  He's in business with them, shelling us out.
[01:40:56.037 --> 01:41:02.358]  You're a liar, boy, you better bleepin' back off right now, or I'm gonna whoop your hind!
[01:41:02.378 --> 01:41:04.439]  And they said it another way.
[01:41:04.759 --> 01:41:05.499]  Started buckin' up.
[01:41:08.328 --> 01:41:12.191]  And insert some weird stuff like, like, George Bush is like our daddy.
[01:41:12.211 --> 01:41:14.713]  I remember when Democrats used to go, it's like Bill Clinton's our father.
[01:41:14.993 --> 01:41:16.114]  Don't question our father.
[01:41:16.154 --> 01:41:16.414]  He knows.
[01:41:16.474 --> 01:41:22.818]  It's the same weird psychology with these weirdos that Bush is flushing their future down the commode, and they're just going.
[01:41:23.219 --> 01:41:27.261]  I actually have multiple people on tape going, he's like our daddy.
[01:41:27.622 --> 01:41:29.763]  You don't talk about our daddy.
[01:41:30.223 --> 01:41:30.604]  I mean, it.
[01:41:32.097 --> 01:41:32.538]  It is.
[01:41:32.678 --> 01:41:34.180]  It is slave mentality.
[01:41:34.681 --> 01:41:35.622]  You don't talk about it.
[01:41:35.642 --> 01:41:36.703]  He's like our father.
[01:41:36.743 --> 01:41:38.706]  He doesn't need to tell us what's going on.
[01:41:38.746 --> 01:41:39.988]  We don't have a right to know.
[01:41:40.068 --> 01:41:41.089]  He knows best.
[01:41:42.451 --> 01:41:42.752]  What?
[01:41:43.212 --> 01:41:45.756]  He knows... I mean, just what happened to you people?
[01:41:46.697 --> 01:41:48.079]  Back off right now, buddy.
[01:41:48.940 --> 01:41:52.222]  I mean, they make these weird noises.
[01:41:52.242 --> 01:41:52.902]  You think I'm joking?
[01:41:52.942 --> 01:41:53.862]  I have them all on tape.
[01:41:54.043 --> 01:42:03.207]  When I do those imitations, that's real people who would love to see us turn in our guns, who would love to see us go to camps, who would love to have martial law and just worship the government.
[01:42:03.507 --> 01:42:04.247]  Because you know why?
[01:42:04.287 --> 01:42:05.288]  Deep down, they're afraid.
[01:42:05.308 --> 01:42:06.608]  They know everything we're saying is true.
[01:42:06.909 --> 01:42:08.049]  And deep down, they're scared.
[01:42:08.089 --> 01:42:12.031]  And cowards, most cowards are so cowardly, they won't even admit to themselves what they're doing.
[01:42:12.271 --> 01:42:13.752]  They'll just say, no, it ain't true.
[01:42:14.512 --> 01:42:16.354]  I love the government, because they're afraid.
[01:42:16.394 --> 01:42:17.795]  They just decide, I just like it.
[01:42:18.055 --> 01:42:20.017]  Well, then if there are going to be camps, good.
[01:42:20.037 --> 01:42:29.605]  I've had friends that, a guy who did my TV show when I first started it almost 12 years ago, now won't even talk to me in the halls of the TV station.
[01:42:29.645 --> 01:42:31.247]  You heard him here as a guest a few years ago.
[01:42:32.154 --> 01:42:48.449]  He walks up to me and got in my face, bowled up to me in front of two witnesses, Mike Hanson and Malcolm, a couple of weeks ago, this was about a month ago now, bowled up, bumped his eyes out and said, you're a traitor, you're a closet Islamicist,
[01:42:48.829 --> 01:42:51.010]  And yeah, you need to go to the camp.
[01:42:51.070 --> 01:42:53.450]  You need to be arrested for what you say.
[01:42:53.470 --> 01:42:57.171]  I have protested abortion clinics with this person.
[01:42:57.411 --> 01:42:58.792]  I have been to dinner with him.
[01:42:59.272 --> 01:43:00.692]  I was friends with his daughter.
[01:43:01.052 --> 01:43:02.573]  I'm friends with his son.
[01:43:02.993 --> 01:43:04.793]  I have been to church with these people.
[01:43:05.113 --> 01:43:10.475]  And eleven years later, he'd rather take this criminal cokehead, George Bush, over me.
[01:43:10.795 --> 01:43:12.615]  He'd rather believe the lie.
[01:43:12.695 --> 01:43:14.276]  By the way, George Bush is mad
[01:43:14.916 --> 01:43:19.843]  At one of these states now that is banning abortion, Bush wants to continue it.
[01:43:19.903 --> 01:43:20.163]  See?
[01:43:20.543 --> 01:43:21.184]  See now?
[01:43:21.525 --> 01:43:24.148]  Now it's conservative to be for abortion.
[01:43:24.208 --> 01:43:26.231]  You are the...just...ugh!
[01:43:26.791 --> 01:43:27.432]  What is wrong?
[01:43:27.452 --> 01:43:32.699]  I mean, people I know, folks, are going to be happy when they arrest me and when they torture me to death.
[01:43:32.719 --> 01:43:33.520]  They're going to love it.
[01:43:34.304 --> 01:43:35.524]  You understand that, folks?
[01:43:35.825 --> 01:43:37.285]  This is what we've turned into.
[01:43:37.365 --> 01:43:38.686]  This is what we've become.
[01:43:38.946 --> 01:43:40.346]  And I'm trying to avert this.
[01:43:40.366 --> 01:43:41.087]  Do you understand?
[01:43:41.267 --> 01:43:50.790]  And when that fool has his pension fund taken, when that fool has his army retirement taken, when people like that are abused by this government, they'll make excuses for the government.
[01:43:54.631 --> 01:43:55.992]  I've gone into a rant and I'm sorry.
[01:43:57.359 --> 01:43:59.059]  I've tried to lovingly talk to these people.
[01:43:59.119 --> 01:44:02.700]  I've tried to explain it to them, and they just get so afraid when you're talking to them.
[01:44:03.240 --> 01:44:04.521]  And they get violent.
[01:44:05.681 --> 01:44:07.861]  Because they are wedded to this government.
[01:44:07.881 --> 01:44:09.102]  They worship this government.
[01:44:09.382 --> 01:44:12.102]  No gods before me, it says in Leviticus.
[01:44:13.143 --> 01:44:14.003]  And what is a god?
[01:44:14.043 --> 01:44:14.983]  It's what you worship.
[01:44:15.023 --> 01:44:18.984]  If baseball is more important than God and your family to you, your idol is baseball.
[01:44:19.787 --> 01:44:27.854]  If having a fancy car, you know, your kids are on drugs and flunking school, but don't worry, you're out there waxing your stupid car!
[01:44:30.566 --> 01:44:33.308]  People ask me, why don't you clean your car on the outside?
[01:44:33.328 --> 01:44:34.389]  Because I don't care.
[01:44:34.449 --> 01:44:35.910]  It's to get me from one place to another.
[01:44:35.930 --> 01:44:37.692]  Well, why is it a pretty nice car?
[01:44:37.892 --> 01:44:39.313]  Because it's reliable.
[01:44:39.794 --> 01:44:42.316]  Because all I need is reliable transportation.
[01:44:42.536 --> 01:44:43.737]  But I don't care about it.
[01:44:44.177 --> 01:44:44.457]  Okay?
[01:44:44.477 --> 01:44:45.358]  I don't get off on it.
[01:44:45.378 --> 01:44:46.319]  I don't want to be noticed.
[01:44:46.339 --> 01:44:47.960]  I don't want stupid status.
[01:44:48.300 --> 01:44:49.301]  I want love.
[01:44:49.401 --> 01:44:50.162]  I want beauty.
[01:44:50.242 --> 01:44:51.143]  I want goodness.
[01:44:51.403 --> 01:44:52.624]  I love decency.
[01:44:52.844 --> 01:44:53.765]  I love innocence.
[01:44:53.865 --> 01:44:54.806]  I love tenderness.
[01:44:55.066 --> 01:45:00.050]  I love beauty and honor and happiness and goodliness.
[01:45:00.470 --> 01:45:04.391]  I can't stand petulant, worm-ridden evil.
[01:45:04.731 --> 01:45:09.273]  I am ashamed, I am upset of the things our government's doing overseas.
[01:45:09.613 --> 01:45:18.836]  I am freaked out by the fact that it could be in the Chicago Tribune that Halliburton's got lobbyists in Washington to keep the government from enforcing on them with white slaverings.
[01:45:19.236 --> 01:45:19.656]  Openly!
[01:45:19.956 --> 01:45:21.817]  I mean, it just freaks me out!
[01:45:25.098 --> 01:45:28.619]  And the very same people that run the camps overseas that are doing this
[01:45:29.747 --> 01:45:36.396]  From Bosnia to Iraq, the very same people are the ones now building the camps in America and expanding Guantanamo radically in Cuba.
[01:45:36.836 --> 01:45:46.569]  They're the same ones now with the declassified subsections, a synopsis has been declassified of this new program called
[01:45:47.481 --> 01:45:49.082]  Code named End Game.
[01:45:49.582 --> 01:45:54.864]  I mean, I'm here with the articles in front of me with Project End Game.
[01:45:55.284 --> 01:45:56.804]  I'm here looking at it.
[01:45:57.184 --> 01:45:59.125]  I'm here with it in front of me.
[01:45:59.265 --> 01:46:02.646]  I'm here with Army Regulation 210-35.
[01:46:03.106 --> 01:46:04.867]  Just, just cops driving along your car right now.
[01:46:04.887 --> 01:46:05.567]  You don't believe this.
[01:46:06.347 --> 01:46:07.568]  Just write down your little pad.
[01:46:08.028 --> 01:46:08.888]  Army Regulation 210-35.
[01:46:12.396 --> 01:46:14.298]  Or Civilian Inmate Labor Program.
[01:46:14.598 --> 01:46:15.398]  Just type that in.
[01:46:15.779 --> 01:46:17.180]  And type it in and go read it.
[01:46:17.220 --> 01:46:18.801]  Don't shoot your mouth off to me.
[01:46:19.522 --> 01:46:20.402]  You understand?
[01:46:20.963 --> 01:46:23.485]  Don't sit there and say this isn't true when it is.
[01:46:24.365 --> 01:46:25.946]  Again, you're an expert on baseball.
[01:46:25.987 --> 01:46:26.947]  You think that's important.
[01:46:26.987 --> 01:46:27.848]  So you know all about it.
[01:46:27.888 --> 01:46:29.109]  Well, I know all about this.
[01:46:29.549 --> 01:46:30.630]  And let me just tell you something.
[01:46:30.670 --> 01:46:33.792]  You better become an expert on the real world real fast.
[01:46:36.695 --> 01:46:38.216]  And I have all these articles here.
[01:46:38.812 --> 01:46:47.997]  Where they admit that this is going on, where they admit that this is happening here in this country that I love so much.
[01:46:48.517 --> 01:46:51.179]  Let's go to calls, so we don't get more into the camps with Paul when he joins us.
[01:46:51.199 --> 01:46:53.460]  I'm just too angry to cogently even go over it.
[01:46:54.621 --> 01:46:56.582]  Let's go ahead and talk to Joe in Pennsylvania.
[01:46:56.642 --> 01:46:57.282]  Joe, go ahead.
[01:46:57.302 --> 01:46:59.183]  Hey Alex, how you doing buddy?
[01:46:59.383 --> 01:46:59.884]  Fired up!
[01:47:00.244 --> 01:47:03.225]  You are, you're a hoot.
[01:47:03.405 --> 01:47:03.826]  I'm really
[01:47:05.296 --> 01:47:10.557]  I'm really behind the eight ball when it comes to the stuff that you cover, but I'm trying to catch up as quick as I can.
[01:47:11.437 --> 01:47:14.198]  And I'm reading the Wall Street Journal yesterday.
[01:47:14.218 --> 01:47:14.258]  U.S.
[01:47:15.158 --> 01:47:21.679]  water utility is purchased for $860 million by a company I think is called Macquarie.
[01:47:22.079 --> 01:47:23.239]  They're Australian.
[01:47:24.819 --> 01:47:30.000]  And the sale affects the water distribution and related services to about 700,000 people.
[01:47:30.160 --> 01:47:31.721]  Let me explain how this works.
[01:47:31.821 --> 01:47:33.381]  We pay taxes to build it.
[01:47:34.065 --> 01:47:40.306]  And then, for pennies on the dollar, it is transferred as part of us being bankrupt, as part of a debt agreement.
[01:47:40.566 --> 01:47:43.507]  The majority owner of water districts are the Dutch and the Germans.
[01:47:43.787 --> 01:47:47.067]  The majority of our infrastructure is now owned by foreigners.
[01:47:47.087 --> 01:47:49.568]  Okay, now listen to this.
[01:47:50.128 --> 01:47:56.049]  It affects 700,000 people in 52 communities, Connecticut, New York, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire.
[01:47:56.449 --> 01:48:00.290]  Now the thing is that it's a British company selling it to the Aussies.
[01:48:02.902 --> 01:48:09.285]  I'm wondering if there's a British bailout of infrastructure in this country?
[01:48:10.225 --> 01:48:19.110]  You know, I was going to say that last week, but I can't confirm it, but the trend looks like there is a partial British dumping of infrastructure.
[01:48:19.350 --> 01:48:29.095]  Now, my question is, to the people who are interested, is there any public source of information about who owns what in this country?
[01:48:29.115 --> 01:48:31.416]  I mean, is this a UAE deal?
[01:48:32.096 --> 01:48:33.999]  Basically a drop in the bucket?
[01:48:34.099 --> 01:48:35.161]  It's not even a drop.
[01:48:36.363 --> 01:48:38.767]  It's not even mist in the bucket.
[01:48:39.749 --> 01:48:41.913]  It's a particular... you have to look at it with a microscope.
[01:48:42.153 --> 01:48:46.180]  So, without researching every... Sir, sir, they're openly giving...
[01:48:47.029 --> 01:48:48.511]  Eighty percent plus.
[01:48:48.531 --> 01:48:51.394]  Eighty-two percent of the roads in Texas to a foreign Spanish company.
[01:48:51.634 --> 01:48:57.940]  And in the local newspaper, The Chronicle, writes an article saying it's a lie when it's been all over the statesman and admitted that it's Spanish-owned.
[01:48:57.980 --> 01:49:01.724]  I mean, it's just... Well, another question I got for you.
[01:49:01.804 --> 01:49:04.467]  Are these paybacks for being a part of the coalition?
[01:49:06.531 --> 01:49:07.472]  It's more than that, sir.
[01:49:07.492 --> 01:49:11.235]  When you find out they're not even really paying for it... Let me break this down.
[01:49:11.735 --> 01:49:15.458]  They come in with... I mean, the Spanish were a part of the coalition.
[01:49:15.478 --> 01:49:18.421]  The British... The Australians were a part of the coalition.
[01:49:19.241 --> 01:49:22.724]  Our votes were in the UAE's port.
[01:49:23.025 --> 01:49:25.166]  It's not a payoff for the coalition.
[01:49:25.647 --> 01:49:26.667]  It is the coalition.
[01:49:27.128 --> 01:49:28.329]  It's all owned by the same people, sir.
[01:49:28.389 --> 01:49:29.710]  I'll tell you real quick.
[01:49:30.310 --> 01:49:31.892]  Some votes are the incumbents.
[01:49:32.132 --> 01:49:33.333]  We gotta break the grip.
[01:49:34.088 --> 01:49:34.509]  I hear you.
[01:49:34.529 --> 01:49:35.069]  Thanks for the call.
[01:49:35.830 --> 01:49:39.114]  We'll come back and David just hung up so we'll talk to Don, John, Elias and others.
[01:49:39.794 --> 01:49:40.575]  This isn't a joke.
[01:49:40.615 --> 01:49:41.336]  It isn't a game.
[01:49:41.376 --> 01:49:42.157]  It isn't a drill.
[01:49:45.521 --> 01:49:49.125]  I mean, if you're mad about the ports, folks, then your head would explode if you knew what I knew.
[01:49:49.365 --> 01:49:49.946]  We'll be right back.
[01:49:54.631 --> 01:49:57.473]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.

[01:53:54.745 --> 01:53:56.686]  We're launching today, just for this month.
[01:53:56.706 --> 01:53:59.827]  We did it back during December, people loved it, so we're launching it again for one more month.
[01:54:00.427 --> 01:54:03.749]  Five plus months free when you get a yearly subscription.
[01:54:03.769 --> 01:54:10.431]  But remember, your subscription also supports what we're doing and makes feature films and future films, all the things we're doing.
[01:54:10.871 --> 01:54:11.392]  Possibly.
[01:54:11.412 --> 01:54:14.937]  We're expanding, we're doing better, but we need your support.
[01:54:14.957 --> 01:54:22.006]  So go to InfoWars.com to order hardcopy DVD or VHS or t-shirts or bumper stickers or books on tape and other books and videos.

[01:54:27.032 --> 01:54:36.295]  Now that we now have online at InfoWars.com from Codex Magicka to 9-11 Synthetic Terror to Jim Tucker's Bilderberg Diary, an amazing book.

[01:54:45.058 --> 01:54:45.118]  1-888-253-9111.
[01:54:48.899 --> 01:54:49.859]  3-1-3-9-8-8-8-2-5-3-3-1-3-9.
[01:54:49.879 --> 01:54:57.501]  Expose the terrorists, get involved in the fight today.
[01:54:58.401 --> 01:55:03.142]  Let's go ahead and talk to Don and Casey, then John Elias, Paul, Rodney, and others.
[01:55:03.182 --> 01:55:03.742]  Go ahead, Don.
[01:55:03.762 --> 01:55:12.624]  Yeah, Alex, this Dubai sports field seems to me to be a really winnable battle and a very important one, I would think.
[01:55:13.447 --> 01:55:16.868]  Because the average American is really waking up to this.
[01:55:16.908 --> 01:55:18.148]  I mean, they're scratching their heads.
[01:55:18.228 --> 01:55:23.309]  Well, that's because we've been told the Arabs are all going to kill us and want to slaughter us any minute, which of course isn't true.
[01:55:23.789 --> 01:55:26.550]  But, see, it doesn't fit into the propaganda.
[01:55:26.650 --> 01:55:28.410]  Now we learn Bush is in business with them.
[01:55:28.670 --> 01:55:29.750]  Payoffs are involved.
[01:55:29.790 --> 01:55:31.851]  They violated the 45-day law.
[01:55:31.871 --> 01:55:32.631]  I mean, they're criminals.
[01:55:32.651 --> 01:55:33.811]  They all need to be arrested right now.
[01:55:34.191 --> 01:55:36.532]  They're very vulnerable on this thing.
[01:55:37.633 --> 01:55:43.696]  And they have to resort to the worst lies, like they won't be handling port security and all this stuff.
[01:55:43.736 --> 01:55:45.478]  No, they'll just run all the security in the whole country.
[01:55:45.678 --> 01:55:46.458]  Oh yeah, absolutely.
[01:55:46.478 --> 01:55:47.539]  I mean, this is incredible!
[01:55:47.759 --> 01:56:01.228]  And the last four years, they've not been able to obviously pull off another terrorist attack, so this UAE thing might be a kind of end run around that by having the CIA laden country
[01:56:01.653 --> 01:56:06.355]  They go over these ports because they're not getting any cooperation from their minions on the local, state, and federal level.
[01:56:06.375 --> 01:56:06.935]  Well, I agree.
[01:56:06.955 --> 01:56:07.996]  And here's another facet.
[01:56:08.056 --> 01:56:15.439]  Back when they were getting these six major ports, and then two others, Corpus Christi and Beaumont, I looked at the numbers, that would be over half of these water ports.
[01:56:15.859 --> 01:56:17.480]  Now they're getting 21 plus.
[01:56:17.500 --> 01:56:19.020]  Now they're saying they're about to mount some more.
[01:56:19.541 --> 01:56:21.341]  That shows, number one, how much the British already own.
[01:56:21.401 --> 01:56:22.142]  It was already shown.
[01:56:22.382 --> 01:56:30.025]  But it shows that they are going to have the vast majority, not just half, but the vast majority, to be able to affect a monopoly.
[01:56:30.578 --> 01:56:35.764]  Well, you know, it's really almost impossible to get on these national neocon talk shows and talk about this.
[01:56:36.264 --> 01:56:40.589]  And locally, at least here in Kansas City, I mean, the hosts will not take up this issue.
[01:56:40.989 --> 01:56:43.432]  They take on these ridiculous, local, trivial things.
[01:56:44.011 --> 01:56:49.257]  I think they don't want to talk about it, but if we can get through to some of these shows, this would be the perfect opportunity to educate the public.
[01:56:49.277 --> 01:56:55.463]  Well, what you do is you get through to those shows and you go, hey, KCXL, for now six, seven years, has been carrying Alex Jones.
[01:56:55.503 --> 01:56:56.044]  Pick him up.
[01:56:56.564 --> 01:56:57.706]  Yeah, that's true.
[01:56:57.746 --> 01:56:59.868]  And by pick him up, I mean tune into KCXL.
[01:56:59.948 --> 01:57:01.089]  Listen to us there.
[01:57:01.109 --> 01:57:01.790]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:57:01.810 --> 01:57:03.992]  I mean, you've got a station that covers the whole city.
[01:57:04.132 --> 01:57:04.393]  Use it.
[01:57:04.953 --> 01:57:05.394]  Absolutely.
[01:57:07.353 --> 01:57:08.394]  Keep on ranting, brother.
[01:57:08.434 --> 01:57:11.895]  I really love it, because you're all fired up with righteous indignation, as far as I'm concerned.
[01:57:11.935 --> 01:57:13.035]  No, man, my life's in danger.
[01:57:13.075 --> 01:57:13.955]  Yours is, too, Bubba.
[01:57:13.975 --> 01:57:14.495]  Absolutely.
[01:57:14.656 --> 01:57:15.396]  This isn't a joke.
[01:57:15.416 --> 01:57:17.056]  I mean, they say they're going to take us down.
[01:57:17.316 --> 01:57:18.217]  This country's gone.
[01:57:18.357 --> 01:57:19.397]  We're going to be slaves.
[01:57:19.417 --> 01:57:20.377]  We're going to be third world.
[01:57:20.637 --> 01:57:20.837]  Absolutely.
[01:57:20.857 --> 01:57:22.578]  That's why they're selling off the infrastructure.
[01:57:22.998 --> 01:57:23.518]  Absolutely.
[01:57:24.238 --> 01:57:24.979]  Thanks for the call.
[01:57:25.039 --> 01:57:27.319]  I mean, I'm not trying to put a bad face on it, folks.
[01:57:27.339 --> 01:57:28.220]  The house is on fire.
[01:57:28.260 --> 01:57:29.800]  We've got to put it out.
[01:57:29.860 --> 01:57:30.340]  Come on.
[01:57:30.721 --> 01:57:31.221]  Be right back.
[01:57:33.098 --> 01:57:37.745]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll free 877-376-45.
[01:57:49.418 --> 01:57:53.580]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:57:54.240 --> 01:57:55.060]  You want answers?
[01:57:55.820 --> 01:57:56.741]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:56.761 --> 01:58:01.082]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:01.563 --> 01:58:05.684]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:06.625 --> 01:58:13.187]  Alright, at this hour, we'll get into all the official moves to tax and regulate free speech on the Internet.
[01:58:14.287 --> 01:58:15.548]  Taxation on the Net, here it is.
[01:58:16.471 --> 01:58:17.952]  Uh, Total Police State News.
[01:58:18.092 --> 01:58:19.273]  We'll get more into the camps.
[01:58:19.333 --> 01:58:20.394]  Just in your face.
[01:58:20.914 --> 01:58:24.737]  And we now know the name of the current, uh, Homeland Security plan.
[01:58:24.777 --> 01:58:26.278]  It's called End Game.
[01:58:26.458 --> 01:58:27.499]  It's called The End Game.
[01:58:27.779 --> 01:58:28.179]  End Game.
[01:58:28.239 --> 01:58:29.280]  Operation End Game.
[01:58:30.183 --> 01:58:31.824]  And Paul Watson's riding shotgun with us.
[01:58:31.884 --> 01:58:39.229]  I know that John and Elias and Paul and Rodney have been holding for a while, so we'll go to you early in the next segment after Paul covers some of the news.
[01:58:39.549 --> 01:58:45.332]  Paul Watson, you have been a busy little beaver, updating the site two, three times a day, writing multiple articles a day.
[01:58:45.352 --> 01:58:46.793]  I've been working with you on those as well.
[01:58:47.494 --> 01:58:49.155]  And there is so much to cover.
[01:58:49.695 --> 01:58:52.637]  And now it's basically admitted the government killed Diana, just calmly.
[01:58:52.657 --> 01:58:53.518]  We'll talk about that.
[01:58:53.538 --> 01:58:54.578]  There's so much going on.
[01:58:54.838 --> 01:58:55.919]  Thanks for coming on with us, Paul.
[01:58:56.419 --> 01:58:57.320]  Good to be back, Alex.
[01:58:58.248 --> 01:59:07.235]  The camp situation, you're facing similar legislation that's passed there of the civilian internment facilities, the Resident Relocation Centers as they're called in your news.
[01:59:07.635 --> 01:59:09.236]  Let's get into the camps right now.
[01:59:10.637 --> 01:59:26.689]  Well yeah, we have a situation whereby the President has declared himself to be a dictator, his cabinet have written memos saying that he's above the law, and his advisors are debating the legality of torturing children in front of their parents.
[01:59:27.799 --> 01:59:49.978]  So, as if that wasn't totalitarian enough, a company that's being engaged in, and actually lobbies for, the continuance of human trafficking and sex slaves, little girls and women, Halliburton and their subsidiary, Brown and Root, have been given a contract to build camps in America.
[01:59:51.339 --> 01:59:56.143]  And the parallel with Britain, as you mentioned, is interesting because in America,
[01:59:56.835 --> 02:00:14.751]  It was in the Washington Post that 325,000 are on the terrorist watch list, but they assured us that only a tiny fraction are American citizens, which I don't buy that for a second because the UK government admitted that it had 119,000 people
[02:00:17.748 --> 02:00:29.133]  UK citizens in the terror database under section 44 of the Terrorism Act, which basically is a stop and search procedure which is being... And I was put in that.
[02:00:29.173 --> 02:00:32.054]  You were there and witnessed me being given the paperwork and put into the system.
[02:00:33.034 --> 02:00:35.676]  Yeah, they ask for your address, your details, your name.
[02:00:35.696 --> 02:00:37.896]  That's a free society.
[02:00:37.936 --> 02:00:41.958]  Secret police coming up to a camera crew and then saying you're being put in the terror database.
[02:00:42.198 --> 02:00:42.979]  It's a free society.
[02:00:42.999 --> 02:00:45.780]  It's good to have secret agents and police milling around.
[02:00:45.820 --> 02:00:46.220]  That's freedom.
[02:00:47.031 --> 02:00:52.353]  Yeah, for the crime of filming some floral tributes outside of a tube station.
[02:00:54.194 --> 02:01:00.716]  But I mean, that's a conservative figure, £119,000, because it was taken before the London bombings.
[02:01:01.334 --> 02:01:03.576]  When they outrightly started doing it to everybody.
[02:01:03.776 --> 02:01:04.917]  Well, here's the analogy.
[02:01:05.077 --> 02:01:19.169]  If the Bush administration was, say, a dictatorship dog show, you know, they were looking for the pure breeds, all the markings, all the stature of a pure, dark, bloody, ruthless tyranny, they would win the show.
[02:01:19.269 --> 02:01:24.734]  I mean, what they're setting up is the most gleaming, glistening, blistered with weapon systems,
[02:01:25.214 --> 02:01:27.976]  All over it, and openly announcing pure evil.
[02:01:28.196 --> 02:01:32.039]  I mean, the Nazis didn't get up and say, we torture children in front of their parents to death.
[02:01:32.940 --> 02:01:35.122]  I mean, we've hit new levels here, folks.
[02:01:35.922 --> 02:01:38.904]  No, the Nazis didn't come out and glorify it.
[02:01:39.485 --> 02:01:46.550]  What they did do parallels directly with the database society that's been initiated in the US and the UK.
[02:01:47.130 --> 02:01:51.774]  Because, obviously, the Nazis with their international business machines, IBM,
[02:01:52.475 --> 02:01:55.677]  Um, which were early generation punch card system computers.
[02:01:56.438 --> 02:01:59.700]  Um, group by group, they catalogued them in the database.
[02:01:59.780 --> 02:02:11.687]  First it was homosexuals and gypsies, then it was political enemies, then it was, um, wealthy Jews from Eastern Europe, then wealthy German Jews, and then, you know, people of half-Jewish descent.
[02:02:12.508 --> 02:02:17.931]  Um, so they catalogued them all in the database using the IBM machines, and then the roundups began.
[02:02:18.669 --> 02:02:23.733]  So they do it in controlled ways so as not to, you know, stir reaction from the remaining citizens.
[02:02:25.314 --> 02:02:25.834]  That's right.
[02:02:25.894 --> 02:02:26.755]  Much more of this.
[02:02:27.115 --> 02:02:29.617]  And, uh, well, take the gloves off, folks.
[02:02:30.497 --> 02:02:32.919]  And we're trying to stop what they're doing.
[02:02:32.959 --> 02:02:34.460]  We're trying to expose what's happening.
[02:02:35.060 --> 02:02:36.661]  We cannot go quietly into the night.
[02:02:36.701 --> 02:02:40.424]  We cannot let them stomp our children's brains out right in front of us.
[02:02:40.864 --> 02:02:41.465]  We'll be right back.
[02:02:41.505 --> 02:02:41.865]  Stay with us.
[02:02:46.829 --> 02:02:47.850]  The War on Terrorism.
[02:02:48.191 --> 02:02:50.974]  Will it be fought overseas, or will it affect us here at home?
[02:02:51.234 --> 02:02:55.399]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[02:02:55.820 --> 02:02:56.661]  So what do you do?
[02:02:56.961 --> 02:03:01.547]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[02:03:02.031 --> 02:03:04.132]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.

[02:03:44.989 --> 02:03:46.490]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:03:46.650 --> 02:03:49.751]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[02:03:49.871 --> 02:03:53.772]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[02:03:53.832 --> 02:03:58.054]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[02:03:58.394 --> 02:04:02.175]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[02:04:02.315 --> 02:04:04.176]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[02:04:04.316 --> 02:04:07.617]  Riot police attacked people on the street indiscriminately.
[02:04:07.657 --> 02:04:08.758]  The medical bills!
[02:04:09.598 --> 02:04:12.399]  Are going to be enormous for me.
[02:04:12.539 --> 02:04:15.580]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[02:04:15.760 --> 02:04:18.641]  They are being let into the Sandpoint Brig.
[02:04:19.101 --> 02:04:25.223]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[02:04:25.743 --> 02:04:29.546]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.

[02:04:44.275 --> 02:04:45.776]  Hey folks, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:04:46.116 --> 02:04:50.059]  You've all heard me on the radio talking about the importance of investing in precious metals.
[02:04:50.439 --> 02:04:53.961]  I feel it's time for me to talk about the importance of investing in your health.
[02:04:54.341 --> 02:04:57.904]  I was presented with the opportunity to try TriVibes from TriVortex.
[02:04:58.284 --> 02:05:03.187]  I was a bit hesitant of the idea of absorbing vitamins by wearing them rather than ingesting them.
[02:05:03.487 --> 02:05:09.231]  After conducting one of the tests found at TriVortex.com, I was convinced that the product might actually work.
[02:05:09.571 --> 02:05:13.294]  I now wear my Tri-Vibes bands daily, and I'm feeling better than ever.
[02:05:13.634 --> 02:05:15.736]  Not only physically, but also mentally.
[02:05:16.056 --> 02:05:21.860]  Tri-Vortex also offers amazingly beneficial and beautiful jewelry worn by the women around the office daily.
[02:05:22.260 --> 02:05:23.461]  Tri-Vortex is amazing.
[02:05:23.781 --> 02:05:24.882]  Don't take my word for it.
[02:05:24.982 --> 02:05:30.386]  Try Tri-Vortex yourself and have fun and learn with the tests found on TriVortex.com.
[02:05:30.586 --> 02:05:33.969]  That's T-R-I-V-O-R-T-E-X dot com.
[02:05:34.309 --> 02:05:35.730]  Or call my friend Brian at 619-884-1455.
[02:05:35.770 --> 02:05:35.990]  That's 619-884-1455.
[02:05:36.010 --> 02:05:36.971]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:05:37.171 --> 02:05:39.012]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:01.878 --> 02:06:14.404]  Portions of a Homeland Security plan titled, well we'll get into it in a minute with Paul, I mean the name is so chilling itself in game, are now public.
[02:06:14.444 --> 02:06:20.007]  It's in major newspapers, at camps for the American citizens, and in a certain level it's an attempt at intimidation.
[02:06:20.939 --> 02:06:27.929]  General Shoemaker, who ran the Operation Killing the Women and Children, and that's now been declassified, at Waco, the Delta Force, doing the wet work.
[02:06:27.949 --> 02:06:31.394]  He was on site.
[02:06:31.675 --> 02:06:37.223]  He's a fellow running the Civilian Inmate Labor Camp Program, with American citizens in camps right now, but they're just prisoners.
[02:06:37.643 --> 02:06:40.585]  from federal and now state prisons, and they're going to expand that all over the country.
[02:06:40.905 --> 02:06:43.386]  So there's lots of these, and it's all in plain view.
[02:06:43.406 --> 02:06:46.107]  They don't call them camps, they call them emergency centers.
[02:06:46.147 --> 02:06:51.450]  And we have the Chairman of the Senate Committee, with Alberto Gonzales, saying we need to start arresting these war protesters.
[02:06:51.770 --> 02:06:52.991]  They're really fifth columnists.
[02:06:53.031 --> 02:07:04.796]  And I remember when the Deputy Attorney General in California, three and a half years ago, was in the Oakland Tribune, said, we're going to arrest all war protesters, peaceful ones.
[02:07:04.816 --> 02:07:05.957]  This was on the eve of the Gulf War.
[02:07:07.170 --> 02:07:10.953]  He said we're going to arrest them all because by protesting the war, they aid terrorists.
[02:07:11.334 --> 02:07:12.154]  Paul, continue.
[02:07:12.174 --> 02:07:17.859]  We have Hamilton that runs the white slave trade in Europe, openly in the mainstream news, lobbyists in DC.
[02:07:18.139 --> 02:07:21.602]  We have the White House counsels like you and now Attorney General
[02:07:22.563 --> 02:07:26.086]  Alberto Gonzales saying they're above the law, they can torture children in front of their parents.
[02:07:26.346 --> 02:07:30.149]  This is all official, trying to sell this evil right out in front of everyone.
[02:07:30.489 --> 02:07:37.515]  Bush saying that he doesn't care if they pass laws, he'll just enforce it, that he is the law, and then saying it's because the Constitution says it.
[02:07:38.396 --> 02:07:42.999]  All of this going on, now admitting the surveillance is on everyone, trying to have a chilling effect.
[02:07:43.219 --> 02:07:45.321]  Do you think they're doing this, Paul, because they're getting desperate?
[02:07:45.361 --> 02:07:47.082]  They know that there's a paradigm shift happening?
[02:07:49.835 --> 02:07:51.335]  I'm split two ways on that.
[02:07:51.355 --> 02:07:59.258]  I'm kind of discouraged by the fact that one in a thousand Americans know what the First Amendment is and what freedoms it upholds.
[02:07:59.638 --> 02:08:00.878]  Oh yeah, that's a major new study.
[02:08:00.898 --> 02:08:01.698]  Tell folks about that.
[02:08:02.559 --> 02:08:04.179]  Yeah, we can get into that.
[02:08:04.999 --> 02:08:10.441]  One in a thousand Americans know every freedom that the First Amendment upholds.
[02:08:11.421 --> 02:08:16.143]  More Americans can name Simpsons characters than they can name those five freedoms.
[02:08:17.893 --> 02:08:21.075]  And it's really a benchmark for how much danger we're in.
[02:08:21.555 --> 02:08:26.918]  Because that kind of poll gives aid and comfort to the enemy, which is the globalists.
[02:08:27.038 --> 02:08:27.758]  Well, here it is.
[02:08:28.038 --> 02:08:29.259]  In fact, it's worse than that.
[02:08:29.659 --> 02:08:30.560]  They couldn't name two
[02:08:31.769 --> 02:08:36.091]  So, your previous question about, are they doing this because they're getting desperate?
[02:09:00.583 --> 02:09:07.186]  I mean, they read that kind of thing and it only enhances their zeal to dominate and enslave us for our own good.
[02:09:07.687 --> 02:09:13.530]  Because, you know, they've brainwashed themselves to believe that they have a divine right to dominate and rule stupid people.
[02:09:14.710 --> 02:09:24.795]  You can look at the flip side of it and say that that means 3 million Americans out of 295 plus million in the country know exactly what their rights are.
[02:09:25.075 --> 02:09:28.937]  You know, are they going to put 3 million informed Americans in concentration camps?
[02:09:30.899 --> 02:09:51.347]  It comes down to why this is happening, because basically the public school system, which from its very foundation, and we posted the documents on this a few weeks ago, the founders talk about psychologically moulding people to create these mindless drones and bricks in the wall of the system.
[02:09:52.162 --> 02:10:02.264]  Via the public school system, which is obviously based on learning monotonously by row, and the day being divided up by Pavlovian bells.
[02:10:02.724 --> 02:10:06.005]  They say in their own documents what they intend to do.
[02:10:06.985 --> 02:10:12.346]  Rockefeller Education Board, which funded the creation of public schools.
[02:10:12.546 --> 02:10:17.087]  He said, helpless people yielding themselves to our molding hands.
[02:10:17.805 --> 02:10:22.088]  Yeah, people yield themselves with perfect docility to our moulding hands.
[02:10:23.148 --> 02:10:36.276]  The present educational conventions, intellectual and character education, fade from our minds and unhampered by tradition we work our own good will upon a grateful and responsive folk.
[02:10:36.737 --> 02:10:42.240]  We shall not try to make these people or any of their children into philosophers or men of learning or men of science.
[02:10:42.800 --> 02:10:47.383]  We have not to raise up from among them authors, educators, poets or men of letters.
[02:10:48.166 --> 02:10:55.329]  It goes on and on, and it talks about the tough... So Americans have gone from the smartest... Sorry, Paul.
[02:10:55.649 --> 02:11:06.993]  Americans have gone from the smartest, wealthiest, most dynamic people in human history, and all the big authors worldwide marveled at the average intelligence, the learnedness, to the stupidest.
[02:11:07.153 --> 02:11:08.414]  I'm sorry, Paul, please continue.
[02:11:08.734 --> 02:11:13.456]  All scientifically done, and the Rockefellers officially call us dumb slaves, and laugh at us.
[02:11:13.476 --> 02:11:16.097]  Yeah, and I know exactly
[02:11:16.579 --> 02:11:22.481]  Now they do it because I went through a year of university and the only thing that I remembered at the end of it was how to do footnotes.
[02:11:22.781 --> 02:11:25.822]  So it's that regurgitating learning by rote.
[02:11:25.982 --> 02:11:27.902]  It's not a proper form of education.
[02:11:28.682 --> 02:11:29.803]  You don't even remember it.
[02:11:29.823 --> 02:11:31.463]  It's designed to make you forget it.
[02:11:33.063 --> 02:11:44.407]  And popular culture is another contributing factor to this First Amendment story because it's packaged in something far more fancier than a 230 year old piece of paper.
[02:11:46.604 --> 02:12:03.076]  So whereas you're supposed to, you know, dip your toe in popular culture, which is how it's supposed to be and how it used to be, you use the example now of people can name the football scores from the past 50 years, but they don't know what the First Amendment is.
[02:12:03.516 --> 02:12:07.479]  And the fact is that they've increased the volume of popular culture and distractions 100%.
[02:12:09.840 --> 02:12:14.524]  So now there's so many distractions available to people that the result is they simply don't think.
[02:12:16.659 --> 02:12:27.566]  And so the entire country is going into receivership, openly being handed over to foreigners, and we're here desperately trying to warn people.
[02:12:27.586 --> 02:12:29.327]  I mean, Paul, I can't ever get over it.
[02:12:29.347 --> 02:12:30.728]  I keep repeating it to myself.
[02:12:30.748 --> 02:12:33.190]  I wake up in the middle of the night thinking about it.
[02:12:33.815 --> 02:12:39.299]  We have open evil people that admit they're torturing children to death in front of their parents.
[02:12:39.699 --> 02:12:40.960]  The Army Report admits this.
[02:12:40.980 --> 02:12:42.581]  They're grabbing innocent people everywhere.
[02:12:42.941 --> 02:12:48.886]  They have TV shows like 24 and 10 others promoting torturing people's children to save cities from nukes.
[02:12:49.386 --> 02:12:50.947]  You can see the seamless propaganda.
[02:12:50.967 --> 02:12:55.050]  They're actually right now warping us into these demonic creatures.
[02:12:55.470 --> 02:13:02.773]  I mean, I'm seeing this once great moral nation openly... Again, the Nazis didn't brag about torturing kids in public.
[02:13:03.093 --> 02:13:13.036]  They just did it secretly, and our government hired them as a cadre because they couldn't find enough evil people here, and they openly used them for the rocket systems at NASA, for the educational systems.
[02:13:13.056 --> 02:13:16.477]  They used them to found the CIA, doctrines of torture.
[02:13:16.497 --> 02:13:18.158]  I read the documents.
[02:13:18.238 --> 02:13:19.078]  That is confirmed.
[02:13:19.805 --> 02:13:40.577]  That Nazis set up our whole system because the evil people running our government knew they could have a cadre that would do it, then they trained the next generation of Americans and told them, oh, you've got to do all these evil things to fight Communists, when the globalists had actually funded them to begin with, as something to, you know, fight with, and then now we're multi-generations into this just going, yeah, we need to go ahead and torture small children, that's good!
[02:13:40.597 --> 02:13:48.702]  Well, yeah, that's, you know, Straussian ethic that they've imbued into people via the media.
[02:13:49.457 --> 02:13:53.959]  That we need to be dirtier than the enemy to save America.
[02:13:53.979 --> 02:13:56.520]  And they've done it very simply.
[02:13:56.540 --> 02:13:58.721]  They've boiled it down to a football analogy.
[02:13:58.781 --> 02:14:00.001]  It's us versus them.
[02:14:00.742 --> 02:14:02.703]  Like Bosch with Bin Laden.
[02:14:02.743 --> 02:14:04.403]  And then schizophrenically, exactly.
[02:14:04.423 --> 02:14:05.624]  Then it's schizophrenic, though.
[02:14:06.124 --> 02:14:08.725]  Oh, they're bad, they torture, and then there's not real evidence of that.
[02:14:08.785 --> 02:14:11.006]  But oh, when we torture, it's not torture, it's good.
[02:14:11.026 --> 02:14:13.307]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:14:13.914 --> 02:14:29.648]  So, I mean, it's warping people's mentality to accept it for the cause of the greater good, which is really what these neocons believe they're behind, which is how they can justify doing all this, because they think there's some part at the end of the rainbow.
[02:14:29.669 --> 02:14:32.972]  Well, they tell their minions that up high they're just evil, they love power.
[02:14:33.812 --> 02:14:35.454]  Well, yeah, right, at the top it's total evil.
[02:14:36.318 --> 02:14:38.239]  I want to get back into camps and take some calls, Paul.
[02:14:38.259 --> 02:14:41.000]  There's a bunch of other issues you're here joining us on today.
[02:14:41.300 --> 02:14:42.220]  But this 10-year U.S.
[02:14:42.300 --> 02:14:46.462]  Strategic Plan for Detention Camps revives proposals from Oliver North.
[02:14:47.242 --> 02:14:56.966]  Yesterday, we wrote an article about this, and a new one came out today, and they said, we're going to claim it's for illegal aliens, but it's really going to be for Americans, and if there's a big terror attack, we'll have martial law.
[02:14:56.986 --> 02:14:58.406]  Now that's the declassified plan.
[02:14:58.707 --> 02:15:02.288]  Now they're saying there's going to be a terror attack, it's for illegal aliens and for citizens,
[02:15:02.828 --> 02:15:04.288]  And we're going to build these all over the country.
[02:15:04.308 --> 02:15:06.469]  They already built the three one million man camps.
[02:15:07.149 --> 02:15:08.569]  It's all right there, Paul.
[02:15:08.649 --> 02:15:09.449]  It's all happening.
[02:15:10.569 --> 02:15:11.029]  That's right.
[02:15:11.090 --> 02:15:18.671]  Obviously, there's no reason to build camps unless you've already got a system in place to discriminate who you're going to put in those camps.
[02:15:19.111 --> 02:15:25.612]  With Rex 84, the FBI had already drawn up the list, the database of American citizens who they were planning to round up.
[02:15:26.132 --> 02:15:30.633]  They're in the process of doing that now with the terror watch list and all that kind of thing.
[02:15:31.258 --> 02:15:38.403]  Folks, if you're afraid to fight against this, if they try it, believe me, you better be afraid because of them getting you.
[02:15:38.503 --> 02:15:42.426]  Because once you're in their hands, they literally have hired the scum of the earth.
[02:15:42.486 --> 02:15:49.310]  I mean, these are the psychopaths, and it's just a feeding frenzy, and there's nothing you can do but defend yourself.
[02:15:50.691 --> 02:16:00.198]  That's right, but the question is, with the discrimination, will the RFID identification tags be a precursor to the camps?
[02:16:01.072 --> 02:16:11.876]  Because now you've got the American Academy of Forensic Science promoting implanted RFID chips to be put in your teeth to identify you.
[02:16:12.416 --> 02:16:18.658]  And the casual way they talk about it in the article which I posted today is frightening, like it's no big deal.
[02:16:19.398 --> 02:16:24.120]  So, will the tattoo on the arm of the concentration camp victim in the 1930s
[02:16:25.552 --> 02:16:29.313]  As insane as it sounds, we have Andy Rooney on tape saying everyone should be forced to take a chip.
[02:16:29.333 --> 02:16:31.513]  To prove, quote, you're a good person.
[02:16:32.034 --> 02:16:32.834]  And he wasn't joking.
[02:16:54.341 --> 02:16:56.381]  The ID cards are the precursor to that.
[02:16:56.942 --> 02:17:00.382]  In my country, especially, where they've tried to ram it through so many times.
[02:17:00.802 --> 02:17:03.943]  Well, we put out a detailed report on this and several others that others have written.
[02:17:04.023 --> 02:17:07.384]  I hope people will go get those at prisonplanet.com and get it out to everybody.
[02:17:07.404 --> 02:17:11.745]  Paul, we're going to come back from break and take some calls, but what are some of the other issues you want to cover?
[02:17:13.565 --> 02:17:22.627]  I think we need to talk about civil war in Iraq, because I've got some quotes from the Israeli blueprint for exactly what we see unfolding now, that it's by design.
[02:17:24.525 --> 02:17:25.566]  But that's their own documents.
[02:17:25.586 --> 02:17:26.587]  You know, we shouldn't believe that.
[02:17:26.607 --> 02:17:30.550]  We shouldn't go to their own admitted plan that they're following, because it's not true.
[02:17:30.630 --> 02:17:31.951]  You just don't like Israel.
[02:17:33.292 --> 02:17:37.114]  We'll cover that also more on the Mosque shrine bombing and your calls.
[02:17:37.134 --> 02:17:38.295]  Your calls are straight ahead.
[02:17:38.315 --> 02:17:38.676]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:17:38.756 --> 02:17:39.376]  Check out prisonplanet.tv.
[02:17:46.823 --> 02:17:51.324]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[02:17:51.684 --> 02:17:55.766]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[02:17:56.066 --> 02:17:56.606]  We listened.
[02:17:56.926 --> 02:18:01.907]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[02:18:02.167 --> 02:18:02.668]  We listened.
[02:18:03.048 --> 02:18:03.908]  You asked us to develop
[02:18:13.047 --> 02:18:18.008]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[02:18:18.428 --> 02:18:19.789]  Again, we listened.
[02:18:20.149 --> 02:18:27.531]  Introducing the Berkey Light, the gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.
[02:18:27.911 --> 02:18:32.232]  Get the Berkey Light, the American water filter, for only $259 by calling New Millennium
[02:18:36.785 --> 02:18:38.369]  That's toll free 888-803-4438.
[02:18:38.390 --> 02:18:39.573]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:18:45.419 --> 02:18:51.626]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[02:18:52.086 --> 02:18:59.874]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[02:19:00.215 --> 02:19:08.063]  Is this a flaw for the enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[02:19:08.383 --> 02:19:13.124]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[02:19:13.464 --> 02:19:18.165]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[02:19:18.685 --> 02:19:22.546]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[02:19:23.026 --> 02:19:24.046]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.

[02:20:50.287 --> 02:20:51.027]  You heard that right.
[02:20:51.108 --> 02:20:53.570]  You owe no debt on your bank-issued credit cards.

[02:21:59.650 --> 02:22:01.010]  That's their End Game.
[02:22:01.030 --> 02:22:02.050]  They just flaunt it.
[02:22:03.799 --> 02:22:06.981]  Paul Watson, let's take a few calls here and we'll get into all the subjects you mentioned.
[02:22:07.381 --> 02:22:09.522]  Let's go ahead and talk to John in Tennessee.
[02:22:09.542 --> 02:22:10.182]  Go ahead, John.
[02:22:10.842 --> 02:22:11.903]  Hi Alex and Paul.
[02:22:12.563 --> 02:22:12.843]  Hello.
[02:22:13.764 --> 02:22:21.307]  You mentioned the movie, Alex, V for Vendetta, which is about the gunpowder plot to bomb British Parliament.
[02:22:22.368 --> 02:22:31.472]  And it was scheduled for release last year on the 5th of November on the 400th anniversary, but the 7-7 bombings in London postponed the release until March.
[02:22:32.546 --> 02:22:40.310]  And the movie glorifies terrorist bombers like Constable Thomas Percy, who was gunned down while resisting arrest for the Gunpowder Plot.
[02:22:41.051 --> 02:22:42.872]  Well, sir, I don't even know what the movie's about.
[02:22:42.892 --> 02:22:46.394]  I just played the trailer, because it talks about a tyrannical government.
[02:22:47.054 --> 02:22:49.936]  And so I quoted something out of it, so I said, hey, it's from that.
[02:22:50.236 --> 02:22:54.919]  Well, the website, the official movie website, goes into the history of the Gunpowder Plot.
[02:22:55.819 --> 02:23:00.622]  And Percy is an ancestor of Barbara Pierce Bush, whose family name was changed from Percy.
[02:23:01.411 --> 02:23:05.834]  So the movie actually glorifies George Bush bombing USA on 9-1-1.
[02:23:07.956 --> 02:23:08.837]  Well, I didn't know that.
[02:23:08.857 --> 02:23:09.437]  That's interesting.
[02:23:09.457 --> 02:23:11.419]  John, I'd like you to send me some documentation on it.
[02:23:11.619 --> 02:23:11.959]  Yes, sir.
[02:23:11.979 --> 02:23:14.861]  It says on the website, huh, that it glorifies George Bush?
[02:23:15.302 --> 02:23:19.865]  Well, it says on the website it goes into all the history of the gunpowder plot 400 years ago.
[02:23:20.646 --> 02:23:22.908]  This is a modern version of the gunpowder plot.
[02:23:22.948 --> 02:23:29.573]  It's revenge for the gunpowder plot 400 years ago to blow up British Parliament with massive explosives.
[02:23:30.129 --> 02:23:30.990]  Really, I didn't know that.
[02:23:31.130 --> 02:23:31.871]  Anything else, sir?
[02:23:33.112 --> 02:23:35.674]  It's the Wachowski brothers who wrote the movie.
[02:23:35.694 --> 02:23:36.555]  They did The Matrix.
[02:23:37.276 --> 02:23:38.957]  They've always got massive funding.
[02:23:39.938 --> 02:23:42.020]  And they're multinational corporations.
[02:23:42.100 --> 02:23:43.041]  Okay, well thank you.
[02:23:43.081 --> 02:23:45.003]  I'm not really that concerned about the movie.
[02:23:45.023 --> 02:23:45.804]  Anything else on your mind?
[02:23:46.996 --> 02:23:52.258]  Uh, just how it applies to propaganda and modern history and ancient history.
[02:23:52.278 --> 02:23:52.798]  That's interesting.
[02:23:52.818 --> 02:23:55.219]  I'll have to see it now and check out what you're saying.
[02:23:55.259 --> 02:23:56.860]  Send me some, send me some info.
[02:23:56.880 --> 02:23:57.960]  Send me some documentation.
[02:23:58.261 --> 02:23:59.321]  I appreciate it.
[02:23:59.361 --> 02:24:00.361]  Any comments on that, Paul?
[02:24:01.902 --> 02:24:05.884]  Uh, I know there is an alternative history behind the gunpowder plot.
[02:24:06.364 --> 02:24:11.026]  I don't know it in any detail, but obviously there are different explanations behind it.
[02:24:12.086 --> 02:24:13.627]  Well, they claim it was staged.
[02:24:14.447 --> 02:24:14.587]  Yeah.
[02:24:15.942 --> 02:24:19.084]  They claim that it wasn't really the, quote, Catholics that were trying to blow it up.
[02:24:19.924 --> 02:24:21.185]  But, uh, who knows?
[02:24:21.705 --> 02:24:25.527]  Alright, let's go ahead and, uh, another globalist bombed Wall Street in 1920.
[02:24:25.647 --> 02:24:26.668]  Nobody even knows about that.
[02:24:26.688 --> 02:24:29.449]  Uh, let's go ahead and talk to Elias in Michigan.
[02:24:29.469 --> 02:24:30.370]  Elias, you're on the air.
[02:24:30.410 --> 02:24:30.730]  Welcome.
[02:24:31.030 --> 02:24:31.711]  Thank you very much.
[02:24:32.951 --> 02:24:35.312]  Give me a moment to gather my thoughts.
[02:24:35.633 --> 02:24:36.053]  Okay.
[02:24:36.333 --> 02:24:36.733]  Alright.
[02:24:36.753 --> 02:24:38.234]  Do you want me to put you on hold?
[02:24:38.254 --> 02:24:38.834]  No, no.
[02:24:38.994 --> 02:24:39.575]  That's quite alright.
[02:24:39.795 --> 02:24:40.615]  Okay, go ahead, sir.
[02:24:40.635 --> 02:24:41.176]  You're on air now.
[02:24:41.856 --> 02:24:44.177]  When, uh, I listen to you every day, of course.
[02:24:44.197 --> 02:24:45.318]  I have for years.
[02:24:46.386 --> 02:24:53.569]  And whenever you don't come on, like today, shortwave, you're going to hit me.
[02:24:53.589 --> 02:24:55.330]  What did you hear on the shortwave today, sir?
[02:24:56.170 --> 02:24:56.571]  Speak up!
[02:24:56.631 --> 02:24:58.912]  It sounds like your phone's real far away, or maybe my audio is low.
[02:24:58.932 --> 02:24:59.072]  Really?
[02:24:59.112 --> 02:24:59.752]  Oh, I don't know.
[02:25:00.512 --> 02:25:00.952]  Far away?
[02:25:01.073 --> 02:25:01.533]  I'm right here.
[02:25:01.973 --> 02:25:02.433]  Okay.
[02:25:03.374 --> 02:25:05.094]  It's a regular phone.
[02:25:05.374 --> 02:25:05.795]  All righty.
[02:25:06.295 --> 02:25:06.575]  All right.
[02:25:07.293 --> 02:25:07.493]  Yeah.
[02:25:07.733 --> 02:25:08.934]  So we're not on shortwave today?
[02:25:08.955 --> 02:25:10.236]  Well, no, you are.
[02:25:10.556 --> 02:25:16.341]  But it didn't come in right away, and so I call you, and they were surprised.
[02:25:16.361 --> 02:25:18.082]  They said, well, it's finally... Well, we don't run that.
[02:25:18.142 --> 02:25:18.743]  We don't run that.
[02:25:18.783 --> 02:25:19.383]  That's an issue.
[02:25:19.404 --> 02:25:19.884]  Yeah, I understand.
[02:25:19.904 --> 02:25:20.264]  I know.
[02:25:20.585 --> 02:25:23.787]  You know, it hits me that, has it occurred?
[02:25:24.568 --> 02:25:27.751]  Because the electronic media will be chopped off.
[02:25:27.771 --> 02:25:28.852]  You know what I mean?
[02:25:29.232 --> 02:25:30.193]  That'll be the first to go.
[02:25:31.334 --> 02:25:33.796]  But you came on, so then... Alright.
[02:25:35.012 --> 02:25:37.393]  Well, then I'll give you a call, you know?
[02:25:37.793 --> 02:25:39.953]  Well, I appreciate you giving us a heads up.
[02:25:40.754 --> 02:25:43.734]  You know, I lived through the Hitler era.
[02:25:45.115 --> 02:25:49.936]  And of course, my parents were working class, you know.
[02:25:50.036 --> 02:25:52.116]  You might say left-leaning or something.
[02:25:52.896 --> 02:25:54.337]  It may have rubbed off on me.
[02:25:55.797 --> 02:25:57.978]  Well, we don't believe in left and right paradigms, sir.
[02:25:57.998 --> 02:26:03.199]  But the analogy between Hitler and what's going on now, the puppet Hitler,
[02:26:04.176 --> 02:26:05.397]  It's not really complete.
[02:26:05.857 --> 02:26:16.486]  In Germany, there was vast opposition, organized, against the neo-cons, is essentially what they were.
[02:26:16.506 --> 02:26:18.968]  Not after 1934.
[02:26:19.008 --> 02:26:19.728]  I want to thank you for your call.
[02:26:19.748 --> 02:26:20.349]  We've got a lot of news.
[02:26:20.369 --> 02:26:20.929]  We need to move on.
[02:26:21.230 --> 02:26:23.812]  I sounded frustrated, so I couldn't really understand a lot of what you were saying.
[02:26:24.032 --> 02:26:24.872]  Maybe listeners could.
[02:26:24.892 --> 02:26:26.313]  Maybe the feed was bad to me or something.
[02:26:26.954 --> 02:26:29.896]  Paul, the caller brings up media control.
[02:26:29.916 --> 02:26:33.199]  They're openly coming out saying they want to regulate and tax and control the net.
[02:26:34.551 --> 02:26:43.814]  Well, you know who Donald Rumsfeld identified as a target for these camps with a speech to the Council on Foreign Relations?
[02:26:44.294 --> 02:26:45.934]  Quote, News Informers.
[02:26:46.574 --> 02:26:47.415]  Who do you think that is?
[02:26:48.735 --> 02:26:50.375]  He said News Informers.
[02:26:50.816 --> 02:26:51.056]  Yeah.
[02:26:51.096 --> 02:26:59.038]  He's given two speeches in front of TV cameras going, it's just terrible these news websites and our propaganda isn't working too well.
[02:26:59.478 --> 02:27:03.119]  But then George reports that Bush loves the alternative media.
[02:27:03.757 --> 02:27:10.582]  But he classifies himself as the alternative media when he's the most... You know, I've got that in the stack of news today, Paul.
[02:27:10.602 --> 02:27:11.263]  I want to comment on that.
[02:27:11.283 --> 02:27:12.283]  I'm just going to take a few more calls.
[02:27:12.343 --> 02:27:14.125]  I'm not mad at the callers.
[02:27:14.185 --> 02:27:17.007]  It's just that it's so all over the map, we're not even able to cover the news, really.
[02:27:17.027 --> 02:27:21.090]  So, we'll talk to Paul, Rodney, and David, and that's it, when we get back.
[02:27:21.150 --> 02:27:24.973]  And then, because I want Paul, who's here, to be able to have some time, be able to go over all of this.
[02:27:25.013 --> 02:27:25.673]  So, stay with us.
[02:27:26.014 --> 02:27:27.375]  We're glad you're riding shotgun.
[02:27:27.395 --> 02:27:27.855]  Stay with us.
[02:27:35.535 --> 02:27:38.536]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.436 --> 02:27:42.216]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:45.557 --> 02:27:47.177]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.

[02:29:10.937 --> 02:29:12.577]  1-800-373-0402.
[02:29:15.299 --> 02:29:22.202]  When my son started having behavior problems, the total transformation techniques were like the instruction manual on how to deal with him.
[02:29:22.442 --> 02:29:23.723]  We got immediate results.
[02:29:24.223 --> 02:29:26.344]  Do you need an instruction manual for your kid?
[02:29:26.805 --> 02:29:35.089]  I'm behavioral therapist James Lehman, and I'll show you how to change your child's behavior now with the Total Transformation, the program that helps stop defiance and backtalking.
[02:29:35.329 --> 02:29:36.649]  Your child will listen to you again.
[02:29:36.669 --> 02:29:37.570]  I guarantee it.
[02:29:38.070 --> 02:29:41.772]  Call now, 1-800-373-0402.
[02:29:41.792 --> 02:29:42.232]  1-800-373-0402.
[02:29:42.252 --> 02:29:46.835]  Cool weather brings cool cars!
[02:29:47.255 --> 02:29:48.156]  I don't think so.
[02:29:48.476 --> 02:29:52.118]  A cooling system can run too hot or too cold if not prepared for winter.
[02:29:52.478 --> 02:29:53.499]  Here's your to-do.
[02:29:53.739 --> 02:29:56.500]  Ask your local shop to perform the BG Coolant Flush.
[02:29:56.700 --> 02:30:02.323]  A simple test strip tells if your coolant's protecting the engine from temperature extremes or breaking down and corroding.
[02:30:02.704 --> 02:30:06.846]  The BG Chemistry cleans the system, then adds new coolant with conditioners.
[02:30:07.086 --> 02:30:11.911]  Ask your shop for a BG Coolant Flush or go to BGfindashop.com.
[02:30:12.152 --> 02:30:14.214]  That's BGfindashop.com!
[02:30:14.873 --> 02:30:18.475]  Want to know the secret to finding a shop that can keep your car running like new?
[02:30:18.655 --> 02:30:22.557]  Find the cleanest shop in town, where cleaning is top priority.
[02:30:22.717 --> 02:30:26.239]  Not talking about clean floors, but better shops have those too.
[02:30:26.599 --> 02:30:34.204]  I mean shops that have the best training, equipment, and chemistry to clean every air, fuel, and fluid system in your vehicle.
[02:30:34.464 --> 02:30:37.745]  Keep it clean and you don't have to keep replacing parts.
[02:30:38.166 --> 02:30:41.808]  Find your clean shop at bgfindashop.com.
[02:30:42.068 --> 02:30:44.109]  That's bgfindashop.com.
[02:30:45.180 --> 02:30:50.264]  We don't need no education.
[02:30:50.304 --> 02:30:55.788]  We don't need no thought control.
[02:30:55.908 --> 02:31:00.191]  No dark sarcasm in the classroom.
[02:31:00.211 --> 02:31:01.572]  Paul Watson!
[02:31:11.394 --> 02:31:14.357]  Everything that's happening is so overtly tyrannical.
[02:31:14.857 --> 02:31:15.618]  It's classical.
[02:31:17.700 --> 02:31:27.528]  And let's get through these three final callers and see what these great folks have to say and then I want to get more into that and more on the torture and the collapse in Iraq and how it's all by design.
[02:31:29.069 --> 02:31:31.191]  Right now let's go to Paul in Ohio.
[02:31:31.231 --> 02:31:32.732]  You're on the air with Paul Watson, Paul.
[02:31:33.593 --> 02:31:36.856]  Hey Alex, hey Paul.
[02:31:37.817 --> 02:31:38.718]  I wanted to say that
[02:31:40.396 --> 02:31:43.457]  I remember you talked a long time ago.
[02:31:43.478 --> 02:31:50.421]  I remember you saying something about how people in the whole truth movement used to be attacked individually.
[02:31:50.441 --> 02:31:53.802]  And now so many people are waking up.
[02:31:54.163 --> 02:32:04.928]  I think the tactic they're probably going to use is poisoning us, the environment, M-trails, you know, the mercury, all the stuff in our food.
[02:32:06.548 --> 02:32:08.509]  And you talked about Endgame and
[02:32:10.627 --> 02:32:14.449]  First off, I want to tell you, I want to get into a little bit about the Mayan Calendar and stuff.
[02:32:15.309 --> 02:32:18.151]  But, uh, there's a book called Ender's Game.
[02:32:19.451 --> 02:32:29.276]  And it's about in the future, everything being, uh, kind of run, get all your food and clothing, uh, sold to you by robot stores.
[02:32:30.276 --> 02:32:33.758]  And the only place where people can get away is in virtual reality.
[02:32:33.778 --> 02:32:38.660]  So it's all about these people escaping all the harsh, you know, realities of their lives.
[02:32:39.921 --> 02:32:41.023]  Yeah, wireheads.
[02:32:41.063 --> 02:32:42.164]  That's very dangerous.
[02:32:43.365 --> 02:32:52.517]  Being able to electronically stimulate pleasure centers of the brain is many more times addictive than heroin and is going to be very, very destructive on human societies.
[02:32:53.378 --> 02:32:54.660]  Yeah, wireheaded hedonism.
[02:32:55.834 --> 02:32:58.996]  Well, there's a lot of it, but that's what the globalists are trying to sell us.
[02:32:59.577 --> 02:33:01.458]  That's what the Pentagon is trying to sell us.
[02:33:01.498 --> 02:33:06.002]  And of course, the quote, underground, is pitching it as alternative and rebellious.
[02:33:06.482 --> 02:33:07.563]  It is anything but.
[02:33:07.703 --> 02:33:09.865]  It is the death of the human spirit.
[02:33:09.885 --> 02:33:10.706]  Thank you for the call.
[02:33:11.046 --> 02:33:20.653]  Paul Watson, I don't want to be mean to the last caller, but I know a lot about the Mayans, and they were, and the Mayans, that was just a way of life.
[02:33:20.693 --> 02:33:23.796]  The Mayans was, just means the people.
[02:33:24.967 --> 02:33:31.308]  You have the Aztecs and the Toltecs and all of them, but it was just the science of the stars.
[02:33:31.948 --> 02:33:35.849]  And they sacrificed, in places like Chichen Itza every few years, 10,000 people.
[02:33:36.349 --> 02:33:37.630]  People ate their own children.
[02:33:38.590 --> 02:33:48.512]  They would have hallucinations with different hallucinogenic drugs and pull big ropes full of obsidian glass in their tongues to have hallucinations and be possessed by the horned god.
[02:33:49.546 --> 02:34:00.933]  And, you know, just because these lunatics think that the gods go to sleep or wake up, you know, every 5,000 whatever years, I mean, all these people think the world ends in 2012.
[02:34:01.513 --> 02:34:03.455]  All these people think that's why the government's doing this.
[02:34:03.795 --> 02:34:04.475]  Oh, they're doing that.
[02:34:04.535 --> 02:34:06.316]  I mean, did Hitler do it because of 2012?
[02:34:06.877 --> 02:34:08.758]  Did Caesar enslave people because of 2012?
[02:34:08.878 --> 02:34:11.459]  It's just amazing.
[02:34:11.519 --> 02:34:12.540]  Paul, you want to comment on that?
[02:34:13.801 --> 02:34:16.222]  Well, yeah, it's like somebody flips the switch at 2012 and, uh,
[02:34:17.944 --> 02:34:19.825]  Everybody wakes up or the world ends.
[02:34:19.905 --> 02:34:21.466]  I've read about it many times before.
[02:34:23.047 --> 02:34:29.510]  They've discredited Orthodox religion because they're scribes and Pharisees, etc.
[02:34:29.530 --> 02:34:37.634]  You've got Bush, a self-proclaimed born-again Christian who worships a 40-foot stone owl, a satanic compound.
[02:34:38.195 --> 02:34:42.257]  People see that and say, if that's God, I want nothing to do with it.
[02:34:42.397 --> 02:34:44.138]  So then they go back and find these
[02:34:44.767 --> 02:34:51.516]  New Age, which are really old age religions, and pour themselves into that as if it's alternative and rebellious, when it's not.
[02:34:51.856 --> 02:34:54.239]  Well, let me just say this, and I'm not mad at the caller.
[02:34:54.259 --> 02:34:56.041]  It's interesting that he brought it up, and I'm glad he did.
[02:34:56.943 --> 02:34:58.725]  But let me just digress on this subject.
[02:34:59.511 --> 02:35:02.932]  We have all these documents, all these admissions, links to army field manuals.
[02:35:02.992 --> 02:35:03.692]  It's all public.
[02:35:03.732 --> 02:35:05.612]  Giant camps being built all over the place.
[02:35:06.873 --> 02:35:09.573]  Senate chairman calling for arresting all the peace activists.
[02:35:09.933 --> 02:35:10.873]  It's all happening.
[02:35:11.093 --> 02:35:15.434]  So I guess that means more than half the population should go to camps.
[02:35:16.235 --> 02:35:22.476]  And Bush's approval rating is at thirty-some percent, so I guess, you know, sixty-something percent needs to go to the camps.
[02:35:23.716 --> 02:35:27.337]  But most people that listen to this show, I mean a large portion of them,
[02:35:28.192 --> 02:35:35.477]  They just love some rumor about camps, but then for years we've had the documents, and it's really hard to get people to pay attention.
[02:35:35.897 --> 02:35:41.100]  That's why I'm excited now that it's hitting mainstream news, because it is getting some traction, Paul.
[02:35:42.161 --> 02:35:53.128]  Well yeah, as I wrote, it was once the bane of the stereotypical caricature of loony right-wing conspiracy theorists wearing tinfoil hats.
[02:35:53.564 --> 02:35:55.286]  You know, concentration camps in America.
[02:35:55.627 --> 02:36:03.197]  Now Peter Dale Scott, this left-wing bastion author, is writing about it and sounding like Alex Jones.
[02:36:03.277 --> 02:36:07.103]  So, you know, he's on Alternate as well, which is a big left-wing organization.
[02:36:07.283 --> 02:36:10.127]  And linking directly to the mainstream documents, you see.
[02:36:10.942 --> 02:36:17.346]  Yeah, they're not hoodwinked just to defend the Muslims and the precious illegal immigrants.
[02:36:17.666 --> 02:36:22.330]  They directly state that it's the cover for the eventual roundup of Americans, as was Rex 84.
[02:36:22.410 --> 02:36:24.311]  Because it says it in both documents.
[02:36:24.331 --> 02:36:25.872]  The Houston Chronicle even admitted that.
[02:36:27.106 --> 02:36:28.987]  So that's the bottom line.
[02:36:29.427 --> 02:36:36.968]  What I'm trying to say is that just because the media and the government lie and twist, doesn't then mean that everybody in the alternative is telling you the truth.
[02:36:36.988 --> 02:36:46.891]  Just because they're bad in the establishment, doesn't mean people telling you that the Mayan calendar is real, and that astrology is real, saying the Earth is the center of the universe.
[02:36:47.751 --> 02:36:51.532]  People think because I'm alternative media, I then buy into every other thing.
[02:36:52.172 --> 02:36:53.572]  And that's why we have a lot of listeners.
[02:36:53.592 --> 02:36:55.753]  Despite all my foibles and problems, I'm not perfect.
[02:36:56.905 --> 02:36:59.366]  Is that people know, I mean, this is real stuff we talk about.
[02:37:00.047 --> 02:37:00.887]  This isn't a game.
[02:37:01.567 --> 02:37:02.928]  Let's talk to Rodney in Texas.
[02:37:02.988 --> 02:37:03.808]  Rodney, you're on the air.
[02:37:04.228 --> 02:37:06.069]  Hey, thanks for taking my call, Alex.
[02:37:06.129 --> 02:37:10.411]  I have one question for Sir Watson and one question for you.
[02:37:12.232 --> 02:37:18.715]  Mr. Watson, I'm curious about the climate and mindset of the Brits regarding this recent
[02:37:19.713 --> 02:37:31.201]  Revelation on the ID cards and also your version of our concentration camps over here, euphemistically referred to as rest and relaxation centers.
[02:37:31.221 --> 02:37:35.204]  Can you expand on the mindset and climate of the Brits?
[02:37:35.284 --> 02:37:38.246]  Yeah, they just openly announced a civil contingency bill.
[02:37:38.266 --> 02:37:40.948]  We're going to take you and put you in rest and relocation centers.
[02:37:41.008 --> 02:37:44.771]  Of course, you'll be broken up from your families, but it's for your safety.
[02:37:44.831 --> 02:37:46.672]  It's for sanitation, Paul.
[02:37:48.106 --> 02:37:50.727]  Yeah, it was in the Civil Contingencies Bill.
[02:37:52.488 --> 02:37:58.852]  Any kind of dirty bomb attack and they'll set up these temporary camps and round up people.
[02:37:58.872 --> 02:38:01.854]  There were articles which said dirty bomb victims will be shot.
[02:38:03.314 --> 02:38:13.700]  The attitude of the British people to ID cards, the government's been caught faking poll numbers to try and make out as if 80% of the British population supports ID cards.
[02:38:14.622 --> 02:38:17.264]  It's more likely that it's split 50-50.
[02:38:17.424 --> 02:38:19.586]  Actually, Paul, you forget.
[02:38:19.626 --> 02:38:24.810]  You've done an article years ago that the government in a poll was caught faking the numbers.
[02:38:24.850 --> 02:38:25.791]  That's mainstream news.
[02:38:26.151 --> 02:38:30.194]  And they've done other independent polls and 79-85% are against it.
[02:38:30.434 --> 02:38:31.215]  I've seen those numbers.
[02:38:31.415 --> 02:38:38.180]  There was a BBC one about two weeks ago which asked, will ID cards protect us against terrorism?
[02:38:38.200 --> 02:38:39.981]  79% said no.
[02:38:40.762 --> 02:38:43.324]  So if that's the kind of benchmark, then it's obviously not
[02:38:44.096 --> 02:38:46.958]  You know, flip the other way, 80% support them.
[02:38:48.919 --> 02:39:06.491]  Obviously British people, just like Americans are slaves of convenience, about 50% of the people will take them, even though the government got caught trying to fund the scheme by promising to sell all the data to private companies, which they can then use to spam you with mail order offers.
[02:39:06.691 --> 02:39:13.736]  And most identity fraud is caused by government and private industry sales of data, it is not the internet that's causing it, they just want to bring in controls.
[02:39:14.525 --> 02:39:16.486]  Yeah, they've been caught lying about the cost of it.
[02:39:16.526 --> 02:39:20.467]  London School of Economics proved that it would be far higher than they suggested.
[02:39:22.027 --> 02:39:25.208]  Studies have shown it's going to increase identity fraud.
[02:39:25.529 --> 02:39:26.949]  Their own government internal studies.
[02:39:27.729 --> 02:39:29.430]  Rodney, that's your questions to him.
[02:39:29.550 --> 02:39:31.471]  I have one for you, Alex, real quickly.
[02:39:32.251 --> 02:39:38.853]  The Bellevue News Democrat today reported that the magic bullet man, Arlen Specter,
[02:39:39.451 --> 02:39:44.955]  That's decided that he will go ahead and sign off on the Patriot Act
[02:39:47.000 --> 02:39:49.521]  Even though he has serious concerns about poverty.
[02:39:49.541 --> 02:39:50.422]  Yeah, I didn't know.
[02:39:50.502 --> 02:39:54.083]  I mean, Bush lobbied to have him become chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee.
[02:39:54.684 --> 02:39:56.684]  The guy has always been their minion.
[02:39:57.145 --> 02:39:59.966]  And so when he got up on TV and said, this is a serious question.
[02:39:59.986 --> 02:40:02.747]  Is the president, is he the final arbiter of the law?
[02:40:03.187 --> 02:40:04.648]  I don't believe so, but it may be.
[02:40:04.748 --> 02:40:06.829]  And I said, folks, he does that to get credibility.
[02:40:07.149 --> 02:40:08.329]  He's going to sign off on it.
[02:40:08.369 --> 02:40:09.510]  And yes, I saw the reports.
[02:40:09.530 --> 02:40:13.952]  And now he's saying, well, I looked at it and yes, we need the Patriot Act, though I have some questions.
[02:40:14.612 --> 02:40:16.653]  And he is a dictator, yeah.
[02:40:17.253 --> 02:40:19.134]  I mean, I said a month ago what he was going to do.
[02:40:19.154 --> 02:40:19.734]  It wasn't hard.
[02:40:19.754 --> 02:40:20.554]  I played a clip of him.
[02:40:20.714 --> 02:40:27.237]  Yeah, tell us about the draconian bells and whistles that he didn't mention that you have brought out.
[02:40:27.497 --> 02:40:28.597]  Well, he's the one that added them.
[02:40:28.617 --> 02:40:29.778]  The National Police Force.
[02:40:30.178 --> 02:40:31.818]  A year and a half in prison for any reason.
[02:40:31.838 --> 02:40:32.759]  I don't have to say why.
[02:40:32.779 --> 02:40:36.780]  And it's the reason to put you in the camps.
[02:40:37.400 --> 02:40:39.141]  It's the Nazis can pick you up for any reason.
[02:40:39.561 --> 02:40:40.261]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:40:40.341 --> 02:40:41.842]  And thank you, Sir Watson.
[02:40:43.613 --> 02:40:46.034]  He hasn't gotten any indulgences from the Queen now.
[02:40:46.174 --> 02:40:47.855]  He doesn't like the Queen, do you, Paul?
[02:40:47.875 --> 02:40:50.216]  Do you like your German Visigoth leader?
[02:40:51.036 --> 02:40:52.497]  Yeah, long terrain over us.
[02:40:57.099 --> 02:41:06.724]  Most opposed to free speech, we're riding around with a tour guide in London in the open-backed bus at the top and she's actually allowed to say whatever you want at Speaker's Corner, where everybody stops and argues, you know, soapboxes.
[02:41:07.024 --> 02:41:09.345]  But do not criticize the Queen or instant arrest.
[02:41:09.706 --> 02:41:10.286]  Remember that, Paul?
[02:41:11.750 --> 02:41:16.734]  Yeah, and the problem is in London that everybody's quite rude and nobody really talks to each other anyway.
[02:41:16.814 --> 02:41:19.897]  So it's not a breeding ground for freedom of speech.
[02:41:19.917 --> 02:41:23.400]  People are scared to talk to their neighbors.
[02:41:23.620 --> 02:41:23.940]  You bet.
[02:41:23.960 --> 02:41:26.422]  I want to get into the whole planned Iraq insanity.
[02:41:26.803 --> 02:41:27.543]  Get into that in a minute.
[02:41:27.563 --> 02:41:28.284]  Final call.
[02:41:28.845 --> 02:41:30.206]  David in Texas, you're on the air.
[02:41:30.226 --> 02:41:31.206]  Hi.
[02:41:31.587 --> 02:41:32.107]  Oh, Alex.
[02:41:32.347 --> 02:41:33.468]  Always a distinguished honor.
[02:41:33.809 --> 02:41:35.030]  No, it's an honor to you to call me.
[02:41:35.070 --> 02:41:35.450]  Thank you.
[02:41:35.770 --> 02:41:36.191]  Well, thank you.
[02:41:37.472 --> 02:41:38.833]  Indeed, I live in Dallas, Fort Worth.
[02:41:39.540 --> 02:41:43.843]  What radio stations can I show people that they can listen to?
[02:41:43.863 --> 02:41:51.749]  Sure, we're on, you know, when I say we're on dozens and dozens and dozens and dozens and dozens, I forget how many now, AM and FM affiliates, that sounds like a lot, but it's not.
[02:41:52.250 --> 02:42:01.877]  There are, what, 1,400 talk stations, 10,000 plus stations total, but around, it changes every year, but it's like 1,400 talk stations.
[02:42:02.337 --> 02:42:04.239]  Most of those are owned by three conglomerates.
[02:42:04.879 --> 02:42:07.841]  So, you know, we're on in Southern California.
[02:42:07.881 --> 02:42:08.902]  We're on in Kansas City.
[02:42:08.922 --> 02:42:09.862]  We're on in Austin.
[02:42:10.663 --> 02:42:12.824]  We're on in, you know, a lot of these places.
[02:42:13.445 --> 02:42:17.567]  Chicago, upstate New York, Pensacola, Florida.
[02:42:17.968 --> 02:42:21.910]  I mean, there's a lot of affiliates, but no, we're not on in Dallas or Houston.
[02:42:22.250 --> 02:42:25.252]  We're on in Austin, Corpus Christi, and a few other places in Texas.
[02:42:25.752 --> 02:42:29.555]  Well, we were on in a couple other stations in Texas, and then they get bought.
[02:42:30.111 --> 02:42:32.231]  Stations are always getting bought and format changes.
[02:42:32.731 --> 02:42:33.892]  So we're not on in Dallas.
[02:42:33.912 --> 02:42:35.672]  You can listen on the shortwave and the internet.
[02:42:36.132 --> 02:42:39.873]  You can tell people, I mean what, over half the population now has computers and internet access.
[02:42:40.173 --> 02:42:41.873]  Just tell them to listen to InfoWars.com.
[02:42:42.413 --> 02:42:43.013]  Absolutely do.
[02:42:43.073 --> 02:42:45.094]  Now, my main question real quick to the both of you.
[02:42:45.634 --> 02:42:53.295]  The new thing with the Halliburton contract and the March 15th supposed house raid that these protesters want to do on the 15th.
[02:42:53.975 --> 02:42:58.096]  Do you think that Halliburton having places in the UAE
[02:42:59.169 --> 02:43:01.130]  Uh, and the SWOT basically to get our ports.
[02:43:01.371 --> 02:43:07.274]  That's the tipping point for this solution that's about to begin, and then that will catalyst the martial law.
[02:43:07.374 --> 02:43:10.396]  Oh no, I don't think that somebody's going to protest and they're doing this overnight.
[02:43:10.456 --> 02:43:17.020]  No, it's just a slow incremental laying the foundations, then building the superstructure, and then putting in the fixtures.
[02:43:17.600 --> 02:43:19.821]  I mean, they've been building this, now they're announcing it.
[02:43:19.841 --> 02:43:22.923]  You see, to use it, they've got to announce it and legitimize it.
[02:43:23.964 --> 02:43:24.084]  Yes.
[02:43:25.290 --> 02:43:28.152]  So I was just wondering, maybe this would be the reason for that legitimacy.
[02:43:28.672 --> 02:43:31.054]  Well, yeah, you've always got to watch.
[02:43:32.035 --> 02:43:35.117]  The reason for the big kickoff, sir, will be a staged terror attack.
[02:43:35.437 --> 02:43:36.278]  Paul, do you agree with that?
[02:43:37.379 --> 02:43:47.846]  Yeah, I think the example that the caller raises was WorldNetDaily kind of twisting the language from some left-wing protesters and making it out as if they were going to
[02:43:48.530 --> 02:43:50.012]  Invade the White House.
[02:43:50.152 --> 02:43:51.573]  I don't think that's the plan at all.
[02:43:51.633 --> 02:43:53.796]  And obviously, they wouldn't get past the front gate.
[02:43:53.896 --> 02:43:55.578]  So, uh, it's just not gonna happen.
[02:43:57.720 --> 02:44:00.563]  Yeah, that's... I mean, you... They're really suspect over there, sir.
[02:44:01.344 --> 02:44:06.589]  I was just curious, because I saw it on your website, and I just wanted to... Yeah, no, we link over to them, but we're trying to give people a wide view.
[02:44:06.629 --> 02:44:08.051]  We put stuff up we don't agree with.
[02:44:08.869 --> 02:44:15.033]  Okay, I just wanted to check on that and see if the UAE had something to do with Halliburton having their people there.
[02:44:15.554 --> 02:44:18.275]  If that had anything to do with a swap, maybe with the ports here.
[02:44:18.736 --> 02:44:19.937]  Okay, thank you for the call.
[02:44:20.257 --> 02:44:24.440]  Paul, since people don't know what we're talking about, why don't you fill them in on this protest or situation?
[02:44:26.261 --> 02:44:28.582]  It was the World Net Daily story yesterday, I believe.
[02:44:29.683 --> 02:44:38.389]  It said that a left-wing protest group planned to raid the White House, I believe on March 15th, as a protest against the war.
[02:44:39.304 --> 02:44:43.810]  But the protest leaders denied that they were physically going to do it.
[02:44:43.830 --> 02:44:46.393]  It was just a term of protest.
[02:44:46.473 --> 02:44:48.416]  So, it's not going to happen.
[02:44:49.017 --> 02:44:50.739]  Well, it's like we call it an info war.
[02:44:50.779 --> 02:44:52.862]  That doesn't mean we're shooting missiles at anybody.
[02:44:53.342 --> 02:44:53.563]  Right.
[02:44:54.771 --> 02:44:59.815]  You know, if I say we're going to blow apart their lives, that's figurative and everyone knows what that means.
[02:45:00.376 --> 02:45:07.721]  But they've got to keep this bunker mentality going, oh, we're in danger, the protesters, they're really fifth column terrorists, arrest them.
[02:45:08.061 --> 02:45:18.890]  Paul, let's get into the shrine bombing and how our own government, PNAC, and others, and then the Israeli documents from 1983 and 84, admit this has been the plan all along.
[02:45:18.910 --> 02:45:19.430]  Tell us about it.
[02:45:19.450 --> 02:45:20.891]  Right.
[02:45:21.452 --> 02:45:23.934]  Well, there's no conjecture on whether the
[02:45:24.838 --> 02:45:39.441]  Occupational government is staging incidents in Iraq because April 2003, fall of the Baghdad Saddam statue, it was in the LA Times, they admitted it was a Pentagon psychological operation for the watching world's media.
[02:45:39.461 --> 02:45:42.841]  So they admitted that they staged events.
[02:45:43.381 --> 02:45:50.182]  Then you've got obviously recently the Samara Mosque bombing, which the Iranians came out and said was a US-Israeli operation.
[02:45:50.923 --> 02:45:53.103]  Ray McGovern said that they're the ones with the motive.
[02:45:54.127 --> 02:46:04.755]  You had a guest on yesterday, Dayya Jamal, who said that neither Sunnis or Shiites would have any motive or inclination to bomb religious sites.
[02:46:05.635 --> 02:46:07.737]  So who has the motive?
[02:46:07.997 --> 02:46:17.543]  The SAS British soldiers caught dressed up in Arab garb, Arab wigs, attempting to attack Iraqi police.
[02:46:17.863 --> 02:46:20.105]  They're caught, arrested, taken to jail and then
[02:46:21.083 --> 02:46:31.109]  All the British tanks roll in, basically destroy half the jail, 200 prisoners escape, but they get back their operatives who had tried to stage this event.
[02:46:32.370 --> 02:46:37.773]  They're also running around, they had shot Iraqi policemen in Bahr, blaming it on the Iranians, and had bombs.
[02:46:38.794 --> 02:46:50.301]  Yeah, and then we've showcased many examples in the past whereby different bombings, eyewitnesses say they were the result of US warplanes, you know, you've got giant craters,
[02:46:52.008 --> 02:47:01.435]  The Australian TV news actually gave credibility to the fact that the bombings were being initiated, carried out by US, British and Israeli forces.
[02:47:02.175 --> 02:47:08.520]  So, the question is, is Iraq drifting towards civil war by design?
[02:47:09.801 --> 02:47:17.046]  Negro Ponzi Mr. Death Squad came out today and said that a civil war in Iraq could lead to a broader conflict in the Middle East.
[02:47:17.747 --> 02:47:19.468]  So has that been the plan all along?
[02:47:19.829 --> 02:47:20.349]  We've got
[02:47:21.602 --> 02:47:25.144]  Oded Yinon's A Strategy for Israel in the 1980s.
[02:47:25.544 --> 02:47:29.707]  Yinon was an official from the Israeli Foreign Affairs Office.
[02:47:30.267 --> 02:47:43.654]  He wrote the paper, which has now been parroted by Leslie Gelb of the CFR and others, which calls for ethnic cleansing to be initiated for the Arabs to war with each other
[02:47:44.181 --> 02:47:48.443]  To keep the Middle East sectarian so Israel could dominate it.
[02:47:48.723 --> 02:47:56.065]  Well, specifically they say we'll have the US invade Iraq, this is even in the Jerusalem Post, and then we'll break it up in three or four different sections.
[02:47:56.945 --> 02:48:01.947]  Yeah, the quote is from the paper, quote, to dissolve Iraq is more important for us than dissolving Syria.
[02:48:02.327 --> 02:48:06.109]  In the short term, it's Iraqi power that constitutes the greatest threat to Israel.
[02:48:06.509 --> 02:48:09.650]  The Iran-Iraq war tore Iraq apart and provoked its downfall.
[02:48:10.186 --> 02:48:18.573]  All manner of inter-Arab conflict help us and accelerate our goal of breaking up Iraq into small diverse pieces.
[02:48:19.534 --> 02:48:27.820]  So there is clearly an agenda to balkanize Iraq and ethnic cleansing, maim children, thousands of dead American soldiers aren't going to stop them.
[02:48:29.642 --> 02:48:33.405]  There you go boys and girls, some final news tidbits on the other side of that big announcement.
[02:48:33.505 --> 02:48:35.306]  As soon as he gets off the air he's going to post it.

[02:48:46.378 --> 02:48:49.239]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[02:48:49.499 --> 02:48:51.080]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[02:48:51.420 --> 02:48:56.082]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[02:48:56.422 --> 02:49:03.165]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[02:49:03.485 --> 02:49:05.467]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[02:49:05.667 --> 02:49:08.509]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[02:49:08.609 --> 02:49:13.273]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[02:49:13.473 --> 02:49:17.876]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[02:49:18.117 --> 02:49:25.342]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.

[02:49:45.680 --> 02:49:50.904]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[02:49:51.044 --> 02:49:59.130]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[02:49:59.390 --> 02:50:07.897]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident, radioactive poisoning.
[02:50:08.217 --> 02:50:13.881]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[02:50:14.082 --> 02:50:19.166]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[02:50:19.266 --> 02:50:28.153]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[02:50:28.413 --> 02:50:31.715]  Order the official Potassium Iodate for only $24 and save $5.

[02:51:49.345 --> 02:51:50.906]  This show is documented.
[02:51:51.386 --> 02:51:54.147]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:51:54.567 --> 02:52:02.649]  It's extremely clear that the plan all along was to get in there, get us stuck in a quagmire.
[02:52:02.689 --> 02:52:05.810]  They said we'll be there decades, generations, invade other countries.
[02:52:05.850 --> 02:52:11.752]  It's in all the PNAC documents, but then they go look at the Israeli documents, which are a big part of the war planning, is to break it up in three or four regions.
[02:52:12.012 --> 02:52:16.054]  And I've heard NPR going, oh, the plan now is to break it up into different regions.
[02:52:16.114 --> 02:52:17.094]  It's very intellectual.
[02:52:18.390 --> 02:52:21.952]  That's what the British tried to do, and it's just a repeat of this.
[02:52:22.032 --> 02:52:34.038]  And you know, the last caller, the more I thought about his point, that, you know, by hyping up that protesters are trying to raid the White House, is this the pretext to start grabbing protesters and arresting them?
[02:52:34.319 --> 02:52:38.221]  And yes, we know they do provocateur through some of these groups as well, Paul.
[02:52:40.102 --> 02:52:46.265]  Yeah, well, I mean, we highlighted the example last week with the Toledo arrest.
[02:52:47.675 --> 02:52:57.761]  They use entrapment to try and stoke hostility within these different groups, like the FBI got caught creating a Klan group in 98, I believe.
[02:52:58.882 --> 02:53:01.124]  And it's the same with terrorist organizations.
[02:53:02.124 --> 02:53:13.091]  They always stoke up the resentment, and then the ringleader of the organization is an FBI or government informer, like Iman Faris, the guy who supposedly was going to blow up the Brooklyn Bridge.
[02:53:14.092 --> 02:53:20.948]  Um, and then they use that to create staged terror arrests and fake terror alerts to boost their own propaganda.
[02:53:22.381 --> 02:53:32.724]  Well, we've been doing an incredible job, the whole team here at the Infowars Network, as we call it, but you and your brother and others, and we've been collaborating, writing these articles, you've been churning them out.
[02:53:33.044 --> 02:53:39.766]  They're all on the most important of issues, and another one, just to show the evil of these people, how they're liars, it's now admitted.
[02:53:39.826 --> 02:53:44.988]  I mean, Diana said on the videotape and in her diary, Charles says he's going to kill me in a fake auto accident.
[02:53:45.008 --> 02:53:47.548]  A couple months later, she's dead, and now it's admitted.
[02:53:47.608 --> 02:53:49.029]  I mean, it's in major British news.
[02:53:49.509 --> 02:53:56.655]  The majority of people think that the Prince killed her, and they know it's a big lie, and the government's admitting that, quote, intelligence agencies were involved.
[02:53:56.715 --> 02:53:58.996]  Well, we knew that seven, eight years ago, Paul.
[02:54:00.357 --> 02:54:04.421]  Yeah, I mean, the official investigation is only confirming what we already knew.
[02:54:05.001 --> 02:54:18.031]  It's now admitted that they swapped the blood sample of the driver, Henri Paul, with somebody who had died from carbon monoxide poisoning to make it appear as if he was inebriated, drunk, so he crashed the car for that reason.
[02:54:19.147 --> 02:54:22.770]  Henri Paul himself, the driver, was working for French Secret Service.
[02:54:23.591 --> 02:54:25.492]  French Secret Service were in the tunnel.
[02:54:25.973 --> 02:54:30.456]  He got this flash of light, witnessed by eyewitnesses, which caused the crash.
[02:54:31.617 --> 02:54:35.720]  And the investigation is confirming all that, but will it go anywhere?
[02:54:36.781 --> 02:54:46.168]  The same guy, Lord Stephens, investigated IRA terrorism, which led back to MI5, controlling it, but it went nowhere.
[02:54:47.554 --> 02:54:48.514]  You know, where will it go?
[02:54:50.195 --> 02:54:54.216]  Well, my friend, I want to thank you for your great work and I want to thank you for joining us.
[02:54:54.256 --> 02:55:07.499]  PrisonPlanet.tv, so much media, now over a thousand pieces of media, audio, video, other films, all my films, video interviews here in studio, my award-winning local TV show, that's won Best TV Show in Austin in the Reader's Poll.
[02:55:07.519 --> 02:55:09.800]  I'm not bragging, it's a pretty good TV show.
[02:55:10.420 --> 02:55:15.221]  PrisonPlanet.tv, you can now, for the next month, get a yearly membership
[02:55:15.919 --> 02:55:19.201]  Well, yeah, it was so popular back then that we decided to bring it back for spring.
[02:55:19.221 --> 02:55:20.782]  And there's an entire library of material now.
[02:55:20.822 --> 02:55:22.023]  There's a TV show going up tonight.
[02:55:22.063 --> 02:55:23.323]  There's another one going up tomorrow night.
[02:55:43.283 --> 02:55:46.453]  Three or four video reports in one week, there's audio interviews, books...
[02:55:47.245 --> 02:55:51.768]  Everything's there, so for $39.95 for a whole year, that is the deal.
[02:55:52.068 --> 02:55:53.989]  Or go try it for $5.95 for a month.
[02:55:54.049 --> 02:55:55.550]  It comes out to about 15 cents a day.
[02:55:55.570 --> 02:55:58.812]  If you get the yearly, it's about 12 cents a day, or even less now.
[02:55:58.832 --> 02:56:00.594]  And it funds us.
[02:56:00.654 --> 02:56:02.135]  It supports us in what we're doing.
[02:56:02.415 --> 02:56:06.197]  It's very serious work, and I know I'm serious and even seem irritable.
[02:56:06.217 --> 02:56:09.259]  It's because I'm very angry about what's happening, so I want to thank all of you for joining us.
[02:56:09.519 --> 02:56:15.163]  Go to InfoWars.com and get hard copies of DVDs and books we're carrying, or my own films, and that also supports us.
[02:56:16.125 --> 02:56:17.868]  Paul, Godspeed and thanks for coming on.
[02:56:18.188 --> 02:56:18.668]  Thanks, Mike.
