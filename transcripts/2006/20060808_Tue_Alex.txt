[00:00:05.544 --> 00:00:06.204]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.845 --> 00:00:07.925]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.626 --> 00:00:09.806]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.387 --> 00:00:11.227]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.948 --> 00:00:12.848]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.868 --> 00:00:17.471]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.711 --> 00:00:21.793]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:40.953 --> 00:00:46.336]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to this live Tuesday edition, the eighth day
[00:00:47.428 --> 00:00:53.194]  Of August 2006, we'll be live here for the next three hours.
[00:00:53.295 --> 00:01:04.787]  Michael Rivera of WhatReallyHappened.com, a great investigative journalist and blogger, will be joining us for his monthly report with us in the second hour from Hawaii.
[00:01:05.648 --> 00:01:07.570]  We'll have open phones throughout the day.
[00:01:08.266 --> 00:01:13.550]  And there is so much important news and information that we're going to be covering in the meantime.
[00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:36.865]  There was a chilling story yesterday out of the Scotsman, there were several other in the British news, concerning these beauty clinics where wealthy women go and pay tens of thousands of dollars per treatment for the stem cells out of aborted babies that are then put into their bodies and oh, it gives them wonderful youthful looks.
[00:01:37.435 --> 00:01:51.567]  And the women are in the story saying they don't care where it comes from, whether it's from the umbilical cord, which I think if people want to sell that to pharmacological systems, fine, or from dead babies.
[00:01:51.667 --> 00:01:52.548]  They don't care!
[00:01:52.568 --> 00:02:02.636]  That, of course, is horrible and cannibalistic, and it just shows the decadence, the incredible decadence of the population where women
[00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:07.462]  will do absolutely anything to keep their youthful appearance.
[00:02:07.522 --> 00:02:11.064]  It's just one more indicator of a society going completely to seed.
[00:02:11.684 --> 00:02:13.946]  Major new escalations in the Middle East.
[00:02:14.006 --> 00:02:28.593]  It's clear that the neocons are trying to open up a second front for political purposes of distraction and are really cheerleading and pushing and openly calling for World War III.
[00:02:28.713 --> 00:02:30.474]  It is unprecedented.
[00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.400]  We'll be covering those reports.
[00:02:33.681 --> 00:02:35.041]  Bush here in the Associated Press.
[00:02:35.341 --> 00:02:37.461]  Bush cautions on Lebanon's ceasefire.
[00:02:37.761 --> 00:02:39.202]  Oh, don't have a ceasefire!
[00:02:39.462 --> 00:02:40.762]  Oh, no, don't!
[00:02:41.062 --> 00:02:41.382]  Don't!
[00:02:41.602 --> 00:02:42.682]  Keep the war going!
[00:02:42.723 --> 00:02:43.863]  Give war a chance!
[00:02:45.403 --> 00:02:53.965]  And of course, big news to all of us in the 9-11 Truth Movement, the linchpin to the globalists' ongoing operations of tyranny here domestically.
[00:02:54.005 --> 00:02:58.546]  A report today of over 30 million surveillance cameras in the United States and growing.
[00:02:59.921 --> 00:03:03.045]  Which, of course, they're using the fear from 9-11 to push.
[00:03:03.706 --> 00:03:08.853]  And so 9-11 is a key issue to expose an absolute foundational system.
[00:03:09.874 --> 00:03:14.080]  Bloggers wonder what happened to Mr. Conspiracy.
[00:03:15.023 --> 00:03:29.249]  And it's a big LA Times story today, featuring myself, Jack Blood, John Connor of the Resistance Manifesto, giving our different takes on Oliver Stone's new 9-11 film.
[00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:31.670]  And some 9-11 truth comes out in the story.
[00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:36.591]  And also a big article out of the Village Voice.
[00:03:39.633 --> 00:03:42.954]  The Village Voice has a headline, Fakes on a Plane.
[00:03:43.743 --> 00:04:12.346]  Conspiracy buffs craft their own online WTC movies and it gives a review of Terror Storm, it gives a review of Loose Change 2nd Edition and several other documentaries and we've got those linked up at the top of InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com so we'll go over these articles before this hour ends and again there are
[00:04:13.806 --> 00:04:28.856]  It's got to be 20 or 30, I haven't counted them up, news articles, mainstream news stories about the 9-11 Truth Movement every single day for the last week and a half since the C-SPAN program aired four separate times.
[00:04:29.776 --> 00:04:32.218]  And now we have
[00:04:34.281 --> 00:04:42.884]  Even more mainstream reports about the 9-11 Commission lying, the Pentagon lying, the worm is turning, as Charlie Sheen said on this broadcast.
[00:04:42.904 --> 00:04:50.107]  So, we'll plunge into that after we cover the latest developments in Israel and what's happening on the police state front here in the United States.
[00:04:50.627 --> 00:04:55.809]  After this quick break, the websites are InfoWars.com, JonesReport.com, and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:05:04.301 --> 00:05:09.746]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:05:10.146 --> 00:05:17.812]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:05:18.472 --> 00:05:25.538]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:05:25.938 --> 00:05:32.824]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spies,
[00:05:33.314 --> 00:05:37.396]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:05:37.657 --> 00:05:41.179]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:05:41.639 --> 00:05:43.520]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:47.783]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:06:03.698 --> 00:06:05.299]  Captain, we got trouble.
[00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:05.800]  What?
[00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:07.621]  The cattle haven't had water for two days.
[00:06:07.801 --> 00:06:09.963]  We found a pond, but the cattle won't drink from it.
[00:06:10.023 --> 00:06:10.704]  Well, why not?
[00:06:10.824 --> 00:06:14.346]  Well, Captain, it's loaded with pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites.
[00:06:14.426 --> 00:06:18.630]  It's also contaminated with chemicals such as atrazine, benzene, and MTBE.
[00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:21.472]  And there's even heavy metals like lead and mercury in the water.
[00:06:21.652 --> 00:06:23.193]  Break out the Crown Berkey.
[00:06:23.333 --> 00:06:25.515]  But Captain, we've got 200 head of cattle!
[00:06:25.615 --> 00:06:29.379]  That Crown Berkey will purify 27 gallons of water per hour with 8 elements.
[00:06:29.459 --> 00:06:30.521]  You just keep it full.
[00:06:30.721 --> 00:06:31.081]  Captain!
[00:06:31.241 --> 00:06:31.742]  It's working!
[00:06:31.762 --> 00:06:32.723]  The cattle are drinking!
[00:06:32.943 --> 00:06:33.344]  And look!
[00:06:33.464 --> 00:06:34.365]  They're even smiling!
[00:06:38.318 --> 00:06:40.780]  Berkey, the filter that won the West.
[00:06:41.081 --> 00:06:46.165]  Get your Crown Berkey Purifier with two black Berkey purification elements for only $299 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:06:46.185 --> 00:06:46.445]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:06:46.505 --> 00:06:47.987]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[00:06:48.147 --> 00:06:49.568]  Not yet available in California or Iowa.
[00:07:01.576 --> 00:07:02.397]  Come on, Bill.
[00:07:02.617 --> 00:07:07.800]  Two weeks ago you were riding a bicycle, and today you're showing up in your new car and telling me you're buying a house?
[00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:09.621]  What did you do, rob Bill Gates?
[00:07:09.721 --> 00:07:11.702]  No, John, I didn't rob Bill Gates.
[00:07:11.982 --> 00:07:17.486]  What I did do is visit the website www.DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[00:07:17.786 --> 00:07:24.049]  That's where I learn how to make $3,000 to $9,000 each and every week, starting with my very first week.
[00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:26.591]  It's a simple program that does all the work for you.
[00:07:26.871 --> 00:07:28.172]  I'm already up to $25,000 just going on my third week.
[00:07:30.513 --> 00:07:30.953]  Whoa!
[00:07:31.333 --> 00:07:32.534]  What was that website again?
[00:07:32.614 --> 00:07:36.095]  It's www.DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[00:07:36.395 --> 00:07:37.515]  Now write this down, John.
[00:07:37.635 --> 00:07:41.956]  You should go there and learn how this program can help you become financially independent, too.
[00:07:42.096 --> 00:07:42.676]  Thanks, Bill.
[00:07:42.956 --> 00:07:44.157]  I'm going there right now.
[00:07:44.557 --> 00:07:45.237]  Check, please.
[00:07:47.017 --> 00:07:48.438]  Uh, you got this one, right, Bill?
[00:07:48.938 --> 00:07:49.518]  Sure, John.
[00:07:49.758 --> 00:07:54.119]  Don't forget, it's www.DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[00:07:54.419 --> 00:07:56.100]  Next time, you'll be buying me lunch.
[00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:56.520]  Deal.
[00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:08.333]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:08.953 --> 00:08:11.994]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:22.999 --> 00:08:29.402]  Alright, big new explosive developments on the front lines of the 9-11 Truth Movement.
[00:08:29.422 --> 00:08:30.863]  We'll be getting to articles
[00:08:31.582 --> 00:08:35.623]  In the LA Times, in the Village Voice, shown on the East and West Coast.
[00:08:36.464 --> 00:08:37.344]  We'll be getting into that.
[00:08:37.964 --> 00:08:40.265]  Israel intensifying their bombardments.
[00:08:41.165 --> 00:08:43.606]  And Bush saying, hey, don't give peace a chance.
[00:08:43.686 --> 00:08:44.887]  Don't have a ceasefire.
[00:08:45.607 --> 00:08:46.747]  Let's look at this first.
[00:08:47.747 --> 00:08:48.708]  We'll cover all of it.
[00:08:48.748 --> 00:08:53.169]  Michael Rivero of WhatReallyHappened.com joins us in the second hour.
[00:08:53.810 --> 00:08:55.870]  A barbaric kind of beauty.
[00:08:55.930 --> 00:08:57.971]  This is out of the UK Daily Mail.
[00:09:00.650 --> 00:09:04.553]  And it describes how wealthy women, and it's really a deceptive article.
[00:09:04.633 --> 00:09:13.920]  First it talks about umbilical cords, getting stem cells from those for women's beauty products and gene therapies.
[00:09:14.281 --> 00:09:18.584]  But then later it admits that really the lion's share of it comes from aborted babies.
[00:09:19.464 --> 00:09:23.147]  And it has been in major British, French, and even U.S.
[00:09:23.187 --> 00:09:27.971]  newspapers, the Chinese government advertises it, that they melt down murdered
[00:09:29.016 --> 00:09:32.518]  Prisoners, but predominantly melted-down, aborted babies.
[00:09:33.359 --> 00:09:37.721]  Tens of millions, well a lot more than that a year, obviously aborted in China.
[00:09:38.182 --> 00:09:39.483]  It's a billion plus people.
[00:09:40.423 --> 00:09:49.409]  So it's an unknown number, but we know they do melt them down, render them down for their baby collagen, and women have it injected into their faces.
[00:09:49.829 --> 00:09:54.752]  Men do now, more and more of these, what's the term for men that do all that?
[00:09:54.892 --> 00:09:57.954]  Metro-sexual men who wear makeup,
[00:09:58.778 --> 00:10:04.302]  And get facials and get their nails done every week and prance around.
[00:10:05.062 --> 00:10:21.633]  It's just the decadent modern Roman men from the strongest and bravest and ready-to-go fighters and scientists and Nobel Prize winners we've turned into just a pathetic lot of scum.
[00:10:22.234 --> 00:10:25.616]  I'm sorry, I'm now digressing, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:43.311]  A barbaric kind of beauty clutching her Hermes holding bag under her arm, Susan Barrington, a 52-year-old housewife from Buckinghamshire, can't help smiling as she leaves the exclusive clinic in London's Wimpole Street.
[00:10:43.871 --> 00:10:52.477]  She has been given the final go-ahead to travel abroad for a cutting-edge, non-surgical treatment that promises to make her look 10 years younger.
[00:10:53.442 --> 00:11:03.229]  She doesn't care if the treatment is expensive, involves babies, and is so controversial that it is not allowed to be performed in England among her well-heeled friends.
[00:11:03.269 --> 00:11:06.111]  This is the ultimate new elixir of youth.
[00:11:06.191 --> 00:11:11.054]  By the way, this is all going on out in California right now and several other states.
[00:11:11.114 --> 00:11:15.217]  In fact, they are allowed to keep babies alive after birth.
[00:11:16.838 --> 00:11:17.559]  I'm not kidding.
[00:11:17.599 --> 00:11:18.660]  In several U.S.
[00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:19.100]  states,
[00:11:21.031 --> 00:11:28.617]  And they actually keep babies alive after birth, according to the laws they've gotten passed, for the extraction of certain fluids.
[00:11:29.957 --> 00:11:30.918]  You think I'm joking?
[00:11:30.978 --> 00:11:34.080]  I've had major heads of bioethics firms on.
[00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:38.443]  It's been in mainstream news that... What was the state now?
[00:11:38.464 --> 00:11:40.185]  We interviewed him twice, like, three years ago.
[00:11:42.366 --> 00:11:46.990]  And it was... I don't want to say... I know one of them was New Jersey.
[00:11:47.050 --> 00:11:48.651]  I think the other was Ohio.
[00:11:48.691 --> 00:11:50.252]  See, my memory fails me sometimes.
[00:11:51.144 --> 00:12:02.989]  Where actually in the law they got passed, they can quote, keep fetuses alive after term for experiments and for... It doesn't matter.
[00:12:03.029 --> 00:12:04.389]  It's all out of control.
[00:12:04.409 --> 00:12:06.530]  Well, it does matter.
[00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:10.352]  I'm just here speechless trying to scan my memory.
[00:12:11.392 --> 00:12:12.633]  We made a big deal out of it at the time.
[00:12:12.673 --> 00:12:18.795]  If any listeners remember the particular states and particular organizations and news articles we had on, call in.
[00:12:18.855 --> 00:12:20.216]  It'll pop in my head here in a minute.
[00:12:21.216 --> 00:12:29.940]  The attractive brunette has opted for a controversial stem cell therapy where umbilical cord tissue from newborn babies will be injected into her body.
[00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:31.301]  Now see how they say that?
[00:12:31.921 --> 00:12:35.943]  And then later you read in the article and it says actually from aborted babies.
[00:12:36.563 --> 00:12:47.348]  It may seem distasteful but thousands of women have already done it and it is organized by the seemingly respectable British clinic then carried out in Rotterdam, Holland where rules
[00:12:48.115 --> 00:12:51.317]  Regarding stem cell therapies are not so strict.
[00:12:52.578 --> 00:12:54.259]  And it goes on.
[00:12:54.639 --> 00:13:07.888]  Stem cell therapy has been big business for beauty doctors since medics discovered the strong healing and rejuvenating potential of stem cells for medical conditions such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.
[00:13:08.228 --> 00:13:11.090]  But there have also been furious ethical debate.
[00:13:11.490 --> 00:13:14.532]  It's also dangerous to just inject stem cells into yourself.
[00:13:14.552 --> 00:13:15.793]  It could trigger cancer.
[00:13:15.833 --> 00:13:16.694]  A lot of evidence shows
[00:13:17.390 --> 00:13:27.014]  In America, President Bush has announced stem cell therapy, even for medical purposes, as godless, vetoing any public funding through controversial vote.
[00:13:27.375 --> 00:13:31.196]  Controversially, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Governor of California, one of the few U.S.
[00:13:31.216 --> 00:13:35.198]  states to allow stem cell research, has allocated $80 million to it.
[00:13:35.538 --> 00:13:38.279]  Tony Blair met with him only last week to support the move.
[00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:46.223]  And I would add to implement global warming taxes in England and California, the seventh largest economy being California.
[00:13:48.749 --> 00:13:50.810]  And of course, Bush plays politics on this.
[00:13:50.850 --> 00:14:01.075]  He just said no federal funding for stem cells is a bone to the religious right, which I consider myself a member of.
[00:14:01.115 --> 00:14:07.539]  I mean, I'm a Christian, I'm against abortion, but Bush is just using this as a political football
[00:14:08.514 --> 00:14:17.437]  And the government is engaging in all sorts of classified and quasi-classified genetic engineering operations all over the U.S.
[00:14:17.937 --> 00:14:22.858]  and private corporations are doing it at an unlimited clip right now.
[00:14:23.678 --> 00:14:35.522]  The cloning of embryos, they then grow the embryos up to a certain size and then the babies and extract their quote stem cells, what's the term, a sanguination.
[00:14:36.552 --> 00:14:42.516]  As they basically suck them dry in a arachnid type procedure.
[00:14:44.318 --> 00:14:48.981]  And it just makes me very, very upset to see all of this going on.
[00:14:49.521 --> 00:14:55.866]  When injected, these powerful cells target the organs that are not functioning at their optimum and encourage them to produce new tissue.
[00:14:56.806 --> 00:15:04.752]  But scientists agree that further research is required to substantiate the claim that injecting stem cells can diminish wrinkles or reverse the signs of aging.
[00:15:06.118 --> 00:15:10.041]  In Britain, stem cell research is governed by strict ethical considerations.
[00:15:10.401 --> 00:15:17.485]  It is limited to registered institutions using cells from embryos up to 14 days old, or aborted fetuses donated to science.
[00:15:18.566 --> 00:15:19.907]  Oh, how nice of them!
[00:15:20.387 --> 00:15:27.712]  The restrictions in England are on the... They just keep it to dead babies.
[00:15:27.992 --> 00:15:30.874]  And growing them up in tanks.
[00:15:33.573 --> 00:15:34.553]  What is the restriction?
[00:15:34.593 --> 00:15:35.374]  That's unlimited.
[00:15:36.234 --> 00:15:47.418]  Such unregulated companies have mushroomed across the globe offering aesthetic stem cell therapies at exorbitant prices to anyone willing to pay.
[00:15:47.758 --> 00:15:56.882]  They claim that stem cells have the ability to rejuvenate the body and renew the cells, not just to produce younger, smoother skin, but increase sex drive and energy.
[00:16:01.494 --> 00:16:08.839]  And it just goes on with the 50-year-old woman saying, I don't care, I want to look good, and I think it's great and I don't care.
[00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:11.201]  And that's the attitude.
[00:16:11.981 --> 00:16:12.762]  That's the attitude.
[00:16:13.142 --> 00:16:28.273]  When the general public and the nouveau riche and the upper middle class, kind of the moron cousin of the elite, openly are saying, hey, give me aborted babies, give me their body parts,
[00:16:28.992 --> 00:16:33.084]  Is it any surprise we have China that when they arrest political dissidents...
[00:16:33.954 --> 00:17:00.298]  They genetically type their tissues, not just their blood type, and they warehouse you, and that's why the government of China can advertise to Japan, the US, Europe, Australia, anybody who's got the money, the elite of the world, travel to China, many times with their own physicians, and they go to these luxury facilities, these high-tech facilities, and they kill the prisoner,
[00:17:01.644 --> 00:17:24.666]  They will even in some cases transport the prisoner to the city where the elitist wants to have the surgery at one of the clinics and they will kill them and sometimes in a building right next door to the medical facility where they're going to have the transplant organs implanted, sutured into their bodies, attached, and they kill them and bring them over steaming hot and delicious.
[00:17:25.356 --> 00:17:38.707]  In fact, the Chinese Communist government advertises on their official transplantation websites that we've linked to in a bit of the mainstream news, that they quote in the American and English translation, it translates to, fresh organs!
[00:17:40.134 --> 00:17:44.518]  Of course, here, you've got to wait an average of a year for a kidney, a year and a half for a liver.
[00:17:44.898 --> 00:17:48.181]  Many people die waiting for them, and hospitals have been caught.
[00:17:48.201 --> 00:17:53.646]  I remember my dad telling me this, and I rolled my eyes when I was going to get my driver's license when I was 16.
[00:17:53.686 --> 00:17:56.329]  He said, son, say no on the organ donor card.
[00:17:56.909 --> 00:17:57.510]  And I said, why?
[00:17:57.550 --> 00:17:59.552]  And he just said, well, I know people in hospitals.
[00:18:00.606 --> 00:18:02.306]  My dad's an oral surgeon and dentist.
[00:18:02.366 --> 00:18:02.947]  He's a physician.
[00:18:03.267 --> 00:18:09.168]  He knows a lot of medical doctors and has worked in hospitals on reconstruction cases of jaws and other things.
[00:18:09.188 --> 00:18:12.188]  The point is, my dad said, don't.
[00:18:12.609 --> 00:18:16.789]  Some hospitals will let you die or in some cases kill you for your organs.
[00:18:17.450 --> 00:18:19.210]  And I remember going, man, my dad's nuts.
[00:18:19.630 --> 00:18:26.671]  And again, my dad isn't very outspoken and doesn't say a lot of wild things, but I still thought, he's nuts.
[00:18:26.731 --> 00:18:29.092]  And then, I guess it was about five years later,
[00:18:30.915 --> 00:18:37.778]  I'm watching 60 Minutes and they're talking about Chicago and Dallas and hospitals killing people for their organs caught red-handed.
[00:18:38.238 --> 00:18:40.699]  And I'm like, hmm, Dallas, what did my dad know?
[00:18:41.620 --> 00:18:44.861]  Son, don't say yes on the organ donor card.
[00:18:45.161 --> 00:18:53.084]  And now all over the country, states and the country of Canada are trying to make it to where you have to go in and tell them, no, no, no, you can't have my organs.
[00:18:53.324 --> 00:18:59.307]  See, they don't ask you now, you don't think about it, and they go ahead and put you on there as an organ donor.
[00:19:00.732 --> 00:19:01.613]  I'm digressing.
[00:19:01.673 --> 00:19:05.955]  My point here is that our government loves China.
[00:19:05.975 --> 00:19:07.056]  It gives them the awards.
[00:19:07.076 --> 00:19:08.097]  They're the model country.
[00:19:08.117 --> 00:19:08.537]  The U.N.
[00:19:08.557 --> 00:19:09.698]  gives them all the big awards.
[00:19:10.198 --> 00:19:11.138]  They are the model.
[00:19:11.158 --> 00:19:11.959]  They are the future.
[00:19:12.259 --> 00:19:14.180]  You want to know what life's going to be like here in the U.S.
[00:19:14.220 --> 00:19:15.221]  and England and Canada?
[00:19:15.681 --> 00:19:17.062]  It's going to be like it is in China.
[00:19:18.343 --> 00:19:26.768]  Mobile execution vans, mobile organ harvesting vans, if you have your second child and can't pay the bribes, they come openly.
[00:19:27.654 --> 00:19:31.597]  Well in the past they would drown your child in a bucket and give it back to you, your baby.
[00:19:32.038 --> 00:19:41.886]  Now they take them and kill the babies or keep them alive and then kill them right when their organs are needed for some elitist who needs a new liver for their baby.
[00:19:42.667 --> 00:19:44.809]  Oh yeah, I forgot about that part.
[00:19:45.029 --> 00:19:47.311]  There's evidence China is warehousing babies.
[00:19:48.031 --> 00:19:49.172]  And I'm sure they deserve it too.
[00:19:49.613 --> 00:19:50.113]  I understand.
[00:19:50.153 --> 00:19:51.034]  I'm a radical.
[00:19:51.374 --> 00:19:52.115]  I'm an extremist.
[00:19:53.243 --> 00:19:55.284]  Women, you need melted down dead babies?
[00:19:55.624 --> 00:19:56.205]  From China?
[00:19:56.585 --> 00:19:57.905]  For your big fat lips?
[00:19:57.965 --> 00:19:59.266]  Go ahead and enjoy yourselves!
[00:20:01.667 --> 00:20:04.109]  Your area has just unexpectedly flooded.
[00:20:04.309 --> 00:20:06.130]  The power is out, so is the water.
[00:20:06.310 --> 00:20:07.810]  And you are thirsty.
[00:20:07.890 --> 00:20:08.991]  But wait outside.
[00:20:09.031 --> 00:20:10.532]  Look, there's lots of water.
[00:20:10.792 --> 00:20:12.233]  And then you see it.
[00:20:12.393 --> 00:20:13.693]  Oh my gosh!
[00:20:14.013 --> 00:20:15.954]  What is that floating in the water?
[00:20:16.475 --> 00:20:18.616]  And what is that odor?
[00:20:19.196 --> 00:20:19.957]  No problem.
[00:20:20.157 --> 00:20:23.441]  You thought ahead and own a Berkey water purification system.
[00:20:23.581 --> 00:20:27.385]  Berkey has revolutionized the way water is purified simply and naturally.
[00:20:27.506 --> 00:20:33.713]  Requiring no power, electricity, or water pressure, the powerful black Berkey elements extract pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites,
[00:20:34.053 --> 00:20:34.373]  I think so.
[00:21:00.768 --> 00:21:01.748]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[00:21:01.829 --> 00:21:06.611]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve Note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[00:21:06.771 --> 00:21:14.574]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[00:21:14.834 --> 00:21:20.217]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[00:21:20.417 --> 00:21:27.400]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:33.022]  A current effort is underway by the Fed along with other central banks to increase liquidity for depositors.
[00:21:33.282 --> 00:21:38.004]  However, an increase in money supply without equal expansion in productivity can cause inflation.
[00:21:38.364 --> 00:21:45.947]  In order to achieve strength and stability, I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver.
[00:21:46.287 --> 00:21:52.549]  While paper investments currently have been driven by debt, gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years.
[00:21:52.849 --> 00:21:56.370]  For more information, call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:56.710 --> 00:21:57.291]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:57.391 --> 00:22:03.152]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:22:03.833 --> 00:22:10.475]  Did you know there's an assault upon America's freedom of religion by the United Nations Genocide Convention Treaty?
[00:22:11.655 --> 00:22:13.896]  The laws are called hate crime laws.
[00:22:14.756 --> 00:22:21.001]  These laws will eventually shut down Christianity in America by accusing Christians of hate crimes.
[00:22:21.882 --> 00:22:29.988]  These laws are already being used in Canada, Britain, Australia, and Sweden against Christians for reading certain Bible passages.
[00:22:31.009 --> 00:22:38.875]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[00:22:39.736 --> 00:22:41.237]  Just call our toll-free number 1-800
[00:22:43.183 --> 00:22:43.203]  516-8736.
[00:22:43.283 --> 00:22:43.583]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[00:22:43.623 --> 00:22:43.904]  Call now.
[00:22:43.944 --> 00:22:46.146]  Operators are standing by to receive your call.
[00:22:59.972 --> 00:23:05.956]  I used to be ashamed of my toenails, so I thought I was destined to wear tennis shoes through the heat of the summer and hide my toes at the beach.
[00:23:06.376 --> 00:23:09.038]  And then my podiatrist told me about Non-X Nail Gel.
[00:23:09.198 --> 00:23:13.821]  It tackles unsightly nails by clearing out the cause of the problem, yellowing keratin debris buildup.
[00:23:13.981 --> 00:23:18.805]  With regular use, Non-X Gel breaks down and removes the debris, so toenails look clear.
[00:23:18.985 --> 00:23:23.708]  This summer I'm wearing open-toed sandals again, thanks to a topical natural gel called Non-X.
[00:23:23.928 --> 00:23:26.630]  If your toenails are embarrassing, I recommend Non-X Nail Gel.
[00:23:26.830 --> 00:23:29.732]  It's at your pharmacy or mass retailer in the foot care section.
[00:23:31.012 --> 00:23:32.033]  Looking for profits?
[00:23:32.093 --> 00:23:33.473]  Looking for safety and security?
[00:23:33.813 --> 00:23:37.034]  The $10 Olympic commemorative gold coin offers both.
[00:23:37.074 --> 00:23:44.636]  This low mintage collector coin with a total series mintage under $600,000 has sold at four times its current price.
[00:23:44.696 --> 00:23:48.217]  Falling dollar values and inflation make this likely to happen again.
[00:23:48.457 --> 00:23:49.978]  Secure your position today.
[00:23:50.278 --> 00:23:51.458]  Call Midas Resources at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:23:51.538 --> 00:23:51.778]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:24:08.867 --> 00:24:32.661]  Alright, I'm going to get into 9-11, get into the latest Israel World War III provocation, but just on the subject of decadence, when the men are getting collagen injections of the melted down baby oils, collagen, when the women are getting $10,000 plus a pop
[00:24:35.426 --> 00:25:03.984]  injections of dead baby cells into them of aborted babies and the main supplier is China through France when all of this is going on it's just it's just unbelievable I mean we've rationalized 47 to 50 million abortions in this country millions of them third trimester babies that could be adopted they don't even tell those women that
[00:25:04.614 --> 00:25:08.397]  There are foundations that will pay them to go ahead and have the baby and give it up for adoption.
[00:25:08.737 --> 00:25:21.287]  And the so-called liberals, the Malthusian, Pionkian, Nazi types will sit up there and call themselves progressive like Hitler did and say, well nobody wants all these babies!
[00:25:21.307 --> 00:25:24.430]  Did you know there's actually more people wanting to adopt each year?
[00:25:25.350 --> 00:25:27.673]  And there are actual abortions in this country.
[00:25:27.753 --> 00:25:34.020]  There's just a little bit more people that want to adopt each year than for the national number of abortions we have.
[00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:41.709]  People wait three years to, you know, get black babies, white babies, it doesn't matter.
[00:25:42.818 --> 00:25:54.329]  And I just can't tell you how many times in college we'd be debating this and the liberals would stand up, and they're not really liberals at all, those terms mean nothing, but they're liberals to themselves and say, nobody wants these little brown babies, Alex!
[00:25:54.569 --> 00:25:56.330]  Why don't you adopt some then?
[00:25:56.811 --> 00:26:00.895]  Well, I've got to be honest with you, someday I may adopt children.
[00:26:00.935 --> 00:26:02.076]  I love children so much.
[00:26:02.696 --> 00:26:05.699]  You can really see God's handiwork stamped on them.
[00:26:06.460 --> 00:26:12.345]  And who knows, someday when I'm done having more children of my own, I might just adopt.
[00:26:13.225 --> 00:26:13.526]  You know?
[00:26:13.546 --> 00:26:15.887]  For people that love children, that's what you do.
[00:26:16.128 --> 00:26:21.272]  I just don't... I've talked to abortionists, former abortionists, and you just don't know.
[00:26:21.652 --> 00:26:28.377]  So many people have had abortions or been involved in abortions, so you harden your heart, you rationalize, you tell yourself it's okay what you did.
[00:26:28.957 --> 00:26:33.381]  If you'll just admit to yourself that what you've done is wrong, and ask God to forgive you,
[00:26:34.276 --> 00:26:37.418]  And turn against this type of hard-heartedness.
[00:26:38.198 --> 00:26:42.060]  You can forgive yourself and God can forgive you and you'll stop feeling bad.
[00:26:43.460 --> 00:26:45.221]  But now look what it leads to.
[00:26:45.321 --> 00:26:58.047]  The nouveau riche women and metrosexual men going and getting their gene therapy weekly injections of the dead babies.
[00:26:59.773 --> 00:27:02.395]  And oh, it makes them feel so good.
[00:27:02.756 --> 00:27:04.817]  How is that different from the Dark Crystal?
[00:27:04.837 --> 00:27:14.305]  Ever seen that science fiction movie where these evil creatures suck the souls out of these other little people they kidnap and, you know, sit there and drink their essence?
[00:27:14.385 --> 00:27:17.788]  I mean, that's what we've become as a society.
[00:27:17.808 --> 00:27:25.755]  I ought to get a clip from that movie where they're, ah, yes, mmm, oh, I can feel it, give it to me.
[00:27:27.205 --> 00:27:38.928]  This is just another indication of the just out-of-control disconnect by the upper middle class and the elite and the ultra-elite of this world.
[00:27:41.148 --> 00:27:54.111]  And so if a millionaire housewife will go and get $10,000 injections of dead baby cells, what will
[00:27:55.100 --> 00:27:56.581]  David Rockefeller do.
[00:27:56.621 --> 00:28:10.310]  You know, David Rockefeller doesn't want you to have access to the life extension technologies they've already developed that can extend life easily, if it started early enough, to 200 years.
[00:28:10.330 --> 00:28:11.231]  140 currently.
[00:28:12.231 --> 00:28:15.994]  In fact, I've seen a lot of evidences and a lot of leaks and slip-ups.
[00:28:17.101 --> 00:28:26.465]  By top scientists and billionaires that currently members of the elite are staging their own deaths.
[00:28:27.205 --> 00:28:33.547]  Because it's getting a little too obvious at 95 years old when they're running around still playing golf.
[00:28:35.348 --> 00:28:38.849]  And we know that a lot of them are taking these gene therapies.
[00:28:38.869 --> 00:28:39.650]  They are doing this.
[00:28:39.990 --> 00:28:41.991]  And that's why they want to reduce the world population.
[00:28:42.311 --> 00:28:45.252]  Because they know they can't keep these secrets from getting out forever.
[00:28:45.896 --> 00:28:53.322]  And they know that they obviously, in their own words, cannot give life extension to 6.5 billion people.
[00:28:53.822 --> 00:28:58.025]  It will be 8 billion people by the time this stuff is commonly known and common knowledge.
[00:28:58.525 --> 00:29:03.809]  And so that's why they constantly have cures for cancer, constantly have new therapies, new things that are, you know, 90%, 100%.
[00:29:04.810 --> 00:29:06.051]  You never hear about them again.
[00:29:06.671 --> 00:29:11.995]  They get shelled, they get taken to the clinics in Germany and the clinics in Switzerland and the clinics in London.
[00:29:12.336 --> 00:29:15.358]  And it's all kept very, very quiet.
[00:29:18.740 --> 00:29:24.023]  And they can't save people 100% of the time, they can't cure every cancer, but they've gotten really good at it.
[00:29:25.524 --> 00:29:30.928]  And they don't want you to have access to that or any of the other advanced technologies that have been developed.
[00:29:32.309 --> 00:29:38.773]  And so that's where the Pionkian, let's kill 90% of the population, mindset comes from.
[00:29:39.620 --> 00:29:48.868]  Because the elite, obviously, need to manage things and run things, and the elite and their servants will be given these extensions, but no one else!
[00:29:49.028 --> 00:29:50.490]  And they have to be kept in the dark about it!

[00:33:05.968 --> 00:33:11.192]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:13.034 --> 00:33:19.759]  Dustin in Germany, John, Jason, James, Ben, people all over the nation, Canada.
[00:33:20.500 --> 00:33:30.628]  We'll get to your calls here in just a few minutes, but I thought I'd play this news clip first because this dovetails
[00:33:31.681 --> 00:33:50.999]  With the decadence, the self-centeredness, people only caring about themselves, and, oh, I don't care if it makes me mutable for my vanity, then let me have aborted babies from China, rendered down for their genetics, or rendered down for their tissues.
[00:33:52.020 --> 00:33:53.601]  Well, this dovetails with it.
[00:33:53.641 --> 00:33:54.482]  Go ahead and roll it.
[00:33:55.287 --> 00:33:59.608]  Pedestrian run over and killed after being struck by three vehicles.
[00:34:00.209 --> 00:34:03.350]  And Orlando police say no one stopped to help.
[00:34:03.670 --> 00:34:08.671]  It happened at around midnight on Orange Blossom Trail near Silver Star Road.
[00:34:08.731 --> 00:34:10.972]  The driver was in a silver Dodge Durango.
[00:34:11.092 --> 00:34:15.633]  He drove away, but while the man's body was in the street, two more cars ran over him.
[00:34:16.093 --> 00:34:20.675]  Police weren't able to identify the victim, but are still searching for the driver of the Durango.
[00:34:23.681 --> 00:34:38.245]  Now remember, last week I talked about the murder of Charles Whitman, killing 14 people from the UT Tower, injuring 33, after he gunned down his mother and his wife.
[00:34:39.545 --> 00:34:50.568]  Well, I then went through a few other examples, and I told you that I see these stories every week where a woman is raped in downtown Toronto, in a nice part of town,
[00:34:52.245 --> 00:35:14.274]  She lays there naked on the sidewalk for several hours with her head beaten in, crawling around, blood on the ground, and a big telecom company's right there, and the head of the office gets up there on the third floor and tells everybody, laughs at her, and tells everybody, stop looking, get back to work, we don't have time to talk to the cops.
[00:35:15.575 --> 00:35:18.836]  And people for hours just walked by her.
[00:35:19.668 --> 00:35:22.111]  And I see these reports every single week.
[00:35:22.171 --> 00:35:23.793]  It's happened right here in Austin, Texas.
[00:35:25.115 --> 00:35:26.557]  I've experienced it myself.
[00:35:26.617 --> 00:35:27.738]  I've seen people in trouble.
[00:35:29.400 --> 00:35:32.044]  I've been driving down the road and seen smoke way up ahead of me.
[00:35:32.950 --> 00:35:46.216]  On the highway, and I get up there five minutes later, and a car is on fire, and a family's had a wreck, and they've just barely gotten their kids out of the car because they're injured, and I get out and the police come, and the police thank me for stopping.
[00:35:46.676 --> 00:35:52.379]  There is a law in Texas, the Good Samaritan law, you have to help people, but I don't need a law to do it.
[00:35:52.699 --> 00:35:54.239]  But people just drive by.
[00:35:54.319 --> 00:35:55.340]  They don't help.
[00:35:57.105 --> 00:35:59.366]  We weren't like this 50 years ago, folks.
[00:35:59.886 --> 00:36:01.567]  We weren't like this 100 years ago.
[00:36:01.647 --> 00:36:04.989]  It was rare that people didn't get involved and didn't help.
[00:36:06.590 --> 00:36:17.776]  But then again, we hadn't had 50 million abortions, we hadn't rationalized that one, and now it's on to Chinese murder dissidence organs, and dead baby collagen, and genetic
[00:36:19.751 --> 00:36:23.973]  Gene therapy for the women, and it's just, this is who we've turned into.
[00:36:24.313 --> 00:36:28.816]  You know, when you only care about yourself, well, then no one cares about you.
[00:36:29.176 --> 00:36:45.404]  Everybody else is like that, I guess, to a great extent now, and so no one cares about anyone, and it ends up destroying our quality of life, destroying the type of society we live in, and it allows criminals to come in and take over government and start abusing your neighbors, and you don't care about them.
[00:36:45.504 --> 00:36:46.505]  After all, it's not you.
[00:36:46.845 --> 00:36:48.906]  So when you're getting abused, then
[00:36:49.941 --> 00:36:51.342]  No one comes to your aid.
[00:36:52.964 --> 00:37:05.956]  That's how they can put cancer viruses and vaccines and mercury and that's how they can kill hundreds of thousands of hemophiliacs by putting AIDS and hepatitis in it on purpose and that's how they can just get up there and do everything they do because people only care about themselves.
[00:37:06.016 --> 00:37:07.818]  I've talked to so many yuppies you know who
[00:37:07.858 --> 00:37:30.646]  Who drive the Jaguars and live in the downtown high-rise apartment and they're biking every day and they're feeling good and I've known some of them that get in car wrecks and get real hurt and then their family hardly even comes to visit them and all their trendy friends aren't there and you know you just see these people but over the years they'll laugh and giggle at me and okay it's all true Alex what are you going to do?
[00:37:30.666 --> 00:37:35.508]  You just got to worry about yourself and try to work the system and try to get ahead.
[00:37:36.778 --> 00:37:43.604]  You people don't have forgotten and have never even discovered, maybe never even knew, what life is really all about.
[00:37:46.306 --> 00:37:51.831]  I mean, Americans in the past were savage, were strong, were violent, were aggressive, were warlike.
[00:37:53.332 --> 00:37:58.337]  But, you know, we didn't have statements out of our presidents and our leaders like, let's just kill
[00:38:01.113 --> 00:38:01.974]  All of our enemies.
[00:38:02.014 --> 00:38:04.036]  Let's just kill all their children.
[00:38:04.096 --> 00:38:13.025]  No, we weren't perfect in war, but we have the highest standards in our military history of not killing civilians, of not torturing, of not raping.
[00:38:13.806 --> 00:38:15.267]  Well, now we're the worst!
[00:38:15.627 --> 00:38:17.069]  The worst in modern history!
[00:38:18.650 --> 00:38:20.312]  You see, we're changing.
[00:38:21.483 --> 00:38:29.710]  A decadent people, riding around in their cars, listening to talk radio, going, yeah, kill all the Arabs, turn them into a parking lot!
[00:38:30.070 --> 00:38:46.344]  And I get on the air and I say, you know, that's not right, and there's two sides to this, and this is more complex, and the neocons want World War III, and they want to turn America into a police state, and then I get calls on air, going, you're nothing but a traitor, and you need to be off the air, and you need to be arrested!
[00:38:50.189 --> 00:38:52.911]  Just because I know a little bit of history and I've studied what's going on.
[00:38:53.491 --> 00:38:55.853]  And so that happened yesterday.
[00:38:58.374 --> 00:39:00.235]  Imagine, busy thoroughfare.
[00:39:00.255 --> 00:39:01.076]  There's video of it.
[00:39:01.096 --> 00:39:02.236]  You can go watch the newscast.
[00:39:03.417 --> 00:39:04.658]  Somebody hits this guy.
[00:39:05.158 --> 00:39:07.059]  He is in pieces.
[00:39:07.119 --> 00:39:08.180]  It knocks his head off.
[00:39:09.641 --> 00:39:11.882]  That's how hard he got hit when the car runs over him.
[00:39:12.343 --> 00:39:16.425]  And other cars are just come by and run over the body and just don't even stop.
[00:39:16.485 --> 00:39:17.886]  Oh, I'm running over a dead body!
[00:39:19.343 --> 00:39:23.846]  I mean, it's one thing with a criminal that hit and run, but again, why are there so many hit and runs today?
[00:39:24.786 --> 00:39:26.628]  Because people are in denial.
[00:39:26.648 --> 00:39:31.571]  They're just, oh, that didn't happen, there's not blood all over my windshield, that person didn't just go flying over my windshield.
[00:39:31.791 --> 00:39:47.581]  You've heard about the cases, it's happened a bunch of times, where the person will fly up over the top of the truck and be in the back of the truck, or they'll fly through the windshield and be lodged in the car, and these people just go home and just let them die!
[00:39:48.953 --> 00:39:50.234]  Because they're in denial.
[00:39:50.274 --> 00:39:51.455]  They don't know what to do.
[00:39:51.795 --> 00:39:53.396]  Something real happened to them.
[00:39:54.116 --> 00:39:55.737]  So they've never been criminals before.
[00:39:56.758 --> 00:40:00.020]  And if they'd have just stopped, no one would have gotten in trouble.
[00:40:00.060 --> 00:40:01.521]  The person was out in the middle of the street.
[00:40:02.581 --> 00:40:04.422]  But no, no, they don't do that.
[00:40:04.743 --> 00:40:07.584]  They run off, they scurry off to their little holes.
[00:40:08.145 --> 00:40:12.107]  Again, we had an Austin police officer who was hit, I guess it was about 5 or 6 years ago.
[00:40:13.108 --> 00:40:17.110]  And he bled to death for over 45 minutes in the street and could have been saved.
[00:40:19.082 --> 00:40:27.585]  People, hundreds of cars, in broad daylight, in the morning, drove by, and it wasn't until a policeman came by that they got any help.
[00:40:29.265 --> 00:40:34.767]  So you wonder why even in the 60's this trend had started, why the cops were running away from the tower sniper?
[00:40:34.787 --> 00:40:36.368]  Because they didn't want to die!
[00:40:37.908 --> 00:40:39.429]  They weren't just cowards.
[00:40:40.069 --> 00:40:45.531]  It was the citizens out there shooting back at them predominantly, and then a few good cops and citizens who had courage that went up there.
[00:40:47.626 --> 00:40:52.769]  It was the citizens that took action, and it was the police that ran in fear.
[00:40:53.730 --> 00:40:54.190]  And why?
[00:40:57.893 --> 00:41:01.315]  I don't even know if you have a choice whether you're a coward or not.
[00:41:01.375 --> 00:41:08.159]  Maybe it's genetic, because I don't even see a courage factor in the equation of somebody killing innocent people.
[00:41:08.520 --> 00:41:11.822]  You, as a warrior, as a man, you go and you kill them.
[00:41:13.112 --> 00:41:26.799]  See, people think it's extraordinary to get up on the air at the risk of my life and expose 9-11 as an inside job and take these people on head-on, knowing full well it's a 50-50 chance they're going to grace me sooner rather than later.
[00:41:28.900 --> 00:41:30.681]  But people are like, well, how do you deal with that?
[00:41:30.721 --> 00:41:33.442]  How do you deal with knowing they can drop the hammer on you any day?
[00:41:33.862 --> 00:41:35.623]  Well, I mean, how do you do anything?
[00:41:36.044 --> 00:41:42.707]  How did our forefathers move west with their families on wagon trains through passages that have never been opened?
[00:41:43.900 --> 00:41:49.721]  How did we come across the ocean on sailing ships when they were losing, in many cases, about 8% of the ships?
[00:41:51.422 --> 00:41:54.843]  I mean, how did Lief Erikson discover the Americas?
[00:41:54.883 --> 00:42:02.024]  How did the Mesoamerican Aboriginal population come across the Bering Straits when it was so dangerous?
[00:42:03.785 --> 00:42:05.425]  I mean, how does any of this happen?
[00:42:08.146 --> 00:42:13.287]  How does an astronaut get in an experimental rocket when, you know, a third of them are blowing up on the pad?
[00:42:16.815 --> 00:42:20.877]  How does a test pilot get in a jet and break the sound barrier?
[00:42:23.399 --> 00:42:25.480]  I mean, how do you get in your car every day and drive to work?
[00:42:25.500 --> 00:42:27.501]  The most dangerous thing you do is drive in that car.
[00:42:27.561 --> 00:42:28.642]  That takes real courage!
[00:42:30.683 --> 00:42:32.184]  I've assessed the dangers in my life.
[00:42:32.624 --> 00:42:36.086]  And I've made the decision that it's worth it to stand up against these people.
[00:42:36.766 --> 00:42:37.947]  And I don't want to get off into preaching.
[00:42:37.967 --> 00:42:38.948]  I said I'd go to your calls.
[00:42:39.588 --> 00:42:44.791]  It's just... I mean, how do you sit there and run over somebody
[00:42:45.507 --> 00:42:49.029]  And then people that didn't even run over them drive by and don't help them.
[00:42:49.669 --> 00:42:54.372]  How do you run over a cop and then drive off and then everybody else drives by and, ooh, that's a cop.
[00:42:54.752 --> 00:42:56.693]  I better not help him because I might get in trouble.
[00:42:56.713 --> 00:43:00.235]  I mean, again, I've seen it over and over again in my life.
[00:43:03.232 --> 00:43:09.217]  There are people who will sit in their houses when their house is on fire just because there's some fire down the hall.
[00:43:09.277 --> 00:43:10.398]  They've got a way to get out.
[00:43:10.678 --> 00:43:17.664]  They will sit there waiting on the fire department, too afraid because there's a fire down the hall, instead of just getting out while they can.
[00:43:17.924 --> 00:43:21.827]  And then firefighters have got to go in and save them when they're surrounded by flames.
[00:43:22.127 --> 00:43:29.754]  And then they're in such a catatonic state, the firefighters have got to carry them physically out through the flames wrapped in a blanket.
[00:43:30.674 --> 00:43:32.636]  We didn't act like this in the past!
[00:43:33.266 --> 00:43:45.651]  We've been engineered with the television and the drugs and the media and the stuff in our water and food, I believe a lot of it's chemical now, to be like guinea pigs that sit there in a cage.
[00:43:47.051 --> 00:43:57.835]  You know, when a boa constrictor is put in there with them and the guinea pig doesn't fight or doesn't run, it just sits there and lays over on its back for the snake to come over and eat it.
[00:43:57.915 --> 00:44:02.397]  And listen folks, I'm not a bug-eyed guinea pig or chinchilla.
[00:44:03.476 --> 00:44:04.777]  I'm certainly not a sheep.
[00:44:05.258 --> 00:44:07.020]  Have you ever seen a sheep getting eaten by wolves?
[00:44:07.060 --> 00:44:08.021]  I've seen films of it.
[00:44:08.681 --> 00:44:13.086]  I've seen what they've done to sheep and cows and what coyotes have done.
[00:44:13.126 --> 00:44:14.107]  I've seen the aftermath.
[00:44:15.568 --> 00:44:18.231]  But at least cows circle the wagons and fight back.
[00:44:19.032 --> 00:44:25.739]  When the coyotes really get them is when they get stuck in a trough or get stuck in the mud and the coyotes come and eat their backside.
[00:44:29.454 --> 00:44:35.398]  But a sheep or a wolf or a coyote runs up to it, rolls right over, and just sits there waiting for death.
[00:44:36.018 --> 00:44:44.664]  And the coyote will really kind of enjoy, because they're predatory, they enjoy the pain of their victims, they will start eating them from the intestines in.
[00:44:44.684 --> 00:44:46.685]  Because that has the most nutrition in it.
[00:44:48.846 --> 00:44:52.808]  We humans like muscle meat, but predators go for the guts first.
[00:44:53.609 --> 00:44:56.831]  And that soup in there, it's kind of like a casserole.
[00:44:58.229 --> 00:45:04.777]  And that sheep will just roll over, and it'll just roll over and let that wolf eat its guts.
[00:45:05.477 --> 00:45:08.220]  Folks, that's how we act now, and we are not sheep.
[00:45:08.981 --> 00:45:09.262]  Okay?
[00:45:09.282 --> 00:45:15.148]  We are the super predator that has dominated this planet, and I don't know what's wrong with you.
[00:45:16.410 --> 00:45:17.431]  I don't understand it.
[00:45:18.234 --> 00:45:29.799]  I mean, if you know the things I know, you know this stuff's true, you're informed, you should be violently angry, crazed like I am, with your eyes bulging out, half the time showing your teeth.
[00:45:30.099 --> 00:45:31.400]  That's what I do around here in the office.
[00:45:31.420 --> 00:45:32.861]  I mean, this is a war!
[00:45:33.061 --> 00:45:35.502]  We are waging war against criminals!
[00:45:35.682 --> 00:45:37.143]  We are going to smash them!
[00:45:37.483 --> 00:45:40.184]  Some wolf comes up to me, and I'm a primitive?
[00:45:40.244 --> 00:45:42.405]  I'm gonna jab a big ol' spear in its eye!
[00:45:43.180 --> 00:45:46.382]  And if it gets a hold of me, I'm gonna grab it, and I'm gonna choke it, and I'm gonna bite it!
[00:45:46.402 --> 00:45:50.285]  And I'm gonna take its head, and I'm gonna start slamming it into the concrete!
[00:45:50.825 --> 00:45:53.287]  I'm gonna slam it with a big ol' rock upside the head!
[00:45:53.567 --> 00:45:58.630]  I am not gonna roll over while a pack of wolves eats my wife and eats my children!
[00:45:58.650 --> 00:46:01.572]  I am gonna go in there, and I'm gonna kill them!
[00:46:04.378 --> 00:46:06.680]  And in the information war, that's what we're doing.
[00:46:06.780 --> 00:46:14.686]  Every time we wake up a new person, every time we get the truth out, every time, I literally image it as their capital ships on fire!
[00:46:15.207 --> 00:46:20.131]  And we are just firing our guns at them, having victory after victory, smashing them!
[00:46:20.151 --> 00:46:22.533]  And we're gonna smash the New World Order!
[00:46:22.693 --> 00:46:23.874]  We're coming for ya!
[00:46:26.756 --> 00:46:28.858]  Dustin in Germany, thanks for holding her on the air.
[00:46:28.898 --> 00:46:29.318]  Go ahead.
[00:46:29.898 --> 00:46:31.440]  Hey Alex, how you doing brother?
[00:46:31.560 --> 00:46:31.760]  Good.
[00:46:32.719 --> 00:46:35.021]  Hey, uh, I got a technical question for you.
[00:46:36.702 --> 00:46:48.931]  A while ago, about seven plus weeks or so ago, I ordered a movie and a t-shirt, and my partner Thomas over here, man, he ordered some t-shirts and stuff.
[00:46:48.951 --> 00:46:50.773]  You know, we're all the way over here in Germany.
[00:46:51.380 --> 00:46:55.042]  You know, fighting a good fight like you said, Alex.
[00:46:55.102 --> 00:46:58.804]  And you haven't gotten your stuff and you'd like me to do some customer service here on air.
[00:46:58.904 --> 00:47:02.545]  Sure, I'm ready to help you.
[00:47:03.066 --> 00:47:04.706]  I've dealt with y'all before.
[00:47:04.746 --> 00:47:07.788]  I mean, I got Road to Tyranny.
[00:47:07.888 --> 00:47:09.028]  I got Martial Law.
[00:47:09.409 --> 00:47:10.829]  I passed them out, you know.
[00:47:11.229 --> 00:47:12.590]  We're waking people up over here.
[00:47:12.650 --> 00:47:15.932]  Everybody at my work, you know, we burn copies and all that.
[00:47:17.232 --> 00:47:18.693]  And, you know, it's just...
[00:47:19.818 --> 00:47:27.184]  Yeah, I'd like to get TerraStorm, but I'd appreciate it if it got here before we all got nuked.
[00:47:27.265 --> 00:47:28.005]  You know what I'm saying?
[00:47:29.046 --> 00:47:30.768]  Listen, I totally agree with you.
[00:47:31.088 --> 00:47:34.111]  How can I serve you here on air, customer service, right now?
[00:47:34.151 --> 00:47:34.571]  Let's do it.
[00:47:34.791 --> 00:47:37.173]  Customer service line, right here on the radio, right now.
[00:47:37.253 --> 00:47:37.994]  What can I do for you?
[00:47:39.713 --> 00:47:49.342]  Well, I mean, uh, well, you know, uh, conspiracy theorists, uh, quote-unquote, are, uh, you know, a paranoid lot, so, uh... Well, there's no conspiracy about it.
[00:47:49.402 --> 00:47:53.826]  I can tell you what's... You know, I mean, you know how it is.
[00:47:54.146 --> 00:47:57.289]  So let me give you, let me give you a number, and we're trying our best.
[00:47:58.160 --> 00:48:01.002]  To expand the amount of voicemail on it.
[00:48:01.102 --> 00:48:02.203]  It gets filled up a lot.
[00:48:03.104 --> 00:48:04.885]  But let me give you a number you can call.
[00:48:05.286 --> 00:48:07.527]  Or let me give you an email you can email.
[00:48:07.848 --> 00:48:14.192]  For customer service issues, you can email Kevin at InfoWars.com.
[00:48:14.953 --> 00:48:17.935]  Kevin at InfoWars.com.
[00:48:19.176 --> 00:48:21.198]  Or you can simply call 512.
[00:48:23.651 --> 00:48:27.375]  512-291-5750 and I appreciate your call.
[00:48:27.395 --> 00:48:28.356]  512-291-5750.
[00:48:28.456 --> 00:48:42.548]  We haven't gotten these calls on air about customer service in years because we, the last few years, have gotten it to where we generally ship within one day of getting the order.
[00:48:43.489 --> 00:48:46.492]  Unless it's United States Postal Service.
[00:48:47.552 --> 00:48:55.076]  In the last two years most of our problems have ended because we started using UPS or United Parcel Service.
[00:48:57.117 --> 00:49:05.041]  Well, for international we have continued to use the mail because it's much cheaper and we don't want to charge you the huge amounts it is overseas.
[00:49:05.061 --> 00:49:06.041]  We're trying to save you money.
[00:49:07.442 --> 00:49:08.783]  Though I made the decision last week
[00:49:09.958 --> 00:49:13.700]  To go to, I guess, DHL, UPS or FedEx.
[00:49:13.720 --> 00:49:15.060]  We may give you all three choices.
[00:49:15.581 --> 00:49:28.026]  Overseas is going to cost you a lot more because I can announce and tell you that the postman came in here and told us that for months they have been doing this without telling us and it has been devastating to our business.
[00:49:28.546 --> 00:49:30.387]  I wasn't going to mention this on air, but I'll go ahead and do it.
[00:49:31.287 --> 00:49:36.930]  Almost every package that's been shipped to England, Canada, Germany, Australia,
[00:49:37.771 --> 00:49:40.716]  He is taken to the new Homeland Security x-ray facility.
[00:49:41.610 --> 00:49:53.715]  And they are destroying and throwing away almost all of our packages if, quote, a postman doesn't certify it at the local branch here in Austin and certify it and say that they, quote, vouch for it.
[00:49:53.815 --> 00:50:10.721]  So they read the mail, they tear it all up and they trash it and they are doing this and so hundreds of packages and now we just wait till you call and then we lose the money, ship it all again, get your address and try to ship to you globally with UPS.
[00:50:12.316 --> 00:50:16.518]  And any profits we've made, we haven't made enough profits yet to pay off Terror Storm.
[00:50:16.898 --> 00:50:18.319]  This is exciting talk radio.
[00:50:18.599 --> 00:50:21.320]  Now called Customer Service Talk Radio.
[00:50:21.420 --> 00:50:22.661]  We can do this.
[00:50:22.721 --> 00:50:23.281]  We can do this.
[00:50:23.821 --> 00:50:25.902]  We can't handle the customer service calls here at the office.
[00:50:25.922 --> 00:50:27.543]  We'll handle them right here on air.
[00:50:27.863 --> 00:50:28.783]  Customer Service 1-800-259-9231.
[00:50:28.803 --> 00:50:33.746]  And you can call us right here.
[00:50:33.786 --> 00:50:34.886]  We'll handle it right here on air.
[00:50:34.926 --> 00:50:35.927]  I'm serious when I say that.
[00:50:37.147 --> 00:50:38.588]  We will do it right here on air.
[00:50:39.688 --> 00:50:40.929]  But we are
[00:50:41.946 --> 00:50:44.730]  Now up to shipping about two or three days after we get an order.
[00:50:45.931 --> 00:50:47.273]  We've caught back up since the L.A.
[00:50:47.293 --> 00:50:47.714]  Conference.
[00:50:48.114 --> 00:50:51.859]  But we are completely going to stop using United States Postal Service.
[00:50:53.021 --> 00:50:56.205]  Because, which means we won't be able to deliver to post office boxes anymore.
[00:50:56.665 --> 00:50:57.787]  Because they are criminal.
[00:51:03.328 --> 00:51:06.489]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[00:51:06.849 --> 00:51:08.789]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[00:51:09.149 --> 00:51:16.811]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:17.491 --> 00:51:24.532]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:51:24.933 --> 00:51:31.814]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying,
[00:51:32.324 --> 00:51:36.385]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:51:36.665 --> 00:51:40.165]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:51:40.646 --> 00:51:42.546]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:51:42.886 --> 00:51:46.787]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:52:00.333 --> 00:52:03.937]  As snow falls on the majestic Rocky Mountains, it eventually melts.
[00:52:04.137 --> 00:52:10.064]  The water east of the continental divide travels downhill over 1,600 miles before reaching the Atlantic Ocean.
[00:52:10.224 --> 00:52:14.949]  On the western side, water travels downhill almost 1,000 miles to reach the Pacific Ocean.
[00:52:15.129 --> 00:52:17.732]  As you ponder this miracle, ask yourself this question.
[00:52:18.012 --> 00:52:22.117]  How many people and animals has that water passed through before it reaches my area?
[00:52:22.538 --> 00:52:26.542]  Berkey has revolutionized the way water is purified, simply, internationally.
[00:52:26.723 --> 00:52:30.347]  At the heart of these portable systems are the Black Berkey purification elements.
[00:52:30.527 --> 00:52:36.254]  So powerful, these elements extract pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, heavy metals, and yet...
[00:52:36.574 --> 00:52:37.215]  We're good to go!
[00:53:00.982 --> 00:53:01.322]  I think so.
[00:53:16.209 --> 00:53:16.869]  We're good to go!
[00:53:45.746 --> 00:53:48.827]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[00:53:48.987 --> 00:53:54.968]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[00:54:07.711 --> 00:54:09.171]  Welcome back ladies and gentlemen.
[00:54:09.491 --> 00:54:12.672]  Just continuing with the customer service radio hour.
[00:54:13.959 --> 00:54:23.724]  To be really serious with people, when I occasionally get one of those calls on air, where's my book, where's my video, you really can't expect me while I'm live on air to really be able to help you.
[00:54:23.744 --> 00:54:25.245]  We're a very small operation.
[00:54:25.945 --> 00:54:27.246]  We don't ask for donations.
[00:54:27.286 --> 00:54:28.507]  We don't ask for your support.
[00:54:29.027 --> 00:54:32.009]  You hear everybody that's gotten their books and videos on air that's called in.
[00:54:32.789 --> 00:54:39.173]  In fact, the same individual from Germany said that he's gotten stuff in the past from us.
[00:54:40.353 --> 00:54:43.475]  I am very close to suspending all foreign orders.
[00:54:44.349 --> 00:54:50.531]  Not only does Homeland Security search everything that leaves the country now, and openly just throw away whatever they want.
[00:54:51.091 --> 00:54:52.171]  And this is admitted to.
[00:54:53.592 --> 00:54:57.853]  Not just our political stuff, but products and things, period.
[00:54:59.533 --> 00:55:00.574]  Foreign governments.
[00:55:00.734 --> 00:55:02.974]  Canada is the hardest.
[00:55:03.934 --> 00:55:09.516]  On average, we do it really as a public service, we have to ship something twice to get it to Canada.
[00:55:10.211 --> 00:55:14.513]  We've been sent back to customs forms telling us that this is considered terrorist material.
[00:55:14.573 --> 00:55:16.254]  I mean, I've put them on the website.
[00:55:16.294 --> 00:55:17.534]  I've covered it on air.
[00:55:18.835 --> 00:55:21.936]  I've personally been grabbed by their customs up there and they know exactly who I am.
[00:55:22.316 --> 00:55:23.857]  Canadians think you're in a free country.
[00:55:23.957 --> 00:55:26.658]  No, they read all your mail and they go through it all.
[00:55:27.598 --> 00:55:27.878]  Okay?
[00:55:27.898 --> 00:55:28.639]  You just need to know that.
[00:55:30.219 --> 00:55:34.021]  England is getting worse, though maybe only one package out of ten gets stopped.
[00:55:34.441 --> 00:55:36.822]  Australia suddenly is almost impossible.
[00:55:37.486 --> 00:55:43.969]  And the Aussies are sending us emails telling us, hey, in their orders they say, hey, we can't order Hollywood movies here now.
[00:55:44.329 --> 00:55:45.410]  We can't get anything here now.
[00:55:45.470 --> 00:55:46.350]  They search everything.
[00:55:46.871 --> 00:55:50.432]  You've got to say, you know, that this is a birthday present.
[00:55:50.452 --> 00:55:52.493]  Can you put in the order that it's a birthday present?
[00:55:52.874 --> 00:55:56.155]  Can you say that it's a Klipsch promotional tape?
[00:55:56.836 --> 00:56:00.497]  Or, you know, you can't get slingshots into Australia now.
[00:56:00.998 --> 00:56:02.919]  I mean, there is a clamp down, folks.
[00:56:03.319 --> 00:56:04.860]  We think we're in free countries.
[00:56:04.960 --> 00:56:05.440]  We're not.
[00:56:07.316 --> 00:56:09.518]  It's hard for people from outside the U.S.
[00:56:09.798 --> 00:56:11.119]  to get things into me now.
[00:56:12.140 --> 00:56:13.120]  And we will continue.
[00:56:13.160 --> 00:56:17.804]  What we're going to do is bump it up to... We're looking at DHL, UPS, or FedEx right now.
[00:56:18.204 --> 00:56:19.585]  We may go with several carriers.
[00:56:19.985 --> 00:56:21.206]  And it's going to cost you a lot more.
[00:56:21.226 --> 00:56:23.348]  I'm about to fill out big forms to send it to you.
[00:56:23.988 --> 00:56:26.670]  But this is what it takes to get these materials.
[00:56:27.651 --> 00:56:29.192]  It has nothing to do with terrorism.
[00:56:29.272 --> 00:56:30.753]  It's all about control.
[00:56:31.974 --> 00:56:34.416]  But, I mean, to really be honest with people though,
[00:56:35.117 --> 00:56:36.598]  I get those calls every once in a while.
[00:56:36.638 --> 00:56:40.462]  Hey man, my name's Belly Bob and I ordered my t-shirt three weeks ago.
[00:56:40.502 --> 00:56:40.942]  Where is it?
[00:56:41.182 --> 00:56:44.024]  I'm just like, hey man, I don't know!
[00:56:44.104 --> 00:56:45.165]  What am I supposed to do?
[00:56:45.666 --> 00:56:50.169]  And there's nothing I can do on the radio here talking with you.
[00:56:50.450 --> 00:56:55.334]  But the reason I decided to just go ahead and talk about this is because it is New World Order related.
[00:56:56.955 --> 00:56:59.097]  But Canada is a nightmare.
[00:56:59.777 --> 00:57:03.060]  I mean, Canada is... I can ship stuff into Russia no problem.
[00:57:03.780 --> 00:57:05.982]  I can ship stuff into Japan, no problem.
[00:57:06.422 --> 00:57:07.463]  Those countries are no problem.
[00:57:07.523 --> 00:57:08.724]  I can ship stuff into Serbia.
[00:57:09.665 --> 00:57:15.630]  It is next to impossible now to get something into Canada on the first shipment.
[00:57:16.090 --> 00:57:18.172]  We've changed the name on Canada's shipments.
[00:57:18.192 --> 00:57:19.973]  We don't put Infowars on them anymore.
[00:57:20.514 --> 00:57:22.475]  That seems to get a few more to slip through.
[00:57:22.956 --> 00:57:24.097]  But you got Snoops!
[00:57:25.197 --> 00:57:30.582]  I mean, your government doesn't like films like Road to Tyranny or Martial Law, Order of Death.
[00:57:32.486 --> 00:57:34.967]  That Canadian papers write up and give good reviews to.
[00:57:35.987 --> 00:57:39.228]  Again, I've found Canadians just don't know how bad it is.
[00:57:39.268 --> 00:57:41.829]  So, buyer beware.
[00:57:42.729 --> 00:57:47.590]  In the U.S., we ship to you UPS, or even Postal Service.
[00:57:47.830 --> 00:57:50.271]  It gets to you 99% of the time, first time.
[00:57:50.711 --> 00:57:57.693]  But outside this country, it is an unbelievable, expensive, money-losing proposition for us.
[00:57:59.031 --> 00:58:00.192]  We've had open discussions.
[00:58:00.252 --> 00:58:02.273]  My staff has said, we've done analysis.
[00:58:02.293 --> 00:58:03.534]  I've got an accountant that works here.
[00:58:04.014 --> 00:58:06.056]  You're losing money on these firing shipments.
[00:58:06.076 --> 00:58:07.537]  And I go, just keep it going.
[00:58:08.277 --> 00:58:09.158]  Just keep it going.
[00:58:09.178 --> 00:58:09.938]  Just keep it going.
[00:58:09.978 --> 00:58:10.779]  Just keep shipping it.
[00:58:11.698 --> 00:58:15.901]  And so that's, again, an inside view of what we're doing here and what we're fighting against.
[00:58:15.921 --> 00:58:16.602]  So support us.
[00:58:16.982 --> 00:58:26.309]  Go to InfoWars.com, order TerrorStorm, get Martial Law, get all the great books and videos we carry, and realize what the government's doing to stop you from getting this info.
[00:58:26.590 --> 00:58:28.631]  So make copies of all my videos once you get them.
[00:58:29.011 --> 00:58:30.092]  They cannot stop us.
[00:58:30.132 --> 00:58:31.153]  They will not stop us.
[00:58:31.493 --> 00:58:32.494]  We will prevail.
[00:58:33.495 --> 00:58:33.875]  All right.
[00:58:34.316 --> 00:58:36.037]  We'll be right back with the second hour.
[00:58:40.293 --> 00:58:45.316]  If you would like a copy of this show, come to GCNlive.com and reserve it today, or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[00:58:45.336 --> 00:58:46.617]  More than... Big Brother.
[00:58:46.637 --> 00:58:47.237]  Mainstream media.
[00:58:47.257 --> 00:58:49.298]  Government cover-ups.
[00:58:50.339 --> 00:58:52.820]  You want answers?
[00:59:02.882 --> 00:59:03.762]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:03.782 --> 00:59:08.344]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:08.624 --> 00:59:12.726]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:12.946 --> 00:59:16.227]  Alright, I'm gonna go to your calls early in this hour.
[00:59:16.267 --> 00:59:18.568]  I got sidetracked at the end of the last hour.
[00:59:21.068 --> 00:59:28.111]  So, John and Jason and James and Ben and Nathaniel and others, your calls are coming up.
[00:59:29.953 --> 00:59:31.254]  Big news on 9-11, L.A.
[00:59:32.114 --> 00:59:51.364]  Times huge story about Oliver Stone's film versus what the quote conspiracy theorists are saying and a big village voice story that's pretty darn fair concerning all the 9-11 films that are becoming smash hits on the internet like my new film Terror Storm.
[00:59:53.926 --> 01:00:05.408]  But for the next hour, we are also honored to be joined monthly by Michael Rivero, a great investigative reporter and a website commandant who just does a fabulous job.
[01:00:07.028 --> 01:00:15.110]  And he joins us to talk about, well, how the neocons are lobbying and pushing for World War III in the Middle East.
[01:00:15.170 --> 01:00:17.890]  They promised us another war on October Surprise.
[01:00:17.950 --> 01:00:18.890]  Here it is in Lebanon.
[01:00:19.450 --> 01:00:21.831]  Bush coming out and saying, hey, hold off on a ceasefire.
[01:00:21.851 --> 01:00:22.951]  I mean, how obvious is that?
[01:00:23.826 --> 01:00:25.548]  And a whole host of other issues.
[01:00:25.588 --> 01:00:29.412]  We will go to your calls early in this hour because Rivero can speak on any topic.
[01:00:29.472 --> 01:00:30.453]  Extremely informed.
[01:00:30.913 --> 01:00:32.235]  Michael, always good to have you with us.
[01:00:33.096 --> 01:00:34.777]  Thank you for having me back on the show, Alex.
[01:00:35.017 --> 01:00:35.378]  You bet.
[01:00:36.292 --> 01:00:38.914]  I tell you, C-SPAN really lit a fuse.
[01:00:38.954 --> 01:00:44.019]  We've seen the truth movement for 9-11 growing exponentially, gaining steam.
[01:00:44.659 --> 01:00:50.965]  None of the kooky disinfo stuff got brought up during our panel discussion, which was good on C-SPAN that aired four times.
[01:00:51.465 --> 01:00:57.531]  Now it's gone supernova, and the media is really now, the controlled press, is really having to respond, Michael.
[01:00:58.452 --> 01:01:02.135]  Yeah, they are, and I think what really kind of kicked it off
[01:01:03.097 --> 01:01:05.879]  In addition to C-SPAN airing your wonderful panel.
[01:01:05.959 --> 01:01:06.939]  Was the NORAD tapes?
[01:01:07.559 --> 01:01:09.340]  Yeah, well the NORAD tapes were part of it.
[01:01:09.380 --> 01:01:11.822]  The other was the Scripps poll.
[01:01:12.402 --> 01:01:16.684]  And this was not an online poll, where it was just people on the internet responding.
[01:01:16.704 --> 01:01:20.746]  But they went out and did a regular, you know, pick up the phone and dial people at random poll.
[01:01:21.386 --> 01:01:27.469]  And they came up with fully one-third of Americans do not believe the official government story on 9-11.
[01:01:27.770 --> 01:01:30.571]  And I think that came as a real shock to a lot of people.
[01:01:31.162 --> 01:01:35.423]  In the mainstream media and in the government, this has since been followed up by some additional polls.
[01:01:35.663 --> 01:01:52.468]  CNN ran one online just in the last two days that came back with 74% of respondents saying that they thought the alternative theories to 9-11 were perfectly credible, which essentially is saying that it is at least equally credible with that of the US government.
[01:01:53.215 --> 01:01:55.857]  And they're having to deal with it.
[01:01:56.118 --> 01:01:57.219]  It's not going to go away.
[01:01:57.239 --> 01:02:02.923]  And right now, I think we're probably going to see a lot more of these limited hangouts.
[01:02:02.943 --> 01:02:15.513]  We saw one this morning with this article that came out where the head of the 9-11 Commission is admitting, in quote marks, that they whitewashed the motive for 9-11 as being U.S.
[01:02:15.553 --> 01:02:20.097]  support for Israel, which of course, you know, is kind of a very minor issue.
[01:02:21.494 --> 01:02:35.017]  But they're still trying to push the thing that Arabs did it, Arabs did it, but what most people don't understand is that when the 9-11 Commission was set up, it was specifically directed not to look at the issue of who committed the crime.
[01:02:35.577 --> 01:02:44.999]  It simply declared, these are the people who did it, the Commission's job is to look at the intelligence failures that allowed it to happen, and to show you just how silly this really was.
[01:02:45.019 --> 01:02:49.760]  Well, the Commission said from the start, we're not going to look at guilt, we're looking at ways to make things better.
[01:02:50.709 --> 01:03:02.894]  That was basically it, and this would be just like after the sinking of the Titanic, if the investigation had focused solely on the metallurgy of the boat, and not looked at issues of missing binoculars and E.J.
[01:03:02.954 --> 01:03:13.978]  Smith ignoring the warnings about icebergs ahead, and you would have gotten a very nice report saying we can make the steel better for next time, but it would not have dealt with the issues of how the sinking happened at all.
[01:03:14.508 --> 01:03:16.909]  And we've got the same thing here with the 9-11 Commission.
[01:03:17.189 --> 01:03:24.873]  They're looking at intelligence failures back and forth, but they never went in and looked at what actually happened that day.
[01:03:25.033 --> 01:03:31.876]  And as we look back on that decision from the point of view of a country that really doesn't accept the official story anymore,
[01:03:32.615 --> 01:03:33.476]  It's very obvious.
[01:03:33.636 --> 01:03:35.777]  This was an intended cover-up.
[01:03:36.298 --> 01:03:37.398]  Michael Romero, stay there.
[01:03:37.458 --> 01:03:37.899]  We've got to break.
[01:03:37.959 --> 01:03:45.524]  I want to come back and talk about this constellation or this flotilla of breaking 9-11 stories and what you think is behind that.
[01:03:45.904 --> 01:03:47.405]  When we get back, then we'll take calls.
[01:03:47.425 --> 01:03:48.446]  We'll get into Israel as well.
[01:03:55.342 --> 01:03:58.545]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[01:03:58.885 --> 01:04:00.766]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[01:04:01.187 --> 01:04:08.853]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:04:09.534 --> 01:04:16.579]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:04:16.979 --> 01:04:23.845]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying,
[01:04:24.355 --> 01:04:28.396]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:04:28.696 --> 01:04:32.217]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:04:32.677 --> 01:04:34.598]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:04:34.938 --> 01:04:38.819]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:04:51.932 --> 01:04:57.213]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones introducing you to the incredible Berkey Solar Charger.
[01:04:57.433 --> 01:04:59.493]  Your source for free solar electricity.
[01:04:59.733 --> 01:05:06.855]  This portable system is the size of a book when folded and small enough to fit into a briefcase, handbag, or glove compartment.
[01:05:06.975 --> 01:05:18.497]  The Berkey Solar Charger has been designed to power the Berkey lights, LED lamps, as well as other applications such as mobile phones, radios, digital cameras, and PDAs when electricity is not available.
[01:05:18.897 --> 01:05:26.282]  It's multi-voltage capabilities, multiple adapters, and rechargeable batteries provide for flexible source of auxiliary backup power.
[01:05:26.562 --> 01:05:31.546]  Simply place the Berkey Solar Charger in the sun, plug in your application, and you have power.
[01:05:31.686 --> 01:05:36.689]  Disconnect your application, the system automatically begins charging its own rechargeable batteries.
[01:05:36.989 --> 01:05:42.513]  Get the incredible Berkey Solar Charger for only $75 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:05:42.613 --> 01:05:44.214]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:05:51.821 --> 01:05:55.867]  People who use Cartabite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[01:05:56.087 --> 01:05:59.472]  For over five years, Cartabite has proven itself time-tested.
[01:05:59.652 --> 01:06:03.097]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cartabite.
[01:06:03.382 --> 01:06:06.605]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[01:06:06.625 --> 01:06:12.130]  The basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the diseases that we see.
[01:06:12.170 --> 01:06:21.799]  When we do our program, you know, in herpal formulas like cardivite and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill now going for regular jobs a few months later, we know we're doing something right.
[01:06:21.919 --> 01:06:23.280]  It's a well thought out formula.
[01:06:23.320 --> 01:06:28.705]  I mean, the idea of it working on yeast and metals both at the same time and liver function is dead on.
[01:06:29.085 --> 01:06:33.626]  If you'll find, I think, that it'll work more than just on heart problems and circulation problems.
[01:06:33.646 --> 01:06:35.087]  It'll work on other problems as well.
[01:06:35.247 --> 01:06:39.628]  For more information, call 1-877-928-8822 or visit our website at www.heartdrop.com.
[01:06:39.808 --> 01:06:41.289]  That toll-free number again?
[01:06:41.309 --> 01:06:41.449]  1-877-928-8822.
[01:06:41.469 --> 01:06:43.910]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:06:44.010 --> 01:06:46.450]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:02.702 --> 01:07:04.383]  This happens from time to time.
[01:07:06.103 --> 01:07:09.605]  Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com are down right now.
[01:07:10.705 --> 01:07:19.049]  And when they are down, you can always visit JonesReport.com, PrisonPlanet.tv, and sites like that.
[01:07:19.409 --> 01:07:21.470]  We're trying to diversify the servers they're on.
[01:07:23.091 --> 01:07:27.973]  Sometimes it's denial of service, sometimes it's our fault, sometimes it's just too many visitors.
[01:07:28.710 --> 01:07:30.291]  And it happens every few months.
[01:07:30.311 --> 01:07:31.572]  We'll be down for a few hours.
[01:07:31.932 --> 01:07:37.636]  We're down right now, but be sure to visit them after they're back up, because there's a lot of important news up there today.
[01:07:38.236 --> 01:07:43.959]  Going back to Michael Rivera, a great investigative journalist and the man that runs and founded WhatReallyHappened.com.
[01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:51.144]  Michael, we have seen C-SPAN go ahead and air our panel discussion from L.A.
[01:07:51.264 --> 01:07:54.726]  a month late, but they still did it after we pressured them.
[01:07:56.121 --> 01:08:00.044]  And they aired it four times, so it had time to really build up a big audience by the fourth playing.
[01:08:01.325 --> 01:08:07.469]  Then we have seen the 9-11 Commission come out and say we were deliberately misled and lied to by the Pentagon.
[01:08:08.729 --> 01:08:11.631]  We considered recommending criminal charges.
[01:08:12.892 --> 01:08:16.294]  We have other leaks coming out on 9-11.
[01:08:16.314 --> 01:08:18.696]  It looks like people are trying to point fingers now.
[01:08:19.456 --> 01:08:20.437]  What is the point of that?
[01:08:20.477 --> 01:08:22.659]  Because in a way it's a limited hangout.
[01:08:24.135 --> 01:08:29.679]  And releasing these new NORAD tapes, but really it just discredits their official story even more.
[01:08:30.299 --> 01:08:39.185]  Meanwhile, hundreds of hit pieces against the 9-11 Truth Movement in the last month, but then dozens and dozens that are pretty neutral or fair or positive.
[01:08:40.266 --> 01:08:46.390]  And the media ignored the Zogby poll that found 48% believe the government was involved.
[01:08:46.410 --> 01:08:47.751]  Remember, that came out three months ago.
[01:08:48.011 --> 01:08:51.574]  But they gave this Scripps Howard, Ohio University poll at 36% massive attention.
[01:08:54.395 --> 01:08:56.876]  I mean, what do you think is really going on here, Michael Rivera?
[01:08:57.656 --> 01:09:08.578]  Well, I think what's really going on is that the mainstream media has finally come to grips with the fact that most Americans, or many Americans, a significant portion, are now getting their news off of the Internet.
[01:09:09.459 --> 01:09:19.721]  And I think going back to the Downing Street memo, when this was all over the Internet, but the mainstream media was just pointedly not covering it,
[01:09:20.194 --> 01:09:24.578]  And it became obvious to Americans that the mainstream media was avoiding this story.
[01:09:24.938 --> 01:09:28.761]  That began to really damage their credibility with a lot of people.
[01:09:29.141 --> 01:09:35.967]  So now when something gains a certain critical mass of exposure on the internet, the mainstream media is having to deal with it.
[01:09:36.651 --> 01:09:37.612]  I agree.
[01:09:37.752 --> 01:09:49.200]  I agree to stay in the game, to even have any pertinence and not be relegated to the age of horse and buggies and the age of race cars and rocket ships.
[01:09:49.620 --> 01:09:53.603]  They have got to now start addressing 9-11.
[01:09:54.823 --> 01:09:56.224]  They have to, very much so.
[01:09:56.264 --> 01:09:59.667]  They're trying to stay relevant so that they can basically stay in business.
[01:09:59.947 --> 01:10:04.710]  But as we've been seeing, a lot of newspapers are having to let people go, a lot of TV news departments
[01:10:05.020 --> 01:10:12.742]  are having to scale back their budgets because they're losing their viewership and their readership to shows like yours and to websites like mine.
[01:10:13.382 --> 01:10:28.127]  And so as these doubts about 9-11 continue to circulate and you get the huge audience that you get at your presentation in Los Angeles, they have to deal with it now because it is more damaging to their credibility to try and ignore it than to go along with it.
[01:10:28.567 --> 01:10:33.128]  And as far as the difference in whether an article is fair or a hit piece, I think we've reached the point
[01:10:33.636 --> 01:10:43.791]  Where those who know something funny is going on are starting to think more in terms of their own self-preservation than in going along with the general agenda.
[01:10:44.190 --> 01:10:51.292]  And we're starting to see the factionalization and breakup of everybody who was in on... Exactly, that happens in the establishment.
[01:10:51.352 --> 01:10:54.793]  Finally, the first few people start saying, I don't care, I'm going to go public.
[01:10:55.113 --> 01:10:56.053]  Like Charlie Sheen.
[01:10:56.073 --> 01:10:57.473]  You know, Charlie isn't perfect.
[01:10:57.773 --> 01:10:58.854]  He's got a lot of courage.
[01:10:59.134 --> 01:11:00.314]  He's an intelligent man.
[01:11:00.334 --> 01:11:03.415]  And Charlie Sheen decided
[01:11:04.415 --> 01:11:08.116]  You know, to go public, to try to supercharge things and get a focus on it.
[01:11:08.576 --> 01:11:14.118]  And I think people recognized that it was the courage, that he knew he was going to be attacked.
[01:11:14.138 --> 01:11:16.819]  And I think that was a bellwether event.
[01:11:17.379 --> 01:11:26.801]  And then loose change, second edition, and others got massive attention on the foundations of what you and I and others who were there from day one, Michael Rivero, had done.
[01:11:27.081 --> 01:11:28.822]  Then we hit C-SPAN, then we have
[01:11:29.182 --> 01:11:33.627]  The King Commission kind of turning on NORAD, trying to blame them.
[01:11:34.407 --> 01:11:39.352]  Really, we see this, as I like to say, going supernova, going critical.
[01:11:39.973 --> 01:11:41.174]  I absolutely agree with you.
[01:11:41.514 --> 01:11:47.140]  I think the finger-pointing is definitely the first sign that the cracks are starting to appear in the facade.
[01:11:47.560 --> 01:11:52.686]  What Charlie Sheen did took a lot of courage, because for those of us who've been around for a while, and we think back to the 60s,
[01:11:53.507 --> 01:11:59.852]  And actress Jean Seberg and how her career was utterly destroyed by the FBI for daring to speak out on civil rights.
[01:12:00.212 --> 01:12:12.500]  So what Charlie did took a lot of courage, and those of us who were in the know, and especially those of us who also work in show business, we knew that Charlie was basically throwing his career on the line to speak out as he did.
[01:12:13.161 --> 01:12:23.008]  And one of the reasons I regret not getting to Los Angeles for your little shindig is I wanted to shake his hand and say, I know what you're headed for, and congratulations on your courage.
[01:12:23.757 --> 01:12:26.119]  Well, I mean, it really is amazing courage.
[01:12:26.159 --> 01:12:26.980]  He's not stupid.
[01:12:27.020 --> 01:12:33.045]  He knew what he was doing, and I think people, you know, some people said, well, so what if a Hollywood person goes public?
[01:12:33.285 --> 01:12:34.066]  You know, what do they know?
[01:12:34.546 --> 01:12:37.388]  The point is that he knew what he had to sacrifice.
[01:12:37.809 --> 01:12:47.537]  He knew what would happen to him, and believe me, if you knew the behind-the-scenes stuff, none of that media lynching and pilloring he got was by accident, Michael, was it?
[01:12:48.183 --> 01:12:49.283]  No, absolutely not.
[01:12:49.944 --> 01:12:55.786]  And back in the 90s I went through that ringer myself, so I know exactly how it can work.
[01:12:56.026 --> 01:13:03.668]  And it's kind of interesting because Jackie Mason came out actually in defense of Mel Gibson just a day ago.
[01:13:03.968 --> 01:13:07.369]  And the comments that he made are absolutely bang spot on.
[01:13:07.409 --> 01:13:10.290]  You've got a lot of people in Hollywood who've never made it.
[01:13:10.390 --> 01:13:12.571]  They are very, very jealous of those who have.
[01:13:12.995 --> 01:13:19.820]  And at any excuse they will all leap on to attack somebody to bring them down because it makes them feel better about themselves.
[01:13:20.547 --> 01:13:23.668]  And, you know, Jackie absolutely hit it right on the head.
[01:13:23.988 --> 01:13:34.472]  When looking at the theory that was directed at Mel Gibson, somebody says, ah, he's an anti-Semite, and everybody else says, ah, there's a reason to knock him down, and he doesn't deserve to be successful, and I should be in his place.
[01:13:34.512 --> 01:13:38.193]  And there's a lot of that going on, and Charlie's feeling a lot of that as well.
[01:13:38.453 --> 01:13:44.755]  But the bottom line is, knowing that that mechanism is there, and, you know, it took tremendous, tremendous courage.
[01:13:45.103 --> 01:13:47.624]  For Charlie Sheen to stand up there and say what he said.
[01:13:47.805 --> 01:13:50.166]  Well, you mentioned Mel Gibson and then we'll go to some calls.
[01:13:50.626 --> 01:13:55.169]  I haven't really made a lot of statements on this subject because I've been trying to analyze it and look at it.
[01:13:55.249 --> 01:13:59.091]  Number one, I smell a rat.
[01:13:59.151 --> 01:14:00.752]  He's at this bar near his house.
[01:14:02.333 --> 01:14:04.614]  All these people photographed themselves with him.
[01:14:05.614 --> 01:14:13.599]  He has a blood alcohol level for someone his size of three drinks, three beers, three glasses of wine, but now they say he was drinking beer in an hour.
[01:14:15.223 --> 01:14:20.326]  And then just out of the blue, he starts saying, are you Jewish?
[01:14:20.386 --> 01:14:23.167]  Jews cause all the wars in the world.
[01:14:23.187 --> 01:14:30.190]  And I don't know, again, how did this just spontaneously start?
[01:14:30.750 --> 01:14:34.892]  And then it just so happens that the policeman was Jewish.
[01:14:36.047 --> 01:14:43.771]  This is something most people don't know, but it's in the California newspapers that the person was a Jewish police officer.
[01:14:43.811 --> 01:14:51.414]  Now, I think if Mel Gibson would have said, the Zionists are starting all the wars in the Middle East, I would have said, well, I mean, he's allowed to say that.
[01:14:51.674 --> 01:14:52.555]  That's really true.
[01:14:53.215 --> 01:14:56.118]  I think it's a broad brush to say Jews start all the wars in the world.
[01:14:56.158 --> 01:14:56.879]  There's a lot of Jews.
[01:14:57.319 --> 01:15:00.662]  The majority in Israel have been against the war until the rockets started hitting them.
[01:15:01.483 --> 01:15:12.894]  But, I mean, where is free speech in this country that's what somebody says on the side of the highway when they've been drinking is the equivalent of cutting small children's heads off, Michael Rivero.
[01:15:13.937 --> 01:15:26.112]  Well, I don't agree with what Mel Gibson said, but I do think we have a First Amendment in this country, and he can say what he says, and we can stand up and say we don't agree with you, and that is how debate moves forward.
[01:15:26.472 --> 01:15:33.080]  It does sound like somewhere there may have been a provocation that was not reported for him to launch into that particular tirade.
[01:15:33.724 --> 01:15:35.766]  Well I mean that's my whole point is that
[01:15:51.562 --> 01:16:05.811]  Michael, you know I've not even been as critical as Israel as a lot of other people have, and so I get attacked by the crowd that thinks of a thunderstorm comes by, the Jews caused it, but then I also get attacked by people who say I'm too critical of Israel, and I'm just sick of it.
[01:16:06.131 --> 01:16:15.237]  I mean, frankly, I'm sick of getting threatening phone calls going, you son of a... how dare you say you're not for the war in Israel, you're a Jew hater, and we're gonna get you!
[01:16:15.257 --> 01:16:17.479]  I mean, that's not how you make friends.
[01:16:18.448 --> 01:16:23.933]  No, it isn't, and I think anybody who's being effective at all is getting that kind of phone calls and harassment.
[01:16:23.953 --> 01:16:27.717]  But you know, there's an old saying, if you're catching the flack, it means that you're over the target.
[01:16:28.418 --> 01:16:35.364]  And when you get into a position of having influence over public opinion, you're not going to make everybody happy.
[01:16:35.384 --> 01:16:36.325]  You really can't.
[01:16:36.816 --> 01:16:42.901]  And one of the situations I continually find myself in is that all the Democrats think I'm a Republican, which I actually am by heredity.
[01:16:42.941 --> 01:16:43.702]  I'm a paleocon.
[01:16:44.062 --> 01:16:47.145]  But all the Republicans think I'm actually a Democrat.
[01:16:47.365 --> 01:16:51.749]  And this is a way of reducing to simple party labels.
[01:16:55.329 --> 01:17:00.091]  I mean, the whole left-right thing is just a hundred years old.
[01:17:00.111 --> 01:17:04.533]  I mean, it goes back to the French Revolution and before that, you know, to the sinister side of the left hand.
[01:17:04.993 --> 01:17:07.254]  But it has nothing to do with our real political
[01:17:08.314 --> 01:17:08.735]  I agree.
[01:17:08.755 --> 01:17:15.417]  I'm better described as a paleo-conservative myself, which Bush and the Democrats and all of them have no resemblance to.
[01:17:15.998 --> 01:17:20.259]  The so-called right-wingers call me an ultra-supercommie.
[01:17:20.760 --> 01:17:23.841]  I'm now being called ultra-left-wing extremist in major papers.
[01:17:24.581 --> 01:17:30.768]  Because I'm pro-gun, want to control the borders, anti-abortion, and want low taxes and get rid of the Federal Reserve.
[01:17:30.788 --> 01:17:31.729]  Folks, that is not liberal.
[01:17:32.029 --> 01:17:32.930]  That is not communist.
[01:17:32.990 --> 01:17:33.931]  I don't want a government.
[01:17:34.392 --> 01:17:41.579]  And then I am called by the liberals who are establishment, a right-wing fascist, probably a Nazi.
[01:17:42.840 --> 01:17:44.242]  Well, it means you're being effective.
[01:17:44.282 --> 01:17:47.385]  You're doing a good job when you're getting labels like that.
[01:17:48.541 --> 01:17:58.303]  And, you know, obviously there's a tremendous amount of people out there who are operating not from a position of rationality and facts and logic, but they're caught up in their belief systems.
[01:17:58.863 --> 01:18:05.124]  And beliefs are very weird things, because people operate on them without actually thinking that they're true.
[01:18:05.184 --> 01:18:06.444]  I mean, that's the whole idea.
[01:18:06.564 --> 01:18:09.605]  I believe this, even in the absence of proof.
[01:18:10.125 --> 01:18:14.946]  And so people want to believe that they are right to be pursuing the agenda that they're going along with,
[01:18:15.547 --> 01:18:23.270]  And when they can't actually factually debate somebody over the specific issues, they fall back on their beliefs and they start hurling names.
[01:18:23.451 --> 01:18:28.653]  And I think there was an old piece of lawyer advice, if the facts are against you, argue the law.
[01:18:28.673 --> 01:18:30.274]  If the law is against you, argue the facts.
[01:18:30.334 --> 01:18:33.475]  And if both the facts and law are against you, call the other side names.
[01:18:36.127 --> 01:18:45.154]  We're seeing a lot of that now in the present debate in the American society, where people have run out of facts and logic, and we're just down to the name-calling.
[01:18:45.174 --> 01:18:46.055]  You're right.
[01:18:46.115 --> 01:18:46.875]  We've got a break.
[01:18:46.895 --> 01:18:50.899]  We're going to come back right to your calls, and we'll get into what's happening in the Middle East, World War III.
[01:18:53.681 --> 01:18:56.003]  Do you know the truth about breast cancer?
[01:18:57.024 --> 01:18:59.786]  Do you realize that the race for the cure is over?
[01:19:01.354 --> 01:19:11.021]  The best-kept secret in the world today is that now it is possible to kill cancer without personal suffering, mutilation, and poisoning of your entire system.
[01:19:11.942 --> 01:19:17.106]  Now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaysMedInc's patented methodology.
[01:19:17.890 --> 01:19:28.713]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation, we can destroy skin cancer and breast tumors of any size without adverse side effects at a physician's office.
[01:19:29.353 --> 01:19:31.853]  Star War technology at its best.
[01:19:32.754 --> 01:19:36.995]  For more information, call 702-953-0267 or visit www.laysmedinc.com or call 702-953-0267.
[01:19:57.307 --> 01:19:58.527]  Currency devaluation.
[01:19:58.847 --> 01:19:59.427]  Inflation.
[01:19:59.868 --> 01:20:00.568]  One and the same.
[01:20:01.308 --> 01:20:05.289]  If you had deposited $100,000 at a bank at 1% in a 30-month period dating from May 24, 2005, here is what happened to your funds.
[01:20:11.556 --> 01:20:14.677]  The dollar lost 33% of its value in that time frame.
[01:20:14.937 --> 01:20:16.757]  The bank paid you 1%.
[01:20:16.877 --> 01:20:19.838]  Your $100,000 now has a net purchasing power of $68,000.
[01:20:19.878 --> 01:20:22.619]  Here is reality.
[01:20:22.999 --> 01:20:26.580]  The devaluation of currency equals real inflation.
[01:20:27.060 --> 01:20:30.721]  Keep in mind how the value of your paper assets are measured in dollars.
[01:20:31.281 --> 01:20:35.022]  Gold in the same time frame increased 35% in value.
[01:20:35.462 --> 01:20:39.143]  Learn how to protect and profit in this truly unstable world economy.

[01:20:51.610 --> 01:20:52.371]  Terrorism!
[01:20:52.531 --> 01:20:53.271]  Terrorism!
[01:20:53.391 --> 01:20:59.436]  Chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallout, biological attack, anthrax, and to top it all off, dump tape and plastic!
[01:20:59.716 --> 01:21:01.317]  Alarming words for our time!
[01:21:01.537 --> 01:21:04.019]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[01:21:04.419 --> 01:21:18.989]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.

[01:21:21.671 --> 01:21:27.593]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[01:21:27.733 --> 01:21:32.234]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video, Sheltering in Place.

[01:21:52.113 --> 01:21:54.616]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[01:21:55.156 --> 01:22:03.244]  Did you know the syndicated columnist Charlie Reese once wrote a stinging indictment against the internationalists who have captured our federal government for their own purposes?
[01:22:04.044 --> 01:22:09.009]  He reported that the present government of the United States is systematically undoing our independence.
[01:22:09.759 --> 01:22:17.205]  He said that agreeing to belong to the World Trade Organization and taking orders from it was a deliberate sacrifice of our national sovereignty.
[01:22:18.026 --> 01:22:21.749]  He said the United Nations represents the same threat to our sovereignty.
[01:22:22.630 --> 01:22:25.872]  We'd like to help you understand how these things are coming to pass.

[01:22:33.815 --> 01:22:34.235]  Call now.
[01:22:34.275 --> 01:22:37.216]  Operators are standing by to receive your call.
[01:22:57.122 --> 01:22:59.783]  Alright, Michael Rivero riding shotgun with us.
[01:22:59.823 --> 01:23:01.123]  Let's go straight to the calls.
[01:23:01.663 --> 01:23:03.844]  John in New York, thank you for holding patiently.
[01:23:03.864 --> 01:23:04.524]  You're on the air.
[01:23:04.544 --> 01:23:06.224]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[01:23:06.264 --> 01:23:06.584]  Good, sir.
[01:23:06.604 --> 01:23:09.785]  John from the Lone Lantern Society here in Albany, New York.
[01:23:11.766 --> 01:23:12.246]  Okay, sir.
[01:23:12.266 --> 01:23:12.586]  Go ahead.
[01:23:12.626 --> 01:23:12.946]  Welcome.
[01:23:13.604 --> 01:23:24.448]  Yes, I'm with the Lone Lantern Society, I'll be in New York, just calling to say we're working hard for the 9-11 Truth Movement with Jason and Corey Fremontiata there from Loose Change.
[01:23:25.228 --> 01:23:31.771]  They're going to be previewing a screening this fall, trying to arrange that on campus at SUNY Albany.
[01:23:32.683 --> 01:23:34.944]  Good, yeah, there's lots of political action everywhere.
[01:23:35.044 --> 01:23:37.245]  Do you have a question or a comment or anything?
[01:23:37.586 --> 01:23:48.511]  Yeah, we just wanted to know, I wanted to know more about the, if you've seen anything with the biometric scanning, eye scanning, because they're currently doing pilot programs here in Albany Airport for that.
[01:23:48.891 --> 01:23:52.092]  I want to know if you've seen anything out in Texas or Midwest.
[01:23:52.132 --> 01:23:54.854]  Yes, these biometric grids are going in everywhere.
[01:23:54.894 --> 01:23:57.095]  It's standardized through the
[01:23:59.314 --> 01:24:12.662]  The Real ID Act, they passed last year, and they're running public service announcements everywhere about how soon you'll be thumb scanning to buy and sell, and retina scanning, and how great it is, and it's about the NSA tracking everything you do.
[01:24:13.142 --> 01:24:16.144]  All of it is a total violation of the Fourth Amendment.
[01:24:16.204 --> 01:24:16.964]  Michael Rivera?
[01:24:17.965 --> 01:24:27.830]  Well, my concern about the biometrics is there seem to be a high incidence of false positives, and I know when they tried some experimental face scanning technologies in airports,
[01:24:28.566 --> 01:24:32.127]  They were stopping lots of people as possible suspects for terrorism.
[01:24:32.427 --> 01:24:38.469]  They didn't find one actual terrorism, but like thousands of people got... Yeah, well, the same thing happened in Tampa.
[01:24:38.509 --> 01:24:43.391]  Remember, it was all these SWAT teams being sent out to construction workers eating a hot dog.
[01:24:43.411 --> 01:24:45.451]  But remember what came out two weeks ago, Michael.
[01:24:45.491 --> 01:24:46.091]  They want that.
[01:24:46.111 --> 01:24:48.112]  They want the illusion of terrorism.
[01:24:48.432 --> 01:24:54.794]  The air marshals are ordered to put innocent people every month into a database as terrorists
[01:24:55.574 --> 01:25:07.057]  For standing up too long by the bathroom, taking photos with their camera, whole families and the marshals are complaining saying they're being told to do this to create the illusion that suspicious activity is going on.
[01:25:07.797 --> 01:25:19.821]  And the point is that this kind of data insertion, if you will, I mean the whole database is going to be useless because it's just junked up with all of these false positives to make it look like they've got huge numbers of potential suspects.
[01:25:20.341 --> 01:25:24.302]  So as a tool for actually fighting terrorism, it is actually going to be useless.
[01:25:25.811 --> 01:25:27.593]  Anything else there, John?
[01:25:28.073 --> 01:25:31.998]  What are you going to do in May 2008 when we have to take this federal ID?
[01:25:32.918 --> 01:25:35.659]  That they're going to be putting out through the Real ID Act.
[01:25:35.739 --> 01:25:36.499]  Through the states.
[01:25:36.519 --> 01:25:44.341]  We're going to have to protest it and say no and point out that it's a national ID card and have lawsuits and get this thing repealed.
[01:25:44.401 --> 01:25:46.222]  So that's a whole other fight we've got in front of us.
[01:25:46.622 --> 01:25:47.462]  Thank you for the call.
[01:25:47.502 --> 01:25:51.283]  But again, it's going to be easier as more people wake up and that is now happening.
[01:25:51.623 --> 01:25:53.104]  Let's talk to Jason in Maryland.
[01:25:53.124 --> 01:25:54.504]  Jason, thank you for joining us.
[01:25:55.064 --> 01:25:55.345]  Hello.
[01:25:55.505 --> 01:26:00.266]  I was wondering if either of you know anything about the protests that were going on
[01:26:00.888 --> 01:26:07.510]  Temple Mount, and do you think that Israel will be going into Damascus?
[01:26:08.231 --> 01:26:10.531]  Yeah, we're kicking off the Israel discussion.
[01:26:11.492 --> 01:26:16.934]  Michael Rivero, in a nutshell, what is this whole escalation against the Lebanese about?
[01:26:16.994 --> 01:26:19.635]  What's really behind it, and how far will Israel go?
[01:26:20.795 --> 01:26:28.998]  Well, it is very obvious that Israel has been planning an incursion into Lebanon ever since last year when Hariri was assassinated.
[01:26:29.446 --> 01:26:34.831]  And Syria, which had been militarily protecting Lebanon from Israel, was forced to leave.
[01:26:35.332 --> 01:26:41.577]  Now, of course, everyone's focusing on four weeks ago when two Israeli soldiers were captured by Hezbollah.
[01:26:42.018 --> 01:26:54.169]  There continues to be an intense debate over exactly where they were captured, with most of the early reports saying that they had actually infiltrated inside Lebanon to a village of Ait al-Shab.
[01:26:55.087 --> 01:26:57.549]  And that that was where the capture actually took place.
[01:26:57.709 --> 01:27:01.631]  Israel, of course, is trying to insist that they were captured inside Israel.
[01:27:02.072 --> 01:27:11.698]  But the real point is that there have been a lot of incursions by Israel into Lebanon as an ongoing operation for months, if not years.
[01:27:12.438 --> 01:27:18.302]  And it appears that this was simply set up to be the excuse to go in with an invasion that was already planned.
[01:27:19.558 --> 01:27:20.318]  Uh... all along.
[01:27:20.418 --> 01:27:25.141]  Well, Michael, you were here a month ago with us and you said, look for him to start a war in the Middle East.
[01:27:25.201 --> 01:27:26.222]  Something's going to happen.
[01:27:26.522 --> 01:27:28.304]  Bush had given Iran an ultimatum.
[01:27:28.704 --> 01:27:32.286]  They need some type of military distraction for the elections here domestically.
[01:27:32.707 --> 01:27:36.889]  Olmert's in trouble with sexual harassment and bribe-taking reports.
[01:27:37.390 --> 01:27:39.391]  And so this is just more of the same here.
[01:27:39.491 --> 01:27:41.793]  Could this escalate into World War III?
[01:27:42.859 --> 01:27:51.645]  I think there's definitely a potential when you get into a situation like this, future events are really under the control of whichever one of the leaders is the least mentally stable.
[01:27:52.285 --> 01:28:00.611]  And along with pushing up to the Latani River to acquire the water, Israel is opening up a wide front, a direct border between Israel and Syria.
[01:28:00.971 --> 01:28:04.814]  They're already attacking Syrian farm workers right along that border.
[01:28:05.599 --> 01:28:15.876]  And the Syrian government has come out and said that if Israel attacks Syrian territory, that they will immediately come back in and join with Hezbollah on the war.
[01:28:16.477 --> 01:28:20.423]  And this is an ideal situation for anybody who wants to escalate the war.
[01:28:21.119 --> 01:28:28.341]  And what we have is the government of Israel and the government of the United States wanting the wars to escalate, but for somebody else to look like they're to blame for it.
[01:28:28.741 --> 01:28:30.881]  We'll be back with Michael Rivero and more calls.
[01:28:30.921 --> 01:28:33.442]  Thank you, Jason, James, Ben, Nathaniel, and others.
[01:28:33.462 --> 01:28:36.743]  You're up next.
[01:28:36.763 --> 01:28:37.083]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:28:37.443 --> 01:28:39.384]  We'll get right into Israel on the other side.
[01:28:42.424 --> 01:28:43.325]  We're on the march.
[01:28:43.805 --> 01:28:45.425]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:46.325 --> 01:28:49.026]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:54.082 --> 01:28:58.244]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass?
[01:28:58.464 --> 01:29:00.244]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[01:29:00.504 --> 01:29:06.847]  If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough, the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[01:29:07.147 --> 01:29:13.329]  Using a similar principle, Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[01:29:13.569 --> 01:29:21.052]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions with no side effects.
[01:29:21.432 --> 01:29:24.274]  Now available is the 2006 Biosolutions Plus.
[01:29:24.474 --> 01:29:28.536]  The Biosolutions Plus is the easiest to operate frequency instrument ever developed.
[01:29:28.696 --> 01:29:32.258]  Its easy reference guide will allow you to begin using the instrument within minutes.
[01:29:32.558 --> 01:29:36.301]  Simple step-by-step instructions using pictures are easy to follow.

[01:29:51.616 --> 01:29:56.861]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[01:29:57.002 --> 01:30:05.090]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[01:30:05.350 --> 01:30:12.397]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[01:30:13.337 --> 01:30:19.821]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[01:30:20.021 --> 01:30:25.104]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[01:30:25.224 --> 01:30:34.090]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick and pets.
[01:30:34.370 --> 01:30:37.652]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5.

[01:31:58.487 --> 01:32:06.113]  Coming up in the next hour, I'm going to play a clip of George Galloway on National British Television talking about the
[01:32:07.404 --> 01:32:09.626]  Yeah, I mean what he said was mean, it was distasteful.
[01:32:32.473 --> 01:32:38.099]  My point is, what he said made no sense in the context of what we're hearing.
[01:32:38.119 --> 01:32:48.529]  And then we hear that, oh, the police weren't going to release it, but within hours of his arrest, they had copies of the supposed lock and key list being given to people.
[01:32:48.929 --> 01:32:49.910]  I think it's a setup.
[01:32:51.091 --> 01:32:54.355]  Well, it does seem like it was certainly exploited and
[01:32:56.533 --> 01:32:59.915]  Uh, Mel's religious views are, of course, no secret.
[01:33:00.315 --> 01:33:05.517]  Uh, even going back to the Passion of the Christ, uh, there had been media issues made about that.
[01:33:05.997 --> 01:33:11.259]  It does feel like, some along the line, there was a provocation, uh, that launched that parade.
[01:33:12.001 --> 01:33:14.342]  And it does feel like it may have been a setup.
[01:33:14.662 --> 01:33:22.385]  But the bottom line... Well, listen, I have a Jewish friend who actually works with me in making documentaries, and he'd been out of town.
[01:33:22.425 --> 01:33:24.506]  He walked in and said, it's a setup.
[01:33:24.606 --> 01:33:26.687]  Somebody started that discussion.
[01:33:26.927 --> 01:33:29.168]  You know, he just didn't out of the blue start saying that.
[01:33:29.728 --> 01:33:37.291]  Yeah, it just doesn't feel like that's something that anybody would just spontaneously start shouting, especially... I mean, he's been pulled over for a DUI.
[01:33:37.391 --> 01:33:41.173]  Why are we going to get into the issue of who is starting the world's wars?
[01:33:42.012 --> 01:33:48.393]  What is going to be uppermost on anybody's mind in that situation is trying to act like they're sober and trying to avoid a breathalyzer test.
[01:33:49.313 --> 01:34:00.936]  And, uh, you know, so it just doesn't make sense how we get from that point to a screaming tirade against a Jewish police officer about how the world's Jews are causing XYZ.
[01:34:01.336 --> 01:34:04.236]  Somewhere in there, there's a missing link that we have not been told about.
[01:34:04.937 --> 01:34:05.737]  Oh, guaranteed.
[01:34:05.857 --> 01:34:06.477]  Guaranteed.
[01:34:07.422 --> 01:34:24.928]  I mean, you can see this coming from a mile away, and I just wish Mel wouldn't have let himself be set up like this, because I know that Mel Gibson and his family are not anti-Semitic, and I don't support anti-Semitism, because Jews are a very diverse group of people with many different views.
[01:34:25.788 --> 01:34:34.771]  Now, it's just like Colin Powell has said, and General Zini, that when you criticize Israel in any way, you're labeled an anti-Semite, and I think
[01:34:35.211 --> 01:34:53.520]  The ADL and others have lost a lot of credibility, Michael Rivero, and they've lost lawsuits too, by demonizing and attacking people that haven't done that, and they've tried to overplay that hand, demonizing a lot of good people, while at the same time, losing any credibility they had to really speak out against bad people!
[01:34:54.688 --> 01:35:10.672]  Well, the damage is even worse than that, because when you have Israel and organizations like the ADL attempting to deliberately blur the line between the actions of the Israeli government and the world's Jewish people... We're trying to make Jews the target!
[01:35:11.032 --> 01:35:11.792]  That's exactly it.
[01:35:11.852 --> 01:35:18.054]  They're setting up the world's Jewish people as the targets for backlashes for what Israel is doing in the Middle East.
[01:35:18.419 --> 01:35:25.822]  And all this does is continue to fuel that whole, we're victims, therefore we're justified in doing what we continue to do, kind of mindset.
[01:35:26.162 --> 01:35:28.503]  And somewhere, someone's got to break that cycle.
[01:35:30.243 --> 01:35:31.404]  Well, you're absolutely right.
[01:35:31.444 --> 01:35:35.465]  I mean, Israel has lied about saying they didn't target UN facilities.
[01:35:35.485 --> 01:35:36.466]  They've always done that.
[01:35:37.126 --> 01:35:45.829]  For six hours, they were begging them to stop pounding them with precision munitions, and then when they finally gave them the exact coordinates, they just shot a missile through the window.
[01:35:47.057 --> 01:35:58.245]  They claim they don't target emergency workers and ambulances, but time and time again, they shoot them right through the Red Cross on the top with laser-guided bombs, where you laze the target, follow it, and that bomb guides itself in perfectly.
[01:35:59.126 --> 01:36:04.970]  They've been doing so much here, they've been caught in so many lies.
[01:36:06.671 --> 01:36:09.934]  Why do you think Israel decided now to go in?
[01:36:10.054 --> 01:36:14.077]  Is it the neocons in Washington needing the diversion, or is it Olmert?
[01:36:14.397 --> 01:36:15.838]  I mean, who's calling the shots here?
[01:36:16.983 --> 01:36:40.600]  Well, my honest opinion about the current situation is that this invasion for Lebanon was actually planned for further into the fall, but that the two soldiers who were captured inside Lebanon were in possession of the war plans, and Israel may have jumped the gun before the political groundwork was fully laid to justify and support this invasion.
[01:36:41.080 --> 01:36:43.882]  And I think that it just feels like
[01:36:44.341 --> 01:36:46.862]  There was a war plan, but it was triggered too soon.
[01:36:46.882 --> 01:36:54.946]  Well, the San Francisco Chronicle, as you know, reported three weeks ago that they had a war plan, and people say, oh, well, they always do war games.
[01:36:55.006 --> 01:37:00.609]  No, they were giving PowerPoint presentations saying, we're planning to reoccupy southern Lebanon.
[01:37:01.309 --> 01:37:05.551]  Yeah, that was definitely known, and I think they were going to do it further into the fall.
[01:37:06.007 --> 01:37:12.748]  But Israel was afraid that the plans were leaking out and didn't want to make it look like they had just gone in there.
[01:37:13.268 --> 01:37:17.669]  So they decided to strike early so that Lebanon is caught reacting and not the other way around.
[01:37:18.470 --> 01:37:25.771]  Well, I did learn that the San Francisco Chronicle was planning to report the Lebanon invasion story right before Israel did go in.
[01:37:25.831 --> 01:37:27.531]  So that's evidence to your theory right there.
[01:37:28.512 --> 01:37:30.072]  Yeah, that would be.
[01:37:30.152 --> 01:37:35.833]  And certainly Bush and Blair, from their reactions, they knew something was up before it actually happened.
[01:37:36.334 --> 01:37:49.841]  But, again, there continues to be this tremendous debate over where these two soldiers were actually captured, and it does appear that, again, going on the initial reports, that they were inside Lebanon at the time.
[01:37:50.421 --> 01:37:52.242]  James in New Jersey, thanks for holding.
[01:37:52.262 --> 01:37:52.923]  You're a trooper.
[01:37:52.943 --> 01:37:53.683]  You're on the air.
[01:37:54.343 --> 01:37:56.704]  Well, hello, my friend.
[01:37:57.905 --> 01:38:05.489]  Alex, I'm a subscriber to PrisonPlanet.tv, and Mr. Rivero, several years ago I purchased a copy of Isle of Sanctuary.
[01:38:06.723 --> 01:38:08.904]  to support your work.
[01:38:10.384 --> 01:38:24.449]  The reason for my call, well first of all, I'm a nurse and I work with a lot of veterans and veterans families and I woke up to government conspiracies through talking to survivors of the Pearl Harbor attack.
[01:38:25.309 --> 01:38:32.611]  I was surprised to hear so many veterans and their families are aware of what really happened with Pearl Harbor.
[01:38:33.251 --> 01:38:33.892]  So when 9-11 happened
[01:38:35.467 --> 01:38:37.967]  It sort of fit in that pattern.
[01:38:37.987 --> 01:38:39.208]  I was ready to accept it.
[01:38:39.988 --> 01:38:52.890]  Now, the reason I called is because before your C-SPAN appearance, there's a radio show, shortwave and internet, that slams you on a regular basis.
[01:38:54.170 --> 01:39:00.211]  And I said to myself, well, let me call up and promote the C-SPAN show.
[01:39:01.472 --> 01:39:04.092]  And when I mentioned your name,
[01:39:05.205 --> 01:39:05.885]  They went off.
[01:39:07.365 --> 01:39:18.727]  And they accused you, Alex, of having a number of outlandish theories about 9-11, none of which I've ever heard you espouse, but they said they had heard you say them.
[01:39:19.307 --> 01:39:28.669]  Things like you did not believe planes actually hit the buildings, things like you said that the Mossad was behind it, this kind of stuff.
[01:39:29.529 --> 01:39:31.049]  What's the name of the show?
[01:39:31.069 --> 01:39:33.670]  Do you really want to give them publicity?
[01:39:33.690 --> 01:39:34.210]  No, I don't care.
[01:39:34.230 --> 01:39:34.670]  It doesn't matter.
[01:39:35.393 --> 01:39:36.614]  The right perspective.
[01:39:36.634 --> 01:39:40.037]  Internet and shortwave.
[01:39:40.418 --> 01:39:42.880]  You know what?
[01:39:43.781 --> 01:39:44.882]  Those are false statements.
[01:39:45.422 --> 01:39:47.284]  Everything I've said about 9-11 is on the record.
[01:39:48.385 --> 01:39:52.749]  I've said the no-plane theory is a fraud.
[01:39:52.769 --> 01:39:56.653]  That's ridiculous.
[01:39:56.673 --> 01:39:59.035]  That type of stuff is being put out to discredit us.
[01:39:59.859 --> 01:40:05.408]  I have been roundly criticized for not saying that the Mossad was involved in 9-11.
[01:40:06.350 --> 01:40:13.782]  Certainly our government was running the operation, criminal elements of it, and I believe the Mossad was aware it may have been in a support role.
[01:40:14.643 --> 01:40:16.584]  Uh, but I mean, all those statements are false.
[01:40:16.605 --> 01:40:16.885]  You know what?
[01:40:17.305 --> 01:40:18.306]  I really wouldn't worry about it.
[01:40:18.326 --> 01:40:20.067]  I mean, let me just tell you something.
[01:40:20.367 --> 01:40:22.669]  People build straw men all the time.
[01:40:22.969 --> 01:40:34.797]  For those that don't know what that is, you can't attack what someone really does or says, so you attribute falsehoods to them, and then, you know, false ideas to them, and then dissect those.
[01:40:35.117 --> 01:40:36.638]  So I appreciate you defending me.
[01:40:36.898 --> 01:40:42.962]  Just keep calling into those shows, and just keep telling them the truth, and just keep plugging InfoWars.com.
[01:40:46.164 --> 01:40:49.184]  Well, I did, and I will continue to do so.
[01:40:50.125 --> 01:40:52.925]  And I was quite amazed to learn that you were a liberal.
[01:40:53.226 --> 01:40:54.466]  I found that out that day.
[01:40:55.646 --> 01:40:57.127]  And I was one too, apparently.
[01:40:58.087 --> 01:41:00.067]  And I don't want to take up any more of your time.
[01:41:00.268 --> 01:41:02.028]  Well, I appreciate your call.
[01:41:02.468 --> 01:41:04.149]  Great work, and keep it up.
[01:41:04.229 --> 01:41:04.749]  Well, thank you.
[01:41:04.769 --> 01:41:06.389]  I mean, let me just comment on this.
[01:41:06.409 --> 01:41:08.890]  This is what me and Michael were talking about 15 minutes ago.
[01:41:10.151 --> 01:41:34.897]  Because I'm against open borders, because I'm pro-Second Amendment, because I'm against Bush spending more money than all presidents before him combined, because I'm against him signing on to UN treaties, getting rid of our sovereignty, and signing the American Union package, now mainstream news, and because I'm for low taxes and low regulation, and I'm against invading a bunch of innocent countries that our founding fathers were against, I am a dirty commie!
[01:41:35.397 --> 01:41:41.262]  Okay, but if you're for all of this and a bunch of Trotskyites running the White House, you're a conservative.
[01:41:41.302 --> 01:41:42.043]  Michael Rivera?
[01:41:43.163 --> 01:41:43.764]  Absolutely.
[01:41:44.745 --> 01:41:57.415]  It is amazing how the labels have actually become reversed because, and I think that's why they delineated it with the phrase neocon, because they realized that the new conservative, so-called conservative platform is actually quite liberal.
[01:41:58.456 --> 01:42:02.539]  What is meant by conservatism is a small conservative limited government
[01:42:03.367 --> 01:42:13.054]  fiscal control and what we have people who are calling themselves the new conservatives, neocons, they're pushing for a larger, more intrusive government even more than the liberals used to.
[01:42:13.515 --> 01:42:20.340]  So the labels have sort of kind of gotten blurred, but yet the labels are still hurled at each other as weapons.
[01:42:21.160 --> 01:42:24.863]  And they also use all the old liberal tricks of calling everyone racist.
[01:42:25.683 --> 01:42:26.644]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:42:26.664 --> 01:42:28.766]  If you don't agree with us, you're a racist.
[01:42:28.826 --> 01:42:32.008]  And certainly Israel supporters are continuing to use that one at every
[01:42:32.586 --> 01:42:59.598]  Uh... point if you know uh... if you don't agree with what's being done then you support terrorists uh... and and you and you're a racist and and so forth and so on and it's reached a point of screed that i think people are beginning to turn off from it they're beginning to see it as simply being a lot of uh... attempting to oh yeah i mean listen i want them all to keep it up that's why they that's why they have diminishing audiences that's why people aren't paying attention to them because it isn't jiving with reality
[01:43:00.422 --> 01:43:01.223]  No, it isn't.
[01:43:01.823 --> 01:43:10.150]  And again, we're seeing the viewership, readership of those particular institutions seriously in decline, while readership of my website is skyrocketing.
[01:43:10.210 --> 01:43:12.192]  I assume that your audience is enlarging every day?
[01:43:12.212 --> 01:43:13.553]  Well, it's left orbit, yeah.
[01:43:14.213 --> 01:43:15.454]  Yeah, okay, well good.
[01:43:16.395 --> 01:43:24.462]  And I think we're going to continue to see that, because ultimately people want to go where the truth can be found, and we're seeing that start to happen here.
[01:43:25.461 --> 01:43:27.482]  Well, I just... I mean, I don't understand it.
[01:43:27.562 --> 01:43:29.344]  I mean, my job is easy, Michael.
[01:43:29.384 --> 01:43:29.864]  It's like yours.
[01:43:29.904 --> 01:43:33.987]  Study history, research the facts, look at who has motives, go research, find the evidence.
[01:43:34.847 --> 01:43:36.828]  I mean, I didn't come to this with an axe to grind.
[01:43:36.868 --> 01:43:38.089]  I just wanted to find out the truth.
[01:43:38.730 --> 01:43:53.219]  And the truth is, we've got a global elite dismantling our sovereignty, setting up a police state, butchering our Bill of Rights, what makes America, America, invading and blowing up innocent countries, lying, falsifying documents, killing innocent people,
[01:43:54.199 --> 01:44:06.716]  And then you've got a bunch of morons running around saying they're conservative and that they've got the holy grail, the ex cathedra, and you've got to follow everything they say, or you're basically Osama Bin Laden's son!
[01:44:07.777 --> 01:44:12.423]  Well, that's, I think, the difference between politics as a moral choice and politics as a fashion statement.
[01:44:12.805 --> 01:44:18.069]  And unfortunately, too many Americans wear their politics as a fashion statement, and that's kind of one of the reasons we're in trouble right now.
[01:44:18.189 --> 01:44:18.389]  It is!
[01:44:18.429 --> 01:44:26.615]  They pick it like, I'm for Pepsi, I'm for Coke, I'm for NASCAR car, number this, or NASCAR number that, or I'm for the Cowboys versus the Titans.
[01:44:27.015 --> 01:44:29.216]  And folks, this is a lot more complex than that!
[01:44:29.237 --> 01:44:30.918]  I mean, this is your life!
[01:44:32.038 --> 01:44:41.285]  Yeah, there's a lot more at stake here, especially when you have so many people on both sides of the political line are continuing to push for wars.
[01:44:41.676 --> 01:44:51.182]  That you will pay for, that your children are going to die in, and it's very easy to start a war when somebody else has to pay for it and somebody else has to bleed for it.
[01:44:51.562 --> 01:44:53.463]  And that's the situation we're in right now.
[01:44:53.543 --> 01:44:58.667]  And if you don't stand up to these people and say no more, they're just going to keep on going.
[01:44:58.687 --> 01:44:59.647]  They don't have a reason to stop.
[01:44:59.747 --> 01:45:05.551]  Well, Michael Rivero, you cut your teeth exposing Bill Clinton for being involved in the murder of Vince Foster.
[01:45:06.098 --> 01:45:14.666]  I mean you got run out of Hollywood basically with the big, now you're doing better than ever, but is that a proper statement to make?
[01:45:15.457 --> 01:45:19.440]  They used a 2x4 with rusty nails through one end of it to get me out of the city limits.
[01:45:19.460 --> 01:45:25.203]  You had a very, and still do, a very successful business in Hollywood, and now you're out of the Hawaiian Islands.
[01:45:25.904 --> 01:45:27.104]  But you've experienced this.
[01:45:27.384 --> 01:45:37.911]  You lost a lot of the stamp to Bill Clinton, and now you get called a dirty commie, because a dirty commie rat, as George C. Scott would say and Dr. Strangelove, meanwhile, Bush
[01:45:38.451 --> 01:45:50.094]  And inactual actions makes Bill Clinton, and I mean this when I say it, look conservative, minus a little bit of rhetoric in some of his statements, and then we're called liberals.
[01:45:50.134 --> 01:46:03.557]  I mean, I don't understand these cult-like, Kool-Aid drinking followers of Bush, when Bush is dismantling this country in front of their eyes, signing on to the American Union, and they don't care.
[01:46:03.577 --> 01:46:05.537]  They email me saying, no, Bush is a conservative.
[01:46:06.613 --> 01:46:10.354]  Well, a lot of it, unfortunately, is starting to function like personality cults.
[01:46:10.554 --> 01:46:17.795]  And you're correct to use the Kool-Aid analogy, because when you get into personality cults, the followers just follow.
[01:46:17.835 --> 01:46:23.356]  They don't think, they don't choose, they just say, I'm with this person, you know, for good or bad.
[01:46:24.196 --> 01:46:24.516]  Pardon me.
[01:46:24.916 --> 01:46:32.718]  And one of the things that I wrote back when the torture scandal first broke, I said, this is a point of no return for a lot of people.
[01:46:33.140 --> 01:46:38.544]  Because dictators don't spring up overnight and say, I'm the dictator, you will follow me, and the people say, yes, we will do that.
[01:46:39.044 --> 01:46:39.785]  That doesn't happen.
[01:46:39.945 --> 01:46:40.926]  It doesn't happen overnight.
[01:46:41.206 --> 01:46:43.348]  Dictators look very good at the beginning.
[01:46:43.368 --> 01:46:44.268]  It's a process.
[01:46:44.849 --> 01:46:45.229]  That's right.
[01:46:45.249 --> 01:46:53.315]  They lure you across the lines on more and more moral choices, things that you might not want to do, but it's necessary now.
[01:46:53.695 --> 01:46:57.298]  And I predicted at that time that everybody who goes along with the torture
[01:46:57.970 --> 01:46:59.694]  Who says, yes, it's necessary.
[01:46:59.894 --> 01:47:02.099]  Once they're over that line, they can't go back.
[01:47:02.379 --> 01:47:08.031]  They can never question Bush, they can never look at what he's done, because then they have to look at what they themselves have become.
[01:47:08.590 --> 01:47:09.611]  And they can't do that.
[01:47:09.651 --> 01:47:10.732]  Well, it's like abortion.
[01:47:10.872 --> 01:47:14.475]  Once you've been involved in it, you want to make excuses for it and say it's okay.
[01:47:15.016 --> 01:47:17.298]  And so now they've been involved in this torture.
[01:47:17.578 --> 01:47:19.900]  They are now accomplices after the fact.
[01:47:20.120 --> 01:47:24.083]  They're accomplices to going in and killing all those Iraqis and all those Lebanese.
[01:47:24.384 --> 01:47:25.285]  So you're absolutely right.
[01:47:25.305 --> 01:47:31.470]  They're going to rationalize this like holding onto a hundred pound bowling ball as it takes them down to the mid-Atlantic.
[01:47:32.378 --> 01:47:33.318]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:47:33.379 --> 01:47:35.600]  They can't go back.
[01:47:35.660 --> 01:47:39.241]  They can never question the ruler, because that means questioning themselves.
[01:47:39.281 --> 01:47:42.863]  The ruler must be right, because if the ruler is wrong, then I am wrong.
[01:47:43.263 --> 01:47:45.344]  And they get caught up in their own ego with this.
[01:47:45.424 --> 01:47:48.626]  And this is where the fanatical supporters of tyrants always come from.
[01:47:48.986 --> 01:47:55.449]  And they don't realize they have literally become enslaved by their own ego, by their own belief systems.
[01:47:56.016 --> 01:48:00.319]  And their own willing blindness, they cannot see what is really going on.
[01:48:00.359 --> 01:48:02.180]  They won't see it because they're part of it.
[01:48:02.440 --> 01:48:03.200]  Well said.
[01:48:03.380 --> 01:48:05.141]  Let's talk to Ben in Florida.
[01:48:05.161 --> 01:48:06.022]  Ben, thanks for holding.
[01:48:06.442 --> 01:48:06.842]  Yes, sir.
[01:48:07.042 --> 01:48:08.663]  Just three quick questions for you.
[01:48:08.843 --> 01:48:09.104]  Sure.
[01:48:09.524 --> 01:48:09.884]  Yes, sir.
[01:48:09.904 --> 01:48:16.888]  The first question, I made some flyers or whatever, promoting the 9-11 Truth Movement and telling people about the Federal Reserve.
[01:48:17.423 --> 01:48:20.585]  I was just wondering where somebody like me can hand those out?
[01:48:20.685 --> 01:48:23.807]  Can you stand outside Walmart and will they arrest you if you're on the sidewalk?
[01:48:23.847 --> 01:48:26.028]  Walmart is probably one of the worst places to go.
[01:48:26.048 --> 01:48:32.512]  I would go to the library, I would go to a local college, community college.
[01:48:33.552 --> 01:48:42.577]  I would just go, you know, walk through the halls to go to communal areas and just lay 20 copies down on each little area where that type of stuff is left.
[01:48:42.657 --> 01:48:45.219]  I'd put them up on bulletin boards.
[01:48:45.599 --> 01:48:49.861]  I would act confident while you're doing it like you own the place and you'll be left alone.
[01:48:50.321 --> 01:48:52.282]  Michael Rivero, I want to answer his first question.
[01:48:54.584 --> 01:48:55.764]  Which was the first question again?
[01:48:55.844 --> 01:48:57.945]  Well, we'll hold him over and get the other two.
[01:48:58.266 --> 01:49:00.947]  He was just mentioning where good places to fly are.
[01:49:01.770 --> 01:49:06.914]  Oh yeah, well, what you said is basically the college campuses, because for two reasons.
[01:49:07.775 --> 01:49:19.044]  The kids are going to look at the stuff, they're curious, they're there to learn, they're open to new experiences, and they are more likely to actually pick up and read and even redistribute the stuff that you put there in college campuses.
[01:49:19.744 --> 01:49:23.487]  Again, what you said about Walmart, that's not going to work.
[01:49:23.547 --> 01:49:26.950]  Those people aren't interested, they're there to buy something on sale.
[01:49:27.575 --> 01:49:38.739]  And those flyers tend to get thrown in the trash, or even worse, on the ground, which comes back and reflects on you and the organization, or the ideas you represent, reflect on very negatively.
[01:49:39.019 --> 01:49:40.940]  Yeah, good advice from Michael Rivero.
[01:49:41.020 --> 01:49:41.520]  Stay there.
[01:49:42.080 --> 01:49:43.321]  Ben, we'll come back when you've finished.
[01:49:43.381 --> 01:49:44.621]  And Nathaniel, and others.
[01:49:45.001 --> 01:49:46.882]  With Michael Rivero, I'm Alex Jones.
[01:49:54.082 --> 01:49:57.285]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[01:49:57.625 --> 01:49:59.567]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[01:49:59.927 --> 01:50:07.593]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:50:08.274 --> 01:50:15.319]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:50:15.719 --> 01:50:22.545]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spies,
[01:50:23.092 --> 01:50:27.153]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:50:27.433 --> 01:50:30.953]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:50:31.414 --> 01:50:33.334]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:50:33.654 --> 01:50:37.575]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:51:07.811 --> 01:51:12.012]  Cysts, parasites, and harmful or unwanted chemicals to below detectable levels.
[01:51:12.312 --> 01:51:16.234]  It also removes foul tastes and odors like that rotten egg smell of sulfide.
[01:51:16.454 --> 01:51:22.996]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals your body needs.
[01:51:23.216 --> 01:51:28.718]  The Berkey Light is so powerful it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lake streams and stagnant ponds.
[01:51:28.938 --> 01:51:35.580]  The Berkey Light is transparent and glows in the dark with its rechargeable LED lighting system so it can be used as a night light or camp

[01:51:51.801 --> 01:51:52.141]  I think so.
[01:52:07.006 --> 01:52:07.687]  We're good to go!
[01:52:36.565 --> 01:52:39.648]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.

[01:53:00.672 --> 01:53:07.216]  It is absolutely essential and coming up in the next hour I'm going to get into all the big new 9-11 developments and read excerpts from the L.A.
[01:53:07.256 --> 01:53:11.839]  Times and Village Voice today featuring my work and other great people's work.
[01:53:13.180 --> 01:53:14.001]  Individuals out there.
[01:53:14.081 --> 01:53:18.163]  Michael Rivero is going to ride shotgun with us about 15 minutes into the next hour.
[01:53:18.223 --> 01:53:20.585]  Later I'm going to play the Jackie Mason.
[01:53:20.645 --> 01:53:21.325]  I said Gleason.
[01:53:21.366 --> 01:53:22.206]  Jackie Gleason's dead.
[01:53:22.246 --> 01:53:22.626]  I know that.
[01:53:22.987 --> 01:53:24.127]  Jackie Mason defending
[01:53:25.760 --> 01:53:27.041]  Good old Mel Gibson.
[01:53:27.621 --> 01:53:32.565]  And then we'll also play some other clips from the news on a few other issues.
[01:53:33.065 --> 01:53:42.271]  But it is so important right now that everybody who's out there stay focused on the real 9-11 issues.
[01:53:42.671 --> 01:53:48.335]  The stuff that's cast iron, that can go through the fire, that can be scrutinized.
[01:53:48.695 --> 01:53:52.858]  Because I noticed early on the media will give unlimited attention to the Pentagon.
[01:53:53.468 --> 01:53:56.029]  Unlimited attention to no planes hitting the World Trade Centers.
[01:53:56.069 --> 01:53:57.129]  Totally made up, folks.
[01:53:57.630 --> 01:54:08.954]  They will give unlimited attention to every little wacky conspiracy theory, or even things that may be credible, but that you can't prove one way or the other, while they run from the hijackers being U.S.
[01:54:08.974 --> 01:54:17.377]  government agents, they run from CIA insider trading, they run from bombs in the buildings, they run from Bin Laden being a CIA asset.
[01:54:17.617 --> 01:54:19.478]  What else do they run from, Michael Rivera?
[01:54:20.373 --> 01:54:23.055]  Well, two issues really.
[01:54:23.575 --> 01:54:27.158]  One, of course, is the way in which World Trade Center Building No.
[01:54:27.178 --> 01:54:32.822]  7 collapsed straight down into its own footprint, looking exactly like a controlled demolition.
[01:54:33.222 --> 01:54:36.825]  Buildings just don't collapse that way on their own.
[01:54:37.304 --> 01:54:44.208]  Because in order for a building to come straight down like that, all the load-bearing members must be cut at exactly the same moment.
[01:54:44.368 --> 01:54:46.590]  Otherwise, the building will tip over to one side.
[01:54:46.970 --> 01:54:51.132]  And of course, World Trade Center 7 had never been hit by an airplane.
[01:54:51.152 --> 01:54:53.154]  There were only a few spot fires in it.
[01:54:53.914 --> 01:55:00.398]  And yet, every other steel frame building that has ever had a fire has burned right to the frame without actually collapsing.
[01:55:00.418 --> 01:55:01.058]  7 is the key!
[01:55:01.819 --> 01:55:03.280]  Yeah, 7 is definitely the key.
[01:55:03.600 --> 01:55:06.642]  And the other issue is one that I like to raise all the time, and that relates to
[01:55:07.504 --> 01:55:15.406]  President Bush down at Booker Elementary School where he's just sitting there reading about the goats after he's already been told about the second plane hitting the second tower.
[01:55:16.267 --> 01:55:21.788]  And everyone always tries to make excuses about why George Bush didn't want to upset the kids by running out of the room or anything.
[01:55:22.068 --> 01:55:25.329]  But the real key is the United States Secret Service protective detail.
[01:55:25.649 --> 01:55:34.212]  Now if you go back to the video that was shot of the assassination attempt on Ronald Reagan, you know how fast the Secret Service are trained to move when there is a threat to the President.
[01:55:34.645 --> 01:55:37.347]  Yet here we have the President sitting in this Booker School.
[01:55:37.727 --> 01:55:39.088]  Planes are flying overhead.
[01:55:39.148 --> 01:55:41.069]  Nobody knows how many because of the NORAD drills.
[01:55:41.349 --> 01:55:42.750]  They're crashing into buildings.
[01:55:43.350 --> 01:55:48.853]  Bush's presence at the school has been in the newspapers three days ahead of time, so everybody knows he's going to be there.
[01:55:49.113 --> 01:55:53.776]  There's an airport only four miles away, and yet the United States Secret Service detail
[01:55:54.474 --> 01:55:56.535]  Perfectly content to let Bush sit there.
[01:55:56.875 --> 01:55:58.436]  They know he's not in danger.
[01:55:58.656 --> 01:56:05.959]  Because it was a photo op so we could see the leader and so he couldn't be blamed later for not being in position to order shoot downs.
[01:56:07.399 --> 01:56:08.019]  That was that.
[01:56:08.039 --> 01:56:16.363]  He's just sitting there marking time for his speech but the inaction of the Secret Service proves they knew he was not a target that day and that means they had to know what the targets were.
[01:56:16.523 --> 01:56:19.684]  Well then if you look at how suspicious he looks while it's happening.
[01:56:20.464 --> 01:56:22.465]  I mean he, boy, he looks like a criminal.
[01:56:23.197 --> 01:56:25.281]  Boy, he'd make a lousy poker player, you know?
[01:56:25.321 --> 01:56:34.999]  I've been watching that face and, uh, you know, it's kind of interesting when he's up there making one of his speeches, if you turn off the sound and just watch his face and you say, I wouldn't even buy a used car from this man.
[01:56:36.010 --> 01:56:36.611]  Well, that's it.
[01:56:36.651 --> 01:56:38.472]  I mean, he's getting a crazed pleasure.
[01:56:38.853 --> 01:56:49.222]  You can tell he is containing energy, buoyant, excited energy, and he's got a crazed look on his eyes while it's going on, like, man, they're making me dictator.
[01:56:49.262 --> 01:56:50.883]  Daddy's doing it right now.
[01:56:51.444 --> 01:56:53.386]  Man, I'm getting it all.
[01:56:53.466 --> 01:56:55.227]  I'm going to be the first American dictator.
[01:56:55.648 --> 01:56:56.569]  You can tell, boy.
[01:56:56.589 --> 01:57:01.713]  Well, I hope he's the first American dictator to get kicked out by the American people.
[01:57:01.873 --> 01:57:02.534]  That's what I hope.
[01:57:04.089 --> 01:57:06.450]  Things would be a heck of a lot easier if this was a dictatorship.
[01:57:07.350 --> 01:57:09.211]  Just so long as I'm the dictator.
[01:57:10.511 --> 01:57:11.572]  I want a different dictator.
[01:57:11.612 --> 01:57:12.292]  Thank you very much.
[01:57:12.552 --> 01:57:13.272]  I hear you, Ben.
[01:57:13.332 --> 01:57:13.633]  Stay there.
[01:57:13.653 --> 01:57:15.793]  We'll let you finish up with Nathaniel, Mark, and Chris.
[01:57:15.813 --> 01:57:17.154]  That'll be the callers we have time for.
[01:57:17.474 --> 01:57:19.635]  With Michael Rivero, 15 minutes left with him.
[01:57:20.075 --> 01:57:23.896]  On the other side, then I've got a couple of audio clips I'm going to play and a bunch of other news we're going to be covering.
[01:57:23.916 --> 01:57:28.798]  I also want to ask Michael where he thinks this whole Israel crisis in Lebanon is going to end.
[01:57:30.709 --> 01:57:35.331]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[01:57:35.371 --> 01:57:35.851]  Big Brother.
[01:57:35.891 --> 01:57:36.811]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:36.851 --> 01:57:37.952]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:37.972 --> 01:57:43.354]  You want answers?
[01:57:43.494 --> 01:57:45.575]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:55.220 --> 01:57:58.921]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:57:59.401 --> 01:58:03.523]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:05.443 --> 01:58:07.504]  Monday through Friday, 11 to 2 p.m.
[01:58:07.544 --> 01:58:11.285]  Central Standard Time, back from 9 to midnight, Central Standard Time.
[01:58:11.325 --> 01:58:12.205]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:58:12.685 --> 01:58:17.827]  We now run a continual loop of my broadcast after it concludes each day at 2 p.m.
[01:58:17.847 --> 01:58:18.267]  Central.
[01:58:18.787 --> 01:58:21.748]  It restarts for you every single day.
[01:58:22.765 --> 01:58:26.626]  So 24 hours a day you can tune in, whether it's from 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:58:26.666 --> 01:58:31.808]  Central, or whether it's from 7 to 10 in the morning, or whether it's from 1 a.m.
[01:58:31.848 --> 01:58:43.432]  to 4 a.m., whatever time you like, we have thousands and thousands and thousands of streams that we now provide there for you to tune in whenever you'd like at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:58:43.452 --> 01:58:50.534]  We always remind listeners to help us spread the word and expand the reach of this broadcast as we battle for this constitutional republic.
[01:58:51.090 --> 01:58:53.732]  Okay, Ben in Florida, you had some more questions?
[01:58:53.772 --> 01:58:54.452]  Finish up with them.
[01:58:54.812 --> 01:58:55.173]  Yes, sir.
[01:58:55.193 --> 01:59:01.797]  My second question was, me and my friend, we want to go around and film and ask people what they know about the Constitution and tell them about their rights.
[01:59:02.257 --> 01:59:03.458]  Where's a good place to do that?
[01:59:03.778 --> 01:59:09.982]  And finally, how would somebody like me go about getting your documentaries on public access TV?
[01:59:10.922 --> 01:59:13.264]  Well, it depends on the access facility in your area.
[01:59:13.994 --> 01:59:41.251]  All you do is get my documentary films and on the website we've got a form authorizing you to air them on your facility for non-profit educational purposes and really you can just go sign on the form at most facilities that you have permission because you're being given it right now at the end of my film The Takeover on the video I say you can make copies of it and put it on AXS TV and so I mean that's really it and
[01:59:41.960 --> 01:59:52.907]  I suggest you do your own AXS television show and then go shoot those interviews with people and show how ignorant the public is about the Constitution and use that as an educational forum to wake the public up.
[01:59:52.947 --> 01:59:54.308]  Thank you for the call.
[01:59:54.688 --> 02:00:02.573]  I want to go to Nathaniel and others here in a moment, but Michael Rivero, speaking about the conflict in Palestine right now, how do you think it's going to end?
[02:00:02.593 --> 02:00:05.275]  I mean, clearly, Newt Gingrich, Crystal and others
[02:00:05.755 --> 02:00:09.577]  Our pushing for World War III is the best thing since mother's milk.
[02:00:10.557 --> 02:00:12.318]  How far do you see they're going to be able to go with this?
[02:00:13.299 --> 02:00:22.583]  Well, that's really going to be up to the American people and the people of the rest of the world, because they can push for World War III, but if the world says we're not interested, at some point there's going to be a breakdown in the effort.
[02:00:22.943 --> 02:00:27.326]  And it really is, unfortunately, going to come down to whoever wants what they want most.
[02:00:28.826 --> 02:00:34.109]  And unfortunately, the people who want war have a natural advantage, because they're willing to kill and lie and cheat and steal.
[02:00:34.802 --> 02:00:35.783]  To get what they want.
[02:00:36.163 --> 02:00:41.865]  The rest of us, all we have is simply the will to refuse to go along with these kind of things.
[02:00:42.926 --> 02:00:54.211]  What we are probably going to see is, obviously already on the political and media sense, the Israelis are losing the current conflict in Lebanon and in Palestine.
[02:00:54.591 --> 02:01:00.794]  World opinion has turned very much against them and by extension against the United States and Britain.
[02:01:02.270 --> 02:01:17.875]  Because of the attention on 9-11, and this is an interesting aspect to this whole deal, the doubt about 9-11 being focused on in the media may actually discourage the people who want World War III from attempting a new 9-11.
[02:01:19.336 --> 02:01:22.599]  And so the timing of all of these stories... Well, I totally agree with you.
[02:01:22.619 --> 02:01:23.699]  I mean, that's the timing.
[02:01:23.960 --> 02:01:34.567]  They've already set the stage in a bunch of stories, I've seen probably ten in the last two weeks, where they know Hezbollah's here in Hamas, and they're going to blow up major cities, and so martial law will be needed.
[02:01:34.927 --> 02:01:45.235]  I mean, I'm looking at the neocons to pull something, Michael, but you're saying all this doubt in the media may even be certain areas of the establishment having a war with themselves, or do you think it's organic?
[02:01:45.880 --> 02:01:49.862]  No, no, I think we're seeing a factionalization within the government itself.
[02:01:49.922 --> 02:02:00.989]  I think there's a lot of people who would see a second attempt at a 9-11 type as being the final straw that would break the government, simply because most people aren't ready to believe a new terror attack.
[02:02:01.029 --> 02:02:02.129]  They doubt the original one.
[02:02:02.630 --> 02:02:06.051]  If something were to happen right now, everybody's going to say, who benefits from this?
[02:02:06.092 --> 02:02:08.313]  Well, not the Lebanese, not the Palestinians.
[02:02:08.753 --> 02:02:12.235]  A new terror attack benefits the people who want to carry out these invasions.
[02:02:12.634 --> 02:02:14.855]  Everybody knows Bush wants to go into Iran.
[02:02:15.655 --> 02:02:16.075]  The U.S.
[02:02:16.295 --> 02:02:18.276]  government needs the Iran oil.
[02:02:18.316 --> 02:02:20.077]  They have not been able to get it out of Iraq.
[02:02:20.357 --> 02:02:23.338]  We just lost that huge field up in Alaska.
[02:02:23.878 --> 02:02:24.318]  The U.S.
[02:02:24.338 --> 02:02:29.760]  is going to start running out of oil soon unless they can invade a terror-sponsoring nation really, really soon.
[02:02:30.240 --> 02:02:32.841]  So, you know, that's obviously high on the agenda.
[02:02:34.301 --> 02:02:37.302]  I couldn't say it any better, and that's what we've been pushing for all these years.
[02:02:37.823 --> 02:02:42.064]  Expose 9-11, so we take that out of their arsenal so they do not continue to do it.
[02:02:45.905 --> 02:02:49.108]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[02:02:49.448 --> 02:02:51.370]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[02:02:51.770 --> 02:02:59.436]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:03:00.117 --> 02:03:07.142]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:03:07.562 --> 02:03:14.428]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying,
[02:03:14.935 --> 02:03:19.016]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:03:19.276 --> 02:03:22.776]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:03:23.237 --> 02:03:25.157]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:03:25.497 --> 02:03:29.398]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:03:42.862 --> 02:03:48.088]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[02:03:48.228 --> 02:03:56.318]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[02:03:56.578 --> 02:04:03.626]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[02:04:04.567 --> 02:04:11.071]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[02:04:11.251 --> 02:04:16.335]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[02:04:16.455 --> 02:04:25.321]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick and pets.
[02:04:25.601 --> 02:04:28.884]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5.
[02:04:30.985 --> 02:04:31.466]  We're good to go.
[02:04:42.526 --> 02:04:49.371]  In December 2005, CNN had a special documentary about the inevitability of nuclear terrorism on American soil.
[02:04:49.651 --> 02:04:55.215]  When the mainstream media is reporting on such a perilous topic with such candor, it should be taken very seriously.
[02:04:55.535 --> 02:05:02.099]  Currently for sale by owner, The Ultimate Secure Home is strategically located in the awesome mountains of southwest Colorado.
[02:05:02.319 --> 02:05:09.104]  This patented steel-reinforced concrete earth home was built to withstand any natural or man-made disaster you can name.
[02:05:09.364 --> 02:05:18.412]  Whether that be a forest fire, an earthquake, or even a full-scale nuclear attack, the house is completely off-grid with solar electricity and an independent water supply.
[02:05:18.652 --> 02:05:22.135]  It even has a hidden fallout shelter with NBC air filtration.
[02:05:22.435 --> 02:05:25.838]  Its many self-sufficient and high security features will amaze you.
[02:05:26.218 --> 02:05:33.542]  With nuclear World War III looming ever closer on the horizon, this custom survival home is turnkey, ready for a new owner.

[02:05:42.967 --> 02:05:48.030]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:05:48.371 --> 02:05:50.672]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:05:58.997 --> 02:06:01.598]  For over five years, I've been exposing 9-11.
[02:06:01.978 --> 02:06:02.398]  That's right.
[02:06:03.859 --> 02:06:12.462]  Two months before 9-11, I was on air telling you to call the White House and tell them, don't blow up the World Trade Centers, don't blame it on your asset or someone bin Laden.
[02:06:13.524 --> 02:06:16.926]  Since day one on the radio, since September 11th I've been exposing it.
[02:06:17.306 --> 02:06:23.929]  So has Michael Rivera, one of the few people out there who had the courage day one to be doing that, and we commend him for that work.
[02:06:24.230 --> 02:06:26.511]  And now we see the neocons in desperate trouble.
[02:06:27.031 --> 02:06:29.772]  We see their credibility evaporating on a thousand fronts.
[02:06:30.893 --> 02:06:32.474]  But that makes them more dangerous than ever.
[02:06:32.554 --> 02:06:35.876]  Don't think that they won't arrogantly shut a nuke off.
[02:06:35.956 --> 02:06:37.276]  I mean, they're that evil.
[02:06:37.316 --> 02:06:40.258]  They'll do something a hundred times bigger.
[02:06:41.048 --> 02:06:42.989]  A thousand times bigger than 9-11.
[02:06:43.009 --> 02:06:47.432]  These are cold-blooded killers who attacked us because they hate our freedom.
[02:06:47.852 --> 02:06:48.853]  They told us the truth.
[02:06:48.993 --> 02:06:56.057]  The terrorists attacked us because they wanted to take our freedoms and use us as their slaves to invade the world and take over the planet.
[02:06:56.837 --> 02:07:01.480]  And they're moving forward with their agenda, but they're meeting more and more resistance.
[02:07:02.301 --> 02:07:05.583]  Let's go ahead and go to Nathaniel in Texas.
[02:07:05.603 --> 02:07:06.223]  You're on the air.
[02:07:06.243 --> 02:07:06.663]  Go ahead.
[02:07:08.268 --> 02:07:22.201]  I was wondering if you knew anything about something a friend of mine was telling me on March 20th, supposedly Iran had done like allegedly Saddam had done and asked to be paid for their oil in Euros.
[02:07:23.223 --> 02:07:36.133]  Well, yes, they're moving to their own Iranian oil borscht or mercantile exchange where they will demand gold or euros or rubles, other currencies other than dollars.
[02:07:36.573 --> 02:07:37.954]  They haven't done that yet.
[02:07:38.034 --> 02:07:42.557]  The dollar is still the world reserve currency tied to petrol dollars.
[02:07:43.318 --> 02:07:46.180]  Let me get a response from Michael Rivero on your question.
[02:07:47.395 --> 02:08:06.268]  Well, I know Iran has been talking about it, and Iraq was starting to make that same move as well just before the invasion there, and the reason this is an issue is because the dollar is under tremendous stress and downward pressure, both from U.S.
[02:08:06.288 --> 02:08:14.214]  government borrowing, the trade imbalance, which is nearing $2 billion a day, because we don't manufacture our own products as much as we used to,
[02:08:15.121 --> 02:08:21.404]  And what keeps up foreign demand for dollars is to use as the oil currency of choice.
[02:08:21.884 --> 02:08:30.708]  Well, if nations start switching from using the dollar to the euro for their oil purchases, foreign demand for dollar will absolutely plummet.
[02:08:31.392 --> 02:08:35.213]  And without that support, the value of the dollar is definitely going to drop.
[02:08:35.293 --> 02:08:49.038]  And that's our fault, because we let the private banks take over in 1913, print the money, buy up the country with it, run us in the ground, and the outgoing head of the Fed, Greenspan, doubled the money supply in the last six.
[02:08:49.098 --> 02:08:53.019]  Now Bernanke, the new maniac, is saying they're going to double it in the next two.
[02:08:53.399 --> 02:08:56.340]  So basically, they've already devalued your currency, boys and girls.
[02:08:56.680 --> 02:08:59.521]  You just haven't come down from it yet, Michael.
[02:09:00.396 --> 02:09:06.421]  Yeah, if you really want to see how bad it's gotten, remember that silver dollars used to be worth one dollar.
[02:09:06.741 --> 02:09:12.726]  Well, go over to a coin store today and try and buy a silver dollar and see how many of the paper dollars it takes to own one.
[02:09:13.046 --> 02:09:16.248]  And that'll give you a real indication of just how bad it's gotten.
[02:09:16.629 --> 02:09:25.816]  The other thing to keep in mind is there are certain numbers that are put out by the Treasury Department, by the Federal Reserve rather, and one is called the M3 aggregate.
[02:09:26.112 --> 02:09:30.275]  And this is a number that simply represents how much money is in circulation total.
[02:09:30.695 --> 02:09:32.816]  Well, starting about two months ago, the U.S.
[02:09:32.836 --> 02:09:39.541]  government is no longer releasing that M3 aggregate number, which means that nobody really knows how much
[02:09:40.397 --> 02:09:41.999]  Total money is in circulation.
[02:09:42.019 --> 02:09:42.479]  That's right.
[02:09:42.559 --> 02:09:48.384]  Bernanke said, I'm going to double the money supply, but then he made it secret, which we've never done.
[02:09:49.024 --> 02:09:51.306]  Germany did that when they were in their Great Depression.
[02:09:51.366 --> 02:09:56.770]  So just so you know, ladies and gentlemen, everything you own basically is being devalued right now.
[02:09:57.010 --> 02:09:59.052]  The country is being totally bankrupt.
[02:09:59.512 --> 02:10:01.114]  And you've been hearing this for years.
[02:10:01.454 --> 02:10:02.955]  Well, now it's actually happening.
[02:10:03.215 --> 02:10:06.458]  And again, you can thank your good conservative leader, Lloyd Bush.
[02:10:07.461 --> 02:10:08.542]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:10:08.963 --> 02:10:20.195]  We are entering into a period of hyperinflation, and there's a lot of game playing to try and make the economy look like it's still good, like the recent frothing in the real estate market, although that's coming to an end.
[02:10:20.535 --> 02:10:30.045]  The Plunge Protection Team has been playing market rigging games to prevent the stock market from having a really obvious crash, but yet it continues a steady decline.
[02:10:30.379 --> 02:10:39.564]  And the bottom line is that these kind of games only get you so far because the bottom line is the United States is not making and selling products
[02:10:40.071 --> 02:10:44.653]  Going out the borders to equal the value and the cost of the products that we're bringing in.
[02:10:44.673 --> 02:10:51.555]  And the bottom line is we're a bunch of decadent nouveau riche scum injecting melted down dead babies into our lips.
[02:10:52.295 --> 02:10:58.737]  And you know, going to restaurants and prancing around and jogging and acting all fancy.
[02:10:58.997 --> 02:11:03.159]  And we're not number one anymore because a bunch of crooks took our government over and sucked it dry!
[02:11:03.960 --> 02:11:04.942]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:11:04.983 --> 02:11:07.869]  There's a saying that we have on one of the coffee mugs we sell at our website.
[02:11:08.149 --> 02:11:12.579]  The last official act of any government is to loot the nation, and I think we are definitely there.
[02:11:13.118 --> 02:11:28.766]  Yeah, I mean, folks, before they'd steal a few hundred billion a year out of defense coffers, you know, when we hear about trillions missing a year from the Pentagon, I always get emails by smarty-pants out there saying, well, the budget's only six hundred and something billion, how do they steal a trillion?
[02:11:29.087 --> 02:11:36.271]  Well, you had sixty-plus years of investments and investment funds and pensions and government investments in the stock market.
[02:11:36.551 --> 02:11:40.713]  That is all being liquidated the last six years, publicly disappearing,
[02:11:41.133 --> 02:11:45.137]  And then in the Congress, Rumsfeld gets asked about it, and he says, I'm not going to answer your question!
[02:11:45.377 --> 02:11:48.199]  I mean, they're openly stealing trillions right in front of us!
[02:11:49.640 --> 02:11:53.724]  Absolutely, and they're looting various trust funds.
[02:11:53.764 --> 02:11:55.705]  The Social Security is the most obvious one.
[02:11:56.786 --> 02:11:59.929]  All the cash that was set aside for the baby boomers' retirement is gone.
[02:11:59.989 --> 02:12:02.912]  It's been borrowed, and I put that in quote marks by the U.S.
[02:12:02.952 --> 02:12:05.534]  government, so there's nothing in there but IOUs.
[02:12:06.301 --> 02:12:08.442]  And there was the Indian Trust Fund.
[02:12:08.482 --> 02:12:10.623]  That one got looted and all that money went missing.
[02:12:10.923 --> 02:12:12.543]  That's still in litigation, I believe.
[02:12:13.003 --> 02:12:15.684]  There are all kinds of pension funds that are turning up short.
[02:12:17.165 --> 02:12:19.386]  And, you know, this money is going someplace.
[02:12:19.446 --> 02:12:22.307]  It's probably going outside the country for various golden parachutes.
[02:12:22.907 --> 02:12:26.148]  But it's literally the country is being stripped.
[02:12:26.288 --> 02:12:34.971]  And what a lot of Americans don't realize at this point is that all of our public lands that have been sort of locked away from us under the guise of environmentalism
[02:12:35.453 --> 02:12:37.836]  Those are the collateral on the government loans.
[02:12:52.854 --> 02:12:55.616]  And that's what our leaders are doing right now, folks.
[02:12:55.776 --> 02:13:02.059]  Understand, there's always been corruption, greed, avarice, bed-rigging, stealing, beak-dipping Mordido in this country.
[02:13:02.320 --> 02:13:11.185]  But now it has reached orgy-level, wild, slash-and-burn, strip-minding, giggling, gibbering wildness.
[02:13:12.045 --> 02:13:18.509]  Yeah, I think they realize it's not going to last much longer, so they're just stripping as much as they can from the carcass before it finally gives up breathing.
[02:13:18.911 --> 02:13:26.334]  But when the US government defaults, we're going to find all these foreign interests, foreign governments, foreign corporations, foreign lending bodies...
[02:13:26.676 --> 02:13:30.158]  Are going to own our national parks, our mineral-rich areas?
[02:13:30.178 --> 02:13:33.900]  Well, they're already announcing that foreign companies are taking over all the major roads.
[02:13:34.140 --> 02:13:39.503]  They've already got cartoon TV ads in Texas about the Texas Pass that will all be scanned.
[02:13:40.284 --> 02:13:42.345]  We beat the bill, but they're still running the ad, folks.
[02:13:42.365 --> 02:13:43.125]  They're not going to stop.
[02:13:43.566 --> 02:13:47.228]  I mean, Mexico's going to have major port facilities in the heartland.
[02:13:47.568 --> 02:13:48.728]  I mean, we're just gone.
[02:13:48.748 --> 02:13:51.190]  I don't think people realize we're gone.
[02:13:52.170 --> 02:13:57.494]  I mean, we can try to salvage something now, and people will just admit to themselves how far down we've gone.
[02:13:58.635 --> 02:14:07.462]  Yeah, unfortunately, it's going to get very, very ugly before it gets any better, and the only thing that is really going to stop this is for Americans to just get angry.
[02:14:07.562 --> 02:14:10.024]  It is time to get angry at what is going on.
[02:14:11.492 --> 02:14:32.586]  Here's the key, when it all implodes to a really obvious level with a big correction, or a stepping down of multiple corrections downward in a spiral, the very people that did this are going to be on TV blaming it on some hedge fund manager in Timbuktu who sold something a million short and caused the chain reaction.
[02:14:32.826 --> 02:14:37.409]  The person they send to prison will not be the reason this happened.
[02:14:37.984 --> 02:14:41.026]  Oh, absolutely, the scapegoats have already been chosen for this party.
[02:14:41.867 --> 02:14:46.950]  Oh yes, but don't worry, the public will suck their thumbs and worship the people that rape them as usual.
[02:14:47.450 --> 02:14:48.851]  Let's talk to BL in Texas.
[02:14:48.891 --> 02:14:51.994]  BL, you're on the air with Michael Rivera of WhatReallyHappened.com.
[02:14:53.154 --> 02:15:00.019]  Alex, Michael, you both made so many great points in the last hour, I just wish all the mindless sheeple could hear what you're saying.
[02:15:01.619 --> 02:15:15.647]  Last Saturday when they did the first re-air of the American Scholars Symposium from L.A., I happened to catch the Reichsfuhrer, George Bush, giving an interview about Lebanon.
[02:15:16.187 --> 02:15:17.248]  And I'm just outraged.
[02:15:17.308 --> 02:15:19.309]  I haven't heard anybody speak out about it.
[02:15:19.949 --> 02:15:29.575]  He was saying that we have to go in there, and I don't know whether that's a collective we or a royal we, but he says we have to go in there to Lebanon and rebuild their infrastructure.
[02:15:30.163 --> 02:15:32.264]  And New Orleans is still a shambles.
[02:15:34.245 --> 02:15:38.468]  Well Bush right now is saying that he doesn't want to cease fire.
[02:15:38.608 --> 02:15:40.569]  In fact, let me dig the actual AP headline out.
[02:15:40.949 --> 02:15:54.537]  Yeah, we've got to blow it all up and then send the IMF and World Bank in to basically turn it into a vassal state so Israel can start claiming that that's part of Israel and run their apartheid operation there.
[02:15:54.598 --> 02:15:55.198]  Michael Rivera?
[02:15:55.959 --> 02:16:09.247]  Yeah, absolutely, and the American people are getting screwed both times because we're paying for the bombs that are doing all the damage, and then we turn around and it's expected that we will pay to repair all the damage that the bombs did.
[02:16:09.828 --> 02:16:24.797]  So, I think the American people have to start looking at all this money that is going out of the country to these wars and to support Israel, and to repair the damage Israel is doing to its neighbors, and look pointedly at the lack of support for the Hurricane Katrina victims
[02:16:25.373 --> 02:16:33.237]  And just say there is something really screwed up because our government is clearly more concerned with what's going on in the Middle East than what they're doing right here at home.
[02:16:33.797 --> 02:16:36.078]  And that is a very, very bad way to run a country.
[02:16:36.198 --> 02:16:38.999]  I just thought of something that goes back to the economy imploding.
[02:16:39.400 --> 02:16:44.402]  Can you think of a crime wave we're going to have in this country if we have a serious recession or a depression?
[02:16:45.317 --> 02:16:46.098]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:16:46.138 --> 02:16:54.862]  There'll be people who are desperate to eat and you're going to have police departments' budgets being slashed like crazy.
[02:16:55.182 --> 02:17:04.607]  It'll be back to the Bonnie and Clyde kind of days, where banks get machine guns and the bank robbers just get across the county line because there's no more coordination.
[02:17:05.407 --> 02:17:09.029]  And yeah, it's going to go completely out of control.
[02:17:09.577 --> 02:17:17.765]  Gentlemen, I'm expecting, at the rate they're looting the country and printing money, I'm expecting Austrian inflation and gold to hit $3,000.
[02:17:20.407 --> 02:17:23.189]  Well, I don't care if gold goes up or down, I'm going to hold mine.
[02:17:23.370 --> 02:17:24.471]  Mike, you agree with that statement?
[02:17:25.071 --> 02:17:30.156]  Absolutely, and you know, definitely got to get prepared to weather this storm.
[02:17:31.186 --> 02:17:39.071]  The only reason gold is not going up now is central banks have been selling their gold reserves to keep gold prices down, to keep investors into the equities market.
[02:17:39.111 --> 02:17:40.852]  Tell you what, Michael, let's do five more minutes.
[02:17:40.872 --> 02:17:42.753]  You've got a break, but we'll see you in a few more.
[02:17:43.413 --> 02:17:45.274]  Dad, can we stop?
[02:17:45.614 --> 02:17:47.135]  We need to go to the bathroom.
[02:17:47.575 --> 02:17:47.835]  What?
[02:17:48.416 --> 02:17:48.696]  Again?
[02:17:49.474 --> 02:17:51.075]  We just stopped two hours ago.
[02:17:51.355 --> 02:17:52.596]  Honey, we better stop.
[02:17:52.796 --> 02:17:55.078]  I gave the kids their Sport Berkey water bottles.
[02:17:55.418 --> 02:17:56.699]  Why did you do that?
[02:17:56.979 --> 02:17:59.441]  Because they can't sip and talk at the same time.
[02:17:59.661 --> 02:18:02.523]  Or would you rather listen to them singing, Are we there yet?
[02:18:02.783 --> 02:18:03.804]  Are we there yet?
[02:18:03.864 --> 02:18:05.185]  For the entire trip.
[02:18:05.205 --> 02:18:07.607]  Hmm, I didn't think about that.
[02:18:08.107 --> 02:18:09.088]  Great idea.
[02:18:09.108 --> 02:18:12.010]  Yeah, and it's cheap entertainment for the kids.
[02:18:12.358 --> 02:18:14.840]  Bottled water costs around 75 cents a bottle.
[02:18:15.040 --> 02:18:19.463]  And using our Berkey Sport bottles, it costs us less than two and a half cents per refill.
[02:18:19.644 --> 02:18:21.765]  And we can purify water from the lake as well.
[02:18:22.025 --> 02:18:23.947]  Honey, you're terrific!
[02:18:24.487 --> 02:18:25.208]  I know, dear.
[02:18:25.508 --> 02:18:26.989]  Now find us a restroom.
[02:18:27.510 --> 02:18:28.390]  I need to stop too.
[02:18:28.570 --> 02:18:33.054]  Get your Berkey Sport purification bottle for only $39 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:18:33.094 --> 02:18:33.394]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:18:33.434 --> 02:18:34.995]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[02:18:48.163 --> 02:18:49.385]  Currency devaluation.
[02:18:49.705 --> 02:18:50.266]  Inflation.
[02:18:50.746 --> 02:18:51.427]  One and the same.
[02:18:52.168 --> 02:18:56.152]  If you had deposited $100,000 in a bank at 1% in a 30-month period dating from May 24, 2005, here is what happened to your funds.
[02:19:02.406 --> 02:19:05.548]  The dollar lost 33% of its value in that time frame.
[02:19:05.808 --> 02:19:07.629]  The bank paid you 1%.
[02:19:07.689 --> 02:19:10.710]  Your $100,000 now has a net purchasing power of $68,000.
[02:19:11.251 --> 02:19:13.472]  Here is reality.
[02:19:13.852 --> 02:19:17.414]  The devaluation of currency equals real inflation.
[02:19:17.914 --> 02:19:21.576]  Keep in mind how the value of your paper assets are measured in dollars.
[02:19:22.136 --> 02:19:24.657]  Gold in the same time frame increased 35% in value.

[02:19:46.191 --> 02:20:00.257]  Did you know that there's a secret group that has been trying to destroy all ordered government, eliminate private property, abolish inheritance, rid the nation of patriotism in the family, abolish religion, and establish a world government?
[02:20:00.898 --> 02:20:10.222]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening and more about Bible prophecy by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[02:20:42.392 --> 02:20:46.434]  People who use Cardivite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[02:20:46.654 --> 02:20:50.035]  For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself time-tested.
[02:20:50.235 --> 02:20:53.657]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite.
[02:20:53.965 --> 02:20:57.228]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[02:20:57.248 --> 02:21:02.713]  This basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the diseases that we've seen.
[02:21:02.733 --> 02:21:12.382]  When we do our program, you know, in herbal formulas like cardivite and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill now going for regular jobs a few months later, we know we're doing something right.
[02:21:12.502 --> 02:21:13.843]  It's a well thought out formula.
[02:21:13.883 --> 02:21:19.288]  I mean, the idea of it working on yeast and metals both at the same time and liver function is dead on.
[02:21:19.685 --> 02:21:25.669]  If you'll find I think that it'll work more than just on heart problems and circulation problems, it'll work on other problems as well.

[02:21:42.899 --> 02:21:56.268]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:21:56.989 --> 02:21:58.770]  Final segment with Michael Rivero.
[02:21:59.411 --> 02:22:02.313]  We're trying to make a point about the big central banks on record.
[02:22:02.333 --> 02:22:05.355]  It's in major financial publications at the Times of London.
[02:22:05.996 --> 02:22:15.643]  The big central banks will sell gold to each other back and forth each day at reduced prices to artificially keep the price of gold down.
[02:22:16.603 --> 02:22:24.809]  Though, going back over six years, the Asian countries began to traffic more and more in gold and have increased the demand.
[02:22:24.869 --> 02:22:32.494]  Now the Chinese in the last two years have begun allowing their population to own gold as they try to move some of their dollars into something real.
[02:22:33.054 --> 02:22:35.596]  So when do you see this bubble breaking, Michael Rivera?
[02:22:36.653 --> 02:22:48.376]  Well, I think when there's a major correction on the stock market, I think at that point you're going to see a lot of people trying to move back into gold very quickly, and that'll drive the price up.
[02:22:49.596 --> 02:22:55.338]  And I think at that point, the ability to artificially depress the price is going to break, and it's really going to skyrocket.
[02:22:55.358 --> 02:23:05.400]  And this goes back to your earlier caller, who said gold could easily hit $3,000, which is a combination not only of the demand for gold going up, but the actual worth of the dollar being in decline.
[02:23:06.145 --> 02:23:14.230]  And that gets back to that experiment I suggested, which is go to a coin store and buy a silver dollar and see how many paper dollars it takes to purchase that.
[02:23:14.250 --> 02:23:16.552]  Well, just four or five years ago, they were like $5.
[02:23:16.612 --> 02:23:18.453]  Then they were $10.
[02:23:18.533 --> 02:23:23.476]  Now they're $12 or $14, even if they don't have any collector value to them.
[02:23:23.536 --> 02:23:26.198]  So it really shows what's happening to our dollar.
[02:23:26.218 --> 02:23:28.539]  But look, the stock market hit its peak of $11,000-something.
[02:23:30.842 --> 02:23:36.746]  Yeah, that's one of the difficulties of trying to figure out what's going on with the economy is you have the underlying worth of the dollar
[02:23:54.880 --> 02:23:56.320]  Has to be factored into it.
[02:23:57.061 --> 02:23:58.621]  And most of the U.S.
[02:23:58.661 --> 02:24:03.963]  figures basically treat the dollar as an absolute measure, going back to the Bretton Woods Agreement.
[02:24:04.623 --> 02:24:05.903]  And yet here you have the U.S.
[02:24:05.963 --> 02:24:11.304]  government, or the Federal Reserve, continuing to print out additional cash to inflate that supply.
[02:24:12.085 --> 02:24:18.166]  Clearly, the assumptions of Bretton Woods are a formality, but they don't match reality.
[02:24:18.967 --> 02:24:24.288]  And the government can very easily throw tons and tons of money at the population,
[02:24:24.733 --> 02:24:33.520]  So that it feels like we have more dollars in numbers, but if you look at what those dollars can actually buy, you realize... I mean, look at the price of homes now.
[02:24:33.660 --> 02:24:36.903]  When I was in high school, a three-bedroom home in California went for $40,000.
[02:24:37.223 --> 02:24:42.667]  Now, the equivalent home is $800,000 is the median price for such a house.
[02:24:43.208 --> 02:24:53.856]  So, given that the house has not really changed, given that the land has not really changed, that tells you a good measure of what the inflation has done to the value of the dollar.
[02:24:54.488 --> 02:25:09.036]  Well, you talk to these yuppies who've got degrees and they think they're so smart, and they think the economy's great, they think that their stock market is wonderful, they don't even know that the Dow, top 30 stocks, takes the losers out and only puts winners in it.
[02:25:09.596 --> 02:25:11.457]  You look at the Nasdaq, it's the same.
[02:25:11.497 --> 02:25:17.141]  You look at the Standard & Poor's, it's all being manipulated on its face!
[02:25:18.101 --> 02:25:21.923]  Yeah, the Dow Jones averages and everything are simply indicator stocks.
[02:25:21.983 --> 02:25:23.304]  It doesn't calculate all of them.
[02:25:23.872 --> 02:25:27.075]  And stocks that don't perform well are taken out of the indications.
[02:25:27.816 --> 02:25:38.325]  And when the plunge protection team goes in to try and make the stock market look good, it is specifically the indicator stocks that they target with put options to run them up.
[02:25:38.646 --> 02:25:41.788]  Now, see, for those that don't know, you know, we're talking to the choir here.
[02:25:41.848 --> 02:25:42.889]  We have a lot of folks who don't know.
[02:25:43.150 --> 02:25:50.096]  The Federal Reserve is in there pumping hundreds of billions sometimes in a week into the stock market, manipulating it.
[02:25:51.053 --> 02:25:57.095]  Yeah, basically to keep it up, because for a lot of people that stock market has become the banner of the economy.
[02:25:57.395 --> 02:26:05.298]  And this began actually back during the Clinton administration, when even Clinton was looting Social Security and putting the money in the General Fund.
[02:26:05.618 --> 02:26:08.599]  That's where he got his declaration, we have a budget surplus.
[02:26:08.939 --> 02:26:13.501]  Well, it was a budget surplus built on the cash they took out of the Social Security Trust Fund.
[02:26:13.841 --> 02:26:17.522]  And they took a lot of that money and they pumped it into the stock market to drive it up.
[02:26:17.972 --> 02:26:19.733]  Because that was their political banner.
[02:26:19.853 --> 02:26:21.454]  It's the economy, it's the economy.
[02:26:21.514 --> 02:26:22.975]  Look how good those numbers are going.
[02:26:22.995 --> 02:26:30.218]  Yeah, so as long as, I mean, it's like putting a nice, clear paint of coat, you know, I mean, nice new paint job on a junker car.
[02:26:31.199 --> 02:26:33.160]  Yeah, that's... Sorry.
[02:26:33.800 --> 02:26:35.101]  Yeah, no, you're exactly correct.
[02:26:35.481 --> 02:26:42.625]  It was all for appearances, and as a result, since then, the stock market indicator numbers are far less accurate.
[02:26:43.024 --> 02:26:45.867]  I just want people to know that we're not trying to give you gloom and doom here.
[02:26:45.887 --> 02:26:48.410]  Every major real indices, every real indicator, every measure shows a society
[02:26:59.492 --> 02:27:08.498]  In rapid, accelerated decline, and the government indicates that it knows that by the mad looting, it's scary, Michael Rivero.
[02:27:08.559 --> 02:27:15.303]  We always appreciate you coming in and giving us your great insight and your decades of work against this corruption.
[02:27:15.323 --> 02:27:27.252]  You know, that's another reason for them to have World War III cooking, is they may be concerned about a stock market plunge, and just like right before 9-11 we saw a major correction, they may use a terror attack to smokescreen that in the minds of the people.
[02:27:27.532 --> 02:27:28.873]  We'll talk to you next month, Michael.
[02:27:29.466 --> 02:27:30.007]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:27:30.268 --> 02:27:30.729]  God bless.
[02:27:30.769 --> 02:27:31.330]  We'll be right back.
[02:27:33.335 --> 02:27:34.217]  We're on the march.
[02:27:34.718 --> 02:27:36.321]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:37.243 --> 02:27:39.949]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:44.409 --> 02:27:46.990]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here with an important question.
[02:27:47.130 --> 02:27:49.291]  When was the last time you used pure soap?

[02:28:44.154 --> 02:28:45.174]  Good morning, honey.
[02:28:45.534 --> 02:28:51.596]  Wow, the weather is beautiful, the cabin is terrific, and it's the first day of our vacation!
[02:28:51.876 --> 02:28:52.516]  Yeah.
[02:28:52.896 --> 02:28:54.257]  Honey, is there something wrong?
[02:28:54.679 --> 02:28:58.121]  Yeah, I just realized we forgot to pack the travel Berkey system.
[02:28:58.602 --> 02:29:00.083]  I can't drink this cabin water.
[02:29:00.583 --> 02:29:02.304]  And what am I going to do when I'm out on the lake?
[02:29:02.685 --> 02:29:04.486]  Now the whole vacation is ruined.
[02:29:04.686 --> 02:29:05.607]  Honey, cheer up!
[02:29:05.987 --> 02:29:08.268]  I brought our sport Berkey purifiers!
[02:29:08.549 --> 02:29:08.869]  What?

[02:29:20.217 --> 02:29:20.457]  You know,

[02:29:22.624 --> 02:29:23.385]  And wow!
[02:29:23.665 --> 02:29:25.126]  Have you noticed the beautiful weather?
[02:29:25.567 --> 02:29:26.728]  Don't ruin your vacation.

[02:29:42.603 --> 02:29:49.888]  United States Pharmacopeia, USP, sets the standard for most food supplements and are used in over 95% of all vitamin and mineral supplements in the world.
[02:29:50.068 --> 02:29:53.110]  The problem is that these products have never appeared in any living tissue.
[02:29:53.230 --> 02:29:56.592]  They're created in laboratories and are not recognizable to the body's metabolism.
[02:29:57.052 --> 02:30:05.958]  Grown by Nature products are different because they use re-natured ingredients, proprietary blends of essential vitamins and minerals, with co-factors of proteins, lipids, and complex carbohydrates.
[02:30:06.338 --> 02:30:06.678]  I think so.
[02:30:26.988 --> 02:30:27.448]  We're good to go.
[02:30:52.557 --> 02:31:10.452]  I've never hidden the fact that I'm a fan of Mel Gibson.
[02:31:10.872 --> 02:31:13.475]  And I'm also a friend of the family.
[02:31:15.496 --> 02:31:19.700]  And everybody I know that knows Mel Gibson really well says that he never says bad things
[02:31:20.629 --> 02:31:22.990]  About any racial or religious group.
[02:31:25.351 --> 02:31:28.012]  And the whole thing that we've seen has turned into a big media circus.
[02:31:28.032 --> 02:31:31.133]  I have really stayed away from it, because it is a distraction.
[02:31:31.153 --> 02:31:32.093]  It is a diversion.
[02:31:33.194 --> 02:31:40.957]  And, you know, I know that Jackie Mason is a comedian, and it's a little bit racy, but it was on Fox News, the big Christian channel, supposedly.
[02:31:40.977 --> 02:31:49.220]  I'm not being sarcastic or anything, but... But here's, I guess, Cavuto defending Gibson, which is... Fox is just weird.
[02:31:49.921 --> 02:32:02.070]  You know, they will sit there and attack people for absolutely nothing, and then Gibson does something that's admittedly distasteful, and I'm not defending him, Gibson's not defending him, but the whole thing looks like a set-up.
[02:32:02.170 --> 02:32:04.672]  I mean, where is free speech in this country?
[02:32:04.732 --> 02:32:06.934]  It really is being hyped up like it's some type of crime.
[02:32:06.954 --> 02:32:10.916]  I don't know, it's just strange to hear something like this on Fox.
[02:32:11.137 --> 02:32:18.022]  So, this is the comedian Jackie Mason on Cavuto's World on Fox.
[02:32:18.945 --> 02:32:21.547]  Again, it's Jews way too seriously.
[02:32:21.967 --> 02:32:23.608]  Exactly why is Jackie so forgiving?
[02:32:24.509 --> 02:32:25.410]  Why are you so forgiving?
[02:32:25.550 --> 02:32:26.230]  I'll be honest with you.
[02:32:26.250 --> 02:32:27.391]  It's not that I'm so forgiving.
[02:32:27.451 --> 02:32:28.952]  It's that all these people are very sick.
[02:32:28.972 --> 02:32:33.115]  They're getting a vicious, sick, perverted, sadistic thrill out of this whole thing.
[02:32:33.415 --> 02:32:34.476]  Look at the glee in them.
[02:32:34.516 --> 02:32:36.377]  Look at the happiness about catching them.
[02:32:36.678 --> 02:32:39.740]  Because they're all basically failures, but they never amounted to anything.
[02:32:40.320 --> 02:32:40.780]  What is it?
[02:32:40.801 --> 02:32:47.105]  Actors who are struggling to make a living, and they've always been envious and bitter and jealous of a guy who makes such a huge success.
[02:32:47.465 --> 02:32:51.828]  So now, in the guise of being a great crusader against anti-Semitism, they found an excuse.
[02:32:52.228 --> 02:32:59.093]  It's all an excuse, a rationalization, a phony excuse to bury this guy, because they're enjoying it with such a sick, perverted pleasure.
[02:32:59.113 --> 02:33:01.795]  But he did say a lot of nasty things.
[02:33:01.915 --> 02:33:03.476]  As a Jew, how do you feel about it?
[02:33:03.516 --> 02:33:04.957]  Now, let me be very honest with you.
[02:33:05.017 --> 02:33:06.398]  Nobody can excuse these remarks.
[02:33:06.778 --> 02:33:12.360]  But do you ever take it so seriously when a guy is drunk and a stupid is laying on the floor and he says some ridiculous things?
[02:33:12.600 --> 02:33:14.560]  People curse their own mother in a stage like that.
[02:33:14.580 --> 02:33:16.341]  They tell their whole family to drop dead.
[02:33:16.601 --> 02:33:19.402]  I mean, the whole family would be going to a cemetery by Thursday.
[02:33:19.422 --> 02:33:23.783]  But nevertheless, they say it's a truth serum.
[02:33:23.803 --> 02:33:24.303]  You don't buy that?
[02:33:24.323 --> 02:33:25.363]  They say it's a truth serum.
[02:33:25.383 --> 02:33:26.404]  You gotta be a moron.
[02:33:26.624 --> 02:33:30.745]  You gotta be the phoniest, wretched fraud in the world to claim that it's a truth serum.
[02:33:31.085 --> 02:33:35.486]  If it's your family or your friends and they say something in a drunken state, you say he was drunk and you forget about it.
[02:33:35.506 --> 02:33:37.887]  In a drunken state, you might bang your head against the wall.
[02:33:37.927 --> 02:33:39.308]  Does that mean you really want to break your head?
[02:33:39.788 --> 02:33:41.888]  You might go into a car... You're not bitter toward them.
[02:33:41.908 --> 02:33:42.809]  I want to ask you a question.
[02:33:42.829 --> 02:33:46.190]  Did you ever notice how people beg a guy not to drive when he's drunk and he drives anyway?
[02:33:46.210 --> 02:33:49.211]  Because he doesn't even know he's drunk and he doesn't even know he shouldn't be driving.
[02:33:49.551 --> 02:33:51.912]  And he doesn't even know that ten seconds later, he's dead.
[02:33:52.332 --> 02:33:53.592]  That's a very good point.
[02:33:53.632 --> 02:33:59.354]  Now, if you want to kill yourself, does that prove that you really, if you gave him a gun, he would kill himself?
[02:34:00.264 --> 02:34:00.905]  He gave him a gun.
[02:34:00.945 --> 02:34:05.629]  I don't think he'd kill himself, but he's too sick and drunk to know that he's about to kill himself.
[02:34:05.909 --> 02:34:07.030]  I want to ask you a question.
[02:34:07.470 --> 02:34:08.891]  These people are attacking him.
[02:34:08.931 --> 02:34:10.512]  They're all saying the same thing in Hollywood.
[02:34:10.572 --> 02:34:11.933]  I would never wipe with him again.
[02:34:11.953 --> 02:34:13.034]  These are all failures.
[02:34:13.074 --> 02:34:14.135]  I've never wiped with him before.
[02:34:14.395 --> 02:34:15.516]  He never asked them to wipe with him.
[02:34:15.556 --> 02:34:16.177]  He don't need them.
[02:34:16.517 --> 02:34:21.121]  He makes a fortune that they can't get a job, but they're threatening him that they won't wipe with him again.
[02:34:21.681 --> 02:34:22.421]  This is jealousy.
[02:34:22.922 --> 02:34:25.983]  Jealousy and hate and contempt for a guy who's doing too good.
[02:34:26.683 --> 02:34:29.565]  Also with this guy, Foxman, this head of the ADL.
[02:34:29.645 --> 02:34:31.346]  I'm not a fake from top to bottom.
[02:34:31.366 --> 02:34:32.266]  I don't talk about people.
[02:34:32.306 --> 02:34:33.086]  It's not my nature.
[02:34:35.567 --> 02:34:36.488]  He's a total fake.
[02:34:36.528 --> 02:34:37.388]  Let's be honest about it.
[02:34:37.448 --> 02:34:45.312]  Anybody who makes a life out of fighting racism, in effect, has to blow up racism in order to justify himself for the job he has.
[02:34:45.632 --> 02:34:47.133]  Otherwise, he'd have to go to work.
[02:34:47.233 --> 02:34:49.374]  Otherwise, he'd have to get up in the morning and get a real job.
[02:34:52.609 --> 02:34:58.175]  He wants to... ABC has already cut plans to co-produce his Holocaust special.
[02:34:58.496 --> 02:34:59.036]  So that's out.
[02:34:59.457 --> 02:35:02.680]  Is he going to have any ill effects from all of this in Hollywood?
[02:35:02.780 --> 02:35:05.764]  He might have ill effects because people love burying a guy who's big.
[02:35:06.064 --> 02:35:08.567]  If a guy on a bicycle breaks down, you cry for him.
[02:35:08.627 --> 02:35:10.449]  If he breaks down on the Rolls Royce, you applaud.
[02:35:11.266 --> 02:35:20.033]  People who make a living from fighting anti-semitism, like Al Sharpton, and from fighting racism, they have to convince themselves there's racism every place.
[02:35:20.553 --> 02:35:23.955]  And that every minute they're about to blow up every Jew in America.
[02:35:24.196 --> 02:35:26.437]  Because otherwise he would have to go to work for a living.
[02:35:26.477 --> 02:35:29.279]  He fears a job a lot more than he fears anti-semitism.
[02:35:29.319 --> 02:35:32.302]  Getting up in the morning is the main fear that Foxman has.
[02:35:32.582 --> 02:35:35.244]  And all of a sudden he made himself the judge and the jury of this man.
[02:35:35.264 --> 02:35:36.044]  There were a lot of people.
[02:35:36.064 --> 02:35:37.005]  There was that real quick
[02:35:37.105 --> 02:35:44.547]  There was that rabbi who suggested that maybe Mel Gibson should apologize to his congregation on Yom Kippur.
[02:35:44.667 --> 02:35:45.087]  You know why?
[02:35:45.107 --> 02:35:59.430]  Because nobody knows who this rabbi is, who cares who he is, all of a sudden he becomes a producer, all of a sudden he's producing a show with him and Mel Gibson, and he'll become the star of the show, and then you'll see it in the newspapers, starring Rabbi Schwartz with Mel Gibson, and he'll probably get second belief.
[02:36:00.491 --> 02:36:02.576]  Because it's another rabbi looking for attention.
[02:36:02.836 --> 02:36:05.602]  They decided they're the judge and jury of this whole situation.
[02:36:05.903 --> 02:36:07.626]  They've become a personal mafia now.
[02:36:08.428 --> 02:36:09.610]  Because who knows who they are?
[02:36:09.731 --> 02:36:10.793]  Who would pay attention to them?
[02:36:11.505 --> 02:36:13.426]  Foxman and this other guy are loving it.
[02:36:13.466 --> 02:36:16.647]  They're threatening him every day about how much he apologizes.
[02:36:16.667 --> 02:36:22.370]  So Jews who are speaking out against... Well, there are some Jews who aren't in that camp who are just legitimately offended.
[02:36:22.390 --> 02:36:23.790]  You say they should get over themselves?
[02:36:23.830 --> 02:36:26.151]  They're nuts if they're offended.
[02:36:26.972 --> 02:36:28.913]  You're offended if you know anything about his life.
[02:36:29.413 --> 02:36:33.094]  His life has been a mecca of decency all of his life.
[02:36:33.134 --> 02:36:35.235]  He never offended a Jew in his life, personally.
[02:36:35.775 --> 02:36:37.976]  How a guy lived for 50 years is what you count.
[02:36:38.016 --> 02:36:39.157]  Not one remark when you're drunk.
[02:36:39.717 --> 02:36:41.719]  He never joined a club with his anti-Semitic.
[02:36:41.759 --> 02:36:44.841]  He never refused to give a guy a tip at a restaurant because he found out he's Jewish.
[02:36:45.561 --> 02:36:48.143]  His house doesn't have a sign in front of it that says, no Jews allowed.
[02:36:48.423 --> 02:36:50.725]  What did he ever do that's anti-Jewish in his life?
[02:36:50.785 --> 02:36:54.027]  A whole 50 years of decency doesn't count because you made one remark.
[02:36:54.387 --> 02:36:56.789]  Now they say he apologized, but he didn't apologize enough.
[02:36:56.829 --> 02:36:58.370]  He should apologize a little higher.
[02:36:58.710 --> 02:37:00.051]  He should have apologized in the morning.
[02:37:00.071 --> 02:37:01.332]  He only apologized at night.
[02:37:01.392 --> 02:37:02.953]  He should have apologized when he was sitting.
[02:37:02.993 --> 02:37:04.474]  He should have gotten up to apologize.
[02:37:09.477 --> 02:37:09.977]  All right, folks.
[02:37:35.902 --> 02:37:37.142]  I mean, that's really true.
[02:37:37.602 --> 02:38:00.706]  I mean, the bigger offense here, somebody says on the side of the highway, now they need to be ruined and their life is supposedly over, and oh my gosh, because he was in some weird conversation with this cop, and I think it's all a setup, we're not hearing what the cop said, and then he says that Jews are behind all the wars in the world.
[02:38:00.746 --> 02:38:01.967]  Now, I don't agree with that.
[02:38:02.627 --> 02:38:02.887]  Okay?
[02:38:02.927 --> 02:38:03.947]  And most people don't.
[02:38:04.597 --> 02:38:09.858]  I think they're behind a lot of wars in the Middle East, and they've got a big military, and they're certainly pushing this war with Lebanon.
[02:38:10.998 --> 02:38:12.218]  And Hezbollah loves it, too.
[02:38:12.238 --> 02:38:13.799]  I mean, they need a war, too.
[02:38:13.819 --> 02:38:16.299]  They're like a foxman who needs a war.
[02:38:16.339 --> 02:38:20.280]  I mean, I think both sides are out of control here, but Israel is the bully.
[02:38:20.620 --> 02:38:23.880]  They are the big dog on the block who's picking on the little chihuahua.
[02:38:25.041 --> 02:38:32.982]  But the way they've been treating Mel Gibson is very, very, very suspicious.
[02:38:33.752 --> 02:38:35.933]  And that this whole thing stinks to high heaven.
[02:38:36.513 --> 02:38:38.334]  And I agree with Jackie Mason.
[02:38:39.355 --> 02:38:40.555]  He's absolutely right.
[02:38:41.355 --> 02:38:44.917]  And really, in the final equation, this will create more racism.
[02:38:45.577 --> 02:38:52.540]  I mean, frankly, if it wasn't for the ADL always running around talking about how Jews are getting persecuted, I wouldn't even have known about all this.
[02:38:53.321 --> 02:38:58.723]  I mean, I wasn't even brought up that this is a Jew, that's not a Jew, this is what Jews are doing.
[02:38:59.643 --> 02:39:00.884]  I mean, I'm really sick of it.
[02:39:01.904 --> 02:39:03.665]  Personally, I'm tired of everything.
[02:39:03.885 --> 02:39:04.806]  It's an obsession.
[02:39:06.527 --> 02:39:10.328]  I mean, I've asked Jewish friends of mine, it's like, what is it like to be the center of attention?
[02:39:11.149 --> 02:39:13.070]  I mean, it's really got to get old.
[02:39:14.070 --> 02:39:19.413]  And meanwhile, you've got a scumbag like Schwarzenegger, who's a real live Nazi.
[02:39:20.734 --> 02:39:29.078]  I mean, all the things he did, handing out Hitler records and saying he loves Hitler, and they've got tapes of it, but because he pays off the ADL, they say he's great.
[02:39:29.933 --> 02:39:36.878]  Meanwhile, the Bushes made their money off Hitler, but that's okay, because he's in bed with the people in Israel now, so it's okay.
[02:39:38.279 --> 02:39:44.004]  Let's crucify Mel Gibson, who I'm sure is mad how he got demonized during the Passion of the Christ.
[02:39:44.424 --> 02:39:45.585]  You know that's in the back of his head.
[02:39:46.185 --> 02:39:57.534]  The way he got attacked, the way he got threatened, the death threats they got, all the things that happened, the way his family got attacked, and then somebody brought something up at that bar, or that cop did, and then he just goes off and says, I don't know,
[02:39:58.456 --> 02:39:59.776]  I've made my statement on it.
[02:40:00.037 --> 02:40:03.538]  We're in the middle of World War III, possibly starting, and it really doesn't matter.
[02:40:03.838 --> 02:40:05.638]  But the media has made it important.
[02:40:07.359 --> 02:40:08.259]  I know we've got a bunch of callers.
[02:40:08.279 --> 02:40:18.302]  We'll try to take them in the final segment, but I've got almost two and a half, three hours today, what, two hours, 42 minutes into this broadcast, and I haven't plugged anything yet, really.
[02:40:20.723 --> 02:40:26.145]  The way I fund my operation, the way we have our everyday business, is that you get my videos.
[02:40:27.481 --> 02:40:29.502]  And we ship them out to you UPS Ground.
[02:40:29.522 --> 02:40:33.045]  So you should get it very quickly after you order from us.
[02:40:33.505 --> 02:40:34.266]  Unless you have a P.O.
[02:40:34.306 --> 02:40:39.229]  Box and you have to ship to United Postal Service.
[02:40:39.609 --> 02:40:41.190]  And they are an absolute nightmare.
[02:40:41.290 --> 02:40:42.771]  But you should get that in a few weeks.
[02:40:43.272 --> 02:40:47.475]  If you so choose to use regular mail.
[02:40:48.675 --> 02:40:49.956]  But none of that really matters.
[02:40:50.577 --> 02:40:51.978]  I have made 15 films.
[02:40:52.018 --> 02:40:53.739]  My newest, Terror Storm, is out.
[02:40:54.537 --> 02:40:57.181]  It is my best work and you really need to have it.
[02:40:57.622 --> 02:41:04.052]  I carry a bunch of other books and videos by other wonderful authors and researchers and filmmakers at InfoWars.com.
[02:41:06.485 --> 02:41:09.446]  And that's how you support us, but that's secondary.
[02:41:09.546 --> 02:41:31.392]  Number one, these are powerful videos and books that will inform you to a level of excellence so you can articulately articulate the information that exposes 9-11 as an inside job, or the growing casual society control grid, why RFID is bad, why the face scanning cameras are bad, what's happening to our sovereignty.
[02:41:31.452 --> 02:41:32.692]  I mean, my films cover this.
[02:41:34.150 --> 02:41:38.713]  Whether it's Martial Law, Road to Tyranny, Terror Storm, Order of Death.
[02:41:39.333 --> 02:41:42.995]  I've got a bunch of specials where you can get my videos as low as $5.95 apiece.
[02:41:43.015 --> 02:41:46.998]  Where you can get t-shirts for $9.95 apiece.
[02:41:47.018 --> 02:41:51.160]  I mean a lot of this stuff is going out at very near cost.
[02:41:51.581 --> 02:41:53.282]  We have a mission here.
[02:41:54.282 --> 02:41:56.223]  Our mission is to wake people up.
[02:41:56.684 --> 02:42:01.166]  Our mission is to stop the next terror attack by exposing who carried out the last one.
[02:42:01.827 --> 02:42:03.688]  Our mission is frankly to survive now.
[02:42:04.315 --> 02:42:05.857]  I'm so far into this, folks.
[02:42:06.037 --> 02:42:11.504]  I'm like a spaceship leaving Earth, going to another star system, and I've spent my fuel.
[02:42:11.864 --> 02:42:13.026]  I can't turn around.
[02:42:13.046 --> 02:42:17.371]  I have got to go to the new Valhalla.
[02:42:18.052 --> 02:42:18.993]  I've got to get there.
[02:42:19.053 --> 02:42:20.475]  I've got to go to the Promised Land.
[02:42:20.915 --> 02:42:22.838]  I've got to make it to my destination.
[02:42:23.709 --> 02:42:24.670]  I'll use a better analogy.
[02:42:24.690 --> 02:42:29.414]  I'm like a sailing ship that's run out of provisions and doesn't have any sails.
[02:42:29.434 --> 02:42:37.682]  They've been torn off by storms and I'm in the waters of where this fabled island is I'm trying to reach and I can't turn around.
[02:42:37.762 --> 02:42:39.504]  I can't even control my boat.
[02:42:40.345 --> 02:42:42.407]  All I can do is just hope I can make it there.
[02:42:42.807 --> 02:42:44.389]  And we're all in this boat together.
[02:42:44.469 --> 02:42:45.530]  I hope you realize that.
[02:42:45.590 --> 02:42:48.913]  I mean, you know, I'm thinking about
[02:42:50.208 --> 02:42:51.869]  What martial law is going to be like?
[02:42:51.929 --> 02:42:55.451]  I'm thinking about what I'm going to do if the globalists end up winning.
[02:42:55.791 --> 02:42:57.311]  I'm really counting the cost here.
[02:42:57.752 --> 02:42:59.052]  We know how real this is.
[02:42:59.492 --> 02:43:00.793]  We've shattered the matrix.
[02:43:02.374 --> 02:43:03.935]  We can bring these people down.
[02:43:04.035 --> 02:43:06.976]  The glee I have, the pleasure, the relish.
[02:43:08.388 --> 02:43:26.901]  That I have, when I know that because of you getting Terror Storm, and Road to Tyranny, and Martial Law, and America Destroyed by Design, and aggressively making copies every day of them, and giving them to friends and families and neighbors, and waking people up, that we are really hurting the New World Order right now.
[02:43:27.662 --> 02:43:32.005]  We are having a massive effect right now because of you!
[02:43:32.025 --> 02:43:35.127]  So I ask those that already have my films,
[02:43:37.051 --> 02:43:40.474]  Who thought they were informative, who researched them and found out that they were accurate.
[02:43:41.635 --> 02:43:44.117]  If you haven't made copies yet, make copies!
[02:43:45.878 --> 02:43:51.343]  Or, if you haven't gotten the videos, get my newest and most powerful film ever, Terror Storm.
[02:43:52.303 --> 02:44:01.611]  Make about ten copies of it, give it to friends and family, tell them that if they find it to be intriguing and informative, that they should make copies and give it to others.
[02:44:02.011 --> 02:44:05.274]  And so on and so forth, it is unbelievable.
[02:44:05.314 --> 02:44:06.595]  We've done the math before, but
[02:44:07.302 --> 02:44:13.286]  A hundred videos, if a certain amount of copies are made by those that get them, turns into millions of videos.
[02:44:13.646 --> 02:44:15.687]  Turns into tens of millions of videos.
[02:44:16.288 --> 02:44:17.469]  And that's what we've done.
[02:44:18.529 --> 02:44:20.230]  Because you have taken action.
[02:44:20.591 --> 02:44:28.856]  We plant the little mustard seed of making the film, you run with it, and together it can move mountains.
[02:44:30.001 --> 02:44:43.907]  But at the same time, your purchase of Terror Storm, of Martial Law, of the other books and videos we carry supports us, supports the people that made the films and books that we carry on the online video and bookstore at InfoWars.com.
[02:44:44.287 --> 02:44:45.347]  And it is so important.
[02:44:45.828 --> 02:44:53.631]  If you are well-to-do, middle-class, nouveau riche, wealthy, whatever, and you want to support us, we do not ask for donations.
[02:44:54.702 --> 02:44:57.887]  We ask for you to buy a whole bunch of the videos or books.
[02:44:58.347 --> 02:45:01.552]  Get the Alex Jones Everything Special or the Everything Else Special.
[02:45:01.852 --> 02:45:03.294]  All the other books and videos we carry here.
[02:45:03.594 --> 02:45:05.837]  Call up and say, I want 10 copies of Terror Storm.
[02:45:05.897 --> 02:45:07.900]  I want 100 copies of Terror Storm.
[02:45:08.201 --> 02:45:09.643]  We'll give you huge discounts.
[02:45:10.203 --> 02:45:12.404]  You can call this number if you want to be a distributor.
[02:45:12.504 --> 02:45:13.364]  Buy them in bulk.
[02:45:13.724 --> 02:45:14.784]  Sell them at your bookstore.
[02:45:14.844 --> 02:45:15.784]  Sell them at your store.
[02:45:16.084 --> 02:45:17.245]  Sell them at your truck stop.
[02:45:18.085 --> 02:45:19.145]  Sell them at your church.
[02:45:19.685 --> 02:45:23.106]  Get them out any way you can or make copies and give them away.
[02:45:23.546 --> 02:45:26.547]  I don't care as long as it gets out.
[02:45:27.127 --> 02:45:30.467]  Frankly I've gotten to the point though I need to hire more people for customer service and shipping.
[02:45:31.088 --> 02:45:32.948]  Because it comes in fits and spurts and then
[02:45:33.689 --> 02:45:41.522]  We'll be selling so little that one person can do the shipping and have time to kill and then it comes in spurts and we need like two people or three people and we don't have it.
[02:45:41.542 --> 02:45:44.046]  So we do need your support folks.
[02:45:44.106 --> 02:45:47.952]  So go to Infowars.com and be sure to
[02:45:49.056 --> 02:45:52.618]  Order as many of the books and videos as you can afford and get them out to everybody.
[02:45:52.638 --> 02:45:55.259]  Or call toll free to order 1-888-253-3139.
[02:45:55.279 --> 02:45:56.040]  That's 888-253-3139.
[02:45:56.060 --> 02:45:58.741]  Or you can simply write to me.
[02:45:58.761 --> 02:46:01.462]  I'm Alex Jones at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas 78704.
[02:46:17.975 --> 02:46:30.627]  And you can call my office number at 512-291-5750 if you want to be a bulk distributor or someone who wants to buy a whole bunch of them and carry them or get them out to people.
[02:46:31.888 --> 02:46:33.070]  Distributor isn't the right word.
[02:46:33.090 --> 02:46:35.432]  If you want to be somebody who wants to get a bunch of copies of it, basically.
[02:46:35.772 --> 02:46:37.514]  Or sell them in your store or small bookstore.
[02:46:38.209 --> 02:46:40.130]  Now is the time.
[02:46:40.150 --> 02:46:41.551]  1-888-253-3139.
[02:46:43.631 --> 02:46:45.192]  And we get hundreds of calls every day.
[02:46:45.212 --> 02:46:47.173]  That's why the phone system jams up.
[02:46:47.193 --> 02:46:48.193]  They're taking my kids.
[02:46:48.213 --> 02:46:49.434]  They're forcing vaccines on me.
[02:46:49.454 --> 02:46:50.394]  They're taking my ranch.
[02:46:50.895 --> 02:46:51.915]  They're taking my farm.
[02:46:51.995 --> 02:46:52.475]  Oh, help me!
[02:46:52.535 --> 02:46:52.856]  Help me!
[02:46:53.176 --> 02:46:55.137]  To where I don't even have time to return those calls.
[02:46:55.217 --> 02:46:58.378]  Much less, we're battling to return customer service calls.
[02:46:58.938 --> 02:47:00.519]  I'll walk out of the studio and do,
[02:47:01.232 --> 02:47:03.214]  Three radio interviews after this.
[02:47:03.814 --> 02:47:06.677]  I'll be doing radio interviews, you know, tonight at my house.
[02:47:07.317 --> 02:47:08.198]  I'll be calling news.
[02:47:08.238 --> 02:47:09.399]  And I'm not whining here.
[02:47:09.539 --> 02:47:12.721]  I just... People get insulted when I don't email you back.
[02:47:13.182 --> 02:47:15.243]  You get insulted when I don't call you back.
[02:47:16.064 --> 02:47:20.588]  You get insulted when I won't go to lunch with you or when I won't stop in the parking lot and talk to you.
[02:47:21.068 --> 02:47:23.090]  I barely have time to even see my family.
[02:47:23.690 --> 02:47:28.034]  And that's painful because I love my family and I dearly enjoy spending time with them.
[02:47:29.202 --> 02:47:29.942]  I like fishing.
[02:47:29.962 --> 02:47:30.783]  I like hunting.
[02:47:30.863 --> 02:47:32.403]  I like walking through the woods.
[02:47:32.443 --> 02:47:33.103]  That's what I do.
[02:47:33.143 --> 02:47:37.204]  I'd work eight hours a day and then lollygag the rest of the time.
[02:47:37.665 --> 02:47:39.525]  But I am committed in this fight.
[02:47:39.545 --> 02:47:41.886]  This is a life and death struggle for me.
[02:47:41.906 --> 02:47:48.348]  I hope you realize it's a life and death struggle for you and your destiny is in the crosshairs here.
[02:47:48.408 --> 02:47:49.308]  We're all in this together.
[02:47:50.137 --> 02:48:15.386]  You can also go to PrisonPlanet.TV, get a 15 cent a day membership, get all 15 of my films online, my book, Paul Watson's book, my weekly TV reports, content you're not going to find anywhere else, PrisonPlanet.TV, and your $5.95 monthly subscription pays for the bandwidth and the webmasters that do that, and we're about to revamp and upgrade all the sites and increase their bandwidth, so it's all getting better all the time, basically, in the fight as you support us.
[02:48:17.350 --> 02:48:25.018]  Oh man, I haven't even covered how we're in the LA Times today and the Village Voice and both of them are pretty positive articles.
[02:48:26.800 --> 02:48:28.482]  I mean, it gets the word out.
[02:48:30.123 --> 02:48:33.467]  But I'll try to briefly mention those on the other side and maybe jam a few calls in.
[02:48:34.107 --> 02:48:36.250]  And we've got the big event coming up in Dallas on the 26th.
[02:48:37.231 --> 02:48:38.432]  Jim Mars is going to be there.
[02:48:38.472 --> 02:48:39.233]  Get your tickets now.
[02:48:44.105 --> 02:48:44.585]  It's here!
[02:48:44.805 --> 02:48:49.588]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:48:49.948 --> 02:48:57.612]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:48:58.292 --> 02:49:05.315]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:49:05.736 --> 02:49:12.579]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying,
[02:49:13.109 --> 02:49:17.192]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:49:17.452 --> 02:49:20.974]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:49:21.434 --> 02:49:23.335]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:49:23.676 --> 02:49:27.578]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.
[02:49:28.119 --> 02:49:35.583]  Get your copy today at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling toll-free 1-888-253-3139 or watch it right now online at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:49:41.164 --> 02:49:44.306]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[02:49:44.366 --> 02:49:48.408]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[02:49:48.548 --> 02:49:51.109]  But, if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[02:49:51.169 --> 02:49:53.490]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[02:49:53.690 --> 02:50:02.115]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[02:50:02.195 --> 02:50:03.475]  The Brookie Light is different.
[02:50:03.655 --> 02:50:06.817]  Water molecules take minutes to pass through the torturous pack
[02:50:06.837 --> 02:50:07.358]  We're good to go!
[02:50:27.481 --> 02:50:33.402]  Get the Advanced Berkey Light Purifier for only $279 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[02:50:38.604 --> 02:50:39.744]  Not yet available in Iowa.

[02:51:55.547 --> 02:51:56.088]  Welcome back.
[02:51:56.248 --> 02:51:57.809]  You know, I can't go to any more of your calls.
[02:51:57.869 --> 02:51:58.850]  I'm just flat out of time.
[02:51:58.870 --> 02:52:02.192]  We'll be back tomorrow at 11 to 2 Central and be able to do it.
[02:52:02.232 --> 02:52:03.533]  We always appreciate you calling in.
[02:52:03.573 --> 02:52:06.556]  I'm sorry we're just flat out of time because I wanted to get into this.
[02:52:07.997 --> 02:52:10.519]  Bloggers wondered what happened to Mr. Conspiracy.
[02:52:11.380 --> 02:52:18.964]  Some internet sites say Oliver Stone's WTC fails to address what really happened on 9-11 by Tina Daunt.
[02:52:19.884 --> 02:52:26.487]  The LA Times, in the sub-headline, Memo to Oliver Stone, Conspiracy theorists have a bone to pick with you!
[02:52:28.588 --> 02:52:31.990]  And Jack Blood is in here, GCN Radio host.
[02:52:32.590 --> 02:52:36.572]  Oliver Stone, having done Nixon and JFK and other movies that have been quite revealing,
[02:52:37.364 --> 02:52:45.550]  Had a chance to use his power to ask a few very damning questions, said radio host Jack Blood, who is using and urging a boycott of the film.
[02:52:45.590 --> 02:52:53.515]  Instead, what we have is an establishment movie that certainly condones and endorses the cover story that was given to us by the government on 9-11.
[02:52:54.255 --> 02:52:54.836]  You gotta love it.
[02:52:54.856 --> 02:52:56.237]  They call him radio talk show host.
[02:52:56.477 --> 02:52:58.578]  I'm just an internet radio talk show host.
[02:52:59.479 --> 02:53:00.320]  I've been demoted.
[02:53:00.340 --> 02:53:03.882]  Not on any AM or FM stations, according to them.
[02:53:04.562 --> 02:53:05.923]  Of course, which I am.
[02:53:05.963 --> 02:53:06.543]  That's just funny.
[02:53:07.103 --> 02:53:08.644]  I've asked him to correct that, by the way.
[02:53:09.064 --> 02:53:10.505]  Stone has a simple answer.
[02:53:10.525 --> 02:53:17.948]  He wanted to tell a story of two Port Authority officers who tried to save lives that day, but ended up fighting for their own.
[02:53:18.568 --> 02:53:19.848]  Politics wasn't involved.
[02:53:21.389 --> 02:53:30.173]  Alex Jones, who has an internet radio show on Infowars.com, said he doesn't fault Stone for making a movie that honors the heroes of 9-11.
[02:53:30.673 --> 02:53:33.014]  He is allowed to make a movie about this microcosm
[02:53:33.715 --> 02:53:36.417]  That was such a big part of 9-11, said Jones.
[02:53:36.737 --> 02:53:46.484]  We know that the police and firefighters were heroes, and I agree with that, but there is concern in the 9-11 truth community that the movie will be used to bolster the official story.
[02:53:47.725 --> 02:53:51.368]  To be sure, there are plenty of alternative views on the events of 9-11.
[02:53:53.112 --> 02:53:57.616]  And it goes on to say, some believe the CIA was in on the attacks and the plot.
[02:53:58.036 --> 02:54:00.678]  Others wonder if bombs have been planted inside the towers.
[02:54:01.038 --> 02:54:03.480]  Well, yeah, we're saying the government did it and they put bombs.
[02:54:03.781 --> 02:54:05.242]  It isn't two separate debates.
[02:54:05.902 --> 02:54:07.003]  Still others think the U.S.
[02:54:07.023 --> 02:54:09.865]  government knew the attacks were coming, but chose not to act.
[02:54:10.466 --> 02:54:15.510]  In March, actor Charlie Sheen said in an interview with Jones that he too questions the official 9-11 story.
[02:54:15.930 --> 02:54:20.374]  So that finally made the LA Times, and they go through a bunch of big quotes of Sheen here, so...
[02:54:21.484 --> 02:54:25.005]  That's good that that's been picked back up by the press.
[02:54:25.405 --> 02:54:31.026]  I said, at some point, you will see a Hollywood film that looks at alternative views of the official 9-11 story.
[02:54:31.647 --> 02:54:38.068]  They got John Connor, who does some good work in here, criticizing Stone, saying, is he an Illuminati pawn?
[02:54:39.248 --> 02:54:39.569]  I don't know.
[02:54:39.629 --> 02:54:42.929]  I just know JFK, the director's cut, is the best movie I've ever seen.
[02:54:43.810 --> 02:54:44.750]  Nixon's excellent.
[02:54:44.790 --> 02:54:46.030]  They're both very accurate.
[02:54:47.070 --> 02:54:49.411]  And so, I mean, what do you say?
[02:54:51.460 --> 02:54:59.767]  In the words of a Hollywood producer I had dinner with, Oliver Stone told him that he's hungry for a hit and is just trying to have another hit.
[02:55:01.548 --> 02:55:03.110]  So we'll see what happens.
[02:55:03.130 --> 02:55:07.734]  I don't have time to get into a great article out of the Village Voice.
[02:55:07.774 --> 02:55:11.056]  I mean, it's got a hit piece spin to it, but it's still pretty good.
[02:55:11.076 --> 02:55:20.144]  They favorably talk about my new film, Terror Storm, and they then, well,
[02:55:20.985 --> 02:55:26.828]  Basically, skewer some other people for putting out this information.
[02:55:29.090 --> 02:55:43.417]  But overall, it just talks about how there are all these huge alternative media, grassroots documentary films that are changing the political landscape in the United States and the world.
[02:55:43.437 --> 02:55:49.601]  So they're now directly acknowledging that the worm has turned.
[02:55:50.316 --> 02:55:52.198]  All right, again, I apologize for not getting to your calls.
[02:55:52.238 --> 02:55:54.840]  I'll be back tonight, 9 to midnight, on your affiliates.
[02:55:55.720 --> 02:55:59.263]  And you can listen on the internet 24 hours a day at InfoWars.com.
[02:55:59.303 --> 02:56:04.167]  It just reloops there on the stream that we offer for you, free of charge.
[02:56:05.288 --> 02:56:12.634]  And don't forget, I've got a big 9-11 event with Jim Mars and others, and my new film premiering in Dallas the 26th of August.
[02:56:13.134 --> 02:56:15.636]  Find details at InfoWars.com and get your tickets.
[02:56:16.077 --> 02:56:17.638]  All right, get out there and take on the New World Order.
[02:56:17.678 --> 02:56:18.619]  God bless you all.
