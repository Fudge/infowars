[00:00:05.876 --> 00:00:06.538]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.199 --> 00:00:08.241]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.963 --> 00:00:10.065]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.747 --> 00:00:11.488]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.288 --> 00:00:13.169]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.493]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.033 --> 00:00:22.097]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:39.625 --> 00:00:48.168]  There is a report today on the Sydney Morning Herald stating that the dollar is beginning its full system meltdown.
[00:00:48.208 --> 00:00:51.909]  We'll be getting into this report for you today.
[00:00:52.509 --> 00:00:53.569]  Very, very serious.
[00:00:54.509 --> 00:00:58.751]  London Independent is reporting that Baghdad is under siege and is collapsing.
[00:00:58.771 --> 00:01:03.552]  The, quote, insurgents have taken over almost all the towns and cities ringing it.
[00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:04.840]  U.S.
[00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.482]  forces are being advised to evacuate.
[00:01:07.502 --> 00:01:09.463]  It's like the fall of Saigon.
[00:01:10.423 --> 00:01:12.624]  I guess Bush overcooked the turkey.
[00:01:12.644 --> 00:01:17.947]  He was busy watching Brett Hume on Fox News while he burnt the turkey.
[00:01:18.607 --> 00:01:19.788]  They meant to cook Iraq.
[00:01:19.828 --> 00:01:21.289]  They meant to break it up into pieces.
[00:01:21.329 --> 00:01:25.231]  They meant to form its civil war, but I think they overcooked the turkey.
[00:01:25.991 --> 00:01:28.092]  So we'll be going through that report.
[00:01:28.112 --> 00:01:30.013]  Depleted uranium risk ignored.
[00:01:30.033 --> 00:01:31.774]  BBC is reporting.
[00:01:32.595 --> 00:01:34.516]  A great article by Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:01:34.896 --> 00:01:37.318]  Pentagon will catapult the propaganda via U.S.
[00:01:37.378 --> 00:01:41.780]  media openly announces they're engaging in domestic propaganda ops.
[00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.522]  We will also get into a report out of the Times of London.
[00:01:46.102 --> 00:01:48.303]  The rising threat of the new media.
[00:01:49.204 --> 00:01:53.666]  This is similar to a CNN story a few months ago where they just said the alternative media is taking over.
[00:01:54.246 --> 00:01:57.048]  The mainstream media is collapsing.
[00:01:57.088 --> 00:01:58.048]  Let me use that word again.
[00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:59.069]  Collapsing.
[00:02:00.307 --> 00:02:07.191]  For those of you that have waited all these years to see the enemy defeated, the beginning is starting to unfold here.
[00:02:08.511 --> 00:02:11.433]  It won't happen overnight, but we are fully discrediting the enemy.
[00:02:12.273 --> 00:02:13.734]  We are fully exposing them.
[00:02:13.834 --> 00:02:16.836]  We are fully dismantling their propaganda systems.
[00:02:17.476 --> 00:02:22.859]  The people are beginning to win, and the COINTELPRO operatives and others are literally screaming and pulling their hair out.
[00:02:23.419 --> 00:02:27.201]  I have to admit, it's very satisfying.
[00:02:27.859 --> 00:02:29.340]  That doesn't mean we're out of the woods, though.
[00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:31.280]  Things are going to get worse before they get a lot better.
[00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:40.223]  Also, Kerry and Clinton, Hillary, they're running around in these staged fights with the White House, trying to get people back into the left-right paradigm.
[00:02:40.283 --> 00:02:41.163]  It's not working.
[00:02:42.444 --> 00:02:44.824]  So they're staging these WWF events.
[00:02:46.725 --> 00:02:49.746]  This is just some of what is coming up.
[00:02:50.817 --> 00:02:52.058]  In the next three hours.
[00:02:52.318 --> 00:02:53.378]  I don't have any guests today.
[00:02:53.398 --> 00:03:00.422]  I have actually canceled some guests because I want to be able to take your calls and give you a chance to respond.
[00:03:00.983 --> 00:03:05.385]  We are now just five days away from the election.
[00:03:07.326 --> 00:03:09.227]  Well, I guess technically six days away.
[00:03:09.647 --> 00:03:10.808]  It is, of course, November 1st, 2006.
[00:03:16.355 --> 00:03:19.998]  And in just a few days, we will see another election stolen.
[00:03:20.278 --> 00:03:21.620]  All the indicators show this.
[00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:40.535]  In fact, every major scientific poll, every major regional poll, shows massive losses by the neocon, gun-grabbing, open-border-promoting, phony conservatives to be replaced by the openly wicked and openly anti-American Democrats.
[00:03:40.615 --> 00:03:41.236]  And frankly...
[00:03:42.353 --> 00:03:44.394]  I like an enemy that's out in the open.
[00:03:44.474 --> 00:03:46.174]  I like when the cloaking device is off.
[00:03:46.334 --> 00:03:50.836]  I like it when they're out in the open and we can fight them that much easier.
[00:03:50.856 --> 00:03:53.216]  Plus it'll be a greater separation of powers.
[00:03:53.236 --> 00:03:56.618]  You won't have the executive totally ruling all three branches of government.
[00:03:58.418 --> 00:04:00.259]  At least on the surface you won't.
[00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:02.399]  So I'll get into that.
[00:04:02.439 --> 00:04:04.560]  But Bush is saying the speech is no problem.
[00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:05.640]  We're not going to lose anything.
[00:04:06.281 --> 00:04:07.241]  We're going to keep the House.
[00:04:07.281 --> 00:04:08.281]  We're going to keep the Senate.
[00:04:08.861 --> 00:04:09.542]  No prob.
[00:04:10.182 --> 00:04:10.322]  And...
[00:04:11.917 --> 00:04:13.678]  The mainstream media is trying to spin this.
[00:04:13.818 --> 00:04:20.203]  Well, the Democrats it shows are going to win, but the Republicans are closing the gap.
[00:04:20.303 --> 00:04:23.145]  It's going to be close, contrary to what polls say.
[00:04:24.546 --> 00:04:38.136]  When in truth, if you talk to people on the ground, you get on Rip Talk Radio, you talk to the people in this country, there is abject hatred of the Bush administration by conservatives, liberals, libertarians, progressives, whatever you want to call them.
[00:04:39.357 --> 00:04:40.278]  Different groups everywhere.
[00:04:40.982 --> 00:04:44.044]  And so the media's trying to go, well, it's going to be closer than you think.
[00:04:44.064 --> 00:04:47.405]  And Karl Rove's laughing, going, absolutely no prob.
[00:04:47.825 --> 00:04:48.986]  We're not going to lose anything.
[00:04:50.627 --> 00:04:56.650]  So it'll be kind of like Mexico, where everybody voted against the neocon candidate, and he still wins.
[00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:58.951]  We'll make them steal it from everybody if they are.
[00:04:58.971 --> 00:04:59.831]  We'll be right back.
[00:05:04.483 --> 00:05:07.684]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[00:05:08.004 --> 00:05:09.925]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[00:05:10.325 --> 00:05:17.987]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:05:18.647 --> 00:05:25.710]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:29.051]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran.
[00:05:29.431 --> 00:05:31.752]  A White House program to disseminate fake news.
[00:05:32.172 --> 00:05:33.012]  NSA spies.
[00:05:33.564 --> 00:05:36.826]  Or by calling toll-free 1-888-253-3139 or watch it right now online at prisonplanet.tv
[00:06:02.785 --> 00:06:03.826]  The war on terrorism.
[00:06:04.147 --> 00:06:06.930]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:11.355]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[00:06:11.795 --> 00:06:12.636]  So what do you do?
[00:06:12.937 --> 00:06:17.502]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[00:06:17.984 --> 00:06:20.105]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[00:06:20.605 --> 00:06:35.292]  Sheltering in Place, surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:06:35.352 --> 00:06:42.456]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[00:06:42.756 --> 00:06:45.917]  Get this critical video every American needs for only $29 plus shipping.
[00:06:47.318 --> 00:06:48.860]  Or order on the web at BerkeyWater.com.
[00:07:02.239 --> 00:07:04.802]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here with an important question.
[00:07:04.963 --> 00:07:07.125]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[00:07:07.406 --> 00:07:17.499]  I mean the hard to find kind that's all natural and not full of corrosive toxins and chemicals and detergents that just dry out your skin and have been connected to very serious health problems?
[00:07:17.819 --> 00:07:20.142]  Let me tell you something about the Cal Bend Pure Soap Company.

[00:07:50.663 --> 00:07:52.424]  That's 1-800-340-7091 or on the web at CalvinPureSoap.com.
[00:08:02.393 --> 00:08:08.017]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:22.687 --> 00:08:28.711]  Okay, we're only six days away from the election in 2006, the off-year election.
[00:08:30.570 --> 00:08:43.476]  Every indicator, every piece of information we show, that we have, demonstrates a massive landslide, predominantly against Republicans, but also against incumbents.
[00:08:43.697 --> 00:08:51.981]  Incumbents everywhere, at a level not seen since 1994, with the Republican revolution that was hijacked by Newt Gingrich.
[00:08:52.021 --> 00:08:53.441]  That was a good revolution.
[00:08:53.842 --> 00:08:56.643]  It was genuine, but it was completely hijacked by Newt Gingrich.
[00:08:57.446 --> 00:09:05.629]  We have not seen a revolution moving towards the Congress, a revolution of change, since 12 years ago.
[00:09:06.670 --> 00:09:07.310]  Since 1994.
[00:09:09.711 --> 00:09:19.715]  And, again, every poll, every piece of data that we have shows a huge move towards not just Republicans losing the House and probably the Senate.
[00:09:20.155 --> 00:09:21.556]  They should lose the Senate as well.
[00:09:21.576 --> 00:09:22.536]  That's what the data shows.
[00:09:23.076 --> 00:09:24.857]  But also a lot of incumbent...
[00:09:25.615 --> 00:09:35.243]  Democrats being removed and being replaced with other candidates, though they're Republicans, who at least claim that they're anti-war.
[00:09:36.685 --> 00:09:45.772]  So there is a lot of interesting things happening right now, and I see the Democrats gaining control unless there's election fraud.
[00:09:45.812 --> 00:09:47.394]  Well, there's going to be election fraud.
[00:09:47.874 --> 00:09:49.836]  I mean, they stole it in 2000, they stole it in 2002, they stole it in 2004.
[00:09:53.021 --> 00:09:55.202]  And they're going to try to steal it again in 2006.
[00:09:56.462 --> 00:10:11.308]  35% of the country, roughly, because that number seems to be changing daily, have put in the electronic voting machines, the type where there's no paper ballot, no record, no information, no way to prove that there was fraud.
[00:10:12.768 --> 00:10:16.910]  I had a question last night when I was at Waterloo Records and Video.
[00:10:17.597 --> 00:10:18.318]  We're good to go.
[00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:56.416]  We also had a little globalist in there who called me a liar and then staggered out the door, scurried out the door, tried to basically ran out.
[00:10:56.436 --> 00:10:59.578]  He just yelled his little comment and then scurried away.
[00:10:59.618 --> 00:11:00.779]  I wish he'd call into the show.
[00:11:01.319 --> 00:11:02.080]  He called me a liar.
[00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:03.020]  He said I'm full of bull.
[00:11:04.521 --> 00:11:05.602]  But to make a long story short...
[00:11:06.785 --> 00:11:08.347]  I've got several questions.
[00:11:08.367 --> 00:11:09.628]  Well, should we vote?
[00:11:09.908 --> 00:11:14.172]  Or, well, if electronic voting machines are so bad, you know, they can steal paper ballots.
[00:11:14.252 --> 00:11:20.797]  Look at what happened in South Texas with LBJ and his congressional run that was stolen.
[00:11:22.378 --> 00:11:23.099]  And I agree.
[00:11:23.519 --> 00:11:29.084]  I mean, the paper ballots can be stolen, but it takes millions of people to do it in a federal election.
[00:11:29.634 --> 00:11:31.154]  To really steal it nationwide.
[00:11:31.194 --> 00:11:36.656]  It takes incredible coordination, and it's much easier to catch people doing it, and they do get caught doing it.
[00:11:38.416 --> 00:11:52.199]  And so, again, we need to go back to verifiable paper ballots, not secret machines with wireless hookups designed with the engineers going public, saying they were hired to, quote, rig the machines so they could be electronically accessed and hacked.
[00:11:52.580 --> 00:11:58.341]  I mean, a bunch of engineers have gone public, a bunch of the other employees, these companies are felons for computer crimes.
[00:11:59.131 --> 00:12:03.395]  It's just like Admiral Poindexter, five-time felon, running Total Information Awareness.
[00:12:04.056 --> 00:12:10.822]  It's like I'm hiring known cocaine dealers to run the different vote tabulation systems in Florida.
[00:12:11.243 --> 00:12:17.629]  There have been mainstream news articles years after we pointed it out saying the Bush administration hires criminals.
[00:12:17.669 --> 00:12:18.770]  I mean, they know where to go.
[00:12:19.350 --> 00:12:24.075]  They go hire mobsters and criminals and hackers, and that's who works for them.
[00:12:25.879 --> 00:12:29.201]  So they're definitely going to try to steal the election.
[00:12:29.441 --> 00:12:42.287]  And even if they're unable, because there's such a landslide in so many areas where they don't have control, even if they do lose control of the House, probably not the Senate, they would lose the House and Senate.
[00:12:42.307 --> 00:12:43.187]  All the numbers show that.
[00:12:43.548 --> 00:12:47.269]  But I believe they are going to steal the election in many districts around the country.
[00:12:47.930 --> 00:12:52.232]  And so you're going to probably have the House lost, but the Senate will stay in their hands.
[00:12:53.397 --> 00:13:06.571]  But, and of course, if Nancy Pelosi, if the Democrats do take the House, Nancy Pelosi's already sworn to protect George Bush and not allow impeachment hearings, not allow any of the real evidence of the Iraq lies or 9-11 or the...
[00:13:08.752 --> 00:13:11.693]  The bid rigging, none of that is going to come out.
[00:13:11.793 --> 00:13:24.819]  The Democrats are going to protect their flank, because it's really one organism, one creature in D.C., a bunch of political prostitutes, bought and paid for by international lobbyists, who themselves are bought and paid for by the big central banks.
[00:13:25.639 --> 00:13:29.621]  Our intelligence agencies have been infiltrated by the Israelis, by the British, by the Russians.
[00:13:30.542 --> 00:13:32.863]  We're an absolute laughing stock by the Chinese.
[00:13:33.243 --> 00:13:35.924]  The Chinese have over 5,000 front companies in this nation.
[00:13:36.793 --> 00:13:41.857]  The country's full of 30 million illegal aliens from Latin America screaming for U.S.
[00:13:41.917 --> 00:13:45.060]  blood, all financed by our government, to bring down the U.S.
[00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:46.201]  into the North American Union.
[00:13:46.661 --> 00:13:48.603]  I mean, it's not pretty, what's happening.
[00:13:48.643 --> 00:13:52.987]  But I'd like to get your take on this at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:13:54.688 --> 00:13:55.909]  I've got to confirm this.
[00:13:55.929 --> 00:13:59.692]  I've been so busy last night and this morning, I haven't had a chance to check it on the NRA website.
[00:13:59.712 --> 00:14:01.814]  I meant to do it during the last break, but was doing some other stuff.
[00:14:02.777 --> 00:14:20.582]  But I had two separate people, no, no, no, three separate, excuse me, tell me last night, including somebody that works for me, that they did see the NRA website and the NRA review, and Ron Paul is being given a lower score than the Democrat for the Second Amendment.
[00:14:20.642 --> 00:14:23.342]  Now, Ron Paul has voted for the Second Amendment.
[00:14:24.323 --> 00:14:26.183]  The JBS gives him a 100.
[00:14:27.203 --> 00:14:28.324]  If that's possible, he has a 100.
[00:14:30.458 --> 00:14:31.598]  On constitutional issues.
[00:14:31.638 --> 00:14:32.558]  He's pro-gun 110%.
[00:14:33.079 --> 00:14:37.659]  He is an absolute treasure to Texas.
[00:14:39.340 --> 00:14:42.520]  And I need to go out there during the break and see this for myself.
[00:14:42.540 --> 00:14:50.242]  But again, I was told about this by two people at the signing last night and the speech I gave at the Waterloo Records and Music.
[00:14:51.002 --> 00:14:52.982]  And then I was told this by somebody that works for me.
[00:14:53.002 --> 00:14:54.082]  He goes, oh yeah, I saw that.
[00:14:54.102 --> 00:14:55.923]  Oh yeah, I talked to Ron Paul's office about that.
[00:14:56.303 --> 00:14:58.463]  Little did I know we'd been in contact with his office.
[00:14:59.389 --> 00:15:03.852]  We've been trying to get him on, but he said he's so busy during the election, he'll come on after the election, and he's even still there.
[00:15:04.553 --> 00:15:05.854]  The last election he won by 66%.
[00:15:06.114 --> 00:15:08.316]  The election before that he won by 64%.
[00:15:09.276 --> 00:15:11.078]  The election before that he won by 60%.
[00:15:11.878 --> 00:15:14.160]  So he's been getting more popular.
[00:15:16.302 --> 00:15:19.464]  Well, they've rewritten his district, and when Tom DeLay, the criminal...
[00:15:20.865 --> 00:15:21.787]  Rewrote the districts.
[00:15:21.967 --> 00:15:24.692]  He wrote it against conservative Democrats in the state.
[00:15:25.053 --> 00:15:30.022]  Literally gave districts to the liberals and to the La Reconquistas in South Texas.
[00:15:30.794 --> 00:15:34.937]  That's even been in the local statesmen admitting that they wrote it against conservative Democrats.
[00:15:35.037 --> 00:15:36.459]  We've got a lot of those here in Texas.
[00:15:37.039 --> 00:15:43.284]  And then they also wrote it federally with the congressional seats against Ron Paul.
[00:15:43.324 --> 00:15:45.626]  He has a completely different district than what he had.
[00:15:45.906 --> 00:15:50.309]  In the past, his district ran right up into Austin.
[00:15:50.650 --> 00:15:56.314]  Not into Austin, but right up from the south up to the underbelly of Austin into Bastrop.
[00:15:56.714 --> 00:15:58.035]  It stretched down into Houston.
[00:15:58.095 --> 00:15:59.877]  Now he's got a coastal district
[00:16:00.277 --> 00:16:01.918]  People that don't know him from Adam.
[00:16:03.799 --> 00:16:16.706]  The polls were showing he was going to win by 64%, but suddenly the neocons are all announcing, they're backing the big Democrat who's a lobbyist for Big Agra, who's a big proponent of Animal ID.
[00:16:17.066 --> 00:16:25.070]  He's sworn to ensure that that stays in place in Texas, which again is the front line for Animal ID, New Freedom Initiative for Psychological Testing.
[00:16:26.010 --> 00:16:26.971]  We're good to go.
[00:16:52.648 --> 00:16:53.369]  We're good to go.
[00:16:53.409 --> 00:16:53.609]  I think?
[00:17:19.252 --> 00:17:22.353]  For his traitorous activities with the North American Union and the war.
[00:17:22.873 --> 00:17:24.493]  He said, yes, he should be impeached.
[00:17:25.534 --> 00:17:30.555]  But he went on to say, so should the Democrats and Republicans and everybody that went along with this unconstitutional stuff.
[00:17:30.595 --> 00:17:32.055]  Well, that was in a Houston paper.
[00:17:33.276 --> 00:17:44.118]  The horrible 27-year-old lobbyist from a 100-millionaire family, big microchipper, horrible little sniveling creature.
[00:17:45.038 --> 00:17:46.759]  He takes that audio clip of this show
[00:17:47.890 --> 00:17:54.256]  He travels all over Texas, and he plays it out of context and goes, Look at this liberal Ron Paul!
[00:17:54.656 --> 00:17:55.437]  This is a Democrat.
[00:17:56.738 --> 00:17:57.859]  You need to vote him out.
[00:17:58.159 --> 00:17:59.741]  But that's not really hurting Paul.
[00:18:00.161 --> 00:18:01.122]  It's the redistricting.
[00:18:01.502 --> 00:18:02.143]  It's other things.
[00:18:02.183 --> 00:18:04.005]  But the polls are showing he's still going to win.
[00:18:04.525 --> 00:18:05.646]  They polled his new district.
[00:18:05.966 --> 00:18:07.488]  But the neocons are saying, No, no, no.
[00:18:07.648 --> 00:18:09.950]  Our data, our internal data shows he's going to lose.
[00:18:09.990 --> 00:18:13.153]  So they're already doing a squawking victory dance.
[00:18:14.088 --> 00:18:23.017]  We know human events reported as well as roll call that the Bush White House targeted Tom Tancredo last time and claimed he was going to lose because he's another good congressman.
[00:18:23.577 --> 00:18:26.880]  So Ron Paul no doubt will win, but they may feel it from him.
[00:18:28.202 --> 00:18:35.769]  They're running around with a creamy-eyed look in their eyes and already doing victory dances as these people do.
[00:18:38.231 --> 00:18:39.232]  And I'm very upset about it.
[00:18:39.312 --> 00:18:45.555]  By the way, the guy he's running against, I'm not going to even say his name, does not have permission to use clips from this radio show.
[00:18:45.995 --> 00:18:52.299]  So I'm telling you, you better call and you better call Ron Paul's office and say, I'm not going to waste your time.
[00:18:52.799 --> 00:19:03.705]  I want to know how I come to your campaign headquarters in South Texas or your offices across the state and I want to pay for signs or I want to be given signs and you better get out all over his district.
[00:19:03.725 --> 00:19:07.087]  You better call family you've got in his district and you better fight for him.
[00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:13.401]  Because Congressman Ron Paul is in trouble.
[00:19:14.141 --> 00:19:20.903]  And again, he had the honesty to not dodge that question, to say George Bush needs to be impeached.
[00:19:21.763 --> 00:19:28.304]  And it makes me really mad that that sniveling, you know, it's going to ruin Texas farms and Texas ranches.
[00:19:28.364 --> 00:19:31.245]  I mean, this animal ID is the end, folks, of small farms and ranches.
[00:19:31.285 --> 00:19:32.025]  There's no doubting it.
[00:19:33.216 --> 00:19:35.438]  $1,000 a day fines if you don't have every animal chipped.
[00:19:35.458 --> 00:19:38.721]  When your animal dies, you've got to report it within, what was it, four days.
[00:19:39.622 --> 00:19:43.044]  I mean, it's hell on earth, every chicken with a $10 microchip on it.
[00:19:44.125 --> 00:19:46.827]  We'll come back, get into Baghdad's imploding.
[00:19:47.528 --> 00:19:51.731]  It's Bedlam, your calls, massive Wednesday edition.
[00:19:51.751 --> 00:19:52.192]  Stay with us.
[00:20:04.801 --> 00:20:06.741]  Do you know the truth about breast cancer?
[00:20:07.241 --> 00:20:09.682]  Do you realize that the race for the cure is over?
[00:20:10.462 --> 00:20:18.884]  The best-kept secret in the world today is that now it's possible to kill cancer without personal suffering, mutilation, and poisoning of your entire system.
[00:20:19.845 --> 00:20:24.686]  Now it's cancer's turn to die with LaysMed Incorporated's patented methodology.
[00:20:25.362 --> 00:20:35.372]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation, we can destroy skin cancer and breast tumors of any size without adverse side effects at a physician's office.
[00:20:35.852 --> 00:20:38.154]  Star War technology at its best.
[00:20:38.935 --> 00:20:40.176]  For more information, call 702-953-0267.
[00:20:40.196 --> 00:20:40.236]  702-953-0267.
[00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:52.602]  Or visit www.laysmedinc.com.
[00:20:52.922 --> 00:20:58.945]  That's www.l-a-s-e-m-e-d-i-n-c.com.
[00:21:01.986 --> 00:21:03.087]  Ted Anderson from Midas.
[00:21:03.167 --> 00:21:04.287]  Today is November 1st, 2006.
[00:21:04.327 --> 00:21:06.588]  Gold opened at $614.30, and one-ounce gold coins can be purchased for $640.56.
[00:21:06.628 --> 00:21:08.449]  Again, that's $640.56 to purchase one-ounce gold coins.
[00:21:14.767 --> 00:21:27.702]  On June 4th, 1963, an unknown presidential decree, Executive Order 11110, was signed with the authority to strip the Federal Reserve Bank of its power to lend money to the United States government and interest.
[00:21:28.163 --> 00:21:31.387]  With the stroke of a pen, Kennedy would have put the Fed out of business.
[00:21:31.867 --> 00:21:35.330]  The November assassination quieted the production of the new currency.
[00:21:35.390 --> 00:21:38.392]  However, the executive order still stands unrepealed.
[00:21:38.833 --> 00:21:41.675]  Midas has the Kennedy v. Fed document.
[00:21:41.895 --> 00:21:42.676]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:21:45.238 --> 00:21:47.520]  Unlike your liberty, the paper is free.
[00:21:47.860 --> 00:21:50.682]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:21:51.183 --> 00:21:54.766]  If you're interested in breaking the bondage of taxation and debt, call 800-686-2237.
[00:21:54.806 --> 00:21:54.986]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:22:02.370 --> 00:22:04.831]  David J. Smith for News Watch Magazine.
[00:22:05.592 --> 00:22:11.234]  Over the last 40 years, we've seen prayer and God thrown out of the schools by decisions of the U.S.
[00:22:11.254 --> 00:22:12.015]  Supreme Court.
[00:22:12.795 --> 00:22:17.097]  Yet on February 29, 1892, in an eye-nothing decision of the U.S.
[00:22:17.117 --> 00:22:20.739]  Supreme Court, America was declared a Christian nation.
[00:22:21.719 --> 00:22:26.942]  There is an ongoing assault on your First Amendment right of freedom of religion and freedom of assembly.
[00:22:27.688 --> 00:22:28.008]  516-8736 That's 1-800-516-8736
[00:22:51.681 --> 00:22:52.261]  Call now.

[00:24:02.253 --> 00:24:05.016]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[00:24:05.036 --> 00:24:08.859]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:13.211 --> 00:24:16.812]  We're good to go.
[00:24:37.862 --> 00:24:46.789]  As American and British political leaders argue over responsibility for the crisis in Iraq, the country has taken another lurch towards disintegration, which was planned all along.
[00:24:46.829 --> 00:24:48.711]  But again, it's like you plan baking a cake.
[00:24:49.632 --> 00:24:51.633]  You can also burn the cake.
[00:24:53.195 --> 00:24:55.777]  People say with my prediction they plan to break it into three parts.
[00:24:55.837 --> 00:24:56.597]  It wasn't a prediction.
[00:24:56.638 --> 00:24:58.299]  I was reading it directly from their own documents.
[00:24:59.048 --> 00:24:59.268]  All right.
[00:25:29.013 --> 00:25:29.753]  Hi, how you doing?
[00:25:30.554 --> 00:25:33.275]  Give me a big favor and turn your radio off.
[00:25:34.535 --> 00:25:35.595]  Okay, the radio is off.
[00:25:35.856 --> 00:25:36.516]  Great, go ahead.
[00:25:36.896 --> 00:25:37.116]  Yes.
[00:25:37.136 --> 00:25:39.517]  No, it's not better.
[00:25:39.557 --> 00:25:40.277]  You've still got it on.
[00:25:40.297 --> 00:25:43.678]  And I'm going to have to let you go in about five seconds if it isn't off.
[00:25:46.760 --> 00:25:47.720]  Oh, I apologize.
[00:25:47.740 --> 00:25:49.141]  Because you're calling from the Netherlands.
[00:25:49.621 --> 00:25:52.242]  There is a feedback loop over the phone line.
[00:25:53.362 --> 00:25:54.082]  Okay, I apologize.
[00:25:54.102 --> 00:25:54.643]  Go ahead, sir.
[00:25:55.743 --> 00:25:57.244]  Yeah, is it any better now?
[00:25:57.764 --> 00:25:58.364]  Yes, go ahead.
[00:25:59.753 --> 00:26:00.554]  All right.
[00:26:00.574 --> 00:26:01.314]  A couple of things.
[00:26:01.754 --> 00:26:06.438]  One, I've noticed that the truth movement, it's really picking up speed.
[00:26:07.478 --> 00:26:11.721]  Lots of people I'm talking about mention Loose Change and your movie, Terror Storm.
[00:26:12.301 --> 00:26:19.946]  About 80% of the people that I bump into actually have seen either one of those or both movies and really enjoy it.
[00:26:19.967 --> 00:26:21.127]  They're talking to other people.
[00:26:21.227 --> 00:26:22.428]  They're sending movies out.
[00:26:23.029 --> 00:26:23.529]  It's awesome.
[00:26:24.693 --> 00:26:32.336]  Another little thing I'd like to mention is I just went to an aviation seminar, a safety seminar, on a commercial pilot.
[00:26:33.056 --> 00:26:43.760]  And they were talking about November 6th, where in the EU they will introduce basically the same draconian screening that they've got going on in the United States.
[00:26:43.900 --> 00:26:44.960]  That's right.
[00:26:44.980 --> 00:26:49.182]  A month ago they signed the deal to merge the integrated databases
[00:26:49.921 --> 00:26:57.044]  The Trusted Flyer program, the Total Information Awareness Network system is being merged globally right now.
[00:26:58.524 --> 00:26:58.824]  Right.
[00:27:00.065 --> 00:27:02.086]  Now, in the summary, you're allowed to ask questions.
[00:27:02.106 --> 00:27:06.687]  So I'm asking this guy the question, why are you suddenly now into this liquid?
[00:27:06.907 --> 00:27:08.568]  Don't you remember the Bajinka plot?
[00:27:08.748 --> 00:27:10.789]  You know, I mentioned that thing as eyes opened up.
[00:27:11.834 --> 00:27:15.398]  Ramsey Youssef mentioned that, and he said, oh, we've got someone that pays attention.
[00:27:15.899 --> 00:27:31.034]  And then he said, well, I'm not really supposed to talk about it, but the difference is, back then, they were going to use nitroglycerin, and in the new uncovered plot, the liquids would be far more difficult to detect.
[00:27:31.963 --> 00:27:35.284]  I said, okay, that means we have... Well, you know what?
[00:27:35.485 --> 00:27:38.466]  We've had two bomb squad experts on this show.
[00:27:38.546 --> 00:27:41.927]  One of them ran the big British Army bomb squad in Northern Ireland.
[00:27:42.507 --> 00:27:50.651]  Bottom line, it takes hours in a bathroom, if they were lucky, to mix those properly and then have it dry to make a bomb.
[00:27:50.731 --> 00:27:57.014]  It is next to impossible for anyone to go on a plane with liquids to make a bomb.
[00:27:57.054 --> 00:27:57.954]  It's total baloney.
[00:27:58.917 --> 00:27:59.297]  I know.
[00:27:59.357 --> 00:28:00.278]  You don't have to tell me.
[00:28:00.378 --> 00:28:01.118]  I know that.
[00:28:01.258 --> 00:28:08.260]  It's just that, you know, it's basically now they've got the system boiled to the same level they have it in the United States.
[00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:09.281]  It's ridiculous.
[00:28:09.721 --> 00:28:12.382]  Well, sir, I mean, take our national ID card.
[00:28:13.902 --> 00:28:15.483]  Sure, take our national ID card.
[00:28:16.503 --> 00:28:16.883]  Oh, yeah.
[00:28:17.163 --> 00:28:20.824]  I mean, that is globally standardized.
[00:28:21.805 --> 00:28:23.125]  Just all these programs.
[00:28:23.305 --> 00:28:26.226]  Nature Conservancy land grabs are globally standardized.
[00:28:26.666 --> 00:28:27.947]  Everything is standardized.
[00:28:27.967 --> 00:28:28.267]  I know that.
[00:28:31.550 --> 00:28:33.011]  Yeah, you're absolutely right.
[00:28:33.491 --> 00:28:35.492]  And that's where the whole thing is going.
[00:28:35.892 --> 00:28:40.455]  But my question to you, and that's the last thing I wanted to mention, if I may.
[00:28:40.775 --> 00:28:41.335]  Sure, go ahead.
[00:28:42.536 --> 00:28:44.897]  Okay, what do you see as the next step?
[00:28:46.078 --> 00:28:50.020]  Everyone finds out, the whole world knows, but what's the next step?
[00:28:50.080 --> 00:28:52.001]  How do we go about getting justice?
[00:28:52.341 --> 00:28:53.762]  I would like a few words on that.
[00:28:54.422 --> 00:28:59.245]  Well, we have not educated the entire population yet, and that's the number one key to
[00:29:00.249 --> 00:29:02.350]  And, I mean, there are many, many different solutions.
[00:29:02.370 --> 00:29:04.331]  There are a hundred different fronts we're fighting on.
[00:29:04.832 --> 00:29:08.354]  Expose the electronic voting machines as a fraud, remove them, go back to paper ballots.
[00:29:08.694 --> 00:29:11.496]  Shut down the borders, start deporting illegal aliens.
[00:29:11.776 --> 00:29:14.217]  Cut off illegal aliens' welfare.
[00:29:15.398 --> 00:29:16.859]  Punish criminals in government.
[00:29:16.959 --> 00:29:18.260]  I mean, there's so many things we need to do.
[00:29:19.520 --> 00:29:22.502]  Right, but how do you go about actually punishing the guys in government?
[00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:26.363]  Well, you see, it's a big world and big systems.
[00:29:26.743 --> 00:29:28.204]  None of it's going to happen overnight.
[00:29:28.224 --> 00:29:29.745]  They didn't build their system overnight.
[00:29:30.146 --> 00:29:31.186]  We're not going to dismantle it.
[00:29:31.206 --> 00:29:34.409]  There's no silver bullet, you know, one little magic thing we can do.
[00:29:34.429 --> 00:29:35.610]  I appreciate your call.
[00:29:36.831 --> 00:29:40.193]  Now, we talk about solutions here every day, but really it's hard work.
[00:29:40.254 --> 00:29:41.094]  It's being informed.
[00:29:41.474 --> 00:29:42.295]  It's taking action.
[00:29:42.335 --> 00:29:42.896]  It's hard work.
[00:29:43.236 --> 00:29:45.157]  Thanks for your call from the Netherlands, Sam.
[00:29:45.558 --> 00:29:49.541]  More calls and tons of news straight ahead here on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:51.972 --> 00:29:52.875]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.377 --> 00:29:54.963]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.906 --> 00:29:58.595]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.563 --> 00:30:04.985]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network.
[00:30:05.485 --> 00:30:08.788]  Let's ask the question that the Bush regime hopes you will never ask.
[00:30:09.188 --> 00:30:12.130]  That is, is the USA already bankrupt?
[00:30:12.411 --> 00:30:18.776]  As the world's biggest debtor nation, we are borrowing in excess of 80% of the world's net savings.
[00:30:18.856 --> 00:30:23.259]  That's $2 billion per day to finance the biggest deficit in history.
[00:30:23.479 --> 00:30:27.842]  Our creditors are becoming increasingly concerned that the debt can never be repaid.
[00:30:28.002 --> 00:30:30.604]  Japan and China, two of the largest holders of U.S.
[00:30:30.644 --> 00:30:33.406]  debt, are looking to greatly reduce their exposure to dollars.
[00:30:33.866 --> 00:30:36.408]  In fact, China has privately hinted that a U.S.
[00:30:36.448 --> 00:30:40.711]  attack on Iran could result in China dumping massive amounts of U.S.
[00:30:40.771 --> 00:30:41.592]  Treasury bonds.
[00:30:41.892 --> 00:30:46.496]  To find out more about this, call for a free report on the coming dollar collapse.
[00:30:46.696 --> 00:30:48.317]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.
[00:30:48.337 --> 00:30:50.539]  That's 1-888-8XANADU or 1-888-8XANADU and ask for George.
[00:31:01.391 --> 00:31:09.638]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[00:31:09.898 --> 00:31:14.241]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[00:31:14.542 --> 00:31:23.469]  The KDF Shower Filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[00:31:23.669 --> 00:31:27.292]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[00:31:27.572 --> 00:31:32.598]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[00:31:32.898 --> 00:31:39.645]  Hospitals, restaurants and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria.
[00:31:40.126 --> 00:31:40.667]  What about you?
[00:31:41.417 --> 00:31:46.760]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.
[00:31:46.820 --> 00:31:47.901]  Call now to order at 1-888-803-4438.
[00:31:47.981 --> 00:31:49.882]  Order today and save $14 by calling 1-888-803-4438.
[00:31:49.902 --> 00:31:54.504]  Hey, want to know a natural healing treatment that's been around for thousands of years?
[00:31:54.624 --> 00:31:54.984]  Salt products.
[00:32:08.442 --> 00:32:11.888]  Now Soleil Wellness brings these natural healing products to your home.
[00:32:12.646 --> 00:32:16.367]  Easy to use, non-toxic, and 100% natural.
[00:32:16.747 --> 00:32:20.429]  These products help to give you great physical, mental, and spiritual results.
[00:32:20.949 --> 00:32:23.270]  Heated cell pillows for earaches and back pain.
[00:32:23.730 --> 00:32:25.730]  Cell pipes to relieve respiratory ailments.
[00:32:26.071 --> 00:32:29.912]  Bath salts release toxins as they soften and rehydrate the skin.
[00:32:30.312 --> 00:32:34.113]  Pretty salt lamps to ionize the air and reduce EMF radiation.
[00:32:34.593 --> 00:32:36.994]  So many different cell products available for you.
[00:32:37.314 --> 00:32:38.815]  It's time to let the secret out.
[00:32:39.155 --> 00:32:39.375]  Or call 312-224-2710.
[00:32:39.395 --> 00:32:39.575]  That's 312-224-2710.
[00:32:39.595 --> 00:32:40.616]  Mention GCN Live for a free gift.
[00:33:20.349 --> 00:33:30.716]  There must be some kind of way out of here Say the joker to the thief There's too much confusion
[00:33:33.318 --> 00:33:47.481]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen, on this live Wednesday edition, the first day of November 2006.
[00:34:00.487 --> 00:34:05.369]  And just six days from now, we will have the 2006 off-year election.
[00:34:05.589 --> 00:34:09.471]  Federal observers and monitors are heading to the polls.
[00:34:09.511 --> 00:34:10.612]  That's CNN reporting.
[00:34:11.152 --> 00:34:13.133]  And you can fill in the blank there, read between the lines.
[00:34:13.173 --> 00:34:24.398]  That means federal mafia technicians to ensure the fraud goes smoothly, being dispatched to 800 key cities and areas to run the operations.
[00:34:25.818 --> 00:34:27.339]  Baghdad is under siege.
[00:34:28.368 --> 00:34:43.242]  The Times of London is bemoaning the rising threat of the new media, reporting that their readerships are declining quicker than a decimation or a 10% reduction each year.
[00:34:43.742 --> 00:34:46.685]  The downward spiral is now accelerating.
[00:34:47.366 --> 00:34:49.448]  I am going to have open phones throughout the broadcast.
[00:34:49.508 --> 00:34:51.710]  In fact, let's go to your calls right now.
[00:34:51.890 --> 00:34:53.812]  Robert in Colorado, thanks for holding.
[00:34:53.852 --> 00:34:54.172]  Welcome.
[00:34:55.248 --> 00:34:57.049]  Good morning, Alexander Emrick Jones.
[00:34:57.069 --> 00:34:58.050]  Thanks for taking my call.
[00:34:58.911 --> 00:35:00.251]  Three questions, if I may.
[00:35:00.852 --> 00:35:04.514]  Number one, were you on BET radio yesterday?
[00:35:04.534 --> 00:35:05.475]  I hear you say that.
[00:35:05.575 --> 00:35:10.298]  As soon as I walked out of here, I was notified that they got the time zone wrong.
[00:35:10.318 --> 00:35:15.702]  They were trying to get me on an hour before while I was on air, but I'm going to be, I believe, on that tomorrow.
[00:35:16.062 --> 00:35:17.823]  We're going to do a tape delay interview in the morning.
[00:35:19.004 --> 00:35:20.205]  Oh, cool.
[00:35:20.345 --> 00:35:20.965]  I'm glad.
[00:35:21.005 --> 00:35:21.766]  That ought to be good.
[00:35:21.786 --> 00:35:24.307]  That will give you the opportunity to expose what you know.
[00:35:25.606 --> 00:35:27.447]  I'm guessing a primarily black audience.
[00:35:27.507 --> 00:35:28.808]  Yeah, well, it's a big show.
[00:35:29.188 --> 00:35:32.491]  It's a big show that's on quite a few AM and FM stations, I'm told.
[00:35:32.611 --> 00:35:33.691]  And it's out of D.C.
[00:35:33.751 --> 00:35:34.852]  It's a famous pastor.
[00:35:35.513 --> 00:35:37.294]  And it's on XM Radio.
[00:35:38.054 --> 00:35:38.355]  Cool.
[00:35:38.395 --> 00:35:38.815]  Very cool.
[00:35:38.835 --> 00:35:40.436]  I look forward to that.
[00:35:40.896 --> 00:35:44.078]  Second thing is that you've talked a lot about the breakup of the family.
[00:35:44.118 --> 00:35:51.063]  You used the example of Julius Caesar and taking over the Gauls and also the black family.
[00:35:51.693 --> 00:35:53.574]  Well, are you yourself a black American?
[00:35:53.594 --> 00:35:53.814]  I am.
[00:36:18.095 --> 00:36:22.677]  Well, number one, I haven't watched a lot of Oprah Winfrey, and I think she's a talented, smart person.
[00:36:22.717 --> 00:36:28.280]  What she said about mad cow and the spongy form and cellulopathy in humans is accurate.
[00:36:29.200 --> 00:36:37.284]  And again, I'm not here bashing black women when I simply talk about the... I mean, as a black man, I'm just curious.
[00:36:37.904 --> 00:36:40.485]  Because most people I know, white, black, it doesn't matter, aren't aware of this.
[00:36:40.825 --> 00:36:43.847]  Were you aware of how black men were kept down and the women were brought into the house?
[00:36:45.296 --> 00:36:46.297]  Yeah, somewhat I was.
[00:36:46.337 --> 00:36:47.878]  I've never seen doctors like you have.
[00:36:47.998 --> 00:36:49.719]  You got me deep there, but yeah, it makes sense.
[00:36:49.859 --> 00:36:53.662]  I don't want to know if it makes sense, Robert.
[00:36:53.702 --> 00:36:55.824]  I want to know if you as a black man ever heard that.
[00:36:57.188 --> 00:36:57.348]  Yes.
[00:36:57.669 --> 00:36:58.229]  Yes, I have.
[00:36:58.529 --> 00:36:58.790]  Okay.
[00:36:59.470 --> 00:37:09.401]  My whole point is, if the media wanted to make a black man a big TV star and show a black man as a leader on television, I guarantee you he'd get higher ratings than Oprah Winfrey.
[00:37:10.202 --> 00:37:14.586]  The media only wants to show black men as rap stars, hip-hop.
[00:37:14.606 --> 00:37:16.969]  They only want to show black men as sports stars.
[00:37:17.149 --> 00:37:19.051]  It's the same thing that Bill Coffey said.
[00:37:19.091 --> 00:37:19.652]  I agree with him.
[00:37:20.265 --> 00:37:41.700]  They show black men like a bunch of animals, and they put that message out, and they show white men like a bunch of animals, and they show Hispanics like a bunch of animals, and there is a concerted effort by this government and by Time Life and then Miss Magazine to show men as a bunch of miscreant idiots, and I use the example of black men because it's been done to them the longest and the hardest in this country.
[00:37:42.460 --> 00:37:45.162]  And it worked wonderfully, didn't it?
[00:37:46.603 --> 00:37:47.804]  Yeah, it has worked real well.
[00:37:48.522 --> 00:37:49.802]  Okay, that makes sense.
[00:37:49.842 --> 00:37:50.702]  Thanks for explaining to me.
[00:37:50.943 --> 00:37:59.624]  Last thing, I want to throw an alternative viewpoint at you, if I may, and I saw this on Blockout Radio, an internet show that comes out of Canada.
[00:38:00.965 --> 00:38:04.545]  You say that there were bombs in 12 buildings and that's what brought it down.
[00:38:04.605 --> 00:38:05.066]  Makes sense.
[00:38:06.046 --> 00:38:07.526]  Let me throw another angle at you.
[00:38:07.926 --> 00:38:16.128]  If that's true, why didn't the buildings blow up upon impact when the planes went into them
[00:38:16.664 --> 00:38:21.472]  Wouldn't the plane have hit bombs on those floors and then detonated them at that point?
[00:38:21.552 --> 00:38:23.736]  That's not how plastic explosives work.
[00:38:24.737 --> 00:38:33.521]  And yes, it does appear that there were some secondary explosions, whether that was gas mains or whether that was chemicals that were being stored.
[00:38:34.161 --> 00:38:49.188]  There were some secondary explosions, but to detonate plastic explosives, and I know explosives experts, though I've talked to them, my understanding is you've got to have direct explosive energy directly onto the plastic explosives if it's not an electrical charge.
[00:38:50.148 --> 00:39:14.922]  ...activating those, and so it makes perfect sense to have the aircraft fly into the buildings and then have pre-placed charges above and below, then detonate, just like with Building 7, nothing hit it, but still you even see the blast point squibs ejecting in a symmetrical fashion along the lines of major support columns, detonating one second before the collapse begins.
[00:39:15.862 --> 00:39:18.223]  I mean, if you watch the Building 7 videos closely, sir, you see...
[00:39:20.683 --> 00:39:20.923]  Sure.
[00:39:20.943 --> 00:39:21.084]  Yeah.
[00:39:32.375 --> 00:39:34.837]  And then remember the firefighters saying, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom?
[00:39:34.897 --> 00:39:35.678]  The floors came down.
[00:39:35.698 --> 00:39:36.038]  Remember that?
[00:39:36.078 --> 00:39:36.779]  Well, exactly.
[00:39:36.799 --> 00:39:38.560]  That's where the evidence is, yeah.
[00:39:38.901 --> 00:39:40.362]  And he was right there closer than we were.
[00:39:40.622 --> 00:39:45.406]  We have a new video clip that was from CNN that was uncovered with the police and firemen going, get back!
[00:39:45.686 --> 00:39:46.727]  It's Building 7 behind them.
[00:39:46.947 --> 00:39:47.368]  Get back!
[00:39:47.408 --> 00:39:48.469]  It's about to collapse!
[00:39:48.789 --> 00:39:49.930]  It's about to come down!
[00:39:50.350 --> 00:39:51.652]  And then, boom, it starts falling.
[00:39:52.372 --> 00:39:53.133]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:39:53.393 --> 00:39:53.773]  Makes sense.
[00:39:54.194 --> 00:39:55.074]  Okay, man, God bless.
[00:39:55.094 --> 00:39:55.715]  Give us the good work.
[00:39:56.035 --> 00:39:56.556]  Thank you.
[00:39:56.676 --> 00:39:59.058]  I've talked to probably 30-plus people.
[00:39:59.719 --> 00:40:02.481]  And I heard it that day, too, and we can't find the tapes.
[00:40:03.182 --> 00:40:04.343]  We haven't been able to.
[00:40:04.443 --> 00:40:11.308]  I've called NPR myself and asked them to go pull it, and I've looked for Internet clips of New York Public Radio live broadcasts that day.
[00:40:11.348 --> 00:40:12.248]  Maybe you can find it.
[00:40:12.669 --> 00:40:13.990]  NPR never called me back.
[00:40:14.050 --> 00:40:15.611]  We called them, I think, two or three times.
[00:40:16.431 --> 00:40:18.293]  But it was on NPR radio.
[00:40:20.001 --> 00:40:28.610]  And I talked to so many New Yorkers in my trips there, and on the phone and via email, who heard NPR say, Building 7 is going to be brought down for everyone's safety.
[00:40:28.950 --> 00:40:30.271]  That's why it's been evacuated.
[00:40:30.331 --> 00:40:31.052]  It's going to come down.
[00:40:31.072 --> 00:40:34.075]  They're going to bring it down, not to damage other buildings.
[00:40:34.936 --> 00:40:35.316]  Okay?
[00:40:36.958 --> 00:40:43.685]  And I remember hearing it on ABC radio, driving in my car,
[00:40:45.820 --> 00:40:52.842]  I was doing broadcast off and on that whole day here on Genesis, but for some reason I was in the car, and I was coming back, and I remember hearing it.
[00:40:53.722 --> 00:41:00.765]  I wasn't at home when Building 7 fell at 5.30 Eastern, I guess 4.30 Central.
[00:41:01.005 --> 00:41:03.385]  Then I got home and had two VCRs running at that time.
[00:41:03.405 --> 00:41:04.206]  We didn't have DVRs.
[00:41:04.226 --> 00:41:07.767]  We still had VCRs recording, and I got it on tape.
[00:41:08.387 --> 00:41:09.907]  And so did some of the other people around the country.
[00:41:09.927 --> 00:41:10.788]  That's how we have that video.
[00:41:10.808 --> 00:41:11.968]  A lot of it they never showed again.
[00:41:12.980 --> 00:41:19.523]  But I remember hearing ABC Radio reporting they were going to bring down 7, 7 was going to fall.
[00:41:20.984 --> 00:41:27.747]  Now, I also remember listeners calling and saying, hey, I saw television, they said get back, it's coming down.
[00:41:27.807 --> 00:41:30.027]  Well, now we have two of those videos.
[00:41:30.668 --> 00:41:35.750]  We have one with firemen, one with police and firemen, two separate clips that have just surfaced in the last month.
[00:41:36.831 --> 00:41:38.432]  That we've posted.
[00:41:38.492 --> 00:41:51.376]  So as millions of you out there go through those tapes, go through those recordings, or people at the networks have sent us stuff in the past and told us, please don't tell anybody we sent this to you, more and more of it's coming out.
[00:41:51.456 --> 00:41:58.598]  I guarantee you, in your closet, in the back of your entertainment center, you've got a VHS tape marked 9-11.
[00:41:59.299 --> 00:42:00.579]  And it's got stuff we need.
[00:42:01.391 --> 00:42:06.296]  I mean, again, it's like the CIA officer Steele said last week on the show.
[00:42:06.317 --> 00:42:14.946]  We're a huge organic intelligence network all working together in tandem, ferreting out all this, documenting this, tracking all this, and that's how we're beating them.
[00:42:16.252 --> 00:42:26.241]  And the CIA is openly panicking, saying they've got to mimic the new research, open code research, that's being done by the American people and people globally.
[00:42:26.741 --> 00:42:30.744]  With the power of search engines, that's why the CIA has now moved into Google and is controlling it.
[00:42:31.085 --> 00:42:33.166]  They're now blocking us out of Google News.
[00:42:33.186 --> 00:42:36.990]  They're now blocking our videos, manipulating the counters, erasing the counters.
[00:42:37.270 --> 00:42:38.050]  It's all admitted.
[00:42:38.691 --> 00:42:41.734]  And they're having to do this to try to adulterate the data stream.
[00:42:41.754 --> 00:42:42.915]  They're doing it at Yahoo.
[00:42:43.375 --> 00:42:44.396]  They're doing it at Google.
[00:42:45.460 --> 00:42:50.162]  We need to start supporting some of the alternative search engines, though they're not as powerful as Google and Yahoo.
[00:42:52.122 --> 00:42:53.843]  So we're having a huge effect here.
[00:42:54.583 --> 00:42:59.204]  There's millions of you running around ferreting things out, and I salute you, I commend you.
[00:42:59.504 --> 00:43:01.125]  We couldn't do what we do without you.
[00:43:01.145 --> 00:43:02.025]  I mean, here's an example.
[00:43:03.963 --> 00:43:04.463]  What was it?
[00:43:04.523 --> 00:43:09.405]  Early 2003, I get an email, and it's somebody saying, hey, I emailed this out to a couple other sites.
[00:43:10.045 --> 00:43:12.866]  This is PBS documentary, America Rebuilds.
[00:43:12.926 --> 00:43:17.767]  And there was the clip, and I went ahead and ordered the video, and somebody else sent me the original video.
[00:43:18.488 --> 00:43:20.928]  PBS Video doesn't ever stop selling a video.
[00:43:20.968 --> 00:43:23.929]  I mean, they always sell their Nova specials, their other specials, forever.
[00:43:24.810 --> 00:43:25.810]  They quit selling that.
[00:43:26.835 --> 00:43:30.437]  But we were able to order a copy and get another VHS copy that a listener sent us.
[00:43:30.917 --> 00:43:32.537]  And there's Larry Silverstein there singing.
[00:43:32.557 --> 00:43:38.580]  But I first got that video clip and a few other sites posted it simultaneously.
[00:43:38.720 --> 00:43:42.221]  PrisonPlanet.com at the time, that was big enough to really hit a major audience.
[00:43:42.321 --> 00:43:47.103]  And that broke and has been the biggest 9-11 story ongoing for the last three years.
[00:43:48.924 --> 00:43:55.887]  So, again, that happened because one of you was watching PBS, saw it hidden in plain view with him saying they blew up the building.
[00:43:57.092 --> 00:43:57.893]  And it's the same thing.
[00:43:57.913 --> 00:43:59.194]  This stuff's hidden in plain view.
[00:43:59.554 --> 00:44:01.976]  You know, I remember saying, hey, we saw it on CNN.
[00:44:02.016 --> 00:44:03.096]  Hey, we heard it on the radio.
[00:44:03.517 --> 00:44:04.197]  You called in.
[00:44:04.237 --> 00:44:05.278]  Yeah, I saw it too.
[00:44:05.658 --> 00:44:06.679]  I wish we had that.
[00:44:06.739 --> 00:44:08.000]  Well, it's surfacing.
[00:44:08.660 --> 00:44:10.081]  And more is going to surface.
[00:44:10.742 --> 00:44:11.822]  It's just going to continue.
[00:44:13.604 --> 00:44:24.051]  And Robert Baer, the big CIA covert operations chief, he's going to be scheduled on this show very soon.
[00:44:24.071 --> 00:44:25.292]  We just talked to him yesterday.
[00:44:26.278 --> 00:44:31.280]  Because we found some of the things he'd said that haven't seemed to be picked up for some reason about 9-11 being an inside job.
[00:44:31.300 --> 00:44:32.140]  We're going to have him on.
[00:44:33.720 --> 00:44:35.321]  We had Robert Steele on last week.
[00:44:35.361 --> 00:44:40.142]  We had Bill Christensen, who was a CIA division head over foreign threat intelligence.
[00:44:40.582 --> 00:44:44.103]  This guy was in the top ten of the CIA, saying total inside job.
[00:44:44.464 --> 00:44:45.624]  They're just all defecting.
[00:44:46.064 --> 00:44:48.245]  And these people are predominantly conservatives.
[00:44:48.845 --> 00:44:52.226]  Ray McGovern's saying clearly government's involved in terror and 9-11's a cover-up.
[00:44:53.860 --> 00:44:59.202]  I mean, he was the White House briefer for Reagan and Bush over the daily briefing.
[00:44:59.262 --> 00:45:00.423]  Very high-level CIA.
[00:45:00.463 --> 00:45:01.263]  The upper echelon.
[00:45:02.384 --> 00:45:03.384]  The highest echelon.
[00:45:04.505 --> 00:45:14.629]  And it just, if you're a real American and you want the truth and you really look at 9-11 and not the straw men and not the diversions and not the kooky stuff that's out there that the COINTELPRO people try to spew.
[00:45:15.715 --> 00:45:27.462]  If you really look at the meat and potatoes, bombs in the buildings, NORAD standing down, CIA insider trading, public officials warned not to fly, CIA drills of flying hijacked jets in the World Trade Center and Pentagon.
[00:45:27.984 --> 00:45:31.126]  If you really look at real evidence, 44,000 U.S.
[00:45:31.466 --> 00:45:42.172]  troops, 18,000 British troops, massing to Zikistan, who's bigger than, in the months before 9-11, Bush having the launch order to attack Afghanistan on his desk two days before, listing terrorism as the reason for the attack.
[00:45:42.452 --> 00:45:44.594]  I mean, that's Newsweek, but it's hidden in plain view.
[00:45:44.994 --> 00:45:51.898]  We need to take that and educate people and show them that and 600 and something other points that are incontrovertible.
[00:45:52.298 --> 00:45:53.799]  The hijackers trained at U.S.
[00:45:53.859 --> 00:45:55.400]  bases, not debatable.
[00:45:56.224 --> 00:45:57.065]  I mean, we got them.
[00:45:57.085 --> 00:46:01.069]  And you show that to real CIA analysts, real defense intelligence analysts.
[00:46:01.610 --> 00:46:04.052]  You show that to real people that really have studied this.
[00:46:04.072 --> 00:46:09.378]  They go, my gosh, this is classic black ops with decoys, with patsies.
[00:46:09.558 --> 00:46:10.319]  This is an op.
[00:46:10.899 --> 00:46:12.161]  There's no other way to say it.
[00:46:12.481 --> 00:46:13.562]  And who's got the motive?
[00:46:13.622 --> 00:46:14.283]  The globalists.
[00:46:14.583 --> 00:46:16.585]  Who wrote in PNAC they needed terror attacks?
[00:46:16.625 --> 00:46:17.246]  The globalists.
[00:46:17.904 --> 00:46:19.485]  Who has gained from it?
[00:46:19.705 --> 00:46:20.325]  The globalists.
[00:46:20.665 --> 00:46:26.088]  Who's butchered our Bill of Rights and abolished the Bill of Rights and abolished Posse Comitatus in the last month?
[00:46:26.288 --> 00:46:28.469]  The globalists, the neocons, the Bushes.
[00:46:31.070 --> 00:46:32.730]  And their willing accomplices in the media.
[00:46:34.631 --> 00:46:36.412]  Both fake conservative and fake liberal.
[00:46:36.432 --> 00:46:45.756]  Well, all the Nancy Pelosi's and all the Rush Limbaugh's and all the John Kerry's and all the Hillary's being endorsed by Rupert Murdoch, they can't put Humpty Dumpty back together again.
[00:46:47.418 --> 00:46:51.640]  Okay, they can kill a few patriot leaders, they can intimidate people, they can audit, they can do whatever they want.
[00:46:51.981 --> 00:46:54.442]  They can't stop an idea.
[00:46:54.482 --> 00:46:56.263]  Ideas are bulletproof.
[00:46:57.164 --> 00:47:03.487]  And there's just too many of us that are committed, and too many of us that are ready to fight to the death, and too many of us that just don't care anymore.
[00:47:04.368 --> 00:47:13.313]  I've got a better verbal flourish there, but I'm not going to use it, because I try this as a family show, and I'm a Christian, I don't like to use the Lord's name in vain, but I'm here to tell you that we just don't care.
[00:47:14.807 --> 00:47:16.969]  I mean, listen, I'm going all the way.
[00:47:17.069 --> 00:47:17.710]  I don't care.
[00:47:18.050 --> 00:47:27.259]  And it's hard to deal with people that don't care anymore, that don't care what their neighbors think, and don't care what the police think, and don't care what goons think, and who aren't intimidated.
[00:47:30.202 --> 00:47:31.684]  Oh, man, I'm not going to get mad.
[00:47:31.744 --> 00:47:32.745]  It's been exhausting me.
[00:47:32.765 --> 00:47:33.746]  I've been getting so mad lately.
[00:47:33.846 --> 00:47:38.210]  I need to do this in a loving way because I love my family and my country, not because I hate them.
[00:47:40.282 --> 00:47:41.223]  Hate will burn you out.
[00:47:41.323 --> 00:47:43.484]  Love will buoy you and give you endless strength.
[00:47:43.524 --> 00:47:44.245]  I have to remember that.
[00:47:44.285 --> 00:47:47.306]  I've been laxing into just frothing hatred lately.
[00:47:47.927 --> 00:47:48.747]  Boiling hatred.
[00:47:48.787 --> 00:47:51.789]  Because I just... They're killing the country right now.
[00:47:51.809 --> 00:47:52.830]  I mean, people are waking up.
[00:47:52.870 --> 00:47:53.850]  Yeah, as we always say.
[00:47:53.870 --> 00:47:57.173]  When they finally started dismembering the country, people would wake up.
[00:47:58.834 --> 00:48:01.675]  And if you think people are waking up right now, wait until they plunge the economy.
[00:48:01.976 --> 00:48:03.336]  Wait until they grab your pension funds.
[00:48:03.617 --> 00:48:05.718]  Wait until they devalue your dollar and let you know they did.
[00:48:05.738 --> 00:48:05.838]  Wait.
[00:48:05.858 --> 00:48:06.819]  Just wait.
[00:48:06.899 --> 00:48:07.419]  Just wait.
[00:48:09.518 --> 00:48:10.599]  Then people are really going to get mad.
[00:48:10.619 --> 00:48:12.300]  That's why they've got their police state in place.
[00:48:13.940 --> 00:48:23.724]  Let me just tell the police, if you go along with this system, if you go along with oppressing the people, you've just destroyed your best only hope of any liberty and any freedom for you and your children and your wife or your husband.
[00:48:25.225 --> 00:48:28.006]  You better choose sides and decide whose side you're on.
[00:48:28.246 --> 00:48:29.427]  Do you stand with the Republic?
[00:48:29.687 --> 00:48:31.787]  Do you stand with George Washington and Patrick Henry?
[00:48:32.468 --> 00:48:33.928]  Do you stand with Jesus Christ?
[00:48:34.369 --> 00:48:35.969]  Or do you stand with Beelzebub?
[00:48:36.009 --> 00:48:37.770]  And I mean, it really comes down to that.
[00:48:38.700 --> 00:48:40.282]  You've got to decide who you fear more.
[00:48:40.582 --> 00:48:42.904]  Do you fear man more than you fear God?
[00:48:42.924 --> 00:48:48.410]  Because if you fear man, God will allow you to be judged by this system.
[00:48:49.211 --> 00:48:50.732]  Robert in California, thanks for holding.
[00:48:50.772 --> 00:48:51.353]  You're on the air.
[00:48:51.793 --> 00:48:55.457]  Hello, Robert.
[00:48:55.577 --> 00:48:55.918]  Welcome.
[00:48:56.498 --> 00:48:57.219]  Good morning, Alex.
[00:48:57.519 --> 00:49:02.044]  I went to Barnes & Noble and your video wasn't there.
[00:49:03.610 --> 00:49:06.433]  Yes, the distributor talked to them this morning.
[00:49:06.633 --> 00:49:14.079]  Thousands were delivered to Barnes & Noble, 500 and something nationwide to Borders, and they've been delivered everywhere, and they're not being put on the shelves.
[00:49:14.139 --> 00:49:21.926]  And before I make this a big controversy, I have to do more research, but we know they've been delivered, and we know for some reason they're not putting them on shelves.
[00:49:21.966 --> 00:49:29.172]  And look, Paul Craig Roberts, Colonel Craig Roberts, here on this show, I always mix it up,
[00:49:29.901 --> 00:49:32.763]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts and Colonel Craig Roberts, both good friends of mine.
[00:49:33.103 --> 00:49:36.586]  But Colonel Craig Roberts had three best-selling books.
[00:49:36.726 --> 00:49:41.549]  One of them sold millions of copies, one shot, one kill, a Marine Corps sniper in Vietnam.
[00:49:42.453 --> 00:49:43.834]  And it didn't matter.
[00:49:43.874 --> 00:49:46.075]  As soon as he wrote anti-New World Order books, it didn't matter.
[00:49:46.455 --> 00:49:48.857]  They would deliver them to the bookstores and not put them on the shelves.
[00:49:49.397 --> 00:49:49.597]  Right.
[00:49:49.797 --> 00:49:52.639]  So before I make a big, you know, we caught Google censoring.
[00:49:52.679 --> 00:49:53.419]  They had to admit it.
[00:49:53.439 --> 00:49:54.460]  They claimed it was an accident.
[00:49:54.700 --> 00:49:55.840]  They did it multiple times.
[00:49:56.321 --> 00:50:01.964]  Before we say that this is happening, but yeah, people are going to stores that show that they've been delivered to.
[00:50:02.464 --> 00:50:05.025]  Two days ago now, I was supposed to go on the store shelves yesterday.
[00:50:06.766 --> 00:50:08.227]  What did the store say when you went to this one?
[00:50:08.727 --> 00:50:12.469]  When I went to there, they said, well, we have it if you order it.
[00:50:12.769 --> 00:50:15.370]  So you can go ahead and order it, and you'll get it for three to five days.
[00:50:16.030 --> 00:50:21.372]  That's exactly what Craig Roberts and all the other, and these aren't just some author who never had success, so it's sour grapes.
[00:50:21.452 --> 00:50:21.592]  No.
[00:50:21.932 --> 00:50:29.215]  These are people I know who've had bestsellers, and then they have new books that are even on the top Amazon charts, and it doesn't matter.
[00:50:29.955 --> 00:50:31.976]  They will not put his books on the shelves.
[00:50:32.879 --> 00:50:34.360]  And I am sick and tired of it.
[00:50:34.961 --> 00:50:36.623]  And, yeah, they've got them.
[00:50:36.663 --> 00:50:39.605]  They've got them at their stores, and they're not sticking them on the shelves.
[00:50:42.068 --> 00:50:42.968]  Does that make you mad?
[00:50:43.529 --> 00:50:45.070]  That makes me furious.
[00:50:45.431 --> 00:50:46.432]  Well, that's what you want.
[00:50:46.472 --> 00:50:47.012]  We're hurting them.
[00:50:47.413 --> 00:50:47.693]  Stay there.
[00:50:47.713 --> 00:50:49.054]  I'm going to finish up when we get back on the other side.
[00:50:49.074 --> 00:50:53.578]  I mean, they're not going to let us just take back the country without a fight.
[00:50:54.179 --> 00:50:54.859]  We'll be right back.
[00:50:54.879 --> 00:50:55.500]  Stay with us.
[00:51:05.069 --> 00:51:08.232]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[00:51:08.572 --> 00:51:10.493]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[00:51:10.894 --> 00:51:18.560]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:19.240 --> 00:51:26.286]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.

[00:54:48.410 --> 00:54:51.072]  All right, going back to Robert in California, then Steve, Sam, and any others.

[00:54:54.474 --> 00:54:58.877]  I'll take more calls into the next hour, then I've got to get into Baghdad collapsing, what's happening with the election.
[00:54:59.097 --> 00:55:00.238]  Very important broadcast today.
[00:55:00.258 --> 00:55:04.081]  And I don't want to spend all day just talking about myself and the video terror storm.
[00:55:04.141 --> 00:55:05.202]  We had an overflow crowd.
[00:55:05.262 --> 00:55:07.924]  I'd say 200 people were there over the hour and a half.
[00:55:08.744 --> 00:55:12.066]  I gave a speech for 30 minutes, took questions for 30 minutes, signed for about 45 minutes.
[00:55:13.428 --> 00:55:18.510]  And Waterloo has had a lot of big documentary filmmakers and musicians.
[00:55:19.110 --> 00:55:23.872]  Famous folks there said they've never had a signing line this big, never had a crowd this big.
[00:55:24.212 --> 00:55:27.533]  You couldn't walk inside the place when it really filled up.
[00:55:28.874 --> 00:55:30.174]  And it was great seeing you all there.
[00:55:30.514 --> 00:55:37.197]  And there are thousands of independent places around the country that believe in Terror Storm and that ordered some of them each store hundreds.
[00:55:38.938 --> 00:55:40.558]  Barnes & Noble did take delivery.
[00:55:41.358 --> 00:55:42.499]  So did Borders and others.
[00:55:43.360 --> 00:55:46.323]  And I talked to the distributor this morning.
[00:55:46.363 --> 00:55:47.243]  They have the slips.
[00:55:47.304 --> 00:55:54.269]  They know how many were delivered where, who got what, and they are just not giving it to folks.
[00:55:54.950 --> 00:55:56.271]  They are not stocking it.
[00:55:56.291 --> 00:55:57.512]  I guess they're just sending it back.
[00:55:58.853 --> 00:56:00.334]  I guess the word got out.
[00:56:00.835 --> 00:56:05.058]  And we know this has happened over and over and over and over again.
[00:56:05.859 --> 00:56:09.802]  Robert in California, exactly what did they say to you when you tried to get Terror Storm?
[00:56:09.822 --> 00:56:10.283]  What did they say?
[00:56:10.822 --> 00:56:19.384]  Well, in Barnes & Noble, they said, we don't stock it unless we order it specifically, but if you order it, we'll get it for you.
[00:56:19.544 --> 00:56:22.125]  And Borders says, well, we have one, but we can't find it.
[00:56:23.485 --> 00:56:24.966]  And that's the same thing I've been told.
[00:56:25.326 --> 00:56:31.367]  We've gotten probably 50 emails, MySpace postings, phone calls, the distributors getting the same calls.
[00:56:31.387 --> 00:56:34.428]  They've all gotten them, they all have them, and they're just saying they don't have them.
[00:56:35.063 --> 00:56:36.103]  Yeah, and that's true.
[00:56:36.123 --> 00:56:37.784]  By the way, this is a big label, folks.
[00:56:37.804 --> 00:56:39.404]  They put out all the Robert Greenwald films.
[00:56:39.684 --> 00:56:40.725]  They put out Outfoxed.
[00:56:41.045 --> 00:56:42.445]  They put out best-selling books.
[00:56:43.065 --> 00:56:45.346]  They put out Bear, you know, the guy that wrote Siriana.
[00:56:45.366 --> 00:56:46.466]  They just put out his new book.
[00:56:46.766 --> 00:56:50.447]  I mean, it's not like my distributor is Mr. Tiddlywinks.
[00:56:51.107 --> 00:56:51.588]  Right, right.
[00:56:52.268 --> 00:56:56.249]  Also, you know, the political redistricting of Ron Paul's...
[00:56:57.893 --> 00:57:01.677]  In Texas, it's called political gerrymandering.
[00:57:01.717 --> 00:57:04.660]  Before, they used to do it by race, and they found out they couldn't do that anymore.
[00:57:04.680 --> 00:57:09.345]  And they call it a gerrymander because they looked at a district up north when they did it, and it looked like a salamander.
[00:57:09.865 --> 00:57:10.106]  Right.
[00:57:10.566 --> 00:57:17.994]  And so usually the gerrymandering is for a political safe district, sort of like we have David Dreyer out here.
[00:57:18.094 --> 00:57:20.076]  He's been reelected over and over again because...
[00:57:20.655 --> 00:57:22.836]  He gets redistricted into a Republican safe.
[00:57:23.336 --> 00:57:26.217]  Yeah, it should just be done in squares.
[00:57:26.837 --> 00:57:28.858]  Just, you know, random geographic squares.
[00:57:28.898 --> 00:57:30.859]  But instead, so everybody's together.
[00:57:31.199 --> 00:57:35.820]  Instead, they make it black districts, Hispanic districts, white districts, Democrat districts, Republican districts.
[00:57:36.461 --> 00:57:36.701]  Right.
[00:57:37.061 --> 00:57:41.102]  And I don't know if you remember that one with Dornan and Sanchez.
[00:57:41.542 --> 00:57:42.323]  See, his failed.
[00:57:42.363 --> 00:57:44.943]  That's why he was so upset, because he thought he had a political safe.
[00:57:45.023 --> 00:57:49.325]  And his more Democrats moved in than Republicans moved out.
[00:57:49.918 --> 00:58:01.021]  And so he was all upset, but this is the first time I've ever seen him do it to actually take out what I would consider the wrong... Oh, no, they targeted Senator Bob Smith in New Hampshire and got him out a real conservative.
[00:58:01.041 --> 00:58:02.421]  His voting record is as good as Paul's.
[00:58:02.841 --> 00:58:08.062]  They targeted Tom Tancredo publicly, and they've now targeted Ron Paul for the third straight election.
[00:58:08.622 --> 00:58:10.843]  Yeah, I'm sorry to hear that, because one of the few...
[00:58:11.676 --> 00:58:13.916]  True Americans and patriots are here.
[00:58:13.956 --> 00:58:15.857]  He's got a real sniveler against him.
[00:58:15.897 --> 00:58:17.677]  The Democrat is an atrocious demon.
[00:58:18.217 --> 00:58:27.139]  And Ron Paul has a perfect Second Amendment voting record, and the traitorous NRA has given him a B and given the sniveling Democrat creature an A+.
[00:58:27.379 --> 00:58:29.119]  Okay, well, thank you, Alex.
[00:58:29.159 --> 00:58:29.719]  Have a good day.
[00:58:29.839 --> 00:58:30.600]  Hey, I appreciate it.
[00:58:30.640 --> 00:58:36.181]  I mean, folks ought to be boiling mad at the NRA, showing themselves to be gun-grabbing traitors yet again.
[00:58:36.201 --> 00:58:37.941]  In fact, I'll prove that when we get back.
[00:58:37.961 --> 00:58:38.361]  Stay with me.
[00:58:41.556 --> 00:58:46.398]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-300-7645.
[00:58:46.438 --> 00:58:46.898]  Big Brother.
[00:58:47.058 --> 00:58:47.819]  Mainstream media.
[00:58:48.039 --> 00:58:50.880]  Government cover-ups.
[00:58:50.920 --> 00:58:56.322]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.335 --> 00:59:05.215]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.235 --> 00:59:09.836]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.056 --> 00:59:14.177]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:32.831 --> 00:59:36.293]  We're only six days away from the 2006 midterm elections.
[00:59:36.353 --> 00:59:37.774]  I'd love to get your take on that.
[00:59:38.094 --> 00:59:40.615]  Bush and Rove are saying they're going to win everything.
[00:59:40.976 --> 00:59:42.336]  They're not going to lose any seats.
[00:59:43.217 --> 00:59:47.459]  All of the polling data, all of this, the sentiment of the public, you know people are mad out there.
[00:59:47.479 --> 00:59:48.780]  It doesn't matter.
[00:59:49.180 --> 00:59:52.082]  They just smile and say, no, no, no, you're wrong.
[00:59:52.562 --> 00:59:56.904]  And they'll probably be proven right again because they can steal the election in at least 35% of the country.
[00:59:57.325 --> 01:00:01.307]  They're dispatching, quote, federal monitors to run things and steal things for Lord Bush.
[01:00:01.977 --> 01:00:09.480]  They've been caught with Republicans jamming phone lines, taking people's names off the voter list, engaged in every type of crime you can imagine.
[01:00:10.320 --> 01:00:10.900]  It doesn't matter.
[01:00:10.920 --> 01:00:15.602]  They're just rampaging forward with their cult-like followers bleating behind them.
[01:00:16.202 --> 01:00:20.643]  30% of America that would sell their children to slavery if Bush said it.
[01:00:21.203 --> 01:00:23.584]  They'd probably kneel before Satan if he said it was Christian.
[01:00:25.465 --> 01:00:26.205]  It's craziness.
[01:00:26.485 --> 01:00:27.586]  Baghdad is imploding.
[01:00:27.626 --> 01:00:28.746]  We'll get into that report later.
[01:00:29.665 --> 01:00:39.829]  But I just got into how the NRA is giving an anti-Second Amendment Democrat weasel, who on his campaign website is posing with a shotgun.
[01:00:39.909 --> 01:00:43.190]  I mean, please, please.
[01:00:43.750 --> 01:00:46.972]  Who's for the animal ID and bought and paid for by Big Agra.
[01:00:49.413 --> 01:00:53.634]  This creature is running around against Ron Paul.
[01:00:53.654 --> 01:00:55.155]  They're saying Ron Paul may lose.
[01:00:57.088 --> 01:00:58.928]  They've gerrymandered his district.
[01:00:59.668 --> 01:01:02.009]  It doesn't matter that he's wildly popular here in Texas.
[01:01:02.289 --> 01:01:05.069]  And I mentioned that the NRA is globalist controlled.
[01:01:05.910 --> 01:01:07.110]  Now, Bob Barr is on the board.
[01:01:07.150 --> 01:01:07.830]  He may be good.
[01:01:08.190 --> 01:01:09.250]  Former CIA, by the way.
[01:01:10.090 --> 01:01:14.671]  And the congressman did say that Bush has been more anti-gun than Clinton, so he's been truthful there.
[01:01:14.691 --> 01:01:19.752]  And the NRA seems to be better the last two years since there was a shakeup there.
[01:01:19.872 --> 01:01:21.492]  But before that, it's still pretty bad.
[01:01:21.532 --> 01:01:22.933]  This evidence is their bad.
[01:01:23.153 --> 01:01:23.933]  Because they're lying.
[01:01:23.993 --> 01:01:24.433]  They give...
[01:01:25.220 --> 01:01:33.644]  A better grade to the sniveling person running against, I'm not going to say his name, give him attention, because we're on a lot of places here in Texas, against Paul.
[01:01:33.664 --> 01:01:35.645]  They're saying he's got a better grade.
[01:01:36.065 --> 01:01:37.946]  They are endorsing him over Ron Paul.
[01:01:40.888 --> 01:01:42.088]  This is a scandal.
[01:01:42.649 --> 01:01:43.389]  And it just shows.
[01:01:43.449 --> 01:01:49.652]  But remember two years ago, this was the last straw with many NRA supporters, this is why they finally had a shakeup at the board.
[01:01:51.255 --> 01:01:58.007]  In a federal case in D.C., the NRA lawyers argued that all guns should be registered and argued for gun control.
[01:01:58.868 --> 01:02:00.150]  And I've read the ruling.
[01:02:00.210 --> 01:02:05.179]  I mean, I've read the actual closing arguments of the NRA in that case here on air.
[01:02:06.850 --> 01:02:16.814]  And back in 1998, they were about to pass, excuse me, in 98 and 2000, it was actually 2000, they were about to pass a law banning anyone under 18 from touching a gun in Texas.
[01:02:17.254 --> 01:02:18.495]  It was going to ban Junior Olympics.
[01:02:18.515 --> 01:02:19.335]  It was all over the news.
[01:02:19.375 --> 01:02:22.817]  Josh Sugarman of Hangover Control Incorporated was running around giggling.
[01:02:23.717 --> 01:02:26.038]  I went down to the Capitol, caught bribery.
[01:02:26.058 --> 01:02:27.279]  It was in the front page of the paper.
[01:02:27.299 --> 01:02:28.359]  The video went on the web.
[01:02:28.379 --> 01:02:32.941]  A lot of you saw it before our servers crashed.
[01:02:33.261 --> 01:02:35.122]  I ought to refine that video and re-upload it.
[01:02:35.712 --> 01:02:36.832]  Caught the robbery on tape.
[01:02:36.872 --> 01:02:37.773]  You rarely do that.
[01:02:39.153 --> 01:02:41.573]  And the chairman got in trouble with the committee over it.
[01:02:41.753 --> 01:02:43.674]  It was pretty powerful, what happened.
[01:02:44.414 --> 01:02:50.916]  And the NRA and the Dallas Morning News came out and attacked the pro-gun groups here in Texas.
[01:02:52.836 --> 01:03:00.318]  They came out and attacked the groups and called us extreme and actually was for the gun control legislation.
[01:03:02.418 --> 01:03:03.139]  So I've lived it.
[01:03:04.019 --> 01:03:04.559]  I've lived it.
[01:03:05.937 --> 01:03:07.978]  And that's what the NRA is doing today.
[01:03:08.058 --> 01:03:11.038]  And this is just... We should get an article out on this.
[01:03:11.078 --> 01:03:13.659]  In fact, I'm going to tell Kevin Smith, Kevin, just write a blurb on this.
[01:03:14.339 --> 01:03:18.000]  Just go get how they give an endorsement to the sniveling person.
[01:03:18.040 --> 01:03:19.380]  We'll have to list his name in the article.
[01:03:20.261 --> 01:03:22.161]  Show that stupid picture of him with a gun up there.
[01:03:22.181 --> 01:03:28.383]  Why don't you talk about how they're using the clip of Ron Paul on this show against him in the campaign, playing it at public functions.
[01:03:29.483 --> 01:03:33.824]  And just write a little article about it, because we need to get this out so people don't just hear about it on the show.
[01:03:35.157 --> 01:03:36.939]  The power of text is unrivaled.
[01:03:37.920 --> 01:03:41.164]  Because it doesn't change as it's transferred person to person.
[01:03:41.184 --> 01:03:43.907]  Alright, but that's what's going on with the NRA.
[01:03:43.947 --> 01:03:49.453]  They're trying to shoot down the most pro-gun congressman we've got for a sniveling Democrat.
[01:03:49.954 --> 01:03:51.636]  That's how they are, attacking Republicans.
[01:03:51.936 --> 01:03:52.497]  We'll be right back.
[01:03:56.787 --> 01:03:59.968]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[01:04:00.308 --> 01:04:02.249]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[01:04:02.609 --> 01:04:10.271]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:04:10.951 --> 01:04:18.014]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:04:18.394 --> 01:04:21.355]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran.
[01:04:21.715 --> 01:04:24.056]  A White House program to disseminate fake news.
[01:04:24.476 --> 01:04:25.296]  NSA spies.
[01:04:26.471 --> 01:04:29.812]  The latest 9-11 information and much, much more.
[01:04:30.132 --> 01:04:33.633]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:04:34.093 --> 01:04:36.014]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:04:36.354 --> 01:04:40.275]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:05:40.454 --> 01:05:43.115]  The Berkey Security Pack, a retail value of $518 for only $399.
[01:05:45.896 --> 01:05:46.737]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:05:55.273 --> 01:05:56.594]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument.
[01:06:16.374 --> 01:06:17.134]  We're good to go.
[01:06:39.122 --> 01:06:39.743]  We're good to go.
[01:06:58.274 --> 01:06:58.915]  Big Brother.
[01:06:59.595 --> 01:07:00.636]  Mainstream media.
[01:07:01.356 --> 01:07:02.517]  Government cover-ups.
[01:07:03.117 --> 01:07:03.938]  You want answers?
[01:07:04.678 --> 01:07:06.599]  Well, so does he.
[01:07:06.619 --> 01:07:10.182]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:10.422 --> 01:07:14.545]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:07:14.745 --> 01:07:24.211]  Alright, during the break I confirmed what one of my staff told me and what two people at the event at Waterloo Music and Video told me last night.
[01:07:26.121 --> 01:07:36.529]  The embattled Congressman Ron Paul with the best pro-gun voting record in Congress, an A-plus by Gunners of America, A-plus by the John Birch Society, A-plus by everybody that looks at the voting records.
[01:07:37.930 --> 01:07:48.418]  The NRA is giving him a B and they're giving a higher rating in their printed magazines they're sending out to the Democrat running against him who believes in Second Amendment for hunting.
[01:07:49.500 --> 01:07:50.941]  So, he's anti-gun.
[01:07:51.241 --> 01:08:05.170]  The Democrat is clearly anti-gun, and so the NRA is telling us how wonderful he is while giving Ron Paul a B and not saying why they gave him a B. No anti-gun vote ever!
[01:08:06.510 --> 01:08:08.031]  Now, that's the type of treachery.
[01:08:08.572 --> 01:08:14.535]  Because they're not going to be able to disarm us unless they control the organizations that we go to to, quote, trust.
[01:08:15.896 --> 01:08:17.037]  And I've experienced the NRA...
[01:08:18.988 --> 01:08:38.052]  Demonize, in the Dallas Morning News, in below propaganda arm, several Texas gun groups, and demonize myself, back in 2000, because we were shooting down legislation that they were, quote, neutral on in the Texas legislature, in Juan Hinojosa's committee.
[01:08:39.472 --> 01:08:41.633]  His judiciary committee.
[01:08:42.593 --> 01:08:43.933]  Or it was the law enforcement committee.
[01:08:44.053 --> 01:08:44.853]  I forget which one.
[01:08:44.873 --> 01:08:47.914]  The point is, this is disgusting.
[01:08:48.945 --> 01:08:49.306]  We're good to go.
[01:09:05.484 --> 01:09:12.346]  And so they had a shake-up, and it looks like they're back to their same treacherous ways, and this is the exact type of stuff.
[01:09:12.826 --> 01:09:19.388]  I mean, meanwhile, Bush and Perry and everybody else are running around claiming they're pro-control-the-border, anti-illegal alien.
[01:09:19.428 --> 01:09:20.889]  That is the biggest lie.
[01:09:20.909 --> 01:09:24.269]  That's like saying Hitler's pro-Jew or something.
[01:09:24.350 --> 01:09:29.151]  I mean, it's just... It's a 180 from what reality is.
[01:09:30.731 --> 01:09:31.532]  And I just...
[01:09:34.677 --> 01:09:35.598]  It just makes me sick.
[01:09:36.738 --> 01:09:38.479]  It makes me totally and completely sick.
[01:09:39.339 --> 01:09:47.563]  By the way, we've confirmed the terror storm has been delivered to all of the Barnes and Nobles, all of the borders around the country.
[01:09:48.063 --> 01:09:52.365]  They will admit they have them in stock, but when you show up, they'll say, well, we can't get it for you.
[01:09:52.786 --> 01:09:53.626]  You've got to order it.
[01:09:54.879 --> 01:09:57.060]  We know that Barnes & Noble bought thousands.
[01:09:57.120 --> 01:10:01.143]  We know that Borders bought 540-something, my distributor said.
[01:10:01.783 --> 01:10:02.784]  And they're not selling them.
[01:10:02.804 --> 01:10:06.826]  They're not letting you have them, just like they do to Colonel Craig Roberts' books.
[01:10:08.007 --> 01:10:14.390]  And, by the way, a day and a half into being up on Amazon.com, it went from 7,000-plus in the DVDs to 154.
[01:10:14.550 --> 01:10:15.371]  It hit 154 late last night.
[01:10:15.851 --> 01:10:16.391]  That's incredible.
[01:10:23.576 --> 01:10:24.837]  We're good to go.
[01:10:49.628 --> 01:10:59.093]  It's important that we demonstrate the popularity of this film to show how popular it is and to show the censorship that's now going on in stores across this country.
[01:10:59.633 --> 01:11:11.279]  Go to InfoWars.com and you can find a link right there on the main page to get it off of Amazon.com or just go to Amazon.com and type Terror Storm in and you can get the film right there.
[01:11:13.115 --> 01:11:13.876]  We're good to go.
[01:11:27.992 --> 01:11:30.092]  Terror Storm from Amazon.com right now.
[01:11:30.172 --> 01:11:32.653]  I mean, if you've already bought a copy from me, thank you for the support.
[01:11:32.693 --> 01:11:33.613]  Look at it as a donation.
[01:11:34.013 --> 01:11:36.193]  Go back on and buy a couple copies at that price.
[01:11:36.233 --> 01:11:36.774]  You can't beat it.
[01:11:37.114 --> 01:11:38.354]  Give them as birthday presents.
[01:11:38.374 --> 01:11:39.054]  Give it to your neighbor.
[01:11:39.094 --> 01:11:40.274]  Just say, hey, I want you to have this.
[01:11:40.754 --> 01:11:41.514]  Support us.
[01:11:41.594 --> 01:11:43.575]  It's about getting the information out.
[01:11:43.595 --> 01:11:47.675]  Because if we get into the top 50, it will be a chain reaction.
[01:11:48.056 --> 01:11:50.696]  Because that's where most of the shopping is done is in that top 100.
[01:11:50.736 --> 01:11:52.676]  If you get into that top 50, it's over.
[01:11:52.796 --> 01:11:56.117]  Whatever gets into that top 50 or so, I've been told, tends to stay there.
[01:11:56.977 --> 01:11:58.638]  And Amazon is not censoring us.
[01:11:59.158 --> 01:12:00.838]  Amazon did buy them by the thousands.
[01:12:01.278 --> 01:12:06.740]  Amazon is posting it and letting you get it there and they ship it to you in just a couple days.
[01:12:06.760 --> 01:12:10.701]  In fact, I think if you buy it there, you get it for free shipping or something.
[01:12:10.721 --> 01:12:12.142]  It's just a ridiculous deal.
[01:12:12.662 --> 01:12:15.583]  And frankly, I'll lose money because I'm selling it for $19.95.
[01:12:16.043 --> 01:12:18.003]  I don't even care about making money anymore, folks.
[01:12:18.204 --> 01:12:19.524]  I just want to get the information out.
[01:12:21.551 --> 01:12:25.075]  In fact, since I put it out for free on Google Video, we've sold a lot less of it.
[01:12:25.375 --> 01:12:25.755]  I don't care.
[01:12:25.776 --> 01:12:26.917]  Get it for free at Google Video.
[01:12:26.937 --> 01:12:28.158]  But at the same time, support us.
[01:12:29.259 --> 01:12:30.080]  Get a great deal.
[01:12:30.200 --> 01:12:30.921]  I mean, $11.
[01:12:32.903 --> 01:12:35.405]  If you go to Amazon.com and get it, $11.
[01:12:35.966 --> 01:12:39.410]  I think it's like $14 in stores.
[01:12:40.350 --> 01:12:41.832]  And buy a bunch of copies of it.
[01:12:42.353 --> 01:12:44.635]  Buy it off their shelves if you find the stores that have it.
[01:12:45.302 --> 01:12:47.504]  And I'm asking listeners right now, I want you to call.
[01:12:47.804 --> 01:12:49.265]  Call Austin Barnes & Nobles.
[01:12:49.305 --> 01:12:50.246]  I haven't dropped by to see.
[01:12:50.766 --> 01:12:52.007]  Call Austin Barnes & Nobles.
[01:12:52.027 --> 01:12:53.508]  There's, I think, like five of them here in town.
[01:12:54.329 --> 01:12:59.253]  Call them and say, do you have Terror Storm by Alex Jones distributed by Disinformation?
[01:12:59.933 --> 01:13:02.195]  Well, you bought a bunch of them.
[01:13:02.215 --> 01:13:03.196]  Well, why don't you have them?
[01:13:03.216 --> 01:13:03.956]  Well, we want them.
[01:13:04.917 --> 01:13:06.438]  And we want them stocked in your store.
[01:13:06.458 --> 01:13:07.679]  We want to come down there and get them.
[01:13:09.734 --> 01:13:12.216]  And tell them, okay, well, I want three copies of it.
[01:13:12.236 --> 01:13:13.317]  And ask for your name and number.
[01:13:13.337 --> 01:13:14.698]  It doesn't even matter if you ever go get them.
[01:13:14.718 --> 01:13:16.539]  That way they'll be on their store shelves.
[01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:18.060]  Because I'm angry.
[01:13:19.181 --> 01:13:24.365]  You know, we get into the top 100 of Google Video, and they erase our stats and knock us out repeatedly and admit they did it.
[01:13:25.986 --> 01:13:29.269]  They ban us from Google News and block all of our news out of Google News.
[01:13:30.129 --> 01:13:31.991]  They block us on the web.
[01:13:32.011 --> 01:13:32.851]  We've caught them doing that.
[01:13:32.911 --> 01:13:35.233]  Now it's admitted the CIA is basically running them.
[01:13:36.181 --> 01:13:37.702]  They block us now out of the stores.
[01:13:38.242 --> 01:13:41.043]  And they're having to do this because the truth sells.
[01:13:41.363 --> 01:13:42.883]  And we can take this country back.
[01:13:43.304 --> 01:13:45.344]  But they want to stand in the way of that happening.
[01:13:47.345 --> 01:13:50.446]  So again, at the top of prisonplanet.com, there's a big link.
[01:13:50.466 --> 01:13:54.047]  You can't miss it to buy it at amazon.com or buy it from infowars.com.
[01:13:55.228 --> 01:13:55.608]  You know what?
[01:13:55.648 --> 01:13:58.449]  I'd rather just not make money and just get it from Amazon.
[01:13:59.207 --> 01:14:00.388]  I'd rather you just go there.
[01:14:00.408 --> 01:14:03.490]  By the way, you can get it even lower than Amazon.com.
[01:14:03.610 --> 01:14:04.091]  One place.
[01:14:04.671 --> 01:14:04.091]  $9.95.
[01:14:04.811 --> 01:14:16.940]  If you buy Aaron Russo's America, Freedom to Fascism for $19.95 with a combo deal for $9.95, you get Terror Storm if you choose to do the combo deal or get America, Freedom to Fascism by itself.
[01:14:17.360 --> 01:14:18.241]  And that number is...
[01:14:19.855 --> 01:14:25.542]  To get that combo deal is 888-253-3139, 888-253-3139, or you can simply write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 787-04.
[01:14:39.159 --> 01:14:41.101]  Or don't ever forget PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:14:41.221 --> 01:14:48.427]  All 15 of my films, my book, Paul Watson's book, my weekly TV reports, special video reports, in-studio reports, in super high quality bandwidth.
[01:14:48.447 --> 01:14:49.748]  You can download it, burn to disk.
[01:14:50.108 --> 01:14:51.129]  A great activist center.
[01:14:51.429 --> 01:14:52.730]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:14:53.190 --> 01:14:53.791]  15 cents a day.
[01:14:56.133 --> 01:14:56.893]  15 cents a day.
[01:14:56.913 --> 01:15:00.416]  And if you get a yearly membership, you get three months free.
[01:15:00.496 --> 01:15:01.237]  It's $5.95 a month.
[01:15:01.297 --> 01:15:03.199]  And if you get a yearly membership, again, you get three months free.
[01:15:04.099 --> 01:15:08.543]  In the next few days, we're about to launch a special to get the yearly membership.
[01:15:10.004 --> 01:15:12.025]  And you'll get, I think it's five months free.
[01:15:12.045 --> 01:15:12.865]  That's about to happen.
[01:15:13.265 --> 01:15:17.886]  So go try a monthly, and if you like it, get a yearly and get almost half a year free.
[01:15:17.906 --> 01:15:20.967]  I think it comes out to 5.3 months free with the deal we're going to offer.
[01:15:21.227 --> 01:15:24.508]  The same one we offered last year in November and December.
[01:15:26.589 --> 01:15:28.529]  So that is coming up.
[01:15:28.869 --> 01:15:30.410]  In fact, it's supposed to be launched today.
[01:15:30.430 --> 01:15:31.650]  I don't know if that was launched today.
[01:15:31.670 --> 01:15:32.830]  If not, it will be launched by tonight.
[01:15:35.672 --> 01:15:36.693]  Let's go back to your calls.
[01:15:37.354 --> 01:15:40.736]  Again, I'm hopping mad, though, because on a level playing field, we'll clean their clocks.
[01:15:41.517 --> 01:15:43.819]  That's why they're having to cheat and try to suppress this information.
[01:15:44.860 --> 01:15:46.521]  And again, I have the Times of London right here today.
[01:15:47.322 --> 01:15:48.963]  The rising threat of the new media.
[01:15:49.123 --> 01:15:51.385]  And they say that it's over for the mainstream media.
[01:15:52.366 --> 01:15:53.567]  CNN's saying the same thing.
[01:15:53.587 --> 01:15:54.648]  See, they're panicking.
[01:15:55.389 --> 01:15:56.950]  You aren't the gatekeepers anymore.
[01:15:56.990 --> 01:15:58.471]  You aren't in control anymore.
[01:16:00.333 --> 01:16:02.515]  Let's go ahead and talk to Steve and KC.
[01:16:02.575 --> 01:16:03.376]  Steve, thanks for holding.
[01:16:03.416 --> 01:16:03.776]  Go ahead.
[01:16:05.487 --> 01:16:05.807]  Hello, Alex.
[01:16:06.027 --> 01:16:06.167]  Hi.
[01:16:06.187 --> 01:16:07.487]  Hi, how you doing?
[01:16:07.627 --> 01:16:07.867]  Good.
[01:16:08.428 --> 01:16:10.128]  I've got a couple questions for you.
[01:16:10.408 --> 01:16:13.689]  One of them is, has your movie Terror Storm been introduced to Blockbuster?
[01:16:14.669 --> 01:16:20.630]  They refuse to carry it, and so do Hollywood Video, for political reasons, just as they did outfoxed.
[01:16:20.790 --> 01:16:24.630]  But you can pressure them, so I would call their regional offices.
[01:16:24.751 --> 01:16:26.091]  I would email them.
[01:16:26.131 --> 01:16:28.591]  They have a form on the Blockbuster website.
[01:16:28.611 --> 01:16:29.391]  We need your help.
[01:16:29.991 --> 01:16:30.372]  Right on.
[01:16:30.912 --> 01:16:31.692]  Another question.
[01:16:33.393 --> 01:16:35.474]  How many copies do you think the government owns of your movie?
[01:16:37.614 --> 01:16:47.198]  Anyway, the other thing I do have to ask you is, could you particleize and capitalize a little more about the WWF political tactics that they're using?
[01:16:50.119 --> 01:16:52.320]  You mean how it's basically like a wrestling match?
[01:16:53.020 --> 01:16:53.980]  Sure, sure.
[01:16:54.080 --> 01:16:55.261]  And, you know, particleize it.
[01:16:55.281 --> 01:16:56.461]  Break it down a lot more so that...
[01:16:56.880 --> 01:16:57.840]  I'm not that intelligent.
[01:16:57.860 --> 01:16:58.481]  I'm going to lie to you.
[01:16:58.661 --> 01:17:00.201]  And I know a lot of people around me aren't either.
[01:17:00.482 --> 01:17:01.242]  Oh, that's baloney.
[01:17:01.262 --> 01:17:02.142]  It needs to be broke down.
[01:17:02.342 --> 01:17:02.702]  Seriously.
[01:17:02.923 --> 01:17:04.683]  I think it needs to be broke down for a lot of people.
[01:17:04.703 --> 01:17:05.924]  They need to know what's really going on.
[01:17:07.044 --> 01:17:08.045]  And you do a great job of it.
[01:17:08.165 --> 01:17:09.405]  Let me break it down for you right now.
[01:17:09.465 --> 01:17:09.905]  Anything else?
[01:17:10.426 --> 01:17:10.926]  That'll work.
[01:17:11.046 --> 01:17:12.947]  No, that's pretty much it.
[01:17:13.507 --> 01:17:16.328]  Well, I mentioned at the start of the show I was going to do this, and it's in the stack.
[01:17:16.348 --> 01:17:18.449]  Let me find it during the break, and I'll get to it.
[01:17:19.984 --> 01:17:23.426]  It's like Kerry comes out and attacks Bush, Bush comes out and attacks Kerry.
[01:17:23.806 --> 01:17:26.027]  It's not even political, you know, between the two parties.
[01:17:26.568 --> 01:17:33.191]  It's creating the illusion of a debate between the two parties to centralize the debate within the two-party system.
[01:17:33.571 --> 01:17:39.974]  That way, they control both sides and they always expend all of our political energy inside that controlled paradigm.
[01:17:39.994 --> 01:17:41.375]  They don't want you going outside.
[01:17:42.516 --> 01:17:43.236]  Here's an analogy.
[01:17:43.256 --> 01:17:44.997]  They have a chain of grocery stores in England.
[01:17:45.646 --> 01:17:46.186]  We're good to go.
[01:17:46.206 --> 01:17:46.367]  I think?
[01:18:10.846 --> 01:18:12.086]  They're really both working together.
[01:18:37.759 --> 01:18:38.739]  I know he was rough on you.
[01:18:38.779 --> 01:18:41.880]  Now you can come to me and tell me and everything will be alright.
[01:18:41.900 --> 01:18:43.820]  And that's what they're doing right now.
[01:18:43.840 --> 01:18:48.081]  It's like Fox News attacks Hillary while they're busy actually bankrolling her entire campaign.
[01:18:48.421 --> 01:18:48.881]  Stay with us.
[01:18:48.901 --> 01:18:49.501]  We'll be right back.
[01:18:54.282 --> 01:18:55.422]  Ted Anderson from Midas.
[01:18:55.462 --> 01:18:56.582]  Today is November 1st, 2006.
[01:18:56.622 --> 01:18:58.883]  Gold opened at $614.30 and one ounce gold coins can be purchased for $640.56.
[01:18:58.923 --> 01:19:00.743]  Again, that's $640.56 to purchase one ounce gold coins.
[01:19:07.077 --> 01:19:19.988]  On June 4th, 1963, an unknown presidential decree, Executive Order 11110, was signed with the authority to strip the Federal Reserve Bank of its power to lend money to the United States government and interest.
[01:19:20.468 --> 01:19:23.631]  With the stroke of a pen, Kennedy would have put the Fed out of business.
[01:19:24.171 --> 01:19:27.614]  The November assassination quieted the production of the new currency.
[01:19:27.674 --> 01:19:30.716]  However, the executive order still stands unrepealed.
[01:19:31.137 --> 01:19:33.959]  Midas has the Kennedy versus Fed document.
[01:19:34.199 --> 01:19:34.980]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:19:37.542 --> 01:19:39.804]  Unlike your liberty, the paper is free.
[01:19:40.164 --> 01:19:40.905]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:19:41.065 --> 01:19:47.070]  If you're interested in breaking the bondage of taxation and debt, call 800-686-2237.
[01:19:47.090 --> 01:19:47.270]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:19:55.112 --> 01:19:57.496]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[01:19:57.957 --> 01:20:04.627]  Did you know that an FBI agent assigned to the White House when Bill Clinton took office wrote a book entitled Unlimited Access?
[01:20:05.473 --> 01:20:12.838]  He told of Clinton's staff coming into the White House its first day with red buttons on their shirt with a picture of the first communist dictator, V.I.
[01:20:12.898 --> 01:20:13.578]  Lennon, on them.
[01:20:14.419 --> 01:20:19.122]  Is it any wonder the United States government moved further to the left during the Clinton administration?
[01:20:19.703 --> 01:20:23.705]  Even Hillary tried to pass a socialistic program for health care.
[01:20:24.306 --> 01:20:32.071]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch magazine.
[01:20:32.691 --> 01:20:34.132]  Just call our toll-free number, 1-800.
[01:20:35.453 --> 01:20:35.673]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[01:20:35.693 --> 01:20:36.354]  Call now.
[01:20:36.394 --> 01:20:40.337]  Operators are standing by to receive your call for a free subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[01:20:53.823 --> 01:20:58.905]  Black Berkey purification elements are more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[01:20:58.965 --> 01:21:06.288]  These awesome elements are used in Berkey purification systems, and they can also be used to upgrade most other gravity filtration systems.
[01:21:06.428 --> 01:21:17.052]  They can purify raw, untreated water by removing pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, trihalomethanes, and chemicals such as chlorine, atrazine, styrene, and MTBE.
[01:21:17.272 --> 01:21:21.814]  These elements also reduce unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[01:21:22.094 --> 01:21:27.079]  Unbelievably, they even remove small microparticulate from water like food coloring particles.
[01:21:27.279 --> 01:21:30.221]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:21:30.462 --> 01:21:40.230]  Moreover, because they are recleanable, black Berkey elements are more economical than the standard disposable elements, providing fresh, pure water for less than two cents per gallon.
[01:21:40.350 --> 01:21:41.010]  We're good to go.
[01:22:09.002 --> 01:22:09.542]  We're good to go.
[01:22:31.701 --> 01:22:34.003]  That's The Nationalist Times, PO Box 426, Allison Park, PA 15101.
[01:22:34.123 --> 01:22:35.764]  That's The Nationalist Times, PO Box 426, Allison Park, PA 15101.
[01:22:35.804 --> 01:22:37.565]  Or subscribe online at our website, www.anu.org.
[01:23:09.205 --> 01:23:16.248]  We're getting Larry Pratt off for about 10-15 minutes in the next hour to talk about his A-plus rating of Ron Paul, who's never voted pro-gun control.
[01:23:16.828 --> 01:23:25.872]  The sniveling Democrat who says we should be allowed to have guns for hunting is given an A. Ron Paul is given a B. They're endorsing a Democrat over the Congressman.
[01:23:26.052 --> 01:23:28.193]  Lying scum!
[01:23:28.213 --> 01:23:34.476]  I mean, that is an illustration of everything we're talking about.
[01:23:36.323 --> 01:23:41.926]  And I tell you, if some neocon walks up to me and tells me, you're just a liberal, I'm going to snatch him ball-headed.
[01:23:42.966 --> 01:23:44.527]  I mean, I'm just tired of it.
[01:23:44.647 --> 01:23:46.427]  I'm tired of these Republicans.
[01:23:46.447 --> 01:23:47.988]  They're a bunch of phonies.
[01:23:48.668 --> 01:23:51.710]  And I'm tired of the National Rifle Association.
[01:23:51.770 --> 01:23:53.310]  I'm not talking about you, the members.
[01:23:53.651 --> 01:23:54.871]  I'm talking about what they do.
[01:23:55.171 --> 01:23:55.972]  I've been watching it.
[01:23:56.352 --> 01:23:57.392]  I've been in the trenches.
[01:23:58.213 --> 01:24:00.194]  I've traveled all over the country fighting gun control.
[01:24:00.214 --> 01:24:01.354]  That used to be my number one issue.
[01:24:01.614 --> 01:24:03.375]  It still is one of the top issues I fight.
[01:24:04.904 --> 01:24:15.731]  But, I mean, I've been there, rally after rally at the state capitol, sneaking around the halls of the statehouse with a video camera, catching bribery on tape, sitting in for eight hours to testify.
[01:24:15.751 --> 01:24:20.974]  I just, I cannot explain to you how much I'm committed to the Second Amendment.
[01:24:21.574 --> 01:24:23.836]  And I just, I just, it blows me away.
[01:24:24.924 --> 01:24:27.005]  Cancel all your NRA memberships.
[01:24:27.485 --> 01:24:29.105]  And by the way, we're doing research in there.
[01:24:29.145 --> 01:24:33.367]  They're giving bees to a bunch of pro-gun congressmen and promoting gun grabbers.
[01:24:33.487 --> 01:24:36.688]  I mean, it's just, there's no end to these people's treachery.
[01:24:37.688 --> 01:24:38.908]  We're writing an article about this.
[01:24:38.928 --> 01:24:40.129]  We're making a big issue out of it.
[01:24:40.149 --> 01:24:45.530]  It'll be up by tonight at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com and JonesReport.com.
[01:24:45.851 --> 01:24:50.092]  By the way, JonesReport.com has a lot of news on it and video clips on it every day that aren't on the other sites.
[01:24:50.512 --> 01:24:51.252]  We put a lot of work.
[01:24:51.272 --> 01:24:53.813]  I've got a full-time person working on JonesReport.com and
[01:24:54.582 --> 01:25:00.143]  It's getting a lot of visitors, but not what it should, so you might want to put that in your favorites list if you don't want to miss things.
[01:25:00.163 --> 01:25:14.527]  All right, the caller wanted me to get into the left-right dog and pony smoke and mirrors, carnival barking, good cop, bad cop, WWF distraction, and I just did before the break, so let me get into some other news right now.
[01:25:15.589 --> 01:25:16.490]  Well, I said I'd get into it.
[01:25:16.510 --> 01:25:16.790]  Here it is.
[01:25:17.250 --> 01:25:20.812]  This is out of the AP White House and Kerry exchange accusations.
[01:25:21.292 --> 01:25:39.302]  The White House and Senator John Kerry, who were cousins and related and in the same secret society, traded their harshest accusations since the 2004 presidential race on Tuesday with President Bush accusing a Democrat of troop bashing and Kerry calling the President's men's hacks who were willing to die.
[01:25:40.188 --> 01:25:44.732]  And they want us to have a phony discussion about, well, did what Kerry said, was it mean?
[01:25:45.373 --> 01:25:46.554]  Was it callous?
[01:25:47.855 --> 01:25:49.997]  And I'm going to say something that will make a lot of people mad.
[01:25:50.017 --> 01:25:52.799]  I don't support what Kerry said.
[01:25:53.780 --> 01:26:04.149]  I mean, yes, it's true that a lot of people go into the military because for financial reasons and the GI Bill, which they cheat you out of most of the time, by the way.
[01:26:04.878 --> 01:26:06.599]  You think I'm kidding?
[01:26:06.619 --> 01:26:07.400]  I'm not making any of this up.
[01:26:07.420 --> 01:26:09.942]  You can't make this type of stuff up, and I'm already digressing.
[01:26:33.215 --> 01:26:36.558]  Because it is something, you know, you're not supposed to say things even if it's true.
[01:26:37.358 --> 01:26:40.581]  And there are some people that join for esprit de corps because it's a family tradition.
[01:26:41.121 --> 01:26:43.763]  But the grunts do join by and large for economic reasons.
[01:26:43.823 --> 01:26:46.465]  But who cares what Kerry says?
[01:26:46.525 --> 01:26:48.166]  Who cares what that slimeball says?
[01:26:48.506 --> 01:26:51.348]  And that just makes Bush look good like he's for the military.
[01:26:51.689 --> 01:26:52.849]  It's all staged.
[01:26:52.889 --> 01:26:55.131]  It's all to have a phony political debate.
[01:26:55.852 --> 01:26:57.213]  Kerry voted for the war.
[01:26:57.513 --> 01:27:00.555]  Kerry said put more troops in, just like McCain's saying today.
[01:27:01.420 --> 01:27:02.520]  He's not anti-war.
[01:27:02.600 --> 01:27:04.221]  Hillary wants to nuke Iran.
[01:27:04.641 --> 01:27:08.483]  Again, the New York Post, Murdoch's neocon rag.
[01:27:08.923 --> 01:27:10.323]  Tabloid has endorsed her.
[01:27:10.343 --> 01:27:13.965]  They have fundraisers for secret meetings for five years together.
[01:27:14.405 --> 01:27:15.225]  Vacationing.
[01:27:15.245 --> 01:27:17.086]  The Bushes and the Clintons all vacationing.
[01:27:17.686 --> 01:27:27.110]  George Bush Sr., from inside sources we've got, and now it's even come out in some of the big political treatises that have been written, that Clinton was recruited by U.S.
[01:27:27.150 --> 01:27:27.690]  intelligence.
[01:27:28.506 --> 01:27:33.749]  In 68, when he first became a Rhodes Scholar, and he was handled by George Bush Sr.
[01:27:33.789 --> 01:27:35.430]  before he became CIA director.
[01:27:35.870 --> 01:27:37.271]  It's totally staged.
[01:27:37.391 --> 01:27:46.795]  Roger Ailes that handles Limbaugh and Clear Channel and Fox News, constantly having lavish meals with Hillary for years, fundraising for her.
[01:27:47.956 --> 01:27:50.978]  And I heard the neocons on radio going, well, she's the best we've got.
[01:27:51.018 --> 01:27:52.759]  We should vote for her in New York.
[01:27:53.479 --> 01:27:55.440]  Because she's a neocon warmonger.
[01:27:56.698 --> 01:27:57.278]  There you are.
[01:27:57.338 --> 01:27:58.559]  You're endorsing Hillary.
[01:27:59.360 --> 01:28:03.642]  Republicans, you're attacking Ron Paul with a perfect voting record.
[01:28:03.862 --> 01:28:04.302]  Perfect.
[01:28:04.542 --> 01:28:04.983]  Perfect.
[01:28:05.203 --> 01:28:05.603]  Perfect.
[01:28:05.843 --> 01:28:09.125]  No one in Congress in modern history has been perfect.
[01:28:10.386 --> 01:28:12.327]  Not Tom Tancredo, who they're attacking to.
[01:28:13.027 --> 01:28:13.788]  Not Gould.
[01:28:13.848 --> 01:28:14.448]  Not any of them.
[01:28:14.988 --> 01:28:16.109]  Ron Paul.
[01:28:16.589 --> 01:28:18.630]  Targeted by the Republican and Democratic machine.
[01:28:19.070 --> 01:28:20.491]  Lied about by the NRA.
[01:28:20.891 --> 01:28:21.672]  And in trouble.
[01:28:23.815 --> 01:28:25.156]  Because they're going to steal the election from him.
[01:28:25.476 --> 01:28:30.040]  Polls show 64%, but the neocons are twinkly-eyed, going, he's going to lose.
[01:28:30.200 --> 01:28:32.983]  Our internal special data shows it.
[01:28:33.924 --> 01:28:38.628]  And don't worry, Democrats will click their heels when this creature, squar, gets in there.
[01:28:39.288 --> 01:28:41.850]  Oh, good, another pro-gun person shot down.
[01:28:44.212 --> 01:28:45.113]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.593 --> 01:28:47.215]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:48.135 --> 01:28:50.798]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:54.611 --> 01:28:57.753]  We understand that decisions related to health can be overwhelming.
[01:28:58.013 --> 01:29:04.817]  That is why at ResearchedHerbs.com we take pride in offering you herbs whose safety and effectiveness have been proven time and time again.
[01:29:05.257 --> 01:29:18.605]  For example, did you know that Live 52, the top-selling natural herbal supplement for liver diseases since 1930, is backed by over 300 research studies and clinical trials and prescribed by more than 200,000 health professionals worldwide?
[01:29:18.925 --> 01:29:22.347]  In fact, the effectiveness of all the herbs featured on ResearchedHerbs.com
[01:29:22.978 --> 01:29:24.059]  We're good to go.
[01:29:24.079 --> 01:29:24.339]  I think?
[01:29:53.951 --> 01:29:54.392]  We're good to go.
[01:30:10.666 --> 01:30:11.087]  We're good to go.
[01:30:28.206 --> 01:30:28.626]  We're good to go.
[01:30:28.646 --> 01:30:29.067]  We're good to go.
[01:30:29.087 --> 01:30:29.467]  We're good to go.
[01:30:55.279 --> 01:31:00.700]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network, and I have an urgent message for our listeners.
[01:31:01.120 --> 01:31:05.881]  The mass media keeps telling us that we are the richest, most powerful economy in the world.
[01:31:06.261 --> 01:31:08.882]  If this is true, why can't we pay our bills?
[01:31:09.382 --> 01:31:12.783]  Why is the United States the world's largest debtor nation?
[01:31:13.563 --> 01:31:17.884]  The truth is that we are in the worst debt bubble in our nation's history.
[01:31:18.324 --> 01:31:21.504]  When the bubble bursts, will you be able to feed your family?
[01:31:22.104 --> 01:31:24.945]  When the inevitable crash occurs, will you be ready?
[01:31:25.726 --> 01:31:28.007]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.
[01:31:28.027 --> 01:31:30.748]  That's 1-888-892-6238 for the following two free reports.
[01:31:30.828 --> 01:31:30.888]  U.S.
[01:31:30.948 --> 01:31:32.489]  Debt Bubble Red Alert and Real Estate Crash.
[01:31:32.729 --> 01:31:33.329]  Call 1-888-8XANADU.
[01:31:33.389 --> 01:31:34.130]  That's 1-888-8XANADU.
[01:31:34.170 --> 01:31:34.990]  Ask for George.
[01:32:02.779 --> 01:32:08.144]  He's finishing up another interview right now.
[01:32:08.324 --> 01:32:15.010]  So in the next 30 minutes or so, I'm going to have a quick pop-in by the head honcho at Gunners of America, a real no-compromise Second Amendment group.
[01:32:15.030 --> 01:32:17.932]  You'd call it commie Islamofascist.
[01:32:18.453 --> 01:32:26.640]  That's what the new neocon followers, I mean the Republican people out in the street, they call you, if you're truly pro-gun, truly want to shut down the border, they call you an Islamic neofascist.
[01:32:27.777 --> 01:32:28.918]  Or Islamofascist.
[01:32:28.958 --> 01:32:30.960]  I'm kind of being sarcastic, but really, I'm serious.
[01:32:31.060 --> 01:32:32.461]  I mean, they don't like Ron Paul.
[01:32:32.501 --> 01:32:33.822]  They don't like America.
[01:32:33.862 --> 01:32:34.923]  They hate the Second Amendment.
[01:32:35.744 --> 01:32:37.425]  Bush has tripled the size of the BATF.
[01:32:37.445 --> 01:32:37.826]  They love it.
[01:32:38.166 --> 01:32:42.330]  Let's go to Bett in Germany, then Uri in Netherlands.
[01:32:42.370 --> 01:32:43.631]  Got a lot of foreign calls today.
[01:32:44.211 --> 01:32:45.272]  Bett in Deutschland.
[01:32:45.312 --> 01:32:47.254]  I guess an American calling us from Deutschland.
[01:32:47.714 --> 01:32:48.715]  Deutschland, Deutschland.
[01:32:48.735 --> 01:32:49.756]  Uber Alice, how you doing?
[01:32:51.297 --> 01:32:52.578]  Tip-top, Mr. Jones.
[01:32:52.638 --> 01:32:53.279]  Never better.
[01:32:53.757 --> 01:32:54.918]  I'm a first-time caller.
[01:32:54.958 --> 01:33:02.862]  I've been listening to your show for a couple of years now, but for the last few months, five or six months, I've been listening to it continually.
[01:33:02.882 --> 01:33:06.064]  I have it on a loop on my computer.
[01:33:07.205 --> 01:33:21.833]  The reason is because the information is changing so quickly, and it's so important that it takes me this long to internalize everything and understand what exactly the events that are developing mean.
[01:33:22.785 --> 01:33:35.227]  And what I'm seeing from others that share my vision, so to speak, is that they're not fully appreciating the consequence of the events as they're developing.
[01:33:35.487 --> 01:33:42.849]  Yeah, these are earth-shattering events that 100 years ago people will look back on as the prime events in modern history.
[01:33:42.889 --> 01:33:45.869]  I mean, we're living ultra-history right now.
[01:33:46.929 --> 01:33:49.410]  We're reliving what happened in Nazi Germany.
[01:33:51.084 --> 01:33:51.745]  In my opinion.
[01:33:51.785 --> 01:33:53.166]  Well, a top Nazi agent.
[01:33:53.186 --> 01:33:59.352]  I mean, George Bush's grandfather, his father's father, was the top Nazi agent in the U.S., and they are using those tactics.
[01:33:59.933 --> 01:34:00.594]  Absolutely.
[01:34:01.114 --> 01:34:06.800]  And all the Nazi officers and war criminals didn't all go to South America.
[01:34:07.120 --> 01:34:09.002]  Most of them came to the United States.
[01:34:09.462 --> 01:34:10.724]  Over 10,000 of them.
[01:34:10.744 --> 01:34:12.105]  That's admitted and declassified.
[01:34:12.886 --> 01:34:13.827]  That's quite a few.
[01:34:14.982 --> 01:34:21.265]  Most of them went into universities, federal agencies, were very prominent in the Catholic Church.
[01:34:21.745 --> 01:34:24.686]  And what we're seeing today is the result of their progeny.
[01:34:25.967 --> 01:34:28.768]  And I am very frightened.
[01:34:29.968 --> 01:34:40.012]  So much so that my advice to everyone is, if you have any money, buy Euros and leave the country.
[01:34:40.032 --> 01:34:41.313]  If you're able to.
[01:34:42.253 --> 01:34:43.614]  If you're extremely wealthy,
[01:34:45.012 --> 01:34:48.474]  If you're a millionaire, you probably won't have much to worry about.
[01:34:49.455 --> 01:34:57.899]  But if you have a home, a savings, a halfway decent life, it's going to be gone in the next few years.
[01:35:00.140 --> 01:35:09.325]  That is, I was gulping for air when you said that because I've got two big mainstream stories about that today and every indicator is what you're saying is going to happen and I just can't, it's just horrible.
[01:35:10.043 --> 01:35:12.064]  It's terrible, and it's terrifying.
[01:35:13.804 --> 01:35:14.525]  I live in Germany.
[01:35:14.545 --> 01:35:15.885]  I have a house in North Carolina.
[01:35:16.225 --> 01:35:20.947]  It's rented out right now, but I went back home for about eight months.
[01:35:21.547 --> 01:35:30.590]  I came back in May, and the United States, where I used to live in Chantilly, Northern Virginia, it's a Washington suburb, it's a police state.
[01:35:31.250 --> 01:35:36.572]  It's completely overrun with South American illegal immigrants.
[01:35:37.128 --> 01:35:39.549]  And illegal immigrants from the Middle East.
[01:35:39.869 --> 01:35:44.210]  And cops leaving them all alone, feeding on minivans full of soccer moms.
[01:35:44.910 --> 01:35:45.630]  Absolutely.
[01:35:46.651 --> 01:35:47.451]  Absolutely.
[01:35:47.831 --> 01:35:57.994]  What used to be a community of military and government workers, paraprofessionals, is now illegal immigrants.
[01:35:59.394 --> 01:36:02.755]  Northern Virginia has become a haven to launder money.
[01:36:03.516 --> 01:36:04.956]  There is no professional
[01:36:05.740 --> 01:36:16.104]  Word for us, other than the elite of what's left, because they closed down so many installations and got rid of so many jobs, now they have illegal immigrants there.
[01:36:16.544 --> 01:36:18.624]  Hasn't globalism been wonderful?
[01:36:20.105 --> 01:36:22.246]  It's the death of the United States.
[01:36:22.906 --> 01:36:25.167]  And people are talking about, well, what do you think?
[01:36:25.187 --> 01:36:26.327]  Do you think it'll happen?
[01:36:26.347 --> 01:36:27.287]  Do you think it's coming?
[01:36:27.367 --> 01:36:28.528]  It's too late.
[01:36:29.308 --> 01:36:33.009]  Everything, everything, everything is made up.
[01:36:33.149 --> 01:36:34.950]  I can find nothing anywhere
[01:36:35.789 --> 01:36:39.574]  I have been in stores looking for an hour and find nothing made in the U.S.
[01:36:39.914 --> 01:36:41.757]  Not even the boxes the stuff comes in.
[01:36:42.506 --> 01:36:45.908]  We don't have a manufactured-based economy, Mr. Jones.
[01:36:46.008 --> 01:36:47.728]  We have a service-based economy.
[01:36:47.748 --> 01:36:57.252]  We have a money laundering, drug dealer economy, a criminal police state economy, and all the new major funds and grants that people are getting to go to school.
[01:36:58.153 --> 01:37:02.235]  Almost all of them are for Homeland Security to man and run this system.
[01:37:02.275 --> 01:37:08.297]  The whole economy is shifting into a police state economy that, again, has nothing to do with fighting Al-Qaeda.
[01:37:08.317 --> 01:37:09.678]  It's all about oppressing the people.
[01:37:10.561 --> 01:37:11.221]  Absolutely.
[01:37:11.642 --> 01:37:12.202]  Absolutely.
[01:37:12.242 --> 01:37:18.786]  I took a few administration of justice classes when I was in Northern Virginia to get my GI Bill.
[01:37:18.806 --> 01:37:20.566]  That's an interest I have.
[01:37:21.587 --> 01:37:28.651]  And the only smiling faces on the entire campus came from the English as a second language classroom.
[01:37:30.392 --> 01:37:33.894]  The rest of the student body looks like they're beat down.
[01:37:34.314 --> 01:37:35.434]  Very apathetic.
[01:37:36.535 --> 01:37:38.156]  They're living in their parents' house.
[01:37:38.737 --> 01:37:40.558]  Driving luxury SUVs.
[01:37:40.958 --> 01:37:45.420]  No appreciation for where the money is coming and when it's going to stop.
[01:37:45.520 --> 01:37:50.042]  There's a really obnoxious, racist term for that, but everybody's doing it.
[01:37:50.503 --> 01:37:54.284]  And it's basically, you're living in a shack, but you've got a big color TV and a Cadillac.
[01:37:54.344 --> 01:37:57.326]  And yeah, most of these professionals live with mommy and daddy now.
[01:37:57.986 --> 01:37:58.626]  Absolutely.
[01:37:58.667 --> 01:38:00.988]  The kids are running around worshiping world government.
[01:38:01.028 --> 01:38:02.628]  Yeah, it's all falling apart.
[01:38:03.369 --> 01:38:03.929]  Completely.
[01:38:04.409 --> 01:38:07.331]  And the student body, they're not...
[01:38:08.607 --> 01:38:09.229]  I think you're right.
[01:38:17.930 --> 01:38:19.572]  It has no significance to them.
[01:38:19.592 --> 01:38:22.474]  And short-term thinking will kill a society.
[01:38:22.514 --> 01:38:24.016]  It will kill your pocketbook.
[01:38:24.396 --> 01:38:30.642]  It will destroy your family's happiness and your family being together, period.
[01:38:30.682 --> 01:38:38.910]  We are being scientifically, by social engineers, dismantled, ripped into little pieces right now, and it makes me sick.
[01:38:39.778 --> 01:38:45.200]  They're driving their SUVs and their parents are paying $3 a gallon for the gas.
[01:38:45.220 --> 01:38:46.841]  They just burn it like it's free.
[01:38:46.981 --> 01:38:55.083]  They don't understand that once their parents' jobs are gone and their retirements are gone, they're going to be looking for the bus.
[01:38:55.203 --> 01:38:59.845]  That idea is so foreign to them, they cannot possibly conceptualize it.
[01:39:00.205 --> 01:39:02.186]  And they don't realize how perilously...
[01:39:02.694 --> 01:39:04.055]  Close it is to them.
[01:39:04.255 --> 01:39:08.758]  It's nothing on their hands, and they have no appreciation of it whatsoever.
[01:39:08.959 --> 01:39:10.320]  I hear you, and I appreciate your call.
[01:39:10.360 --> 01:39:11.741]  Your IP phone's breaking up a little bit.
[01:39:12.101 --> 01:39:13.922]  Good to have that call from Germany.
[01:39:14.242 --> 01:39:17.385]  Let me cover this now, and then I'll go to... Who's the caller from the Netherlands?
[01:39:18.405 --> 01:39:20.147]  We'll go to Urien and others here in just a moment.
[01:39:20.187 --> 01:39:22.689]  Let me get into these stories.
[01:39:24.190 --> 01:39:25.771]  Which one do I want to get first?
[01:39:25.831 --> 01:39:30.094]  I had a Money Magazine article, and I had another Forbes article.
[01:39:30.501 --> 01:39:31.561]  I thought I had them in the stack.
[01:39:31.601 --> 01:39:34.342]  I just picked up the stack and it wasn't in the top like I thought.
[01:39:36.503 --> 01:39:37.344]  Darn it, darn it.
[01:39:40.385 --> 01:39:44.986]  This one is a report out of Australia's Sydney Morning Herald.
[01:39:45.166 --> 01:39:47.447]  The dollar's full system meltdown.
[01:39:47.467 --> 01:39:49.208]  The Sydney Morning Herald.
[01:39:50.945 --> 01:40:05.007]  ...is reporting, and they're calling for, quote, Australia's Treasurer Peter Costello has called on East Asia's central banks to telegraph their intentions to diversify out of American investments and ensure an orderly...
[01:40:05.905 --> 01:40:07.146]  It's well over 90-plus trill.
[01:40:07.186 --> 01:40:08.126]  That's been in the...
[01:40:35.583 --> 01:40:39.264]  Well, five years ago, the Dallas Morning News reported 47 trill.
[01:40:40.245 --> 01:40:43.406]  But the real numbers by top economists are 90-plus trill.
[01:40:44.506 --> 01:40:52.449]  The central banks now want to reduce their USD reserves while trying to do so as little damage to their own economies as possible.
[01:40:53.150 --> 01:40:56.031]  That's kind of like trying to remove two Siamese twins who've got the same heart.
[01:40:56.591 --> 01:40:57.471]  That'll be difficult.
[01:40:57.671 --> 01:41:01.833]  It's a sell-off in shoes that will start a stampede for the exits.
[01:41:02.463 --> 01:41:05.764]  There's little hope of an ordinary adjustment, said Costello opines.
[01:41:05.804 --> 01:41:09.625]  That's basically the treasurer in Australia.
[01:41:10.186 --> 01:41:11.906]  That's just false optimism.
[01:41:11.986 --> 01:41:19.429]  When the greenback begins listing, that's when a boat comes over, boys and girls, things will turn helter-skelter quickly.
[01:41:19.509 --> 01:41:23.610]  That's what Joseph Stichlitz said last Friday, former chief economist, World Bank Nobel Prize winner.
[01:41:23.630 --> 01:41:26.451]  And it's all been done by design.
[01:41:27.232 --> 01:41:28.012]  Oh, thank you.
[01:41:28.312 --> 01:41:29.852]  I'm sure it's Elkhart's fault.
[01:41:29.872 --> 01:41:31.293]  I'm sure it'll be Elkhart's fault.
[01:41:32.839 --> 01:41:38.322]  And as long as the police go to public schools and put guns to kids' heads unannounced in drills, we'll be safe.
[01:41:38.563 --> 01:41:40.284]  See, nothing has anything to do with reality.
[01:41:40.324 --> 01:41:41.584]  It's about training us to be slaves.
[01:41:42.485 --> 01:41:45.027]  In September, we saw early signs that the dollar was in trouble.
[01:41:45.387 --> 01:41:54.232]  The trade deficit registered a $70 billion, but the net foreign security purchases, NFSP, came in as a paltry $33 billion.
[01:41:54.633 --> 01:42:00.056]  That means that our main trading partners are no longer buying back our debt, which puts downward pressure on the greenback.
[01:42:00.831 --> 01:42:01.993]  The Fed had two choices.
[01:42:02.393 --> 01:42:05.657]  Either raise interest rates substantively or let the currency fall.
[01:42:05.797 --> 01:42:07.900]  They rose interest rates, but that isn't working.
[01:42:08.220 --> 01:42:14.007]  Given the tenuous condition of the housing bubble and the proximity of the midterm elections, the Fed did neither.
[01:42:14.408 --> 01:42:15.569]  They actually did raise interest rates.
[01:42:15.609 --> 01:42:19.174]  I guess not what you wanted, up to 12% or something from 6 point whatever it is.
[01:42:19.614 --> 01:42:27.519]  A month later, in October, the trade deficit hit $69.9 billion, but then, without warning, a miracle occurred.
[01:42:27.539 --> 01:42:35.984]  The net foreign security purchases skyrocketed to a historic high of $116.8 billion, covering both months' shortfalls almost to the penny.
[01:42:36.044 --> 01:42:36.565]  Coincidence?
[01:42:37.005 --> 01:42:37.625]  Not likely.
[01:42:37.685 --> 01:42:41.768]  Either the skittish central banks decided to stock up on their dollar denomination,
[01:42:42.549 --> 01:42:43.650]  We're good to go.
[01:42:43.670 --> 01:42:44.110]  We're good to go.
[01:42:44.170 --> 01:42:44.690]  We're good to go.
[01:43:05.988 --> 01:43:17.699]  Are we supposed to believe that the skeptical central banks suddenly doubled up on their T-bills while they're publicly moaning about the dollar's weakness and threatening to diversify?
[01:43:17.719 --> 01:43:19.820]  And the article goes on and on.
[01:43:20.641 --> 01:43:28.068]  Here's another one put out by the founder of the Gold Antitrust Action Committee who we've interviewed who's successfully been shooing over central bank gold manipulation.
[01:43:28.820 --> 01:43:29.140]  I think.
[01:43:53.021 --> 01:43:59.923]  For the last seven years, Murphy says, the GATA has pounded the table, insisting that the world gold market is manipulated.
[01:44:00.203 --> 01:44:08.985]  The government leaders, the banking establishment, and their captive financial press have refused to debate the issue, dismissing it as conspiratorial nonsense.
[01:44:09.045 --> 01:44:14.627]  But Murphy contends the GATA has proof of the public record of central bank gold reserves on deposit.
[01:44:15.825 --> 01:44:16.266]  We're good to go.
[01:44:27.521 --> 01:44:37.684]  Murphy sees a convergence coming in the gold market between the rising physical demand for gold and the shrinking mining output supply with the gold price management by central bank's cotton squeeze.
[01:44:38.104 --> 01:44:55.289]  The Wall Street Journal reports Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, a Wall Street veteran and reinvigorated the president's working group on financial markets, PPT, which includes heads of the Fed, SEC, and Commodity Trading Commission, said that gold prices could double to $1,200 per ounce
[01:44:57.069 --> 01:44:59.090]  In the short term, and it continues.
[01:45:01.292 --> 01:45:03.213]  Yeah, if the dollar goes belly up.
[01:45:03.233 --> 01:45:08.756]  They've been trying, as Joseph Stiklitz told you last week, Nobel Prize winner, former chief economist, World Bank, number two at the World Bank.
[01:45:09.356 --> 01:45:17.061]  He said it'll be a worldwide depression if they don't handle the recession, the controlled correction, correctly globally.
[01:45:17.859 --> 01:45:23.722]  And he said that if they did handle it correctly, just a worldwide recession, a huge slowdown, a huge correction.
[01:45:24.182 --> 01:45:26.283]  And I said, well are they handling it correctly?
[01:45:26.323 --> 01:45:28.064]  And he said, absolutely not.
[01:45:28.364 --> 01:45:30.385]  But that's handling it correctly.
[01:45:31.508 --> 01:45:35.389]  When he says that, he agreed according to the Financial Times of London statement.
[01:45:35.649 --> 01:45:42.291]  I asked him, well, they said that the elite's just trying to protect their money, that they're saying it's so bad they may not even be able to do that.
[01:45:42.311 --> 01:45:49.593]  And so the good side, the, quote, control correction or downfall of the dollar, will mean that they are able to reposition their wealth.
[01:45:50.113 --> 01:45:52.574]  On the bad side, it will be a worldwide implosion.
[01:45:53.114 --> 01:45:55.375]  And he said, yes, that's exactly what's going on.
[01:45:56.889 --> 01:45:58.870]  So I'm not trying to give you bad news here.
[01:45:59.030 --> 01:46:09.975]  And maybe they'll just keep printing money forever and double the money supply again and everybody is so tied into the dollar they won't be able to dump it sufficiently without destroying their own economies and so everything will be okay.
[01:46:10.275 --> 01:46:18.779]  The problem is all these big money barons and these central banks can't help themselves because they want to position the wealth so that they don't get completely destroyed in this.
[01:46:19.299 --> 01:46:24.763]  And so the globalists are telling everybody to keep holding on to dollars while they themselves move out of the dollar.
[01:46:24.983 --> 01:46:43.176]  People are now seeing this precipitous move out of the world reserve currency, being the dollar, backed up by petrodollars, that is petrochemicals derived from crude oil, that it is like a Mexican standoff and everybody's starting to get a little trigger happy here and who knows what's going to happen.
[01:46:44.480 --> 01:46:52.325]  Now that's a mouthful, and during the next break I'll try to dig out the Forbes and the Money Magazine articles I have that aren't pretty either.
[01:46:53.166 --> 01:46:59.290]  Let's talk to Lewis in New Jersey, and then we'll go to folks in Germany and Philadelphia and Missouri.
[01:47:00.070 --> 01:47:01.291]  Go ahead, Lewis, you're on the air.
[01:47:03.453 --> 01:47:06.174]  Yes, Alex, this is Lewis calling from New Jersey.
[01:47:07.075 --> 01:47:08.256]  I spoke with you about a week ago.
[01:47:08.991 --> 01:47:27.601]  I wanted to just give a call in and let you know that I had heard your suggestion on the air the other day about sending out messages to senators and city, county, and state officials about net neutrality and everything.
[01:47:27.661 --> 01:47:33.264]  I just wanted to let you know that I did send a message out to my senator here in New Jersey.
[01:47:33.324 --> 01:47:34.685]  He's a rep at Menendez.
[01:47:34.745 --> 01:47:36.486]  He sent a letter back.
[01:47:36.506 --> 01:47:37.006]  He said that...
[01:47:38.393 --> 01:47:55.602]  That he supports the net neutrality, but I gave him a hard copy response and provided some details from an article that I was able to get on Infowars.com about MySpace.com and Rupert Murdoch using that Trojan horse for internet censorship.
[01:47:56.402 --> 01:48:05.787]  And I'm not really sure what his true stance is on the issue, but I just wanted to let you know that I am taking action in that area and plan on also reaching out to
[01:48:06.471 --> 01:48:07.231]  We're good to go.
[01:48:07.251 --> 01:48:07.452]  I think?
[01:48:25.427 --> 01:48:27.589]  Trying to convert some people there as well.
[01:48:27.909 --> 01:48:28.249]  Good.
[01:48:28.329 --> 01:48:31.792]  If we the people take action, we're an unstoppable force.
[01:48:32.453 --> 01:48:45.123]  And if we take action and expose the criminals that run our government as terrorists, if we expose the private federal reserve system with American freedom to fascism, if we take action, all of us, every day, reaching out, we're unstoppable.
[01:48:45.403 --> 01:48:47.125]  In fact, we're already starting to break through.
[01:48:47.145 --> 01:48:49.567]  We're already starting to hit the exponential growth rate.
[01:48:49.967 --> 01:48:51.348]  The truth is burgeoning.
[01:48:51.428 --> 01:48:52.248]  It is exploding.
[01:48:52.588 --> 01:49:03.814]  But we've got to push it even faster because a collision is now taking place between the elite desperately trying to maintain and expand control and the people now getting wise to this one world government system.
[01:49:04.755 --> 01:49:05.595]  Yes, definitely.
[01:49:05.635 --> 01:49:07.036]  I just wanted to add one more thing.
[01:49:07.236 --> 01:49:10.558]  I've been speaking to my dad on a constant basis about this.
[01:49:10.798 --> 01:49:11.698]  He came to the U.S.
[01:49:11.778 --> 01:49:13.099]  actually as a musician.
[01:49:13.679 --> 01:49:17.401]  He was basically brought up here by the mafia.
[01:49:17.421 --> 01:49:17.681]  Not to...
[01:49:19.619 --> 01:49:20.319]  Well, that's good.
[01:49:20.359 --> 01:49:20.860]  Keep it up, my friend.
[01:49:20.880 --> 01:49:25.282]  We'll be right back with more news, more calls, and we've got Gunners of America.
[01:49:47.839 --> 01:49:50.021]  Folks, coming on to talk about what's happening to Ron Paul later.
[01:49:50.041 --> 01:50:02.393]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:50:02.774 --> 01:50:10.381]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:50:11.098 --> 01:50:18.140]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:50:18.540 --> 01:50:29.963]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:50:30.283 --> 01:50:33.804]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:50:34.244 --> 01:50:36.165]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:50:36.505 --> 01:50:40.346]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:50:53.692 --> 01:50:54.473]  Terrorism.
[01:50:54.613 --> 01:50:55.353]  Terrorism.
[01:50:55.453 --> 01:50:56.294]  Chemical attacks.
[01:50:56.374 --> 01:50:57.034]  Dirty bombs.
[01:50:57.134 --> 01:50:57.555]  Fallout.
[01:50:57.635 --> 01:50:58.616]  Biological attack.
[01:50:58.816 --> 01:50:59.336]  Anthrax.
[01:50:59.416 --> 01:51:01.518]  And to top it all off, duct tape and plastic.
[01:51:01.778 --> 01:51:03.379]  Alarming words for our time.
[01:51:03.619 --> 01:51:06.101]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[01:51:06.481 --> 01:51:21.071]  The video, Shiltering in Place, Surviving Acts of Terrorism from Biological, Chemical, and Radioactive Fallout, was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[01:51:21.091 --> 01:51:21.412]  government.
[01:51:21.592 --> 01:51:23.373]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[01:51:23.753 --> 01:51:29.676]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[01:51:29.816 --> 01:51:34.278]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video sheltering in place.
[01:51:34.559 --> 01:51:41.282]  Get the critical information you need now for only $29 plus shipping by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.

[01:51:53.226 --> 01:52:01.174]  For years, you've been hearing about Herbal Healer Academy and how it's remained the leader in effective alternative and natural medicine and education.
[01:52:01.634 --> 01:52:04.797]  But how can they continue to hold that title for years on end?
[01:52:05.177 --> 01:52:08.220]  The answer is high quality and huge selection.
[01:52:08.601 --> 01:52:13.425]  Just visit HerbalHealer.com and shop online or request a free catalog.
[01:52:13.866 --> 01:52:16.208]  You're bound to find the alternative you're looking for.
[01:52:16.937 --> 01:52:21.601]  Did you know that Herbal Healer carries the latest, safest and effective weight loss products?
[01:52:22.121 --> 01:52:27.985]  You can also count on Herbal Healer for the largest selection of safe and natural supplements just for children.
[01:52:28.306 --> 01:52:29.446]  And don't forget your pets.
[01:52:29.927 --> 01:52:35.591]  Herbal Healer even has natural mineral supplements for all your animals, including horses, cows and birds.
[01:52:36.078 --> 01:52:36.598]  We're good to go.
[01:53:18.294 --> 01:53:26.380]  Welcome back.
[01:53:28.481 --> 01:53:30.122]  Almost late getting back in the studio here.
[01:53:30.143 --> 01:53:31.984]  I was just talking to Ron Paul's office.
[01:53:33.585 --> 01:53:34.325]  Penny over there.
[01:53:34.345 --> 01:53:39.149]  And I've also talked to Jeff Dice, his chief of staff.
[01:53:40.231 --> 01:53:41.431]  And yes, they're aware of it.
[01:53:41.471 --> 01:53:43.612]  It's hurting them, and the NRA has lied.
[01:53:44.292 --> 01:53:54.435]  Ron Paul, Nancy Pelosi added a rider onto a gun liability law that would force gun locks to be on all guns.
[01:53:55.556 --> 01:53:56.856]  Basically, it's like the California law.
[01:53:56.876 --> 01:53:59.717]  Then they raid your house and see if your gun's locked up with a lock.
[01:54:00.317 --> 01:54:01.357]  And so he voted against it.
[01:54:01.457 --> 01:54:07.439]  And they're calling, because Ron Paul voted against gun locks, they have given him a B rating and given that little sniveling creature...
[01:54:08.166 --> 01:54:11.808]  That Democrat that he's running against, that gun grabber, AA.
[01:54:13.168 --> 01:54:13.689]  AA.
[01:54:14.869 --> 01:54:17.570]  And we just found out what he did on the questionnaire to the NRA.
[01:54:17.851 --> 01:54:21.872]  He said he believes in guns for hunting, but that there should be sensible controls.
[01:54:21.892 --> 01:54:22.513]  You know what that means.
[01:54:22.533 --> 01:54:23.233]  Total gun ban.
[01:54:24.494 --> 01:54:25.654]  So this is how they twist it.
[01:54:25.694 --> 01:54:27.175]  And this is going on all over the country.
[01:54:28.701 --> 01:54:31.743]  I don't care if you're a Republican, a Democrat, a Libertarian, an Easter Bunny.
[01:54:32.223 --> 01:54:41.648]  If you are for the Second Amendment and controlling our destiny and having sovereignty and shutting down our borders and kicking out the Federal Reserve, I am for you.
[01:54:42.809 --> 01:54:47.872]  By the way, I'm just, again, just frothing with anger right now.
[01:54:49.453 --> 01:54:51.394]  We do have Larry Pratt joining us in the next hour.
[01:54:51.454 --> 01:54:53.195]  We'll go to your calls as well, all of you that are holding.
[01:54:53.695 --> 01:54:56.177]  I'm about to go to a caller in the Netherlands.
[01:54:58.693 --> 01:55:03.856]  But we're also fighting the big issue of Terror Storm being censored in Barnes & Noble and Borders and everywhere else.
[01:55:03.876 --> 01:55:05.977]  They bought them, they have them, and they're not putting them on the shelves.
[01:55:06.997 --> 01:55:10.819]  We have the confirmed receipts that they have them, and they're not even allowing them out on the shelves to be sold.
[01:55:11.539 --> 01:55:12.240]  And this has happened.
[01:55:12.260 --> 01:55:14.981]  Sometimes stuff slips through, they get it, and they just won't sell it.
[01:55:15.521 --> 01:55:17.122]  So we've caught them now in major censorship.
[01:55:17.142 --> 01:55:18.322]  I have to do a big report on this.
[01:55:20.363 --> 01:55:21.424]  It's just massive.
[01:55:23.118 --> 01:55:24.579]  So please go to Amazon.com.
[01:55:24.599 --> 01:55:27.780]  We have big links on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:55:27.820 --> 01:55:30.262]  Please go there right now and buy a copy of it for $12.
[01:55:31.222 --> 01:55:32.723]  It's so discounted, it's ridiculous.
[01:55:33.483 --> 01:55:34.424]  Buy a bunch of copies.
[01:55:34.464 --> 01:55:35.504]  Give it to everybody you know.
[01:55:38.086 --> 01:55:39.066]  Make copies of it.
[01:55:39.186 --> 01:55:39.606]  Whatever.
[01:55:39.826 --> 01:55:40.427]  Just please.
[01:55:40.747 --> 01:55:44.169]  Or order via Infowars.com or get America, Freedom, and Fascism.
[01:55:44.189 --> 01:55:45.309]  Not available yet on Amazon.
[01:55:45.329 --> 01:55:47.910]  You can get it at Infowars.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[01:55:52.171 --> 01:55:53.673]  Let's go to the caller in Netherlands.
[01:55:53.873 --> 01:55:54.854]  How do I pronounce your name?
[01:55:54.914 --> 01:55:55.875]  I'm a dumb Texan.
[01:55:56.896 --> 01:55:57.236]  Urien.
[01:55:57.637 --> 01:55:58.378]  Urien, welcome!
[01:55:58.918 --> 01:56:00.119]  Yes, thank you very much, Alex.
[01:56:00.440 --> 01:56:01.661]  Thank you for taking my call, also.
[01:56:02.141 --> 01:56:05.885]  I'm a first-time caller, and you've waken me up, of course.
[01:56:06.706 --> 01:56:12.192]  And, you know, friends of mine ask, is this fight relevant to us Dutch folk?
[01:56:13.075 --> 01:56:17.318]  And I think it's very relevant because it's global and it should be a concern, a serious concern to all of us.
[01:56:17.338 --> 01:56:22.762]  You're inside the European Union, grabbing your roads, taking control of your families, destroying your currencies.
[01:56:24.183 --> 01:56:24.903]  Well, that's it.
[01:56:25.043 --> 01:56:26.304]  I mean, it's just everywhere.
[01:56:26.444 --> 01:56:27.345]  Everyone is everywhere.
[01:56:27.425 --> 01:56:33.529]  Like you just said, people from Europe are in America doing military work.
[01:56:33.910 --> 01:56:34.690]  I mean, it's crazy.
[01:56:35.371 --> 01:56:39.293]  And the best time we had in Holland was when we were a republic, and that was back in the 17th century.
[01:56:41.492 --> 01:56:47.740]  Yeah, Holland was rivaling England as a world power back when you were a sovereign nation.
[01:56:48.321 --> 01:56:49.062]  Exactly, that's it.
[01:56:49.362 --> 01:56:54.769]  And, well, actually I'm now in the process of writing a book about Queen Beatrix, of all people.
[01:56:55.429 --> 01:57:00.796]  You know, this she-wolf and her family and their role inside the New World Order.
[01:57:01.656 --> 01:57:07.440]  And you're already repeatedly and accurately pointing out that this kind of corporate power is kept within the family.
[01:57:07.460 --> 01:57:08.541]  Yeah, stay there.
[01:57:08.581 --> 01:57:12.083]  In fact, their wealth is secret, is it not?
[01:57:12.683 --> 01:57:13.104]  It is.
[01:57:13.264 --> 01:57:15.065]  It's an official Dutch state secret.
[01:57:16.366 --> 01:57:21.790]  And of course, they're basically, well, they are first cousins of the British royal family.
[01:57:22.450 --> 01:57:23.010]  Stay there.
[01:57:23.050 --> 01:57:28.054]  We'll be right back and let our caller finish up from the Netherlands.
[01:57:29.154 --> 01:57:31.336]  And then we'll go to Larry Pratt.
[01:57:34.116 --> 01:57:34.976]  More than... Big Brother.
[01:57:51.391 --> 01:57:58.237]  All right, Larry Pratt on short notice, very busy right now during this election, the only...
[01:58:14.594 --> 01:58:18.075]  National, real, pro-Second Amendment organization.
[01:58:18.636 --> 01:58:20.656]  I mean, Jews Preservation Farms is great.
[01:58:20.696 --> 01:58:21.817]  It's just not in D.C.
[01:58:21.857 --> 01:58:22.597]  It's in Wisconsin.
[01:58:22.637 --> 01:58:24.378]  It's not as big and as powerful.
[01:58:25.038 --> 01:58:26.098]  But we love them as well.
[01:58:26.819 --> 01:58:29.820]  But it basically orbits what Gun Owners is doing.
[01:58:30.060 --> 01:58:33.081]  They've given Ron Paul and A+, the sniveling NRA...
[01:58:33.802 --> 01:58:40.797]  Has given a sniveling Democrat a wet behind the ears little pup who's for the tracker chips and all the animals.
[01:58:40.857 --> 01:58:41.799]  He's from Big Agra.
[01:58:42.300 --> 01:58:44.305]  He poses with a shotgun on his website.
[01:58:44.958 --> 01:58:47.238]  He's an anti-gunner from all the evidence we've got.
[01:58:47.419 --> 01:58:53.600]  NRA's giving Ron Paul a B, giving him an A, and is endorsing him, and they're using it against him all over the state.
[01:58:53.620 --> 01:58:54.360]  I just learned this.
[01:58:54.800 --> 01:58:56.320]  Supposedly everybody knew it but me.
[01:58:56.740 --> 01:59:02.141]  We had some folks at a meeting last night who were from Paul's district, and they say that Schnibbler is running around.
[01:59:02.161 --> 01:59:05.722]  And I called Ron Paul's office, and he confirmed... I don't even want to say his name.
[01:59:07.102 --> 01:59:08.823]  But... What is it?
[01:59:08.943 --> 01:59:09.463]  Scammer?
[01:59:09.583 --> 01:59:10.023]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:59:10.043 --> 01:59:10.543]  It's something else.
[01:59:10.563 --> 01:59:13.604]  But we're going to have Larry Pratt come in on the next segment.
[01:59:13.884 --> 01:59:14.364]  Right now...
[01:59:15.422 --> 01:59:21.968]  Urien in the Netherlands was talking about Queen Beatrix and how evil she is and how her daddy was the big Nazi, founder of the Bilderberg Group.
[01:59:22.288 --> 01:59:25.130]  We videotaped her at the Bilderberg meeting earlier this year.
[01:59:25.831 --> 01:59:29.674]  They're openly calling for world gun control, world government, world taxes.
[01:59:30.095 --> 01:59:31.816]  We've got about a minute or two minutes left.
[01:59:31.856 --> 01:59:33.177]  Go ahead and finish up what you were saying, sir.
[01:59:33.197 --> 01:59:34.458]  All right, thanks a lot.
[01:59:35.199 --> 01:59:43.646]  Well, the book we're writing is actually about the rise of this family in the Netherlands and how they set up these multinational corporations throughout the last couple of centuries, actually.
[01:59:44.321 --> 01:59:51.267]  And in the 17th century, they invested in and profited from the slave trade, actually, which was a huge whitewash operation.
[01:59:51.387 --> 01:59:53.488]  I mean, selling slaves for products and vice versa.
[01:59:53.628 --> 01:59:54.149]  Oh, yeah.
[01:59:54.169 --> 01:59:57.912]  The Dutch East India Company was, again, rivaled the British East India.
[01:59:58.452 --> 01:59:59.093]  Yeah.
[01:59:59.253 --> 01:59:59.813]  I mean, that's it.
[01:59:59.913 --> 02:00:05.638]  And we set up these big corporations, these big seafaring corporations, which were not governmental.
[02:00:05.698 --> 02:00:07.619]  They were corporations, actually, back then.
[02:00:08.420 --> 02:00:10.742]  And you were talking about... And her wealth is a state secret.
[02:00:11.437 --> 02:00:12.078]  That's it.
[02:00:12.178 --> 02:00:13.779]  It's an official Dutch state secret.
[02:00:13.939 --> 02:00:22.567]  And it's not surprising how we know that they also provided these coffin ships you talked about yesterday, which transported and traded people for profits.
[02:00:22.627 --> 02:00:24.548]  And I'm talking huge profits here.
[02:00:25.129 --> 02:00:28.572]  And up to this day, they're into these big money-making whitewash operations.
[02:00:29.540 --> 02:00:30.741]  I mean, till this day.
[02:00:31.001 --> 02:00:32.642]  Well, when your book comes out, I want to see it.
[02:00:32.682 --> 02:00:38.687]  Yes, some say that the Dutch royal family married in, of course, to the Saxe-Coburg-Gotha British family that's really German.
[02:00:39.327 --> 02:00:41.989]  It may be more wealthy than the British arm.
[02:00:43.190 --> 02:00:55.439]  Probably, because according to the Forbes website, and they put out a report in which they list famous people and how much they make, and Beatrix actually owns, and this is what we know about, $4.7 billion.
[02:00:56.499 --> 02:00:56.820]  Private.
[02:00:56.920 --> 02:00:57.380]  Private-owned.
[02:00:58.716 --> 02:01:04.940]  Well, the Queen owns huge cruise ship lines, huge tanker lines.
[02:01:05.580 --> 02:01:08.702]  She owns a large portion of Dutch Royal Shells.
[02:01:09.182 --> 02:01:10.022]  Just everything.
[02:01:10.082 --> 02:01:12.004]  I mean, it's just, forget billions.
[02:01:12.164 --> 02:01:14.765]  These people are just... Yeah, it's pretty sick.
[02:01:14.785 --> 02:01:19.468]  I mean, we've got to bring the Bilderberg criminals down, you know, one by one, because their members are from everywhere.
[02:01:20.148 --> 02:01:25.051]  And, you know, like me, and everybody who knows anything about these guys should use their research.
[02:01:25.171 --> 02:01:27.352]  And we must deconstruct what these guys have constructed.
[02:01:27.779 --> 02:01:31.281]  And we can take them down, one by one, and we've got to do it with surgical precision, I'm sorry.
[02:01:31.341 --> 02:01:37.824]  And there's all this propaganda over there in the Netherlands about how she rides her bike and she's nice.
[02:01:38.064 --> 02:01:39.204]  Oh, she's so nice, yeah.
[02:01:39.384 --> 02:01:40.705]  Oh, man, it's incredible.
[02:01:40.745 --> 02:01:47.188]  The Dutch media being completely dumbed down and an obedient servant, a lackey, so to speak, simply keeps its mouth shut when it comes to the royal family.
[02:01:47.248 --> 02:01:53.671]  I mean, the family wealth is an official Dutch faith secret, as you know, but our lives of crime are part of the public record, I mean, and we've got to bring them down.
[02:01:54.904 --> 02:01:58.569]  Well, they have brought down European sovereignty, though you're fighting back.
[02:01:58.909 --> 02:02:00.771]  They are behind the North American Union.
[02:02:00.831 --> 02:02:01.712]  I mean, that's admitted.
[02:02:01.732 --> 02:02:04.536]  And these are the people killing our countries.
[02:02:04.936 --> 02:02:05.898]  And they're parasites.
[02:02:05.918 --> 02:02:08.801]  Yeah, man, I got a lot of trouble with that.
[02:02:08.821 --> 02:02:11.985]  So I'm writing this book, and I do it with research, good research.
[02:02:12.285 --> 02:02:13.287]  It's all got to be facts.
[02:02:13.367 --> 02:02:13.927]  It's all facts.
[02:02:14.801 --> 02:02:17.382]  Well, you better be careful with these type of criminals out there.
[02:02:17.442 --> 02:02:18.262]  Thanks for coming on.
[02:02:18.622 --> 02:02:20.142]  And call back again, my friend.
[02:02:20.742 --> 02:02:21.082]  Oh, I will.
[02:02:21.122 --> 02:02:21.662]  Thank you very much.
[02:02:21.802 --> 02:02:22.022]  You bet.
[02:02:22.042 --> 02:02:23.423]  When your book comes out, send me a copy.
[02:02:23.443 --> 02:02:24.583]  We'll probably have you on as a guest.
[02:02:24.903 --> 02:02:26.843]  Yeah, I'll translate it for you and I'll have it out to you.
[02:02:26.863 --> 02:02:27.984]  You know, it's great.
[02:02:28.244 --> 02:02:28.564]  You bet.
[02:02:28.584 --> 02:02:28.964]  Thank you.
[02:02:29.904 --> 02:02:32.445]  Yeah, it's just this Nazi thing just keeps coming up.
[02:02:32.545 --> 02:02:35.205]  And the Dutch royal family were top Nazis.
[02:02:35.705 --> 02:02:36.585]  They are Nazis.
[02:02:36.765 --> 02:02:38.366]  And they are some of the richest people in the world.
[02:02:39.886 --> 02:02:41.706]  Their public wealth, you know, puts them in the top 20.
[02:02:41.806 --> 02:02:42.787]  We'll be right back.
[02:02:48.949 --> 02:02:52.131]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[02:02:52.471 --> 02:02:54.393]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[02:02:54.793 --> 02:03:02.458]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:03:03.138 --> 02:03:10.183]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:03:10.583 --> 02:03:13.525]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran.
[02:03:13.906 --> 02:03:16.227]  A White House program to disseminate fake news.
[02:03:16.647 --> 02:03:17.508]  NSA spying.
[02:03:18.038 --> 02:03:19.338]  Or by calling toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[02:03:19.398 --> 02:03:21.299]  Or watch it right now online at prisonplanet.tv.
[02:03:46.536 --> 02:03:47.497]  Good morning, honey.
[02:03:47.857 --> 02:03:53.864]  Wow, the weather is beautiful, the cabin is terrific, and it's the first day of our vacation.
[02:03:54.144 --> 02:03:54.745]  Yeah.
[02:03:55.145 --> 02:03:56.546]  Honey, is there something wrong?
[02:03:56.907 --> 02:04:00.310]  Yeah, I just realized we forgot to pack the travel burkey system.
[02:04:00.791 --> 02:04:02.272]  I can't drink this cabin water.
[02:04:02.733 --> 02:04:04.434]  And what am I going to do when I'm out on the lake?
[02:04:04.815 --> 02:04:06.597]  Now the whole vacation is ruined.
[02:04:06.797 --> 02:04:07.658]  Honey, cheer up.
[02:04:08.058 --> 02:04:10.320]  I brought our Sport Berkey purifiers.
[02:04:10.581 --> 02:04:10.901]  What?
[02:04:11.321 --> 02:04:21.811]  Yeah, I know you're picky about not having pathogenic bacteria, organic chemicals, heavy metals or foul tastes and odors in the water, so I packed our Sport Berkey purifiers.
[02:04:22.091 --> 02:04:26.936]  You know, this is a terrific cabin, and wow, have you noticed the beautiful weather?
[02:04:27.256 --> 02:04:28.437]  Don't ruin your vacation.
[02:04:28.537 --> 02:04:32.920]  Get a Travel Berkey today for only $209 or get a Sport Berkey for only $39.
[02:04:33.901 --> 02:04:35.922]  Call 888-803-4438.
[02:04:36.543 --> 02:04:42.527]  That's 888-803-4438 or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[02:04:42.607 --> 02:04:44.289]  Travel Berkey not available in Iowa.
[02:04:45.429 --> 02:04:51.434]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism, but globalism.
[02:04:51.994 --> 02:04:52.995]  Globalists are concerned
[02:04:59.906 --> 02:05:00.627]  We're good to go.
[02:05:15.538 --> 02:05:17.458]  The Nationalist Times, PO Box 426, Allison Park, PA 15101.
[02:05:17.538 --> 02:05:19.479]  Or subscribe online at our website, www.anu.org.
[02:05:47.026 --> 02:05:53.052]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:05:53.652 --> 02:05:56.695]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:59.217 --> 02:06:05.283]  No matter where you live, whether it's the Netherlands or California or Canada, Japan, this affects you.
[02:06:07.122 --> 02:06:08.262]  This is an illustration.
[02:06:08.843 --> 02:06:12.604]  This is an example of how our political system is manipulated.
[02:06:12.624 --> 02:06:18.206]  You have Congressman Ron Paul with the strongest pro-gun voting record in congressional history.
[02:06:18.926 --> 02:06:21.908]  Gun owners of America rates him A+, continually.
[02:06:22.568 --> 02:06:24.389]  JPFO rates him A+.
[02:06:24.569 --> 02:06:26.449]  The John Birch Society rates him A+.
[02:06:27.430 --> 02:06:29.590]  He is a congressman from here in Texas.
[02:06:29.631 --> 02:06:31.371]  He was in in the 70s, and they ran him out.
[02:06:31.391 --> 02:06:33.332]  He's gotten back in now for, what, four terms.
[02:06:34.631 --> 02:06:39.532]  He's got legislation to abolish the Federal Reserve, to get us out of Iraq, to abolish all gun laws.
[02:06:39.592 --> 02:06:40.792]  He's an absolute treasure.
[02:06:41.312 --> 02:06:44.093]  They're running this little sniveling anti-gun Democrat.
[02:06:44.133 --> 02:06:46.273]  By the way, Ron Paul's office is sending us records of that.
[02:06:47.313 --> 02:06:48.334]  I just talked to Larry Pratt.
[02:06:48.354 --> 02:06:49.314]  We're about to go to him.
[02:06:49.794 --> 02:07:00.256]  The sniveler that Ron Paul's running against, and Ron Paul's in danger of being beat by, by the way, right now, because of the lies, would not fill out the questionnaire for Gun Owners of America, a sure sign.
[02:07:00.296 --> 02:07:01.436]  He's a Democrat to begin with.
[02:07:02.441 --> 02:07:04.941]  And the Republicans always are going against Ron Paul.
[02:07:04.981 --> 02:07:08.462]  The NRA's been sniping at him for years because they're establishment.
[02:07:10.022 --> 02:07:19.444]  And the NRA has given Ron Paul a B and given the person he's running against, I don't even want to mention his name, an A and endorsed him.
[02:07:21.224 --> 02:07:21.965]  And that's being used.
[02:07:22.005 --> 02:07:23.505]  He's using it all over the district.
[02:07:24.205 --> 02:07:25.625]  They've rewritten Paul's district.
[02:07:26.065 --> 02:07:29.906]  And again, he had a chance to win, but people are hearing, hey, he's an anti-gun Republican.
[02:07:30.837 --> 02:07:31.077]  I think?
[02:07:53.422 --> 02:07:57.764]  Larry Pratt, Gunners of America, thank you so much for coming on with us.
[02:07:57.784 --> 02:07:59.044]  First, tell us who Ron Paul is.
[02:07:59.064 --> 02:08:02.306]  Tell me that story you were telling me during the break about what happened with the D.C.
[02:08:02.346 --> 02:08:04.667]  gun ban, that Ron Paul was the lone person fighting.
[02:08:05.147 --> 02:08:06.388]  The NRA didn't like that.
[02:08:06.868 --> 02:08:08.989]  And then walk us through what we're facing today.
[02:08:09.269 --> 02:08:12.911]  Well, first of all, let me thank you for spotlighting what is going on down there.
[02:08:13.311 --> 02:08:17.673]  I myself am just learning about this, and I'm absolutely shocked.
[02:08:18.466 --> 02:08:27.132]  Back in 1976, Ron Paul had gotten elected to his first set of terms in the Congress, in the House of Representatives, and D.C.
[02:08:27.413 --> 02:08:32.116]  government had put in this gun ban, which, of course, has been a great success.
[02:08:32.196 --> 02:08:45.525]  It's driven him up to the top of the charts for murder rate of all jurisdictions in the country, and he wanted to use the then one-house veto as a way of overturning it.
[02:08:45.605 --> 02:08:47.647]  Congress has the constitutional authority
[02:08:48.442 --> 02:08:51.264]  For whatever happens in the District of Columbia.
[02:08:51.284 --> 02:09:01.190]  They've delegated to the city council that they can and must, if they think that that's what's constitutional, do something to countermand what the D.C.
[02:09:01.250 --> 02:09:02.251]  government has done.
[02:09:02.611 --> 02:09:04.472]  And so that's what Paul was going to do in 76.
[02:09:05.473 --> 02:09:12.518]  And Gun Owners of America had just been organized, so we really didn't have the clout then that we do now.
[02:09:13.138 --> 02:09:16.100]  And in talking to the NRA to try to get them to
[02:09:16.896 --> 02:09:23.359]  Get behind what Paul was doing, the head of their political operation, the newly formed Institute for Legislative Action.
[02:09:23.379 --> 02:09:27.461]  So we're not going to waste any of our political capital on Ron Paul.
[02:09:28.802 --> 02:09:30.283]  We'll just take care of it in the courts.
[02:09:31.023 --> 02:09:32.604]  And so they've always been after him.
[02:09:32.624 --> 02:09:41.808]  And going back two years ago, what really hurt the NRA and finally got some new management we thought was better, we hoped, I had you on then, we read their closing arguments in a D.C.
[02:09:41.848 --> 02:09:43.389]  case that would have overturned the gun ban.
[02:09:43.749 --> 02:09:44.129]  We're good to go.
[02:10:08.647 --> 02:10:18.816]  Well, I think it's clear that the NRA has decided to oppose Paul because he opposed the trigger lock amendment that was put on a lawsuit bill.
[02:10:19.777 --> 02:10:27.779]  And the trigger lock language says that dealers must sell a trigger lock to anybody buying a new or any gun from them.
[02:10:27.979 --> 02:10:33.181]  And the next step is the California-style law where it has to always be on it in your house, and then they do SWAT team raids to check.
[02:10:33.661 --> 02:10:41.783]  Or, and or, these are not mutually exclusive hypotheses, the next step might be lawsuits saying that, well, we sold it to you.
[02:10:41.843 --> 02:10:42.843]  You mean you didn't use it?
[02:10:42.903 --> 02:10:44.704]  Well, you're irresponsible.
[02:10:44.764 --> 02:10:48.585]  You're liable for what that criminal did, not you, you know, not the criminal.
[02:10:49.385 --> 02:10:50.726]  And there have been lawsuits like that.
[02:10:51.066 --> 02:10:51.667]  Oh, yes.
[02:10:51.727 --> 02:10:53.548]  Launched by Pataki and other creatures.
[02:10:53.668 --> 02:11:03.894]  In fact, since the passage of the lawsuit bill, we were concerned that there was language in there that pretty much was going to let existing lawsuits continue.
[02:11:04.834 --> 02:11:09.477]  That was deemed necessary to get the lowest common denominator of the Democrats to go along with it.
[02:11:09.917 --> 02:11:15.881]  Well, it turns out now there are three lawsuits in three different states that have been given the go-ahead by courts today.
[02:11:16.101 --> 02:11:18.402]  To continue against manufacturers.
[02:11:18.622 --> 02:11:25.805]  Yeah, and so by the way, Ron Paul was right on that, and it was the NRA that put that poison pill in the legislation.
[02:11:26.326 --> 02:11:28.887]  He was absolutely right, and frankly...
[02:11:30.595 --> 02:11:37.739]  This could still come up after the elections in a lame duck session, which they are going to have.
[02:11:38.299 --> 02:11:42.201]  Carolyn McCarthy wanted to add a billion bucks to the U.S.
[02:11:42.261 --> 02:11:47.845]  budget in order for states to shovel in more names of more people that would not be allowed to own a gun.
[02:11:48.365 --> 02:11:54.331]  For more, quote, education programs, billboards showing a picture of a revolver saying, Report illegal guns.
[02:11:54.591 --> 02:11:57.354]  Then idiots call the police on their neighbor thinking guns were illegal.
[02:11:57.674 --> 02:12:03.240]  I had a carpet cleaner at my house like six years ago who wanted to call the police on me because of a shotgun in a case.
[02:12:03.841 --> 02:12:05.482]  I mean, it's just total brainwashing.
[02:12:05.662 --> 02:12:12.169]  Well, this was a bill that they were backing, and they actually told some of the media that they were backing it.
[02:12:12.837 --> 02:12:16.938]  And it was by the grace of God that our members were able to make enough noise.
[02:12:16.978 --> 02:12:23.860]  They got on their emails that we sent them and the postcards that we sent them for certain committee members during the recess.
[02:12:24.380 --> 02:12:32.923]  And it made enough noise and they had so little time before the elections that they decided not to, at least at that time, try to put it forth.
[02:12:33.363 --> 02:12:55.348]  But I'm a little concerned about what could happen after the election, and I hope folks will go to gunowners.org, and there's a free email service they can sign up for and become a member of that alert team, alert list, and if they'll just sign up for that, it's free, and they'll find out about this and other things that might be happening even after the elections.
[02:12:55.388 --> 02:12:56.408]  Now, let's be clear, though.
[02:12:56.428 --> 02:12:58.869]  He's running against a sniveling creature, Squawr,
[02:13:00.090 --> 02:13:02.591]  Who is a Democrat who is not pro-gun.
[02:13:02.872 --> 02:13:04.773]  He wouldn't fill out your questionnaire, would he?
[02:13:05.033 --> 02:13:05.634]  No, he would not.
[02:13:06.074 --> 02:13:07.435]  And we sent it to everybody.
[02:13:07.515 --> 02:13:12.238]  We get the addresses that these candidates file with the Secretary of State of their states.
[02:13:12.719 --> 02:13:15.841]  So we knew that we were sending it to a correct address.
[02:13:16.301 --> 02:13:25.067]  Otherwise, the guy wouldn't even get on the ballot because they don't get their return receipt acknowledgement if they don't have a valid address.
[02:13:25.287 --> 02:13:33.773]  He also works for the big Animal ID crowd, which is wildly unpopular and unconstitutional and destroy small farm and ranch agriculture.
[02:13:34.353 --> 02:13:36.957]  And they're saying right now he may be Ron Paul.
[02:13:37.258 --> 02:13:39.801]  I mean, this is insane.
[02:13:39.821 --> 02:13:41.423]  I have it from Ron Paul's office.
[02:13:41.443 --> 02:13:43.146]  What I was told by people last night is true.
[02:13:43.446 --> 02:13:46.270]  He is actively campaigning that Ron Paul is anti-gun.
[02:13:46.671 --> 02:13:47.292]  Is that true?
[02:13:47.832 --> 02:13:49.655]  That is an absolute lie.
[02:13:50.536 --> 02:13:51.096]  He's been fighting!
[02:14:11.121 --> 02:14:13.244]  One of the few members of Congress...
[02:14:22.915 --> 02:14:37.103]  Who not only believes, I think many believe that gun laws should be overturned, but he's actually been the one willing to put out the legislation and to force votes on it when a lot of the leadership, oh come on Paul, there you go again.
[02:14:37.123 --> 02:14:43.527]  And he does it anyway because he didn't get elected to be popular with the leadership in the Congress.
[02:14:43.887 --> 02:14:47.249]  He got elected to represent his districts and to be faithful to his oath of office.
[02:14:48.058 --> 02:14:54.623]  We've got a call into the NRA right now, but from their website it appears that Shane Scaler is listed in their political victory fund.
[02:14:54.663 --> 02:14:55.724]  They may even be funding him.
[02:14:57.466 --> 02:14:59.587]  That's just beyond the pale.
[02:15:00.909 --> 02:15:10.296]  I wish I had Ron Paul's web address, but anybody that can go on the web, just do a search, find out Ron Paul for Congress, and make a donation.
[02:15:10.396 --> 02:15:11.037]  Go right there.
[02:15:11.097 --> 02:15:11.177]  I'm
[02:15:12.227 --> 02:15:14.728]  I'm sure he's got an electronic donation capability.
[02:15:15.809 --> 02:15:18.650]  If you don't want to do that, I'm sure they'll take a credit card over the phone.
[02:15:19.010 --> 02:15:19.390]  Whatever.
[02:15:19.690 --> 02:15:20.751]  This is the time to do it.
[02:15:21.171 --> 02:15:22.371]  Let's get behind this man.
[02:15:22.672 --> 02:15:26.093]  He's been behind us and in front for so many years.
[02:15:26.113 --> 02:15:28.514]  But it shows they can't win by telling the truth.
[02:15:28.854 --> 02:15:29.714]  Isn't that amazing?
[02:15:31.687 --> 02:15:33.288]  I just can't believe the NRA did this.
[02:15:33.368 --> 02:15:34.949]  Is there any way to get them to change the rating?
[02:15:35.289 --> 02:15:44.794]  Well, you can try, but I think you're doing the best that can be done, and that's just to make sure that people know that Ron Paul doesn't deserve that rating.
[02:15:44.834 --> 02:15:47.316]  He deserves the rating that Gun Owners of America gave him.
[02:15:47.696 --> 02:15:49.517]  You can find that rating on our website.
[02:15:50.738 --> 02:15:53.019]  This is the guy who's the real deal.
[02:15:53.299 --> 02:15:56.361]  By the way, on our website, not only can you find the ratings of each and every...
[02:15:56.841 --> 02:16:05.786]  ...of the candidates, major and minor parties as well, but you'll find the votes that we selected behind that, so you can tell what we were thinking about when we did our rating.
[02:16:07.047 --> 02:16:08.748]  Something the NRA doesn't even do.
[02:16:09.288 --> 02:16:10.709]  They're doing this in other races, too.
[02:16:10.729 --> 02:16:11.909]  You can't believe anything they say.
[02:16:11.969 --> 02:16:12.690]  It's very sad.
[02:16:13.317 --> 02:16:14.018]  We're good to go.
[02:16:14.038 --> 02:16:14.278]  I think?
[02:16:29.107 --> 02:16:31.329]  How's it going with all the Republican governors going after the guns?
[02:16:47.685 --> 02:16:52.448]  Well, I just can't imagine what's going on.
[02:16:52.488 --> 02:16:56.071]  And, of course, Bloomberg up there leading the pack of the mayors.
[02:16:57.371 --> 02:17:08.699]  I saw a debate the other night on one of the television shows, and a guy that used to work at what was then Handgun Control Incorporated was saying, oh, that it had gotten easier to get a...
[02:17:10.241 --> 02:17:15.327]  Well, now Bloomberg wants to get laws and deals passed where he's gun-grabbing in states around him.
[02:17:15.648 --> 02:17:21.295]  Yes, well, not only that, he's bragging that, oh, we're going to make it harder to get a concealed carry permit in New York City.
[02:17:21.475 --> 02:17:22.417]  Yeah, it was too easy.
[02:17:22.437 --> 02:17:24.760]  Yeah, you basically got to pay a...
[02:17:25.635 --> 02:17:26.295]  Official off $20,000.
[02:17:26.815 --> 02:17:30.737]  I appreciate you joining us, Larry Pratt.
[02:17:30.757 --> 02:17:34.098]  God bless you, and please help us fight the long haul, and take care.
[02:17:34.518 --> 02:17:35.238]  I will be doing that.
[02:17:35.298 --> 02:17:35.638]  Thank you.
[02:17:35.938 --> 02:17:36.278]  Take care.
[02:17:36.298 --> 02:17:37.099]  Thanks for the time.
[02:17:37.419 --> 02:17:37.819]  All right.
[02:17:37.839 --> 02:17:39.399]  We'll be right back into the election.
[02:17:39.419 --> 02:17:41.520]  More of your calls and tons of news on the war.
[02:17:41.560 --> 02:17:42.100]  Stay with us.
[02:17:45.181 --> 02:17:50.503]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson, here for the 2007 Red Book.
[02:17:53.012 --> 02:17:57.835]  The commodity markets like gold, silver, copper, aluminum, and oil have exploded over the last year.
[02:17:58.035 --> 02:18:00.777]  This is a glaring testimony of how quickly the U.S.
[02:18:00.817 --> 02:18:01.938]  dollar can be devalued.
[02:18:03.279 --> 02:18:07.881]  Many have turned to precious metals to provide a safe haven while increasing the potential profits.
[02:18:08.802 --> 02:18:16.067]  Though accumulating precious metals has been a proven method for the storage of wealth, it is important that you understand the market you are getting into.
[02:18:17.067 --> 02:18:20.109]  Midas Resources is offering the red book and silver dollar for only $27.95.
[02:18:22.259 --> 02:18:25.720]  The Red Book is the number one best-selling guide to gold and silver coins.
[02:18:26.701 --> 02:18:27.981]  Call for your copy today.
[02:18:28.221 --> 02:18:30.422]  It's 800-686-2237.
[02:18:31.482 --> 02:18:37.324]  If you've already accumulated or plan to get into the precious metals market, you simply must have the Red Book in your library.
[02:18:38.025 --> 02:18:38.445]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:18:38.485 --> 02:18:38.685]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:18:49.284 --> 02:18:56.687]  On February 29, 1892, the United States of America's Supreme Court declared us a Christian nation.
[02:18:57.767 --> 02:19:07.431]  However, over recent years, for the last three decades, there's been a deliberate war on Christianity in America to wipe out our heritage from the minds of our people.
[02:19:08.331 --> 02:19:14.914]  The First Amendment to the Constitution guarantees us religious freedom, and yet it's under attack today.
[02:19:15.888 --> 02:19:24.752]  We would like to send you a one-year absolutely free subscription to Newswatch Magazine that gives you the background of what is happening in America.
[02:19:25.332 --> 02:19:26.833]  Just call our toll-free number, 1-800-516-8736.
[02:19:26.913 --> 02:19:27.153]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[02:19:27.173 --> 02:19:27.333]  Call now.
[02:19:27.353 --> 02:19:32.736]  Our operators are standing by for an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[02:19:45.791 --> 02:19:51.072]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones introducing you to the incredible Berkey Solar Charger.
[02:19:51.272 --> 02:19:53.353]  Your source for free solar electricity.
[02:19:53.593 --> 02:20:00.714]  This portable system is the size of a book when folded and small enough to fit into a briefcase, handbag, or glove compartment.
[02:20:00.834 --> 02:20:12.357]  The Berkey Solar Charger has been designed to power the Berkey lights, LED lamps, as well as other applications such as mobile phones, radios, digital cameras, and PDAs when electricity is not available.
[02:20:12.677 --> 02:20:13.478]  We're good to go.
[02:20:45.658 --> 02:20:50.438]  Times are tough right now, but there are a lot of different ways to get ourselves out of this mess.
[02:20:50.658 --> 02:20:54.639]  Providing for our own food, water, and power are a good start.
[02:20:54.899 --> 02:21:01.200]  As you may have heard by now, Ken Solar has been configuring alternative energy packages for over a decade.
[02:21:01.440 --> 02:21:05.821]  One of Ken's most popular items right now is the new solar-powered generator.
[02:21:06.021 --> 02:21:11.302]  For a lot less than you'd expect, this portable system can chop up nearly a third of your electric bill.
[02:21:11.562 --> 02:21:17.064]  Getting yourself onto solar power is one of the most liberating things you can do for yourself and your family.
[02:21:17.245 --> 02:21:25.008]  The solar-powered generator will run your lights, fan, electric blanket, your refrigerator, and a whole slew of household items.
[02:21:25.308 --> 02:21:33.972]  Visit Ken's website at kensolar.com for free downloads, free videos and how-tos, and of course, the new solar-powered generator.
[02:21:34.212 --> 02:21:34.812]  We're good to go.
[02:21:34.872 --> 02:21:35.513]  We're good to go.
[02:22:00.632 --> 02:22:03.574]  Okay, I'm going to move quick, so have your questions and comments ready.
[02:22:04.114 --> 02:22:06.936]  Fred, Dan, Adam, Tim, Nancy, others.
[02:22:07.296 --> 02:22:13.080]  Tim in Nebraska on the Second Amendment topic and the disinformation pumped out by the NRA Gun Control Group.
[02:22:13.360 --> 02:22:13.961]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:22:14.661 --> 02:22:19.604]  Yeah, I just got the NRA and had them revoke my life membership.
[02:22:20.405 --> 02:22:26.909]  I got a number here for their Institute for Legislative Action, and people want to call them and complain.
[02:22:27.350 --> 02:22:29.431]  What did they say when you revoked your lifetime membership?
[02:22:30.655 --> 02:22:38.439]  Well, first I talked to someone that was part of the ILA and I first asked him why they did what they did.
[02:22:38.459 --> 02:22:42.361]  He said, well, just a minute.
[02:22:43.101 --> 02:22:46.163]  He said, I'm going to have to pull something up and see.
[02:22:47.023 --> 02:22:48.544]  I hung on there for a long time.
[02:22:48.564 --> 02:22:54.507]  Then he comes back and he says, well, I'm going to have to wait until somebody else gets in because I can't get that right now.
[02:22:55.748 --> 02:22:57.448]  So then I just unloaded on him.
[02:22:59.261 --> 02:23:12.751]  I told him I wanted to revoke my life membership and so he switched me over to somebody else and then they took me off and that was all that was said about it.
[02:23:13.012 --> 02:23:15.173]  I can't believe they'd try something that bold.
[02:23:16.895 --> 02:23:17.135]  Yeah.
[02:23:17.815 --> 02:23:18.616]  Does it make you mad?
[02:23:19.236 --> 02:23:19.817]  Oh, sure.
[02:23:21.919 --> 02:23:25.741]  I've known that they've compromised before and it's always irritated me.
[02:23:27.068 --> 02:23:30.849]  When they do something like this to Ron Paul, that was just blast raw.
[02:23:31.550 --> 02:23:32.250]  Well, it's blatant.
[02:23:32.290 --> 02:23:32.770]  It shows.
[02:23:32.810 --> 02:23:34.511]  And by the way, we've been looking into Sklar.
[02:23:34.551 --> 02:23:36.452]  He's got all these ethics violations pending.
[02:23:36.492 --> 02:23:38.572]  He's a big lobbyist for Big Agra.
[02:23:38.632 --> 02:23:41.353]  I mean, it's just he's a... Oh, man, he's so horrible.
[02:23:41.373 --> 02:23:42.174]  Thank you for the call.
[02:23:42.194 --> 02:23:45.835]  Would you like me to give out that number to call the NRA?
[02:23:46.115 --> 02:23:46.455]  Oh, sure.
[02:23:46.495 --> 02:23:46.835]  Go ahead.
[02:23:47.336 --> 02:23:47.516]  It's 800-392-8683.
[02:23:47.536 --> 02:23:49.256]  What's that number again? 800...
[02:23:56.886 --> 02:24:00.287]  392-8683.
[02:24:00.647 --> 02:24:01.507]  Thank you for doing that.
[02:24:01.987 --> 02:24:04.168]  Let's talk to Nancy in Texas on the same subject.
[02:24:04.188 --> 02:24:04.848]  Go ahead, Nancy.
[02:24:05.588 --> 02:24:05.849]  Hi.
[02:24:05.869 --> 02:24:06.429]  Hi.
[02:24:06.789 --> 02:24:09.350]  I just got through calling the NRA, too.
[02:24:09.490 --> 02:24:16.352]  What they told me it was about, I got them to answer me, was it had to do with the protection of Lawful Commerce and Arms Act.
[02:24:17.112 --> 02:24:17.692]  It was H.R.
[02:24:17.712 --> 02:24:17.692]  800.
[02:24:17.812 --> 02:24:21.233]  It had to do something about whether...
[02:24:22.103 --> 02:24:27.185]  Arms manufacturers could be held liable for any action that an owner had with a gun.
[02:24:28.385 --> 02:24:30.966]  And so that's what they said it was about.
[02:24:31.466 --> 02:24:34.967]  Well, the thing is, they're pro-gun locks, so he's bad because he's against that.
[02:24:35.367 --> 02:24:38.709]  And then I know the NRA was actually supporting that Arms Act.
[02:24:39.049 --> 02:24:40.629]  I mean, the point is, Ron Paul's pro-gun.
[02:24:40.649 --> 02:24:42.570]  You just heard Gunners of America.
[02:24:42.610 --> 02:24:44.090]  They've done a complete analysis of him.
[02:24:44.971 --> 02:24:47.872]  Oh, no, I've been pro-Ron Paul all my life.
[02:24:48.172 --> 02:24:48.972]  I mean, I still am.
[02:24:49.540 --> 02:24:52.303]  So I'm just reporting what they said.
[02:24:52.863 --> 02:24:57.527]  And I haven't looked into it any further, and I'm sure there's a darn good reason why he voted the way he voted.
[02:24:57.848 --> 02:24:59.909]  That's just not... Well, look at this.
[02:24:59.929 --> 02:25:02.572]  I have Sklar's own website now in a press release.
[02:25:03.112 --> 02:25:07.076]  Sklar is the only candidate in Texas 14 to receive an NRA's A rating.
[02:25:07.396 --> 02:25:13.862]  Paul gets only a B. And come it wrong, Paul's B rating indicates past votes for restrictive legislation.
[02:25:14.551 --> 02:25:17.494]  So, see, this is, and again, this isn't just about Texas.
[02:25:17.514 --> 02:25:18.374]  It's a national show.
[02:25:18.394 --> 02:25:23.058]  The reason we're talking about this is it illustrates what the NRA really is, and I'm just sick of it.
[02:25:23.639 --> 02:25:24.780]  What did you tell the NRA?
[02:25:25.601 --> 02:25:31.706]  Well, I told them I thought it was despicable because his opponent that they seemed to be endorsing was not pro-gun.
[02:25:32.432 --> 02:25:34.874]  And Ron Paul had a long history of being pro-gun.
[02:25:35.395 --> 02:25:41.941]  But again, in 76, when he first got in Congress and he went back later, they were for what happened in D.C.
[02:25:41.981 --> 02:25:42.762]  and didn't support him.
[02:25:43.222 --> 02:25:44.964]  He was the lone wolf fighting it then.
[02:25:45.064 --> 02:25:49.388]  And just the NRA is a group of Trojan horse, wolf and sheep's clothing creatures.
[02:25:49.408 --> 02:25:50.049]  Thanks for the call.
[02:25:50.409 --> 02:25:51.410]  I appreciate you doing that.
[02:25:51.730 --> 02:25:53.031]  Fred and Philly, you're on the air.
[02:25:53.051 --> 02:25:53.612]  Thanks for holding.
[02:25:55.134 --> 02:25:55.694]  Hi, Alex.
[02:25:55.875 --> 02:25:56.295]  Hey, Fred.
[02:25:56.315 --> 02:26:05.962]  You know, I really love your show, but I mean, I just would wish that you could stick on the issue of the fraudulent election.
[02:26:06.043 --> 02:26:09.986]  I think that there's going to be an election stolen from the people.
[02:26:10.506 --> 02:26:12.427]  Well, we know that.
[02:26:12.448 --> 02:26:13.969]  They stole it in 2000, 2002, 2004.
[02:26:14.249 --> 02:26:20.654]  And you're the only person who, and I know you have done most of the research with Beth Harris
[02:26:21.432 --> 02:26:23.313]  Vicki Collier, the Collier brothers.
[02:26:23.353 --> 02:26:25.214]  Yeah, I was talking about this 12 years ago.
[02:26:25.254 --> 02:26:26.034]  I know.
[02:26:28.235 --> 02:26:30.436]  I have a slight criticism of Bev Harris.
[02:26:31.857 --> 02:26:33.998]  Is she a perfectionist?
[02:26:34.018 --> 02:26:38.960]  Does she want to wait until everything can be verified in court before she comes forward?
[02:26:38.980 --> 02:26:39.861]  Well, it's been verified.
[02:26:39.881 --> 02:26:42.842]  We've had engineers go public that worked there, felons that worked there.
[02:26:43.242 --> 02:26:48.845]  She's going to have an HBO show on the way to steal an election.
[02:26:49.580 --> 02:26:53.583]  I don't know that much about what the show, you know, when it's going to air, but I just want to... Yeah, I know.
[02:26:53.623 --> 02:26:56.565]  She's been unavailable lately to come on because they've just been filming it and filming it.
[02:26:56.766 --> 02:26:57.346]  Okay, good.
[02:26:57.386 --> 02:27:07.374]  Well, Lynn Landis, that's a Philadelphia-based journalist who is one of the few people who knows about VNF and NEP.
[02:27:07.934 --> 02:27:14.079]  There's very few people who know about the other end of the pipeline, Alex, and that is... Yeah, let's talk about voter news service when we get back.
[02:27:14.119 --> 02:27:15.220]  Hey, you got the floor, brother.
[02:27:15.680 --> 02:27:16.341]  Stay there, Fred.
[02:27:16.361 --> 02:27:18.042]  And we'll go to Dan and...
[02:27:19.529 --> 02:27:21.189]  Adam and many others that are patiently holding.
[02:27:21.549 --> 02:27:27.011]  Infowars.com, JonesReport.com, PrisonPundit.com, Infowars.net are the websites.
[02:27:27.291 --> 02:27:28.031]  Spread the word.
[02:27:28.371 --> 02:27:29.251]  Keep it locked in.
[02:27:36.333 --> 02:27:37.233]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.713 --> 02:27:39.313]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:40.233 --> 02:27:42.954]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.118 --> 02:27:46.539]  We're good to go.
[02:28:03.200 --> 02:28:03.680]  We're good to go.
[02:28:20.373 --> 02:28:20.773]  We're good to go.
[02:28:20.793 --> 02:28:21.194]  We're good to go.
[02:28:21.234 --> 02:28:21.614]  We're good to go.
[02:28:45.896 --> 02:28:46.136]  Thank you.
[02:29:07.755 --> 02:29:14.259]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[02:29:14.439 --> 02:29:19.523]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[02:29:19.643 --> 02:29:28.529]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[02:29:28.789 --> 02:29:32.092]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5.

[02:29:36.097 --> 02:29:36.458]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:29:46.420 --> 02:29:48.842]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network.
[02:29:49.362 --> 02:29:52.664]  Let's ask the question that the Bush regime hopes you will never ask.
[02:29:53.044 --> 02:29:55.986]  That is, is the USA already bankrupt?
[02:29:56.266 --> 02:30:02.630]  As the world's biggest debtor nation, we are borrowing in excess of 80% of the world's net savings.
[02:30:02.710 --> 02:30:07.133]  That's $2 billion per day to finance the biggest deficit in history.
[02:30:07.353 --> 02:30:11.716]  Our creditors are becoming increasingly concerned that the debt can never be repaid.
[02:30:11.876 --> 02:30:14.478]  Japan and China, two of the largest holders of U.S.
[02:30:14.498 --> 02:30:17.260]  debt, are looking to greatly reduce their exposure to dollars.
[02:30:17.740 --> 02:30:20.282]  In fact, China has privately hinted that a U.S.
[02:30:20.322 --> 02:30:24.585]  attack on Iran could result in China dumping massive amounts of U.S.
[02:30:24.625 --> 02:30:25.466]  Treasury bonds.
[02:30:25.746 --> 02:30:30.389]  To find out more about this, call for a free report on the coming dollar collapse.
[02:30:30.549 --> 02:30:35.352]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.
[02:30:35.612 --> 02:30:43.997]  That's 1-8888-XANADU or 1-888-XANADU and ask for George.
[02:30:46.318 --> 02:30:48.540]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:30:49.100 --> 02:30:51.882]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:31:01.597 --> 02:31:06.160]  All right, we've got a load of phone lines.
[02:31:06.280 --> 02:31:09.763]  If you want to get involved, somebody hangs up.
[02:31:09.783 --> 02:31:09.903]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:31:09.923 --> 02:31:10.103]  800-259-9231.
[02:31:10.143 --> 02:31:12.305]  It's always important for me to remember to give the phone number out.
[02:31:12.665 --> 02:31:14.506]  I've done shows where I haven't given it out once.
[02:31:14.546 --> 02:31:16.027]  We've had loaded phones the whole time.
[02:31:16.067 --> 02:31:17.789]  It's craziness.
[02:31:18.729 --> 02:31:20.410]  We'll go back to your calls here in just a moment.
[02:31:21.071 --> 02:31:24.694]  I do hope that you'll go to Infowars.com and PrisonPundit.com today.
[02:31:25.214 --> 02:31:26.475]  There's a big article...
[02:31:27.726 --> 02:31:40.191]  Up right now, it's been two days in the writing by Paul Watson and yours truly, Armed Men Terrorize School, Michigan Raid Part of Unfolding Agenda to Mold Schools into Prisons and Students into Obedient Slaves.
[02:31:41.092 --> 02:31:44.533]  It is a detailed, lengthy treatise that Paul really did most of the work putting together.
[02:31:45.988 --> 02:31:52.131]  It needs to be read about how all over the school they're ravaging elementary, middle school, mainly, sometimes high school.
[02:31:52.411 --> 02:31:55.032]  They run and announce, screaming, pointing guns at their heads.
[02:31:55.072 --> 02:31:59.534]  The children soil themselves, attack dogs, bite them, rip apart their clothing.
[02:31:59.915 --> 02:32:01.435]  There's video of all this, by the way.
[02:32:01.595 --> 02:32:03.116]  We're not joking around about this.
[02:32:04.577 --> 02:32:07.338]  And this is part of a trauma-based mind control program.
[02:32:09.599 --> 02:32:10.920]  This article needs to be seen.
[02:32:11.818 --> 02:32:16.600]  Just like the report we're going to be putting out in the next few hours on jonesreport.com.
[02:32:17.021 --> 02:32:18.381]  I think that's the first place you'll see it.
[02:32:18.401 --> 02:32:20.682]  It'll be jonesreport.com.
[02:32:20.742 --> 02:32:27.826]  I say that because I know the webmasters will be in at jonesreport.com at 6 o'clock or however long it takes for Kevin to write this article.
[02:32:27.866 --> 02:32:31.547]  He's got so much data now from Ron Paul, Larry Pratt, and all these other people.
[02:32:32.468 --> 02:32:36.049]  And all the stuff we've dug up on the person he's running against.
[02:32:36.210 --> 02:32:37.070]  Oh, my gosh.
[02:32:37.822 --> 02:32:47.865]  Pro-war, neocon, big lobbyist for the Real ID Act, the Animal ID Act, just anything.
[02:32:47.886 --> 02:32:50.867]  And the stuff, the lies he tells about Ron Paul.
[02:32:51.147 --> 02:32:52.007]  I've got his website.
[02:32:52.047 --> 02:32:53.527]  Ron Paul's a gun grabber.
[02:32:53.547 --> 02:32:57.889]  Ron Paul's against security.
[02:32:58.009 --> 02:32:59.670]  Ron Paul supports Mark Foley.
[02:32:59.950 --> 02:33:03.671]  Then you read, Ron Paul doesn't support Mark Foley, the pervert.
[02:33:04.361 --> 02:33:08.344]  Ron Paul was against stuff that would make you sign in with an ID to get on the web.
[02:33:08.384 --> 02:33:10.106]  He was against shutting down web freedom.
[02:33:10.846 --> 02:33:18.772]  But by the time this guy, this lobbyist, who's thrown every dirty trick in the book at Paul, plus, again, Tom DeLay, the criminal, has rewritten the district against Paul.
[02:33:19.193 --> 02:33:22.255]  The Republican Party's been against him since the 70s when he was anti-gun.
[02:33:22.515 --> 02:33:24.017]  You heard Larry Pratt say that.
[02:33:25.678 --> 02:33:31.102]  Did you know the NRA got the 68 or 69, I forget, Gun Control Act through?
[02:33:31.262 --> 02:33:32.023]  We forget this.
[02:33:32.063 --> 02:33:33.304]  They're Judas goats, folks.
[02:33:34.705 --> 02:33:36.768]  And you don't know what a Judas goat is.
[02:33:36.788 --> 02:33:39.431]  That's a trained goat that leads the other goats into the slaughter pen.
[02:33:39.811 --> 02:33:40.953]  He's the leader, the billy goat.
[02:33:41.273 --> 02:33:42.114]  You don't kill him.
[02:33:42.194 --> 02:33:43.596]  He just goes out the back each time.
[02:33:44.938 --> 02:33:47.120]  So I want to get into this article Paul Watson put together.
[02:33:47.961 --> 02:33:49.363]  A little bit of my tutelage, I guess.
[02:33:50.344 --> 02:33:51.385]  But I also want to go to your calls.
[02:33:51.425 --> 02:33:52.627]  Let's go back to Fred in Philly.
[02:33:53.357 --> 02:33:56.678]  Voter News Services, it's not just the locals stealing.
[02:33:57.058 --> 02:34:09.643]  In the past, the locals would collect the data and send it up to the feds, who would then, at this quasi-private public group with armed men with machine guns in New York, I guess off of 34th Street, they would tell you then who had won.
[02:34:10.884 --> 02:34:13.304]  Well, they were in Somerville, New Jersey for the 2004.
[02:34:13.344 --> 02:34:14.765]  That's right.
[02:34:14.785 --> 02:34:15.325]  They moved them.
[02:34:15.545 --> 02:34:19.887]  And they were part of that corporate... There's a picture on their own website...
[02:34:22.292 --> 02:34:25.815]  Media Consultants Incorporated or some kind of... Yeah, they just changed the name again.
[02:34:25.835 --> 02:34:37.003]  But the way to understand this is, America, do you know where the numbers come from that Dan Rather and Peter Jennings, now dead, and Fox News announce it?
[02:34:37.263 --> 02:34:38.264]  And the answer is no.
[02:34:38.324 --> 02:34:40.906]  Well, it's... When does this new system start?
[02:34:40.966 --> 02:34:45.109]  Before the states would announce their numbers, it would then be tabulated you'd learn the next day.
[02:34:45.789 --> 02:34:46.170]  Now...
[02:34:47.251 --> 02:34:55.772]  A private group, very shadowy, very secretive, made up of, quote, media heads and government funding, meet at generally secret locations.
[02:34:55.812 --> 02:34:57.633]  Now they've been forced to make it public.
[02:34:57.993 --> 02:34:59.373]  And then they tell you who wins.
[02:34:59.393 --> 02:35:02.714]  Then later it never matches with the state and counties, but they don't care.
[02:35:02.774 --> 02:35:05.014]  By then it's forgotten because it's the media involved in it.
[02:35:05.034 --> 02:35:07.855]  It's like the media goes to CFR and Bilderberg group meetings.
[02:35:08.275 --> 02:35:08.735]  Exactly.
[02:35:08.895 --> 02:35:16.416]  And even if there is a contradiction between any communication between any other system, between the precincts and the
[02:35:16.997 --> 02:35:20.480]  Secretary of State, that is not considered official.
[02:35:20.580 --> 02:35:24.203]  They have taken over what is deemed as official.
[02:35:24.623 --> 02:35:25.404]  And that's wrong.
[02:35:25.925 --> 02:35:32.950]  Because we have to decide by people who are, you know, what is it called?
[02:35:34.532 --> 02:35:35.913]  Citizen overseers.
[02:35:35.953 --> 02:35:37.794]  What is that called when you're at the polling place?
[02:35:37.815 --> 02:35:38.275]  Poll watchers.
[02:35:38.435 --> 02:35:39.516]  Yeah, I was a poll watcher.
[02:35:39.556 --> 02:35:43.099]  And of course, people don't know when this started.
[02:35:43.239 --> 02:35:44.200]  It was set up...
[02:35:45.573 --> 02:35:56.222]  One month after Kennedy got his head blown off for the 1964 election, 1963 election, during that campaign, and that's when the CIA, the shadow government, took over.
[02:35:56.963 --> 02:36:12.135]  They got secrecy in 49 with the National, 47 with the National Security, my numbers are off today, 47 with the National Securities Act, the shadow government formed, then it took over in 63, and then they just started announcing who'd really won when it wasn't even real.
[02:36:12.734 --> 02:36:14.735]  Yeah, and you know, I have to commend you.
[02:36:14.875 --> 02:36:16.196]  You have stuck to your guns.
[02:36:16.876 --> 02:36:29.944]  I can finally spend a lot of years looking into this exhaustively and looking into the patents that are either bad or good, depending on how you feel about accountability.
[02:36:30.584 --> 02:36:37.067]  And you and I believe it's a small number of people that know both ends of it.
[02:36:37.107 --> 02:36:39.729]  You have some mathematicians that know that
[02:36:40.302 --> 02:36:47.568]  You know, a certain election would have to have been stolen because of the crazy results, the crazy anomalies.
[02:36:47.588 --> 02:36:52.452]  But you know about both ends of it, and very few people know about both ends of this system.
[02:36:52.853 --> 02:36:54.254]  And that's what has to be emphasized.
[02:36:54.554 --> 02:37:02.320]  It's not just a matter of the machines, and not just a matter of begging these or making these companies do something with the machines.
[02:37:02.441 --> 02:37:06.344]  We have scores of elections going back to 1963 where it comes out...
[02:37:07.066 --> 02:37:07.366]  Thank you.
[02:37:07.386 --> 02:37:07.867]  Thank you.
[02:37:23.732 --> 02:37:30.638]  So you've got to fix it at the top and fix it at the bottom, and then you've got to fix it where Kerry takes a dive or Al Gore takes a dive, you see.
[02:37:30.958 --> 02:37:32.520]  You can't just steal an election locally.
[02:37:32.540 --> 02:37:33.681]  You've got to steal it federally.
[02:37:33.901 --> 02:37:36.323]  Then you've got to have the person who had it stolen from them.
[02:37:36.503 --> 02:37:38.725]  Well, they were a setup the whole time to begin with.
[02:37:39.305 --> 02:37:48.834]  And I have talked to two statisticians that came out among a whole group of them that signed a letter declaiming the...
[02:37:49.815 --> 02:37:50.575]  I have this idea.
[02:37:50.595 --> 02:37:52.856]  Look, there is some way to counter this on an operational basis.
[02:37:52.896 --> 02:37:54.316]  Not talking about the ultimate solution.
[02:38:13.533 --> 02:38:21.358]  But there has to be an easy, automated way that's trustworthy for everyone who votes to have an independent tally.
[02:38:21.618 --> 02:38:27.141]  When you go vote, also go to a particular... Well, sir, as you know, let me stop you.
[02:38:27.241 --> 02:38:32.184]  The last three elections... Don't talk to the VNS exit poll people.
[02:38:32.284 --> 02:38:39.469]  Don't talk to them because they can fake that and then they can use that as evidence that... Let me stop you.
[02:38:39.489 --> 02:38:40.489]  You're not going to talk to them.
[02:38:40.549 --> 02:38:41.530]  No one's ever seen them.
[02:38:43.341 --> 02:38:44.362]  I mean, they don't exist.
[02:38:44.722 --> 02:38:45.802]  They're not exit polling.
[02:38:46.423 --> 02:38:47.863]  That's a whole other facet to this.
[02:38:48.124 --> 02:38:50.245]  Well, I'd love to hear more about it.
[02:38:50.525 --> 02:38:52.766]  Well, I mean, I talked to the Collier brothers before they both died.
[02:38:52.806 --> 02:38:53.586]  I talked to their daughter.
[02:38:53.646 --> 02:38:55.367]  I talked to the experts that have witnessed it.
[02:38:55.407 --> 02:38:56.348]  No one's ever seen them.
[02:38:57.568 --> 02:38:58.569]  They just make it up.
[02:38:58.849 --> 02:39:00.210]  Now, you have media.
[02:39:01.630 --> 02:39:03.911]  This is like this SCL story.
[02:39:04.271 --> 02:39:06.653]  You are really right on with that.
[02:39:06.873 --> 02:39:08.574]  I have really come around.
[02:39:08.594 --> 02:39:09.254]  I mean, I really...
[02:39:09.736 --> 02:39:14.099]  Endorse your verdict on that SEL story, Strategic Communication Laboratories.
[02:39:14.679 --> 02:39:24.485]  The big media doesn't even care if they're going to be wiped out by this process of strategic communication.
[02:39:24.745 --> 02:39:26.586]  They don't care because they're part of that.
[02:39:27.346 --> 02:39:28.587]  And so you're right.
[02:39:28.607 --> 02:39:29.648]  Do you remember that story?
[02:39:30.048 --> 02:39:30.688]  Yes.
[02:39:31.028 --> 02:39:32.089]  Okay.
[02:39:32.169 --> 02:39:33.330]  This is like that issue.
[02:39:33.410 --> 02:39:37.212]  And I think the people who know most about it have to actually meet
[02:39:38.317 --> 02:39:40.199]  And get our argument home.
[02:39:40.239 --> 02:39:43.021]  Well, look, look, look, look, and I appreciate your call.
[02:39:44.382 --> 02:39:56.430]  All the polls, all the data, the exit polls conducted by independent media and even mainstream local media that's not part of the conspiracy, part of the criminal program, show that Hagel loses by 15 points, but he wins by 10.
[02:39:57.490 --> 02:40:05.696]  Now, folks, number one, a poll, scientific, all the polls showing 10 to 15 percent points he's going to lose by, number one, you know it's stolen if he'd have won by one point.
[02:40:06.440 --> 02:40:07.301]  Right here where I live?
[02:40:35.402 --> 02:40:41.124]  And he's Janet Reno's favorite lawyer, pro-China traitor, involved in every evil you can imagine.
[02:40:41.784 --> 02:40:44.605]  He marries Lowry Mays' daughter, the owner of Clear Channel.
[02:40:44.625 --> 02:40:46.605]  Lowry Mays is also his biggest political contributor.
[02:40:47.926 --> 02:40:50.666]  Privately, then Clear Channel is his second biggest political contributor.
[02:40:51.807 --> 02:40:58.829]  And he's going to lose by over 10 points in all the polls, and then he magically wins by a huge margin.
[02:41:01.029 --> 02:41:02.150]  The polls aren't off 20 points.
[02:41:03.470 --> 02:41:04.551]  You go, but you just said 10.
[02:41:04.851 --> 02:41:05.791]  It was really more than 10.
[02:41:06.271 --> 02:41:07.932]  Some were like 9, some were 15.
[02:41:08.252 --> 02:41:09.553]  Point is, it was over 10 points.
[02:41:09.873 --> 02:41:11.474]  But then he won by over 10 points.
[02:41:11.494 --> 02:41:12.654]  So that's 20 points.
[02:41:12.934 --> 02:41:14.955]  These polls aren't 20 points off!
[02:41:15.436 --> 02:41:18.697]  You see, in the past they were always right.
[02:41:19.337 --> 02:41:24.920]  Now they're wrong in these key contested districts with the neocon candidates.
[02:41:26.301 --> 02:41:27.081]  Just like Mexico.
[02:41:29.039 --> 02:41:30.120]  We're good to go.
[02:41:50.469 --> 02:41:56.533]  99.999.
[02:41:50.489 --> 02:41:56.533]  I mean, there were ballot boxes where there'd be nothing but.
[02:41:56.593 --> 02:41:57.393]  This was in the BBC.
[02:41:57.553 --> 02:41:58.614]  It was in the Mexican papers.
[02:41:58.854 --> 02:42:00.035]  It was in the Latin American papers.
[02:42:00.355 --> 02:42:06.119]  I mean, you'd have ballot boxes from areas where the polls showed everyone was basically voting for the anti-establishment guy.
[02:42:06.139 --> 02:42:06.619]  It didn't matter.
[02:42:06.860 --> 02:42:11.122]  Oh, no, we have thousands of ballots, and they all say this guy's going to win.
[02:42:11.823 --> 02:42:14.785]  So they started burning down Mexico City and Oaxaca.
[02:42:15.946 --> 02:42:19.368]  Three months into this, they're running around foaming at the mouth down there, and they should be.
[02:42:21.917 --> 02:42:26.981]  And they're down there gunning down reporters and gunning down women and children and running over people with tanks.
[02:42:28.282 --> 02:42:30.223]  You've got Tiananmen Square going on down there.
[02:42:31.364 --> 02:42:31.904]  And you know what?
[02:42:31.944 --> 02:42:33.305]  That's why they're setting up a police state.
[02:42:33.546 --> 02:42:36.168]  Because they know it's going to get to that point here.
[02:42:37.849 --> 02:42:38.689]  I mean, you think it's bad.
[02:42:38.950 --> 02:42:41.752]  Listen, in the past, 97% of... I keep saying this.
[02:42:41.792 --> 02:42:44.614]  Listen, 97% are against the toll roads.
[02:42:44.874 --> 02:42:46.175]  And that's in a Houston Chronicle poll.
[02:42:46.195 --> 02:42:47.616]  There have been other polls showing even higher.
[02:42:48.621 --> 02:42:52.604]  But that's down in neocon brain-dead Houston where they'll do whatever Rick Perry says.
[02:42:53.184 --> 02:42:56.747]  I mean, Rick Perry could give them dog poo and tell them it's a chocolate bar and they'd eat it in Houston.
[02:42:57.247 --> 02:42:59.629]  Sorry to be gross, but that's what we're talking about here.
[02:43:00.330 --> 02:43:01.491]  I mean, they're that brain-dead.
[02:43:01.511 --> 02:43:06.574]  97% in the scientific Houston Chronicle poll they did last year.
[02:43:06.755 --> 02:43:08.816]  That's with the public not knowing any of the details.
[02:43:11.138 --> 02:43:12.559]  I mean, now they found out.
[02:43:12.579 --> 02:43:15.281]  I remember the Chronicle locally run by that beatnik
[02:43:17.094 --> 02:43:20.256]  Lewis Black wrote a story a few months ago saying it's a conspiracy.
[02:43:20.636 --> 02:43:22.037]  Centra isn't foreign-owned.
[02:43:22.077 --> 02:43:24.138]  It's all over the news it's Spanish-owned.
[02:43:25.299 --> 02:43:27.060]  That's the kind of lies we deal with.
[02:43:27.340 --> 02:43:28.961]  Ron Paul's anti-gun.
[02:43:29.462 --> 02:43:31.263]  Alex is American Al-Qaeda.
[02:43:32.003 --> 02:43:35.205]  Alex is a liar and says the toll roads are foreign-owned.
[02:43:35.846 --> 02:43:39.708]  I mean, that's like saying, I'm a liar, George Bush isn't white.
[02:43:39.808 --> 02:43:45.432]  I mean, it just... The level of lying by these people
[02:43:47.998 --> 02:43:57.080]  And so you've got 90% of Americans in a major Gallup poll, it used to be 87% of them, illegal aliens demonstrated and it backfired, are against open borders.
[02:43:57.460 --> 02:43:58.761]  What do the Republicans and Democrats do?
[02:43:58.781 --> 02:44:01.301]  They give you open borders and then say they've got border security.
[02:44:01.781 --> 02:44:05.442]  And they try to give you an amnesty plan and say it is an amnesty when it's the biggest amnesty ever.
[02:44:06.303 --> 02:44:09.283]  Why is 97% against the toll roads but they're just doing it?
[02:44:09.303 --> 02:44:11.524]  90% against open borders, they just do it.
[02:44:12.244 --> 02:44:15.665]  70 plus percent against the war, they just do it and widen it and put more troops in.
[02:44:16.374 --> 02:44:17.895]  That proves it right there.
[02:44:18.336 --> 02:44:20.137]  In the past, they were scared of your vote.
[02:44:20.397 --> 02:44:22.059]  In the past, they knew you could throw them out.
[02:44:22.299 --> 02:44:23.240]  Not anymore, brother.
[02:44:23.720 --> 02:44:37.071]  And they got attack dog police with a huge armored compound just full of those Darth Vader outfits and the mask and the armor and the black helmets and the machine guns and the rubber bullets and the microwave guns.
[02:44:37.191 --> 02:44:42.615]  Big old armored vehicles with huge microwave guns and sound cannons like something out of Blade Runner.
[02:44:42.996 --> 02:44:44.397]  I mean, they're ready, folks.
[02:44:44.717 --> 02:44:45.637]  We're good to go.
[02:45:08.687 --> 02:45:15.451]  Even a good cop who won't give you a ticket or help an old lady change her tire, and I know a lot of you are good, you get in a mob psychology.
[02:45:15.471 --> 02:45:16.472]  Go read your own criminology.
[02:45:16.772 --> 02:45:18.293]  You get in that gang psychology.
[02:45:18.333 --> 02:45:19.353]  Read your own gang handbook.
[02:45:19.574 --> 02:45:28.659]  When you're out there on that line in those black uniforms, they teach you to beat your batons on your knee, on the pad, or on your chest pad, and try to scare us.
[02:45:29.079 --> 02:45:30.100]  Shame on you.
[02:45:30.580 --> 02:45:31.621]  Shame on you.
[02:45:33.582 --> 02:45:34.382]  You fools.
[02:45:34.602 --> 02:45:37.004]  It's like you're burning down your own house, you idiots.
[02:45:40.596 --> 02:45:43.419]  They don't punish the police when they do wrong, so then the public hates them.
[02:45:43.959 --> 02:45:45.701]  It's just so sick.
[02:45:47.242 --> 02:45:49.465]  You don't keep your own house clean because you work for criminals.
[02:45:50.205 --> 02:45:51.727]  Armed men terrorize school.
[02:45:51.787 --> 02:45:58.113]  Michigan raid, part of unfolding agenda to mold schools into prisons and students into obedient slaves by Paul Watson.
[02:45:58.694 --> 02:46:01.517]  A recent incident in which armed riot police...
[02:46:03.268 --> 02:46:04.429]  Well, I've changed that poll.
[02:46:04.469 --> 02:46:05.911]  It's actually anti-terror police.
[02:46:06.511 --> 02:46:22.387]  Rated at Michigan Junior High School as part of a drill that the children were not aware of was about to take place, raises the bar in the pursuit of an agenda to totally transform public schools into prison camps set up to breed continuous generations of obedient slaves.
[02:46:22.467 --> 02:46:22.968]  And that's true.
[02:46:22.988 --> 02:46:24.289]  They're training them to be slaves.
[02:46:25.710 --> 02:46:27.352]  It's like training the dog to be submissive.
[02:46:28.035 --> 02:46:35.946]  A school safety drill that included police officers in riot gear with weapons has caused concern among some parents who say it was too realistic and frightened some students.
[02:46:36.407 --> 02:46:43.456]  Students who were unaware police were conducting the drill were taken from classrooms into the halls, patted down by officers, and asked what they had in their pockets.
[02:46:43.476 --> 02:46:45.019]  The newspapers said they screamed at them.
[02:46:45.519 --> 02:46:47.962]  Some of the kids were so scared they just about wet their pants.
[02:46:48.222 --> 02:46:48.983]  We've talked to parents.
[02:46:49.023 --> 02:46:49.883]  They wet their pants.
[02:46:50.344 --> 02:46:53.967]  Said Marge Bradshaw, a parent whose four children in Godfrey Lee schools.
[02:46:54.368 --> 02:46:57.310]  I think it's pure wrong that the students and the parents were not informed of this.
[02:46:57.691 --> 02:47:02.395]  The students were not told that the drill was about to take place, and the teachers were given just a moment's notice.
[02:47:03.236 --> 02:47:07.020]  But then the principal and the police contradict themselves and say no, no warning was given.
[02:47:07.760 --> 02:47:10.283]  The following, as an incident in early October...
[02:47:11.095 --> 02:47:11.455]  We're good to go.
[02:47:32.230 --> 02:47:41.297]  Face up against the wall, then in Guantanamo-style squats, as they were handcuffed, and canine dogs sniffed their backsides.
[02:47:41.657 --> 02:47:48.362]  Paul, the video shows them, at least the video I saw, school security showed the dogs grabbing their bags and ripping them open with hatred.
[02:47:49.703 --> 02:47:51.344]  Imagine that.
[02:47:52.665 --> 02:47:55.207]  No drugs were found at the Groove Creek Police Department.
[02:47:57.046 --> 02:48:06.994]  Again, no drugs were found as the Groose Creek Police Department, the city, as well as the Berkeley County School District, had to pay $1.6 million for violating the rights of nearly 150 students caught in the raid.
[02:48:07.535 --> 02:48:18.203]  The three had to sign a contract decree barring similar activities in the future, but it included a waiver where probable cause or voluntary consent could be cited to conduct further raids.
[02:48:18.864 --> 02:48:19.945]  And the article goes on.
[02:48:21.631 --> 02:48:23.913]  And again, Armed Men Terrorize School.
[02:48:24.454 --> 02:48:25.955]  The article goes on for three more pages.
[02:48:25.975 --> 02:48:27.777]  I'm going to come back and take some final calls.
[02:48:28.157 --> 02:48:33.242]  It details how they're doing it everywhere, how people are being conditioned.
[02:48:34.383 --> 02:48:36.745]  It's amazing.
[02:48:37.546 --> 02:48:38.127]  It's amazing.
[02:48:38.187 --> 02:48:39.268]  Putting guns to their heads.
[02:48:39.288 --> 02:48:42.010]  By the way, our witnesses said they put guns to their heads.
[02:48:42.451 --> 02:48:43.512]  That needs to be in the article.
[02:48:43.532 --> 02:48:44.533]  I'll be right back.
[02:48:49.190 --> 02:48:52.372]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[02:48:52.712 --> 02:48:54.673]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[02:48:55.033 --> 02:49:02.697]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:49:03.377 --> 02:49:10.421]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:49:10.821 --> 02:49:13.763]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iraq.
[02:49:14.143 --> 02:49:16.104]  A White House program to disseminate fake news.
[02:49:16.124 --> 02:49:16.444]  NSA spies.
[02:49:19.134 --> 02:49:22.215]  The latest 9-11 information and much, much more.
[02:49:22.535 --> 02:49:26.035]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:49:26.516 --> 02:49:28.436]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:49:28.776 --> 02:49:32.697]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:49:45.993 --> 02:49:47.854]  Dad, can we stop?
[02:49:48.175 --> 02:49:49.696]  We need to go to the bathroom.
[02:49:50.116 --> 02:49:50.356]  What?
[02:49:50.717 --> 02:49:51.077]  Again?
[02:49:51.497 --> 02:49:53.118]  We just stopped two hours ago.
[02:49:53.198 --> 02:49:57.622]  Honey, let's stop, because I gave the kids their spark-burkey water bottles.
[02:49:57.862 --> 02:49:59.143]  Why did you do that?
[02:49:59.363 --> 02:50:05.147]  Because they can't drink and talk at the same time, and that way we don't have to listen to them singing, Are we there yet?
[02:50:05.447 --> 02:50:06.488]  Are we there yet?
[02:50:06.588 --> 02:50:07.649]  for the entire trip.
[02:50:07.909 --> 02:50:10.091]  Hmm, I didn't think about that.
[02:50:10.591 --> 02:50:11.572]  Great idea.
[02:50:11.592 --> 02:50:14.434]  Yeah, and it's cheap entertainment for the kids.
[02:50:14.818 --> 02:50:17.282]  Bottled water costs around 75 cents a bottle.
[02:50:17.483 --> 02:50:21.890]  And using our Bertie Sport bottles, it costs us less than two and a half cents per refill.
[02:50:22.150 --> 02:50:22.451]  Honey!
[02:50:23.294 --> 02:50:24.535]  You're terrific!
[02:50:24.915 --> 02:50:26.416]  Oh, honey, so are you.
[02:50:26.516 --> 02:50:29.937]  You're the one that bought the family our sport Berkey water bottles.
[02:50:30.217 --> 02:50:30.998]  Now can we stop?
[02:50:31.498 --> 02:50:32.238]  I need to go, too.

[02:52:22.285 --> 02:52:23.927]  Dan, you're on the air from Missouri.
[02:52:23.947 --> 02:52:24.287]  Welcome.
[02:52:24.668 --> 02:52:25.509]  Hey, how are you doing, Alex?
[02:52:25.529 --> 02:52:25.789]  Good, sir.
[02:52:26.350 --> 02:52:36.361]  Hey, I just wanted to let you know I'm actually vacationing up in Chicago, and I went to the Virgin Megastorm, Michigan Avenue, and was able to pick up three copies of Terror Storm.
[02:52:36.974 --> 02:52:38.915]  Yeah, it was delivered to all the stores.
[02:52:39.535 --> 02:52:40.476]  Barnes and Nobles has over 2,000.
[02:52:40.516 --> 02:52:43.097]  Hastings has over 500.
[02:52:43.177 --> 02:52:45.258]  They are holding them and not saying they have them.
[02:52:45.658 --> 02:52:47.919]  We have them red-handed now two days into this.
[02:52:48.279 --> 02:52:50.541]  It is outrageous, but Virgin is carrying it good.
[02:52:51.801 --> 02:52:52.501]  That's hilarious.
[02:52:52.982 --> 02:52:57.444]  The other day I was actually listening to you guys online.
[02:52:58.314 --> 02:53:02.095]  I heard you play a Johnny Cash cover of Depeche Mode's Personal Jesus.
[02:53:02.495 --> 02:53:02.696]  Yeah.
[02:53:02.876 --> 02:53:06.037]  And, you know, they've got a new album that came out.
[02:53:06.057 --> 02:53:06.717]  I love that.
[02:53:06.777 --> 02:53:08.317]  John the Revelator.
[02:53:08.357 --> 02:53:09.478]  Exactly.
[02:53:10.218 --> 02:53:11.539]  To the highest high.
[02:53:11.999 --> 02:53:15.120]  Yeah, take him up to the top of the mountain top and let him tell his book of lies.
[02:53:15.820 --> 02:53:17.961]  Yeah, I just wanted to let you know about that.
[02:53:18.001 --> 02:53:19.421]  There's actually a Google video.
[02:53:19.481 --> 02:53:21.042]  I love that music video.
[02:53:21.162 --> 02:53:22.182]  Oh, that's so good.
[02:53:22.262 --> 02:53:23.823]  Yeah, Depeche is like my passion.
[02:53:23.863 --> 02:53:26.844]  I love him to death, and I think they've got some really great writing, but...
[02:53:27.472 --> 02:53:37.480]  The other thing I wanted to let you know is I'm probably the first caller that's ever called into your show, but I just wanted to let you know I actually work for Viacom.
[02:53:40.302 --> 02:53:41.383]  It's really interesting.
[02:53:42.324 --> 02:53:51.611]  I've worked for this company for a few years, and just knowing what their programming actually is, it's really kind of sick.
[02:53:52.563 --> 02:53:53.223]  To be quite honest.
[02:53:53.243 --> 02:53:57.066]  Well, I mean, Nickelodeon is there trying to sexualize the kids when they're 10.
[02:53:57.566 --> 02:53:59.447]  Sumner Redstone is a piece of work, isn't he?
[02:53:59.827 --> 02:54:02.089]  Yeah, well, actually, Sumner Redstone is an alias.
[02:54:02.109 --> 02:54:03.029]  You know what his real name is?
[02:54:03.770 --> 02:54:04.770]  I forget, but yeah.
[02:54:04.870 --> 02:54:07.752]  Yeah, it's like Murray Rothstein or something like that.
[02:54:08.833 --> 02:54:10.013]  No, it's longer than that.
[02:54:10.033 --> 02:54:10.974]  Oh, really?
[02:54:11.334 --> 02:54:13.696]  Yeah, actually, I had a co-worker that told me about it.
[02:54:13.756 --> 02:54:20.820]  But, yeah, unfortunately, I missed the symposium, but when I was looking at it on the...
[02:54:21.898 --> 02:54:24.440]  On the video, it was incredible.
[02:54:24.460 --> 02:54:27.502]  I hope to God that you guys have some more stuff like that in the future.
[02:54:27.542 --> 02:54:30.184]  Well, those extras are on the DVD, and thank you for the support.
[02:54:30.444 --> 02:54:32.446]  Did you buy all three copies, or were there more copies?
[02:54:32.766 --> 02:54:33.767]  Well, actually, no.
[02:54:33.927 --> 02:54:34.988]  I bought three copies.
[02:54:35.028 --> 02:54:41.793]  There were three copies left on the shelf, and actually, my wife and I, when we go out today, I'm going to stop by there today and see if there's any more on the shelf.
[02:54:42.333 --> 02:54:43.274]  You are the man.
[02:54:43.334 --> 02:54:43.754]  Thank you for this.
[02:54:43.834 --> 02:54:45.275]  And call me someday earlier in the show.
[02:54:45.296 --> 02:54:46.997]  I'm sorry you've been holding for 30 minutes.
[02:54:47.037 --> 02:54:51.000]  Call me earlier in the show so you can tell us about the inside workings of Viacom.
[02:54:52.028 --> 02:54:52.968]  Hey, I'm on vacation.
[02:54:53.048 --> 02:54:53.729]  What can I tell you?
[02:54:54.129 --> 02:54:55.109]  Hey, you're awesome.
[02:54:55.129 --> 02:54:55.689]  Thank you, brother.
[02:54:56.629 --> 02:54:57.330]  I appreciate it.
[02:54:57.350 --> 02:55:01.571]  Let's talk to Adam in Colorado.
[02:55:01.611 --> 02:55:02.011]  Go ahead.
[02:55:02.031 --> 02:55:05.192]  Hello, Alex.
[02:55:06.052 --> 02:55:06.192]  Hi.
[02:55:06.633 --> 02:55:06.853]  Hi.
[02:55:07.253 --> 02:55:10.794]  I live in Denver, and we just had a 9-11 call.
[02:55:11.274 --> 02:55:12.134]  I can barely hear you.
[02:55:12.154 --> 02:55:13.415]  Just try to put the phone up to your mouth.
[02:55:13.435 --> 02:55:16.836]  Can you hear me better now?
[02:55:17.176 --> 02:55:18.096]  Not really, but whatever.
[02:55:18.136 --> 02:55:18.436]  Go ahead.
[02:55:18.456 --> 02:55:21.097]  I can turn up the volume.
[02:55:21.910 --> 02:55:22.610]  I live in Denver.
[02:55:22.630 --> 02:55:27.592]  We just had a 9-11 Scholars for Truth meeting here in Denver and in Boulder.
[02:55:28.452 --> 02:55:29.012]  I went there.
[02:55:29.092 --> 02:55:30.233]  I met Steven Jones.
[02:55:31.233 --> 02:55:38.635]  I handed out DVDs, hairstorms, and 9-11 info cards.
[02:55:38.715 --> 02:55:42.896]  I just want to encourage everybody to go out there and hand out 9-11 info cards and DVDs.
[02:55:42.976 --> 02:55:43.797]  It really feels good.
[02:55:43.817 --> 02:55:45.577]  Everybody's really responsive.
[02:55:45.897 --> 02:55:46.518]  Take action.
[02:55:46.538 --> 02:55:47.518]  People are really responsive.
[02:55:47.558 --> 02:55:48.138]  They'll read it.
[02:55:48.278 --> 02:55:50.119]  They'll start asking you questions.
[02:55:50.179 --> 02:55:51.319]  A few people are rude.
[02:55:51.755 --> 02:55:53.095]  I really want to encourage people to do it.
[02:55:53.115 --> 02:55:53.735]  It feels good.
[02:55:54.276 --> 02:55:55.456]  I really believe it's the right thing to do.
[02:55:55.816 --> 02:55:56.056]  Good.
[02:55:56.116 --> 02:55:56.896]  Good to hear from you.
[02:55:56.956 --> 02:55:59.817]  I'm sorry to Ron and Crispin and others.
[02:55:59.877 --> 02:56:00.777]  Call me back tomorrow.
[02:56:01.557 --> 02:56:03.217]  We'll get to your calls tomorrow.
[02:56:03.497 --> 02:56:09.579]  More great info, more powerful info in the fight for civilization here against the New World Order.
[02:56:09.719 --> 02:56:10.619]  I love you all.
[02:56:10.679 --> 02:56:11.959]  I thank you for all your support.
[02:56:12.019 --> 02:56:17.100]  The affiliates, the listeners, the sponsors, the great folks running the broadcast up at Genesis.
[02:56:17.800 --> 02:56:19.361]  I'll be back tonight, 9 to midnight.
[02:56:20.361 --> 02:56:20.921]  Back tomorrow, 11 to 2.
[02:56:22.190 --> 02:56:25.375]  Please send Terror Storm to number one at Amazon.com.
[02:56:25.455 --> 02:56:25.876]  God bless.
