[00:00:05.707 --> 00:00:06.367]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.028 --> 00:00:08.108]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.789 --> 00:00:09.909]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:11.370]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.111 --> 00:00:12.991]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.011 --> 00:00:17.354]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.874 --> 00:00:21.996]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:23.537 --> 00:00:31.122]  We've got Colonel Craig Roberts joining us who worked the Oklahoma City bombing case and has documented
[00:00:32.043 --> 00:00:46.550]  Now, police officer Terrence Yankee, Yankee, cop of the year, was murdered by federal forces, tortured to death for exposing and trying to expose the fact that Oklahoma City was an inside job.
[00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:47.911]  He'll be joining us in 30 minutes.
[00:00:47.971 --> 00:00:53.333]  It's a big controversy now in Oklahoma City because other police officers and others are going public.
[00:00:53.713 --> 00:00:58.676]  Now we have General Benton K. Parton joining us in the second hour to talk about the New World Order program.
[00:01:00.718 --> 00:01:11.609]  In the meantime, one of our regulars, chief CIA analyst assigned to the White House for over eight years for Ronald Reagan and George Bush Sr., confronted Rumsfeld yesterday.
[00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:14.972]  The establishment responded as they normally do.
[00:01:15.272 --> 00:01:19.536]  They even began to arrest him, to drag him out, but Rumsfeld said, no, don't do it.
[00:01:19.877 --> 00:01:21.839]  McGovern was confronting him on lies.
[00:01:22.339 --> 00:01:24.822]  We'll play that clip when we get back from the break.
[00:01:24.862 --> 00:01:33.550]  Then we'll go to a previous clip of Rumsfeld on Face the Nation where he tried to lie and say that he'd never claimed that Iraq had WMDs.
[00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:41.418]  And then an unbelievable clip concerning the White House memo yesterday afternoon when Ray McGovern then showed up on Anderson Cooper's
[00:01:43.414 --> 00:01:51.945]  Program 360 and talked about the White House memo where Bush talked about how he was going to stage the discovery of WMDs and more.
[00:01:52.065 --> 00:01:56.611]  So, the truth really breaking big time with good old-fashioned activism.
[00:01:56.951 --> 00:02:01.617]  Ray McGovern standing up during Rumsfeld's speech and calling him a liar.
[00:02:02.992 --> 00:02:03.852]  And that's what he is.
[00:02:03.912 --> 00:02:13.817]  We need to physically confront these individuals, and by physically I mean physically be there and verbally get in their face and let them know we're not going to let them go to war with Iran.
[00:02:14.217 --> 00:02:18.199]  If they are, they're going to have to drag us kicking and screaming, literally.
[00:02:19.048 --> 00:02:35.823]  And then of course there's another clip we've got concerning torture, a clip out of Tennessee that made international headlines where the fella, when the police broke into his house, started secretly recording them and there are the police torturing him to sign the search warrant, to sign an agreement allowing them to search.
[00:02:37.044 --> 00:02:42.169]  A form that would have given them authorization to do so as they were trying to frame him.
[00:02:43.507 --> 00:02:51.132]  So this is the type of information we'll be covering today as we attempt to route out corruption and expose the New World Order.
[00:02:52.332 --> 00:02:56.095]  The case of Terence Yakey is just amazing.
[00:02:57.035 --> 00:03:11.304]  Sergeant Terence Yakey, top of the year, while other police and BATF were running in fear, he ran into the still burning and smoldering OKC building and hauled out personally himself quite a few people
[00:03:12.708 --> 00:03:17.022]  And then of course he talked to BATF that day who admitted they've been warned not to go in.
[00:03:17.443 --> 00:03:19.730]  He saw them removing the unexploded bombs.
[00:03:20.606 --> 00:03:22.787]  And he was talking to his partner the night he was killed.
[00:03:22.827 --> 00:03:25.748]  He said, I'm being followed by some feds, by the FBI.
[00:03:26.708 --> 00:03:30.469]  They know that I've got material in this storage building.
[00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:32.610]  My evidence files are there.
[00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:33.850]  I've been told to get off the case.
[00:03:34.371 --> 00:03:36.971]  And then he was pulled over a few miles away from there.
[00:03:37.552 --> 00:03:38.232]  He was taken.
[00:03:38.292 --> 00:03:38.912]  He was bound.
[00:03:38.972 --> 00:03:40.252]  He was stabbed 13 times.
[00:03:40.292 --> 00:03:43.313]  He was tortured severely and then shot in the back of the head.
[00:03:43.333 --> 00:03:46.414]  And I know most police love it when cops get killed.
[00:03:46.535 --> 00:03:47.795]  I understand that.
[00:03:48.522 --> 00:03:50.484]  You love it when the illegal aliens kill you.
[00:03:50.804 --> 00:03:52.865]  You love it when other feds kill you.
[00:03:53.226 --> 00:03:53.846]  You love it.
[00:03:53.906 --> 00:03:55.047]  You love being slaves.
[00:03:55.067 --> 00:03:56.668]  You love buying into the system.
[00:03:57.128 --> 00:03:58.750]  Okay, I'm being a little bit sarcastic.
[00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:05.895]  The point is, is that you'll get real upset when some regular scumbag kills a cop, but the feds kill cops all the time.
[00:04:07.134 --> 00:04:15.339]  And of course, Colonel Craig Roberts himself, a police officer who worked the case, has been threatened as well to shut up or he's going to be in big trouble.
[00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:19.482]  And he's just told them that they can go to Hades, basically.
[00:04:20.282 --> 00:04:25.946]  So he'll be joining us because on the anniversary of his murder, coming up Monday, there's going to be a big event in Oklahoma City.
[00:04:26.627 --> 00:04:31.910]  And so we're going to have Colonel Roberts on about his letter to the police chief and a lot more.
[00:04:32.953 --> 00:04:37.034]  So you definitely, definitely want to join us for that.
[00:04:37.494 --> 00:04:40.875]  Up on InfoWars.com, we are posting Colonel Craig Roberts' letter.
[00:04:40.895 --> 00:04:44.576]  He, of course, is also the best-selling author of One Shot, One Kill.
[00:04:44.596 --> 00:04:50.017]  He was a Marine Corps sniper in Vietnam and then a colonel in the U.S.
[00:04:50.157 --> 00:04:51.157]  Army and Intelligence.
[00:04:51.777 --> 00:04:56.058]  And, of course, a police officer, SWAT team commander, police helicopter pilot.
[00:04:56.879 --> 00:04:58.779]  Basically, he's the bionic man.
[00:05:02.651 --> 00:05:05.493]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[00:05:05.753 --> 00:05:07.334]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[00:05:07.674 --> 00:05:12.357]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[00:05:12.698 --> 00:05:19.442]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[00:05:19.762 --> 00:05:21.742]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has arisen.
[00:05:21.943 --> 00:05:24.783]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[00:05:24.863 --> 00:05:29.544]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[00:05:29.744 --> 00:05:34.145]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[00:05:34.385 --> 00:05:41.607]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that is sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[00:05:41.847 --> 00:05:44.268]  Discover the documentary for yourself before it's too late.

[00:06:02.412 --> 00:06:05.436]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[00:06:05.777 --> 00:06:14.588]  It's portable and requires no water pressure so you can enjoy healthy drinking water whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[00:06:14.909 --> 00:06:19.595]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[00:06:20.055 --> 00:06:26.780]  The Berkelot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[00:06:27.161 --> 00:06:38.950]  It also removes foul taste and odors, like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals, like lead and mercury, while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:43.894]  The Berkey Light's rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.

[00:07:18.729 --> 00:07:18.989]  I think so.
[00:07:36.115 --> 00:07:42.661]  And believe strongly that the American people need alternative sources of information in order to understand the society they live in today.
[00:07:42.861 --> 00:07:45.904]  You won't find a better selection of books or videos anywhere.

[00:07:56.814 --> 00:07:57.395]  Box 281 Wildwood PA 15091
[00:08:02.805 --> 00:08:08.830]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:12.472]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:13.773 --> 00:08:23.841]  General Benton K. Parton, former head of Air Force Weapons Development, also ran the HAARP Project, wrote some of the pivotal papers on the phony Soviet-Communist-Chinese split.
[00:08:23.901 --> 00:08:26.883]  He's exposed the Pentagon's new map as a total fraud.
[00:08:26.923 --> 00:08:28.745]  He'll be joining us to expose the globalist
[00:08:29.105 --> 00:08:53.838]  Program and how it ties into the Communist Third International in the second and third hour today for 30 minutes we'll be joined by Colonel Craig Roberts coming up talking about the murder of a police officer clearly by the feds concerning the Oklahoma City bombing and the expose that's now breaking in the mainstream news in Oklahoma City and remembrance on the anniversary of his murder coming up on Monday so that's coming up in about 25 minutes
[00:08:55.874 --> 00:08:58.955]  This broadcast is the organic response to the New World Order.
[00:08:58.975 --> 00:09:02.817]  We are the grassroots result of their attack on this republic.
[00:09:02.977 --> 00:09:10.421]  We are the American people engaging in the Info War at point-blank range against the globalists, and we're not backing down.
[00:09:10.441 --> 00:09:13.222]  We're having great successes thanks to you, so God bless you.
[00:09:13.742 --> 00:09:18.064]  Okay, Ray McGovern, another prominent individual from the government who is now standing up.
[00:09:18.104 --> 00:09:27.228]  Ray McGovern, Chief CIA Analyst assigned to the White House for more than eight years in Ronald Reagan's administration and George Herbert Walker Bush gave them their morning briefing for six years.
[00:09:28.909 --> 00:09:33.811]  Yeah, for six years and then for two years was another level of doing analyst work.
[00:09:33.851 --> 00:09:35.712]  But the point is, that's all side issues.
[00:09:36.112 --> 00:09:41.955]  He confronted Rumsfeld, the Defense Secretary, yesterday
[00:09:43.312 --> 00:09:55.439]  And he brought up the fact that Rumsfeld lied about WMDs being in Iraq, and Rumsfeld lied again and said, no, I never said that, when he said it over a hundred times.
[00:09:55.499 --> 00:09:57.880]  Even the mainstream news has reported on that.
[00:09:57.920 --> 00:09:59.301]  We've played many clips of that.
[00:09:59.641 --> 00:10:00.982]  So we're going to roll that clip.
[00:10:01.042 --> 00:10:03.943]  And they began to drag him out, physically putting their hands on him.
[00:10:04.263 --> 00:10:08.986]  They did drag some of the other, quote, hecklers out and bruised them up quite a bit.
[00:10:09.386 --> 00:10:14.190]  Back when Bush was Governor, I raised the CFR and Federal Reserve to him at the end of a speech.
[00:10:14.250 --> 00:10:16.092]  It was supposedly going to be a press conference.
[00:10:16.452 --> 00:10:20.896]  I was there for a local radio station, KJFK, and they kidnapped me for about an hour.
[00:10:21.297 --> 00:10:22.358]  Almost broke my arm.
[00:10:22.378 --> 00:10:24.139]  In fact, my shoulder still hurts from it.
[00:10:24.219 --> 00:10:30.585]  I wake up in the middle of the night and I roll over wrong and I'm in searing pain in my rotator cup.
[00:10:31.586 --> 00:10:34.328]  And of course, we have a video clip of that up on the site as well.
[00:10:34.388 --> 00:10:38.651]  And all over the country, they have these vetted, staged town hall meetings.
[00:10:38.671 --> 00:10:39.992]  This was supposedly open to the public.
[00:10:40.333 --> 00:10:42.574]  And then they arrest people and drag them out when this happens.
[00:10:42.855 --> 00:10:49.440]  But Rumsfeld knew it would be embarrassing, so he didn't have Ray McGovern, top CIA analyst, drug out.
[00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:52.602]  But he used his classic gangster jokes about it.
[00:10:52.622 --> 00:10:53.943]  You're getting a lot of attention, buddy.
[00:10:54.264 --> 00:10:55.545]  So let's go ahead and roll that.
[00:10:56.185 --> 00:11:04.330]  At the Atlanta History Museum, not far from downtown, he's talking to the Southern Center for International Studies, and of course, within the speech came a few protesters.
[00:11:05.611 --> 00:11:09.473]  We don't want to hear it!
[00:11:09.493 --> 00:11:13.376]  So I would like to ask you to be upfront with the American people.
[00:11:13.856 --> 00:11:20.881]  Why did you lie to get us into a war that was not necessary and that has caused these kinds of casualties?
[00:11:20.981 --> 00:11:21.201]  Why?
[00:11:22.006 --> 00:11:24.047]  Well, first of all, I haven't lied.
[00:11:24.487 --> 00:11:25.688]  I did not lie then.
[00:11:35.033 --> 00:11:37.314]  Colin Powell didn't lie.
[00:11:39.235 --> 00:11:48.700]  He spent weeks and weeks with the Central Intelligence Agency people and prepared a presentation that I know he believed was accurate.
[00:11:49.762 --> 00:11:52.323]  And he presented that to the United Nations.
[00:11:53.323 --> 00:11:56.484]  The President spent weeks and weeks with the Central Intelligence people.
[00:11:57.104 --> 00:12:00.045]  And he went to the American people and made a presentation.
[00:12:00.225 --> 00:12:01.966]  I'm not in the intelligence business.
[00:12:03.266 --> 00:12:07.148]  They gave the world their honest opinion.
[00:12:08.168 --> 00:12:12.909]  It appears that there were not weapons of mass destruction there.
[00:12:13.330 --> 00:12:14.430]  You said you knew where they were.
[00:12:15.487 --> 00:12:16.027]  I did not.
[00:12:16.087 --> 00:12:24.091]  I said I knew where suspect sites were, and we were just... You said you knew where they were, near Tikrit, near Baghdad, and north, east, south, and west of there.
[00:12:24.212 --> 00:12:25.912]  Those are your words.
[00:12:25.972 --> 00:12:31.595]  My words... My words were that... No, no, no.
[00:12:31.635 --> 00:12:32.556]  Wait a minute, wait a minute.
[00:12:32.596 --> 00:12:33.696]  Let him stay one second.
[00:12:34.137 --> 00:12:34.717]  Just a second.
[00:12:35.998 --> 00:12:42.621]  This is America, huh?
[00:12:42.641 --> 00:12:44.322]  You're getting plenty of play, sir.
[00:12:45.575 --> 00:12:46.796]  I'd just like an honest answer.
[00:12:46.816 --> 00:12:47.677]  I'm giving it to you.
[00:12:47.697 --> 00:12:53.821]  We're talking about lies and your allegation that there was bulletproof evidence of ties between Al-Qaeda and Iraq.
[00:12:53.901 --> 00:12:54.641]  Was that a lie?
[00:12:54.661 --> 00:12:55.742]  Or were you misled?
[00:12:56.182 --> 00:13:01.026]  Zarqawi was in Baghdad during the pre-war period.
[00:13:01.846 --> 00:13:02.667]  That is a fact.
[00:13:05.197 --> 00:13:10.059]  Zarqawi, he was in the north of Iraq in a place where Saddam Hussein had no rule.
[00:13:10.299 --> 00:13:11.159]  That's where he was.
[00:13:11.279 --> 00:13:12.700]  He was also in Baghdad.
[00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:14.440]  Yeah, when he needed to go to the hospital.
[00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:16.201]  Come on, these people aren't idiots.
[00:13:16.261 --> 00:13:17.101]  They know the story.
[00:13:19.062 --> 00:13:23.263]  You are... Let me give you an example.
[00:13:23.583 --> 00:13:25.204]  It's easy for you to make a charge.
[00:13:27.186 --> 00:13:37.770]  But why do you think that the men and women in uniform, every day, when they came out of Kuwait and went into Iraq, put on chemical weapon protective suits?
[00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:40.671]  Because they liked the style?
[00:13:40.751 --> 00:13:42.231]  Because there were chemical weapons used!
[00:13:42.251 --> 00:13:45.912]  They honestly believed that there were chemical weapons.
[00:13:46.372 --> 00:13:49.933]  Saddam Hussein had used chemical weapons on his own people previously.
[00:13:49.994 --> 00:13:51.914]  He'd used them on his neighbor, the Iranians.
[00:13:52.414 --> 00:13:54.475]  And they believed he had those weapons.
[00:13:54.895 --> 00:13:56.876]  We believed he had those weapons.
[00:13:57.076 --> 00:13:58.697]  That's what we call a non sequitur.
[00:13:58.717 --> 00:14:00.238]  It doesn't matter what the troops believe.
[00:14:00.258 --> 00:14:01.498]  It matters what you believe.
[00:14:01.558 --> 00:14:03.279]  I think Mr. Secretary, the debate is over.
[00:14:03.299 --> 00:14:04.100]  We have other questions.
[00:14:04.420 --> 00:14:06.421]  Courtesy to the audience.
[00:14:06.601 --> 00:14:06.981]  Okay.
[00:14:08.042 --> 00:14:08.422]  Alright.
[00:14:08.782 --> 00:14:09.642]  Now, let's go over the points.
[00:14:09.682 --> 00:14:10.543]  Let me just be clear.
[00:14:11.223 --> 00:14:14.084]  McGovern went to the microphone during questions.
[00:14:14.585 --> 00:14:21.188]  Now, the other people that got drug out and did get arrested and did get bruised and beat up, and that's in the news, they were heckling.
[00:14:21.861 --> 00:14:23.823]  But this is an important point.
[00:14:24.003 --> 00:14:30.950]  Notice that they were already putting their hands on him for saying something that they didn't like.
[00:14:31.030 --> 00:14:32.051]  The security guards.
[00:14:32.511 --> 00:14:34.513]  The CNN security guards.
[00:14:34.553 --> 00:14:35.794]  This is the mindset.
[00:14:36.295 --> 00:14:46.965]  And then it's now been reported by mainstream Atlanta papers that some of the people in the crowd were grabbing on the hecklers themselves and shoving them down to the ground.
[00:14:47.580 --> 00:14:50.643]  So it looks like the injuries came from fellow citizens.
[00:14:50.963 --> 00:14:57.349]  It's just like when that Chinese-American doctor confronted the butcher of Beijing, President Hu, the dictator.
[00:14:57.629 --> 00:15:00.051]  People were grabbing on her and trying to cover her mouth.
[00:15:00.151 --> 00:15:01.112]  Other cameramen.
[00:15:01.612 --> 00:15:02.974]  This is what America has become.
[00:15:03.034 --> 00:15:04.435]  The cops don't even need to do it.
[00:15:04.915 --> 00:15:07.357]  Now, in fact, normally the police don't act like this.
[00:15:07.418 --> 00:15:12.262]  It's the security guards and the citizens, like a bunch of Nazis, grabbing on people.
[00:15:13.966 --> 00:15:16.247]  Notice that McGovern says, oh yeah, this is America.
[00:15:16.287 --> 00:15:17.308]  This is what America is.
[00:15:17.348 --> 00:15:20.449]  You can hear him say that whenever they start grabbing on him.
[00:15:20.489 --> 00:15:21.890]  And then Rumsfeld says, no, no, no.
[00:15:22.210 --> 00:15:22.890]  Leave him alone.
[00:15:23.230 --> 00:15:32.414]  By the way, of course, at that time in the Reagan administration, and then again in the Bush senior administration, Ray McGovern was at the same level of Rumsfeld.
[00:15:32.655 --> 00:15:33.555]  They know each other.
[00:15:33.915 --> 00:15:35.577]  They went to school together.
[00:15:35.837 --> 00:15:37.559]  Ray's been on and talked about that.
[00:15:37.599 --> 00:15:39.100]  So here it is.
[00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:42.223]  That's why Rumsfeld was so uncomfortable.
[00:15:42.323 --> 00:15:45.206]  I mean these guys have quote been friends in the past.
[00:15:45.246 --> 00:15:49.590]  Ray McGovern is extremely prominent and he's just lying.
[00:15:50.031 --> 00:15:51.052]  This is what he does.
[00:15:51.072 --> 00:15:53.894]  These people are congenital liars.
[00:15:54.275 --> 00:15:55.456]  Let's go ahead and roll the clip.
[00:15:55.476 --> 00:15:58.479]  Later that afternoon they got Ray McGovern on CNN.
[00:15:58.539 --> 00:15:58.799]  Roll it.
[00:16:00.623 --> 00:16:03.065]  That's CNN with the bad audio.
[00:16:03.105 --> 00:16:03.946]  Go ahead and roll it.
[00:16:03.986 --> 00:16:10.611]  When he says, as he did just yesterday, that there was an organized campaign of manipulation of the intelligence to prove a tie between Iraq and Al-Qaeda,
[00:16:26.944 --> 00:16:33.889]  The objective, of course, is to make the American people think that Saddam Hussein has something to do with 9-11.
[00:16:33.969 --> 00:16:42.175]  When Pilar comes out with that information, then I think we need to make sure the American people know that we knew at that time there was no such tie.
[00:16:42.496 --> 00:16:46.398]  He didn't answer or respond to the bulletproof question at first.
[00:16:46.419 --> 00:16:55.045]  You asked basically, you reiterated the bulletproof and said, you know, the heat indicator was bulletproof evidence of a link between Al-Qaeda and Saddam Hussein's government.
[00:16:55.625 --> 00:17:04.952]  He then came back to it, though, and said, well, it's a fact that Zarqawi was in Iraq, and you pointed out that he... Well, what did you say then?
[00:17:05.692 --> 00:17:15.939]  Well, you know, I was so glad that he disingenuously offered that, because Zarqawi was not under any al-Qaeda or Saddam Hussein control.
[00:17:16.259 --> 00:17:19.381]  He was in the northern part of Iraq, where no one held sway.
[00:17:19.501 --> 00:17:21.623]  Not Saddam Hussein, certainly not al-Qaeda.
[00:17:22.143 --> 00:17:22.263]  Yes.
[00:17:38.864 --> 00:17:45.169]  Is above the fray and he believes that the audience and most of the audience there today of course was fits this mold.
[00:17:45.529 --> 00:17:47.151]  They won't question him on these things.
[00:17:47.371 --> 00:17:48.712]  Who knows these details?
[00:17:48.972 --> 00:17:49.673]  Well, we know them.
[00:17:50.093 --> 00:17:50.333]  Why?
[00:17:50.673 --> 00:18:02.703]  Because it was our profession to follow such details and we used to be able to apply our techniques and our tradecraft to foreign leaders and it's ironic in the extreme that we need to do media analysis
[00:18:03.804 --> 00:18:11.650]  How can you prove, though, a lie?
[00:18:11.730 --> 00:18:26.843]  I mean, you're alleging an intent to mislead, a belief that they knew there was no MWMD, that they knew Saddam wasn't really an imminent threat, and they chose to go to war anyway, and they faked, they manipulated, they hand-picked intelligence.
[00:18:27.263 --> 00:18:31.167]  Others will argue, you know, they, maybe they, you know,
[00:18:32.107 --> 00:18:37.689]  They believed they had it, and so they looked for intelligence that matched their belief, but they actually did believe it.
[00:18:38.430 --> 00:18:53.236]  We have the minutes of his discussions with Tony Blair, the British Prime Minister, on the 31st of January 2003, where the President says, there really aren't any weapons of mass destruction to be found, but we need some way to make this war.
[00:18:53.716 --> 00:18:56.117]  Maybe, yeah, that's a good idea, maybe we'll paint
[00:18:56.577 --> 00:18:57.118]  We're good to go.
[00:19:14.830 --> 00:19:26.514]  Where the head of British intelligence came back from consultations with George Tenet in July of 2002 and said, uh, the intelligence and the facts are being fixed around the policy.
[00:19:27.274 --> 00:19:32.056]  The evidence on, uh, on ties between Saddam Hussein and 9-11.
[00:19:32.096 --> 00:19:34.097]  Okay, that's what we're really talking about.
[00:19:34.117 --> 00:19:41.739]  69% of the American people believe that Saddam Hussein had something to do with 9-11 when it went to war with Iraq.
[00:19:42.119 --> 00:19:44.160]  That was exactly what the administration wanted.
[00:19:45.138 --> 00:19:52.326]  Alright folks, when I was watching that clip, I said, I hope McGovern brings up Downing Street and White House memo, and he did exactly that.
[00:19:52.706 --> 00:19:58.652]  We have them dead to rights, lying to Congress, lying to the American people to take us to war.
[00:19:58.872 --> 00:19:59.453]  It's treason!
[00:20:02.614 --> 00:20:11.699]  Now you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as triamethylenes, atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and MTBE to below detectable limits.
[00:20:11.939 --> 00:20:23.164]  Black Flurky elements are so powerful, they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[00:20:23.504 --> 00:20:28.327]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum,
[00:20:28.547 --> 00:20:29.247]  are no problem.
[00:20:29.467 --> 00:20:36.110]  Foul tastes like chlorine and obnoxious sulfur odors are removed without removing the healthful and beneficial minerals that your body needs.
[00:20:36.330 --> 00:20:43.153]  Black Berkey elements flow one and a half to two times faster than ordinary gravity elements, which means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[00:20:43.413 --> 00:20:45.194]  Supercharge your gravity filter today.
[00:20:45.454 --> 00:20:47.495]  Upgrade to Black Berkey purification elements.

[00:21:54.305 --> 00:22:04.728]  On February 29, 1892, the United States of America's Supreme Court declared us a Christian nation.
[00:22:13.206 --> 00:22:22.869]  However, over recent years, for the last three decades, there's been a deliberate war on Christianity in America to wipe out our heritage from the minds of our people.
[00:22:23.769 --> 00:22:30.410]  The First Amendment to the Constitution guarantees us religious freedom, and yet it's under attack today.

[00:23:03.522 --> 00:23:07.687]  You drive up to the pump only to find that the price per gallon is up once again.
[00:23:08.027 --> 00:23:12.573]  If you want to save money at the pump and get back in the driver's seat, then listen closely.

[00:24:10.407 --> 00:24:11.288]  We're not going to air all of them.
[00:24:11.328 --> 00:24:11.748]  We don't have time.
[00:24:11.768 --> 00:24:13.449]  We've got a guest coming up, Colonel Craig Roberts.
[00:24:15.511 --> 00:24:23.117]  But we've got Rumsfeld saying on Meet the Press, this is Face the Nation I'm about to play, that it's an urban legend.
[00:24:24.558 --> 00:24:25.559]  He said urban legend.
[00:24:25.599 --> 00:24:27.421]  He never said they had WMDs.
[00:24:27.441 --> 00:24:30.143]  He said it again over a hundred times.
[00:24:30.983 --> 00:24:32.985]  So let's go ahead and roll Face the Nation.
[00:24:33.005 --> 00:24:37.489]  This is from two years ago when he was already saying that he'd never said that.
[00:24:37.529 --> 00:24:37.829]  Here it is.
[00:24:40.964 --> 00:24:42.205]  Well, let me just ask you this.
[00:24:43.046 --> 00:24:51.892]  If they did not have these weapons of mass destruction, though, granted all of that is true, why then did they pose an immediate threat to us, to this country?
[00:24:52.533 --> 00:24:57.457]  You and a few other critics are the only people I've heard use the phrase immediate threat.
[00:24:57.617 --> 00:24:57.937]  I didn't.
[00:24:58.177 --> 00:24:58.958]  The President didn't.
[00:24:59.788 --> 00:25:03.969]  And it's become kind of folklore that that's what's happened.
[00:25:04.490 --> 00:25:07.971]  The President went... You're saying that nobody in the administration said that?
[00:25:08.071 --> 00:25:11.612]  I can't speak for everybody in the administration and say nobody said that.
[00:25:11.632 --> 00:25:13.032]  The Vice President didn't say that?
[00:25:13.052 --> 00:25:17.654]  If you have any citations, I'd like to see them.
[00:25:17.754 --> 00:25:25.476]  Some have argued, this is you speaking, some have argued that the nuclear threat from Iraq is not imminent, that Saddam is at least five to seven years away from having nuclear weapons.
[00:25:25.736 --> 00:25:26.957]  I would not be so certain.
[00:25:30.236 --> 00:25:35.421]  Well, I've tried to be precise and I've tried to be accurate.
[00:25:35.461 --> 00:25:36.001]  I'm sorry.
[00:25:36.021 --> 00:25:43.127]  Will a terrorist state pose a greater or more immediate threat to the security of our people and the stability of the world and the regime of Saddam Hussein in Iraq?
[00:25:46.050 --> 00:25:54.358]  My view of the situation was that he had, we believe, the best intelligence that we had and other countries had.
[00:25:55.572 --> 00:26:00.275]  They created a fake intelligence department to put out false intelligence.
[00:26:00.315 --> 00:26:00.995]  That's now admitted.
[00:26:01.015 --> 00:26:05.117]  We have the memos where they said they were going to frame Saddam Hussein.
[00:26:05.577 --> 00:26:07.458]  And I don't want to hear, oh, you're defending Saddam Hussein.
[00:26:08.019 --> 00:26:11.861]  No, our government created him as usual and set him up and ran the whole thing.
[00:26:12.401 --> 00:26:14.182]  The point is, is they lied.
[00:26:14.282 --> 00:26:15.863]  They lied premeditatedly.
[00:26:16.143 --> 00:26:17.684]  That is a serious crime.
[00:26:18.524 --> 00:26:19.505]  And that clip is nothing.
[00:26:19.906 --> 00:26:23.851]  I'm making a new film that is about the Iraq War, the London bombing, and a bunch of other issues.
[00:26:24.332 --> 00:26:27.416]  We've got so many clips we have to decide what to leave in and what to take out.
[00:26:27.777 --> 00:26:35.147]  Where Rumsfeld and Rice and Powell and the Defense Secretary, all of them, Bush,
[00:26:36.147 --> 00:26:36.508]  Cheney.
[00:26:36.528 --> 00:26:40.130]  They all sit up there and say we know they have WMDs.
[00:26:40.190 --> 00:26:41.450]  We know they're going to use them.
[00:26:41.811 --> 00:26:42.731]  A mushroom cloud.
[00:26:42.751 --> 00:26:44.292]  They can kill us in 45 minutes.
[00:26:44.552 --> 00:26:45.793]  You all remember that.
[00:26:45.853 --> 00:26:46.913]  It's all part of the record.
[00:26:47.113 --> 00:26:48.634]  But they say it's an urban legend.
[00:26:48.674 --> 00:26:49.835]  They say it's folklore.
[00:26:50.135 --> 00:26:51.676]  They use this talking point.
[00:26:53.637 --> 00:26:55.478]  Then there's the whole other area of free speech.
[00:26:56.299 --> 00:27:01.041]  Ray McGovern was up at the microphone for his question and they were about to arrest him or detain him or drag him out.
[00:27:01.281 --> 00:27:04.263]  They did do that to other people who were heckling.
[00:27:05.234 --> 00:27:24.571]  But here's a clip from my film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement, this is the end of the film, where back in 98, then Governor Bush, at the end of his speech, it was a prepared speech, we have the text of it, and he was supposed to have a press conference, they cancelled that right before his speech and said no press conference, so I'd been there for the press conference, I asked my question at the end, here it is, I got kidnapped for this!
[00:27:25.652 --> 00:27:29.155]  The victory will be in politics as far as I'm concerned.
[00:27:30.076 --> 00:27:32.758]  The victory will be an endorsement of a philosophy.
[00:27:34.102 --> 00:27:38.824]  I believe in my heart of hearts the victory in 1998 is going to be good for Texas.
[00:27:39.064 --> 00:27:41.746]  And that's the most important thing about the campaign.
[00:27:42.846 --> 00:27:45.427]  Sir, shouldn't we abolish the Federal Reserve and the CFR?
[00:27:46.048 --> 00:27:49.049]  That's the real reality that none of you will talk about and most of you are members.
[00:27:49.709 --> 00:27:51.490]  That's what's destroying this country, Governor.
[00:27:53.571 --> 00:27:55.012]  Don't you stand for America, sir?
[00:27:55.632 --> 00:27:57.493]  What about the Federal Reserve and the CFR?
[00:27:58.934 --> 00:28:00.174]  You people are being lied to.
[00:28:00.214 --> 00:28:01.655]  This country's been taken over by Europe.
[00:28:02.155 --> 00:28:02.976]  And I'm being drugged out.
[00:28:03.136 --> 00:28:03.676]  Laugh at it!
[00:28:10.877 --> 00:28:17.667]  Go ahead and bring me back up.
[00:28:26.295 --> 00:28:39.761]  And on top of it, again I had the microphone there in my hand so I was able to catch what happened on tape and then Mike Hanson followed me out with a video camera and was able to shoot video of my kidnapping.
[00:28:39.821 --> 00:28:41.042]  No charges, no nothing.
[00:28:41.442 --> 00:28:52.267]  Drove me around for about an hour and then just pulled me over on the side of the highway and put me out basically on the Travis County-Williamson County line.
[00:28:52.327 --> 00:28:55.749]  Just exited the highway, brought me over and dropped me off.
[00:28:56.649 --> 00:28:58.390]  Without my car keys, without anything.
[00:28:58.510 --> 00:28:59.690]  I mean, this is America.
[00:29:00.210 --> 00:29:01.590]  And it happened to Alan Keyes.
[00:29:01.630 --> 00:29:05.991]  Remember back in the 96 Republican debates in the primaries?
[00:29:06.611 --> 00:29:09.452]  And he was scheduled on the debate commission debate roster.
[00:29:09.892 --> 00:29:12.233]  And the Republican leadership decided they didn't want him there.
[00:29:13.013 --> 00:29:15.273]  And so they had him kidnapped for over an hour.
[00:29:15.313 --> 00:29:19.794]  And they took him and threw him out in a crack-infested neighborhood in the major city where they were having it.
[00:29:19.894 --> 00:29:22.135]  So, there's a lot of different issues here.
[00:29:22.845 --> 00:29:24.366]  And it shows the mindset.
[00:29:24.747 --> 00:29:32.733]  And they've charged the American doctor, the Chinese-American doctor, who confronted Hu with a terrorism charge of intimidating a foreign official.
[00:29:32.753 --> 00:29:36.016]  And she's facing, what, six months to a year in federal prison.
[00:29:36.076 --> 00:29:38.298]  She'll lose her Second Amendment rights, everything.
[00:29:38.358 --> 00:29:44.664]  They're throwing the book at her for, during that press conference, standing up and disrupting what they were doing.
[00:29:45.324 --> 00:29:47.326]  We'll be right back with Colonel Craig Roberts.
[00:29:51.886 --> 00:29:54.890]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.811 --> 00:29:58.494]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.239 --> 00:30:02.839]  We're good to go.
[00:30:22.824 --> 00:30:24.166]  Are you still barely having enough money?
[00:30:24.326 --> 00:30:27.790]  Are you tired of working so hard yet feeling like you'll never get ahead?
[00:30:28.070 --> 00:30:31.855]  Are you ready to start investing in your own business instead of somebody else's?
[00:30:32.115 --> 00:30:37.102]  Whatever it is you seek, Zango could be the special company that helps you achieve your hopes and dreams.
[00:30:37.362 --> 00:30:39.044]  So take matters into your own hands.
[00:30:39.304 --> 00:30:43.306]  Create a future that doesn't depend on a fickle 401k and lateral promotions.
[00:30:43.546 --> 00:30:45.407]  Dango is what you are looking for.
[00:30:45.567 --> 00:30:50.129]  Find out more by calling 888-203-6633 or visit MangosteenMarkets.com.

[00:31:02.262 --> 00:31:07.488]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[00:31:07.628 --> 00:31:15.738]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[00:31:15.978 --> 00:31:23.046]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[00:31:23.226 --> 00:31:24.487]  Radioactive Poisoning.
[00:31:24.567 --> 00:31:30.471]  Potassium Iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[00:31:30.651 --> 00:31:35.755]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[00:31:35.855 --> 00:31:44.721]  Potassium Iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick and pets.
[00:31:45.001 --> 00:31:48.304]  Order the official Potassium Iodate for only $24 and save $5.
[00:31:50.405 --> 00:31:50.886]  We're good to go!
[00:32:14.195 --> 00:32:17.199]  Because many people have high blood pressure for years without knowing it.
[00:32:17.499 --> 00:32:20.282]  The American Heart Association calls it the silent killer.
[00:32:20.563 --> 00:32:24.247]  At ResearchedHerbs.com, we recognize your concern for your well-being.

[00:32:54.642 --> 00:32:54.842]  That's 1-800-845-3841.
[00:33:09.216 --> 00:33:15.545]  Alright, we're going to shift gears and get into the murder of a valiant police officer, the type of officers we need in this country.
[00:33:15.565 --> 00:33:17.547]  He was the model of that and he was brutally killed.
[00:33:17.567 --> 00:33:22.074]  We're trying to expose the Oklahoma City cover-up, the government involvement.
[00:33:22.094 --> 00:33:23.776]  We'll go to Colonel Craig Roberts here in just one moment.
[00:33:24.887 --> 00:33:27.509]  Before I do that, hey, the ball is in your court, folks.
[00:33:27.570 --> 00:33:29.411]  Defeating the New World Order is up to you.
[00:33:30.052 --> 00:33:40.782]  I can put the information out, I can make the films, I can bring you all these important guests, these great Americans, or people worldwide who are fighting tyranny in the global crime syndicate, but it's up to you.
[00:33:40.842 --> 00:33:43.264]  We're not going to have an effect unless you take action.
[00:33:43.844 --> 00:33:52.210]  And I authorize you, I encourage you, I beg you, I plead with you to get my documentary films and to make copies of them for non-profit educational purposes.
[00:33:53.230 --> 00:33:54.892]  To make as many copies as you can.
[00:33:54.932 --> 00:33:57.593]  Make a copy every night when you go to bed or burn copies on your computer.
[00:33:58.054 --> 00:34:05.739]  Whatever is best for you and to give them to police, firefighters, pastors, rabbis, imams, whatever.
[00:34:06.299 --> 00:34:09.081]  People who can influence populations in your area.
[00:34:10.310 --> 00:34:11.690]  We're in the information war.
[00:34:11.710 --> 00:34:13.791]  We're having a great effect against the New World Order.
[00:34:14.091 --> 00:34:16.331]  They're trying to shut down and regulate the web right now.
[00:34:16.391 --> 00:34:17.532]  It's very serious.
[00:34:17.932 --> 00:34:19.632]  They're shutting down AXS TV.
[00:34:20.032 --> 00:34:24.113]  They're moving to shut down our avenues because we have been effective.
[00:34:24.493 --> 00:34:28.634]  Believe me, we're in a toe-to-toe, 12th round, heavyweight championship fight.
[00:34:28.994 --> 00:34:31.055]  Both sides are bleeding, are bloodied.
[00:34:31.395 --> 00:34:32.755]  We've got our eyes swole shut.
[00:34:33.256 --> 00:34:35.316]  And we've got them on the ropes, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:34:35.836 --> 00:34:38.097]  We can win this thing, but we're not out of the woods.
[00:34:38.137 --> 00:34:39.257]  We're in deep trouble, too.
[00:34:40.350 --> 00:34:47.212]  So it's up to you to exert that force in the Infowars and to go to Infowars.com and get Martial Law, my new 9-11 film.
[00:34:47.493 --> 00:34:48.453]  Get The Order of Death.
[00:34:48.513 --> 00:34:49.493]  Get Road to Tyranny.
[00:34:50.193 --> 00:34:53.375]  Get 9-11 Synthetic Terror by Webster Tarpley.
[00:34:53.395 --> 00:34:57.436]  Get the new video I'm carrying that's amazing, Secret Mysteries of America's Beginnings, Volume 1.
[00:34:57.756 --> 00:34:58.376]  It's incredible.
[00:35:00.037 --> 00:35:07.520]  We've got a bunch of discounts and specials on the online video and bookstore at Infowars.com right now, so take advantage of those while those specials are still up there.
[00:35:07.540 --> 00:35:08.640]  We're about to change them again.
[00:35:09.534 --> 00:35:12.657]  So please go to InfoWars.com and get as many videos as you can.
[00:35:12.717 --> 00:35:13.758]  That's how you support us.
[00:35:14.198 --> 00:35:15.900]  You can just consider that a donation to us.
[00:35:16.240 --> 00:35:17.181]  That's how we operate.
[00:35:17.201 --> 00:35:18.202]  We're trying to expand.
[00:35:18.482 --> 00:35:19.703]  We're really having an effect.
[00:35:19.763 --> 00:35:25.388]  I know of no other organization, no other, that with the resources we have does as much as we do.
[00:35:26.009 --> 00:35:32.295]  We are basically like special forces soldiers behind enemy lines engaging in a real live InfoWar.
[00:35:32.315 --> 00:35:33.776]  In fact, there's no basic about it.
[00:35:34.415 --> 00:35:36.477]  Now, this is a serious fight.
[00:35:36.517 --> 00:35:37.858]  We take it seriously.
[00:35:38.238 --> 00:35:42.342]  We work long hours because we know our family's futures are in the balance.
[00:35:42.382 --> 00:35:45.865]  So again, InfoWars.com or call toll-free.
[00:35:45.885 --> 00:35:49.788]  They can tell you about all the titles and what the films cover and the books and how to order them.
[00:35:49.808 --> 00:35:50.709]  You can do it over the phone.
[00:35:50.729 --> 00:35:51.329]  1-888-253-3139.
[00:35:51.369 --> 00:35:51.690]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:35:51.710 --> 00:35:52.570]  Or write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001.
[00:36:04.199 --> 00:36:07.883]  South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[00:36:08.424 --> 00:36:10.866]  General Benton K. Partin joins us in about 24 minutes.
[00:36:10.966 --> 00:36:15.511]  I'm going to go ahead and go to our guest, who is Colonel Craig Roberts.
[00:36:15.531 --> 00:36:21.658]  We've got a big announcement, a huge announcement, coming up at the bottom of the hour in the third hour.
[00:36:23.279 --> 00:36:34.202]  In about an hour and a half from now, just a huge announcement that, or a little more over an hour and a half from now, a huge announcement that's really important and is going to have a big effect against the Globalists.
[00:36:34.262 --> 00:36:35.323]  Be sure and tune in for that.
[00:36:35.343 --> 00:36:40.864]  You know, I feel like I should read his letter, but he's got to go out of town so he can't stay with us in the next hour.
[00:36:40.884 --> 00:36:47.226]  I feel like I should read his letter, and so if the Colonel will just hold there, I'm going to read this letter as quickly as possible.
[00:36:48.993 --> 00:36:57.838]  But then I want to get to him so he can tell you the story of what really happened in a nutshell and how you can support this murdered officer's family and all other officers who are under the threat of federal extermination.
[00:36:57.858 --> 00:36:59.599]  There have been a lot of cops killed by these people.
[00:37:00.740 --> 00:37:04.222]  Colonel Craig Roberts wrote this on May 1st to the police chief.
[00:37:05.503 --> 00:37:08.825]  It says, Chief William City, Oklahoma City Police Department.
[00:37:10.346 --> 00:37:13.628]  I'm a retired Tulsa police officer, says dear City Chief.
[00:37:15.683 --> 00:37:23.107]  I am a retired Tulsa police officer who was assigned by our department to assist the FBI in working on the OKC bombing case.
[00:37:23.567 --> 00:37:26.208]  I retired in 1996 for 27 years of service.
[00:37:26.649 --> 00:37:39.015]  One of the reasons the Tulsa office of the FBI requested me to assist on the case was that I had contacts and sources that they did not have access to and they felt that I might be able to develop leads and contacts that would assist with the investigation.
[00:37:39.515 --> 00:37:43.818]  My extra job was working as an investigative journalist, and I had several books to my credit.
[00:37:43.878 --> 00:37:44.819]  Best sellers, by the way.
[00:37:44.839 --> 00:37:52.064]  The request came from the FBI to our Chief's office, Chief Ron Palmer, on April 21st, 1995, two days after the bombing.
[00:37:52.504 --> 00:38:05.733]  I spent several months working on the case and found many discrepancies in the investigation that made me determine that the whole story would never be told, and that things were being ignored or covered up that let others unknown escape the investigation.
[00:38:06.884 --> 00:38:08.145]  And he goes through it.
[00:38:08.325 --> 00:38:16.893]  One instance that I found extremely disturbing and very upsetting and suspect was the death of one of your officers, Sergeant Terrence Yakey.
[00:38:17.453 --> 00:38:24.560]  There are too many discrepancies surrounding his death, which I will outline below, and let the case simply gather dust in the archives.
[00:38:25.808 --> 00:38:28.509]  Again, he said, when I hurry up, I butcher this stuff.
[00:38:28.789 --> 00:38:35.031]  There are too many discrepancies surrounding this death, which I will outline below, to let the case simply gather dust in the archives.
[00:38:35.071 --> 00:38:36.752]  And it goes on for several pages.
[00:38:37.152 --> 00:38:38.352]  He goes through bullet points.
[00:38:38.712 --> 00:38:40.853]  Perhaps he can just do that in his own words now.
[00:38:41.333 --> 00:38:42.954]  Colonel Roberts, thanks for joining us.
[00:38:42.994 --> 00:38:49.496]  You've been the champion exposing this for many years now, what, over a decade, his brutal murder.
[00:38:49.996 --> 00:38:54.338]  And now it's really starting to break in Oklahoma, and a lot of people are standing up.
[00:38:54.378 --> 00:38:55.218]  So thank you for joining us.
[00:38:55.718 --> 00:38:56.939]  Always glad to be back, Alex.
[00:38:57.720 --> 00:39:03.646]  You know, they're going to have a rally on Monday in Oklahoma City, right across the street from the police station.
[00:39:04.326 --> 00:39:07.489]  Anybody who wants to come, they'll be glad to have you.
[00:39:07.649 --> 00:39:13.455]  The actual address is on the letter, which is now on my website, so if anybody wants to go read the whole letter,
[00:39:14.225 --> 00:39:26.035]  Go to www.RifleWarrior.com, scroll down to the letter to the Oklahoma City Police Chief, and you can go over there and read the entire letter, and get to all the little points that I point out in the letter.
[00:39:26.075 --> 00:39:38.246]  But anyway, on Monday, the Oklahoma City Bombing Investigation Commission is putting together a press conference, and they're going to have some of the relatives of Terry Yackey there, and they're going to have a
[00:39:38.979 --> 00:39:46.242]  A little get-together to try to get the Oklahoma City Police Department to reopen this case, now that they're into their third police chief since the Oklahoma City bombing.
[00:39:46.423 --> 00:40:00.169]  Now for those that don't know about this case, tell us about this amazing American, I mean, just a model officer, and we've got a photo up on Infowars.com of him charging out of the building, saving people, and he saw some things that morning that turned him on to the truth.
[00:40:00.549 --> 00:40:01.330]  Break it down for us.
[00:40:01.710 --> 00:40:04.771]  Well, Terry Yakey was either the first or second officer in the building.
[00:40:04.811 --> 00:40:08.313]  He was only a couple of blocks away when the explosives went off.
[00:40:09.202 --> 00:40:09.522]  I don't know.
[00:40:21.840 --> 00:40:27.862]  You know, in the process of recovering from a back injury, and he even hurt himself even further doing this, trying to pull people out.
[00:40:27.902 --> 00:40:28.682]  He was a great big guy.
[00:40:28.702 --> 00:40:29.642]  He was like six foot two.
[00:40:29.662 --> 00:40:32.683]  Yeah, he looked like a big NFL linebacker.
[00:40:32.703 --> 00:40:34.864]  You can tell he's in a lot of pain in the photos.
[00:40:34.884 --> 00:40:35.904]  You can see it on his face.
[00:40:36.144 --> 00:40:42.666]  Yeah, he just really put himself out, but the problem was what he saw on that day that didn't escape his attention.
[00:40:43.406 --> 00:40:47.287]  We think that he saw some explosives that were still attached to columns in the building.
[00:40:48.068 --> 00:40:49.148]  We know he saw
[00:40:50.049 --> 00:40:57.815]  Other federal agents in SWAT gear there within minutes of the explosion as if they were already dressed up and had the building staked out.
[00:40:58.095 --> 00:41:08.944]  He found out later that they did have foreknowledge of the case and he was building this case and going back to his police department trying to say hey guys if we had done this you know they would have hung us up to dry.
[00:41:09.480 --> 00:41:13.644]  If we let it, you know, if we run a stakeout and let a crime occur, and then try to say we weren't even there.
[00:41:13.664 --> 00:41:19.790]  So he was working that case, and because of that, he started getting hammered by his own police department.
[00:41:19.810 --> 00:41:25.076]  His own chain of command told him, leave it alone, walk away from it, you don't want to be there, it's a federal deal.
[00:41:25.276 --> 00:41:27.238]  By the way, he was the cop of the year that year.
[00:41:27.258 --> 00:41:29.080]  He was the police officer of the year that year.
[00:41:29.540 --> 00:41:32.203]  He was a sergeant, and a patrol officer downtown.
[00:41:33.161 --> 00:41:47.649]  And so he started hooking up with some of the survivors in the weeks following the bombing and getting with them and saying, guys, you know, I saw stuff and this is what I saw and we need to write it down and we need to work together on this and try to get to the bottom of this because something's just not right.
[00:41:47.669 --> 00:41:48.710]  There's a cover-up going on.
[00:41:49.470 --> 00:41:58.375]  As he was doing this, he continued to get hammered from people in his own chain of command, including his own chaplain on the police department who tried to warn him off the case.
[00:41:59.022 --> 00:42:02.044]  During this period of time, he was going through a divorce with his wife.
[00:42:02.365 --> 00:42:07.128]  He had an apartment, which got broken into, and all of his doors were gone through.
[00:42:07.509 --> 00:42:09.210]  His car had been broken into twice.
[00:42:09.270 --> 00:42:13.093]  He started keeping the evidence he was gathering in files and in his briefcase.
[00:42:14.014 --> 00:42:28.765]  And finally, one day came, at which, in March of 1996, or I'm sorry, just about a year later, the day came that he decided he better hide these files and get this stuff out of his apartment, or they're going to disappear, or something's going to happen to them.
[00:42:29.460 --> 00:42:33.862]  He wanted to upgrade his life insurance.
[00:42:33.902 --> 00:42:41.706]  He wrote a letter to his ex-wife, Tanya, saying, hey, if anything happens to me, I want you to have all my stuff, and so on and so forth.
[00:42:42.226 --> 00:42:46.848]  So he started to leave town that day, and he called a friend of his, and he said, look, we're going to have dinner tonight.
[00:42:47.548 --> 00:42:50.870]  But what's going to happen is I've got to go by the police station.
[00:42:50.890 --> 00:42:53.832]  They're going to chew my rear out again and tell me to get off the case.
[00:42:54.012 --> 00:42:55.993]  And he even named who he was going to see.
[00:42:56.013 --> 00:43:04.058]  And then he was going to leave there and go out to Yukon, or El Reno, and we're not sure which, which is a town west of Oklahoma City where he grew up.
[00:43:04.458 --> 00:43:06.420]  And he had a little mini-storage out there someplace.
[00:43:06.480 --> 00:43:11.743]  And he was going to take his files and stuff and put them out there to get away from Oklahoma City.
[00:43:12.607 --> 00:43:15.770]  And he told his friend, he said, there's two feds in a white car.
[00:43:15.950 --> 00:43:19.313]  Now, we don't know why he thought that they were feds, but that's what he said.
[00:43:19.753 --> 00:43:20.794]  He says, they're following me.
[00:43:21.014 --> 00:43:26.619]  He says, I'll shake them after I leave the police department, I'll go take this stuff out to the storage, and I'll be back and we'll have dinner.
[00:43:26.639 --> 00:43:27.560]  Well, he never came back.
[00:43:28.901 --> 00:43:36.227]  The next morning, they found him in a field not far from the El Reno Federal Reformatory.
[00:43:36.267 --> 00:43:37.027]  They found his body.
[00:43:37.608 --> 00:43:39.069]  And they found, what had happened first,
[00:43:39.682 --> 00:43:48.187]  Was that Canadian County Deputy Sheriff, which is a county just west of Oklahoma City, on patrol had come across a car on the road, abandoned.
[00:43:48.567 --> 00:43:50.568]  And they looked in the car and they saw blood in the car.
[00:43:51.049 --> 00:43:53.150]  Then they found some razor blades laying on the ground.
[00:43:53.690 --> 00:43:57.312]  And then it looked like some kind of foul play had happened.
[00:43:57.332 --> 00:44:01.595]  So they started looking around and they ended up searching this field and they found his body out in the field.
[00:44:01.895 --> 00:44:03.016]  Now here's the strange part.
[00:44:05.574 --> 00:44:15.199]  When they got to the medical examiner's office, first, they didn't find any gun at the scene until an hour after the Oklahoma City Police Department and the FBI showed up, which was later, about 9 o'clock in the morning.
[00:44:15.699 --> 00:44:17.000]  And then they found a gun.
[00:44:17.040 --> 00:44:20.621]  We still don't know what kind of gun they found, but that's allegedly when they found the gun.
[00:44:20.982 --> 00:44:22.983]  But if you'll go to my website at riflewarrior.com,
[00:44:24.261 --> 00:44:28.565]  And you go to the letter of the Oklahoma City Police Department.
[00:44:28.585 --> 00:44:35.510]  I've got a link in there that will take you to Who Killed Terry Yakey and you scroll down to the bottom that has the autopsy diagrams and you can see for yourself.
[00:44:35.610 --> 00:44:40.835]  And just so you know, Colonel, we're linking to that right now on Infowars.com directly to those subpages.
[00:44:40.875 --> 00:44:41.155]  Go ahead.
[00:44:41.315 --> 00:44:41.595]  Great.
[00:44:41.855 --> 00:44:47.320]  And the one on Who Killed Terry Yakey, if you go down to the bottom, you see the autopsy
[00:44:47.794 --> 00:44:54.841]  Diagrams, or actually they didn't do an autopsy, the medical examiner just did diagrams of the wounds on his body, and this is what's important.
[00:44:56.543 --> 00:44:59.947]  He had 16, I think, cut wounds on his body.
[00:45:00.427 --> 00:45:06.533]  He had 3 or 4 inside of each wrist, 2 or 3 inside of each elbow, and both jugular veins slashed.
[00:45:07.034 --> 00:45:08.896]  He had rope marks around his neck.
[00:45:09.335 --> 00:45:20.361]  He had handcuff marks on his hand, he'd been beaten up, and most of all he had a gunshot, a small caliber gunshot, from above his right temple down through the bottom of his left cheek.
[00:45:20.701 --> 00:45:27.005]  Now no one, if they're going to shoot themselves, takes a gun, holds it up in the air, points it down, and fires at a 45 degree downward angle.
[00:45:27.665 --> 00:45:33.188]  On top of that, it was such a small caliber that it made a small exit hole.
[00:45:33.248 --> 00:45:35.810]  There wasn't that much damage done physically to the body.
[00:45:36.587 --> 00:45:41.552]  But there was no, hardly anything, but a little bit of gunpowder soot on the entrance wound.
[00:45:41.592 --> 00:45:47.477]  And any officer out there, anybody that's ever worked a gunshot on a contact wound knows that if you just take a pistol...
[00:45:48.223 --> 00:45:48.483]  I think so.
[00:46:09.845 --> 00:46:11.847]  The only time there isn't any is if you use a silencer.
[00:46:11.867 --> 00:46:13.788]  Because a silencer absorbs most of the gases.
[00:46:36.667 --> 00:46:44.934]  And if you look at those diagrams, it tells you that there's a contact barrel imprint on the skin.
[00:46:45.234 --> 00:46:46.675]  So you know it was a contact wound.
[00:46:48.676 --> 00:46:51.058]  It's just so obvious what this was.
[00:46:51.098 --> 00:46:52.139]  He'd been followed.
[00:46:52.519 --> 00:46:53.780]  He'd been taken out of his car.
[00:46:54.701 --> 00:46:55.462]  He'd been beaten up.
[00:46:55.722 --> 00:46:56.503]  He'd been slashed.
[00:46:56.523 --> 00:46:57.183]  He'd been tortured.
[00:46:57.203 --> 00:46:58.244]  He'd been drunk through his field.
[00:46:58.692 --> 00:47:06.734]  And they finally ended up, you know, he had to be down on his knees with somebody standing to his right side pointing a gun down through his head and pulling the trigger.
[00:47:06.774 --> 00:47:08.054]  And by the way, he was tough.
[00:47:08.154 --> 00:47:11.255]  I mean, as much as they cut him, it looked like he was hard to kill.
[00:47:11.915 --> 00:47:18.336]  Oh yeah, this guy, he was one big muscle-bound guy and there would have been a heck of a fight.
[00:47:18.376 --> 00:47:21.537]  It would have taken more than one person to do this, or at least two if not more.
[00:47:21.737 --> 00:47:26.358]  It's clear they pulled guns on him, put him in handcuffs, took him and tortured him.
[00:47:27.358 --> 00:47:28.879]  Now, who do you think did it?
[00:47:28.899 --> 00:47:33.322]  I mean, he's a trained police officer, obviously looked like an unmarked car, white car following.
[00:47:34.082 --> 00:47:35.603]  Colonel, you've been researching this for years.
[00:47:35.644 --> 00:47:36.564]  Who do you think killed him?
[00:47:37.044 --> 00:47:40.207]  Well, basically, you would have to remember... Special Forces Detachment or something?
[00:47:40.487 --> 00:47:41.427]  Well, no, you know what?
[00:47:42.048 --> 00:47:46.611]  I've developed my own theory on this over the years, but we have to remember, this was during the Clinton administration.
[00:47:47.271 --> 00:47:51.715]  And in the Clinton administration, a lot of people got killed.
[00:47:51.915 --> 00:47:58.901]  And people within that administration were known in the law enforcement community to have connections with what they call the Northwest Arkansas Mafia.
[00:47:59.741 --> 00:48:05.686]  Now, they aren't real mafia, but it's the Northwest Arkansas criminal, drug-running, money-laundering bunch.
[00:48:05.766 --> 00:48:07.107]  Well, it's really the state police.
[00:48:07.908 --> 00:48:10.110]  There were some state police involved in this.
[00:48:10.170 --> 00:48:11.751]  There were private individuals involved.
[00:48:11.771 --> 00:48:14.914]  There were former CIA spooks involved from the Iran-Contra affair.
[00:48:15.658 --> 00:48:21.220]  So, if there was a clique that went around and took care of Clinton's laundry, that's where it would have come from.
[00:48:22.420 --> 00:48:29.702]  Now, you've got guys out there that are, you know, they, back in the Hoover days, they had an organization they called the Squad.
[00:48:29.942 --> 00:48:37.624]  And Hoover could personally, you know, pick up the phone and say, we need to get rid of this guy, he's a communist, or he's a threat to the Bureau, or something like that, and they just went out and did it.
[00:48:38.764 --> 00:48:40.645]  I think that those organizations are still out there.
[00:48:41.355 --> 00:48:46.718]  And, you know, I mean, we have too many professional hits that do not get investigated and they don't get investigated.
[00:48:46.758 --> 00:48:52.140]  These guys must really feel, I mean, we know they're scum, but I mean, killing cops, they're just, they're filth.
[00:48:52.260 --> 00:48:52.900]  Oh, they don't care.
[00:48:53.020 --> 00:48:54.381]  They have no souls.
[00:48:54.461 --> 00:48:59.903]  They have no, uh, uh, uh, problem with, with, with killing anybody.
[00:48:59.923 --> 00:49:05.506]  They're like a trained dog, you know, they're, they're like a pit bull and they don't have any problem with attacking or killing anybody.
[00:49:06.064 --> 00:49:11.545]  And I think that that's who's used by some of these globalists to eliminate problems when they get too overbearing, like you and me.
[00:49:12.745 --> 00:49:18.726]  Well, I know you've been threatened, I've been threatened, I've been physically assaulted, but I like that story you tell about your granddaddy before you went to Vietnam.
[00:49:18.746 --> 00:49:19.286]  Tell that again.
[00:49:20.006 --> 00:49:29.248]  Well, I was sitting on the front porch getting ready to go to Vietnam as a young Marine, and my grandfather was a primitive Baptist preacher in the Smoky Mountains in East Tennessee, just an old country preacher in a wooden church.
[00:49:30.028 --> 00:49:34.129]  And he was sitting in the rocking chair and he's whittling, and I was sitting on the steps looking at the mountains, and he said,
[00:49:34.594 --> 00:49:37.375]  You know, son, you're getting ready to go off to that Vietnam place, ain't you?
[00:49:37.395 --> 00:49:38.035]  And I said, yes, sir.
[00:49:38.575 --> 00:49:41.256]  He said, well, them Vietnam boys are going to be trying to kill you, aren't they?
[00:49:41.316 --> 00:49:41.976]  And I said, yes, sir.
[00:49:42.716 --> 00:49:44.757]  He said, well, you don't have nothing to worry about.
[00:49:45.137 --> 00:49:45.997]  And I said, why is that?
[00:49:46.157 --> 00:49:47.858]  He says, good Lord calls you home.
[00:49:47.878 --> 00:49:48.618]  You can't stop it.
[00:49:48.778 --> 00:49:50.338]  And if he ain't ready, no one can rush it.
[00:49:51.078 --> 00:49:52.299]  And that's the way I've lived my life.
[00:49:52.339 --> 00:49:56.720]  And I've managed to go through Vietnam, the police department, flying helicopters and cancer, and I'm still here.
[00:49:57.993 --> 00:49:58.613]  Absolutely.
[00:49:58.713 --> 00:50:04.135]  So many people are just captured by fear, and we're going to be slaves if we let fear rule over us.
[00:50:04.575 --> 00:50:12.597]  And we need to take the memory of Terence Yankee, this murdered officer, and make sure that Oklahoma City is exposed, so his sacrifice is in vain.
[00:50:13.177 --> 00:50:21.139]  Well, we need to take every Achilles' heel on every, the 9-11 case, this case, the Pentagon crash, I mean, everything that we find, TW800,
[00:50:22.865 --> 00:50:27.969]  The Amtrak derailment, all the cases I talk about, the Medusa file, the POW MIA situation.
[00:50:28.069 --> 00:50:31.892]  Every time we catch them lying, we need to do one thing and that's not ignore it.
[00:50:31.932 --> 00:50:36.035]  We need to stand up, get in their face and start barking and just go on the attack.
[00:50:36.235 --> 00:50:37.356]  Always be on the attack.
[00:50:37.376 --> 00:50:39.518]  Never be on the defensive and never be complacent.
[00:50:40.393 --> 00:50:41.653]  We're completely surrounded.
[00:50:41.773 --> 00:50:42.114]  Good.
[00:50:42.774 --> 00:50:43.994]  Don't let any of them escape.
[00:50:44.714 --> 00:50:46.315]  We got them where we want them.
[00:50:46.455 --> 00:50:46.755]  Yeah.
[00:50:47.255 --> 00:50:47.995]  Final segment.
[00:50:48.035 --> 00:50:51.436]  We'll talk about the rally coming up Monday and a little bit more about this case.
[00:50:51.456 --> 00:50:52.837]  We're going to have you on for two hours.
[00:50:53.157 --> 00:50:55.097]  In the next few weeks, Colonel, stay with us.
[00:50:55.117 --> 00:50:59.939]  Then we got General Benton K. Parton coming on to talk about the communist program of control.
[00:51:02.580 --> 00:51:05.522]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[00:51:06.182 --> 00:51:07.463]  Alex Jones here, America.
[00:51:07.663 --> 00:51:13.407]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest and most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[00:51:13.687 --> 00:51:18.950]  In 2 hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solutions.
[00:51:19.230 --> 00:51:23.394]  Brace yourselves as the New World Order program for world domination is blown wide open.
[00:51:23.554 --> 00:51:27.337]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world where the military and the police are merged.
[00:51:27.598 --> 00:51:32.242]  Witnesses populations beg for national ID cards and yes, even implantable microchips.
[00:51:32.342 --> 00:51:35.104]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies.
[00:51:35.404 --> 00:51:38.587]  Psychotic UN population control plans and much, much more.
[00:51:38.627 --> 00:51:40.449]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.

[00:51:56.974 --> 00:51:58.494]  Order today and spread the word.
[00:51:58.654 --> 00:52:00.735]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.
[00:52:02.243 --> 00:52:05.826]  Do you know where the 78 potentially active volcanoes in the U.S.
[00:52:05.847 --> 00:52:06.367]  are located?
[00:52:06.567 --> 00:52:09.950]  And do you know the locations of the top 300 prime terrorist targets?
[00:52:10.190 --> 00:52:14.894]  You can find these answers and more in the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA.
[00:52:15.175 --> 00:52:20.179]  With the more than 50 interactive parameters, you can pinpoint natural and man-made disaster areas.
[00:52:20.339 --> 00:52:21.019]  We're good to go.
[00:52:40.247 --> 00:52:41.088]  We're good to go.
[00:53:03.368 --> 00:53:03.708]  I think so.
[00:53:18.599 --> 00:53:19.260]  We're good to go!
[00:53:48.118 --> 00:53:51.221]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[00:53:51.381 --> 00:53:57.347]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[00:54:06.495 --> 00:54:08.457]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:54:08.897 --> 00:54:11.660]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:12.606 --> 00:54:14.949]  Colonel Roberts will be with us five minutes in the next hour.
[00:54:14.969 --> 00:54:18.093]  Then we've got General Benton K. Parton, former head of Air Force Weapons Development.
[00:54:18.874 --> 00:54:21.757]  Of course, he exposed the fact that there were clearly bombs inside the building.
[00:54:21.797 --> 00:54:24.360]  Plus, we have newscasts with the cops removing them, the BATF.
[00:54:26.703 --> 00:54:27.785]  So he's joining us.
[00:54:28.145 --> 00:54:30.768]  Maybe we'll get him to talk a little bit about Oklahoma City as well.
[00:54:30.848 --> 00:54:32.030]  Clearly an inside job.
[00:54:33.211 --> 00:54:46.135]  But if I try to go over all the cases that are confirmed with indicted or convicted FBI agents and others, and other police, where in New York, Boston, Houston over the last few decades, they kill good cops.
[00:54:46.835 --> 00:54:50.096]  And normally police will freak out and run around screaming if an officer gets killed.
[00:54:50.176 --> 00:54:51.157]  Fine, I think that's good.
[00:54:51.717 --> 00:54:54.718]  But every time the feds kill a cop, and it's clear they killed a cop,
[00:54:55.929 --> 00:54:59.972]  Same thing with stuff that's happened throughout history.
[00:55:00.272 --> 00:55:02.113]  Cops just shut up and go along with it.
[00:55:02.133 --> 00:55:04.755]  There's always a few real cops that don't let go of it.
[00:55:05.395 --> 00:55:06.856]  Colonel Craig Roberts, why is that?
[00:55:06.936 --> 00:55:11.279]  Why do police, when they know the feds are killing cops, let them do it and just suck their thumbs?
[00:55:11.939 --> 00:55:15.662]  Well, I think, like in the Oklahoma City case, I talked to some of the officers down there.
[00:55:15.682 --> 00:55:18.783]  I know that they've got an entirely different kind of police department than Tulsa has.
[00:55:18.823 --> 00:55:21.105]  I think we're a little more rough and tumble up here.
[00:55:21.787 --> 00:55:32.052]  On our department, we were 700 officers strong, and if this had happened in Tulsa, I personally know of two dozen guys that would have stormed City Hall to get results, to get something done about it.
[00:55:32.072 --> 00:55:39.675]  But Oklahoma City, for some reason, when I talked to them, I met with 14 other people down there one day, and I said, how come you guys aren't just screaming and jumping up and down and raising canes?
[00:55:40.136 --> 00:55:45.738]  And they had this look of shock on their face, and they said, look, we're just trying to make retirement and get out of here.
[00:55:45.778 --> 00:55:47.779]  You don't understand what's going on in this department.
[00:55:47.799 --> 00:55:49.160]  You don't understand how bad it is.
[00:55:49.810 --> 00:55:53.012]  And, uh, you know, they will do anything to shut us up or stop us.
[00:55:53.253 --> 00:55:59.237]  Do they think their children and their grandchildren, and long after they're gone, their great-great-grandchildren, who I love as much as my children?
[00:55:59.397 --> 00:56:01.038]  They're not born yet, but I love them.
[00:56:01.859 --> 00:56:05.441]  I don't understand how they can deliver their children into a hell on earth.
[00:56:05.921 --> 00:56:09.264]  You don't have a good society, folks, when the government can blow up federal buildings.
[00:56:09.984 --> 00:56:19.331]  Well, you know, these guys, they don't know what you and I know, and they're intimidated in their own worlds, you know, of dealing with the police department, their families, and that's about all they do.
[00:56:20.157 --> 00:56:31.709]  And that, you know, to them, to the guys I was talking to that were, you know, they were concerned about it and they wanted me to expose it because there's nothing their chief or their administration or their city manager could do to me because I didn't work for them and they didn't sign my paycheck.
[00:56:32.373 --> 00:56:38.959]  I was their only outlet and they were doing what they could to get the information out and help me out as much as they could without them being hammered.
[00:56:39.559 --> 00:56:42.482]  You know, there's no saying that the nail that sticks up gets the hammer.
[00:56:42.502 --> 00:56:45.284]  Well, I've always stuck up and I've always got hammered and it doesn't bother me.
[00:56:45.605 --> 00:56:48.507]  But, you know, these guys aren't like you and me.
[00:56:48.547 --> 00:56:49.768]  They don't fix bayonets and charge.
[00:56:49.808 --> 00:56:51.270]  Instead, they dig the foxhole deeper.
[00:56:51.850 --> 00:56:53.171]  And that happens all over the country.
[00:56:53.612 --> 00:56:55.674]  You know, police are just a cross-section of society.
[00:56:55.694 --> 00:56:58.316]  You've got the good, you've got the 10% that are bad, and then you've got
[00:56:59.089 --> 00:57:02.791]  Uh, the majority that are pretty much indifferently me alone, I just want to do my job.
[00:57:03.271 --> 00:57:11.735]  And that's, you know, uh, there's as many cops that sit on the couch and watch TV and don't do anything else but play golf or something as there are, you know, civilians out here.
[00:57:12.136 --> 00:57:18.799]  The problem, or the issue is, uh, how come there aren't more guys like me on third apartment because I didn't find any?
[00:57:19.498 --> 00:57:27.867]  The only two that I ran into retired shortly after the bombing and have now become more involved and more vocal since the Chief has changed.
[00:57:27.887 --> 00:57:36.256]  But they had a Chief Gonzales at the time, and trying to work through him didn't do any good because he was tied in tight with Bob Ricks and Governor Keating.
[00:57:37.017 --> 00:57:38.418]  He was replaced by M.T.
[00:57:39.039 --> 00:57:41.982]  Berry, who was obviously
[00:57:42.734 --> 00:57:45.155]  Uh, you know, bought and paid for by the, by the administration.
[00:57:45.195 --> 00:57:55.681]  He's now the city manager of Oklahoma City, and he's the one that, when I wrote the original letter several years ago asking to reopen the case, wrote me a one-pager back that, you know, pretty much mind your own business and go away.
[00:57:55.861 --> 00:58:00.503]  And by the way, you've had the FBI come and investigate you and try to set you up.
[00:58:01.284 --> 00:58:03.945]  Oh, I've had, I've had, yeah, my house was under surveillance.
[00:58:03.985 --> 00:58:04.585]  I was followed.
[00:58:04.625 --> 00:58:05.526]  My phones were tapped.
[00:58:06.709 --> 00:58:07.329]  It was great fun.
[00:58:07.349 --> 00:58:09.350]  Yeah, I had dead animals on my front porch.
[00:58:09.450 --> 00:58:17.832]  And then you wrote a book about a helicopter and then they tried to do a terrorism investigation claiming your book was a terror plant.
[00:58:18.092 --> 00:58:27.734]  I wrote a book called Hellhound that had to do with an Iraqi helicopter pilot that had a high-tech helicopter that was going to blow up a nuclear power plant in California.
[00:58:27.834 --> 00:58:28.634]  Avon produced it.
[00:58:28.654 --> 00:58:30.555]  You can find it on eBay and usedbooks.com.
[00:58:31.850 --> 00:58:35.771]  And, uh, somebody at a ball game was talking to a, uh... Stay there, stay there.
[00:58:35.811 --> 00:58:38.432]  We'll be... We'll be right back with Colonel Craig Roberts.
[00:58:38.452 --> 00:58:40.252]  Quick five-minute segment, then General Parton.

[00:58:46.634 --> 00:58:46.734]  Hello?
[00:58:46.754 --> 00:58:47.054]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.295 --> 00:59:00.336]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:01.056 --> 00:59:02.157]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.818 --> 00:59:03.638]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.399 --> 00:59:05.299]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.320 --> 00:59:09.823]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.143 --> 00:59:14.266]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:15.987 --> 00:59:22.152]  We've been talking about the murder of Oklahoma City
[00:59:23.402 --> 00:59:32.887]  Police Department Sergeant Terrence Yakey, who was cop of the year, police officer of the year for saving so many people in the building, saw the BATF and their bomb gear, their SWAT gear.
[00:59:33.448 --> 00:59:36.349]  They told firefighters and others, yeah, we got a warning not to come in that day.
[00:59:36.389 --> 00:59:40.812]  They tried to order doctors and others to dress wounds that didn't exist to claim they'd been in the building.
[00:59:41.502 --> 00:59:42.143]  I'm not sure.
[00:59:42.203 --> 00:59:43.624]  I think it's 11 o'clock in the morning.
[00:59:43.764 --> 00:59:46.887]  I'm not part of it since it's 150 miles away.
[01:00:01.501 --> 01:00:02.282]  It will be tomorrow.
[01:00:02.582 --> 01:00:05.203]  But you're the guy that's been exposing this from day one.
[01:00:05.523 --> 01:00:09.345]  I've been trying real hard and I've got some other people finally interested in it.
[01:00:09.405 --> 01:00:11.847]  We've even got a lawyer involved looking at the case.
[01:00:13.648 --> 01:00:14.608]  It's not going to go away.
[01:00:15.869 --> 01:00:25.574]  The administration of Oklahoma City is going to have to figure out and until a lot of these questions are answered satisfactorily, it's going to come back over and over again and it can be something that can really hurt them.
[01:00:26.345 --> 01:00:28.006]  Well, we're going to post the time and date.
[01:00:28.067 --> 01:00:37.635]  We actually have the flyer right here, and we're going to have Mr. Emory on at the very end of the show, one of the organizers, to plug it properly.
[01:00:38.035 --> 01:00:41.939]  Just in closing here, we're going to have you up again in a few weeks, and we're always honored to have you, Colonel.
[01:00:42.319 --> 01:00:43.480]  Good friend of mine, personally.
[01:00:44.546 --> 01:00:46.647]  I believe we're starting to beat the New World Order.
[01:00:46.687 --> 01:00:49.728]  Ten years ago I was really pessimistic, but I'm seeing so many victories.
[01:00:49.788 --> 01:00:54.030]  It's kind of like you plant the crops in the spring and there's lots of rain and lots of sun.
[01:00:54.330 --> 01:01:00.053]  Well, the tyrannies, the rain, and the abuse of the people and the corruption is the sun and rain.
[01:01:00.573 --> 01:01:03.054]  And people are really starting to wake up right now.
[01:01:04.155 --> 01:01:07.136]  Number one, do you agree with that analysis or add anything to it?
[01:01:07.176 --> 01:01:12.078]  And then number two, what do you see happening in the next few years as they try to accelerate their program?
[01:01:12.518 --> 01:01:26.666]  Yeah, I agree, and it reminds me of the movie Zulu, about the battle at Rorke's Drift, where you had 150 Welsh infantry up against 4000 Zulus, and they held out for three days, and then the Zulus ended up just turning around and going home.
[01:01:28.047 --> 01:01:40.955]  This isn't going to end up with anybody turning around and going home, but it just goes to show what a few determined people who are going to stand their ground can do to massive odds, and I think the globalists are finding out right now that
[01:01:41.363 --> 01:01:49.894]  You know, this path that they're going down isn't an easy one, and it's full of bins, and the trail, and it's uphill, and there's a lot of ambushes along the way, and the troops are starting to rally.
[01:01:52.034 --> 01:01:57.519]  I mean, we've talked privately driving along down the highway about how ten years ago your fellow police officers laughed at you.
[01:01:57.559 --> 01:02:00.142]  Now you said it's like selling snow cones in hell, basically.
[01:02:00.522 --> 01:02:06.188]  Oh yeah, it's, you know, I've got calls from guys that, I've been retired ten years now, and they said, you know, you were just way ahead of your time.
[01:02:06.208 --> 01:02:08.050]  We're just learning what you were trying to say back then.
[01:02:08.070 --> 01:02:10.712]  We thought you were crazy, and now we just know you're ahead of your time.
[01:02:10.752 --> 01:02:14.416]  And so that makes you feel kind of good that, you know, you get a little vindicated toward the end.
[01:02:15.242 --> 01:02:24.525]  But I think that's one of the most powerful things we have in our arsenal in the Infowar, using the truth, they use lies, is that we're able to predict and diagram, because we know the program.
[01:02:24.545 --> 01:02:25.365]  We've got the road map.
[01:02:25.385 --> 01:02:26.165]  It's not that hard.
[01:02:26.405 --> 01:02:28.486]  People think we've got crystal balls or tea leaves.
[01:02:28.946 --> 01:02:30.207]  That's not really the case, is it, Colonel?
[01:02:30.607 --> 01:02:31.087]  No, it isn't.
[01:02:31.107 --> 01:02:38.469]  And you link this up to prophecy in the Bible, and you link it up to when you understand that these people are satanic and luciferian.
[01:02:38.569 --> 01:02:41.430]  I mean, you're talking the bohemian crowd bunch and all the rest of them.
[01:02:41.914 --> 01:02:46.475]  These people actually think that Satan is the guy that's going to give them all the power and that's what they're banking on.
[01:02:47.016 --> 01:02:53.998]  And I don't think they read the Bible the same way as everybody else when you read the book of Daniel and the book of Revelation and find out where this is going.
[01:02:54.038 --> 01:02:57.539]  And you can see we're pretty much up to Revelation 13 and the mark of the beast right now.
[01:02:58.440 --> 01:03:05.022]  And the people that don't read the Bible don't understand this, and they can't see down the road what's going to happen next and how to prepare for it.
[01:03:05.342 --> 01:03:12.904]  Well, I agree, and of course I believe in God and I believe in what you're discussing, but at the same time, just from history, working for tyrannies is bad for everybody.
[01:03:13.004 --> 01:03:16.085]  Even the tyrants end up getting overthrown by their own system.
[01:03:16.125 --> 01:03:18.925]  This is just plain bad if you're a student of history.
[01:03:19.566 --> 01:03:22.246]  Well, yeah, I mean, look what happened to Hitler's henchmen.
[01:03:22.306 --> 01:03:24.567]  As soon as he took power, he got rid of all the brown shirts.
[01:03:25.351 --> 01:03:31.512]  I mean, the same thing happened in Vietnam when they got rid of the Viet Cong, and so on and so forth.
[01:03:31.612 --> 01:03:38.433]  Stalin, China, Cuba... And Ben Parton can really go into that, he knows a lot.
[01:03:38.453 --> 01:03:40.054]  When you talk to Ben, say hi for me, will you?
[01:03:40.314 --> 01:03:40.754]  I will.
[01:03:41.134 --> 01:03:42.914]  Colonel Craig Roberts, we'll talk to you real soon.
[01:03:43.074 --> 01:03:43.494]  Take care.
[01:03:43.734 --> 01:03:43.954]  Bye-bye.
[01:03:44.755 --> 01:03:47.295]  Alright, we'll be right back with General Benton K. Parton.
[01:03:47.315 --> 01:03:51.556]  The websites are InfoWars.com, InfoWars.net, and JonesReport.com.
[01:03:54.850 --> 01:03:57.713]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[01:03:57.954 --> 01:03:59.555]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[01:03:59.896 --> 01:04:04.561]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[01:04:04.901 --> 01:04:11.649]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[01:04:11.969 --> 01:04:13.951]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has arisen.
[01:04:14.151 --> 01:04:16.993]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[01:04:17.093 --> 01:04:21.737]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[01:04:21.957 --> 01:04:26.360]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[01:04:26.601 --> 01:04:33.846]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds with their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.

[01:05:53.755 --> 01:05:58.197]  If you think your engine is safe by having the oil changed every 3,000 miles, think again.
[01:05:58.457 --> 01:06:02.058]  Every time you start your car, your engine creates friction between the moving parts.
[01:06:02.198 --> 01:06:10.341]  These moving parts wear against each other, and the result is small metal particles circulating through your oil, causing premature wear and damage to your engine.
[01:06:10.581 --> 01:06:16.203]  Oil filters do a good job of trapping the large metal particles, but they will not trap the most harmful tiny particles.
[01:06:16.503 --> 01:06:21.745]  These tiny particles circulate constantly through your oil, and over time your engine begins to show signs of wear.
[01:06:22.006 --> 01:06:24.106]  This is why you need the Filter Mag.
[01:06:24.367 --> 01:06:36.512]  The Filter Mag is a powerful magnet that holds itself to the outside of your oil filter, trapping the tiny metal particles to the inside wall of the filter, extending the life of your oil and ultimately extending the life of your engine.
[01:06:36.752 --> 01:06:41.175]  The reusable FilterMag is maintenance-free, installs in two seconds, and lasts forever.
[01:06:41.395 --> 01:06:42.336]  So what are you waiting for?
[01:06:42.516 --> 01:06:44.137]  Go to FilterMag.com.
[01:06:44.257 --> 01:06:46.059]  That's FilterMag.com.
[01:06:46.319 --> 01:06:46.779]  Or call 800-345-8376.
[01:06:46.839 --> 01:06:47.019]  That's 800-345-8376.
[01:06:47.059 --> 01:06:48.140]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:06:48.160 --> 01:06:49.541]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:00.973 --> 01:07:05.075]  Waging war on corruption, crashing with lies and disinformation.
[01:07:05.115 --> 01:07:06.935]  We're the organic response.
[01:07:07.315 --> 01:07:09.176]  The American people standing up against this tyranny.
[01:07:09.216 --> 01:07:13.878]  Before we go to General Benton K. Barton who will be with us a little bit into the next hour.
[01:07:13.898 --> 01:07:14.738]  We're so honored to have him.
[01:07:15.018 --> 01:07:19.740]  Former head of Air Force Weapons Development and many other posts that he held.
[01:07:20.370 --> 01:07:22.751]  Of course, he exposed the Oklahoma City bombing and a lot more.
[01:07:22.771 --> 01:07:26.032]  He's going to be talking about the International Communist Program.
[01:07:26.092 --> 01:07:27.112]  It is a program.
[01:07:27.152 --> 01:07:27.912]  It is a map.
[01:07:27.972 --> 01:07:29.293]  It is a blueprint.
[01:07:29.673 --> 01:07:30.733]  It is being executed.
[01:07:31.153 --> 01:07:36.035]  But before we do that, I want to state for the record that I've studied communist history.
[01:07:36.235 --> 01:07:38.196]  I have studied the 20th century.
[01:07:38.296 --> 01:07:43.277]  I've studied the founding of the Communist Party before the turn of the last century.
[01:07:44.258 --> 01:07:45.738]  All of this happening.
[01:07:46.658 --> 01:07:48.859]  But General Parton knows a lot more than I do about it.
[01:07:49.446 --> 01:07:55.728]  But clearly what the old-timers wrote in the forties and fifties is exactly what's happened, proving they were right.
[01:07:55.948 --> 01:07:56.989]  Now let me add something here.
[01:07:57.469 --> 01:08:00.610]  Communism isn't what the communists tell you it is.
[01:08:00.630 --> 01:08:02.330]  This is where people get confused.
[01:08:02.891 --> 01:08:06.812]  It isn't even what our media claims it is.
[01:08:07.392 --> 01:08:13.054]  It was created from all the research I've done by large European financial interests
[01:08:13.746 --> 01:08:27.618]  That wanted to create a worldwide system to control wealth, the distribution of it, to break countries down into basically sectors that produce certain raw materials, certain countries that then put the materials together.
[01:08:28.138 --> 01:08:32.782]  I really call it modern neo-feudalism or mercantilism.
[01:08:33.063 --> 01:08:35.224]  The royals of Europe created mercantilism.
[01:08:35.545 --> 01:08:39.348]  The French did about 350 years ago, really hit its peak about 250 years ago.
[01:08:41.087 --> 01:08:48.733]  Where they would hand out licenses to certain key individuals and everybody else, so it was free market for them, then you had all these slaves under it.
[01:08:49.234 --> 01:08:55.059]  And that's why you always see David Rockefeller supporting it, or Zygmunt Brzezinski supporting it, or all these elitists supporting it.
[01:08:55.079 --> 01:09:00.683]  So the average person in the street wearing a Che Guevara shirt thinks, no, no, we're fighting the man, we're fighting the establishment.
[01:09:00.983 --> 01:09:04.006]  Well, I looked at the workers.org commie website,
[01:09:04.526 --> 01:09:16.160]  Just a few days ago, and it was saying, workers of the world unite, we're for the illegal alien, demonstrators, oh it's so great and organic and we don't recognize any colonial borders and we need to have a revolution.
[01:09:16.601 --> 01:09:18.844]  Meanwhile, it was Bush and Fox, Dallas Morning News,
[01:09:20.045 --> 01:09:26.549]  ...reported that openly hired Rob Allen & Co., a PR firm that got Bush elected, got Fox elected, to stage all these demonstrations.
[01:09:26.609 --> 01:09:34.155]  And Bush says, in his own policy papers, a CFR paper last year says, we don't recognize national borders, colonial borders.
[01:09:34.415 --> 01:09:35.435]  It's the same terms.
[01:09:35.516 --> 01:09:36.096]  Agenda 21, UN treaties.
[01:09:37.977 --> 01:09:46.423]  So, understand, the international money cartels are actually using the communist model system, which they funded to begin with, to put this in place.
[01:09:46.464 --> 01:10:03.116]  Now, I don't know if General Partin agrees with that analysis, but we have to have a paradigm shift here to understand that the dirty little guy in a foxhole who's a communist fighter, like Eric Blair or George Orwell was his pen name, he thought he was in Spain really fighting for the people against Hitler.
[01:10:03.798 --> 01:10:05.559]  Later, he learned it was all a big scam.
[01:10:06.400 --> 01:10:08.521]  So, basically, that's what we're breaking down.
[01:10:08.561 --> 01:10:10.122]  General Parton, it's great to have you with us.
[01:10:10.383 --> 01:10:10.943]  My pleasure.
[01:10:11.103 --> 01:10:12.324]  To be back on your program.
[01:10:12.584 --> 01:10:13.224]  You bet, sir.
[01:10:13.785 --> 01:10:18.148]  The statement I just made, do you agree with it, or do you disagree, or would you like to add something?
[01:10:18.368 --> 01:10:19.929]  Well, that's part of the problem.
[01:10:20.149 --> 01:10:27.374]  You didn't cover it all, but that's a good hunk of it, and surely the international banking community has had something to do with it from the very beginning.
[01:10:28.672 --> 01:10:34.354]  If you would like to get into the program of the Third International, it's not a blueprint, it's not a plan, it's a program.
[01:10:34.774 --> 01:10:35.494]  A program?
[01:10:35.574 --> 01:10:38.775]  And you've got to think of it just like a program when you go to a theater.
[01:10:39.435 --> 01:10:41.476]  When you go to a theater, they give you a program.
[01:10:41.736 --> 01:10:51.478]  You've got a cast, it's rehearsed to play, you've got people who sold tickets, you've got a theater, you've got people on the cleg lights, you've got everything there to produce that program.
[01:10:52.499 --> 01:10:56.760]  And you have to think of the program of the Third International as the same sort of thing.
[01:10:57.722 --> 01:11:19.015]  And when they set up, when the Communists took Russia in 1918, and they set up the first Soviet government in 1918, they put together another committee of their best and brightest from around the world to come up with what they called the Program of the Third International, and that's the title of the volume that they turned out.
[01:11:20.035 --> 01:11:25.759]  And those volumes that they turned out for the Program of the Third International, and you can find them
[01:11:26.428 --> 01:11:33.978]  And the documents of the Communist International edited by DeGrasse published by Oxford University Press right after the war.
[01:11:33.998 --> 01:11:37.643]  A lot of them are extracts.
[01:11:37.863 --> 01:11:40.927]  I have the major documents I have in their full
[01:11:41.548 --> 01:11:45.313]  A copy, but for the program of 30 International you only have a few paragraphs.
[01:11:57.227 --> 01:11:59.188]  Well, there are pages and pages of predictions.
[01:11:59.208 --> 01:12:01.269]  I was just extrapolating the program, where we're going to be
[01:12:25.416 --> 01:12:31.417]  And recognizing where we were at the time and where we were going to be in that document, I put together work on it.
[01:12:31.437 --> 01:12:38.939]  It was really entitled, The Sino-Soviet Conflict, Competition, and Cooperation to Risk in Force Structure Planning.
[01:12:39.739 --> 01:12:51.461]  Because at that time, the so-called Russian and Chinese conflict was a major strategic disinformation program.
[01:12:52.213 --> 01:13:08.664]  And from 1955 until around 1989, the Sino-Soviet split was the major strategic disinformation program the communist world was using to accomplish a lot of their objectives, including inverting the power balance in the world.
[01:13:08.804 --> 01:13:11.826]  Now, I know you don't like to talk about it yourself, but just tell us about General Benton K. Parton.
[01:13:12.166 --> 01:13:13.287]  Oh, Benton K. Parton?
[01:13:13.887 --> 01:13:14.227]  Okay.
[01:13:15.248 --> 01:13:17.409]  Well, I served 31 years in the Air Force.
[01:13:21.399 --> 01:13:23.940]  I had a degree in chemical engineering.
[01:13:24.921 --> 01:13:33.827]  I later went through an engineering, I flew for 25 years, but I later went through a program in armament development.
[01:13:34.847 --> 01:13:39.030]  I got a master's in aeronautical engineering out of it, but it was eight quarters normally to get a master's.
[01:13:39.050 --> 01:13:39.871]  You take three quarters.
[01:13:40.511 --> 01:13:47.596]  And I got served as the, that was the first Special Assistant in the Air Force Systems Command for Advanced Weapons Concepts.
[01:13:48.656 --> 01:13:53.786]  And I started a lot of things from there on up for the next 20 years or so.
[01:13:54.634 --> 01:13:56.736]  Managed a lot of the advanced weapons stuff.
[01:13:56.896 --> 01:13:58.797]  Yeah, a lot of it, a lot of it's still classified.
[01:13:58.817 --> 01:13:59.598]  You can't get into that.
[01:13:59.658 --> 01:14:04.861]  Well, the GPS that you have today, I started with PALS in 1971 or 72.
[01:14:06.022 --> 01:14:07.643]  Later, it was put in satellite.
[01:14:07.943 --> 01:14:10.305]  We had it in the U2R to start with.
[01:14:10.485 --> 01:14:14.108]  You also headed up the HAARP program, did you not?
[01:14:14.588 --> 01:14:19.552]  Well, I started, that was part of a focused energy weapons effort.
[01:14:19.992 --> 01:14:24.135]  And the first laser effort, I started back about the same time.
[01:14:24.642 --> 01:14:27.484]  Wrote the first contract for laser in 1958.
[01:14:28.344 --> 01:14:37.690]  I had the opportunity because I went through all that training and two years at BRL in the terminal ballistics area.
[01:14:38.370 --> 01:14:42.312]  I had a lot of training more than almost anybody else in the Air Force at the time.
[01:14:42.372 --> 01:14:48.336]  I was normally thrust into those positions and I served all the way from the laboratory up to the Office of the Secretary of Defense.
[01:14:48.948 --> 01:14:56.230]  And then after I got out, I got a White House appointment and worked in the FAA as assistant to the administrator of the FAA.
[01:14:56.970 --> 01:15:02.131]  And I did the white paper for the transition team from the Reagan to the Bush administrations.
[01:15:02.811 --> 01:15:09.933]  But anyway, I had a lot of opportunities because of all the training and growth assignments that I had in that particular area.
[01:15:10.613 --> 01:15:15.514]  But it set me up for when the thing happened in Oklahoma.
[01:15:16.358 --> 01:15:26.420]  I was flat new from all the terminal ballistics work I had done and analysis work, because any time you're trying to get a new program underway, you have to prove the cost effectiveness and it can do what you say it's going to do.
[01:15:27.061 --> 01:15:30.581]  So terminal ballistics is a very important aspect of weapons development.
[01:15:31.282 --> 01:15:37.263]  And just like the hard structure munitions for going down deep and taking care of very, very hard targets.
[01:15:37.303 --> 01:15:39.024]  So that was done back in that period of time.
[01:15:39.304 --> 01:15:40.064]  Bunker Busters!
[01:15:40.644 --> 01:15:40.864]  Pardon me?
[01:15:41.371 --> 01:15:43.051]  You're talking about bunker busters?
[01:15:43.071 --> 01:15:54.775]  Yeah, well, the test target for that thing was a 10 foot by 20 by 20 by 20 by 10 foot hunk of reinforced concrete, which is a kind of a hard target.
[01:15:54.795 --> 01:15:55.275]  But anyway.
[01:15:55.295 --> 01:15:55.695]  Well, thank you.
[01:15:56.115 --> 01:16:00.996]  I mean, it's important for folks to know your credentials because you're extremely credentialed, ultra credentialed.
[01:16:02.417 --> 01:16:05.398]  Now let's go back to the Communist Third International in this program.
[01:16:07.692 --> 01:16:25.110]  In the jobs that I had in the weapons area, looking ahead 10, 20, 30 years in the future, what the communist world was doing and your threat for the projected future was a very significant thing with respect to what you needed to develop and what your requirements were.
[01:16:25.751 --> 01:16:27.993]  And so consequently, I studied everything.
[01:16:28.013 --> 01:16:30.155]  I've been a student of this for over 60 years.
[01:16:31.440 --> 01:16:39.487]  But when I was in weapons development, you had access to almost all relevant classified information dealing with enemies and everything else.
[01:16:40.227 --> 01:16:50.936]  But I made it my business to know and understand so that I could sort of have a handle on moving the programs that we needed to move for the next 10, 20, 30 years.
[01:16:52.377 --> 01:16:54.238]  So that's sort of background.
[01:16:54.298 --> 01:16:57.521]  But let's get into the program of the Third International, which I started.
[01:16:58.862 --> 01:16:59.883]  They set up this group
[01:17:01.325 --> 01:17:07.288]  To develop the program of Third International to transform every square inch of the world into this new world order.
[01:17:08.408 --> 01:17:10.129]  A global system.
[01:17:11.009 --> 01:17:14.531]  And they picked their best and brightest from around the world.
[01:17:14.571 --> 01:17:16.091]  These were not people all from Russia.
[01:17:16.111 --> 01:17:18.552]  Some were from Russia, but they're from all over the world.
[01:17:19.473 --> 01:17:22.454]  And they worked for nine years.
[01:17:23.414 --> 01:17:29.137]  And at the Six-Party Congress in Moscow, the program was presented for final approval
[01:17:29.887 --> 01:17:31.188]  Six International Congress.
[01:17:31.689 --> 01:17:34.251]  There were over 500 delegates there from around the world.
[01:17:34.271 --> 01:17:35.973]  There were 25 from the United States.
[01:17:35.993 --> 01:17:48.644]  20 of them were voting, and the party strength for the International Congress was sort of based on the party level of activity in the various countries, just like the Democratic Party has today or the Republican Party.
[01:17:48.664 --> 01:17:52.027]  Your voting strength depends upon the number of members you have.
[01:17:54.562 --> 01:17:57.764]  And my conclusion was the War College.
[01:17:57.804 --> 01:18:10.731]  I collected information on the Sino-Soviet split stuff for 10 years, and when I was at War College, I had the time to pull together a book on that to show decisively and definitively that the Sino-Soviet split was a hoax.
[01:18:11.511 --> 01:18:17.135]  Now, Anatoly Golitsyn, who wrote New Lies for Old about 15 years later, he was a CIA
[01:18:18.502 --> 01:18:21.983]  Informant, he was defected from the Soviet Union.
[01:18:22.023 --> 01:18:29.826]  He had been to the powerful schools and when he was defected to Finland, he got out and came to the United States and advised the CIA for a while.
[01:18:30.426 --> 01:18:37.068]  But Gillespie said that he called the Sino-Soviet split a strategic disinformation program.
[01:18:37.168 --> 01:18:38.429]  Stay right there, we've got a break.
[01:18:38.469 --> 01:18:41.470]  We'll continue with the program when we get back.
[01:18:42.159 --> 01:18:44.242]  You got the bankers behind it all.
[01:18:44.963 --> 01:18:45.563]  Stay with us.
[01:18:45.603 --> 01:18:47.445]  General Benton K. Parton on the other side.
[01:18:47.886 --> 01:18:49.768]  General, we'll be back in a little over three minutes.
[01:18:56.176 --> 01:18:57.838]  Do you know the truth about breast cancer?
[01:18:58.419 --> 01:19:00.161]  Did you know that the race for the cure is over?

[01:21:52.679 --> 01:21:59.623]  Many people have wondered what has happened to the once great United States of America, why the moral decay that has been taking place within it.
[01:22:00.883 --> 01:22:04.946]  The United States has been targeted for overthrow for world government.
[01:22:05.686 --> 01:22:12.710]  The United Nations has been established to redistribute the wealth of the world away from the United States, Great Britain, and Western Europe.
[01:22:13.590 --> 01:22:22.353]  You need to know, as a specific individual citizen of the United States of America, why these things are happening and what you can do about it.

[01:22:57.515 --> 01:22:59.156]  General Martin joins us.
[01:23:01.657 --> 01:23:06.119]  General, I want to... It's time we'll get past this here.
[01:23:06.159 --> 01:23:06.759]  Run away from us.
[01:23:08.169 --> 01:23:34.766]  I want to get through the basic history of the Communist Third International, and then I want to get your take on why the entire neocon structure, the founders and leadership of it, are admitted Trotskyites, who claim in the 60s they then decided to become neocons, and even liberal papers, you know, headlines, Toronto Star, The Ghost of Lennon Walks the Halls of the White House, that was a headline, and people go, well these are conservatives!
[01:23:35.476 --> 01:23:42.578]  So I want to spend some time on that as well and talk about this Global New World Order, what it's going to look like, how it's going to operate as it begins to come into view.
[01:23:42.879 --> 01:23:43.799]  But please continue, sir.
[01:23:43.819 --> 01:23:44.699]  Let me make the point.
[01:23:45.239 --> 01:23:54.382]  As I said, the number one strategic disinformation program from 1955 to about 1989 was the Sino-Soviet split.
[01:23:54.563 --> 01:24:01.845]  And it was used many, many, I listed in that book, I listed 50 payoffs to the implementation of the program from that idea.
[01:24:02.603 --> 01:24:10.367]  And since 1991, the number one strategic disinformation program that they push is, communism is dead.
[01:24:10.387 --> 01:24:17.170]  As a good friend of mine and a very knowledgeable person in these areas said, the only thing dead about communism is its enemies.
[01:24:18.711 --> 01:24:28.376]  You mentioned the Leninists in the Pentagon, or other places, may say they're probably more Trotskyites than they are Leninists.
[01:24:29.743 --> 01:24:33.745]  And the basic seminal document on terrorism... No, no, you're right.
[01:24:33.785 --> 01:24:35.526]  The headline was, The Ghost of Trotsky.
[01:24:35.647 --> 01:24:36.787]  Excuse me, it wasn't Lenin.
[01:24:36.807 --> 01:24:37.128]  You're right.
[01:24:37.328 --> 01:24:43.252]  Well, the seminal document on terrorism was written by Trotsky when he was head of the Soviet military.
[01:24:43.592 --> 01:24:46.314]  And the title was, In Defense of Terrorism.
[01:24:47.074 --> 01:24:53.839]  And basically, as I said, the basic conclusion of the book is, if you don't support terrorism, you don't support the cause.
[01:24:54.443 --> 01:24:57.525]  And he says in his book, I'll just give you a couple of experts.
[01:24:57.805 --> 01:25:07.572]  He says you crush the enemy, you cut off the heads of traitors, you avenge treachery, enemies of the new order, unity of will, unity of direction, unity of action.
[01:25:08.072 --> 01:25:20.881]  He calls the non-communist a vulture class, principles of compulsory labor, militarization labor, our savagery toward the bourgeoisie, which display no tendency to resist.
[01:25:21.437 --> 01:25:23.198]  He says it's a merciless struggle.
[01:25:23.258 --> 01:25:25.898]  It's an insolent challenge to the balance of forces.
[01:25:26.239 --> 01:25:27.319]  It goes on and on and on.
[01:25:27.659 --> 01:25:33.861]  The similar document on terrorism was written by Leon Trotsky when he was around 1922.
[01:25:35.361 --> 01:25:36.062]  I don't know.
[01:25:36.082 --> 01:25:38.642]  It's been lifted everywhere from libraries and whatnot.
[01:25:38.962 --> 01:25:42.704]  I got my copies from the Army War College at Carlisle Barracks.
[01:25:43.504 --> 01:25:45.024]  And I've distributed a lot of those around.
[01:25:45.464 --> 01:25:46.925]  But anyway, going back to the program.
[01:25:48.027 --> 01:25:58.130]  The program, at the time they published the program in 1928, they adopted and published a companion document which covered wars of national liberation.
[01:25:58.230 --> 01:26:05.173]  Wars of national liberation was such a big part of their strategy for transforming the world that they had to publish a separate document for that.
[01:26:06.093 --> 01:26:15.116]  And it's in fact, there's more pages in that document than there is in the program of Third International because the wars of national liberation are such a such a big effort.
[01:26:15.595 --> 01:26:30.446]  Now what they did, the program calls, what you do in banking, business, industry, agriculture, almost every area of economic and cultural activity in the world is addressed in that program.
[01:26:31.307 --> 01:26:36.171]  And in the banking area, they pretty much implemented what they said they were going to do there on a global basis.
[01:26:36.911 --> 01:26:45.318]  Now, but from my point of view, and from my interest militarily, I was always concerned with
[01:26:45.959 --> 01:26:53.061]  The program aspects that dealt with transforming and transferring country by country by country into this global hierarchy.
[01:26:54.161 --> 01:26:56.401]  And that's where I concentrated most of my effort.
[01:26:56.441 --> 01:27:08.804]  Most of the effort in the program in the Wars of National Liberation document deals with that transformation of power and transferring all the world into this new global hierarchy of regional governments.
[01:27:09.764 --> 01:27:13.405]  And there's no question, no question that
[01:27:14.392 --> 01:27:15.853]  That program is still operative.
[01:27:17.074 --> 01:27:20.095]  Let me just give you a quickie quickie current example of something.
[01:27:20.556 --> 01:27:27.219]  Gus Hall wrote a book, Can We Survive Under Capitalism?, about 30, I think, 35 years ago.
[01:27:28.080 --> 01:27:37.485]  And really, he says right off the bat, the crisis of the environment, like others, has its root cause and characteristics of capitalism.
[01:27:38.025 --> 01:27:43.068]  He goes on to say that the cause of pollution in the world is the profit motive of private business.
[01:27:43.903 --> 01:27:49.085]  And he says, in the book, he says, the ultimate solution, of course, is the creation of a planned society.
[01:27:49.105 --> 01:27:50.565]  In other words, socialize the world.
[01:27:51.085 --> 01:27:55.326]  And right toward the end, he says, I'll just give you what he says at the end.
[01:27:56.187 --> 01:28:08.230]  It is hoped that this book will be a factor in helping the millions who are getting the experience of struggle in the movement against pollution to become a new force in the transition from capitalism to socialism.
[01:28:08.730 --> 01:28:11.051]  Now, I'll say this, the environmental front
[01:28:11.872 --> 01:28:12.432]  Stay there, General.
[01:28:12.452 --> 01:28:14.574]  I want to continue along this line of discussion.
[01:28:14.594 --> 01:28:16.255]  I want to talk about the neocons.
[01:28:16.515 --> 01:28:17.536]  I want to discuss them.
[01:28:17.716 --> 01:28:18.896]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:44.213 --> 01:28:45.114]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.614 --> 01:28:47.215]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:48.156 --> 01:28:50.818]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.931 --> 01:28:55.933]  Gee, honey, your feet look great in those sandals.
[01:28:56.073 --> 01:28:56.413]  Thanks.
[01:28:56.673 --> 01:28:58.935]  Last summer I was too embarrassed by my nails to wear them.
[01:28:59.035 --> 01:29:01.056]  Well, your toenails sure look clear and healthy now.
[01:29:01.176 --> 01:29:02.577]  Makes me feel terrible about mine.
[01:29:02.618 --> 01:29:04.459]  See, this one looks thick, that one's yellow.
[01:29:04.539 --> 01:29:06.400]  What you need is Non-X Nail Gel.
[01:29:06.520 --> 01:29:09.663]  Non-X clears out the buildup that discolors toenails and fingernails.
[01:29:09.923 --> 01:29:11.104]  It's called Keratin Debris.
[01:29:11.244 --> 01:29:12.505]  Just apply Non-X daily.
[01:29:12.585 --> 01:29:14.646]  And I'll have clear, healthy-looking toenails?
[01:29:14.867 --> 01:29:15.687]  Just look at mine!
[01:29:15.847 --> 01:29:18.269]  Podiatrist recommended Non-X Nail Gel.
[01:29:18.469 --> 01:29:23.333]  Now at Walgreens, Long's, Eckerd Pharmacy, Rite Aid, and Brooks Pharmacy in the foot care section.
[01:29:25.279 --> 01:29:26.099]  Looking for profits?

[01:29:31.320 --> 01:29:38.901]  This low mintage collector coin with a total series mintage under $600,000 has sold at four times its current price.
[01:29:38.961 --> 01:29:42.462]  Falling dollar values and inflation make this likely to happen again.

[01:30:55.317 --> 01:30:56.177]  You change the oil.

[01:31:46.274 --> 01:31:46.755]  Call now!
[01:32:08.348 --> 01:32:12.330]  General Ben K. Parton, former head of Air Force Weapons Development, is our guest.
[01:32:12.350 --> 01:32:18.554]  He was pivotal in exposing the Oklahoma City bombing covered up and the fact that charges were inside the building.
[01:32:18.574 --> 01:32:24.537]  And he's also been pivotal in the fight against the international communist program of enslavement.
[01:32:25.418 --> 01:32:37.485]  Now understand, what the big bankers have done, and I've researched this in depth, and David Rockefeller's bragged about it, is they funded these criminal gangs to go and take over country after country to set up their New World Order.
[01:32:38.627 --> 01:32:40.969]  And look at how the Fortune 500 loves China.
[01:32:41.009 --> 01:32:41.850]  They love Russia.
[01:32:42.571 --> 01:32:44.012]  And, of course, the environmental movement.
[01:32:44.293 --> 01:32:44.893]  I know a lot of them.
[01:32:44.913 --> 01:32:46.435]  They will openly tell you they're communists.
[01:32:46.935 --> 01:32:49.598]  They're watermelons, green on the outside, red on the inside.
[01:32:50.655 --> 01:32:51.696]  And it's neo-feudalism.
[01:32:51.716 --> 01:32:56.339]  It's an excuse to grab and steal property, destroy production in this nation.
[01:32:56.759 --> 01:33:03.163]  And then meanwhile, none of those international treaties, Kyoto or any of them, are on China or on Russia or any other country.
[01:33:03.483 --> 01:33:05.364]  And they're the worst environmental offenders.
[01:33:05.424 --> 01:33:10.308]  I mean, they just throw nuclear reactors in their oceans, in the sea, in their lakes.
[01:33:10.408 --> 01:33:12.689]  They dump toxic waste.
[01:33:12.789 --> 01:33:15.331]  Their nuclear power plants explode and go critical.
[01:33:16.082 --> 01:33:18.824]  All of this goes on, but that's always ignored by the environmentalists.
[01:33:18.864 --> 01:33:19.325]  It's okay.
[01:33:19.665 --> 01:33:23.248]  Anything is okay for the struggle against the evil bankers.
[01:33:23.828 --> 01:33:27.431]  But it turns out the bankers are running the entire scam.
[01:33:27.551 --> 01:33:36.938]  General Partner, I want to go through the program, the steps they used to overthrow a country, then use that country as an engine to go with the next country, what stage we're at here in the United States.
[01:33:37.639 --> 01:33:42.302]  But before we do that, sir, I want you to go further than you've ever gone on air before.
[01:33:42.342 --> 01:33:42.883]  I'd like you to
[01:33:44.181 --> 01:33:47.965]  I mean, America's in too much trouble for us to mince words here, and you've never done that.
[01:33:48.705 --> 01:33:49.966]  And that's why we appreciate you.
[01:33:50.267 --> 01:33:56.813]  The neocons, Benjamin Chertoff, the rest of them, the crystals of the world.
[01:33:57.686 --> 01:34:13.636]  You know, openly, their daddies and others, especially Crystal, you know, the head of the Trotskyites after Trotsky was killed down in Mexico, and they're implementing secret police in America, they're implementing biometrics, they're implementing all this classical control.
[01:34:13.656 --> 01:34:15.358]  They've hired Primakov as a consultant.
[01:34:16.198 --> 01:34:19.600]  We've confirmed that they hired Marcus Wolff, former head of the Stasi, as a consultant.
[01:34:19.861 --> 01:34:20.621]  I didn't believe that.
[01:34:20.641 --> 01:34:21.922]  I actually called and confirmed it.
[01:34:22.582 --> 01:34:29.388]  Well, the same kind of crowd was around doing their dirty work during the Roosevelt administration and almost every one we've had since.
[01:34:29.408 --> 01:34:37.815]  I could go on to a long story about a meeting I participated in in Washington
[01:34:51.352 --> 01:35:03.056]  And one of these neocons was called on the carpet, and the question I had asked, Morton Blackwell of course, but anyway... Please indulge us.
[01:35:03.076 --> 01:35:03.736]  Tell us the story.
[01:35:04.256 --> 01:35:05.216]  Tell us his classifieds.
[01:35:05.396 --> 01:35:20.901]  Well, you know, you used to have CPAC conference, and another one, the technical side of elections, Morton Blackwell and Reed Irvine, the guy who heads up the Greece Free Congress Foundation, set up another national meeting
[01:35:21.987 --> 01:35:25.008]  Here in Washington, where they were discussing a lot of political things.
[01:35:25.768 --> 01:35:30.930]  And Morton sent the agenda to me and asked me my comments on it.
[01:35:31.150 --> 01:35:34.771]  He had sent me the agenda of who was going to be participating and what was going to be covered.
[01:35:35.472 --> 01:35:48.856]  And when I got the thing and looked at it, I said, my gosh, here they had one of the main events and the panels they have in the afternoon dealt with the subject of communism is dead, but what about the residual problems?
[01:35:50.186 --> 01:36:00.989]  And they had, that was the main panel for the afternoon, and they had three speak, spokespersons addressing that, and none of the three really had a handle on the problem to address it.
[01:36:01.870 --> 01:36:17.875]  And I, at the meeting, Morton, or at the time, I picked up the phone and called Morton and told him, I said, you can't have a meeting on that subject without having somebody address the problem of what's living and what's dead in communism, you know.
[01:36:17.995 --> 01:36:19.075]  You can't just say it's dead.
[01:36:19.676 --> 01:36:21.317]  You gotta discuss that.
[01:36:21.417 --> 01:36:22.899]  And he said, I'm on my way to Europe.
[01:36:23.379 --> 01:36:26.381]  I'll be back in a week and I'll call you and we'll discuss it further.
[01:36:26.782 --> 01:36:47.298]  He never called me, so I was at the meeting, participating in the afternoon panel, and I raised the question, I think, to Reid Irvine, who was the chair in the panel, and I asked Reid Irvine, I said, how can you have a meeting on this subject without having somebody addressing the issue or idea of what's dead and what's still alive and going?
[01:36:48.047 --> 01:37:04.716]  And he went into a little gither about it, so he passed the book to Morton Blackwell, who's a national committee man, a very articulate guy, and it was embarrassing to him, so he turned to one of the neocons there and said, you've had a lot of experience in this area, would you address the question?
[01:37:05.917 --> 01:37:12.721]  And the individual stood up and said, well, in my time, we all believed in the perfectibility of the socialist man.
[01:37:14.699 --> 01:37:29.790]  But you go to Moscow today and the socialist man is an alcoholic bureaucrat who won't work, and sat down, and that was the answer to the question.
[01:37:30.971 --> 01:37:34.574]  But you can see what the depth of that answer.
[01:37:35.735 --> 01:37:37.336]  There is no depth.
[01:37:37.616 --> 01:37:40.218]  It's paper thin, but I mean specifically addressing
[01:37:41.124 --> 01:37:46.389]  Everything you talk about in the program, America is turning into a police state, but our borders are wide open.
[01:37:46.409 --> 01:38:04.285]  I don't know if you know this, General, but even the Dallas Morning News admitted that Bush and Fox hired a PR firm, Rob Allen and Co., to run these illegal alien demonstrations, and they're being led, almost entirely, by admitted open communists, and then it's George Bush and Vicente Fox running the whole thing!
[01:38:04.981 --> 01:38:11.306]  Well, there are a lot of worse things probably I could mention with respect to the drug traffic through there.
[01:38:12.988 --> 01:38:15.790]  But specifically, I mean, the neocons, who are these people?
[01:38:18.712 --> 01:38:25.918]  Well, just like in every administration we've had for a long time, they've been working toward the objectives of the program of the Third International.
[01:38:27.239 --> 01:38:32.744]  And they're people who come from all kinds of walks of life, but they're entrapped in or
[01:38:33.858 --> 01:38:34.578]  I think so.
[01:38:34.598 --> 01:38:35.599]  I think so.
[01:39:01.400 --> 01:39:07.545]  All the way from the top down to the debutant system at the secondary level in the Soviet government was about 525 people.
[01:39:08.185 --> 01:39:11.568]  And the majority of those were people who were involved.
[01:39:11.648 --> 01:39:15.390]  Many of them escaped to Russia in the 1905 revolution and came to this country.
[01:39:15.971 --> 01:39:23.977]  And 333 of them came out of the Bronx in New York of those 500 and some positions.
[01:39:24.037 --> 01:39:29.421]  So you've had an orchestration of the people who were trained in and are
[01:39:31.725 --> 01:39:35.189]  This program of the Third International, and they're working toward that objective.
[01:39:35.850 --> 01:39:42.817]  And just like the individual said at that meeting in Washington, we believe in the perfectibility of the Soviet man.
[01:39:44.540 --> 01:39:50.283]  And then, oh, now the entire neocon leadership, they were high-level communists, but it doesn't matter.
[01:39:50.343 --> 01:40:11.232]  Now they're good conservatives we can trust, but Bush says he's for the assault weapons ban, and he's for open borders, and he signed back on to the United Nations-UNESCO treaty, and on and on and on, and now Rupert Murdoch meets every week with Hillary, and the Bushes call Bill Clinton their surrogate son, and they're just all one big happy, friendly family.
[01:40:11.272 --> 01:40:12.473]  General Parton, let's go through
[01:40:13.248 --> 01:40:14.349]  Let's go through the program.
[01:40:14.369 --> 01:40:15.349]  If we don't, we're not going to miss it.
[01:40:15.569 --> 01:40:15.950]  Exactly.
[01:40:15.970 --> 01:40:18.071]  Let's go through how they implement this thing.
[01:40:18.091 --> 01:40:20.913]  I'm talking about the transfer of power.
[01:40:21.033 --> 01:40:24.955]  I'm not talking about what you're doing in banking, what you're doing in agriculture, or what you're doing in trade.
[01:40:26.796 --> 01:40:31.099]  Trade, the WTO is managing the global part of the trade aspects.
[01:40:31.119 --> 01:40:35.722]  If you look at the program and what they're talking about doing in trade, WTO is the orchestrator of that.
[01:40:36.874 --> 01:40:37.994]  The World Trade Organization.
[01:40:38.014 --> 01:40:38.595]  Sure, go for it.
[01:40:38.615 --> 01:40:39.815]  I mean, break down whatever you want.
[01:40:39.835 --> 01:40:52.659]  The program, though, with respect to transferring power from country to country to country into this global hierarchy, I said before, they divided the world into three different kinds of countries based on their vulnerabilities.
[01:40:53.139 --> 01:40:55.560]  The first group was what they called the capitalist countries.
[01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:57.681]  Western Europe, Australia, and Japan.
[01:40:58.641 --> 01:41:06.324]  To a certain extent, they considered the United States a capitalist country, but primarily a colonial country because of what they called the oppressed nations within.
[01:41:06.778 --> 01:41:25.470]  The Chicanos, the American Indians, the black community, and they promised them a war of national liberation to give them a separate country, just like what you have out there in the Southwest today, and they call it Aztlan.
[01:41:25.490 --> 01:41:34.115]  The farther you go west, the more intense the feeling is about this, and you go to California to make a speech, and they welcome you, and they welcome you to Aztlan, you know?
[01:41:35.041 --> 01:41:47.530]  And because they had committed to provide this revolutionary struggle to split off that part of the world, of the country, to a new Hispanic community.
[01:41:48.590 --> 01:41:53.854]  And the same thing had been promised to the South, in the black community.
[01:41:54.334 --> 01:41:59.678]  But when they set up the Soviet Union, they promised all kinds of ethnic groups, countries.
[01:41:59.758 --> 01:42:03.120]  In fact, there was a country that was supposed to be set up for the Jewish community.
[01:42:03.530 --> 01:42:05.031]  But they never did that.
[01:42:05.111 --> 01:42:11.537]  They set up all these separate countries, nationality groups, but then they tried to sovietize all of them.
[01:42:12.237 --> 01:42:14.700]  And that caused a lot of problems itself.
[01:42:15.300 --> 01:42:18.483]  But going back, they divided the world into three different kinds of countries.
[01:42:18.563 --> 01:42:23.928]  The capitalist countries were to be transferred to socialism by democratic processes.
[01:42:24.248 --> 01:42:29.773]  There were open societies, legislatures that could subvert and take over those countries internally.
[01:42:30.746 --> 01:42:32.027]  They're subversive processes.
[01:42:32.447 --> 01:42:36.010]  The second group of countries were countries they called the median level of development.
[01:42:36.450 --> 01:42:43.735]  They were countries that had a fairly sound and long-term economic basis, a good balance between business, industry, and agriculture.
[01:42:44.375 --> 01:42:55.122]  And they had a strategy where they were going to establish all these co-ops to break the back of business, the profit motive, and set up a strong system of unions
[01:42:55.874 --> 01:43:00.879]  And a whole bunch of other factors they were going to implement to transition those countries to socialism.
[01:43:01.759 --> 01:43:06.263]  But the rest of the world they classified as either a colonial or a semi-colonial.
[01:43:06.764 --> 01:43:08.546]  You all know what a colonial country is.
[01:43:08.566 --> 01:43:12.309]  It's the one that's occupied or controlled by a foreign country.
[01:43:13.390 --> 01:43:18.735]  A semi-colonial country is a free and independent nation that falls under the dominant influence of a major power.
[01:43:19.275 --> 01:43:21.177]  So everything in the Western Hemisphere
[01:43:22.034 --> 01:43:24.516]  We fell under the dominant influence of the United States.
[01:43:24.536 --> 01:43:26.237]  We used to have a Monroe Doctrine, remember?
[01:43:26.918 --> 01:43:42.269]  So, everything in the Western Hemisphere was considered to be colonial or semi-colonial, and all the colonial and semi-colonial countries, which was most of the world, were to be transitioned and transformed into socialism by a war of national liberation.
[01:43:42.690 --> 01:43:49.895]  And they provided a very thick, not very thick document, but a detailed document on how you conduct a war of national liberation.
[01:43:51.781 --> 01:43:53.002]  Let me just step through those.
[01:43:53.022 --> 01:43:56.703]  The War of National Liberation is a three-phase program.
[01:43:57.424 --> 01:43:59.865]  Phase one, they call the preparatory phase.
[01:44:00.365 --> 01:44:04.507]  You begin with infiltrating, recruiting, organizing, media control.
[01:44:04.567 --> 01:44:06.588]  You exacerbate the conflict thesis.
[01:44:07.108 --> 01:44:11.650]  If it's racial, whatever, you exacerbate the conflict thesis.
[01:44:12.111 --> 01:44:14.472]  You establish revolutionary justification.
[01:44:14.912 --> 01:44:17.093]  If you don't have a basis, you generate one.
[01:44:17.611 --> 01:44:19.993]  You have peaceful demonstrations, propaganda.
[01:44:20.434 --> 01:44:29.162]  You subvert the culture, religion, education, politics, values, the military, law enforcement, and agnosia.
[01:44:30.323 --> 01:44:33.806]  You undermine business, industry, and agriculture, and the family.
[01:44:34.046 --> 01:44:35.407]  Very important things to subvert.
[01:44:35.628 --> 01:44:37.029]  You subvert the institutions.
[01:44:37.670 --> 01:44:41.613]  You dismantle, you disseminate disinformation.
[01:44:41.793 --> 01:44:43.435]  You employ strategic deception.
[01:44:44.088 --> 01:44:46.189]  Environmentalism is one of the biggest threats.
[01:44:46.510 --> 01:44:47.650]  Undermine the economy.
[01:44:48.030 --> 01:44:48.811]  Control money.
[01:44:49.291 --> 01:44:53.053]  Remove the death penalty and disarm the citizenry.
[01:44:53.114 --> 01:44:54.514]  Those are the last two things.
[01:44:55.035 --> 01:44:58.477]  Remove the death penalty and disarm the citizens.
[01:44:58.877 --> 01:45:11.945]  Then when you do that, at the appropriate time in the sequence of depending on where you are in the other nations and where the progress is there, you make a transition to what they call the period of escalating violence.
[01:45:12.879 --> 01:45:15.160]  And we're right now at that transition period.
[01:45:15.660 --> 01:45:18.980]  Moving from the preparatory phase to the period of escalating violence.
[01:45:19.080 --> 01:45:21.261]  And not only this country, but a number of other countries.
[01:45:21.821 --> 01:45:24.902]  You start off with political assassinations, bank robberies.
[01:45:25.302 --> 01:45:30.443]  You remember some of the kids who were involved in the bombing in Oklahoma were picked up for bank robbing, right?
[01:45:31.063 --> 01:45:34.584]  That's where Trotsky had his initial fame, bank robbery.
[01:45:35.044 --> 01:45:37.244]  You get more people involved, you need more money.
[01:45:37.724 --> 01:45:38.945]  Kidnappings for ransom.
[01:45:39.485 --> 01:45:40.045]  Terrorism.
[01:45:40.976 --> 01:45:44.798]  And terrorism plays a very major part in wars of national liberation.
[01:45:45.418 --> 01:46:02.065]  It produces intimidation, demoralization, you establish that you have no mercy, and they say if you want obedience, you establish that you have no mercy, and that's the way you get obedience, and the resistance collapses.
[01:46:02.826 --> 01:46:10.329]  Destabilization with refugees, inflow of people, money, and equipment, guerrilla warfare, urban guerrilla warfare, limited warfare,
[01:46:10.859 --> 01:46:13.509]  You go as far as you need to go in violence.
[01:46:13.908 --> 01:46:16.710]  To transfer power to a revolutionary council.
[01:46:16.850 --> 01:46:20.212]  And so in a situation like that, you're in control of the government already.
[01:46:20.232 --> 01:46:23.535]  You're trying to bring in even greater levels of crisis.
[01:46:23.695 --> 01:46:27.297]  You march the government out, the police out, the military out to confiscate guns.
[01:46:28.078 --> 01:46:34.503]  You like it when then the population starts fighting back because it creates even more hysteria.
[01:46:34.703 --> 01:46:34.943]  Sure.
[01:46:35.443 --> 01:46:43.589]  Now, the third phase is what they, and you take that, the phase two goes up to where you transfer power to a revolutionary council.
[01:46:44.563 --> 01:46:46.264]  And a revolutionary control.
[01:46:46.284 --> 01:46:52.028]  And you still may not control all the country, but you've taken over the power from the government.
[01:46:52.468 --> 01:46:55.110]  Phase 3 is what they call the period of exploitation.
[01:46:55.130 --> 01:47:08.099]  In other words, once you gain control of country X, through the War on National Liberation, you've gone through phase 2, you're ready to move into phase 3, under the communist control.
[01:47:08.179 --> 01:47:09.540]  So what do you do in phase 3?
[01:47:09.960 --> 01:47:11.381]  You liquidate the opposition.
[01:47:12.099 --> 01:47:15.422]  You liquidate or re-educate potential opposition.
[01:47:16.082 --> 01:47:19.485]  You work to perfect the new socialist man.
[01:47:20.225 --> 01:47:24.728]  You provide a basis of operation for the next target countries.
[01:47:24.808 --> 01:47:33.495]  In other words, Castro in Cuba has been, in the period of exploitation, training people in the middle Americas and South America ever since around 1960.
[01:47:35.797 --> 01:47:40.800]  And I remember one time hearing a briefing where they said they had already trained way, way, way back there.
[01:47:42.074 --> 01:47:45.015]  And placed in the United States 65,000 of those trained people.
[01:47:45.435 --> 01:48:00.302]  But then they act like they're in a fight against the U.S., but meanwhile our own government is sending oil and grain to the Soviet Union, meanwhile David Rockefeller owns aluminum plants, Arm and Hammer, meanwhile they're writing obituaries for Mao when he dies.
[01:48:00.902 --> 01:48:02.023]  All of this is going on.
[01:48:04.424 --> 01:48:04.824]  Yeah.
[01:48:04.844 --> 01:48:07.445]  I mean, at the start of this hour I talked about how
[01:48:08.220 --> 01:48:17.007]  The bankers, you know, the big elite money men who don't like free market, who don't like competition, who want to consolidate total control, have been funding this all along.
[01:48:17.047 --> 01:48:24.894]  And Carol Quigley's book, Bill Clinton's mentor, the head of the political science department at Georgetown, for those who don't know, he wrote a 900-plus page book.
[01:48:24.934 --> 01:48:32.140]  He said, we're the globalists, and we use the communists, and we use the fascists, we use anything that centralizes, and we've got a plan.
[01:48:32.180 --> 01:48:33.100]  He called it a program.
[01:48:33.120 --> 01:48:34.922]  I don't know if you've read that book, General.
[01:48:35.242 --> 01:48:35.622]  I have it.
[01:48:35.923 --> 01:48:42.450]  And he just runs through it all, but they don't, at the top, they don't call it communism.
[01:48:42.550 --> 01:48:46.794]  Let me step through the rest of these things real quick, so you can get on a more common basis here.
[01:48:47.935 --> 01:48:51.519]  They moved to support the World Commonwealth of Independent States.
[01:48:52.240 --> 01:48:54.442]  Now, the former Soviet Union
[01:48:55.197 --> 01:48:59.299]  It's now called the CIS, the Commonwealth of Independent States.
[01:48:59.479 --> 01:49:04.521]  Yeah, notice something from, you know, 70, 80 years ago is exactly what we have today.
[01:49:04.601 --> 01:49:05.301]  It's incredible.
[01:49:07.082 --> 01:49:14.445]  You remove the public ownership, you go to public ownership of property, and you move to eliminate all religions.
[01:49:15.345 --> 01:49:19.327]  Now, there's been one significant change to that program.
[01:49:19.547 --> 01:49:21.928]  After World War II, you have a number of countries
[01:49:22.679 --> 01:49:25.401]  That had a war on national liberation underway.
[01:49:26.382 --> 01:49:29.684]  And World War II interrupted that and a lot of countries... Hold it there, General.
[01:49:29.704 --> 01:49:30.504]  We've got to break again.
[01:49:30.524 --> 01:49:31.025]  We'll come back.
[01:49:31.065 --> 01:49:31.805]  You can finish up.
[01:49:32.286 --> 01:49:35.948]  And then I want to get into what this program will look like if they get it in place.
[01:49:36.328 --> 01:49:39.170]  How it ties into the IMF, the World Bank, the WTO.
[01:49:40.331 --> 01:49:47.116]  Because I've, you know, heard you in the past, read articles in the past quoting you where you get into how all this operates.
[01:49:47.176 --> 01:49:48.597]  Because we're really moving into it.
[01:49:49.057 --> 01:49:50.338]  We'll be right back with General Parton.
[01:49:54.753 --> 01:50:02.117]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[01:50:02.397 --> 01:50:07.140]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[01:50:07.360 --> 01:50:13.003]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[01:50:13.243 --> 01:50:17.767]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[01:50:18.047 --> 01:50:25.153]  Attached was society control grid, infallible microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[01:50:25.173 --> 01:50:29.717]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[01:50:29.877 --> 01:50:32.379]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[01:50:32.619 --> 01:50:39.325]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.
[01:50:39.565 --> 01:50:44.813]  Order online now at Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling 1-888-253-3139.
[01:50:44.833 --> 01:50:45.254]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:50:53.763 --> 01:51:02.031]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water and did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[01:51:02.271 --> 01:51:06.635]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate and others are absorbed through the skin.
[01:51:06.935 --> 01:51:15.843]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury and iron and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae and fungus in your shower.
[01:51:16.064 --> 01:51:19.687]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound and is recyclable.
[01:51:19.947 --> 01:51:24.990]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[01:51:25.271 --> 01:51:32.015]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[01:51:32.495 --> 01:51:33.036]  What about you?
[01:51:33.789 --> 01:51:39.152]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[01:52:55.121 --> 01:53:00.265]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:53:00.945 --> 01:53:03.287]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:53:03.307 --> 01:53:09.831]  Alright, we've gotten to the point of a major change to the program.
[01:53:10.131 --> 01:53:11.753]  Please continue, General Parton.
[01:53:12.893 --> 01:53:20.999]  After World War II, there were a number of countries that had a war of national liberation underway that had not gone to completion.
[01:53:23.181 --> 01:53:32.984]  They set up another strategy, and the communist world set up another strategy, and on an experimental base they applied it in Egypt at first, and Nasser was the agent.
[01:53:34.244 --> 01:53:38.945]  That strategy was implemented, Nasser became the chief of state in Egypt.
[01:53:39.826 --> 01:53:51.689]  The party congress in Moscow in 1960 adopted that change in the strategy where those countries had gone to gain their freedom and independence without going to socialism.
[01:53:52.655 --> 01:53:58.740]  And they published that in the strategy they used in the World Marxist Review, I think, in 1996.
[01:53:58.820 --> 01:54:03.123]  But that's in the public record.
[01:54:03.163 --> 01:54:05.225]  You can get the change in that strategy.
[01:54:05.845 --> 01:54:10.109]  Now, remember, Nasser was the agent there.
[01:54:11.530 --> 01:54:17.815]  They outlawed... Actually, the Open Communist Party got out of the gas cans and crowbars and started burning in Saq and Cairo.
[01:54:18.195 --> 01:54:22.198]  Nasser stood up with his 12 lieutenants and said, we're your new law and order party.
[01:54:22.737 --> 01:54:27.360]  And they just took over and the Communists, you know, supported them.
[01:54:27.600 --> 01:54:40.507]  Now let's be clear, their low-level people go out and carry out acts of terror, and then meanwhile their boss stands up and claims he's going to clean it up, then they don't go after the actual Communists, they go and arrest innocent people and blame them with it.
[01:54:41.027 --> 01:54:48.011]  Yeah, well, in Egypt they locked up everybody you could find a fenced-in place to put them almost for a long time.
[01:54:48.809 --> 01:54:55.934]  But anyway, the Block Within Strategy was adopted for those countries that had gained their independence without going into socialism.
[01:54:56.334 --> 01:54:57.715]  They applied it first in Egypt.
[01:54:57.755 --> 01:54:59.997]  The second place they applied it was in Iraq.
[01:55:01.398 --> 01:55:03.379]  They did the same thing in Iran.
[01:55:03.540 --> 01:55:05.201]  They did the same thing in Libya.
[01:55:05.901 --> 01:55:07.763]  And you had a little different process.
[01:55:07.783 --> 01:55:11.545]  They did it in Lebanon, what they're trying to do on the Mexican border.
[01:55:12.186 --> 01:55:16.609]  And all those countries down there in the Middle East,
[01:55:18.207 --> 01:55:22.810]  Generally, most every one of them have Soviet advisors and Soviet weapons.
[01:55:22.850 --> 01:55:27.674]  Well, we're going to get to that later, but right now, for the person that's confused, I want to explain.
[01:55:27.814 --> 01:55:32.838]  Why are elites, why are billionaires, why are the big bankers funding and always for this?
[01:55:32.918 --> 01:55:36.560]  I mean, people can't... they go, but communism's against rich people.
[01:55:36.861 --> 01:55:39.122]  Why are the rich guys funding it?
[01:55:39.142 --> 01:55:39.903]  Can you explain that?
[01:55:41.637 --> 01:55:49.021]  Yes, and I will explain that if you want to talk about, go from where we are in the future according to their program.
[01:55:49.581 --> 01:55:52.042]  And this gets broader than just the military transition.
[01:55:52.062 --> 01:55:52.823]  Yes, I want to do that.
[01:55:52.863 --> 01:55:53.283]  Let's do it.
[01:55:53.543 --> 01:55:53.903]  Okay.
[01:55:54.884 --> 01:56:01.647]  They had planned to have what they called a Commonwealth of Independent States by the year 2000.
[01:56:02.448 --> 01:56:07.130]  If you track the World Marxist Review and their own publications, you'll find that they have
[01:56:07.855 --> 01:56:09.596]  Agree that they have slipped a few years.
[01:56:09.816 --> 01:56:13.539]  Which is exactly what the bankers pushed was that world government by 2000.
[01:56:13.579 --> 01:56:14.079]  Yeah.
[01:56:14.799 --> 01:56:15.760]  Well, the CIS.
[01:56:16.200 --> 01:56:18.381]  And the Soviet Union calls it the CIS.
[01:56:19.802 --> 01:56:25.185]  And they plan to have the CIS by the year 2000.
[01:56:26.206 --> 01:56:28.467]  But that's the only date you'll find anywhere in the program.
[01:56:28.507 --> 01:56:30.608]  It's all accomplishing things as they go.
[01:56:31.069 --> 01:56:33.470]  Then you move into a period of globalism.
[01:56:33.730 --> 01:56:36.692]  They call it global corporate socialism.
[01:56:37.438 --> 01:56:42.879]  Well, you have global cartels for the distribution and production of goods and services.
[01:56:43.520 --> 01:56:46.881]  Then you move into a period of what they call interdependence.
[01:56:46.901 --> 01:56:50.381]  In other words, you're trying to establish interdependence.
[01:56:50.942 --> 01:56:53.222]  The WTO is working toward that, and it's right.
[01:56:53.642 --> 01:57:02.565]  So all these UN things are establishing this period of what they call a period of where they have a world socialist division of labor.
[01:57:02.945 --> 01:57:05.425]  From that, you can move into a withering way of the state.
[01:57:05.526 --> 01:57:07.186]  If you have a global organization,
[01:57:07.665 --> 01:57:11.248]  Controlling the World Socialist Division of Labor and World Trade.
[01:57:11.268 --> 01:57:13.390]  You don't need countries anymore.
[01:57:13.410 --> 01:57:14.270]  You don't need a state.
[01:57:14.651 --> 01:57:19.975]  And you can have international corporations run it all, who were behind it to begin with.
[01:57:20.295 --> 01:57:26.540]  The big money men behind it to begin with, taking over entire populations as their personal slaves.
[01:57:26.560 --> 01:57:30.183]  Then you move into what they call regional government.
[01:57:30.544 --> 01:57:31.464]  We've got a break, General.
[01:57:31.484 --> 01:57:31.905]  Stay with us.
[01:57:33.815 --> 01:57:39.620]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[01:57:39.660 --> 01:57:40.681]  Hello!
[01:57:50.110 --> 01:57:50.791]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.431 --> 01:57:52.552]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:53.193 --> 01:57:54.334]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.354 --> 01:57:55.815]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.536 --> 01:57:57.317]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:58.070 --> 01:58:01.872]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.253 --> 01:58:06.375]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:07.776 --> 01:58:09.096]  Defending liberty.
[01:58:10.057 --> 01:58:11.418]  Resisting tyranny.
[01:58:12.347 --> 01:58:16.110]  Standing up for our Constitutional Republic Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[01:58:16.130 --> 01:58:17.131]  until 2 p.m.
[01:58:17.171 --> 01:58:20.273]  back from 9 to midnight, all-time central standard.
[01:58:20.634 --> 01:58:24.797]  Big announcement, something big we're doing coming up the bottom of the hour after General Parton leaves us.
[01:58:25.317 --> 01:58:26.798]  We're honored to have him for another 30 minutes.
[01:58:27.379 --> 01:58:28.300]  There's so much to cover.
[01:58:30.144 --> 01:58:33.367]  And I don't want to take up all his time, so I don't even know if we'll take any calls, folks.
[01:58:34.188 --> 01:58:36.049]  Just so he has time to go over all of this.
[01:58:36.730 --> 01:58:38.872]  And these are official public plans.
[01:58:38.912 --> 01:58:44.076]  And what's scary is you look at something written 80 years ago, 70 years ago, 50 years ago, 30 years ago.
[01:58:44.136 --> 01:58:47.539]  It's being implemented exactly, but publicly under other names.
[01:58:48.405 --> 01:59:04.034]  And then you're going to have this worldwide system where no country has sovereignty, where these giant international governmental organizations are then handed over to private interest who rule over us as gods, and it's actually the multi-billionaire bankers that own and run it all, and the dumb liberals can't figure that out.
[01:59:04.094 --> 01:59:05.535]  Conservatives can't figure that out.
[01:59:05.835 --> 01:59:08.456]  We're all confused by the false terms they use.
[01:59:08.917 --> 01:59:16.341]  We're talking about this with General Benton K. Parton, former head of Air Force Weapons Development and also an expert on the Communist Third International and their program of total enslavement.
[01:59:16.781 --> 01:59:28.040]  We were getting to the point of explaining why is it always big money behind it and it's like Jiang Zemin said four years ago before he left office, I remember it, it was in BBC, he said
[01:59:28.800 --> 01:59:32.343]  Chinese capitalism is the greatest expression of communism.
[01:59:32.784 --> 01:59:35.446]  And that confused people, because they just manipulate terms.
[01:59:35.486 --> 01:59:37.528]  The Fortune 500 loves China.
[01:59:38.369 --> 01:59:47.317]  Bush is charging this woman, this Chinese-American doctor, who stood up to who, with a terrorism provision of the Patriot Act, intimidating a foreign official.
[01:59:47.917 --> 01:59:53.382]  So America is becoming what China is, and we're going to have the same type of system.
[01:59:54.143 --> 01:59:55.264]  General Parton, please continue.
[01:59:55.862 --> 02:00:04.270]  Well, after the withering away of the states, you have a global, you set up a global hierarchy of regional governments.
[02:00:04.611 --> 02:00:05.672]  That's regional governments.
[02:00:06.393 --> 02:00:10.897]  And that'll give you what they call World Communism, or the New World Order.
[02:00:10.917 --> 02:00:19.766]  That's a world without nations, no nations, a world without nationalities, a world without borders, a world without war, a world without competition.
[02:00:20.470 --> 02:00:26.474]  And with that system, you're supposed to have this so-called new socialist man developed out of that.
[02:00:26.774 --> 02:00:31.877]  And that's the new slave for the global owners, and then who are these?
[02:00:31.957 --> 02:00:33.218]  I mean, we know who's funding it.
[02:00:33.238 --> 02:00:34.799]  The richest people in the world are all behind it.
[02:00:34.839 --> 02:00:40.042]  I mean, obviously, this is a world without competition to their monopoly of control.
[02:00:40.182 --> 02:00:40.662]  That's right.
[02:00:41.022 --> 02:00:44.084]  Let me read you a little quote that's sort of singing your song.
[02:00:44.104 --> 02:00:47.246]  It's stated from a Canadian intelligence service made
[02:00:47.908 --> 02:01:07.321]  2001, and this is a quote saying essentially what you've been saying there, organized international socialism was always a temporary front for the objectives of international finance and the credit creation monopoly of the international banks is the ultimate cause of the threat facing civilization and mankind.
[02:01:07.541 --> 02:01:16.347]  They agree with a lot with what you've been saying there, but there is a system out there that is being used to make this transformation
[02:01:16.880 --> 02:01:21.662]  You look at, and let me make a broad statement, a little comment for all the Christians out there.
[02:01:21.682 --> 02:01:32.666]  The Constitution of the United States says, Congress shall make no law respecting religion, respecting the establishment of a religion, or the free exercise thereof.
[02:01:32.706 --> 02:01:34.466]  In other words, keep your hands off Congress.
[02:01:34.486 --> 02:01:35.227]  You can't do that.
[02:01:35.347 --> 02:01:36.907]  Prohibiting the free exercise thereof.
[02:01:37.067 --> 02:01:38.148]  Pardon me?
[02:01:38.168 --> 02:01:40.549]  Yes, prohibiting the free exercise thereof.
[02:01:41.309 --> 02:01:41.829]  Prohibiting?
[02:01:42.189 --> 02:01:42.369]  Yes.
[02:01:46.045 --> 02:01:47.846]  That's right, you're right.
[02:01:47.866 --> 02:01:49.988]  You cannot prohibit the free exercise thereof.
[02:01:50.308 --> 02:01:51.809]  Congress can make no laws there.
[02:01:52.129 --> 02:01:55.371]  If Congress can't make any laws there, a bureaucrat can't make that law either.
[02:01:55.391 --> 02:02:00.194]  And the misinterpretation of separation and church and state is the opposite of what the founders intended.
[02:02:00.335 --> 02:02:03.837]  Well, let me explain separation of church and state.
[02:02:03.897 --> 02:02:08.000]  It means the government makes no law and can do nothing, and churches are free to do whatever they want.
[02:02:08.160 --> 02:02:14.524]  No, let me say, the Soviet Constitution, the Soviet Union had three constitutions.
[02:02:15.757 --> 02:02:16.277]  First was 1918.
[02:02:16.477 --> 02:02:30.584]  Every one of them called for the separation of church and state, the separation of church and school, and guarantees the right of all citizens and the government to conduct anti-religious propaganda.
[02:02:30.964 --> 02:02:37.927]  Now, the name of the new organization for the old Soviet Union is the CIS, the Commonwealth of Independent States.
[02:02:37.947 --> 02:02:38.887]  Stay there, we gotta break again.
[02:02:38.947 --> 02:02:40.308]  Long segment coming up, General.
[02:02:40.608 --> 02:02:42.029]  Plenty of time to break this down.
[02:02:42.469 --> 02:02:43.710]  This is vital information.
[02:02:46.730 --> 02:02:49.572]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[02:02:49.832 --> 02:02:51.414]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[02:02:51.774 --> 02:02:56.437]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[02:02:56.778 --> 02:03:03.543]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[02:03:03.843 --> 02:03:05.825]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has arisen.
[02:03:06.025 --> 02:03:08.888]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[02:03:08.968 --> 02:03:13.632]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[02:03:13.832 --> 02:03:18.236]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[02:03:18.476 --> 02:03:25.703]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.

[02:03:56.966 --> 02:04:04.452]  The revolutionary Berkey Light, with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements, remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:04:04.772 --> 02:04:07.935]  Harmful or unwanted chemicals are reduced to below detectable levels.
[02:04:08.195 --> 02:04:13.937]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury, while leaving the nutritional minerals your body needs.

[02:04:52.696 --> 02:04:57.377]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Wright Frequency Technology.
[02:04:57.697 --> 02:05:05.339]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Wright discovered that disease organisms could be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:05:05.639 --> 02:05:12.501]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:05:12.721 --> 02:05:14.081]  There are no side effects!

[02:05:45.312 --> 02:05:50.354]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:05:50.714 --> 02:05:53.034]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:05:54.175 --> 02:06:07.539]  This just in, the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, Porter Goss, one of the secret CIA agents, we didn't even know he'd been in the CIA, when he was even on the Intelligence Committee for the House,
[02:06:08.354 --> 02:06:09.315]  He's now resigning.
[02:06:09.475 --> 02:06:10.756]  Very sneaky individual.
[02:06:11.897 --> 02:06:13.219]  Talking to General Benton K. Parton.
[02:06:13.499 --> 02:06:28.293]  General, you were getting into the Communist Third International's program of total enslavement that we're under through the bankers, and you raised separation of church and state, which is in a letter from Jefferson, not in the Constitution, Bill of Rights, Declaration of Independence, the First Amendment.
[02:06:28.783 --> 02:06:40.071]  Well, the Soviet Constitution, I said, there were three of them, and every one of them called for the separation of church and state, the separation of church and school, and guarantees the right of all citizens and the government to conduct anti-religious propaganda.
[02:06:57.246 --> 02:07:03.748]  A contrary or hostile system to religion and to political correctness.
[02:07:03.848 --> 02:07:13.751]  And political correctness is a communist term that was coined by Felix Dzerzhinsky when he was head of the Cheka, which was a precursor to the KGB.
[02:07:14.271 --> 02:07:24.174]  So the people in the United States and all the world are trying to use the communist idea of political correctness to oppose
[02:07:24.924 --> 02:07:30.247]  The Soviet Constitution, with respect to religion, on the United States and other countries too.
[02:07:30.607 --> 02:07:31.508]  That's what's happening.
[02:07:31.528 --> 02:07:36.551]  How many people have you heard talk about the separation of church and state in the Soviet Constitution?
[02:07:36.971 --> 02:07:38.492]  All three of them had the same thing.
[02:07:38.592 --> 02:07:43.795]  Well, an exercise for folks to go look at is to read the first ten planks of the Communist Manifesto.
[02:07:43.875 --> 02:07:48.918]  Public school, central bank, income tax, all of it is being implemented.
[02:07:51.710 --> 02:07:59.176]  The Communist Manifesto of 1848 was a propaganda piece to incite revolution all over Europe.
[02:07:59.736 --> 02:08:00.697]  That was his purpose.
[02:08:01.098 --> 02:08:02.218]  It was not a program.
[02:08:02.799 --> 02:08:09.805]  I understand you're saying it's a propaganda piece, but my point is, the planks in there, eight of them, have been implemented.
[02:08:09.925 --> 02:08:10.385]  Oh, sure.
[02:08:10.905 --> 02:08:11.146]  Sure.
[02:08:11.326 --> 02:08:17.991]  You'll find many of the things in the program of the Third International that predate 1848, the First International.
[02:08:20.993 --> 02:08:27.635]  Now obviously the British Royalty, the British elites have always been pushing this Thabian Socialism even before we saw it from
[02:08:29.150 --> 02:08:30.730]  From Marx and Engels and others.
[02:08:30.950 --> 02:08:37.132]  But I want to get into what the world will look like if they win and why it is elite bankers that are behind it.
[02:08:37.392 --> 02:08:39.312]  I mean, we see the regional governments.
[02:08:39.753 --> 02:08:43.594]  Spain, government controlled but privately held company.
[02:08:43.914 --> 02:08:46.134]  Juan Carlos owns a lot of stock in it, the King of Spain.
[02:08:46.554 --> 02:08:49.475]  Is going to be given almost all the major roads in Texas.
[02:08:49.495 --> 02:08:52.256]  $3 a gallon tax for the transponder.
[02:08:52.296 --> 02:08:53.416]  That's mainstream news.
[02:08:54.056 --> 02:08:56.538]  Foreign companies are buying up our water supplies.
[02:08:56.598 --> 02:08:58.680]  Communist Chinese in the Bahamas.
[02:08:58.780 --> 02:09:02.543]  Their military-controlled shipping concern is going to run the nuclear scanners.
[02:09:02.563 --> 02:09:04.444]  They've been given Long Beach, Panama Canal.
[02:09:05.205 --> 02:09:11.009]  At every level, regional government, global corporations are being given governmental powers in the Western world.
[02:09:11.389 --> 02:09:14.592]  Police state measures are being erected, international taxes.
[02:09:15.112 --> 02:09:19.573]  Every country that's not been taken over, and those countries that have been taken over, are moving in the process.
[02:09:42.094 --> 02:09:44.835]  And then our corporations aid them and censor for them.
[02:09:45.455 --> 02:09:47.175]  Well, you've got to face one thing.
[02:09:47.675 --> 02:09:56.537]  A number of the so-called multi-national corporations were set up back in the early part of this century to provide the seed bases for these global cartels.
[02:09:58.098 --> 02:10:02.039]  So a lot of them were set up originally for the seed bases for a global cartel.
[02:10:02.339 --> 02:10:07.200]  You've got a lot of global corporations set up, honest, legitimate, competitive businesses, too.
[02:10:08.407 --> 02:10:27.281]  And then at the same time, we have these global corporations giving campaign funds to our politicians who then get elected and then they take the government investments, which is over 70% of the stock market, and then they selectively make investments with the companies that are part of the New World Order.
[02:10:29.382 --> 02:10:33.145]  Well, the New World Order isn't just banking.
[02:10:34.198 --> 02:10:38.740]  No, I understand, sir, but I'm talking about those that have been funding it, and driving it, and supporting it.
[02:10:38.981 --> 02:10:49.726]  When one of these dumb liberals, who means well, says communism is going to help the average person, I found you can break their conditioning when you show them that it's big money funding communism.
[02:10:52.968 --> 02:10:58.651]  But communism wouldn't be as big as it is if they didn't have a lot of propaganda things that they were convincing the people of.
[02:10:59.875 --> 02:11:00.856]  Oh, I agree with you, sir.
[02:11:00.936 --> 02:11:07.561]  So, I mean, other points you want to make about if they were able to, which they have most of the planet, take over, where does it go from there?
[02:11:08.062 --> 02:11:11.004]  I mean, this perfected man is really a slave jellyfish.
[02:11:11.144 --> 02:11:21.592]  Well, as I indicated, what they're trying to do is move to this world communism or the New World Order, which is this world without nations, world without nationalities, world without borders, world without war, world without competition.
[02:11:21.972 --> 02:11:26.476]  It's a global hierarchy of regional governments, controlled without democratic processes.
[02:11:27.695 --> 02:11:28.616]  A global tyranny.
[02:11:29.036 --> 02:11:41.143]  Why do communists, when they get in control of China or Russia, and they're not even being opposed, and they kill people when they first get in to get control when they are being opposed, but as soon as they get total power, they just start slaughtering in mass?
[02:11:41.683 --> 02:11:45.245]  I mean, why would you surround Ukrainian villages and starve 15 million people?
[02:11:45.305 --> 02:11:47.627]  I mean, why do they love to murder people so much?
[02:11:47.947 --> 02:11:56.612]  Well, if you look in what happened in Rwanda, the number one mass weapon that has been, mass killing weapon that has been used, the number one,
[02:11:57.293 --> 02:11:58.034]  It's a machete.
[02:11:59.295 --> 02:12:02.238]  They killed a million people in about three to four weeks in Rwanda.
[02:12:02.618 --> 02:12:02.978]  Remember?
[02:12:04.080 --> 02:12:06.962]  Three to four weeks, a million people, and most of them were killed with machetes.
[02:12:07.082 --> 02:12:08.203]  And Clinton did nothing?
[02:12:08.744 --> 02:12:15.430]  Well, the present head of the United Nations was over all these security forces, and he pulled the European troops out.
[02:12:15.851 --> 02:12:17.272]  When the violence started, he pulled them out.
[02:12:17.392 --> 02:12:20.295]  Buthros, Buthros, golly, then we got Kofi Annan.
[02:12:21.016 --> 02:12:25.158]  Well, Coffey, Anon, was head of the... He was the head guy doing it, yeah.
[02:12:25.258 --> 02:12:31.501]  He was the head guy who pulled the forces out of that country when the butchery started.
[02:12:33.202 --> 02:12:38.944]  And again, that was a minority group that had land holdings, the Christians, being targeted by the Hutus.
[02:12:39.144 --> 02:12:41.325]  They were mostly animist and communist.
[02:12:43.166 --> 02:12:47.628]  The Hutus were animist and communist, and the Tutsis were the Christians.
[02:12:48.496 --> 02:12:52.537]  And they were successful because they didn't have those degenerate, weak cultures.
[02:12:52.817 --> 02:12:56.958]  I mean, the Christian system always produces more wealth.
[02:12:57.498 --> 02:12:59.538]  And they were disarmed, too.
[02:12:59.878 --> 02:13:00.879]  The people were disarmed.
[02:13:01.779 --> 02:13:05.520]  Well, I've read the reports, and I've read the new commission reports even out of Africa.
[02:13:05.560 --> 02:13:12.941]  The UN would put the Tootsies in a big camp, aim machine guns at them at night so they couldn't get out, and let the Hutus come in and kill them.
[02:13:12.961 --> 02:13:15.322]  They didn't just pull the troops or turn a blind eye.
[02:13:15.342 --> 02:13:15.862]  They helped!
[02:13:18.664 --> 02:13:19.585]  It was a bloody mess.
[02:13:20.646 --> 02:13:21.787]  Over a million people.
[02:13:22.347 --> 02:13:23.328]  Over a million people.
[02:13:23.849 --> 02:13:31.576]  Let me give you an example about a country that has just made the transition fairly recently to socialism, and that's South Africa.
[02:13:32.616 --> 02:13:38.101]  The period, the preparatory phase ended when Nelson Mandela was let out of jail.
[02:13:38.622 --> 02:13:42.225]  And you moved into the period of escalating violence when he was let out of jail.
[02:13:42.665 --> 02:13:45.508]  Remember when you had all the necklacing and killing all those people?
[02:13:46.523 --> 02:13:48.565]  Is his wife murdering children?
[02:13:48.825 --> 02:13:50.587]  Most of it was black on black.
[02:13:51.788 --> 02:13:54.970]  Necklacing with tires soaked in gasoline.
[02:13:55.891 --> 02:14:02.417]  And there was about 18,500 of those cases of homicides.
[02:14:03.157 --> 02:14:09.142]  When Nelson, the period of escalating violence ended when Mandela was elected president.
[02:14:10.223 --> 02:14:12.445]  And the level of violence continued to climb.
[02:14:13.405 --> 02:14:31.796]  And I commissioned a little study by somebody in South Africa to pull together the official figures of how many homicides were they having in South Africa, and I wanted to point on a chart that I had with a curve on it, and I wanted to point on that chart for South Africa.
[02:14:32.516 --> 02:14:35.338]  And for South Africa in the year 2003, the figure was 25,000 a year!
[02:14:41.272 --> 02:14:50.877]  And the French international intelligence police organization, Metropole, said it was not 25,000 a year, it was closer to 50,000.
[02:14:52.118 --> 02:14:57.080]  But the official South African government figures was 25,000 a year.
[02:14:57.120 --> 02:14:59.401]  Well, look what Mugabe's doing, it's the same.
[02:14:59.461 --> 02:14:59.762]  Sure.
[02:15:00.522 --> 02:15:01.142]  But, sure.
[02:15:02.143 --> 02:15:02.383]  Sure.
[02:15:02.443 --> 02:15:05.024]  It's a stretched out, warm national liberation strategy.
[02:15:05.224 --> 02:15:10.107]  You take off, gradually you go through all those things, eliminating opposition, re-schooling,
[02:15:10.580 --> 02:15:19.806]  But they've learned a long time ago to stretch those things out to keep everything from totally collapsing instantaneously, like it did in the Soviet Union.
[02:15:20.547 --> 02:15:28.992]  You know, high-level communists do it because they get power and control out of it, but the mid-level ones, they've got to know that it's a murdering, horrible system.
[02:15:29.052 --> 02:15:30.693]  And they still defend it, though, General.
[02:15:30.733 --> 02:15:31.994]  They just love it.
[02:15:32.655 --> 02:15:34.756]  Well, that's where they're bread and butter, you know.
[02:15:34.976 --> 02:15:37.838]  Or then they claim that it's all lies, the communists haven't killed anyone.
[02:15:38.502 --> 02:15:50.290]  I was in a place in Hawaii back in January, and there was a guy there who was in Somalia, you know, the town of Black Hawk Down?
[02:15:51.070 --> 02:15:51.351]  Yes.
[02:15:51.591 --> 02:16:03.398]  And I know the book that I had written on the sign of Soviet split, I had indicated where the communists were in their takeover in Somalia, what they were doing and where they were in the takeover, and that was written in 1966-67.
[02:16:03.418 --> 02:16:03.619]  But in 68,
[02:16:07.865 --> 02:16:11.307]  They moved to consolidate power.
[02:16:11.708 --> 02:16:15.850]  There's another guy who was there with him who was a friend over in Somalia at the time.
[02:16:15.890 --> 02:16:20.053]  He was visiting from Canada, and he was working for the KGB in Somalia.
[02:16:21.534 --> 02:16:32.741]  And I asked him, what did they do in the first four or five steps that they did when they moved to take over, consolidate power, at the end of the period of escalating violence?
[02:16:33.382 --> 02:16:33.902]  And he said,
[02:16:34.341 --> 02:16:36.403]  They secularized the state over a weekend.
[02:16:36.723 --> 02:16:53.194]  They rounded up the 10 Muslim leaders and took them to the public square and executed them, and picked up 2,400 young people in Somalia and hauled them back to Russia to train them and bring them back to take over and run the government.
[02:16:53.334 --> 02:16:55.036]  And several other things that they did.
[02:16:55.576 --> 02:17:00.560]  But, you know, that transition from the period of escalating violence to
[02:17:01.778 --> 02:17:05.361]  Period of exploitation is very, very bloody.
[02:17:05.801 --> 02:17:06.302]  Very bloody.
[02:17:07.322 --> 02:17:11.706]  When we come back in closing, you'll have five minutes, General, whatever the issues you want to cover then, sir.
[02:17:12.626 --> 02:17:14.928]  Hey, we've talked about a lot of discouraging things.
[02:17:14.968 --> 02:17:17.050]  Let's talk about what we've got to do to change it.
[02:17:17.070 --> 02:17:20.192]  We'll spend some time on solutions with General Partin, then I'll make my big announcement.
[02:17:20.212 --> 02:17:28.879]  When we come back from the bottom of the Almer, that's about, well, it's exactly 13 minutes and 20 seconds away from that announcement.
[02:17:29.565 --> 02:17:30.346]  So stay with us.
[02:17:30.366 --> 02:17:34.849]  The websites are InfoWars.com, InfoWars.net, and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:17:34.869 --> 02:17:37.911]  We're also updating JonesReport.com every day now.
[02:17:37.971 --> 02:17:38.831]  It's an excellent site.
[02:17:39.152 --> 02:17:39.952]  Be sure and check it out.
[02:17:39.972 --> 02:17:40.993]  Put it in your list of favorites.
[02:17:41.333 --> 02:17:42.354]  JonesReport.com.
[02:17:47.378 --> 02:17:48.419]  The War on Terrorism.
[02:17:48.739 --> 02:17:51.522]  Will it be fought overseas, or will it affect us here at home?
[02:17:51.802 --> 02:17:55.946]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[02:17:56.386 --> 02:17:57.207]  So what do you do?
[02:17:57.528 --> 02:18:02.092]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[02:18:02.577 --> 02:18:04.698]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[02:18:05.198 --> 02:18:19.886]  Sheltering in Place, Surviving Acts of Terrorism from Biological, Chemical, and Radioactive Fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[02:18:19.926 --> 02:18:26.990]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[02:18:27.350 --> 02:18:31.754]  Get this critical video every American needs for only $29 plus shipping.
[02:18:32.194 --> 02:18:33.975]  Order by calling New Millennium today at 888-803-4438.
[02:18:33.995 --> 02:18:34.216]  That's 888-803-4438.

[02:18:47.407 --> 02:18:48.469]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:18:48.869 --> 02:18:54.356]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[02:18:54.937 --> 02:18:55.438]  That's right.
[02:18:55.738 --> 02:18:58.041]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[02:18:59.443 --> 02:19:05.511]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[02:19:06.067 --> 02:19:13.775]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[02:19:14.195 --> 02:19:19.020]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[02:19:19.677 --> 02:19:24.700]  If you'd like to take a look at gold pre-retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[02:19:25.481 --> 02:19:29.623]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[02:19:30.004 --> 02:19:30.244]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:19:30.264 --> 02:19:32.205]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[02:19:32.265 --> 02:19:32.565]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:19:32.866 --> 02:19:33.146]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:19:51.554 --> 02:19:56.756]  One of America's greatest patriots, Patrick Henry, said, give me liberty or give me death.
[02:19:57.697 --> 02:20:10.922]  It was Patrick Henry who forced the Bill of Rights to be added to the Constitution, your unalienable or unchangeable right to religious freedom, freedom of the press, freedom of speech, or the right to own a gun.
[02:20:11.722 --> 02:20:17.004]  There are certain movements underway to strip you of these unalienable, unchangeable rights today.
[02:20:17.904 --> 02:20:25.189]  To help you grasp the loss of these freedoms, we'll send you absolutely free a one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[02:20:25.950 --> 02:20:26.490]  Just call 1-800-516-8736.
[02:20:26.510 --> 02:20:26.811]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[02:20:26.851 --> 02:20:28.612]  It's absolutely free.
[02:20:28.812 --> 02:20:32.595]  Operators are standing by to assist you.
[02:20:32.635 --> 02:20:33.215]  Just call right now.
[02:20:45.436 --> 02:20:51.448]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism, but globalism.
[02:20:51.468 --> 02:20:54.334]  Globalists are concerned with what's good for big business.
[02:21:00.196 --> 02:21:00.737]  I think so.
[02:21:23.080 --> 02:21:23.260]  Thank you.
[02:21:54.128 --> 02:22:00.552]  General Benton J. Barton, former head of Air Force Weapons Development, aeronautical engineer, chemical engineer.
[02:22:02.673 --> 02:22:07.836]  It seems like the New World Order's program is behind schedule, having a lot of resistance worldwide.
[02:22:07.856 --> 02:22:11.358]  The neocons just aren't getting it done for them.
[02:22:12.119 --> 02:22:13.319]  Right now, even having the U.S.
[02:22:13.359 --> 02:22:14.320]  as an engine for them,
[02:22:15.497 --> 02:22:18.199]  Do you think that they're in danger of failing?
[02:22:18.999 --> 02:22:22.822]  And then please tell us about any ideas you've got for solutions.
[02:22:23.722 --> 02:22:32.047]  They're not very far behind when you consider that they have planned for years to have this status at the CIS of the year 2000.
[02:22:32.667 --> 02:22:33.848]  They weren't very far off.
[02:22:34.989 --> 02:22:38.811]  So they're moving on very progressively and very, very rapidly.
[02:22:39.351 --> 02:22:40.372]  And with the
[02:22:41.016 --> 02:22:50.563]  Their orchestrated generation of the fuel situation that we have now, plus other things, they're still making an awful lot of progress.
[02:22:51.703 --> 02:22:54.485]  There are a lot of people out there who have all kinds of solutions.
[02:22:54.505 --> 02:23:00.690]  You talk to people in the Christian community, they'll say, well, if we can't do anything about it, we ought to have a revival, and if we don't have that, everything is done.
[02:23:01.390 --> 02:23:03.672]  And there are all kinds of solutions out there.
[02:23:04.212 --> 02:23:08.555]  But from my analysis, and what I've seen, and what I've done in the political area,
[02:23:09.230 --> 02:23:16.056]  I see no solution out there unless we get out there, the good people get involved in the political process and take the system back.
[02:23:16.476 --> 02:23:24.383]  You have federal laws, you have state laws that enable you to get involved in the political process and take the system back.
[02:23:25.384 --> 02:23:34.271]  I got very involved in the political business right after I retired and I ran and became chairman of the Fairfax County Republican Committee, which is
[02:23:34.918 --> 02:23:39.020]  Two, over two congressional districts, and I was told it was the biggest political unit in the country.
[02:23:39.040 --> 02:23:45.662]  I don't know whether it is or not, but I sort of scientifically went after the system.
[02:23:45.822 --> 02:23:59.628]  What can we do to really get the good guys into control and into replacing all these left-wing people who are in high positions in elected office and having a double tongue and talking about things?
[02:24:00.408 --> 02:24:04.070]  And I prepared a precinct manual and
[02:24:06.468 --> 02:24:12.050]  We distributed that and I set up a process where we're trying to get one block kept in for every 25 homes.
[02:24:12.070 --> 02:24:26.394]  Heck, in Fairfax County we had about 225 precincts and we set up a system whereby we could deliver in a precinct, you could deliver a precinct.
[02:24:26.494 --> 02:24:31.196]  Well that's what the communists say, think locally or think locally, act globally.
[02:24:32.372 --> 02:24:33.153]  No, that's not the saying.
[02:24:33.193 --> 02:24:33.534]  What is it?
[02:24:33.614 --> 02:24:34.975]  Act locally, think globally.
[02:24:35.515 --> 02:24:46.686]  Well, the precinct that elects the people at the town hall, at the city hall, at the county, is the same precinct that elects the President of the United States.
[02:24:47.662 --> 02:24:48.643]  So it's a continuum.
[02:24:49.604 --> 02:24:53.227]  Well, I mean, everybody I talk to has the same main solution.
[02:24:53.547 --> 02:24:58.231]  We have 60% turnout in presidential elections, but then 8% on average nationally, locally.
[02:24:58.592 --> 02:25:00.033]  The power is local.
[02:25:00.133 --> 02:25:05.178]  We can take over there if people just stop talking about it and keep... Do it.
[02:25:05.578 --> 02:25:09.001]  Organize and do it and become a part of an organization that is doing it.
[02:25:09.201 --> 02:25:18.848]  And then if you're there at the Water District, you're there at the County Commissioners, you're there at the City Council, you're there, you're at every level, you're elected, then you can hold back this stuff that's happening.
[02:25:18.888 --> 02:25:21.750]  We have to physically put ourselves against the machine.
[02:25:22.190 --> 02:25:31.576]  Well, I will say when I was Chairman of the County, the first time I ran, I had 55% on the County Committee, and the second time I ran I had 85%.
[02:25:33.679 --> 02:25:39.908]  And believe me, it was a lot easier to get two senators and three congressmen on the phone than it was to get the pastor of my church.
[02:25:39.928 --> 02:25:47.397]  Well, General, you know, I make films, I do radio shows every day, I work 16 hours a day on average, sometimes more, but... Is that all?
[02:25:48.078 --> 02:25:50.301]  That's all, but I can't do everything.
[02:25:51.342 --> 02:25:51.823]  It takes leadership.
[02:25:51.843 --> 02:25:54.105]  You can't leave it up to the lowest common denominator.
[02:26:18.120 --> 02:26:21.261]  You've got the energy and the smarts to get out there and lead something.
[02:26:22.041 --> 02:26:24.141]  And the same thing is in the political structure.
[02:26:24.182 --> 02:26:33.004]  You try to get smart people into positions at the block captain level, the precinct level, or the district level, or the county level, city level, wherever.
[02:26:33.444 --> 02:26:37.985]  You try to get... but the basic unit of votes is the precinct!
[02:26:38.125 --> 02:26:40.385]  How many of the communists would you say are useful idiots?
[02:26:45.767 --> 02:26:46.007]  Well...
[02:26:48.780 --> 02:26:49.281]  I don't know.
[02:26:49.441 --> 02:26:53.625]  There are probably a heck of a lot more useful idiots out there than there are communists.
[02:26:55.307 --> 02:26:55.767]  I understand.
[02:26:55.807 --> 02:26:59.711]  I just don't know how they find so many evil people to try to carry out their designs.
[02:26:59.771 --> 02:27:03.795]  General Parton, we've got to get you up in the near future for a full hour just on solutions.
[02:27:03.915 --> 02:27:07.459]  I really want to thank you for spending your time with us.
[02:27:07.639 --> 02:27:08.940]  You work so hard for this country.
[02:27:09.321 --> 02:27:10.001]  And God bless you.
[02:27:10.021 --> 02:27:10.982]  We'll talk to you very soon.
[02:27:11.182 --> 02:27:11.503]  Thank you.
[02:27:11.903 --> 02:27:12.203]  You bet.
[02:27:12.243 --> 02:27:12.604]  Take care.
[02:27:13.797 --> 02:27:16.038]  All right, that was a great interview with General Bettencourt.
[02:27:16.098 --> 02:27:17.519]  I'd like to have him up a few times a year.
[02:27:17.539 --> 02:27:20.201]  We'll have him back up again soon to talk about Oklahoma City.
[02:27:20.221 --> 02:27:21.061]  He's always gracious.
[02:27:21.602 --> 02:27:23.283]  Big announcement on the other side of this.
[02:27:23.743 --> 02:27:24.443]  Quick break.
[02:27:24.963 --> 02:27:26.284]  Get your pens and paper ready.
[02:27:26.765 --> 02:27:27.785]  Get your ears on.
[02:27:28.686 --> 02:27:30.186]  This is very, very important.
[02:27:30.687 --> 02:27:31.467]  We'll be right back.
[02:27:36.370 --> 02:27:37.271]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.751 --> 02:27:39.352]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:40.292 --> 02:27:42.954]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.590 --> 02:27:48.932]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here with an important question.
[02:27:49.192 --> 02:27:51.213]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[02:27:51.373 --> 02:27:58.417]  I mean real hard to find all natural pure soap that contains no dyes, perfumes, deodorants, detergents, or other dangerous toxins.
[02:27:58.698 --> 02:28:07.283]  The Calbin Pure Soap Company, for the past 57 years, has been making triple concentrated pure soaps exclusively for healthcare professionals and hospitals.

[02:28:46.764 --> 02:28:49.746]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[02:28:50.106 --> 02:28:58.930]  It's portable and requires no water pressure so you can enjoy healthy drinking water whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[02:28:59.251 --> 02:29:03.933]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[02:29:04.393 --> 02:29:11.115]  The Berkelot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[02:29:11.515 --> 02:29:23.299]  It also removes foul taste and odors, like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals, like lead and mercury, while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:29:23.779 --> 02:29:28.223]  The Berkey Light's rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.

[02:29:46.659 --> 02:29:47.480]  Come on, Bill.
[02:29:47.700 --> 02:29:52.882]  Two weeks ago you were riding a bicycle, and today you're showing up in your new car and telling me you're buying a house.
[02:29:53.202 --> 02:29:54.703]  What did you do, rob Bill Gates?
[02:29:54.803 --> 02:29:56.783]  No, John, I didn't rob Bill Gates.
[02:29:57.064 --> 02:30:02.586]  What I did do is visit the website www.DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[02:30:02.866 --> 02:30:09.129]  That's where I learn how to make $3,000 to $9,000 each and every week, starting with my very first week.
[02:30:09.449 --> 02:30:11.670]  It's a simple program that does all the work for you.
[02:30:11.970 --> 02:30:14.831]  And get this, they guarantee my success in writing.
[02:30:15.331 --> 02:30:18.773]  I'm already up to $25,000 just going on my third week!
[02:30:19.013 --> 02:30:19.453]  Whoa!
[02:30:19.813 --> 02:30:21.034]  What was that website again?
[02:30:21.094 --> 02:30:24.575]  It's www.DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[02:30:24.875 --> 02:30:25.996]  Now write this down, John.
[02:30:26.136 --> 02:30:30.438]  You should go there and learn how this program can help you become financially independent, too.
[02:30:30.578 --> 02:30:31.158]  Thanks, Bill.
[02:30:31.438 --> 02:30:32.638]  I'm going there right now.
[02:30:33.039 --> 02:30:33.679]  Check, please!
[02:30:35.466 --> 02:30:36.927]  Uh, you got this one, right, Bill?
[02:30:37.427 --> 02:30:38.007]  Sure, John.
[02:30:38.227 --> 02:30:42.589]  Don't forget, it's www.DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[02:30:42.889 --> 02:30:44.610]  Next time, you'll be buying me lunch.
[02:30:44.750 --> 02:30:45.110]  Deal.
[02:30:48.592 --> 02:30:59.577]  They railed against the crowd with another red tag band.
[02:31:12.666 --> 02:31:13.826]  Welcome back my friends.
[02:31:18.968 --> 02:31:28.771]  One of my friends, a few months ago, one of my associates, you may have heard him on this broadcast, the name will go unnoticed,
[02:31:29.625 --> 02:31:39.248]  I had the idea to have a 9-11 Symposium documentary film screening in Los Angeles, California.
[02:31:40.108 --> 02:31:45.310]  And so for the last few weeks I've been working on this, setting it up, getting the hotel, lining up the speakers.
[02:31:46.590 --> 02:31:49.391]  Doesn't matter where you live in the country, you want to come to this event.
[02:31:49.411 --> 02:31:56.233]  And normally a two-day conference, it'll be June 24th and 25th in downtown Los Angeles, would be about $200.
[02:31:56.273 --> 02:31:56.713]  We're charging only
[02:32:00.166 --> 02:32:01.267]  Seventy-four dollars.
[02:32:01.447 --> 02:32:02.347]  You get two tickets.
[02:32:02.387 --> 02:32:03.508]  They're $62 apiece.
[02:32:03.668 --> 02:32:05.309]  Three to four tickets, $54 apiece.
[02:32:05.629 --> 02:32:08.650]  Five or more tickets for groups $34.50 each.
[02:32:10.291 --> 02:32:13.833]  And we're doing that so that it's affordable to come to it.
[02:32:14.674 --> 02:32:17.275]  I've never done a 9-11 meeting.
[02:32:17.395 --> 02:32:21.077]  I'm going to go to one that's happening in Chicago early next month.
[02:32:22.818 --> 02:32:26.060]  But folks, you really want to come to this event.
[02:32:26.120 --> 02:32:26.620]  It's going to be
[02:32:27.603 --> 02:32:28.484]  It's going to be wonderful.
[02:32:28.824 --> 02:32:38.250]  We're also going to make a documentary out of it, and we're going to have question and answers, roundtable discussions, a bunch of scholarly speakers on the controlled implosions of the buildings.
[02:32:38.270 --> 02:32:45.014]  We're going to have scholarly speakers on the neocon agenda, scholarly speakers on the history of government-sponsored terrorism, my new film.
[02:32:45.354 --> 02:32:47.195]  Let me just read our little releases here.
[02:32:47.736 --> 02:32:48.997]  We just put it up about an hour ago.
[02:32:49.017 --> 02:32:55.901]  You can buy tickets right now online through one of the big secure online ticket companies at InfoWars.com.
[02:32:57.080 --> 02:33:02.841]  And 9-1-1 and the Neocon Agenda is the name of the forum.
[02:33:03.341 --> 02:33:10.003]  National Education and Research Conference, Two Days of Truth, Face the Facts is its alternate title.
[02:33:10.663 --> 02:33:22.966]  In June 2006, researchers, scholars, journalists, media personalities, and average folks will come together from all over the USA to gather in Los Angeles to invite the rest of the world to examine the facts of 9-11.
[02:33:24.676 --> 02:33:37.948]  Through powerful and insightful presentations from prominent guest speakers and riveting documentary screenings, we will examine the NEOCON agenda and 9-1-1 as the pretext for the brutal ongoing war in Iraq as well as the establishment of future plans.
[02:33:39.289 --> 02:33:40.210]  Future operations.
[02:33:41.431 --> 02:33:43.293]  The implementation of future plans, we should say.
[02:33:43.953 --> 02:33:48.517]  This is guaranteed to be unlike any other conference of its kind, the first one ever presented by Alex Jones.
[02:33:48.537 --> 02:33:48.858]  That's me.
[02:33:49.631 --> 02:33:58.136]  The progenitor of the 9-11 Truth Movement, who was the first to speak out and challenge the government's official story of what happened on 9-11.
[02:34:00.497 --> 02:34:08.982]  Come and experience the biggest ever 9-11 conference, more highly respected speakers than any other, more amazing films than any other, plus special surprise guests.
[02:34:09.142 --> 02:34:18.367]  Come to learn, come to shape, and come to help each other create new strategies to defend the Constitution and save the Republic from the grip of its greatest enemy.
[02:34:19.682 --> 02:34:28.347]  Participation in this event is not limited to those who are already awake to the 9-11 Truth Movement, but is open to all who have questions about the official story or who want to learn more.
[02:34:28.947 --> 02:34:36.151]  We also invite the mainstream media to join us as fellow truth seekers and face the facts about the events surrounding September 11, 2001.
[02:34:36.211 --> 02:34:41.274]  If you ever only attend one 9-11 event, make sure this is it.
[02:34:41.854 --> 02:34:42.574]  There will also be the
[02:34:47.984 --> 02:34:49.744]  debut of my new documentary film.
[02:34:50.064 --> 02:35:05.947]  We are proud to announce that among many incredible politically charged documentaries being screened at the American Scholars Symposium, we will be featuring the premiere of the newest and most powerful film documentary produced ever by myself.
[02:35:06.187 --> 02:35:09.048]  And I'm telling you, it's going to be the best video I've ever made.
[02:35:10.688 --> 02:35:17.069]  Jones has been quietly working on his newest documentary for months in his production studio in Austin, where I sit right now.
[02:35:18.200 --> 02:35:25.162]  Keeping even the title under wraps until the premiere at the American Scholars Symposium conference in June of 2006.
[02:35:26.203 --> 02:35:35.506]  And if you go to InfoWars.com, you can email any questions you have to conference at InfoWars.com.
[02:35:35.526 --> 02:35:37.707]  That's conference at InfoWars.com.
[02:35:38.778 --> 02:35:42.580]  Or info at AmericanScholarsSymposium.org.
[02:35:42.620 --> 02:35:49.042]  We have a new website AmericanScholarsSymposium.org or you can just go to InfoWars.com.
[02:35:49.602 --> 02:35:56.205]  There's a big banner right in the middle of the page that takes you to AmericanScholarsSymposium.org.
[02:35:56.225 --> 02:36:00.687]  In the next few hours it will be linked on PrisonPlanet.tv, PrisonPlanet.com,
[02:36:02.131 --> 02:36:12.720]  Infowars.net, JonesReport.com, the MySpace, forward slash, Infowarrior site, and every other allied site out there that wants to support us.
[02:36:12.860 --> 02:36:19.065]  I'm asking all of you, I'm going to write a press release over the weekend, maybe even today, to get our press release out to everyone.
[02:36:19.085 --> 02:36:20.185]  We'll be up very soon.
[02:36:20.205 --> 02:36:21.767]  In fact, I'm deciding right now.
[02:36:21.807 --> 02:36:23.408]  I'll just, I'll write it when I get off the air.
[02:36:24.849 --> 02:36:29.613]  And we need to get this out to everyone, every indie media group, every 9-11 group, everybody out there.
[02:36:31.727 --> 02:36:41.754]  And folks, I mean, I can have eight screenings of my documentary film in big movie theaters here in Austin, and sometimes they sell out in days.
[02:36:42.275 --> 02:36:43.656]  I don't know what's going to happen in L.A.
[02:36:44.396 --> 02:36:46.578]  It seats over a thousand.
[02:36:47.058 --> 02:36:50.280]  We're having it at the downtown Sheraton, the L.A.
[02:36:50.420 --> 02:36:51.301]  Sheraton downtown.
[02:36:51.341 --> 02:36:52.322]  It's a four-star hotel.
[02:36:53.211 --> 02:37:03.657]  And we're also going to post on the site, there's a rate where you save, I think it's $65 a night that you save when you sign up through the special number that I believe we have on the site.
[02:37:03.677 --> 02:37:04.938]  If it isn't there, it'll be up later.
[02:37:06.219 --> 02:37:12.222]  And we're also going to list, we're building the site right now, I mean it's basically done, but we're going to be adding more updates.
[02:37:12.702 --> 02:37:17.345]  We'll list hotels and motels from $50 up to $5, that's what you want.
[02:37:17.966 --> 02:37:20.207]  In the surrounding area, within a mile of it, there are
[02:37:20.942 --> 02:37:22.303]  Dozens and dozens of hotels.
[02:37:22.343 --> 02:37:35.933]  It's right in the hotel conference district where they have a lot of the big conferences and the other large meetings, the auto shows, all of it is held right there in the area.
[02:37:36.234 --> 02:37:38.856]  What's the word I'm looking for?
[02:37:40.597 --> 02:37:43.779]  They don't just hold conferences in the area, they hold the big conventions, yes.
[02:37:44.420 --> 02:37:45.841]  But ours is not a convention.
[02:37:46.653 --> 02:37:52.042]  So I would recommend that so many times I'll have a movie showing in Austin or I'll go to an event in another city.
[02:37:52.082 --> 02:37:53.705]  I've only done a few events in other areas.
[02:37:53.725 --> 02:37:55.668]  This is very rare for us to do.
[02:37:57.558 --> 02:38:25.221]  and uh... people are lined up sometimes two hundred deep outside who thought they could come by tickets at the door now we'll tell you know the day i fly out there on that friday if there's any tickets left and there may be uh... and you'll be able to buy them at the door but i wouldn't count on that happening by the way a lot of you don't go on the computer you don't purchase things over the computer you can go to the secure safe online ticketing service and get your tickets right now you get an email confirmation with your ticket number that is your ticket
[02:38:26.085 --> 02:38:30.689]  If you want to call our toll-free number, we will take down your name, your number, your email if you have it.
[02:38:31.310 --> 02:38:42.579]  All of that, we will mail you a physical ticket and if you order by phone the last few days, we'll just download those and have your ticket there as roll call at the door and that ticket will be good for the two days.
[02:38:42.920 --> 02:38:48.484]  It starts on Saturday the 24th of June and runs from noon until 8 or 9 at night.
[02:38:48.745 --> 02:38:50.286]  We put noon to 8, but it'll probably
[02:38:50.586 --> 02:38:52.668]  Probably go to about 10 at night.
[02:38:52.968 --> 02:39:01.394]  The Sheraton is built onto a large shopping mall, a nice shopping mall and movie theaters with a whole bunch of restaurants.
[02:39:01.414 --> 02:39:03.215]  There's three big restaurants in the hotel.
[02:39:04.412 --> 02:39:14.339]  And there are, again, I was looking it up the other day, there's a whole food court and a bunch of other restaurants in the, you know, adjoining hotels built on the shopping mall.
[02:39:14.940 --> 02:39:27.489]  So, if your wife doesn't want to go to the conference and she wants, or your husband doesn't, or if your husband wants to go play golf, just bring him with you and then you can go see the conference and they can go run your credit card up at the shopping mall.
[02:39:27.809 --> 02:39:28.650]  Just joking, folks.
[02:39:30.331 --> 02:39:31.472]  We all know how our wives are.
[02:39:31.532 --> 02:39:32.032]  I'm joking.
[02:39:32.072 --> 02:39:33.053]  My wife's very frugal.
[02:39:33.073 --> 02:39:33.913]  I'm the one that spends money.
[02:39:34.173 --> 02:39:35.274]  I'm just teasing, honey.
[02:39:35.614 --> 02:39:36.274]  I'm just teasing.
[02:39:37.195 --> 02:39:39.676]  But, of course, I'll be the match of ceremonies.
[02:39:39.696 --> 02:39:40.396]  I'll give a keynote.
[02:39:40.416 --> 02:39:42.758]  The speech should be about an hour and a half long.
[02:39:42.778 --> 02:39:43.898]  I'm probably going to have to do a PowerPoint.
[02:39:43.918 --> 02:39:46.159]  I want to do a PowerPoint, but I'm finishing this other film.
[02:39:46.740 --> 02:39:51.882]  This new film I'm making, by the way, the individual basically volunteered just for the price of the orchestra.
[02:39:52.503 --> 02:39:53.843]  I'm having a very famous...
[02:39:57.652 --> 02:40:00.113]  We're going to show it for the first time ever!
[02:40:00.133 --> 02:40:00.454]  At this event.
[02:40:27.120 --> 02:40:29.161]  And we're going to have two movie screens in there.
[02:40:29.201 --> 02:40:30.622]  So it's projected on two screens.
[02:40:30.862 --> 02:40:31.863]  We're going to show Loose Change 2.
[02:40:32.123 --> 02:40:33.043]  Dylan Avery will be there.
[02:40:33.403 --> 02:40:35.464]  And a little something special Dylan's bringing.
[02:40:35.525 --> 02:40:38.646]  Something that won't be seen until that point as well.
[02:40:38.666 --> 02:40:39.447]  That's all I can say.
[02:40:40.847 --> 02:40:48.711]  And we're going to show excerpts of Marshall Law and several other documentary filmmakers that we want to have there that we're lining up that will go unnamed at this time.
[02:40:49.132 --> 02:40:51.333]  So we're looking at at least four films being screened.
[02:40:53.254 --> 02:40:55.335]  And we're also looking
[02:40:57.502 --> 02:40:58.943]  Guaranteed four films to be screened.
[02:40:58.983 --> 02:41:03.107]  We already have the former head of the Star Wars program.
[02:41:03.127 --> 02:41:06.830]  We just had the former head of Air Force Weapons Development and Energy Directed Weapons on for you.
[02:41:06.910 --> 02:41:10.673]  I might even invite Parton to talk about Oklahoma City.
[02:41:10.933 --> 02:41:13.795]  We have confirmed Dr. Bob Bowman.
[02:41:15.096 --> 02:41:17.158]  He will be there with a keynote on Sunday.
[02:41:18.089 --> 02:41:22.831]  He's having his, what is it, 40th or 50th wedding anniversary on that Friday.
[02:41:22.851 --> 02:41:25.652]  So he's flying in Saturday morning, but he'll be speaking Sunday.
[02:41:26.593 --> 02:41:32.655]  We have got Professor Fetzer, the founder and head of the 9-11 Scholars for Truth.
[02:41:33.156 --> 02:41:33.696]  He'll be there.
[02:41:34.076 --> 02:41:35.176]  Stephen Jones is tentative.
[02:41:37.521 --> 02:41:39.943]  We're going to have Webster Tarpley of 9-11 Synthetic Terror made in the USA.
[02:41:53.161 --> 02:41:54.782]  There's a whole bunch of people that want to come.
[02:41:55.522 --> 02:41:57.622]  I'm not going to name them, because I don't even know who we can have.
[02:41:57.662 --> 02:42:05.024]  We can't have too many, because I want to give each person an hour, an hour and a half, so they have plenty of time to go through their presentations.
[02:42:05.864 --> 02:42:09.565]  But we've listed who's going to be there currently on the event roster.
[02:42:09.585 --> 02:42:10.865]  We'll have roundtable discussions.
[02:42:11.945 --> 02:42:14.146]  In fact, the more I think about it, we may have started at, say, 11 a.m.
[02:42:14.166 --> 02:42:14.506]  or 10 a.m.
[02:42:15.706 --> 02:42:20.049]  With a little introduction and then a film just so we have time to get them all in.
[02:42:20.069 --> 02:42:22.391]  We may even start earlier than 12 noon, but right now it's 12 noon.
[02:42:22.991 --> 02:42:33.979]  If you live anywhere on the west coast or anywhere in the country where you want to kill two birds with one stone, I know a lot of people that I know personally who are coming are going to visit family who live in Southern California while they're at this event.
[02:42:33.999 --> 02:42:40.184]  So you fly in Thursday, fly in Friday, go to the Saturday and Sunday event and then go visit family or friends or folks you haven't seen in a while.
[02:42:40.999 --> 02:42:44.781]  For part of that week, it's kind of in the vacation season, which is good.
[02:42:45.261 --> 02:42:52.145]  You can hang out in Southern California and take in any of the sights that you'd like to go look at.
[02:42:52.525 --> 02:42:53.546]  Hearst Castle, whatever.
[02:42:53.566 --> 02:42:59.208]  I hope you don't want to go to Universal Studios and waste your time there or go to Disneyland, but whatever.
[02:43:00.009 --> 02:43:01.630]  It's a great place for a conference.
[02:43:03.010 --> 02:43:05.932]  You know, when I have a movie showing, I charge six, eight bucks, whatever.
[02:43:06.993 --> 02:43:07.694]  It's not a money thing.
[02:43:07.734 --> 02:43:08.795]  This is very expensive.
[02:43:09.255 --> 02:43:12.178]  So that's why we're charging 70-something dollars a ticket.
[02:43:12.198 --> 02:43:13.780]  But if you get five or more, what is it?
[02:43:14.961 --> 02:43:17.743]  If you get five or more, it is going to be $34.50.
[02:43:18.264 --> 02:43:21.566]  So you can take the whole family or you and the neighbor and get together.
[02:43:21.586 --> 02:43:23.328]  You know, husband and wife.
[02:43:23.348 --> 02:43:25.030]  You get to go with the neighbor or husband and wife.
[02:43:25.410 --> 02:43:26.131]  And they can go.
[02:43:26.191 --> 02:43:27.592]  Or mom and dad.
[02:43:27.652 --> 02:43:28.933]  And take the two kids.
[02:43:28.953 --> 02:43:30.875]  And maybe take your, take grandma.
[02:43:31.670 --> 02:43:39.772]  It's going to be a wonderful event and then we're going to shoot video of it from all angles and churn out a documentary.
[02:43:40.232 --> 02:43:46.993]  I know it's hard to rush things but I'm really going to target to have it out three months after the event.
[02:43:49.493 --> 02:43:51.034]  Because time is of the essence.
[02:43:52.214 --> 02:43:57.655]  You know, people ask why I don't glove trot like so many other quote patriots and truth tellers.
[02:43:58.621 --> 02:44:13.454]  Because I can sit here in my studio making films seen by millions on the internet for free, as we put them out for free, and seen by hundreds of thousands on DVD when people are done making copies, and I can do radio interviews every day and reach millions, and do my own show and reach millions, and just really have a bigger effect.
[02:44:13.594 --> 02:44:20.760]  But an event like this is great because the mainstream media will come, they will see all this documentation, it will be very hard for them to spin it.
[02:44:21.361 --> 02:44:22.822]  Alternative media can be there.
[02:44:23.342 --> 02:44:25.184]  We are allowing cameras under media, but
[02:44:26.634 --> 02:44:31.877]  There's troublemakers and people we know are operatives who are not going to be welcome.
[02:44:33.498 --> 02:44:35.159]  There's very few, but we know who they are.
[02:44:35.259 --> 02:44:39.382]  And so, if you want to be media, want to be there, you have to submit that through the email to us.
[02:44:39.462 --> 02:44:41.723]  It's on the event site.
[02:44:41.803 --> 02:44:49.568]  And then, obviously, I will reserve the right to not let you videotape if I don't like you, basically.
[02:44:51.229 --> 02:44:54.271]  Because we're not going to have our event toyed with.
[02:44:55.646 --> 02:44:57.247]  So, please come to it.
[02:44:57.748 --> 02:44:58.829]  It's going to be wonderful.
[02:44:58.909 --> 02:45:00.750]  It's going to be a one-time event.
[02:45:00.770 --> 02:45:03.192]  I'm not going to do any more of these, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:45:03.793 --> 02:45:04.393]  This is it.
[02:45:05.474 --> 02:45:06.095]  And we're going in.
[02:45:06.115 --> 02:45:07.316]  We're going in full throttle.
[02:45:08.336 --> 02:45:09.657]  So, I want to see you out there.
[02:45:09.697 --> 02:45:14.101]  Go to infowars.com to secure your tickets right now.
[02:45:15.462 --> 02:45:17.003]  Or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[02:45:23.234 --> 02:45:25.295]  That's 888-253-3139.
[02:45:26.917 --> 02:45:31.740]  Now, you can also write to us if you want to.
[02:45:32.680 --> 02:45:49.612]  We'll mail you your ticket, but we're going to cut that off about two and a half weeks or so, because you send a snail mail, it might take seven or eight days to get here, then we send it back to you, four or five days to get to you, the postman doesn't, you know, I'm going to allow mail if that's what you want to do, but I'd say by the first week of June,
[02:45:50.487 --> 02:46:00.552]  We're going to cut off people writing in letters, but if that's how you prefer to do it, you can just simply send us $74 for one ticket.
[02:46:01.372 --> 02:46:03.013]  Two tickets, $62 a piece.
[02:46:03.033 --> 02:46:04.654]  Three or four tickets, $54.66 each.
[02:46:04.934 --> 02:46:07.856]  I don't know why they chose that number.
[02:46:08.876 --> 02:46:09.116]  I said $54.
[02:46:09.196 --> 02:46:10.097]  It doesn't matter.
[02:46:10.937 --> 02:46:11.958]  I guess they did an average.
[02:46:11.978 --> 02:46:13.298]  They were trying to average out the tickets.
[02:46:13.638 --> 02:46:14.639]  Five or more tickets, $34.50 each.
[02:46:18.032 --> 02:46:20.373]  And believe me, we're getting the best projectors, screens.
[02:46:20.653 --> 02:46:24.354]  You ought to see how much it costs to rent a big ballroom that holds 1,200 people.
[02:46:24.874 --> 02:46:29.216]  That's what it holds, but we're going to have a big stage and a media riser, so it's really a little over $1,000 that it will hold.
[02:46:29.776 --> 02:46:35.398]  It's really nice, and again, you can stay wherever you want, but you get a big discount on a nice four-star hotel.
[02:46:36.258 --> 02:46:38.779]  It's normally like, in L.A., like $200 a night.
[02:46:38.899 --> 02:46:40.119]  I think it's $126 a night.
[02:46:40.259 --> 02:46:46.101]  If you don't want to do that, there's stuff down to $50 a night in the surrounding area.
[02:46:48.434 --> 02:46:49.395]  It's going to be exciting.
[02:46:49.495 --> 02:46:50.496]  It's going to be a lot of fun.
[02:46:50.516 --> 02:46:51.856]  I've got to fly all these people out there.
[02:46:52.557 --> 02:46:55.419]  And we've got to pay for their rooms.
[02:46:55.479 --> 02:46:57.500]  It's also good that you folks go ahead and buy your tickets.
[02:46:57.540 --> 02:47:00.602]  That will help fund and run the whole thing.
[02:47:00.622 --> 02:47:03.224]  But luckily we've got the funds to pay for it outright if we need to.
[02:47:03.244 --> 02:47:05.065]  But it would be nice to break even on this.
[02:47:06.348 --> 02:47:23.197]  In fact, we're charging with the tickets, if you want to know what this thing is costing us, we're charging with the tickets when they average out to about $45 a piece, depending on the deals we offer, we're charging on the tickets what it's going to cost just to break even with the spread we've done, what we've looked at with the old calculator.
[02:47:24.157 --> 02:47:28.059]  So again, InfoWars.com to order right now.
[02:47:28.079 --> 02:47:31.421]  It's a secure online, safe ticketing, mainstream service that we have links to.
[02:47:32.276 --> 02:47:48.539]  Now, or you can simply call toll-free 1-888-253-3139 or write to me, I'm Alex Jones at 3001 South Lamar Suite 100, Austin, Texas 78704.
[02:47:48.979 --> 02:47:57.661]  And it'd be really nice if all the other shows on Genesis and even some of the other networks out there that I have their people on routinely
[02:47:58.354 --> 02:48:11.224]  It'd be nice if they would get behind this and promote this, and it'd be nice if you'd call into all the shows for us listeners, I don't ask this a lot, and tell people to go to InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com and secure their tickets and come out to the event.
[02:48:13.065 --> 02:48:19.530]  And we're going to have lengthy questions and answers for at least 20-30 minutes after each speaker, so you can have questions, and if your questions are good,
[02:48:20.330 --> 02:48:23.571]  We'll include those in the film, so you'll end up being in a historical film.
[02:48:23.591 --> 02:48:28.313]  And that's what this is really all about, is getting together and having great speakers and making the mainstream media face the facts.
[02:48:29.473 --> 02:48:31.094]  It's two days of 9-11 Truth.
[02:48:31.494 --> 02:48:32.334]  Face the facts.
[02:48:33.735 --> 02:48:34.675]  Facing the facts.
[02:48:35.395 --> 02:48:36.716]  We want to see you there.
[02:48:36.736 --> 02:48:40.277]  We'll come back, cover some final news, and wrap up this transmission.
[02:48:40.977 --> 02:48:41.738]  I'll see you June 24th, 25th.
[02:48:45.788 --> 02:48:47.308]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:48:47.488 --> 02:48:50.589]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[02:48:50.709 --> 02:48:54.610]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[02:48:54.670 --> 02:48:58.891]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[02:48:59.231 --> 02:49:03.012]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[02:49:03.152 --> 02:49:05.053]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[02:49:05.153 --> 02:49:08.474]  Why have police attacked people on the street indiscriminately?
[02:49:08.494 --> 02:49:09.574]  The medical bills!
[02:49:11.195 --> 02:49:13.236]  Are going to be enormous for me.
[02:49:13.376 --> 02:49:16.418]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[02:49:16.598 --> 02:49:19.499]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[02:49:19.939 --> 02:49:26.063]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[02:49:26.583 --> 02:49:30.385]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.
[02:49:30.785 --> 02:49:32.166]  Order your video today.
[02:49:32.566 --> 02:49:33.547]  Call toll free at 888-253-3139.

[02:49:50.756 --> 02:49:56.218]  Ideal for sporting games, camping or boating, or Sport Berkey is small enough to store in your glove box.
[02:49:56.238 --> 02:50:00.540]  So it's ideal backup for unexpected emergencies like blackouts, floods or earthquakes.
[02:50:00.881 --> 02:50:03.902]  It's simply the best personal water filtration system available.
[02:50:04.202 --> 02:50:07.644]  So effective you can drink raw, untreated water from lakes, rivers and streams.
[02:50:07.964 --> 02:50:17.332]  Unlike other sport bottles, the Sport Berkey's patented filter formulation is so powerful it removes cysts, parasites, harmful bacteria, and chemicals like herbicides and pesticides.
[02:50:17.572 --> 02:50:21.075]  It even reduces radon-222, lead, and other heavy metals.
[02:50:21.315 --> 02:50:28.421]  This lightweight, rugged 22-ounce filter is small enough to go everywhere, so take one to work and keep another in your glove box for emergencies.
[02:50:28.681 --> 02:50:30.042]  Get the Berkey Sport for only $39.00.

[02:50:46.394 --> 02:50:46.735]  I think so.
[02:51:01.616 --> 02:51:02.276]  We're good to go!
[02:51:31.152 --> 02:51:34.234]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[02:51:34.394 --> 02:51:40.358]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective, natural alternatives and education.
[02:51:52.265 --> 02:51:57.968]  We got Colonel Craig Robertson who worked the murder case of Oklahoma City Police Department
[02:51:58.758 --> 02:52:02.461]  Sergeant Terrence Yakey, who was murdered, clearly, by the Feds.
[02:52:02.822 --> 02:52:04.243]  He was exposing government involvement.
[02:52:04.263 --> 02:52:08.006]  He was Police Officer of the Year and rushed in the building and witnessed everything that happened.
[02:52:08.026 --> 02:52:09.487]  The BATF, the bombs, all of it.
[02:52:10.428 --> 02:52:14.251]  And there's a remembrance and a rally to expose what's happening out front.
[02:52:14.291 --> 02:52:17.734]  The Oklahoma City Police Department coming up on Monday.
[02:52:17.774 --> 02:52:21.076]  And one of the folks that's been organizing this is Chris Emery doing a great job.
[02:52:21.477 --> 02:52:24.960]  Chris, tell us about this event and why folks should come out to it.
[02:52:25.240 --> 02:52:26.401]  Here in a minute or two, we've got left.
[02:52:27.341 --> 02:52:31.845]  Well, it's going to be a press conference for the family.
[02:52:32.305 --> 02:52:35.628]  The family members have been wanting to get the truth out on this case for the past 10 years.
[02:52:36.248 --> 02:52:40.872]  And I've gotten to know them over the last two and a half, three years, putting together a film document around the bombing.
[02:52:41.653 --> 02:52:45.416]  And here it is, 10 years, May 8th, marks 10 years of the day that he was killed.
[02:52:45.916 --> 02:52:53.603]  And we want to commemorate the memory of what Terry did with the police department for seven years to put his life on the line every single day that he showed up for work.
[02:52:54.309 --> 02:52:59.510]  And this is the least we could do is continue to ask for the truth about what really happened regarding his death.
[02:53:00.310 --> 02:53:01.210]  Well, we know the truth.
[02:53:01.230 --> 02:53:02.251]  They just won't do anything about it.
[02:53:02.271 --> 02:53:04.031]  I didn't know you'd made a film when you're done with it.
[02:53:04.071 --> 02:53:04.631]  Send me a copy.
[02:53:04.651 --> 02:53:05.311]  Maybe I'll carry it.
[02:53:06.231 --> 02:53:06.771]  I would love to.
[02:53:06.831 --> 02:53:12.072]  We're not even close to post-production, but we'll definitely keep you posted.
[02:53:12.092 --> 02:53:14.393]  Tell us the time and place so people can come.
[02:53:14.973 --> 02:53:15.933]  It'll be between 1.30 p.m.
[02:53:16.053 --> 02:53:16.833]  and 2.30 p.m.
[02:53:16.853 --> 02:53:19.774]  this coming Monday, May 8th, in front of the
[02:53:20.330 --> 02:53:25.111]  Actually, right across the street from the Oklahoma City Police Department Headquarters at 701 Cole Court.
[02:53:25.191 --> 02:53:28.152]  It's just west of downtown Oklahoma City.
[02:53:28.192 --> 02:53:35.193]  Okay, 1.30 to 2.30 and I want to get you on for longer next week and maybe get Charles Key on to talk about what happens at the event.
[02:53:35.453 --> 02:53:36.673]  I appreciate what you're doing, sir.
[02:53:36.713 --> 02:53:37.133]  God bless.
[02:53:37.633 --> 02:53:39.374]  Thank you so much and appreciate your help, Alex.
[02:53:39.394 --> 02:53:39.854]  Have a good day.
[02:53:40.034 --> 02:53:40.414]  You bet.
[02:53:40.454 --> 02:53:41.034]  Take care.
[02:53:41.214 --> 02:53:45.795]  We've got the flyer on that and links to it up on InfoWars.com right now.
[02:53:47.731 --> 02:53:55.117]  That's what we do on this broadcast, is try to support everybody, try to get the word out, try to support these movements and what people are doing, and it's very, very important.
[02:53:56.898 --> 02:53:59.180]  There's a lot of serious news I didn't have time to get to.
[02:53:59.540 --> 02:54:07.567]  The Colombian President has confirmed, this is Fox News and AP both, to say that they want to put microchips in all their immigrants to the U.S.
[02:54:07.587 --> 02:54:11.189]  I mean, the Mexican Attorney General has made his employees take it.
[02:54:11.249 --> 02:54:13.031]  I mean, stuff's getting really, really weird.
[02:54:13.666 --> 02:54:17.288]  There's a bunch of other scary news about secret police spies all over the U.S.
[02:54:17.769 --> 02:54:19.370]  That's in the mainstream news.
[02:54:19.950 --> 02:54:23.472]  A lot of stuff on PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com that you don't want to miss.
[02:54:25.654 --> 02:54:27.215]  What I'll do is, I didn't get to a lot of the news today.
[02:54:27.235 --> 02:54:27.935]  I covered some of it.
[02:54:28.355 --> 02:54:32.758]  I'll just leave this in my stack until Monday and cover all the new news on Monday and try to get through this on Monday.
[02:54:33.239 --> 02:54:35.320]  We had three great guests today so we ran out of time.
[02:54:36.801 --> 02:54:39.523]  And I really haven't yet plugged the films yet today.
[02:54:40.103 --> 02:54:40.964]  That's what funds us.
[02:54:41.004 --> 02:54:41.965]  That's what helps us operate.
[02:54:41.985 --> 02:54:43.206]  Plus, they're excellent documentaries.
[02:54:43.566 --> 02:54:44.747]  Get my film, Martial Law.
[02:54:44.767 --> 02:54:46.008]  9-11, Rise of the Police State.
[02:54:46.028 --> 02:54:46.868]  Get Road to Tyranny.
[02:54:47.289 --> 02:54:48.870]  Get Loose Change 2, 2nd Edition.
[02:54:48.970 --> 02:54:50.211]  Or Loose Change, 2nd Edition.
[02:54:50.251 --> 02:54:51.552]  Not Loose Change 2, 2nd Edition.
[02:54:52.192 --> 02:54:53.193]  I'd be squared, I guess.
[02:54:54.114 --> 02:54:55.775]  It's such an important film to get.
[02:54:55.835 --> 02:54:57.156]  Get my new film, The Order of Death.
[02:54:57.476 --> 02:55:05.502]  Go to Infowars.com while you're getting your tickets to the big 9-11 Truth Movement meeting we're going to have in Los Angeles at the Sheraton.
[02:55:06.850 --> 02:55:08.971]  The 24th and 25th of next month.
[02:55:09.051 --> 02:55:09.831]  That's June.
[02:55:10.511 --> 02:55:12.791]  While you're busy doing that, be sure and get Road to Tyranny.
[02:55:12.831 --> 02:55:24.194]  Get the different films I've produced, the books I've written, the books I carry, the books I've published, the other books and documentaries that we have there on the Secure Online Safe Shopping Card on the video and bookstore page.
[02:55:24.314 --> 02:55:25.735]  That's InfoWars.com.
[02:55:26.075 --> 02:55:27.915]  Or again, the same number to call and get the videos.
[02:55:27.975 --> 02:55:31.356]  If you'd like to order that way, it's the same number to call and get a ticket.
[02:55:32.036 --> 02:55:34.979]  Uh, emailed or mailed to you physically is 1-888-253-3139.
[02:55:35.219 --> 02:55:43.946]  This is taking a lot of organizing, but it's going to be a beautiful event.
[02:55:44.407 --> 02:55:46.449]  We've got it all set up, so please come out.
[02:55:46.969 --> 02:55:48.851]  And if you can't do that, please get Road to Tyranny.
[02:55:48.891 --> 02:55:49.771]  Please get Martial Law.
[02:55:49.811 --> 02:55:50.832]  Please make copies of them.
