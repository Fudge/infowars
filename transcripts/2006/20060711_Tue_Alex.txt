[00:00:05.612 --> 00:00:06.253]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.913 --> 00:00:07.955]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.675 --> 00:00:09.776]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.437 --> 00:00:11.258]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:12.920]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:17.304]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.764 --> 00:00:21.849]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:24.975 --> 00:00:25.996]  Welcome, my friends.
[00:00:26.076 --> 00:00:28.920]  It is Tuesday, the 11th day of July, 2006.
[00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:34.707]  We're going to be live here for the next three hours.
[00:00:34.807 --> 00:00:42.456]  Coming up at the bottom of the next hour, the second hour, Richard Linklater, the award-winning movie director.
[00:00:43.414 --> 00:00:56.891]  We'll be joining us to talk about his new film, A Scanner Darkly, that opened in select theaters to incredible reviews by the critics Friday and will be expanding out the next month nationwide.
[00:00:56.911 --> 00:01:01.657]  It is showing here in Austin, Texas, New York, Chicago, LA, places like that.
[00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:16.484]  So, Richard Linkletter will be joining us to talk about his dystopic near-future police state film, A Scanner Darkly, that deals with problem, reaction, solution, for thirty minutes of the next hour.
[00:01:16.564 --> 00:01:22.086]  In the third hour, we have Jack McClam, police and military, against the New World Order.
[00:01:22.106 --> 00:01:30.388]  For the last month, he's been doing his own program, Monday through Friday, right here on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:01:30.948 --> 00:01:35.290]  And Jack McClam has been fighting the New World Order for what is it, 24, 25 years?
[00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:51.157]  He's an icon, an expert on the Globalist Crime Syndicate, the International Crime Rings, and he'll be joining us to talk about some of the current events that are transpiring here domestically and internationally on this planet.
[00:01:52.816 --> 00:01:55.777]  We are going to have open phones in this first hour.
[00:01:55.917 --> 00:02:13.722]  Any news item, any issue, any question, any comment, you agree with me, you disagree with me, you want to talk about the North Korea situation, what's happening with the economy and the dollar, gas prices, NSA spying, how the midterm elections are shaping up for a big Democratic win.
[00:02:15.177 --> 00:02:18.619]  Whatever you'd like to discuss, it's a huge grab bag of issues.
[00:02:18.639 --> 00:02:18.699]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:02:18.719 --> 00:02:19.039]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:20.800]  We will get you up and on the air.
[00:02:33.217 --> 00:02:34.498]  Here's just some of the news we have.
[00:02:34.538 --> 00:02:39.301]  Satellite photos detect activity at North Korean missile bases reports.
[00:02:39.961 --> 00:02:48.927]  AFP, the French news agency, and it looks like they may follow up their last round of missile testing with even more.
[00:02:48.947 --> 00:02:53.409]  NSA says it's too secret to be sued.
[00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:55.691]  The South of the Baltimore Sun will cover that.
[00:02:56.231 --> 00:02:58.152]  Colorado okays toughest U.S.
[00:02:58.232 --> 00:03:00.594]  immigration bill at the state level yet.
[00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:07.662]  Man indicted in phone jamming case will argue administration approved election scheme.
[00:03:09.243 --> 00:03:15.345]  Mexico's Calderon's brother-in-law wrote the vote counting software and it's already been attacked.
[00:03:15.865 --> 00:03:25.249]  It's already been hacked and this of course concerns what's happening with the stolen election in Mexico.
[00:03:28.098 --> 00:03:31.200]  Tobacco death toll could reach 1 billion this century.
[00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.222]  Major study finds this covered by the CBC.
[00:03:34.262 --> 00:03:35.543]  I've got some comments on that.
[00:03:35.864 --> 00:03:37.725]  Another big report here out of Alternet.
[00:03:38.105 --> 00:03:44.510]  Autism, a hidden epidemic, even exploding in higher numbers than it was just a few years ago.
[00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:47.132]  An article by Paul Craig Roberts.
[00:03:47.712 --> 00:03:48.633]  Whack attack.
[00:03:49.213 --> 00:03:53.136]  Whack North Korea before it can protect itself.
[00:03:54.685 --> 00:04:02.190]  Another report here I want to have a few words on concerning the flag-burning legislation they're trying to pass.
[00:04:02.651 --> 00:04:04.572]  What's really behind that?
[00:04:06.093 --> 00:04:11.097]  But when we get back, I first want to focus in a little bit
[00:04:12.058 --> 00:04:21.664]  on the situation with North Korea and some of the new developments with the American Union that is now one of the hottest issues in the United States.
[00:04:22.164 --> 00:04:37.414]  Finally, after decades of people trying to expose this ongoing public program, it is now broken into the mainstream and I would sincerely hope that callers to this broadcast would bring that subject up and give us your take, your view on it.
[00:04:39.068 --> 00:04:55.643]  What's happened is, individuals now, the twin hottest issue of open borders and immigration, people have now figured out that that is inexorably intertwined as part of the same agenda to bring you the American Union and kill the United States of America.
[00:04:56.323 --> 00:04:57.084]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:04:57.104 --> 00:04:58.826]  The website is PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:04:58.886 --> 00:04:59.346]  Stay with us.
[00:05:01.425 --> 00:05:05.774]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:05:05.954 --> 00:05:10.403]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:05:10.543 --> 00:05:11.746]  There is a chance...
[00:05:12.301 --> 00:05:14.943]  To use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:05:14.963 --> 00:05:17.826]  The New World Order can emerge.
[00:05:18.086 --> 00:05:22.290]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:29.296]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:05:29.436 --> 00:05:31.438]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:05:31.678 --> 00:05:42.206]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:05:42.426 --> 00:05:47.810]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[00:06:01.323 --> 00:06:04.205]  Are terrorist cells or prime terror targets located near you?
[00:06:04.545 --> 00:06:07.426]  Where are military bases and hazardous waste sites located?
[00:06:07.666 --> 00:06:13.850]  How do you find the best area for solar, average rainfall, fish contamination advisories, and major transportation routes?
[00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:21.534]  In the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA, you will find the information you want with over 50 interactive parameters that you control.
[00:06:21.734 --> 00:06:25.816]  Find everything from housing prices and taxes to brewing environmental catastrophes.
[00:06:26.096 --> 00:06:31.619]  Locate billion-dollar disaster-prone areas, the safest cities, ideal solar locations, and much, much more.

[00:07:01.031 --> 00:07:05.453]  Local folklore has recognized its amazing medicinal properties for thousands of years.
[00:07:05.613 --> 00:07:11.295]  But no one knew just how to preserve the nutritional benefits and market the total fruit commercially until Zango that is.
[00:07:11.655 --> 00:07:16.557]  Zango is made from mangosteen, a fruit that grows in the subtropical climates of Southeast Asia.
[00:07:16.817 --> 00:07:21.319]  It contains anthones, the highest concentration of antioxidants found in nature.
[00:07:21.599 --> 00:07:27.905]  Modern science is only just beginning to unlock the many secrets of Xanthos and their far-reaching potential to improve our health.
[00:07:28.185 --> 00:07:29.727]  Xango is revolutionary.
[00:07:29.927 --> 00:07:39.956]  Not only has Xango taken the world by storm as an extremely potent functional health beverage, but Xango has become the most exciting and fastest growing home-based business opportunity ever.
[00:07:40.257 --> 00:07:42.399]  Life is short, and timing is everything.
[00:07:42.739 --> 00:07:44.340]  Unleash the power of Zango today!
[00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:47.121]  Find out more by calling 888-203-6633.
[00:07:48.161 --> 00:07:51.543]  That's 888-203-6633.
[00:07:51.803 --> 00:07:55.264]  Or visit www.MangosteenMarket.com.
[00:07:55.504 --> 00:07:59.526]  That's M-A-N-G-O-S-T-E-E-N-Market.com.
[00:08:01.607 --> 00:08:07.169]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:27.999 --> 00:08:41.344]  When we have a major victory, I think a lot of people in the truth movement, the patriot movement, the libertarian movement, the smaller government movement, the freedom movement, whatever name you want to ascribe to your particular ilk of freedom lover,
[00:08:43.018 --> 00:08:46.001]  We don't really spend enough time on the victories that we've had.
[00:08:46.781 --> 00:08:48.703]  And one of the biggest victories is 9-11.
[00:08:50.044 --> 00:08:53.607]  Half of Americans in scientific polls believe the U.S.
[00:08:53.667 --> 00:08:55.949]  government elements of it carried out the attacks.
[00:08:56.069 --> 00:09:05.598]  Sixty-eight percent, this is in two separate polls, believe that the government is covering up what happened on 9-11 and quote, may have consciously failed to act.
[00:09:07.259 --> 00:09:10.602]  Fifty percent, or if you want to get technical, forty-eight percent
[00:09:11.471 --> 00:09:12.311]  believe that the U.S.
[00:09:12.331 --> 00:09:15.692]  government was behind the attacks.
[00:09:16.793 --> 00:09:25.416]  And we have the former Marine Corps historian, the head historian, the former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense going public and saying it's a cover-up and a lie and a fraud.
[00:09:25.456 --> 00:09:35.759]  We have the head of the largest victims of 9-11, the largest group of victims' families going public saying all the evidence points towards an inside job.
[00:09:36.379 --> 00:09:39.180]  We have stood up in the face of the storm
[00:09:40.715 --> 00:09:54.481]  Many of you since day one and warned people and made copies of DVDs and VHS tapes and posted on blogs and message boards and called into radio talk shows and when you get half the people
[00:09:55.575 --> 00:10:03.462]  And that's in a scientific Zogby poll where they're calling people up at their homes and asking these questions.
[00:10:03.542 --> 00:10:19.695]  I guarantee you it's higher than 50% because a lot of people would be nervous and wouldn't want the NSA that's listening in to know what their true views are or don't want to tell some stranger something that's controversial.
[00:10:21.164 --> 00:10:23.605]  And that's why they've announced the NSA is spying on us.
[00:10:23.625 --> 00:10:25.105]  That's why they've made it so prominent.
[00:10:25.345 --> 00:10:34.248]  It's been verifiable in industry publications and in government documents since 1996 that all this was going on with the NSA.
[00:10:34.268 --> 00:10:43.570]  But see, now they're trying to announce this to kill street corner talk, to kill talk on the bus, or talk around the water cooler, or talk at church.
[00:10:43.990 --> 00:10:46.231]  It is an attempt to intimidate
[00:10:47.296 --> 00:10:52.160]  The American people, the people of the West, the people of the world, and it's not going to work.
[00:10:52.260 --> 00:11:05.429]  So, that is really exciting, and I was thinking about it last night, how blessed we are and how important this is, because 9-11 is the foundational event for this entire New World Order operation that we see unfolding.
[00:11:09.167 --> 00:11:28.828]  And more importantly, if we do not expose 9-11, the New World Order crime syndicate will continue to carry out terror attacks to forward an expansion of their ongoing program of world government and world domination and individual enslavement and micromanagement by the control freak high priest of the New World Order system.
[00:11:31.374 --> 00:11:33.957]  So it is so important that we do this.
[00:11:34.037 --> 00:11:36.620]  They are facing great setbacks at every level.
[00:11:37.021 --> 00:11:45.610]  Worldwide, the neocon current crop of managers that work for the Illuminati are in deep trouble.
[00:11:46.912 --> 00:11:48.293]  It doesn't mean they're out of the fight.
[00:11:48.313 --> 00:11:49.595]  It doesn't mean we've beaten them.
[00:11:50.169 --> 00:11:52.110]  It just shows we've thrown a few good punches.
[00:11:52.531 --> 00:11:55.853]  They're stunned momentarily leaning on the ropes.
[00:11:55.913 --> 00:11:57.414]  They're still bigger than we are.
[00:11:57.834 --> 00:11:59.576]  In many cases they're meaner than we are.
[00:11:59.936 --> 00:12:01.957]  We know they're a lot more ruthless than we are.
[00:12:02.357 --> 00:12:04.239]  And they'll lie, they'll cheat, they'll steal.
[00:12:04.619 --> 00:12:07.981]  So we're not out of the arena yet.
[00:12:08.021 --> 00:12:16.107]  We've got to start pounding as hard as we can like we're losing the fight 110% right until the final bell rings.
[00:12:16.687 --> 00:12:18.909]  We're in sudden death overtime.
[00:12:20.143 --> 00:12:31.108]  And we've got to go nine yards to get the first down here, ladies and gentlemen, and we're on the fourth down right now.
[00:12:32.129 --> 00:12:35.170]  And we can't punt, we can't kick, that's not a guarantee.
[00:12:35.210 --> 00:12:38.952]  We've got to run the ball into the end zone.
[00:12:39.032 --> 00:12:40.173]  It's got to happen.
[00:12:41.044 --> 00:12:43.445]  We've got a chance to win this thing!
[00:12:44.006 --> 00:12:48.428]  And the COINTELPRO operatives are coming out of the woodwork trying to distract, trying to divert.
[00:12:48.468 --> 00:12:50.009]  They're pulling their hair out angry.
[00:12:50.269 --> 00:12:51.450]  They're exposing themselves.
[00:12:51.470 --> 00:12:52.850]  They're looking even more ridiculous.
[00:12:53.111 --> 00:12:54.571]  That's blowing up in their faces.
[00:12:55.012 --> 00:12:59.274]  Again, we're having victory after victory after victory after victory right now.
[00:13:02.344 --> 00:13:05.908]  And we've got to first off, as I've always said, believe that we can win.
[00:13:06.008 --> 00:13:07.530]  Believe that we can tell the truth.
[00:13:07.590 --> 00:13:11.594]  Believe that we can stand up and expose the evil and stand against the darkness.
[00:13:12.955 --> 00:13:24.027]  Another piece of wonderful news, and I'm going to your calls, and that is that Glenn Beck last night on CNN, who is a horrible little neocon, very deceptive, but he knows where the ratings are.
[00:13:24.733 --> 00:13:25.954]  He knows where his listeners are.
[00:13:25.994 --> 00:13:27.014]  He knows where the people are.
[00:13:27.054 --> 00:13:28.836]  He knows where their passion is.
[00:13:29.116 --> 00:13:40.022]  He's being forced to come out and say, gee, I hate conspiracy theories, but I tell you, when one is admitted and documented, you've got to cover it, and America's dying, we're going into an American Union.
[00:13:41.143 --> 00:13:43.305]  He's doing it because he's a sniveling creature for ratings.
[00:13:43.725 --> 00:13:44.445]  Not Lou Dobbs.
[00:13:44.485 --> 00:13:45.226]  You can really tell.
[00:13:45.286 --> 00:13:46.206]  I've watched him for years.
[00:13:46.526 --> 00:13:48.027]  He's getting away with what he can.
[00:13:48.368 --> 00:13:49.348]  He's not an elitist.
[00:13:49.628 --> 00:13:50.909]  His heart is in the right place.
[00:13:51.029 --> 00:13:51.990]  And, of course, he's getting the ratings.
[00:13:53.189 --> 00:13:54.590]  Because we have the majority view!
[00:13:54.790 --> 00:13:56.251]  Who's for America disappearing?
[00:13:56.451 --> 00:13:58.653]  Who's for America merging with Mexico and Canada?
[00:13:58.873 --> 00:14:00.654]  Who is for losing our sovereignty?
[00:14:00.874 --> 00:14:05.197]  Who is for having the roads turned into huge toll roads, paid into international bodies?
[00:14:05.977 --> 00:14:06.498]  No one!
[00:14:06.798 --> 00:14:07.598]  No one!
[00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:13.262]  You want to get precise, technical, specific?
[00:14:14.233 --> 00:14:23.540]  Major polls in this state, 97% against the transponder tolls, and that's with people not even knowing 5% of the full story of what the American Union means.
[00:14:27.623 --> 00:14:37.051]  And so, now we have all of these different mainstream publications and TV shows going, well, we can't deny it, it's true, American Union.
[00:14:37.631 --> 00:14:38.792]  Congress didn't debate it.
[00:14:41.194 --> 00:14:43.896]  No one had a chance to vote on it.
[00:14:45.603 --> 00:14:48.964]  The Bilderberg Group, of course, set up in 1954 in Germany.
[00:14:51.205 --> 00:15:02.950]  They've released, I guess, a brag about their crimes, some of their first 54 document minutes, and they say that, oh, we're going to set up an EU, this is how we're going to do it, we're going to call it a trade deal, that's even in the BBC.
[00:15:03.250 --> 00:15:05.591]  Just type Bilderberg Group in, in one of the first links on
[00:15:06.566 --> 00:15:16.356]  On Google Web Search, one of the first links is a group of BBC articles where, again, it's the Bilderberg Group bragging.
[00:15:16.736 --> 00:15:23.222]  These creatures are now bragging about how they killed Europe, they're trying to kill Britain, and how they're going to kill America.
[00:15:23.242 --> 00:15:25.084]  How they're going to kill the United States.
[00:15:25.485 --> 00:15:27.066]  They were up in Canada just a month ago now.
[00:15:29.722 --> 00:15:32.524]  Seems like a hundred years ago, so much has happened in the last month.
[00:15:32.804 --> 00:15:34.646]  And we got the same intel out of there again.
[00:15:34.686 --> 00:15:35.506]  They're hopping mad.
[00:15:35.526 --> 00:15:37.548]  They're trying to create their American Union.
[00:15:37.888 --> 00:15:39.910]  Bush hands it over to Homeland Security.
[00:15:40.710 --> 00:15:46.975]  Chertoff is the person that sits at the head of the board over this prosperity partnership.
[00:15:48.376 --> 00:15:50.978]  They've got three members from each country sitting on it.
[00:15:51.863 --> 00:15:58.775]  We've had joint congresses with Mexico now going back five years as they set this up with Canada attending as well.
[00:15:59.316 --> 00:16:04.264]  And they're simply directing the federal agencies to merge the countries right now!
[00:16:05.126 --> 00:16:09.288]  As Lou Dobbs said, this isn't coming, this is happening right now.
[00:16:09.348 --> 00:16:09.988]  You understand?
[00:16:10.009 --> 00:16:12.970]  The doors are closing on freedom.
[00:16:13.290 --> 00:16:23.875]  The knife is being drawn across the arteries, the carotid arteries, the jugular, in the throat.
[00:16:24.756 --> 00:16:27.217]  The blood is spewing and spurting.
[00:16:27.537 --> 00:16:29.178]  Half the throat is already slit.
[00:16:29.438 --> 00:16:30.699]  If America gets instant
[00:16:31.431 --> 00:16:36.854]  Emergency care, and we can pull back from this now, this country may survive.
[00:16:37.755 --> 00:16:38.895]  May survive.
[00:16:38.955 --> 00:16:43.778]  Blood is literally spurting in black gouts out of her throat.
[00:16:44.298 --> 00:16:49.281]  The New World Order is snickering and gibbering and giggling right now.
[00:16:50.842 --> 00:16:51.602]  They love it.
[00:16:52.342 --> 00:16:54.644]  They love destroying this country.
[00:16:55.064 --> 00:16:56.285]  It was such a thorn in their side.
[00:16:56.305 --> 00:16:56.945]  I remember reading
[00:16:58.067 --> 00:17:01.510]  National Banking Association documents from what, 108 years ago?
[00:17:01.530 --> 00:17:15.382]  I remember reading public editorials in the Times of London that if those Americans are allowed to issue their own credit and not be under the European Central Banking System it will spread as a revolution and our empire will be destroyed!
[00:17:16.963 --> 00:17:21.947]  They've been hating this country for 230 years!
[00:17:22.968 --> 00:17:25.150]  They've been scared of it and now they've seized it?
[00:17:25.856 --> 00:17:37.701]  They've seized the high ground in our government, the legislative, the executive, the judicial, and they're busy basically throwing down stumbling blocks off of their parapets against us as we attempt to take the country back.
[00:17:38.602 --> 00:17:43.224]  And they're busy shouting their propaganda to all the peasants, Oh, don't join the rebels!
[00:17:43.284 --> 00:17:44.044]  They're evil!
[00:17:44.104 --> 00:17:45.525]  They're crazy!
[00:17:45.585 --> 00:17:46.625]  Don't join them!
[00:17:46.905 --> 00:17:49.746]  But the people are starting to go, Wait a minute, you're the enemy government!
[00:17:50.007 --> 00:17:51.427]  Wait a minute, you're usurpers!
[00:17:51.487 --> 00:17:51.947]  Wait a minute!
[00:17:53.908 --> 00:17:55.269]  America's been sold out!
[00:17:57.463 --> 00:17:59.184]  You know who owns and controls this country?
[00:17:59.224 --> 00:18:01.025]  You can get these official financial numbers.
[00:18:02.146 --> 00:18:23.701]  British elites, aristocracy, royalty, large German interest, large British interest, large Zionist interest, large European interest, come to this country and they stick coins in it like it's a vending machine and they pull the lever and what they want out of the vending machine pops out.
[00:18:24.601 --> 00:18:25.722]  Pops out at the bottom.
[00:18:27.722 --> 00:18:28.463]  And it's a joke.
[00:18:28.503 --> 00:18:29.904]  They come in and buy your politicians.
[00:18:29.944 --> 00:18:30.925]  They hand them the railways.
[00:18:31.225 --> 00:18:32.106]  Here, private company.
[00:18:32.306 --> 00:18:33.067]  Here, pay no money.
[00:18:33.107 --> 00:18:34.588]  We'll pay you to take over the roads.
[00:18:34.628 --> 00:18:35.189]  Here, they're yours.
[00:18:35.709 --> 00:18:41.855]  Tax them $3.80-something per equivalent gallon of gas.
[00:18:42.595 --> 00:18:45.238]  Oh, here, you want drug companies, foreign owned?
[00:18:45.278 --> 00:18:47.800]  You want to have an incentive to drug half the children?
[00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:49.121]  Here, we'll just pass a federal law.
[00:18:49.701 --> 00:18:50.142]  New freedom.
[00:18:51.135 --> 00:18:55.777]  Oh, you want a national ID card to track and trace every purchase and everything we do and all of our movements?
[00:18:56.177 --> 00:18:59.358]  Here, we'll just pass it and implement it and won't even tell the American people.
[00:18:59.638 --> 00:19:03.760]  Over in England, the national ID card has failed eight times now in the last five years.
[00:19:04.140 --> 00:19:05.060]  But over there, they're honest.
[00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:07.301]  They say it's a national ID card.
[00:19:07.501 --> 00:19:08.382]  Here, they don't call it that.
[00:19:08.402 --> 00:19:09.182]  They don't even tell you.
[00:19:09.202 --> 00:19:12.363]  They just pass the legislation and then they implement it at the state level.
[00:19:13.784 --> 00:19:17.365]  But the good news is now the
[00:19:18.308 --> 00:19:20.650]  The cracks in the facade started years ago.
[00:19:20.970 --> 00:19:23.952]  Now there's huge holes in this iron curtain of lies.
[00:19:24.372 --> 00:19:26.393]  The sunlight is streaming in.
[00:19:26.413 --> 00:19:30.276]  The public are squinting and squeezing their eyes.
[00:19:30.296 --> 00:19:30.976]  They're blinded.
[00:19:31.216 --> 00:19:32.557]  But they're starting to come out of their haze.
[00:19:32.577 --> 00:19:34.258]  They're starting to acclimatize to the light.
[00:19:34.498 --> 00:19:35.579]  They're starting to look around them.
[00:19:35.599 --> 00:19:37.921]  They're starting to go, what in the world is going on here?
[00:19:39.682 --> 00:19:42.043]  And it's blowing up in the New World Order's face.
[00:19:42.844 --> 00:19:44.185]  All over the Western world.
[00:19:45.125 --> 00:19:45.966]  From Australia.
[00:19:47.034 --> 00:19:49.555]  To Canada, the United States, to England, to Germany.
[00:19:49.795 --> 00:19:51.135]  They're throwing out the EU.
[00:19:51.155 --> 00:19:53.416]  They're throwing out American Union and Latin America.
[00:19:54.216 --> 00:19:58.077]  We'll come back, talk to Chris in Australia and others.
[00:19:58.117 --> 00:19:58.537]  Stay with us.
[00:20:01.538 --> 00:20:05.579]  People who use Cardivite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[00:20:05.799 --> 00:20:09.200]  For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself time-tested.
[00:20:09.380 --> 00:20:12.781]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite.
[00:20:13.109 --> 00:20:16.372]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[00:20:16.392 --> 00:20:21.856]  This basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the disease that we've seen.
[00:20:21.896 --> 00:20:31.523]  When we do our program, you know, in herpal formulas like cardivite and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill now going for regular jog a few months later, we know we're doing something right.
[00:20:31.664 --> 00:20:33.005]  It's a well thought out formula.
[00:20:33.025 --> 00:20:38.429]  I mean, the idea of it working on yeast and metals both at the same time and liver function instead on
[00:20:38.832 --> 00:20:43.375]  If you'll find I think that it'll work more than just on heart problems and circulation problems.
[00:20:43.455 --> 00:20:44.816]  It'll work on other problems as well.
[00:20:44.977 --> 00:20:48.859]  For more information call 1-877-928-8822 or visit our website at www.heartdrop.com.
[00:20:48.899 --> 00:20:49.740]  That toll free number again 1-877-928-8822.
[00:21:06.997 --> 00:21:08.219]  Currency devaluation.
[00:21:08.539 --> 00:21:09.100]  Inflation.
[00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:10.281]  One and the same.
[00:21:11.002 --> 00:21:14.986]  If you had deposited $100,000 in a bank at 1% in a 30-month period dating from May 24, 2005, here is what happened to your funds.
[00:21:21.249 --> 00:21:24.371]  The dollar lost 33% of its value in that time frame.
[00:21:24.631 --> 00:21:26.051]  The bank paid you 1%.
[00:21:26.312 --> 00:21:29.553]  Your $100,000 now has a net purchasing power of $68,000.
[00:21:30.094 --> 00:21:32.315]  Here is reality.
[00:21:32.675 --> 00:21:36.257]  The devaluation of currency equals real inflation.
[00:21:36.757 --> 00:21:40.419]  Keep in mind how the value of your paper assets are measured in dollars.
[00:21:40.979 --> 00:21:43.800]  Gold in the same time frame increased 35% in value.
[00:21:45.137 --> 00:21:48.862]  Learn how to protect and profit in this truly unstable world economy.

[00:22:01.184 --> 00:22:04.666]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[00:22:04.946 --> 00:22:08.448]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.

[00:22:12.710 --> 00:22:18.853]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:22:19.254 --> 00:22:27.178]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[00:22:27.578 --> 00:22:32.921]  Black Berkey Filter Elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury and aluminum.
[00:22:33.081 --> 00:22:36.843]  Yet the Black Berkey Filter Elements leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:22:37.203 --> 00:22:39.064]  And the Black Berkey Filters are recleanable.
[00:22:39.124 --> 00:22:41.306]  Simply brush them up with Scotch-Brite pads.
[00:22:41.546 --> 00:22:46.128]  Normally $48 each, you get a 2-pack for only $91 or a 4-pack for only $173.

[00:24:13.035 --> 00:24:16.679]  Chris in Australia, thank you for holding and calling.
[00:24:17.099 --> 00:24:18.421]  You're on the air my friend.
[00:24:19.702 --> 00:24:20.723]  Hi Alex, how are you going?
[00:24:21.303 --> 00:24:23.666]  Good sir, where are you calling us from in Australia?
[00:24:23.686 --> 00:24:25.327]  I'm in Melbourne.
[00:24:26.048 --> 00:24:27.189]  Well welcome, what's on your mind?
[00:24:28.466 --> 00:24:32.969]  Well, first of all, I'd like to say I'd like to thank you for everything that you do.
[00:24:33.149 --> 00:24:47.319]  I've been following this whole movement probably now for about six months after 9-11 in Plain Sight was played on major television and I've now seen four of your movies several times over.
[00:24:47.339 --> 00:24:54.444]  I actually just finished watching Bohemian Grove about half an hour ago and I must say I'm a big fan of what you do.
[00:24:54.944 --> 00:24:57.866]  In Plain Sight was played on Australian television?
[00:24:58.450 --> 00:25:02.872]  Yeah, Channel 10 in Australia, probably about four, about five, six months ago.
[00:25:04.033 --> 00:25:05.034]  Wow, that's incredible.
[00:25:05.974 --> 00:25:12.598]  Yeah, and since then, like, there's been absolutely nothing, you know, absolutely nothing since then.
[00:25:12.698 --> 00:25:18.961]  And my first question is, are you aware of any, you know, large, you know, truth movements in Australia?
[00:25:20.413 --> 00:25:22.854]  There are a lot of people awake to what's happening in Australia.
[00:25:22.894 --> 00:25:25.794]  You can just do a web search on it and find a lot of like-minded people.
[00:25:25.834 --> 00:25:28.235]  In a big city like Melbourne, you can probably find quite a few groups.
[00:25:28.995 --> 00:25:31.096]  Or, if you don't find one, start your own.
[00:25:31.916 --> 00:25:34.456]  Yeah, well, I'm in the process of doing that myself.
[00:25:34.556 --> 00:25:40.898]  I mean, everyone I know is aware of what I'm doing at the moment, and it's quite concerning.
[00:25:42.250 --> 00:25:46.652]  And there's a few things going on which I'm not sure if you're aware of.
[00:25:47.032 --> 00:25:53.316]  Oh, they're busy taking your rights, they're busy trying to stop the protests, they're trying to get rid of your sovereignty too.
[00:25:54.156 --> 00:25:57.458]  Yeah, not only that but our involvement in East Timor.
[00:25:58.959 --> 00:26:01.780]  Now, there's a few things I've found out recently.
[00:26:02.040 --> 00:26:08.924]  A leaked document from the Defence Force which specifically says that a main point of the
[00:26:10.626 --> 00:26:18.532]  The involvement of the Defence was to seek access and to exercise influence over the East Timorese decision-making in the Government.
[00:26:19.413 --> 00:26:32.082]  Now, that sort of leads on to the copious amounts of gold, nickel, other precious metals, oil and natural gas in the country, which we're taking a hell of a lot of percentages of.
[00:26:34.969 --> 00:26:39.273]  Yeah, Australia is involved trying to dominate a lot of different areas of your region.
[00:26:40.134 --> 00:26:40.934]  I am aware of that.
[00:26:41.735 --> 00:26:43.457]  Anything else you'd like to add from down under?
[00:26:44.338 --> 00:26:46.039]  Yeah, I'm just curious.
[00:26:46.119 --> 00:26:48.321]  I've been trying to find something else out.
[00:26:49.262 --> 00:26:54.607]  Are you aware of whether John Howard has ever visited or been a part of Bohemian Grove?
[00:26:54.707 --> 00:27:01.213]  Because some of the things he says and does is just very, how would I say, devil-esque almost.
[00:27:02.645 --> 00:27:09.452]  Well, I haven't seen your Prime Minister listed on the membership roster, but there are a lot of visitors and guests.
[00:27:09.492 --> 00:27:12.355]  I know a lot of foreign heads of state do visit the Bohemian Grove.
[00:27:12.816 --> 00:27:16.680]  That, incidentally, kicks off in just four days.
[00:27:17.220 --> 00:27:19.823]  They're going to be having a... Another cremation of care!
[00:27:20.243 --> 00:27:28.227]  Yeah, I guess they're going to be having like a 132nd annual cremation of care there in Northern California and engaging in their rituals.
[00:27:28.627 --> 00:27:30.848]  Good to hear from you from down under, my friend.
[00:27:30.868 --> 00:27:31.568]  Thanks for the call.
[00:27:32.089 --> 00:27:34.370]  Now let's go a little bit closer to home.
[00:27:34.430 --> 00:27:36.251]  Let's go to Moses in Texas.
[00:27:36.731 --> 00:27:37.791]  Moses, you're on the air.
[00:27:37.831 --> 00:27:38.172]  Welcome.
[00:27:38.752 --> 00:27:41.073]  Good afternoon, Alexander at the Battle for God Jones.
[00:27:41.093 --> 00:27:45.435]  I just have a couple quick takes and then I'll jump off the line.
[00:27:46.367 --> 00:27:54.232]  Thanks to you, GCN, and the other station, in spite of its owner, you know, it gives out solid info in times like these.
[00:27:54.852 --> 00:27:57.854]  And, you know, some of the callers are kind of irreplaceable.
[00:27:58.175 --> 00:28:05.699]  And just a quick shout-out to Ron in New York, Jeff in Mass, fella Texans, Rita, Rodney, Gal, Stu, Kevin, Smith, and Horton.
[00:28:08.581 --> 00:28:09.962]  Congrats to your symposium.
[00:28:10.580 --> 00:28:12.241]  That you had out in L.A.
[00:28:12.342 --> 00:28:12.442]  on 9-11.
[00:28:12.942 --> 00:28:15.204]  Getting like-minded people together is always a plus.
[00:28:15.684 --> 00:28:19.668]  Despite the fact that feds are probably all over that place like ants at a summer picnic.
[00:28:21.549 --> 00:28:25.393]  But like I said, getting like-minded people together is always good.
[00:28:26.053 --> 00:28:32.078]  In spite of that fact, I hope that you pulled out some unity strategy and organization because Empire has it.
[00:28:32.339 --> 00:28:32.979]  Do the Rebels?
[00:28:33.540 --> 00:28:38.284]  Because if they did, I heard about some folks up in South Dakota working on Amendment E.
[00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:40.561]  They would have a lot of support.
[00:28:40.841 --> 00:28:41.641]  I hear you.
[00:28:41.681 --> 00:28:43.002]  Listen, I appreciate your call.
[00:28:43.022 --> 00:28:53.187]  You know, as for your comment about feds crawling all over something, there are probably two or three feds in there writing up reports on the 1,200 people that attended our 9-11 symposium.
[00:28:53.567 --> 00:28:54.167]  So what?
[00:28:54.647 --> 00:28:55.788]  We'll wake them up.
[00:28:56.628 --> 00:29:00.150]  Again, most people I know in and out of government are now waking up, again.
[00:29:01.096 --> 00:29:03.057]  Most censorship is self-censorship.
[00:29:03.117 --> 00:29:06.618]  Most control is... Most mind control is passive.
[00:29:06.658 --> 00:29:15.302]  The globalists just convince people to buy into their lie and to think that truth-tellers are bad and that 9-11 truth-seekers are liars.
[00:29:15.382 --> 00:29:19.264]  And when people in government find out we're telling the truth, they join our ranks.
[00:29:19.324 --> 00:29:20.084]  That's happening.
[00:29:20.464 --> 00:29:26.167]  As more and more prominent people go public, the lie begins to crumble faster and faster.
[00:29:27.535 --> 00:29:30.776]  Come back, talk to JR, Jason, Kurt, and many others.
[00:29:30.836 --> 00:29:33.357]  Total free number to join us, wide open phones, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:29:33.497 --> 00:29:41.980]  The director of Scanner Darkly, Richard Linkletter, my good friend, will be joining us for 30 minutes to the next hour.
[00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:45.462]  We got Jack McClam, police and military against the New World Order in the third hour.
[00:29:51.924 --> 00:29:54.825]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.838 --> 00:29:58.532]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.750 --> 00:30:07.011]  Dry, cracked heels used to be a real problem for me, especially in the summer when I wear sandals.
[00:30:07.292 --> 00:30:09.892]  My husband would say, your heels are like sandpaper.
[00:30:10.312 --> 00:30:12.873]  But then my podiatrist gave me Calyx Ointment.
[00:30:13.233 --> 00:30:18.194]  It's diabetic-friendly and smooths cracked heels and calluses using natural enzymes.
[00:30:18.435 --> 00:30:21.976]  Calyx never stings or burns and made my heels baby soft.
[00:30:22.296 --> 00:30:23.856]  Now they look and feel great!
[00:30:24.196 --> 00:30:27.677]  If you have calluses or dry, cracked heels, try Calyx Ointment.
[00:30:27.997 --> 00:30:30.898]  You can find it at Walgreens and Longs in the foot care section.
[00:30:32.352 --> 00:30:34.834]  Are your Federal Reserve notes looking for a safe haven?
[00:30:35.294 --> 00:30:37.215]  Mine found it in precious metals.
[00:30:37.916 --> 00:30:41.098]  Not paper promises, but actual gold in my possession.
[00:30:41.738 --> 00:30:48.222]  It is liquid, it is private, it owes no one, it cannot go bankrupt, and it maintains its purchasing power.
[00:30:49.003 --> 00:30:51.204]  Find your answer at Midas Resources.
[00:30:51.584 --> 00:30:52.024]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:30:52.104 --> 00:30:53.485]  The answer is at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:31:01.860 --> 00:31:03.481]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:31:03.621 --> 00:31:07.724]  You know murky water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[00:31:07.864 --> 00:31:10.745]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[00:31:10.825 --> 00:31:17.549]  The powerful black murky purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[00:31:17.730 --> 00:31:20.731]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[00:31:20.932 --> 00:31:23.313]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[00:31:23.453 --> 00:31:28.176]  Black murky elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove
[00:31:28.356 --> 00:31:42.921]  Trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as Atcozine, Benzene, Chloride and Chloroform, MTBE, Radon-222, foul taste and obnoxious odors like Sulfur, even Nitrates, and unwanted heavy metals such as Lead, Mercury, and Aluminum are extracted.
[00:31:43.081 --> 00:31:49.704]  Supercharge your gravity filter today and order a 2-pack of Black Berkey Purification Elements for only $96 or a 4-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at

[00:33:11.960 --> 00:33:13.901]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:33:13.921 --> 00:33:14.702]  until 2 p.m.
[00:33:14.742 --> 00:33:16.963]  Central Standard Time, that's 12 noon to 3 p.m.
[00:33:17.324 --> 00:33:20.406]  We're here live, 12 noon to 3 p.m.
[00:33:20.446 --> 00:33:22.607]  Eastern, back from 9 to midnight.
[00:33:23.888 --> 00:33:26.870]  We're going to go back to your calls JR, Kurt, Steve, Amy,
[00:33:27.734 --> 00:33:29.355]  And many others here in just a few minutes.
[00:33:29.955 --> 00:33:31.436]  I do want to get more into North Korea.
[00:33:31.536 --> 00:33:33.037]  Set for more missile tests.
[00:33:33.597 --> 00:33:35.998]  Lilly asking for it, helping the neocons along.
[00:33:36.438 --> 00:33:42.101]  As usual, and why not, the neocons help give them the missiles and the reactors to enrich the uranium.
[00:33:43.514 --> 00:33:49.198]  The NSA is defending itself in court saying no one's allowed to sue it or investigate it because of national security.
[00:33:49.218 --> 00:33:52.580]  The perfect cover for the criminal activities they're engaging in.
[00:33:52.620 --> 00:33:54.021]  Colorado, OK's toughest U.S.
[00:33:54.061 --> 00:33:54.821]  immigration bill.
[00:33:55.201 --> 00:33:57.263]  That's the headline of the Associated Press.
[00:33:57.283 --> 00:33:58.223]  I don't know if I agree with that.
[00:33:58.543 --> 00:34:04.187]  Really big news, man indicted in phone jamming case will argue administration approval of election scheme.
[00:34:04.207 --> 00:34:05.888]  We'll do that after we take a raft of calls.
[00:34:08.249 --> 00:34:11.051]  But first, Debbie Morrow, New Millennium Concepts.
[00:34:11.977 --> 00:34:15.479]  Made in America, the American Berkey, also the British Berkey if you choose.
[00:34:15.519 --> 00:34:18.901]  The American Berkey is an even higher standard made right here in America.
[00:34:18.921 --> 00:34:28.405]  And you get wholesale pricing on your purchase when you buy through New Millennium, the manufacturer of the black Berkey elements.
[00:34:29.086 --> 00:34:32.727]  They have them in stainless steel, they have them in Lexan, hardened plastic.
[00:34:33.268 --> 00:34:36.489]  They have travel Berkeys, they have little sports Berkeys.
[00:34:36.790 --> 00:34:41.372]  So from $20 up to $300 and something bucks, they got filters that do
[00:34:42.299 --> 00:34:44.661]  Tens and tens of thousands of gallons in their lifetime.
[00:34:44.982 --> 00:34:48.265]  Hundreds of gallons a day down to units that are just a few gallons a day.
[00:34:48.765 --> 00:34:50.987]  You really need to call Debbie and get a free catalog.
[00:34:51.007 --> 00:34:56.793]  You need to go to their website, Berkeywater.com or go to Infowars.com and link through.
[00:34:57.945 --> 00:35:07.149]  Over to Berkeywater.com, there's a big banner on the left hand side of the page where you can get all the same specials and same filters at InfoWars.com off of our secure online Yahoo shopping cart.
[00:35:07.689 --> 00:35:09.610]  But Debbie, thank you for coming on with us.
[00:35:10.050 --> 00:35:12.411]  Hi Alex, thank you very much for having me.
[00:35:12.451 --> 00:35:13.711]  We have some new specials.
[00:35:14.471 --> 00:35:15.292]  Tell us about those.
[00:35:15.492 --> 00:35:22.535]  Well, you know, over the years I've had people call me and say, do you all have flashlights with LEDs?
[00:35:22.615 --> 00:35:23.375]  And I say no.
[00:35:24.056 --> 00:35:26.577]  You know, because they thought the Berkey Light was a flashlight.
[00:35:26.657 --> 00:35:29.598]  So what we did was we did get some new Millennium Flashlights.
[00:35:29.698 --> 00:35:31.158]  And we have three different models.
[00:35:31.778 --> 00:35:34.419]  And we're going to give them away with the Berkey Light systems.
[00:35:34.999 --> 00:35:45.042]  We have the LED flashlight that's like about a six inch flashlight with a five different smart... It's called a smart switch.
[00:35:45.642 --> 00:35:47.483]  And it does five different functions.
[00:35:48.203 --> 00:35:51.504]  And you can get that for free with the Berkey Light without light.
[00:35:52.347 --> 00:35:56.529]  Or with the travel Berkey or with a regular big Berkey with two filters in it.
[00:35:57.289 --> 00:36:10.273]  And then we have this really great LED headlamp which people really like because it has a swivel on it so you can move the headlamp and it goes around your head on a strap.
[00:36:10.934 --> 00:36:18.316]  And you can have that one for free with the Berkey light with light or the Royal, Imperial or Crown Berkeys.
[00:36:18.857 --> 00:36:19.977]  And we also have
[00:36:20.580 --> 00:36:34.429]  These really neat little LED keychain flashlights, the five pack of them, and we're giving that away with, you know, any orders that are over like $325 if they get, you know, a system with it.
[00:36:35.210 --> 00:36:46.177]  And I was looking in a catalog just last night, and it was like, you know, one of those things that you get in the mail, and they had LED keychain flashlights, and they were like $20 a piece.
[00:36:49.092 --> 00:36:53.977]  And we sell the five pack of them for under, I think, $35.
[00:36:54.037 --> 00:36:59.081]  Well Debbie, all of that is wonderful, but basically, you know, the key here is filtering your water.
[00:36:59.142 --> 00:37:04.887]  The water is filled with hundreds of allowable poisons, toxins, herbicides, oil.
[00:37:05.567 --> 00:37:10.432]  I don't know how anyone could drink tap water, and then bottled water, it's on record, is not safe.
[00:37:11.477 --> 00:37:18.800]  You save a lot of money, and you can spend $10,000 plus dollars and get a big system put in your house that's always breaking down and having problems.
[00:37:19.180 --> 00:37:21.861]  Believe me, years ago, before I knew about big Berkeys, I tried all this.
[00:37:23.082 --> 00:37:27.083]  I mean, you spend, what, $199 to get the basic Berkey.
[00:37:27.403 --> 00:37:32.625]  You can spend $259 to get the Berkey light with the LEDs and the chargers built into it.
[00:37:33.486 --> 00:37:36.647]  You've got little solar panels that you can also purchase that go with it.
[00:37:37.487 --> 00:37:39.588]  And again, that's not part of the water filtration system.
[00:37:39.608 --> 00:37:47.930]  It's just a lighting system and plug-in system to run cell phones and other things off of a base that comes with the filters.
[00:37:47.950 --> 00:37:51.971]  So it can kind of be a little emergency life support system.
[00:37:51.991 --> 00:37:54.852]  And then you've got the water filters that are sport filters.
[00:37:55.272 --> 00:37:57.693]  They don't cut everything out like the big Berkeys.
[00:37:57.713 --> 00:38:02.775]  They just make the water safe to drink and really reduce the toxicity of the water.
[00:38:02.795 --> 00:38:03.095]  What, 130 refills?
[00:38:04.967 --> 00:38:05.427]  I think so.
[00:38:28.072 --> 00:38:30.293]  I don't know how people couldn't or wouldn't call you.
[00:38:30.333 --> 00:38:32.333]  I don't either and especially right now.
[00:38:58.171 --> 00:39:05.093]  You know, it's really very imperative that people start taking control of their life and birthing their water.
[00:39:05.813 --> 00:39:16.116]  And it's, um, the season is coming and, you know, we don't want people to wait until the last second and then have us try and get something to them that can't get there.
[00:39:16.176 --> 00:39:21.617]  So, you know, the lines are open and this is a great time for people to give us a call.
[00:39:22.583 --> 00:39:26.185]  And we'll be glad to take their orders and get their orders shipped right away for them.
[00:39:26.225 --> 00:39:27.845]  Well, that happened last year during the hurricane.
[00:39:27.865 --> 00:39:33.388]  You guys actually got behind a week or so just in manufacturing because things got so crazy with the hurricanes.
[00:39:33.448 --> 00:39:40.611]  And it's great to have this for emergencies, but I want people to get it to stop drinking all this poison in the water and start using it right now.
[00:39:41.011 --> 00:39:42.172]  Folks, give Debbie a call.
[00:39:42.927 --> 00:39:53.093]  1-888-803-4438, 1-888-803-4438, or Berkeywater.com or Infowars.com.
[00:39:53.414 --> 00:39:55.095]  Debbie, thank you so much for spending time with us.
[00:39:55.115 --> 00:39:55.595]  Thank you.
[00:39:55.615 --> 00:39:56.536]  Talk to you soon.
[00:39:56.696 --> 00:39:57.036]  You bet.
[00:39:57.396 --> 00:39:59.037]  Folks, give her a call if you missed that number.
[00:39:59.097 --> 00:39:59.578]  Don't wait.
[00:39:59.638 --> 00:40:02.499]  Even if you're listening tonight, call, leave your name and number, she'll call you back.
[00:40:02.519 --> 00:40:03.120]  1-888-803-4438.
[00:40:03.140 --> 00:40:05.822]  Alright, let's go ahead and go back to your phone calls.
[00:40:11.665 --> 00:40:13.146]  Amy in New York first.
[00:40:13.706 --> 00:40:14.567]  Amy, you're on the air.
[00:40:15.588 --> 00:40:19.410]  Hi Alex, I just want to let you know I have a quick comment and a question.
[00:40:20.030 --> 00:40:37.221]  I noticed driving through downtown there's a building with some graffiti on it and one day I realized that the word Infowars.com and Present Planet were spray painted on the building and about a week later they were covered up with paint and all the other graffiti has never been covered so I just thought that was kind of strange.
[00:40:38.361 --> 00:40:39.422]  And my question is
[00:40:40.023 --> 00:40:44.146]  Has anything been on C-SPAN regarding the 9-11 symposium?
[00:40:44.226 --> 00:40:46.367]  I've been checking and haven't been able to find anything.
[00:40:46.387 --> 00:40:48.909]  I'm wondering if you know what's going on with that.
[00:40:49.790 --> 00:40:58.295]  We have received, no exaggeration, hundreds of phone calls at this office, hundreds of emails.
[00:40:59.336 --> 00:41:04.720]  In fact, it's been so long, two plus weeks since they videotaped it, we're even getting letters now.
[00:41:05.919 --> 00:41:08.320]  And people are asking, where is it?
[00:41:08.401 --> 00:41:17.886]  C-SPAN customarily airs it within a week of panel discussion, sometimes within two to three weeks, so they've got another week or so until we know something's going on.
[00:41:17.946 --> 00:41:31.014]  But that roundtable discussion, that panel discussion with Professor Fetzer and, of course, Bob Bowman, former head of the Star Wars program, and Professor Jones and Webster Tarpley and myself,
[00:41:31.627 --> 00:41:38.688]  It was so hard-hitting and so cutting-edge and hardcore that in my gut I thought they'd never air it.
[00:41:38.809 --> 00:41:40.349]  But we didn't hold back either.
[00:41:40.729 --> 00:41:44.650]  We laid out the facts and it's so devastating, I don't know if they will.
[00:41:44.990 --> 00:41:46.530]  And I haven't given out C-SPAN's number.
[00:41:46.550 --> 00:41:47.150]  Let's be clear.
[00:41:47.970 --> 00:41:53.952]  When I was out of town a few days before the event, Jack Blood and others did get on air and say, you know, you ought to call C-SPAN and get them to cover it.
[00:41:54.432 --> 00:41:55.312]  And that was a good idea.
[00:41:55.452 --> 00:41:57.132]  People did call C-SPAN, they did cover it.
[00:41:57.472 --> 00:41:59.973]  They had a three-man team there, two cameras.
[00:42:01.466 --> 00:42:05.028]  And the C-SPAN crew, by the way, was convinced.
[00:42:05.068 --> 00:42:07.010]  They love the conference, but where is it?
[00:42:08.010 --> 00:42:18.817]  You know, bombarding the poor secretaries that field the phone calls, I guess is okay, but I really think the calls should be directed to all live C-SPAN programming.
[00:42:19.217 --> 00:42:23.860]  You know, after the Senate has a vote and they open the phones up for 30 minutes for comments, boom, hit them.
[00:42:24.181 --> 00:42:26.262]  When they have Washington Journal, boom, hit them.
[00:42:26.862 --> 00:42:27.743]  And, you know, call in,
[00:42:28.613 --> 00:42:31.134]  And just say, hey, where's the 9-11 Neocon Symposium?
[00:42:31.394 --> 00:42:33.755]  The PrisonPlanet.com, InfoWars.com covered.
[00:42:33.995 --> 00:42:34.935]  Give those websites out.
[00:42:34.955 --> 00:42:47.939]  But by the way, if you're a PrisonPlanet.tv member, for 15 cents a day, you can go to PrisonPlanet.tv, watch it in high bandwidth, low bandwidth, downloaded, three different formats, shot by five different cameras.
[00:42:47.959 --> 00:42:49.239]  We have a five camera shoot.
[00:42:49.259 --> 00:42:51.040]  It's a lot better than C-SPAN's coverage.
[00:42:51.400 --> 00:42:54.501]  You can go watch it there, burn copies of it, give it to people, and listen.
[00:42:55.789 --> 00:42:56.850]  I'd give this out for free.
[00:42:57.050 --> 00:43:00.832]  We wouldn't even have PrisonPlanet.tv, but the bandwidth is too expensive.
[00:43:00.852 --> 00:43:09.098]  So, the 15 cents a day with members just pays for the bandwidth and the webmasters, and the thing is breaking even and really helps our operations.
[00:43:09.138 --> 00:43:15.422]  So, get a PrisonPlanet.tv membership and all of you can see what it looks like may be too hot for C-SPAN to handle.
[00:43:19.304 --> 00:43:20.045]  Are you still there, Amy?
[00:43:21.349 --> 00:43:26.070]  Isn't it interesting that the Info Wars and Prison Planet were spray-painted over?
[00:43:26.090 --> 00:43:27.871]  I wish you'd take a photograph of that.
[00:43:27.931 --> 00:43:28.671]  I wish I did.
[00:43:29.111 --> 00:43:29.671]  Well, you know what?
[00:43:29.771 --> 00:43:36.213]  I can take a photo of the building with the covered up paint, but you know, underneath it says the website.
[00:43:36.353 --> 00:43:39.674]  So, all the other graffiti has been left alone for years.
[00:43:41.675 --> 00:43:42.475]  How big was it?
[00:43:43.736 --> 00:43:45.876]  Big enough to see it from the road driving by.
[00:43:45.976 --> 00:43:48.617]  Big enough to where people, I'm sure, checked it out.
[00:43:49.788 --> 00:43:50.909]  Give us the address of that.
[00:43:50.969 --> 00:43:52.049]  What's it at the corner of?
[00:43:53.670 --> 00:43:56.271]  It's in Buffalo downtown.
[00:43:56.291 --> 00:43:58.312]  There's a building.
[00:43:58.332 --> 00:44:00.472]  It's not really on a corner.
[00:44:00.492 --> 00:44:01.933]  It's driving through on the expressway.
[00:44:02.662 --> 00:44:09.068]  I can get you better, I'll email you better directions and I'll try to get a photo of it for you.
[00:44:09.088 --> 00:44:10.409]  Well thank you Amy and thank you for the call.
[00:44:10.429 --> 00:44:18.016]  It's an interesting call how you see just my website's being censored by the establishment and not the other graffiti.
[00:44:18.937 --> 00:44:21.299]  And let me be clear on my position on graffiti.
[00:44:22.360 --> 00:44:25.002]  I think graffiti on private businesses is bad.
[00:44:27.024 --> 00:44:28.886]  Somebody tagged my office
[00:44:30.200 --> 00:44:33.323]  Here, and I haven't removed it, c'est la vie, fine.
[00:44:34.364 --> 00:44:35.405]  I don't have time to deal with it.
[00:44:37.787 --> 00:44:57.664]  But at the same time, I think government, expressways, vacant buildings, especially if it's political messages, that's what original graffiti, or I should say, well, ancient graffiti was about where good hunting spots were, or the name of the tribe, or some celestial
[00:44:58.653 --> 00:44:59.434]  I don't know.
[00:45:18.467 --> 00:45:27.210]  Where I really like it is on billboards, government propaganda billboards, anti-gun billboards, anti-family billboards, police state billboards.
[00:45:27.650 --> 00:45:30.431]  All the time there's graffiti on them in Austin and I'm not doing it.
[00:45:30.611 --> 00:45:33.933]  No one I know is doing it, but I'm not going to lie to you.
[00:45:34.173 --> 00:45:43.216]  The government uses our money to put these messages out to brainwash us and I think it's great that people are climbing up those billboards and spray painting on it.
[00:45:45.209 --> 00:45:50.331]  We paid for that to begin with, so it's good to have the actual people go up there and spray paint on it.
[00:45:51.832 --> 00:45:52.272]  I love it!
[00:45:52.833 --> 00:45:53.613]  So good job!
[00:45:54.193 --> 00:45:58.095]  And we know they've tagged government buildings, they've tagged old facades of old buildings.
[00:45:58.135 --> 00:46:03.998]  I've gotten emails from New Zealand, Canada, just all over the country, and half the time we're so busy we don't post it.
[00:46:04.018 --> 00:46:11.001]  We should have an area on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com where street art, political messages are posted.
[00:46:12.367 --> 00:46:15.468]  And so I'm not telling people to go out and start tagging everything.
[00:46:17.249 --> 00:46:20.251]  Though there are InfoWars.com bumper stickers all over the place.
[00:46:20.291 --> 00:46:22.091]  I've been walking down the street in New York and seen one.
[00:46:22.732 --> 00:46:27.274]  People, friends and family all the time are in foreign cities or in Canada or in England and see it.
[00:46:27.714 --> 00:46:31.115]  And it's a great way to get the message out at the street level.
[00:46:31.135 --> 00:46:39.479]  In fact, we've thought about putting stencils in free with orders if people specifically request them.
[00:46:40.490 --> 00:46:42.951]  You know, the actual graffiti stencils.
[00:46:45.892 --> 00:46:47.173]  But we just haven't done it.
[00:46:48.093 --> 00:46:49.133]  I mean, this is a war.
[00:46:49.974 --> 00:46:58.917]  We've got an enemy that controls the dominant airwaves that is lying to us about 9-11, lying to us about the open borders, lying to us about a thousand instances.
[00:46:59.757 --> 00:47:03.699]  And graffiti on a major bridge will be seen by hundreds of thousands of people in a week.
[00:47:04.659 --> 00:47:09.021]  And if it gets painted over, oh dear me, what happens if you climb back on there and spray paint it again?
[00:47:09.898 --> 00:47:11.739]  But please don't do anything dangerous, folks.
[00:47:11.779 --> 00:47:13.461]  I'm not advocating you do that.
[00:47:14.481 --> 00:47:18.204]  I personally have thought about scaling cameras and doing things.
[00:47:18.264 --> 00:47:24.068]  I personally have restrained urges to get spray paint and go out and tag myself.
[00:47:24.428 --> 00:47:25.669]  Something I've never done in my life.
[00:47:27.510 --> 00:47:30.072]  Something I've never done in my life.
[00:47:32.414 --> 00:47:35.716]  Because it's a great form of physical activism.
[00:47:37.256 --> 00:47:38.136]  I want to get the guy on.
[00:47:38.236 --> 00:47:39.217]  I'm going to tell my producer this.
[00:47:39.237 --> 00:47:39.657]  I never did it.
[00:47:39.677 --> 00:47:44.659]  All the time on the weekend I'm reading websites and news and I never get around to telling my producers this.
[00:47:45.099 --> 00:47:48.200]  My wife, Laura, Kevin Smith, who also helps doing it.
[00:47:48.740 --> 00:47:49.541]  I want to get the guy on.
[00:47:49.581 --> 00:47:50.061]  I forget his name.
[00:47:50.101 --> 00:47:52.342]  He has a website who tagged Air Force One.
[00:47:52.362 --> 00:47:57.804]  I mean, they scaled a fence in the dead of night with armed guards walking around in sentries.
[00:47:57.824 --> 00:47:58.664]  There's video of this.
[00:47:59.264 --> 00:48:02.305]  And they scaled and they spray painted Air Force One.
[00:48:03.166 --> 00:48:04.326]  I mean, that is daring.
[00:48:04.766 --> 00:48:05.347]  And it's peaceful.
[00:48:07.088 --> 00:48:08.909]  Notice you didn't hear about that on national news, though.
[00:48:08.929 --> 00:48:10.069]  They don't want you to know about that.
[00:48:11.849 --> 00:48:12.930]  Alright, let's go.
[00:48:12.990 --> 00:48:14.010]  That is bold, folks.
[00:48:14.070 --> 00:48:14.770]  That is courage.
[00:48:15.010 --> 00:48:17.911]  I mean, I don't have the courage to scale some 15-18.
[00:48:18.051 --> 00:48:20.292]  I mean, it's some giant barbed wire fence.
[00:48:20.672 --> 00:48:24.693]  They videotaped the guy jumping it, running up and attacking Air Force One.
[00:48:24.933 --> 00:48:28.054]  And there's armed sentries, troops with guns walking around.
[00:48:28.074 --> 00:48:29.154]  They run right behind them.
[00:48:29.714 --> 00:48:32.655]  I mean, you talk about really Mission Impossible for real.
[00:48:33.749 --> 00:48:36.051]  All right, I'm out of control.
[00:48:36.111 --> 00:48:37.191]  Let's go back to the calls.
[00:48:37.732 --> 00:48:39.033]  Kurt in Texas, you're on the air.
[00:48:39.073 --> 00:48:39.853]  Go ahead, Kurt.
[00:48:40.433 --> 00:48:40.914]  Yes, sir.
[00:48:40.994 --> 00:48:48.239]  Just wanted to let you know a little bit about a limited freedom of speech that happened to me out here in the world.
[00:48:48.259 --> 00:49:02.568]  I hurt my hand about a couple weeks ago and had to go to an emergency clinic here in the town and pulled up in front of it and it had a glass front to the building.
[00:49:03.274 --> 00:49:12.563]  And when they started to usher me into the examination room, the male nurse looked out in front of my vehicle that has several anti-U.N.
[00:49:12.663 --> 00:49:18.589]  stickers as well as the InfoWars sticker on it, and he said, whose car is that?
[00:49:18.869 --> 00:49:19.529]  Let me stop you.
[00:49:19.650 --> 00:49:21.171]  We didn't set this up, folks.
[00:49:21.211 --> 00:49:22.032]  Amy called in.
[00:49:24.361 --> 00:49:26.782]  Kurt called in, and notice it's a theme.
[00:49:26.822 --> 00:49:27.902]  We have this with the calls.
[00:49:28.242 --> 00:49:29.843]  This is almost magical.
[00:49:30.683 --> 00:49:31.863]  I want to know the name of the clinic.
[00:49:32.043 --> 00:49:33.083]  Well, finish your story.
[00:49:33.123 --> 00:49:33.724]  I'm going to shut up.
[00:49:33.964 --> 00:49:34.324]  Go ahead.
[00:49:34.704 --> 00:49:35.064]  Okay.
[00:49:35.704 --> 00:49:38.465]  And he said, whose car is that out front?
[00:49:38.485 --> 00:49:39.485]  And I said, it's mine.
[00:49:40.005 --> 00:49:45.307]  And he said, well, I don't like the stickers and stuff you've got on the front of it.
[00:49:45.767 --> 00:49:47.207]  And I said, well, that's your right.
[00:49:47.267 --> 00:49:49.288]  It's a free country and freedom of speech.
[00:49:49.830 --> 00:49:51.811]  He said, I don't care to hear it.
[00:49:51.851 --> 00:49:57.952]  And he took me back to the examination room and as just a nurse, and he kept pressing the issue.
[00:49:58.032 --> 00:50:03.633]  And I said, listen, I said, it's my right to believe the way I believe in you to believe the way you would believe.
[00:50:04.234 --> 00:50:06.654]  And he says, yeah, but said, I don't have to treat you.
[00:50:06.674 --> 00:50:09.015]  He said, you go find an unpatriotic clinic.
[00:50:09.615 --> 00:50:10.495]  And he put me out.
[00:50:11.455 --> 00:50:13.776]  I want the name of that clinic right now.
[00:50:14.742 --> 00:50:19.488]  It was Minor Emergency Clinic on Barrow in Abilene, Texas.
[00:50:20.088 --> 00:50:25.494]  Minor Emergency Clinic in Abilene.
[00:50:25.795 --> 00:50:26.135]  Yes.
[00:50:28.518 --> 00:50:29.179]  On Barrow?
[00:50:29.619 --> 00:50:30.140]  On Barrow.
[00:50:31.701 --> 00:50:32.923]  And did you get this guy's name?
[00:50:33.813 --> 00:50:39.317]  No, I tried to, and I called back and tried to get it.
[00:50:40.878 --> 00:50:45.081]  By the way, in the past, that was illegal to refuse care, but now they do that more and more.
[00:50:45.121 --> 00:50:46.202]  Tell you what, stay there.
[00:50:46.222 --> 00:50:47.323]  I want to hear more about this, sir.
[00:50:48.504 --> 00:50:49.344]  Oh boy, I tell you.
[00:50:50.325 --> 00:50:50.925]  Stay there, Kurt.
[00:50:51.646 --> 00:50:56.930]  Oh yeah, people pull up at the VA all the time with stickers the cops don't like, and they throw them out.
[00:51:02.972 --> 00:51:05.815]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[00:51:06.075 --> 00:51:07.637]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[00:51:07.997 --> 00:51:12.662]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[00:51:13.002 --> 00:51:19.749]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[00:51:20.069 --> 00:51:22.050]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has arisen.
[00:51:22.250 --> 00:51:25.090]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[00:51:25.190 --> 00:51:29.852]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[00:51:30.052 --> 00:51:34.453]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[00:51:34.693 --> 00:51:41.915]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[00:51:42.175 --> 00:51:44.675]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.
[00:51:44.756 --> 00:51:46.496]  Call toll-free to get a copy of Martial Law.

[00:52:02.248 --> 00:52:07.473]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[00:52:07.613 --> 00:52:15.701]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[00:52:15.961 --> 00:52:23.008]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[00:52:23.949 --> 00:52:30.433]  Potassium Iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[00:52:30.633 --> 00:52:35.717]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[00:52:35.837 --> 00:52:44.723]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[00:52:44.983 --> 00:52:48.286]  Order the official Potassium Iodate for only $24 and save $5.
[00:52:50.367 --> 00:52:51.207]  We're good to go!
[00:53:18.559 --> 00:53:19.239]  We're good to go!
[00:53:48.115 --> 00:53:51.197]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[00:53:51.377 --> 00:53:57.321]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective, natural alternatives and education.
[00:54:07.067 --> 00:54:11.369]  We've gotten confirmed reports of the thing that happened to Kurt all over the country.
[00:54:11.889 --> 00:54:15.732]  It's a minority of people, but they buy into this Stasi
[00:54:16.781 --> 00:54:40.070]  tight mindset of really getting upset at people who have anti-UN stickers, Infowars.com stickers, we have law enforcement manuals, and this has been in the news, it openly say if someone has an anti-UN sticker, go ahead and arrest them, and it tells the police chief, I'm not kidding, we have this posted on the website, mainstream news, police chief support your officers, just go ahead and bring them in, and make sure they're not criminals, because that's a sign of criminality.
[00:54:41.215 --> 00:54:41.995]  It's the opposite.
[00:54:42.015 --> 00:54:42.996]  It's this whole U.N.
[00:54:43.056 --> 00:54:44.836]  system that's getting rid of our borders right now.
[00:54:44.896 --> 00:54:47.097]  But see, they're becoming the minority.
[00:54:47.177 --> 00:54:48.417]  Now it's national news.
[00:54:49.258 --> 00:54:54.719]  Kurt, I mean, describe word for word what this guy said to you, and what was your injury?
[00:54:56.240 --> 00:55:06.663]  My injury, I slipped with a wrench and knocked a big chunk, I mean a very large chunk of hide off of my hand nearly down to the bone on the back.
[00:55:08.406 --> 00:55:11.707]  And I was going there for aid in a tetanus shot.
[00:55:13.628 --> 00:55:25.113]  And the fellow said, well, said people displaying stuff like that that I consider unpatriotic.
[00:55:25.313 --> 00:55:31.475]  And I said, well, that's your right and it's my right to express what I want to.
[00:55:31.835 --> 00:55:32.736]  What did he look like?
[00:55:32.776 --> 00:55:33.536]  What did he look like?
[00:55:34.116 --> 00:55:35.637]  He was just a little small.
[00:55:37.295 --> 00:55:42.038]  A fellow with glasses, a male nurse that they had there.
[00:55:42.238 --> 00:55:44.439]  Sir, you need to go complain to the owners.
[00:55:45.280 --> 00:55:49.923]  Most people are against the UN and major polls and are certainly for the First Amendment.
[00:55:50.263 --> 00:55:52.564]  You need to find out the owner of the facility.
[00:55:52.885 --> 00:55:58.828]  The owner of the facility is a foreign doctor that came to this country.
[00:56:02.365 --> 00:56:04.466]  But the name of it is Minor Emergency Clinic.
[00:56:04.746 --> 00:56:06.207]  Minor Emergency Clinic, yes.
[00:56:06.227 --> 00:56:08.507]  In Abilene, and it's on what street?
[00:56:08.688 --> 00:56:11.649]  Barrow and Southwest Drive.
[00:56:12.849 --> 00:56:14.750]  At the corner of Barrow and Southwest Drive.
[00:56:16.711 --> 00:56:17.491]  Do you have a computer?
[00:56:18.531 --> 00:56:20.932]  No sir, not hooked to the internet, no I don't.
[00:56:21.032 --> 00:56:24.954]  Can you buy a $5 disposable camera and go take pictures of that place and mail them to me?
[00:56:26.595 --> 00:56:27.675]  Yes sir, I can.
[00:56:27.895 --> 00:56:28.815]  I've got several cameras
[00:56:31.184 --> 00:56:34.245]  I can get someone to do it at the present time.
[00:56:34.725 --> 00:56:39.726]  I fell and broke a hip, so I'm not able to do it, but I can get someone to do it.
[00:56:39.926 --> 00:56:42.166]  Did you break the hip after the other accident?
[00:56:42.366 --> 00:56:43.426]  Yes.
[00:56:43.526 --> 00:56:48.287]  I fell in my front yard and broke the hip.
[00:56:48.307 --> 00:56:49.667]  You're going to get better, my friend.
[00:56:49.687 --> 00:56:50.988]  You sound like a real patriot.
[00:56:51.688 --> 00:56:52.588]  I try to.
[00:56:52.608 --> 00:56:58.349]  I duplicate your videos.
[00:56:59.912 --> 00:57:03.693]  Three or four copies a week and try to get them out to people, whoever will take them.
[00:57:04.413 --> 00:57:10.415]  I mean, we've got protesters that protest the Bilderberg threatened to have their arms cut off by the secret police in Canada.
[00:57:10.435 --> 00:57:15.676]  We've got gun dealers being raided because they have anti-Nazi material and my material.
[00:57:15.736 --> 00:57:17.057]  I mean, this is getting scary, isn't it?
[00:57:17.777 --> 00:57:19.417]  It is getting terribly scary.
[00:57:19.938 --> 00:57:26.859]  I do believe that we're in the early stages of 1984, like Orwell wrote just about 26 years later.
[00:57:30.574 --> 00:57:32.956]  Yeah, this guy would fit in nicely.
[00:57:32.996 --> 00:57:34.177]  I'm going to put you on hold.
[00:57:34.497 --> 00:57:35.778]  I want to get your number, Kurt.
[00:57:36.299 --> 00:57:40.882]  Do you have this Pipsqueak's name?
[00:57:42.123 --> 00:57:42.583]  No, sir.
[00:57:42.744 --> 00:57:44.185]  As I said, I called the clinic.
[00:57:44.785 --> 00:57:55.914]  I said, I need to find out who your male corpsman is there that conducts people in.
[00:57:56.154 --> 00:57:57.315]  And she said, why?
[00:57:57.655 --> 00:57:58.175]  Let me guess.
[00:57:58.215 --> 00:57:58.896]  Are you a veteran?
[00:57:59.880 --> 00:58:01.501]  Uh, I've been in the military.
[00:58:01.521 --> 00:58:02.962]  I'm not a veteran of foreign wars.
[00:58:03.042 --> 00:58:03.222]  No.
[00:58:03.423 --> 00:58:05.844]  Well, my point is, is that you've served this country.
[00:58:05.884 --> 00:58:06.945]  It's the classic M.O.
[00:58:07.265 --> 00:58:10.887]  being refused care because they didn't like your bumper stickers.
[00:58:10.927 --> 00:58:11.928]  That's the new America.
[00:58:11.948 --> 00:58:13.489]  Yes, that is.
[00:58:13.929 --> 00:58:21.274]  And uh, I, they said, uh, well, you'd have to talk to such and such lady.
[00:58:21.314 --> 00:58:21.854]  She ain't here.
[00:58:22.355 --> 00:58:24.856]  I said, I wouldn't have to talk to them to get his name.
[00:58:24.876 --> 00:58:26.958]  I said, I would just like to, uh,
[00:58:28.311 --> 00:58:32.235]  I have his name, and she said, well, I'm going to have to put you on hold.
[00:58:32.635 --> 00:58:33.255]  All right, listen.
[00:58:33.816 --> 00:58:35.057]  I'm going to have to put you on hold.
[00:58:35.077 --> 00:58:37.439]  We're going to get your number, and we'll be in contact, Kurt.
[00:58:37.719 --> 00:58:38.360]  We'll be right back.
[00:58:41.803 --> 00:58:46.827]  If you would like a copy of this show, come to GCNlive.com and reserve it today, or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[00:58:57.991 --> 00:58:58.632]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.292 --> 00:59:00.373]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:01.074 --> 00:59:02.175]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.815 --> 00:59:03.636]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.396 --> 00:59:05.337]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.958 --> 00:59:09.761]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.141 --> 00:59:14.224]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:21.906 --> 00:59:29.913]  Well, joining us from New York City, where he's up there promoting the release of A Scanner Darkly, is Richard Linkletter.
[00:59:31.574 --> 00:59:36.218]  One of the most awarded and loved directors in the United States.
[00:59:36.278 --> 00:59:41.242]  He's known for big blockbusters as well as classical avant-garde art films.
[00:59:42.263 --> 00:59:46.927]  And I got to know Rick, I guess going back about seven years ago almost now,
[00:59:47.868 --> 00:59:58.412]  uh... when he was in uh... pre-production of waking life and i was honored to be a part of and then now he's made a scanner darkly which and no exaggeration i spent about an hour and a half
[00:59:59.153 --> 01:00:07.697]  This weekend, reading reviews on Sunday night of it, and I read about 30 or 40 of them and found one semi-negative review by E!
[01:00:07.817 --> 01:00:10.258]  Entertainment, just saying the film's just too much.
[01:00:10.738 --> 01:00:11.458]  Too much happening.
[01:00:12.399 --> 01:00:13.639]  You cannot put it in a box.
[01:00:13.739 --> 01:00:22.163]  It is so amazing, and it opened limitedly here this weekend to packed houses and will be opening all over the country in the next month.
[01:00:22.883 --> 01:00:29.049]  And it is star-studded, and it is indescribably dynamic, and you all need to get out there and see it.
[01:00:29.089 --> 01:00:31.971]  And yes, I have a little cameo in the film as well.
[01:00:32.332 --> 01:00:34.994]  Richard Linkletter, it's been five years since I had you on the radio.
[01:00:35.054 --> 01:00:36.776]  Last time we were promoting Waking Life.
[01:00:36.816 --> 01:00:37.857]  Thanks for spending time with us.
[01:00:38.257 --> 01:00:39.458]  Hey Alex, how you doing, man?
[01:00:39.778 --> 01:00:40.519]  Good, my friend.
[01:00:40.539 --> 01:00:41.960]  All right.
[01:00:43.542 --> 01:00:44.843]  I bet you've been busy this weekend.
[01:00:45.856 --> 01:00:47.737]  Well, actually, not too busy.
[01:00:47.857 --> 01:00:49.999]  Once the movie opens, I don't have much to do.
[01:00:50.019 --> 01:00:56.824]  They keep me busy right up to that moment, you know, doing interviews and stuff, but now it's just kind of out of my hands, you know.
[01:00:56.884 --> 01:00:58.325]  The baby's gone off to college.
[01:00:58.345 --> 01:00:59.165]  I don't have much to do.
[01:00:59.966 --> 01:01:01.507]  Well, I tell you, it was quite a baby.
[01:01:02.347 --> 01:01:04.449]  Rick, what do you think of the reviews?
[01:01:04.509 --> 01:01:05.650]  All I've seen is positive.
[01:01:06.690 --> 01:01:12.734]  I think the vibe out there's pretty good, which is surprisingly, it's such a non-mainstream kind of
[01:01:14.085 --> 01:01:20.869]  Crazy movie, you know, that really challenges a lot of, I don't know, assumptions out there, you know.
[01:01:21.829 --> 01:01:23.911]  I'm surprised it's doing so well.
[01:01:24.151 --> 01:01:26.632]  But, I mean, not everybody loves it.
[01:01:26.652 --> 01:01:27.873]  You know, it's not for everybody.
[01:01:27.993 --> 01:01:33.656]  But, yeah, I've got to be pleased that it seems timely, I think, in a lot of ways.
[01:01:33.676 --> 01:01:36.498]  And that's what people, I think, maybe are responding to.
[01:01:37.629 --> 01:01:47.613]  I haven't given away much on air or in articles I've written or people who work with me have written about the film, but you did give a little bit away in a Chronicle interview.
[01:01:47.653 --> 01:01:57.256]  I don't know how far you want to go, but I tell you, this film is extremely timely and the media has been bringing that up to you, how much this mirrors what we see happening today.
[01:01:58.436 --> 01:02:00.517]  Yeah, I mean, even people, if they don't
[01:02:01.306 --> 01:02:28.629]  totally understand the movie or, you know, it's a complex movie, but they get the basic message about in this future world, it's set seven years in the future, where, you know, these people are more or less under surveillance all the time, all your calls are, you know, being tapped, all your, you know, actions sort of are monitored, you know, in a population that's pretty, pretty used to it, you know, there's not a lot of
[01:02:29.249 --> 01:02:34.051]  With the exception of your character, Alex, there's not a lot of resistance we see going on anywhere.
[01:02:34.131 --> 01:02:51.917]  People adapt pretty easily to this, and I think that's what... it seems like kind of a nightmarish scenario, but it's presented pretty... in a pretty normal fashion, so I think that sort of got people thinking about, oh gosh, we're just sheep being led to this kind of... this conditioning sort of works eventually, you know?
[01:02:51.937 --> 01:02:57.419]  So, I think people responding to... to that, and, you know, current...
[01:02:59.042 --> 01:03:16.245]  You know just everything going on right now every couple weeks we find out something new from our You know some secret stuff our government's doing you know whether it's NSA wiretapping or you know just any number of things just constant so I think yeah, it's a real suspicious time right now.
[01:03:16.285 --> 01:03:17.206]  I think it's a lot like
[01:03:18.624 --> 01:03:23.907]  Post, you know, Nixon period where we realize the government's not being straight with us at all.
[01:03:24.788 --> 01:03:28.490]  And that's when Philip K. Dick wrote this novel in 1977.
[01:03:28.851 --> 01:03:32.493]  I want to talk about PKD and the critics are saying this is the closest
[01:03:33.271 --> 01:03:35.572]  True adaptation from the novel.
[01:03:36.833 --> 01:03:38.394]  You tried to be true to that.
[01:03:38.454 --> 01:03:39.094]  I want to speak about it.
[01:03:39.114 --> 01:03:42.957]  I also want to talk about the production and post-production of this film.
[01:03:42.997 --> 01:03:43.957]  Really two films.
[01:03:44.537 --> 01:03:49.040]  And I want to talk about some of the other facets of this film.
[01:03:49.320 --> 01:03:50.901]  We'll be right back with Richard Linklater.
[01:03:53.678 --> 01:04:00.503]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1 The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[01:04:00.823 --> 01:04:02.184]  That's right folks, DVD.
[01:04:02.384 --> 01:04:04.585]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[01:04:04.745 --> 01:04:06.827]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[01:04:07.107 --> 01:04:12.050]  If you want to wake up your friends and families to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[01:04:12.390 --> 01:04:16.413]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.

[01:04:29.304 --> 01:04:31.226]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.

[01:06:00.325 --> 01:06:05.567]  Wow John, I guess you took my advice and visited that website we were talking about over lunch last time we met.
[01:06:06.127 --> 01:06:10.268]  www.DidYouRobBillGates.com I did, and you were right.
[01:06:10.588 --> 01:06:15.490]  I learn how to make $3,000 to $9,000 each and every week, starting with my very first week.
[01:06:15.910 --> 01:06:18.351]  And it's a simple program that does all the work for you.
[01:06:18.671 --> 01:06:22.033]  I'm already up to $25,000 just going on my fifth week.
[01:06:22.253 --> 01:06:23.153]  Whoa, that's awesome!
[01:06:23.513 --> 01:06:25.895]  John, your business will keep growing as mine has.
[01:06:26.255 --> 01:06:28.496]  In fact, people are joining from all over the world.
[01:06:28.616 --> 01:06:29.297]  It's incredible!
[01:06:29.657 --> 01:06:37.121]  Everyone should go to www.DidYouRobBillGates.com and learn how this program can help them become financially independent, too.
[01:06:37.462 --> 01:06:42.384]  Thanks a million, Bill, for telling me about www.DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[01:06:43.005 --> 01:06:43.705]  Check, please.
[01:06:44.146 --> 01:06:45.046]  I got this one, Bill.
[01:06:45.426 --> 01:06:46.107]  Sure, John.
[01:06:46.267 --> 01:06:50.870]  Let's tell everyone about www.DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[01:06:51.010 --> 01:06:51.250]  Deal.
[01:06:53.388 --> 01:06:58.390]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:58.791 --> 01:07:01.052]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:07:15.991 --> 01:07:17.232]  Alright, welcome ladies and gentlemen.
[01:07:17.252 --> 01:07:19.933]  8 minutes, 30 seconds into this second hour.
[01:07:19.993 --> 01:07:22.475]  Richard Linklater, award-winning director.
[01:07:22.675 --> 01:07:27.117]  He's directed blockbusters and critically acclaimed art films as well.
[01:07:27.938 --> 01:07:30.039]  The first big movie he made was Slacker.
[01:07:31.034 --> 01:07:44.920]  And he joins us right now to talk about his new film that released in some of the major cities around the country and will be opening up nationwide in the next month or so, A Scanner, Darkly with Keanu Reeves, Winona Ryder, Robert Downey Jr., Woody Harrelson, and many, many others.
[01:07:45.840 --> 01:07:58.105]  Rick, jumping straight into it, when did you first get attracted to Philip K. Dick and then run through it, kind of in a thumbnail sketch, how this project developed, how you wrote the script, and the production and the post-production?
[01:07:58.982 --> 01:07:59.342]  Wow.
[01:07:59.462 --> 01:08:00.383]  I mean, that's a long process.
[01:08:00.403 --> 01:08:00.923]  That's a big one!
[01:08:01.263 --> 01:08:03.285]  But I always liked Philip K. Dick.
[01:08:03.325 --> 01:08:05.026]  I didn't read him really as a teenager.
[01:08:05.066 --> 01:08:07.147]  I came to him a little later, you know, in my 20s.
[01:08:08.148 --> 01:08:12.350]  And just, I mean, he's not like a lot of science fiction writers.
[01:08:12.430 --> 01:08:18.054]  I mean, to me, his people are just really normal Joes, like everybody else, who are trying to get through the world.
[01:08:18.934 --> 01:08:25.758]  And he just had such a great imagination and just kind of an incredible mind.
[01:08:26.459 --> 01:08:28.540]  And he's very funny, really humorous.
[01:08:29.414 --> 01:08:32.215]  You know, kind of wickedly funny, darkly humorous.
[01:08:32.275 --> 01:08:42.499]  So, in this movie, I really wanted to bring out the humor of his writing through these characters, because that is the story, really, the humor here.
[01:08:42.539 --> 01:08:55.484]  So, I think it was after Waking Life, Tommy Pallotta and I were talking about... Philip K. Dick sort of permeated our thinking on that movie, so I was thinking, you know, that maybe if Philip K. Dick
[01:08:56.721 --> 01:09:20.837]  Novel or story would work for this animation and I started thinking about Scanner Darkly and that it would work really well and Because it puts your kind of it's a disorienting Story the characters having a the main character counter reads characters having a split brain phenomenon and he's addicted to this Drug, there's a drug epidemic in the future.
[01:09:20.917 --> 01:09:24.860]  So the animation sort of puts the viewers mind in that and
[01:09:25.620 --> 01:09:32.425]  In a similar state of, you know, surreal, where you don't really know what's real and what's not.
[01:09:32.465 --> 01:09:34.626]  And he's also a member of the secret police.
[01:09:34.706 --> 01:09:41.711]  There's this giant Halliburton-type corporation, Newpath, hanging over the entire atmosphere.
[01:09:42.051 --> 01:09:46.014]  Yeah, it's a future world where the government sort of has just privatized everything.
[01:09:46.034 --> 01:09:54.780]  So they've more or less outsourced this war on drugs to a big corporation, a quasi-governmental corporation that's outside the boundaries of accountability.
[01:09:55.876 --> 01:09:59.337]  So, you know, they've got their own private contracts with the government and everything.
[01:09:59.377 --> 01:10:04.338]  Philip K. Dick kind of saw the future before it was even called the drug war.
[01:10:04.358 --> 01:10:10.360]  He saw the extremes of where that was going.
[01:10:10.740 --> 01:10:15.641]  And as I wrote this in late 01, this whole movie came up.
[01:10:15.981 --> 01:10:20.463]  I think it seemed even more urgent to me in a post 9-11 environment.
[01:10:21.123 --> 01:10:21.603]  I was reading
[01:10:22.099 --> 01:10:24.220]  This book saying, well, this is really about right now.
[01:10:24.300 --> 01:10:44.874]  It's easy to imagine the future where the endless unwinnable drug war would sort of meld in with the endless unwinnable war on terror and how governments and corporations could profiteer and the effects of that on the individual, on the citizens, the numbing effects
[01:10:46.029 --> 01:10:49.571]  So it's this huge cautionary tale on a lot of levels.
[01:10:49.871 --> 01:10:54.393]  Is that what attracted this huge A-list of top actors?
[01:10:54.633 --> 01:10:56.994]  What did they end up being paid?
[01:10:57.034 --> 01:10:59.595]  Like $60,000 or something apiece?
[01:10:59.655 --> 01:11:03.477]  And Keanu Reeves has made $100 million on one movie before.
[01:11:04.597 --> 01:11:11.260]  Well, you know, actors are artists who are looking for a good part, always, in something they can chew into.
[01:11:11.280 --> 01:11:15.122]  And I think everyone saw the depth of Philip K. Dick's ideas here.
[01:11:15.825 --> 01:11:18.527]  I don't think I would have got this movie made otherwise without this list of
[01:11:37.509 --> 01:11:40.870]  You know, without this wonderful cast, but they're all perfectly cast.
[01:11:40.930 --> 01:11:43.391]  Robert Downey Jr., Woody Harrelson, Winona Ryder.
[01:11:43.411 --> 01:11:45.552]  Personally, I think Robert Downey Jr.
[01:11:45.632 --> 01:11:46.433]  is the most powerful.
[01:11:47.313 --> 01:11:48.974]  Well, he's Barrett.
[01:11:49.014 --> 01:11:54.436]  He's this one character who's just totally off the hook, you know, and Robert's probably one of the only people who could play that part.
[01:11:54.456 --> 01:11:56.977]  But he's like so many scumbags I've known in real life.
[01:11:58.878 --> 01:12:02.760]  He's like every roommate you had in your 20s who just kind of drifted into your house.
[01:12:03.380 --> 01:12:05.721]  You know, so I knew all these guys, you know, so.
[01:12:06.912 --> 01:12:19.581]  But I think they're all wonderful, and we had a great time making it, but a lot was going on at the time we were making it, so we would sit around and talk politics, talk, you know, the deeper meaning of everything, and we had a great time making it.
[01:12:19.621 --> 01:12:21.443]  We shot the film very inexpensively.
[01:12:21.483 --> 01:12:22.663]  We did it on a low budget.
[01:12:22.823 --> 01:12:25.465]  Everybody worked for scale, that kind of production.
[01:12:25.485 --> 01:12:30.229]  That's the only way you get anything real, you know, made.
[01:12:30.780 --> 01:12:32.361]  Well, I think that's a key point here.
[01:12:32.381 --> 01:12:38.544]  You know, we hear the term avant-garde or something totally new before it's time thrown around a lot, but this is avant-garde.
[01:12:38.584 --> 01:12:40.926]  I mean, this is a rebel picture in my opinion.
[01:12:41.286 --> 01:12:47.529]  It was made against all the odds, some trials and tribulations, which I think in a way makes it even sweeter, but I want to get your take on that.
[01:12:47.609 --> 01:12:48.850]  But secondarily...
[01:12:49.819 --> 01:12:54.501]  I mean, it was revolutionary the way you did this rotoscoping, the incredible quality of it.
[01:12:55.001 --> 01:13:00.944]  There have been big reports written by some of the big animation sites saying that this would take Disney $100 million to make.
[01:13:00.984 --> 01:13:03.044]  You guys did it for about $9 million.
[01:13:03.425 --> 01:13:11.868]  And not just the look of it, getting all these big stars, and then it's funny, it's scary, it's nightmarish, it's police state.
[01:13:12.688 --> 01:13:14.328]  It's got so many levels.
[01:13:14.428 --> 01:13:17.169]  I think this is unlike any film that's ever been made, Rick.
[01:13:17.349 --> 01:13:21.070]  And by the way, I've been saying that, you know, since I first saw the completed thing a few months ago.
[01:13:21.450 --> 01:13:23.890]  Now it's good to see that the critics are saying that.
[01:13:24.431 --> 01:13:25.891]  So this isn't just hype, folks.
[01:13:26.891 --> 01:13:29.051]  I mean, I know I'm going on and on, Rick, but can you comment on that?
[01:13:30.772 --> 01:13:35.813]  Well, you know, I gotta say, it's fun to be making a movie that, you know, yeah,
[01:13:37.495 --> 01:13:39.055]  We didn't really have a roadmap.
[01:13:39.316 --> 01:13:40.816]  There wasn't any precedent for us.
[01:13:40.996 --> 01:13:46.598]  That's why it took a long time when you're doing something that kind of fundamentally, technically hasn't been done before.
[01:13:46.678 --> 01:13:48.978]  But it definitely felt like we got away with something.
[01:13:49.819 --> 01:13:59.622]  Like I said earlier, I owe it to the cast and everybody who came in and worked for well below, you know, for nothing just to kind of come aboard this project.
[01:13:59.802 --> 01:14:00.702]  But that's, you know,
[01:14:01.812 --> 01:14:14.155]  It's how anything in this world, you know, once you take away profit motive and everyone wants to do something just to express themselves and make something happen, you know, in opposition to what the bigger world even wants to be out there.
[01:14:14.175 --> 01:14:18.316]  So we definitely felt like we got away with something.
[01:14:18.476 --> 01:14:23.977]  Just to even be able to put this out there in the world felt like a triumph of some kind.
[01:14:24.017 --> 01:14:29.999]  But, you know, just like within the movie itself, there's this kind of very subtle resistance going on.
[01:14:31.007 --> 01:14:32.208]  You know, beneath the surface.
[01:14:33.168 --> 01:14:35.450]  You know, in a way, you feel that way yourself.
[01:14:35.470 --> 01:14:39.853]  You're sort of commenting on the current climate and what's going on in the world.
[01:14:39.913 --> 01:14:43.615]  In your own way, you know, you have to fight against it, you know.
[01:14:44.716 --> 01:14:46.697]  Well, and then there's the atmosphere of the set.
[01:14:46.817 --> 01:14:56.203]  I mean, you've got all these people walking around, all these famous people, and they're reading 1984 and passing along Alex Jones 9-11 videos.
[01:14:56.283 --> 01:14:58.244]  It was quite an atmosphere.
[01:14:59.425 --> 01:15:00.006]  That's right, Alex.
[01:15:01.135 --> 01:15:03.116]  You've been giving out your video to everybody.
[01:15:03.136 --> 01:15:05.578]  It informed everything we were doing.
[01:15:05.598 --> 01:15:10.160]  It was definitely the world we were living in.
[01:15:11.561 --> 01:15:15.964]  When I was writing this, I was in L.A.
[01:15:16.004 --> 01:15:17.765]  for a couple of days with a rented car.
[01:15:18.625 --> 01:15:27.230]  When I was doing the adaptation, not sure how you have your own doubts about, well, how is this movie going to work?
[01:15:28.846 --> 01:15:31.329]  And it was like, you know, one in the morning, not a car on the road.
[01:15:31.349 --> 01:15:33.270]  I kind of go through a yellow light.
[01:15:33.290 --> 01:15:35.152]  A little flash goes off.
[01:15:35.212 --> 01:15:36.954]  I said, huh, is that one of those insured-ups?
[01:15:36.994 --> 01:15:42.700]  Like a week later, I get a picture of myself, my license plate.
[01:15:42.720 --> 01:15:44.501]  They track me down through the rental car agency.
[01:15:44.521 --> 01:15:46.623]  I never talk to another human, but I get a ticket for like $265.
[01:15:49.730 --> 01:15:52.815]  You know, like I never, you know, that was just crazy.
[01:15:52.875 --> 01:15:56.120]  I was like, oh my God, you know, I heard Philip K. Dick just laughing at me.
[01:15:56.981 --> 01:15:59.746]  You know, like, okay, I never even, but, and the ticket's so expensive.
[01:15:59.766 --> 01:16:04.874]  You do a little research and you found the company that puts those, that technology in place and, and they're,
[01:16:05.413 --> 01:16:06.253]  Top Intersections.
[01:16:06.794 --> 01:16:08.514]  They're getting a cut of every ticket.
[01:16:08.814 --> 01:16:10.955]  And by the way, a lot of those are run by Lockheed Martin.
[01:16:11.255 --> 01:16:11.695]  Yeah, sure.
[01:16:11.715 --> 01:16:14.456]  So we have a defense contractor giving American citizens tickets.
[01:16:14.776 --> 01:16:16.437]  Yeah, sure, why not?
[01:16:16.477 --> 01:16:20.959]  You know, there's a lot of campaign contributions there.
[01:16:21.359 --> 01:16:22.659]  But I mean, what's the next step?
[01:16:22.959 --> 01:16:27.601]  You know, you cross the street at night, you know.
[01:16:28.388 --> 01:16:30.670]  And you get a ticket for jaywalking?
[01:16:30.790 --> 01:16:33.171]  Because biometrically they can read who you are?
[01:16:33.292 --> 01:16:38.295]  Actually, the feds have now paid for all over the country to put face scanning software into the cameras, hooked into them.
[01:16:38.375 --> 01:16:39.096]  Sure.
[01:16:39.336 --> 01:16:46.341]  And now Texas, in the legislature, they've reintroduced the bill to put a transponder in all inspection stickers to turn all the major roads into toll roads.
[01:16:47.611 --> 01:16:55.681]  Yeah, I mean, this is crazy, and it's funny how, like, Philip K. Dick could imagine some of this stuff 30 years ago, and he was a crackpot.
[01:16:55.781 --> 01:17:00.387]  He was a paranoid conspiracy person from the margins to be laughed at.
[01:17:00.608 --> 01:17:04.192]  That, plus a generation, equals reality.
[01:17:04.472 --> 01:17:05.514]  It's the world we're living in.
[01:17:06.164 --> 01:17:07.085]  So, I don't know.
[01:17:07.605 --> 01:17:13.310]  I mean, in many respects, this film is now, as you said, but some of the facets are seven years in the future.
[01:17:13.330 --> 01:17:15.952]  Plus, there's another aspect of problem-reaction-solution.
[01:17:16.372 --> 01:17:18.374]  Who's behind the drug war?
[01:17:18.434 --> 01:17:20.215]  Who's generating this?
[01:17:20.295 --> 01:17:21.796]  Who really stands to gain?
[01:17:21.816 --> 01:17:25.559]  And I don't want to give that away, but this film has quite a few twists, doesn't it?
[01:17:26.220 --> 01:17:26.460]  Yeah.
[01:17:26.720 --> 01:17:28.902]  I mean, it's always, who's behind everything?
[01:17:29.222 --> 01:17:30.363]  You know, you just look at
[01:17:31.374 --> 01:17:33.756]  I mean, everything in our culture, you know?
[01:17:34.016 --> 01:17:44.504]  Well, shifting gears to what's happening right now, your take on the war on terror, the Iraq, Iran, the NSA surveillance, Bush saying he's above the law, Rick?
[01:17:45.505 --> 01:17:48.908]  Oh, it's the most extreme I've ever seen in my lifetime.
[01:17:48.948 --> 01:17:57.934]  I think, well, ever, obviously, in American history, this kind of executive branch grab of power is so unprecedented, you know?
[01:17:59.767 --> 01:18:05.869]  I mean, it's frightening to such an extreme that it... I don't know.
[01:18:05.949 --> 01:18:10.330]  I mean, I see a certain schizophrenia in our population right now.
[01:18:10.350 --> 01:18:13.611]  It's so extreme that people don't even know what to do.
[01:18:14.011 --> 01:18:15.292]  You know, like, how do you comment?
[01:18:15.332 --> 01:18:22.594]  How do you... You know, we're slowly being boiled, you know, to death like that proverbial crab.
[01:18:22.674 --> 01:18:24.275]  You know, it's like, well, what do you do?
[01:18:24.355 --> 01:18:25.615]  What's the outlet for this?
[01:18:25.855 --> 01:18:27.876]  You know, how do you voice your opposition?
[01:18:27.956 --> 01:18:28.316]  How do you...
[01:18:29.542 --> 01:18:30.862]  How do we reel in our government?
[01:18:30.962 --> 01:18:31.422]  I don't know, man.
[01:18:31.542 --> 01:18:32.923]  I think that's what you've done, Rick.
[01:18:32.983 --> 01:18:36.903]  I mean, would you say this film is, at least to some extent, a political statement?
[01:18:37.623 --> 01:18:38.364]  Yeah, of course.
[01:18:38.524 --> 01:18:41.504]  I mean, there's that in it, for sure.
[01:18:41.984 --> 01:18:43.084]  Rick Linklater, stay there.
[01:18:43.344 --> 01:18:44.105]  We've got a break.
[01:18:44.225 --> 01:18:50.146]  We'll be right back with the award-winning director, my good personal friend, and a visionary on the other side.
[01:18:55.487 --> 01:18:57.767]  Do you know the truth about breast cancer?
[01:18:58.809 --> 01:19:01.650]  Do you realize that the race for the cure is over?
[01:19:03.170 --> 01:19:12.813]  The best-kept secret in the world today is that now it is possible to kill cancer without personal suffering, mutilation, and poisoning of your entire system.
[01:19:13.753 --> 01:19:18.915]  Now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaysMedInc's patented methodology.
[01:19:19.702 --> 01:19:30.528]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation, we can destroy skin cancer and breast tumors of any size without adverse side effects at a physician's office.
[01:19:31.168 --> 01:19:33.649]  Star War technology at its best.

[01:20:47.324 --> 01:20:56.168]  The War on Terrorism.
[01:20:56.508 --> 01:20:59.289]  Will it be fought overseas, or will it affect us here at home?
[01:20:59.549 --> 01:21:03.711]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[01:21:04.131 --> 01:21:04.972]  So what do you do?
[01:21:05.292 --> 01:21:09.854]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[01:21:10.339 --> 01:21:12.459]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[01:21:12.939 --> 01:21:27.642]  Sheltering in Place, Surviving Acts of Terrorism from Biological, Chemical, and Radioactive Fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.

[01:22:27.648 --> 01:22:28.048]  I don't know.
[01:23:03.141 --> 01:23:08.983]  Hey, Scanner Darkly in theaters in major cities in the United States, expanding out nationwide the next few weeks.
[01:23:09.043 --> 01:23:10.283]  Be sure to get out there and support it.
[01:23:10.724 --> 01:23:14.365]  Tell everybody about it, because true filmmaking needs to be supported.
[01:23:14.745 --> 01:23:15.705]  But I feel vindicated.
[01:23:15.725 --> 01:23:20.506]  I wrote all these lavish reviews about the film, which I didn't do on Waking Life, which I thought was a great film.
[01:23:20.526 --> 01:23:21.927]  This one really got me impassioned.
[01:23:22.647 --> 01:23:26.889]  And now I see a lot of the big, you know, Chicago Tribune reviews, and it's saying basically what I've said.
[01:23:27.269 --> 01:23:29.070]  This is avant-garde.
[01:23:29.350 --> 01:23:30.491]  This is something before its time.
[01:23:30.511 --> 01:23:32.071]  This is something totally new.
[01:23:32.592 --> 01:23:33.892]  And folks, you know I don't hype stuff.
[01:23:33.912 --> 01:23:35.073]  I mean, I speak from the heart.
[01:23:35.133 --> 01:23:36.833]  This film is incredible.
[01:23:36.873 --> 01:23:37.854]  It's a challenge, too.
[01:23:38.274 --> 01:23:39.294]  I mean, and that's good.
[01:23:39.354 --> 01:23:43.736]  I hate going to action movies where you feel like you just ate a McDonald's cheeseburger when you leave.
[01:23:43.776 --> 01:23:47.938]  It's like, it was okay when you were watching it, but afterwards, you feel like you've had your soul sucked.
[01:23:48.398 --> 01:23:51.180]  Rick, I'm kind of babbling here, but you get the point I'm making?
[01:23:52.140 --> 01:23:52.861]  Well, that's true.
[01:23:52.981 --> 01:23:54.923]  I mean, I feel that way quite often.
[01:23:54.943 --> 01:24:02.230]  I mean, everybody sort of likes a popcorn movie, but if it's... by the time you get to the parking lot, if it's already out of your brain, that should tell you something.
[01:24:03.171 --> 01:24:04.352]  I don't know if it is out of your brain.
[01:24:04.392 --> 01:24:05.694]  I think it's... No, you're right.
[01:24:05.734 --> 01:24:07.616]  You just crystallized my long statement.
[01:24:07.976 --> 01:24:09.017]  That's exactly what I mean.
[01:24:09.698 --> 01:24:10.098]  Yeah.
[01:24:10.258 --> 01:24:14.783]  So, I mean, Scanner definitely... I mean, it's the kind of movie that makes you want to...
[01:24:15.365 --> 01:24:18.086]  You realize, oh, if I watch it again, I'll understand even more.
[01:24:18.106 --> 01:24:25.250]  There's a lot of layers and things you would only understand fully on a second time, but hopefully you're intrigued enough the first time.
[01:24:25.410 --> 01:24:27.051]  Well, that was the same thing with Waking Life.
[01:24:27.091 --> 01:24:28.292]  The first time I saw it, I liked it.
[01:24:28.312 --> 01:24:29.432]  The second time, I loved it.
[01:24:29.712 --> 01:24:31.333]  The third time, I liked it even more.
[01:24:31.353 --> 01:24:33.594]  And now that's become a cult classic.
[01:24:33.654 --> 01:24:35.495]  It's somewhat evergreen.
[01:24:36.296 --> 01:24:36.656]  Yeah.
[01:24:37.757 --> 01:24:40.278]  I mean, I've always kind of had that experience.
[01:24:40.338 --> 01:24:43.079]  If you're really honest with yourself and you do something
[01:24:45.399 --> 01:24:46.639]  It's unbelievable.
[01:24:46.659 --> 01:24:50.841]  I don't want to get into my little role in the film and little places where I pop up in the film.
[01:24:50.861 --> 01:24:51.901]  It's important though.
[01:25:14.708 --> 01:25:21.530]  You know, you're one scene that we worked up that's not part of the book, per se, but it's of the material.
[01:25:21.570 --> 01:25:22.890]  It's really important, I think.
[01:25:24.071 --> 01:25:31.873]  Your character is standing on a, you know, in a parking lot, kind of, you know, with a call to arms, sort of.
[01:25:32.373 --> 01:25:33.233]  What happens to you?
[01:25:33.353 --> 01:25:34.553]  You can, you can, I don't know.
[01:25:35.254 --> 01:25:36.654]  It's not really giving anything away, is it?
[01:25:37.230 --> 01:25:40.232]  No, in fact, let's just play a short clip of that audio.
[01:25:40.292 --> 01:25:42.353]  Go ahead and... This is a fun thing to work on, too.
[01:25:42.893 --> 01:25:44.334]  We're just gonna roll a few seconds of it.
[01:25:44.354 --> 01:25:44.934]  Go ahead and roll it.
[01:25:44.974 --> 01:25:45.254]  Yeah.
[01:25:46.035 --> 01:25:47.295]  The Substance D clip, guys.
[01:25:47.355 --> 01:25:49.476]  Where did Substance D come from?
[01:25:49.756 --> 01:25:50.917]  Why can't we stop it?
[01:25:51.317 --> 01:25:56.820]  The bigger this war gets, the more freedoms we lose, the more Substance D is on our streets!
[01:25:57.400 --> 01:25:58.661]  Can't you figure this out?
[01:26:01.603 --> 01:26:06.205]  And, of course, I don't end up in too good a shape in the film either, do I, Rick?
[01:26:07.565 --> 01:26:10.729]  No, the little van pulls up and you get carted off.
[01:26:11.669 --> 01:26:15.253]  Well, I'll tell you, there are several big twists at the end of the film.
[01:26:15.353 --> 01:26:18.296]  Everybody needs to get out there and see it.
[01:26:19.677 --> 01:26:24.782]  Do you think that the film is going to be seen as a political statement by the media, by the critics?
[01:26:27.233 --> 01:26:37.208]  Yeah, I mean, well, I think on one level it's seen as a story and, you know, people laugh and are entertained, but I think on another level they really can't help but be seen as a social critique.
[01:26:38.190 --> 01:26:40.033]  You know, it's just too much.
[01:26:40.686 --> 01:26:42.147]  Tommy invited me out to the L.A.
[01:26:42.167 --> 01:26:44.168]  premiere but I couldn't make it.
[01:26:44.248 --> 01:26:50.571]  The only reason I wanted to go was to find out what the actors thought of it when they finally saw it.
[01:26:50.611 --> 01:26:51.971]  What was their view on it?
[01:27:06.078 --> 01:27:07.539]  Keeps finding more stuff in it.
[01:27:07.559 --> 01:27:10.882]  So they're all very, you know, very much behind the film, which is flattering.
[01:27:10.922 --> 01:27:13.564]  You know, some actors don't really get behind the film.
[01:27:14.024 --> 01:27:22.811]  Well, that's really what I found talking to people all over Austin who've seen it, is that everybody is drawn to something different in the film because it has so many layers.
[01:27:23.812 --> 01:27:26.294]  Yeah, well, that's great.
[01:27:26.314 --> 01:27:30.397]  I mean, no one could be closer to this movie than me, having worked on it for so long.
[01:27:30.798 --> 01:27:33.680]  And yet I still I see it and still get things out of it.
[01:27:34.418 --> 01:27:36.698]  That I can only attribute to Philip K. Dix.
[01:27:37.559 --> 01:27:42.520]  Like, strong, you know, deep, metaphorical ideas.
[01:27:42.960 --> 01:27:44.600]  You know, just the notion of identity.
[01:27:45.860 --> 01:27:47.321]  And, you know, privacy.
[01:27:47.381 --> 01:27:54.662]  Everything about, you know, their core, their deep ideas, you know, that kind of resonate.
[01:27:55.002 --> 01:28:01.423]  Well, he's the most adapted sci-fi writer into film, and his family on their own website says they haven't liked many of the films.
[01:28:01.784 --> 01:28:03.704]  They are really ecstatic about this.
[01:28:04.420 --> 01:28:15.650]  Well, yeah, I mean, that was our goal, to be very faithful to his story, not just to grab a few of his great ideas and make an action thriller about it, which you can do and has been done.
[01:28:15.670 --> 01:28:29.262]  I really wanted to tell this story from A to Z, you know, it's adapted from the 70s to now, set in the near future, but it is that story, Scanner Darkly, so we were striving for a
[01:28:30.009 --> 01:28:32.470]  Authentic, you know, adaptation.
[01:28:32.490 --> 01:28:33.810]  Because he's a great novelist.
[01:28:33.890 --> 01:28:36.011]  I mean, he deserves to have his stories told.
[01:28:36.231 --> 01:28:38.471]  Final segment with Richard Linklater on the other side.
[01:28:44.093 --> 01:28:44.993]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.493 --> 01:28:47.074]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.094 --> 01:28:50.695]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:54.113 --> 01:28:58.514]  Local folklore has recognized its amazing medicinal properties for thousands of years.
[01:28:58.694 --> 01:29:04.376]  But no one knew just how to preserve the nutritional benefits and market the total fruit commercially until Zango, that is.
[01:29:04.736 --> 01:29:09.677]  Zango is made from mangosteen, a fruit that grows in the subtropical climates of Southeast Asia.
[01:29:09.897 --> 01:29:14.419]  It contains xanthomes, the highest concentration of antioxidants found in nature.
[01:29:14.699 --> 01:29:20.980]  Modern science is only just beginning to unlock the many secrets of xanthomes and their far-reaching potential to improve our health.
[01:29:21.281 --> 01:29:22.761]  Zango is revolutionary.
[01:29:23.021 --> 01:29:33.049]  Not only has Zango taken the world by storm as an extremely potent functional health beverage, but Zango has become the most exciting and fastest-growing home-based business opportunity ever.
[01:29:33.329 --> 01:29:35.531]  Life is short, and timing is everything.
[01:29:35.831 --> 01:29:37.453]  Unleash the power of Zango today!

[01:29:54.218 --> 01:29:57.803]  Do you know where the 78 potentially active volcanoes in the U.S.
[01:29:57.843 --> 01:29:58.343]  are located?
[01:29:58.544 --> 01:30:01.948]  And do you know the locations of the top 300 prime terrorist targets?
[01:30:02.168 --> 01:30:06.874]  You can find these answers and more in the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA.

[01:30:30.993 --> 01:30:31.233]  I think so.
[01:30:55.257 --> 01:31:01.621]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[01:31:02.002 --> 01:31:06.665]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife Frequency technology.
[01:31:07.005 --> 01:31:14.530]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms could be destroyed using resonant frequency.
[01:31:14.990 --> 01:31:21.852]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:31:22.072 --> 01:31:23.453]  There are no side effects.
[01:31:23.773 --> 01:31:27.434]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.

[01:32:04.253 --> 01:32:06.134]  And that's what A Scanner Darkly is about.
[01:32:06.866 --> 01:32:09.488]  To a great extent, is a war on for the mind.
[01:32:10.269 --> 01:32:11.750]  What's behind Substance D?
[01:32:11.910 --> 01:32:18.056]  In fact, Rick Linkletter in the Chronicle here locally in Austin
[01:32:18.812 --> 01:32:19.873]  Had a quote about that.
[01:32:20.833 --> 01:32:29.079]  Kay Dick imagined with this drug war and the blending of that and this war on terror are two twin unwinnable wars that we've got now.
[01:32:29.179 --> 01:32:40.367]  You know, they're just going to go on indefinitely and Dick saw pretty clearly how that wasn't going to help any citizens and instead was just another form of control under the guise of helping people.
[01:32:40.787 --> 01:32:46.951]  And he's got another quote in here about how this drug basically turns people into slaves to the state or zombies.
[01:32:48.633 --> 01:32:55.824]  That's really the point that Dick makes in the book is about how his friends were basically just like children having fun playing in the street who got hurt.
[01:32:56.445 --> 01:33:03.655]  The bigger the drug war gets, the more people we have in prison, the more drugs are on our streets, the bigger the police state expands.
[01:33:04.956 --> 01:33:07.977]  And really these are people who are just addicted to substances.
[01:33:08.337 --> 01:33:11.597]  You talked in another interview about drugs.
[01:33:11.657 --> 01:33:15.458]  Somebody who you'll know for years and you don't even know is on drugs and suddenly they die.
[01:33:15.818 --> 01:33:18.098]  Oh yeah, he was on heroin, he was on cocaine.
[01:33:18.118 --> 01:33:25.360]  Can you speak to the sense of loss and really in a way this is kind of an autobiography of Philip K. Dick and things that happened to his friends.
[01:33:26.100 --> 01:33:28.080]  Yeah, it was very, very personal to him.
[01:33:29.280 --> 01:33:32.241]  Philip K. Dick had a problem with methamphetamines.
[01:33:32.645 --> 01:33:44.252]  Primarily prescription drugs, you know, and this is kind of an honor of all the people he lost along the way.
[01:33:44.272 --> 01:33:52.456]  The book and the movie end with a memoriam with a list of people, you know, casualties.
[01:33:52.516 --> 01:33:53.977]  He put himself on the list, too.
[01:33:55.058 --> 01:33:59.320]  So, I think he saw how he was a casualty himself.
[01:33:59.340 --> 01:34:00.060]  You know, he died at 53.
[01:34:01.758 --> 01:34:08.941]  You know, so we were denied, you know, several decades of more Philip K. Dick work because of that.
[01:34:09.441 --> 01:34:12.442]  And his point was, these people weren't bad people.
[01:34:12.842 --> 01:34:14.243]  They never really harmed anyone.
[01:34:15.023 --> 01:34:16.624]  They just got in over their head.
[01:34:17.724 --> 01:34:19.185]  And, you know, it's sad.
[01:34:20.645 --> 01:34:21.325]  It's really sad.
[01:34:21.365 --> 01:34:24.967]  And I think everyone working on this film, we all had our own list.
[01:34:24.987 --> 01:34:26.587]  You know, we honored Philip K. Dick's list.
[01:34:27.428 --> 01:34:30.389]  But I think everybody, you get older, you have your own list of people
[01:34:31.300 --> 01:34:36.745]  You know, you've lost friends who, and often they're the most vibrant, alive, intelligent people you'll ever meet, too.
[01:34:36.765 --> 01:34:45.071]  It's very sad that they're responding in a way that is not healthy for them personally.
[01:34:45.091 --> 01:34:49.955]  I've personally lost several old friends this year, or in the last year, from drugs.
[01:34:50.896 --> 01:34:57.281]  Yeah, and it's not just drugs, it's alcohol, it's other behaviors that are, you know, that are risky.
[01:35:00.362 --> 01:35:05.204]  I mean, there's all kinds of things we're all doing all the time that are dangerous.
[01:35:05.504 --> 01:35:05.925]  Exactly.
[01:35:05.965 --> 01:35:07.645]  George Clooney was one of the producers on this.
[01:35:07.685 --> 01:35:08.526]  Is he happy with the film?
[01:35:10.167 --> 01:35:23.873]  You know, he and Stephen, their company, Section 8, within Warner Brothers, they optioned the book for me five years ago or whatever and did me a big solid there, but they're very busy with what they're doing, George and Stephen, so I haven't really talked to them too much.
[01:35:24.473 --> 01:35:26.054]  They saw the film, but I think they're laying back.
[01:35:28.952 --> 01:35:33.374]  Their profile, I think they didn't want to overshadow or be too up front and center about it all.
[01:35:33.414 --> 01:35:35.155]  But, you know, they definitely had a crucial time.
[01:35:35.575 --> 01:35:36.956]  Well, it's already so political.
[01:35:36.996 --> 01:35:38.756]  Do you think George Bush will watch this film?
[01:35:38.796 --> 01:35:42.158]  And if he does, what will he take away from it?
[01:35:42.478 --> 01:35:44.239]  No, he will never watch this film.
[01:35:44.839 --> 01:35:47.800]  And even if he did, I don't think he'd take away much from it.
[01:35:48.661 --> 01:35:51.582]  Hey, maybe he'll invite you to the White House.
[01:35:51.602 --> 01:35:52.502]  You can show it to him there.
[01:35:52.662 --> 01:35:53.363]  No, I'm offended.
[01:35:53.423 --> 01:35:56.044]  I know he does invite some films to the White House and they watch them.
[01:35:57.161 --> 01:35:58.742]  Yeah, I'm surprised this one isn't there.
[01:35:58.902 --> 01:36:01.684]  Would you go to the White House and sit on the couch next to our Fuhrer?
[01:36:03.325 --> 01:36:04.105]  Absolutely not.
[01:36:04.145 --> 01:36:07.727]  You know, I've been... I've actually met George Bush before when he was governor.
[01:36:07.747 --> 01:36:10.309]  You know, sometimes it's a small town there in Austin.
[01:36:10.329 --> 01:36:11.229]  I was at some function.
[01:36:12.350 --> 01:36:16.352]  And, you know, he's like... He's kind of what they say.
[01:36:16.372 --> 01:36:17.433]  He's like a good old boy.
[01:36:17.453 --> 01:36:20.835]  Sort of that Yale-y, you know, frat boy kind of thing.
[01:36:20.855 --> 01:36:24.217]  You know, but, uh... Man.
[01:36:24.875 --> 01:36:27.476]  Is he in over his head as President of the whole United States?
[01:36:27.496 --> 01:36:36.520]  It's sort of the worst, you know, your worst combination of someone not prepared with their impulses being almost wrong every time.
[01:36:36.540 --> 01:36:39.821]  It's painful to watch as a Texan, especially.
[01:36:40.182 --> 01:36:40.422]  It is.
[01:36:40.462 --> 01:36:47.205]  I want to play the trailer and then just for a few minutes talk about another big movie you've got coming out this year, and that's Fast Food Nation.
[01:36:47.245 --> 01:36:52.307]  But first, let's go ahead and roll the extended trailer from the Scanner Darkly movie website.
[01:36:52.347 --> 01:36:52.667]  Here it is.
[01:36:54.179 --> 01:36:55.880]  It may just be my imagination.
[01:36:58.361 --> 01:37:06.665]  Whatever it is that's watching... It's not human.
[01:37:06.765 --> 01:37:12.448]  Gentlemen, you are about to witness for approximately 61 cents the perfect homemade silencer.
[01:37:20.160 --> 01:37:28.264]  Just drive over to my place, kick back, get some tequila.
[01:37:28.585 --> 01:37:32.047]  They're in my hair, on my skin.
[01:37:32.327 --> 01:37:35.048]  They're all over the place.
[01:37:35.068 --> 01:37:37.409]  This is a world getting progressively worse.
[01:37:37.429 --> 01:37:38.230]  Can you not agree on that?
[01:37:41.184 --> 01:37:46.667]  Damage has taken place to the normally dominant left hemisphere and the right hemisphere is attempting to compensate.
[01:37:46.967 --> 01:37:50.248]  Two hemispheres of my brain are competing?
[01:37:50.668 --> 01:37:50.989]  Yes.
[01:37:54.890 --> 01:37:56.791]  I could be murdered.
[01:37:57.191 --> 01:37:59.352]  How did I get here?
[01:38:00.373 --> 01:38:04.575]  I tip my hat to any entity that could bring so much integrity to evil.
[01:38:08.326 --> 01:38:13.629]  What if they come in through the back door or the bathroom window like that infamous Beatles song?
[01:38:14.149 --> 01:38:19.652]  Just sacrifice someone without them ever knowing it.
[01:38:20.693 --> 01:38:22.234]  What does the scanner see?
[01:38:24.275 --> 01:38:24.935]  Into the head?
[01:38:24.955 --> 01:38:28.437]  Into the heart?
[01:38:33.320 --> 01:38:34.380]  Does it see into me?
[01:38:36.491 --> 01:38:36.912]  Clearly.
[01:38:39.236 --> 01:38:39.797]  Or darkly.
[01:38:39.878 --> 01:38:42.983]  Just awe-inspiring to see.
[01:38:47.888 --> 01:38:50.769]  A Scanner Darkly in theaters in select cities around the country.
[01:38:51.089 --> 01:38:54.750]  Rick, I know you're not involved in a lot of the rollout of it.
[01:38:55.271 --> 01:39:08.295]  You're just involved in making, producing, and promoting it, but this is a platform release, I guess, where they use the select release to then get all the media attention and then expand from there, but how long until this is in every major city in the U.S.?
[01:39:08.915 --> 01:39:09.655]  You know, I'm not sure.
[01:39:09.675 --> 01:39:15.657]  I think it depends on how it does, but yeah, I think over the next three weeks it'll go out.
[01:39:15.697 --> 01:39:17.098]  It's just, that's one way you
[01:39:18.420 --> 01:39:19.661]  I don't think so.
[01:39:37.070 --> 01:39:40.594]  You need word of mouth for people to talk about seriously like that.
[01:39:40.994 --> 01:39:47.180]  Rick, I want to briefly talk about Fast Food Nation and the response that both these films got at the Cannes Film Festival.
[01:39:47.461 --> 01:39:50.183]  But before we do that and close up this interview, I know you're a busy man.
[01:39:50.844 --> 01:39:52.686]  Any other key points you want to make about the film?
[01:39:53.727 --> 01:39:54.107]  Oh, gosh.
[01:39:56.192 --> 01:40:00.173]  You know, I mean, I think the films, it's both very funny and tragic.
[01:40:00.193 --> 01:40:03.734]  You know, we talk about the tragic elements, but there's, you know, there's a lot going on in it.
[01:40:03.894 --> 01:40:10.276]  So, I mean, that was, to me, the biggest challenge was to make it both a full-blown comedy and a full-blown tragedy.
[01:40:10.516 --> 01:40:21.780]  You know, that those two aspects of life are often very close together, you know, but you don't really see it in films a lot because it's, you know, just seems like too complex or, you know, most stories that are
[01:40:22.848 --> 01:40:25.651]  Made for consumption, can't really encompass those two things.
[01:40:25.751 --> 01:40:28.593]  But it's also got a big whodunit mystery element, too.
[01:40:28.974 --> 01:40:31.436]  Because you've got the scramble suit, can you describe that for us?
[01:40:31.796 --> 01:40:33.318]  Oh my gosh, the scramble suit.
[01:40:34.058 --> 01:40:36.621]  Yeah, I mean that's sort of the central metaphor of the movie, I think.
[01:40:37.061 --> 01:40:48.131]  As an undercover narcotics agent, he's wearing this kind of fin-like membrane shroud that's projecting images of other people, you know, millions of other people at all times.
[01:40:49.011 --> 01:40:51.972]  He's sort of this everyman, hidden underneath that.
[01:40:52.032 --> 01:40:54.352]  So it's a lot about identity and role-playing.
[01:40:54.892 --> 01:41:02.974]  At that point, he's an undercover narcotics officer in this future drug war where it's gotten so bad that they need to hide their identities.
[01:41:03.954 --> 01:41:15.656]  But it's kind of, I mean, it's absurdist, kind of Philip K. Dick notion, you know, and it probably would look pretty goofy live action, but within our kind of graphic novel come to life style, it's sort of,
[01:41:16.644 --> 01:41:18.386]  It sort of works as a whole, I think.
[01:41:18.486 --> 01:41:21.408]  It's funny, I think.
[01:41:21.508 --> 01:41:26.233]  Well, in the film, you also have to have it because of all the face scanning and biometric cameras everywhere.
[01:41:26.353 --> 01:41:37.342]  And did you know, Rick, I think during the production we talked about this, but the military is now coming out with chameleon suits for tanks and soldiers, and they really have something similar to the scramble suit now.
[01:41:37.502 --> 01:41:38.684]  Yeah, I'm not surprised.
[01:41:40.015 --> 01:41:42.896]  It's like so many things Philip K. Dick imagined.
[01:41:43.396 --> 01:41:45.757]  It's just kind of right in the future somewhere.
[01:41:45.917 --> 01:41:47.198]  You know, it's not out of nowhere.
[01:41:47.238 --> 01:41:54.680]  He thought very kind of logically, you know, like what would be an item you could use for various reasons.
[01:41:54.720 --> 01:41:57.781]  So it's all pretty close to reality.
[01:41:57.801 --> 01:42:04.124]  And even though I think we're technically called a science fiction movie, our whole take is, well, we're living in science fiction right now.
[01:42:04.324 --> 01:42:07.425]  If you could go back a generation, I mean, right now is science fiction.
[01:42:08.620 --> 01:42:10.421]  Well, we know the critics like the film.
[01:42:10.441 --> 01:42:13.883]  Again, I found one negative out of about 30-40 I read just Sunday night.
[01:42:13.903 --> 01:42:14.744]  I read some more this morning.
[01:42:14.764 --> 01:42:16.005]  They were all positive, some new ones.
[01:42:16.505 --> 01:42:20.487]  But when you were at Cannes Film Festival, you know, there was a foreign crowd.
[01:42:20.507 --> 01:42:24.210]  I don't mean a lot of American, but I mean, what was the foreign response to it?
[01:42:25.911 --> 01:42:26.351]  Pretty good.
[01:42:26.391 --> 01:42:30.293]  I found myself, as one of the few American filmmakers over there, defending my country.
[01:42:30.313 --> 01:42:34.836]  Because I had two films that can be seen as pretty critical in various ways.
[01:42:35.552 --> 01:42:37.633]  of our government, our culture at this moment.
[01:42:37.673 --> 01:42:39.334]  Fast Food Nation being the other movie.
[01:42:39.354 --> 01:42:44.497]  I mean, Scanner took so long to finish in the animation, I was able to make that movie in the meantime.
[01:42:45.218 --> 01:42:51.121]  But I found myself kind of defending the United States, saying, hey, we didn't, you know, we're not the only country.
[01:42:51.161 --> 01:42:51.801]  Look at England.
[01:42:51.821 --> 01:42:53.522]  They're more under surveillance than we are.
[01:42:53.642 --> 01:42:57.925]  You know, this is just how power acts in relation to its citizens.
[01:42:59.051 --> 01:43:09.274]  And how, you know, corporations grab control and, you know, how people are treated like data or consumers and, you know, so America, you know, we do not have the sole possession of that.
[01:43:09.854 --> 01:43:13.015]  Well, Rick, I mean, I criticize my government, but it's not my country.
[01:43:13.055 --> 01:43:15.196]  I do what I do because I love the United States.
[01:43:15.216 --> 01:43:21.838]  You're a fellow Texan and, you know, Bush isn't even really a real Texan and so, I mean, I think that's the important point here.
[01:43:22.118 --> 01:43:24.479]  We're exposing the bad things in this country because we love it.
[01:43:27.901 --> 01:43:28.922]  I mean, do you agree with that statement?
[01:43:28.942 --> 01:43:30.062]  I mean, is that where you're coming from?
[01:43:30.122 --> 01:43:32.743]  Is that we're trying to show the bad so we can get rid of it?
[01:43:36.204 --> 01:43:37.185]  Did we lose his phone?
[01:43:40.046 --> 01:43:40.226]  Yeah.
[01:43:40.946 --> 01:43:43.227]  Yeah, he's probably on a cordless or something and it dropped out.
[01:43:43.407 --> 01:43:44.588]  Call him, we'll finish the interview up.
[01:43:45.608 --> 01:43:47.269]  I heard him try to respond and it dropped out.
[01:43:48.149 --> 01:43:50.570]  Yeah, it's, uh, A Scanner Darkly, folks.
[01:43:50.630 --> 01:43:52.991]  It's an amazing, amazing film.
[01:43:53.749 --> 01:43:58.433]  And you really, really and truly need to see it.
[01:43:59.313 --> 01:44:08.860]  And again, it's got so many facets to it, I can't even really begin to describe how many layers it's got to it.
[01:44:10.001 --> 01:44:10.562]  But when you
[01:44:11.556 --> 01:44:23.768]  When you work on a film, and I did consult a little bit on it too, and then when you actually see it, you know, in the theaters, you see people liking it, because I was trying to ask myself, you know, I love this film, but is that just because I'm in it, and it's police state, and it kind of covers the New World Order?
[01:44:23.788 --> 01:44:27.592]  Am I polluting, you know, my own view of it because I like it?
[01:44:28.212 --> 01:44:36.300]  And then to just see nothing but really good reviews out there, that has been, that has been extremely, extremely exciting.
[01:44:38.510 --> 01:44:40.171]  Why don't you try his cell phone?
[01:44:40.191 --> 01:44:41.571]  I know he's at a friend's house right now.
[01:44:41.591 --> 01:44:43.152]  So you can do it that way.
[01:44:43.952 --> 01:44:45.373]  Did Kevin give you his cell phone number?
[01:44:46.553 --> 01:44:47.014]  Do you have him?
[01:44:49.595 --> 01:44:49.835]  Okay.
[01:44:50.435 --> 01:44:52.156]  Well, I can hear him there breathing.
[01:44:52.176 --> 01:44:53.796]  I think it was some kind of phone line problem.
[01:44:54.096 --> 01:44:56.617]  That happens occasionally when we have really big guests.
[01:44:56.678 --> 01:44:57.558]  Like the time I had
[01:44:59.611 --> 01:45:01.132]  I had Moses on.
[01:45:01.172 --> 01:45:08.194]  I had the guy that played Moses, Mr. NRA himself, Charlton Heston, and we were calling and calling for ten minutes.
[01:45:08.214 --> 01:45:09.415]  He said, oh, my phone wasn't ringing.
[01:45:09.435 --> 01:45:12.215]  He was there waiting for the interview, and of course that happened.
[01:45:12.235 --> 01:45:19.638]  Very mysterious phone things happen, but I tend to think that's Murphy's Law and not the government.
[01:45:20.398 --> 01:45:22.939]  But, okay.
[01:45:23.780 --> 01:45:24.680]  Rick, are you there?
[01:45:25.485 --> 01:45:26.105]  Sorry about it.
[01:45:26.346 --> 01:45:30.288]  You thought I was getting censored or cut off just when I was talking about my country.
[01:45:30.308 --> 01:45:33.770]  Yeah, well, who knows what happened, but sorry to lose you.
[01:45:34.110 --> 01:45:37.592]  The phone I was at, you have the place I'm saying, died or something.
[01:45:37.652 --> 01:45:39.674]  No, that's actually what I first guessed on air.
[01:45:39.694 --> 01:45:41.995]  As I said, it was probably a cordless and died.
[01:45:42.015 --> 01:45:49.399]  And then I said, we've had censorship before, but I doubt that that's what this was.
[01:45:49.619 --> 01:45:53.842]  Well, listen, in closing, Rick, tell us a little bit about, well, I mean, finish up with the question I had.
[01:45:55.820 --> 01:46:07.125]  Oh yeah, I mean, what we were talking... I was over at Ken's, you know, like I said, defending my country, and like, hey, as an American I can make this social critique, but don't doubt for a second, you know.
[01:46:07.145 --> 01:46:10.466]  You know, I love my country, wouldn't want to live anywhere else.
[01:46:10.606 --> 01:46:15.268]  I think they were hoping I would be a little more anti-American, in that sense, a little more polemical.
[01:46:16.128 --> 01:46:17.469]  But I like, ah, I love my country.
[01:46:17.489 --> 01:46:18.629]  You know, great people.
[01:46:19.750 --> 01:46:22.411]  You know, and, you know, great energy, great optimism.
[01:46:23.064 --> 01:46:28.587]  Do you agree with my point that it's because we love this country that we try to expose the bad things that are growing?
[01:46:29.148 --> 01:46:29.668]  Absolutely!
[01:46:29.728 --> 01:46:32.810]  I mean, isn't that our, that's our role, that's our duty.
[01:46:33.290 --> 01:46:36.552]  You know, that's what the Founding Fathers certainly wanted.
[01:46:36.872 --> 01:46:41.975]  A kind of a very robust dialogue where everyone's a little unsatisfied.
[01:46:42.015 --> 01:46:46.438]  What we have now is a small group who are very satisfied.
[01:46:47.142 --> 01:46:50.725]  I mean, they've got way too much, you know, that they've taken total control.
[01:46:50.945 --> 01:46:52.946]  Do you think their hubris will bring them down?
[01:46:53.647 --> 01:47:11.000]  Yeah, I mean, we're in the process of that happening, but I mean, my darker thinking would say, well, but if you own all of the means of control, if you, once you own the media and the outlets and you can kind of control the debate to such a large degree, I wonder if the dissenting voices can even be heard.
[01:47:11.761 --> 01:47:14.803]  You know, when you, when you fiddle with the machinery of elections,
[01:47:15.441 --> 01:47:16.162]  to that degree.
[01:47:29.855 --> 01:47:30.455]  It really is.
[01:47:30.795 --> 01:47:31.775]  It's the end of something.
[01:47:31.955 --> 01:47:33.756]  Well, you're very well politically informed.
[01:47:33.816 --> 01:47:36.096]  I mean, Rick is really up to speed on so many issues.
[01:47:36.116 --> 01:47:40.077]  One of the few people I've talked to in Hollywood who really knows what he's talking about, and I'm sure you're aware of.
[01:47:40.317 --> 01:47:47.159]  They're now indicting people who were hired by the Republicans to jam phone lines during elections so Democrats couldn't get the vote out.
[01:47:47.199 --> 01:47:48.919]  I mean, it's getting wild!
[01:47:49.839 --> 01:47:54.180]  Yeah, well, if you treat government and power like any
[01:47:55.259 --> 01:47:59.541]  Like a sport, which is kind of what they are, by any means necessary.
[01:47:59.721 --> 01:48:08.645]  Once you have no moral base and no faith in the Constitution or anything like that, once you throw that out the window, then yeah, you can win by any means necessary.
[01:48:09.565 --> 01:48:12.386]  You know, but it's scary because both sides aren't playing that way.
[01:48:12.406 --> 01:48:15.828]  I mean, it's a new paradigm, that's for sure.
[01:48:16.068 --> 01:48:16.988]  I agree, a new paradigm.
[01:48:17.028 --> 01:48:21.210]  I mean, I've looked at it, a lot of people have looked at it, and it seems like Bush has dwarfed the crimes of Nixon.
[01:48:22.771 --> 01:48:23.631]  Oh, much worse, yeah.
[01:48:25.017 --> 01:48:26.559]  Nixon's a liberal compared to Bush.
[01:48:26.639 --> 01:48:30.383]  I mean, at least he cared about, like, air quality, drinking water, things like that.
[01:48:31.084 --> 01:48:34.147]  Well, Rick, in closing, I want to thank you for making this film.
[01:48:34.167 --> 01:48:35.368]  I want to thank you for including me in it.
[01:48:35.388 --> 01:48:37.130]  I want to thank you for making a true work of art.
[01:48:37.851 --> 01:48:39.773]  And I want to thank you for your friendship.
[01:48:39.853 --> 01:48:45.039]  It is just wonderful knowing you and knowing that there are great people like you out there that are fighting for this country, Rick.
[01:48:45.879 --> 01:48:48.480]  Well thanks Alex and thanks for being in my movie.
[01:48:48.520 --> 01:48:54.943]  It's a great scene you're in and your spirit was with us always and I enjoy giving out your work to people.
[01:48:56.003 --> 01:49:06.127]  I told you Bruce Willis, I gave him your latest DVD and he said it put him in such a head space and he will be quiet on issues of
[01:49:07.828 --> 01:49:10.189]  National politics.
[01:49:10.309 --> 01:49:15.312]  In fact, didn't you say that, quote, he emailed you back and said it changed his kind of political paradigm?
[01:49:16.132 --> 01:49:17.553]  Yeah, you know, I don't know.
[01:49:17.573 --> 01:49:21.395]  I mean, Bruce, he's a free-thinking, radical kind of guy.
[01:49:21.655 --> 01:49:22.536]  You know, he really is.
[01:49:24.937 --> 01:49:26.658]  Well, Rick, I'm going to let you go.
[01:49:26.738 --> 01:49:31.861]  I really appreciate you spending time with us, and I hope to see you around Austin in the near future, my friend.
[01:49:32.201 --> 01:49:32.981]  Okay, thanks Alex.
[01:49:33.221 --> 01:49:34.142]  Always good talking to you.
[01:49:34.382 --> 01:49:35.182]  Always good talking to you.
[01:49:35.202 --> 01:49:35.723]  Thanks for the time.
[01:49:35.743 --> 01:49:36.063]  God bless.
[01:49:37.142 --> 01:49:41.585]  There goes Rick Linklater, and I know so much behind-the-scenes stuff, I wasn't going to bring that up.
[01:49:41.665 --> 01:49:44.067]  There's a lot of other stuff too, but did you hear that?
[01:49:45.288 --> 01:49:48.370]  It was more to it too, but oh man, that is just incredible.
[01:49:48.830 --> 01:49:52.313]  Well, we'll put a story out on this, you can believe it.
[01:49:54.736 --> 01:50:02.119]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.

[01:50:07.341 --> 01:50:12.983]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[01:50:13.243 --> 01:50:17.767]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[01:50:17.987 --> 01:50:25.153]  The cashless society control grid, implantable microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[01:50:25.173 --> 01:50:25.934]  soil, the U.S.A.

[01:53:06.975 --> 01:53:09.057]  Oh man, we're going to have a great headline with that one.
[01:53:11.618 --> 01:53:14.701]  John gets to hear behind the scenes stuff, like when I was talking to Rick off air.
[01:53:16.042 --> 01:53:18.984]  And I just said, Rick, you want me to get into current politics?
[01:53:19.124 --> 01:53:19.944]  You want me to get into 9-11?
[01:53:19.964 --> 01:53:21.445]  Sure, go ahead, I'll talk about it.
[01:53:22.606 --> 01:53:27.670]  I probably could have got him to even say more about 9-11, but I didn't want to get him in too much trouble.
[01:53:28.573 --> 01:53:50.187]  I think what is it he's given out like he brought it all up I wasn't gonna bring it up I did not ask him to say any of that in fact I never push these guys he's given out like 300 copies or something like that of martial law I mean everybody in Hollywood that he knows he has given copies of martial law to them
[01:53:51.395 --> 01:54:18.043]  and uh... but there is a point about the gave it to bruce willis hand-delivered to members will see the email back-and-forth emailing back in austin because you know but willis is infested nation and uh... said the man is totally changes my paradigm is uh... you know this film i'm gonna watch you know who i stand up for now and we know what i said you know willis has been supporting the neocons and i would never have thought rick would've brought that up but rick did so we're going to put it in an article
[01:54:19.446 --> 01:54:24.070]  And Bush is worse than Nixon, and the police state, and the phony drug war.
[01:54:24.130 --> 01:54:31.196]  That was another Hollywood person going public, speaking out.
[01:54:32.217 --> 01:54:33.278]  Rick's made a lot of big movies.
[01:54:35.420 --> 01:54:42.906]  He's also critically acclaimed for the big Art House productions he's made with so many top actors.
[01:54:44.326 --> 01:54:47.328]  And again, we don't just get Hollywood people on here to talk about Hollywood.
[01:54:47.348 --> 01:54:50.689]  We're getting them on to talk about the New World Order, to talk about what we're doing to fight it.
[01:54:50.729 --> 01:54:51.290]  You heard Rick.
[01:54:52.090 --> 01:54:53.851]  This is how he politically speaks out.
[01:54:54.331 --> 01:54:55.352]  This is the work he does.
[01:54:55.372 --> 01:54:57.893]  This is where he makes his statements.
[01:54:59.694 --> 01:55:01.675]  And he certainly did make those statements.
[01:55:01.735 --> 01:55:04.677]  Now, I've done an hour and 56 minutes of radio today.
[01:55:05.277 --> 01:55:07.818]  Got a whole other hour coming up with Jack McClam and a lot more.
[01:55:10.862 --> 01:55:14.563]  Now it's time to pay the bills, plus it gets the word out and defeats the New World Order.
[01:55:14.603 --> 01:55:18.524]  That's the number one thing, but I have spent a lot of money on the new film, Terror Storm.
[01:55:19.084 --> 01:55:22.265]  We do have some copies left of the emergency release of it without the extras.
[01:55:23.245 --> 01:55:26.506]  The official film won't be out for three or four weeks, and we can't wait.
[01:55:26.526 --> 01:55:29.187]  We need to get Terror Storm out now without the extras.
[01:55:29.207 --> 01:55:30.787]  You can get it for $19.95.
[01:55:31.867 --> 01:55:32.147]  Get it.
[01:55:32.707 --> 01:55:33.808]  It's a collector's edition.
[01:55:33.848 --> 01:55:35.628]  I'm signing every copy that's shipped out of here.
[01:55:36.588 --> 01:55:38.889]  Get it and help us pay for this film.
[01:55:39.762 --> 01:55:41.084]  But that's not the main reason.
[01:55:41.124 --> 01:55:43.207]  The main reason is it is an incredibly good film.
[01:55:43.968 --> 01:55:48.454]  You can watch it right now, download it, give copies to people at PrisonPlanet.tv for 15 cents a day.

[01:55:55.575 --> 01:55:57.916]  But now is the time to take action on this.
[01:55:57.956 --> 01:55:59.077]  Get my film, Martial Law.
[01:55:59.097 --> 01:55:59.857]  Get Road to Tyranny.
[01:56:00.137 --> 01:56:01.118]  Get The Masters of Terror.
[01:56:01.178 --> 01:56:02.459]  Get Loose Change 2nd Edition.
[01:56:02.739 --> 01:56:03.699]  You've seen it on the web.
[01:56:03.759 --> 01:56:05.520]  Why not have a high quality DVD?
[01:56:05.920 --> 01:56:07.501]  Much more effective in waking people up.
[01:56:07.861 --> 01:56:08.822]  Super high quality.
[01:56:09.242 --> 01:56:10.763]  And you support those guys as well.

[01:58:02.208 --> 01:58:06.311]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:08.153 --> 01:58:11.375]  We're gonna try to get Clara Halperin on near the end of the show for an update.
[01:58:11.455 --> 01:58:14.938]  The police all arrived on our property in Piscataway, New Jersey.
[01:58:14.978 --> 01:58:17.900]  The 75 acres they're stealing, not even paying, or just taking.
[01:58:18.783 --> 01:58:22.346]  Local officials involved in the development of the land and the stealing.
[01:58:23.687 --> 01:58:31.032]  And riding shotgun with us for the entire hour will be Jack McClam who knows well about government land grabs and how people are under attack nationwide.
[01:58:31.592 --> 01:58:35.195]  Jack McClam for 24, 25 years has been fighting the New World Order.
[01:58:35.615 --> 01:58:40.738]  He is a vet from the Vietnam era, also the most highly decorated police officer in Phoenix, Arizona.
[01:58:41.039 --> 01:58:42.720]  History cop of the year, I believe twice.
[01:58:43.520 --> 01:58:46.923]  And he's here to talk about just all of the big issues we face right now.
[01:58:46.983 --> 01:58:51.806]  The American Union, the open borders, the gun control, the things that are happening.
[01:58:52.186 --> 01:58:54.448]  Jack McClam, it's good to have you on, my friend.
[01:58:54.468 --> 01:59:03.855]  The main reason you're here, though, I almost forgot, is because you are now on the GCN radio network, and we're so honored to have you Monday through Friday, my friend.
[01:59:04.435 --> 01:59:06.997]  Well, I'm excited about it, too, Brother Alex.
[01:59:07.237 --> 01:59:08.118]  Very excited.
[01:59:08.998 --> 01:59:10.960]  You guys do good work over there.
[01:59:11.966 --> 01:59:34.618]  We're just putting in about 14-16 hours a day here, and I know you put in long, long hours, because we're pulling out all stops to educate as many people as fast as we can, and of course GCN does an excellent job, and we're so pleased, our two police and military associations here are very pleased that I'm on there, so thank you.
[01:59:34.939 --> 01:59:37.340]  In fact, tell everybody about the Showtime and your website.
[01:59:38.274 --> 01:59:56.200]  Okay, the website is Police and Military Against the New World Order, but rather than put all that down in your search engine there, just put down JackMcLamb.com, and you'll come up with our organization, Police and Military Against the New World Order.
[01:59:57.040 --> 02:00:06.803]  And my program on GCN is from 5 to 6 Pacific Time, at 7 to 8 your time there, Alex, each day, five days a week.
[02:00:07.706 --> 02:00:13.333]  And it's called the Officer Jack McClam program, and we're just pleased and proud to be on GCN.
[02:00:13.493 --> 02:00:15.175]  Well, we're proud to have you, sir.
[02:00:15.316 --> 02:00:18.960]  You're one of the people that woke me up over 12 years ago.
[02:00:19.601 --> 02:00:25.688]  In fact, we have a lot of AM and FM affiliates out there, and I wanted to let them know that you're now here and you're now available.
[02:00:25.728 --> 02:00:26.710]  It's a great show.
[02:00:27.550 --> 02:00:39.740]  For that time slot on our program where you cover police and military affairs from position of support of the troops and of the police, but truly supporting them, exposing how they're being manipulated and controlled.
[02:00:39.800 --> 02:00:41.882]  I think it's a great show for stations to pick up.
[02:00:43.063 --> 02:00:44.003]  Well, thank you, Alex.
[02:00:44.284 --> 02:00:52.630]  Yes, we've been, we're all volunteers here and we've been volunteering now to try to educate our police and soldiers for almost 25 years now.
[02:00:54.249 --> 02:01:14.889]  God has blessed us by being able to reach a lot of police officers and soldiers, our peers, in uniform and tell them about what's really going on in the nation and so GCN certainly allowed us to do that job much more rapidly and that's our goal is to reach the hearts and minds of
[02:01:15.399 --> 02:01:27.428]  Our police and soldiers, and get them back under the sovereign people serving and protecting the sovereign people, Alex, instead of how we're trained today to serve and protect the system from the people.
[02:01:28.869 --> 02:01:33.273]  Well, that's what's happened, and police think that by taking our rights they protect us.
[02:01:33.613 --> 02:01:34.774]  They've been lied to, haven't they?
[02:01:35.054 --> 02:01:37.136]  They've been lied to, absolutely right.
[02:01:37.836 --> 02:01:39.878]  Yes, and more are waking up.
[02:01:39.958 --> 02:01:42.900]  I just received a letter from a sergeant in California
[02:01:44.164 --> 02:01:56.267]  A week ago, and I put it in my pocket, a letter, and didn't open it until yesterday, and I was quite surprised that the one-page letter here from him just shows you, Alex, what our police and soldiers are doing.
[02:01:57.108 --> 02:01:59.628]  He's, I don't know if we have time to share this.
[02:02:00.208 --> 02:02:02.489]  Yeah, let's read the letter when we get back from this quick break, Jack.
[02:02:02.509 --> 02:02:09.971]  Okay, yeah, I think it's exciting for the people to hear what our police and soldiers are capable of to serve and protect the American people.
[02:02:11.047 --> 02:02:13.248]  And at the same time, I want to get into the American Union.
[02:02:13.268 --> 02:02:20.373]  I mean, has it pleased you like it's pleased me, buoyed your heart to see the American Union now being mainstream news?
[02:02:21.033 --> 02:02:22.294]  Oh my goodness gracious.
[02:02:22.935 --> 02:02:23.995]  That is exciting.
[02:02:24.215 --> 02:02:33.321]  It's exciting because I know that the Bush crime family wanted to keep it a secret and did everything he could to keep it a secret, but it's beginning to get out, praise God.
[02:02:34.102 --> 02:02:36.043]  Well, that's made our credibility shoot
[02:02:36.713 --> 02:02:37.834]  To the moon, basically.
[02:02:38.534 --> 02:02:40.056]  Because we've been talking about this forever.
[02:02:40.476 --> 02:02:42.217]  Alright, we'll be right back.
[02:02:42.257 --> 02:02:42.798]  Stay with us.
[02:02:45.600 --> 02:02:47.121]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:02:47.301 --> 02:02:50.403]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[02:02:50.523 --> 02:02:54.446]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[02:02:54.486 --> 02:02:58.729]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[02:02:59.070 --> 02:03:02.832]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[02:03:02.973 --> 02:03:04.774]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[02:03:04.974 --> 02:03:08.258]  Why have police attached people on the streets indiscriminately?
[02:03:08.298 --> 02:03:13.023]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[02:03:13.183 --> 02:03:16.227]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[02:03:16.407 --> 02:03:19.270]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[02:03:19.751 --> 02:03:25.878]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[02:03:26.398 --> 02:03:30.182]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.
[02:03:30.603 --> 02:03:31.964]  Order your video today.
[02:03:32.345 --> 02:03:33.346]  Call toll free at 888-253-3139.

[02:03:45.120 --> 02:03:53.743]  Berkey Water Filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[02:03:53.963 --> 02:04:05.226]  The Berkey Light's self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, salt for odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[02:04:05.446 --> 02:04:08.107]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:04:08.447 --> 02:04:12.548]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled
[02:04:12.748 --> 02:04:14.890]  And it can be used anywhere on a flat surface.
[02:04:15.050 --> 02:04:16.932]  That's because it has an elevated base.
[02:04:17.132 --> 02:04:23.138]  The entire system joins together to make the Berkey Light convenient to transport even while it's filtering water.
[02:04:23.398 --> 02:04:29.064]  It's rechargeable bright white LED lamps allow for optimum use at night or during emergency conditions.
[02:04:29.384 --> 02:04:33.328]  Get the Berkey Light, the ultimate filter for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:04:33.348 --> 02:04:34.048]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[02:04:34.068 --> 02:04:34.749]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:04:46.644 --> 02:04:49.205]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here with an important question.
[02:04:49.365 --> 02:04:51.526]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[02:04:51.807 --> 02:05:01.892]  I mean the hard to find kind that's all natural and not full of corrosive toxins and chemicals and detergents that just dry out your skin and have been connected to very serious health problems?
[02:05:02.212 --> 02:05:04.533]  Let me tell you something about the Calbin Pure Soap Company.

[02:05:46.332 --> 02:05:48.514]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:05:48.534 --> 02:05:51.937]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:56.601 --> 02:05:57.822]  We're working with people.
[02:05:57.842 --> 02:05:58.622]  We're networking.
[02:05:58.662 --> 02:06:08.891]  We're supporting good Americans and good people on this planet that know about the Global Crime Syndicate, that are aware of its activities, and that want to fight it and defend their families.
[02:06:11.773 --> 02:06:13.915]  I mean, last hour we had a major Hollywood director
[02:06:14.762 --> 02:06:21.246]  Well, I'm talking about giving out 9-11 inside job videos and trying to wake up the neocongress Willis who's starting to wake up.
[02:06:21.326 --> 02:06:23.187]  I didn't even ask the director to talk about that.
[02:06:24.608 --> 02:06:26.129]  There's so many other prominent people.
[02:06:26.169 --> 02:06:31.732]  The former Marine Corps historian comes on a week ago and says the 9-11 story's a fraud and the dog doesn't hunt.
[02:06:31.792 --> 02:06:33.493]  And Offair says even more.
[02:06:33.553 --> 02:06:39.897]  The head of the 9-11 victim's families, the biggest group, goes public and says that it's got to be an inside job.
[02:06:39.937 --> 02:06:43.819]  I mean, every day more people are stepping up and stepping out!
[02:06:44.855 --> 02:06:47.098]  Jack McClam has a new show here on Genesis.
[02:06:47.138 --> 02:06:49.401]  He's been on the radio for over a decade now.
[02:06:49.721 --> 02:06:51.243]  He's now on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:51.263 --> 02:06:52.285]  We are so honored to have him.
[02:06:52.605 --> 02:06:54.127]  7 o'clock p.m.
[02:06:54.247 --> 02:06:56.550]  Central, every night 5 p.m.
[02:06:56.590 --> 02:07:00.195]  Pacific, 6 o'clock Mountain, 8 o'clock Eastern.
[02:07:01.613 --> 02:07:07.718]  You can listen right there at Infowars.com or GCNlive.com or just type Jack McClam into Google and you'll get his website.
[02:07:07.778 --> 02:07:09.559]  It's got big links to it as well.
[02:07:09.619 --> 02:07:13.622]  He's only been on for a few weeks and the show's really building and we are so honored to have him here with us.
[02:07:13.963 --> 02:07:25.832]  Jack, before we get into the American Union and what police and military are doing to fight the New World Order, your organization, let's get into
[02:07:26.821 --> 02:07:32.623]  That letter from that sergeant you got from California, and then I want to shift gears and talk about people waking up at 9-11.
[02:07:32.643 --> 02:07:33.523]  In fact, let's do that now.
[02:07:33.803 --> 02:07:37.244]  What do you think about how, I mean, we are bringing in a mighty harvest.
[02:07:37.784 --> 02:07:47.227]  The tyranny, as we always said, as it got worse, as it came into fruition, would be so obvious that people would be forced to wake up, and I'm really starting to see that happen, Jack, with the grace of God.
[02:07:48.167 --> 02:07:49.107]  Oh, yes, Alex.
[02:07:49.427 --> 02:07:52.528]  Likewise, here at our two police and military associations,
[02:07:53.186 --> 02:08:04.380]  Our contact is picking up and on our email, my goodness gracious, so much email are coming in we can't even, I've got 38,000 emails I haven't answered right now.
[02:08:04.840 --> 02:08:11.088]  So people are waking up brother and wonderful police and soldiers are waking up and helping us now.
[02:08:11.656 --> 02:08:17.718]  They've become our agents inside for God and country to help educate more police and soldiers.
[02:08:17.798 --> 02:08:19.519]  And by the way, that's not your opinion.
[02:08:19.659 --> 02:08:22.540]  All over the place they're having leaks, whistleblowers.
[02:08:22.640 --> 02:08:25.781]  It's bringing the New World Order to a grinding halt right now.
[02:08:26.141 --> 02:08:27.641]  It truly is, brother.
[02:08:27.681 --> 02:08:29.882]  We've got a great chance of winning this.
[02:08:30.622 --> 02:08:39.365]  And as long as we still have the First Amendment, you don't have to go to that third box the Founders gave us, the cartridge box.
[02:08:40.106 --> 02:08:50.715]  So we're just praying every day that we can win this non-violently as more and more people, both inside government and outside government, are waking up.
[02:08:51.075 --> 02:08:58.441]  And this sergeant is basically telling us that, Alex, I'd like to share this, a very small letter.
[02:08:58.461 --> 02:08:59.823]  Yeah, read it, please, please.
[02:08:59.863 --> 02:09:07.109]  Here's what it says, and you know how, Alex, when you walk around town, people will give you an envelope and say, read this when you can.
[02:09:07.771 --> 02:09:10.012]  Or a packet of papers and say, Alex, read this.
[02:09:10.072 --> 02:09:12.213]  Well, that happens to me here, too.
[02:09:12.873 --> 02:09:20.216]  And so, about a week and a half ago, a guy stuck this in my hand down in Cooski, Idaho, and said, hey, read this.
[02:09:20.336 --> 02:09:21.257]  It's very important.
[02:09:21.677 --> 02:09:25.919]  So I folded up, stuck it in my pocket, and kept on going about my task.
[02:09:26.619 --> 02:09:31.441]  And just last night, I got to it, opened it up, and it says here, Dear Brother Jack.
[02:09:32.101 --> 02:09:33.882]  June 30th is the date on it.
[02:09:34.386 --> 02:09:44.855]  Just thought I'd let you know that myself and several other law enforcement officers are members of a new militia which we formed here in blank California.
[02:09:44.875 --> 02:09:49.379]  I won't give you out the area in California because he's trying to protect his identity.
[02:09:49.900 --> 02:10:00.269]  Just like you did some years ago, we've been using our police and military training to train our fellow Californians in essential tactics and techniques to secure our homes,
[02:10:00.777 --> 02:10:09.080]  Our neighborhoods and state from those who would attack from without or enslave our families under a totalitarian system from within.
[02:10:09.801 --> 02:10:14.262]  As you know, this training is legal now, but it will not be in the future.
[02:10:14.322 --> 02:10:15.483]  And he's right about that.
[02:10:16.003 --> 02:10:24.266]  You can go out and shoot your guns and crawl through the woods and train in military tactics all you want to, but one day it'll be illegal.
[02:10:24.767 --> 02:10:30.429]  It goes on to say here, there are some very good books available now on winning against superior forces.
[02:10:30.990 --> 02:10:33.211]  Which will not be available in the future either.
[02:10:33.631 --> 02:10:34.891]  You know which books I mean.
[02:10:35.952 --> 02:10:38.573]  I can't tell you how important your issue was.
[02:10:39.253 --> 02:10:45.455]  We put out an issue ten years ago on militias, how legal they were, here at our Police-Military Association.
[02:10:45.816 --> 02:10:46.996]  That's what he's referring to.
[02:10:47.016 --> 02:10:51.498]  He says, I can't tell you how important the issue was on the legality of militias.
[02:10:52.538 --> 02:10:55.019]  That helped make our decision for us.
[02:10:55.515 --> 02:11:03.602]  It is long overdue that Americans start preparing and practicing for very difficult times and very dangerous times in the near future.
[02:11:04.102 --> 02:11:14.110]  No one here wants to see a violent situation, but we'd be a fool not to get ready in case it comes, and it looks very likely that it may come.
[02:11:14.770 --> 02:11:24.158]  Many of our law officers know the truth about 9-11, the truth about the wars of aggression against the Arabs by our nation's enemies to capture their land, oil, and to get
[02:11:24.557 --> 02:11:25.717]  World War III going.
[02:11:26.338 --> 02:11:33.300]  Our knowledge level is going up each day as we listen to your radio program and others on alternative radio.
[02:11:33.840 --> 02:11:37.281]  Keep up the work to awaken our brothers in law enforcement.
[02:11:37.701 --> 02:11:42.522]  We will have many more patriots inside the system as we educate our peers.
[02:11:43.183 --> 02:11:51.305]  As your website says, treason and tyranny cannot be enforced on the American people unless our soldiers and law officers enforce it.
[02:11:51.966 --> 02:11:59.412]  And we are working overtime to awaken more of our fellow officers by using your Constitutional Police and Soldier publication.
[02:12:00.053 --> 02:12:01.574]  We'll be back in touch.
[02:12:01.714 --> 02:12:02.635]  Don't let us down.
[02:12:02.735 --> 02:12:07.038]  Keep going with your educational materials so we can pass them on.
[02:12:07.619 --> 02:12:18.348]  And keep up the radio show so we can feed more fellow officers the facts of what's coming our way, which we officers will play a large part in, for good or bad.
[02:12:18.908 --> 02:12:19.749]  Sergeant Morris,
[02:12:20.333 --> 02:12:22.635]  Not my real name, you understand.
[02:12:23.496 --> 02:12:24.396]  That's how he signed it.
[02:12:24.436 --> 02:12:34.424]  But isn't that amazing, Alex, that he's in California, and I have a guy hand me an envelope down in Cooski, Idaho, and it's from Sergeant Morris over there.
[02:12:34.704 --> 02:12:37.106]  You know, so this is what's going on.
[02:12:37.226 --> 02:12:44.772]  The soldiers and police officers are smart enough to know that if they put their heads up, they're going to have their heads chopped off.
[02:12:45.914 --> 02:12:52.562]  Like I did, I was the most highly decorated officer in the history of Phoenix, Arizona, Alex.
[02:12:53.042 --> 02:13:00.010]  But after I started writing about the Constitution to my peers, I became the most fired officer in the history of Phoenix, Arizona.
[02:13:00.511 --> 02:13:02.994]  So, Sergeant Morris has been very wise.
[02:13:03.738 --> 02:13:05.499]  Let's shift gears to the bad guys.
[02:13:05.519 --> 02:13:12.603]  The BATF and the FBI and Foreign Canadian Royal Mounted Police raided Richard Salata a few weeks ago.
[02:13:12.643 --> 02:13:13.983]  He's now gone public about it.
[02:13:14.103 --> 02:13:16.625]  Aaron Zellman was even on the phone with him when it all happened.
[02:13:16.645 --> 02:13:17.905]  He talked to the FBI.
[02:13:18.385 --> 02:13:22.327]  They came in, pointed at anti-Nazi material from JPFO.
[02:13:22.768 --> 02:13:28.050]  They pointed at my police state, three total enslavement, at a book of the speeches of George Washington.
[02:13:28.090 --> 02:13:29.251]  We have a photo of the materials.
[02:13:29.971 --> 02:13:35.455]  And they came because he gave the share of my materials, and some of your materials, and a bunch of materials.
[02:13:35.895 --> 02:13:40.598]  The Miracle of America, the founding documents, the citizen rule book we mail out to everybody.
[02:13:41.679 --> 02:13:46.242]  They call them subversive, they call them all sorts of names, and this isn't the first time.
[02:13:46.943 --> 02:13:58.250]  I mean, we have a lot of these cases that are confirmed, like Kelly Rushing, there in Lyon County, Kentucky, was arrested for giving a state trooper a Ron Paul speech in the floor of the House.
[02:13:58.310 --> 02:13:59.111]  I mean, that's how
[02:14:00.712 --> 02:14:10.421]  So contrast good officers to people that could go into a gun manufacturer's home and not arrest him and just very upset about a constitutional material.
[02:14:11.522 --> 02:14:23.773]  Well brother, sadly, you know, we're not aware, we think that, take you back to East Germany just a minute, when the East German police and military were shooting
[02:14:26.101 --> 02:14:39.829]  You know, children, men and women, as they were trying to climb over the wall, we were told that these were the dregs of society, these were the most evil people that were doing these, manning these machine guns, but in essence, it was not.
[02:14:39.989 --> 02:14:52.077]  It was the most patriotic police and soldiers they had that had been brainwashed that it was for the good of society that these people be killed that were domestic terrorists or whatever they named them back then.
[02:14:52.917 --> 02:14:54.038]  And, of course,
[02:14:54.780 --> 02:15:10.254]  The sad thing is, when I was an academy instructor in the sixth largest city in the United States, I saw the brainwashing going on of our police officers to tell them that they would be asked to do things one day they wouldn't want to do, they would be asked to
[02:15:11.813 --> 02:15:13.395]  I don't know.
[02:15:29.173 --> 02:15:35.735]  Certain groups of people, as the enemy of America, enemy of liberty and freedom, in the field of the military, believe it!
[02:15:35.975 --> 02:15:40.177]  And by the way, we have the federally written documents from Virginia, Texas, Arizona.
[02:15:40.617 --> 02:15:43.078]  We have them from all over the country, and we have the federal training.
[02:15:43.118 --> 02:15:44.078]  It lists homeschoolers.
[02:15:44.678 --> 02:15:58.604]  People that talk about the Constitution, a land rights activist as terrorist, and then we talked to a man earlier in the first hour who had basically whopped part of his hand off, went into an emergency clinic, he had InfoWars and anti-U.N.
[02:15:58.624 --> 02:15:59.444]  stickers on his car.
[02:15:59.724 --> 02:16:01.745]  They refused him care because of it.
[02:16:02.485 --> 02:16:02.905]  Wow!
[02:16:03.206 --> 02:16:04.806]  I hadn't heard about that one.
[02:16:05.306 --> 02:16:08.688]  But I'll tell you, brother, the line is being drawn in the sand.
[02:16:08.728 --> 02:16:11.549]  The enemies of God and liberty that run this country
[02:16:12.139 --> 02:16:20.067]  In much of the world, these international criminals, they're scared to death because the people are waking up and they don't want that.
[02:16:20.127 --> 02:16:24.031]  I mean, they've got a ways to go yet to put it under martial law.
[02:16:24.271 --> 02:16:25.732]  Well, that's it, Jack.
[02:16:26.012 --> 02:16:26.693]  Jack, that's it.
[02:16:26.713 --> 02:16:27.754]  I mean, how does it feel to you?
[02:16:27.774 --> 02:16:28.475]  I've got to interrupt here.
[02:16:28.495 --> 02:16:29.216]  How does it feel?
[02:16:29.596 --> 02:16:34.801]  I mean, we were there when the days were really dark, and I'm sure it can get dark again, but we're not hyping this.
[02:16:34.861 --> 02:16:35.822]  People are really waking up.
[02:16:35.842 --> 02:16:36.623]  Does it feel good?
[02:16:37.268 --> 02:16:43.273]  It's fantastic, but it's scaring the enemy to death because they know there's many more of us than there are of them.
[02:16:45.636 --> 02:16:46.316]  Please continue.
[02:16:46.937 --> 02:16:47.277]  Yes.
[02:16:47.617 --> 02:16:57.666]  Well, yes, I saw the training in the police academies, the giant police academy there in Phoenix, Arizona, which was the regional police academy.
[02:16:58.327 --> 02:17:03.171]  As these police officers were told, they're no longer citizens, they're an entity of government.
[02:17:03.723 --> 02:17:07.927]  They're raised above the citizens to better supervise the citizens for their own good.
[02:17:08.467 --> 02:17:19.096]  And the brainwashing is just incredible as they prepare these officers, and of course it's going on with soldiers too, to do what they're told for the good of the country.
[02:17:19.157 --> 02:17:23.120]  If they love this nation, they will do what they're told without any question.
[02:17:24.181 --> 02:17:26.363]  But the Founding Fathers said the exact opposite.
[02:17:26.803 --> 02:17:27.284]  They did.
[02:17:28.004 --> 02:17:28.685]  Indeed they did.
[02:17:29.460 --> 02:17:30.502]  Jack McClain, stay there.
[02:17:30.522 --> 02:17:40.817]  I want to talk about the American Union and how long you've been researching that and working on that and what this new national news, you know, admitting it, what effect that's had on police and military and your correspondence.
[02:17:40.837 --> 02:17:41.438]  We'll be right back.

[02:18:46.545 --> 02:18:50.211]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[02:18:50.631 --> 02:18:56.059]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[02:18:56.520 --> 02:18:57.602]  It makes me wonder if the U.S.
[02:18:57.622 --> 02:19:01.627]  citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[02:19:02.328 --> 02:19:15.632]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Ruling 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act in Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[02:19:15.652 --> 02:19:21.453]  For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.
[02:19:21.733 --> 02:19:27.615]  Whether if you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not, I have instructed my representatives to give this report out free.

[02:19:47.546 --> 02:19:48.587]  The War on Terrorism.
[02:19:48.908 --> 02:19:51.692]  Will it be fought overseas, or will it affect us here at home?
[02:19:51.972 --> 02:19:56.138]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[02:19:56.558 --> 02:19:57.379]  So what do you do?
[02:19:57.700 --> 02:20:02.266]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[02:20:02.748 --> 02:20:04.870]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.

[02:20:46.024 --> 02:20:50.668]  According to the American Diabetes Association, more than 18 million people in the U.S.
[02:20:50.708 --> 02:20:51.428]  have diabetes.
[02:20:51.769 --> 02:20:58.714]  Most people with diabetes have risk factors such as obesity, high blood pressure, and cholesterol, which increase their risk for heart disease.
[02:20:58.874 --> 02:21:03.398]  For example, more than 65% of people with diabetes die from heart disease or stroke.
[02:21:03.598 --> 02:21:06.420]  Finding out you or your loved ones have diabetes can be scary.

[02:21:48.286 --> 02:21:54.330]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:21:54.930 --> 02:21:57.912]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:21:59.793 --> 02:22:01.595]  My new film, Terror Storm, is out.
[02:22:01.675 --> 02:22:03.035]  It needs to get out to everyone.
[02:22:03.075 --> 02:22:06.878]  It's up to you to get the original DVD copy and burn copies of it.
[02:22:06.898 --> 02:22:09.259]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're in an information war.
[02:22:09.279 --> 02:22:14.643]  We're going to open the phones up in the next segment if you want to talk to Jack McClam, police and military against the New World Order.
[02:22:15.316 --> 02:22:17.858]  A wonderful American we're honored to have now on the Genesis Network.
[02:22:18.298 --> 02:22:20.039]  Weeknights at 7 p.m.
[02:22:20.159 --> 02:22:22.000]  Central Standard Time, 8 p.m.
[02:22:22.060 --> 02:22:23.541]  Eastern, 5 p.m.
[02:22:23.921 --> 02:22:25.422]  Pacific, 6 p.m.
[02:22:25.643 --> 02:22:26.043]  Mountain.
[02:22:26.889 --> 02:22:28.430]  We are honored to have him with us now.
[02:22:28.890 --> 02:22:48.777]  Jack, I mean, what was it like when suddenly Lou Dobbs, and now even Glenn Beck, and now all these national publications are admitting they're reading the documents that unelected boards are already merging us into an American Union, and then to see the EU failing in Europe and its expansion, to see the American Union south of Mexico failing, but here they just move forward, but at least they tried to keep it secret.
[02:22:48.797 --> 02:22:51.578]  As you said, it is now breaking, and they are crumbling.
[02:22:54.271 --> 02:23:17.782]  Well, Alex, what's going on, we see here at our two police military associations is that there are people on the hard left, the Marxist, Trotskyites, and Communists here in this country, who have been listening to this diatribe that there's going to be a chicken in every pot when we have this Marxist world government, and there'll be freedom and everything for everybody.
[02:23:18.263 --> 02:23:23.065]  And all of a sudden, their own oxen are beginning to get gored in this country here,
[02:23:23.949 --> 02:23:32.836]  And they're beginning to look at it more carefully, and a lot of them are coming out and saying, wait a minute now, I don't think I'm going to be one of these elite.
[02:23:33.176 --> 02:23:36.738]  It looks like I'm going to be on the bottom level, no middle class.
[02:23:37.299 --> 02:23:48.047]  And they're beginning to speak out about these things as never before, and this is great to see the left and the right, you know, of course these are all just made up things, but
[02:23:48.857 --> 02:23:55.763]  But to see all the people beginning to look at this in reality and say, wait a minute, national sovereignty gone for America?
[02:23:56.203 --> 02:23:59.947]  We're going to be like a European Union here in this American Union?
[02:24:00.667 --> 02:24:08.614]  And they're beginning to say, wait a minute, I've got kids and grandkids here that I'm not sure that I want to see them grow up in this kind of a system.
[02:24:08.674 --> 02:24:11.096]  So it's breaking loose, Alex.
[02:24:11.216 --> 02:24:14.179]  It's beginning to break loose on television.
[02:24:14.259 --> 02:24:16.421]  It's beginning to break loose in Hollywood.
[02:24:17.011 --> 02:24:22.134]  Thanks to a lot of your help and Genesis Communication Network.
[02:24:22.854 --> 02:24:29.117]  And it's exciting because the International Crime Syndicate used to have control of the left.
[02:24:29.217 --> 02:24:36.281]  You know, they'd have total control and then they came in with the neocons that took control of the Republican fascist system.
[02:24:37.842 --> 02:24:40.123]  But now it seems to be coming apart for them.
[02:24:41.187 --> 02:24:42.629]  All I can say is hallelujah!
[02:24:43.450 --> 02:24:55.506]  I agree and I've analyzed this, I've looked at this, I've spent many hours sitting in a chair in my living room just focusing and thinking as a layman investigator really trying to get the answers with the data I have.
[02:24:56.107 --> 02:25:02.929]  And even if the globalists carry out an even bigger terror attack, which they'll probably be forced to do, I think that's going to blow up in their face, pun intended.
[02:25:02.969 --> 02:25:10.632]  I mean, every angle I look at, every line of reasoning I study, I see that the globalists are losing power, the people are gaining power.
[02:25:11.052 --> 02:25:23.756]  The problem is they've got the high ground still in the media, in the government, in the military, and so they may be able to go ahead and try to maintain control, but I think as they are forced to flex their muscles and exert force,
[02:25:24.436 --> 02:25:25.918]  In the end, that ensures they lose.
[02:25:25.938 --> 02:25:26.919]  Do you see the point I'm making?
[02:25:27.320 --> 02:25:29.763]  I certainly do, and it's right on target.
[02:25:30.023 --> 02:25:44.300]  And you notice that we here at our police and military association believe that the Bush crime family and his overlords would do another terrorist attack here in the United States before now, but what we noticed is
[02:25:45.063 --> 02:25:54.130]  All over the world, they're kind of scared, I think, to blow up something again here because the 9-11 truth is getting out there to so many people.
[02:25:55.391 --> 02:26:01.635]  But they're blowing up things around the world to keep us reminded of this Al-Qaeda out there, Al-Qaeda.
[02:26:02.396 --> 02:26:09.141]  Notice that the poor people in India just got blown up again this morning, I guess.
[02:26:09.915 --> 02:26:27.545]  And so they keep setting off these bombs all over the world to keep the fear factor going in the nations that were not supporting them, really supporting them to gain more support for their wars of taking over all these nations in the Middle East and putting in these puppet governments.
[02:26:27.935 --> 02:26:30.336]  Well, speaking of L.A., when I was out there, there was some L.A.P.D.
[02:26:30.376 --> 02:26:37.379]  there at the hotel, some plainclothes guys, also some of Sheen and some other people's bodyguards were there who were off to the L.A.P.D.
[02:26:37.859 --> 02:26:38.040]  Yeah.
[02:26:38.080 --> 02:26:39.780]  And they were all nodding their heads, shaking my hand.
[02:26:39.800 --> 02:26:41.221]  They were already fans.
[02:26:41.941 --> 02:26:43.702]  They already knew about the New World Order.
[02:26:43.722 --> 02:26:45.363]  And I said, how many L.A.P.D.
[02:26:45.443 --> 02:26:45.943]  know about this?
[02:26:45.963 --> 02:26:46.783]  And he goes, ha!
[02:26:47.124 --> 02:26:48.004]  We all know!
[02:26:50.385 --> 02:26:51.686]  That's exciting, brother.
[02:26:51.706 --> 02:26:52.566]  Really exciting.
[02:26:52.606 --> 02:26:56.988]  Because I'll tell you what, police and military are the enforcers.
[02:26:57.634 --> 02:27:13.069]  And if the police and military will not enforce tyranny on the American people, and if they see things happening under the table, like these bombings and all, and come forward, the New World Order has a big problem, and they know that.
[02:27:15.171 --> 02:27:16.392]  Oh boy, it's incredible.
[02:27:16.452 --> 02:27:20.596]  We'll get into the open borders and Bush and the Democrats pushing that.
[02:27:21.678 --> 02:27:25.481]  Talk about some of these fake neocon talk show hosts that are losing all credibility.
[02:27:25.901 --> 02:27:27.783]  And take your calls on the other side.
[02:27:27.803 --> 02:27:35.168]  Stay with us.
[02:27:36.209 --> 02:27:37.110]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.610 --> 02:27:39.211]  The empire's on the run.
[02:27:40.132 --> 02:27:42.814]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.010 --> 02:27:51.977]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism, but globalism.
[02:27:59.878 --> 02:28:00.258]  We're good.
[02:28:16.525 --> 02:28:17.045]  We're good.
[02:28:45.803 --> 02:28:48.825]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[02:28:49.145 --> 02:28:54.069]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[02:28:54.309 --> 02:28:58.671]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[02:28:58.972 --> 02:29:07.877]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[02:29:08.098 --> 02:29:11.720]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[02:29:12.000 --> 02:29:17.026]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[02:29:17.327 --> 02:29:24.015]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[02:29:24.528 --> 02:29:25.189]  What about you?
[02:29:25.829 --> 02:29:31.194]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[02:29:46.403 --> 02:29:49.684]  Do you remember when you could eat most anything and not worry about it?
[02:29:50.164 --> 02:29:52.345]  Or maybe weight management has always been a problem?
[02:29:52.845 --> 02:29:58.227]  Are you frustrated, burned out, and tired of fad diets and marketing gimmicks that don't really work?
[02:29:58.747 --> 02:30:04.629]  Do you want a proven system, a long-term solution, to live a healthier lifestyle and properly manage your weight?

[02:30:46.633 --> 02:30:49.395]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[02:30:49.415 --> 02:30:53.317]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:31:09.086 --> 02:31:12.488]  Your calls are coming up for Jack McClam, a great American patriot.
[02:31:12.508 --> 02:31:13.569]  Before we go back to Jack,
[02:31:17.515 --> 02:31:20.537]  I want everybody to know that my new film, Terror Storm, is out.
[02:31:20.618 --> 02:31:24.100]  I put more work into this film than I put into any other documentary we've made.
[02:31:24.240 --> 02:31:28.724]  It's got Ray McGovern, former high-level CIA analyst, getting into the 9-11 and the phony war.
[02:31:28.824 --> 02:31:34.148]  It's got Professor Stephen Jones getting into the thermite with an interview we did with him, a sit-down interview.
[02:31:35.149 --> 02:31:39.953]  It's got Morgan Reynolds, the head economist for Bush in his last administration.
[02:31:40.928 --> 02:31:55.812]  At the Department of Labor, it's got interviews with Michael Meacher, Blair Cabinet Member, former Cabinet Member, Member of Parliament, currently exposing 9-11 as an inside job, MI5 agents, David Shaler and Andy Michon talking about 7-7 being an inside job and 9-11.
[02:31:56.092 --> 02:31:59.012]  We go to London, we go to Crawford, Texas, and show you the neocons.
[02:31:59.652 --> 02:32:10.295]  The film starts with a history of government-sponsored terror, Operation Gladio, the USS Liberty, Hitler and the Reichstag, and how he attacked his own operation there outside Glywoods to attack Poland.
[02:32:11.087 --> 02:32:12.368]  We get into the whole war.
[02:32:12.748 --> 02:32:15.749]  We get into 9-11 in the last 20 minutes with all the latest information.
[02:32:16.269 --> 02:32:18.370]  It's got my bullhorning in Chicago.
[02:32:18.390 --> 02:32:21.191]  It is such an amazing film.
[02:32:21.271 --> 02:32:22.652]  I'm so proud of it.
[02:32:24.932 --> 02:32:26.373]  It moves fast.
[02:32:27.273 --> 02:32:30.635]  It is designed for the general public that is ignorant on these issues.
[02:32:30.715 --> 02:32:32.255]  It is made to wake people up.
[02:32:32.715 --> 02:32:35.276]  It is an information warfare bomb.
[02:32:36.697 --> 02:32:38.818]  It will blow lives to pieces.
[02:32:39.545 --> 02:32:45.407]  You can get high-quality digital DVDs right now at InfoWars.com.
[02:32:45.427 --> 02:32:46.208]  They don't have the extras.
[02:32:46.248 --> 02:32:47.788]  It'll still be three or four weeks until that's ready.
[02:32:49.529 --> 02:32:54.271]  We've still got to make the menus, and we're making the cover for it, and we've got to send it off, and we just can't wait.
[02:32:54.331 --> 02:32:59.533]  So you can get the fancy-dandy one in three or four weeks, but we just can't wait another week to ship it to you.
[02:33:01.314 --> 02:33:04.555]  Plus, it's a way to support us, and when the official one comes out, I hope we'll get a copy of that, too.
[02:33:06.801 --> 02:33:10.404]  But bottom line, I decided to just put the DVD out with the film on it.
[02:33:11.765 --> 02:33:13.366]  And it's an American Scholar Symposium.
[02:33:13.386 --> 02:33:14.687]  That's what it says in the menu.
[02:33:15.007 --> 02:33:15.967]  It's a special edition.
[02:33:16.007 --> 02:33:18.549]  I'm signing every copy that goes out.
[02:33:19.670 --> 02:33:21.331]  And we'll only have these for a few more weeks.
[02:33:21.591 --> 02:33:22.672]  Maybe they may run out.
[02:33:23.032 --> 02:33:24.794]  And there'll be a few weeks where it's not available.
[02:33:24.954 --> 02:33:27.235]  Get your copy of Terror Storm now.
[02:33:27.796 --> 02:33:31.278]  I am so proud of it via the safe, secure online shopping cart at InfoWars.com.

[02:33:58.931 --> 02:34:00.672]  Terror Storm is now available.
[02:34:00.772 --> 02:34:02.092]  Secure your copy today.

[02:34:09.194 --> 02:34:12.975]  You can stream it, you can get the film, you can burn copies of it, give it to people.
[02:34:13.015 --> 02:34:14.416]  That way, a great activist tool.
[02:34:14.816 --> 02:34:20.977]  All 15 of my films, my book, Paul Watson's book, the entire 9-11 symposium from LA two weeks ago is being uploaded.
[02:34:21.197 --> 02:34:22.718]  Half of it plus is up there now.
[02:34:23.726 --> 02:34:26.708]  PrisonPlanet.tv, 15 cents a day, monthly subscription for $5.95.

[02:34:33.072 --> 02:34:34.032]  And then what do we do?
[02:34:34.072 --> 02:34:41.117]  We have all these other activists, all these other truth tellers, all these other patriots on this show, day in, day out, and support their operations.
[02:34:41.177 --> 02:34:44.999]  We, I see myself as, this operation is like an aircraft carrier.
[02:34:45.319 --> 02:34:51.743]  And we're out here trying to get the best and brightest on board on this broadcast, on the websites, to continually launch sorties at the enemy.
[02:34:52.563 --> 02:34:55.925]  To empower our fleets that are out there.
[02:34:56.265 --> 02:35:03.668]  And we're like huge clusters of armadas out there attacking the New World Order mainland.
[02:35:03.969 --> 02:35:04.869]  We are crushing them.
[02:35:04.889 --> 02:35:05.749]  We are burning them.
[02:35:05.769 --> 02:35:06.870]  We are smashing them.
[02:35:07.150 --> 02:35:08.631]  And I'm only one small part of that.
[02:35:08.671 --> 02:35:10.772]  And I just thank God every day that I'm in this position.
[02:35:11.132 --> 02:35:13.753]  That I've been blessed and that we're here fighting these creatures.
[02:35:13.773 --> 02:35:16.234]  So please get Terror Storm right now.
[02:35:16.294 --> 02:35:18.635]  I'm so proud of this film.
[02:35:19.015 --> 02:35:20.296]  I haven't hyped it properly.
[02:35:20.356 --> 02:35:24.178]  I've been so busy I'm not even really promoting it on the sites or on other radio shows.
[02:35:24.198 --> 02:35:27.959]  I've been turning down radio interviews every day because I'm so busy trying to do other things.
[02:35:28.880 --> 02:35:29.640]  We can't do it all.
[02:35:29.700 --> 02:35:31.421]  We need you to help us get this out.
[02:35:32.737 --> 02:35:35.059]  We need you to spread the word and expose these killers.
[02:35:35.580 --> 02:35:37.361]  Jack McClam, I mean, we can talk all day.
[02:35:37.421 --> 02:35:44.288]  How important is it for the actual listeners to take action and become activists, truth-tellers, fighters in their area?
[02:35:45.288 --> 02:35:51.174]  Well, brother, you know, it just isn't going to happen without people doing that.
[02:35:51.334 --> 02:35:58.500]  We've been telling people to get a piece of paper and put GCN and how people can get on GCN
[02:35:59.760 --> 02:36:21.996]  Live.com and cut them up and hand them out to neighbors and relatives and friends and just get your tapes out, get our newsletter out and anything possible every single day make it a goal to touch one person with truth and information and if people listening would do that make it a point every day
[02:36:22.762 --> 02:36:26.823]  to reach somebody, then the enemy can't win, brother.
[02:36:27.443 --> 02:36:36.886]  As thousands and thousands a minute wake up around this country, and there's millions a month waking up, it's just got the enemy on the run.
[02:36:37.066 --> 02:36:40.287]  Well, that's something that we get so busy in my small office, we haven't done.
[02:36:40.307 --> 02:36:44.409]  We get sent great flyers, people design, we post them, and they get put in the archives.
[02:36:44.449 --> 02:36:50.910]  We need to put a link on GCNlive.com with printable flyers for people, make it easy.
[02:36:50.930 --> 02:36:52.471]  Yes, that would be wonderful.
[02:36:52.831 --> 02:36:55.633]  Infowars.com needs to put all that in one spot.
[02:36:56.234 --> 02:36:57.115]  We need to do that.
[02:36:57.155 --> 02:36:58.476]  That's something I've been meaning to do.
[02:36:58.536 --> 02:37:00.998]  We haven't done it properly, but we will execute that, Jack.
[02:37:01.278 --> 02:37:07.963]  Yeah, we've got a buddy in Phoenix that every Sunday he does something for God.
[02:37:08.163 --> 02:37:10.125]  One Sunday, Alex, he goes to church.
[02:37:10.205 --> 02:37:18.432]  The next Sunday, he's out in the parking lot of other churches in Tempe, Mesa, Scottsdale, Phoenix, putting
[02:37:18.972 --> 02:37:22.834]  Flyers on the windshield of all the cars in the church parking lots.
[02:37:23.254 --> 02:37:27.135]  And then the next week he goes to church and the next week he goes out into the parking lots.
[02:37:27.636 --> 02:37:30.477]  Everybody can do this, but they need the flyers.
[02:37:31.417 --> 02:37:35.579]  And so it would be wonderful if GCN could put out some downloadable flyers.
[02:37:36.127 --> 02:37:44.374]  That people could just take out and hand out if they're standing in a grocery line at a store, turn around and hand them out to people in front of you and back of you?
[02:37:44.714 --> 02:37:45.615]  Well, we're not going to wait.
[02:37:45.675 --> 02:37:48.397]  We've made quite a few others and made them over the years.
[02:37:48.777 --> 02:37:52.640]  We never put them in a section, but we'll put it in an activist or flyer section.
[02:37:53.000 --> 02:38:03.529]  And listeners, if you want to design flyers for GCN or PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com, email those to Ryan at InfoWars.com and we will post those in the flyer section.
[02:38:04.196 --> 02:38:05.276]  Okay, wonderful.
[02:38:05.716 --> 02:38:09.277]  Wonderful, because everybody can do something every day to touch people.
[02:38:09.817 --> 02:38:17.719]  Well, you know, I run into so many people over the years who say, you can't fight City Hall, you can't get involved, you can't affect change, and, you know, I'm just going to sit here in the dirt and die.
[02:38:18.199 --> 02:38:25.420]  They don't understand that those of us that have fought know the experience of failure, of success, of drawing a blank.
[02:38:25.801 --> 02:38:30.201]  Different things happen every time, but if you just keep taking action, you're going to gain ground.
[02:38:30.222 --> 02:38:32.402]  What was the old Texas Ranger saying?
[02:38:33.979 --> 02:38:35.080]  I've got it hanging here on the wall.
[02:38:35.100 --> 02:38:35.581]  Let me get it.
[02:38:36.001 --> 02:38:41.307]  It's no man in the wrong can stand up against a fella that's in the right and that keeps on a coming.
[02:38:41.567 --> 02:38:43.449]  Texas Ranger Captain Bill McDonald.
[02:38:43.749 --> 02:38:44.430]  I like that.
[02:38:44.590 --> 02:38:45.371]  That's wonderful.
[02:38:45.491 --> 02:38:50.416]  Well, you know, the Holy Scriptures too tells us that we're supposed to put feet to our prayers.
[02:38:50.496 --> 02:38:55.702]  I know people are praying every day and that's wonderful that we win this thing, but God
[02:38:56.266 --> 02:39:01.274]  Tells us in Psalms 94-16 that we have to rise up against the evildoers.
[02:39:01.675 --> 02:39:04.700]  We have to stand up against the workers of iniquity, Alex.
[02:39:04.720 --> 02:39:09.929]  So even the Bible, God is telling us to get out of our derrieres.
[02:39:10.385 --> 02:39:12.327]  And do something against this evil!
[02:39:12.427 --> 02:39:18.632]  Well, over and over again in the Bible, I just randomly open it up every day, and constantly I see things like, who will stand up against the wicked men for me?
[02:39:18.652 --> 02:39:19.312]  That's right!
[02:39:19.572 --> 02:39:20.593]  Amen, that's right!
[02:39:20.793 --> 02:39:25.117]  That's right, and that's what more and more people are doing, and it's having a tremendous effect.
[02:39:25.417 --> 02:39:29.160]  I want to go to calls, but first, I get these type of emails every day.
[02:39:30.555 --> 02:39:36.276]  I mean, we get orders for videos directly to the NSA, folks, and then there's an added comment about, oh, we support you.
[02:39:36.296 --> 02:39:37.017]  Really weird.
[02:39:37.977 --> 02:39:40.338]  Not emails every day from the NSA, but emails from government every day.
[02:39:40.358 --> 02:39:48.940]  But here's one, I'm not going to give too much out, but it says, I know that this email is supposed to be media only, but I couldn't find any other email address on the site.
[02:39:50.060 --> 02:39:50.600]  I'm a U.S.
[02:39:50.660 --> 02:39:51.300]  Army captain.
[02:39:51.320 --> 02:39:52.601]  Now, I get these every day.
[02:39:53.061 --> 02:39:53.901]  Serving a long
[02:39:54.898 --> 02:39:57.720]  A year-long tour in Iraq for the second time in four years.
[02:39:58.100 --> 02:40:03.985]  The first time I was here I found the website and read it every day that I could get an internet connection.
[02:40:04.065 --> 02:40:10.629]  I spent a better part of that year spreading the word and soon my entire platoon and half the company was buzzing about the site.
[02:40:10.989 --> 02:40:20.036]  We ordered your movies and then we had discussions for hours breaking them out of the mold the army created and teaching them to think for themselves.
[02:40:20.536 --> 02:40:26.982]  The point of this email is to thank you for what you do and to see if you possibly have any deals for us over here.
[02:40:27.003 --> 02:40:28.224]  I would hate to...
[02:40:29.224 --> 02:40:38.351]  We thought of it as a freeloader, but we don't have all that much money, but I still want to broaden the horizon of this new band of soldiers that I am deployed with this time.
[02:40:38.431 --> 02:40:46.376]  My soldiers, many soldiers ask of me, but I cannot find a better way of sitting them down in front of your videos and then discussing them.
[02:40:46.456 --> 02:40:48.018]  Thanks either way.
[02:40:48.398 --> 02:40:50.259]  Quote, please don't share my name with anyone.
[02:40:50.579 --> 02:40:53.422]  The higher-ups would probably burn me at the stroke.
[02:40:53.702 --> 02:40:55.723]  Sincerely, Captain U.S.
[02:40:55.803 --> 02:40:56.724]  Army with his name.
[02:40:56.984 --> 02:40:57.945]  He's a West Pointer.
[02:40:58.605 --> 02:41:17.602]  And I know so many Marines that come back, and this goes back years, and they tell me, people I know personally in high school and college who went off to be in the military, they come back and they go, Alex, you know, I've been in the Marines for 10 years, and you know, I'm an officer, and I showed them one of your videos, one of the milder ones, America's War by Design, and you know, they basically demoted me and did all these bad things to me.
[02:41:17.942 --> 02:41:19.583]  I mean, what's wrong with our videos, Jack?
[02:41:20.084 --> 02:41:25.949]  Well, you know, the military and law enforcement's run by the New World Order right now, and
[02:41:26.636 --> 02:41:41.990]  These guys have to keep their head down a little bit and pamphleteer without being caught and put things on bulletin boards and, you know, flyers on bulletin boards and use gloves because they'll take your fingerprints off the flyers, guys and gals out there.
[02:41:42.530 --> 02:41:44.312]  I'm talking from experience.
[02:41:44.412 --> 02:41:48.796]  We've had a major come into the boot camp
[02:41:50.727 --> 02:41:59.171]  Marine Boot Camp and hold up an Operation Vampire Killer 2000 waving it around and says, have any of you guys ever read this?
[02:41:59.711 --> 02:42:02.132]  And two guys jumped up and says, yes sir!
[02:42:02.733 --> 02:42:10.236]  And they were let out and the third guy that kept his head down wrote to us and told us those two guys never came back to boot camp.
[02:42:10.757 --> 02:42:17.360]  So they're scared to death of their forces, their enforcers of this new world order learning the truth
[02:42:17.884 --> 02:42:26.127]  That the American people are going to be enslaved, and that really ticks off soldiers and police officers once they learn the truth, because they are highly patriotic.
[02:42:27.327 --> 02:42:33.829]  Yeah, this is such a free country, why are they kicking people out of the military who've just read something, when all it is is the Constitution?
[02:42:33.869 --> 02:42:34.670]  Let's take calls.
[02:42:35.590 --> 02:42:37.771]  First up, uh, who's up first here?
[02:42:39.071 --> 02:42:40.792]  Steve in Colorado, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:42:42.092 --> 02:42:44.233]  Yeah, hello there Alex and, uh, Jack.
[02:42:45.538 --> 02:42:47.780]  Nice to be able to talk to two true patriots.
[02:42:48.901 --> 02:42:50.603]  And thank you, Jack, for that scripture.
[02:42:50.643 --> 02:43:05.698]  That was quite... My question for you, Jack, is down there in Phoenix, do you remember that flyer that Sheriff Arpaio out of Maricopa County put out a few years ago?
[02:43:06.399 --> 02:43:08.481]  Yes, showing the domestic terrorists.
[02:43:09.068 --> 02:43:11.170]  Right, and the FBI put it out actually.
[02:43:11.190 --> 02:43:19.577]  The FBI put it out, but it had Sheriff Arpaio's, the Sheriff's logo on it, and he got ticked off about that because he didn't have anything to do with it.
[02:43:19.717 --> 02:43:21.258]  He's a personal buddy of mine.
[02:43:21.858 --> 02:43:22.919]  Really?
[02:43:23.019 --> 02:43:38.452]  Yeah, and that flyer lists Christians, they call them Doomsday Cult groups, which Butch Reno under Clinton, remember that's exactly what she called Christians, Doomsday Cult members.
[02:43:38.962 --> 02:43:49.730]  And that's what they list in that flyer, FBI flyer for police officer eyes only, that the police officers got out to the public, praise God, some patriotic police officers got it out.
[02:43:49.991 --> 02:43:52.372]  By the way, Jack... Also a constitutionalist in there.
[02:43:52.673 --> 02:43:52.953]  Right.
[02:43:52.973 --> 02:43:53.974]  A domestic terrorist.
[02:43:54.254 --> 02:43:54.414]  Right.
[02:43:54.434 --> 02:43:55.855]  By the way, it didn't end with Clinton.
[02:43:55.895 --> 02:44:00.379]  Bush is putting them out nationwide that are even worse, that list land rights activists.
[02:44:01.119 --> 02:44:01.760]  Ah, okay.
[02:44:02.020 --> 02:44:02.240]  Yeah.
[02:44:02.260 --> 02:44:03.441]  And homeschoolers, right?
[02:44:04.031 --> 02:44:10.233]  Well, it mentioned right on that flyer, it mentioned supporters of the Constitution also was terrorists.
[02:44:10.553 --> 02:44:10.793]  That's right.
[02:44:10.813 --> 02:44:14.274]  And so you're saying that that was actually an FBI product?
[02:44:14.454 --> 02:44:14.975]  That's right.
[02:44:14.995 --> 02:44:16.875]  That was put out by the FBI.
[02:44:17.215 --> 02:44:22.137]  And Arpaio did not give him permission to use his sheriff's logo on that.
[02:44:22.417 --> 02:44:26.738]  Yeah, if you read carefully, it's an FBI task force phone number on there.
[02:44:27.118 --> 02:44:27.399]  Yeah.
[02:44:28.459 --> 02:44:31.660]  Arpaio got stuck with it as the fall guy, huh?
[02:44:32.262 --> 02:44:34.664]  Yes, he did, and he really got ticked.
[02:44:34.724 --> 02:44:41.449]  He's an old government agent, 33 years with DEA, and sadly, I've warned him about this.
[02:44:42.149 --> 02:44:46.953]  He keeps opening the doors and giving the keys to the city to the feds when they come in.
[02:44:47.853 --> 02:44:51.056]  And I told him, Joe, I said, you're a sheriff for the county now.
[02:44:51.116 --> 02:44:51.996]  You serve the people.
[02:44:52.037 --> 02:44:55.719]  You can't be a federal agent letting the feds run wild in this county here.
[02:44:57.304 --> 02:45:02.887]  But he keeps doing it, but he does have pink underwear and green baloney for the prisoners in his jail down there.
[02:45:03.727 --> 02:45:09.150]  Okay, well I'm glad to hear he's not really what that flyer portrays him as.
[02:45:09.230 --> 02:45:10.951]  You read carefully, it's a federal flyer.
[02:45:11.231 --> 02:45:12.071]  Yeah, okay.
[02:45:12.111 --> 02:45:19.055]  Alright, and then the next thing is, Alex, you probably already know about these two websites, or can I go ahead and mention two websites?
[02:45:19.673 --> 02:45:20.213]  Go ahead.
[02:45:20.613 --> 02:45:27.175]  No National ID, talking about the Real ID Act that was passed back in May of last year.
[02:45:27.275 --> 02:45:27.535]  Yes.
[02:45:27.975 --> 02:45:32.977]  And then also, which is against it, it explains... Right, what's the other website?
[02:45:32.997 --> 02:45:36.218]  I gotta... SPP, as in Sierra Papa Papa.
[02:45:36.458 --> 02:45:37.618]  SPP.gov.
[02:45:38.058 --> 02:45:39.739]  It is, I believe, a commerce...
[02:45:41.346 --> 02:45:41.966]  Hello, Alex.
[02:45:42.086 --> 02:45:42.486]  I'm Jack.
[02:46:05.848 --> 02:46:07.249]  Um, I'm waiting for my tape.
[02:46:07.309 --> 02:46:08.510]  I can't wait to get it.
[02:46:08.650 --> 02:46:09.791]  The, uh, terror storm.
[02:46:09.831 --> 02:46:11.192]  I'm waiting very patiently.
[02:46:11.212 --> 02:46:12.193]  Well, we're shipping out.
[02:46:12.313 --> 02:46:14.374]  Um, and thank you.
[02:46:14.394 --> 02:46:19.118]  Uh, I went through something with the police here not too long ago.
[02:46:19.738 --> 02:46:27.324]  And, um, they, I guess they think that I'm a terrorist because, uh, I took my children out of state and they said that I, um, kidnapped them.
[02:46:28.365 --> 02:46:31.327]  And, um, I was put in jail and they, um,
[02:46:32.452 --> 02:46:35.213]  They have like a, oh I don't know, I think it was a $100,000 bill.
[02:46:35.253 --> 02:46:45.957]  Well this happens all the time where people take their kids out for a week to go on vacation, they come back truancy officers that have been called, or are you divorced and just took them out of state to visit somebody and they called?
[02:46:46.678 --> 02:46:47.178]  That's right.
[02:46:47.378 --> 02:46:47.678]  Yeah.
[02:46:47.938 --> 02:46:48.739]  What happened?
[02:46:48.759 --> 02:46:49.359]  Which of the two?
[02:46:50.339 --> 02:46:50.899]  Which of the two?
[02:46:51.000 --> 02:46:52.000]  It was a divorce.
[02:46:52.400 --> 02:46:52.600]  Yeah.
[02:46:52.620 --> 02:46:53.481]  Divorce, pardon me.
[02:46:54.201 --> 02:46:57.002]  Okay, did you move out of state without talking to your ex-husband?
[02:46:58.636 --> 02:47:00.677]  No, we just went on vacation.
[02:47:00.777 --> 02:47:04.338]  Yeah, well, a lot of sneaky lawyers use that and they set people up.
[02:47:04.618 --> 02:47:11.260]  You need to go file a complaint on him criminally for filing a false report and you need to also civilly go after him.
[02:47:11.360 --> 02:47:12.921]  I mean, how long did you take your family out of town?
[02:47:14.521 --> 02:47:15.822]  Um, I think it was about two weeks.
[02:47:16.242 --> 02:47:16.982]  Did you tell him?
[02:47:18.443 --> 02:47:18.623]  No.
[02:47:19.423 --> 02:47:22.064]  Well, you need to, I mean, does he have any custody?
[02:47:24.015 --> 02:47:27.378]  We had, he got some kind of custody while I was gone.
[02:47:27.398 --> 02:47:30.560]  They ordered a show cause or something like that.
[02:47:30.580 --> 02:47:33.783]  Okay, well it sounds like you're being set up.
[02:47:33.863 --> 02:47:34.784]  Jack, you got any comments?
[02:47:35.464 --> 02:47:52.858]  Yes, it's a hard situation, but it's going on all across the nation, my dear, and get with, it is hard to find an attorney you trust, I know, but try to and get something going on that to come against him for doing this to you because
[02:47:53.559 --> 02:48:01.241]  It's a true crime to accuse you of kidnapping the children, very serious crime, when of course you were just on vacation.
[02:48:01.301 --> 02:48:06.683]  So I would follow Alex's advice and get started on that immediately.
[02:48:06.783 --> 02:48:08.784]  Had you gotten back to town when they arrested you?
[02:48:10.144 --> 02:48:11.465]  Yes, they arrested me.
[02:48:11.485 --> 02:48:18.767]  Well I mean, I would just go before the court and say no cause, drop it all, this is a complete joke, and demand a jury trial if not, and get up there and tell your story.
[02:48:18.807 --> 02:48:20.987]  I took my children out for vacation, came back and got arrested.
[02:48:22.328 --> 02:48:22.508]  Yes.
[02:48:23.223 --> 02:48:24.143]  Well, thank you very much.
[02:48:24.203 --> 02:48:25.044]  I appreciate it.
[02:48:25.224 --> 02:48:25.604]  Thank you.
[02:48:25.644 --> 02:48:26.965]  I'm sorry to hear that happen to you.
[02:48:27.225 --> 02:48:28.225]  Yeah, you gotta watch that.
[02:48:28.305 --> 02:48:34.128]  Sometime people who are mad in a divorce will wait till you go out of town and then set you up and file false charges.
[02:48:34.668 --> 02:48:37.369]  We'll come back, final segment, with Jack McClam to take a few more calls.
[02:48:37.750 --> 02:48:41.871]  He's got a new show here on Genesis, 7 o'clock at night central, 7 p.m.
[02:48:41.951 --> 02:48:42.792]  Jack McClam.
[02:48:46.634 --> 02:48:49.495]  What really happened September 11th and who stands to gain?
[02:48:50.220 --> 02:48:51.521]  Alex Jones here, America.
[02:48:51.721 --> 02:48:57.465]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest, most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[02:48:57.745 --> 02:49:02.988]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[02:49:03.288 --> 02:49:07.391]  Brace yourselves as the new world order program for world domination is blown wide open.
[02:49:07.611 --> 02:49:11.396]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world, where the military and the police are merged.
[02:49:11.636 --> 02:49:16.302]  Witnesses populations beg for national ID cards, and yes, even implantable microchips.
[02:49:16.382 --> 02:49:19.146]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies.
[02:49:19.446 --> 02:49:22.630]  Psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.
[02:49:22.690 --> 02:49:24.513]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.

[02:49:42.714 --> 02:49:44.797]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.
[02:49:46.443 --> 02:49:49.447]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[02:49:49.788 --> 02:49:58.619]  It's portable and requires no water pressure so you can enjoy healthy drinking water whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[02:49:58.940 --> 02:50:03.626]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[02:50:04.066 --> 02:50:10.788]  The Berkelot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[02:50:11.188 --> 02:50:22.951]  It also removes foul taste and odors, like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals, like lead and mercury, while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:50:23.451 --> 02:50:27.912]  The Murky Lights Rechargeable LED Lighting System is so bright it can be used as a reading light.

[02:50:47.014 --> 02:50:47.454]  Thank you.
[02:51:02.279 --> 02:51:02.960]  We're good to go!
[02:51:31.838 --> 02:51:34.920]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[02:51:35.081 --> 02:51:41.045]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective, natural alternatives and education.
[02:51:56.537 --> 02:51:58.638]  Jack McClam, I know you've covered this.
[02:51:58.658 --> 02:51:59.339]  I've heard your show.
[02:52:00.859 --> 02:52:01.800]  Read your writings on it.
[02:52:02.240 --> 02:52:08.566]  The land grabbing now, a lot of times, they don't even, county, city, federal, state, they don't even say it's for environmental reasons.
[02:52:08.586 --> 02:52:17.214]  They just say, we're taking it, we're not paying you for it, and if you fight us in court, we'll make up something and charge you for cleaning your property, you know, a million dollars.
[02:52:17.295 --> 02:52:23.721]  I mean, it's getting, the cases I see on a daily basis now are just out in the open corruption.
[02:52:24.021 --> 02:52:26.163]  So at the same time, people are waking up, Jack, but
[02:52:27.123 --> 02:52:30.624]  At the very same instance, the government's just going wildly corrupt.
[02:52:30.684 --> 02:52:31.224]  Why is that?
[02:52:31.605 --> 02:52:47.870]  Isn't that amazing, Alex, that the Supreme Court just came out with their decision a few months ago, just at the time when this NAFTA superhighway has to put through and take away hundreds of thousands of people's property to put in that superhighway.
[02:52:47.950 --> 02:52:49.931]  Isn't that amazing how that all came together?
[02:52:51.448 --> 02:52:57.532]  It is, and I see cases where they grab multi-million dollar pieces of property and just say, we're not paying you anything.
[02:52:58.453 --> 02:53:06.678]  Well, a lot of people are sure going to lose their property under this superhighway going in, brother, and so... By the way, there are 80 of them.
[02:53:08.479 --> 02:53:09.380]  80 what?
[02:53:09.400 --> 02:53:10.200]  80 superhighways.
[02:53:10.481 --> 02:53:12.042]  It's now on the official government website.
[02:53:12.382 --> 02:53:13.743]  Wow, I haven't seen that.
[02:53:13.823 --> 02:53:17.005]  I knew of the big one going up to Kansas City and then up to Canada.
[02:53:17.452 --> 02:53:19.033]  Now they've announced 80 of them.
[02:53:19.313 --> 02:53:21.494]  My goodness gracious, hadn't heard that yet.
[02:53:21.874 --> 02:53:25.296]  Yeah, it's a minor footnote in some of the mainstream news articles and one that Dacey did.
[02:53:25.316 --> 02:53:26.816]  We need to have a headline with that, yeah.
[02:53:27.236 --> 02:53:28.697]  Gee, my goodness gracious.
[02:53:28.797 --> 02:53:32.939]  Well, it's coming, folks, and the only thing that's going to stop it is people waking up.
[02:53:33.079 --> 02:53:35.100]  So, we're on the right course.
[02:53:35.540 --> 02:53:39.122]  We're on the field of battle against God's enemies and our enemies.
[02:53:40.000 --> 02:53:40.901]  We're winning, brother.
[02:53:40.941 --> 02:53:46.605]  We just have to get the people listening today to every day contact somebody.
[02:53:46.665 --> 02:53:48.587]  Get one of your tapes into their hands.
[02:53:49.087 --> 02:53:50.108]  Exactly.
[02:53:50.288 --> 02:53:52.830]  Get it in the hands or show it to their families.
[02:53:53.330 --> 02:53:54.771]  We're winning.
[02:53:54.791 --> 02:53:55.092]  We are.
[02:53:55.132 --> 02:53:56.373]  Let's try to jam a call in here.
[02:53:56.413 --> 02:53:56.813]  Okay.
[02:53:57.073 --> 02:53:58.254]  Let's go to Bill in Colorado.
[02:53:58.294 --> 02:53:59.635]  Bill in Colorado, you're on the air.
[02:53:59.675 --> 02:54:00.076]  Go ahead.
[02:54:04.659 --> 02:54:05.900]  He's there, but he's not listening.
[02:54:06.200 --> 02:54:07.541]  Let's go to Tim in Ohio.
[02:54:07.601 --> 02:54:08.222]  Tim, go ahead.
[02:54:09.841 --> 02:54:10.561]  Alex, how you doing?
[02:54:10.681 --> 02:54:10.941]  Good!
[02:54:11.622 --> 02:54:21.124]  I wanted to bring some information to the attention of your listeners that might help out in situations what you were talking about today, and that is the Civil Rights Act of 1871.
[02:54:22.025 --> 02:54:30.527]  People can find it if they research Title 42, Section 1983 of the United States Code, commonly referred to as just Section 1983.
[02:54:31.147 --> 02:54:36.669]  And in there, it provides that anyone who, under the color of state or local law,
[02:54:37.335 --> 02:54:44.062]  Causes a person to be deprived of their rights guaranteed by the Constitution or federal law is liable to that person civilly.
[02:54:44.483 --> 02:54:45.544]  So you can take them to court.
[02:54:45.704 --> 02:54:46.565]  You can take their house.
[02:54:46.585 --> 02:54:47.426]  You can take their car.
[02:54:47.466 --> 02:54:48.387]  You can take your pension.
[02:54:48.407 --> 02:54:53.553]  So all these bad cops out there that are doing the wrong things, this is where you go after them.
[02:54:53.613 --> 02:54:55.755]  It's the Civil Rights Act of 1871.
[02:54:58.180 --> 02:55:00.381]  I know that's been effective in the past.
[02:55:00.461 --> 02:55:01.542]  It still is in some extent.
[02:55:01.562 --> 02:55:02.823]  The courts are getting worse and worse.
[02:55:02.863 --> 02:55:06.785]  But instead of just going after the cops that come to grab your land, what about going after the mayor?
[02:55:06.825 --> 02:55:08.966]  What about going after the people that actually gave the orders?
[02:55:09.026 --> 02:55:09.586]  Jack McClam?
[02:55:10.007 --> 02:55:11.808]  Yes, very true.
[02:55:12.068 --> 02:55:17.431]  And I know cops that have lost their property under that law over the years.
[02:55:17.691 --> 02:55:26.896]  And so we need to hit the top guys and the city managers, the city, you know, the guys that gave the orders to take this property.
[02:55:27.429 --> 02:55:31.511]  And hit them hard with these suits, and they'll think twice about doing that.
[02:55:31.871 --> 02:55:32.711]  Take their stuff away.
[02:55:32.951 --> 02:55:36.993]  And hit the cops while you're at it, it's just better to go after the kingpins, it's better to go after the dons.
[02:55:37.313 --> 02:55:41.494]  Yeah, the police chief, the mayors, and the city council.
[02:55:41.754 --> 02:55:43.375]  Yeah, thank you Jim.
[02:55:44.159 --> 02:55:45.200]  We're flat out of time.
[02:55:45.320 --> 02:55:52.425]  Jack McClam, I want to thank you for joining us and I'm excited that in the last month you've joined the GCN Radio Network weeknights at 7 p.m.
[02:55:52.885 --> 02:55:54.546]  Central and I'll be tuned in.
[02:55:54.866 --> 02:55:55.807]  God bless you, my friend.
[02:55:56.367 --> 02:55:58.849]  Okay, brother, and thanks for all you do for so many.
[02:55:58.929 --> 02:56:06.094]  We love you, Alex, and many cops and soldiers listening and reading your, or listening and watching your tape, so thank you, brother.
[02:56:06.658 --> 02:56:07.399]  Well, thank you, Jack.
[02:56:07.419 --> 02:56:07.819]  God bless.
[02:56:07.859 --> 02:56:08.359]  Godspeed.
[02:56:08.459 --> 02:56:08.720]  All right.
[02:56:08.740 --> 02:56:11.802]  We'll be back tonight, 9 to midnight Central Standard Time.
[02:56:11.862 --> 02:56:13.183]  Back tomorrow, 11 to 2.

[02:56:15.725 --> 02:56:16.485]  That's all I'm going to tell you.
[02:56:16.945 --> 02:56:18.466]  Huge guests coming up this week.
[02:56:19.087 --> 02:56:19.507]  All right.
[02:56:19.687 --> 02:56:21.489]  Now get out there and take on the New World Order.
[02:56:21.569 --> 02:56:22.649]  God bless you all.
