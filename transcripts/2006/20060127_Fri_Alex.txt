[00:00:05.773 --> 00:00:06.414]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.074 --> 00:00:08.114]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.834 --> 00:00:09.954]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.614 --> 00:00:11.415]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.175 --> 00:00:13.075]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.735 --> 00:00:17.436]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.916 --> 00:00:22.037]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:25.898 --> 00:00:27.498]  Back in the saddle again!
[00:00:28.527 --> 00:00:50.400]  27th day of January 2006 wow the first month of the new year is almost elapsed to be eclipsed by February a lot of talk show hosts will take off two three weeks in a row and I guess the last four or five years I've taken off a week here a week there I didn't really take off during the Christmas holiday season
[00:00:51.169 --> 00:00:52.410]  I am honored to be your talk show host.
[00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:56.312]  We're going to be here live for the next three hours and we're going to have wide open telephones.
[00:01:07.629 --> 00:01:25.382]  I obviously could have had a whole plethora of important guests on with very important information today, but I'm only having one guest on in the third hour concerning the NSA and the Pentagon spying on groups in Houston that protest against Halliburton.
[00:01:27.581 --> 00:01:36.127]  Protesting against very corrupt, known to be extremely corrupt defense contractors gets the government spying on you.
[00:01:36.548 --> 00:01:43.773]  All part of the new freedom, because anything that can hurt the war effort, why it aids Al Qaeda, hence it is terrorism.
[00:01:44.665 --> 00:01:47.348]  So that's coming up in the third hour.
[00:01:47.368 --> 00:01:52.592]  I do plan, I say this quite often and then don't really deliver on it, but some days I do.
[00:01:52.973 --> 00:01:56.916]  I do plan to take a lot of your calls in this first hour and in the second hour today.
[00:01:56.936 --> 00:01:56.996]  1-800-259-9231
[00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:02.209]  Real Talk Radio!
[00:02:19.322 --> 00:02:25.366]  Actually happening, but our listeners do have a grasp of it, and that's why I always enjoy hearing from you and talking to you.
[00:02:25.766 --> 00:02:40.956]  Any news item you'd like to discuss, any guests that you think you'd like to hear on the show, or any comments by past guests you'd like to elaborate on, any questions you have, a lot of times I can answer, or at least give you a partial answer.
[00:02:43.251 --> 00:02:43.311]  259-9231.
[00:02:43.331 --> 00:02:45.435]  Lawmakers say they will press Bush on spying.
[00:02:45.575 --> 00:02:46.436]  That's in the AP.
[00:02:51.750 --> 00:03:00.636]  And what the lawmakers really do is claim they're going to press, and then whitewash, and actually end up promoting whatever the new abomination of the Bill of Rights and Constitution is.
[00:03:01.196 --> 00:03:05.139]  And I know that from the particular individuals that are saying this.
[00:03:05.219 --> 00:03:07.741]  It's all part of how they try to gain some credibility.
[00:03:07.781 --> 00:03:15.426]  Oh look, we have a champion for freedom, and at the end of it, well I guess we do need an emperor, like Arlen Specter is now saying.
[00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.061]  Joe Lieberman, U.S.
[00:03:18.102 --> 00:03:21.865]  prepared for Iran strike, and they may go ahead with that any time now.
[00:03:22.725 --> 00:03:23.426]  Very interesting.
[00:03:23.686 --> 00:03:28.970]  China to build world's first artificial sun with an experimental device.
[00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:32.213]  And I read this science article, and it's... What are they talking about?
[00:03:32.233 --> 00:03:38.218]  They've had fission fusion reactors and been doing that for 30 years that it's been declassified.
[00:03:38.298 --> 00:03:39.859]  More than 30 years.
[00:03:39.939 --> 00:03:44.783]  But I guess if China announces they're going to be the first to do it, then it just must be true.
[00:03:46.084 --> 00:03:51.566]  By the way, I know this has been talked to death while I was gone, but I have some own comments on it, because it's going on right here in the U.S.
[00:03:51.586 --> 00:03:52.767]  Don't make any mistake about it.
[00:03:53.247 --> 00:03:53.547]  U.S.
[00:03:53.607 --> 00:03:57.168]  Congressman is taking Google to task on China censorship.
[00:03:57.188 --> 00:04:01.110]  Of course, Google is to censor sensitive terms in China.
[00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:07.212]  Things that criticize mass executions, or mobile execution vans, or torture, or the slave camps.
[00:04:08.038 --> 00:04:15.262]  And by the way, our own media does that here, and a lot of the big search engines have been caught doing that here, and I'm blocked out of most libraries, most universities.
[00:04:15.883 --> 00:04:21.346]  We're blocked, and you go to InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, and we've been reporting on this for years.
[00:04:21.406 --> 00:04:22.667]  It's been admitted in many cases.
[00:04:22.727 --> 00:04:24.448]  We are officially blocked all over.
[00:04:24.868 --> 00:04:26.549]  Much of the filtering software blocks us.
[00:04:27.435 --> 00:04:32.360]  If you go to Infowars.com on your lunch hour at Dell Computers, you're instantly fired.
[00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:38.445]  I've interviewed and talked to eight separate people, some of them personal friends of mine, who are instantly fired.
[00:04:38.465 --> 00:04:40.427]  It's all part of the new freedom.
[00:04:40.547 --> 00:04:44.030]  So why are we talking about China?
[00:04:44.611 --> 00:04:50.176]  I mean, let's talk about where it's really going on, but we're accustomed to it.
[00:04:51.215 --> 00:04:55.857]  And there's just masses of key news and information coming up I haven't even mentioned yet.
[00:04:56.317 --> 00:04:57.198]  You'll want to stay with us.
[00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:05.502]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[00:05:05.742 --> 00:05:07.322]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[00:05:07.663 --> 00:05:12.345]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[00:05:12.685 --> 00:05:19.388]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[00:05:19.728 --> 00:05:21.710]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has arisen.
[00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:24.772]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[00:05:24.852 --> 00:05:29.515]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[00:05:29.716 --> 00:05:34.119]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[00:05:34.379 --> 00:05:41.604]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[00:05:41.845 --> 00:05:44.266]  Discover the documentary for yourself before it's too late.

[00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:04.342]  The War on Terrorism.
[00:06:04.662 --> 00:06:07.446]  Will it be fought overseas, or will it affect us here at home?
[00:06:07.727 --> 00:06:11.893]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[00:06:12.313 --> 00:06:13.134]  So what do you do?
[00:06:13.455 --> 00:06:18.042]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[00:06:18.502 --> 00:06:20.643]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[00:06:21.123 --> 00:06:35.826]  Sheltering in Place, Surviving Acts of Terrorism from Biological, Chemical, and Radioactive Fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:06:35.866 --> 00:06:42.908]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.

[00:07:02.893 --> 00:07:05.557]  Is your quality of life reduced because of health problems?
[00:07:05.777 --> 00:07:07.579]  Are you starting to feel the signs of aging?
[00:07:07.739 --> 00:07:11.764]  Are you relatively healthy but wonder if you can do more to maintain proper health?
[00:07:11.965 --> 00:07:13.326]  Now there's Stem Enhance.
[00:07:13.727 --> 00:07:18.333]  Stem Enhance is a new product category of phytonutrients that help in renewing your body.
[00:07:18.573 --> 00:07:24.378]  Stem Enhance's natural ingredients help to support the release of stem cells from your bone marrow into your bloodstream.
[00:07:24.558 --> 00:07:36.027]  Through a natural process, those stem cells have the amazing ability to transform into any type of cell in the body, like heart cells, brain cells, liver cells, can all be generated from this powerful building block.
[00:07:36.287 --> 00:07:44.874]  Thousands of people who use Stem Enhance have reported spectacular results, experiencing everything from an increase in energy in just a few days to an improvement in
[00:07:44.974 --> 00:07:48.295]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:07:48.395 --> 00:07:50.155]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:11.610 --> 00:08:18.039]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:08:18.099 --> 00:08:24.527]  We're eight minutes, seventeen seconds into the second segment now of this live Friday edition.
[00:08:24.828 --> 00:08:25.949]  Feels like Monday, though.
[00:08:25.969 --> 00:08:28.673]  Again, I took off five shows, Friday through Thursday.
[00:08:29.757 --> 00:08:35.958]  I haven't really done that in a long, long time, but I've got to do it occasionally to spend time with the family, so I do not apologize.
[00:08:36.278 --> 00:08:40.619]  We had a great individual, Jack Blood, sitting in for us for three of those days, two of the days.
[00:08:40.939 --> 00:08:43.160]  We did rebroadcast of some of our better shows.
[00:08:43.180 --> 00:08:56.663]  I want to say hi to all of our MNFM affiliates out there, shortwave affiliate as well, Global Satellite, and of course you can always listen to us on the internet at InfoWars.com, InfoWars.net, PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:09:00.673 --> 00:09:01.775]  Why four sites?
[00:09:01.835 --> 00:09:04.318]  Well, four different webmasters.
[00:09:04.418 --> 00:09:16.391]  Most of the news you see on the sites is the same as the others, but a lot of the sites, every single day, in fact all the sites have exclusive news, exclusive documents, exclusive photos, exclusive video clips to them
[00:09:17.172 --> 00:09:31.836]  And it also gives us a redundancy so that when we get denial of service attacks directly from the Pentagon, or we have servers taken down, or we have problems, we have multiple backups and heavily trafficked sites that people can just shift over to.
[00:09:31.896 --> 00:09:46.620]  Those are what are more commonly known as mirror sites, but we've taken it one step further and just made them independent information warfare vessels in the fight for this civilization, for liberty and freedom.
[00:09:48.647 --> 00:09:51.249]  Now, coming up in the third hour, let me just mention this now.
[00:09:51.349 --> 00:10:00.194]  Pentagon spied on Houston anti-Halliburton activists, and this was in both of the Houston newspapers.
[00:10:03.095 --> 00:10:15.539]  A Houston-based anti-Halliburton group was spied on by a top-secret Pentagon counterintelligence agency in 2004, now been leaked, according to a report in Newsweek magazine.
[00:10:15.979 --> 00:10:19.681]  The peaceful protest, organized by Houston Global Awareness on June 29,
[00:10:20.931 --> 00:10:22.773]  Wasn't even protesting the war.
[00:10:23.193 --> 00:10:35.506]  They were against wasteful spending and the fact that Halliburton had even admitted and pled guilty to feeding substandard and even rotten meals to their own contractors, their own workers.
[00:10:35.546 --> 00:10:40.011]  The protest involved handing out peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.
[00:10:40.412 --> 00:10:42.133]  Very Al Qaeda-esque.
[00:10:42.173 --> 00:10:43.415]  It is incredibly evil, folks.
[00:10:43.855 --> 00:10:54.999]  To employees of the giant military contractor, Halliburton, to draw attention to allegations that the company overcharged for military food contracts in Iraq.
[00:10:56.320 --> 00:11:11.245]  And of course, Newsweek, and it's been picked up by the Houston Papers as I mentioned earlier, reported on how the Pentagon's counterintelligence field activity, CIFA, filed a report on the Houston protests which took place outside Halliburton's headquarters in H-Town.
[00:11:12.336 --> 00:11:12.516]  No.
[00:11:13.017 --> 00:11:15.279]  And it goes on to talk about how it's happened all over the country.
[00:11:15.319 --> 00:11:17.140]  There are literally hundreds of these.
[00:11:17.841 --> 00:11:23.686]  Folks, I've been at Second Amendment demonstrations for the Second Amendment, which you'd call conservative.
[00:11:23.826 --> 00:11:31.392]  I have been at demonstrations against the Ku Klux Klan, which you would call liberal, or just normal is what I would call it.
[00:11:31.673 --> 00:11:33.274]  And I've had these types out there.
[00:11:33.334 --> 00:11:37.678]  We have been at military training drills that are in our cities, not even near bases.
[00:11:38.878 --> 00:11:46.579]  And had them walk over and try to get cops to arrest us and to finger us, poke us in the chest, and to finger us to police.
[00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:49.522]  And you've seen the video of that in the films.
[00:11:49.542 --> 00:11:52.264]  It hasn't just happened to me, it's happened to others that have sent us the video.
[00:11:52.564 --> 00:11:59.130]  From Hebron, Maryland, to Oakland, California, to Belton, Texas, to Kingsville, Texas, to San Antonio, Texas.
[00:11:59.510 --> 00:12:05.835]  You know, one day we're in the police chief's office, you know, and they tried to bribe me, and I was former military or army intelligence myself.
[00:12:05.855 --> 00:12:14.583]  I'm not against military, Alex, but they tried to bribe us with big sackfuls of cash, and they fired into an all-nighter restaurant in Miami and crashed a helicopter in Houston.
[00:12:14.623 --> 00:12:15.584]  We can see it in Police State 2000.
[00:12:16.862 --> 00:12:18.883]  So I told them no, and they kept coming.
[00:12:19.843 --> 00:12:21.703]  So again, even the police chief was against it.
[00:12:21.723 --> 00:12:23.924]  It's not like I'm some wild-eyed person out here.
[00:12:24.304 --> 00:12:26.685]  Though I guess we all should be pretty wild-eyed over what's happening.
[00:12:27.725 --> 00:12:31.986]  They walk over with guns, get us down on the ground, take our tape, erase it, and give it back to us.
[00:12:32.046 --> 00:12:34.167]  I mean, this is America, folks!
[00:12:34.607 --> 00:12:41.729]  So I hear about people out giving out peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, and they've got troops photographing them, and sneaking around.
[00:12:41.769 --> 00:12:42.849]  I mean, this is America!
[00:12:44.222 --> 00:12:48.666]  In the late 80s, there was a secret program that was started for gun confiscation nationwide.
[00:12:48.686 --> 00:12:52.829]  You've all heard about how they do the questionnaires and how they prepared the military for it.
[00:12:52.869 --> 00:12:53.750]  I mean, that's real.
[00:12:54.271 --> 00:12:55.011]  This is real.
[00:12:55.051 --> 00:12:56.232]  Nothing to do with Al Qaeda.
[00:12:57.734 --> 00:13:01.817]  This entire military-industrial complex is not free market.
[00:13:02.745 --> 00:13:10.993]  It goes out and creates enemies, the best enemies money can buy, or as a racket, as Brigadier General Smedley Butler said in the book he wrote, exposing it.
[00:13:11.393 --> 00:13:16.438]  They asked him to have a coup d'etat, to take over the Congress, to declare martial law.
[00:13:16.838 --> 00:13:19.861]  And he wrote a book about it and went public and even testified to Congress.
[00:13:20.161 --> 00:13:24.926]  That isn't taught in the history books anymore, even though that was just 70-something years ago.
[00:13:26.027 --> 00:13:28.469]  Side issue, I'm digressing here.
[00:13:29.193 --> 00:13:39.268]  This entire war on terror is pointed at you, whether you're black, hispanic, white, whether you're a rancher in East Texas, or a steel worker in Pennsylvania.
[00:13:40.305 --> 00:13:47.493]  It doesn't matter whether you're an oil refinery worker in Corpus Christi, Texas, or you're a school teacher in Kansas City, Missouri.
[00:13:48.014 --> 00:13:50.636]  This whole thing is pointed at you.
[00:13:50.657 --> 00:13:59.066]  This whole control grid that they're putting in is admittedly by the Pentagon, I mean it's even an MIT magazine, to control you.
[00:14:00.439 --> 00:14:06.865]  The propaganda in the news is just to salve you, to neutralize you until it's too late.
[00:14:06.905 --> 00:14:08.567]  You can wake up now and stop this.
[00:14:09.107 --> 00:14:17.635]  But all of the diversions, and the distractions, and the gladiatorial events, and the movie stars, and this worship of Madison Avenue...
[00:14:18.599 --> 00:14:32.525]  And the spin machine and the PR machines is all to just keep you basically confused while this classical control grid goes into place with a super 21st century high-tech overlay.
[00:14:34.185 --> 00:14:36.866]  The war on terror is a war on freedom.
[00:14:36.906 --> 00:14:39.167]  The war on terror is a war on dissent.
[00:14:39.627 --> 00:14:41.848]  The war on terror doesn't keep you safe.
[00:14:42.108 --> 00:14:43.329]  We've had a war on drugs.
[00:14:44.022 --> 00:14:48.323]  And the bigger the war on drugs gets, the more drugs are on our streets, the more people are in prison.
[00:14:48.363 --> 00:14:49.663]  Did you know that's their own statistics?
[00:14:49.683 --> 00:14:50.603]  The Fed's own statistics?
[00:14:51.263 --> 00:14:56.084]  Again, 12 years ago, how much cocaine and heroin was coming into the country?
[00:14:56.644 --> 00:15:02.105]  Well, there's now double the heroin, excuse me, triple the heroin and double the cocaine coming into the country.
[00:15:02.385 --> 00:15:07.266]  And we've gone from 1 million in the prison system to now over 7 million in the system.
[00:15:07.486 --> 00:15:09.266]  And there's more drugs on the street than ever before.
[00:15:09.326 --> 00:15:11.787]  Again, the war on terror is a great success.
[00:15:12.467 --> 00:15:13.048]  You know what I mean?
[00:15:13.088 --> 00:15:13.649]  It's failing.
[00:15:13.669 --> 00:15:15.191]  You just said there's more coming in.
[00:15:16.353 --> 00:15:17.214]  Don't you understand?
[00:15:17.515 --> 00:15:19.057]  It's public knowledge.
[00:15:19.137 --> 00:15:26.788]  It's an open secret that the big defense contractors and the private banks around them openly bring in the lion's share of the narcotics.
[00:15:27.486 --> 00:15:40.049]  And then they openly own the controlling shares in the big pharmacological companies that push the drugs legally on you, when in some cases they are the exact same molecule, except for one or two little changes.
[00:15:40.369 --> 00:15:50.111]  And so they'll put your kid in jail for 10 years for using methamphetamine, and in everybody's houses, but then they will force your kid on to Ritalin, which is almost identical.
[00:15:51.632 --> 00:15:54.853]  In fact, in a lot of different studies, it shows it's even more dangerous.
[00:15:54.873 --> 00:15:56.313]  You know, speed kills.
[00:15:58.001 --> 00:16:03.286]  So giving up liberty doesn't give you security, it gives you tyranny.
[00:16:04.688 --> 00:16:05.568]  Is that America?
[00:16:05.609 --> 00:16:11.855]  You're out handing out peanut butter and jelly sandwiches saying you've been ripped off and so the Pentagon's sneaking around watching you?
[00:16:13.529 --> 00:16:15.630]  And why is the media now announcing all this?
[00:16:15.970 --> 00:16:20.053]  You've never heard this on any other show but this one until, like, the last year.
[00:16:20.073 --> 00:16:25.075]  I mean, even so-called patriot talk shows and libertarian talk shows never talked about this.
[00:16:25.595 --> 00:16:34.400]  You didn't talk about it because the mainstream media didn't talk about it, and all you're supposed to do is regurgitate what they talk about, and then somehow that makes you kosher and safe and okay.
[00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:36.361]  Well, you know, we don't do that here.
[00:16:37.435 --> 00:16:38.496]  We are on the cutting edge.
[00:16:38.536 --> 00:16:40.238]  We understand the program of control.
[00:16:40.298 --> 00:16:43.481]  That's why everything we quote talked about has now come true.
[00:16:44.041 --> 00:16:45.282]  Because it was already true.
[00:16:45.322 --> 00:16:46.343]  It didn't come true.
[00:16:46.423 --> 00:16:47.244]  It was true.
[00:16:48.085 --> 00:16:50.207]  Alex Jones, how did everything he say come true?
[00:16:50.247 --> 00:16:51.868]  Is he an agent?
[00:16:51.888 --> 00:16:52.549]  How does he know?
[00:16:52.569 --> 00:16:53.269]  How did he know?
[00:16:53.289 --> 00:16:55.311]  It was all in federal documents.
[00:16:55.351 --> 00:16:56.212]  It was all public.
[00:16:56.372 --> 00:16:57.413]  I experienced it.
[00:16:57.753 --> 00:16:58.394]  I've lived it.
[00:16:58.654 --> 00:16:59.375]  I've been through it.
[00:16:59.395 --> 00:17:00.536]  And I'm not tooting my horn.
[00:17:01.056 --> 00:17:05.560]  When I get on the air and say that the Global Crime Syndicate is bigger than our government.
[00:17:05.580 --> 00:17:07.001]  When I say our government, that's really wrong.
[00:17:07.461 --> 00:17:09.343]  But it controls our government, so it's the same thing.
[00:17:10.323 --> 00:17:19.811]  We'll probably carry out nuke attacks in this country, or bio-attacks, unless we expose that they're behind it and totally engineer us into a full-bore martial law police state.
[00:17:21.391 --> 00:17:24.855]  And that their open plan is to take your pension funds and take your private property.
[00:17:24.875 --> 00:17:27.438]  I mean, they've changed the laws where they can do that.
[00:17:27.878 --> 00:17:28.839]  It doesn't make it lawful.
[00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:31.242]  You can again change the law saying black people aren't humans.
[00:17:32.383 --> 00:17:33.565]  You don't have to follow that law.
[00:17:33.605 --> 00:17:36.608]  If Hitler says kill all the Jews, you don't have to follow that.
[00:17:36.648 --> 00:17:37.749]  It's a criminal law.
[00:17:38.911 --> 00:17:40.753]  Regardless, they are changing the law!
[00:17:42.941 --> 00:17:45.163]  I mean, sure, they had torture schools 30 years ago.
[00:17:45.203 --> 00:17:47.104]  Sure, they were torturing kids 30 years ago.
[00:17:47.625 --> 00:17:51.247]  That was to create the cadres to today have the big rollout.
[00:17:51.328 --> 00:17:52.408]  This is the rollout.
[00:17:52.709 --> 00:17:54.070]  This is the sales pitch.
[00:17:54.450 --> 00:17:56.672]  Everything you're seeing is the sales pitch.
[00:17:56.912 --> 00:17:58.853]  The acclimation, the conditioning.
[00:17:59.094 --> 00:18:00.975]  You're being prepared for slavery.
[00:18:01.195 --> 00:18:04.638]  You're being shod with the ball and chain.
[00:18:07.762 --> 00:18:09.383]  I mean, look at the news I have in front of me.
[00:18:10.003 --> 00:18:11.124]  And this is a daily basis.
[00:18:11.664 --> 00:18:11.964]  U.S.
[00:18:12.104 --> 00:18:13.045]  outsource torture.
[00:18:14.246 --> 00:18:18.868]  Admitted to the former Soviet Union, a block, to the gulags.
[00:18:20.129 --> 00:18:22.010]  We always say, where are the camps going to be?
[00:18:22.050 --> 00:18:24.531]  Well, we got it from the intel.
[00:18:24.671 --> 00:18:25.972]  Again, they're going to fly you overseas.
[00:18:26.332 --> 00:18:28.073]  Listen to that nut, Alex Jones.
[00:18:28.353 --> 00:18:30.814]  They're going to fly us overseas.
[00:18:31.655 --> 00:18:34.036]  Well, a lot of them will just be to Guantanamo or Alaska.
[00:18:34.056 --> 00:18:35.457]  The really big camps are in Alaska.
[00:18:35.937 --> 00:18:43.422]  And folks, they got thousands of jail guards who've been caught raping and torturing in the federal prisons and state prisons, and it's even admitted.
[00:18:43.702 --> 00:18:52.487]  We told you they were recruiting out of there with people that have crimes in their dossiers, and now, just like Stalin did, now it's mainstream news.
[00:18:52.847 --> 00:18:56.950]  The Pentagon goes and finds criminals, slaps
[00:18:57.971 --> 00:19:25.669]  sergeant bars on their uniforms and and and and literally doesn't matter to pass any physicals nothing they can wait four hundred pounds and i mean they put beast men in there and imagine these families a lot of little kids being raped in front of them while some hippopotamus does it i mean you know this is america folks look listen to this officer doc pay for torturing iraqi to death chief warrant officer lewis uh... welsh for
[00:19:27.145 --> 00:19:29.206]  If I'm pronouncing that right, Welsh offer.
[00:19:29.547 --> 00:19:30.447]  The highest ranking U.S.
[00:19:30.527 --> 00:19:39.673]  Army official charged to date in the death of an Iraqi detainee was convicted of negligent homicide on Saturday after it dictated the death was not murder.
[00:19:40.554 --> 00:19:54.483]  And it says that following a broader Army guidelines, torture of an Iraqi general named Abed Hamid Malhorsh by covering his mouth and placing him head first into a sleeping bag and sitting on his chest during an interrogation.
[00:19:54.883 --> 00:19:55.524]  And they said that
[00:19:56.630 --> 00:19:57.471]  He's allowed to do that.
[00:19:57.511 --> 00:20:00.372]  We'll be right back.
[00:20:01.573 --> 00:20:03.174]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:20:03.555 --> 00:20:09.298]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[00:20:09.538 --> 00:20:14.682]  The Berkey Light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[00:20:15.022 --> 00:20:24.288]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, trihalomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.
[00:20:24.648 --> 00:20:29.610]  It's rechargeable 8-lamp bright white LED lighting system provides the ideal source of emergency light.
[00:20:29.910 --> 00:20:33.932]  The lights can run all night on a single charge and it is bright enough to read by.
[00:20:34.132 --> 00:20:38.874]  This provides a relaxing and ambient night light that allows for optimum use during emergency conditions.
[00:20:39.314 --> 00:20:45.176]  Emergency Lights' revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.

[00:21:05.405 --> 00:21:09.909]  Did you know there's a secret group that wants the government to spend itself in the bankruptcy?
[00:21:10.430 --> 00:21:16.676]  Did you know that current President Bush has the largest percentage of increase in spending than any Democrat has ever had?
[00:21:17.416 --> 00:21:17.956]  We're good to go.
[00:21:33.865 --> 00:21:34.025]  516-8736.

[00:22:02.066 --> 00:22:05.969]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt.
[00:22:06.189 --> 00:22:18.479]  But the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999, reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking 10.57% annual increase, outpacing its previous 10 years.
[00:22:18.899 --> 00:22:19.299]  The U.S.
[00:22:19.339 --> 00:22:24.924]  economy receives its currency by taking on debt through a private banking institution called the Federal Reserve System.
[00:22:25.324 --> 00:22:27.526]  In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%.
[00:22:29.387 --> 00:22:30.449]  It's bad enough that the U.S.
[00:22:30.469 --> 00:22:33.332]  citizens is bound by debt in order to have commerce.
[00:22:33.452 --> 00:22:39.479]  However, shocking the economy with the reduction of this magnitude could wipe out years of growth in a stock portfolio.
[00:22:39.899 --> 00:22:43.263]  Before you make your next investment decision, get the cold hard facts.

[00:23:56.588 --> 00:24:10.012]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:24:10.032 --> 00:24:13.533]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:15.805 --> 00:24:21.889]  By the way, I don't want to hear that this torture is because we've got to fight and win the war on terror.
[00:24:23.690 --> 00:24:35.659]  Everybody's freaking out over the fact that Hamas won the election with 70 plus of the seats, with the PLO only getting about 40, there in Palestine.
[00:24:36.693 --> 00:24:40.477]  Well just type in Israel founded Hamas or Israel funds Hamas.
[00:24:40.497 --> 00:24:43.801]  You won't get the evil Alex Jones website InfoWars.com.
[00:24:44.162 --> 00:24:46.885]  You'll get Haratz, that's the big Israeli Jewish newspaper.
[00:24:46.925 --> 00:24:48.206]  You'll get Jerusalem Post.
[00:24:48.767 --> 00:24:50.329]  Because they did in 1973, Israel founded Hamas.
[00:24:54.483 --> 00:24:56.204]  Did you know, just type in U.S.
[00:24:56.284 --> 00:24:59.606]  Government founded modern Wuhadish?
[00:25:00.286 --> 00:25:02.407]  Or type in Nazi Muslims?
[00:25:02.828 --> 00:25:04.689]  You have the Muslims that helped Hitler?
[00:25:04.729 --> 00:25:08.451]  Our government came in and said after World War II, oh yes, we're going to put you in charge.
[00:25:08.711 --> 00:25:14.594]  And then printed up millions up until 2001, and that's been in the Washington Post, of radical
[00:25:15.547 --> 00:25:18.749]  Islamists' tracks saying, kill Americans!
[00:25:19.349 --> 00:25:20.150]  Kill them!
[00:25:20.330 --> 00:25:20.890]  Bomb them!
[00:25:21.431 --> 00:25:23.392]  Millions and millions and millions.
[00:25:23.432 --> 00:25:27.474]  Well, when it came out in 2001, it had been several million the year before.
[00:25:27.514 --> 00:25:28.475]  So, millions a year.
[00:25:28.515 --> 00:25:30.536]  Let's get the full magnitude.
[00:25:30.556 --> 00:25:34.678]  So, I don't want to hear about the radical jihadists.
[00:25:35.319 --> 00:25:37.160]  Of course they're going to get you.
[00:25:37.240 --> 00:25:38.401]  They work for the globalists.
[00:25:38.881 --> 00:25:42.223]  And most of them at the low level don't even have an inkling that they do.
[00:25:42.978 --> 00:25:49.841]  You tell the average person that the Ayatollah Khomeini clearly was CIA controlled, they're going to just laugh at you.
[00:25:50.382 --> 00:25:52.803]  Because they don't know history.
[00:25:52.863 --> 00:25:56.865]  They don't know that our own government admittedly declassified.
[00:25:56.885 --> 00:25:57.465]  This is public.
[00:25:57.505 --> 00:25:58.606]  This isn't even questioned.
[00:25:58.626 --> 00:25:59.346]  This is public.
[00:25:59.766 --> 00:26:02.368]  Carried out terror attacks in Iran to remove Mosaddegh.
[00:26:03.248 --> 00:26:04.349]  And they put the Shah in.
[00:26:04.829 --> 00:26:06.890]  And he was suddenly not completely playing ball.
[00:26:06.910 --> 00:26:10.812]  And they found out he'd been Swiss bank accounting some of the BP money, British Petroleum.
[00:26:11.926 --> 00:26:20.589]  And so suddenly there's this big overthrow and they go grab all these Americans, and the whole time the CIA is in contact with them and do not release them.
[00:26:20.609 --> 00:26:26.291]  And the moment Jimmy Carter is defeated, they remove Jimmy Carter, in comes Ronald Reagan, and that day they're released.
[00:26:26.551 --> 00:26:28.231]  And then it's declassified, been in the Senate.
[00:26:28.811 --> 00:26:35.113]  Tow missiles, hundreds of millions in cash, all these other goodies go right to the Ayatollah Khamenei.
[00:26:35.714 --> 00:26:40.155]  Not only did they bring him to power, fly him in from Paris,
[00:26:41.367 --> 00:26:49.109]  Again, you tell the average person, bin Laden's known CIA, admit it public, they just don't know it, don't care.
[00:26:50.049 --> 00:26:54.831]  You tell the average adult that the Ayatollah Khomeini was globalist-controlled, they just don't get it.
[00:26:55.691 --> 00:27:05.514]  I told people years ago, because of all the expert guests we've had on about it, that the six so-called oligarchs of Russia, six men, when it fell overnight back in 1991, wink-wink,
[00:27:08.115 --> 00:27:16.712]  Six men suddenly were just able to get the whole government to hand them over the entire industry of the country.
[00:27:16.832 --> 00:27:17.434]  Six men!
[00:27:18.169 --> 00:27:21.290]  And now three of them have gone to jail when, quote, Putin gets mad at them.
[00:27:21.890 --> 00:27:27.833]  But it turns out that really, that they weren't following orders, that they weren't doing what they were supposed to.
[00:27:28.133 --> 00:27:30.614]  And you can actually find it in the London Telegraph, London Independent.
[00:27:30.814 --> 00:27:38.497]  It'll be little blurbs about, oh, but when Putin arrested him, Putin didn't give any of the assets because Lord Rothschild really owned the company.
[00:27:39.632 --> 00:27:44.135]  Oh, Russia falls, but really it was all owned by Lord Rothschild?
[00:27:44.655 --> 00:27:52.960]  And then years later, whenever an oligarch gets killed or gets arrested, oh, it doesn't matter, none of the assets are going back to the government because it's all owned by Lord Rothschild.
[00:27:53.678 --> 00:27:55.719]  Or in one case, the Dutch Royal Family.
[00:27:55.939 --> 00:28:01.341]  Lord Rothschild, the British Royal Family, Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, it's in all the financial papers.
[00:28:01.641 --> 00:28:03.382]  Who do you think owns the cruise lines?
[00:28:03.402 --> 00:28:05.163]  Who do you think owns the oil companies?
[00:28:05.323 --> 00:28:07.644]  Who do you think owns the big stock in Toyota?
[00:28:07.884 --> 00:28:10.745]  Who do you think owns the controlling stock in defense contractors?
[00:28:11.046 --> 00:28:15.587]  Do you know who owns some of the controlling stock, say, in Lockheed Martin or Carmile Group?
[00:28:15.908 --> 00:28:16.268]  Yes!
[00:28:16.768 --> 00:28:17.648]  Queen of England, yeah.
[00:28:18.769 --> 00:28:21.290]  Just type in Queen Elizabeth
[00:28:22.136 --> 00:28:22.496]  What is she?
[00:28:22.516 --> 00:28:23.376]  Queen Elizabeth the third?
[00:28:23.416 --> 00:28:23.776]  I forget.
[00:28:24.097 --> 00:28:26.437]  Queen Elizabeth, Carlisle group.
[00:28:26.457 --> 00:28:27.438]  You'll get Reuters.
[00:28:27.998 --> 00:28:28.878]  She's the majority owner.
[00:28:29.378 --> 00:28:32.319]  Guess who else owns the next two largest stock blocks?
[00:28:33.279 --> 00:28:34.660]  The House of Bin Laden.
[00:28:35.320 --> 00:28:37.160]  Yes, they do.
[00:28:37.620 --> 00:28:40.661]  Queen of England, House of Bin Laden, and then guess who's next?
[00:28:40.781 --> 00:28:41.041]  Guess.
[00:28:41.241 --> 00:28:42.342]  You may have heard of the family.
[00:28:42.442 --> 00:28:43.162]  Do you want
[00:28:43.877 --> 00:28:44.377]  Guess what?
[00:28:44.417 --> 00:28:45.698]  He's sitting in the Oval Office.
[00:28:46.278 --> 00:28:47.558]  Yes.
[00:28:48.279 --> 00:28:49.159]  You're doubting me?
[00:28:49.199 --> 00:28:50.279]  Just go read it.
[00:28:50.740 --> 00:28:57.982]  Because people who are into the financial information and the financial trades, it's all there, but it'll never be on CNN.
[00:28:59.283 --> 00:29:05.405]  And so you tell somebody that, they just roll their eyes and, oh, it's all made up.
[00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:15.663]  We're going to come back and I promise we'll go to Paul in England, Renee in Texas, David in Mass, Mark in South Dakota, Jason in Maryland, and many others.
[00:29:15.703 --> 00:29:17.323]  But here's the type of news I have in front of me.
[00:29:17.703 --> 00:29:17.944]  U.S.
[00:29:18.024 --> 00:29:19.104]  outsourced torture.
[00:29:19.844 --> 00:29:25.086]  Officer docked pay for torturing Iraqi to death, not because he killed him, but because he didn't follow exact procedures.
[00:29:26.206 --> 00:29:31.748]  General Hayden says he's not worried about the Fourth Amendment and that it doesn't protect you from having the NSA spying on you.
[00:29:33.189 --> 00:29:36.090]  He said the Fourth Amendment does not say you need a warrant.
[00:29:36.310 --> 00:29:37.030]  He said that repeatedly.
[00:29:37.602 --> 00:29:38.062]  We're on the march.
[00:29:38.102 --> 00:29:39.904]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:39.924 --> 00:29:41.105]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.718 --> 00:30:03.880]  Ever wish your kid came with an instruction manual?
[00:30:04.160 --> 00:30:10.084]  I'm behavioral therapist James Lehman and I'll show you how to change your child's behavior now with the Total Transformation.
[00:30:10.264 --> 00:30:16.869]  The program that helps stop defiance, backtalking, lying, acting out in school, even problems with ADD and ADHD.
[00:30:17.110 --> 00:30:19.411]  There's no screaming, no fighting, no frustration.
[00:30:19.631 --> 00:30:20.452]  Your child will listen.
[00:30:20.652 --> 00:30:27.557]  When my son started having behavior problems, the total transformation techniques were like the instruction manual on how to deal with him.
[00:30:27.577 --> 00:30:28.678]  We got immediate results.
[00:30:40.806 --> 00:30:42.907]  Do you need an instruction manual for your kid?
[00:30:43.367 --> 00:30:51.649]  I'm behavioral therapist James Lehman and I'll show you how to change your child's behavior now with the Total Transformation, the program that helps stop defiance and backtalking.
[00:30:51.889 --> 00:30:54.150]  Your child will listen to you again, I guarantee it.
[00:30:54.390 --> 00:30:54.990]  Call now 1-800-373-0402 1-800-373-0402
[00:31:01.579 --> 00:31:07.801]  The illuminated Berkey base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[00:31:07.961 --> 00:31:14.124]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[00:31:14.404 --> 00:31:22.827]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[00:31:23.087 --> 00:31:30.090]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[00:31:30.410 --> 00:31:35.234]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[00:31:35.454 --> 00:31:40.858]  The Berkey Base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[00:31:41.198 --> 00:31:44.261]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[00:31:44.601 --> 00:31:52.567]  Get the illuminated Berkey Base for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:31:52.607 --> 00:31:53.188]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[00:32:01.434 --> 00:32:05.435]  Heart disease continues to be the leading cause of death in America today.
[00:32:05.876 --> 00:32:09.337]  In 25% of the cases, the first sign is sudden death.
[00:32:09.797 --> 00:32:13.019]  Cardivite has been helping people live as long as God intended us.
[00:32:13.419 --> 00:32:18.001]  Made from seven herbs, cardivite is the purest form of oral chelation available today.
[00:32:18.021 --> 00:32:19.982]  Here's what one person has to say.
[00:32:20.302 --> 00:32:24.005]  I was feeling chest pain from time to time, shortness of breath.
[00:32:24.145 --> 00:32:27.988]  I don't have the tightness on my chest, and I don't have that shortness of breath no more.
[00:32:28.208 --> 00:32:29.389]  I've tried all kinds of junk.
[00:32:29.589 --> 00:32:30.109]  It didn't do.
[00:32:30.210 --> 00:32:32.211]  The only thing that worked was your Cardivite.
[00:32:32.591 --> 00:32:34.913]  If you believe Cardivite was made for you, call 1-877-928-8822.
[00:32:34.973 --> 00:32:35.534]  That's 1-877-928-8822.
[00:32:35.554 --> 00:32:36.795]  Or visit our website at heartdrop.com.
[00:32:48.363 --> 00:32:52.665]  That's H-E-A-R-T-D-R-O-P dot com.
[00:32:53.065 --> 00:32:57.927]  Cartabyte is an all-natural supplement, so call today 1-877-928-8822.
[00:33:02.529 --> 00:33:09.132]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:18.849 --> 00:33:22.753]  Let me just briefly here, then I'm going to get more into it later.
[00:33:22.773 --> 00:33:27.077]  Get into the spying, and then we'll go right to your phone calls.
[00:33:28.398 --> 00:33:33.643]  There's this General Hayden, and he's the head of the National Security Agency.
[00:33:33.683 --> 00:33:38.227]  Now folks, ten years ago, the media was still not reporting on the NSA.
[00:33:39.709 --> 00:33:48.835]  There was no law that you didn't report on it, but I remember doing radio talk shows talking about the NSA and having people calling in and going, Alex, they don't listen to anything.
[00:33:48.875 --> 00:33:49.996]  They don't have the power to do that.
[00:33:50.036 --> 00:33:51.377]  And I'm like, it's declassified.
[00:33:51.397 --> 00:33:53.679]  The NSA is just listening to everything.
[00:33:53.919 --> 00:33:54.759]  That is randomly.
[00:33:54.799 --> 00:33:58.182]  It's not always listening to everything, but it is sampling everything.
[00:33:58.242 --> 00:33:58.802]  It's sampling.
[00:33:58.822 --> 00:34:02.525]  I mean, all of us have had the NSA computers dialing in on what we're doing.
[00:34:03.721 --> 00:34:09.765]  In the last few years, they've admitted it, oh, but it's for your safety, and now, oh, we're listening to you, because they want to have a chilling effect.
[00:34:10.005 --> 00:34:11.686]  Good, I'm glad the NSA's listening.
[00:34:12.126 --> 00:34:15.048]  We get emails and calls all the time from their employees who are outraged.
[00:34:15.088 --> 00:34:16.409]  They know who the real terrorists are.
[00:34:16.649 --> 00:34:26.915]  By the way, the NSA caught all the chatter of the 9-11 attacks, and then Bush tried to claim, remember, that he had no prior knowledge, and then all the NSA stuff went public, and they knew everything in total detail.
[00:34:27.435 --> 00:34:29.697]  Well, of course, it was actually picking up
[00:34:32.038 --> 00:34:34.339]  Another branch of the government's own operation.
[00:34:35.459 --> 00:34:36.699]  That's why we know about W1999.
[00:34:37.100 --> 00:34:38.940]  That's why we know about Able Danger.
[00:34:40.181 --> 00:34:45.323]  But continuing here, Defending Spy Program General Reveals Shaky Grip on Fourth Amendment.
[00:34:45.723 --> 00:34:51.085]  An editor and publisher, a newspaper magazine, put out a big report on this.
[00:34:52.875 --> 00:35:07.118]  This little press conference that he gave at the end of last week, and this individual, or actually the beginning of this week, the National Security Director of the National Security Agency, in an appearance before the National Press Club in Washington, D.C.
[00:35:07.178 --> 00:35:20.121]  today, appeared to be unfamiliar with the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution, when pressed by a reporter from Knight Ritter's Washington office, despite his claims that he was actually something of an expert on it.
[00:35:20.601 --> 00:35:24.403]  And, of course, that must have been one of the few reporters that isn't on the CIA payroll.
[00:35:24.423 --> 00:35:25.704]  Let me tell you something, folks.
[00:35:26.324 --> 00:35:36.249]  Most of the reporters, most of the reporters that are allowed in to those Capitol Hill briefings and those NSA and CIA briefings are government ops.
[00:35:36.269 --> 00:35:41.992]  This, of course, was National Press Club, where a quite large gathering gets in and occasionally somebody slips through.
[00:35:42.012 --> 00:35:44.593]  And, of course, most of them aren't on CIA payroll.
[00:35:44.613 --> 00:35:45.393]  You go, what do you mean?
[00:35:45.433 --> 00:35:47.274]  You just said most of them are on CIA payroll.
[00:35:47.294 --> 00:35:48.415]  Let me be specific.
[00:35:49.791 --> 00:35:51.852]  Most of them are on government payroll.
[00:35:52.772 --> 00:35:59.795]  Most of the anchors and top individuals you see on the news or TV are actually pulling lucrative paychecks from the government.
[00:36:00.115 --> 00:36:01.236]  Now that was declassified in 77.
[00:36:03.613 --> 00:36:21.231]  And now, of course, you've heard a lot more about it, but a lot of them are on CIA, a lot of them are on Defense Intelligence, a lot of them are on Pentagon, even more on agencies with bigger budgets, Department of Agriculture, Department of Labor, just on and on and on and on and on.
[00:36:21.311 --> 00:36:23.233]  BATF, FBI.
[00:36:24.483 --> 00:36:25.544]  Let me give you a hint.
[00:36:25.704 --> 00:36:33.910]  Most of the writers you read in the newspaper who quote are the resident journalist who, say for the local Austin paper, who does reports on the state police.
[00:36:34.551 --> 00:36:37.814]  Well, then you look at, oh, Billy Bob worked ten years ago.
[00:36:38.234 --> 00:36:40.436]  This is a real case, but I'm not going to mention the guy's name today.
[00:36:41.456 --> 00:36:42.697]  He worked for the DPS.
[00:36:42.737 --> 00:36:43.858]  He was their PR man.
[00:36:43.878 --> 00:36:44.999]  And oh, then you look closer.
[00:36:45.339 --> 00:36:46.660]  Oh, he's still getting a paycheck.
[00:36:47.021 --> 00:36:49.863]  It's like Tommy Franks running around all over the news.
[00:36:49.903 --> 00:36:53.486]  And I've got clips of him on places like Fox News going,
[00:36:54.146 --> 00:36:56.467]  Let me just say, I'm not a Republican or a Democrat.
[00:36:56.787 --> 00:36:59.068]  Remember before the election, it was that same spiel.
[00:36:59.148 --> 00:37:00.108]  I'm not for either party.
[00:37:01.188 --> 00:37:03.989]  But torture's good, and we may have to have martial law.
[00:37:04.649 --> 00:37:06.009]  We've got those clips in the computer.
[00:37:06.470 --> 00:37:09.911]  I'm sad about martial law, but it may happen, may be needed.
[00:37:10.431 --> 00:37:11.291]  People may want it.
[00:37:12.927 --> 00:37:19.270]  It turned out the guy is getting, what was it, $400,000 a year as a PR propaganda.
[00:37:19.570 --> 00:37:26.894]  It just... No, you're not a Republican or a Democrat, you're still a Pentagon officer being paid to go live.
[00:37:26.914 --> 00:37:29.415]  Now you see, this is the problem.
[00:37:29.435 --> 00:37:30.395]  I said I'm going to go to your calls.
[00:37:30.935 --> 00:37:33.377]  But this is how the data all interconnects.
[00:37:35.177 --> 00:37:38.219]  Defending the spy program, the NSA General,
[00:37:39.332 --> 00:37:52.240]  gets up there and says, and this is how their spin works, they say, oh, the second amendment says it's well regulated, it means the National Guard, but you read on, it says, no, the individual shall not be barred the ownership of guns, firearms.
[00:37:52.561 --> 00:37:57.304]  You read all the Federalist Papers, it was the only thing the founding fathers, that and the first amendment, agreed on.
[00:37:58.544 --> 00:38:06.970]  I mean, it was one of the only unanimous bill of particulars added on there, at the end of the Constitution being formed.
[00:38:09.153 --> 00:38:13.376]  That Patrick Henry and a few others forced the passage of to ensure individual freedoms.
[00:38:13.416 --> 00:38:16.177]  By the way, he doesn't give you your rights.
[00:38:16.217 --> 00:38:21.761]  It simply points out God-given, unalienable rights that exist organically.
[00:38:23.242 --> 00:38:23.682]  Example?
[00:38:23.842 --> 00:38:25.003]  I use it because it's the best.
[00:38:25.443 --> 00:38:26.203]  I use it every day.
[00:38:26.964 --> 00:38:28.345]  Or maybe once a week, to be accurate.
[00:38:29.225 --> 00:38:30.446]  I already used it once today, though.
[00:38:32.330 --> 00:38:39.993]  If I became dictator tomorrow because I could convince the army to follow me, and that's what tyranny is, and I could propagandize the public, and then I announced my next edict.
[00:38:41.013 --> 00:38:50.056]  Blacks need to report for their own safety, to their own communal living areas, and you're going to need to pay your way in these areas, so you're not going to have any rights.
[00:38:51.735 --> 00:38:54.317]  Of course, nowadays they'd spin it and call it, you're getting more rights.
[00:38:54.357 --> 00:39:00.922]  You have the right to live with a ball and chain around your ankle and with men aiming machine guns at you and you're going to pull plows all day.
[00:39:01.843 --> 00:39:02.844]  Now they're more sophisticated.
[00:39:02.864 --> 00:39:04.625]  They wouldn't call it slavery, they'd call it freedom.
[00:39:05.826 --> 00:39:15.433]  Does the black man have the right to grab the machine gun away from the person in the black ski mask there at the slave camp and to get out of the camp and try to escape with his family?
[00:39:15.754 --> 00:39:18.856]  The government would say no, the president has the power to do whatever he wants.
[00:39:19.460 --> 00:39:22.181]  Well, common sense and God's law says that he can't.
[00:39:24.521 --> 00:39:27.122]  And believe me, folks, that's what the White House is asserting.
[00:39:27.182 --> 00:39:31.784]  They are saying, you see, to really have martial law, they have to announce it.
[00:39:33.064 --> 00:39:37.125]  They have to say, hey, we've built emergency centers to relocate you.
[00:39:37.145 --> 00:39:38.546]  They've done it in England and in the U.S.
[00:39:38.586 --> 00:39:39.486]  and all over Western Europe.
[00:39:39.706 --> 00:39:40.786]  It's a global move.
[00:39:41.366 --> 00:39:45.007]  Hey, I've got the power to torture and kill and break any law I want.
[00:39:45.127 --> 00:39:45.908]  I'm your president.
[00:39:46.288 --> 00:39:46.808]  Okay?
[00:39:47.691 --> 00:39:50.032]  Every time he signs a bill, I don't have to follow this.
[00:39:50.292 --> 00:39:51.412]  I am the source of law.
[00:39:52.173 --> 00:39:53.113]  Like he's God.
[00:39:54.693 --> 00:40:00.595]  And again, I don't care if it's Bill Clinton or George Bush, or if Al Gore would have gotten elected, I will fight it all just as vehemently.
[00:40:01.096 --> 00:40:07.658]  But so many Republicans go, well, I don't care if it's George Bush and it's the fight of NARAB, then I'm for it.
[00:40:08.498 --> 00:40:10.599]  But let's just read the fourth amendment before I play this clip.
[00:40:11.861 --> 00:40:21.389]  Because he gets up, just like with the Second Amendment, and tries to spin it that, oh no, it's well regulated, or, well, it protects you from unreasonable searches.
[00:40:21.709 --> 00:40:26.013]  Well, it's reasonable when we pull you over at a machine gun checkpoint and search your car.
[00:40:26.553 --> 00:40:32.878]  By the way, those are popping up more and more often with the military, with the police, and federal troops around the country.
[00:40:32.898 --> 00:40:34.519]  I mean, even in places like Dallas, folks.
[00:40:34.940 --> 00:40:38.963]  Houston's having a big drill right now, and oops, the drill goes live.
[00:40:39.203 --> 00:40:40.264]  They start searching everyone.
[00:40:41.711 --> 00:40:43.212]  And again, that happened before 9-11.
[00:40:43.252 --> 00:40:47.075]  We got Marines in Swansboro, North Carolina out searching real people.
[00:40:47.115 --> 00:40:48.335]  Pulling people out of cars.
[00:40:48.656 --> 00:40:50.337]  It's to see what they can get away with.
[00:40:52.138 --> 00:40:54.940]  So he gets up there and he says, it's against unreasonable.
[00:40:55.020 --> 00:40:57.021]  And they go, but doesn't that mean with probable cause?
[00:40:57.561 --> 00:40:58.762]  With a warrant.
[00:40:58.782 --> 00:41:00.743]  Tries to say warrant, but he moves on past that.
[00:41:01.524 --> 00:41:04.766]  Hoping, knowing that 99% of Americans are not going to go read this.
[00:41:04.786 --> 00:41:05.507]  Well, let me just read it.
[00:41:06.207 --> 00:41:10.670]  The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects.
[00:41:11.832 --> 00:41:14.514]  That means the bank, without a warrant, giving the IRS all your data.
[00:41:14.534 --> 00:41:16.355]  The IRS is tied right into all banks, folks.
[00:41:17.296 --> 00:41:25.642]  I mean, Bush signed an executive order last year that every prescription you get, when you get it, the minute you get it, is instantly uploaded to the federal government.
[00:41:25.983 --> 00:41:28.565]  I mean, forget warrants, it's all being directly wired in.
[00:41:28.585 --> 00:41:30.846]  Let me try to read it again.
[00:41:31.787 --> 00:41:39.393]  The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures shall not be violated.
[00:41:40.476 --> 00:41:48.801]  And no warrants shall be issued, not that you don't even get a warrant, without, but no warrant shall be issued, but upon probable cause.
[00:41:50.131 --> 00:41:51.012]  And what is probable cause?
[00:41:51.052 --> 00:41:51.492]  It tells you.
[00:41:51.912 --> 00:42:00.278]  Supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched and the persons and things to be seized.
[00:42:00.699 --> 00:42:14.809]  You've got to have a witness, and in the case law show before our modern, the slave age, the neo-slave age, that that was multiple witnesses specifically saying, I saw the dead body in the basement.
[00:42:15.689 --> 00:42:20.695]  Specifically saying, you know, I saw the stolen painting hanging on his wall.
[00:42:21.937 --> 00:42:27.363]  Specifically, and they're on record, see, because later in the Bill of Rights, you have a right to face your accusers.
[00:42:27.624 --> 00:42:30.107]  Well, confidential informants, you don't get to face them.
[00:42:31.234 --> 00:42:34.637]  Or confidential detective, or undercover officer.
[00:42:34.698 --> 00:42:41.263]  You don't ever get to... See, it's all being... See, you talk about one part, and then 50 other sections.
[00:42:41.584 --> 00:42:43.765]  And you go, there's only 10, how is it 50 others?
[00:42:43.785 --> 00:42:52.253]  Well, there's multiple clauses and laws and statements of law within every amendment.
[00:42:53.214 --> 00:42:54.635]  So let me just read it all without interrupting.
[00:42:55.698 --> 00:43:11.578]  The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures shall not be violated and no warrant shall be issued but upon probable cause supported by oath or affirmation and particularly describing the place to be searched and the persons or things to be seized.
[00:43:12.589 --> 00:43:16.752]  So the cops started having trained dogs that of course they're going to bark because they want a biscuit.
[00:43:16.992 --> 00:43:17.893]  They always alert.
[00:43:17.933 --> 00:43:18.894]  That's the inside joke.
[00:43:19.254 --> 00:43:21.275]  So now the dog says, I get to search your car.
[00:43:21.535 --> 00:43:23.097]  Well, now they're even dispensing with the dogs.
[00:43:23.137 --> 00:43:24.137]  No, you can't search my car.
[00:43:24.157 --> 00:43:25.678]  90% of the time.
[00:43:26.079 --> 00:43:26.519]  All right.
[00:43:26.599 --> 00:43:28.601]  I'm calling back up and get up against the car.
[00:43:28.621 --> 00:43:29.821]  Going to put you in handcuffs.
[00:43:29.961 --> 00:43:30.842]  I feel threatened.
[00:43:30.922 --> 00:43:31.743]  I'm on search.
[00:43:32.403 --> 00:43:36.266]  To see if the poor person is using drugs that your boss has shipped in.
[00:43:38.087 --> 00:43:39.228]  You got to love it, folks.
[00:43:39.648 --> 00:43:40.369]  You got to love it.
[00:43:41.907 --> 00:43:48.429]  Meanwhile at the public school, a thousand yards away, the teacher is pushing Ritalin on a child with the almost exact same molecule.
[00:43:49.449 --> 00:43:50.590]  By that I mean it's the same drug.
[00:43:52.710 --> 00:43:53.971]  And it just goes on and on here.
[00:43:54.011 --> 00:43:57.552]  So I thought I would read what the Fourth Amendment says before we play this guy.
[00:43:58.392 --> 00:43:59.413]  Now listen to his spin.
[00:43:59.453 --> 00:44:02.173]  He says over and over again, there's nothing about probable cause.
[00:44:02.213 --> 00:44:06.795]  But see, the cops and the government and the judges and the whole system, most cops believe this.
[00:44:07.015 --> 00:44:10.076]  They've been told that probable cause is just because you got a hunch.
[00:44:10.774 --> 00:44:12.495]  Just because you smell a rat.
[00:44:12.976 --> 00:44:15.178]  Just because you think something's going on.
[00:44:16.439 --> 00:44:16.899]  Okay.
[00:44:18.300 --> 00:44:19.901]  No, that's not probable cause.
[00:44:20.122 --> 00:44:26.187]  Now, if the person's sweating, acting suspicious, and there's a reek coming from the trunk, yeah, that's probable cause.
[00:44:26.227 --> 00:44:27.347]  And you open it up and there's a dead body.
[00:44:28.709 --> 00:44:33.552]  Or the car matches a description or is speeding away from where you just got a call that was a burglary.
[00:44:33.893 --> 00:44:34.473]  Absolutely.
[00:44:34.513 --> 00:44:35.394]  Pull the cars over.
[00:44:36.135 --> 00:44:40.178]  But it isn't, let's just go set up on the highway and start randomly
[00:44:40.868 --> 00:44:45.111]  The DPS in Texas says we can just pull over every third car because it's our policy.
[00:44:45.151 --> 00:44:48.273]  Because it's totally random, it's okay.
[00:44:48.333 --> 00:44:49.914]  No, that makes it even worse!
[00:44:50.715 --> 00:44:53.436]  I don't care what your policy paper says.
[00:44:53.777 --> 00:44:55.118]  I've read the Constitution.
[00:44:55.438 --> 00:44:56.539]  I've read the Bill of Rights.
[00:44:56.579 --> 00:44:59.460]  What you've sworn to, but what you violate every day.
[00:44:59.480 --> 00:45:00.421]  Alright, that's enough.
[00:45:00.601 --> 00:45:02.522]  Let's play this clip and then we'll go to some calls.
[00:45:02.583 --> 00:45:04.564]  Here is the NSA General
[00:45:05.407 --> 00:45:10.831]  At the National Press Club, and NBC's Elberman did do a good piece on this.
[00:45:10.851 --> 00:45:15.635]  You've got to admit, of all of them on there, he's one of the better ones, at least let some truth get through.
[00:45:16.315 --> 00:45:22.159]  And then he catches the guy, and believe me, the NSA director recently retired.
[00:45:22.499 --> 00:45:23.981]  Believe me, folks, he isn't stupid.
[00:45:24.021 --> 00:45:25.382]  He knows what the Fourth Amendment is.
[00:45:25.662 --> 00:45:27.323]  But this shows the crazy logic.
[00:45:27.363 --> 00:45:28.564]  It's like Alberto Gonzales.
[00:45:28.984 --> 00:45:32.787]  Well, it isn't torture if we didn't mean to torture you to death.
[00:45:34.159 --> 00:45:39.746]  Breaking bones, organ failure, everything is okay as long as we didn't mean to kill you.
[00:45:39.766 --> 00:45:42.489]  And then if we kill you and it was an accidental, that's not even torture.
[00:45:42.930 --> 00:45:43.691]  It's not even murder.
[00:45:45.064 --> 00:45:55.328]  And you know, you tortured the Iraqi General to death, or you tortured that child who does it in front of their parents, we're going to dock your pay and then promote you a month later.
[00:45:55.468 --> 00:46:02.331]  It's like the recruiter who called up threatening to arrest a kid if he didn't come into a recruiting meeting and sign the papers.
[00:46:02.971 --> 00:46:06.493]  Totally criminal, racketeering, fraud, extortion, intimidation.
[00:46:06.993 --> 00:46:09.214]  He got promoted and got a huge cash bonus.
[00:46:10.672 --> 00:46:13.673]  See, it's corruption, folks.
[00:46:14.153 --> 00:46:16.954]  Go ahead and roll the lying NSA General.
[00:46:17.934 --> 00:46:34.098]  My understanding is that the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution specifies that you must have probable cause to be able to do a search that does not violate an American's right against unlawful searches and seizures.
[00:46:34.218 --> 00:46:35.178]  This is the reporter.
[00:46:35.218 --> 00:46:36.859]  The Fourth Amendment actually
[00:46:37.479 --> 00:46:40.861]  It protects all of us against unreasonable search and seizure.
[00:46:41.021 --> 00:46:44.723]  But the measure is probable cause, I believe.
[00:46:44.743 --> 00:46:47.084]  The amendment says unreasonable search and seizure.
[00:46:47.384 --> 00:46:49.065]  But does it not say probable... No.
[00:46:49.645 --> 00:46:52.067]  The amendment says unreasonable search and seizure.
[00:46:52.087 --> 00:46:53.907]  The legal standard is probable cause.
[00:46:54.248 --> 00:47:02.052]  Just to be very clear, okay, and believe me, if there's any amendment to the Constitution that employees of the National Security Agency are familiar with, it's the fourth.
[00:47:02.712 --> 00:47:03.492]  Right?
[00:47:03.672 --> 00:47:06.694]  And it is a reasonable standard in the fourth amendment.
[00:47:08.038 --> 00:47:37.140]  To quote the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States in its entirety, the one the General and the NSA folks are so familiar with and know is about reasonableness and not about probable cause, quote, the right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures shall not be violated, no warrant shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched and the persons or things
[00:47:37.700 --> 00:47:38.500]  To be seized.
[00:47:39.821 --> 00:47:42.441]  Well, maybe they have a different constitution over there at the NSA.
[00:47:44.142 --> 00:47:47.223]  So, yeah, maybe they have a different constitution.
[00:47:47.263 --> 00:47:49.403]  No, that's what the gun control people do.
[00:47:50.184 --> 00:47:57.846]  They go, well, the first part of the Second Amendment talks about a well-regulated militia, so that means the National Guard.
[00:47:59.577 --> 00:48:06.882]  It says, a well-regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.
[00:48:07.242 --> 00:48:11.005]  They state the name, the militia, then they tell you what it is.
[00:48:11.065 --> 00:48:13.427]  The right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.
[00:48:13.727 --> 00:48:15.028]  It's just like here in the Fourth Amendment.
[00:48:16.245 --> 00:48:20.507]  It says you're not allowed to engage in unreasonable search and seizure.
[00:48:20.947 --> 00:48:22.488]  Then it says what that is.
[00:48:22.608 --> 00:48:28.510]  It says if you don't have a warrant with a sworn person, on record, specifically saying where to go look at.
[00:48:28.550 --> 00:48:30.751]  It's in the big brown box in the back bedroom.
[00:48:31.271 --> 00:48:33.532]  That's where the stolen jewelry is.
[00:48:34.032 --> 00:48:35.673]  I saw it or he told me it was there.
[00:48:36.273 --> 00:48:38.814]  And you swear an oath, you're going to get in trouble if you're lying.
[00:48:39.974 --> 00:48:40.354]  Okay?
[00:48:40.875 --> 00:48:42.375]  You understand this?
[00:48:42.575 --> 00:48:44.296]  You see, it tells you what it is.
[00:48:45.462 --> 00:48:47.004]  It says this is unreasonable.
[00:48:47.044 --> 00:48:48.245]  There's not going to be anything unreasonable.
[00:48:48.426 --> 00:48:51.229]  Then it says, to be reasonable, it's got to have all this.
[00:48:51.449 --> 00:48:52.350]  But not him.
[00:48:52.711 --> 00:48:54.713]  Not the NSA head.
[00:48:54.933 --> 00:48:59.979]  He'll just read the first line of it like a lawyer, like Bill Clinton saying the word is, is, is.
[00:49:00.260 --> 00:49:03.864]  And then we're all supposed to sit here like a bunch of idiots and buy that, folks.
[00:49:04.404 --> 00:49:06.585]  And believe me, the head of the NSA is not stupid.
[00:49:06.805 --> 00:49:08.125]  He knew exactly what he was doing.
[00:49:08.145 --> 00:49:08.625]  We're going to break.
[00:49:08.825 --> 00:49:16.967]  We'll go right to Paul, and David, and Mark, and Jason, and Ernie, and everybody else, and Bert as well, when we get back.
[00:49:17.007 --> 00:49:17.867]  So stay with us.
[00:49:19.148 --> 00:49:22.549]  I just had to spend some time on that, and I've got a bunch of other articles about it today.
[00:49:22.929 --> 00:49:27.530]  Scott McClellan, press secretary, whose daddy's been on this show and said that LBJ told him he killed Kennedy.
[00:49:27.870 --> 00:49:28.330]  Side issue.
[00:49:29.858 --> 00:49:32.259]  Scott McClellan says the spying is what it is.
[00:49:32.320 --> 00:49:32.980]  Get used to it.
[00:49:33.320 --> 00:49:34.501]  I mean, so that's the new arrogance.
[00:49:34.681 --> 00:49:35.041]  Hey!
[00:49:35.481 --> 00:49:35.761]  Hey!
[00:49:36.121 --> 00:49:37.382]  We're militarizing the police.
[00:49:37.402 --> 00:49:38.462]  We're building FEMA camps.
[00:49:38.843 --> 00:49:39.483]  You're our slave.
[00:49:39.523 --> 00:49:40.723]  Shut up.
[00:49:40.783 --> 00:49:45.046]  Newsweek, the other big brother, the Pentagon, has its own domestic spying program.
[00:49:45.106 --> 00:49:48.587]  Even its lead outfit may have gone too far.
[00:49:50.548 --> 00:49:52.249]  Even its leaders say it may have gone too far.
[00:49:53.613 --> 00:49:56.214]  And then here's another one, saying goodbye to privacy.
[00:49:56.234 --> 00:49:58.155]  It's just so, you know, the flaunting of it.
[00:49:58.195 --> 00:50:00.316]  Here's another one, Washington Examiner.
[00:50:00.336 --> 00:50:01.536]  24 hours of torture loving.
[00:50:01.596 --> 00:50:02.757]  The new show, 24.
[00:50:03.337 --> 00:50:05.978]  Here's another one, New York City plans ring of steel.
[00:50:06.038 --> 00:50:07.118]  Total martial law.
[00:50:07.419 --> 00:50:07.999]  Permanently.
[00:50:08.279 --> 00:50:09.599]  Just no freedom, no nothing.
[00:50:10.400 --> 00:50:11.520]  That's Newsmax.
[00:50:11.940 --> 00:50:13.061]  Here's Insight Magazine.
[00:50:13.101 --> 00:50:13.941]  Impeachment hearings.
[00:50:13.981 --> 00:50:16.862]  The White House presses for the worst.
[00:50:17.383 --> 00:50:18.163]  Suddenly can't read.
[00:50:18.203 --> 00:50:20.784]  The White House prepares for the worst.
[00:50:21.716 --> 00:50:25.379]  Patriot Act renewal includes creation of a federal police force.
[00:50:25.699 --> 00:50:28.762]  I'm glad somebody finally read what we talked about in there.
[00:50:29.222 --> 00:50:31.044]  Yes, a national police force.
[00:50:31.184 --> 00:50:31.885]  It's already there.
[00:50:33.146 --> 00:50:37.709]  They'll implement something and then get a law passed later to supposedly legalize it.
[00:50:37.970 --> 00:50:38.530]  It's amazing.
[00:50:38.890 --> 00:50:42.994]  It's like they already implemented Patriot Act II years before it was even attempted to be passed.
[00:50:43.434 --> 00:50:45.276]  City Demands Warrant from the FBI.
[00:50:45.436 --> 00:50:46.136]  That's a new one.
[00:50:46.156 --> 00:50:46.817]  That's something good.
[00:50:47.197 --> 00:50:52.122]  Israel tried to kill Bin Laden in 1996, but MI6 and the CIA protected him.
[00:50:52.702 --> 00:50:53.463]  That's in Reuters.
[00:50:54.042 --> 00:50:56.244]  I mean, this is the kind of news we got here for ya.
[00:50:56.784 --> 00:50:59.866]  Stay with us, we'll talk about the Hamas win in Israel, what that really means.
[00:51:01.667 --> 00:51:03.188]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:51:03.369 --> 00:51:06.471]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[00:51:06.591 --> 00:51:10.514]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[00:51:10.554 --> 00:51:14.777]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[00:51:15.137 --> 00:51:18.900]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[00:51:19.040 --> 00:51:20.841]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[00:51:21.021 --> 00:51:24.303]  Why have police attacked people on the street indiscriminately?
[00:51:24.363 --> 00:51:29.066]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[00:51:29.246 --> 00:51:32.287]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[00:51:32.467 --> 00:51:35.329]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[00:51:35.809 --> 00:51:41.933]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[00:51:42.453 --> 00:51:46.256]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.
[00:51:46.656 --> 00:51:48.017]  Order your video today.
[00:51:48.437 --> 00:51:49.418]  Call toll free at 888-253-3139.
[00:51:49.478 --> 00:51:51.719]  The number to order to take over again is 888-253-3139.
[00:51:51.779 --> 00:51:53.220]  Or go to my website, InfoWars.com.
[00:52:01.025 --> 00:52:08.532]  Get the new Berkey Battery Adapter, an inexpensive yet long-term backup power supply for your Berkey Light LED system.
[00:52:08.813 --> 00:52:19.743]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because incredibly they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark.
[00:52:19.983 --> 00:52:21.805]  Yet require very little energy.
[00:52:22.066 --> 00:52:25.390]  That's why this revolutionary new technology is a bit expensive.
[00:52:25.730 --> 00:52:27.072]  But it's worth every penny.
[00:52:27.192 --> 00:52:36.183]  Because the low energy LEDs are able to provide light all night long for over two weeks on a single set of four AA alkaline batteries.
[00:52:36.463 --> 00:52:36.963]  That's right!
[00:52:37.143 --> 00:52:44.267]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[00:52:44.547 --> 00:52:48.689]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey Battery Adapter.

[00:53:08.995 --> 00:53:11.256]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.
[00:53:11.456 --> 00:53:17.798]  We provide outstanding products like ECAC, colloidal silver 500 parts per million, olive leaf extract,
[00:53:18.178 --> 00:53:18.578]  I think so.
[00:53:38.473 --> 00:53:38.853]  I think so.
[00:54:01.548 --> 00:54:07.135]  By the way, I want to apologize to Ernie.
[00:54:07.255 --> 00:54:07.896]  I mean it.
[00:54:16.861 --> 00:54:18.002]  I like Bert and Ernie.
[00:54:18.042 --> 00:54:23.864]  My children, I occasionally let them watch TV for an hour, maybe every couple of weeks, and I let them watch Sesame Street.
[00:54:24.164 --> 00:54:24.865]  They like Bert and Ernie.
[00:54:24.885 --> 00:54:26.165]  I was not making fun of the name Ernie.
[00:54:26.185 --> 00:54:27.426]  I think I have a good friend named Ernie.
[00:54:27.766 --> 00:54:32.288]  Soon as I made that joke about Ernie's coming up and so is Bert, Ernie hung up.
[00:54:32.328 --> 00:54:34.089]  So call back Ernie if you can get back in.
[00:54:34.749 --> 00:54:36.410]  Paul in England, thanks for holding.
[00:54:36.450 --> 00:54:37.210]  You're on the air.
[00:54:37.270 --> 00:54:37.630]  Welcome.
[00:54:38.811 --> 00:54:39.411]  It's a pleasure.
[00:54:39.491 --> 00:54:40.451]  Finally to talk to you, Alex.
[00:54:40.812 --> 00:54:41.412]  Nice to talk to you.
[00:54:43.143 --> 00:54:47.967]  Sorry, is President Ahmadinejad, is he a neocon asset?
[00:54:48.027 --> 00:54:50.429]  Is he part of the plan to hit Iran?
[00:54:52.256 --> 00:55:05.026]  You know, I don't know if he is, but I know that the Ayatollah Khomeini was, and I know that he springs from that revolution, and I believe he may have been one of the hostage-takers.
[00:55:05.626 --> 00:55:15.214]  He has kind of been mum on the subject and then was forced to deny it, but I know that event was staged, and I know he was involved in politics at that time.
[00:55:16.274 --> 00:55:20.718]  I don't know, but I know that he seems to be playing right into their hands with the statements
[00:55:22.940 --> 00:55:25.583]  I mean, Saddam was their former boy, that's admitted.
[00:55:25.903 --> 00:55:28.245]  Bin Laden is, and always was.
[00:55:29.146 --> 00:55:38.636]  We know that Hamas, again, this is hidden in plain view, was founded and funded by Israeli intelligence services.
[00:55:38.696 --> 00:55:42.360]  We know that it just came out multiple times in the last few years that
[00:55:43.155 --> 00:55:52.340]  Some of the so-called Al-Qaeda cells they've busted in Israel are really Palestinians hired in a ten-year program by the Israelis to carry out bombings.
[00:55:53.500 --> 00:56:02.125]  So you have to look at who really gains from all of this, and now you have Hamas being elected there in the Palestinian government.
[00:56:02.485 --> 00:56:06.207]  The whole thing, again, do the globalists sell more weapons and get more control?
[00:56:06.507 --> 00:56:11.810]  And does the Israeli government get to even dominate their own population and not allow press freedom to a great extent?
[00:56:13.051 --> 00:56:25.399]  If they have a friendly Palestinian government that's mainstream, and who can garner support from the public, and who is kind of taking a Gandhi-type, Gandhi-esque approach?
[00:56:25.880 --> 00:56:26.160]  No!
[00:56:26.260 --> 00:56:34.666]  But if they're running around suicide bombing, some of it real, and some other cases provocateur, then it does help the New World Order.
[00:56:36.127 --> 00:56:37.028]  Right.
[00:56:37.068 --> 00:56:38.529]  I've got another question for you.
[00:56:38.549 --> 00:56:39.990]  It hasn't come up before, which surprised me.
[00:56:41.044 --> 00:56:45.330]  When is Jeb Bush being groomed to take on the presidential ticket?
[00:56:45.830 --> 00:56:52.779]  Well, he had first said with our royal bloodline here in America, now the Bushies, he had first sworn that he would never run.
[00:56:52.859 --> 00:56:57.245]  Now he's talking about it and has formed a little exploratory committee.
[00:56:58.328 --> 00:57:02.050]  Just a few months ago I saw that on some of the Florida papers.
[00:57:02.971 --> 00:57:16.179]  I don't know if that will happen, but certainly Jeb and Neil and others are much more intelligent and well-spoken, and all of course accomplish major fraud than their oldest brother.
[00:57:16.219 --> 00:57:17.500]  But you know how royalty works.
[00:57:17.540 --> 00:57:19.441]  It's like Kim Jong Il in North Korea.
[00:57:20.061 --> 00:57:21.302]  The other son doesn't get it.
[00:57:21.322 --> 00:57:22.943]  It has to be the firstborn.
[00:57:24.584 --> 00:57:24.784]  Right.
[00:57:25.545 --> 00:57:25.805]  Okay.
[00:57:28.204 --> 00:57:29.225]  Anything else?
[00:57:29.926 --> 00:57:34.609]  Well, I'm sure there are other things to ask you, but I'm going to let someone else have a go.
[00:57:34.629 --> 00:57:38.012]  It's been an absolute pleasure, and we're keeping the light shining for you here.
[00:57:38.492 --> 00:57:40.654]  Well, Paul, I'm honored to have you as a listener over in the UK.
[00:57:40.674 --> 00:57:42.055]  How did you hear about the broadcast?
[00:57:43.036 --> 00:57:44.697]  One last thing I was going to say.
[00:57:45.118 --> 00:57:52.424]  There's a verse in the book of Revelations, and it says, a seven-headed serpent will rise from the east, but the final victim will be born in the west.
[00:57:52.504 --> 00:57:55.406]  When I first read that, I used to think, well, it's bound to be an American president.
[00:57:56.129 --> 00:57:58.311]  I'm increasingly thinking it's got to be Alex Jones.
[00:57:59.552 --> 00:58:00.092]  Okay.
[00:58:00.433 --> 00:58:01.213]  Thank you for the call.
[00:58:01.233 --> 00:58:01.974]  I appreciate it.
[00:58:02.815 --> 00:58:16.967]  Folks, if I'm the best we've got, we're in a lot of trouble, and I am just an average little nobody who likes to sit around a little wooden pier and fish.
[00:58:17.691 --> 00:58:25.199]  So, please, folks, the answer is you becoming leaders, getting involved, fighting the New World Order, informing others.
[00:58:25.279 --> 00:58:33.207]  It is not through leaders being anointed to carry out some type of holy war.
[00:58:33.227 --> 00:58:39.473]  All right, we'll be right back with a bunch of your phone calls and a ton of other news items we haven't even mentioned.
[00:58:41.579 --> 00:58:46.244]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[00:58:57.988 --> 00:58:58.628]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.309 --> 00:59:00.370]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:01.070 --> 00:59:02.211]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.231 --> 00:59:03.652]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.393 --> 00:59:05.914]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.974 --> 00:59:09.776]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.157 --> 00:59:14.280]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:17.302 --> 00:59:20.244]  It is Friday, the 27th day.
[00:59:23.917 --> 00:59:24.698]  of January 2006.
[00:59:25.980 --> 00:59:27.503]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[00:59:27.963 --> 00:59:30.126]  We've got two more hours spanning out before us.
[00:59:30.186 --> 00:59:39.200]  Imagine going out to protest Halliburton for ripping off the soldiers and contractors that ate their diseased and, you know,
[00:59:40.001 --> 00:59:40.722]  Poisonous food.
[00:59:40.782 --> 00:59:42.743]  It gave people food poisoning over and over again.
[00:59:42.763 --> 00:59:44.524]  They overcharged many times for it.
[00:59:44.845 --> 00:59:47.306]  I mean, they pled guilty a bunch and paid huge fines.
[00:59:47.707 --> 00:59:52.930]  Well, this group goes out and protests, and the Army's stalking them and spying on them and doing all of this.
[00:59:52.970 --> 00:59:57.113]  So, we'll be talking to them coming up later in the third hour.
[00:59:57.133 --> 00:59:59.795]  In the meantime, I do want to start getting into more of your calls.
[00:59:59.915 --> 01:00:02.337]  We'll also get into some interesting little stories like this one.
[01:00:03.742 --> 01:00:05.444]  Mexican migrants to get U.S.
[01:00:05.564 --> 01:00:07.165]  maps from the Mexican government.
[01:00:07.666 --> 01:00:10.288]  I just want to point out some of the hypocrisy of the Mexican government.
[01:00:10.608 --> 01:00:14.231]  And then also show how this shows how the war on terror is a complete fraud.
[01:00:14.872 --> 01:00:17.274]  And I want to get more into the domestic spying program.
[01:00:17.354 --> 01:00:19.816]  Just new revelations coming out on that on a daily basis.
[01:00:20.156 --> 01:00:24.260]  More coming out on the Patriot Act that they just reauthorized and, yes, actually expanded.
[01:00:25.803 --> 01:00:35.946]  And I want to also get into some reports about Hamas and its win of the parliament there in the Palestinian election.
[01:00:36.346 --> 01:00:45.950]  Plus Cheney and Netanyahu pushing for war against Syria with Lieberman, Senator Lieberman running around saying how wonderful it is with a bunch of other hawk Democrats.
[01:00:46.430 --> 01:00:50.631]  So that is coming up as well this hour.
[01:00:50.991 --> 01:00:53.372]  Right now, let's talk to David and Mass, then Mark.
[01:00:53.992 --> 01:00:55.433]  Jason, Cliff, Steve, and others.
[01:00:55.573 --> 01:00:56.153]  Go ahead, David.
[01:00:56.913 --> 01:00:57.854]  Alex, how are you today?
[01:00:58.034 --> 01:00:58.374]  Good, sir.
[01:00:59.455 --> 01:01:02.296]  I got an article today from MSNBC.
[01:01:02.356 --> 01:01:04.417]  This is pretty unbelievable, I thought.
[01:01:05.657 --> 01:01:08.759]  California declares second-hand smoke a pollutant.
[01:01:09.159 --> 01:01:12.521]  Now, listen to where this is... They're going to ban it in your house.
[01:01:14.201 --> 01:01:16.362]  It's already happened in areas of Florida and California.
[01:01:16.603 --> 01:01:17.063]  Exactly.
[01:01:17.103 --> 01:01:19.964]  They go from, okay, as you know, from restaurants and bars.
[01:01:20.024 --> 01:01:21.825]  Now, I personally am not a smoker.
[01:01:22.571 --> 01:01:27.113]  You know, and I understand being in a restaurant environment... I'm not either!
[01:01:27.673 --> 01:01:33.175]  Yeah, and other people, of course, I understand it in that sense, to have a barrier or a second room.
[01:01:33.755 --> 01:01:37.256]  But now, you know, they move it outside to say, okay, you can smoke out.
[01:01:37.316 --> 01:01:40.697]  Now it's going to look like, well, we're going to arrest you if you smoke outside.
[01:01:40.877 --> 01:01:42.318]  Let me just read a couple little things here.
[01:01:42.338 --> 01:01:50.701]  It says right here, the California became the first state to declare secondhand smoke a toxic air pollutant Thursday.
[01:01:51.326 --> 01:01:59.851]  Citing its link to breast cancer, experts said the decision may have more impact worldwide than it does in a largely smoke-free area.
[01:02:00.071 --> 01:02:06.795]  And of course a weed, and that's really what tobacco is, well I guess a weed is any plant you don't want, but I mean it resembles a low bush.
[01:02:07.536 --> 01:02:13.719]  A weed burning in small levels of people all over the city, smoking cigarettes, that doesn't hurt anybody.
[01:02:14.300 --> 01:02:15.480]  Right, well listen to the cleverly PR
[01:02:18.826 --> 01:02:26.451]  The term that they've created, ETS, environmental smoke, tobacco smoke, they're calling it ETS.
[01:02:26.491 --> 01:02:28.052]  First one on me, I've heard of that.
[01:02:28.472 --> 01:02:29.993]  The effects of passive smoke.
[01:02:30.033 --> 01:02:34.616]  It said their report assessment draws on more than a thousand other studies.
[01:02:34.656 --> 01:02:36.377]  They do that because it sounds real official.
[01:02:36.397 --> 01:02:38.338]  People go, oh, ZLQ-9R, oh, ZLQ-9R.
[01:02:38.378 --> 01:02:40.980]  Yes, it blames secondhand smoke on 4,000 deaths.
[01:02:46.062 --> 01:02:55.466]  Los Angeles and the surrounding area is a toxic pea soup of industrial and automobile waste.
[01:02:55.646 --> 01:02:57.346]  And that's because of the geography.
[01:02:57.386 --> 01:03:00.288]  The mountains block in that moist...
[01:03:01.889 --> 01:03:05.371]  Pacific Air, and so it all just sits there and isn't blown and dispersed.
[01:03:05.431 --> 01:03:13.656]  Right, and the more people, I mean, more than 4,000 people I think have died from that, and they want to try to make it look like all of California is 35 million people.
[01:03:13.716 --> 01:03:14.716]  Well, David, here's the deal.
[01:03:14.816 --> 01:03:16.918]  They're actually banning it in houses now.
[01:03:17.458 --> 01:03:28.044]  There's cases where city workers, in one case we interviewed him, a cop who's a captain, on the force 20-something years, is seen smoking a cigar at a party, he's fired.
[01:03:28.784 --> 01:03:37.707]  Okay, so this is about the micromanagement through the national sales tax that will be implemented through your driver's license.
[01:03:38.347 --> 01:03:45.210]  They're going to track everything you eat, drink, what you do, and then send social workers after you to incarcerate you over it.
[01:03:45.690 --> 01:03:46.550]  So, great points.
[01:03:46.610 --> 01:03:47.971]  I appreciate the call, David.
[01:03:48.691 --> 01:03:50.192]  It's control freak heaven.
[01:03:50.212 --> 01:03:50.932]  We'll be right back.
[01:03:54.833 --> 01:03:57.695]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[01:03:57.955 --> 01:03:59.536]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[01:03:59.876 --> 01:04:04.539]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[01:04:04.879 --> 01:04:11.623]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[01:04:11.943 --> 01:04:13.925]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has arisen.
[01:04:14.125 --> 01:04:16.988]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[01:04:17.088 --> 01:04:21.732]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[01:04:21.952 --> 01:04:26.336]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[01:04:26.596 --> 01:04:33.823]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[01:04:34.063 --> 01:04:36.485]  Discover the documentary for yourself before it's too late.

[01:04:55.535 --> 01:04:56.555]  The War on Terrorism.
[01:04:56.896 --> 01:04:59.677]  Will it be fought overseas, or will it affect us here at home?
[01:04:59.937 --> 01:05:04.098]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[01:05:04.519 --> 01:05:05.359]  So what do you do?
[01:05:05.679 --> 01:05:10.241]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[01:05:10.734 --> 01:05:12.855]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[01:05:13.335 --> 01:05:28.041]  Sheltering in Place, Surviving Acts of Terrorism from Biological, Chemical, and Radioactive Fallouts, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[01:05:28.081 --> 01:05:35.204]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.

[01:05:54.513 --> 01:05:58.875]  Did you know that heart disease is the number one killer of men and women in the United States?
[01:05:59.336 --> 01:06:05.799]  In fact, the National Cholesterol Education Program has reported that each year more than a million Americans have heart attacks.
[01:06:06.280 --> 01:06:08.401]  And about a half a million die from heart disease.
[01:06:08.821 --> 01:06:14.844]  Did you also know that the higher your blood cholesterol level, the greater your risk for developing heart disease or having a heart attack?
[01:06:15.404 --> 01:06:34.734]  At ResearchedHerbs.com, we are aware of the controversies surrounding the presumed safety of statin drugs in lowering cholesterol, which is why, as part of our ongoing commitment to your safety and health, we invite you to learn more about Google by Himalaya, a highly effective and extremely safe natural herbal supplement, widely recognized for its cholesterol-regulating properties.

[01:06:45.103 --> 01:06:45.303]  That's 1-800-845-3841.
[01:06:45.343 --> 01:06:47.765]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:02.025 --> 01:07:18.991]  This hour I want to talk a little bit about Google and every other major search engine company for that matter, or computer company for that matter, or infrastructure company for that matter, going into Communist China and saying, absolutely, we'll help you oppress your population.
[01:07:19.872 --> 01:07:20.952]  Let me just give you the news flash.
[01:07:21.736 --> 01:07:25.959]  Major search engines have already been caught red-handed doing that here in the United States.
[01:07:25.999 --> 01:07:31.463]  But we always like to look at another country and think, oh, it's all going on over there.
[01:07:31.563 --> 01:07:33.685]  No, it's already begun over here.
[01:07:33.745 --> 01:07:37.347]  So I want to try to give you a clear picture of that as it develops.
[01:07:38.888 --> 01:07:46.554]  And as I said at the first of the broadcast kicking off last hour, at kickoff there,
[01:07:47.615 --> 01:07:52.241]  That this entire military industrial complex is run by organized criminals.
[01:07:52.861 --> 01:07:56.546]  They are piratical, they are aggressive, they are tyrannical.
[01:07:57.507 --> 01:08:00.571]  They literally wage war against populations.
[01:08:00.931 --> 01:08:03.474]  They admittedly use these tactics in business.
[01:08:03.915 --> 01:08:07.419]  They use governments to come in and pass laws that restrict their competition.
[01:08:09.257 --> 01:08:22.727]  They openly are enemies of the family and of the nation-state and openly have World Economic Forums from Davos to Cape Town, South Africa, from Chicago, Illinois, to you name it.
[01:08:23.368 --> 01:08:33.335]  They have these meetings, they put out these policy reports, they go in and they fund the policies of governments through the IMF and World Bank that we as taxpayers fund ourselves.
[01:08:34.494 --> 01:08:40.476]  And they are using the war on terror to set up a domestic police state so they can move on to the next phase.
[01:08:40.496 --> 01:08:59.821]  They're putting this police state in place so they can do things to you that are very oppressive and abusive economically and psychologically because control and domination and order, as they call it, is their business and business is good.
[01:08:59.841 --> 01:09:00.981]  If you're a global corporation
[01:09:01.696 --> 01:09:06.098]  Forty-four of the hundred biggest economies are companies, not countries.
[01:09:07.178 --> 01:09:09.939]  Your business is monopolizing industries.
[01:09:10.059 --> 01:09:11.679]  It is buying off governments.
[01:09:11.799 --> 01:09:23.083]  It is having governments pass laws giving private corporations and their front groups, like the World Trade Organization and others, governmental powers.
[01:09:25.084 --> 01:09:31.006]  And I remember about seven years ago reading globalist policy reports that were public, but
[01:09:31.906 --> 01:09:55.474]  Very hard to get a hold of, and almost unknown, where they said, the people are going to wake up to the fact that we're creating a one world government, one world taxation, and are going to have a global one child policy, and are going to track every purchase and every sale everyone makes off of national ID cards that will then turn into and be standardized, already happening, into global ID cards.
[01:09:56.898 --> 01:09:59.640]  How are we going to manipulate the people into accepting it?
[01:09:59.700 --> 01:10:05.384]  First they said we're going to deny global governance, they call it governance, as long as possible.
[01:10:05.684 --> 01:10:09.726]  Then we're going to create a social stigma to criticizing it.
[01:10:10.707 --> 01:10:14.870]  Then we'll use classical political intimidation, i.e.
[01:10:14.910 --> 01:10:19.633]  we'll announce the Pentagon will come harass you and watch you if you criticize one of their actions.
[01:10:20.493 --> 01:10:21.714]  They'll create a chilling effect.
[01:10:22.518 --> 01:10:46.165]  And then, of course, finally, they talk about getting hate laws passed, which have nothing to do with stopping the Ku Klux Klan from burning crosses, and everything to do with restricting your free speech, my free speech, and that they would use terrorism as the control mechanism, as the excuse to then physically dominate the population.
[01:10:47.638 --> 01:10:49.560]  And that is exactly what they're doing.
[01:10:49.700 --> 01:10:55.545]  And they went on to say that we have to create a false left-right paradigm, or a false bipolar world.
[01:10:55.906 --> 01:11:03.372]  There is really a consortium, or an alliance, a confederacy, a commission.
[01:11:04.113 --> 01:11:06.675]  That's really the best way to describe it.
[01:11:07.056 --> 01:11:12.761]  You know, like in The Godfather, where you've got 14 families or so around that big conference table.
[01:11:13.698 --> 01:11:23.352]  They all have their own companies, their own operations, their own rackets, but they get together and decide on rules and territories and who is over what.
[01:11:23.393 --> 01:11:28.881]  A better analogy is the movie Rollerball, where Houston's the energy city and Tokyo's the
[01:11:30.277 --> 01:11:42.404]  Manufacturing City, and it's all these corporate leaders, and if the corporate cast wants your wife, even if you're Jonathan E., the top rollerball player, you know, they get to take your wife, because that's about power.
[01:11:42.864 --> 01:11:45.265]  Or it goes back to what you see in Braveheart, which is historical.
[01:11:45.325 --> 01:11:49.388]  Prima Nocte, the lord of the manor, wanted your wife on your wedding night.
[01:11:49.428 --> 01:11:50.408]  He got to have her first.
[01:11:50.428 --> 01:11:55.551]  If we can't kill the Scots, we'll breed them out, as Longshanks said.
[01:11:58.201 --> 01:11:59.161]  So this is the system.
[01:11:59.201 --> 01:12:06.965]  And so they said, we're going to have the liberal world government, at the point where everybody admits there's a world government, we'll deny as long as possible, then we'll give them a false choice.
[01:12:07.005 --> 01:12:10.866]  We'll say there's a liberal world government and there's a conservative world government.
[01:12:11.126 --> 01:12:17.649]  There's the loving, helpful UN world government that's sweet and doesn't like to attack people, but will if it has to.
[01:12:18.209 --> 01:12:21.972]  Then there's the evil Anglo-American establishment British U.S.
[01:12:22.052 --> 01:12:30.198]  world government who is right-wing and vicious and so we've got to have a liberal world government to counter that evil right-wing world government.
[01:12:31.199 --> 01:12:33.180]  And right there they've neutralized your choices.
[01:12:33.641 --> 01:12:37.984]  Both of the left and right are just arms on the same corporate PR system.
[01:12:38.605 --> 01:12:39.345]  You know, it's like the big
[01:12:41.337 --> 01:12:41.758]  Yes, we are.
[01:13:02.108 --> 01:13:02.788]  We're good to go!
[01:13:26.575 --> 01:13:28.877]  By one of our listeners last week.
[01:13:28.938 --> 01:13:29.338]  I'm sorry.
[01:13:29.358 --> 01:13:35.083]  I'm not up on the names that the worldwide Wrestling or is now WWE or whatever.
[01:13:35.143 --> 01:13:35.523]  It's called.
[01:13:35.984 --> 01:13:37.065]  It's not real.
[01:13:37.225 --> 01:13:39.867]  It's staged It's a fraud.
[01:13:39.907 --> 01:13:49.516]  It's a thespian theatrical Shakespearean event and these poor leftists many of them so well-meaning good people on average and
[01:13:50.453 --> 01:14:02.143]  They really think, well, the government's tyranny and they're building camps and Bush may become a dictator, and Bush is openly saying, maybe I should be a dictator, and maybe this is, you know, the powers I have, and the news is pushing it, and we're actually having a national debate about it!
[01:14:03.103 --> 01:14:04.324]  We shouldn't even be debating it!
[01:14:05.425 --> 01:14:12.411]  And, uh, but we just need to turn our guns into the men in the black uniforms, and then everything... Hitler was for gun control!
[01:14:12.711 --> 01:14:17.555]  You can't own a gun in Mexico, where you got a tiny elite controlling and enslaving the population!
[01:14:17.595 --> 01:14:18.756]  Same thing in Communist China!
[01:14:19.582 --> 01:14:28.726]  I mean, what you were told as part of your orthodoxy, part of your nomenclature, part of being who you are, that you've got to be anti-gun.
[01:14:29.907 --> 01:14:32.548]  Well, it's the same thing with these mindless Republican followers.
[01:14:32.588 --> 01:14:35.309]  A lot of them are just really good old boys.
[01:14:35.329 --> 01:14:40.111]  They'll stop and help you change your tire, and they give money to the local charity.
[01:14:40.932 --> 01:14:44.874]  Most of them really aren't bad people, but they are willfully ignorant.
[01:14:45.934 --> 01:14:48.137]  They feel good about themselves.
[01:14:48.197 --> 01:14:49.398]  They're the good guy.
[01:14:49.719 --> 01:14:50.860]  Halliburton's good.
[01:14:50.900 --> 01:14:52.042]  George Bush is good.
[01:14:52.282 --> 01:14:54.965]  And if George Bush says torture's good, then torture's good.
[01:14:55.225 --> 01:14:58.009]  And if George Bush says spying's good, then spying's good.
[01:14:58.289 --> 01:15:03.716]  And so some of the so-called best people out there are really warped, sick, camp-following freaks.
[01:15:06.639 --> 01:15:09.100]  And they're all for the American world government now.
[01:15:09.160 --> 01:15:10.701]  It isn't an American world government.
[01:15:10.901 --> 01:15:12.882]  The globalists openly funded the Soviets.
[01:15:12.902 --> 01:15:14.243]  That's now all declassified.
[01:15:14.583 --> 01:15:20.226]  Because they had to have a fake bipolar, that is dual world, to give you the illusion of choice.
[01:15:20.246 --> 01:15:20.946]  There is really
[01:15:22.206 --> 01:15:24.167]  One power, and that is the New World Order.
[01:15:24.427 --> 01:15:26.208]  The world government is already set up.
[01:15:26.608 --> 01:15:28.829]  Now it is just showing itself.
[01:15:28.909 --> 01:15:31.211]  Now it is expanding its control.
[01:15:31.311 --> 01:15:35.593]  Now it is firming up its control against its one real enemy.
[01:15:35.953 --> 01:15:41.736]  The few sovereign rogue nations that are left, and I'm not defending those nations, whether they're good, bad, indifferent, ugly,
[01:15:42.857 --> 01:15:43.999]  That isn't up for debate.
[01:15:44.039 --> 01:15:56.697]  The point is, this great evil has risen, and it's knocking off its last few areas that are under its total financial domination and military control, and it is now shifting
[01:15:58.642 --> 01:16:18.486]  Into the final mode of mopping up those handful of quote, rogue nations, and the Pentagon's new map, they admit all this, but their real thing that they're focused on is the individual, the individual bank account, the individual safety deposit box, the individual 401k, the individual pension fund, the individual ranch,
[01:16:18.826 --> 01:16:31.475]  The individual house, the family raising the children, the social architects openly, it's in their documents, openly talk about breaking up the family because the family owes allegiance to itself and not the state.
[01:16:31.875 --> 01:16:38.600]  That's why China is the model, ladies and gentlemen, where they are breaking up the family, where they do engage in all this.
[01:16:39.821 --> 01:16:41.082]  They get all the awards.
[01:16:41.482 --> 01:16:42.943]  You want to know what the government wants to do?
[01:16:43.003 --> 01:16:44.224]  It's what they do in China.
[01:16:44.284 --> 01:16:45.165]  They're the model.
[01:16:45.185 --> 01:16:48.187]  They're the apple of the New World Order's eye.
[01:16:49.580 --> 01:16:51.661]  And so you've got to unlearn what you've learned.
[01:16:51.681 --> 01:16:54.382]  You've got to change the labels they've given you.
[01:16:54.782 --> 01:16:59.144]  All the labels you've got today didn't exist 106 years ago.
[01:16:59.824 --> 01:17:17.272]  And the big foundations were formed 106 years ago and they openly said in published books and documents that they were going to buy up the chairs of the universities, they were going to buy up the endowments, they were going to buy up the curriculum, they were going to finance the textbooks, they were going to create the false left-right paradigm.
[01:17:18.985 --> 01:17:27.627]  And they have created the false left-right paradigm, where the only paradigm you need to ever know, the world view, that in my world view, it is the world view.
[01:17:28.507 --> 01:17:32.028]  I'm not giving you my world view, I'm giving you the world view.
[01:17:32.388 --> 01:17:36.489]  The world view is elite versus the individual.
[01:17:37.089 --> 01:17:40.610]  The world view is consolidated power versus the masses.
[01:17:41.670 --> 01:17:47.640]  And the elite has gotten, while giving you the false left right paradigm, they've also played off class warfare and the rest of this.
[01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:49.923]  And they've done it to turn us all against each other.
[01:17:49.983 --> 01:17:50.845]  Black against white.
[01:17:51.185 --> 01:17:52.086]  White against black.
[01:17:52.126 --> 01:17:53.288]  Hispanic against white.
[01:17:53.348 --> 01:17:54.190]  North against south.
[01:17:54.450 --> 01:17:55.572]  Woman against man.
[01:17:55.652 --> 01:17:56.754]  Kids against their parents.
[01:17:57.652 --> 01:17:58.573]  Oh, it's children.
[01:17:58.593 --> 01:18:02.576]  When you rebel against your parents, even if they are idiots, you are only helping the New World Order.
[01:18:02.956 --> 01:18:11.082]  When you don't learn to work hard and respect your parents and be involved and stay off drugs, and when you think it's cool to go out and do all the things that the media tells you is cool.
[01:18:11.143 --> 01:18:17.447]  Notice the media tells you drugs are cool out of Hollywood, but then puts a public service announcement in saying they're bad.
[01:18:17.768 --> 01:18:18.008]  You see,
[01:18:18.768 --> 01:18:21.309]  They know you'll be rebellious and go use their product.
[01:18:21.409 --> 01:18:22.690]  Don't use their drugs.
[01:18:22.990 --> 01:18:24.291]  Don't fall into their snare.
[01:18:24.591 --> 01:18:25.271]  Be strong.
[01:18:25.311 --> 01:18:25.931]  Be focused.
[01:18:25.971 --> 01:18:26.652]  Be motivated.
[01:18:26.692 --> 01:18:27.332]  Be involved.
[01:18:27.612 --> 01:18:28.493]  That's what they hate.
[01:18:28.793 --> 01:18:30.073]  That's truly rebellious.
[01:18:31.074 --> 01:18:34.495]  The real paradigm is freedom versus slavery.
[01:18:34.755 --> 01:18:43.879]  I don't restate the basic crux of what we're facing enough, so I restated it there, and I promise we'll go to Mark, Jason, Cliff, Steve, and many others when we get back after this quick break.
[01:18:44.260 --> 01:18:44.800]  Stay with us.
[01:18:45.783 --> 01:18:50.364]  We'll get into Google and all the rest of it, but I've been gone for five days and I'm in preaching mode.
[01:18:55.165 --> 01:18:59.666]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[01:19:00.006 --> 01:19:04.087]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[01:19:04.407 --> 01:19:04.947]  We listened.
[01:19:05.247 --> 01:19:10.228]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[01:19:10.508 --> 01:19:11.008]  We listened.
[01:19:11.368 --> 01:19:14.409]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[01:19:14.849 --> 01:19:15.369]  We listened.
[01:19:15.829 --> 01:19:19.891]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[01:19:20.272 --> 01:19:20.772]  We listened.
[01:19:21.112 --> 01:19:26.355]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[01:19:26.755 --> 01:19:28.116]  Again, we listened.
[01:19:28.496 --> 01:19:35.861]  Introducing the Berkey Light, the gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.
[01:19:36.241 --> 01:19:39.703]  Get the Berkey Light, the American water filter, for only $259 by calling
[01:19:44.770 --> 01:19:45.411]  That's toll free 888-803-4438.
[01:19:45.451 --> 01:19:46.353]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:19:54.900 --> 01:19:57.342]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[01:19:57.362 --> 01:20:05.188]  Did you know that one of the 45 objectives of international communism was to have America become involved in free trade?
[01:20:05.228 --> 01:20:15.116]  Without tariffs on cheaply produced foreign goods, our manufacturing base, which would not be able to compete, would be forced to move their manufacturing plants overseas or to Mexico.
[01:20:15.836 --> 01:20:22.021]  This would throw millions of workers out of work and completely destroy the middle class that has made America great.
[01:20:22.741 --> 01:20:30.404]  We'd like to help you understand how these things are coming to pass by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[01:20:53.673 --> 01:20:54.714]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:20:55.115 --> 01:21:00.601]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[01:21:01.182 --> 01:21:01.682]  That's right.
[01:21:02.003 --> 01:21:04.285]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[01:21:04.606 --> 01:21:11.774]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[01:21:12.313 --> 01:21:20.019]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[01:21:20.459 --> 01:21:25.323]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[01:21:25.943 --> 01:21:28.965]  If you'd like to take a look at gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[01:21:31.727 --> 01:21:35.868]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[01:21:36.249 --> 01:21:36.489]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:21:36.509 --> 01:21:38.449]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[01:21:38.509 --> 01:21:38.829]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:21:39.130 --> 01:21:39.670]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:21:39.690 --> 01:21:41.830]  Do you know the truth about breast cancer?
[01:21:41.850 --> 01:21:44.651]  Did you know that the race for the cure is over?
[01:21:59.252 --> 01:22:07.140]  The best-kept secret in the country today is that it is now possible to kill cancer without personal suffering, mutilation, and poisoning of your entire system.
[01:22:07.380 --> 01:22:10.023]  Now, it's cancer's turn to die with Lay's Med Inc.'

[01:23:02.378 --> 01:23:08.060]  Politics, it's really exciting, it's dynamic, it's the real world.
[01:23:09.061 --> 01:23:10.881]  It's our future, it's our destiny.
[01:23:11.241 --> 01:23:16.023]  They've made it boring, they've made it stupid, they've made it where nobody wants to pay attention to it.
[01:23:16.623 --> 01:23:21.885]  They have drug politicians through the mud on purpose with the politicians willingly playing the part.
[01:23:21.945 --> 01:23:30.548]  George Bush is just a front man, a puppet, to acclimate you, to wear you out where you've heard about checkpoints and martial law and dictators and
[01:23:31.963 --> 01:23:37.768]  All of this over and over and over again and torture until you just get tired of it and okay, fine.
[01:23:40.209 --> 01:23:41.891]  That's all that's happening here.
[01:23:42.371 --> 01:23:48.756]  And then the Democrats come into office and suddenly, you know, the Democrats love torture and suddenly, you know, Republicans are going to hate it.
[01:23:49.276 --> 01:23:51.538]  We've got to realize that we're being scammed here.
[01:23:52.398 --> 01:23:55.060]  I'm not saying all Democrats are bad or all Republicans are bad.
[01:23:55.100 --> 01:23:58.782]  I'm telling you though, committee chairman and above, you can forget it.
[01:23:58.922 --> 01:24:01.704]  Governors, I mean, they're bought and paid for, folks.
[01:24:02.565 --> 01:24:08.168]  Let's go ahead and talk to Mark in San Diego.
[01:24:08.208 --> 01:24:09.529]  You're on the air, Mark, go ahead.
[01:24:09.769 --> 01:24:14.012]  Hey, Alex, you're an army of one and the whole world appreciates it.
[01:24:15.034 --> 01:24:21.396]  Listen, you provoke me into calling because I don't want everything and everybody's blood on my hands, so I have to do my duty.
[01:24:21.716 --> 01:24:36.600]  And please, Mr. Alex, if you don't agree with what I have to say, and I go through this very quickly, if you don't have the ears to listen, my message goes out to everybody else, including Captain Joyce Riley and Derrick Brownsfield with his animals and stuff, Mad Cow Disease,
[01:24:37.308 --> 01:24:38.949]  Uh, bird flu, hoof and mouth.
[01:24:39.349 --> 01:24:41.090]  All these animals are dying needlessly.
[01:24:41.110 --> 01:24:42.851]  It's just a needless slaughter.
[01:24:42.871 --> 01:24:45.192]  Okay, well, sir, tell me what's going on, please.
[01:24:45.752 --> 01:24:47.553]  Well, okay, a couple of things, real quick.
[01:24:47.933 --> 01:24:50.214]  Alright, uh, I'm gonna give you, like, Hunter's Law.
[01:24:50.454 --> 01:24:51.454]  This will save your life.
[01:24:51.955 --> 01:25:02.900]  Um, whatever hydrogen peroxide, 35% food grade, uh, and colloidal silver together, you not kill or cure, then you need baking soda.
[01:25:03.360 --> 01:25:05.121]  And that will, like, include everything.
[01:25:05.741 --> 01:25:05.821]  Um,
[01:25:06.243 --> 01:25:06.483]  You know.
[01:25:06.723 --> 01:25:07.064]  Okay.
[01:25:07.564 --> 01:25:08.805]  I mean, kill or cure what?
[01:25:08.845 --> 01:25:11.006]  You're just... Well, anything.
[01:25:11.286 --> 01:25:15.049]  You know, like, for example, you have your allergies, okay?
[01:25:15.669 --> 01:25:18.171]  I can tell you right now, that's like basically an STD.
[01:25:18.191 --> 01:25:19.072]  That's an infection.
[01:25:19.312 --> 01:25:20.273]  Which is no big deal.
[01:25:20.613 --> 01:25:25.796]  But if you have your hydrogen peroxide, 35% food grade, and your colloidal silver, that'll be gone.
[01:25:25.856 --> 01:25:29.419]  But you need to, like, you know, inoculate your whole family all at the same time.
[01:25:29.799 --> 01:25:32.721]  Otherwise, it will simply, like, you know, ping pong back and forth.
[01:25:32.741 --> 01:25:34.562]  By inoculate, you mean drink or snort it.
[01:25:34.582 --> 01:25:35.383]  You don't mean inject it.
[01:25:35.976 --> 01:25:36.816]  Well, yeah, correct.
[01:25:37.236 --> 01:25:38.417]  And that includes Grandma.
[01:25:38.437 --> 01:25:42.218]  You guys all need to do it at the same time, otherwise you'll just simply re-infect each other.
[01:25:42.498 --> 01:25:46.679]  And I'd also suggest that you put... Yeah, but if I get run over by a truck, colloidal silver isn't going to save me.
[01:25:46.699 --> 01:25:48.600]  I mean, you're not saying it's, like, magical, are you?
[01:25:48.900 --> 01:25:49.840]  No, no, not at all.
[01:25:50.140 --> 01:25:51.361]  I'm talking about infection.
[01:25:51.641 --> 01:25:53.681]  In fact, like, you know, you should have, like, Ed McCabe on.
[01:25:53.701 --> 01:25:55.782]  He's the only guy that really knows what he's talking about.
[01:25:55.802 --> 01:25:56.382]  Okay, alright.
[01:25:56.542 --> 01:25:57.543]  What else is on your mind, sir?
[01:25:58.043 --> 01:25:58.623]  Okay, um...
[01:25:59.584 --> 01:26:02.025]  Uh, well, I could also tell you about like the chemtrails.
[01:26:02.185 --> 01:26:05.265]  Oh, I also have a cliche that you've been looking at for like, you know, for a few years.
[01:26:05.305 --> 01:26:06.766]  I'll give that to you after I'm finished.
[01:26:07.186 --> 01:26:12.907]  But like the chemtrails, they've been, um, uh, like, you know, covertly spraying that over.
[01:26:12.927 --> 01:26:15.588]  I live in, like, Golden Hill, and like, you know, I watch them.
[01:26:16.068 --> 01:26:28.811]  Uh, what they do is like, you know, they'll, like, the clouds come in over, like, the coast, and they'll parallel, like, the eastern leading edge, um, of the cloud, um, and also, like... Yeah, most of it's weather manipulation.
[01:26:29.665 --> 01:26:30.006]  Oh, right.
[01:26:30.046 --> 01:26:33.172]  Now, I believe that's what's affecting you guys in your burn zone.
[01:26:33.593 --> 01:26:35.938]  So, I just want to let you know that they're doing it covertly.
[01:26:35.978 --> 01:26:41.569]  For example, if the aircraft is perpendicular to the cloud, they'll just simply, you know, perpendicular... Here's the deal on the chemtrails.
[01:26:42.509 --> 01:26:56.077]  The government admits thousands and thousands of instances where they sprayed chemical, biological, and radiological out of fixed-wing and rotary-wing aircraft, helicopters and planes, and on cities, killing people.
[01:26:56.498 --> 01:26:57.298]  It's declassified.
[01:26:57.338 --> 01:26:57.818]  It's public.
[01:26:57.998 --> 01:26:59.519]  No caller has ever brought it up.
[01:27:00.540 --> 01:27:02.541]  Other talk shows rarely talk about it.
[01:27:04.162 --> 01:27:08.665]  And so the real admitted public stuff is absolutely unknown.
[01:27:09.446 --> 01:27:17.173]  And then I got people walking up to me on the street going, look at that jet spraying us down here, and it's at 35,000 feet, and it's an ice crystal trail.
[01:27:17.633 --> 01:27:31.685]  So my whole deal on the chemtrails and weather control is, yes, some of it's going on, I just never get why everybody obsesses on the areas that are all kind of nebulous, pun intended, instead of on all the admitted-in-your-face stuff.
[01:27:32.563 --> 01:27:34.144]  What I'm saying, I'm watching this stuff.
[01:27:34.184 --> 01:27:35.444]  I mean, they're doing it covertly.
[01:27:35.464 --> 01:27:37.786]  They're trying to camouflage it like they're not doing it.
[01:27:37.806 --> 01:27:38.466]  You know what I'm saying?
[01:27:38.826 --> 01:27:41.867]  They won't do it in the blue sky, but they'll do it right in the clouds.
[01:27:42.088 --> 01:27:43.208]  I don't know where you're at, buddy.
[01:27:43.268 --> 01:27:49.291]  I mean, you'll have a clear sky and jets will start flying around at 4,000 feet leaving trails that are there four hours later.
[01:27:49.311 --> 01:27:50.432]  Yeah, they don't do that here.
[01:27:51.192 --> 01:27:53.173]  But they are chemtrails because they don't disappear.
[01:27:53.493 --> 01:27:55.313]  But listen, I've got some other things to talk to you about.
[01:27:55.333 --> 01:27:56.494]  Well, we've got about 30 seconds.
[01:27:56.514 --> 01:27:57.474]  We've got a bunch of other callers.
[01:27:57.494 --> 01:27:57.874]  What else?
[01:27:58.094 --> 01:27:58.674]  OK, listen.
[01:27:58.894 --> 01:28:03.095]  OK, for your syphilitic herpes, your urinary tract infection, try baking soda.
[01:28:03.315 --> 01:28:13.397]  Whatever the hydrogen peroxide, 35% food grade, and colloidal silver does not kill or cure together, and that includes being overweight, then try baking soda.
[01:28:13.417 --> 01:28:17.218]  So you yourself have had these diseases, and it's just knocked it out for you.
[01:28:17.438 --> 01:28:17.958]  Oh, totally.
[01:28:18.078 --> 01:28:18.418]  Totally.
[01:28:18.478 --> 01:28:19.638]  I hit like the world, man.
[01:28:19.678 --> 01:28:21.119]  I go around like this.
[01:28:21.139 --> 01:28:22.119]  Listen, thanks for the call.
[01:28:22.879 --> 01:28:23.799]  Pretty fired up there.
[01:28:23.819 --> 01:28:25.460]  Thank God I haven't had those problems.
[01:28:25.480 --> 01:28:30.741]  I'm sure we've had some listeners who have, but I'm not going to try to practice medicine here on the air.
[01:28:30.781 --> 01:28:32.202]  But what a call!
[01:28:32.522 --> 01:28:34.002]  You never know what you'll hear next, folks.
[01:28:34.482 --> 01:28:36.783]  All right, we'll try to really ram through these calls when we get back.
[01:28:37.023 --> 01:28:39.164]  Cliff and Steve and Chris and many others.
[01:28:39.184 --> 01:28:39.824]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:28:39.864 --> 01:28:43.225]  PresentPlanet.tv.
[01:28:44.105 --> 01:28:45.005]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.485 --> 01:28:47.106]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:48.006 --> 01:28:50.687]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:54.238 --> 01:28:56.159]  You need your cup of coffee each morning, right?
[01:28:56.479 --> 01:28:58.220]  But you're not sure if it's right for your health.
[01:28:58.580 --> 01:28:59.821]  Now there's Gano Coffee.
[01:29:00.141 --> 01:29:04.823]  Gano Coffee is the new low-acid, low-caffeine, naturally healthy coffee.
[01:29:05.123 --> 01:29:13.287]  What makes Gano Coffee special is the secret ingredient Ganoderma, a concentration of red reishi mushroom, also known as the miraculous king of herbs.
[01:29:13.707 --> 01:29:17.190]  Known for its high nutritional value, Reishi packs a bigger punch than ginseng.

[01:30:06.721 --> 01:30:11.243]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem with a Black Berkey Purification Element.
[01:30:11.303 --> 01:30:22.647]  When used, water flows through the purification elements, where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[01:30:23.227 --> 01:30:30.068]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements, where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[01:30:30.468 --> 01:30:32.609]  Your purified water is now ready!
[01:30:33.109 --> 01:30:38.070]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 post-filter elements.

[01:31:14.481 --> 01:31:21.524]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.

[01:31:42.013 --> 01:31:42.973]  One more time that's 866-885-6625.
[01:32:02.402 --> 01:32:05.543]  Alright, that last caller was interesting, but I've got to move quicker here.
[01:32:05.563 --> 01:32:06.504]  We won't get to anybody.
[01:32:06.704 --> 01:32:12.926]  And I want to get more into this Google situation that the media is actually covering, but they're acting like it's kind of normal.
[01:32:12.966 --> 01:32:17.887]  Well, you know, censoring information with the government, teaming up with the government.
[01:32:18.247 --> 01:32:19.208]  Everybody does it.
[01:32:19.248 --> 01:32:20.228]  Maybe we should do it here.
[01:32:20.248 --> 01:32:22.369]  Well, I'm going to tell you the news behind the news on that.
[01:32:22.709 --> 01:32:24.990]  The rest of the story, as Paul Harvey likes to say.
[01:32:26.190 --> 01:32:27.310]  Jason in Maryland.
[01:32:27.330 --> 01:32:28.311]  You're on the air, Jason.
[01:32:28.331 --> 01:32:28.651]  Go ahead.
[01:32:29.432 --> 01:32:30.313]  Hi Alex, thanks.
[01:32:30.333 --> 01:32:31.373]  Thank you.
[01:32:31.513 --> 01:32:48.943]  There's a couple of numbers that are going to be real familiar to Bible students and that should make everyone sit up and take notice coming to a culmination of events here in the next year.
[01:32:49.783 --> 01:32:57.607]  For instance, the Israelis in the Six Day War, which was miraculous, I'm sure you know,
[01:32:59.471 --> 01:33:12.038]  took everything that was granted to Abraham and then righteously took this and then gave up the Temple Mount in 1967.
[01:33:12.599 --> 01:33:16.961]  The 40-year anniversary of that will be next year.
[01:33:16.981 --> 01:33:25.786]  The 400th anniversary of the founding of this country in as much as our first colony was established in 1607 will also take place
[01:33:29.523 --> 01:33:30.004]  I don't know.
[01:33:45.795 --> 01:33:46.836]  These are wild calls.
[01:33:46.976 --> 01:33:48.056]  They're just all over the map.
[01:33:48.076 --> 01:34:00.460]  Do you specifically have anything to say about any of the news I've covered, or any of the information, or just the spying, the torture, the China starting to dump the dollar, the dollar slide?
[01:34:00.740 --> 01:34:06.742]  Because, I mean, it's all interesting to hear about these dates that are coming up and stuff, but I'm trying to grasp exactly, I mean, what are you getting at?
[01:34:07.282 --> 01:34:10.963]  I'm getting at specifically the Daniel Project.
[01:34:10.983 --> 01:34:15.124]  Well, fill us in on the Daniel Project.
[01:34:15.604 --> 01:34:26.407]  The Daniel Project states that Israel has a very small window of opportunity to destroy Iran before they
[01:34:27.360 --> 01:34:34.766]  have nuclear capabilities, which I know from your study that that is not the case, that they're at least 10 years away from that.
[01:34:34.986 --> 01:34:39.149]  But that doesn't mean the globalists won't set one off, and then we're off the races.
[01:34:39.489 --> 01:34:44.133]  A huge world war just totally spiraling out of control.
[01:34:44.393 --> 01:34:45.013]  That's correct.
[01:34:45.093 --> 01:34:48.135]  So all of my comments, I think, are quite pertinent.
[01:34:48.916 --> 01:34:50.277]  They parted my land for gains.
[01:34:50.337 --> 01:34:51.398]  Sharon is in a coma.
[01:34:52.110 --> 01:34:53.111]  Israel is leaderless.
[01:34:53.151 --> 01:35:02.666]  They've got this Daniel Project that states now they want to do it by March, attack Iran, and that 40 years from 1967 and 400 years from 1607 I think is significant.
[01:35:06.694 --> 01:35:08.136]  Alright, well I appreciate your call.
[01:35:08.156 --> 01:35:11.018]  Interesting points there, Jason.
[01:35:11.378 --> 01:35:12.800]  Let's talk to Cliff in Utah.
[01:35:12.840 --> 01:35:13.580]  Cliff, go ahead.
[01:35:14.001 --> 01:35:14.561]  Good morning, Cliff.
[01:35:14.641 --> 01:35:15.822]  How are you doing there, Alex?
[01:35:15.842 --> 01:35:16.243]  Good, good.
[01:35:16.283 --> 01:35:16.663]  I'm fine.
[01:35:16.883 --> 01:35:22.228]  Okay, I'm the guy that your office was supposed to email you and give you my phone number, my personal phone number.
[01:35:23.029 --> 01:35:30.616]  Now, I've talked to Joyce Riley and also Pastor Butch about something and I've got to get back to them this coming Tuesday.
[01:35:31.215 --> 01:35:33.237]  And back to Joyce about appearing on her show.
[01:35:33.257 --> 01:35:33.837]  Okay.
[01:35:34.118 --> 01:35:35.419]  I need your fax number again.
[01:35:35.459 --> 01:35:36.880]  I had it, but I'm not at home base.
[01:35:36.940 --> 01:35:39.642]  I'd like to fax you all the... Let me put you on hold and they can give you that, sir.
[01:35:40.243 --> 01:35:41.183]  Anything else?
[01:35:41.784 --> 01:35:43.946]  I want to talk about Joan Dion.
[01:35:44.286 --> 01:35:46.908]  She's at the summit, you know, in Switzerland?
[01:35:47.028 --> 01:35:49.030]  Yes, the Big Davos World Economic Forum.
[01:35:49.310 --> 01:35:49.610]  Right.
[01:35:50.471 --> 01:35:56.236]  Bill Gates just donated $900 million to them people to start controlling this.
[01:35:57.537 --> 01:35:59.899]  And she has a phone number that people can get, you know, that...
[01:36:00.649 --> 01:36:08.519]  She'll send them a report on this in about 10 days and people really need to... because I listened to her on Joyce's show and it's something else.
[01:36:09.680 --> 01:36:16.669]  It's utterly fantastic what Bill Gates is donating all that money and what they're going to do, you know, taking over all the rural countries and that.
[01:36:17.489 --> 01:36:18.129]  That's what they're doing.
[01:36:18.169 --> 01:36:18.930]  Thanks for the call.
[01:36:19.470 --> 01:36:27.013]  In fact, the Davos Economic Forum's going on, World Economic Forum's going on right now, and you can read the minutes.
[01:36:27.193 --> 01:36:35.137]  You can go online and read the news reports, or you can go online and just type Bill Gates' speech, Davos 2006.
[01:36:35.997 --> 01:36:37.558]  The whole thing will pop up for you for free.
[01:36:38.438 --> 01:36:41.139]  And you can read what he's calling for and what they're doing.
[01:36:41.679 --> 01:36:52.344]  And it is one world government and how to engineer the governments to basically feed the population's wealth and energies into their coffers.
[01:36:52.644 --> 01:36:54.285]  That's the name of the game.
[01:36:55.225 --> 01:36:57.406]  Let's go ahead and take another call here.
[01:36:57.606 --> 01:36:58.106]  Steve.
[01:36:58.566 --> 01:37:00.167]  Steve is calling from Colorado.
[01:37:00.207 --> 01:37:00.827]  Welcome, Steve.
[01:37:01.307 --> 01:37:02.428]  Yeah, hi there, Alex.
[01:37:02.448 --> 01:37:04.329]  I have three questions for you.
[01:37:05.349 --> 01:37:07.590]  Yesterday, I only caught a part of the show
[01:37:08.769 --> 01:37:11.991]  What was the name of the Canadian doctor that you had on?
[01:37:12.011 --> 01:37:18.355]  I was out of town yesterday and I requested the network air a particular show.
[01:37:18.395 --> 01:37:19.495]  They did not air it.
[01:37:19.595 --> 01:37:22.237]  I guess they didn't have it or it malfunctioned.
[01:37:22.257 --> 01:37:24.218]  So I don't know what show aired yesterday.
[01:37:25.058 --> 01:37:25.699]  Oh, I see.
[01:37:25.959 --> 01:37:26.299]  Okay.
[01:37:27.099 --> 01:37:29.441]  Can you give me some specifics?
[01:37:29.601 --> 01:37:30.561]  Oh, sure.
[01:37:30.601 --> 01:37:32.402]  He was talking about weather control.
[01:37:32.422 --> 01:37:37.545]  I believe he said he was employed by... Yes, it's Ben Livingston.
[01:37:39.575 --> 01:37:47.521]  And he's not a doctor, he's a meteorologist and cloud physicist who was the head of the U.S.
[01:37:47.641 --> 01:38:07.575]  Navy's weather war program and was the first individual to ever employ weather weapons and that was in Southeast Asia or Vietnam back in the mid and late 1960s and he joined us and if you go to InfoWars.com there is an article about the interview
[01:38:08.440 --> 01:38:17.527]  And there's also mainstream news articles, from Fox News to articles out of Midland, Texas, about some of the things that he and others have discussed.
[01:38:17.567 --> 01:38:27.614]  But whether control is real, is patented, does work, and they can knock out those hurricanes, but the government has decided not to, and they've decided to let them hit.
[01:38:27.934 --> 01:38:37.081]  And Mr. Livingston says it's because, obviously, the federal government likes being able to hand out $200 billion with Katrina to their buddies, like Halliburton.
[01:38:37.461 --> 01:38:40.443]  Yeah, it's just, once again, it's just more control.
[01:38:40.463 --> 01:38:49.670]  And then, when you were on Coast to Coast a week and a half ago or so, you mentioned an advisor to the President by the name, I think it was John Yoo?
[01:38:49.690 --> 01:38:49.750]  Yes.
[01:38:50.611 --> 01:38:51.932]  Is that right?
[01:38:52.032 --> 01:38:53.353]  How are you spelling his last name?
[01:38:54.133 --> 01:38:55.154]  Y-O-O.
[01:38:56.175 --> 01:38:57.376]  Okay, Y-O-O.
[01:38:57.776 --> 01:39:01.939]  Okay, and you had mentioned also that he had made a speech somewhere
[01:39:02.509 --> 01:39:06.011]  Talking about we can abuse children and all that kind of stuff?
[01:39:06.051 --> 01:39:06.232]  Yes.
[01:39:06.392 --> 01:39:07.592]  Where was that at, you know?
[01:39:07.873 --> 01:39:27.786]  Yes, that was at the Council on Foreign Relations Chicago branch and that was given and it was in a debate with the Notre Dame professor, Mr. Castle, who we had on last week and there was a clandestine recording made in the meeting because those are non-disclosure meetings.
[01:39:28.386 --> 01:39:48.264]  And he read from a memo that Mr. Yu had written, that had also been signed off on by another White House counsel, that said we can commit genocide, and the President literally is God, and can order genocide, or the government can torture small children in front of their parents, quote, and crush their testicles.
[01:39:48.804 --> 01:39:52.367]  And I'm sorry to have to talk like that, but that is what the President signed off on.
[01:39:52.727 --> 01:39:57.951]  And those are the memos that were given to the Pentagon brass, and they do torture children in front of their parents.
[01:39:58.272 --> 01:40:00.093]  That's in General Tagumba's own report.
[01:40:00.133 --> 01:40:01.594]  Just type in Army Report on Torture.
[01:40:01.614 --> 01:40:02.675]  You'll get MSNBC.
[01:40:03.075 --> 01:40:05.777]  It is the main Google thing that comes up at least last time I checked.
[01:40:06.518 --> 01:40:13.383]  And you can go read the Army's own report, where they actually torture people to death, and they also torture their children in front of them.
[01:40:14.464 --> 01:40:14.845]  Okay.
[01:40:23.984 --> 01:40:30.127]  Yes, we've aired clips of it here on the radio, and there are links on prisonplanet.com.
[01:40:30.528 --> 01:40:38.973]  You'll have to go back to the archives about two weeks ago when that story first broke, or last, what, Thursday I interviewed Mr. Castle, the professor that debated you,
[01:40:40.033 --> 01:40:42.053]  And that is all there on the website, sir.
[01:40:42.494 --> 01:40:42.754]  Okay.
[01:40:43.294 --> 01:40:44.514]  I'm glad you called about that.
[01:40:44.534 --> 01:40:48.115]  I'm glad listeners are concerned about that, because I've been very upset about that.
[01:40:48.135 --> 01:40:55.876]  You know, we have Alberto Gonzalez, who was White House counsel, one of the White House lawyers, and now, of course, he's Attorney General, saying that Bush is the law.
[01:40:55.936 --> 01:40:59.597]  He is above all laws, and that they can torture people to death.
[01:41:00.697 --> 01:41:05.098]  Well, you know, it's so good that we have such
[01:41:06.144 --> 01:41:06.864]  Of course!
[01:41:24.291 --> 01:41:25.552]  It's all conditioning.
[01:41:25.592 --> 01:41:43.145]  Just every, 24, every major show, torture, every episode, torture's good, torture children in front of their parents almost every episode, and then magically, right at the same time, the President's got his people saying it, and it sounds crazy and weird, but then you hear Neocon talk show host
[01:41:44.122 --> 01:41:46.923]  Promoting how it's good and equating it with safety.
[01:41:47.144 --> 01:41:51.145]  You'll be safe as long as you let us have Ted Bundy powers.
[01:41:52.046 --> 01:42:01.731]  Just give us your guns, give us control of your bank accounts, let us track everything you do, let us run your life, and then Al Qaeda won't get you.
[01:42:02.391 --> 01:42:04.452]  Torturing children equals freedom.
[01:42:05.092 --> 01:42:06.773]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:42:06.873 --> 01:42:09.454]  Once again, it's 1984 coming to pass.
[01:42:09.995 --> 01:42:10.795]  The last question,
[01:42:11.283 --> 01:42:17.869]  You had mentioned also that the Manhattan Project and SDI were kind of hatched out of Bohemian Grove.
[01:42:18.629 --> 01:42:22.052]  Do you have an article on that at your website?
[01:42:22.072 --> 01:42:22.132]  Yes.
[01:42:22.332 --> 01:42:23.734]  Did you get that?
[01:42:23.954 --> 01:42:24.514]  Okay, you do?
[01:42:24.794 --> 01:42:31.100]  Yeah, there's a whole constellation of flotilla places, but the University of California at Berkeley
[01:42:32.209 --> 01:42:47.864]  is a quasi-official mouthpiece of the summer encampment of the San Francisco-based Bohemian Club that's held in a 2,700-acre redwood grove inside a mountainous gorge right outside Montereo, California.
[01:42:49.546 --> 01:42:54.851]  And if you can simply go to their website, and there's papers that have been released
[01:42:55.712 --> 01:42:57.033]  By the Grove to them.
[01:42:57.133 --> 01:43:09.299]  There are the published speeches that they themselves have released on a selective basis, where they brag about how they hatched the Manhattan Project there and how they launched SDI there.
[01:43:10.160 --> 01:43:13.001]  And it's all available as part of the public record.
[01:43:13.662 --> 01:43:15.743]  Actually, do you have time, could I ask one more question?
[01:43:16.243 --> 01:43:16.483]  Sure.
[01:43:17.103 --> 01:43:21.766]  Okay, that London, back in London when they had the supposed bombers,
[01:43:22.322 --> 01:43:24.444]  And it was during the summertime.
[01:43:24.464 --> 01:43:26.927]  July 7th and July 21st.
[01:43:27.588 --> 01:43:36.857]  And you had mentioned that, well the story that we got was that some kid was wearing a trench coat, you know a heavy overcoat, and that he had jumped the turnstiles.
[01:43:36.917 --> 01:43:42.303]  And I remember you saying something about that that was, since you had gone over there
[01:43:42.959 --> 01:43:44.940]  That that was a false story.
[01:43:45.680 --> 01:43:47.921]  Did you do a write-up at all on that?
[01:43:47.961 --> 01:43:48.401]  Do you remember?
[01:43:49.042 --> 01:43:51.283]  We wrote a bunch of articles about it, but we don't need to.
[01:43:51.503 --> 01:43:53.003]  It was all over the news.
[01:43:53.463 --> 01:43:55.864]  First, he was shot 3 times, 4 times, 8 times.
[01:43:55.904 --> 01:43:57.585]  It was a total of 14 shots.
[01:44:00.046 --> 01:44:01.887]  Mr. Menendez did not run.
[01:44:03.608 --> 01:44:04.508]  He walked.
[01:44:04.588 --> 01:44:05.789]  He was not wearing a jacket.
[01:44:06.029 --> 01:44:07.269]  He was wearing a blue jean shirt.
[01:44:08.090 --> 01:44:08.870]  It was 60 degrees.
[01:44:10.699 --> 01:44:17.583]  He walked and he walked on and sat down and they walked on board and he seemed to know them and was afraid.
[01:44:17.903 --> 01:44:27.089]  They sat on him and shot him 14 times until his entire head was actually like a pumpkin you'd shot 14 times.
[01:44:27.109 --> 01:44:28.009]  There was no head.
[01:44:28.389 --> 01:44:31.411]  It was a huge splattered bag.
[01:44:31.551 --> 01:44:33.332]  Just strips of flesh flopping around.
[01:44:33.353 --> 01:44:37.655]  It was some special forces military branch assigned to the police.
[01:44:37.675 --> 01:44:38.816]  It was an assassination.
[01:44:39.794 --> 01:44:50.140]  And they then admitted that he did not run, and he did not jump turn styles, that were not a trench coat, that were not wires sticking out, and that this was the eyewitnesses.
[01:44:50.180 --> 01:44:51.021]  They executed him.
[01:44:51.801 --> 01:44:56.243]  Yeah, well, thank you once again, Alex, and Godspeed to you.
[01:44:56.404 --> 01:44:57.224]  Well, thank you, my friend.
[01:44:57.464 --> 01:45:04.228]  I'm actually making a film about a bunch of different issues, and about ten minutes of the film is about that.
[01:45:06.549 --> 01:45:07.610]  And it's just horrible.
[01:45:08.977 --> 01:45:12.538]  It is just absolutely horrible to have this type of stuff going on.
[01:45:12.558 --> 01:45:12.738]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:45:12.758 --> 01:45:12.818]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:45:12.838 --> 01:45:14.039]  Tim in Ohio, you're on the air, welcome.
[01:45:14.059 --> 01:45:14.919]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[01:45:25.859 --> 01:45:32.084]  Oh, Captain, my Captain, I wanted to ask you a question about this paper I came across, uh, Silent Weapons for Quiet Wars.
[01:45:32.184 --> 01:45:33.985]  Colonel, uh, Alexander.
[01:45:34.386 --> 01:45:35.126]  Scary stuff.
[01:45:35.546 --> 01:45:35.827]  Yes.
[01:45:36.067 --> 01:45:36.827]  Everything.
[01:45:37.108 --> 01:45:43.012]  I can't believe that that far ago they were talking about barcodes and, um, well, just, uh, slavery, genocide.
[01:45:43.512 --> 01:45:49.357]  And one quick question about this trans strike that they had in New York City.
[01:45:50.020 --> 01:45:50.300]  Yes.
[01:45:50.780 --> 01:45:57.483]  Do you think that they were using that to shut the place down, to get down there and hotwire it the way they pre-wired the buildings for 9-11?
[01:45:58.783 --> 01:46:02.145]  You know, that's speculation, but that's exactly how the globalists operate.
[01:46:03.285 --> 01:46:09.547]  In the past, they did use shutdowns and renovations and terror drills to plant bombs in the buildings, we know that.
[01:46:11.208 --> 01:46:15.410]  They had multiple floors shut down in the weeks before 9-11.
[01:46:15.970 --> 01:46:19.131]  For electrical inspections or something like that wasn't that the excuse?
[01:46:19.580 --> 01:46:19.921]  Yes.
[01:46:20.201 --> 01:46:28.916]  And I wish there was a way that real people could go down there and inspect all of those subway lines because I'm afraid that something bad is going to happen there.
[01:46:30.211 --> 01:46:32.853]  No, it's terrible.
[01:46:32.933 --> 01:46:34.034]  And again, who has the motive?
[01:46:34.054 --> 01:46:34.795]  Who will get power?
[01:46:34.835 --> 01:46:35.776]  Who will get control?
[01:46:36.216 --> 01:46:37.437]  If there's more terror attacks.
[01:46:37.957 --> 01:46:46.805]  The White House's own memo is now public from a few months ago where they say, barring another major terror attack, their agenda is stalled and may go into retrograde.
[01:46:46.825 --> 01:46:48.206]  They may actually get impeached.
[01:46:48.546 --> 01:46:50.187]  And I have that in the news today as well.
[01:46:50.528 --> 01:46:51.889]  Thank you for the call, Tim.
[01:46:52.229 --> 01:46:54.130]  I miss the name of the next caller from Seattle.
[01:46:55.411 --> 01:46:56.472]  Andy in Seattle.
[01:46:56.512 --> 01:46:56.873]  Welcome.
[01:46:57.813 --> 01:46:58.234]  Hi Alex.
[01:46:58.854 --> 01:46:58.934]  Hi.
[01:46:59.235 --> 01:46:59.635]  Happy to be back.
[01:47:00.257 --> 01:47:01.837]  I just got a quick question for you.
[01:47:02.337 --> 01:47:05.718]  You and I think alike on probably 99% of the issues you bring up.
[01:47:06.758 --> 01:47:15.660]  There's one I wanted to get a little bit further clarification from you on though and the gentleman a couple calls earlier from you was referring to and that's on the weather control issue.
[01:47:17.061 --> 01:47:27.523]  And obviously we know our government does very poorly when it tries to control the currency and everything else out there that they try to control that they have no constitutional authority to do.
[01:47:28.570 --> 01:47:34.180]  I was just trying to grasp why you think they have the authority to control weather and why that would be a good thing.
[01:47:36.904 --> 01:47:46.907]  Number one, the average American doesn't know that weather manipulation is real and has been used and has been demonstrated to be effective when they try to employ it.
[01:47:46.947 --> 01:47:52.908]  Now there could be tertiary side effects or butterfly effects and that's all open for debate and study.
[01:47:53.368 --> 01:47:59.730]  It's just to ignore an entire science when it exists and is being employed is bad.
[01:48:01.110 --> 01:48:05.351]  Okay, it's like talking about the NSA for a decade when the average American didn't even know it existed.
[01:48:05.371 --> 01:48:08.392]  I mean, people would send me giggling emails going, there's no such thing.
[01:48:08.812 --> 01:48:12.653]  When it was publicly there and you could go drive by it in Virginia.
[01:48:13.853 --> 01:48:15.073]  The National Security Agency.
[01:48:15.593 --> 01:48:18.694]  So, I mean, so much of this is just denying the elephant in the front room.
[01:48:19.874 --> 01:48:23.055]  I think that's open for debate on whether they should control the weather.
[01:48:23.095 --> 01:48:27.436]  But I think when you've got a Category 5 going at New Orleans, and you know you can send
[01:48:28.036 --> 01:48:28.697]  We're good to go.
[01:48:45.007 --> 01:48:46.588]  And it might have some side effect.
[01:48:46.628 --> 01:48:47.829]  We'll see what happens with that.
[01:48:47.869 --> 01:48:50.972]  They say they haven't done that because they are worried about liability.
[01:48:50.992 --> 01:48:52.353]  Look, the globalists aren't worried about it.
[01:48:52.833 --> 01:48:56.957]  If they want to tell somebody or block the courts or manipulate it, they can do that if they want.
[01:48:57.998 --> 01:48:59.459]  So give me your view on this, Andy.
[01:49:00.390 --> 01:49:07.377]  Well, I'm not saying you're wrong, it's just I'm very skeptical when it comes to putting that kind of trust and power in government.
[01:49:08.478 --> 01:49:12.503]  Obviously... Well, obviously, listen, they're evil so they didn't do it.
[01:49:12.583 --> 01:49:14.685]  I mean, I agree, we can't trust them to do it.
[01:49:15.065 --> 01:49:19.630]  The point is, is that when they claim that they did all they could with Seattle, we know it's bull.
[01:49:21.888 --> 01:49:26.870]  I mean, of course they can control the borders and keep us safe from terrorism.
[01:49:27.110 --> 01:49:29.071]  But terrorism doesn't exist to begin with.
[01:49:29.451 --> 01:49:34.353]  So my only point about the borders not being controlled is to show how the whole premise is a fraud.
[01:49:36.093 --> 01:49:38.654]  We're going to have checkpoints in Ohio with the military.
[01:49:39.614 --> 01:49:40.735]  News 8 coming up.
[01:49:41.753 --> 01:49:42.173]  Five.
[01:49:42.753 --> 01:49:45.234]  But we're not going to have military checkpoints on the border.
[01:49:45.274 --> 01:49:47.494]  Does that answer your question, Andy?
[01:49:47.534 --> 01:49:48.754]  Well, yeah.
[01:49:48.934 --> 01:49:52.375]  I think I put my trust and faith in the good Lord before I went to government.
[01:49:52.615 --> 01:49:53.015]  I hear you.
[01:49:53.075 --> 01:49:53.575]  I agree with you.
[01:49:53.915 --> 01:49:58.256]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:49:58.436 --> 01:50:02.857]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:50:03.017 --> 01:50:07.398]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:50:07.438 --> 01:50:08.758]  The New World Order.
[01:50:09.578 --> 01:50:10.499]  Panama!
[01:50:10.579 --> 01:50:14.781]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:50:14.861 --> 01:50:21.784]  We rip the sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:50:21.904 --> 01:50:23.945]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:50:24.305 --> 01:50:34.630]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:50:34.930 --> 01:50:37.671]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new
[01:50:37.751 --> 01:50:38.993]  This is a two and a half hour video.
[01:50:39.033 --> 01:50:40.295]  Police Day 3 is for you!

[01:50:53.758 --> 01:50:57.642]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[01:50:57.882 --> 01:51:03.307]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[01:51:03.587 --> 01:51:13.957]  Ideal for travel or outdoor events and perfect in the event of hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies because they remove both harmful chemicals and pathogenic bacteria from water.
[01:51:14.117 --> 01:51:18.461]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:51:18.641 --> 01:51:27.066]  Trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as Atrazine, Benzene, Chlorine, Chloroform, and NTBE are removed to below detectable limits.
[01:51:27.266 --> 01:51:33.650]  They reduce nitrate and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, aluminum, copper, and foul tastes like chlorine and sulfur odors.
[01:51:33.750 --> 01:51:38.232]  Yet the Black Berkey filter elements leave in the helpful and beneficial minerals that your body needs.

[01:52:10.413 --> 01:52:10.813]  I think so.
[01:52:30.708 --> 01:52:31.088]  I think so.
[01:52:58.701 --> 01:53:00.603]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:53:01.083 --> 01:53:03.886]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:06.309 --> 01:53:22.044]  The White House is starting to put out feelers to some of their minions in the media and there's reports out there concerned about impeachment hearings heating up in the Congress and now it's been openly talked about in the last two or three weeks on some of the nightly news shows.
[01:53:22.933 --> 01:53:24.994]  I want to get into that some of the next hour.
[01:53:25.014 --> 01:53:26.134]  I also want to cover Google.
[01:53:26.515 --> 01:53:30.596]  But let's continue with your phone calls, because we're actually moving at a nice, brisk pace here.
[01:53:30.876 --> 01:53:32.097]  Let's go really fast right now.
[01:53:32.517 --> 01:53:36.399]  Chris in Florida, I'm told, disagrees with me about something, so we'll put him to the head of the line.
[01:53:36.799 --> 01:53:37.699]  Go ahead, Chris.
[01:53:37.719 --> 01:53:38.220]  You're on the air.
[01:53:39.300 --> 01:53:39.620]  Hey, Alex.
[01:53:39.900 --> 01:53:46.723]  It's a very minor issue, but it's still a matter of semantics, basically, and it's really no criticism.
[01:53:47.123 --> 01:53:50.585]  It's just that the term occultism or occult
[01:53:51.563 --> 01:53:53.084]  That just means hidden, yeah.
[01:53:53.584 --> 01:53:53.864]  Right.
[01:53:54.285 --> 01:54:08.312]  Yeah, I'm sure you knew that, but I'm someone who is aware, and you could consider yourself someone who's into occultism just because you study it, but there are many... You know, actually, technically, yes.
[01:54:09.112 --> 01:54:17.496]  Even studying the New World Order to understand what they're up to, then you could say that I'm into the occult.
[01:54:19.994 --> 01:54:30.662]  I am too, by necessity, but I'm also someone who would consider myself New Age or somebody who is interested in healing myself and others.
[01:54:30.742 --> 01:54:35.025]  But there are things that are hidden that are hidden on purpose, which is what you talk about.
[01:54:36.466 --> 01:54:38.728]  Well, science has shown there's so much that we didn't know.
[01:54:38.748 --> 01:54:41.010]  I mean, magic is simply everything 50 years in the future.
[01:54:41.030 --> 01:54:46.734]  I mean, somebody 100 years ago would look at our technology today and it would be indistinguishable from magic to them.
[01:55:04.184 --> 01:55:28.094]  Right, so I'm just more interested in calling, I call myself an occultist, but those who are in government, I think you and Tex Mars have shown so well, that they're involved in black magic and that involves rituals and that involves drawing a blood, but I'm mainly interested, myself and as you are,
[01:55:29.101 --> 01:55:35.244]  In preventing people from the need to be healed in the first place.
[01:55:35.364 --> 01:55:37.105]  You know, preventing the pain from happening.
[01:55:37.125 --> 01:55:39.246]  And that's what I compliment you so well on.
[01:55:39.286 --> 01:55:44.708]  But I also wanted to bring up the issue of FEJA, Fully Informed Jury Association.
[01:55:45.709 --> 01:55:47.690]  If that could be mentioned once in a while.
[01:55:47.710 --> 01:55:50.091]  I've been thinking, I mean, he's getting up there in age.
[01:55:50.151 --> 01:55:52.112]  I need to get its founder, Red Beckman, back on.
[01:55:52.172 --> 01:55:52.812]  Thanks for the call.
[01:55:53.092 --> 01:55:54.573]  Let me just say this again, I'm a Christian.
[01:55:55.453 --> 01:55:56.934]  And I really believe in God.
[01:55:56.974 --> 01:55:58.795]  I mean, I have a personal relationship.
[01:55:59.415 --> 01:56:04.778]  But then I get so embarrassed by what the supposed Christian Church is and what it promotes.
[01:56:04.838 --> 01:56:05.758]  But that's what Christ said.
[01:56:05.778 --> 01:56:08.680]  He said, I mean, the devils are in the church pews, folks.
[01:56:08.700 --> 01:56:09.800]  They're up there on the podium.
[01:56:09.820 --> 01:56:15.383]  They're the Pharisees and the Sadducees and the rest of these people that use it as a way to control people.
[01:56:16.324 --> 01:56:20.286]  But, you know, it's like Tex Marston on the air last week, or I guess it was two weeks ago now.
[01:56:21.866 --> 01:56:23.488]  You know, that he is a symbologist.
[01:56:23.908 --> 01:56:25.029]  He studies symbols.
[01:56:25.490 --> 01:56:27.892]  But that doesn't mean that he is an occultist.
[01:56:28.152 --> 01:56:29.394]  He has studied the occult.
[01:56:30.315 --> 01:56:37.682]  And so I guess by the true definition of semantics, that does mean that you're kind of into the occult, because that's all the occult is, is the things that are hidden.
[01:56:38.723 --> 01:56:45.130]  But I do not practice the occult, so it gets off into a whole bunch of other... which a lot of these Christian churches do.
[01:56:45.876 --> 01:56:50.339]  This thing where pray for it and believe on it and be positive and it'll happen and it's just all that.
[01:56:50.379 --> 01:56:51.359]  I mean, it's just crazy.
[01:56:51.699 --> 01:56:53.300]  And then you get way off into it.
[01:56:53.340 --> 01:56:55.782]  That's why I don't really get a lot into that stuff here.
[01:56:56.962 --> 01:57:01.885]  We just cover what the elite is into and what they're up to because as a newsman, that is real.
[01:57:01.925 --> 01:57:04.267]  That is one of the driving things in our society.
[01:57:05.307 --> 01:57:08.249]  Well, I meant to take more than one call that segment, but that was an interesting call.
[01:57:08.329 --> 01:57:11.791]  We'll come back and talk to Chris and Chad and Steve and Walt.
[01:57:12.637 --> 01:57:15.418]  We've got guests coming up, and I just want to have the guests on for about one segment.
[01:57:16.119 --> 01:57:28.764]  And they're a member of the Houston Global Awareness Collective, a Houston-based anti-Halliburton group that was spied on by the top-secret Pentagon Counterintelligence Agency for giving out peanut butter and jelly sandwiches to Halliburton employees.
[01:57:29.384 --> 01:57:30.665]  So that's coming up as well.
[01:57:30.705 --> 01:57:31.265]  Stay with us.
[01:57:33.566 --> 01:57:38.468]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNLive.com or call toll free 877-300-7645.
[01:57:50.026 --> 01:57:50.666]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.327 --> 01:57:52.407]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:53.107 --> 01:57:54.247]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.267 --> 01:57:55.687]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.428 --> 01:57:57.408]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:58.008 --> 01:58:01.949]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.189 --> 01:58:06.330]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:07.430 --> 01:58:10.291]  Alright, we've got guests here in just a few minutes.
[01:58:10.591 --> 01:58:17.192]  Just a local group protesting Halliburton, so the Pentagon started spying on them and watching them and taking photos of them.
[01:58:18.228 --> 01:58:21.749]  And then we'll get back into all the new spying news that's coming out.
[01:58:22.210 --> 01:58:26.751]  Well, federal law says it's illegal, but we're just going to do it because the President's above the law.
[01:58:27.412 --> 01:58:34.154]  And also Google helping restrict the Chinese population from being able to truly surf the Internet.
[01:58:34.174 --> 01:58:35.535]  That's already going on here domestically.
[01:58:35.575 --> 01:58:36.695]  I want to talk about that as well.
[01:58:36.715 --> 01:58:45.599]  And some more Iran-Syria invasion news or bombing news that we need to cover that is coming up.
[01:58:46.725 --> 01:58:50.809]  Right now, let's go ahead and talk to Chris in Illinois.
[01:58:50.849 --> 01:58:51.510]  Chris, welcome.
[01:58:51.750 --> 01:58:55.133]  Hey, I've got a much lighter question to ask you.
[01:58:55.213 --> 01:59:08.665]  Barack Obama is opening an office here in Moline, Illinois, and he's going to give a speech here in about an hour and 15 minutes, and I was just wondering, I was going to ask him, he's a member of the CFR, I was going to ask him if there
[01:59:09.451 --> 01:59:22.136]  There's still their stated goal is one world government, but I was wondering if you had anything that I... Well, for those that don't know, why don't you tell folks who Barack Obama is?
[01:59:22.296 --> 01:59:24.897]  He is the... He's the senator from Illinois.
[01:59:26.357 --> 01:59:27.258]  And... A Democrat.
[01:59:27.578 --> 01:59:27.918]  Yeah.
[01:59:28.198 --> 01:59:29.639]  And, I mean, I know he was a senator.
[01:59:29.839 --> 01:59:31.539]  I don't know a whole lot about him.
[01:59:31.699 --> 01:59:32.119]  Oh, you don't?
[01:59:32.320 --> 01:59:32.620]  Okay.
[01:59:32.780 --> 01:59:36.921]  To show my ignorance, well, I mean, there's a hundred of them, but tell us about Barack Obama.
[01:59:37.141 --> 01:59:38.602]  Well, he seems to be
[01:59:39.477 --> 02:00:03.536]  Just, he, like, he was down here, our, our, we got an arsenal here, um, where they were talking about closing it about, I don't know, six months ago, and him and our governor were, were right down here, like, totally saying, no, we're not gonna let them take, not gonna let them close this, you know, thing, but we ended up losing 2,000 jobs.
[02:00:04.477 --> 02:00:07.680]  But, uh, from what I know about him, he seems to be,
[02:00:08.931 --> 02:00:18.032]  He seems to have the country's best interests, you know, and defends them, but he is a member of CFR and I'm...
[02:00:19.065 --> 02:00:22.886]  I'm going to, before I go down there, I'm going to totally do like a big study on this.
[02:00:22.906 --> 02:00:31.968]  Well, I would ask him, I mean, I would say once George Bush is out of office, you know, are suddenly the Democrats going to try to reverse any of this?
[02:00:32.068 --> 02:00:32.988]  Oh, yeah.
[02:00:33.068 --> 02:00:38.449]  But see, the Democrats, I mean, you can see where Bill Clinton left off or George Bush started.
[02:00:38.509 --> 02:00:40.069]  It was seamless.
[02:00:40.590 --> 02:00:42.270]  So, I mean, I would bring up the fact that
[02:00:43.929 --> 02:00:52.498]  So much the Democratic leadership is for invading or attacking Iran, and I would ask him if he's against her, I would ask him, are you going to move to impeach George Bush?
[02:00:52.978 --> 02:01:04.630]  And I think that's a good litmus test to see if he hems and haws, or ask him about the CFR and why he signed non-disclosure agreements to be part of that organization that openly tries to manipulate our political process.
[02:01:04.911 --> 02:01:05.832]  Yeah, okay.
[02:01:06.372 --> 02:01:07.433]  Yeah, you bet.
[02:01:07.453 --> 02:01:08.955]  I really appreciate your call there.
[02:01:09.355 --> 02:01:10.596]  Let's talk to Chad.
[02:01:11.076 --> 02:01:13.899]  Chad is calling us from, what, Missouri?
[02:01:14.740 --> 02:01:15.520]  Hey Alex, how are you?
[02:01:15.801 --> 02:01:16.141]  Good, sir.
[02:01:16.161 --> 02:01:16.742]  What's on your mind?
[02:01:17.582 --> 02:01:23.768]  I just wanted to get your thoughts on something that appeared in the news yesterday in Kansas City.
[02:01:24.614 --> 02:01:29.717]  About the Missouri Department of Transportation using cell phone signals to monitor traffic.
[02:01:30.177 --> 02:01:31.437]  Already going on nationwide.
[02:01:31.457 --> 02:01:36.420]  They track you down just a few feet and now they're excused from Texas to Missouri.
[02:01:37.518 --> 02:01:40.319]  Up to Wyoming just announced it, to California.
[02:01:40.499 --> 02:01:45.221]  Everywhere is either already doing it, we've seen it in documents, or they're already announcing.
[02:01:45.821 --> 02:01:46.562]  Oh, guess what?
[02:01:46.582 --> 02:01:53.344]  We're going to track your cell phone and use that for the traffic warnings on the sides of the street and relay that to the cops.
[02:01:53.725 --> 02:01:58.566]  So that's how they're breaking the ice that, hey, we're tracking and tracing and controlling what you do.
[02:01:59.147 --> 02:02:01.848]  And then, oh, by the way, we're going to give you tickets from point to point.
[02:02:02.388 --> 02:02:04.569]  They'll be able to register your average speed
[02:02:05.369 --> 02:02:08.533]  Using the phone as a transponder off of the cell towers.
[02:02:09.013 --> 02:02:11.095]  Same thing with the inspection sticker tracker chips.
[02:02:11.536 --> 02:02:13.378]  And so they're just breaking the ice with you.
[02:02:13.398 --> 02:02:15.219]  I actually announced that about a month ago in Missouri.
[02:02:15.260 --> 02:02:15.960]  I saw an article.
[02:02:16.641 --> 02:02:18.323]  And yeah, does that make you upset?
[02:02:19.065 --> 02:02:27.572]  Well, I mean, I'm just wondering how easy it's going to be for someone to hack into that database and learn all they need to know about you.
[02:02:27.592 --> 02:02:28.753]  Well, of course, of course.
[02:02:28.773 --> 02:02:34.918]  Most of it is caused by corporations and the government, and then their answer is more government, more control by the same people that did it.
[02:02:34.978 --> 02:02:35.399]  Stay there.
[02:02:35.439 --> 02:02:39.822]  I've got a guest coming on, but I want you to be able to finish your point on the other side of this quick break.
[02:02:39.903 --> 02:02:41.704]  Stay with us at fullwars.com.
[02:02:47.034 --> 02:02:49.896]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[02:02:50.137 --> 02:02:51.738]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[02:02:52.078 --> 02:02:56.742]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[02:02:57.082 --> 02:03:03.828]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[02:03:04.148 --> 02:03:06.128]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has arisen.
[02:03:06.329 --> 02:03:09.169]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[02:03:09.269 --> 02:03:13.930]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[02:03:14.130 --> 02:03:18.551]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[02:03:18.771 --> 02:03:25.993]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds with their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[02:03:26.253 --> 02:03:28.714]  Discover the document of truth for yourself before it's too late.
[02:03:28.834 --> 02:03:30.574]  Call toll-free to get a copy of Martial Law.

[02:03:46.124 --> 02:03:49.405]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[02:03:49.465 --> 02:03:53.627]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[02:03:53.887 --> 02:03:56.689]  But, if you place them on the magnet, all would stick.
[02:03:56.869 --> 02:03:59.270]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[02:03:59.450 --> 02:04:08.113]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[02:04:08.294 --> 02:04:09.654]  The Berkey light is different.
[02:04:09.834 --> 02:04:14.036]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[02:04:14.236 --> 02:04:14.756]  We're good to go!
[02:04:33.348 --> 02:04:34.989]  Screams and stagnant ponds.
[02:04:35.189 --> 02:04:38.391]  Get the Advanced Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:04:38.411 --> 02:04:39.512]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:04:45.822 --> 02:04:47.304]  Hey folks, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:04:47.644 --> 02:04:51.589]  You've all heard me on the radio talking about the importance of investing in precious metals.
[02:04:51.970 --> 02:04:55.494]  I feel it's time for me to talk about the importance of investing in your health.
[02:04:55.875 --> 02:04:59.419]  I was presented with the opportunity to try Tri-Vibes from TriVortex.
[02:04:59.820 --> 02:05:04.686]  I was a bit hesitant of the idea of absorbing vitamins by wearing them rather than ingesting them.
[02:05:05.006 --> 02:05:10.812]  After conducting one of the tests found at TriVortex.com, I was convinced that the product might actually work.
[02:05:11.112 --> 02:05:14.816]  I now wear my TriVibes bands daily, and I'm feeling better than ever.
[02:05:15.176 --> 02:05:17.258]  Not only physically, but also mentally.
[02:05:17.598 --> 02:05:23.364]  TriVortex also offers amazingly beneficial and beautiful jewelry worn by the women around the office daily.
[02:05:23.784 --> 02:05:24.964]  TriVortex is amazing.
[02:05:25.285 --> 02:05:26.385]  Don't take my word for it.
[02:05:26.485 --> 02:05:31.907]  Try TriVortex yourself and have fun and learn with the test found on TriVortex.com.
[02:05:32.107 --> 02:05:35.568]  That's T-R-I-V-O-R-T-E-X dot com.

[02:05:37.189 --> 02:05:37.469]  That's 619-884-1455.
[02:05:50.359 --> 02:05:50.999]  Big Brother.
[02:05:51.659 --> 02:05:52.740]  Mainstream media.
[02:05:53.420 --> 02:05:54.560]  Government cover-ups.
[02:05:55.180 --> 02:05:56.041]  You want answers?
[02:05:56.761 --> 02:05:57.841]  Well, so does he.
[02:05:58.321 --> 02:06:02.182]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:02.503 --> 02:06:06.644]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:06:08.524 --> 02:06:13.206]  In just a few minutes of this live Friday, the 27th day of January, 2006 edition,
[02:06:15.134 --> 02:06:32.722]  Now, eight minutes plus into the third hour, we'll be talking to Katie Heim, member of the Houston Global Awareness Collective, a Houston-based anti-Halliburton group that has been spied on by top-secret Pentagon counterintelligence agency, one of hundreds of groups, pro-gun groups, environmental activist groups, land rights groups, Pentagon.
[02:06:32.762 --> 02:06:40.326]  I mean, again, I've had the Pentagon watch me openly and had them put guns to our heads and take videotapes away from us on city streets in America.
[02:06:41.221 --> 02:06:42.662]  So, I mean, long before 9-11.
[02:06:43.182 --> 02:06:47.884]  I mean, we've known about this for a while, from our own personal experience.
[02:06:47.904 --> 02:06:50.805]  They're creeping around, working with police departments everywhere.
[02:06:51.385 --> 02:06:56.848]  And it's all part of the Soviet-slash-Nazi takeover, incrementally, of this country.
[02:06:56.908 --> 02:06:58.629]  But look how it all dovetails.
[02:06:59.049 --> 02:07:04.311]  The last caller I'm about to go back to, just briefly here, is Chad.
[02:07:04.871 --> 02:07:07.712]  And he's in Missouri, where it's been in the Kansas City Star.
[02:07:07.752 --> 02:07:08.693]  He said last week,
[02:07:09.942 --> 02:07:12.824]  I believe, or this week, I saw it a month ago in the Kansas City Star.
[02:07:12.864 --> 02:07:29.419]  We posted an article on InfoWars.com and on the amply named PrisonPlanet.com where, I mean, every few days we've seen articles, but about a month ago there was one out of Kansas City where they said, yeah, all your cell phones are going to be tracked real-time, just a little computer program business, of course.
[02:07:30.111 --> 02:07:32.893]  Federal Law 96, implemented in 2001 by law.
[02:07:33.994 --> 02:07:37.817]  They're just now telling you about it, but it's to track your car for traffic.
[02:07:37.857 --> 02:07:41.700]  Just like when they put all the millions of cameras up with the Defense Department funds.
[02:07:42.538 --> 02:07:43.900]  Uh, through the Department of Transportation.
[02:07:43.980 --> 02:07:45.501]  It was, quote, to track the cars.
[02:07:46.202 --> 02:07:47.103]  And for your safety.
[02:07:47.123 --> 02:07:53.689]  And of course, TxDOT, say if it's Texas, or the Missouri Department of Transportation, they're all the same.
[02:07:54.169 --> 02:07:59.815]  They're all really federal clones, and the Transportation Department is doing it for traffic.
[02:07:59.915 --> 02:08:01.116]  But, dual use.
[02:08:01.597 --> 02:08:03.178]  It's gonna go on all the squad cars.
[02:08:03.198 --> 02:08:04.560]  Already happening up in Green Bay.
[02:08:04.580 --> 02:08:06.982]  They're trying it with the Governor of Wisconsin.
[02:08:07.921 --> 02:08:12.244]  Well, it was in the Green Bay Paper two years ago, actually three, it's in my film Matrix of Evil.
[02:08:12.825 --> 02:08:29.758]  They're going to have a big command center, and remember three weeks ago I had a Homeland Security head professor teaching a program up in Knoxville with 14 classes, but he's also involved with the military locally, and he said yes, there'll be a big threat board with where your cell phone is and what you're doing, and he admitted it.
[02:08:29.818 --> 02:08:32.180]  See, they're all being told what you're not being told.
[02:08:32.780 --> 02:08:37.345]  So to break the ice, they just say, oh, it's to track you for traffic.
[02:08:39.527 --> 02:08:43.090]  We're just going to use your cell phones, as if their cameras can't do it.
[02:08:43.110 --> 02:08:46.753]  And they also have cameras reading the license plates, and that's instantly uploaded.
[02:08:46.813 --> 02:08:49.296]  And they have transponders doing inspection stickers.
[02:08:49.356 --> 02:08:51.518]  Even if you beat the law in your state, they just still do it.
[02:08:53.283 --> 02:08:59.570]  So then Bush comes out and says, oh, if Bin Laden tries to call America, shouldn't I be able to listen to the call?
[02:08:59.610 --> 02:09:02.374]  Well, he was never barred from doing that.
[02:09:02.674 --> 02:09:04.696]  And these FISA courts, that isn't what was happening.
[02:09:04.716 --> 02:09:06.799]  But they take the best example they've got.
[02:09:06.859 --> 02:09:11.684]  Like, if a terrorist has the nuke strapped to him, he's about to blow up New York.
[02:09:12.525 --> 02:09:13.767]  But he won't tell us
[02:09:14.668 --> 02:09:16.169]  And he's going to detonate it.
[02:09:17.309 --> 02:09:19.050]  Can we torture their five-year-old?
[02:09:19.250 --> 02:09:23.652]  And magically it's on every drama and every show, and magically the White House is using that same script.
[02:09:23.712 --> 02:09:26.273]  Well, I guess we better torture the kid.
[02:09:26.293 --> 02:09:28.053]  Well, it's the same thing with this.
[02:09:28.353 --> 02:09:29.774]  Well, it'll be a lot of calling.
[02:09:29.794 --> 02:09:31.014]  Shouldn't we be able to listen?
[02:09:31.475 --> 02:09:32.595]  Well, of course we should.
[02:09:32.995 --> 02:09:37.317]  And then, voila, everything's tracked and traced for taxation, regulation, and control.
[02:09:39.096 --> 02:09:49.441]  This whole war on terror is focused on you, the people, by an empire that knows now individual indigenous populations are the only threat to total world government.
[02:09:50.002 --> 02:09:51.382]  Now, they openly say this.
[02:09:51.562 --> 02:09:56.845]  This whole war on terror is an inverted power structure attacking you, the individual.
[02:09:57.606 --> 02:09:59.246]  They own the Democrats, they own the Republicans.
[02:09:59.286 --> 02:10:07.230]  I know my guess is holding, and now I've been ranting for three minutes, but they're being spied on by the Pentagon for giving out peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, a very
[02:10:08.792 --> 02:10:15.013]  Milk Toast Group, pun intended, just out pointing out what a wildly corrupt group this is.
[02:10:15.033 --> 02:10:19.574]  I mean, they hire all the illegal aliens in New Orleans and then refuse to even pay them.
[02:10:20.515 --> 02:10:22.095]  They feed rotten food to the troops.
[02:10:22.135 --> 02:10:23.115]  They rip the troops off.
[02:10:23.135 --> 02:10:24.476]  They give them contaminated water.
[02:10:26.216 --> 02:10:28.616]  They've been cited and fined over and over again.
[02:10:29.377 --> 02:10:33.678]  They were in the Chicago Tribune for running white slavery rings.
[02:10:33.818 --> 02:10:35.278]  I mean, they openly have
[02:10:36.027 --> 02:10:41.589]  There's a whole lobbyist just assigned to keeping the Pentagon regulations from not stopping them from slaving.
[02:10:42.810 --> 02:10:47.192]  Yes, slavery is alive and well, and Jesse Jackson isn't going to say a word because he's CFR, folks.
[02:10:47.972 --> 02:10:55.215]  So, so, so, then we have a caller call in right before this guest we're going to in 45 seconds, and bringing up how all the cell phones are tracked.
[02:10:55.676 --> 02:10:56.876]  Of course it's all tracked!
[02:10:56.896 --> 02:10:58.417]  It's tracked in your face!
[02:10:59.651 --> 02:11:03.573]  Real fast, and I appreciate you holding, Chuck, finish up your comments about that.
[02:11:03.593 --> 02:11:06.355]  You know, you're worried, you said, about a hacker hacking in and getting it.
[02:11:06.815 --> 02:11:10.437]  Statistically, the government and the corporations that control it are more criminal than any individual.
[02:11:11.177 --> 02:11:12.918]  Forget some hacker getting it.
[02:11:13.178 --> 02:11:14.719]  What about the crooks in government?
[02:11:14.739 --> 02:11:16.440]  You know, they always say, what do we have to hide?
[02:11:16.660 --> 02:11:17.620]  What do they have to hide?
[02:11:17.680 --> 02:11:18.861]  We shouldn't trust them!
[02:11:18.921 --> 02:11:19.381]  Go ahead.
[02:11:20.562 --> 02:11:26.105]  The issue, I mean, they're not going to be able to sell any of this information that they want to.
[02:11:27.034 --> 02:11:35.591]  And I think even more alarming is the fact that not only will they be able to tell where you're moving from point A to point B, but where you're stopped, anywhere in between.
[02:11:37.561 --> 02:11:48.364]  Sir, it is your literal slave tag, and if you don't have a cell phone, which they're now saying, like 60% of the population does, it'll be in your transponder, and if not in that, in your Michelin tires, or in all your products.
[02:11:48.404 --> 02:11:52.665]  The Pentagon says it is to control the American people.
[02:11:52.705 --> 02:11:55.626]  This is a Pentagon-designed control grid.
[02:11:55.926 --> 02:11:57.447]  They call it a control grid.
[02:11:57.467 --> 02:11:58.127]  Thanks for the call.
[02:11:58.627 --> 02:12:00.269]  And talking about that, and it doesn't scare me.
[02:12:00.309 --> 02:12:02.651]  Some people go, well, okay, it's true, Alex, everything you said.
[02:12:02.891 --> 02:12:03.672]  I better shut up.
[02:12:03.752 --> 02:12:05.154]  No, you better scream bloody murder.
[02:12:05.394 --> 02:12:06.675]  We're not the bad people.
[02:12:06.715 --> 02:12:08.156]  Yeah, what do we have to hide?
[02:12:08.257 --> 02:12:08.677]  Nothing!
[02:12:09.097 --> 02:12:10.238]  We're the good people.
[02:12:10.499 --> 02:12:11.660]  Crooks run the government.
[02:12:12.446 --> 02:12:16.988]  For corporate interests that are not free market, that operate as organized global crime syndicates!
[02:12:17.448 --> 02:12:19.308]  They're international crime families!
[02:12:19.589 --> 02:12:20.629]  They're the Dutch Roll family!
[02:12:20.649 --> 02:12:21.749]  They're the British Roll family!
[02:12:21.909 --> 02:12:23.590]  They're the Rothschilds of the Rockefellers!
[02:12:23.630 --> 02:12:24.971]  They openly own it all!
[02:12:25.371 --> 02:12:28.472]  And they're not free market, and they don't like you and your family!
[02:12:28.692 --> 02:12:33.354]  And they're putting a grid in, so they can abuse the living daylights out of you!
[02:12:33.514 --> 02:12:34.954]  And you better get upset about it!
[02:12:34.974 --> 02:12:36.795]  Alright, I'm gonna shut up.
[02:12:37.575 --> 02:12:40.196]  Pentagon spied on Houston anti-Halliburton activists,
[02:12:40.965 --> 02:12:50.696]  Another member of the group said, it is a truly sad day for our system of government when the Pentagon uses taxpayer funds to protect corporate interests by spying on its citizens engaging in peaceful protest.
[02:12:51.316 --> 02:12:52.918]  Oh, and the government released this information.
[02:12:52.978 --> 02:12:54.319]  They want everybody to know this.
[02:12:55.521 --> 02:12:58.304]  The protest was called, Cook Food Not Books.
[02:12:59.125 --> 02:13:02.788]  And talk about how they ripped people off for food and fed them rotten food.
[02:13:03.028 --> 02:13:04.469]  Admit it!
[02:13:04.549 --> 02:13:09.273]  If you really support this evil war, you should quote support your centurions and want them to be getting good food.
[02:13:09.313 --> 02:13:16.638]  But see, supporting the troops means letting them snuff the DU, letting them get deadly vaccines, letting them eat rotten food.
[02:13:16.898 --> 02:13:18.840]  It means just feeling good and drinking liquor.
[02:13:19.240 --> 02:13:21.782]  And just rolling around with bush stickers all over your car.
[02:13:22.342 --> 02:13:22.942]  Okay, that's enough.
[02:13:22.982 --> 02:13:24.362]  I've gone into a full-bore rant.
[02:13:24.802 --> 02:13:26.723]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[02:13:27.163 --> 02:13:34.484]  We are honored to have Katie Heim on, member of the Houston Global Awareness, HoustonGlobal.org.
[02:13:34.504 --> 02:13:46.426]  And even if you don't agree with their political views, and I think I don't agree with some of them, obviously, with words like collective, you should agree with their First Amendment right to not have a bunch of military commissariat goons following them around.
[02:13:46.966 --> 02:13:49.027]  And the website's HoustonGlobal.org.
[02:13:49.327 --> 02:13:50.727]  Katie, thank you for coming on with us.
[02:13:51.007 --> 02:13:51.787]  Thanks for having me.
[02:13:52.108 --> 02:13:54.208]  Thanks for holding during that last six-minute rant.
[02:13:55.269 --> 02:13:56.169]  I can't help it though.
[02:13:56.209 --> 02:13:57.490]  See, it's all interconnected.
[02:13:57.510 --> 02:14:00.011]  We're being bathed in tyranny right now.
[02:14:00.731 --> 02:14:01.692]  Tell us what happened to you.
[02:14:02.272 --> 02:14:04.413]  Well, I think you're absolutely right about that.
[02:14:04.553 --> 02:14:15.778]  I mean, we heard when investigative reporter Michael Isikoff called and told us that we were on the list of groups that had been monitored because they were a threat.
[02:14:15.978 --> 02:14:17.619]  We were labeled a threat to the government.
[02:14:18.314 --> 02:14:33.179]  And we found out that, you know, of one of the many protests that we've done, for sure, they were looking in on, which was, like you said before, the Cook Food Not Books protest, where we handed out peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, and we had puppets, you know.
[02:14:34.005 --> 02:14:35.206]  We do street theater.
[02:14:35.226 --> 02:14:37.507]  Those are WMDs by the way.
[02:14:37.527 --> 02:14:41.249]  They fire proton beams out of their eyes and are known to hurt children.
[02:14:41.550 --> 02:14:48.454]  Well, they're definitely scary anyway because this is a giant Dick Cheney and we used this giant Dick for many, many protests afterwards.
[02:14:48.494 --> 02:14:52.936]  He became a little bit of a Houston Global Awareness mascot for us.
[02:14:53.076 --> 02:14:57.519]  But this was also the day of the handover, the alleged handover of power.
[02:14:57.919 --> 02:14:59.240]  And part of our point too was that
[02:14:59.625 --> 02:15:05.725]  You know that the power wasn't being handed back to the Iraqi people it was being given to Halliburton in the form of
[02:15:06.178 --> 02:15:09.339]  These contracts, which we all know are completely outrageous.
[02:15:09.399 --> 02:15:14.781]  Well, I mean, they're no-bid contracts, and the media tried to go, oh, well, we shouldn't give the Frenchies contracts.
[02:15:14.801 --> 02:15:16.542]  The foreigners never could get them.
[02:15:16.562 --> 02:15:18.703]  There were no bid for American companies.
[02:15:19.323 --> 02:15:21.604]  Yeah, it's cronyism at its worst.
[02:15:21.684 --> 02:15:23.565]  You know, we've seen how that affects us.
[02:15:23.585 --> 02:15:25.526]  It's criminal war profiteering.
[02:15:25.966 --> 02:15:33.469]  Yeah, and you know, Halliburton is, you know, it's also down in Louisiana, and we saw what cronyism did with the appointment of
[02:15:33.962 --> 02:15:39.547]  Michael Brown there in FEMA and, you know, it's... Hey, he owned a bunch of Arabian rice horses.
[02:15:39.587 --> 02:15:40.428]  He's qualified.
[02:15:41.208 --> 02:15:50.096]  Well, that's what they say, but, you know, for people who tout the market as much as they do, you would think that it would be, you know, a little bit fairer of a process.
[02:15:50.616 --> 02:15:52.878]  So we had this joyful street protest.
[02:15:52.898 --> 02:15:56.621]  There's maybe five or six people at the most were at this protest.
[02:15:56.942 --> 02:15:59.884]  Because this is Houston, sometimes things are big, sometimes they're not.
[02:16:01.627 --> 02:16:11.189]  And, as far as we know, that's the only one, but I would think, you know, we had 300 people in the street at the shareholders' program... They had this ultra-secret army intelligence group spying on you.
[02:16:11.209 --> 02:16:29.833]  You know, if there's really a terror threat, you'd think they'd be spying on some terrorists, but they can't really spy on their CIA bosses, so... Well, you would think that, you know, I think you were absolutely right with the point that you made about them releasing these kinds of information, because they want us to know they're spying on us.
[02:16:29.873 --> 02:16:31.413]  The point of these COINTELPRO programs
[02:16:31.852 --> 02:16:36.355]  are to sow seeds of paranoia and make things divisive.
[02:16:36.375 --> 02:16:38.977]  We know that because it's in their handbooks.
[02:16:39.017 --> 02:16:39.737]  Very astute of you.
[02:16:39.977 --> 02:16:40.498]  You know what I do?
[02:16:40.558 --> 02:16:45.941]  I get video of their faces and I put it on the web and they literally act like vampires confronted with holy water.
[02:16:46.842 --> 02:16:49.483]  Yeah, they're afraid of the truth, you know, and why wouldn't they be?
[02:16:49.523 --> 02:16:51.205]  They've crafted... That's right!
[02:16:51.245 --> 02:16:52.846]  We're going to put you on the internet!
[02:16:52.886 --> 02:16:54.286]  We're going to expose you, traitors!
[02:16:54.587 --> 02:16:56.828]  So you just get ready for it, you Nazi pigs!
[02:16:58.889 --> 02:16:59.450]  There you go.
[02:17:00.896 --> 02:17:01.757]  I mean, I'm serious.
[02:17:01.877 --> 02:17:03.839]  I have nothing to hide.
[02:17:03.879 --> 02:17:05.120]  That's right, you have nothing to hide.
[02:17:05.280 --> 02:17:06.662]  We're going to put you on the internet.
[02:17:07.242 --> 02:17:13.548]  Well, let me tell you, we have criminal intelligence come out, criminal intelligence here in Houston, our HPD division of that.
[02:17:13.908 --> 02:17:15.790]  They come out to almost every one of our protests.
[02:17:15.850 --> 02:17:21.035]  And we're there for all the counter recruitment we did down at the KDR headquarters here in Houston.
[02:17:22.842 --> 02:17:30.969]  You know, these are the same people that protected the Klan when the anti-racist action people tried to protest them in Tombaugh.
[02:17:31.210 --> 02:17:32.070]  No, I know, I know.
[02:17:32.751 --> 02:17:33.772]  It's just unbelievable.
[02:17:33.852 --> 02:17:43.380]  They will protect anybody, and then they're putting plants in the most... Look, up in New York, they have the bike riders, bike riding for bikers' rights, and the CIA is watching them.
[02:17:43.420 --> 02:17:43.901]  Stay with us.
[02:17:46.667 --> 02:17:49.651]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[02:17:50.011 --> 02:17:58.842]  It's portable and requires no water pressure, so you can enjoy healthy drinking water, whether it's during normal times or hostile environments, like a local or national emergency.
[02:17:59.162 --> 02:18:03.848]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[02:18:04.288 --> 02:18:11.017]  The Berkelot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[02:18:11.418 --> 02:18:23.213]  It also removes foul taste and odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:18:23.673 --> 02:18:28.134]  The Berkey Light's rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.
[02:18:28.294 --> 02:18:30.615]  Get the Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[02:18:35.376 --> 02:18:36.436]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:18:51.841 --> 02:18:57.022]  One of America's greatest patriots, Patrick Henry, said, give me liberty or give me death.
[02:18:57.983 --> 02:19:11.186]  It was Patrick Henry who forced the Bill of Rights to be added to the Constitution, your unalienable or unchangeable right to religious freedom, freedom of the press, freedom of speech, or the right to own a gun.
[02:19:12.006 --> 02:19:17.288]  There are certain movements underway to strip you of these unalienable, unchangeable rights today.
[02:19:18.180 --> 02:19:25.442]  To help you grasp the loss of these freedoms, we'll send you absolutely free a one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[02:19:26.222 --> 02:19:26.763]  Just call 1-800-516-8736.
[02:19:26.783 --> 02:19:27.103]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[02:19:27.123 --> 02:19:28.883]  It's absolutely free.
[02:19:29.103 --> 02:19:32.884]  Operators are standing by to assist you.
[02:19:32.904 --> 02:19:33.505]  Just call right now.
[02:19:51.349 --> 02:19:52.570]  Currency devaluation.
[02:19:52.890 --> 02:19:53.450]  Inflation.
[02:19:53.911 --> 02:19:54.631]  One and the same.
[02:19:55.352 --> 02:19:59.335]  If you had deposited $100,000 in a bank at 1% in a 30-month period dating from May 24, 2005, here is what happened to your funds.
[02:20:05.600 --> 02:20:08.722]  The dollar lost 33% of its value in that time frame.
[02:20:08.982 --> 02:20:10.823]  The bank paid you 1%.
[02:20:10.903 --> 02:20:13.904]  Your $100,000 now has a net purchasing power of $68,000.
[02:20:14.445 --> 02:20:16.666]  Here is reality.
[02:20:17.046 --> 02:20:20.628]  The devaluation of currency equals real inflation.
[02:20:21.088 --> 02:20:24.770]  Keep in mind how the value of your paper assets are measured in dollars.
[02:20:25.330 --> 02:20:27.831]  Gold in the same time frame increased 35% in value.
[02:20:29.491 --> 02:20:33.217]  Learn how to protect and profit in this truly unstable world economy.
[02:20:33.578 --> 02:20:34.740]  Call Midas Resources at 1-800-686-2237.
[02:20:34.760 --> 02:20:34.980]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:20:45.504 --> 02:20:52.613]  Is black magic performed daily right in plain view on television, in movies, and in America's leading newspapers and magazines?
[02:20:53.254 --> 02:20:54.035]  I'm Tex Mars.
[02:20:54.456 --> 02:20:57.720]  My newest book, Codex Magicka, is a real eye-opener!
[02:20:57.740 --> 02:20:58.601]  624 pages, over 1,000 photographs!
[02:21:02.766 --> 02:21:11.655]  Codex Magicka shows the world's leading celebrities from movie stars and presidents to bankers and senators caught in the act.
[02:21:12.215 --> 02:21:19.422]  Discover the true secret signs of the Illuminati, their mysterious symbols, their hidden language.
[02:21:20.043 --> 02:21:26.489]  Encyclopedic, documented, Codex Magicka unmasks a conspiracy of immense evil.
[02:21:27.273 --> 02:21:36.385]  Please, order your personal copy of Codex Magicka on the internet at PowerOfProphecy.com or simply phone toll free 1-800-234-9673.
[02:21:36.405 --> 02:21:36.626]  That's 1-800-234-9673.
[02:21:51.820 --> 02:22:05.503]  Your call is coming up in the next segment, and I will get into that Google News, more on torture, more on Iran, and several other issues here, like the talk of impeaching Bush, which again, he's just a little corporate front man.
[02:22:05.523 --> 02:22:09.064]  It's like shark teeth, another roll, just roll forward.
[02:22:09.084 --> 02:22:13.165]  It'll be a big diversion, a big false victory distraction.
[02:22:13.205 --> 02:22:13.685]  But notice,
[02:22:14.548 --> 02:22:17.290]  This entire imperial system is focused on the populations.
[02:22:17.691 --> 02:22:29.260]  The NSA spying is on reporters the White House doesn't like, and members of their own administration, and other members of Congress, and peace groups, or groups that protest Dick Cheney.
[02:22:29.981 --> 02:22:41.791]  It has nothing to do with keeping you safe from the Bin Ladens, who are big shareholders, along with the Bushes and the Queen of England, and companies like the Carlyle Group.
[02:22:43.144 --> 02:22:50.167]  This is all about suppressing the population and creating all these cores of local political police.
[02:22:50.247 --> 02:22:50.948]  Commissariat.
[02:22:51.068 --> 02:22:52.088]  They had that in the Soviet Union.
[02:22:52.348 --> 02:22:53.449]  They had it in Nazi Germany.
[02:22:54.029 --> 02:22:55.329]  These Gestapo people.
[02:22:55.390 --> 02:22:56.270]  I mean, that's what they are.
[02:22:56.997 --> 02:23:01.680]  The most milquetoast groups are being spied on now by these individuals.
[02:23:01.720 --> 02:23:22.212]  Going back to our guest, Katie Heim, a member of the Houston Global Awareness Group, and HoustonGlobal.org is the website, and so there's six of you out there, and now you learn you were being spied on, they were there spying on you, giving out jelly sandwiches, but you've done other stuff like protest against Lord Chaney and others.
[02:23:22.252 --> 02:23:22.772]  Tell us about it.
[02:23:23.377 --> 02:23:30.439]  Yeah, we've done, the last two years running, we have done fairly large protests outside of the Halliburton Annual Shareholders Meetings.
[02:23:31.919 --> 02:23:42.601]  I was also with activist Diane Wilson when she disrupted the Dick Cheney speech here recently when he was in town stumping for funds for Representative Tom DeLay's benefit.
[02:23:42.621 --> 02:23:47.582]  By the way, you were being spied on by the Pentagon long before you went and did that, so it's good that you're not backing off.
[02:23:47.602 --> 02:23:48.943]  You guys are getting more aggressive.
[02:23:49.523 --> 02:23:50.163]  Well, I mean,
[02:23:51.141 --> 02:24:00.630]  It is almost flattering, in a way, to be recognized for the threat to Halliburton's public image that we are.
[02:24:00.650 --> 02:24:09.959]  I mean, Halliburton, on that list, we're the only group who was targeting something that's non-governmental, and it was a corporation.
[02:24:10.399 --> 02:24:14.423]  So it's a threat to the government when you attack a corporation.
[02:24:14.483 --> 02:24:15.224]  That's how Embed
[02:24:15.908 --> 02:24:19.770]  These two divisions of power, there's really no division at all.
[02:24:19.930 --> 02:24:25.613]  Well yeah, the corporations are lobbying the government to give them governmental powers.
[02:24:26.074 --> 02:24:28.995]  And as long as Halliburton keeps stealing money from me and from
[02:24:31.016 --> 02:24:38.981]  From my fellow citizens and continues to treat employees badly, continues to strong-arm our government.
[02:24:39.021 --> 02:24:42.383]  Well it's in the news today how the water supply was full of toxic waste.
[02:24:42.423 --> 02:24:45.525]  Halliburton's own internal people said our people can't drink.
[02:24:45.545 --> 02:24:48.927]  This is their own report and they say shut up let them keep drinking it.
[02:24:49.187 --> 02:24:51.188]  That's right they covered it up and that's...
[02:24:51.668 --> 02:24:53.450]  It's murder in the end, is what that is.
[02:24:53.930 --> 02:24:57.833]  Well, I mean, look, to show the craziness of this crowd, they know DEU is deadly poisonous.
[02:24:58.213 --> 02:25:00.675]  Halliburton's moved into bases that were bombarded with it.
[02:25:00.695 --> 02:25:02.276]  I mean, they don't even care about their own employees.
[02:25:02.977 --> 02:25:05.879]  No, and we've done a lot with employees.
[02:25:06.019 --> 02:25:17.328]  We've spoken to a lot of employees, offered them support, and done anti-recruitment actions at KBR, Halliburton headquarters, so that we can let people know before they jump into
[02:25:18.191 --> 02:25:21.212]  What they don't even realize could be a nightmare.
[02:25:21.292 --> 02:25:23.093]  But I mean, Katie, aren't you a threat?
[02:25:23.353 --> 02:25:28.276]  I mean, let's face it, did Bin Laden tell you to go give those jelly sandwiches to the workers?
[02:25:28.896 --> 02:25:31.157]  I've never spoken to Mr. Bin Laden personally.
[02:25:31.177 --> 02:25:32.678]  But Bush has, but that's okay.
[02:25:33.518 --> 02:25:37.820]  And he signed an order ordering the FBI not to go after him, but just ignore that.
[02:25:40.127 --> 02:25:43.008]  But still, I mean, wasn't this a WMD?
[02:25:43.068 --> 02:25:48.491]  I mean, doesn't a can of peanut butter and jelly sandwiches like attack or like hurt the police or something?
[02:25:48.952 --> 02:25:51.333]  Well, personally, I do believe that food can change the world.
[02:25:51.373 --> 02:25:58.637]  If we spent more money feeding people and less money bombing them, you know, we'd have a much better society overall, don't you think?
[02:25:58.657 --> 02:26:04.560]  I agree, but the head of the UN Food Program said they'd use it as a weapon, and they aren't.
[02:26:04.580 --> 02:26:06.341]  Let me do a little shameless plugging, too.
[02:26:06.361 --> 02:26:06.982]  We're going to
[02:26:07.995 --> 02:26:10.797]  Also have another protest here on May 17th.
[02:26:10.957 --> 02:26:14.639]  The Halliburton shareholders meeting will be held in Houston again.
[02:26:14.679 --> 02:26:18.641]  We're not positively sure, but if people keep checking our website, HoustonGlobal.org,
[02:26:19.514 --> 02:26:22.935]  They'll be able to find that information and we'd love folks from Austin to come down.
[02:26:22.975 --> 02:26:24.455]  Yeah, maybe I'll come down to that and cover it.
[02:26:24.475 --> 02:26:25.775]  If I come down, can I interview you?
[02:26:26.115 --> 02:26:26.656]  Absolutely.
[02:26:27.176 --> 02:26:28.416]  And that's coming up the 17th.
[02:26:28.736 --> 02:26:31.317]  Also, Katie, just where is this going?
[02:26:31.357 --> 02:26:33.237]  I mean, are you guys going to sue?
[02:26:33.277 --> 02:26:37.498]  Because other people are obviously filing lawsuits because they were spied on.
[02:26:37.518 --> 02:26:38.758]  Are you going to join those lawsuits?
[02:26:39.158 --> 02:26:41.399]  Well, we'll be in contact with the ACLU.
[02:26:41.419 --> 02:26:43.299]  We have been in contact with the ACLU.
[02:26:43.679 --> 02:26:47.300]  Scott Parkin, who was the founder of Houston Global Awareness,
[02:26:47.992 --> 02:26:58.399]  Who was also deported by the Australian government for being a threat to their government, which we also think is a result of this spying effort.
[02:27:01.341 --> 02:27:14.970]  Oh, listen, I've got to get you to stand there for three more minutes and talk about Bob on the other side, because for those that don't know, I'm not kidding, you can go read it like in the Age or the Sydney Morning Herald, they are about to pass a law, they've been trying to, Howard has,
[02:27:16.295 --> 02:27:20.378]  Where you get seven years in prison if you criticize the government.
[02:27:20.398 --> 02:27:22.279]  I mean, it clearly states.
[02:27:22.879 --> 02:27:24.580]  Talk about no more free speech, folks.
[02:27:24.980 --> 02:27:27.282]  You just say, I don't like the war.
[02:27:27.782 --> 02:27:29.863]  Seven years in a prison camp.
[02:27:30.844 --> 02:27:33.505]  And believe me, our government would love to get us to that point.
[02:27:36.347 --> 02:27:37.247]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.748 --> 02:27:39.349]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:40.269 --> 02:27:42.931]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.815 --> 02:27:49.157]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here with an important question.
[02:27:49.397 --> 02:27:51.438]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[02:27:51.598 --> 02:27:58.702]  I mean real hard to find all natural pure soap that contains no dyes, perfumes, deodorants, detergents, or other dangerous toxins.
[02:27:58.903 --> 02:28:07.468]  The Calvin Pure Soap Company, for the past 57 years, has been making triple concentrated pure soaps exclusively for healthcare professionals and hospitals.

[02:28:46.474 --> 02:28:48.075]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:28:48.215 --> 02:28:52.317]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[02:28:52.457 --> 02:28:55.339]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[02:28:55.419 --> 02:29:02.102]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[02:29:02.182 --> 02:29:02.282]  Yes.
[02:29:02.302 --> 02:29:05.305]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[02:29:05.526 --> 02:29:07.908]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[02:29:08.028 --> 02:29:18.199]  Black-Murky elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as atrazine, benzene, chloride and chloroform.
[02:29:18.379 --> 02:29:27.522]  MTBE, Radon 222, foul taste and obnoxious odors like sulfur, even nitrates, and unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum are extracted.
[02:29:27.662 --> 02:29:35.425]  Supercharge your gravity filter today and order a 2-pack of Black Berkey Purification Elements for only $96 or a 4-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[02:29:46.445 --> 02:29:53.327]  For months now, you've been hearing about the incredible health benefits of Zango, the functional health beverage made from the whole fruit of mangosteen.
[02:29:53.447 --> 02:30:06.390]  What you probably didn't know is that Zango joined forces with the leading manufacturer and distributor of functional health beverages like Capri Sun, Sobe, Mystic, and Red Bull to create the fastest growing business opportunity in America today.
[02:30:06.570 --> 02:30:08.350]  Are you sick of barely having enough money?
[02:30:08.530 --> 02:30:11.994]  Are you tired of working so hard yet feeling like you'll never get ahead?
[02:30:12.275 --> 02:30:16.059]  Are you ready to start investing in your own business instead of somebody else's?
[02:30:16.320 --> 02:30:21.286]  Whatever it is you seek, Zangle could be the special company that helps you achieve your hopes and dreams.
[02:30:21.546 --> 02:30:23.269]  So take matters into your own hands.
[02:30:23.529 --> 02:30:27.494]  Create a future that doesn't depend on a fickle 401k and lateral promotions.
[02:30:27.754 --> 02:30:29.655]  Dango is what you are looking for.

[02:30:36.177 --> 02:30:36.738]  Call 888-203-6633 today.
[02:30:36.758 --> 02:30:39.639]  The recently retired head of the NSA
[02:30:58.277 --> 02:31:07.365]  Got up on TV, National Press Club on Monday, and we got a clip off the internet, folks.
[02:31:07.405 --> 02:31:09.848]  If you were able to take this off C-SPAN, please send us a copy.
[02:31:10.268 --> 02:31:11.769]  I can just call and buy a copy.
[02:31:12.550 --> 02:31:15.493]  I want to have that crisp and clear for everybody.
[02:31:16.594 --> 02:31:18.636]  But it's up on PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[02:31:19.637 --> 02:31:21.838]  We actually found the clip thanks to a listener who sent it to us.
[02:31:21.858 --> 02:31:25.159]  We just had the editor and publisher article earlier in the week on it.
[02:31:25.580 --> 02:31:29.601]  And he said, oh no, the Fourth Amendment was spying by our government on you.
[02:31:29.701 --> 02:31:32.222]  It just says that it can't be unreasonable.
[02:31:32.262 --> 02:31:34.643]  And we think it's reasonable to listen to everybody.
[02:31:35.804 --> 02:31:37.305]  And to not have a Fourth Amendment, basically.
[02:31:37.365 --> 02:31:42.407]  Well, it says unreasonable search and seizure, then it defines it
[02:31:43.470 --> 02:31:48.973]  That you've got to have a warrant with a person that's sworn to it so you can face your accuser.
[02:31:48.993 --> 02:31:59.698]  See, now they have all these secret informants and then they use that in court and you go to prison and then you find out five years later it was a convicted two-time murderer or cocaine dealer who sent an innocent man to prison.
[02:31:59.718 --> 02:32:00.298]  This is what they do.
[02:32:01.568 --> 02:32:12.695]  And it says, against unreasonable searches and seizures shall not be violated and no warrants shall be issued but upon probable cause supported by oath or affirmation and particularly describing the place to be searched and the persons and things to be seized.
[02:32:12.995 --> 02:32:15.236]  See, we're turning into a spy society.
[02:32:16.437 --> 02:32:20.039]  It's because they've done bad things and they're going to do bad things and abuse all of us.
[02:32:20.079 --> 02:32:26.503]  So I'm going to talk to our guest about that in just a second, but play this clip from MSNBC, from the Overman Show.
[02:32:27.435 --> 02:32:39.183]  My understanding is that the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution specifies that you must have probable cause to be able to do a search that does not violate an American's right against unlawful searches and seizures.
[02:32:57.456 --> 02:33:03.261]  The Fourth Amendment actually protects all of us against unreasonable search and seizure.
[02:33:03.541 --> 02:33:04.442]  That's what it says.
[02:33:04.482 --> 02:33:07.144]  But the measure is probable cause, I believe.
[02:33:07.164 --> 02:33:09.486]  The amendment says unreasonable search and seizure.
[02:33:09.807 --> 02:33:11.288]  But does it not say probable... No.
[02:33:11.348 --> 02:33:14.491]  The amendment says unreasonable search and seizure.
[02:33:14.511 --> 02:33:16.332]  The legal standard is probable cause.
[02:33:16.652 --> 02:33:24.459]  Just to be very clear, okay, and believe me, if there's any amendment to the Constitution that employees of the National Security Agency are familiar with, it's the Fourth.
[02:33:25.223 --> 02:33:25.884]  Right.
[02:33:26.064 --> 02:33:29.167]  And it is a reasonable standard in the Fourth Amendment.
[02:33:30.428 --> 02:33:47.424]  To quote the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States in its entirety, the one the General and the NSA folks are so familiar with and know is about reasonableness and not about probable cause, quote, the right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures
[02:33:48.084 --> 02:33:52.026]  Well, maybe they have a different constitution over there at the NSA.
[02:34:06.155 --> 02:34:11.419]  And notice that the NSA General says, trust me, you know, we really know about this.
[02:34:11.940 --> 02:34:13.221]  And that's what they tell their employees.
[02:34:13.261 --> 02:34:13.721]  I've talked to them.
[02:34:13.741 --> 02:34:15.563]  They go, oh, we're following it.
[02:34:15.583 --> 02:34:16.824]  Fourth Amendment, unreasonable.
[02:34:16.844 --> 02:34:17.884]  It is reasonable.
[02:34:18.705 --> 02:34:20.086]  And then that's the end of it.
[02:34:20.106 --> 02:34:23.549]  They take three words out of a paragraph
[02:34:24.438 --> 02:34:28.659]  And then just nebulous, hang it up in space and then say it says that.
[02:34:29.179 --> 02:34:37.221]  And it's like the Attorney General, when he was Chief Counsel there at the White House, saying the President is the law and we can torture people to death.
[02:34:37.281 --> 02:34:40.962]  And then John Yoo, his deputy, says we can torture little kids!
[02:34:41.302 --> 02:34:42.222]  And they do!
[02:34:42.702 --> 02:34:51.704]  You know, the media always focuses on, you know, well he was a member of Al Qaeda and we beat him to death, or we made him wear women's underwear on his head.
[02:34:51.985 --> 02:34:53.725]  You know, that sounds kind of bad.
[02:34:54.594 --> 02:35:08.108]  But if you read deeper and then we rape children in front of them, I mean, you know, and then, well, we picked up a family at a checkpoint and knocked their teeth out and took one of them for organs and sold the organs and, you know, I mean, that's the kind of stuff that's admitted.
[02:35:08.369 --> 02:35:12.373]  We take them to former Soviet gulags and use cattle prods on them and slave pits.
[02:35:12.693 --> 02:35:15.776]  We hang them by their feet for two days and then they die.
[02:35:16.637 --> 02:35:24.179]  You know, it's hellish, and I know, again, my guest has been holding, I'm gonna let her go in a second, we've got a lot of callers here, but this is just overt evil!
[02:35:24.699 --> 02:35:28.880]  And they just get up there and try to soft-soap it and sell it to us, it's sick!
[02:35:29.541 --> 02:35:31.921]  This whole administration needs to be in federal prison!
[02:35:32.141 --> 02:35:34.262]  And any Democrat that supports them needs to be!
[02:35:34.902 --> 02:35:35.662]  I'm sick of it!
[02:35:36.283 --> 02:35:38.323]  Forget impeachment, I want them all in prison!
[02:35:38.443 --> 02:35:40.244]  And I want their corporate bosses in prison!
[02:35:40.844 --> 02:35:41.464]  I'm sorry, uh...
[02:35:42.208 --> 02:35:45.929]  Katie Heim, I'm just really getting... I'm threatened by this, Katie.
[02:35:45.969 --> 02:35:48.769]  I mean, they're openly saying the President may be a dictator.
[02:35:49.129 --> 02:35:55.171]  Specter's going to have hearings next week with Gonzales, and he's saying, well, they need the President, maybe the law.
[02:35:55.391 --> 02:35:58.491]  They're openly talking about Bush being a dictator now.
[02:35:59.451 --> 02:36:07.633]  Well, you know, it reminds one of Orwell, and, you know, if you have a memory hole big enough, you can create a new reality.
[02:36:08.194 --> 02:36:11.776]  And it seems that that's what this administration is bent on doing.
[02:36:12.117 --> 02:36:13.698]  Exactly!
[02:36:13.778 --> 02:36:16.660]  That is what Karl Rove told the New York Times last year.
[02:36:16.680 --> 02:36:17.000]  Remember?
[02:36:17.060 --> 02:36:18.201]  We control reality.
[02:36:18.981 --> 02:36:27.487]  Yeah, and that's why, I mean, we know for sure that they got the information about this protest that they spied on through Houston Indy Media.
[02:36:28.388 --> 02:36:31.610]  And, you know, we post things there to talk to one another.
[02:36:32.449 --> 02:36:35.731]  It's information and it's arming the people with the real truth.
[02:36:36.171 --> 02:36:37.751]  And that certainly is a threat.
[02:36:38.192 --> 02:36:41.193]  So IndyMedia centers worldwide have been targeted.
[02:36:42.033 --> 02:36:44.154]  And we're going to continue to be a threat.
[02:36:44.174 --> 02:36:45.335]  We're going to continue to be a threat.
[02:36:45.355 --> 02:36:49.577]  Yeah, they do stuff like grab the servers of IndyMedia for no reason.
[02:36:49.617 --> 02:36:49.837]  It's just...
[02:36:51.073 --> 02:36:54.215]  Right, and our site goes down all the time.
[02:36:54.235 --> 02:36:57.157]  I mean, I'm not saying that there aren't, you know, hacks.
[02:36:57.177 --> 02:36:57.738]  Are you kidding?
[02:36:57.778 --> 02:37:02.781]  We've tracked our site with the most sophisticated hacks you can imagine directly back to Fort Meade.
[02:37:03.342 --> 02:37:04.042]  Well, there you go.
[02:37:05.203 --> 02:37:09.866]  That's why we've got five servers and we're adding two more, and every time we're attacked, we just add more.
[02:37:10.687 --> 02:37:14.930]  Well, they try to wear you down when you have limited resources.
[02:37:14.950 --> 02:37:16.291]  We have a rule.
[02:37:16.311 --> 02:37:17.712]  We just redouble our operations.
[02:37:19.068 --> 02:37:20.108]  And that's what we're going to do.
[02:37:20.168 --> 02:37:24.750]  That's what Houston Global Awareness is going to do in light of these revelations.
[02:37:25.070 --> 02:37:26.190]  Yeah, that's got to be our rule.
[02:37:26.650 --> 02:37:29.971]  Intensify the attack on the New World Order every time they pull something.
[02:37:31.191 --> 02:37:31.671]  That's right.
[02:37:32.111 --> 02:37:35.612]  Well, coming up May 17th, you guys are going to be out there.
[02:37:35.852 --> 02:37:36.813]  I think I might come to that.
[02:37:36.833 --> 02:37:39.733]  I'm not sure, but that is very... You know what?
[02:37:39.753 --> 02:37:40.954]  I'll kill two birds with one stone.
[02:37:40.974 --> 02:37:41.714]  I'm making this film.
[02:37:42.503 --> 02:37:48.529]  And I want to show the average idiot on the street who wants to attack other nations, but can't find the country they want to attack on a map.
[02:37:48.809 --> 02:37:54.234]  And I was thinking I'd go to Houston, because that's where you'll find some of the most slaughtering neocon followers on the planet.
[02:37:54.454 --> 02:37:56.696]  And maybe while I'm there, I'll come and interview you guys.
[02:37:56.856 --> 02:37:57.437]  Absolutely.
[02:37:57.537 --> 02:38:08.867]  And right by the Four Seasons, that whole trifecta of evil there, you can find as many idiots as possible on the street that will love to talk to you.
[02:38:09.298 --> 02:38:23.425]  You know, last year they had 35 riot cops on horses, people in full riot gear, which I've never seen in Houston before, and two paddy wagons waiting to take people to jail when we had our protest here.
[02:38:24.006 --> 02:38:28.168]  And 14 people were arrested that day.
[02:38:28.188 --> 02:38:32.410]  We're going to see what happens this year, but I expect it to
[02:38:33.689 --> 02:38:37.159]  And of course they're having quarantine mass roundup drills right now in Houston.
[02:38:37.500 --> 02:38:40.208]  By the way, these are nothing more than federal takeover drills.
[02:38:41.610 --> 02:38:42.431]  Were you aware of those?
[02:38:42.811 --> 02:38:44.052]  No, I wasn't aware of that.
[02:38:44.573 --> 02:38:46.694]  Well, I mean, I'm sure you've heard that you're very informed.
[02:38:46.734 --> 02:38:49.036]  I mean that when I say it, I'm not trying to be patronizing.
[02:38:50.698 --> 02:38:56.843]  But all over the place, I mean, I'm sure you've heard about Bush announcing that he has this imperial power and they're actually setting the stage.
[02:38:56.883 --> 02:39:03.569]  And then he has Tommy Franks on the payroll for 400 grand going around on TV saying martial law is the next step to keep you safe.
[02:39:04.029 --> 02:39:07.232]  Yeah, and we're talking about a contingency of the bird flu.
[02:39:08.373 --> 02:39:09.493]  They're using that as the
[02:39:10.655 --> 02:39:13.677]  As the reason to go forward with the plans.
[02:39:14.257 --> 02:39:14.738]  Exactly.
[02:39:14.918 --> 02:39:19.461]  I mean, I really think we're in danger of actually, I mean, becoming Nazi Germany.
[02:39:19.521 --> 02:39:21.883]  I think we are very close, Katie.
[02:39:21.923 --> 02:39:23.964]  And for people to get scared then and run the other direction.
[02:39:24.124 --> 02:39:26.085]  Folks, our only hope is fighting this at this point.
[02:39:27.326 --> 02:39:33.390]  Well, you know, we're a very manipulatable society because we don't have a political conscience.
[02:39:34.271 --> 02:39:35.832]  And, you know, the American people
[02:39:36.690 --> 02:39:42.135]  All they know to do is consume, and they're consuming whatever the administration puts out right now.
[02:39:43.316 --> 02:39:48.100]  We're like mindless pigeons that will gobble up cyanide-laced grain.
[02:39:49.681 --> 02:39:50.863]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:39:51.943 --> 02:39:55.667]  I wouldn't have said that, but that's a way to get your point across, for sure.
[02:39:55.687 --> 02:40:01.812]  Well, and you've seen how dumb pigeons are, how they scrabble around in a bug-eyed fashion, gobbling whatever you put in front of them.
[02:40:01.872 --> 02:40:02.573]  It's very true.
[02:40:03.696 --> 02:40:17.108]  Well, I tell you, you were talking about your friend over who then got deported because it was picked up and the Australian government was involved and you heard my comment going into break about the seven years for criticizing the government.
[02:40:17.329 --> 02:40:18.730]  I mean, folks, that isn't our opinion.
[02:40:18.950 --> 02:40:19.791]  This is happening.
[02:40:20.972 --> 02:40:28.659]  Yeah, it's a real scary time when the US government can influence another government enough to pick up a citizen who's been given, you know,
[02:40:29.226 --> 02:40:30.007]  We're good to go.
[02:40:43.914 --> 02:40:54.177]  You know, I talk to folks in Australia, and we get the reports, we've even aired TV reports here, where they just calmly on the news go, criticizing the government will get you... is because their newscasters always have an English accent for some reason.
[02:40:54.518 --> 02:40:57.018]  Criticizing the government will get you seven years in prison.
[02:40:57.038 --> 02:40:58.659]  It will keep everyone safe.
[02:40:58.719 --> 02:41:00.299]  I mean, that's not freedom!
[02:41:00.359 --> 02:41:01.640]  Seven years for talking?
[02:41:05.367 --> 02:41:09.292]  Yeah, it's amazing and the government uses the line freedom.
[02:41:09.392 --> 02:41:14.539]  Freedom and the word liberty have been distorted to the point where people don't even understand what they mean anymore.
[02:41:14.599 --> 02:41:14.960]  It's just...
[02:41:15.481 --> 02:41:16.942]  Like hamsters at the pedal.
[02:41:17.042 --> 02:41:17.963]  Oh, freedom, freedom.
[02:41:17.983 --> 02:41:18.964]  Yeah, we like freedom.
[02:41:18.984 --> 02:41:20.666]  You know, they use that word again.
[02:41:20.686 --> 02:41:21.586]  Well, it's funny you say that.
[02:41:21.626 --> 02:41:26.291]  I have a lady in London when I was over there covering the bombings on video and the film I mentioned that I'm making.
[02:41:26.891 --> 02:41:31.896]  And I say to her, I say, should we give up our liberty for security?
[02:41:31.916 --> 02:41:33.277]  Because I said we don't get security.
[02:41:33.817 --> 02:41:36.760]  And she says, oh, I think we should give up our liberty for freedom.
[02:41:37.440 --> 02:41:38.882]  When liberty and freedom are the same thing.
[02:41:40.143 --> 02:41:41.204]  I don't even know what that means.
[02:41:43.132 --> 02:41:50.454]  Well, I don't think people realize how abusive governments have been throughout history and that we're seeing the exact same thing happen, Katie.
[02:41:51.234 --> 02:41:54.375]  Well, the only protection against it is ourselves.
[02:41:55.115 --> 02:42:04.218]  The more of us that get out into the streets and onto the airwaves and put pen to paper and speak truth to power, it's going to take that.
[02:42:04.318 --> 02:42:09.479]  If we don't exercise our right to do what Thomas Jefferson said and take back our government,
[02:42:10.126 --> 02:42:13.567]  It's not going to be out of our hands, and it may already be.
[02:42:13.747 --> 02:42:14.288]  No, you're right.
[02:42:14.328 --> 02:42:23.831]  We get the government we deserve, and we've just really had it too good for too long, and just think that it can't happen here, and it's going to happen here in the worst way.
[02:42:23.871 --> 02:42:29.173]  But in closing, and again, the website, if folks want to visit it, it's HoustonGlobal.org.
[02:42:29.193 --> 02:42:30.974]  There's links to it up on InfoWars.com.
[02:42:32.003 --> 02:42:33.063]  The good thing is this, Katie.
[02:42:33.904 --> 02:42:37.445]  I've been doing this for almost 12 years, but 10 years ago, everybody laughed at me.
[02:42:37.505 --> 02:42:39.065]  Five years ago, half the people did.
[02:42:39.385 --> 02:42:41.006]  Three years ago, 10% did.
[02:42:41.066 --> 02:42:49.268]  Now, I liken it to selling a life preserver to somebody who's fallen into the ocean or snow cones in hell.
[02:42:49.788 --> 02:42:52.769]  Now, all these stations, liberal, conservative, even
[02:42:55.171 --> 02:42:59.664]  The stations that all over the country who were carrying stuff like Air America are putting me on.
[02:42:59.684 --> 02:43:01.149]  By the way, I'm pro-Second Amendment.
[02:43:03.532 --> 02:43:10.914]  It seems like stuff getting so radical has even made a radical like Alex Jones now begin to become mainstream.
[02:43:10.954 --> 02:43:16.055]  I mean, are you seeing that more and more people, when you talk to them now, really are tuned in and know what's happening?
[02:43:16.495 --> 02:43:18.636]  Oh, I think that's a trend across the United States.
[02:43:18.696 --> 02:43:24.758]  I mean, you look at, you've got Christians marching across Cuba to hold a hunger strike outside of Guantanamo Bay.
[02:43:25.178 --> 02:43:26.358]  You've got, you know, people getting
[02:43:26.958 --> 02:43:27.759]  Getting arrested.
[02:43:27.999 --> 02:43:29.360]  And I'm talking about everyday people.
[02:43:29.400 --> 02:43:34.964]  We're not talking about what we, you know, closely associate with that stereotypical protester.
[02:43:34.984 --> 02:43:36.545]  Professional protester, yeah.
[02:43:36.565 --> 02:43:36.845]  Right.
[02:43:36.865 --> 02:43:38.907]  These are regular, everyday people with kids.
[02:43:39.067 --> 02:43:39.908]  I have two kids.
[02:43:40.188 --> 02:43:47.573]  You know, what I'm doing is trying to show them that it's better to fight on your feet than die on your knees.
[02:43:47.693 --> 02:43:51.436]  I'm not going to submit myself to an external power.
[02:43:52.068 --> 02:43:54.189]  Like the government that's going to quash me.
[02:43:54.249 --> 02:43:55.809]  It's not going to happen.
[02:43:55.889 --> 02:43:58.790]  Oh, you're a great woman and a great American and a great human being.
[02:43:59.330 --> 02:44:00.671]  Katie, you know what?
[02:44:00.711 --> 02:44:02.051]  I've pretty much made my mind up.
[02:44:02.712 --> 02:44:04.072]  May is a way off, though.
[02:44:04.852 --> 02:44:10.374]  But I'll definitely see you down there and I look forward to covering the demonstration and getting folks to come out there to it.
[02:44:10.654 --> 02:44:11.715]  Alright, well let's keep in touch.
[02:44:12.055 --> 02:44:12.575]  Okay, bye bye.
[02:44:12.595 --> 02:44:12.715]  Thanks.
[02:44:13.455 --> 02:44:14.796]  All right, I know the caller's been holding.
[02:44:14.816 --> 02:44:17.519]  Let's go through them quickly, because I really love hearing from you.
[02:44:17.559 --> 02:44:21.442]  And then I've got to hit some of this Google stuff and some of these other things with Iran.
[02:44:21.542 --> 02:44:26.786]  It's just... Folks, this is not a radical broadcast.
[02:44:26.826 --> 02:44:30.229]  I'm sorry it sounds scary, but they really are tracking you with your cell phone.
[02:44:30.249 --> 02:44:32.011]  They really are trying to do all this.
[02:44:32.051 --> 02:44:33.532]  They really do kidnap kids.
[02:44:33.612 --> 02:44:35.393]  I mean, Halliburton really does do it.
[02:44:35.433 --> 02:44:36.835]  It's in the Chicago Tribune.
[02:44:37.575 --> 02:44:41.999]  Imagine having to say it, though, years before it was in the news and getting threatened.
[02:44:42.854 --> 02:44:44.615]  I don't care though, man, they're evil!
[02:44:44.916 --> 02:44:46.257]  They kidnap little kids!
[02:44:46.317 --> 02:44:48.398]  I mean, we gotta fight these people!
[02:44:48.838 --> 02:44:49.699]  It's a no-brainer!
[02:44:51.360 --> 02:44:53.402]  And so many of you aren't evil that are in government.
[02:44:53.722 --> 02:44:54.803]  You're not overtly evil.
[02:44:54.823 --> 02:44:55.823]  You're not consciously evil.
[02:44:56.023 --> 02:45:01.807]  But you rationalize, and, oh, that ain't true, oh, that guy's a... Listen, grow up, man.
[02:45:02.108 --> 02:45:03.529]  This stuff is real, okay?
[02:45:03.569 --> 02:45:04.049]  Believe me.
[02:45:04.229 --> 02:45:04.990]  This is what I do.
[02:45:05.070 --> 02:45:05.690]  I study this.
[02:45:05.850 --> 02:45:06.951]  And it freaks me out.
[02:45:07.151 --> 02:45:09.633]  And it makes me really angry that you're not upset about it.
[02:45:09.913 --> 02:45:12.536]  It makes me really angry, because, I mean, let me tell you something.
[02:45:12.696 --> 02:45:14.197]  The New World Order doesn't care about you.
[02:45:14.217 --> 02:45:19.162]  They see you like a cucumber, or like a cabbage, or like a... lower than a cockroach.
[02:45:19.182 --> 02:45:21.724]  I mean, they see you as a commodity, a human resource.
[02:45:21.884 --> 02:45:25.347]  They talk about you and call you bugs, and idiots, and slaves.
[02:45:25.568 --> 02:45:27.630]  They publish books calling you slaves.
[02:45:27.850 --> 02:45:34.356]  Brzezinski published a book, one of the top globalist strategists, calling you stupid slaves.
[02:45:35.197 --> 02:45:35.517]  Hello Alex.
[02:45:35.537 --> 02:45:36.418]  I want to mention a couple things.
[02:45:57.415 --> 02:46:08.260]  It would be a good idea to get a couple guests on, or one or the other, Eric John Thaltz and Bill Eberhardt, to discuss the Roman Catholic Church's involvement in this New World Order.
[02:46:08.480 --> 02:46:09.661]  You called about a month ago.
[02:46:09.681 --> 02:46:10.321]  Yeah, I did.
[02:46:10.341 --> 02:46:17.385]  And I've waited for a response from you, and I haven't heard anything from your brother, and every time somebody mentions that,
[02:46:18.396 --> 02:46:22.403]  You know, you talk as if we're talking about every Catholic in the world, and we're not.
[02:46:22.643 --> 02:46:23.585]  Well, I'm not a Catholic.
[02:46:23.645 --> 02:46:25.047]  Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[02:46:25.167 --> 02:46:26.349]  I'm not a Catholic, number one.
[02:46:26.790 --> 02:46:28.773]  Number two, sir, we don't screen the calls.
[02:46:28.813 --> 02:46:29.394]  What's your first name?
[02:46:29.414 --> 02:46:30.176]  Where are you calling from?
[02:46:30.876 --> 02:46:32.877]  I mean, if you want to disagree, you go to the front of the line.
[02:46:32.917 --> 02:46:37.400]  In fact, if you'd have told them you disagree with me, you'd have gone to the front of the line and wouldn't have been on hold for 45 minutes.
[02:46:37.760 --> 02:46:38.821]  I'll tell you this right now.
[02:46:38.841 --> 02:46:40.142]  I'll tell you that I am not in the business
[02:46:50.775 --> 02:46:53.537]  of bashing particular denominations and groups.
[02:46:54.017 --> 02:47:00.141]  I will come right out and say Israel irradiated 110,000 of their own kids, and there's an evil government over there.
[02:47:00.442 --> 02:47:05.705]  And then I can show my... I'll say that the Catholic Church is calling for a one world government, and that's wrong and bad.
[02:47:05.965 --> 02:47:09.328]  Pat Robertson is absolutely out of control, but that doesn't mean all Protestants are bad.
[02:47:09.608 --> 02:47:11.909]  Now how is that that I'm disagreeing with you?
[02:47:12.310 --> 02:47:17.073]  Well, in 1940, between 600,000 and 1 million Croatians were murdered
[02:47:18.147 --> 02:47:22.851]  At the direction and control of Roman Catholic priests in the Ustashe, in Serbia.
[02:47:23.311 --> 02:47:26.493]  That happened, and not one word of it's been in the history books.
[02:47:26.533 --> 02:47:29.435]  Well, actually, that has... One of the founding churches murdered millions of people.
[02:47:29.475 --> 02:47:36.040]  Sir, it's been in the history books that there were, in occupied territories, a lot of Catholics who collaborated with the Nazis.
[02:47:36.080 --> 02:47:37.121]  I mean, those are Catholic countries.
[02:47:38.382 --> 02:47:42.705]  What about Vichy France?
[02:47:43.025 --> 02:47:44.266]  We mean it's not in the history books.
[02:47:44.666 --> 02:47:47.729]  You must not have read history books if you're saying there's not one word.
[02:47:56.315 --> 02:47:56.996]  We're good to go.
[02:48:13.610 --> 02:48:17.873]  Reinhard Galen came to the United States to help him set up the CIA.
[02:48:18.094 --> 02:48:19.234]  Well, listen, I appreciate your call.
[02:48:19.735 --> 02:48:25.779]  If you're saying that powerful organizations and groups do bad, corrupt things, man, you got the right show.
[02:48:25.899 --> 02:48:26.500]  I agree with you.
[02:48:27.180 --> 02:48:29.142]  I don't know what you're even disagreeing with.
[02:48:29.702 --> 02:48:33.545]  Now, I'm not going to froth and do a show five days a week about Catholics.
[02:48:34.246 --> 02:48:36.087]  I mean, that's just, you got the wrong show.
[02:48:38.453 --> 02:48:41.574]  You know, I don't think there's... that one of these groups is in control.
[02:48:42.074 --> 02:48:45.495]  There are evil people in control of all these groups.
[02:48:46.035 --> 02:48:52.856]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1 The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[02:48:53.176 --> 02:48:54.557]  That's right folks, DVD.
[02:48:54.737 --> 02:48:56.957]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[02:48:57.097 --> 02:48:59.178]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[02:48:59.458 --> 02:49:04.399]  If you want to wake up your friends and families to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[02:49:04.719 --> 02:49:08.200]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United
[02:49:09.021 --> 02:49:10.802]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[02:49:10.862 --> 02:49:21.530]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and portable microchips, and much, much more.
[02:49:21.670 --> 02:49:23.572]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[02:49:23.792 --> 02:49:27.655]  Order your copy on VHS or TV today, and man the guns in the Info War.
[02:49:27.735 --> 02:49:29.156]  Order right now by calling 1-888-2533139.
[02:49:29.216 --> 02:49:29.396]  That's 888-2533139.

[02:49:45.666 --> 02:49:50.890]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[02:49:51.030 --> 02:49:59.116]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[02:49:59.376 --> 02:50:06.421]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[02:50:06.601 --> 02:50:07.882]  Radioactive Poisoning.
[02:50:07.962 --> 02:50:13.866]  Potassium Iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[02:50:14.046 --> 02:50:19.130]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[02:50:19.250 --> 02:50:28.136]  Potassium Iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[02:50:28.396 --> 02:50:32.999]  Order the official Potassium Iodate for only $24 and save $5 by calling New Millennium at

[02:51:47.359 --> 02:51:52.501]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:51:53.161 --> 02:51:55.562]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:51:56.262 --> 02:52:05.165]  Look, I don't care if it's a Catholic or a Jewish person or a Protestant or a Buddhist running Halliburton, you know, involving the white slavery rings.
[02:52:05.245 --> 02:52:06.945]  I mean, it's in the Chicago Tribune.
[02:52:06.985 --> 02:52:07.545]  It's admitted.
[02:52:07.845 --> 02:52:08.846]  Nobody's getting in trouble.
[02:52:08.866 --> 02:52:09.786]  Let him get in trouble.
[02:52:10.484 --> 02:52:15.168]  It's just so many of these shows and hosts, they just constantly perseverate on one group.
[02:52:16.229 --> 02:52:17.910]  I'm for everybody fighting the New World Order.
[02:52:18.390 --> 02:52:19.431]  And I don't use labels.
[02:52:19.491 --> 02:52:21.373]  I just say, let's all come together and defeat the New World Order.
[02:52:21.593 --> 02:52:22.914]  And that's how we're going to do it, folks.
[02:52:22.934 --> 02:52:23.835]  We've got a big ten here.
[02:52:23.855 --> 02:52:25.916]  I don't care what color you are, what group.
[02:52:26.117 --> 02:52:27.678]  I've got my views, you've got your views.
[02:52:27.798 --> 02:52:28.819]  I'm going to push my views.
[02:52:29.139 --> 02:52:33.763]  But I'm not going to sit there and say that you're the ultimate evil and that you're taking over and you've got to be dealt with.
[02:52:34.023 --> 02:52:36.205]  By the way, folks, I have made 14 films.
[02:52:36.225 --> 02:52:37.826]  The 14th film, Order of Death, is out.
[02:52:38.186 --> 02:52:42.571]  Exposing this satanic death cult that is in control of all these major groups.
[02:52:42.891 --> 02:52:46.275]  And when you get it, you get Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove free on the same DVD.
[02:52:46.475 --> 02:52:49.839]  Just go to Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.tv to find out more.
[02:52:49.879 --> 02:52:51.861]  And there's toll-free numbers and addresses there on the site.
[02:52:52.121 --> 02:52:54.264]  There's your 30-second plug for the full three hours.
[02:52:55.445 --> 02:52:55.665]  U.S.
[02:52:55.705 --> 02:52:58.088]  Congressman takes Google to task on China!
[02:52:58.743 --> 02:53:11.228]  Chris Smith, who I want to try to get on, a Republican congressman, is saying that he accuses Google of collaborating with persecutors, no kidding, who imprison and torture Chinese citizens in the service of truth.
[02:53:11.928 --> 02:53:19.271]  And that's true, and now Google, along with Yahoo and every other major group, Fox News made the deal, what, eight years ago.
[02:53:20.094 --> 02:53:21.415]  By the way, you're on MySpace.
[02:53:21.735 --> 02:53:22.556]  38 million users.
[02:53:22.636 --> 02:53:23.456]  Fox owns that.
[02:53:23.777 --> 02:53:24.637]  No criticism.
[02:53:24.817 --> 02:53:26.058]  It's already like China here.
[02:53:26.539 --> 02:53:29.361]  They're doing it here, and all these people defend them.
[02:53:29.381 --> 02:53:31.762]  Well, I'm a MySpace user, so it's all right.
[02:53:31.782 --> 02:53:33.143]  I don't care.
[02:53:33.163 --> 02:53:37.266]  I won't say anything bad about Michael Rupert.
[02:53:37.286 --> 02:53:48.654]  I mean, whoever the name is of the... I'm having a... Was it a Freudian slip, or was it a... The head guy there at Rupert.
[02:53:49.261 --> 02:53:50.101]  Rupert Murdoch!
[02:53:50.181 --> 02:53:50.841]  There we go!
[02:53:50.981 --> 02:53:53.262]  I said Mike Rupert, a fine fellow.
[02:53:53.302 --> 02:53:59.183]  Got him mixed up with Mr. uh... uh... the owner of uh... Fox.
[02:53:59.403 --> 02:54:00.023]  Well, I'm out of control.
[02:54:00.043 --> 02:54:00.603]  This is what happens.
[02:54:00.623 --> 02:54:03.964]  I get to the end of the show and I've got about ten articles here I wanted to mention.
[02:54:04.464 --> 02:54:05.804]  And I've got loaded phone lines.
[02:54:05.844 --> 02:54:08.605]  Hartwell, Paula, James, all these other people that are holding.
[02:54:08.985 --> 02:54:10.345]  And then I just start blithering.
[02:54:10.405 --> 02:54:10.985]  So you know what?
[02:54:11.366 --> 02:54:12.146]  Sorry to the callers.
[02:54:12.166 --> 02:54:13.246]  I don't have time to go to you.
[02:54:13.586 --> 02:54:14.646]  I have to cover this news.
[02:54:14.686 --> 02:54:15.366]  Call me back tomorrow.
[02:54:15.446 --> 02:54:16.026]  I apologize.
[02:54:16.407 --> 02:54:17.747]  So I'm going to try to settle down now.
[02:54:17.827 --> 02:54:18.247]  Take a breath.
[02:54:21.481 --> 02:54:31.515]  And I commend Chris Smith, but we'll find out if he puts on a whitewash when he has a commission hearing on this subject and ends up basically whitewashing it.
[02:54:31.535 --> 02:54:36.902]  Because so often they'll go, we're going to look at executive power, and then they look at it and go, we decided that dictatorship was allowable.
[02:54:39.418 --> 02:54:50.222]  Another one here, Google the sensitive terms in China, and again, they're doing it, and just thousands and thousands of things are going to be blocked out.
[02:54:50.242 --> 02:54:55.143]  And again, InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, a lot of this stuff here in the U.S.
[02:54:55.204 --> 02:55:00.185]  is blocked out by the servers themselves, libraries, colleges, businesses.
[02:55:01.426 --> 02:55:03.226]  We are infiltrating software and blocked.
[02:55:03.646 --> 02:55:06.087]  Go to a computer that's not blocked and go to our websites.
[02:55:06.127 --> 02:55:08.108]  It's mainly mainstream news and legislation.
[02:55:08.897 --> 02:55:15.599]  It's just we post everything or almost everything that we talk about on the website so we can, when we make a claim, we can prove it.
[02:55:15.859 --> 02:55:17.959]  When we tell you that there's a section in the U.S.
[02:55:17.999 --> 02:55:18.859]  Code that says the U.S.
[02:55:18.899 --> 02:55:20.920]  government can kill millions of U.S.
[02:55:20.940 --> 02:55:23.401]  citizens for no reason, if it wants to, we give the section.
[02:55:23.481 --> 02:55:23.701]  U.S.
[02:55:23.721 --> 02:55:29.762]  Code, Title 50, Chapter 32, Subsection 1528, Paragraph B. I don't care what laws they put in.
[02:55:30.042 --> 02:55:31.703]  I don't have to follow that.
[02:55:31.743 --> 02:55:35.283]  Lawmakers say they will press Bush on spying, A.P.
[02:55:35.763 --> 02:55:37.764]  And if you believe that, I've got a bridge I want to sell you.
[02:55:39.017 --> 02:55:45.100]  And Joe Lieberman, U.S., prepared for Iran strike.
[02:55:45.841 --> 02:55:47.922]  Senator Joe Lieberman said Sunday that the U.S.
[02:55:48.002 --> 02:55:58.207]  is prepared to deal with the Iranian nuclear crisis military, even if the war in Iraq continues to require a substantial American troop withdrawal.
[02:56:00.106 --> 02:56:05.531]  And it goes on to say, we have the most powerful military in the history of the world, Lieberman told CBS, face the nation.
[02:56:05.751 --> 02:56:10.695]  We are capable, if necessary, of continuing to pursue our aims militarily in Iraq and Afghanistan.
[02:56:11.035 --> 02:56:13.017]  Mr. dual citizenship, Lieberman said.
[02:56:14.878 --> 02:56:16.800]  Mr. foreign government agent, Lieberman said.
[02:56:17.601 --> 02:56:18.461]  We're out of time.
[02:56:18.481 --> 02:56:23.365]  Thank you to all the affiliates, the sponsors, you, the listeners, the great folks running the show, my producer, everybody.
[02:56:23.425 --> 02:56:25.007]  Take care, InfoWars.com.
