[00:00:05.473 --> 00:00:06.113]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.773 --> 00:00:07.834]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.554 --> 00:00:09.695]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.315 --> 00:00:11.155]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.875 --> 00:00:12.776]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.796 --> 00:00:17.358]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.618 --> 00:00:21.760]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:24.321 --> 00:00:31.884]  Growing up, I would expect to see a headline like this one in a place...
[00:00:32.848 --> 00:00:35.270]  Like Russia, U.S.
[00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:46.860]  war prisons become legal vacuum for 14,000 prisoners captured on battlefields, pulled from beds, grabbed off streets.
[00:00:48.141 --> 00:00:52.505]  And this is from AOL News, a reprint of an AP article.
[00:00:55.245 --> 00:01:01.246]  14,000.
[00:00:55.825 --> 00:01:01.246]  You know, I had reported tens of thousands from expert sources we have, but we didn't know it was 14.
[00:01:01.486 --> 00:01:06.067]  We knew it was more than 10, but we thought a little bit over 10.
[00:01:06.707 --> 00:01:08.147]  Now Bush comes out and says 14.
[00:01:08.468 --> 00:01:10.688]  That probably means it's 35.
[00:01:10.768 --> 00:01:12.208]  I mean, these people are such liars.
[00:01:12.268 --> 00:01:14.909]  It's usually three or four times worse than what they say.
[00:01:15.669 --> 00:01:18.249]  But to be serious, 14, I mean, that is huge.
[00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:21.350]  And quite a few of them are U.S.
[00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:21.850]  citizens.
[00:01:22.583 --> 00:01:24.304]  Thank you for joining us today.
[00:01:24.324 --> 00:01:26.104]  I am really honored that you've joined us.
[00:01:26.164 --> 00:01:28.205]  It is the 18th day of September, 2006.
[00:01:29.365 --> 00:01:34.606]  And when I say we're going to have open phones, we really are going to have open phones today.
[00:01:34.626 --> 00:01:36.847]  I'm going to take a lot of your calls throughout three hours.
[00:01:37.407 --> 00:01:38.567]  And I don't like whining about it.
[00:01:38.587 --> 00:01:39.768]  I don't like talking about it.
[00:01:39.788 --> 00:01:41.588]  I don't want you to call in and tell me to get well.
[00:01:41.648 --> 00:01:42.328]  I appreciate it.
[00:01:42.348 --> 00:01:46.310]  I just want you to know I've been a little bit dingy and why I sound different.
[00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:51.111]  I have allergies, but I don't ever really get sick.
[00:01:53.757 --> 00:01:58.240]  Last time I got sick, I looked it up, it was about three and a half years ago, and I got the flu really bad.
[00:01:59.801 --> 00:02:01.742]  Fringe benefit if I lost about 12 pounds.
[00:02:02.763 --> 00:02:10.227]  I couldn't go to bed for three days and finally had to be shipped over to the clinic to be given an injection to hold down fluids because I got dehydrated.
[00:02:11.088 --> 00:02:15.491]  Whatever I caught this time, I haven't gone to the doctor, is worse than what I got three and a half years ago.
[00:02:16.713 --> 00:02:23.578]  I've never had something hit my stomach, my lungs, and my head, and I got it in that mecca that is New York.
[00:02:24.439 --> 00:02:29.462]  Rob Jacobson, of course, was sick as we left Tuesday, New York, was shivering in the airport.
[00:02:29.482 --> 00:02:33.225]  I had to get in my bag and pull out my clothes for him because he didn't have any long-sleeved stuff.
[00:02:34.466 --> 00:02:39.169]  And then I started getting sick on Wednesday, but kind of ignored it and denied it and refused it.
[00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:43.913]  And then by Thursday night, during the last showing of Terror Storm, I literally was stumbling around.
[00:02:44.696 --> 00:02:45.216]  I'm still sick.
[00:02:45.236 --> 00:02:45.576]  This is some...
[00:03:16.954 --> 00:03:19.935]  This is some really tough stuff, to say the least.
[00:03:22.016 --> 00:03:24.757]  Hell, I got like a half a degree of temperature right now.
[00:03:24.837 --> 00:03:29.439]  I just cannot believe that four days later, I'm still sick.
[00:03:29.979 --> 00:03:33.620]  I know, I'm going to get the calls, colloidal silver, this, that.
[00:03:34.601 --> 00:03:37.642]  I'm not big into medicine, but yeah, I think I am going to try to go.
[00:03:37.662 --> 00:03:41.824]  I've got one of those little generators somewhere around the house.
[00:03:41.844 --> 00:03:45.085]  I ought to go dig that out and get on it, because this is just...
[00:03:46.016 --> 00:03:48.517]  What on earth are these megacities breathing?
[00:03:48.557 --> 00:03:53.480]  What type of weirdo germs do they have that make you feel this bad this long?
[00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.821]  Alright, I'm done talking about it.
[00:03:56.962 --> 00:04:01.004]  But please don't call me with your cures or your best wishes.
[00:04:01.024 --> 00:04:10.689]  I just wanted to let you know I sound more like a 97-year-old cigar-smoking man than normal.
[00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:13.130]  Because I normally sound like that anyways.
[00:04:14.291 --> 00:04:17.692]  But that's not why you tuned in here, and I apologize.
[00:04:17.752 --> 00:04:23.575]  I'm just literally still in a fog here, though I feel myself, with God's good graces, climbing out of this pit.
[00:04:24.795 --> 00:04:25.155]  U.S.
[00:04:25.235 --> 00:04:29.057]  war prisons become legal vacuum for $14,000.
[00:04:29.537 --> 00:04:34.399]  Now, I want to go over this a little bit when we get back from break.
[00:04:35.359 --> 00:04:42.322]  Then there's a new show they put on the National Geographic Channel, Triple Cross.
[00:04:44.142 --> 00:04:48.946]  Where they go, oh, look how the top Al-Qaeda person was an army captain.
[00:04:49.947 --> 00:04:51.949]  He was really a triple agent of Al-Qaeda.
[00:04:51.989 --> 00:04:54.071]  Yeah, and I'm a triple agent of the Easter Bunny.
[00:04:55.492 --> 00:04:57.313]  There's a bunch of other news on the economy.
[00:04:57.373 --> 00:04:58.494]  There's a ton of news.
[00:04:58.534 --> 00:05:00.696]  Stay with us.
[00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:07.362]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[00:05:07.921 --> 00:05:09.862]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[00:05:10.222 --> 00:05:17.886]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:05:18.566 --> 00:05:25.610]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:34.454]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spy, secret police torture,
[00:05:34.775 --> 00:05:37.436]  The latest 9-11 information and much, much more.
[00:05:37.736 --> 00:05:41.258]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:05:41.718 --> 00:05:43.619]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:05:43.959 --> 00:05:47.881]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:06:04.611 --> 00:06:07.473]  Where are military bases and hazardous waste sites located?

[00:06:57.402 --> 00:07:03.905]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network.
[00:07:04.025 --> 00:07:06.386]  I have an urgent message for all of our listeners.
[00:07:06.446 --> 00:07:13.530]  The mass media keeps telling us that we are the richest, most powerful economy in the world, quote-unquote.
[00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:16.392]  If this is true, why can't we pay our bills?
[00:07:17.072 --> 00:07:20.534]  Why is the United States the world's largest debtor nation?
[00:07:21.135 --> 00:07:25.276]  The truth is, is that we are in the worst debt bubble in our nation's history.
[00:07:25.856 --> 00:07:28.837]  When the bubble bursts, will you be able to feed your family?
[00:07:29.817 --> 00:07:32.718]  When the inevitable crash occurs, will you be ready?
[00:07:33.458 --> 00:07:35.919]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.
[00:07:35.959 --> 00:07:36.499]  That's 1-888-892-6238.
[00:07:36.539 --> 00:07:39.500]  For the following two free reports, U.S.
[00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:41.801]  Debt Bubble, Red Alert, and Real Estate Crash.
[00:07:51.317 --> 00:07:59.225]  Call 888-8-XANADU, that's 888-8-X-A-N-A-D-U, and ask for George.
[00:08:02.369 --> 00:08:08.395]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:09.016 --> 00:08:11.979]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:22.775 --> 00:08:23.855]  Okay, my friends.
[00:08:23.875 --> 00:08:25.916]  I am here.
[00:08:25.936 --> 00:08:29.218]  I am back in the saddle again.
[00:08:29.598 --> 00:08:32.639]  Honored to be your host.
[00:08:32.659 --> 00:08:41.724]  I'm very blessed to be here and have the capacity to fight the New World Order and to be speaking out against the Global Crime Syndicate.
[00:08:43.225 --> 00:08:48.147]  And there is a lot of news and information that we're going to be covering today.
[00:08:49.512 --> 00:08:51.093]  Of the greatest import.
[00:08:52.093 --> 00:09:12.384]  But the first big issue is, and I know for our listeners you're probably sick of hearing about it, but we're having victories right now, and the battle has now been joined on the subject of secret prisons, secret torture, renditions, snatch and grabs, the whole nine yards, and so now we do need to yet again talk about it.
[00:09:14.625 --> 00:09:16.566]  Because the general public has been...
[00:09:18.809 --> 00:09:19.529]  We're good to go.
[00:09:43.186 --> 00:09:49.012]  We get rough with these people, and we pressure them, and we interrogate them, but we don't torture them.
[00:09:50.933 --> 00:09:55.958]  And they put out a few neocon-funded polls that still showed narrow majorities agreeing with it.
[00:09:56.999 --> 00:10:01.103]  Real polls show the respective polling agencies show the vast majority against it.
[00:10:02.845 --> 00:10:04.006]  The Bush polls go like this.
[00:10:05.104 --> 00:10:16.532]  If interrogating someone roughly will foil an imminent al-Qaeda attack that will kill thousands or millions, are you for President Bush having the power to protect you?
[00:10:16.552 --> 00:10:18.894]  I mean, that's basically a paraphrase I've read the polls.
[00:10:19.454 --> 00:10:20.735]  I've seen the questions they're giving.
[00:10:21.395 --> 00:10:25.158]  They also call key demographic areas where they know they're mindless.
[00:10:26.519 --> 00:10:28.200]  You can't even call them conservatives.
[00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:32.163]  It's just kind of mainstream people who...
[00:10:33.715 --> 00:10:43.061]  I think they're part of the elite and play golf three days a week and just basically, again, George Bush could slit their children's throats in front of them and they'd thank him for it.
[00:10:43.101 --> 00:10:45.082]  Or maybe they'd ask Bush for a bib.
[00:10:45.102 --> 00:10:48.965]  They'd probably ask Bush to be invited to the barbecue to eat their own children.
[00:10:50.486 --> 00:10:54.548]  That's the types they call up who say that they think this is a good idea.
[00:10:54.568 --> 00:10:55.809]  But U.S.
[00:10:55.869 --> 00:10:56.149]  War...
[00:10:59.904 --> 00:11:10.788]  Prisons become legal vacuum for 14,000 prisoners captured on battlefields, pulled from beds, grabbed off streets.
[00:11:12.268 --> 00:11:13.449]  And this is from the AP.
[00:11:14.129 --> 00:11:15.549]  I got it off AOL News.
[00:11:15.990 --> 00:11:25.173]  In the first few short years since the first shackled Afghan shuffled off to Guantanamo, the U.S.
[00:11:25.213 --> 00:11:28.634]  military has created a global network of overseas prisons
[00:11:30.134 --> 00:11:36.817]  It's islands of high security keeping 14,000 detainees beyond the reach of established law.
[00:11:37.537 --> 00:11:45.600]  Disclosures of torture and long-term arbitrary detentions have won rebuke from leading voices, including the U.N.
[00:11:45.700 --> 00:11:47.781]  Secretary General and the U.S.
[00:11:47.821 --> 00:11:48.581]  Supreme Court.
[00:11:49.222 --> 00:11:56.445]  But the bitterest words came from inside the system the size of the several major U.S.
[00:11:56.525 --> 00:11:57.305]  penitentiaries.
[00:11:58.687 --> 00:12:01.448]  It was hard to believe I'd get out.
[00:12:01.588 --> 00:12:14.772]  Baghdad shopkeeper Amjad Qasim Al-Awani told the Associated Press after his release, without charge, last month, I lived with the Americans for one year and eight months as if I was living in hell.
[00:12:15.352 --> 00:12:16.793]  And then they go through what happened to him.
[00:12:17.793 --> 00:12:28.096]  Now, we contrast the reality of these torture camps in Jordan, Egypt, Iraq, Cuba, secret prisons in the U.S., Canada,
[00:12:28.965 --> 00:12:38.591]  Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan, former areas of the Eastern Bloc, and it is now admitted.
[00:12:40.312 --> 00:12:49.737]  I remember old-timers, when I was first waking up 15 years ago, saying, and they will ship us to former Soviet gulags.
[00:12:50.398 --> 00:12:52.579]  These were former military men, colonels and people.
[00:12:53.286 --> 00:12:54.266]  They will ship us.
[00:12:54.346 --> 00:12:55.527]  I've seen the documents.
[00:12:56.087 --> 00:13:01.008]  They have plans to ship us to former Soviet gulags, and there they will torture us.
[00:13:01.368 --> 00:13:11.031]  They're going to fly us out of the new federal transfer center that they're building, now built many years ago, in Oklahoma City and out of Denver.
[00:13:11.071 --> 00:13:13.192]  And I was just like, come on.
[00:13:13.892 --> 00:13:15.032]  Come on.
[00:13:16.012 --> 00:13:16.833]  And it was all true.
[00:13:18.193 --> 00:13:18.993]  You're like, wait a minute.
[00:13:19.013 --> 00:13:19.953]  Bush did this after 9-11.
[00:13:20.094 --> 00:13:20.814]  Uh-uh.
[00:13:20.974 --> 00:13:21.614]  Bill Clinton...
[00:13:22.455 --> 00:13:25.256]  Gave speeches about Homeland Security in 1993.
[00:13:26.977 --> 00:13:31.739]  And if you don't know that the whole thing with the Soviets, all of it, folks, it's all staged, okay?
[00:13:33.479 --> 00:13:36.861]  Russia, the U.S., China, they're all teamed up against the people.
[00:13:37.481 --> 00:13:39.482]  Teamed up against the Chinese, the Americans.
[00:13:40.342 --> 00:13:41.982]  It's just all a staged event.
[00:13:42.863 --> 00:13:46.904]  There are a few lone wolves out there that you might be able to say aren't under control.
[00:13:47.465 --> 00:13:48.885]  Ahmed Dinejad, maybe.
[00:13:49.305 --> 00:13:49.765]  I doubt it.
[00:13:50.926 --> 00:13:51.006]  Uh...
[00:13:52.051 --> 00:13:54.514]  I'll tell you who probably is good is Hugo Chavez.
[00:13:57.877 --> 00:14:01.341]  That's why the elite's in control, folks, because they know how to make backroom deals.
[00:14:01.421 --> 00:14:02.302]  Okay, they're a mafia.
[00:14:05.185 --> 00:14:13.574]  And so I remember all these old-timers who sounded credible and had some documents claiming all this, but I was just like, yeah, they're going to ship us to foreign countries.
[00:14:14.014 --> 00:14:14.695]  Sure they are.
[00:14:15.470 --> 00:14:18.531]  Many of you probably heard me 12 years ago poo-pooing it on air.
[00:14:18.571 --> 00:14:19.611]  Well, I apologize.
[00:14:19.711 --> 00:14:20.432]  Okay, I'm wrong.
[00:14:20.812 --> 00:14:22.472]  In fact, some people say I exaggerate.
[00:14:22.492 --> 00:14:23.053]  No, no, no, no.
[00:14:23.513 --> 00:14:28.174]  Most of the time when I'm wrong, it's worse than what I said.
[00:14:29.355 --> 00:14:29.715]  All right?
[00:14:30.475 --> 00:14:31.836]  Much worse than what I've said.
[00:14:32.136 --> 00:14:32.876]  I didn't know it was 14,000.
[00:14:33.656 --> 00:14:41.799]  And if Bush is telling us 14,000, it's probably double that in my experience with these people.
[00:14:42.679 --> 00:14:44.860]  And there are a lot of American citizens who are disappearing.
[00:14:45.839 --> 00:14:53.261]  And there are a lot of top neocons on national TV and radio and in newspapers calling for people, American citizens, to be disappeared.
[00:14:54.261 --> 00:14:57.142]  I have had national talk show hosts call for my disappearance.
[00:14:58.482 --> 00:15:04.784]  I've had people walk up to me when I'm at line at a movie theater or when I'm walking down the street and say, I deserve to go to a camp.
[00:15:04.824 --> 00:15:06.364]  You've heard a few of them call into the radio.
[00:15:08.605 --> 00:15:13.626]  And make no mistake, these people that wrap themselves in desecrated American flags made by Chinese slaves
[00:15:14.298 --> 00:15:16.299]  You know the types with the flags all over their cars.
[00:15:16.339 --> 00:15:18.941]  They don't know what three amendments to the Bill of Rights are.
[00:15:19.481 --> 00:15:21.062]  They'll man concentration camps.
[00:15:21.082 --> 00:15:23.643]  They'll shove cradle prods down your throats, folks, okay?
[00:15:23.963 --> 00:15:24.984]  These people are scum.
[00:15:28.686 --> 00:15:29.787]  So we're in a lot of danger.
[00:15:29.887 --> 00:15:30.767]  I'm in a lot of danger.
[00:15:31.968 --> 00:15:33.349]  And I don't say that for effect.
[00:15:33.409 --> 00:15:33.769]  I mean it.
[00:15:33.829 --> 00:15:37.731]  I mean, the worst Nazis were just well-meaning, low-grade morons.
[00:15:39.312 --> 00:15:41.433]  They weren't, at the base level, bad people.
[00:15:41.473 --> 00:15:42.914]  They were just so stupid...
[00:15:43.641 --> 00:15:49.524]  They thought patriotism was butchering the Weimar Republic's Bill of Rights, which they had.
[00:15:51.285 --> 00:15:57.308]  And today, you've got zombies who, if Hillary Clinton gets in, that they believe patriotism is doing whatever Hillary Clinton says.
[00:15:57.729 --> 00:16:00.550]  You've got zombies who think patriotism is doing whatever George Bush says.
[00:16:00.870 --> 00:16:01.771]  And they're in denial.
[00:16:01.791 --> 00:16:03.652]  You know, I had a guy call into the show yesterday.
[00:16:03.672 --> 00:16:05.653]  I know I talk about this every day.
[00:16:05.673 --> 00:16:06.513]  I'm going to talk about it again.
[00:16:06.533 --> 00:16:07.554]  Because nothing's more important.
[00:16:08.605 --> 00:16:11.026]  By the way, I'm going to write a new article with Paul Watson.
[00:16:11.046 --> 00:16:12.787]  I'm trying to get a hold of that whippersnapper.
[00:16:12.807 --> 00:16:13.687]  He's not answering his phone.
[00:16:13.707 --> 00:16:16.688]  I'm going to skin him.
[00:16:16.748 --> 00:16:21.070]  But we need to do a big report on all the torture.
[00:16:21.730 --> 00:16:28.273]  One that's just got bullet points in it, because this guy calls into KLBJ, the show we're syndicating through Genesis.
[00:16:29.253 --> 00:16:30.814]  Oh, let me cover this now.
[00:16:31.914 --> 00:16:36.916]  You know, there are so many people out there that do everything they can to hurt the GCN radio network.
[00:16:37.754 --> 00:16:45.079]  And then any time I try to slap them back down, they then squeal and say, let's be friendly, let's be buddies, let's be whatever.
[00:16:45.139 --> 00:16:58.187]  And it's just whatever plan they can come up with to undermine this network and try to hurt us and try to pull their little weasel activities, this rumor has been spread.
[00:16:58.527 --> 00:17:00.908]  It's not the normal rumor that I'm dead or had a heart attack.
[00:17:00.948 --> 00:17:01.849]  No, no, not that one.
[00:17:03.250 --> 00:17:04.731]  That comes in every week or so.
[00:17:05.776 --> 00:17:12.300]  No, the rumor is that I am leaving Genesis to go be syndicated on MS Communications.
[00:17:12.460 --> 00:17:13.421]  No, no, let me explain.
[00:17:13.961 --> 00:17:25.127]  And I had explained on there, and the people that make these rumors up don't care, and responding to these rumors don't work, because the people putting out the rumors know it's a lie, and they're doing it just to try to hurt this network.
[00:17:26.088 --> 00:17:33.472]  I announced that I'm doing a show with MS Communications, and I announced that they offered me a weekday show, and I said no to it.
[00:17:34.421 --> 00:17:37.202]  And then I told them, let's do a weekend show and let's syndicate it.
[00:17:37.222 --> 00:17:38.062]  And they said, great.
[00:17:38.603 --> 00:17:40.083]  And it's going to be on Genesis stations.
[00:17:40.143 --> 00:17:41.264]  It's going to be on MS stations.
[00:17:41.324 --> 00:17:42.104]  It's going to be huge.
[00:17:42.124 --> 00:17:43.585]  3 to 6 p.m.
[00:17:43.605 --> 00:17:45.525]  Right now it's 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:17:45.545 --> 00:17:46.446]  It's about to be expanded.
[00:17:48.046 --> 00:17:55.629]  And it's going to be syndicated through MS on Genesis satellites, on GCN radio satellites together.
[00:17:57.950 --> 00:18:02.252]  And so rumors of Genesis' demise have been greatly exaggerated yet again.
[00:18:02.990 --> 00:18:06.513]  And the very same people that do it made some hay out of it a few years ago.
[00:18:07.373 --> 00:18:08.454]  Conned a bunch of people.
[00:18:10.035 --> 00:18:16.940]  And the very same people that got scammed by it are ready to be scammed twice, thrice, it doesn't matter.
[00:18:18.061 --> 00:18:20.602]  And I just frankly really get tired of it.
[00:18:22.704 --> 00:18:28.688]  The very same individual spreading those rumors was leaving mean phone calls on my cell phone last week, and I just...
[00:18:29.702 --> 00:18:32.763]  I just, there's never really going to be an end to it.
[00:18:32.823 --> 00:18:34.303]  And I just don't understand it.
[00:18:34.403 --> 00:18:39.505]  Every time I try to have good, amiable feelings towards people, it doesn't matter.
[00:18:39.865 --> 00:18:42.106]  And that individual gets rewarded for their activities.
[00:18:42.406 --> 00:18:46.807]  So I guess that's, you know, what, just the way the ball bounces.
[00:18:49.408 --> 00:18:50.708]  Okay, I've now digressed.
[00:18:50.728 --> 00:18:52.849]  Anyways, I'm doing the KLBJ show yesterday.
[00:18:53.829 --> 00:18:56.110]  Literally drug my hind end in there.
[00:18:57.331 --> 00:18:58.851]  Basically hanging on the microphone.
[00:19:00.809 --> 00:19:12.715]  And I... This guy calls in and he says, Are you telling me the White House says they can rape children?
[00:19:13.755 --> 00:19:15.676]  I'm looking it up and I can't find it.
[00:19:15.756 --> 00:19:16.717]  I just don't believe it.
[00:19:17.797 --> 00:19:20.639]  And frankly, sir, I don't want to believe it either, okay?
[00:19:21.299 --> 00:19:22.760]  It's normal not to be able to believe that.
[00:19:24.380 --> 00:19:25.781]  Every time I say it, my soul...
[00:19:28.493 --> 00:19:30.914]  Says to me, it can't be true, it can't be real.
[00:19:31.674 --> 00:19:39.937]  You know, it'd be like saying George Bush unzipped his suit and he was really a 14-foot possum.
[00:19:41.098 --> 00:19:42.798]  I mean, you don't want to believe it.
[00:19:43.999 --> 00:19:45.620]  But it doesn't matter.
[00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:47.180]  You know, I said I'd take your calls.
[00:19:50.181 --> 00:19:51.802]  And we're going to take your calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:19:51.842 --> 00:19:54.243]  I can't even do justice to this torture thing.
[00:19:57.845 --> 00:19:59.486]  It's just unbelievable.
[00:20:01.846 --> 00:20:05.427]  Do you know where the 78 potentially active volcanoes in the U.S.
[00:20:05.447 --> 00:20:05.968]  are located?
[00:20:06.168 --> 00:20:09.549]  And do you know the locations of the top 300 prime terrorist targets?

[00:21:13.186 --> 00:21:14.206]  The dollars ranged from $9,800 to $10,300, a 5% increase.
[00:21:14.246 --> 00:21:18.568]  The dollar's value has dropped from $0.96 to $0.70 against the euro, a 24% decrease in spending power against the gold-backed euro.
[00:21:18.588 --> 00:21:21.530]  Gold has gone from the $390s to the $440s, a 16% increase in real money,
[00:21:37.352 --> 00:21:40.374]  Precious metals are the safe haven in today's hectic marketplace.

[00:22:06.966 --> 00:22:13.451]  Did you know that the United Nations' basic philosophy is both anti-American and pro-dictatorship?
[00:22:13.511 --> 00:22:22.818]  Did you know that the United Nations was founded by communist and Marxist members of the Council on Foreign Relations whose goal is a socialistic one-world government?
[00:22:24.252 --> 00:22:24.693]  We're good to go.
[00:22:24.713 --> 00:22:24.853]  I think?

[00:24:19.827 --> 00:24:20.887]  We're here for now.
[00:24:20.907 --> 00:24:24.948]  And then we're gone, my friends.
[00:24:26.949 --> 00:24:27.589]  Welcome back.
[00:24:28.549 --> 00:24:30.730]  Alright, you know what?
[00:24:31.070 --> 00:24:34.711]  I'm just going to hold off on the news because I'm tired of making people wait an hour to go to your calls.
[00:24:35.231 --> 00:24:43.233]  We'll go to calls right now and then there's just... Literally, I've got like four or five days of news here I've been wanting to cover.
[00:24:43.874 --> 00:24:45.454]  It's all of the highest importance.
[00:24:46.266 --> 00:24:50.188]  The way the Washington Post spins the CIA control of our election system.
[00:24:50.689 --> 00:24:51.669]  I want to go over that.
[00:24:51.689 --> 00:24:54.451]  I want to talk about this spinach.
[00:24:55.712 --> 00:24:59.494]  But right now, let's go to Ed in Florida, then Brian, John, Andrew, Skip, and others.
[00:25:00.034 --> 00:25:00.755]  Ed, you're on the air.
[00:25:01.315 --> 00:25:02.176]  Hey, Alex.
[00:25:03.857 --> 00:25:05.398]  Okay, I'll just jump right in here.
[00:25:06.658 --> 00:25:10.881]  I really appreciate the link that you had to the 9-11 Mysteries demolitions video.
[00:25:11.919 --> 00:25:13.180]  I thought it was a great video.
[00:25:13.420 --> 00:25:16.301]  It's a great film, and we're going to be carrying it here.
[00:25:16.781 --> 00:25:19.682]  The DVDs are en route to this office in the next day or two.
[00:25:19.762 --> 00:25:21.242]  One of the first places you should be able to get them.
[00:25:21.682 --> 00:25:29.265]  We are going to have the new 9-11 Mysteries Part 1 excellent film, Demolitions, available in DVD.
[00:25:29.665 --> 00:25:30.345]  Yeah, it's great.
[00:25:30.965 --> 00:25:33.666]  I like the fact that it didn't really mention the Illuminati.
[00:25:33.686 --> 00:25:35.266]  It didn't really mention who's at fault.
[00:25:35.326 --> 00:25:37.047]  It just provided some factual information.
[00:25:37.549 --> 00:25:46.281]  It's perfect for those people that are kind of sitting on the fence and really don't know about the Illuminati and all these sort of other conspiracies that you and I know about.
[00:25:46.301 --> 00:25:47.643]  No, I agree.
[00:25:47.683 --> 00:25:52.630]  I think it's important to have some type of treatise or work that is for the beginners.
[00:25:53.130 --> 00:25:55.073]  That's one of my biggest problems is I forget.
[00:25:55.826 --> 00:26:07.911]  That, you know, so many of our listeners or people that are tuning into our information have never even been given the basics of it, so we're kind of bringing them into, you know, let's say a mid-level or higher level.
[00:26:09.231 --> 00:26:12.353]  We're not that complex, but, yeah, I mean, it's kind of confusing.
[00:26:13.113 --> 00:26:20.276]  You know, and also, I'm in Florida, Palm Beach County, and the woman, well, all the anthrax stuff went on here.
[00:26:21.261 --> 00:26:28.204]  And right now there was an article in the paper on September 13th saying that the anthrax victim's widow says the government may know who killed her husband.
[00:26:28.904 --> 00:26:31.605]  And it was a pretty interesting article.
[00:26:31.625 --> 00:26:32.665]  I didn't see that.
[00:26:32.685 --> 00:26:33.386]  Email me that.
[00:26:33.406 --> 00:26:34.066]  I'll get her on.
[00:26:34.286 --> 00:26:34.946]  Tell me your name.
[00:26:35.166 --> 00:26:36.407]  Tell me the headline.
[00:26:36.427 --> 00:26:41.689]  The headline is, Anthrax Victim's Widow Says Government May Know Who Killed Husband.
[00:26:42.149 --> 00:26:45.250]  Just go to palmbeachpost.com and type that in.
[00:26:45.870 --> 00:26:47.051]  And it was on September the 13th.
[00:26:48.146 --> 00:26:53.569]  So if any of your listeners want to also flood their editorial board, that would be great.
[00:26:53.609 --> 00:26:57.150]  I wrote a pretty lengthy article, but who knows if they'll actually publish it.
[00:26:57.490 --> 00:27:05.494]  Their editor, Randy Schultz, he doesn't want to hear anything about the 9-11 conspiracy or anything like that.
[00:27:05.534 --> 00:27:07.275]  He believes JFK acted.
[00:27:08.526 --> 00:27:09.607]  Oswald acted alone.
[00:27:09.627 --> 00:27:13.250]  Yeah, he's the 8% that says the 92% of us are crazy.
[00:27:13.550 --> 00:27:19.655]  Yeah, he was depressed and dismayed that so many people believe the theory about 9-11.
[00:27:19.695 --> 00:27:28.922]  Yeah, I guess he's depressed that we know about Tuskegee and depressed we know about sterilization and depressed we know about the radiation of children and depressed we know that DU is bad.
[00:27:29.082 --> 00:27:31.964]  Because if we'll just say DU is good, suddenly it won't kill us.
[00:27:32.324 --> 00:27:32.504]  Right.
[00:27:32.624 --> 00:27:34.665]  Suddenly it'll make it good for our tummies.
[00:27:35.005 --> 00:27:43.549]  You know, maybe they should just call E. coli a conspiracy, and then we can just start eating big bowls of E. coli, and it won't hurt us anymore.
[00:27:43.569 --> 00:27:44.609]  Well, that sounds good.
[00:27:44.629 --> 00:27:46.010]  It tastes good, too, E. coli.
[00:27:46.030 --> 00:27:47.230]  Well, it's like mercury.
[00:27:47.250 --> 00:27:50.132]  Remember, we have CBS now saying it's good for you.
[00:27:51.352 --> 00:27:52.794]  So, I'm serious.
[00:27:53.354 --> 00:27:57.518]  Listen, media, controlled media, you can't sell us your bull anymore, okay?
[00:27:57.718 --> 00:27:58.398]  Yeah, we're on to you.
[00:27:58.859 --> 00:27:59.419]  Exactly.
[00:27:59.559 --> 00:28:03.603]  And just the beginning of the awakening is happening right now.
[00:28:04.244 --> 00:28:05.845]  Good to hear from you, and I appreciate your call.
[00:28:06.726 --> 00:28:07.266]  Good caller.
[00:28:07.887 --> 00:28:10.129]  Yeah, I'll try to remember that and go look that up.
[00:28:11.090 --> 00:28:12.751]  Brian in California, go ahead.
[00:28:12.771 --> 00:28:13.992]  Hi, Alex.
[00:28:14.312 --> 00:28:14.573]  Hey.
[00:28:14.593 --> 00:28:16.214]  First of all, I wanted to say that...
[00:28:17.957 --> 00:28:18.457]  I'm with you.
[00:28:18.477 --> 00:28:24.340]  I've been studying the Illuminati and New World Order's agenda for, well, since early 2001.
[00:28:24.781 --> 00:28:32.464]  And also, I've watched Loose Change and Terror Storm on Google.
[00:28:32.584 --> 00:28:37.267]  I've ordered the DVD so I can try to help people up by making copies.
[00:28:37.827 --> 00:28:45.731]  And, well, my question is, have you ever looked into the possibility that the United States of America could be identified as
[00:28:52.454 --> 00:28:54.035]  You know, I'm not a pastor.
[00:28:55.496 --> 00:28:59.498]  But I've had esteemed pastors on to give their views on that issue.
[00:29:00.819 --> 00:29:02.880]  But let me just put it to you this way.
[00:29:02.900 --> 00:29:05.842]  I don't hide my faith under a bushel.
[00:29:06.143 --> 00:29:07.423]  I'm proud of my faith.
[00:29:08.104 --> 00:29:14.348]  At the same time, I separate it only in that there's an endless esoteric discussion about
[00:29:15.083 --> 00:29:15.684]  We're good to go.
[00:29:40.197 --> 00:29:43.440]  When this is all vaporized, not one stone on top of another, look out.
[00:29:43.520 --> 00:29:44.641]  So I believe Jesus.
[00:29:45.461 --> 00:29:47.062]  A lot of these preachers, they don't.
[00:29:47.743 --> 00:29:49.684]  They'll say I'm a devil because I believe Jesus.
[00:29:51.326 --> 00:29:52.226]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.727 --> 00:29:54.328]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.249 --> 00:29:57.931]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.348 --> 00:30:01.928]  We're good to go.
[00:30:01.948 --> 00:30:02.148]  I think?
[00:30:31.184 --> 00:30:40.830]  Visit us online at ResearchedHerbs.com to learn more about heart care, the widely researched natural herbal supplement for regulating blood pressure and maintaining optimum heart health.
[00:30:41.151 --> 00:30:47.235]  Did you know that the safety and effectiveness of heart care is backed by over 100 clinical trials and experimental studies?
[00:30:47.635 --> 00:30:48.075]  Act now.
[00:30:48.195 --> 00:30:54.259]  Visit us online at ResearchedHerbs.com or call us at 1-800-845-3841 to start protecting yourself from the silent killer.

[00:31:01.533 --> 00:31:01.993]  Thank you.
[00:31:23.331 --> 00:31:29.812]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[00:31:30.012 --> 00:31:35.093]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[00:31:35.213 --> 00:31:44.095]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[00:31:44.355 --> 00:31:47.656]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5.

[00:31:51.797 --> 00:31:52.037]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:32:02.586 --> 00:32:05.148]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here with an important question.
[00:32:05.308 --> 00:32:07.470]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[00:32:07.750 --> 00:32:17.858]  I mean the hard to find kind that's all natural and not full of corrosive toxins and chemicals and detergents that just dry out your skin and have been connected to very serious health problems?
[00:32:18.158 --> 00:32:20.480]  Let me tell you something about the Cal Bend Pure Soap Company.

[00:33:10.355 --> 00:33:12.997]  Oh, I apologize to Andrew in Australia.
[00:33:13.118 --> 00:33:18.722]  Normally an international call, especially that far afield on your own dime.
[00:33:36.867 --> 00:33:41.268]  I will go to you first, but I just missed you there in the queue with all the names.
[00:33:41.749 --> 00:33:49.631]  So, Andrew, when we go to calls here in a few minutes, you'll be first, and John, Skip, Jason, Bill, and many, many others that are patiently holding.
[00:33:49.651 --> 00:33:53.372]  I want to give you some new information on electronic voting machine frauds.
[00:33:53.392 --> 00:34:00.614]  I want to give you my take on the spinach and tell you about something a lot more dangerous than this E. coli-laced spinach.
[00:34:01.755 --> 00:34:04.595]  We will also get into a bunch of new, exciting 9-11 news.
[00:34:07.202 --> 00:34:08.223]  We're good to go.
[00:34:39.326 --> 00:34:51.509]  But I do want to spend some more time after calls on the torture issue, just the amazing bravado of the administration trying to spin that, A, saying it's not torture, and then B, saying they're above the law and can do it.
[00:34:52.849 --> 00:35:08.913]  And the fact that it's blowing up in their face, it's being rejected by the Senate, because the military doesn't like it, the Congress doesn't like it, the Constitution says they can't do it, the Bill of Rights says they can't do it, all jurisprudence, all precedent says they can't, and Bush still gets up there and acts like it's no big deal.
[00:35:10.089 --> 00:35:11.470]  And I'll tell you why they're doing this torture.
[00:35:11.510 --> 00:35:14.091]  We've got JAG officers on here, retired JAG officers, and they agree.
[00:35:14.571 --> 00:35:15.791]  It's to get fake intelligence.
[00:35:16.292 --> 00:35:26.036]  They're torturing people, in some cases to death, to claim they were Al-Qaeda and to claim they were going to do this and that, so the real terrorists can then come in here and take our freedoms.
[00:35:27.256 --> 00:35:38.341]  I meant to get him on last Friday, but I did not do the broadcast Friday due to illness, but I am now here live, and we are honored that he did join us today.
[00:35:39.321 --> 00:35:41.262]  And I really can't say enough about Marty.
[00:35:42.884 --> 00:35:44.225]  It is a third generation.
[00:35:44.265 --> 00:35:45.205]  His father started it.
[00:35:45.265 --> 00:35:46.826]  Now he and his son are on it.
[00:35:46.866 --> 00:35:49.088]  Coming up in a few months will be their 60th anniversary.
[00:35:49.108 --> 00:35:54.352]  They've been around since 1947, if you can believe that.
[00:35:54.392 --> 00:35:54.892]  It's amazing.
[00:35:54.912 --> 00:35:57.074]  They were organic before he even called it organic.
[00:35:57.114 --> 00:36:02.678]  It's made out of all vegetable and, of course, citrus oils and vegetables.
[00:36:03.286 --> 00:36:03.766]  Vitamins.
[00:36:04.326 --> 00:36:05.267]  And it's what I use.
[00:36:05.447 --> 00:36:09.368]  My mother, I gave her some, and she's like, my gosh, this stuff is incredible.
[00:36:10.628 --> 00:36:12.889]  It's a joke around the office how much people like it.
[00:36:14.209 --> 00:36:16.750]  And I really am not hyping it.
[00:36:17.510 --> 00:36:21.611]  And you save 85% off supermarket costs because that's the incredible thing.
[00:36:22.951 --> 00:36:24.012]  You save money.
[00:36:24.032 --> 00:36:29.493]  You save money when you filter your water with high-quality water filters instead of just buying questionable bottled water.
[00:36:30.214 --> 00:36:31.874]  And taps nuts to drink.
[00:36:32.335 --> 00:36:33.915]  But still, people want to buy bottled water.
[00:36:34.415 --> 00:36:43.617]  You save money buying high-quality, made-in-America organic soap for dishwashing, for clothes washing, for hair washing, for your face, everything.
[00:36:43.977 --> 00:36:46.878]  But you'd probably still rather go in and pay because you're used to it.
[00:36:46.898 --> 00:36:47.398]  It's a habit.
[00:36:47.958 --> 00:36:51.559]  Have you noticed when you walk down the chemical aisle, you get like a headache, you can smell it?
[00:36:52.219 --> 00:36:56.780]  I mean, have you read the stuff that's in there, all the studies, what it does to you, what you're breathing?
[00:36:57.708 --> 00:37:01.310]  I mean, you leave that stuff between your legs or under your arms, it burns you.
[00:37:01.330 --> 00:37:02.731]  Not Calvin Peirceau, baby.
[00:37:03.351 --> 00:37:08.655]  All right, I always get him up and make him sit there while I rant and rave and slobber all over the product.
[00:37:09.055 --> 00:37:19.101]  But it really is a good product, and you support a patriotic broadcast, and it's a great deal, and so it fits the bill for us to have a great sponsor like you, Marty.
[00:37:19.121 --> 00:37:19.961]  We're honored to have you.
[00:37:20.001 --> 00:37:20.802]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:37:21.202 --> 00:37:22.062]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:37:22.143 --> 00:37:23.343]  Thank you for inviting me.
[00:37:23.363 --> 00:37:26.145]  It's always a pleasure talking to you and your listeners.
[00:37:26.664 --> 00:37:37.708]  About a program that we designed 60 years ago, and it's still successful, and we appreciate very much your endorsement of our Pure Soap products.
[00:37:38.068 --> 00:37:39.588]  You see, this is a no-brainer.
[00:37:40.348 --> 00:37:50.452]  One free phone call, get a catalog, start saving money, and get cleaning products twice as good as what you're using now.
[00:37:50.852 --> 00:37:52.112]  And we guarantee that.
[00:37:52.432 --> 00:37:54.493]  We couldn't be in business this long
[00:37:54.989 --> 00:37:56.930]  If we didn't guarantee everything.
[00:37:56.950 --> 00:38:00.011]  This is not a pyramid or a multi-level.
[00:38:00.431 --> 00:38:04.393]  It's factory direct from what we make here to you.
[00:38:04.713 --> 00:38:06.034]  It's not a hundred items.
[00:38:06.454 --> 00:38:08.555]  It's four basic items.
[00:38:08.975 --> 00:38:13.116]  Bath soap, hair soap, dish soap, and laundry soap.
[00:38:13.437 --> 00:38:14.957]  And they'll do hundreds of jobs.
[00:38:15.517 --> 00:38:22.400]  Don't need all these all-purpose cleaners and pre-soaks and floor cleaners and window cleaners and all these chemicals and solvents.
[00:38:22.440 --> 00:38:23.981]  Most of these are poisonous chemicals.
[00:38:24.318 --> 00:38:26.219]  The ingredients are poisonous.
[00:38:26.639 --> 00:38:30.561]  They're detrimental to your health, to your children, to your home.
[00:38:31.021 --> 00:38:32.102]  Don't need it anymore.
[00:38:32.402 --> 00:38:35.563]  We sort of designed a three-step program.
[00:38:36.564 --> 00:38:37.164]  Three steps.
[00:38:37.184 --> 00:38:41.766]  The first step, call our toll-free number, get a free catalog.
[00:38:42.086 --> 00:38:43.407]  It'll explain everything.
[00:38:43.887 --> 00:38:48.849]  Step number two, call once you get our catalog or we can include it along.
[00:38:49.169 --> 00:38:50.850]  We've designed a one-month program
[00:38:51.280 --> 00:39:04.413]  Tote bag, sampler of our Pure Soap products, a generous supply of our bath soap and hair soap and dish soap and laundry soap, a book of instructions, a catalog we can send along with it.
[00:39:04.694 --> 00:39:05.875]  That's step number two.
[00:39:05.895 --> 00:39:14.664]  Step number three is the big step because that's when you make a commitment to a one-year supply of our Pure Soap products.
[00:39:15.186 --> 00:39:15.666]  $125 plus shipping.
[00:39:15.686 --> 00:39:18.008]  It comes out to $3.25 a week for over 52 weeks.
[00:39:25.020 --> 00:39:27.781]  What can you buy for three and a quarter anymore?
[00:39:28.101 --> 00:39:28.961]  Can't buy anything.
[00:39:29.141 --> 00:39:30.482]  Well, let's be specific here.
[00:39:30.502 --> 00:39:35.603]  You know, there's so much hype out there in the world that people tune in and go, yeah, I'm sure it's great soap.
[00:39:35.643 --> 00:39:36.284]  Yeah, sure, right.
[00:39:36.704 --> 00:39:49.368]  Folks, there was normal soap in this country before the big chemical giants came in and created an oligopoly, a syndicate, a cartel, like OPEC, here in North America and, of course, in Europe.
[00:39:49.961 --> 00:39:52.123]  And they created very destructive chemicals.
[00:39:52.183 --> 00:39:59.029]  They just bought up the market and they sell you very expensive products.
[00:39:59.489 --> 00:40:00.110]  It's a scam.
[00:40:01.566 --> 00:40:04.247]  These soaps that Marty makes really are soaps.
[00:40:04.307 --> 00:40:05.268]  They're not detergents.
[00:40:05.828 --> 00:40:08.450]  And they're made out of plants.
[00:40:09.791 --> 00:40:11.492]  There is no animal products in it.
[00:40:11.532 --> 00:40:13.554]  There is no artificial chemicals in it.
[00:40:13.574 --> 00:40:16.756]  They have the state of California organic certification.
[00:40:16.776 --> 00:40:18.077]  One of the strongest in the country.
[00:40:18.678 --> 00:40:21.239]  And Marty's father started the company with Marty back in 1947.
[00:40:21.880 --> 00:40:24.562]  60 year anniversary coming up here in just a few months.
[00:40:25.262 --> 00:40:27.804]  And I really want to challenge you both.
[00:40:28.681 --> 00:40:32.922]  To give Marty a call and get the free catalog at 800-340-7091.
[00:40:32.942 --> 00:40:33.202]  1-800-340-7091.
[00:40:33.362 --> 00:40:41.725]  Or 5starsoap.com or calbinsoap.com.
[00:40:42.165 --> 00:40:46.927]  If you go to infowars.com, there's a big banner on the left-hand side.
[00:40:46.947 --> 00:40:49.867]  And we have text links on prisonplanet.com every day.
[00:40:50.288 --> 00:40:51.768]  Over to the side if you missed the address.
[00:40:51.808 --> 00:40:52.168]  But it's 800-340-7091.
[00:40:56.241 --> 00:40:58.362]  I love to save our listeners money.
[00:40:58.462 --> 00:41:02.303]  I love to bring you real products, serious products, things that actually have an effect.
[00:41:02.983 --> 00:41:04.604]  I use this personally in my home.
[00:41:06.965 --> 00:41:12.206]  The cartels make deals with the big supermarkets.
[00:41:12.246 --> 00:41:16.408]  They actually pay them in many cases to exclude other products.
[00:41:16.448 --> 00:41:18.008]  They pay them for shelving space.
[00:41:18.868 --> 00:41:20.249]  It is a monopoly action.
[00:41:20.889 --> 00:41:26.692]  And so I think you ought to demand that Whole Foods and others carry real organic soaps like Marty's.
[00:41:27.853 --> 00:41:30.594]  I don't know why Whole Foods hasn't shaped ways and Kroger's haven't.
[00:41:31.035 --> 00:41:33.316]  Believe me, I wish I'd have known about this soap earlier.
[00:41:33.336 --> 00:41:35.237]  And let me explain something.
[00:41:35.277 --> 00:41:36.878]  Marty was a sponsor on Genesis.
[00:41:37.538 --> 00:41:43.281]  He just heard of my show, sent me a year's supply, and like an idiot, it sat there for a few months in the garage.
[00:41:43.321 --> 00:41:44.382]  This was like three years ago.
[00:41:45.612 --> 00:41:46.795]  My wife said, what's this?
[00:41:47.396 --> 00:41:48.719]  She opens it and starts using it.
[00:41:48.739 --> 00:41:49.400]  Oh, I love it.
[00:41:49.541 --> 00:41:50.683]  Oh, this stuff's so different.
[00:41:51.104 --> 00:41:52.206]  Oh, the babies like it.
[00:41:52.948 --> 00:41:54.170]  Oh, it doesn't give them a rash.
[00:41:55.175 --> 00:41:57.696]  Well, the coconut oils and the vegetable oils...
[00:42:20.120 --> 00:42:21.101]  Blend it together.
[00:42:21.321 --> 00:42:23.021]  We don't use perfumes.
[00:42:23.362 --> 00:42:32.846]  We use natural juices of oranges, of lemons, of cherries, extracting the juices, spraying the product with these juices.
[00:42:34.107 --> 00:42:35.367]  Perfumes are poison.
[00:42:35.708 --> 00:42:36.968]  Perfumes are toxic.
[00:42:37.328 --> 00:42:42.571]  Perfumes would burn a hole on a hardwood desk if you left it overnight.
[00:42:42.971 --> 00:42:43.711]  We don't need it.
[00:42:43.751 --> 00:42:44.492]  We don't like it.
[00:42:44.532 --> 00:42:45.272]  We don't use it.
[00:42:45.552 --> 00:42:46.993]  We just don't want to have it.
[00:42:47.355 --> 00:42:49.637]  We want the products to smell natural.
[00:42:49.957 --> 00:42:54.360]  You're like those people that think cows should be fed grass and not other dead, rotten cows.
[00:42:54.380 --> 00:42:55.160]  You're weird.
[00:42:55.180 --> 00:43:01.885]  You're one of those people that think we shouldn't probably be drinking fluoride and chlorine and herbicides.
[00:43:02.025 --> 00:43:03.086]  Don't you know that's nutritious?
[00:43:03.886 --> 00:43:07.268]  Well, yeah, if you like that, your mortician would love you for it.
[00:43:07.889 --> 00:43:11.091]  He just feels that this is another way to expand his business.
[00:43:11.957 --> 00:43:16.942]  And, of course, I always give out the toll-free number for the Poison Control, 800-222-1222.
[00:43:16.962 --> 00:43:32.258]  And you'll need it, believe me, because these products, especially the toothpaste, that they put all kinds of flavors in there, chocolate, cherries, vanilla.
[00:43:32.805 --> 00:43:34.306]  And they have right on every tube.
[00:43:34.687 --> 00:43:40.051]  If accidentally swallowed, call Poison Control Center immediately.
[00:43:40.711 --> 00:43:41.212]  It's just insane.
[00:43:41.252 --> 00:43:42.052]  And it's on number.
[00:43:42.773 --> 00:43:43.333]  It's insane.
[00:43:43.373 --> 00:43:45.235]  Marty, everybody needs to give you a call.
[00:43:45.295 --> 00:43:50.079]  I think they should get the one-month tote bag to sample it, or at the bare minimum get the free beautiful catalog.
[00:43:50.699 --> 00:43:52.461]  I suggest you call and get a year's supply.
[00:43:53.221 --> 00:43:55.263]  They've got two, three year's supplies if you want that.
[00:43:55.883 --> 00:43:58.345]  If you own a hotel, a motel, you need to use it.
[00:43:58.385 --> 00:44:00.227]  In fact, the only place I ever saw your soap,
[00:44:01.170 --> 00:44:03.753]  When I finally opened the box up and looked at it, I said, I've seen this.
[00:44:03.793 --> 00:44:09.918]  The few times I've stayed growing up with my parents traveling in finer hotels, I had seen it in fine hotels.
[00:44:10.278 --> 00:44:12.440]  Why do fine hotels carry your products?
[00:44:13.021 --> 00:44:21.689]  Well, they want something twice as good as what's available, something that will last, something that will make the people come back to their facilities.
[00:44:22.149 --> 00:44:23.210]  And this is important.
[00:44:23.270 --> 00:44:24.491]  It's a reorder business.
[00:44:24.852 --> 00:44:26.353]  It's an aftermarket business.
[00:44:26.693 --> 00:44:27.414]  They want that.
[00:44:27.873 --> 00:44:30.215]  And we sort of accommodate them to that effect.
[00:44:30.455 --> 00:44:35.038]  We're factory direct, no middlemen, no jobber, no wholesaler.
[00:44:35.198 --> 00:44:41.423]  And by the way, your clothes washing soaps, they don't eat holes in it like the detergents do.
[00:44:41.963 --> 00:44:45.005]  Unfortunately, the detergents clean too well.
[00:44:45.346 --> 00:44:47.627]  When they say stronger than dirt, they mean it.
[00:44:47.948 --> 00:44:52.571]  It cleans so well that it microscopically breaks down the fibers of the cloth
[00:44:53.317 --> 00:44:54.838]  And it ends up as lint.
[00:44:54.978 --> 00:44:58.941]  And then we know that residue of that ends up getting under our skin.
[00:44:59.522 --> 00:45:09.669]  Folks, give Marty a call, 800-340-7091, 800-340-7091, or calbinpuresoap.com or fivestarsoap.com.
[00:45:09.709 --> 00:45:11.110]  Marty, talk to you again soon, sir.
[00:45:11.651 --> 00:45:14.313]  Let me give you the sign we're putting up on the highway.
[00:45:14.893 --> 00:45:15.173]  Sure.
[00:45:15.534 --> 00:45:20.858]  For rashes, itching, redness, tearing, and well-being, don't be a dope.
[00:45:21.438 --> 00:45:22.439]  Use pure soap.
[00:45:24.033 --> 00:45:24.753]  Take care, Marty.
[00:45:25.053 --> 00:45:25.794]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:45:25.894 --> 00:45:27.174]  He's a sweetheart, folks.
[00:45:27.935 --> 00:45:28.475]  All right.
[00:45:29.375 --> 00:45:31.377]  Thank you for holding during that important announcement.
[00:45:31.437 --> 00:45:34.818]  It's a Made in America product, and I believe in it, and it's a good deal.
[00:45:35.519 --> 00:45:35.939]  All right.
[00:45:35.999 --> 00:45:39.141]  Let's go ahead and go to Andrew, holding patiently in Australia.
[00:45:39.161 --> 00:45:40.301]  Thanks for holding here on the air.
[00:45:41.822 --> 00:45:43.083]  Yes, Alex.
[00:45:43.243 --> 00:45:45.184]  Great to talk with you.
[00:45:45.264 --> 00:45:48.026]  Basically, I'm sorry you're sick.
[00:45:48.066 --> 00:45:50.087]  Hey, I'm getting better.
[00:45:51.946 --> 00:45:52.326]  Pardon me?
[00:45:52.786 --> 00:45:53.407]  I'm getting better.
[00:45:53.447 --> 00:45:54.007]  Sorry, go ahead.
[00:45:55.267 --> 00:45:56.588]  Oh, that's very good.
[00:45:56.728 --> 00:45:58.329]  I've had a similar situation.
[00:45:58.769 --> 00:46:15.596]  I was working on... I work in the film industry, and I've worked on Matrix and other features in Fox Studio, and I've basically been hit with a similar virus to what you're suffering now.
[00:46:17.357 --> 00:46:18.478]  Now, with...
[00:46:20.871 --> 00:46:31.596]  Your videos and so forth, I've been able to put out about 200 copies on the Superman set of Martial Law 9-11.
[00:46:32.096 --> 00:46:32.637]  Oh, really?
[00:46:32.697 --> 00:46:33.037]  Wow.
[00:46:33.577 --> 00:46:47.103]  Yeah, and I managed to get that out to the point where by about seven months into the shoot, we were actually having it played on the video monitors during lunch.
[00:46:47.764 --> 00:46:48.444]  You're kidding.
[00:46:48.524 --> 00:46:49.404]  Man, you're incredible.
[00:46:49.484 --> 00:46:50.125]  I salute you.
[00:46:50.185 --> 00:46:50.545]  Thank you.
[00:46:51.514 --> 00:46:52.695]  Oh, well, thank you.
[00:46:52.855 --> 00:46:54.075]  Well, no, no, thank you.
[00:46:54.095 --> 00:47:05.419]  And at the moment I've... Now, the interesting thing is I've... You had a Unitarian pastor on the other day.
[00:47:05.900 --> 00:47:19.425]  Now, I was introduced to the Unitarian religion or doctrine, whatever, fellowship, by the Simpsons, of all people.
[00:47:20.509 --> 00:47:32.959]  When Homer said that, oh my God, only the Unitarians, oh my God, the Unitarians can't be the only religion that's got it right, which I found quite amusing.
[00:47:32.979 --> 00:47:44.969]  So I went to the Unitarians in Sydney, and what I found was interesting was it was almost a Freemason-based church.
[00:47:45.409 --> 00:47:48.592]  So I just asked to comment on that.
[00:47:50.102 --> 00:47:59.593]  Well, I know it's super liberal, and I know that it's multi-faith, and I know that that's what the globalists want in the end, is this one world religion.
[00:48:00.033 --> 00:48:02.957]  I just know the local pastor's a Vietnam vet, a good guy.
[00:48:03.709 --> 00:48:08.651]  Well, we were there in a congregation of 12, and I managed to give out five Terror Storm DVDs.
[00:48:40.179 --> 00:48:43.722]  Sounds par for the course, absolutely.
[00:48:43.782 --> 00:48:49.966]  I mean, I haven't researched that particular denomination, but I've heard what you're saying, and it is a concern.
[00:48:50.627 --> 00:48:51.368]  What do you think about it?
[00:48:51.388 --> 00:48:51.808]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:48:52.395 --> 00:49:05.625]  No, I just went there on good faith because basically I was brought up as a Catholic, although I lost my faith probably in my teens.
[00:49:05.645 --> 00:49:07.826]  Well, that's too bad.
[00:49:08.947 --> 00:49:09.187]  Sure.
[00:49:09.508 --> 00:49:16.112]  No, I mean, going back to you on the set of Superman, I know they make a lot of films in Australia.
[00:49:16.132 --> 00:49:18.034]  Do they make Superman in Australia, too?
[00:49:19.382 --> 00:49:20.444]  They did.
[00:49:20.524 --> 00:49:22.265]  We shot for nine months in Sydney.
[00:49:22.706 --> 00:49:23.587]  Yeah.
[00:49:23.687 --> 00:49:25.509]  At Fox Studios.
[00:49:25.609 --> 00:49:35.739]  So literally, you handed out a couple hundred copies of Martial Law, 9-11 Rise, The Police State, and you're saying by the end of it, it was playing on the TV monitors around the set?
[00:49:36.900 --> 00:49:37.761]  Yeah, indeed.
[00:49:38.502 --> 00:49:39.583]  What did people think about it?
[00:49:40.724 --> 00:49:41.885]  Did a Superman see it?
[00:49:42.853 --> 00:49:48.476]  Well, what was going on, I would believe that he did.
[00:49:48.796 --> 00:49:50.798]  It was the lunchtime thing.
[00:49:51.918 --> 00:49:54.320]  It would be played at lunch.
[00:49:55.140 --> 00:50:01.904]  That was... Yeah, I mean, I really pushed it hard and gave it to everybody I possibly could.
[00:50:03.205 --> 00:50:12.110]  Before that, I started out with... Before I'd gone to self-Alex, I'd had him playing tights.
[00:50:13.211 --> 00:50:13.411]  Sure.
[00:50:13.451 --> 00:50:16.373]  What do you think is better, Terror Storm or Martial Law?
[00:50:20.216 --> 00:50:24.178]  For me, Martial Law.
[00:50:25.339 --> 00:50:27.500]  That's because I'm educated now.
[00:50:28.981 --> 00:50:29.741]  Yeah, it's just long.
[00:50:29.801 --> 00:50:30.382]  It's three hours.
[00:50:30.582 --> 00:50:31.643]  I mean, I think it's a great film.
[00:50:31.663 --> 00:50:36.305]  People can't tell what their favorite is, like Road to Tyranny, Martial Law, or Terror Storm.
[00:50:36.566 --> 00:50:37.386]  I think Terror Storm.
[00:50:37.866 --> 00:50:40.848]  Well, listen, sir, it's great hearing from you from Australia.
[00:50:41.088 --> 00:50:42.129]  Anything else you'd like to add?
[00:50:43.767 --> 00:50:46.749]  Um, no, sir, that's all good.
[00:50:46.789 --> 00:50:50.972]  Just keep up the good work, and I'll keep out burning your DVDs.
[00:50:51.012 --> 00:50:51.853]  You too, listen.
[00:50:52.213 --> 00:50:53.374]  Listen, don't be a stranger.
[00:50:53.414 --> 00:50:54.095]  Call back again.
[00:50:54.635 --> 00:50:57.237]  All right, John and Skip and Jason and Bill, stay with us.
[00:51:00.880 --> 00:51:03.822]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[00:51:04.386 --> 00:51:06.287]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[00:51:06.707 --> 00:51:14.371]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:15.031 --> 00:51:22.074]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:51:22.494 --> 00:51:25.415]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran.
[00:51:25.816 --> 00:51:28.137]  A White House program to disseminate fake news.
[00:51:28.557 --> 00:51:29.517]  NSA spy.
[00:51:29.877 --> 00:51:30.958]  Secret police torture.
[00:51:31.260 --> 00:51:33.963]  The latest 9-11 information and much, much more.
[00:51:34.223 --> 00:51:37.726]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:51:38.187 --> 00:51:40.088]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:51:40.449 --> 00:51:44.352]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:52:51.737 --> 00:52:56.779]  Hello, this is Amy Bjorklund.
[00:52:57.099 --> 00:53:04.483]  Thanks to a quantum leap in garlic research, the health benefits of 20 fresh garlic cloves are now available in one tiny capsule.
[00:53:04.623 --> 00:53:12.407]  With stabilized allicin, the proven power of garlic has been transformed into what is perhaps the most important medicinal product ever developed.

[00:53:24.018 --> 00:53:32.265]  This means strong immunity, fewer and shorter colds, and the best possible protection from deadly diseases, none of which prescription drugs can offer.

[00:53:47.015 --> 00:53:49.096]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[00:53:49.116 --> 00:53:51.456]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:05.567 --> 00:54:07.088]  Let's continue with your calls.
[00:54:07.148 --> 00:54:08.609]  I'm trying to go through them a little bit quicker now.
[00:54:08.629 --> 00:54:09.990]  I'm always trying that.
[00:54:10.210 --> 00:54:12.831]  Seldom do I succeed, but they're always such good calls.
[00:54:13.732 --> 00:54:15.393]  John in Texas, you're on the air.
[00:54:15.473 --> 00:54:15.853]  Welcome.
[00:54:16.373 --> 00:54:16.653]  Hi, Alex.
[00:54:17.114 --> 00:54:17.474]  Hello.
[00:54:17.994 --> 00:54:20.215]  I was talking to my friend a couple days ago.
[00:54:20.255 --> 00:54:21.596]  He lives up on a Canadian border.
[00:54:21.856 --> 00:54:22.477]  Yes.
[00:54:23.257 --> 00:54:28.540]  And he said the Canadian news announced that 90,000 Russian soldiers are coming into Canada.
[00:54:29.560 --> 00:54:32.262]  I said, gee, you sure you weren't talking about 900 or something?
[00:54:32.322 --> 00:54:33.022]  He said, no, 90,000.
[00:54:33.222 --> 00:54:35.964]  I said, man, that's like almost 19 divisions.
[00:54:36.184 --> 00:54:37.085]  Did you Google it?
[00:54:37.245 --> 00:54:38.806]  I mean, I would have probably heard about that.
[00:54:39.706 --> 00:54:50.333]  I'm trying to find out, but what I like to do is ask any of your Canadian listeners if they could phone in and verify any of this or fax you any news articles or something, because I think this is something serious that needs to be looked into.
[00:54:50.373 --> 00:54:52.535]  What were they saying the 90,000 trips were for?
[00:54:53.455 --> 00:54:57.898]  I guess it was some kind of joint military maneuvers with the Canadians, but why 19 divisions?
[00:54:59.056 --> 00:55:10.544]  I don't know, but... I mean, Alex, if we were dealing with God-fearing Christian leaders, I'd discount this as just a big hoax and wouldn't pay any attention to it, but we've got devil-worshipping scum in charge, so you've got to take this stuff serious.
[00:55:10.584 --> 00:55:20.650]  No, listen, who would have ever thought that we'd have secret gulags in the former Eastern Bloc where they torture people, and then Bush comes out and says it isn't torture.
[00:55:21.611 --> 00:55:23.812]  It's all a complete insult to our intelligence.
[00:55:23.912 --> 00:55:24.653]  It's just all of it.
[00:55:25.857 --> 00:55:31.699]  Like I said, I'd like if any of you Canadian listeners would phone in and verify any of this or fax you any news articles.
[00:55:31.719 --> 00:55:32.799]  I'd appreciate it.
[00:55:32.879 --> 00:55:35.000]  Your friend didn't know where they'd heard it, huh?
[00:55:35.220 --> 00:55:40.701]  He said it was on the Canadian news, and he said they just announced it, that they were coming in there.
[00:55:41.042 --> 00:55:42.622]  He's been a friend of mine for 35 years.
[00:55:42.642 --> 00:55:45.943]  We're both Vietnam veterans, so he wouldn't lie to me.
[00:55:46.103 --> 00:55:47.423]  No, I don't doubt it at all.
[00:55:47.724 --> 00:55:48.624]  I'll try to check into it.
[00:55:48.644 --> 00:55:49.324]  Thanks for the call.
[00:55:49.924 --> 00:55:52.425]  Speaking of that, of invasions...
[00:55:53.328 --> 00:56:01.376]  Again, I don't watch a lot of television, but I've been in bed for four days off and on, so I watched a lot of TV when I wasn't sleeping.
[00:56:02.557 --> 00:56:06.100]  And I watched Fox, I watched CNN, I watched MSNBC.
[00:56:06.120 --> 00:56:08.963]  The only good thing I saw was Keith Oberman.
[00:56:10.624 --> 00:56:15.729]  And just the level, the propaganda has gotten... I've watched a bunch of TV.
[00:56:15.769 --> 00:56:16.470]  I mean, it's just...
[00:56:17.185 --> 00:56:22.428]  Well, I saw some TV stuck in the airport for three hours back on Tuesday night, too, and it was just like every 30 seconds we timed it.
[00:56:22.808 --> 00:56:30.452]  Al-Qaeda, bomb, attack, security, Bush, security, just brainwashing.
[00:56:31.193 --> 00:56:45.480]  But I was watching it, and the way they spun the torture, and then they also continued to spin, well, there's 11 million illegal immigrants, immigrants, migrants, we can't catch them all.
[00:56:45.500 --> 00:56:46.361]  Then I saw Bush.
[00:56:47.563 --> 00:56:50.986]  His press conference re-aired from Friday to Saturday, and he said the same thing.
[00:56:51.046 --> 00:56:52.427]  We can't catch $11 million.
[00:56:52.447 --> 00:56:53.508]  It's like a talking point.
[00:56:53.929 --> 00:56:59.554]  I heard talk show hosts this weekend saying they literally just beat this drum.
[00:57:00.174 --> 00:57:03.658]  Okay, well, if we can't stop the $30 million, it's not $11 million, by the way.
[00:57:04.999 --> 00:57:11.525]  If we can't stop the $11 million, and we've got to let in the next $30 million or whatever, then it's just a total capitulation of the world.
[00:57:11.605 --> 00:57:12.326]  Is that what you're saying?
[00:57:14.306 --> 00:57:15.687]  No, no, our government wants this.
[00:57:15.727 --> 00:57:19.488]  Our government pays them more welfare than citizens get as an incentive.
[00:57:20.128 --> 00:57:39.156]  These illegal aliens are a bunch of spoiled brats running around with their Mexican flags, shooting their mouths off about my country, and George Bush is a scumbag piece of trash traitor, and I'm sick of phony conservatives backing him up so he can bust our country wide open with the North American Union.
[00:57:39.976 --> 00:57:41.076]  Oh, man, I get mad.
[00:57:41.196 --> 00:57:42.237]  I am sick of this!
[00:57:42.839 --> 00:57:44.940]  They're actually killing our country right now.
[00:57:45.260 --> 00:58:00.809]  You've got a bunch of poor people who've been slaves for a hundred generations, here now, who are coming to the only free country left, shooting their mouths off, screaming La Raza down with the U.S., and we've got our government supporting them and 800 plus cities supporting them, and I want it to stop!
[00:58:02.830 --> 00:58:04.511]  This is the end of the country, okay?
[00:58:04.752 --> 00:58:05.312]  Period!
[00:58:06.343 --> 00:58:13.188]  And by the way, for the Mexicans that hate this country, I don't mean Mexican-Americans, I mean the Mexican illegal aliens that think this is all cute.
[00:58:14.909 --> 00:58:19.832]  Hey, why do you think the big government and the money men and the old white guys in New York and D.C.
[00:58:20.112 --> 00:58:21.633]  are letting you do this and helping you?
[00:58:21.973 --> 00:58:22.974]  They're using you.
[00:58:23.494 --> 00:58:24.655]  You're not going to get anything, okay?
[00:58:24.675 --> 00:58:25.856]  You're just going to turn the U.S.
[00:58:25.896 --> 00:58:26.756]  into Mexico City.
[00:58:27.297 --> 00:58:28.057]  You understand that?
[00:58:29.958 --> 00:58:30.539]  Unbelievable.
[00:58:33.251 --> 00:58:37.834]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[00:58:37.854 --> 00:58:38.375]  Big Brother.
[00:58:38.415 --> 00:58:39.355]  Mainstream media.
[00:58:39.375 --> 00:58:45.259]  Government cover-ups.
[00:58:45.419 --> 00:58:47.621]  You want answers?
[00:58:47.721 --> 00:58:49.282]  Well, so does he.
[00:58:57.151 --> 00:59:00.772]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:01.312 --> 00:59:05.432]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:09.113 --> 00:59:18.535]  Alright, we're into hour number two on this live Monday edition, the 18th day of September 2006.
[00:59:20.455 --> 00:59:23.076]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:59:23.736 --> 00:59:24.996]  Got about two hours left here.
[00:59:26.676 --> 00:59:28.437]  And we will be taking your calls toll-free at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:59:28.477 --> 00:59:43.167]  I'm going to take another five, six calls, and then I want to get more into the incredible attempted con job, snow job, sales job, pitch job that we're being given on torture and secret arrest.
[00:59:43.207 --> 00:59:47.030]  And if they set this precedent, it's just going to be like, where'd Billy go?
[00:59:47.090 --> 00:59:48.190]  Well, they picked him up.
[00:59:48.250 --> 00:59:49.451]  You know, it's for Homeland.
[00:59:51.132 --> 00:59:56.356]  They already tried to arrest Greg Palast, BBC, for videotaping here in the U.S.
[00:59:57.560 --> 00:59:58.480]  This is where it's going.
[01:00:00.761 --> 01:00:03.642]  And it's all for the politicians and the big banks that own them.
[01:00:05.022 --> 01:00:07.523]  Can't have their way with you and your property.
[01:00:08.083 --> 01:00:16.085]  So a lot of you out there, you just keep sticking George Bush and Hillary stickers all over your cars and sucking your thumbs and believing the media.
[01:00:16.625 --> 01:00:21.786]  And you can just all go right down the rails into Hades itself.
[01:00:21.846 --> 01:00:23.847]  And don't worry, you'll get to drag us with you too.
[01:00:24.801 --> 01:00:25.822]  I'm calling you from Marin County.
[01:00:45.990 --> 01:00:46.870]  That's California?
[01:00:47.390 --> 01:00:47.671]  Yeah.
[01:00:47.931 --> 01:00:48.271]  Welcome.
[01:00:48.291 --> 01:00:48.951]  What's on your mind?
[01:00:49.611 --> 01:00:52.232]  Well, there's two things I want to touch on in six months.
[01:00:52.632 --> 01:00:55.713]  I make as many DVDs as I can, tell everyone I can about your show.
[01:00:56.973 --> 01:01:01.695]  And I probably put in as much effort as I can, which is about 30% of my time.
[01:01:02.015 --> 01:01:04.115]  This is a little insurance policy to you.
[01:01:04.796 --> 01:01:11.938]  If anything ever happens to you, you have like a mysterious Kurt Cobain-style dad or something like that, I'm going to put in about 100% of my time.
[01:01:12.578 --> 01:01:15.279]  And I'm sure a lot of our listeners are going to be the same, so...
[01:01:17.079 --> 01:01:21.165]  For any of the globalists listening, that's a tip for them.
[01:01:21.205 --> 01:01:24.449]  Well, I think they know that, and I think that's the number one reason I'm alive.
[01:01:24.810 --> 01:01:26.011]  The number one earthly reason.
[01:01:26.031 --> 01:01:29.536]  Number one, the penultimate reason, is God's in control.
[01:01:30.037 --> 01:01:32.701]  But I've felt a lot of melancholy lately because...
[01:01:34.053 --> 01:01:36.554]  I didn't realize the effect just this show's having.
[01:01:36.594 --> 01:01:38.855]  Not just the movement and everything everyone's doing.
[01:01:39.215 --> 01:01:44.758]  I've always wanted there to be thousands of leaders and hundreds of movements and everybody having a huge effect.
[01:01:45.718 --> 01:01:51.921]  But just this broadcast alone, the people that are paying attention, the people that listen to me, it's daunting.
[01:01:52.741 --> 01:01:55.662]  So I'm honored, I'm humbled, and I mean it when I say that.
[01:01:55.822 --> 01:01:58.223]  The politician always says, I'm honored, I'm humbled.
[01:01:58.263 --> 01:02:01.825]  No, I'm really honored, I'm really humbled because I've got all these people
[01:02:02.345 --> 01:02:09.509]  Scientists and doctors and auto mechanics and old women and young people and foreigners and just everybody listening.
[01:02:11.029 --> 01:02:18.093]  It starts getting pretty ridiculous when I've got all these Hollywood people listening and people tuning in.
[01:02:19.933 --> 01:02:25.196]  The only living literary legend is a fan of the broadcast.
[01:02:25.236 --> 01:02:27.437]  I'm like, my gosh, I better do a good job.
[01:02:31.126 --> 01:02:33.187]  And of course, his name, of course, is Kurt Vonnegut.
[01:02:33.207 --> 01:02:35.467]  But, caller, go ahead and finish up what you were saying.
[01:02:36.048 --> 01:02:38.108]  Oh, the other thing is, I was going to tell you what happened on 9-11.
[01:02:38.228 --> 01:02:48.351]  I went to Sonoma State University and Santa Rosa Junior College, and there were two Project Censored truth rallies there.
[01:02:48.371 --> 01:02:48.431]  Yes.
[01:02:48.751 --> 01:02:55.673]  But the interesting thing is, I made like 50 DVDs of Loose Change and Martial Law, and
[01:02:56.448 --> 01:03:00.149]  Trying to pass them off to people, but they seem to not want your name mentioned.
[01:03:00.589 --> 01:03:01.969]  And it was really weird.
[01:03:01.989 --> 01:03:08.651]  It's like when they discuss what they're trying to say, they tell you everything they knew about 9-11.
[01:03:09.732 --> 01:03:10.652]  They question Building 7.
[01:03:11.192 --> 01:03:14.313]  They talk about the globalists, everything.
[01:03:14.373 --> 01:03:16.653]  But they would never put the pieces together.
[01:03:16.673 --> 01:03:19.674]  They never accused the Bush administration of being a part of it.
[01:03:19.834 --> 01:03:22.695]  But they'd say, it seems like they have something to do with this.
[01:03:24.469 --> 01:03:25.930]  Well, stay there.
[01:03:25.950 --> 01:03:29.791]  I want to hear specifically what they said or did kosher.
[01:03:30.472 --> 01:03:32.172]  Because I've gotten a project-centered award.
[01:03:32.493 --> 01:03:33.133]  We'll be right back.
[01:03:33.153 --> 01:03:33.513]  Stay with us.
[01:03:33.953 --> 01:03:40.976]  It's here.
[01:03:41.176 --> 01:03:45.958]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:03:46.339 --> 01:03:53.922]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:03:54.670 --> 01:04:01.714]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:04:02.115 --> 01:04:13.542]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:04:13.862 --> 01:04:17.364]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:04:17.824 --> 01:04:19.765]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:04:20.086 --> 01:04:23.908]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:04:37.401 --> 01:04:42.002]  The Berkey Security Pack is your one-stop solution for unexpected emergencies.
[01:04:42.203 --> 01:04:46.644]  It provides you with purified water, light, power, and communications ability.
[01:04:46.844 --> 01:04:58.888]  The Security Pack includes a Berkey light water purifier, Berkey sport filtration bottles, the Berkey battery adapter, the Berkey MP solar charger, as well as a backup set of two Black Berkey purification elements.
[01:04:59.108 --> 01:04:59.628]  We're good to go.
[01:05:23.353 --> 01:05:26.120]  By calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:05:30.572 --> 01:05:36.576]  I used to be ashamed of my toenails, so I thought I was destined to wear tennis shoes through the heat of the summer and hide my toes at the beach.
[01:05:36.976 --> 01:05:39.638]  And then my podiatrist told me about Non-X Nail Gel.
[01:05:39.798 --> 01:05:44.401]  It tackles unsightly nails by clearing out the cause of the problem, yellowing keratin debris buildup.
[01:05:44.561 --> 01:05:49.385]  With regular use, Non-X Gel breaks down and removes the debris, so toenails look clear.
[01:05:49.565 --> 01:05:54.308]  This summer I'm wearing open-toed sandals again, thanks to a topical natural gel called Non-X.
[01:05:54.528 --> 01:05:57.210]  If your toenails are embarrassing, I recommend Non-X Nail Gel.
[01:05:57.430 --> 01:06:00.312]  It's at your pharmacy or mass retailer in the foot care section.
[01:06:01.612 --> 01:06:02.612]  Looking for profit?
[01:06:02.692 --> 01:06:04.073]  Looking for safety and security?
[01:06:04.413 --> 01:06:07.253]  The $10 Olympic commemorative gold coin offers both.
[01:06:07.674 --> 01:06:14.955]  This low-mintage collector coin with a total series mintage under $600,000 has sold at four times its current price.
[01:06:15.295 --> 01:06:18.816]  Falling dollar values and inflation make this likely to happen again.
[01:06:19.036 --> 01:06:20.576]  Secure your position today.
[01:06:20.856 --> 01:06:22.056]  Call Midas Resources at 1-800-686-2237.
[01:06:22.137 --> 01:06:22.377]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:06:30.836 --> 01:06:36.480]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:06:37.581 --> 01:06:43.465]  All right, moving quickly through your call so I can then plunge back into the news on this live Monday edition.
[01:06:45.026 --> 01:06:47.888]  Let's go back to Skip in Northern California.
[01:06:49.970 --> 01:06:54.453]  Skip, you said that you went to the Project Censored outfit there at the local Sonoma State.
[01:06:55.340 --> 01:07:03.602]  And you said you were trying to hand out Loose Change 2nd Edition and Martial Law, and that they somehow didn't seem to like my information being handed out.
[01:07:03.642 --> 01:07:04.942]  What about the Loose Change info?
[01:07:05.982 --> 01:07:10.263]  Well, they said Loose Change is a good film, but there's some flaws with it.
[01:07:10.623 --> 01:07:14.364]  And when I asked them, what didn't you like about it?
[01:07:14.384 --> 01:07:19.505]  And they said, well, some of the theories we find questionable, but they wouldn't elaborate on it.
[01:07:20.145 --> 01:07:24.706]  Then I asked what they didn't like about you, and they just said,
[01:07:25.336 --> 01:07:27.838]  Again, some of your theories they weren't sure about.
[01:07:28.238 --> 01:07:33.982]  And when I tried to press for the information, there's a woman there named Bridget Thornton.
[01:07:34.542 --> 01:07:37.324]  She gave me her email address and she said, we'll talk about this later.
[01:07:37.344 --> 01:07:40.025]  Well, it's a free country.
[01:07:40.045 --> 01:07:42.427]  They weren't trying to stop you from handing those out, were they?
[01:07:43.488 --> 01:07:46.569]  No, they weren't trying to stop me from handing them out.
[01:07:46.670 --> 01:07:53.494]  But when they'd hear me mention your name, because a few people were coming up to me, I was like one of the only people passing out DVDs.
[01:07:54.321 --> 01:07:58.463]  And I'd write... I also wrote prisonplanet.tv on a desk.
[01:07:58.483 --> 01:07:59.624]  They'd ask me, what is this site?
[01:08:00.485 --> 01:08:01.725]  What information is here?
[01:08:04.427 --> 01:08:06.828]  Then she came up to me a couple times.
[01:08:07.889 --> 01:08:12.912]  But hey, you know, maybe you shouldn't really discuss him here.
[01:08:13.292 --> 01:08:14.553]  I didn't understand what she meant.
[01:08:14.773 --> 01:08:22.217]  Well, you ought to write an email up about that, Tess, and maybe Project Censored can give themselves an award next time and put themselves in their own book.
[01:08:23.338 --> 01:08:23.878]  I don't think it was...
[01:08:24.423 --> 01:08:26.304]  I don't think it was Project Censored per se.
[01:08:26.324 --> 01:08:28.564]  I think it was just these two people talking about it.
[01:08:28.584 --> 01:08:31.025]  Yeah, I was about to say, I know the professor that heads it up.
[01:08:31.065 --> 01:08:31.765]  He's a good guy.
[01:08:33.346 --> 01:08:35.567]  So he probably doesn't even know what's going on.
[01:08:36.807 --> 01:08:37.947]  Well, it just seemed weird to me.
[01:08:37.987 --> 01:08:38.888]  That's all I'm telling you.
[01:08:39.188 --> 01:08:40.308]  No, no, it's freaky.
[01:08:40.908 --> 01:08:48.471]  Listen, the left doesn't like me because real leftists that have done their research know I'm for controlling the border.
[01:08:49.211 --> 01:08:50.391]  I'm for the Second Amendment.
[01:08:51.132 --> 01:08:52.092]  I'm against abortion.
[01:08:53.147 --> 01:08:56.369]  I just tell it like it is, and I appreciate your call, sir, and your support for the truth.
[01:08:57.229 --> 01:09:00.011]  And I'm not here to make Republicans happy.
[01:09:00.031 --> 01:09:01.832]  I'm not here to make Democrats happy, okay?
[01:09:02.752 --> 01:09:06.094]  And I'm a constitutionalist, and I try to stand up for the downtrodden.
[01:09:06.654 --> 01:09:09.936]  I have an instinct to stand up for the weak, and that's what I do.
[01:09:11.176 --> 01:09:16.199]  And they don't like it that I'm for unborn babies, and they don't like it that I'm for controlling our borders.
[01:09:16.989 --> 01:09:23.833]  I mean, we've got a mass of 30 million people running around saying, down with the USA, down with the USA, up with Osloin.
[01:09:24.774 --> 01:09:26.695]  I mean, if that's not a threat, I don't know what is.
[01:09:26.875 --> 01:09:30.798]  Listen, I don't have to get up in the morning and think, well, what position do I have on this?
[01:09:31.138 --> 01:09:32.539]  I just go with what's right.
[01:09:33.079 --> 01:09:34.960]  It's so easy to just tell the truth.
[01:09:36.241 --> 01:09:37.622]  My job is so easy.
[01:09:38.563 --> 01:09:40.964]  Most of these controlled media people, they have a hard job.
[01:09:41.004 --> 01:09:45.107]  They've got to spin and lie and twist and cover up for their past lies.
[01:09:48.681 --> 01:10:01.373]  And so, we've been very successful at waking up what you'd call just mainstream leftists, people who thought they were given the choice of, are you going to be a Republican or are you going to be a Democrat?
[01:10:01.753 --> 01:10:09.260]  And they automatically saw the incredible hypocrisy and corruption and evil of the Republican Party going back many years, and they said, well, then I'm a Democrat.
[01:10:10.071 --> 01:10:11.271]  We're good to go.
[01:10:11.311 --> 01:10:11.491]  I think?
[01:10:32.230 --> 01:10:33.691]  Going, hey, I'm out buying guns.
[01:10:33.731 --> 01:10:34.292]  I'm getting ready.
[01:10:34.332 --> 01:10:35.292]  I'm not going to a camp.
[01:10:35.833 --> 01:10:36.994]  Liberals need to buy guns.
[01:10:37.394 --> 01:10:38.635]  You see, it's a total shift.
[01:10:39.175 --> 01:10:42.638]  The left has never made sense because they're establishment lapdogs.
[01:10:42.898 --> 01:10:44.940]  Oh, they'll talk about a few problems in the country.
[01:10:45.660 --> 01:10:52.906]  Then they'll mix it in with a bunch of other issues that either don't matter or actually help the centralization of power, which they claim is going to help the average person.
[01:10:52.946 --> 01:10:53.826]  It never does in history.
[01:10:53.866 --> 01:10:59.911]  It's going to help big centralized money interests that are big enough to control the levers of government.
[01:11:00.620 --> 01:11:05.845]  The average person, or even small group, or even large group, will never be able to manipulate and control levers.
[01:11:06.745 --> 01:11:08.887]  Okay, you have to reduce the size of levers.
[01:11:10.469 --> 01:11:12.791]  And then decentralize those levers.
[01:11:13.291 --> 01:11:14.992]  That's where freedom and liberty comes from.
[01:11:15.052 --> 01:11:20.277]  Not, let's build big, gigantic, centralized government with huge mechanisms of control.
[01:11:21.078 --> 01:11:23.560]  And that will then save everyone.
[01:11:23.580 --> 01:11:28.384]  And then meanwhile, it's Carnegie and Ford and Rockefeller endowments funding the whole thing.
[01:11:31.112 --> 01:11:48.002]  And don't think for a minute that I'm not aware of the fact that the New World Order is trying to come in and infiltrate the 9-11 truth movement, trying to put leftists into the head positions of it, to try to minimize it and steer it and blame it on the U.S.
[01:11:48.623 --> 01:11:50.564]  I've been saying this for five years.
[01:11:51.224 --> 01:11:54.206]  I saw early on that 9-11 was so sloppy it was going to come out.
[01:11:56.460 --> 01:11:57.921]  And I said, the globalists aren't stupid.
[01:11:57.941 --> 01:12:06.607]  They've done mathematical computer war game computations and calculations in the strategia, and they know that there's a very good chance this is going to come out.
[01:12:07.047 --> 01:12:21.997]  So they're planning, and have been planning, for a limited hangout, as it's called, to then never have anybody go to prison for 9-11, but let it become publicly known, really demonize conservatism in this country, finally ax conservatism for all time.
[01:12:22.117 --> 01:12:23.358]  End of the Republican Party, folks.
[01:12:24.755 --> 01:12:34.362]  And then just a total controlled establishment, neo-liberal, neo-fascist takeover of the United States rolled into a North American union and then world government.
[01:12:35.083 --> 01:12:37.725]  And that's what's being set up right now.
[01:12:38.165 --> 01:12:49.633]  Though the establishment is starting to panic because the lines between left and right are imploding and the real left in this country is finally seeing through it and they're going, don't call me a leftist, I just want freedom.
[01:12:50.928 --> 01:12:51.848]  I mean, I've experienced it.
[01:12:51.868 --> 01:12:52.949]  I've been all over this country.
[01:12:52.989 --> 01:12:57.031]  And let me just tell you, the Republican Party is dead, and so are the Democrats.
[01:12:57.931 --> 01:13:00.893]  And here's an example.
[01:13:01.673 --> 01:13:04.534]  They had polls the last few months, a whole string of them.
[01:13:05.655 --> 01:13:10.637]  And depending on which poll, it's in the 70s to the 80s, mid-70s to mid-80s.
[01:13:10.877 --> 01:13:13.738]  The American people do not trust anybody in the government.
[01:13:13.779 --> 01:13:16.780]  They hate the whole government now, in some cases 85%.
[01:13:16.820 --> 01:13:16.880]  And
[01:13:19.858 --> 01:13:21.359]  That means Republicans and Democrats.
[01:13:21.399 --> 01:13:22.379]  That is wonderful news.
[01:13:22.499 --> 01:13:32.844]  In the past, they would just dislike one party at a time and love the other party, and then the globalists just kept tag-teaming us with this fake wrestling, you know, good cop, bad cop routine.
[01:13:33.224 --> 01:13:35.265]  People finally just saw through that, okay?
[01:13:37.606 --> 01:13:42.428]  And so now the entire government, never in modern polling have they had numbers even anywhere near this.
[01:13:44.133 --> 01:13:50.774]  You're going to have your die-hard idiot Republicans and your die-hard idiot Democrats who aren't going to see through this and aren't going to know what's going on.
[01:13:52.155 --> 01:13:53.295]  But it doesn't matter.
[01:13:53.515 --> 01:13:55.475]  I mean, I'm here to tell you, the shift has happened.
[01:13:56.476 --> 01:13:58.216]  And the globalists overplayed their hand.
[01:13:58.256 --> 01:13:59.156]  It blew up in their face.
[01:13:59.196 --> 01:14:02.857]  Now, that's what I forgot about leftists.
[01:14:02.917 --> 01:14:05.418]  And this is how I would argue with an establishment leftist.
[01:14:05.438 --> 01:14:07.738]  I would say, okay, America's turning into a police state, right?
[01:14:07.758 --> 01:14:09.018]  They're building FEMA camps, right?
[01:14:09.378 --> 01:14:10.979]  They're doing all these oppressive things, right?
[01:14:11.059 --> 01:14:11.859]  Yes, yes, yes.
[01:14:12.521 --> 01:14:19.406]  But the answer to that is we need to go turn our guns in to the government so they can then oppress us in whatever way they wish.
[01:14:19.467 --> 01:14:24.450]  And they'd go, well, they'd know what to say.
[01:14:25.191 --> 01:14:27.653]  Then I'd have, well, wait a minute, you like Che Guevara, don't you?
[01:14:28.113 --> 01:14:29.414]  Yes, I do like Che Guevara.
[01:14:30.155 --> 01:14:33.337]  Well, Che Guevara is always pictured with his AK-47 above his head.
[01:14:33.497 --> 01:14:34.118]  Famous photo.
[01:14:37.112 --> 01:14:39.834]  Why is it good if Che Guevara's armed but not good if we're armed?
[01:14:43.097 --> 01:14:45.339]  Again, they just can't... Oh, Native Americans!
[01:14:45.359 --> 01:14:50.683]  You like to wear t-shirts of Native Americans that say the first homeland security.
[01:14:52.024 --> 01:14:55.947]  You've got a picture of Geronimo on your shirt with a rifle.
[01:14:58.429 --> 01:15:04.254]  So, why are you now suddenly against the citizens having rifles?
[01:15:05.555 --> 01:15:05.915]  You see...
[01:15:06.861 --> 01:15:16.508]  How is it given to you as a sacrament or some type of benchmark or canon or prerequisite of your liberal religion that we not have guns?
[01:15:19.490 --> 01:15:21.252]  And Lord knows guns do horrible things.
[01:15:21.312 --> 01:15:22.493]  That is, people with guns do.
[01:15:22.853 --> 01:15:24.034]  Lord knows cars do.
[01:15:24.294 --> 01:15:25.375]  Lord knows pools do.
[01:15:26.416 --> 01:15:29.278]  By the way, cars and pools are many hundreds of times more dangerous.
[01:15:29.338 --> 01:15:30.459]  Hundreds of times more dangerous.
[01:15:30.499 --> 01:15:32.380]  Go look up the New Albany statistics.
[01:15:32.440 --> 01:15:33.581]  It just came out for last year.
[01:15:33.601 --> 01:15:35.062]  It always came out six, eight months later.
[01:15:37.794 --> 01:15:40.295]  I mean, why don't you just find out for yourself?
[01:15:40.535 --> 01:15:42.895]  And stop shaking and quaking in fear.
[01:15:43.175 --> 01:15:50.377]  I mean, I used to think the average liberal was in on the thing to take over and get our guns and enslave us until I'd actually been around some.
[01:15:51.037 --> 01:15:52.657]  And you could say, now I'm going to show you a gun.
[01:15:52.697 --> 01:15:59.799]  You can pull one out of your house, it's unloaded, and they're literally shaking like you have got an alien egg or something.
[01:15:59.819 --> 01:16:00.739]  You know from the movie Alien.
[01:16:00.779 --> 01:16:03.279]  It's about to jump out and suck their guts out or something.
[01:16:05.320 --> 01:16:06.640]  It's like you've got a king cobra.
[01:16:08.683 --> 01:16:12.306]  It's like you've got a gestating Satan.
[01:16:12.506 --> 01:16:29.496]  I mean, it's like, here is a gun, and they literally start quaking and shaking, and it's because they were never around guns, they were brought up, when a bumblebee flew by, mommy said run, and they yelled, and they were afraid of bullies, and they're not even bad people.
[01:16:31.562 --> 01:16:33.663]  These are just, they're not even cowardly.
[01:16:33.703 --> 01:16:39.586]  They're domesticated city dwellers who have had their manhood and their womanhood taken from them.
[01:16:39.886 --> 01:17:00.517]  And if you just explain that to them and explain how it is a rite of passage, a signet, a logo, a symbol, and a real substance, a foundation of personal power and independence to have weapons, they will then be baptized into the church of freedom.
[01:17:01.491 --> 01:17:03.432]  And they will go out and they will take a lesson.
[01:17:03.472 --> 01:17:04.192]  I suggest they do.
[01:17:04.232 --> 01:17:05.613]  And they will fire that gun.
[01:17:06.053 --> 01:17:07.754]  And they will take it out and they will start shooting it.
[01:17:07.774 --> 01:17:08.994]  And they will become proficient.
[01:17:09.254 --> 01:17:11.275]  And their whole personality will change.
[01:17:11.535 --> 01:17:15.077]  Not like there's some wild-eyed nut now, but they're empowered.
[01:17:15.677 --> 01:17:17.798]  And they see how stupid they were before.
[01:17:18.178 --> 01:17:24.141]  And by that very act, they have now been reborn to a great extent.
[01:17:24.161 --> 01:17:25.201]  I don't mean that spiritually.
[01:17:25.241 --> 01:17:26.362]  I just mean mentally.
[01:17:28.875 --> 01:17:31.177]  So, you need to go out and take shooting lessons.
[01:17:31.718 --> 01:17:34.480]  You need to go out and shoot a .22, say, revolver first.
[01:17:35.941 --> 01:17:39.825]  Just go out to a shooting range, tell the person, you know, you call them, hey, do you have a .22?
[01:17:40.045 --> 01:17:42.287]  You give lessons, don't you?
[01:17:42.347 --> 01:17:45.530]  Or, well, no, we don't have one, but you can go to this gun shop and buy one.
[01:17:45.830 --> 01:17:52.156]  Go buy yourself a little .22 revolver and let them have the shooting target 10 feet away and just shoot it.
[01:17:52.896 --> 01:17:54.698]  You're going to laugh at how it's no big deal.
[01:17:57.992 --> 01:18:00.213]  I mean, I've seen knock-kneed liberals before.
[01:18:00.253 --> 01:18:04.675]  They'll be up on their roof with a powerful nail gun, as dangerous as a .22, or more.
[01:18:05.195 --> 01:18:07.816]  They're just shooting those nails right into solid oak.
[01:18:09.136 --> 01:18:10.637]  Or shooting nails right into pine.
[01:18:10.657 --> 01:18:11.597]  They're not worried about it.
[01:18:11.977 --> 01:18:13.638]  Because nobody told them to be afraid of that.
[01:18:14.138 --> 01:18:20.321]  It's like nobody told you to be afraid of something that's a lot bigger threat than a spinach.
[01:18:20.641 --> 01:18:23.542]  And I'll talk about that briefly when we get back, and I promise we'll go to your calls.
[01:18:24.022 --> 01:18:24.822]  Alright, stay with us.
[01:18:24.882 --> 01:18:26.563]  Caller got me off there, as they always do.
[01:18:31.619 --> 01:18:36.563]  Now you can bring Berkey purification power anywhere with the Sport Berkey filtration bottle.
[01:18:36.883 --> 01:18:42.307]  Ideal for sporting games, camping or boating, or Sport Berkey is small enough to store in your glove box.
[01:18:42.347 --> 01:18:46.650]  So it's ideal backup for unexpected emergencies like blackouts, floods, or earthquakes.
[01:18:46.991 --> 01:18:50.013]  It's simply the best personal water filtration system available.
[01:18:50.313 --> 01:18:53.756]  So effective you can drink raw, untreated water from lakes, rivers, and streams.
[01:18:54.076 --> 01:19:03.420]  Unlike other sport bottles, the Sport Berkey's patented filter formulation is so powerful it removes cysts, parasites, harmful bacteria, and chemicals like herbicides and pesticides.
[01:19:03.680 --> 01:19:07.182]  It even reduces radon-222, lead, and other heavy metals.
[01:19:07.422 --> 01:19:14.545]  This lightweight, rugged 22-ounce filter is small enough to go everywhere, so take one to work and keep another in your glove box for emergencies.
[01:19:14.785 --> 01:19:16.146]  Get the Berkey Sport for only $39.

[01:19:32.139 --> 01:19:33.941]  Ted Anderson from Midas Resources.
[01:19:34.041 --> 01:19:36.223]  Today is September 18th, 2006.
[01:19:36.423 --> 01:19:41.627]  Gold opened at $579.50 and one ounce gold coins can be purchased for $611.30.
[01:19:42.488 --> 01:19:45.570]  Again, that's $611.30 to purchase one ounce gold coins.
[01:19:46.051 --> 01:19:53.577]  With a slow economy, real estate prices dropping, war on terrorism, the economic climate in the United States is questionable.
[01:19:53.817 --> 01:19:54.078]  U.S.
[01:19:54.118 --> 01:19:57.480]  citizens work a third of their life just to cover tax liabilities.
[01:19:57.741 --> 01:20:00.543]  Bankruptcies continue to weaken financial institutions.
[01:20:00.883 --> 01:20:14.125]  Midas is offering the hard-hitting report by Greg McCoach, covering the seven reasons for gold to move higher, calling for $1,000 an ounce, exposing the debt structure, central bank buying, the China effect, and much more.
[01:20:14.145 --> 01:20:18.906]  Call today for a free copy, 800-686-2237.
[01:20:19.326 --> 01:20:23.227]  Our government may be bound to repeat, so arm yourself with knowledge, 800-686-2237.
[01:20:23.267 --> 01:20:23.447]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:20:31.189 --> 01:20:34.491]  Do you remember when you could eat most anything and not worry about it?
[01:20:34.971 --> 01:20:37.132]  Or maybe weight management has always been a problem.
[01:20:37.652 --> 01:20:43.015]  Are you frustrated, burned out, and tired of fad diets and marketing gimmicks that don't really work?
[01:20:43.555 --> 01:20:49.438]  Do you want a proven system, a long-term solution to live a healthier lifestyle and properly manage your weight?
[01:20:50.189 --> 01:20:53.270]  At WeCanTogether.com, our approach is different.
[01:20:53.711 --> 01:20:55.391]  We focus on the whole you.
[01:20:55.871 --> 01:20:58.433]  Personalized for your unique body composition.
[01:20:59.073 --> 01:21:01.114]  Individual needs and personal goals.
[01:21:01.654 --> 01:21:03.855]  Not the cookie cutter approach offered by others.
[01:21:04.628 --> 01:21:06.690]  Go to WeCanTogether.com That's WeCanTogether.com
[01:21:30.939 --> 01:21:33.420]  David J. Smith for News Watch Magazine.
[01:21:34.100 --> 01:21:46.923]  Has anyone told you how the Patriot Acts number one and two is the groundwork to eliminate all of our freedoms guaranteed to us by the Bill of Rights that they infringe upon the First, Second, Fourth, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendment?
[01:21:47.983 --> 01:21:49.804]  This is minimum infringement.
[01:21:50.204 --> 01:21:51.044]  There may be more.
[01:21:52.184 --> 01:21:58.906]  Is your guaranteed right to freedom of speech, assembly, religion, privacy, and to own a gun important to you?
[01:21:59.665 --> 01:22:07.531]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[01:22:08.351 --> 01:22:09.892]  Just call our toll-free number, 1-800-516-8736.
[01:22:09.912 --> 01:22:10.253]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[01:22:10.273 --> 01:22:10.553]  Call now.
[01:22:10.613 --> 01:22:14.676]  Our operators are standing by to take your orders.
[01:22:36.886 --> 01:22:37.446]  We're good to go.
[01:22:37.466 --> 01:22:37.746]  I think?
[01:23:07.687 --> 01:23:24.561]  Many of the policies and views and mindsets that are out there by mainline liberals, I do not detest the individuals themselves, and I'm more than happy and willing to try to wake them up so they can be free human beings and see how evil the Democratic Party is.
[01:23:24.621 --> 01:23:33.669]  It's a pack of eugenics, loving, land-grabbing, socialistic people who think it's for the people when really it's for the elite.
[01:23:34.321 --> 01:23:38.223]  And you explain that to a, you know, grassroots liberal, they'll finally wake up.
[01:23:39.903 --> 01:23:44.665]  Hey, don't worry, you can still hate your robber barons, I just want to inform you that you actually work for them.
[01:23:45.405 --> 01:23:45.825]  You see?
[01:23:46.346 --> 01:23:48.226]  And you show them that, they'll actually wake up.
[01:23:48.246 --> 01:23:56.950]  But if you try to come up to them and, I'm a Republican, and we're good and you're bad, I mean, they're going to laugh at you because they know how corrupt the Republicans are.
[01:23:58.390 --> 01:24:02.872]  Alright, there's been a death, and now like 120-something people got sick.
[01:24:03.516 --> 01:24:11.238]  From packaged leaves of spinach supposedly grown by one company out in California.
[01:24:11.278 --> 01:24:13.838]  Lots of fear-mongering, lots of scare-mongering going on.
[01:24:14.518 --> 01:24:17.919]  And one person dying is terrible, and 100 getting sick is terrible.
[01:24:18.659 --> 01:24:24.000]  But that is really nothing compared to what I see on health department reports.
[01:24:24.600 --> 01:24:30.661]  Listeners around the country send me health department warnings and different reports and the occasional news article that does slip out.
[01:24:31.522 --> 01:24:33.142]  And there were only what?
[01:24:34.190 --> 01:24:34.851]  We're good to go.
[01:24:34.871 --> 01:24:35.111]  I think?
[01:24:56.668 --> 01:25:05.372]  And the federal government's own numbers report that 44 people will get tuberculosis from one co-worker or one student that has it.
[01:25:06.633 --> 01:25:09.974]  And we know that TB is exploding coast to coast.
[01:25:10.534 --> 01:25:16.397]  They now have TB sanitariums like they had back in the 50s all over the United States.
[01:25:16.477 --> 01:25:17.738]  It's kept very quiet.
[01:25:19.238 --> 01:25:22.940]  We now have amoebas that we did never have here before.
[01:25:23.060 --> 01:25:24.601]  Now we have wondrous amoebas.
[01:25:25.726 --> 01:25:27.647]  The type that attack the brain are killing people.
[01:25:28.267 --> 01:25:31.369]  We have weird skin-burrowing worms and amoebas.
[01:25:32.929 --> 01:25:38.612]  And, you know, for those that haven't been to third world countries, they just think open borders are great.
[01:25:39.192 --> 01:25:46.775]  You know, back when it was predominantly just Europeans coming to this country, still, stuff was pretty bad, pretty third world over there.
[01:25:47.396 --> 01:25:52.278]  And when you came into Ellis Island, you got tested, you got treated, and you didn't come in until you were cured or you got sent back.
[01:25:53.254 --> 01:25:53.834]  Not now.
[01:25:54.035 --> 01:25:54.675]  Oh, no.
[01:25:54.975 --> 01:25:55.876]  No, no, no.
[01:25:56.196 --> 01:26:06.962]  We'll take your illegal alien kids with all of the wonderful diseases they've got, and we're bad to report on this, and we'll stick them there coughing all over everybody else's kids.
[01:26:06.982 --> 01:26:08.203]  I don't care what color your kid is.
[01:26:08.223 --> 01:26:08.763]  Do you love them?
[01:26:10.324 --> 01:26:13.846]  We'll stick them in there with the TB and the meningitis.
[01:26:13.966 --> 01:26:16.508]  Oh, yeah, I looked at the meningitis death numbers a few months ago.
[01:26:17.308 --> 01:26:18.549]  They're off the charts now.
[01:26:19.321 --> 01:26:21.002]  Don't worry, the government's got a vaccine for you.
[01:26:21.222 --> 01:26:23.623]  We won't stop all the illegal aliens pouring in.
[01:26:23.903 --> 01:26:31.847]  We'll just try to force a dangerous vaccine on everybody in the public schools now and the colleges because meningitis is killing a bunch of people.
[01:26:32.167 --> 01:26:42.972]  Hey, I know two people who've lost sons in Austin, Texas in the last year from spinal meningitis that attacks your brain and spinal cord.
[01:26:43.453 --> 01:26:44.153]  It isn't pretty.
[01:26:45.854 --> 01:26:48.275]  And it's always third world students.
[01:26:49.474 --> 01:26:51.496]  Two people I know had college students at UT.
[01:26:52.196 --> 01:26:56.780]  I mean, you send your son and daughter to UT, it's a joke.
[01:26:57.581 --> 01:27:02.946]  I mean, it's the equivalent of sending in their lunch lettuce that you know has E. coli on it.
[01:27:06.389 --> 01:27:13.295]  And you watch, when your son or daughter gets it, and they die of it, it'll be a minor footnote, or it won't even be in the news when they get TB.
[01:27:14.170 --> 01:27:15.812]  We'll just be, honey, be quiet about it.
[01:27:15.852 --> 01:27:18.174]  We've got a $50,000 drug regimen.
[01:27:18.214 --> 01:27:19.435]  It might cure you.
[01:27:19.635 --> 01:27:22.698]  Well, we keep it under control, and you've got yellow skin now.
[01:27:23.179 --> 01:27:26.302]  We've got to put you on all these dangerous, toxic drugs that also eat your liver.
[01:27:26.722 --> 01:27:27.663]  But that's okay.
[01:27:27.703 --> 01:27:31.967]  You've got to go to UT with all the illegal aliens everywhere.
[01:27:31.987 --> 01:27:36.691]  And I'm bad.
[01:27:37.865 --> 01:27:39.306]  ADL and others have reports out.
[01:27:39.546 --> 01:27:51.351]  The anti-immigrant population likes to talk about diseases and other racist... Hey, man, there's nothing racist talking about the fact that Mexico has got one of the highest disease levels in the world.
[01:27:51.992 --> 01:28:00.255]  Half their public in Mexico City, biggest city in the world, 33 million, last time I checked, growing every year, live in cardboard boxes.
[01:28:00.335 --> 01:28:02.456]  They use the bathroom outside, okay?
[01:28:02.917 --> 01:28:05.878]  They have to wear masks almost every day in Mexico City.
[01:28:06.585 --> 01:28:11.531]  Because the air is brown with the dried human detritus.
[01:28:12.732 --> 01:28:14.715]  And we're going to be living just like that here, folks.
[01:28:14.735 --> 01:28:17.077]  But don't worry, they got a vaccine for it.
[01:28:19.520 --> 01:28:20.421]  We're on the march.
[01:28:20.902 --> 01:28:22.483]  The empire's on the run.
[01:28:22.504 --> 01:28:26.128]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:30.140 --> 01:28:32.641]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network.
[01:28:32.742 --> 01:28:35.123]  I have an urgent message for all of our listeners.
[01:28:35.183 --> 01:28:41.367]  The mass media keeps telling us that we are the richest, most powerful economy in the world.
[01:28:42.847 --> 01:28:45.149]  If this is true, why can't we pay our bills?
[01:28:45.789 --> 01:28:49.351]  Why is the United States the world's largest debtor nation?
[01:28:49.891 --> 01:28:54.034]  The truth is that we are in the worst debt bubble in our nation's history.
[01:28:54.594 --> 01:28:57.556]  When the bubble bursts, will you be able to feed your family?
[01:28:58.539 --> 01:29:01.460]  When the inevitable crash occurs, will you be ready?
[01:29:02.200 --> 01:29:07.941]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.
[01:29:08.001 --> 01:29:11.282]  That's 1-888-892-6238.
[01:29:11.522 --> 01:29:16.103]  For the following two free reports, U.S.
[01:29:16.183 --> 01:29:19.104]  Debt Bubble, Red Alert, and Real Estate Crash.
[01:29:20.064 --> 01:29:22.345]  Call 888-8XANADU.
[01:29:22.405 --> 01:29:26.606]  That's 888-8XANADU.
[01:29:26.946 --> 01:29:27.906]  And ask for George.
[01:29:30.600 --> 01:29:31.641]  The war on terrorism.
[01:29:31.961 --> 01:29:34.744]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[01:29:35.025 --> 01:29:39.169]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[01:29:39.609 --> 01:29:40.430]  So what do you do?
[01:29:40.750 --> 01:29:45.315]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[01:29:45.799 --> 01:29:46.379]  We're good to go.
[01:30:15.679 --> 01:30:17.579]  By now, it is no surprise that the U.S.
[01:30:17.599 --> 01:30:22.140]  ranks 37th in the world in occurrence of chronic illness, according to the World Health Organization.
[01:30:22.180 --> 01:30:26.721]  Due to modern farming and food processing practices, our food supply has become neutralized.
[01:30:47.645 --> 01:30:48.185]  We're good to go.
[01:31:17.585 --> 01:31:17.985]  We're good to go.
[01:31:47.919 --> 01:31:58.253]  There must be some kind of way out of here Said a joker to the thief There's too much confusion
[01:32:00.962 --> 01:32:05.324]  Oh yeah, you tell them, Jimmy.
[01:32:05.344 --> 01:32:07.304]  Thank you for joining us.
[01:32:07.384 --> 01:32:10.025]  I'm going into my rant.
[01:32:28.539 --> 01:32:29.940]  This is how it works, okay?
[01:32:30.420 --> 01:32:31.501]  We're the schmucks.
[01:32:31.681 --> 01:32:32.621]  We're the jokes.
[01:32:32.801 --> 01:32:33.762]  We're the pigs.
[01:32:33.862 --> 01:32:34.822]  We're the cows.
[01:32:35.202 --> 01:32:36.223]  We're to be bled.
[01:32:36.323 --> 01:32:37.364]  We're the donkeys.
[01:32:37.424 --> 01:32:40.965]  We're the jackasses to pull the plow for the New World Order.
[01:32:41.045 --> 01:32:44.187]  We're the fat, dumb, and happy that trust everything.
[01:32:44.447 --> 01:32:47.649]  We are the laughing stock of the world.
[01:32:48.269 --> 01:32:51.331]  Top Air Force General comes out and says, we've got microwave weapons.
[01:32:51.731 --> 01:33:00.135]  We need to use them on our own population first to convince the world they're safe because this violates all these rules on using these on enemies in war.
[01:33:00.975 --> 01:33:03.376]  Let's just use it on our dumb cattle.
[01:33:03.436 --> 01:33:04.276]  They'll love it.
[01:33:08.038 --> 01:33:09.679]  It's the same thing with the illegal aliens.
[01:33:10.079 --> 01:33:11.600]  We as citizens pay...
[01:33:12.443 --> 01:33:17.008]  For their tuition, their medical care, to have their babies, everything.
[01:33:17.128 --> 01:33:23.995]  We subsidize them so they can then go work at Walmart and the meat packing plants and in construction.
[01:33:24.255 --> 01:33:33.585]  And then we have all these thousands of media hit pieces about how the economy would come to a standstill if it wasn't for all the wonderful illegal aliens.
[01:33:35.413 --> 01:33:37.674]  And oh, what will we do without them?
[01:33:37.774 --> 01:33:38.994]  Oh, they're so sweet.
[01:33:39.454 --> 01:33:41.455]  And they love America so much.
[01:33:41.915 --> 01:33:44.436]  When, frankly, most of these illegal aliens hate this country.
[01:33:45.076 --> 01:33:45.456]  Okay?
[01:33:45.796 --> 01:33:47.616]  I'm talking about the illegal aliens from Mexico.
[01:33:47.836 --> 01:33:53.778]  They've been taught, nationalistically, from birth, that the Southwest belongs to Mexico.
[01:33:54.098 --> 01:33:55.899]  And now they just think the whole thing does.
[01:33:55.979 --> 01:33:59.880]  And the head of Chicano Studies at UT, you know, I talk about this stuff.
[01:33:59.920 --> 01:34:00.700]  I'm not making it up.
[01:34:01.040 --> 01:34:04.081]  He now says not just all whites 16 and older need to die.
[01:34:04.821 --> 01:34:08.163]  He now says that all whites need to die.
[01:34:08.363 --> 01:34:12.866]  I mean, you know, we got the head of UT Chicano Studies saying all whites need to die.
[01:34:13.126 --> 01:34:14.186]  Frankly, I'm sick of that.
[01:34:14.246 --> 01:34:18.329]  You ought to be ashamed of yourself, you racist piece of filth, you trash!
[01:34:19.395 --> 01:34:20.916]  You ought to be ashamed of yourself.
[01:34:21.196 --> 01:34:21.896]  I'm not ashamed.
[01:34:21.916 --> 01:34:22.457]  You understand?
[01:34:22.497 --> 01:34:23.717]  We're not ashamed anymore.
[01:34:23.978 --> 01:34:25.198]  We haven't done anything.
[01:34:25.398 --> 01:34:28.880]  We're not afraid to get up and tell you you're a racist piece of trash.
[01:34:29.421 --> 01:34:29.861]  Okay?
[01:34:30.341 --> 01:34:38.506]  You want the same type of society like you got in Mexico where you can sit up on top of all your slaves and tell everybody what to do and you come to the wrong place for that.
[01:34:38.806 --> 01:34:40.907]  You and George Bush and all the rest of you.
[01:34:43.374 --> 01:34:44.995]  Why do you think these people want this?
[01:34:45.335 --> 01:34:46.876]  They want us to be a third world country.
[01:34:46.896 --> 01:34:53.799]  We're all a bunch of pathetic slaves scurrying around and they live upon the big mansions on the hill with their armed guards laughing at us.
[01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:57.681]  Elites have always been in competition against the middle class.
[01:35:01.221 --> 01:35:02.923]  But you can't tell the illegal aliens that.
[01:35:02.963 --> 01:35:11.691]  It's too much fun to go to the radio station functions where it's all openly spoken about how they're taking over and how they're going to get us and ha ha ha and we're dying ha ha ha.
[01:35:12.232 --> 01:35:15.275]  It just feels too good at a primitive level.
[01:35:16.443 --> 01:35:18.044]  Meanwhile, I mean, imagine how perfect this is.
[01:35:18.064 --> 01:35:21.065]  You've got this guilty, liberal U.S.
[01:35:21.105 --> 01:35:26.687]  society with all these Americans going around, totally guilty for stuff they didn't do.
[01:35:26.707 --> 01:35:30.449]  You know, just literally head hung, all pathetic.
[01:35:30.809 --> 01:35:33.930]  Oh, please, don't think I'm a racist.
[01:35:34.310 --> 01:35:35.971]  I want to be your friend.
[01:35:36.571 --> 01:35:43.337]  And then meanwhile, you've got a huge third world population that's been enslaved for thousands of years who want some type of revolution.
[01:35:43.437 --> 01:35:48.781]  The establishment knows that, so they're shunting it into a false revolution of overthrowing the U.S.
[01:35:49.061 --> 01:35:56.227]  They've got billions of dollars in massive foundation and think tank and bank funding, corporation funding.
[01:35:56.367 --> 01:35:57.608]  Openly, go look at this, the most funding.
[01:35:58.829 --> 01:36:02.672]  They've got another language so the dumbbell public doesn't know what's going on.
[01:36:03.562 --> 01:36:04.803]  I mean, literally, folks.
[01:36:04.863 --> 01:36:06.885]  Just huge masses going, we're going to kill you.
[01:36:06.925 --> 01:36:09.568]  The time of the murdering starts soon.
[01:36:09.768 --> 01:36:12.330]  The time of the murdering starts soon.
[01:36:12.570 --> 01:36:14.932]  The time of the murdering starts soon.
[01:36:15.333 --> 01:36:18.316]  And then, meanwhile, I'm just sitting there going, hey, you're controlled by the big banks.
[01:36:18.336 --> 01:36:19.437]  You're going to break down the U.S.
[01:36:19.637 --> 01:36:20.518]  You won't get any freedom.
[01:36:20.758 --> 01:36:20.998]  Shut up!
[01:36:21.178 --> 01:36:22.018]  We'll kill you, too.
[01:36:22.619 --> 01:36:24.420]  And the general public's going, well, that's quite racist.
[01:36:24.440 --> 01:36:26.881]  You shouldn't talk about all the leprosies everywhere.
[01:36:26.901 --> 01:36:28.922]  You shouldn't be talking about the meningitis.
[01:36:29.142 --> 01:36:32.324]  You shouldn't be talking about all the weird worms that burrow into your skin.
[01:36:32.364 --> 01:36:36.205]  You shouldn't be talking about how it's spreading and how people you know have gotten it.
[01:36:36.446 --> 01:36:37.606]  You should just love it.
[01:36:38.046 --> 01:36:39.147]  You should just love it.
[01:36:39.507 --> 01:36:40.487]  It's fun.
[01:36:40.588 --> 01:36:41.648]  It's good.
[01:36:43.109 --> 01:36:46.290]  But wait, there's a report about the evil spinach.
[01:36:46.350 --> 01:36:47.411]  It's going to kill you.
[01:36:51.957 --> 01:36:55.238]  Don't worry, they've got a new virus they plan to spray on some of the meats.
[01:36:55.259 --> 01:36:56.379]  They've now announced this, of course.
[01:36:56.399 --> 01:37:00.021]  They've got a new virus they spray on the vegetables, too.
[01:37:00.081 --> 01:37:02.882]  It eats off all the bad bacteria.
[01:37:04.543 --> 01:37:08.744]  Yeah, just, again, the usual problem is that this spinach is grown in Mexico.
[01:37:08.784 --> 01:37:10.385]  They keep saying they don't know what caused it.
[01:37:10.765 --> 01:37:11.205]  Let me see.
[01:37:11.225 --> 01:37:16.648]  E. coli is a bacteria that lives in human feces.
[01:37:18.366 --> 01:37:20.488]  And what does Mexico spray their crops with?
[01:37:20.928 --> 01:37:21.969]  Human feces.
[01:37:23.210 --> 01:37:25.792]  And they've got a law where you don't even get to know where country of origin.
[01:37:25.812 --> 01:37:27.533]  You don't even get to know where the food came from.
[01:37:30.035 --> 01:37:30.876]  So you better scrub it.
[01:37:30.896 --> 01:37:32.057]  You better wash it, folks.
[01:37:34.879 --> 01:37:36.500]  We're absolutely cursed by Mexico.
[01:37:36.520 --> 01:37:39.963]  I mean, Mexico is this country's curse and probably will.
[01:37:40.043 --> 01:37:41.905]  Feel real good, slaves.
[01:37:41.925 --> 01:37:44.086]  You're going to get to be slaves here, too.
[01:37:44.126 --> 01:37:45.347]  Probably will be its downfall.
[01:37:45.387 --> 01:37:46.168]  The globalists know that.
[01:37:46.929 --> 01:37:58.120]  Almost 100 million people, population doubling every 30-something years, funded by our government, sworn to bring this country down, and then they got the government and Mexico against us.
[01:37:58.160 --> 01:37:58.701]  We can't win.
[01:38:02.645 --> 01:38:05.528]  And so there's just all this mindless, idiotic pride.
[01:38:06.288 --> 01:38:10.733]  Meanwhile, if conservatives woke up, they could defeat this, but they won't because they're still worshipping George Bush.
[01:38:13.195 --> 01:38:18.336]  I'll get into the torture, and then the neocons are saying, next attack imminent, Muslims ordered to leave the United States.
[01:38:19.916 --> 01:38:22.577]  Oh, no, it's another just made-up report.
[01:38:25.817 --> 01:38:28.758]  So we'll be getting into that and a lot more.
[01:38:28.818 --> 01:38:30.958]  Right now, who's been holding the longest here?
[01:38:33.839 --> 01:38:34.759]  Guys there at the network?
[01:38:37.720 --> 01:38:38.560]  Who's up first here?
[01:38:42.452 --> 01:38:43.373]  All right!
[01:38:44.214 --> 01:38:45.915]  Jason in Texas, you're on the air.
[01:38:45.996 --> 01:38:46.756]  Go ahead, Jason.
[01:38:47.317 --> 01:38:47.717]  Hey, buddy.
[01:38:48.038 --> 01:38:49.119]  I have a lot on my mind.
[01:38:49.159 --> 01:38:52.102]  I don't really know how people that... Well, just go ahead and run with it.
[01:38:52.122 --> 01:38:52.842]  You've got the floor.
[01:38:52.862 --> 01:38:57.927]  I just want to give you a shout of praise real quick for following what the Word of God says in Ephesians 5.11.
[01:38:58.207 --> 01:39:04.814]  The Apostle Paul commands that we do not take part in acts of evil, but we expose and rebuke them.
[01:39:05.436 --> 01:39:14.298]  And I just wish these Christians would see this evil and not be no longer deceived by the wolves in sheep's clothing that Jesus Christ warned us about.
[01:39:15.358 --> 01:39:23.159]  And if you think about what these politicians and these evil people are wearing, they're wearing sheep's clothing, suits made of wool.
[01:39:23.739 --> 01:39:26.640]  And what's amazing is the amount of... Hello?
[01:39:28.140 --> 01:39:29.200]  I'm listening to you, bro.
[01:39:29.280 --> 01:39:29.980]  I'm listening to you.
[01:39:30.480 --> 01:39:30.740]  Okay.
[01:39:31.140 --> 01:39:34.461]  Just the amount of biblical prophecy that...
[01:39:35.492 --> 01:39:39.736]  Just gives credence to exactly what is going on in the world today.
[01:39:40.657 --> 01:39:47.923]  Like for instance, I don't know if you've read Micah 7.3, but it says, "...both hands are skilled in doing evil.
[01:39:48.424 --> 01:39:49.705]  The ruler demands gifts.
[01:39:50.346 --> 01:39:51.807]  The judge accepts bribes.
[01:39:52.307 --> 01:39:54.449]  The powerful dictate what they desire.
[01:39:54.890 --> 01:39:56.271]  They all conspire together."
[01:39:57.455 --> 01:40:01.216]  I mean, I've read the whole Bible pretty much several times.
[01:40:01.236 --> 01:40:03.456]  But government doesn't ever conspire.
[01:40:03.496 --> 01:40:05.037]  The Bible's lying.
[01:40:05.497 --> 01:40:07.397]  It's a conspiracy theory.
[01:40:07.978 --> 01:40:10.438]  The churches say we should worship government.
[01:40:10.798 --> 01:40:11.738]  Do what it says.
[01:40:11.798 --> 01:40:13.159]  Don't listen to the Bible.
[01:40:14.239 --> 01:40:15.239]  But you know what?
[01:40:15.839 --> 01:40:21.061]  What some people don't see is that Romans 13, it says, you know, submit to the authorities.
[01:40:21.501 --> 01:40:23.961]  That means submit to the laws that are here for us.
[01:40:24.422 --> 01:40:26.262]  We can still obey all the laws.
[01:40:26.883 --> 01:40:28.223]  And expose this evil.
[01:40:28.683 --> 01:40:33.184]  You know, Jesus Christ, he submitted to the people above him.
[01:40:33.204 --> 01:40:38.825]  He didn't go against the Pharisees and Sadducees, yet he spoke against what they were doing.
[01:40:39.425 --> 01:40:43.626]  And, you know, we need to use the sword of our mouths, as he said, and start exposing that.
[01:40:43.646 --> 01:40:52.968]  If I go to Texas Tech in Lubbock, I don't have the money to buy a DVD burner and burn a bunch of CDs and give them out to people, but what I can do is throw down ten bucks to make a bunch of copies.
[01:40:53.942 --> 01:41:00.444]  Well, you can also go get Terror Storm on Google Video for free and just email it out to everybody.
[01:41:00.464 --> 01:41:00.624]  Exactly.
[01:41:00.644 --> 01:41:00.844]  Yeah.
[01:41:00.864 --> 01:41:03.325]  I mean, all my friends that I run with have become aware.
[01:41:16.224 --> 01:41:17.085]  Of what's going on.
[01:41:17.425 --> 01:41:28.871]  But what I've come to find is that you've got to have a relationship with Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit living inside of you for this to pack any power because that's where your courage comes from.
[01:41:28.891 --> 01:41:31.173]  In a sense, that's where your balls come from, you know?
[01:41:31.893 --> 01:41:38.397]  If you're just aware of all this evil and you don't have the back of God, God's back, you know, you're not going to get much done.
[01:41:38.417 --> 01:41:40.258]  And you are a man of God.
[01:41:40.298 --> 01:41:45.841]  I heard your talk on your radio show the other night
[01:41:46.283 --> 01:41:51.405]  And you were talking about how you felt the presence of God and you felt the Holy Ghost with you when you were in Ottawa at the Bilderbergs.
[01:41:52.526 --> 01:41:58.528]  And that's because God loves you and He wants to protect you of darkness, but also because you're doing what the Bible commands.
[01:41:59.789 --> 01:42:03.410]  Well, I appreciate the call and I appreciate what you're doing, my friend.
[01:42:04.450 --> 01:42:06.291]  Yeah, we don't have faith at times like these.
[01:42:06.811 --> 01:42:07.432]  We have nothing.
[01:42:07.452 --> 01:42:09.312]  And that's why the world is so evil today.
[01:42:09.853 --> 01:42:11.293]  People think it's all about now.
[01:42:12.374 --> 01:42:13.794]  It's all about what you can get today.
[01:42:13.834 --> 01:42:15.275]  It's all about only caring about yourself.
[01:42:15.922 --> 01:42:19.443]  But the truth is, even in this life, you're miserable when you live like that.
[01:42:22.664 --> 01:42:26.745]  I mean, things, at a certain point, you need things to be secure to feed your family.
[01:42:27.945 --> 01:42:30.606]  You need a nice car so it doesn't break down.
[01:42:31.346 --> 01:42:33.106]  You need a good roof over the head.
[01:42:34.607 --> 01:42:39.208]  It's nice to have some extra money to go on a vacation, see some interesting places.
[01:42:40.028 --> 01:42:44.069]  But at a certain point, I'm not saying wealth is bad either.
[01:42:44.696 --> 01:42:59.066]  But at a certain point, just to do anything, just to idolize wealth and to make that your God and put that above everything and put that above your morals and make that first, it's incredible.
[01:43:00.407 --> 01:43:02.228]  And those people are so unhappy.
[01:43:04.750 --> 01:43:07.892]  Speaking of money, I have spent a lot of money lately.
[01:43:09.073 --> 01:43:14.297]  And I have a tendency of having to make myself plug videos and books on this radio show.
[01:43:16.434 --> 01:43:19.596]  If you believe in what we're doing, you need to get my new film, Terror Storm.
[01:43:19.616 --> 01:43:22.858]  You need to make copies of it and get it out to everybody in your area.
[01:43:23.098 --> 01:43:24.979]  And it's having a huge effect.
[01:43:24.999 --> 01:43:27.681]  I don't have to tell you again how big an effect it's having.
[01:43:27.761 --> 01:43:34.245]  But if you already have a copy of Terror Storm and you haven't made copies of it, please start doing it now.
[01:43:35.806 --> 01:43:38.087]  And number two, if you haven't gotten a copy, get a copy.
[01:43:40.549 --> 01:43:43.851]  And if you'd like to order a bunch of copies from us, let's say you want to support us.
[01:43:44.011 --> 01:43:44.151]  Well...
[01:43:45.251 --> 01:43:47.372]  You can call 512-291-5750.
[01:43:48.553 --> 01:43:52.916]  If they don't answer, they'll call you back.
[01:43:54.197 --> 01:43:55.898]  We're trying to get better and better about that around here.
[01:43:55.918 --> 01:43:57.099]  512-291-5750 for bulk orders.
[01:43:57.159 --> 01:43:58.920]  You can also do bulk orders by calling 1-888-253-3139.
[01:44:11.760 --> 01:44:13.201]  888-253-3139.
[01:44:13.221 --> 01:44:24.570]  And I really do want to encourage you to help us get Terror Storm out to people.
[01:44:25.731 --> 01:44:29.433]  You can get them as low as like $9 a piece when you buy a whole bunch of copies.
[01:44:31.455 --> 01:44:37.800]  And I just... I sincerely hope that all of you out there will...
[01:44:38.576 --> 01:44:39.917]  We'll help us in this fight.
[01:44:39.937 --> 01:44:41.178]  We'll help us spread the word.
[01:44:41.258 --> 01:44:45.060]  We'll help us educate others in your area.
[01:44:46.761 --> 01:44:52.665]  Because we don't have a choice when we're up against just such incredible evil.
[01:44:53.686 --> 01:44:54.847]  And we've got to face the horror.
[01:44:54.867 --> 01:45:01.011]  And if we don't face the horror and force others to face the horror, the same criminals that carried out 9-11 are going to keep carrying out other attacks.
[01:45:02.912 --> 01:45:07.895]  So please, go to Infowars.com and order as many of the books and videos as you'd like.
[01:45:08.502 --> 01:45:09.742]  As many as you can afford.
[01:45:10.443 --> 01:45:11.723]  And give them as gifts to people.
[01:45:11.783 --> 01:45:12.463]  Resell them.
[01:45:13.263 --> 01:45:14.764]  I don't care what you do with my videos.
[01:45:14.804 --> 01:45:15.624]  Make copies of them.
[01:45:16.364 --> 01:45:18.425]  The bottom line is we also do need your support.
[01:45:18.445 --> 01:45:19.805]  That's another reason to get the videos.
[01:45:19.825 --> 01:45:25.407]  Not just to fight the New World Order, but also support this show and hence fight the New World Order yet again.
[01:45:25.427 --> 01:45:30.828]  I've got to always remember to take time out to encourage you to support us.
[01:45:31.329 --> 01:45:32.749]  You can also go to prisonplanet.tv.
[01:45:32.769 --> 01:45:34.309]  There's monthly memberships for $5.95.
[01:45:34.349 --> 01:45:35.230]  That's about 15 cents a day.
[01:45:37.329 --> 01:45:39.150]  You can get a yearly membership and get three months free.
[01:45:39.170 --> 01:45:47.133]  About $0.15 a day, all 15 of my films in super high quality, Terror Storm, in a quality way above Google Video.
[01:45:49.034 --> 01:45:52.755]  You can burn it on the disc right there all day long, give people high quality copies that way.
[01:45:54.516 --> 01:45:57.697]  There's my weekly TV reports, where I put a bunch of the raw footage.
[01:45:59.078 --> 01:46:00.278]  By raw, it's semi-raw.
[01:46:00.298 --> 01:46:04.780]  We're obviously going to have to take hours and hours of it to find out which parts to use, but rough cuts, basically.
[01:46:05.726 --> 01:46:06.887]  Of stuff that went on in New York.
[01:46:06.947 --> 01:46:07.827]  Speeches and things.
[01:46:07.867 --> 01:46:14.810]  Just like we put up 18 plus hours there on prisonplanet.tv or the 9-11 Neocon Agenda Symposium from L.A.
[01:46:15.891 --> 01:46:28.236]  This speech from my speech and Jim Marsh's speech is from Dallas or up there for members at prisonplanet.tv but we don't beat you over the head with it here about supporting us.
[01:46:29.897 --> 01:46:33.898]  But our goal is getting the word out and we can do a lot more if we have more support.
[01:46:33.938 --> 01:46:34.979]  So again
[01:46:35.669 --> 01:46:40.691]  Please support us, support the country, support the planet by getting the videos at Infowars.com.
[01:46:41.131 --> 01:46:44.933]  And I want to thank all of you that have supported us.
[01:46:44.993 --> 01:46:49.895]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[01:46:52.116 --> 01:46:54.817]  Let's go ahead and talk to Jim in Texas.
[01:46:54.857 --> 01:46:55.597]  Jim, you're on the air.
[01:46:58.359 --> 01:46:58.839]  Hey, Alex.
[01:46:59.279 --> 01:47:00.159]  Hey, what's up, Jim?
[01:47:01.040 --> 01:47:03.941]  Saturday I cornered a puppet of the New World Order.
[01:47:04.600 --> 01:47:07.381]  Namely, Rick Perry, governor of Texas.
[01:47:07.842 --> 01:47:15.145]  I cornered him in a restaurant, and I lectured him like a schoolmarm on his many shortcomings.
[01:47:17.426 --> 01:47:25.851]  And I told him why I should be governor of Texas or somebody like me who has courage, who has conviction, instead of himself.
[01:47:26.691 --> 01:47:31.513]  Then, when he chose to run from the conversation, he had to elbow his way past me.
[01:47:31.554 --> 01:47:32.414]  I wouldn't let him out.
[01:47:33.194 --> 01:47:34.775]  I literally did have him cornered.
[01:47:35.355 --> 01:47:37.377]  He fled to his campaign bus.
[01:47:39.478 --> 01:47:45.822]  And I gave chase and fired a couple more verbal broadsides at him while he ran away, Alex.
[01:47:47.984 --> 01:47:50.405]  I'm told I had a video crew there.
[01:47:50.425 --> 01:47:51.286]  Did they get that on tape?
[01:47:52.306 --> 01:47:54.188]  Yeah, they got it on tape, Alex.
[01:47:56.169 --> 01:47:58.290]  I'd shaken off his bodyguards along the way.
[01:47:58.330 --> 01:48:00.872]  They wanted to arrest me, but I told them it was...
[01:48:02.529 --> 01:48:06.250]  It was not their property, and I had a right to be on the premises.
[01:48:06.990 --> 01:48:09.790]  Of course, then their little flunky owner came out.
[01:48:09.870 --> 01:48:16.652]  He wanted me to... He wanted me charged with trespassing, but I didn't go that route either.
[01:48:16.672 --> 01:48:17.772]  That was a public event.
[01:48:17.952 --> 01:48:19.472]  Where was that, out in the hill country?
[01:48:19.552 --> 01:48:20.933]  It was in Dripping Springs.
[01:48:22.893 --> 01:48:23.673]  Yeah, I heard about that.
[01:48:24.533 --> 01:48:24.914]  Yeah.
[01:48:25.434 --> 01:48:27.334]  I take that boy to his car all the time.
[01:48:27.374 --> 01:48:30.495]  He doesn't want to talk to me too much.
[01:48:30.535 --> 01:48:32.155]  When I force a conversation on him
[01:48:32.734 --> 01:48:43.522]  He's just... Well, you know, if Rick Perry doesn't do exactly what they say, they will bring out a bunch of dirt on him and sink him.
[01:48:43.542 --> 01:48:44.783]  He's just a pathetic person.
[01:48:45.383 --> 01:48:46.964]  They've got a lot of dirt on him.
[01:48:47.004 --> 01:48:48.105]  He's an empty suit.
[01:48:49.486 --> 01:48:56.691]  But hey, Alex, when can I come on your show and explain to Texas voters why Texas needs a fighter in charge of things?
[01:48:59.013 --> 01:49:00.474]  We'll do it sometime soon, Jim.
[01:49:02.216 --> 01:49:02.917]  November 7th.
[01:49:02.997 --> 01:49:03.777]  Come on, Doug!
[01:49:05.399 --> 01:49:06.259]  I'll tell you what, Jim.
[01:49:09.062 --> 01:49:12.405]  And it's not that we don't like you calling, but you call way too much.
[01:49:13.706 --> 01:49:18.590]  Don't call up bugging me about it again, and I already told you I'd have you on the show, but if you keep it up, I'm not going to.
[01:49:20.711 --> 01:49:22.813]  That's what I need to get Jim Dillon on my tail now.
[01:49:22.833 --> 01:49:26.036]  All right, we'll come back and take some more calls here.
[01:49:27.257 --> 01:49:28.278]  Mike and others.
[01:49:32.546 --> 01:49:35.709]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[01:49:36.049 --> 01:49:38.011]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[01:49:38.371 --> 01:49:46.037]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:49:46.718 --> 01:49:53.763]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:49:54.163 --> 01:49:57.106]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran.
[01:49:57.486 --> 01:49:59.828]  A White House program to disseminate fake news.
[01:50:00.228 --> 01:50:00.949]  NSA spy.

[01:50:29.666 --> 01:50:33.230]  Do you know where the 78 potentially active volcanoes in the U.S.
[01:50:33.290 --> 01:50:33.791]  are located?
[01:50:33.991 --> 01:50:37.374]  And do you know the locations of the top 300 prime terrorist targets?
[01:50:37.595 --> 01:50:42.299]  You can find these answers and more in the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA.

[01:51:29.287 --> 01:51:36.133]  In December 2005, CNN had a special documentary about the inevitability of nuclear terrorism on American soil.
[01:51:36.393 --> 01:51:41.958]  When the mainstream media is reporting on such a perilous topic with such candor, it should be taken very seriously.
[01:51:42.278 --> 01:51:48.844]  Currently for sale by owner, the ultimate secure home is strategically located in the awesome mountains of southwest Colorado.
[01:51:49.064 --> 01:51:55.850]  This patented steel-reinforced concrete earth home was built to withstand any natural or man-made disaster you can name.
[01:51:56.110 --> 01:52:05.157]  Whether that be a forest fire, an earthquake, or even a full-scale nuclear attack, the house is completely off-grid with solar electricity and an independent water supply.
[01:52:05.377 --> 01:52:08.859]  It even has a hidden fallout shelter with NBC air filtration.
[01:52:09.179 --> 01:52:12.582]  Its many self-sufficient and high-security features will amaze you.
[01:52:12.942 --> 01:52:20.288]  With nuclear World War III looming ever closer on the horizon, this custom survival home is turnkey, ready for a new owner.

[01:52:32.038 --> 01:52:38.063]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:52:38.663 --> 01:52:41.626]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:52:57.656 --> 01:52:58.877]  Welcome back, my friends.
[01:52:58.937 --> 01:53:01.179]  Let's try to hurry through some of your calls now.
[01:53:01.279 --> 01:53:05.041]  Let's talk to David in Texas, then Adam and others.
[01:53:05.261 --> 01:53:06.262]  You're on the air, David.
[01:53:07.122 --> 01:53:07.683]  Hi, Alex.
[01:53:07.843 --> 01:53:08.803]  Great to always talk to you.
[01:53:08.963 --> 01:53:09.664]  Nice talking to you.
[01:53:10.453 --> 01:53:13.175]  I just wanted to share some things with you real quick.
[01:53:14.617 --> 01:53:17.639]  I've been telling people forever, as long as you've been telling people.
[01:53:18.560 --> 01:53:19.901]  And it's been working.
[01:53:20.242 --> 01:53:23.585]  And then I decided I would start doing another avenue.
[01:53:24.045 --> 01:53:25.686]  And that was I started a band.
[01:53:26.707 --> 01:53:28.509]  And we even called ourselves an inside job.
[01:53:29.510 --> 01:53:35.295]  And then I found out about an organization that's doing something on October 5th, Thursday.
[01:53:35.315 --> 01:53:35.395]  Okay.
[01:53:36.149 --> 01:53:52.476]  It's called the World Can't Wait Organization, and they're doing a nationwide walkout out of schools, out of work, and I've been put in charge of the Dallas-Fort Worth area, and I needed some good advice of an area you would suggest would be good for protest.
[01:53:54.877 --> 01:54:02.241]  I mean, city hall's not bad, or you can protest outside the media and demand that they cover what's really happening in this country, but...
[01:54:03.875 --> 01:54:06.816]  The World Can't Wait group, aren't they an anti-war group, mainly?
[01:54:07.797 --> 01:54:13.079]  Yes, well, actually, this whole protest nationwide is to push the Bush regime out of the White House.
[01:54:15.220 --> 01:54:16.481]  Well, sounds good to me.
[01:54:16.921 --> 01:54:18.802]  I mean, I'm not up in Dallas.
[01:54:18.882 --> 01:54:21.263]  I'm honored you would ask me where you think you should demonstrate.
[01:54:21.923 --> 01:54:25.505]  But I would have everybody really congregate in one spot.
[01:54:26.005 --> 01:54:28.466]  And if it's walking distance, you know...
[01:54:29.591 --> 01:54:30.972]  No further than a quarter mile.
[01:54:31.353 --> 01:54:34.215]  You can also then have everybody walk to that other place.
[01:54:34.255 --> 01:54:35.956]  That always looks real good to have a march.
[01:54:36.837 --> 01:54:37.197]  Okay.
[01:54:37.417 --> 01:54:42.582]  And then the fourth and final thing, because even though I'm just starting doing this, I don't feel it's enough.
[01:54:42.862 --> 01:54:44.603]  So I'm going to do the biggest thing I can think of.
[01:54:45.764 --> 01:54:47.586]  I'm going to run for President of the United States.
[01:54:49.207 --> 01:54:50.708]  And I would like you to be an advisor.
[01:54:51.769 --> 01:54:52.429]  Okay.
[01:54:52.550 --> 01:54:54.911]  I'm speaking with Kinky Friedman in two weeks.
[01:54:55.472 --> 01:54:58.014]  And I'm going to talk to him about it as well.
[01:54:58.889 --> 01:55:00.990]  All right, well, listen, I appreciate your call, my friend.
[01:55:01.630 --> 01:55:04.131]  And I'm not knocking running for president.
[01:55:04.632 --> 01:55:13.095]  I just, so many times I've talked about how, well, running for anything is good because you can use it as a platform to educate people.
[01:55:13.976 --> 01:55:22.039]  But if you ran for, say, city councilman, you might be able to actually do something.
[01:55:22.079 --> 01:55:28.262]  And then I think Dallas is one of the few cities that didn't pass our legislation to throw out the Patriot Act.
[01:55:29.818 --> 01:55:31.099]  You could do that there in Dallas.
[01:55:32.099 --> 01:55:34.961]  Or you could move to stop fluoridation of the water in Dallas.
[01:55:35.061 --> 01:55:42.404]  Or you could move to not have the city finance medical treatment to illegal aliens.
[01:55:42.464 --> 01:55:44.965]  Or at least not make them get special treatment.
[01:55:44.985 --> 01:55:47.326]  And if you investigate, you'll find out that that is how it works.
[01:55:47.406 --> 01:55:54.430]  It's known that you're an illegal alien in front of the line because everybody else has jumped through hoops, but not you.
[01:55:57.379 --> 01:56:03.944]  Or as you could demand the police department prosecute businesses that were hiring illegal aliens.
[01:56:04.004 --> 01:56:08.367]  Or when you caught illegal aliens engaging in crimes, you know, most of the time they just get released now.
[01:56:09.608 --> 01:56:12.611]  But the railway killer had been caught like eight, nine times.
[01:56:13.631 --> 01:56:16.794]  I mean, folks, it isn't just that illegal aliens get the same rights as citizens.
[01:56:16.834 --> 01:56:18.175]  They're way above us.
[01:56:18.695 --> 01:56:19.616]  And they know it, too.
[01:56:19.636 --> 01:56:20.456]  They brag about it.
[01:56:22.698 --> 01:56:25.060]  The government has told the whole world, hey, come here.
[01:56:25.180 --> 01:56:26.281]  Come to the United States.
[01:56:29.039 --> 01:56:29.640]  Come here.
[01:56:29.800 --> 01:56:30.500]  Take over.
[01:56:30.641 --> 01:56:31.862]  We'll pay you to come here.
[01:56:33.423 --> 01:56:35.145]  But it's all to drive the wages down.
[01:56:35.205 --> 01:56:36.646]  It's all to break this country down.
[01:56:36.686 --> 01:56:37.647]  It's all to vulcanize.
[01:56:37.987 --> 01:56:40.910]  It's all to get third world populations in here that hate this country.
[01:56:42.751 --> 01:56:46.195]  And then to get them to pull the lever for gun control, open borders.
[01:56:47.296 --> 01:56:51.179]  The government is importing a group to threaten the population with.
[01:56:51.199 --> 01:56:55.483]  I know I just keep going back to that today no matter what the caller brings up.
[01:56:57.029 --> 01:56:59.771]  But you could do so much running for local office.
[01:56:59.811 --> 01:57:01.453]  You could have a chance to win.
[01:57:02.994 --> 01:57:04.695]  Even a lower office than council member.
[01:57:05.516 --> 01:57:06.257]  We'll be right back.
[01:57:06.277 --> 01:57:06.697]  Stay with us.
[01:57:07.077 --> 01:57:07.958]  Big Brother
[01:57:27.469 --> 01:57:31.372]  You want answers?
[01:57:32.113 --> 01:57:33.013]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:33.033 --> 01:57:37.316]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:57:37.857 --> 01:57:41.940]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:57:54.503 --> 01:57:55.824]  Well, it's unbelievable.
[01:57:55.884 --> 01:57:58.225]  We're already into hour number three.
[01:57:59.706 --> 01:58:09.230]  I am your disheveled, coming off of one humdinger of a flu, host Alex Jones, and I thank you for tuning in and joining us today.
[01:58:09.250 --> 01:58:11.271]  We've got a lot of big guests lined up for you this week.
[01:58:12.792 --> 01:58:18.715]  Tons of news, and I love talking to callers because you take us in all these different directions.
[01:58:19.355 --> 01:58:22.997]  And I'm going to continue taking your calls, but I do have an Oberman clip I want to play.
[01:58:23.017 --> 01:58:23.557]  I've got like
[01:58:24.443 --> 01:58:25.043]  Three other clips.
[01:58:25.084 --> 01:58:31.308]  I've got one with Bush where he talks about how they caught an al-Qaeda operative who exposed how they put bombs in the buildings.
[01:58:31.448 --> 01:58:34.550]  I mean, what does that... Some weird slip-up about 9-11?
[01:58:34.830 --> 01:58:40.474]  And we always said they might come out and start quietly spinning.
[01:58:42.716 --> 01:58:46.138]  It was a trial balloon that, oh, al-Qaeda put bombs in the buildings.
[01:58:46.719 --> 01:58:47.880]  Now it looks like that may happen.
[01:58:48.260 --> 01:58:52.043]  I also want to comment on, you know, I made a prediction we'll have terror attacks by late October.
[01:58:52.283 --> 01:58:53.564]  Unless...
[01:58:56.269 --> 01:59:00.950]  Fox News didn't cover that part unless we expose 9-11 as an inside job.
[01:59:02.930 --> 01:59:04.110]  That's why I went to New York.
[01:59:04.150 --> 01:59:05.371]  That's why a lot of you went to New York.
[01:59:05.411 --> 01:59:07.591]  That's why we're demonstrating all over the country.
[01:59:07.631 --> 01:59:08.691]  That's why you're doing a great job.
[01:59:08.731 --> 01:59:13.112]  And we may be able to stop them, but I want to comment on some of the scary developments we're seeing there.
[01:59:14.552 --> 01:59:18.233]  Right now, let's talk to Adam in Pennsylvania.
[01:59:18.253 --> 01:59:18.913]  You're on the air.
[01:59:18.953 --> 01:59:19.313]  Welcome.
[01:59:19.373 --> 01:59:21.393]  And Joe, Adam, George, Steve, and everybody else.
[01:59:21.893 --> 01:59:22.434]  Go ahead, Adam.
[01:59:23.174 --> 01:59:23.954]  Hey, thanks, Alex.
[01:59:24.214 --> 01:59:24.694]  Thank you.
[01:59:25.345 --> 01:59:30.249]  I just wanted to say I've been a fan of yours for the last seven years.
[01:59:30.269 --> 01:59:33.812]  I've been a Prison Planet TV member for the last two years.
[01:59:34.713 --> 01:59:37.815]  And I'm finally getting optimistic about what's going on in this country.
[01:59:37.835 --> 01:59:43.840]  And I think we have a real shot at taking this country back.
[01:59:44.881 --> 01:59:47.343]  I want to just talk to you a brief moment.
[01:59:47.423 --> 01:59:50.486]  You routinely go off about Operation Northwoods.
[01:59:52.566 --> 01:59:56.809]  I've heard you mention, I believe, the Cuban flight 455.
[01:59:57.190 --> 02:00:01.453]  Alex, do you know anything about that?
[02:00:02.774 --> 02:00:03.134]  Yes.
[02:00:04.035 --> 02:00:06.417]  I mean, the CIA was caught.
[02:00:06.897 --> 02:00:09.139]  The man is Luis Carreras.
[02:00:09.539 --> 02:00:10.860]  He was a CIA agent.
[02:00:11.381 --> 02:00:20.628]  This flight was obviously blown up by the CIA, openly admitted, BBC News, and it is directly out of Operation Northwoods.
[02:00:21.529 --> 02:00:23.370]  The operation was fulfilled.
[02:00:24.231 --> 02:00:26.492]  And we've seen this terrorism before.
[02:00:27.113 --> 02:00:30.555]  We're going to see it probably again, as I think you believe as well.
[02:00:31.355 --> 02:00:38.739]  And I just think that that needs to be put in your movies more and brought to the attention of your... Well, I did put... So you haven't seen Terror Storm yet?
[02:00:39.560 --> 02:00:41.081]  I did, but I didn't see anything.
[02:00:41.101 --> 02:00:42.822]  I didn't think about the Cuban flight.
[02:00:43.002 --> 02:00:44.663]  Oh, yeah, that's actually in there.
[02:00:45.804 --> 02:00:47.885]  Oh, I must have to watch it again.
[02:00:47.905 --> 02:00:49.826]  You might have stepped out when that was on you.
[02:00:50.467 --> 02:00:54.629]  No, I hope not, but I do appreciate your films and what you're doing.
[02:00:54.769 --> 02:00:55.449]  No, no, thank you.
[02:00:55.929 --> 02:01:13.815]  And then I also wanted to say one brief second about, maybe you've also spoke about this, in the last few months, part of the Strategic Prosperity Partnership, the actual council has started to form, the North American Competitive Council, just a few months ago.
[02:01:13.835 --> 02:01:16.756]  They've had some of their documents online.
[02:01:16.816 --> 02:01:18.057]  You can see who's in this.
[02:01:18.570 --> 02:01:29.576]  There's people that work on one of Kissinger's, I forget how you say it, winemakecandles.org Foundation, Citigroup.
[02:01:30.636 --> 02:01:34.858]  And again, this is just crucial information that's out there.
[02:01:34.878 --> 02:01:36.059]  They're openly saying 2007.
[02:01:36.719 --> 02:01:39.921]  They want to have a lot of this pushed through.
[02:01:39.941 --> 02:01:42.642]  They want the quick stuff to go through right now.
[02:01:42.682 --> 02:01:43.362]  Now, let's be clear.
[02:01:43.422 --> 02:01:45.664]  We're in the North American Union right now.
[02:01:45.684 --> 02:01:46.104]  It's hard.
[02:01:48.103 --> 02:01:49.103]  Definitely agree, Alex.
[02:01:49.163 --> 02:01:49.863]  We are in it.
[02:01:49.923 --> 02:01:52.024]  I mean, NAFTA, that is the economic wing.
[02:01:52.444 --> 02:01:54.624]  Here, this is integrating everything.
[02:01:55.064 --> 02:01:56.005]  The infrastructure.
[02:01:57.125 --> 02:02:00.405]  Panama, you know, Panama right now needs to expand.
[02:02:00.545 --> 02:02:04.666]  But no, why isn't America and China supporting this to be enlarged?
[02:02:05.226 --> 02:02:11.088]  Because they want these large Chinese ports off Mexico to bring it up the superhighway.
[02:02:11.168 --> 02:02:12.868]  And everybody's starting to wake up to this.
[02:02:13.328 --> 02:02:14.888]  You can ask the right of normal liberals.
[02:02:15.108 --> 02:02:15.969]  I hear you.
[02:02:16.049 --> 02:02:16.829]  I hear you.
[02:02:16.869 --> 02:02:17.469]  We got a break.
[02:02:17.509 --> 02:02:17.809]  Thank you.
[02:02:24.458 --> 02:02:27.660]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[02:02:28.020 --> 02:02:29.941]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[02:02:30.302 --> 02:02:37.966]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:02:38.647 --> 02:02:45.691]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:02:46.111 --> 02:02:49.013]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran.
[02:02:49.433 --> 02:02:51.754]  A White House program to disseminate fake news.
[02:02:52.175 --> 02:02:52.995]  NSA spies.
[02:02:53.547 --> 02:02:54.888]  Or by calling toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[02:02:54.908 --> 02:02:56.288]  Or watch it right now online at prisonplanet.tv.
[02:03:21.118 --> 02:03:29.360]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[02:03:29.620 --> 02:03:33.981]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[02:03:34.282 --> 02:03:43.184]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[02:03:43.404 --> 02:03:47.025]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[02:03:47.305 --> 02:03:52.333]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[02:03:52.633 --> 02:03:59.383]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[02:03:59.864 --> 02:04:00.405]  What about you?
[02:04:01.141 --> 02:04:06.505]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.
[02:04:06.545 --> 02:04:07.585]  Call now to order at 1-888-803-4438.
[02:04:07.726 --> 02:04:09.707]  Order today and save $14 by calling 1-888-803-4438.
[02:04:09.727 --> 02:04:14.830]  If you're looking at the world today from within the box, you must see total chaos and feel lost with no hope.
[02:04:30.296 --> 02:04:38.064]  Out-of-the-box thinkers, such as Nostradamus, who saw the world from a different perspective, knew that nature or God's truth would prevail.
[02:04:38.805 --> 02:04:48.074]  They saw that today's organized religions and governments are being judged, not with the hand of man through atomic wars, but with the hand of God through natural disasters.
[02:04:49.015 --> 02:04:52.499]  We are judging ourselves during this trying apocalyptic period.
[02:04:55.966 --> 02:04:58.108]  Don't you see this happening through the media today?
[02:04:58.508 --> 02:05:00.269]  Just remember these famous words.
[02:05:00.729 --> 02:05:04.251]  Everything hidden will be uncovered and the truth will make you free.
[02:05:05.232 --> 02:05:11.155]  For evidence of these statements, get Jerry Vano's new book, The Uncovering of the Greatest Story Never Told.
[02:05:11.475 --> 02:05:14.737]  Go to www.gvano.com.
[02:05:14.917 --> 02:05:17.278]  That's www.gvano.com.
[02:05:21.067 --> 02:05:26.131]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:05:26.492 --> 02:05:28.794]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:05:28.814 --> 02:05:43.386]  George Bush is a puppet, but what a puppet he is, to behold.
[02:05:43.406 --> 02:05:49.311]  They have that MIGS study done.
[02:05:50.666 --> 02:06:01.490]  Every four years of presidents comparing their IQs from their speeches, their writings, their public test scores, and George Bush has a 92 point IQ.
[02:06:01.550 --> 02:06:03.911]  George Bush Sr.
[02:06:03.931 --> 02:06:04.051]  has a 98.
[02:06:04.111 --> 02:06:06.472]  Bill Clinton has like a 182.
[02:06:06.712 --> 02:06:07.672]  Kennedy had a 174.
[02:06:07.812 --> 02:06:08.933]  I'm going from memory.
[02:06:08.953 --> 02:06:10.813]  I saw this this morning.
[02:06:19.489 --> 02:06:25.733]  And frankly, knowing and reading and seeing what I know about the different presidents, I think these IQ numbers are accurate.
[02:06:28.155 --> 02:06:30.076]  They've got Nixon with 155.
[02:06:30.116 --> 02:06:39.103]  And, of course, the neocons, I heard them this morning squealing, going, look, the liberals again are claiming George Bush isn't smart.
[02:06:40.343 --> 02:06:41.844]  No, I think Bush is smart.
[02:06:41.884 --> 02:06:44.166]  I mean, he's cunning like a rattlesnake.
[02:06:44.186 --> 02:06:48.369]  It doesn't mean Bill Clinton's good that the guy's a genius.
[02:06:49.238 --> 02:06:52.080]  I mean, I know people that know Bill Clinton personally, and let me tell you something.
[02:06:52.500 --> 02:06:56.603]  That guy can recite the Bill of Rights and Constitution in one read.
[02:06:57.003 --> 02:06:58.564]  The guy can recite whole bills.
[02:06:59.365 --> 02:07:13.074]  The guy would do the New York Times crossword while he was making foreign calls to dignitaries in his underwear while reading other files and other reports, and he would sleep about two hours a night until he finally blew his heart doing it.
[02:07:13.654 --> 02:07:14.955]  But, I mean, the guy is a genius.
[02:07:14.975 --> 02:07:16.396]  That's why the CIA recruited him.
[02:07:17.553 --> 02:07:24.137]  But it doesn't mean that you're an evil liberal because you know Bill Clinton's smarter than George W. Bush.
[02:07:24.177 --> 02:07:24.998]  It doesn't even matter.
[02:07:25.618 --> 02:07:35.524]  Bill Clinton used his evil smarts to kind of get the New World Order through a little bit slicker than Georgie Porgie Pudding Pie has been doing.
[02:07:35.544 --> 02:07:37.885]  That's one of the reports here in my stack.
[02:07:37.905 --> 02:07:44.789]  Look, I've been taking a lot of your calls, and we're going to go to Joe and Adam and George and Steve and Chris and
[02:07:46.055 --> 02:07:58.507]  Many others here in just a few minutes, but wiretapping the end of the Bill of Rights, violation of the Fourth Amendment, is not some partisan issue.
[02:08:01.370 --> 02:08:03.252]  And they tried to make it a partisan issue.
[02:08:07.696 --> 02:08:09.598]  Believe me, if Democrats were trying this,
[02:08:10.678 --> 02:08:12.340]  Republicans will be screaming bloody murder.
[02:08:12.640 --> 02:08:14.461]  And Republicans should ask themselves this.
[02:08:14.521 --> 02:08:15.863]  Democrats should ask themselves this.
[02:08:16.443 --> 02:08:23.069]  Democrats, when Hillary or whoever's in... I never thought it would be Hillary, and now there's things she's removing herself.
[02:08:23.129 --> 02:08:24.110]  I don't believe that for a minute.
[02:08:24.470 --> 02:08:26.472]  Now that she's saying she isn't going to run, she probably is.
[02:08:26.532 --> 02:08:29.914]  But that was convoluted, because their lies are convoluted.
[02:08:30.895 --> 02:08:32.657]  But the point I was trying to make here is...
[02:08:36.292 --> 02:08:39.695]  Democrats, why do you support things Democrats are doing when they're in office?
[02:08:39.995 --> 02:08:45.880]  And Republicans, why do you support things Republicans are doing when they're in office that you wouldn't support if the other party was doing it?
[02:08:45.920 --> 02:08:51.464]  You see, this just shows how they use the two-party system to switch off our thinking processes.
[02:08:54.367 --> 02:08:58.230]  And so Bush had the nerve to give this press conference last Friday that I did watch.
[02:09:00.774 --> 02:09:07.438]  Where he claimed that it's essential to keep us safe from Al-Qaeda that's sworn to kill us and their cold-blooded killers.
[02:09:08.559 --> 02:09:08.979]  You know what?
[02:09:09.039 --> 02:09:09.959]  Now's the time to do it.
[02:09:09.999 --> 02:09:12.041]  Let's go ahead and roll the Oberman piece.
[02:09:12.221 --> 02:09:12.781]  It's long.
[02:09:13.001 --> 02:09:13.782]  It's about eight minutes long.
[02:09:13.802 --> 02:09:14.682]  We'll play most of it.
[02:09:15.402 --> 02:09:22.186]  Oberman makes some good points, but mainly it's just Bush in this exchange, and he's just lying.
[02:09:23.387 --> 02:09:26.709]  And then the reporter keeps asking, well, what if other countries do this to our people?
[02:09:27.463 --> 02:09:29.829]  He goes, oh no, what we're doing now is a higher standard.
[02:09:30.109 --> 02:09:30.650]  No, it's not.
[02:09:30.670 --> 02:09:31.833]  It's saying torture is okay.
[02:09:31.853 --> 02:09:34.118]  You're just relabeling torture pressure.
[02:09:34.699 --> 02:09:35.301]  Go ahead and roll it.
[02:09:36.952 --> 02:09:41.813]  Good evening, this is Friday, September 15th, 53 days until the 2006 midterm elections.
[02:09:42.433 --> 02:09:49.735]  It's unacceptable to think, sounds like something straight out of George Orwell's 1984, instead it was something straight out of George Bush's mouth.
[02:09:50.135 --> 02:10:01.517]  Our fifth story on the countdown, that massive pre-election struggle Mr. Bush had engineered over national security having gone horribly wrong, not the Democrats defending now themselves against Republicans, but rather the President having to do so.
[02:10:01.877 --> 02:10:05.158]  And not only issuing those chilling words, it's unacceptable to think,
[02:10:05.718 --> 02:10:10.579]  But doing so in answer to the call to conscience from his own former Secretary of State Colin Powell.
[02:10:11.119 --> 02:10:21.162]  Having lost round one over his proposal for the interrogation of terror suspects with the Senate Armed Services Committee just yesterday, Mr. Bush subjecting himself to an interrogation today at the White House Rose Garden.
[02:10:21.522 --> 02:10:26.643]  In the course of the news conference, the President pretty much playing chicken with Congress, threatening to abandon all U.S.
[02:10:26.703 --> 02:10:32.345]  efforts to question terror suspects unless the Senate sees fit to rewrite Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions.
[02:10:33.046 --> 02:10:36.290]  The part that prohibits the cruel and inhuman treatment of detainees.
[02:10:36.630 --> 02:10:42.118]  Mr. Bush also rebuking his former Secretary of State for not believing exactly what he wants him to believe.
[02:10:43.795 --> 02:10:51.139]  Mr. President, former Secretary of State Colin Powell says the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism.
[02:10:51.779 --> 02:11:02.545]  If a former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and former Secretary of State feels this way, don't you think that Americans and the rest of the world are beginning to wonder whether you're following a flawed strategy?
[02:11:05.227 --> 02:11:10.650]  If there's any comparison between the compassion and decency of the American people
[02:11:12.637 --> 02:11:17.461]  And the terrorist tactics of extremists, it's flawed logic.
[02:11:19.062 --> 02:11:20.223]  I simply can't accept that.
[02:11:20.283 --> 02:11:35.674]  It's unacceptable to think that there's any kind of comparison between the behavior of the United States of America and the action of Islamic extremists who kill innocent women and children to achieve an objective.
[02:11:36.394 --> 02:11:38.636]  Dave, he's back.
[02:11:39.794 --> 02:11:42.915]  Mr. President, critics of your proposed bill on interrogation rules say there's another important test.
[02:11:43.095 --> 02:11:50.317]  These critics include John McCain, who you've mentioned several times this morning.
[02:11:50.357 --> 02:11:51.518]  And that test is this.
[02:12:09.429 --> 02:12:32.115]  If a CIA officer, paramilitary, or special operations soldier from the United States were captured in Iran or North Korea and they were roughed up and those governments said, well, they were interrogated in accordance with our interpretation of the Geneva Conventions and then they were put on trial and they were convicted based on secret evidence that they were not able to see
[02:12:33.209 --> 02:12:36.191]  How would you react to that as Commander-in-Chief?
[02:12:37.071 --> 02:12:47.957]  David, my reaction is that if the nations, such as those you named, adopted the standards within the Detainee Detention Act, the world would be better.
[02:12:48.197 --> 02:12:48.998]  That's my reaction.
[02:12:49.438 --> 02:12:50.739]  We're trying to clarify law.
[02:12:51.799 --> 02:12:54.621]  We're trying to set high standards, not ambiguous standards.
[02:12:55.141 --> 02:12:57.162]  And let me just repeat, Dave.
[02:12:58.863 --> 02:13:01.665]  We can debate this issue all we want, but the practical matter is...
[02:13:02.603 --> 02:13:08.868]  If our professionals don't have clear standards in the law, the program is not going to go forward.
[02:13:09.889 --> 02:13:16.094]  You cannot ask a young intelligence officer to violate the law, and they're not going to.
[02:13:19.036 --> 02:13:21.097]  They will not violate the law.
[02:13:23.780 --> 02:13:30.605]  You can ask this question all you want, but the bottom line is, and the American people have got to understand this, that
[02:13:31.647 --> 02:13:32.967]  This program won't go forward.
[02:13:35.868 --> 02:13:44.271]  If there's vague standards applied, like those in Common Article 3 from the Geneva Convention, this is not going to go forward.
[02:13:45.652 --> 02:13:48.013]  Now, perhaps some in Congress don't think the program is important.
[02:13:48.633 --> 02:13:49.053]  That's fine.
[02:13:49.193 --> 02:13:50.453]  I don't know if they do or don't.
[02:13:50.974 --> 02:13:57.456]  I think it's vital, and I have the obligation to make sure that our professionals, who I would ask to go,
[02:13:58.562 --> 02:14:03.973]  Conduct interrogations to find out what might be happening or who might be coming to this country.
[02:14:04.133 --> 02:14:06.137]  I've got to give them the tools they need, and that is clear law.
[02:14:08.028 --> 02:14:11.689]  This is an important point, and I think... The point I just made is the most important point.
[02:14:11.789 --> 02:14:12.069]  Okay.
[02:14:12.229 --> 02:14:14.390]  And that is the program is not going forward.
[02:14:14.730 --> 02:14:18.471]  David, you can give a hypothetical about North Korea or any other country.
[02:14:18.911 --> 02:14:31.415]  The point is that the program is not going to go forward if our professionals do not have clarity in the law, and the best way to provide clarity in the law is to make sure the Detainee Treatment Act is the crux of the law.
[02:14:31.435 --> 02:14:31.635]  Okay.
[02:14:31.655 --> 02:14:33.376]  That's how we define Common Article 3.
[02:14:33.436 --> 02:14:34.696]  All right, hit pause there.
[02:14:34.716 --> 02:14:36.777]  We'll play more of it later, and I've got a bunch of other clips, but...
[02:14:37.643 --> 02:14:41.265]  Again, when your Facebook lies this monumentally, my mouth just hangs open.
[02:14:41.285 --> 02:14:42.326]  Where do I even start?
[02:14:43.067 --> 02:14:45.848]  We have multiple declassified Army reports.
[02:14:46.329 --> 02:14:48.350]  We have people who have been convicted and pled guilty.
[02:14:48.390 --> 02:14:51.092]  We have the White House memos from Gonzalez and you.
[02:14:51.572 --> 02:14:57.416]  We have Bush on the record stating that he is for, quote, tough interrogations.
[02:14:58.437 --> 02:14:59.137]  And what are they?
[02:15:00.278 --> 02:15:02.179]  It's taking people and beating them to death.
[02:15:02.299 --> 02:15:05.301]  It's putting them on tables, strapping them down, and dunking them in water.
[02:15:06.124 --> 02:15:09.525]  Until you drowned over and over again and pulling you back up and resuscitating you.
[02:15:10.946 --> 02:15:16.248]  It's hooking people up on respirators with drugs and stopping their hearts and turning their hearts back on and off again.
[02:15:16.268 --> 02:15:18.129]  I mean, this is Dr. Mingle stuff.
[02:15:18.889 --> 02:15:22.531]  And yes, ladies and gentlemen, it's raping children.
[02:15:23.531 --> 02:15:25.212]  And somebody's got to talk about this.
[02:15:27.393 --> 02:15:29.954]  Folks who hear me talk about this issue have trouble believing it.
[02:15:31.113 --> 02:15:32.915]  I have trouble believing it, too, okay?
[02:15:33.015 --> 02:15:35.056]  It's in a bunch of mainstream news articles.
[02:15:35.156 --> 02:15:36.197]  It's in Terror Storm.
[02:15:36.998 --> 02:15:39.400]  We flash a bunch of mainstream news articles on the screen.
[02:15:39.420 --> 02:15:45.324]  And it came out in the Tugumbu Report, the Army's report.
[02:15:45.425 --> 02:15:47.566]  It came out just all over the place.
[02:15:47.926 --> 02:15:54.652]  And then this caller calls into the show I was on yesterday and says, Where does it say they can rape children?
[02:15:55.640 --> 02:16:03.187]  And I said, what it says is they can do whatever they want, including sexually torturing children.
[02:16:03.287 --> 02:16:06.711]  And amongst all the things that have been done, children have been raped.
[02:16:08.372 --> 02:16:09.734]  And that's all been admitted.
[02:16:11.515 --> 02:16:16.100]  And anybody with a computer and a search engine can go find the mainstream news.
[02:16:17.435 --> 02:16:27.498]  I mean, back when they thought they were living high on the hog after the globalist stage 9-11, I remember in early 2002, it had to be January, the article's in Road to Tyranny.
[02:16:27.518 --> 02:16:29.498]  It's a Washington Post article.
[02:16:30.819 --> 02:16:39.501]  And it was the CIA section chief goes, oh yeah, we take people to third-party countries to torture them, and we also, quote, pressure their family members, including children.
[02:16:40.241 --> 02:16:41.161]  By the way, that's a quote.
[02:16:43.182 --> 02:16:43.662]  We also...
[02:16:44.784 --> 02:16:46.985]  Pressure family members, including their children.
[02:16:47.025 --> 02:16:50.005]  When people go find that, they go, Oh, oh, see?
[02:16:50.025 --> 02:16:50.085]  See?
[02:16:50.746 --> 02:16:51.786]  You said torture.
[02:16:51.866 --> 02:16:52.886]  This says pressure.
[02:16:53.126 --> 02:16:55.747]  Hey, their new word for torture is pressure.
[02:16:57.387 --> 02:17:06.389]  See, there's any... You can go read the Washington Post with them bragging that they quote pressure children in front of their parents, and by the time you're done with it, well, Alex, you've been proven to be a liar.
[02:17:06.410 --> 02:17:08.110]  He doesn't say torture there.
[02:17:09.304 --> 02:17:13.347]  Then you go put that report together with the other admissions of raping them in front of their parents.
[02:17:13.608 --> 02:17:14.608]  That's the kind of torture.
[02:17:15.489 --> 02:17:17.811]  That acid.
[02:17:17.891 --> 02:17:19.432]  I can't even say anything with the acid.
[02:17:19.512 --> 02:17:20.093]  I just, you know.
[02:17:21.471 --> 02:17:26.753]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones introducing you to the incredible Berkey Solar Charger.
[02:17:26.973 --> 02:17:29.034]  Your source for free solar electricity.
[02:17:29.274 --> 02:17:36.396]  This portable system is the size of a book when folded and small enough to fit into a briefcase, handbag, or glove compartment.
[02:17:36.536 --> 02:17:48.040]  The Berkey Solar Charger has been designed to power the Berkey lights, LED lamps, as well as other applications such as mobile phones, radios, digital cameras, and PDAs when electricity is unavailable.
[02:17:48.440 --> 02:17:55.803]  It's multi-voltage capabilities, multiple adapters, and rechargeable batteries provide for flexible source of auxiliary backup power.
[02:17:56.103 --> 02:18:01.066]  Simply place the Berkey Solar Charger in the sun, plug in your application, and you have power.
[02:18:01.226 --> 02:18:06.208]  This connector application, the system automatically begins charging its own rechargeable batteries.
[02:18:06.508 --> 02:18:11.890]  Get the incredible Berkey Solar Charger for only $75 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:18:11.910 --> 02:18:13.131]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[02:18:13.211 --> 02:18:14.191]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[02:18:14.211 --> 02:18:15.471]  Currency, devaluation, inflation.
[02:18:15.512 --> 02:18:16.152]  One and the same.
[02:18:16.272 --> 02:18:18.953]  If you had deposited $100,000 in a bank at 1%,
[02:18:35.430 --> 02:18:40.892]  In a 30-month period dating from May 24, 2005, here is what happened to your funds.
[02:18:41.332 --> 02:18:44.433]  The dollar lost 33% of its value in that time frame.
[02:18:44.713 --> 02:18:46.554]  The bank paid you 1%.
[02:18:46.794 --> 02:18:49.635]  Your $100,000 now has a net purchasing power of $68,000.
[02:18:50.175 --> 02:18:52.396]  Here is reality.
[02:18:52.756 --> 02:18:56.337]  The devaluation of currency equals real inflation.
[02:18:56.817 --> 02:19:00.498]  Keep in mind how the value of your paper assets are measured in dollars.
[02:19:01.059 --> 02:19:03.520]  Gold, in the same time frame, increased 35% in value.
[02:19:05.225 --> 02:19:05.485]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:19:21.238 --> 02:19:23.599]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:19:23.700 --> 02:19:34.166]  Did you know that President Kennedy signed into law State Department Publication 7277 entitled The United States Program for Complete and General Disarmament in a Peaceful World?
[02:19:34.246 --> 02:19:39.449]  This would disarm America and turn all of our armed forces over to the United Nations organization.
[02:19:40.189 --> 02:19:44.632]  Citizens would be required to turn in their guns guaranteed to them by the Second Amendment.
[02:19:45.319 --> 02:19:51.024]  The head of the United Nations forces that would control all arms would always be a communist by agreement.
[02:19:51.784 --> 02:19:59.791]  We'd like to help you understand how these things are coming to pass by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[02:20:22.197 --> 02:20:23.899]  Hello, this is Amy Bjorklund.
[02:20:24.079 --> 02:20:26.682]  Are you totally satisfied with the nourishment you're getting?
[02:20:26.802 --> 02:20:29.785]  Do you have enough energy to do everything you really want to do?
[02:20:30.045 --> 02:20:33.509]  And are you content to remain in your current state of health indefinitely?
[02:20:33.789 --> 02:20:39.615]  Have you already tried diets, exercise, vitamins, juicing, or the latest, greatest nutritional wonder products?
[02:20:39.955 --> 02:20:44.736]  Perhaps those things have grown tiresome and not made you feel and look as well as you'd really like to.
[02:20:44.996 --> 02:20:55.379]  But what if you found from a single source the world's freshest, purest, most complete, whole, live food nourishment that tastes delicious and couldn't be any easier to consume?
[02:20:55.659 --> 02:20:56.940]  Well, you just did.
[02:20:57.300 --> 02:20:58.280]  So don't hesitate.
[02:20:58.380 --> 02:21:02.421]  Take the living energy you've always wanted from your nutrition right now.
[02:21:02.701 --> 02:21:08.123]  Visit truthinexcellence.com, click the Truth in Excellence banner on GCNlive.com,
[02:21:08.963 --> 02:21:11.944]  Or call me, Amy Bjorkman, personally at 805-595-2711.
[02:21:11.964 --> 02:21:12.004]  805-595-2711.
[02:21:37.910 --> 02:21:43.471]  Remember, first they claimed that they were just going to torture people because they were Al-Qaeda and they deserved it.
[02:21:44.272 --> 02:21:49.193]  Then when the photos started coming out, they claimed that it wasn't torture or that it was lone people that were doing it.
[02:21:50.593 --> 02:21:57.335]  Then their own memos came out where they were ordering it, going, well, if we change it from torture to pressure, that makes it okay.
[02:22:00.056 --> 02:22:04.357]  And so if you want to get technical, these White House admissions say that
[02:22:05.046 --> 02:22:08.770]  They can pressure children with pliers.
[02:22:09.971 --> 02:22:22.762]  Now, if you don't think crushing children's body parts with pliers in front of their parents is torture, how about you volunteer to let me beat your head in with a baseball bat and we won't call it assault and battery?
[02:22:23.863 --> 02:22:30.750]  Or, I mean, just how about you stick your arm in a garbage disposal or take a ball-peen hammer and just slam it down your hand as hard as you can?
[02:22:31.457 --> 02:22:35.278]  Because, I mean, that's all the New World Order can give you is semantical lies.
[02:22:36.139 --> 02:22:36.819]  That's all they do.
[02:22:36.879 --> 02:22:37.339]  They lie.
[02:22:37.980 --> 02:22:39.340]  They twist word meanings.
[02:22:39.780 --> 02:22:41.401]  They treat us like we're a bunch of idiots.
[02:22:41.461 --> 02:22:42.081]  It's like Bush.
[02:22:42.161 --> 02:22:43.462]  I heard needle boards this morning.
[02:22:45.803 --> 02:22:51.685]  What a puffed up sack of... I'm not even going to say it.
[02:22:53.505 --> 02:22:55.426]  Well, now you think I was going to say a cuss word, and I wasn't.
[02:22:55.486 --> 02:22:57.087]  A sack of maggot pus.
[02:22:57.187 --> 02:22:57.847]  Okay, there you go.
[02:22:57.867 --> 02:22:59.988]  I feel like a five-year-old now, but I mean...
[02:23:01.511 --> 02:23:04.813]  Just this into power, into money, into his status.
[02:23:04.893 --> 02:23:05.553]  I've met the guy.
[02:23:06.513 --> 02:23:07.414]  Been around him twice.
[02:23:09.955 --> 02:23:10.855]  No, I guess three times.
[02:23:10.875 --> 02:23:11.496]  That's not true.
[02:23:14.617 --> 02:23:17.539]  The same every single time.
[02:23:19.620 --> 02:23:20.440]  He doesn't care.
[02:23:20.520 --> 02:23:21.380]  He's not stupid.
[02:23:21.420 --> 02:23:22.201]  He's a lawyer.
[02:23:22.821 --> 02:23:24.702]  Guaranteed, he knows all about the New World Order.
[02:23:24.722 --> 02:23:26.343]  He knows all about what's happening in this country.
[02:23:26.763 --> 02:23:28.944]  And these guys just cynically decide to go along with it.
[02:23:30.740 --> 02:23:31.881]  That is so sick.
[02:23:32.681 --> 02:23:33.902]  But anyway, side issue.
[02:23:35.383 --> 02:23:45.130]  I'm listening to him this morning, and he's playing a game with dumb callers going, Show me one example where George W. Bush has lied.
[02:23:45.850 --> 02:23:48.152]  Ah, you can't show me one example.
[02:23:49.833 --> 02:23:53.735]  And I only listened to about 20 minutes in the car, and this idiot after idiot was calling in.
[02:23:53.755 --> 02:23:55.216]  You're average liberal.
[02:23:55.597 --> 02:23:56.417]  They're for gun control.
[02:23:56.437 --> 02:23:56.937]  What do you expect?
[02:23:56.957 --> 02:23:57.738]  They're not going to know anything.
[02:23:58.733 --> 02:24:03.915]  And, you know, they're calling him going, well, he lied about WMDs.
[02:24:04.276 --> 02:24:06.357]  Well, no, that was just false intelligence.
[02:24:06.397 --> 02:24:08.217]  And the caller's like, oh, really?
[02:24:09.378 --> 02:24:12.759]  Instead of going, no, the White House memo clearly shows he premeditatedly lied.
[02:24:13.000 --> 02:24:14.480]  And then Bortz would say, what's your source?
[02:24:14.520 --> 02:24:15.921]  Times of London, Associated Press.
[02:24:16.704 --> 02:24:17.685]  Oh, what's the date on that?
[02:24:17.725 --> 02:24:19.446]  Well, Neil, type it into Google and look it up.
[02:24:19.666 --> 02:24:20.987]  Because they'll try that lawyer tactic.
[02:24:21.147 --> 02:24:21.828]  Oh yeah, oh yeah.
[02:24:22.128 --> 02:24:24.089]  But a few callers did call in who knew what they were doing.
[02:24:24.109 --> 02:24:29.893]  They said, well, Bush lied and said he'd never heard of a plan of planes to fly planes into buildings.
[02:24:31.555 --> 02:24:37.499]  But it's now come out that two weeks before they had the specific memo with the plans and they knew all about it, they were running drills.
[02:24:39.162 --> 02:24:41.503]  And Borch just goes, Oh, sure, I bet.
[02:24:41.623 --> 02:24:42.003]  Uh-huh.
[02:24:42.364 --> 02:24:43.524]  I bet it's true.
[02:24:43.644 --> 02:24:44.405]  I bet.
[02:24:45.005 --> 02:24:45.465]  Uh-huh.
[02:24:45.545 --> 02:24:46.506]  Thanks a lot.
[02:24:46.546 --> 02:24:48.167]  You know, you conspiracy theorist.
[02:24:48.867 --> 02:24:49.207]  Click.
[02:24:50.528 --> 02:24:51.428]  And that's their answer.
[02:24:52.169 --> 02:24:53.869]  But I'll give you a whole bunch of Bush lies.
[02:24:53.889 --> 02:24:54.630]  Would you like me to?
[02:24:56.291 --> 02:24:59.132]  I wish I had time to sit around and just write articles about stuff like this.
[02:25:00.673 --> 02:25:04.635]  Bush says that his amnesty plan is not amnesty.
[02:25:04.675 --> 02:25:06.936]  His guest worker program is not an amnesty.
[02:25:07.680 --> 02:25:11.562]  If you read the legislation, both his version and the Democratic version, they're both just as bad.
[02:25:12.102 --> 02:25:15.103]  It is total blanket amnesty for six years, whoever's in the country.
[02:25:15.603 --> 02:25:18.965]  Total blanket amnesty for whoever wants to come to the country or could ever get here.
[02:25:19.265 --> 02:25:22.546]  It allows corporations to bring in unlimited skilled and unskilled.
[02:25:25.027 --> 02:25:25.728]  On and on and on.
[02:25:26.848 --> 02:25:29.329]  Instantly gives them ID cards to legalize them.
[02:25:29.789 --> 02:25:31.450]  Instantly lets them bring their families here.
[02:25:34.028 --> 02:25:49.037]  And there was even a provision they made him tack on about felons, but the felon can get a waiver form, which is then issued by the immigrant community groups that get the government grants and funds to run all the different immigrant certification arms.
[02:25:49.057 --> 02:25:54.260]  Okay, there's a big lie right there.
[02:25:57.382 --> 02:26:03.386]  And there are so many lies that
[02:26:04.165 --> 02:26:06.607]  Bush has told.
[02:26:06.667 --> 02:26:12.851]  I mean, I've got video clips of him saying, now don't worry, with these wiretaps, we've got to have warrants under the Patriot Act.
[02:26:12.871 --> 02:26:14.011]  We've still got to have warrants.
[02:26:14.972 --> 02:26:18.434]  Meanwhile, you know, they've got millions of instances without a warrant spying.
[02:26:20.195 --> 02:26:22.217]  And he's up there saying, we don't spy on you.
[02:26:23.938 --> 02:26:25.479]  We don't spy on you without warrants.
[02:26:26.405 --> 02:26:30.228]  Then he lies again and says, oh, this is just for Al-Qaeda calls to the U.S.
[02:26:30.248 --> 02:26:32.990]  And then, of course, it comes out that they're basically listening to everything.
[02:26:33.010 --> 02:26:36.593]  And then they spin it, well, we've got to track it to make sure.
[02:26:39.276 --> 02:26:43.179]  Here's another lie, claiming that I've appointed this independent commission.
[02:26:43.279 --> 02:26:45.521]  I've appointed this independent commission.
[02:26:45.541 --> 02:26:46.501]  Okay, it's independent.
[02:26:46.521 --> 02:26:47.042]  He appointed it.
[02:26:49.605 --> 02:26:51.286]  I mean, I can't even do justice to the lies.
[02:26:51.306 --> 02:26:52.566]  I sit here and just think about them.
[02:26:52.666 --> 02:26:56.068]  I'm like, God, which one do I... And again, Bush is a puppet himself.
[02:26:56.108 --> 02:26:57.228]  I hate to build the guy up.
[02:26:59.609 --> 02:27:08.072]  You know, something else the neocons do on the radio is show me one example of how the Patriot Act's been used to violate a citizen's right.
[02:27:08.092 --> 02:27:09.733]  I'll show you thousands.
[02:27:11.573 --> 02:27:12.474]  We're on the march.
[02:27:12.954 --> 02:27:14.555]  The empire's on the run.
[02:27:15.475 --> 02:27:18.176]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:23.686 --> 02:27:24.066]  We're good to go.
[02:27:44.957 --> 02:27:45.557]  We're good to go.
[02:28:07.629 --> 02:28:08.009]  That's 1-866-885-6625.
[02:28:08.030 --> 02:28:08.090]  1-866-885-6625.
[02:28:21.986 --> 02:28:22.666]  Hello, folks.

[02:29:10.103 --> 02:29:12.124]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network.
[02:29:12.144 --> 02:29:14.104]  I have an urgent message for all of our listeners.
[02:29:14.124 --> 02:29:17.685]  The mass media keeps telling us that we are the richest, most powerful economy in the world.
[02:29:17.785 --> 02:29:22.226]  If this is true, why can't we pay our bills?
[02:29:37.705 --> 02:29:41.248]  Why is the United States the world's largest debtor nation?
[02:29:41.808 --> 02:29:45.952]  The truth is that we are in the worst debt bubble in our nation's history.
[02:29:46.512 --> 02:29:49.514]  When the bubble bursts, will you be able to feed your family?
[02:29:50.475 --> 02:29:53.397]  When the inevitable crash occurs, will you be ready?
[02:29:54.118 --> 02:29:56.580]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.
[02:29:56.620 --> 02:29:58.661]  That's 1-888-892-6238 for the following two free reports.
[02:30:07.734 --> 02:30:08.014]  U.S.
[02:30:08.114 --> 02:30:10.997]  debt bubble, red alert, and real estate crash.
[02:30:11.997 --> 02:30:19.863]  Call 888-8XANADU, that's 888-8XANADU, and ask for George.
[02:30:22.525 --> 02:30:27.669]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:30:28.329 --> 02:30:30.631]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:30:35.891 --> 02:30:37.312]  I want to go ahead and get this out of the way.
[02:30:37.332 --> 02:30:39.874]  I sound out of the weather today.
[02:30:39.934 --> 02:30:40.655]  It was a rough cold.
[02:30:40.735 --> 02:30:42.356]  I've had like four plus days now.
[02:30:43.477 --> 02:30:45.398]  But the fever finally went away this morning.
[02:30:45.959 --> 02:30:47.620]  But yesterday I really was brain dead.
[02:30:47.660 --> 02:30:52.263]  But I still went in and did the KLBJ show that we're syndicating through Genesis Communications.
[02:30:53.484 --> 02:30:54.705]  Coming up here in the next few weeks.
[02:30:56.286 --> 02:30:57.827]  I wasn't there last week.
[02:30:57.948 --> 02:30:59.689]  I was in New York, so I thought, well, I better be there today.
[02:31:01.284 --> 02:31:16.989]  And I'm walking down the hall, totally brain-dead to get a glass of water during a break, and it's a big building, and by the water cooler they've got 101X, kind of a progressive music station on progressive rock, whatever you want to call it.
[02:31:19.049 --> 02:31:23.251]  And I hear 9-11, and I go, is that Muse?
[02:31:23.291 --> 02:31:27.172]  Because I knew Muse, which is in the top ten of the charts here in the U.S.
[02:31:27.232 --> 02:31:27.712]  and in England.
[02:31:28.314 --> 02:31:32.475]  I knew they were going to be here for the big Boston Music Fest they have.
[02:31:33.155 --> 02:31:34.615]  Hundreds of thousands of people out there.
[02:31:35.335 --> 02:31:37.036]  Willie Nelson, Tom Petty, all of it.
[02:31:38.356 --> 02:31:43.417]  And so I run into the board operator, the producer of the show.
[02:31:43.437 --> 02:31:44.297]  He does all the jobs.
[02:31:45.377 --> 02:31:45.777]  Trey.
[02:31:46.357 --> 02:31:49.058]  And I go, call 101X, which is just next door.
[02:31:49.078 --> 02:31:50.018]  It's a few doors down.
[02:31:50.538 --> 02:31:56.279]  And get the head guy from Muse on here.
[02:31:57.262 --> 02:32:02.267]  Well, like 30 seconds later, he's already called, got them lined up and on.
[02:32:02.287 --> 02:32:03.368]  I don't know how he did it so fast.
[02:32:04.029 --> 02:32:05.471]  And Muse was confused, too.
[02:32:05.691 --> 02:32:06.852]  He knew he was on 101X.
[02:32:06.892 --> 02:32:08.173]  He didn't even know I had a show at the time.
[02:32:08.193 --> 02:32:09.835]  It probably sounded like it was set up.
[02:32:09.895 --> 02:32:10.816]  I've got his number and email.
[02:32:10.836 --> 02:32:14.480]  I'm going to contact him today and try to get him on for a proper interview.
[02:32:16.102 --> 02:32:19.225]  But here he is being interviewed by 101X, and then a minute later, you'll hear...
[02:32:20.765 --> 02:32:22.986]  The lead singer getting interviewed by myself.
[02:32:23.146 --> 02:32:27.507]  And again, I have to tell you, I wasn't well because it's embarrassing how I was interviewing him.
[02:32:27.567 --> 02:32:32.249]  I mean, I just literally, you know, when you're sick, your brain does not work.
[02:32:32.289 --> 02:32:33.129]  At least mine doesn't.
[02:32:33.169 --> 02:32:36.230]  And I sounded somewhat oafish.
[02:32:36.810 --> 02:32:37.990]  But here it is, folks.
[02:32:38.010 --> 02:32:43.532]  101 Eggs, broadcasting live, Austin City Limits Music Festival, going down to 2006.
[02:32:43.632 --> 02:32:45.013]  Oh, my God.
[02:32:45.133 --> 02:32:46.213]  Is it 2006 already?
[02:32:46.853 --> 02:32:47.233]  Good.
[02:32:47.553 --> 02:32:47.753]  Good.
[02:32:47.814 --> 02:32:49.074]  I can't wait until it's over.
[02:32:49.571 --> 02:32:52.572]  When's the world going to blow up, Muse?
[02:32:52.732 --> 02:32:53.412]  2012, isn't it?
[02:32:53.432 --> 02:32:53.892]  2012, is that it?
[02:32:53.932 --> 02:32:54.452]  Yeah, we're on.
[02:32:54.472 --> 02:32:56.953]  I'm talking to Matt and Dominic from the band.
[02:32:56.993 --> 02:32:58.014]  How's it going?
[02:32:58.054 --> 02:32:59.834]  Take those headphones off, Ben, if you can.
[02:32:59.854 --> 02:33:00.654]  That's okay.
[02:33:01.034 --> 02:33:01.835]  I'll try to cut it.
[02:33:02.295 --> 02:33:02.675]  It's good.
[02:33:02.735 --> 02:33:03.635]  How are you guys doing?
[02:33:03.675 --> 02:33:04.335]  Yeah, great, great.
[02:33:04.355 --> 02:33:04.876]  You know what?
[02:33:04.896 --> 02:33:05.676]  Stop it right there.
[02:33:06.296 --> 02:33:07.556]  That's actually a long interview.
[02:33:07.576 --> 02:33:09.617]  I'd ask them to cut the front off.
[02:33:09.637 --> 02:33:10.197]  They didn't do it.
[02:33:10.217 --> 02:33:11.037]  We just won't play it.
[02:33:11.578 --> 02:33:12.658]  Go ahead and go to the next one.
[02:33:12.678 --> 02:33:14.178]  Do you have the part where I'm interviewing them?
[02:33:15.639 --> 02:33:16.319]  Go ahead and roll that.
[02:33:18.194 --> 02:33:19.154]  Yeah, hi Alex, how you doing?
[02:33:19.594 --> 02:33:21.695]  Hey sir, I've really been wanting to get a hold of you guys.
[02:33:21.715 --> 02:33:22.695]  Thanks for talking to us.
[02:33:23.315 --> 02:33:24.375]  Yeah, thanks for having me.
[02:33:24.475 --> 02:33:25.856]  It's great to talk to you.
[02:33:25.876 --> 02:33:27.316]  Big fan of your work and what you're doing.
[02:33:27.816 --> 02:33:33.298]  Well listen, I mean, I'm here doing a Sunday show that we just started that we're about to syndicate nationally.
[02:33:33.718 --> 02:33:39.219]  I'm in the break room listening to another radio station out of the same building, and I hear you on the air, so I salute you.
[02:33:39.519 --> 02:33:44.940]  Thank you for all your help and your bold, courageous stance in exposing 9-11 and 7-7.
[02:33:45.280 --> 02:33:47.841]  You really helped us reach millions of young people.
[02:33:48.516 --> 02:33:54.197]  Yeah, well, I think it's an important time to bring the truth out, you know, and I think it's very hard for people to face up to these facts.
[02:33:54.217 --> 02:33:57.078]  Some of these things are just too blatant to ignore.
[02:33:57.098 --> 02:34:00.279]  I mean, it's something that I kind of came across through the internet and discovering.
[02:34:00.499 --> 02:34:04.620]  I actually heard about you through listening to Coast to Coast with George Norrie.
[02:34:05.080 --> 02:34:08.401]  I heard you getting interviewed on there, and that's where I first came across you and your work.
[02:34:08.881 --> 02:34:17.263]  And then I went on to Google Video and watched some of your films, like Terror Storm, and it really kind of opened my eyes to things which I kind of felt, you know, I kind of had like an instinct in me to kind of
[02:34:17.748 --> 02:34:18.048]  Well, I agree.
[02:34:18.068 --> 02:34:18.949]  Give us your take on 9-11 and 7-7.
[02:34:19.069 --> 02:34:22.452]  I've always had a personal interest in this because my uncle was actually killed by the IRA.
[02:34:46.810 --> 02:34:48.491]  My dad's brother, that is.
[02:34:48.611 --> 02:34:49.311]  I didn't know that.
[02:34:49.391 --> 02:35:03.074]  And that was something that kind of, for all my life, I've always kind of looked at terrorist acts and kind of looked at them from two different angles and thought, well, you know, is this the real thing or are we being manipulated to believe to sort of devalue a certain organization's cause?
[02:35:03.114 --> 02:35:09.195]  And I kind of, so really, I think I kind of agree with you on the September 11th.
[02:35:09.375 --> 02:35:13.816]  It's definitely, you know, whether or not it's completely made to happen or whether it's allowed to happen, I'm not quite sure.
[02:35:14.967 --> 02:35:20.893]  As to which of those two it is, but I think there's definitely a lot of evidence, a lot of questions that need to be asked, questions that need to be answered.
[02:35:21.254 --> 02:35:21.674]  Well, I agree.
[02:35:21.714 --> 02:35:31.185]  What do you think of Hugo Chavez, who, you know, try as they might to demonize him, he's basically giving free heating oil to the American people and helping his people.
[02:35:31.465 --> 02:35:32.547]  He came out now...
[02:35:33.047 --> 02:35:34.547]  And I know he's seen my documentaries.
[02:35:34.607 --> 02:35:36.328]  I've talked to people that have delivered them to him.
[02:35:36.588 --> 02:35:42.229]  He's coming out and saying, look, controlled demolition, the evidences, the military-industrial complex stood to gain from this.
[02:35:42.529 --> 02:35:44.129]  He said it needs to be investigated.
[02:35:44.489 --> 02:35:47.410]  Why do you think they're struggling so hard to not let it be investigated?
[02:35:48.290 --> 02:35:56.751]  Well, I mean, it's clearly, it's clearly, I mean, my type of view is it's not necessarily the people that we think are our leaders, you know, your George Bushes and the Tony Blais.
[02:35:56.811 --> 02:35:58.131]  Oh, yeah, they're puppets.
[02:35:58.391 --> 02:36:00.492]  I think there's a group of people behind these people.
[02:36:00.552 --> 02:36:01.612]  I think we're talking about a
[02:36:02.262 --> 02:36:03.643]  We're good to go.
[02:36:18.635 --> 02:36:23.457]  They've been allowed to run free with a lot of our money, and it's getting out of control.
[02:36:23.477 --> 02:36:25.238]  We need to be reined in.
[02:36:25.338 --> 02:36:25.798]  Absolutely.
[02:36:25.818 --> 02:36:31.121]  We're talking to the lead singer, Matt Bellamy of Muse, one of the lead acts at ACL.
[02:36:31.321 --> 02:36:33.022]  What do you think of the Texas heat out there?
[02:36:33.722 --> 02:36:34.443]  It's immense.
[02:36:34.503 --> 02:36:35.543]  It's nice to be back here, though.
[02:36:35.583 --> 02:36:38.545]  It's our second concert, and often we're here at the festival.
[02:36:38.605 --> 02:36:40.205]  I love playing festivals.
[02:36:40.265 --> 02:36:44.367]  It's always a great mixed crowd out there, and you get a chance to see acts you wouldn't normally play with.
[02:36:44.427 --> 02:36:45.508]  It's a lovely day.
[02:36:46.394 --> 02:36:50.958]  Well, listen, I mean, it was just wonderful walking through the hallways and hearing your voice.
[02:36:52.159 --> 02:37:04.509]  And before we let you go, I'd like to get your contact info, because I tried like the devil to try to get your contact info once you had been gracious enough on national BBC television to plug Terror Storm.
[02:37:05.410 --> 02:37:06.011]  Yeah.
[02:37:06.351 --> 02:37:09.435]  If you'd like... I can give you that.
[02:37:09.495 --> 02:37:11.397]  Is this a private phone call, or is this on air?
[02:37:11.457 --> 02:37:11.877]  Oh, no, no.
[02:37:11.898 --> 02:37:12.758]  We're on air right now.
[02:37:12.778 --> 02:37:13.399]  That's what I'm saying.
[02:37:13.419 --> 02:37:16.503]  I'll put you on hold before you leave us, and we can get that info.
[02:37:16.986 --> 02:37:20.007]  Yeah, I'll give you my contact information off here if you don't mind.
[02:37:20.027 --> 02:37:20.627]  Fantastic.
[02:37:20.667 --> 02:37:22.128]  I'm glad I drug my butt in here.
[02:37:22.148 --> 02:37:26.950]  You know, I had a cold, but I said I want to come in and do this Sunday show, and sure enough, I end up talking to you.
[02:37:27.630 --> 02:37:33.912]  What do you think about the reports of the establishment wanting to go to war with Iran?
[02:37:33.932 --> 02:37:36.873]  I mean, right now we've got the American people against it.
[02:37:36.893 --> 02:37:38.274]  We've got the British people against it.
[02:37:38.314 --> 02:37:39.974]  We've got the Iranian people don't want it.
[02:37:40.254 --> 02:37:42.175]  But why do you think the establishment wants war?
[02:37:43.499 --> 02:37:46.400]  Well, I mean, obviously war is a big money-making industry.
[02:37:46.841 --> 02:37:49.562]  You know, obviously in America it's a very big money-making industry.
[02:37:49.602 --> 02:38:00.707]  And obviously war is a means to bring in control over the domestic population, but also power over the world in general, control of natural resources, these kind of things.
[02:38:00.807 --> 02:38:07.170]  I mean, it's all pretty, it's all just like, you know, it's just survival at the fittest amplified to a nasty level, really.
[02:38:07.190 --> 02:38:09.371]  I think that's kind of what's going on.
[02:38:10.956 --> 02:38:17.922]  Matt Bellamy, what response did you get after you went public wearing the Terror Storm t-shirt?
[02:38:18.203 --> 02:38:21.926]  What response did you get from your fans, your supporters, the media, others?
[02:38:21.986 --> 02:38:23.367]  Was there any backlash?
[02:38:24.909 --> 02:38:25.469]  Nothing really.
[02:38:25.529 --> 02:38:33.196]  A lot of the fans of the band are quite aware of some of my ideas and thoughts outside of the mainstream, if you like.
[02:38:33.697 --> 02:38:35.598]  So really, there's quite a bit of support there, really.
[02:38:37.077 --> 02:38:49.540]  Obviously, when you're doing interviews with more mainstream news companies, or whether it be magazines or something like that, they tend to steer clear of those kind of questions anyway.
[02:38:49.560 --> 02:38:58.982]  They tend to just avoid all of that stuff, and they tend to want to talk about more shallow subjects, which is fair enough, because I suppose that's what helps sell their magazines and so forth.
[02:38:59.402 --> 02:39:04.363]  But with the hardcore fans of the band, I mean, they seem to be quite interested in this stuff anyway.
[02:39:04.423 --> 02:39:06.184]  A lot of the people on the message board seem to be...
[02:39:07.260 --> 02:39:10.201]  Sometimes more clued up than me, I think, which is very encouraging.
[02:39:10.721 --> 02:39:10.962]  Sure.
[02:39:11.042 --> 02:39:14.163]  Have you had a chance to take the stage yet, or is that coming up tonight?
[02:39:14.663 --> 02:39:17.944]  It's actually going on in a couple of hours, so I'm getting warmed up right now.
[02:39:18.384 --> 02:39:18.725]  Wow.
[02:39:18.825 --> 02:39:22.546]  So are you playing before or after Willie Nelson?
[02:39:23.186 --> 02:39:24.127]  Willie was yesterday.
[02:39:27.893 --> 02:39:36.075]  Okay, well, hey, man, I've been in a coma, basically, so... Well, we're playing just before Tom Petty, I think, so... Wow, that's incredible!
[02:39:36.375 --> 02:39:37.136]  Half seven, yeah.
[02:39:37.176 --> 02:39:40.937]  Well, I mean, you guys are on the top ten of the charts here right now, and even higher in England.
[02:39:40.957 --> 02:39:41.897]  That's got to be exciting.
[02:39:42.617 --> 02:39:42.977]  Yeah, it's great.
[02:39:42.997 --> 02:39:43.698]  It's a great time for us.
[02:39:43.758 --> 02:39:55.161]  I mean, this album is the first album where I've started to bring in some of my political views into the actual lyrics of the album, and it's the first time I've really started talking about some of these things, and it's great that it happens to be on an album that is having the most success, so it's a good time.
[02:39:55.976 --> 02:39:58.837]  Well, you know, you mentioned out of the mainstream views.
[02:39:58.877 --> 02:40:01.818]  I think it's out of the mainstream that people have courage.
[02:40:01.858 --> 02:40:08.381]  I know a lot of other big rock stars and people who know all about 9-11 and contact me about it, but they're scared to death and won't go public.
[02:40:09.121 --> 02:40:11.222]  I mean, I commend your courage because...
[02:40:12.579 --> 02:40:14.420]  Your views are really mainstream.
[02:40:14.440 --> 02:40:21.782]  The majority of Americans and British in major polls, as well as Canadians, believe there's a cover-up, and a majority of those believe it's an inside job.
[02:40:22.062 --> 02:40:28.324]  The problem is, the majority of those that know it's an inside job are cowards, and they're not like you, Matt.
[02:40:28.624 --> 02:40:36.846]  So, again, from the bottom of my heart, I salute you, sir, for going public and speaking out and sending folks to Google Video to watch Terror Storm.
[02:40:37.246 --> 02:40:38.227]  And we're going to go to break.
[02:40:38.267 --> 02:40:38.947]  I want to get your...
[02:40:40.087 --> 02:40:45.349]  Get your number, get your manager's number, so I can contact you guys and have you on when it's a better time.
[02:40:45.829 --> 02:40:46.210]  Okay, great.
[02:40:46.250 --> 02:40:46.630]  Thanks a lot.
[02:40:46.650 --> 02:40:47.310]  Great to speak to you, though.
[02:40:47.530 --> 02:40:48.651]  Hey, great talking to you, sir.
[02:40:48.691 --> 02:40:49.331]  I'm a big fan.
[02:40:51.112 --> 02:40:52.412]  All right, and it works.
[02:40:52.512 --> 02:40:53.833]  I don't have time to play the other clip.
[02:40:53.913 --> 02:40:55.633]  Actually, my guys had clipped it together, right?
[02:40:55.693 --> 02:40:57.534]  They just had put the first on.
[02:40:57.554 --> 02:41:00.755]  It's just too long to play.
[02:41:01.756 --> 02:41:07.098]  But we're running out of time here today, and I've got other clips I want to get to.
[02:41:08.379 --> 02:41:16.041]  So we won't play the clip of where Mr. Bellamy is being interviewed by the 101X reporter, but I do appreciate the kind things she said as well.
[02:41:17.561 --> 02:41:24.282]  But again, I use this all as just an indices of how many people we're reaching, the effect we're having, the changes we're making.
[02:41:25.223 --> 02:41:29.123]  And it's all through you, the listeners of this radio broadcast.
[02:41:30.304 --> 02:41:36.905]  It's all through freedom lovers across the world who are refusing to go quietly and
[02:41:38.303 --> 02:41:38.824]  Into the night.
[02:41:40.065 --> 02:41:46.151]  And it's because of you and your perseverance and your commitment that we have a chance of not being completely enslaved.
[02:41:48.053 --> 02:41:49.514]  This is a lot bigger than George Bush.
[02:41:49.554 --> 02:42:00.745]  He's a very sinister, cold-blooded, scientifically focused group of people that is in control, that really have bad things in store for humanity.
[02:42:05.256 --> 02:42:06.276]  And they must be resisted.
[02:42:06.296 --> 02:42:07.676]  It's really that simple.
[02:42:08.417 --> 02:42:10.217]  Terror Storm is for free.
[02:42:11.817 --> 02:42:17.298]  You can go to Google Video and type in Terror Storm.
[02:42:17.438 --> 02:42:17.978]  Two words.
[02:42:19.578 --> 02:42:20.579]  Or one word if you'd like.
[02:42:21.359 --> 02:42:23.439]  And a whole bunch of links pop up.
[02:42:24.219 --> 02:42:26.780]  You'll want to pick one that says high quality or deluxe.
[02:42:27.920 --> 02:42:34.021]  You'll want to pick one that when you see the opening text you're able to read it on a better quality.
[02:42:34.679 --> 02:42:36.999]  And then, or just go to Infowars.com.
[02:42:37.019 --> 02:42:37.780]  We have a link to it.
[02:42:37.820 --> 02:42:39.340]  Rents.com is a big link to it.
[02:42:40.180 --> 02:42:44.601]  Get one of the high-quality versions, and please email it out to your entire email list.
[02:42:45.341 --> 02:42:49.882]  Please post it on every message board on MySpace.
[02:42:49.982 --> 02:43:02.345]  Please be aggressive with it, because if we're going to give this film away for free, our goal is to get it out to people, and we don't want that to not happen to the extent it could.
[02:43:03.085 --> 02:43:04.205]  Millions of people...
[02:43:05.331 --> 02:43:08.033]  Now, have seen it for free on Google Video.
[02:43:09.715 --> 02:43:10.315]  That's not enough.
[02:43:10.455 --> 02:43:12.457]  It needs to be tens of millions.
[02:43:13.858 --> 02:43:18.482]  And so please, today email it out to your whole email list.
[02:43:18.582 --> 02:43:19.783]  Email it out again next week.
[02:43:20.544 --> 02:43:21.564]  Go to a message board.
[02:43:21.624 --> 02:43:22.445]  Post it.
[02:43:22.525 --> 02:43:23.866]  I went to the trouble to make this film.
[02:43:24.727 --> 02:43:26.448]  Folks that have seen it have said it's my best work.
[02:43:26.528 --> 02:43:27.249]  I believe it is.
[02:43:28.530 --> 02:43:32.853]  And I know good and well that I lose a lot of money sitting there telling you just go get it for free.
[02:43:32.873 --> 02:43:33.734]  Don't even buy it from me.
[02:43:33.754 --> 02:43:34.595]  But I just don't care.
[02:43:35.265 --> 02:43:36.386]  I'm not going to have a country.
[02:43:36.466 --> 02:43:38.987]  I'm not going to be able to have my family live in a free society.
[02:43:39.547 --> 02:43:44.349]  I'm probably not even going to be around if we don't have a serious effect on these people.
[02:43:45.710 --> 02:43:46.670]  I mean, I'm committed.
[02:43:48.811 --> 02:43:49.831]  I'm fighting for my life.
[02:43:51.052 --> 02:43:55.354]  And I'm asking you for help in getting Terror Storm out to people.
[02:43:55.914 --> 02:43:58.535]  I know you hear a lot of calls to action, a lot of requests out there.
[02:43:59.456 --> 02:44:01.116]  But you know my request is important.
[02:44:01.156 --> 02:44:02.497]  My request is sincere.
[02:44:03.057 --> 02:44:04.498]  And my request is effective.
[02:44:05.473 --> 02:44:08.455]  By effective, the things we do have proven to be effective.
[02:44:09.355 --> 02:44:10.896]  We're not in this game to lose.
[02:44:12.557 --> 02:44:13.758]  We're not playing a game.
[02:44:15.399 --> 02:44:20.842]  And we've thrown our lot into this 110%, and we're asking you to throw in with us.
[02:44:21.903 --> 02:44:28.467]  If you want a super high-quality DVD with the 66 minutes of extras from the 9-11 Neocon Agenda Symposium, it's amazing.
[02:44:28.947 --> 02:44:29.748]  Four-camera shoot.
[02:44:30.468 --> 02:44:32.449]  It's over three hours of footage on one DVD.
[02:44:32.489 --> 02:44:34.831]  You can go to Infowars.com and get Terror Storm.
[02:44:36.334 --> 02:44:40.195]  And when you purchase a DVD, it does make what we do here possible, and we do need your support.
[02:44:41.775 --> 02:44:43.016]  And get the DVD.
[02:44:43.056 --> 02:44:44.296]  Make copies of it that way.
[02:44:44.356 --> 02:44:46.097]  That's a lot more effective than the Internet.
[02:44:47.217 --> 02:44:50.358]  That is, it looks better, people like it better.
[02:44:50.438 --> 02:44:55.519]  But the Internet overall to reach people is more effective because it's viral.
[02:44:58.960 --> 02:45:00.620]  So the ball is in your court.
[02:45:01.801 --> 02:45:02.541]  It is up to you.
[02:45:04.145 --> 02:45:07.526]  And you can buy it from us on DVD, or you can call toll-free, 1-888-253-3139.
[02:45:07.546 --> 02:45:08.426]  Again, that's 888-253-3139.
[02:45:08.486 --> 02:45:13.048]  Or you can also write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[02:45:13.108 --> 02:45:17.749]  You can also go to prisonplanet.tv, where for 15 cents a day, you can get all 15 of my videos.
[02:45:34.682 --> 02:45:42.967]  My book, Paul Watson's book, my weekly TV report, special video reports, there's over a thousand pieces of media up there, all my best audio interviews.
[02:45:43.367 --> 02:45:44.708]  It really is a ridiculous deal.
[02:45:45.128 --> 02:45:50.331]  PrisonPlanet.tv and your support of PrisonPlanet.tv makes everything we do possible.
[02:45:50.371 --> 02:45:56.094]  So I want to thank all the supporters out there and encourage those that aren't members to become members of PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:45:57.195 --> 02:46:00.597]  We have a cynical world where people don't believe you can affect change.
[02:46:00.617 --> 02:46:02.118]  I'm here to tell you you can affect change.
[02:46:02.808 --> 02:46:06.010]  The bad guys told you you didn't have power because they were scared of you.
[02:46:06.550 --> 02:46:08.591]  They taught us how to be cynical and stupid.
[02:46:09.692 --> 02:46:22.919]  And I'm telling you, cynicism, and I mean the type of cynicism, it's good to be cynical of government propaganda, but to be cynical of the individual, to be cynical of the fact that we can fight and effect change is a fraud and a lie.
[02:46:24.580 --> 02:46:27.422]  We have to have hope, and history shows we can have an effect.
[02:46:28.042 --> 02:46:29.823]  And it shows the world's never going to be perfect.
[02:46:30.342 --> 02:46:31.503]  At least until God comes back.
[02:46:31.543 --> 02:46:37.186]  But the thing I'm trying to say here is that it's a lot better place when good people get involved.
[02:46:37.747 --> 02:46:40.788]  And it gets real bad when good men and women aren't involved.
[02:46:41.889 --> 02:46:53.276]  That's kind of a paraphrase on all that evil tyrants need to flourish is that good men do nothing, or several variants of that by famous individuals.
[02:46:54.858 --> 02:46:57.780]  Interesting little report here I wanted to hit on briefly out of the Washington Post.
[02:46:57.800 --> 02:46:58.281]  Listen to this.
[02:46:58.801 --> 02:47:01.082]  Major problems at polls feared.
[02:47:01.483 --> 02:47:04.785]  Some officials say voting law changes and new technology will cause trouble.
[02:47:05.706 --> 02:47:07.927]  They're getting you ready for all the election stealing.
[02:47:08.788 --> 02:47:24.419]  An overhaul in how states and localities record votes and administer elections since the Florida recount battle six years ago has created conditions that could trigger a repeat, this time on a national scale, of last week's Election Day debacle in Maryland suburbs, election experts say.
[02:47:26.306 --> 02:47:27.567]  Is the drug war a debacle?
[02:47:28.288 --> 02:47:31.610]  No, they've got more drugs on the streets, more people in prison.
[02:47:32.651 --> 02:47:33.912]  Is the war on terror a debacle?
[02:47:33.972 --> 02:47:35.153]  Is the war on Iraq a failure?
[02:47:35.193 --> 02:47:39.336]  No, no, they're getting their oil and their bases, and the longer the war goes, the better for them.
[02:47:39.676 --> 02:47:40.437]  It's the same thing here.
[02:47:40.457 --> 02:47:48.383]  Remember, they promised the Help Americans Vote Act would help everybody, and they put in these special federally approved machines...
[02:47:49.875 --> 02:47:54.800]  Run by CIA fronts like Diabol and everything will be fine, then magically there's, quote, all these problems.
[02:47:55.380 --> 02:47:59.484]  There's exit polls show this guy wins, but it's always the incumbent or the Republican.
[02:48:01.126 --> 02:48:03.968]  So see, it's just, it's unbelievable.
[02:48:04.489 --> 02:48:07.452]  See, when we catch them stealing elections, it's called problems.
[02:48:07.612 --> 02:48:11.355]  Oh, we'll fix those with more of the same.
[02:48:12.516 --> 02:48:12.997]  Stay with us.
[02:48:20.189 --> 02:48:23.370]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[02:48:23.690 --> 02:48:25.610]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[02:48:26.010 --> 02:48:33.672]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:48:34.352 --> 02:48:41.393]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:48:41.794 --> 02:48:44.754]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran.
[02:48:45.114 --> 02:48:47.415]  A White House program to disseminate fake news.

[02:50:19.125 --> 02:50:21.207]  Hey, Bill, I'm buying lunch today.
[02:50:21.547 --> 02:50:22.367]  And check this out.
[02:50:22.688 --> 02:50:23.568]  I bought a new car.
[02:50:23.668 --> 02:50:28.892]  Wow, John, I guess you took my advice and visited that website we were talking about over lunch last time we met.
[02:50:29.452 --> 02:50:33.595]  www.didyourobbillgates.com I did, and you were right.
[02:50:33.915 --> 02:50:38.819]  I learned how to make $3,000 to $9,000 each and every week, starting with my very first week.

[02:51:06.314 --> 02:51:07.014]  Check, please.
[02:51:07.474 --> 02:51:08.375]  I got this one, Bill.
[02:51:08.755 --> 02:51:09.435]  Sure, John.
[02:51:09.595 --> 02:51:14.198]  Let's tell everyone about www.DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[02:51:14.338 --> 02:51:14.578]  Deal.
[02:51:19.466 --> 02:51:25.509]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:51:26.110 --> 02:51:29.091]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:51:31.052 --> 02:51:32.873]  You know, I just totally forgot about the callers.
[02:51:32.893 --> 02:51:37.816]  You know, I kind of blink out and start bubbling and raving and gibbering.
[02:51:37.936 --> 02:51:40.557]  It's called Radio Graffiti.
[02:51:40.617 --> 02:51:41.818]  I'm giving each person a minute.
[02:51:42.218 --> 02:51:44.740]  Joe in New York and Adam, George, Steve and Chris.
[02:51:44.760 --> 02:51:45.220]  Go ahead, Joe.
[02:51:45.240 --> 02:51:46.581]  Alex, how are you doing?
[02:51:46.861 --> 02:51:47.081]  Good.
[02:51:47.608 --> 02:51:50.609]  I just woke up about three months ago and I got a couple points for you.
[02:51:51.830 --> 02:51:59.393]  My daughter's boyfriend, they were both in 12th grade, they're seniors, and in their PIG class, which is politics and government, they watched Loose Change the other day.
[02:52:00.213 --> 02:52:10.838]  And my daughter's boyfriend was the only one that had any idea about this because I've been preaching at home, so he kind of fired back at the teacher, and the teacher was taken back and didn't realize that these kids would know what was going on.
[02:52:11.503 --> 02:52:15.224]  Well, I say good job to the teacher for showing that film.
[02:52:15.244 --> 02:52:21.667]  Well, I told my daughter's boyfriend that I have Terror Storm on order, and the minute I get that in, I'm going to burn him a copy.
[02:52:21.687 --> 02:52:23.187]  He's going to bring that in and show it to the class.
[02:52:23.288 --> 02:52:24.368]  Good job, Joe.
[02:52:25.008 --> 02:52:26.049]  Just two more quick points.
[02:52:26.389 --> 02:52:35.812]  I was in the store this weekend, and as you're going through the checkout line at the grocery store, you see these stupid tabloids, but one of them had a big headline, Mrs. Bush has a nervous breakdown.
[02:52:35.832 --> 02:52:37.613]  She tells President, I can't take it anymore.
[02:52:38.027 --> 02:52:41.348]  I think by the paper, but I didn't know if you knew anything about that.
[02:52:42.049 --> 02:52:45.430]  And the last point is, we saw a movie this weekend, Arlington Road.
[02:52:45.490 --> 02:52:46.310]  It's an old movie.
[02:52:46.350 --> 02:52:47.691]  Yeah, it's a good movie.
[02:52:48.151 --> 02:52:49.171]  Yeah, I just wanted to get that out.
[02:52:49.211 --> 02:52:50.632]  Arlington Road's a good movie, too.
[02:52:50.652 --> 02:52:55.694]  Yeah, it's how the group tricks the guy into making it look like he blew the building up when he really didn't.
[02:52:55.714 --> 02:52:57.835]  And that's exactly how they set Patsy's up.
[02:52:57.875 --> 02:52:58.815]  Thanks for the call, Joe.
[02:52:59.095 --> 02:53:00.416]  Yeah, give him a copy of Terror Storm.
[02:53:00.456 --> 02:53:00.976]  That's great.
[02:53:01.576 --> 02:53:03.517]  Let's go ahead and talk to Adam in Colorado.
[02:53:03.577 --> 02:53:04.197]  Adam, go ahead.
[02:53:05.571 --> 02:53:06.511]  Hi, Alex.
[02:53:06.531 --> 02:53:07.632]  Thank you for waking me up.
[02:53:07.792 --> 02:53:11.392]  I wanted to say that I think 9-11 is a big magic trick.
[02:53:11.832 --> 02:53:18.194]  The illusion, of course, making people believe the Twin Towers fell because of fire, planes, or whatever they spin it as nowadays.
[02:53:18.934 --> 02:53:19.294]  Yes.
[02:53:19.314 --> 02:53:23.995]  The diversion, of course, is the planes and the trick is the controlled demolition.
[02:53:24.415 --> 02:53:25.535]  Got a couple quotes here.
[02:53:26.235 --> 02:53:30.676]  The great masses of the people will more easily fall victim to a big lie than a small one.
[02:53:30.736 --> 02:53:32.017]  Adolf Hitler, Mein Kampf.
[02:53:33.057 --> 02:53:33.417]  And then...
[02:53:34.272 --> 02:53:39.954]  Any people that would give up liberty for a little bit of temporary safety deserves neither liberty nor safety.
[02:53:40.254 --> 02:53:41.435]  Benjamin Franklin said that.
[02:53:41.755 --> 02:53:42.035]  Yes.
[02:53:44.296 --> 02:53:45.216]  Keep up the good fight.
[02:53:45.276 --> 02:53:46.537]  I really thank you for what you're doing.
[02:53:46.577 --> 02:53:47.797]  I'm spreading terror storm.
[02:53:47.877 --> 02:53:49.038]  I got bump stickers.
[02:53:49.058 --> 02:53:50.938]  I'm doing my best here.
[02:53:51.359 --> 02:53:52.559]  Adam, I need your help.
[02:53:53.059 --> 02:53:54.120]  God bless you, my friend.
[02:53:54.180 --> 02:53:54.620]  Thank you.
[02:53:54.640 --> 02:53:56.460]  And I apologize for not going to calls earlier.
[02:53:56.480 --> 02:53:58.741]  I'm going to be back in the saddle tomorrow, folks.
[02:53:58.781 --> 02:53:59.982]  I better be 100% tomorrow.
[02:54:00.062 --> 02:54:02.443]  I cannot believe I'm going on five days sick.
[02:54:02.463 --> 02:54:02.903]  This is just...
[02:54:03.573 --> 02:54:04.595]  I'm a pathetic creature.
[02:54:05.136 --> 02:54:05.937]  Been working too hard.
[02:54:05.977 --> 02:54:08.742]  I probably rubbed down my immune system.
[02:54:08.842 --> 02:54:10.885]  Let's go ahead and talk to George in Indiana.
[02:54:10.905 --> 02:54:11.667]  George, go ahead.
[02:54:12.007 --> 02:54:14.872]  Yeah, I'm coming out with the same thing you went through.
[02:54:15.734 --> 02:54:16.315]  Two things.
[02:54:16.535 --> 02:54:16.815]  One is...
[02:54:18.311 --> 02:54:31.737]  The biggest lie I've seen Bush do is one where he built a lie upon lie, telling that story about seeing that first plane hit the building and then make the mistake of telling that story twice, and he built a lie on top of a lie to make a lie.
[02:54:31.757 --> 02:54:32.077]  That's right.
[02:54:32.097 --> 02:54:38.379]  He said he saw a plane hit the first building, but then that caught him in the real lie that then he lied again and said he hadn't seen either hit.
[02:54:38.619 --> 02:54:47.323]  Then the Times of London had the photos of him watching as both the buildings were smoking whenever he was behind the closed doors in the green room.
[02:54:47.663 --> 02:54:48.144]  Exactly.
[02:54:49.165 --> 02:54:50.147]  One other thing, though, Alex.
[02:54:50.808 --> 02:54:54.253]  What is your contingency plan if something happens and the Internet falls?
[02:54:54.613 --> 02:55:00.502]  You need to have a way where you can get to all of us, because we'll be lost if something happens and we can't get to you.
[02:55:01.042 --> 02:55:01.904]  Or you can't get to us.
[02:55:02.586 --> 02:55:04.067]  Well, I don't think you'll be lost.
[02:55:04.167 --> 02:55:06.708]  I mean, come on, a lot of you guys and gals are a lot smarter than I am.
[02:55:06.728 --> 02:55:07.668]  Boy, I'm the best we've got.
[02:55:07.688 --> 02:55:08.409]  We're in a lot of trouble.
[02:55:09.809 --> 02:55:12.490]  But... I can't even laugh off your coughing.
[02:55:12.871 --> 02:55:14.912]  But to make a long... I keep saying that.
[02:55:15.332 --> 02:55:17.553]  To make a long story short, my friend, we're out of time.
[02:55:17.973 --> 02:55:18.913]  You've got shortwave.
[02:55:19.934 --> 02:55:22.495]  You've got all those tapes and CDs you've burned to the shows.
[02:55:23.055 --> 02:55:23.955]  I appreciate your call.
[02:55:23.995 --> 02:55:27.017]  I apologize to Steve and Chris, both great Americans.
[02:55:27.517 --> 02:55:29.938]  Call me back tomorrow, and I'll put you at the front of the line, both of you.
[02:55:31.279 --> 02:55:31.859]  I apologize.
[02:55:32.944 --> 02:55:35.647]  I think I've apologized like ten times already, but it doesn't matter.
[02:55:35.727 --> 02:55:37.568]  I'll keep doing it and I apologize again.
[02:55:37.609 --> 02:55:38.610]  There, how does that sound?
[02:55:39.691 --> 02:55:40.611]  I just love you all.
[02:55:40.651 --> 02:55:46.057]  I'm so honored that you respect me and care about me and care what I have to say or think.
[02:55:46.377 --> 02:55:50.481]  I just am always amazed because from where I sit, it's pretty obvious to see what's going on.
[02:55:51.142 --> 02:55:53.184]  Hey, let's get out there and take on this new world order.
[02:55:53.544 --> 02:55:54.405]  God bless you all.
[02:55:57.179 --> 02:55:57.420]  Or call 877-300-7600.
