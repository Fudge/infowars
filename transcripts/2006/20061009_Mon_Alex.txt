[00:00:05.594 --> 00:00:06.235]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.896 --> 00:00:07.938]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.679 --> 00:00:09.781]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.422 --> 00:00:11.243]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.024 --> 00:00:12.805]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.547 --> 00:00:17.528]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.748 --> 00:00:21.809]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:37.296 --> 00:00:38.297]  Welcome, my friends.
[00:00:38.397 --> 00:00:41.641]  Very important broadcast lined up for you today, obviously.
[00:00:41.661 --> 00:00:55.857]  It is October 9th, 2006, and North Korea, yesterday, on Sunday, tested an A-bomb or hydrogen weapon of some type.
[00:00:56.077 --> 00:00:57.439]  No one's really sure.
[00:00:58.402 --> 00:00:58.862]  We're good to go.
[00:01:24.677 --> 00:01:39.327]  Not just with the reactors to get the fissile material, but the enabling technology, the centrifuges, the missile components, the guidance systems.
[00:01:40.227 --> 00:01:48.553]  Oh, the police are going to pull you over on the side of the highway in Nebraska or Ohio and say, we want to search your car, and you'll say, why?
[00:01:48.993 --> 00:01:51.355]  Well, it's the new age, 9-11, everything changed.
[00:01:54.102 --> 00:01:59.104]  And, of course, that police officer doing that doesn't know that his own government carried out 9-11.
[00:01:59.504 --> 00:02:03.565]  That police officer doesn't know that his own government leaves the border wide open.
[00:02:04.146 --> 00:02:05.146]  Maybe he's starting to learn.
[00:02:05.186 --> 00:02:07.047]  He doesn't know that they've armed North Korea.
[00:02:07.067 --> 00:02:09.808]  He doesn't know that criminals have hijacked the country.
[00:02:10.488 --> 00:02:17.651]  But there it is in plain view, as usual, our government building up and funding the best enemies money can buy.
[00:02:18.151 --> 00:02:21.592]  And so that's why when a police officer wants to search my car, I laugh at them.
[00:02:22.466 --> 00:02:27.089]  If they bring up the drugs, I say, I don't use government products.
[00:02:27.369 --> 00:02:28.650]  I don't carry government products.
[00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:29.831]  I've actually sent this to police.
[00:02:30.491 --> 00:02:32.593]  I don't use what your bosses ship in.
[00:02:32.613 --> 00:02:36.515]  I go, come on, you know the government ships most of them in, don't you?
[00:02:36.855 --> 00:02:38.917]  With their allied banks.
[00:02:40.358 --> 00:02:46.221]  I'm already digressing here, just a minute or two into this transmission against tyranny.
[00:02:47.722 --> 00:02:51.705]  We will go over all of the latest North Korean news.
[00:02:52.737 --> 00:02:53.538]  I think we're good to go.
[00:03:12.023 --> 00:03:13.604]  Makes them that much more dangerous.
[00:03:13.644 --> 00:03:27.669]  And now the wild card of North Korea, one of many wild cards, but one of the ace cards of the wild cards, very, very dangerous situation, is this psychopath.
[00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:37.152]  He is a psychopath, Kim Jong-il, the hereditary dictator of North Korea, is running around threatening to nuke everyone, threatening to nuke Japan.
[00:03:37.612 --> 00:03:39.953]  Japan is totally scrapping their...
[00:03:41.161 --> 00:03:43.822]  Their previous constitution of non-aggression.
[00:03:44.162 --> 00:03:45.402]  They're going to preemptive.
[00:03:45.462 --> 00:03:50.044]  They, of course, have covertly been building a large nuclear arsenal for at least a decade.
[00:03:50.584 --> 00:03:54.325]  That's in the major weapons publications like Jane's and is confirmed.
[00:03:54.946 --> 00:03:57.406]  And so they're coming out of the closet with their weaponry.
[00:03:58.087 --> 00:04:00.487]  China's openly threatening to invade Taiwan.
[00:04:01.108 --> 00:04:08.070]  Russia, Putin's having journalists killed left and right and building up their new Topol-M missiles.
[00:04:09.102 --> 00:04:12.324]  And re-arming and expanding their military again.
[00:04:13.585 --> 00:04:19.129]  The Red Stars, the Hammer and Sickles, have been slapped back on their entire military forces.
[00:04:19.149 --> 00:04:21.251]  Our media says it doesn't exist.
[00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:36.668]  Again, 30 million illegals are openly calling for a reconquista, and the breakdown of the U.S., the North American Union is forming, the United States is dying, the dollar is plunging in value, and the average American has no idea of what I even just said.
[00:04:37.069 --> 00:04:44.833]  I don't mean you, the listeners, but the average American is the most uninformed, I don't want to say stupid, just focused on mindlessness.
[00:04:45.894 --> 00:04:51.617]  So, for the average American, keep reading your Hollywood pages, stay on your Weight Watchers, and
[00:04:52.333 --> 00:04:56.976]  Go to the ballgame and enjoy all that's flowing forward.
[00:04:56.996 --> 00:04:59.078]  We'll be right back with all the news.
[00:04:59.138 --> 00:04:59.798]  It's massive.
[00:04:59.818 --> 00:05:00.719]  Stay with us.
[00:05:04.341 --> 00:05:07.523]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[00:05:07.863 --> 00:05:09.805]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[00:05:10.165 --> 00:05:17.790]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:25.554]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:05:25.954 --> 00:05:37.401]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:05:37.681 --> 00:05:41.203]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:05:41.663 --> 00:05:43.584]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:05:43.925 --> 00:05:47.747]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:06:01.315 --> 00:06:06.280]  Now you can bring Berkey Purification Power anywhere with the Sport Berkey Filtration Bottle.
[00:06:06.601 --> 00:06:12.026]  Ideal for sporting games, camping or boating, or Sport Berkey is small enough to store in your glove box.
[00:06:12.066 --> 00:06:16.351]  So it's ideal backup for unexpected emergencies like blackouts, floods or earthquakes.
[00:06:16.691 --> 00:06:19.714]  It's simply the best personal water filtration system available.
[00:06:20.014 --> 00:06:23.458]  So effective you can drink raw, untreated water from lakes, rivers and streams.
[00:06:23.778 --> 00:06:33.142]  Unlike other sport bottles, the Sport Berkeys patented filter formulation is so powerful it removes cysts, parasites, harmful bacteria, and chemicals like herbicides and pesticides.
[00:06:33.382 --> 00:06:36.883]  It even reduces radon-222, lead, and other heavy metals.
[00:06:37.123 --> 00:06:44.246]  This lightweight, rugged 22-ounce filter is small enough to go everywhere, so take one to work and keep another in your glove box for emergencies.
[00:06:44.506 --> 00:06:45.826]  Get the Berkey Sport for only $39.
[00:06:45.866 --> 00:06:47.567]  Get two for $70 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:06:53.689 --> 00:07:03.611]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network.
[00:07:03.731 --> 00:07:06.092]  I have an urgent message for all of our listeners.
[00:07:06.152 --> 00:07:13.233]  The mass media keeps telling us that we are the richest, most powerful economy in the world, quote-unquote.
[00:07:13.813 --> 00:07:16.094]  If this is true, why can't we pay our bills?
[00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:20.312]  Why is the United States the world's largest debtor nation?
[00:07:20.853 --> 00:07:24.995]  The truth is that we are in the worst debt bubble in our nation's history.
[00:07:25.576 --> 00:07:28.558]  When the bubble bursts, will you be able to feed your family?
[00:07:29.518 --> 00:07:32.440]  When the inevitable crash occurs, will you be ready?
[00:07:33.181 --> 00:07:35.622]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.
[00:07:35.662 --> 00:07:37.704]  That's 1-888-892-6238 for the following two free reports.
[00:07:46.798 --> 00:07:47.078]  U.S.
[00:07:47.158 --> 00:07:50.039]  debt bubble, red alert, and real estate crash.
[00:07:51.039 --> 00:07:58.921]  Call 888-8XANADU, that's 888-8XANADU, and ask for George.
[00:08:01.002 --> 00:08:08.744]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show, because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:08.764 --> 00:08:11.265]  The Alex Jones Show
[00:08:16.508 --> 00:08:21.153]  Okay, there have been big, new, important developments on the Foley situation.
[00:08:22.334 --> 00:08:38.170]  There have obviously been gigantic, colossal, geopolitical, 10 on the Richter scale, seismic events politically with North Korea testing what looks like it was some type of medium yield.
[00:08:39.296 --> 00:08:40.417]  A hydrogen weapon.
[00:08:40.637 --> 00:08:42.298]  They're saying it's a hydrogen bomb.
[00:08:43.059 --> 00:08:44.420]  Others are saying it's an A-bomb.
[00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:45.901]  It doesn't matter.
[00:08:46.341 --> 00:08:50.364]  We know that Kim Jong-il, for a decade, has had at least one bomb.
[00:08:50.804 --> 00:08:53.707]  I remember the assessments five years ago saying six weapons.
[00:08:54.547 --> 00:08:56.889]  Now they're claiming he has enough material for seven.
[00:08:57.189 --> 00:09:04.594]  That's our government, our criminal government, playing down the threat of North Korea, who hit us with a missile in 2000.
[00:09:05.915 --> 00:09:06.256]  We were hit...
[00:09:08.644 --> 00:09:14.808]  The United States was hit by a missile six years ago.
[00:09:14.828 --> 00:09:16.869]  It was not carrying a warhead.
[00:09:16.909 --> 00:09:19.951]  It was a Taipan Dong-2 experimental.
[00:09:20.051 --> 00:09:27.896]  It broke up on re-entry, but fragments of the missile were recovered by the Army.
[00:09:29.478 --> 00:09:33.140]  We know Army helicopters went and retrieved it in Alaska.
[00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:36.282]  We were hit by the missile,
[00:09:37.071 --> 00:09:38.112]  The missile came in.
[00:09:38.212 --> 00:09:40.013]  It's re-entry.
[00:09:41.414 --> 00:09:47.217]  MIRV, supposedly, even at that time, they had a primitive MIRV technology.
[00:09:47.677 --> 00:09:49.759]  That's the Multiple Re-Entry Device Systems.
[00:09:50.759 --> 00:09:53.181]  And it came in and broke up, though.
[00:09:53.881 --> 00:09:57.583]  And it's incredible.
[00:09:57.603 --> 00:10:00.685]  We were hit by a North Korean test missile.
[00:10:02.186 --> 00:10:03.107]  It's outrageous.
[00:10:04.122 --> 00:10:33.796]  And that was kept real quiet, because the neocons even then, who were already manipulating and controlling much of our government even then, I mean, it doesn't matter what administration it is, it's the same New World War crowd, were planning to go into Iraq, were planning to go into Afghanistan, were planning to attack innocent countries that have done nothing wrong, and you can't really do that if, you know, a country's firing test missiles at you, they're threatening to nuke you, and then you ignore that, and you go attack a country that's done nothing to you.
[00:10:34.364 --> 00:10:36.085]  So it's always been kept real quiet.
[00:10:36.385 --> 00:10:40.087]  It was in Japanese and North Korean and South Korean papers.
[00:10:40.808 --> 00:10:43.850]  It even came out in some Russian papers, the test missile.
[00:10:45.270 --> 00:10:46.951]  But it's been kept quiet here.
[00:10:47.832 --> 00:10:50.433]  And we've done big reports on it over the years.
[00:10:51.354 --> 00:10:52.375]  So I'm already digressing.
[00:10:52.395 --> 00:10:53.375]  There's so much data.
[00:10:53.795 --> 00:10:57.277]  Let me just attempt to calmly go through the North Korean situation.
[00:10:58.438 --> 00:11:03.381]  And then some will say, why are you going to even talk about Foley when this is going on in North Korea?
[00:11:05.146 --> 00:11:10.148]  Because the Foley scandal ties into it.
[00:11:11.308 --> 00:11:22.892]  The Foley scandal is threatening to bring down the Republican leadership in the House, and now it's leaking into the Senate because it's system-wide in the legislative branch.
[00:11:24.293 --> 00:11:27.334]  There is a pervert guild in control of our government.
[00:11:27.374 --> 00:11:28.954]  How many years have we told you this?
[00:11:29.394 --> 00:11:30.855]  The evidence is mountainous.
[00:11:32.659 --> 00:11:51.464]  It's a cornucopia of mainstream news of underage callboys and porn stars and late night hooker visits and the male hookers with the underage ones in tow, you know, 14 to 16, running around stealing Dolly Madison's plates, you know, worth millions of dollars.
[00:11:51.524 --> 00:11:52.644]  I mean, this is getting insane.
[00:11:53.197 --> 00:12:07.504]  That was in the late 80s, 89, and then now the Jeff Gannon porn star, male madam, and in hundreds of late-night visits with, I mean, I guess at least these guys are 25, 30, 35 years old.
[00:12:07.544 --> 00:12:10.865]  I guess they've stopped bringing the 14-year-olds in.
[00:12:11.485 --> 00:12:14.427]  But the Republican taste, folks, is for men.
[00:12:14.867 --> 00:12:16.668]  Democrats tend to be like women.
[00:12:16.928 --> 00:12:17.408]  I don't know.
[00:12:17.428 --> 00:12:19.629]  It's just so crazy.
[00:12:19.949 --> 00:12:20.389]  I don't know.
[00:12:20.470 --> 00:12:21.430]  I just can't believe it.
[00:12:23.715 --> 00:12:24.716]  We're in so much trouble.
[00:12:25.096 --> 00:12:26.337]  Of course they're blackmailed.
[00:12:26.737 --> 00:12:31.500]  Of course England and Israel and Russia and China and everybody else is blackmailing us.
[00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:32.801]  We're a joke, folks.
[00:12:32.821 --> 00:12:34.622]  We're totally wide open.
[00:12:34.642 --> 00:12:36.103]  There's mass looting going on.
[00:12:36.163 --> 00:12:37.724]  Trillions missing from the Pentagon.
[00:12:39.124 --> 00:12:42.146]  And they're just militarizing the police and building FEMA camps.
[00:12:42.246 --> 00:12:43.227]  And we're in deep trouble.
[00:12:43.467 --> 00:12:53.253]  You better hit your knees and pray for God to wake up the average person in this country and to turn this around and give us a reprieve like Nineveh got.
[00:12:57.327 --> 00:12:59.168]  All right, but again, I'm digressing already.
[00:12:59.528 --> 00:13:03.230]  It is an important story because it puts the neocons up against the wall.
[00:13:05.071 --> 00:13:06.952]  It puts the neocons in a corner.
[00:13:08.313 --> 00:13:12.315]  And you've got Iraq falling apart even worse than what they'd originally planned.
[00:13:13.175 --> 00:13:21.560]  You've got Afghanistan falling into disarray and civil war and warlords killing each other in our tribes.
[00:13:22.378 --> 00:13:22.799]  We're good to go.
[00:13:34.469 --> 00:13:38.770]  And they, in this Ponzi scheme, either a Ponzi scheme gets bigger or it implodes.
[00:13:38.890 --> 00:13:40.691]  And people keep saying, well, what's a Ponzi scheme?
[00:13:41.031 --> 00:13:45.853]  For those that don't know, a Ponzi scheme is where you tell people, I've got this great investment.
[00:13:46.233 --> 00:13:48.053]  I've got this great startup company.
[00:13:48.093 --> 00:13:52.755]  And it's normally something like Enron, in a better case, at least something real is being traded.
[00:13:52.795 --> 00:13:56.096]  But in some cases, it's fake real estate, mining stock, whatever.
[00:13:56.816 --> 00:14:02.118]  And you take in money, and you've got some seed money for your scam.
[00:14:02.927 --> 00:14:09.431]  And so you pay those first three or four investors back 20%, 30%, 40% that first year.
[00:14:09.871 --> 00:14:17.096]  And they run off and tell all their friends at the country club or at church, my gosh, I made a 30% return on my investment in the first year.
[00:14:17.416 --> 00:14:21.018]  So now instead of 20 people, 1,000 show up.
[00:14:21.418 --> 00:14:22.879]  And then that's when the scam starts.
[00:14:23.279 --> 00:14:25.881]  You then pay them maybe 10%, 15%.
[00:14:26.701 --> 00:14:29.163]  They run and tell everybody else how great it is.
[00:14:29.898 --> 00:14:40.262]  But as the Ponzi scheme, the pyramid scheme builds, you've got to be bringing in more, more, more, more, more to pay off the last wave that's smaller.
[00:14:40.762 --> 00:14:57.428]  And at a certain point, the thing gets so big that it starts teetering and smoking and sputtering, and you've got to basically run to Spain or Switzerland or Mexico or wherever you go with $100 million and hope they don't indict you.
[00:15:00.143 --> 00:15:03.445]  And you get a million people left holding the bag.
[00:15:03.625 --> 00:15:12.090]  And sure, the first 100,000 that invested, they got a good payoff on the Ponzi scheme, on the multi-level marketing scam.
[00:15:14.092 --> 00:15:16.313]  And so that's how global government works.
[00:15:16.333 --> 00:15:19.595]  That's how currency scams work.
[00:15:19.795 --> 00:15:25.519]  From 1913 until the 1970s, you had a tripling of the money supply, roughly.
[00:15:26.079 --> 00:15:29.081]  And then from the 1970s to the late 80s, you had a doubling.
[00:15:29.824 --> 00:15:33.286]  And then from the late 80s until the late 90s, you had a doubling.
[00:15:33.626 --> 00:15:37.868]  And then from 1999 until 2005, you had a doubling.
[00:15:37.928 --> 00:15:47.233]  So it takes 30, 40 years to get a doubling, another 30, 40 years to get a doubling again, and then it takes 10 years, and then it takes 5 years.
[00:15:47.293 --> 00:15:55.778]  And now Bernanke, the new Fed chief, is saying he's going to double in two years, and for the first time since 1913, they make the M3 money supply secret.
[00:15:56.779 --> 00:15:57.819]  And they're not releasing the debt.
[00:15:57.839 --> 00:15:59.420]  They said, we're going to double it, and they made it secret.
[00:15:59.975 --> 00:16:01.236]  So it could be a quadrupling.
[00:16:01.276 --> 00:16:01.676]  We don't know.
[00:16:01.736 --> 00:16:10.139]  See, here at the end, it's just like Germany, where finally it was doubling every week, every day.
[00:16:10.479 --> 00:16:13.020]  See, we're now entering that area of the equation.
[00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:15.621]  And it's the same thing with the war.
[00:16:16.841 --> 00:16:19.483]  With the war, things aren't going well in Iraq.
[00:16:19.503 --> 00:16:20.843]  Well, if you read the Israeli and U.S.
[00:16:20.863 --> 00:16:23.324]  war plans, it was never meant to go well.
[00:16:24.295 --> 00:16:39.819]  It was meant to fall apart, and then they leverage into the next theater conflict, have a national draft preceded by a huge terrorist attack or global catastrophe, and then police state domestically, and then millions of people are drafted, and then, oh, don't worry, we can then win the war.
[00:16:40.199 --> 00:16:41.319]  You see, it's all about winning.
[00:16:41.399 --> 00:16:42.579]  Oh, we can't pull out.
[00:16:42.599 --> 00:16:43.620]  It's like a gambler.
[00:16:43.820 --> 00:16:53.822]  They've got the American people like at the casino going, well, I'm behind $10,000, and I just better go ahead and mortgage the house because I know I can get back in there and get my money back.
[00:16:57.347 --> 00:17:03.988]  It's this huge, spinning, hurricane vortex, order out of chaos, we've been sucked into here.
[00:17:06.889 --> 00:17:08.649]  And, I mean, it's scary, folks.
[00:17:08.969 --> 00:17:10.569]  I was exhausted last night.
[00:17:10.609 --> 00:17:12.910]  I went out to the country, out to our ranch.
[00:17:13.370 --> 00:17:17.390]  Didn't have any news cameras there posing as a cowboy, but I did enjoy myself.
[00:17:17.690 --> 00:17:25.512]  I like cutting down trees and chainsawing out roads where trees are falling across them and ride around on four-wheelers, do stuff like that with the family.
[00:17:25.672 --> 00:17:26.592]  My children just loved it.
[00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:29.661]  We're good to go.
[00:17:48.817 --> 00:18:04.983]  I wanted to tell the audience this, and we'll go to break, and I promise we'll go back and detail monotonously, but it's very important, all the different facets of the North Korean situation, very serious, and how the Foley situation ties into that, the Foley firestorm.
[00:18:06.664 --> 00:18:10.625]  But I just wanted to...
[00:18:11.542 --> 00:18:21.228]  Last time I almost got up and wrote notes of what I wanted to say and then I went to sleep and I just remembered I was thinking about this last night and I wanted to say it and I can't really remember how to phrase my words or how I want to put it.
[00:18:25.211 --> 00:18:38.679]  My frustration is that I know I'm not perfect and I'm not perfect in my analysis or my delivery or the way I even come across or the things I do but at least I'm standing up and doing the best job I know how.
[00:18:39.787 --> 00:18:42.028]  And at least we try to give you the best information.
[00:18:42.188 --> 00:18:44.748]  I think we do a pretty good job most of the time.
[00:18:46.008 --> 00:18:55.451]  And my frustration is that I don't do some of the things I wish I knew how to do.
[00:18:55.651 --> 00:18:58.231]  I don't even know what I'm trying to say to you, the listeners.
[00:18:58.291 --> 00:19:05.113]  It's just that these are the times that try men's soul, as one great statesman said, or was it a writer?
[00:19:07.236 --> 00:19:16.931]  And, I don't know, I'll think about it during the break and try to codify my thoughts again, recodify them, reconstitute them, and go over it.
[00:19:16.972 --> 00:19:18.454]  Because it is important.
[00:19:20.377 --> 00:19:21.078]  It is important.
[00:19:23.026 --> 00:19:26.408]  And I think at the end of the day what I'm trying to say is it doesn't matter if we're perfect.
[00:19:26.808 --> 00:19:28.849]  It doesn't matter if our delivery's perfect.
[00:19:29.069 --> 00:19:30.950]  It doesn't matter if you've got all the answers.
[00:19:31.330 --> 00:19:33.911]  You know something's wrong and you know we're going in the wrong direction.
[00:19:34.291 --> 00:19:46.436]  And all of us together have to stop worrying about being perfect and just worry about getting out there on the field and taking action at this critical juncture, this critical crossroads in world and human history.
[00:19:47.157 --> 00:19:47.777]  All right, we come back.
[00:19:47.817 --> 00:19:48.577]  We'll go to North Korea.
[00:19:48.617 --> 00:19:50.338]  And then later I'll...
[00:19:52.174 --> 00:20:06.758]  Do you know the truth about breast cancer?
[00:20:07.259 --> 00:20:09.679]  Do you realize that the race for the cure is over?
[00:20:10.459 --> 00:20:18.842]  The best kept secret in the world today is that now it's possible to kill cancer without personal suffering, mutilation, and poisoning of your entire system.
[00:20:19.847 --> 00:20:24.730]  Now it's cancer's turn to die, with LaysMed Incorporated's patented methodology.
[00:20:25.370 --> 00:20:35.375]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation, we can destroy skin cancer and breast tumors of any size without adverse side effects at a physician's office.
[00:20:35.855 --> 00:20:38.177]  Star War technology at its best.
[00:20:38.937 --> 00:20:40.198]  For more information, call 702-953-0267.
[00:20:40.218 --> 00:20:40.258]  702-953-0267.
[00:20:52.943 --> 00:21:07.514]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson, here for the 2007 Red Book.
[00:21:08.695 --> 00:21:13.519]  The commodity markets like gold, silver, copper, aluminum, and oil have exploded over the last year.
[00:21:13.719 --> 00:21:16.461]  This is a glaring testimony of how quickly the U.S.
[00:21:16.501 --> 00:21:17.582]  dollar can be devalued.
[00:21:18.934 --> 00:21:23.537]  Many have turned to precious metals to provide a safe haven while increasing the potential profits.
[00:21:24.457 --> 00:21:31.721]  Though accumulating precious metals has been a proven method for the storage of wealth, it is important that you understand the market you are getting into.
[00:21:32.722 --> 00:21:35.784]  Midas Resources is offering the Red Book and Silver Dollar for only $27.95.
[00:21:36.024 --> 00:21:41.387]  The Red Book is the number one best-selling guide to gold and silver coins.

[00:21:53.701 --> 00:21:54.001]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:21:54.021 --> 00:21:54.321]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:01.952 --> 00:22:02.253]  Thank you.
[00:22:22.773 --> 00:22:23.494]  We're good to go.
[00:22:50.172 --> 00:22:51.894]  Call now and get free shipping.
[00:22:52.095 --> 00:22:52.275]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:23:02.712 --> 00:23:04.393]  Hello, this is Amy Bjorklund.
[00:23:04.574 --> 00:23:07.175]  Are you totally satisfied with the nourishment you're getting?
[00:23:07.276 --> 00:23:10.298]  Do you have enough energy to do everything you really want to do?
[00:23:10.538 --> 00:23:14.000]  And are you content to remain in your current state of health indefinitely?
[00:23:14.281 --> 00:23:20.125]  Have you already tried diets, exercise, vitamins, juicing, or the latest greatest nutritional wonder products?
[00:23:20.465 --> 00:23:25.247]  Perhaps those things have grown tiresome and not made you feel and look as well as you'd really like to.
[00:23:25.487 --> 00:23:35.892]  But what if you found from a single source the world's freshest, purest, most complete, whole, live food nourishment that tastes delicious and couldn't be any easier to consume?
[00:23:36.172 --> 00:23:37.453]  Well, you just did.
[00:23:37.813 --> 00:23:38.793]  So don't hesitate.
[00:23:38.893 --> 00:23:42.935]  Take the living energy you've always wanted from your nutrition right now.
[00:23:43.215 --> 00:23:48.638]  Visit truthinexcellence.com, click the Truth in Excellence banner on GCNlive.com,
[00:23:49.478 --> 00:23:52.641]  Or call me, Amy Bjorklund, personally at 805-595-2711.
[00:23:52.661 --> 00:23:52.781]  805-595-2711.
[00:23:53.041 --> 00:24:04.931]  I was going to have the liberal law who does the World War IV report to debate me today about 9-11 not being an inside job.
[00:24:18.007 --> 00:24:22.742]  But I just told my producer in there to fire him out the airlock, as we say around here.
[00:24:22.982 --> 00:24:23.664]  I'm canceling.
[00:24:24.981 --> 00:24:27.123]  I may even cancel the guests we've got in the third hour.
[00:24:27.143 --> 00:24:34.187]  We'll just push them back and have them on for 30 minutes because I want to give you a chance to respond to all the different crises.
[00:24:34.227 --> 00:24:37.369]  You know, the government's saying terrorists are about to hit us any minute.
[00:24:38.090 --> 00:24:40.131]  Oh, Al-Qaeda's about to strike.
[00:24:40.191 --> 00:24:41.092]  It's guaranteed.
[00:24:41.132 --> 00:24:43.393]  They've snuck nukes across the border.
[00:24:43.434 --> 00:24:44.754]  Give up all your liberties.
[00:24:45.275 --> 00:24:46.876]  Oh, we've got to go into Iran.
[00:24:47.016 --> 00:24:48.897]  Oh, we've got the aircraft carrier staged.
[00:24:48.937 --> 00:24:49.738]  We're ready to attack.
[00:24:50.058 --> 00:24:52.780]  North Korea's testing nuclear weapons.
[00:24:54.151 --> 00:24:55.332]  All of this is happening.
[00:24:55.452 --> 00:24:56.473]  All of this is going on.
[00:24:56.793 --> 00:25:11.523]  You throw into the mix a midterm election compacted with Foley running around and now it's breaking through to people like Dennis Hastert who we'll be talking about.
[00:25:11.563 --> 00:25:15.566]  Dennis Hastert and his chief of staff would live together.
[00:25:15.646 --> 00:25:17.107]  He's very conservative.
[00:25:17.827 --> 00:25:18.788]  No big deal though.
[00:25:19.445 --> 00:25:20.806]  It's very conservative.
[00:25:21.107 --> 00:25:30.617]  What's going to happen if the Christian conservatives in this country... Well, they'll probably say that men need to live together and you're of the devil if you don't.
[00:25:31.278 --> 00:25:36.423]  And I'll be a liberal because I'm a... All right, I've got to stop it.
[00:25:36.763 --> 00:25:37.704]  I've got to stop it right there.
[00:25:38.065 --> 00:25:40.107]  But I did just fire the guest out the airlock.
[00:25:41.044 --> 00:25:41.924]  I'm not trying to be mean.
[00:25:41.964 --> 00:25:46.405]  I apologize to the guest, but maybe we'll have him back on next week for the debate.
[00:25:46.625 --> 00:25:50.046]  It's always nice to have a debate about 9-11 and cream the other side.
[00:25:51.026 --> 00:25:53.407]  We have to import people who disagree to this broadcast.
[00:25:53.427 --> 00:25:55.707]  By the way, if you disagree with me, go to the head of the line, 1-800-259-9231, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:26:05.544 --> 00:26:08.625]  And your calls are coming up later in the shower, throughout the broadcast today.
[00:26:08.645 --> 00:26:09.706]  We're going to take a lot of calls.
[00:26:09.766 --> 00:26:14.007]  But let me now get into what's happened in North Korea.
[00:26:14.347 --> 00:26:16.608]  Let me just cover the news, and I'll get into analysis.
[00:26:17.088 --> 00:26:29.111]  North Korea has conducted a test, what would be yesterday afternoon here in the U.S., and of course last night, or in the early morning hours for them.
[00:26:29.792 --> 00:26:34.473]  North Korea may conduct another nuclear test at Yonhap
[00:26:35.123 --> 00:26:36.184]  This is out of Reuters.
[00:26:36.204 --> 00:26:37.584]  It came out just about an hour ago.
[00:26:37.644 --> 00:26:45.008]  The chief of South Korea's intelligence agency told lawmakers today it was possible North Korea would carry out a second nuclear test.
[00:26:45.429 --> 00:26:53.313]  Seoul's Yonhap News Agency quoted, One member of parliament is saying, the lawmaker also quoted,
[00:26:54.102 --> 00:27:05.985]  Kim Sung-Joo, head of the National Intelligence Service, is telling a closed-door parliamentary committee meeting that unusual signs have been detected at North Korea's town in the afternoon.
[00:27:07.385 --> 00:27:09.225]  At a North Korean town in the afternoon.
[00:27:09.646 --> 00:27:16.487]  North Korea announced earlier in the day it had successfully conducted an underground nuclear test inside of a mountain tunnel.
[00:27:17.647 --> 00:27:20.528]  So now they may test another weapon.
[00:27:21.909 --> 00:27:30.420]  And it says that Japan has launched fighter jets there in the Sea of Japan, getting very close to North Korean airspace.
[00:27:31.147 --> 00:27:44.572]  Japan's defense agency on Monday deployed three air self-defense T-4 jets to check levels of radioactivity over the Sea of Japan and other areas following North Korea's announcement about its nuclear test.
[00:27:44.612 --> 00:27:54.075]  The agency's moved to collect samples at an altitude of 10 kilometers as part of a Japanese government's effort to step up its monitoring of the impact of the reported nuclear test.
[00:27:55.623 --> 00:28:07.293]  Japan is now openly discussing abandoning their constitution formed under the government of Governor MacArthur back in the 1940s, early 1950s.
[00:28:08.033 --> 00:28:10.215]  A non-aggression, non-offensive military pact was
[00:28:17.691 --> 00:28:21.735]  They are openly discussing abandoning that and, quote, developing nuclear weapons.
[00:28:22.135 --> 00:28:29.523]  And my intel going back a decade is that over concerns with North Korea, they began covertly developing nuclear weapons.
[00:28:29.923 --> 00:28:34.808]  And they've had a lot of bizarre nuclear spills that have been kept quiet but been in the Japanese press.
[00:28:35.748 --> 00:28:36.209]  We're good to go.
[00:29:05.535 --> 00:29:11.560]  And when we get back from break, I want to go through this BBC headline, Khan gave North Korea centrifuges.
[00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:14.122]  Disgraced Pakistani scientist A.Q.
[00:29:14.302 --> 00:29:21.147]  Khan supplied North Korea with centrifuges and their designs, President Perez Musharraf has confirmed.
[00:29:21.167 --> 00:29:23.750]  Of course, we knew this years ago.
[00:29:24.210 --> 00:29:26.572]  And who blocked the investigation of A.Q.
[00:29:26.612 --> 00:29:28.413]  Khan laboratories?
[00:29:28.713 --> 00:29:29.174]  None other...
[00:29:30.282 --> 00:29:34.144]  Then George W. Bush in 2001.
[00:29:34.184 --> 00:29:38.866]  Donald Rumsfeld on the board of the Swiss company ABV.
[00:29:40.827 --> 00:29:43.428]  Back in 1996 with the transfer.
[00:29:43.968 --> 00:29:49.951]  So we'll let you know the details of who armed this enemy when we get back.
[00:29:51.672 --> 00:29:52.572]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.052 --> 00:29:54.653]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.673 --> 00:29:58.275]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[00:31:12.348 --> 00:31:12.908]  We listened.
[00:31:13.249 --> 00:31:18.373]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[00:31:18.654 --> 00:31:19.154]  We listened.
[00:31:19.555 --> 00:31:22.677]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[00:31:23.118 --> 00:31:23.678]  We listened.
[00:31:24.139 --> 00:31:26.341]  You asked us to include an emergency light for
[00:31:28.882 --> 00:31:29.202]  We listened.
[00:31:29.563 --> 00:31:34.948]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[00:31:35.388 --> 00:31:36.769]  Again, we listened.
[00:31:37.150 --> 00:31:44.697]  Introducing the Berkey Light, the gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.
[00:31:45.177 --> 00:31:48.300]  Get the Berkey Light, the American water purifier, only $279.

[00:32:34.955 --> 00:32:36.876]  Mine found it in precious metals.
[00:32:37.576 --> 00:32:40.758]  Not paper promises, but actual gold in my possession.
[00:32:41.398 --> 00:32:47.880]  It is liquid, it is private, it owes no one, it cannot go bankrupt, and it maintains its purchasing power.

[00:33:02.302 --> 00:33:07.466]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:08.106 --> 00:33:10.448]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:33:12.509 --> 00:33:13.710]  Joe Lamas.
[00:33:15.832 --> 00:33:16.372]  Many others.
[00:33:16.412 --> 00:33:19.194]  Your calls are coming up in this hour.
[00:33:19.214 --> 00:33:20.755]  Toll-free number to join us, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:33:20.835 --> 00:33:22.556]  All right, let me continue with North Korea.
[00:33:22.576 --> 00:33:24.117]  Then we'll go to calls.
[00:33:24.137 --> 00:33:27.179]  Then I'll get into...
[00:33:31.937 --> 00:33:38.821]  The compounded... I mean, it's like adding nitrous oxide to a race car.
[00:33:39.381 --> 00:33:53.488]  What's happening with this Foley scandal, that makes the politicians that much more cornered, that much more dangerous, needing some type of new distraction or diversion if this scandal gets to the point of endangering the administration.
[00:33:53.809 --> 00:34:00.172]  We know the administration, who are just high-level functionaries and servants, frontmen, figureheads, puppets...
[00:34:01.148 --> 00:34:01.548]  I think?
[00:34:27.435 --> 00:34:30.438]  I think they were planning it for later, maybe even a year later.
[00:34:50.794 --> 00:34:58.162]  That they launched it prematurely because of the trillions missing from the Pentagon and that breaking big for about a day.
[00:34:58.182 --> 00:35:00.024]  Then they artificially suppressed it.
[00:35:00.324 --> 00:35:03.227]  It was still leaking out, and the 9-11 took place.
[00:35:03.868 --> 00:35:05.249]  But again, side issue.
[00:35:05.289 --> 00:35:07.151]  Let's get back into the news.
[00:35:07.432 --> 00:35:11.236]  Let me just read some of what Paul Watson wrote about this today up on...
[00:35:13.604 --> 00:35:26.873]  PrisonPlanet.com, North Korea nuke test derails Iran invasion as Rami's madcap dictator arming resulted in a blowback that undermines the neocon war machine.
[00:35:28.294 --> 00:35:29.335]  And that could be the case.
[00:35:29.415 --> 00:35:35.058]  I mean, North Korea could be genuinely trying to escalate into World War III.
[00:35:35.739 --> 00:35:41.803]  Kim Jong-il is a 4'9 Napoleon complex hereditary psychopathic dictator.
[00:35:42.990 --> 00:35:46.813]  Never a good sign when your president is the son of a former president.
[00:35:47.733 --> 00:35:51.356]  Never a good sign when the dictator is the son of the dictator.
[00:35:51.916 --> 00:35:53.197]  Oh boy, you're in trouble.
[00:35:54.018 --> 00:36:02.564]  North Korea's underground atomic weapons test is a wild card that could potentially derail the neocon battle plan to carry out airstrikes on Iran.
[00:36:03.476 --> 00:36:14.599]  Will the myopic hubris of the Bushists make them blind to the incompatibility of selling a war on a nation years away from nukes while another openly proliferates?
[00:36:14.979 --> 00:36:19.360]  Or could it just make the likelihood of a false flag terror attack more likely?
[00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:27.782]  Russia is now saying that the test was far greater than first reported in the region of 5,000 tons, or 15,000 tons, of TNT.
[00:36:32.489 --> 00:36:38.033]  An upper limit which would put it on par with the bomb dropped on Hiroshima in 1945.
[00:36:38.933 --> 00:36:41.695]  It goes on.
[00:36:41.715 --> 00:36:45.057]  This had to be 5 to 15 megatons.
[00:36:45.898 --> 00:36:50.921]  Reports concerning developments in North Korea's nuclear program are routinely absent.
[00:36:51.561 --> 00:36:55.764]  The memory hold fact that it was Donald Rumsfeld, former...
[00:36:56.639 --> 00:37:06.447]  Non-executive director of ABB that signed off on a $200 million contract to sell nuclear reactors to the Stalinist state in November of 2000.
[00:37:06.727 --> 00:37:17.355]  Has Rumsfeld's wanton act of chaos-mongering resulted in a form of blowback that could eviscerate the entire roadmap of his administration?
[00:37:18.496 --> 00:37:20.758]  Or, I would add...
[00:37:22.145 --> 00:37:31.355]  Could he have made a deal back in 96 that when they needed a diversion, old Kim Jong-il would light off an A-bomb or two?
[00:37:32.436 --> 00:37:39.604]  How does this test affect the global and domestic propaganda campaign to justify airstrikes on Iran?
[00:37:40.487 --> 00:37:45.590]  Mike Rivera, what really happened, reckons North Korea has put the screws to any U.S.
[00:37:45.670 --> 00:37:46.190]  invasion.
[00:37:46.511 --> 00:37:56.737]  Quote, it will be hard for Bush to sell an invasion of Iran because it might someday make nuclear weapons with North Korea, definitely has them now.
[00:37:59.358 --> 00:38:08.944]  Bush has to attack North Korea before Iran, and who will support an attack on a nation that actually has nuclear weapons of mass destruction?
[00:38:10.208 --> 00:38:10.688]  That's right.
[00:38:10.708 --> 00:38:16.672]  You've got to pick on some backwater that doesn't have the weapons, while lying to your mindless population that they do.
[00:38:17.232 --> 00:38:24.696]  This makes a lone Israeli attack the more likely scenario in Iran, but there is no doubt it will be backed by covert U.S.
[00:38:24.716 --> 00:38:27.098]  support and a huge domestic distraction.
[00:38:27.598 --> 00:38:36.663]  Fox News seemingly welcomed the nuke test as beneficial for the Bush administration in that it was the only story capable of knocking Foleygate off the air.
[00:38:38.530 --> 00:38:42.172]  Never mind the tremendous implications of this.
[00:38:42.672 --> 00:38:48.535]  It's all about GOP politics all the time on Fox News, writes newshounds.
[00:38:50.436 --> 00:38:54.739]  And Fox continues, as well as AP, claiming that Foley is a Democrat.
[00:38:55.499 --> 00:39:03.043]  And, of course, ESPN puts in fake cheering at the Superdome in New Orleans two weeks ago when Bush Sr.
[00:39:03.103 --> 00:39:03.624]  is there.
[00:39:03.644 --> 00:39:06.185]  I mean, we've entered total propaganda, my friends.
[00:39:07.964 --> 00:39:25.582]  The world has been made infinitely more dangerous due not to the sufficiently increased danger posed by Kim Jong Il, but because the Bush regime has to go to even greater lengths to sell an attack on a nation 10 to 15 years away from producing a bomb.
[00:39:26.218 --> 00:39:36.565]  The neo-fascists are more desperate than ever to manufacture a false flag event that can propel Iran back above North Korea in the fear stakes.
[00:39:37.246 --> 00:39:46.833]  Watch for a Rovian rhetoric to be shifted from Iran's pursuit of nuclear technology to their alleged support of terrorists in Lebanon and Iraq.
[00:39:47.373 --> 00:39:55.936]  Also, Israel is now coming out in the Jerusalem Post saying they think North Korea may have given or could give a nuke to Iran.
[00:39:55.996 --> 00:39:59.877]  So we better go ahead and hit Iran so North Korea can't give them one.
[00:40:00.417 --> 00:40:01.577]  That makes a lot of sense.
[00:40:01.597 --> 00:40:03.098]  Let's not hit North Korea.
[00:40:03.138 --> 00:40:07.319]  Let's hit Iran as if that could stop North Korea from giving them one.
[00:40:07.599 --> 00:40:12.941]  And then ignoring the fact that our own government ensured that North Korea got the weapons and the delivery systems.
[00:40:14.401 --> 00:40:16.082]  And then kept it out of U.S.
[00:40:16.142 --> 00:40:16.802]  newspapers
[00:40:18.158 --> 00:40:21.780]  Six years ago, when North Korea hit the U.S.
[00:40:21.800 --> 00:40:24.722]  with a test Taepung Dong-2 missile, hit Alaska.
[00:40:26.563 --> 00:40:27.144]  Unbelievable.
[00:40:27.184 --> 00:40:32.927]  Kim Jong-il may be a mentally unstable lunatic, but he's not short of geopolitical understanding.
[00:40:33.848 --> 00:40:41.453]  He knows that the Bush war machine only targets defenseless tin pot dictators and leaves real members of the nuclear club alone.
[00:40:42.051 --> 00:40:59.165]  But his actions have greased the skids for a desperate lunge on the part of the Straussians that most likely outcome being a huge attack on Jerusalem or Tel Aviv blamed on Iranian-backed Hezbollah providing the Israelis with a UN mandate to retaliate.
[00:41:01.207 --> 00:41:07.953]  That would stifle the voices of enough critics to ratchet up the Armageddon meter one more notch.
[00:41:08.894 --> 00:41:10.235]  Paul's done a good report here.
[00:41:11.432 --> 00:41:14.274]  He links to some analysts that think they'll probably attack Israel.
[00:41:14.294 --> 00:41:15.975]  And I've said that's in the cards.
[00:41:16.475 --> 00:41:17.435]  Israel could get hit.
[00:41:17.716 --> 00:41:20.397]  The Temple Mount could get blown up and vaporized.
[00:41:20.457 --> 00:41:23.659]  That would open the door for things to start moving ahead, wouldn't it?
[00:41:24.519 --> 00:41:30.282]  For the global agenda of the new world leader who will save us from World War III.
[00:41:32.363 --> 00:41:33.704]  And that's what the neocons are saying.
[00:41:33.724 --> 00:41:34.905]  That's what the globalists are saying.
[00:41:35.045 --> 00:41:40.728]  Out of a world war, out of a final world war, they will get their one world government.
[00:41:41.815 --> 00:41:43.316]  And that isn't revelation, folks.
[00:41:43.416 --> 00:41:44.276]  That's the U.N.
[00:41:44.316 --> 00:41:44.817]  documents.
[00:41:45.177 --> 00:41:46.798]  That's the Rockefeller Brothers documents.
[00:41:47.038 --> 00:41:48.359]  That's the Carnegie documents.
[00:41:48.739 --> 00:41:55.302]  That's what the Supreme Grand Commander of this crew said back in 1876, Albert Pike.
[00:41:56.063 --> 00:41:57.604]  And that's what they're setting up.
[00:41:57.664 --> 00:41:59.145]  And I don't know what the brakes will be.
[00:41:59.705 --> 00:42:00.725]  I don't know exactly.
[00:42:01.766 --> 00:42:03.987]  Last time I saw that, I got an email that said, what does that mean?
[00:42:04.007 --> 00:42:05.088]  I don't know what the brakes will be.
[00:42:05.108 --> 00:42:07.089]  That's a pool term, I guess.
[00:42:08.035 --> 00:42:18.761]  Correct me if I'm wrong, but when you slam the ball into the racked balls, you don't know exactly where they're going to go is my point.
[00:42:19.161 --> 00:42:22.483]  But we know that the ball is being hit.
[00:42:23.003 --> 00:42:35.190]  We know that it's already exploding towards the racked balls and the all-important eight ball that we're all behind right now.
[00:42:35.956 --> 00:42:37.937]  Boy, that is a really disgusting analogy.
[00:42:37.957 --> 00:42:43.781]  And by disgusting, I mean it's just the hyperbole is out of control here.
[00:42:44.621 --> 00:42:47.123]  But we are living in the time that tries men's souls.
[00:42:48.084 --> 00:42:50.005]  Heaping cliche on top of cliche.
[00:42:50.645 --> 00:42:51.446]  Why stop there?
[00:42:52.126 --> 00:42:56.089]  I mean, we are in very serious times right now.
[00:42:57.069 --> 00:43:01.592]  And it just gets worse and worse by the minute.
[00:43:02.268 --> 00:43:11.698]  Bill Clinton ordered the FBI under W1999 to back off Hamas, to back off Al-Qaeda, to back off AQ Khan Laboratories.
[00:43:12.098 --> 00:43:18.565]  George Bush reauthorized it in late January as soon as he got into office.
[00:43:18.605 --> 00:43:22.089]  That's been in the foreign news, BBC, Reuters.
[00:43:23.915 --> 00:43:45.200]  Ordering FBI to leave AQ Khan Laboratories alone, ordering the CIA to leave AQ Khan Laboratories alone, who gave the nukes, developed the nukes and the medium-range missiles to Pakistan, who in turn, through AQ Khan Laboratories, gave it to North Korea, then Rumsfeld swooped in and gave them the reactors for the fissile material, i.e.
[00:43:47.061 --> 00:43:50.281]  the uranium, the plutonium, and now here we are.
[00:43:51.702 --> 00:43:53.082]  And the border stays wide open.
[00:43:53.829 --> 00:44:03.694]  But that's not going to stop a snot-nosed cop from pulling you over and when you say, search my car without a warrant, you've got to have a warrant.
[00:44:03.734 --> 00:44:08.416]  And they're telling everybody I've talked to, we're in a post-9-11 world.
[00:44:09.677 --> 00:44:12.538]  I need to look for drugs.
[00:44:12.578 --> 00:44:13.899]  Just come on.
[00:44:14.419 --> 00:44:15.679]  Tell somebody who cares.
[00:44:15.940 --> 00:44:18.241]  Go tell somebody else that buys it, okay?
[00:44:19.061 --> 00:44:20.762]  This government's totally criminal.
[00:44:21.282 --> 00:44:22.963]  The whole system's gone corrupt.
[00:44:23.817 --> 00:44:32.361]  And literally, my friends, my head spins trying to think of ways to express it.
[00:44:32.381 --> 00:44:41.546]  You know, I had a couple of people running my new syndicated show through MS Communications, via Genesis Communications, that I do on Sunday nights from 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:44:41.586 --> 00:44:41.966]  Central.
[00:44:42.647 --> 00:44:48.850]  And I got a new guy in there who, you know, just working the phones, and you got the fellow who runs the actual board.
[00:44:48.870 --> 00:44:51.211]  There's actually three people up there last night, but...
[00:44:52.526 --> 00:44:53.927]  Again, I always belabor it.
[00:44:53.967 --> 00:44:57.988]  The point is, I always give too many details.
[00:44:58.408 --> 00:44:58.948]  It doesn't matter.
[00:44:59.428 --> 00:45:09.712]  There's a new guy up there, and at the end he says, you've got a really entertaining show, but I think you take real things and exaggerate them, and just somehow I can't believe what you're saying.
[00:45:09.732 --> 00:45:11.873]  And I said, okay, here's all my news articles.
[00:45:13.031 --> 00:45:14.072]  What do you not believe?
[00:45:14.152 --> 00:45:19.175]  Well, that thing about Google listening with microphones on your computers, I just can't believe it.
[00:45:19.576 --> 00:45:21.397]  And I said, but here's the Registered Newspaper.
[00:45:21.437 --> 00:45:22.558]  Here's Google's own website.
[00:45:22.578 --> 00:45:24.159]  See, these are hyperlinks.
[00:45:24.579 --> 00:45:27.061]  Using the microphones on your computer, they say they're going to listen to you.
[00:45:28.001 --> 00:45:29.702]  And he just goes, oh, they can't do that.
[00:45:29.742 --> 00:45:30.603]  I just can't believe it.
[00:45:31.023 --> 00:45:34.185]  And I said, but I'm not making it up.
[00:45:34.225 --> 00:45:36.567]  He said, still, I think you're exaggerating.
[00:45:38.109 --> 00:45:40.170]  Folks, I wish I was exaggerating.
[00:45:40.290 --> 00:45:40.691]  I'm not.
[00:45:40.731 --> 00:45:42.892]  And you can go read the article and find out I'm not.
[00:45:44.113 --> 00:46:07.127]  I don't have words to describe how Orwellian it is, how horrible it is, how bad it is, how far down the slippery slope towards total surveillance we've gone, that they just openly announced we're going to use microphones built into computers to use AI keyword recognition to just listen to everyone without a warrant, and private industry is going to do it, and they just announce it.
[00:46:09.225 --> 00:46:11.866]  I can't get over how big that is.
[00:46:13.386 --> 00:46:16.067]  But again, America on average is in denial.
[00:46:16.407 --> 00:46:23.469]  People tune in here, even a lot of our regular listeners, they go, well, he's right about a lot of stuff and I listen, but, you know, it's not as bad as he says.
[00:46:23.549 --> 00:46:26.250]  No, it's worse than what I'm saying, okay?
[00:46:28.991 --> 00:46:33.952]  I mean, it's hard to believe that many of our world leaders like to rape and kill children, but they do.
[00:46:35.518 --> 00:46:40.341]  The evidence from the Netherlands and Italy and France and Germany and England and the U.S.
[00:46:40.361 --> 00:46:40.721]  was in.
[00:46:41.421 --> 00:46:48.205]  Mainstream article after mainstream article where they dig up all the dead bodies of toddlers or they dig up all the dead bodies of women.
[00:46:48.906 --> 00:46:54.269]  And the media will focus in on some independent groups, some Charlie Manson groups, some Jeffrey Dahmer groups.
[00:46:54.509 --> 00:47:01.993]  But when it's an elitist killing, it's just, well, 12 skeletons were dug up of children on the royal family's property in the Netherlands.
[00:47:02.113 --> 00:47:03.294]  It's being kept quiet.
[00:47:03.374 --> 00:47:04.535]  Oh, that's the end of story.
[00:47:05.959 --> 00:47:09.360]  In Belgium, they supply the children, the bunch of dead toddlers they found.
[00:47:09.680 --> 00:47:12.001]  It's admitted they were supplied to judges and the royalty.
[00:47:12.021 --> 00:47:16.263]  You know, I didn't make that up.
[00:47:16.323 --> 00:47:16.883]  That's true.
[00:47:16.903 --> 00:47:23.806]  You know, we didn't make up the Army report admitting they raped children and they used acid on people in their orifices.
[00:47:24.626 --> 00:47:24.986]  Okay?
[00:47:25.446 --> 00:47:27.807]  I have trouble believing that as a normal person.
[00:47:28.207 --> 00:47:32.889]  I'm like, my gosh, there are people running things that pour acid on people.
[00:47:34.952 --> 00:47:37.053]  You know, I'm sorry it's so horrible.
[00:47:38.073 --> 00:48:00.122]  And I'm sorry, listen, I'm sorry that I'm just some, you know, somebody who just comes from farmer and roughneck and rancher stock from Texas who found out about one world government 14 years ago, who got on the air almost 13 years ago, and who decided I was going to try to fight this stuff, and I can't believe what I've gotten myself into.
[00:48:00.983 --> 00:48:03.284]  And I'm sorry that I'm one of the big kahunas.
[00:48:03.384 --> 00:48:04.064]  I don't like it.
[00:48:05.214 --> 00:48:06.614]  I'd like to take off more time.
[00:48:06.674 --> 00:48:07.955]  I'd like to be doing other things.
[00:48:10.156 --> 00:48:11.756]  I wish I was more articulate.
[00:48:11.816 --> 00:48:13.097]  I wish I did a better job.
[00:48:14.557 --> 00:48:16.898]  I wish I was a better manager of my operation.
[00:48:17.818 --> 00:48:19.959]  I don't like the fact that it's fallen to me.
[00:48:20.299 --> 00:48:22.880]  Just like you don't like the fact that it's fallen to you to fight this thing.
[00:48:23.100 --> 00:48:25.861]  And a lot of you say, well, I wouldn't do a perfect job, or I'm not a leader.
[00:48:26.121 --> 00:48:27.641]  Hey, hey, listen, necessity.
[00:48:29.702 --> 00:48:33.623]  Necessity is the root of invention.
[00:48:34.637 --> 00:48:35.878]  Isn't that the saying?
[00:48:36.478 --> 00:48:37.019]  And it is.
[00:48:38.800 --> 00:48:40.621]  I mean, listen, you don't have a choice.
[00:48:40.681 --> 00:48:41.582]  You've got to be a leader.
[00:48:43.483 --> 00:48:46.005]  I can't believe the weird nightmare we woke up to.
[00:48:46.205 --> 00:48:54.611]  And you can try to live in denial and tell yourself it isn't this bad and tell yourself it isn't scary and tell yourself they didn't overturn the Bill of Rights two Fridays ago.
[00:48:56.832 --> 00:48:58.433]  But it doesn't make it so.
[00:48:59.434 --> 00:49:01.015]  It doesn't make the truth go away.
[00:49:04.389 --> 00:49:09.872]  And I know I come off as arrogant sometimes.
[00:49:10.092 --> 00:49:10.812]  It's not arrogance.
[00:49:10.852 --> 00:49:11.773]  It's aggressiveness.
[00:49:13.254 --> 00:49:26.000]  It's somebody who's sad about what's happening, and somebody who's upset about what's happening, and somebody who's freaked out about what's happening, gutting up every day for three hours, getting fired up to make myself focus in on all this.
[00:49:28.604 --> 00:49:41.915]  And I have a great frustration that, you know, when I'm off air, I can think about all the facets and understand the New World Order and really see it and have all these incredibly complex, important thoughts, and I get on air and you try to put that information together with the speech.
[00:49:42.155 --> 00:49:43.276]  You know, we do a pretty good job.
[00:49:43.316 --> 00:49:44.257]  I'm not knocking myself.
[00:49:44.557 --> 00:49:47.580]  It's just I want you to know that you can't count on me to get the job done.
[00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:50.362]  All of you have to be leaders and get involved in this fight.
[00:49:50.382 --> 00:49:54.646]  We're going to go to break and come back, and I promise go straight to your calls.
[00:49:56.005 --> 00:50:06.509]  Before we do that, Google Video has responded and admitted that they did again last week delete the ratings for... We're going to be posting their response.
[00:50:06.809 --> 00:50:10.710]  They did delete Terror Storm's ratings on Google Video.
[00:50:12.010 --> 00:50:19.133]  And again, we're not here trying to win the poll at the Indy 500.
[00:50:19.173 --> 00:50:20.633]  It isn't, oh, I want my trophy.
[00:50:22.474 --> 00:50:22.974]  It's that...
[00:50:23.969 --> 00:50:35.619]  Once it goes into the top 100 and stays in the top 100, more people see it, and then the film can go supernova, like Loose Change and other great documentaries, and then we can turn this thing around and expose government-sponsored terror.
[00:50:36.760 --> 00:50:40.322]  But for a second time, Google admits they claim it's an accident, though.
[00:50:42.184 --> 00:50:43.685]  They're not doing it to other videos.
[00:50:44.206 --> 00:50:45.867]  They're doing it to terror storms.
[00:50:46.574 --> 00:50:47.796]  Ask yourselves why.
[00:50:48.237 --> 00:50:52.222]  Get it on DVD at Infowars.com and spread it to the four winds.
[00:50:52.242 --> 00:50:55.507]  It's on Google Video right now for you.
[00:50:56.388 --> 00:50:57.189]  We'll be right back.
[00:50:57.510 --> 00:50:58.051]  Stay with us.
[00:51:04.796 --> 00:51:07.977]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[00:51:08.317 --> 00:51:10.237]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[00:51:10.637 --> 00:51:18.279]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:18.979 --> 00:51:26.020]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:51:26.421 --> 00:51:29.341]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran.
[00:51:29.741 --> 00:51:32.062]  A White House program to disseminate fake news.
[00:51:32.482 --> 00:51:33.302]  NSA spies.
[00:51:33.872 --> 00:51:35.213]  Or by calling toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[00:51:35.233 --> 00:51:37.135]  Or watch it right now online at prisonplanet.tv.
[00:52:01.505 --> 00:52:02.205]  Hello, folks.
[00:52:02.225 --> 00:52:09.067]  This is Alex Jones introducing you to the incredible Berkey Solar Charger, your source for free solar electricity.
[00:52:09.307 --> 00:52:16.428]  This portable system is the size of a book when folded and small enough to fit into a briefcase, handbag, or glove compartment.
[00:52:16.548 --> 00:52:28.091]  The Berkey Solar Charger has been designed to power the Berkey lights, LED lamps, as well as other applications such as mobile phones, radios, digital cameras, and PDAs when electricity is unavailable.
[00:52:28.471 --> 00:52:29.991]  It's multi-voltage capability
[00:52:29.991 --> 00:52:30.651]  We're good to go.
[00:53:01.572 --> 00:53:09.499]  For years, you've been hearing about Herbal Healer Academy and how it's remained a leader in effective alternative and natural medicine and education.
[00:53:09.960 --> 00:53:13.123]  But how can they continue to hold that title for years on end?

[00:53:56.672 --> 00:54:00.074]  HerbalHealer.com Working with the power of nature.
[00:54:04.396 --> 00:54:10.419]  From his Central Texas Command Center deep behind enemy lines the information war continues.
[00:54:11.039 --> 00:54:13.961]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:17.205 --> 00:54:24.812]  Even Limbaugh and Grudge are having to backtrack on their defense of Foley as more and more comes out.
[00:54:26.293 --> 00:54:37.662]  And believe me, this is just the first little inklings of a much larger scandal that we've been documenting here for years.
[00:54:37.682 --> 00:54:44.348]  And it's hard to believe that there's a guild of perverts working together that have seized control of government
[00:54:45.459 --> 00:54:48.321]  But really, if you study history, that's pretty normal.
[00:54:48.741 --> 00:54:55.946]  It takes sickos who have horrible taste to go and do these type of evil things.
[00:54:58.728 --> 00:55:02.831]  I mean, people don't stop with just stealing trillions of dollars from pension funds.
[00:55:02.851 --> 00:55:04.673]  They don't stop with overturning the Bill of Rights.
[00:55:04.693 --> 00:55:07.775]  They don't stop with those types of crimes and sins.
[00:55:08.275 --> 00:55:09.476]  They sample them all.
[00:55:10.862 --> 00:55:19.008]  And so for normal people, it's hard for us to imagine and get our brains around this, and that's why we have been enslaved throughout history, because we're naive.
[00:55:19.929 --> 00:55:24.272]  So coming up, we'll get into that, a bunch of Iraq news, there's just so much today.
[00:55:24.652 --> 00:55:26.574]  I haven't covered half the North Korean news.
[00:55:28.135 --> 00:55:35.360]  We'll go to Job, then Lance, Scott, KC, and who's in Mississippi?
[00:55:36.852 --> 00:55:37.933]  Lamas and many others.
[00:55:38.433 --> 00:55:40.215]  Joe in Wisconsin, you're on the air.
[00:55:40.275 --> 00:55:40.735]  Go ahead.
[00:55:41.116 --> 00:55:41.656]  Hi, Alex.
[00:55:41.776 --> 00:55:43.978]  Hey, I want you to know I got your back.
[00:55:44.518 --> 00:55:50.143]  As far as this Korean thing, though, I think it makes a horrible, terrible distraction.
[00:55:50.423 --> 00:55:55.407]  And I mean that in the scope and the magnitude, not the, oh, they're just bluffing.
[00:55:55.447 --> 00:55:56.849]  No, I don't think they're bluffing.
[00:55:57.189 --> 00:55:59.871]  But I think that we're being distracted from the real issues.
[00:56:00.211 --> 00:56:00.912]  I think we've got
[00:56:01.645 --> 00:56:07.732]  A bunch of tyrannical bullies in our government, and we need to take and fight back for our Constitution.
[00:56:08.092 --> 00:56:12.056]  Because if that goes, hiding in the corner isn't going to help.
[00:56:12.717 --> 00:56:14.479]  For God's sakes, people, figure this out.
[00:56:14.659 --> 00:56:19.144]  If you act more and more like a sheep, they're the first ones that get taken out.
[00:56:19.464 --> 00:56:21.066]  They're the ones, hmm, easy pickings.
[00:56:21.626 --> 00:56:24.229]  And there's a friend of mine, God love him, but
[00:56:24.901 --> 00:56:31.352]  He is ignorant enough to think that if he just leaves the evil bee and just goes about his business, they won't come for him.
[00:56:31.753 --> 00:56:33.456]  Oh, they're the first ones to go!
[00:56:33.476 --> 00:56:34.618]  The first!
[00:56:35.754 --> 00:56:41.919]  They've already come for you in your water, in the air, in what they teach your children, in the society.
[00:56:42.379 --> 00:56:46.682]  But no one knows CPS is grabbing your neighbor's children because you don't know your neighbor.
[00:56:47.082 --> 00:56:52.686]  Nobody knows that cancer is up a couple thousand percentage points on average because people don't read statistics.
[00:56:53.086 --> 00:56:55.708]  People don't know that we're totally falling apart.
[00:56:56.269 --> 00:56:57.269]  It's learned hopelessness.
[00:56:57.309 --> 00:57:00.912]  They want to make sure that we know there's nothing that we can do.
[00:57:01.761 --> 00:57:04.344]  And I talked about a Constitutional Action Day.
[00:57:04.704 --> 00:57:17.576]  I think some of the smartest things we could do is to get a bunch of petitions together and send them all to Tom Tancredo, Ron Paul, and I forget who the other congressman is, but get it on paper.
[00:57:17.696 --> 00:57:21.180]  We want a constitutional challenge to this H.R.
[00:57:21.200 --> 00:57:21.180]  6166.
[00:57:21.320 --> 00:57:23.261]  I agree.
[00:57:23.622 --> 00:57:24.683]  I appreciate your call.
[00:57:25.343 --> 00:57:26.705]  We need to repeal...
[00:57:28.787 --> 00:57:29.188]  H.R.
[00:57:29.208 --> 00:57:34.453]  6166, that's the House version that passed two weeks ago that Bush signed last week.
[00:57:35.634 --> 00:57:40.238]  We need to get that overturned and get that overturned now.
[00:57:41.059 --> 00:57:46.584]  And Paul Watson and I wrote a big article calling for that to happen a week ago.
[00:57:47.965 --> 00:57:51.769]  And it is imperative that this happen.
[00:57:52.169 --> 00:57:53.811]  But that comes through education.
[00:57:54.446 --> 00:57:58.548]  And you're right, that on the heels of that passing, the Foley scandal broke.
[00:57:58.669 --> 00:58:02.191]  On the heels of it passing, we now have the North Korea situation.
[00:58:04.072 --> 00:58:04.892]  It is huge.
[00:58:04.992 --> 00:58:09.015]  This is the equivalent of the anti-1776.
[00:58:10.876 --> 00:58:14.998]  What happened, to be technical, I guess a week and a half ago.
[00:58:16.119 --> 00:58:17.940]  Not this last Friday, but the Friday before last.
[00:58:19.025 --> 00:58:22.027]  We need to make sure that this story has a life on the Internet.
[00:58:22.347 --> 00:58:24.468]  We need to make sure the people are educated.
[00:58:24.748 --> 00:58:30.091]  We need to continue to write articles about it, to send emails about it, to make sure it's a front and center issue.
[00:58:31.412 --> 00:58:31.852]  All right.
[00:58:32.472 --> 00:58:35.654]  We'll come back in 70 seconds and start the second hour.
[00:58:36.775 --> 00:58:37.575]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:58:37.595 --> 00:58:39.076]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
[00:58:41.937 --> 00:58:46.160]  Order a copy of this show for your friends and family at GCNlive.com or call 877-300-7645.
[00:58:56.571 --> 00:58:57.211]  Big Brother.
[00:58:57.872 --> 00:58:58.932]  Mainstream media.
[00:58:59.653 --> 00:59:00.793]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:01.414 --> 00:59:02.274]  You want answers?
[00:59:02.995 --> 00:59:03.855]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:03.875 --> 00:59:08.337]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:08.718 --> 00:59:12.860]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:18.043 --> 00:59:19.344]  Welcome back, my friends.
[00:59:19.444 --> 00:59:21.765]  We are now into the second hour of
[00:59:23.072 --> 00:59:26.353]  Of this October 9th, 2006 edition.
[00:59:28.314 --> 00:59:38.417]  Obviously, a lot of you are wanting to get my take and wanting to hear other people's take and analysis of North Korea's A-bomb test.
[00:59:39.237 --> 00:59:40.977]  They were first saying it was a small test.
[00:59:41.037 --> 00:59:49.720]  Now it's coming out that it was a moderately large test, similar to the bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima.
[00:59:51.989 --> 00:59:53.110]  Very, very serious.
[00:59:55.572 --> 01:00:11.163]  And now the neocons are having a problem because they've been trying to talk about how the ultimate threat in the galaxy is Iran, who is conservatively nine years away if they had everything given to them they need from producing primitive nuclear weapons.
[01:00:13.264 --> 01:00:14.465]  And they don't have a delivery system.
[01:00:15.535 --> 01:00:24.640]  But North Korea has fired a test missile that in 2000 hit the United States, hit Alaska, but was never in our news, all over foreign press.
[01:00:26.101 --> 01:00:27.602]  North Korea, of course, bragged about it.
[01:00:27.622 --> 01:00:28.703]  They're quite proud of themselves.
[01:00:31.544 --> 01:00:32.385]  A dummy missile.
[01:00:32.405 --> 01:00:37.448]  It did break up on reentry, but pieces of it did hit our country.
[01:00:39.312 --> 01:00:42.295]  And the media kept that quiet because they don't want to go after North Korea.
[01:00:42.816 --> 01:01:00.895]  No, they want to go after Iraq and Afghanistan and Iran and all these places where they have trillions of dollars of oil and where they can have nice little staged wars like Vietnam that are designed not to be won, but to go on for decades, hundreds of billions in weapon sales and no-bid contracts per year.
[01:01:01.593 --> 01:01:05.934]  So we'll recap and get into some of the info we haven't covered yet on North Korea.
[01:01:06.114 --> 01:01:08.355]  But first, I want to get through all these calls I've been patiently holding.
[01:01:08.675 --> 01:01:11.015]  We'll get into all the new information coming out on Foley.
[01:01:11.055 --> 01:01:12.356]  This is really getting serious.
[01:01:13.296 --> 01:01:17.537]  And it's important because it puts the neocons back up against the wall and makes them that much more dangerous.
[01:01:17.817 --> 01:01:19.117]  Or I wouldn't even be talking about this.
[01:01:19.177 --> 01:01:21.658]  It'd be a distraction if it wasn't for that fact.
[01:01:23.058 --> 01:01:24.879]  And several other big stacks of important news.
[01:01:25.379 --> 01:01:29.320]  Let's go to Lamas in Mississippi.
[01:01:29.740 --> 01:01:30.440]  You're on the air.
[01:01:30.480 --> 01:01:31.140]  Thanks for holding.
[01:01:32.067 --> 01:01:34.448]  I think it's Lamar, not Lamar.
[01:01:34.588 --> 01:01:36.089]  Okay, well they told me it was Lamas.
[01:01:36.109 --> 01:01:37.610]  I thought that was a different name.
[01:01:38.210 --> 01:01:40.411]  Maybe it's because your phone is a little bit distorted.
[01:01:40.451 --> 01:01:40.891]  Go ahead.
[01:01:41.371 --> 01:01:44.373]  This thing is grossly overlooked.
[01:01:44.873 --> 01:01:53.417]  Anybody know how out of the way it is for them to truck China's goods to Mexico or to Canada?
[01:01:53.557 --> 01:01:54.197]  It's 36 miles.
[01:01:55.398 --> 01:02:00.520]  You've got to look at all those containers north and east.
[01:02:01.138 --> 01:02:05.779]  I mean, everybody's... Sir, do you want a cordless phone?
[01:02:06.699 --> 01:02:07.059]  Yes, sir.
[01:02:08.180 --> 01:02:09.120]  It's unintelligible.
[01:02:09.920 --> 01:02:11.861]  Is there any way you can get closer to the jack?
[01:02:13.021 --> 01:02:15.501]  Does that help you right there?
[01:02:17.102 --> 01:02:19.562]  I heard... Did you say, did that help me?
[01:02:19.582 --> 01:02:21.643]  I was going to just...
[01:02:23.005 --> 01:02:25.667]  Folks, everybody should get rid of their... I appreciate your call.
[01:02:25.687 --> 01:02:26.447]  I've got to let you go.
[01:02:27.027 --> 01:02:27.748]  I'm really sorry.
[01:02:28.628 --> 01:02:30.469]  Let's go ahead and talk to Lance in Texas.
[01:02:30.509 --> 01:02:31.229]  Lance, go ahead.
[01:02:32.550 --> 01:02:32.890]  Hi, Alex.
[01:02:33.150 --> 01:02:33.411]  Yes, sir.
[01:02:33.431 --> 01:02:33.771]  Go ahead.
[01:02:34.291 --> 01:02:44.956]  Alex, I moved to Austin about 10 years ago, and I was one of those people that used to flip through the channels 10 years ago and see you on public access, and I used to make fun of you back then.
[01:02:46.397 --> 01:02:50.639]  And I guess I can't really do that anymore because a lot of the things that you were talking about
[01:02:51.178 --> 01:02:53.159]  Back then, or what's happening today?
[01:02:53.780 --> 01:02:59.203]  Well, unfortunately, ten years from now, we won't be sitting here talking if this continues, sir.
[01:02:59.223 --> 01:03:02.204]  A lot of us will be in FEMA camps.
[01:03:02.244 --> 01:03:03.425]  A lot of us will be in prisons.
[01:03:03.465 --> 01:03:06.067]  We'll be in also government work camps for our safety.
[01:03:06.767 --> 01:03:09.268]  And this country will be in the North American Union.
[01:03:10.149 --> 01:03:11.650]  But, sorry, go ahead and make your point.
[01:03:11.690 --> 01:03:12.650]  And I'll hold you over, too.
[01:03:12.710 --> 01:03:13.791]  I don't want to jip you on time.
[01:03:14.406 --> 01:03:18.609]  Well, actually, Alex, what I wanted to talk about was the North American Union.
[01:03:18.910 --> 01:03:19.170]  Sure.
[01:03:19.290 --> 01:03:27.016]  Now, for those of your listeners who don't believe that that's going on, they're building the hubs and the interchanges right here in Austin.
[01:03:27.857 --> 01:03:28.457]  Well, that's right.
[01:03:28.497 --> 01:03:32.541]  In fact, even people covering the North American Union keep saying they start building it next year.
[01:03:33.917 --> 01:03:34.677]  What do you mean?
[01:03:34.697 --> 01:03:41.179]  They've been building it for like five years here, the hubs, the interchanges, and they admit it here locally.
[01:03:41.219 --> 01:03:42.099]  Stay there, Lance.
[01:03:42.679 --> 01:03:45.240]  I want to let you finish up your points you're making.
[01:03:45.260 --> 01:03:45.960]  Very important.
[01:03:46.621 --> 01:03:51.422]  And I also want to get the caller's take on what's happening with North Korea and the Foley situation.
[01:03:55.564 --> 01:03:58.746]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[01:03:59.107 --> 01:04:01.048]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[01:04:01.408 --> 01:04:09.074]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:04:09.734 --> 01:04:16.799]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:04:17.219 --> 01:04:20.141]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iraq.
[01:04:20.522 --> 01:04:22.843]  A White House program to disseminate fake news.
[01:04:23.263 --> 01:04:24.084]  NSA spies.
[01:04:24.577 --> 01:04:28.660]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:04:28.920 --> 01:04:32.443]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:04:32.903 --> 01:04:34.804]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:04:35.144 --> 01:04:39.047]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:04:53.157 --> 01:04:54.117]  Good morning, honey.
[01:04:54.477 --> 01:05:00.479]  Wow, the weather is beautiful, the cabin is terrific, and it's the first day of our vacation.
[01:05:00.759 --> 01:05:01.359]  Yeah.
[01:05:01.739 --> 01:05:03.159]  Honey, is there something wrong?
[01:05:03.519 --> 01:05:06.920]  Yeah, I just realized we forgot to pack the travel burkey system.
[01:05:07.380 --> 01:05:08.881]  I can't drink this cabin water.
[01:05:09.341 --> 01:05:11.041]  And what am I going to do when I'm out on the lake?
[01:05:11.421 --> 01:05:13.202]  Now the whole vacation is ruined.
[01:05:13.402 --> 01:05:14.242]  Honey, cheer up.
[01:05:14.662 --> 01:05:16.924]  I brought our Sport Berkey purifiers.
[01:05:17.185 --> 01:05:17.505]  What?
[01:05:17.945 --> 01:05:28.435]  Yeah, I know you're picky about not having pathogenic bacteria, organic chemicals, heavy metals or foul tastes and odors in the water, so I packed our Sport Berkey purifiers.
[01:05:28.715 --> 01:05:33.540]  You know, this is a terrific cabin, and wow, have you noticed the beautiful weather?
[01:05:33.860 --> 01:05:35.061]  Don't ruin your vacation.
[01:05:35.161 --> 01:05:36.961]  Get a Travel Berkey today for only $209.
[01:05:37.001 --> 01:05:37.722]  Or get a Sport Berkey for only $39.
[01:05:37.782 --> 01:05:38.022]  Call 888-803-4438.
[01:05:38.042 --> 01:05:38.222]  That's 888-803-4438.

[01:05:39.282 --> 01:05:40.643]  Travel Berkey, not available in Iowa.
[01:05:51.894 --> 01:05:53.535]  Hello, this is Amy Bjorklund.
[01:05:53.835 --> 01:06:01.218]  Thanks to a quantum leap in garlic research, the health benefits of 20 fresh garlic cloves are now available in one tiny capsule.
[01:06:01.379 --> 01:06:09.162]  With stabilized allicin, the proven power of garlic has been transformed into what is perhaps the most important medicinal product ever developed.
[01:06:09.362 --> 01:06:10.443]  And there's no odor.
[01:06:10.703 --> 01:06:20.705]  Stabilized Allison gives you and your family a safe, natural weapon that kills harmful bacteria, viruses, and funguses, all without harming the friendly bacteria in the digestive tract.
[01:06:20.766 --> 01:06:29.008]  This means strong immunity, fewer and shorter colds, and the best possible protection from deadly diseases, none of which prescription drugs can offer.
[01:06:29.268 --> 01:06:34.829]  What's more, this product can deter mosquitoes from biting you and safely keep fleas and ticks off your pets.
[01:06:35.310 --> 01:06:43.914]  Visit truthandexcellence.com, click the Truth and Excellence banner on GCNlive.com, or call me, Amy Bjorkman, personally, at 805-595-2711.
[01:06:43.934 --> 01:06:43.974]  805-595-2711.
[01:06:53.195 --> 01:06:58.839]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:06:58.859 --> 01:07:15.630]  Continuing with wide open telephones in this hour and the next, giving you a chance to respond to the North Korean A-bomb test, giving you a chance to respond to the unfolding...
[01:07:16.787 --> 01:07:24.253]  Crisis, the Foley Crisis that threatens to overturn the GOP, giving you a chance to respond to the North American Union.
[01:07:24.974 --> 01:07:32.640]  Openly, three weeks ago, they had a secret meeting of the North American Union government with corporations, Fortune 500 in attendance.
[01:07:32.980 --> 01:07:35.602]  The public is not allowed in, and they openly say it's secret.
[01:07:36.122 --> 01:07:39.065]  I mean, it's all happening right now.
[01:07:39.485 --> 01:07:42.928]  Three carrier task forces, one steaming,
[01:07:44.255 --> 01:07:44.956]  We're good to go.
[01:07:44.976 --> 01:07:45.436]  We're good to go.
[01:08:04.629 --> 01:08:06.071]  We're good to go.
[01:08:23.684 --> 01:08:28.948]  On top of that, Iran has been trying to come to the table, trying to be friendly.
[01:08:29.309 --> 01:08:30.650]  Every time Israel or the U.S.
[01:08:30.670 --> 01:08:34.253]  threatens to attack them, they say, if you attack us, we will attack you back.
[01:08:34.273 --> 01:08:38.516]  And then they take that out of context and have Ahmadinejad saying, we will attack you.
[01:08:40.358 --> 01:08:41.258]  It's unbelievable.
[01:08:42.379 --> 01:08:47.183]  And on top of all of this, British see no evidence of arms traffic from Iran.
[01:08:47.583 --> 01:08:52.988]  British commandos combing border with Iran, finding no weapons being smuggled into Iraq.
[01:08:53.570 --> 01:08:55.311]  This is out of the Washington Post today.
[01:08:55.331 --> 01:08:57.272]  You see, I see these articles every day.
[01:08:58.472 --> 01:09:00.113]  And I'm talking to the troops, by the way.
[01:09:00.133 --> 01:09:02.454]  I'm talking to sources I have in Iraq.
[01:09:03.955 --> 01:09:06.156]  But I'll tell you who is smuggling weapons across.
[01:09:06.296 --> 01:09:06.516]  U.S.
[01:09:06.556 --> 01:09:10.458]  Special Forces for two and a half years have been attacking Iran.
[01:09:11.058 --> 01:09:11.478]  Troops.
[01:09:12.599 --> 01:09:13.559]  Not our troops anymore.
[01:09:13.659 --> 01:09:15.400]  Owned by the New World Order that owns the U.S.
[01:09:15.440 --> 01:09:17.861]  Understand, we are a captured, occupied country.
[01:09:18.516 --> 01:09:26.222]  In fact, I tell the world that the American people are to blame for letting this happen, but we are not to blame now for what this criminal system is doing.
[01:09:26.662 --> 01:09:27.823]  Our troops are brainwashed.
[01:09:27.843 --> 01:09:28.624]  They mean well.
[01:09:29.745 --> 01:09:31.146]  They work for criminal systems.
[01:09:32.027 --> 01:09:34.208]  And the American people mean well.
[01:09:34.248 --> 01:09:40.193]  We're just dumbed down and totally brainwashed by the sophisticated propaganda, though we're waking up.
[01:09:41.588 --> 01:09:46.211]  And the government's raced in with electronic voting machines to block us from being able to overturn this system.
[01:09:46.551 --> 01:09:48.293]  They blackmail and own both parties.
[01:09:49.753 --> 01:09:50.794]  It's very serious.
[01:09:52.195 --> 01:09:56.178]  But special forces have been bombing and shooting and killing and funding groups.
[01:09:57.298 --> 01:10:04.183]  Going back two and a half years ago, staging giant nationwide riots all over the country, trying to overthrow the government over there.
[01:10:07.560 --> 01:10:08.601]  Can you imagine?
[01:10:08.621 --> 01:10:19.448]  I mean, our government, this illegitimate government, is staging attacks in Iran and staging the attempted overthrow, and Ahmedinejad just lays there and takes it because they're smart.
[01:10:20.688 --> 01:10:21.529]  Can you imagine?
[01:10:21.789 --> 01:10:25.151]  Our government's blowing up dams, bombing buildings, shooting people.
[01:10:26.232 --> 01:10:30.895]  They're doing that through different terrorist groups our government openly funds in Iran.
[01:10:32.040 --> 01:10:38.504]  The others, though, Special Forces is lazing targets, picking out targets, GPS marking targets.
[01:10:38.524 --> 01:10:39.485]  They're all over the country.
[01:10:39.945 --> 01:10:42.407]  Top generals have now admitted that on CNN, by the way.
[01:10:42.927 --> 01:10:45.029]  It was Cy Hirsch two years ago first reporting it.
[01:10:45.049 --> 01:10:45.929]  All right, I'm done.
[01:10:45.949 --> 01:10:46.550]  Let's go to calls.
[01:10:46.870 --> 01:10:57.097]  We were talking to Lance in Texas, and he said, Man, ten years ago I used to see you on AXS TV and think you were a nut and laugh at you, but now everything you said is starting to come true.
[01:10:57.417 --> 01:10:59.158]  And he was bringing up the North American Union.
[01:10:59.438 --> 01:11:01.680]  Go ahead and recap what you were saying and elaborate, sir.
[01:11:02.199 --> 01:11:11.043]  Yeah, well, about ten years ago, I noticed, Alex, if you will recall, 90% of the people that called into your show back then, you had to argue with.
[01:11:12.764 --> 01:11:14.025]  Yeah, now it's kind of boring.
[01:11:14.085 --> 01:11:17.907]  Nobody really does, unless they call up and say, I'm going to kill you, or something like that.
[01:11:19.468 --> 01:11:21.529]  And back then, it used to happen to you all the time.
[01:11:22.629 --> 01:11:25.591]  Well, anyway, back to the subject of the North American Union.
[01:11:26.971 --> 01:11:29.633]  Rick Perry allegedly came up with the idea in 2003, but...
[01:11:33.052 --> 01:11:38.921]  I'd like your take on this, Alex, because I looked at the Trans-Texas Corridor map and it doesn't go to any city.
[01:11:39.502 --> 01:11:40.764]  It goes around all the cities.
[01:11:42.111 --> 01:11:49.497]  I believe, when I looked at that, that looks a lot like the UN Biodiversity Treaty introduced in 1992, or Agenda 21.
[01:11:49.577 --> 01:12:08.892]  Sure, that's exactly what I've been telling my writers, and I've been asking Paul and Steve and Schlickhausen to do a story on this, and I've been so busy I haven't had time to... What I do is I call up and I basically give them like 15 lines of info, and say, here's this article, here's that article, I instant message them the proof, then they go do more research, add more info, and then do their own writing.
[01:12:09.232 --> 01:12:11.674]  Most of the articles you see, that's where they originate from.
[01:12:12.154 --> 01:12:12.835]  That's not true.
[01:12:12.955 --> 01:12:13.835]  Half of them at least.
[01:12:13.955 --> 01:12:16.196]  But, exactly.
[01:12:16.677 --> 01:12:17.918]  Your instincts are correct.
[01:12:18.498 --> 01:12:32.186]  The biosphere, man the biosphere maps, the Agenda 21, the NAFTA highways, the Trans-Texas Corridor, all of it is simply the North American Union map.
[01:12:33.285 --> 01:12:33.785]  Thank you.
[01:12:53.846 --> 01:13:00.511]  Ninety percent of the country, and then select corporations, will then be given the property after it's taken for environmental reasons.
[01:13:01.271 --> 01:13:09.077]  The NAFTA highways, and again, at each state level, they brand it and call it state so people go along with it.
[01:13:09.117 --> 01:13:13.440]  It's like the national ID card they passed last year is going to be standardized at the state level.
[01:13:13.720 --> 01:13:18.303]  So people will argue with you, even as it's now officially an ID card, national ID card.
[01:13:18.343 --> 01:13:19.544]  They'll say, well, it says Texas.
[01:13:19.824 --> 01:13:20.925]  Well, it says Ohio.
[01:13:21.205 --> 01:13:22.266]  Well, it says Oklahoma.
[01:13:22.847 --> 01:13:27.776]  But if you go read the bill, it's federalized in federal computers, federally standardized.
[01:13:27.816 --> 01:13:29.719]  So they always give it a local name.
[01:13:30.020 --> 01:13:32.685]  Oh, look, there's a Texas on my ID.
[01:13:33.366 --> 01:13:34.849]  You see, but really it's a unit.
[01:13:35.510 --> 01:13:38.472]  A state unit and a federal unit and an international unit.
[01:13:38.792 --> 01:13:39.813]  It's been standardized.
[01:13:39.833 --> 01:13:41.514]  Going back five years ago, it was in the news.
[01:13:41.754 --> 01:13:42.754]  They had a big UN summit.
[01:13:43.114 --> 01:13:52.660]  Standardizing the international ID card with almost every country in the world with the same number of digits and the same computer systems.
[01:13:52.860 --> 01:13:54.821]  So it's not a Texas ID.
[01:13:55.121 --> 01:13:56.142]  It's not a U.S.
[01:13:56.282 --> 01:13:58.623]  ID, federal ID, national ID.
[01:13:58.984 --> 01:14:01.185]  It is your United Nations ID.
[01:14:01.685 --> 01:14:02.105]  I.D.
[01:14:02.606 --> 01:14:11.010]  And so when you go up to Oklahoma or Kansas and you see where you drive 50 miles before you can exit, you see all these ghost towns, that's what it's going to be nationwide.
[01:14:11.030 --> 01:14:12.891]  They block off all the major roads.
[01:14:13.852 --> 01:14:14.892]  You cannot exit.
[01:14:15.352 --> 01:14:18.334]  And Rick Perry's announced these roads will be self-contained.
[01:14:19.014 --> 01:14:29.840]  That's why they're in some cases several miles wide, because in the middle they build these huge medians where then select corporations bivouac and build their McDonald's and their Dutch Rochelle.
[01:14:30.595 --> 01:14:31.036]  Okay.
[01:14:31.436 --> 01:14:34.219]  So this is how they operate, sir, and this has been announced.
[01:14:34.259 --> 01:14:40.424]  So what you're seeing and thinking and saying it looks like it's one system, it is one system.
[01:14:40.444 --> 01:14:41.265]  You're absolutely right.
[01:14:41.666 --> 01:14:55.579]  Well, keep in mind also, Alex, what you may also not realize is that all of the cities that it will surround or encompass are completely dependent upon the corridor itself because oil, gas, electric...
[01:14:56.187 --> 01:14:57.708]  And then that will be the primary taxation.
[01:14:57.768 --> 01:14:59.569]  And all utilities will be built into the corridor.
[01:14:59.749 --> 01:15:00.230]  Exactly.
[01:15:00.250 --> 01:15:06.934]  It won't just be the transponder and all inspection stickers taxing you $3.85 per gallon.
[01:15:07.314 --> 01:15:08.335]  Again, that's the conversion.
[01:15:08.395 --> 01:15:10.497]  Average car travels 24 miles per gallon.
[01:15:11.637 --> 01:15:13.198]  We kept reporting $3 a gallon.
[01:15:13.499 --> 01:15:16.361]  They said about three months ago, four months ago, they said, you're wrong.
[01:15:16.661 --> 01:15:17.761]  It's $3.85.
[01:15:18.062 --> 01:15:25.086]  And then it was in the papers two weeks ago again that a trip from Austin to Dallas and back will cost $244.
[01:15:26.067 --> 01:15:27.688]  We're good to go.
[01:15:27.728 --> 01:15:28.168]  We're good to go.
[01:15:50.362 --> 01:15:57.168]  And for participation, the private companies and governments are then given large slices of it.
[01:15:57.208 --> 01:15:58.549]  This is imperialism, sir.
[01:15:58.989 --> 01:16:07.876]  So also keep in mind, if your listeners don't also realize this, that same treaty calls for a reduction in population by 66% in North America.
[01:16:08.857 --> 01:16:09.998]  And it's conservative.
[01:16:10.078 --> 01:16:18.681]  They call for 66 in most of the agreements, but in the actual treatises, 80% is conservative.
[01:16:18.701 --> 01:16:23.864]  100%, though, is becoming a large minority that insists on 100% extermination.
[01:16:24.444 --> 01:16:28.146]  That is now the majority view at UT under Pianca.
[01:16:28.246 --> 01:16:32.667]  He has been unseated and is seen as a liberal because he only wants 90% eradication.
[01:16:34.167 --> 01:16:37.749]  So I'd like to recommend a film for some of your listeners here.
[01:16:37.869 --> 01:16:42.572]  One of the things that kind of summarizes this really well, Alex, and the film is 10 years old.
[01:16:43.153 --> 01:16:47.456]  They can go to Google Video and watch a film by Eagle Forum called Global Governance.
[01:16:48.176 --> 01:16:51.198]  And that's very informative on this particular subject.
[01:16:52.399 --> 01:16:54.020]  Well, you know, my next film is about this.
[01:16:54.924 --> 01:16:55.324]  Oh, it is.
[01:16:57.405 --> 01:16:58.466]  We're in a race against time.
[01:16:58.486 --> 01:16:59.726]  I don't want to put out crap.
[01:17:00.187 --> 01:17:05.009]  Excuse my French, but I want to... I need to have higher standards.
[01:17:05.049 --> 01:17:06.630]  I apologize for using that term.
[01:17:07.210 --> 01:17:09.691]  I've just been really getting freaked out lately on just being myself.
[01:17:12.152 --> 01:17:13.313]  I just can't believe this is happening.
[01:17:13.353 --> 01:17:13.853]  Thanks for the call.
[01:17:15.023 --> 01:17:20.665]  And I said I would go to a lot of your calls, and we haven't really done that yet because the callers are all making such good points.
[01:17:21.145 --> 01:17:23.986]  And I felt bad to the caller earlier, Lamar in Mississippi.
[01:17:24.026 --> 01:17:25.366]  It's just you were unintelligible, sir.
[01:17:25.386 --> 01:17:27.747]  If you can get to a landline, you can call back in.
[01:17:28.147 --> 01:17:29.528]  When we get back, we'll go to Scott.
[01:17:30.428 --> 01:17:32.689]  We'll go to KC, Dave, Chris, and others.
[01:17:34.970 --> 01:17:37.390]  You know, they have that cartoon, Pinky and the Brain.
[01:17:38.691 --> 01:17:42.732]  And Pinky asks the brain, he goes, what are we going to do today?
[01:17:43.829 --> 01:17:45.869]  And he goes, the same thing we do every day, Pinky.
[01:17:46.470 --> 01:17:47.390]  Conquer the world.
[01:17:48.930 --> 01:17:51.891]  Normal people get a little bit of power, a little bit of money.
[01:17:51.911 --> 01:17:52.571]  You get happy.
[01:17:52.591 --> 01:17:53.891]  You go off into the sunset.
[01:17:55.132 --> 01:17:56.192]  Not sickos.
[01:17:56.552 --> 01:17:59.873]  And once they get total power, they just start killing everybody.
[01:17:59.913 --> 01:18:01.213]  Because that's the next power.
[01:18:01.613 --> 01:18:02.653]  It's like Kim Jong-il.
[01:18:03.453 --> 01:18:04.434]  It's criminology.
[01:18:04.514 --> 01:18:05.354]  It's psychology.
[01:18:05.694 --> 01:18:07.154]  I didn't make the rules this way.
[01:18:08.535 --> 01:18:10.335]  And we're going into the pit of hell.
[01:18:11.846 --> 01:18:14.387]  Do you realize, ladies and gentlemen, this isn't a joke?
[01:18:14.988 --> 01:18:23.051]  We have got really smart people who've got their stuff together, and they're moving ahead to put in a worldwide police state so they can then kill us.
[01:18:23.592 --> 01:18:24.412]  And they say it!
[01:18:25.893 --> 01:18:26.693]  Official U.N.
[01:18:26.733 --> 01:18:28.414]  treaties, documents, there's hundreds of them.
[01:18:28.434 --> 01:18:29.375]  I've got it in Road to Tyranny.
[01:18:29.735 --> 01:18:34.257]  They say they're going to put in a worldwide police state, as Dr. Bianca said, and then they're going to start to kill them.
[01:18:35.660 --> 01:18:37.061]  And I'm sorry if that freaks you out.
[01:18:37.542 --> 01:18:45.648]  Don't be dying of a bioweapon with your family five, ten years from now and go, Alex was right, I didn't listen.
[01:18:46.468 --> 01:18:47.889]  We can stop them, folks.
[01:18:49.370 --> 01:18:51.632]  Oh, man.
[01:18:53.634 --> 01:18:57.677]  Hey, want to know a natural healing treatment that's been around for thousands of years?
[01:18:58.297 --> 01:18:59.058]  Salt products.
[01:18:59.898 --> 01:19:03.341]  Now Soleil Wellness brings these natural healing products to your home.
[01:19:04.096 --> 01:19:07.818]  Easy to use, non-toxic, and 100% natural.
[01:19:08.199 --> 01:19:11.881]  These products help to give you great physical, mental, and spiritual results.
[01:19:12.401 --> 01:19:14.722]  Heated cell pillows for earaches and back pain.
[01:19:15.163 --> 01:19:17.164]  Cell pipes to relieve respiratory ailments.
[01:19:17.524 --> 01:19:21.386]  Bath salts release toxins as they soften and rehydrate the skin.
[01:19:21.767 --> 01:19:25.569]  Pretty salt lamps to ionize the air and reduce EMF radiation.
[01:19:26.049 --> 01:19:28.450]  So many different cell products available for you.
[01:19:28.771 --> 01:19:30.332]  It's time to let the secret out.
[01:19:30.552 --> 01:19:31.032]  Visit Solar
[01:19:31.052 --> 01:19:31.432]  Or call 312-224-2710.
[01:19:31.452 --> 01:19:31.672]  That's 312-224-2710.
[01:19:31.932 --> 01:19:33.673]  Mention GCN Live for a free gift.
[01:19:52.372 --> 01:19:53.533]  Ted Anderson from Midas.
[01:19:53.593 --> 01:19:55.494]  Today is October 9th, 2006.
[01:19:56.054 --> 01:20:01.177]  Gold opened at $577.90 and one ounce gold coins can be purchased for $609.65.
[01:20:02.238 --> 01:20:05.960]  Again, that's $609.65 to purchase one ounce gold coins.
[01:20:06.180 --> 01:20:08.842]  Do you ever wonder why deficit spending never goes away?
[01:20:09.222 --> 01:20:13.824]  Would you believe me if I told you that fiscal responsibility would lead to a second Great Depression?
[01:20:14.004 --> 01:20:15.405]  Believe it or not, this is true.
[01:20:15.785 --> 01:20:18.927]  Our economy gets its currency from a private banking cartel.
[01:20:19.307 --> 01:20:24.769]  We, the people, labor to create the money, only to turn it over to this institution for its seal of approval.
[01:20:25.169 --> 01:20:30.812]  They, in turn, lend it back to us, and we, the people, are forced to labor to service the interest on this debt.
[01:20:31.232 --> 01:20:36.136]  Minus Resources is offering The Creature from Jekyll Island, a second look at the Federal Reserve.
[01:20:36.536 --> 01:20:39.299]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:20:39.779 --> 01:20:42.141]  If you haven't read this book, get a copy today.
[01:20:42.161 --> 01:20:44.183]  800-686-2237.
[01:20:45.284 --> 01:20:48.066]  If you have, pick up a copy for your friend or relative.
[01:20:48.326 --> 01:20:48.726]  Call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:20:52.933 --> 01:20:56.095]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[01:20:56.135 --> 01:21:00.178]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[01:21:00.298 --> 01:21:02.880]  But if you place them on the magnet, all would stick.
[01:21:02.940 --> 01:21:05.241]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[01:21:05.442 --> 01:21:13.887]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 psi, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[01:21:13.967 --> 01:21:15.288]  The Berkey Light is different.
[01:21:15.408 --> 01:21:19.411]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous pack
[01:21:19.811 --> 01:21:33.238]  This allows the proprietary media formulation to remove and reduce pathogenic bacteria, cysts, chemicals, herbicides, pesticides, organic solvents, foul tastes, odors, heavy metals, and nitrates.
[01:21:33.458 --> 01:21:39.821]  It is so powerful it purifies raw, untreated water from remote lakes, streams, and stagnant ponds.
[01:21:39.921 --> 01:21:50.088]  Get the Advanced Berkey Life Purifier for only $279 by calling New Millennium 888-803-4438 or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[01:21:50.229 --> 01:21:51.489]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:21:52.490 --> 01:21:55.492]  Price includes 4% down payment and 8% APR over 30 years.
[01:21:55.712 --> 01:21:59.575]  If you could own a home for $199 a month, would you do it?
[01:21:59.855 --> 01:22:03.878]  Because the government and private banks are liquidating thousands of homes right now.
[01:22:04.179 --> 01:22:07.881]  Homes that have been foreclosed, confiscated, or repossessed for as little as $199 a month.
[01:22:09.042 --> 01:22:14.686]  For a list of foreclosures in your area, call BNI at 1-800-899-7633.
[01:22:14.886 --> 01:22:17.988]  Homes of every shape and size are being liquidated right now.
[01:22:18.288 --> 01:22:25.012]  To find these foreclosed homes and properties in your area, homes for as little as $199 a month, request a listing from BNI today.
[01:22:25.293 --> 01:22:28.695]  Call toll-free 1-800-899-7633.
[01:22:28.915 --> 01:22:32.317]  If you can afford $199 a month, you can afford to buy a home.
[01:22:32.577 --> 01:22:37.640]  But you can't afford to wait, because these homes are being liquidated immediately, many for as little as $199 a month.
[01:22:38.701 --> 01:22:41.083]  For a list of homes and properties in your area, call 1-800-899-7633.
[01:22:41.183 --> 01:22:42.283]  Find out what $1.99 a month can get you by calling 1-800-899-7633.
[01:22:42.303 --> 01:22:42.363]  1-800-899-7633.
[01:22:42.403 --> 01:22:42.764]  It's a catch-22.
[01:22:42.784 --> 01:22:43.624]  Your calls are always great.
[01:22:43.644 --> 01:22:46.326]  But then if I let you belabor and go on forever, then we don't get to the other people.
[01:22:46.366 --> 01:22:47.346]  Same thing goes with my comments.
[01:22:47.446 --> 01:22:48.827]  I've got a lot of comments I want to make.
[01:23:08.382 --> 01:23:16.529]  You really can't get on air and say the elite plan to kill 90% of us, and somebody will email me and say, you just said 80%.
[01:23:16.629 --> 01:23:17.850]  It depends on the document.
[01:23:18.331 --> 01:23:20.353]  The UN treaties say reduction of 66%.
[01:23:21.353 --> 01:23:22.174]  The caller was right.
[01:23:22.715 --> 01:23:28.740]  But then the actual scientists that wrote up the plans were saying 80% a few decades ago.
[01:23:28.820 --> 01:23:29.821]  Now the average is 90%.
[01:23:31.442 --> 01:23:33.324]  And many others just say kill everyone.
[01:23:35.280 --> 01:23:37.382]  And that's now been all over MSNBC.
[01:23:37.442 --> 01:23:39.103]  It's been all over Fox News.
[01:23:39.163 --> 01:23:54.275]  It's now known that the majority of the biologists and population strategists, people that study all of this, the climatologists, the people that study the environment, this is their religion and I've been around them.
[01:23:54.735 --> 01:23:56.817]  That's why I knew about this before I ever read it in a document.
[01:23:57.117 --> 01:23:59.399]  All they do is walk around and talk about everyone must die.
[01:24:00.151 --> 01:24:08.256]  And the elite just love this, because if you've got a bunch of weird academic cult members who think everybody should die, well, so what if there's a big war and you kill a bunch of people?
[01:24:08.516 --> 01:24:10.057]  So what if you're torturing people to death?
[01:24:10.257 --> 01:24:12.358]  So what if you do exterminate a bunch of people?
[01:24:12.398 --> 01:24:15.059]  It's a Hitlerian eugenics excuse.
[01:24:15.379 --> 01:24:16.280]  That's what Hitler said.
[01:24:16.320 --> 01:24:17.841]  He said the environment was in trouble.
[01:24:18.081 --> 01:24:19.802]  We've got to reduce the population.
[01:24:19.862 --> 01:24:21.643]  Humans are destroying the earth.
[01:24:22.606 --> 01:24:23.346]  Where did he get that?
[01:24:23.386 --> 01:24:25.407]  He got that from eugenicists here in the U.S.
[01:24:25.947 --> 01:24:34.088]  And they openly say, all of them, all their textbooks on the subject, all the treaties, they say we must have a police state.
[01:24:34.108 --> 01:24:35.348]  They even say police state.
[01:24:35.889 --> 01:24:40.849]  Bianca, in that famous speech, he said, we need a police state like China so we can carry this out.
[01:24:41.330 --> 01:24:41.890]  That's a quote.
[01:24:42.350 --> 01:24:44.290]  They want the grid in.
[01:24:44.610 --> 01:24:48.831]  They want to get you basically in societal handcuffs, and then they want to kill you.
[01:24:49.853 --> 01:24:51.436]  You know, it's like at a slaughterhouse.
[01:24:51.476 --> 01:24:55.802]  They've got a big electronic squeeze chute that squeezes the cow so it can't escape.
[01:24:55.842 --> 01:24:59.508]  And they come up with a big old giant razor blade and just slit that throat.
[01:24:59.608 --> 01:25:00.950]  There you go, baby!
[01:25:01.371 --> 01:25:02.813]  And let me tell you, the squeeze chute's going...
[01:25:05.089 --> 01:25:08.751]  And the person in front of us is going, Easy now, Cal.
[01:25:08.791 --> 01:25:10.412]  Easy now.
[01:25:10.432 --> 01:25:14.294]  Everything's going to be all right.
[01:25:14.495 --> 01:25:15.315]  Don't kick there.
[01:25:15.455 --> 01:25:16.356]  There you go.
[01:25:16.996 --> 01:25:21.319]  Once you let me get this locked down, everything's going to be all right there for you.
[01:25:22.339 --> 01:25:23.400]  Government loves you.
[01:25:23.640 --> 01:25:25.941]  Don't listen to the terrorists that talk about freedom.
[01:25:26.281 --> 01:25:32.383]  Don't listen to the people that talk about land rights or the Second Amendment or the North American Union being bad.
[01:25:32.403 --> 01:25:35.985]  In just a minute, Cal, you're going to feel a lot better.
[01:25:36.005 --> 01:25:40.867]  And a lot of people, a lot of people were in the pens going, stop causing a problem.
[01:25:41.027 --> 01:25:41.907]  They're here to help us.
[01:25:41.947 --> 01:25:42.828]  You're a weirdo.
[01:25:43.048 --> 01:25:44.448]  You shouldn't be so upset.
[01:25:44.868 --> 01:25:46.009]  Just get in line.
[01:25:46.709 --> 01:25:48.670]  No, I'm not going along with it.
[01:25:49.630 --> 01:25:51.091]  Okay, I'm out of control today.
[01:25:53.203 --> 01:25:54.304]  But this is out of control.
[01:25:54.344 --> 01:25:55.925]  This subject is out of control.
[01:25:56.446 --> 01:25:58.228]  Let's go ahead and talk to Scott.
[01:25:58.248 --> 01:25:59.349]  Where are you calling us from, Scott?
[01:26:00.130 --> 01:26:00.410]  Hi, Alex.
[01:26:00.430 --> 01:26:01.832]  I'm calling from Belleville, Illinois.
[01:26:02.052 --> 01:26:02.553]  Welcome.
[01:26:03.634 --> 01:26:05.195]  I had a couple things to mention really quick.
[01:26:05.215 --> 01:26:06.257]  I won't take up too much time.
[01:26:06.837 --> 01:26:08.819]  First thing, J-Post headline...
[01:26:10.009 --> 01:26:13.031]  Israel has cause for concern over North Korea nuclear test.
[01:26:13.231 --> 01:26:17.054]  That's right, because they're going to give it to Iran, and hit Iran now!
[01:26:17.334 --> 01:26:18.075]  Hit them, hit them!
[01:26:18.115 --> 01:26:19.176]  North Korea's bad!
[01:26:19.196 --> 01:26:23.939]  You know, it's kind of like Afghanistan supposedly attacked us, so we attack Iraq.
[01:26:24.300 --> 01:26:27.642]  So I guess, you know, why don't we just attack Japan, because North Korea did something.
[01:26:27.682 --> 01:26:28.262]  Sorry, go ahead.
[01:26:28.903 --> 01:26:30.004]  Exactly, that's what I was going to say.
[01:26:30.924 --> 01:26:35.948]  In the article, the word North Korea is mentioned 16 times, you know, of course.
[01:26:36.368 --> 01:26:38.290]  The word South Korea is mentioned zero times.
[01:26:39.011 --> 01:26:41.792]  Guess how many times the word Iran is mentioned in this article?
[01:26:42.913 --> 01:26:41.792]  21.
[01:26:42.933 --> 01:26:46.815]  15.
[01:26:44.974 --> 01:26:46.815]  So North Korea is mentioned 16 times.
[01:26:46.915 --> 01:26:47.995]  I've got the article right here.
[01:26:48.456 --> 01:26:48.596]  Yeah.
[01:26:48.956 --> 01:26:57.720]  Iran is mentioned 15 times, and Syria is mentioned 1, and the word South Korea, the most relevant other country than North Korea in the article, is mentioned 0 times.
[01:26:58.340 --> 01:27:01.202]  Well, we've got to... That's not the only article.
[01:27:01.929 --> 01:27:05.530]  Coming out of Israel, we've got to hit Iran now because North Korea did this.
[01:27:05.990 --> 01:27:12.633]  Didn't you know it was North Korea that is good and that it's Iran that did the nuclear test today?
[01:27:13.613 --> 01:27:14.093]  Exactly.
[01:27:14.593 --> 01:27:21.455]  The second thing I want to mention... Hey, half of Americans still think Saddam watched 9-11, even when the president said they didn't, so it doesn't matter.
[01:27:21.475 --> 01:27:24.996]  If the media tells people Iran did this, they'll believe it.
[01:27:25.877 --> 01:27:26.457]  Sorry.
[01:27:27.417 --> 01:27:28.818]  Anyway, the second thing I want to mention...
[01:27:30.066 --> 01:27:31.588]  We've got our DVD production up here.
[01:27:31.648 --> 01:27:38.158]  We've produced 1,000 DVDs the past couple months, including Terror Storm, Martial Law, Loose Change, and 9-11 Plain and Sight.
[01:27:38.698 --> 01:27:41.903]  And we're handing them out as best we can with what money we have available here.
[01:27:42.884 --> 01:27:43.405]  Good job.
[01:27:43.465 --> 01:27:45.929]  What response is Terror Storm getting for you?
[01:27:46.661 --> 01:27:47.281]  I'm not sure.
[01:27:47.441 --> 01:27:48.602]  We're all doing our parts here.
[01:27:48.682 --> 01:27:51.602]  We run a software company here, so we sit here all day and burn DVDs.
[01:27:51.662 --> 01:27:52.183]  I understand.
[01:27:52.223 --> 01:27:54.163]  You just give them to people, fire and forget.
[01:27:54.203 --> 01:27:54.923]  That's the best way.
[01:27:55.223 --> 01:27:59.224]  Well, we have a guy who distributes them for us, and he actually, I mean, this guy's awesome.
[01:27:59.244 --> 01:28:08.507]  He goes to, like, shopping malls and places like that and just sits there, or stands there, rather, and just starts confronting people and starts handing these things out and just starts telling them the truth.
[01:28:08.687 --> 01:28:10.027]  No, I did that in New York.
[01:28:10.067 --> 01:28:11.928]  That's what it's going to take to stop these people.
[01:28:12.448 --> 01:28:12.728]  Exactly.
[01:28:12.748 --> 01:28:13.668]  He's been getting a good response.
[01:28:13.708 --> 01:28:15.329]  But what I wanted to tell you about here, this is insane.
[01:28:16.591 --> 01:28:18.712]  This same guy in St.
[01:28:18.732 --> 01:28:23.295]  Louis, which is pretty close to Belleville here, there's a park called Fenton City Park.
[01:28:23.615 --> 01:28:25.776]  And in this park, they have a 9-11 memorial.
[01:28:26.017 --> 01:28:26.317]  Stay there.
[01:28:26.337 --> 01:28:27.037]  I want to hear about it.
[01:28:27.758 --> 01:28:28.058]  Stay there.
[01:28:28.078 --> 01:28:28.878]  I want to hear about this.
[01:28:29.759 --> 01:28:30.679]  Let me guess.
[01:28:31.320 --> 01:28:33.841]  They won't let him hand it out there in a public place.
[01:28:34.982 --> 01:28:36.403]  You've got to get a video camera.
[01:28:36.423 --> 01:28:38.264]  You've got to videotape it when they try it.
[01:28:38.684 --> 01:28:39.264]  Give it to us.
[01:28:39.344 --> 01:28:40.045]  It'll be huge.
[01:28:42.646 --> 01:28:43.527]  We're on the march.
[01:28:44.027 --> 01:28:45.528]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:46.540 --> 01:28:49.324]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:52.488 --> 01:28:56.553]  People who use Cardivite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[01:28:56.754 --> 01:29:00.158]  For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself time-tested.
[01:29:00.338 --> 01:29:03.763]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite.
[01:29:04.068 --> 01:29:07.290]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[01:29:07.330 --> 01:29:12.794]  This basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the diseases that we see.
[01:29:12.834 --> 01:29:22.480]  When we do our program, you know, herbal formulas like Cardavite, and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill now going for a regular job a few months later, we know we're doing something right.
[01:29:22.600 --> 01:29:23.941]  It's a well-thought-out formula.
[01:29:23.981 --> 01:29:29.385]  I mean, the idea of it working on yeast and metals both at the same time and liver function is dead on.
[01:29:29.885 --> 01:29:34.309]  You'll find, I think, that it'll work more than just on heart problems and circulation problems.
[01:29:34.330 --> 01:29:35.751]  It'll work on other problems as well.
[01:29:35.931 --> 01:29:39.815]  For more information, call 1-877-928-8822 or visit our website at www.heartdrop.com.
[01:29:39.855 --> 01:29:40.676]  That toll-free number again, 1-877-928-8822.
[01:29:53.217 --> 01:29:56.780]  As snow falls on the majestic Rocky Mountains, it eventually melts.
[01:29:56.980 --> 01:30:02.845]  The water east of the continental divide travels downhill over 1,600 miles before reaching the Atlantic Ocean.
[01:30:03.025 --> 01:30:05.507]  On the western side, water travels downhill almost 1,000 miles
[01:30:09.684 --> 01:30:10.004]  I think so.
[01:30:28.234 --> 01:30:28.954]  We're good to go.
[01:30:28.974 --> 01:30:29.454]  We're good to go.
[01:30:52.751 --> 01:30:55.253]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network.
[01:30:55.353 --> 01:30:57.714]  I have an urgent message for all of our listeners.
[01:30:57.775 --> 01:31:03.959]  The mass media keeps telling us that we are the richest, most powerful economy in the world.
[01:31:05.440 --> 01:31:07.741]  If this is true, why can't we pay our bills?
[01:31:08.402 --> 01:31:11.944]  Why is the United States the world's largest debtor nation?
[01:31:12.485 --> 01:31:16.627]  The truth is that we are in the worst debt bubble in our nation's history.
[01:31:17.208 --> 01:31:20.150]  When the bubble bursts, will you be able to feed your family?
[01:31:21.132 --> 01:31:24.053]  When the inevitable crash occurs, will you be ready?
[01:31:24.793 --> 01:31:30.795]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.
[01:31:31.275 --> 01:31:33.876]  That's 1-888-892-6238.
[01:31:34.116 --> 01:31:38.698]  For the following two free reports, U.S.
[01:31:38.798 --> 01:31:41.699]  Debt Bubble, Red Alert, and Real Estate Crash.
[01:31:42.659 --> 01:31:44.960]  Call 888-8XANADU.
[01:31:45.020 --> 01:31:49.201]  That's 888-8XANADU.
[01:31:49.542 --> 01:31:50.502]  And ask for George.
[01:31:53.040 --> 01:31:58.665]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:32:03.388 --> 01:32:05.030]  Monday through Friday, 11 a.m.
[01:32:05.050 --> 01:32:05.790]  until 2 p.m.
[01:32:05.830 --> 01:32:20.662]  Central Standard Time, back from 9 to midnight, right here on the GCN Radio Network, and now on the Genesis Network, out of the studios of MS Communications, 590 KLBJ, Sundays from 4 to 6 p.m., and we're going to expand that to three hours.
[01:32:21.332 --> 01:32:22.834]  Very, very soon.
[01:32:22.894 --> 01:32:27.420]  So for all of our affiliates out there, it's a hard-hitting, fast-paced show.
[01:32:27.460 --> 01:32:29.883]  We take a lot of calls and a lot of guests, a lot of news.
[01:32:30.849 --> 01:32:35.430]  There is a new program available for you Sundays live, 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:32:35.970 --> 01:32:37.631]  I'd like you to pick us up this Sunday.
[01:32:37.711 --> 01:32:40.312]  That would be really exciting and we'd appreciate that.
[01:32:40.732 --> 01:32:43.152]  A lot of stations calling in saying they want to carry it.
[01:32:43.512 --> 01:32:45.093]  We're very, very excited.
[01:32:45.133 --> 01:32:50.054]  So all of our existing affiliates, if you can, please pick up the show and carry it live, 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:32:50.094 --> 01:32:56.776]  Central, or tape it and re-air it later in the evening if you want a hard-hitting broadcast that covers current events.
[01:32:57.671 --> 01:32:58.411]  Okay, here's what happened.
[01:32:58.431 --> 01:32:59.852]  So, Fenton City Park, in the St.
[01:32:59.952 --> 01:33:00.432]  Louis area,
[01:33:22.482 --> 01:33:25.603]  They just recently installed like a 9-11 memorial.
[01:33:25.963 --> 01:33:31.025]  There's no steel there, but just like a little... Actually, it's... Anyway, a little 9-11 memorial inside the park.
[01:33:31.465 --> 01:33:39.768]  And what he would do is, I think for about a week or two, every day or every other day, he would go to the park, and for some reason, he would lay out six DVDs.
[01:33:39.808 --> 01:33:41.489]  I think they were Terrorist Guard Martial Law or something.
[01:33:42.029 --> 01:33:47.131]  And he'd lay them out, and I'd come back the next day, and they were taken, so people were taking them, hopefully.
[01:33:47.711 --> 01:33:50.872]  And what happened was, after doing this for a couple weeks...
[01:33:51.536 --> 01:33:52.016]  We're good to go.
[01:34:13.527 --> 01:34:15.709]  How they even knew it was him, if they got his license plate number?
[01:34:15.729 --> 01:34:16.910]  Yeah, no, no, no.
[01:34:17.471 --> 01:34:17.731]  St.
[01:34:17.791 --> 01:34:20.935]  Louis, both, you know, the part, old St.
[01:34:20.955 --> 01:34:21.696]  Louis, new St.
[01:34:21.736 --> 01:34:23.358]  Louis, or what would you have, East St.
[01:34:23.378 --> 01:34:25.860]  Louis, and then both areas of St.
[01:34:25.880 --> 01:34:31.407]  Louis, we know in Indiana, we know in Kansas, we know in Missouri, we know in Illinois, every state in the Union...
[01:34:32.216 --> 01:34:37.000]  Has the cameras now hooked in to license plate reading cameras?
[01:34:37.501 --> 01:34:42.005]  So they're tracking you everywhere, sir, and I've seen articles in St.
[01:34:42.045 --> 01:34:43.646]  Louis, I don't know which one of the St.
[01:34:43.666 --> 01:34:50.172]  Louis's though, I forget, where they had gotten the software a few years ago, so that's a big brother for you, but please continue.
[01:34:50.773 --> 01:34:57.639]  Okay, so that's probably how they got a hold of him, but anyway, so they start leaving messages, like multiple messages, and he's kind of scared, so he's not calling them back, and
[01:34:58.024 --> 01:34:58.804]  I said, go ahead and call him back.
[01:34:58.844 --> 01:35:02.226]  If we do, we've got to bring a camera in there and meet him in a public place, blah, blah, blah.
[01:35:02.286 --> 01:35:06.308]  Anyway, a few days afterwards, they come to his house.
[01:35:06.528 --> 01:35:09.549]  Eight in the morning, they start pounding on his door, saying, you better open up.
[01:35:09.569 --> 01:35:11.810]  We're going to arrest you, and all this other nonsense.
[01:35:12.370 --> 01:35:13.331]  He never did open his door.
[01:35:13.371 --> 01:35:15.112]  In fact, he called me right after they came.
[01:35:15.132 --> 01:35:16.092]  He said, what should I do?
[01:35:16.112 --> 01:35:17.313]  I said, don't talk to him.
[01:35:18.133 --> 01:35:22.255]  Eventually, he called him back, and he said, okay, what do you guys want to talk to me about?
[01:35:22.748 --> 01:35:28.390]  And he said, we just wanted to talk to you about the stuff you're doing in Fenton City Park, and you need to come down here and talk to us.
[01:35:28.410 --> 01:35:29.530]  And he said, well, I don't think so.
[01:35:29.550 --> 01:35:30.590]  I'm not going to come down there, you know?
[01:35:31.910 --> 01:35:34.771]  I ought to get on an airplane and come there and bullhorn.
[01:35:35.851 --> 01:35:37.792]  I mean, how un-American are these people?
[01:35:37.852 --> 01:35:38.952]  People are getting arrested now.
[01:35:38.992 --> 01:35:42.253]  They say this war is reprehensible, walking by Dick Cheney.
[01:35:42.513 --> 01:35:44.354]  This is the United States scum.
[01:35:46.134 --> 01:35:48.995]  So they think it's evil that he's handing out DVDs, huh?
[01:35:49.887 --> 01:35:50.308]  Exactly.
[01:35:50.408 --> 01:35:51.509]  This is the stupidest part.
[01:35:51.529 --> 01:35:53.130]  They never even watch the DVD.
[01:35:53.551 --> 01:35:54.572]  They never even watch the DVD.
[01:35:54.592 --> 01:35:56.394]  They don't even know what's on the DVD to this day.
[01:35:56.494 --> 01:35:58.055]  Oh no, it's called Crime Stop in 1984.
[01:35:59.377 --> 01:36:01.058]  They know, did not even watch it.
[01:36:01.379 --> 01:36:02.740]  They just are in total denial.
[01:36:02.780 --> 01:36:03.701]  They're not Americans.
[01:36:04.982 --> 01:36:07.505]  So they're trying to intimidate him.
[01:36:07.945 --> 01:36:09.507]  Let me guess, they told him don't do it anymore.
[01:36:10.322 --> 01:36:11.243]  Well, they did say that, yes.
[01:36:11.643 --> 01:36:15.865]  Tell me the whole story about the scum, and then I want your name and your friend's name.
[01:36:15.905 --> 01:36:17.306]  I want to make a big report about this.
[01:36:17.746 --> 01:36:18.386]  Not a problem.
[01:36:18.527 --> 01:36:18.767]  Okay.
[01:36:19.087 --> 01:36:21.728]  So anyway, and I'll get you all the details, the detective's name, we got all that stuff.
[01:36:21.748 --> 01:36:22.989]  But anyway, so he's talking to this guy.
[01:36:23.009 --> 01:36:23.509]  Yeah, put it in an email.
[01:36:23.529 --> 01:36:27.531]  Send it to me, and I want to do an on-phone interview, and I want to get your friend on.
[01:36:27.551 --> 01:36:27.972]  But go ahead.
[01:36:28.472 --> 01:36:28.852]  No problem.
[01:36:28.992 --> 01:36:29.312]  No problem.
[01:36:29.332 --> 01:36:32.614]  So anyway, so he's talking to this guy, and the guy says, I just want to talk to you about the incident.
[01:36:33.014 --> 01:36:34.695]  And so my friend just explained what he was doing, and...
[01:36:36.662 --> 01:36:38.623]  And, of course, ask the cop, well, why are you guys arresting me?
[01:36:38.643 --> 01:36:45.907]  And he should never have done this without witnesses because a lot of times cops will decide, this guy's a terrorist, I'm going to go ahead and make something up on him.
[01:36:46.427 --> 01:36:48.648]  It's the freedom until we get the bad guys.
[01:36:48.828 --> 01:36:51.470]  They've been caught coast to coast, every major department doing it.
[01:36:52.470 --> 01:36:55.291]  You're nuts if you meet with the police without a warrant.
[01:36:55.331 --> 01:36:57.893]  Make them go ahead and arrest you, and then don't say a word.
[01:36:57.933 --> 01:36:58.273]  Go ahead.
[01:36:59.127 --> 01:37:04.871]  So anyway, he's talking to this guy, and the detective said, we just wanted to make sure you weren't going to hurt anybody.
[01:37:05.331 --> 01:37:05.871]  Oh, yeah.
[01:37:05.891 --> 01:37:08.033]  And my friend said, well, no, we're not going to hurt anybody.
[01:37:08.053 --> 01:37:10.014]  What are you talking about?
[01:37:10.034 --> 01:37:14.817]  And he started to kind of give the police guy some information about just the general stuff.
[01:37:14.877 --> 01:37:16.978]  Government did it, all this other, just the usual.
[01:37:17.119 --> 01:37:22.862]  Yeah, just all over Rolling Stone magazine, Vanity Fair, cover of everything, top news.
[01:37:23.122 --> 01:37:24.803]  Yeah, but the cop hadn't heard about it.
[01:37:25.504 --> 01:37:25.844]  Exactly.
[01:37:25.864 --> 01:37:28.606]  He's like, oh, you're one of those guys that think Bush blew up the towers, right?
[01:37:29.421 --> 01:37:33.003]  And my friend's kind of, well, not exactly, but I guess so.
[01:37:33.063 --> 01:37:35.525]  That's kind of what happened, I guess you can say.
[01:37:36.165 --> 01:37:37.206]  And it was kind of funny.
[01:37:37.226 --> 01:37:43.309]  My friend actually started talking to him and I guess began to kind of wake him up just a little bit, not successfully.
[01:37:43.329 --> 01:37:44.810]  The cop was acting like that.
[01:37:45.491 --> 01:37:45.831]  I don't know.
[01:37:45.891 --> 01:37:47.472]  Most of the cops were awake in New York.
[01:37:47.552 --> 01:37:51.754]  I just, anybody who, I'm so sick of it.
[01:37:51.794 --> 01:37:57.798]  You know, I've gotten calls from New Zealand, calls from Canada, calls from Colorado, calls
[01:37:58.439 --> 01:37:59.460]  Calls from England.
[01:37:59.961 --> 01:38:02.704]  Please stop handing out your DVDs.
[01:38:02.784 --> 01:38:03.845]  It's scaring people.
[01:38:04.186 --> 01:38:05.948]  Are you doing that to threaten people?
[01:38:05.988 --> 01:38:07.249]  Because that could be illegal.
[01:38:07.690 --> 01:38:13.917]  We get threat calls by police every week here because our listeners are out giving people DVDs.
[01:38:13.937 --> 01:38:16.981]  Remember Kelly Rushing two years ago?
[01:38:18.082 --> 01:38:20.023]  Up in Lyon County, Kentucky.
[01:38:20.083 --> 01:38:21.044]  No criminal record.
[01:38:21.084 --> 01:38:22.504]  Upstanding family in the town.
[01:38:22.864 --> 01:38:24.085]  He's a business owner.
[01:38:24.905 --> 01:38:26.086]  Well known in the community.
[01:38:26.126 --> 01:38:27.567]  The cops knew who he was.
[01:38:27.987 --> 01:38:36.471]  He gives a state police officer a Ron Paul speech and 9-11 Road to Tyranny was on after it.
[01:38:36.831 --> 01:38:39.712]  And in court they said the Ron Paul tape was illegal.
[01:38:40.032 --> 01:38:42.374]  They believe a congressman in the well of the house is illegal.
[01:38:42.754 --> 01:38:45.315]  I talked to the judge, by the way, at his house on the phone.
[01:38:46.115 --> 01:38:47.316]  Now, they pressed charges.
[01:38:47.376 --> 01:38:48.217]  It was in the paper.
[01:38:48.517 --> 01:38:57.404]  And the jury came in and said not guilty of terroristic threats because the state police officer said he was intimidated by Ron Paul's speech.
[01:38:57.725 --> 01:39:01.128]  These people would work for Stalin, okay?
[01:39:01.148 --> 01:39:05.691]  If they were ordered to, they would come arrest people's families and put them in gulags.
[01:39:05.891 --> 01:39:06.992]  You're not American!
[01:39:07.153 --> 01:39:09.454]  The Founding Fathers hate you!
[01:39:09.815 --> 01:39:12.157]  I want you to know I don't like you either!
[01:39:12.998 --> 01:39:13.638]  Oh, I hate them!
[01:39:13.979 --> 01:39:16.061]  I hate these America-killing scum!
[01:39:16.221 --> 01:39:18.644]  What have you done to our country, you maggots!
[01:39:19.085 --> 01:39:20.146]  You maggots!
[01:39:21.187 --> 01:39:23.370]  Sorry, I just... They are, though.
[01:39:23.390 --> 01:39:24.131]  They're maggots!
[01:39:24.711 --> 01:39:25.692]  They're maggots!
[01:39:26.173 --> 01:39:29.657]  So you think your friend's going through something, Kelly rushing, and there have been other cases.
[01:39:29.717 --> 01:39:30.618]  It's all the same.
[01:39:31.579 --> 01:39:32.160]  I'm sorry, sir.
[01:39:32.200 --> 01:39:32.861]  What else is on your mind?
[01:39:33.447 --> 01:39:34.728]  Well, that's about it.
[01:39:34.829 --> 01:39:38.693]  And the last thing he said was, he said, hey, now listen, he's talking to the cops.
[01:39:38.713 --> 01:39:48.384]  He said, listen, I know you guys have to watch these training videos from the ADL that says, you know, anybody who does this or does that, they're evil, they're terrorists, they're racist, they're prejudiced, they're criminals, blah, blah, blah.
[01:39:48.884 --> 01:39:50.246]  And it's kind of funny, the cops start laughing.
[01:39:50.266 --> 01:39:52.548]  Yeah, we do have to watch those, but, you know, so.
[01:39:53.569 --> 01:39:54.951]  That will get to the cops.
[01:39:55.655 --> 01:39:58.797]  If you can tell them the subsection, all right, they made you read Megiddo.
[01:39:58.897 --> 01:40:00.018]  All right, well, they say this.
[01:40:00.138 --> 01:40:01.458]  Well, how is that the case?
[01:40:01.678 --> 01:40:05.340]  Well, you know, the ADL's actually been arrested and lost cases.
[01:40:05.380 --> 01:40:06.901]  They break into police files.
[01:40:07.241 --> 01:40:09.042]  It's actually a mafia organization.
[01:40:09.223 --> 01:40:13.285]  Here, officer, let me get on Google right here and pull up some news articles for you.
[01:40:13.885 --> 01:40:15.046]  But I wouldn't kiss their rear end.
[01:40:15.086 --> 01:40:16.487]  I'd say, now you know the truth.
[01:40:16.547 --> 01:40:17.787]  Stop acting like a punk.
[01:40:18.808 --> 01:40:20.129]  Stop acting like a punk!
[01:40:20.729 --> 01:40:22.590]  These people are killing our country!
[01:40:23.231 --> 01:40:25.052]  Hey, listen, I'm going to settle down now.
[01:40:25.633 --> 01:40:27.494]  Nothing makes me madder than stuff like this.
[01:40:28.895 --> 01:40:32.178]  We'll hand out whatever we want, whenever we want, scum!
[01:40:32.698 --> 01:40:36.181]  And if you don't like it, move to Russia, where they kill reporters every day!
[01:40:38.042 --> 01:40:38.543]  I'm sorry.
[01:40:38.823 --> 01:40:45.728]  By the way, the reporter that was exposing that the Russian government was involved in the Beaslin Massacre, they capped her yesterday, you know that, right?
[01:40:46.609 --> 01:40:49.231]  On Putin's birthday, as a birthday present.
[01:40:49.748 --> 01:40:50.570]  Did you hear about that?
[01:41:01.949 --> 01:41:02.910]  You still there, Scott?
[01:41:03.070 --> 01:41:03.991]  Yeah, I didn't hear about it.
[01:41:04.591 --> 01:41:05.432]  I'm ranting here.
[01:41:05.792 --> 01:41:06.833]  But we should get mad.
[01:41:06.853 --> 01:41:12.497]  That's what we're here to do is get through our conditioning and stop braying like a bunch of sheep and get mean.
[01:41:13.318 --> 01:41:17.080]  Let me get your name and number, and I'm dead serious.
[01:41:17.521 --> 01:41:19.522]  Can you contact your associate and get him to call in?
[01:41:20.003 --> 01:41:20.703]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:41:20.723 --> 01:41:21.884]  We'll definitely get all the information for you.
[01:41:21.904 --> 01:41:22.684]  When can I do that?
[01:41:24.566 --> 01:41:25.727]  I want to do a report on this.
[01:41:26.387 --> 01:41:28.609]  Sure, if you want to have one of your workers or whatever...
[01:41:29.623 --> 01:41:31.064]  Now, I want to be clear, though.
[01:41:31.084 --> 01:41:33.846]  The officer during this discussion did say, we want you to stop.
[01:41:33.866 --> 01:41:36.607]  I have to verify that.
[01:41:36.627 --> 01:41:37.628]  I'm almost positive, yes.
[01:41:37.688 --> 01:41:38.388]  I have to verify that.
[01:41:38.428 --> 01:41:39.168]  Pure scum.
[01:41:39.289 --> 01:41:40.229]  Pure scum.
[01:41:40.369 --> 01:41:41.210]  Pure scum.
[01:41:41.550 --> 01:41:44.011]  I do know they were pounding on his door saying, we're going to arrest you if you don't open up.
[01:41:44.091 --> 01:41:44.712]  I do know that.
[01:41:44.852 --> 01:41:46.152]  And again, it was all color of law.
[01:41:46.172 --> 01:41:47.293]  It was all color of law.
[01:41:47.773 --> 01:41:48.474]  All criminal.
[01:41:48.794 --> 01:41:50.495]  All stab America in the neck.
[01:41:50.855 --> 01:41:52.196]  Stab America in the heart.
[01:41:52.576 --> 01:41:54.317]  Butcher my country, you trash.
[01:41:54.697 --> 01:41:58.378]  You're killing this country, and it's time for people to stop licking your boots.
[01:41:58.578 --> 01:42:00.919]  It's time for you to be told that you're a bunch of criminals.
[01:42:01.239 --> 01:42:02.199]  Listen, I appreciate it.
[01:42:02.880 --> 01:42:03.400]  Put him on hold.
[01:42:03.420 --> 01:42:06.081]  Let's get his name and number, and I want to get his associate on.
[01:42:06.101 --> 01:42:09.142]  Oh, man, I'm sick of it.
[01:42:10.382 --> 01:42:12.203]  I'm sick of having to do this job.
[01:42:12.483 --> 01:42:14.423]  I'm sick of seeing you kill my country.
[01:42:14.683 --> 01:42:22.466]  I'm sick of you watching... Let me recap news, and then I'll go to...
[01:42:23.823 --> 01:42:28.628]  KC, Dave, Chris, George, and everybody else.
[01:42:28.648 --> 01:42:29.388]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:42:29.408 --> 01:42:29.569]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:42:29.609 --> 01:42:39.878]  For those that don't know, the psychopathic demon Kim Jong-il, he is an actual threat to this country.
[01:42:40.199 --> 01:42:42.741]  He is totally evil, and that's why they're not doing anything to stop him.
[01:42:44.045 --> 01:43:03.111]  In fact, the Bush administration and the Clinton administration, because they're all working for the same global criminals, blocked the FBI and CIA from stopping the actual fiscal material being given to them, the reactors, the missile secrets, the delivery systems, the MIRV technology, the centrifuges, everything.
[01:43:04.168 --> 01:43:07.872]  AQ Khan and our own government, ABB, gave it to them.
[01:43:08.312 --> 01:43:13.978]  The Swiss, the British, our own government, the Pakistanis gave it to them.
[01:43:14.018 --> 01:43:15.679]  They tested a missile in 2000.
[01:43:16.180 --> 01:43:19.543]  North Korea hit us with a missile, a test missile, without a warhead.
[01:43:20.203 --> 01:43:21.525]  Now they've tested a bomb.
[01:43:21.805 --> 01:43:24.147]  They're saying they may test another in the next few days.
[01:43:24.708 --> 01:43:29.032]  It's a literal 4'9 psychopathic Napoleon complex twit.
[01:43:29.600 --> 01:43:30.820]  Hereditary dictator.
[01:43:31.240 --> 01:43:32.381]  But that isn't a problem.
[01:43:32.701 --> 01:43:38.562]  Israel's saying this is more a reason to hit Iran because North Korea might give them a bomb.
[01:43:39.982 --> 01:43:52.345]  That's like if somebody knocks over a liquor store and the cops go, well, we know who did it, but let's go arrest the guy that lives four doors down because he might go get a gun from them and rob a liquor store too.
[01:43:53.371 --> 01:43:56.232]  Them Iranians need to die.
[01:43:56.592 --> 01:43:59.413]  We need to turn it into a parking lot.
[01:43:59.613 --> 01:44:00.313]  Hey, where is it?
[01:44:00.493 --> 01:44:01.414]  Where is it on a map?
[01:44:01.894 --> 01:44:05.315]  I don't know where it is, but we need to attack it.
[01:44:05.335 --> 01:44:11.077]  If I hear one more of you people on the radio, I'm going to throw up.
[01:44:11.277 --> 01:44:12.357]  I'm in a dark mood right now.
[01:44:14.178 --> 01:44:15.699]  Well, I should be in a dark mood.
[01:44:15.719 --> 01:44:20.320]  We've got a bunch of perverts running Washington, a bunch of criminals laughing at us, running roughshod over us.
[01:44:20.660 --> 01:44:22.841]  I'm not a slave, folks, and I'm sick of it.
[01:44:24.275 --> 01:44:31.758]  And I'm tired of all these goody-two-shoe cops that think they're saving this country when they're carrying out criminal training they were given that's criminal!
[01:44:32.579 --> 01:44:36.641]  It's criminal to take people's children without warrants or indictments or arrest warrants.
[01:44:37.121 --> 01:44:41.803]  It's criminal to tell people it's the law to take vaccines when it isn't.
[01:44:42.409 --> 01:44:44.190]  And you still enforce a law that doesn't exist.
[01:44:44.230 --> 01:44:44.810]  And you doubt me?
[01:44:44.830 --> 01:44:45.490]  Go look it up.
[01:44:46.050 --> 01:44:47.771]  It's criminal to do what you do.
[01:44:48.131 --> 01:44:50.331]  It's criminal the things I've seen you do.
[01:44:50.571 --> 01:44:54.673]  It's criminal to ask to search a car without a warrant or to do it when the person refuses.
[01:44:54.933 --> 01:44:58.954]  It's criminal to have face scanning cameras and license plate reading cameras.
[01:44:59.154 --> 01:45:00.394]  It's not going to stop crime.
[01:45:00.414 --> 01:45:01.695]  The criminals run the system.
[01:45:01.975 --> 01:45:04.056]  You're naive and you work for criminals.
[01:45:04.556 --> 01:45:07.337]  At best you're naive and don't know what's going on.
[01:45:07.417 --> 01:45:10.457]  At worst you are a criminal and you love it.
[01:45:10.658 --> 01:45:12.058]  You're a cowardly bully.
[01:45:13.945 --> 01:45:15.526]  Bunch of red coat trash.
[01:45:17.788 --> 01:45:18.989]  Red coats are better than you are.
[01:45:20.791 --> 01:45:21.772]  I've had enough of it!
[01:45:23.553 --> 01:45:24.314]  I'm mad!
[01:45:25.235 --> 01:45:26.276]  I want to live my life!
[01:45:27.196 --> 01:45:29.919]  Our whole civilization is in danger because of you!
[01:45:29.939 --> 01:45:37.325]  Again, I blame David Rockefeller and Lord Rothschild and Zbigniew Brzezinski and all those criminals.
[01:45:37.786 --> 01:45:39.247]  But let me tell you who I'm really mad at.
[01:45:39.547 --> 01:45:41.769]  I'm mad at you for being stupid.
[01:45:42.973 --> 01:45:45.075]  I'm mad at you for being in denial.
[01:45:45.835 --> 01:45:48.457]  I'm mad at you out there for going along with this.
[01:45:49.278 --> 01:45:51.559]  Man, you're in for a serious fall, America.
[01:45:53.381 --> 01:45:55.442]  So keep believing your phony liberal garbage.
[01:45:55.762 --> 01:45:57.304]  Keep believing your phony conservative stuff.
[01:45:57.324 --> 01:45:58.765]  Just keep believing the pipe dream.
[01:45:58.785 --> 01:46:01.406]  Because I'm telling you, this show's the real world.
[01:46:01.447 --> 01:46:02.868]  We know what we're talking about here.
[01:46:03.188 --> 01:46:04.689]  We do our homework, okay?
[01:46:05.646 --> 01:46:17.053]  And man, let me tell you, if you could see what I see, if you knew what we were facing, if you've done the research, and I invite you to, all these callers you hear that laughed at me, all these people, they went and they looked and they found out it's bad.
[01:46:17.754 --> 01:46:19.135]  It's worse than what I'm saying.
[01:46:19.155 --> 01:46:20.275]  Alright.
[01:46:23.677 --> 01:46:32.383]  It's now come out, of course, that Foley, back in 2000, had been approached by senior members of the Republican Congress and been told to stop it.
[01:46:33.570 --> 01:46:45.840]  And he'd been going after and dating underage pages and all the fake neocon spin you've heard where they'll go get one message of hundreds that was to an 18-year-old and then spin it and claim all the messages were.
[01:46:46.300 --> 01:46:52.125]  That spin and all the spin about how he was drunk and did this and all the rest of it.
[01:46:52.725 --> 01:46:54.366]  Let me tell you why this is bringing them down.
[01:46:55.287 --> 01:46:57.449]  Wayne Madison worked for the National Security Agency.
[01:46:57.469 --> 01:46:58.810]  His info hooks into what we've got.
[01:46:59.130 --> 01:46:59.911]  He's proven to be very...
[01:47:01.055 --> 01:47:04.136]  Circumscript and focused and accurate in the past.
[01:47:04.636 --> 01:47:05.517]  And we already knew this.
[01:47:05.597 --> 01:47:08.018]  We weren't going to report it because I'm not going to stick my neck out, folks.
[01:47:08.038 --> 01:47:08.958]  I know a whole lot of stuff.
[01:47:09.218 --> 01:47:11.219]  But I always go off what's already been reported.
[01:47:11.919 --> 01:47:12.399]  D.C.
[01:47:12.519 --> 01:47:17.141]  gays, this is from a liberal point of view, say Hastert had sex with young men for hire.
[01:47:18.841 --> 01:47:19.342]  Well, of course.
[01:47:19.382 --> 01:47:20.482]  He's a senior Republican.
[01:47:22.083 --> 01:47:28.725]  The rumors about another top GOP member of the House being involved in sexual encounters with young men for hire are confirmed.
[01:47:30.413 --> 01:47:48.727]  For the Wayne Madison Report, by well-placed sources in Washington's gay community, the member in question is House Speaker Dennis Hastert, whose alternative lifestyle is the primary reason for him and his staff covering up a scandal involving ex-Florida GOP rep Mark Foley and his lewd messages sent to underage male congressional pages.
[01:47:49.268 --> 01:47:53.912]  Hastert's penchant to receive... I'm not going to say it.
[01:47:53.932 --> 01:47:56.594]  It is well known to our sources in D.C.
[01:47:56.614 --> 01:47:57.294]  gay community.
[01:47:57.835 --> 01:47:59.436]  Additionally, Hastert's reportedly...
[01:48:00.589 --> 01:48:01.330]  Oh my gosh.
[01:48:03.092 --> 01:48:03.933]  I can't read this.
[01:48:03.953 --> 01:48:05.775]  Oh man.
[01:48:06.035 --> 01:48:09.699]  Let's just say Speaker Hastert is the butt of many jokes among Washington's gay community.
[01:48:10.740 --> 01:48:13.503]  And it goes on to report, of course, he lives with his chief of staff.
[01:48:15.094 --> 01:48:23.180]  Wayne Mansford reported on old charges that swirled around Hastert when he was a high school wrestling coach at Yorkville High School in Yorkville, Illinois.
[01:48:23.620 --> 01:48:29.084]  Hastert decided to enter politics in 1980 after rumors surfaced about inappropriate contact with male high school students.
[01:48:29.464 --> 01:48:35.969]  In July, Hastert was hospitalized at Bethesda Naval Hospital for cellulitis, a bacterial skin infection.
[01:48:37.916 --> 01:48:50.339]  On February 7, 2003, in the issue of Age Treatment News, doctors reported that they saw a large increase in aggressive, antibiotic-resistant staff, skin infections in gay men in D.C.
[01:48:50.379 --> 01:48:51.239]  And it just goes on.
[01:48:51.259 --> 01:48:58.241]  They talk about how he lives with one of his staff members, but it's like the FBI Director Hoover.
[01:48:58.321 --> 01:49:02.442]  And listen, it's not just by accident that most of them are into this.
[01:49:04.266 --> 01:49:06.187]  This is being alleged by Wayne Madison.
[01:49:06.207 --> 01:49:09.589]  It's like alleging that mackerels swim in the North Atlantic.
[01:49:09.609 --> 01:49:14.771]  It's like alleging that belugas swim in the North Atlantic.
[01:49:14.791 --> 01:49:18.273]  It's like alleging the sun came up very well.
[01:49:19.053 --> 01:49:20.534]  And it just goes into all of it.
[01:49:23.176 --> 01:49:25.016]  We've got several reports here from Wayne Madison.
[01:49:25.036 --> 01:49:27.338]  We've got him on for an hour and a half tomorrow.
[01:49:28.858 --> 01:49:30.199]  I'll get into the other stuff.
[01:49:30.259 --> 01:49:31.240]  It gets much worse.
[01:49:32.780 --> 01:49:33.881]  But that's how it works.
[01:49:34.517 --> 01:49:37.302]  You're part of this network, and they go, hey, why don't you run for Congress?
[01:49:37.322 --> 01:49:38.424]  Why don't you run for city council?
[01:49:39.506 --> 01:49:39.806]  You know.
[01:49:41.268 --> 01:49:45.776]  And so, it's a network of pervs running the government.
[01:49:46.938 --> 01:49:47.499]  We'll be right back.
[01:49:55.786 --> 01:49:58.967]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[01:49:59.307 --> 01:50:01.247]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[01:50:01.607 --> 01:50:09.269]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:50:09.949 --> 01:50:16.990]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:50:17.411 --> 01:50:20.331]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran.
[01:50:20.711 --> 01:50:23.032]  A White House program to disseminate fake news.
[01:50:23.452 --> 01:50:24.152]  NSA Sky.
[01:50:24.701 --> 01:50:26.502]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:50:26.542 --> 01:50:30.505]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:50:52.603 --> 01:50:55.786]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[01:50:55.826 --> 01:50:59.869]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[01:50:59.989 --> 01:51:02.551]  But if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[01:51:02.611 --> 01:51:04.953]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[01:51:05.133 --> 01:51:13.580]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 psi, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[01:51:13.660 --> 01:51:14.961]  The Berkey Light is different.
[01:51:15.101 --> 01:51:19.104]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[01:51:19.124 --> 01:51:23.226]  It is so powerful it purifies raw, untreated water from remote lakes, streams, and stagnant ponds.
[01:51:39.634 --> 01:51:44.481]  Get the Advanced Berkey Light Purifier for only $279 by calling New Millennium, 888-803-4438 or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[01:51:44.541 --> 01:51:45.663]  Not yet available in Iowa.

[01:52:59.918 --> 01:53:02.360]  We're going to continue with your phone calls into the third hour.
[01:53:04.941 --> 01:53:11.626]  Also, I'll get into the Skull and Bones Bohemian Grove connection to what's happening with Hastert and Foley and the rest of it.
[01:53:11.666 --> 01:53:14.808]  Also, Gore and Murdoch joined forces in a new TV deal.
[01:53:14.848 --> 01:53:19.131]  It's like Hillary and Murdoch and Bill Clinton vacationing with the Bushes.
[01:53:19.251 --> 01:53:21.472]  It's all staged, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:53:22.653 --> 01:53:24.374]  It's all staged.
[01:53:25.248 --> 01:53:27.270]  Kerry is saying he may run again.
[01:53:27.350 --> 01:53:30.072]  Of course, you can't just steal elections with electronic voting machines.
[01:53:30.392 --> 01:53:32.474]  You've got to have somebody who takes a dive again.
[01:53:33.755 --> 01:53:39.479]  But don't worry, the evangelicals, they don't blame the Republican Party.
[01:53:39.840 --> 01:53:41.040]  They blame Foley.
[01:53:42.061 --> 01:53:48.727]  And if it comes out that all the Republicans are homosexual or pedophiles, they'll suddenly say that's a sacrament.
[01:53:49.307 --> 01:53:51.148]  He must do it to be Christian.
[01:53:51.168 --> 01:53:54.191]  Because they're not really Christians, my friends.
[01:53:55.243 --> 01:53:59.484]  Before we end this hour, we have been broadcasting for an hour and 55 minutes.
[01:53:59.524 --> 01:54:02.104]  I have not plugged my videos yet.
[01:54:02.644 --> 01:54:04.285]  Number one, they're great in waking people up.
[01:54:04.865 --> 01:54:08.265]  Number two, if we don't get these out to people, we're not going to be operating.
[01:54:09.566 --> 01:54:10.726]  I made 15 films.
[01:54:10.786 --> 01:54:17.947]  America, Destroyed by Designs, or Police State 2000, Road to Tyranny, Masters of Terror, Martial Law, The Order of Death.
[01:54:18.627 --> 01:54:21.808]  And then we've got, of course, my newest film.
[01:54:23.226 --> 01:54:46.074]  Terror Storm with 68 minutes of extras, over three hours on one DVD, the history of terror, 9-11, 7-7, the Iraq War, the torture, buying fake media, 1.6 billion in fake news, total proof, wide spectrum analysis, jam-packed, very well produced, professional Hollywood score by the Golden Arm Trio.
[01:54:46.254 --> 01:54:47.795]  It's really my best work and
[01:54:49.042 --> 01:54:50.983]  It needs to be seen, so get it.
[01:54:51.043 --> 01:54:52.564]  Give it as an early Christmas present.
[01:54:52.924 --> 01:54:54.164]  Say, hey, here's your present early.
[01:54:54.184 --> 01:54:56.125]  We may be in World War III before then.
[01:54:56.145 --> 01:54:58.126]  You need to know who the terrorists are.
[01:54:58.786 --> 01:54:59.887]  Give it as a birthday present.
[01:54:59.907 --> 01:55:00.687]  Give it to your neighbor.
[01:55:00.827 --> 01:55:02.428]  Get one copy, make 100 copies.

[01:55:39.119 --> 01:55:39.520]  We're good to go.
[01:55:39.540 --> 01:55:39.680]  I think?

[01:56:22.611 --> 01:56:22.971]  We're good to go.
[01:56:22.991 --> 01:56:23.131]  I think?
[01:56:47.459 --> 01:56:49.900]  We'll buy 100 copies and give them to people if you can afford it.
[01:56:49.940 --> 01:56:50.681]  We need the support.
[01:56:51.181 --> 01:56:53.402]  But number one, we need the information to get out to folks.
[01:56:53.442 --> 01:56:54.203]  So 512-291-5750 or toll free.
[01:56:54.223 --> 01:56:55.283]  You can call for regular orders 1-877-996-4327.
[01:56:55.303 --> 01:56:55.944]  I'm losing my mind.
[01:56:55.964 --> 01:56:57.705]  That's the back line of the network.
[01:56:57.725 --> 01:56:57.825]  888-253-3139 888-253-3139
[01:57:16.710 --> 01:57:17.110]  To order.
[01:57:19.391 --> 01:57:22.913]  All right, we will start the second hour.
[01:57:22.933 --> 01:57:23.813]  We'll start the third hour.
[01:57:24.173 --> 01:57:29.156]  And then we will... I'm going to cover news for a little while after we take some calls.
[01:57:29.336 --> 01:57:30.296]  So it's all coming up.
[01:57:30.316 --> 01:57:31.557]  Stay with us.
[01:57:32.557 --> 01:57:36.459]  If you would like a copy of this show, come to GCNlive.com and reserve it today.
[01:57:36.779 --> 01:57:37.580]  Or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[01:57:47.899 --> 01:57:48.540]  Big Brother.
[01:57:49.200 --> 01:57:50.261]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:50.981 --> 01:57:52.082]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:52.723 --> 01:57:53.543]  You want answers?
[01:57:54.304 --> 01:57:55.245]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:55.885 --> 01:57:59.528]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:00.048 --> 01:58:04.151]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:04.812 --> 01:58:09.575]  Okay, let's get to some of these callers that have been holding for time immemorial in this third hour.
[01:58:09.595 --> 01:58:10.516]  And I did this Friday.
[01:58:10.536 --> 01:58:11.336]  I'm proud of myself.
[01:58:11.376 --> 01:58:15.519]  In this third hour, we will accelerate through your phone calls very quickly.
[01:58:15.539 --> 01:58:15.579]  1-800-
[01:58:17.858 --> 01:58:18.459]  2-5-9-92-31.
[01:58:18.519 --> 01:58:24.084]  Then I'm going to get into Gore and Murdoch joint forces and TV deal.
[01:58:24.785 --> 01:58:26.167]  Kerry saying he may run again.
[01:58:26.207 --> 01:58:27.448]  He ought to throw the election again.
[01:58:27.468 --> 01:58:28.489]  This is so staged.
[01:58:29.167 --> 01:58:40.577]  We'll recap some of the top info on the North Korean nuke test and what that means and get more into Foley and how the pervert scandal could bring down the GOP and how that makes them more dangerous than ever to stage a terror attack.
[01:58:40.657 --> 01:58:44.461]  Also, British Special Forces are saying Iran is not sneaking weapons in.
[01:58:44.481 --> 01:58:45.782]  They're not bringing troops across.
[01:58:46.082 --> 01:58:46.843]  It's a total lie.
[01:58:46.863 --> 01:58:47.944]  That's in the Washington Post.
[01:58:48.324 --> 01:58:49.165]  We'll go over that.
[01:58:49.545 --> 01:58:52.167]  Tons of news, tons of your calls in this third hour.
[01:58:52.628 --> 01:58:53.008]  Right now.
[01:58:53.048 --> 01:58:53.649]  Who's up next?
[01:58:53.789 --> 01:58:55.070]  I get my call list screwed up here.
[01:58:56.320 --> 01:58:58.544]  KC in Minnesota, then Dave, Chris, George, and others.
[01:58:58.584 --> 01:58:59.245]  Go ahead, KC.
[01:58:59.846 --> 01:59:00.327]  Hey, Alex.
[01:59:01.789 --> 01:59:03.211]  I wanted to run a couple things by you.
[01:59:03.311 --> 01:59:06.797]  I think that there's a real strong possibility that this Foleygate thing
[01:59:07.392 --> 01:59:12.974]  May have been used as a fear factor element in order to encourage our largely corrupted Congress into voting for H.R.
[01:59:13.714 --> 01:59:12.974]  6166.
[01:59:14.895 --> 01:59:22.037]  I said that about a week ago I came to the conclusion that we know they have compromised people to begin with.
[01:59:22.397 --> 01:59:24.398]  They knew they couldn't cover this up forever.
[01:59:24.458 --> 01:59:25.518]  It was starting to come out.
[01:59:25.878 --> 01:59:31.600]  And it's clear that the mainstream media decided to go ahead and bring it out now as a fear factor.
[01:59:31.620 --> 01:59:33.981]  It was brought out two days before it began to leak.
[01:59:34.761 --> 01:59:36.783]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:59:37.003 --> 01:59:53.996]  Would you think it would be like a decision made by some element within the corporate media?
[01:59:54.476 --> 01:59:56.018]  Yeah, I don't think it comes from Bush.
[01:59:56.058 --> 02:00:01.102]  This endangers Bush and his neocon crowd because they really go to the well quite a bit.
[02:00:01.182 --> 02:00:02.883]  I mean, this is where you find the tightest...
[02:00:03.584 --> 02:00:08.710]  Well, when you consider the magnitude and the actual timing of both of the votes, which is, I mean, it's
[02:00:23.425 --> 02:00:26.830]  It kills habeas corpus and backdates everything retrospectively to 9-11, right?
[02:00:26.950 --> 02:00:27.831]  Well, you're right.
[02:00:28.111 --> 02:00:32.277]  And we also know the top generals are telling them we can't go into Iran, it's crazy, we shouldn't bomb them.
[02:00:32.658 --> 02:00:39.427]  And this could be Israel and others' way of just saying, look, we will slit this party's throat.
[02:00:40.528 --> 02:00:42.068]  We will drop the hammer on you.
[02:00:42.109 --> 02:00:43.850]  We will kick the lever on the gallows.
[02:00:44.250 --> 02:00:50.554]  If you don't go ahead and invade, attack, and then don't worry, once World War III starts, everything will be okay.
[02:00:51.014 --> 02:00:56.637]  This thing does have the hallmarks of a blackmail scheme, and I do smell it.
[02:00:57.058 --> 02:01:00.140]  Yeah, it seems like it's out there as kind of like an ominous threat.
[02:01:00.480 --> 02:01:08.705]  Another thing I wanted to point out that came up in the news recently is that several hundred police officers in Iraq were poisoned.
[02:01:09.474 --> 02:01:10.696]  Yeah, that happened last night.
[02:01:10.716 --> 02:01:12.178]  They got poisoned.
[02:01:12.198 --> 02:01:13.801]  I think their water was poisoned.
[02:01:13.861 --> 02:01:19.149]  It almost seems like it's some type of blood thinning agent or like warfarin or rat poison or something like that.
[02:01:19.907 --> 02:01:22.748]  I don't know what that's all about, but I was wondering if I could get your take on that.
[02:01:22.768 --> 02:01:34.470]  Well, the Arabs do kill each other, but most of the infighting has been triggered by special forces, U.S., Israeli, and British, staging attacks against one side to then get them fighting with the other.
[02:01:34.870 --> 02:01:38.271]  And then as soon as things settle down, they start this stuff back up.
[02:01:38.311 --> 02:01:41.612]  And I told people that in 2002, a year before the invasion...
[02:01:42.307 --> 02:01:42.867]  That the U.S.
[02:01:42.947 --> 02:01:49.610]  and Israeli plans were to balkanize endless sectarian and religious violence between the Kurds, the Shiites, and the Sunnis.
[02:01:50.230 --> 02:01:53.151]  And now that's happened.
[02:01:53.452 --> 02:01:58.273]  And now the Times of London, oh, the government's calling to break the country in three.
[02:01:58.353 --> 02:01:59.354]  It's a new idea.
[02:01:59.754 --> 02:02:00.754]  It was never new.
[02:02:01.075 --> 02:02:03.456]  The plan was hatched by the Israelis in 83.
[02:02:03.876 --> 02:02:05.336]  And they're now doing it again.
[02:02:05.416 --> 02:02:06.957]  They want it in chaos.
[02:02:07.337 --> 02:02:09.118]  The average person goes, we've got to stay the course.
[02:02:09.178 --> 02:02:09.918]  Yeah, stuff's tough.
[02:02:10.218 --> 02:02:11.859]  They want it in chaos.
[02:02:12.279 --> 02:02:15.362]  As an excuse to stay there and for hundreds of billions in weapons sales.
[02:02:16.403 --> 02:02:21.228]  I kind of didn't think it would be the Iranians because it was so close to Ramadan, you know.
[02:02:23.090 --> 02:02:24.532]  Who knows who it could be.
[02:02:24.732 --> 02:02:30.238]  But again, the Iranians, most of it is the globalists.
[02:02:30.438 --> 02:02:31.319]  I appreciate your call.
[02:02:32.100 --> 02:02:32.620]  But who knows?
[02:02:32.660 --> 02:02:33.541]  Again, I said I don't know.
[02:02:33.581 --> 02:02:34.402]  They do kill each other.
[02:02:35.254 --> 02:02:39.456]  But if our government's been caught over and over doing it, they're the number one suspects, my point.
[02:02:39.736 --> 02:02:40.337]  We'll be right back.
[02:02:46.700 --> 02:02:49.901]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[02:02:50.242 --> 02:02:52.183]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[02:02:52.543 --> 02:03:00.207]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:03:00.887 --> 02:03:02.648]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11
[02:03:03.416 --> 02:03:04.417]  An inside job.
[02:03:04.617 --> 02:03:07.918]  But the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:03:08.319 --> 02:03:11.260]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran.
[02:03:11.640 --> 02:03:19.745]  A White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:03:20.065 --> 02:03:23.567]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:03:24.027 --> 02:03:25.948]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:03:26.288 --> 02:03:30.110]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:04:40.262 --> 02:04:42.143]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:04:43.584 --> 02:04:45.746]  Admit it, the moral rot in America runs deep.
[02:04:46.146 --> 02:04:52.750]  Massive debt, rampant materialism, pedophilia by clergy, endless war, and yes, the sin of religious cannibalism.
[02:04:53.031 --> 02:04:59.455]  Communion was practiced by the Aztecs, Egyptians, Babylonians, and Gnostics of the mystery schools long before the Messiah was born.
[02:04:59.775 --> 02:05:02.437]  Due to carefully placed forgeries within the New Covenant texts,
[02:05:02.697 --> 02:05:02.797]  Yeah.
[02:05:28.847 --> 02:05:33.531]  Nostics did hijack the Antique to fulfill their devious plan to make abomination look holy.
[02:05:33.551 --> 02:05:37.795]  Gnostic conspiracy exposed in Communion, the Blood Fest of Babylon.
[02:05:38.035 --> 02:05:38.235]  Call 325-572-3913.
[02:05:48.144 --> 02:05:48.785]  Big Brother.
[02:05:49.445 --> 02:05:50.526]  Mainstream media.
[02:05:51.207 --> 02:05:52.328]  Government cover-ups.
[02:05:52.988 --> 02:05:53.809]  You want answers?
[02:05:54.549 --> 02:05:55.430]  Well, so does he.
[02:05:56.111 --> 02:06:00.094]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:00.314 --> 02:06:04.437]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:06:07.119 --> 02:06:14.965]  The Wayne Manship Report...
[02:06:16.431 --> 02:06:17.792]  Has really done a great job.
[02:06:20.693 --> 02:06:38.321]  They broke the story before it was in the Associated Press and the Washington Post about a congressman in 2000, Representative Jim Kolb, Republican Arizona, who had approached Foley in 2000 and told him to stop what he was doing, that it was endangering the party.
[02:06:40.742 --> 02:06:42.643]  And so, I mean, they've been a really good source.
[02:06:43.123 --> 02:06:44.504]  And they are reporting that
[02:06:45.350 --> 02:06:47.330]  Hastert is a homosexual.
[02:06:47.550 --> 02:06:50.951]  That Hastert hires call boys.
[02:06:51.211 --> 02:06:53.712]  That Hastert lives with one of his senior staff members.
[02:06:54.352 --> 02:06:55.392]  And it's always that way.
[02:06:55.432 --> 02:06:59.193]  It's like J. Edgar Hoover was the number two of the FBI for 30-something years.
[02:06:59.233 --> 02:07:00.073]  They lived together.
[02:07:00.093 --> 02:07:02.194]  I mean, they lived together in front of everyone.
[02:07:03.694 --> 02:07:09.215]  And this is why he got up in, what was it, 1956 and said, It's a conspiracy theory.
[02:07:09.235 --> 02:07:13.236]  La Cosa Nostra, the mafia, does not exist.
[02:07:15.382 --> 02:07:19.005]  And now Hastert will get up and say, the North American Union does not exist.
[02:07:20.026 --> 02:07:23.208]  All right, I want to get more into that later.
[02:07:24.089 --> 02:07:39.902]  But you add this wild card of Kim Jong-il testing a nuke yesterday, saying he may test more, Japan going absolutely ape, saying they may scrap their defense constitution, saying they can't be preemptive or have an offensive military.
[02:07:40.262 --> 02:07:42.764]  They've been covertly building up their military the last decade.
[02:07:43.747 --> 02:07:46.950]  We've got Israel saying, never mind North Korea, it's Iran.
[02:07:47.070 --> 02:07:48.791]  Now North Korea will arm them.
[02:07:48.811 --> 02:07:52.514]  And no doubt the neocons are all over talk radio saying that today.
[02:07:54.176 --> 02:07:55.317]  All of this is swirling.
[02:07:55.417 --> 02:07:56.858]  It's just unbelievable.
[02:07:57.578 --> 02:07:58.559]  Let's go back to your calls.
[02:07:58.579 --> 02:08:03.743]  Let's talk to Dave in... Where are you calling us from, Dave?
[02:08:03.763 --> 02:08:05.285]  Southern California, brother.
[02:08:05.485 --> 02:08:05.945]  Welcome, sir.
[02:08:05.985 --> 02:08:06.606]  What's on your mind?
[02:08:07.006 --> 02:08:08.467]  I've got a little quickie statement.
[02:08:08.487 --> 02:08:09.248]  I've written it out.
[02:08:09.989 --> 02:08:10.149]  And...
[02:08:11.141 --> 02:08:12.601]  Congratulations on KLBJ.
[02:08:12.621 --> 02:08:13.962]  You're an inspiration to us all.
[02:08:15.082 --> 02:08:25.244]  Remember when Manuel Noriega was grabbed in the Panama War and then a couple years later he came on 60 Minutes or one of those special shows and kept saying over and over, they'd ask him, you know, who was your cocaine partner?
[02:08:25.284 --> 02:08:27.144]  And he'd say, George Herbert Walker Bush.
[02:08:27.164 --> 02:08:27.744]  Do you remember that?
[02:08:28.244 --> 02:08:28.544]  Yes.
[02:08:28.844 --> 02:08:29.064]  Okay.
[02:08:29.344 --> 02:08:31.365]  And he did it over and over and then, of course, he disappeared.
[02:08:31.425 --> 02:08:38.446]  Well, what I have to say is, so, who was in the White House when underage male prostitutes toured after midnight?
[02:08:38.874 --> 02:08:40.335]  George Herbert Walker Bush.
[02:08:40.795 --> 02:08:43.276]  And who uses sex as blackmail?
[02:08:43.796 --> 02:08:45.357]  George Herbert Walker Bush.
[02:08:45.577 --> 02:08:52.501]  And who was it that armed Saddam with biological chemical nuke technology in over 750 shipments?
[02:08:53.001 --> 02:08:54.342]  George Herbert Walker Bush.
[02:08:54.482 --> 02:09:02.926]  And who was it who traded arms with Iran and the Contras and imported cocaine from South America and coined the phrase plausible deniability?
[02:09:03.422 --> 02:09:09.119]  It was George Herbert Walker Bush, and whose father Prescott was a huge Nazi during World War II.
[02:09:09.890 --> 02:09:12.032]  That was George Herbert Walker Bush.
[02:09:12.292 --> 02:09:14.293]  I'm not blowing you out on the phone, am I?
[02:09:14.593 --> 02:09:16.455]  No, but they're good Americans.
[02:09:16.535 --> 02:09:18.176]  What do you mean they're Christians?
[02:09:18.916 --> 02:09:20.818]  CIA directors and U.S.
[02:09:20.878 --> 02:09:22.959]  ambassadors to China when it was opened up.
[02:09:23.299 --> 02:09:25.701]  He's a man of the Lord.
[02:09:25.721 --> 02:09:28.783]  Don't talk about this man of God like that.
[02:09:28.843 --> 02:09:33.606]  I hear him on the so-called Christian stations saying it's blasphemy to talk bad about him.
[02:09:34.787 --> 02:09:35.668]  May I continue, sir?
[02:09:36.915 --> 02:09:40.457]  It's pretty evil, these lies you're telling, even though it's all admitted.
[02:09:40.477 --> 02:09:41.578]  Sure, go ahead.
[02:09:41.898 --> 02:09:42.399]  Okay, thank you.
[02:09:42.859 --> 02:09:50.324]  Who was silent partners with General Secord and Lansdale to import heroin from Vietnam, Thailand, and Burma?
[02:09:50.544 --> 02:09:57.568]  That was George Herbert Walker Bush, who was in the background during the Bay of Pigs and later during the development of Operation Northwoods.
[02:09:58.008 --> 02:09:59.569]  George Herbert Walker Bush.
[02:09:59.910 --> 02:10:05.093]  Who helped get Felix Rodriguez and Jose Correa out of jail after they blew up a Cuban jetliner?
[02:10:05.575 --> 02:10:07.336]  That was George Herbert Walker Bush.
[02:10:07.736 --> 02:10:08.997]  Who called Saddam?
[02:10:09.457 --> 02:10:10.037]  He's a Hitler.
[02:10:10.677 --> 02:10:12.478]  That was George Herbert Walker Bush.
[02:10:12.838 --> 02:10:14.319]  Hot meat kettle on that one.
[02:10:14.979 --> 02:10:19.301]  Who did Ross Perot say threatened his daughter and caused Perot to drop out of the race?
[02:10:19.402 --> 02:10:21.042]  That was George Herbert Walker Bush.
[02:10:21.202 --> 02:10:24.704]  Who was the first drug czar under Reagan when hard drug use tripled?
[02:10:25.084 --> 02:10:26.705]  George Herbert Walker Bush.

[02:10:33.752 --> 02:10:44.680]  Who was the president when they buried thousands and thousands of Iraqis alive with bulldozers in Iraq 1 in trenches and then covered that crime up?
[02:10:44.740 --> 02:10:46.221]  That was George Herbert Walker Bush.
[02:10:46.261 --> 02:10:51.545]  Who ordered the mass bombing of retreating Iraqi troops out of two highways of death in Iraq 1?
[02:10:52.026 --> 02:10:53.167]  George Herbert Walker Bush.
[02:10:53.207 --> 02:10:55.789]  Who was photographed at the Dallas Book Depository?
[02:10:55.889 --> 02:10:58.971]  Who ordered the first use of depleted uranium in warfare?
[02:10:59.031 --> 02:11:00.592]  George Herbert Walker Bush.
[02:11:00.672 --> 02:11:01.193]  Oh, that's scary.
[02:11:01.233 --> 02:11:01.973]  I didn't know that one.
[02:11:02.494 --> 02:11:02.974]  Who did...
[02:11:03.433 --> 02:11:06.134]  J. Edgar Hoover name in the JFK assassination.
[02:11:06.214 --> 02:11:06.935]  George Bush.
[02:11:07.035 --> 02:11:08.315]  The Herbert Walker was silent.
[02:11:08.856 --> 02:11:14.298]  Who was vice president, I'm almost done, when Russians were lured into the Afghan war?
[02:11:14.358 --> 02:11:15.479]  Who sent them stingers?
[02:11:15.519 --> 02:11:19.480]  Who was involved with bin Laden funneling weapons to the Afghan freedom fighters?
[02:11:19.821 --> 02:11:22.842]  Who stood to gain from the assassination of Ronald Reagan?
[02:11:23.262 --> 02:11:29.345]  Who is the sick freak behind the meat puppet George W. Bush?
[02:11:30.034 --> 02:11:31.795]  George Herbert Walker Bush.
[02:11:32.216 --> 02:11:34.117]  Are we seeing a pattern here, people?
[02:11:34.257 --> 02:11:37.140]  And I also am sick of it!
[02:11:37.920 --> 02:11:41.223]  I am a free citizen of the United States of America.
[02:11:41.723 --> 02:11:50.571]  My name is David Christopher Short, and I accuse George Herbert Walker Bush of treason, high crimes, and misdemeanors.
[02:11:51.011 --> 02:11:54.594]  I accuse George Herbert Walker Bush of crimes against humanity.
[02:11:54.614 --> 02:11:55.434]  I accuse...
[02:11:56.491 --> 02:12:02.453]  George Herbert Walker Bush of being one of the biggest dope dealers in history, of being one of the biggest mass murderers in history.
[02:12:02.473 --> 02:12:03.533]  Oh no, he's good.
[02:12:03.553 --> 02:12:10.936]  I accuse him of war crimes and I demand that American law enforcement arrest George Herbert Walker Bush right now!
[02:12:11.436 --> 02:12:19.238]  But wait, since the drugs have tripled, they make so much money, they got fancy black uniforms and machine guns, and their numbers have more than tripled too.
[02:12:19.338 --> 02:12:20.298]  I mean, how dare you?
[02:12:20.338 --> 02:12:21.619]  We need to take the freedom.
[02:12:22.159 --> 02:12:23.839]  Well, you sound so reasonable.
[02:12:23.899 --> 02:12:25.840]  We love George Herbert Walker.
[02:12:25.880 --> 02:12:26.920]  He's a good man.
[02:12:26.940 --> 02:12:28.440]  Hitler was good.
[02:12:28.460 --> 02:12:31.741]  So what if his father helped Hitler?
[02:12:32.181 --> 02:12:37.902]  Now, they really are an evil family, but it gets even scarier when you realize they're a super high-level servant family.
[02:12:38.402 --> 02:12:40.642]  Well, it's like George Bush said he was in 1985.
[02:12:41.062 --> 02:12:43.083]  He said, I'm a Rockefeller Republican.
[02:12:43.783 --> 02:12:44.283]  Yeah, I hear you.
[02:12:44.643 --> 02:12:49.044]  So you notice Henry Kissinger every week is at the White House, and they now admit he's calling all the shots.
[02:12:49.644 --> 02:12:50.744]  Eighty-something years old.
[02:12:51.559 --> 02:12:55.123]  By the way, I have a quote for you that I made of myself real fast.
[02:13:13.905 --> 02:13:17.447]  There are two parts of the Constitution of the United States left in this country.
[02:13:17.727 --> 02:13:22.551]  The one is that it exists in the hearts and minds of free men and women in this country, like you and me.
[02:13:23.111 --> 02:13:28.274]  And the other is a little tiny part of the Second Amendment, and that's the part you put the cartridges in.
[02:13:29.435 --> 02:13:29.835]  I hear you.
[02:13:29.855 --> 02:13:30.896]  I appreciate your call.
[02:13:30.916 --> 02:13:35.679]  Yeah, they can declare themselves God and declare themselves emperors and say we're all slaves.
[02:13:36.199 --> 02:13:37.020]  It's all a fraud.
[02:13:37.600 --> 02:13:40.002]  And if you put up with being oppressed, you will be oppressed.
[02:13:41.136 --> 02:13:43.498]  And if you haven't experienced it, get ready for it.
[02:13:44.079 --> 02:13:49.203]  It is humiliating, it is pathetic, and there are going to be a lot of bullies who are going to love being part of this system.
[02:13:50.865 --> 02:13:56.570]  And they'll be glorified by television, they'll be glorified, all the supermodels will, I married a stormtrooper!
[02:13:56.910 --> 02:14:04.336]  Tonight, the men of the SS Brigade, defending the homeland against the evil militia that kills children.
[02:14:05.601 --> 02:14:08.462]  Emperor Bush battles the Silesians.
[02:14:08.542 --> 02:14:11.423]  I mean, it's just made-up baloney, folks.
[02:14:12.584 --> 02:14:18.146]  Let's go ahead and talk to Chris in Montreal Holding for a while.
[02:14:18.206 --> 02:14:18.806]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:14:19.486 --> 02:14:19.687]  Hi, Chris.
[02:14:19.747 --> 02:14:20.267]  How are you doing?
[02:14:20.627 --> 02:14:20.847]  Sorry.
[02:14:21.027 --> 02:14:21.347]  Hi, Alex.
[02:14:21.367 --> 02:14:21.847]  How are you doing?
[02:14:21.907 --> 02:14:22.908]  Hey, you can call me Chris if you want.
[02:14:22.968 --> 02:14:23.228]  Sure.
[02:14:24.128 --> 02:14:25.469]  I'm doing all right here.
[02:14:25.509 --> 02:14:25.849]  Go ahead.
[02:14:25.889 --> 02:14:27.950]  We've been seized by total psychopathic criminals.
[02:14:27.970 --> 02:14:28.310]  Go ahead.
[02:14:29.678 --> 02:14:36.883]  Well, first I'd like to say something, but I also want to say after that a few tidbits of information that you might not know about related to Canada and some other things.
[02:14:37.684 --> 02:14:42.787]  First, I'd like to make a call on all Montrealers and Quebecers who actually care and want to make a difference in the world.
[02:14:43.228 --> 02:14:48.391]  If they want to do activism or hand out DVDs, to email me at azixc at hotmail dot com.
[02:14:48.952 --> 02:14:50.032]  You've got to say it slower.
[02:14:50.072 --> 02:14:50.713]  What is that again?
[02:14:51.253 --> 02:14:52.754]  azixc at hotmail dot com.
[02:14:52.794 --> 02:14:53.335]  azixc dot com.
[02:14:57.296 --> 02:14:57.776]  I-X-E.
[02:14:58.437 --> 02:14:59.497]  I-X-E, alrighty.
[02:15:00.978 --> 02:15:03.299]  So then we can get together and think of ideas or whatever.
[02:15:03.619 --> 02:15:05.079]  Good, what's on your mind, Commander?
[02:15:05.099 --> 02:15:21.627]  Alright, so I don't know if you noticed, but the last few articles I've seen where they have YouTube videos, these videos get removed and a few days later, because I'm behind on my checking up of news, so days later I check up on the news and I can't watch the videos and they all relate to bad things the government has done...
[02:15:22.805 --> 02:15:26.506]  Admissions of politicians or things like that, they always get removed after a few days.
[02:15:26.526 --> 02:15:29.647]  So I think there's people on the ball over there that keep removing the truth.
[02:15:30.447 --> 02:15:31.287]  I don't know if you've noticed.
[02:15:31.607 --> 02:15:36.409]  Well, yeah, and Google is trying to buy Wall Street Journal reported YouTube.
[02:15:36.429 --> 02:15:37.569]  They reported that on Friday.
[02:15:37.589 --> 02:15:46.992]  And in between Google Video and YouTube, that's like 80% of the online video viewing market, you could call it.
[02:15:47.552 --> 02:15:51.333]  And Google admits they deleted my viewerships again last week.
[02:15:52.017 --> 02:15:54.518]  Every time we get into the top 100, they do it.
[02:15:54.898 --> 02:15:58.639]  We got as high as about 70 in the top 100 videos.
[02:15:58.679 --> 02:16:02.741]  And I mean, tens of millions a day watch these folks, Google videos.
[02:16:03.041 --> 02:16:06.402]  So we're being cheated yet again, and they claim it's a glitch.
[02:16:07.322 --> 02:16:07.962]  Yeah, that's crazy.
[02:16:08.002 --> 02:16:16.945]  We need to get some other independent YouTube, Google company going that's not restricted and all this stuff, because it would be really good to get that information out without all the restriction.
[02:16:17.926 --> 02:16:18.986]  Another piece of information.
[02:16:19.670 --> 02:16:20.851]  Well, I'm concerned they're using DU.
[02:16:20.871 --> 02:16:23.012]  It's conserved up into most of the weapon systems.
[02:16:23.032 --> 02:16:23.692]  Even in North America?
[02:16:49.250 --> 02:16:49.670]  Uh, yes.
[02:16:50.130 --> 02:16:53.411]  Oh, boy, that's... They use it at ten proving grounds publicly.
[02:16:53.711 --> 02:16:54.671]  That's old numbers.
[02:16:54.731 --> 02:16:56.031]  I would imagine it's a lot more now.
[02:16:56.051 --> 02:16:57.052]  Oh, boy.
[02:16:57.352 --> 02:16:58.072]  I didn't know about that.
[02:16:59.012 --> 02:17:05.473]  Um, another thing in Montreal last week on Wednesday, we're now having helicopter terror drills going on in Montreal.
[02:17:05.553 --> 02:17:06.554]  I saw that, yes.
[02:17:06.994 --> 02:17:09.494]  And those are martial law takeover drills is what they are.
[02:17:09.634 --> 02:17:10.694]  Yeah, it frightened me.
[02:17:10.734 --> 02:17:11.915]  I didn't know what the hell was going on.
[02:17:11.975 --> 02:17:14.495]  It's to train you so when they really do it, you don't get shocked.
[02:17:14.575 --> 02:17:15.695]  Oh, they've done that before.
[02:17:16.276 --> 02:17:18.176]  They practice taking over all your city halls.
[02:17:19.412 --> 02:17:21.594]  In case the people and mayors go, we're not doing this!
[02:17:21.674 --> 02:17:22.495]  Income commandos.
[02:17:22.735 --> 02:17:24.136]  Just, mayor, line them up!
[02:17:24.597 --> 02:17:25.157]  Boom!
[02:17:25.257 --> 02:17:26.318]  Goes the mayor's head.
[02:17:26.338 --> 02:17:27.299]  Hoorah!
[02:17:27.319 --> 02:17:28.220]  America dies!
[02:17:28.300 --> 02:17:29.041]  Canada dies!
[02:17:29.301 --> 02:17:30.222]  Up with world government!
[02:17:30.562 --> 02:17:30.882]  Yes!
[02:17:31.122 --> 02:17:32.784]  Kill the leadership of every major city!
[02:17:33.064 --> 02:17:34.185]  Hail the new world order!
[02:17:34.385 --> 02:17:35.486]  Hail, hail, hail!
[02:17:35.546 --> 02:17:36.267]  Death to freedom!
[02:17:36.507 --> 02:17:37.168]  Death, death!
[02:17:37.408 --> 02:17:38.889]  Power, power to the scum!
[02:17:38.929 --> 02:17:40.931]  Yes, we rule it off!
[02:17:43.849 --> 02:17:45.690]  Dad, can we stop?
[02:17:46.030 --> 02:17:47.551]  We need to go to the bathroom.
[02:17:47.972 --> 02:17:48.212]  What?
[02:17:48.572 --> 02:17:48.932]  Again?
[02:17:49.352 --> 02:17:50.973]  We just stopped two hours ago.
[02:17:51.053 --> 02:17:55.476]  Honey, let's stop, because I gave the kids their spark-burkey water bottles.
[02:17:55.696 --> 02:17:56.997]  Why did you do that?
[02:17:57.197 --> 02:18:03.000]  Because they can't drink and talk at the same time, and that way we don't have to listen to them singing, Are we there yet?
[02:18:03.301 --> 02:18:04.321]  Are we there yet?
[02:18:04.421 --> 02:18:05.502]  for the entire trip.
[02:18:05.742 --> 02:18:07.943]  Hmm, I didn't think about that.
[02:18:08.424 --> 02:18:09.444]  Great idea.
[02:18:09.724 --> 02:18:12.226]  Yeah, and it's cheap entertainment for the kids.
[02:18:12.665 --> 02:18:15.130]  Bottled water costs around 75 cents a bottle.
[02:18:15.330 --> 02:18:19.718]  And using our Berkey Sport bottles, it costs us less than two and a half cents per refill.
[02:18:19.999 --> 02:18:20.320]  Honey!
[02:18:21.127 --> 02:18:22.388]  You're terrific!
[02:18:22.768 --> 02:18:24.268]  Oh, honey, so are you.
[02:18:24.368 --> 02:18:27.770]  You're the one that bought the family our sport Berkey water bottles.
[02:18:28.070 --> 02:18:28.851]  Now can we stop?
[02:18:29.351 --> 02:18:30.071]  I need to go, too.
[02:18:30.391 --> 02:18:34.833]  Get your Berkey Sport Purification Bottle for only $39 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:18:34.893 --> 02:18:35.093]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:18:35.113 --> 02:18:36.394]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[02:18:45.246 --> 02:18:46.287]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:18:46.687 --> 02:18:52.171]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[02:18:52.751 --> 02:18:53.251]  That's right.
[02:18:53.552 --> 02:18:55.853]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[02:18:56.173 --> 02:19:03.318]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[02:19:03.883 --> 02:19:11.587]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds, and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[02:19:12.027 --> 02:19:16.830]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[02:19:17.509 --> 02:19:22.511]  If you'd like to take a look at gold-free retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[02:19:23.312 --> 02:19:27.453]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[02:19:27.833 --> 02:19:28.074]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:19:28.094 --> 02:19:30.034]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[02:19:30.094 --> 02:19:30.395]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:19:30.695 --> 02:19:30.975]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:19:43.891 --> 02:19:46.373]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network.
[02:19:46.493 --> 02:19:48.854]  I have an urgent message for all of our listeners.
[02:19:48.914 --> 02:19:55.119]  The mass media keeps telling us that we are the richest, most powerful economy in the world.
[02:19:56.580 --> 02:19:58.881]  If this is true, why can't we pay our bills?
[02:19:59.542 --> 02:20:03.084]  Why is the United States the world's largest debtor nation?
[02:20:03.625 --> 02:20:07.767]  The truth is that we are in the worst debt bubble in our nation's history.
[02:20:08.348 --> 02:20:11.290]  When the bubble bursts, will you be able to feed your family?
[02:20:12.276 --> 02:20:15.197]  When the inevitable crash occurs, will you be ready?
[02:20:15.938 --> 02:20:21.940]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.
[02:20:22.020 --> 02:20:25.022]  That's 1-888-892-6238.
[02:20:25.262 --> 02:20:29.844]  For the following two free reports, U.S.
[02:20:29.944 --> 02:20:32.845]  Debt Bubble, Red Alert, and Real Estate Crash.
[02:20:33.805 --> 02:20:36.106]  Call 888-8XANADU.
[02:20:36.167 --> 02:20:40.328]  That's 888-8XANADU.
[02:20:40.688 --> 02:20:41.649]  And ask for George.
[02:20:43.271 --> 02:20:46.533]  You know, I really wish I could just power my place with solar.
[02:20:48.074 --> 02:20:54.278]  That's what I was saying to myself over and over again for years until I found out about Ken Solar.
[02:20:54.598 --> 02:21:01.181]  Ken has been working with solar power for over a decade and has designed systems for people all over the world.
[02:21:01.562 --> 02:21:10.627]  He's put together customized alternative energy packages for everything from powering the local supermarket all the way down to portable solar power generators.
[02:21:11.207 --> 02:21:22.356]  On-grid, off-grid, big systems or tiny systems, Ken has the proven experience to design a tailored alternative energy system that's just right for you and your budget.
[02:21:22.717 --> 02:21:26.980]  He'll also show you how a system can pay for itself in the first month.
[02:21:27.381 --> 02:21:30.183]  So if you're looking for solar, check out Ken Solar.
[02:21:30.403 --> 02:21:35.747]  Tell Ken you heard about him on GCN, and he'll give you an additional 10% off your order.
[02:21:36.048 --> 02:21:38.950]  Just point your browser at kensolar.com.
[02:21:38.970 --> 02:21:39.531]  That's Ken...
[02:21:40.251 --> 02:21:41.672]  Solar.com.
[02:22:02.231 --> 02:22:06.194]  Rick and Kevin, I'm going to go to you guys right now, and I'm going to come back and get into some of the news we haven't hit yet.
[02:22:06.214 --> 02:22:07.435]  It's all very important.
[02:22:07.756 --> 02:22:15.121]  Recap some top stories, then go back into calls at 1-800-259-9231 on this Monday edition.
[02:22:15.802 --> 02:22:20.646]  Huge escalation, as you know, in Asia with the North Korean atomic test.
[02:22:21.106 --> 02:22:22.567]  Now they're talking about doing more.
[02:22:23.728 --> 02:22:26.190]  All of this Foley scandal, all of it.
[02:22:26.310 --> 02:22:29.953]  The troops massing, the aircraft carriers massing for a strike on Iran.
[02:22:30.842 --> 02:22:32.784]  Follow the bouncing ball where it stops.
[02:22:32.864 --> 02:22:33.565]  Nobody knows.
[02:22:34.065 --> 02:22:35.927]  Let's go ahead and talk to George in Indiana.
[02:22:35.967 --> 02:22:36.908]  George, you're on the air.
[02:22:37.549 --> 02:22:38.109]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:22:38.870 --> 02:22:43.454]  Just to give you an update here in Indiana, I-69 is having a real struggle.
[02:22:43.534 --> 02:22:44.315]  Nobody wants it.
[02:22:45.056 --> 02:22:48.219]  It's real ugly to see how they're going through the farmland down through here.
[02:22:48.739 --> 02:22:51.502]  And, in fact, some people have been told that they're going to lose their homes.
[02:22:52.203 --> 02:22:54.465]  But they're fighting it in every county.
[02:22:55.642 --> 02:23:00.323]  Second thing I want to mention is that... By the way, that's the road that the Spanish company is going to put a toll road on, too, right?
[02:23:00.663 --> 02:23:01.063]  Oh, yeah.
[02:23:01.083 --> 02:23:04.704]  Because I saw that with Sentra grabbing a bunch of roads in Indiana.
[02:23:06.224 --> 02:23:06.364]  Yeah.
[02:23:06.424 --> 02:23:06.725]  Go ahead.
[02:23:06.765 --> 02:23:08.065]  We have their proposed maps.
[02:23:08.105 --> 02:23:11.986]  We know everybody's land it's going through, and it's just cutting farmland to pieces.
[02:23:12.066 --> 02:23:12.526]  It's horrible.
[02:23:13.726 --> 02:23:18.927]  But on the global population, I don't know why these people are so worried about how many people are on the planet.
[02:23:18.987 --> 02:23:19.747]  I did the math.
[02:23:20.127 --> 02:23:22.368]  If you take the square footage of Florida...
[02:23:22.725 --> 02:23:27.587]  You could put all 7 billion people on the planet in Florida with 20 square foot each.
[02:23:28.147 --> 02:23:30.929]  That's just to give you an idea about how big this plant really is.
[02:23:31.529 --> 02:23:32.589]  Yeah, your phone's going out.
[02:23:32.629 --> 02:23:33.990]  I'm going to have to let you go in a second.
[02:23:34.010 --> 02:23:34.250]  Finish up.
[02:23:34.350 --> 02:23:35.571]  All right, one more thing.
[02:23:35.611 --> 02:23:36.431]  I'll get closer to it.
[02:23:37.232 --> 02:23:38.632]  I didn't realize this, Alex.
[02:23:38.692 --> 02:23:44.675]  I've been looking at the 911 quite a bit, but did you know that they had them install GPS...
[02:23:45.211 --> 02:23:46.992]  Into those trucks hauling that steel.
[02:23:47.172 --> 02:23:49.393]  I mean, why would they worry about where a truck was going?
[02:23:49.573 --> 02:23:56.775]  Oh, no, they put GPS on each big piece of steel, and one guy stopped for a sub sandwich for 15 minutes and was fired.
[02:23:56.795 --> 02:24:00.437]  I appreciate your call, because they blew it, plain and simple.
[02:24:00.477 --> 02:24:05.279]  The mathematics, the science, the eyewitnesses, everything proves they blew those buildings.
[02:24:05.319 --> 02:24:11.401]  And then Silver King slipped up and said he blew it up, and then we're supposed to forget he did that on national television.
[02:24:12.381 --> 02:24:13.241]  But you're absolutely right.
[02:24:13.281 --> 02:24:14.982]  Good to have your call.
[02:24:15.962 --> 02:24:18.003]  Let's go ahead and talk to Rick and Reno.
[02:24:18.023 --> 02:24:18.723]  I'm going quick now.
[02:24:18.763 --> 02:24:19.224]  Go ahead, Rick.
[02:24:19.824 --> 02:24:26.906]  I'm calling to point out a profoundly nonsensical point which the Patriot Movement puts forth.
[02:24:27.206 --> 02:24:35.529]  That is that the Iranians will not have a nuclear weapon for 10 years, as though that's doing the Iranians and the world a favor.
[02:24:35.810 --> 02:24:36.930]  Can you explain that to me?
[02:24:38.725 --> 02:24:40.567]  Sir, why don't you elaborate?
[02:24:40.587 --> 02:24:50.196]  Are you saying that you think they're allowed to have a weapon, and so why are we even having this discussion?
[02:24:50.216 --> 02:24:51.517]  So why do they have a weapon?
[02:24:51.917 --> 02:25:01.546]  I'm saying the argument the neocons use, they're not allowed to have one because it's global government, and they're going to attack them because they've secretly got one, they're going to have one in three months.
[02:25:01.766 --> 02:25:02.887]  My point is that the logic leads to, alright well,
[02:25:24.059 --> 02:25:29.183]  Then we'll wait for ten years until they test a weapon and then pounce on them and level them.
[02:25:29.583 --> 02:25:31.565]  No, no, I think that's wrong, too.
[02:25:31.605 --> 02:25:33.106]  Listen, I think that's wrong, too, sir.
[02:25:33.186 --> 02:25:36.829]  I'm just showing that their claim of, They've got the weapon!
[02:25:36.869 --> 02:25:38.730]  We've got to hit them right now!
[02:25:38.971 --> 02:25:42.593]  And, you know, this push to war and beating the drum is a fraud.
[02:25:42.954 --> 02:25:51.000]  Well, in my estimation, you don't let a war criminal, George Walker Bush, attack...
[02:25:52.492 --> 02:25:54.953]  North Korea for detonating a nuclear weapon.
[02:25:55.393 --> 02:26:12.042]  And thank goodness for China and Russia as a counterbalance to the rabid, amphetamine-shot-up dog, the United States, and George Bush, George Walker Bush, who is nothing but a logical outcome of the demise of the Soviet Union.
[02:26:12.802 --> 02:26:14.423]  Listen, I appreciate your call, sir.
[02:26:15.203 --> 02:26:17.124]  Respectfully, I disagree with some of what you said.
[02:26:18.405 --> 02:26:20.146]  The New World Order controls Russia.
[02:26:20.366 --> 02:26:22.007]  The New World Order controls China.
[02:26:22.848 --> 02:26:25.310]  They may not control North Korea.
[02:26:26.210 --> 02:26:32.275]  He admittedly apologized last year for kidnapping women and raping and killing them.
[02:26:32.935 --> 02:26:34.756]  I mean, you cannot make this type of stuff up.
[02:26:34.836 --> 02:26:47.345]  Imagine, again, a Hollywood movie where there's a weird third world dictatorship or second world Stalinist regime where there's a guy that lives in an armored compound on the side of a mountain
[02:26:48.423 --> 02:26:55.752]  And he has his special forces go hijack planes that a particular South Korean star is on because he wants her.
[02:26:56.973 --> 02:27:00.057]  I mean the guy is a complete piece of trash.
[02:27:00.958 --> 02:27:02.640]  He is totally on a power trip.
[02:27:03.201 --> 02:27:05.844]  He is just as evil as the people running our government.
[02:27:06.477 --> 02:27:07.358]  That's the New World Order.
[02:27:07.378 --> 02:27:11.140]  They're a bunch of inbred, spoiled brats who are so bored.
[02:27:11.540 --> 02:27:13.341]  I saw pictures of them in his car yesterday.
[02:27:13.621 --> 02:27:18.044]  Kim Jong-il was all on a power trip, a little power trip face he had on.
[02:27:19.004 --> 02:27:20.145]  It's a power trip!
[02:27:20.966 --> 02:27:21.746]  They're so bored.
[02:27:21.766 --> 02:27:22.306]  They love it.
[02:27:22.326 --> 02:27:24.588]  They love pushing us towards World War III.
[02:27:25.648 --> 02:27:28.550]  So, oh my gosh.
[02:27:28.610 --> 02:27:29.230]  We'll come back.
[02:27:30.151 --> 02:27:30.811]  Cover some news.
[02:27:30.831 --> 02:27:31.632]  Go back to your calls.
[02:27:33.835 --> 02:27:34.716]  We're on the march.
[02:27:35.217 --> 02:27:36.799]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:36.819 --> 02:27:40.425]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:45.768 --> 02:27:46.148]  We're good to go.
[02:28:06.834 --> 02:28:07.635]  We're good to go.
[02:28:29.497 --> 02:28:29.637]  1-866-885-6625 1-866-885-6625
[02:28:44.068 --> 02:28:44.728]  Hello, folks.

[02:29:44.150 --> 02:29:46.472]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here with an important question.
[02:29:46.732 --> 02:29:48.774]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[02:29:48.914 --> 02:29:55.979]  I mean real hard to find all natural pure soap that contains no dyes, perfumes, deodorants, detergents, or other dangerous toxins.
[02:29:56.239 --> 02:30:04.786]  The Calvin Pure Soap Company, for the past 57 years, has been making triple concentrated pure soaps exclusively for healthcare professionals and hospitals.
[02:30:05.146 --> 02:30:09.831]  Now for the first time, Calvin Pure Soap is available factory direct to you and your family.

[02:30:30.768 --> 02:30:31.708]  That's 1-800-340-7091 or on the web at calbinpuresoap.com.
[02:30:31.748 --> 02:30:34.309]  Try pure soap once and I'll guarantee you'll never use anything else.
[02:30:53.744 --> 02:30:56.265]  All right, your phone calls are coming up at 1-800-259-9231.
[02:30:56.285 --> 02:31:13.069]  Wayne Madsen report, who did break the story about this other Republican congressman who told Foley to stop his philandering and his perverted behavior as well, many different levels of his activity.
[02:31:14.069 --> 02:31:14.789]  He did report on that.
[02:31:14.829 --> 02:31:15.969]  He's broken a lot of other stories.
[02:31:16.009 --> 02:31:22.791]  He's reporting that Ennis Astrid is a homosexual who hires male prostitutes, and that he lives with one of his senior staffers.
[02:31:23.624 --> 02:31:28.330]  It's a big joke in Washington, so Hastert is basically being leveraged as well.
[02:31:28.350 --> 02:31:29.291]  And, of course, you know that.
[02:31:29.331 --> 02:31:38.722]  I mean, Speaker of the House, the former male wrestling team coach, he is definitely in a lot of trouble.
[02:31:39.322 --> 02:31:43.167]  And this thing is getting bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger.
[02:31:43.979 --> 02:31:49.602]  And more and more serious than all the articles on this subject up on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:31:49.902 --> 02:31:53.504]  On North Korea, they really are escalating things about the test day.
[02:31:54.625 --> 02:31:56.626]  Another nuclear thing.
[02:31:56.666 --> 02:32:02.890]  And the question is, why did Bill Clinton, George Bush, Donald Rumsfeld help arm North Korea?
[02:32:02.950 --> 02:32:04.691]  Because it's the best enemy money can buy.
[02:32:05.051 --> 02:32:10.834]  There will now be an arms race where they can sell weapons to the Chinese, to the Taiwanese, to the Japanese.
[02:32:10.874 --> 02:32:12.215]  The Japanese are now breaking weapons.
[02:32:13.325 --> 02:32:16.447]  They're non-militarism constitution and militarizing.
[02:32:17.067 --> 02:32:18.328]  It's just good for business.
[02:32:19.989 --> 02:32:25.712]  And just like an endless Iraq war broken in three parts is going to be good for business, and that's now admitted in the Times of London.
[02:32:26.312 --> 02:32:29.994]  That's been the plan, that is the plan, and that's now what they're doing.
[02:32:30.034 --> 02:32:37.678]  So whenever a neocon, you're talking to one of these little minions, these little people that are so brain-dead, they think they're conservative and they're not,
[02:32:39.079 --> 02:32:46.182]  Make sure that you go, number one, you notice North Korea did this and has threatened to nuke us and fired a dummy missile at us.
[02:32:46.202 --> 02:32:49.003]  That's an important point no one seems to ever realize.
[02:32:50.443 --> 02:32:55.845]  And not only are they threatening to nuke us, but I guess you still think we should attack Iran, right?
[02:32:56.305 --> 02:33:01.967]  And then go ahead and point out to them, but don't hold your breath, that our government helped arm North Korea and Pakistan.
[02:33:02.847 --> 02:33:07.269]  And you'll be blue in the face by then and you'll realize that these people do not care.
[02:33:08.724 --> 02:33:20.953]  George Bush could announce we need to attack Antarctica and claim that there's a new species of vampiric penguin known to be fornicating with Martian elves.
[02:33:21.614 --> 02:33:30.140]  And there would be a huge call, and the shooting ranges would start handing out pictures of fanged penguins, and it would be maybe wearing turbans.
[02:33:30.821 --> 02:33:34.784]  And then the call to attack Antarctica would then be launched.
[02:33:35.888 --> 02:33:37.089]  And by the way, I'm not joking.
[02:33:37.149 --> 02:33:42.452]  I'm convinced that you could claim that blood-drinking penguins were at the South Pole and that the attack needed to be launched.
[02:33:42.492 --> 02:33:46.435]  And some of these people would gung-holy couldn't find Antarctica on a map.
[02:33:47.055 --> 02:33:48.316]  They wouldn't know what the poles were.
[02:33:48.436 --> 02:33:49.557]  They'd hit them upside the head.
[02:33:49.577 --> 02:33:53.099]  All right, maybe I am joking a bit with that.
[02:33:53.159 --> 02:33:56.241]  But you get my point, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:33:58.162 --> 02:33:59.243]  Oh, my goodness.
[02:34:01.229 --> 02:34:06.874]  Also, China is denouncing the brazen North Korean nuclear test because nuclear testing has been banned.
[02:34:06.914 --> 02:34:18.844]  It's been proven to get into the atmosphere even if it's underground and does cause seismic problems and does cause a worldwide nuclear arms race to go ahead and kick off once again.
[02:34:19.204 --> 02:34:20.385]  But who's worried about that?
[02:34:20.965 --> 02:34:26.510]  The Air Force admits they're doing antimatter bomb tests and they admit the top scientists and scientists
[02:34:27.205 --> 02:34:35.008]  And folks that understand the mechanics of the subatomic are telling him that it could cause a chain reaction destroying not just the planet, but the solar system.
[02:34:35.068 --> 02:34:37.689]  It could actually cause a black hole to form.
[02:34:38.209 --> 02:34:39.390]  Does the Air Force care?
[02:34:39.490 --> 02:34:47.153]  No, they're going ahead with superconducting supercolliders, capturing and then testing and then detonating antimatter.
[02:34:48.474 --> 02:34:54.996]  So you won't even feel anything if this reaction does take place at the level that a lot of top scientists believe it could.
[02:34:55.376 --> 02:34:56.737]  You just will all be gone.
[02:34:57.543 --> 02:35:09.430]  I guess there's some solace that everything in the world and everything on it... Or it could just blow up with the power of a 500 million megaton A-bomb, hydrogen bomb.
[02:35:10.770 --> 02:35:13.152]  It could just blow the planet into an asteroid belt.
[02:35:13.192 --> 02:35:14.973]  It could be a small detonation.
[02:35:16.661 --> 02:35:31.680]  By the way, that was in major papers, like the San Francisco Chronicle, and then the Air Force retroactively classified it and said the Air Force colonel that gave the speech that was attended by the press had accidentally read from classified material.
[02:35:32.549 --> 02:35:49.277]  Kind of like they did in, what, the mid-80s, when they admitted they have robot-attacked space planes, robotically controlled, from the ground, with gravity well weapons that drop depleted uranium bombs that have the equivalent of a nuclear blast when they hit the ground.
[02:35:50.838 --> 02:35:51.438]  They swept up.
[02:35:52.779 --> 02:35:53.279]  Quite a bit.
[02:35:55.760 --> 02:35:58.001]  George Bush has got to be on quite a power trip.
[02:35:58.382 --> 02:36:01.083]  Got all those little space planes flying around with their
[02:36:01.764 --> 02:36:08.590]  They're AI pilots controlled by the ground, ready to decapitate every major world leader in just a few minutes.
[02:36:09.751 --> 02:36:11.053]  If you can find where they're sleeping.
[02:36:13.095 --> 02:36:15.777]  Yes, they've got to be on quite a power trip right now.
[02:36:15.997 --> 02:36:19.220]  So what if North Korea nukes Alaska or hits California?
[02:36:19.500 --> 02:36:25.906]  They can hit as far towards the central area as Illinois.
[02:36:25.926 --> 02:36:27.568]  You can see they can shoot over the poles.
[02:36:28.965 --> 02:36:30.206]  Alaska's easy for them.
[02:36:30.226 --> 02:36:30.666]  That was in 2000.
[02:36:31.227 --> 02:36:32.928]  Now they can hit Illinois.
[02:36:33.289 --> 02:36:35.731]  Analysts have looked at their missiles and concluded that.
[02:36:36.351 --> 02:36:37.792]  They can hit Illinois.
[02:36:38.133 --> 02:36:40.154]  They can hit New York.
[02:36:40.214 --> 02:36:41.615]  They can hit Seattle.
[02:36:42.056 --> 02:36:44.037]  They can hit Northern California.
[02:36:44.638 --> 02:36:47.540]  And they're threatening to do a show and have the missiles, and have already fired one at us.
[02:36:47.580 --> 02:36:49.562]  But, again, I shouldn't repeat that again.
[02:36:49.602 --> 02:36:50.503]  It's not newsworthy.
[02:36:50.783 --> 02:36:53.605]  Let's talk about Iran and Ahmadinejad for a few hours.
[02:36:54.026 --> 02:36:56.848]  Let's not talk about Pakistan with dozens of weapons and missiles.
[02:36:57.685 --> 02:37:05.893]  Let's not talk about how our government totally controls them and is using them to stage terror attacks and kill their own CIA agents when they find out that al-Qaeda is al-CIAIDA.
[02:37:06.393 --> 02:37:12.279]  Let's not talk about all the fake videos they released, like the one they released two weeks ago, the fake hijackers, now admitted to be fake.
[02:37:12.499 --> 02:37:14.020]  Let's just believe our government!
[02:37:14.681 --> 02:37:16.162]  A bunch of child molesters!
[02:37:19.866 --> 02:37:20.687]  Here's the other news.
[02:37:21.813 --> 02:37:25.859]  Gore and Murdoch join forces in TV deal, Financial Times of London.
[02:37:26.299 --> 02:37:27.381]  Al Gore, the former U.S.
[02:37:27.961 --> 02:37:37.534]  Vice President, is bringing his user-generated content television channel to the U.K., courtesy of James Murdoch's British Sky Broadcasting.
[02:37:38.112 --> 02:37:40.233]  Mr. Gore launched Current TV, the U.S.
[02:37:40.273 --> 02:37:44.896]  channel made of clips, created by viewers and producers in August last year.
[02:37:44.916 --> 02:37:46.076]  That is a great idea.
[02:37:46.096 --> 02:37:47.497]  That's where the whole future is going.
[02:37:47.877 --> 02:37:55.601]  I've said for years we ought to go get a TV channel, a Patriot TV channel, if we had the money, and just have viewers submitted content material.
[02:37:55.621 --> 02:37:57.162]  It would be awesome in news reports.
[02:37:58.362 --> 02:38:04.205]  In August last year, it said that the channel was democratizing television, but that's not really true.
[02:38:04.406 --> 02:38:07.107]  They used their selected fake liberal stuff.
[02:38:08.320 --> 02:38:12.743]  It's going to be the fake liberal revolution to counter the evil Bush revolution.
[02:38:13.063 --> 02:38:13.523]  Controlled.
[02:38:13.743 --> 02:38:30.893]  That's why Murdoch's having weekly meetings with Hillary, Roger Ailes, Limbaugh's boss, having weekly meetings with Hillary, huge four-hour meetings, having secret campaign fundraisers run by Murdoch, Bill Clinton vacationing with the Bushes, them calling him a son, a surrogate son.
[02:38:31.353 --> 02:38:32.453]  It's all staged.
[02:38:32.834 --> 02:38:36.796]  And that brings me to the next little tidbit here.
[02:38:38.490 --> 02:38:42.513]  Kerry's barnstorming sparks talk of run.
[02:38:46.216 --> 02:38:49.058]  And it says yesterday, Senator John F. Kerry was in Iowa.
[02:38:49.098 --> 02:38:50.959]  Tomorrow, Wednesday, he'll be in Nevada.
[02:38:50.999 --> 02:38:52.140]  On Friday, he'll be in New Hampshire.
[02:38:52.160 --> 02:38:57.684]  After that, he'll visit 11 more states, including South Carolina, before the November 7th election, the midterm.
[02:38:58.630 --> 02:39:01.631]  And his friends and close associates and loyalists say they've talked to him.
[02:39:02.111 --> 02:39:03.771]  This is the Boston Globe.
[02:39:04.151 --> 02:39:06.591]  And they're saying he's planning on running for president again.
[02:39:06.631 --> 02:39:10.152]  You see, you don't just steal the election with the machines.
[02:39:10.692 --> 02:39:15.033]  Then you've got to have a candidate, if it's at a national level, who will take a dive.
[02:39:15.453 --> 02:39:21.234]  Again, the fight isn't just fixed by having the machines in place.
[02:39:21.254 --> 02:39:27.195]  You've then got to have somebody who won't point it out, like a real candidate did in Mexico when they got cheated.
[02:39:27.927 --> 02:39:32.490]  And so Bush is a cousin on nine different sides, nine different ways.
[02:39:32.510 --> 02:39:34.551]  I mean, it's like a breed of dog.
[02:39:34.611 --> 02:39:39.554]  It's like, say you have a bull mastiff, and it's related to all the other bull mastiffs.
[02:39:39.614 --> 02:39:44.797]  I mean, literally everybody's related to everybody with this sick crew of criminals.
[02:39:45.991 --> 02:39:55.214]  At that level of bluebloods, they're on the East Coast, who then have their little pedophile army that works for them all compromised, so they can just punch a button and destroy them publicly.
[02:39:55.234 --> 02:39:59.756]  And if they don't sit there and take it, they die of a heart attack or in a plane crash or a burglar shoots them.
[02:40:00.796 --> 02:40:09.619]  But Kerry, Bush's cousin, Bush's skull and bones minion, his secret society mate, it'll be the same thing.
[02:40:09.659 --> 02:40:12.340]  He'll run against whatever new neocon it is, and it won't matter.
[02:40:13.300 --> 02:40:18.182]  By the way, you think the Democrats are going to win because there's this firestorm against Bush?
[02:40:19.263 --> 02:40:21.824]  Cheney has said, I guarantee Republicans will win.
[02:40:22.404 --> 02:40:24.645]  It's like Bush said in the last presidential election.
[02:40:25.005 --> 02:40:25.866]  And believe me, they know.
[02:40:26.026 --> 02:40:29.547]  They're confident.
[02:40:29.567 --> 02:40:31.568]  35% of the country, and that was six months ago.
[02:40:31.588 --> 02:40:32.769]  I need to go look it up.
[02:40:32.829 --> 02:40:36.370]  But 35% of the country has put in the Help America Vote Act.
[02:40:36.851 --> 02:40:41.853]  And the feds only fund you if you put in Hardin or Civic, Sequoia, Diebold.
[02:40:43.107 --> 02:40:47.171]  ES&S, which are all just designed to scam.
[02:40:48.052 --> 02:40:54.138]  On the record, in triplicate, engineers going public, insiders going public, before they always die or get sued.
[02:40:54.918 --> 02:40:57.281]  And it's just all there.
[02:40:57.501 --> 02:40:59.282]  People say, well, we'd find out if that happened.
[02:40:59.303 --> 02:41:00.283]  People go public.
[02:41:00.604 --> 02:41:01.685]  They do go public.
[02:41:02.706 --> 02:41:04.768]  They go testifying in front of legislatures.
[02:41:05.949 --> 02:41:06.149]  Sorry.
[02:41:08.416 --> 02:41:11.617]  Now, again, folks, they're going for broke.
[02:41:11.637 --> 02:41:12.157]  You understand?
[02:41:12.177 --> 02:41:13.777]  They've gone past the point of no return.
[02:41:13.998 --> 02:41:14.938]  They're going for broke.
[02:41:15.098 --> 02:41:15.918]  They're not going to stop.
[02:41:16.278 --> 02:41:32.042]  Are you going to just roll over and say, whatever they do to me, I'm just going to let them, and I'm just going to go to my gym and go to my movies and drink my beer and get my nails done or strut around and act tough with a football shirt on?
[02:41:32.583 --> 02:41:33.883]  The women are all preening.
[02:41:33.923 --> 02:41:37.744]  The men are all busy strutting around, bugging their eyes out, acting manly.
[02:41:38.544 --> 02:41:40.404]  Meanwhile, a cop pulls him over there.
[02:41:40.804 --> 02:41:41.245]  Yes, sir.
[02:41:41.305 --> 02:41:42.945]  What do I need to do for you, sir?
[02:41:43.885 --> 02:41:45.265]  Bunch of cowardly scum.
[02:41:47.886 --> 02:41:48.186]  Okay.
[02:41:49.106 --> 02:41:50.546]  I'm being very friendly today, aren't I?
[02:41:50.706 --> 02:41:52.667]  Where's that next report I was going to get to?
[02:41:55.948 --> 02:41:56.828]  Where is my story?
[02:41:58.028 --> 02:42:01.509]  I had a report by the Special Forces.
[02:42:01.569 --> 02:42:08.190]  British Special Forces have gone public and are saying that Iran's not bringing any weapons in
[02:42:08.766 --> 02:42:14.589]  And they've been there, and there's no evidence of that going on.
[02:42:15.990 --> 02:42:16.390]  Here it is.
[02:42:16.450 --> 02:42:17.271]  I finally found it.
[02:42:18.432 --> 02:42:21.754]  British see no evidence of arms traffic from Iran.
[02:42:21.774 --> 02:42:23.074]  This is the Washington Post.
[02:42:25.496 --> 02:42:28.678]  But Fox News tells you Foley's a Democrat, so it must be true.
[02:42:29.218 --> 02:42:32.360]  British see no evidence of arms traffic from Iran.
[02:42:33.300 --> 02:42:34.421]  British commandos...
[02:42:36.477 --> 02:42:40.499]  Combing border with Iran, finding no weapons being smuggled into Iraq.
[02:42:41.999 --> 02:42:50.723]  Since late August, British commandos in the desert of far southeastern Iraq, and I always say western Iraq.
[02:42:51.823 --> 02:42:56.025]  Obviously, western Iraq borders Jordan and Saudi Arabia.
[02:42:58.806 --> 02:43:00.407]  I mean western Iran.
[02:43:00.827 --> 02:43:01.727]  I get turned around.
[02:43:01.807 --> 02:43:05.509]  No one's emailed me pointing that out, but I realize my mistakes by the minute.
[02:43:06.141 --> 02:43:09.702]  There are always little stupid things like that, because it would be Eastern Iraq, Western Iran.
[02:43:11.443 --> 02:43:26.828]  Since late August, British commandos in the desert of far Southeastern Iraq have been testing one of the most serious challenges leveled by the United States against Iran, that Iran is secretly supplying weapons, parts, money, and training for attacks on U.S.-led forces in Iraq.
[02:43:28.428 --> 02:43:40.997]  A few hundred British troops living out of their Land Rovers and light armored vehicles have taken to the desert in what their officers said would be months of patrols aimed at finding any illicit weapons trafficking from Iran.
[02:43:41.497 --> 02:43:42.558]  There's just one thing.
[02:43:43.339 --> 02:43:45.600]  I suspect there's nothing out there, said the commander.
[02:43:46.721 --> 02:43:51.905]  Lieutenant Colonel David Laborshire said last month, and I intend to prove it.
[02:43:52.719 --> 02:43:54.840]  Britain has found nothing to support the U.S.
[02:43:54.860 --> 02:43:58.361]  contention that Iran is providing weapons and training in Iraq.
[02:43:58.661 --> 02:44:08.404]  Several senior military officials said, I have not myself seen any evidence, and I don't think any evidence exists of government support or that it's been instigated.
[02:44:08.804 --> 02:44:13.185]  Now, Iran openly announced they were sending in fighters to fight Israel in Lebanon.
[02:44:13.866 --> 02:44:15.186]  Because Lebanon asked for the help.
[02:44:15.566 --> 02:44:16.787]  Hezbollah asked for the help.
[02:44:17.967 --> 02:44:18.867]  And it happened.
[02:44:19.247 --> 02:44:21.248]  But they said they are not doing anything in Iraq.
[02:44:23.032 --> 02:44:26.994]  It's a question of intelligence versus evidence, the colonel said.
[02:44:27.014 --> 02:44:38.661]  And it goes on to say that Brigadier General James Everett of Britain's 20th Armored Brigade said last month, one hears word of mouth, but one has to see it with one's own eyes.
[02:44:39.281 --> 02:44:44.004]  As if all the drones and helicopters wouldn't pick up arms coming across that frontier.
[02:44:44.824 --> 02:44:51.148]  Allegation that Iran or its agents are providing military support for Iraq, Shiite, Muslim militants and other armed groups.
[02:44:51.861 --> 02:44:55.103]  ...are among the issues raised tensions between Washington and Tehran.
[02:44:55.463 --> 02:44:56.443]  Most gravely, U.S.
[02:44:56.483 --> 02:45:03.706]  officials accuse Iran of providing infrared triggers for special explosives that are capable of piercing heavy armor.
[02:45:04.267 --> 02:45:06.428]  And where do those triggers have been proved to come from?
[02:45:07.068 --> 02:45:07.668]  New York!
[02:45:08.649 --> 02:45:12.090]  We've had British former special forces on to tell you about that.
[02:45:12.610 --> 02:45:17.313]  These are U.S.-made triggers, and of course they're coming from the terrorists.
[02:45:17.833 --> 02:45:18.313]  Our government.
[02:45:20.663 --> 02:45:28.786]  British, Israeli, and US troops have all been caught shooting our troops, bombing and killing, and shooting Iraqi police.
[02:45:31.368 --> 02:45:37.150]  Our Marines have been shot at, and they go and catch them and beat them up and pull the beards off, and it's Israelis.
[02:45:39.331 --> 02:45:41.072]  Also, British troops have been caught.
[02:45:41.852 --> 02:45:43.433]  And you go, how is that possible?
[02:45:44.373 --> 02:45:45.934]  That's Dirty Tricks 101.
[02:45:48.335 --> 02:45:49.015]  Dirty Tricks 101.
[02:45:50.667 --> 02:45:55.370]  101.
[02:45:50.707 --> 02:45:55.370]  And again, we're a bunch of naive chicken necks who are never going to figure that out, so we're going to be enslaved.
[02:45:56.470 --> 02:45:59.272]  Let's go ahead and go to some of your calls.
[02:46:00.372 --> 02:46:04.294]  Up next, we will talk to Kevin in Denver.
[02:46:04.334 --> 02:46:04.894]  Go ahead, Kevin.
[02:46:05.715 --> 02:46:07.836]  Alex, we're not rolling over in Colorado.
[02:46:08.356 --> 02:46:11.818]  By the end of this month, we'll have something that YouTube can't delete.
[02:46:12.458 --> 02:46:16.780]  That is that Stephen Jones will be speaking at DU, Denver University University.
[02:46:17.376 --> 02:46:21.139]  And University of Colorado, the last weekend of October.
[02:46:21.780 --> 02:46:22.440]  Well, good.
[02:46:22.640 --> 02:46:22.881]  Good.
[02:46:22.901 --> 02:46:23.601]  That's excellent.
[02:46:24.222 --> 02:46:25.102]  Very exciting.
[02:46:25.423 --> 02:46:30.046]  Not only Stephen Jones, but also Kevin Ryan and Professor Kevin Barrett.
[02:46:31.347 --> 02:46:35.831]  This will be October 28th and 29th from 2 to 6 both days.
[02:46:36.612 --> 02:46:38.373]  Davis Auditorium at DU.
[02:46:39.314 --> 02:46:41.956]  Math Auditorium at University of Colorado on Sunday.
[02:46:42.717 --> 02:46:43.137]  Well, good.
[02:46:43.157 --> 02:46:47.498]  I'm sure you can check all the 9-11 sites and they'll have all the dates and the details.
[02:46:49.038 --> 02:46:56.059]  Very excited to have this happening and thank you for keeping these gentlemen in the public eye.
[02:46:56.079 --> 02:46:57.660]  Well, thank you, sir.
[02:46:57.700 --> 02:47:01.780]  What do you think about what's happening with the nuke test over in North Korea?
[02:47:03.941 --> 02:47:05.321]  You know, it doesn't seem right.
[02:47:05.361 --> 02:47:06.581]  It doesn't seem like it's real to me.
[02:47:06.601 --> 02:47:06.761]  I just...
[02:47:13.567 --> 02:47:15.067]  It seems like it's a diversion.
[02:47:15.488 --> 02:47:18.168]  My gut tells me that Kim Jong-il is on the payroll.
[02:47:18.208 --> 02:47:19.448]  We know China is.
[02:47:19.948 --> 02:47:22.029]  We know Iran has been in the past.
[02:47:22.549 --> 02:47:28.690]  We know our government blocked the FBI and CIA from stopping AQ Khan Laboratories.
[02:47:28.730 --> 02:47:30.751]  We know Rumsfeld, who literally is like the devil.
[02:47:30.771 --> 02:47:33.331]  He shows up every time something wicked is happening.
[02:47:33.371 --> 02:47:34.031]  He opens the door.
[02:47:34.051 --> 02:47:35.432]  Oh, there's Rumsfeld, of course.
[02:47:36.092 --> 02:47:37.292]  As I said last week.
[02:47:38.492 --> 02:47:40.052]  Rumsfeld gave them the reactors.
[02:47:40.813 --> 02:47:42.653]  Is this some backroom deal that
[02:47:43.331 --> 02:47:46.713]  You know, threaten Japan so we can sell them weapons.
[02:47:46.893 --> 02:47:47.934]  Threaten everybody.
[02:47:47.974 --> 02:47:48.974]  Shoot a missile at us.
[02:47:49.635 --> 02:47:51.016]  But then I look at Kim Jong-il.
[02:47:51.056 --> 02:47:52.136]  That guy's a loose cannon.
[02:47:52.617 --> 02:47:53.577]  I just don't know anymore.
[02:47:53.817 --> 02:47:55.518]  That's the problem when it's so corrupt.
[02:47:56.379 --> 02:47:58.640]  Anything to keep the attention off the real threat.
[02:47:59.521 --> 02:48:01.982]  Yeah, but do you think the Foley thing's a distraction?
[02:48:02.002 --> 02:48:03.863]  I think somebody's using it for blackmail.
[02:48:03.883 --> 02:48:04.944]  I don't think it's the White House.
[02:48:05.404 --> 02:48:12.829]  And I think it's getting out of control now and really puts the neocons' backs up against the wall because of their taste for men and boys.
[02:48:13.669 --> 02:48:20.695]  Well, I used to say that Monica Lewinsky was the best thing that ever happened to Bill Clinton because she took the attention off the other things.
[02:48:21.656 --> 02:48:22.456]  Well, she was.
[02:48:22.677 --> 02:48:23.657]  She was, yeah.
[02:48:24.018 --> 02:48:30.283]  Off the missile secrets, off the communist generals, off killing Ron Brown and the cocaine dealers and the rest of it.
[02:48:30.303 --> 02:48:30.823]  Yeah, you're right.
[02:48:31.444 --> 02:48:34.226]  Yeah, it's just, they know what to feed the public.
[02:48:35.147 --> 02:48:38.330]  But I don't know, I see just a cauldron of things happening right now.
[02:48:39.371 --> 02:48:41.552]  We'll be right back, take some final calls and wrap it up.
[02:48:41.592 --> 02:48:42.073]  Stay the course.
[02:48:46.898 --> 02:48:50.100]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[02:48:50.440 --> 02:48:52.361]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[02:48:52.762 --> 02:49:00.426]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:49:01.087 --> 02:49:08.131]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:49:08.551 --> 02:49:11.493]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran.
[02:49:11.873 --> 02:49:14.174]  A White House program to disseminate fake news.
[02:49:14.615 --> 02:49:15.435]  NSA spies.
[02:49:15.928 --> 02:49:16.628]  Or by calling toll-free 1-888-253-3139.

[02:50:04.804 --> 02:50:05.765]  We're good to go.
[02:50:32.043 --> 02:50:36.031]  By calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[02:50:43.547 --> 02:50:51.489]  For years, you've been hearing about Herbal Healer Academy and how it's remained a leader in effective alternative and natural medicine and education.
[02:50:51.929 --> 02:50:55.090]  But how can they continue to hold that title for years on end?
[02:50:55.470 --> 02:50:58.530]  The answer is high quality and huge selection.

[02:51:07.245 --> 02:51:11.927]  Did you know that Herbal Healer carries the latest, safest and effective weight loss products?
[02:51:12.447 --> 02:51:18.289]  You can also count on Herbal Healer for the largest selection of safe and natural supplements just for children.

[02:51:20.250 --> 02:51:25.892]  Herbal Healer even has natural mineral supplements for all your animals, including horses, cows and birds.
[02:51:26.383 --> 02:51:26.944]  We're good to go.
[02:51:46.840 --> 02:51:47.300]  Don't worry.
[02:51:47.821 --> 02:51:49.321]  This show is documented.
[02:51:49.862 --> 02:51:52.603]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:51:53.384 --> 02:51:53.944]  That's right.
[02:51:53.964 --> 02:51:55.105]  The truth is documented.
[02:51:55.165 --> 02:51:56.245]  It stands on its own.
[02:51:56.265 --> 02:51:57.806]  The criminals will be brought to justice.
[02:51:57.946 --> 02:52:01.208]  I want to talk to Art Clay and Dee briefly here at the end of the transmission.
[02:52:02.193 --> 02:52:06.336]  But just a program note, I'm doing a new syndicated Sunday show, 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:52:06.756 --> 02:52:13.702]  Central, and it's on the big Star Guide feed, and we have that listed at GCNlive.com for stations.
[02:52:14.162 --> 02:52:18.665]  But all of our existing affiliates, please try to pick it up or re-air it later Sunday night.
[02:52:18.765 --> 02:52:19.806]  It's a really great show.
[02:52:20.307 --> 02:52:24.450]  And please contact Affiliate Relations at Genesis, and that's at 877-996-4327, extension 101.
[02:52:30.408 --> 02:52:37.658]  Because we want to get those affiliate relations agreements signed quickly and get you on board this coming Sunday, the official maiden voyage.
[02:52:37.898 --> 02:52:40.081]  We've had two weeks of testing and sent it out live.
[02:52:40.722 --> 02:52:45.629]  Yesterday it was a great broadcast out of the offices, the studios of KLBJ 590.
[02:52:46.010 --> 02:52:46.791]  We're really excited.
[02:52:47.714 --> 02:52:51.697]  And in closing, for the plug here, please get Terror Storm.
[02:52:51.737 --> 02:52:52.437]  I'm proud of it.
[02:52:52.718 --> 02:52:54.239]  It's a film that needs to be seen.
[02:52:54.299 --> 02:52:56.540]  It proves 9-11 is an inside job.
[02:52:56.580 --> 02:53:02.644]  It proves 7-7, the Madrid bombing, the Iraq war is staged, the torture, the surveillance, the criminality.
[02:53:03.145 --> 02:53:04.325]  Get Terror Storm today.
[02:53:04.406 --> 02:53:05.326]  Get it, make copies.
[02:53:05.366 --> 02:53:08.728]  Available at Infowars.com or by calling toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[02:53:08.769 --> 02:53:10.670]  Let's talk to Art in Kansas.
[02:53:10.690 --> 02:53:11.210]  Art, go ahead.
[02:53:16.992 --> 02:53:17.532]  All right, Art.
[02:53:17.572 --> 02:53:18.172]  What's on your mind?
[02:53:18.192 --> 02:53:18.513]  Hi.
[02:53:19.233 --> 02:53:24.854]  That guy that called in before with the laundry list of George W. Walker Bush, or Herbert Walker Bush?
[02:53:25.075 --> 02:53:25.335]  Yes.
[02:53:25.615 --> 02:53:31.857]  One thing he forgot, that Bush was in charge when the Congress pushed through this Noahide Law.
[02:53:32.377 --> 02:53:33.077]  That's on the book.
[02:53:35.134 --> 02:53:36.635]  A lot of bad stuff's happened.
[02:53:36.915 --> 02:53:39.997]  Rex 84, the concentration camp plans, you name it.
[02:53:40.037 --> 02:53:41.378]  He's particularly evil.
[02:53:41.818 --> 02:53:47.201]  And I never thought anything would happen in Korea because the Bushes have had investments over there for years.
[02:53:48.402 --> 02:53:49.923]  I assume in South Korea.
[02:53:51.104 --> 02:53:51.704]  But I don't know.
[02:53:52.064 --> 02:53:52.585]  Absolutely.
[02:53:52.625 --> 02:53:53.645]  I appreciate your call, Art.
[02:53:53.905 --> 02:53:54.906]  Clay in Missouri.
[02:53:54.926 --> 02:53:55.807]  You're on the air, Clay.
[02:53:57.688 --> 02:53:58.048]  Hello?
[02:53:58.228 --> 02:53:58.548]  Yes, sir.
[02:53:58.908 --> 02:53:59.789]  Yeah, this is Clay.
[02:54:00.249 --> 02:54:00.529]  Okay.
[02:54:00.769 --> 02:54:01.030]  Okay.
[02:54:01.410 --> 02:54:01.530]  Uh...
[02:54:02.438 --> 02:54:05.159]  I'll just say this for the benefit of your audience, and maybe even you.
[02:54:05.739 --> 02:54:12.201]  You probably know this, but years ago, 15 years ago, I read an article in the Spotlight newspaper by some general.
[02:54:12.241 --> 02:54:15.202]  He made this statement, and I heard it again a few years ago.
[02:54:15.562 --> 02:54:17.222]  This fellow was a general.
[02:54:17.242 --> 02:54:18.703]  It might have been on your show.
[02:54:18.763 --> 02:54:20.183]  I don't remember whether it was.
[02:54:20.243 --> 02:54:23.224]  I know he was a former head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
[02:54:23.704 --> 02:54:25.805]  And this is almost, quote, what he said.
[02:54:25.845 --> 02:54:27.545]  He said, Make no mistake.
[02:54:28.546 --> 02:54:29.166]  One commie...
[02:54:29.790 --> 02:54:33.552]  Never saw another commie he didn't love, and you can take that to the bank.
[02:54:34.792 --> 02:54:39.294]  Are you talking about Admiral Moore?
[02:54:39.314 --> 02:54:41.395]  I don't remember who said it.
[02:54:41.695 --> 02:54:42.876]  It might have been Admiral.
[02:54:45.917 --> 02:54:47.117]  What does this pertain to?
[02:54:47.438 --> 02:54:51.659]  Basically, it pertains to all this stuff about North Korea.
[02:54:51.739 --> 02:54:53.920]  It's all a distraction, like the previous guy said.
[02:54:54.220 --> 02:54:54.921]  It's a lot of bunk.
[02:54:54.961 --> 02:54:55.401]  They have to...
[02:54:56.187 --> 02:54:59.590]  You see, they only attack countries that are non-communist.
[02:54:59.610 --> 02:55:01.893]  So the case then was, how come you don't attack communist countries?
[02:55:02.013 --> 02:55:03.714]  And I said, well, look at the things we're seeing.
[02:55:03.794 --> 02:55:04.495]  Well, it is true.
[02:55:04.535 --> 02:55:05.816]  I wouldn't even call them communists.
[02:55:05.876 --> 02:55:07.078]  They call themselves communists.
[02:55:07.098 --> 02:55:07.818]  They're globalists.
[02:55:07.838 --> 02:55:08.539]  And I agree.
[02:55:09.139 --> 02:55:12.282]  I know it's staged with Russia and China.
[02:55:12.302 --> 02:55:13.323]  That's now come out.
[02:55:13.604 --> 02:55:19.009]  In fact, and thanks for the call, the History Channel admits our government put Mao in in 1949.
[02:55:20.962 --> 02:55:23.805]  I mean, I've seen the CIA section chief laugh and admit it.
[02:55:24.185 --> 02:55:26.027]  Let's go ahead and take a call.
[02:55:26.087 --> 02:55:28.249]  Dee in Rhode Island, you are our tail gunner.
[02:55:29.010 --> 02:55:29.310]  Hi.
[02:55:29.630 --> 02:55:30.231]  Hi, Alex.
[02:55:30.311 --> 02:55:31.452]  Hello.
[02:55:32.353 --> 02:55:37.778]  I want to know what your opinion is on Glenn Beck.
[02:55:38.812 --> 02:55:40.253]  Absolutely horrible creature.
[02:55:40.574 --> 02:55:41.134]  You think so?
[02:55:41.174 --> 02:55:44.617]  Total neocon posing as a non-partisan.
[02:55:45.477 --> 02:55:47.799]  Mixing in a little bit of truth with a ton of lies.
[02:55:48.300 --> 02:55:49.540]  Oh, Al-Qaeda's got nukes.
[02:55:49.561 --> 02:55:50.721]  They're going to nuke us any minute.
[02:55:50.761 --> 02:55:51.882]  Give up all your rights.
[02:55:52.443 --> 02:55:54.384]  Yeah, Glenn Beck's a complete travesty.
[02:55:55.465 --> 02:55:55.585]  Oh.
[02:55:55.885 --> 02:55:59.828]  Well, I did hear him say, can we really trust the government?
[02:56:00.349 --> 02:56:03.491]  It sounds like he's okay, you know, in a way.
[02:56:03.511 --> 02:56:05.093]  Yeah, it's like rat poison.
[02:56:05.213 --> 02:56:06.734]  It's 98% nutritious grain.
[02:56:07.721 --> 02:56:07.861]  Oh.
[02:56:08.201 --> 02:56:09.181]  Call into Glenn Beck.
[02:56:09.201 --> 02:56:10.882]  Tell him about Infowars.com.
[02:56:10.922 --> 02:56:13.662]  Talk about 9-11 being an inside job and see what he does.
[02:56:13.722 --> 02:56:15.283]  Thanks for the call, D. Call me back tomorrow.
[02:56:15.303 --> 02:56:15.943]  We can talk more.
[02:56:16.523 --> 02:56:18.904]  All right, get out there and take on the new owner, Scum.
[02:56:19.204 --> 02:56:20.384]  God bless you all.
[02:56:23.545 --> 02:56:28.146]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-376-45.
