[00:00:05.567 --> 00:00:06.207]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.867 --> 00:00:07.928]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.648 --> 00:00:09.728]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.408 --> 00:00:11.209]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:12.889]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.331]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.711 --> 00:00:21.773]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:25.575 --> 00:00:27.676]  Welcome, my friends.
[00:00:27.736 --> 00:00:28.057]  Welcome.
[00:00:28.197 --> 00:00:30.578]  It is the 24th day of October 2006.
[00:00:30.659 --> 00:00:35.302]  We're going to be live here for you in the next three hours.
[00:00:35.382 --> 00:00:38.744]  Coming up in the second hour, we have Norm Baker.
[00:00:53.533 --> 00:01:00.257]  Member of Parliament joining us, and I'm feverishly trying to find the video and the audio of this so we can play it.
[00:01:00.337 --> 00:01:15.865]  His exchange with Tony Blair over the fact that Tony Blair has been photographed, Tony Blair has admitted in the past that he went to Bilderberg group meetings in the early 1990s and in the late 1990s as Prime Minister, which is unprecedented.
[00:01:15.905 --> 00:01:20.007]  Of course, he went in the early 1990s when he was a little-known Member of Parliament from Labour.
[00:01:21.408 --> 00:01:25.231]  And Tony Blair has been questioned about this by the House of Lords and the House of Commons.
[00:01:25.712 --> 00:01:31.676]  They don't have cameras in the House of Lords, but they do have it in the House of Commons.
[00:01:32.457 --> 00:01:37.601]  And like an absolute fool, I meant to record this exchange Sunday night.
[00:01:38.061 --> 00:01:49.671]  They are at one time Prime Minister's Questions, because I was going to use that clip in the new World Government film I'm making, and now... I don't think C-SPAN has that video available.
[00:01:50.393 --> 00:01:53.456]  Did somebody out there take Prime Minister's questions?
[00:01:53.536 --> 00:01:56.258]  Or does somebody in England have Prime Minister's questions?
[00:01:56.298 --> 00:01:58.800]  Can someone drop that in the mail for me?
[00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:02.764]  I would kiss your feet because I really need that.
[00:02:03.084 --> 00:02:08.689]  I also need a high-quality video clip of Stan Jones when he exposed the North American Union.
[00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.194]  The Senate candidate from Wyoming, he says he's mailing me a copy of it.
[00:02:14.234 --> 00:02:15.214]  I haven't got it yet.
[00:02:15.835 --> 00:02:17.496]  It may be in the mail, but I don't know.
[00:02:18.576 --> 00:02:22.658]  I'm working on this new film right now and I'm already digressing off of the news and information.
[00:02:23.298 --> 00:02:28.980]  But this is the type of stuff we deal with because we need to show the general public when they watch this new film it won't be out for six, seven, eight months.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.322]  A large portion of my life will be spent making it on top of all the other duties.
[00:02:33.702 --> 00:02:35.683]  We need to show them this is a real discussion.
[00:02:36.123 --> 00:02:36.783]  This is real.
[00:02:36.823 --> 00:02:37.563]  This is happening.
[00:02:38.344 --> 00:02:47.087]  Because I can have giant troop carrying ships landing and foreign troops disgorging and openly saying they're here to confiscate our guns and people watch it.
[00:02:48.078 --> 00:02:55.244]  And they believe that I spent fifty million dollars hiring the Coronado aircraft carrier is basically what it is.
[00:02:55.264 --> 00:02:56.105]  It's a little bit smaller.
[00:02:56.125 --> 00:02:57.285]  It's a marine aircraft carrier.
[00:02:57.686 --> 00:03:00.068]  They believe I hired Cobra gunships.
[00:03:00.088 --> 00:03:04.711]  They believe I hired Jolly Green Giants, Sequoias.
[00:03:05.812 --> 00:03:06.353]  They believe it.
[00:03:06.993 --> 00:03:12.918]  And so if I can show them Tony Blair, if I can show them, you know, that they will believe.
[00:03:14.059 --> 00:03:15.460]  And by the way, I mean literally, I've had
[00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:19.520]  It's gotta be more than 20, 30 times over the years.
[00:03:19.681 --> 00:03:22.802]  Emails and letters and calls where people just say it's fake, it's not real.
[00:03:22.842 --> 00:03:25.144]  What's in Police State 2000 isn't real.
[00:03:26.365 --> 00:03:35.510]  Oh, just like ABC News with the gun confiscations in New Orleans showing the troops taking people's guns, even in the high and dry wealthy areas, that wasn't real either, was it?
[00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:38.612]  Or the North American Union Bush sign, that's not real either.
[00:03:38.672 --> 00:03:41.354]  I just don't know what to say.
[00:03:41.654 --> 00:03:45.056]  It's the level of denial, the willful
[00:03:45.885 --> 00:03:54.330]  Denial out there, and let me just assure people, with Police Day 2000, you could have gone and looked at the Marine Corps website.
[00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:56.711]  They took photos of what they were doing and they were proud of it.
[00:03:57.832 --> 00:03:58.512]  Urban Warrior, 99.
[00:04:00.073 --> 00:04:02.154]  You could have gone to any of the drills yourself.
[00:04:02.194 --> 00:04:04.175]  You could have pulled up local news articles about it.
[00:04:04.716 --> 00:04:06.837]  But you see, we have cowards in this country.
[00:04:08.558 --> 00:04:09.859]  They know deep down it's true.
[00:04:09.919 --> 00:04:11.339]  They just want to deny it.
[00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:13.961]  You've got to slap them upside the head.
[00:04:14.631 --> 00:04:16.272]  With things like Stan Jones.
[00:04:16.932 --> 00:04:19.834]  You've got to slap them upside the head with things like Prime Minister's Questions.
[00:04:20.354 --> 00:04:21.795]  Where all of this is coming out.
[00:04:21.855 --> 00:04:22.955]  Alright, I've already digressed.
[00:04:24.436 --> 00:04:27.338]  We've got Norman Baker joining us from the UK.
[00:04:27.578 --> 00:04:33.861]  Then we have Mike Malloy fired for talking about 9-11 and other issues from Air America.
[00:04:34.481 --> 00:04:35.702]  He'll be here with us in the third hour.
[00:04:35.762 --> 00:04:37.343]  Wide open phones for the full three hours.
[00:04:38.103 --> 00:04:40.325]  When we get back, Iran condemns U.S.
[00:04:40.345 --> 00:04:42.886]  Gulf War exercises and a lot more.
[00:04:43.621 --> 00:04:50.164]  PrisonPlanet.com, InfoWars.com, InfoWars.net, JonesReport.com, or just some of the websites.
[00:04:50.565 --> 00:04:51.625]  Check them out today.
[00:04:52.166 --> 00:04:52.906]  We'll be right back.
[00:05:04.267 --> 00:05:07.428]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[00:05:07.788 --> 00:05:09.728]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[00:05:10.088 --> 00:05:17.750]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:25.471]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:05:25.872 --> 00:05:32.733]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying,
[00:05:33.263 --> 00:05:37.285]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:05:37.605 --> 00:05:41.106]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:05:41.566 --> 00:05:43.467]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:05:43.827 --> 00:05:47.748]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:06:19.949 --> 00:06:23.372]  So effective you can drink raw, untreated water from lakes, rivers and streams.
[00:06:23.692 --> 00:06:33.041]  Unlike other sport bottles, the Sport Berkey's patented filter formulation is so powerful it removes cysts, parasites, harmful bacteria, and chemicals like herbicides and pesticides.
[00:06:33.301 --> 00:06:36.805]  It even reduces radon-222, lead, and other heavy metals.

[00:07:00.397 --> 00:07:08.920]  According to a recent report by the National Institute of Health, high blood pressure is a major risk factor for heart disease and the chief risk factor for stroke and heart failure.
[00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:10.961]  It affects about 50 million Americans.
[00:07:11.161 --> 00:07:12.321]  That's one in four adults.
[00:07:12.677 --> 00:07:18.781]  Because many people have high blood pressure for years without knowing it, the American Heart Association calls it the silent killer.
[00:07:19.041 --> 00:07:22.724]  At ResearchedHerbs.com, we recognize your concern for your well-being.

[00:08:02.381 --> 00:08:08.427]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:09.027 --> 00:08:12.010]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:26.027 --> 00:08:40.031]  We do have Norman Baker, member of the British Parliament, who a week and a half ago confronted Tony Blair, His Majesty, on his Bilderberg Group membership, and he'll be coming on with us to talk about that and a host of other issues.
[00:08:40.091 --> 00:08:49.493]  I mean, obviously, of Norman Baker's confronting Tony Blair on his membership in the elite Bilderberg Group, the true governing council of the planet today.
[00:08:50.405 --> 00:08:54.868]  You can tell he's a pretty interesting fellow, so we'll be talking about a host of issues coming up.
[00:08:54.908 --> 00:09:09.536]  And then Mike Malloy, who was fired from Air America, among other things, for speaking out against the official story of 9-11, allowing myself and many others to come on, on all of those affiliates.
[00:09:09.556 --> 00:09:10.836]  They have quite a few affiliates.
[00:09:10.856 --> 00:09:16.840]  I mean, they've got affiliates in Austin, affiliates in Dallas, affiliates in San Antonio, affiliates in Corpus Christi.
[00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:18.941]  I mean, I know right here in Texas you can hear them in every city.
[00:09:19.771 --> 00:09:26.357]  He was one of the only hosts there, in fact the only host, who would actually go on the air and talk about Inside Job.
[00:09:26.998 --> 00:09:29.460]  He got fired once, and now he's been fired twice.
[00:09:30.481 --> 00:09:32.843]  And that really is the Democrats for you, isn't it?
[00:09:33.563 --> 00:09:36.506]  Mike Malloy, former CNN and a high-level producer.
[00:09:37.687 --> 00:09:38.768]  And what did he say on the show?
[00:09:38.808 --> 00:09:40.349]  He said, buy guns.
[00:09:40.469 --> 00:09:44.493]  He said it's time to buy guns to defend yourself against this tyranny.
[00:09:46.266 --> 00:09:49.567]  I mean, how did it become a sacrament of the liberals to be anti-gun?
[00:09:49.947 --> 00:09:50.807]  It makes no sense.
[00:09:50.847 --> 00:09:51.428]  It's stupid.
[00:09:52.268 --> 00:09:53.828]  So I like people like Mike Malloy.
[00:09:53.868 --> 00:10:09.773]  I like Democrats like David Van Oss, running for the Attorney General here in Texas, who's filed affidavits that he will use his office to block the NAFTA highway and the subsect of that system, the trans-Texas enslavement grid.
[00:10:09.973 --> 00:10:11.434]  It's not even a toll road.
[00:10:11.494 --> 00:10:14.575]  It's a hijacking of the infrastructure.
[00:10:15.262 --> 00:10:18.504]  Hank Gilbert running for Ag Commissioner.
[00:10:18.805 --> 00:10:21.727]  Again, they've all got A-plus ratings from the NRA.
[00:10:22.387 --> 00:10:23.188]  They're good people.
[00:10:25.810 --> 00:10:31.353]  But a few people locally have emailed me and asked me, and I'm going to talk about local politics here for a second, then I'll get into all the news.
[00:10:31.393 --> 00:10:32.294]  And boys, there are a lot of it.
[00:10:33.275 --> 00:10:36.077]  They've asked me, why are you supporting Democrats?
[00:10:37.231 --> 00:10:51.377]  I'm not supporting that witch, Nancy Pelosi, who says she's going to block any impeachment investigation of George W. Bush and his crime gang, his crime family, and those that control that crime family, the Rockefellers.
[00:10:51.937 --> 00:10:52.817]  As Bush Sr.
[00:10:52.857 --> 00:10:54.278]  said, he's a Rockefeller Republican.
[00:10:56.679 --> 00:11:02.241]  I'm against Bill Clinton, who vacations with the Bushes and is on their payroll, and who they call a surrogate son.
[00:11:03.027 --> 00:11:20.460]  Remember George Bush, when he first got in office, his first act, the day after his swearing in, was to tell Dan Burton to drop his investigation and to try to use the executive branch to pressure Dan Burton, a good congressman, to not investigate Clinton pardons of convicted drug dealers and other criminals.
[00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:22.922]  I mean, we could have had Clinton in prison, no problem.
[00:11:24.202 --> 00:11:24.823]  No problem.
[00:11:26.582 --> 00:11:34.826]  So you've got the Republicans and Democrats teamed up against the American people, and I know that most of us consciously understand that, but we need to understand it in our gut.
[00:11:36.787 --> 00:11:54.475]  And so if a candidate's a libertarian, if a candidate's an independent, if a candidate's a Green, if a candidate's a Constitution Party, if a candidate is alternative and has got a good record and is somebody who you think you can trust, you should support them and forget, quote, the lesser of two evils with the Republicans and the Democrats.
[00:11:56.698 --> 00:11:58.839]  And so locally, you know, that is a microcosm of it.
[00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:11.906]  In fact, up on JonesReport.com, we've got about a ten-minute segment that's just indicative of the hundreds of speeches that Hank Gilbert and David Vanoss both have been in studio.
[00:12:12.667 --> 00:12:17.129]  Both are multi-generation Texans, unlike all these carpet-bagging Republicans.
[00:12:18.410 --> 00:12:20.411]  And really, that's who the Republicans are predominantly.
[00:12:20.891 --> 00:12:22.172]  Nothing against folks from up north.
[00:12:22.212 --> 00:12:26.054]  If I came up there and was trying to run things, you'd probably call me an outlander.
[00:12:26.661 --> 00:12:29.923]  Or a interloper, or a invader.
[00:12:31.164 --> 00:12:33.185]  Whatever you wish, whatever you like.
[00:12:33.605 --> 00:12:34.665]  As you like it, call it.
[00:12:35.446 --> 00:12:36.526]  It's just disgusting.
[00:12:37.467 --> 00:12:46.052]  But the video we've got up there is they're openly talking about if they pass this Trans-Texas Corridor and the NAFTA system, you're going to have the Second Amendment.
[00:12:46.112 --> 00:12:47.092]  It's going to be worse than that.
[00:12:47.112 --> 00:12:48.473]  It's going to be war on the streets.
[00:12:49.554 --> 00:12:50.674]  It's going to be a revolution.
[00:12:50.734 --> 00:12:52.475]  Crowds of hundreds of people cheering.
[00:12:53.376 --> 00:12:55.497]  I mean, we've had cameras at events where you've got
[00:12:56.832 --> 00:13:00.614]  1,100 people, and every one of them screaming that they're going to go to war.
[00:13:01.514 --> 00:13:05.055]  Old women are getting up saying they're going to shoot anybody that comes on their property.
[00:13:05.595 --> 00:13:13.418]  I mean, this is the beginning of it, and it's Republicans, it's Democrats, it's Libertarians, it's freedom lovers, together saying no to tyranny.
[00:13:14.859 --> 00:13:16.199]  What do you think started the war in 1776?
[00:13:17.780 --> 00:13:23.642]  Decades of land grabbing from property owners, decades of gun confiscation,
[00:13:24.918 --> 00:13:39.284]  Decades of taxation and arrogance and nepotism by the government and the regional governors and turning the local legislatures into rubber stamps of the empire and the regional appointed boards.
[00:13:39.804 --> 00:13:41.205]  Everything that's happening now!
[00:13:44.847 --> 00:13:51.990]  There is a rebel spirit, a spirit of freedom that still burns in our fat and dim
[00:13:54.335 --> 00:13:57.737]  Vestiges of what we once were as a society.
[00:13:57.777 --> 00:13:59.998]  But our bones are mighty.
[00:14:00.338 --> 00:14:04.199]  Our sinews, our core, goes back to what America once was.
[00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:18.606]  And compared to the chicken-necked elitists, we, you know, even in our debilitated, decadent, poisoned state, and we're drunk on entertainment and lavishments, still we're going to crush the enemy.
[00:14:19.722 --> 00:14:24.406]  I just briefly wanted to say a few locals have asked me why I'm supporting Kinky Freedman for Governor.
[00:14:25.327 --> 00:14:36.255]  We've got Kinky Freedman and Bell and Strayhorn, Rylander, Neal Conner and we've got Perry, Mr. Twinkle Toes.
[00:14:37.016 --> 00:14:46.163]  We've got all these people running and we've got Jim Dillon running and boy are they all a group of characters there.
[00:14:47.699 --> 00:14:48.700]  Every single one of them.
[00:14:48.920 --> 00:14:49.541]  Very colorful.
[00:14:52.123 --> 00:14:53.524]  A motley crew, you could say.
[00:14:53.544 --> 00:14:57.367]  I don't trust Strayhorn as far as you can throw her.
[00:14:58.588 --> 00:15:04.212]  I mean, she's a consummate politician going back almost 40 years, 35 years.
[00:15:04.833 --> 00:15:06.894]  She's been married into a bunch of power families.
[00:15:06.934 --> 00:15:08.756]  Her son was White House Press Secretary.
[00:15:09.476 --> 00:15:13.520]  She's pulled a bunch of different scams, basically.
[00:15:18.015 --> 00:15:24.918]  I mean, I remember one time on some sales text thing, I was like a week late filing some form and she seized my whole bank account.
[00:15:25.498 --> 00:15:27.739]  So, I mean, that's why I don't like Strayhorn.
[00:15:28.179 --> 00:15:32.221]  And she can go to the toll party meeting and pat you on the head and tell you what you want to hear.
[00:15:32.661 --> 00:15:35.322]  And everybody can, oh, you can fall down and worship her.
[00:15:35.822 --> 00:15:37.583]  But I was sitting there looking at her right in the eye.
[00:15:37.623 --> 00:15:38.984]  She was there playing everybody.
[00:15:39.444 --> 00:15:44.086]  She had that predatory look in her eye.
[00:15:46.178 --> 00:15:48.880]  And again, this is a national show.
[00:15:48.900 --> 00:15:51.062]  I don't mean to talk about what's happening here in Texas all day.
[00:15:51.122 --> 00:15:55.865]  It's just that it's a microcosm, and it is the front line on so many issues.
[00:15:55.905 --> 00:15:57.106]  This is a bellwether.
[00:15:57.666 --> 00:16:02.970]  This is a major jump point for what the New World Order is doing.
[00:16:04.191 --> 00:16:07.153]  And so I didn't endorse Kinky Friedman until I had him in studio.
[00:16:07.193 --> 00:16:09.775]  I'd read up on a lot of the ideas and plans he had.
[00:16:09.795 --> 00:16:13.157]  And sure, a lot of his campaign is a publicity stunt.
[00:16:13.177 --> 00:16:14.558]  I mean, he does want to be governor.
[00:16:15.518 --> 00:16:24.642]  And then I found out, right before I interviewed him, that his dad was my dad's guidance counselor at the University of Texas, and that they were actually friends.
[00:16:25.142 --> 00:16:39.009]  And then I found out that my grandfather was in the same unit, I guess in North Africa and then in Italy, with B-17s, and he wasn't in the same plane as my dad's dad, but he was in the plane that was in their group.
[00:16:39.469 --> 00:16:43.811]  He knew him, they were friends with Kinky Friedman's uncle.
[00:16:45.033 --> 00:16:46.134]  He's a real Texan.
[00:16:46.174 --> 00:16:47.395]  My family knows him.
[00:16:47.876 --> 00:16:51.179]  We keep running into each other over the years.
[00:16:51.539 --> 00:16:54.162]  I know he's got a dog sanctuary out there.
[00:16:54.182 --> 00:16:55.443]  I know people that have been out there to see him.
[00:16:55.743 --> 00:16:57.605]  He really does take care of rescued animals.
[00:16:58.746 --> 00:16:59.847]  He's got a sweet heart.
[00:17:00.627 --> 00:17:02.149]  Of course, he's a complete nut.
[00:17:04.116 --> 00:17:17.631]  But I was vindicated for supporting Kinky Friedman when the entire apparatchik of B-Lo and the Dallas Morning News and all the other papers piled on and attacked Kinky Friedman.
[00:17:18.472 --> 00:17:22.736]  You listen to conservative radio and 9 out of 10 callers are calling in supporting him.
[00:17:23.077 --> 00:17:23.998]  They don't support Perry.
[00:17:25.311 --> 00:17:29.552]  And again, the media is piling on to attack him right now.
[00:17:30.012 --> 00:17:35.994]  And now they've shifted gears and they're attacking all the alternative candidates, telling you that Perry's the winner, don't bother voting for anybody else.
[00:17:37.154 --> 00:17:38.995]  And I just wish Perry would be running for office.
[00:17:39.035 --> 00:17:40.055]  He probably won't be.
[00:17:40.375 --> 00:17:42.376]  He'll probably really lose, but it won't matter.
[00:17:42.416 --> 00:17:45.737]  They've got the voting machines in many areas of the state.
[00:17:46.937 --> 00:17:52.499]  Again, the national average is 35% of the country has Help America Vote Act, CIA-controlled systems in place.
[00:17:53.374 --> 00:17:57.276]  Texas has about 50% so it's real sad.
[00:17:57.296 --> 00:17:58.356]  It's real sad.
[00:18:00.777 --> 00:18:05.299]  But that is the basics there and so I'm done talking about local politics.
[00:18:05.319 --> 00:18:11.121]  When we get back I've got a clip where Bush is contradicting himself.
[00:18:11.161 --> 00:18:12.821]  He's saying he never said stay the course.
[00:18:13.282 --> 00:18:17.043]  Just like he never said that they didn't have warrantless surveillance.
[00:18:17.063 --> 00:18:21.325]  Just like he never said torture was okay which he did say four years ago.
[00:18:21.365 --> 00:18:21.785]  Just like he
[00:18:22.990 --> 00:18:24.791]  Just like it isn't an amnesty, but it is.
[00:18:25.131 --> 00:18:27.712]  Just like he didn't triple the size of the BATF, but he did.
[00:18:28.713 --> 00:18:33.535]  It's a sick joke, so when we get back, we'll play that clip.
[00:18:33.915 --> 00:18:41.779]  We've also got one concerning how they basically enslave people and how they do horrible things to them in North Korea.
[00:18:42.659 --> 00:18:46.261]  And this will sound like it's a hit piece against North Korea, but really it's a whitewash.
[00:18:46.941 --> 00:18:48.862]  And I want to play this CNN clip and analyze it.
[00:18:49.585 --> 00:19:16.703]  We have another Saturday Night Live piece that's an imitation of Brett Hume, imitating from Fox News, it's an imitation of Brett Hume interviewing George Bush, and I remember seeing the interview online, it's not even really a joke, they just reenacted the interview, and it illustrates just how arrogant these people are, and the fact that Bush
[00:19:17.666 --> 00:19:22.010]  is just completely asleep at the wheel, but it doesn't really matter because he's a puppet.
[00:19:22.310 --> 00:19:24.572]  Then we'll get into Iran condemns U.S.
[00:19:24.692 --> 00:19:25.793]  Gulf exercise.
[00:19:25.833 --> 00:19:26.634]  Really serious news.
[00:19:27.034 --> 00:19:29.056]  Chicago voter database hacked.
[00:19:29.136 --> 00:19:30.117]  This is out of ABC.
[00:19:31.778 --> 00:19:34.440]  Also, why did the Democrats block Bush's rampages?
[00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:39.264]  The end of habeas corpus and belligerent despot-in-chief by Ralph Nader.
[00:19:39.945 --> 00:19:43.247]  Bush uses gay rights flag as backdrop for ABC interview.
[00:19:44.448 --> 00:19:46.270]  Bush is letting everybody know he's a member of the team.
[00:19:47.378 --> 00:19:49.799]  Don't worry, they got male prostitutes in there every night.
[00:19:51.239 --> 00:19:51.839]  I mean, come on.
[00:19:52.979 --> 00:19:55.120]  Bush, uh... I'm not gonna say it.
[00:19:56.960 --> 00:19:57.601]  We'll be right back.
[00:19:59.661 --> 00:20:05.222]  Hi folks, Jack Browner from Midas Resources.
[00:20:05.543 --> 00:20:06.583]  The real money folks.

[00:20:18.186 --> 00:20:20.566]  A 5% increase.
[00:20:21.106 --> 00:20:27.028]  The dollar's value has dropped from $0.96 to $0.70 against the euro.
[00:20:27.128 --> 00:20:30.369]  A 24% decrease in spending power against the gold-backed euro.
[00:20:31.109 --> 00:20:33.470]  Gold has gone from the $3.90s to the $440s.
[00:20:33.490 --> 00:20:36.750]  A 16% increase in real money.
[00:20:37.351 --> 00:20:40.391]  Precious metals are the safe haven in today's hectic marketplace.

[00:23:02.732 --> 00:23:05.214]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:23:05.234 --> 00:23:12.339]  Did you know that there is a concentration camp program that was designed during the Ronald Reagan administration called Rex 84?
[00:23:13.080 --> 00:23:18.304]  This program is designed to imprison anyone whom the federal government deems an enemy of the state.
[00:23:19.044 --> 00:23:30.793]  A judge in Houston, Texas declared that the plaintiff had proven that there was such a program that existed, but no one had been harmed or imprisoned by it, so he declared it unconstitutional and dismissed the case.
[00:23:31.613 --> 00:23:39.296]  We would like to help you understand how these things are coming to pass by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[00:24:29.503 --> 00:24:30.103]  800-259-9231.
[00:24:31.864 --> 00:24:43.209]  Here is the clip with Dick Armey, and he's on national television being questioned about Bush contradicting himself.
[00:24:43.289 --> 00:24:47.091]  And this is, of course, Fox News with Alan Combs asking the questions.
[00:24:47.511 --> 00:24:48.051]  Go ahead and roll it.
[00:24:49.228 --> 00:24:53.550]  The war on terror, how it's being fought in Iraq and almost anything else, and polls bear that out.
[00:24:53.810 --> 00:24:57.052]  Here's what President Bush said over the weekend to George Stephanopoulos.
[00:24:58.752 --> 00:25:00.593]  Listen, we've never been stayed, of course, George.
[00:25:00.993 --> 00:25:02.954]  We have been, we will complete the mission.
[00:25:03.774 --> 00:25:05.475]  Here's some of his previous statements.
[00:25:08.357 --> 00:25:09.237]  My message today
[00:25:10.194 --> 00:25:12.078]  Uh, to those in Iraq, is we'll stay the course.
[00:25:12.238 --> 00:25:13.540]  We will stay the course.
[00:25:13.961 --> 00:25:16.947]  We will help this young Iraqi democracy succeed.
[00:25:17.307 --> 00:25:19.652]  And that's why we're gonna stay the course in Iraq.
[00:25:20.276 --> 00:25:23.239]  So I guess he was going to stay the course before he wasn't going to stay the course.
[00:25:23.319 --> 00:25:23.719]  Right, Dick?
[00:25:25.020 --> 00:25:27.462]  Well, yeah, I don't quite understand that.
[00:25:28.283 --> 00:25:30.364]  I think he's been saying we'll stay the course.
[00:25:30.424 --> 00:25:31.525]  I think that's what he's saying.
[00:25:31.565 --> 00:25:40.893]  That was, of course, a great line from the early Reagan presidency with respect to economic policy and, of course, correctly put by Reagan at that time.
[00:25:41.333 --> 00:25:45.517]  In that circumstance, I'm not sure the line is serving the president well right now.
[00:25:45.817 --> 00:25:50.820]  Alright, Laura, it seems like, and then we'll have to John Kerry, was it before the $83 million, before he was against the $83 million?
[00:25:51.201 --> 00:25:56.024]  George W. Bush was going to stay the course before he all of a sudden isn't going to stay the course.
[00:25:56.044 --> 00:25:59.186]  Or listen to the generals now for a change, and give them what they want on the ground.
[00:25:59.226 --> 00:26:00.347]  No, absolutely.
[00:26:00.407 --> 00:26:02.048]  I mean, this is a message game.
[00:26:02.108 --> 00:26:02.748]  It's a word game.
[00:26:04.229 --> 00:26:05.210]  It is a word game.
[00:26:05.230 --> 00:26:06.771]  That's exactly what they're doing.
[00:26:06.811 --> 00:26:10.173]  Let's go ahead and play part of this Saturday Night Live clip.
[00:26:10.808 --> 00:26:16.171]  This is where, again, they're imitating Brett Hume and George Bush having an interview and George Bush is saying nothing back.
[00:26:16.871 --> 00:26:17.291]  Here it is.
[00:26:18.812 --> 00:26:20.473]  Welcome back.
[00:26:37.794 --> 00:26:38.354]  Welcome back.
[00:26:38.394 --> 00:26:43.357]  Political observers are calling the up-term, mid-term elections a referendum on the war in Iraq.
[00:26:43.877 --> 00:26:46.579]  Are we making progress, or as we have some alleged, stuck?
[00:26:47.059 --> 00:26:49.760]  Is it time to stay the course, or cut and run?
[00:26:50.421 --> 00:26:55.443]  Those decisions, of course, ultimately fall on the shoulders of one man, our Commander-in-Chief, George W. Bush.
[00:26:56.043 --> 00:26:58.945]  Here now is Part One of my very special interview.
[00:27:06.283 --> 00:27:08.325]  Thank you for taking the time, Mr. President.
[00:27:08.605 --> 00:27:09.366]  Anytime, Britt.
[00:27:09.566 --> 00:27:10.206]  Anytime.
[00:27:11.487 --> 00:27:18.213]  Mr. President, polls show that the majority of Americans think that the most important issue facing our country right now is the war in Iraq.
[00:27:19.194 --> 00:27:23.257]  But the news coming out of that part of the world is not all rosy.
[00:27:23.637 --> 00:27:24.098]  No, it's not.
[00:27:24.458 --> 00:27:24.598]  No.
[00:27:25.179 --> 00:27:27.681]  Terror attacks have intensified to near record levels.
[00:27:28.481 --> 00:27:29.362]  This month, the U.S.
[00:27:29.402 --> 00:27:30.683]  has already totaled 53 casualties.
[00:27:32.159 --> 00:27:35.041]  Making October the deadliest month in nearly two years.
[00:27:35.341 --> 00:27:35.541]  Yeah.
[00:27:36.082 --> 00:27:40.044]  Uh-huh.
[00:27:40.745 --> 00:27:44.967]  According to one recent study, the number of Iraqi civilian casualties may run as high as 600,000.
[00:27:45.548 --> 00:27:52.412]  Some also claim that the United States has been unable to provide the Iraqi civilians with any lasting security.
[00:27:52.612 --> 00:27:53.192]  Yeah, that's right.
[00:27:53.573 --> 00:27:53.753]  Uh-huh.
[00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:08.467]  For example, when Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice visited Baghdad last week, she was forced to circle the airport for over 40 minutes due to mortar fire.
[00:28:08.928 --> 00:28:09.148]  Right.
[00:28:11.870 --> 00:28:15.153]  Then be helicoptered into the city because the highway is impassable.
[00:28:15.834 --> 00:28:21.378]  Then she had to meet with President Talabani in the dark because the electricity had been cut off.
[00:28:22.219 --> 00:28:23.020]  Well, she's a trooper.
[00:28:26.366 --> 00:28:45.923]  As a part of your program of general debathification, the Iraqi army was immediately dissolved, flooding the streets with local militias made up of former Iraqi army officers, a policy that Newt Gingrich, a Republican, has called the largest single disaster in American foreign policy in modern times.
[00:28:46.363 --> 00:28:47.044]  That's what he said.
[00:28:51.768 --> 00:28:53.930]  Moreover, the recent national intelligence estimate
[00:28:54.950 --> 00:28:59.873]  Suggests that the unrest in Iraq may be creating more terrorists rather than reducing the numbers.
[00:29:00.053 --> 00:29:00.514]  I've heard that.
[00:29:00.854 --> 00:29:02.455]  Yeah.
[00:29:03.176 --> 00:29:05.337]  You've thrown out portions of the Geneva Convention.
[00:29:05.497 --> 00:29:05.637]  Yep.
[00:29:05.877 --> 00:29:08.019]  Your approval ratings are hovering in the low 30s.
[00:29:08.079 --> 00:29:08.339]  Right.
[00:29:10.120 --> 00:29:20.087]  As the lion's share of our troops are committed elsewhere, we have no credible military response to North Korea, a country that, unlike Iraq, definitely has weapons of mass destruction.
[00:29:20.387 --> 00:29:20.947]  They sure do.
[00:29:21.207 --> 00:29:21.588]  Sure.
[00:29:21.628 --> 00:29:21.848]  Yeah.
[00:29:25.060 --> 00:29:35.322]  Now there's news that in an overwhelming display of force, the Shiite militia led by rebel cleric Muqtada al-Sadr briefly took the city of Amara in an area once considered safe.
[00:29:36.302 --> 00:29:42.604]  So, Mr. President, considering all these factors, my question to you is, can we win this war in Iraq?
[00:29:45.264 --> 00:29:46.164]  Absolutely, Britt.
[00:29:46.584 --> 00:29:48.005]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:48.445 --> 00:29:48.965]  Stay with us.
[00:29:51.705 --> 00:29:52.606]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.086 --> 00:29:54.606]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.618 --> 00:29:58.379]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.899 --> 00:30:04.400]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network.
[00:30:04.500 --> 00:30:06.880]  I have an urgent message for all of our listeners.
[00:30:06.940 --> 00:30:14.002]  The mass media keeps telling us that we are the richest, most powerful economy in the world, quote unquote.
[00:30:14.602 --> 00:30:16.882]  If this is true, why can't we pay our bills?
[00:30:17.542 --> 00:30:21.023]  Why is the United States the world's largest debtor nation?
[00:30:21.633 --> 00:30:25.774]  The truth is that we are in the worst debt bubble in our nation's history.
[00:30:26.334 --> 00:30:29.334]  When the bubble bursts, will you be able to feed your family?
[00:30:30.294 --> 00:30:33.235]  When the inevitable crash occurs, will you be ready?
[00:30:33.955 --> 00:30:36.556]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.
[00:30:36.696 --> 00:30:39.936]  That's 1-888-892-6238 for the following two free reports.
[00:30:39.956 --> 00:30:39.996]  U.S.
[00:30:40.036 --> 00:30:42.297]  Debt Bubble, Red Alert, and Real Estate Crash.
[00:30:51.815 --> 00:30:54.118]  Call 888-8XANADU.
[00:30:54.178 --> 00:30:58.364]  That's 888-8XANADU.
[00:30:58.704 --> 00:30:59.666]  And ask for George.
[00:31:01.621 --> 00:31:02.581]  Good morning, honey!
[00:31:02.942 --> 00:31:03.502]  Wow!
[00:31:03.662 --> 00:31:08.944]  The weather is beautiful, the cabin is terrific, and it's the first day of our vacation!
[00:31:09.224 --> 00:31:09.844]  Yeah.
[00:31:10.225 --> 00:31:11.645]  Honey, is there something wrong?
[00:31:12.005 --> 00:31:15.387]  Yeah, I just realized we forgot to pack the travel berkey system.
[00:31:15.867 --> 00:31:17.368]  I can't drink this cabin water.
[00:31:17.808 --> 00:31:19.509]  And what am I going to do when I'm out on the lake?
[00:31:19.889 --> 00:31:21.669]  Now the whole vacation is ruined.
[00:31:21.870 --> 00:31:22.710]  Honey, cheer up!
[00:31:23.154 --> 00:31:25.395]  I brought our Sport Berkey Purifiers!
[00:31:25.655 --> 00:31:25.975]  What?
[00:31:26.415 --> 00:31:36.900]  Yeah, I know you're picky about not having pathogenic bacteria, organic chemicals, heavy metals or foul tastes and odors in the water, so I packed our Sport Berkey Purifiers!
[00:31:37.180 --> 00:31:42.002]  You know, this is a terrific cabin, and wow, have you noticed the beautiful weather?
[00:31:42.342 --> 00:31:43.522]  Don't ruin your vacation.

[00:31:57.686 --> 00:31:59.387]  Travel Berkey not available in Iowa.
[00:32:00.607 --> 00:32:06.549]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism, but globalism.
[00:32:15.461 --> 00:32:16.661]  Nationalism is nationalism.
[00:32:17.042 --> 00:32:19.042]  Start reading The Nationalist Times each month.
[00:32:19.302 --> 00:32:24.684]  The Nationalist Times promotes a common sense, intelligent, and passionate alternative to the reigning party line.
[00:32:24.984 --> 00:32:33.707]  Published monthly since 1985, The Nationalist Times is a 20-page newspaper featuring outstanding writers and columnists who don't believe in taboos or sacred cows.
[00:32:33.987 --> 00:32:37.048]  Be one of the many thousands of loyal readers of The Nationalist Times.
[00:32:37.108 --> 00:32:39.229]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents
[00:33:08.436 --> 00:33:10.817]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:33:10.837 --> 00:33:25.724]  All of the things that Saturday Night Live was doing on NBC, everything they were saying is true and has really happened.
[00:33:26.825 --> 00:33:31.447]  And watching the real interview, Bush said only a few more words than that.
[00:33:32.307 --> 00:33:36.930]  He really has nothing to say, I guess because it was a sit-down interview without a teleprompter.
[00:33:38.943 --> 00:33:46.967]  Even with Brett Hume, who is a toady of the White House, probably an operative, just like Tony Snow.
[00:33:46.987 --> 00:33:50.588]  We always knew he was an operative, and now he's just publicly an operative.
[00:33:51.429 --> 00:33:53.550]  Coming up later, we'll get into Iran condemns U.S.
[00:33:53.570 --> 00:33:57.152]  Gulf War exercise, which really is a battle group forming up to attack them.
[00:33:57.652 --> 00:33:59.693]  The question is, will there be an attack on Iran?
[00:34:00.791 --> 00:34:11.433]  The neocons are trying to spin it and say, well yeah, because it shows the danger of WMDs that North Korea is threatening to attack us and nuke Japan and South Korea and the U.S.
[00:34:12.893 --> 00:34:14.774]  So we better go ahead and attack Iran!
[00:34:15.974 --> 00:34:30.377]  It's like if somebody's robbing a liquor store and has their gun to your head, so they're going to blow your head off, and the police pull up out front and say, well wait a minute, we see an old lady walking down the street over there, let's go ahead and gun her down, because she might have a gun too.
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:37.684]  I mean, that's how crazy the psychology of all of this is.
[00:34:39.025 --> 00:34:43.048]  We'll get into the upcoming election and all the election fraud that is guaranteed.
[00:34:43.068 --> 00:34:45.190]  They're telling us, brace for it, lots of problems.
[00:34:45.690 --> 00:34:50.414]  When you hear problem, most of the time you need to insert stolen election.
[00:34:50.974 --> 00:34:52.716]  Because that's what we've seen in the past.
[00:34:53.096 --> 00:34:56.999]  Notice the more of these new special machines they put in, the worse things get.
[00:34:57.479 --> 00:34:59.481]  Your calls and the news are coming up here in a few minutes.
[00:35:01.252 --> 00:35:05.566]  I wanted to remind all of you that we're now carrying Aaron Russo's new film.
[00:35:05.586 --> 00:35:08.675]  It just came out on DVD yesterday.
[00:35:09.881 --> 00:35:12.743]  We have it at Infowars.com.
[00:35:13.243 --> 00:35:29.973]  And I want you to have this film so badly, because it's so important, exposing the root of this problem, the private run-for-profit Federal Reserve, how that expands, of course, into the income tax and the police state we're facing and the North American Union.
[00:35:30.333 --> 00:35:32.574]  He covers it all in this new film.
[00:35:32.594 --> 00:35:34.615]  I want you to have it so when you get it for $19.95,
[00:35:36.460 --> 00:35:39.062]  And that's even lower than the regular retail price.
[00:35:39.102 --> 00:35:40.623]  You get Terror Storm for $9.95.
[00:35:40.723 --> 00:35:45.446]  This is for a limited time.
[00:35:45.867 --> 00:35:47.368]  My 3-hour film Terror Storm.
[00:35:47.408 --> 00:35:51.991]  It's a 2-hour film, but 68 minutes of extras on one DVD.
[00:35:52.051 --> 00:35:55.053]  And then now Aaron Zellman's new film, Freedom to Fascism for $29.95.
[00:35:55.113 --> 00:35:59.776]  That's because I want you to have both of these documentaries.
[00:36:01.017 --> 00:36:01.698]  Do not wait.
[00:36:02.538 --> 00:36:03.219]  Order today.
[00:36:04.053 --> 00:36:14.282]  It's available right now at Infowars.com or you can simply write to me at 3001 South Lamar Suite 100 Austin, TX 78704 or call toll free 888-253-3139 888-253-3139
[00:36:28.121 --> 00:36:35.967]  Or you can also go to PrisonPlanet.tv and get a 15-7 day membership and watch all the PrisonPlanet.tv material there.
[00:36:36.528 --> 00:36:43.693]  All 15 of my films, my book, Paul Watson's book, my weekly TV reports, in-studio video interviews, and much more.
[00:36:44.314 --> 00:36:47.036]  Now we have him on with us once a month and I always enjoy it.
[00:36:47.056 --> 00:36:56.163]  I always enjoy our visits and I will tell the listeners this story briefly yet again for those that weren't aware of it.
[00:36:57.791 --> 00:37:04.877]  Calvin Pure Soap did its first radio advertising with Genesis, I don't know, 5 or 6 years ago.
[00:37:04.897 --> 00:37:16.026]  And I guess that's because Michael Trudeau, who used to be here at the network, good guy, he was into organic stuff and he found this really good, made in America, in his words, cheap organic soap.
[00:37:16.747 --> 00:37:19.729]  Been around since 1949, made right here in the U.S.
[00:37:19.749 --> 00:37:22.632]  in Oakland, California, family owned, 3 generations.
[00:37:23.784 --> 00:37:32.851]  Marty's son works there, and of course, Marty started the business in 1949 with his father, Marty Sacker, and he's on with us right now.
[00:37:33.632 --> 00:37:39.937]  And then, Marty just sent me out of the blue, like a six-month supply, maybe it was a year's supply, a big box.
[00:37:41.438 --> 00:37:46.642]  And it ran out in about a year, and my wife said, where'd you get this stuff you brought to the house?
[00:37:46.682 --> 00:37:47.503]  That is incredible.
[00:37:47.523 --> 00:37:50.105]  And I said, I've never heard you say, soap is incredible.
[00:37:50.345 --> 00:37:51.046]  This is a true story.
[00:37:52.518 --> 00:37:55.900]  And then, I personally got Marty as a sponsor.
[00:37:55.920 --> 00:37:57.841]  I called him and said, you know, I ought to have you as a sponsor.
[00:37:58.782 --> 00:38:03.125]  And then, he sent the office a free year supply.
[00:38:03.485 --> 00:38:14.132]  And so I just, you know, gave folks some of the bars and soaps, some of the shampoos, some of the creams, some of the... And seriously, people started saying, man, what's that smell?
[00:38:14.172 --> 00:38:14.852]  It smells so good.
[00:38:15.152 --> 00:38:16.133]  This is great stuff.
[00:38:16.193 --> 00:38:19.095]  You know, it doesn't give me a rash like some of the other things do.
[00:38:20.294 --> 00:38:21.355]  People really like it.
[00:38:21.436 --> 00:38:25.180]  It really is a great product.
[00:38:25.200 --> 00:38:28.043]  But the big thing is it's made in America.
[00:38:28.083 --> 00:38:30.546]  They support patriotic truth radio.
[00:38:32.651 --> 00:38:34.913]  You save 85% off supermarket prices.
[00:38:34.953 --> 00:38:46.022]  There's a big cartels of Procter and Gamble and Dow Chemical and a few others, and they literally pay the grocery stores and give them huge discounts, like Walmart does, that they make manufacturers sell to them below price.
[00:38:46.482 --> 00:38:47.703]  Well, it's kind of the opposite here.
[00:38:48.044 --> 00:39:00.494]  They come in and deliberately, for many years, would sell many things under price to knock out their competition to where there's really only about three big suppliers, if you look at it, that supply over 90% of all of the detergents and chemicals.
[00:39:01.194 --> 00:39:12.661]  And again, the folks that own Procter & Gamble and Dow Chemical are chemical companies, so they want to sell the byproducts and the things they've already got at the chemical plants, and so it's petroleum products.
[00:39:13.402 --> 00:39:13.842]  It's oil.
[00:39:15.723 --> 00:39:16.584]  It's real bad for you.
[00:39:16.944 --> 00:39:20.686]  And it goes through your skin, into your blood, it gets into your hair, it gets into your clothes.
[00:39:21.267 --> 00:39:22.988]  I remember growing up, I would get rashes.
[00:39:24.255 --> 00:39:25.016]  I'm diatribing.
[00:39:25.056 --> 00:39:26.177]  Marty isn't even on the air with this shit.
[00:39:26.197 --> 00:39:29.099]  I'll end up doing 20 minutes on this and I was meant to have him on for about 6-7 minutes.
[00:39:29.139 --> 00:39:31.661]  But, I mean, this is important the more I think about it.
[00:39:32.762 --> 00:39:40.149]  I remember certain brands of detergent growing up would make me and my dad get red rashes all over us and my mom could only use certain brands of soap.
[00:39:40.329 --> 00:39:44.572]  Well, my children, if we use any of the mainline stuff, get rashes.
[00:39:44.752 --> 00:39:45.673]  I mean, it's not good for you.
[00:39:46.394 --> 00:39:49.957]  You could leave a little bit of Calvin soap, you know, the bar soap, under your arms in the shower.
[00:39:51.084 --> 00:39:53.206]  Boy, you do that with zest or something.
[00:39:53.486 --> 00:39:58.129]  I've been at work years ago and had to go into the bathroom and pull my shirt off.
[00:39:58.189 --> 00:39:59.109]  I bet you've done this.
[00:39:59.950 --> 00:40:03.212]  And literally sit there and splash water under my arms and get soap out of it.
[00:40:03.232 --> 00:40:03.653]  I forgot.
[00:40:03.673 --> 00:40:06.534]  Real soap isn't supposed to do that.
[00:40:06.554 --> 00:40:07.375]  That's a detergent.
[00:40:08.256 --> 00:40:10.457]  Even worse, you ever left any up between your legs?
[00:40:11.498 --> 00:40:13.679]  I've done that once or twice back when I used detergent soap.
[00:40:13.699 --> 00:40:15.621]  You know, a little bit of lather up between your legs.
[00:40:15.641 --> 00:40:17.482]  All of a sudden it starts burning.
[00:40:18.146 --> 00:40:20.387]  Thank you Alex, it's always exciting talking to you and your listeners.
[00:40:41.285 --> 00:40:44.447]  It just makes my day, makes my year, makes my month.
[00:40:44.848 --> 00:40:57.796]  You know, in all my 60 years of marketing soap, I've never received, in the last 10 months, so much praise, love notes, thank you notes, letters, faxes from your listeners.
[00:40:58.236 --> 00:40:58.536]  Ever!
[00:40:59.477 --> 00:41:00.617]  It's good to be loved.
[00:41:01.878 --> 00:41:06.481]  I can't say enough thank yous to your listeners for helping my company grow.
[00:41:07.862 --> 00:41:09.322]  Well, I mean, you're making it in America.
[00:41:09.362 --> 00:41:10.343]  It's a family business.
[00:41:10.363 --> 00:41:11.163]  You save money.
[00:41:11.583 --> 00:41:12.523]  It's not toxic.
[00:41:12.603 --> 00:41:13.503]  I mean, it's a good deal.
[00:41:13.523 --> 00:41:22.326]  Well, getting your recommendations, your sponsorship has really helped, and we appreciate that very much.
[00:41:22.706 --> 00:41:23.926]  Well, we appreciate you, Marty.
[00:41:24.806 --> 00:41:27.167]  Tell folks about a few of the combo packs so they can call you.
[00:41:27.687 --> 00:41:36.629]  Well, to start off, anybody that's skeptical as to buying goods from Procter & Lever and Colgate, that case, I don't want
[00:41:37.179 --> 00:41:38.680]  Two month tote bag.
[00:41:39.180 --> 00:41:50.886]  It's a sampler bag that has enough goods of the bath soap, air soap, dish soap, laundry soap, to last at least two months for a family of four.
[00:41:51.446 --> 00:41:54.168]  And we're so proud to present that.
[00:41:54.788 --> 00:41:55.468]  Get your hook.
[00:41:56.409 --> 00:41:56.769]  Try it.
[00:41:57.149 --> 00:41:59.850]  You will not only like it, you will love it.
[00:42:00.191 --> 00:42:06.834]  We create love affairs with every consumer that uses our original old-fashioned
[00:42:07.321 --> 00:42:09.523]  Marty, you must be on a cordless phone.
[00:42:09.563 --> 00:42:10.303]  It's cutting out a little bit.
[00:42:10.343 --> 00:42:12.025]  We're missing some of what you were just saying.
[00:42:37.711 --> 00:42:38.411]  Can you hear me, Marty?
[00:42:39.072 --> 00:42:39.312]  Yeah.
[00:42:39.712 --> 00:42:40.212]  Okay, good.
[00:42:40.293 --> 00:42:41.473]  You're on a cordless phone, aren't you?
[00:42:41.873 --> 00:42:42.174]  No.
[00:42:42.954 --> 00:42:44.595]  I'm on a direct line.
[00:42:44.815 --> 00:42:45.215]  Wow, wow.
[00:42:46.296 --> 00:42:49.317]  Yeah, it's never cut out before, but we heard most of what you said.
[00:42:49.377 --> 00:42:52.479]  So what, five, six years ago, you made the decision to start selling direct.
[00:42:52.979 --> 00:42:59.823]  I had actually seen your soap one time when I was staying with my parents growing up in a nice hotel when I was a teenager.
[00:43:00.303 --> 00:43:03.445]  Before, you mainly sold to hotels and you sold to hospitals.
[00:43:05.476 --> 00:43:17.563]  Also, to wealthy people who knew what they were doing and what they were buying, and I'm glad that you're now offering this to the general public, give folks the toll-free number to call and get a sampler pack or get a free catalog or to order a six-month or year supply.
[00:43:17.583 --> 00:43:19.204]  Our toll-free number is 800-340-7091.
[00:43:19.284 --> 00:43:23.186]  Call us anytime, day or night, seven days a week, 800-340-7091.
[00:43:32.972 --> 00:43:33.372]  That's right.
[00:43:33.392 --> 00:43:33.572]  1-800-340-7091.
[00:43:33.592 --> 00:43:33.772]  800-340-7091.
[00:43:33.812 --> 00:43:35.213]  We're on the web at 5starsoap.com.
[00:43:35.373 --> 00:43:35.893]  That's right.
[00:43:35.913 --> 00:43:37.234]  Can't forget that.
[00:43:37.254 --> 00:43:37.734]  5starsoap.com.
[00:43:37.774 --> 00:43:38.374]  5starsoap.com.
[00:43:38.474 --> 00:43:43.397]  Or if you missed that web address, you just go to InfoWars.com.
[00:43:51.680 --> 00:43:56.424]  On the left hand side, you see a link there directly to their website.
[00:43:56.444 --> 00:44:06.373]  You can also go to PrisonPlanet.com and we have a text link that's always up there saying 85% off on organic product and so that's a link over to Marty.
[00:44:06.993 --> 00:44:08.395]  Marty, I hope people will call you.
[00:44:08.415 --> 00:44:16.982]  I hope they'll continue to support you and I was really excited to hear that your phones melted off the walls for three days last time we had you on.
[00:44:17.022 --> 00:44:19.104]  I wish we had that type of response here with my videos.
[00:44:19.424 --> 00:44:20.665]  We were going crazy here.
[00:44:20.705 --> 00:44:22.106]  The people kept calling.
[00:44:22.427 --> 00:44:23.447]  They want soap.
[00:44:23.508 --> 00:44:24.809]  They don't want detergents.
[00:44:25.049 --> 00:44:28.592]  They don't want to be ripped off in the marketplace with all these poisons.
[00:44:29.112 --> 00:44:30.814]  And this is what we're there to help you with?
[00:44:30.934 --> 00:44:31.294]  Nothing!
[00:44:31.894 --> 00:44:32.295]  Nothing!
[00:44:32.795 --> 00:44:35.818]  But we offer any marketplace, anywhere.
[00:44:35.838 --> 00:44:37.559]  This is something we are proud of.
[00:44:38.020 --> 00:44:39.801]  I'd like to close with a limerick.
[00:44:40.662 --> 00:44:41.282]  Sure, go ahead.
[00:44:41.803 --> 00:44:48.128]  There was a young monk from Siberia whose life grew drearier and drearier.
[00:44:48.914 --> 00:44:56.160]  So one night, with a yell, he escaped from his cell, and he loped with a mother superior.
[00:44:58.261 --> 00:44:59.882]  Thank you Marty, always good to talk to you.
[00:44:59.903 --> 00:45:00.923]  Thank you Alex, talk to you soon.
[00:45:01.083 --> 00:45:01.704]  You bet, take care.
[00:45:01.724 --> 00:45:02.044]  Bye now.
[00:45:02.745 --> 00:45:03.906]  You bet, if you missed that number, 800-340-7091.
[00:45:03.926 --> 00:45:18.677]  I don't have a lot of sponsors either, because you'll hear a lot of things on the network during the ads, and I don't endorse or necessarily endorse a lot of the things that are advertised, but that's fine, it's a free country.
[00:45:19.943 --> 00:45:23.105]  But if you hear me endorsing something, it means I really do believe in it.
[00:45:24.025 --> 00:45:25.566]  And I'm not claiming I have all the answers.
[00:45:25.986 --> 00:45:26.986]  I just know this is a good deal.
[00:45:27.006 --> 00:45:28.647]  All right, let's hurry through some of your calls.
[00:45:28.667 --> 00:45:33.109]  I don't want to get into this whole Chicago voter database hack that's really important.
[00:45:33.149 --> 00:45:38.392]  Also Iran's up in arms over massive troop buildups right off their coastline and around them.
[00:45:38.412 --> 00:45:42.153]  I guess the storm clouds of war.
[00:45:42.313 --> 00:45:44.134]  Melissa in Florida, thanks for holding.
[00:45:44.174 --> 00:45:44.534]  Welcome.
[00:45:47.496 --> 00:45:48.216]  Hi, how you doing?
[00:45:48.846 --> 00:45:49.607]  I'm doing great.
[00:45:49.807 --> 00:45:50.247]  How are you?
[00:45:50.267 --> 00:45:51.068]  Fine.
[00:45:51.108 --> 00:45:51.529]  Go ahead.
[00:45:52.169 --> 00:45:52.550]  Okay.
[00:45:53.010 --> 00:45:59.336]  I have a clip of a cartoon with Bush Cheney and Hillary about waterboarding and it's a minute long.
[00:46:00.897 --> 00:46:02.919]  And I was wondering if you'd like to hear it.
[00:46:03.139 --> 00:46:03.380]  Sure.
[00:46:03.400 --> 00:46:04.881]  I mean, did you get the clip off the web?
[00:46:05.902 --> 00:46:08.424]  No, it was off television off of Current TV.
[00:46:09.105 --> 00:46:11.427]  But you can go online to view it.
[00:46:11.547 --> 00:46:12.828]  Yeah, you might email it to
[00:46:14.051 --> 00:46:22.798]  To like Aaron at Infowars.com or Ryan at Infowars.com, I don't know if you can link to it, but try putting the receiver, I mean we'll try it, right up against the speaker on the television.
[00:46:22.838 --> 00:46:23.159]  Go ahead.
[00:46:23.939 --> 00:46:27.142]  Okay, I'm playing it online so it'll sound good.
[00:46:27.562 --> 00:46:28.843]  Oh, okay.
[00:46:29.664 --> 00:46:30.945]  Here we go folks, high tech.
[00:46:33.187 --> 00:46:34.128]  PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:46:37.209 --> 00:46:42.015]  George, this detainee bill is nothing less than a license to torture!
[00:46:42.095 --> 00:46:43.016]  Whoa, whoa, whoa!
[00:46:43.036 --> 00:46:44.577]  Hey, get on the torture chain!
[00:46:44.717 --> 00:46:45.979]  No habeas corpus!
[00:46:46.319 --> 00:46:47.100]  Waterboarding?
[00:46:47.560 --> 00:46:48.702]  Who are you?
[00:46:48.722 --> 00:46:50.023]  The Khmer Rouge?
[00:46:50.243 --> 00:46:52.826]  Hey, waterboarding is totally safe!
[00:46:53.086 --> 00:46:53.527]  Prove it!
[00:47:06.850 --> 00:47:08.651]  We can't play it.
[00:47:08.711 --> 00:47:10.692]  Ma'am, well she's going to still be listening to it.
[00:47:10.752 --> 00:47:13.314]  Yeah, it's so loud it's messing up.
[00:47:13.594 --> 00:47:18.996]  That's why I don't like playing clips on air because it just so many times doesn't sound good.
[00:47:19.657 --> 00:47:26.120]  As soon as Melissa comes back we'll bring her back up and let her tell us what's in the clip and then we'll
[00:47:26.860 --> 00:47:32.324]  If she tells us the name of the clip, our internet users can just type the name in to the search engine and find it.
[00:47:33.225 --> 00:47:35.667]  Is Melissa back yet, or is she still playing the clip?
[00:47:38.929 --> 00:47:41.191]  Yeah, just go ahead and let her go.
[00:47:41.671 --> 00:47:42.412]  Sorry, Melissa.
[00:47:42.972 --> 00:47:45.134]  Let's go ahead and talk to Joe in West Virginia.
[00:47:45.634 --> 00:47:46.435]  Joe, you're on the air.
[00:47:46.475 --> 00:47:47.135]  Thanks for holding.
[00:47:47.315 --> 00:47:47.876]  Hey, Alex.
[00:47:47.916 --> 00:47:48.937]  Thanks for taking my call.
[00:47:48.957 --> 00:47:50.638]  Okay, I'll get right down to business here.
[00:47:50.718 --> 00:47:51.919]  Mark of the Beast, okay.
[00:47:52.301 --> 00:47:56.604]  When Jesus was on the earth, he said, the spirit of the beast is already with you.
[00:47:56.904 --> 00:47:57.284]  Okay?
[00:47:57.925 --> 00:47:59.646]  Now, I do a lot of thinking.
[00:47:59.666 --> 00:48:01.868]  I know the government has great minds.
[00:48:02.428 --> 00:48:04.790]  They sit around, they do this thinking thing.
[00:48:05.110 --> 00:48:09.393]  They come up with stuff, just like you say, cause a problem, then offer the fix.
[00:48:09.473 --> 00:48:10.333]  You know, and that's true.
[00:48:14.295 --> 00:48:16.598]  I know for a fact that the beast is the economy.
[00:48:16.659 --> 00:48:17.620]  It's all-consuming.
[00:48:17.680 --> 00:48:18.501]  It takes your time.
[00:48:18.521 --> 00:48:19.242]  You get up in the morning.
[00:48:19.262 --> 00:48:19.963]  You go to work.
[00:48:21.285 --> 00:48:23.389]  You don't have time to spend with your family.
[00:48:23.429 --> 00:48:24.110]  You're in debt.
[00:48:24.430 --> 00:48:26.854]  To me, that's the beast, and I'm sure that I'm correct about that.
[00:48:27.296 --> 00:48:31.619]  Okay, as far as getting the word out, I get the word out about your show.
[00:48:31.639 --> 00:48:33.180]  Well, let me just add, that's the beast.
[00:48:33.680 --> 00:48:36.582]  And then people confuse that, and they're going, no, no, no, it's a mark.
[00:48:36.642 --> 00:48:36.923]  No, no, no.
[00:48:37.343 --> 00:48:39.985]  There's the beast, and there's the mark of the beast.
[00:48:40.045 --> 00:48:43.607]  The beast the mark puts on you is that face scan.
[00:48:44.107 --> 00:48:46.969]  You see, people are waiting for a chip, and I believe it will lead to that.
[00:48:47.490 --> 00:48:49.411]  But it's going to be a DNA chip.
[00:48:49.471 --> 00:48:56.676]  It's going to be a vaccine that's put into you that you can be tracked and traced on, because this is what the government's saying their final plan is.
[00:48:57.316 --> 00:48:58.777]  And it's going to be the face scanning.
[00:48:58.817 --> 00:48:59.998]  It's going to be the thumb scanning.
[00:49:00.018 --> 00:49:02.140]  That's the mark of the head, the mark of the hand.
[00:49:02.180 --> 00:49:03.821]  Well, a beast is all-consuming.
[00:49:03.861 --> 00:49:05.102]  It can't be reasoned with.
[00:49:05.303 --> 00:49:06.223]  It devours.
[00:49:06.403 --> 00:49:08.785]  And to me, that's exactly what a world economy does.
[00:49:08.805 --> 00:49:10.367]  Yeah, that's what this global economy does.
[00:49:10.387 --> 00:49:12.028]  It devours your life.
[00:49:12.128 --> 00:49:14.990]  They set groups of people against each other, too, internationally.
[00:49:15.311 --> 00:49:16.231]  That's right, brother.
[00:49:16.351 --> 00:49:17.372]  And it's horrible.
[00:49:17.492 --> 00:49:23.277]  And it's only through stupidity and ignorance that, well, even Jesus said, my people are destroyed.
[00:49:23.577 --> 00:49:25.679]  Well, anyway, complaining, okay.
[00:49:26.339 --> 00:49:31.481]  Alex, I have a great idea, and I hope your listeners, I'm sure a few of them will understand what I mean by this.
[00:49:32.022 --> 00:49:37.484]  To get the word out, I run copies and make copies, give them out free to truck drivers all the time.
[00:49:37.504 --> 00:49:40.525]  You wouldn't believe how many truck drivers listen to you, buddy.
[00:49:40.585 --> 00:49:43.386]  I'm a 20-year retired trucker, and that's all we have to do is think.
[00:49:43.786 --> 00:49:45.687]  But anyway, here's what I've come up with.
[00:49:45.727 --> 00:49:46.788]  I think it's a great plan.
[00:49:48.399 --> 00:49:53.160]  Instead of saying, these people are bad, these people are bad, why don't we act like we're on their side?
[00:49:53.420 --> 00:49:54.640]  We're going to take your rights.
[00:49:54.900 --> 00:49:56.421]  We're going to do this, we're going to do that.
[00:49:56.481 --> 00:50:02.042]  The last thing the globalists would want is for any of us to act like we are the globalists.
[00:50:02.222 --> 00:50:03.182]  Here's what we're going to do.
[00:50:03.202 --> 00:50:04.202]  Well, I do that sometimes.
[00:50:04.282 --> 00:50:09.143]  I run around and go, it's good to have open borders.
[00:50:09.423 --> 00:50:11.103]  It's good to have North America Union.
[00:50:11.123 --> 00:50:14.364]  Oh, you about busted my gut in this one clip of you that I've watched where
[00:50:15.174 --> 00:50:30.621]  You're coming, it's after you crashed the Bohemian Grove or whatever it was called, me and my wife and kids were watching this, where you said, and they ride by on their horses looking down, and you're eating a kumquat or a piece of garden, something that you grew.
[00:50:30.641 --> 00:50:31.322]  A turnip.
[00:50:31.602 --> 00:50:35.804]  Yeah, yeah, a turnip, and it's such a, I mean, man, I've watched...
[00:50:38.301 --> 00:50:40.862]  I don't get to laugh much, man, but that was really funny.
[00:50:41.162 --> 00:50:42.363]  But I do it sincerely.
[00:50:42.843 --> 00:50:45.884]  I sincerely act like that I'm part of the globalists.
[00:50:46.225 --> 00:50:47.525]  We're going to take your freedom.
[00:50:47.605 --> 00:50:48.566]  Here's what we're going to do.
[00:50:48.606 --> 00:50:49.266]  Hold on, hold on.
[00:50:49.286 --> 00:50:50.447]  You're actually out doing this.
[00:50:50.507 --> 00:50:52.588]  I want to hear what response you get.
[00:50:54.028 --> 00:50:55.369]  Yeah, reverse psychology.
[00:50:55.689 --> 00:50:56.470]  We'll be right back.
[00:50:56.490 --> 00:50:56.950]  Stay with us.

[00:51:08.171 --> 00:51:10.092]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[00:51:10.452 --> 00:51:18.118]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:18.798 --> 00:51:25.843]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:51:26.243 --> 00:51:33.088]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying,
[00:51:33.624 --> 00:51:37.647]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:51:37.968 --> 00:51:41.490]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:51:41.951 --> 00:51:43.852]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:51:44.193 --> 00:51:48.116]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:55:02.714 --> 00:55:04.115]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:55:29.167 --> 00:55:33.931]  Let's go ahead and go back to Joe, then we'll go to David, Daryl, Luis, and many others.
[00:55:34.612 --> 00:55:35.613]  Finish up what you were saying.
[00:55:35.633 --> 00:55:39.056]  So you go around, Joe, and you act like you're for the New World Order.
[00:55:39.076 --> 00:55:40.417]  What are you, walking to a truck stop?
[00:55:40.457 --> 00:55:41.338]  Are you walking to church?
[00:55:41.378 --> 00:55:42.218]  Describe it for us.
[00:55:42.358 --> 00:55:48.163]  Well, I have a base station a little close to a truck stop, and I know everything there is to know about trucking.
[00:55:48.203 --> 00:55:50.165]  There is a limit to knowledge of trucking.
[00:55:50.846 --> 00:55:52.387]  Anyway, I have a tendency to ramble.
[00:55:52.407 --> 00:55:56.851]  I don't want to ramble, buddy, because I know you're a very busy guy doing all this, and
[00:55:57.378 --> 00:55:59.920]  God bless you, I think, because here's my question.
[00:56:00.701 --> 00:56:01.982]  I know they have think tanks.
[00:56:02.542 --> 00:56:06.025]  Surely they're going to know, just like when the trade singer come down.
[00:56:06.045 --> 00:56:09.288]  Now don't take offense to this, Alex, I'm sure you understand what I mean by this.
[00:56:09.348 --> 00:56:16.373]  When the trade singer came down, they knew before the second plane hit that people's going to have cameras out videotaping this stuff.
[00:56:16.714 --> 00:56:25.981]  They knew that there's people out here that have eyes and have ears and have, you know, video and they're going to see this and they're going to break it down and they're going to figure out it was an inside job.
[00:56:26.758 --> 00:56:30.719]  Why would they make it, number one, so blatantly clear it was an inside job?
[00:56:30.759 --> 00:56:32.260]  You can see the demolition's gone off.
[00:56:32.640 --> 00:56:35.821]  And number two, they know someone's going to complain about this.
[00:56:35.921 --> 00:56:38.562]  Therefore, the biggest complainer, Alex, is you.
[00:56:38.862 --> 00:56:40.423]  You're the biggest complainer out there.
[00:56:40.783 --> 00:56:41.723]  I'm right there with you.
[00:56:41.763 --> 00:56:43.404]  I mean, sincerely, I'm right there with you.
[00:56:43.444 --> 00:56:43.544]  Okay.
[00:56:43.684 --> 00:56:46.945]  You know, I've answered this question many times in different ways.
[00:56:47.025 --> 00:56:47.885]  It's a big question.
[00:56:47.905 --> 00:56:48.966]  It has a long answer.
[00:56:49.546 --> 00:56:51.207]  But the listeners held over to hear it.
[00:56:51.747 --> 00:56:52.667]  I'll answer your question.
[00:56:52.787 --> 00:56:54.948]  But first, answer my question.
[00:56:55.683 --> 00:56:58.725]  You said that you go around sarcastically into these places.
[00:56:58.825 --> 00:56:59.386]  Yeah, they hate me.
[00:56:59.446 --> 00:57:01.547]  They yell at me, shut up.
[00:57:01.627 --> 00:57:07.031]  They say horrible, you know, I mean they use language that I can't use that's customary to truckers.
[00:57:07.131 --> 00:57:09.532]  So you walk in there going, I love world government.
[00:57:09.853 --> 00:57:11.774]  Well, they just tell me shut up and I'm stupid.
[00:57:11.894 --> 00:57:13.735]  I know, but tell me what you're saying.
[00:57:13.775 --> 00:57:14.676]  Give me an image, I mean, you know.
[00:57:15.076 --> 00:57:19.999]  Okay, over the radio I'll say like, yeah, we're taking away your constitutional rights.
[00:57:20.019 --> 00:57:22.081]  I ain't going to tell you people what member
[00:57:22.561 --> 00:57:27.103]  Of the government I am, but I, you know, we do have homes, we do have families, and I'm telling you what's next.
[00:57:27.423 --> 00:57:30.364]  You're going to all be on camera within the next five years.
[00:57:30.644 --> 00:57:34.045]  You won't be able to drive a mile from your house without being on camera.
[00:57:34.245 --> 00:57:35.986]  And I just want you to know we're doing it to you.
[00:57:36.186 --> 00:57:39.287]  And you know why I'm coming right out and telling you we're going to do it to you?
[00:57:39.587 --> 00:57:40.527]  Because it's too late.
[00:57:40.567 --> 00:57:41.948]  There's nothing you can do about it.
[00:57:42.308 --> 00:57:45.909]  Say goodbye to your constitutional rights, you dumbass Americans.
[00:57:46.249 --> 00:57:47.070]  That's what I say.
[00:57:47.110 --> 00:57:48.511]  Step along that line.
[00:57:48.771 --> 00:57:52.773]  I've actually been riding around with friends on a CB doing that before myself.
[00:57:52.954 --> 00:57:59.458]  And then you know, you get cussed out, you get told you're stupid, you get told to shut up, and all this stuff.
[00:57:59.598 --> 00:58:03.801]  And I mean, that is my approach, and I do it very, very sincerely.
[00:58:03.901 --> 00:58:05.322]  I do not laugh about it.
[00:58:06.502 --> 00:58:08.324]  Okay, well listen, I appreciate your call.
[00:58:08.344 --> 00:58:09.264]  Let me answer your question now.
[00:58:09.304 --> 00:58:10.765]  I've got to move on and be fair to everybody.
[00:58:10.785 --> 00:58:12.246]  We've got guests coming up, too.
[00:58:12.266 --> 00:58:15.027]  I'm going to try to cram a few calls in in this next segment.
[00:58:15.348 --> 00:58:17.429]  But if I try to answer your question, I won't be able to.
[00:58:17.449 --> 00:58:20.170]  Again, that's a quandary.
[00:58:23.252 --> 00:58:24.573]  How do you answer that question?
[00:58:24.653 --> 00:58:27.375]  I mean, how do you answer it short and succinct?
[00:58:28.655 --> 00:58:29.276]  Hubris.
[00:58:29.536 --> 00:58:31.497]  The enemy is not all-powerful.
[00:58:31.537 --> 00:58:32.758]  They are not omnipresent.
[00:58:34.016 --> 00:58:35.256]  Well, let me answer when we get back.
[00:58:35.496 --> 00:58:39.098]  Let me try to encapsulate it when we return.
[00:58:41.438 --> 00:58:45.359]  If you would like a copy of this show, come to GCNlive.com and reserve it today.
[00:58:45.680 --> 00:58:46.480]  Or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[00:58:46.500 --> 00:58:47.020]  Big Brother.
[00:58:47.200 --> 00:58:48.080]  Mainstream media.
[00:58:48.100 --> 00:58:49.201]  Government cover-ups.
[00:58:49.221 --> 00:58:53.942]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.278 --> 00:59:05.159]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.179 --> 00:59:09.782]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.022 --> 00:59:14.145]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:16.847 --> 00:59:19.649]  We've got a member of Parliament, Norman Baker, joining us.
[00:59:19.669 --> 00:59:23.551]  He confronted Tony Blair over his Bilderberg Group membership.
[00:59:24.752 --> 00:59:26.253]  That's coming up in the next segment.
[00:59:26.273 --> 00:59:28.134]  We'll have open phones throughout the broadcast today.
[00:59:28.675 --> 00:59:30.056]  Mike Malloy, who got fired
[00:59:30.991 --> 00:59:34.893]  We're speaking out on 9-11 and other important issues.
[00:59:34.913 --> 00:59:43.917]  We'll be joining a former 2020, not former 2020, I'm always thinking of James Bamford who are also lining up for the show, 2020 producer.
[00:59:43.937 --> 00:59:46.978]  A high-level CNN producer.
[00:59:47.919 --> 00:59:48.479]  There we go.
[00:59:49.460 --> 00:59:53.381]  And he'll be coming up in the third hour today.
[00:59:53.401 --> 00:59:56.523]  And I want to go to David and Daryl and
[00:59:57.603 --> 00:59:58.843]  Lois and everybody, we will get to you.
[00:59:58.863 --> 00:59:59.984]  But I've got to answer the question.
[01:00:00.024 --> 01:00:03.965]  It's an important question from the last caller from West Virginia.
[01:00:05.645 --> 01:00:08.626]  And that was, the government and the people that control it are not stupid.
[01:00:08.646 --> 01:00:09.247]  We know they're not.
[01:00:09.267 --> 01:00:10.307]  That's why they're in control.
[01:00:11.187 --> 01:00:17.389]  And so they had to know that when the towers fell, they had to know that people wouldn't notice there were bombs in the buildings.
[01:00:18.109 --> 01:00:20.750]  They had to know that the people were going to wake up.
[01:00:22.010 --> 01:00:23.631]  They had to know there was going to be this response.
[01:00:24.574 --> 01:00:33.600]  I don't think their computer mapping, societal wargaming systems are that sophisticated, and you never know what chance is going to do.
[01:00:35.381 --> 01:00:44.688]  I mean, the most powerful computer in the world cannot calculate how many times you flip a coin heads or tails, what percentage it's going to flip.
[01:00:44.708 --> 01:00:45.988]  It's really never 50-50.
[01:00:47.418 --> 01:00:49.421]  It might be 70-30, it might be 20-80, it might be 49-51.
[01:00:49.441 --> 01:00:54.649]  They can map generalities, they can get the basics of what's going on, they can see trends.
[01:01:02.754 --> 01:01:05.055]  But they blew Kennedy's head off in front of everybody.
[01:01:05.095 --> 01:01:07.755]  I mean, he gets shot in the front and the back of his head blows off.
[01:01:08.255 --> 01:01:11.636]  Police and hundreds of witnesses saw plumes of smoke and guys running away.
[01:01:12.296 --> 01:01:15.197]  You couldn't shoot three shots with that rifle and hit the side of a barn.
[01:01:15.897 --> 01:01:19.818]  The shots were supposedly right through a live oak tree that had all its leaves on it.
[01:01:22.139 --> 01:01:24.640]  And the tree is the same size as it was then.
[01:01:24.660 --> 01:01:26.120]  They keep the whole area the same.
[01:01:27.200 --> 01:01:29.641]  And, you know, that's what happened.
[01:01:30.695 --> 01:01:38.378]  I mean, they did it right out in front of everybody, and they saw how dumbed down the public was, how the public would buy anything, how trusting the public was.
[01:01:38.818 --> 01:01:40.358]  But over time, the public did learn.
[01:01:40.979 --> 01:01:50.282]  You know, it took four or five years for the majority of Americans to learn that Waco was a premeditated butchering, and illegal, and used troops, and the troops set the fires Delta Force did.
[01:01:50.662 --> 01:01:51.662]  That's now come out.
[01:01:52.602 --> 01:01:55.924]  For the first few years, people bought into it, but it didn't take 40 years to expose it.
[01:01:56.364 --> 01:01:57.504]  And it didn't take 40 years of 9-11 either.
[01:01:57.524 --> 01:01:57.624]  Okay?
[01:02:00.518 --> 01:02:04.539]  We got 84% not believing the official story, believing they're being lied to.
[01:02:05.839 --> 01:02:10.820]  We got 84% not liking either branch of the two parties in Congress.
[01:02:12.500 --> 01:02:15.661]  And so they knew there'd be people that said it was an inside job.
[01:02:16.421 --> 01:02:20.801]  But back in 2000, again the alternative media wasn't as big.
[01:02:21.242 --> 01:02:22.682]  They still had a lot of hubris.
[01:02:24.062 --> 01:02:25.122]  I know the think tanks.
[01:02:26.042 --> 01:02:28.883]  Hell, the think tanks told Bush don't go into Iraq with less than 500,000 troops.
[01:02:30.908 --> 01:02:39.954]  But they did it, and of course, the real reason is that they understood something instinctive, and higher level groups understood they wanted to break it up and have chaos.
[01:02:40.154 --> 01:02:43.316]  But even the mainline think tanks, they're not made up of total criminals.
[01:02:44.037 --> 01:02:53.023]  They're made up of imperialists who believe world government's good, but they still, most of them, buy into this lofty reason for it that's really a fraud and a bait.
[01:02:54.719 --> 01:02:58.122]  And so, they're being supplied with a lot of data.
[01:02:58.562 --> 01:03:08.770]  But you see, you've got all the brains who feed the New World Order now, and you certainly had brains hundreds of years ago, and a hundred years ago, that ran the New World Order.
[01:03:09.731 --> 01:03:14.255]  But the inbred people running things today aren't necessarily listening to all the advice.
[01:03:15.576 --> 01:03:22.982]  In fact, Daniel Estillan talked about how the New World Order is going to fail, and he's really an impressive person when you know him in person, when you know him
[01:03:24.253 --> 01:03:25.554]  And get to spend some time with him.
[01:03:26.894 --> 01:03:32.437]  And he said that no one works as hard as David Rockefeller or Henry Kissinger.
[01:03:32.997 --> 01:03:37.119]  And the new crop he's been following around the planet are a bunch of playboys.
[01:03:38.140 --> 01:03:40.120]  But they just don't work 18 hours a day.
[01:03:40.961 --> 01:03:44.482]  You see, we work 18 hours a day and we're going to kick their butts.
[01:03:45.583 --> 01:03:46.303]  God bless you folks.
[01:03:46.323 --> 01:03:47.624]  We'll be right back with our guest.
[01:03:56.463 --> 01:03:56.903]  It's here!
[01:03:57.143 --> 01:04:01.926]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:04:02.286 --> 01:04:09.950]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:04:10.630 --> 01:04:17.673]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:04:18.074 --> 01:04:24.957]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying,
[01:04:25.447 --> 01:04:29.489]  Secret police forger, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:04:29.789 --> 01:04:33.351]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:04:33.771 --> 01:04:35.672]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:04:36.033 --> 01:04:39.935]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:04:53.030 --> 01:04:56.051]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[01:04:56.351 --> 01:05:01.272]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[01:05:01.532 --> 01:05:05.893]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[01:05:06.173 --> 01:05:15.095]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[01:05:15.295 --> 01:05:18.916]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[01:05:19.216 --> 01:05:24.244]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[01:05:24.545 --> 01:05:31.295]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[01:05:31.776 --> 01:05:32.317]  What about you?
[01:05:33.052 --> 01:05:38.415]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[01:05:53.021 --> 01:05:56.602]  Are you looking for a one-stop shop to find all your favorite books and videos?
[01:05:56.862 --> 01:05:57.743]  Look no further!
[01:05:58.023 --> 01:06:00.603]  Northern Voice Bookstore has everything you need.
[01:06:01.024 --> 01:06:09.546]  Hundreds of titles, from self-defense, survival, and financial freedom, to history, politics, conspiracy, and everything you need to know about the New World Order.
[01:06:09.686 --> 01:06:11.387]  You can order everything you need on the web.
[01:06:11.527 --> 01:06:12.067]  I think so.
[01:06:41.527 --> 01:06:44.648]  Until the bottom of the hour, then we'll get into all the other news and take your calls.
[01:06:44.689 --> 01:06:45.909]  We have a really interesting individual.
[01:07:11.756 --> 01:07:35.480]  Norman Baker, and he is a Member of Parliament from Luz, I believe you pronounce it, and he joins us from London today, and he forwarded a question to the Prime Minister's office about his attendance in the past of the Bilderberg Group meeting, and the Prime Minister responded that he has never attended any such meeting.
[01:07:36.345 --> 01:07:38.587]  Of course, I have several books published on the subject.
[01:07:38.667 --> 01:07:39.988]  I have photos of him there.
[01:07:40.929 --> 01:07:42.810]  I have traveled to a Bilderberg Group meeting.
[01:07:42.870 --> 01:07:46.613]  I have been covering it for twelve years on the radio.
[01:07:47.134 --> 01:07:53.519]  And we know that in the early nineties, when he was a nobody, a member of parliament from labor, that he did attend.
[01:07:53.559 --> 01:07:55.220]  We know in 97 he attended.
[01:07:55.240 --> 01:07:58.283]  So it's just a bald-faced lying.
[01:07:58.723 --> 01:08:00.424]  Joining us is Norman Baker.
[01:08:00.484 --> 01:08:01.425]  Sir, thank you for coming on.
[01:08:01.825 --> 01:08:02.346]  My pleasure.
[01:08:03.807 --> 01:08:06.048]  Tell us why you're concerned about Bilderberg.
[01:08:06.068 --> 01:08:08.548]  For those who don't know what it is, give us your take on what it is.
[01:08:09.209 --> 01:08:29.394]  Well, it's the meeting which takes place at least once a year, instigated really after the war, and which sees leading individuals, and potentially the individuals, from different countries, particularly in the, if you might call it the White North, if you like, coming together to meet and discuss future policy.
[01:08:29.435 --> 01:08:30.955]  Now, some say that this is
[01:08:31.940 --> 01:08:32.300]  I don't know.
[01:08:47.165 --> 01:08:48.385]  The reports of these meetings.
[01:08:48.925 --> 01:08:49.526]  Absolutely.
[01:08:49.786 --> 01:08:58.688]  Tell us just a little bit about yourself and then roll into specifically what you asked of Blair and what his response was and what that means to you.
[01:08:59.388 --> 01:09:01.969]  Well I should say that my name, you know, is Norman Baker.
[01:09:01.989 --> 01:09:14.231]  I'm a Liberal Democrat Member of Parliament representing Lewis E. Sussex down in the south of England and my view is that Parliament and society should be more open and accountable than they are.
[01:09:14.732 --> 01:09:16.552]  I'm a great believer in freedom of information
[01:09:17.265 --> 01:09:22.488]  And I think good government follows information being released to the public which they can then judge the government on.
[01:09:22.868 --> 01:09:27.611]  And it's ultimately in the interest of government to have that information in the public domain.
[01:09:28.032 --> 01:09:32.975]  So I spend my time campaigning for open information and therefore for better government.
[01:09:33.095 --> 01:09:41.620]  And my view is that the more open government is, within certain confines of course, then the better the government will behave and perform.
[01:09:43.314 --> 01:09:52.721]  I agree, sir, and we're very thankful for what you and others like you are doing, because we too seek transparency and sunlight into these dark places.
[01:09:53.541 --> 01:10:07.431]  Can you, for the listeners, tell us why you got the idea to confront Blair and then basically how you, via a written request, we've now learned, asked him about the Bilderberg Group and what you think of his response?
[01:10:07.871 --> 01:10:12.253]  Well, I mean, I've regularly asked the Prime Minister's questions and he regularly replies.
[01:10:12.313 --> 01:10:16.514]  I say replies rather than answers because you frequently avoid answering the question.
[01:10:17.235 --> 01:10:24.397]  He's become more and more reticent to providing information as the years go by and more and more reluctant to engage in a democratic process.
[01:10:25.238 --> 01:10:27.799]  I know a lot of people stateside think that Mr Blair is wonderful.
[01:10:28.119 --> 01:10:30.179]  I can tell you over here we don't think he's wonderful.
[01:10:30.239 --> 01:10:33.341]  We think he's passed his sell-by date and ought to be out of office.
[01:10:34.421 --> 01:10:36.882]  I asked him specifically in a couple of written questions
[01:10:37.538 --> 01:10:39.158]  about his attendance at the Bilderberg Group.
[01:10:39.919 --> 01:10:47.161]  He says to me, in his written answer, he's not attended any such meetings, that's his phrase, since 1997.
[01:10:47.661 --> 01:10:48.801]  Well, you tell me he has.
[01:10:49.461 --> 01:10:52.322]  My individual records show he went there in 1998, I think.
[01:10:52.922 --> 01:10:58.784]  So clearly, if we can make that stand up, then that's a matter which I'll raise with the Speaker of the House of Commons, because it clearly would be inaccurate.
[01:10:59.404 --> 01:11:01.825]  You mentioned a moment ago you think you've got photographs and so on.
[01:11:02.445 --> 01:11:05.065]  Please send them to me on my website, and I'll gladly do something with them.
[01:11:05.506 --> 01:11:06.066]  Oh, yes, sir.
[01:11:06.126 --> 01:11:07.186]  In fact, what is your website?
[01:11:08.241 --> 01:11:23.548]  www.normanbaker.org.uk normanbaker.org.uk yeah okay we will send you anything you've got on that we will send you as much information as we can it's not customary for someone once they're prime minister
[01:11:24.768 --> 01:11:34.330]  Or President to go to the Bohemian Grove, or to go to the Skull and Bones Tomb, or to go to the Bilderberg Group meetings, or the Club of Rome or Committee of 300.
[01:11:35.010 --> 01:11:43.652]  Though we know in the past they have done it, and my information is that Blair has snuck into meetings that are held in Europe since then, but we'll have to confirm that.
[01:11:43.692 --> 01:11:50.674]  But to be specific, you're saying in his response, he said, I haven't attended since this date.
[01:11:51.557 --> 01:12:02.406]  Well, the question relates to his time as Prime Minister because legally I can't ask questions about his time before Prime Minister because he's got no responsibility for that in government terms.
[01:12:02.946 --> 01:12:08.711]  So we have to ask about his time in office and his answer is that he's attended no such meetings since he's been Prime Minister.
[01:12:10.793 --> 01:12:17.158]  Now, we've gotten some of the corporate minutes out of the Bilderberg, in fact the BBC a few years ago reported on it.
[01:12:17.856 --> 01:12:19.997]  And the Bilderberg Group released them themselves.
[01:12:20.017 --> 01:12:26.822]  They were quite proud of the fact that they had engineered the European Union, or at least they're taking credit for that.
[01:12:26.862 --> 01:12:32.085]  And we know that when Prince Bernhard the Known Nazi founded it in 1954, that was its first big mission.
[01:12:32.986 --> 01:12:42.052]  Can you speak to the fact that they are now quite open and arrogant about the fact that they are the prime movers or the sires of the EU?
[01:12:43.247 --> 01:12:48.110]  Well, I don't know whether I accept that or not, but I mean anything which is more open has to be welcomed.
[01:12:48.511 --> 01:12:52.613]  The fact that we can now get the list of who's been there, for example, is a step forward.
[01:12:54.094 --> 01:12:58.097]  And obviously I'll be pushing for more accountability on that front rather than less.
[01:13:00.819 --> 01:13:06.342]  But speaking directly, sir, and again we're talking to Norman Baker, a Member of Parliament from Lewes,
[01:13:07.978 --> 01:13:10.439]  They're in England and again we're thankful for the time.
[01:13:10.839 --> 01:13:23.745]  Can you specifically speak to, because I heard you say yes when I mentioned that BBC report a few years ago, can you specifically speak to their open announcement that they were involved in the founding of the EU?
[01:13:25.479 --> 01:13:28.660]  Well, I mean, I don't know whether I can confirm that.
[01:13:28.700 --> 01:13:38.123]  What I can confirm is obviously right from the beginning there was a movement within Europe which thought that a coming together of nations in the European Union was a good idea.
[01:13:38.143 --> 01:13:40.564]  That's a view I share as a matter of fact.
[01:13:42.024 --> 01:13:49.446]  So therefore it's not surprising if there were key people from Europe coming together that that was an idea which would be talked about given that that was common currency at the time.
[01:13:49.967 --> 01:13:51.307]  I happen to think in the world we're in
[01:13:52.159 --> 01:13:54.621]  It's important to have different power blocks.
[01:13:54.801 --> 01:14:06.908]  We needn't be opposing each other, but it's important, for example, at the moment when there's no other superpower rather than the United States, the only one, that the European Union does act in concert where possible and provides a counterbalance.
[01:14:07.949 --> 01:14:12.352]  If we don't have that, then we have one world power, which I think is inherently dangerous.
[01:14:12.392 --> 01:14:15.654]  Sure, you're saying you don't want a unipolar hegemon.
[01:14:16.841 --> 01:14:20.923]  No, I want countries to be independent, but to work together for a common purpose.
[01:14:20.943 --> 01:14:23.605]  And the European Union, if it's properly constructed, should provide that.
[01:14:24.245 --> 01:14:35.031]  Sure, my problem with it is some of the same global financial interests, the oil companies, the banking cartels, aren't controlling the EU like a sock puppet, just like they control the US.
[01:14:35.431 --> 01:14:41.735]  Well, we're in the world we're in, and we have to make the best arrangements that we can legitimately argue for.
[01:14:42.355 --> 01:14:44.356]  And pragmatism always comes into politics.
[01:14:44.596 --> 01:14:45.457]  There's a danger for
[01:14:46.141 --> 01:14:47.042]  The House of Lords also, I saw on the news,
[01:15:07.287 --> 01:15:16.771]  I saw in a press report the House of Lords, not just the House of Commons, has come out and asked a question of Tony Blair about his involvement with the Bilderberg Group.
[01:15:17.871 --> 01:15:25.854]  Well, I haven't seen that, but I wouldn't be entirely surprised because the House of Lords is still independent from the Prime Minister, so we will see that.
[01:15:26.114 --> 01:15:32.737]  I mean, can I say I think the Prime Minister's accountability goes much further than simply the issue of whether he attended these particular meetings or not.
[01:15:33.177 --> 01:15:36.018]  I mean, over here there are many people who feel that the Prime Minister acts
[01:15:37.144 --> 01:15:43.587]  Simply as a poodle for your president, and isn't prepared to have an independent foreign policy for this country.
[01:15:44.047 --> 01:15:49.890]  Now it may well be that on occasions UK and US foreign interests coincide, but on many other occasions they don't.
[01:15:50.490 --> 01:15:57.874]  And I have to tell you that in my view, Mr. Blair has done immense damage to this country's reputation abroad by his involvement in the Iraq War.
[01:15:58.254 --> 01:16:04.117]  Oh, I heartily agree, and I would tell you that you said it earlier that Blair's popular over here,
[01:16:04.907 --> 01:16:08.991]  Bush has a 30% approval rating over here, and Blair has one that's even lower.
[01:16:09.011 --> 01:16:11.754]  So the American people do not buy into this.
[01:16:12.214 --> 01:16:18.861]  Well, I'm pleased to hear it, because frankly, that was, in international law terms, an illegal war.
[01:16:19.462 --> 01:16:22.164]  If it was designed to stop terrorism, it would have the exact opposite effect.
[01:16:22.184 --> 01:16:24.407]  There are now far more terrorists in Iraq than when
[01:16:25.951 --> 01:16:27.512]  Oh, I agree with you.
[01:16:27.532 --> 01:16:35.836]  I mean, the P-2-O-G Pentagon documents said they actually wanted to create terrorism to widen the war.
[01:16:35.876 --> 01:16:41.759]  I mean, the defense contractors, they have an incentive to want to stay there decades, not a year.
[01:16:42.400 --> 01:16:46.782]  So the big defense hardware makers, they actually want an endless war.
[01:16:47.691 --> 01:16:48.272]  Well, of course.
[01:16:48.332 --> 01:16:51.274]  I mean, you have to look at, you know, where's the money?
[01:16:52.335 --> 01:16:53.376]  That's always a question, isn't it?
[01:16:53.437 --> 01:16:55.278]  Who gets the financial benefit?
[01:16:55.779 --> 01:17:06.489]  And undoubtedly, I think from looking at it objectively, in your country and indeed in mine, the people who do well out of conflict are the arms industry.
[01:17:07.662 --> 01:17:09.223]  And defense manufacturers.
[01:17:09.263 --> 01:17:10.604]  I mean, they're the ones who do well.
[01:17:10.624 --> 01:17:11.244]  I agree.
[01:17:11.285 --> 01:17:15.567]  It also seems there's more interest now in Bilderberg, more coverage in the press.
[01:17:15.587 --> 01:17:16.928]  In the past, they were very secretive.
[01:17:17.248 --> 01:17:21.250]  Now they've been exposed, so they're being a little bit more transparent.
[01:17:21.751 --> 01:17:24.652]  Why do you think people are more interested, more informed about Bilderberg now?
[01:17:25.673 --> 01:17:32.657]  Well, I think people are generally keener to understand how society works, and they're no longer prepared to take on trust.
[01:17:33.197 --> 01:17:35.559]  The old statements from government
[01:17:36.541 --> 01:17:42.003]  Unquestioningly, they want to analyze matters for themselves and get to the truth.
[01:17:42.023 --> 01:17:45.084]  There's no longer an assumption that the government tells you something.
[01:17:45.104 --> 01:17:45.784]  You can believe it.
[01:17:45.804 --> 01:17:50.426]  Now, that's entirely healthy in democracy, but it also reflects a cynicism.
[01:17:50.446 --> 01:17:57.628]  Well, that's a good point because the British and the people of the US and Europe, you know, 30, 40 years ago, were extremely trusting.
[01:17:58.088 --> 01:18:00.029]  Now, they're not as trusting and that's healthy.
[01:18:00.549 --> 01:18:01.069]  Well, they're not.
[01:18:01.109 --> 01:18:05.571]  I mean, I've just been busy exposing an issue over here relating to
[01:18:06.697 --> 01:18:17.764]  A flight which took off from the UK in 1990, involving 400 passengers and crew, which landed in Kuwait when the Iraqis were already surrounding the airport.
[01:18:18.144 --> 01:18:23.988]  Now the Prime Minister at the time, Mrs Thatcher, told the House of Commons that the Iraqis weren't invading or anywhere near.
[01:18:24.428 --> 01:18:30.832]  It's now quite clear that plane touched down in order to allow Special Forces operatives off the plane to do whatever they have to do in Kuwait.
[01:18:30.872 --> 01:18:35.815]  Now, that may or may not be legitimate, but the fact of the matter was the House of Commons was not told the truth about the matter.
[01:18:38.112 --> 01:18:38.612]  Absolutely.
[01:18:38.632 --> 01:18:44.155]  You've also been talking about Dr. David Kelly's murder, the evidence of a cover-up.
[01:18:44.175 --> 01:18:49.117]  I want to get your response to that, man, and what you've been doing to expose that when we get back, sir.
[01:18:49.537 --> 01:18:50.078]  Stay with us.
[01:18:51.038 --> 01:18:58.381]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson, here for the 2007 Red Book.
[01:19:00.692 --> 01:19:05.515]  The commodity markets like gold, silver, copper, aluminum and oil have exploded over the last year.
[01:19:05.715 --> 01:19:08.457]  This is a glaring testimony of how quickly the U.S.
[01:19:08.497 --> 01:19:09.617]  dollar can be devalued.
[01:19:10.958 --> 01:19:15.561]  Many have turned to precious metals to provide a safe haven while increasing the potential profits.
[01:19:16.481 --> 01:19:23.746]  Though accumulating precious metals has been a proven method for the storage of wealth, it is important that you understand the market you are getting into.

[01:21:01.925 --> 01:21:02.545]  Yeah.
[01:21:02.926 --> 01:21:04.347]  Honey, is there something wrong?
[01:21:04.707 --> 01:21:08.110]  Yeah, I just realized we forgot to pack the travel berkey system.
[01:21:08.571 --> 01:21:10.072]  I can't drink this cabin water.
[01:21:10.512 --> 01:21:12.214]  And what am I going to do when I'm out on the lake?
[01:21:12.614 --> 01:21:14.376]  Now the whole vacation is ruined.
[01:21:14.576 --> 01:21:15.417]  Honey, cheer up!

[01:21:56.809 --> 01:22:09.094]  Did you know that those seeking to destroy America and merge us into an all-powerful, one-world government said that they support every movement to centralize all authority in Washington, D.C., and therefore bypass the state governments?
[01:22:09.975 --> 01:22:13.657]  That way they will have only one battle to win, Washington D.C.
[01:22:14.518 --> 01:22:20.681]  Have we witnessed the accumulation of power in Washington and bypassing the states over the last 50 years?

[01:23:00.653 --> 01:23:03.496]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:23:05.458 --> 01:23:10.302]  Norman Baker, Member of Parliament from Lewes, joins us from the UK right now.
[01:23:10.322 --> 01:23:13.725]  Just one more question about the Bilderberg Group.
[01:23:15.501 --> 01:23:20.104]  Mr. Baker, I remember five years ago, six years ago, being attacked by the New York Times.
[01:23:20.164 --> 01:23:24.906]  It said, Alex Jones believes in something called the Bilderberg Group.
[01:23:25.407 --> 01:23:27.468]  I mean, it was never in the news.
[01:23:28.128 --> 01:23:32.350]  Now, when they had their meeting in Canada, it was on every front page of every major paper.
[01:23:32.731 --> 01:23:36.833]  The Queen of the Netherlands, the Rockefellers, you know, the governors.
[01:23:37.433 --> 01:23:39.095]  Hillary snuck into the meeting.
[01:23:39.595 --> 01:23:44.359]  I mean they were all there and they seem to be very upset now that they're being revealed.
[01:23:45.320 --> 01:23:51.746]  I mean is this scary when you've got world elite meeting obviously trying to combine their power together to get even greater power?
[01:23:52.266 --> 01:24:04.337]  Well I think what's scary is the fact that the media generally will not report events which many of us think are media worthy until someone else in the media reports them and we end up with a
[01:24:05.006 --> 01:24:05.506]  Yes, it does, yes.
[01:24:28.126 --> 01:24:30.988]  Boy, that's kind of influence peddling.
[01:24:31.569 --> 01:24:35.812]  Dr. David Kelly, witnesses said there were men in black uniforms standing around his body that ran off.
[01:24:36.493 --> 01:24:39.375]  The wrists were slit and there wasn't hardly any blood at the scene.
[01:24:39.415 --> 01:24:40.716]  The pills were undigested.
[01:24:41.037 --> 01:24:45.220]  He told friends and colleagues that I'm going to be murdered or I'm going to be found dead in the woods.
[01:24:46.001 --> 01:24:51.485]  And it's kind of like Princess Diana saying, Charles, he's going to kill me and put me in a car wreck.
[01:24:51.505 --> 01:24:52.466]  And then it happens to her.
[01:24:53.167 --> 01:24:56.049]  What, from your research, sir, really happened with Dr. David Kelly?
[01:24:56.818 --> 01:24:57.759]  Well, let me put it this way.
[01:24:58.099 --> 01:25:09.146]  I started off by examining the evidence and I've concluded, beyond reasonable doubt, to use that legal test in the UK at least, that this could not have been suicide.
[01:25:09.666 --> 01:25:15.149]  It could not have been suicide because the medical evidence simply doesn't support it.
[01:25:15.349 --> 01:25:20.873]  There's no way Dr Kelly could have died from the alleged cause ascribed to his death.
[01:25:21.473 --> 01:25:25.616]  Furthermore, it's quite clear from looking at his state of mind and talking to those near him,
[01:25:26.198 --> 01:25:27.639]  That he had not sought to commit suicide.
[01:25:27.679 --> 01:25:28.920]  Indeed, it was against his faith.
[01:25:28.940 --> 01:25:30.761]  He was a member of the Baha'i faith.
[01:25:31.441 --> 01:25:39.086]  And indeed, on the morning when he was, um, he went missing, he, uh, was so confident about the future, he'd actually booked a flight to Iraq for the following week.
[01:25:39.626 --> 01:25:42.448]  So there's no question in my mind that, uh, this was not suicide.
[01:25:44.443 --> 01:25:46.044]  Now, clearly they killed him.
[01:25:46.164 --> 01:25:53.569]  I mean, the scientific evidence, national coroners and top scientists, top doctors have gone public saying he was clearly murdered.
[01:25:53.629 --> 01:25:58.552]  Coroners... I mean, it's an open and shut case.
[01:25:58.592 --> 01:25:58.952]  Just like...
[01:25:59.805 --> 01:26:05.387]  We had, you know, the guy writing the stories about the CIA drug deal and getting his shot twice in the head and they claim it's a suicide.
[01:26:05.908 --> 01:26:07.889]  Who do you think, what interest then, would kill him?
[01:26:07.929 --> 01:26:12.971]  Would it be for running the bio-weapons lab or would it be for blowing the whistle about there not being any WMDs?
[01:26:13.391 --> 01:26:15.412]  Well, forgive me for being a little coy.
[01:26:15.492 --> 01:26:24.035]  I mean, there are a number of possibilities and it's part of my work, my inquiry, which has been going on for three or four months, to look into the various possibilities.
[01:26:24.576 --> 01:26:27.957]  I published an article, a very long article, in one of our
[01:26:28.504 --> 01:26:37.795]  Sunday newspapers here which again you can find on my website www.normanbaker.org.uk which sets out in 4,000 words where I got to that particular point.
[01:26:38.556 --> 01:26:44.442]  Since then I've had a number of leads given to me by those who might be thought to know something.
[01:26:45.183 --> 01:26:48.347]  Those are being followed now and as and when I'm able to reveal
[01:26:48.959 --> 01:26:50.039]  The truth, I will do so.
[01:26:50.059 --> 01:26:55.042]  I hope you'll understand that I don't wish to adversely affect my inquiries.
[01:26:55.102 --> 01:26:57.723]  No, I totally understand you're involved in an investigation.
[01:26:57.983 --> 01:26:59.243]  Are you worried about your safety?
[01:27:00.004 --> 01:27:07.206]  Well, my judgment is that the safest thing for me to do is to make as much noise as possible and be as public as possible about this matter.
[01:27:07.827 --> 01:27:10.308]  And that's what I'm doing both on your show and elsewhere.
[01:27:10.328 --> 01:27:11.188]  I agree with you.
[01:27:11.208 --> 01:27:14.049]  Do you think it's dangerous that I'm making a film about Bilderberg?
[01:27:15.970 --> 01:27:17.571]  Not for what you're telling, but are you doing it?
[01:27:17.871 --> 01:27:17.991]  No.
[01:27:18.824 --> 01:27:27.033]  But it depends what you find out, I suppose, because, you know, we have in England, or in London, something called Speaker's Corner, where you can stand up and make speeches, no matter who you are and what you want to speak about.
[01:27:27.814 --> 01:27:33.660]  I always take the view with that, that you can say what you want, provided you don't start changing things, in which case you would make it illegal.
[01:27:34.140 --> 01:27:37.684]  As long as you're not changing anything, or they'll let you carry on, and that's called democracy.
[01:27:39.165 --> 01:27:39.925]  Absolutely.
[01:27:39.985 --> 01:27:46.587]  In fact, we were getting a tour of London and the lady in the big bus said, you can go speak over there as long as it's not against the Queen.
[01:27:46.927 --> 01:27:48.347]  If you do, you'll be arrested.
[01:27:49.247 --> 01:27:52.048]  Well, I mean, I'm not quite sure it's as straightforward as that.
[01:27:52.088 --> 01:27:55.009]  I mean, I regularly criticize the Royal Family for their finances.
[01:27:55.029 --> 01:27:58.150]  Indeed, I was on British television earlier on today doing that very thing.
[01:27:58.230 --> 01:28:00.290]  So it's perfectly possible to do that.
[01:28:01.870 --> 01:28:04.371]  But the question is whether or not when you start really threatening
[01:28:05.003 --> 01:28:13.788]  Those who are in major positions of power in society, whether or not, when you start damaging them, that is then put a stop to in some way.
[01:28:14.408 --> 01:28:16.790]  I wonder what Kelly was doing that was damaging them?
[01:28:17.910 --> 01:28:27.936]  Well, there are a number, as I say, there are a number of possibilities relating no doubt to his experience in Iraq, to his knowledge of WMD and so on, and other sorts of things which I'm investigating.
[01:28:27.976 --> 01:28:33.799]  He's also, bear in mind, someone who was causing some distress to the government as a consequence of the revelations he was making about
[01:28:34.335 --> 01:28:39.539]  The dodgy dossier which said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction when of course he had no such thing.
[01:28:39.559 --> 01:28:39.799]  Exactly.
[01:28:39.819 --> 01:28:40.779]  Sir, thank you for joining us.
[01:28:40.819 --> 01:28:41.700]  Go vote.
[01:28:43.741 --> 01:28:44.642]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.142 --> 01:28:46.723]  The empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.664 --> 01:28:50.326]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:54.304 --> 01:28:56.666]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here with an important question.
[01:28:56.906 --> 01:28:58.948]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[01:28:59.088 --> 01:29:06.133]  I mean real hard to find all natural pure soap that contains no dyes, perfumes, deodorants, detergents, or other dangerous toxins.
[01:29:06.393 --> 01:29:14.960]  The Calvin Pure Soap Company, for the past 57 years, has been making triple concentrated pure soaps exclusively for healthcare professionals and hospitals.
[01:29:15.300 --> 01:29:19.984]  Now for the first time, Calvin Pure Soap is available factory direct to you and your family.
[01:29:20.124 --> 01:29:26.828]  That's great news because Calvin Pure Soap is made from all natural ingredients, is earth friendly, and completely environmentally safe.

[01:29:53.638 --> 01:29:58.721]  Black Berkey purification elements are more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[01:29:58.781 --> 01:30:06.084]  These awesome elements are used in Berkey purification systems and they can also be used to upgrade most other gravity filtration systems.
[01:30:06.224 --> 01:30:16.850]  They can purify raw, untreated water by removing pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, trihalomethanes, and chemicals such as chlorine, atrazine, styrene, and MTBE.
[01:30:17.070 --> 01:30:21.632]  These elements also reduce unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[01:30:21.892 --> 01:30:26.877]  Unbelievably, they even remove small micro-particulate from water like food coloring particles.
[01:30:27.097 --> 01:30:30.040]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:30:30.260 --> 01:30:40.009]  Moreover, because they are recleanable, black berkey elements are more economical than the standard disposable elements, providing fresh, pure water for less than two cents per gallon.
[01:30:40.149 --> 01:30:45.670]  Get a two-pack for only $99 or a four-pack for only $188 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[01:30:54.132 --> 01:30:56.632]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network.
[01:30:56.732 --> 01:30:59.093]  I have an urgent message for all of our listeners.
[01:30:59.173 --> 01:31:06.234]  The mass media keeps telling us that we are the richest, most powerful economy in the world, quote-unquote.
[01:31:06.834 --> 01:31:08.995]  If this is true, why can't we pay our bills?
[01:31:09.773 --> 01:31:13.316]  Why is the United States the world's largest debtor nation?
[01:31:13.856 --> 01:31:17.999]  The truth is that we are in the worst debt bubble in our nation's history.
[01:31:18.579 --> 01:31:21.561]  When the bubble bursts, will you be able to feed your family?
[01:31:22.522 --> 01:31:25.444]  When the inevitable crash occurs, will you be ready?
[01:31:26.184 --> 01:31:28.626]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.
[01:31:28.666 --> 01:31:30.707]  That's 1-888-892-6238 for the following two free reports.
[01:31:39.802 --> 01:31:40.083]  U.S.
[01:31:40.163 --> 01:31:43.068]  debt bubble, red alert, and real estate crash.
[01:31:44.050 --> 01:31:51.905]  Call 888-8XANADU, that's 888-8XANADU, and ask for George.
[01:32:21.478 --> 01:32:22.078]  Welcome back.
[01:32:22.118 --> 01:32:23.479]  Let's go right into your calls.
[01:32:23.499 --> 01:32:25.440]  Then I'm going to get into Iran condemns U.S.
[01:32:25.480 --> 01:32:28.261]  Gulf War exercise and several other audio clips.
[01:32:29.062 --> 01:32:31.303]  David in Minnesota, thanks for holding her on the air.
[01:32:31.343 --> 01:32:31.703]  Go ahead.
[01:32:32.654 --> 01:32:33.714]  Hey Alex, how's it going?
[01:32:33.854 --> 01:32:35.875]  You need a show in Minnesota, seriously.
[01:32:35.975 --> 01:32:37.655]  Like, on the air, on the radio station.
[01:32:37.695 --> 01:32:44.656]  But anyway... Yeah, we don't have an affiliate in Minnesota, even though the network is based right outside of Minneapolis, St.
[01:32:44.696 --> 01:32:44.937]  Paul.
[01:32:45.777 --> 01:32:46.277]  You need to do it.
[01:32:46.577 --> 01:32:48.057]  We need more people to open their eyes here.
[01:32:48.157 --> 01:32:56.779]  But, I mean, I called to ask you about how George Bush is flip-flopping and how I think we need to turn their tactics on them and start telling them how they're flip-flopping, get them in the media.
[01:32:57.642 --> 01:33:07.969]  I mean, we all know the media is, like, controlled by pretty much the same people, but, I mean, I've been sitting here for the last hour thinking about this, about, you know, I think I want to say to you, first on Colin, but, what I want to know is, I mean, what point do you think people are right now?
[01:33:07.989 --> 01:33:19.798]  I mean, what point do you think it's going to take people to stop, put their foot down, and say, you know, enough is enough, we're going to do something about this, and hold, you know, Democrats accountable, to, like, make them hold Republicans accountable, and kind of get them out of office?
[01:33:19.858 --> 01:33:24.141]  I mean, me and my friends are, like, trying to decide, like, what to do here, why we should, like,
[01:33:24.625 --> 01:33:27.567]  Take a lot of money, buy some gold, leave the country, go to Canada or something.
[01:33:28.448 --> 01:33:31.150]  The problem is, Canada is a big police state too.
[01:33:31.210 --> 01:33:34.413]  In fact, in some facets, in some respects, even worse.
[01:33:35.494 --> 01:33:35.974]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:33:36.054 --> 01:33:38.176]  I mean, I don't get any news out of Canada or Mexico.
[01:33:38.236 --> 01:33:39.557]  I mean, I live right next to Canada.
[01:33:39.577 --> 01:33:40.198]  You know what I mean?
[01:33:40.698 --> 01:33:42.920]  You need to start telling us about Russia up there.
[01:33:43.080 --> 01:33:44.061]  It's pretty bad.
[01:33:44.241 --> 01:33:46.843]  Yeah, the people are real nice, but their government is movie bad.
[01:33:48.314 --> 01:34:02.039]  So, I mean, at what point do you think, I mean, what can we tell people to start doing in, like, almost a non-violent way to start protesting this and start making waves and start letting the government know that we are not going to sit here and let them take away all our civil liberties and let them just run over our whole lives?
[01:34:02.319 --> 01:34:03.660]  I mean, what do we need to do?
[01:34:03.680 --> 01:34:04.860]  I mean, what do we need to tell people?
[01:34:04.880 --> 01:34:07.841]  What do we need to teach people to kind of get people to waken up?
[01:34:08.142 --> 01:34:08.842]  Sure, sure.
[01:34:08.962 --> 01:34:11.903]  Is that your only question or is there more?
[01:34:12.543 --> 01:34:13.824]  That's pretty much good.
[01:34:14.044 --> 01:34:16.985]  I'm thinking if you could find some way to help me help my friends
[01:34:17.512 --> 01:34:17.952]  I don't know.
[01:34:41.818 --> 01:34:43.279]  Way of an analogy.
[01:34:43.680 --> 01:34:51.126]  When you step in the Brazilian water ant, which is the fire ant that got here in the 40's in Louisiana and Texas, brought in in lumber.
[01:34:52.847 --> 01:34:55.269]  When you step in their nest, they all climb up you.
[01:34:55.289 --> 01:35:00.053]  And then they release a pheromone enzyme smell.
[01:35:01.254 --> 01:35:03.836]  And within a second, they all sting you at the same time.
[01:35:03.916 --> 01:35:05.418]  It's a hunting mechanism.
[01:35:05.798 --> 01:35:07.820]  Because if one of them stings you, it's not going to hurt you.
[01:35:08.900 --> 01:35:09.741]  And it doesn't feel good.
[01:35:09.781 --> 01:35:10.762]  But I mean, it can kill you.
[01:35:11.460 --> 01:35:13.101]  Babies get killed all the time.
[01:35:13.141 --> 01:35:14.122]  Dogs get killed.
[01:35:14.723 --> 01:35:21.588]  In some areas there's no quail or dove or other birds that nest near the ground because the fire ants even go up trees.
[01:35:26.372 --> 01:35:32.717]  They kill many other species of lizards.
[01:35:33.017 --> 01:35:34.058]  They decimate everything.
[01:35:35.319 --> 01:35:39.262]  And I don't know why, I just went off into a fire ant analogy, but we're like fire ants.
[01:35:40.373 --> 01:35:43.776]  And each one of us by ourselves can't do a lot.
[01:35:43.796 --> 01:36:00.010]  I mean, some of us can, but most of us, we have this imprinted image from Hollywood and the culture that it's got to be some Herculean archetype who goes out single-handedly and slaughters 500 monsters on the Plain of Gobblegoo.
[01:36:01.545 --> 01:36:03.286]  And that's not how this really works.
[01:36:03.426 --> 01:36:14.332]  There's not going to be some Arnold Schwarzenegger archetype who goes in and kills 500 bad guys in a warehouse with his handheld railgun.
[01:36:16.053 --> 01:36:17.874]  That's just not going to happen in the real world.
[01:36:19.175 --> 01:36:29.541]  But individually, all of us, not waiting for orders from headquarters, but going out and starting websites, starting newsletters just in your neighborhood.
[01:36:30.922 --> 01:36:34.344]  Calling into radio talk shows, getting your own local radio talk show.
[01:36:34.364 --> 01:36:36.645]  I don't care, we have to pay for the time on the weekend to start off.
[01:36:37.426 --> 01:36:41.828]  Whatever you have to do, access television, making films, making short films.
[01:36:41.868 --> 01:36:45.990]  You can go get all the 9-11 films that are out there, make your own little short films, put them on the web.
[01:36:48.032 --> 01:36:54.635]  It's the mere action of, we're all these fire ants on the ground and we're all talking about what should we do.
[01:36:55.055 --> 01:36:58.077]  We're all awake, we're all angry, somebody stepped on our nest.
[01:36:58.846 --> 01:37:03.988]  Instead of talking about some big master plan, just start climbing up the legs.
[01:37:05.009 --> 01:37:08.270]  And we have started doing that, and we're now all over the New World Order's body.
[01:37:08.870 --> 01:37:09.531]  Hundreds of us.
[01:37:09.571 --> 01:37:11.472]  We need thousands more to climb up.
[01:37:11.992 --> 01:37:14.313]  And then just start stinging.
[01:37:14.333 --> 01:37:15.653]  And you'll know when the stinging starts.
[01:37:15.693 --> 01:37:16.234]  You'll see it.
[01:37:16.874 --> 01:37:20.095]  And it's going to be when the enemy makes even bigger, more overt moves.
[01:37:20.916 --> 01:37:22.977]  They're going to shoot kids in the back.
[01:37:22.997 --> 01:37:25.078]  They're going to shoot protesters.
[01:37:25.898 --> 01:37:28.039]  Local torture is going to come out in your news.
[01:37:28.829 --> 01:37:34.974]  News, you know, of the mayor and your town being involved in kiddie porn will come out.
[01:37:35.014 --> 01:37:41.340]  Just more and more of this is going to come out, because they are so criminal, there is so much hubris, they can't help themselves.
[01:37:42.160 --> 01:37:46.163]  And psychopaths and criminals want to get caught, so they're going to get more and more reckless.
[01:37:47.865 --> 01:37:53.890]  And so, there'll be that domino effect.
[01:37:55.180 --> 01:37:57.101]  Don't worry, this thing's coming down.
[01:37:57.561 --> 01:38:11.045]  For all their high technology, and all their sociology, and all the psychology, and all the testing they've done, all the incrementalism they've done, and they've engineered us to be even more decadent and mindless than we normally are.
[01:38:11.065 --> 01:38:16.667]  Humans certainly have a lot of bad traits, a lot of good ones too, but they play to all the weaknesses.
[01:38:18.828 --> 01:38:19.888]  That's going to fall apart.
[01:38:21.748 --> 01:38:26.813]  As the rubber meets the road, as more and more of the New World Order system comes into its own.
[01:38:29.175 --> 01:38:30.677]  And so really it's an attitude.
[01:38:30.737 --> 01:38:42.348]  You want to defeat the New World Order, have an attitude of strength, an attitude of honor, an attitude of a willingness to fight if you need to.
[01:38:43.306 --> 01:38:50.853]  I mean, don't run around shooting your mouth off about how you're going to go out and do something violent like the provocateurs do, and their millions.
[01:38:51.554 --> 01:38:53.095]  I mean, steal yourself.
[01:38:54.436 --> 01:38:55.337]  Harden yourself.
[01:38:55.397 --> 01:38:55.998]  Be ready.
[01:38:56.458 --> 01:39:00.082]  Think about what you're going to need to do if it ever comes to that point.
[01:39:00.582 --> 01:39:02.204]  Think about what you're going to do.
[01:39:03.305 --> 01:39:08.950]  Think about what you can do now, though, instead of just hiding in a bunker about getting out and waking people up.
[01:39:12.358 --> 01:39:16.741]  And the most important thing you can do is don't fight with your girlfriend.
[01:39:17.622 --> 01:39:22.145]  CIA programs in the culture admittedly try to turn men against women, women against men.
[01:39:22.165 --> 01:39:28.190]  They try to turn race against race and all the human race, group against group.
[01:39:28.390 --> 01:39:31.012]  Don't feel like you've got to have the latest DVD player.
[01:39:31.032 --> 01:39:32.973]  Don't feel like you've got to have the latest newest truck.
[01:39:33.714 --> 01:39:37.737]  Don't feel like you have to go into debt to have these signets, these symbols of success.
[01:39:38.337 --> 01:39:40.619]  Which really mean nothing and won't bring you happiness.
[01:39:40.839 --> 01:39:42.861]  And I'm not saying nice things are bad.
[01:39:42.941 --> 01:39:48.226]  It's that if that's your God, if you're feeling insecure for not having those, that's sick.
[01:39:50.969 --> 01:39:52.030]  You know, get focused.
[01:39:52.651 --> 01:39:57.055]  The most valuable thing you can have is friends, communities, people you trust.
[01:39:59.139 --> 01:40:10.887]  And once you've got that, then you need to educate yourself on the New World Order, on their operations, on what they're doing, so you can be a teacher in the future if the enemy shuts down the web and goes to state-run media.
[01:40:10.947 --> 01:40:11.867]  I mean, it could come to that.
[01:40:12.328 --> 01:40:14.189]  You need to be a teacher, a resistor.
[01:40:14.809 --> 01:40:19.152]  You need to be a sleeper cell for freedom, a lone wolf leader.
[01:40:19.844 --> 01:40:20.585]  In your area.
[01:40:21.105 --> 01:40:24.688]  This fight will go on no matter how many battles, no matter how bad it gets.
[01:40:25.148 --> 01:40:26.830]  We are never going to stop because we can't.
[01:40:27.290 --> 01:40:29.812]  Stopping means extermination of 90% of us.
[01:40:30.372 --> 01:40:32.114]  That's the official numbers, the official plan.
[01:40:33.635 --> 01:40:47.886]  And so when you realize how big the cost is, you need to just commit yourself for the duration of your life to this quest to defend liberty, defend the Republic, and stand up against the dehumanizing forces
[01:40:48.670 --> 01:40:49.710]  Of the New World Order.
[01:40:51.851 --> 01:40:56.173]  And, you know, you talk about, well, how do we make the Democrats enforce on the Republicans?
[01:40:56.193 --> 01:40:57.513]  How do we make them punish them?
[01:40:58.553 --> 01:41:02.255]  The Democrats aren't going to do that, because a lot of them are very corrupt and compromised.
[01:41:02.935 --> 01:41:07.696]  And so they know when Republicans are back in office, they don't want the Republicans coming after them.
[01:41:08.257 --> 01:41:11.218]  That's why George Bush said, no, no investigation of Bill Clinton.
[01:41:11.738 --> 01:41:17.960]  And, you know, pardoning cocaine dealers in the White House, and communist Chinese generals in the Commerce Department.
[01:41:22.685 --> 01:41:31.007]  In fact, you don't move up from mayor to state senator to federal congressman unless you've taken bribes, unless you've been on the payroll.
[01:41:32.067 --> 01:41:38.489]  And you don't get up to committee chairman level unless you like ten-year-old girls and ten-year-old boys.
[01:41:38.729 --> 01:41:40.910]  I mean, it's just, they let you have a choice.
[01:41:41.150 --> 01:41:42.710]  Do you like boys or do you like girls?
[01:41:43.410 --> 01:41:45.431]  And basically it's, hey, you want to go to the next level?
[01:41:45.971 --> 01:41:46.811]  This is how it works.
[01:41:47.391 --> 01:41:48.311]  Like eyes wide shut.
[01:41:49.032 --> 01:41:49.812]  But it's even sicker.
[01:41:51.736 --> 01:41:52.917]  Grown women most the time.
[01:41:53.117 --> 01:41:54.859]  That's passe.
[01:41:55.419 --> 01:41:57.441]  That's like a bologna sandwich to these people.
[01:41:57.501 --> 01:42:00.884]  They want something different, something special, something sick.
[01:42:02.125 --> 01:42:06.488]  And so they go to these big mansions, and man, they got the little kids there for them.
[01:42:07.569 --> 01:42:12.373]  And so, I mean, first off, you've got to really realize how evil the enemy is, you see.
[01:42:12.653 --> 01:42:16.657]  You've got to quit judging the world according to your moral compass.
[01:42:18.064 --> 01:42:19.604]  Because a lot of us are corrupt.
[01:42:19.624 --> 01:42:20.664]  A lot of us have problems.
[01:42:21.165 --> 01:42:22.685]  All of us are fallen.
[01:42:23.905 --> 01:42:26.846]  We're a pretty despicable creature.
[01:42:28.406 --> 01:42:32.227]  But we're also wonderful creatures that build beautiful things and have wonderful minds.
[01:42:33.147 --> 01:42:36.287]  But for the highs that we have, we also have lows that are just as low.
[01:42:36.307 --> 01:42:45.869]  I get guilty if I'm rude to my neighbor.
[01:42:46.852 --> 01:42:56.199]  I get guilty if somebody in my family says something a little rude to me and I overreact and I'm pretty aggressive.
[01:42:59.602 --> 01:43:03.745]  Folks, I feel bad if I don't open the door for somebody.
[01:43:05.046 --> 01:43:12.551]  Again, that's really a tribal sense of you want to take care of everybody around you and really at the core it's a healthy
[01:43:18.038 --> 01:43:23.603]  I don't want to say greediness, but it's a healthy selfishness.
[01:43:24.283 --> 01:43:25.404]  Everyone, that makes no sense.
[01:43:25.524 --> 01:43:28.667]  You selfishly want to open the door for people.
[01:43:29.327 --> 01:43:32.150]  You selfishly want to help get people out of a burning house.
[01:43:33.131 --> 01:43:46.922]  You selfishly want to jump out of a car when you see a couple guys mugging some woman and you want to break their noses and cram their, break their jaw and cram their teeth down their throats and stomp them.
[01:43:47.705 --> 01:43:51.106]  You selfishly want to fight the New World Order even if they kill you.
[01:43:51.547 --> 01:43:52.467]  Yes, it's selfish.
[01:43:53.687 --> 01:43:55.108]  But it's a healthy selfishness.
[01:43:55.708 --> 01:44:04.312]  Instinctively, in my ingrained core, I see everybody as members of my tribe.
[01:44:05.792 --> 01:44:08.233]  Okay, I'm just like a dog or something.
[01:44:08.313 --> 01:44:12.735]  I mean, if I'm around people and they're in my pack, I want to take care of them.
[01:44:14.449 --> 01:44:20.011]  And that's selfishness, folks, because when you have that healthy attitude, they're going to be taking care of you, too.
[01:44:21.172 --> 01:44:24.773]  You see, it's camaraderie, it's being on a team, it's being part of a group.
[01:44:26.594 --> 01:44:31.976]  And so, opening doors for people and helping little old ladies across the street, it's not that you're some
[01:44:34.480 --> 01:44:35.241]  Some sap!
[01:44:35.501 --> 01:44:37.402]  It's that you are instinctive.
[01:44:37.762 --> 01:44:39.103]  You're how God designed you.
[01:44:39.143 --> 01:44:40.304]  You're where you're supposed to be.
[01:44:40.725 --> 01:44:54.554]  I mean, let me tell you, you know, the average-sized guy, middle-aged guy, who you see stopping to change somebody's tire, the person you see helping an old woman across the street, guaranteed in a pinch,
[01:44:55.971 --> 01:45:07.455]  That guy will take apart some 300 pound steroid head meatball who's got the topless girlfriend dancer and drives the Corvette and who constantly thinks about how tough he is.
[01:45:08.435 --> 01:45:09.296]  And he's selfish.
[01:45:10.296 --> 01:45:10.576]  Okay?
[01:45:10.656 --> 01:45:22.300]  I guarantee you the guy, just the middle-aged guy you see stopped on the side of the road changing somebody's tire, that's somebody
[01:45:23.700 --> 01:45:29.443]  You know, that's the type of person where you hear the story of the police and witnesses, these are documented where a woman picks up a car off her kid.
[01:45:32.085 --> 01:45:45.172]  You start tapping into the primitive instincts, you start tapping into the survival mechanisms, you start tapping into what we really are, instead of the stunted, pathetic, perfumed, oiled jokes that we've become.
[01:45:45.192 --> 01:45:49.475]  And let me tell you something, you're going to be tuned into a drug so powerful,
[01:45:50.097 --> 01:45:55.842]  And it's what God wants to give you, and you won't, your life will no longer not be fulfilled.
[01:45:55.882 --> 01:45:57.704]  You will no longer be depressed.
[01:45:57.724 --> 01:46:05.410]  You will no longer, again, you need to have a life that is driven by a passion to do good and do the right thing.
[01:46:09.433 --> 01:46:18.461]  And when you tune into that, my friends, and so many of you, I just wish that you could discover, and I know most of our listeners have discovered it, but I wish that those out there who haven't would discover it.
[01:46:21.314 --> 01:46:29.316]  And you know they've taken the term service and they have denigrated it and they also take our instinct to do good and they manipulate it.
[01:46:29.696 --> 01:46:41.919]  They take our instinct and they tell the troops, go over here in Afghanistan, go over here in Iraq and fight an enemy and eat bad food and be treated like garbage and still have high morale because they're lying to themselves.
[01:46:42.659 --> 01:46:44.740]  Kevin Tillman and Pat Tillman didn't lie to themselves.
[01:46:46.944 --> 01:46:51.047]  You lie to yourself and you tell yourself, I'm over here to save people, I'm over here to help people.
[01:46:51.087 --> 01:46:54.190]  But after a turn or two, people learn that's not really the case.
[01:46:56.452 --> 01:47:00.195]  And so we just have to become humans again, not these little facsimiles.
[01:47:01.536 --> 01:47:04.579]  I see most Americans and they walk through the motions.
[01:47:05.239 --> 01:47:12.806]  They see an archetypal good looking woman on TV, the strong dominant male Clark Kent type on television.
[01:47:13.747 --> 01:47:18.790]  And they see these role models, and from a young age were meant to do this, they imprint on these role models.
[01:47:19.051 --> 01:47:26.615]  But you're meant to imprint on the role model in your tribe, at your camp, at your town, at your, you know, in the castle you live in.
[01:47:28.216 --> 01:47:32.639]  You're not meant to imprint on the fake facsimiles.
[01:47:32.679 --> 01:47:35.061]  I mean, you ever watch television?
[01:47:35.281 --> 01:47:39.924]  Every male role model is weak and stupid in a family setting.
[01:47:39.964 --> 01:47:41.845]  The women always tell the men what to do.
[01:47:43.181 --> 01:47:43.601]  We're good to go.
[01:48:02.398 --> 01:48:05.540]  So, you know, they tell the young males, look, you get the woman if you act stupid.
[01:48:05.560 --> 01:48:06.721]  I mean, it's really simple stuff.
[01:48:07.001 --> 01:48:17.407]  When you really, I mean, I'll sit there on the exercise bike at the gym when they got the TVs on, without the audio, with the closed captioning, and I mean, I know, oh, it's another sitcom, the male's gonna be stupid, the female's gonna be smart.
[01:48:18.708 --> 01:48:21.210]  The male's not gonna know what he's doing, the male's gonna be a fool.
[01:48:21.810 --> 01:48:23.191]  The male's gonna blow all the money.
[01:48:23.511 --> 01:48:25.332]  The male's gonna be out getting drunk every night.
[01:48:25.392 --> 01:48:26.533]  The male's gonna be a joke.
[01:48:27.401 --> 01:48:30.303]  I mean, you realize what type of a scientific attack that is?
[01:48:30.643 --> 01:48:32.424]  It isn't because they want to build you up, women.
[01:48:32.624 --> 01:48:41.369]  They want to take your men away from you, so you end up totally unhappy in a single-parent home, so your child can be hopped up on three or four drugs, and so they can go to the FEMA camp.
[01:48:44.651 --> 01:48:45.491]  That's what they want.
[01:48:46.852 --> 01:48:47.872]  That's what we've become.
[01:48:48.893 --> 01:48:50.634]  Why do you think the government pays a bounty?
[01:48:51.403 --> 01:48:54.624]  For every child that's on Ritalin or Prozac at a school.
[01:48:54.944 --> 01:48:57.145]  For every child that's in special education.
[01:48:57.725 --> 01:48:59.706]  For every child that goes to Juvenile Hall.
[01:49:01.486 --> 01:49:03.527]  Why do they pay the police the more people are arrested?
[01:49:03.547 --> 01:49:05.307]  No conviction needed, just get them in the system.
[01:49:05.667 --> 01:49:06.748]  Huge federal grants.
[01:49:09.589 --> 01:49:13.090]  You know, they get thousands of dollars for every child that's vaccinated.
[01:49:13.310 --> 01:49:20.192]  Did you know that almost half of the federal funds that schools get per child is tied directly to their vaccine records?
[01:49:20.882 --> 01:49:23.144]  No wonder they lie and say it's the law, when it's not.
[01:49:24.385 --> 01:49:29.329]  It should make all of you angry that there's no law you've got to vaccinate, but the news lies to you and tells you it is.
[01:49:29.769 --> 01:49:31.230]  That shows you you're in a matrix.
[01:49:33.793 --> 01:49:36.555]  So I just want the globalists to know, and all of them, you know, they can kill me.
[01:49:36.575 --> 01:49:38.116]  Again, I don't want to die.
[01:49:38.156 --> 01:49:39.097]  I'll never commit suicide.
[01:49:39.437 --> 01:49:40.038]  They can kill me.
[01:49:40.058 --> 01:49:40.478]  It doesn't matter.
[01:49:40.578 --> 01:49:41.419]  I've already won.
[01:49:42.219 --> 01:49:42.920]  You've already won.
[01:49:43.923 --> 01:49:50.666]  I'm a human being, you can't take it away from me, and I'm standing up, I'm standing up for the tribe, and it's beautiful.
[01:49:56.829 --> 01:50:02.312]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:50:02.692 --> 01:50:10.296]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:50:11.030 --> 01:50:18.073]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:50:18.473 --> 01:50:29.898]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:50:30.198 --> 01:50:33.720]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:50:34.180 --> 01:50:36.081]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:50:36.421 --> 01:50:40.283]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:51:25.948 --> 01:51:29.452]  It even reduces radon-222, lead, and other heavy metals.

[01:51:53.178 --> 01:52:01.105]  For years you've been hearing about Herbal Healer Academy and how it's remained a leader in effective alternative and natural medicine and education.
[01:52:01.565 --> 01:52:04.728]  But how can they continue to hold that title for years on end?
[01:52:05.108 --> 01:52:08.150]  The answer is high quality and huge selection.

[01:52:58.351 --> 01:53:02.472]  I kind of got long winded there talking about how we resist.
[01:53:02.572 --> 01:53:03.552]  It's a spiritual thing.
[01:53:04.466 --> 01:53:08.628]  And it's the thing dealing with your focus, your will, what you believe in.
[01:53:09.329 --> 01:53:14.312]  Again, the people that are self-centered are robbing themselves of what everything in life is about.
[01:53:14.592 --> 01:53:24.557]  And the people that take the easy road, the one that is mainstream, and the one that gets them the kudos by their neighbors and people.
[01:53:25.238 --> 01:53:27.359]  I could care less what some
[01:53:28.198 --> 01:53:28.878]  We're good to go.
[01:53:53.032 --> 01:53:54.472]  I mean, I've already lived the life I'm proud of.
[01:53:54.832 --> 01:54:00.634]  For all the bad things I've done, and folks, I've done plenty of bad things, and we all have, I'm still proud of my life.
[01:54:02.014 --> 01:54:05.355]  And there's a lot of things I'd have done different, but most of the things I'd have done the exact same way.
[01:54:05.375 --> 01:54:17.098]  Before I go to Rod and Tom and Melissa and Brian and Jeremiah and many others that are patiently holding, Freedom to Fascism, Aaron Russo's new film, is available
[01:54:17.950 --> 01:54:25.533]  We have it right now on DVD and when you order it for $19.95 you get Terror Storm for half price.
[01:54:25.553 --> 01:54:25.533]  $9.95.
[01:54:27.053 --> 01:54:29.034]  One film exposes government sponsored terror.
[01:54:29.794 --> 01:54:35.056]  The other film exposes the root of the problem, the private Federal Reserve and the
[01:54:36.005 --> 01:54:38.508]  Allied Crime Syndicate of the IRS that orbits it.
[01:54:39.008 --> 01:54:40.109]  Very important film.
[01:54:40.149 --> 01:54:41.871]  And by the way, people are going crazy ordering this.
[01:54:41.911 --> 01:54:42.732]  I'm glad you are.
[01:54:43.272 --> 01:54:47.256]  Please go to Infowars.com and order America, Freedom to Fascism.
[01:54:47.276 --> 01:54:54.784]  And if you haven't gotten TerrorStorm yet, get it with the combo pack and get the $9.95 TerrorStorm in three hours for half price.
[01:54:55.104 --> 01:54:58.828]  Or if you already have TerrorStorm, order the combo pack and give TerrorStorm as a gift to somebody.
[01:54:59.762 --> 01:55:08.105]  Okay, let's go ahead and talk to, the way you order, InfoWars.com or 888-253-3139 or write to me, Alex Jones at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, TX 78704 or again, 888-253-3139 or InfoWars.com.
[01:55:08.125 --> 01:55:10.206]  Okay, Rod in Montana, thanks for holding, welcome.
[01:55:29.003 --> 01:55:30.264]  Hey Alex, how's it going?
[01:55:31.444 --> 01:55:32.565]  My first time calling in.
[01:55:32.605 --> 01:55:42.731]  I just wanted to first thank you for everything that you continue to do to wake up the world, you know, against the tyranny and oppression that we're facing.
[01:55:44.832 --> 01:55:46.793]  I have a question about some advice actually.
[01:55:47.233 --> 01:55:49.354]  I've seen your movie Terror Storm.
[01:55:49.614 --> 01:55:55.057]  I've got the DVD and I'd like to actually start organizing local screenings here.
[01:55:55.217 --> 01:55:58.279]  I live in Butte, Montana, which is, you know, Montana is really
[01:55:59.249 --> 01:56:00.470]  Mostly Bush supporters.
[01:56:00.770 --> 01:56:01.051]  Yes.
[01:56:03.113 --> 01:56:12.401]  But I would like to start organizing screenings here and some friends of mine recommended maybe I should start showing it in my home and put ads in the paper.
[01:56:12.421 --> 01:56:14.283]  9-11 Truth.
[01:56:15.204 --> 01:56:17.906]  Well sir, you can do whatever you think.
[01:56:18.487 --> 01:56:24.973]  I would start it maybe, I'd find a group that wants to sponsor it with you, a group that already has people that attend.
[01:56:25.983 --> 01:56:27.104]  Yeah, that's what I care about.
[01:56:55.337 --> 01:56:57.818]  As time goes on, I just want to do something more and more.
[01:56:57.838 --> 01:57:02.461]  You know, I've given people DVDs, I've given them Terror Storm, Loose Change.
[01:57:02.481 --> 01:57:06.903]  I just, you know, I feel like whatever I do, it's not enough.
[01:57:07.723 --> 01:57:08.524]  Well, I understand that.
[01:57:08.584 --> 01:57:11.085]  That's how I feel, but you don't have to kill yourself doing it.
[01:57:12.086 --> 01:57:20.030]  I mean, I just know there's millions of other people just like you, more like termites, just chewing away at the foundations of this fraud.
[01:57:20.870 --> 01:57:22.311]  Anything else, Rod, you'd like to add?
[01:57:23.772 --> 01:57:29.315]  Uh, no, I just want to thank you again for everything you're doing and we support you and uh... Tell you what, stay there.
[01:57:29.335 --> 01:57:30.616]  I'm going to let you finish briefly on the other side.
[01:57:30.936 --> 01:57:31.677]  Third hour coming up.
[01:57:33.538 --> 01:57:38.060]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll free 877-376-45.
[01:57:38.081 --> 01:57:38.181]  Hello!
[01:57:38.201 --> 01:57:38.501]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.281 --> 01:57:52.342]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:53.062 --> 01:57:54.183]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.823 --> 01:57:55.643]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.384 --> 01:57:58.305]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:58.325 --> 01:58:01.846]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.147 --> 01:58:06.269]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:15.033 --> 01:58:17.414]  Welcome, my friends, now to the third and final hour.
[01:58:17.674 --> 01:58:19.455]  I will get into Iran condemns U.S.
[01:58:19.515 --> 01:58:20.556]  Gulf exercises.
[01:58:21.297 --> 01:58:22.898]  It's the type of story I have in my stack.
[01:58:22.938 --> 01:58:25.700]  I mean, I've got like 40 articles that are just as important as this one.
[01:58:27.101 --> 01:58:29.583]  Natives hit roadblock applying for state IDs.
[01:58:29.623 --> 01:58:31.084]  This is out of the Oregonian.
[01:58:31.985 --> 01:58:36.208]  They don't let the Native Americans have state IDs when this is their land, their country.
[01:58:37.309 --> 01:58:41.432]  Oh, but it says that the illegal aliens in the article don't have to.
[01:58:41.452 --> 01:58:41.952]  They get them.
[01:58:45.334 --> 01:58:46.635]  That's what I always point out.
[01:58:47.116 --> 01:58:50.218]  Citizens have to do all this stuff to get a bank account here in Texas.
[01:58:50.859 --> 01:58:56.362]  And I've watched illegals walk right up at Bank of America and other banks and just get whatever they want instantly.
[01:58:57.122 --> 01:58:59.123]  Because, again, it's policies.
[01:58:59.704 --> 01:59:01.504]  It's a policy to destroy this country.
[01:59:02.005 --> 01:59:03.465]  So we're going to... I shouldn't laugh at it.
[01:59:03.505 --> 01:59:04.486]  It's just so ridiculous.
[01:59:05.466 --> 01:59:09.288]  Let's go ahead and go back to Rod.
[01:59:09.589 --> 01:59:11.309]  He had one more thing he wanted to say for Montana.
[01:59:11.329 --> 01:59:11.710]  Go ahead.
[01:59:12.970 --> 01:59:16.572]  Well, yeah, I do want to thank you for everything you've been doing, but I just had enough.
[01:59:16.812 --> 01:59:17.753]  I did want to address
[01:59:18.900 --> 01:59:37.517]  One thing that one of your earlier callers was asking about, you know, the one who was asking about why the government would, you know, let America see that there were explosions going off, you know, below the demolition wave and, you know, after the buildings started collapsing.
[01:59:38.258 --> 01:59:41.761]  And I think it's all about the psychological impact of it.
[01:59:41.801 --> 01:59:45.164]  That's why there were two planes, I believe,
[01:59:46.183 --> 01:59:47.504]  Well, it was perfectly scripted.
[01:59:47.644 --> 01:59:51.970]  One thing gets hit, everybody tunes in, then they see the second, then one falls and the other falls.
[01:59:52.430 --> 01:59:55.975]  Clearly some of the explosives weren't timed exactly correctly.
[01:59:56.375 --> 01:59:58.358]  They were about a second and a half off proving it.
[01:59:58.859 --> 01:59:59.199]  Building 7...
[02:00:01.275 --> 02:00:04.697]  A lot of evidence shows there were really about 6 or 7 hijacked planes.
[02:00:04.777 --> 02:00:07.679]  Some evidence shows as many as 10, but I agree with 6 or 7.
[02:00:08.440 --> 02:00:10.461]  We know Flight 93 was going to the Capitol.
[02:00:10.501 --> 02:00:14.164]  We believe another flight that landed somewhere was going towards Building 7.
[02:00:14.264 --> 02:00:20.868]  So it looks like Building 7 was already rigged, and just so that no plane hit, they started to blow it up.
[02:00:21.708 --> 02:00:21.949]  Yeah.
[02:00:23.370 --> 02:00:29.954]  And you know, they wanted two planes because the first flight would draw media attention so that the whole world would be watching.
[02:00:30.543 --> 02:00:31.704]  When the second plane hit.
[02:00:32.285 --> 02:00:36.691]  And after the second plane hit, anybody who wasn't watching would then tune in to see the collapses.
[02:00:36.911 --> 02:00:38.713]  It was all a psychological operation.
[02:00:39.013 --> 02:00:41.717]  And it was done on a weekday morning.
[02:00:41.777 --> 02:00:43.138]  It was done for maximum effect.
[02:00:43.218 --> 02:00:44.901]  I appreciate your call and you keep it up.
[02:00:46.102 --> 02:00:48.805]  You know, the last two callers in a row are saying, what can we do?
[02:00:48.865 --> 02:00:49.406]  What can we do?
[02:00:49.466 --> 02:00:49.987]  What can we do?
[02:00:51.434 --> 02:00:56.937]  Don't let your energy be siphoned off into some fake liberal or conservative group or some watered-down organization.
[02:00:57.418 --> 02:00:58.278]  You be leaders.
[02:00:58.538 --> 02:01:00.519]  You know that your heart's in the right place.
[02:01:00.960 --> 02:01:02.400]  You know you've got the information.
[02:01:02.480 --> 02:01:03.061]  Take action.
[02:01:03.641 --> 02:01:07.283]  Now let's talk to Tom in California.
[02:01:07.323 --> 02:01:07.964]  Tom, welcome.
[02:01:08.744 --> 02:01:09.664]  Hey, how's it going, Alex?
[02:01:09.684 --> 02:01:10.005]  Good, sir.
[02:01:10.725 --> 02:01:11.826]  I have a few questions here.
[02:01:12.776 --> 02:01:14.698]  I'm calling from Eureka, California.
[02:01:14.718 --> 02:01:17.340]  It's just a few hours north of Bohemian Grove.
[02:01:17.380 --> 02:01:19.022]  I don't know if you're familiar with this area or not.
[02:01:19.222 --> 02:01:19.482]  I am.
[02:01:19.522 --> 02:01:20.163]  Very beautiful.
[02:01:20.243 --> 02:01:23.826]  In fact, if I could live anywhere I wanted to, my family's in Texas, so I'll stay here.
[02:01:24.186 --> 02:01:25.387]  But I love Northern California.
[02:01:25.768 --> 02:01:26.128]  Right on.
[02:01:27.309 --> 02:01:38.799]  I want to comment on a local billionaire businessman developer named Rob Arkley that lives in Eureka, and he brags about having connections to Karl Rove and Schwarzenegger, and he's put
[02:01:40.390 --> 02:01:43.492]  Millions of dollars into other state political campaigns.
[02:01:43.532 --> 02:01:47.654]  He put a half a million dollars into ousting Tom Daschle when that campaign was going on.
[02:01:47.674 --> 02:01:53.958]  And I just want to know if you've ever heard of the guy and maybe could possibly do some research on your, you know.
[02:01:55.399 --> 02:01:59.021]  Yeah, the name rings a bell in California politics about big neocon.
[02:01:59.421 --> 02:02:01.903]  But I mean, there's so many of these little rats.
[02:02:02.823 --> 02:02:08.287]  This guy hired for downtown Eureka, he's hired a private security firm to patrol
[02:02:09.617 --> 02:02:10.637]  Eureka, basically.
[02:02:10.677 --> 02:02:12.438]  And I want to know if that's legal, first of all.
[02:02:12.478 --> 02:02:13.498]  Well, it's not really.
[02:02:14.098 --> 02:02:16.819]  But what they do is they get town councils to sign off on it.
[02:02:17.239 --> 02:02:18.759]  And everything's going to that.
[02:02:18.779 --> 02:02:22.840]  You'll have private Blackwater ruling over you, you know, coming for your guns.
[02:02:22.940 --> 02:02:24.100]  But anything else?
[02:02:24.501 --> 02:02:24.721]  Yeah.
[02:02:24.861 --> 02:02:31.002]  Also, a couple of months ago, a woman who was off her meds was throwing stuff out her window.
[02:02:31.062 --> 02:02:34.783]  And I guess the SWAT team stormed her apartment and shot her nine times.
[02:02:36.264 --> 02:02:37.565]  And they got off scot-free.
[02:02:37.705 --> 02:02:41.346]  I tell you what, I got Mike Malloy coming up, but I want to hear more about this, so just stay there.
[02:02:41.366 --> 02:02:44.267]  We'll get to you during calls with Mike Malloy, or you can hang up if you want.
[02:02:44.287 --> 02:02:45.187]  Here we go.
[02:02:46.308 --> 02:02:51.929]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[02:02:52.290 --> 02:02:54.230]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[02:02:54.590 --> 02:03:02.193]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:03:02.935 --> 02:03:09.979]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:03:10.379 --> 02:03:21.806]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:03:22.126 --> 02:03:25.688]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:03:26.088 --> 02:03:27.969]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:03:28.350 --> 02:03:32.192]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:03:46.340 --> 02:03:49.922]  As snow falls on the majestic Rocky Mountains, it eventually melts.
[02:03:50.102 --> 02:03:55.945]  The water east of the continental divide travels downhill over 1,600 miles before reaching the Atlantic Ocean.
[02:03:56.145 --> 02:03:58.126]  On the western side, water travels downhill
[02:04:03.864 --> 02:04:08.209]  How many people and animals has that water passed through before it reaches my area?
[02:04:08.389 --> 02:04:12.374]  Berkey has revolutionized the way water is purified simply and naturally.
[02:04:12.554 --> 02:04:16.178]  At the heart of these portable systems are the black Berkey purification elements.
[02:04:16.358 --> 02:04:22.005]  So powerful, these elements extract pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, heavy metals, and yet more.
[02:04:22.005 --> 02:04:24.487]  Yeah, they can purify that downward flowing water.
[02:04:24.627 --> 02:04:31.553]  Berkey Purification Systems get rid of the unhealthy stuff in your water while leaving the healthy beneficial materials that your body needs.
[02:04:31.693 --> 02:04:35.136]  For more information on the powerful Berkey Purifiers, call New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[02:04:49.080 --> 02:04:49.941]  Look no further!
[02:04:50.241 --> 02:04:52.803]  Northern Voice Bookstore has everything you need.
[02:04:53.243 --> 02:05:01.790]  Hundreds of titles, from self-defense, survival, and financial freedom, to history, politics, conspiracy, and everything you need to know about the New World Order.
[02:05:01.910 --> 02:05:03.251]  You can order everything you need on
[02:05:03.251 --> 02:05:03.531]  I think so.
[02:05:19.428 --> 02:05:19.748]  I don't know.
[02:05:45.419 --> 02:05:50.441]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:05:50.821 --> 02:05:53.142]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:06:03.466 --> 02:06:07.888]  Well, we're really honored in this hour to be joined by Mike Malloy.
[02:06:07.908 --> 02:06:10.910]  And we'll open the phones up at the bottom of the hour for all of you that are holding.
[02:06:11.330 --> 02:06:11.930]  And Mike said,
[02:06:13.015 --> 02:06:18.681]  Nationally syndicated radio talk show host, and of course he was a big news producer at CNN before that.
[02:06:19.862 --> 02:06:22.044]  And I tell you, he's an amazing individual.
[02:06:22.064 --> 02:06:27.249]  When I would tune into Air America here locally in Austin, frankly, I couldn't stand most of the programs.
[02:06:27.924 --> 02:06:31.267]  They would attack George Bush on how he said nuclear.
[02:06:31.868 --> 02:06:33.789]  They would make little mindless jokes.
[02:06:33.809 --> 02:06:44.179]  It was kind of the inverse of Rush Limbaugh, you know, where he just doesn't attack anything substantive, just makes up little things or takes things out of context and builds straw men.
[02:06:44.579 --> 02:06:50.705]  And it was a little better than that, but it was very little hard news, hard information.
[02:06:51.816 --> 02:06:59.739]  And, uh, I really never tuned in, other than tuning in, uh, maybe once a week or so to listen to Mike Molloy, if I was out driving around at that time.
[02:07:00.880 --> 02:07:06.482]  And they fired him once, and then there was a big furor, so then they hired him back for a month or so.
[02:07:06.602 --> 02:07:07.622]  I've got to be on a show.
[02:07:07.662 --> 02:07:20.087]  He let me, zero censorship, let me, you know, go public with 9-11 being orchestrated, uh, by the criminals that, uh, own Bush, by an element of the military-industrial complex, a black op squad,
[02:07:20.925 --> 02:07:24.626]  And he got fired again, and most people believe it's because of 9-11.
[02:07:25.086 --> 02:07:25.606]  Period.
[02:07:25.626 --> 02:07:32.828]  They didn't tell him why, and he's about to tell you that story, but clearly it's because he wasn't what you'd call a mainline liberal or conservative.
[02:07:33.108 --> 02:07:36.909]  I mean, on this show, without prompting, he said, buy guns, get ready to defend yourself.
[02:07:37.309 --> 02:07:38.370]  He said that a few months ago.
[02:07:38.410 --> 02:07:39.410]  I'd say that's even more
[02:07:41.671 --> 02:07:45.932]  pertinent right now and poignant because H.R.
[02:07:45.952 --> 02:07:49.654]  6166, butchering nine of the first ten amendments, it does affect U.S.
[02:07:49.674 --> 02:07:50.074]  citizens.
[02:07:50.134 --> 02:07:52.195]  I mean, we're entering hell on earth here.
[02:07:52.235 --> 02:07:53.355]  This is really happening.
[02:07:53.375 --> 02:07:55.996]  I keep thinking it's a nightmare, but it's real.
[02:07:56.396 --> 02:07:58.497]  Mike Malloy, thank you so much for coming on with us.
[02:07:59.138 --> 02:07:59.658]  Sure, Alex.
[02:07:59.758 --> 02:08:00.458]  One correction.
[02:08:00.958 --> 02:08:02.959]  I was not fired twice, just once.
[02:08:05.500 --> 02:08:10.102]  You were a guest on my program in an immediate
[02:08:11.295 --> 02:08:15.699]  Um, run up to my getting fired, and I don't think it's because of you, I don't think it's because of 9-11.
[02:08:15.719 --> 02:08:18.161]  Well, you also had Tarpley on, too, and a bunch of others.
[02:08:18.422 --> 02:08:18.682]  Right.
[02:08:19.002 --> 02:08:37.599]  I honestly believe what happened was Air America started out with a mission, and that was to provide liberal, as is defined in this country, liberal, although most liberals hide behind the word and say, no, I'm not a liberal, I'm a progressive, which really, I don't know if I'm allowed to say it pisses me off on your program, Alex, but it does.
[02:08:38.092 --> 02:08:39.332]  If somebody's a liberal, be a liberal!
[02:08:39.432 --> 02:08:40.953]  Stand up for what you believe in.
[02:08:41.013 --> 02:08:56.278]  But anyway, the network was based on the idea they were going to provide liberal programming, and they had a bunch of liars, thieves, sneaks, and con artists jump in at the beginning with money, because rich liberals don't like to part with their money.
[02:08:56.518 --> 02:09:05.201]  Alex, one of the hardest lessons I've had to learn in the past two years in watching Air America flounder is that so many wealthy liberals, they're all mouth,
[02:09:05.834 --> 02:09:10.275]  They talk the talk, but they can't walk the walk, and that infuriates me.
[02:09:10.335 --> 02:09:11.515]  But that's just the way they are.
[02:09:11.555 --> 02:09:17.477]  Whereas rich conservatives will put their money behind anything if they think it's going to forward their agenda, no matter what their agenda is.
[02:09:18.017 --> 02:09:25.678]  So anyway, we wound up Air America at the very beginning with what I consider to be some real thuggish types who brought money.
[02:09:26.558 --> 02:09:33.480]  But those of us on the air went ahead with what we were hired to do, and that was to present a liberal point of view.
[02:09:34.247 --> 02:09:40.388]  And behind the scenes, these thugs were working on killing the network.
[02:09:40.428 --> 02:09:42.909]  Well, finally, they had a guy come in.
[02:09:43.529 --> 02:09:44.029]  I'll name him.
[02:09:44.089 --> 02:09:44.749]  I don't give a damn.
[02:09:44.790 --> 02:09:45.870]  His name is Bob Ennis.
[02:09:45.990 --> 02:09:49.071]  He came from News Corporation, which is a Murdoch company.
[02:09:50.051 --> 02:09:59.593]  And where it concerned me, when we discovered that I'd been underpaid for two years running my union representative, AFTRA,
[02:10:00.327 --> 02:10:01.728]  Said, you know, this has got to stop.
[02:10:01.848 --> 02:10:04.789]  So we worked out an agreement where we would go forward.
[02:10:04.849 --> 02:10:05.949]  I'd sign another contract.
[02:10:05.989 --> 02:10:08.870]  We'd go forward and they would pay me the money that they owed me.
[02:10:09.030 --> 02:10:15.313]  And when this Bob Ennis came back from vacation, wherever the hell I was... And by the way, I did see what some of the folks get paid there.
[02:10:15.533 --> 02:10:19.494]  Really a paltry sum for a national radio host.
[02:10:19.514 --> 02:10:20.475]  You know, that's the way it goes.
[02:10:20.535 --> 02:10:22.215]  You know, it was a startup company.
[02:10:22.275 --> 02:10:27.697]  So, you know, I figured, you know, unlike Al Franken, I figured, OK, you know, I'll take a small amount.
[02:10:27.717 --> 02:10:29.098]  But anyway, this Ennis came back.
[02:10:29.878 --> 02:10:32.919]  Saw how I was to be paid the money owed me and said, no, fire him.
[02:10:33.459 --> 02:10:34.799]  Well, in the first place, that's illegal.
[02:10:35.519 --> 02:10:36.459]  Uh, but it didn't matter.
[02:10:36.479 --> 02:10:38.580]  I mean, once they said, fire him, I got fired.
[02:10:39.360 --> 02:10:43.901]  So, you know, the lawsuits are flying and Air America's in bankruptcy and blah, blah, blah.
[02:10:43.921 --> 02:10:45.081]  And I'm sick and tired of it.
[02:10:45.721 --> 02:10:47.062]  I've got good friends at Air America.
[02:10:47.082 --> 02:10:48.202]  I hope they all survive.
[02:10:48.722 --> 02:10:50.302]  I've also got some people at Air America.
[02:10:50.362 --> 02:10:53.583]  I wouldn't give a damn if a truck hit them tomorrow, but you know, I'm ready to go forward.
[02:10:53.603 --> 02:10:57.484]  And that's why I'm working for Nova-M starting October 30th.
[02:10:57.504 --> 02:10:58.984]  We'll be back on the air from nine to midnight.
[02:10:59.685 --> 02:11:02.826]  Yeah, that's coming up starting on Monday.
[02:11:02.846 --> 02:11:04.146]  You're going to be on from 9 to midnight.
[02:11:04.166 --> 02:11:04.927]  Is that central?
[02:11:05.687 --> 02:11:06.287]  No, eastern.
[02:11:06.987 --> 02:11:12.629]  So you're going to be on from, I guess, 8 then to 11 central.
[02:11:13.589 --> 02:11:19.611]  Well, that's good news, Mike, and we're glad to have you on and promote that fact.
[02:11:19.871 --> 02:11:28.394]  Of course, we really got you here today to talk about Bush and HR 6166 and to take some calls from your supporters and fans out there.
[02:11:29.555 --> 02:11:29.995]  Well, no, not true.
[02:11:30.015 --> 02:11:31.856]  Fox had nothing to do with Air America.
[02:11:54.418 --> 02:11:57.284]  Well, what happened, they needed a CEO.
[02:11:57.364 --> 02:12:02.394]  The last CEO they had, a guy named Danny Goldberg, also turned out to be an absolutely incompetent thug.
[02:12:03.018 --> 02:12:06.159]  So they got rid of him the way so much of corporate America gets rid of people.
[02:12:06.199 --> 02:12:09.699]  They pay him half a million dollars a year for the next five years and say, go away.
[02:12:10.180 --> 02:12:11.660]  You know, golden parachutes and stuff.
[02:12:12.260 --> 02:12:22.462]  So the board at Air America then brought in a guy named Jim Wiggett, who, now maybe you can explain the logic in this one to me, Alex.
[02:12:22.522 --> 02:12:25.463]  Jim Wiggett came from the cosmetic industry.
[02:12:26.110 --> 02:12:31.774]  Not radio, not television, not newspapers, not communications, but he was a lipstick salesman, essentially.
[02:12:31.954 --> 02:12:38.438]  Well, that sounds better than somebody who runs horse shows for the Arabs being the head of FEMA.
[02:12:38.498 --> 02:12:40.019]  Not much, pal, not much.
[02:12:40.039 --> 02:12:51.246]  So they brought this guy in, Wiggett, and the first thing that he had a hard time doing, apparently, was understanding the combination of the men's room with the home office in New York.
[02:12:51.286 --> 02:12:52.647]  But he finally got that squared away.
[02:12:53.294 --> 02:12:56.015]  And then the next thing he did was start making stupid decisions.
[02:12:56.816 --> 02:13:02.979]  And this is nothing that people who have to deal with corporate America don't understand, Alex.
[02:13:03.959 --> 02:13:05.060]  I don't care what business we're in.
[02:13:05.640 --> 02:13:06.701]  We can be house painters.
[02:13:07.201 --> 02:13:13.324]  And the guy that runs the house painting crew, nine times out of ten, can't find his butt with his own hands.
[02:13:13.364 --> 02:13:15.965]  It's up to the worker bees to get the job done.
[02:13:16.725 --> 02:13:18.446]  And that's exactly how I felt.
[02:13:19.607 --> 02:13:21.848]  You know, as long as they leave me alone here in Atlanta,
[02:13:23.750 --> 02:13:24.830]  Just let me do my program.
[02:13:24.850 --> 02:13:34.493]  I didn't, you know, too much care about what happened in the upper levels of management, but that's the wrong way to think, because the upper levels of management were so incompetent at Air America and still are.
[02:13:35.073 --> 02:13:35.693]  Well, take a look.
[02:13:35.713 --> 02:13:37.113]  They're in bankruptcy, for God's sake.
[02:13:38.014 --> 02:13:39.734]  Now, I remember hearing the news.
[02:13:39.794 --> 02:13:47.816]  I guess then some of the Clear Channel and Fox radio stations did the experiment of, I guess, picking up Air America programming.
[02:13:47.836 --> 02:13:49.756]  Well, no, that goes way back.
[02:13:49.856 --> 02:13:52.557]  Clear Channel stations, in so many markets,
[02:13:53.323 --> 02:13:54.503]  For example, Atlanta.
[02:13:54.603 --> 02:13:55.203]  Here in Atlanta.
[02:13:55.584 --> 02:13:58.744]  I think we have eight stations here that are owned by Clear Channel.
[02:13:58.824 --> 02:14:09.467]  This is a result of Bill Clinton's signing off on the Republican-sponsored consolidation bill, which was a horrendous error, and one of many by Bill Clinton, in my opinion.
[02:14:10.067 --> 02:14:19.809]  But Air America got in touch with Clear Channel, or Clear Channel got in touch with Air America, because Clear Channel is, you know, they're in business to make money.
[02:14:21.977 --> 02:14:26.160]  And Clear Channel said, look, we've got three stations that make something.
[02:14:26.180 --> 02:14:31.744]  We've got three stations in Detroit, three talk stations, and all three of them are doing conservative programming, and they're competing with each other.
[02:14:32.204 --> 02:14:34.986]  We'll turn one of those stations over to Air America Programming.
[02:14:35.626 --> 02:14:45.193]  So that's how Clear Channel started carrying some Air America Programming, simply because of the potential for profit, which is why people are in the business to begin with.
[02:14:45.853 --> 02:14:46.373]  Exactly.
[02:14:47.114 --> 02:14:48.835]  Now, what about the final guy that came over?
[02:14:48.875 --> 02:14:50.056]  You said he came out of News Corp.
[02:14:50.811 --> 02:15:13.126]  Yeah, well the financial officer right now, the CFO I believe, I don't know what his title is, as far as I'm concerned, he's the glorified bookkeeper, but Bob Ennis, who came from News Corp, who apparently, along with Jim Wiggett, the CEO who came from the lipstick industry, these guys are making decisions, programming decisions, because Air America had nobody in charge of programming.
[02:15:13.709 --> 02:15:15.571]  Now, that would be people like me.
[02:15:15.792 --> 02:15:21.278]  If the CFO or the CEO said, well, what about this Malloy guy that's out from 10pm to 1am?
[02:15:21.399 --> 02:15:22.019]  Ah, to hell with him.
[02:15:22.039 --> 02:15:22.620]  Let's get rid of him.
[02:15:22.720 --> 02:15:23.021]  Bang!
[02:15:23.661 --> 02:15:24.783]  No consideration.
[02:15:25.444 --> 02:15:26.865]  From a programming standpoint.
[02:15:27.066 --> 02:15:29.948]  So, as a result of that firing... Well, I think it's more than that.
[02:15:29.988 --> 02:15:32.210]  I mean, you were talking about 9-11 every week.
[02:15:32.590 --> 02:15:33.812]  You were talking about treason.
[02:15:33.832 --> 02:15:35.253]  You were talking about crime family.
[02:15:35.293 --> 02:15:36.154]  Well, that's true.
[02:15:36.174 --> 02:15:38.456]  I mean, you say Bush crime family every other sentence.
[02:15:38.636 --> 02:15:40.838]  That's very true, and I don't know.
[02:15:41.078 --> 02:15:50.927]  And Alex, like so much goes on in this country, it's like they say about when you get hit by a sniper bullet, you never hear of the rifle shot that brings you down.
[02:15:51.525 --> 02:15:55.008]  So I have no idea what really happened.
[02:15:55.249 --> 02:15:58.432]  I'm only accepting at face value.
[02:15:58.992 --> 02:16:03.156]  I know you got canned the week after you had a bunch of 9-11 critters on.
[02:16:03.516 --> 02:16:10.443]  Well, also, if you want to go that route, it was also after about a month or six weeks of hardcore
[02:16:11.415 --> 02:16:18.500]  Criticism of the government of Israel for their practices in South Lebanon with the latest battle there.
[02:16:18.600 --> 02:16:26.005]  So, you know, if someone wants to go that route, if you want to say, well, 9-11, criticizing Israel, I guess you can.
[02:16:26.625 --> 02:16:28.927]  But again, it's just like getting hit by a sniper's bullet.
[02:16:28.947 --> 02:16:30.528]  You never know where it came from.
[02:16:30.888 --> 02:16:31.628]  I have no idea.
[02:16:31.829 --> 02:16:33.850]  I'm accepting at face value that they
[02:16:34.588 --> 02:16:37.390]  I just decided to get rid of somebody, and I was it.
[02:16:37.410 --> 02:16:41.092]  They couldn't get rid of Al Franken, they couldn't get rid of Randy Rhoades, who the hell are they going to get rid of?
[02:16:41.412 --> 02:16:41.872]  Hello?
[02:16:41.892 --> 02:16:50.057]  Well, I've got to be honest, I really can't listen to Al Franken or Randy Rhoades.
[02:16:50.137 --> 02:16:57.861]  Well, I can't listen to Al, and Randy, I don't have a choice anymore, because there's no Air America station in Atlanta.
[02:16:57.881 --> 02:16:58.682]  We had one here, but
[02:16:59.651 --> 02:17:05.916]  It was bought by somebody, and he said the first thing I'm going to do is get rid of all this Air America programming, and he did.
[02:17:08.839 --> 02:17:15.044]  You know, in talk radio, different people have different tastes as far as what they like to hear.
[02:17:15.544 --> 02:17:20.308]  Hell, Alex, I've sat down sometimes and listened to a rebroadcast of my show, and I can't stand it.
[02:17:21.429 --> 02:17:22.210]  You've got a good show.
[02:17:22.930 --> 02:17:23.991]  Stay there, Mike Malloy.
[02:17:24.031 --> 02:17:28.475]  Let's get into your take on what's happening in this country right now, and then we'll go to some of the phone calls.
[02:17:29.221 --> 02:17:31.010]  Coming up we'll get into Iran condemns U.S.
[02:17:31.070 --> 02:17:32.034]  Gulf exercises.
[02:17:32.095 --> 02:17:33.059]  Are they going to hit Iran?
[02:17:33.079 --> 02:17:33.983]  We'll be right back.
[02:17:47.156 --> 02:17:50.840]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[02:17:51.240 --> 02:17:56.665]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[02:17:57.126 --> 02:17:58.187]  It makes me wonder if a U.S.
[02:17:58.247 --> 02:18:02.291]  citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[02:18:02.939 --> 02:18:16.247]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Ruling 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act in Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[02:18:16.267 --> 02:18:22.071]  For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.
[02:18:22.351 --> 02:18:28.235]  Whether if you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not, I have instructed my representatives to give this report out free.
[02:18:28.995 --> 02:18:30.777]  Call for your free copy at 1-800-686-2237.
[02:18:31.837 --> 02:18:35.020]  When investing, always proceed with caution.
[02:18:35.460 --> 02:18:38.662]  Again, call 1-800-686-2237.
[02:18:39.122 --> 02:18:42.665]  Exercise your legal right to trade metals privately.
[02:18:42.685 --> 02:18:44.206]  1-800-686-2237.
[02:18:46.588 --> 02:18:52.592]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism, but globalism.
[02:18:52.612 --> 02:18:54.033]  Globalists are concerned
[02:19:00.484 --> 02:19:02.646]  Poison of globalism is nationalism.
[02:19:03.046 --> 02:19:05.047]  Start reading The Nationalist Times each month.
[02:19:05.287 --> 02:19:10.671]  The Nationalist Times promotes a common sense, intelligent, and passionate alternative to the reigning party line.
[02:19:10.991 --> 02:19:19.717]  Published monthly since 1985, The Nationalist Times is a 20-page newspaper featuring outstanding writers and columnists who don't believe in taboos or sacred cows.
[02:19:19.977 --> 02:19:23.140]  Be one of the many thousands of loyal readers of The Nationalist Times.
[02:19:23.680 --> 02:19:24.260]  We're good to go.
[02:19:46.451 --> 02:19:51.675]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[02:19:51.815 --> 02:19:59.901]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[02:20:00.161 --> 02:20:07.226]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[02:20:07.406 --> 02:20:08.667]  Radioactive Poisoning.
[02:20:08.747 --> 02:20:14.651]  Potassium Iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[02:20:14.831 --> 02:20:19.935]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[02:20:20.055 --> 02:20:28.921]  Potassium Iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick and pets.
[02:20:29.181 --> 02:20:32.484]  Order the official Potassium Iodate for only $24 and save $5.

[02:20:45.995 --> 02:20:54.623]  David J. Smith, did you know that a plan was laid down in the 1870s to conquer the world for world government that has not been deviated from since its inception?
[02:20:55.443 --> 02:21:00.428]  These conspirators said that they must have many revolutionary wars and three world wars.
[02:21:01.108 --> 02:21:07.092]  Have we witnessed these wars of liberation since the 1920s and then World War I and World War II?
[02:21:07.793 --> 02:21:16.219]  The Illuminati, who are worshippers of Lucifer, are now preparing for the final conflict, the Third World War, to produce their One World Government.
[02:21:16.972 --> 02:21:24.616]  We'd like to help you understand how these things are coming about by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to NewsWatch Magazine.

[02:22:07.069 --> 02:22:09.270]  Your calls are coming up in the next segment.
[02:22:09.290 --> 02:22:09.811]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:22:10.171 --> 02:22:14.033]  Mike Malloy wowed me last time he was on.
[02:22:14.073 --> 02:22:17.835]  He just out of the blue said, now's the time to buy guns, now's the time to get ready to defend yourself.
[02:22:18.804 --> 02:22:21.247]  And yeah, I mean it could come down to that.
[02:22:21.687 --> 02:22:23.729]  Gun confiscations, mass roundups.
[02:22:24.249 --> 02:22:25.751]  It does affect US citizens.
[02:22:25.791 --> 02:22:27.893]  Houston Chronicle reporting on FEMA camps.
[02:22:28.674 --> 02:22:32.837]  I mean, I've actually started looking at foreign countries to evacuate my family to.
[02:22:33.338 --> 02:22:35.340]  I have promised to go down with a ship.
[02:22:36.173 --> 02:22:39.115]  And, I mean, I'm not saying this for theatrics.
[02:22:39.195 --> 02:22:41.036]  Listen, I lay awake at night now.
[02:22:41.056 --> 02:22:43.538]  I mean, Bush may become imperial ruler.
[02:22:43.558 --> 02:22:44.218]  Do you understand?
[02:22:44.238 --> 02:22:48.361]  And that's my analysis.
[02:22:48.461 --> 02:22:49.162]  I'm freaked out.
[02:22:49.222 --> 02:22:52.164]  Mike Malloy, are you as freaked out, or do you think everything's okay?
[02:22:53.564 --> 02:22:58.848]  I've got to remain, to the extent that I can, Alex, an optimist.
[02:22:59.168 --> 02:23:00.949]  My thing about guns, I've always been a gun owner.
[02:23:01.089 --> 02:23:02.070]  I've always been a hunter.
[02:23:02.805 --> 02:23:03.385]  Small game.
[02:23:03.445 --> 02:23:04.606]  I've never gone after big game.
[02:23:05.166 --> 02:23:08.007]  Back in the day, I was a member of the NRA until they got crazy.
[02:23:08.707 --> 02:23:11.668]  And I dropped my NRA membership probably 25 years ago.
[02:23:11.788 --> 02:23:21.932]  But as far as gun ownership is concerned, I've said it before, that as far as responsible gun ownership, I have no problem with that.
[02:23:22.072 --> 02:23:22.572]  I am one.
[02:23:24.048 --> 02:23:44.428]  As far as for self-defense and for the possibility of something really, really, really weird happening in this country to a greater extent than it is already, I honestly believe if we still have any respect for the people who put this country together at the very beginning,
[02:23:45.163 --> 02:23:48.804]  Then responsible people will make sure that they have access.
[02:23:48.984 --> 02:23:55.625]  And I'm sorry if this irritates liberals, because I consider myself a liberal, but responsible people will make sure they have access to firearms.
[02:23:56.585 --> 02:24:01.386]  And that's not to go out and rape and pillage and loot and shoot and kill folks and rob grocery stores.
[02:24:01.406 --> 02:24:10.007]  That's to, if it becomes necessary, to defend oneself, to organize in militias or whatever it takes.
[02:24:10.087 --> 02:24:13.128]  Jesus, I sound like an absolute right-wing nut here, but I'm sorry.
[02:24:13.666 --> 02:24:15.547]  You know, George Bush has pushed this issue.
[02:24:16.447 --> 02:24:18.607]  The neocon right has pushed this issue.
[02:24:18.627 --> 02:24:28.830]  And it's gotten to the point where, as far as I'm concerned, American citizens have an obligation, several obligations.
[02:24:28.930 --> 02:24:30.971]  First of all, be politically informed.
[02:24:31.111 --> 02:24:32.131]  Don't be conned.
[02:24:32.271 --> 02:24:34.212]  Don't buy the lies and the stories.
[02:24:35.232 --> 02:24:39.993]  And to take advantage of the fact that in this country you can own weapons.
[02:24:40.114 --> 02:24:41.714]  There's a lot of countries where you can't.
[02:24:42.798 --> 02:24:45.360]  I wish I lived in a society where guns were not necessary.
[02:24:45.380 --> 02:24:46.801]  I've said that before a million times.
[02:24:46.861 --> 02:24:49.482]  But as long as there's bad people out there with them, we've got to have them.
[02:24:49.723 --> 02:24:53.705]  But I mean, do you ever... Especially when the bad people are in the damn government.
[02:24:53.925 --> 02:24:54.325]  Exactly.
[02:24:54.345 --> 02:24:58.228]  I mean, Mike Malloy, do you ever lay in bed at night just thinking, how did it ever get this crazy?
[02:24:58.448 --> 02:25:00.949]  I mean, I never thought it would get this crazy this fast.
[02:25:00.989 --> 02:25:04.812]  I mean, this is so obvious that Bush is trying to be a dictator.
[02:25:05.232 --> 02:25:05.732]  I have.
[02:25:06.353 --> 02:25:08.854]  I have had that conversation in my own head.
[02:25:08.874 --> 02:25:11.376]  I've sat there and talked with my wife Kathy.
[02:25:12.886 --> 02:25:34.675]  You know, I've said before, I've got grandchildren, but I also have a two-year-old daughter, and it just disturbs the hell out of me, Alex, that I have to sit here with my wife and talk about what she and I need to do in order to even prepare a little bit for potential
[02:25:36.030 --> 02:25:39.452]  Different potential disasters that this government may bring on us.
[02:25:39.932 --> 02:25:41.994]  I can't stand having that kind of conversation.
[02:25:42.494 --> 02:25:50.898]  At my age, Alex, I thought, you know, okay, I'm going to live my life and, you know, when I hit the age I'm at now, maybe things will ease up a bit.
[02:25:51.018 --> 02:25:58.302]  Maybe the liberals and the conservatives will have beat the hell out of each other and come to some kind of conclusion that it's best to find
[02:26:00.558 --> 02:26:10.048]  A peaceful way to run this country, a lawful way to run this country, a constitutionally lawful way to run this country, and everybody can just kind of chill out.
[02:26:10.368 --> 02:26:11.710]  You know, just take it easy.
[02:26:12.190 --> 02:26:14.092]  Well, that didn't happen.
[02:26:14.212 --> 02:26:16.935]  So like you, I sometimes think, what the hell?
[02:26:16.975 --> 02:26:17.596]  Where do I live?
[02:26:18.038 --> 02:26:18.799]  What happened here?
[02:26:18.899 --> 02:26:19.679]  What happened here?
[02:26:20.060 --> 02:26:21.220]  And I don't have any answers, Alex.
[02:26:21.261 --> 02:26:22.461]  Well, it is a feeling.
[02:26:22.862 --> 02:26:26.344]  I mean, it's a feeling of like coming home and somebody's broken into your house.
[02:26:26.384 --> 02:26:28.126]  That's happened to a lot of people that haven't.
[02:26:28.146 --> 02:26:28.606]  Well, there you go.
[02:26:28.786 --> 02:26:29.907]  That's a good analogy, yeah.
[02:26:30.608 --> 02:26:32.109]  I mean, that feeling of being violated.
[02:26:32.149 --> 02:26:33.490]  It's like, who is this person?
[02:26:33.550 --> 02:26:34.491]  Who are these people?
[02:26:34.731 --> 02:26:38.674]  You know, it's like that Bob Dylan song of they think they own the world and it's their toy.
[02:26:39.134 --> 02:26:39.514]  Right.
[02:26:39.955 --> 02:26:40.815]  Right, exactly.
[02:26:42.153 --> 02:26:43.494]  And I don't quite get it.
[02:26:44.354 --> 02:26:51.137]  I read an essay, I forget, I wish I could remember who wrote it, but these people are involved for the power, strictly for the power.
[02:26:51.237 --> 02:26:54.118]  I don't think they have any agenda other than the accumulation of power.
[02:26:54.899 --> 02:27:06.084]  I don't think... That's what dictators always do, and psychopaths, is that they get all total control, they've still got to exercise some power, and so they start just stomping on people because it's what they do.
[02:27:06.524 --> 02:27:08.125]  Yes, yes.
[02:27:08.305 --> 02:27:10.446]  I'm not a happy camper, Alex.
[02:27:11.002 --> 02:27:20.927]  Mike Malloy, I want to talk about the upcoming election, how much Diebold, how much Sequoia, how much Hardener Civics, Fraud we'll be seeing, and also take some calls, 1-800-259-9231.
[02:27:22.528 --> 02:27:25.830]  Graciously spending time with us, we're honored to have him, he is a good apple.
[02:27:26.150 --> 02:27:31.173]  He's Mike Malloy, and he'll be back on the radio, starting next week, 9 to midnight, Eastern.
[02:27:36.175 --> 02:27:39.057]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[02:27:40.072 --> 02:27:42.854]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.437 --> 02:27:48.919]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network.
[02:27:49.039 --> 02:27:51.400]  I have an urgent message for all of our listeners.
[02:27:51.460 --> 02:27:58.526]  The mass media keeps telling us that we are the richest, most powerful economy in the world, quote unquote.
[02:27:59.126 --> 02:28:01.428]  If this is true, why can't we pay our bills?
[02:28:02.068 --> 02:28:05.551]  Why is the United States the world's largest debtor nation?
[02:28:06.155 --> 02:28:10.296]  The truth is, is that we are in the worst debt bubble in our nation's history.
[02:28:10.856 --> 02:28:13.857]  When the bubble bursts, will you be able to feed your family?
[02:28:14.817 --> 02:28:17.738]  When the inevitable crash occurs, will you be ready?
[02:28:18.478 --> 02:28:21.079]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.
[02:28:21.219 --> 02:28:21.719]  That's 1-888-892-6238.

[02:28:45.599 --> 02:28:49.180]  Do you know where the 78 potentially active volcanoes in the U.S.
[02:28:49.220 --> 02:28:49.720]  are located?
[02:28:49.920 --> 02:28:53.321]  And do you know the locations of the top 300 prime terrorist targets?
[02:28:53.541 --> 02:28:58.242]  You can find these answers and more in the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA.

[02:29:47.034 --> 02:29:51.157]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass?
[02:29:51.377 --> 02:29:53.138]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[02:29:53.398 --> 02:29:59.682]  If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough, the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[02:29:59.983 --> 02:30:06.107]  Using this similar principle, Royal Raymond Rife discovered that diseased organisms can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[02:30:06.347 --> 02:30:08.208]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument
[02:30:08.468 --> 02:30:08.888]  I think so.
[02:30:30.974 --> 02:30:33.615]  Okay, these phone calls are going to be all over the map.
[02:31:00.043 --> 02:31:00.724]  And that's fine.
[02:31:00.784 --> 02:31:02.887]  Mike Belois and Tasha Hosea can chime in on them.
[02:31:03.848 --> 02:31:06.151]  Tom, Drew, Paul, Ed, Melissa, many others.
[02:31:06.171 --> 02:31:07.312]  We're going to go to your calls right now.
[02:31:07.352 --> 02:31:11.678]  And then before our illustrious guest leaves us, I want to get his take on the upcoming election.
[02:31:11.998 --> 02:31:14.942]  Notice, Mike, obviously you've seen this.
[02:31:14.962 --> 02:31:15.463]  You're astute.
[02:31:16.281 --> 02:31:33.509]  They're telling us, oh, the Help America Vote Act, paying for all those special no-record CIA-controlled voting machines to be put in, despite the fact that all these engineers and employees have gone public saying they were hired to rig it to steal votes and rig it with wireless systems.
[02:31:33.949 --> 02:31:38.373]  Now the New York Times tells us, oh, there's going to be record problems this year.
[02:31:38.634 --> 02:31:40.455]  The high-tech stuff's even worse.
[02:31:40.816 --> 02:31:43.318]  So when I hear problem, that lets me know fraud.
[02:31:43.338 --> 02:31:44.939]  But they've got a problem.
[02:31:45.340 --> 02:31:48.603]  In 2000 and 2004, clearly the election was stolen.
[02:31:49.203 --> 02:31:50.625]  Kerry clearly took a dive.
[02:31:51.557 --> 02:31:54.780]  A total ringer, but now everybody's watching.
[02:31:54.900 --> 02:32:00.845]  Now in major polls, 90 plus percent believe there's election fraud, and the people are angry.
[02:32:00.885 --> 02:32:05.228]  So, do you think Bush and Roe will steal the election in front of everyone?
[02:32:06.269 --> 02:32:07.290]  I think they'll try.
[02:32:07.310 --> 02:32:15.917]  These Diebold machines, these ESS, I think there are three or four companies that make these machines.
[02:32:18.251 --> 02:32:25.255]  There is no reason not to try to steal it, because it's almost impossible to take a look at the software.
[02:32:25.275 --> 02:32:29.377]  If you can see it, it's proprietary software.
[02:32:30.118 --> 02:32:32.379]  This is the thing that irritates the hell out of me, Alex.
[02:32:32.959 --> 02:32:44.726]  We're talking about voting here, and the companies that have been given the contracts to build the machines say, well, we're not going to show you the computer programs.
[02:32:45.532 --> 02:32:46.832]  Because it's proprietary.
[02:32:47.073 --> 02:32:49.974]  So, you'll take our word for it, or to hell with you.
[02:32:50.574 --> 02:33:00.037]  And I don't think anything has made me more angry than this voting machine thing that developed in the 2000 presidential election.
[02:33:00.397 --> 02:33:02.818]  As far as the New York Times just discovering there's a problem,
[02:33:03.443 --> 02:33:06.386]  It just makes you want to go up and smack the hell out of somebody.
[02:33:06.786 --> 02:33:16.093]  People have been talking, the responsible people, and some of us out here on the fringe who are not very responsible, like me, have been talking about the theft of these elections going all the way back to 2000.
[02:33:16.834 --> 02:33:27.943]  I live here in Georgia, Alex, and I watch what happened in 2002 when the governorship was stolen, when Senator Max Cleland, triple amputee from Vietnam, had his Senate seat stolen,
[02:33:28.544 --> 02:33:29.585]  I know what I'm talking about.
[02:33:29.685 --> 02:33:30.225]  I lived here.
[02:33:30.365 --> 02:33:35.288]  And Georgia was the first place where every single precinct in the state had to use the de-bolt machine.
[02:33:35.808 --> 02:33:41.652]  And as a result, we got some losers in office here that no way in hell they would have been elected into office.
[02:33:42.170 --> 02:33:44.351]  Had it not been for these gummed up machines.
[02:33:44.491 --> 02:33:46.072]  Here's my question to Mike Malloy.
[02:33:46.092 --> 02:33:58.277]  The scientific polling agencies, Zogby, Gallup, Scripps Howard News Service, Angus and Reed, they're all showing Republicans losing 25 to 30 seats in the House.
[02:34:00.057 --> 02:34:09.623]  10 to 15 seats, 7 seats minimum in the Senate, but then the neocon polls come out and say, oh no, it's neck and neck, and Bush says, I'm totally confident we're going to win.
[02:34:09.924 --> 02:34:13.186]  What's going to happen in the future is they steal and steal and steal and steal.
[02:34:13.746 --> 02:34:16.828]  Clear Channel owns the voting machines everybody votes on here in Travis County.
[02:34:16.868 --> 02:34:26.014]  People who are way behind in polls magically win, like Michael McCaul, because he's married to Lowry Mays, the owner of Clear Channel's daughter, and Lowry Mays is his biggest contributor, and he owns
[02:34:27.735 --> 02:34:36.360]  We've got Senator Hagel owning the company, or being the chairman of the company that he magically wins with.
[02:34:36.580 --> 02:34:42.243]  Soon we'll just have voting machine company owners, and maybe they'll vote themselves king and wear little gold crowns.
[02:34:42.864 --> 02:34:51.189]  It's going to come to a head, it is coming to a head, where the people know it's a fraud, the polls show it's a fraud, the exit polls show it's a fraud.
[02:34:51.889 --> 02:34:54.991]  They've got this power now to steal elections, but can they get away with it?
[02:34:55.331 --> 02:34:56.872]  Well, you know, Stalin said it.
[02:34:56.952 --> 02:34:58.312]  I'm going to garble what he said.
[02:34:58.372 --> 02:35:00.734]  He said something to the effect that anyone can pull the election.
[02:35:00.774 --> 02:35:02.754]  What matters is who counts the votes.
[02:35:04.055 --> 02:35:07.016]  And we have a Stalinist system in this country now.
[02:35:07.136 --> 02:35:08.857]  So I don't know, Alex.
[02:35:09.337 --> 02:35:14.800]  I would think that with feelings running in this country the way they're running now about
[02:35:15.350 --> 02:35:28.636]  About the Iraq occupation, about threatening half the countries in the world, about just the spiraling down that Bush and Cheney and Rumsfeld have pushed this country into.
[02:35:28.976 --> 02:35:30.476]  We're a torture nation now.
[02:35:30.817 --> 02:35:35.458]  We have a gulag scattered all over the planet with secret prison camps.
[02:35:35.859 --> 02:35:39.260]  We have FEMA developing detention centers in the United States.
[02:35:39.820 --> 02:35:43.622]  If America can't vote these people out at this point,
[02:35:44.198 --> 02:35:46.699]  Then something is horribly wrong.
[02:35:46.759 --> 02:35:53.720]  Now, I think the collective consciousness in this country is realizing the situation that we're in.
[02:35:54.680 --> 02:36:07.823]  And I think, perhaps, if there is not a turnaround, and in some instances, I hate like hell to see certain Democrats get into positions of power, but what are you going to do?
[02:36:08.303 --> 02:36:09.764]  For the time being, what are you going to do?
[02:36:10.144 --> 02:36:11.544]  But if that doesn't happen,
[02:36:12.285 --> 02:36:24.031]  I would think maybe, perhaps, this time, the American public will say no, and they'll act like Serbs, or they'll act like people in the former Soviet Republic of Georgia, or they'll act like people, uh, uh... Romania!
[02:36:24.691 --> 02:36:26.852]  Romania, where people come out and say no!
[02:36:27.032 --> 02:36:28.733]  By God, that's not...
[02:36:29.253 --> 02:36:30.074]  That's what we voted for.
[02:36:30.114 --> 02:36:31.435]  That's not what we want.
[02:36:31.495 --> 02:36:35.538]  That's in the anti-jail forces who shoot us with rubber bullets.
[02:36:35.679 --> 02:36:37.600]  Yeah, well... No, no, listen.
[02:36:38.381 --> 02:36:39.061]  It's going to happen.
[02:36:39.101 --> 02:36:40.042]  They're gearing up for it.
[02:36:40.082 --> 02:36:40.663]  They're ready.
[02:36:41.003 --> 02:36:42.304]  But it's going to backfire on them.
[02:36:42.324 --> 02:36:45.807]  Because, I mean, do we want to live in a country where we know they're stealing the elections?
[02:36:45.907 --> 02:36:46.628]  And they're doing it.
[02:36:47.188 --> 02:36:48.890]  I mean, this is, again, it's scary.
[02:36:49.290 --> 02:36:49.630]  I know.
[02:36:49.810 --> 02:36:50.311]  I know.
[02:36:50.571 --> 02:36:52.392]  And, Mike Malloy, you've had all the guests on.
[02:36:52.433 --> 02:36:53.173]  You know the facts.
[02:36:53.734 --> 02:36:56.416]  In your gut, you've got to know 9-11's an inside job.
[02:36:57.641 --> 02:37:01.884]  I've said before, Alex, I do not buy the official story.
[02:37:01.904 --> 02:37:02.805]  I don't know.
[02:37:02.965 --> 02:37:04.066]  I go to your site.
[02:37:04.146 --> 02:37:05.126]  I go to a lot of sites.
[02:37:05.206 --> 02:37:06.147]  I check on this stuff.
[02:37:06.928 --> 02:37:09.089]  I watch the movies, loose change.
[02:37:09.870 --> 02:37:11.071]  I watch all this stuff.
[02:37:11.551 --> 02:37:14.393]  As far as I'm concerned, the official story is a lie.
[02:37:14.873 --> 02:37:16.474]  Now, I don't know what happened.
[02:37:16.834 --> 02:37:17.654]  Well, I agree with you.
[02:37:17.674 --> 02:37:23.217]  I mean, we know the official story is a fraud, and we know they've been covering up and lying, so right there, right there, we've got them.
[02:37:23.417 --> 02:37:29.560]  I know some of you folks who have studied this to a far greater degree than I have have come to some pretty firm conclusions.
[02:37:29.700 --> 02:37:30.421]  I'm not there yet.
[02:37:30.521 --> 02:37:34.102]  All I know, Alex, is I don't believe the official story.
[02:37:34.463 --> 02:37:41.606]  I will never believe that 19 halfwits who were out drinking the night before and chasing strippers
[02:37:42.319 --> 02:37:54.318]  Somehow got on board of four jetliners with box cutters and defeated the entire United States military trillion dollar defense system and did what they did.
[02:37:54.518 --> 02:37:55.840]  I cannot accept that.
[02:37:56.041 --> 02:37:57.263]  I cannot accept that.
[02:37:57.483 --> 02:38:07.509]  Well, Mr. Steele, a high-level former CIA officer, Marine Corps intelligence officer, I think I'm digging out his info here, he's on Thursday, he's been a big Republican.
[02:38:07.529 --> 02:38:13.092]  He said he looked at the evidence, he's gone public, he's saying it's got to be a U.S.-based inside job.
[02:38:13.473 --> 02:38:16.174]  Now, he's saying, was it provocateur or did they totally engineer it?
[02:38:16.214 --> 02:38:16.815]  He doesn't know.
[02:38:17.095 --> 02:38:23.899]  But again, he knows all the evidence points 180 degrees away from the official narrative that it is just that.
[02:38:23.939 --> 02:38:25.480]  I mean, it is a fairy tale, folks.
[02:38:25.780 --> 02:38:39.068]  Well, at the very best, in terms of all of us retaining our sanity, at the very best, the incompetence of the Bush administration when there were threats and warnings that such a thing was going to happen.
[02:38:39.829 --> 02:38:42.691]  The very best scenario for these thugs is they let it happen.
[02:38:43.491 --> 02:38:44.332]  Beyond that, I don't know.
[02:38:44.372 --> 02:38:46.293]  But you know, and a lot of your listeners know,
[02:38:47.242 --> 02:38:50.765]  About Operation Northwoods, if you don't know about it, Google it for God's sake.
[02:38:50.785 --> 02:39:05.596]  It goes all the way back to Kennedy, when the Joint Chiefs said to Kennedy, let's engineer an attack, blame it on Cuba, we'll knock down a couple of buildings, we'll blow up a couple of American cities, we'll kill a few thousand American citizens, blame it on the Cubans, that'll give us reason to attack.
[02:39:06.096 --> 02:39:12.621]  So, it's out there, Alex, and that was 45 years ago, so if anybody thinks this stuff is fairy tale,
[02:39:13.368 --> 02:39:18.511]  Or, oh, you're a bunch of tinfoil hat conspiracy freaks.
[02:39:18.991 --> 02:39:21.113]  All I suggest is you take a look at history.
[02:39:21.153 --> 02:39:22.133]  And Kennedy killed it.
[02:39:23.494 --> 02:39:27.076]  Who was the head of the Strategic Air Command?
[02:39:27.096 --> 02:39:28.257]  Was it Lemner?
[02:39:28.297 --> 02:39:28.657]  Yeah, L.L.
[02:39:28.677 --> 02:39:31.138]  Lemser and the psychopath May was in there.
[02:39:31.499 --> 02:39:32.659]  Yeah, Curtis LeMay.
[02:39:33.219 --> 02:39:35.481]  And he was one of the leading generals at the time.
[02:39:35.541 --> 02:39:37.522]  He was, I think, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs.
[02:39:37.582 --> 02:39:39.223]  And they presented this to John Kennedy.
[02:39:39.901 --> 02:39:41.522]  And this is after the Bay of Pigs.
[02:39:41.903 --> 02:39:46.526]  This is before, obviously, before Kennedy pissed off the wrong people and got assassinated.
[02:39:47.647 --> 02:39:51.410]  But they presented this to him and Kennedy said, no, you out of your mind.
[02:39:52.214 --> 02:39:59.536]  That's when he fired a bunch of them, and he also fired the director of the CIA, and then about a year later they blew his head up like a shotgun to a pumpkin.
[02:40:00.216 --> 02:40:00.936]  No, I totally agree.
[02:40:00.956 --> 02:40:02.036]  Let's take some calls here.
[02:40:02.997 --> 02:40:05.717]  Before we do that, just briefly, what's your prediction for the election?
[02:40:05.737 --> 02:40:10.198]  I mean, do you think, I mean, we know 35% of the country's got these new machines in place.
[02:40:10.478 --> 02:40:12.479]  Will that be enough to swing it, or what's going to happen?
[02:40:13.259 --> 02:40:17.360]  I hate making political predictions, and for the obvious reasons.
[02:40:19.291 --> 02:40:23.574]  If America's had enough, then we'll get rid of these Republicans.
[02:40:23.654 --> 02:40:34.064]  Now the sad fact is, we'll have to replace them with Democrats, but there's a good chance to stop this Republican machine, put Democrats in, and then purge the party.
[02:40:34.384 --> 02:40:37.446]  Go for third party, go for Democrats who are real Democrats.
[02:40:38.267 --> 02:40:41.790]  I think there's a chance that the Democrats will get the House and the Senate.
[02:40:41.890 --> 02:40:42.451]  If they don't,
[02:40:42.782 --> 02:40:43.602]  We know there's fraud.
[02:40:43.822 --> 02:40:48.504]  It's time to book reservations someplace, Alex.
[02:40:48.524 --> 02:40:50.325]  But like you, I'm going to stay here to the bitter end.
[02:40:50.365 --> 02:40:51.105]  I'm not going anywhere.
[02:40:52.066 --> 02:40:54.827]  Well, yeah, I mean, if we have the attitude of evacuating, they're going to win.
[02:40:54.867 --> 02:41:02.370]  But I mean, if Bush does start arresting people en masse and they start calling him dear leader, I'm going to punch the ejection seat for my family.
[02:41:03.090 --> 02:41:04.711]  Well, that's when I get out the oil and the
[02:41:10.692 --> 02:41:14.354]  Uh, the rub down cloths to make sure that my weapons are in excellent condition.
[02:41:16.075 --> 02:41:18.477]  And the Moloff cocktails, huh?
[02:41:18.517 --> 02:41:21.039]  Let's go ahead here and take a call.
[02:41:21.479 --> 02:41:22.660]  Tom in California.
[02:41:22.780 --> 02:41:23.901]  Tom, go ahead.
[02:41:23.921 --> 02:41:26.543]  You'd call one to tell a story about a SWAT team?
[02:41:27.481 --> 02:41:45.154]  Yeah, there was a woman in Eureka who, uh, she was grieving the anniversary of her son's death one year later, and I guess she was off her meds, she was upset, there was a welfare check done on her, and they called the SWAT team, and within an hour, she was even on the phone with a friend who was working with the SWAT team.
[02:41:45.194 --> 02:41:54.020]  A friend of hers was on a cell phone with her, and all she wanted was a pack of cigarettes, whatnot, and they made the guy hang up the phone.
[02:41:54.040 --> 02:41:55.901]  They stormed her apartment and shot her dead.
[02:41:55.961 --> 02:41:57.042]  They shot her nine times.
[02:41:57.967 --> 02:41:59.528]  These cops got off scot-free.
[02:42:00.369 --> 02:42:02.010]  They're all living in different states now.
[02:42:02.070 --> 02:42:06.753]  They couldn't even be contacted as witnesses for the coroner's inquest and whatnot.
[02:42:06.793 --> 02:42:10.576]  And even today's headline, Police Bullets Kill Eureka Teen.
[02:42:10.616 --> 02:42:13.038]  I guess a 15 or 16-year-old boy was shot.
[02:42:13.658 --> 02:42:17.441]  They came into his house on a probation check and they maced everybody.
[02:42:17.461 --> 02:42:19.122]  Well, it was probably with Al-Qaeda.
[02:42:19.642 --> 02:42:24.626]  They ought to just start lining everybody up against this wall and just shoot hundreds of us.
[02:42:24.706 --> 02:42:25.686]  It'll boost morale.
[02:42:26.989 --> 02:42:28.771]  Huge public executions.
[02:42:29.571 --> 02:42:32.073]  You guys have got me all fired up talking about 9-11.
[02:42:32.113 --> 02:42:34.655]  I want to tell you that I'm obsessed.
[02:42:34.815 --> 02:42:46.225]  You know, for the last couple years I've seen the videos, I've seen the articles, I've looked at the government story over and over and over and over again, and anybody who thinks that it wasn't an inside job has simply not done the research.
[02:42:46.805 --> 02:42:51.529]  I mean, just take a look at the fact that I get asked all the time, how could they have gotten bombs in the buildings?
[02:42:51.589 --> 02:42:56.253]  Well, Marvin Bush was the head of security and his cousin Walker, who is, you know, linked to
[02:42:57.324 --> 02:42:58.465]  Hitler, right?
[02:42:58.885 --> 02:42:59.265]  Walker?
[02:42:59.305 --> 02:43:00.686]  Well, it's the grandfather.
[02:43:00.706 --> 02:43:08.071]  Well, the whole Bush family has definite ties to the Hitler regime, going back to Prescott Bush at the beginning of World War II.
[02:43:08.111 --> 02:43:09.551]  We all know that, or we should know that.
[02:43:10.712 --> 02:43:16.696]  It seems like people... One of your calls was talking about, you know, what can you do to wake people up, and it seems like people
[02:43:18.137 --> 02:43:24.981]  We'll only wake up when these issues affect them directly, even though they don't realize that all these issues affect all of us directly.
[02:43:25.061 --> 02:43:26.162]  But I'll give you an example.
[02:43:26.182 --> 02:43:30.525]  I know several women who I've been trying to tell them for years about 9-11.
[02:43:30.565 --> 02:43:31.505]  They just won't listen.
[02:43:31.525 --> 02:43:35.788]  But then when they find out that the government wants to make abortion illegal, all of a sudden they're up in arms.
[02:43:35.868 --> 02:43:37.249]  And all of a sudden they're waking up to 9-11.
[02:43:37.549 --> 02:43:44.053]  It seems like unless these issues affect you directly, you're not going to pay attention.
[02:43:44.413 --> 02:43:44.874]  Hi, Harriet.
[02:43:44.914 --> 02:43:45.494]  Thanks for the call.
[02:43:46.187 --> 02:43:48.569]  Yeah, that's what your caller said is very true.
[02:43:49.529 --> 02:43:51.590]  Who was it that said all politics is local?
[02:43:52.411 --> 02:43:59.275]  If it doesn't affect you directly, you start to think, Alex, that, well, it's just not that important.
[02:44:00.116 --> 02:44:06.059]  Anyone who doesn't think that the destruction of Habeas Corpus is important is a fool.
[02:44:06.179 --> 02:44:07.320]  Anyone who doesn't think
[02:44:08.155 --> 02:44:14.960]  That having wire-enclosed First Amendment zones isn't important is a moron.
[02:44:15.000 --> 02:44:18.042]  You know, this entire country used to be a First Amendment zone, Alex.
[02:44:18.062 --> 02:44:19.223]  You and I are not old enough.
[02:44:19.604 --> 02:44:21.285]  I mean, we're not so old we don't remember that.
[02:44:21.365 --> 02:44:23.246]  Oh, I remember it just six years ago.
[02:44:23.326 --> 02:44:24.127]  Yeah, no kidding.
[02:44:24.347 --> 02:44:36.316]  So, if people think that what the Bush crime family has done doesn't affect them directly today, this minute, right now, while your program is live, then they are willfully ignorant.
[02:44:36.824 --> 02:44:40.647]  And by the way, Mike, when you say Bush crime family, folks, we're not joking.
[02:44:40.827 --> 02:44:48.173]  Every single one of them is involved in robberies and drugs and SNLs and CIA.
[02:44:48.413 --> 02:44:50.735]  Prescott was the head Nazi bag man.
[02:44:50.775 --> 02:44:54.138]  I mean, they are like, they are a serious hardcore mafia.
[02:44:54.578 --> 02:44:56.660]  It is the no child left behind thing.
[02:44:57.062 --> 02:45:07.850]  Part of that was designed to help one of the Bush boys, was it Marvin, or whichever one was involved in Silverado, got some funding from the Saudis, like the Bush boys.
[02:45:07.890 --> 02:45:08.831]  Yeah, it's Jeb.
[02:45:10.052 --> 02:45:15.696]  Well, no, the one that has the educational software that's not worth the powder to blow it to hell.
[02:45:15.716 --> 02:45:16.417]  No, I know what it is.
[02:45:16.557 --> 02:45:18.638]  Jeb got in trouble because he bought it for the state.
[02:45:18.698 --> 02:45:19.279]  That's what it was.
[02:45:19.299 --> 02:45:19.779]  There you go.
[02:45:19.859 --> 02:45:21.340]  Yeah, I forget which one it is, yeah.
[02:45:21.640 --> 02:45:24.943]  Yeah, it's either Marvin or one of the Bush boys.
[02:45:25.376 --> 02:45:30.841]  But anytime these thugs get in trouble, they turn to the Saudis, and they get bailed out or they get money.
[02:45:30.881 --> 02:45:39.808]  And I would remind people, I don't need to on your program, but I'll just say it anyway, that 15 of the 19 bombers who did come to this country were Saudis.
[02:45:40.489 --> 02:45:43.972]  And these are Bush family business partners, for God's sake.
[02:45:44.032 --> 02:45:47.175]  Why is that so hard for people to get through their minds, Alex?
[02:45:47.791 --> 02:45:53.780]  That the Bush family has dealt with the Saudi Royals and the Bin Laden family for 50 years.
[02:45:53.800 --> 02:45:55.022]  That's right.
[02:45:55.162 --> 02:45:57.966]  Why can't Americans understand that?
[02:45:58.772 --> 02:46:00.012]  Well, they vacationed together.
[02:46:00.052 --> 02:46:08.174]  Remember when FBI agent Robert Wright was up there on C-SPAN, the National Press Club, and he said, I was given a letter, I'll be arrested if I tell you what I know.
[02:46:08.554 --> 02:46:09.534]  It's threatening to arrest me.
[02:46:09.614 --> 02:46:13.975]  All I can tell you is, quote, the Bush's vacation with the Bin Ladens.
[02:46:14.335 --> 02:46:15.695]  Yeah, well, there you go.
[02:46:15.795 --> 02:46:20.316]  And the answer to that, they say, well, now you can't hold us responsible for that.
[02:46:20.796 --> 02:46:22.917]  Osama Bin Laden had 15 brothers.
[02:46:25.985 --> 02:46:30.246]  So, you know, just because we vacation as a family doesn't mean we're attached to Osama bin Laden.
[02:46:30.646 --> 02:46:31.766]  I say bat squeeze.
[02:46:32.987 --> 02:46:37.048]  Even the Wall Street Journal a month before 9-11 said it was a horrible relationship.
[02:46:37.348 --> 02:46:37.928]  Well, sure it is.
[02:46:38.668 --> 02:46:43.749]  And the CIA folks, I mean, it looks like a duck, it walks like a duck, it's quacking.
[02:46:44.429 --> 02:46:45.389]  I mean, come on here.
[02:46:45.810 --> 02:46:47.590]  It's time to have roast duck.
[02:46:48.490 --> 02:46:49.070]  Exactly.
[02:46:49.090 --> 02:46:51.391]  Drew in Omaha, Nebraska.
[02:46:51.431 --> 02:46:52.031]  Thanks for holding.
[02:46:52.071 --> 02:46:52.371]  Welcome.
[02:46:52.958 --> 02:46:54.460]  Thank you, thank you for taking my call.
[02:46:54.761 --> 02:47:00.790]  Hey, um, I was gonna talk about something else, but since you're on the subject of 9-11, I guess I'll talk about that for a moment.
[02:47:01.151 --> 02:47:03.014]  Interesting thing, I, uh, was...
[02:47:03.564 --> 02:47:11.449]  I went to a conference here in Omaha, actually in Bellevue, where all the Air Force bases, they had a couple people from the 9-11 Commission come talk.
[02:47:11.969 --> 02:47:20.094]  Oh yeah, that weird meeting with all these CEOs, most of them out of the buildings, you know, out there meeting with Warren Buffett and Bush flies there later.
[02:47:20.134 --> 02:47:21.115]  I mean, this is creepy!
[02:47:21.695 --> 02:47:24.637]  It is, it is, it is, but it doesn't surprise me either.
[02:47:24.677 --> 02:47:30.561]  You know, they said post-Cold War there's more CIA agents at Austin than anywhere else in the world.
[02:47:31.790 --> 02:47:54.417]  It's interesting, but anywho, I was at this commission and the deal going on, and the two people talking were saying how the commission was set up to fail and yada yada yada, they didn't have proper funding, etc etc, and so I was able to ask them a question at the end, and I said, well based on all these shortcomings,
[02:47:55.374 --> 02:47:56.655]  What was it that you guys missed?
[02:47:56.735 --> 02:47:59.376]  I mean, there's all this, you know, erroneous evidence.
[02:47:59.636 --> 02:48:02.238]  You don't talk about Building 7 in the report, etc.
[02:48:02.258 --> 02:48:12.543]  And the lady says to me, with a straight face, we think we've done, you know, everything in our capabilities, and we don't think we've missed even one thing in the report.
[02:48:12.563 --> 02:48:19.767]  Yeah, so first they're whining because of criticism, because the whole thing's a joke and a fraud, appointed by Bush, not independent.
[02:48:20.087 --> 02:48:23.969]  First they're up there going, yeah, we had a few problems, and then she said they're absolutely perfect, huh?
[02:48:24.864 --> 02:48:27.767]  Yeah, so, it was just all interesting.
[02:48:27.807 --> 02:48:30.350]  You know, Alex, let me just add this real quick.
[02:48:30.370 --> 02:48:42.043]  What really gets me, they bring Quentin in to question him about his relationship with the, what's her name, the girl from Arkansas.
[02:48:43.285 --> 02:48:44.246]  And they put him under oath.
[02:48:44.266 --> 02:48:45.007]  Stay there, we gotta break.
[02:48:45.067 --> 02:48:45.267]  I'm back.
[02:48:49.068 --> 02:48:49.528]  It's here!
[02:48:49.749 --> 02:48:54.512]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:48:54.892 --> 02:49:02.578]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:49:03.238 --> 02:49:10.283]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:49:10.703 --> 02:49:17.568]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying,
[02:49:18.058 --> 02:49:22.100]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:49:22.420 --> 02:49:25.941]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:49:26.381 --> 02:49:28.282]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:49:28.642 --> 02:49:32.563]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:49:47.358 --> 02:49:48.399]  The War on Terrorism.
[02:49:48.719 --> 02:49:51.502]  Will it be fought overseas, or will it affect us here at home?
[02:49:51.783 --> 02:49:55.927]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[02:49:56.367 --> 02:49:57.188]  So what do you do?

[02:52:59.513 --> 02:53:05.215]  I was just going to say, when Bill Clinton was questioned about his relationship with Paula Jones, they put him under oath.
[02:53:20.720 --> 02:53:26.521]  When George Bush and Dick Cheney were summoned before the 9-11 Commission, they were not put under oath.
[02:53:26.861 --> 02:53:28.642]  What in the hell is that?
[02:53:28.962 --> 02:53:32.142]  And when Congress called them for the closed session, they weren't under oath.
[02:53:32.622 --> 02:53:33.483]  Right.
[02:53:33.603 --> 02:53:35.363]  I don't know.
[02:53:36.583 --> 02:53:38.664]  I'm starting to get real angry again, Alex.
[02:53:40.124 --> 02:53:42.204]  Well yeah, and plus you've been off the air a few weeks.
[02:53:42.364 --> 02:53:43.184]  I know, I know.
[02:53:43.224 --> 02:53:45.685]  I've had a chance to get my liver back in working order.
[02:53:46.301 --> 02:53:54.183]  You know, from all the bile, I've calmed down a little bit, but I get on here with you for 45 minutes and I'm ready to kick ass and take names again.
[02:53:54.203 --> 02:53:57.924]  That's right, and you'll be back syndicated, starting, coming out?
[02:53:57.964 --> 02:53:58.465]  Monday night.
[02:53:59.125 --> 02:53:59.685]  Monday night.
[02:53:59.865 --> 02:54:00.985]  Monday coming, the 30th.
[02:54:01.105 --> 02:54:03.286]  And that's called Nova M Network.
[02:54:03.426 --> 02:54:14.009]  Yeah, Nova, I'll tell you where it comes from, the founder, Shelly Drobny, his family is from Poland, and Nova M
[02:54:14.710 --> 02:54:16.470]  The M stands for a long Polish word.
[02:54:16.490 --> 02:54:19.571]  It was named the village in Poland that his grandparents were from.
[02:54:19.971 --> 02:54:20.571]  Hey, I like it.
[02:54:20.631 --> 02:54:21.291]  It's a neat name.
[02:54:21.591 --> 02:54:23.932]  Yeah, Nova M. And it's got kind of a cool sound to it.
[02:54:23.952 --> 02:54:26.692]  It sounds almost astrophysical.
[02:54:27.033 --> 02:54:27.373]  Sure.
[02:54:27.533 --> 02:54:28.733]  Let's take two quick calls.
[02:54:28.813 --> 02:54:30.133]  Paul and Matt, you're on the air.
[02:54:30.193 --> 02:54:30.553]  Go ahead.
[02:54:31.153 --> 02:54:31.613]  Hey, Alex.
[02:54:31.814 --> 02:54:32.114]  Hey, Mark.
[02:54:32.454 --> 02:54:40.995]  Hey, I was going to give you a word that you were trying to look for earlier when you were saying that you were being selfish to want to open the door for people.
[02:54:41.636 --> 02:54:43.916]  The word you were looking for was actually altruistic.
[02:54:44.426 --> 02:54:49.128]  Well, no, what I'm saying is that people that care about other people, instinctively, it's selfishness.
[02:54:49.368 --> 02:54:52.409]  When you want to be nice to everybody around you, it comes back to you.
[02:54:52.469 --> 02:54:53.650]  Other people are then nice.
[02:54:53.990 --> 02:54:55.971]  It's really something you do that's for yourself.
[02:54:56.251 --> 02:55:02.633]  Now, you don't consciously realize that, but it's good instincts to stand up against corruption was the point I was trying to make, but thank you.
[02:55:03.494 --> 02:55:05.334]  Yeah, so it's unselfish devotion.
[02:55:06.175 --> 02:55:07.175]  Sure, what else is on your mind?
[02:55:08.634 --> 02:55:10.556]  Not much, just wanted to try and help you.
[02:55:10.876 --> 02:55:11.096]  Thank you.
[02:55:11.116 --> 02:55:11.617]  Well, that's true.
[02:55:11.637 --> 02:55:12.517]  My grandmother taught me that.
[02:55:27.476 --> 02:55:28.697]  A church-going Baptist?
[02:55:29.597 --> 02:55:30.077]  I'm not.
[02:55:30.157 --> 02:55:33.839]  But I mean, that was one of the essential life lessons that she taught me.
[02:55:34.459 --> 02:55:37.200]  I wish I could live that way more than I do, Alex.
[02:55:37.720 --> 02:55:38.481]  Absolutely.
[02:55:38.801 --> 02:55:40.081]  You know, I'm just angry all the time.
[02:55:44.543 --> 02:55:46.965]  Hey Mike, I appreciate your show.
[02:55:47.045 --> 02:55:52.669]  Look, why do liberals continue to worship the Clintons despite the fact that they were hired by the CIA?
[02:55:52.729 --> 02:55:54.490]  You haven't heard me worship the Clintons, have you?
[02:55:54.530 --> 02:55:55.691]  Not you, not you, not you.
[02:55:55.711 --> 02:55:58.452]  I'm talking about most mainstream liberals out there.
[02:55:58.472 --> 02:55:58.913]  I have no idea.
[02:55:58.933 --> 02:56:02.595]  I mean, there's Ruy Posada, arms manufacturing, drug smuggling, Waco.
[02:56:02.855 --> 02:56:03.856]  I have no idea.
[02:56:04.116 --> 02:56:09.380]  And you specifically, do you think the Democrats are really going to do anything with the Military Commissions Act?
[02:56:09.400 --> 02:56:10.080]  Okay, thank you.
[02:56:10.240 --> 02:56:12.262]  Answer the question, Mike, sorry.
[02:56:12.842 --> 02:56:14.183]  Yeah, I think the Democrats would.
[02:56:15.660 --> 02:56:16.341]  Okay, thank you.
[02:56:16.401 --> 02:56:18.944]  Mike Malloy, we look forward to talking to you again in the future.
[02:56:18.964 --> 02:56:19.564]  All right, Alex.
[02:56:19.664 --> 02:56:20.445]  Take care, man.
[02:56:20.485 --> 02:56:21.426]  Keep your powder dry.
[02:56:21.506 --> 02:56:22.047]  We'll see ya.
[02:56:22.267 --> 02:56:23.188]  God bless you all.
[02:56:23.208 --> 02:56:23.889]  Have a nice day.
