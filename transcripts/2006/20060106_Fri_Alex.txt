[00:00:05.405 --> 00:00:06.045]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.705 --> 00:00:07.746]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.486 --> 00:00:09.586]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.246 --> 00:00:11.046]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.807 --> 00:00:12.727]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.367 --> 00:00:17.168]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.548 --> 00:00:21.669]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:22.409 --> 00:00:27.970]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:28.691 --> 00:00:32.312]  It is Friday, the 6th day of January 2006.
[00:00:35.538 --> 00:00:37.539]  And we're going to be live for the next three hours.
[00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:56.388]  We've got one of these former top CIA analysts coming on who will tell us how deadly Al-CIA is and how deadly bin Laden is and why we've been unable to capture him, why he's the foremost expert on Osama bin Laden.
[00:00:56.408 --> 00:01:03.551]  So maybe you can tell us why the Bushes vacation with the bin Ladens and why bin Laden is a CIA asset and a lot more.
[00:01:04.494 --> 00:01:06.935]  You know, I'm not going to talk about Ariel Sharon.
[00:01:06.955 --> 00:01:07.675]  Frankly, I really don't care.
[00:01:33.897 --> 00:01:34.898]  I'm going to be honest with you.
[00:01:34.918 --> 00:01:40.562]  The guy's a total and complete puppet like everybody else that's in control of major countries.
[00:01:40.782 --> 00:01:43.864]  I mean, obviously I'll talk some about it, but not that much.
[00:01:45.165 --> 00:01:46.026]  And why is that?
[00:01:46.086 --> 00:01:47.167]  Because it's a diversion.
[00:01:47.247 --> 00:01:48.548]  Yes, they say he's dead.
[00:01:49.765 --> 00:01:51.846]  Died, really, yesterday, brain dead.
[00:01:52.246 --> 00:01:53.006]  And we already knew that.
[00:01:53.046 --> 00:01:55.107]  We had that on prisonplanet.com last night.
[00:01:55.627 --> 00:01:59.348]  And then, ooh, World Tribune, a little mouthpiece, basically, of Israel.
[00:01:59.968 --> 00:02:02.529]  It's a front group for Israel in the Washington Times.
[00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:03.669]  That's public knowledge.
[00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:12.852]  They gave us the official Mossad report, basically, through them, that now they're ready to tell us that he's dead.
[00:02:13.833 --> 00:02:14.513]  And that's up on...
[00:02:15.194 --> 00:02:16.395]  That's up on the website.
[00:02:16.415 --> 00:02:18.237]  It is very suspicious how he died.
[00:02:18.557 --> 00:02:21.679]  He was obese at 77 years of age and very energetic.
[00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:24.582]  And had quite a career in the military.
[00:02:24.602 --> 00:02:27.304]  He was in the military and was 14 years old.
[00:02:27.564 --> 00:02:28.165]  Very interesting.
[00:02:30.786 --> 00:02:31.967]  He is dead now.
[00:02:31.987 --> 00:02:33.228]  I said I wouldn't talk about him.
[00:02:33.248 --> 00:02:34.289]  There is quite a bit to talk about him.
[00:02:34.589 --> 00:02:37.131]  How they drove him to the hospital that was far away.
[00:02:37.171 --> 00:02:38.332]  How they didn't fly him.
[00:02:38.772 --> 00:02:40.473]  How they put him on the wrong drugs.
[00:02:41.274 --> 00:02:45.217]  How he had the big stroke in the ambulance.
[00:02:45.317 --> 00:02:47.038]  And it sounds just like Ishaq Rabin.
[00:02:47.078 --> 00:02:48.339]  That's what Barry Homish is saying.
[00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:49.600]  We need to get him back on.
[00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:50.881]  We'll get him on next week if we can.
[00:02:52.865 --> 00:02:54.046]  And why do they want to kill him?
[00:02:54.066 --> 00:02:55.467]  To put even more hardliners in.
[00:02:55.507 --> 00:02:58.709]  Plus, he was just about to be indicted for $3 million in bribes.
[00:02:58.749 --> 00:03:03.373]  That was already in mainstream news, and so now everybody will feel sorry for him and others in the Knesset.
[00:03:03.413 --> 00:03:05.054]  It'll just kind of all be shut down.
[00:03:05.955 --> 00:03:07.476]  My instincts tell me they killed him.
[00:03:08.436 --> 00:03:10.118]  Frankly, it sounds like they had trouble killing him.
[00:03:10.138 --> 00:03:14.841]  The guy was like a horse, and that he's really not dead, and they're going to kill him now.
[00:03:14.861 --> 00:03:17.183]  He's almost brain dead, and
[00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:20.222]  And they don't say how, you know, they unplugged him.
[00:03:20.282 --> 00:03:23.706]  It's just, at least as of a few minutes ago, it's just, he's gone now.
[00:03:24.587 --> 00:03:29.652]  He was brain dead and his son's there and we don't, very, very suspicious.
[00:03:29.692 --> 00:03:32.135]  But who knows, he may have had a stroke and
[00:03:33.467 --> 00:03:34.048]  Sure he did.
[00:03:34.768 --> 00:03:35.148]  Who knows?
[00:03:35.168 --> 00:03:35.829]  The world will never know.
[00:03:35.869 --> 00:03:36.610]  It really doesn't matter.
[00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:37.270]  The guy's a puppet.
[00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:45.437]  And then there's the bizarre statements of Pat Robertson that's even got the ADL after him now saying that God cursed Ariel Sharon for dividing Israel.
[00:03:45.877 --> 00:03:49.039]  And that God says anybody that divides Israel will basically be destroyed.
[00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:54.624]  Funny, I thought God said that Israel isn't allowed to be united until the Messiah comes and
[00:03:55.353 --> 00:04:00.378]  Well, Israel doesn't think the Messiah's come, and Christians say the Messiah's going to come back a second time.
[00:04:00.418 --> 00:04:05.202]  So any way you cut it, Israel is not supposed to be there right now.
[00:04:05.522 --> 00:04:12.869]  Jews are supposed to be there, living in harmony with the Palestinians, the Muslims, as they always have, really, until modern history.
[00:04:13.369 --> 00:04:18.174]  And that's what a lot of the actual, actually a large portion of true conservative Orthodox Jews say that.
[00:04:18.214 --> 00:04:21.637]  But, hey, you know, who are the American people for the facts, you know?
[00:04:22.654 --> 00:04:26.236]  I mean, Jeremiah, Joshua, all those guys said, you're going to go into captivity.
[00:04:26.256 --> 00:04:27.176]  You're going to be enslaved.
[00:04:27.196 --> 00:04:27.936]  You've been bad.
[00:04:28.296 --> 00:04:29.597]  You haven't followed the commandments.
[00:04:30.317 --> 00:04:31.398]  You're going to go into bondage.
[00:04:31.498 --> 00:04:36.180]  I guess Pat Robertson will tell God that God's bad.
[00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:38.380]  I mean, really, because that's what God says.
[00:04:40.308 --> 00:04:42.170]  Now we're going to get into a theological debate about it.
[00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:42.751]  I don't want to do it.
[00:04:42.771 --> 00:04:44.433]  You know, I said I wasn't going to get into that.
[00:04:44.954 --> 00:04:52.803]  The big news is right here in my hand, and believe me, it dwarfs by about a million times the death of Ariel Sharon.
[00:04:52.823 --> 00:04:58.610]  And we shall transmit that information worldwide when we get back.
[00:05:01.224 --> 00:05:08.049]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[00:05:08.369 --> 00:05:09.750]  That's right folks, DVD.
[00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:12.131]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[00:05:12.291 --> 00:05:14.393]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[00:05:14.653 --> 00:05:19.596]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[00:05:19.916 --> 00:05:23.879]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[00:05:24.199 --> 00:05:25.981]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[00:05:26.061 --> 00:05:36.710]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plannable microchips, and much, much more.
[00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:38.752]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[00:05:38.972 --> 00:05:42.816]  Order your copy on VHS or DVD today and man the guns of the Infowar.
[00:05:42.916 --> 00:05:44.497]  Order right now by calling 1-888-2533-139.

[00:06:00.839 --> 00:06:02.460]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:06.704]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[00:06:06.844 --> 00:06:09.706]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[00:06:09.806 --> 00:06:16.512]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[00:06:16.712 --> 00:06:19.714]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[00:06:19.914 --> 00:06:22.296]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[00:06:22.436 --> 00:06:30.323]  Black Berkey elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as
[00:06:30.603 --> 00:06:30.963]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:06:31.023 --> 00:06:32.565]  Or order on the web at BerkeyWater.com.
[00:07:01.297 --> 00:07:05.661]  Did you know that heart disease is the number one killer of men and women in the United States?
[00:07:06.122 --> 00:07:12.588]  In fact, the National Cholesterol Education Program has reported that each year more than a million Americans have heart attacks.
[00:07:13.072 --> 00:07:15.213]  And about a half a million die from heart disease.
[00:07:15.633 --> 00:07:21.634]  Did you also know that the higher your blood cholesterol level, the greater your risk for developing heart disease or having a heart attack?
[00:07:22.195 --> 00:07:41.540]  At ResearchedHerbs.com, we are aware of the controversies surrounding the presumed safety of statin drugs in lowering cholesterol, which is why, as part of our ongoing commitment to your safety and health, we invite you to learn more about Google by Himalaya, a highly effective and extremely safe natural herbal supplement, widely recognized for its cholesterol-regulating properties.
[00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:48.023]  At researchedherbs.com, we work hard to empower you with the resources you need to make informed health decisions.
[00:07:48.403 --> 00:07:51.985]  Visit us online at researchedherbs.com or call 1-800-845-3841 for more information.
[00:07:52.105 --> 00:07:52.305]  That's 1-800-845-3841.
[00:08:00.865 --> 00:08:08.610]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show, because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:08.950 --> 00:08:21.798]  All right, it's Friday, eight minutes into this first hour of transmission, second segment, Infowars.com, presentplanet.com on the websites.
[00:08:22.519 --> 00:08:27.942]  It's not about left and right, it's about right and wrong, it's about defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[00:08:27.982 --> 00:08:30.164]  We've all sworn oaths to the Constitution.
[00:08:30.916 --> 00:08:37.619]  If we love America, in our hearts we have, and our military and our police have done it publicly, and so have our government servants.
[00:08:38.359 --> 00:08:48.264]  Notice they started calling themselves officials, authorities, and now we're living in more and more tyranny, but they are still public servants, serving at our pleasure.
[00:08:48.584 --> 00:08:49.444]  They work for us.
[00:08:49.504 --> 00:08:53.606]  I know you don't like hearing it, some of you bureaucrats out there, but that's a fact.
[00:08:55.040 --> 00:09:12.732]  We have the author of Imperial Hubris, Why the West is Losing the War on Terror, coming on, and one of the chief, or the chief CIA expert on Al-Qaeda and Osama al-Qaeda bin Laden Busha.
[00:09:13.579 --> 00:09:35.164]  And so, he will be on in the next hour if he shows up for the interview, and I do intend to grill, as they say, because, or maybe he's a nice guy, maybe he'll be honest about things, like the last CIA agent, the chief commander of CIA operations in Afghanistan, admitting that our government carried out terrorist attacks to blame it on Iran.
[00:09:36.265 --> 00:09:38.445]  By the way, we haven't written an article about that yet.
[00:09:38.945 --> 00:09:42.106]  I haven't even had time to call Paul Watson in the last two days to tell him, hey,
[00:09:43.147 --> 00:09:43.788]  I think we're good to go.
[00:09:59.751 --> 00:10:03.615]  Oh, what's the term that would be proper to use?
[00:10:03.635 --> 00:10:06.058]  You know, teaming up.
[00:10:06.118 --> 00:10:07.359]  But we collaborate.
[00:10:07.399 --> 00:10:08.821]  Yes, we're collaborators.
[00:10:08.881 --> 00:10:12.405]  We tend to have a bad connotation.
[00:10:13.506 --> 00:10:14.427]  Oh, the resistance.
[00:10:14.507 --> 00:10:15.688]  Collaborating with the resistance.
[00:10:17.981 --> 00:10:18.902]  We're good to go.
[00:10:40.132 --> 00:10:41.294]  Is that constitutional?
[00:10:41.574 --> 00:10:43.217]  Historically, is this a good sign?
[00:10:43.517 --> 00:10:49.325]  No, it's not, and I'm against it, and I don't care who's pushing it, whether it's my grandma or George Bush or Bill Clinton.
[00:10:50.786 --> 00:11:03.691]  So we'll have Imperial Hubris author coming up, and also Libertarian Party leader from New Hampshire coming on, introducing a bill that it'll be a felony of the police engaged in mass gun confiscations, or if the military does it.
[00:11:04.051 --> 00:11:09.173]  It was ruled to be illegal in New Orleans, but it didn't matter when the federal judge said don't do it.
[00:11:09.193 --> 00:11:11.914]  They just kept doing it, and nobody's gotten their guns back.
[00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:14.040]  It's been judged.
[00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:14.680]  You're criminals.
[00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:15.781]  Do you understand that?
[00:11:16.121 --> 00:11:20.882]  But you don't care because you work for a criminal executive that says it's above the law.
[00:11:21.222 --> 00:11:24.043]  Doesn't matter if it's a felony to spy on the American people, you're going to do it.
[00:11:24.343 --> 00:11:27.324]  Doesn't matter if it's a felony to manufacture fake intelligence, you're going to do it.
[00:11:27.784 --> 00:11:33.966]  Doesn't matter if it's, even under the Patriot Act, a serious terrorist felony to create evidence of a fake terror attack.
[00:11:34.006 --> 00:11:34.866]  That's a terroristic threat.
[00:11:36.121 --> 00:11:38.822]  With the intention to create terror.
[00:11:38.842 --> 00:11:40.223]  No, no, no.
[00:11:40.323 --> 00:11:41.583]  All those fake terror alerts.
[00:11:41.683 --> 00:11:43.364]  Ari Fleischer, before he resigned, admitted.
[00:11:43.684 --> 00:11:46.625]  Kind of choked up and said, yes, they're fake terror alerts for political aims.
[00:11:47.106 --> 00:11:49.567]  I couldn't believe when he just said it on national TV.
[00:11:50.267 --> 00:11:51.928]  They said, isn't this really political?
[00:11:52.028 --> 00:11:52.828]  We've been getting leaks.
[00:11:52.888 --> 00:11:53.948]  Well, yes, it's political.
[00:11:54.809 --> 00:11:58.690]  So, it's all criminal, it's all terroristic, and Bush is not a conservative.
[00:11:59.230 --> 00:12:00.431]  So, that said...
[00:12:01.750 --> 00:12:07.612]  Ariel Sharon is dead, and I'll talk a little bit about that, but frankly, it doesn't amount to a hell of beans.
[00:12:09.213 --> 00:12:10.473]  It does not amount to a hell of beans.
[00:12:10.493 --> 00:12:19.756]  The guy was a complete and total puppet for his entire life, and he was there all through Israel's history.
[00:12:19.776 --> 00:12:28.739]  When he was 14 years old, a decade before Israel even became Israel, he was part of the Jewish militia.
[00:12:29.614 --> 00:12:37.803]  That, quite frankly, admittedly carried out terrorist bombings against the Palestinians and against the British.
[00:12:39.216 --> 00:12:41.958]  But I don't know what you can say about Ariel Sharon.
[00:12:42.598 --> 00:12:54.946]  It's just that he was a seminal individual in the state of Israel from the time he was 14 years old until they pulled the plug on him, I guess, today at 77 years of age.
[00:12:54.986 --> 00:12:56.767]  And there is some evidence it was foul play.
[00:12:56.787 --> 00:12:59.508]  I mean, that's even in mainstream news articles today.
[00:12:59.528 --> 00:13:03.471]  So I think the New York Times is criticizing how it was handled.
[00:13:03.511 --> 00:13:06.873]  It's pretty obvious that he was kind of given a Princess Diana ride
[00:13:07.753 --> 00:13:09.935]  Some people are hard to kill.
[00:13:10.615 --> 00:13:13.777]  Most people that obese at 77 aren't alive, folks.
[00:13:13.797 --> 00:13:17.299]  You'd want to think that's what caused it, but the guy was a horse.
[00:13:17.819 --> 00:13:20.161]  Very, very good constitution.
[00:13:20.899 --> 00:13:24.822]  You know, physical constitution, and it's very suspicious.
[00:13:25.262 --> 00:13:27.544]  Looks like a Yishak Rabin situation.
[00:13:27.824 --> 00:13:34.669]  By the way, also, Pat Robertson saying that it looks like Sharon was cursed for dividing Israel.
[00:13:35.029 --> 00:13:36.370]  That whole thing is smoke and mirrors, folks.
[00:13:36.390 --> 00:13:37.651]  That's not even real what's happening.
[00:13:37.871 --> 00:13:43.515]  You know, they drag out a few villagers and a few small villages for the world to then get sympathy to not divide Israel.
[00:13:44.095 --> 00:13:47.117]  So, and the bootlicking...
[00:13:48.462 --> 00:13:51.925]  Phony conservative, phony Christian, Big Brother's here to help you.
[00:13:53.126 --> 00:13:56.208]  Flashing El Diablo sign on 700 Club.
[00:13:56.548 --> 00:14:00.331]  Pat Robertson even said, yeah, and Yishak Rabin got killed, too.
[00:14:00.371 --> 00:14:01.372]  He got cursed, too.
[00:14:01.392 --> 00:14:04.635]  Yeah, he got cursed by Shin Bet.
[00:14:06.983 --> 00:14:08.183]  I mean, come on.
[00:14:08.203 --> 00:14:17.566]  Netanyahu, two nights before, is calling Yishak Rabin Hitler and calling for him to be killed, and then he is killed, and clearly it isn't the guy that they showed shooting him.
[00:14:17.806 --> 00:14:20.907]  Clearly he got put in the car and got shot in the car, just like Ronald Reagan.
[00:14:23.007 --> 00:14:24.507]  And the doctors have said that, by the way.
[00:14:24.547 --> 00:14:25.548]  That is documented.
[00:14:25.628 --> 00:14:27.688]  I mean, they killed Yishak Rabin.
[00:14:27.948 --> 00:14:30.489]  There are no two ways about it.
[00:14:31.670 --> 00:14:35.793]  I keep saying I'm not going to talk about it, and I talked about it in the first segment, and now I'm rattling on about it.
[00:14:35.873 --> 00:14:37.054]  Here's the huge news.
[00:14:37.094 --> 00:14:38.876]  This is big news.
[00:14:38.916 --> 00:14:42.398]  This is going to affect your pension fund massively.
[00:14:42.899 --> 00:14:50.885]  This is going to affect Social Security in a gargantuan, colossal, mountainous, towering way.
[00:14:51.545 --> 00:14:52.346]  This is earth-shattering.
[00:14:53.015 --> 00:14:53.695]  Shattering.
[00:14:53.775 --> 00:14:56.997]  This really shows us where things are going.
[00:14:57.717 --> 00:15:02.079]  And you're going to see a few news articles about it, maybe a mention on Lou Dobbs' Money Report.
[00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:03.080]  But that's about it.
[00:15:03.880 --> 00:15:08.102]  And people should be running around the streets, freaking out right now about their futures.
[00:15:08.142 --> 00:15:08.562]  But they're not.
[00:15:08.602 --> 00:15:09.963]  They're all over the place.
[00:15:10.003 --> 00:15:11.884]  I went to a business meeting last night at a restaurant.
[00:15:12.784 --> 00:15:13.585]  I went walking in.
[00:15:14.509 --> 00:15:15.509]  And I'm like, hey, how you doing?
[00:15:15.549 --> 00:15:16.750]  To the person that was going to see this.
[00:15:17.150 --> 00:15:18.150]  I'm doing real good.
[00:15:18.190 --> 00:15:19.031]  My team won.
[00:15:19.451 --> 00:15:20.111]  Oh, that's nice.
[00:15:20.131 --> 00:15:22.232]  And they started trying to tell me about how wonderful Vince Young was.
[00:15:22.632 --> 00:15:23.272]  I said, thank you.
[00:15:23.312 --> 00:15:24.352]  Yes, very nice game.
[00:15:24.392 --> 00:15:25.933]  Yes, very, very good.
[00:15:26.673 --> 00:15:28.034]  And I tried to be polite.
[00:15:28.094 --> 00:15:29.774]  And the person comes over to talk at the table.
[00:15:30.254 --> 00:15:31.255]  Starts talking about that.
[00:15:31.295 --> 00:15:32.555]  And I'm just, thank you very much.
[00:15:32.575 --> 00:15:33.535]  And finally, I just said, you know what?
[00:15:33.935 --> 00:15:38.657]  I wish we could be celebrating out in the streets that we defeated the fascist police state that's taking over.
[00:15:39.389 --> 00:15:46.171]  Well, I wish I could be celebrating that the dollar hadn't plunged by 45% and that my meager bank accounts hadn't been debased by 45%.
[00:15:46.911 --> 00:15:53.374]  And the person, you know, the waiter didn't even know what currency is.
[00:15:53.634 --> 00:15:55.094]  They didn't even know what that word meant.
[00:15:55.134 --> 00:15:57.715]  They didn't even know what it means to have a debased currency.
[00:15:59.381 --> 00:16:05.563]  I mean, something a poor Mexican immigrant knows, because they're ten times smarter than the average drooling, fat, dumb, and happy American.
[00:16:05.603 --> 00:16:08.303]  I mean, I've talked to illegal aliens about it that speak English.
[00:16:08.383 --> 00:16:09.804]  Oh, yes, the dollar is weaker now.
[00:16:09.864 --> 00:16:11.384]  Not as good in Mexico anymore.
[00:16:11.404 --> 00:16:12.284]  Boy, it's hurting us.
[00:16:12.564 --> 00:16:16.745]  They know, but not some yuppie college student who's bussing tables.
[00:16:18.066 --> 00:16:19.926]  But they know all about Vince Young, man.
[00:16:21.686 --> 00:16:22.907]  I'm really getting sick of it.
[00:16:23.187 --> 00:16:24.007]  You want to know why?
[00:16:24.027 --> 00:16:28.068]  Because I can't have a conversation with anybody in Austin, Texas about any serious issue.
[00:16:28.869 --> 00:16:33.150]  I mean, if you wanted to talk five minutes about football, frankly, I like football.
[00:16:33.170 --> 00:16:34.170]  You want to really get down to it.
[00:16:34.370 --> 00:16:35.911]  But I will not allow myself to watch it.
[00:16:36.111 --> 00:16:38.551]  I will not allow myself to be part of it because it is our God.
[00:16:38.571 --> 00:16:40.332]  Do you know what an idol is, folks?
[00:16:42.612 --> 00:16:44.793]  Oh, I haven't told you the earth-shattering news yet.
[00:16:44.813 --> 00:16:45.993]  Well, you know, maybe I won't.
[00:16:46.053 --> 00:16:47.414]  Maybe we shouldn't even cover it.
[00:16:47.434 --> 00:16:48.214]  Maybe I'm wrong.
[00:16:48.234 --> 00:16:49.174]  Maybe you don't want to know.
[00:16:49.853 --> 00:16:51.836]  Come on, let's talk about the Rose Bowl.
[00:16:52.077 --> 00:16:53.879]  Man, he's got an arm, he's got legs.
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:57.345]  Did you see him run that in with 46 seconds on the clock?
[00:16:57.585 --> 00:16:59.068]  The last play, they could have done it.
[00:16:59.388 --> 00:17:01.431]  And then they got the two-point conversion.
[00:17:02.293 --> 00:17:02.894]  Yes, they did.
[00:17:04.054 --> 00:17:06.718]  And boy, I tell you, UCLA had just gotten too arrogant.
[00:17:07.058 --> 00:17:13.887]  And in their backyard, right there in their town, boy, Texas hadn't had a championship since 1970.
[00:17:14.307 --> 00:17:16.110]  And man, I'm feeling good right now.
[00:17:16.670 --> 00:17:21.697]  I'm associating my whole life with a football team that doesn't amount to a hill of beans.
[00:17:22.277 --> 00:17:23.879]  I don't care if I'm turning into a slave.
[00:17:23.919 --> 00:17:25.281]  I don't care if I don't have a future.
[00:17:25.541 --> 00:17:27.463]  I don't care what I got and what's happening.
[00:17:27.703 --> 00:17:30.386]  I don't care if they're building concentration camps all over America.
[00:17:30.667 --> 00:17:32.849]  I don't care if they're putting cancer viruses in vaccines.
[00:17:33.090 --> 00:17:34.811]  I don't care if they're kidnapping children.
[00:17:35.052 --> 00:17:37.735]  I don't care what the government's doing because I got my horns.
[00:17:38.295 --> 00:17:40.136]  And I'm feeling real good right now.
[00:17:40.797 --> 00:17:42.418]  Oh, I'm feeling real good.
[00:17:42.438 --> 00:17:44.479]  Everybody's walking around smiling in Austin.
[00:17:44.539 --> 00:17:46.000]  Oh, everybody's feeling real good.
[00:17:46.020 --> 00:17:47.221]  There's burn-ons everywhere.
[00:17:47.421 --> 00:17:51.904]  Even people I know, people that know I can't stand it, walk up to me and start telling me about it.
[00:17:52.064 --> 00:17:53.505]  Listen, don't tell me about it anymore.
[00:17:53.525 --> 00:17:54.545]  Do you understand me?
[00:17:55.966 --> 00:17:56.667]  Well, what's wrong with you?
[00:17:56.687 --> 00:17:58.968]  You're just not happy that our team won.
[00:17:59.188 --> 00:18:00.089]  It doesn't matter.
[00:18:00.109 --> 00:18:02.771]  There's children in slave camps right now being raped.
[00:18:03.451 --> 00:18:06.173]  While you idiots walk around acting like a bunch of fools.
[00:18:07.083 --> 00:18:11.006]  If you spent five minutes a week on football or watched a game every once in a while, it would be different.
[00:18:11.126 --> 00:18:18.351]  But you people literally do nothing but a bunch of brainwashed body snatchers walking around mumbling about the UK football team.
[00:18:21.033 --> 00:18:22.914]  So maybe I shouldn't get into the news today.
[00:18:22.934 --> 00:18:24.315]  Maybe I shouldn't talk about it.
[00:18:24.335 --> 00:18:32.661]  Maybe I should just get on the air and I could just go swill beer and be a sports broadcaster and sit up there and talk about the teams all day.
[00:18:33.852 --> 00:18:50.857]  Maybe I could just, you know, maybe I could be the modern American, divorce my wife, go out and marry three or four times, and just polish my car and wax it and go around like a preening peacock and spend two hours a day in the gym and, you know, try to hang out with the cool people and just take care of my... But you know what?
[00:18:50.877 --> 00:18:51.977]  I wouldn't be a happy person.
[00:18:51.997 --> 00:18:55.678]  I'd be like some of you out there, a bunch of soulless jellyfish.
[00:18:57.336 --> 00:18:58.737]  Instead, I am alive.
[00:18:58.977 --> 00:19:00.379]  My life is dynamic.
[00:19:00.679 --> 00:19:01.800]  I'm affecting change.
[00:19:01.860 --> 00:19:02.520]  I'm involved.
[00:19:02.961 --> 00:19:06.944]  I am involved in history, along with millions of other Americans and human beings that love freedom.
[00:19:06.964 --> 00:19:13.109]  You know, when Karl Rove told the New York Times that all of us are just spectators, they're participants in history.
[00:19:13.329 --> 00:19:14.050]  They're involved.
[00:19:14.090 --> 00:19:15.451]  It's a big joke to them.
[00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:19.921]  They'll play along and act like they're into all of it and make little jokes.
[00:19:20.921 --> 00:19:28.363]  It was like when I was watching Armitage and Negroponte when they would testify about all their evil activities or be questioned in different hearings.
[00:19:28.523 --> 00:19:32.204]  They always bring up basketball or baseball or football to disarm right up front.
[00:19:32.244 --> 00:19:34.884]  It's just a propaganda, just a jab at you.
[00:19:35.645 --> 00:19:36.365]  That's all it is.
[00:19:36.445 --> 00:19:37.465]  Roman diversions.
[00:19:38.792 --> 00:19:39.252]  So, you know what?
[00:19:39.292 --> 00:19:40.813]  I'm just not going to cover it then.
[00:19:41.193 --> 00:19:43.153]  I'm not going to tell you the earth-shattering news.
[00:19:43.213 --> 00:19:44.394]  We are going... That's it.
[00:19:44.414 --> 00:19:45.614]  I'm canceling the guest today.
[00:19:45.974 --> 00:19:46.815]  Let's talk football.
[00:19:46.895 --> 00:19:47.535]  Come on, let's do it.
[00:19:47.975 --> 00:19:49.956]  Come on, let's talk about Vince Young.
[00:19:50.136 --> 00:19:57.058]  Let's just talk about him and talk about him and talk about him and talk about him and talk about him and we can all be homeless and talk about him.
[00:20:01.977 --> 00:20:08.341]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[00:20:08.561 --> 00:20:13.565]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using the Rife frequency technology.
[00:20:13.885 --> 00:20:21.810]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:20:21.950 --> 00:20:28.995]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:20:29.215 --> 00:20:30.416]  There are no side effects.
[00:20:30.576 --> 00:20:33.959]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[00:20:34.020 --> 00:20:35.141]  Don't just treat symptoms.
[00:20:35.421 --> 00:20:36.702]  Eliminate the cause.
[00:20:36.902 --> 00:20:43.749]  BioSolutions has over 550 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[00:20:43.849 --> 00:20:46.311]  Customer satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.

[00:20:50.473 --> 00:20:51.373]  Here it is, folks, the 2006 Red Book.

[00:22:12.489 --> 00:22:19.994]  The revolutionary Berkey Light with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:22:20.314 --> 00:22:23.457]  Harmful or unwanted chemicals are reduced to below detectable levels.
[00:22:23.737 --> 00:22:29.483]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving the nutritional minerals your body needs.
[00:22:29.763 --> 00:22:35.909]  Made of durable Lexan, the material used in making bulletproof glass, the system is durable, rugged, and yet attractive.
[00:22:36.269 --> 00:22:40.171]  The Berkey light is transparent, so there is no guesswork when refilling the system.

[00:23:54.846 --> 00:23:55.906]  No purchase necessary to win.
[00:23:55.926 --> 00:23:57.286]  Not open to current GCN sponsors.
[00:23:57.346 --> 00:23:58.807]  Odds of winning are dependent on the number of entries.
[00:23:58.847 --> 00:23:59.387]  Contest ends 13106.
[00:24:07.457 --> 00:24:09.199]  I got a star on my car.
[00:24:09.299 --> 00:24:10.560]  Okay, here's the big news.
[00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:12.281]  And I apologize, folks.
[00:24:12.321 --> 00:24:13.862]  I'm not going to talk about UT football.
[00:24:13.882 --> 00:24:21.168]  I'm not going to talk about tiddlywinks or how many lichen funguses grow on the back of a rock.
[00:24:21.248 --> 00:24:22.529]  I'm just not going to do it.
[00:24:23.049 --> 00:24:29.114]  I'm going to talk about the systematic destruction of the underpinning of our entire financial system by design.
[00:24:29.835 --> 00:24:30.556]  How does that sound?
[00:24:30.596 --> 00:24:31.537]  You want to know about that?
[00:24:31.577 --> 00:24:32.999]  Or maybe you want to escape.
[00:24:33.039 --> 00:24:33.900]  Well, you don't escape.
[00:24:33.940 --> 00:24:39.447]  When you try to escape into escapism and that's all you do, you end up broke on the street, folks.
[00:24:40.896 --> 00:24:42.717]  I mean, America's all about escape now.
[00:24:42.737 --> 00:24:45.319]  I even hear ads about, come into our topless bar and escape.
[00:24:45.579 --> 00:24:47.040]  Go to a football game and escape.
[00:24:47.100 --> 00:24:49.261]  Come to the Dale Diamond and escape.
[00:24:50.622 --> 00:24:53.444]  Escape, escape, escape, escape, escape, escape, escape, escape.
[00:24:53.684 --> 00:25:08.233]  And some escapism is healthy, but when you totally try to escape, I guess you just sit in a chair and imagine that your house is a palatial beach, and then six months later you'll just be sitting there with a long beard being evicted from the chair.
[00:25:09.897 --> 00:25:11.078]  All right, I'm ranting.
[00:25:11.118 --> 00:25:11.658]  I'm sorry.
[00:25:12.278 --> 00:25:17.561]  China signals switch in reserves away from the dollar.
[00:25:19.002 --> 00:25:29.467]  China indicated on Thursday it could begin to diversify its rapidly growing foreign exchange reserves away from the U.S.
[00:25:29.547 --> 00:25:38.232]  dollar and government bonds, a potential shift with significant implications for global financial and commodity markets.
[00:25:39.386 --> 00:25:44.629]  Economists estimate that more than 70% of the reserves are invested in U.S.
[00:25:44.689 --> 00:25:48.691]  dollar assets, which has helped to sustain the recent large U.S.
[00:25:48.751 --> 00:25:49.312]  deficits.
[00:25:49.952 --> 00:26:06.842]  If China were to stop acquiring such a large proportion of dollars, with its reserves currently accumulating about $15 billion a month, or $12.4 billion, it could put heavy downward pressure on the greenback.
[00:26:07.728 --> 00:26:11.271]  That means you know how they are in Mexico where their money's worthless?
[00:26:12.112 --> 00:26:16.516]  See, you get to Germany with the wheelbarrows of money for bread?
[00:26:16.536 --> 00:26:17.757]  This is not good.
[00:26:17.798 --> 00:26:20.680]  I know you've got Vince Young.
[00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:22.362]  I understand.
[00:26:22.982 --> 00:26:24.203]  I'm very upset about this.
[00:26:24.263 --> 00:26:25.543]  I'm freaking out right now.
[00:26:25.623 --> 00:26:27.143]  It's actually happening.
[00:26:27.163 --> 00:26:30.044]  We're actually being gang-wraithed by the New World Order.
[00:26:30.264 --> 00:26:32.445]  They said they'd do it, but it doesn't matter.
[00:26:33.786 --> 00:26:38.147]  I'll just be like Woody Woodpecker and go bouncing down the street happily because Vince Young...
[00:26:39.310 --> 00:26:40.452]  UT Horns, baby!
[00:26:40.752 --> 00:26:41.713]  The greatest game ever!
[00:26:43.215 --> 00:26:57.012]  In a brief statement on its website, the government's foreign exchange regulator said one of its targets for 06 was to improve the operation and management of foreign exchange reserves and to actively explore more effective ways to utilize reserve assets in diversification.
[00:26:57.472 --> 00:26:57.592]  Page 2.
[00:27:16.687 --> 00:27:18.749]  And the macroeconomic adjustment.
[00:27:18.789 --> 00:27:22.071]  The announcement came from the State Administration of Foreign Exchange.
[00:27:22.672 --> 00:27:35.861]  It gave no details about whether this meant a big shift in the investment strategy for Chinese reserves, which according to local press reports reached nearly $800 billion at the end of last year and are expected by economists to reach $1 billion by year's end.
[00:27:35.881 --> 00:27:36.382]  20% increase each year.
[00:27:38.783 --> 00:27:46.829]  The regulator also said it would end quotas on the amount of foreign currency Chinese companies can acquire to invest in overseas assets, on and on and on.
[00:27:47.689 --> 00:27:50.011]  It has other indicators here.
[00:27:50.071 --> 00:27:51.372]  It's got John Snow, U.S.
[00:27:51.392 --> 00:28:01.298]  Treasury Secretary, speaking earlier about it, repeated his call for China to allow their currency to rise against the dollar.
[00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:07.943]  The trade deficit is influenced by lots of things, differential growth rates and just a bunch of mumbo-jumbo.
[00:28:08.803 --> 00:28:17.467]  Okay, now you notice the New York Times here says that, says that, oh, they're not saying it'll be a strong move.
[00:28:17.967 --> 00:28:23.969]  They've already made a huge move, what, eight months ago, into a basket of currencies.
[00:28:24.009 --> 00:28:24.609]  Now what is that?
[00:28:24.669 --> 00:28:31.072]  Before, about 90% of their investment was in the dollar, and in T-bills, treasury bills, U.S.
[00:28:31.172 --> 00:28:32.152]  debt, boys and girls.
[00:28:33.013 --> 00:28:36.574]  Now it is shifting predominantly,
[00:28:37.703 --> 00:28:40.515]  In its new acquisitions, that is, it still holds old ones.
[00:28:41.187 --> 00:28:43.727]  But it's like I'm no longer a Ford man, I'm now a Chevy man.
[00:28:43.787 --> 00:28:46.088]  Now, in the future, they're going to buy Chevy.
[00:28:46.108 --> 00:28:47.268]  They're going to buy EU.
[00:28:47.728 --> 00:28:48.968]  They're going to buy DNR.
[00:28:49.688 --> 00:28:52.669]  They're diversifying into a basket with U.S.
[00:28:52.709 --> 00:28:57.710]  currencies only being a small part of the overall index in future acquisitions.
[00:28:57.750 --> 00:29:09.592]  So in the last eight months or so, most of their new purchasing has been dramatically into everything from Russian currencies into Russian petrodollars, you name it.
[00:29:10.052 --> 00:29:10.673]  We're good to go.
[00:29:35.968 --> 00:29:38.050]  Let me talk a little bit more about basic economics.
[00:29:38.070 --> 00:29:39.391]  This is non-rocket science.
[00:29:39.411 --> 00:29:42.092]  They try to make it all mumbo-jumbo, confusing.
[00:29:42.473 --> 00:29:43.954]  Spend a few minutes on that on the other side.
[00:29:43.974 --> 00:29:47.456]  Get into Ariel Serrano, a bunch of other issues, and take your call.
[00:29:47.476 --> 00:29:47.917]  Stay with us.
[00:29:51.579 --> 00:29:52.480]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:54.581]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.502 --> 00:29:58.184]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.088 --> 00:30:06.531]  If you think your engine is safe by having the oil changed every 3,000 miles, think again.
[00:30:06.811 --> 00:30:10.394]  Every time you start your car, your engine creates friction between the moving parts.
[00:30:10.534 --> 00:30:18.680]  These moving parts wear against each other, and the result is small metal particles circulating through your oil, causing premature wear and damage to your engine.
[00:30:18.920 --> 00:30:24.544]  Oil filters do a good job of trapping the large metal particles, but they will not trap the most harmful tiny particles.
[00:30:24.844 --> 00:30:30.088]  These tiny particles circulate constantly through your oil, and over time your engine begins to show signs of wear.
[00:30:30.348 --> 00:30:32.430]  This is why you need the filter mag.
[00:30:32.710 --> 00:30:44.860]  The filter mag is a powerful magnet that holds itself to the outside of your oil filter, trapping the tiny metal particles to the inside wall of the filter, extending the life of your oil and ultimately extending the life of your engine.
[00:30:45.100 --> 00:30:49.503]  The reusable FilterMag is maintenance-free, installs in two seconds, and lasts forever.
[00:30:49.724 --> 00:30:50.684]  So what are you waiting for?
[00:30:50.864 --> 00:30:52.486]  Go to FilterMag.com.
[00:30:52.606 --> 00:30:54.407]  That's FilterMag.com.
[00:30:54.667 --> 00:30:55.128]  Or call 800-345-8376.
[00:30:55.148 --> 00:30:55.348]  That's 800-345-8376.
[00:31:02.461 --> 00:31:04.082]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:31:04.222 --> 00:31:08.345]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[00:31:08.465 --> 00:31:11.347]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[00:31:11.427 --> 00:31:18.091]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[00:31:18.311 --> 00:31:21.314]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[00:31:21.514 --> 00:31:23.897]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[00:31:24.057 --> 00:31:34.087]  Like murky elements, not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as aptazine, benzene, chloride, and chloroform.
[00:31:34.087 --> 00:31:36.888]  Or order on the web at BerkeyWater.com.
[00:32:02.407 --> 00:32:04.768]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[00:32:05.028 --> 00:32:08.849]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.
[00:32:09.189 --> 00:32:10.009]  Read the labels.
[00:32:10.430 --> 00:32:14.571]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[00:32:14.771 --> 00:32:18.972]  Also may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[00:32:19.332 --> 00:32:24.214]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[00:32:24.594 --> 00:32:28.176]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my Cal-Ben Pure Soap Shampoo.
[00:32:28.377 --> 00:32:33.720]  It's all natural, earth-friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[00:32:33.980 --> 00:32:36.722]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.
[00:32:37.022 --> 00:32:37.903]  So what are you waiting for?
[00:32:38.223 --> 00:32:48.950]  Call now, 1-800-340-7091 and find out how a family of four can save over $1,000 per year on all their cleaning products with Cal-Ben Pure Soaps.
[00:32:49.310 --> 00:32:50.571]  I've heard the little fable...
[00:33:16.215 --> 00:33:18.216]  The parable told two different ways.
[00:33:18.316 --> 00:33:23.497]  In one, there's a happy little kingdom, and an evil witch comes and poisons the well.
[00:33:24.377 --> 00:33:27.278]  Everybody drinks from it, and they become really hateful and evil.
[00:33:27.858 --> 00:33:32.139]  And the wise king, he goes and drinks from the well.
[00:33:32.179 --> 00:33:39.101]  He knows it's the well, and then he joins the hateful, evil kingdom, and now they're not going to basically outcast him.
[00:33:39.621 --> 00:33:41.202]  I don't know if that's the wise thing to do.
[00:33:41.742 --> 00:33:42.402]  I know it's not.
[00:33:43.211 --> 00:33:51.696]  And then the other way you can hear the parable of is there's a village, and there's a shoemaker, and the witch comes and poisons the well, and then his whole family becomes evil.
[00:33:51.716 --> 00:33:55.819]  Everybody becomes evil and hateful, and he just can't stand it, so he goes and drinks from the well.
[00:33:57.440 --> 00:33:59.642]  And I guess that's just what I should do.
[00:33:59.722 --> 00:34:07.467]  I should not talk about DynCorp and Halliburton openly with white slavery rings, publicly with lobbyists in D.C.
[00:34:07.947 --> 00:34:10.088]  I shouldn't even read the Chicago Tribune article about it.
[00:34:10.789 --> 00:34:12.610]  I mean, the white slavers even have lobbyists.
[00:34:14.059 --> 00:34:20.223]  I shouldn't talk about how the genetically engineered food, admittedly, is what's causing people who've never had allergies down to develop them.
[00:34:20.743 --> 00:34:24.145]  Because what happens is that they have chemicals in them.
[00:34:24.546 --> 00:34:38.014]  By the way, a big company that makes dozens and dozens, 30-something brands of dog food, one big factory, I'm going to dig the article out and cover it later, put genetically engineered corn in there that has a toxin that is killing dogs all over the country.
[00:34:39.058 --> 00:34:40.559]  With over 30 brands.
[00:34:40.999 --> 00:34:42.859]  And just quietly there's a recall going.
[00:34:43.139 --> 00:34:47.401]  Because they put GMO corn in there that kills mammals.
[00:34:47.481 --> 00:34:53.622]  I mean, this stuff is... By the way, those strains of corn already are showing up in every other major species of corn.
[00:34:53.642 --> 00:34:54.563]  See, it's spreading.
[00:34:54.603 --> 00:34:55.403]  It's taking over.
[00:34:56.244 --> 00:35:00.868]  Big article in the New York Times about it just a few days ago, but just nonchalantly, yeah, they don't oversee it.
[00:35:01.248 --> 00:35:04.430]  Yeah, they got pharmacological corn that grows chemicals in it.
[00:35:04.690 --> 00:35:10.414]  You can design corn to grow chemicals or live HIV virus or whatever you want in it.
[00:35:10.435 --> 00:35:14.437]  So they can then extract vaccine directly out of the corn.
[00:35:14.497 --> 00:35:15.298]  Isn't that wonderful?
[00:35:15.338 --> 00:35:20.082]  And that's spreading, and suddenly you'll have oak trees with corn stalks growing out of them.
[00:35:20.282 --> 00:35:21.302]  I mean, no, no, no, I'm serious.
[00:35:22.143 --> 00:35:23.144]  This is actually happening.
[00:35:24.737 --> 00:35:26.979]  And now people are getting all these weird allergies.
[00:35:27.019 --> 00:35:31.261]  You never had them because now the other allergens will help trigger it.
[00:35:31.281 --> 00:35:40.267]  They've got a lot of studies showing that if you already have certain chemicals in your blood at high levels, that will help trigger other allergies when you come into contact with natural pollens.
[00:35:42.725 --> 00:35:44.427]  Tree pollens, grass pollens, and the like.
[00:35:45.048 --> 00:35:47.791]  And so there's all these new illnesses and all these new sicknesses.
[00:35:47.831 --> 00:35:49.153]  It doesn't matter.
[00:35:49.834 --> 00:35:54.219]  It doesn't matter if autism's gone from 1 in 25,000 20-something years ago to 1 in 166.
[00:35:54.760 --> 00:36:01.168]  It doesn't matter if the CDC's own documents say they know it's brain-damaging the children in masks.
[00:36:01.708 --> 00:36:04.491]  They'll just tell us they've taken the mercury out and they've actually increased it.
[00:36:05.012 --> 00:36:06.153]  Had a medical doctor on last week.
[00:36:06.173 --> 00:36:06.874]  He goes, yeah, that's true.
[00:36:06.894 --> 00:36:09.297]  They're actually still in there and they've actually increased it.
[00:36:10.057 --> 00:36:10.858]  I have AP articles.
[00:36:10.878 --> 00:36:14.162]  But again, that's back of the paper, even if it ever makes it in the newspaper.
[00:36:14.642 --> 00:36:18.146]  Imagine being the AP writer that got all that together and put that out a year ago.
[00:36:18.266 --> 00:36:22.551]  Oh, contrary to popular belief, they've actually increased mercury instead of decreased it.
[00:36:23.778 --> 00:36:25.179]  I never saw it in a newspaper.
[00:36:25.259 --> 00:36:28.262]  Just one of the thousands of articles a week that just stays on the wire.
[00:36:28.282 --> 00:36:31.365]  Because an editor knew, well, that'll alarm the people.
[00:36:32.567 --> 00:36:38.573]  And that editor probably doesn't even care enough about his own grandkid that's six months old that's being brain damaged by shots.
[00:36:38.593 --> 00:36:39.634]  He won't even tell his daughter.
[00:36:39.654 --> 00:36:41.256]  So that'd be trouble, too.
[00:36:41.276 --> 00:36:43.358]  He'll just go play golf.
[00:36:45.034 --> 00:36:50.116]  When the kid's 18 months old, it'll go into the corner and go autistic from brain damage.
[00:36:50.156 --> 00:36:51.396]  It won't really matter.
[00:36:51.436 --> 00:36:52.477]  He'll just keep playing golf.
[00:36:52.517 --> 00:36:53.097]  He won't care.
[00:36:53.137 --> 00:36:56.138]  And then when he goes into a nursing home, he could add 10 more years of life.
[00:36:56.198 --> 00:37:00.379]  His kids will be just like him, and they'll put him in a cheap nursing home and let him die of bed sores.
[00:37:01.100 --> 00:37:02.440]  He won't care either.
[00:37:02.460 --> 00:37:05.101]  Because he wasn't going to live in a negative world.
[00:37:05.141 --> 00:37:06.881]  He wasn't going to deal with problems.
[00:37:06.921 --> 00:37:09.362]  He was just going to watch the horns.
[00:37:10.543 --> 00:37:11.083]  UT, baby.
[00:37:13.244 --> 00:37:15.466]  And you can tell I'm really in a bad mood right now.
[00:37:15.827 --> 00:37:17.388]  I am in a cross mood.
[00:37:17.408 --> 00:37:20.511]  In fact, I don't even want to interview this spook that's coming up.
[00:37:20.571 --> 00:37:22.673]  This CIA spook.
[00:37:24.634 --> 00:37:26.776]  I don't even want to even just argue with the person.
[00:37:26.796 --> 00:37:28.077]  I don't even want to entertain it.
[00:37:29.198 --> 00:37:30.259]  But we're going to have them on.
[00:37:30.279 --> 00:37:35.644]  I don't even want to... Frankly, I am really getting... I'm in a nasty mood right now.
[00:37:35.704 --> 00:37:36.505]  I'm going to be honest with you.
[00:37:36.525 --> 00:37:37.225]  I am mad.
[00:37:38.246 --> 00:37:39.968]  Because money isn't number one to me.
[00:37:41.155 --> 00:37:44.057]  But people being ripped off and scammed, that does get me mad.
[00:37:45.418 --> 00:37:46.799]  That really does make me mad.
[00:37:46.879 --> 00:38:08.856]  And to know that the bankers are openly bragging and openly saying, for as long as I've been researching them, that when their new order comes in, they're going to plunge our currency, they're going to totally drive the economy under, they're going to consolidate our wealth, they're going to take our pension funds, China's going to be the model, and they're going to team up with Europe, and we're going to be de-industrialized and then merged into the Pan American Union.
[00:38:09.796 --> 00:38:10.657]  It's all happening.
[00:38:11.137 --> 00:38:14.799]  And China eight months ago, along with Russia and others, began dumping the dollar.
[00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:17.921]  And what does the Treasury Secretary say?
[00:38:17.961 --> 00:38:19.062]  He says it's good.
[00:38:20.403 --> 00:38:31.610]  Now, we've had Chief Economist for Ronald Reagan on, Chief Economist for George Bush, the current George Bush on, saying that he's clearly behind terrorist attacks and clearly destroying the dollar, and it's horrible.
[00:38:32.691 --> 00:38:33.331]  What do they know?
[00:38:34.111 --> 00:38:36.393]  Snow's given us the proverbial snow job.
[00:38:38.476 --> 00:38:40.557]  Treasury Secretary, and says it's great.
[00:38:40.597 --> 00:38:41.637]  He says it's no big deal.
[00:38:41.657 --> 00:38:42.537]  He's in the paper today.
[00:38:43.537 --> 00:38:47.818]  He's in the New York Times today, January 6, 2006.
[00:38:51.179 --> 00:38:53.960]  He said yesterday on Thursday that it's no problem.
[00:38:54.480 --> 00:38:55.000]  No problem.
[00:38:55.820 --> 00:38:56.380]  It's okay.
[00:38:56.440 --> 00:38:56.720]  Fine.
[00:38:56.760 --> 00:38:56.940]  Great.
[00:38:56.960 --> 00:38:57.641]  It's no problem.
[00:38:59.821 --> 00:39:07.143]  That's the incredible thing about the economic indices, the numbers, is that I hear all these wannabe, know-it-all businessmen on the talk shows and
[00:39:07.831 --> 00:39:25.854]  I hear all these experts on MSNBC, and I hear them on the weekend financial shows, and they tell you how, oh, we're in a booming economy, and there's not high inflation, and a weak dollar's good, because that's what the big boys at the paid-off newspapers say.
[00:39:26.294 --> 00:39:29.315]  And so they think being smart means they just regurgitate it.
[00:39:30.775 --> 00:39:32.395]  And it's horrible financial advice.
[00:39:32.435 --> 00:39:36.836]  If you would have invested in gold three years ago, you would have more than doubled your money.
[00:39:37.877 --> 00:39:50.422]  The stock market isn't doing that, despite the fact that the Standard & Poor's, S&P, Dow Jones, NASDAQ, all the major indexes, they just take out of the basket any losing stocks, and they only put letters in.
[00:39:50.742 --> 00:39:54.343]  You look at the real stock market portfolio, it is in the toilet.
[00:39:54.843 --> 00:40:01.406]  But even if you look at the stock market itself in the last 10 years, it is underperforming.
[00:40:02.446 --> 00:40:06.848]  But they've got all these cooked graphs, and I mean, I know businessmen, I know people that
[00:40:09.597 --> 00:40:11.519]  Who just still, they just cannot get it.
[00:40:11.740 --> 00:40:12.941]  They just cannot get it.
[00:40:14.182 --> 00:40:19.408]  They cannot understand the fact that after you go off of the unemployment rolls, you are counted as employed.
[00:40:20.510 --> 00:40:22.652]  And so they'll run around saying unemployment's only at 4.1%.
[00:40:22.692 --> 00:40:23.133]  It is not at that.
[00:40:23.173 --> 00:40:23.573]  It is at around 15%.
[00:40:30.474 --> 00:40:46.041]  If you consider people that only have part-time jobs and are on welfare as being unemployed, that's what formerly in economics they would consider a part-time or day laborer as unemployed or only partially underemployed.
[00:40:46.061 --> 00:40:47.202]  There are different terms for it.
[00:40:47.702 --> 00:40:50.984]  But if you just look at people, period, out of jobs, period, it's around 9%.
[00:40:51.584 --> 00:40:52.464]  But who cares?
[00:40:52.684 --> 00:40:53.765]  Who wants real numbers?
[00:40:54.580 --> 00:40:55.000]  We're good to go.
[00:40:55.020 --> 00:40:55.181]  I think?
[00:41:17.742 --> 00:41:22.424]  I mean, I guess Dobbs is a little bit better than Cabuto, or Cabuto, or whatever his stupid name is.
[00:41:22.444 --> 00:41:33.587]  But the point is, and I'm trying to get at here is, the economy is growing at 3.3%, and those are even inflated numbers.
[00:41:34.347 --> 00:41:40.269]  They've been counting now for two years, all considered fast food.
[00:41:41.485 --> 00:41:46.489]  And that's around half of the restauranteurs in the country, millions and millions of people employed there.
[00:41:46.749 --> 00:41:56.816]  They are considering about half the restaurants in the country as manufacturing value-added consumable goods.
[00:41:58.557 --> 00:42:07.724]  They are... I know a consumable good really doesn't fall into the same... Well, there's two different definitions of consumable goods, but...
[00:42:08.701 --> 00:42:12.043]  It's a new, bizarre definition they have, and just take it from them.
[00:42:12.063 --> 00:42:21.790]  A cheeseburger is the same as a F1 pickup truck or a Chevy Silverado or a Dodge Ram.
[00:42:21.870 --> 00:42:25.572]  It just is, and that's the end of it.
[00:42:25.732 --> 00:42:28.114]  And don't argue with the government.
[00:42:28.414 --> 00:42:29.755]  That's just the way it is.
[00:42:31.316 --> 00:42:31.676]  Period.
[00:42:32.397 --> 00:42:34.178]  So there's no need to argue about it.
[00:42:35.771 --> 00:42:40.034]  Sometimes this is so ridiculous, I don't even want to go over how it's a fraud.
[00:42:40.074 --> 00:42:40.654]  I mean, why?
[00:42:40.714 --> 00:42:41.855]  What is even the point?
[00:42:41.895 --> 00:42:42.895]  It's so obvious.
[00:42:44.316 --> 00:42:49.499]  Let's say we have 12%, which they debate whether it's 10% or 15%.
[00:42:49.639 --> 00:42:53.902]  Different indexes show the real inflationary curve at between 10% and 15%.
[00:42:53.942 --> 00:42:54.582]  So I'll just say 12.5%, 13%.
[00:42:54.662 --> 00:42:55.343]  Pick a number.
[00:42:55.403 --> 00:42:55.823]  It doesn't matter.
[00:42:55.843 --> 00:42:56.783]  They say that it's a little over 3%.
[00:43:03.809 --> 00:43:04.950]  I think we're good to go.
[00:43:04.970 --> 00:43:05.650]  I think we're good to go.
[00:43:34.639 --> 00:43:38.463]  And they're right now literally training their Indian replacements.
[00:43:38.983 --> 00:43:39.404]  That's public.
[00:43:39.424 --> 00:43:41.085]  I'm sure you've all heard about that.
[00:43:41.666 --> 00:43:45.490]  And Bush has a plan to bring in even more skilled laborers to an unlimited level.
[00:43:45.770 --> 00:43:48.093]  Forget outsourcing, they'll just bring them right here.
[00:43:49.895 --> 00:43:54.740]  And so all of that is happening, and if you do the math, if inflation's 12%,
[00:43:56.696 --> 00:43:59.437]  But every year you're getting an increase in pay of 3.3%.
[00:43:59.937 --> 00:44:10.980]  Then if you do the numbers in 10 years, you're looking at losing tens of thousands of dollars of buying power.
[00:44:12.220 --> 00:44:17.121]  And if you look at it over a 25-year scale, it's just unbelievable.
[00:44:17.161 --> 00:44:18.562]  We are going into...
[00:44:20.715 --> 00:44:21.537]  We're good to go.
[00:44:36.127 --> 00:44:48.294]  Four and a half percent are kind of minion class, maybe living in a tiny house, but they've got maybe a fancy uniform so the slaves have to bow down to them in the streets.
[00:44:48.414 --> 00:44:50.876]  Cops, civil servants, stuff like that.
[00:44:51.236 --> 00:44:59.501]  And then you've got one half of one percent living in gigantic opulence, flying around in huge helicopters with slave pits full of sex slaves.
[00:45:00.186 --> 00:45:03.928]  Really, all over Asia, all over the Middle East, Israel, that's how they live.
[00:45:04.908 --> 00:45:08.270]  Actual slave pits with slaves and harems and everything.
[00:45:08.310 --> 00:45:09.430]  This is the world, folks.
[00:45:09.831 --> 00:45:11.371]  This is how the elite live.
[00:45:12.032 --> 00:45:14.033]  And you're going to get to enjoy that.
[00:45:15.220 --> 00:45:29.687]  Instead of having a middle class that is about 50% of the population, as it's always been, with a tiny elite of about 1%, and then 49% being blue collar but living pretty good and being happy, they're just changing the definitions.
[00:45:29.707 --> 00:45:31.707]  They're saying you're rich if you have an iPod.
[00:45:32.568 --> 00:45:39.651]  No longer are you rich if you've got your house paid for and can go on vacations and put your kids through college and aren't in debt.
[00:45:40.191 --> 00:45:41.472]  In the past, that was middle class.
[00:45:42.427 --> 00:45:49.411]  Now it's middle class if you've only got $100,000 in debt, and you've got an iPod and a Cadillac.
[00:45:49.831 --> 00:45:56.655]  You've got an iPod and a Cadillac and a big color TV, and your kids, oh, it's a big presentation.
[00:45:56.695 --> 00:45:58.876]  You give them the Nike tennis shoe made by slaves.
[00:45:59.417 --> 00:46:07.241]  They don't have any bank account, any savings account, no future, but you can strut around with maybe some jewelry hanging from you.
[00:46:09.346 --> 00:46:10.867]  So you're white trash rich.
[00:46:11.247 --> 00:46:14.070]  And they have other obnoxious names for it concerning black people.
[00:46:14.650 --> 00:46:18.553]  But the point is, is that this is a reality.
[00:46:19.373 --> 00:46:25.058]  And so you have nothing, you have no future, but they will tell you on the TV that if you have this bobble, you're rich.
[00:46:25.118 --> 00:46:26.739]  So people aren't even going to know.
[00:46:27.279 --> 00:46:35.005]  They're going to think, I've got a color TV and a car with some bling bling, and I've got a knockoff Rolex watch.
[00:46:36.349 --> 00:46:54.958]  And some of the trappings of wealth, and meanwhile the government officials are personally making, even at local levels, millions a year, and buying up everything and stealing private property, and the elites making trillions a year, and building huge prisons everywhere for your kids who they know don't have a future.
[00:46:54.978 --> 00:47:02.562]  You'll either join them in the global war to take over the planet in the name of fighting terror, or you're going to be a jail guard, or you're going to be in the prison.
[00:47:03.340 --> 00:47:05.821]  And listen, I heard a call yesterday to a talk radio show.
[00:47:05.841 --> 00:47:10.623]  I was aware of this, but to hear this sniveling idiot, he's going, I'm getting a master's degree at Texas A&M.
[00:47:10.703 --> 00:47:11.964]  And he goes, oh, a master's in what?
[00:47:12.764 --> 00:47:16.325]  Oh, in different economic modeling.
[00:47:16.365 --> 00:47:17.346]  He used some term.
[00:47:17.366 --> 00:47:18.966]  It'll pop my head in a second.
[00:47:20.127 --> 00:47:25.249]  And the individual, the talk show host said to him, he said, well,
[00:47:26.245 --> 00:47:27.425]  Well, what do you do?
[00:47:28.066 --> 00:47:30.806]  And he goes, well, it deals with Homeland Security.
[00:47:30.846 --> 00:47:45.130]  We tell businesses how to better organize their operations to get discounts, say, on insurance, because they will surveil their customers and track everything they do and run it through a government database.
[00:47:45.490 --> 00:47:48.410]  And the talk show host says, that's just wonderful.
[00:47:49.871 --> 00:47:51.931]  Because, see, they're training the new economy.
[00:47:51.971 --> 00:47:54.752]  It is prisons, and it's all run by the dying courts of the world.
[00:47:55.521 --> 00:47:56.904]  I mean, you want to go to college?
[00:47:56.944 --> 00:48:05.861]  Well, you can only get your college paid for through a government grant...
[00:48:07.611 --> 00:48:09.012]  You'll go for Homeland Security.
[00:48:09.552 --> 00:48:14.136]  So they're just going to have people that have these degrees, and they'll then be the federal and state funding for it.
[00:48:14.517 --> 00:48:15.718]  I've got a stack of the articles here.
[00:48:15.738 --> 00:48:20.101]  The graduates are coming out now, and every little town and city, they are becoming commissariat.
[00:48:20.622 --> 00:48:25.146]  And they literally will go around and command the police, and they will, quote, fight terror, and all crime is terror.
[00:48:25.446 --> 00:48:28.548]  And so they're literal spies that just go around running their lives.
[00:48:28.568 --> 00:48:30.270]  I mean, that's the new jobs.
[00:48:31.111 --> 00:48:32.191]  It's not computer programming.
[00:48:32.231 --> 00:48:33.152]  It's not building cars.
[00:48:33.232 --> 00:48:33.813]  It's literally...
[00:48:34.551 --> 00:48:39.613]  Going to be being a little Stasi secret police.
[00:48:40.733 --> 00:48:49.136]  And see, the insurance companies that are owned by the private Federal Reserve, predominantly, they set the policy, and then they hand up a little carrot.
[00:48:49.216 --> 00:48:59.060]  Oh, you get a 2% discount on your insurance if you adopt all of this and spy on your employees and everyone that comes in to rent a car or rent an apartment.
[00:48:59.320 --> 00:49:01.441]  He was saying on the air, it was just every industry.
[00:49:02.003 --> 00:49:03.644]  And that's true under Patriot Act compliance.
[00:49:04.264 --> 00:49:06.865]  And so that's the new America.
[00:49:06.945 --> 00:49:08.405]  That's what it's going to be.
[00:49:09.385 --> 00:49:12.226]  Unless we just really change it, because they have the money.
[00:49:12.506 --> 00:49:13.867]  They set the parameters.
[00:49:13.907 --> 00:49:15.507]  They set the infrastructure.
[00:49:15.527 --> 00:49:20.309]  And the infrastructure is going into the depths of depravity, the depths of corruption.
[00:49:21.929 --> 00:49:23.790]  And it is hellish.
[00:49:24.030 --> 00:49:27.471]  And there's all these good old boys who just love it.
[00:49:28.135 --> 00:49:43.863]  It's going to be people by good old boys who are just going to love every minute of it as they draw that blade across the neck of America and as those jugglers bust and just spew out, as those carotids spew and just spills that hot blood of America out on the ground.
[00:49:43.883 --> 00:49:46.905]  They're just, I love America, drawing that knife right across.
[00:49:46.925 --> 00:49:49.146]  Oh, yeah, I'm a good old boy.
[00:49:49.166 --> 00:49:52.908]  Just a good old boy, never meaning no harm.
[00:49:53.628 --> 00:49:56.910]  Been worshiping the government since the day they were born.
[00:49:58.795 --> 00:49:59.496]  I hope you love it.
[00:49:59.516 --> 00:50:00.576]  I hope you love it.
[00:50:00.596 --> 00:50:01.777]  And a lot of you will wake up.
[00:50:02.057 --> 00:50:03.758]  Oh, you'll wake up deep in the middle of it.
[00:50:04.399 --> 00:50:07.100]  You'll wake up one night and think, man, we were better off ten years ago.
[00:50:07.180 --> 00:50:08.221]  Man, before all this happened.
[00:50:08.521 --> 00:50:09.622]  How did this happen to us?
[00:50:09.722 --> 00:50:12.964]  I remember hearing that Alex Jones one day on the radio, and I laughed at him.
[00:50:13.785 --> 00:50:15.285]  How did it ever come down to this?
[00:50:16.266 --> 00:50:21.349]  How did it ever come down to it where somebody beneath you wants your job, so they're going to report you to Homeland, see?
[00:50:21.730 --> 00:50:23.050]  And you're going to be going, I'm innocent.
[00:50:23.651 --> 00:50:23.951]  I'm innocent.
[00:50:23.971 --> 00:50:25.932]  But see, that's going to be the fascistic economy.
[00:50:26.292 --> 00:50:27.013]  No, you're not.
[00:50:27.964 --> 00:50:29.805]  Maybe somebody above you wants your wife.
[00:50:30.365 --> 00:50:32.247]  Maybe somebody above you wants your ranch.
[00:50:33.127 --> 00:50:35.328]  See, because they're going to feed on everybody and get greedier and greedier.
[00:50:35.348 --> 00:50:38.110]  And it always happens.
[00:50:39.451 --> 00:50:39.811]  Well, what?
[00:50:39.851 --> 00:50:41.272]  I've been a Homeland Security officer.
[00:50:41.292 --> 00:50:43.773]  What are you doing taking my... Come with us, sir.
[00:50:43.793 --> 00:50:46.875]  We're going to take you to a camp and we're going to blow your head off.
[00:50:47.736 --> 00:50:48.396]  How's that sound?
[00:50:49.136 --> 00:50:49.697]  How's that sound?
[00:50:50.977 --> 00:50:53.299]  And they're going to take you and they're going to shoot you in the back of the head.
[00:50:53.319 --> 00:50:55.360]  They're going to melt you down for collagen.
[00:50:57.537 --> 00:50:58.838]  We're good to go.
[00:51:19.557 --> 00:51:21.539]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[00:51:21.739 --> 00:51:24.582]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[00:51:24.682 --> 00:51:29.346]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[00:51:29.546 --> 00:51:33.950]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[00:51:34.190 --> 00:51:41.417]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.

[00:53:38.387 --> 00:53:39.027]  Look I'll be honest with you.
[00:54:08.767 --> 00:54:11.248]  I just, sometimes I get really angry at what's happening.
[00:54:11.268 --> 00:54:14.549]  I can see it systematically setting up a police state.
[00:54:14.569 --> 00:54:16.770]  I mean, I've been to the FEMA camps.
[00:54:16.810 --> 00:54:21.632]  They're admittedly trying to put us in camps, break up our families, kill us, you name it.
[00:54:21.652 --> 00:54:22.832]  I mean, this is the globalist plan.
[00:54:22.852 --> 00:54:23.933]  They've written books about it.
[00:54:24.353 --> 00:54:25.193]  They're doing it.
[00:54:26.074 --> 00:54:37.178]  And I remember back in 2000, back in January of 2000, the Army War College released a report and said, we're going to sell implantable microchipping to the American people in the next decade.
[00:54:38.130 --> 00:54:38.651]  We're good to go.
[00:54:58.453 --> 00:55:01.115]  Who all the really cool trendies with the dreads and everything.
[00:55:01.135 --> 00:55:06.958]  Yeah, man, they all got the chip, the RFID, and it activates their computer, and everybody else who doesn't like it's just dumb and stupid.
[00:55:06.998 --> 00:55:08.959]  And, of course, they're all corporately funded.
[00:55:08.979 --> 00:55:17.184]  And they're just a bunch of intelligence ops out scamming, and they'll get massive TV attention, and the media will just push their books and their stuff.
[00:55:17.204 --> 00:55:18.745]  It's just these people are nuts, man.
[00:55:18.785 --> 00:55:23.528]  I mean, I'm watching systematically from Andy Rooney to the local teenagers to...
[00:55:24.526 --> 00:55:32.115]  Sean Hannity to the Mexican Attorney General to the former Health and Human Services Secretary going to middle schools around the country, elementaries.
[00:55:32.395 --> 00:55:35.018]  Tommy Thompson's now traveling the country going to schools.
[00:55:35.038 --> 00:55:37.701]  I've got to get a plane ticket and go videotape it at one.
[00:55:37.722 --> 00:55:39.684]  They didn't even let me in.
[00:55:40.024 --> 00:55:41.065]  You need to take the chip.
[00:55:41.085 --> 00:55:42.026]  The chip is good.
[00:55:42.087 --> 00:55:43.949]  I mean, this is not America!
[00:55:45.074 --> 00:55:57.200]  How am I supposed to sit around and talk about UT football all day, which doesn't matter a hill of beans, when actual body snatcher, crazy, weird, you know, Mars attack stuff's going on?
[00:55:57.240 --> 00:55:58.661]  I don't mean aliens are taking over.
[00:55:58.701 --> 00:55:59.561]  I mean that figuratively.
[00:55:59.601 --> 00:56:02.263]  It's of that same level.
[00:56:02.323 --> 00:56:07.745]  It's like hobgoblins are running around the street foaming at the mouth and no one's even paying attention to it.
[00:56:07.765 --> 00:56:10.887]  You know, it's the old elephant in the living room sitting on you.
[00:56:12.489 --> 00:56:15.631]  I mean, the universities predominantly are shifting over now.
[00:56:17.372 --> 00:56:19.933]  We'd like to get a scholarship to be an engineer.
[00:56:20.794 --> 00:56:22.555]  My son has got a 3.8.
[00:56:23.575 --> 00:56:25.797]  We're sorry, we're not offering as many of those now.
[00:56:26.077 --> 00:56:27.498]  How about Homeland Security?
[00:56:28.218 --> 00:56:29.499]  Well, okay, I guess so.
[00:56:29.559 --> 00:56:33.741]  And then, boom, you're recruited into it, into this whole domestic hell pit.
[00:56:34.622 --> 00:56:37.043]  It's so obvious what they're doing!
[00:56:38.599 --> 00:56:39.680]  I love this country!
[00:56:39.700 --> 00:56:41.601]  Do you realize how evil these people are?
[00:56:41.621 --> 00:56:43.203]  I know I keep repeating it.
[00:56:43.543 --> 00:56:54.011]  I can't get over Chicago Tribune reporting that the white slavers that kidnap women and children actually have lobbyists on the Hill!
[00:56:55.490 --> 00:56:56.551]  I mean, arrest them.
[00:56:56.611 --> 00:56:57.891]  What is wrong with people?
[00:56:58.432 --> 00:57:00.473]  Well, no, they got government backing.
[00:57:00.513 --> 00:57:02.154]  We're not allowed to arrest them.
[00:57:03.534 --> 00:57:07.076]  I'm a SWAT team commander, and I'm listening to you, Alex.
[00:57:07.116 --> 00:57:07.997]  I just don't believe it.
[00:57:08.277 --> 00:57:09.818]  Well, listen to me, buddy.
[00:57:10.078 --> 00:57:11.839]  You better go read it, then.
[00:57:12.960 --> 00:57:14.100]  You better go face it.
[00:57:14.801 --> 00:57:15.941]  Don't you deny it.
[00:57:15.981 --> 00:57:17.362]  Don't you try to get around it.
[00:57:17.442 --> 00:57:19.103]  Don't you turn that radio off.
[00:57:19.283 --> 00:57:20.844]  Don't you weevil around the truth.
[00:57:22.333 --> 00:57:27.316]  We've got criminals running the country who carry out terror attacks against us.
[00:57:28.717 --> 00:57:29.678]  It's declassified.
[00:57:29.718 --> 00:57:39.484]  I had the CIA commander from Afghanistan Ops on two days ago, and I talked about instances of our government carrying out terror bombings to blame it on people, and he said, yes, that's true.
[00:57:40.445 --> 00:57:45.228]  Now, I can show you the documents, I can show you the admissions of people that have given interviews.
[00:57:45.248 --> 00:57:47.209]  The point is, see, there they are admitting it.
[00:57:48.399 --> 00:57:50.240]  But we're not doing it today, Alex.
[00:57:50.720 --> 00:57:52.061]  You can trust us today.
[00:57:52.141 --> 00:57:56.223]  No, you're just making a big move, doing it 500 times what you ever did before.
[00:57:57.943 --> 00:58:01.645]  I mean, I know murdering criminals are in control, and they've got to be stopped.
[00:58:01.885 --> 00:58:05.887]  And I'm freaked out about it, because my wiring is in place, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:58:07.927 --> 00:58:09.688]  I mean, I don't know why I'm immune to it.
[00:58:09.728 --> 00:58:12.568]  I don't know why I respond like a normal person should respond.
[00:58:12.588 --> 00:58:19.270]  You know, Paul Revere didn't go suck his thumb and go, Oh, some Brits are landing with their guns to come get us.
[00:58:19.510 --> 00:58:23.091]  No, he got on his horse and rode down the road for 12 hours going, To arms!
[00:58:23.131 --> 00:58:23.631]  To arms!
[00:58:23.651 --> 00:58:24.872]  The Redcoats have landed!
[00:58:27.352 --> 00:58:28.393]  Get to the lanterns!
[00:58:28.473 --> 00:58:29.353]  Warn the troops!
[00:58:29.493 --> 00:58:30.013]  Rally!
[00:58:30.793 --> 00:58:32.554]  Rally the people to resist!
[00:58:34.754 --> 00:58:34.834]  Ah!
[00:58:35.454 --> 00:58:36.595]  Let them hear your war growl!
[00:58:36.955 --> 00:58:37.035]  Ah!
[00:58:41.064 --> 00:58:45.732]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[00:58:57.714 --> 00:58:58.354]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.015 --> 00:59:00.095]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.795 --> 00:59:01.896]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.556 --> 00:59:03.357]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.117 --> 00:59:05.018]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.038 --> 00:59:09.380]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.860 --> 00:59:13.982]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:14.723 --> 00:59:17.784]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:59:18.144 --> 00:59:19.825]  Got pretty fired up the last hour.
[00:59:21.066 --> 00:59:23.247]  The Pentagon openly said we're going to use fads.
[00:59:24.361 --> 00:59:27.162]  To tell the young people it's cool to take microchips, and they will.
[00:59:27.182 --> 00:59:28.663]  We'll also make our security people take them.
[00:59:28.683 --> 00:59:29.523]  That's another facet.
[00:59:30.964 --> 00:59:34.105]  And give people insurance discounts, connectivity, security.
[00:59:34.945 --> 00:59:36.506]  And now those exact things in the media.
[00:59:36.766 --> 00:59:38.366]  Ooh, the new trendy group of kids.
[00:59:38.426 --> 00:59:40.887]  The parents don't like it, but they're ultimately stylish.
[00:59:41.168 --> 00:59:42.968]  They take trucker chips.
[00:59:43.208 --> 00:59:44.729]  Nobody's going to tell them what to do.
[00:59:45.865 --> 00:59:47.626]  Yeah, nobody's going to tell me what to do.
[00:59:47.706 --> 00:59:49.007]  I make my parents mad.
[00:59:49.288 --> 00:59:54.732]  I go get a microchip, and the Pentagon literally is running the operation!
[01:00:00.796 --> 01:00:01.637]  I'm sick of it!
[01:00:03.678 --> 01:00:05.980]  Now that's how you're supposed to respond to this insanity!
[01:00:07.381 --> 01:00:08.101]  I'm screaming.
[01:00:08.121 --> 01:00:09.342]  I don't want to be a horse all weekend.
[01:00:09.362 --> 01:00:10.683]  I'm just so angry!
[01:00:11.804 --> 01:00:12.544]  Oh, I'm angry!
[01:00:14.173 --> 01:00:16.834]  Ugh, I'm just sick of it!
[01:00:17.594 --> 01:00:24.296]  Again, people go to football games and they act just like I'm acting over some stupid football game, and people consider that to be normal.
[01:00:24.336 --> 01:00:25.596]  Oh, look, he's a real fan.
[01:00:25.776 --> 01:00:31.017]  But I do it because the government openly is setting up a control grid to kill us.
[01:00:31.537 --> 01:00:36.259]  Government documents, we've done 100 shows, they're all posted, saying they want to reduce 85% or 95% of us.
[01:00:36.839 --> 01:00:40.100]  Just one-child policies, forced abortion, all of it.
[01:00:40.980 --> 01:00:41.660]  China's the model.
[01:00:42.658 --> 01:00:44.299]  And I'm not supposed to get upset about it.
[01:00:44.379 --> 01:00:44.819]  Oh, no.
[01:00:45.099 --> 01:00:49.320]  All the political consultants tell everybody, just be passive, be friendly, ask nice.
[01:00:49.360 --> 01:00:50.401]  That's how you get things done.
[01:00:50.701 --> 01:00:51.341]  Baloney.
[01:00:51.841 --> 01:00:53.222]  That's not how you get things done.
[01:00:53.262 --> 01:00:59.084]  You get things done by being obnoxious, by being aggressive, by being dynamic, by being in their face.
[01:00:59.144 --> 01:01:01.385]  We're not going to sit here and take it.
[01:01:02.945 --> 01:01:04.806]  These predators think we're going to lay down.
[01:01:05.066 --> 01:01:05.966]  They think we're going to take it.
[01:01:06.266 --> 01:01:08.287]  We are not going to take it.
[01:01:09.093 --> 01:01:10.416]  I'm not going to take it anymore.
[01:01:10.978 --> 01:01:11.679]  I'm angry.
[01:01:11.920 --> 01:01:12.782]  I'm alive.
[01:01:14.165 --> 01:01:15.127]  I'm an American.
[01:01:15.388 --> 01:01:16.230]  I'm red-blooded.
[01:01:16.551 --> 01:01:17.753]  Our history is better than that.
[01:01:17.833 --> 01:01:19.177]  Your history is better than that.
[01:01:20.453 --> 01:01:24.836]  We're one of the only countries in history to throw off the globals, to throw off the bankers, to throw off the European elite.
[01:01:25.016 --> 01:01:26.617]  And they've got us back in their clutches, man.
[01:01:26.637 --> 01:01:36.684]  They're doing some bad stuff to us with PR, written up by people, you know, with 190 IQs, with heads the size of, you know, a wheelbarrow.
[01:01:38.045 --> 01:01:39.846]  It's time to start getting angry.
[01:01:39.866 --> 01:01:43.409]  I'm going to say heads the size of a barrel.
[01:01:44.229 --> 01:01:47.652]  Blind China activists under house arrest since September...
[01:01:48.670 --> 01:01:53.472]  Our media always picks up on the story of, oh, that they put him in this house arrest, kind of always whitewashing it.
[01:01:53.492 --> 01:01:59.955]  I mean, I used to read stuff in their own press where they're like having sports stadium executions of political dissidents, but that's never in our news.
[01:01:59.975 --> 01:02:01.096]  It's just in the Chinese news.
[01:02:02.256 --> 01:02:05.498]  Oh yeah, they don't hide it, but our media knows how to give us the full extent.
[01:02:06.098 --> 01:02:09.780]  A blind activist in China and his family have been placed in her house arrest for four months.
[01:02:10.558 --> 01:02:12.398]  And then, of course, they don't get food and they starve.
[01:02:12.658 --> 01:02:20.020]  And he was beaten by thugs when he tried to venture out after exposing forced abortions in his home province on the East Coast.
[01:02:20.640 --> 01:02:37.323]  Club-wielding goons, believed to be hired by local authorities, have been posted outside Chin Luong Ching's one-story brick home in Dongshu, a farming village in Shandong Province, on September 6th to prevent him and his wife's 71-year-old mother from leaving.
[01:02:37.443 --> 01:02:39.203]  And then they're meant to starve to death in sight.
[01:02:40.350 --> 01:02:47.636]  I mean, just type in... For some reason, if you type in Chinese execution, for some reason, I was Google searching that.
[01:02:47.696 --> 01:02:50.558]  You can get the public execution photos if you want to go see it, folks.
[01:02:50.618 --> 01:02:53.680]  It's sports stadiums cheering like it was the UT football game.
[01:02:54.621 --> 01:02:56.062]  I'm sure it'll be like that here soon, too.
[01:02:56.262 --> 01:02:57.263]  They're warping us so bad.
[01:02:58.147 --> 01:03:00.668]  And it just shows dead babies on the street.
[01:03:01.248 --> 01:03:03.129]  Just little rotten dead babies.
[01:03:03.169 --> 01:03:04.649]  People just walking past them.
[01:03:04.729 --> 01:03:05.969]  I'm living in hell here.
[01:03:06.610 --> 01:03:07.630]  China is lawless.
[01:03:07.690 --> 01:03:11.971]  A 34-year-old activist told Reuters by telephone, they're worried I will expose more of their crimes.
[01:03:11.991 --> 01:03:14.272]  For some reason, I haven't killed him yet.
[01:03:14.472 --> 01:03:15.032]  Probably will.
[01:03:15.432 --> 01:03:17.193]  He'll be injected into some woman's lips.
[01:03:17.213 --> 01:03:21.634]  He'll be melted down into collagen before you can say, supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.
[01:03:22.791 --> 01:03:27.555]  Do President Hu Jinto and Premier Wen Jiabu know if they know?
[01:03:27.976 --> 01:03:29.197]  Why have they not done anything?
[01:03:29.277 --> 01:03:31.279]  Forced abortion is the national policy.
[01:03:31.339 --> 01:03:32.159]  My goodness.
[01:03:32.800 --> 01:03:37.224]  They get top dollar for those dead babies over here for medical experiments.
[01:03:37.244 --> 01:03:38.625]  That's mainstream news.
[01:03:38.645 --> 01:03:41.728]  I don't know what the State Department says.
[01:03:41.768 --> 01:03:43.249]  They're selling their body parts.
[01:03:43.770 --> 01:03:46.432]  Then the other State Department website says that it's an urban legend.
[01:03:46.973 --> 01:03:49.495]  We'll be right back with our next guest.
[01:03:54.110 --> 01:03:57.032]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[01:03:57.692 --> 01:03:58.993]  Alex Jones here, America.

[01:04:15.063 --> 01:04:18.847]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world, where the military and the police are merged.
[01:04:19.108 --> 01:04:23.753]  Witnesses' populations beg for national ID cards, and yes, even implantable microchips.
[01:04:23.833 --> 01:04:26.616]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies.
[01:04:26.916 --> 01:04:30.120]  Psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.
[01:04:30.160 --> 01:04:31.982]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.

[01:07:03.246 --> 01:07:10.088]  Michael Scheuer is our guest, and the book is Imperial Hubris.
[01:07:10.568 --> 01:07:14.890]  He is one of the, I guess, leading experts on Osama bin Laden.
[01:07:16.074 --> 01:07:17.235]  The press tells us.
[01:07:17.755 --> 01:07:19.695]  He's written the book Imperial Hubris.
[01:07:19.916 --> 01:07:24.137]  I just like that name because we do have Imperial Hubris in this country.
[01:07:25.118 --> 01:07:27.979]  And so Michael joins us now.
[01:07:28.079 --> 01:07:29.699]  Michael, tell us just in a nutshell.
[01:07:29.719 --> 01:07:30.680]  First off, thanks for joining us.
[01:07:31.660 --> 01:07:32.580]  Thank you for having me.
[01:07:32.760 --> 01:07:33.161]  You bet.
[01:07:33.541 --> 01:07:35.081]  Just a thumbnail sketch.
[01:07:35.121 --> 01:07:37.782]  Tell us about yourself and your background.
[01:07:38.543 --> 01:07:44.245]  Well, I'm originally from Buffalo, New York, and I was fortunate enough to be hired by the Central Intelligence Agency in 1982.
[01:07:46.124 --> 01:07:50.568]  I worked there for almost 23 years when I resigned about a year ago.
[01:07:50.728 --> 01:07:52.309]  Were you recruited out of college?
[01:07:52.649 --> 01:07:53.790]  No, sir.
[01:07:54.371 --> 01:08:00.436]  I had been out of college for a while, and in Buffalo at that time you couldn't find a job, so I was working as a crane operator for Union Carbide.
[01:08:00.456 --> 01:08:01.897]  Oh, that's how it works in these economies.
[01:08:01.917 --> 01:08:04.359]  You can't get a job, so you get one in the intelligence agency.
[01:08:06.160 --> 01:08:11.965]  Well, I was a crane operator for Union Carbide, and I just happened to apply for CIA, and it was the luckiest thing I ever did.
[01:08:12.620 --> 01:08:25.354]  Well, I mean, it's just funny because, I mean, you're obviously a very intelligent and interesting person with a lot of education, but I was talking last hour how with this new economy, that would pretty much be the only job we're going to be able to have now is Homeland Security.
[01:08:25.394 --> 01:08:29.439]  Have you seen how many colleges are acting like Homeland Security is going to be our new industry?
[01:08:29.719 --> 01:08:34.224]  Well, that's certainly the case, sir, and there's a big demand for that kind of technology.
[01:08:34.424 --> 01:08:37.266]  Business, and I'm not quite sure they know what kind of business they're in yet.
[01:08:37.886 --> 01:08:39.907]  Oh, I bet somebody up there does.
[01:08:40.708 --> 01:08:43.209]  Guys that draw those maps, boy, I think I've seen a few of them.
[01:08:43.249 --> 01:08:44.530]  It's pretty interesting looking.
[01:08:45.010 --> 01:08:46.291]  But, sir, I'll shut up.
[01:08:46.351 --> 01:08:50.733]  Again, so you're a crane operator out of college, but there's no real job for somebody with your skills.
[01:08:51.374 --> 01:08:52.814]  Did they approach you, or did you approach them?
[01:08:52.874 --> 01:08:53.715]  No, I approached them.
[01:08:53.975 --> 01:08:57.357]  They advertised in the American Historical Association bulletin.
[01:08:57.717 --> 01:09:04.419]  And I just was working on the third shift in Buffalo, and it was very cold, and I decided to apply for it, and I got the job.
[01:09:05.219 --> 01:09:06.059]  And I worked there until 2004.
[01:09:06.720 --> 01:09:16.342]  I spent the last 18 years of that period working in the Directorate of Operations, which conducts operations overseas.
[01:09:16.903 --> 01:09:25.105]  And for the last 10 years, I worked exclusively on Osama bin Laden, al-Qaeda, and generally Sunni terrorist groups around the world.
[01:09:26.227 --> 01:09:31.994]  And so you were, well, they're saying you were like a chief analyst, really one of the go-to guys.
[01:09:32.414 --> 01:09:39.242]  Like if I would say, Secretary of State, I want to know about Bin Laden and what he eats for breakfast, I'd go, and call you.
[01:09:39.502 --> 01:09:47.712]  Well, that was part of my job, but primarily, sir, I was responsible for running operations to try to capture or kill Bin Laden from...
[01:09:48.252 --> 01:09:49.773]  The Washington end of things.
[01:09:50.074 --> 01:09:56.539]  So were you liaisoning with anybody in particular there in Afghanistan?
[01:09:57.359 --> 01:10:01.663]  Well, we didn't have a presence in Afghanistan when I was there until after 9-11.
[01:10:01.683 --> 01:10:07.948]  We primarily worked through our officers and our facilities in Pakistan and other countries in the region.
[01:10:08.692 --> 01:10:09.953]  You know, that's an interesting question.
[01:10:10.173 --> 01:10:10.993]  I've seen different numbers.
[01:10:11.393 --> 01:10:14.494]  They say five times as much opium now, or seven times.
[01:10:14.955 --> 01:10:18.076]  Since the liberation, have you seen those numbers?
[01:10:18.116 --> 01:10:19.016]  Is it five or seven?
[01:10:19.036 --> 01:10:20.897]  Because the news keeps saying different things.
[01:10:20.917 --> 01:10:22.918]  Is it five times as much or seven times as much?
[01:10:23.138 --> 01:10:24.859]  I haven't seen the latter number, sir.
[01:10:24.899 --> 01:10:26.019]  I have seen the former.
[01:10:26.039 --> 01:10:28.240]  That's a huge increase.
[01:10:28.500 --> 01:10:33.202]  I'm not exactly sure how much it is, but that's their cash crop, certainly, at the moment.
[01:10:34.221 --> 01:10:36.083]  Yeah, and it's going into our kids' veins, isn't it?
[01:10:36.504 --> 01:10:43.312]  Well, ours, and especially into Europe and Russia and Great Britain.
[01:10:43.372 --> 01:10:43.592]  Wow.
[01:10:44.013 --> 01:10:49.179]  So, basically, you're this expert on bin Laden, but then you were also liaisoning with people trying to get bin Laden.
[01:10:50.380 --> 01:10:50.981]  Is that true?
[01:10:51.001 --> 01:10:53.004]  I read in the press about Bill Clinton.
[01:10:53.798 --> 01:11:01.005]  And where Sudan and Saudi Arabia and even Afghanistan offered to turn him over, but Bill Clinton never really responded?
[01:11:01.265 --> 01:11:06.029]  To the best of my knowledge, sir, that's absolutely incorrect.
[01:11:06.149 --> 01:11:08.251]  No one was willing to turn bin Laden over to us.
[01:11:08.311 --> 01:11:09.992]  He's a hero in the Islamic world.
[01:11:10.073 --> 01:11:11.133]  They're not going to give him to us.
[01:11:11.194 --> 01:11:12.735]  But we did give President Clinton...
[01:11:13.599 --> 01:11:19.245]  8 to 10 chances to either kill or capture Bin Laden, and they refused to do it on any of those occasions.
[01:11:19.645 --> 01:11:23.629]  So really, so even Sudan didn't hand over a bunch of files and offer to help get him?
[01:11:24.009 --> 01:11:25.931]  As far as I know, sir, that's an urban legend.
[01:11:26.632 --> 01:11:27.553]  An urban legend?
[01:11:27.653 --> 01:11:27.993]  Yes, sir.
[01:11:28.494 --> 01:11:30.275]  That's a good phrase to use.
[01:11:30.355 --> 01:11:30.676]  Okay.
[01:11:31.586 --> 01:11:38.551]  Is it an urban legend that Bin Laden's codename when he did some work for the CIA in the 80s and the Mujahideen was Tim Osmond?
[01:11:39.952 --> 01:11:40.112]  No.
[01:11:40.892 --> 01:11:48.437]  The one thing I'm very sure of, sir, is because when I started the operation to capture Bin Laden, we did a complete record search.
[01:11:48.677 --> 01:11:50.739]  We never were in contact with Bin Laden.
[01:11:51.819 --> 01:11:53.020]  He didn't want any part of us.
[01:11:53.040 --> 01:11:56.723]  Were you in connection to all the records of the Central Intelligence Agency?
[01:11:56.743 --> 01:11:57.203]  I was, sir.
[01:11:57.893 --> 01:11:59.573]  So you weren't compartmentalized at all.
[01:11:59.633 --> 01:12:01.254]  You had maximum clearance.
[01:12:01.534 --> 01:12:01.814]  Yes, sir.
[01:12:01.834 --> 01:12:04.135]  And you don't think anybody dispunged anything or anything?
[01:12:04.915 --> 01:12:05.395]  I'm sorry, sir?
[01:12:05.835 --> 01:12:20.619]  Well, I mean, I just read MSNBC, and we just had a CIA guy on the other day, and we were talking about how he was involved with the Mujahideen and the CIA and special forces were all over Afghanistan, and there's just no connection to bin Laden.
[01:12:21.431 --> 01:12:22.111]  No, sir.
[01:12:22.611 --> 01:12:28.153]  I think you're talking about Gary Bernstein, who has just written a very good book on another chance that we missed to capture bin Laden.
[01:12:28.253 --> 01:12:33.535]  Yeah, well, if he was the head CIA guy there with the ground team, I guess he was in contact with you in 2001, 2002?
[01:12:34.235 --> 01:12:35.435]  Yes, sir.
[01:12:36.255 --> 01:12:39.136]  So I'm confused by what you're saying and by what he was saying.
[01:12:40.056 --> 01:12:48.179]  Well, I'm not quite sure I understand what you mean, but we had no physical presence in Afghanistan because we didn't have an embassy there until after 9-11.
[01:12:49.540 --> 01:12:58.085]  We certainly were involved in Afghanistan, but the operations were run into that country from different countries, be it Pakistan or other countries in the region.
[01:12:58.185 --> 01:12:59.666]  Tajikistan, Uzbekistan?
[01:12:59.927 --> 01:13:02.588]  Yeah, the stands above in Central Asia, that's right.
[01:13:02.648 --> 01:13:05.970]  When Gary was there, he was there because he was the lead element of the U.S.
[01:13:06.010 --> 01:13:07.271]  invasion of Afghanistan.
[01:13:08.192 --> 01:13:11.834]  And he was there to chase and try ultimately to either capture or kill bin Laden.
[01:13:13.374 --> 01:13:16.117]  Now, your book, Imperial Hubris, I mean, who's imperial?
[01:13:16.418 --> 01:13:17.939]  Who's engaging in hubris?
[01:13:18.620 --> 01:13:31.234]  Well, I think our bipartisan leaders in both parties really are awfully full of themselves and are really leading us down the road to a disaster in terms of how we're handling the terrorist issue.
[01:13:33.737 --> 01:13:34.978]  Well, why over and over again?
[01:13:35.018 --> 01:13:41.023]  If he's cornered in Tora Bora, and he's cornered in this country and that country, or a predator's over him with the sights on him, why?
[01:13:41.103 --> 01:13:50.149]  Because I remember reading the press where the CIA would say, okay, and then, you know, well, wait for orders, and five hours later, he's not in the sights anymore.
[01:13:50.210 --> 01:13:51.130]  I mean, why did that happen?
[01:13:51.150 --> 01:13:52.091]  You said ten times.
[01:13:52.131 --> 01:13:53.252]  Why did that just keep happening?
[01:13:53.932 --> 01:14:05.138]  It happens because the political leaders in our country have begun to believe they are elected to be president of the world, sir, and rather than just to be president of America, and they don't choose to protect American citizens as their first priority.
[01:14:05.658 --> 01:14:11.061]  They're always more worried about what the Muslim world is going to think of us, and especially about what the Europeans are going to think of us.
[01:14:12.162 --> 01:14:22.627]  And so all the chances we've had to kill bin Laden or capture him have been frittered away on the basis of issues that are not directly related to the protection of the American people.
[01:14:23.931 --> 01:14:27.834]  Let's talk about protection of the American people, because I want to get specifically into your book and tell folks how they can get it.
[01:14:27.874 --> 01:14:28.614]  I'm sure it's great.
[01:14:28.654 --> 01:14:29.655]  I've been sending a copy.
[01:14:29.675 --> 01:14:30.695]  I haven't had time to read it yet.
[01:14:30.956 --> 01:14:31.536]  It's lengthy.
[01:14:32.256 --> 01:14:36.239]  But, I mean, I had Gary on two days ago, and you just mentioned one of your colleagues.
[01:14:37.173 --> 01:14:41.076]  Kind of leading the team there in Afghanistan, hunting bin Laden.
[01:14:41.116 --> 01:14:42.417]  He says a lot of the same things you're saying.
[01:14:43.198 --> 01:14:46.201]  I brought up Mosaddegh, and just, you know, where all this comes from.
[01:14:46.221 --> 01:14:55.468]  And I brought up how I'd actually heard Kermit Roosevelt in a recording decades old brag about how he carried out terrorist attacks, blew up mosques, shot people.
[01:14:55.508 --> 01:14:57.290]  He was real proud of it with the nine-man team.
[01:14:57.570 --> 01:14:58.411]  Hired a bunch of thugs.
[01:14:58.451 --> 01:15:01.873]  Handed out thousands of handbills saying, up with Mosaddegh, up with communism.
[01:15:02.334 --> 01:15:03.495]  Blaming it on Mosaddegh.
[01:15:04.015 --> 01:15:06.876]  And then we got the Shah, and then we got the Ayatollah Khomeini.
[01:15:06.916 --> 01:15:08.216]  I mean, I don't have to tell you the story.
[01:15:08.236 --> 01:15:09.817]  You've lived it, obviously.
[01:15:10.617 --> 01:15:13.538]  And so now we have this whole situation.
[01:15:13.558 --> 01:15:22.901]  Then I read an Israeli document from 1983, it's been in Haratz, where they said we want to break Iraq up into three or four pieces, and we want to actually radicalize them.
[01:15:22.941 --> 01:15:25.162]  We don't want good secular governments.
[01:15:25.222 --> 01:15:27.863]  We actually want them to be a bunch of frothing maniacs.
[01:15:28.323 --> 01:15:29.464]  I don't know about the second thing, sir.
[01:15:29.504 --> 01:15:33.525]  I think, you know, every generation, every administration has its own set of policies that it wants the CIA to pursue.
[01:15:33.545 --> 01:15:37.827]  And whether it was Mossadegh or the war in Afghanistan or the current war in Iraq...
[01:15:55.245 --> 01:15:58.106]  Those are pursued at the behest of the President, the CIA.
[01:15:58.607 --> 01:16:01.788]  I think people tend to forget that the CIA is a service organization.
[01:16:02.368 --> 01:16:03.789]  It's not a rogue organization.
[01:16:03.849 --> 01:16:05.810]  And isn't it one of the smallest agencies?
[01:16:06.150 --> 01:16:10.212]  It's a very small agency, sir, in terms of its actual operational capacity.
[01:16:10.232 --> 01:16:14.234]  Why do we always hear about CIA instead of, say, the NSA or Defense Intelligence?
[01:16:14.634 --> 01:16:23.378]  Generally because we have a mystique, which is very useful overseas, but also because it's an agency that can't defend itself because it's designed to be a quiet place
[01:16:24.193 --> 01:16:26.575]  Undemonstrative, unpublic agency.
[01:16:26.635 --> 01:16:33.160]  And so, when Senator McCain wants to beat somebody up in the government, the CIA is a good place to start because they won't fight back.
[01:16:33.680 --> 01:16:37.283]  Well, sir, I can give you 200 examples of declassified U.S.
[01:16:37.323 --> 01:16:46.950]  government admissions of our government carrying out attacks or paying others to carry out attacks, surrogates, to be blamed on right-wing, left-wing, communist enemies, Muslim enemies.
[01:16:47.350 --> 01:16:53.335]  And then now I hear about how there's this big war on terror, and I didn't hear you deny what happened with Mosaddegh because it's part of the public record.
[01:16:54.256 --> 01:17:04.646]  I mean, what's to say that some of these terror attacks we see today are somebody who's been paid by somebody who was paid by somebody who was paid by somebody at the World Bank so we can have a nice, big, fat police state?
[01:17:04.686 --> 01:17:05.667]  I want your take on that, please.
[01:17:06.488 --> 01:17:07.929]  Well, I suppose it's possible.
[01:17:07.969 --> 01:17:09.891]  I can only tell you I never saw anything like that.
[01:17:10.211 --> 01:17:17.398]  I can say that it's much more difficult to defend Americans than it is to, for example, when we were trying to kill Soviets in Afghanistan.
[01:17:17.438 --> 01:17:18.179]  That was very easy.
[01:17:18.976 --> 01:17:23.540]  But trying to protect Americans is a whole different story, but I've never seen anything that would resemble a U.S.
[01:17:23.580 --> 01:17:26.082]  sponsorship of an attack that endangered Americans.
[01:17:26.322 --> 01:17:30.245]  You've never seen, but you don't deny what Kermit Roosevelt wrote a book and gave interviews.
[01:17:30.265 --> 01:17:31.386]  He said he blew stuff up.
[01:17:31.546 --> 01:17:33.267]  I certainly cannot say that, sir, no.
[01:17:33.547 --> 01:17:34.008]  I don't have a...
[01:17:36.207 --> 01:17:40.070]  You know, a truthful intelligence officer will tell you he never knows everything.
[01:17:40.510 --> 01:17:42.032]  Oh, sure, that's very diplomatic.
[01:17:42.272 --> 01:17:45.815]  But hold on, you're saying you're an expert on all this and you don't know about 1953?
[01:17:47.516 --> 01:17:48.577]  Oh, no, I do know about it.
[01:17:48.597 --> 01:17:50.518]  I've read the history of it and I accept it as true.
[01:17:50.558 --> 01:17:53.501]  What I'm saying is that in my personal experience over the course of 22 years...
[01:17:54.321 --> 01:17:57.182]  I was never involved in anything that resulted in danger to America.
[01:17:57.222 --> 01:17:57.702]  I understand.
[01:17:57.762 --> 01:17:58.583]  I don't think you did, sir.
[01:17:58.623 --> 01:18:07.326]  What I'm saying is, how did we get to a point where the agency's only six years old, really older, it's really, you know, we all know what it is, skull and bones, OSS.
[01:18:08.567 --> 01:18:11.748]  How did they do that?
[01:18:11.808 --> 01:18:13.608]  Go kill people and blame it on somebody.
[01:18:14.389 --> 01:18:19.951]  I think it was just, if you read the history of the agency, there was not much congressional oversight, sir.
[01:18:20.620 --> 01:18:27.726]  And it was at a time where the elite of the East Coast universities, as you said, ran the agency and they thought they were above the government.
[01:18:28.506 --> 01:18:29.307]  Oh, I agree with that.
[01:18:29.347 --> 01:18:31.669]  Boy, that is veritas.
[01:18:31.929 --> 01:18:38.814]  I think that explains a great deal of the kind of swashbuckling behavior that we saw in the first decade of the agency's existence.
[01:18:39.094 --> 01:18:40.135]  Swashbuckling's right.
[01:18:40.295 --> 01:18:40.716]  Stay with us.
[01:18:40.756 --> 01:18:41.676]  This is riveting.
[01:18:41.836 --> 01:18:43.157]  I'll let you talk about what you want to talk about.
[01:18:43.238 --> 01:18:44.198]  I've grilled you enough.
[01:18:44.659 --> 01:18:47.381]  Imperial Hubris is the book and it's selling quite nicely.
[01:18:48.061 --> 01:18:48.722]  And, uh...
[01:18:49.443 --> 01:18:51.284]  You can get it for $17 at Amazon.com.
[01:18:55.768 --> 01:18:57.389]  Do you know the truth about breast cancer?
[01:18:58.009 --> 01:18:59.811]  Did you know that the race for the cure is over?
[01:19:00.911 --> 01:19:08.817]  The best kept secret in the country today is that it is now possible to kill cancer without personal suffering, mutilation, and poisoning of your entire system.
[01:19:09.037 --> 01:19:11.659]  Now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaysMed, Inc.'
[01:19:11.639 --> 01:19:13.060]  's patented methodology.

[01:20:23.316 --> 01:20:25.197]  That's because it has an elevated base.

[01:20:43.905 --> 01:20:45.865]  Currency, devaluation, inflation.
[01:20:46.005 --> 01:20:46.485]  One and the same.
[01:20:46.525 --> 01:20:48.606]  If you had deposited $100,000 in a bank at 1%,
[01:21:07.446 --> 01:21:12.908]  In a 30-month period dating from May 24, 2005, here is what happened to your funds.
[01:21:13.328 --> 01:21:16.449]  The dollar lost 33% of its value in that time frame.
[01:21:16.709 --> 01:21:18.550]  The bank paid you 1%.
[01:21:18.610 --> 01:21:21.631]  Your $100,000 now has a net purchasing power of $68,000.
[01:21:22.172 --> 01:21:24.392]  Here is reality.
[01:21:24.772 --> 01:21:28.354]  The devaluation of currency equals real inflation.
[01:21:28.834 --> 01:21:32.495]  Keep in mind how the value of your paper assets are measured in dollars.
[01:21:33.056 --> 01:21:35.897]  Gold, in the same time frame, increased 35% in value.
[01:21:37.222 --> 01:21:37.682]  We're good to go.

[01:22:37.803 --> 01:22:38.603]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:22:38.643 --> 01:22:39.724]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:23:05.476 --> 01:23:07.117]  Michael Scheuer is our guest.
[01:23:07.137 --> 01:23:08.959]  The book is Imperial Hubris.
[01:23:10.500 --> 01:23:13.842]  And we're, I guess, looking at both ends of it.
[01:23:13.902 --> 01:23:16.124]  The main guy who was in D.C.
[01:23:16.144 --> 01:23:23.969]  and also oversees some, trying to get Osama Bin Laden, and then we've also talked his counterpart who was leading the team, on the ground.
[01:23:24.910 --> 01:23:33.216]  And so the book, I guess, gets into the ten plus times that you guys tried to kill Bin Laden and just always magically the bureaucrats just
[01:23:34.023 --> 01:23:36.984]  Just for some reason wouldn't let you because they're just dumb.
[01:23:37.764 --> 01:23:39.625]  I mean, exactly what does the book cover, sir?
[01:23:40.365 --> 01:23:44.447]  Well, what I tried to address, and it's basically written for Americans, sir.
[01:23:45.307 --> 01:23:55.150]  I thought with both of my books that the information that they were being fed by the president, whether he's Republican or Democrat, has very little to do with reality.
[01:23:55.990 --> 01:23:57.531]  And I kind of wanted to show them that
[01:23:58.177 --> 01:24:04.999]  Two Americans that the terrorist threat we face can be understood simply by looking at the internet and by reading at the library.
[01:24:06.079 --> 01:24:14.502]  And my goal was to help Americans understand that we're being attacked because of what we do in the world and not because of who we are.
[01:24:15.782 --> 01:24:22.304]  We're not being attacked because we have gender equality or because we have elections or civil rights.
[01:24:23.665 --> 01:24:27.786]  It's because we are at least perceived in the Islamic world as being
[01:24:29.999 --> 01:24:30.760]  Anti-Islamic.
[01:24:30.900 --> 01:24:32.580]  They're not attacking Canada.
[01:24:32.760 --> 01:24:34.060]  They're not attacking Japan.
[01:24:34.640 --> 01:24:35.081]  That's right.
[01:24:35.181 --> 01:24:39.142]  And, you know, Bin Laden himself has said in a speech, you Americans don't get it.
[01:24:39.282 --> 01:24:41.082]  If we hated freedom, we'd attack Sweden.
[01:24:41.882 --> 01:24:48.084]  We're attacking you because you're over here, because you're supporting, for example, the dictatorships in Saudi Arabia and Egypt.
[01:24:48.564 --> 01:24:49.744]  That's why we're attacking you.
[01:24:50.484 --> 01:24:53.425]  And that was really the goal of my book, was to say that...
[01:24:55.275 --> 01:25:09.606]  We're in a great deal of danger if we don't begin to realize that the ephemeral things that President Bush or President Clinton talk about as being the motivation of our enemy really have nothing to do with the danger we're in.
[01:25:11.767 --> 01:25:16.371]  So, I mean, I would imagine you have suggestions for solutions in the book?
[01:25:16.791 --> 01:25:18.933]  Well, I certainly think we haven't killed enough of the enemy, sir.
[01:25:19.921 --> 01:25:29.224]  I think, first of all, over the course of my career, certainly the American people do not get the application of the military power that they pay for.
[01:25:29.244 --> 01:25:35.547]  What about P2OG, which is a Pentagon program, but Rumsfeld actually wants to stir them up?
[01:25:35.587 --> 01:25:39.768]  I mean, if you go around killing people, isn't that just going to generate more resistance?
[01:25:40.048 --> 01:25:48.011]  Well, certainly in some manner it will do that, sir, but I think one thing we underestimate is because our presidents and our leaders continue to say that
[01:25:49.095 --> 01:25:53.498]  Bin Laden and what he represents is the lunatic fringe of the Muslim world.
[01:25:54.118 --> 01:26:00.301]  We somehow think that there's a limited amount of animosity toward us and only a small number of people who are going to attack us.
[01:26:01.122 --> 01:26:03.043]  And the reality is much different than that.
[01:26:03.669 --> 01:26:11.814]  The reality is that by 90 or 95 percent at some times in Muslim countries, they hate our foreign policies and our actions.
[01:26:11.995 --> 01:26:17.338]  Well, Iran doesn't have 120 countries occupied by troops.
[01:26:17.498 --> 01:26:19.480]  When we say our government, I mean, come on.
[01:26:19.920 --> 01:26:24.203]  They admit in the big policy reports that the big central banks pass around.
[01:26:24.223 --> 01:26:30.527]  It's not a secret that big global financial interests just own this country and just use it as their political pawn.
[01:26:30.547 --> 01:26:33.009]  Now, I certainly am not saying Saudi Arabia is great.
[01:26:34.270 --> 01:26:36.712]  You know, harems full of children kidnapped out of Europe.
[01:26:36.732 --> 01:26:37.253]  That's public.
[01:26:37.273 --> 01:26:38.574]  I mean, they're absolute scumbags.
[01:26:38.814 --> 01:26:40.296]  But see, our government loves them.
[01:26:40.316 --> 01:26:50.526]  I mean, I think that's one reason that a lot of Muslims don't like us is they do see us supporting the Saudi leadership, which, I mean, honestly, can you think of anyone more scummy and degenerate and sickening?
[01:26:51.327 --> 01:26:51.848]  No, I can't.
[01:26:52.128 --> 01:26:57.053]  I think they are the epitome of vileness, if you will.
[01:26:57.725 --> 01:27:03.970]  And I think you only can blame our government for not having done anything regarding energy policy since the embargo in 1973.
[01:27:05.171 --> 01:27:10.955]  But then we get Saddam, who let... 60% of the women graduating... I mean, the graduates are women.
[01:27:11.315 --> 01:27:12.476]  Christians are left alone.
[01:27:12.496 --> 01:27:14.257]  There's rock and roll music on.
[01:27:14.277 --> 01:27:17.860]  And so let's go have him be our buddy and have him get in a fight with Iran.
[01:27:18.280 --> 01:27:20.342]  And then let's tell him, yeah, go ahead and invade Kuwait.
[01:27:20.362 --> 01:27:23.604]  And then he does, and we call him Camel Boy on TV.
[01:27:23.884 --> 01:27:25.946]  And then we go grab him, and then we do... I mean, this is...
[01:27:26.846 --> 01:27:28.327]  So, I mean, what is the policy then?
[01:27:29.488 --> 01:27:39.935]  I'm not exactly sure what our foreign policy is, and I think that's one of the main problems, is that we don't have a foreign policy that at all is in mesh with the way the world works at the moment.
[01:27:41.576 --> 01:27:46.999]  And to me, so much of it comes down to oil and our support for the Israelis.
[01:27:47.975 --> 01:27:55.317]  If those two things are not going to change at all, then we're going to continue to be in the position we have been over the past decade, and that's going to be more dead Americans.
[01:27:55.537 --> 01:27:58.397]  I've got to read this book, because this isn't what I really expected from this interview.
[01:27:58.417 --> 01:28:05.699]  A lot of what you're saying really does make sense, because I read about the Saudis, what they admit they do, and I find it even hard to believe.
[01:28:05.739 --> 01:28:08.039]  I know why their population hates them so much.
[01:28:08.100 --> 01:28:10.840]  That's exactly right, sir.
[01:28:10.860 --> 01:28:11.440]  Probably the most...
[01:28:15.609 --> 01:28:24.355]  The motivational aspect of our policy is our support for those dictatorships, whether it's in Saudi Arabia or Kuwait or Jordan or Egypt or Algeria.
[01:28:24.635 --> 01:28:25.515]  Can you stay with us?
[01:28:25.555 --> 01:28:29.498]  Because I want to hear your insight on this and your analysis on this, sir.
[01:28:29.738 --> 01:28:30.118]  Yes, sir.
[01:28:30.458 --> 01:28:31.439]  If you'd like, I can do that.
[01:28:31.799 --> 01:28:32.540]  Okay, great.
[01:28:32.560 --> 01:28:38.023]  We'll be right back with our guest, talk more about the book, because, I mean, he's really getting down to brass tacks.
[01:28:38.584 --> 01:28:38.984]  Stay with us.
[01:28:43.826 --> 01:28:44.767]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.227 --> 01:28:46.848]  The empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.769 --> 01:28:50.550]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:56.875 --> 01:29:02.118]  Do you desire your health and vitality to be in harmony with the rhythms of nature?
[01:29:04.929 --> 01:29:13.294]  TriVortex technology features subtle energy products that boost energy levels, release pain and stress, and much more at very affordable prices.
[01:29:13.954 --> 01:29:21.398]  You have the opportunity to wear vitamins, minerals, and nutrients that absorb through your skin rather than taking them orally.
[01:29:21.899 --> 01:29:23.680]  This is real, not science fiction.
[01:29:24.360 --> 01:29:33.005]  Go to TriVortex.com, that is T-R-I-V-O-R-T-E-X.com to open a whole new realm of health and vitality for you and your family.
[01:29:35.683 --> 01:29:45.330]  This is Brian David Anderson, inventor of TriVortex technology products that assist in so many areas, such as pain relief, symptoms of menopause, losing weight, or stopping smoking.
[01:29:45.831 --> 01:29:49.734]  TriVortex technology is in harmony with the rhythms of nature.
[01:29:53.494 --> 01:29:57.077]  Do you know where the 78 potentially active volcanoes in the U.S.
[01:29:57.097 --> 01:29:57.597]  are located?
[01:29:57.817 --> 01:30:01.200]  And do you know the locations of the top 300 prime terrorist targets?
[01:30:01.420 --> 01:30:06.143]  You can find these answers and more in the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA.
[01:30:06.423 --> 01:30:11.407]  With the more than 50 interactive parameters, you can pinpoint natural and man-made disaster areas.

[01:30:12.147 --> 01:30:12.668]  We're good to go.
[01:30:32.640 --> 01:30:37.282]  The ideal location for cabins and vacation homes as well as safe and unsafe areas.

[01:30:52.847 --> 01:30:53.929]  You don't love me anymore.
[01:30:54.289 --> 01:30:56.072]  You used to take such good care of me.
[01:30:56.092 --> 01:30:57.554]  Is that my car talking to me?
[01:30:57.735 --> 01:30:58.015]  Yes.
[01:30:58.316 --> 01:30:59.157]  You neglect me.
[01:30:59.317 --> 01:31:01.300]  Change my oil late most of the time.
[01:31:03.143 --> 01:31:04.145]  Use the cheapest gas.
[01:31:04.485 --> 01:31:05.347]  I'm getting sick.
[01:31:05.687 --> 01:31:07.851]  One of these days, I'm just gonna give up.
[01:31:08.911 --> 01:31:09.372]  Wait a minute.
[01:31:09.472 --> 01:31:11.072]  I've got three more years of payments on you.
[01:31:11.092 --> 01:31:19.897]  If you want me to last forever, you need to add protected engine treatment, protected transmission treatment, and especially protected complete fuel system treatment.
[01:31:20.357 --> 01:31:25.820]  Protected unique synthetic fortifiers treat the metal and the oil to reduce friction like no other.
[01:31:26.060 --> 01:31:28.441]  Okay, I'll add some protecta, but you'll have to perform.
[01:31:28.581 --> 01:31:33.246]  How about faster acceleration, more horsepower, longer lasting.
[01:31:33.466 --> 01:31:35.128]  I'll always be there for you.
[01:31:35.308 --> 01:31:38.651]  So if you want more, treat it right with Protecta by SFR.

[01:31:54.924 --> 01:32:03.832]  Michael Sawyer is our guest.
[01:32:03.872 --> 01:32:05.213]  The book Imperial Hubris.
[01:32:05.293 --> 01:32:05.854]  I need to read it.
[01:32:07.575 --> 01:32:10.418]  Because I thought this interview would just be the regular CI interview.
[01:32:10.898 --> 01:32:11.939]  We've made some mistakes.
[01:32:13.780 --> 01:32:16.623]  The Arabs, they want to kill America.
[01:32:16.663 --> 01:32:17.644]  They hate freedom.
[01:32:19.020 --> 01:32:25.667]  I mean, I can debate with my guests why they wouldn't let him ten times kill Bin Laden or kill these individuals.
[01:32:27.109 --> 01:32:29.731]  I mean, clearly they want that threat to still be out there.
[01:32:29.951 --> 01:32:34.796]  Then you can debate about the nature of that threat and who's pulling the marionette's strings.
[01:32:35.317 --> 01:32:39.922]  I mean, it's like the... I was driving down the road and heard an old Megadeth song.
[01:32:40.876 --> 01:32:42.377]  It sounded like this radio show.
[01:32:42.398 --> 01:32:51.870]  The lyrics, just like the Pied Piper turned rats loose, just like the marionette swings to the symphony of destruction.
[01:32:52.555 --> 01:32:54.416]  And the whole thing is about creating threats.
[01:32:54.496 --> 01:32:55.657]  I mean, children's movies.
[01:32:56.258 --> 01:32:58.960]  Star Wars Episode III, Revenge of the Sith.
[01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:02.923]  The Emperor's really attacking the Empire himself to expand his powers.
[01:33:03.463 --> 01:33:05.244]  And it's the same MO over and over again.
[01:33:05.845 --> 01:33:07.446]  And that's what P2OG states.
[01:33:07.466 --> 01:33:08.927]  It's what the Israeli documents state.
[01:33:08.947 --> 01:33:09.887]  It's what PNAC states.
[01:33:09.927 --> 01:33:11.849]  It's what Virginia Brzezinski states.
[01:33:11.909 --> 01:33:13.450]  It's what Operation Northwood states.
[01:33:13.710 --> 01:33:16.012]  We've all covered that here in great detail.
[01:33:16.072 --> 01:33:20.195]  But regardless, there really are some Muslim groups that really do want to go around killing people.
[01:33:20.735 --> 01:33:22.877]  And then they lie to us about the motivation.
[01:33:23.157 --> 01:33:26.099]  And I guess that's what our guest book gets into.
[01:33:26.660 --> 01:33:28.501]  Obviously an expert on the Middle East and Central Asia.
[01:33:29.742 --> 01:33:30.702]  Please continue, sir.
[01:33:30.722 --> 01:33:32.624]  We were talking about Saudi Arabia.
[01:33:33.214 --> 01:33:35.655]  Well, sure, three or four personalities, at least in a whole
[01:34:02.691 --> 01:34:05.833]  A whole host of political figures, they don't have much courage at all.
[01:34:05.914 --> 01:34:07.775]  I think that's part of it, sir.
[01:34:07.815 --> 01:34:25.648]  You know, it's always struck me that sooner or later it's going to occur to the American people that Muslims who are trying to get rid of the Saudi government, for example, or the Mubarak government, it is sort of ridiculous to call those people freedom haters.
[01:34:27.130 --> 01:34:31.513]  They're trying, I think, to get rid of governments that are by any definition tyrannies.
[01:34:32.239 --> 01:34:38.584]  And as you noted, there's 6,000 Saudi princes on the payroll of Saudi Arabia.
[01:34:38.664 --> 01:34:40.826]  None of the money goes to the people of Saudi Arabia.
[01:34:40.846 --> 01:34:42.127]  It goes to the royal family.
[01:34:43.108 --> 01:34:51.274]  And so I think once we begin to understand that, we'll begin to understand why America is hated by so many Muslims.
[01:34:52.095 --> 01:34:59.521]  And until we do that, we're just going to be listening to Mr. Bush or Mr. Clinton or Senator Kerry or Senator McCain as they kind of whine about
[01:35:01.127 --> 01:35:02.888]  The attack on our liberties.
[01:35:02.989 --> 01:35:07.751]  The only attack on our liberties goes on via the government.
[01:35:09.532 --> 01:35:10.052]  Our government.
[01:35:12.874 --> 01:35:20.258]  So in a perfect world, what would you do to try to at least lessen the problems in the Middle East?
[01:35:20.558 --> 01:35:22.239]  There's no quick fix, as you said, sir.
[01:35:22.279 --> 01:35:23.660]  It's going to be a long process.
[01:35:23.700 --> 01:35:26.802]  But what we have is a choice between war and endless war.
[01:35:27.614 --> 01:35:38.782]  The one thing we have to do is to begin to find a way to wean ourselves and our allies from their dependence on oil in the Persian Gulf.
[01:35:39.383 --> 01:35:44.346]  If it wasn't for oil, the whole Arabian Peninsula wouldn't be worth the life of one U.S.
[01:35:44.386 --> 01:35:44.747]  Marine.
[01:35:45.748 --> 01:35:54.294]  The next thing we need to do, and we can only do it after that begins, is to begin to stop supporting police states in the Islamic world.
[01:35:54.855 --> 01:36:03.701]  People don't realize that a man like Osama Bin Laden spent the first 15 years of his adult life as a peaceful reformer inside of Saudi Arabia.
[01:36:04.741 --> 01:36:13.687]  And for 15 years they struggled to get the king to stop some of the corruption and stop some of the un-Islamic behavior they were doing.
[01:36:14.587 --> 01:36:16.148]  So those are a couple of things.
[01:36:16.208 --> 01:36:17.409]  We need to look at Israel.
[01:36:17.849 --> 01:36:18.650]  Sir, you've studied this.
[01:36:18.690 --> 01:36:22.052]  Why don't you tell us, without getting too graphic, some of the things these princes do?
[01:36:23.283 --> 01:36:49.382]  Well, certainly, I think there's a common knowledge that they are good Muslims at home, but overseas they are well-known for debauchery of all sorts, whether it's in the flesh markets of Bangkok in Southeast Asia or in the gambling casinos of Europe and Monte Carlo and the other places, they are
[01:36:50.197 --> 01:36:56.307]  Certainly among the most debauched, if you will, people in the world.
[01:36:57.028 --> 01:36:58.450]  And I think that's the PG version.
[01:37:01.907 --> 01:37:04.590]  There's probably an X version, which is more despicable.
[01:37:04.690 --> 01:37:05.290]  Yeah, certainly.
[01:37:05.310 --> 01:37:09.814]  I've seen the mainstream reports about the huge jets landing in Saudi Arabia.
[01:37:10.275 --> 01:37:14.338]  I mean, it's just amazing to see this going on.
[01:37:14.398 --> 01:37:22.966]  Why does our government, Republican and Democrat, why do they love scum like that so much, but then demonize upright countries over there?
[01:37:24.745 --> 01:37:32.268]  It seems to me it has to be the oil and the power of the oil industry and the durability of the oil industry over the past half century.
[01:37:32.809 --> 01:37:41.893]  I cannot think of another reason why apparently a good Christian man like George Bush would hold hands with the president of Saudi Arabia.
[01:37:42.213 --> 01:37:44.154]  What does Israel want out of all of this?
[01:37:44.295 --> 01:37:46.816]  I mean, they've got a lot of different interests, but what's their main drive?
[01:37:48.335 --> 01:37:51.797]  You know, I'm kind of at a loss to know what the Israelis want anymore.
[01:37:52.618 --> 01:37:59.541]  But I do think it's time that we began to be the great power and they began to be the minor power in the relationship between ourselves.
[01:38:01.903 --> 01:38:04.224]  So you're saying they've gotten too big for their britches?
[01:38:04.644 --> 01:38:05.865]  Certainly in my view they have, sir.
[01:38:06.972 --> 01:38:09.853]  They've gotten to the point in this country where they can control the debate.
[01:38:10.113 --> 01:38:15.615]  You know, very few American politicians can say a negative word about Israel without being called publicly an anti-Semite.
[01:38:15.715 --> 01:38:17.796]  What are there, six and a half million people in Israel?
[01:38:18.256 --> 01:38:19.357]  I think that's about right, sir.
[01:38:19.377 --> 01:38:21.237]  I'm not exactly sure.
[01:38:21.277 --> 01:38:23.298]  So that's a small state in the United States.
[01:38:23.988 --> 01:38:29.193]  It's barely a blot on the map compared to the United States, sir.
[01:38:29.253 --> 01:38:32.116]  Texas is 20, 24 million, California 30-something million.
[01:38:32.556 --> 01:38:33.397]  What is a country?
[01:38:33.477 --> 01:38:38.122]  Six million people, and then half of them don't agree with the policy at any one time.
[01:38:39.162 --> 01:38:41.124]  How do you think Sharon's going to tie into all this?
[01:38:41.144 --> 01:38:43.527]  Sharon dying today.
[01:38:43.587 --> 01:38:44.728]  I wasn't aware that he had died.
[01:38:44.768 --> 01:38:45.809]  I knew that he was very ill.
[01:38:46.561 --> 01:38:49.065]  Yeah, I said that he died a few hours ago.
[01:38:49.085 --> 01:38:54.874]  I tend to think, sir, that the conflict between the Israelis and the Palestinians is probably irreconcilable.
[01:38:55.783 --> 01:38:56.904]  They're going to have to live with that.
[01:38:56.924 --> 01:39:00.707]  So really isn't it just a total state of war where the government gets to tell the press they can't report?
[01:39:00.747 --> 01:39:09.675]  And really isn't more of it about the Palestinian government getting to dominate their population and the Israeli government getting to dominate their population and getting military aid?
[01:39:09.735 --> 01:39:14.399]  And it's just kind of like a Groundhog Day movie where it's just the same thing forever?
[01:39:14.679 --> 01:39:16.480]  Well, it's been Groundhog Day for 40 years.
[01:39:16.580 --> 01:39:17.842]  I think that should stop.
[01:39:18.102 --> 01:39:21.865]  I don't think it really matters to Americans in their everyday life or their national security
[01:39:22.478 --> 01:39:25.921]  Whether the Israelis beat the Palestinians or the Palestinians beat the Israelis.
[01:39:26.462 --> 01:39:32.687]  Well, obviously nobody's going to beat Israel when they've got 400 weapons on cruise missiles, submarines, and artillery.
[01:39:32.847 --> 01:39:40.293]  Well, that's certainly the beginning of wisdom for American politicians to begin to say you need to stop thinking of Israel as the underdog since they're a nuclear power.
[01:39:40.614 --> 01:39:42.495]  Well, I mean, what are they, the fourth biggest power?
[01:39:42.796 --> 01:39:43.136]  Yes, sir.
[01:39:43.857 --> 01:39:44.037]  So...
[01:39:44.887 --> 01:39:50.071]  I mean, it's not like they've got German submarines, cruise missiles.
[01:39:51.352 --> 01:39:54.734]  The reports are long-range missiles.
[01:39:54.754 --> 01:39:59.317]  Yeah, I don't know what kind of weaponry they have, but it's certainly enough to beat any combination of the Arabs.
[01:40:00.618 --> 01:40:05.822]  Well, did you hear about that Knesset member about two years ago that said that if... He didn't say it jokingly.
[01:40:05.862 --> 01:40:10.064]  He said, you know, we could have nuclear blackmail on Europe to pay us reparations.
[01:40:11.145 --> 01:40:12.166]  Well, I wouldn't doubt it, sir.
[01:40:12.876 --> 01:40:17.259]  And there's certainly a cold-bloodedness about the Israelis that I wouldn't put anything past them.
[01:40:18.440 --> 01:40:22.302]  You know, it seems like the intelligence agency people wouldn't talk like you're talking a few years ago.
[01:40:22.322 --> 01:40:23.963]  Ray McGovern's done it, many others have.
[01:40:25.324 --> 01:40:30.968]  Are people angry in Washington, the intelligence agencies, that Israel's been blackmailing the administrations?
[01:40:31.668 --> 01:40:36.171]  Oh, I think whether you call it blackmail or just a very...
[01:40:38.073 --> 01:40:49.548]  Is it safe to say, though, I mean, with the neocons, most of them dual citizenship, I mean, it seems like we really have been supplanted for the first time in U.S.
[01:40:49.588 --> 01:40:50.589]  history and actually have.
[01:40:50.970 --> 01:40:54.635]  I go as far as saying a semi-foreign government is now in control of the United States.
[01:40:55.556 --> 01:40:56.996]  You know, I don't know the extent to that, sir.
[01:40:57.036 --> 01:41:04.998]  I was never in high enough circles, but I certainly resent the fact at the most basic level that in the United States you cannot debate the issue of Israel.
[01:41:05.358 --> 01:41:10.280]  You know, there should be nothing too dangerous to debate in the United States, but certainly that's one issue.
[01:41:10.300 --> 01:41:13.820]  Well, that's like Colin Powell saying it's not anti-Semitic if I criticize Israel.
[01:41:14.120 --> 01:41:16.441]  Well, it certainly is not.
[01:41:16.761 --> 01:41:20.622]  70% of American Jews in a major Gallup poll that just came out are against the war.
[01:41:21.565 --> 01:41:21.805]  Yeah.
[01:41:22.105 --> 01:41:24.207]  So I guess they're anti-Semitic now.
[01:41:25.767 --> 01:41:31.831]  Well, that's the problem, sir, is the major media immediately pick up on any criticism of Israel.
[01:41:31.871 --> 01:41:34.072]  Hey, I get criticized because I'm not anti-Israel.
[01:41:35.173 --> 01:41:36.813]  I'm just against what their policies are.
[01:41:37.894 --> 01:41:38.734]  You know, I don't care.
[01:41:38.755 --> 01:41:42.276]  From my own personal view, sir, I don't care what their policies are.
[01:41:42.396 --> 01:41:43.497]  I don't care what they do.
[01:41:43.517 --> 01:41:48.540]  It's simply that I don't think America should take any pain or any heat for what they do.
[01:41:49.799 --> 01:41:52.701]  Well, it also alienates Turkey and people, doesn't it?
[01:41:52.741 --> 01:41:54.561]  Well, I don't know if it alienates Turkey.
[01:41:54.581 --> 01:41:56.983]  The Turks are pretty close to the Israelis.
[01:41:57.523 --> 01:42:01.345]  But it alienates certainly the massive percentage of the Muslim population.
[01:42:01.365 --> 01:42:02.225]  Has there been a shift?
[01:42:02.305 --> 01:42:07.448]  I mean, at least publicly, the Turks are having to pay lip service now and kind of getting angry at what we're doing?
[01:42:07.488 --> 01:42:09.129]  Oh, in Iraq, you mean?
[01:42:09.429 --> 01:42:09.669]  Yes.
[01:42:09.869 --> 01:42:14.131]  Yeah, well, they're certainly upset about what we're doing in Iraq because of the Kurdish section in the north.
[01:42:14.231 --> 01:42:15.071]  It's pressuring them.
[01:42:15.332 --> 01:42:15.992]  Absolutely, sir.
[01:42:16.955 --> 01:42:17.455]  Absolutely.
[01:42:18.216 --> 01:42:23.498]  There's a hundred unforeseen consequences to the Iraq invasion that are going to come home to ruin.
[01:42:23.518 --> 01:42:30.600]  Well, it's like somebody who's on 50 medications, and then they just keep putting us on more and more, and nobody even knows what the adverse reactions are going to be.
[01:42:30.740 --> 01:42:31.721]  Well, that's exactly right.
[01:42:31.781 --> 01:42:35.722]  Although, to be fair, the adverse reactions of Iraq were pretty predictable.
[01:42:36.203 --> 01:42:37.383]  No one wanted to listen to them.
[01:42:37.403 --> 01:42:42.445]  And when you ask about the feeling within the intelligence community, I think it's less anger than frustration.
[01:42:43.228 --> 01:42:50.034]  That so much of the information that we have reported over the past decade has not been used by the government or has been ignored.
[01:42:50.835 --> 01:42:52.817]  It's no surprise what's happening in Iraq.
[01:42:53.197 --> 01:42:56.620]  The government knew that before it went in.
[01:42:56.660 --> 01:42:57.781]  That's what I was saying earlier.
[01:42:57.841 --> 01:43:02.385]  I read this 83 Israeli plan, and I can send it to you if you haven't heard of it.
[01:43:03.266 --> 01:43:05.048]  This top general wrote it up.
[01:43:05.068 --> 01:43:06.469]  They said we need to have the U.S.
[01:43:06.509 --> 01:43:09.692]  go in, break it up into three or four regions, have a weak central government,
[01:43:10.052 --> 01:43:22.017]  And just secure the pipelines and have some military bases to control Iran and Syria to hold the middle of the Middle East, you know, that bulwark or that fulcrum, whatever you want to call Iraq, right in the middle there.
[01:43:22.617 --> 01:43:26.579]  And then I predicted a year before we invaded, and now it's on NPR every day.
[01:43:26.919 --> 01:43:28.180]  We've got a new plan.
[01:43:28.500 --> 01:43:30.301]  Just break it up in four parts.
[01:43:30.381 --> 01:43:35.423]  And then they tell us, I mean, you know, we hear we're failing in Iraq, but really that was the policy.
[01:43:36.460 --> 01:43:40.603]  Well, you know, I hate to think that that's true, but it's certainly the reality.
[01:43:40.643 --> 01:43:43.805]  If not the plan, they certainly stumbled into it.
[01:43:45.085 --> 01:43:49.428]  You know, I heard the CIA officer who a lot of Syriana was... Have you seen Syriana yet?
[01:43:49.468 --> 01:43:50.729]  I have, yes, sir.
[01:43:51.049 --> 01:43:52.110]  What was the real agent's name?
[01:43:52.210 --> 01:43:52.570]  Bear?
[01:43:52.730 --> 01:43:53.130]  Bear.
[01:43:53.551 --> 01:43:55.992]  Yeah, and then they slightly change it in the movie.
[01:43:56.412 --> 01:44:00.175]  But from all my research, didn't they just take three different real stories and kind of mix them together?
[01:44:01.328 --> 01:44:04.649]  As far as I can tell, sir, there was a great deal of accuracy in that movie.
[01:44:05.109 --> 01:44:09.270]  I don't really know what percentage is true and what percentage is fiction.
[01:44:09.310 --> 01:44:12.651]  I heard Bear on NPR saying it's basically all true, but I didn't know that was true.
[01:44:12.711 --> 01:44:15.312]  I mean, I knew a lot of it matched stuff I'd read about and seen.
[01:44:15.792 --> 01:44:16.432]  Yeah.
[01:44:16.452 --> 01:44:18.112]  Well, Bear would know.
[01:44:18.232 --> 01:44:21.433]  It was based on his book and his life, so I guess he would know pretty much.
[01:44:21.693 --> 01:44:28.255]  And then when he wouldn't go, he'd done everything for him, and even tortured him, he kept his mouth, and then they tried to burn him.
[01:44:28.275 --> 01:44:28.355]  Yeah.
[01:44:29.801 --> 01:44:31.930]  The messenger is usually the one that gets killed, sir.
[01:44:33.174 --> 01:44:34.961]  In terms of career and future...
[01:44:35.546 --> 01:44:40.490]  The guy who brings the bad news or who does the dirty work is usually the person who gets bumped.
[01:44:40.991 --> 01:44:45.234]  But I mean, how has it changed from the time when presidents were actively really involved and weren't?
[01:44:45.254 --> 01:44:49.337]  I mean, it seems like things are getting much more arrogant and decadent.
[01:44:49.558 --> 01:44:51.119]  You used the proper word, hubris.
[01:44:52.060 --> 01:44:56.123]  I mean, it just seems like we're like Rome, just in there fiddling while everything's burning.
[01:44:56.463 --> 01:44:57.864]  Well, I think that's exactly right, sir.
[01:44:57.904 --> 01:45:03.329]  I think the whole problem, for example, Osama bin Laden could have been killed in the cradle had Clinton...
[01:45:03.951 --> 01:45:04.374]  Acted in 1998 or 1999.
[01:45:07.222 --> 01:45:13.506]  And they didn't, and so now we have this, which is rapidly becoming a worldwide problem for the United States.
[01:45:13.587 --> 01:45:22.673]  Oh, but P2OG says that's exactly what the Pentagon wants, and their little special office of plans in there is to widen it.
[01:45:22.733 --> 01:45:24.954]  I mean, talk P2OG into a search engine.
[01:45:25.235 --> 01:45:34.601]  I'm not saying you're not informed, because there's a million things I don't know, stuff so big, you have to study your whole life to be an expert on one issue, but P2OG... I will look at it.
[01:45:35.101 --> 01:45:38.903]  And they say that actually the plan is to make the Arabs hate us and attack us.
[01:45:39.203 --> 01:45:46.365]  Then they get to widen the war, then the defense contractors make more money, then there's more terror attacks here, and then we get to be a police state.
[01:45:47.186 --> 01:45:55.209]  I mean, all this NSA stuff which has been going on, all of the... I mean, sir, I've been to urban warfare training drills before 9-11 where U.S.
[01:45:55.229 --> 01:46:00.230]  Marines trained with role players with Americans screaming, I'm an American, please don't put me in a camp.
[01:46:00.591 --> 01:46:04.032]  So, I mean, were you aware of how far those programs have gone?
[01:46:04.592 --> 01:46:06.953]  No, sir, I'm not cognizant of that at all.
[01:46:07.033 --> 01:46:17.459]  What would you do if you saw video that I shot, hours of it, of Hebron, Maryland, Oakland, California, South Texas, where the Marines are training to take over our cities and put us in camps?
[01:46:19.194 --> 01:46:22.116]  Well, I would, you know, again, I've not seen anything like that.
[01:46:22.136 --> 01:46:24.498]  Did you ever hear of 29 Palms, you know, the survey?
[01:46:24.518 --> 01:46:24.658]  Sure.
[01:46:24.738 --> 01:46:25.058]  Okay.
[01:46:26.159 --> 01:46:33.984]  Well, we could play an ABC News clip of them in the suburbs in million-dollar houses, not helping people but confiscating their guns in New Orleans, first chance they got.
[01:46:34.344 --> 01:46:39.828]  I'm telling you, sir, it is a program to train our military to oppress us.
[01:46:39.888 --> 01:46:43.210]  That is an ongoing strategic training initiative.
[01:46:44.654 --> 01:46:50.616]  Well, you know, the only thing I can reflect is that the founders wanted us to be able to be armed for exactly that reason.
[01:46:51.536 --> 01:46:54.797]  So I think protecting the Second Amendment becomes even more important.
[01:46:54.937 --> 01:46:58.438]  So you're not going to go along with... I mean, look, a nuke goes off.
[01:46:58.698 --> 01:47:00.498]  Nobody knows why the government does nothing.
[01:47:00.678 --> 01:47:01.379]  People panic.
[01:47:01.419 --> 01:47:02.539]  Stock market crashes.
[01:47:02.819 --> 01:47:06.180]  And then suddenly they don't give cities in the surrounding area proper aid.
[01:47:06.400 --> 01:47:08.641]  They just stand off and let things deteriorate.
[01:47:08.961 --> 01:47:13.722]  Then they get to bring in mass force, set the precedent for total control, and we're in a dictatorship.
[01:47:14.986 --> 01:47:23.211]  Well, certainly, I don't know if there's plans or not, but a nuclear device that went off in this country would certainly involve the military in governing us to an extent never before seen.
[01:47:23.612 --> 01:47:25.313]  I think there's no way to avoid that.
[01:47:25.573 --> 01:47:28.295]  Whether they plan for that or not, I'll have to take your word on that.
[01:47:28.655 --> 01:47:33.158]  Yeah, the plan is to leverage that into the end of America.
[01:47:33.478 --> 01:47:37.661]  Well, certainly, that's what bin Laden is aiming at, in the sense that he believes that
[01:47:38.280 --> 01:47:43.005]  There would be no way for America to deal with a nuclear attack except with the military.
[01:47:43.025 --> 01:47:53.976]  Why would he want to give these corporate interests that want to totally capture us, why would he give them what they wanted and then America will be turned into a fascist worldwide empire machine that dwarfs what it is now?
[01:47:53.996 --> 01:47:57.360]  I wonder why bin Laden would do what will help the internationalists.
[01:47:58.383 --> 01:48:01.046]  Well, first of all, I don't think he believes that it would.
[01:48:01.426 --> 01:48:03.268]  And second, he's a pretty parochial guy.
[01:48:03.308 --> 01:48:07.572]  He's got fish to fry at home, and what he wants is an hour rear ends out of his area, sir.
[01:48:08.152 --> 01:48:11.696]  Oh, but his family gets rewarded despite him with getting all our big contracts.
[01:48:11.716 --> 01:48:17.261]  Oh, his family is... Another one of the reasons we haven't killed him is because his family is so important to the king.
[01:48:17.737 --> 01:48:20.018]  And we don't want to offend the king of Saudi Arabia.
[01:48:20.238 --> 01:48:23.219]  I saw Bandar Bush or one of them on TV.
[01:48:23.299 --> 01:48:24.200]  I've got it on tape somewhere.
[01:48:24.220 --> 01:48:25.540]  It was like four years ago.
[01:48:25.560 --> 01:48:27.821]  They were like, don't talk too bad about bin Laden.
[01:48:27.861 --> 01:48:29.822]  It was like Larry King was saying bad things about him.
[01:48:30.242 --> 01:48:34.884]  And then they had this Saudi diplomat on going, yeah, it was Bandar, going, well, he's not that bad.
[01:48:34.904 --> 01:48:37.946]  And we're not even allowed to say he's bad.
[01:48:38.006 --> 01:48:38.586]  Come on.
[01:48:39.126 --> 01:48:39.787]  Go all the way.
[01:48:39.847 --> 01:48:41.047]  We know what's going on here.
[01:48:41.847 --> 01:48:42.788]  Come on.
[01:48:42.928 --> 01:48:43.608]  Come on.
[01:48:44.168 --> 01:48:45.169]  This is disgusting.
[01:48:45.959 --> 01:48:47.500]  Just go all the way.
[01:48:47.520 --> 01:48:48.401]  You know what's going on.
[01:48:50.682 --> 01:48:52.003]  I don't know what's going on, sir.
[01:48:52.264 --> 01:48:55.766]  I can tell you what I know, but I can't get into things that I don't know.
[01:48:55.966 --> 01:48:56.307]  Do this.
[01:48:56.347 --> 01:48:57.407]  Do five more minutes with me.
[01:48:57.427 --> 01:48:59.028]  We'll plug your book, too, because I want to be fair.
[01:48:59.048 --> 01:49:01.830]  I want to talk to Jeff, Jeff, Joe, and Nathaniel.
[01:49:02.251 --> 01:49:05.033]  And guys, you're going to have to ask your questions in like 30 seconds.
[01:49:05.593 --> 01:49:09.436]  So he can get his answer out after this quick two and a half minute break we're about to have.
[01:49:09.896 --> 01:49:10.937]  And then we'll come right back to you.
[01:49:10.957 --> 01:49:11.617]  Can you do that with us?
[01:49:11.817 --> 01:49:12.237]  Aye, aye, sir.
[01:49:12.698 --> 01:49:13.318]  Aye, aye, sir.
[01:49:13.378 --> 01:49:13.758]  All right.
[01:49:14.179 --> 01:49:15.159]  Beam me up, Scotty.
[01:49:16.300 --> 01:49:17.321]  We'll be right back.
[01:49:17.761 --> 01:49:19.062]  Folks, we're not playing checkers here.
[01:49:19.102 --> 01:49:19.922]  We're playing chess.
[01:49:19.962 --> 01:49:28.808]  It's a complex situation, but I think if you really look at it and you look at the past indicators, you can really get a picture of what's going on.
[01:49:29.469 --> 01:49:30.569]  Folks, it isn't pretty.
[01:49:30.629 --> 01:49:34.692]  And see, I don't have the time, the energy, the funds to send everybody, like our guest...
[01:49:36.331 --> 01:49:37.573]  All my films, my material.
[01:49:38.033 --> 01:49:39.515]  But see, that's where we come in.
[01:49:39.535 --> 01:49:40.597]  We've been on the ground.
[01:49:40.657 --> 01:49:42.459]  We know what's happening.
[01:49:42.479 --> 01:49:43.961]  We have the other part of the equation.
[01:49:44.722 --> 01:49:45.443]  And it isn't pretty.
[01:49:45.463 --> 01:49:46.164]  We'll be right back.
[01:49:46.184 --> 01:49:46.604]  Stay with us.
[01:49:54.818 --> 01:49:57.660]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[01:49:57.921 --> 01:49:58.621]  Hello, my friends.
[01:49:58.721 --> 01:49:59.502]  Alex Jones here.
[01:49:59.842 --> 01:50:04.526]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[01:50:04.866 --> 01:50:11.592]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[01:50:11.912 --> 01:50:13.894]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[01:50:14.094 --> 01:50:16.937]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[01:50:17.037 --> 01:50:21.701]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.

[01:52:49.333 --> 01:53:01.139]  All right, it's Michael Shoyer, book and trail hubris.
[01:53:01.179 --> 01:53:01.919]  I'm going to read it.
[01:53:03.060 --> 01:53:08.042]  I was earlier in the show going, ah, we've got another one of these CIA propagandas coming on and
[01:53:09.193 --> 01:53:10.634]  So much of what he's saying is true.
[01:53:12.054 --> 01:53:14.595]  Just from what I've confirmed, that it's scary.
[01:53:14.615 --> 01:53:18.836]  This is one of the more scary interviews, kind of like Ray McGovern, when he's on with us routinely.
[01:53:19.836 --> 01:53:22.237]  Chief Briefer for Ronald Reagan and Bush Sr.
[01:53:23.517 --> 01:53:25.278]  Let's just race through some calls.
[01:53:25.718 --> 01:53:27.419]  Jeff and Mash, you're on the air with our guest.
[01:53:27.439 --> 01:53:27.819]  Go ahead.
[01:53:28.499 --> 01:53:29.059]  Yes.
[01:53:29.359 --> 01:53:29.839]  Very simple.
[01:53:29.859 --> 01:53:38.142]  As far as the war and terror is concerned, why don't we just simply cut off all foreign aid to all these communist and
[01:53:38.607 --> 01:53:47.074]  Radical Muslim countries and close and shut off all these trade treaties with Mexico, South America, and Canada.
[01:53:47.414 --> 01:53:52.478]  Well, if they really cared about radical Muslims killing people, we'd be invading Sudan right now.
[01:53:53.198 --> 01:53:54.359]  I mean, it's just baloney.
[01:53:54.399 --> 01:53:58.502]  If there's resources or it's got something strategic, it's invasion time.
[01:53:58.562 --> 01:54:00.644]  Let me get a comment by our guest on that.
[01:54:01.365 --> 01:54:04.367]  Yeah, I think we've got ourselves wrapped around the axle on this one.
[01:54:04.387 --> 01:54:05.828]  We can't really cut off the...
[01:54:09.128 --> 01:54:13.031]  As long as we're tied to Israel and as long as we're dependent on Middle East oil.
[01:54:13.391 --> 01:54:14.412]  That's the bottom line.
[01:54:14.872 --> 01:54:17.834]  And until those two things change, more and more Americans will be killed.
[01:54:19.055 --> 01:54:25.260]  Well, I mean, not to mention just the excuse of terrorism to turn America into a police state.
[01:54:25.320 --> 01:54:26.020]  I'll finish up, Jeff.
[01:54:26.401 --> 01:54:29.883]  Yeah, because you see, nations don't have friends, they have interests.
[01:54:30.664 --> 01:54:35.127]  And you see, we funded international communism in both China and Russia...
[01:54:36.269 --> 01:54:40.052]  By the way, thanks for the call, Jeff.
[01:54:40.132 --> 01:54:40.753]  Actually, that's true.
[01:54:40.793 --> 01:54:48.698]  I saw the former CIA section chief on the History Channel five years ago say what I knew, that our government actually put Mao in.
[01:54:48.738 --> 01:54:55.003]  Let's go ahead and talk to, unbelievable, a guy who killed 60 million people, Jeff in Denver.
[01:54:55.043 --> 01:54:55.603]  Another Jeff.
[01:54:55.623 --> 01:54:55.824]  Go ahead.
[01:54:55.844 --> 01:54:56.604]  You're on the air with our guest.
[01:54:56.864 --> 01:54:57.825]  Yeah, I'll make this real quick.
[01:54:57.865 --> 01:54:58.986]  I've got a two-part question.
[01:54:59.907 --> 01:55:09.477]  John P. O'Neill was Deputy Director of the FBI, and of course he was, according to several reports, was Bin Laden's major pursuer in the U.S.
[01:55:09.517 --> 01:55:12.380]  government, and of course he was in charge of all the...
[01:55:13.089 --> 01:55:22.337]  Worldwide terrorist investigations, the World Trade Center 93, the... And it just so happened, his first day at work, knew how to security, handed over from Marvin Bush, went to work, and bye-bye.
[01:55:22.637 --> 01:55:23.398]  Yep, exactly.
[01:55:23.418 --> 01:55:37.629]  And the USS Cole, he was in charge of all the major terrorist investigations, and he resigned as Deputy Director because he said the Bush administration had blocked intelligence agency investigations on... Quote, they were going to let an attack happen to get Afghan oil.
[01:55:37.869 --> 01:55:42.093]  Not only that, Alex, he said that, you know, O'Neill actually went public with these charges, and
[01:55:42.532 --> 01:55:45.714]  And of course he became, like you said, head of security at the World Trade Center.
[01:55:45.734 --> 01:55:48.575]  We were actually setting him up for the show when 9-11 happened, okay?
[01:55:48.595 --> 01:55:54.159]  Yeah, and then he further stated that the main obstacle to investigate Islamic terrorism was U.S.
[01:55:54.619 --> 01:55:57.621]  oil corporate interest and the role that Saudi Arabia... I hear you.
[01:55:57.641 --> 01:55:58.901]  Let me get a comment from our guest.
[01:55:59.181 --> 01:55:59.482]  Go ahead.
[01:56:00.942 --> 01:56:10.668]  I hate to disagree with your caller and yourself, but from my personal experience, John O'Neill was the single most important impediment to the capture of Osama bin Laden.
[01:56:11.509 --> 01:56:12.309]  Before his death.
[01:56:12.489 --> 01:56:14.750]  Yeah, I think I heard you on another talk show saying that.
[01:56:14.930 --> 01:56:19.010]  Yeah, the FBI is going to make a... It's got a great public relations department.
[01:56:19.050 --> 01:56:21.311]  It's making him into a saint and into a hero.
[01:56:21.351 --> 01:56:22.571]  There's going to be a movie about him.
[01:56:22.971 --> 01:56:30.533]  But he was a singularly unscrupulous man who did more to block attacks on Osama bin Laden than probably anybody but Richard Clarke.
[01:56:32.273 --> 01:56:35.974]  Boy, apropos that he died on 9-11.
[01:56:36.014 --> 01:56:38.054]  There's something almost biblical about it, sir.
[01:56:38.891 --> 01:56:41.913]  That certainly was the reaction among the people who had worked with him.
[01:56:42.174 --> 01:56:44.515]  If there was any justice on 9-11, that may have been it.
[01:56:45.056 --> 01:56:49.859]  Why would, in your claim, why would he block different investigations?
[01:56:49.919 --> 01:56:58.366]  He and most FBI people are less interested in the safety of the United States and most interested in protecting the reputation of the FBI.
[01:56:58.626 --> 01:57:06.412]  Well, I'd like to have you back on sometime to prove all of that, or proof it, because the FBI and the CIA, aren't you guys always attacking each other?
[01:57:07.652 --> 01:57:10.013]  I have no use for the FBI, if that's the question, sir.
[01:57:10.033 --> 01:57:13.154]  But they're just a singularly incompetent organization.
[01:57:13.414 --> 01:57:14.314]  They have no computers.
[01:57:14.354 --> 01:57:15.254]  They have no leadership.
[01:57:15.294 --> 01:57:16.915]  But they have wonderful public relations.
[01:57:17.795 --> 01:57:23.637]  And to ensconce a person like John O'Neill as a hero, when he was responsible as much as anyone... Well, you know what?
[01:57:23.757 --> 01:57:24.817]  We've got a 60-second break.
[01:57:24.917 --> 01:57:29.978]  There's five more minutes, because I want to hear you give us specifics on this.
[01:57:30.158 --> 01:57:30.479]  Stay there.
[01:57:30.499 --> 01:57:31.659]  We'll be back in 60 seconds.
[01:57:33.368 --> 01:57:38.252]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-300-7645.
[01:57:56.301 --> 01:57:57.162]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.182 --> 01:58:01.505]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.025 --> 01:58:06.148]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:07.569 --> 01:58:12.953]  We're talking to Michael Scheuer, the book Imperial Hubris.
[01:58:12.973 --> 01:58:19.877]  I meant to have him on for 30 minutes, now we're going into the second hour here, but we've got the Libertarian Party of New Hampshire coming on.
[01:58:20.118 --> 01:58:23.160]  They're having to file bills to stop federal gun confiscation.
[01:58:23.180 --> 01:58:23.480]  I mean, it's
[01:58:24.355 --> 01:58:25.376]  To make it felonies.
[01:58:25.456 --> 01:58:26.736]  I mean, it's literally happening.
[01:58:26.917 --> 01:58:29.658]  So that's coming up in just a few minutes.
[01:58:29.778 --> 01:58:31.559]  But we're here talking to Michael.
[01:58:31.619 --> 01:58:33.740]  I'll try to cram in one or two more calls here in just a second.
[01:58:33.760 --> 01:58:35.682]  We've only got about four minutes now with him.
[01:58:36.482 --> 01:58:45.087]  And he was one of the top CIA officers liaisoning with the actual troops on the ground in Afghanistan trying to get Osama bin Laden.
[01:58:47.277 --> 01:58:50.419]  But so much of what he said has been accurate according to my research.
[01:58:50.439 --> 01:58:51.700]  You're talking about John O'Neill.
[01:58:51.720 --> 01:58:59.325]  Why would John O'Neill tell the London Independent and French TV that they're going to let the World Trade Center get attacked, even said that specifically.
[01:58:59.685 --> 01:59:02.507]  There's going to be an attack so that they can go into Afghanistan.
[01:59:02.527 --> 01:59:03.488]  They're going to let it happen.
[01:59:03.508 --> 01:59:08.191]  I mean, if he's this bad guy, why is he on the record saying that?
[01:59:08.231 --> 01:59:08.851]  Explain that to me.
[01:59:09.572 --> 01:59:11.313]  I don't know what he said on the record, sir.
[01:59:11.373 --> 01:59:12.954]  I only know what it was like to work with him.
[01:59:13.644 --> 01:59:27.937]  And I know for a fact that many times we asked him for help, the CIA asked him for help, and they weren't interested in helping us unless we were going to bring Osama bin Laden to the United States so they could try him and get credit for the operation.
[01:59:28.761 --> 01:59:32.302]  So, I mean, are you saying FBI agents are bad to investigate bank robberies, or what are you saying?
[01:59:32.482 --> 01:59:33.462]  I think that's exactly right.
[01:59:33.482 --> 01:59:35.403]  I think they should do what they're good at.
[01:59:35.643 --> 01:59:44.585]  But first of all, I think they should get people like Judge Free and Mr. Mueller and find out why they haven't been able to buy their officers a decent computer system to get them into the 21st century.
[01:59:44.605 --> 01:59:50.106]  Well, I want to know why Free admits that he knew about all these crimes of Bill Clinton, but then writes books about it.
[01:59:50.266 --> 01:59:56.148]  He is worse than Bill Clinton because he admits he knew about it and now makes money off of it and calls himself a hero.
[01:59:56.568 --> 01:59:57.448]  Yeah, I think...
[01:59:58.208 --> 02:00:07.713]  You know, one of the great failures in American political history has been the 9-11 Commission that absolutely refused to get rid of the people or to accuse the people who were responsible for 9-11.
[02:00:07.874 --> 02:00:08.514]  Are you kidding?
[02:00:08.554 --> 02:00:09.274]  I couldn't watch it.
[02:00:09.294 --> 02:00:13.997]  They would surreptitiously worship each new little buffoon that came before them.
[02:00:14.457 --> 02:00:19.200]  Certainly Judge Free should have been one of the ones that was called to account, and he got away scot-free, sir.
[02:00:20.580 --> 02:00:21.361]  If you'll excuse the pun.
[02:00:22.341 --> 02:00:25.885]  Well, I mean, I want to know how free he admits that he knew all Clinton was committing these crimes.
[02:00:26.206 --> 02:00:30.171]  He writes a book about it, and then he isn't arrested for admitting crimes.
[02:00:30.231 --> 02:00:31.733]  It's just insane.
[02:00:34.015 --> 02:00:35.497]  That's a good word for it, sir.
[02:00:35.557 --> 02:00:35.938]  Insane.
[02:00:37.691 --> 02:00:48.196]  Well, I mean, what do you think of these announcements that there'll be local CIA agents liaisoning with local cities to fight terror, but terror is crime because crime supports terrorists?
[02:00:48.216 --> 02:00:59.802]  Well, one of the things, you know, Clinton made, I think, the huge mistake is putting law enforcement in the lead against terrorism, which just ensured that it would develop overseas.
[02:00:59.842 --> 02:01:02.323]  Please don't tell me you think we need the CIA here domestically.
[02:01:02.343 --> 02:01:02.583]  Come on.
[02:01:02.983 --> 02:01:06.185]  No, I think we should avoid the CIA domestically like grim death.
[02:01:06.937 --> 02:01:08.739]  Our job is overseas, not inside the United States.
[02:01:08.779 --> 02:01:22.350]  Well, I mean, how can our borders be wide open, and then meanwhile they're going to have some local tattletales, say in Knoxville, Tennessee, with these little federalized local citizens running around tattling on people?
[02:01:22.390 --> 02:01:26.234]  I mean, that's just... It's crazy, sir, and I think you've hit a nail on the head.
[02:01:26.274 --> 02:01:28.355]  There's two reasons why America isn't safe today.
[02:01:28.435 --> 02:01:33.480]  First, because its borders are open, and second, because the Soviet nuclear arsenal is not under control.
[02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:37.682]  Both of those things can be done by the American government tomorrow if they want to be done.
[02:01:38.282 --> 02:01:39.022]  Yeah, that's the thing.
[02:01:39.042 --> 02:01:50.248]  Our government has more money than anybody, so don't tell me that some Soviet generals for $25 million is going to sell a frog, a small artillery device, a low-yield warhead...
[02:01:52.129 --> 02:01:53.891]  That's right, sir.
[02:01:54.072 --> 02:01:55.573]  If we wanted it done, it would be done.
[02:01:55.593 --> 02:01:56.975]  Same thing with border control.
[02:01:56.995 --> 02:02:01.239]  Well, they also have sensors, as you know, that look far into the ground and can pick up radiation.
[02:02:01.279 --> 02:02:03.882]  So, boy, if one goes off, I don't know.
[02:02:03.922 --> 02:02:06.445]  It's just going to be... Do you think we're going to see a detonation?
[02:02:06.745 --> 02:02:07.586]  Oh, absolutely, sir.
[02:02:07.606 --> 02:02:09.488]  I think if bin Laden has the weapon, he'll use it.
[02:02:09.628 --> 02:02:11.531]  He certainly has been after it for more than 10 years.
[02:02:12.578 --> 02:02:16.580]  And as we know, the Soviet arsenal is not controlled, so I think it would be foolish.
[02:02:17.100 --> 02:02:17.841]  How convenient.
[02:02:17.881 --> 02:02:20.442]  And the government will get to have martial law, which they really want.
[02:02:20.802 --> 02:02:26.265]  Well, I appreciate you joining us, and I want to have you back up sometime in the future.
[02:02:26.465 --> 02:02:30.848]  And the books Imperial Hubris and Michael, have a good New Year.
[02:02:31.088 --> 02:02:31.608]  You too, sir.
[02:02:31.648 --> 02:02:33.629]  Happy New Year to you, and thank you for your kindness.
[02:02:34.069 --> 02:02:34.330]  You bet.
[02:02:34.350 --> 02:02:34.650]  Bye-bye.
[02:02:34.670 --> 02:02:34.950]  Bye-bye.
[02:02:36.291 --> 02:02:36.771]  All right.
[02:02:36.831 --> 02:02:39.752]  Well, I mean, I think that guy is saying as much as he can.
[02:02:39.772 --> 02:02:40.653]  He's in between the lines.
[02:02:41.979 --> 02:02:42.259]  Yeah.
[02:02:42.799 --> 02:02:44.760]  Now CIA is going to bomb us.
[02:02:46.220 --> 02:02:53.602]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[02:02:53.862 --> 02:02:58.603]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[02:02:58.823 --> 02:03:04.484]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[02:03:04.724 --> 02:03:09.247]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[02:03:09.467 --> 02:03:16.612]  The casual society control grid, implantable microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[02:03:16.632 --> 02:03:21.175]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[02:03:21.335 --> 02:03:23.836]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[02:03:24.077 --> 02:03:30.801]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.

[02:03:36.305 --> 02:03:36.706]  That's 888-253-3139.
[02:03:46.499 --> 02:03:51.002]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[02:03:51.362 --> 02:03:55.445]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[02:03:55.745 --> 02:03:56.286]  We listened.
[02:03:56.586 --> 02:04:01.569]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[02:04:01.849 --> 02:04:02.330]  We listened.
[02:04:02.730 --> 02:04:05.752]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[02:04:06.192 --> 02:04:06.712]  We listened.
[02:04:07.193 --> 02:04:10.535]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power
[02:04:10.595 --> 02:04:11.136]  We're good to go.
[02:04:37.073 --> 02:04:40.676]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[02:04:40.696 --> 02:04:44.218]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:04:44.938 --> 02:04:46.920]  Hey, Jack Blood here from Deadline Live.
[02:04:46.960 --> 02:04:49.861]  You know, it seems people will steal anything and everything you have.
[02:04:50.042 --> 02:04:55.425]  If you have a house with some equity, a car, a truck, RV, there was someone looking for a way to rip it off.
[02:04:55.665 --> 02:04:57.186]  And what about those government agencies?
[02:04:57.226 --> 02:04:59.467]  You know, the ones, those alphabet agencies?
[02:04:59.648 --> 02:05:03.150]  Did you know that they get raises, promotions, and bonuses based on what they see?
[02:05:03.550 --> 02:05:04.190]  We're good to go.
[02:05:26.243 --> 02:05:26.983]  We're good to go.
[02:05:27.023 --> 02:05:27.644]  We're good to go.
[02:05:50.015 --> 02:05:50.656]  Big Brother.
[02:05:51.316 --> 02:05:52.377]  Mainstream media.
[02:05:53.077 --> 02:05:54.198]  Government cover-ups.
[02:05:54.859 --> 02:05:55.679]  You want answers?
[02:05:56.420 --> 02:05:57.461]  Well, so does he.
[02:05:58.001 --> 02:06:01.964]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:02.164 --> 02:06:06.288]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:06:06.488 --> 02:06:10.291]  All right, later in the shower, I'll get into hell.
[02:06:10.931 --> 02:06:12.132]  Daryl Sharon died.
[02:06:12.532 --> 02:06:13.733]  It is a little bit suspicious.
[02:06:13.773 --> 02:06:14.274]  I mean, you'd think...
[02:06:15.288 --> 02:06:19.569]  When 400 pounds, and being 77 years old, he'd never make it that far.
[02:06:20.169 --> 02:06:22.830]  And you'd think it's natural causes, but it's got the same M.O.
[02:06:23.550 --> 02:06:26.191]  as Jeff Chakrabin, Princess Diana, all these other people.
[02:06:27.171 --> 02:06:32.373]  And I'm not saying that he didn't die of natural causes, but it is suspicious that... Well, we'll get into that later.
[02:06:32.413 --> 02:06:33.793]  It'll take a few minutes to talk about it.
[02:06:34.053 --> 02:06:35.994]  He did die a few hours ago, in case you didn't know.
[02:06:37.265 --> 02:06:39.287]  And then we'll also... I got this clip.
[02:06:39.668 --> 02:06:44.493]  There are these new trendy groups where they're all getting the impenetrable microchip because they're so cool.
[02:06:45.014 --> 02:06:46.335]  That was the Pentagon plan.
[02:06:48.177 --> 02:06:50.520]  Six years ago, I remember reading it.
[02:06:50.540 --> 02:06:53.523]  They said we're going to use fads to condition the public to take impenetrable microchips.
[02:06:54.103 --> 02:06:58.088]  I know, it sounds like a late-night Outer Limits episode, but it's really happening.
[02:06:59.235 --> 02:07:01.879]  And again, the big story is the Pentagon said they were going to do this.
[02:07:01.939 --> 02:07:09.229]  And then I had a Washington Post writer on three years ago saying, oh yeah, industry's going to use the body modification crowd to say it's trendy to push it.
[02:07:09.489 --> 02:07:10.871]  I mean, this is public.
[02:07:10.911 --> 02:07:12.794]  This is Washington Post, U.S.
[02:07:12.894 --> 02:07:13.855]  Army website.
[02:07:13.895 --> 02:07:14.336]  I mean, this is...
[02:07:16.637 --> 02:07:18.978]  The Army's not just spying on us, folks.
[02:07:18.998 --> 02:07:22.220]  They're propagandizing us to take microchips.
[02:07:22.280 --> 02:07:23.400]  Okay, I'm already getting into that.
[02:07:23.680 --> 02:07:25.321]  It's come up to about 30, 40 minutes or so.
[02:07:25.341 --> 02:07:26.722]  I'm near the end of the broadcast.
[02:07:26.742 --> 02:07:32.524]  I want to play this clip of them talking about how trendy they are because they've got the chip.
[02:07:32.544 --> 02:07:37.747]  I mean, if you told them it was trendy to take cyanide pills, they'd probably start gobbling them.
[02:07:38.434 --> 02:07:39.955]  Oh, look, it's so trendy to die.
[02:07:39.995 --> 02:07:41.095]  Look at him convulsing.
[02:07:41.936 --> 02:07:43.656]  Oh, it's so trendy to jump off a cliff.
[02:07:43.676 --> 02:07:44.997]  I mean, it's just idiocy.
[02:07:45.457 --> 02:07:48.078]  It's trendy to be into freedom, you twits.
[02:07:49.079 --> 02:07:49.619]  All right, I'm sorry.
[02:07:49.639 --> 02:07:50.399]  I'm going to stop right there.
[02:07:51.240 --> 02:07:52.140]  I'm going to stop right there.
[02:07:56.022 --> 02:08:01.184]  We are two hours, ten minutes, and 14 seconds into the show today, and I have not plugged my videos yet.
[02:08:02.725 --> 02:08:07.607]  And they're some of the best tools we've got to wake the American people up.
[02:08:09.820 --> 02:08:11.821]  And they are just amazing.
[02:08:11.861 --> 02:08:12.641]  You need to have them.
[02:08:12.681 --> 02:08:19.763]  My new film, Martial Law, covers how the globalists engage in terror attacks against the American people to bring in a one-world government.
[02:08:20.824 --> 02:08:25.986]  You just heard I had another chief CIA analyst on admitting our government's carried out terror attacks to blame it on people.
[02:08:26.646 --> 02:08:30.007]  I mean, what is it, every other day now we're going to have a high-level, you know...
[02:08:30.943 --> 02:08:31.984]  People want to tell you that?
[02:08:32.104 --> 02:08:34.885]  I mean, Ray McGovern said it, said our government may carry out attacks.
[02:08:34.925 --> 02:08:36.546]  Well, they have carried out attacks.
[02:08:37.086 --> 02:08:41.829]  And we have got it chronicled in Road to Tyranny, in Martial Law, in Masters of Terror.
[02:08:42.329 --> 02:08:51.974]  If you've got these videos and haven't made copies or haven't put them on local cable access or haven't showed them to your VFW hall or haven't showed them at the library or haven't, then you need to.
[02:08:52.074 --> 02:08:53.955]  If you haven't made copies of them, you need to.
[02:08:53.995 --> 02:08:59.398]  And if you haven't gotten them, you need to get them from us for another three days.
[02:09:00.891 --> 02:09:01.913]  Well, even less than that.
[02:09:02.354 --> 02:09:15.375]  Just for a couple days, until early next week, because we won't change the specials until Monday, folks, you can get PrisonPlanet.tv membership for 15 cents a day, a monthly subscription.

[02:09:45.201 --> 02:09:46.281]  Almost half a year free.
[02:09:47.102 --> 02:09:54.386]  Just a few days shy of that for when you get a yearly membership.

[02:10:07.541 --> 02:10:11.223]  Well, we really are going crazy here, because I just want to get the material out the door.
[02:10:11.683 --> 02:10:14.244]  The books, the videos, everything's discounted.

[02:10:19.705 --> 02:10:21.746]  I want to affect change.
[02:10:22.206 --> 02:10:30.969]  And we're expanding the business, we're expanding the fight, we're expanding the employees we have here, we're expanding the films we make, we are expanding everything.
[02:10:31.588 --> 02:10:47.899]  And so we are just blowing it all out to capitalize to even do a better job and to put up more websites and make better films and to carry more materials and more inventory and other videos and books by other great authors and researchers.

[02:11:01.787 --> 02:11:02.727]  That's 888-253-3139.
[02:11:02.747 --> 02:11:07.969]  Or just write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, L-A-M-A-R, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 787-04.
[02:11:08.009 --> 02:11:11.771]  Alright, without further ado, he's been holding about three minutes, is our guest.
[02:11:26.767 --> 02:11:32.689]  And he is John... Why are our wonderful guest names never easy?
[02:11:32.729 --> 02:11:34.429]  I was pronouncing it right five minutes ago.
[02:11:34.909 --> 02:11:36.269]  John Babiars.
[02:11:36.870 --> 02:11:39.690]  And he is the chair of the Libertarian Party of New Hampshire.
[02:11:40.130 --> 02:11:41.071]  Live free or die state.
[02:11:41.671 --> 02:11:44.111]  And they're pushing Bill 1639-FN, which would prohibit...
[02:11:46.372 --> 02:12:01.157]  The confiscation of lawfully owned and lawfully carried firearms during a state of emergency and make a felony of any public servant peace officer, I wouldn't call him law enforcement officer, who attempts to seize any firearm during a disaster as well as officials, as they call them, again public servants.
[02:12:01.497 --> 02:12:03.418]  And we are honored to have you on with us, John.
[02:12:03.798 --> 02:12:04.458]  Well, thank you, Alex.
[02:12:05.217 --> 02:12:05.958]  You bet.
[02:12:05.978 --> 02:12:07.439]  Just right what you guys are doing.
[02:12:08.099 --> 02:12:12.843]  I'm glad you guys took seriously what was happening in New Orleans and surrounding areas.
[02:12:13.223 --> 02:12:15.305]  For those that aren't aware of it, why don't you fill us in on it?
[02:12:15.865 --> 02:12:16.205]  Sure.
[02:12:16.285 --> 02:12:32.718]  In New Orleans, what happens is local police chief in New Orleans, who I guess he isn't there anymore, started this process of confiscating weapons from law-abiding citizens, trying to protect themselves, thus leaving them unprotected and exposed to the ravages of criminals.
[02:12:33.678 --> 02:12:34.299]  Outrageous.
[02:12:34.379 --> 02:12:39.004]  Well, in New Hampshire, we saw that and said, wow, they think they could pull that stunt?
[02:12:39.124 --> 02:12:41.006]  Well, we've got to do something to protect ourselves.
[02:12:41.046 --> 02:12:42.027]  So, hence this bill.
[02:12:42.647 --> 02:12:49.735]  One of the things that our Constitution doesn't have provisions is punishment for officials who violate our rights.
[02:12:51.096 --> 02:12:55.618]  And so with this new bill that's before the committee... You know, that's an idea, though.
[02:12:55.758 --> 02:13:02.461]  Criminalizing, not just making it civil where they can be thrown out or impeached, but criminalizing, because they love to write laws for us.
[02:13:02.881 --> 02:13:05.722]  Absolutely criminalize their criminal activity.
[02:13:06.443 --> 02:13:07.803]  Oh, definitely, definitely.
[02:13:07.883 --> 02:13:09.524]  I mean, the beauty of this is...
[02:13:10.006 --> 02:13:21.955]  It shall be punishable by a fine of not less than $5,000, a letter of reprimand by the violator's chief presiding law enforcement officer, and imprisonment for not less than 30 days in a state correctional facility.
[02:13:22.456 --> 02:13:25.218]  Yeah, I'd like to see him deported to China.
[02:13:27.042 --> 02:13:28.764]  No, they might learn something valuable.
[02:13:28.784 --> 02:13:29.525]  Here's the problem.
[02:13:29.565 --> 02:13:31.166]  A federal judge, and we tracked this.
[02:13:32.067 --> 02:13:33.708]  We even had some people on from the court.
[02:13:33.728 --> 02:13:37.011]  A federal judge said that that was illegal, what they were doing, and blocked them.
[02:13:37.251 --> 02:13:38.051]  They didn't stop.
[02:13:38.132 --> 02:13:40.073]  They just slowed down and then kind of tapered off.
[02:13:41.314 --> 02:13:43.976]  And the people haven't gotten their guns back.
[02:13:44.036 --> 02:13:49.521]  So these slobs don't even care about when it's openly a judge's saying they're doing something criminal.
[02:13:50.575 --> 02:13:50.795]  Right.
[02:13:50.855 --> 02:13:53.177]  In New Hampshire, we don't put up with that kind of stuff.
[02:13:53.197 --> 02:13:56.800]  You've got to remember, the American Revolution started here in December of 1774.
[02:13:57.100 --> 02:14:01.263]  We threw the British out of the Fourth Constitution.
[02:14:01.303 --> 02:14:02.784]  They came to take the guns.
[02:14:03.945 --> 02:14:05.166]  Actually, we went to take their guns.
[02:14:05.766 --> 02:14:07.107]  But, I mean, that's what started the war.
[02:14:07.207 --> 02:14:07.988]  Oh, definitely.
[02:14:08.288 --> 02:14:08.809]  Gun grabbing.
[02:14:09.169 --> 02:14:09.690]  Oh, definitely.
[02:14:09.730 --> 02:14:11.331]  That's what started the whole thing, in fact.
[02:14:11.651 --> 02:14:13.093]  That's what started it here in Texas.
[02:14:13.113 --> 02:14:16.095]  Man, these are shooting stuff.
[02:14:16.115 --> 02:14:18.077]  I mean, this isn't a game.
[02:14:18.157 --> 02:14:20.979]  America was born in, you gonna take my gun?
[02:14:21.180 --> 02:14:22.461]  Man, you gonna die!
[02:14:24.042 --> 02:14:25.323]  That is correct.
[02:14:25.683 --> 02:14:28.106]  There's one thing, he tried to make a man defenseless.
[02:14:29.429 --> 02:14:30.990]  A real man will stand up and fight.
[02:14:31.350 --> 02:14:34.371]  A coward will just get down on his knees and kiss your feet.
[02:14:34.511 --> 02:14:36.431]  Well, in New Hampshire, we don't kiss feet around here.
[02:14:36.451 --> 02:14:38.492]  Yeah, I got news for these black-suited monkeys.
[02:14:38.532 --> 02:14:39.452]  I'm not your slave.
[02:14:40.713 --> 02:14:41.273]  That's for sure.
[02:14:42.233 --> 02:14:43.433]  And look, folks, we should be mad.
[02:14:43.473 --> 02:14:46.995]  And look, cops, if you're pro-gun, which I know most of you are, then start talking about it.
[02:14:47.255 --> 02:14:48.035]  Start speaking out.
[02:14:48.055 --> 02:14:50.516]  Don't let your police chief speak for you.
[02:14:50.936 --> 02:14:53.096]  You don't want to be called black-suited monkeys?
[02:14:53.377 --> 02:14:55.597]  I'll call you great Americans if you just join us.
[02:14:55.897 --> 02:14:56.898]  But you better pick a side.
[02:14:56.918 --> 02:14:57.818]  Do you agree with that statement?
[02:14:59.103 --> 02:15:04.407]  Yes, in fact, you know, the police chief in these areas, I mean, dynamite guys.
[02:15:05.048 --> 02:15:08.531]  In fact, they kind of expect you to have your guns with you, which is great.
[02:15:09.071 --> 02:15:13.355]  I know this is New England, hard to believe, but... I need to move to New Hampshire or Vermont.
[02:15:13.415 --> 02:15:14.797]  Texas is just pathetic now.
[02:15:14.817 --> 02:15:17.159]  I mean, my family's been here to Spanish land grants.
[02:15:17.199 --> 02:15:22.063]  I mean, we're as Texan as it gets, and I'm telling you, we've turned into this possum-bellied jellyfish.
[02:15:23.204 --> 02:15:25.326]  I guess they forgot the Alamo, huh?
[02:15:26.189 --> 02:15:27.590]  They forgot what happened.
[02:15:27.610 --> 02:15:31.652]  The war started when the Mexican Army came to take guns.
[02:15:34.114 --> 02:15:34.314]  Yeah.
[02:15:35.014 --> 02:15:38.917]  I mean, we are just a... We ought to be ashamed of ourselves.
[02:15:38.937 --> 02:15:40.638]  You ought to be proud of yourselves up in New Hampshire.
[02:15:40.918 --> 02:15:41.498]  Oh, we are.
[02:15:41.598 --> 02:15:43.159]  We are, and we just keep going forward.
[02:15:43.199 --> 02:15:44.380]  In fact, we're...
[02:15:45.211 --> 02:15:52.260]  In our warrant article that we're putting up in Grafton here, we're actually going to have a warrant article to make Grafton a United Nations free zone.
[02:15:52.520 --> 02:15:56.344]  Just missed being passed a couple years ago by 10 votes, but I think this time we're going to make it.
[02:15:56.364 --> 02:15:57.386]  Oh, the UN free zones?
[02:15:57.446 --> 02:15:57.666]  Yeah.
[02:15:58.006 --> 02:15:58.827]  Those are beautiful.
[02:15:59.909 --> 02:16:01.611]  Are you doing that through Michael Nugent's group?
[02:16:01.971 --> 02:16:03.192]  No, we're just doing it ourselves.
[02:16:03.593 --> 02:16:04.354]  Oh, that's wonderful.
[02:16:04.634 --> 02:16:09.518]  In fact, three weeks ago in Keene, New Hampshire, a bunch of activists burnt the U.N.
[02:16:09.558 --> 02:16:11.660]  flag in public in the city park.
[02:16:12.500 --> 02:16:14.262]  Oh, please send me video of that.
[02:16:14.282 --> 02:16:15.402]  I'd love to put it on my website.
[02:16:15.543 --> 02:16:20.607]  Actually, you go to NewHampshireFree.com and you'll see the activists actually burning it on there, the pictures there.
[02:16:20.827 --> 02:16:22.088]  Please say the website five times.
[02:16:22.848 --> 02:16:24.349]  NewHampshireFree.com.
[02:16:24.590 --> 02:16:25.710]  NHFree.com.
[02:16:26.991 --> 02:16:28.733]  So it's just NH... Free...
[02:16:30.758 --> 02:16:32.099]  No space, no nothing.
[02:16:32.119 --> 02:16:34.641]  NHFree.com, NHFree.com.
[02:16:35.661 --> 02:16:36.862]  Oh, I tell you, it's just wonderful.
[02:16:36.942 --> 02:16:37.763]  Oh, I love it.
[02:16:37.783 --> 02:16:39.584]  I mean, it's simple, too.
[02:16:39.604 --> 02:16:40.265]  It gets attention.
[02:16:40.285 --> 02:16:43.968]  You go out, you burn a UN flag, local media comes out and covers it.
[02:16:44.568 --> 02:16:46.930]  One time, though, they had a guy who didn't like us come.
[02:16:46.950 --> 02:16:48.111]  We had about 100 people out there.
[02:16:48.131 --> 02:16:49.172]  This was like 10 years ago.
[02:16:49.192 --> 02:16:50.873]  You've got to find that video.
[02:16:51.473 --> 02:16:55.937]  And the police come over and say, you're not allowed to burn the flag as a burn ban.
[02:16:57.040 --> 02:16:57.680]  No, definitely, definitely.
[02:17:21.798 --> 02:17:22.819]  I mean, they are sick.
[02:17:23.540 --> 02:17:29.026]  Well, the thing of it is, and the key is to read up on that nhfree.com.
[02:17:29.046 --> 02:17:33.872]  You'll find that the head of the parks didn't want to do it, but there was no law against using the fire pit.
[02:17:34.012 --> 02:17:37.255]  And in New Hampshire, when the snow's on the ground, you can burn anything you want.
[02:17:37.576 --> 02:17:40.619]  You know, that's another time we did use a fire pit because it was a burn ban.
[02:17:41.660 --> 02:17:42.081]  Stay there.
[02:17:42.101 --> 02:17:43.042]  I love the fire pits.
[02:17:46.064 --> 02:17:46.704]  We're good to go.
[02:17:46.744 --> 02:17:47.225]  We're good to go.
[02:18:08.476 --> 02:18:09.116]  We're good to go.
[02:18:27.361 --> 02:18:27.842]  We're good to go.
[02:18:45.811 --> 02:18:52.033]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[02:18:52.493 --> 02:19:00.255]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[02:19:00.616 --> 02:19:08.438]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[02:19:08.778 --> 02:19:09.639]  We're good to go.
[02:19:28.820 --> 02:19:29.341]  That's 1-800-686-2237

[02:20:49.038 --> 02:20:50.479]  I'm your host, Joe Java.
[02:20:50.619 --> 02:20:53.259]  Today we're talking about guilt-free healthy coffee.
[02:20:53.519 --> 02:20:56.160]  Yes, it is possible to enjoy healthy coffee.
[02:20:56.440 --> 02:20:59.001]  And on today's episode, we're going to tell you how.
[02:20:59.201 --> 02:21:00.241]  More after this break.
[02:21:01.249 --> 02:21:01.870]  We're good to go.
[02:21:01.930 --> 02:21:02.130]  I think?
[02:21:21.645 --> 02:21:23.367]  Welcome back to Coffee on the Air.
[02:21:23.607 --> 02:21:26.910]  I'm Joe Java with news that you can enjoy guilt-free coffee.

[02:21:46.831 --> 02:21:51.974]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:21:52.634 --> 02:21:55.036]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:21:56.316 --> 02:21:58.097]  John Babieras is our guest.
[02:21:58.938 --> 02:22:00.579]  Listen, we love to heat praise on people that...
[02:22:01.281 --> 02:22:03.221]  We want to be friends with the police and the government.
[02:22:03.441 --> 02:22:05.542]  The government's out of control with a bunch of cops.
[02:22:05.582 --> 02:22:07.242]  You know the politicians are crooks.
[02:22:07.762 --> 02:22:09.002]  And they're doing bad things.
[02:22:09.042 --> 02:22:09.942]  And we're not going to put up with it.
[02:22:10.283 --> 02:22:11.003]  What are we fighting?
[02:22:11.043 --> 02:22:12.243]  Here's a clip from ABC News.
[02:22:12.263 --> 02:22:12.823]  You've heard it before.
[02:22:12.843 --> 02:22:13.583]  We'll play it again.
[02:22:14.163 --> 02:22:16.144]  Where they're confiscating the guns with the U.S.
[02:22:16.184 --> 02:22:16.664]  military.
[02:22:16.704 --> 02:22:17.184]  Here it is.
[02:22:21.304 --> 02:22:24.165]  Today in New Orleans, they got a lot tougher on the holdouts.
[02:22:26.365 --> 02:22:30.186]  Not only the flooded areas, but New Orleans' driest and wealthiest neighborhoods, too.
[02:22:34.018 --> 02:22:42.900]  The police and National Guard going street by street, house to house.
[02:22:46.820 --> 02:22:50.541]  They say there are no orders to use force, just strong persuasion.
[02:22:50.881 --> 02:22:53.441]  Sometimes entering open houses with guns drawn.
[02:22:54.802 --> 02:22:57.102]  Instructions to disarm anyone inside.
[02:22:58.162 --> 02:22:59.963]  You say guns will be taken?
[02:23:00.003 --> 02:23:01.063]  No one will be able to be armed.
[02:23:01.323 --> 02:23:02.323]  We will take all weapons.
[02:23:02.998 --> 02:23:07.980]  That happened today in this wealthy neighborhood where homeowners had armed themselves to protect their mansions.
[02:23:09.881 --> 02:23:11.722]  Residents were handcuffed on the ground.
[02:23:12.202 --> 02:23:15.364]  In the end, police took their weapons but let them stay in their homes.
[02:23:15.864 --> 02:23:18.665]  They were a little bit threatened because our weapons were bigger than their weapons.
[02:23:20.306 --> 02:23:22.087]  So it goes on and on.
[02:23:22.247 --> 02:23:25.709]  But the thing is, I've been to the drills.
[02:23:25.769 --> 02:23:30.651]  The government really is trying to create cadres of police and military that will go in and take guns house to house.
[02:23:31.460 --> 02:23:32.821]  I mean, this is really the plan.
[02:23:32.881 --> 02:23:45.348]  The first chance they got, foreign troops, Dutch, Mexican, backing them up, and then private security agencies, mercenaries, the police, the military, regular army, FBI squads, and big flatback trucks.
[02:23:46.008 --> 02:23:47.809]  I mean, and folks, I see million-dollar houses.
[02:23:47.929 --> 02:23:50.951]  On that video, these are houses that look like the White House.
[02:23:50.971 --> 02:23:53.352]  I mean, these are mansions built, you know, in the 1800s.
[02:23:53.392 --> 02:23:57.674]  I mean, these are 20, 30-room things, and these are rich people.
[02:23:57.754 --> 02:23:57.954]  I mean...
[02:23:59.395 --> 02:23:59.996]  Well, it's outrageous, Ian.
[02:24:00.016 --> 02:24:00.136]  Look,
[02:24:24.588 --> 02:24:28.394]  The reason why they want to use foreign troops is American troops won't do it.
[02:24:28.754 --> 02:24:31.017]  And it becomes a conflict.
[02:24:31.318 --> 02:24:32.900]  Do Americans shoot Americans?
[02:24:32.960 --> 02:24:33.220]  No.
[02:24:33.621 --> 02:24:34.983]  But you put foreign troops in.
[02:24:35.003 --> 02:24:37.046]  The foreign troops have no qualm about shooting us.
[02:24:37.086 --> 02:24:37.687]  Well, guess what?
[02:24:38.115 --> 02:24:42.640]  In return, we Americans have no qualms in shooting anybody wearing blue helmets.
[02:24:43.120 --> 02:24:45.163]  And by the way, folks, this isn't a joke.
[02:24:45.543 --> 02:24:55.614]  It's been a stated long-term plan, that's why we've been talking about it so long, to incrementally bring in foreign troops to fight fires, use NATO AWACS, bring in some Germans.
[02:24:55.934 --> 02:24:57.795]  They're just trying to slide it in.
[02:24:57.955 --> 02:25:02.976]  And notice they went to the rich people's houses, because I guess they had to weigh, well, do I want to risk my fortune?
[02:25:03.016 --> 02:25:04.917]  And it comes back to what Sam Adams said.
[02:25:04.937 --> 02:25:07.558]  If you love wealth better than liberty, tranquility of servitude,
[02:25:25.316 --> 02:25:27.077]  We're better than the animated contest of freedom.
[02:25:27.757 --> 02:25:29.078]  Go home from us in peace.
[02:25:29.138 --> 02:25:31.139]  We seek neither your counsel nor your arms.
[02:25:31.439 --> 02:25:33.219]  Crouch down and lick the hand which feeds you.
[02:25:34.680 --> 02:25:36.441]  May a chain set upon you lightly.
[02:25:36.741 --> 02:25:38.762]  May posterity forget that you are a countryman.
[02:25:39.492 --> 02:25:40.172]  Well, I know this.
[02:25:40.212 --> 02:25:46.236]  I'm not going to say that if they came in, say, New Orleans to do it, number one, I wouldn't answer the door.
[02:25:46.256 --> 02:25:50.138]  If they came in with a SWAT team, which they would do, who knows what would happen.
[02:25:50.898 --> 02:25:55.921]  I might just wait and personally get all their names and sue them for the rest of their lives and put billboards up across the
[02:25:56.141 --> 02:26:01.806]  Well, up here in New Hampshire, we had an ice storm about seven years ago that really devastated the place.
[02:26:01.826 --> 02:26:03.928]  We were out of power ten days or whatever.
[02:26:03.948 --> 02:26:04.068]  Well,
[02:26:24.381 --> 02:26:27.885]  One of the FEMA officials commandeered the firehouse to, quote, save us.
[02:26:28.385 --> 02:26:29.186]  Nobody showed up.
[02:26:29.226 --> 02:26:32.329]  We were all taking care of ourselves just fine without the federal government.
[02:26:33.647 --> 02:26:35.288]  So that's how we are in New Hampshire.
[02:26:35.508 --> 02:26:38.311]  We're kind of tough people, and we take care of our own.
[02:26:38.351 --> 02:26:39.531]  We know what FEMA did.
[02:26:39.591 --> 02:26:42.954]  FEMA clearly, on purpose, sabotaged the police and everybody.
[02:26:42.994 --> 02:26:43.714]  That's now public.
[02:26:43.774 --> 02:26:47.217]  I mean, they've got three sheriffs who have gone public and an emergency manager.
[02:26:47.517 --> 02:26:54.602]  They had to put armed police on key facilities to stop FEMA from not coming and commandeering, coming and bashing everything up.
[02:26:55.363 --> 02:26:55.903]  Oh, definitely.
[02:26:56.764 --> 02:27:00.827]  We have a member of the Libertarian Party that went down to help the people, and he told us,
[02:27:01.192 --> 02:27:08.895]  The incompetence of FEMA and how the private organizations were doing a heck of a better job because they were touching Americans on Americans.
[02:27:09.575 --> 02:27:10.775]  It's not even incompetence.
[02:27:10.795 --> 02:27:11.716]  Let me ask you a question, John.
[02:27:11.736 --> 02:27:12.456]  You're a smart guy.
[02:27:12.476 --> 02:27:14.157]  And answer it after the break.
[02:27:14.837 --> 02:27:17.918]  Does FEMA get more power and funding if things go well in New Orleans?
[02:27:18.038 --> 02:27:21.940]  Or if everything screws up really bad, will they get more power and funding?
[02:27:21.980 --> 02:27:22.980]  I think you know the answer.
[02:27:23.664 --> 02:27:26.346]  I mean, look, they jam communications, they cut lines.
[02:27:26.426 --> 02:27:27.306]  That isn't incompetence.
[02:27:27.627 --> 02:27:31.389]  They engage in sabotage to make the local police look incompetent.
[02:27:35.852 --> 02:27:36.752]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.233 --> 02:27:38.854]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.754 --> 02:27:42.436]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[02:28:44.919 --> 02:28:47.942]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[02:28:48.263 --> 02:28:53.187]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[02:28:53.428 --> 02:28:57.692]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[02:28:58.072 --> 02:29:06.976]  The KDF Shower Filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[02:29:07.197 --> 02:29:10.818]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[02:29:11.118 --> 02:29:16.141]  The KDF Shower Filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[02:29:16.441 --> 02:29:23.164]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[02:29:23.645 --> 02:29:24.185]  What about you?

[02:29:45.626 --> 02:29:48.928]  In the past few years, millions of Americans have made the switch to natural products.
[02:29:49.289 --> 02:29:54.572]  Herbs, minerals, vitamins, and essential oils are now being recognized as the safest and most effective products in the quest for good health.
[02:29:54.812 --> 02:29:56.673]  Introducing Vitamir Mouthwash and Toothpaste.
[02:29:57.014 --> 02:30:01.537]  Vitamir has created unique and natural patented formulas that set them apart from any other oral hygiene products.
[02:30:01.757 --> 02:30:08.161]  The folks at Vitamir have blended zinc, folic acid, myrrh, and clove oil into gentle but effective products that freshen your breath and fight gum disease.
[02:30:08.361 --> 02:30:09.362]  Good health starts in your mouth.
[02:30:09.542 --> 02:30:18.710]  And regular use of Vitamir toothpaste and mouthwash is a powerful front-line defense against gingivitis, bleeding gums, and folks with braces or dentures will love that clean, fresh, just-from-the-dentist-office feeling.
[02:30:18.931 --> 02:30:22.294]  And once you've tried Vitamir, you just may find that no other toothpaste or mouthwash will do.

[02:30:37.251 --> 02:30:40.778]  Try Vitamir and you'll feel that squeaky clean sensation others just talk about.
[02:30:51.531 --> 02:30:52.952]  John Baviera is our guest.
[02:30:52.972 --> 02:30:56.535]  We're going to take two calls from Eric and Ron and then I'm going to get into Ariel Sharon.
[02:30:56.555 --> 02:30:59.517]  I've also got another article here where people are trendy.
[02:30:59.557 --> 02:31:01.639]  They've got microchips and you don't.
[02:31:02.059 --> 02:31:02.799]  You're an idiot.
[02:31:03.300 --> 02:31:04.641]  You're so cool.
[02:31:04.661 --> 02:31:07.003]  Tragically hip is the proper term.
[02:31:07.243 --> 02:31:09.625]  My dad told me about that phrase many years ago.
[02:31:09.665 --> 02:31:10.405]  Tragically hip.
[02:31:11.126 --> 02:31:12.287]  So hip they're idiots.
[02:31:12.867 --> 02:31:13.067]  But...
[02:31:15.100 --> 02:31:19.501]  I tell you, when it gets down to gun confiscation, this is really what's going on.
[02:31:20.442 --> 02:31:34.766]  I remember right before 9-11, two weeks before 9-11, New Hampshire already had the majority of the townships, the select men and women, ready to pull out of the union because of the federal government's activities.
[02:31:34.786 --> 02:31:35.766]  Do you remember that, John?
[02:31:36.226 --> 02:31:43.048]  Yes, in fact, a couple towns were already in the process of making the plans for a succession.
[02:31:44.114 --> 02:31:49.916]  And had a majority vote, but that didn't... Suddenly, I guess that got dropped after 9-11.
[02:31:50.337 --> 02:31:50.917]  Yes, it did.
[02:31:51.757 --> 02:31:59.460]  I guess people pulled together and thought about the country under attack, but you know... Well, you know, the states can actually pull out to whatever extent they wish.
[02:31:59.540 --> 02:32:06.343]  It could just simply pull out of the regulatory control and declare a Tenth Amendment and still be part of the United States.
[02:32:06.363 --> 02:32:07.984]  There could be a limited secession.
[02:32:08.584 --> 02:32:09.224]  That is correct.
[02:32:09.284 --> 02:32:09.925]  In fact, the...
[02:32:11.215 --> 02:32:14.538]  The federal government is in states only by invitation of the governor.
[02:32:14.878 --> 02:32:19.202]  All it takes is the governor strong enough to say, you know, we want you to leave.
[02:32:19.402 --> 02:32:25.807]  South Carolina actually almost did that over the unfair tariffs that were just on their goods, not on Northern manufactured goods.
[02:32:25.867 --> 02:32:33.053]  And if Jackson would have, it was one of his only mistakes, if Jackson would have let them do that, we would not have had a civil war.
[02:32:33.073 --> 02:32:35.375]  That's correct.
[02:32:36.276 --> 02:32:40.159]  It was about trade and tariffs, but they drag everything else into it.
[02:32:40.769 --> 02:32:45.390]  Well, I mean, the president at the time said it wasn't about slavery.
[02:32:45.410 --> 02:32:46.630]  That's a red herring, folks.
[02:32:46.670 --> 02:32:50.171]  Slavery was already being phased out, not defending that horrible institution.
[02:32:50.551 --> 02:32:51.311]  Okay, side issue.
[02:32:51.331 --> 02:32:52.431]  I'm going to take a few calls here.
[02:32:52.731 --> 02:32:55.412]  How do we help you guys get HB 1639?
[02:32:55.452 --> 02:32:57.672]  I didn't give you a heads up on this.
[02:32:57.952 --> 02:33:02.733]  You got a statehouse website or got any phone numbers or how we can help you guys?
[02:33:02.973 --> 02:33:05.394]  How do we help you pass anti-UN resolutions?
[02:33:05.954 --> 02:33:12.659]  Well, the anti-UN resolution is a local activity here, and we're going forth on that, and that's going to proceed okay.
[02:33:13.500 --> 02:33:21.725]  On the House bill, one of the state reps that actually put this in, Representative McNell, is president of Gun Owners New Hampshire.
[02:33:22.266 --> 02:33:28.290]  And unlike the NRA, Gun Owners New Hampshire here is a fierce group, no compromise, all the way to the wall.
[02:33:28.811 --> 02:33:28.911]  And...
[02:33:30.147 --> 02:33:37.469]  The committee this is in front of, I suspect it's going to have a wide turnout, and I think it's going to come out of the committee off the path.
[02:33:38.009 --> 02:33:56.714]  You know, the First Amendment and the Second Amendment are really the two only amendments that aren't being absolutely violated right now, though they're trying to gobble them up, and some areas have gotten rid of the Second Amendment, areas of California, New York, and other areas, and of course you have the highest crime rates in those sectors, because all the criminals flock there like maggots to dead meat, literally, but...
[02:34:00.006 --> 02:34:05.868]  The only reason we still have those is those are the two rights that Americans still remember they have and are willing to fight for.
[02:34:05.888 --> 02:34:10.991]  I mean, we are like a bunch of rabid piranhas when it comes to the Second Amendment, but not enough.
[02:34:11.011 --> 02:34:15.032]  We need to get rabid and start erasing these unconstitutional abominations.
[02:34:15.713 --> 02:34:16.293]  That is correct.
[02:34:16.353 --> 02:34:21.415]  And in New Hampshire, we only have a handful of gun laws, and they're getting reduced every year.
[02:34:21.855 --> 02:34:23.936]  We have the right to open carry.
[02:34:24.156 --> 02:34:26.037]  You're the second best next to Vermont.
[02:34:26.915 --> 02:34:27.215]  I know.
[02:34:27.376 --> 02:34:31.119]  And even the permit for concealed carry is shell issue.
[02:34:32.060 --> 02:34:35.402]  You pay your $10 fee, they cannot photograph you, they cannot fingerprint you.
[02:34:35.422 --> 02:34:39.966]  You just put in the application, and within 10 business days, they must issue it to you.
[02:34:40.126 --> 02:34:45.911]  But what you need is just the right to carry just automatic, which is what Vermont has.
[02:34:45.971 --> 02:34:46.552]  Yeah.
[02:34:46.792 --> 02:34:48.113]  Vermont's nice.
[02:34:48.313 --> 02:34:50.275]  It's nice living in a state where I can go from...
[02:34:50.595 --> 02:34:52.996]  New Hampshire to Vermont, and not have to worry about it.
[02:34:53.016 --> 02:34:57.717]  If I go down south to Massachusetts, I... You know, maybe I ought to... Have I ever made enough money?
[02:34:57.757 --> 02:35:04.479]  Maybe I ought to live there in the summer and the fall and spring and just come down here to Texas in the winter.
[02:35:04.499 --> 02:35:06.259]  No, I'm serious.
[02:35:06.299 --> 02:35:07.619]  I'm getting so sick of these allergies.
[02:35:07.779 --> 02:35:09.820]  I'm letting everybody know I may move in a couple years.
[02:35:10.723 --> 02:35:16.965]  Well, if you want to go to a state that believes in its freedom, that is fighting fair sport, New Hampshire is the place.
[02:35:17.245 --> 02:35:19.266]  It was chosen by the Free State Project.
[02:35:19.306 --> 02:35:21.707]  We have a lot of activists moving into the area.
[02:35:21.967 --> 02:35:22.647]  No, I may move.
[02:35:22.707 --> 02:35:23.187]  I may leave.
[02:35:23.908 --> 02:35:24.688]  I'm really sick of it.
[02:35:24.708 --> 02:35:26.509]  I don't want to be around a bunch of cowardly weaklings.
[02:35:27.889 --> 02:35:29.390]  I'll probably move to Vermont or something.
[02:35:29.790 --> 02:35:31.010]  I just can't handle it anymore.
[02:35:31.250 --> 02:35:32.831]  I just can't do it.
[02:35:32.951 --> 02:35:33.991]  I'm not trying to sound mean.
[02:35:34.011 --> 02:35:34.691]  I'm just serious.
[02:35:34.752 --> 02:35:35.992]  I don't want to be around this anymore.
[02:35:36.926 --> 02:35:39.147]  You've got all these people that think they're free, and they're not.
[02:35:39.187 --> 02:35:45.250]  I mean, we're going to have the trans nap to highway with transponders and all of our inspection stickers.
[02:35:46.271 --> 02:35:49.132]  We are going to try to pass even more gun laws.
[02:35:49.973 --> 02:35:55.956]  It's just horrible to see my state, which my family's been in since the beginning, just disappearing.
[02:35:58.797 --> 02:36:00.458]  Watching it torn apart right in front of my eyes.
[02:36:00.718 --> 02:36:03.480]  But really, you guys are aggressive up in New Hampshire and Vermont.
[02:36:03.500 --> 02:36:05.741]  I mean, I can only salute you.
[02:36:06.286 --> 02:36:16.152]  Well, we thank you, but we're still going forward, and if it's going to begin like it began in 1774, it'll begin right here in New Hampshire again.
[02:36:16.332 --> 02:36:22.076]  How can you guys be so free, and there's such pathetic jellyfish in Massachusetts and New York?
[02:36:22.576 --> 02:36:25.358]  Well, the winters are tough and cold up here, but you know what?
[02:36:25.398 --> 02:36:26.999]  If you can take that, you can take anything.
[02:36:28.860 --> 02:36:29.580]  That's the way it is.
[02:36:29.821 --> 02:36:35.204]  But, I mean, Minnesota winters are even tougher, and you don't see people, a bunch of jellyfish up there.
[02:36:35.224 --> 02:36:41.507]  Well, it could be our Constitution, which puts our Bill of Rights first, and then the form of government.
[02:36:41.687 --> 02:36:42.768]  I think it really is the people.
[02:36:42.808 --> 02:36:44.889]  You guys have still got some semblance of heritage.
[02:36:45.849 --> 02:36:46.750]  I think so, too.
[02:36:46.910 --> 02:36:51.312]  The original New Hampshire Constitution was settled by the Scottish people.
[02:36:51.372 --> 02:36:52.433]  Yeah, that's what it is.
[02:36:52.853 --> 02:36:54.274]  And so they have the fighting blood in them.
[02:36:54.907 --> 02:36:56.728]  Boy, do they, if you look at history, it really is.
[02:36:57.348 --> 02:36:58.848]  Different breeds of people are different.
[02:36:59.329 --> 02:37:01.229]  I mean, that's just a fact, folks.
[02:37:01.769 --> 02:37:05.731]  And yeah, the Scots, I was here fighting Irish, but my goodness, look at this.
[02:37:05.891 --> 02:37:07.151]  Andrew Jackson was a Scot.
[02:37:07.812 --> 02:37:11.033]  Of course, he was Scotch-Irish, but a whole other issue.
[02:37:11.753 --> 02:37:13.313]  I'm just tired of it.
[02:37:13.574 --> 02:37:14.414]  I mean, it's like Africa.
[02:37:14.454 --> 02:37:17.415]  The Zulus were known for being warriors and were bigger.
[02:37:18.636 --> 02:37:19.417]  You know, all of that.
[02:37:19.457 --> 02:37:20.597]  I mean, it's the same.
[02:37:20.617 --> 02:37:22.699]  Certain peoples, I guess, just have a heritage of fighting.
[02:37:23.079 --> 02:37:24.580]  I'm not trying to bash my own state, folks.
[02:37:24.600 --> 02:37:25.740]  I'm not trying to bash New York.
[02:37:25.780 --> 02:37:27.201]  I'm not trying to bash Illinois.
[02:37:27.481 --> 02:37:28.442]  They're full of great people.
[02:37:28.462 --> 02:37:29.622]  I mean, I'm bashing my own state.
[02:37:29.643 --> 02:37:30.103]  Understand.
[02:37:30.343 --> 02:37:31.343]  We need to be bashed.
[02:37:31.384 --> 02:37:32.804]  We need to be ashamed of ourselves.
[02:37:33.185 --> 02:37:34.265]  I'm ashamed of myself.
[02:37:34.565 --> 02:37:35.726]  I'm ashamed of what's happened.
[02:37:36.126 --> 02:37:42.610]  People think they're free in Texas and places like Alabama and West Virginia and Arizona.
[02:37:42.670 --> 02:37:46.032]  And I'm here to tell you, we're not as free as Vermont or New Hampshire.
[02:37:48.286 --> 02:37:49.887]  So now I'm worshipping your state, Sue.
[02:37:50.648 --> 02:37:53.170]  Let's go ahead and talk to Eric.
[02:37:53.870 --> 02:37:54.911]  Eric in California.
[02:37:54.951 --> 02:37:56.713]  Boy, you've got a shameful state, don't you?
[02:37:56.873 --> 02:37:57.333]  Yeah, I do.
[02:37:57.413 --> 02:37:58.474]  I just want to say one thing.
[02:37:58.534 --> 02:37:59.595]  Live free or die.
[02:37:59.615 --> 02:38:00.896]  That is the motto of New Hampshire.
[02:38:00.936 --> 02:38:02.337]  I wish it was for California.
[02:38:02.357 --> 02:38:03.278]  We were a republic.
[02:38:03.318 --> 02:38:04.799]  Now we're a bunch of liberal wussies.
[02:38:04.839 --> 02:38:07.861]  And I'm tired of having my right taken away to defend myself.
[02:38:08.242 --> 02:38:13.866]  Because in the state of California, basically, you cannot have an exposed firearm without a permit.
[02:38:13.926 --> 02:38:15.447]  And it takes an act of God to permit.
[02:38:15.507 --> 02:38:16.148]  So basically...
[02:38:17.216 --> 02:38:18.276]  I can't defend myself.
[02:38:18.336 --> 02:38:19.977]  A lot of people say, oh, just call the police.
[02:38:20.017 --> 02:38:20.637]  Call the police.
[02:38:20.997 --> 02:38:22.277]  Honestly, I love the police.
[02:38:22.357 --> 02:38:23.198]  I live in Chula Vista.
[02:38:23.258 --> 02:38:24.658]  Our police officers are very wonderful.
[02:38:24.678 --> 02:38:25.678]  They love our Constitution.
[02:38:25.918 --> 02:38:29.919]  But we only have 200 of them compared to the hundreds of thousands of people we have in this city.
[02:38:30.399 --> 02:38:31.780]  And it's getting pointless.
[02:38:31.800 --> 02:38:34.080]  The criminals have the guns and the good people can't do anything about it.
[02:38:34.140 --> 02:38:34.660]  I'm tired of it.
[02:38:35.461 --> 02:38:36.241]  I want my freedom!
[02:38:36.721 --> 02:38:37.421]  Well, exactly.
[02:38:37.461 --> 02:38:44.643]  It's time for good Californians, good people in Illinois, good people in Minnesota, good Texans to stop letting the...
[02:38:46.162 --> 02:38:48.543]  Oh, what's that neocon talk show host call him?
[02:38:48.563 --> 02:38:49.084]  And he's right.
[02:38:49.104 --> 02:38:53.546]  You know, the nail-biting, bed-wetting liberals.
[02:38:54.226 --> 02:38:54.567]  It's amazing.
[02:38:54.607 --> 02:38:55.707]  A lot of people have this idea.
[02:38:55.727 --> 02:39:00.710]  A lot of game members are like, oh, yeah, we should reduce guns.
[02:39:00.730 --> 02:39:01.490]  That's what stops violence.
[02:39:01.550 --> 02:39:05.552]  And all these liberals are saying, like Christian Hillcrest in San Diego, like, oh, get rid of guns.
[02:39:05.632 --> 02:39:07.033]  If we get rid of guns and stuff like that.
[02:39:07.489 --> 02:39:08.449]  Oh, it'll be much safer.
[02:39:08.509 --> 02:39:09.210]  It's not true.
[02:39:09.270 --> 02:39:15.691]  I've been... You know the people I've met here in the state of California that shoot at the bonafide shooting ranges we have here are all decent Americans.
[02:39:15.711 --> 02:39:16.632]  None of them are psycho.
[02:39:17.812 --> 02:39:24.314]  I told one guy a while back, you know, while I was going to go buy one, that in the back a long time ago I had antidepressant.
[02:39:24.354 --> 02:39:30.916]  And he's so serious, he's so serious and actually, what do you call it, not selling firearms to people, that he refused me.
[02:39:31.036 --> 02:39:31.816]  Although I'm not under...
[02:39:32.276 --> 02:39:32.916]  Well, I understand.
[02:39:32.936 --> 02:39:34.057]  That's all the weird regulations.
[02:39:34.097 --> 02:39:34.897]  Listen, thanks for the call.
[02:39:34.917 --> 02:39:35.777]  I appreciate it.
[02:39:36.057 --> 02:39:38.678]  I've got to move on, but let me just say this about this subject.
[02:39:38.898 --> 02:39:40.878]  They're shutting the shooting ranges down in California.
[02:39:40.898 --> 02:39:43.819]  They've banned ammo, what, above .40 caliber in L.A.?
[02:39:44.379 --> 02:39:46.420]  A bunch of cities have banned selling ammo.
[02:39:46.440 --> 02:39:49.361]  They've banned guns, period, in San Francisco.
[02:39:50.121 --> 02:39:55.824]  And these idiots don't understand that the first gun control in America, they always start with a minority.
[02:39:56.124 --> 02:39:59.606]  Oh, we're just taking the rights of the Muslims, or the Arabs, or people that are brown.
[02:40:00.046 --> 02:40:04.509]  Well, back then it was, oh, we're just going to have gun laws against blacks.
[02:40:05.249 --> 02:40:07.031]  I think that's disgusting.
[02:40:24.131 --> 02:40:25.691]  Yes, John, you want to comment on that?
[02:40:26.672 --> 02:40:31.193]  Yeah, what happens is, you know, they go after minorities that are unable to defend themselves.
[02:40:31.773 --> 02:40:35.554]  In New Hampshire, everybody's equal and we have the means to defend ourselves.
[02:40:35.774 --> 02:40:39.814]  And nobody's taking away, in fact, they're enforcing better protections.
[02:40:39.854 --> 02:40:45.096]  By the way, New Hampshire, this is national statistics, and Vermont have the lowest crime rate of the country.
[02:40:45.596 --> 02:40:46.876]  And there's just guns everywhere.
[02:40:48.081 --> 02:40:51.123]  And we also have the lowest police per population ratio.
[02:40:51.243 --> 02:40:59.667]  There's guns everywhere, people doing whatever they want, no problem, just nice, friendly people and the criminals, literally like vampires running at high noon away from your state.
[02:41:00.387 --> 02:41:03.809]  They're all running down here and even worse to other areas.
[02:41:04.149 --> 02:41:05.870]  Well, Massachusetts, they're having a field day.
[02:41:06.310 --> 02:41:07.750]  Oh, man, I know.
[02:41:08.051 --> 02:41:08.791]  I'm sick of it!
[02:41:09.645 --> 02:41:17.927]  I mean, look, to me, my guns are like... I've got a tool chest in the garage with screwdrivers and hammers, and then I've got a gun safe with this same thing.
[02:41:17.967 --> 02:41:18.908]  I mean, it's a tool.
[02:41:18.928 --> 02:41:22.208]  I mean, I've got a whole block of butcher knives.
[02:41:22.228 --> 02:41:23.969]  That doesn't mean I'm not killing people with butcher knives.
[02:41:24.209 --> 02:41:25.949]  And, you know, I always joke about them banning knives.
[02:41:25.969 --> 02:41:28.470]  You know, England's about to regulate and not let you have butcher knives?
[02:41:29.310 --> 02:41:29.750]  Oh, yeah.
[02:41:29.931 --> 02:41:34.952]  In fact, I think they did that stuff in China thousands of years ago.
[02:41:34.972 --> 02:41:38.093]  Only certain chefs could have them, and they would make sure.
[02:41:38.113 --> 02:41:38.593]  That's why they...
[02:41:39.488 --> 02:41:40.449]  We're good to go.
[02:41:40.489 --> 02:41:41.570]  We're good to go.
[02:41:41.690 --> 02:41:42.190]  We're good to go.
[02:42:05.630 --> 02:42:09.613]  And there have been far more white slaves, folks, than there have been black slaves in history.
[02:42:09.633 --> 02:42:11.494]  For people to know that, nobody seems to know that.
[02:42:11.514 --> 02:42:13.716]  There's all this shame black people have because they were slaves.
[02:42:13.756 --> 02:42:15.957]  Well, welcome to the club, folks.
[02:42:16.137 --> 02:42:17.498]  This is the way the world's been operating.
[02:42:17.698 --> 02:42:18.219]  It's wrong.
[02:42:18.639 --> 02:42:21.081]  But it's in the Roman histories.
[02:42:21.141 --> 02:42:23.602]  They could not even have the equivalent of a butter knife.
[02:42:25.984 --> 02:42:26.384]  Oh, man.
[02:42:27.225 --> 02:42:27.745]  It's incredible.
[02:42:27.765 --> 02:42:29.566]  Let's talk to Ron in Texas.
[02:42:29.606 --> 02:42:30.147]  Go ahead, Ron.
[02:42:31.181 --> 02:42:36.165]  Yeah, that sort of reminds me of the way they banned bayonet lugs because of all those drive-by bayonettings.
[02:42:36.945 --> 02:42:46.513]  But I think that the folks that were on TV in New Orleans pretty much deserved what they got because they were not prepared to defend themselves.
[02:42:48.754 --> 02:42:49.595]  Well, I know this.
[02:42:50.335 --> 02:42:56.920]  I mean, I don't know what I'd do if I was high and dry in my house and it was there with my family, and then here come a bunch of troops wanting my guns.
[02:42:57.501 --> 02:42:58.241]  I mean, I just...
[02:42:59.548 --> 02:43:00.768]  I mean, it's unbelievable.
[02:43:00.788 --> 02:43:01.709]  I don't know what I'd do.
[02:43:02.969 --> 02:43:03.829]  Well, I know this much.
[02:43:03.869 --> 02:43:05.870]  They'd have a tough time doing that at my home.
[02:43:05.950 --> 02:43:12.392]  My family is very, very well-versed in how to use what they've got, and it would have been one hell of a firefight.
[02:43:12.712 --> 02:43:13.352]  Well, I know this.
[02:43:13.512 --> 02:43:18.794]  If just a few families stand up, they will quit real fast, because we outnumber them thousands to one.
[02:43:20.614 --> 02:43:21.254]  That's for sure.
[02:43:21.875 --> 02:43:26.356]  And if they start using military aircraft against us, then...
[02:43:31.274 --> 02:43:34.595]  I wonder what I would do about that.
[02:43:35.696 --> 02:43:40.738]  Well, I'm not going to shoot my mouth off about what I'd do, but I'd do what George Washington did.
[02:43:42.802 --> 02:43:44.944]  That's why I've got FEMA on video saying he's a terrorist.
[02:43:44.964 --> 02:43:49.727]  Hey, John, did you know I've got video of FEMA teaching police that our founding fathers are bad?
[02:43:49.747 --> 02:43:51.227]  Geez, that's unbelievable.
[02:43:51.267 --> 02:43:52.048]  No, I'm not kidding.
[02:43:52.408 --> 02:43:55.450]  And then we've got cops all over the nation call in and even send me manuals.
[02:43:55.690 --> 02:43:56.951]  It's the same training regiment.
[02:43:58.272 --> 02:43:59.032]  Man, oh man.
[02:44:00.313 --> 02:44:00.633]  I know.
[02:44:00.653 --> 02:44:07.257]  I mean, if I was one of those cops and that guy got up and started saying George Washington's a terrorist, I'd say, you're the terrorist, now get out of here!
[02:44:08.203 --> 02:44:09.924]  How do they talk about those men like that?
[02:44:09.964 --> 02:44:12.986]  I just cannot... I mean, how obvious does it have to get?
[02:44:13.066 --> 02:44:15.027]  It's like comic book ridiculous.
[02:44:15.787 --> 02:44:19.669]  You know, I'm glad up here in New Hampshire we elect our police chief.
[02:44:20.050 --> 02:44:22.091]  He has to run for election every three years.
[02:44:22.471 --> 02:44:23.171]  Well, it's the same thing.
[02:44:23.671 --> 02:44:26.313]  Now the cities are trying to usurp the sheriffs, and that's...
[02:44:27.190 --> 02:44:28.031]  Well, that's backwards.
[02:44:28.051 --> 02:44:29.452]  They have another word they add to that.
[02:44:29.713 --> 02:44:31.534]  Listen, I want to thank you, John, for joining us.
[02:44:31.554 --> 02:44:40.623]  Give us that website for the Libertarian Party in New Hampshire so we can lavish you with support and praise and visits and collaboration.
[02:44:41.224 --> 02:44:43.726]  Well, the Libertarian Party is lpnh.org.
[02:44:47.350 --> 02:44:53.032]  And if you want to see what the activists are doing in New Hampshire, it's nhfree.com.
[02:44:53.412 --> 02:44:53.772]  All right.
[02:44:54.132 --> 02:44:55.052]  I want to thank you for joining us.
[02:44:55.092 --> 02:44:56.153]  Thanks for the call, Ron, too.
[02:44:56.713 --> 02:44:58.553]  John, stay in touch with us in the future.
[02:44:58.853 --> 02:44:59.273]  Sure will.
[02:44:59.554 --> 02:45:00.034]  We'll see you.
[02:45:00.514 --> 02:45:01.894]  I'm out of time, basically, here.
[02:45:01.914 --> 02:45:04.655]  I want to get into Sharon briefly, but I said I had this four-minute clip.
[02:45:05.282 --> 02:45:08.484]  And this is these trendy Wendy's, as Paul Watson calls them.
[02:45:08.664 --> 02:45:10.205]  These little punks who write books.
[02:45:10.225 --> 02:45:11.466]  The media gives them all this attention.
[02:45:11.967 --> 02:45:12.927]  Oh, I've got a chip.
[02:45:13.047 --> 02:45:14.648]  Oh, you're so trendy.
[02:45:14.969 --> 02:45:15.409]  And here it is.
[02:45:15.429 --> 02:45:17.831]  Computer chips can under skin of enthusiast Reuters.
[02:45:18.351 --> 02:45:21.493]  Forgetting computer passwords is an everyday source of frustration.
[02:45:22.334 --> 02:45:24.335]  But a solution may literally be at hand.
[02:45:24.355 --> 02:45:26.596]  And in the form of computer chip implants.
[02:45:28.017 --> 02:45:30.059]  With a wave of his hand, Amal Grasfostra...
[02:45:33.325 --> 02:45:37.967]  A 29-year-old entrepreneur based in Vancouver, Canada, opens his front door with another.
[02:45:38.347 --> 02:45:43.891]  He logs onto his computer, and it's the coolest thing, and it's totally stylish.
[02:45:44.271 --> 02:45:55.757]  And actually, computer scientists and security experts have said, for like $5, these guys can make a reader with existing parts that reads what your code is, then opens your door.
[02:45:56.018 --> 02:45:58.219]  This stuff actually makes everything worse, but see...
[02:45:59.005 --> 02:45:59.968]  These guys are guaranteed.
[02:46:00.449 --> 02:46:01.171]  I bet money.
[02:46:01.271 --> 02:46:04.017]  Well, I'm going to interview them, and we'll ferret it out.
[02:46:04.622 --> 02:46:09.366]  I wonder what grants they're getting from certain companies, universities, intelligence agencies.
[02:46:09.906 --> 02:46:14.370]  But we read the Pentagon documents public back in 2000, six years ago now.
[02:46:15.031 --> 02:46:17.152]  It was January of 2000, January of 6000.
[02:46:17.773 --> 02:46:29.122]  Actually, today is when they released that report, six years ago, and said that they were going to use PR and trendiness to get everybody to take chips.
[02:46:29.162 --> 02:46:30.724]  So here are some of these little...
[02:46:32.168 --> 02:46:36.351]  Totally uncool people just getting off on how different they are.
[02:46:36.371 --> 02:46:38.312]  Go ahead and roll these little people.
[02:46:39.213 --> 02:46:41.214]  Digitized from New York, this is Johnny Goldstein.
[02:46:41.274 --> 02:46:47.698]  I'm speaking with my friend, Mikey Sklar, who recently had an RFID chip implanted into his hand.
[02:46:47.738 --> 02:46:48.999]  Hey, Mikey.
[02:46:49.039 --> 02:46:50.600]  How's it going?
[02:46:50.960 --> 02:46:51.801]  Good.
[02:46:51.881 --> 02:46:52.641]  Good?
[02:46:53.122 --> 02:46:56.244]  So, can you show us your hand where you had the chip implanted?
[02:46:56.764 --> 02:46:57.024]  Sure.
[02:46:57.345 --> 02:47:00.167]  I had the chip implanted between my thumb and forefinger.
[02:47:00.688 --> 02:47:02.089]  This was the incision point.
[02:47:02.650 --> 02:47:08.235]  So where the injector gun that I had purchased from the UK was used to implant the chip.
[02:47:08.755 --> 02:47:10.437]  And so where is the chip about now?
[02:47:10.457 --> 02:47:12.358]  Can you point to where it actually is?
[02:47:12.759 --> 02:47:19.085]  It is between... It's about in this area here, just below the incision mark.
[02:47:20.303 --> 02:47:29.406]  And so, can you describe, well, people would be curious, like, why did this occur to you?
[02:47:29.446 --> 02:47:35.128]  What is an RFID chip and why did this even occur to you to have it injected into your hand?
[02:47:35.148 --> 02:47:41.250]  Okay, well, an RFID tag is a radio frequency identification tag.
[02:47:41.991 --> 02:47:47.713]  It is not so commonly used in people today, but I have seen a small growing population of
[02:47:48.653 --> 02:47:51.995]  Of course, it's just horrible audio, a big party with all these just...
[02:48:16.388 --> 02:48:25.313]  I mean, you look at them, these vacant-eyed, little simpering, human... I'm not going to say it.
[02:48:25.333 --> 02:48:28.514]  I mean, you've got to hate people like that.
[02:48:29.115 --> 02:48:33.837]  Just vacuous, mindless little twits.
[02:48:35.238 --> 02:48:36.158]  I'm a slave.
[02:48:36.338 --> 02:48:37.739]  I'm so cool.
[02:48:37.819 --> 02:48:39.320]  You're not.
[02:48:39.340 --> 02:48:40.741]  And that's what they go on to say.
[02:48:41.321 --> 02:48:43.802]  I'm so cool.
[02:48:44.062 --> 02:48:45.443]  These kids are going to suck it up.
[02:48:46.849 --> 02:48:49.691]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[02:48:49.951 --> 02:48:50.652]  Hello, my friends.
[02:48:50.752 --> 02:48:51.532]  Alex Jones here.
[02:48:51.872 --> 02:48:56.535]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[02:48:56.896 --> 02:49:03.620]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[02:49:03.960 --> 02:49:05.920]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[02:49:06.141 --> 02:49:08.981]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[02:49:09.061 --> 02:49:13.742]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[02:49:13.922 --> 02:49:18.343]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.

[02:49:46.616 --> 02:49:49.600]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[02:49:49.961 --> 02:49:58.772]  It's portable and requires no water pressure, so you can enjoy healthy drinking water, whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[02:49:59.113 --> 02:50:03.779]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[02:50:04.239 --> 02:50:10.963]  The Berkey Light is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[02:50:11.364 --> 02:50:23.131]  It also removes foul taste and odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:50:23.611 --> 02:50:28.074]  The Berkey Light's rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.

[02:51:51.149 --> 02:51:53.793]  This is for all the folks up in New Hampshire, up in Vermont.
[02:51:53.813 --> 02:51:54.193]  Here it is.
[02:51:54.213 --> 02:51:54.694]  It's for you.
[02:51:54.714 --> 02:51:57.878]  They laid their bodies down.
[02:52:07.242 --> 02:52:10.104]  The bloody war.
[02:52:11.245 --> 02:52:12.927]  For liberty.
[02:52:14.288 --> 02:52:15.889]  For their descendants.
[02:52:16.029 --> 02:52:16.870]  That's you.
[02:52:17.730 --> 02:52:19.672]  That's me.
[02:52:21.954 --> 02:52:30.600]  And all over the country, sharp-dressed, former military commandos, are wearing $2,000 suits.
[02:52:33.724 --> 02:52:37.265]  And they're teaching police that George Washington is bad.
[02:52:38.845 --> 02:52:40.086]  They're tying.
[02:52:41.306 --> 02:52:47.028]  Thank God for the renegades.
[02:52:48.488 --> 02:52:52.129]  When it comes to heroes, renegades are mine.
[02:52:52.409 --> 02:52:53.910]  I love George Washington.
[02:52:54.010 --> 02:52:55.550]  I love Thomas Jefferson.
[02:52:55.870 --> 02:52:57.471]  I love Andrew Jackson.
[02:52:57.551 --> 02:52:58.831]  I know what they did.
[02:52:59.071 --> 02:53:00.491]  These were incredible people.
[02:53:00.511 --> 02:53:02.132]  It had never been done before.
[02:53:05.452 --> 02:53:11.316]  We're fighting a bunch of trash, and they're a bunch of cowardly filth at that, and I'm not afraid of them, and you shouldn't be either.
[02:53:11.856 --> 02:53:13.638]  Stop being afraid of what people think about you.
[02:53:14.118 --> 02:53:25.045]  Mark Twain said it in the beginning, a patriot is a scarce man, hated and feared, but in time when his cause succeeds, the timid join him, because then it costs nothing to be a patriot.
[02:53:25.951 --> 02:53:35.816]  Get up at your church and say the government carried out 9-11 attacks and then have one of the 20-page deals on the web that goes through all the smoking guns and pick which one you think is the best.
[02:53:35.876 --> 02:53:39.398]  And you're saying, I happen to have 500 copies of it here for everybody.
[02:53:39.758 --> 02:53:43.580]  And if you want to know more, I've got a trunk full of martial law DVDs.
[02:53:46.388 --> 02:53:49.109]  And if that church doesn't want you there, then leave it.
[02:53:49.189 --> 02:53:53.371]  But you're going to find out you're going to be a real popular guy if you do that after a few months.
[02:53:54.212 --> 02:53:55.713]  That's the sick thing about this.
[02:53:57.053 --> 02:53:59.374]  You get punished when you go along with bullies.
[02:53:59.414 --> 02:54:02.016]  You get in trouble when you lick boots.
[02:54:03.296 --> 02:54:06.938]  And some of us have got to hit the barbed wire first, but I've been honored to always do it.
[02:54:06.958 --> 02:54:08.999]  And there have been consequences, but I just don't care.
[02:54:10.059 --> 02:54:10.700]  You know, it's what...
[02:54:14.163 --> 02:54:16.144]  What did the head of British Naval Forces say?
[02:54:16.164 --> 02:54:18.786]  He said, damn the maneuver, just go straight at them.
[02:54:19.446 --> 02:54:23.029]  I'm having a vacant moment myself in my brain.
[02:54:26.010 --> 02:54:28.832]  The point is, it's just better to get it on.
[02:54:29.373 --> 02:54:29.913]  You know what?
[02:54:30.493 --> 02:54:31.974]  I'm just not putting up with it anymore.
[02:54:32.014 --> 02:54:36.257]  I've just decided, bullies period, anywhere in my life, anybody,
[02:54:36.989 --> 02:54:38.531]  And it's not that I've got a chip on my shoulder.
[02:54:38.571 --> 02:54:39.372]  I feel good.
[02:54:39.732 --> 02:54:40.453]  I'm alive.
[02:54:40.553 --> 02:54:43.275]  I mean, I'm kind of walking the steps of my ancestors.
[02:54:43.896 --> 02:54:46.679]  And that's the best feeling there is when you've got great ancestors.
[02:54:47.099 --> 02:54:49.141]  You know, as Americans, we've got great ancestors.
[02:54:49.161 --> 02:54:50.403]  I don't care what color you are.
[02:54:51.324 --> 02:54:53.966]  We've got great ancestors, and we ought to be proud of them.
[02:54:55.187 --> 02:54:56.609]  We ought to be proud of who we are.
[02:54:57.466 --> 02:55:03.472]  We ought to be proud of our history, that we've been a swashbuckling, reckless, dangerous, shoot-em-up nation.
[02:55:03.492 --> 02:55:08.737]  We ought to be proud of the fact that we've been a bunch of roughnecks, that we've been a bunch of people that went through adversity.
[02:55:09.157 --> 02:55:15.303]  I'm glad that we don't come from the stock all over the world of people that just sat there sucking their thumbs!
[02:55:17.620 --> 02:55:19.421]  So I salute all of you out there.
[02:55:19.461 --> 02:55:22.263]  I salute the good cops that have bucked the corrupt system.
[02:55:22.704 --> 02:55:25.466]  I salute the good school teachers that have bucked the corrupt system.
[02:55:25.786 --> 02:55:33.131]  I salute everybody who stood up against lies, stood up against bullies, stood up against status quo, stood up against all of it.
[02:55:33.231 --> 02:55:35.893]  Because if it wasn't for you, we wouldn't have anything.
[02:55:35.913 --> 02:55:46.080]  You know, I don't spend my native, raw, animalistic war energies that God gave us for a reason...
[02:55:47.279 --> 02:55:49.823]  On some facsimile, like sports.
[02:55:50.464 --> 02:55:51.666]  Some spectating event.
[02:55:52.547 --> 02:55:54.811]  I use it, I sharpen it, I hone it.
[02:55:55.632 --> 02:56:06.214]  I use it as energy to drive my intellect and my everyday energies for the love of my family and love of the country they come from and love of the ancestors and love of my progeny to come.
[02:56:06.354 --> 02:56:07.214]  It is holy.
[02:56:07.794 --> 02:56:09.614]  It is what life is all about.
[02:56:09.975 --> 02:56:11.475]  It is what will fulfill you.
[02:56:11.855 --> 02:56:19.436]  It is what God wants you to live in and to have a piece of and the world wants to steal it from you so that you'll never truly develop.
[02:56:19.956 --> 02:56:21.136]  Break your chains!
[02:56:21.496 --> 02:56:23.097]  Smash for the new world order!
[02:56:25.862 --> 02:56:26.183]  Or call 877-300-7645
