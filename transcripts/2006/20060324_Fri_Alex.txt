[00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:06.350]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.011 --> 00:00:08.072]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.792 --> 00:00:09.913]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.554 --> 00:00:11.355]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.115 --> 00:00:13.016]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.036 --> 00:00:17.360]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.964]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:33.783 --> 00:00:48.507]  Welcome, my friends, to this live Friday edition right here on the GCN Radio Network as we blast out on the AM and FM dial, global shortwave satellite, and the Internet at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com as well as PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:00:48.547 --> 00:00:49.148]  It is the 24th day.
[00:00:51.212 --> 00:00:52.153]  I think we're good to go.
[00:01:16.801 --> 00:01:17.221]  February 27, 1933.
[00:01:18.642 --> 00:01:20.762]  It was a self-inflicted wound.
[00:01:21.102 --> 00:01:22.743]  It was an inside job.
[00:01:22.783 --> 00:01:24.003]  And we have declassified U.S.
[00:01:24.783 --> 00:01:26.343]  government documents that show it.
[00:01:27.024 --> 00:01:39.367]  And history was again made last night when CNN allowed me to go on live, unedited, and with no restrictions, to expose government involvement in September 11th.
[00:01:39.387 --> 00:01:40.887]  It was absolutely amazing.
[00:01:41.447 --> 00:01:44.188]  And an audio clip of that is coming up later.
[00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.881]  In this hour.
[00:01:46.361 --> 00:01:48.362]  Charlie Sheen will again be joining us.
[00:01:48.402 --> 00:01:49.103]  He's scheduled.
[00:01:49.123 --> 00:01:50.804]  Now, they shoot the TV show.
[00:01:50.844 --> 00:01:56.407]  They pre-shoot and rehearse all week, Monday through Thursday, and 12-hour days.
[00:01:56.487 --> 00:02:00.369]  And then they have 14-plus-hour days every Friday when they shoot the show.
[00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:02.591]  So he wants to come on.
[00:02:02.631 --> 00:02:03.712]  He says he's coming on.
[00:02:04.712 --> 00:02:07.674]  And we are really looking forward to having him on.
[00:02:07.994 --> 00:02:14.258]  And so I'd say 98% chance he will be joining us last 30 minutes of the show today just to respond to the international news.
[00:02:15.442 --> 00:02:19.497]  And have some more statements about September 11th as well.
[00:02:20.525 --> 00:02:21.966]  We're good to go.
[00:02:21.986 --> 00:02:22.126]  I think?
[00:02:49.784 --> 00:02:52.050]  We have a giant new controversy.
[00:02:52.691 --> 00:02:53.473]  It's ongoing.
[00:02:54.857 --> 00:02:55.579]  We pointed out, of
[00:03:00.078 --> 00:03:07.182]  World's port deal out of the UAE-based company coming to take over 21 major U.S.
[00:03:07.222 --> 00:03:07.542]  ports.
[00:03:07.582 --> 00:03:16.747]  In fact, over half of the deepwater major ports in the country from the British-owned company, which was Oriental Steam Navigation.
[00:03:17.428 --> 00:03:19.549]  And Bush said he didn't care what the people wanted.
[00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:21.530]  He was going to do it, but he had to back down.
[00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:26.893]  Well, now they're just having Halliburton take that over for the UAE port.
[00:03:27.785 --> 00:03:31.028]  ...based company, Dubai Ports World, and so we'll be getting into that.
[00:03:31.248 --> 00:03:44.017]  But to add insult to injury, we documented how Clinton and our own government had handed over the Panama Canal and major ports like Long Beach Naval Base to the Communist Chinese-run company Hutchinson Wampo.
[00:03:44.518 --> 00:03:53.304]  And out of the Associated Press today, ladies and gentlemen, out of the Associated Press, we have an outrage of outrages.
[00:03:53.945 --> 00:03:54.265]  U.S.
[00:03:54.805 --> 00:03:56.807]  hiring Hong Kong company, and it's not...
[00:03:57.527 --> 00:03:59.328]  Chinese government run, that's admitted.
[00:03:59.808 --> 00:04:07.190]  To scan cargo, the Bush administration says it is finalizing a no-bid contract with Hutchison Wampo LTD.
[00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:16.954]  It acknowledged the deal was the first time a foreign company will be involved in running a radiation detector in an overseas port without American custom agents present.
[00:04:17.014 --> 00:04:21.295]  Now, there's three things in that one paragraph that are bombshell.
[00:04:21.455 --> 00:04:23.916]  Each and every one of them is so important.
[00:04:24.668 --> 00:04:31.310]  And so treasonous and so treacherous that we will detail when we get back from this quick break.
[00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:33.811]  So you're going to want to stay with us as we get into this.
[00:04:33.911 --> 00:04:36.692]  Because remember, I talk specifically about Freeport and the Bahamas.
[00:04:37.012 --> 00:04:41.314]  Specifically this giant communist military base.
[00:04:41.674 --> 00:04:44.435]  It is a military base that they have moved in.
[00:04:44.735 --> 00:04:49.497]  They have moved in with their industry, with their military-controlled ships.
[00:04:50.237 --> 00:04:52.818]  And it is a total nightmare.
[00:04:53.658 --> 00:04:58.743]  This is the key port in the Caribbean, and it's just being done in our face.
[00:04:59.463 --> 00:05:00.725]  We'll be right back.
[00:05:02.686 --> 00:05:05.549]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[00:05:05.809 --> 00:05:06.510]  Hello, my friends.
[00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:07.391]  Alex Jones here.
[00:05:07.731 --> 00:05:12.395]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law, 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[00:05:12.756 --> 00:05:19.482]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[00:05:19.802 --> 00:05:21.763]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[00:05:21.984 --> 00:05:24.846]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[00:05:24.926 --> 00:05:29.589]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[00:05:29.789 --> 00:05:34.172]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight, piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[00:05:34.432 --> 00:05:41.657]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[00:05:41.917 --> 00:05:44.319]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.
[00:05:44.499 --> 00:05:46.220]  Call toll-free to get a copy of Martial Law.

[00:06:02.469 --> 00:06:05.473]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[00:06:05.813 --> 00:06:14.624]  It's portable and requires no water pressure, so you can enjoy healthy drinking water, whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[00:06:14.964 --> 00:06:19.650]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:26.812]  The Berkey Lot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[00:06:27.212 --> 00:06:38.995]  It also removes foul taste and odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:06:39.475 --> 00:06:43.939]  The Berkey Light's rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.

[00:07:08.696 --> 00:07:13.697]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using the Rife frequency technology.
[00:07:14.037 --> 00:07:21.939]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:07:22.099 --> 00:07:29.141]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:07:29.361 --> 00:07:30.563]  There are no side effects.
[00:07:30.723 --> 00:07:34.107]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[00:07:34.168 --> 00:07:35.289]  Don't just treat symptoms.

[00:07:50.707 --> 00:07:54.089]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:07:54.109 --> 00:07:56.630]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:19.261 --> 00:08:20.541]  We're good to go.
[00:08:41.579 --> 00:08:49.128]  But last night, they did have me on, on the showbiz today, for six minutes, unedited, live.
[00:08:49.148 --> 00:08:51.972]  They just let me go on, and I'll be back on there tonight.
[00:08:52.452 --> 00:08:54.715]  Yes, back on, coming up this evening.
[00:08:55.196 --> 00:09:01.163]  And we do have Charlie Sheen scheduled in the last 30 minutes of the broadcast today, joining us live.
[00:09:01.846 --> 00:09:03.166]  From Southern California.
[00:09:03.286 --> 00:09:11.049]  So for some updates and some news that will certainly send more shockwaves across the country.
[00:09:11.529 --> 00:09:16.551]  So we're going to go ahead and play the CNN clip right now.
[00:09:17.051 --> 00:09:22.092]  And they first introduced it, and then they cut to me, and I hit them as hard as I can in the time that I had.
[00:09:22.172 --> 00:09:26.814]  So here it is from last night, and this is CNN Showbiz Tonight.
[00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:36.825]  On Showbiz Tonight, Charlie Sheen speaks out on a controversial theory that the government covered up what really happened on 9-11.
[00:09:37.165 --> 00:09:43.669]  Taking over four commercial airliners and hitting 75% of their targets, that feels like a conspiracy theory.
[00:09:43.889 --> 00:09:45.690]  Tonight, we dig even deeper.
[00:09:45.910 --> 00:09:52.194]  The host of the radio show on which Sheen leveled his startling allegations joins us live right here on Showbiz Tonight.
[00:09:52.535 --> 00:09:55.236]  Plus, the overwhelming response from you, the viewers.
[00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:08.140]  Hello, I'm A.J.
[00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:09.401]  Hammer, live in New York City.
[00:10:09.921 --> 00:10:11.761]  And I'm Brooke Anderson, live in Hollywood.
[00:10:11.821 --> 00:10:13.142]  A.J., it's been incredible.
[00:10:13.162 --> 00:10:24.865]  Pretty hard to believe, actually, the response we got today to the incredible story show that tonight broke last night after Charlie Sheen's startling claims that the government may be covering up what really happened on September 11th.
[00:10:25.425 --> 00:10:26.526]  So many emails coming in.
[00:10:26.566 --> 00:10:28.008]  We've been really overwhelmed today.
[00:10:28.048 --> 00:10:32.132]  Between the emails, the blogs, the websites, everybody is writing and talking about it.
[00:10:32.452 --> 00:10:36.376]  Charlie Sheen made the comments during a hard-to-believe interview on a radio show.
[00:10:36.456 --> 00:10:43.063]  And don't move, because in just a moment, the host of the radio show, the guy who actually spoke with Sheen, is going to join me live here on Showbiz Tonight.
[00:10:43.083 --> 00:10:46.106]  But first, let's get you up to speed on the latest developments.
[00:10:48.403 --> 00:10:59.973]  The more you look at stuff, especially specific incidents, specific events around the faithful day, it just raises a lot of questions.
[00:11:00.414 --> 00:11:05.318]  The questions Charlie Sheen is raising about the 9-11 attacks are raising a lot of eyebrows.
[00:11:05.798 --> 00:11:11.964]  Our email inbox immediately started to overflow, and the coverage on Showbiz Tonight is getting a lot of attention.
[00:11:12.284 --> 00:11:21.472]  The website 9-11 Blogger calls Showbiz Tonight's coverage, quote, the first time a major news station has covered 9-11 questions in any reasonable format.
[00:11:21.813 --> 00:11:29.780]  It all started with a radio interview Sheen gave to GCN Radio Network host Alex Jones, a cult hero of sorts to 9-11 conspiracy theorists.
[00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:33.823]  Well, during the interview, Sheen made clear that he backs Jones' views.
[00:11:34.283 --> 00:11:37.626]  We're not the conspiracy theorists on this particular issue.
[00:11:37.846 --> 00:11:47.694]  It seems to me like, you know, 19 amateurs with box cutters taking over four commercial airliners and hitting 75% of their targets.
[00:11:48.594 --> 00:11:50.196]  That feels like a conspiracy theory.
[00:11:50.516 --> 00:11:57.161]  Sheen also made another shocking suggestion that we may not know the full story about the collapse of the World Trade Center.
[00:11:57.581 --> 00:12:11.384]  I have a hard time believing that a fireball traveled down the elevator over 1,100 feet and still had the explosive energy to destroy the lobby like it was described.
[00:12:11.884 --> 00:12:20.225]  I said, hey, call me insane, but did it sort of look like those buildings came down in a controlled demolition?
[00:12:20.605 --> 00:12:23.206]  When I was your age, I could only dream about my parents splitting up.
[00:12:24.046 --> 00:12:29.090]  As the star of the hit sitcom Two and a Half Men, Sheen is seen weekly by about 10 million people.
[00:12:29.571 --> 00:12:34.074]  And many of them may end up paying attention to his controversial comments on 9-11.
[00:12:37.189 --> 00:12:41.752]  As I mentioned, the radio host who interviewed Sheen is Alex Jones of the Genesis Communications Network.
[00:12:42.173 --> 00:12:46.296]  Alex joins me live from Austin, Texas to talk about Sheen's riveting comments.
[00:12:46.716 --> 00:12:50.939]  Alex, as I mentioned, the response that we got from doing this story last night, absolutely shocking.
[00:12:50.959 --> 00:12:52.800]  So I want to know how it actually all came about.
[00:12:53.181 --> 00:12:55.462]  How did the interview with Charlie Sheen actually happen?
[00:12:55.482 --> 00:12:56.603]  Did you guys reach out to him?
[00:12:56.623 --> 00:12:57.264]  Did he call you?
[00:12:57.304 --> 00:12:57.824]  What was the deal?
[00:12:58.576 --> 00:13:04.517]  Well, just to make something clear, Mr. Sheen has amazing courage to do what he's done, and he contacted me.
[00:13:04.557 --> 00:13:06.738]  He's been watching my documentaries for years.
[00:13:06.778 --> 00:13:10.198]  He's one of the most informed people that I've talked to in Hollywood on this subject.
[00:13:10.218 --> 00:13:16.580]  Listen, for years, Hollywood's been on fire with people knowing the truth about 9-11, and I was the first to expose 9-11 on the day.
[00:13:16.620 --> 00:13:21.841]  In fact, two months before, I had intel that elements of the military-inductual complex were going to carry out the attack.
[00:13:21.881 --> 00:13:27.002]  I said they'll use bin Laden, the known CIA asset, as their patsy to take the blame for attacking the towers.
[00:13:27.282 --> 00:13:32.305]  So Mr. Sheen is only exceptional in that he has courage in going public.
[00:13:32.405 --> 00:13:34.287]  Courage that no one else in Hollywood had.
[00:13:34.307 --> 00:13:40.671]  I mean, here's a CNN poll from Anderson Cooper a year and a half ago where they said, is the government covering up 9-11?
[00:13:40.691 --> 00:13:41.571]  Could they be involved?
[00:13:42.752 --> 00:13:45.874]  90% when the poll closed on CNN said this.
[00:13:45.914 --> 00:13:47.876]  So listen, I have my own syndicated show.
[00:13:47.976 --> 00:13:50.617]  I've done 4,000 radio interviews in the last four and a half years.
[00:13:50.998 --> 00:13:52.879]  Almost no one calls in and disagrees now.
[00:13:53.119 --> 00:13:55.581]  We have the majority view and we have the evidence.
[00:13:55.721 --> 00:13:55.801]  And
[00:13:56.381 --> 00:13:58.562]  Bottom line, there are declassified U.S.
[00:13:58.582 --> 00:14:02.123]  government documents like Operation Northwoods that ABC News reported on back in 2000.
[00:14:02.923 --> 00:14:03.863]  Operation Northwoods.
[00:14:03.923 --> 00:14:04.363]  Google it.
[00:14:04.723 --> 00:14:05.704]  And in there, the U.S.
[00:14:05.744 --> 00:14:11.545]  government, an element of it, said we want to hijack jets, fire remote control, crash them, and blame it on the Soviet Union and Cuba.
[00:14:11.766 --> 00:14:13.606]  Now, that was decades ago.
[00:14:13.706 --> 00:14:15.167]  This is why we believe this.
[00:14:15.187 --> 00:14:19.788]  Then you look at the official story, the firefighters, the police, hundreds of them saying there were bombs in the buildings.
[00:14:19.988 --> 00:14:20.988]  They were told to shut up.
[00:14:21.168 --> 00:14:23.189]  You look at Building 7, detonators are going off.
[00:14:23.209 --> 00:14:23.729]  You can see the
[00:14:24.229 --> 00:14:26.711]  And Alex, and Alex, a lot of this is what Charlie Sheen was covering.
[00:14:26.751 --> 00:14:29.292]  I'm actually just curious, did he reach out to you guys?
[00:14:29.352 --> 00:14:30.873]  Is he the one who put the call in to you?
[00:14:30.893 --> 00:14:31.114]  Sure, sure.
[00:14:31.134 --> 00:14:32.294]  And how he wound up on your show?
[00:14:32.574 --> 00:14:36.937]  Sure, he called me a few weeks ago and said that he loves this country.
[00:14:37.177 --> 00:14:38.258]  He has nothing to gain from this.
[00:14:38.318 --> 00:14:39.599]  In fact, it's dangerous for him to do.
[00:14:39.779 --> 00:14:43.321]  But he said, I love this country and my kids so much that I'm going to do this, Alex.
[00:14:43.501 --> 00:14:49.485]  And I said, God bless you, because now it may spur other Hollywood people who've got major pull, who know the truth, to start going public.
[00:14:49.625 --> 00:14:56.534]  And dangerous indeed to do because a lot of what he said makes a lot of people sort of sit back and say, whoa, I don't know about that.
[00:14:56.554 --> 00:15:02.000]  And what's really important here, you may not agree with everything that Charlie Sheen had to say.
[00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:09.009]  I personally think it's a good thing that he did go on your show so he'd go public with his point of view because it does get people talking.
[00:15:09.349 --> 00:15:15.717]  You know, there are a lot of people who may look at this, however, and say there just goes another Hollywood nutjob shooting off his mouth.
[00:15:15.857 --> 00:15:24.747]  I imagine that you think, though, having a Hollywood actor on your side is a good thing, and as you mentioned, may bring some more people to the table talking about this.
[00:15:24.867 --> 00:15:25.347]  Sure, sure.
[00:15:25.367 --> 00:15:30.290]  I mean, if you knew some of the Hollywood names that are aware of 9-11, we're talking some of the biggest people.
[00:15:30.350 --> 00:15:32.712]  And any you can tell us about that you've been in contact with?
[00:15:32.732 --> 00:15:39.756]  No, I can't, because people in Hollywood contact me because I have integrity, and I've been in a few films, and they know me, and they know I keep my mouth shut.
[00:15:40.116 --> 00:15:41.857]  You know, it was kind of like back in high school.
[00:15:42.197 --> 00:15:45.299]  I learned to keep my mouth shut about girls I was dating, and all the girls start liking you.
[00:15:45.519 --> 00:15:46.620]  Look, it's really simple.
[00:15:46.980 --> 00:15:48.341]  Let's understand this, okay?
[00:15:49.384 --> 00:15:50.905]  9-11 was an inside job.
[00:15:50.945 --> 00:15:52.586]  It was a self-inflicted wound.
[00:15:53.107 --> 00:15:55.969]  And what Charlie Sheen is doing is just amazing.
[00:15:56.009 --> 00:15:57.730]  And he can only be commended for it.
[00:15:57.910 --> 00:16:00.492]  And all he's calling for is a real investigation.
[00:16:00.612 --> 00:16:03.634]  I go further at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:16:03.974 --> 00:16:06.055]  We lay out how it happened, what took place.
[00:16:06.075 --> 00:16:07.977]  And it's not just Charlie Sheen I've interviewed.
[00:16:08.037 --> 00:16:09.237]  CNN has interviewed some of these people.
[00:16:09.277 --> 00:16:11.139]  The only network that I've seen doing it.
[00:16:11.399 --> 00:16:12.380]  You guys have interviewed.
[00:16:12.660 --> 00:16:14.821]  There have been physics professors that have gone public.
[00:16:14.861 --> 00:16:17.063]  There have been the heads of mining colleges that have gone public.
[00:16:19.364 --> 00:16:28.908]  Seniors, top CIA advisor who briefed him and briefed Ronald Reagan, one of the highest level guys in the CIA, says our government is clearly involved in carrying out terror to blame it on foreign enemies.
[00:16:29.088 --> 00:16:38.012]  Did you know that on CIA.gov, they admit that they carried out terror attacks in 1953 to blame it on Mohammad Mosaddegh in Iran as a pretext to overthrow?
[00:16:38.252 --> 00:16:45.518]  Alex, all good stuff and all stuff that needs to be talked about, but I'm going to rein you back in here to the topic at hand.
[00:16:45.658 --> 00:16:49.601]  One thing that I think is interesting, as I mentioned, we've gotten this overwhelming response.
[00:16:49.661 --> 00:16:51.262]  The email has not stopped coming in.
[00:16:51.763 --> 00:16:58.628]  Most of the email I've been getting has been supporting the fact that we are bringing attention to something that is rarely talked about in mainstream media.
[00:16:58.648 --> 00:16:59.489]  Yes, sir, you have courage.
[00:17:00.730 --> 00:17:02.191]  And I appreciate you saying that.
[00:17:02.211 --> 00:17:03.391]  So the question is why?
[00:17:03.552 --> 00:17:09.756]  Why have so many of the major media outlets not talked about these alternative theories that exist behind 9-11?
[00:17:09.856 --> 00:17:10.516]  Why is that?
[00:17:10.977 --> 00:17:15.280]  Mark Twain said that in the beginning, a patriot is a scarce man hated and feared and scorned.
[00:17:15.300 --> 00:17:19.563]  But in time, when his cause succeeds, the timid join him because then it costs nothing to be a patriot.
[00:17:19.803 --> 00:17:23.225]  A lot of people don't have the courage that you have, A.J.
[00:17:23.245 --> 00:17:25.527]  A lot of people don't have the courage of Charlie Sheen.
[00:17:25.707 --> 00:17:28.689]  They don't have the courage of the German defense minister, Andres von Buech.
[00:17:28.989 --> 00:17:32.593]  What do you think they're afraid of that's going to happen to them?
[00:17:32.913 --> 00:17:44.363]  They're afraid of being beaten up by the hordes of neo-con intimidators who try to go out there with their Gestapo Nazi tactics to try to bludgeon everybody with their blogs and radio shows to shut up.
[00:17:44.584 --> 00:17:47.426]  But they've lost power because people have learned that they're a bunch of liars.
[00:17:47.646 --> 00:17:49.048]  They lied about the WMDs.
[00:17:49.208 --> 00:17:50.349]  They've lied about everything.
[00:17:50.389 --> 00:17:52.251]  And now their credibility is totally blown.
[00:17:53.172 --> 00:17:59.958]  The new White House memo just came out where Bush was talking about staging the shoot-down of American planes to blame it on Saddam.
[00:17:59.998 --> 00:18:00.719]  That's public.
[00:18:00.959 --> 00:18:01.820]  That's admitted.
[00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:10.389]  Well, let's talk about some public documents because obviously experts, government commissions, countless officials have all come out and supported what is the official line on 9-11.
[00:18:10.409 --> 00:18:11.630]  Yeah, they called Henry Kissinger into
[00:18:11.990 --> 00:18:12.150]  Right.
[00:18:12.170 --> 00:18:24.840]  Well, we know that those documents are out there and that people are supporting them, so I guess what some people watching us tonight may be thinking is, well, why the heck should I be listening to Charlie Sheen or to Alex Jones and his website on this matter?
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:25.580]  They shouldn't.
[00:18:25.801 --> 00:18:26.301]  They shouldn't.
[00:18:26.321 --> 00:18:27.041]  They shouldn't believe me.
[00:18:27.061 --> 00:18:27.822]  They shouldn't believe you.
[00:18:27.842 --> 00:18:29.343]  They shouldn't believe George Bush.
[00:18:29.363 --> 00:18:35.508]  They shouldn't believe the King Commission, where almost the entire commission has conflicts of interest and was appointed by Bush.
[00:18:35.528 --> 00:18:36.108]  You've got to love this.
[00:18:36.328 --> 00:18:39.251]  He appoints his own commission, and then the media calls it independent.
[00:18:39.271 --> 00:18:40.672]  Did you know that the 9-11 whitewash process
[00:18:41.312 --> 00:18:42.232]  All right.
[00:18:42.293 --> 00:18:44.714]  I'll tell you what.
[00:18:44.794 --> 00:18:49.256]  What we're going to do, folks, is we're going to back it up a little bit and come back and air the rest of it.
[00:18:49.276 --> 00:18:51.857]  And then we're going to analyze the piece.
[00:18:51.897 --> 00:18:54.138]  And that's from Showbiz Tonight.
[00:18:55.558 --> 00:18:58.540]  CNN even called me and said, we're listening and you're calling it Showbiz Today.
[00:18:58.940 --> 00:18:59.720]  Hey, I'm sorry.
[00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:00.961]  I've had about three hours sleep.
[00:19:00.981 --> 00:19:02.581]  I was on Coast to Coast AM last night.
[00:19:03.362 --> 00:19:05.923]  And I've got Danish TV here with me in studio.
[00:19:06.747 --> 00:19:08.328]  And then I'm going to be back on CNN tonight.
[00:19:08.468 --> 00:19:14.810]  And we just love this CNN show, Showbiz Tonight, letting us come on and tell the truth and put the information out.
[00:19:14.850 --> 00:19:16.330]  So I'm excited about that coming up tonight.
[00:19:16.370 --> 00:19:17.150]  What's 7 o'clock?
[00:19:17.750 --> 00:19:20.431]  It's going to be 7 o'clock Eastern.
[00:19:21.572 --> 00:19:24.092]  And then it's going to re-air at 11 o'clock Eastern.
[00:19:24.132 --> 00:19:26.333]  So it comes on here Central at 6 o'clock.
[00:19:27.433 --> 00:19:31.055]  And then you can also check the Pacific Times as well.
[00:19:31.615 --> 00:19:33.695]  So when we get back, we'll play the rest of that.
[00:19:33.715 --> 00:19:35.756]  And then I've got some comments on it here critiquing it.
[00:19:36.544 --> 00:19:37.164]  That's what we're doing.
[00:19:37.184 --> 00:19:44.608]  And then I'm going to get into the unbelievable handover to the communist Chinese government, our security.
[00:19:45.109 --> 00:19:46.089]  And that should be the headline.
[00:19:46.129 --> 00:19:49.651]  In fact, I expect Watson is writing an article right now.
[00:19:49.711 --> 00:19:56.094]  The headline should be, Chinese Communist Government Front Company Takes Over U.S.
[00:19:56.135 --> 00:19:56.695]  Security.
[00:19:57.315 --> 00:19:58.896]  Because that's exactly what's happening.
[00:20:01.869 --> 00:20:03.570]  What causes foods to spoil?
[00:20:03.990 --> 00:20:06.971]  All produce produces a natural gas which causes ripening.
[00:20:07.291 --> 00:20:12.573]  In addition, foods like onions and garlic emit odors, causing foods to lose their freshness and flavor.
[00:20:12.873 --> 00:20:22.416]  Now there's Forever Fresh for the fridge, a revolutionary new product proven to eliminate refrigerator odors and guaranteed to keep produce fresh at least twice as long as normal.
[00:20:22.676 --> 00:20:24.877]  Nancy McKimson of Jacksonville, Florida says...
[00:20:25.177 --> 00:20:28.459]  Since I started using Forever Fresh, everything stays fresh much longer.
[00:20:28.659 --> 00:20:31.902]  Like strawberries, which now last a couple of weeks instead of just a few days.
[00:20:32.182 --> 00:20:35.704]  Jane Burke of New Jersey says... You know, we eat a lot of salads.
[00:20:35.865 --> 00:20:39.347]  I used to throw out the leftovers because they'd turn brown and they'd shrivel up.
[00:20:39.487 --> 00:20:40.748]  I'm really amazed.
[00:20:40.888 --> 00:20:46.752]  Since I started using Forever Fresh, all my produce stays fresher longer, including the leftovers.
[00:20:46.892 --> 00:20:49.294]  Now I just couldn't get along without Forever Fresh.
[00:20:49.654 --> 00:20:57.782]  To order your Forever Fresh for the fridge, visit the web at foreverfresh.us or call toll-free 1-866-NO-ODERS.
[00:20:57.962 --> 00:20:59.964]  That's 1-866-NO-ODERS.
[00:21:06.370 --> 00:21:09.653]  Currency devaluation, inflation, one and the same.
[00:21:10.373 --> 00:21:11.694]  If you had deposited $100,000 in a bank at 1%,
[00:21:14.716 --> 00:21:20.157]  In a 30-month period dating from May 24, 2005, here is what happened to your funds.
[00:21:20.597 --> 00:21:23.738]  The dollar lost 33% of its value in that time frame.
[00:21:23.998 --> 00:21:25.818]  The bank paid you 1%.
[00:21:25.878 --> 00:21:28.898]  Your $100,000 now has a net purchasing power of $68,000.
[00:21:29.599 --> 00:21:31.659]  Here is reality.
[00:21:32.039 --> 00:21:35.600]  The devaluation of currency equals real inflation.
[00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:39.760]  Keep in mind how the value of your paper assets are measured in dollars.
[00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:42.901]  Gold, in the same time frame, increased 35% in value.
[00:21:44.511 --> 00:21:44.952]  We're good to go.
[00:22:01.428 --> 00:22:10.475]  Now you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as triamethylenes, atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and MTBE to below detectable limits.
[00:22:10.736 --> 00:22:19.743]  Black Fergie elements are so powerful, they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water,
[00:22:19.963 --> 00:22:20.403]  We're good to go.
[00:22:20.463 --> 00:22:21.124]  We're good to go.
[00:22:48.439 --> 00:22:51.662]  On February 29, 1892, the United States of America's Supreme Court declared us a Christian nation.
[00:23:11.806 --> 00:23:21.489]  However, over recent years, for the last three decades, there's been a deliberate war on Christianity in America to wipe out our heritage from the minds of our people.
[00:23:22.389 --> 00:23:29.030]  The First Amendment to the Constitution guarantees us religious freedom, and yet it's under attack today.
[00:23:29.951 --> 00:23:38.733]  We would like to send you a one-year absolutely free subscription to Newswatch Magazine that gives you the background of what is happening in America.
[00:23:39.389 --> 00:23:41.130]  Just call our toll-free number, 1-800-516-8736.
[00:23:41.290 --> 00:23:48.896]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[00:23:52.219 --> 00:23:52.859]  Call now.
[00:23:53.119 --> 00:23:58.684]  Our operators are standing by for an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[00:24:00.985 --> 00:24:06.950]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:09.048 --> 00:24:14.832]  My friends, it is a circus today here at the InfoWars headquarters.
[00:24:16.113 --> 00:24:19.955]  Danish TV, really great guys, they set this up months ago to beer today.
[00:24:21.016 --> 00:24:29.982]  And so they get the shell-shocked Alex Jones, exhausted with two or three hours of sleep last night as I was getting on Coast to Coast AM and did CNN before that and a bunch of other...
[00:24:30.950 --> 00:24:31.690]  A bunch of other things.
[00:24:31.710 --> 00:24:33.811]  I set Charlie up for the show last night.
[00:24:33.831 --> 00:24:35.052]  I had a great chance to talk to him.
[00:24:35.072 --> 00:24:36.012]  He's such a wonderful guy.
[00:24:36.032 --> 00:24:37.173]  So informed.
[00:24:37.413 --> 00:24:38.493]  And Charlie Sheen is joining us.
[00:24:38.533 --> 00:24:44.476]  Last 30 minutes of the broadcast coming up later in the broadcast.
[00:24:45.256 --> 00:24:49.278]  And then, I guess, if you're MTV Canada, I'm going to be on there tonight.
[00:24:49.538 --> 00:24:52.279]  And then back on CNN this evening as well.
[00:24:52.359 --> 00:24:53.720]  So a full plate.
[00:24:53.780 --> 00:24:57.041]  I tell you, I was going to come in tonight and work on the new documentary film.
[00:24:57.782 --> 00:25:01.826]  But I'll just inform my video editor that's coming up here that he can come up here and work, but I'm not going to be here.
[00:25:01.846 --> 00:25:06.471]  Because as soon as I'm done with all these interviews, I'm going to go crawl into my bed.
[00:25:06.511 --> 00:25:13.198]  I'm going to turn the air conditioner down to about 60 in my bedroom, and I'm going to go hibernate for a while.
[00:25:13.238 --> 00:25:18.724]  You know, I don't normally whine on air, but I'm just saying it for the Danish TV cameras here.
[00:25:21.301 --> 00:25:23.263]  I can tell that I'm a little bit punch drunk here.
[00:25:23.904 --> 00:25:30.413]  Let's get back to the piece from CNN's great show with A.J.
[00:25:30.553 --> 00:25:33.657]  Hammer that I'm just really impressed with, Trailblazing.
[00:25:34.224 --> 00:25:50.236]  The first time that we've seen mainstream, mainline, marquee media allow someone to go on live, and they've done it twice now, two nights in a row, myself and others, and to tell the truth and give the alternative view of what happened on September 11th.
[00:25:50.256 --> 00:25:57.621]  And I'll be back on Showbiz tonight, coming up this evening, 7 o'clock Eastern, 6 o'clock Central, and then it re-airs later.
[00:25:58.042 --> 00:26:02.425]  So check CNN Headline News for schedules in your part of the world.
[00:26:03.149 --> 00:26:08.012]  And I know it is available throughout the planet where they have satellite and cable.
[00:26:08.552 --> 00:26:12.395]  Let's go ahead and go back to the conclusion of the CNN piece.
[00:26:12.415 --> 00:26:12.775]  Here it is.
[00:26:13.419 --> 00:26:21.826]  Well, let's talk about some public documents, because obviously experts, government commissions, countless officials have all come out and supported what is the official line on 9-11.
[00:26:21.846 --> 00:26:23.387]  Yeah, they call Henry Kissinger independent.
[00:26:23.447 --> 00:26:36.277]  Right, well, we know that those documents are out there and that people are supporting them, so I guess what some people watching us tonight may be thinking is, well, why the heck should I be listening to Charlie Sheen or to Alex Jones and his website on this matter?
[00:26:36.437 --> 00:26:37.017]  They shouldn't.
[00:26:37.238 --> 00:26:37.718]  They shouldn't.
[00:26:37.758 --> 00:26:38.458]  They shouldn't believe me.
[00:26:38.498 --> 00:26:39.259]  They shouldn't believe you.
[00:26:39.279 --> 00:26:40.780]  They shouldn't believe George Bush.
[00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:46.684]  They shouldn't believe the King Commission, where almost the entire commission has conflicts of interest and was appointed by Bush.
[00:26:46.724 --> 00:26:47.544]  You've got to love this.
[00:26:47.765 --> 00:26:50.686]  He appoints his own commission, and then the media calls it independent.
[00:26:50.706 --> 00:27:00.393]  Did you know that the 9-11 White Watch Commission claimed there were no columns in Tower 1 and 2 when they had 47 of the biggest columns in the world up until that time?
[00:27:00.613 --> 00:27:04.636]  They won't say why Building 7 has blast points going off down the side.
[00:27:04.696 --> 00:27:04.856]  Well...
[00:27:05.396 --> 00:27:07.437]  Alex, I'm afraid I've got to cut you off because we're out of time.
[00:27:07.677 --> 00:27:09.258]  But as I said, it's sparking debate.
[00:27:09.338 --> 00:27:10.398]  It's getting people talking.
[00:27:10.418 --> 00:27:12.079]  And I appreciate you help bringing that.
[00:27:12.099 --> 00:27:12.359]  Thank you.
[00:27:12.379 --> 00:27:13.800]  Go to InfoWars.com, sir.
[00:27:13.820 --> 00:27:15.320]  Find out the truth at PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:27:15.420 --> 00:27:16.861]  Alex Jones, live from Austin.
[00:27:17.121 --> 00:27:19.362]  And as I mentioned, we've gotten so many emails on the subject.
[00:27:19.402 --> 00:27:21.903]  We'll read some of what you have to say coming up a bit later in the show.
[00:27:21.923 --> 00:27:23.624]  Welcome back to Showbiz Tonight.
[00:27:23.664 --> 00:27:24.064]  I'm A.J.
[00:27:24.104 --> 00:27:24.924]  Hammer in New York.
[00:27:24.964 --> 00:27:27.245]  This is TV's only live entertainment news show.
[00:27:27.285 --> 00:27:30.787]  We have been getting an overwhelming response to a Showbiz Tonight question of the day.
[00:27:30.827 --> 00:27:31.287]  We've been asking...
[00:27:31.687 --> 00:27:33.068]  Charlie Sheen speaks out.
[00:27:33.148 --> 00:27:36.289]  Do you agree there is a government cover-up of 9-11?
[00:27:36.329 --> 00:27:38.931]  Here's the vote so far.
[00:27:38.951 --> 00:27:39.851]  67% of you say yes.
[00:27:40.571 --> 00:27:42.032]  33% of you say no.
[00:27:42.272 --> 00:27:45.694]  Some of the emails we've received include one from Jennifer in North Dakota.
[00:27:45.714 --> 00:27:47.855]  She writes, Charlie Sheen has no evidence.
[00:27:48.195 --> 00:27:52.556]  And it is a shame that celebs get their voice and opinions heard because of their status.
[00:27:52.636 --> 00:27:54.297]  We also heard from Danny, who lives in Kentucky.
[00:27:54.657 --> 00:28:01.759]  Danny says, God bless Charlie Sheen for standing up and speaking his mind on what is the most devastating event to hit our nation, 9-11.
[00:28:01.799 --> 00:28:03.780]  We also heard from Chris in Ohio.
[00:28:03.820 --> 00:28:07.521]  Chris writes, this is a very important issue that must be brought into the mainstream.
[00:28:07.801 --> 00:28:12.843]  It is our patriotic duty to make sure we find out why and how 9-11 happened.
[00:28:13.263 --> 00:28:16.364]  There's the address to keep voting, cnn.com slash showbiztonight.
[00:28:17.199 --> 00:28:17.599]  All right.
[00:28:18.159 --> 00:28:21.900]  By the way, you can go to Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:28:21.920 --> 00:28:24.261]  We've got big links over to CNN.
[00:28:24.481 --> 00:28:28.182]  And by about 10 o'clock last night, it went above 80%.
[00:28:29.143 --> 00:28:32.944]  And now I've been watching it this morning, and I was watching it at 4 a.m.
[00:28:32.984 --> 00:28:33.864]  when I was on the radio.
[00:28:34.624 --> 00:28:36.065]  And it's been 82% ever since, with 14,254 votes cast.
[00:28:36.085 --> 00:28:38.006]  And you can only vote once, folks, so that's good.
[00:28:38.026 --> 00:28:39.486]  It is 82% to 18 out of 14,254 total votes.
[00:28:39.506 --> 00:28:43.648]  11,713 votes saying that they agree with Charlie Sheen about the 9-11 cover-up.
[00:28:43.668 --> 00:28:44.829]  And we've got 2,541 votes.
[00:28:58.815 --> 00:29:00.375]  We're good to go.
[00:29:00.475 --> 00:29:01.076]  We're good to go.
[00:29:28.894 --> 00:29:37.997]  When they closed it out, it had 90%, and that's posted on our websites as well, and links over to CNN where it's posted.
[00:29:38.017 --> 00:29:42.519]  So, I guess, you know, we're the conspiracy theorists, huh?
[00:29:42.939 --> 00:29:48.701]  Well, I guess those of you that buy the government conspiracy theory, you're getting to be a smaller and smaller minority, aren't you?
[00:29:51.622 --> 00:29:52.542]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.002 --> 00:29:54.623]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.523 --> 00:29:58.204]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.787 --> 00:30:02.368]  Are you sick of
[00:30:22.523 --> 00:30:23.604]  So take matters into your own hands.
[00:30:38.817 --> 00:30:39.178]  Call 888-203-6633 today.
[00:31:01.553 --> 00:31:07.798]  The illuminated Berkey base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[00:31:07.938 --> 00:31:14.103]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[00:31:14.383 --> 00:31:22.810]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[00:31:23.070 --> 00:31:30.096]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter, and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[00:31:30.396 --> 00:31:35.199]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[00:31:35.419 --> 00:31:40.823]  The Berkey base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[00:31:41.163 --> 00:31:44.245]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[00:31:44.586 --> 00:31:52.491]  Get the illuminated Berkey base for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:31:52.591 --> 00:31:53.171]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[00:32:02.497 --> 00:32:06.117]  Yes, there is a choice, a real alternative, when it comes to news and information.
[00:32:06.578 --> 00:32:10.539]  The GCN Radio Network has become the world leader for those who want to know the truth.

[00:33:12.401 --> 00:33:21.728]  We're going to be taking your calls here in this segment and get into the whole...
[00:33:31.477 --> 00:33:33.898]  Communist Chinese government takeover of our port security.
[00:33:34.478 --> 00:33:35.378]  That's no joke.
[00:33:35.418 --> 00:33:38.999]  That's who Mainstream News admits runs Hutchinson-Wampo.
[00:33:39.439 --> 00:33:45.661]  Chinese naval generals of their navy are captain of all Hutchinson-Wampo ships.
[00:33:46.022 --> 00:33:58.325]  They are intelligence vessels, each and every one of them, and most of their crews, this is admitted, are PLA naval officers and PLA Chinese military commandos.
[00:33:58.425 --> 00:34:00.166]  Now, you can go read that
[00:34:00.806 --> 00:34:11.454]  In congressional intelligence declassified testimonies going back eight years ago during the controversy when Clinton in 96 began handing over Long Beach and other ports.
[00:34:11.994 --> 00:34:16.457]  It came out in 2000 when the communist Chinese Hutchinson Wampo finally took over the Panama Canal.
[00:34:16.897 --> 00:34:21.701]  And now, even the Washington Times admits tens of thousands of Chinese troops are in Panama.
[00:34:22.141 --> 00:34:23.522]  I mean, you talk about encirclement.
[00:34:23.542 --> 00:34:25.243]  You talk about a science fiction horror movie.
[00:34:25.583 --> 00:34:26.084]  This is it.
[00:34:26.184 --> 00:34:27.685]  Now, I want to go back into Sheen for a second.
[00:34:27.745 --> 00:34:29.186]  I want to just state something for the record.
[00:34:31.195 --> 00:34:33.657]  I knew what I was doing last night when I went on CNN.
[00:34:33.737 --> 00:34:47.785]  No one has ever gotten on national TV, not the 9-11 Truth people, not the other great folks that have gone on, not Jimmy Walters, none of them, and said the government absolutely did it.
[00:34:48.285 --> 00:34:51.667]  They just said the government's covering up and clearly there were bombs and blah, blah, blah.
[00:34:51.848 --> 00:34:54.209]  I clearly went on and fingered the government.
[00:34:55.126 --> 00:34:55.566]  Thank you.
[00:34:55.626 --> 00:34:55.846]  Thank you.
[00:35:16.101 --> 00:35:17.442]  I think we're good to go.
[00:35:39.087 --> 00:35:45.711]  So, you know, at certain levels, it's better to just face the enemy as they roll against you and to be able to physically deal with it.
[00:35:46.332 --> 00:35:53.517]  And frankly, I, at many levels of my psyche, would just rather have it straight up like that so I'd know what I was dealing with.
[00:35:54.858 --> 00:36:01.022]  Because the establishment does not like it when it's just thrown directly in their face on national TV.
[00:36:01.062 --> 00:36:02.343]  And I'm going back on tonight.
[00:36:03.300 --> 00:36:07.344]  And I assure you folks, I will never commit suicide.
[00:36:07.404 --> 00:36:08.125]  I love life.
[00:36:08.205 --> 00:36:08.846]  I drink it up.
[00:36:09.607 --> 00:36:11.689]  I just love what a beautiful sunny day it is.
[00:36:11.809 --> 00:36:13.451]  Springtime in Austin, Texas.
[00:36:13.491 --> 00:36:15.873]  Crispy day, about 60 degrees.
[00:36:15.893 --> 00:36:18.676]  I love my life.
[00:36:18.876 --> 00:36:20.238]  I love going fishing.
[00:36:20.258 --> 00:36:21.339]  I love going out on a boat.
[00:36:21.439 --> 00:36:24.382]  I love going to the beach and building sandcastles.
[00:36:25.396 --> 00:36:26.477]  I mean, I have a life to live.
[00:36:26.517 --> 00:36:27.138]  I'm a young man.
[00:36:27.358 --> 00:36:28.579]  I'm 32 years old.
[00:36:28.599 --> 00:36:33.463]  But think about how many young men are dying right now for a war that's a fraud, who are 18, 24 years old.
[00:36:33.503 --> 00:36:36.426]  I think 24 is about the average age over in Iraq right now.
[00:36:36.466 --> 00:36:39.889]  And their whole future is being destroyed by DU, depleted uranium.
[00:36:39.909 --> 00:36:41.730]  And my family's breathing depleted uranium right now.
[00:36:41.810 --> 00:36:42.631]  Your family's breathing it.
[00:36:42.671 --> 00:36:45.714]  So they're already hurting us and killing us and doing bad things.
[00:36:45.754 --> 00:36:47.215]  And all I'm doing is what I have to do.
[00:36:47.535 --> 00:36:48.336]  I'm standing up.
[00:36:49.304 --> 00:37:00.370]  And the key to this is being up front, saying that we know killers run this government, saying that we know we're in danger, gives us the best insurance policy we've got.
[00:37:00.790 --> 00:37:12.696]  So I want everybody to remember the type of, I'm not tooting my horn here, but the type of courage that Charlie Sheen has shown and really the survival instinct that I'm showing here against a criminal elite that carries out terror attacks.
[00:37:12.776 --> 00:37:18.379]  I mean, when there's declassified documents and admissions and we know how they carried it out, we have a duty to talk about it.
[00:37:19.150 --> 00:37:22.172]  And that's what I started doing four and a half years ago on the day of 9-11.
[00:37:22.212 --> 00:37:23.193]  It's what I started before 9-11.
[00:37:23.473 --> 00:37:24.734]  And it's what I do now.
[00:37:24.834 --> 00:37:35.402]  So I hope people realize that I have sworn my trust, my sacred honor, my treasure.
[00:37:36.642 --> 00:37:37.103]  We're good to go.
[00:37:56.481 --> 00:38:05.024]  And I think God is opening windows for people to at least be warned and let America know the truth before we get judged further.
[00:38:05.064 --> 00:38:10.145]  In fact, let me just go to the Declaration of Independence, page 26 in my Citizen Rulebook here.
[00:38:10.165 --> 00:38:16.127]  Let me just read, as I did a few days ago, what the Founding Fathers said.
[00:38:17.187 --> 00:38:23.989]  We therefore, the representatives of the United States of America and General Congress assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world...
[00:38:24.847 --> 00:38:48.654]  For the rectitude of our intentions, do in the name and by authority of the good people of these colonies solemnly publish and declare that these united colonies are, and of right ought to be, free and independent states, that they are absolved from all allegiance to the British crown, and that all political connections between them and the state of Great Britain is and ought to be totally dissolved, and that a free and independent...
[00:38:50.290 --> 00:38:51.971]  And that is what I do here today.
[00:38:51.991 --> 00:38:52.612]  I pledge my life.
[00:39:21.973 --> 00:39:23.274]  I pledge my sacred honor.
[00:39:23.935 --> 00:39:26.297]  I pledge my blood, sweat, and tears.
[00:39:26.457 --> 00:39:27.578]  I commit fully.
[00:39:27.598 --> 00:39:33.764]  I am way past the point of no return in a toe-to-toe battle with the NWO.
[00:39:34.424 --> 00:39:36.406]  And you're in that battle whether you know it or not.
[00:39:36.466 --> 00:39:37.828]  You cannot sit on the sidelines.
[00:39:37.888 --> 00:39:40.550]  It will run you over one way or the other.
[00:39:40.610 --> 00:39:43.853]  You can either lay down to it or you can stand up and fight it and try to defeat it.
[00:39:44.825 --> 00:39:47.406]  You can listen to all your phony preachers telling you to lay down.
[00:39:48.107 --> 00:39:55.911]  You can listen to them twisting the scripture to tell you to go along with the New World Order, to go along with tyranny, that you're supposed to lay there and get your guts torn out by these wolves.
[00:39:56.451 --> 00:39:57.451]  That is not the case.
[00:39:57.571 --> 00:39:59.592]  We have to stand up against this.
[00:39:59.652 --> 00:40:01.313]  We have to resist this.
[00:40:01.353 --> 00:40:08.617]  We have to stand up for our future progeny, for those that will see us as their ancestors.
[00:40:09.545 --> 00:40:22.094]  And we stand on the shoulders in an unbroken chain with our ancestors throughout all of human existence who have always struggled against the strongmen, the king rats, the dictators, the abusive kings, the oligarchies.
[00:40:22.555 --> 00:40:33.663]  And we stand against these inbred scum who are completely corrupt and who are sadistic and have no right to steer the affairs and the dynamic human process.
[00:40:33.683 --> 00:40:35.244]  They have been running us down a rat hole.
[00:40:35.604 --> 00:40:37.666]  They have been suppressing technological developments.
[00:40:37.706 --> 00:40:38.827]  They have been keeping it from us.
[00:40:39.307 --> 00:40:39.828]  We're good to go.
[00:41:02.628 --> 00:41:05.889]  You know, the Navy dumping nuclear reactors off the coast of California.
[00:41:06.089 --> 00:41:07.629]  I mean, why do they do this?
[00:41:07.769 --> 00:41:08.389]  They drink it.
[00:41:08.449 --> 00:41:08.969]  They eat it.
[00:41:09.549 --> 00:41:10.409]  They eat the fish.
[00:41:10.489 --> 00:41:13.310]  I mean, they're just... These people are psychopathic.
[00:41:13.650 --> 00:41:19.051]  And all we're doing is looking at the facts and saying, we're not going along with this anymore.
[00:41:19.911 --> 00:41:20.651]  Humanity.
[00:41:21.371 --> 00:41:23.172]  Listen, I'm not worried about my own life.
[00:41:23.232 --> 00:41:25.012]  I'm only worried about the future.
[00:41:25.432 --> 00:41:28.212]  I'm worried about the little ones who don't know and who are innocent.
[00:41:28.612 --> 00:41:31.493]  And as warriors, as men, and as women...
[00:41:32.082 --> 00:41:47.965]  When the enemy comes into the cave, when the enemy comes in to take us captive or to kill us, or when the enemy comes in to devour us, we must rally with our full intellect and our physical prowess to fully engage.
[00:41:48.225 --> 00:41:49.485]  I will not lay down.
[00:41:49.865 --> 00:41:51.066]  I will not roll over.
[00:41:53.106 --> 00:41:57.707]  And by exposing the terrorism, by standing up against it, by resisting it,
[00:41:58.445 --> 00:42:08.031]  We may stop the New World Order from engaging in more terror attacks because if enough people realize they're behind it and enough people won't go along with their program, they will be forced to stop it.
[00:42:08.051 --> 00:42:10.013]  They will be forced to stop engaging in it.
[00:42:10.113 --> 00:42:13.915]  Now, I just want to briefly get into the whole port situation.
[00:42:13.935 --> 00:42:15.316]  We'll take calls and then get more into it.
[00:42:15.356 --> 00:42:16.597]  This is the Associated Press.
[00:42:17.097 --> 00:42:17.298]  U.S.
[00:42:17.318 --> 00:42:19.339]  hiring Hong Kong company to scan cargo.
[00:42:19.379 --> 00:42:20.220]  Now, let me stop right there.
[00:42:21.420 --> 00:42:23.762]  Hutchinson Wampo is admittedly
[00:42:24.938 --> 00:42:30.381]  A holding of the Communist Chinese Navy and the People's Army.
[00:42:31.762 --> 00:42:32.122]  Okay?
[00:42:33.222 --> 00:42:38.205]  That is admitted congressional documents, mainstream news.
[00:42:38.585 --> 00:42:50.551]  The government of China openly owns the majority stock in the company, and their officers and their first mates on all of these ships are...
[00:42:51.619 --> 00:42:55.280]  Officers in the Chinese military.
[00:42:56.540 --> 00:43:01.301]  And many of their sailors are Navy scrubs as well.
[00:43:03.081 --> 00:43:04.481]  And this is what's happening.
[00:43:04.521 --> 00:43:05.722]  And they have the Panama Canal.
[00:43:05.762 --> 00:43:06.662]  They have multiple U.S.
[00:43:06.702 --> 00:43:06.982]  ports.
[00:43:07.282 --> 00:43:11.483]  They have the only major deepwater port on the West Coast, Long Beach.
[00:43:11.723 --> 00:43:13.403]  My first film was about that, okay?
[00:43:14.243 --> 00:43:15.763]  And we yelled about it when Bill Clinton did it.
[00:43:16.523 --> 00:43:19.484]  Now, at the major nexus point,
[00:43:20.109 --> 00:43:30.413]  Where many of the larger ships come in and then offload into smaller freighters to be brought into Houston and brought into Corpus Christi and brought into New Orleans and brought into Miami.
[00:43:33.255 --> 00:43:35.756]  They are taking over the entire infrastructure.
[00:43:36.296 --> 00:43:40.318]  And now it's not bad enough that five years ago they took over Freeport, Bahamas.
[00:43:41.118 --> 00:43:45.220]  Now they are going to run the security there.
[00:43:45.320 --> 00:43:46.440]  Do you understand?
[00:43:46.480 --> 00:43:47.200]  Let me read from...
[00:43:50.456 --> 00:44:09.651]  Directly from the Associated Press, quote, the Bush administration says it is finalizing a no-bid contract with Hutchinson Wampo LTD that acknowledges the deal is the first time a foreign company will be involved in running a radiation detector at an overseas port without American customs agents present.
[00:44:11.372 --> 00:44:15.535]  And that is a holding, again, of the United States, a protectorate, a possession.
[00:44:16.136 --> 00:44:17.497]  Not a protectorate, excuse me, a possession.
[00:44:18.977 --> 00:44:22.339]  And now just listen to that one paragraph.
[00:44:23.060 --> 00:44:23.640]  Excuse me.
[00:44:24.501 --> 00:44:27.743]  The Bush administration says it is finalizing a no-bid contract.
[00:44:27.763 --> 00:44:28.003]  Right there.
[00:44:28.343 --> 00:44:29.144]  Let's take that first point.
[00:44:29.164 --> 00:44:29.564]  There's three.
[00:44:30.544 --> 00:44:31.825]  No-bid contract.
[00:44:32.366 --> 00:44:43.793]  Do you understand that they started this new thing in Iraq where they will only give Halliburton and a few other companies just massive multi-billion dollar contracts on a monthly basis?
[00:44:44.625 --> 00:44:45.206]  We're good to go.
[00:45:10.112 --> 00:45:16.374]  Now, they're going to give the communist Chinese military, and that is not an exaggeration.
[00:45:16.414 --> 00:45:17.975]  That is the exact thing.
[00:45:18.235 --> 00:45:19.895]  That is precisely what this is.
[00:45:20.456 --> 00:45:20.956]  No debate.
[00:45:21.996 --> 00:45:22.696]  No discussion.
[00:45:24.497 --> 00:45:39.362]  A no-bid contract when I guarantee you, I guarantee you an American company or another nation more friendly than the communist Chinese who routinely threaten to nuke and attack this country.
[00:45:40.407 --> 00:45:43.589]  Do you understand the magnitude of that?
[00:45:43.970 --> 00:45:45.171]  Do you realize?
[00:45:45.791 --> 00:45:55.158]  And then it goes on to say that it's the first time this has happened, and it goes on to say that it is the first time there will be no customs agents overseeing this.
[00:45:56.019 --> 00:46:00.782]  And they've already caught the communist Chinese companies at Long Beach, L.A.
[00:46:00.822 --> 00:46:05.005]  Times, 1996, before they even controlled the Long Beach Naval Base.
[00:46:06.046 --> 00:46:09.669]  They caught them at the Long Beach port bringing in heroin,
[00:46:10.655 --> 00:46:11.375]  And 3,000 AK-47s.
[00:46:12.036 --> 00:46:21.460]  And then they caught another Chinese control company shipping in LAWS rockets, and that is rocket-propelled grenades, to be precise.
[00:46:21.520 --> 00:46:29.124]  LAWS rockets are U.S.-designed small bazooka, to be technical, RPGs, rocket-propelled grenades.
[00:46:31.545 --> 00:46:35.007]  I mean, this is just... Again, it's past Twilight Zone.
[00:46:37.188 --> 00:46:39.709]  And I just...
[00:46:40.552 --> 00:46:41.433]  I'm flabbergasted.
[00:46:41.773 --> 00:46:42.834]  I'm flabbergasted every day now.
[00:46:43.494 --> 00:46:46.177]  I mean, just when I think it's... And it's going to get crazier than this, okay?
[00:46:47.217 --> 00:46:51.981]  I mean, we have Mexican troops patrolling America.
[00:46:52.001 --> 00:46:53.643]  And last time I checked, they're still in New Orleans.
[00:46:54.784 --> 00:46:57.586]  We have private mercs doing it, now taking over sheriff's departments.
[00:46:59.888 --> 00:47:00.128]  Now.
[00:47:01.889 --> 00:47:02.970]  I mean, this is all going on.
[00:47:03.891 --> 00:47:07.674]  And they've signed deals to bring in foreign troops to quote police America and deal with American terrorists.
[00:47:09.215 --> 00:47:10.156]  It's really happening.
[00:47:11.801 --> 00:47:15.184]  And meanwhile, the neocons are busy defending George Bush, saying how great he is.
[00:47:15.224 --> 00:47:16.945]  I mean, these people are the scum of the earth.
[00:47:17.306 --> 00:47:19.267]  Ernie in New Jersey, thanks for holding her on the air.
[00:47:19.507 --> 00:47:20.008]  God bless.
[00:47:20.288 --> 00:47:23.991]  Everything you do.
[00:47:24.011 --> 00:47:24.711]  A couple things.
[00:47:26.153 --> 00:47:34.279]  I think we're in a state like we're, to every shy vote, American people in general, we've been, all kinds of things have been done to us.
[00:47:34.299 --> 00:47:39.143]  I think we can still rise up out of bed if we pull together.
[00:47:41.932 --> 00:47:43.073]  There's so much going on.
[00:47:43.093 --> 00:47:45.814]  Lou Dobbs, what you talked about, just mentioned it yesterday.
[00:47:45.834 --> 00:47:46.835]  He said they're going to be watching it.
[00:47:46.875 --> 00:47:48.816]  We should start supporting people like Lou Dobbs.
[00:47:48.876 --> 00:47:52.397]  Anybody who talks about these things, even though we don't agree with everything they say.
[00:47:52.417 --> 00:47:55.859]  I think it's to our benefit.
[00:47:57.760 --> 00:47:59.961]  These people are not... We're the people.
[00:48:01.102 --> 00:48:01.682]  We're the people.
[00:48:01.922 --> 00:48:02.582]  We're the government.
[00:48:02.642 --> 00:48:04.383]  These people are not the government.
[00:48:04.904 --> 00:48:06.304]  They're criminals in our government.
[00:48:06.324 --> 00:48:08.726]  I hope there's a distinction put.
[00:48:08.746 --> 00:48:09.766]  This is not our government.
[00:48:09.806 --> 00:48:11.547]  These are criminals in our government.
[00:48:11.966 --> 00:48:13.167]  There can be no debate.
[00:48:13.267 --> 00:48:17.770]  They give themselves no-bid contracts, and now they give them to the Chinese military to run our security?
[00:48:17.790 --> 00:48:20.192]  It's unbelievable.
[00:48:20.272 --> 00:48:25.655]  Louis Lampin from Harper's Excellent was on C-SPAN a couple days ago.
[00:48:25.675 --> 00:48:28.097]  Basically, he's like a quiet Alex Jones.
[00:48:29.598 --> 00:48:39.905]  He was talking about everything, and the people calling up, they were saying, basically, people call up your show, but they're being involved and lying.
[00:48:39.945 --> 00:48:41.086]  It's amazing.
[00:48:41.550 --> 00:48:42.510]  People are starting to find out.
[00:48:42.951 --> 00:48:45.832]  I think like Terri Schiavo, you followed Terri Schiavo.
[00:48:46.412 --> 00:48:46.932]  Different ways.
[00:48:47.293 --> 00:48:57.717]  Okay, the more people's left right, we've been clintonized and bushflashed for a long time, but people get away from that and they realize you had Republicans, you had Democrats, you had liberals defending her.
[00:48:57.797 --> 00:49:00.899]  The more people find out the truth, you can see.
[00:49:01.959 --> 00:49:06.922]  Everybody is so important, even people in nursing homes who can't do nothing except pray.
[00:49:07.242 --> 00:49:09.923]  Everybody is so important, it's unbelievable in God's sight.
[00:49:10.706 --> 00:49:12.008]  I think we've turned a corner.
[00:49:12.589 --> 00:49:17.117]  I'm just sorry people like Bill Cooper, who I listened to in the beginning.
[00:49:17.317 --> 00:49:18.219]  Yeah, they murdered him.
[00:49:19.020 --> 00:49:21.143]  Let me ask you a question.
[00:49:21.163 --> 00:49:22.686]  What are you guys going to do if I get murdered?
[00:49:22.746 --> 00:49:23.307]  What are you going to do?
[00:49:27.358 --> 00:49:31.900]  You know, if they do kill me, they're going to demonize me after they kill me, and I hope you guys will support me out there.
[00:49:32.260 --> 00:49:46.846]  I just know about half the patriot movement is their own plants, and that's one thing I'm frustrated by, that if they kill me, then I'm going to have all these plants attacking me after I'm dead, and a lot of you poor folks out there are going to buy their lives.
[00:49:46.866 --> 00:49:47.607]  It's too late.
[00:49:47.667 --> 00:49:48.767]  It's too late.
[00:49:48.787 --> 00:49:50.588]  See, if I hadn't heard...
[00:49:51.260 --> 00:49:54.902]  Well, Cooper, if I listened to you, I would have thought you were in that case.
[00:49:55.963 --> 00:49:58.625]  So people, listen to other people, tell the truth.
[00:49:58.985 --> 00:50:00.446]  It's gone too far now.
[00:50:00.466 --> 00:50:01.947]  We're way past that point.
[00:50:02.807 --> 00:50:03.908]  We're way past that point.
[00:50:03.988 --> 00:50:05.669]  We'll worry if anything happens to you.
[00:50:06.249 --> 00:50:08.051]  Well, listen, I appreciate your call, my friend.
[00:50:08.071 --> 00:50:11.133]  Now, I mean, I can be at the grocery store.
[00:50:11.153 --> 00:50:12.874]  I can be in a restaurant.
[00:50:12.894 --> 00:50:14.795]  I mean, they're nice people.
[00:50:14.815 --> 00:50:19.538]  They're fans of the show, but they just say it like it's funny because they're so disconnected still from reality.
[00:50:20.239 --> 00:50:22.219]  They go, man, I'm surprised you're still alive.
[00:50:22.280 --> 00:50:24.460]  I'm surprised I hadn't killed you yet.
[00:50:24.500 --> 00:50:25.600]  Hey, you're talking to me.
[00:50:26.200 --> 00:50:27.521]  You're talking about my life.
[00:50:29.761 --> 00:50:32.962]  You know, I mention this sometimes because I think about it because, I mean, people just walk up.
[00:50:33.002 --> 00:50:34.202]  Why aren't you dead yet?
[00:50:36.883 --> 00:50:39.544]  And I just, it's my life, you know.
[00:50:39.764 --> 00:50:42.784]  I just have a little respect about it.
[00:50:42.804 --> 00:50:44.265]  I'm willing to sacrifice it.
[00:50:44.285 --> 00:50:45.045]  I'm more than willing.
[00:50:46.480 --> 00:50:49.027]  I mean, it's the greatest form of service there is, but I am not.
[00:50:49.388 --> 00:50:51.673]  Just please don't poo-poo it.
[00:50:52.255 --> 00:50:53.377]  Don't turn it into a joke.
[00:50:54.260 --> 00:50:55.503]  I appreciate you, sir, not doing that.
[00:50:56.744 --> 00:51:00.905]  We'll be right back.
[00:51:01.425 --> 00:51:02.925]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:51:03.125 --> 00:51:06.206]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[00:51:06.326 --> 00:51:10.226]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[00:51:10.286 --> 00:51:14.507]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State to the Takeover.
[00:51:14.867 --> 00:51:18.628]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[00:51:18.708 --> 00:51:20.628]  The civil emergency was created by the police.
[00:51:20.768 --> 00:51:24.069]  Riot police attacked people on the street indiscriminately.
[00:51:24.109 --> 00:51:25.209]  The medical bills...
[00:51:26.830 --> 00:51:28.831]  Are going to be enormous for me.
[00:51:28.991 --> 00:51:32.032]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[00:51:32.212 --> 00:51:35.114]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[00:51:35.554 --> 00:51:41.677]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[00:51:42.217 --> 00:51:43.758]  The number to order the takeover again is 888-253-3139
[00:52:00.891 --> 00:52:08.394]  Get the new Berkey battery adapter, an inexpensive yet long-term backup power supply for your Berkey Light LED system.
[00:52:08.674 --> 00:52:21.620]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because, incredibly, they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark, yet require very little energy.
[00:52:21.940 --> 00:52:25.263]  That's why this revolutionary new technology is a bit expensive.
[00:52:25.603 --> 00:52:36.071]  But it's worth every penny, because the low-energy LEDs are able to provide light all night long for over two weeks on a single set of four AA alkaline batteries.
[00:52:36.352 --> 00:52:36.852]  That's right.
[00:52:37.032 --> 00:52:44.138]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[00:52:44.418 --> 00:52:53.168]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey battery adapter, complete with on-off switch for only $10 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:52:53.228 --> 00:52:53.688]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[00:53:02.970 --> 00:53:08.899]  Herbal Healer Academy is the global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.
[00:53:09.140 --> 00:53:11.383]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.
[00:53:11.584 --> 00:53:17.954]  We provide outstanding products like Esiac, colloidal silver 500 parts per million, olive leaf extract,
[00:53:18.274 --> 00:53:18.914]  We're good to go.
[00:53:38.442 --> 00:53:38.782]  We're good to go.
[00:54:21.271 --> 00:54:24.193]  And I won't back down.
[00:54:24.913 --> 00:54:30.096]  I like what else he says.
[00:54:30.156 --> 00:54:30.276]  Hey!
[00:54:49.975 --> 00:54:50.775]  I know what's right.
[00:54:50.835 --> 00:54:51.916]  I've got just one line.
[00:54:52.276 --> 00:54:53.957]  All right.
[00:54:53.977 --> 00:54:57.298]  Let's go ahead and go back to your calls.
[00:54:57.338 --> 00:55:05.042]  Remember, my books and videos and other documentaries and books that we carry at the Infowars.com video and bookstores are available.
[00:55:05.402 --> 00:55:12.545]  That's what makes this broadcast possible and the bandwidth and the websites and the webmasters and all we do in this toe-to-toe fight with the globalists.
[00:55:12.925 --> 00:55:14.646]  So be sure and visit Infowars.com.
[00:55:15.259 --> 00:55:20.340]  We're going to PrisonPlanet.tv and get a yearly membership for almost half off for the rest of this month.
[00:55:20.760 --> 00:55:24.221]  We're getting a monthly membership for $5.95 at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:55:25.441 --> 00:55:28.422]  Let's go ahead and talk to Robert.
[00:55:28.562 --> 00:55:29.662]  Robert, where are you calling us from?
[00:55:29.682 --> 00:55:30.702]  Hi, Alex.
[00:55:30.802 --> 00:55:31.942]  I'm Robert in San Diego.
[00:55:31.962 --> 00:55:32.202]  Welcome.
[00:55:32.443 --> 00:55:35.143]  I've spoken a few times this week because I've been off for a spring break.
[00:55:35.283 --> 00:55:35.463]  Sure.
[00:55:35.503 --> 00:55:36.063]  What's on your mind?
[00:55:36.163 --> 00:55:38.444]  I'm so excited to be a part of what you've done this week.
[00:55:38.484 --> 00:55:44.425]  I mean, that was a brilliant, covert maneuver on your part to bring out Charlie Sheen with no further warning.
[00:55:45.215 --> 00:55:47.016]  And let him say his feel.
[00:55:47.797 --> 00:55:50.859]  I just felt like it was a privilege to be there at a historic moment.
[00:55:51.479 --> 00:55:55.122]  I know you know Gary Busey and Mel Gibson and Billy Crystal, Gene Wilder.
[00:55:55.142 --> 00:55:59.084]  I know these guys would like back him up, and I hope they come out this week and do so.
[00:56:01.366 --> 00:56:08.891]  Well, Mel Gibson's down in southern Mexico filming his amazing new film that's going to be coming out in a while.
[00:56:08.951 --> 00:56:09.712]  I can't wait to see.
[00:56:09.772 --> 00:56:14.735]  But, yeah, there's a lot of people that are aware of what's going on, and I do challenge them to speak up and step up.
[00:56:15.339 --> 00:56:16.100]  Well, this was really big.
[00:56:16.120 --> 00:56:21.283]  What got me to call was, I know you know Michael Savage, the radio guy, right?
[00:56:21.743 --> 00:56:22.064]  Wiener?
[00:56:22.544 --> 00:56:22.684]  Yes.
[00:56:22.784 --> 00:56:24.826]  And who comes on after him is Jerry Doyle.
[00:56:25.066 --> 00:56:29.028]  And for three hours, Jerry Doyle totally trashed Charlie Sheen.
[00:56:29.089 --> 00:56:32.431]  I was just like, oh, man, they have called out every gun.
[00:56:33.346 --> 00:56:43.533]  They're all a bunch of old, dirty, hippie beatniks who couldn't take down this country in the 60s, so the wolves changed into sheep's clothing.
[00:56:43.573 --> 00:56:45.874]  I mean, literally, research, savage folks.
[00:56:46.375 --> 00:56:48.016]  A king daddy beatnik.
[00:56:48.096 --> 00:56:49.236]  A hippie controller.
[00:56:49.817 --> 00:56:54.080]  An anti-American slab of maggot meat.
[00:56:55.380 --> 00:57:00.524]  Well, George Clooney said that at the Oscars, they were the one crowd that would point a spotlight on
[00:57:01.288 --> 00:57:01.568]  Thank you.
[00:57:14.093 --> 00:57:14.593]  So they did.
[00:57:14.693 --> 00:57:21.776]  I think they were immediately attacking it, and somebody was listening, you know, as soon as you put Charlie Sheen on, because, man, the waves instantly started blowing.
[00:57:21.996 --> 00:57:23.296]  Sir, there's no debating that.
[00:57:23.456 --> 00:57:25.377]  Do you know what happened that day?
[00:57:25.437 --> 00:57:37.201]  Both servers in Chicago and California were hit, and both the server outfits sent us back, you know, reports saying, yeah, I forget the exact code for it, but it's a flood attack.
[00:57:38.010 --> 00:57:41.112]  And that's the only time, and I've been listening for almost four years now of mine.
[00:57:41.292 --> 00:57:45.734]  Listen, we had not announced Sheen was coming on air 30 minutes before he came on and the attack began.
[00:57:46.554 --> 00:57:46.834]  Whoa.
[00:57:46.855 --> 00:57:49.636]  Oh, well, of course you're already bugged.
[00:57:49.716 --> 00:57:50.236]  Oh, of course.
[00:57:50.716 --> 00:57:51.697]  Everything's listening to him.
[00:57:51.797 --> 00:57:54.078]  The Boston Herald that you talked about.
[00:57:54.098 --> 00:57:59.161]  Can you imagine I never get to have a conversation with my grandma without these people listening?
[00:57:59.741 --> 00:58:01.002]  This is the freedom of this country.
[00:58:01.222 --> 00:58:02.242]  But it's fine.
[00:58:02.422 --> 00:58:04.923]  I'm good, they're bad, and fine.
[00:58:04.943 --> 00:58:05.824]  They'll get an education.
[00:58:06.445 --> 00:58:06.925]  I was going to say that.
[00:58:06.945 --> 00:58:08.707]  You're just going to have to teach them how to talk properly.
[00:58:08.727 --> 00:58:10.729]  Yeah, I talk to them sometimes.
[00:58:10.769 --> 00:58:11.329]  I say hi to them.
[00:58:11.690 --> 00:58:20.838]  But the tribe.net political junkies website, they did an awesome story on you and included the Infowars and the Prison Planet website address.
[00:58:21.235 --> 00:58:22.156]  Thanks for all you do.
[00:58:22.416 --> 00:58:27.040]  It was a great spring break, and now we're going to kick their butt with all these Hollywood superstars coming on board.
[00:58:27.200 --> 00:58:27.720]  Thanks, Alex.
[00:58:27.740 --> 00:58:30.222]  So what else happened with the twit attacking?
[00:58:30.302 --> 00:58:31.323]  I heard they're all attacking.
[00:58:31.383 --> 00:58:32.344]  Oh, it was embarrassing.
[00:58:32.384 --> 00:58:39.209]  He said that he was involved personally, that Charlie Sheen's father called Terry Doyle, and they went over there to do an intervention on him.
[00:58:39.670 --> 00:58:40.711]  Stay there.
[00:58:41.111 --> 00:58:46.015]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-300-7645.
[00:58:51.325 --> 00:58:51.705]  Hello!
[00:58:57.888 --> 00:58:58.528]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.208 --> 00:59:00.289]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.969 --> 00:59:02.110]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.730 --> 00:59:03.550]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.291 --> 00:59:05.211]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.231 --> 00:59:09.613]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.033 --> 00:59:14.175]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:16.276 --> 00:59:20.778]  Right now to the second hour, expert on the New World Order on government-sponsored terror,
[00:59:21.480 --> 00:59:27.644]  Webster Griffin Tarpley, author of 9-1-1 Synthetic Terror, Made in the USA, joining us coming up in the next segment.
[00:59:27.664 --> 00:59:38.912]  Then Charlie Sheen is scheduled in the last 30 minutes of this hour to respond to all the great folks out there that are supporting him and to respond to the scumbag neocon dirtbag hippies.
[00:59:39.711 --> 00:59:40.952]  Who call themselves conservatives.
[00:59:41.392 --> 00:59:43.514]  And that's really, their leadership's a bunch of scum.
[00:59:43.874 --> 00:59:44.815]  Go track them back.
[00:59:45.815 --> 00:59:50.559]  The globalists couldn't take us down in the 60s, so now they're posing as conservatives, which is not going to work.
[00:59:50.899 --> 00:59:53.821]  The coalition of American people that love freedom are going to be defeated.
[00:59:55.142 --> 01:00:01.766]  Now, by the way, the CNN poll that's got tens and tens of thousands of respondents, he's now at 83%.
[01:00:03.547 --> 01:00:05.689]  It's marching upwards.
[01:00:06.209 --> 01:00:10.592]  They'll probably close the poll in the next few hours, so go to Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:00:10.972 --> 01:00:21.679]  Top story is about the poll, and you can read about that and link through to the poll, and vote on whether you agree with Charlie Sheen about government involvement or government cover-up of 9-11, or if you agree with now the 17% of people.
[01:00:23.780 --> 01:00:39.492]  Or I guess it would be 16% of people that agree with the official line and also the people who, again, believe in mermaids and people who believe in unicorns and they also believe in hobgoblins and Bugs Bunny.
[01:00:40.573 --> 01:00:41.874]  And they believe in WMDs.
[01:00:41.914 --> 01:00:45.997]  They still believe WMDs were found and they believe in a fantasy world.
[01:00:46.017 --> 01:00:52.261]  They believe George Bush is a conservative and not a gun-grabbing, open-border-promoting, New World Order puppet of the globalists.
[01:00:54.266 --> 01:00:56.206]  Let's go ahead and go back to your calls.
[01:00:56.226 --> 01:00:57.147]  Get a few calls in here.
[01:00:57.227 --> 01:00:58.647]  Tim in Nebraska.
[01:00:58.947 --> 01:00:59.887]  You're on the air, Tim.
[01:00:59.927 --> 01:01:00.407]  Go ahead.
[01:01:00.427 --> 01:01:01.527]  Hey, Alex.
[01:01:01.927 --> 01:01:10.149]  I'd just like to tell a new world order right now that if anything happens to you, your name will become a battle cry like remember the Alamo.
[01:01:11.289 --> 01:01:12.689]  So you don't have to worry about that.
[01:01:14.089 --> 01:01:23.051]  And anyway, what I called in about, I'd just like to hear you maybe comment a little about this is great that this can of worms is open now.
[01:01:23.959 --> 01:01:27.863]  But I'm afraid it's going to get blamed on the wrong people.
[01:01:27.923 --> 01:01:33.830]  I hope when you get on your forum tonight that you can plant some seeds about the New World Order.
[01:01:35.752 --> 01:01:39.797]  Well, I think I... Sure, I said military industrial complex and global is the same thing.
[01:01:40.257 --> 01:01:40.497]  Yeah.
[01:01:40.778 --> 01:01:43.961]  But no... Let's keep beating that drum, you know.
[01:01:44.181 --> 01:01:45.443]  Well, I'll be on showbiz tonight.
[01:01:46.278 --> 01:01:51.702]  On the CNN Headline News live at 7 o'clock Eastern, 6 o'clock Central, and then it re-airs later.
[01:01:52.223 --> 01:01:53.343]  And one question for you.
[01:01:53.363 --> 01:01:58.927]  What was that governor's name that went to the Bilderberger meeting?
[01:01:59.008 --> 01:02:01.269]  Richards went last year.
[01:02:01.289 --> 01:02:02.610]  What state was he from?
[01:02:02.710 --> 01:02:03.991]  Bill Richards, New Mexico.
[01:02:04.011 --> 01:02:06.373]  Okay.
[01:02:07.053 --> 01:02:07.514]  That's all.
[01:02:08.174 --> 01:02:08.454]  All right.
[01:02:08.495 --> 01:02:08.775]  Good to...
[01:02:09.511 --> 01:02:10.231]  Good to hear from you.
[01:02:10.932 --> 01:02:16.115]  Let's go ahead and talk to Jason in Maryland, up there at Fort Meade CIA Command Base.
[01:02:16.135 --> 01:02:16.475]  What's up?
[01:02:17.295 --> 01:02:17.655]  Hi, Alex.
[01:02:17.715 --> 01:02:37.746]  I was wondering, with the federal control of New Orleans and the surrounding areas, and Panama, as you've already discussed, and the state that it's in, thanks to Bill Clinton, what are the chances of, do you think, if you considered Russia and China, who worked unprecedented war games to
[01:02:38.638 --> 01:02:39.098]  You know what?
[01:02:39.279 --> 01:02:40.300]  The old-timers always said that.
[01:02:40.320 --> 01:02:47.886]  All these military high-level officers who were in the Pentagon, in the Joint Chiefs, standing behind the officers, standing behind the different chairmen.
[01:02:59.728 --> 01:03:01.409]  The different members said this.
[01:03:01.569 --> 01:03:06.154]  And then over the years, I go to training drills, and the Marines are with foreign troops training to take over America.
[01:03:06.635 --> 01:03:07.575]  And they bring in Dutch.
[01:03:07.595 --> 01:03:08.536]  They bring in Mexican.
[01:03:08.576 --> 01:03:09.437]  They bring in Canadian.
[01:03:09.457 --> 01:03:10.218]  They bring in British.
[01:03:10.558 --> 01:03:11.359]  They bring in Israeli.
[01:03:11.399 --> 01:03:12.320]  I've seen French troops.
[01:03:12.661 --> 01:03:14.983]  And then they have role players saying, I'm an American.
[01:03:15.003 --> 01:03:19.407]  And they're there breaking up the families, breaking up the children from the parents.
[01:03:19.427 --> 01:03:20.989]  They hire hundreds and hundreds of role players.
[01:03:21.449 --> 01:03:22.770]  And I'm sitting here watching this.
[01:03:22.851 --> 01:03:26.134]  Our government's drilling to bring in foreign troops and put us in camps.
[01:03:26.354 --> 01:03:29.377]  And now the Houston Chronicle admits Halliburton's building camps in America.
[01:03:30.077 --> 01:03:30.698]  So, yes.
[01:03:31.358 --> 01:03:33.340]  And you've got to understand, the Bushes funded Hitler.
[01:03:34.081 --> 01:03:41.328]  Prescott was taken into police custody for a short time and fined for being the main Nazi agent in the U.S.
[01:03:41.368 --> 01:03:42.228]  So it's that ilk.
[01:03:42.248 --> 01:03:43.410]  I mean, these guys think big.
[01:03:47.257 --> 01:03:47.937]  I don't want to believe it.
[01:03:47.957 --> 01:03:48.738]  It's so wild.
[01:03:48.758 --> 01:03:51.841]  The communist military is going to run our port security?
[01:03:54.643 --> 01:03:57.486]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[01:03:57.746 --> 01:03:58.446]  Hello, my friends.
[01:03:58.547 --> 01:03:59.327]  Alex Jones here.
[01:03:59.668 --> 01:04:04.352]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law, 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[01:04:04.692 --> 01:04:11.438]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[01:04:11.738 --> 01:04:13.720]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[01:04:13.920 --> 01:04:16.762]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[01:04:16.862 --> 01:04:21.525]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[01:04:21.725 --> 01:04:26.128]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[01:04:26.369 --> 01:04:33.594]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[01:04:33.854 --> 01:04:36.276]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.

[01:05:47.125 --> 01:05:49.086]  The United States has been targeted for overthrow for world government.
[01:05:49.287 --> 01:05:54.530]  The United Nations has been established to redistribute the wealth of the world away from the United States, Great Britain, and Western Europe.
[01:06:14.326 --> 01:06:23.093]  You need to know, as a specific individual citizen of the United States of America, why these things are happening and what you can do about it.

[01:06:54.331 --> 01:06:56.553]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:06:56.573 --> 01:06:59.895]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:10.578 --> 01:07:14.381]  Wake up, boys, there's a light at the window.
[01:07:14.401 --> 01:07:20.106]  I can hear someone knocking on the door.
[01:07:21.507 --> 01:07:26.131]  There are voices in the street and the sound of running feet.
[01:07:26.912 --> 01:07:29.854]  And they whisper the word, revolution.
[01:07:32.156 --> 01:07:36.199]  There are men coming down from the valley.
[01:07:37.962 --> 01:07:52.734]  There are tall ships flying off the coast And they carry the light in the dark of the night Like a whisper in the wind Revolution!
[01:07:55.256 --> 01:08:04.803]  Bring my gun and a handful of silver By the sea we will gather for the fight
[01:08:07.191 --> 01:08:23.127]  It's been so many years So many tears We have lost once before Now we'll settle the score When our cannons will roar Revolution!
[01:08:43.541 --> 01:08:44.542]  We're good to go.
[01:09:20.885 --> 01:09:21.686]  We're good to go.
[01:09:50.417 --> 01:09:52.307]  I think.
[01:10:33.587 --> 01:10:35.107]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:10:36.268 --> 01:10:45.110]  Now we are joined by Webster Griffin Tarbley, who wrote back in, I guess, 1991 or so, the unauthorized biography of George Herbert Walker Bush.
[01:10:45.130 --> 01:10:49.010]  And he's now written one of the best books, I think, if not the best, on 9-11.
[01:10:49.030 --> 01:10:52.611]  And his analysis mirrors mine, how they did it, how they carried it out.
[01:10:52.711 --> 01:10:55.592]  And we carry that book at InfoWars.com in the video and bookstore.
[01:10:56.092 --> 01:10:59.893]  And that is 9-1-1 Synthetic Terror, made in the USA.
[01:11:00.962 --> 01:11:06.004]  And, Webster, it is a great honor to have you joining us for the next hour and 20 minutes.
[01:11:06.484 --> 01:11:09.205]  Then we're scheduled to have Charlie Sheen on with us for the last 30 minutes.
[01:11:09.765 --> 01:11:10.766]  Good to have you on board with us.
[01:11:10.946 --> 01:11:12.026]  Thank you very much, Alex.
[01:11:12.106 --> 01:11:14.427]  It's great to be here, and it's been a big week for all of us.
[01:11:14.947 --> 01:11:16.108]  Thanks to you in large part.
[01:11:16.693 --> 01:11:18.434]  Well, really, thanks to Charlie Sheen's courage.
[01:11:19.055 --> 01:11:21.096]  And, you know, the story is he's an American citizen.
[01:11:21.136 --> 01:11:22.277]  He's allowed to have his views.
[01:11:22.717 --> 01:11:32.783]  And the CNN poll is now running 83% agree with him out of, let me click on it, I think it's something like 14,000 respondents.
[01:11:32.803 --> 01:11:40.548]  Let me just click on it and go there and tell people what it's currently saying out of,
[01:11:41.551 --> 01:11:44.893]  Out of a total of 16,150 votes, 13,364, or 83%, agree with Charlie Sheen that the U.S.
[01:11:45.294 --> 01:11:50.337]  government covered up the real events of 9-11 attacks, and only 17% agree with the official fairy tale, 2,786 votes out of 16,150, and that is CNN showbiz.
[01:12:02.825 --> 01:12:06.628]  Well, I think, as Charlie put it, the worm is turning, the dams are breaking.
[01:12:06.648 --> 01:12:09.390]  And maybe I could just comment on what I see is behind this.
[01:12:09.470 --> 01:12:12.172]  Just in the past week, we've had your interview with Charlie Sheen.
[01:12:25.327 --> 01:12:33.555]  We've had the New York Magazine article on the 9-11 truth movement in this lecture series we had going at St.
[01:12:33.595 --> 01:12:35.977]  Mark's in the Bowery Church down in Lower Manhattan.
[01:12:36.438 --> 01:12:42.804]  That was an article which contains a mass of factual material, more than enough to destroy the official version.
[01:12:42.904 --> 01:12:49.510]  There had already been an article in the Village Voice around February 21st about that same lecture series.
[01:12:50.454 --> 01:12:53.217]  Then we've had this Showbiz Tonight program with A.J.
[01:12:53.277 --> 01:12:58.202]  Hammer, which was very, very skeptical and basically rejected the official version.
[01:12:58.242 --> 01:13:01.585]  Now, what I think is going on in the background is something like this.
[01:13:01.625 --> 01:13:04.788]  This is a preliminary assessment, but my best guess at the moment.
[01:13:05.449 --> 01:13:07.671]  I would say that a sector of the U.S.
[01:13:07.751 --> 01:13:10.654]  ruling class, that means some finance oligarchs,
[01:13:11.634 --> 01:13:25.647]  In the Wall Street to London axis, have decided that Bush-Cheney may well be insane and out of control, and that it's time to make these puppets act like the puppets they're supposed to be.
[01:13:26.494 --> 01:13:29.256]  So it's kind of like how they set up Hitler.
[01:13:29.296 --> 01:13:38.284]  They thought he got too big for his britches?
[01:13:38.344 --> 01:13:40.966]  Let me be specific with you, Webster, because I agree with you.
[01:13:40.986 --> 01:13:43.428]  That's what my guts and all the analysis is saying.
[01:13:43.688 --> 01:13:49.373]  So we're on the same page as usual, because we're just looking at the facts here and going off the historical lens.
[01:13:49.933 --> 01:13:56.676]  Do you believe it's a split in the Anglo-American New World Order power bloc, or do you believe it is a split out of the more European elite?
[01:13:56.696 --> 01:14:02.079]  Because we know that split in the European elite from our moles inside Bilderberg Group, that had already emerged.
[01:14:02.119 --> 01:14:14.905]  So do you believe it is a widening split between the European junction with the Anglo-American British-US empire system and the oligarchy, or do you believe it is a split within the Anglo-American establishment itself?
[01:14:15.365 --> 01:14:22.309]  Well, my basic approach to analysis on this stuff is you have Wall Street and you have the city of London, and that's primary.
[01:14:22.429 --> 01:14:25.391]  The rest of them are junior partners if they're lucky.
[01:14:25.471 --> 01:14:31.555]  It basically goes from London to New York, and then the tentacles of New York, of course, are everywhere here.
[01:14:31.575 --> 01:14:37.078]  But still, the old guard elite has a large voting block when they have the syndicate meetings.
[01:14:38.476 --> 01:14:41.799]  Well, again, I don't know if there's a consensus on this.
[01:14:41.839 --> 01:14:43.420]  I would say right now it's a minority.
[01:14:43.440 --> 01:14:47.823]  Well, my consensus is from Bilderberg Intelligence that it's always proven to be spot on.
[01:14:48.483 --> 01:14:54.488]  Well, I think there's at least an active group which is alarmed by the insanity of Bush Cheney.
[01:14:54.968 --> 01:14:57.290]  This remark that Bush made this week that the U.S.
[01:14:57.330 --> 01:15:02.594]  forces will be in Iraq through 2009, I think has appalled a lot of them.
[01:15:02.634 --> 01:15:03.955]  They think that he's insane.
[01:15:04.732 --> 01:15:07.818]  They would look at Iraq and say, we've already got what we want from Iraq.
[01:15:07.838 --> 01:15:10.103]  We have a civil war beginning or going on.
[01:15:10.544 --> 01:15:13.210]  That civil war will divide Iraq into three parts.
[01:15:13.711 --> 01:15:14.553]  What more do we want?
[01:15:14.904 --> 01:15:19.147]  I think they see that Bush has committed the cardinal sin of believing his own propaganda.
[01:15:19.527 --> 01:15:22.449]  All this neocon malarkey about democracy.
[01:15:22.489 --> 01:15:26.031]  Yeah, that's why I use the Hitler analogy, you know, insanely attacking ten countries.
[01:15:26.691 --> 01:15:29.753]  That, and then, of course, the preparations for the attack on Iran.
[01:15:29.773 --> 01:15:31.715]  And I think there are some clearer heads in the system.
[01:15:31.775 --> 01:15:33.275]  I'm not so sure where they are.
[01:15:33.336 --> 01:15:34.536]  How does Israel factor in?
[01:15:34.636 --> 01:15:40.340]  I mean, their defense minister was, just a week and a half ago, calling us names and saying we hadn't done enough for them.
[01:15:40.700 --> 01:15:45.986]  Well, I think the Israelis are rather less important in the scheme of things than they may seem.
[01:15:46.066 --> 01:15:52.292]  I think the Israelis are generally a controlled asset, and even when they're craziest, they're also under control.
[01:15:52.352 --> 01:15:57.738]  I think it's London and New York, and the Israelis certainly an appendage of that with a very loud voice,
[01:15:58.311 --> 01:16:00.392]  But maybe not with as much clout as they think.
[01:16:00.452 --> 01:16:00.852]  No, I know.
[01:16:00.912 --> 01:16:01.692]  It's just AIPAC.
[01:16:01.792 --> 01:16:04.613]  AIPAC is hopping up and down, going absolutely ape right now.
[01:16:04.793 --> 01:16:05.373]  Yes, of course.
[01:16:05.393 --> 01:16:06.453]  They're trying to get out in front.
[01:16:06.753 --> 01:16:12.174]  I think that the oligarchs feel that if the attack on Iran takes place, their system is doomed.
[01:16:12.195 --> 01:16:17.196]  The dollar is doomed, and the system of U.S.-British world domination is going to be doomed.
[01:16:17.256 --> 01:16:20.036]  So what they want to do is get Bush and Cheney back on a leash.
[01:16:20.397 --> 01:16:22.477]  And therefore, what they're doing is brandishing.
[01:16:22.517 --> 01:16:24.538]  They're agitating the red flag of...
[01:16:26.408 --> 01:16:29.731]  Making September 11th into the new Watergate tapes.
[01:16:29.771 --> 01:16:33.655]  Let me just take you back, because this would be... Well, no, Webster, I said this three years ago.
[01:16:33.776 --> 01:16:41.643]  I said there's a certain elite who is allowing us to... that 9-11 was actually done with an escape valve for the higher level elites.
[01:16:42.364 --> 01:16:47.267]  Well, I think what these ruling class circles have in mind is what we would have to call a limited hangout.
[01:16:47.327 --> 01:16:48.547]  In other words, they're not proposing...
[01:17:09.744 --> 01:17:10.885]  To tell the whole truth.
[01:17:10.965 --> 01:17:24.812]  And I think you can see that in the revelations, for example, so far, none of the corporate media is talking about the way in which the 9-11 operations were run through military drills and terror drills in the U.S.
[01:17:25.312 --> 01:17:27.654]  military security bureaucracy.
[01:17:27.694 --> 01:17:30.775]  I think they're going for something more limited.
[01:17:31.776 --> 01:17:32.356]  Let's go back.
[01:17:32.416 --> 01:17:32.716]  July 13, 1973.
[01:17:34.657 --> 01:17:37.579]  Alexander Butterfield, deputy assistant to Nixon...
[01:17:38.041 --> 01:17:42.584]  Tells the Watergate Investigating Committee there's a taping system in the White House.
[01:17:42.984 --> 01:17:44.785]  So Butterfield is the one who reveals it.
[01:17:45.246 --> 01:17:53.611]  I think what these ruling class circles are considering right now is using September 11th as an equivalent of the Watergate tapes.
[01:17:54.111 --> 01:17:56.373]  So we have to look now on the horizon.
[01:17:56.473 --> 01:17:58.955]  Is there a Butterfield about to come forward?
[01:17:59.055 --> 01:18:01.976]  Is there a Deep Throat about to come forward?
[01:18:02.497 --> 01:18:06.299]  I have been looking closely at the Musawi trial in Alexandria, Virginia.
[01:18:06.359 --> 01:18:07.320]  That is a possible...
[01:18:08.417 --> 01:18:16.963]  Because we're now learning that the FBI agents are going, we told you 75 times he was going to do this, and you told us to stand down.
[01:18:17.724 --> 01:18:18.124]  Absolutely.
[01:18:18.144 --> 01:18:24.770]  So really what's coming out now in America is W1999, which these neocons denied existed even when the BBC admitted it.
[01:18:25.450 --> 01:18:36.239]  Well, I think what you see in the Alexandria trial is simply the stubborn refusal of the moles in the FBI to arrest the Patsys, Moussaoui and his circles,
[01:18:36.926 --> 01:18:37.326]  Exactly.
[01:18:37.447 --> 01:18:39.588]  And then if you burn moles, moles won't work for you.
[01:18:39.608 --> 01:18:40.769]  We'll be right back.
[01:18:40.829 --> 01:18:43.732]  Do you know the truth about breast cancer?
[01:18:43.752 --> 01:18:46.234]  Did you know that the race for the cure is over?
[01:19:01.089 --> 01:19:08.971]  The best kept secret in the country today is that it is now possible to kill cancer without personal suffering, mutilation, and poisoning of your entire system.
[01:19:09.192 --> 01:19:11.832]  Now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaysMed, Inc.'
[01:19:11.812 --> 01:19:13.213]  's patented methodology.

[01:19:56.735 --> 01:20:02.219]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[01:20:02.779 --> 01:20:03.280]  That's right.
[01:20:03.600 --> 01:20:05.882]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[01:20:06.442 --> 01:20:13.367]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.

[01:23:32.944 --> 01:23:35.465]  Webster, please continue.
[01:23:35.745 --> 01:23:37.766]  But I want to get your take on this right now.
[01:23:38.854 --> 01:23:38.994]  I think.
[01:23:39.014 --> 01:23:39.154]  I think.
[01:23:58.579 --> 01:24:12.496]  Well, you have to look at a totalitarian system like the one in East Germany under communist rule, and you'll see that even under the most pervasive, open, blatant, brutal totalitarianism, you can mount a resistance.
[01:24:12.576 --> 01:24:15.739]  And in this country, there are still ample means of doing it.
[01:24:16.742 --> 01:24:19.684]  I think people are more frightened than they need to be.
[01:24:19.744 --> 01:24:21.805]  They need to be more active and less frightened.
[01:24:22.306 --> 01:24:24.627]  And you will find that you can do a great deal.
[01:24:24.947 --> 01:24:37.775]  And indeed, this current system is based primarily on apathy, passivity, people not voting, not agitating, not demonstrating, not telling their congressmen, you know, reading the Riot Act.
[01:24:38.283 --> 01:24:38.843]  And so forth.
[01:24:38.863 --> 01:24:41.325]  So I think it's time for great activism right now.
[01:24:41.485 --> 01:24:49.190]  Well, I know you want to get into all the details of what you think is going on and 9-11 and talk more about the scene situation, but this is a short segment.
[01:24:50.090 --> 01:24:52.172]  I want you to give us your forecast.
[01:24:52.552 --> 01:24:55.554]  What do you think is going to happen in the next month, the next six months, the next year?
[01:24:56.114 --> 01:25:10.322]  I'm hoping that out of this Moussaoui trial, we've had the prosecution phase, we still have the defense phase of the Moussaoui trial, which is absolutely wild because the man is, of course, a psychotic patsy and he doesn't know what he's doing, but he may be used.
[01:25:10.403 --> 01:25:12.844]  Somebody may put something in front of him and he may just read it.
[01:25:13.762 --> 01:25:28.631]  Again, for some kind of a version of the Watergate tapes, but this time on September 11th to emerge, or a deep throat on September 11th to emerge and blow the lid off the issue in the way that happened in the spring of 1973 vis-a-vis Watergate.
[01:25:28.991 --> 01:25:41.399]  The task of all of us is to make sure that these revelations don't just involve some people in the FBI or the puppets Cheney and Bush, but rather go right to the heart of the matter, which is that invisible government
[01:25:41.798 --> 01:25:44.540]  What did you think of the job I did last night?
[01:25:44.560 --> 01:25:48.962]  What more would you have added if you'd have had that chance at six minutes live?
[01:25:58.900 --> 01:26:01.942]  Well, I think it was a good performance.
[01:26:02.803 --> 01:26:12.270]  I think it's just a matter of quantity at this point and multiplying the news outlets from which this stuff is going to be emerging.
[01:26:12.810 --> 01:26:13.591]  Here's the problem.
[01:26:14.711 --> 01:26:28.856]  They give us a false victory, remove Bush or whatever, for some other corruption issue, and then he steps aside, and then we get a Governor Warner from Virginia, or we get a Hillary Clinton, and I mean, they're exactly the same.
[01:26:29.969 --> 01:26:33.972]  Yes, I would in particular, I would warn people on the Democratic side.
[01:26:33.993 --> 01:26:38.136]  If you look at Hillary Clinton, she is an odious warmonger.
[01:26:38.296 --> 01:26:50.587]  She is basically trying to sell herself that she is a bigger and better warmonger than Bush Cheney, that she can bring European troops, foreign money, wage war in more countries, and I think this is just appalling.
[01:26:51.494 --> 01:26:54.397]  It's clear to me that one of the two major parties must go.
[01:26:54.718 --> 01:27:07.352]  One of them has got to collapse, and I think the good news is that if one of them collapses, the other one will collapse too, because the only reason to vote Republican is because of the horrors of the Democrats, and the only reason to vote for the Democrats is because of the horrors...
[01:27:07.692 --> 01:27:08.452]  Of the Republicans.
[01:27:08.672 --> 01:27:24.135]  Why is Bush doing things that are politically suicidal, like now on the heels of the UAE deal, something that dwarfs it, letting a known communist Chinese military company, and that's admitted, take over port security in the Bahamas with no U.S.
[01:27:24.215 --> 01:27:24.635]  oversight?
[01:27:24.935 --> 01:27:29.996]  Remember that Bush is a liberal Republican banker born in a bank, in effect.
[01:27:30.036 --> 01:27:32.837]  This is a Wall Street family transplanted into...
[01:27:33.377 --> 01:27:34.278]  into Texas, right?
[01:27:34.318 --> 01:27:37.899]  His father was mocked as the Connecticut candidate when he ran for Senate.
[01:27:37.919 --> 01:27:39.820]  He's a horrible, horrible weed, yes.
[01:27:40.181 --> 01:27:43.582]  So, they believe, they have a funny plan.
[01:27:43.622 --> 01:27:50.526]  They say, we want to have the war of civilizations, hatred of Muslims, hatred of Islam, we want to have xenophobia, and we want to have
[01:27:50.905 --> 01:27:56.748]  The absolute supremacy of cosmopolitan finance capital that runs all over the world and has the race to the bottom.
[01:27:56.768 --> 01:28:01.170]  And they love the emir of Dubai because he's a degenerate just like them.
[01:28:01.630 --> 01:28:05.152]  Remember that Dubai is one of the centers of sex slavery in the world.
[01:28:05.212 --> 01:28:06.333]  No, I know.
[01:28:06.533 --> 01:28:11.535]  That's where all these women, and we're talking millions, UN's own numbers, are taken.
[01:28:11.956 --> 01:28:17.478]  And if you say the government of Dubai, you're essentially saying the degenerate family of the emir.
[01:28:17.779 --> 01:28:20.060]  The previous emir just died in Australia at a...
[01:28:20.800 --> 01:28:25.063]  At a racetrack meeting, and the son has now inherited the government.
[01:28:25.083 --> 01:28:26.044]  So they are the government.
[01:28:27.745 --> 01:28:33.809]  I don't think people realize they have huge harems filled with slaves, many of them children, chained.
[01:28:33.829 --> 01:28:34.970]  I mean, this is admitted.
[01:28:35.971 --> 01:28:37.732]  And our government sells them to them.
[01:28:38.453 --> 01:28:39.313]  Right out of Bosnia.
[01:28:39.994 --> 01:28:40.534]  Be right back.
[01:28:43.977 --> 01:28:44.897]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.358 --> 01:28:46.859]  The empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.851 --> 01:28:50.613]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:54.495 --> 01:28:56.856]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here with an important question.
[01:28:57.096 --> 01:28:59.138]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[01:28:59.278 --> 01:29:06.422]  I mean real hard to find all natural pure soap that contains no dyes, perfumes, deodorants, detergents, or other dangerous toxins.
[01:29:06.582 --> 01:29:15.187]  The Calvin Pure Soap Company, for the past 57 years, has been making triple concentrated pure soaps exclusively for healthcare professionals and hospitals.

[01:29:53.883 --> 01:29:55.844]  You've asked for them, and now they're here.
[01:29:55.924 --> 01:29:56.584]  Hello, folks.
[01:29:56.724 --> 01:30:06.649]  Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Lights Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[01:30:07.009 --> 01:30:11.531]  The Berkey's PF2s simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Element.
[01:30:11.611 --> 01:30:22.937]  When used, water flows through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[01:30:23.537 --> 01:30:30.382]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements, where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[01:30:30.762 --> 01:30:32.903]  Your purified water is now ready.
[01:30:33.404 --> 01:30:38.367]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 host filter elements.
[01:30:38.667 --> 01:30:44.977]  Get a set of two for only $49, or get two sets for only $89 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[01:30:54.904 --> 01:30:58.026]  We understand that decisions related to health can be overwhelming.
[01:30:58.286 --> 01:31:05.090]  That is why at ResearchedHerbs.com we take pride in offering you herbs whose safety and effectiveness have been proven time and time again.
[01:31:05.530 --> 01:31:18.878]  For example, did you know that Live52, the top-selling natural herbal supplement for liver diseases since 1930, is backed by over 300 research studies and clinical trials and prescribed by more than 200,000 health professionals worldwide?
[01:31:19.198 --> 01:31:22.940]  In fact, the effectiveness of all the herbs featured on ResearchedHerbs.com
[01:31:23.291 --> 01:31:23.571]  Thank you.
[01:31:53.850 --> 01:31:55.233]  We're good to go.
[01:32:23.993 --> 01:32:24.753]  All right, welcome back.
[01:32:24.773 --> 01:32:25.974]  We're talking to Webster Tarpley.
[01:32:25.994 --> 01:32:32.976]  And Webster, I want to go through some calls, and then we've got plenty of time with you to go back into your analysis of 9-11 and talk about your book, 9-11, Synthetic Terror.
[01:32:33.816 --> 01:32:38.638]  But Dylan Avery, the filmmaker, and we carry his film as well, Loose Change, Second Edition, is just excellent.
[01:32:38.658 --> 01:32:41.299]  It's available at InfoWars.com, and also you can watch it
[01:32:42.088 --> 01:32:50.311]  If you're a PrisonPlanet.tv member, online at high quality bandwidth or low bandwidth for dial-up, whatever you need, right there at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:32:50.331 --> 01:32:54.212]  We're running a special right now where you get almost half a year, 5.3 months free.
[01:32:56.585 --> 01:32:59.607]  Over five months free when you get a yearly membership.
[01:32:59.627 --> 01:33:02.589]  So you pay for a little more than six months, you get over five months free.
[01:33:03.030 --> 01:33:06.852]  Or go get a monthly membership and try it out, 595prisonplanet.tv.
[01:33:06.872 --> 01:33:09.995]  And that special ends in just, I guess, about six days.
[01:33:10.435 --> 01:33:13.017]  Right now, let's go ahead and go to Dylan Avery.
[01:33:13.037 --> 01:33:15.398]  Dylan, you're gracing us with a phone call.
[01:33:15.418 --> 01:33:15.939]  What's on your mind?
[01:33:16.399 --> 01:33:21.122]  Well, Alex, I was listening to your show, and you were doing a discussion about people getting killed for the truth.
[01:33:21.162 --> 01:33:26.026]  And I read earlier this morning that one of the scholars, Michael Zabor, got shot in the head twice last night.
[01:33:27.023 --> 01:33:30.345]  Yeah, I saw that, but he wasn't very high level, though.
[01:33:30.365 --> 01:33:31.826]  I mean, he was a student, correct?
[01:33:32.467 --> 01:33:34.468]  Yeah, he was a student, but he was still a member.
[01:33:34.508 --> 01:33:39.592]  It's just I was reading up on some of the circumstances surrounding his death, and it just seems like another Hunter S. Thompson to me.
[01:33:40.773 --> 01:33:42.994]  Well, give us the details.
[01:33:43.014 --> 01:33:45.276]  I actually have it here in the stack, but why don't you give us the details?
[01:33:45.936 --> 01:33:51.620]  Basically, I believe he was leaving dinner with, what was it, his grandmother and two other friends of his.
[01:33:52.481 --> 01:33:53.782]  They were approached by two men.
[01:33:54.352 --> 01:33:56.373]  Who, you know, mugged him, asked him for his wallet.
[01:33:58.694 --> 01:34:03.576]  Oh, yeah, they took his grandmother's purse from him, and he didn't object, you know, didn't put up a fight or anything.
[01:34:04.017 --> 01:34:07.038]  And then one of the guys shot him in the head twice, and they both ran away.
[01:34:07.658 --> 01:34:16.102]  I mean, two muggers approach a group of four, the guy hands over the purse, no question, and they just shoot the one guy in the head twice for no reason and run away.
[01:34:16.162 --> 01:34:19.364]  Was this guy, because from what I read, I actually have the report right here.
[01:34:19.404 --> 01:34:20.164]  Let me just pull it up.
[01:34:20.184 --> 01:34:23.626]  Let me just go to it.
[01:34:24.802 --> 01:34:32.706]  It says, Scholars for 911 Truth, and I guess this article just details what Scholars for 911 Truth does.
[01:34:32.726 --> 01:34:38.769]  Let me go to the WCCO-TV news piece on this, and it's loading right now.
[01:34:38.849 --> 01:34:39.609]  Excuse me, folks.
[01:34:40.050 --> 01:34:49.935]  It says, A man shot in the head in the uptown area of Minneapolis on Saturday night died late Sunday night at the Hennepin County Medical Center.
[01:34:50.035 --> 01:34:52.496]  Michael Zuber, am I pronouncing that right?
[01:34:53.997 --> 01:34:58.279]  25, was a PhD student at Clemson University in South Carolina.
[01:34:58.339 --> 01:35:01.280]  He was enrolled in the bioengineering program.
[01:35:01.300 --> 01:35:02.441]  Oh, he's a bioengineer.
[01:35:03.181 --> 01:35:04.422]  That's who they've been killing.
[01:35:04.442 --> 01:35:05.742]  Yeah, see, he's a bioengineer.
[01:35:05.782 --> 01:35:06.422]  That's the other thing.
[01:35:06.482 --> 01:35:09.404]  Yeah, yeah, he dreamed of working at NASA someday.
[01:35:09.864 --> 01:35:10.885]  We're good to go.
[01:35:30.931 --> 01:35:37.415]  He was shot in the head at the 3100 block of Garrard Avenue south around 10 p.m.
[01:35:37.615 --> 01:35:38.175]  Saturday.
[01:35:38.195 --> 01:35:40.737]  So we're just now learning about this five days later.
[01:35:41.057 --> 01:35:46.600]  Police said he was walking to a parked car with family members when robbers approached them and demanded his mother's purse.
[01:35:47.040 --> 01:35:49.061]  She gave it to the gunman without any resistance.
[01:35:49.121 --> 01:35:50.982]  One of the men then shot him in the head.
[01:35:51.482 --> 01:36:02.108]  It says Lieutenant Lewis Edwards of the Minneapolis Police Department said within half an hour of the incident, we had already had six homicide investigators and six officers with homicide experience already working this thing.
[01:36:02.428 --> 01:36:08.331]  Police tried to reassure the community on Tuesday that the crime would not go unpunished.
[01:36:08.371 --> 01:36:09.192]  Continue with your comments.
[01:36:10.812 --> 01:36:11.893]  No, you pretty much summed it up.
[01:36:13.422 --> 01:36:18.063]  Again, I wanted to call and touch upon it, because I read that and it was kind of shocking.
[01:36:18.103 --> 01:36:25.926]  He was still a member of the Scholars of the 9-11 Truth, and if anybody wanted to send a message to them, knocking off someone like David Ray Griffin would be a little bit too obvious.
[01:36:26.346 --> 01:36:30.727]  I'm not saying that it is connected, but I just think it's a little bit interesting.
[01:36:30.867 --> 01:36:32.527]  I think it's 50-50 right now.
[01:36:32.608 --> 01:36:35.708]  I've said many times that if they kill me, it'll be a carjacking or a mugging.
[01:36:36.589 --> 01:36:41.390]  Or they'll find my dead body and claim I committed suicide.
[01:36:42.951 --> 01:36:47.094]  And, you know, they'd have some whore on scene to claim, you know, that I was in there with her.
[01:36:48.155 --> 01:36:51.797]  Or they'll, you know, run me over with a truck when I'm not paying attention.
[01:36:52.338 --> 01:36:53.499]  That's the way they do it.
[01:36:54.319 --> 01:37:02.485]  But at the same time, every day in this country, almost every hour, every few hours, somebody gets stabbed or mugged or shot with these crackheads.
[01:37:03.146 --> 01:37:06.208]  We'll just routinely take what you got and then just blow your head off.
[01:37:06.228 --> 01:37:09.009]  I mean, we've all seen it where they're robbing liquor stores on surveillance camera.
[01:37:09.290 --> 01:37:15.373]  The person gives them the money, and then they just are so hopped up and so nuts, they go ahead and pump a few rounds into them.
[01:37:15.853 --> 01:37:22.677]  So I'd say 50-50, and the point you bring up is exactly what I was thinking, a way to send a message and then probably try to scare everybody.
[01:37:22.697 --> 01:37:25.799]  But, you know, they can't kill us all, and we'll continue to watch this.
[01:37:25.839 --> 01:37:26.679]  Thanks, Dylan, for the call.
[01:37:27.960 --> 01:37:28.580]  You still there, Dylan?
[01:37:29.001 --> 01:37:29.461]  Yeah, I'm still here.
[01:37:30.813 --> 01:37:36.808]  I myself am a member of the 9-11 Scholars and the 9-11 Scholars held a press conference
[01:37:38.034 --> 01:37:51.340]  A week ago, Tuesday it must have been, at the Musawi trial in Alexandria, Virginia, and we had Jim Fetzer from Minnesota, and we had Phil Berg, who's running the RICO suit against Bush Cheney.
[01:37:51.380 --> 01:37:54.842]  He's the former Deputy Attorney General of what state is it?
[01:37:54.862 --> 01:37:55.743]  Pennsylvania, yes.
[01:37:55.803 --> 01:37:58.984]  He's the former candidate for Governor and Senate in Pennsylvania.
[01:37:59.024 --> 01:38:04.747]  So he's representing William Rodriguez, the Puerto Rican janitor who had been the...
[01:38:05.888 --> 01:38:08.144]  The hero of the North Power saving people,
[01:38:08.812 --> 01:38:14.876]  So that was a press conference that took place with guards toting machine guns all around.
[01:38:14.916 --> 01:38:16.077]  You couldn't put up a sign.
[01:38:16.517 --> 01:38:18.058]  There were all sorts of things you couldn't do.
[01:38:18.738 --> 01:38:35.269]  I think that this killing, which I just learned about right now, is extremely suspicious, and it does merit a call to Attorney General Gonzalez and the FBI to do something about this, because this looks to me like domestic terrorism.
[01:38:35.329 --> 01:38:36.129]  Well, here's the deal.
[01:38:36.249 --> 01:38:36.870]  I'm reading it.
[01:38:37.702 --> 01:38:39.463]  And they're not filing witness reports.
[01:38:39.483 --> 01:38:41.044]  They're not telling us what they look like.
[01:38:41.544 --> 01:38:43.785]  Normally, you'd know that in 10 minutes after it happened.
[01:38:43.805 --> 01:38:47.206]  So it's very suspicious that the police aren't giving out details.
[01:38:47.286 --> 01:38:48.067]  That stinks.
[01:38:48.487 --> 01:38:49.908]  I think it's extremely suspicious.
[01:38:50.108 --> 01:38:53.229]  And I would urge people, however, don't be terrified.
[01:38:53.269 --> 01:38:53.889]  Be angry.
[01:38:54.390 --> 01:38:57.151]  And let that be another spur to more and more activism.
[01:38:58.311 --> 01:39:00.512]  Because the purpose of terrorism, of course, is terror.
[01:39:00.613 --> 01:39:03.614]  It's designed to put you into a passive... That's what they do in Iraq.
[01:39:04.460 --> 01:39:04.860]  Pardon me?
[01:39:05.320 --> 01:39:06.761]  They have death squads all over Iraq.
[01:39:06.841 --> 01:39:07.381]  Absolutely.
[01:39:07.481 --> 01:39:11.743]  Right by the former death squad mothership, Negroponte, who now is head of all U.S.
[01:39:11.783 --> 01:39:12.223]  intelligence.
[01:39:12.844 --> 01:39:13.424]  That's correct.
[01:39:13.664 --> 01:39:16.065]  So I think that's a very serious matter.
[01:39:16.125 --> 01:39:17.626]  And, of course, his organs were donated.
[01:39:17.926 --> 01:39:22.848]  You know, I'm sitting here reading this, and we need to call the Minneapolis Police Department, 612-692-8477.
[01:39:22.868 --> 01:39:25.309]  Our network is based up there.
[01:39:25.429 --> 01:39:26.089]  I'm down here in Austin.
[01:39:26.109 --> 01:39:26.369]  And we need...
[01:39:33.283 --> 01:39:34.704]  I was just talking about this earlier, you know.
[01:39:34.844 --> 01:39:38.947]  We need to demand of the police, hey, you give us the descriptions.
[01:39:39.248 --> 01:39:42.430]  Why haven't you given us the descriptions of his mother and others that saw this?
[01:39:42.750 --> 01:39:44.171]  That is incredible!
[01:39:45.012 --> 01:39:51.037]  There should have been a description out on the radio and on TV within minutes of this, and if it's a normal murder, that happens.
[01:39:51.277 --> 01:39:52.558]  This is very suspicious.
[01:39:55.380 --> 01:39:59.183]  I think there's obviously a strong suspicion that it's a political assassination...
[01:40:00.078 --> 01:40:01.038]  By the other side.
[01:40:01.098 --> 01:40:16.503]  In other words, I think it's a feature of warfare in the ruling class with people more at our level who are expected to pay the price as these ruling class factions battle it out to see whether the truth on 9-11 is going to come out or not.
[01:40:18.644 --> 01:40:25.446]  Well, I'm telling you, the fact here that they're not even days after it, they're not telling us, we've got to find out.
[01:40:25.486 --> 01:40:27.007]  Hey, guys at the network, you're up there.
[01:40:27.067 --> 01:40:28.167]  Scan all your local news.
[01:40:29.040 --> 01:40:35.022]  Just type in man shot uptown, police description of perpetrators.
[01:40:35.262 --> 01:40:36.183]  I'll try to search it out.
[01:40:36.783 --> 01:40:39.124]  And the rest of my people in there, get on it, find out.
[01:40:39.404 --> 01:40:40.344]  Thank you, Dylan, for the call.
[01:40:40.364 --> 01:40:42.685]  I appreciate it, Dylan Avery.
[01:40:44.726 --> 01:40:47.687]  Webster, I'll tell you, everything gets weirder and weirder by the minute.
[01:40:49.346 --> 01:41:00.571]  Well, as I say, it's clear that one faction of the ruling elite wants to at least submit Bush and Cheney to oligarchical consensus control.
[01:41:00.631 --> 01:41:09.055]  That would mean moves towards liquidating the adventure in Iraq, cooling off the business with Iran.
[01:41:09.475 --> 01:41:11.396]  It's also a factor of the dollar.
[01:41:11.456 --> 01:41:16.118]  If you look at Nixon and Watergate, you'll see that the fall of Nixon in 1974 has everything to do
[01:41:17.952 --> 01:41:19.093]  With the fall of the U.S.
[01:41:19.153 --> 01:41:25.399]  dollar in August 15, 1971, in other words, the breakup of the Bretton Woods monetary system.
[01:41:25.579 --> 01:41:38.590]  The breakup of Bretton Woods is a relatively mild event compared to the dollar panic, flight from the dollar, death agony of the imperial dollar that we're living through right now with a whole series of things going on.
[01:41:38.610 --> 01:41:42.374]  Let me just go back and say about this poor man that got killed, at least it was quick.
[01:41:43.596 --> 01:41:49.240]  And I tell you, that concerns me, Webster, that your gut-level instinct is that killing.
[01:41:49.580 --> 01:41:52.241]  And reading more about this, it is very suspicious.
[01:41:52.261 --> 01:41:55.323]  Yes, it's absolutely.
[01:41:55.383 --> 01:42:03.889]  Now we want to see whether we have a government of laws or whether we have a government of political factions fighting over their spoils.
[01:42:04.709 --> 01:42:10.213]  And obviously, it looks like you'd have to assume that there's an interstate element in it.
[01:42:10.233 --> 01:42:11.273]  So where is Gonzalez?
[01:42:11.353 --> 01:42:12.214]  Where is the FBI?
[01:42:16.089 --> 01:42:21.211]  So you guys have a press conference, and a day later, one of the members of the group... I wouldn't say a day later.
[01:42:21.251 --> 01:42:24.952]  I think the press conference was a week ago Tuesday, as I recall.
[01:42:25.072 --> 01:42:27.633]  Okay, so a few days later, and then this guy gets blasted.
[01:42:27.713 --> 01:42:34.755]  At the federal court in Alexandria, and there was a climate of intimidation there with these guys with assault rifles standing around.
[01:42:34.855 --> 01:42:36.276]  One woman came up with a sign, and...
[01:42:36.776 --> 01:42:39.497]  And she had to take her sign down because they wouldn't allow signs.
[01:42:39.657 --> 01:42:40.578]  It's a free country, yeah.
[01:42:40.598 --> 01:42:42.518]  The men in nice black masks don't have signs.
[01:42:42.558 --> 01:42:45.159]  It's because we have the media saying the truth on the sign.
[01:42:45.179 --> 01:42:47.740]  I mean, this country's just gone to hell in a handbasket.
[01:42:47.760 --> 01:43:05.767]  There were also people not even participating in the press conference, but there as part of the audience who were told by officials of the court, it looked like, that they had been ID'd as protesters and therefore they were under special scrutiny because I guess their faces had been fed into a computer and out it came that they were
[01:43:06.377 --> 01:43:07.338]  Subversive element.
[01:43:07.398 --> 01:43:09.360]  So, not a good situation.
[01:43:11.021 --> 01:43:14.404]  Yeah, it's sad to see our country dying.
[01:43:15.245 --> 01:43:18.407]  It's really sad to see a once-free country just go right down the tubes.
[01:43:18.447 --> 01:43:25.733]  But this is what happens when we get decadent and let tyranny get its roots down into the population.
[01:43:25.753 --> 01:43:34.621]  The reason we can do this is based on apathy, passivity, lack of activism, lack of righteous anger, lack of indignation.
[01:43:35.572 --> 01:43:36.252]  And what have you.
[01:43:36.292 --> 01:43:45.035]  So it's time to take advantage of this opportunity and make the issue explode, because there's an element of agitation in this without which nothing is going to happen, right?
[01:43:45.175 --> 01:43:54.818]  If it weren't for your interview with Charlie Sheen, if it weren't for this lecture series in New York City, there would be nothing to work with, and there would be no way to make this stuff explode.
[01:43:54.878 --> 01:44:00.380]  So the 9-11 Truth Movement is historically indispensable to any outcome from this crisis.
[01:44:01.274 --> 01:44:02.315]  Because this is the issue.
[01:44:02.375 --> 01:44:07.097]  Remember, 35 to 40 percent of the population in the United States are terrified.
[01:44:07.117 --> 01:44:08.418]  They're sincerely terrified.
[01:44:08.778 --> 01:44:12.600]  These are not sophisticated people, but they've bought into the 9-11 myth.
[01:44:12.640 --> 01:44:20.704]  They believe all this stuff about al-Qaeda, bin Laden, the cave in Afghanistan, the laptop, and they believe Bush's claim that he's going to protect them.
[01:44:21.205 --> 01:44:29.169]  And the only way you can separate that group from Bush, Bush's political base, is to show that 9-11 was an inside job
[01:44:30.021 --> 01:44:34.345]  The FBI obviously let it happen, but other parts of the government made it happen.
[01:44:34.725 --> 01:44:41.071]  Networks, rogue networks inside the government, generally marching to the tune of Wall Street and the City of London.
[01:44:42.973 --> 01:44:43.994]  Well, I agree with you.
[01:44:45.855 --> 01:44:49.098]  So when do you think we're going to see... I mean, things are already accelerating.
[01:44:49.118 --> 01:44:50.940]  When do you think you're going to see an even greater acceleration?
[01:44:51.300 --> 01:44:54.884]  Well, it can't predict it according to a...
[01:44:55.743 --> 01:44:56.443]  A timetable.
[01:44:56.503 --> 01:45:03.404]  Again, I think if you look at the Musawi trial in Alexandria, you've already got something that's reaching critical mass.
[01:45:03.504 --> 01:45:08.605]  It is clear that the FBI was crawling all over Musawi like lice.
[01:45:09.205 --> 01:45:10.426]  They knew when he got up.
[01:45:10.546 --> 01:45:12.046]  They knew every move he made.
[01:45:12.546 --> 01:45:14.686]  And nevertheless, they knew who his confederates were.
[01:45:14.726 --> 01:45:15.667]  They knew his networks.
[01:45:16.007 --> 01:45:18.487]  They had been following him since 1999.
[01:45:19.227 --> 01:45:21.848]  And they stubbornly refused to put him in jail.
[01:45:21.908 --> 01:45:23.888]  They stubbornly refused to lay a glove on him.
[01:45:24.352 --> 01:45:27.953]  We've had the testimony of this guy, Michael Rollins, of the FBI.
[01:45:28.013 --> 01:45:33.555]  He was the head of the International Counterterrorism Investigating Bureau of the FBI.
[01:45:33.595 --> 01:45:37.976]  Now, just to see who this guy is, many people know the name of David Frasca.
[01:45:38.336 --> 01:45:42.337]  David Frasca is one of the classic moles of September 11th.
[01:45:42.397 --> 01:45:46.398]  He was the head of the Radical Islam Bureau inside the FBI.
[01:45:46.758 --> 01:45:53.340]  It was David Frasca who received the Minneapolis memorandum of Colleen Rowley and the Phoenix memorandum of...
[01:45:54.085 --> 01:45:55.626]  Kenneth Williams, I think his name was.
[01:45:56.127 --> 01:46:04.213]  And Frasca was the one who proceeded to suppress, to sit on, to sabotage any move, to look inside Musawi's computer and so forth.
[01:46:04.673 --> 01:46:07.776]  Michael Rollins is the boss of David Frasca.
[01:46:08.236 --> 01:46:18.404]  So Rollins comes up and the defense shows him this important memo from a guy in Minneapolis, one of Colleen Rowley's colleagues, Harry Samet from Minneapolis.
[01:46:18.917 --> 01:46:26.140]  And this is a memo to FBI headquarters saying we've got to arrest this Moussaoui and look inside his computer.
[01:46:26.660 --> 01:46:30.882]  And Michael Rollins says, oh my gosh, I never saw that memorandum.
[01:46:31.462 --> 01:46:35.004]  Now we're at the level of pure insanity here.
[01:46:35.484 --> 01:46:41.347]  This is clearly a network of moles that are acting to protect patsies.
[01:46:41.727 --> 01:46:44.268]  And again, the reason they have to do this, it's not because...
[01:46:44.804 --> 01:46:47.486]  Musawi is going to carry out 9-11.
[01:46:47.546 --> 01:46:50.648]  It's not because he's going to take over an airplane and fly it anywhere.
[01:46:50.948 --> 01:46:51.508]  He can't.
[01:46:51.868 --> 01:46:52.749]  He's a psychotic.
[01:46:52.889 --> 01:46:53.990]  He's a basket case.
[01:46:54.430 --> 01:46:55.571]  He's pathetic.
[01:46:56.211 --> 01:46:57.652]  He's probably a double agent.
[01:46:58.072 --> 01:47:05.977]  But if you don't have people like Musawi running around, you can't make them into the Lee Harvey Oswalds, the scapegoats of what's going to happen.
[01:47:06.037 --> 01:47:06.457]  Well, you're right.
[01:47:06.497 --> 01:47:07.818]  Here's another example of that.
[01:47:09.415 --> 01:47:10.276]  George Bush, Jr.
[01:47:10.316 --> 01:47:17.324]  brought in 3,400-plus Iraqi Republican Guard at the end of the first Gulf War in 1991-92.
[01:47:18.385 --> 01:47:28.617]  And these are men who'd already been CIA-trained in Virginia and other places, Alabama, back when Saddam was our big ally in the mid-1990s during the Iran-Iraq War.
[01:47:29.608 --> 01:47:31.631]  Then they brought 3,400 back in.
[01:47:31.691 --> 01:47:32.932]  Clinton brought in roughly another 2,000.
[01:47:32.993 --> 01:47:34.114]  That's L.A.
[01:47:34.154 --> 01:47:35.215]  Times, Washington Times.
[01:47:35.235 --> 01:47:36.357]  That was in the news at the time.
[01:47:36.858 --> 01:47:38.500]  And then we know their names.
[01:47:38.580 --> 01:47:39.921]  Local police would arrest them.
[01:47:40.442 --> 01:47:43.166]  They were ID'd, videotaped at the Alfred P. Murrow building.
[01:47:43.486 --> 01:47:44.908]  We know their government agents.
[01:47:44.968 --> 01:47:46.330]  And it's the same thing with the supposed...
[01:47:46.870 --> 01:47:47.551]  Hijackers.
[01:47:47.992 --> 01:47:51.816]  The dean of the Defense Language School in Monterey, California goes, Hey, these guys, the U.S.
[01:47:51.856 --> 01:47:52.557]  government did this.
[01:47:52.738 --> 01:47:53.679]  I trained these guys.
[01:47:54.720 --> 01:47:55.381]  I'm the dean.
[01:47:56.182 --> 01:47:58.465]  Then it's MSNBC, but then it gets shut down.
[01:47:58.485 --> 01:48:01.128]  They admit, okay, three of the hijackers trained Pensacola Naval Air Station.
[01:48:01.829 --> 01:48:02.669]  This is called the News Journal.
[01:48:03.070 --> 01:48:04.310]  I interview heads of U.S.
[01:48:04.370 --> 01:48:07.331]  embassies who were ordered to, quote, let them back into the country.
[01:48:07.351 --> 01:48:08.712]  They go, but they're on terrorist watch lists.
[01:48:08.732 --> 01:48:11.593]  They say it's part of an anti-terror operation.
[01:48:11.613 --> 01:48:12.513]  These are our agents.
[01:48:12.913 --> 01:48:20.136]  I mean, we know that these hijackers, however they fit into the story, were government agents.
[01:48:20.917 --> 01:48:23.218]  And that is verifiable on its face.
[01:48:24.198 --> 01:48:24.578]  Exactly.
[01:48:24.618 --> 01:48:27.719]  They're government agents of the patsy variety.
[01:48:27.759 --> 01:48:29.300]  They're people who are expendable.
[01:48:29.884 --> 01:48:30.225]  Thank you.
[01:48:30.265 --> 01:48:30.505]  Thank you.
[01:48:38.641 --> 01:48:46.488]  He was born in the... Yeah, the individuals that bombed the First World Trade Center were both mentally retarded, and the FBI had to train them how to drive it and build the bomb for them and the rest of it.
[01:48:46.509 --> 01:48:55.937]  But let me just, before we go to break here, get your take on the mindset of these... I mean, not just the moles, but their handlers.
[01:48:56.338 --> 01:49:00.281]  How do these people in our government... I mean, they're just, I guess, grade-A psychopaths.
[01:49:00.562 --> 01:49:01.282]  They must like their work.
[01:49:03.471 --> 01:49:19.162]  Well, on the part of the moles, on the part of the invisible government network, well, these are people who, they are aggressive elitists, and they believe in, you can see from their track record what they believe in.
[01:49:19.222 --> 01:49:24.706]  They believe in the Bay of Pigs, the Kennedy assassination, the Gulf of Tonkin incident, the Vietnam War.
[01:49:25.186 --> 01:49:26.487]  They believe in Iran-Contra.
[01:49:26.507 --> 01:49:28.148]  They believe in gun-running, drug-running.
[01:49:29.041 --> 01:49:34.403]  They always prefer military solutions and they have this idea of financing it all through narcotics.
[01:49:34.503 --> 01:49:38.925]  And almost all of them made their bones when they were 20 years old in conflicts.
[01:49:38.985 --> 01:49:40.545]  And so, life's cheap.
[01:49:40.665 --> 01:49:41.766]  Six plus billion people.
[01:49:42.726 --> 01:49:44.407]  I mean, we're the most plentiful thing on the world.
[01:49:44.447 --> 01:49:45.467]  We're cheap to them, folks.
[01:49:46.047 --> 01:49:48.868]  They see us like a carton of eggs or a pound of hamburger meat.
[01:49:49.248 --> 01:49:50.449]  A box of Twinkies.
[01:49:50.469 --> 01:49:51.329]  We're to be consumed.
[01:49:53.900 --> 01:49:58.227]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:49:58.447 --> 01:50:02.854]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:50:03.014 --> 01:50:07.381]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:50:07.421 --> 01:50:08.783]  The New World Order.
[01:50:10.564 --> 01:50:14.766]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:50:14.846 --> 01:50:21.768]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:50:21.908 --> 01:50:23.909]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:50:24.309 --> 01:50:34.635]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:50:34.895 --> 01:50:40.258]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[01:50:53.704 --> 01:50:57.605]  Black Berkey replacement elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[01:50:57.845 --> 01:51:03.266]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[01:51:03.546 --> 01:51:13.909]  Ideal for travel or outdoor events and perfect in the event of hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies because they remove both harmful chemicals and pathogenic bacteria from water.
[01:51:14.069 --> 01:51:18.410]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:51:18.610 --> 01:51:26.972]  Trihalomethane and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and NTBE are removed to below detectable limits.
[01:51:27.232 --> 01:51:33.594]  They reduce nitrate and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, aluminum, copper, and fowl taste like chlorine and sulfur odors.
[01:51:33.714 --> 01:51:38.195]  Yet the Black Berkey filter elements leave in the helpful and beneficial minerals that your body needs.
[01:51:38.415 --> 01:51:42.617]  Normally $48 each, get a two-pack for only $91 or a four-pack for only $173.
[01:51:42.737 --> 01:51:47.298]  Get the powerful Black Berkey replacement filters now by calling New Millennium at 888-

[01:52:10.339 --> 01:52:10.999]  We're good to go.
[01:52:32.950 --> 01:52:33.791]  We're good to go.
[01:52:33.871 --> 01:52:34.112]  I think?
[01:52:56.238 --> 01:53:02.263]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:53:02.864 --> 01:53:05.866]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:07.507 --> 01:53:10.170]  All right.
[01:53:11.931 --> 01:53:12.471]  We're back.
[01:53:12.692 --> 01:53:18.376]  And this poor man was shot execution style twice in the head, 9-1-1 truth scholar.
[01:53:20.678 --> 01:53:25.162]  And, you know, degreed microbiologist getting another doctorate.
[01:53:26.241 --> 01:53:29.802]  And the police have a surveillance tape of him being killed.
[01:53:30.762 --> 01:53:32.863]  And his mother and others were there and are witnesses.
[01:53:33.943 --> 01:53:35.943]  And I'm looking at articles yesterday about this.
[01:53:36.004 --> 01:53:37.324]  And this happened Saturday.
[01:53:37.424 --> 01:53:39.024]  And they aren't releasing the video.
[01:53:39.924 --> 01:53:41.185]  And they aren't giving a description.
[01:53:42.085 --> 01:53:46.466]  And I just talked to the folks running the show up in Minneapolis-St.
[01:53:46.486 --> 01:53:46.586]  Paul.
[01:53:46.606 --> 01:53:47.166]  That's where they're at.
[01:53:47.186 --> 01:53:48.547]  And he said he saw on the news last night.
[01:53:49.567 --> 01:53:50.887]  John, who's running the broadcast, did.
[01:53:52.168 --> 01:53:53.868]  And no video whatsoever.
[01:53:54.890 --> 01:53:55.952]  And no description.
[01:53:57.715 --> 01:54:00.299]  They're just trying to find some crackhead right now, I guess, to blame it on.
[01:54:00.319 --> 01:54:03.364]  And in front of everyone, they won't release the video to confirm it's him.
[01:54:04.726 --> 01:54:08.933]  And whenever they do have a political assassination, there are going to be cameras right above it, and they just won't release it.
[01:54:09.742 --> 01:54:11.764]  And it sounds like an assassination to me.
[01:54:12.324 --> 01:54:17.348]  Webster, can you, I mean, in every other case, they release the tape, the cops say, we're looking for this man.
[01:54:17.368 --> 01:54:20.210]  And how dumb are the police there in Minneapolis?
[01:54:20.230 --> 01:54:24.914]  They've got to know it's the government if they're just being told, no, you don't release descriptions and you don't release video.
[01:54:25.475 --> 01:54:26.275]  You're absolutely right.
[01:54:26.315 --> 01:54:37.720]  The only obvious parallels for this are the surveillance cameras at the Pentagon, and the gas station, and the hotel, and the highway out by the Pentagon that the FBI suppressed.
[01:54:37.920 --> 01:54:40.140]  Oklahoma City FBI agents went on record in the L.A.
[01:54:40.180 --> 01:54:50.944]  Times and said, we saw it, and it showed, by name, Al Hussein, Hussein, and others, they're getting out of the car with McVeigh, and they've declared national security, and there were 12 different cameras that picked this up.
[01:54:51.285 --> 01:54:52.285]  So, I mean, it's just...
[01:54:53.245 --> 01:54:57.548]  I mean, I can't believe they're not giving a description, because they can't!
[01:54:59.829 --> 01:55:14.337]  Well, I think it's time also to think if there's not some legal remedy on something this specific and this blatant and this timely to get some kind of amicus curiae or civil action suit demanding that the surveillance camera now be revealed so we can see what happened.
[01:55:15.032 --> 01:55:19.094]  And also, accountability for the elements and the police who didn't put that out.
[01:55:19.494 --> 01:55:21.775]  That should have been broadcast immediately.
[01:55:21.815 --> 01:55:24.937]  They should have broken into the various news channels.
[01:55:24.977 --> 01:55:25.697]  Well, they do.
[01:55:25.817 --> 01:55:26.297]  They do.
[01:55:26.357 --> 01:55:28.979]  They act like our saviors when it's not them killing us.
[01:55:29.239 --> 01:55:35.322]  Well, you know, you can have a high-speed car chase, or you can have any number of events, and they put it up there right away.
[01:55:35.362 --> 01:55:36.642]  And in some cases, they should.
[01:55:37.083 --> 01:55:44.046]  But in this case, certainly, because of the obvious political overtones, this intersection of the biotechnology assassinations and the
[01:55:44.586 --> 01:55:52.388]  The 9-11 issue, I think that makes it into a suspected political assassination, and everybody has to take that seriously.
[01:55:54.008 --> 01:55:58.310]  I would also call in particular on people to think about our left gatekeepers.
[01:55:58.630 --> 01:56:02.771]  There's a whole class of people who have been silent on this issue, right?
[01:56:02.791 --> 01:56:07.792]  We've now seen New York Magazine take the plunge into 9-11 truth, CNN show business tonight,
[01:56:08.311 --> 01:56:09.092]  The Village Voice.
[01:56:09.272 --> 01:56:18.740]  I'm looking at people like Seymour Hersh of The New Yorker, Noam Chomsky, Amy Goodman of Democracy Now!, Greg Palast, Michael Moore, the great filmmaker.
[01:56:18.820 --> 01:56:21.142]  Come on, you know exactly who Noam Chomsky is.
[01:56:21.242 --> 01:56:23.404]  Well, yes I do, but I think it's time now.
[01:56:23.744 --> 01:56:24.605]  I'm putting it up there.
[01:56:25.025 --> 01:56:27.948]  If these people don't come forward, then they are exposed.
[01:56:27.988 --> 01:56:29.429]  Then everybody should see who they are.
[01:56:29.789 --> 01:56:36.435]  Molly Ivins, Gore Vidal, The Nation Magazine, Counterpunch, James Ridgway, and on and on, David Corn...
[01:56:37.476 --> 01:56:45.525]  All of these people who have some kind of reputation as being watchdogs of the excesses of the federal government, a lot of them have been totally silent about 9-11.
[01:56:46.508 --> 01:56:47.709]  And everything connected with that.
[01:56:47.769 --> 01:56:55.674]  Now is the time for these people either to do something or to retreat into obscurity, and we should be done with them.
[01:56:55.714 --> 01:57:01.318]  And, of course, Noam Chomsky, he's obviously helped along by the fact that the Pentagon finances his institute.
[01:57:01.398 --> 01:57:08.884]  All these college people, when I had him on and attacked him, and they think I'm talking about God or something.
[01:57:09.224 --> 01:57:10.885]  The guy, I've read his books.
[01:57:11.005 --> 01:57:13.407]  I mean, you're a hundred times a scholar he is.
[01:57:13.587 --> 01:57:13.827]  I am.
[01:57:13.867 --> 01:57:14.848]  The guy is a quack.
[01:57:15.488 --> 01:57:19.250]  And, you know, oh, the government didn't have a hand in killing Kennedy.
[01:57:20.131 --> 01:57:21.752]  There's not a one world government.
[01:57:22.092 --> 01:57:23.433]  Let's turn our guns in.
[01:57:23.453 --> 01:57:27.855]  I mean, he's Pentagon funded all the way by DARPA.
[01:57:28.315 --> 01:57:31.037]  The guy is an absolute piece of trash.
[01:57:33.938 --> 01:57:38.181]  Order a copy of this show for your friends and family at GCNlive.com or call 877-300-7645.
[01:57:49.807 --> 01:57:50.448]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.108 --> 01:57:52.188]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:52.888 --> 01:57:53.968]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.629 --> 01:57:55.449]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.209 --> 01:57:57.129]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.149 --> 01:58:01.510]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:01.950 --> 01:58:06.071]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:06.952 --> 01:58:09.452]  It isn't a joke, it isn't a game, it isn't a drill.
[01:58:10.973 --> 01:58:16.034]  The elite we have around this planet are the ancestors of the royalty of the banking establishment.
[01:58:16.878 --> 01:58:19.220]  And we're joined, of course, by Webster Griffin Tarbley.
[01:58:19.260 --> 01:58:19.880]  He's author of
[01:58:46.192 --> 01:58:47.353]  Bombshell book.
[01:58:47.393 --> 01:58:50.635]  Great researchers have been reporting on government-sponsored terror for over two decades.
[01:58:51.475 --> 01:58:53.456]  Written seminal papers over 20 years on the subject.
[01:58:54.197 --> 01:59:00.280]  And I want to talk a little bit about the stay-behind networks and Gladio and some of the declassified, admitted U.S.
[01:59:00.300 --> 01:59:02.381]  government terror ops that have been carried out.
[01:59:02.401 --> 01:59:07.104]  And I, of course, brought up one of those on CNN last night.
[01:59:07.992 --> 01:59:09.533]  And I'll be back on this evening.
[01:59:10.313 --> 01:59:12.314]  But I also want to take some of your calls.
[01:59:12.514 --> 01:59:16.135]  So right now, let's go ahead and take some of your calls.
[01:59:16.275 --> 01:59:17.736]  Who's up first here in line?
[01:59:19.456 --> 01:59:21.057]  Dr. Deagle, good to have you on.
[01:59:21.097 --> 01:59:21.797]  What's on your mind?
[01:59:22.798 --> 01:59:23.298]  Hi, Alex.
[01:59:23.358 --> 01:59:28.580]  You're definitely the Paul Revere of this movement, and I very much respect that.
[01:59:29.160 --> 01:59:32.181]  A comment regarding the Hutchinson-Lempoa case.
[01:59:33.041 --> 01:59:35.803]  And the takeover of the scanning nuclear units?
[01:59:36.143 --> 01:59:43.788]  Yeah, I mean, openly, the communist Chinese military is going to take over port security in one of the biggest ports in our hemisphere that our country owns.
[01:59:44.589 --> 01:59:48.031]  And our police will not be there.
[01:59:48.111 --> 01:59:49.032]  Customs will not be there.
[01:59:49.052 --> 01:59:50.132]  That is Associated Press.
[01:59:50.373 --> 01:59:55.376]  Well, just like you journalistically won't release your sources, I can't because they're friends of mine in NSA.
[01:59:56.056 --> 02:00:02.701]  But I know very specific sites where they have pre-placed Chinese communist military munitions
[02:00:06.041 --> 02:00:06.401]  Are you there?
[02:00:09.103 --> 02:00:11.905]  Wow, as soon as he said that, somebody, I guess his phone cut out.
[02:00:11.925 --> 02:00:12.585]  Call back in.
[02:00:13.306 --> 02:00:15.047]  You know, I'll place it in my memory.
[02:00:15.067 --> 02:00:22.892]  A couple of our guests have pointed out Freeport, Bahamas, and this port as where they would bring them in at.
[02:00:23.393 --> 02:00:29.337]  But don't worry, the nuclear scanners will be run, the atomic scanners will be run by the Chinese military.
[02:00:31.425 --> 02:00:35.448]  Okay, well, let's get Jack Blood's take on all of this.
[02:00:35.909 --> 02:00:37.310]  Since Dr. Deagle dropped.
[02:00:37.350 --> 02:00:38.250]  Jack, what's on your mind?
[02:00:38.771 --> 02:00:39.211]  Hey, Alex.
[02:00:39.391 --> 02:00:40.452]  Thanks for taking my call.
[02:00:40.472 --> 02:00:41.473]  I appreciate it.
[02:00:41.573 --> 02:00:46.877]  I was actually going to call in and feed you the story that Dylan Avery had brought to bear.
[02:00:46.897 --> 02:00:51.140]  I actually have Jim Fetzer on my program, which, as most people know, follows yours today.
[02:00:51.461 --> 02:00:54.223]  And he is the spokesperson for 9-11 Scholars for Truth.
[02:00:54.611 --> 02:00:56.894]  And what he's told me is there's a couple of things.
[02:00:57.254 --> 02:01:01.199]  One is that this was done in the dark, so, and there were a ton of witnesses, so it made no
[02:01:01.852 --> 02:01:06.275]  Absolutely no sense that these robbers shot Michael Zubar.
[02:01:06.695 --> 02:01:11.858]  You know, they might as well have shot all the witnesses, and the witnesses said that you couldn't even describe these guys.
[02:01:11.898 --> 02:01:21.825]  This was a purse-snatching, Alex, in an uptown, upscale neighborhood in Minnesota, and it falls right in the line with a lot of the other political assassinations that we've seen.
[02:01:22.125 --> 02:01:23.846]  Also, I'd like to say something else.
[02:01:23.866 --> 02:01:27.048]  Jack, your phone is just, it's almost unintelligible.
[02:01:27.068 --> 02:01:28.669]  Can you back off of it?
[02:01:29.129 --> 02:01:29.389]  Right.
[02:01:29.570 --> 02:01:30.050]  Is this better?
[02:01:30.948 --> 02:01:32.049]  Is it a cordless cell phone?
[02:01:32.310 --> 02:01:33.311]  It's a cordless, Alex.
[02:01:33.871 --> 02:01:35.493]  Okay, sure.
[02:01:35.533 --> 02:01:36.074]  Keep trying.
[02:01:36.134 --> 02:01:39.037]  I'm just going to drop one other thing on you real quick.
[02:01:39.117 --> 02:01:43.521]  The story was reported by WCCO, which is a giant CBS affiliate.
[02:01:43.541 --> 02:01:44.102]  Yes, I have it.
[02:01:44.402 --> 02:01:50.749]  And I thought that it was rather interesting that the headline is 9-11 callers traumatized by uptown murder.
[02:01:51.389 --> 02:01:59.272]  Putting 9-11 and traumatized in that title almost seems to be sending a message to people who might be reading this story, even if it's subliminal.
[02:01:59.732 --> 02:02:01.213]  And I thought that was rather fishy as well.
[02:02:01.233 --> 02:02:04.314]  Well, look at the use of 9-11, how the government chose that date.
[02:02:04.374 --> 02:02:05.114]  Webster, comment.
[02:02:06.815 --> 02:02:07.175]  I don't know.
[02:02:07.235 --> 02:02:09.175]  I'm not much for numerology.
[02:02:09.235 --> 02:02:12.817]  I think they had to do it someday, so they chose it that day.
[02:02:13.037 --> 02:02:16.538]  Hey, Jack, if you want to comment real quick, they can dial you up on the digital line if you want.
[02:02:17.034 --> 02:02:20.235]  Well, listen, I've got Jim Fetzer on my program, airing right after yours today.
[02:02:20.255 --> 02:02:23.857]  We're going to talk about this ad nauseum, so if people want to hear more about it, they can listen.
[02:02:24.157 --> 02:02:24.938]  All right, all right.
[02:02:25.018 --> 02:02:29.159]  Well, I was saying if you wanted, you could dial in and do that, only because the phone's pretty bad.
[02:02:29.580 --> 02:02:30.980]  All right, thanks for the call, Jack.
[02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:31.581]  Good to hear from you.
[02:02:31.841 --> 02:02:35.062]  We'll come back and get into more news, and then we'll continue with your calls.
[02:02:35.082 --> 02:02:35.142]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:02:35.162 --> 02:02:37.363]  And in about 25 minutes, we are scheduled to be joined by Charlie Sheen.
[02:02:46.710 --> 02:02:49.553]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[02:02:49.813 --> 02:02:51.415]  Hello, my friends, Alex Jones here.
[02:02:51.735 --> 02:02:56.419]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law, 9-11, Rise of the Police State.
[02:02:56.760 --> 02:03:03.506]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[02:03:03.826 --> 02:03:05.787]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[02:03:06.008 --> 02:03:08.850]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[02:03:08.950 --> 02:03:13.613]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[02:03:13.813 --> 02:03:18.216]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[02:03:18.456 --> 02:03:25.681]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[02:03:25.921 --> 02:03:28.343]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.
[02:03:28.503 --> 02:03:30.244]  Call toll-free to get a copy of Martial Law.
[02:03:30.384 --> 02:03:36.389]  1-888-253-3139 Or visit Infowars.com and the secure shopping cart.

[02:03:46.141 --> 02:03:56.886]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microforce filtration coupled with modern state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.
[02:03:57.066 --> 02:04:04.530]  The revolutionary Berkey Light with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:04:04.870 --> 02:04:08.053]  Harmful or unwanted chemicals are reduced to below detectable levels.
[02:04:08.294 --> 02:04:14.059]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving the nutritional minerals your body needs.
[02:04:14.320 --> 02:04:20.486]  Made of durable Lexan, the material used in making bulletproof glass, the system is durable, rugged, and yet attractive.
[02:04:20.826 --> 02:04:24.728]  The Berkey light is transparent, so there is no guesswork when refilling the system.
[02:04:24.768 --> 02:04:26.669]  The water level is always visible.
[02:04:26.849 --> 02:04:32.791]  The rechargeable LED lighting system is beautiful as a nightlight and as necessary in emergency situations.
[02:04:33.031 --> 02:04:36.973]  Get the Berkey light, the transparent water filter, for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:04:36.993 --> 02:04:37.573]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[02:04:46.337 --> 02:04:49.659]  And now a word from Dr. Patricia Margaitis from Stem Enhance.
[02:04:50.079 --> 02:04:54.241]  I want to first thank the wonderful GCN listeners for supporting Stem Enhance.
[02:04:54.782 --> 02:05:02.166]  Now know that your own stem cells are your body's maintenance group, and Stem Enhance makes sure that more of them show up for work every day.
[02:05:02.591 --> 02:05:06.572]  The truth is, the more stem cells you have in your bloodstream, the greater your health.
[02:05:06.952 --> 02:05:20.416]  If you believe there is something more for you, have a strong work ethic, and wish to participate in the monumental increase in the cause for natural health while gaining financial independence and monthly cash flow, then you are the right person.
[02:05:20.816 --> 02:05:24.217]  I personally invite you to join me as a distributor of Stem Enhancement.
[02:05:24.597 --> 02:05:28.859]  I am committed to personally make sure you receive the tools needed to succeed.
[02:05:29.200 --> 02:05:32.121]  Remember, the first rule of success, you must show up.
[02:05:32.281 --> 02:05:35.583]  Call me, Dr. Patricia Margitis, at 860-567-7744.
[02:05:35.603 --> 02:05:36.584]  That number again, 860-567-7744.
[02:05:50.004 --> 02:05:50.644]  Big Brother.
[02:05:51.304 --> 02:05:52.385]  Mainstream media.
[02:05:53.085 --> 02:05:54.186]  Government cover-ups.
[02:05:54.846 --> 02:05:55.646]  You want answers?
[02:05:56.427 --> 02:05:57.287]  Well, so does he.
[02:05:57.967 --> 02:06:01.649]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:02.169 --> 02:06:06.271]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:06:12.214 --> 02:06:16.996]  Hi, going back to Webster Griffin Tarpley, author of 9-1-1 Synthetic Terror, our guest.
[02:06:20.060 --> 02:06:26.422]  Mr. Tarpley, continuing, I want to go back to Dr. Deagle, caller and also host show here on the network.
[02:06:26.462 --> 02:06:29.724]  Dr. Deagle, finish up, Bill Deagle, finish up the point you were making when your phone dropped.
[02:06:30.064 --> 02:06:32.184]  Yeah, I'm sure it dropped because they wanted to intervene.
[02:06:32.204 --> 02:06:44.689]  Yeah, I carried quite a bit of discussions with my NSA buddies and CIA when I was working in Colorado, and also Colonel Craig Roberts, and I won't release my sources, but they have pre-placed in America
[02:06:45.979 --> 02:06:50.140]  Lots of munitions and other equipment and so on for an invasion of America.
[02:06:50.260 --> 02:06:54.261]  And I was told this by agents, literally, that were hardened military personnel.
[02:06:54.401 --> 02:06:57.002]  And they were in a cold sweat when they told me this back in the mid-90s.
[02:06:58.382 --> 02:07:05.044]  And Colonel Roberts, of course, confirmed that the largest pre-placement facility in the world for the communist Chinese is in Freeport, Bahamas.
[02:07:05.084 --> 02:07:06.244]  Yeah, he's the guy that said that.
[02:07:06.604 --> 02:07:11.305]  Yeah, isn't it interesting that it's exactly where they're going to be managing these scanners without our...
[02:07:11.843 --> 02:07:13.043]  I mean, we've entered the outer limits here.
[02:07:13.063 --> 02:07:14.143]  I want to get a comment from Webster Tarpley.
[02:07:14.163 --> 02:07:14.404]  Absolutely.
[02:07:36.829 --> 02:07:37.229]  Certainly.
[02:07:37.710 --> 02:07:41.555]  There's absolutely no reason for foreign companies to run ports in the United States.
[02:07:42.276 --> 02:07:46.321]  I think you can see that just on globalization, global-only grounds.
[02:07:46.902 --> 02:07:47.263]  There's no...
[02:07:47.788 --> 02:07:49.148]  No reason in the world for this.
[02:07:50.069 --> 02:07:53.069]  Every country should have national sovereignty and should run its own ports.
[02:07:53.409 --> 02:08:04.272]  And we don't need the degenerate emir of Dubai with his wage-gouging, union-busting policies to come in here, because that's one of the reasons the Wall Street people like these guys, because you can imagine what their labor policies are.
[02:08:04.292 --> 02:08:07.892]  There's no opposition in the United Arab Emirates, that's for sure.
[02:08:08.273 --> 02:08:09.233]  It's outrageous.
[02:08:09.533 --> 02:08:10.073]  Outrageous.
[02:08:10.113 --> 02:08:11.033]  Dr. Deagle, thank you.
[02:08:11.373 --> 02:08:11.873]  Thanks a lot.
[02:08:11.993 --> 02:08:12.293]  You bet.
[02:08:12.393 --> 02:08:14.514]  Mike in Arizona, you're on the air with our guest.
[02:08:14.534 --> 02:08:14.894]  Go ahead.
[02:08:16.483 --> 02:08:17.904]  Say, good evening, Alex.
[02:08:18.324 --> 02:08:18.824]  Welcome.
[02:08:19.284 --> 02:08:23.807]  First off, I'd like to say congratulations for what you've done here in the last few days.
[02:08:24.307 --> 02:08:25.328]  Really, really great.
[02:08:25.408 --> 02:08:27.509]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[02:08:28.829 --> 02:08:29.250]  Thank you.
[02:08:29.850 --> 02:08:30.090]  Yes.
[02:08:30.490 --> 02:08:39.995]  A couple of things I noticed, you know, that the way they try to smear you on the national news, they always try to throw in these words conspiracy and cult and everything.
[02:08:40.015 --> 02:08:41.656]  Or liberal.
[02:08:42.256 --> 02:08:42.756]  Yeah, sure.
[02:08:42.916 --> 02:08:43.457]  Absolutely.
[02:08:43.497 --> 02:08:46.018]  The way it's up is down and left is right and everything.
[02:08:46.397 --> 02:08:52.304]  But, you know, your guest there, Mr. Webster, he's mentioned a couple of times about Watergate and everything.
[02:08:52.324 --> 02:08:57.530]  Now, we have these two famous journalists called Woodward and Bernstein.
[02:08:57.970 --> 02:09:05.659]  Now, when they first started off, they were looking into a conspiracy, but I noticed that the mainstream media never calls them conspiracy theorists.
[02:09:06.520 --> 02:09:13.844]  And, you know, did Nixon and Dean and Liddy and Haldeman, did they or did they not conspire to break into the Watergate?
[02:09:14.364 --> 02:09:19.907]  Did they or did they not conspire to cover it up and to smear and to blame others and all those things?
[02:09:20.667 --> 02:09:28.051]  And now look at these federal prosecutors, and the guest was also mentioned about this FBI agent testifying here in this Zacharias Massawi case.
[02:09:28.930 --> 02:09:33.214]  How many times have you heard this term, unindicted co-conspirators?
[02:09:33.614 --> 02:09:40.659]  Are federal prosecutors conspiracy theorists because they do have a theory about a conspiracy and all they have to do is prove it?
[02:09:42.240 --> 02:09:43.181]  No, I agree with you.
[02:09:44.602 --> 02:09:52.628]  We have cases which are admitted and declassified in public that Nixon planned to bomb the Republican National Convention to blame it on his enemies.
[02:09:52.868 --> 02:09:57.792]  They just do this over and over and over and over and over again.
[02:09:58.567 --> 02:09:59.587]  Yes, absolutely.
[02:09:59.847 --> 02:10:01.008]  Oh, and one other thing, too.
[02:10:01.508 --> 02:10:05.789]  Mr. Tarpley had mentioned this deal about the Phoenix Memo and Ken Williams.
[02:10:06.249 --> 02:10:06.489]  Yes.
[02:10:06.969 --> 02:10:12.230]  Another little part of that, there was a gentleman that worked here, and he's been over in the Middle East quite a bit.
[02:10:12.290 --> 02:10:21.872]  His name was Harry Evers, and he was the one that went to Ken Williams with this information about these people trying to learn how to fly these airplanes.
[02:10:21.972 --> 02:10:25.033]  But Mr. Evers, he was about 50 years old,
[02:10:25.461 --> 02:10:26.561]  So close to the trial!
[02:10:26.581 --> 02:10:27.082]  I understand.
[02:10:51.480 --> 02:10:52.801]  All right, thank you for the call, sir.
[02:10:52.861 --> 02:10:53.642]  I appreciate it.
[02:10:53.662 --> 02:10:57.164]  But 50-year-old men do have heart attacks, so we really can't say that that's what happened there.
[02:10:57.865 --> 02:11:02.829]  Let's go ahead and talk to, I guess, Reagan in California is up next.
[02:11:02.849 --> 02:11:03.269]  Go ahead.
[02:11:03.289 --> 02:11:04.970]  Hello?
[02:11:05.290 --> 02:11:05.511]  Yes.
[02:11:06.031 --> 02:11:06.852]  Hey, how are you?
[02:11:07.112 --> 02:11:07.512]  Fine.
[02:11:08.133 --> 02:11:09.994]  I've got a few things to talk about.
[02:11:10.054 --> 02:11:14.597]  Number one, I'm also a member of Scholars for 9-11 Truth and New York 9-11 Truth.
[02:11:15.970 --> 02:11:30.715]  They have a list of things that they were doing this week, and I forwarded those things to some people who are working to get the Twin Towers rebuilt, and I got a review from somebody telling me not to do it again.
[02:11:30.735 --> 02:11:36.817]  The problem for me is that the longer these towers stay away, the more obvious it is.
[02:11:37.437 --> 02:11:40.458]  Someone called about why they chose September 11th.
[02:11:40.518 --> 02:11:42.579]  I think I have a theory for you.
[02:11:43.848 --> 02:11:47.932]  On September 11, 1990, George Bush Sr.
[02:11:47.992 --> 02:11:50.014]  said something about the New World Order.
[02:11:50.274 --> 02:11:52.216]  Yeah, we see a New World Order coming into view.
[02:11:52.276 --> 02:11:55.679]  Yeah, and he got a lot of calls from people saying, no, you don't.
[02:11:56.279 --> 02:11:58.501]  And then 11 years later, look what happened.
[02:11:58.521 --> 02:12:01.684]  The very day to the day, September 11, 1990, he gets this.
[02:12:01.744 --> 02:12:03.766]  Well, thank you for the call.
[02:12:03.866 --> 02:12:05.928]  Certainly, 9-11 is a seminal foundational event.
[02:12:10.895 --> 02:12:14.299]  Let us now go ahead and take a call from Stuart in New York.
[02:12:14.379 --> 02:12:15.280]  Stuart, you're on the air.
[02:12:15.320 --> 02:12:15.740]  Go ahead.
[02:12:15.980 --> 02:12:16.981]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[02:12:17.041 --> 02:12:31.976]  I tell you, for somebody whose birthday is September 11th, which is mine, what you've done this past week is the best birthday present I've had perhaps in my whole life and certainly since 2001, and I can't find the words to thank you.
[02:12:32.458 --> 02:12:33.218]  Well, thank you, sir.
[02:12:33.358 --> 02:12:35.419]  No, thank you for being involved and caring about this country.
[02:12:35.639 --> 02:12:36.359]  Oh, very much so.
[02:12:36.679 --> 02:12:52.485]  I did notice on your website you had reprinted the post-Smir article on Mr. Sheen, and it turns out I thought that they were only mildly pejorative in their review.
[02:12:53.085 --> 02:13:01.108]  And, in fact, what they did was, even though they did say some negative things about Mr. Sheen, they revealed all his salient points.
[02:13:02.011 --> 02:13:03.511]  So they kind of like canceled each other.
[02:13:04.372 --> 02:13:08.773]  That's what I've noticed is either it's on purpose, it's people that are really on our side trying to be safe.
[02:13:08.793 --> 02:13:09.813]  They'll go, what idiots?
[02:13:10.193 --> 02:13:17.536]  They'll go, look at all these top military people and all these top CIA people and these German defense ministers saying the government's behind the terror.
[02:13:17.916 --> 02:13:19.876]  Wow, isn't Charlie Sheen crazy?
[02:13:20.217 --> 02:13:26.979]  And then links to WTC7.net and all these other great sites and links to our site.
[02:13:27.219 --> 02:13:27.779]  Oh, I mean...
[02:13:29.240 --> 02:13:35.504]  Certainly, Webster, don't you think some of these journalists are trying to protect themselves, but then really making themselves look stupid on purpose?
[02:13:35.644 --> 02:13:42.389]  I would suggest the way you can tell a real slander is a real slander will not deal with the main substantive points of the argument.
[02:13:42.409 --> 02:13:46.933]  They'll say, oh, you cite Joe Blow in a footnote, and Joe Blow is a proven psychotic.
[02:13:47.453 --> 02:13:54.377]  Yeah, all the neocons are just attacking Charlie Sheen personally and not even addressing what he said.
[02:13:54.757 --> 02:13:59.020]  Well, but the fact is that the material is getting out, and it's getting out massively.
[02:13:59.100 --> 02:14:00.801]  I would just say one thing about Charlie Sheen.
[02:14:00.821 --> 02:14:05.303]  I think one of the best things that he's done is to call for that international review panel.
[02:14:05.343 --> 02:14:06.664]  I've been working on that for years.
[02:14:06.744 --> 02:14:08.725]  It's the Independent International...
[02:14:09.235 --> 02:14:16.520]  Truth Commission, and interestingly enough, that took place in 1967 in Copenhagen, Denmark, as well as in Sweden.
[02:14:16.901 --> 02:14:26.627]  And this was, of course, the Russell Tribunal on Vietnam with Sartre and Blazara Cardenas of Mexico and a whole panel of international experts.
[02:14:26.707 --> 02:14:34.833]  This is what broke the back of the Johnson administration's aggressive war in Vietnam as far as world public opinion was concerned.
[02:14:34.893 --> 02:14:37.155]  And I would think that if Charlie Sheen keeps...
[02:14:37.685 --> 02:14:45.250]  Talking about that independent International Truth Commission, that is one of the ways we can get it, because I think that's ultimately the next step in all of this.
[02:14:45.290 --> 02:15:00.921]  We've got to find a way to put this entire story in front of world public opinion and have it validated by a group of eminent personalities and judged, indeed, evaluated, and send that around the world so that this crazy 9-11 myth comes crashing down.
[02:15:01.710 --> 02:15:05.454]  Well, it certainly is the big conspiracy theory, their story.
[02:15:05.594 --> 02:15:08.036]  Let's talk to Dave in California.
[02:15:08.056 --> 02:15:08.817]  Dave, you're on the air.
[02:15:08.837 --> 02:15:10.018]  Alex, good morning.
[02:15:10.258 --> 02:15:10.518]  Hi.
[02:15:10.899 --> 02:15:15.002]  You always have the most well-informed, intelligent, and brave guests on.
[02:15:15.523 --> 02:15:17.244]  Mr. Tarpley, God bless you, sir.
[02:15:17.665 --> 02:15:20.407]  I have nothing but respect for you, and I have one comment.
[02:15:21.008 --> 02:15:23.750]  It appears to me that all the evil stuff that they're doing...
[02:15:25.508 --> 02:15:34.674]  It advances their agenda, and it also acts as a distraction from 9-11, and my thought is that perhaps they know that 9-11 is the only thing that's sure to bring them down.
[02:15:34.694 --> 02:15:36.416]  Do you have a comment on that, sir?
[02:15:36.876 --> 02:15:39.498]  Well, again, the question is who and who are them?
[02:15:39.898 --> 02:15:50.326]  I think there's one group, as I said before, that thinks that you can have a limited hangout, a controlled revelation of certain parts of the scandal that will essentially break the link between Bush-Cheney and their
[02:15:50.825 --> 02:15:53.747]  Terrified base of 35 to 40 percent of the U.S.
[02:15:53.787 --> 02:15:54.407]  population.
[02:15:55.047 --> 02:16:07.495]  I think it's the task of the rest of us to try to push it forward so that it leads to the exposure of as much as possible of the invisible government, rogue network, deep state, secret government, whatever you want to call it.
[02:16:07.515 --> 02:16:11.777]  It's actually behind not just... Yeah, we'll get more into that with our final segment with Webster after the break.
[02:16:11.817 --> 02:16:12.277]  Thank you, Dave.
[02:16:12.297 --> 02:16:15.039]  Let me bring up something now in the minute we've got left before we go to break, Webster.
[02:16:16.378 --> 02:16:23.360]  I don't like getting into shop talk and stuff that goes on, but we never have people go on to the shopping cart and put fake orders in them.
[02:16:23.380 --> 02:16:40.664]  Now, these are real credit cards with sequential numbers leading down, and almost every day they'll come in and order hundreds of your books, but it's not real addresses, and then we have to go refund it back to these cards, and we call the credit card companies, and it's basically government credit cards.
[02:16:41.884 --> 02:16:43.145]  And, I mean, this is bizarre.
[02:16:43.485 --> 02:16:46.106]  Buddy, this is happening every day.
[02:16:46.646 --> 02:16:49.987]  Someone does, and then there's others with fake addresses and all this stuff.
[02:16:50.307 --> 02:16:51.768]  Someone is scared to death of your book.
[02:16:51.828 --> 02:16:53.068]  We've never had this happen with a product.
[02:16:53.389 --> 02:17:00.371]  Well, my book right now, 9-11 Synthetic Terror Made in USA, on many of the Internet websites, is the best seller on 9-11.
[02:17:00.431 --> 02:17:03.192]  I know on Amazon I'm beating the official version.
[02:17:03.232 --> 02:17:04.373]  I'm beating the rest of them.
[02:17:04.393 --> 02:17:05.953]  And I think this is important.
[02:17:05.993 --> 02:17:07.654]  It shows a radicalization of opinion.
[02:17:07.734 --> 02:17:10.495]  My book represents invisible government myopic.
[02:17:10.874 --> 02:17:18.077]  And I think of the ones that were written originally in English, I have to say, I think it does this more thoroughly, more consistently than anybody else.
[02:17:18.097 --> 02:17:26.120]  But what do they think they're going to do, like we're dumb and going to mail these out into the stratosphere?
[02:17:26.280 --> 02:17:30.602]  The government's openly trying to pay me to just ship your books into a black hole.
[02:17:31.762 --> 02:17:35.844]  Well, I'm flattered by so much attention, and I think it has to do with the fact that I represent
[02:17:36.544 --> 02:17:40.685]  The strongest version of my hop that you can get on the... Explain what my hop is.
[02:17:40.745 --> 02:17:41.926]  My hop is when we get back.
[02:17:42.246 --> 02:17:42.946]  We'll be right back.
[02:17:43.146 --> 02:17:43.706]  Stay with us.
[02:17:45.787 --> 02:17:47.867]  Gee, honey, those new sandals look great on you.
[02:17:48.068 --> 02:17:50.308]  And look, they show off my new toenails, too.
[02:17:50.608 --> 02:17:51.288]  New toenails?
[02:17:51.669 --> 02:17:52.649]  What happened to the old ones?
[02:17:53.629 --> 02:17:56.290]  Well, they're not really new, just clear and healthy looking.
[02:17:56.843 --> 02:17:58.264]  Remember how embarrassed I was?
[02:17:58.284 --> 02:18:01.085]  They were so discolored, really awful looking.
[02:18:01.305 --> 02:18:02.685]  Well, they sure look clear now.
[02:18:03.125 --> 02:18:04.806]  Gosh, I wish I could wear sandals again.
[02:18:04.966 --> 02:18:06.326]  My toenails are a disaster.
[02:18:06.366 --> 02:18:09.167]  Look, this one looks white, and that one's thick and yellow.
[02:18:09.187 --> 02:18:10.608]  Well, here's my secret.
[02:18:11.195 --> 02:18:12.236]  Non-X Nail Gel.
[02:18:12.717 --> 02:18:16.800]  It clears out yellowing keratin debris, the source of nail discoloration.
[02:18:17.501 --> 02:18:18.402]  Ah, so that's it.
[02:18:18.662 --> 02:18:21.204]  I've got ugly keratin debris built up under my nails.
[02:18:21.484 --> 02:18:23.126]  And Non-X Nail Gel gets rid of it.
[02:18:23.146 --> 02:18:26.649]  Now, you'll need to use it every day, but clear nails are worth it.
[02:18:27.069 --> 02:18:27.629]  You bet.
[02:18:27.849 --> 02:18:31.931]  You know, when we go to the beach this summer, my toenails are going to look just as good as yours do.
[02:18:31.951 --> 02:18:33.651]  Thanks to Nonex Nail Gel.
[02:18:34.031 --> 02:18:35.172]  Nonex Nail Gel.
[02:18:35.332 --> 02:18:37.012]  For clear, healthy-looking nails.
[02:18:37.372 --> 02:18:42.474]  Now at Walgreens, Rite Aid, Eckerd, Brooks, Longs, Duane Reade, and Walmart.
[02:18:42.654 --> 02:18:43.755]  In the foot care section.
[02:18:50.957 --> 02:18:53.078]  Currency, devaluation, inflation.
[02:18:53.518 --> 02:18:54.158]  One and the same.
[02:18:54.955 --> 02:19:04.798]  If you had deposited $100,000 in a bank at 1% in a 30-month period dating from May 24, 2005, here is what happened to your funds.
[02:19:05.218 --> 02:19:08.340]  The dollar lost 33% of its value in that time frame.
[02:19:08.600 --> 02:19:10.020]  The bank paid you 1%.
[02:19:10.280 --> 02:19:13.521]  Your $100,000 now has a net purchasing power of $68,000.
[02:19:14.061 --> 02:19:16.282]  Here is reality.
[02:19:16.642 --> 02:19:20.244]  The devaluation of currency equals real inflation.
[02:19:20.724 --> 02:19:24.325]  Keep in mind how the value of your paper assets are measured in dollars.
[02:19:24.935 --> 02:19:25.315]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:19:45.654 --> 02:19:48.036]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:19:48.637 --> 02:19:54.482]  Did you know that the mother of all secret societies, the Illuminati, worships Lucifer, better known as Satan the devil?
[02:19:55.423 --> 02:20:02.128]  Did you know that they are the individuals giving rise to the final world social system described in Revelation chapter 13?
[02:20:03.664 --> 02:20:08.366]  Did you know they were the founders of international communism to be the seen enemy of Christianity?
[02:20:08.886 --> 02:20:14.308]  To be used to destroy America so that we could be merged into an all-powerful one-world government?
[02:20:15.409 --> 02:20:23.692]  We would like to help you understand how these things are coming to pass by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[02:20:47.051 --> 02:20:48.092]  The war on terrorism.
[02:20:48.413 --> 02:20:51.196]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[02:20:51.476 --> 02:20:55.621]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[02:20:56.062 --> 02:20:56.883]  So what do you do?
[02:20:57.203 --> 02:21:01.769]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[02:21:02.250 --> 02:21:04.371]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[02:21:04.871 --> 02:21:19.577]  Sheltering in Place, surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[02:21:19.617 --> 02:21:26.719]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.

[02:21:46.109 --> 02:21:48.891]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[02:21:48.911 --> 02:21:52.733]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:21:56.049 --> 02:21:57.171]  We're good to go.
[02:22:09.096 --> 02:22:09.956]  Welcome back.
[02:22:10.016 --> 02:22:12.217]  Final segment with Webster Griffin Tarverly.
[02:22:12.237 --> 02:22:16.698]  We have his book available right now at InfoWars.com.
[02:22:16.758 --> 02:22:22.039]  Available right now at InfoWars.com at the video and bookstore online.
[02:22:22.119 --> 02:22:29.400]  I certainly hope that you will come and go there and get it, and so we can ship it out to you and support what he's doing and also support what we're doing.
[02:22:29.420 --> 02:22:33.981]  I get my film, Road to Tyranny, Martial Law, Masters of Terror.
[02:22:34.001 --> 02:22:36.222]  Of course, Road to Tyranny was the first major film on 9-11.
[02:22:38.624 --> 02:22:43.651]  Many say it is still the best, but only 45 minutes of the almost three hours is on.
[02:22:45.462 --> 02:22:46.723]  9-11 itself.
[02:22:46.763 --> 02:22:48.384]  We spent 45 minutes on Oklahoma City.
[02:22:48.584 --> 02:22:50.925]  Total government operation, 100% proven.
[02:22:51.185 --> 02:22:53.827]  That's a 45 or 44-minute doc in and of itself.
[02:22:54.227 --> 02:22:57.549]  Then we spent a lot of other time on other admitted government-sponsored terror events.
[02:22:57.869 --> 02:23:01.391]  And then we show you what they're planning to set up in Road to Tyranny.
[02:23:01.831 --> 02:23:06.193]  And then, of course, martial law is mainly 9-11 and in the police state.
[02:23:06.654 --> 02:23:10.216]  And then Masters of Terror is a wider view of many other events and 9-11.
[02:23:11.136 --> 02:23:17.181]  So I hope that you will get all three of those films at Infowars.com or see them all right now online at PrisonPlanet.tv for members.
[02:23:18.262 --> 02:23:20.844]  Going back to Webster Tarpley, we don't have any more time to take calls.
[02:23:20.904 --> 02:23:21.725]  I'm sorry to all the callers.
[02:23:22.125 --> 02:23:25.869]  We've got Mr. Sheen coming on, Charlie Sheen, in the next segment.
[02:23:26.149 --> 02:23:32.474]  But in closing, in the last three or four minutes here, Webster, lay out what my hop is specifically.
[02:23:32.975 --> 02:23:37.138]  Well, you can see this in the New York Magazine article to some extent.
[02:23:37.158 --> 02:23:38.859]  I think there are probably four schools of thought on 9-11.
[02:23:39.992 --> 02:23:43.894]  One is the Kane-Hamilton-Zelikow Official 9-11 Commission.
[02:23:44.055 --> 02:23:45.075]  It's, of course, a fraud.
[02:23:45.115 --> 02:23:45.856]  It's a cover-up.
[02:23:45.956 --> 02:23:46.976]  It's a tissue of lies.
[02:23:47.477 --> 02:23:50.458]  Worse than the Warren Commission, and they say it was a failure of imagination.
[02:23:50.518 --> 02:23:51.319]  Well, so much for them.
[02:23:51.899 --> 02:23:58.924]  Then we have the unanswered questions position, the incompetence, negligence, also not wearing well as time goes on.
[02:23:59.484 --> 02:24:02.045]  Then we have LIHOP, Let It Happen On Purpose.
[02:24:02.125 --> 02:24:06.288]  This assumes that bin Laden, al-Qaeda, all of this is real, independent action.
[02:24:06.867 --> 02:24:10.369]  And the guilt of the people involved is to pull down the U.S.
[02:24:10.389 --> 02:24:15.172]  defenses, paralyze the air defense, and the problem with that is it just doesn't hold up.
[02:24:15.232 --> 02:24:19.775]  I would say Crossing the Rubicon by Mike Ruppert is an example of the LIHOP theory.
[02:24:19.835 --> 02:24:21.856]  Again, it's not wearing well as time goes on.
[02:24:21.876 --> 02:24:26.059]  Yeah, it's, I mean, I just, I'm not going to say anything about that individual.
[02:24:26.159 --> 02:24:29.301]  Okay, so then we have MIHOP, the Made It Happen On Purpose.
[02:24:29.821 --> 02:24:30.422]  This is that...
[02:24:31.458 --> 02:24:33.979]  I would argue invisible government myhop.
[02:24:34.019 --> 02:24:37.720]  It says that Atta, Bin Laden, Al Qaeda, these are controlled patsies.
[02:24:37.780 --> 02:24:39.720]  They're versions of Oswald.
[02:24:40.300 --> 02:24:44.001]  But you see, I believe the only thing that's possible is the last.
[02:24:44.281 --> 02:24:46.102]  Didn't make it happen, did it?
[02:24:46.902 --> 02:24:47.682]  Well, made it happen.
[02:24:47.722 --> 02:24:50.403]  The patsies are one thing.
[02:24:50.443 --> 02:24:51.423]  They don't make it happen.
[02:24:51.503 --> 02:24:57.164]  It's actually the trained professionals using government resources under the cover of war drills and terror drills.
[02:24:57.204 --> 02:24:58.345]  That's how they make it happen.
[02:24:58.405 --> 02:24:59.945]  Under the cover of Amalgam Virgo...
[02:25:00.649 --> 02:25:22.056]  The National Reconnaissance Office crashing planes into building drill... And the old Stone Age version of that is Marinus van der Lubbe, the Dutch individual, mentally retarded, flopping around naked, drugged in the back of the Reichstag in the alley, and then meanwhile it's admitted that Goering has 50 stormtroopers running around with giant canisters of petrol burning the place down.
[02:25:22.536 --> 02:25:25.097]  Right, and I think that's... He's an example of a patsy.
[02:25:25.117 --> 02:25:25.497]  Then you have...
[02:25:25.925 --> 02:25:35.673]  Some of the books on 9-11 tend to, for example, David Ray Griffin treats individual cases within a MIHOP mentality, with a MIHOP analysis.
[02:25:35.713 --> 02:25:42.818]  But as far as I know, he does not rise to the level of saying 9-11 was a massive provocation by the invisible government.
[02:25:42.899 --> 02:25:46.341]  Hey, Webster, I went on CNN last night and said they did it.
[02:25:46.361 --> 02:25:48.003]  Do you think the White House heard about that?
[02:25:48.023 --> 02:25:48.943]  I hope so.
[02:25:50.575 --> 02:25:57.041]  I hope, above all, that lots of other people heard about it, because I think we're on the verge of having this entire thing blow open.
[02:25:57.181 --> 02:25:58.883]  Do you think that makes me safer?
[02:25:59.123 --> 02:26:00.965]  I mean, being the most prominent?
[02:26:01.085 --> 02:26:02.786]  Do you think it makes me in greater danger?
[02:26:03.067 --> 02:26:10.473]  There's something called factitious advantage, which is that the more that you're identified with this issue, the more the political price is for doing anything against you.
[02:26:10.513 --> 02:26:12.675]  So I urge everybody, move forward.
[02:26:12.695 --> 02:26:13.136]  You don't have...
[02:26:14.117 --> 02:26:19.661]  By the way, our media says that Hugo Chavez claims they've tried to kill him.
[02:26:19.901 --> 02:26:29.528]  They have kidnapped him, had him on a helicopter saying, we're going to throw you out of it, and then his troops took back over, and so their coup backfired minutes before they were going to kill him.
[02:26:29.868 --> 02:26:31.650]  Our government has said they're going to kill him.
[02:26:31.710 --> 02:26:38.415]  Pat Robertson's on air saying, kill him, and our media calls it a conspiracy theory that there's an attempt to kill Hugo Chavez.
[02:26:38.975 --> 02:26:42.997]  Well, if you're having a tank attack, you don't get to the middle of the field and stop the tanks.
[02:26:43.017 --> 02:26:47.319]  You've got to keep the tanks going, and that's what I urge you and everybody else to do.
[02:26:47.379 --> 02:26:53.922]  Well, sir, I went, I mean, four and a half, five years ago, before 9-11, I'd already gone to the point of no return.
[02:26:53.962 --> 02:26:55.303]  I'm not turning around.
[02:26:55.803 --> 02:27:00.506]  I just, it's still, I mean, the hair on the back of my neck was standing up when I was on CNN.
[02:27:00.906 --> 02:27:03.067]  I mean, here I am just absolutely engaging.
[02:27:03.127 --> 02:27:07.269]  I'm 110% at point-blank range, you know, just laying it out.
[02:27:08.338 --> 02:27:09.380]  More power to you, Alex.
[02:27:09.760 --> 02:27:10.380]  Keep it going.
[02:27:10.401 --> 02:27:16.507]  Hey, good to hear from you at Webster, and I'm glad there's folks out there like you to carry the torch, regardless of what happens and goes on.
[02:27:16.547 --> 02:27:19.550]  I just have a chill going up my spine right now.
[02:27:19.570 --> 02:27:20.831]  Thanks for the call.
[02:27:21.532 --> 02:27:21.832]  You bet.
[02:27:21.872 --> 02:27:22.192]  Thank you.
[02:27:22.212 --> 02:27:22.833]  Thanks for joining us.
[02:27:23.133 --> 02:27:24.595]  Well, guess who's online with us?
[02:27:25.235 --> 02:27:27.057]  Guess who's coming up after this quick break?
[02:27:27.557 --> 02:27:30.881]  A real American hero, Charlie Sheen.
[02:27:31.561 --> 02:27:32.142]  Stay with us.
[02:27:35.979 --> 02:27:36.881]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.382 --> 02:27:38.965]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.906 --> 02:27:42.591]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:45.697 --> 02:27:46.117]  We're good to go.
[02:28:10.279 --> 02:28:28.526]  The filter mag is a powerful magnet that holds itself to the outside of your oil filter, trapping the tiny metal particles to the inside wall of the filter, extending the life of your oil and ultimately extending the life of your engine.
[02:28:28.766 --> 02:28:33.190]  The reusable FilterMag is maintenance-free, installed in two seconds, and lasts forever.
[02:28:33.411 --> 02:28:34.351]  So what are you waiting for?
[02:28:34.532 --> 02:28:36.153]  Go to FilterMag.com.
[02:28:36.293 --> 02:28:38.075]  That's FilterMag.com.
[02:28:38.335 --> 02:28:38.816]  Or call 800-345-8376.
[02:28:38.856 --> 02:28:39.036]  That's 800-345-8376.
[02:28:46.095 --> 02:28:47.716]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:28:47.856 --> 02:28:51.958]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[02:28:52.098 --> 02:28:54.980]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[02:28:55.060 --> 02:29:01.743]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[02:29:01.943 --> 02:29:04.947]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[02:29:05.167 --> 02:29:07.549]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[02:29:07.690 --> 02:29:17.821]  Like murky elements, not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as atrazine, benzene, chloride, and chloroform.
[02:29:17.921 --> 02:29:18.521]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:29:18.541 --> 02:29:18.962]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:29:18.982 --> 02:29:20.522]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[02:29:46.056 --> 02:29:50.140]  If the cost of your prescriptions are getting out of control, you want to listen carefully to this.
[02:29:50.420 --> 02:29:58.206]  RxDrugCard.com is a simple, innovative program designed to give individuals the same purchasing power as large HMOs and insurance companies.

[02:30:08.575 --> 02:30:12.238]  Don't risk ruining your health by using cheap, counterfeit foreign drugs.
[02:30:12.318 --> 02:30:12.718]  We're good to go.
[02:30:29.226 --> 02:30:29.707]  That's 888-216-2461.
[02:31:00.126 --> 02:31:06.268]  You can go to CNN right now via prisonplanet.com or infowars.com.
[02:31:06.308 --> 02:31:07.429]  It's one of the top stories.
[02:31:08.369 --> 02:31:11.230]  Our headline is 82% agree with Charlie Sheen.
[02:31:11.470 --> 02:31:11.790]  The U.S.
[02:31:11.830 --> 02:31:13.291]  government covered up the real events of 9-11.
[02:31:15.018 --> 02:31:17.220]  And it's gyrating between 84% and 82%.
[02:31:17.920 --> 02:31:22.484]  I looked at it five minutes ago, or a few minutes ago, and it said 84%.
[02:31:22.564 --> 02:31:23.205]  Now it's down to 82%.
[02:31:24.405 --> 02:31:26.107]  And I haven't really been pushing you to go vote on it.
[02:31:26.547 --> 02:31:29.890]  And I've been told, we've confirmed, the calls come into the studio and the emails.
[02:31:30.250 --> 02:31:35.034]  Neocons are on talk radio all over the country panicking over this poll.
[02:31:36.375 --> 02:31:39.217]  And they are telling people to go there and to vote.
[02:31:39.878 --> 02:31:41.579]  And so we're out of 18,605 votes...
[02:31:44.855 --> 02:31:49.746]  15,328 agree with Charlie Sheen, and 3,277 agree with the official, the tooth fairy did it, government conspiracy fairy.
[02:31:56.602 --> 02:32:01.866]  So, since they're on there saying, go vote, go vote against Charlie, we just said, vote your conscience.
[02:32:02.106 --> 02:32:03.047]  Go vote for Charlie.
[02:32:03.327 --> 02:32:06.029]  Go to PrisonPlanet.com before they close this poll and do it right now.
[02:32:06.390 --> 02:32:14.876]  In fact, they had a big online poll with the Atlanta Journal-Constitution three years ago when Congresswoman Cynthia McKinney went public and said, 9-11 is a clear cover-up.
[02:32:15.216 --> 02:32:16.578]  We need a real investigation.
[02:32:17.318 --> 02:32:19.980]  And she listed NORAD stand down and public officials being warned.
[02:32:20.000 --> 02:32:23.403]  And, of course, we've interviewed her on the radio show and on TV today.
[02:32:24.182 --> 02:32:37.413]  And it was a 24-hour poll, and 90-plus percent were agreeing with her until Neil Bortz, who's based in Atlanta, and a bunch of other people said, go tell her she's crazy, say she's wrong.
[02:32:37.753 --> 02:32:40.475]  And when they closed the poll, it had gone down to 45 percent.
[02:32:40.495 --> 02:32:48.642]  It went back up to 55, and they shut it down because even with national attacks going, the people were going to really show that we had the majority view.
[02:32:48.882 --> 02:32:51.284]  That was three years ago, over three years ago now.
[02:32:52.225 --> 02:32:58.876]  CNN last year had a poll on Anderson Cooper the exact same type of poll and out of tens of thousands of respondents we have links to that on the website.
[02:32:59.677 --> 02:33:04.881]  Understand that it closed at 90% believing the government was covering up and may have been involved.
[02:33:05.222 --> 02:33:08.484]  Zogby, 49% believed the government could be involved.
[02:33:08.505 --> 02:33:11.907]  66% wanted a new investigation and thought they were being lied to.
[02:33:12.688 --> 02:33:20.635]  So Charlie Sheen being attacked by hundreds of newspapers and magazines and it's backfiring on them.
[02:33:20.655 --> 02:33:25.599]  He's also being supported by, I would say about 45% of them are being supportive.
[02:33:26.099 --> 02:33:29.802]  And even the hit pieces then, I think, are people falling down on purpose.
[02:33:30.282 --> 02:33:33.084]  In fact, some of them I've talked to and I know, but they're not allowed to tell the truth.
[02:33:33.104 --> 02:33:34.385]  So they say, isn't he an idiot?
[02:33:34.745 --> 02:33:37.467]  And then they list, look at all these top government people that say what he says.
[02:33:37.507 --> 02:33:38.507]  Aren't they dumb too?
[02:33:39.188 --> 02:33:42.410]  So I believe people are deliberately doing all they can to actually help Charlie.
[02:33:42.990 --> 02:33:45.392]  And listen, he's the first person in Hollywood to go public.
[02:33:45.412 --> 02:33:46.513]  He's an American citizen.
[02:33:46.773 --> 02:33:48.754]  He's well informed and educated on these subjects.
[02:33:49.155 --> 02:33:50.075]  I know you want to hear from him.
[02:33:50.155 --> 02:33:53.057]  I'm just telling you, he's got amazing courage and I'm commending him.
[02:33:53.597 --> 02:33:55.799]  Charlie, thank you so much for coming on with us, Mr. Sheen.
[02:33:56.259 --> 02:33:57.721]  Thanks for having me back, Alex.
[02:33:59.322 --> 02:34:01.084]  All I can say is, wow.
[02:34:02.065 --> 02:34:02.345]  Wow.
[02:34:02.566 --> 02:34:06.690]  This has been some kind of week, I'll tell you.
[02:34:10.273 --> 02:34:14.097]  I had a sense that this thing was going to get hot.
[02:34:15.759 --> 02:34:18.702]  I didn't realize that, as you say, it was going to go supernovae.
[02:34:20.618 --> 02:34:26.141]  Well, it has gone supernova, despite the fact they tried to can it the first few days, but they just couldn't stop it.
[02:34:26.702 --> 02:34:27.422]  No, they could not.
[02:34:27.562 --> 02:34:28.062]  They could not.
[02:34:28.102 --> 02:34:33.386]  But it's interesting, because you talk about this recent poll, which is really inspiring.
[02:34:33.586 --> 02:34:39.329]  Can you specifically speak to CNN, Showbiz, Tonight, and their poll?
[02:34:40.590 --> 02:34:45.412]  Well, gosh, first of all, I have to tip my hat to CNN, to Showbiz Tonight, to A.J.
[02:34:45.453 --> 02:34:49.675]  Hammer, for having the courage, for having the guts, for having the wherewithal to
[02:34:50.433 --> 02:34:58.837]  To give someone like myself, someone like you, the actual time and the focus to examine these issues.
[02:34:59.477 --> 02:35:05.480]  Because as you said, I think this is the most attention in mainstream coverage that this topic has ever received.
[02:35:06.860 --> 02:35:07.141]  It is.
[02:35:07.221 --> 02:35:12.203]  I mean, no one has ever had in Hollywood the courage you had, and then that spurred more courage.
[02:35:12.543 --> 02:35:13.063]  And A.J.
[02:35:13.103 --> 02:35:16.005]  Hammer says he thinks there's a cover-up and he wants an investigation.
[02:35:17.685 --> 02:35:18.566]  Well, yeah, and that's...
[02:35:19.528 --> 02:35:22.630]  That says a lot about him, sticking his neck out there, you know?
[02:35:24.451 --> 02:35:31.695]  But again, like we said in the first interview, it feels like the worm is turning, that the consciousness is shifting.
[02:35:33.436 --> 02:35:38.519]  But it's interesting because you talk about the attack pieces, you know, and the majority of them, in fact 90% of them,
[02:35:40.345 --> 02:35:41.946]  We're attacking me personally.
[02:35:41.986 --> 02:35:43.646]  We're attacking my credibility.
[02:35:43.686 --> 02:35:51.589]  We're attacking my observational or talents of insight or observance.
[02:35:51.810 --> 02:36:02.934]  And what they did not attack is the specific points that you and I raised, the points that generate the most controversy about the events.
[02:36:04.261 --> 02:36:08.627]  Well, that's what a hit piece, if it's done by an operative, always is.
[02:36:08.647 --> 02:36:15.576]  They build a straw man, and most of the stuff they're attacking you on is exaggerated or isn't even true, because I've researched it.
[02:36:16.117 --> 02:36:17.298]  It's tabloid trash.
[02:36:17.318 --> 02:36:17.759]  80% of it's a fraud.
[02:36:19.501 --> 02:36:35.878]  And then, I mean, I love him as, I mean, as for being a party animal, George Bush is known to be a bigger partier than you are in many cases in his life, so I guess it's okay that George Bush has got a few problems in his life, but you've got to be basically Jesus Christ.
[02:36:36.952 --> 02:36:37.673]  Well, absolutely.
[02:36:37.733 --> 02:36:50.070]  For anyone to have any kind of an opinion about something that warrants opinion, I guess you have to be as squeaky clean as all of those offering their critique.
[02:36:51.632 --> 02:36:52.934]  You're absolutely right about that, but...
[02:36:54.577 --> 02:37:00.980]  I'm listening to talk shows, and I'm listening to the callers call in, and they're predominantly agreeing with you, and their neocon hosts are flipping out.
[02:37:01.380 --> 02:37:03.381]  And then, I mean, what does this poll mean to you?
[02:37:03.401 --> 02:37:09.943]  Specifically, you know, in the low 80s, 80-plus percent, more than 8 out of 10 people agree with Charlie Sheen.
[02:37:09.983 --> 02:37:12.084]  Can you speak directly to that, those type of numbers?
[02:37:13.105 --> 02:37:14.405]  Well, those numbers are staggering.
[02:37:15.306 --> 02:37:20.048]  But again, I'm not entirely surprised, because...
[02:37:21.420 --> 02:37:24.261]  I didn't blindly go on your show on Monday.
[02:37:24.361 --> 02:37:25.262]  I did my research.
[02:37:25.422 --> 02:37:37.667]  I was looking at those numbers that you referenced earlier, and so I felt like if I was going to have the guts to come out about this, that there would be some support.
[02:37:37.707 --> 02:37:40.329]  There would be a strong measure of support.
[02:37:42.730 --> 02:37:50.013]  I think it speaks volumes to the reality that people want the truth.
[02:37:50.842 --> 02:37:52.122]  They want the truth.
[02:37:52.582 --> 02:37:57.644]  And what's been offered to us resembles nothing of the sort.
[02:37:58.384 --> 02:38:02.745]  Well, on top of it, Charlie, the old line media still thinks they have a monopoly.
[02:38:03.025 --> 02:38:14.428]  They don't understand that overall the alternative media is now bigger and that they're not just going to be able to mug you and then everybody just sit back and watch them beat you up.
[02:38:16.092 --> 02:38:17.633]  Yeah, well, clearly.
[02:38:20.395 --> 02:38:26.340]  There were a lot of blogs, and there were a lot of chat boards, and there were a lot of Internet data.
[02:38:27.440 --> 02:38:33.805]  There were a lot of people I wanted to respond to personally for their support and their courage to join.
[02:38:37.210 --> 02:38:39.991]  Those of us that are part of the 9-11 Truth Movement.
[02:38:40.031 --> 02:38:42.131]  Well, I want people to understand something, too.
[02:38:42.271 --> 02:38:59.014]  I mean, when I call you or you call me or I'm calling you back and you answer the phone and I hear the newest 9-11 documentary on in the background or I hear you online researching something, listening to firefighter tapes where they're saying there's bombs in the buildings, you've been researching this for how many years?
[02:38:59.074 --> 02:39:03.295]  I mean, again, I'm not just saying you are hyper, super informed on this.
[02:39:04.215 --> 02:39:04.915]  That's true.
[02:39:04.995 --> 02:39:05.855]  I mean, you really are.
[02:39:06.767 --> 02:39:07.607]  Well, thank you, Alex.
[02:39:07.647 --> 02:39:11.888]  No, but it's not like I have access to any secret data.
[02:39:12.528 --> 02:39:20.470]  I'm looking at the evidence and the data that is available, that is available for anyone to look at if they know where to look, if they know how to look.
[02:39:20.750 --> 02:39:22.910]  And, you know, it takes a lot of filtering.
[02:39:22.950 --> 02:39:23.991]  It takes a lot of sifting.
[02:39:24.051 --> 02:39:30.292]  But if you do your research and you're diligent, there's stuff that will be uncovered that...
[02:39:31.932 --> 02:39:33.514]  You just can't turn away from it.
[02:39:33.534 --> 02:39:34.815]  You cannot ignore it.
[02:39:35.076 --> 02:39:38.640]  How many hours a week have you been researching 9-11?
[02:39:40.902 --> 02:39:48.030]  I'd be guessing, but it didn't really begin until about six months after the actual event.
[02:39:48.050 --> 02:39:48.731]  I was vilified.
[02:39:52.594 --> 02:39:55.895]  For expressing my feelings about what I saw.
[02:39:56.315 --> 02:40:02.757]  And I was demonized about expressing or for expressing my gut reaction to what I saw.
[02:40:02.817 --> 02:40:04.197]  So again... That's right.
[02:40:04.277 --> 02:40:06.277]  They ignored the meat and potatoes.
[02:40:06.317 --> 02:40:13.559]  They ignored whenever you came right out with the facts and then they tried to focus just in on you talking about that day or instincts.
[02:40:14.019 --> 02:40:14.539]  Exactly.
[02:40:14.579 --> 02:40:20.381]  Which was a mistake and it was a valuable lesson not to talk about gut instinct because...
[02:40:21.658 --> 02:40:25.207]  You know, these times have obviously...
[02:40:26.657 --> 02:40:35.219]  But the good idea is they're not willing to face you on the real meat and potatoes issues.
[02:40:35.259 --> 02:40:44.481]  And what you've done is going to drive tens of millions more people to go out and simply look directly at the points that you've raised.
[02:40:44.761 --> 02:40:46.541]  And let's spend a little bit of time on that.
[02:40:47.061 --> 02:40:48.502]  Sure.
[02:40:48.522 --> 02:40:48.882]  9-11, Building 7.
[02:40:48.942 --> 02:40:49.302]  Sure.
[02:40:50.102 --> 02:40:54.343]  I mean, would you like to challenge these neocons to specifically put up or shut up?
[02:40:54.363 --> 02:40:55.303]  I mean, what about this lady...
[02:40:56.098 --> 02:41:03.401]  Who we now find out the production company she works for is owned by one of Bush's fraternity brothers from Skull and Bones.
[02:41:03.541 --> 02:41:11.804]  She went on TV on CNN and told us that we needed to do more research, and she claimed that the planes knocked the fire retardant off the steel.
[02:41:11.864 --> 02:41:16.465]  Even if they did, steel doesn't melt at that temperature, and Building 7 wasn't hit by a plane.
[02:41:17.446 --> 02:41:19.846]  Yeah, no, it wasn't hit by debris.
[02:41:19.866 --> 02:41:24.128]  It wasn't... There was no obvious damage other than...
[02:41:24.853 --> 02:41:29.276]  A few ascribed small fires that burn for five to six hours.
[02:41:30.557 --> 02:41:37.282]  No, but this woman based all of her credibility on the ratings that the show received.
[02:41:37.742 --> 02:41:41.945]  And I find that ludicrous because what that speaks to is people's interest.
[02:41:42.742 --> 02:41:43.602]  Well, right now...
[02:42:03.072 --> 02:42:04.253]  To my comments this week.
[02:42:04.313 --> 02:42:08.556]  Well, that obviously shows that a lot of people believe me, but I'm not saying that.
[02:42:08.596 --> 02:42:28.248]  I'm just here to remind people that the only credibility I need is what I have, and that is as an upstanding, tax-paying American citizen who loves his country and who refuses to stand by as this level of insanity is blanketed on
[02:42:33.161 --> 02:42:35.862]  Over obvious truths.
[02:42:36.602 --> 02:42:45.865]  Well, you know, an area we haven't really explored is motive for the trillions in oil, motives for the hundreds of billions of no-bid weapons contracts.
[02:42:45.925 --> 02:42:52.587]  And Bush told his biographer to be able to have a war, then no one could really question him domestically.
[02:42:52.987 --> 02:42:56.188]  And to have that war, Dick Cheney wrote in the PNAC documents...
[02:42:56.448 --> 02:42:57.408]  Well, it just seems too convenient.
[02:43:21.357 --> 02:43:25.219]  The path that we've been led down since the event.
[02:43:25.599 --> 02:43:34.143]  Again, I cannot speak about the why, the how, the who, because I do not have any evidence that points in any of those directions.
[02:43:34.623 --> 02:43:35.204]  You know what I'm saying?
[02:43:35.224 --> 02:43:41.166]  I mean, yes, I'm aware of the times that we're living in.
[02:43:41.667 --> 02:43:43.908]  I'm aware of civil liberties and...
[02:43:45.307 --> 02:43:45.847]  We're good to go.
[02:43:45.867 --> 02:43:46.168]  I think?
[02:44:03.388 --> 02:44:07.891]  The most questions, I think that's where our argument stands.
[02:44:07.971 --> 02:44:13.594]  So we're getting back to what you said on Monday, and I'd like you to say it again in your own words or add to it.
[02:44:13.894 --> 02:44:23.360]  Their official story is the biggest conspiracy theory of them all, and we know what they're telling us about 9-11 from pillar to post is a fraud.
[02:44:23.720 --> 02:44:26.841]  So, therefore, I mean, if Building 7's wrong, it's all wrong.
[02:44:27.102 --> 02:44:27.602]  Speak to that.
[02:44:28.479 --> 02:44:29.600]  Well, it's like I said on Monday.
[02:44:29.640 --> 02:44:33.662]  If there's a problem with Building 7, there's a problem with the whole damn thing.
[02:44:33.702 --> 02:44:34.282]  And guess what?
[02:44:34.822 --> 02:44:37.464]  There is a serious problem with Building 7.
[02:44:37.804 --> 02:44:42.506]  Now, you say you've tried to contact Larry Silverstein, correct?
[02:44:42.566 --> 02:44:42.826]  Yes.
[02:44:43.246 --> 02:44:44.707]  And he will not return your call?
[02:44:44.987 --> 02:44:45.207]  No.
[02:44:45.608 --> 02:44:50.250]  And he will not respond to his quote about pulling Building 7?
[02:44:50.310 --> 02:44:50.430]  No.
[02:44:54.028 --> 02:44:56.390]  How is that possible?
[02:44:56.470 --> 02:44:58.492]  How is that justifiable?
[02:44:59.573 --> 02:45:05.759]  When somebody makes a statement like that, I think it warrants a follow-up response.
[02:45:07.700 --> 02:45:08.281]  Well, it does.
[02:45:08.301 --> 02:45:09.082]  You know what?
[02:45:09.202 --> 02:45:16.008]  I'll come right out and say that I'm personally requesting a direct answer from Mr. Silverstein about what he meant.
[02:45:16.028 --> 02:45:20.312]  Because so far, none of us have been able to get it.
[02:45:20.842 --> 02:45:22.484]  Well, that's extremely bold of you.
[02:45:22.504 --> 02:45:24.466]  Give them my number.
[02:45:24.586 --> 02:45:25.327]  Tell them to call me.
[02:45:25.387 --> 02:45:26.268]  I'm just curious.
[02:45:26.489 --> 02:45:27.490]  Tell them to call CNN.
[02:45:27.510 --> 02:45:28.571]  Tell them to call somebody.
[02:45:29.212 --> 02:45:32.556]  Because you cannot make a statement like that and not follow it up.
[02:45:33.482 --> 02:45:35.603]  And not back it up, and not explain it.
[02:45:36.103 --> 02:45:38.144]  Well, let's be specific about that.
[02:45:39.005 --> 02:45:41.206]  Obviously, you've seen the films, you've seen the news footage.
[02:45:41.586 --> 02:45:44.848]  There are clear blast points going off down the sides.
[02:45:44.888 --> 02:45:51.711]  You see the central column get blown, you see the penthouse cave in, the perfect classical demolition, and it falls in on its own footprint.
[02:45:51.731 --> 02:45:54.953]  Can you specifically talk about the video you've seen and those blast points?
[02:45:56.014 --> 02:46:09.207]  Anyone that cannot view this as a controlled demolition, I would have to say that their chair was not facing the television.
[02:46:09.968 --> 02:46:20.258]  Anyone that can look at this and say, yes, that is a random event caused by fire, really needs psychiatric evaluation.
[02:46:21.334 --> 02:46:26.638]  Well, literally, folks, I have hours of different firefighters and police.
[02:46:26.658 --> 02:46:28.980]  I mean, we can't put it all in the films because that's all the films would be.
[02:46:29.480 --> 02:46:32.042]  We have hours of them saying, did you see the bombs?
[02:46:32.062 --> 02:46:33.183]  Did you see the explosions?
[02:46:33.963 --> 02:46:37.086]  And then reporters when 7 falls going, wow, did you hear those explosions?
[02:46:37.126 --> 02:46:37.906]  And then it falls.
[02:46:38.447 --> 02:46:40.788]  I mean, hours and hours and hours and hours.
[02:46:41.209 --> 02:46:44.051]  And Dan Rather and Peter Jennings saying, looks like bombs.
[02:46:44.671 --> 02:46:47.433]  All of this, and then a modern steel building never falling.
[02:46:48.194 --> 02:46:49.535]  I mean, this cannot be ignored.
[02:46:49.955 --> 02:47:01.642]  But when they pigeonhole me into the tinfoil hat-wearing conspiracy knucklehead brigade, they don't mention those quotes by Peter Jennings and Dan Rather.
[02:47:02.862 --> 02:47:04.023]  They don't mention the quotes?
[02:47:04.603 --> 02:47:06.465]  But that was their first impression.
[02:47:06.525 --> 02:47:08.526]  That was their gut reaction.
[02:47:08.546 --> 02:47:10.187]  You see what I'm saying?
[02:47:10.207 --> 02:47:11.087]  They didn't have any evidence.
[02:47:11.107 --> 02:47:12.008]  They didn't have any proof.
[02:47:12.928 --> 02:47:14.109]  They were observing exactly...
[02:47:15.147 --> 02:47:19.533]  They were commenting on what they were observing at that specific moment in time.
[02:47:19.553 --> 02:47:21.956]  Absolutely.
[02:47:22.036 --> 02:47:26.802]  But again, Alex, the majority of what we're discussing existed only on day one.
[02:47:27.489 --> 02:47:34.112]  If there wasn't a problem with any of it, why wouldn't it still be accessible through the mainstream to this day?
[02:47:34.132 --> 02:47:36.333]  Yeah, why won't they talk about it and debate it with us?
[02:47:36.413 --> 02:47:40.674]  It's the big no-no.
[02:47:40.815 --> 02:47:41.875]  It's taboo.
[02:47:42.475 --> 02:47:51.899]  We're not supposed to get into Building 7 because not only did it look like a controlled demolition on the day, then the firefighting organizations and firefighter engineering say it's a cover-up.
[02:47:52.199 --> 02:47:53.120]  Fire didn't do that.
[02:47:53.200 --> 02:47:54.040]  That's impossible.
[02:47:54.100 --> 02:47:54.880]  They're the experts.
[02:47:54.920 --> 02:47:56.381]  They're the firefighter engineers.
[02:47:56.741 --> 02:47:58.642]  Not just firefighters, they're engineers.
[02:47:58.983 --> 02:48:00.103]  They're saying it's a cover-up.
[02:48:00.143 --> 02:48:04.707]  Then they haul the steel away, guarding it with machine guns to ship it to China.
[02:48:05.367 --> 02:48:06.108]  Let me ask you a question.
[02:48:06.148 --> 02:48:06.268]  Sure.
[02:48:06.488 --> 02:48:12.972]  What do you think of Communist China, a known Communist Chinese company, a military company taking over our port security now?
[02:48:14.353 --> 02:48:18.616]  Well, gosh, that would require an entirely separate interview for you and I to launch into.
[02:48:18.636 --> 02:48:20.778]  Yeah, that just broke the day.
[02:48:20.798 --> 02:48:21.438]  No, I saw that.
[02:48:21.478 --> 02:48:21.938]  I saw that.
[02:48:23.735 --> 02:48:24.295]  It's amazing.
[02:48:24.315 --> 02:48:25.976]  Charlie Sheen, final segment with you.
[02:48:25.996 --> 02:48:28.398]  We'll cover some other key issues on the other side.
[02:48:28.438 --> 02:48:33.040]  Again, I can only commend you for being just an amazing trailblazer.
[02:48:33.080 --> 02:48:40.884]  You have really made history on the side of the good guys in a big way, and I think what you've done here is more important than everything else you've done in your life, my friend.
[02:48:41.165 --> 02:48:43.366]  We'll be right back with Charlie Sheen, who's a hero.
[02:48:45.882 --> 02:48:52.724]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[02:48:53.024 --> 02:48:54.425]  That's right folks, DVD.
[02:48:54.605 --> 02:48:56.805]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[02:48:56.965 --> 02:48:59.046]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[02:48:59.326 --> 02:49:04.248]  If you want to wake up your friends and families to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[02:49:04.588 --> 02:49:08.629]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[02:49:08.869 --> 02:49:10.650]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[02:49:10.730 --> 02:49:21.375]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plannable microchips, and much, much more.
[02:49:21.515 --> 02:49:23.416]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[02:49:23.616 --> 02:49:27.458]  Order your copy on VHS or DVD today and man the guns of the Infowar.
[02:49:27.578 --> 02:49:29.019]  Order right now by calling 1-888-2533-139.

[02:49:36.082 --> 02:49:37.323]  Again, that number, 888-253-3139.
[02:49:45.507 --> 02:49:45.887]  Thank you.
[02:50:06.462 --> 02:50:13.308]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[02:50:13.368 --> 02:50:15.690]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5.

[02:51:24.472 --> 02:51:27.673]  Charlie and I were just talking during the break and he was saying
[02:51:54.366 --> 02:52:01.989]  I want to challenge these neocons to not attack me personally, but challenge me on the facts.
[02:52:02.550 --> 02:52:03.670]  You know, it's not about Charlie Sheen.
[02:52:03.710 --> 02:52:09.433]  And, Charlie, just for all the newspapers and CNN and everybody else out there listening, would you like to state that in your own words?
[02:52:10.313 --> 02:52:14.635]  Yeah, I just want to restate that I am a citizen that loves my country.
[02:52:15.895 --> 02:52:19.357]  And as a citizen, with my passion...
[02:52:22.697 --> 02:52:34.151]  For this great country, I demand that I be challenged on the facts, not on immature behavior from 20 years ago.
[02:52:34.171 --> 02:52:40.539]  That if they continue to attack me personally, it only gives credence to our side of the argument.
[02:52:41.107 --> 02:52:41.447]  That's right.
[02:52:41.487 --> 02:52:47.372]  I mean, you're here saying, hey, just look at these facts, like many other prominent people are doing, and that's the issue.
[02:52:48.833 --> 02:52:54.777]  You also have another idea about new media polls you're challenging the media to carry out.
[02:52:54.817 --> 02:52:56.639]  Well, I think there should be a poll on Building 7.
[02:52:57.614 --> 02:53:01.195]  First of all, ask people if they even know what Building 7 is, or was, rather.
[02:53:01.215 --> 02:53:07.558]  And then ask them, having seen the video evidence, what their opinion is.
[02:53:08.018 --> 02:53:09.319]  You know, that's a great point.
[02:53:09.419 --> 02:53:11.379]  I would predict right now it would be in the 90s.
[02:53:11.879 --> 02:53:12.940]  I'm on the record saying that.
[02:53:13.520 --> 02:53:15.541]  Do you believe Building 7 was a controlled demolition?
[02:53:15.561 --> 02:53:15.541]  90%.
[02:53:17.041 --> 02:53:17.762]  Okay, I said it.
[02:53:17.802 --> 02:53:18.282]  I'm on the record.
[02:53:19.207 --> 02:53:24.369]  Well, that's what I'm getting in the real poll of 4,000 radio interviews in the last four and a half years.
[02:53:25.349 --> 02:53:28.130]  Now, I think it'll be 90% of Americans who know about 7.
[02:53:28.690 --> 02:53:33.612]  The government media have been so quiet about it because you have a 47-story building, and I've been there, folks.
[02:53:33.652 --> 02:53:45.296]  It's way down the block, imploding and falling down when buildings right up next to Tower 1 and 2 that weren't owned by certain parties had buildings fall on them and burn for a day and nothing fell.
[02:53:45.736 --> 02:53:47.937]  Yeah, no, it's startling.
[02:53:49.022 --> 02:53:49.602]  It's startling.
[02:53:49.942 --> 02:54:02.468]  If we can take simple physics and every aspect of logic that we've come to know and just put it on its ear, then we can get behind how they've explained that away.
[02:54:03.068 --> 02:54:04.409]  What does FEMA say about Building 7, Alex?
[02:54:06.492 --> 02:54:10.395]  They've had four different stories, as you know, and they've had to change each one.
[02:54:10.935 --> 02:54:16.880]  First, it was an oil tank, and then they proved that didn't make it fall.
[02:54:17.200 --> 02:54:19.182]  And then they said, oh, well, fires.
[02:54:19.202 --> 02:54:20.643]  And they said, well, no, that's impossible.
[02:54:20.663 --> 02:54:23.405]  I mean, underwriting laboratories that underwrote it said it's impossible.
[02:54:23.965 --> 02:54:27.508]  And, I mean, those are engineers that underwrote it.
[02:54:27.548 --> 02:54:28.309]  You understand, folks.
[02:54:28.849 --> 02:54:30.671]  And then they claimed that the North...
[02:54:31.951 --> 02:54:37.713]  A North Tower fell, hit it, and knocked out its main column when their own official debris field shows only dust hit it.
[02:54:38.354 --> 02:54:40.254]  And fires didn't start for hours.
[02:54:40.635 --> 02:54:46.617]  And so they're just all over the map claiming... Then they claim structural failure, but it had been underwritten.
[02:54:46.997 --> 02:54:48.257]  And so that's just bizarre.
[02:54:48.477 --> 02:54:57.661]  Listen, metal desk in the Madrid fire that burned for over a day, little cheap metal nothing desk in the middle of white hot flame didn't melt.
[02:54:58.121 --> 02:55:02.302]  Okay, giant steel, hardened steel does not do that.
[02:55:02.582 --> 02:55:04.003]  It's bottom line physics.
[02:55:04.523 --> 02:55:08.324]  In closing here, during the break, you said you wanted to directly challenge the neocons.
[02:55:08.364 --> 02:55:11.344]  Just specifically, do you want to challenge them to deal with your facts?
[02:55:11.364 --> 02:55:12.385]  Do you want to lay it on the line?
[02:55:13.365 --> 02:55:16.886]  Yes, I ask that they look at the evidence and that they debate.
[02:55:17.944 --> 02:55:21.705]  Myself, yourself, people that support us on those specific issues.
[02:55:22.245 --> 02:55:23.325]  Not about me personally.
[02:55:23.345 --> 02:55:25.166]  Not about what they think of me personally.
[02:55:25.186 --> 02:55:26.746]  They think they know about me personally.
[02:55:27.126 --> 02:55:28.187]  Just about the facts.
[02:55:28.527 --> 02:55:29.467]  I issue that challenge.
[02:55:30.787 --> 02:55:35.948]  In closing, is 9-11 the biggest hoax in world history?
[02:55:38.969 --> 02:55:39.349]  Gosh.
[02:55:40.730 --> 02:55:43.450]  I don't know that I want to make that statement but it's pretty darn close.
[02:55:43.470 --> 02:55:44.491]  Let me just say this, Alex.
[02:55:45.531 --> 02:55:46.211]  It feels like
[02:55:46.730 --> 02:55:50.134]  You and I have started the revolution, and God bless America.
[02:55:51.495 --> 02:55:52.917]  The chair's against the wall.
[02:55:52.977 --> 02:55:54.638]  John has a long mustache.
[02:55:55.099 --> 02:55:57.622]  We're out there, America, fighting behind enemy lines.
[02:55:57.982 --> 02:56:00.965]  Hey, are you guys going to start the Hollywood Wolverine Militia?
[02:56:02.026 --> 02:56:02.587]  Beverly Hills?
[02:56:03.294 --> 02:56:06.316]  I hadn't thought of it until this very moment, but it's a hell of an idea.
[02:56:07.136 --> 02:56:08.457]  That's just one of my attempts at humor.
[02:56:08.697 --> 02:56:15.481]  Listen, it was great having you on, sir, and I appreciate your amazing courage, and we'll be talking to you very, very soon, Charlie Sheen.
[02:56:15.941 --> 02:56:16.562]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:56:16.602 --> 02:56:17.242]  God bless you, man.
[02:56:17.562 --> 02:56:18.303]  Take care, my friend.
[02:56:18.923 --> 02:56:19.904]  An amazing individual.
[02:56:19.924 --> 02:56:20.984]  You ought to know him personally.
[02:56:21.985 --> 02:56:22.305]  All right.
[02:56:22.585 --> 02:56:23.406]  Take care, my friends.
[02:56:25.771 --> 02:56:26.412]  I think we're good to go.
