[00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:06.250]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:08.011]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.671 --> 00:00:09.812]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.432 --> 00:00:11.252]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.013 --> 00:00:12.913]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.573 --> 00:00:17.255]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.755 --> 00:00:21.877]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:35.069 --> 00:00:36.390]  It's amazing!
[00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:38.011]  It's already Thursday, the 28th day of September 2006.
[00:00:38.091 --> 00:00:41.474]  Hard to believe it's been five plus years since 9-11.
[00:00:52.544 --> 00:01:00.692]  All the anticipation of the fifth anniversary and now it's been here and gone and we move forward towards late October.
[00:01:00.712 --> 00:01:14.866]  I have made the prediction that the military-industrial complex will stage terror attacks as a pretext to attack Iran and for a huge domestic draconian crackdown.
[00:01:16.354 --> 00:01:19.636]  They're trying to pass the accompanying secret arrest of U.S.
[00:01:19.696 --> 00:01:23.719]  citizens legislation right now and lying about it as usual.
[00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:37.027]  But my full prediction is that if the people expose government-sponsored terror, if the people speak out, if there's an epiphany, an awakening, a mass enlightenment, a mass revelation,
[00:01:37.891 --> 00:01:48.077]  Of the paradigm of government-sponsored terrorism, we may be able to back these terrorists off and stop this calamity from unfolding and taking place.
[00:01:48.097 --> 00:01:52.840]  And you've been doing a really good job, my friends.
[00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.341]  You've been really spreading the word.
[00:01:55.209 --> 00:02:07.698]  I don't know what's going to happen, but I know we're giving the globalists a run for their money, and so later in the broadcast today, I will go through why I think there's going to be a government-sponsored terror attack, and how I think we can stop it together.
[00:02:08.718 --> 00:02:11.600]  I wasn't going to have guests on today.
[00:02:11.661 --> 00:02:16.464]  I was going to have three hours of news and open phones, but I got an email this morning
[00:02:18.627 --> 00:02:30.216]  And I found out that Laro Jones Chavez was fired from his internet security job at a software design firm in Ohio.
[00:02:31.136 --> 00:02:33.618]  The neocons are getting Steven Jones canned.
[00:02:33.638 --> 00:02:36.160]  They're calling for Kevin Barrett to be fired.
[00:02:36.941 --> 00:02:41.604]  They have gotten Mr. Chavez fired now.
[00:02:42.745 --> 00:02:43.646]  This is what they do.
[00:02:44.066 --> 00:02:45.347]  This is how they operate.
[00:02:46.047 --> 00:02:46.848]  This is their goal.
[00:02:47.941 --> 00:02:55.144]  Calling up, harassing, threatening, yelling at people until the owner, not his manager, we're told, got cold feet.
[00:02:55.624 --> 00:02:58.405]  This is the new blacklist in the United States.
[00:02:59.726 --> 00:03:06.609]  And of course, Mr. Chavez just doesn't have the fact that he boldly told people who he was and where he worked and what he did and got fired over it.
[00:03:07.705 --> 00:03:14.628]  Well, now Mr. Chavez also has people nitpicking at his story, and I haven't seen anything substantive in what they've said.
[00:03:15.288 --> 00:03:28.554]  We have confirmed he was in the military, he was at CENTCOM, and it is bombshell information that he's brought forward that he saw top generals and colonels sitting around talking about how NORAD had been ordered to stand down.
[00:03:29.455 --> 00:03:34.657]  And he also saw information on desk in the days before discussing the drills
[00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:57.872]  So he has now lost his job over all of this, and I'm sure the neocons will chortle it with glee, one step closer to destroying free speech in the United States, one step closer to having full criminal hegemon over our country, and they are going to have a reign of terror.
[00:03:57.932 --> 00:03:59.533]  You think government corruption is bad now?
[00:03:59.973 --> 00:04:01.694]  They're just getting warmed up.
[00:04:04.045 --> 00:04:11.168]  So, Mr. Chavez will be joining us briefly in the second hour to give us an update on his story and what's now happened to him.
[00:04:13.289 --> 00:04:15.470]  Here's the news coming up in the meantime.
[00:04:16.091 --> 00:04:21.553]  Boys told that there could be no standing to go to the bathroom.
[00:04:22.094 --> 00:04:22.954]  They must squat.
[00:04:25.057 --> 00:04:27.998]  That's right, and I've seen reports of this here in the U.S.
[00:04:28.018 --> 00:04:35.002]  They're trying to teach children to do this because it's a way of destroying the separation of the sexes.
[00:04:35.642 --> 00:04:38.784]  It's a way of traumatizing and humiliating and social engineering.
[00:04:40.004 --> 00:04:40.745]  We'll get into that.
[00:04:41.585 --> 00:04:48.988]  Also, it's not just New York calling for banning basically all types of fast food and fried food.
[00:04:50.129 --> 00:04:51.450]  Now it's Chicago.
[00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:54.311]  We've told you about this for years, and now it's happening.
[00:04:55.057 --> 00:04:57.518]  And we'll get into even more serious news.
[00:04:57.718 --> 00:04:58.539]  You'll want to stay with us.
[00:04:59.039 --> 00:05:01.080]  Infowars.com, Infowars.net.
[00:05:04.562 --> 00:05:05.042]  It's here.
[00:05:05.242 --> 00:05:10.024]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:05:10.384 --> 00:05:18.028]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:05:18.735 --> 00:05:25.780]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:37.587]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:05:37.907 --> 00:05:41.430]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:43.811]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:05:44.151 --> 00:05:47.914]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:06:02.096 --> 00:06:05.719]  As snow falls on the majestic Rocky Mountains, it eventually melts.
[00:06:05.899 --> 00:06:11.764]  The water east of the Continental Divide travels downhill over 1,600 miles before reaching the Atlantic Ocean.
[00:06:11.945 --> 00:06:14.287]  On the western side, water travels downhill almost 1,000
[00:06:19.663 --> 00:06:24.006]  How many people and animals has that water passed through before it reaches my area?
[00:06:24.186 --> 00:06:28.150]  Berkey has revolutionized the way water is purified, simply and naturally.
[00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:31.973]  At the heart of these portable systems are the black Berkey purification elements.
[00:06:32.133 --> 00:06:36.937]  So powerful, these elements extract pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, heavy metals,
[00:06:36.937 --> 00:06:37.437]  Thank you.
[00:07:01.519 --> 00:07:04.001]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network.
[00:07:04.121 --> 00:07:06.483]  I have an urgent message for all of our listeners.
[00:07:06.543 --> 00:07:12.728]  The mass media keeps telling us that we are the richest, most powerful economy in the world.
[00:07:14.209 --> 00:07:16.511]  If this is true, why can't we pay our bills?
[00:07:17.171 --> 00:07:20.714]  Why is the United States the world's largest debtor nation?
[00:07:21.255 --> 00:07:25.398]  The truth is that we are in the worst debt bubble in our nation's history.
[00:07:25.979 --> 00:07:28.921]  When the bubble bursts, will you be able to feed your family?
[00:07:29.904 --> 00:07:32.825]  When the inevitable crash occurs, will you be ready?
[00:07:33.565 --> 00:07:39.567]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.
[00:07:39.807 --> 00:07:42.648]  That's 1-888-892-6238.
[00:07:42.888 --> 00:07:46.310]  For the following two free reports.
[00:07:47.190 --> 00:07:47.470]  U.S.
[00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:50.471]  Debt Bubble, Red Alert, and Real Estate Crash.
[00:07:51.431 --> 00:07:53.732]  Call 888-XANADU.
[00:07:53.792 --> 00:07:57.973]  That's 888-XANADU.
[00:07:58.314 --> 00:07:59.274]  And ask for George.
[00:08:01.461 --> 00:08:07.105]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:10.827 --> 00:08:17.191]  Blasting, accelerating towards our 13th year in the fight against the New World Order.
[00:08:18.672 --> 00:08:22.594]  Thank you so much for joining me on this 28th day of September 2006.
[00:08:22.634 --> 00:08:23.495]  It is Thursday.
[00:08:26.135 --> 00:08:35.304]  Coming up at the bottom of the hour, I'm going to air part of a BBC report, BBC hidden camera shows, China selling prisoners' organs.
[00:08:38.387 --> 00:08:42.772]  And it is well known that on holidays, the public spectacle,
[00:08:43.778 --> 00:08:49.182]  is public executions where they blow people's heads off as young as 12 years of age.
[00:08:49.222 --> 00:08:54.565]  Just type in China execution into Google Images and you will see children's heads blown off.
[00:08:54.905 --> 00:09:01.489]  You will see people at sports stadiums lined up being machine gunned for the smallest of offenses.
[00:09:02.350 --> 00:09:04.111]  And you will hear one of the Oregon
[00:09:06.616 --> 00:09:10.018]  And in China, if you criticize the government, if you're caught with an underground church,
[00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:37.814]  If you're caught being a Buddhist, if you're caught doing anything, in Tibet they force all of the Chinese women to marry, excuse me, all of the Tibetan women to marry Chinese men.
[00:09:37.874 --> 00:09:41.175]  There basically are no Tibetans left.
[00:09:41.715 --> 00:09:47.817]  They have only been doing this for about 20 years and already there are no new births of Tibetans.
[00:09:48.716 --> 00:09:50.137]  Open, complete genocide.
[00:09:50.417 --> 00:09:51.818]  And this is what governments do.
[00:09:52.078 --> 00:09:56.641]  Our government's doing the same thing, bringing in all these third world populations to break up the U.S.
[00:09:56.702 --> 00:10:00.624]  and get us all basically to turn against each other and to make sure none of us have cultures.
[00:10:01.084 --> 00:10:02.966]  I don't care if you're Hispanic, white, black.
[00:10:03.866 --> 00:10:05.327]  They're here to destroy our cultures.
[00:10:07.229 --> 00:10:09.150]  China is the world model.
[00:10:09.270 --> 00:10:13.673]  China are the masters and their major
[00:10:14.827 --> 00:10:23.231]  Medical publications and the government publications advertise in English translation, quote, fresh organs.
[00:10:24.772 --> 00:10:28.894]  And they love Falun Gong because they don't drink, they don't smoke, they exercise.
[00:10:29.394 --> 00:10:34.117]  It's really an exercise-slash-Buddhist-Zen-type deal.
[00:10:35.557 --> 00:10:36.378]  They're very healthy.
[00:10:37.108 --> 00:10:38.489]  They love killing them.
[00:10:38.569 --> 00:10:41.712]  Also, they found Christians are quite healthy as well.
[00:10:42.293 --> 00:10:43.494]  But it's Falun Gong.
[00:10:44.035 --> 00:10:45.756]  And they take you and they tissue type you.
[00:10:46.297 --> 00:10:56.026]  And you literally sit there in your cell until a rich Japanese, or rich American, or rich Englander, rich Russian, rich Chinese dies.
[00:10:58.288 --> 00:10:59.129]  Or is going to die.
[00:11:00.832 --> 00:11:08.458]  and needs the organs and they are flown into the province or into Beijing and the prisoner is killed.
[00:11:08.478 --> 00:11:15.104]  In many cases they are even brought to the hospital to be killed where the organ transplantation is going to take place.
[00:11:15.124 --> 00:11:16.084]  This has all been in the news.
[00:11:17.025 --> 00:11:22.450]  And they transplant the organs into the individual that needs them.
[00:11:25.332 --> 00:11:28.935]  So when you go see a science fiction horror movie like The Island
[00:11:29.975 --> 00:11:55.997]  So that was a great movie came out last year where the government you know grows clones and keeps them in an underground base but the government has found out of this private corporation in league with the government has discovered that if you just keep a clone basically in a coma it will die in a few years but they found if you let the clone basically have its own life implant false memories
[00:11:57.261 --> 00:12:00.662]  They're all on exercise regiments.
[00:12:00.703 --> 00:12:03.884]  They're all fed the healthiest food.
[00:12:04.324 --> 00:12:08.946]  They think they work in a factory where there's these big lines that they put different liquids into.
[00:12:09.006 --> 00:12:12.787]  And really that's going into the new clones in their artificial wombs.
[00:12:13.127 --> 00:12:15.408]  So they also work in the factory making more clones.
[00:12:16.348 --> 00:12:22.451]  And a couple of them figure this out kind of innately in a group mind.
[00:12:22.471 --> 00:12:25.852]  It's like a human instinct breaks through and they have an epiphany really.
[00:12:26.542 --> 00:12:27.382]  Which I believe in.
[00:12:28.503 --> 00:12:34.205]  And realize what's kind of a 100 monkey syndrome and break out and have special forces chasing them and killing them.
[00:12:35.866 --> 00:12:37.767]  Hey, you don't need to do that, folks.
[00:12:39.567 --> 00:12:44.950]  I hear neocons lobbying for killing prisoners here for their organs and I have no doubt they will be doing it soon.
[00:12:45.710 --> 00:12:47.951]  But they'll never be able to corner the market
[00:12:48.653 --> 00:12:57.161]  On what China can do, because there have been cases where rich people have rare blood types and folks just get grabbed off the streets in China who are known to have that blood type.
[00:12:58.802 --> 00:13:01.264]  But they don't just go for blood type, they do tissue typing.
[00:13:02.005 --> 00:13:09.712]  I mean, they've got thousands of people in multiple facilities that are admitted with every type of tissue type they need.
[00:13:10.413 --> 00:13:15.717]  And they advertise, hey, we've got special tissue types, not just the blood type, we have a lower rate of rejection.
[00:13:15.797 --> 00:13:16.318]  And they do!
[00:13:16.778 --> 00:13:19.600]  It isn't somebody who died on I-35 in a car accident.
[00:13:20.661 --> 00:13:34.152]  It isn't, you know, they're dead by the time they get to the hospital, they get their organs out, the organs aren't working too good, they throw them on ice, fly them to Minnesota, where it's put in your, you know, father who's dying a liver failure.
[00:13:37.399 --> 00:13:37.999]  No, no, no.
[00:13:38.399 --> 00:13:40.260]  They kill the individual.
[00:13:41.261 --> 00:13:44.682]  They even sanguinate them, if that's the proper term.
[00:13:44.822 --> 00:13:50.104]  Suck out a large portion of blood in case there's a blood transfusion needed right at the time of surgery.
[00:13:52.245 --> 00:13:53.725]  And they also try to line it up.
[00:13:54.245 --> 00:13:57.907]  The reports are that the average is two weeks to get an organ in China.
[00:13:59.007 --> 00:13:59.967]  Of course, here in the U.S.
[00:14:00.007 --> 00:14:03.529]  it's over a year for a kidney and even longer for a liver.
[00:14:03.549 --> 00:14:06.970]  Because you get two kidneys with each death.
[00:14:08.712 --> 00:14:09.352]  Only one liver.
[00:14:11.413 --> 00:14:22.357]  But the only reason, China, it takes two weeks is that they try to line it up where they've got two people of the same blood and tissue type so they don't, quote, waste the fresh organs.
[00:14:23.077 --> 00:14:32.140]  Because if somebody just needs a liver, well then, but we're going to be wasting a heart and two kidneys and lungs and blood and skin.
[00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:34.461]  And they take the skin of these individuals
[00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:42.805]  They take the collagen of the young people they kill, they melt that down and sell it too, and they then sell it to big French and British and U.S.
[00:14:42.845 --> 00:14:51.550]  pharmaco... Big Pharma's gotten into the high-end pharma cosmetics, and the Hollywood types and others get all these skin treatments.
[00:14:51.970 --> 00:15:01.876]  They now, the BBC reported, they have these genetic treatments of dead babies from China, where they're using their bone marrow, baby bone marrow,
[00:15:03.168 --> 00:15:09.350]  Can you imagine being in those factories where they're sawing open the bones and sucking out the marrow out of little babies?
[00:15:10.351 --> 00:15:12.632]  Big piles of them being thrown in buckets.
[00:15:13.332 --> 00:15:13.972]  And you know what?
[00:15:14.012 --> 00:15:15.093]  You don't want to hear about this.
[00:15:15.173 --> 00:15:15.693]  I don't care.
[00:15:15.893 --> 00:15:17.194]  Just change the channel, okay?
[00:15:18.074 --> 00:15:18.574]  Seriously.
[00:15:19.094 --> 00:15:20.895]  I'm not here to win a popularity contest.
[00:15:20.935 --> 00:15:23.556]  I'm here to try to survive and save this society.
[00:15:24.857 --> 00:15:26.017]  I'm on a mission, folks.
[00:15:26.357 --> 00:15:27.998]  I'm dead if we don't turn this around.
[00:15:28.338 --> 00:15:30.679]  And I don't think a lot of you figured out yet, you're dead too.
[00:15:31.434 --> 00:15:42.840]  Do you think you're safe when our government makes deals and loves China and sees them as the world model and sees them as the archetype, sees them as the quintessential blueprint?
[00:15:44.161 --> 00:15:46.162]  You see, our elite has the same attitude.
[00:15:46.762 --> 00:15:51.264]  Your life means absolutely nothing!
[00:15:54.386 --> 00:15:56.187]  It means zero to them.
[00:15:56.227 --> 00:15:57.948]  There are six and a half billion of you
[00:15:59.073 --> 00:16:01.854]  And another hundred million every 16 months, 18 months.
[00:16:03.834 --> 00:16:07.115]  You are actually not just seen as a cheap resource.
[00:16:07.135 --> 00:16:08.615]  You're seen as a parasite.
[00:16:08.635 --> 00:16:10.095]  You're called bugs.
[00:16:10.195 --> 00:16:11.456]  You're called roaches.
[00:16:12.536 --> 00:16:18.917]  Mexican leaders down in Mexico call their own population the roaches and laugh at the US and say the roaches are going to take you over.
[00:16:19.477 --> 00:16:20.558]  That's how they see their people.
[00:16:20.758 --> 00:16:21.978]  That's how the elite sees us.
[00:16:24.025 --> 00:16:29.415]  The cattle, the useless feeders as Ted Turner called us at a press dinner in 1997 on C-SPAN.
[00:16:34.190 --> 00:16:43.398]  And everything they're doing is about bringing in their world government so they can have one-child policies and mass executions and controlled bioweapon releases.
[00:16:43.678 --> 00:16:46.200]  Look at what they already do to us with the water supply and the vaccines.
[00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:47.721]  We're in a nightmare.
[00:16:47.741 --> 00:16:48.562]  Do you understand that?
[00:16:48.842 --> 00:16:50.523]  Yes, you've woken up in a nightmare.
[00:16:50.664 --> 00:16:53.166]  But there's still pretty green trees and the moon comes up at night.
[00:16:53.186 --> 00:16:54.146]  You've still got your girlfriend.
[00:16:54.186 --> 00:16:55.588]  There's still movie theaters.
[00:16:55.808 --> 00:17:00.712]  You see, there's all this basically opium that numbs you while you're in the pen.
[00:17:01.212 --> 00:17:06.277]  And when your neighbor gets grabbed, or their kid gets grabbed, or somebody goes to prison, you kind of ignore it, and, well, that's just them.
[00:17:06.738 --> 00:17:07.779]  Oh, things aren't bad.
[00:17:07.819 --> 00:17:14.466]  You hear reports about, oh, we're going to secretly arrest Americans and put them in secret tribunals, and, oh, they're using the Patriot Act against citizens.
[00:17:14.606 --> 00:17:15.427]  Oh, it's not that bad.
[00:17:15.747 --> 00:17:23.275]  Or, oh, they passed a law for forced psychological testing of everyone four years of age to 18, and now it's going to be pregnant women, too, in Illinois, and forced drugging.
[00:17:24.597 --> 00:17:28.438]  Oh, there's a North American Union, but ah, that's the next phase, merging our countries.
[00:17:28.478 --> 00:17:32.180]  And yeah, most of the major roads will be toll roads with transponders in all your cars.
[00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:33.960]  Oh, well, that's just the way it is.
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.521]  And oh, your cell phone's tracking you, but oh, so what?
[00:17:36.561 --> 00:17:40.222]  And yeah, yeah, they're building more and more prisons, and that's the biggest part of our economy.
[00:17:40.242 --> 00:17:45.984]  But you know, yeah, there's all these reports about election fraud and elections being stolen, but well, you know, that's just how it happens.
[00:17:46.044 --> 00:17:48.765]  And yeah, they're going to have a blanket amnesty, but that's just the way it is.
[00:17:49.125 --> 00:17:54.708]  And yeah, they just had the North American Union government meet a few weeks ago, and they tried to keep it secret, but it's come out in a few newspapers.
[00:17:54.748 --> 00:17:55.569]  But ah, so what?
[00:17:55.909 --> 00:17:58.350]  You know, they're just having whole new governments that are secret.
[00:17:58.650 --> 00:17:59.331]  It's no big deal.
[00:18:00.791 --> 00:18:12.856]  And the police are calling us civilians and wearing weird black uniforms and weird black masks, and they're getting all these armored vehicles in a Houston Chronicle, and the AP are reporting they're building FEMA camps for political dissidents, and eh, but you know.
[00:18:13.136 --> 00:18:16.217]  And the government says they're going to nuke Iran, but oh, they deserve it.
[00:18:16.617 --> 00:18:22.359]  Oh, there's jihadists here who are going to nuke us, and we've just got to have World War III, and oh, the government's not behind the terror.
[00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:23.580]  Oh, everything's fine.
[00:18:27.452 --> 00:18:29.414]  This is the reality of what we face.
[00:18:29.434 --> 00:18:33.617]  And I said I'd get to the organs in the bottom of the hour.
[00:18:35.679 --> 00:18:41.664]  I'm just going to talk about them through this segment, into the next, and at the bottom of the hour we will play this BBC report.
[00:18:42.825 --> 00:18:45.828]  And then I'll get into all of the other news.
[00:18:46.428 --> 00:18:53.234]  But see, what's scary about the organ situation isn't that China's even doing it.
[00:18:53.294 --> 00:18:55.596]  It's horrible, it's a nightmare, but it's what governments do.
[00:18:56.661 --> 00:18:59.323]  They've always cannibalized their own populations in one way or another.
[00:18:59.343 --> 00:19:03.586]  I mean, you know, look at what we've done in this country with abortion.
[00:19:03.786 --> 00:19:04.887]  And we rationalized that.
[00:19:04.907 --> 00:19:06.128]  The Chinese rationalized this.
[00:19:06.208 --> 00:19:07.089]  You know, it's easy.
[00:19:07.329 --> 00:19:08.130]  You just accept it.
[00:19:08.170 --> 00:19:09.511]  You go drink from the poison well.
[00:19:09.871 --> 00:19:11.312]  What did they say the wise king did?
[00:19:11.753 --> 00:19:13.594]  When an evil witch came and poisoned the well?
[00:19:15.756 --> 00:19:16.276]  What did it do?
[00:19:16.536 --> 00:19:17.197]  This is a parable.
[00:19:17.237 --> 00:19:19.458]  Please, New York Times, don't quote me as actually believing this.
[00:19:19.719 --> 00:19:20.199]  It's a parable.
[00:19:20.976 --> 00:19:24.501]  What did the wise king do when the evil witch came at night and poisoned the well in the center of his kingdom?
[00:19:24.661 --> 00:19:25.362]  Poisoned all the water?
[00:19:25.862 --> 00:19:26.703]  Made everybody turn evil?
[00:19:26.944 --> 00:19:28.085]  He went and drank from the well.
[00:19:28.766 --> 00:19:29.687]  And everything was alright.
[00:19:31.590 --> 00:19:32.451]  Because they were going to kill him.
[00:19:33.843 --> 00:19:35.284]  Well, see, that's really an evil parable.
[00:19:35.504 --> 00:19:36.665]  You don't need to go drink from the well.
[00:19:36.905 --> 00:19:46.511]  Just because all these other people snicker and giggle and, ah, let them take organs and let them, let us torture children and let, you know, just because they all say it's okay doesn't make it so.
[00:19:46.812 --> 00:19:47.732]  See, that's what's scary.
[00:19:48.132 --> 00:19:51.495]  Our media and our government, other than British News, they've been pretty fair.
[00:19:52.595 --> 00:20:00.300]  Just, just, oh, China's not doing it, or, oh, let them do it, or, those Falun Gong deserve to die!
[00:20:03.194 --> 00:20:04.235]  The War on Terrorism.
[00:20:04.556 --> 00:20:07.339]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[00:20:07.599 --> 00:20:11.764]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[00:20:12.205 --> 00:20:13.026]  So what do you do?
[00:20:13.346 --> 00:20:17.912]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[00:20:18.396 --> 00:20:20.517]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.

[00:21:03.554 --> 00:21:09.640]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:13.664]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[00:21:14.024 --> 00:21:15.906]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[00:21:15.966 --> 00:21:18.248]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[00:21:18.388 --> 00:21:25.555]  The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as the common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weaker every

[00:22:03.142 --> 00:22:14.725]  Did you know that a semi-secret organization called the Council on Foreign Relations was founded in 1921 by Marxist Colonel Edward Mandel House, who was the personal advisor to President Woodrow Wilson?
[00:22:15.445 --> 00:22:20.787]  Its objective was to capture the foreign policy section of the State Department to help direct U.S.
[00:22:20.847 --> 00:22:24.628]  influence in the overthrow of targeted nations for communism.
[00:22:25.513 --> 00:22:29.818]  They were successful in the overthrow of Cuba and the Union of South Africa and many others.
[00:22:30.499 --> 00:22:34.043]  They control foreign policy in America this very moment in time.
[00:22:34.664 --> 00:22:43.814]  We'd like to help you understand how these things are coming to pass and how they'll affect you by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[00:23:09.668 --> 00:23:18.091]  The best-kept secret in the world today is that now it's possible to kill cancer without personal suffering, mutilation, and poisoning of your entire system.

[00:23:40.929 --> 00:23:42.110]  That's www.LazMedInc.com.
[00:24:11.614 --> 00:24:15.616]  Notice that we once called illegal aliens, illegal aliens.
[00:24:16.997 --> 00:24:20.139]  Then Jimmy Carter in 79 said stop doing that.
[00:24:20.179 --> 00:24:21.640]  The media all followed suit.
[00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:23.441]  Started using different terms.
[00:24:24.161 --> 00:24:25.082]  That's mind control.
[00:24:25.442 --> 00:24:27.443]  That is population manipulation.
[00:24:27.483 --> 00:24:28.324]  That's propaganda.
[00:24:28.744 --> 00:24:30.925]  And then we all started adopting it too.
[00:24:32.186 --> 00:24:34.407]  Then they say don't call them suicide bombers.
[00:24:34.447 --> 00:24:36.368]  Call them homicide bombers.
[00:24:36.428 --> 00:24:37.849]  And people start adopting that.
[00:24:38.402 --> 00:24:40.023]  They're telling you how to speak.
[00:24:40.063 --> 00:24:41.605]  They're manipulating the language.
[00:24:43.226 --> 00:24:44.307]  It's the same thing with China.
[00:24:44.727 --> 00:24:50.392]  They were the communist Chinese until George Bush Sr.
[00:24:50.432 --> 00:24:50.732]  got in.
[00:24:50.773 --> 00:24:52.154]  Remember, he was the first U.S.
[00:24:52.214 --> 00:24:58.819]  ambassador after relations were opened back up by Nixon, right before he became CIA director.
[00:24:59.780 --> 00:25:01.882]  He went in with Kissinger, opened it up.
[00:25:01.922 --> 00:25:02.743]  They made deals.
[00:25:02.783 --> 00:25:05.785]  They said, we will use you to build up the industry.
[00:25:05.845 --> 00:25:06.606]  You buy the dollar.
[00:25:07.711 --> 00:25:24.516]  You peg it to the dollar, we will use it in select deals, your huge factory base with your population will develop your factory base to displace all of the private industries that aren't consolidated under our control in the United States, in Europe and England.
[00:25:25.077 --> 00:25:26.017]  And they've now done that.
[00:25:26.577 --> 00:25:36.080]  They use China as an economic engine with literal slave labor nationwide to use a form of modern mercantilism
[00:25:37.091 --> 00:25:38.252]  To consolidate control.
[00:25:38.272 --> 00:25:40.714]  You're studying mercantilism, it's triangular.
[00:25:41.954 --> 00:25:56.925]  But what they would do was, is they would take sugar from the sugar cane fields, and they would make rum out of that, and then they would go pay the colonies
[00:25:58.397 --> 00:26:25.002]  for other raw materials with the rum and then they would take all the raw materials from the colonies and from the slave colonies both the sugarcane fields and from the New World colonies run by the British and Dutch and German immigrants and they would take those to England and they would then take the raw materials and make value-added items and then sell that back to everybody in the world.
[00:26:26.050 --> 00:26:40.696]  And under the mercantile system, they would not allow the advanced devices, and that would be a sword or a shovel or a musket, to be made in the sugar cane Caribbean colonies or in the North American colonies.
[00:26:41.537 --> 00:26:42.897]  Just go study mercantilism.
[00:26:42.937 --> 00:26:44.118]  It's more complex than that.
[00:26:44.538 --> 00:26:48.940]  But basically, that's what globalism is in the modern day.
[00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:50.341]  You see the film Rollerball?
[00:26:50.801 --> 00:26:53.162]  Not the new one, but the one in the 70s with James Caan.
[00:26:53.803 --> 00:26:59.390]  It's about in the future certain countries, certain cities, are represented by cities.
[00:27:00.191 --> 00:27:00.752]  The U.S.
[00:27:00.812 --> 00:27:03.475]  is represented by Houston and energy.
[00:27:04.136 --> 00:27:11.586]  And then you've got other cities that are involved in, you know, what like Japan is technology or computers.
[00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:22.668]  But see, the globalists then control all those industries and play them off against each other and use that so no one country makes everything.
[00:27:22.748 --> 00:27:27.952]  No one country is a technology or media or energy giant all wrapped into one.
[00:27:28.713 --> 00:27:36.779]  No, one country's raw materials, another country is entertainment, another one is energy, another is transportation.
[00:27:38.220 --> 00:27:42.341]  This is what they do, and this is neo-mercantilism.
[00:27:42.381 --> 00:27:43.382]  It's not free market.
[00:27:45.662 --> 00:27:48.163]  And by the way, I am the person who's developed these ideas.
[00:27:49.124 --> 00:27:50.624]  I'm not reading this out of a book.
[00:27:50.664 --> 00:27:56.906]  I've gone and looked at these terms, looked at these elites, and discovered that that's what they're doing, and that they don't change.
[00:27:56.966 --> 00:27:58.426]  It's the very same people.
[00:27:58.787 --> 00:28:03.148]  Juan Carlos owns the controlling stake of Centra.
[00:28:03.812 --> 00:28:10.138]  Which is the Spanish Coal Road Company that's taking over most of the major roads in Texas, Indiana, California, New York.
[00:28:11.359 --> 00:28:14.602]  And if you look at the deals, the government is just giving it to them.
[00:28:16.384 --> 00:28:18.486]  They're just being given existing roads.
[00:28:20.919 --> 00:28:32.802]  So we're going back to feudalism and mercantilism was a mechanism to attempt to dominate and not allow middle classes or free countries or free societies to develop.
[00:28:32.842 --> 00:28:33.943]  It is a tool of empire.
[00:28:36.103 --> 00:28:39.104]  And that's what the IMF World Bank System is with the central banks.
[00:28:39.124 --> 00:28:40.284]  That's the key to all of it.
[00:28:41.605 --> 00:28:49.707]  They print the money out of nothing and use the military to enforce the fact that that paper is the currency.
[00:28:51.468 --> 00:28:54.332]  They print it out of nothing and then buy the world with it.
[00:28:57.115 --> 00:28:57.936]  It's unbelievable.
[00:28:58.837 --> 00:29:07.008]  And so, when you think, if there's any questions about the mindset and the world view and the aims and the goals of the elite that run this planet.
[00:29:08.465 --> 00:29:09.266]  Just look at China.
[00:29:09.446 --> 00:29:10.847]  They are the Golden Boy.
[00:29:11.168 --> 00:29:13.129]  They are the creme de la creme.
[00:29:13.630 --> 00:29:14.971]  They are the coup de grace.
[00:29:15.051 --> 00:29:16.553]  They are the pinnacle.
[00:29:16.973 --> 00:29:18.014]  They are the model.
[00:29:18.414 --> 00:29:19.916]  They are the prototype.
[00:29:20.636 --> 00:29:22.638]  They are the Adonis.
[00:29:23.279 --> 00:29:24.340]  They are it!
[00:29:25.661 --> 00:29:31.006]  The New World Order, if you read their policy reports on the think tanks, just fall all over themselves.
[00:29:31.647 --> 00:29:39.594]  My gosh, public execution stadiums, internet censorship, secret arrest, one-child policy, killing babies, total state control.
[00:29:41.055 --> 00:29:41.555]  They love it!
[00:29:43.317 --> 00:29:48.781]  And our media keeps it real quiet about how they kill peaceful people for their religious beliefs.
[00:29:51.843 --> 00:29:52.764]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.225 --> 00:29:54.846]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.767 --> 00:29:58.449]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.596 --> 00:30:10.110]  According to a recent report by the National Institute of Health, high blood pressure is a major risk factor for heart disease and the chief risk factor for stroke and heart failure.
[00:30:10.350 --> 00:30:12.153]  It affects about 50 million Americans.
[00:30:12.373 --> 00:30:13.515]  That's one in four adults.
[00:30:13.871 --> 00:30:19.972]  Because many people have high blood pressure for years without knowing it, the American Heart Association calls it the silent killer.
[00:30:20.232 --> 00:30:23.913]  At ResearchedHerbs.com, we recognize your concern for your well-being.

[00:31:01.707 --> 00:31:02.487]  Terrorism!
[00:31:02.627 --> 00:31:03.368]  Terrorism!
[00:31:03.488 --> 00:31:09.549]  Chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallout, biological attack, anthrax, and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic!
[00:31:09.809 --> 00:31:11.410]  Alarming words for our time!
[00:31:11.630 --> 00:31:14.111]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[00:31:14.511 --> 00:31:29.075]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:31:29.095 --> 00:31:29.435]  government.
[00:31:29.595 --> 00:31:31.376]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[00:31:31.776 --> 00:31:37.699]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[00:31:37.819 --> 00:31:42.321]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video Sheltering in Place.

[00:31:49.364 --> 00:31:49.884]  That's 888-803-4438.

[00:32:01.112 --> 00:32:05.154]  People who use Cardivite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[00:32:05.374 --> 00:32:08.756]  For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself time-tested.
[00:32:08.956 --> 00:32:12.378]  Here's Dr. Matson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite.
[00:32:12.685 --> 00:32:15.948]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[00:32:15.968 --> 00:32:21.433]  The basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the disease that we see.
[00:32:21.453 --> 00:32:31.102]  When we do our program, you know, in herbal formulas like cardivite and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill, now going for regular jog a few months later, we know we're doing something right.
[00:32:31.222 --> 00:32:32.583]  It's a well-thought-out formula.
[00:32:32.603 --> 00:32:38.008]  I mean, the idea of it working on yeast and metals both at the same time and liver function is dead on.
[00:32:38.385 --> 00:32:44.390]  If you'll find I think that it'll work more than just on heart problems and circulation problems, it'll work on other problems as well.
[00:32:44.550 --> 00:32:48.934]  For more information call 1-877-928-8822 or visit our website at www.heartdrop.com.

[00:33:08.562 --> 00:33:09.582]  Welcome back, my friends.
[00:33:10.263 --> 00:33:15.064]  I mean, is this an extreme radio broadcast?
[00:33:15.104 --> 00:33:20.606]  We're upset about our country being dissolved officially right now into the North American Union.
[00:33:21.527 --> 00:33:23.147]  And some people have gotten confused out there.
[00:33:23.227 --> 00:33:30.270]  I don't mean the lower 48 and the other, you know, Canada being merged into the U.S.
[00:33:30.310 --> 00:33:32.971]  We're talking about Mexico being merged into it.
[00:33:35.249 --> 00:33:40.793]  Our government is endorsing China, not even criticizing them for killing political dissidents and selling their organs.
[00:33:41.413 --> 00:33:46.316]  Our hospitals allow Americans to come in and get treatment after they've gotten the organs.
[00:33:47.157 --> 00:33:49.358]  I mean, we are giving sucker to this.
[00:33:49.478 --> 00:33:51.800]  We are trucking with this system.
[00:33:51.820 --> 00:33:53.241]  We're going along with it.
[00:33:54.722 --> 00:33:56.623]  Our elite think it's great!
[00:34:00.555 --> 00:34:03.876]  And so, as promised, here is a BBC report.
[00:34:04.076 --> 00:34:04.817]  It's a video report.
[00:34:04.837 --> 00:34:07.458]  It's up on PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[00:34:08.278 --> 00:34:10.379]  But this is an undercover investigation.
[00:34:10.399 --> 00:34:15.401]  BBC News finds that China has a flourishing trade of organs from executed prisoners.
[00:34:15.741 --> 00:34:20.883]  China is becoming the destination of choice for rich foreigners in need of organ transplants.
[00:34:21.384 --> 00:34:25.005]  One hospital said it could provide a liver for about $100,000.
[00:34:25.525 --> 00:34:28.186]  China has more executions than any other country in the world.
[00:34:28.546 --> 00:34:29.547]  Officials told undercover
[00:34:30.769 --> 00:34:34.111]  Reporters that executions increased prior to national holidays.
[00:34:34.491 --> 00:34:36.593]  So many organs are available around those times.
[00:34:36.973 --> 00:34:41.576]  The following video report features hidden camera footage of organs being sold in China.
[00:34:42.877 --> 00:34:46.939]  And they have government and private facilities all over built right next to the prisons.
[00:34:47.379 --> 00:34:54.404]  Imagine humans like like pieces of meat at the supermarket literally tissue type waiting.
[00:34:55.244 --> 00:34:59.487]  Imagine you can stay in there years until the right tissue type, the right blood type,
[00:35:01.067 --> 00:35:01.727]  Cha-ching!
[00:35:02.248 --> 00:35:12.353]  And the rich foreigner, mainly U.S., Canada, England, Germany, Japan's a big part of it, flies in.
[00:35:12.393 --> 00:35:13.233]  Can you imagine?
[00:35:13.273 --> 00:35:15.054]  You're so greedy for your own life.
[00:35:16.375 --> 00:35:20.697]  I mean, it'd be one thing if it was totally vetted and publicly done, but you can't trust government to do that.
[00:35:20.957 --> 00:35:24.159]  And it was only like axe murderers or child molesters.
[00:35:24.719 --> 00:35:26.120]  But see, there's not many of those.
[00:35:27.641 --> 00:35:29.462]  So no, it's Falun Gong.
[00:35:30.174 --> 00:35:32.957]  You got caught praying in a basement.
[00:35:33.777 --> 00:35:35.058]  You got caught meditating.
[00:35:35.279 --> 00:35:37.260]  You got caught praying to Jesus.
[00:35:37.821 --> 00:35:43.265]  We're going to put you in jail for two years and then one day, just like the movie The Island, it's alright, come with us.
[00:35:44.426 --> 00:35:45.247]  And so you don't resist.
[00:35:45.267 --> 00:35:48.890]  They take you out of the cell every day and walk you down to a holding facility and walk you back.
[00:35:48.930 --> 00:35:49.891]  It's what the Russians used to do.
[00:35:49.931 --> 00:35:52.053]  You never knew when you were going to get the bullet in the back of the head.
[00:35:54.258 --> 00:36:00.183]  And they just take the little Christian and the little Buddhist and they just murder them and then they take their organs.
[00:36:00.743 --> 00:36:20.378]  And I can tell you folks, if I was dying of a liver failure, and chances are it would be because I hadn't lived the right lifestyle, or if I was dying of kidney problems, I mean, I'd be wanting to get a liver transplant or something or somebody died in a car wreck, I'd be on the list, but I sure wouldn't be flying over to China so they could murder somebody.
[00:36:20.418 --> 00:36:22.019]  That government's pure evil.
[00:36:23.490 --> 00:36:25.452]  By the way, they threaten to nuke us on a routine basis.
[00:36:25.492 --> 00:36:32.477]  Call press conferences with the Wall Street Journal and New York Times attendants and show, here's 200 cities targeted right now by ICBMs.
[00:36:32.978 --> 00:36:40.424]  When we invade Taiwan, if you make one move or if you get involved in any of our other interests, we will preemptively hit 200 of your cities.
[00:36:40.484 --> 00:36:42.205]  We are ready and wish to have this conflict.
[00:36:42.745 --> 00:36:44.527]  I am the head of the Chinese military.
[00:36:45.911 --> 00:36:47.672]  Meanwhile, Iran licking boots.
[00:36:47.712 --> 00:36:48.593]  We want to be friendly.
[00:36:48.633 --> 00:36:49.574]  We want to be nice.
[00:36:50.054 --> 00:36:53.257]  Oh, Syria, we'll torture whoever you ship here for you.
[00:36:53.297 --> 00:36:54.177]  We'll follow orders.
[00:36:54.778 --> 00:37:03.885]  And then just all lies and propaganda and how they need to be attacked and lots of stupid neocon phony conservatives strutting around talking about how they're patriotic.
[00:37:03.925 --> 00:37:04.766]  You make me want to puke.
[00:37:06.787 --> 00:37:09.329]  Let's go ahead and roll this BBC piece.
[00:37:09.369 --> 00:37:11.090]  This is what we have in our future.
[00:37:11.391 --> 00:37:14.993]  Guaranteed, when you accept this type of evil and you embrace it, it comes here.
[00:37:15.414 --> 00:37:15.674]  Roll it.
[00:37:16.787 --> 00:37:21.089]  This hospital is one of the biggest organ transplant centers in northern China.
[00:37:26.731 --> 00:37:34.114]  Using a hidden camera, I'm going undercover to try and find out whether the organs being used here come from executed prisoners.
[00:37:37.536 --> 00:37:40.797]  I've told the hospital I'm looking for a new liver for my ailing father.
[00:37:44.212 --> 00:37:47.074]  The chief surgeon, Dr. Deng, tells me he can get a matching liver in less than three weeks.
[00:37:47.134 --> 00:37:49.515]  Then I broach the awkward issue of where the liver will come from.
[00:38:16.689 --> 00:38:17.470]  Another man arrives.
[00:38:18.010 --> 00:38:20.853]  This is the hospital's agent for dealing with foreign clients.
[00:38:21.934 --> 00:38:28.981]  He's eager to do business and produces documents for making a payment of £50,000 to a bank account in Hong Kong.
[00:38:30.082 --> 00:38:31.804]  He's also far less discreet.
[00:38:35.103 --> 00:38:44.532]  Then an astonishing admission that an increase in executions ahead of the October 1st national holiday means there's a sudden abundance of organs.
[00:39:00.143 --> 00:39:02.444]  Does this have anything to do with it?
[00:39:02.544 --> 00:39:03.484]  Of course it does.
[00:39:03.504 --> 00:39:16.427]  For example, in order to stabilize society, in order to do that, before the show, or before the showdown, or before the main event, there are a lot of people who don't have a chance to participate in the show.
[00:39:16.467 --> 00:39:21.088]  The audience has to decide for themselves, and if it's okay with them, they come early.
[00:39:22.887 --> 00:39:29.513]  This hospital has just been doubled in size to keep up with the demand from wealthy foreigners for new organs.
[00:39:30.074 --> 00:39:34.077]  China is now a world centre of the organ transplant industry.
[00:39:34.638 --> 00:39:38.061]  But it's an industry that is based on one rather horrifying statistic.
[00:39:38.521 --> 00:39:43.065]  That China executes more people every year than the rest of the world put together.
[00:39:45.808 --> 00:39:49.470]  The hospital says the prisoners all donate their organs voluntarily.
[00:39:51.291 --> 00:39:55.733]  But this is how prisoners in China go to their deaths.
[00:39:55.773 --> 00:39:58.795]  This is a public execution rally from July this year.
[00:39:58.815 --> 00:40:03.077]  This man's name is Yu Jianfang.
[00:40:03.477 --> 00:40:07.259]  The noose around his neck is to choke him if he tries to call out.
[00:40:07.279 --> 00:40:13.142]  Is this man really in a position to make a free choice about donating his organs?
[00:40:17.124 --> 00:40:21.145]  In a poor village in northern China, we tracked down Yu Jianfang's father.
[00:40:22.546 --> 00:40:26.848]  I asked him whether his son ever talked to him about donating his organs after his death.
[00:40:44.095 --> 00:40:45.957]  Mr. Yu's experience is typical.
[00:40:46.617 --> 00:40:49.020]  After death, the bodies are quickly cremated.
[00:40:49.461 --> 00:40:52.564]  All evidence of organ removal is consumed in the flames.
[00:40:54.646 --> 00:40:57.710]  Back at the hospital, the cafeteria is buzzing with foreigners.
[00:40:58.795 --> 00:41:05.417]  Last year, this hospital performed 600 liver transplants, each costing £50,000 or more.
[00:41:06.518 --> 00:41:10.699]  Organs are now big business in China, but it's one built on death and deception.
[00:41:11.700 --> 00:41:14.540]  Rupert Winfield Hayes, BBC News in Tianjin, China.
[00:41:15.521 --> 00:41:18.382]  I want to get Rupert Winfield Hayes on.
[00:41:18.402 --> 00:41:21.583]  That guy is an incredible patriot for humanity.
[00:41:24.404 --> 00:41:28.787]  And if you've got the nerve, folks, just go type in Chinese public execution.
[00:41:29.328 --> 00:41:34.731]  You will see them blowing small children, I mean, they look like they're about 10 or 12, heads off.
[00:41:35.412 --> 00:41:37.053]  I mean, splattered children's heads.
[00:41:37.753 --> 00:41:43.237]  I mean, Chinese troops with pleasure blowing their heads off.
[00:41:44.478 --> 00:41:46.339]  And you see, they don't hide it.
[00:41:46.579 --> 00:41:47.320]  They don't need to.
[00:41:48.220 --> 00:41:53.264]  It is in official Chinese government newspapers, magazines, medical publications,
[00:41:54.514 --> 00:42:07.076]  And the State Department, when it attacked myself, Jeff Rents, and others with disinformation last year, said part of our disinformation is that China sells political dissidents organs, or that they sell prisoners organs, period.
[00:42:07.096 --> 00:42:14.697]  Of course, a three-year-old area of the State Department talked about the organs and said how horrible it was, but see, things have changed in just three years.
[00:42:14.717 --> 00:42:16.358]  I guess now that'd be four years.
[00:42:17.778 --> 00:42:19.978]  You see, now it's just everything's lying.
[00:42:22.019 --> 00:42:23.299]  The Urban Legends website,
[00:42:24.182 --> 00:42:30.125]  Says that illegal aliens or foreigners of this country aren't given 10 years of tax free.
[00:42:30.665 --> 00:42:32.686]  It's admitted, it's public, they just say it isn't true.
[00:42:33.426 --> 00:42:41.589]  The urban legend site, last time I checked, that everyone acts like is God, which itself is an urban legend, a hoax, says China doesn't sell organs.
[00:42:42.110 --> 00:42:42.730]  Political dissidents.
[00:42:44.511 --> 00:42:51.395]  Doesn't matter if they got public executions with arenas with 100,000 people, sharing people being machine gunned with big ropes around their neck.
[00:42:51.635 --> 00:42:54.197]  The minute they start to argue or scream out, they're just hung.
[00:42:56.178 --> 00:43:01.381]  People with gags on their mouths, and the BBC halfway acts like they have to investigate that.
[00:43:01.881 --> 00:43:04.583]  Oh, the Chinese say they signed themselves over.
[00:43:09.266 --> 00:43:13.048]  They take Falun Gong for nothing more than being secret members of the sect.
[00:43:14.733 --> 00:43:17.416]  And they beat them and torture them for weeks on end.
[00:43:17.436 --> 00:43:21.160]  In many cases they die under the torture to find out who else is Falun Gong.
[00:43:22.361 --> 00:43:23.982]  Which doesn't really seem like a religion.
[00:43:24.423 --> 00:43:28.707]  I call it Buddhist, but when people have studied it say it's like an exercise meditation.
[00:43:28.727 --> 00:43:30.209]  They don't even really follow Buddha.
[00:43:30.309 --> 00:43:31.790]  You can't even really call it a religion.
[00:43:33.212 --> 00:43:34.373]  And of course Christians too.
[00:43:35.462 --> 00:43:45.306]  Not as many though, because Christians go absolutely ape, and there is a little bit of a Christian media in Europe and in the US and in Ireland that will gripe about it a little bit, and in Hong Kong.
[00:43:47.747 --> 00:43:49.027]  But they are killing Christians.
[00:43:50.127 --> 00:43:53.149]  And if you get accused of shoplifting, execution.
[00:43:53.249 --> 00:43:54.869]  You get accused of anything they want.
[00:43:55.129 --> 00:44:02.212]  They want your wife, they want your business, you won't give up your house that you've had for 50 years, they come and bulldoze it to give it to some rich general.
[00:44:04.224 --> 00:44:07.805]  Now the good news is there's a fight going on in China.
[00:44:08.145 --> 00:44:10.366]  There's a fight in America, but it's nothing like it should be.
[00:44:10.386 --> 00:44:13.407]  But over in China, they're not as chicken-necked as we are.
[00:44:13.927 --> 00:44:15.507]  They're more like we were in the past.
[00:44:17.888 --> 00:44:29.071]  You can pull up all the ITN and BBC videos, never in our media, of farmers running at police with clubs and sticks and hatchets
[00:44:30.755 --> 00:44:36.137]  And the police are in black riot gear, firing machine guns at them, mowing them down.
[00:44:38.778 --> 00:44:44.840]  And then of course, in almost every case we've seen, the police lose.
[00:44:46.300 --> 00:44:47.501]  Then they call in troops.
[00:44:48.314 --> 00:44:51.657]  And the troops can just cordon off an area of a city and let people start starving.
[00:44:51.937 --> 00:44:54.139]  Did you know that's happening every couple weeks?
[00:44:54.219 --> 00:44:55.040]  I see reports of it.
[00:44:55.260 --> 00:44:57.262]  There are whole sectors shut off in China.
[00:44:57.682 --> 00:45:00.725]  It was the peasants who got conned by the CIA and Mao Zedong.
[00:45:00.945 --> 00:45:02.827]  Now admitted the CIA was behind Mao, by the way.
[00:45:03.687 --> 00:45:04.588]  Totally declassified now.
[00:45:05.709 --> 00:45:06.430]  Even on History Channel.
[00:45:07.390 --> 00:45:13.756]  They got conned and thought he was a revolutionary and then so for twenty-something years they acted like
[00:45:15.072 --> 00:45:18.657]  You know, China went from 1949 to 1970 before they opened relations.
[00:45:19.058 --> 00:45:23.204]  They acted like China was this big evil thing, America in a big fight.
[00:45:23.524 --> 00:45:24.526]  It was always staged.
[00:45:25.527 --> 00:45:28.492]  But now those same hard peasants, and they're hard-working people.
[00:45:29.611 --> 00:45:44.587]  Now it's figured out that it's a big scam, and folks, they are charging police with machine guns, and they mow down the first few lines, and with hatchets and clubs, they beat that blood-sucking, vampiric filth to death.
[00:45:46.429 --> 00:45:47.310]  With clubs!
[00:45:49.232 --> 00:45:51.555]  And you watch, they're going to end up taking that country back.
[00:45:54.022 --> 00:45:55.403]  China's trying to do what the U.S.
[00:45:55.443 --> 00:45:55.803]  does now.
[00:45:55.823 --> 00:46:02.529]  They're trying to kill their people with the opiate of entertainment, and in movies, and in cheap possessions, baubles.
[00:46:02.989 --> 00:46:04.170]  But it isn't working, folks.
[00:46:06.031 --> 00:46:08.353]  People are tired of having their second baby killed.
[00:46:09.114 --> 00:46:11.696]  They used to beat their brains out right in front of them and drown them in a bucket.
[00:46:11.716 --> 00:46:18.501]  Now they're so valuable, they're taking the living babies off for medical experiments, and they're finding them later in tanks, selling their organs here domestically.
[00:46:18.601 --> 00:46:19.562]  Oh, you haven't seen those reports?
[00:46:19.882 --> 00:46:21.083]  Yeah, they take the babies.
[00:46:21.832 --> 00:46:23.333]  And then use them for medical experiments.
[00:46:23.473 --> 00:46:24.394]  God help us!
[00:46:24.434 --> 00:46:25.254]  We're demons!
[00:46:25.714 --> 00:46:26.435]  My God!
[00:46:26.475 --> 00:46:29.277]  How does God even let us continue to live?
[00:46:30.417 --> 00:46:31.798]  We are just scum!
[00:46:37.222 --> 00:46:39.003]  And our government loves China!
[00:46:39.043 --> 00:46:40.043]  That's what's so scary!
[00:46:40.324 --> 00:46:41.444]  They're the model!
[00:46:41.464 --> 00:46:47.348]  And it's all coming here!
[00:46:50.143 --> 00:46:51.583]  And I know there's police out there listening.
[00:46:51.603 --> 00:46:52.444]  They're so brainwashed.
[00:46:52.464 --> 00:46:59.686]  They heard me talk about how it was good that farmers who were having all their ancestral little plots taken, beating police and military to death.
[00:46:59.966 --> 00:47:04.327]  I know that there's police so brainwashed out there, they just buffed up and went, what, fellow cops?
[00:47:04.607 --> 00:47:08.008]  So you see yourself as part of government, no matter where it is, no matter what it does.
[00:47:10.183 --> 00:47:11.884]  You see yourself as part of the system.
[00:47:11.904 --> 00:47:13.365]  You'll do whatever you're told.
[00:47:13.545 --> 00:47:14.826]  And that's why the country's gone.
[00:47:15.046 --> 00:47:17.048]  You didn't identify with those farmers just now.
[00:47:17.308 --> 00:47:18.729]  You psychologically identified.
[00:47:18.749 --> 00:47:19.490]  Are you ashamed?
[00:47:19.730 --> 00:47:21.211]  Are you getting chills up your back right now?
[00:47:21.231 --> 00:47:22.512]  Do you have any soul left?
[00:47:22.752 --> 00:47:23.652]  Any conscience left?
[00:47:23.672 --> 00:47:26.334]  Or have you totally been taken over and given over to evil?
[00:47:27.755 --> 00:47:30.877]  I know a lot of you have been into this so long you've just been given over to it.
[00:47:32.659 --> 00:47:35.841]  Your logic is so warped and so twisted
[00:47:39.508 --> 00:47:51.394]  That I'm a hothead because I'm upset about the fact that they are selling the organs of tens of thousands of murdered people, most of them political dissidents in China.
[00:47:54.135 --> 00:47:59.578]  And that fat, dumb, and happy Americans are going over there and being some of the biggest buyers.
[00:48:02.304 --> 00:48:07.487]  I remember that woman in another BBC report who was getting the baby marrow injected into her from China.
[00:48:08.028 --> 00:48:11.029]  And she was going, I'm 55 and I already feel more beautiful.
[00:48:11.069 --> 00:48:12.430]  And showed her a picture, she was good looking.
[00:48:13.111 --> 00:48:14.171]  Oh, I'm getting so young.
[00:48:14.251 --> 00:48:15.492]  I don't care where it comes from.
[00:48:15.532 --> 00:48:16.573]  And had her giggling.
[00:48:16.593 --> 00:48:18.134]  I ought to dig that report out.
[00:48:19.795 --> 00:48:21.436]  I mean, what on earth?
[00:48:22.436 --> 00:48:23.597]  Women, what's wrong with you?
[00:48:23.617 --> 00:48:24.718]  You're supposed to get wrinkles.
[00:48:24.738 --> 00:48:25.558]  You're supposed to get old.
[00:48:25.578 --> 00:48:26.839]  You're supposed to have grandchildren.
[00:48:26.859 --> 00:48:28.000]  They're supposed to love you.
[00:48:29.728 --> 00:48:31.229]  So what if you got wrinkles?
[00:48:31.609 --> 00:48:36.533]  My gosh, you would not have wrinkles at the expense of dead babies?
[00:48:37.273 --> 00:48:38.674]  What is wrong with you?
[00:48:39.055 --> 00:48:40.476]  Wrinkles are part of life!
[00:48:45.399 --> 00:48:47.601]  What is your major malfunction?
[00:48:48.783 --> 00:48:51.504]  By the way, you know, they're saying they can cause a bunch of weird health problems.
[00:48:51.744 --> 00:48:52.984]  It's going to end up cursing these women.
[00:48:53.004 --> 00:48:57.245]  They're going to get weird blood diseases and weird, you know, things from all this.
[00:48:57.525 --> 00:48:58.486]  Studies are already coming out.
[00:48:58.526 --> 00:48:59.106]  They don't care.
[00:48:59.286 --> 00:49:00.546]  So they're cursing themselves, too.
[00:49:00.806 --> 00:49:06.288]  I mean, even if they don't believe in God after death and don't believe in heaven and hell, you're going to be cursed, most of you, while you're here.
[00:49:06.308 --> 00:49:10.369]  I mean, you reap what you sow.
[00:49:10.449 --> 00:49:11.209]  You get it twice.
[00:49:11.249 --> 00:49:12.669]  You get it here and when you die.
[00:49:12.849 --> 00:49:14.690]  But if you don't believe you get it after you die, fine.
[00:49:14.850 --> 00:49:15.730]  You're going to get it here.
[00:49:16.849 --> 00:49:19.732]  Let me tell you something, you trash sucking yuppies, all of you.
[00:49:20.293 --> 00:49:21.734]  All over Europe, all over the U.S.
[00:49:22.115 --> 00:49:35.670]  Let me tell you something, you're going to lose your pension funds, you're going to lose your bank accounts, and most of you will suck boots and you'll go join the system and you're still going to be living in squalor, you'll get some little uniform to go around in your neighborhood, you'll be the little boss, but there'll be some boss over you.
[00:49:36.573 --> 00:49:38.775]  A lot of you won't get to be little bosses in this system.
[00:49:39.135 --> 00:49:45.301]  A lot of you that are gonna laugh when you got me in some room someday breaking my jaw and knocking my teeth out and clubbing my head in.
[00:49:45.581 --> 00:49:47.663]  It'll be you in two years they're doing it too.
[00:49:47.883 --> 00:49:49.144]  You scum!
[00:49:49.804 --> 00:49:50.765]  You filth!
[00:49:50.825 --> 00:49:51.786]  You maggot!
[00:49:52.647 --> 00:49:53.668]  Pieces of trash!
[00:49:56.053 --> 00:50:01.674]  I tell you what, I'm so sick of looking at decadent, slack-jawed, bug-eyed Americans.
[00:50:01.854 --> 00:50:03.334]  You people are a shame.
[00:50:03.835 --> 00:50:08.796]  Our founding fathers, I guarantee you, looked down on you from heaven and just want to puke all over you.
[00:50:09.016 --> 00:50:10.396]  You're the trash of the earth.
[00:50:10.716 --> 00:50:13.056]  You are shameful scum!
[00:50:13.437 --> 00:50:14.617]  You make me sick!
[00:50:15.497 --> 00:50:16.597]  Oh, you make me sick!
[00:50:17.777 --> 00:50:20.178]  Because you're not normal.
[00:50:20.238 --> 00:50:21.938]  You don't have your head screwed on right.
[00:50:22.458 --> 00:50:25.519]  Normal people get freaked out about ghoul
[00:50:26.713 --> 00:50:30.894]  Facilities full of people waiting for, to have their organs taken!
[00:50:31.874 --> 00:50:35.655]  Normal people get upset about them taking babies for medical experiments!
[00:50:36.175 --> 00:50:42.276]  Normal people get freaked out by White House memos saying they can do sexual torture to children!
[00:50:43.276 --> 00:50:45.337]  Normal people get freaked out!
[00:50:45.857 --> 00:50:47.897]  Normal people get pissed off!
[00:50:48.418 --> 00:50:50.698]  Normal people get violent!
[00:50:51.018 --> 00:50:52.358]  You're scum!
[00:50:52.378 --> 00:50:54.419]  Ugh, I hate you!
[00:50:54.499 --> 00:50:55.159]  We'll be right back.
[00:51:04.711 --> 00:51:07.894]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[00:51:08.234 --> 00:51:10.176]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[00:51:10.556 --> 00:51:18.222]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:18.882 --> 00:51:25.928]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:51:26.348 --> 00:51:29.271]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran.
[00:51:29.671 --> 00:51:31.993]  A White House program to disseminate fake news.
[00:51:32.413 --> 00:51:33.194]  NSA spying.
[00:51:33.706 --> 00:51:37.769]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:51:38.070 --> 00:51:41.552]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:51:42.033 --> 00:51:43.934]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:51:44.295 --> 00:51:48.198]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:53:57.238 --> 00:53:59.860]  Celebrating 18 years of dedication.
[00:54:04.126 --> 00:54:10.429]  Okay, I meant to spend about 10 minutes on China and Oregon, and I've spent really about 50 of the last 54 minutes on it.
[00:54:13.651 --> 00:54:17.693]  And it just, today's news just sent me off a cliff here.
[00:54:18.334 --> 00:54:29.840]  There is a news blitz telling everyone that the new legislation that Bush has introduced does not, the Military Commissions Act, and that's just one of the two bills,
[00:54:30.589 --> 00:54:31.609]  does not affect U.S.
[00:54:31.649 --> 00:54:32.090]  citizens.
[00:54:32.110 --> 00:54:36.591]  That is a total lie and I have a mainstream news article stating it affects U.S.
[00:54:36.631 --> 00:54:37.831]  citizens, but forget that.
[00:54:37.851 --> 00:54:43.233]  I actually went and read part of the eighty, what is it, eighty-seven page bill.
[00:54:44.994 --> 00:54:49.395]  I did it with keyword searches in it and the only, there's a bunch of tricks they play.
[00:54:49.455 --> 00:54:50.215]  It's the same thing.
[00:54:50.675 --> 00:54:53.056]  This is not amnesty, it's guest worker program.
[00:54:54.157 --> 00:54:57.138]  This is not North American Union, it's a North American community.
[00:54:57.698 --> 00:54:58.318]  It's just more
[00:54:59.062 --> 00:55:00.263]  Yes, it affects U.S.
[00:55:00.303 --> 00:55:02.524]  citizens, and yes, they're a bunch of liars.
[00:55:04.825 --> 00:55:07.306]  But how do you deal with it when they just lie and lie?
[00:55:07.366 --> 00:55:09.327]  It's like when they said the Patriot Act didn't affect U.S.
[00:55:09.367 --> 00:55:09.727]  citizens.
[00:55:10.087 --> 00:55:15.130]  Just type into Google, local government or states using Patriot Act, and they're using it against everybody.
[00:55:17.031 --> 00:55:21.233]  You heard Dr. Roberts yesterday talk about this, so I'm going to later in the next hour, I'll get into this.
[00:55:23.094 --> 00:55:23.514]  Also,
[00:55:25.081 --> 00:55:27.241]  I've seen reports of this all over the western world.
[00:55:27.702 --> 00:55:30.082]  Boys told no standing to urinate.
[00:55:30.882 --> 00:55:32.842]  It's a human right not to have to sit down.
[00:55:33.443 --> 00:55:35.523]  Like a girl, says a member of their government.
[00:55:35.923 --> 00:55:37.103]  This is in Norway.
[00:55:38.103 --> 00:55:39.904]  First they make everybody use the same bathroom.
[00:55:39.924 --> 00:55:42.064]  That's the first thing they do to destroy the sexes.
[00:55:42.884 --> 00:55:45.005]  Humiliate everybody.
[00:55:45.285 --> 00:55:50.266]  They started that in Norway and now they say the boys have to sit down.
[00:55:51.446 --> 00:55:52.386]  You can't be different.
[00:55:53.263 --> 00:55:54.704]  And she never thought that would happen.
[00:55:54.764 --> 00:55:55.264]  It's happening.
[00:55:56.365 --> 00:56:02.409]  Chicago, it's not just New York, Chicago is proposing banning, quote, trans fats.
[00:56:02.509 --> 00:56:04.210]  And folks, I know trans fats aren't good.
[00:56:05.831 --> 00:56:07.832]  But the road to hell is paved with good intentions.
[00:56:08.012 --> 00:56:09.433]  And they're not going to stop there.
[00:56:09.453 --> 00:56:15.517]  It's like they started taking people's children who were, say, you know, 70 pounds higher than they should be.
[00:56:16.440 --> 00:56:17.700]  People say, well, that's reasonable.
[00:56:17.800 --> 00:56:23.742]  And now in Arkansas, they do a yearly review, and if your child's just 15-20 pounds overweight, CPS is snatching them.
[00:56:25.202 --> 00:56:27.803]  You see, it's all controlled.
[00:56:27.823 --> 00:56:29.403]  The government isn't supposed to be in your life.
[00:56:29.443 --> 00:56:35.325]  If you're so stupid, you eat trans fats, and you let your kids eat it, when it's totally poisonous and bad for you, it's your fault!
[00:56:37.205 --> 00:56:44.287]  You know, my liberty is so important that I let people let their kids be obese, and let them have all that, and let them all die of diabetes.
[00:56:45.060 --> 00:56:47.101]  Because the government is not going to help me.
[00:56:47.161 --> 00:56:48.761]  It's not going to come in and save me anyways.
[00:56:49.001 --> 00:56:51.202]  They're not coming to do all this because they care about us.
[00:56:51.422 --> 00:56:53.862]  They're coming to do this because they want to tax it and regulate it.
[00:56:53.882 --> 00:56:55.563]  I have the federal documents here in front of me.
[00:56:55.823 --> 00:57:02.344]  They plan through your national ID card that you're going to swipe along with your sales tax appropriation apportionment.
[00:57:03.224 --> 00:57:05.645]  They're also going to swipe it and they're going to keep a catalog.
[00:57:05.665 --> 00:57:09.566]  This is official Commerce Department and Agriculture Department documents going back seven years.
[00:57:09.586 --> 00:57:10.486]  I pulled them this morning.
[00:57:11.906 --> 00:57:13.987]  I'm trying to get Paul to write an article about it.
[00:57:15.006 --> 00:57:16.428]  Paul or Steve, or maybe Slick Eisen.
[00:57:17.829 --> 00:57:20.672]  And it says in there that they're just going to tax you.
[00:57:20.732 --> 00:57:24.315]  It'll know how much ice cream you got, how many eggs you got, how much milk you got.
[00:57:24.335 --> 00:57:26.417]  It'll say what's bad, how much steak you got.
[00:57:27.519 --> 00:57:31.242]  And then it's going to add a tax once you go above a certain level.
[00:57:31.262 --> 00:57:37.889]  And it says they'll know how much beer you buy, and you will get a health department visit to see if you're a drunk.
[00:57:38.962 --> 00:57:44.505]  Remember the case two years ago where the guy went to the doctor with heart palpitations at 55 and he said, well, do you drink?
[00:57:44.565 --> 00:57:45.225]  And he said, yeah.
[00:57:45.565 --> 00:57:47.166]  I drink a six-pack every night on average.
[00:57:47.526 --> 00:57:48.367]  He said, do you drink and drive?
[00:57:48.407 --> 00:57:48.947]  He said, no.
[00:57:49.247 --> 00:57:53.790]  The doctor was on record saying, well, he didn't drink and drive, but I just thought he shouldn't have a license because he drank.
[00:57:53.810 --> 00:57:54.890]  And they took his license.
[00:57:55.731 --> 00:57:56.591]  No judge, no jury.
[00:57:57.852 --> 00:57:58.792]  See, that's the new world.
[00:57:59.172 --> 00:58:01.013]  That's why they want this tracking grid.
[00:58:01.533 --> 00:58:04.075]  Everything you do will be tracked and put in a database.
[00:58:05.335 --> 00:58:06.216]  Oh, it's going to be bad.
[00:58:07.120 --> 00:58:09.801]  And New York is moving to ban trans fats.
[00:58:09.901 --> 00:58:10.302]  Period.
[00:58:11.162 --> 00:58:14.044]  And that's a whole new class of trans fats police.
[00:58:14.544 --> 00:58:16.985]  Investigating what's in your fridgie.
[00:58:17.445 --> 00:58:19.006]  Oh, it's not going to stop with McDonald's.
[00:58:20.667 --> 00:58:22.988]  They'll expand the definition of what's bad for you.
[00:58:24.149 --> 00:58:25.389]  So I'm going to get into all that too.
[00:58:26.510 --> 00:58:27.550]  But I know, we're bad.
[00:58:27.630 --> 00:58:30.632]  We need food police and we need to tell the boys to squat.
[00:58:31.152 --> 00:58:33.093]  And we need to do this.
[00:58:33.133 --> 00:58:34.794]  Because you know, we're under mass mind control.
[00:58:35.504 --> 00:58:38.986]  I tell you, the government are the cult leaders and we're a cult of just Froot Loops!
[00:58:41.287 --> 00:58:46.150]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNLive.com or call toll free 877-300-7645.
[00:58:46.190 --> 00:58:46.630]  Big Brother.
[00:58:46.790 --> 00:58:47.570]  Mainstream media.
[00:58:47.791 --> 00:58:51.793]  Government cover-ups.
[00:58:51.813 --> 00:58:56.555]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.381 --> 00:59:05.282]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.302 --> 00:59:09.626]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.126 --> 00:59:14.249]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:15.651 --> 00:59:23.197]  Well, four days ago we had Laro Jones Gonzalez, or LJ as he was known in the military.
[00:59:23.757 --> 00:59:24.858]  Sergeant on with us.
[00:59:25.659 --> 00:59:26.600]  Got out of the military.
[00:59:28.507 --> 00:59:33.849]  In late 2002, we got his DD-214 Honorable Discharge.
[00:59:34.110 --> 00:59:37.311]  Last post was at Central Command in Tampa, Florida.
[00:59:37.371 --> 00:59:38.251]  All that was confirmed.
[00:59:38.272 --> 00:59:39.072]  We've made phone calls.
[00:59:39.112 --> 00:59:39.612]  Confirmed it.
[00:59:39.632 --> 00:59:44.194]  A lot of people ran around screaming, saying his story just couldn't be true.
[00:59:44.234 --> 00:59:46.955]  They didn't really point out anything real to criticize him.
[00:59:46.995 --> 00:59:48.436]  But to say a lot of it, you've got to vet stuff.
[00:59:49.056 --> 00:59:51.438]  You don't want to over-vet it to where you start getting delusional.
[00:59:52.638 --> 00:59:55.860]  And, you know, when he wrote a letter to the Cincinnati Post, he lives up in Ohio now.
[00:59:57.674 --> 01:00:00.116]  The security for an IT software developer.
[01:00:03.138 --> 01:00:06.441]  That's what he did was help work on the computers and stuff when he was at CENTCOM.
[01:00:06.501 --> 01:00:07.722]  That's why I was able to see all this stuff.
[01:00:09.103 --> 01:00:14.607]  He put his name and where he worked and what he did out in the open in the letter.
[01:00:15.108 --> 01:00:18.591]  And that took a few months for the letter to get around the web and get real big and for us to interview him.
[01:00:18.631 --> 01:00:20.792]  And he got fired yesterday, last night.
[01:00:22.313 --> 01:00:24.135]  He'll be joining us coming up in the next segment.
[01:00:26.411 --> 01:00:27.452]  He got fired!
[01:00:27.972 --> 01:00:30.793]  The neocons called up by the hundreds demanding he be fired.
[01:00:30.833 --> 01:00:32.514]  How dare you have a traitor working for you?
[01:00:32.554 --> 01:00:34.615]  How dare you have this evil creature?
[01:00:35.996 --> 01:00:38.537]  He doesn't just have those guys wanting his blood.
[01:00:39.698 --> 01:00:45.981]  Some of the 9-11 truthers, some of them ask real questions, but after a while the questions just got ridiculous.
[01:00:46.261 --> 01:00:53.065]  And nitpicking, and twisting, and backflipping, and none of them ever really tried to go vet anything or make calls.
[01:00:54.042 --> 01:00:57.246]  But I mean, I'd say 95% chance that Lara is for real.
[01:00:57.567 --> 01:00:58.488]  His story checks out.
[01:00:58.508 --> 01:00:59.509]  He did work at CENTCOM.
[01:01:00.270 --> 01:01:02.993]  And the big news is he saw a general being talked to by some of the colonels.
[01:01:03.254 --> 01:01:06.057]  And they're saying, why haven't they shot down any of these planes?
[01:01:06.077 --> 01:01:06.638]  What's happening?
[01:01:07.139 --> 01:01:11.905]  And they said, well, it's some kind of stand down to NORAD.
[01:01:11.925 --> 01:01:12.906]  They were told to stand down.
[01:01:14.016 --> 01:01:16.037]  Everybody knows CENTCOM interfaces with NORTHCOM.
[01:01:16.057 --> 01:01:17.918]  Everybody knows it was part of those drills.
[01:01:17.958 --> 01:01:21.159]  That's all come out since then, but people try to twist that and say they weren't.
[01:01:21.619 --> 01:01:23.740]  But the point is, you should be very happy!
[01:01:24.561 --> 01:01:26.722]  Laro has been fired!
[01:01:28.503 --> 01:01:38.127]  So the neocons should be happy, and the people that don't want breakthroughs and don't want to have more information come out about 9-11, you should be extremely pleased right now.
[01:01:38.934 --> 01:01:40.236]  Stephen Jones might get fired.
[01:01:40.276 --> 01:01:40.957]  He's still on leave.
[01:01:40.977 --> 01:01:42.899]  They're talking about firing Kevin Barrett.
[01:01:42.919 --> 01:01:44.101]  Fox News again last night.
[01:01:44.121 --> 01:01:46.364]  They're calling for firing the New Hampshire professor.
[01:01:47.465 --> 01:01:52.352]  So don't worry, First Amendment, it's down on its last leg right now.
[01:01:53.053 --> 01:01:54.595]  Everything's going very nicely for you.
[01:01:56.633 --> 01:01:57.233]  Don't worry.
[01:01:57.313 --> 01:01:57.814]  Don't worry.
[01:01:57.834 --> 01:01:58.894]  They're going to have amnesty.
[01:01:59.174 --> 01:02:00.395]  They're going to have North American Union.
[01:02:00.435 --> 01:02:01.476]  Bush will take your guns.
[01:02:02.036 --> 01:02:06.078]  But you'll still be able to have plastic desecrated American flags made in China by slaves.
[01:02:06.258 --> 01:02:06.678]  Don't worry.
[01:02:06.899 --> 01:02:07.939]  You'll still have that freedom.
[01:02:08.299 --> 01:02:16.884]  You can even dress up in huge American flag outfits like some of the Kool-Aid drinking Bush cult members were doing out at Ground Zero a few weeks ago on 9-11.
[01:02:18.445 --> 01:02:22.007]  And then I mentioned it, but I want to do a little diatribe on this after we take some calls.
[01:02:22.067 --> 01:02:24.008]  Our guest will just be on with us for a segment or so.
[01:02:25.012 --> 01:02:30.453]  Take some calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[01:02:30.473 --> 01:02:30.513]  800-259-9231.
[01:02:30.673 --> 01:02:36.375]  I'm sure you've heard New York Health Board proposes ban on trans fats.
[01:02:37.695 --> 01:02:38.355]  Here's another one.
[01:02:38.395 --> 01:02:40.375]  Chicago weighs new prohibition.
[01:02:41.316 --> 01:02:42.136]  Bad for you.
[01:02:44.096 --> 01:02:45.176]  Bad for you fats.
[01:02:46.757 --> 01:02:47.877]  I pulled up another article.
[01:02:47.977 --> 01:02:49.757]  Feds want to regulate fat.
[01:02:49.777 --> 01:02:52.218]  You see you have federal officers that come regulate your fat.
[01:02:53.820 --> 01:02:56.702]  New York City moles ban on trans fats and eateries.
[01:02:57.263 --> 01:03:01.627]  Obesity surcharge is taxing to be overweight today.
[01:03:03.388 --> 01:03:06.130]  That's the kind of stuff I have here in front of me on that subject.
[01:03:06.150 --> 01:03:08.472]  And it dovetails with a control freak society.
[01:03:08.832 --> 01:03:10.374]  See, it's going to be a total prison.
[01:03:10.894 --> 01:03:12.395]  But it's all for your safety.
[01:03:12.976 --> 01:03:15.098]  Boys told no standing to urinate.
[01:03:16.899 --> 01:03:22.824]  It is a human right to not have to sit down like a girl, said a member of the Norway government.
[01:03:23.749 --> 01:03:26.751]  But, uh, they say, you know, that the boys and girls have to use the same bathroom.
[01:03:26.771 --> 01:03:27.831]  This is part of the humiliation.
[01:03:28.531 --> 01:03:29.352]  Part of the denigration.
[01:03:30.893 --> 01:03:32.033]  Part of the assault on the family.
[01:03:32.053 --> 01:03:35.175]  They want you like cult member drones in a big beehive.
[01:03:35.715 --> 01:03:37.716]  And bees don't recognize sex, folks.
[01:03:37.736 --> 01:03:42.639]  They, you know, they, they, they... I guess they go to the bathroom in the same area.
[01:03:43.399 --> 01:03:44.179]  And that's all this is.
[01:03:44.239 --> 01:03:45.380]  The giant hive.
[01:03:45.860 --> 01:03:47.621]  The human species being all altered.
[01:03:48.421 --> 01:03:50.903]  So they're gonna ban your fat and make you, make you sit.
[01:03:51.183 --> 01:03:51.823]  We'll be right back.
[01:03:56.793 --> 01:03:59.976]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[01:04:00.336 --> 01:04:02.238]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[01:04:02.638 --> 01:04:10.304]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:04:10.985 --> 01:04:18.030]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:04:18.430 --> 01:04:21.353]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran.
[01:04:21.753 --> 01:04:24.075]  A White House program to disseminate fake news.
[01:04:24.515 --> 01:04:25.296]  NSA spying.

[01:04:53.385 --> 01:04:56.407]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[01:04:56.728 --> 01:05:01.651]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[01:05:01.912 --> 01:05:06.255]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate and others are absorbed through the skin.
[01:05:06.555 --> 01:05:11.459]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron.
[01:05:11.619 --> 01:05:15.482]  And it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[01:05:15.682 --> 01:05:19.305]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[01:05:19.585 --> 01:05:24.635]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[01:05:24.916 --> 01:05:31.609]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[01:05:32.122 --> 01:05:32.782]  What about you?

[01:05:56.361 --> 01:05:58.723]  I have an urgent message for all of our listeners.
[01:05:58.803 --> 01:06:04.986]  The mass media keeps telling us that we are the richest, most powerful economy in the world.
[01:06:06.466 --> 01:06:08.768]  If this is true, why can't we pay our bills?
[01:06:09.408 --> 01:06:12.970]  Why is the United States the world's largest debtor nation?
[01:06:13.510 --> 01:06:17.632]  The truth is that we are in the worst debt bubble in our nation's history.
[01:06:18.212 --> 01:06:21.154]  When the bubble bursts, will you be able to feed your family?
[01:06:22.156 --> 01:06:25.077]  When the inevitable crash occurs, will you be ready?
[01:06:25.817 --> 01:06:31.799]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.
[01:06:31.899 --> 01:06:36.201]  That's 1-888-892-6238.

[01:06:39.442 --> 01:06:39.722]  U.S.

[01:06:53.507 --> 01:06:58.573]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:58.913 --> 01:07:01.236]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:07:03.038 --> 01:07:03.499]  Top U.S.
[01:07:03.599 --> 01:07:07.183]  official chaired North American CONFAB panel.
[01:07:08.004 --> 01:07:13.310]  Agency says he attended secretive meeting in official capacity as Assistant Secretary of State.
[01:07:13.894 --> 01:07:14.534]  Here's another one.
[01:07:14.554 --> 01:07:17.076]  Documents disclose shadow government indicate U.S.
[01:07:17.116 --> 01:07:21.098]  far advanced to constructing bureaucracy united with Mexico and Canada.
[01:07:21.598 --> 01:07:32.505]  Meanwhile, Dallas Morning News, Trans-Texas Corridor plans unveiled, but you read the article and it's got Centra, the big Spanish company, saying, hey, we don't have to tell you anything and we're not.
[01:07:33.545 --> 01:07:39.769]  Only that they're going to use $8.8 billion in taxpayer money to take over the existing roads, build new roads,
[01:07:40.643 --> 01:07:41.764]  Just wait until you hear about it.
[01:07:41.905 --> 01:07:42.886]  I mean, this is it, folks.
[01:07:42.946 --> 01:07:43.466]  It's happening.
[01:07:43.506 --> 01:07:48.092]  The looting, the subdivision, the breakdown of the country is happening right now.
[01:07:49.133 --> 01:07:50.895]  We're going into receivership is what this is.
[01:07:50.955 --> 01:07:57.542]  And we're going to get into the news about trying to send in... They're not really planning to ban fast food.
[01:07:57.562 --> 01:08:00.726]  They're just going to tax you, and it's all going to be on your new national ID card.
[01:08:00.746 --> 01:08:01.347]  We'll get into that.
[01:08:03.701 --> 01:08:08.543]  Lauro Jones Chavez, known as LJ, was a sergeant in the Army.
[01:08:08.583 --> 01:08:09.923]  He got out in late 2002.
[01:08:10.263 --> 01:08:12.504]  We have his honorable discharge, his DD-214.
[01:08:12.704 --> 01:08:16.005]  We confirmed he did work at CENTCOM.
[01:08:17.306 --> 01:08:18.226]  That's all been confirmed.
[01:08:18.246 --> 01:08:21.467]  People tried to deny that at first, and when that was proven, they went on to new stuff.
[01:08:21.968 --> 01:08:23.768]  But the neocons ought to be real happy.
[01:08:24.369 --> 01:08:31.071]  He got fired yesterday, and he worked at a computer software development company.
[01:08:31.895 --> 01:08:33.938]  He just told me how much he was making a year.
[01:08:33.998 --> 01:08:35.120]  It was quite nice.
[01:08:36.522 --> 01:08:37.544]  He was good at his job.
[01:08:38.585 --> 01:08:40.087]  He said they gave him a good reference.
[01:08:42.030 --> 01:08:45.375]  His immediate boss is a nice guy and said, I'll still give you a good reference.
[01:08:46.276 --> 01:08:47.518]  Here he is!
[01:08:47.558 --> 01:08:48.600]  Why should I tell the story?
[01:08:49.712 --> 01:08:53.875]  God bless you for taking one for the team and for the United States, Mr. Chavez.
[01:08:53.915 --> 01:08:55.115]  We appreciate your courage.
[01:08:55.536 --> 01:08:57.917]  These go-alongs and get-alongs are just unbelievable.
[01:08:59.278 --> 01:09:07.983]  Recap just super briefly what you saw at CENTCOM so folks know why this is so important and then how you went public a few months ago just with a letter to the editor.
[01:09:08.643 --> 01:09:10.324]  You didn't mean that to be your big statement.
[01:09:10.344 --> 01:09:11.905]  It was just a letter you fired off to the editor.
[01:09:12.285 --> 01:09:14.467]  Now you've clarified and expanded here on the air.
[01:09:14.867 --> 01:09:16.828]  And then tell us what happened to you yesterday.
[01:09:17.879 --> 01:09:19.259]  Oh, thanks Alex for having me on again.
[01:09:19.279 --> 01:09:25.721]  Yeah, you know, I've gotten so much negative stuff towards my letter.
[01:09:26.421 --> 01:09:28.101]  People are just taking it apart.
[01:09:28.621 --> 01:09:42.764]  The thing now, I'm just concentrating on the two points that I was there in the skiff on the morning of 9-11 and I was witness to a verbal confirmation from an Air Force liaison to NORAD that there was an order for NORAD to stand down.
[01:09:43.772 --> 01:09:51.699]  And, uh, earlier that morning I also bore witness to a top secret document, um, you know, declaring the scenarios, proposed scenarios of the war games that were going on.
[01:09:52.640 --> 01:10:00.707]  Um, and, you know, those scenarios included hijacked planes, you know, crashing into buildings to include the World Trade Center, Pentagon, uh, White House, you know, obviously.
[01:10:00.787 --> 01:10:11.296]  And, you know, and really, you know, like I say, you know, my letter was just a rant, you know, and I had no, you know, it was in no way intended to be an official statement and everybody just kind of picked it apart and, you know,
[01:10:11.914 --> 01:10:13.035]  And that's fine.
[01:10:13.115 --> 01:10:14.836]  I don't think they've picked it apart.
[01:10:14.896 --> 01:10:20.920]  I mean, they do weird little things like they say, well, he said, you know, 0400 AM.
[01:10:20.940 --> 01:10:23.002]  Well, the military doesn't say AM.
[01:10:23.122 --> 01:10:24.503]  It's admitted you were in the military.
[01:10:24.563 --> 01:10:25.584]  No one's denying that.
[01:10:25.964 --> 01:10:28.105]  I mean, it's just any way to deny.
[01:10:28.125 --> 01:10:29.406]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:10:29.426 --> 01:10:32.388]  And I think 0400 AM, I know for Mr. White, wouldn't even know what 0400 was.
[01:10:32.428 --> 01:10:33.989]  You know, it was like AM.
[01:10:34.009 --> 01:10:36.171]  You know, that's, you know, 0400 in the morning.
[01:10:36.877 --> 01:10:42.259]  So, you know, lots of things I broke down, you know, to, like, just, you know, layman's terms to Mr. White.
[01:10:42.279 --> 01:10:49.361]  Like, you know, I described it as an underground... Well, all that aside, you know, you were there, your information fits in with Norman Mineta and the other things we have.
[01:10:49.581 --> 01:10:55.843]  You know, I mean, I saw one thing debunking you, and it said, he claims Dick Cheney was in command of NORAD.
[01:10:56.203 --> 01:10:57.263]  How ridiculous!
[01:10:57.323 --> 01:11:00.124]  Here's the name of the officer who was in command of NORAD.
[01:11:00.404 --> 01:11:01.705]  You were simplifying it.
[01:11:01.765 --> 01:11:04.686]  It's not debated that two months before 9-11, in early June,
[01:11:06.884 --> 01:11:13.505]  Dick Cheney signed an order taking shoot-down powers away from NORAD and the head of NORAD.
[01:11:13.565 --> 01:11:23.587]  So see, that's what I'm mad about is the people that are out there acting like they're 9-11 truthers going after you aren't posting real questions.
[01:11:24.767 --> 01:11:28.628]  So everything I've seen they've said about you, because I've looked for real criticism.
[01:11:28.688 --> 01:11:29.768]  I called up and vetted you.
[01:11:29.848 --> 01:11:30.728]  I made phone calls.
[01:11:30.808 --> 01:11:31.488]  I checked things.
[01:11:31.848 --> 01:11:33.029]  I said, send me this document.
[01:11:33.049 --> 01:11:33.909]  Send me that document.
[01:11:34.189 --> 01:11:34.669]  You did!
[01:11:35.356 --> 01:11:37.998]  I made phone calls, so I haven't found you to be a liar yet.
[01:11:38.038 --> 01:11:40.801]  Plus, my instincts tell me you're telling the truth, and they may be wrong.
[01:11:41.021 --> 01:11:41.742]  They rarely are.
[01:11:42.642 --> 01:11:43.543]  But they are occasionally.
[01:11:44.584 --> 01:11:45.225]  It doesn't matter.
[01:11:45.485 --> 01:11:50.730]  The point is, they're not going after you and your story on real, substantive beefs.
[01:11:51.150 --> 01:11:53.432]  Now, let's get past that.
[01:11:53.992 --> 01:11:54.793]  I believe you're legit.
[01:11:54.813 --> 01:11:55.674]  The info checks out.
[01:11:55.714 --> 01:11:57.195]  We know you were at CENTCOM on that day.
[01:11:57.255 --> 01:11:57.856]  That's confirmed.
[01:11:58.276 --> 01:12:00.258]  Let's go forward to you getting fired yesterday.
[01:12:01.269 --> 01:12:05.751]  Yeah, so, you know, I came into work yesterday and, you know, I was actually starting to feel pretty good about this.
[01:12:05.771 --> 01:12:09.153]  I was like, well, you know, everything's, you know, I think everything's going to be alright.
[01:12:09.193 --> 01:12:25.781]  You know, I, you know, my, obviously my boss had pulled me in on Monday and had said, look, you know, you got our company, you know, out there on the internet and, you know, that's not a good thing because now we're getting, you know, harassing phone calls, you know, from people and, you know, and I was like, look, you know, I told him, like, I really apologize.
[01:12:25.861 --> 01:12:27.402]  It was not my intent to, you know,
[01:12:27.955 --> 01:12:28.755]  We're good to go.
[01:12:48.718 --> 01:12:52.159]  And I went into my boss's office and I sat down.
[01:12:52.179 --> 01:12:54.060]  I was a little early and I told him, am I too early?
[01:12:54.080 --> 01:12:55.020]  He's like, no, I'll be right back.
[01:12:55.080 --> 01:13:00.482]  And then him and like, you know, his boss and the HR guy like snuck in the office real fast and closed the door.
[01:13:00.502 --> 01:13:02.663]  And I just started laughing, you know what I mean?
[01:13:02.683 --> 01:13:03.823]  Because I knew what was going on.
[01:13:03.843 --> 01:13:05.764]  And I was like, you know, I told him, you guys cracked me up.
[01:13:05.824 --> 01:13:13.887]  And then, you know, they real quick spit out, well, we're having some terminations and your job, you're being terminated from the position, you know, effective immediately.
[01:13:13.907 --> 01:13:15.908]  And I was like, you know, can I ask you why?
[01:13:15.928 --> 01:13:16.828]  He's like, well, you can ask.
[01:13:17.637 --> 01:13:18.798]  And I was like, you're not going to give me a reason?
[01:13:18.818 --> 01:13:19.299]  And he's like, no.
[01:13:19.339 --> 01:13:24.023]  So I was like, well... Well, it's like Kevin Ryan at Underwriting Laboratories.
[01:13:24.363 --> 01:13:30.488]  He'd seen their internal documents where they did steel tests and found that the official story was impossible from fire.
[01:13:30.989 --> 01:13:32.190]  And he said, I'm going public.
[01:13:32.210 --> 01:13:33.711]  And they said, you go public, you're in trouble.
[01:13:33.731 --> 01:13:35.273]  He went public and they fired him.
[01:13:35.573 --> 01:13:36.674]  He's suing them right now.
[01:13:37.094 --> 01:13:39.016]  This is the new America, folks.
[01:13:39.817 --> 01:13:43.960]  And no one's doubting Kevin Ryan because we have the Underwriting Laboratory documents.
[01:13:43.980 --> 01:13:44.641]  He's an engineer.
[01:13:45.859 --> 01:13:47.799]  You know, people don't have anything to gain from this.
[01:13:47.819 --> 01:13:50.720]  LJ doesn't have anything to gain from this.
[01:13:51.060 --> 01:13:53.061]  The man we're talking to right now, Kevin Ryan didn't.
[01:13:53.381 --> 01:13:54.081]  Stephen Jones.
[01:13:54.421 --> 01:13:57.181]  They didn't have anything personally to gain except having a free country.
[01:13:57.802 --> 01:13:58.162]  Right.
[01:13:58.382 --> 01:13:59.702]  Charlie Sheen, let me say more.
[01:13:59.762 --> 01:14:03.223]  Charlie Sheen didn't have anything to gain.
[01:14:03.263 --> 01:14:06.343]  And then they wrote media hit pieces lying and slandering him.
[01:14:06.683 --> 01:14:08.864]  Now been retracted, by the way, in the worst way.
[01:14:09.716 --> 01:14:12.458]  And he could sue all these people, but he just says, I'm leaving it alone.
[01:14:12.959 --> 01:14:20.205]  I've seen him do all these other... And you know, now Jesse Ventura's gone public, and I saw some Navy SEAL site going, he's not really a Navy SEAL.
[01:14:20.265 --> 01:14:21.647]  You know, he's a traitor.
[01:14:21.707 --> 01:14:23.188]  He doesn't like the Iraq War.
[01:14:24.049 --> 01:14:28.833]  Folks, it's admitted that he was in the Navy SEALs for four years of his six years in the Navy.
[01:14:29.253 --> 01:14:30.114]  Well, that's pretty much it.
[01:14:30.134 --> 01:14:32.575]  I mean, you know, they took my badge, they took my computer immediately.
[01:14:59.658 --> 01:15:01.020]  Uh, you know, what's your procedure?
[01:15:01.040 --> 01:15:02.322]  You know, that's what I did.
[01:15:02.402 --> 01:15:04.244]  I wrote the security procedures for the company.
[01:15:04.284 --> 01:15:06.567]  So I wasn't, you know, that wasn't strange at all to me.
[01:15:07.067 --> 01:15:08.729]  You know, my account was disabled immediately.
[01:15:08.749 --> 01:15:09.831]  You know, I kind of took my time.
[01:15:10.376 --> 01:15:14.900]  You know, I played some last minute ping pong, you know, and said bye to people and everybody was like, what's going on?
[01:15:14.920 --> 01:15:25.209]  You know, I was like, well, I'm sure eventually it'll unfold, you know, as to why, you know, they won't tell me, but maybe somebody will tell somebody that'll filter down and be like, yeah, you know, just bad publicity to the company.
[01:15:25.269 --> 01:15:27.551]  We weren't willing to, they weren't willing to protect me.
[01:15:27.571 --> 01:15:28.111]  You know what I mean?
[01:15:28.291 --> 01:15:31.574]  You know, obviously the business was more important than, you know, what I was trying to do.
[01:15:31.974 --> 01:15:34.917]  Yeah, but this would have blown, you know, this would have blown over.
[01:15:36.129 --> 01:15:36.890]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:15:36.910 --> 01:15:37.810]  I totally agree.
[01:15:37.850 --> 01:15:38.391]  I think it would have.
[01:15:38.431 --> 01:15:40.532]  What type of software did they do?
[01:15:40.572 --> 01:15:42.633]  Because you said there were some investors that were military.
[01:15:43.734 --> 01:15:44.014]  Right.
[01:15:44.355 --> 01:15:45.816]  It's property management software.
[01:15:47.617 --> 01:15:57.664]  I was told a while back that one of the key investors was an ex-military member that was very, very well off or whatnot.
[01:15:57.704 --> 01:15:58.945]  That could have something to do with it.
[01:15:59.025 --> 01:16:04.728]  Obviously, the directives to terminate me came from probably the owner of the company.
[01:16:05.891 --> 01:16:09.495]  They're still up and coming, and obviously the negative publicity could probably hurt them.
[01:16:09.735 --> 01:16:13.799]  Was the owner in the room?
[01:16:13.859 --> 01:16:14.560]  No, of course not.
[01:16:14.580 --> 01:16:15.260]  Not at all.
[01:16:15.280 --> 01:16:18.083]  I don't even know if he was there that day at all.
[01:16:18.884 --> 01:16:20.265]  So, I have no clue.
[01:16:20.746 --> 01:16:25.591]  Well, I'm sure the neocons are happy, because this is their tactic to stop free speech.
[01:16:26.448 --> 01:16:26.768]  Absolutely.
[01:16:26.788 --> 01:16:28.009]  What's happening to the Constitution?
[01:16:28.029 --> 01:16:30.411]  Well, I mean, your fault is, is you did that yourself.
[01:16:30.451 --> 01:16:36.955]  You were telling them, hey, I worked in the military, I did internet security there, I work here, do internet security now.
[01:16:37.435 --> 01:16:43.378]  I'm telling you, this is, you know, some of the things we witnessed, and it's incredible.
[01:16:43.679 --> 01:16:44.899]  It's absolutely incredible.
[01:16:45.560 --> 01:16:46.821]  Well, I'm sure it's not over yet.
[01:16:46.841 --> 01:16:49.822]  I mean, by the time they're done with me, it'll probably end up that I was never in the military.
[01:16:50.403 --> 01:16:53.425]  I mean, I have no idea of, you know, the lengths that these people are willing to go to, so...
[01:16:54.377 --> 01:17:00.947]  You know, I got recommended by somebody to do a Dead Man's Twitch, I guess, which is a taped testimony, and then send it out to, like, eight of my friends, and...
[01:17:01.562 --> 01:17:03.703]  Have them hold on to it.
[01:17:04.083 --> 01:17:07.724]  Can you videotape yourself, maybe five minutes, and then email it to us?
[01:17:08.165 --> 01:17:09.265]  Yeah, I'm working on that.
[01:17:09.345 --> 01:17:14.287]  I've actually got an individual come up here to get my testimony on actual videotapes, so people can see me.
[01:17:14.707 --> 01:17:15.327]  Who is that?
[01:17:15.367 --> 01:17:16.888]  Who are they with?
[01:17:17.028 --> 01:17:19.789]  Actually, it was Dave from the Power Hour.
[01:17:19.809 --> 01:17:22.330]  He wanted me to come down, or to come up here.
[01:17:22.430 --> 01:17:26.652]  We're trying to work out the details, but he's got a professional videographer.
[01:17:26.672 --> 01:17:29.093]  Oh yeah, I know Dave well.
[01:17:30.094 --> 01:17:30.755]  Red American.
[01:17:31.656 --> 01:17:32.357]  Well, that's good.
[01:17:32.497 --> 01:17:32.978]  That's good.
[01:17:32.998 --> 01:17:36.122]  They need to do that as quickly as possible.
[01:17:36.423 --> 01:17:40.328]  I recommend you do that with them, but it's better to get something out there.
[01:17:40.548 --> 01:17:41.910]  I mean, you're doing it here on air.
[01:17:41.930 --> 01:17:43.753]  Why don't you just go ahead and do it here on air right now?
[01:17:45.043 --> 01:17:48.024]  Well, yeah, absolutely.
[01:17:48.044 --> 01:17:49.925]  I mean, I did make a video yesterday.
[01:17:49.945 --> 01:17:56.827]  It was about eight minutes long, and I overnighted eight copies to not family members.
[01:17:56.967 --> 01:18:01.248]  One was a family member, and the rest were friends that I trust most all over the country.
[01:18:01.268 --> 01:18:03.329]  Will you do me a favor and overnight that to me?
[01:18:04.409 --> 01:18:05.330]  Absolutely.
[01:18:05.390 --> 01:18:06.050]  I'll do my best.
[01:18:06.090 --> 01:18:09.251]  I've got to get some more copies of it out off the PC and burner.
[01:18:09.291 --> 01:18:10.691]  I've got to go buy more CDs.
[01:18:10.731 --> 01:18:12.092]  I was going to send it out to like 20 people,
[01:18:12.699 --> 01:18:14.580]  You know, in a field envelope is what it's saying.
[01:18:14.600 --> 01:18:16.120]  I want to keep you for one more segment.
[01:18:16.340 --> 01:18:20.502]  You do internet security, IT security, company security.
[01:18:20.842 --> 01:18:21.842]  Somebody needs to hire you.
[01:18:21.862 --> 01:18:22.983]  You live in Cincinnati, right?
[01:18:23.443 --> 01:18:23.963]  That is correct.
[01:18:24.563 --> 01:18:27.144]  Somebody in that area listening needs to give you a job.
[01:18:28.905 --> 01:18:29.465]  But you know what?
[01:18:29.485 --> 01:18:32.406]  You may go through a tribulation now, but you'll be blessed down the line.
[01:18:32.866 --> 01:18:33.766]  You've done the right thing.
[01:18:34.387 --> 01:18:36.147]  Stay there, LJ.
[01:18:36.167 --> 01:18:39.268]  We're talking to Laurel Jones Chavez.
[01:18:40.329 --> 01:18:40.769]  Fired.

[01:19:55.103 --> 01:19:57.424]  Hi folks, Jack Browner from Midas Resources.
[01:19:57.745 --> 01:19:58.765]  The real money folks.
[01:20:02.067 --> 01:20:03.988]  Let's review a few things from the past year.
[01:20:04.488 --> 01:20:05.469]  November 2003 to November 2004.
[01:20:05.549 --> 01:20:06.930]  The Dow has ranged from 9,800 to 10,300.
[01:20:06.970 --> 01:20:07.390]  A 5% increase.
[01:20:07.991 --> 01:20:11.072]  The dollar's value has dropped from 96 cents to 70 cents against the year old.
[01:20:11.593 --> 01:20:14.154]  A 24% decrease in spending power against the gold back year old.
[01:20:23.308 --> 01:20:28.951]  Gold has gone from the 390s to the 440s, a 16% increase in real money.
[01:20:29.551 --> 01:20:32.572]  Precious metals are the safe haven in today's hectic marketplace.

[01:20:54.213 --> 01:20:56.674]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[01:20:57.435 --> 01:21:03.057]  Over the last 40 years, we've seen prayer and God thrown out of the schools by decisions of the U.S.
[01:21:03.097 --> 01:21:03.858]  Supreme Court.
[01:21:04.638 --> 01:21:08.940]  Yet on February 29, 1892, in a 9-0 decision of the U.S.
[01:21:08.960 --> 01:21:12.602]  Supreme Court, America was declared a Christian nation.
[01:21:13.562 --> 01:21:18.785]  There is an ongoing assault on your First Amendment right of freedom of religion and freedom of assembly.
[01:21:19.611 --> 01:21:27.916]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[01:21:44.084 --> 01:21:56.512]  Hello, this is Amy Bjorklund.
[01:21:56.692 --> 01:21:59.293]  Are you totally satisfied with the nourishment you're getting?
[01:21:59.393 --> 01:22:02.415]  Do you have enough energy to do everything you really want to do?
[01:22:02.655 --> 01:22:06.117]  And are you content to remain in your current state of health indefinitely?
[01:22:06.397 --> 01:22:12.241]  Have you already tried diets, exercise, vitamins, juicing, or the latest greatest nutritional wonder products?
[01:22:12.581 --> 01:22:17.363]  Perhaps those things have grown tiresome and not made you feel and look as well as you'd really like to.
[01:22:17.603 --> 01:22:28.008]  But what if you found from a single source the world's freshest, purest, most complete, whole, live food nourishment that tastes delicious and couldn't be any easier to consume?
[01:22:28.288 --> 01:22:29.569]  Well, you just did.
[01:22:29.929 --> 01:22:30.889]  So don't hesitate.

[01:22:44.555 --> 01:22:44.595]  805-595-2711.
[01:22:44.615 --> 01:22:46.156]  Laurel Jones Chavez, LJ, with us right now.
[01:23:10.083 --> 01:23:14.585]  So just for the record, do you want to state that you're not suicidal and that you're not planning to jump off a bridge?
[01:23:15.345 --> 01:23:16.506]  I am not suicidal.
[01:23:16.586 --> 01:23:18.967]  I am definitely not planning to jump off a bridge, Alex.
[01:23:19.027 --> 01:23:20.328]  I'm very content with my life.
[01:23:20.948 --> 01:23:27.371]  I think everything happens for a reason and, you know, I'm really relieved that I've gotten, you know, some of these things off my chest to the public so that...
[01:23:27.871 --> 01:23:32.255]  You know, maybe we can get another foot forward in this battle that we're involved in here.
[01:23:32.335 --> 01:23:33.276]  And yeah, no way.
[01:23:33.296 --> 01:23:34.877]  I'm an excellent driver.
[01:23:34.897 --> 01:23:36.979]  My Jeep checks out.
[01:23:37.059 --> 01:23:42.023]  So, you know, if you read about me in a fireball on the highway, that was totally something done by somebody else.
[01:23:42.304 --> 01:23:46.027]  Yeah, well, there's a lot of people, and I just want you to know this, who live in fear.
[01:23:46.047 --> 01:23:49.550]  And there's a whole cult of fear, running around in fear.
[01:23:50.010 --> 01:23:52.753]  And sure, we can get killed doing this, and patriots have been killed.
[01:23:53.133 --> 01:23:55.115]  But I think when you have the attitude of not caring,
[01:23:55.655 --> 01:23:55.855]  Thank you.
[01:24:14.858 --> 01:24:20.243]  Right, and that's what I see happening, you know, and I'm, you know, like I told the individuals that have, you know, given me warnings or whatever to, like, be safe.
[01:24:20.343 --> 01:24:25.908]  I'm like, you know, I'm not going to, I'm not going to bunker myself in my house and, you know, try to act like some creep that, you know, is scared to go outside.
[01:24:25.948 --> 01:24:27.829]  Yeah, that's, that's actually how they get you.
[01:24:28.390 --> 01:24:34.035]  And then once you put yourself into that position, it's, most people doing that aren't feds trying to scare you.
[01:24:34.395 --> 01:24:37.318]  They're either paranoid or it's their way of trying to get close to you.
[01:24:37.778 --> 01:24:39.019]  Oh, you can trust me.
[01:24:39.079 --> 01:24:40.901]  I'm telling you about how much danger you're in.
[01:24:41.602 --> 01:24:42.082]  Right, right.
[01:24:42.102 --> 01:24:43.203]  Believe me, I've heard it all before.
[01:24:43.223 --> 01:24:47.485]  The mind fabricates fear and I'm in no way scared to, uh... Exactly.
[01:24:47.505 --> 01:25:06.694]  ...clean my maker, so... Well, listen, I mean, when I drive down the highway and I'm going 85 miles an hour with 18-wheelers on both sides of me and a concrete embankment, uh, you know, or let's say an 18-wheeler behind me and an 18-wheeler beside me and a concrete embankment five inches away, you know, I don't have fear, but I go, hey, this is pretty serious, I better pay attention.
[01:25:07.373 --> 01:25:09.334]  Soccer moms don't.
[01:25:10.174 --> 01:25:12.295]  Or, you know, cops aren't afraid of that.
[01:25:12.335 --> 01:25:14.596]  They're afraid of what they're told to be afraid of.
[01:25:14.796 --> 01:25:22.058]  Al-Cieda and, oh, you know, the evil government's going to come kill you and all of this stuff.
[01:25:22.339 --> 01:25:23.619]  Bush announcing torture.
[01:25:23.639 --> 01:25:25.180]  Bush announcing they spy on us.
[01:25:25.540 --> 01:25:26.680]  Announcing FEMA camps.
[01:25:26.740 --> 01:25:28.321]  That's actually meant to scare us!
[01:25:29.881 --> 01:25:30.542]  Do you see what I'm saying?
[01:25:31.122 --> 01:25:31.662]  Absolutely.
[01:25:31.702 --> 01:25:33.983]  I think that, you know, even if they wanted to
[01:25:34.921 --> 01:25:44.043]  Yeah, it would be a bad move on their part because that would just prove to everybody that obviously I was telling the truth and that would make things so much worse because this guy comes out and then he gets killed.
[01:25:44.283 --> 01:25:49.304]  What they'll do is they'll have one of your new close friends come out and say, well he did tell me he was depressed.
[01:25:49.964 --> 01:25:51.665]  Right.
[01:25:52.065 --> 01:25:54.005]  I shot myself in the head somehow three times.
[01:25:54.025 --> 01:25:54.825]  I don't know how that works.
[01:25:55.005 --> 01:26:00.747]  Yeah, we'll get a call from somebody we trust.
[01:26:00.907 --> 01:26:02.387]  Oh, he told me he was going to do it.
[01:26:03.729 --> 01:26:06.032]  Yeah, that's how it works.
[01:26:06.192 --> 01:26:06.833]  Clearly not.
[01:26:06.853 --> 01:26:07.253]  No, no, no.
[01:26:07.293 --> 01:26:14.762]  I'm still, you know, enjoying the weather, driving around my windows down with the top off my Jeep, you know, enjoying the last of the sunshine down up here in Florida.
[01:26:14.782 --> 01:26:17.905]  You know, LJ had just lost his job.
[01:26:17.945 --> 01:26:18.986]  He was depressed.
[01:26:27.359 --> 01:26:28.500]  You're going to be just fine.
[01:26:28.780 --> 01:26:29.801]  You're going to be just fine.
[01:26:29.821 --> 01:26:33.023]  Obviously you're going to be looking around for a job now.
[01:26:33.804 --> 01:26:35.065]  Are you planning to stay in Ohio?
[01:26:36.583 --> 01:26:37.503]  I want to.
[01:26:37.523 --> 01:26:40.946]  There's been talks between me and my brother.
[01:26:40.966 --> 01:26:43.868]  We want to move to Colorado in the future.
[01:26:44.608 --> 01:26:47.470]  I don't believe in coincidence at all anymore.
[01:26:47.630 --> 01:26:49.171]  Things happen for a reason.
[01:26:49.271 --> 01:26:51.313]  I'm glad that I could do something right.
[01:26:51.933 --> 01:26:54.095]  If I put my career on the line for that, that's fine.
[01:26:54.175 --> 01:26:55.556]  As long as that doesn't go
[01:26:56.571 --> 01:27:01.635]  Unnoticed, you know, and maybe can spark, you know, other people to come out, you know, because I know there are other military members that were there that day.
[01:27:01.696 --> 01:27:05.739]  I know that there are other military members at other bases that saw things, just like I saw things.
[01:27:05.779 --> 01:27:08.441]  No, there's no North American Union.
[01:27:08.481 --> 01:27:10.963]  There's no Chinese organ harvesting.
[01:27:11.204 --> 01:27:12.925]  There was no Tuskegee experiments.
[01:27:12.985 --> 01:27:14.066]  DU's good for you.
[01:27:14.106 --> 01:27:15.067]  Mercury's good for you.
[01:27:15.567 --> 01:27:17.229]  Why don't you just tell us Dick Cheney's good?
[01:27:19.030 --> 01:27:19.530]  I will not.
[01:27:19.590 --> 01:27:20.831]  That will come from my mouth.
[01:27:21.431 --> 01:27:26.392]  What I can't believe is that the people trying to debunk you say, he says Dick Cheney took control of NORAD.
[01:27:26.812 --> 01:27:28.832]  Dick Cheney, here's the name of the commander.
[01:27:29.492 --> 01:27:34.393]  It's an admitted, executed order that took the shoot-down power away from NORAD.
[01:27:34.413 --> 01:27:36.113]  I mean, that's admitted.
[01:27:36.133 --> 01:27:38.954]  They just, again, it's incredible.
[01:27:39.454 --> 01:27:42.395]  Yeah, I think part of the problem is that, you know, the 9-11, the truth movement is so, like,
[01:27:44.721 --> 01:27:45.702]  They're not organized yet.
[01:27:45.722 --> 01:27:47.703]  You know, they're still battling amongst themselves.
[01:27:47.763 --> 01:27:49.023]  I see a lot of that in the blogs.
[01:27:49.103 --> 01:27:50.384]  Everybody's still fighting amongst each other.
[01:27:50.404 --> 01:27:58.128]  Well, that has to happen, though, in a way, because there's disinformation artists out there on purpose coming up with bad, bad theories to then discredit us.
[01:27:58.649 --> 01:28:02.711]  And if you notice, those are the people who you see on the news over and over and over again.
[01:28:03.551 --> 01:28:07.994]  Either they're useful idiots or they're operatives, and they have them on because they can be debunked.
[01:28:08.667 --> 01:28:09.007]  Right.
[01:28:09.588 --> 01:28:10.168]  Exactly.
[01:28:10.228 --> 01:28:12.629]  But, you know, we need to unify.
[01:28:12.989 --> 01:28:18.212]  Well, because people have seen this info, then they get overly and they start, you know, jumping in shadows.
[01:28:18.773 --> 01:28:27.057]  Listen, do you want to give out your contact info for folks that, I mean, an email address or something, people that want to support you or get in contact with you or job opportunities?
[01:28:27.558 --> 01:28:27.818]  Sure.
[01:28:27.878 --> 01:28:31.740]  My email address is waro, L-A-U-R-O, dot,

[01:28:41.693 --> 01:28:41.973]  Stay there.
[01:28:41.993 --> 01:28:42.854]  I want to talk to you during the break.

[01:30:55.768 --> 01:30:59.911]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass?
[01:31:00.131 --> 01:31:01.892]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[01:31:02.152 --> 01:31:08.436]  If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough, the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[01:31:08.737 --> 01:31:14.861]  Using this similar principle, Royal Raymond Rife discovered that diseased organisms can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.

[01:32:00.866 --> 01:32:03.227]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:32:03.247 --> 01:32:19.157]  Yeah, I think it's fine to vet people and to not believe them and to research them.
[01:32:22.084 --> 01:32:25.127]  I've even been burned once or twice by people I've had on the show.
[01:32:27.549 --> 01:32:28.430]  I mean, that's going to happen.
[01:32:28.450 --> 01:32:29.611]  You do interviews every day.
[01:32:29.651 --> 01:32:30.812]  You do research.
[01:32:31.072 --> 01:32:39.459]  But with LJ, Laro Jones Chavez, nicknamed LJ, he really was in the military.
[01:32:39.479 --> 01:32:40.319]  We made phone calls.
[01:32:40.339 --> 01:32:41.220]  We confirmed that.
[01:32:41.320 --> 01:32:43.762]  We found stuff on the web about him.
[01:32:43.802 --> 01:32:44.623]  We found his picture.
[01:32:45.404 --> 01:32:47.665]  He sent us in like five minutes.
[01:32:47.745 --> 01:32:48.866]  He couldn't just make a... I said,
[01:32:50.458 --> 01:32:51.679]  I was talking to one of my military friends.
[01:32:51.719 --> 01:32:53.039]  He said, ask for his DD-214.
[01:32:53.059 --> 01:32:54.680]  I go, hey!
[01:32:55.160 --> 01:32:55.720]  Call him back.
[01:32:55.740 --> 01:32:58.221]  Send me your DD-214 and you send it right now.
[01:32:58.301 --> 01:32:59.122]  You say you're at home.
[01:32:59.522 --> 01:33:02.063]  Yeah, okay, let me dig it out of a file and send it to you.
[01:33:02.143 --> 01:33:02.463]  Boom!
[01:33:02.943 --> 01:33:05.444]  Five minutes later, we had it.
[01:33:05.625 --> 01:33:09.606]  Couldn't fake it that fast unless he already had the fake one ready.
[01:33:09.626 --> 01:33:12.167]  No, it's a classic story.
[01:33:12.227 --> 01:33:18.350]  He wrote the letter to the editor because his friend wrote one that was this 9-11 hit piece on the 9-11 truth movement.
[01:33:19.415 --> 01:33:21.356]  His friend wrote one and said, look at the Cincinnati Post.
[01:33:21.376 --> 01:33:22.076]  You ought to write one.
[01:33:22.456 --> 01:33:25.657]  So he, in like 15 minutes, writes this big long letter to the editor.
[01:33:26.838 --> 01:33:29.239]  And then he decides to put it on a MySpace account.
[01:33:29.619 --> 01:33:30.879]  And no one pays attention to it.
[01:33:30.899 --> 01:33:32.380]  Then it gets picked up by Rents.
[01:33:32.860 --> 01:33:34.000]  It goes supernova.
[01:33:34.921 --> 01:33:37.882]  And I call him up Monday morning and say, will you come on?
[01:33:37.942 --> 01:33:40.262]  And meanwhile, Paul was vetting him.
[01:33:40.282 --> 01:33:43.504]  He had already written an article questioning, you know, saying, people are questioning.
[01:33:43.544 --> 01:33:44.504]  Let's do more research.
[01:33:45.408 --> 01:33:46.349]  And I had him on.
[01:33:46.369 --> 01:33:49.612]  He gave us his DD-214, his discharge, honorable discharge.
[01:33:50.152 --> 01:33:51.553]  Then we made phone calls that day.
[01:33:52.154 --> 01:33:54.716]  And then the people going after him were nitpicking.
[01:33:56.217 --> 01:34:03.103]  And one of the most blaring was, he says, Dick Cheney was in control and commanded NORAD.
[01:34:03.123 --> 01:34:04.704]  Well, here's the name of the commander!
[01:34:04.724 --> 01:34:07.747]  See, that's a straw man attack.
[01:34:09.466 --> 01:34:13.949]  That's taking what he said semantically and manipulating it, because he said Cheney was in command.
[01:34:13.989 --> 01:34:15.550]  Well, Cheney WAS in command.
[01:34:15.930 --> 01:34:21.114]  Just because you can go show some, quote, commander of NORAD, Cheney is his commander!
[01:34:21.994 --> 01:34:26.677]  And Cheney took specific control months before 9-11, what, June 3rd?
[01:34:27.317 --> 01:34:29.759]  It's all over, it's on the Pentagon's own website!
[01:34:30.820 --> 01:34:32.221]  With the Pentagon SEALED!
[01:34:32.561 --> 01:34:34.242]  Signed by Dick Cheney!
[01:34:35.109 --> 01:34:40.014]  Issued then to the Department of Defense by Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld!
[01:34:41.235 --> 01:34:42.477]  It's been in the newspaper!
[01:34:44.319 --> 01:34:45.440]  And so it's frustrating.
[01:34:47.021 --> 01:34:52.267]  Alright, I gave the phone number out, and we're going to take your calls coming up here in a few minutes at 1-800-259-9231.
[01:34:52.347 --> 01:34:54.349]  In fact, who is up first in this big list?
[01:34:59.975 --> 01:35:00.895]  Okay, alright.
[01:35:01.456 --> 01:35:05.698]  Yeah, actually I did fire the number out in the segment.
[01:35:05.738 --> 01:35:08.819]  We opened the phones up at three minutes into the show.
[01:35:09.620 --> 01:35:10.260]  Just on record.
[01:35:11.240 --> 01:35:13.922]  Because I don't want to get into an argument about it, but that's fine.
[01:35:14.362 --> 01:35:17.924]  We'll go to your calls coming up here near the end of this segment.
[01:35:17.944 --> 01:35:18.724]  1-800-259-9231, baby!
[01:35:18.784 --> 01:35:19.084]  Alright.
[01:35:19.244 --> 01:35:21.785]  I'm mad about people getting fired, folks.
[01:35:29.753 --> 01:35:33.314]  I'm mad about what's happening in this country.
[01:35:35.115 --> 01:35:39.016]  I'm mad about the unraveling of our society.
[01:35:40.256 --> 01:35:41.417]  And I have to control myself.
[01:35:41.597 --> 01:35:44.538]  I can't get angry.
[01:35:45.258 --> 01:35:48.699]  And you're welcome to comment on all the North American Union news coming out.
[01:35:49.321 --> 01:35:51.843]  You're welcome to comment on the audio at the big hospital.
[01:35:52.104 --> 01:35:56.648]  Ah yes, we have the executions and the holiday and the society controlling mechanism.
[01:35:56.668 --> 01:35:57.429]  We have plenty of organs.
[01:35:57.749 --> 01:36:04.696]  You're welcome to talk about how in countries they're trying to ban in schools boys standing to use the bathroom to urinate.
[01:36:05.316 --> 01:36:07.779]  How they're trying to ban and restrict fast food.
[01:36:07.799 --> 01:36:09.000]  It won't end there.
[01:36:10.161 --> 01:36:13.264]  But the first big news I want to now get to
[01:36:17.563 --> 01:36:26.209]  The first piece of information I want to get to is the disinformation out of Reuters.
[01:36:26.469 --> 01:36:27.189]  Look at this headline.
[01:36:29.051 --> 01:36:35.175]  More could be deemed enemy combatants under Bill Reuters.
[01:36:36.423 --> 01:36:47.048]  The United States could detain more foreigners as enemy combatants under legislation Congress is expected to debate this week after a last-minute change in the bill lawmakers said on Tuesday.
[01:36:47.448 --> 01:36:57.493]  Democrats complained that Republicans quietly made several changes to the bill defining procedures for trying foreign terrorism suspects after an agreement last week between the White House and a group of dissident Republican senators.
[01:36:57.973 --> 01:37:02.954]  There are significant changes, said Senator Carl Levin of Michigan, the top Democrat of the Armed Services Committee.
[01:37:02.974 --> 01:37:10.276]  He said the new elements would complicate efforts to push the bill through Congress before lawmakers leave this weekend to campaign for November elections.
[01:37:10.636 --> 01:37:20.919]  Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, a key negotiator to the bill, said enemy combatants would now include those who provided money, weapons, and other support for terrorist groups, as well as those involved in actual operations.
[01:37:21.179 --> 01:37:24.760]  And that means people who gave money to Muslim charities that was then linked, or any other charity.
[01:37:26.132 --> 01:37:32.077]  Graham of South Carolina said the term enemy combatant would also apply to those fighting a U.S.
[01:37:32.197 --> 01:37:32.518]  ally.
[01:37:33.278 --> 01:37:39.464]  We're making sure that an enemy combatant could be defined as someone other than a frontline troop, Graham said.
[01:37:39.724 --> 01:37:44.709]  We want to make sure that giving material aid to support terrorism would put you in the enemy combatant category.
[01:37:45.189 --> 01:37:45.950]  He added that U.S.
[01:37:45.990 --> 01:37:48.452]  citizens could not be deemed enemy combatants under the bill.
[01:37:49.930 --> 01:37:54.573]  Okay, you can go pull previous mainstream news articles from two weeks ago saying U.S.
[01:37:54.613 --> 01:38:00.356]  citizens can be secretly arrested and secretly tried by a tribunal and can be rendered in rendition.
[01:38:03.678 --> 01:38:13.003]  So, when you're faced with a lie this big, it's really hard to deal with.
[01:38:14.824 --> 01:38:17.946]  There have been three different versions of this bill in the last week and a half.
[01:38:19.313 --> 01:38:24.137]  And the new version of H.R.
[01:38:24.157 --> 01:38:35.265]  6054, which is only one part of the, there's another bill, is, let me give you the exact link, is 80 pages.
[01:38:36.927 --> 01:38:37.827]  Or the printer ran out.
[01:38:38.028 --> 01:38:42.431]  It's 80 something actually, I don't even, and this is, this is not even the whole bill.
[01:38:42.691 --> 01:38:43.912]  Okay, I guess the printer ran out.
[01:38:44.473 --> 01:38:46.154]  I got 80 pages, it's 80 something pages.
[01:38:47.637 --> 01:38:49.298]  And what you do is keyword search is in here.
[01:38:49.318 --> 01:38:51.539]  So I keyword search U.S.
[01:38:51.579 --> 01:38:54.461]  citizen, enemy combatant.
[01:38:54.561 --> 01:38:55.462]  I scan through the bill.
[01:38:56.823 --> 01:39:07.849]  And what made me do this this morning, because I hadn't looked at this in a couple days, was this email that says, below is the results of your feedback form.
[01:39:07.949 --> 01:39:10.751]  Oh, I guess we have that feedback form thing on our website now.
[01:39:11.491 --> 01:39:12.072]  He didn't write that.
[01:39:12.112 --> 01:39:12.752]  It's just comments.
[01:39:13.613 --> 01:39:23.475]  So I heard much ballyhoo on the news about how congressmen were saying that the new Military Commission Act of 2006 would protect U.S.
[01:39:23.515 --> 01:39:26.656]  citizens from being classified as enemy combatants.
[01:39:26.696 --> 01:39:29.536]  Well, being the cynic that I am, I wanted to see for myself.
[01:39:30.737 --> 01:39:38.278]  It took me a while to find it, since they haven't exactly publicized the name of the bill, but I found it, downloaded it from the government printing office.
[01:39:38.298 --> 01:39:39.458]  You can retrieve it here.
[01:39:39.498 --> 01:39:41.839]  We put a link to it up on InfoWars.com.
[01:39:43.386 --> 01:39:52.974]  If you look at page 3, section 948A, definitions, you see the definition of unlawful enemy combatant, kind of a misnomer, really, I mean, is there a lawful enemy combatant?
[01:39:53.935 --> 01:39:58.779]  Then you will see there is this, there's nothing in there that excludes U.S.
[01:39:58.819 --> 01:40:00.360]  citizens from being deemed as such.
[01:40:00.740 --> 01:40:08.066]  In fact, the cursory search of the document shows the reference to the word citizen in the context of the law is related to citizen council.
[01:40:08.887 --> 01:40:12.570]  I have not fully read the law yet, I'll get it to you later today, in any case,
[01:40:13.203 --> 01:40:14.784]  They have attempted to spin this again.
[01:40:14.804 --> 01:40:18.525]  I will look for the Senate version later and see what the differences are.
[01:40:18.746 --> 01:40:20.006]  And I did go pull that one.
[01:40:21.467 --> 01:40:22.747]  And I did spend time on this.
[01:40:23.608 --> 01:40:26.109]  And let me now report to you what is in this.
[01:40:29.751 --> 01:40:31.231]  It is classic Bill Clinton.
[01:40:31.271 --> 01:40:33.532]  It depends on what the definition of is is.
[01:40:33.552 --> 01:40:35.433]  Okay?
[01:40:37.354 --> 01:40:40.636]  And to boil it down, it's like the government saying 15 million times, we
[01:40:42.145 --> 01:40:44.185]  Have to have warrants to spy on you.
[01:40:44.306 --> 01:40:47.746]  Don't worry, the Patriot Act doesn't violate the Fourth Amendment.
[01:40:48.006 --> 01:40:50.207]  We have Bush on tape saying that over and over again.
[01:40:50.227 --> 01:40:50.947]  We've played it here.
[01:40:51.327 --> 01:41:00.149]  And then he comes out and says, well, we don't need warrants because, you know, we've got a bill introduced right now that's passing the Senate that allows total, unlimited surveillance of the American people.
[01:41:01.609 --> 01:41:02.790]  They're already doing it.
[01:41:02.810 --> 01:41:05.110]  Now they just want to codify it because they can get in trouble for it.
[01:41:05.270 --> 01:41:06.270]  They're worried about impeachment.
[01:41:08.371 --> 01:41:09.331]  And it's the same thing here.
[01:41:12.190 --> 01:41:13.951]  And they just do this stuff over and over again.
[01:41:13.991 --> 01:41:20.433]  But when you read the definitions on page 5 and page 20, let me just turn to them.
[01:41:20.473 --> 01:41:23.295]  I was in such a hurry this morning, I didn't get all of this marked.
[01:41:23.375 --> 01:41:25.195]  I just broke the basic pages it was on.
[01:41:27.796 --> 01:41:36.780]  And it says in here, when you look at the term citizen, that if you've been deemed to be a citizen, they deem that.
[01:41:38.351 --> 01:41:44.912]  That you can be secretly arrested, but that you will then be allowed to have civilian counsel in the military tribune.
[01:41:46.133 --> 01:41:48.073]  If not, you get secret military counsel.
[01:41:49.993 --> 01:42:03.016]  But the problem is, what they've always stated in the memos and Bush's announcement, where he said, I don't need a law, I just say it in his law, is that, now this is key, listen up carefully on this, I know I'm babbling, it's complex.
[01:42:04.717 --> 01:42:06.917]  They decide if you're an enemy combatant,
[01:42:07.592 --> 01:42:12.074]  And then when you are designated an enemy combatant, you are stripped of U.S.
[01:42:12.114 --> 01:42:12.795]  citizenship.
[01:42:15.116 --> 01:42:15.496]  Okay?
[01:42:15.836 --> 01:42:18.898]  Remember, you've heard them all over the news, you've read the news articles, we've talked about it constantly.
[01:42:19.158 --> 01:42:22.040]  Back when Bush said he didn't need Congress, he didn't need the Supreme Court, now he's in trouble.
[01:42:22.240 --> 01:42:25.822]  Now he's going, okay, I'll get it passed through Congress, but I still have the right to do it anyways.
[01:42:27.122 --> 01:42:27.583]  Remember that?
[01:42:28.243 --> 01:42:32.465]  They said that we decide if we're an enemy combatant, and we will strip U.S.
[01:42:32.505 --> 01:42:35.947]  citizens of their citizenship and designate them as such.
[01:42:37.111 --> 01:42:39.812]  So not only does it not ever say in here that U.S.
[01:42:39.852 --> 01:42:51.178]  citizens can't be secretly arrested, secretly tried, it also says that it's not admissible in court, in these courts that aren't even courts to begin with, if you've been tortured, if you've been rendered, if you've been interrogated.
[01:42:51.198 --> 01:42:57.281]  Of course there's no torture, because they now call torture, pressure.
[01:42:59.182 --> 01:43:04.044]  And I wrote my analysis of Patriot Act II, and it took me a couple days to do it back in 2002.
[01:43:06.659 --> 01:43:07.440]  Or 2003.
[01:43:09.402 --> 01:43:11.424]  And I did win the Project Censored Award for that.
[01:43:11.604 --> 01:43:13.266]  It was a good piece of analysis.
[01:43:14.427 --> 01:43:18.030]  And the problem is they keep changing this bill every four or five days in the last week and a half.
[01:43:18.070 --> 01:43:19.612]  I changed it three times last week and a half.
[01:43:21.494 --> 01:43:22.675]  And this is the latest version.
[01:43:23.747 --> 01:43:47.618]  and it says no protections no nothing and there's a bunch of other weird mumbo-jumbo about enemy combatant designation and it just says anyone anywhere who materially aids terrorists or materially aids those that are aiding terrorists and then you look at the definition of terrorism and its practice not just section 802 that it's now any action that endangers human life that's a violation of any federal or state law
[01:43:48.795 --> 01:43:52.397]  Or any political action that is designed to influence a public official.
[01:43:53.097 --> 01:43:54.597]  That's the new definition.
[01:43:54.798 --> 01:44:00.940]  In the past it was carrying out violent acts to influence policies or populations.
[01:44:02.200 --> 01:44:09.623]  Now it isn't blowing up buses or blowing up trains or blowing up shopping malls or shooting crowds of Sunday school children.
[01:44:10.004 --> 01:44:10.584]  Now it's
[01:44:12.344 --> 01:44:20.946]  Well, I mean, there was a New York Times article a few months ago, we've been telling you about it for years, but finally it's in the New York Times, that Patriot Act increasingly being used in non-care cases!
[01:44:23.726 --> 01:44:26.026]  And it listed dozens of examples.
[01:44:27.667 --> 01:44:32.047]  I kind of just go from rote to stuff they were doing four years ago, there's been so much since then.
[01:44:32.428 --> 01:44:36.648]  You always say topless bars, county commissioners, pot dealers, those were some of the first cases.
[01:44:37.028 --> 01:44:38.589]  Now there have been thousands that we know about.
[01:44:38.629 --> 01:44:40.809]  I mean, it's sleeping on park benches, it's
[01:44:43.075 --> 01:44:49.902]  It's getting in a fist fight, it's slugging a cop, it's... and they then restrict your free speech.
[01:44:49.962 --> 01:44:51.523]  You can't tell anybody about your arrest.
[01:44:51.543 --> 01:44:57.729]  They go in the libraries and the bookstores and they went and borders books and took all their records and told the people at their central headquarters.
[01:44:57.949 --> 01:44:58.790]  This was two years ago.
[01:44:59.090 --> 01:45:01.212]  You'll be arrested if you tell anyone we were here.
[01:45:01.973 --> 01:45:03.274]  And they gave them the subsection.
[01:45:03.334 --> 01:45:04.215]  It's in the Patriot Act.
[01:45:04.495 --> 01:45:08.359]  A subsection where you're not allowed to tell anyone that you were warrantlessly searched.
[01:45:12.797 --> 01:45:19.524]  But meanwhile, there's a bunch of lying criminal senators all over TV going, don't worry, it doesn't affect you, citizens.
[01:45:22.026 --> 01:45:27.111]  Just like Bush in the State of the Union saying, this is not an amnesty, it's a guest worker program.
[01:45:27.131 --> 01:45:27.932]  Well, here, let's see.
[01:45:28.533 --> 01:45:31.636]  For six years, anyone who's already here is instantly legalized.
[01:45:31.916 --> 01:45:34.439]  Anyone who can get here is instantly legalized.
[01:45:34.479 --> 01:45:35.460]  It's a six-year program.
[01:45:37.592 --> 01:45:44.055]  And it allows companies to have unlimited skilled and unlimited unskilled and to pay to bus and fly them here.
[01:45:47.497 --> 01:45:51.940]  And it gives them an ID card which is really the North American ID worker card.
[01:45:52.980 --> 01:45:53.901]  And we're getting them too.
[01:45:54.801 --> 01:45:56.442]  So it's the end of the country.
[01:45:56.922 --> 01:46:03.606]  The toll roads, the trans-Texas and trans-NAFTA highways, the trans-Florida highways, all of it.
[01:46:03.626 --> 01:46:04.206]  It's every state.
[01:46:04.964 --> 01:46:09.446]  All of this with the amnesty and the national ID card goes together.
[01:46:09.546 --> 01:46:11.107]  It all goes together.
[01:46:11.587 --> 01:46:13.688]  Take this New York fat tax.
[01:46:13.788 --> 01:46:14.949]  Let me get into that right now.
[01:46:14.969 --> 01:46:17.770]  We'll go to your calls after the break and we'll just take calls for the rest of the show.
[01:46:17.810 --> 01:46:25.974]  I know I haven't taken calls yet and I know we've got loaded phone lines and I know I've been blowing up all day because it's just at a certain point I'm having trouble taking it.
[01:46:27.475 --> 01:46:27.875]  Where is it?
[01:46:29.336 --> 01:46:30.276]  Where is it in my stack?
[01:46:31.337 --> 01:46:31.657]  Here it is.
[01:46:36.408 --> 01:46:37.268]  This is AP.
[01:46:38.049 --> 01:46:40.390]  New York Health Board proposes ban on trans fats.
[01:46:40.830 --> 01:46:41.390]  Here's another one.
[01:46:41.430 --> 01:46:42.911]  Chicago weighs new prohibition.
[01:46:43.311 --> 01:46:44.252]  Bad for you fats.
[01:46:45.292 --> 01:46:46.453]  CBS Health Watch.
[01:46:46.533 --> 01:46:47.954]  Feds want to regulate fat.
[01:46:50.014 --> 01:46:50.675]  Another AP.
[01:46:50.695 --> 01:46:52.976]  New York City moles ban on trans fats in eateries.
[01:46:54.156 --> 01:46:54.677]  Here's another one.
[01:46:54.737 --> 01:46:56.117]  Obesity surcharges.
[01:46:56.197 --> 01:46:57.818]  It's taxing to be overweight today.
[01:46:59.199 --> 01:46:59.459]  Okay.
[01:47:00.982 --> 01:47:04.505]  Now, I'm going to tell you what this is, and what's going to happen, and what's going to develop.
[01:47:04.565 --> 01:47:08.748]  And it's because I've read the European plans out of Germany and out of England.
[01:47:09.269 --> 01:47:15.494]  I've read the US plan out of the Treasury Department, out of the Department of Commerce, and out of the Department of Agriculture.
[01:47:15.754 --> 01:47:16.955]  Three different reports, okay?
[01:47:16.975 --> 01:47:18.657]  And I'm not even really doing research on this.
[01:47:18.677 --> 01:47:21.639]  This is just over the years, and I went this morning and printed up a bunch of these.
[01:47:23.981 --> 01:47:25.002]  Let me tell you what they're going to do.
[01:47:26.727 --> 01:47:31.069]  New York is where they always, New York, L.A., California, New York is where they always start this stuff.
[01:47:32.350 --> 01:47:37.192]  Just like they're keeping gun databases and letting the Feds use it in New York now.
[01:47:37.432 --> 01:47:40.873]  They're trying to get all the other state data just like Illinois is doing it.
[01:47:40.893 --> 01:47:41.934]  These are nexus points.
[01:47:42.074 --> 01:47:44.955]  It's like a spider web or a fulcrum.
[01:47:44.995 --> 01:47:46.936]  They hook into this and get leverage off of it.
[01:47:47.853 --> 01:48:01.303]  And then all the TVs and movies and news shows are produced in these cities, so then they act like facts will be banned nationwide, it'll be on all the TV and sitcoms, just like guns are banned nationwide on television, so then everybody thinks guns are really banned nationwide.
[01:48:01.543 --> 01:48:04.466]  Again, it's all perception, it's all perception management.
[01:48:06.487 --> 01:48:09.609]  There's a hundred other facets, but this is what they're going to do, okay?
[01:48:09.629 --> 01:48:10.090]  You wanna know?
[01:48:14.011 --> 01:48:25.221]  Before you get into the socialist mindset of, well, trans fats kill a lot of people with heart attacks, and it's bad for you, and then we've got to pay because of through health care for it, which kind of things are kind of socialized now, so maybe we should restrict it.
[01:48:25.641 --> 01:48:26.962]  Hey, cigarettes are bad.
[01:48:27.343 --> 01:48:28.063]  Liquor's bad.
[01:48:28.343 --> 01:48:29.585]  Trans fats are bad.
[01:48:30.345 --> 01:48:30.726]  Okay?
[01:48:30.986 --> 01:48:35.830]  Not wearing a helmet on your bicycle is pretty dangerous, but I don't do it because I don't like it.
[01:48:37.586 --> 01:48:39.706]  Riding a motorcycle is downright stupid!
[01:48:39.806 --> 01:48:40.427]  I don't do it!
[01:48:40.667 --> 01:48:42.847]  But if you want to, hey, go be my guest.
[01:48:43.287 --> 01:48:44.927]  Smash your brains out all over the cement.
[01:48:48.008 --> 01:48:50.028]  So let's get that part of the argument out of the way.
[01:48:50.068 --> 01:48:52.209]  The government isn't doing this because they care about you.
[01:48:52.549 --> 01:48:54.749]  They don't ban gambling because they don't want gambling.
[01:48:54.769 --> 01:48:58.030]  They ban gambling so they can come in and take it over and run it themselves.
[01:48:58.910 --> 01:49:01.551]  They don't have a war on drugs because they don't want drugs here.
[01:49:01.711 --> 01:49:03.791]  They have a war on drugs to go after their competition.
[01:49:04.582 --> 01:49:08.724]  And to jack up the price, because it'd be too low if they didn't have a war on drugs.
[01:49:08.884 --> 01:49:10.284]  It's about making it more profitable.
[01:49:11.545 --> 01:49:12.785]  It's so sick, isn't it?
[01:49:12.985 --> 01:49:14.326]  How pathetic we are!
[01:49:14.346 --> 01:49:15.686]  Oh, it's sick!
[01:49:17.007 --> 01:49:18.607]  May I search your car, please?
[01:49:18.667 --> 01:49:19.568]  I'm looking for drugs.
[01:49:19.888 --> 01:49:21.588]  No, you can't search my car!
[01:49:21.888 --> 01:49:23.989]  Your boss has shipped it in to begin with!
[01:49:24.029 --> 01:49:25.590]  I don't use your garbage!
[01:49:27.571 --> 01:49:27.971]  Idiot!
[01:49:28.811 --> 01:49:29.791]  That's what I want to tell him.
[01:49:31.652 --> 01:49:32.132]  Idiot!
[01:49:33.393 --> 01:49:33.753]  Anyways...
[01:49:34.963 --> 01:49:40.349]  When we get back, I'll briefly tell you what life's going to be like, just in this small area.
[01:49:40.729 --> 01:49:43.031]  How many years have I told you they're going to tax the fats?
[01:49:43.432 --> 01:49:44.613]  Oh, they're not going to ban them.
[01:49:44.653 --> 01:49:45.253]  Don't worry.
[01:49:46.355 --> 01:49:48.537]  Don't you worry for a single second.
[01:49:48.937 --> 01:49:49.598]  We'll be right back.
[01:49:57.097 --> 01:49:57.577]  It's here!
[01:49:57.797 --> 01:50:02.539]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:50:02.939 --> 01:50:10.601]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:50:11.282 --> 01:50:18.304]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:50:18.724 --> 01:50:25.586]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying,
[01:50:26.092 --> 01:50:30.174]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:50:30.454 --> 01:50:33.936]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:50:34.436 --> 01:50:36.357]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:50:36.678 --> 01:50:40.600]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:50:53.726 --> 01:50:56.747]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[01:50:57.068 --> 01:51:01.990]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[01:51:02.250 --> 01:51:06.612]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[01:51:06.892 --> 01:51:15.816]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[01:51:16.016 --> 01:51:19.638]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[01:51:19.918 --> 01:51:24.966]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[01:51:25.246 --> 01:51:31.997]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[01:51:32.478 --> 01:51:33.018]  What about you?

[01:53:02.029 --> 01:53:07.032]  Everett, Kathy, Rico, Chris, Dave, the lines have been loaded up all hour, I know.
[01:53:07.052 --> 01:53:12.935]  We'll take your calls coming up in the next hour, just continual calls.
[01:53:14.056 --> 01:53:17.538]  Again, I could talk for hours about just this fast food issue alone.
[01:53:19.159 --> 01:53:25.643]  Fast foods have new types of fats that have been created that your body isn't even designed to absorb.
[01:53:25.663 --> 01:53:27.564]  They're basically like plastics.
[01:53:28.317 --> 01:53:29.938]  And they do fill your arteries.
[01:53:30.178 --> 01:53:33.821]  And of course the media lied to you and told you it was normal fats that were bad.
[01:53:34.802 --> 01:53:42.127]  All the real scientific studies show that the true fats in moderate amounts are very good for you.
[01:53:42.919 --> 01:53:44.780]  Okay, real butter, things like that.
[01:53:45.140 --> 01:53:57.163]  Your brain is electrochemical, and 90 plus percent of your brain, of the solid matter, of course it's 70 percent water, but 90 percent of that 30 percent is cholesterol.
[01:53:57.223 --> 01:53:58.484]  Two different types of cholesterol.
[01:53:58.564 --> 01:54:02.305]  It's an electrochemical oil-based computer.
[01:54:02.365 --> 01:54:03.585]  It's a big blob of oil.
[01:54:05.066 --> 01:54:08.827]  And that's why they tell people who have seizures to eat high-fat foods.
[01:54:11.242 --> 01:54:16.584]  And a wide spectrum of facts is because you need that for brain operations.
[01:54:17.064 --> 01:54:21.465]  I'm just putting that out there, out front, that the U.S.
[01:54:21.485 --> 01:54:34.208]  Department of Agriculture, who's really heading all this up and advising the Department of Treasury, Department of Commerce, a bunch of other departments are involved, but I've read reports from those three over the last few years.
[01:54:36.122 --> 01:54:38.123]  Is they plan to tax it all?
[01:54:38.603 --> 01:54:53.449]  I mean, they're going to have a vice tax for your health, of course, that goes to health care, part of it, for alcohol, for beef, for chicken, for all forms of pork, poultry, everything.
[01:54:54.529 --> 01:55:00.291]  It isn't just going to be trans fats and these weird, you know, artificial fats they create.
[01:55:02.032 --> 01:55:05.213]  It's going to be everything, and guess how they're going to implement it?
[01:55:06.320 --> 01:55:10.544]  When you swipe your national ID card, you'll be arguing with idiots in five years, folks.
[01:55:10.604 --> 01:55:11.465]  It's already in place.
[01:55:11.786 --> 01:55:15.669]  And you'll be arguing with them, because it'll still have your state on the license.
[01:55:16.410 --> 01:55:17.371]  It's like your region.
[01:55:19.433 --> 01:55:21.635]  And they are going to then categorize.
[01:55:21.655 --> 01:55:25.019]  You're going to be able to get so much beer, and so much ice cream, and so much beef.
[01:55:26.073 --> 01:55:29.296]  But when you, and this is how it's going to start, at a certain point you won't be able to really get anything.
[01:55:29.697 --> 01:55:36.303]  It'll be flagged, and you are going to actually get, not CPS, but adult social workers.
[01:55:38.105 --> 01:55:39.867]  This is the new tyranny, boy, it's scary.
[01:55:40.467 --> 01:55:42.489]  Will come and say, were you having parties?
[01:55:42.569 --> 01:55:44.111]  Well, why are you eating all this?
[01:55:44.511 --> 01:55:47.434]  Because your record is going to show off what you swipe.
[01:55:48.218 --> 01:55:49.939]  And they're also going to do a quote for the sales tax.
[01:55:49.979 --> 01:55:52.960]  It's going to start for that first because it's going to be graduated.
[01:55:52.980 --> 01:55:55.741]  You make under $14,000 a year, no sales tax.
[01:55:57.141 --> 01:56:02.483]  And it's going to be apportioned to the state and the county and the city and the feds, so that brings more federal control in.
[01:56:02.503 --> 01:56:10.206]  You'll have to swipe that card or thumb scan at your computer when you make shopping cart purchases or when you're at Dillard's or Walmart.
[01:56:10.306 --> 01:56:11.066]  It doesn't matter.
[01:56:12.398 --> 01:56:14.159]  So they're going to sales tax you while you do it.
[01:56:14.579 --> 01:56:16.120]  This is the excuse for the databases.
[01:56:16.500 --> 01:56:18.560]  They're going to track what you eat and what you do.
[01:56:18.761 --> 01:56:23.983]  Insurance companies are already starting to get the data on what you're eating and using if that's come out.
[01:56:25.063 --> 01:56:26.384]  And it's going to be hell.
[01:56:26.644 --> 01:56:28.544]  I mean, it's going to be bad.
[01:56:29.525 --> 01:56:34.627]  And they are very close to passing the law in New York to ban all trans fats.
[01:56:34.667 --> 01:56:37.328]  And then they're going to have the new trans fats police.
[01:56:39.887 --> 01:56:47.330]  You know, instead of just not eating McDonald's, or instead of having a heart attack and suing McDonald's, which I really think people didn't know.
[01:56:47.390 --> 01:56:53.432]  So I think if you were on McDonald's before a year or two ago, and you ate it for ten years, you do have a heart attack, I don't think you can sue them.
[01:56:53.452 --> 01:56:55.112]  I think they are culpable, partially.
[01:56:56.953 --> 01:56:59.834]  But now people are enough educated that it's really their fault.
[01:56:59.854 --> 01:57:01.394]  I think there ought to be a cutoff date, too.
[01:57:02.215 --> 01:57:06.916]  But, you know, again, the government's got a million reasons to take our freedoms to keep us safe.
[01:57:07.336 --> 01:57:09.397]  None of it has anything to do with keeping you safe.
[01:57:12.250 --> 01:57:17.593]  It's all about getting control, micromanaging your life.
[01:57:17.673 --> 01:57:30.221]  I mean, we're going to be prisoners, folks, what we eat, what we do, and then we go to Europe, to Norway, where they're telling the boys that they have to sit when they use the bathroom.
[01:57:31.061 --> 01:57:32.622]  Because it upsets the girls if they don't.
[01:57:34.243 --> 01:57:38.486]  Order a copy of this show for your friends and family at GCNlive.com or call 877-300-7645.
[01:57:44.042 --> 01:57:44.342]  Hello!
[01:57:50.266 --> 01:57:50.947]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.567 --> 01:57:52.648]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:53.349 --> 01:57:54.489]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.509 --> 01:57:55.950]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.671 --> 01:57:57.592]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:58.232 --> 01:58:02.035]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.415 --> 01:58:06.498]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:14.111 --> 01:58:16.612]  All right, we're already into the third and final hour.
[01:58:16.673 --> 01:58:19.934]  There have been huge new developments concerning the North American Union.
[01:58:22.456 --> 01:58:25.197]  I've just got tons of vital news and information here in front of me.
[01:58:25.217 --> 01:58:26.518]  We're going to be covering it all this hour.
[01:58:26.558 --> 01:58:29.159]  But right now, we haven't opened the phones up yet.
[01:58:29.219 --> 01:58:31.180]  In this hour, I want to take at least 20 calls.
[01:58:31.280 --> 01:58:33.181]  We're going to move to you quickly so everybody gets a chance.
[01:58:33.782 --> 01:58:35.703]  Everett in New Jersey, you're on the air.
[01:58:35.763 --> 01:58:36.103]  Welcome.
[01:58:37.637 --> 01:58:39.939]  Or Yvette, I can't seem to read my own writing here.
[01:58:40.379 --> 01:58:41.400]  Yvette, go ahead.
[01:58:41.880 --> 01:58:42.481]  Oh, hello?
[01:58:42.501 --> 01:58:43.121]  Hi.
[01:58:43.402 --> 01:58:47.365]  Hi, I wanted to call you and say thank you for sounding the alarm.
[01:58:47.485 --> 01:58:50.627]  I saw 9-1-1, Road to Tyranny, and Terror Storm.
[01:58:50.667 --> 01:58:52.228]  They were total eye-openers.
[01:58:52.288 --> 01:58:55.531]  They scared me wide awake, and I want to wake others up now.
[01:58:56.104 --> 01:59:00.667]  Unfortunately, the problem I'm facing is that most people seem to be incredulous and apathetic.
[01:59:00.707 --> 01:59:01.808]  They don't know, they don't care.
[01:59:01.848 --> 01:59:12.416]  Remember, in a fight, when you go to a football game, there are, what, 21 people on the field, or 22 people, whatever, 11 and 11, and
[01:59:15.478 --> 01:59:18.820]  Public school education folks, I can't do basic arithmetic here.
[01:59:19.361 --> 01:59:23.464]  So you've got limited people on the field, and you've got thousands in the bleachers.
[01:59:23.524 --> 01:59:28.428]  So if they want to just sit around and go, I think the government should take all my freedom.
[01:59:28.848 --> 01:59:29.309]  Fine!
[01:59:29.369 --> 01:59:30.810]  They've never mattered in history.
[01:59:31.070 --> 01:59:32.892]  It's those of us that are going to take action.
[01:59:33.232 --> 01:59:34.653]  Find the people that do care.
[01:59:34.753 --> 01:59:36.234]  Find the people that do want to get involved.
[01:59:36.475 --> 01:59:38.156]  Don't worry about people that love Hitler.
[01:59:38.906 --> 01:59:39.346]  Yeah.
[01:59:39.767 --> 01:59:43.809]  But the thing is, I don't know anyone who's really passionate about this.
[01:59:43.829 --> 01:59:45.850]  Like, I keep hearing about the truth movement.
[01:59:45.870 --> 01:59:47.611]  I'm like, where is the truth movement?
[01:59:47.631 --> 01:59:51.913]  Well, I have to tell you that New Jersey is somewhat of a black hole for freedom.
[01:59:52.533 --> 01:59:53.874]  We do have a lot of listeners there.
[01:59:53.894 --> 01:59:55.955]  We get emails from there, but they all tell us it's bad.
[01:59:56.784 --> 02:00:01.911]  And I met a great guy when I was up in New York named John who was from New Jersey.
[02:00:02.452 --> 02:00:03.373]  Worked there at the airport.
[02:00:03.393 --> 02:00:03.974]  Nice fella.
[02:00:04.374 --> 02:00:04.935]  Fan of the show.
[02:00:04.975 --> 02:00:06.096]  He came out to Ground Zero.
[02:00:06.437 --> 02:00:07.698]  There are good people there.
[02:00:08.199 --> 02:00:09.461]  I wouldn't call it a hotbed.
[02:00:10.302 --> 02:00:13.486]  But you can probably find local patriot groups online.
[02:00:14.046 --> 02:00:16.389]  In New Jersey, you're going to have to look.
[02:00:17.250 --> 02:00:22.937]  Maybe people in your workplace don't care, your family doesn't care, but there are people there who love liberty and freedom.
[02:00:22.977 --> 02:00:29.544]  I mean, we've got national polls, 68% believing there's a cover-up, 42% believing the government carried out 9-11.
[02:00:30.626 --> 02:00:32.067]  Okay, well I'm going to try to find them.
[02:00:32.107 --> 02:00:34.388]  And also, I wanted to ask you a couple of questions.
[02:00:34.408 --> 02:00:34.929]  Sure, go ahead.
[02:00:35.369 --> 02:00:38.871]  I heard somewhere that Homeland Security was planned before 9-11.
[02:00:38.991 --> 02:00:40.152]  Is that true?
[02:00:40.232 --> 02:00:40.512]  Yes.
[02:00:40.592 --> 02:00:43.594]  Bill Clinton gave a speech in 1993 about Homeland Security.
[02:00:44.194 --> 02:00:48.176]  And FEMA had it on the drawing boards publicly for two years before 9-11.
[02:00:48.196 --> 02:00:49.057]  And, uh, yes.
[02:00:51.258 --> 02:00:52.379]  Where can I find that?
[02:00:52.399 --> 02:00:58.644]  Because I'm thinking if I could find the evidence, like some documented evidence and hand out to people, they'll believe me.
[02:00:58.684 --> 02:01:01.607]  Well, I've come across it before and seen it, but it was a few years ago.
[02:01:01.667 --> 02:01:03.168]  I can't place exactly where.
[02:01:03.248 --> 02:01:04.029]  My memory fails.
[02:01:04.469 --> 02:01:07.952]  Okay, and the other question I have is the North American Union.
[02:01:07.992 --> 02:01:11.755]  Is that supposed to start before or on 2010?
[02:01:11.956 --> 02:01:12.516]  I keep hearing 2010.
[02:01:13.077 --> 02:01:16.019]  Okay, there's a lot of confusion because the government's been very secretive.
[02:01:16.059 --> 02:01:19.342]  They say it will officially be in full swing
[02:01:20.425 --> 02:01:20.585]  By 2008.
[02:01:22.167 --> 02:01:27.191]  They said it would officially be in swing by 2005 on C-SPAN with David Rockefeller.
[02:01:27.211 --> 02:01:27.891]  Oh wow!
[02:01:27.911 --> 02:01:29.953]  Yeah, they said that in 2000.
[02:01:30.313 --> 02:01:36.138]  They said it would be in full power by 2005, but they're behind schedule.
[02:01:36.519 --> 02:01:39.121]  But they officially signed the total agreement
[02:01:39.844 --> 02:01:53.652]  Last March it was another agreement in December and now we're fully going under it but they have like ten different programs running side-by-side that all combine together to form it and they're all declaring national security and saying it's secret.
[02:01:53.672 --> 02:01:59.575]  They had a meeting two weeks ago in Canada with all these world leaders and they kept it, North American leaders, they kept it secret.
[02:02:00.135 --> 02:02:04.297]  So they are merging the police, merging the military, merging social security.
[02:02:04.658 --> 02:02:07.059]  Again, this is the power of this shadow government.
[02:02:08.043 --> 02:02:11.425]  Okay, they're actually... So, we're in the North American Union right now.
[02:02:11.766 --> 02:02:12.526]  Oh, wow.
[02:02:12.566 --> 02:02:16.008]  I mean, it's kind of like... You've been kidnapped.
[02:02:18.510 --> 02:02:22.292]  Ted Bundy is driving you to the farmhouse where he's going to rape you and kill you.
[02:02:22.832 --> 02:02:26.555]  You're in the back of the Volkswagen right now with a gag in your mouth tied up.
[02:02:27.255 --> 02:02:29.056]  Okay, so you're in his hands.
[02:02:29.777 --> 02:02:34.880]  And then he's going to start biting chunks out of you very soon.
[02:02:35.692 --> 02:02:40.314]  So we're in the North American Union, it's just that they haven't started the full savagery yet.
[02:02:40.754 --> 02:02:42.375]  The fun is about to start.
[02:02:42.875 --> 02:02:45.416]  Thank you for the call.
[02:02:49.017 --> 02:02:52.219]  It's here, after a year in production, traveling to distant lands.
[02:02:52.559 --> 02:02:54.500]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[02:02:54.860 --> 02:03:02.423]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:03:03.206 --> 02:03:10.249]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:03:10.649 --> 02:03:22.094]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police forgery, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:03:22.374 --> 02:03:25.896]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:03:26.336 --> 02:03:28.277]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:03:28.617 --> 02:03:32.439]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:05:37.426 --> 02:05:39.909]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:55.007 --> 02:06:07.979]  That really is the best analogy I've got for the North American Union, the New Freedom Initiative, the Real ID Act, the Amnesty Plan, the toll roads, all of it, is they've gotten it all in place.
[02:06:08.179 --> 02:06:12.784]  It's like Ted Bundy's tricked the girl to get into his Volkswagen at the shopping mall.
[02:06:12.804 --> 02:06:14.125]  Hey, go for a ride with me, honey.
[02:06:14.145 --> 02:06:18.489]  And he puts a gun to her head, he gags her, he ties her up, he puts her in the back seat,
[02:06:19.269 --> 02:06:20.409]  He's in a little Volkswagen.
[02:06:20.429 --> 02:06:21.270]  Trucks are driving by.
[02:06:21.290 --> 02:06:23.050]  They could look down through the window and see her there.
[02:06:23.090 --> 02:06:24.071]  He's in a lot of danger.
[02:06:24.131 --> 02:06:24.771]  He's bold.
[02:06:25.071 --> 02:06:26.471]  He's driving her to the farmhouse.
[02:06:26.832 --> 02:06:28.612]  He's going to torture her for 24 hours.
[02:06:29.192 --> 02:06:29.593]  Rape her.
[02:06:29.693 --> 02:06:31.273]  Bite big chunks out of her body.
[02:06:31.693 --> 02:06:32.734]  And then he's going to kill her.
[02:06:32.774 --> 02:06:33.794]  He's going to slit her throat.
[02:06:34.374 --> 02:06:36.115]  He's going to bury her in a shallow grave.
[02:06:36.735 --> 02:06:38.976]  Well, America is on the highway.
[02:06:39.076 --> 02:06:40.256]  He's driven out of the mall.
[02:06:40.316 --> 02:06:41.437]  He's driven down the side streets.
[02:06:41.737 --> 02:06:43.017]  He's gotten on the highway.
[02:06:43.297 --> 02:06:44.037]  He's driving.
[02:06:44.098 --> 02:06:45.338]  It's 10 miles to the
[02:06:47.015 --> 02:06:49.317]  In fact, he should have got caught in the mall.
[02:06:49.377 --> 02:06:50.058]  He wasn't caught.
[02:06:50.078 --> 02:06:51.539]  He should have got caught in the side streets.
[02:06:51.999 --> 02:06:52.940]  That was a better chance.
[02:06:52.980 --> 02:06:54.041]  Now we're in more danger.
[02:06:54.101 --> 02:06:56.282]  Now we're going down the coastal highway.
[02:06:56.803 --> 02:06:57.984]  He's salivating.
[02:06:59.525 --> 02:07:01.466]  And we're in the North American Union.
[02:07:01.567 --> 02:07:02.787]  Okay, we're in it now.
[02:07:03.128 --> 02:07:04.569]  We're in the New World Order.
[02:07:04.589 --> 02:07:08.692]  Okay, they're on the verge of passing legislation to secretly arrest citizens and torture them.
[02:07:09.453 --> 02:07:10.674]  And use it as evidence.
[02:07:11.855 --> 02:07:13.516]  I mean, we're here.
[02:07:13.616 --> 02:07:14.897]  We're in their custody.
[02:07:16.364 --> 02:07:22.027]  But, we've got a chance to just flail and kick and kick out the side door.
[02:07:22.307 --> 02:07:24.728]  We should have flailed and kicked when he first pulled the gun on us.
[02:07:25.488 --> 02:07:29.730]  Once we got in the car, we should have just let him shoot us and jump out onto the side of the street and run screaming.
[02:07:31.351 --> 02:07:41.216]  We should have, once he got us tied up, we should have kicked and screamed and chewed through and kicked at the side of the Volkswagen and kicked at the glass windows and not care if they shoot us.
[02:07:42.677 --> 02:07:43.318]  But no!
[02:07:43.438 --> 02:07:44.820]  Now we're out on the dark highway.
[02:07:44.840 --> 02:07:46.062]  There's a few cars by us.
[02:07:46.102 --> 02:07:46.803]  What are we going to do?
[02:07:46.843 --> 02:07:47.484]  What are we going to do?
[02:07:47.504 --> 02:07:50.949]  Oh my gosh.
[02:07:51.209 --> 02:07:52.651]  We're in so much trouble, folks.
[02:07:52.751 --> 02:07:54.294]  I mean, these people are so evil.
[02:07:55.186 --> 02:08:12.982]  Our whole country has been seized by psychopathic killers, in fancy suits with fancy PR firms, fooling the mindless, gibbering, giggling population who has no idea the dollar's been debased, who has no idea the economy's gone, who has no idea what we're facing.
[02:08:13.002 --> 02:08:17.726]  Uh-huh, man, it's bad.
[02:08:18.407 --> 02:08:19.368]  Let's go to, um,
[02:08:20.091 --> 02:08:22.392]  Kathy in British Columbia, thanks for holding.
[02:08:22.572 --> 02:08:23.212]  You're on the air.
[02:08:23.232 --> 02:08:25.554]  Hi Alex, a couple of things.
[02:08:25.754 --> 02:08:32.937]  I just wanted to mention that the Chinese population in Vancouver have been protesting against the human
[02:08:33.413 --> 02:08:38.236]  Race violation of the Chinese in front of their embassy?
[02:08:38.276 --> 02:08:42.899]  Yeah, the Falun Gong and the Epoch Times, and they should be getting more attention in all of our press than it has.
[02:08:43.340 --> 02:08:49.344]  Well, you know, the council wants to stop them from doing that because it's a demerit to the government.
[02:08:49.724 --> 02:08:50.544]  See, I knew it!
[02:08:50.645 --> 02:08:51.025]  I knew it!
[02:08:51.045 --> 02:08:54.427]  See, in Canada, in fact, I'd rather they want to stop them from protesting.
[02:08:54.447 --> 02:08:55.828]  You see, there's your freedom, folks!
[02:08:55.988 --> 02:08:59.791]  They don't want them with signs out there of people beaten to death and the dead babies.
[02:09:00.111 --> 02:09:01.252]  Okay, that's your freedom!
[02:09:01.292 --> 02:09:02.492]  That's your freedom in Canada!
[02:09:02.512 --> 02:09:03.193]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:09:04.253 --> 02:09:09.995]  Well, and they're basing this on, it's a by-law violation, because as you know, by-laws are more important than human rights.
[02:09:10.015 --> 02:09:11.575]  Right?
[02:09:11.955 --> 02:09:14.736]  Well, what are they saying is a by-law violation?
[02:09:14.816 --> 02:09:17.377]  Oh, something about congregating on the streets.
[02:09:18.617 --> 02:09:25.238]  Yeah, well, I'm sure they'll have some back alley where no one can see them where they'll be authorized for their free speech zone.
[02:09:27.039 --> 02:09:27.139]  Yep.
[02:09:27.179 --> 02:09:28.039]  See how they do that?
[02:09:28.559 --> 02:09:29.620]  Where is this in Canada?
[02:09:30.260 --> 02:09:31.000]  Vancouver, BC.
[02:09:32.037 --> 02:09:35.118]  I remember seeing a report in the Epoch Times, but I'm trying to restrict it.
[02:09:35.618 --> 02:09:41.881]  Yeah, how dare these little quiet Asian women sit there with pictures of Falun Gong being tortured to death.
[02:09:42.221 --> 02:09:44.322]  How dare them!
[02:09:44.342 --> 02:09:46.823]  We've got to shut them down because we're free!
[02:09:46.903 --> 02:09:48.323]  Let me tell you about Canada.
[02:09:49.684 --> 02:09:56.426]  We even went to UPS because literally more than half the packages would not get into Canada.
[02:09:56.446 --> 02:10:00.268]  They'd smash them, they'd break them, they'd send back letters saying it was terrorist documents.
[02:10:00.648 --> 02:10:01.248]  Literally, I have
[02:10:02.282 --> 02:10:03.242]  Boxes of this stuff.
[02:10:03.803 --> 02:10:04.923]  We went to UPS.
[02:10:05.023 --> 02:10:06.463]  UPS has never had problems.
[02:10:06.483 --> 02:10:08.384]  They're totally shocked.
[02:10:08.604 --> 02:10:10.265]  99% of it's making it through, on average.
[02:10:10.305 --> 02:10:11.965]  I mean, it's only one or two packages a week.
[02:10:12.545 --> 02:10:15.006]  Of the 100 or so we send up to Canada, it's quite a few.
[02:10:15.046 --> 02:10:17.207]  Canada's a huge part of our business.
[02:10:17.307 --> 02:10:18.807]  I mean, it's probably not 100 a week, actually.
[02:10:18.827 --> 02:10:20.688]  But it's a whole bunch of packages is the point.
[02:10:21.489 --> 02:10:24.831]  And what they're doing is, is they know who I am!
[02:10:25.491 --> 02:10:35.655]  And they white glove us, man, with all these forms perfectly filled out, all this, I mean, Canadians need to know, folks, you are in a cesspit of tyranny.
[02:10:36.115 --> 02:10:38.476]  The Canadians go, I wouldn't know that, really?
[02:10:38.796 --> 02:10:41.077]  You're nice people, but very naive.
[02:10:41.758 --> 02:10:49.021]  Well, we're not getting the information here, and the other thing that's just been driving me crazy is hearing about
[02:10:50.188 --> 02:10:51.529]  The border, the Mexican border.
[02:10:51.929 --> 02:10:54.130]  Up here we're told we're going to have to have a passport.
[02:10:54.450 --> 02:11:00.613]  We've been told that if the Americans come up here and they don't have a passport, they're not going to be allowed back into their own country.
[02:11:00.953 --> 02:11:01.574]  No, no, no, no.
[02:11:01.734 --> 02:11:02.374]  That's true.
[02:11:02.654 --> 02:11:08.657]  And again, the illegal aliens and all the foreigners coming to the southern, they don't have to have anything to get bank accounts, nothing.
[02:11:08.677 --> 02:11:12.379]  But yes, Americans are going to have to have all this ID and so are Canadians.
[02:11:12.419 --> 02:11:15.241]  Because we're the fat, dumb slaves, see?
[02:11:15.461 --> 02:11:17.102]  We're the ones that do whatever we're told.
[02:11:18.647 --> 02:11:24.570]  And the Mexicans can go through freely, but nobody, I shouldn't say nobody, but very few people are aware of it.
[02:11:24.790 --> 02:11:30.613]  And it's so hard to get that information out and to be believed because they believe the talking heads is so funny.
[02:11:30.633 --> 02:11:33.615]  I mean, I've had reporters call me and they go, they really cussed at you?
[02:11:33.635 --> 02:11:35.075]  They really threatened you at Customs?
[02:11:35.135 --> 02:11:35.836]  I'm like, yeah.
[02:11:36.556 --> 02:11:41.759]  And then a bunch of reporters came down there and wrote good articles about me because Customs was so rude to them.
[02:11:42.558 --> 02:11:48.920]  Imagine TV, radio, microphones, print media's there and they got screamed at by customs at the airport.
[02:11:49.821 --> 02:11:53.022]  Well you should try customs at our border now, they walked off the job.
[02:11:53.582 --> 02:11:55.983]  So don't go through there now because they're angry with everybody.
[02:11:58.164 --> 02:12:03.586]  It's just, I know, a bunch of, we're going to be ruled by a bunch of spoiled rotten government pimps.
[02:12:03.686 --> 02:12:04.546]  I appreciate your call.
[02:12:04.886 --> 02:12:06.487]  Good to hear from you from British Columbia.
[02:12:06.527 --> 02:12:08.008]  And if I'm angry, you know, it's good.
[02:12:08.088 --> 02:12:08.828]  We should all be mad.
[02:12:10.006 --> 02:12:10.526]  Think about it.
[02:12:10.586 --> 02:12:13.688]  Statistically, government is made up of the general public.
[02:12:14.648 --> 02:12:18.730]  And statistically, bad people get into government and they're allowed to get away with more.
[02:12:19.431 --> 02:12:22.432]  That's why statistically, and you can say, well you can do whatever you want with statistics.
[02:12:22.472 --> 02:12:23.553]  These are hard numbers.
[02:12:24.753 --> 02:12:32.137]  Much higher level of murder, drug abuse, child molestation, child abuse by government.
[02:12:32.357 --> 02:12:34.698]  I don't care if it's school teacher, cop,
[02:12:35.647 --> 02:12:37.047]  A truancy officer?
[02:12:37.067 --> 02:12:39.428]  Then the numbers are off the charts.
[02:12:39.908 --> 02:12:40.948]  Social workers?
[02:12:42.669 --> 02:12:45.449]  Where do you think molesters go to get jobs?
[02:12:46.249 --> 02:12:47.149]  They go to be cops.
[02:12:47.850 --> 02:12:50.430]  They go to be school teachers.
[02:12:50.450 --> 02:12:52.330]  They go to be CPS workers.
[02:12:53.051 --> 02:12:54.771]  And those numbers are all official.
[02:12:54.791 --> 02:12:57.291]  You can go look at them, but it's kept real quiet.
[02:12:57.472 --> 02:12:59.712]  So see, my point is, the government
[02:13:00.607 --> 02:13:05.449]  Isn't qualified to wipe their own snot-filled nose!
[02:13:07.030 --> 02:13:09.811]  You people couldn't get jobs elsewhere!
[02:13:10.091 --> 02:13:13.473]  You people went to get jobs there so you could control freak!
[02:13:13.753 --> 02:13:15.493]  You went there because you wanted power!
[02:13:15.734 --> 02:13:16.814]  I'm not saying all of you.
[02:13:16.974 --> 02:13:18.335]  I'm not even saying most of you.
[02:13:18.535 --> 02:13:21.416]  I'm saying a big, fat minority of you.
[02:13:23.940 --> 02:13:25.320]  Okay, and in the past, the U.S.
[02:13:25.340 --> 02:13:28.041]  government, 50, 60, 70 years ago, didn't put up with any malfeasance.
[02:13:28.261 --> 02:13:31.182]  There was some of it, but not as much, because it was embarrassing to everyone else.
[02:13:31.442 --> 02:13:36.363]  There was a saying, you know, you bring discredit to the service, you're fired!
[02:13:36.843 --> 02:13:39.524]  Now, they do wrong, it's, oh, you're promoted.
[02:13:40.384 --> 02:13:44.846]  The top three people over CPS in Florida, all convicted child rapists.
[02:13:45.206 --> 02:13:47.246]  They wondered why 3,000 children were missing.
[02:13:47.446 --> 02:13:48.907]  See, see, and that sounds crazy.
[02:13:49.067 --> 02:13:50.187]  That sounds like that's not true.
[02:13:50.874 --> 02:13:53.215]  That 3,000 plus children were missing.
[02:13:53.436 --> 02:13:56.557]  And by the way, they're still missing, and it's just gone out of the news headlines.
[02:13:57.158 --> 02:14:00.940]  They found some dead, heads chopped off, buried, found them in different countries.
[02:14:03.942 --> 02:14:09.425]  And a subsequent investigation found it was a child molester guild running the Florida CPS, and they still run it.
[02:14:12.935 --> 02:14:15.457]  These people are unbelievable.
[02:14:15.597 --> 02:14:16.838]  And then they write the laws.
[02:14:16.898 --> 02:14:17.618]  It's really sick.
[02:14:18.019 --> 02:14:20.861]  Like the government ships in the drugs, then busts you when you use them.
[02:14:21.701 --> 02:14:23.943]  Or your neighbor, or your child, or your father, your mother.
[02:14:26.044 --> 02:14:26.665]  It's the same thing.
[02:14:26.705 --> 02:14:32.169]  Now they're getting laws passed where you have to register for life, where you can't live in certain areas if you're a quote sex offender.
[02:14:32.409 --> 02:14:35.051]  But then you go look at it, the majority of the sex offenders now
[02:14:36.623 --> 02:14:50.736]  Are things like 18 year old with 16 year old or 18 year old with 17 year old or somebody starts dating a girl when she's 14 he's 15 and then when he gets to be 18 they come and swoop and arrest him on the day of his birthday.
[02:14:50.776 --> 02:14:51.597]  I see those cases.
[02:14:55.768 --> 02:14:57.790]  You see, this is how they operate, folks.
[02:14:58.390 --> 02:15:19.445]  We have all these different groups of criminals and sickos and control freaks who got smart, and they took over the government, and it's called tyranny, and it's the norm in history to have a bunch of degenerate criminals in fancy, that's why they always wear big fancy hats and medals and capes and, you know, had laws at the low level, couldn't wear the fanciness.
[02:15:19.465 --> 02:15:21.567]  It was all the, look, I'm wearing the fanciness!
[02:15:21.807 --> 02:15:22.728]  Bow down before me!
[02:15:22.968 --> 02:15:24.189]  I must be legitimate!
[02:15:24.998 --> 02:15:26.959]  Because I'm wearing all the fanciness!
[02:15:28.419 --> 02:15:38.903]  The fancy hats, the fancy badges, the fancy baubles, the fancy riding crops, and the signets, and the scepters, and the... and the orbs!
[02:15:39.143 --> 02:15:41.324]  Oh, look at you!
[02:15:41.724 --> 02:15:43.004]  That's what bullying is!
[02:15:43.084 --> 02:15:50.667]  It's all this government bullying, and how they're officials, and how they're authorities, and how we have to do what they say!
[02:15:53.081 --> 02:15:55.302]  And statistically, they're a bunch of scum.
[02:15:56.103 --> 02:15:58.184]  Let's go ahead and talk to Rico in Toronto.
[02:15:58.224 --> 02:15:58.765]  You're on the air.
[02:15:58.825 --> 02:15:59.545]  Go ahead, Rico.
[02:15:59.565 --> 02:16:00.406]  Hi, Alex.
[02:16:00.906 --> 02:16:01.426]  Good to talk to you.
[02:16:01.446 --> 02:16:01.947]  What's on your mind?
[02:16:02.527 --> 02:16:03.427]  Two things.
[02:16:04.308 --> 02:16:11.452]  One, last week, I remember Charles Rangel was on, and I thought he was a slick, greasy pimp.
[02:16:12.013 --> 02:16:13.574]  That was the first thing I wanted to see.
[02:16:13.594 --> 02:16:15.595]  Yeah, he is a slick, greasy pimp.
[02:16:16.075 --> 02:16:16.516]  Yeah.
[02:16:17.671 --> 02:16:31.222]  Do you remember about three weeks ago you were talking about how the Parliament building at Ottawa was, was, there was a lot of esoteric, um... Yeah, official newspapers admit it's a giant black magic temple.
[02:16:31.703 --> 02:16:33.104]  Okay, listen to this.
[02:16:33.805 --> 02:16:45.915]  About ten years ago, and I remember it, because I was watching it on TV, um, a guy took his car, this is 97-98, took his car,
[02:16:46.954 --> 02:16:52.716]  He drove it right in front of, inside the main door.
[02:16:52.976 --> 02:16:57.157]  He drove it up the stairs and smashed through the door.
[02:16:57.177 --> 02:17:00.198]  So, obviously the cops came, you know, they got him.
[02:17:00.678 --> 02:17:06.580]  And then they said, before the newspaper could, the news cameras could kind of put a lid on it, he's in the back of the car.
[02:17:07.041 --> 02:17:09.201]  And they asked him, they go, why did you do this?
[02:17:10.042 --> 02:17:11.182]  And then he goes,
[02:17:11.991 --> 02:17:14.152]  There's a lot of Satan worshipping going on in there.
[02:17:14.452 --> 02:17:19.295]  And he goes, I have the names of the people who do it in my pocket.
[02:17:20.516 --> 02:17:23.878]  And we never heard from this guy again.
[02:17:24.078 --> 02:17:24.778]  Never saw him.
[02:17:24.818 --> 02:17:26.199]  Just kind of disappeared.
[02:17:26.219 --> 02:17:26.959]  Yeah, stay there.
[02:17:26.979 --> 02:17:28.180]  We'll talk about it when we get back.
[02:17:28.200 --> 02:17:29.020]  Stay there Rico.
[02:17:29.481 --> 02:17:30.661]  And Chris, Dave, and many others.
[02:17:30.681 --> 02:17:30.741]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:17:34.873 --> 02:17:36.096]  We'll continue with your calls.
[02:17:36.136 --> 02:17:37.519]  Also get into the North American Union.
[02:17:37.559 --> 02:17:38.541]  Big new developments there.
[02:17:38.942 --> 02:17:39.403]  Stay with us.
[02:17:39.423 --> 02:17:43.492]  The websites are Infowars.com, Infowars.net, and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:17:47.446 --> 02:17:52.090]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[02:17:52.430 --> 02:17:56.654]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[02:17:56.954 --> 02:17:57.515]  We listened.
[02:17:57.835 --> 02:18:02.959]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[02:18:03.259 --> 02:18:03.760]  We listened.
[02:18:04.160 --> 02:18:07.283]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[02:18:07.703 --> 02:18:08.264]  We listened.
[02:18:08.744 --> 02:18:12.227]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power
[02:18:12.247 --> 02:18:12.808]  We're good to go.
[02:18:29.788 --> 02:18:32.489]  Get the Berkey Light, the American water purifier.
[02:18:32.689 --> 02:18:32.909]  Only $279.
[02:18:33.369 --> 02:18:37.530]  Call New Millennium 888-803-4438.
[02:18:37.630 --> 02:18:40.051]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:18:40.471 --> 02:18:43.832]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[02:18:43.992 --> 02:18:45.313]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:18:51.355 --> 02:18:53.455]  Currency devaluation, inflation.
[02:18:53.935 --> 02:18:54.616]  One and the same.
[02:18:55.356 --> 02:18:56.676]  If you have deposited $100,000 in a bank at 1%,
[02:18:59.716 --> 02:19:05.198]  In a 30-month period dating from May 24, 2005, here is what happened to your funds.
[02:19:05.599 --> 02:19:08.720]  The dollar lost 33% of its value in that time frame.
[02:19:09.000 --> 02:19:10.821]  The bank paid you 1%.
[02:19:10.881 --> 02:19:13.902]  Your $100,000 now has a net purchasing power of $68,000.
[02:19:14.443 --> 02:19:16.684]  Here is reality.
[02:19:17.044 --> 02:19:20.605]  The devaluation of currency equals real inflation.
[02:19:21.105 --> 02:19:24.767]  Keep in mind how the value of your paper assets are measured in dollars.
[02:19:25.327 --> 02:19:27.908]  Gold, in the same time frame, increased 35% in value.

[02:19:39.450 --> 02:19:49.072]  David J. Smith for NewsWatch Magazine.
[02:19:49.472 --> 02:19:56.173]  Did you know that an FBI agent assigned to the White House when Bill Clinton took office wrote a book entitled Unlimited Access?
[02:19:56.972 --> 02:20:03.917]  He told of Clinton's staff coming into the White House its first day with red buttons on their shirt with a picture of the first communist dictator, B.I.
[02:20:04.397 --> 02:20:05.057]  Lennon, on them.
[02:20:05.918 --> 02:20:10.621]  Is it any wonder the United States government moved further to the left during the Clinton administration?
[02:20:11.202 --> 02:20:15.204]  Even Hillary tried to pass a socialistic program for health care.

[02:21:53.248 --> 02:21:57.551]  Yeah, when we get into this subject, some people go, what?
[02:21:58.072 --> 02:22:19.388]  It has been in the Toronto Star and one of their big paper, one of their professors up there, we had him on about a year ago, went back and did the research and said, yeah, when they built this thing, turn of the last century, it was like 1904 or something, and I've been there, I've seen the very people he mentioned there as the founders, was built as neo-gothic
[02:22:20.445 --> 02:22:23.687]  And the main room is where they, quote, could do rituals.
[02:22:23.747 --> 02:22:25.067]  It's calculated out to measure 666.
[02:22:27.428 --> 02:22:29.189]  The sun shoots through the window.
[02:22:30.309 --> 02:22:32.991]  And there's demons and devils all over.
[02:22:33.031 --> 02:22:38.853]  The thing is, it's really, it's got green roof, devils all over it.
[02:22:40.254 --> 02:22:43.095]  When I make this Bilderberg group film, we're going to have some shots of it.
[02:22:43.115 --> 02:22:46.457]  We're not going to get off into the occult aspects, but you'll be able to see some of it.
[02:22:46.497 --> 02:22:46.797]  It's weird.
[02:22:49.020 --> 02:22:58.933]  And yeah, he then went and researched this professor and found out that a secret group of high-level masons actually financed the blueprint or the architecture of the building and that they do do rituals there.
[02:22:59.934 --> 02:23:06.643]  But I didn't know about you seeing it on the news where the guy goes crashing a car into it, and you said this was in the late 90s?
[02:23:09.602 --> 02:23:30.489]  Ninety-seven, ninety-eight, it was the summer, and I was just watching TV, and before they had a time to really put a cap on it, a lid on it, he was just at the back of the squad car, and I guess Ottawa has 24-hour stand-by news guys, because they just came to the car, and they had a camera, and they go, why did you do this?
[02:23:30.909 --> 02:23:31.529]  And then he goes,
[02:23:32.150 --> 02:23:34.692]  There's a lot of Satan worshipping going on in there.
[02:23:34.732 --> 02:23:39.516]  Well, yeah, the CBC actually has an office 24 hours a day broadcasting out of the Parliament building.
[02:23:39.877 --> 02:23:43.500]  Well, there you go, because they were really able to just... Nah, I've been there, yeah.
[02:23:43.800 --> 02:23:44.661]  Yeah, real quickly.
[02:23:44.941 --> 02:23:52.768]  And then they go, well, there's a lot of Satan worshipping going on in there, and I have the names of everybody that does it in my pocket.
[02:23:53.388 --> 02:23:58.773]  And the next day, it was kind of like, you just watched, you never heard about that guy again.
[02:23:59.534 --> 02:24:00.916]  You know, it was just, that's it.
[02:24:01.216 --> 02:24:04.320]  It'd be interesting to find out his name and then see if he's out of prison yet.
[02:24:06.013 --> 02:24:15.497]  It would be interesting, and I don't know if he... I'm sure you know, Canada has all these weird, like, the Secret Act, which is from the British heritage.
[02:24:15.837 --> 02:24:16.818]  Oh yeah, it's really bad.
[02:24:16.838 --> 02:24:19.539]  And again, Canadians think they're free, they're not.
[02:24:20.159 --> 02:24:27.603]  There's this nice, smiling little velvet glove over the iron fist, the iron spiked fist, dripping with blood, I would add.
[02:24:28.423 --> 02:24:31.184]  But have you ever been to the Ottawa capital?
[02:24:31.204 --> 02:24:32.585]  Have you ever seen that building?
[02:24:34.004 --> 02:24:38.848]  I've seen it only from TV.
[02:24:39.028 --> 02:24:43.711]  Oh man, there's like demons and devils all over it.
[02:24:44.761 --> 02:24:51.303]  It is the most evil, it's like something out of a horror movie, where like the evil witch lives, or the evil king, you know like Mordor or something.
[02:24:51.343 --> 02:24:52.023]  Thanks for the call.
[02:24:52.543 --> 02:25:00.866]  In fact folks, the building, when you get up close to it, looks like something out of Lord of the Rings, where like Sauron lives or something.
[02:25:01.626 --> 02:25:03.587]  Let's go ahead and talk to Chris.
[02:25:05.167 --> 02:25:06.547]  Chris, where are you calling us from today?
[02:25:07.208 --> 02:25:08.128]  Lincoln, Nebraska.
[02:25:08.368 --> 02:25:08.748]  Welcome.
[02:25:09.708 --> 02:25:11.169]  Yeah, say Alex,
[02:25:12.361 --> 02:25:25.867]  Talking about, you know, the loss of our rights, I was reading one of the most famous speeches in history in defense of democracy, and it was a speech made by Pericles to the Athenians back in 431 BC.
[02:25:26.527 --> 02:25:33.750]  And it's a great tribute to the work that you're doing, and especially to what Lawrence Jones has done in the last couple of days.
[02:25:34.191 --> 02:25:41.874]  And it takes about one minute of air time to read this very famous speech, and I wonder if it would fit into your... Sure, go ahead, read it.
[02:25:42.569 --> 02:25:45.511]  Our government is not copied from those of our neighbors.
[02:25:45.952 --> 02:25:49.194]  We are an example to them rather than they to us.
[02:25:49.695 --> 02:25:55.919]  Our Constitution is named a democracy because it is in the hands, not of the few, but of the many.
[02:25:56.660 --> 02:26:09.530]  Our laws secure equal justice in all, in our private disputes and in our public opinion, which is welcomed and honors every talent in every branch of achievement on grounds of excellence alone.
[02:26:09.929 --> 02:26:16.691]  We give free play to all in our public life, and we carry the same spirit into our daily relationships with one another.
[02:26:17.451 --> 02:26:22.793]  We are lovers of beauty without extravagance, and lovers of wisdom without weakness.
[02:26:23.253 --> 02:26:29.095]  Wealth, to us, is not mere material for vainglory, but an opportunity for achievement.
[02:26:29.595 --> 02:26:36.797]  And poverty, we think, is no disgrace to acknowledge, but the real denigration is to make no effort to overcome.
[02:26:37.572 --> 02:26:47.676]  Our citizens attend both public and private duties and do not allow absorption in their own various affairs to interfere with their knowledge of the cities.
[02:26:48.336 --> 02:26:55.179]  We differ from other states regarding the man who holds himself aloof from public life as quiet.
[02:26:55.939 --> 02:27:05.483]  He is regarded as quiet, but we regard him as useless and we decide, debate, and carefully, in person, all matters of policy
[02:27:06.032 --> 02:27:08.133]  Stay there, I'll let you finish when we get back.
[02:27:08.153 --> 02:27:08.634]  Stay there.
[02:27:36.596 --> 02:27:39.598]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.618 --> 02:27:43.300]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.682 --> 02:27:49.184]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network.
[02:27:49.304 --> 02:27:51.666]  I have an urgent message for all of our listeners.
[02:27:51.726 --> 02:27:58.810]  The mass media keeps telling us that we are the richest, most powerful economy in the world, quote unquote.
[02:27:59.390 --> 02:28:01.572]  If this is true, why can't we pay our bills?
[02:28:02.333 --> 02:28:05.855]  Why is the United States the world's largest debtor nation?
[02:28:06.416 --> 02:28:10.579]  The truth is that we are in the worst debt bubble in our nation's history.
[02:28:11.119 --> 02:28:14.121]  When the bubble bursts, will you be able to feed your family?
[02:28:15.082 --> 02:28:18.004]  When the inevitable crash occurs, will you be ready?
[02:28:18.744 --> 02:28:20.826]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.
[02:28:20.846 --> 02:28:23.167]  That's 1-888-892-6238 for the following two free reports.
[02:28:32.342 --> 02:28:32.622]  U.S.
[02:28:32.723 --> 02:28:35.626]  debt bubble, red alert, and real estate crash.
[02:28:36.607 --> 02:28:38.909]  Call 888-8XANADU.
[02:28:38.949 --> 02:28:44.455]  That's 888-8XANADU and ask for George.
[02:28:45.598 --> 02:28:47.438]  Dad, can we stop?
[02:28:47.778 --> 02:28:49.299]  We need to go to the bathroom.
[02:28:49.719 --> 02:28:49.959]  What?
[02:28:50.319 --> 02:28:50.679]  Again?
[02:28:51.099 --> 02:28:52.720]  We just stopped two hours ago.
[02:28:52.800 --> 02:28:57.220]  Honey, let's stop, because I gave the kids their Spark Berkey water bottles.
[02:28:57.461 --> 02:28:58.741]  Why did you do that?
[02:28:58.941 --> 02:29:04.742]  Because they can't drink and talk at the same time, and that way we don't have to listen to them singing, Are we there yet?
[02:29:05.042 --> 02:29:06.062]  Are we there yet?
[02:29:06.162 --> 02:29:07.243]  for the entire trip.
[02:29:07.263 --> 02:29:09.703]  Hmm, I didn't think about that.
[02:29:10.163 --> 02:29:11.163]  Great idea.
[02:29:11.183 --> 02:29:13.984]  Yeah, and it's cheap entertainment for the kids.
[02:29:14.406 --> 02:29:16.891]  Bottled water costs around 75 cents a bottle.
[02:29:17.091 --> 02:29:21.480]  And using our Bertie Sport bottles, it costs us less than two and a half cents per refill.
[02:29:21.760 --> 02:29:22.061]  Honey!
[02:29:22.881 --> 02:29:24.122]  You're terrific!
[02:29:24.522 --> 02:29:26.003]  Oh, honey, so are you!
[02:29:26.124 --> 02:29:29.526]  You're the one that bought the family our Sport Berkey Water Bottles!
[02:29:29.806 --> 02:29:30.587]  Now, can we stop?
[02:29:31.107 --> 02:29:31.828]  I need to go, too.
[02:29:32.128 --> 02:29:36.592]  Get your Berkey Sport Purification Bottle for only $39 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:29:36.652 --> 02:29:38.553]  That's 888-803-4438 or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[02:29:46.318 --> 02:29:47.139]  Come on, Bill.
[02:29:47.359 --> 02:29:52.542]  Two weeks ago you were riding a bicycle, and today you're showing up in your new car and telling me you're buying a house?
[02:29:52.882 --> 02:29:54.363]  What did you do, rob Bill Gates?
[02:29:54.463 --> 02:29:56.444]  No, John, I didn't rob Bill Gates.
[02:29:56.724 --> 02:30:02.228]  What I did do is visit the website www.DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[02:30:02.528 --> 02:30:08.791]  That's where I learn how to make $3,000 to $9,000 each and every week, starting with my very first week.
[02:30:09.112 --> 02:30:11.313]  It's a simple program that does all the work for you.
[02:30:11.593 --> 02:30:15.015]  I'm already up to $25,000 just going on my third week!
[02:30:15.275 --> 02:30:15.736]  Whoa!
[02:30:16.076 --> 02:30:17.277]  What was that website again?
[02:30:17.357 --> 02:30:20.839]  It's www.DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[02:30:21.139 --> 02:30:22.260]  Now write this down, John.
[02:30:22.400 --> 02:30:26.703]  You should go there and learn how this program can help you become financially independent, too.
[02:30:26.843 --> 02:30:27.423]  Thanks, Bill.
[02:30:27.703 --> 02:30:28.884]  I'm going there right now.
[02:30:29.304 --> 02:30:29.945]  Check, please!
[02:30:31.668 --> 02:30:33.189]  Uh, you got this one, right, Bill?
[02:30:33.670 --> 02:30:34.270]  Sure, John.
[02:30:34.490 --> 02:30:38.834]  Don't forget, it's www.DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[02:30:39.154 --> 02:30:40.875]  Next time, you'll be buying me lunch.
[02:30:41.015 --> 02:30:41.356]  Deal.
[02:30:51.784 --> 02:30:56.187]  I almost told Chris during the break to stay there, but I said, stay there, we're going to come back to you.
[02:30:56.667 --> 02:30:58.048]  Chris, I want to know who said that.
[02:30:59.441 --> 02:31:02.305]  Great speech, and I wanted to hear the end of it.
[02:31:02.345 --> 02:31:03.867]  I'm sorry that you hung up.
[02:31:03.927 --> 02:31:05.329]  I said, please stay there.
[02:31:05.369 --> 02:31:07.532]  I wanted to hear who exactly had said that.
[02:31:08.693 --> 02:31:09.935]  You said it the first, I missed it.
[02:31:10.696 --> 02:31:17.485]  But I have read similar statements out of the Greeks, and what they were saying right there was true.
[02:31:19.495 --> 02:31:21.197]  We're the complete opposite of that today.
[02:31:21.237 --> 02:31:23.119]  It is all about the baubles.
[02:31:23.259 --> 02:31:24.541]  But the globalists know that.
[02:31:24.621 --> 02:31:30.727]  They're into knowledge, into control of major institutions, and they're into control of information.
[02:31:30.747 --> 02:31:34.311]  Then they give you DVD players made by slaves.
[02:31:34.351 --> 02:31:35.032]  They give you
[02:31:36.012 --> 02:31:40.776]  You know, jewelry and bling and fancy cars if you jump through 500 hoops.
[02:31:41.316 --> 02:31:45.219]  And status to strut around, you know, fancily attired.
[02:31:45.640 --> 02:31:48.141]  And I'm not saying it's bad to go out and look nice sometimes.
[02:31:48.161 --> 02:31:52.144]  It's just that if that's your God, if that's what you put first in life, it's crazy.
[02:31:53.085 --> 02:31:54.546]  You know what I just realized during the break?
[02:31:55.387 --> 02:32:04.774]  I have done 2 hours and 30 minutes plus of broadcast, and I haven't plugged any of my films, the books, the videos we carry,
[02:32:05.643 --> 02:32:08.345]  Because I get so excited and wound up with the things that are happening.
[02:32:08.846 --> 02:32:23.037]  Before I go back to your calls, and then to some North American Union news, bottom line, I've made some pretty darn good videos, and I think Terror Storm is my best work, covering the history of government-sponsored terror, 9-11, 7-7, the Iraq War, torture, secret arrest,
[02:32:25.416 --> 02:32:26.677]  Propaganda in the news.
[02:32:26.797 --> 02:32:28.158]  It is such an important film.
[02:32:28.699 --> 02:32:37.065]  You can get it on a high-quality DVD, almost two hours long, with 68 minutes of extras, making it over three hours of runtime for $19.95.
[02:32:37.245 --> 02:32:42.349]  If you haven't gotten Terror Storm, please get it.
[02:32:42.529 --> 02:32:43.429]  Please don't wait.
[02:32:44.350 --> 02:32:52.676]  If you've seen it on Google Video or at PrisonPlanet.tv, it's better quality at PrisonPlanet.tv, but it's even better quality than that on DVD.
[02:32:52.816 --> 02:32:53.597]  Please get it.
[02:32:55.390 --> 02:32:58.833]  And your purchase makes this broadcast from what I do possible.
[02:32:58.853 --> 02:33:03.016]  9-1-1 Mysteries Part 1 Demolitions is another excellent film.
[02:33:03.416 --> 02:33:08.520]  Just focusing in for 90 minutes on the demolitions with unseen before footage, eyewitness reports.
[02:33:08.740 --> 02:33:10.221]  This is really a home run.
[02:33:11.062 --> 02:33:12.403]  And we have it on DVD.
[02:33:12.643 --> 02:33:13.704]  This film just came out.
[02:33:14.765 --> 02:33:16.206]  It's hard to get anywhere else.
[02:33:16.466 --> 02:33:24.052]  We have 9-1-1 Mysteries Part 1 Demolitions available right now.
[02:33:25.504 --> 02:33:28.646]  If you want Loose Change 2nd Edition, they're about to come out with the final edition.
[02:33:28.666 --> 02:33:30.487]  The 2nd edition won't be available anymore.
[02:33:30.507 --> 02:33:33.508]  If you want it on DVD, we have Loose Change 2nd Edition.
[02:33:33.628 --> 02:33:34.248]  Excellent film.
[02:33:35.689 --> 02:33:41.672]  We have my film, Martial Law, on 9-11 in the FEMA camps and the occultism and the Nazis.
[02:33:41.892 --> 02:33:42.673]  Every film's different.
[02:33:43.933 --> 02:33:48.976]  We have the classic Road to Tyranny, the first big official 9-11 film that I had out within three months of 9-11.
[02:33:50.917 --> 02:33:52.798]  Still available on DVD and VHS.
[02:33:54.053 --> 02:33:59.116]  Please go to InfoWars.com and the Secure Video and Bookstore and look at all the great videos and books we carry.
[02:33:59.436 --> 02:34:00.997]  A new book we're carrying is Hacked!
[02:34:01.357 --> 02:34:02.798]  High Tech Election Theft in America.
[02:34:02.858 --> 02:34:04.459]  It is excellent.
[02:34:04.479 --> 02:34:04.459]  $14.95.
[02:34:04.879 --> 02:34:06.860]  Eleven experts expose the truth.
[02:34:07.881 --> 02:34:09.382]  And you need to get this.
[02:34:09.442 --> 02:34:10.322]  It's an easy read.
[02:34:10.402 --> 02:34:12.924]  It's good to give as a gift to friends and family that don't know the truth.
[02:34:13.584 --> 02:34:15.705]  For those that still read out there, Hacked!
[02:34:15.745 --> 02:34:17.927]  High Tech Election Theft in America.
[02:34:17.947 --> 02:34:20.028]  9-11 Mysteries.
[02:34:20.988 --> 02:34:21.709]  Terror Storm.
[02:34:22.355 --> 02:34:24.496]  Here's the toll-free number to get them all.
[02:34:24.516 --> 02:34:27.197]  1-888-253-3139.
[02:34:27.337 --> 02:34:30.878]  That's 1-888-253-3139.
[02:34:32.299 --> 02:34:41.523]  And don't forget that when you order the videos, when you're there perusing the website, go look at the discounts.
[02:34:41.543 --> 02:34:45.464]  We've got my films as low as $5.95 when you get multiple copies.
[02:34:45.784 --> 02:34:50.266]  We've got deals where there's like 16 different specials on the website.
[02:34:50.686 --> 02:34:51.987]  No, we just added a few new ones.
[02:34:52.754 --> 02:34:52.974]  What is it?
[02:34:53.114 --> 02:34:54.416]  Eighteen specials.
[02:34:55.136 --> 02:34:58.800]  We've got three DVD specials, five DVD specials, two DVD specials.
[02:35:00.241 --> 02:35:01.622]  Specials on Terror Storm.
[02:35:03.624 --> 02:35:05.526]  All these new books and videos we're carrying.
[02:35:06.287 --> 02:35:08.129]  Knowledge is what we traffic in.
[02:35:09.650 --> 02:35:10.651]  Knowledge is wealth.
[02:35:10.931 --> 02:35:11.712]  That's why I love that.
[02:35:12.293 --> 02:35:17.976]  That quote by a Greek statesman, I believe she was reading, I wanted to find out who said that because that is my philosophy.
[02:35:18.357 --> 02:35:21.578]  And that's the philosophy I've come to organically just living my life.
[02:35:22.099 --> 02:35:29.803]  And the founding fathers, you know, studied that system and much of that was incorporated into what we have today.
[02:35:30.103 --> 02:35:32.765]  That's all, people say, well America's failed, Constitution's failed.
[02:35:32.965 --> 02:35:33.465]  No, no, no, no.
[02:35:33.485 --> 02:35:35.787]  We've gotten rid of it and aren't following it.
[02:35:35.847 --> 02:35:36.667]  That's what's failed.
[02:35:39.069 --> 02:35:41.510]  And when they implemented the Constitution, it wasn't perfect.
[02:35:44.384 --> 02:35:48.988]  But people pointed it out and said, well wait a minute, you say all men are created equal, but blacks are slaves.
[02:35:49.508 --> 02:35:50.789]  And so people demanded freedom.
[02:35:51.249 --> 02:35:52.490]  And the abolitionists fought.
[02:35:52.530 --> 02:35:55.692]  They were a minority, 1 or 2 percent of the population in 1800.
[02:35:56.473 --> 02:35:59.475]  Sixty years later they were the majority in many areas of the country.
[02:36:00.096 --> 02:36:02.317]  And of course their movement for change was hijacked.
[02:36:03.338 --> 02:36:03.958]  It was used.
[02:36:03.978 --> 02:36:05.339]  The 14th Amendment was erected.
[02:36:05.680 --> 02:36:06.961]  Real freedom was not delivered.
[02:36:07.841 --> 02:36:08.922]  This time for everyone.
[02:36:11.718 --> 02:36:16.260]  So yes, we're not perfect, but the ideal is beautiful and is better than anything else I've seen.
[02:36:17.820 --> 02:36:21.241]  As the cliche runs, you know, our system isn't perfect, but it's the best thing out there.
[02:36:21.702 --> 02:36:22.802]  Well, we've gotten away from it.
[02:36:22.842 --> 02:36:30.925]  We're going into deep, dark, classical tyranny with a high-tech overlay grid that makes it particularly nightmarish.
[02:36:33.626 --> 02:36:38.547]  Let's go ahead and talk to Lucas in Michigan.
[02:36:38.587 --> 02:36:39.648]  Lucas, you're on the air.
[02:36:39.688 --> 02:36:40.028]  Welcome.
[02:36:40.635 --> 02:36:41.035]  Hey Alex.
[02:36:41.416 --> 02:36:41.856]  Hi.
[02:36:42.176 --> 02:36:43.117]  I've got a question for you.
[02:36:43.397 --> 02:36:44.458]  Sure.
[02:36:45.118 --> 02:36:47.861]  Okay, I'm going to college and I'm in that stage right now.
[02:36:47.901 --> 02:36:53.885]  What do you think I should do in order, like something I could do that would be the best way for me to get the word out?
[02:36:54.366 --> 02:36:56.867]  You know, have the best skills in a certain area, you know?
[02:36:58.409 --> 02:37:03.673]  Well, I think the best way to get the word out is just a selfless
[02:37:05.075 --> 02:37:26.908]  Action on your part to get Terror Storm, or any other film you think that's powerful, and to make copies of it, it's very inexpensive each copy, and then to form your own group on campus, 9-11 Truth, you know, Turkey Foot, or Madison, or whatever the name of your, what school is it?
[02:37:27.552 --> 02:37:28.953]  I'm going to Delta College right now.
[02:37:28.993 --> 02:37:30.094]  It's like a community college.
[02:37:30.134 --> 02:37:31.376]  You said Delta?
[02:37:31.496 --> 02:37:31.716]  Yeah.
[02:37:31.736 --> 02:37:33.437]  So 9-11 Truth, Delta in the name of your town.
[02:37:34.458 --> 02:37:37.140]  Okay, and then start going around with a sign.
[02:37:37.481 --> 02:37:38.622]  Start standing out front.
[02:37:39.224 --> 02:37:40.785]  You won't just fight the New World Order.
[02:37:40.825 --> 02:37:43.127]  Girls will come over and ask what you're doing.
[02:37:43.187 --> 02:37:52.133]  The media tells young men that girls want the drooling idiot who can't come up with any information.
[02:37:52.693 --> 02:37:55.615]  They want the person who's giggling and snickering and on drugs.
[02:37:56.016 --> 02:37:59.238]  And the guys all go out and do that and then wonder why none of the chicks want them.
[02:37:59.618 --> 02:38:04.922]  No, women want somebody who's in charge, who's taken action, who's got a direction, who knows what he's doing.
[02:38:05.482 --> 02:38:09.464]  So it's not that you're out there after women, but it's always a nice fringe benefit.
[02:38:09.484 --> 02:38:12.265]  You're in college, you want to meet a nice lady, you're going to meet your mate.
[02:38:12.705 --> 02:38:15.606]  Go out there and have your sign, 9-11 is an inside job.
[02:38:15.626 --> 02:38:19.748]  You're going to meet the coolest people on campus that agree with you in a few hours.
[02:38:20.108 --> 02:38:21.989]  Then you say, hey guys, let's start having meetings.
[02:38:22.269 --> 02:38:25.851]  Let's get speakers in here locally to speak at the college.
[02:38:26.091 --> 02:38:29.993]  You promote it for a few months and you've got 800 people showing up at the community college.
[02:38:30.213 --> 02:38:31.613]  Pretty soon you're on the news.
[02:38:32.774 --> 02:38:33.014]  Yeah.
[02:38:33.718 --> 02:38:34.179]  Okay?
[02:38:34.359 --> 02:38:36.001]  That's how you do it, baby!
[02:38:36.041 --> 02:38:37.622]  That's how you do it, baby!
[02:38:38.203 --> 02:38:38.764]  Yeah!
[02:38:40.085 --> 02:38:40.666]  I'm sorry, what?
[02:38:41.346 --> 02:38:41.907]  I said thanks.
[02:38:42.408 --> 02:38:43.008]  Oh, you bet, man.
[02:38:43.028 --> 02:38:43.509]  You're beautiful.
[02:38:43.529 --> 02:38:44.190]  I appreciate the call.
[02:38:45.371 --> 02:38:46.112]  Oh, yeah, I love it.
[02:38:46.132 --> 02:38:47.353]  I get excited thinking about it.
[02:38:48.234 --> 02:38:52.438]  There's these two young guys they set up here in Austin like a month or two ago.
[02:38:52.498 --> 02:38:55.542]  They started a project for the new American citizen, the new PNAC.
[02:38:58.379 --> 02:39:13.054]  And they were, you know, kind of little progressive leftists on campus, and then they really went out and tried to do something, tried to go talk to Mr. Government Operative, uh, I'm not going to say his name, it doesn't matter, the fake liberals on UT, the Chomsky wannabes, and they found out it was all a scam!
[02:39:13.794 --> 02:39:21.202]  So they shifted their paradigm into just being freedom lovers, and they've now had, oh, was it like 200 people down there on 9-11?
[02:39:21.242 --> 02:39:21.862]  That was in the news, 200.
[02:39:23.573 --> 02:39:25.254]  They've had articles written about them in the paper.
[02:39:25.294 --> 02:39:26.874]  They've had big hit pieces written on them.
[02:39:26.894 --> 02:39:28.135]  The Republicans, Democrats.
[02:39:29.115 --> 02:39:29.956]  And who was it with them?
[02:39:30.016 --> 02:39:34.457]  ADL, on top of it, wrote some big hit piece in the paper about how dare them protest 9-11.
[02:39:35.178 --> 02:39:37.139]  They've got a right to do it, but they're nuts!
[02:39:37.279 --> 02:39:38.279]  It's like a talking point.
[02:39:39.219 --> 02:39:39.980]  You see everywhere.
[02:39:40.000 --> 02:39:45.402]  And the young neocon conservative group, totally co-opted, wrote some hit piece on them saying the same thing.
[02:39:45.702 --> 02:39:46.502]  Same talking points.
[02:39:49.203 --> 02:39:51.364]  Because they love gun control, open borders, and Bush.
[02:39:51.384 --> 02:39:52.105]  They're not conservative.
[02:39:52.705 --> 02:39:53.125]  They're scum.
[02:39:54.344 --> 02:39:58.827]  And I'm sorry, if you're a young conservative listening to that and you're not scum, then go take over your group!
[02:39:58.887 --> 02:39:59.767]  It's turned into scum!
[02:40:02.409 --> 02:40:13.275]  But these two young men have had 200 people down there, 150 people at another rally, and I'm told it was like 350 last night at one of the halls at UT to hear Seneca Stella, and they're just going to start taking action!
[02:40:14.275 --> 02:40:17.357]  Waking up hundreds of people every single week.
[02:40:18.078 --> 02:40:19.299]  What happens if you did that?
[02:40:19.399 --> 02:40:21.140]  What happens if you decided to take action?
[02:40:21.400 --> 02:40:24.682]  What happens if you decided to make a short film about 9-11, put it on the web?
[02:40:25.603 --> 02:40:30.125]  Your first one might not be that good, or it might be a huge hit, and by hit, it might wake up a bunch of people!
[02:40:31.546 --> 02:40:32.186]  So what?
[02:40:32.947 --> 02:40:34.108]  Get in the arena!
[02:40:34.168 --> 02:40:35.468]  You only live once!
[02:40:37.329 --> 02:40:39.451]  George in Indiana, you're on the air, welcome.
[02:40:39.971 --> 02:40:40.932]  Yeah, thanks Alex.
[02:40:41.332 --> 02:40:44.774]  One thing, I have a very close friend that unfortunately
[02:40:45.345 --> 02:40:46.686]  We've watched the movies with him.
[02:40:46.746 --> 02:40:48.067]  He just can't see it.
[02:40:48.207 --> 02:40:50.269]  I don't understand, but... Move on!
[02:40:50.389 --> 02:40:50.850]  Move on!
[02:40:51.050 --> 02:40:55.754]  Do not catch your pearls before swine dusts off your feet.
[02:40:56.654 --> 02:40:57.355]  That's what I've done.
[02:40:57.375 --> 02:40:58.756]  Now there's one question for you.
[02:40:59.397 --> 02:41:02.039]  Since this whole government is corrupt,
[02:41:02.668 --> 02:41:09.690]  What can we expect by getting the neocons out now, when really they're just all puppets?
[02:41:09.870 --> 02:41:22.694]  Their birdcage liner, because we kick them out, not on the New World Orders timeframe, but we fully discredit them, and we fully discredit their ideas, and then when it comes back in some new reincarnation, we, look, look, this is the good news.
[02:41:22.774 --> 02:41:27.095]  Polls all show it, and I don't mean one poll, I mean whole indexes of polls, okay?
[02:41:27.535 --> 02:41:35.806]  It shows between 75 and 85 percent of the people totally distrust both parties, the entire government, all three branches, state government, you name it.
[02:41:36.367 --> 02:41:38.249]  Just ten years ago, sir, they'd fool us.
[02:41:38.430 --> 02:41:40.512]  Everybody'd hate the Democrats, and they'd hate the Republicans.
[02:41:40.813 --> 02:41:44.458]  They'd double-team us, and people now have gotten the fact that it's a scam.
[02:41:45.279 --> 02:41:48.723]  Okay, so now it isn't going as good for them.
[02:41:48.783 --> 02:41:50.846]  And they're going to keep trying to implement their policies.
[02:41:50.866 --> 02:41:51.486]  They're arrogant.
[02:41:51.787 --> 02:41:52.588]  They've got a plan.
[02:41:52.608 --> 02:41:54.030]  They think they can still do it.
[02:41:54.370 --> 02:41:56.613]  And they're only going to fuel our fire that much more.
[02:41:57.214 --> 02:41:59.517]  Okay, so a collision is coming.
[02:41:59.537 --> 02:42:02.000]  Get as many people as we can riled up for the fight.
[02:42:02.440 --> 02:42:03.622]  It's probably going to get bloody.
[02:42:04.242 --> 02:42:06.664]  And then they're going to be shocked when we clean their clocks.
[02:42:06.744 --> 02:42:08.166]  We're taking this country back.
[02:42:08.226 --> 02:42:08.806]  We're coming.
[02:42:09.006 --> 02:42:12.790]  And a lot of us won't make it to the finish line, but a lot of us are going to make it in the battle.
[02:42:13.350 --> 02:42:14.891]  And we're going to win the war.
[02:42:15.412 --> 02:42:16.293]  And we're going, man.
[02:42:16.313 --> 02:42:17.294]  We're like army ants.
[02:42:17.354 --> 02:42:17.994]  We are coming.
[02:42:18.034 --> 02:42:19.135]  There is no stopping us.
[02:42:19.335 --> 02:42:21.017]  Get the swarm going, baby!
[02:42:21.590 --> 02:42:26.874]  Well, is there any chance possibly that some states might even secede from this government?
[02:42:26.954 --> 02:42:28.395]  New Hampshire's on the verge of it.
[02:42:28.936 --> 02:42:30.517]  Arizona is on the verge of it.
[02:42:30.918 --> 02:42:32.219]  Maine is on the verge of it.
[02:42:32.519 --> 02:42:34.741]  It is openly being discussed everywhere.
[02:42:35.101 --> 02:42:35.661]  It's happening.
[02:42:36.202 --> 02:42:38.003]  And we want it to happen on our terms.
[02:42:38.043 --> 02:42:41.986]  They already plan to break the Southwest off later as part of a Latin American bloc.
[02:42:42.026 --> 02:42:42.587]  That's official.
[02:42:42.967 --> 02:42:43.307]  Yeah.
[02:42:43.348 --> 02:42:47.852]  But no, we're going to do it before they do, and then we're going to reform the real United States.
[02:42:47.892 --> 02:42:50.694]  That's what I think the best... This is a false United States.
[02:42:50.995 --> 02:42:57.401]  A new federation of states, as the Founding Fathers said we should do in the Declaration of Independence, to reconstitute our Republic.
[02:42:58.622 --> 02:42:59.182]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:42:59.723 --> 02:43:00.203]  Thank you.
[02:43:00.283 --> 02:43:02.666]  Yeah, they're racing to get their grit in place.
[02:43:03.186 --> 02:43:05.308]  And they're so arrogant, they think we're destined to lose.
[02:43:05.388 --> 02:43:07.971]  No, you are destined to lose.
[02:43:09.844 --> 02:43:12.565]  We start winning this war when you believe we're going to win it.
[02:43:12.645 --> 02:43:18.147]  We start winning this war when you get the evidence and the facts and stop listening to the infighters and the naysayers and the disinfos.
[02:43:19.267 --> 02:43:23.509]  We start winning when you put one foot in front of the other and start putting up flyers on walls.
[02:43:23.809 --> 02:43:25.189]  When you start putting up your own website.
[02:43:25.209 --> 02:43:26.490]  When you start sending letters to the editor.
[02:43:26.690 --> 02:43:28.050]  When you start your own student group.
[02:43:28.270 --> 02:43:31.111]  When you sit to talk about 9-11 around the water cooler.
[02:43:31.291 --> 02:43:32.732]  When you say no to the fear.
[02:43:34.412 --> 02:43:49.000]  And if they set off nukes and send out a police state and send out their minions, just like Alexander Sholts and Nietzsche said, to paraphrase, what would happen each night when they sent out their secret police if we met them in the dark alleyways and in the stairs with our pokers and our axes and our daggers?
[02:43:49.020 --> 02:43:54.383]  I mean, we've got to be ready for the full-long war for this country.
[02:43:54.863 --> 02:43:56.584]  We've got to be ready no matter what happens.
[02:43:56.924 --> 02:43:59.606]  We've got to be ready to go all the way right now, my friends.
[02:43:59.806 --> 02:44:03.648]  We're fighting a determined group of hardcore killers!
[02:44:05.140 --> 02:44:09.822]  And they don't mind control me, and they don't mind control you, and we know they're traitors, and we know they're scum!
[02:44:10.662 --> 02:44:13.223]  And they're starting to figure out that they've got a tiger by the tail.
[02:44:13.243 --> 02:44:14.984]  They're starting to figure out this isn't a game.
[02:44:15.644 --> 02:44:18.505]  And I want every single one of the criminals to know we're coming for you.
[02:44:19.765 --> 02:44:21.486]  Let's go ahead and talk to Tim in Minnesota.
[02:44:21.506 --> 02:44:22.106]  You're on the air.
[02:44:23.166 --> 02:44:30.289]  Mr. Jones, I was reading a speech by Pericles to the Athenians.
[02:44:30.914 --> 02:44:31.994]  That's right, he said that first.
[02:44:32.334 --> 02:44:36.135]  Pericles to the Athenians.
[02:44:36.175 --> 02:44:37.475]  I want to thank her for calling in with that.
[02:44:38.395 --> 02:44:38.615]  Sure.
[02:44:39.115 --> 02:44:41.156]  I'm calling because I want to thank you for waking me up.
[02:44:41.436 --> 02:44:47.797]  I woke up through a local access public TV broadcast of Martial Law 9-11 about a year ago.
[02:44:48.437 --> 02:44:57.519]  Since I saw Terror Storm, I haven't stopped researching and spreading the news because it proves directly that this world is experiencing 1984 right now.
[02:44:59.881 --> 02:45:04.502]  Because of your efforts through me, your words have woken up 30 plus people.
[02:45:05.663 --> 02:45:11.264]  I want to thank you for taking my call and I'd like to be able to emphasize that I really like it when you take lots of calls.
[02:45:11.665 --> 02:45:12.365]  The more the merrier.
[02:45:12.485 --> 02:45:20.927]  It really helps us in the community because we need more public attention and media and it helps, as you know, us feel more like a community.
[02:45:21.948 --> 02:45:25.549]  Heck, it's harder to talk to you on your show than it is to get on national television.
[02:45:27.276 --> 02:45:29.139]  Anyway, I have a question about voting.
[02:45:29.780 --> 02:45:38.074]  As far as voting is concerned, why can't we just count the votes at the end anyway, regardless?
[02:45:38.274 --> 02:45:40.198]  Well, in the past when we were a free country...
[02:45:41.347 --> 02:45:45.070]  It was at little precincts and that way if you had fraud it was still localized.
[02:45:45.130 --> 02:45:52.054]  Some big centralized evil couldn't steal at all because there were different people at each little precinct and the precincts would count the votes.
[02:45:52.635 --> 02:46:04.702]  Then federal money came in and said, no let's do it on tabulating machines on scantrons at central areas to make it simpler so we get it in an hour instead of the next day like we used to.
[02:46:05.183 --> 02:46:08.645]  And so then the fraud 25-30 years ago depending on what region started
[02:46:10.200 --> 02:46:15.803]  And they were able to start their scam, and you notice they got more and more arrogant from that point on.
[02:46:16.423 --> 02:46:34.993]  And so, yes, we need to go back to paper ballots at the precinct, and then you're going to maximum only have a thousand ballots or so, or maybe a few more than that, and then you have the volunteers down who all count it, and they look at the numbers together, and they post it on their board, then they report that number, and all those numbers get reported, and you add them together,
[02:46:35.638 --> 02:46:36.058]  But no!
[02:46:36.499 --> 02:46:37.980]  In fact, do you know when they really started it?
[02:46:38.340 --> 02:46:41.782]  In 1963, right after they killed Kennedy, they set up Voter News Services.
[02:46:42.263 --> 02:46:59.535]  And from that point on, they had all the precincts report into central booking that it secretly reported the findings to New York at Voter News Services, a private institution with weird guys with short haircuts with machine guns, CIA folks, and then they announced the fake election results.
[02:47:00.282 --> 02:47:02.323]  But they couldn't still steal local ones.
[02:47:02.823 --> 02:47:05.485]  That's what these machines are about.
[02:47:05.525 --> 02:47:08.226]  Before they could steal presidentials and some congressional.
[02:47:08.726 --> 02:47:09.987]  Now it's unified.
[02:47:11.547 --> 02:47:12.408]  Does that answer your question?
[02:47:13.668 --> 02:47:14.069]  Partially.
[02:47:14.749 --> 02:47:16.170]  Where do the paper ballots go?
[02:47:16.190 --> 02:47:18.831]  I know Minnesota requires that there's a paper trail.
[02:47:19.551 --> 02:47:21.872]  Yeah, but they just changed the definition of paper trail.
[02:47:23.053 --> 02:47:23.233]  Okay.
[02:47:24.895 --> 02:47:34.517]  And it goes into a warehouse, generally, for a couple years, and it's a Scantron, and if there's ever a recount, then the same county clerk that stole your election refeeds them again and comes up with the same number.
[02:47:35.298 --> 02:47:37.858]  So, in other words, they're not readable by human beings?
[02:47:37.958 --> 02:47:38.839]  No, exactly.
[02:47:38.859 --> 02:47:39.899]  They're fed into computers.
[02:47:40.079 --> 02:47:40.959]  Even the old systems.
[02:47:41.779 --> 02:47:42.560]  Oh.
[02:47:42.900 --> 02:47:43.080]  Yeah.
[02:47:43.100 --> 02:47:44.460]  Go volunteer for an election sometime.
[02:47:44.500 --> 02:47:44.960]  Experience it.
[02:47:45.200 --> 02:47:45.880]  Good to hear from you.
[02:47:45.900 --> 02:47:46.501]  We're out of time.
[02:47:46.521 --> 02:47:50.101]  We're going to come back and talk to Mike and one other caller, and that's it for the show.
[02:47:50.942 --> 02:47:51.962]  Just a program note.
[02:47:52.788 --> 02:48:04.859]  We posted our big Jesse Ventura interview yesterday with the twenty-something minute video interview and I think it's really important because it's Jesse Ventura, the former governor of Minnesota, talking about U.S.
[02:48:04.899 --> 02:48:06.901]  government plans to stage terror attacks in U.S.
[02:48:06.941 --> 02:48:07.402]  cities.
[02:48:09.363 --> 02:48:15.969]  And the story's gotten some attention but it hasn't been on a bunch of big blogs or a bunch of other big news sites and we need you to help us get it out to everybody.
[02:48:16.470 --> 02:48:18.091]  So it's at the top of InfoWars.com
[02:48:19.924 --> 02:48:22.286]  And it's on the sidebar of PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:48:22.306 --> 02:48:25.949]  Go get whatever version you want, and please help us get it out to everybody.
[02:48:25.969 --> 02:48:28.391]  If you haven't watched it, watch it when the show ends.
[02:48:29.252 --> 02:48:29.993]  It's a great interview.
[02:48:30.033 --> 02:48:32.815]  I mean, I know he's just a celebrity, but the point is, people seem to listen to that.
[02:48:33.135 --> 02:48:33.916]  This is a great tool.
[02:48:33.936 --> 02:48:34.496]  Let's use it.
[02:48:34.817 --> 02:48:40.181]  And don't forget, this Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m., I'll be doing my NewsRadio 590 KLBJ Show.
[02:48:40.201 --> 02:48:43.224]  You can tune in via the Internet at InfoWars.com.
[02:48:43.464 --> 02:48:44.465]  So join me this Sunday.
[02:48:49.250 --> 02:48:52.431]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[02:48:52.791 --> 02:48:54.671]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[02:48:55.071 --> 02:49:02.753]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:49:03.413 --> 02:49:10.474]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:49:10.875 --> 02:49:17.716]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying,
[02:49:18.246 --> 02:49:22.307]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:49:22.587 --> 02:49:26.088]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:49:26.568 --> 02:49:28.489]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:49:28.829 --> 02:49:32.730]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:51:50.862 --> 02:51:52.784]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:51:53.264 --> 02:51:56.066]  Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:51:57.087 --> 02:52:00.990]  That's right, and we each do a little bit of crashing into the lies and disinformation, too.
[02:52:02.832 --> 02:52:04.413]  Often imitated, never duplicated.
[02:52:04.473 --> 02:52:08.156]  I wish people would duplicate the show and do a better job than I do, but they don't.
[02:52:09.097 --> 02:52:30.915]  Trans-Texas Corridor plans revealed, and you read the Dallas Morning News article today, and it says that Sentra, the Spanish company, says that their agreement with the state is secret, and Texas Department of Transportation has told the state it's secret, though they will announce that it will cost taxpayers eight plus billion dollars, 8.8 billion, to build it.
[02:52:31.015 --> 02:52:34.058]  We pay for it, and then it's given to the private company to run.
[02:52:35.416 --> 02:52:36.977]  Here's another one out of the Fort Worth Star-Telegram.
[02:52:37.017 --> 02:52:40.040]  Texas Trans-Texas Corridor Plan unveiled.
[02:52:40.420 --> 02:52:49.768]  The master plan for the proposed toll road and rail line from Oklahoma border to San Antonio was unveiled this morning by the Texas Department of Transportation, but the details are secret.
[02:52:50.829 --> 02:52:53.271]  And it is going to be $22.
[02:52:54.432 --> 02:53:00.457]  It says that driving south of Mansfield to Austin
[02:53:01.437 --> 02:53:06.179]  Would be $22 for citizens driving regular vehicles and $85 for truckers.
[02:53:06.599 --> 02:53:06.999]  Ha ha!
[02:53:07.239 --> 02:53:10.960]  I mean, I've been telling you folks that this is three plus dollars a gallon.
[02:53:10.980 --> 02:53:12.141]  This is even higher than that.
[02:53:12.621 --> 02:53:16.082]  I mean, I could spend... In fact, I'll start the show tomorrow with this.
[02:53:16.142 --> 02:53:16.982]  I should have gotten to this.
[02:53:18.263 --> 02:53:19.663]  And there's these other two big articles.
[02:53:20.363 --> 02:53:21.684]  Jerome Corsi and then another one.
[02:53:21.704 --> 02:53:22.684]  It says, Top U.S.
[02:53:22.724 --> 02:53:24.985]  Officials Chaired North American Confed Panel.
[02:53:26.202 --> 02:53:35.250]  An agency was attended secretive meeting in official capacity was assistant secretary and it just goes into the documents been released it's officially a government and they're already operating.
[02:53:35.530 --> 02:53:38.492]  But I will start the show tomorrow with this barring some huge news event.
[02:53:38.773 --> 02:53:42.676]  Should have gotten to it more but it's up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:53:42.896 --> 02:53:47.780]  And I want Paul Watson and Slick Eisen and Steve and everybody to start writing more on this.
[02:53:47.860 --> 02:53:48.521]  This is the issue.
[02:53:49.705 --> 02:53:50.425]  One of the key issues.
[02:53:51.326 --> 02:53:53.166]  Let's, because we know more than Corsi.
[02:53:53.226 --> 02:53:53.946]  I'm not bragging.
[02:53:53.966 --> 02:53:54.927]  We've been doing this forever.
[02:53:54.987 --> 02:53:55.587]  This is Corsi.
[02:53:55.767 --> 02:53:56.227]  Read it.
[02:53:56.747 --> 02:53:57.888]  It's not hardcore enough.
[02:53:59.068 --> 02:54:00.869]  I'm looking... I'm going to shut up.
[02:54:00.889 --> 02:54:01.549]  I'm going to leave it there.
[02:54:02.429 --> 02:54:04.110]  Mike in Florida, you're on the air.
[02:54:04.150 --> 02:54:04.590]  Go ahead.
[02:54:05.050 --> 02:54:11.592]  Alex, by the time they get these corridors all finished, there's going to be no money left in the state to buy trade goods.
[02:54:12.332 --> 02:54:18.054]  However, what knows would be beautiful to invade and control a country.
[02:54:19.318 --> 02:54:25.783]  Oh, well the interstate was built so the federal government could dominate the lower 48, but that is admitted.
[02:54:25.843 --> 02:54:31.408]  The interstate highways were built not just to move armaments and fight the Russians, but to also suppress the American people.
[02:54:31.908 --> 02:54:35.571]  Yeah, and just think though, from the ports in Mexico,
[02:54:36.845 --> 02:54:39.446]  Uh... Chinese could bring... Well, it is to military.
[02:54:39.886 --> 02:54:45.408]  It invades us with third world labor, third world populations, and third world slave goods to destroy our economy.
[02:54:45.768 --> 02:54:49.389]  And the way they're going to pay for these toll roads is all the other roads are turned into toll roads.
[02:54:49.629 --> 02:54:50.549]  Yep.
[02:54:50.609 --> 02:54:51.289]  Oh, that's official.
[02:54:51.329 --> 02:54:52.670]  That's official.
[02:54:52.690 --> 02:54:54.610]  They can just bring everything in unconnected.
[02:54:54.690 --> 02:54:57.131]  All their tanks and guns and weapons and people.
[02:54:57.471 --> 02:54:58.472]  But see, they won't need to do that.
[02:54:58.492 --> 02:55:00.072]  They're going to fill us up with Latin Americans.
[02:55:00.092 --> 02:55:02.633]  They're going to call for this to be part of the one world government.
[02:55:02.653 --> 02:55:03.253]  It's going to happen.
[02:55:04.473 --> 02:55:06.114]  Well, I'm not going to be there.
[02:55:07.069 --> 02:55:07.429]  I hear you.
[02:55:07.449 --> 02:55:08.470]  We're going to fight it, my friend.
[02:55:08.490 --> 02:55:08.990]  And God bless you.
[02:55:09.030 --> 02:55:09.870]  I'm sorry we're out of time.
[02:55:09.891 --> 02:55:10.651]  Call me back tomorrow.
[02:55:11.051 --> 02:55:12.532]  Cameron in Ontario, Canada.
[02:55:12.572 --> 02:55:13.112]  Last caller.
[02:55:15.613 --> 02:55:16.234]  Yes, Cameron.
[02:55:16.774 --> 02:55:17.354]  Hello, Alex.
[02:55:17.394 --> 02:55:17.734]  Hi.
[02:55:17.814 --> 02:55:18.175]  Welcome.
[02:55:18.535 --> 02:55:18.635]  Hi.
[02:55:18.675 --> 02:55:19.055]  How are you?
[02:55:19.295 --> 02:55:19.595]  Good.
[02:55:20.256 --> 02:55:21.276]  Great to talk to you.
[02:55:21.356 --> 02:55:23.377]  Actually, I'm an American patriot.
[02:55:23.637 --> 02:55:24.338]  I love America.
[02:55:24.358 --> 02:55:27.539]  I love the values and everything that America stands for.
[02:55:28.360 --> 02:55:30.201]  I also love the government, though.
[02:55:30.681 --> 02:55:31.021]  You do?
[02:55:31.041 --> 02:55:31.922]  Yeah.
[02:55:32.742 --> 02:55:34.763]  I actually think that what you're doing
[02:55:35.322 --> 02:55:37.002]  It's actually what the terrorists want.
[02:55:37.062 --> 02:55:42.084]  I mean, as an American... Sir, did you tell them you disagreed because you would have been at the front of the line?
[02:55:43.764 --> 02:55:44.604]  Oh no, no, no.
[02:55:44.724 --> 02:55:46.985]  I agree with our government.
[02:55:47.645 --> 02:55:48.145]  No, I know.
[02:55:48.605 --> 02:55:49.325]  That's what I'm saying.
[02:55:49.365 --> 02:55:51.226]  If you disagree with me, you go to the head of the line.
[02:55:51.266 --> 02:55:52.826]  I would have had you on for an hour.
[02:55:53.366 --> 02:55:53.746]  Oh, really?
[02:55:54.807 --> 02:55:56.947]  Promise me you'll call me back tomorrow in the first hour.
[02:55:57.587 --> 02:55:58.988]  Yes, okay.
[02:55:59.028 --> 02:56:00.648]  So you think the government's good?
[02:56:01.847 --> 02:56:09.489]  Uh, well, I mean, there's good and bad, but I think that, uh, you know, we're doing what we think we should be doing.
[02:56:09.629 --> 02:56:10.729]  Should they ban fat?
[02:56:12.029 --> 02:56:12.429]  I'm sorry?
[02:56:12.629 --> 02:56:13.970]  Should they ban fast food?
[02:56:15.650 --> 02:56:19.431]  Um, well, I guess it's up to the public, really.
[02:56:20.191 --> 02:56:21.971]  No, it's not up to the public, that's the whole point.
[02:56:22.331 --> 02:56:24.612]  The government's doing what we don't want.
[02:56:26.147 --> 02:56:31.157]  If you would like a copy of this show, come to GCNlive.com and reserve it today, or call toll-free 877-376-45.
