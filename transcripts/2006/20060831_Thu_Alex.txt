[00:00:05.427 --> 00:00:06.068]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.728 --> 00:00:07.789]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:09.611]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.271 --> 00:00:11.072]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.832 --> 00:00:12.813]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.414 --> 00:00:17.117]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.577 --> 00:00:21.660]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:31.681]  Welcome, my friends.
[00:00:31.761 --> 00:00:33.582]  It is the 31st day of August, 2006.
[00:00:34.703 --> 00:00:38.186]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:00:38.206 --> 00:00:41.949]  I want to thank you for joining us today.
[00:00:42.009 --> 00:00:59.743]  We have Bev Harris joining us in the second hour discussing the fraud on top of fraud, on top of scam, on top of mountains of evidence of government and private industry orchestrated election fraud going on coast to coast
[00:01:00.638 --> 00:01:04.701]  Nationwide, North, South, East, and West.
[00:01:06.282 --> 00:01:19.352]  It goes along with all the other land grabbing that's happening, the police state, the expanding wars, all of it, criminality by government, incredible hubris and arrogance unleashed.
[00:01:21.254 --> 00:01:27.098]  And then we have a local individual, local activist, big supporter of this broadcast, who's starting and opening a big
[00:01:27.782 --> 00:01:30.283]  Bookstore here in Austin, Texas to fight the New World Order.
[00:01:30.683 --> 00:01:35.184]  He's joining us in the third hour, but predominantly just to talk about his views on the globalists.
[00:01:35.544 --> 00:01:42.265]  It's always great to get the general public's views on what's happening, especially people that are taking action.
[00:01:42.285 --> 00:01:45.106]  We'll have open phones throughout the next three hours.
[00:01:45.186 --> 00:01:48.907]  I want to talk World War III first, when we get back
[00:01:49.508 --> 00:01:52.890]  From this break, I mean, even I'm taking this in too calm a fashion.
[00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:56.712]  We're here on the precipice, on the brink of World War III.
[00:01:56.872 --> 00:01:57.873]  Israel, the U.S.
[00:01:57.913 --> 00:02:04.396]  government, the media, are all hyping war, talking about imminent strikes on Iran.
[00:02:04.416 --> 00:02:07.198]  $200 to $300 a barrel oiled.
[00:02:10.106 --> 00:02:16.308]  We're talking eight, nine dollars or even more, a gallon of gas, the end of our economy, the end of the dollar.
[00:02:16.868 --> 00:02:17.929]  We are at the crossroads.
[00:02:17.969 --> 00:02:25.511]  I mean, this is like being days away, weeks away, months away from World War I, World War II.
[00:02:27.632 --> 00:02:38.336]  We've watched the neocons lias to war in Iraq, lias to war in Afghanistan, lias into a police state and a North American Union, and now trying to pass amnesty.
[00:02:39.907 --> 00:02:42.829]  We're here, at the precipice, right now.
[00:02:43.669 --> 00:02:58.458]  Meanwhile, in other incredible developments, amazing developments, NIST to probe whether World Trade Center 7 downed by bombs.
[00:02:59.999 --> 00:03:01.540]  You heard me right.
[00:03:03.473 --> 00:03:05.855]  You heard me correct, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:03:05.895 --> 00:03:11.301]  Paul Watson discovered this yesterday, hidden in plain view on the NIST website.
[00:03:12.101 --> 00:03:18.468]  They are now seriously considering the fact that bombs were in the buildings.
[00:03:18.848 --> 00:03:22.091]  We predicted this would happen as we proved our case.
[00:03:22.912 --> 00:03:25.775]  And they're going to claim Muslims snuck in there and put bombs in there.
[00:03:26.475 --> 00:03:27.957]  If we continue to win this fight.
[00:03:29.061 --> 00:03:31.122]  I mean this is a victory!
[00:03:31.583 --> 00:03:34.985]  This is so big right now!
[00:03:36.385 --> 00:03:51.774]  This is huge to all the people that laugh at us and claim we're making stuff up and claim there aren't scientists or engineers exposing this to the popular mechanics, propagandists and others over at Yellow Journalism, Hearst Publishing.
[00:03:54.361 --> 00:04:03.065]  The mere fact that we're winning this fight right now to a point that they now have to try to spin the truth is unbelievable.
[00:04:03.766 --> 00:04:10.649]  On the NIST main webpage they put out a report saying they are going to look at bombs in the buildings.
[00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:16.432]  They are seriously going to consider the hypothesis that bombs were in the buildings.
[00:04:16.452 --> 00:04:17.252]  There is no other.
[00:04:20.034 --> 00:04:20.474]  It's 100% on building 7.
[00:04:23.071 --> 00:04:29.213]  You can try mental gymnastics and weird junk science on Tower 1 and 2, but not here.
[00:04:29.713 --> 00:04:32.975]  In fact, now that I think about this, let's get Professor Steven Jones on.
[00:04:33.855 --> 00:04:35.235]  Let's try to get him on tomorrow.
[00:04:35.916 --> 00:04:36.816]  Call him right now.
[00:04:36.896 --> 00:04:38.557]  Call every number we've got for him.
[00:04:38.597 --> 00:04:39.597]  Let's get him on now.
[00:04:40.537 --> 00:04:42.958]  Maybe even 20 minutes in the last hour or something.
[00:04:42.978 --> 00:04:43.658]  Maybe we should do that.
[00:04:44.138 --> 00:04:45.039]  See what we can do.
[00:04:46.719 --> 00:04:48.520]  And then there's some horrible news on the internet.
[00:04:49.615 --> 00:04:51.316]  Wait until you hear this out of Reuters.
[00:04:51.576 --> 00:04:54.677]  Massive censorship in your face here in the U.S.
[00:04:55.117 --> 00:04:57.478]  of the Internet, of mainstream news stories.
[00:04:57.819 --> 00:04:58.879]  We've got them red-handed.
[00:04:59.059 --> 00:04:59.599]  It's huge.
[00:04:59.739 --> 00:05:00.700]  Stay with us.
[00:05:04.321 --> 00:05:04.802]  It's here.
[00:05:05.002 --> 00:05:09.784]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[00:05:10.144 --> 00:05:17.747]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:05:18.496 --> 00:05:25.519]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:37.345]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:05:37.665 --> 00:05:41.167]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:05:41.627 --> 00:05:43.548]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:05:43.888 --> 00:05:47.730]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:06:01.339 --> 00:06:04.903]  Do you know where the 78 potentially active volcanoes in the U.S.
[00:06:04.943 --> 00:06:05.443]  are located?
[00:06:05.664 --> 00:06:09.047]  And do you know the locations of the top 300 crime terrorist targets?
[00:06:09.267 --> 00:06:13.992]  You can find these answers and more in the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA.
[00:06:14.252 --> 00:06:19.277]  With the more than 50 interactive parameters, you can pinpoint natural and man-made disaster areas.
[00:06:19.517 --> 00:06:25.541]  Brewing environmental catastrophes, the safest cities, the best places for solar and wind energy, and much, much more.

[00:06:50.938 --> 00:06:51.259]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:06:51.319 --> 00:06:53.360]  To order on the web or at berkeywater.com.
[00:07:00.658 --> 00:07:06.642]  I used to be ashamed of my toenails, so I thought I was destined to wear tennis shoes through the heat of the summer and hide my toes at the beach.
[00:07:07.062 --> 00:07:09.724]  And then my podiatrist told me about Non-X Nail Gel.
[00:07:09.884 --> 00:07:14.487]  It tackles unsightly nails by clearing out the cause of the problem, yellowing keratin debris buildup.
[00:07:14.667 --> 00:07:19.471]  With regular use, Non-X Gel breaks down and removes the debris, so toenails look clear.
[00:07:19.671 --> 00:07:24.394]  This summer I'm wearing open-toed sandals again, thanks to a topical natural gel called Non-X.
[00:07:24.614 --> 00:07:27.296]  If your toenails are embarrassing, I recommend Non-X Nail Gel.
[00:07:27.516 --> 00:07:30.398]  It's at your pharmacy or mass retailer in the foot care section.
[00:07:31.699 --> 00:07:32.519]  Looking for profits?
[00:07:32.779 --> 00:07:34.160]  Looking for safety and security?
[00:07:34.421 --> 00:07:37.703]  The $10 Olympic commemorative gold coin offers both.
[00:07:37.763 --> 00:07:45.308]  This low mintage collector coin with a total series mintage under $600,000 has sold at four times its current price.
[00:07:45.388 --> 00:07:48.890]  Falling dollar values and inflation make this likely to happen again.
[00:07:49.130 --> 00:07:50.651]  Secure your position today.
[00:07:50.971 --> 00:07:52.152]  Call Midas Resources at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:07:52.232 --> 00:07:52.452]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:08:02.344 --> 00:08:08.370]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:08.991 --> 00:08:11.973]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:28.104 --> 00:08:29.005]  All right, my friends.
[00:08:29.085 --> 00:08:30.126]  Strap yourselves in.
[00:08:30.146 --> 00:08:32.488]  A very important broadcast today.
[00:08:32.508 --> 00:08:45.360]  We're getting into the clear evidence of concerted, focused, organized election fraud being conducted by the federal government and allied criminal corporations in the second hour today.
[00:08:46.298 --> 00:08:56.060]  Right now, I want to play a little short compilation of Fox News clips from the last three days that we have posted up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:08:56.240 --> 00:09:00.281]  Right now, this concerns the gear up for World War III.
[00:09:01.201 --> 00:09:11.223]  The continual hype, but it's not just on Fox, it's on CNN, it's all over the radio, it's all over the newspaper today, as the war drums are being beaten feverishly.
[00:09:11.724 --> 00:09:13.424]  So, first, let's go to this clip.
[00:09:14.255 --> 00:09:25.601]  In a Washington Times article, Arnaud de Borgrave writes, Some, though, think a more hawkish approach is in order, suggesting that President Bush should order the military to hit targets in Iran sometime before he leaves office.
[00:09:25.621 --> 00:09:27.302]  Do you see that as a possibility?
[00:09:44.605 --> 00:09:50.987]  It sure is a possibility, John, and I think the President would hate to leave office with Iran well on its way to getting nuclear weapons.
[00:09:51.187 --> 00:10:06.711]  It's interesting that we're discussing pre-emptive strike now as we get close to this deadline, which suggests that more and more people, particularly in conservative circles, realize Iran's not going to back down, the UN is not going to be able to enforce it, and it's going to be up to the United States
[00:10:07.191 --> 00:10:17.536]  Perhaps Britain, with some logistic support from perhaps France and of course Israel, will have to carry out a strike before Iran gets too far down the road here.
[00:10:18.036 --> 00:10:23.619]  And could the Bush administration prepare to launch a massive airstrike against Iran's nuclear sites?
[00:10:24.279 --> 00:10:26.840]  This hour we'll talk with one expert who says yes.
[00:10:27.141 --> 00:10:32.243]  And I talked to a guest last hour who said military action could be imminent before Bush leaves office.
[00:10:32.463 --> 00:10:34.244]  What about a preemptive strike at Iran?
[00:10:34.324 --> 00:10:36.045]  More and more reports on this now.
[00:10:38.084 --> 00:10:40.646]  And it goes on and on and on.
[00:10:41.486 --> 00:10:43.247]  So we do stand on the precipice.
[00:10:44.108 --> 00:10:46.810]  This just out today, LA Times, Israel
[00:10:47.745 --> 00:10:53.647]  Says Syria, not just Iran, supplied missiles to Hezbollah and that they need to pay as well.
[00:10:54.107 --> 00:11:12.314]  Yesterday, Haratz, one of the major Israeli papers, came out with documents where the Israeli military has appointed a top general for the war with Iran, saying that it is in preparations for a premeditated first strike, quote, preemptive strike, which has been called sneak attack in the past.
[00:11:12.654 --> 00:11:13.915]  It's called aggression.
[00:11:14.918 --> 00:11:15.839]  against Iran.
[00:11:16.199 --> 00:11:24.905]  This on the heels of Iran passing the deadline today to stop the enrichment that is, what, at about eight percent.
[00:11:25.325 --> 00:11:32.450]  It takes ninety-plus percent enrichment to build an atomic bomb, much less a hydrogen, i.e.
[00:11:32.570 --> 00:11:34.271]  thermal nuclear weapon.
[00:11:34.371 --> 00:11:35.852]  So they are not a threat.
[00:11:35.892 --> 00:11:41.896]  Their neighbor, Pakistan, controlled by the globalists, has over fifty nuclear weapons and long-range missiles to hit us.
[00:11:42.456 --> 00:11:47.379]  Of course, North Korea has just as many, maybe more, missiles and warheads, openly threatening to nuke us.
[00:11:47.699 --> 00:11:53.242]  China, openly giving huge press conferences with their head of their military, threatening to hit, quote, 200 U.S.
[00:11:53.662 --> 00:11:57.524]  cities and kill half the United States population, close quote.
[00:11:57.904 --> 00:11:59.025]  Absolutely no problem.
[00:11:59.245 --> 00:12:04.008]  Back in the newspaper, Iran is groveling, licking boots, saying they want to be friends.
[00:12:04.088 --> 00:12:06.589]  They're not enemies of Israel.
[00:12:07.109 --> 00:12:11.152]  Ahmadinejad said this back on Monday, that they want to work with everyone.
[00:12:11.872 --> 00:12:12.573]  We're good to go.
[00:12:33.516 --> 00:12:43.939]  And then a year later, Iran tried to play ball, and then they got called terrorists by the neocons in Iran, then threw out their moderate president, and put in Ahmadinejad.
[00:12:44.159 --> 00:12:58.924]  Because the globalists want war, and the average American out there, that 30% that supports Bush, no matter how he gets rid of borders, or sets up North American unions, or it doesn't matter what he does, or triples the size, it used to be double, now it's triple the size of the federal government, now in the last seven years.
[00:13:00.032 --> 00:13:00.633]  They don't care.
[00:13:00.693 --> 00:13:04.238]  They can't find Iran on a map, but they want to start nuking and start nuking now.
[00:13:04.759 --> 00:13:11.648]  It is literally a chant on talk radio, glass parking lot, glass parking lot, glass parking lot, glass parking lot.
[00:13:11.888 --> 00:13:14.432]  These people have no idea that criminals run our government.
[00:13:14.632 --> 00:13:16.675]  They have no idea that our government's been seized.
[00:13:16.855 --> 00:13:35.223]  They have no idea the United States is literally ending right now, and it will die in the middle of World War III, not from Iranian counterattacks, but by the globalists using the war to get the people to rally around the federal government as it finally breaks the back of the country and brings in the North American Union.
[00:13:35.783 --> 00:14:02.177]  Getting rid of the borders, blanket amnesties, huge drafts, they won't call it a draft, it'll be called universal service, just total Orwell spin, total police state, squads of police all over the street searching everyone, grabbing pension funds, grabbing farms and ranches, grabbing private property, literally running around in an orgy of corruption and looting and bid rigging and strip mining our economy, our society, our very souls.
[00:14:04.767 --> 00:14:07.168]  And that's where we stand right now.
[00:14:07.228 --> 00:14:13.790]  Let me get to the other huge news, and we'll get back into World War III, that we are on the press of the sub, and take your phone calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:14:13.810 --> 00:14:15.211]  What is the huge news of the day?
[00:14:15.271 --> 00:14:17.111]  NIST 2-probe weather WTC7 downed by bombs.
[00:14:26.408 --> 00:14:28.029]  That is a huge victory in and of itself.
[00:14:28.089 --> 00:14:30.271]  I'll tell you my opinion on it and why I think so.
[00:14:30.871 --> 00:14:33.513]  Also, Reuters reporting horrible news.
[00:14:34.153 --> 00:14:35.834]  Gotta give you the good news and then the bad news.
[00:14:36.435 --> 00:14:42.699]  New York Times moves to block web to Britain's raises questions.
[00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:50.904]  PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com is already blocked by the two biggest telecom internet providers in England.
[00:14:51.855 --> 00:14:57.598]  A large portion of our British viewers cannot even get to the site now until they dump their providers and get new ones.
[00:14:57.898 --> 00:15:02.161]  In many towns and cities, it's the sole provider they can get with DSL or cable modem.
[00:15:03.481 --> 00:15:04.702]  So that has now happened.
[00:15:06.063 --> 00:15:11.686]  We are censored out on many universities and many big city and small town libraries.
[00:15:12.498 --> 00:15:15.060]  We are censored out at literally thousands of companies.
[00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:18.122]  We know that we are in the censor program.
[00:15:18.142 --> 00:15:21.225]  People download these programs to, quote, make the surfing safe.
[00:15:21.745 --> 00:15:24.647]  And InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com are listed by those.
[00:15:24.828 --> 00:15:26.069]  We should do a big report on that.
[00:15:26.109 --> 00:15:26.969]  We always talk about it.
[00:15:27.009 --> 00:15:29.051]  We should gather together all that evidence.
[00:15:29.071 --> 00:15:32.954]  We've done a few past reports now that I remember, but we need to put it all together and codify it.
[00:15:33.214 --> 00:15:35.576]  But I forget just hearing about it with my websites!
[00:15:36.528 --> 00:15:41.911]  The New York Times moves the block web to Britain's raises questions.
[00:15:42.371 --> 00:15:44.953]  Were they trying to block beheading video?
[00:15:44.973 --> 00:15:46.614]  Were they trying to block shooting video?
[00:15:46.634 --> 00:15:49.816]  Were they trying to block video marines shooting children and laughing?
[00:15:50.076 --> 00:15:51.857]  Or blowing cars off the road and laughing?
[00:15:52.737 --> 00:16:02.923]  No, they were blocking their own news stories to England under international agreement saying they're under international law
[00:16:04.134 --> 00:16:05.798]  Under the D Notice.
[00:16:05.818 --> 00:16:07.603]  Do you know what a D Notice is?
[00:16:10.291 --> 00:16:17.255]  We have posted London Guardian articles before, where they've admitted government-sponsored terror, where they've admitted government involvement in IRA bombings.
[00:16:17.836 --> 00:16:25.521]  Then the London Guardian has been issued D-notices by the government, ordering them to remove the articles or the paragraphs that documented it.
[00:16:25.561 --> 00:16:27.682]  They issue D-notices every day in that country.
[00:16:28.162 --> 00:16:35.767]  And then, of course, we had the London Guardian stories saved here in the United States, still do, so you could actually read what was said.
[00:16:36.696 --> 00:16:38.639]  Well, now this isn't just going on in England.
[00:16:38.739 --> 00:16:51.795]  Now the New York Times, without England even requesting it, or without any type of injunction, and they're not over our law, though they're now creating a precedent claiming they are, we are going under international control.
[00:16:51.855 --> 00:16:53.838]  This is all in the Internet 2 agreements.
[00:16:54.378 --> 00:16:55.679]  This is all in the open.
[00:16:56.140 --> 00:16:59.203]  Net neutrality agreements to destroy net neutrality.
[00:16:59.623 --> 00:17:09.592]  Do you understand that in the next two years officially the internet as you know it is gone!
[00:17:10.293 --> 00:17:18.040]  So you better enjoy InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com while it's still available.
[00:17:19.881 --> 00:17:31.488]  In fact, Cogent yesterday, for a few hours we've now confirmed, was blocking some through traffic and many areas of the country couldn't even get to InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:17:31.788 --> 00:17:33.910]  This is ongoing.
[00:17:34.730 --> 00:17:37.252]  This is absolutely massive.
[00:17:37.652 --> 00:17:42.095]  And look at how they calmly report on this in Reuters today.
[00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:58.271]  A New York Times decision to block British online readers from seeing a story about London terrorism suspects raises new questions on restricting the flow of information in the internet age legal and media experts say.
[00:17:58.511 --> 00:18:01.053]  See, they calmly report this like it's no big deal.
[00:18:01.713 --> 00:18:14.063]  The New York Times said on Tuesday that it had blocked British internet readers from seeing a story detailing elements of the investigation into a suspected plot to blow up airliners between Britain and the United States.
[00:18:15.126 --> 00:18:28.596]  The story was published in Monday's paper under British Laws Courts Will Punish Media Organizations that publish material that judges feel may influence jurors and prevent suspects receiving a fair trial.
[00:18:30.798 --> 00:18:35.642]  See how that's, so I guess now when there's a trial here they'll say we can't have it in the news, we can't report.
[00:18:36.042 --> 00:18:39.645]  You know back in Nixon's day when reporters reported on his corruption they got awards.
[00:18:40.025 --> 00:18:44.689]  Now Bush has had multiple reporters arrested for reporting on their corruption.
[00:18:45.563 --> 00:18:57.655]  There has not been a prosecution for contempt over anybody publishing outside the jurisdiction of Britain, but logically there is no reason why there should not be, said Carolyn Keene, partner at UK media law firm Wigan.
[00:18:58.015 --> 00:19:07.545]  And by the New York Times, the biggest newspaper in the world, still setting this precedent, and they go on to say that, many other newspapers are going to follow suit, and it's a short
[00:19:08.406 --> 00:19:12.588]  Move from there till they start arresting people here in the U.S.
[00:19:12.608 --> 00:19:13.308]  that report on it.
[00:19:13.748 --> 00:19:29.654]  Already a Houston Chronicle reporter last year that reported on the fact that Governor Rick Perry's Chief of Texas-Mexico Affairs is a Mexican citizen and registered lobbyist of Mexico
[00:19:30.314 --> 00:19:38.979]  That was reported and that reporter got calls from state prosecutors and the Attorney General's office threatening her.
[00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:48.905]  No law, no nothing, just, WE DON'T LIKE YOU REPORTING ON INFO ABOUT OUR OFFICIALS, THAT'S A SECURITY BREACH!
[00:19:50.566 --> 00:19:52.167]  You want tyranny America?

[00:19:56.270 --> 00:19:57.591]  You want enslavement?
[00:19:58.211 --> 00:19:59.612]  You're going to get it!

[00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:01.780]  Gold.
[00:21:02.100 --> 00:21:03.381]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[00:21:03.641 --> 00:21:09.724]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[00:21:09.924 --> 00:21:13.746]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[00:21:14.086 --> 00:21:15.987]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[00:21:16.047 --> 00:21:18.328]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[00:21:18.468 --> 00:21:25.552]  The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as the common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weaker every
[00:21:25.572 --> 00:21:26.212]  We're good to go.
[00:21:43.439 --> 00:21:49.383]  Many people have wondered what has happened to the once great United States of America, why the moral decay that has been taking place within it.
[00:21:49.423 --> 00:21:52.164]  The United States has been targeted for overthrow for world government.
[00:22:13.723 --> 00:22:20.769]  The United Nations has been established to redistribute the wealth of the world away from the United States, Great Britain, and Western Europe.
[00:22:21.649 --> 00:22:30.416]  You need to know, as a specific individual citizen of the United States of America, why these things are happening, and what you can do about it.

[00:23:01.309 --> 00:23:07.894]  The Bill of Rights is a term for the first ten amendments of the Constitution, limiting the federal government's power and preserving the rights of the people.
[00:23:07.995 --> 00:23:10.917]  Each day, we gradually lose these rights that we are entitled to.
[00:23:11.177 --> 00:23:14.980]  We need to take a stand to let the government know that we are tired of losing these rights.
[00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:17.002]  Today, you can take this stand.
[00:23:17.342 --> 00:23:21.826]  Express your beliefs by wearing a new and innovative t-shirt, available only through GCN.

[00:24:01.718 --> 00:24:06.859]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:09.900]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:24:11.361 --> 00:24:17.322]  Getting back to internet censorship, just to break it down how they're going to do it, they've announced it.
[00:24:17.522 --> 00:24:18.343]  This is all announced.
[00:24:18.843 --> 00:24:19.723]  For five years now.
[00:24:21.243 --> 00:24:27.365]  Everything is peer-to-peer, everything, the traffic of the web is free-flowing, they call it net neutrality.
[00:24:29.128 --> 00:24:44.226]  Now the internet will be like a whole bunch of separate companies where you can't visit most websites unless you pay a subscription fee, not to the site, but to be able to get onto the backbone corridor to even visit that site.
[00:24:44.801 --> 00:24:56.305]  And they're talking about hundreds of different subscriptions to be able to quote use the old internet to be able to do that or they're going to offer you the new internet too that the government has paid for.
[00:24:56.665 --> 00:25:01.387]  The conduits, the big fiber optic cables, the big switching stations,
[00:25:01.767 --> 00:25:02.467]  We're good to go.
[00:25:22.509 --> 00:25:34.054]  And then everyone has to pay a subscription fee with one of those big 25 to 50 providers, but they're saying it'll be through the 25 private ones, to even get on to internet too.
[00:25:34.195 --> 00:25:41.538]  So, they let us build the web, they let us popularize it, they get everyone addicted to it, commerce addicted to it, business addicted to it.
[00:25:42.822 --> 00:25:50.788]  And then when it gets so popular that it's part of everyday life, and everything's wired through it, then they force you to switch over to Internet 2.
[00:25:51.029 --> 00:25:58.995]  And they also say they're going to stop updating the fiber optic connections, the big switching stations that are in the world, and let those deteriorate.
[00:25:59.736 --> 00:26:04.940]  Just type in the Internet's dead, and you'll go to Internet 2 websites, Internet 2 articles, and they always say the Internet's dead.
[00:26:04.980 --> 00:26:05.840]  That's their slogan.
[00:26:06.261 --> 00:26:07.542]  Internet 2 has been born.
[00:26:08.002 --> 00:26:09.163]  And this is what they're doing.
[00:26:09.243 --> 00:26:10.204]  And on top of that,
[00:26:11.437 --> 00:26:23.543]  Four years ago, France tried to ban Yahoo and eBay in all of France and all of their 65, what is it, 70 million population.
[00:26:24.644 --> 00:26:26.225]  Why did France do that?
[00:26:26.866 --> 00:26:31.929]  They said Nazi memorabilia was being sold on Yahoo and on eBay.
[00:26:31.969 --> 00:26:37.313]  Now, it didn't matter that 99% of the people buying it were World War II collectors.
[00:26:37.453 --> 00:26:41.455]  I mean, I've been to gun shows before and bought an RAF medal and a Nazi medal.
[00:26:41.475 --> 00:26:42.996]  I've got it somewhere.
[00:26:43.096 --> 00:26:44.857]  Oh, $5 for a real little Nazi medal.
[00:26:45.017 --> 00:26:45.998]  That's history.
[00:26:46.598 --> 00:26:48.520]  Give me that little Nazi party member thing.
[00:26:48.540 --> 00:26:49.440]  It doesn't mean I'm a Nazi.
[00:26:49.580 --> 00:26:51.021]  It doesn't matter if I was a Nazi.
[00:26:51.341 --> 00:26:53.763]  I should be able to buy that if I want to.
[00:26:53.803 --> 00:26:59.984]  Or, you know, buy an article or a piece off of a Nazi Luger.
[00:27:00.484 --> 00:27:03.645]  But they said it's racist, it's hate, it's banned.
[00:27:03.945 --> 00:27:08.046]  Those symbols were even banned in France and Germany, and so you can't do it.
[00:27:08.326 --> 00:27:09.046]  And then U.S.
[00:27:09.106 --> 00:27:14.447]  courts and ICANN and others said, no, no, we're going to continue, and France had to cave in and didn't get what they want.
[00:27:15.047 --> 00:27:21.969]  Now under speech laws, now under denotice laws, now under all these hundreds of laws that are attacking free speech,
[00:27:22.449 --> 00:27:25.451]  Well, the New York Times is trying to create a precedent.
[00:27:25.832 --> 00:27:33.218]  The Supreme Court has said that they're going to follow foreign courts' precedents, and that the European Union courts are above our courts.
[00:27:33.258 --> 00:27:39.123]  That was in USA Today several years ago, with different Supreme Court justices openly saying that.
[00:27:39.563 --> 00:27:40.724]  This is here.
[00:27:40.844 --> 00:27:44.467]  They're already starting to do tests between level three and cogent.
[00:27:44.867 --> 00:27:49.370]  Two of the big backbone providers where they're shutting each other off and not letting traffic go through.
[00:27:49.651 --> 00:27:51.552]  It's causing all sorts of internet outages.
[00:27:51.592 --> 00:27:54.174]  Whole areas of the web are not available.
[00:27:54.474 --> 00:27:57.756]  And they're openly saying that that's what all this is about.
[00:27:58.197 --> 00:28:00.839]  And then they try to spin it and say, well you should have to pay for the web.
[00:28:01.139 --> 00:28:02.780]  You do for your connection.
[00:28:04.281 --> 00:28:08.304]  This has been the only thing that's made telecommunications profitable in the last eight years.
[00:28:08.324 --> 00:28:09.405]  It's been one of the only areas
[00:28:10.749 --> 00:28:13.012]  of the economy that's been growing.
[00:28:13.793 --> 00:28:15.776]  Here's an example they used a few weeks ago I read about.
[00:28:16.096 --> 00:28:21.803]  Your blackberries, your blueberries, your little pocket PCs, your little phones now.
[00:28:21.823 --> 00:28:26.870]  You know, a little bitty phone can get you on Google, get you on the Associated Press, get you anywhere you want to go on the web.
[00:28:27.490 --> 00:28:28.411]  Not anymore.
[00:28:28.491 --> 00:28:40.338]  They're saying it'll be through agreements with the telecommunications giants what groups make agreements with them and pay them or make agreements with them to even be accessible by the phone.
[00:28:40.538 --> 00:28:41.919]  And there'll be thousands of choices.
[00:28:41.979 --> 00:28:50.465]  It'll still feel like it's the internet for you, but 99% of the web will be shut out from you.
[00:28:50.745 --> 00:28:52.746]  This is official.
[00:28:53.166 --> 00:28:53.927]  Call Congress.
[00:28:53.947 --> 00:28:55.508]  Tell them no to net neutrality.
[00:28:56.388 --> 00:28:57.789]  Call into all the radio talk shows.
[00:28:57.849 --> 00:29:00.511]  Ensure that this is a major issue.
[00:29:01.091 --> 00:29:03.252]  They're doing it right now.
[00:29:04.633 --> 00:29:10.336]  We're working on getting Kevin Barrett, the Underwater Laboratories engineer who exposed the fact that the official story is a fraud on.
[00:29:10.736 --> 00:29:12.197]  Professor Steven Jones is traveling today.
[00:29:12.237 --> 00:29:12.837]  We just talked to him.
[00:29:12.857 --> 00:29:13.698]  He can't come on today.
[00:29:14.738 --> 00:29:16.419]  But I wanted to get somebody on to comment about this.
[00:29:16.439 --> 00:29:17.700]  When we come back, I'll talk about it.
[00:29:18.020 --> 00:29:19.541]  Then we'll go straight to your calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:29:22.641 --> 00:29:28.043]  NIST to probe whether WTC7 downed by bombs.
[00:29:28.923 --> 00:29:34.004]  Forced to issue response to 9-11 Truth Movement questions on official website.
[00:29:34.445 --> 00:29:37.085]  This is huge for many reasons.
[00:29:37.145 --> 00:29:41.246]  We'll break it down on the other side and then go to your calls.
[00:29:41.627 --> 00:29:47.848]  The websites are JonesReport.com, InfoWars.net, PrisonPlanet.tv, MartialLaw911.info.
[00:29:51.716 --> 00:29:54.718]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.738 --> 00:29:58.400]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.303 --> 00:30:05.585]  Do you remember when you could eat most anything and not worry about it?
[00:30:06.085 --> 00:30:08.246]  Or maybe weight management has always been a problem.
[00:30:08.747 --> 00:30:14.130]  Are you frustrated, burned out, and tired of fad diets and marketing gimmicks that don't really work?
[00:30:14.670 --> 00:30:20.534]  Do you want a proven system, a long-term solution, to live a healthier lifestyle and properly manage your weight?

[00:31:01.377 --> 00:31:04.378]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[00:31:04.698 --> 00:31:09.620]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[00:31:09.880 --> 00:31:14.241]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[00:31:14.522 --> 00:31:23.445]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[00:31:23.645 --> 00:31:27.266]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[00:31:27.566 --> 00:31:32.591]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[00:31:32.891 --> 00:31:39.578]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[00:31:40.089 --> 00:31:40.730]  What about you?
[00:31:41.391 --> 00:31:46.757]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[00:33:03.988 --> 00:33:10.037]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:33:10.618 --> 00:33:13.642]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:15.084 --> 00:33:20.292]  Alright, we're going to go to Johnny and Jason and Jim and Thomas and Dave and everybody here in just a few minutes.
[00:33:22.475 --> 00:33:27.218]  If you live in Central Texas or anywhere around this fine state, people always amaze me coming in from all over the country.
[00:33:27.618 --> 00:33:30.140]  I'm going to have five events coming up in the next few weeks.
[00:33:30.180 --> 00:33:31.381]  Well, really six events.
[00:33:31.961 --> 00:33:36.744]  Next Tuesday, next Wednesday, next Thursday at the Alamo Draft House on South Lamar.
[00:33:36.764 --> 00:33:38.545]  I'm going to show my new film, Terror Storm.
[00:33:38.565 --> 00:33:41.387]  Then I'll also give a speech and take questions at the end.
[00:33:42.547 --> 00:33:46.934]  We are also going to have all of our books and documentaries and films out there out front.
[00:33:47.255 --> 00:33:48.777]  Can't wait to meet you and shake your hand.
[00:33:49.358 --> 00:33:57.911]  And then the week after that on the 13th and the 14th, on the Wednesday and Thursday of the week after that, I will have two more showings.
[00:33:58.877 --> 00:34:01.999]  Go to Infowars.com and get tickets.
[00:34:02.019 --> 00:34:03.260]  You can link through the Alamo Draft House.
[00:34:03.300 --> 00:34:03.500]  Great.
[00:34:03.520 --> 00:34:04.001]  They got food.
[00:34:04.021 --> 00:34:04.541]  They got drinks.
[00:34:04.561 --> 00:34:05.902]  They got everything there.
[00:34:06.382 --> 00:34:08.123]  Ice cream, you name it.
[00:34:08.163 --> 00:34:11.105]  Not that we need that, but Alamo Draft House, really great place.
[00:34:11.886 --> 00:34:15.168]  Dinner and a movie and meeting like-minded people.
[00:34:15.228 --> 00:34:15.908]  Great folks.
[00:34:16.289 --> 00:34:16.849]  They'll be there.
[00:34:16.909 --> 00:34:17.950]  Great place to network.
[00:34:18.430 --> 00:34:21.592]  That is coming up, so please bring your friends and family.
[00:34:22.093 --> 00:34:28.577]  Also, I'm going to be in New York at Ground Zero on 9-11 starting in the morning about 9 o'clock for that big mass
[00:34:29.837 --> 00:34:35.399]  Remembrance we're going to have, that high visibility project to expose 9-11 as an inside job.
[00:34:35.439 --> 00:34:43.222]  Hope to see you there and over the weekend I'm going to be giving some speeches at several locations and we have that itinerary and information posted on InfoWars.com.
[00:34:44.523 --> 00:34:50.665]  Please visit InfoWars.com and go to the secure online video and book store and order Terror Storm.
[00:34:50.725 --> 00:34:55.687]  It's been out for a few weeks now, the official DVD, the official final film with
[00:34:57.021 --> 00:34:58.722]  66 minutes of extras.
[00:34:58.782 --> 00:35:04.305]  Well, to be precise, 66 minutes from the 9-11 Neocon Agenda Symposium.
[00:35:04.325 --> 00:35:06.766]  The highlights of that out in LA in late June.
[00:35:06.786 --> 00:35:09.187]  So this is very up-to-date film.
[00:35:09.307 --> 00:35:11.869]  And then there's a few more minutes of a few of the little extras on there.
[00:35:11.889 --> 00:35:12.269]  So it's really
[00:35:13.021 --> 00:35:23.292]  It's really 69 minutes of extras, and then the film's 113 minutes long, so it's a little over three hours total on this DVD.
[00:35:23.852 --> 00:35:24.913]  Get Terror Storm.
[00:35:25.314 --> 00:35:26.996]  Make copies aggressively of it.
[00:35:27.396 --> 00:35:32.121]  There's a lot of other great 9-11 films out there that bring a lot to the table, and I'm very proud of them.
[00:35:33.315 --> 00:35:45.370]  I don't want to say any one film is the best, but this is the most hard-hitting and the most wide-reaching, covering the most information, and the biggest historical wide-angle lens, basically.
[00:35:46.171 --> 00:35:51.157]  And it is the most professional I've seen out there, the slickest.
[00:35:51.697 --> 00:35:56.661]  I've seen out there and I know that it is heads and shoulders above any other film I've made.
[00:35:56.962 --> 00:35:59.043]  And Martial Law and Road to Tyranny are excellent.
[00:35:59.063 --> 00:35:59.704]  You need to have them.
[00:35:59.984 --> 00:36:06.629]  We've got big discounts where you can get a bunch of the films together and get films as low as $5.95 a piece when you get a whole bunch of them from us.
[00:36:06.649 --> 00:36:09.712]  So check out all the discounts too when you're on the video in bookstore.
[00:36:11.078 --> 00:36:16.060]  But my one big wish is to bring down the New World Order, and the best tool we've got are these films.
[00:36:16.080 --> 00:36:28.645]  You can just give it to people, they'll watch it, it'll wake them up in most cases, it'll certainly plant seeds of questions in their mind, so they'll start researching and be a little bit more skeptical, skeptical, skeptical, new word, about what we're facing.
[00:36:29.480 --> 00:36:33.642]  So again, Get Terror Storm, a history of government-sponsored terror.
[00:36:33.662 --> 00:36:34.482]  That's the full title.
[00:36:34.802 --> 00:36:39.565]  Available at InfoWars.com or JonesReport.com via the Safe, Secure Online Shopping Carts.

[00:37:01.818 --> 00:37:11.484]  By the way with going to Canada and going to California and going to Chicago and going to all these other places and doing all these events we got a week or two behind on shipping.
[00:37:11.524 --> 00:37:16.367]  We are now up to the day on shipping and shipping it out to you via UPS.
[00:37:17.388 --> 00:37:18.369]  We are now
[00:37:19.758 --> 00:37:24.720]  Preparing to go completely away from shipping USPS.
[00:37:24.760 --> 00:37:26.621]  They are so bad and so horrible.
[00:37:26.641 --> 00:37:31.202]  And we've had big problems shipping out USPS out of the country.
[00:37:32.643 --> 00:37:34.784]  UPS, we now ship UPS internationally.
[00:37:34.804 --> 00:37:35.904]  We just started this Monday.
[00:37:36.613 --> 00:37:39.975]  Because they have their own people in customs and it all gets through.
[00:37:39.995 --> 00:37:40.916]  Or 99% of it.
[00:37:41.536 --> 00:37:45.679]  USPS doesn't guard it and the foreigners just rip through it and tear it up and steal.
[00:37:46.039 --> 00:37:48.000]  It just started steal everything.
[00:37:48.040 --> 00:37:52.303]  I mean, I'd have to say 8 out of 10 packages were being ransacked and stolen.
[00:37:52.903 --> 00:37:54.784]  And so we left the USPS.
[00:37:54.804 --> 00:37:58.987]  The only way you get USPS with us now is if you live in the US and you have a P.O.
[00:37:59.007 --> 00:37:59.327]  Box.
[00:37:59.867 --> 00:38:01.849]  Because UPS will not deliver to a P.O.
[00:38:01.889 --> 00:38:02.069]  Box.
[00:38:02.958 --> 00:38:06.719]  And we don't have any problem, usually, here domestically with the U.S.
[00:38:06.759 --> 00:38:07.359]  Postal Service.
[00:38:07.379 --> 00:38:13.001]  So we are all UPS now.
[00:38:13.241 --> 00:38:17.122]  Just a little announcement, no way to announce it to everybody, but everybody can tune in right now.
[00:38:17.142 --> 00:38:18.582]  We're going to try to post it on the website.
[00:38:18.602 --> 00:38:26.645]  We're very proud that we've gotten away from the United States Postal Service, an absolute fraud, an absolute joke, an absolute scam, and totally rude, and totally horrible.
[00:38:27.045 --> 00:38:31.726]  And I'm not attacking the decent letter carriers and nice folks we know, but I'm talking about the system itself.
[00:38:32.489 --> 00:38:34.030]  Alright, I've digressed.
[00:38:34.050 --> 00:38:44.257]  The point is, also we are now right up to the day shipping, so UPS Ground, you should get an order in four or five days now, when you order from us.
[00:38:44.518 --> 00:38:47.520]  So, very excited that we've got all that caught up and fixed.
[00:38:47.900 --> 00:38:50.001]  Okay, please get TerrorStorm, get it today.
[00:38:50.662 --> 00:38:51.542]  Or go to PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:38:53.852 --> 00:39:11.983]  Download all 15 of my films and dozens of other films we've been authorized to post up there, all my weekly TV reports, in-studio video interviews, the speeches are going up there in the next few days from what happened in Dallas, my speech, Jamar's speech, some other great stuff, another reason to be members of PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:39:12.283 --> 00:39:14.925]  It's an incredible activist tool.
[00:39:15.669 --> 00:39:19.873]  You can just sit there on the site with high-quality downloads and just burn them to disk.
[00:39:20.213 --> 00:39:25.938]  If you like a TV show, if you like one of my films, if you like something else we've done, just burn a copy and give it to people.
[00:39:25.998 --> 00:39:26.719]  It's so effective.
[00:39:26.759 --> 00:39:31.684]  Okay, let me hit the really good news of the day, then we'll go right to these loaded phone lines.
[00:39:33.325 --> 00:39:39.711]  NIST to probe whether WTC7 downed by bombs.
[00:39:40.371 --> 00:39:42.013]  Let me read the article, then I'll comment on it.
[00:39:43.999 --> 00:39:48.184]  Well, I mean, I'm just almost breathless here, speechless here.
[00:39:48.204 --> 00:39:48.945]  This is so good.
[00:39:50.647 --> 00:39:56.815]  And we know the outcome will probably be bad, but still, let me write down why it's good after I read it.
[00:39:56.835 --> 00:39:57.836]  I just can't control myself.
[00:39:59.017 --> 00:40:03.663]  Forced to issue response to 9-11 Truth Movement questions on official website.
[00:40:04.304 --> 00:40:21.581]  The National Institute of Standards and Technologies, NIST, is set to conclude its investigation of the World Trade Center complex by analyzing if bombs brought down WTC-7, the 47-story skyscraper that was not hit by a plane yet collapsed in a controlled demolition style in under seven seconds.
[00:40:22.402 --> 00:40:27.727]  NIST, today, fulfilling four something seconds.
[00:40:27.767 --> 00:40:28.708]  We need to get that posted.
[00:40:29.338 --> 00:40:42.263]  NIST today released a page on its website that is intended to answer skeptics' questions about why the towers in Seven were the first in only three buildings in history to collapse from fire damage alone.
[00:40:43.951 --> 00:41:13.156]  Though the vast majority of NIST rebuttals seeks to reinforce the notion that the Twin Towers were brought down from nothing other than jetliner impacts and heavy fires, the NIST makes the admission that the investigation of WTC7 has been insufficient and that they are now considering whether hypothetical blast events, this is a quote, considering whether hypothetical blast events could have played a role in initiating the collapse.
[00:41:13.914 --> 00:41:24.501]  The report continues by saying that NIST would like to determine the magnitude of hypothetical blast scenarios that could have led to the structural failure of one or more critical elements.
[00:41:25.482 --> 00:41:41.253]  While it would be a brave prediction to foresee NIST investigation contradicting the official explanation of 7th's collapse, this at least shows the growing power of the 9-11 Truth Movement in eliciting answers to long-standing questions.
[00:41:42.092 --> 00:41:46.329]  In Popular Mechanics, infamous 9-11 hit piece, they quote the FEMA Building Performance Study.
[00:41:47.069 --> 00:42:00.281]  As saying, there were no firefighting actions undertaken in the Building 7, and yet WTC Complex owner Larry Silverstein's explanation of his poet quote was clarified to mean removing firefighters from a building when firefighters weren't in it.
[00:42:00.822 --> 00:42:04.265]  The two statements contradict each other, so they both cannot be true.
[00:42:04.845 --> 00:42:11.952]  NIST's discussion of the Twin Towers collapse largely repeats its initial assertions that faulty fireproofing and weakening steel
[00:42:12.512 --> 00:42:14.633]  Well, Paul, you knocked that out of the park!
[00:42:43.729 --> 00:42:53.597]  That's a great article, and also, Paul, I want to commend the listeners that found, we're doing a little Google searches on 7, and found this within hours of NIST posting this.
[00:42:53.837 --> 00:43:00.262]  We, our listeners, you, we're a private, independent, organic, grassroots intelligence operation.
[00:43:00.282 --> 00:43:01.163]  That's what we are, folks.
[00:43:01.203 --> 00:43:02.464]  We are crushing them.
[00:43:02.504 --> 00:43:04.346]  They cannot, they don't have the manpower.
[00:43:04.386 --> 00:43:05.306]  We are an organic NSA.
[00:43:06.548 --> 00:43:06.908]  Literally.
[00:43:06.948 --> 00:43:20.972]  We are scanning, grabbing on the ground, uploading photos, documents, videos, whistleblowers, checking each other's information, cripple checking, a synthesis helping us all get better data, collating, rechecking, mathematical calculations.
[00:43:22.113 --> 00:43:24.433]  Oh man, this is backfiring on the New World Order so bad.
[00:43:24.453 --> 00:43:25.634]  It's just incredible.
[00:43:25.774 --> 00:43:27.674]  That's why they've got to shut the web down, and they are.
[00:43:27.734 --> 00:43:28.554]  They're moving right now.
[00:43:30.395 --> 00:43:33.816]  So before they can slam the door on us, and that itself will cause a rebellion,
[00:43:34.545 --> 00:43:35.245]  Which I welcome.
[00:43:35.285 --> 00:43:36.086]  Go ahead Globalist.
[00:43:36.106 --> 00:43:36.886]  Go ahead and try it.
[00:43:36.926 --> 00:43:37.727]  Show us who you are.
[00:43:39.227 --> 00:43:45.811]  We've got to move even faster to get the word out and bring them down before they stage another terror attack or before they attack Iran.
[00:43:45.831 --> 00:43:53.075]  The more I think about it, I think they will stage an attack still, but the more I think about it, I've really been analyzing it in my mind, attacking Iran just
[00:43:54.412 --> 00:44:05.801]  Without even staging an attack, is a giant terror attack and of itself a giant calamity, a giant crisis, a giant economic crisis of oil prices exploding and all sorts of other stock market problems.
[00:44:06.822 --> 00:44:10.164]  That itself is a huge smoke screen and huge escalation.
[00:44:12.566 --> 00:44:15.288]  Which again, if you just joined us, the Globalist are all openly talking about doing.
[00:44:15.328 --> 00:44:17.670]  Let me briefly get back into Building 7 and what this means.
[00:44:20.595 --> 00:44:27.302]  The Popular Mechanics boys have come out and cited FEMA and NIST and the five different reasons that FEMA and NIST have given.
[00:44:27.822 --> 00:44:30.465]  They've given five different reasons for Building 7 falling.
[00:44:31.646 --> 00:44:33.488]  They've had to retract all five.
[00:44:33.548 --> 00:44:34.949]  First, a fuel oil tank blew up.
[00:44:34.989 --> 00:44:37.252]  Turned out that didn't happen and it wouldn't cause that.
[00:44:37.552 --> 00:44:38.353]  They had to retract it.
[00:44:38.693 --> 00:44:43.438]  Then they claimed faulty steel, but the steel had been certified and tested and they had to retract that.
[00:44:44.335 --> 00:44:50.737]  Then they tried to claim that the North Tower fell on it and, quote, knocked out its central support column.
[00:44:51.057 --> 00:44:55.818]  The North Tower fell, some pieces of debris bounced, and knocked out a few dozen windows.
[00:44:55.858 --> 00:44:56.659]  And I say a few dozen.
[00:44:56.679 --> 00:44:57.899]  You can look at the photos.
[00:44:57.939 --> 00:44:58.799]  It's not even that.
[00:44:58.819 --> 00:44:59.900]  There's a few windows knocked out.
[00:45:00.380 --> 00:45:06.902]  Later, hours later, mysterious fires start inside the different government floors of the FBI and CIA.
[00:45:07.102 --> 00:45:08.162]  The whole building was government.
[00:45:08.742 --> 00:45:24.245]  Defense Intelligence, FBI, CIA, IRS, Securities and Exchange Commission, on and on, the whole thing, city and county and state command bunkers, but regardless,
[00:45:25.316 --> 00:45:26.658]  They've given five different reasons.
[00:45:26.678 --> 00:45:28.079]  They've had to retract each one.
[00:45:28.099 --> 00:45:30.562]  Studies have been done of Tower 1 and 2.
[00:45:31.102 --> 00:45:33.645]  The FEMA claimed there were no central support columns.
[00:45:33.685 --> 00:45:36.127]  It turned out they had the biggest columns of any buildings in the world.
[00:45:36.528 --> 00:45:39.831]  Up until the time they were built, and even after, only one other building has bigger columns.
[00:45:40.232 --> 00:45:41.093]  It was overbuilt.
[00:45:41.113 --> 00:45:42.334]  It was not a lattice structure.
[00:45:43.371 --> 00:45:44.552]  And they lied about it.
[00:45:44.592 --> 00:45:47.312]  All those TV shows, NOVA, all that's a total lie.
[00:45:47.613 --> 00:45:48.513]  That's all been retracted.
[00:45:48.533 --> 00:45:49.733]  They keep running the TV shows, though.
[00:45:50.053 --> 00:45:51.174]  You should demand they retract them, though.
[00:45:51.454 --> 00:45:52.734]  They retracted the actual documents.
[00:45:53.335 --> 00:46:02.778]  And so now they're going to, guaranteed, come out and try to spin this and claim that there might have been some equipment exploding or something that just confuses people.
[00:46:02.858 --> 00:46:07.440]  Or they may do what some neocons have been saying, that Muslims planted bombs in there.
[00:46:07.740 --> 00:46:10.841]  Which, if you know about controlled demolitions, it would have taken weeks to set these up.
[00:46:11.421 --> 00:46:12.422]  We're good to go.
[00:46:28.747 --> 00:46:37.890]  And, uh, the facts are out, the evidence is out, the underwriters have gone public, others have gone public, the firefighters have gone public, people remember them saying, get away from the building, it's about to come down.
[00:46:38.450 --> 00:46:50.894]  All of that is on record, and the establishment's so used to not having an internet, or not having an alternative to the press, that they now desperately have tried to ignore us, now they're in damage control, trying to put out this new spin, and it's not gonna work!
[00:46:51.315 --> 00:46:54.035]  So, just, it's the beginning of the end for you terrorists.
[00:46:54.596 --> 00:46:55.616]  I hope you realize that.
[00:46:56.340 --> 00:46:58.222]  This is an exciting victory.
[00:46:58.262 --> 00:46:59.523]  We should all celebrate it.
[00:47:00.724 --> 00:47:02.205]  This is a serious victory.
[00:47:02.506 --> 00:47:09.432]  Not only do they admit the five past reasons they put out are false, but they're now saying they have to look at bombs in the buildings.
[00:47:12.314 --> 00:47:21.282]  And it shows what propagandists, popular mechanics, and Vanity Fair, and all the rest of them are that have attacked us as a bunch of loonies for believing there were bombs in the buildings.
[00:47:21.382 --> 00:47:22.243]  Alright, let's go to calls.
[00:47:23.763 --> 00:47:26.104]  Let's go ahead and talk to Johnny in Vancouver.
[00:47:26.164 --> 00:47:26.844]  Johnny, go ahead.
[00:47:26.864 --> 00:47:28.385]  Hey Alex, how's it going?
[00:47:28.565 --> 00:47:28.785]  Good.
[00:47:29.745 --> 00:47:33.306]  I'd just like to give you an update on Vancouver and how it's going.
[00:47:34.247 --> 00:47:40.309]  When I basically woke up two years ago, Vancouver was pretty quiet.
[00:47:40.809 --> 00:47:44.750]  Nobody really knew about your films or 9-11.
[00:47:45.651 --> 00:47:49.152]  And now, I can say just from what I'm doing,
[00:47:49.950 --> 00:48:08.000]  I know people are waking up because I wear a shirt that I've come up with a shirt basically that has your websites on the back and it's got some fascism stuff on the front and they basically see your website and automatically want to know where I got the shirt.
[00:48:08.040 --> 00:48:08.940]  They want one, right?
[00:48:09.441 --> 00:48:11.502]  So I'm making more of these shirts.
[00:48:12.522 --> 00:48:13.643]  I'm handing out flyers.
[00:48:14.663 --> 00:48:19.246]  People are just, they're seeing like the the advertisement
[00:48:19.827 --> 00:48:29.309]  of basically the movement and just like Starbucks, they see the logo, they know it's coffee, they're seeing the website and they know what it's about right away.
[00:48:29.329 --> 00:48:33.711]  So what you're saying is now when you wear InfoWars shirts people already know what it is?
[00:48:34.011 --> 00:48:45.453]  Oh yeah, oh yeah and I've had people, there's a fair that goes on here in Vancouver every year for about three weeks and I've been there about five or six times wearing the shirt, handing the flyers out and people are coming up to me.
[00:48:45.714 --> 00:48:47.354]  I'm talking to like dozens of people
[00:48:48.064 --> 00:48:49.525]  I'm not even approaching them anymore.
[00:48:50.046 --> 00:49:07.360]  So, I mean, Vancouver is still very quiet in a sense, but I think people are waking up and once they start seeing that there's more people, then just like that quote says, the more people that know about it, that feel like they have
[00:49:07.856 --> 00:49:09.477]  I'm pretty positive just living here now.
[00:49:28.004 --> 00:49:29.886]  But still, there's a lot of work to be done.
[00:49:29.906 --> 00:49:31.808]  I mean, Vancouver's changing every day.
[00:49:32.728 --> 00:49:37.573]  Well, a lot of people sacrifice their lives, their treasure, their futures to get the word out.
[00:49:37.613 --> 00:49:39.715]  And now it's time for everybody to come out of the woodwork.
[00:49:39.735 --> 00:49:41.136]  They can't get us all.
[00:49:41.176 --> 00:49:41.817]  And God bless you.
[00:49:41.837 --> 00:49:42.377]  You keep it up.
[00:49:42.397 --> 00:49:43.358]  Good to hear from you, Johnny.
[00:49:43.718 --> 00:49:44.940]  Jason in Texas.
[00:49:44.980 --> 00:49:45.640]  You're on the air.
[00:49:46.621 --> 00:49:47.021]  Hey, Alex.
[00:49:48.015 --> 00:49:51.398]  See, I talked to you once before about a logo mark thing or whatever.
[00:49:51.738 --> 00:49:57.663]  I really need to talk to you, like, off air if that's possible, as soon as possible, because I can't really guarantee you'll be alive in the next few days or whatever.
[00:49:57.903 --> 00:50:02.067]  And if I die, the information's probably... the understanding of the information will die with me or whatever.
[00:50:02.767 --> 00:50:05.690]  Okay, well, if somebody's going to kill you, sir, you want to go public.
[00:50:05.730 --> 00:50:10.414]  You don't want to sneak around thinking if you're quiet that nothing will happen to you.
[00:50:10.474 --> 00:50:11.555]  That's how they get you.
[00:50:12.040 --> 00:50:12.440]  Yeah, totally.
[00:50:12.460 --> 00:50:19.405]  So I definitely need to get this into your hands because a lot of people know who you are and you're able to get the information out to people a lot better than I can.
[00:50:19.425 --> 00:50:20.386]  Why do you think they're going to kill you?
[00:50:20.406 --> 00:50:21.146]  Have they told you they are?
[00:50:21.607 --> 00:50:25.830]  Yeah, I've had calls telling me to shut up and that they're having a new world order, blah, blah, blah.
[00:50:25.850 --> 00:50:26.350]  They threaten me.
[00:50:27.631 --> 00:50:27.871]  Hello?
[00:50:28.612 --> 00:50:28.912]  Yes, sir.
[00:50:28.932 --> 00:50:29.812]  Go ahead.
[00:50:29.953 --> 00:50:30.413]  Okay.
[00:50:31.133 --> 00:50:34.256]  They told me that I could end up dead, blah, blah, blah.
[00:50:34.616 --> 00:50:35.176]  I'll wait on the line.
[00:50:35.216 --> 00:50:36.197]  I hear the music or whatever.
[00:50:37.219 --> 00:50:37.880]  Okay, caller.
[00:50:37.900 --> 00:50:41.442]  Look, I don't normally do this, and I can't do this because I work during the breaks.
[00:50:41.983 --> 00:50:45.405]  But I'll briefly talk to you during the break.
[00:50:45.445 --> 00:50:46.927]  Just fire it out, what it is.
[00:50:47.387 --> 00:50:49.268]  When I go to break, I'm going to talk to you in 10 seconds.
[00:50:49.829 --> 00:50:50.309]  Alright, folks.
[00:50:50.369 --> 00:50:51.610]  We'll be right back.
[00:50:52.251 --> 00:50:52.931]  Stay with us.
[00:50:53.051 --> 00:50:57.815]  The only thing we have to fear is fear itself, as Roosevelt said.
[00:51:04.594 --> 00:51:05.094]  It's here!
[00:51:05.295 --> 00:51:10.058]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:51:10.418 --> 00:51:18.084]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:18.784 --> 00:51:25.829]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:51:26.229 --> 00:51:33.074]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying,
[00:51:33.587 --> 00:51:37.648]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:51:37.928 --> 00:51:41.448]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:51:41.909 --> 00:51:43.829]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:51:44.169 --> 00:51:48.090]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:52:56.614 --> 00:52:57.875]  That's toll-free, triple
[00:52:57.875 --> 00:52:58.496]  I think so.
[00:53:18.032 --> 00:53:18.692]  We're good to go!
[00:53:47.549 --> 00:53:50.651]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[00:53:50.811 --> 00:53:56.675]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[00:54:16.637 --> 00:54:22.644]  I talked to that nice fellow during the break and basically people get themselves into these totally paranoid positions.
[00:54:23.445 --> 00:54:25.047]  The new world order is after you, they're going to get you.
[00:54:25.327 --> 00:54:26.649]  Look, I'm a canary in the coal mine.
[00:54:26.669 --> 00:54:27.590]  I'm on the tip of the spear.
[00:54:28.151 --> 00:54:28.992]  I'm out front here.
[00:54:30.336 --> 00:54:32.056]  And yeah, what I do is dangerous.
[00:54:32.477 --> 00:54:33.917]  But they know I put out my information.
[00:54:33.937 --> 00:54:34.997]  They don't want to make me a martyr.
[00:54:35.357 --> 00:54:36.358]  But sometimes that changes.
[00:54:36.758 --> 00:54:41.819]  But for the general public speaking out and getting involved, it's more of a soft enforcement.
[00:54:41.839 --> 00:54:45.280]  You know, your bosses don't like it, or the college says don't talk about it.
[00:54:45.340 --> 00:54:48.561]  But my sister is much younger than me.
[00:54:48.621 --> 00:54:50.281]  She's, what, 14 years?
[00:54:51.101 --> 00:54:52.222]  No, more than 14 years.
[00:54:53.562 --> 00:54:53.742]  How?
[00:54:54.122 --> 00:54:55.142]  Wait a minute.
[00:54:55.362 --> 00:54:57.783]  Yeah, no, she's 14 years younger than me.
[00:54:58.872 --> 00:55:00.073]  And she was in St.
[00:55:00.173 --> 00:55:00.974]  Edward's yesterday.
[00:55:00.994 --> 00:55:02.835]  Heck, I've got it here.
[00:55:03.535 --> 00:55:11.561]  And her professor starts the first day of class talking about Alex Jones, Professor McGuffey.
[00:55:13.202 --> 00:55:16.885]  Intro to Liberal Arts, Ideas and Innovations, Freshman Studies.
[00:55:18.686 --> 00:55:25.311]  And he plays on a big screen TV YouTube video clips of myself predicting 9-11,
[00:55:27.921 --> 00:55:28.481]  We're good to go.
[00:55:41.484 --> 00:55:44.825]  You know, the world is, they just see it in whatever they look at.
[00:55:45.326 --> 00:55:46.446]  Basically, I'm delusional.
[00:55:46.806 --> 00:55:47.707]  Yeah, I'm delusional.
[00:55:47.727 --> 00:55:53.229]  I've been telling you over ten years about the North American Union, and now Lou Dobbs and Pat Buchanan are, and it's all over the news.
[00:55:53.669 --> 00:55:54.589]  And I'm delusional.
[00:55:55.249 --> 00:55:56.470]  I guess there's no plan for a draft.
[00:55:56.490 --> 00:55:58.371]  They just got the bills introduced and they're getting ready for it.
[00:55:58.391 --> 00:56:00.011]  They're going to call it universal service.
[00:56:00.331 --> 00:56:04.493]  And I guess David Rockefeller didn't write his memoir saying they're creating a one world government.
[00:56:05.113 --> 00:56:10.817]  And I guess they didn't lie to us about WMDs, and I guess, you know, I just make it all up, folks.
[00:56:10.857 --> 00:56:12.138]  Yeah, that's right.
[00:56:12.938 --> 00:56:20.483]  And I get emails and calls and letters to the editor every few days, you know, where professors and others are attacking me all over the country.
[00:56:20.743 --> 00:56:21.884]  And it's always the same story.
[00:56:21.904 --> 00:56:29.309]  I told my sister yesterday, she dropped by the office, I said, let me guess, it's some philosophy class of some type.
[00:56:29.349 --> 00:56:32.551]  And she said, yeah, it's, and I did this in front of my whole staff.
[00:56:33.597 --> 00:56:37.259]  She said, yeah, my professor's playing clips of you off the internet.
[00:56:37.920 --> 00:56:39.400]  And I said, is it positive or negative?
[00:56:39.441 --> 00:56:41.382]  She said, well, it's kind of negative.
[00:56:42.062 --> 00:56:42.962]  And I said, let me guess.
[00:56:43.042 --> 00:56:46.945]  It's how I fit the world into whatever I want to believe about it.
[00:56:47.325 --> 00:56:51.087]  It's like I'm looking at the clouds and I see a giraffe in the clouds and there's no giraffe there.
[00:56:51.647 --> 00:56:56.030]  And I'm like this true believer cult leader who just can't
[00:56:57.901 --> 00:57:05.028]  You know, deal with reality, and she goes, yeah, and they mix you in with UFOs as true believers, UFO people.
[00:57:05.768 --> 00:57:07.510]  And I said, yeah, let me guess.
[00:57:08.491 --> 00:57:16.498]  And I guessed exactly what it was, because I know it must be some type of handbook they're following, some type of huge federal operation, because it's always the same.
[00:57:17.768 --> 00:57:31.832]  And they play more radical clips of me where I'm ranting and raving and they tell people that this is basically a cult leader who is delusional and he just he goes out and finds information that only fits his view.
[00:57:32.152 --> 00:57:34.493]  He goes out and you just can't believe him.
[00:57:35.916 --> 00:57:37.237]  And that's really projection.
[00:57:37.257 --> 00:57:42.840]  I had dinner with my dad, my mother, my grandmother yesterday, and family, and I made the point that, well, that's what they do.
[00:57:42.900 --> 00:57:44.701]  They go out and abscond with reality.
[00:57:45.001 --> 00:57:47.062]  They go out and are delusional.
[00:57:47.302 --> 00:57:55.447]  They go out and engage in mental gymnastics to ignore the facts, and deny there's a world government, and deny there's tyranny, and deny there's NSA spying, and deny it all.
[00:57:55.967 --> 00:57:57.808]  My dad said, yeah, that's called projection.
[00:57:58.128 --> 00:58:01.290]  They project onto me what they do.
[00:58:03.220 --> 00:58:05.301]  It's like the BBC kept telling me when they were here this weekend.
[00:58:05.561 --> 00:58:06.402]  Oh, we're just after the truth.
[00:58:06.422 --> 00:58:06.842]  We're after the truth.
[00:58:06.882 --> 00:58:08.183]  And I said, no, this is a hit piece.
[00:58:08.583 --> 00:58:09.323]  I said, I can tell.
[00:58:09.683 --> 00:58:11.524]  You're telling yourself it isn't a hit piece, but it is.
[00:58:11.744 --> 00:58:12.325]  I said, let me guess.
[00:58:12.345 --> 00:58:14.086]  You're not going to put Northwoods in your video.
[00:58:14.806 --> 00:58:15.326]  No, we're not.
[00:58:15.746 --> 00:58:17.047]  You're not going to put this and that in there.
[00:58:17.587 --> 00:58:18.448]  All the key stuff.
[00:58:18.548 --> 00:58:19.448]  None of that.
[00:58:20.089 --> 00:58:21.449]  Just strawman arguments.
[00:58:22.550 --> 00:58:25.912]  They go and build reality the way they want to see it.
[00:58:26.752 --> 00:58:29.974]  They're the modern world that pushes perception as reality.
[00:58:30.714 --> 00:58:32.135]  We're going to come back and talk to Jim.
[00:58:33.129 --> 00:58:34.130]  Thomas, David and others.
[00:58:34.510 --> 00:58:35.771]  And we've got Bet Harris coming up.
[00:58:37.292 --> 00:58:38.293]  Huge second hour.
[00:58:38.373 --> 00:58:40.315]  Stay with us.
[00:58:41.255 --> 00:58:45.919]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll free 877-300-7645.
[00:58:57.611 --> 00:58:58.252]  Big Brother.
[00:58:58.912 --> 00:58:59.972]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.672 --> 00:59:01.793]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.433 --> 00:59:03.273]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.013 --> 00:59:04.893]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:04.913 --> 00:59:09.334]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.755 --> 00:59:13.876]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:18.477 --> 00:59:21.257]  Well, when you're a freshman at St.
[00:59:21.337 --> 00:59:23.318]  Edwards University here in Austin, Texas,
[00:59:24.910 --> 00:59:30.454]  Your first day's work is discovering how delusional Alex Jones is.
[00:59:31.355 --> 00:59:32.996]  I didn't hear this from somebody on the street.
[00:59:33.036 --> 00:59:35.738]  I heard it directly from my sister who took notes.
[00:59:37.079 --> 00:59:41.502]  Just another example of how effective we've become at fighting the New World Order.
[00:59:42.282 --> 00:59:48.767]  How their minions, even people who aren't consciously their servants, like army ants, defend the fraud, defend the system.
[00:59:50.188 --> 00:59:52.750]  I'm going to challenge Professor McDuffie to come on the show.
[00:59:55.271 --> 01:00:00.795]  He wants to teach his class all this stuff, how I'm delusional.
[01:00:01.415 --> 01:00:03.177]  He can teach us here on the air.
[01:00:04.638 --> 01:00:09.401]  Right now, let's go back to the calls in Bev Harris on electronic voting fraud, all the big developments there coming up.
[01:00:10.061 --> 01:00:11.963]  Jim in Arizona, thanks for holding, welcome.
[01:00:13.063 --> 01:00:14.925]  Welcome Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[01:00:15.145 --> 01:00:17.567]  Thanks for calling.
[01:00:17.647 --> 01:00:21.029]  Yeah, I first want to say, I don't want to puff you up, but
[01:00:21.638 --> 01:00:42.344]  You deserve double honor and I work for a defense company and it's based in Michigan but I was out on a road trip here in Arizona and if it wasn't for that Coast to Coast that I listened to I wouldn't have caught you and I want to thank you for being on that show.
[01:00:42.424 --> 01:00:46.725]  I went on your site and I think I was still kind of in a bubble for a little while.
[01:00:46.865 --> 01:00:47.565]  I was one of those
[01:00:48.240 --> 01:01:10.965]  People, you know, they came to the Lord a few years back, but during the election year, I was provoked into voting for, um, GB, and I, uh, hearing what you had to say, man, um, it really, it really did a number on me, you know, and I'm the kind of guy, I like to seek truth, even if it means suffering persecution.
[01:01:11.625 --> 01:01:14.266]  So I'm, like I said, I'm a resident of Michigan, and
[01:01:15.424 --> 01:01:30.290]  When I head back, I'd really like to get in contact with, uh, if you have any affiliates or any kind of something I can plug into over there and get, you know, anything going for me outside of, say, my regular job that I have.
[01:01:30.370 --> 01:01:32.651]  I want to be proactive in this movement.
[01:01:35.012 --> 01:01:36.153]  Well, sir, become a leader.
[01:01:36.253 --> 01:01:37.393]  Start your own website.
[01:01:38.014 --> 01:01:39.354]  Get an AXS TV show.
[01:01:39.434 --> 01:01:40.675]  Everybody can do something.
[01:01:41.335 --> 01:01:42.356]  And, I mean, AXS TV.
[01:01:42.376 --> 01:01:43.316]  Take AXS Television.
[01:01:44.548 --> 01:01:46.789]  It's still in most major cities, most small towns.
[01:01:47.390 --> 01:01:50.972]  Small town, you get a show on access, you might have a thousand people watching.
[01:01:51.572 --> 01:01:53.333]  You know, once you start doing the show and it gets popular.
[01:01:53.393 --> 01:01:55.174]  Big city, you might have 50,000 watching.
[01:01:55.635 --> 01:01:56.355]  Think about that.
[01:01:57.496 --> 01:02:00.358]  A politician will fly halfway across the country to talk to a hundred people.
[01:02:01.078 --> 01:02:03.479]  Now, we need to use those venues.
[01:02:03.640 --> 01:02:04.280]  Use the internet.
[01:02:04.500 --> 01:02:05.981]  All of you need to be leaders.
[01:02:06.421 --> 01:02:08.603]  You are leaders and just go out and wake up other people.
[01:02:08.663 --> 01:02:09.143]  That's the key.
[01:02:11.747 --> 01:02:16.688]  Okay, um, so currently right now, you know, I mean, what I want to do is, yeah, I don't mind doing that.
[01:02:17.148 --> 01:02:18.669]  I wasn't even thinking about doing radio.
[01:02:19.149 --> 01:02:27.031]  But, um, I guess I need someone to hold my hand a bit, because I've never jumped out into a radio.
[01:02:27.091 --> 01:02:34.953]  I know, but I barely have time to even hold my children's hands, so I mean, the problem is all I do is work, so I really can't, I mean, I'm trying to hold your hand.
[01:02:34.973 --> 01:02:37.394]  I'm trying to give you ideas on how to get out there and fight the globalists.
[01:02:38.212 --> 01:02:45.637]  Al, listen, if there's a resource or somewhere you can tell me, go and check here.
[01:02:45.697 --> 01:02:49.099]  They'll assist you with information on how to get this thing going.
[01:02:49.399 --> 01:02:50.000]  Well, it's easy.
[01:02:50.080 --> 01:02:50.920]  I mean, literally, sir.
[01:02:51.380 --> 01:02:53.882]  Whatever town you live in, if they have access TV, go get a show.
[01:02:53.922 --> 01:02:57.464]  If they don't, they'll have one the next town over and the next town over.
[01:02:57.845 --> 01:02:59.706]  A great resource is Micro FM.
[01:02:59.746 --> 01:03:02.868]  If you don't have an Amaranth affiliate for this show or this network,
[01:03:03.488 --> 01:03:10.471]  In your area, get in touch with other micro-FM folks and put up a little 5 watt transmitter and it'll go out 4 or 5 miles and educate your whole neighborhood.
[01:03:10.751 --> 01:03:12.171]  You know, there's so many things.
[01:03:12.211 --> 01:03:14.012]  The key is information.
[01:03:14.052 --> 01:03:14.852]  Start a website.
[01:03:14.872 --> 01:03:17.193]  Start a little 5 page newspaper.
[01:03:17.553 --> 01:03:19.254]  You know, tabloid style.
[01:03:19.374 --> 01:03:21.614]  And I don't mean tabloid as in Michael Jackson.
[01:03:21.674 --> 01:03:23.255]  I mean the tabloid format.
[01:03:23.575 --> 01:03:24.475]  You know, the big broadsheet.
[01:03:24.776 --> 01:03:25.696]  Listen, thanks for the call.
[01:03:26.596 --> 01:03:28.337]  I appreciate it, sir.
[01:03:29.097 --> 01:03:31.498]  Listen, as Pat Buchanan, I remember, said many years ago,
[01:03:32.415 --> 01:03:34.396]  Don't wait for orders for headquarters.
[01:03:34.896 --> 01:03:36.297]  Go to the sound of the guns.
[01:03:37.577 --> 01:03:40.258]  This is a grassroots swarm effect.
[01:03:40.699 --> 01:03:42.019]  We're going to swarm the enemy.
[01:03:42.039 --> 01:03:44.480]  We're going to defend the Republic.
[01:03:46.101 --> 01:03:46.901]  That's how we're going to do it.
[01:03:46.941 --> 01:03:47.522]  We'll be right back.
[01:03:56.406 --> 01:03:59.467]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[01:03:59.938 --> 01:04:01.838]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[01:04:02.239 --> 01:04:09.900]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:04:10.580 --> 01:04:17.622]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:04:18.022 --> 01:04:26.504]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture,
[01:04:26.809 --> 01:04:29.470]  The latest 9-11 information and much, much more.
[01:04:29.750 --> 01:04:33.252]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:04:33.732 --> 01:04:35.633]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:04:35.973 --> 01:04:39.895]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:04:53.400 --> 01:04:58.347]  Now, you can bring Berkey Purification Power anywhere with the Sport Berkey Filtration Bottle.
[01:04:58.667 --> 01:05:08.421]  Ideal for sporting games, camping or boating, or Sport Berkey is small enough to store in your glove box, so it's ideal backup for unexpected emergencies like blackouts, floods or earthquakes.
[01:05:08.761 --> 01:05:11.783]  It's simply the best personal water filtration system available.
[01:05:12.083 --> 01:05:15.525]  So effective you can drink raw, untreated water from lakes, rivers, and streams.
[01:05:15.865 --> 01:05:25.210]  Unlike other sport bottles, the Sport Berkey's patented filter formulation is so powerful it removes cysts, parasites, harmful bacteria, and chemicals like herbicides and pesticides.
[01:05:25.470 --> 01:05:28.972]  It even reduces radon-222, lead, and other heavy metals.
[01:05:29.212 --> 01:05:36.316]  This lightweight, rugged 22-ounce filter is small enough to go everywhere, so take one to work and keep another in your glove box for emergencies.

[01:05:54.676 --> 01:05:58.818]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass?
[01:05:59.038 --> 01:06:00.799]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[01:06:01.059 --> 01:06:07.341]  If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough, the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[01:06:07.642 --> 01:06:13.764]  Using a similar principle, Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[01:06:14.004 --> 01:06:15.845]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument
[01:06:16.125 --> 01:06:16.486]  I think so.
[01:06:39.005 --> 01:06:42.669]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:08.476 --> 01:07:12.178]  Ben Harris is a long-time corruption auditor and investigator.
[01:07:12.198 --> 01:07:20.062]  And now for many years, she has been exposing election fraud, election thieving, stealing.
[01:07:20.942 --> 01:07:25.845]  And we've had die-bold engineers go public and say it's all a fraud.
[01:07:25.885 --> 01:07:34.589]  We've had court testimony about how people were hired to run election fraud, or good old-fashioned hired to jam phone lines during elections.
[01:07:36.002 --> 01:07:43.308]  We know that Senator Hagel was way behind in the polls, but owned the voting machines that people were going to vote for him on, so he won by a landslide.
[01:07:44.649 --> 01:07:51.555]  We know Michael McCall's father-in-law, Congressman from Austin, Texas.
[01:07:52.936 --> 01:08:02.704]  We know his father-in-law, and that was all a product of the redistricting, by the way, Tom DeLay, owns, majority owner of Hardiner Civics, that people then vote for his
[01:08:04.924 --> 01:08:08.287]  Son-in-law on, and they're also his biggest campaign contributor.
[01:08:08.587 --> 01:08:15.713]  These are just a few examples of literally thousands built with back doors, black boxes.
[01:08:16.214 --> 01:08:19.777]  So you can't even look at them under agreements.
[01:08:19.857 --> 01:08:21.638]  Oh, this is a private equipment.
[01:08:21.898 --> 01:08:22.879]  There can be no audit.
[01:08:23.320 --> 01:08:24.761]  There can be no real recount.
[01:08:24.781 --> 01:08:27.223]  We'll just run the same computations again.
[01:08:28.584 --> 01:08:41.970]  Imagine if we have a corrupt elite involved in terrorism, we have a corrupt elite involved in no-bid contracts, in bid rigging, and an elite system involved in all the land grabbing that's taking place, and all the other horrible things that are going on.
[01:08:42.590 --> 01:08:58.037]  They know the people, 97% in Texas are against toll roads and transponders, 90% against open borders, we know 70 plus percent against the war, how are they then going to stay in office and continue?
[01:08:59.341 --> 01:09:02.303]  They're doing it through election fraud, and again, this huge hoax.
[01:09:02.744 --> 01:09:06.667]  The feds have paid for 35% of the country to put in these systems that are totally fraud-based.
[01:09:06.687 --> 01:09:14.272]  A lot of areas of the country already had systems that were riddled with fraud and designed for fraud, where you have paper ballots, but they're fed into a computerized system.
[01:09:14.773 --> 01:09:15.994]  I have witnessed election fraud.
[01:09:16.014 --> 01:09:18.636]  I've witnessed our own county clerk, Dan and Deb Dubois.
[01:09:19.236 --> 01:09:28.222]  In the paper in 98 it said, double counting ballot boxes, falsifying signatures, breaking safety seals, but the state board said it was all an accident.
[01:09:28.242 --> 01:09:33.505]  Yeah, you break safety seals and double count ballot boxes and falsify signatures on accident.
[01:09:34.325 --> 01:09:37.127]  And we just see this over and over and over again.
[01:09:37.447 --> 01:09:38.348]  This is real.
[01:09:39.869 --> 01:09:40.809]  This is happening.
[01:09:41.750 --> 01:09:42.751]  This isn't a joke.
[01:09:42.791 --> 01:09:45.152]  That's why they're so arrogant right now.
[01:09:46.313 --> 01:09:48.134]  It goes hand in glove with the police state.
[01:09:49.611 --> 01:09:54.733]  This country's been bought up by multinational corporations, and they've gone in and bought up the electronic voting machine companies.
[01:09:55.353 --> 01:10:01.875]  I mean, the owner of, the CEO of Diebold says, I'm going to deliver Ohio to Bush, and there's clear fraud in Ohio.
[01:10:03.916 --> 01:10:05.336]  It's, it's, it's incredible.
[01:10:06.036 --> 01:10:10.378]  And again, I'm not a Democrat, get that straight, I cut my teeth as a Buchanan-type Republican.
[01:10:10.758 --> 01:10:13.579]  Democrats in their areas of the country are using these machines for fraud.
[01:10:13.839 --> 01:10:16.580]  So we're getting little, little fiefdoms, little city-states,
[01:10:17.446 --> 01:10:23.729]  But the Republicans are running the national switch over to their system, and it is just a nightmare, my friends.
[01:10:24.429 --> 01:10:27.951]  We're going to have to, if they continue to win, we're going to have to have a secret people.
[01:10:29.321 --> 01:10:31.422]  I mean, we'll have to have secret orders ourselves.
[01:10:31.482 --> 01:10:32.662]  I guess secret societies.
[01:10:32.863 --> 01:10:34.143]  That's how they overthrew us.
[01:10:34.263 --> 01:10:37.124]  And I'm being somewhat sarcastic here, but in a way I'm being serious.
[01:10:37.464 --> 01:10:52.871]  Where you'll have to pose as a globalist your whole life, go to college, serve them, not be taken over by them, get into positions of power, get elected through the fraud machines, and then do everything you can to fight it, but then they'll catch on to that and I guess just assassinate us.
[01:10:54.517 --> 01:10:59.846]  I mean, if they get in their machines nationwide, we're going to have to secretly pose as them!
[01:11:01.429 --> 01:11:06.358]  But the easier thing to do is discredit these machines, demand ballot recalls, demand...
[01:11:07.265 --> 01:11:23.412]  Petition recalls of the electronic voting machines and in the petition drive, you know, have it built into that, that if the petition succeeds or that you then put it on the ballot, that on the ballot it's going to be paper for the money to fund the paper system and to get rid of the electronic voting machine system.
[01:11:23.572 --> 01:11:25.153]  That's been my idea for eight years.
[01:11:25.353 --> 01:11:26.394]  It's the way to remove them.
[01:11:26.694 --> 01:11:27.554]  I hope it's implemented.
[01:11:27.574 --> 01:11:28.955]  I don't know if I laid that out properly.
[01:11:29.235 --> 01:11:32.156]  Bev Harris, thank you so much for joining us.
[01:11:32.236 --> 01:11:35.538]  I'd like you to go through and chronicle, we haven't had you on in about a year,
[01:11:36.178 --> 01:11:37.719]  Chronicle, we're coming up to an election.
[01:11:39.040 --> 01:11:43.644]  You know, blow by blow, all of the incredible admissions and things that have come out.
[01:11:43.664 --> 01:11:44.585]  It's great to have you on, Beth.
[01:11:45.085 --> 01:11:48.848]  Oh, well, how long you got for me to chronicle all that?
[01:11:48.928 --> 01:11:50.349]  We got 45 minutes at least.
[01:11:51.450 --> 01:11:58.215]  I mean, you know, the cases where I've got video people testifying in court, they were hired to engage in fraud, we got engineers going, we've got all this stuff coming out.
[01:11:58.255 --> 01:11:58.976]  Go through it for us.
[01:11:59.456 --> 01:12:03.219]  Well, you know, even Diebold has admitted that his machines are made
[01:12:03.738 --> 01:12:12.804]  Specifically, so that you can change the program at the last minute, and they call that a feature, but, uh, and they say it's only a problem if you want to commit a felony.
[01:12:14.165 --> 01:12:14.985]  Oh, I see.
[01:12:15.025 --> 01:12:22.210]  So, in that sense, really, I don't think we should put locks on the doors of banks, because it's only a problem if you want to commit a felony.
[01:12:22.590 --> 01:12:23.131]  Exactly.
[01:12:23.191 --> 01:12:26.473]  Why is it, I mean, so it's a feature to be able to engage in fraud.
[01:12:26.533 --> 01:12:26.773]  I see.
[01:12:26.813 --> 01:12:27.133]  Go ahead.
[01:12:27.273 --> 01:12:28.314]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:12:28.514 --> 01:12:32.236]  So, I would say that was one of the admissions that is especially surprising.
[01:12:33.601 --> 01:12:45.726]  You know, they keep saying, don't worry about it, the machines are secure, and then we keep finding proof that they're lying, and they're not secure at all, in fact there's no security, in fact there's invitations sitting in the machines.
[01:12:46.406 --> 01:13:02.652]  One of the things we found, there was a group in California Open Voting Consortium that bought a machine on eBay, and they opened it up, and on the motherboard of the machine were instructions that told you how to set some dip switches in a different position to make it function.
[01:13:03.846 --> 01:13:04.547]  Let's be clear.
[01:13:04.587 --> 01:13:07.709]  There are fraud prompts built into the machines.
[01:13:07.949 --> 01:13:08.189]  Right.
[01:13:09.190 --> 01:13:12.452]  So, I mean, this is not... There's one I have.
[01:13:12.512 --> 01:13:14.913]  I have a voting machine on the table in front of me right now.
[01:13:14.973 --> 01:13:16.855]  We bought one from a bankruptcy sale.
[01:13:16.975 --> 01:13:23.259]  I mean, this is what's great is citizens are going out there and they're getting a hold of these things and looking at them and seeing all the lies that have been told.
[01:13:23.863 --> 01:13:27.145]  Because during an election, let's be clear, they won't let you get into them.
[01:13:27.425 --> 01:13:29.726]  They say it's proprietary and private.
[01:13:30.046 --> 01:13:33.468]  Oh yes, and they lead you down the garden path and tell you all these wonderful things.
[01:13:33.528 --> 01:13:41.411]  The dog and pony show we get in my county, now there's a machine here that's used to count the absentee ballots in several places in Texas.
[01:13:41.472 --> 01:13:42.832]  It's an optical scan machine.
[01:13:43.012 --> 01:13:47.014]  It's probably the second widest used machine in the U.S.
[01:13:47.114 --> 01:13:48.695]  It counts about 25 million votes out
[01:13:49.574 --> 01:13:52.795]  It's the old system Austin had before they went to the total fraud machines.
[01:13:53.075 --> 01:13:53.515]  Right, right.
[01:13:53.555 --> 01:14:04.159]  Well, so this particular one, of course, this is the one we hacked in Florida where we just basically took the memory card, which is like a disk, and just stuffed it, pre-stuffed the ballot box.
[01:14:04.219 --> 01:14:04.880]  No one could tell.
[01:14:04.940 --> 01:14:06.100]  It completely rigged the election.
[01:14:06.750 --> 01:14:17.994]  And they said, don't worry about that, because you see, we have a special metal plate that's a door over it, which we then seal with a numbered plastic seal, and it just looks great, right?
[01:14:18.434 --> 01:14:26.697]  Now, so I've seen this, I've heard their song and dance, so we bought one of the machines and actually have it sealed up using the exact stuff that they use.
[01:14:28.098 --> 01:14:30.779]  It took us, uh, let's see, me and um,
[01:14:31.789 --> 01:14:37.133]  My administrative assistant, Natalie, we're both in our 50s, and it's not particularly handy.
[01:14:38.114 --> 01:14:42.397]  It took us two minutes to completely remove the seal, leaving no trace.
[01:14:43.037 --> 01:14:44.318]  It was a complete joke.
[01:14:44.398 --> 01:14:45.359]  It's a complete sham.
[01:14:45.439 --> 01:14:55.506]  In other words, it did cost us $12 because we had to go and buy a Phillips head screwdriver and a needle nose pliers to unscrew the washer.
[01:14:55.727 --> 01:14:56.487]  That was all it was.
[01:14:56.567 --> 01:14:59.009]  It was just such a ridiculous sham.
[01:14:59.713 --> 01:15:01.134]  And they're saying, well, you can't get at it.
[01:15:01.194 --> 01:15:02.555]  And it's all for show.
[01:15:02.855 --> 01:15:07.959]  Because they have to have known that all you have to do is unscrew a couple screws and it pops off.
[01:15:08.059 --> 01:15:10.340]  And then you screw it right back in and no one can see you did.
[01:15:10.440 --> 01:15:21.267]  Now, Bev, state legislatures, high-powered attorneys have gone to the companies, the big four, and said, will you please just take the fraud switches out?
[01:15:21.628 --> 01:15:23.989]  Will you please take the wireless system out?
[01:15:24.430 --> 01:15:25.931]  That isn't even, by the way, part of the system.
[01:15:25.951 --> 01:15:27.432]  They just said they add that for fun.
[01:15:27.452 --> 01:15:29.553]  And they go, no, we're not going to take it out.
[01:15:30.534 --> 01:15:49.128]  Oh yeah, well, and then when they do, they... I have a videotape that I took this week of an election official, and I said, look, I have now opened up the voting machine for this one model he was, you know, testing, and it doesn't matter which model, you know, they're kind of all the same problem.
[01:15:49.468 --> 01:15:54.192]  But, and I said, and in it is a slot for a wireless card.
[01:15:54.632 --> 01:15:57.915]  Now, in the one I opened, there was nothing in the slot.
[01:15:57.955 --> 01:15:59.536]  There was no wireless card in the slot.
[01:15:59.895 --> 01:16:02.597]  But you're sitting here with 500 voting machines like this.
[01:16:03.357 --> 01:16:06.379]  How do we know that those slots are empty?
[01:16:06.839 --> 01:16:09.721]  And he said, well, I'm not going to crack them open and look.
[01:16:11.462 --> 01:16:17.086]  Well, so in other words, you don't know at all what's in the machines.
[01:16:17.226 --> 01:16:19.648]  And secondly, why is it built in there?
[01:16:19.728 --> 01:16:21.729]  Why did they put a slot in there for something?
[01:16:22.610 --> 01:16:24.851]  It's like they had to go to some extra effort to do it.
[01:16:25.672 --> 01:16:28.734]  Now, now, Bev, you're just being a conspiracy theorist.
[01:16:29.810 --> 01:16:35.014]  It's no big deal to have all these... It's no big deal to have all these congressmen that own the voting machine companies.
[01:16:35.034 --> 01:16:35.994]  People vote for them all.
[01:16:36.034 --> 01:16:37.475]  I mean, that's completely normal.
[01:16:38.296 --> 01:16:38.996]  And look at this.
[01:16:39.016 --> 01:16:42.159]  You've got Hart InterCivic in quite a bit of Texas, right?
[01:16:42.939 --> 01:16:46.301]  I mean, it isn't even just the potential for fraud.
[01:16:46.381 --> 01:16:48.103]  It's also, they don't even work well.
[01:16:48.543 --> 01:16:54.267]  You've got a write-in candidate down there that they're trying to, like, shuffle into place for Tom DeLay, I think, from what I understand.
[01:16:54.747 --> 01:16:57.109]  And she's got a big, long, hyphenated last name.
[01:16:57.749 --> 01:16:58.890]  And you can't write
[01:16:59.477 --> 01:17:00.117]  On a touch screen.
[01:17:00.137 --> 01:17:01.978]  Well, a guy in Ohio did try that, by the way.
[01:17:02.018 --> 01:17:08.182]  In the last Ohio election, he didn't understand what he was supposed to do, so he got out a pen and started writing on the touch screen, which I thought was pretty funny.
[01:17:08.622 --> 01:17:18.728]  But, um, you're supposed to, like, key in the whole name of the person on the touch screen when you write it in, but you can't even do it with a touch screen in Hard Inner Civic.
[01:17:18.748 --> 01:17:21.549]  You have to roll a wheel and then look to see what it does.
[01:17:22.150 --> 01:17:26.032]  It's this complicated... I mean, you ought to be able to...
[01:17:26.773 --> 01:17:27.734]  I'm not sure.
[01:17:27.774 --> 01:17:29.214]  I can't say one way or another.
[01:17:29.234 --> 01:17:30.575]  We're a non-profit organization.
[01:17:30.595 --> 01:17:33.416]  I can't say one way or another whether candidates are good, bad, or indifferent.
[01:17:33.856 --> 01:17:40.119]  But it has been a long-standing tradition that we can do write-in votes in the United States.
[01:17:41.179 --> 01:17:55.005]  And you can't write them in on a touchscreen, so you have this complicated dance you do where you have to remember how they spell their name, and then you do the wheel, and then the wheel goes to the screen, and then the screen goes to the little
[01:17:55.444 --> 01:17:58.086]  You don't even have a little receipt in Texas.
[01:17:58.506 --> 01:18:01.908]  You just have to hope it goes to the little record.
[01:18:03.729 --> 01:18:04.390]  It's crazy.
[01:18:05.250 --> 01:18:07.692]  It's completely changed the way we do elections.
[01:18:08.112 --> 01:18:14.256]  And citizens are finding that it doesn't matter what they say, do, or prove.
[01:18:15.476 --> 01:18:16.157]  It doesn't matter.
[01:18:16.877 --> 01:18:17.878]  It's going to stay the way it is.
[01:18:19.281 --> 01:18:20.281]  Like every other issue.
[01:18:20.301 --> 01:18:25.963]  Have you noticed since they put all these new systems in that suddenly government across the board is a hundred times more arrogant?
[01:18:26.283 --> 01:18:26.743]  Oh yeah.
[01:18:30.244 --> 01:18:30.824]  It's incredible.
[01:18:31.004 --> 01:18:33.885]  You know people say well something this big it would go public.
[01:18:34.225 --> 01:18:40.206]  When we get back there have been testimonies where people have gotten up and sworn in testimony that they were hired to engage in fraud.
[01:18:41.127 --> 01:18:42.627]  All that's coming out and still
[01:18:44.412 --> 01:18:45.092]  It's unbelievable.
[01:18:45.132 --> 01:18:45.973]  Bev Harris, stay with us.
[01:18:45.993 --> 01:18:47.214]  I want to chronicle all this.
[01:18:47.274 --> 01:18:51.076]  On the other side of this quick break, we'll also give out your website for your fine organization.
[01:18:55.038 --> 01:18:56.078]  The War on Terrorism.
[01:18:56.419 --> 01:18:59.200]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[01:18:59.460 --> 01:19:03.602]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[01:19:04.043 --> 01:19:04.863]  So what do you do?
[01:19:05.203 --> 01:19:09.786]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[01:19:10.246 --> 01:19:12.387]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[01:19:12.867 --> 01:19:13.728]  Sheltering in place.
[01:19:14.164 --> 01:19:27.548]  Surviving Acts of Terrorism from Biological, Chemical, and Radioactive Fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[01:19:27.588 --> 01:19:34.710]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[01:19:35.010 --> 01:19:38.171]  Get this critical video every American needs for only $29 plus shipping.
[01:19:39.851 --> 01:19:41.874]  Order by calling New Millennium today at 888-803-4438.
[01:19:41.994 --> 01:19:42.695]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:19:42.775 --> 01:19:44.277]  Or order on the web at Berkeywater.com.
[01:19:54.953 --> 01:19:55.995]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:19:56.395 --> 01:20:01.882]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[01:20:02.463 --> 01:20:02.964]  That's right.
[01:20:03.264 --> 01:20:05.567]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[01:20:06.128 --> 01:20:13.037]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[01:20:13.593 --> 01:20:21.301]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[01:20:21.721 --> 01:20:26.526]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[01:20:27.199 --> 01:20:32.224]  If you'd like to take a look at gold free retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[01:20:33.025 --> 01:20:37.149]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[01:20:37.530 --> 01:20:37.790]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:20:37.810 --> 01:20:39.732]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[01:20:39.812 --> 01:20:40.112]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:20:40.413 --> 01:20:40.673]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:20:59.077 --> 01:21:04.279]  One of America's greatest patriots, Patrick Henry, said, give me liberty or give me death.
[01:21:05.220 --> 01:21:18.445]  It was Patrick Henry who forced the Bill of Rights to be added to the Constitution, your unalienable or unchangeable right to religious freedom, freedom of the press, freedom of speech, or the right to own a gun.
[01:21:19.245 --> 01:21:24.527]  There are certain movements underway to strip you of these unalienable, unchangeable rights today.
[01:21:25.427 --> 01:21:32.711]  To help you grasp the loss of these freedoms, we'll send you absolutely free a one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[01:21:33.472 --> 01:21:34.012]  Just call 1-800-516-8736.
[01:21:34.032 --> 01:21:34.332]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[01:21:34.372 --> 01:21:36.133]  It's absolutely free.
[01:21:36.354 --> 01:21:40.116]  Operators are standing by to assist you.
[01:21:40.156 --> 01:21:40.736]  Just call right now.
[01:21:53.504 --> 01:21:55.985]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network.
[01:21:56.105 --> 01:21:58.467]  I have an urgent message for all of our listeners.
[01:21:58.527 --> 01:22:05.610]  The mass media keeps telling us that we are the richest, most powerful economy in the world, quote unquote.
[01:22:06.190 --> 01:22:08.492]  If this is true, why can't we pay our bills?
[01:22:09.152 --> 01:22:12.694]  Why is the United States the world's largest debtor nation?
[01:22:13.234 --> 01:22:17.376]  The truth is, is that we are in the worst debt bubble in our nation's history.
[01:22:17.956 --> 01:22:20.898]  When the bubble bursts, will you be able to feed your family?
[01:22:21.883 --> 01:22:24.804]  When the inevitable crash occurs, will you be ready?
[01:22:25.544 --> 01:22:31.545]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.
[01:22:31.805 --> 01:22:34.626]  That's 1-888-892-6238.
[01:22:34.866 --> 01:22:38.287]  For the following two free reports.
[01:22:39.167 --> 01:22:39.447]  U.S.
[01:22:39.547 --> 01:22:42.448]  Debt Bubble, Red Alert, and Real Estate Crash.
[01:22:43.408 --> 01:22:45.709]  Call 888-XANADU.
[01:22:45.769 --> 01:22:49.950]  That's 888-XANADU.
[01:22:50.290 --> 01:22:51.250]  And ask for George.
[01:22:53.513 --> 01:22:55.695]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:22:56.276 --> 01:22:59.060]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:23:05.040 --> 01:23:06.220]  Bev Harris is our guest.
[01:23:06.700 --> 01:23:09.001]  Bev, the latest news, the latest info.
[01:23:09.261 --> 01:23:12.722]  I want to talk about solutions, ways to turn this around, ideas you've got.
[01:23:13.322 --> 01:23:16.743]  Can you run through, just in the last six, eight months, the different developments?
[01:23:16.763 --> 01:23:25.324]  I know I'm aware of a lot of them, but every time I go to your website, you have, every day, scores of new mainstream articles where they admit fraud in plain view.
[01:23:25.685 --> 01:23:27.625]  It's like they're letting us know, but nothing happens.
[01:23:28.125 --> 01:23:32.286]  Yeah, I think it's a problem that's really
[01:23:33.263 --> 01:23:36.705]  Just beginning to scratch the surface of how deep it goes.
[01:23:37.666 --> 01:23:39.467]  And it's hard for people to look at.
[01:23:39.507 --> 01:23:41.628]  A lot of people, it's really hard for them to look.
[01:23:41.668 --> 01:23:44.669]  It's like going by a bad car accident.
[01:23:44.689 --> 01:23:46.571]  You don't want to really see what it is.
[01:23:47.631 --> 01:23:50.173]  And it's taken a while to grow this way.
[01:23:50.213 --> 01:23:54.175]  It's taken at least 20 years to get this way because people kind of were asleep at the wheel.
[01:23:54.935 --> 01:23:59.678]  But what's happening is people are, citizens all over the country,
[01:24:00.151 --> 01:24:26.305]  People are starting to get it, and they're starting to go out into the field, you know, getting away from the internet, getting away from just letter writing and stuff, and they're starting to go and visit, you know, and ask questions, and when they do that, they often run into a brick wall, they're obstructed, or they're lied to, and they know it, you know, because people have a lot of common sense, and so then they start to ask more questions, and so what used to be me running around investigating is
[01:24:27.635 --> 01:24:53.236]  Thousands of people doing very much the same thing that I was doing and they're uncovering a lot of stuff and it's just starting to well up and come out and you ain't seen nothing yet because I think as we go into the next year or two as citizens start to say okay I can do this I can go out you know and I can ask some questions and I can get some records and I can find some things out for myself we're going to learn things that we don't really want to know
[01:24:54.514 --> 01:25:13.019]  Well, Bev, you've just said on the psychology here, it is painful, it is scary, it is nauseating to imagine that there is concerted election fraud to take the people's will and destroy this free country.
[01:25:13.739 --> 01:25:14.720]  But it's really happening.
[01:25:14.780 --> 01:25:21.485]  I mean, knowing what I know about election fraud, knowing what you know, Americans should be out on the streets by the millions freaking out.
[01:25:21.966 --> 01:25:25.528]  But you're right, people are starting to more and more get involved.
[01:25:25.548 --> 01:25:30.352]  We have a huge movement here in Austin, Texas, huge movements in Kansas City, all over the place that we're on the radio.
[01:25:32.401 --> 01:25:39.386]  I mean just a few months ago I saw that clip and it was in a legislature where the you know insiders getting up and saying he was hired to design the machines for fraud.
[01:25:39.406 --> 01:25:42.168]  Can you go over some of the whistleblowers we've seen the last year?
[01:25:42.569 --> 01:25:49.374]  Oh yeah, I mean they're coming out of the woodwork and there was a question, I think you're probably referring to Clint Curtis.
[01:25:50.120 --> 01:26:05.627]  And he was, he says that he was told by, it's not Tom DeLay, it's Tom Feeney, down in Florida, he was told to create a program to manipulate a machine.
[01:26:06.488 --> 01:26:13.271]  We know that a particular programmer up in Canada put in backdoors into
[01:26:14.249 --> 01:26:15.550]  The Diebold touchscreen system.
[01:26:16.211 --> 01:26:17.091]  It wasn't a glitch.
[01:26:17.131 --> 01:26:18.473]  It wasn't a programming error.
[01:26:18.533 --> 01:26:20.134]  He put several levels of them.
[01:26:20.154 --> 01:26:22.356]  It was fairly elegant how it was done.
[01:26:24.077 --> 01:26:28.301]  More and more people are coming out and telling what they know.
[01:26:29.362 --> 01:26:32.644]  And I think, of course, now it's compartmentalized.
[01:26:32.704 --> 01:26:35.867]  It's not like just because you work for a company, you're going to know all about this stuff.
[01:26:36.588 --> 01:26:41.612]  What we found, for example, in the Diebold system is there's really only a few people who actually know how it works.
[01:26:42.130 --> 01:26:42.450]  Thank you.
[01:27:00.524 --> 01:27:01.244]  Undeniable.
[01:27:01.465 --> 01:27:17.454]  Now, people getting up in legislatures and saying, I was hired by this person, or getting up in court and saying, and showing the documentation, that should be ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox, nightly top head story, but it's not, is it, Beth?
[01:27:17.514 --> 01:27:29.621]  No, I can tell you there are, you know, of course, people have seen Lou Dobbs has been lobbying one over the net every single night, and I do think his producers realize how big a story it is, and how
[01:27:30.199 --> 01:27:33.760]  How hard it is for the American public to actually face this.
[01:27:34.120 --> 01:27:38.561]  You know, because what people do when they're so scared of certain kinds of news is they turn away.
[01:27:39.001 --> 01:27:43.863]  I think a lot of people will remember the AIDS crisis when it first broke in the early 80s.
[01:27:44.263 --> 01:27:48.884]  A lot of people didn't want to hear it, didn't want to know it, didn't want to know anything about it because it was scary.
[01:27:49.504 --> 01:27:59.567]  And so I think we're at a stage now of pushing the story out the door day after day in different specifics so that people can get their head around it.
[01:28:00.276 --> 01:28:06.961]  And start going, okay, it is real, and I gotta start accepting it, and I have to be willing to look.
[01:28:07.041 --> 01:28:16.449]  That's the first step for most people, because when you really can look, and you really see it, you no longer have the luxury of just sitting around and hoping someone takes care of it.
[01:28:16.469 --> 01:28:18.590]  It makes you get out of your chair and do something.
[01:28:18.971 --> 01:28:20.071]  And, you know, there's that, too.
[01:28:20.091 --> 01:28:22.994]  People go, well, if I really get into this, then I have to do something.
[01:28:23.014 --> 01:28:28.378]  Well, I mean, does any American out there feel safe?
[01:28:29.349 --> 01:28:34.250]  In any way, knowing that there's a criminal group and groups openly stealing elections?
[01:28:34.310 --> 01:28:38.151]  I mean, an organized fraud against our republic?
[01:28:38.171 --> 01:28:38.771]  This is huge.
[01:28:39.151 --> 01:28:42.172]  Bev, let's talk about who the enemy is when we get back.
[01:28:43.792 --> 01:28:44.693]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.193 --> 01:28:46.793]  The empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.713 --> 01:28:50.374]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:54.116 --> 01:28:56.458]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here with an important question.
[01:28:56.698 --> 01:28:58.740]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[01:28:58.880 --> 01:29:05.925]  I mean real hard to find all natural pure soap that contains no dyes, perfumes, deodorants, detergents, or other dangerous toxins.
[01:29:06.205 --> 01:29:14.732]  The Calvin Pure Soap Company, for the past 57 years, has been making triple concentrated pure soaps exclusively for healthcare professionals and hospitals.
[01:29:15.112 --> 01:29:19.796]  Now for the first time, Calvin Pure Soap is available factory direct to you and your family.
[01:29:19.936 --> 01:29:26.622]  That's great news because Calvin Pure Soap is made from all natural ingredients, is earth friendly, and completely environmentally safe.
[01:29:26.782 --> 01:29:31.126]  So if you want yesterday's values today for good old-fashioned pure soap, call 1-800-340-7091.
[01:29:34.529 --> 01:29:38.071]  Save up to 85% off supermarket and retail store prices.
[01:29:38.251 --> 01:29:40.712]  Call today for a Calbin Soap Catalog at 1-800-340-7091.
[01:29:40.732 --> 01:29:42.093]  That's 1-800-340-7091 or on the web at CalbinPureSoap.com.
[01:29:42.113 --> 01:29:44.474]  Try Pure Soap once and I'll guarantee you'll never use anything else.
[01:29:53.766 --> 01:29:58.991]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[01:29:59.131 --> 01:30:07.220]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[01:30:07.480 --> 01:30:14.547]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[01:30:14.707 --> 01:30:21.973]  Radioactive Poisoning Potassium Iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[01:30:22.153 --> 01:30:27.257]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[01:30:27.357 --> 01:30:36.225]  Potassium Iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[01:30:36.505 --> 01:30:39.807]  Order the official Potassium Iodate for only $24 and save $5.
[01:30:41.889 --> 01:30:42.230]  We're good.
[01:30:54.478 --> 01:30:55.298]  Come on, Bill.
[01:30:55.518 --> 01:31:00.702]  Two weeks ago you were riding a bicycle, and today you're showing up in your new car and telling me you're buying a house?
[01:31:01.042 --> 01:31:02.543]  What did you do, rob Bill Gates?
[01:31:02.624 --> 01:31:04.605]  No, John, I didn't rob Bill Gates.
[01:31:04.885 --> 01:31:10.409]  What I did do is visit the website www.DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[01:31:10.689 --> 01:31:16.954]  That's where I learn how to make $3,000 to $9,000 each and every week, starting with my very first week.
[01:31:17.294 --> 01:31:19.476]  It's a simple program that does all the work for you.
[01:31:19.736 --> 01:31:23.180]  I'm already up to $25,000 just going on my third week!
[01:31:23.441 --> 01:31:23.861]  Whoa!
[01:31:24.242 --> 01:31:25.423]  What was that website again?
[01:31:25.523 --> 01:31:29.008]  It's www.DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[01:31:29.308 --> 01:31:30.429]  Now write this down, John.
[01:31:30.569 --> 01:31:34.855]  You should go there and learn how this program can help you become financially independent, too.
[01:31:35.015 --> 01:31:35.596]  Thanks, Bill.
[01:31:35.876 --> 01:31:37.077]  I'm going there right now.
[01:31:37.478 --> 01:31:38.119]  Check, please!
[01:31:39.906 --> 01:31:41.347]  Uh, you got this one, right Bill?
[01:31:41.828 --> 01:31:42.429]  Sure, John.
[01:31:42.649 --> 01:31:47.015]  Don't forget, it's www.DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[01:31:47.315 --> 01:31:48.997]  Next time, you'll be buying me lunch.
[01:31:49.177 --> 01:31:49.458]  Deal?
[01:32:11.480 --> 01:32:15.905]  The Globalists are openly announcing that they plan to attack Iran very soon.
[01:32:15.925 --> 01:32:21.431]  The Federal Government's coming out and saying there might have been bombs in Building 7.
[01:32:21.932 --> 01:32:22.392]  Hmm.
[01:32:23.473 --> 01:32:24.455]  They're going to look into that.
[01:32:24.475 --> 01:32:25.716]  I'm sure they'll lie to us.
[01:32:26.217 --> 01:32:28.259]  But the mere fact we're having to respond is huge.
[01:32:29.128 --> 01:32:38.253]  But election fraud, doesn't it go hand-in-hand with the Supreme Court saying private interest can openly lobby, that is pay off, local governments and take your land without just compensation?
[01:32:38.593 --> 01:32:40.474]  It fits in with plans for a national draft.
[01:32:40.494 --> 01:32:42.395]  It fits in with the North American Union.
[01:32:42.935 --> 01:32:46.017]  By the way, everything that Lou Dobbs is covering, by the way, I checked into his contract.
[01:32:46.037 --> 01:32:48.598]  He's one of the few at CNN who's allowed to do whatever he wants.
[01:32:49.118 --> 01:32:50.459]  Has total editorial control.
[01:32:50.479 --> 01:32:52.400]  That was his deal to come back to CNN.
[01:32:52.420 --> 01:32:54.041]  Remember, he left for a few years.
[01:32:54.992 --> 01:32:55.812]  To run his own company.
[01:32:56.272 --> 01:32:59.493]  So yeah, we have to commend Lou Dobbs, but this stuff's all going on.
[01:33:00.333 --> 01:33:14.596]  And it is premeditated, it is focused, and it's just the arrogant system saying, hey, we put these computers in, we put these systems in here, we run things, try to vote us out, and they literally will laugh at you.
[01:33:16.476 --> 01:33:18.617]  Evil people have taken control of the government.
[01:33:19.217 --> 01:33:21.097]  There's big money in controlling government.
[01:33:21.856 --> 01:33:23.356]  And corruption is going to see.
[01:33:23.396 --> 01:33:25.477]  Beth Harris, before we go any further, you haven't given it out yet.
[01:33:25.837 --> 01:33:29.558]  Tell us about the website, the organization, how folks can support you, your book.
[01:33:30.178 --> 01:33:30.398]  Right.
[01:33:30.678 --> 01:33:32.518]  Well, the book isn't as big a deal anymore.
[01:33:32.598 --> 01:33:34.319]  Right now it's action.
[01:33:34.819 --> 01:33:38.459]  And so the website is blackboxvoting.org.
[01:33:38.479 --> 01:33:39.300]  Okay?
[01:33:39.360 --> 01:33:42.640]  Inside a black box means you can't see inside the voting machine.
[01:33:42.660 --> 01:33:44.781]  That's why we call them Black Box Voting Machine.
[01:33:45.041 --> 01:33:46.481]  So it's blackboxvoting.org.
[01:33:46.581 --> 01:33:47.461]  It's a non-profit.
[01:33:48.321 --> 01:33:50.262]  And obviously we
[01:33:51.121 --> 01:33:53.322]  It exists only because of citizen donations.
[01:33:53.883 --> 01:33:56.424]  We don't take money from any vested interest.
[01:33:56.604 --> 01:34:00.627]  We don't take money from any of these corporations or voting machine vendors or any of that.
[01:34:00.747 --> 01:34:01.207]  Only citizens.
[01:34:01.627 --> 01:34:14.055]  Now, what we'd like to see citizens doing, what I did was I've been out on the road for like three years looking into this stuff and I did kind of a brain dump of everything I've learned in three years and I put it down and I call it a toolkit.
[01:34:14.855 --> 01:34:16.416]  And it's very easy to use.
[01:34:16.857 --> 01:34:20.519]  It's got 20 different modules so you can pick things that interest you
[01:34:21.038 --> 01:34:23.339]  Because people have very different skill sets, right?
[01:34:23.819 --> 01:34:27.441]  And each module is only about three, four pages long.
[01:34:27.461 --> 01:34:28.262]  Just bullet points.
[01:34:28.422 --> 01:34:29.662]  Just, you know, this, this, and this.
[01:34:29.682 --> 01:34:33.484]  Because I know you've got common sense and you can figure these things out.
[01:34:33.684 --> 01:34:35.085]  And if not, you can ask me.
[01:34:35.365 --> 01:34:38.507]  But what I did was, it's another book, frankly.
[01:34:38.547 --> 01:34:41.068]  It's 129 pages long with all 20 modules.
[01:34:41.108 --> 01:34:42.208]  And I've got two more to go.
[01:34:42.809 --> 01:34:49.212]  But it's a live book because we're updating it constantly with stuff that citizens are finding that works to oversee their government.
[01:34:50.109 --> 01:34:51.310]  We put it on there for free.
[01:34:51.370 --> 01:34:52.330]  It's right up at the top.
[01:34:52.610 --> 01:34:57.713]  We've got a national hand count registry because we do have some counties now that are starting to say, you know what?
[01:34:58.373 --> 01:35:03.916]  Maybe we will take another look at hand counted paper ballots because this is turning into such a mess.
[01:35:05.348 --> 01:35:22.787]  So folks can go to blackboxvoting.org and really get a huge synopsis, a hundred plus page synopsis, with different sectors, different areas, with bullet points, with tactics that work, and it's important to understand that
[01:35:23.562 --> 01:35:48.488]  We've proven they're stealing elections coast-to-coast by design, but if you can just prove in your county to the voters and the citizenry, and by going every week to the City Council and talking on televised cable, you know, getting the word out, that it is fraud-based, and that there has been fraud, and that it's open to hacking, if you can just prove that it can be scammed, then you can demand that it be removed.
[01:35:48.548 --> 01:35:49.149]  Right, Bev?
[01:35:49.569 --> 01:35:50.849]  Right, and the thing is,
[01:35:51.804 --> 01:35:53.486]  It really is local.
[01:35:54.086 --> 01:35:57.509]  A federal election is just 10,000 local races.
[01:35:58.910 --> 01:35:59.330]  Literally.
[01:36:00.171 --> 01:36:05.075]  It's all the local jurisdictions put together and we don't yet have it federalized.
[01:36:05.436 --> 01:36:06.797]  Now they're trying that way.
[01:36:06.957 --> 01:36:14.163]  They've got some states, Texas is not one of them, but there are several states now where the states have taken it over from the local people.
[01:36:14.983 --> 01:36:20.145]  But even then, if you get in there and you say, I mean, you don't even have to go to all the meetings.
[01:36:20.565 --> 01:36:23.486]  It's amazing all the different things you can do that really make a difference.
[01:36:23.926 --> 01:36:25.966]  But what you do need to do is get real evidence.
[01:36:26.006 --> 01:36:32.168]  And by real evidence, I mean, wherever you go, take a video camera or a little audio, pocket audio recorder.
[01:36:32.188 --> 01:36:35.049]  You know, in Texas, you can secretly tape record public officials.
[01:36:35.409 --> 01:36:41.091]  And so you can ask them all kinds of leading questions and get them on tape, telling you these ridiculous answers they come up with.
[01:36:41.897 --> 01:36:47.099]  It doesn't mean anything if you come tell somebody, or even if you sign an affidavit, but you need evidence.
[01:36:47.159 --> 01:36:53.621]  And evidence is videotape, audio recordings, photographs, public records.
[01:36:54.161 --> 01:36:55.722]  Something that stands up in court.
[01:36:56.482 --> 01:36:59.843]  Whether or not you have to go to court, you find that once you get the goods,
[01:37:00.676 --> 01:37:06.259]  You do get media coverage on it, because it's safe for the media to cover a video tape.
[01:37:06.399 --> 01:37:15.643]  The only problem is, and it is good to get coverage, they always say, another problem was discovered, another screw up, and then it's a guy testifying he was hired to run frauds.
[01:37:15.723 --> 01:37:18.105]  No, it isn't another problem was discovered.
[01:37:18.405 --> 01:37:20.466]  I mean, Bev, I've seen that a million times.
[01:37:21.646 --> 01:37:25.048]  And what it is, I want people to remember back to the days of Watergate.
[01:37:26.029 --> 01:37:32.193]  This is bigger than Watergate, but let's think back to how Watergate finally got past the tipping point.
[01:37:32.573 --> 01:37:38.517]  It didn't start out, well, we have obstruction of justice by the President of the United States, which was where it ended.
[01:37:38.977 --> 01:37:48.644]  What it started out is, well, you know, a check ran through the account of some guy and somehow it ended up going to Cuba, we can't figure that out, you know, or it went through a Mexican account.
[01:37:48.684 --> 01:37:53.807]  They had little bitty pieces of evidence, one after the next, after the next,
[01:37:54.668 --> 01:37:58.711]  And over time, people went, okay, we're seeing a bigger and bigger picture.
[01:37:58.731 --> 01:38:01.013]  They were able to emotionally handle it.
[01:38:01.853 --> 01:38:08.538]  And yes, it ended up a president resigned because the president was obstructing justice.
[01:38:08.558 --> 01:38:15.443]  And you're going to get at that by finding individual pieces of evidence and compiling them together.
[01:38:15.603 --> 01:38:17.545]  Same thing happened with the tobacco industry.
[01:38:17.565 --> 01:38:21.848]  As you recall, it used to be the tobacco industry never lost a lawsuit.
[01:38:22.504 --> 01:38:27.210]  And anybody who went up against him was really in trouble and had real problems.
[01:38:27.751 --> 01:38:35.881]  But they started doing one case after the next, here and there, and compiling evidence, putting it all together, and finally they had the whole ball of wax.
[01:38:36.242 --> 01:38:36.702]  Exactly.
[01:38:36.762 --> 01:38:40.988]  Big tobacco would send squads out to rough you up or break into your house.
[01:38:41.653 --> 01:38:46.216]  And that got covered in that great film, I forget the name, based on... The Insider, I think it was.
[01:38:46.236 --> 01:38:47.676]  Yeah, The Insider with Russell Crowe.
[01:38:47.716 --> 01:38:48.997]  Great film based on her story.
[01:38:49.758 --> 01:38:51.278]  But that was the point.
[01:38:51.458 --> 01:38:55.621]  Once it was tens of thousands of people going public, they couldn't go rough up everybody.
[01:38:56.121 --> 01:38:56.361]  Right.
[01:38:56.681 --> 01:39:03.065]  And that's why we are going, it is going to be up to the people of the United States to make the case.
[01:39:03.205 --> 01:39:08.748]  This is not going to get dealt with by our public officials until the people make the case.
[01:39:09.269 --> 01:39:11.892]  Because the public officials were put in there by this system.
[01:39:11.912 --> 01:39:14.796]  You can't use a broken system to fix itself.
[01:39:14.896 --> 01:39:20.082]  You mean if I catch a fox in my henhouse, I can't hire it to guard the henhouse?
[01:39:20.643 --> 01:39:20.863]  No!
[01:39:20.903 --> 01:39:21.684]  Isn't it a surprise?
[01:39:21.984 --> 01:39:23.886]  And that's why we put together the toolkit.
[01:39:23.926 --> 01:39:28.392]  Because, okay, we don't want everybody to have to reinvent the wheel.
[01:39:28.920 --> 01:39:30.321]  And it gives a lot of good ideas.
[01:39:30.401 --> 01:39:38.506]  And what I'm finding is that citizens have, we only put this toolkit out a couple of weeks ago, and citizens all over the country are using it and getting results.
[01:39:38.746 --> 01:39:43.349]  Sure, I want to talk more about solutions and that toolkit, but you mentioned a great victory.
[01:39:43.369 --> 01:39:48.872]  You mentioned that some towns and cities are withdrawing from these fraud-based machines and going back to paper ballots.
[01:39:49.313 --> 01:39:57.718]  I also know that a bunch of states are saying no to the Help America Vote Act, the six billion bucks or whatever it is, to come in and pay
[01:39:58.664 --> 01:40:02.867]  The local counties to put in these scam-based systems.
[01:40:02.887 --> 01:40:06.029]  So can you run over those victories and give us some of the other victories?
[01:40:06.409 --> 01:40:06.830]  Well, yeah.
[01:40:06.850 --> 01:40:13.014]  The state of New Hampshire, about 45% of their locations are going to do hand-counted paper ballots this fall.
[01:40:13.494 --> 01:40:23.521]  There is a county in California that has said, you know what, we're going to buy our own scanner and we're going to scan all the ballots and put them on the internet ourselves.
[01:40:23.721 --> 01:40:26.022]  And the state of California kind of didn't want them to do that.
[01:40:26.062 --> 01:40:28.144]  They said, well, then we're just going to do it anyway.
[01:40:29.155 --> 01:40:37.022]  We have another county in California that said, you know what, we're required to use these machines, but we're going to let you guys come in and count them at the precinct anyway.
[01:40:37.903 --> 01:40:40.225]  I mean, you know, this is the places with the paper ballots.
[01:40:40.245 --> 01:40:49.072]  The State of New York said, you know what, the Department of Justice has taken the State of New York to court because the State of New York refused to buy the new voting machines.
[01:40:49.673 --> 01:40:52.495]  The State of Connecticut decided to delay it for a year.
[01:40:52.855 --> 01:40:54.737]  So, you know, we are seeing people
[01:40:55.612 --> 01:40:56.813]  Stiffen up their spines.
[01:40:57.153 --> 01:41:03.718]  Isn't Arkansas... You've got to have lots of citizens really on their case.
[01:41:03.918 --> 01:41:05.859]  Isn't Arkansas also pulling out of it?
[01:41:07.980 --> 01:41:09.021]  Well, that's news to me.
[01:41:09.081 --> 01:41:11.423]  If Arkansas is, I didn't know that.
[01:41:12.183 --> 01:41:21.570]  Well, I knew it was probably six months ago I read some mainstream news articles out of Arkansas where a bunch of their counties were saying no to the Help America Vote Act.
[01:41:22.731 --> 01:41:24.573]  Oh, well, I'll have to go back and research that.
[01:41:24.873 --> 01:41:30.419]  The thing is, yes, we are finding that there are public officials who have backbone.
[01:41:30.559 --> 01:41:32.921]  It takes a lot of backbone for them right now.
[01:41:32.981 --> 01:41:35.163]  And I've got to say, there's some real heroes there.
[01:41:36.585 --> 01:41:37.586]  Real heroes.
[01:41:37.646 --> 01:41:40.068]  Yeah, what happened in South Texas?
[01:41:40.889 --> 01:41:42.991]  You guys were down here and really hit a home run.
[01:41:44.034 --> 01:41:44.955]  In South Texas.
[01:41:44.975 --> 01:41:47.737]  Well, actually, no, in Utah that was, I believe.
[01:41:48.018 --> 01:41:55.124]  No, but there was another case where you guys went down and tested the machines in Texas, and then it, uh, you hacked them right there on the spot.
[01:41:55.304 --> 01:41:58.507]  Oh, that was, no, that was Leon County, uh, but that was actually Florida.
[01:41:58.927 --> 01:42:00.769]  But, yeah, we did hack them on the spot.
[01:42:01.469 --> 01:42:03.191]  Um... There must have been another voting group.
[01:42:06.417 --> 01:42:07.518]  See, that's the good news, Bev.
[01:42:07.558 --> 01:42:15.423]  If you've got 13,000 counties, and as you've said, a whole bunch of Bev Harris's, that you've spawned now, thank God, that's the problem.
[01:42:15.443 --> 01:42:21.787]  There's so much of this news, and this fight, there's so many articles about it, none of us know even probably 20% of it.
[01:42:22.647 --> 01:42:23.548]  Actually, that's true.
[01:42:23.808 --> 01:42:34.675]  Nobody now, it's gotten so big that not even the news sites that specialize in this topic, Bradblog is one of those, you know, every day it puts out a new story, he can't even keep up with it all.
[01:42:35.071 --> 01:42:43.217]  That actually is a good thing though because we're not going to quit this beast unless we have a tremendous amount of effort.
[01:42:43.657 --> 01:42:49.601]  Think of it as a pendulum, a big heavy pendulum that's swinging toward taking power away from the people.
[01:42:49.881 --> 01:42:56.025]  The only way you can get it back is to slow it down and then reverse it so that we start taking back power.
[01:42:56.065 --> 01:42:57.046]  That is going to take a
[01:42:57.466 --> 01:42:59.748]  Huge amount of effort from everyone.
[01:42:59.928 --> 01:43:01.950]  And let me be clear, I've been studying that pendulum.
[01:43:02.270 --> 01:43:06.834]  It was swinging hard with incredible force towards totally crushing the Republic.
[01:43:07.155 --> 01:43:11.538]  It's still swinging towards us, but we are actually slowing it down now.
[01:43:12.639 --> 01:43:14.801]  Yes, that's exactly accurate.
[01:43:15.422 --> 01:43:24.590]  And the thing that was so scary is for a long time, I know that you've been on this for a long time, but very few people even knew it was swinging.
[01:43:25.183 --> 01:43:29.865]  And it really, truly isn't a situation where you go, aha, we've won the thing.
[01:43:30.226 --> 01:43:32.187]  It will always swing back and forth.
[01:43:32.227 --> 01:43:35.128]  It's like good and evil, because it is good and evil.
[01:43:35.368 --> 01:43:36.909]  But our job now is very clear.
[01:43:36.949 --> 01:43:42.092]  Our job is to reverse the swing of the pendulum and start putting it back into the hands of the people.
[01:43:42.112 --> 01:43:44.593]  Bev, I want to take some calls, but I want to bring up this point.
[01:43:45.606 --> 01:43:49.949]  The hubris of the elite trying to put in a unified national fraud system.
[01:43:49.989 --> 01:43:53.491]  We know there was already a lot of fraud even with the scam systems before.
[01:43:54.132 --> 01:44:08.301]  It seems to me now they've overreached trying to unify federally the scam with just four or five companies and so that when they reach for it all that they may have started the chain reaction that's going to backfire and have the whole thing blow up in their face.
[01:44:08.521 --> 01:44:11.143]  Which is often how it happens is from overreaching.
[01:44:11.403 --> 01:44:13.545]  That's how it happens so often.
[01:44:13.565 --> 01:44:14.345]  They get arrogant.
[01:44:14.585 --> 01:44:15.286]  They overreach.
[01:44:15.942 --> 01:44:16.942]  And then people wake up.
[01:44:17.202 --> 01:44:18.383]  Same thing with embezzlers.
[01:44:18.883 --> 01:44:19.103]  Right.
[01:44:20.103 --> 01:44:21.184]  I know you're an expert in that.
[01:44:21.204 --> 01:44:23.204]  I mean, that's how the criminal mind works.
[01:44:23.384 --> 01:44:28.706]  The criminal mind is really, it's cunning to a certain extent, but also stupid in ways, isn't it?
[01:44:29.086 --> 01:44:30.166]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:44:30.246 --> 01:44:33.367]  And we've got to hope that they stay stupid long enough for us to get it back.
[01:44:36.028 --> 01:44:44.151]  Because the scariest thing is, you know, if you just do some action, but not enough action, you can actually inoculate it.
[01:44:44.491 --> 01:44:45.351]  You can actually be like,
[01:44:46.908 --> 01:44:49.470]  You just give it more resistance the next time around.
[01:44:49.871 --> 01:44:57.858]  So we have to really do a knockout blow here, in a way, where we've got to really get out there in the next, every election until we get it back.
[01:44:58.138 --> 01:45:00.580]  And we've got to have the biggest citizen evidence gathering
[01:45:03.917 --> 01:45:07.581]  Well, Bev, Americans don't really talk to each other anymore, though.
[01:45:07.621 --> 01:45:08.522]  That's starting to change.
[01:45:09.183 --> 01:45:14.769]  I mean, this is the type of issue where you should be knocking on every door on your block saying, hey, can I invite you over for coffee?
[01:45:14.809 --> 01:45:18.693]  I've got some nice little printouts here, some news articles about election fraud.
[01:45:18.713 --> 01:45:24.720]  And if your neighbor says, well, I don't, you know, I'm busy, go, hey, this is America, the United States!
[01:45:25.160 --> 01:45:26.661]  We're losing our right to vote!
[01:45:26.741 --> 01:45:30.523]  Do you understand what it means if a group can block us from voting?
[01:45:30.603 --> 01:45:33.805]  It means big corporations are going to rake the daylights out of you!
[01:45:34.145 --> 01:45:35.446]  This is serious!
[01:45:36.107 --> 01:45:45.392]  And you know, one of the first things we have in the toolkit, which again, it's right on the website, blackboxvoting.org, available for free download, but one of the first modules is a house party module.
[01:45:45.592 --> 01:45:50.395]  Here's how you get your neighbors involved, here's how you set up a house party, is what you do.
[01:45:50.974 --> 01:45:52.956]  Um, and you can use your own creativity.
[01:45:53.257 --> 01:45:55.800]  I was mentioning some of the other victories that have happened.
[01:45:55.820 --> 01:46:00.305]  There is a group in Memphis that has got a temporary restraining order and locked down the voting machines.
[01:46:00.625 --> 01:46:00.905]  Good!
[01:46:00.945 --> 01:46:04.069]  I mean, this is the kind of thing citizens can actually get accomplished.
[01:46:04.309 --> 01:46:07.693]  There are groups out there that are convening their own citizens grand juries.
[01:46:08.354 --> 01:46:12.038]  I mean, it can work, but we have to be confident.
[01:46:12.138 --> 01:46:15.341]  We can't have this inferiority complex that we can't do it because we can't.
[01:46:15.542 --> 01:46:17.504]  You just took the words right out of my mouth.
[01:46:17.524 --> 01:46:20.727]  I mean, I guess revels come from the same cloth.
[01:46:21.307 --> 01:46:27.013]  Number one, we, the establishment, going back, I remember being involved in elections 12, 13, 14 years ago.
[01:46:29.475 --> 01:46:33.956]  In fact, I got into politics first before I got into TV and radio, so that's fourteen years ago now.
[01:46:34.637 --> 01:46:54.222]  I remember working on campaigns, seeing it happen, being and then volunteering to be in there, stacking the Scantrons, getting them ready to jam into the machines, and seeing, here's an example, half the votes in Travis County in the Republican primary for Pat Buchanan, and I was talking to other tables, I was saying, hey, are you seeing what I'm seeing?
[01:46:54.702 --> 01:46:56.923]  Wow, looks like Pat's going to win.
[01:46:56.943 --> 01:47:02.305]  And then suddenly, the night comes out and he got like 5% or something.
[01:47:02.766 --> 01:47:10.849]  You know, folks, just when you see the fraud for yourself, and so we go talk to election officials, they laugh at us.
[01:47:11.269 --> 01:47:15.191]  And because of Bev and others out there, they don't laugh anymore, they run in fear.
[01:47:15.511 --> 01:47:17.712]  These scammers know we're on to them, don't they, Bev?
[01:47:18.052 --> 01:47:18.992]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:47:19.852 --> 01:47:20.293]  And they do.
[01:47:20.313 --> 01:47:21.293]  It's not funny.
[01:47:21.333 --> 01:47:27.614]  I walk into an elections office and all of a sudden their face changes, their whole demeanor changes, and they start to get really nervous.
[01:47:27.654 --> 01:47:36.636]  And I don't try to do that, because actually there are a lot of good election officials who have been railroaded along, but there are some... Sure, it's like Darth Vader just aborted the spacecraft.
[01:47:36.716 --> 01:47:39.097]  Well, you know, and we have a lot...
[01:47:39.397 --> 01:47:44.018]  It's surprising how many election officials actually work with black box voting behind the scenes.
[01:47:44.038 --> 01:47:44.818]  Sure, that's how it works.
[01:47:44.858 --> 01:47:46.278]  They're not allowed to look under the hood.
[01:47:46.498 --> 01:47:47.899]  They're not allowed to touch anything.
[01:47:48.179 --> 01:47:50.019]  I mean, you know, they're told, just shut up.
[01:47:50.039 --> 01:47:51.119]  This is how it works, too.
[01:47:51.459 --> 01:47:51.960]  Right, right.
[01:47:52.340 --> 01:48:00.161]  So, it is... And we're seeing more of that, but we're also seeing election officials really get punished by the establishment.
[01:48:00.181 --> 01:48:06.663]  So, you know, citizens... Actually, I think the local election official, in many cases, is really between a rock and a hard place.
[01:48:07.463 --> 01:48:08.443]  Because they are...
[01:48:09.776 --> 01:48:15.260]  Really almost pushed out of office if they try to... Well, hey, that's what it takes.
[01:48:15.280 --> 01:48:22.246]  They need to create a union of, say, you know, county clerks, election officials, for a free and fair vote.
[01:48:22.826 --> 01:48:24.787]  And they need to start having, you know, conventions.
[01:48:24.908 --> 01:48:25.488]  Right, they do.
[01:48:25.628 --> 01:48:31.973]  And in fact, Ayn Sancho, who's this great election official, the first one to allow us to hack the machines in Florida,
[01:48:33.198 --> 01:48:40.783]  I provided him with a number of names and contact information for other election officials who quietly came to us and were very disturbed about things.
[01:48:41.744 --> 01:48:52.330]  But, you know, I and Diebold tried to run him out of office and actually that escalated all the way up to an antitrust investigation by the Florida Attorney General.
[01:48:52.890 --> 01:48:59.214]  In Utah, I hadn't actually prevailed there, but in Utah, the official there, Bruce Funk,
[01:48:59.975 --> 01:49:01.556]  Uh, was treated very badly.
[01:49:01.616 --> 01:49:04.617]  They put, um, he allowed an examination of the machine.
[01:49:04.697 --> 01:49:06.477]  It uncovered a huge security flaw.
[01:49:06.537 --> 01:49:08.018]  It was covered in the New York Times.
[01:49:08.578 --> 01:49:24.544]  And yet, Diebold lawyers were flown to Emory County, Utah, on the gov- on the Lieutenant Governor's jet, and they came into closed session and locked an elected official out of his office, and he has not been able to get back into him.
[01:49:25.450 --> 01:49:26.651]  Yeah, that's how America works.
[01:49:26.671 --> 01:49:31.453]  Selected officials blow the whistle and private corporations lock them out of the government building.
[01:49:32.033 --> 01:49:33.234]  It's called tyranny.
[01:49:33.274 --> 01:49:41.478]  That's why they're militarizing the police, handing out black masks that criminals have always worn, inquisitors have always worn, executioners have always worn.
[01:49:41.978 --> 01:49:47.300]  When the black masks start going on, folks, you know you're in downtown Moscow.
[01:49:47.641 --> 01:49:48.621]  We'll be right back.
[01:49:48.661 --> 01:49:49.361]  They want to fight?
[01:49:49.681 --> 01:49:50.582]  They're gonna get it!
[01:49:56.622 --> 01:49:57.123]  It's here!
[01:49:57.343 --> 01:50:02.127]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:50:02.487 --> 01:50:10.153]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:50:10.834 --> 01:50:17.879]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:50:18.279 --> 01:50:25.145]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying,
[01:50:25.652 --> 01:50:29.715]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:50:29.996 --> 01:50:33.518]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:50:33.979 --> 01:50:35.880]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:50:36.221 --> 01:50:40.124]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:52:59.006 --> 01:53:03.189]  Let's take a call for Bev Harris.
[01:53:03.469 --> 01:53:10.892]  Ed in Pennsylvania, you're on the air with this modern American hero, a great lady, Bev Harris of blackboxvoting.org.
[01:53:10.932 --> 01:53:11.473]  Go ahead, Ed.
[01:53:12.733 --> 01:53:13.554]  Hi, Alex.
[01:53:13.674 --> 01:53:15.235]  I have actually two questions for Bev.
[01:53:16.635 --> 01:53:26.060]  First is, I was wondering if there's any running list someplace of the specific people who are responsible making the decisions to implement the machine?
[01:53:27.566 --> 01:53:28.707]  You know, that's a good question.
[01:53:28.747 --> 01:53:37.072]  We really were looking at doing that, but we did have a list at one point called the Gotta Be Replaced list.
[01:53:40.734 --> 01:53:43.355]  It is the same old characters to a great degree.
[01:53:43.415 --> 01:53:50.579]  There are some new names that come in, but I don't have a one-shot place for that right now.
[01:53:50.659 --> 01:53:51.680]  That's a great idea.
[01:53:51.740 --> 01:53:56.723]  That would be a really good communications tool that would hold people's toes to the fire for their decisions they've made.
[01:53:57.429 --> 01:53:57.669]  Right.
[01:53:58.349 --> 01:54:03.832]  Basically, if you look at the big four electronic voting machine companies, I've studied them.
[01:54:03.852 --> 01:54:09.814]  Diebold looks like an intelligence operation, a government operation, the way they, you know, the things they do.
[01:54:10.335 --> 01:54:18.718]  And the others are owned by senators, are owned by defense contractors, are owned by groups that shouldn't even be involved, you know, anywhere near the voting process.
[01:54:21.379 --> 01:54:23.240]  They're all basically designed the same.
[01:54:23.480 --> 01:54:25.701]  You're not allowed to look under... I mean, here's a parallel.
[01:54:25.781 --> 01:54:35.985]  In Texas, the state legislature is not allowed to see the agreements with the private Spanish company, Centra, that's taking over 8,000 miles, almost all of our state highways and local roads.
[01:54:36.605 --> 01:54:39.206]  And they tell the legislature, no, you're not allowed to see any of it.
[01:54:39.226 --> 01:54:39.987]  It's a private agreement.
[01:54:40.267 --> 01:54:42.928]  Of course, it's a total fraud, but it's the same thing with these.
[01:54:43.028 --> 01:54:46.329]  Well, and it's also government officials, for example.
[01:54:46.349 --> 01:54:48.270]  And I think he may be looking at...
[01:54:48.635 --> 01:55:09.368]  You've got people like Donetta Davidson who is the former Secretary of State of Colorado, Britt Williams who is the tester for Georgia and Maryland, Doug Lewis from Houston, Texas, this guy is a whole story in and of itself, they keep cropping up over and over at the top of the decision making
[01:55:14.945 --> 01:55:26.776]  I think if we ever actually get a bona fide hearing with people under oath, this is going to unravel faster than anything, because they got one in California.
[01:55:27.357 --> 01:55:32.462]  California Senator Deborah Bowen, who's the chair of the California Senate Elections Committee,
[01:55:32.873 --> 01:55:38.094]  Managed to get two of the testing labs in front of her committee, and they fell apart.
[01:55:38.434 --> 01:55:44.696]  I mean, they had ended up admitting they hadn't looked at the stuff, and they didn't understand what they were looking at.
[01:55:44.716 --> 01:55:57.019]  I think if you pull in the certifiers and the top people who've been pushing this stuff through at the public official level, and if you get them under oath, things will fall apart pretty quick.
[01:55:57.079 --> 01:55:59.740]  And it isn't as large a number of people as people might think.
[01:56:00.373 --> 01:56:01.014]  Absolutely.
[01:56:01.114 --> 01:56:08.386]  It's the same people that keep getting put to the new position and then they disband that and the same person comes over here in a new position.
[01:56:08.467 --> 01:56:09.769]  We're almost out of time here, Bev.
[01:56:09.809 --> 01:56:11.532]  Any other final questions there, Ed?
[01:56:12.942 --> 01:56:20.208]  Um, well, yeah, I was wondering, like, what would it take to get national legislation standardizing the whole procedure?
[01:56:20.349 --> 01:56:22.070]  No, no, see, that'll backfire on you.
[01:56:22.390 --> 01:56:23.551]  They're already trying that.
[01:56:23.872 --> 01:56:30.077]  After they pulled the scam in Florida, they used that with the help of the America Vote Act to come in and standardize the fraud.
[01:56:30.117 --> 01:56:30.357]  Bev?
[01:56:30.838 --> 01:56:35.582]  Yeah, you want to, the genius of democracy is in the dispersed nature of it.
[01:56:36.142 --> 01:56:40.363]  And it sounds tidier and neater and like a clean-up to do one thing, but it's dangerous.
[01:56:40.383 --> 01:56:41.343]  It's called separation of powers.
[01:56:41.423 --> 01:56:45.004]  Because all it takes then is a handful of people to derail the whole thing.
[01:56:45.464 --> 01:56:47.344]  So you actually want to have a more diverse thing.
[01:56:47.424 --> 01:56:48.825]  It's messy, but it's stable.
[01:56:49.025 --> 01:56:50.425]  Yeah, it's called separation of powers.
[01:56:50.925 --> 01:56:51.845]  Ed, thank you for the call.
[01:56:51.905 --> 01:56:58.787]  You want to have your states pass laws banning these black boxes with these modems and not letting people look under the hood.
[01:56:58.847 --> 01:56:59.567]  Ben, do you agree with that?
[01:57:00.187 --> 01:57:01.387]  Yeah, yeah, I agree with that.
[01:57:01.548 --> 01:57:03.708]  Yeah, the answer is the media is trained to solve.
[01:57:04.460 --> 01:57:05.521]  To look to the Feds.
[01:57:05.561 --> 01:57:06.781]  You look to the local area.
[01:57:07.022 --> 01:57:08.362]  That's where the authority still is.
[01:57:08.442 --> 01:57:10.144]  And possession is nine-tenths of the law.
[01:57:10.524 --> 01:57:13.626]  We have to take over the states and say no to the Feds' authority.
[01:57:13.666 --> 01:57:16.247]  The FedGov has been grabbed by private global interest.
[01:57:16.707 --> 01:57:18.529]  Beth Harris, whiteboxvoting.org.
[01:57:18.569 --> 01:57:19.969]  You keep it up as the election nears.
[01:57:20.009 --> 01:57:22.011]  I want to get you back on with more updates.
[01:57:22.051 --> 01:57:22.711]  Godspeed.
[01:57:23.071 --> 01:57:23.372]  All right.
[01:57:23.432 --> 01:57:24.072]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:57:24.332 --> 01:57:24.632]  You bet.
[01:57:24.672 --> 01:57:24.992]  Take care.
[01:57:25.013 --> 01:57:25.813]  There goes Beth Harris.
[01:57:26.053 --> 01:57:27.834]  My new film, Terror Storm, is out.

[01:57:39.916 --> 01:57:50.620]  More than... Big Brother.
[01:57:51.241 --> 01:57:52.321]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:53.021 --> 01:57:54.122]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.782 --> 01:57:55.602]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.343 --> 01:57:57.123]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.882 --> 01:58:01.625]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.086 --> 01:58:06.169]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:07.029 --> 01:58:12.434]  Alright, in this third hour, I want to get back into the big news that NIST, the federal
[01:58:13.363 --> 01:58:18.026]  Uh, you know, Scientific Investigation Group is saying they're going to look at bombs being in the buildings.
[01:58:18.046 --> 01:58:20.228]  They're saying that could be a possibility.
[01:58:20.268 --> 01:58:20.688]  It's huge.
[01:58:21.048 --> 01:58:22.009]  Israel and the U.S.
[01:58:22.049 --> 01:58:23.910]  are saying they may go ahead and attack Iran.
[01:58:24.491 --> 01:58:28.193]  Uh, things are, I mean, we're here looking at the start of World War III, trying to stop it.
[01:58:28.213 --> 01:58:29.234]  We need to focus on it.
[01:58:30.247 --> 01:58:32.808]  I'm going to take a lot of your calls in the shower.
[01:58:32.848 --> 01:58:37.589]  I've got a bunch of other news I haven't even gotten to yet that we will cover on this live Thursday edition.
[01:58:38.049 --> 01:58:41.330]  Right now, though, we are honored to be joined in studio by Stephen Conner.
[01:58:41.690 --> 01:58:44.291]  He's background, he's born and raised in the Dallas area.
[01:58:44.671 --> 01:58:49.592]  Graduated from UT Austin in 91 with a BA in Linguistics and French and a minor in Chinese.
[01:58:49.632 --> 01:58:53.133]  After graduating, went to Taiwan in 91 to study Chinese and teach English.
[01:58:53.833 --> 01:58:55.053]  And employment went to Taiwan.
[01:58:55.094 --> 01:58:58.354]  Translated computer industry periodicals for Taiwan government.
[01:58:58.695 --> 01:59:00.075]  Edited a computer industry monthly.
[01:59:00.435 --> 01:59:03.476]  Analyzed Taiwan computer industry for local bank.
[01:59:03.776 --> 01:59:08.017]  Analyzed Taiwan semiconductor industry for Hong Kong branch of major Wall Street bank.
[01:59:09.118 --> 01:59:11.138]  2001 opened Taipei branch of large U.S.
[01:59:11.178 --> 01:59:14.339]  hedge fund to gather information on Asian semiconductor companies.
[01:59:14.359 --> 01:59:15.279]  2003 resigned for position in left.
[01:59:17.720 --> 01:59:23.606]  The finance industry moved to Shanghai, China, traveled around China, has returned to Austin, Texas in 2005.
[01:59:23.886 --> 01:59:29.992]  He's a big listener, and he's opening a huge boon to freedom and liberty here in Central Texas.
[01:59:30.352 --> 01:59:34.476]  Brave new books, DVDs, discussions, and screenings.
[01:59:34.657 --> 01:59:35.277]  Great idea.
[01:59:35.658 --> 01:59:36.839]  I was going to do that here at my office.
[01:59:36.879 --> 01:59:38.060]  I never did it because I'm just too busy.
[01:59:38.080 --> 01:59:39.041]  It would become a distraction.
[01:59:39.401 --> 01:59:40.863]  So I'm glad that he's done this.
[01:59:41.503 --> 01:59:45.726]  And it's on Guadalupe Street, under Chase Bank, right downtown.
[01:59:45.946 --> 01:59:48.248]  And they've been having a soft opening this week.
[01:59:48.268 --> 01:59:50.469]  They officially open next week.
[01:59:51.030 --> 01:59:53.552]  And this is really, really exciting to have him in studio with us.
[01:59:53.572 --> 01:59:56.313]  We're going to talk about a whole host of issues and get his take on it.
[01:59:56.554 --> 01:59:59.275]  And he'll ride shotgun with us for the rest of the hour.
[01:59:59.536 --> 02:00:01.437]  So, Mr. Connor, good to have you here with us.
[02:00:01.477 --> 02:00:02.698]  I really appreciate you coming on.
[02:00:03.238 --> 02:00:05.079]  It's my pleasure to be on the show, Alex.
[02:00:05.199 --> 02:00:06.520]  It's a thrill to be here.
[02:00:07.020 --> 02:00:11.783]  You are the guy who woke me up when I was actually listening on the internet back in Shanghai.
[02:00:11.803 --> 02:00:18.767]  You know, I listened to you for about a whole year, watching all your videos, buying them, getting them for everyone else I knew.
[02:00:18.807 --> 02:00:21.009]  Are you the guy that called from town a few times when you were teaching?
[02:00:21.269 --> 02:00:21.809]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:00:21.829 --> 02:00:24.131]  So, you know, it's just incredible.
[02:00:28.931 --> 02:00:55.251]  The transformation, because before I was a heavy Democrat, I was very busy in my job back in 2001, when September 11th happened, and then the run-up into the Iraq War, but I had a background of being more of a Democrat, supporting those candidates, and when the war came, I just naturally was herded into the, if you're anti-war, then you're going to be a Dennis Kucinich, Howard Dean fan for the Democratic Party, and without doing much research, that's where I went.
[02:00:57.176 --> 02:01:03.438]  That path, you know, I was in Iowa when Dean did the scream, and he was toppled from his pedestal.
[02:01:04.058 --> 02:01:10.340]  But it didn't take long for me to realize, you know, I was very reluctant to support Kerry, but I did so.
[02:01:10.480 --> 02:01:17.482]  And then when the election returns came in in 2004, and I was watching him in Houston on Fox News, I thought, this is the setup.
[02:01:17.522 --> 02:01:20.323]  Of course I knew the 2000 elections were a complete fraud.
[02:01:20.908 --> 02:01:24.710]  But in 2004, I was hoping for better, and I was disappointed.
[02:01:24.770 --> 02:01:38.157]  And I could tell, you know, when the anchor people on Fox News were delivering the results, just very, very accurately predicting that it's going to last well into the night and we wouldn't know the results until the following day because of Ohio.
[02:01:38.737 --> 02:01:39.818]  I just knew it was a fraud.
[02:01:39.858 --> 02:01:40.718]  I knew it right there.
[02:01:40.758 --> 02:01:47.962]  And I lost my faith in certainly the mainstream portion of the Democratic Party at that time.
[02:01:48.962 --> 02:01:58.011]  You know, I still thought maybe the progressive branches, you know, the NDN, the New Democratic Network, get on Daily Kos and just hope that we can change the party from within.
[02:01:58.092 --> 02:01:59.993]  And again, I was disappointed.
[02:02:01.015 --> 02:02:07.081]  On Daily Kos, you can't even talk about 9-11 being an inside job or even raise any questions without being edited.
[02:02:07.939 --> 02:02:12.582]  Off the websites by their so-called trusted users.
[02:02:13.123 --> 02:02:17.726]  You also can't bring up issues like the election fraud of 2004 or even of 2000.
[02:02:18.407 --> 02:02:21.729]  And they also don't like you to talk about the 10,000 dead U.S.
[02:02:21.789 --> 02:02:22.189]  soldiers.
[02:02:22.469 --> 02:02:23.890]  They ban you from talking about it.
[02:02:23.910 --> 02:02:27.493]  So I was very disappointed with the Democratic Party overall.
[02:02:27.733 --> 02:02:29.634]  They're just as established as the Republicans.
[02:02:30.295 --> 02:02:31.396]  Same cloth, same people.
[02:02:31.656 --> 02:02:32.717]  Let's talk about it when we get back.
[02:02:32.757 --> 02:02:33.257]  Take calls.
[02:02:33.297 --> 02:02:33.817]  Talk about 9-11.
[02:02:34.018 --> 02:02:34.458]  Talk about this
[02:02:34.838 --> 02:02:37.260]  New development with Building 7 with our guest.
[02:02:37.300 --> 02:02:38.241]  This is really exciting.
[02:02:38.281 --> 02:02:41.663]  It's Brave New Books right here in Austin, Texas with Stephen Conner.
[02:02:42.644 --> 02:02:49.129]  It's here.
[02:02:49.329 --> 02:02:54.113]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:02:54.473 --> 02:03:02.099]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:03:02.813 --> 02:03:09.837]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:03:10.257 --> 02:03:21.704]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:03:22.004 --> 02:03:25.506]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:03:25.966 --> 02:03:27.867]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:03:28.228 --> 02:03:32.070]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:04:44.203 --> 02:04:48.266]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network.
[02:04:48.366 --> 02:04:50.747]  I have an urgent message for all of our listeners.
[02:04:50.807 --> 02:04:57.892]  The mass media keeps telling us that we are the richest, most powerful economy in the world, quote unquote.
[02:04:58.472 --> 02:05:00.753]  If this is true, why can't we pay our bills?
[02:05:01.414 --> 02:05:04.896]  Why is the United States the world's largest debtor nation?
[02:05:05.487 --> 02:05:09.629]  The truth is, is that we are in the worst debt bubble in our nation's history.
[02:05:10.209 --> 02:05:13.190]  When the bubble bursts, will you be able to feed your family?
[02:05:14.170 --> 02:05:17.091]  When the inevitable crash occurs, will you be ready?
[02:05:17.812 --> 02:05:20.433]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.
[02:05:20.573 --> 02:05:21.053]  That's 1-888-892-6238.
[02:05:21.073 --> 02:05:23.794]  For the following two free reports.
[02:05:23.814 --> 02:05:23.854]  U.S.
[02:05:23.914 --> 02:05:26.155]  Debt Bubble, Red Alert, and Real Estate Crash.
[02:05:35.672 --> 02:05:43.560]  Call 888-XANADU, that's 888-X-A-N-A-D-U, and ask for George.
[02:05:45.342 --> 02:05:53.069]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show, because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:05:54.571 --> 02:05:59.015]  Chadwick in Illinois, Holland, Florida, and others are coming up.
[02:05:59.941 --> 02:06:04.466]  Here momentarily, the toll-free number to join us, wide open phones, in this third hour is 1-800-259-9231.
[02:06:04.486 --> 02:06:04.526]  800-259-9231.
[02:06:04.546 --> 02:06:06.609]  Obviously, we're talking a lot about election fraud.
[02:06:13.268 --> 02:06:20.151]  Totally documented, engineers going public, insiders going public in Florida, Canada, Ohio, everywhere.
[02:06:20.171 --> 02:06:21.372]  People that work at Diebold.
[02:06:21.412 --> 02:06:24.413]  But not just Diebold, saying it's a scam, it's a fraud.
[02:06:24.713 --> 02:06:30.696]  People who are 15 points behind in the polls, magically winning by 14, 15, 16 points.
[02:06:30.716 --> 02:06:31.996]  That's a 30 point difference.
[02:06:32.036 --> 02:06:32.997]  That's impossible!
[02:06:33.712 --> 02:06:37.133]  We're seeing things happen in elections that have never happened before.
[02:06:37.193 --> 02:06:38.774]  And again, I'm not for these Democrats.
[02:06:38.794 --> 02:06:39.795]  I'm not for these Republicans.
[02:06:40.315 --> 02:06:47.118]  The point is, I want independent candidates, whether they be Republican or Democrat, being able to be voted for, and for the American people to be able to have their vote.
[02:06:47.158 --> 02:06:48.078]  I mean, come on!
[02:06:49.158 --> 02:06:54.981]  Meanwhile, we have a criminal government totally hijacked by global interest, staging terror attacks, trying to bring us into World War III.
[02:06:55.979 --> 02:07:02.523]  We're joined in studio by a local activist, Stephen Conner, who has sacrificed a lot, given up a really high-paying job.
[02:07:02.564 --> 02:07:11.930]  He travels all over the world and he started Brave New Books here in Austin, Texas at 904 Guadalupe Street downtown.
[02:07:12.330 --> 02:07:17.934]  It's right there on the ground floor underneath the Chase Bank and they're carrying all my documentaries and many other
[02:07:18.634 --> 02:07:19.314]  Documentaries.
[02:07:19.774 --> 02:07:23.075]  And Stephen is kind of having a soft opening right now.
[02:07:23.095 --> 02:07:24.276]  We're going to go to your calls here in a moment.
[02:07:24.576 --> 02:07:25.856]  Stephen, tell us about the bookstore.
[02:07:25.896 --> 02:07:29.917]  Tell us about how folks can visit it or visit the website.
[02:07:29.957 --> 02:07:31.698]  And tell us about some of the screenings you're doing.
[02:07:31.898 --> 02:07:33.458]  You're doing a screening there tonight, in fact.
[02:07:33.898 --> 02:07:35.519]  Yeah, we're showing Loose Change tonight.
[02:07:35.559 --> 02:07:38.500]  We advertised at the Daily Texan all this week.
[02:07:38.540 --> 02:07:46.842]  You've got quite a large ad there with big print saying that 9-11 was an inside job and anyone who's interested should come down and see Loose Change.
[02:07:48.183 --> 02:07:53.205]  We are targeting this to the college audience at the university there.
[02:07:53.225 --> 02:08:01.229]  We're getting a lot of really great response, especially when the kids are giving out flyers off of campus and all the reaction from people is very positive.
[02:08:01.269 --> 02:08:05.711]  So we're at 1904 Guadalupe, the intersection with MLK.
[02:08:06.611 --> 02:08:12.755]  You can find out a little bit more about our opening times and what movies we're going to be screening at BraveNewBookstore.com.
[02:08:37.832 --> 02:09:04.092]  Well, I think there are some different target audiences here, and if we were to show movies simultaneously, whether they're the same movie or not, I mean, I think it would be great just to get as many movies showing all the time all over town, and so people, they might even have a choice of where to go and what to do, but again, we're sort of targeting these kids on campus, and I don't get the impression they necessarily get their information from the same sources that your core audience does.
[02:09:04.782 --> 02:09:05.362]  Absolutely.
[02:09:05.422 --> 02:09:07.903]  We are reaching so many people right now.
[02:09:07.943 --> 02:09:10.824]  There are so many leaders in this fight against the New World Order.
[02:09:10.844 --> 02:09:12.624]  What type of things are you carrying up the store?
[02:09:13.144 --> 02:09:16.005]  Well, we definitely cover election fraud.
[02:09:16.405 --> 02:09:18.625]  We have all kinds of books on 9-11.
[02:09:18.725 --> 02:09:22.646]  Books, DVDs, audio tapes, video tapes.
[02:09:23.106 --> 02:09:29.108]  If you don't have a VCR player, you don't have an audio tape player, we can convert that to DVD or CD format for you.
[02:09:30.008 --> 02:09:33.491]  Again, we're all about getting the information out.
[02:09:33.691 --> 02:09:39.675]  We have a reading room in the back, so you can take these books, go to the back, read them, absorb everything you can.
[02:09:39.715 --> 02:09:41.796]  We've got extensive periodicals in the back.
[02:09:43.317 --> 02:09:47.901]  In the back, we also have a mini cinema, which is where we're doing these screenings.
[02:09:48.081 --> 02:09:51.643]  We want to just have screenings multiple times per week on all these different subjects.
[02:09:51.683 --> 02:09:54.265]  There's so much information to get out.
[02:09:54.285 --> 02:09:57.027]  In addition to those, we do other state-sponsored terrorism.
[02:09:57.945 --> 02:09:59.886]  But then we also go into nutrition.
[02:10:00.966 --> 02:10:04.968]  We got a lot of Blaylock and Blaylock's books.
[02:10:05.728 --> 02:10:13.071]  And we also go into the Federal Reserve and other economic issues, as well as the New World Order overall.
[02:10:13.131 --> 02:10:21.774]  And then, if you want to get deeper down the rabbit hole, you can go and learn about apostate churches and these Satanist leaders of our world that practice occultism.
[02:10:22.506 --> 02:10:24.568]  Boy, and that certainly is a reality I'm going on.
[02:10:24.588 --> 02:10:28.912]  All right, your call is here in just a few minutes at 800-259-9231.
[02:10:29.833 --> 02:10:39.723]  What made you, Stephen, decide to take the plunge and to go from being a big international consultant involved in banking and all this, you know, to just throw in 100% against the New World Order?
[02:10:40.243 --> 02:10:42.044]  Well, I've always been politically aware.
[02:10:42.084 --> 02:10:45.547]  I've cared about the core liberties of our country.
[02:10:48.189 --> 02:10:58.335]  The breadth and depth of my previous political convictions was pretty much that all wars are just exercises for leaders to kill most of their citizenry.
[02:11:00.317 --> 02:11:03.919]  And so I was mainly anti-war and always thought that meant you had to be a Democrat.
[02:11:03.939 --> 02:11:08.943]  I very rarely would hear about conservative leaders who were anti-war.
[02:11:09.983 --> 02:11:27.432]  When September 11th happened, I was in Hong Kong, and I remember on that day, the reporters on the ground saying that there were bombs in the building, and I told everyone that I talked to about it, that, yeah, in a few days, in a few weeks, they're going to reveal that there were explosives in the building, but that never happened.
[02:11:27.472 --> 02:11:37.357]  And then they started this run-up, and at the time, I read The Economist all the time, cover to cover, and curiously, in March of 2002, they said, within a year, we're going to have troops in Iraq.
[02:11:38.945 --> 02:11:41.231]  They said, Bin Laden's about to get you.
[02:11:41.391 --> 02:11:43.356]  They introduced him all over the media.
[02:11:43.396 --> 02:11:44.499]  Here comes the bad man.
[02:11:44.519 --> 02:11:46.163]  I mean, you could see the pre-propaganda.
[02:11:46.564 --> 02:11:48.449]  Right, there was a build-up happening and, uh...
[02:11:49.042 --> 02:12:11.512]  You know, I work for a big hedge fund, the head of the company was a billionaire, and right around in October, he came on one of the morning calls, and usually we're all business, we don't talk about politics, but he said he just had lunch with John Major, and John Major said it's a good idea, we have to go in there to get rid of Saddam, and get those weapons of mass destruction, and I thought, well, he just endorsed the war!
[02:12:12.412 --> 02:12:13.812]  There's this big run-up happening.
[02:12:14.373 --> 02:12:19.334]  There's no evidence to support any of what they're claiming.
[02:12:20.054 --> 02:12:33.777]  I was hoping that it wouldn't go to war, and I still wasn't convinced it would, but he was out there endorsing it, and I called him on it, and he backed away, but I could tell he was endorsing it.
[02:12:34.518 --> 02:12:36.718]  And so I was quite disillusioned at that point.
[02:12:36.798 --> 02:12:39.919]  Our company, we were quite good at what we did.
[02:12:40.815 --> 02:12:49.906]  And we are mantra was logic cold calculating logic go out talk to these people get the most cutting edge up-to-date data that will tell you is demand
[02:12:51.670 --> 02:12:51.890]  Go ahead.
[02:13:10.991 --> 02:13:11.692]  We're good.
[02:13:27.406 --> 02:13:30.268]  I don't trust the government, don't trust other corporations, don't trust what you're being told.
[02:13:53.304 --> 02:13:56.548]  Right, and that's certainly the case in the industry, and that's how we did it.
[02:13:56.608 --> 02:13:57.709]  We were very successful.
[02:13:57.749 --> 02:14:00.432]  We caught inflection points early, and we made money off them.
[02:14:01.213 --> 02:14:12.385]  But then it comes time to take this, and then suddenly we've got the leader of our company endorsing war, which has no logical base at all.
[02:14:13.027 --> 02:14:27.197]  And I was particularly fascinated that our management, which is promoting this logical approach when it comes to stock analysis, and they're totally abandoning that philosophy when it comes to their political beliefs.
[02:14:28.738 --> 02:14:29.359]  It's amazing.
[02:14:29.379 --> 02:14:33.381]  So when did you decide to start a bookstore and a website and start fighting the New World Order?
[02:14:34.282 --> 02:14:41.447]  Well, soon after I was disappointed at the results and the process of the 2004 election,
[02:14:43.106 --> 02:14:46.871]  You know, I was searching for something, some sort of explanation.
[02:14:46.991 --> 02:14:48.132]  I wanted to get involved.
[02:14:48.192 --> 02:15:01.629]  I realized that no aspect of the Democratic Party was going to provide that, and I was in Vancouver in early May of 2005, and a buddy of mine was watching one of your videos.
[02:15:02.463 --> 02:15:10.368]  And you were saying how the UN is, you know, the world government, you're not going to have any rights, no freedom of speech in that system.
[02:15:10.648 --> 02:15:13.470]  And I'd always been trained that the UN was a good thing, so I was a little skeptical.
[02:15:13.490 --> 02:15:17.192]  And then you said the environmental movement is a way to take our land, and I was still a little skeptical.
[02:15:17.232 --> 02:15:19.833]  And then you said the Reichstag was Hitler's 9-11, and that...
[02:15:21.034 --> 02:15:26.959]  It was the state-sponsored terror event that brought in Marshall, and I said, yes, that's absolutely exactly right.
[02:15:27.459 --> 02:15:39.609]  And so I opened my ears wider to what you were saying, and it took me a few months to get out of the deeper and more ingrained aspects of my liberal background, or democratic background, what have you.
[02:15:40.130 --> 02:15:44.593]  But now I have to agree, abortion is the first step to eugenics.
[02:15:44.673 --> 02:15:46.615]  I have to agree that environmentalism is just
[02:15:47.378 --> 02:15:47.759]  Is it?
[02:15:59.697 --> 02:16:03.960]  Well, they sound good on the surface, but it's just like the conservatives sound good on the surface.
[02:16:04.220 --> 02:16:06.822]  It's really just two different brands of the same thing.
[02:16:06.842 --> 02:16:08.342]  I mean, we're all for the environment.
[02:16:08.362 --> 02:16:12.025]  We don't want to drink poison, breathe poison air, but they never do anything about that.
[02:16:12.045 --> 02:16:17.988]  It's the very corporations that are doing that, that are funding the groups, like Nature Conservancy and Sierra Club, that are grabbing all the property.
[02:16:18.849 --> 02:16:21.751]  Right, and you've got these other issues.
[02:16:21.791 --> 02:16:28.595]  I mean, Harlan and Harlan Dietrich, by the way, is the guy I met up in Chicago at the 9-11 conference in early June.
[02:16:29.423 --> 02:16:35.966]  We, uh, he was later quoted, he was the guy quoted in the New York Times and said the left-right paradigm is a joke.
[02:16:37.106 --> 02:16:42.448]  And so we got together here in Austin and we are the team putting this bookstore together.
[02:16:42.468 --> 02:16:52.192]  But we were recently discussing how it's sort of a longer and more tortuous process for liberals to extract themselves from the paradigm than it is for conservatives.
[02:16:52.793 --> 02:16:59.598]  Because liberals, you know, they have to realize that the whole principle of the centralization of power leads to tyranny.
[02:16:59.858 --> 02:17:03.780]  When fewer people control more of the assets, that's exactly what you don't want.
[02:17:04.481 --> 02:17:10.505]  Yeah, because they sell the left that a big centralized government is going to help the people, but it's big corporations actually lobbying for that.
[02:17:13.189 --> 02:17:28.219]  So, when, you know, we were joking that one of the things we're going to have in our bookstore are barf bags for Democrats, like you have said previously on your show, that you've actually seen liberals vomit when they realize what's going on, and we're going to supply the tools to take care of that.
[02:17:28.259 --> 02:17:29.720]  Well, I've gotten nauseated before.
[02:17:29.740 --> 02:17:31.802]  I mean, I got nauseated on 9-11 when I really did it.
[02:17:31.822 --> 02:17:36.225]  I mean, normal persons, you see a bunch of murders take place, you realize psychotic criminals are a running thing.
[02:17:36.705 --> 02:17:39.387]  It's scary at a very deep core, and there's a whole ship.
[02:17:39.827 --> 02:17:44.770]  When you come out of the Matrix, we'll be right back with our guest and I promise we'll restrict your calls.
[02:17:45.890 --> 02:17:51.113]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[02:17:51.273 --> 02:17:59.357]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[02:17:59.617 --> 02:18:06.561]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[02:18:06.841 --> 02:18:08.122]  Radioactive poisoning.
[02:18:08.202 --> 02:18:14.106]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[02:18:14.286 --> 02:18:19.369]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[02:18:19.490 --> 02:18:28.375]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[02:18:28.636 --> 02:18:31.918]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5.
[02:18:34.179 --> 02:18:35.240]  Currency devaluation.
[02:18:35.420 --> 02:18:35.901]  Inflation.
[02:18:35.921 --> 02:18:36.782]  One and the same.
[02:18:55.057 --> 02:19:04.900]  If you had deposited $100,000 in a bank at 1% in a 30-month period dating from May 24, 2005, here is what happened to your funds.
[02:19:05.320 --> 02:19:08.442]  The dollar lost 33% of its value in that time frame.
[02:19:08.702 --> 02:19:10.542]  The bank paid you 1%.
[02:19:10.842 --> 02:19:13.623]  Your $100,000 now has a net purchasing power of $68,000.
[02:19:14.163 --> 02:19:16.384]  Here is reality.
[02:19:16.744 --> 02:19:20.346]  The devaluation of currency equals real inflation.
[02:19:20.826 --> 02:19:24.427]  Keep in mind how the value of your paper assets are measured in dollars.
[02:19:25.034 --> 02:19:28.775]  Gold in the same time frame increased 35% in value.

[02:19:49.162 --> 02:19:54.210]  Did you know that the Bible forecasts signs to let us know that we're in the last days?
[02:19:54.230 --> 02:20:01.000]  The book of Revelation says that world travel, quickly and efficiently, would be one sign, and also knowledge would increase.
[02:20:01.720 --> 02:20:05.122]  Knowledge is doubling every two and a half years in the electronic industry.

[02:21:55.576 --> 02:21:58.358]  My question is, I'm 24 and I live in Chicago.
[02:21:58.418 --> 02:22:00.439]  My question is, you know, I feel, I got in on this
[02:22:21.502 --> 02:22:24.724]  About, you know, three months ago, and I'm completely sold on it.
[02:22:24.864 --> 02:22:31.329]  I completely believe, you know, what you're trying to get across, and I completely appreciate it, and I hold you in high regards, so I just want to get that out of the way.
[02:22:32.590 --> 02:22:35.212]  My point is, I think you've got enough of us convinced.
[02:22:36.012 --> 02:22:37.273]  I think enough of us are out there.
[02:22:37.673 --> 02:22:41.856]  One of the things I keep hearing callers say is, you know, what do we do next?
[02:22:41.916 --> 02:22:42.977]  Where do we go?
[02:22:43.337 --> 02:22:44.098]  And you keep telling us,
[02:22:44.668 --> 02:22:45.068]  Excuse me.
[02:22:45.188 --> 02:22:47.609]  To, uh, you know, start websites, do this, get the word out.
[02:22:47.889 --> 02:23:06.777]  Well, I mean, the urgency is now, um, you know, uh, if they're gonna go to war with Iraq any day, any week, any month, uh, or Iran, excuse me, um, you know, this and that, and then your prediction for, you know, the next event, which, you know, I get up every morning and I wonder if I'm driving down Lakeshore Drive if I'm gonna be driving into a white, brilliant flash of light and that's it, you know?
[02:23:07.410 --> 02:23:09.454]  I would say Chicago is one of the main targets.
[02:23:10.575 --> 02:23:14.382]  Let me try to comment on this, and then we'll go back to you, Chad, and we'll let you continue here.
[02:23:15.544 --> 02:23:20.085]  Understand, my prediction of terror attack by late October is the same thing we had back in 2001.
[02:23:20.125 --> 02:23:22.506]  I'm saying if we do get the word out, we can't stop it.
[02:23:22.806 --> 02:23:32.729]  It's a warning to stop it, and it looks like, I don't want to cut back on the urgency so people don't keep warning people so it does happen, but you know, we got Fox News paying attention to the warnings this time.
[02:23:33.110 --> 02:23:34.310]  We've got it all over the web.
[02:23:34.370 --> 02:23:35.710]  People are still paying attention to it.
[02:23:35.730 --> 02:23:40.752]  We've got to keep pushing and making sure that people see this confluence of elements.
[02:23:41.532 --> 02:23:50.921]  But you just noticed what Stephen Conner did, going around for a big hedge fund, gathering data on what people really were buying, what trends were really doing.
[02:23:51.221 --> 02:24:01.150]  Well, even bigger companies use the NSA, that's its main function, to listen to data and grab websites and communications to find out what the new big buzz is going to be.
[02:24:01.630 --> 02:24:05.393]  They have all these algorithms that track the trends, all of that.
[02:24:05.473 --> 02:24:07.135]  So if they're tracking the trends,
[02:24:07.695 --> 02:24:14.201]  And see that really 60% of people, which I believe it's over 60 now, 36% in the poll said they believe it's an inside job.
[02:24:14.482 --> 02:24:15.322]  Guaranteed that's double.
[02:24:15.723 --> 02:24:18.165]  Okay, so 47% said it's an inside job, it's more like 80.
[02:24:18.726 --> 02:24:23.190]  But I would say it's probably about 60% deep down know it's an inside job or have serious questions.
[02:24:23.510 --> 02:24:24.211]  The NSA...
[02:24:25.126 --> 02:24:29.731]  He's picking up on that in phone conversations, in private emails, in other transmissions.
[02:24:29.791 --> 02:24:33.636]  That's why they put out the news of NSA spying to try to chill affect everybody.
[02:24:33.656 --> 02:24:35.117]  So yeah, we are listening to you.
[02:24:35.398 --> 02:24:36.299]  Now shut up!
[02:24:37.340 --> 02:24:42.766]  So if we've got 30, 40, 50, 60 percent, if you all go out and wake up one person,
[02:24:43.046 --> 02:24:44.367]  We're now at eighty percent.
[02:24:44.387 --> 02:24:45.928]  You're not going to wake up to twenty percent.
[02:24:45.968 --> 02:24:47.870]  So, sir, education is the key.
[02:24:47.950 --> 02:24:53.414]  You may know, your friends may know, you may wear an Infowars t-shirt down the street in Chicago and have twenty people come up to you.
[02:24:53.755 --> 02:24:54.895]  That is not enough, sir.
[02:24:55.196 --> 02:25:01.441]  We have got to push it way over the edge, totally discredit the mainstream media, and we're talking about solutions.
[02:25:01.461 --> 02:25:05.384]  We're talking about expose electronic voting machines, you know, control the border, expose this.
[02:25:05.664 --> 02:25:10.688]  You know, we're fighting on so many fronts, but if you're wanting one
[02:25:10.768 --> 02:25:11.629]  No, no, no.
[02:25:33.066 --> 02:25:34.306]  Yeah, that's funny you say that.
[02:25:34.326 --> 02:25:39.709]  I actually drive around, I work in an advertising agency and actually I do billboards and it's funny because I'm 24 and I don't have the resources.
[02:25:54.164 --> 02:25:57.809]  To print my own billboards and pay for the space, but I could coordinate it if I had the money, but I don't.
[02:25:58.070 --> 02:26:04.479]  But I actually drive around with my, you know, 9-11 with an inside job, see for yourself, Google Video, search on iList, boost change and terrorist, terrorist storm.
[02:26:05.109 --> 02:26:06.230]  I mean, it's on the back of my car.
[02:26:06.290 --> 02:26:06.810]  That's awesome.
[02:26:06.850 --> 02:26:07.971]  Let me tell you something else.
[02:26:08.011 --> 02:26:25.802]  I'm against spray painting and vandalism of private property, but when it's a billboard that used our tax money, a billboard that says something like, we're watching you, tattle on your neighbor, you're going out tonight, so are we, it would really upset me, wink wink, if people climbed up those at night, please don't fall down here.
[02:26:25.822 --> 02:26:28.844]  My point is, spraypaintinfowars.com, across them.
[02:26:29.064 --> 02:26:31.706]  I mean, look, we're in a war against terrorists here, okay?
[02:26:32.126 --> 02:26:34.368]  And so we've got to fight them however we can.
[02:26:34.688 --> 02:26:43.651]  I know I don't have a lot of time, but my point is, I can't stop thinking about the boy, or the student from China standing in front of that tank in Tiananmen Square, or the peace rallies in the 60s.
[02:26:43.991 --> 02:26:44.831]  Where is that today?
[02:26:44.851 --> 02:26:46.012]  Why isn't it happening?
[02:26:46.272 --> 02:26:49.052]  And I just, we do feel isolated.
[02:26:49.092 --> 02:26:55.074]  My generation, we don't know how to, we need direction, and we need, I mean, we all look to you, we all listen to you, we turn to you every day.
[02:26:55.114 --> 02:26:57.315]  I mean, where is, I mean, I guarantee you there's
[02:26:57.955 --> 02:27:04.557]  A huge number of listeners right now that knew if they could go to a... I mean, I was here when the Mexican rallies were here.
[02:27:04.857 --> 02:27:05.497]  500,000 people in the city.
[02:27:05.537 --> 02:27:06.318]  It shut the city down.
[02:27:06.378 --> 02:27:07.018]  It was all over the news.
[02:27:07.778 --> 02:27:10.739]  Why didn't I get my job and go to that today or tomorrow?
[02:27:10.759 --> 02:27:12.460]  I want to go there now.
[02:27:12.600 --> 02:27:13.460]  I want to hold the bullhorn.
[02:27:13.480 --> 02:27:14.380]  I want to hold up the sign.
[02:27:14.680 --> 02:27:16.521]  I want the media to have no... Do it!
[02:27:16.541 --> 02:27:16.961]  Do it!
[02:27:17.061 --> 02:27:17.321]  Do it!
[02:27:17.341 --> 02:27:19.022]  But just know this, my friend... How do you do it?
[02:27:19.142 --> 02:27:19.962]  Where's the organization?
[02:27:20.042 --> 02:27:21.163]  Listen, I appreciate your call.
[02:27:21.583 --> 02:27:22.363]  It's the opposite.
[02:27:23.529 --> 02:27:24.669]  Let me explain this when we get back.
[02:27:24.689 --> 02:27:26.750]  Then we're going to talk to our guests some more and take more calls.
[02:27:27.290 --> 02:27:27.650]  Okay?
[02:27:28.290 --> 02:27:30.211]  What did those demonstrations really do?
[02:27:30.751 --> 02:27:32.851]  They blew up in their face because they were fake.
[02:27:33.192 --> 02:27:33.712]  We'll be right back.
[02:27:36.172 --> 02:27:37.072]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.553 --> 02:27:39.153]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:40.093 --> 02:27:42.754]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:47.481 --> 02:27:54.106]  If you're looking at the world today from within the box, you must see total chaos and feel lost with no hope.
[02:27:55.087 --> 02:28:02.873]  Out-of-the-box thinkers, such as Nostradamus, who saw the world from a different perspective, knew that nature or God's truth would prevail.
[02:28:03.594 --> 02:28:12.841]  They saw that today's organized religions and governments are being judged, not with the hand of man through atomic wars, but with the hand of God through natural disasters.
[02:28:13.795 --> 02:28:20.457]  We are judging ourselves during this trying apocalyptic period by all our hidden truths being uncovered.
[02:28:20.737 --> 02:28:22.878]  Don't you see this happening through the media today?
[02:28:23.298 --> 02:28:25.058]  Just remember these famous words.
[02:28:25.518 --> 02:28:29.039]  Everything hidden will be uncovered and the truth will make you free.
[02:28:30.019 --> 02:28:35.921]  For evidence of these statements, get Jerry Vano's new book, The Uncovering of the Greatest Story Never Told.
[02:28:36.261 --> 02:28:39.502]  Go to www.gvano.com.
[02:28:39.702 --> 02:28:42.043]  That's www.gvano.com.
[02:28:47.682 --> 02:28:48.723]  The War on Terrorism.
[02:28:49.044 --> 02:28:51.847]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[02:28:52.107 --> 02:28:56.272]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[02:28:56.692 --> 02:28:57.533]  So what do you do?
[02:28:57.834 --> 02:29:02.439]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[02:29:02.899 --> 02:29:04.982]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.

[02:29:45.776 --> 02:29:52.618]  In December 2005, CNN had a special documentary about the inevitability of nuclear terrorism on American soil.
[02:29:52.878 --> 02:29:58.439]  When the mainstream media is reporting on such a perilous topic with such candor, it should be taken very seriously.

[02:30:00.660 --> 02:30:05.324]  The ultimate secure home is strategically located in the awesome mountains of southwest Colorado.

[02:30:48.911 --> 02:30:51.434]  Don't worry, this show is documented.
[02:30:51.934 --> 02:30:55.237]  Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:55.678 --> 02:31:07.129]  Alright, let me try to briefly answer that caller's last frustration and question.
[02:31:07.349 --> 02:31:13.595]  Now this was in the Dallas Morning News, hidden in plain view, but I talked to even top anti-immigration strategists and members of Congress, they don't know about it.
[02:31:14.233 --> 02:31:15.414]  Rob Allen & Co.
[02:31:15.654 --> 02:31:25.402]  is a Republican PR firm, one of the biggest in the country, so they do a bunch of other ad campaigns for other companies, but they're a Republican firm when they do politics.
[02:31:26.223 --> 02:31:33.489]  They, because he was Coca-Cola executive, hired, was it that Fox hired him back when he was a governor?
[02:31:34.550 --> 02:31:36.011]  Bush hired him when he was governor?
[02:31:36.811 --> 02:31:39.914]  This is the group that really strategized with Karl Rove.
[02:31:40.709 --> 02:31:48.151]  So if the film Bush's Brain wanted to be accurate, it would really be Rob Allen and Co., and then Karl Rove basically organizing the day-to-day events.
[02:31:49.031 --> 02:31:51.932]  And then when Bush ran for President, it was Rob Allen and Co.
[02:31:52.352 --> 02:31:55.333]  And when Fox ran for President, it was Rob Allen and Co.
[02:31:56.254 --> 02:31:57.454]  And Rob Allen and Company,
[02:31:58.656 --> 02:32:05.841]  Even helped run some of the election systems and was advising the feds down there in the last two with the big stolen election we just saw in Mexico.
[02:32:06.361 --> 02:32:13.385]  It never ends and they bragged and it said in the paper that Rob Allen doesn't like people knowing this but he runs it all.
[02:32:14.706 --> 02:32:23.251]  They admitted right there that in the next few months they were going to organize huge demonstrations for the guest worker program, the amnesty program.
[02:32:24.432 --> 02:32:25.613]  So Rob Allen Co.
[02:32:25.793 --> 02:32:27.474]  spent tens of millions of dollars
[02:32:28.445 --> 02:32:31.446]  Going out and paying for PR, buying off reporters.
[02:32:31.486 --> 02:32:33.227]  And by buying off reporters, they do it legally.
[02:32:33.247 --> 02:32:35.308]  They go and just buy ad space.
[02:32:35.328 --> 02:32:39.729]  There's propaganda placement or product placement already on most of your news channels, radio, TV.
[02:32:40.169 --> 02:32:41.510]  So they went and did all of this.
[02:32:41.550 --> 02:32:42.170]  They hyped it.
[02:32:42.650 --> 02:32:46.612]  They went and instructed the local illegal alien groups, the local liberal groups that controlled it.
[02:32:46.632 --> 02:32:53.274]  I mean, here's all the Democratic groups, grassroots, being conned, being ordered, being manipulated, getting their walking orders from Rob Allen & Co.
[02:32:53.294 --> 02:32:54.495]  It's just too sweet.
[02:32:55.155 --> 02:33:08.060]  And then for four months, from December to three and a half months into this year, they hyped it every day on Spanish TV, on Spanish radio, very aggressively.
[02:33:08.658 --> 02:33:10.019]  And then they said, all right, go out there.
[02:33:10.059 --> 02:33:13.981]  They had trucks delivered there with all these American flags.
[02:33:14.241 --> 02:33:15.301]  They tried to serve them up.
[02:33:15.321 --> 02:33:16.762]  It backfired, though.
[02:33:17.162 --> 02:33:21.044]  The Mexican illegal alien crowd, who again, most of them are well-meaning.
[02:33:21.064 --> 02:33:24.526]  They're just filled with hate and have wanted a revolution down in Mexico.
[02:33:24.806 --> 02:33:25.647]  They were never given it.
[02:33:26.027 --> 02:33:29.749]  All that energy now is being focused into the United States.
[02:33:30.449 --> 02:33:34.573]  You know, I mean, it is a base need to rebel against tyranny, so now they've been told it's all America's fault.
[02:33:34.913 --> 02:33:42.319]  And in a way, it's true, because there's the elites here that have dominated Mexico that have set this up, but again, those elites are in power because they're sophisticated.
[02:33:42.519 --> 02:33:49.425]  They're the very same ones that then are now manipulating them to destroy the United States' sovereignty and the middle class in this country.
[02:33:50.266 --> 02:34:04.657]  But, it went from 87% being against the amnesty, to 90% being against the amnesty, and made everybody totally outraged, including the majority of Hispanics, to see American flags being taken down, Mexican flags everywhere for the first two weeks.
[02:34:05.137 --> 02:34:11.362]  Now, it was only scheduled for two weeks, but it went for another three weeks because Rob Allen and co.
[02:34:11.442 --> 02:34:16.726]  panicked and was ordering the groups, hey, hand out these American flags, hey, say you're pro-America.
[02:34:17.498 --> 02:34:21.741]  They tried to then manage the media and tell them what to say, but then it didn't work.
[02:34:21.821 --> 02:34:23.602]  It blew apart in front of them.
[02:34:23.682 --> 02:34:29.506]  So, you see, you know, 5 million illegal aliens in the streets, and that's conservative.
[02:34:29.526 --> 02:34:38.913]  You know, 500,000 in Chicago, a million in L.A., 300,000 in New York, tens of thousands in Austin, hundreds of thousands in San Antonio, Dallas, Houston.
[02:34:38.933 --> 02:34:41.354]  I mean, it was, I just say 5 million.
[02:34:41.414 --> 02:34:42.255]  I know it's over that.
[02:34:42.615 --> 02:34:49.260]  I mean, we're talking millions and millions and millions and millions and millions, aggressively taking over highways, running around doing all this.
[02:34:49.760 --> 02:34:54.043]  You would see that of the media for four months, hyped, go protest the war!
[02:34:55.109 --> 02:34:58.672]  But notice how they made it look good that the illegal aliens were protesting.
[02:34:58.712 --> 02:35:01.815]  Tried to make them look like patriots, but again, the images didn't lie.
[02:35:02.315 --> 02:35:12.604]  Whenever anti-war people are out, they focus in on the fight, they focus in on the tear gas, they focus in on the person with, you know, 15 rings in their nose, the person who, you know, looks, who's dressed up like a woman.
[02:35:13.602 --> 02:35:18.229]  It's meant to look, this is dangerous, this is bad, this is fringe, this isn't good.
[02:35:18.769 --> 02:35:23.215]  Oh, but the illegal aliens with Mexican flags, this is as American as mom and apple pie.
[02:35:23.235 --> 02:35:28.543]  So, I don't want to sit here and rant and rave and burn up all the time here.
[02:35:29.247 --> 02:35:33.029]  Don't expect real revolution to look like that, okay?
[02:35:34.230 --> 02:35:40.233]  I mean, it might be occasionally, say, in Serbia or with Ceausescu in Romania, but it's very, very rare.
[02:35:40.693 --> 02:35:43.254]  Revolution is police saying no to the corrupt system.
[02:35:43.594 --> 02:35:46.276]  Revolution is government officials leaking information.
[02:35:46.636 --> 02:35:50.318]  Revolution are federal judges calling for investigations.
[02:35:50.618 --> 02:35:53.079]  Grand juries calling for investigations.
[02:35:53.559 --> 02:35:56.601]  Revolution is people opening bookstores and films being shown.
[02:35:56.962 --> 02:36:00.905]  And revolution is people inside the troops, 70 plus percent against the war.
[02:36:01.805 --> 02:36:06.008]  Revolution is people refusing to be drafted even when they change the name to conscription.
[02:36:06.469 --> 02:36:11.332]  Revolution is saying no first in your mind and then putting it out into action.
[02:36:11.713 --> 02:36:13.134]  So do what you're doing, sir.
[02:36:13.514 --> 02:36:14.234]  Get out there.
[02:36:14.455 --> 02:36:15.235]  Wake people up.
[02:36:15.315 --> 02:36:16.336]  Keep doing what you're doing.
[02:36:17.373 --> 02:36:23.964]  Hollywood has taught us this archetypal image of the heroes, this big Schwarzenegger type, this Hercules type.
[02:36:24.841 --> 02:36:30.626]  Who archetypally defeats the Big Ogre, you know, the Beowulf defending the people from Grendel.
[02:36:31.266 --> 02:36:33.828]  All of this, and that's not how real heroes are most of the time.
[02:36:34.248 --> 02:36:36.630]  Real heroes go against adversity.
[02:36:36.650 --> 02:36:37.711]  Real heroes have courage.
[02:36:37.751 --> 02:36:39.232]  Real heroes say no.
[02:36:39.312 --> 02:36:40.493]  Real heroes get arrested.
[02:36:40.773 --> 02:36:44.856]  Real heroes write books and get attacked and called traitors.
[02:36:45.217 --> 02:36:48.079]  Real heroes have moral courage.
[02:36:48.579 --> 02:37:03.202]  And so this is a process, and we're starting to win this process, but we're in a race against time, because if we don't expose government-sponsored terror, they're going to be able to carry out one more big event that will take us totally into martial law, and then they're still going to fail.
[02:37:03.262 --> 02:37:04.542]  And I think they've calculated that now.
[02:37:04.562 --> 02:37:10.923]  I think they know now that if they were to pull something off really big and try to go into pure martial law, there's a good chance they're still going to lose.
[02:37:11.283 --> 02:37:16.964]  But as we win, we're probably going to force them into that anyways, so it's better that as we go into that dangerous paradigm,
[02:37:18.525 --> 02:37:26.772]  Into that dangerous sector of our technological, historical development as a civilization.
[02:37:27.072 --> 02:37:34.879]  Isn't it better if they're going to do it one way or the other that we go ahead and go into it with a lot of people awake, a lot of people angry, a lot of people informed, you see?
[02:37:35.848 --> 02:37:36.329]  That's right.
[02:37:54.824 --> 02:37:55.924]  Get the information out.
[02:37:55.964 --> 02:37:58.225]  I mean, just like Alex said, you've got a market out there.
[02:37:58.245 --> 02:38:05.928]  50-60% of the population of the country knows that most of what's on the mainstream media is a lie, that 9-11 was an inside job.
[02:38:06.209 --> 02:38:08.229]  And they have nowhere to get their information now.
[02:38:08.590 --> 02:38:11.051]  Right now, there's a huge market out there.
[02:38:11.131 --> 02:38:16.653]  Anyone out there can open up bookstores of any size, be it in large or small cities across the nation.
[02:38:17.033 --> 02:38:18.594]  You give out loose change.
[02:38:18.614 --> 02:38:20.014]  Give out Alex's videos for free.
[02:38:20.334 --> 02:38:21.935]  Stimulate interest in the subject.
[02:38:22.575 --> 02:38:22.815]  I think?
[02:38:42.083 --> 02:38:55.842]  Nightmare situation already is because so many Americans are armed I would suggest that more people get armed Especially the liberals that have been squeamish about it to this point and then finally lose your fear There's nothing to be afraid of it's living life.
[02:38:55.902 --> 02:38:56.183]  I mean I
[02:38:57.044 --> 02:39:03.711]  If you want to go and hide away on an island somewhere while the rest of the world goes by, that's not living life.
[02:39:04.592 --> 02:39:06.874]  Quite frankly, I don't think there's anything to be afraid of.
[02:39:06.934 --> 02:39:07.675]  We are in America.
[02:39:07.715 --> 02:39:11.299]  This is the best possible place you can be at this time of the world.
[02:39:13.374 --> 02:39:15.395]  So take advantage of the fact you are here.
[02:39:15.455 --> 02:39:22.159]  Take advantage of the fact that you have the opportunity as an American to defend the world from global tyranny, because we are the last bastion.
[02:39:22.219 --> 02:39:24.800]  I think Texas is at the front lines of this battle as well.
[02:39:25.280 --> 02:39:26.001]  I agree with you.
[02:39:26.101 --> 02:39:27.482]  And here's a program note.
[02:39:27.602 --> 02:39:39.208]  Mike Malloy, who has the most courage of anybody on Air America, who's been exposing 9-11 as an inside job, we got an email about 30 minutes ago that he'd been fired, but I don't believe emails, even though I, you know,
[02:39:39.608 --> 02:39:41.490]  I'm sure it's nice people sending them to us.
[02:39:41.790 --> 02:39:43.231]  We called Mike Malloy at home.
[02:39:44.452 --> 02:39:46.875]  He was indeed fired last night.
[02:39:46.975 --> 02:39:47.815]  He doesn't even know why.
[02:39:47.836 --> 02:39:49.257]  He's going in for a meeting today.
[02:39:49.277 --> 02:39:53.381]  We'll try to get Mike Malloy on tomorrow to tell you why he was fired.
[02:39:54.341 --> 02:40:00.107]  But, you know, there's another example of people being punished for telling the truth, for getting the word out.
[02:40:00.827 --> 02:40:02.789]  And it's really sad that this has happened.
[02:40:02.809 --> 02:40:05.792]  We need to ask that Mike Malloy be reinstated at Air America.
[02:40:06.588 --> 02:40:14.977]  Or who knows, maybe Ted Anderson can get on the ball and call up and try to give Mike Molloy a radio show right here on the GCN radio network.
[02:40:15.057 --> 02:40:21.244]  But this is just, I mean, he's a good guy and we were talking, Stephen, during the break about how
[02:40:22.545 --> 02:40:25.108]  We have this guy on the air and he's saying, I'm not going out and down.
[02:40:25.148 --> 02:40:27.069]  He's a former CNN producer and executive.
[02:40:27.409 --> 02:40:29.051]  He goes, I'm not going down without a fight.
[02:40:29.371 --> 02:40:30.192]  I've bought guns.
[02:40:30.552 --> 02:40:32.233]  I'm ready to fight if they try to take over.
[02:40:32.254 --> 02:40:33.334]  That might even have been in the comment.
[02:40:33.354 --> 02:40:34.175]  Who knows why he got fired.
[02:40:35.156 --> 02:40:38.218]  And, you know, I'm telling all the liberals to go out there and get guns.
[02:40:38.499 --> 02:40:41.922]  And meanwhile, Limbaugh's on air making excuses for Bush's gun control.
[02:40:42.262 --> 02:40:44.804]  In there, you know, maybe we need the assault weapons ban.
[02:40:45.064 --> 02:40:47.826]  I mean, Limbaugh's for gun control and Mike Malloy isn't.
[02:40:47.846 --> 02:40:48.387]  You want to comment?
[02:40:49.713 --> 02:40:57.859]  Well, it just underlines the total ridiculousness of this left-right paradigm.
[02:40:57.879 --> 02:41:03.443]  You've got the liberals buying guns and the conservatives saying, you know, give up your guns.
[02:41:03.543 --> 02:41:15.451]  The left-right paradigm is completely false, and that's why at our bookstore we sort of put traditional lefty topics like environmentalism next to topics that are traditionally more popular with conservatives like Second Amendment issues.
[02:41:15.931 --> 02:41:20.734]  And, you know, similarly we'll put health issues and genetically modified foods.
[02:41:20.814 --> 02:41:23.275]  No one's for genetically modified foods when they know about it.
[02:41:23.295 --> 02:41:27.797]  It's another one of those 99% issues, like no one wants further consolidation.
[02:41:27.817 --> 02:41:28.638]  You know, that's really it.
[02:41:28.678 --> 02:41:33.520]  The establishment is going against history, the people, common sense, the Bill of Rights, the Constitution.
[02:41:33.881 --> 02:41:39.143]  Every issue we're into, we've got like 70 or more percent, most of them 90 plus percent.
[02:41:39.404 --> 02:41:40.664]  We're what the people want.
[02:41:40.704 --> 02:41:41.905]  We're just here telling the truth.
[02:41:42.561 --> 02:41:43.302]  Right, exactly.
[02:41:44.442 --> 02:41:48.865]  So you've got to get informed, and don't be afraid, my goodness.
[02:41:49.485 --> 02:41:55.429]  Harlan and I were expecting much more pushback, much more uphill struggle in getting the word out.
[02:41:55.469 --> 02:41:59.572]  We were expecting to get more negative feedback, and quite frankly, we haven't come across it.
[02:41:59.892 --> 02:42:06.216]  The ground out there is incredibly fertile thanks to your hard work, Alex, over these years, and people take advantage of it.
[02:42:07.245 --> 02:42:15.034]  You know, get on your surfboard, get at the crest of that wave because it's coming in and it's coming in fast and we just need to add momentum to it.
[02:42:15.635 --> 02:42:19.820]  Well, as I always say, for every action there's an equal reaction or a greater reaction and
[02:42:20.863 --> 02:42:22.445]  The evil is rising right now.
[02:42:22.485 --> 02:42:24.126]  I mean, the corruption is exploding.
[02:42:24.206 --> 02:42:25.067]  It's taking over.
[02:42:25.467 --> 02:42:27.990]  So, of course, you're going to see a great reaction against it.
[02:42:28.370 --> 02:42:31.413]  And I hear these whimpering, whining people saying, oh, they'll get me.
[02:42:31.453 --> 02:42:32.473]  There's nothing I can do.
[02:42:32.874 --> 02:42:34.555]  Folks, they're going to get you one way or the other.
[02:42:34.575 --> 02:42:36.877]  They're definitely going to get you if you don't fight.
[02:42:37.218 --> 02:42:40.881]  Roll it over like a sheep to the wolves is not going to save you.
[02:42:41.425 --> 02:42:48.507]  Right, and we are already planning next week at the bookstore to have a topic of the week being election fraud, the false left-right paradigm.
[02:42:48.527 --> 02:42:53.048]  We are planning to show American Dictators at the bookstore next Friday.
[02:42:53.548 --> 02:42:56.129]  We were hoping to not overlap with your dates.
[02:42:56.209 --> 02:42:57.249]  Oh no, show whatever you want.
[02:42:57.509 --> 02:42:57.810]  Okay.
[02:42:58.270 --> 02:43:00.610]  Listen, I told you on September 11th I'm going to be in New York.
[02:43:00.690 --> 02:43:02.691]  You can show Terror Storm over there if you want.
[02:43:02.991 --> 02:43:04.391]  That would be incredibly awesome.
[02:43:04.411 --> 02:43:05.332]  We want to do that.
[02:43:05.372 --> 02:43:10.013]  My favorite part in that movie is when you're talking to the English newspaper lady and she's
[02:43:10.553 --> 02:43:13.938]  And you're asking, yeah, well, you know, Demenda's got shot eight times in the head.
[02:43:13.958 --> 02:43:16.442]  She's like, yeah, well, that is a lot of times to be shot in the head.
[02:43:16.482 --> 02:43:17.163]  Yeah, really.
[02:43:17.183 --> 02:43:20.868]  And then she laughs and says, I want to give up my liberty for freedom.
[02:43:21.029 --> 02:43:21.649]  Exactly.
[02:43:21.710 --> 02:43:22.451]  Just incredible.
[02:43:22.471 --> 02:43:23.412]  You've got this double thing.
[02:43:23.432 --> 02:43:25.135]  You've got this false left-right paradigm.
[02:43:25.955 --> 02:43:36.843]  I think American Dictators does a great job of underlining the futility of supporting either the left or the right exclusively and underlines the inconsistencies in both of those platforms.
[02:43:36.923 --> 02:43:43.327]  If you want to find what's most appealing on either the left or the right, we've got it at our store.
[02:43:43.687 --> 02:43:46.129]  Like I said, you don't have to come in and spend a bunch of money.
[02:43:46.149 --> 02:43:47.350]  You can come in and read it.
[02:43:47.370 --> 02:43:48.511]  You can take it to the back.
[02:43:48.531 --> 02:43:50.112]  We've got wireless internet there.
[02:43:50.792 --> 02:43:51.433]  Yeah, I think so.
[02:44:04.605 --> 02:44:10.089]  Establish physical places where people can gather and talk.
[02:44:10.329 --> 02:44:11.090]  Strongholds!
[02:44:11.470 --> 02:44:14.933]  Especially when we know the Internet's coming under more and more control.
[02:44:15.253 --> 02:44:19.536]  Your net buddies are not going to save you when the New World Order comes in.
[02:44:19.796 --> 02:44:20.717]  You need to know your neighbors.
[02:44:20.737 --> 02:44:21.758]  That means people in your city.
[02:44:21.778 --> 02:44:22.198]  I agree.
[02:44:22.398 --> 02:44:23.299]  Let's take a call here.
[02:44:23.359 --> 02:44:24.100]  Greg in Texas.
[02:44:24.120 --> 02:44:25.240]  Thanks for holding her on the air.
[02:44:26.161 --> 02:44:26.541]  Yes, sir.
[02:44:26.962 --> 02:44:29.904]  Since you're in the broadcasting business, I thought you might know something about this.
[02:44:30.604 --> 02:44:31.225]  I'm in Austin.
[02:44:31.909 --> 02:44:41.574]  And you may know that over the last year or so, they've had these religious, quasi-religious kind of stations come up, pop up on the radio.
[02:44:41.694 --> 02:44:45.956]  One of them took over the 102.3 Classic Rock station.
[02:44:48.077 --> 02:45:00.584]  My question is, I was talking to somebody who'd been in the radio advertising business, and he told me that these stations are operating not only on, they not only get
[02:45:01.516 --> 02:45:08.058]  Tax breaks, they're getting tax rebates, because their ratings really show up as a blip.
[02:45:10.219 --> 02:45:14.821]  You've got a bunch of Christian stations, if you want to call them that, basically.
[02:45:15.381 --> 02:45:28.066]  I actually, on KXL, not KCXL, we're on Kansas City, KXL here in Austin, I actually, about 6 months after 9-11, actually heard a weird promo they aired where they said George Bush was God.
[02:45:28.955 --> 02:45:35.781]  And I'll never forget, I almost ran off the road, and since you brought this up Carl, let me just briefly tell you how the promo went.
[02:45:36.181 --> 02:45:41.486]  For about a minute, it was like Patriotic Music Planet was going, Our Lord, Our Savior.
[02:45:42.364 --> 02:45:43.805]  He cares about us.
[02:45:44.386 --> 02:45:45.487]  He's our Lord.
[02:45:45.947 --> 02:45:47.168]  He fights for the weak.
[02:45:47.208 --> 02:45:48.830]  He's good to the weak.
[02:45:49.210 --> 02:45:51.272]  He stands for us during adversity.
[02:45:51.872 --> 02:45:53.994]  And during it, it's George Bush talking.
[02:45:54.434 --> 02:45:55.395]  It was like a three-minute promo.
[02:45:55.415 --> 02:45:58.898]  It's like George Bush would say something and, We're never going to back down from the terrorists.
[02:45:58.918 --> 02:46:00.340]  And then, He's our Lord.
[02:46:00.680 --> 02:46:02.461]  And I should have gotten a tape of it.
[02:46:02.481 --> 02:46:04.203]  It was some national show beaming this out.
[02:46:05.058 --> 02:46:08.820]  Here locally, and then at the end it went, He's our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.
[02:46:09.180 --> 02:46:12.781]  But if you heard the promo, they're saying George Bush is Jesus.
[02:46:13.422 --> 02:46:16.383]  And I mean, you know, it is unbelievable.
[02:46:16.603 --> 02:46:18.504]  But that's why nobody listens to those stations.
[02:46:18.984 --> 02:46:21.785]  Nobody listens to those because it's just there to pacify.
[02:46:22.515 --> 02:46:26.518]  Yeah, does it sound like part of this, I guess, you were a loader or takeover?
[02:46:26.658 --> 02:46:50.193]  Oh yeah, they've hired 13,000 plus preachers in every 13,000 counties to tell their flocks to turn in their guns, take the shots, have their families broken up, Romans 13, only do what George Bush says, and now they've got billions they're spending in faith-based initiative, which the court said was unconstitutional, but they still just fund it under new names, and yeah, it's not pretty.
[02:46:51.317 --> 02:46:52.338]  Yeah, I think so.
[02:47:04.068 --> 02:47:10.491]  To wear the $3,000 suit and drive around in a Cadillac with a bunch of gold all over them, and they're there to make Christians look bad.
[02:47:10.551 --> 02:47:14.693]  It's like George Bush is there to make conservatives look bad.
[02:47:14.713 --> 02:47:24.078]  You see, he's meant to create now a big liberal counter-revolution that'll be just as corrupt, and then the cycle, and then, oh, a Republican will save us from the evil liberal.
[02:47:24.378 --> 02:47:26.279]  This is how they kind of energize each other.
[02:47:26.679 --> 02:47:28.680]  Let's talk to Adam in Missouri.
[02:47:28.781 --> 02:47:29.501]  Adam, you're on the air.
[02:47:31.109 --> 02:47:31.969]  Hi Alex, can you hear me?
[02:47:32.069 --> 02:47:32.790]  Yes, sir.
[02:47:33.130 --> 02:47:34.850]  I just heard mention of KCXL.
[02:47:34.870 --> 02:47:36.611]  That's actually what I'm listening to you on today.
[02:47:36.671 --> 02:47:37.551]  Yeah, they're great folks.
[02:47:37.911 --> 02:47:43.213]  Yeah, I just wanted to tell you... And they got a bookstore, by the way, that carries my stuff, so get in there and support them.
[02:47:43.233 --> 02:47:43.773]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:47:44.254 --> 02:47:44.754]  Absolutely.
[02:47:45.434 --> 02:47:48.055]  Just picked up four of your videos here recently.
[02:47:48.075 --> 02:47:51.216]  Wanted to first commend you on your interview with David Gergen.
[02:47:51.916 --> 02:47:52.897]  That was top-notch.
[02:47:53.177 --> 02:47:54.197]  Definitely a three-pointer.
[02:47:54.237 --> 02:47:55.858]  I think you commented on that in the show.
[02:47:56.278 --> 02:47:56.438]  Yeah.
[02:47:57.557 --> 02:48:05.363]  But wanted to ask you real quick, I'm attending a forum here this weekend on September 2nd, in which Jim Hoffman will be speaking.
[02:48:05.823 --> 02:48:11.486]  Wanted to first get a feeling from you on Jim and anything you know about him.
[02:48:12.087 --> 02:48:24.535]  Also, I had looked at some of his information on his website, and I'd noticed that Dave Von Kleist, he's kind of said that there are some things there being still perpetrated on the Power Hour.
[02:48:25.293 --> 02:48:26.695]  Well, stay there.
[02:48:26.715 --> 02:48:29.418]  I'll tell you what I think of Mr. Hoffman when we get back, okay?
[02:48:29.438 --> 02:48:30.499]  And let you finish your question.
[02:48:30.939 --> 02:48:32.841]  Then we'll talk to Jim in Texas, and that's going to be it.
[02:48:32.861 --> 02:48:35.885]  I know we've got a lot of other callers, but we've just run out of time here.
[02:48:35.905 --> 02:48:38.628]  This has been another great broadcast.
[02:48:38.648 --> 02:48:40.350]  We'll get some final comments from our guests as well.
[02:48:40.730 --> 02:48:43.393]  Stephen Conner with Brave New Books.
[02:48:43.553 --> 02:48:43.954]  Stay with us.
[02:48:48.926 --> 02:48:49.386]  It's here!
[02:48:49.606 --> 02:48:54.387]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:48:54.747 --> 02:49:02.409]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:49:03.089 --> 02:49:10.130]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:49:10.531 --> 02:49:17.392]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying,
[02:49:17.924 --> 02:49:22.005]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:49:22.265 --> 02:49:25.746]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:49:26.246 --> 02:49:28.147]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:49:28.487 --> 02:49:32.388]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:49:46.030 --> 02:49:49.594]  Do you know where the 78 potentially active volcanoes in the U.S.
[02:49:49.634 --> 02:49:50.135]  are located?
[02:49:50.355 --> 02:49:53.760]  And do you know the locations of the top 300 prime terrorist targets?

[02:50:47.125 --> 02:50:47.466]  I think so.
[02:51:02.427 --> 02:51:03.028]  I think so.
[02:51:22.671 --> 02:51:25.232]  Welcome back ladies and gentlemen to our final segment.
[02:51:54.920 --> 02:51:57.363]  Adam, continuing with the point you were making, go ahead.
[02:51:58.584 --> 02:52:20.383]  Well, I just... I had done some research here in the last couple of days on Jim's website, and I know that part of the argument that he's making is, of course, there are a lot of misnomers and falsehoods in the conspiracy movement, and... Well, let me just try to answer your question, then.
[02:52:21.465 --> 02:52:24.829]  I think everybody's allowed to have their own ideas, their own views about this.
[02:52:24.949 --> 02:52:30.536]  Other than the no-plane crowd that thinks no planes at Tower 1 and 2, I think that is really perpetrated by operatives.
[02:52:31.272 --> 02:52:35.654]  And needs to be totally, you know, thrown in the ditch by those of us in the movement.
[02:52:35.954 --> 02:52:38.295]  But I think Dave's done some good research, done a lot of great work.
[02:52:38.335 --> 02:52:44.457]  I think that, you know, he found a few little mistakes in his film and in his final director's cut corrected those.
[02:52:44.517 --> 02:52:45.357]  I think it's a good film.
[02:52:45.997 --> 02:52:47.878]  And, you know, Hoffman, I think he's done some good work too.
[02:52:47.918 --> 02:52:51.079]  He's extremely conservative in his views on 9-11.
[02:52:51.099 --> 02:52:52.660]  I think he thinks that's the best way to approach it.
[02:52:52.880 --> 02:52:55.361]  But I'm not here to throw stones at him either, sir.
[02:52:55.501 --> 02:52:58.442]  So I would just say, enjoy your event and I appreciate your call.
[02:52:58.482 --> 02:52:58.842]  Anything else?
[02:52:59.874 --> 02:53:00.875]  No, that'll take care of it.
[02:53:00.935 --> 02:53:01.435]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:53:01.655 --> 02:53:02.716]  Thank you, I appreciate it.
[02:53:02.736 --> 02:53:09.139]  I mean, there's a lot of people who try to say, this is how the movement's supposed to run, and I'm the boss, and this is the way it's going to be done.
[02:53:09.639 --> 02:53:12.280]  We're in such desperate straits, we shouldn't spend our time doing that.
[02:53:12.300 --> 02:53:13.921]  Okay, we know it's an inside job.
[02:53:14.261 --> 02:53:16.562]  That evidence, we know the official story is a lie in the end.
[02:53:17.223 --> 02:53:19.744]  We can debate little intricacies all day long.
[02:53:19.784 --> 02:53:20.384]  We don't need to.
[02:53:20.404 --> 02:53:22.865]  We need to move forward with the basic facts.
[02:53:22.945 --> 02:53:26.627]  And what most filmmakers don't focus on is the history of government-sponsored terror.
[02:53:27.007 --> 02:53:27.888]  That is what I do.
[02:53:29.069 --> 02:53:48.202]  Well, I would say for people out there who up to this point have been hesitant and now have wanted to do something but haven't known how to approach it, and I hear so many calls to that effect on your show all the time, I would say
[02:53:49.008 --> 02:53:49.268]  Hey Alex!
[02:54:18.410 --> 02:54:22.852]  You know, it sounds like your excellent guest, Phil Stevens, is a real keeper for Austin.
[02:54:25.112 --> 02:54:29.474]  By the way, yesterday you had another excellent Austinite guest, Phil George Humphrey.
[02:54:30.154 --> 02:54:30.774]  Absolutely.
[02:54:31.255 --> 02:54:31.975]  You sure did.
[02:54:33.755 --> 02:54:43.499]  You know, that causes me to wonder, I'm noticing a convergence, almost a harmonic convergence of real freedom fighters here in Central Texas.
[02:54:45.342 --> 02:54:47.083]  Jim, that's definitely what's happening.
[02:54:47.143 --> 02:54:48.083]  I've got to let you go there.
[02:54:48.103 --> 02:54:49.023]  We're flat out of time.
[02:54:50.003 --> 02:54:51.544]  Stephen Conner, thank you for coming in.

[02:55:17.864 --> 02:55:19.024]  It's the best film I've ever made.
