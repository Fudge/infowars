[00:00:05.653 --> 00:00:06.293]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.954 --> 00:00:08.015]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.735 --> 00:00:09.836]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.497 --> 00:00:11.318]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.058 --> 00:00:12.939]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:17.303]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.824 --> 00:00:21.867]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:30.857 --> 00:00:33.860]  It is Wednesday, the 26th day of July, 2006.
[00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:37.503]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:00:37.523 --> 00:00:40.425]  We had him on for about a half hour last week.
[00:00:41.186 --> 00:00:51.755]  Michael Papantonio, and he's really the main owner of Air America, has a show there on the broadcast with Mr. Kennedy Jr.,
[00:00:54.093 --> 00:00:54.773]  And he joined us.
[00:00:54.953 --> 00:01:05.137]  He's the main lawyer who went after Bayer and got their own documents where they were knowingly putting AIDS and hepatitis-filled pathogens into the factor VIII for hemophiliacs globally.
[00:01:05.857 --> 00:01:18.662]  Well, today he's going to be coming on to talk about election fraud here in the United States and all the clear evidence of it with Diebold and others are up to in the second hour.
[00:01:20.419 --> 00:01:24.121]  And clearly the election fraud is controlled by the Republicans at this time.
[00:01:24.181 --> 00:01:26.942]  I'm not saying go run vote for Democrats either.
[00:01:26.982 --> 00:01:34.045]  We're just here facing the facts, covering the information as it truly is.
[00:01:34.866 --> 00:01:46.691]  Then in the third hour, Dr. Doug Rockey, the former head of the Army's DU Depleted Uranium Program, will be joining us with the evidence of Israel receiving shipments from the U.S.
[00:01:46.751 --> 00:01:46.791]  of
[00:01:47.526 --> 00:01:47.906]  I think?
[00:02:11.966 --> 00:02:15.389]  From the radiation detectors, and we know what the wind patterns are.
[00:02:15.869 --> 00:02:26.118]  And, of course, our own government used the equivalent of 44,000 A-bombs in Iraq and Afghanistan, in the two Iraq conflicts, and, of course, in Afghanistan.
[00:02:26.138 --> 00:02:29.841]  They're still using it, the numbers of 44,000 A-bombs.
[00:02:29.881 --> 00:02:32.183]  That is a two-and-a-half-year-old number.
[00:02:32.203 --> 00:02:34.004]  I'm told it's much worse.
[00:02:34.065 --> 00:02:38.028]  We can ask Dr. Doug Rockey, coming up in the third hour, about that as well.
[00:02:40.242 --> 00:02:42.863]  In the meantime, we will have open phones for you.
[00:02:44.023 --> 00:02:46.304]  And we'll have open phones for those two guests to join us.
[00:02:47.164 --> 00:02:54.106]  At the same time, the CDC, Centers for Disease Control, considers Texas for Morgellons Disease Study.
[00:02:54.647 --> 00:02:57.988]  This out of KENS5 Television.
[00:02:58.448 --> 00:02:59.348]  Get into that report.
[00:02:59.908 --> 00:03:06.310]  Of course, Israel bomb kills four UN observers and others who were in the building in Lebanon.
[00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:08.691]  Kofi Annan calls it a deliberate act.
[00:03:09.375 --> 00:03:15.481]  Meanwhile, have you seen the video of Condoleezza Rice in the meetings the last few days, the Lebanese leader and others?
[00:03:15.861 --> 00:03:18.644]  She's smiling, laughing, giggling, snickering.
[00:03:18.704 --> 00:03:20.846]  She acts like she just won the lottery.
[00:03:20.886 --> 00:03:25.951]  That's her body language, just radiant, fun, just like William Crystal and the rest of them.
[00:03:26.992 --> 00:03:29.354]  This just isn't how you act when you're in a war.
[00:03:29.614 --> 00:03:32.357]  No one ever has in the past, unless you're talking about
[00:03:33.118 --> 00:03:33.959]  Well, no kidding it is.
[00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:34.639]  Also, 30 soldiers hurt in...
[00:04:01.312 --> 00:04:04.873]  Just one village alone that the Israelis have gone into.
[00:04:04.893 --> 00:04:10.715]  And other reports that 14 Israeli soldiers have been killed by Hezbollah just in the last few days.
[00:04:11.375 --> 00:04:13.836]  And no one knows how many Lebanese.
[00:04:13.896 --> 00:04:15.656]  I mean, the number was 400 a week ago.
[00:04:15.676 --> 00:04:18.417]  And they're still trying to keep the number down at that level.
[00:04:18.457 --> 00:04:20.258]  But, I mean, they're bombing Beirut.
[00:04:20.278 --> 00:04:21.638]  They're bombing southern villages.
[00:04:21.678 --> 00:04:23.139]  They're bombing the north.
[00:04:23.179 --> 00:04:26.199]  They're blowing up convoys of Red Cross vehicles.
[00:04:26.239 --> 00:04:28.060]  There's video of it.
[00:04:28.857 --> 00:04:31.998]  Up on prisonplanet.com and infowars.com.
[00:04:32.338 --> 00:04:34.699]  Israel wants to, quote, set Hezbollah free zone.
[00:04:34.739 --> 00:04:37.140]  That means grab half of Lebanon, basically.
[00:04:38.081 --> 00:04:41.402]  And we will also get into the American Union.
[00:04:41.522 --> 00:04:42.963]  Big breaking news on that.
[00:04:43.323 --> 00:04:45.984]  Lou Dobbs says, why is the president ignoring our laws?
[00:04:48.505 --> 00:04:52.527]  And we've got a new New American article out on the American Union as well.
[00:04:54.258 --> 00:04:57.801]  A ton of vital news and information straight ahead in your calls.
[00:04:58.381 --> 00:05:00.483]  Stay with us.
[00:05:04.485 --> 00:05:07.668]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[00:05:08.008 --> 00:05:09.949]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:17.895]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:05:18.666 --> 00:05:25.690]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:37.537]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iraq, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:05:37.837 --> 00:05:41.339]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:05:41.799 --> 00:05:43.720]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:05:44.061 --> 00:05:47.903]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:06:02.745 --> 00:06:03.805]  The war on terrorism.
[00:06:04.125 --> 00:06:06.906]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[00:06:07.166 --> 00:06:11.327]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[00:06:11.747 --> 00:06:12.587]  So what do you do?
[00:06:12.907 --> 00:06:17.448]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:20.071]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[00:06:20.571 --> 00:06:35.257]  Sheltering in Place, surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:06:35.317 --> 00:06:42.439]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.

[00:07:01.448 --> 00:07:03.791]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here with an important question.
[00:07:04.031 --> 00:07:06.073]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[00:07:06.233 --> 00:07:13.261]  I mean real hard to find all natural pure soap that contains no dyes, perfumes, deodorants, detergents, or other dangerous toxins.
[00:07:13.541 --> 00:07:22.090]  The Calvin Pure Soap Company, for the past 57 years, has been making triple concentrated pure soaps exclusively for healthcare professionals and hospitals.
[00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:27.134]  Now for the first time, Calbin Pure Soap is available factory direct to you and your family.
[00:07:27.274 --> 00:07:31.318]  That's great news because Calbin Pure Soap is made from all natural ingredients.
[00:07:31.518 --> 00:07:33.940]  It's earth-friendly and completely environmentally safe.
[00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:38.564]  So if you want yesterday's values today for good old-fashioned pure soap, call 1-800-340-7091.
[00:07:41.707 --> 00:07:42.787]  Ease the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:07:42.808 --> 00:07:44.248]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:11.139 --> 00:08:22.111]  Alright, we're going to plunge into the latest Middle East developments as Israel rampages, attacking their neighbors, the bombing of the UN outpost, killing four deliberately.
[00:08:22.131 --> 00:08:29.078]  We've got video and audio and photos of them blowing up ambulances with extreme prejudice and pleasure.
[00:08:30.484 --> 00:08:34.165]  You imagine Hezbollah's blown up Israeli ambulances.
[00:08:34.205 --> 00:08:35.185]  They're so evil.
[00:08:35.245 --> 00:08:37.206]  And that is evil when they do stuff like that.
[00:08:37.266 --> 00:08:38.826]  Again, I'm not saying Hezbollah's perfect.
[00:08:39.146 --> 00:08:46.608]  I'm just tired of Israel standing around like they're just pure as a driven snow and they're the little guy when they've got the fifth biggest military in the world.
[00:08:47.708 --> 00:08:48.629]  Okay, I'm digressing.
[00:08:49.849 --> 00:08:50.629]  That's coming up.
[00:08:50.809 --> 00:08:52.030]  We've got two big guests today.
[00:08:52.090 --> 00:08:55.010]  Dr. Doug Rockey, third hour, about DU being used by the Israelis.
[00:08:55.670 --> 00:08:57.331]  We also have Michael Papantonio.
[00:08:58.064 --> 00:09:00.925]  I'm going to be debuting my new film Terror Storm coming up in Dallas.
[00:09:00.945 --> 00:09:02.405]  That is the official completed film.
[00:09:27.648 --> 00:09:28.429]  We're good to go.
[00:09:28.449 --> 00:09:29.349]  We're good to go.
[00:09:56.129 --> 00:10:02.713]  I'm going to be up there near my old stomping grounds, we could say, at the beautiful Lakewood Theater.
[00:10:02.813 --> 00:10:09.138]  I love old Paramount-style Art Deco movie theaters.
[00:10:09.178 --> 00:10:14.801]  It is the only stand-alone, one-screen theater left in Dallas.
[00:10:14.881 --> 00:10:15.602]  It is beautiful.
[00:10:16.585 --> 00:10:17.145]  It can seat 800.
[00:10:17.245 --> 00:10:18.885]  It can really seat 900.
[00:10:19.506 --> 00:10:21.246]  But I don't want people to be cramped.
[00:10:21.806 --> 00:10:26.487]  So we're going to space it out where there's only going to be 700 tickets sold.
[00:10:27.267 --> 00:10:28.847]  And tickets are not for sale yet.
[00:10:30.147 --> 00:10:31.868]  But believe me, it will sell out.
[00:10:31.928 --> 00:10:44.090]  And so by tomorrow or Friday, the latest, we will have links up on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com so you can go and get tickets.
[00:10:44.170 --> 00:10:45.790]  And who's going to be there?
[00:10:46.616 --> 00:10:57.222]  I'm going to show the 113-minute final cut of Terror Storm, and then I'm going to give about a 30-minute speech and take questions for about 20 minutes.
[00:10:57.842 --> 00:11:03.925]  And then Jim Mars, who actually is the main writer for the film JFK, my favorite movie.
[00:11:03.945 --> 00:11:04.986]  You ought to see the director's cut.
[00:11:05.006 --> 00:11:05.546]  It's incredible.
[00:11:05.966 --> 00:11:07.087]  I just keep ranting about it.
[00:11:07.147 --> 00:11:07.587]  It's so good.
[00:11:07.627 --> 00:11:14.391]  He joins us tomorrow to play clips of the film and talk about it and talk about how he basically wrote the screenplay with Oliver Stone.
[00:11:15.279 --> 00:11:22.044]  We'll go through some of the new things that have come out about the assassination of JFK by the military-industrial complex and Cold War warriors.
[00:11:23.325 --> 00:11:27.548]  Jim Mars will speak for an hour and take questions and answer them.
[00:11:29.129 --> 00:11:40.437]  And then I'm going to air about 35-45 minutes, a rough cut of some of what you'll see probably six months from now in my big Bilderberg group film that I'm going to be making.
[00:11:41.137 --> 00:11:42.718]  I mean, the film is in development right now.
[00:11:42.738 --> 00:11:43.759]  I haven't even started making it.
[00:11:44.415 --> 00:11:58.402]  But we're going to put together here in the next month a rough cut of some of the best stuff, some of the best interviews of the police threatening to arrest us, of us being detained, of the different things that happened while I was up in Ottawa June 8th, 9th, and 10th of last month.
[00:12:03.018 --> 00:12:18.043]  So, then we're going to play that, and then I believe we're going to have a great kind of lounge act, which is, you know, he even plays big outfits in Las Vegas, and they just do a great job, they're anti-New World Order, and that's Shanghai Five.
[00:12:18.623 --> 00:12:25.625]  Jim Mars is confirmed, my film is confirmed to be playing there, and the Bilderberg Group, that's going to be there, the footage of that.
[00:12:26.125 --> 00:12:26.706]  We're good to go.
[00:12:26.926 --> 00:12:27.707]  We're good to go.
[00:12:44.617 --> 00:13:00.651]  About 1,150 tickets, and we cut it off about a week before the 9-11 symposium because I knew we'd have about 50 guests and 50 media or so, and the place was only rated for around 1,200, so the fire marshal wouldn't let us sell more tickets, basically.
[00:13:01.594 --> 00:13:07.097]  And the last week, in one day, I think the toll-free number had over 300 requests.
[00:13:07.557 --> 00:13:09.778]  We had hundreds of emails, people trying to get tickets.
[00:13:10.218 --> 00:13:12.679]  We could have easily sold another thousand tickets or so.
[00:13:13.119 --> 00:13:14.920]  There in the last week, everybody waited.
[00:13:14.940 --> 00:13:26.285]  Then we had hundreds of people that showed up wanting to get in who couldn't because the fire marshal was there and who were hopping mad because they thought they could buy tickets at the door.
[00:13:26.972 --> 00:13:32.717]  You will not be able to buy tickets at the door for this event in Dallas, and we're only going to sell 700.
[00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:50.132]  The theater with theater seating seats 900, but there's some obstructions in the upper balcony, so we're just going to block off those seats and not sell them because I want it to be a good experience for everybody, and we're going to have a bigger stage out there and everything.
[00:13:50.172 --> 00:13:51.554]  So it's...
[00:13:52.498 --> 00:13:53.599]  I'm already belaboring it.
[00:13:54.079 --> 00:13:59.761]  It's just, believe me, as soon as these tickets go up for sale tomorrow or Friday, you better snatch them.
[00:14:00.181 --> 00:14:05.023]  If you're planning to bring friends and family, you better get them, because it will sell out.
[00:14:05.063 --> 00:14:18.509]  I mean, I've had, I don't know, I haven't counted them up, 40, 50, 60, I don't know, events over the last, I think I've had more than that, over the last six, seven years, and we've had one event, one event,
[00:14:20.709 --> 00:14:25.352]  In a big theater that I don't know held like 400 people in Houston where the theater was 80% filled.
[00:14:26.152 --> 00:14:30.015]  We've had one event where maybe 30 seats weren't filled.
[00:14:31.136 --> 00:14:37.299]  Every other event, I mean I've had events where it's a theater that holds 250 and 200 and something people get turned away.
[00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:38.980]  And that's always exciting.
[00:14:39.020 --> 00:14:41.802]  It's great to know that the word's getting out there.
[00:14:41.822 --> 00:14:44.464]  People are aware that this is happening.
[00:14:44.978 --> 00:14:49.639]  And then you can already buy tickets for, I'm going to have five showings and five showings only.
[00:14:49.999 --> 00:14:52.760]  I've had as many as nine before, all sellouts in a row.
[00:14:53.380 --> 00:14:59.082]  But I'll be at every event and give a speech and take questions and comments at the end of Terror Storm in September.
[00:14:59.542 --> 00:15:01.262]  The 4th, 5th, and 6th.
[00:15:02.002 --> 00:15:04.503]  And then I may be going to New York after that, so we're not having any that week.
[00:15:04.523 --> 00:15:08.104]  And when I get back, we're going to have it on the, what is it, the...
[00:15:08.866 --> 00:15:11.727]  13th, 14th, and 15th, isn't it?
[00:15:11.767 --> 00:15:12.387]  No, 13th and 14th.
[00:15:12.407 --> 00:15:19.368]  So there's five showings of that, and you can go to the Alamo Draft House South Lamar online and get those tickets, and it always sells out.
[00:15:19.428 --> 00:15:22.289]  Sometimes a week and a half before, normally two days before.
[00:15:22.669 --> 00:15:25.830]  So every event has sold out that I've ever had except one.
[00:15:25.850 --> 00:15:31.091]  All right, I meant to spend a minute and a half on this, and I've already spent four minutes on it.
[00:15:31.171 --> 00:15:34.131]  Let me now plunge into the news.
[00:15:34.211 --> 00:15:37.812]  But again, tickets are available right now at the Alamo Draft House for the September showings.
[00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:41.500]  We're to start.
[00:15:41.981 --> 00:15:51.146]  Before I get into the new developments in Israel, I'm sure most of you already know all of the details, but I'll comment on and recap what's been happening in the last 24 hours.
[00:15:51.306 --> 00:15:52.707]  Really serious escalation.
[00:15:53.447 --> 00:16:03.193]  Israel is now openly talking about going all the way to northern Lebanon, grabbing a third or half the country, which will trigger, Syria has said, their coming into the war.
[00:16:04.268 --> 00:16:16.434]  And this all coincides with Bush saying he has an ultimatum for Iran, and neocons all over radio, TV, and the newspapers saying we need to go ahead and attack Iran, Israeli leaders saying that, that we need to go ahead and attack Iran so they don't have to.
[00:16:16.915 --> 00:16:29.121]  This is all a provocation to basically get the war drums beating full speed so that we'll all get into kind of tribal mode and get behind our, quote, leader, George W., the chicken hawk.
[00:16:31.872 --> 00:16:33.878]  And I've always been critical of Israel.
[00:16:34.179 --> 00:16:40.196]  But a lot of people try to say Israel is the source of all evil on planet Earth.
[00:16:42.105 --> 00:16:46.566]  And the crowd that seems to think this, more often than not, admires Adolf Hitler.
[00:16:47.086 --> 00:16:48.666]  And I don't like Adolf Hitler.
[00:16:48.686 --> 00:16:57.268]  He's a very evil, occultic individual set up by the globalists and the owners of IBM and the Bushes and the British royalty and many others.
[00:16:57.328 --> 00:16:58.489]  And that's just historical fact.
[00:16:58.509 --> 00:17:03.410]  We have the official newspaper article from the 40s and the official Library of Congress documents.
[00:17:05.150 --> 00:17:09.351]  But, I mean, I've always criticized Israel and its racist policies of
[00:17:10.006 --> 00:17:14.089]  You're arrested if you try to marry a Jew and you're not Jewish over there.
[00:17:15.070 --> 00:17:16.391]  I mean, that's pretty darn racist.
[00:17:16.451 --> 00:17:17.632]  I don't know how that's acceptable.
[00:17:17.832 --> 00:17:24.797]  Or Christians aren't allowed to proselytize or hand out tracts or have church meetings anywhere in Israel.
[00:17:25.117 --> 00:17:33.724]  And then how the so-called evangelicals, who are anything but Christian, how they can say, praise the Lord, that's wonderful of Israel, which they do.
[00:17:33.824 --> 00:17:36.726]  I've seen them and read them defending it.
[00:17:38.374 --> 00:17:51.565]  My point is that it's more effective to criticize Israel for the bad things they're doing than to basically come at it from an anti-Semitic angle, which a lot of people do.
[00:17:53.766 --> 00:17:54.967]  I mean, you've all heard it.
[00:17:55.087 --> 00:17:56.689]  Jews are inherently evil.
[00:17:56.769 --> 00:17:58.150]  They're the devil's seed.
[00:17:59.211 --> 00:17:59.792]  All of this.
[00:17:59.972 --> 00:18:01.493]  And I do not hold with that.
[00:18:01.553 --> 00:18:02.614]  I have a lot of Jewish friends.
[00:18:02.654 --> 00:18:03.775]  They're all anti-war.
[00:18:04.095 --> 00:18:05.517]  They're totally against what's happening.
[00:18:05.797 --> 00:18:07.198]  They call Israel racist.
[00:18:08.699 --> 00:18:11.942]  In major polls, what, 60% of the Jews were against what the government was doing.
[00:18:12.342 --> 00:18:14.824]  Now they've gotten into tribal mode, just like Americans do.
[00:18:15.625 --> 00:18:19.829]  And the vast majority now are for what's happening, because they're getting hit by the Katyusha rockets.
[00:18:21.410 --> 00:18:26.134]  But there are a lot of refuseniks and others that aren't going along with what's happening.
[00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:30.464]  I do not want to go to war with Syria.
[00:18:45.805 --> 00:18:46.285]  We're good to go.
[00:18:46.305 --> 00:18:46.866]  We're good to go.
[00:19:11.928 --> 00:19:24.174]  We'll probably, it's a good chance, stage a terror attack very soon in England, the U.S., or something massive in Israel as a pretext to then blame Iran or Syria and bring us into World War III.
[00:19:24.554 --> 00:19:29.656]  And I don't want to see hundreds of thousands of Americans die in this new expanding global war.
[00:19:30.337 --> 00:19:31.257]  They want World War III.
[00:19:31.297 --> 00:19:35.259]  That's the PNAC plan, to invade 66 countries.
[00:19:35.319 --> 00:19:38.220]  They've already invaded three of the 66 countries.
[00:19:42.009 --> 00:19:53.080]  And so, I'm trying to stop this in my own little feeble way, but together we may be able to, especially if we throw ourselves down in front of God and ask Him for forgiveness.
[00:19:54.242 --> 00:19:56.224]  And, well, it's just horrible.
[00:19:56.424 --> 00:19:57.905]  It's just totally horrible.
[00:19:57.925 --> 00:19:58.446]  We'll be right back.

[00:21:31.894 --> 00:21:32.754]  We're good to go.
[00:21:32.774 --> 00:21:33.274]  I think?
[00:22:01.641 --> 00:22:03.222]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:22:03.602 --> 00:22:09.346]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[00:22:09.607 --> 00:22:14.730]  The Berkey light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[00:22:15.070 --> 00:22:24.337]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, trihalomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.
[00:22:24.697 --> 00:22:29.661]  Its rechargeable 8-lamp bright white LED lighting system provides the ideal source of emergency light.
[00:22:29.981 --> 00:22:33.984]  The lights can run all night on a single charge, and it is bright enough to read by.
[00:22:34.184 --> 00:22:38.948]  This provides a relaxing and ambient night light that allows for optimum use during emergency conditions.
[00:22:39.328 --> 00:22:45.153]  The Berkey Light's revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.
[00:22:45.573 --> 00:22:51.778]  Get the Berkey Light, the standard of excellence for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.

[00:23:01.644 --> 00:23:08.427]  The Bill of Rights is a term for the first ten amendments of the Constitution, limiting the federal government's power and preserving the rights of the people.
[00:23:08.887 --> 00:23:11.868]  Each day, we gradually lose these rights that we are entitled to.
[00:23:12.188 --> 00:23:16.130]  We need to take a stand to let the government know that we are tired of losing our rights.
[00:23:16.470 --> 00:23:18.071]  Today, you can take this stand.
[00:23:18.371 --> 00:23:23.573]  You can express your beliefs by wearing a new and innovative t-shirt available only through GCN.
[00:23:23.993 --> 00:23:29.555]  Each shirt is black, with a redesign of the famous Don't Tread on Me Gaston flag located on the front of the shirt.

[00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:12.641]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:24:12.661 --> 00:24:14.262]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:17.223 --> 00:24:23.046]  I've seen too many videos of Israelis running over people, peaceful people, Americans.
[00:24:24.574 --> 00:24:24.974]  I think?
[00:24:38.766 --> 00:24:40.627]  The entire world in World War III.
[00:24:40.667 --> 00:24:46.871]  So the oil companies get to grab all the oil and basically restrict the flow of oil to jack up prices.
[00:24:46.911 --> 00:24:54.435]  So the defense contractors get to sell hundreds of billions of dollars a year in increased weapons sales and no-bid contracts.
[00:24:54.495 --> 00:25:00.758]  And so Israel gets to widen its landmass, gets to expand its borders.
[00:25:00.798 --> 00:25:03.300]  And that's in the State of the Pentagon and in Israeli documents.
[00:25:04.741 --> 00:25:05.261]  It's wrong.
[00:25:06.301 --> 00:25:17.757]  But it is indeed happening, and the globalists know that when they're in the middle of a war, their approval ratings go back up, and they're able to move forward with the final part of their plan, domestic police states in the Western world.
[00:25:19.058 --> 00:25:20.861]  As you know, Israel has bombed.
[00:25:21.870 --> 00:25:24.552]  And killed four UN observers at least.
[00:25:25.092 --> 00:25:26.974]  They have bombed UN sites before.
[00:25:26.994 --> 00:25:32.657]  They knowingly, with a pinpoint strike, hit the facility.
[00:25:33.038 --> 00:25:38.221]  An Israeli airstrike yesterday hit a UN base in southern Lebanon, killing four United Nations observers.
[00:25:38.261 --> 00:25:42.684]  Lebanese security forces said Israel has now admitted it and said that they're, quote, investigating it.
[00:25:43.184 --> 00:25:44.246]  We're good to go.
[00:25:44.426 --> 00:25:45.006]  I think?
[00:26:04.258 --> 00:26:11.863]  Coffee Annan, Secretary General, has condemned the killing of four military observers in Lebanon by Israeli forces, calling it deliberate targeting.
[00:26:11.923 --> 00:26:20.188]  I am shocked and deeply distressed by the apparently deliberate targeting by Israeli defense forces of a UN observer post in southern Lebanon.
[00:26:20.208 --> 00:26:21.429]  Well, they're going into that village.
[00:26:21.469 --> 00:26:22.170]  They can't have the UNC.
[00:26:23.090 --> 00:26:25.132]  And slaughtering all the civilians, I would add.
[00:26:25.632 --> 00:26:32.837]  Anand said Tuesday in a statement from Rome where he is to attend a high-level international meeting on Lebanon today.
[00:26:33.257 --> 00:26:35.859]  And they're saying those talks are breaking down right now, by the way.
[00:26:36.399 --> 00:26:42.724]  He called the act a coordinated artillery and aerial attack on a long-established... Yeah, I got hit by multiple salvos.
[00:26:43.184 --> 00:26:45.865]  We hear many times that the Israelis attacked the USS Liberty in 1967.
[00:27:14.225 --> 00:27:15.251]  During the Six-Day Warb,
[00:27:16.773 --> 00:27:24.700]  Because that ship was picking up relayed information about an admitted massacre carried out by Ariel Saron of hundreds of civilians.
[00:27:25.201 --> 00:27:26.402]  But that really is a shill.
[00:27:26.462 --> 00:27:32.087]  The main operation was between our government and Israel, and I've talked to the admirals and JAG officers about this.
[00:27:32.187 --> 00:27:43.037]  They've got the evidence, and we've got the evidence in my film Terror Storm, that our government with Israel conspired to sink that ship and kill all aboard deployment on Egypt to start World War III back then.
[00:27:43.962 --> 00:27:46.905]  They just keep trying to do it, and they may succeed this time.
[00:27:47.745 --> 00:27:48.566]  It's really scary.
[00:27:49.046 --> 00:27:54.451]  I call on the government of Israel to conduct a full investigation into this very disturbing incident and demand that any further attack on U.N.
[00:27:54.471 --> 00:27:56.933]  positions and personnel must stop and instead.
[00:27:57.694 --> 00:28:02.037]  The names and nationalities of those killed are being withheld until family members can be notified.
[00:28:02.137 --> 00:28:03.659]  So we should learn soon.
[00:28:04.099 --> 00:28:06.201]  And again, it could be more than four dead.
[00:28:07.202 --> 00:28:08.523]  Very, very serious.
[00:28:09.847 --> 00:28:10.788]  Another report here.
[00:28:10.808 --> 00:28:12.989]  This is out of the Associated Press out of Beirut, Lebanon.
[00:28:13.029 --> 00:28:15.030]  Fourteen Israeli troops killed by Hezbollah.
[00:28:15.050 --> 00:28:24.835]  Hezbollah inflicted heavy casualties on Israeli troops as they battled for a key hilltop town in southern Lebanon for a fourth day today, Wednesday, with as many as 14 soldiers reported killed.
[00:28:24.855 --> 00:28:26.956]  Lebanese officials meanwhile confirmed that four U.N.
[00:28:26.976 --> 00:28:31.018]  observers were killed by an Israeli airstrike on their post Tuesday night.
[00:28:33.759 --> 00:28:35.280]  And, you know, we don't know.
[00:28:35.300 --> 00:28:39.342]  I'm sure some of these Israelis have been killed by Hezbollah and Hamas, but
[00:28:40.109 --> 00:28:46.971]  We also know that yesterday it was reported that an Israeli attack drone, armed drone, attacked Israeli forces.
[00:28:46.991 --> 00:28:53.292]  They claim no one was killed, but a lot of times friendly fire gets covered up and they claim that some enemy did it.
[00:28:53.332 --> 00:29:00.434]  It doesn't really matter in the final equation, but it's interesting to note that in the fog of war, it will take time to learn.
[00:29:01.591 --> 00:29:03.331]  It'll take time to get a clearer picture.
[00:29:03.371 --> 00:29:26.416]  We'll never probably have a completely crystal clear picture on this, only that Israel has taken normal occurrences, soldiers being captured, a few Katusha rockets being fired, that's always happening, and hyped it into full-scale war, and now our government's talking about attacking Iran and Syria, and Syria's stupidly talking about moving into southern Lebanon, moving into Lebanon, and it's just a powder keg.
[00:29:26.996 --> 00:29:29.797]  We'll come back, take calls, play a little four-minute news clip.
[00:29:30.507 --> 00:29:32.548]  Where ambulances are being attacked.
[00:29:33.148 --> 00:29:34.889]  Can't see the video, but you'll be able to hear the audio.
[00:29:34.909 --> 00:29:37.770]  The video's up on prisonplanet.com and infowars.com.
[00:29:37.910 --> 00:29:44.893]  And we'll get into a bunch of domestic police state news, some news on Morgellons, and a lot more on the other side.
[00:29:45.733 --> 00:29:46.233]  Stay with us.
[00:29:51.655 --> 00:29:52.536]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.036 --> 00:29:54.636]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.557 --> 00:29:58.238]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.366 --> 00:30:09.877]  According to a recent report by the National Institute of Health, high blood pressure is a major risk factor for heart disease and the chief risk factor for stroke and heart failure.
[00:30:10.118 --> 00:30:11.920]  It affects about 50 million Americans.
[00:30:12.140 --> 00:30:13.262]  That's one in four adults.
[00:30:13.649 --> 00:30:14.650]  To learn more about heart care.
[00:30:35.462 --> 00:30:40.805]  The widely researched natural herbal supplement for regulating blood pressure and maintaining optimum heart health.
[00:30:41.125 --> 00:30:47.208]  Did you know that the safety and effectiveness of heart care is backed by over 100 clinical trials and experimental studies?
[00:30:47.588 --> 00:30:48.028]  Act now.
[00:30:48.149 --> 00:30:54.232]  Visit us online at researchedherbs.com or call us at 1-800-845-3841 to start protecting yourself from the silent killer.
[00:30:54.452 --> 00:30:54.772]  That's 1-800-845-3841.
[00:31:01.670 --> 00:31:06.631]  Now you can bring Berkey Purification Power anywhere with the Sport Berkey Filtration Bottle.
[00:31:06.931 --> 00:31:12.373]  Ideal for sporting games, camping or boating, or Sport Berkey is small enough to store in your glove box.
[00:31:12.413 --> 00:31:16.714]  So it's ideal backup for unexpected emergencies like blackouts, floods or earthquakes.
[00:31:17.054 --> 00:31:20.055]  It's simply the best personal water filtration system available.
[00:31:20.375 --> 00:31:23.816]  So effective you can drink raw, untreated water from lakes, rivers and streams.
[00:31:24.136 --> 00:31:33.504]  Unlike other sport bottles, the Sport Berkey's patented filter formulation is so powerful it removes cysts, parasites, harmful bacteria, and chemicals like herbicides and pesticides.
[00:31:33.764 --> 00:31:37.247]  It even reduces radon-222, lead, and other heavy metals.
[00:31:37.508 --> 00:31:44.614]  This lightweight, rugged 22-ounce filter is small enough to go everywhere, so take one to work and keep another in your glove box for emergencies.
[00:31:44.874 --> 00:31:46.235]  Get the Berkey Sport for only $39.
[00:31:46.275 --> 00:31:47.997]  Get two for $70 by calling New Millennium at 888-
[00:31:51.560 --> 00:31:52.000]  803-4438.
[00:31:52.140 --> 00:31:54.403]  Order your Berkey Sport today.
[00:31:54.623 --> 00:31:57.206]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438 or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[00:32:00.845 --> 00:32:02.466]  I used to be ashamed of my toenails.
[00:32:02.566 --> 00:32:06.829]  I thought I was destined to wear tennis shoes through the heat of the summer and hide my toes at the beach.
[00:32:07.229 --> 00:32:09.911]  And then my podiatrist told me about Non-X Nail Gel.
[00:32:10.071 --> 00:32:14.674]  It tackles unsightly nails by clearing out the cause of the problem, yellowing keratin debris buildup.
[00:32:14.834 --> 00:32:19.658]  With regular use, Non-X Gel breaks down and removes the debris, so toenails look clear.
[00:32:19.838 --> 00:32:24.581]  This summer, I'm wearing open-toed sandals again, thanks to a topical natural gel called Non-X.
[00:32:24.801 --> 00:32:27.483]  If your toenails are embarrassing, I recommend Non-X Nail Gel.
[00:32:27.703 --> 00:32:30.585]  It's at your pharmacy or mass retailer in the foot care section.
[00:32:31.886 --> 00:32:32.886]  Looking for profit?
[00:32:32.966 --> 00:32:34.347]  Looking for safety and security?
[00:32:34.787 --> 00:32:37.889]  The $10 Olympic commemorative gold coin offered both.
[00:32:37.929 --> 00:32:45.494]  This low-mintage collector coin with a total series mintage under $600,000 has sold at four times its current price.
[00:32:45.554 --> 00:32:49.136]  Falling dollar values and inflation make this likely to happen again.
[00:32:49.316 --> 00:32:50.837]  Secure your position today.
[00:32:51.137 --> 00:32:52.378]  Call Midas Resources at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:32:52.418 --> 00:32:52.638]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:33:23.527 --> 00:33:33.971]  Dr. Doug Rockey, former head of the Army's program on depleting uranium, will be joining us in the third hour of this live Wednesday edition, 26th day of July 2006.
[00:33:34.051 --> 00:33:38.772]  We've got Mike Papantonio joining us to talk about election fraud.
[00:33:38.812 --> 00:33:42.634]  In the second hour, we'll have open phones on that subject coming up.
[00:33:43.534 --> 00:33:45.174]  And we'll go to your calls here in just a moment.
[00:33:46.955 --> 00:33:50.796]  Before I go any further, let me just tell you some of the other news that's coming up.
[00:33:50.856 --> 00:33:52.297]  Lou Dobbs has written a great editorial.
[00:33:53.257 --> 00:33:56.058]  Why is the President ignoring our laws?
[00:33:56.258 --> 00:34:01.420]  This on the heels of the American Bar Association coming out and just saying, this President is completely lawless.
[00:34:01.460 --> 00:34:05.681]  He just violates federal laws every day, in every way, across the board.
[00:34:05.701 --> 00:34:07.762]  It has nothing to do, quote, with national security.
[00:34:07.782 --> 00:34:10.443]  See, it starts with, oh, we break the law for national security.
[00:34:10.463 --> 00:34:12.763]  And then, oh, we break the law for campaign finance.
[00:34:12.823 --> 00:34:15.324]  Oh, and oh, we break the law for, we do whatever we want.
[00:34:15.704 --> 00:34:18.245]  We write the law just by statements the President makes.
[00:34:18.285 --> 00:34:20.446]  He doesn't even, it's crazy.
[00:34:22.522 --> 00:34:26.564]  Also, big reports out here on NAFTA.
[00:34:26.944 --> 00:34:29.026]  This is an article written by Paul Watson.
[00:34:29.066 --> 00:34:31.127]  We have links to the actual documents on the U.S.
[00:34:31.167 --> 00:34:32.227]  government's own websites.
[00:34:32.767 --> 00:34:36.349]  NAFTA Superhighway RFID card for U.S.
[00:34:36.449 --> 00:34:36.990]  citizens.
[00:34:37.050 --> 00:34:44.233]  Trusted Traveler Toll Road System means government will decide if and where you are allowed to travel.
[00:34:45.414 --> 00:34:46.334]  And it gets into this.
[00:34:46.695 --> 00:34:50.777]  And this will instantly legalize all the Mexicans and all the Canadians to come into the U.S.
[00:34:50.857 --> 00:34:51.257]  unabated.
[00:34:52.768 --> 00:34:56.969]  Another article here by Kelly Taylor for the New American Magazine.
[00:34:56.989 --> 00:35:00.630]  And it says, Coming through the NAFTA superhighway.
[00:35:00.670 --> 00:35:01.951]  So that report's out today.
[00:35:02.671 --> 00:35:04.011]  Another one by Chuck Baldwin.
[00:35:04.051 --> 00:35:07.352]  President Bush continues to sell America to foreign interest.
[00:35:07.392 --> 00:35:08.673]  I want to get into all these reports.
[00:35:09.213 --> 00:35:11.633]  Another report from World Net Daily by Jerome Corsi.
[00:35:12.074 --> 00:35:14.894]  Feds finally release info on superstate.
[00:35:15.074 --> 00:35:19.116]  Asked to disclose details of plan that could form North American Union.
[00:35:19.416 --> 00:35:20.616]  That's what it is for me.
[00:35:22.193 --> 00:35:23.454]  Another scary article here.
[00:35:23.554 --> 00:35:25.454]  Judge dismisses phone records lawsuit.
[00:35:25.854 --> 00:35:29.236]  So what if AT&T records everything you do and gives it to the government without warrants?
[00:35:29.536 --> 00:35:31.477]  They're allowed to, the federal judge says.
[00:35:31.957 --> 00:35:33.037]  All part of the lawlessness.
[00:35:34.418 --> 00:35:36.719]  Another scary article out of the Telegraph.
[00:35:37.559 --> 00:35:44.062]  Pentagon declares war on Internet combat movies, and it's called snuff films by critics.
[00:35:44.362 --> 00:35:46.383]  That's what it is, them killing people and laughing about it.
[00:35:46.863 --> 00:35:49.624]  The Pentagon's telling the troops, hey, quit releasing these.
[00:35:50.265 --> 00:35:51.045]  And what are the tapes?
[00:35:51.605 --> 00:35:59.707]  Abrams tanks with dead bodies tied to them, Abrams tanks with skulls mounted on them, 666 on helicopters, Satan spray painted on tanks.
[00:36:00.367 --> 00:36:02.827]  By the way, it is a large percentage of them that have this.
[00:36:03.287 --> 00:36:17.690]  Blaring heavy metal, slaughter music, murdering children, women, laughing, snickering, sitting off the sides of highways, shooting cars as they blow up and roll, people falling out dead on the street, whole families laughing, giggling, snickering.
[00:36:19.150 --> 00:36:20.993]  This is the type of stuff we post routinely.
[00:36:24.657 --> 00:36:25.318]  Oh, man.
[00:36:26.259 --> 00:36:28.342]  And the Pentagon's saying, please stop it.
[00:36:28.903 --> 00:36:30.165]  And, of course, this on the heels.
[00:36:32.287 --> 00:36:33.269]  Well, I said I'd go to your calls.
[00:36:33.309 --> 00:36:34.410]  I'll get to it later if I have time.
[00:36:34.450 --> 00:36:34.871]  It's just that
[00:36:35.518 --> 00:36:43.465]  Remember, we went and dug out the Ithaca Journal article from 2002 where the Army soldiers are saying, yeah, we're ordered to kill all women and children in villages.
[00:36:43.746 --> 00:36:44.967]  We just kill everyone.
[00:36:44.987 --> 00:36:47.509]  And the Pentagon goes, well, let us clarify.
[00:36:47.529 --> 00:36:53.214]  Yes, only in certain areas where there are combatants, we do kill everyone with ground troops up close.
[00:36:53.975 --> 00:36:54.756]  Total crime.
[00:36:55.556 --> 00:36:56.257]  Totally evil.
[00:36:57.122 --> 00:37:02.963]  And then the mainstream America out there denies it and rationalizes it and says it isn't going on.
[00:37:03.443 --> 00:37:10.545]  When there's videos, admissions, all of this, and now a bunch of troops at the government, the Pentagon, are indicting.
[00:37:10.965 --> 00:37:13.645]  The Army is indicting them up on charges.
[00:37:13.665 --> 00:37:15.766]  They're going, wait a minute, we were ordered to kill all males.
[00:37:18.506 --> 00:37:21.127]  Then you've got the other extreme of the neocons.
[00:37:21.147 --> 00:37:23.067]  They're like, good, yeah, kill them all.
[00:37:24.328 --> 00:37:26.288]  Van in Texas, shirt on the air, welcome.
[00:37:26.991 --> 00:37:27.772]  How you doing, Alex?
[00:37:28.392 --> 00:37:32.355]  I've been listening to you for quite a while.
[00:37:32.415 --> 00:37:35.257]  Thank you for all the information that you provide us.
[00:37:35.397 --> 00:37:41.262]  I wanted to find out if here in Austin, if you're aware of the fact that they are spraying chemicals at night?
[00:37:42.734 --> 00:37:43.694]  It's usually like that.
[00:37:43.734 --> 00:37:47.196]  Yeah, I don't really watch hardly any television.
[00:37:47.216 --> 00:37:50.397]  I watch clips online of TV, but I do listen to some radio quite a bit.
[00:37:50.418 --> 00:37:55.680]  And I constantly hear little announcements that there's this new moth, there's this new beetle.
[00:37:57.020 --> 00:38:04.504]  Mainly in my neighborhood, the last three announcements I heard, the planes are flying around spraying us, and they said they do it at about 3 a.m.
[00:38:04.564 --> 00:38:05.304]  Is that what you've been hearing?
[00:38:05.744 --> 00:38:06.805]  Oh, they do it earlier than that.
[00:38:06.845 --> 00:38:09.026]  I've seen it as early as 9 o'clock p.m.
[00:38:09.830 --> 00:38:15.433]  But I don't see any difference from that than the chemical, the way it looks during the daytime.
[00:38:15.913 --> 00:38:19.395]  And it's usually clear at night when they're spraying.
[00:38:19.415 --> 00:38:20.576]  Well, let me ask you something.
[00:38:20.596 --> 00:38:23.057]  Are you talking about high altitude, what we call chemtrails?
[00:38:23.317 --> 00:38:24.318]  Yeah.
[00:38:24.518 --> 00:38:29.541]  Or are you talking about the announcements all over Austin News and fixed-wing aircraft spraying pesticides on us?
[00:38:30.021 --> 00:38:35.824]  It looks like about high altitude because they're spreading just like it does during the daytime when there's chemicals.
[00:38:36.966 --> 00:38:39.409]  When I see the chemtrails and stuff like that.
[00:38:39.849 --> 00:38:42.012]  Well, we had a big discussion about that a few days ago.
[00:38:42.052 --> 00:38:43.454]  Yeah, I was trying to call you.
[00:38:44.214 --> 00:38:48.159]  I wasn't able to make it on the line, I guess, because I called kind of late.
[00:38:48.179 --> 00:38:50.361]  Yeah, I mean, something has changed.
[00:38:50.442 --> 00:38:54.887]  Condensation trails in the past didn't stay up there four hours, and now they do.
[00:38:55.620 --> 00:38:59.041]  And now NASA says the atmosphere has changed and we're 20% darker.
[00:38:59.742 --> 00:39:04.624]  And again, satellite photos 20 years ago didn't show weird trails from space.
[00:39:04.644 --> 00:39:09.506]  Now the globe has just these trails everywhere, even satellite photos.
[00:39:09.926 --> 00:39:12.047]  And NASA says it's increased air travel.
[00:39:12.587 --> 00:39:19.550]  Well, you know, I've also noticed that it's not just... A lot of times it looks like they're making X's in the sky.
[00:39:19.997 --> 00:39:21.439]  You know, they're crossing one another.
[00:39:21.839 --> 00:39:23.761]  It's not like it's just a straight line.
[00:39:23.781 --> 00:39:26.464]  Well, I mean, I've seen it where there's a hundred of them in lines.
[00:39:26.684 --> 00:39:26.985]  Oh, yeah.
[00:39:27.105 --> 00:39:31.950]  I mean, there'll be a blue sky in the morning, and by afternoon it's just solid trails that never go away.
[00:39:31.970 --> 00:39:33.732]  And I'm just saying that didn't happen in the past.
[00:39:34.072 --> 00:39:34.653]  What's different?
[00:39:34.673 --> 00:39:35.314]  Thanks for the call.
[00:39:35.514 --> 00:39:35.794]  You're welcome.
[00:39:36.155 --> 00:39:36.955]  I appreciate it, man.
[00:39:37.416 --> 00:39:38.257]  Robert in Texas.
[00:39:38.317 --> 00:39:39.038]  Robert, go ahead.
[00:39:42.426 --> 00:39:43.347]  Going once, Robert.
[00:39:43.707 --> 00:39:44.407]  Hi, how are you?
[00:39:44.667 --> 00:39:45.468]  Good, go ahead.
[00:39:46.228 --> 00:39:52.251]  I want to thank you for three of my favorite films, Terror Storm, which I just got the autographed version.
[00:39:53.112 --> 00:39:57.074]  I got Martial Law 9-11, Rise of the Police State, and The Order of Death.
[00:39:58.014 --> 00:40:01.816]  And my best friend, Drew, turned me on to you.
[00:40:02.557 --> 00:40:03.777]  And I just want to tell you, it's great.
[00:40:03.797 --> 00:40:06.799]  And the only other thing I want to say is I hope to God we don't have World War III.
[00:40:08.288 --> 00:40:09.248]  I'm really worried about it.
[00:40:09.368 --> 00:40:12.109]  Watching this unfold, what is it like for you?
[00:40:12.489 --> 00:40:16.691]  Psychologically, what are the emotions you're feeling?
[00:40:19.252 --> 00:40:20.672]  Fear.
[00:40:20.692 --> 00:40:21.672]  I am Jewish.
[00:40:22.833 --> 00:40:26.754]  I've read a lot about Israel, but I think what they're doing is wrong.
[00:40:29.102 --> 00:40:30.523]  Well, I think what they're doing is wrong, too.
[00:40:30.743 --> 00:40:34.104]  And again, it isn't that we're against Israel or the Jewish people.
[00:40:34.164 --> 00:40:38.386]  I mean, I'm not against the American people when I'm against the war in Iraq.
[00:40:38.426 --> 00:40:45.069]  It's just these wars are staged provocations, and they're killing civilians with pleasure, and it's horrible.
[00:40:45.329 --> 00:40:45.829]  It is horrible.
[00:40:47.610 --> 00:40:48.050]  I don't know.
[00:40:48.110 --> 00:40:52.272]  You know, with Bush, you know, and his president, I realize he's a minion.
[00:40:52.992 --> 00:40:54.453]  It doesn't help things either, you know.
[00:40:57.498 --> 00:40:58.418]  No, it doesn't, my friend.
[00:40:58.458 --> 00:40:59.138]  Thank you for the call.
[00:40:59.178 --> 00:41:08.100]  And I want to thank your friend, Drew, who turned you on to reality, that gave you the red pill that dropped you down the rabbit hole, that threw a bucket of cold water on you.
[00:41:08.560 --> 00:41:10.220]  How many more clichés can I rattle off?
[00:41:11.020 --> 00:41:12.961]  Let's talk to Art in Kansas.
[00:41:13.081 --> 00:41:13.581]  Art, welcome.
[00:41:13.981 --> 00:41:14.541]  Hi, Alex.
[00:41:14.861 --> 00:41:15.061]  Hi.
[00:41:15.401 --> 00:41:20.682]  I find it ironic and atrocious that the old Holocaust bunch has become the new Nazis.
[00:41:21.022 --> 00:41:24.843]  They might as well put swastikas on all their Holocaust buildings.
[00:41:27.711 --> 00:41:34.175]  Well, last time I checked, they don't have million-man slave camps, but it's starting to get close.
[00:41:35.136 --> 00:41:35.656]  Close enough.
[00:41:36.436 --> 00:41:38.478]  Well, look at who our government loves and deals with.
[00:41:38.498 --> 00:41:40.579]  The Saudi Arabians, totally corrupt.
[00:41:40.679 --> 00:41:43.220]  The Chinese, totally corrupt.
[00:41:43.240 --> 00:41:44.241]  The Communist Chinese.
[00:41:44.981 --> 00:41:46.362]  The Israelis, totally corrupt.
[00:41:47.263 --> 00:41:49.084]  All these supposed free countries.
[00:41:49.424 --> 00:41:51.125]  England's becoming a police state.
[00:41:52.026 --> 00:41:53.487]  Europe's becoming a police state.
[00:41:53.807 --> 00:41:54.347]  The U.S.
[00:41:54.387 --> 00:41:55.608]  is becoming a police state.
[00:41:56.709 --> 00:41:57.369]  It's terrible.
[00:41:58.160 --> 00:41:58.460]  I know it.
[00:42:01.021 --> 00:42:01.901]  What else is on your mind?
[00:42:02.101 --> 00:42:02.521]  That's it.
[00:42:02.882 --> 00:42:03.862]  All right, good to hear from you.
[00:42:04.342 --> 00:42:06.223]  Let's talk to Tony in Arkansas.
[00:42:06.263 --> 00:42:06.983]  Tony, welcome.
[00:42:07.243 --> 00:42:10.124]  Hey, God bless you, Alex, for your steadfastness and courage.
[00:42:10.884 --> 00:42:11.644]  I wanted to come along.
[00:42:11.664 --> 00:42:12.305]  I didn't know if you heard it.
[00:42:12.325 --> 00:42:13.105]  I believe it was Monday.
[00:42:13.145 --> 00:42:14.946]  Condoleezza Rice flies into Beirut.
[00:42:15.206 --> 00:42:18.687]  Ironically enough, all the attacks stop her in Lebanon.
[00:42:18.767 --> 00:42:21.968]  She said something that I don't know if everybody picked up on.
[00:42:21.988 --> 00:42:25.189]  She said, we're watching the birth pangs of a new Middle East.
[00:42:26.138 --> 00:42:28.460]  And John Stewart put that on his show.
[00:42:28.941 --> 00:42:32.444]  Well, what that is, is that is actual scripture.
[00:42:32.605 --> 00:42:32.985]  Thank you.
[00:42:33.045 --> 00:42:36.629]  No, they loved it as you followed them, and I've woken up to a lot of your videos.
[00:42:36.669 --> 00:42:43.175]  They love to take, I'm a Christian, they love to take the words of God and twist them to their occultic, Luciferian ends.
[00:42:43.235 --> 00:42:46.278]  By the way, for those who just tuned in for the first time, that is not our opinion.
[00:42:46.779 --> 00:42:49.041]  George Bush engages in satanic rituals.
[00:42:49.682 --> 00:42:52.485]  Three generations back at Skull and Bones in Bohemian Grove.
[00:42:52.545 --> 00:42:53.165]  I've been there.
[00:42:53.506 --> 00:42:54.066]  I've seen it.
[00:42:54.367 --> 00:43:02.294]  And the people, just like Christ told you, the people telling you that are out there praying in public, like the Pharisees, are the very ones you've got to watch.
[00:43:02.695 --> 00:43:03.435]  Absolutely.
[00:43:03.676 --> 00:43:12.104]  And when you hear that, though, that lets you know that's a call signal to anyone paying attention, the initiates, that this is not a singular engagement.
[00:43:12.509 --> 00:43:20.272]  So I've been calling for the last few weeks, at least once a week, but I try to do it honestly daily, and I would beg anyone out there listening, please do this.
[00:43:20.332 --> 00:43:21.873]  I call Dennis Hastert's office.
[00:43:22.633 --> 00:43:31.697]  I've been involved in Republican politics in my state for a lot of years, and I know some influential people and some staffers on both Democrat and Republican House members' staff.
[00:43:32.357 --> 00:43:34.278]  They are getting hammered for impeachment.
[00:43:34.298 --> 00:43:37.039]  You've got to call and beg Dennis Hastert, and if you notice,
[00:43:38.037 --> 00:43:41.860]  I mean, I got to talk to one of his staffers about two weeks ago, and they said, they don't usually say anything.
[00:43:41.920 --> 00:43:46.384]  You give your opinion, sometimes they'll even flip you over to his, just a recording line.
[00:43:47.024 --> 00:43:48.465]  But please hammer them.
[00:43:48.485 --> 00:43:50.627]  The guy did say, he goes, yeah, we're getting a lot of this.
[00:43:51.087 --> 00:44:06.299]  Okay, when I was begging for impeachment, and my main line was, these people, you know, put down whatever laundry list of illegal things they've done, because there's so many, but say to them, the urgency of Hastert starting these hearings now is that they're going to lead us into World War III with Iran.
[00:44:07.092 --> 00:44:12.995]  And if they don't act now, it won't give the legal precedent for the generals to arrest the president if he tries to lead us into a war.
[00:44:13.015 --> 00:44:15.256]  Well, I agree with what you're saying.
[00:44:15.296 --> 00:44:16.036]  Here's the problem.
[00:44:16.096 --> 00:44:25.981]  Hillary, Schumer, Lieberman, most of the Democratic leadership is actually more rabid pro-war than the average Republican in Congress.
[00:44:26.021 --> 00:44:30.303]  So the New World Order has bought both parties, and I'm all for impeachment.
[00:44:30.323 --> 00:44:33.825]  Just like Ron Paul said, they all need to be impeached, including Bush.
[00:44:34.622 --> 00:44:43.927]  It's just that we have to, number one, I appreciate your call, number one right now, be focused like a laser beam on these reports where Israel and the U.S.
[00:44:43.967 --> 00:44:50.451]  government are saying, oh, Hamas and Hezbollah are about to hit the U.S., Canada and England.
[00:44:50.871 --> 00:44:52.072]  We've got to guard targets.
[00:44:52.112 --> 00:44:52.933]  We've got intel.
[00:44:52.953 --> 00:44:55.514]  They're about to hit big terror attacks.
[00:44:55.594 --> 00:44:57.195]  And Iran's behind it.
[00:44:57.335 --> 00:44:58.236]  Syria's behind it.
[00:44:58.516 --> 00:44:59.556]  We've got to go in there.
[00:45:00.277 --> 00:45:02.238]  Iran and Syria have both said they don't want war.
[00:45:03.438 --> 00:45:08.980]  You hear these provocative statements like Israel will be totally destroyed, we will fight back, we will crush you.
[00:45:09.460 --> 00:45:10.921]  You never get the first part of the statement.
[00:45:11.281 --> 00:45:16.662]  It's always when Cheney or Bolton or somebody says, we're going to destroy you and defeat you.
[00:45:16.702 --> 00:45:18.123]  We're going to cause you great pain.
[00:45:18.423 --> 00:45:19.843]  We're going to wipe you off the map.
[00:45:20.344 --> 00:45:29.106]  And then Ahmadinejad will say, well, we want to work with you and not have war, but if you attack us, you will be the ones that feel great pain.
[00:45:29.126 --> 00:45:30.787]  And Israel will be wiped off the map.
[00:45:32.822 --> 00:45:34.223]  I mean, you can go read the foreign press.
[00:45:34.243 --> 00:45:35.224]  There's the full quote.
[00:45:35.264 --> 00:45:36.706]  You can go read it in the Tehran papers.
[00:45:36.746 --> 00:45:37.486]  Read the full quote.
[00:45:37.706 --> 00:45:38.767]  So it's deceptive.
[00:45:39.548 --> 00:45:41.590]  Now, Iran has been making provocative statements.
[00:45:42.411 --> 00:45:43.311]  And it's certainly corrupt.
[00:45:43.331 --> 00:45:44.232]  The mullahs are a joke.
[00:45:44.292 --> 00:45:45.513]  But, I mean, that's what government is.
[00:45:45.553 --> 00:45:46.874]  Government's always corrupt and bad.
[00:45:47.435 --> 00:45:48.096]  History shows it.
[00:45:48.396 --> 00:45:54.681]  But if you go look at Syria, they have been licking boots of Israel and the U.S.
[00:45:54.701 --> 00:45:56.803]  They have been arresting whoever Israel says.
[00:45:57.304 --> 00:45:59.866]  They have been running around arresting, quote, extremists.
[00:46:00.555 --> 00:46:04.139]  People that want political change in their country, that run the gamut from the good, the bad, and the ugly.
[00:46:04.920 --> 00:46:10.145]  They've had a police state over there, literally in the news, taking orders from Israel, arresting whoever they're told.
[00:46:11.673 --> 00:46:12.113]  We're good to go.
[00:46:42.495 --> 00:46:44.916]  They are a pushover.
[00:46:46.976 --> 00:46:51.357]  And they know that, and they have been licking boots just like Gaddafi for decades.
[00:46:52.218 --> 00:46:52.998]  For decades.
[00:46:53.758 --> 00:47:01.380]  Gaddafi boy in 86 when they killed his daughter, and before then he had been standing up to them and had been overselling oil.
[00:47:01.760 --> 00:47:05.681]  You notice after that attack and killing some of his family, he reduced oil production?
[00:47:05.701 --> 00:47:06.582]  That's what they were mad about.
[00:47:06.622 --> 00:47:08.342]  It wasn't, quote, he was hunting terrorists.
[00:47:08.382 --> 00:47:11.703]  It's been proven that British intelligence carried out the Lockerbie bombing.
[00:47:12.273 --> 00:47:17.798]  And they told him, look, we'll kill more of your family unless you arrest these guys and say they did it, and unless you reduce oil production.
[00:47:18.759 --> 00:47:23.484]  And I knew about that, and I was shocked a few years ago when somebody mailed me a Frontline TV special.
[00:47:24.184 --> 00:47:25.786]  I think it was Frontliner or was it Nova?
[00:47:26.086 --> 00:47:28.689]  It was one of those shows and they were admitting all of this.
[00:47:29.409 --> 00:47:32.853]  Can you imagine Muammar Gaddafi trying to pump his own oil?
[00:47:32.913 --> 00:47:34.234]  Well, he wasn't funding terrorists.
[00:47:35.785 --> 00:47:37.025]  I mean, that's the reality.
[00:47:37.065 --> 00:47:37.845]  But, man, he rolled over.
[00:47:37.885 --> 00:47:38.846]  He said, I will.
[00:47:38.946 --> 00:47:40.066]  Yes, you can come in.
[00:47:40.086 --> 00:47:41.466]  You can control the oil fields.
[00:47:41.486 --> 00:47:42.866]  I'll produce production, please.
[00:47:43.407 --> 00:47:44.327]  Yes, sir.
[00:47:44.647 --> 00:47:47.287]  And now we're told he's our ally, you see.
[00:47:47.848 --> 00:47:53.609]  Well, Syria saw that, and they have been literally licking, they've been sucking boots.
[00:47:54.349 --> 00:48:00.250]  They have been on their backs like a dog that rolls over, wetting themselves, just begging.
[00:48:01.230 --> 00:48:04.231]  Just begging and cowering in fear.
[00:48:05.071 --> 00:48:06.591]  I mean, I read this stuff every day.
[00:48:06.671 --> 00:48:08.272]  I follow their announcements and what they do.
[00:48:08.732 --> 00:48:09.832]  And what's Israel's answer?
[00:48:10.032 --> 00:48:10.933]  We may invade you.
[00:48:10.973 --> 00:48:14.734]  So finally, their government will be thrown out immediately, even though it's a dictatorship.
[00:48:16.434 --> 00:48:19.435]  People will riot if they don't at least say back, well, okay, we'll fight back then.
[00:48:21.235 --> 00:48:22.276]  They said don't fight back.
[00:48:25.837 --> 00:48:29.198]  That's the type of twisting that we witness in all of this.
[00:48:30.998 --> 00:48:33.819]  And again, you've got all these idiot neocon followers, these zombies.
[00:48:34.982 --> 00:48:35.742]  I hear them on the radio.
[00:48:36.202 --> 00:48:38.223]  Syria's vicious and attacking us.
[00:48:38.263 --> 00:48:39.723]  We need to park and lot them.
[00:48:40.083 --> 00:48:42.284]  And I've said to them before in debates and on the street.
[00:48:42.484 --> 00:48:43.284]  Okay, where's Syria?
[00:48:43.884 --> 00:48:45.904]  It's over there, Middle East.
[00:48:46.845 --> 00:48:48.405]  I go, okay, what is its border?
[00:48:48.925 --> 00:48:52.046]  It's over there.
[00:48:53.666 --> 00:48:54.926]  Well, what's its history?
[00:48:55.506 --> 00:48:56.106]  Who's its leader?
[00:48:56.406 --> 00:48:56.667]  Huh?
[00:48:57.347 --> 00:48:58.807]  Yes, they're all the same.
[00:49:00.200 --> 00:49:04.823]  Again, over two-thirds of American college students cannot find Iraq on a map.
[00:49:06.744 --> 00:49:10.227]  Eighty-plus percent of high school graduates don't know who the vice president is.
[00:49:10.807 --> 00:49:12.348]  Most adults don't know anything.
[00:49:12.608 --> 00:49:13.889]  They know nothing.
[00:49:13.949 --> 00:49:17.632]  They are complete... I don't want to say idiots.
[00:49:17.932 --> 00:49:18.732]  They're just ignorant.
[00:49:18.772 --> 00:49:27.518]  They know all about NASCAR and all about acting cool and all about how to put Chinese-American desecrated flags made by slaves all over their car.
[00:49:27.558 --> 00:49:28.619]  They know how to act cool.
[00:49:30.840 --> 00:49:40.420]  They're totally into being macho for no reason, but they'll roll over to a cop, giving them orders, by the way, and they'll hand their kids over to CPS and jab them full of deadly vaccines.
[00:49:41.365 --> 00:49:42.966]  You know, they got a little kid who's a hemophiliac.
[00:49:42.986 --> 00:49:45.107]  They'll probably still give him a factor of 8, even though it'll give him AIDS.
[00:49:45.347 --> 00:49:46.987]  They're the types that are so cowardly.
[00:49:47.007 --> 00:49:50.109]  See, cowards deny that there's corruption.
[00:49:50.149 --> 00:49:52.790]  Cowards deny that bad things are going on.
[00:49:53.090 --> 00:49:55.251]  Cowards deny that we're in trouble.
[00:49:55.571 --> 00:49:59.573]  Cowards deny... I mean, you talk to one of these neocon followers, hey, the dollar's been devalued.
[00:49:59.833 --> 00:50:00.233]  Huh?
[00:50:00.773 --> 00:50:01.193]  What?
[00:50:01.954 --> 00:50:06.916]  Yeah, and it's the Mayrebs' fault if they even know what the dollar devaluation is or what it means.
[00:50:09.568 --> 00:50:15.213]  Oh, they won't call into the show, but about once a month, I'll be out at the lake eating a hamburger.
[00:50:17.074 --> 00:50:18.996]  Maybe once a month, get to go fishing or something.
[00:50:19.977 --> 00:50:26.903]  It's usually these upper middle class people, and maybe 15 people come over to the table to say hi, and they're fans and appreciate me.
[00:50:27.944 --> 00:50:30.726]  They're always driving a big Harley, and I'm not saying you're bad if you have a Harley.
[00:50:30.746 --> 00:50:34.149]  I mean, it's that certain lawyer type, let's say, lobbyist type.
[00:50:34.870 --> 00:50:44.979]  You know, 55 years old, pot belly, $80,000 hog, and they'll just kind of, hey, why don't you leave the country if you don't like it?
[00:50:45.399 --> 00:50:46.340]  And I go, hey, punk!
[00:50:46.360 --> 00:50:48.922]  If my family had won me, hey, punk, come over here and say that to my face.
[00:50:49.783 --> 00:50:50.323]  They'll go, huh?
[00:50:50.583 --> 00:50:55.848]  And as soon as I bull up, not to fight them, just get in their face, they'll kind of, get out of this country!
[00:50:56.208 --> 00:50:57.309]  Off on their motorcycle.
[00:51:04.458 --> 00:51:07.640]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[00:51:08.001 --> 00:51:09.902]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[00:51:10.302 --> 00:51:17.968]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:18.648 --> 00:51:25.693]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:51:26.093 --> 00:51:29.035]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran.
[00:51:29.416 --> 00:51:31.737]  A White House probe to disseminate fake news.
[00:51:32.157 --> 00:51:32.978]  NSA spies.
[00:51:33.467 --> 00:51:37.550]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:51:37.810 --> 00:51:41.333]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:51:41.793 --> 00:51:43.694]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:51:44.054 --> 00:51:47.937]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:54:14.422 --> 00:54:15.382]  Here's a gem.
[00:54:16.002 --> 00:54:19.603]  CIA chief says warrants ill-suited for Al-Qaeda hunts.
[00:54:19.623 --> 00:54:23.064]  See, warrants are just ill-suited in America now, and we don't need them.
[00:54:23.124 --> 00:54:29.245]  And federal judge says, yeah, AT&T can just spy on all your phone calls and give it all to the government.
[00:54:29.305 --> 00:54:31.465]  No warrants, just all of you being spied on.
[00:54:31.565 --> 00:54:32.065]  It's freedom.
[00:54:32.945 --> 00:54:35.446]  Oh, but we don't spy on American citizens, but we spy on all of you.
[00:54:36.846 --> 00:54:43.167]  And, you know, getting back to neocons, it's literally probably happened 20 times or so that I'll be walking down Congress or
[00:54:43.920 --> 00:54:44.561]  We're good to go.
[00:55:05.433 --> 00:55:16.917]  They think it's manly to strut around grunting and belching and loving George Bush and sticking little flags all over their vehicles.
[00:55:17.818 --> 00:55:24.340]  That's what they think America is all about while the Constitution and the country itself is being dismantled publicly.
[00:55:25.900 --> 00:55:28.261]  And believe me, they're brown shirts, folks.
[00:55:28.301 --> 00:55:30.522]  They will love the tyranny.
[00:55:30.542 --> 00:55:37.104]  They will love being part of it because most of them are not working for the government but sucking off of it through corporate welfare.
[00:55:37.684 --> 00:55:39.104]  And so they just love the system.
[00:55:39.124 --> 00:55:40.785]  They see themselves as part of the system.
[00:55:42.185 --> 00:55:46.207]  And they're the type that call in and say, let's turn the Middle East into a parking lot.
[00:55:48.007 --> 00:55:49.848]  I want to go to Jerry and Patrick and others, and we will.
[00:55:49.928 --> 00:55:53.449]  But before we do that, my new film Terror Storm is out.
[00:55:55.273 --> 00:55:56.213]  It's my best work yet.
[00:55:56.333 --> 00:55:57.674]  The history of government-sponsored terror.
[00:55:57.714 --> 00:56:00.275]  We go to London, cover the 7-7 bombings, be an inside job.
[00:56:00.315 --> 00:56:03.856]  The latest information on how the Iraq war was based on staged intelligence.
[00:56:04.617 --> 00:56:07.038]  We get into the White House memo, the Downing Street memo.
[00:56:07.078 --> 00:56:09.639]  We talk to all these government experts, in and out of government.
[00:56:10.099 --> 00:56:15.841]  The last 20-30 minutes we cover 9-11 with the Charlie Sheen info and Professor Jones and Professor...
[00:56:17.423 --> 00:56:20.064]  Well, Dr. Morgan Reynolds, all these other incredible people.
[00:56:20.565 --> 00:56:21.605]  It really is my best work.

[00:56:36.593 --> 00:56:39.275]  A few more speakers we're going to post, and we're done posting it all.
[00:56:39.955 --> 00:56:41.436]  What is it, like 20 hours when we're done?
[00:56:41.476 --> 00:56:43.057]  It's like 15, 16 now that it's there.
[00:56:44.068 --> 00:56:49.471]  And just all the special features, the best audio interviews, prisonplanet.tv.
[00:56:50.172 --> 00:56:53.794]  Right now, let's talk to Jerry calling from Canada.
[00:56:54.074 --> 00:56:54.695]  You're on the air.
[00:56:54.715 --> 00:56:55.275]  Thanks for holding.
[00:56:55.295 --> 00:56:56.456]  How are you doing, Jalex?
[00:56:56.636 --> 00:56:56.756]  Good.
[00:56:56.776 --> 00:56:57.536]  First caller.
[00:56:59.858 --> 00:57:01.078]  I've got one question for you.
[00:57:01.579 --> 00:57:01.899]  Sure.
[00:57:02.019 --> 00:57:05.861]  You guys advertise a bookstore called Northwood, is it?
[00:57:06.001 --> 00:57:08.823]  Bookstore at 281 Wellwood, Pennsylvania?
[00:57:09.623 --> 00:57:10.284]  Northwood.
[00:57:10.324 --> 00:57:11.965]  I don't know of a bookstore called Northwood.
[00:57:12.392 --> 00:57:14.954]  Well, it's advertised on your thing.
[00:57:14.974 --> 00:57:17.315]  Do you know the name of the place?
[00:57:18.916 --> 00:57:20.417]  Northwood Bookstore.
[00:57:20.437 --> 00:57:22.139]  Are you talking about Northern Voice?
[00:57:22.859 --> 00:57:25.381]  Northern Voice?
[00:57:25.761 --> 00:57:29.163]  I believe there's a bookstore advertised on the network called that, yes.
[00:57:29.804 --> 00:57:33.486]  It's N-O-R-T-H-E-R-N-V-O-I-C-E?
[00:57:34.207 --> 00:57:34.487]  Yes, sir.
[00:57:34.507 --> 00:57:35.828]  And you've got your radio on in the background.
[00:57:35.868 --> 00:57:38.469]  Can you do me a big favor and cut that off?
[00:57:38.830 --> 00:57:39.610]  Okay, I got it off.
[00:57:40.911 --> 00:57:42.192]  Okay, so it's Northern Voice.
[00:57:42.679 --> 00:57:45.100]  Box 281, Wildwood, Pennsylvania.
[00:57:46.922 --> 00:57:47.262]  Yes, sir.
[00:57:47.862 --> 00:57:49.423]  Okay, do you have a zip code?
[00:57:49.763 --> 00:57:50.284]  No, I don't.
[00:57:50.544 --> 00:57:50.944]  Okay.
[00:57:52.005 --> 00:57:52.845]  You have a phone number.
[00:57:53.446 --> 00:57:55.247]  You see, and I appreciate your call.
[00:57:55.267 --> 00:57:57.008]  I'm sorry I can't help you here on air.
[00:57:57.728 --> 00:57:58.929]  There's a whole bunch of sponsors.
[00:57:59.569 --> 00:58:06.133]  My sponsors are my videos, Big Berkeys, and Calvin Pure Soap and Gold.
[00:58:06.173 --> 00:58:06.934]  That's my sponsors.
[00:58:06.954 --> 00:58:07.894]  I know the numbers for them.
[00:58:08.615 --> 00:58:09.875]  I know all about those products.
[00:58:09.975 --> 00:58:10.756]  I cannot speak...
[00:58:11.348 --> 00:58:14.850]  For all of the other people and places and things that are advertised here.
[00:58:15.450 --> 00:58:20.492]  And I'm sorry, sir, I don't have a list of the sponsors or their numbers for you here on me.
[00:58:20.592 --> 00:58:20.972]  Thank you.
[00:58:21.593 --> 00:58:27.756]  All right, we've got an amazing guest joining us, Mike Papantonio, for the full hour next hour.
[00:58:27.776 --> 00:58:36.680]  He's one of the most successful litigant lawyers in the United States, and he goes after the bad guys, and we appreciate his work.
[00:58:37.420 --> 00:58:39.221]  He'll be joining us coming up in 60 seconds.
[00:58:41.421 --> 00:58:41.802]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.182 --> 00:59:00.283]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.943 --> 00:59:02.084]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.704 --> 00:59:03.525]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.285 --> 00:59:05.186]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.206 --> 00:59:09.509]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.029 --> 00:59:14.152]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:15.353 --> 00:59:22.297]  We rarely have guests on two weeks in a row, but we only had him on this for 30 minutes last week, and it was just an amazing interview.
[00:59:22.778 --> 00:59:27.781]  He valiantly, successfully litigated against Bayer Pharmaceutical, the Nazi-connected
[00:59:28.550 --> 00:59:29.110]  We're good to go.
[00:59:45.342 --> 00:59:47.423]  That airs Saturdays from 5 p.m.
[00:59:47.483 --> 00:59:47.964]  to 7 p.m.
[00:59:48.004 --> 00:59:49.505]  Eastern Standard Time.
[00:59:50.086 --> 00:59:54.529]  And since I had him on, I've researched him and learned what a great person he is.
[00:59:54.609 --> 00:59:58.333]  He's Mike Papantonio, and he joins us with a full hour today.
[00:59:58.353 --> 01:00:00.795]  And I said, Mike, so much is going on.
[01:00:00.815 --> 01:00:02.336]  I was getting you on about election fraud.
[01:00:02.356 --> 01:00:04.818]  We could talk 10 hours about that, but what about the war?
[01:00:04.858 --> 01:00:08.401]  And he said it's a disaster, so I wanted to get his take on that first.
[01:00:08.481 --> 01:00:11.444]  But it's great to have you on with us, sir.
[01:00:11.664 --> 01:00:12.104]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:00:12.184 --> 01:00:14.306]  You know, to start the discussion, I've got to tell you something.
[01:00:14.326 --> 01:00:20.170]  People ought to read Terrorist Storm, and they can better understand what is actually going on over there.
[01:00:21.150 --> 01:00:25.813]  You know, I know it's hard to promo your own stuff, but I've got to promo it for you.
[01:00:26.134 --> 01:00:27.134]  People need to read this stuff.
[01:00:27.234 --> 01:00:34.599]  I mean, they need to find out that these issues that you're talking about are, you know, not to arm yourself with that information is a mistake.
[01:00:35.019 --> 01:00:40.343]  Look, you nail it every time you take a look at something like Israel and Lebanon.
[01:00:41.169 --> 01:00:42.191]  First of all, let me just tell you this.
[01:00:42.532 --> 01:00:50.770]  To think that we're engaged in the type of escalation that we're involved with right now over two soldiers being kidnapped is absurd.
[01:00:51.565 --> 01:01:01.248]  The truth is, you know, and I know you know this, Alex, but the invasion of Lebanon has been planned between Israel and the Bush administration as far back as June of this year.
[01:01:02.049 --> 01:01:05.810]  You had the American Enterprise Institute meet there in Beaver Creek, Colorado.
[01:01:06.290 --> 01:01:07.451]  And Dick Cheney blessed it.
[01:01:07.631 --> 01:01:09.331]  Dick Cheney said, we want to do this.
[01:01:09.371 --> 01:01:10.772]  We want you to go forward with this.
[01:01:12.772 --> 01:01:13.913]  So this didn't just happen.
[01:01:13.993 --> 01:01:15.453]  This is the October surprise.
[01:01:15.473 --> 01:01:17.994]  They're developing and openly saying Iran-Syria.
[01:01:18.174 --> 01:01:19.035]  You got it, my friend.
[01:01:19.355 --> 01:01:19.835]  You know, look...
[01:01:20.951 --> 01:01:25.753]  When people hear you say that or they hear me say that, you know what the reaction is?
[01:01:26.093 --> 01:01:28.655]  They want to say it can't be true.
[01:01:29.235 --> 01:01:30.335]  And I've got to tell you something.
[01:01:31.676 --> 01:01:45.202]  For me to go on the air and say that this is true and for you to have written and researched and put as much information as you have out there to try to enlighten people, you don't do that by taking risks.
[01:01:45.582 --> 01:01:46.103]  We're good to go.
[01:02:01.221 --> 01:02:04.883]  We need to trash all of the past Middle East peace accords.
[01:02:05.143 --> 01:02:06.604]  We need to trash Oslo.
[01:02:06.904 --> 01:02:13.807]  We need to do away with the way we've done business in the Middle East, which is to try to hold things together.
[01:02:14.168 --> 01:02:24.513]  And what's happening here, the reason George Bush and this administration, really run by Cheney at this point, but the reason that they're unwilling to say, to demand a ceasefire.
[01:02:24.533 --> 01:02:29.215]  Look, you've got kids burning up in buildings, and it's not over two kidnapped soldiers.
[01:02:30.776 --> 01:02:35.377]  They're repeatedly bombing with triangulated, focused attacks, UN bases.
[01:02:35.757 --> 01:02:36.277]  Exactly.
[01:02:36.577 --> 01:02:45.819]  And for a president, don't you understand, we've never had a president that has been unwilling to say it's time for a ceasefire until we can get to the table and talk about this.
[01:02:46.159 --> 01:02:52.661]  And if people don't understand that this is expansionism into Iran and Syria, and you know who's paying for that, Alex?
[01:02:53.201 --> 01:02:54.522]  It's not the Israelis.
[01:02:54.762 --> 01:02:56.722]  The Israelis aren't paying for these bombs.
[01:02:56.942 --> 01:02:58.863]  They're not paying for this military operation.
[01:02:59.163 --> 01:03:02.984]  American taxpayers are doing it, and we're getting drawn into this fight.
[01:03:03.184 --> 01:03:10.827]  We're getting drawn in in such a way that they know that American troops at some point are going to have to be on the ground fighting this war.
[01:03:11.007 --> 01:03:13.008]  Well, Israel's already asking for foreign trips.
[01:03:13.448 --> 01:03:15.129]  I mean, this is so clear.
[01:03:15.209 --> 01:03:18.071]  Bush told his biographer in 1990 he'd be a war president.
[01:03:18.131 --> 01:03:19.812]  His ratings go up every time he does this.
[01:03:20.112 --> 01:03:25.114]  He has to do this to smokescreen all of the other scandals and Enron and the corruption.
[01:03:25.795 --> 01:03:37.701]  And when we get back, let's continue along this line and then get into the domestic front, how they're turning America into a police state, how they're trying to seize control of our electoral process because they know the people are going to throw them out on their ears.
[01:03:38.582 --> 01:03:39.282]  At every level...
[01:03:40.118 --> 01:03:50.895]  My question for Mike when we get back is, is George Bush trying to set up an effective dictatorship in the U.S., and is this widening war really about creating a smoke screen to do that?
[01:03:51.116 --> 01:03:51.797]  We'll be right back.
[01:03:56.554 --> 01:03:59.736]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[01:04:00.077 --> 01:04:02.038]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[01:04:02.398 --> 01:04:10.064]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:04:10.744 --> 01:04:17.789]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:04:18.189 --> 01:04:21.131]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iraq.
[01:04:21.471 --> 01:04:23.833]  The White House programmed to disseminate fake news.
[01:04:24.253 --> 01:04:25.094]  NSA spies.
[01:04:25.569 --> 01:04:26.330]  Or by calling toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[01:04:26.370 --> 01:04:27.911]  Or watch it right now online at prisonplanet.tv.
[01:04:54.901 --> 01:04:55.942]  The war on terrorism.
[01:04:56.263 --> 01:04:59.046]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[01:04:59.326 --> 01:05:03.471]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[01:05:03.911 --> 01:05:04.732]  So what do you do?
[01:05:05.053 --> 01:05:09.618]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[01:05:10.100 --> 01:05:12.222]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[01:05:12.723 --> 01:05:27.417]  Sheltering in Place, surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[01:05:27.477 --> 01:05:34.524]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[01:05:34.944 --> 01:05:36.845]  Or order on the web at BerkeyWater.com.
[01:05:54.150 --> 01:05:54.970]  Come on, Bill.
[01:05:55.191 --> 01:06:00.372]  Two weeks ago you were riding the bicycle, and today you're showing up in your new car and telling me you're buying a house.
[01:06:00.712 --> 01:06:02.193]  What did you do, rob Bill Gates?
[01:06:02.293 --> 01:06:04.273]  No, John, I didn't rob Bill Gates.
[01:06:04.553 --> 01:06:10.075]  What I did do is visit the website www.didyourobbillgates.com.
[01:06:10.355 --> 01:06:16.617]  That's where I learned how to make $3,000 to $9,000 each and every week, starting with my very first week.
[01:06:16.937 --> 01:06:19.118]  It's a simple program that does all the work for you.
[01:06:19.418 --> 01:06:22.862]  I'm already up to $25,000 just going on my third week.
[01:06:22.882 --> 01:06:23.583]  Whoa.
[01:06:23.904 --> 01:06:25.105]  What was that website again?
[01:06:25.185 --> 01:06:28.670]  It's www.didyourobbillgates.com.
[01:06:28.970 --> 01:06:30.091]  Now write this down, John.
[01:06:30.231 --> 01:06:34.537]  You should go there and learn how this program can help you become financially independent, too.
[01:06:34.677 --> 01:06:35.258]  Thanks, Bill.
[01:06:35.538 --> 01:06:36.739]  I'm going there right now.
[01:06:37.140 --> 01:06:37.781]  Check, please.
[01:06:39.562 --> 01:06:41.004]  Uh, you got this one, right, Bill?
[01:06:41.505 --> 01:06:42.087]  Sure, John.
[01:06:42.327 --> 01:06:46.715]  Don't forget, it's www.didyourobbillgates.com.
[01:06:46.996 --> 01:06:48.679]  Next time, you'll be buying me lunch.
[01:06:48.859 --> 01:06:49.140]  Deal.
[01:06:57.915 --> 01:06:58.556]  Big Brother.
[01:06:59.217 --> 01:07:00.258]  Mainstream media.
[01:07:00.998 --> 01:07:02.119]  Government cover-ups.
[01:07:02.760 --> 01:07:03.581]  You want answers?
[01:07:04.321 --> 01:07:05.202]  Well, so does he.
[01:07:05.222 --> 01:07:09.866]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:10.086 --> 01:07:14.190]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:07:16.072 --> 01:07:18.194]  We had him on with us last week for a half hour.
[01:07:18.214 --> 01:07:19.255]  He lives with a full hour today.
[01:07:19.295 --> 01:07:21.196]  We'll take calls in the second half hour.
[01:07:21.216 --> 01:07:22.698]  He's Michael Papantonio.
[01:07:23.866 --> 01:07:26.027]  And Mike Papantonio is an amazing individual.
[01:07:26.747 --> 01:07:39.191]  I first saw him on national television years ago, and then I saw him up there exposing Bayer, openly murdering tens of thousands of people, putting AIDS virus and hepatitis C in the blood supply, knowingly, just pure wickedness.
[01:07:39.813 --> 01:07:40.213]  We're good to go.
[01:08:03.231 --> 01:08:03.872]  But that's okay.
[01:08:30.694 --> 01:08:33.056]  If this were a dictatorship, it'd be a heck of a lot easier.
[01:08:34.577 --> 01:08:35.898]  Just so long as I'm the dictator.
[01:08:37.639 --> 01:08:39.981]  And the neocons have said they want another war.
[01:08:40.021 --> 01:08:41.623]  They want to attack Iran and Syria.
[01:08:41.683 --> 01:08:43.864]  Sixty-plus countries on the neocon hit list.
[01:08:44.305 --> 01:08:46.486]  They need a war coming up into this election.
[01:08:46.586 --> 01:08:48.468]  This is their October surprise.
[01:08:48.768 --> 01:08:51.610]  They're openly talking about going into Syria, into Iran.
[01:08:52.091 --> 01:08:57.155]  They've been twisting the words of the Iranian president, who I'm no fan of, by the way, but really hyping that.
[01:08:57.795 --> 01:08:59.216]  I went and looked it up.
[01:08:59.256 --> 01:09:02.358]  There are routine captures of Israeli soldiers.
[01:09:02.959 --> 01:09:04.900]  There are routine captures on the other side.
[01:09:05.160 --> 01:09:06.661]  They hyped this out of control.
[01:09:07.242 --> 01:09:10.724]  Now they're blowing up ambulances, UN bases.
[01:09:11.285 --> 01:09:12.425]  They're killing children.
[01:09:12.726 --> 01:09:14.407]  The numbers are much higher than we've been told.
[01:09:14.747 --> 01:09:15.888]  Israelis are dying.
[01:09:16.168 --> 01:09:20.931]  They're escalating all of this so George Bush can be our wartime president.
[01:09:21.311 --> 01:09:24.934]  And now we're not hearing about Iraq, which they promised we'd be out of in six months.
[01:09:25.294 --> 01:09:29.738]  Because it's been put on the back burner publicly, but it's falling apart worse than ever.
[01:09:30.539 --> 01:09:36.665]  Mike Papantonio, give us your expertise, your analysis of where you see this is going, and answer that question.
[01:09:37.546 --> 01:09:42.390]  With the evidence, can we prove that George Bush is really trying to make himself a dictator?
[01:09:42.830 --> 01:09:49.116]  Well, I mean, if you follow this story, I know you followed this story before mainstream media, as you usually do.
[01:09:49.176 --> 01:09:50.718]  You catch these stories way ahead of time.
[01:09:51.440 --> 01:10:06.614]  You know, the 10,000-foot explanation, I think, of what you were talking about with the signing statement, is that any time Congress sends a new legislative bill to be signed by the President, the President has reserved a right to revise the bill or interpret the meaning of the bill in a way that suits his prejudice, whatever it might be.
[01:10:06.975 --> 01:10:13.501]  And in fact, he can disregard the intent of the bill on issues like national security or constitutional grounds.
[01:10:13.561 --> 01:10:15.562]  It's de facto legislating right there.
[01:10:15.762 --> 01:10:17.504]  Yeah, you do away with two arms of the government.
[01:10:17.524 --> 01:10:18.564]  You do away with the judiciary.
[01:10:18.584 --> 01:10:19.465]  You do away with Congress.
[01:10:19.505 --> 01:10:20.726]  Here's the kicker.
[01:10:20.806 --> 01:10:22.847]  Here's what most people don't understand.
[01:10:23.528 --> 01:10:32.494]  This is a president that in five and a half years has done this 800 times, where he has changed the intent of a bill.
[01:10:32.554 --> 01:10:37.777]  Now, to put that in perspective, Alex, if you take 212 years of presidents, if you take 43, 212 years of American democracy...
[01:10:42.680 --> 01:10:43.601]  43 separate presidents.
[01:10:43.881 --> 01:10:48.383]  If you take all of that together, it's only been done 600 times in 212 years.
[01:10:48.703 --> 01:10:53.265]  This guy has done it 800 times in five and a half years.
[01:10:53.485 --> 01:10:54.685]  What is it that he's signing?
[01:10:55.065 --> 01:10:57.126]  That ties into what we started off talking about.
[01:10:57.466 --> 01:11:06.510]  When you see him do one of these presidential signing statements, it always involves things that he typically is trying to avoid personal accountability.
[01:11:06.510 --> 01:11:10.454]  Well, in the past, a signing statement was just the President's opinion of the bill.
[01:11:10.474 --> 01:11:15.199]  It had no legislative or judicial or even executive authority.
[01:11:15.239 --> 01:11:15.620]  Look at this.
[01:11:16.060 --> 01:11:17.361]  This is what Lou Dobbs said today.
[01:11:17.862 --> 01:11:20.204]  Dobbs, why is the President ignoring our laws?
[01:11:20.264 --> 01:11:20.505]  Bush...
[01:11:22.286 --> 01:11:23.227]  And then it just goes on.
[01:11:23.908 --> 01:11:34.257]  With upraised right and left hand upon the Bible, each of our presidents from George W. Bush to George Washington has solemnly sworn to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States.
[01:11:34.578 --> 01:11:44.306]  The American Bar Association claims President Bush has violated the oath by issuing hundreds of signing statements to disregard selected provisions of the laws that Congress passed and he signed.
[01:11:44.567 --> 01:11:48.050]  Well, four months ago, Bush signed a law that Congress hadn't even passed.
[01:11:50.390 --> 01:11:51.451]  That's exactly right.
[01:11:51.771 --> 01:12:02.702]  Yeah, but if you look at what he signs, Alex, it always involves things like, it always somehow ties back to his personal accountability, protecting himself from personal accountability.
[01:12:02.722 --> 01:12:04.964]  It's things like the torture issue.
[01:12:05.004 --> 01:12:06.746]  It's eavesdropping on American citizens.
[01:12:07.146 --> 01:12:07.786]  Think about this, Alex.
[01:12:29.998 --> 01:12:40.702]  When he signs that, when he comes up with a presidential signing statement, what he's saying to the federal government that's supposed to enforce these various bills, he's saying, you don't really have to do that.
[01:12:41.202 --> 01:12:46.444]  All you have to do is read what I have to say about it, and then you have to follow what I have to say about it.
[01:12:47.565 --> 01:12:48.985]  George Orwell wrote a great book.
[01:12:49.025 --> 01:12:49.725]  I know you've read it.
[01:12:49.986 --> 01:12:51.026]  It's called The Animal Farm.
[01:12:51.426 --> 01:12:57.370]  Animal Farm talks about the way that in small increments we lose our freedoms.
[01:12:57.570 --> 01:12:58.791]  Very small increments.
[01:12:59.031 --> 01:13:00.532]  We almost don't understand it.
[01:13:00.953 --> 01:13:03.414]  And in that book he talks about this very type of thing.
[01:13:03.674 --> 01:13:07.017]  This is a way that a person gains control of power.
[01:13:07.377 --> 01:13:09.238]  And all you have to do is look at the empirical.
[01:13:09.438 --> 01:13:11.720]  This isn't something we're just making up.
[01:13:12.100 --> 01:13:21.629]  People can go to the Washington Post, they can go to the New York Times, they can go to any major news outlet and see that this guy has signed 800 of these in five and a half years.
[01:13:21.649 --> 01:13:22.730]  Well, here's another example.
[01:13:22.790 --> 01:13:28.676]  He signed papers bringing us into the American Union last year with Fox and Martin of Canada.
[01:13:29.376 --> 01:13:34.440]  And then when major media calls him and asks for the documents, they say you have no right to them.
[01:13:34.760 --> 01:13:39.924]  Meanwhile, Texas businesses have now been issued new codes saying we're in an American union.
[01:13:39.984 --> 01:13:45.869]  So, I mean, he's doing things that we've never seen the likes of in any free society.
[01:13:45.909 --> 01:13:48.991]  And then the domestic police state that they're setting up.
[01:13:49.051 --> 01:13:54.595]  And Tommy Franks, who we then learned was secretly on the PR payroll of Bush when he was buying $1.6 billion.
[01:13:54.615 --> 01:13:54.835]  Yes, yes.
[01:13:56.136 --> 01:14:01.681]  In fake news, that's a lot of fake news, saying one more attack, we go into martial law.
[01:14:02.141 --> 01:14:11.890]  Are you concerned if there's another attack staged, or some other attack carried out in this country, that George Bush may drop the hammer and bring us into full-bore police state?
[01:14:12.090 --> 01:14:12.811]  I can tell you this.
[01:14:13.051 --> 01:14:16.634]  I think if you look at what's happening, and all of this ties together.
[01:14:16.654 --> 01:14:18.216]  It ties together anybody paying attention.
[01:14:18.236 --> 01:14:20.858]  If you look at what we just talked about, the signing statements,
[01:14:21.258 --> 01:14:37.304]  When we try to find out, at the end of the day, when we try to find out what really happened, how closely did Dick Cheney make the decisions to involve this country, to directly involve this country, ultimately it's going to be American lives over there, American soldiers.
[01:14:37.884 --> 01:14:39.825]  We're already spending the money to pay for this war.
[01:14:39.845 --> 01:14:40.925]  It's going to be taxpayers' money.
[01:14:41.185 --> 01:14:42.846]  But when we try to find out...
[01:14:43.466 --> 01:14:44.347]  What really happened?
[01:14:44.387 --> 01:14:49.111]  He's going to use the signing statement as some protective mechanism to where we can't get to that.
[01:14:49.131 --> 01:14:49.892]  But we know this.
[01:14:50.412 --> 01:14:51.033]  We know this.
[01:14:51.593 --> 01:14:53.595]  We know that this is the first step.
[01:14:54.135 --> 01:14:56.617]  We know it because they've talked about it for a decade.
[01:14:56.977 --> 01:15:07.166]  This is the first step to bring into place this clean break policy where we totally trash all of the Middle East peace accords
[01:15:07.586 --> 01:15:09.107]  Including the Oslo Agreement.
[01:15:09.367 --> 01:15:15.410]  We trash all of that so we can come to the... Outwardly, we're saying we're trying to come to the aid of Israel.
[01:15:15.430 --> 01:15:16.951]  It doesn't have anything to do with Israel.
[01:15:17.591 --> 01:15:19.052]  All Israel is is a front guy.
[01:15:19.092 --> 01:15:21.514]  We're using Israel as the thug here.
[01:15:21.914 --> 01:15:23.975]  Israel is the thug that's having to do the dirty work.
[01:15:24.315 --> 01:15:27.157]  That Americans will not allow this president to do.
[01:15:27.417 --> 01:15:30.859]  We've lost 2,600 American soldiers in this war.
[01:15:31.079 --> 01:15:33.560]  We spent $400 billion in Iraq.
[01:15:33.801 --> 01:15:40.624]  Do you think that he's going to be able to go to the American public and say, now it's time to go into Syria, now it's time to go into Iran?
[01:15:40.805 --> 01:15:42.445]  You know what the problem here is, Alex?
[01:15:42.806 --> 01:15:45.227]  This ain't just about southern Lebanon.
[01:15:45.467 --> 01:15:48.409]  Because Russia and China have a direct...
[01:15:48.809 --> 01:15:52.631]  They're joined at the hip with Syria and Iran.
[01:15:52.731 --> 01:16:05.958]  Let's talk about that more in just a moment, but getting back to Lebanon for just a second before we talk about the treaties that these other countries have with these defense treaties they have with China and Russia, both Iran and, of course, Syria.
[01:16:06.989 --> 01:16:10.431]  Bush gives Iran an ultimatum a month ago.
[01:16:10.451 --> 01:16:14.153]  He tells them by late July, if you don't do what I say, we're going to start moving against you.
[01:16:14.433 --> 01:16:19.455]  And then right on cue, Israel takes regular occurrences, hypes it up, starts invading.
[01:16:19.495 --> 01:16:23.237]  Now they're talking about going all the way into Syria, members of the Knesset.
[01:16:23.477 --> 01:16:24.718]  They're hyping this thing.
[01:16:25.499 --> 01:16:29.801]  So now, please walk us into what you think will happen if...
[01:16:31.862 --> 01:16:32.944]  How do you see this unfolding?
[01:16:32.984 --> 01:16:34.365]  How will they get into Iran?
[01:16:34.405 --> 01:16:35.426]  How will they get into Syria?
[01:16:35.606 --> 01:16:37.488]  And what do you think China and Russia will do?
[01:16:37.668 --> 01:16:38.589]  Here's where I see it going.
[01:16:38.769 --> 01:16:41.672]  Defeating Hezbollah is a major blow to Iran.
[01:16:41.692 --> 01:16:42.233]  You understand that?
[01:16:42.273 --> 01:16:46.177]  Because Hezbollah and Iran may as well be talking about the same thing.
[01:16:46.657 --> 01:16:53.881]  If Bush can interfere and take out Hezbollah, it's going to be easier for Bush then to sell a war against Iran.
[01:16:54.181 --> 01:16:56.323]  He can't sell it to the American people right now.
[01:16:56.683 --> 01:16:58.344]  If Hezbollah begins attacking U.S.
[01:16:58.404 --> 01:17:04.667]  soldiers on the ground in southern Lebanon, he can sell the war on grounds that they've attacked us first.
[01:17:05.107 --> 01:17:07.109]  Either way, he can't lose.
[01:17:07.309 --> 01:17:11.291]  And by securing that area, he can claim that that flank has been secured.
[01:17:11.631 --> 01:17:12.191]  Exactly.
[01:17:12.291 --> 01:17:18.154]  And he's going to be able to say, he's going to be able to declare victory, and now we're going to be more comfortable with the victory.
[01:17:18.414 --> 01:17:23.237]  So he's actually going to talk people into going after Syria and going after Iran.
[01:17:23.257 --> 01:17:23.817]  But you know what?
[01:17:24.177 --> 01:17:25.918]  He's not going to be the front voice up there.
[01:17:26.198 --> 01:17:33.322]  Dick Cheney saw to that all the way back in June when he met with the American Enterprise Institute out in Beaver Creek, Colorado.
[01:17:33.342 --> 01:17:34.762]  This isn't stuff we're making up.
[01:17:34.822 --> 01:17:36.323]  Go on the Internet if you don't believe us.
[01:17:36.363 --> 01:17:39.524]  Now, they've openly said they're going to stage this and do all of this.
[01:17:40.145 --> 01:17:41.385]  Talk about body language.
[01:17:41.745 --> 01:17:49.428]  Everybody at these meetings there in Beirut and other areas with Condoleezza Rice have solemn, long, ashen faces.
[01:17:49.789 --> 01:17:54.511]  And Rice looks like she's Ronald McDonald with these ear-to-ear smirks.
[01:17:54.591 --> 01:17:55.191]  It's terrifying.
[01:17:56.047 --> 01:17:58.269]  She looks like she's on vacation, doesn't she?
[01:17:58.530 --> 01:18:00.832]  I mean, if you really look at her... She looks like she just won the lottery.
[01:18:00.992 --> 01:18:03.335]  Yeah, like she's down... You know, she loves shoes.
[01:18:03.395 --> 01:18:06.038]  I don't know if you know that, Alex, but she loves to shop at Gucci.
[01:18:06.398 --> 01:18:07.839]  Maybe she's over there shopping.
[01:18:07.899 --> 01:18:10.522]  I don't know, but if I was... Doesn't she spend like 20 grand at a pop or something?
[01:18:10.562 --> 01:18:11.143]  Yeah.
[01:18:11.583 --> 01:18:14.006]  If I'm looking at her right now, I've got to tell you this.
[01:18:14.745 --> 01:18:19.306]  I don't have a sense of confidence that she's doing what we should do to protect our children.
[01:18:19.666 --> 01:18:21.507]  This is not just about us.
[01:18:21.947 --> 01:18:28.549]  If somebody's looking at the escalation of what's taking place in Lebanon, they're not thinking about their children.
[01:18:28.569 --> 01:18:32.390]  Well, I mean, why is William Crystal on TV smiling like he just won the lottery?
[01:18:32.490 --> 01:18:33.870]  Because they have won.
[01:18:33.910 --> 01:18:37.612]  This is something they've planned for years, and now it's all coming to a head.
[01:18:37.632 --> 01:18:38.852]  You know, it's funny.
[01:18:39.132 --> 01:18:40.552]  They kept smiling around for 9-11, too, Mike.
[01:18:40.572 --> 01:18:40.832]  Remember?
[01:18:43.193 --> 01:18:44.494]  Why are they smiling?
[01:18:44.774 --> 01:18:46.295]  Are we the only people who see them smiling?
[01:18:46.576 --> 01:18:47.356]  I don't think so.
[01:18:47.796 --> 01:18:49.598]  We'll be right back with our guest.
[01:18:49.618 --> 01:18:50.138]  Stay with us.
[01:18:55.422 --> 01:18:57.723]  Do you know the truth about breast cancer?
[01:18:58.764 --> 01:19:01.526]  Do you realize that the race for the cure is over?
[01:19:03.115 --> 01:19:12.760]  The best kept secret in the world today is that now it is possible to kill cancer without personal suffering, mutilation, and poisoning of your entire system.
[01:19:13.701 --> 01:19:17.483]  Now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaysMed, Inc.'
[01:19:17.463 --> 01:19:18.844]  's patented methodology.
[01:19:19.651 --> 01:19:30.477]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation, we can destroy skin cancer and breast tumors of any size without adverse side effects at a physician's office.
[01:19:31.097 --> 01:19:33.598]  Star War technology at its best.
[01:19:34.499 --> 01:19:38.741]  For more information, call 702-953-0267 or visit www.lazemedinc.com or call 702-953-0267.
[01:19:55.277 --> 01:19:56.317]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:19:56.718 --> 01:20:02.220]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[01:20:02.780 --> 01:20:03.280]  That's right.
[01:20:03.580 --> 01:20:05.881]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[01:20:06.441 --> 01:20:13.364]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[01:20:13.917 --> 01:20:21.620]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds, and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[01:20:22.060 --> 01:20:26.842]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[01:20:27.523 --> 01:20:32.245]  If you'd like to take a look at gold-free retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[01:20:33.346 --> 01:20:37.488]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[01:20:37.848 --> 01:20:38.088]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:20:38.108 --> 01:20:40.049]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[01:20:40.069 --> 01:20:40.429]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:20:40.729 --> 01:20:41.009]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:20:54.625 --> 01:20:59.129]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[01:20:59.469 --> 01:21:03.553]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[01:21:03.853 --> 01:21:04.394]  We listened.
[01:21:04.714 --> 01:21:09.698]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[01:21:09.959 --> 01:21:10.459]  We listened.
[01:21:10.839 --> 01:21:13.882]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[01:21:14.302 --> 01:21:14.823]  We listened.
[01:21:15.283 --> 01:21:19.345]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[01:21:19.725 --> 01:21:20.225]  We listened.
[01:21:20.565 --> 01:21:25.788]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[01:21:26.208 --> 01:21:27.589]  Again, we listened.
[01:21:27.929 --> 01:21:35.312]  Introducing the Berkey Light, the gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.
[01:21:35.712 --> 01:21:38.753]  Get the Berkey Light, the American water filter for only $259.
[01:21:53.187 --> 01:21:55.369]  By now, it is no surprise that the U.S.
[01:21:55.449 --> 01:22:01.012]  ranks 37th in the world in occurrence of chronic illness, according to the World Health Organization.
[01:22:01.232 --> 01:22:05.975]  Due to modern farming and food processing practices, our food supply has become neutral.
[01:22:10.293 --> 01:22:10.913]  We're good to go.
[01:22:40.273 --> 01:22:45.799]  What if we got a chance back in 1939 to keep Hitler from invading Danzig and Austria and Czechoslovakia and then Poland?
[01:23:03.783 --> 01:23:11.148]  Of course, he staged terror attacks on his own military installations at Gleiwitz to start that war, and that's how he sold the Germans.
[01:23:11.888 --> 01:23:17.852]  And I hate to compare Israel to the Nazis, but this is bringing us into a similar mass world conflict.
[01:23:18.473 --> 01:23:18.853]  We're good to go.
[01:23:18.873 --> 01:23:19.014]  I think?
[01:23:43.195 --> 01:23:50.399]  I mean, I'm not even happy with the Democrats either, but we need to get Bush out of there because he's gone further and done worse things than anybody I've ever studied.
[01:23:50.640 --> 01:23:52.501]  And I'm quite a history of U.S.
[01:23:52.521 --> 01:23:54.122]  history going back to colonial times.
[01:23:54.462 --> 01:23:58.745]  I mean, I feel like I'm sitting here watching a train wreck that is about to happen.
[01:23:58.785 --> 01:24:00.305]  We've already seen a bunch of other train wrecks.
[01:24:00.546 --> 01:24:01.926]  This one's a thousand times bigger.
[01:24:01.946 --> 01:24:04.328]  Do you have that same feeling of just horror?
[01:24:04.568 --> 01:24:05.328]  How do we stop this?
[01:24:05.369 --> 01:24:06.129]  How do we stop this?
[01:24:06.349 --> 01:24:11.032]  Well, unfortunately, what we're seeing is kind of the end of the train right now.
[01:24:11.152 --> 01:24:16.354]  In 1996, you had the Project for a New American Century that put together this whole plan.
[01:24:16.775 --> 01:24:18.776]  The plan, there's three parts to it.
[01:24:18.856 --> 01:24:26.360]  First of all, expand Israel's power, take out Iraq, and really subdue the rest of the Middle East in one way or another.
[01:24:26.660 --> 01:24:30.662]  And that involved Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, I mean...
[01:24:30.982 --> 01:24:32.884]  Go right down the list.
[01:24:33.244 --> 01:24:34.445]  So the point is this.
[01:24:34.806 --> 01:24:41.773]  We're seeing all of this that was dreamed up when they had this meeting that took place for the project for New American Century.
[01:24:41.793 --> 01:24:49.540]  You had Paul Wolfowitz there, Dick Cheney there, Don Rumsfeld, Jeb Bush right here from Florida, Dan Quayle, Steve Forbes, William Bennett.
[01:24:49.760 --> 01:24:52.123]  You had all of these neocon freaks.
[01:24:52.623 --> 01:24:53.664]  And I've got to tell you something.
[01:24:53.684 --> 01:24:58.770]  You know, I'm not so sold the Democrats can handle this problem anyway.
[01:24:58.810 --> 01:25:00.993]  The Democrats have lost their sense of fight.
[01:25:01.293 --> 01:25:04.817]  It's going to take more than Democrat infrastructure to change any of this.
[01:25:05.057 --> 01:25:07.220]  So don't count on the Democrats to be able to change this.
[01:25:07.340 --> 01:25:08.561]  Well, look at Hillary.
[01:25:08.601 --> 01:25:09.262]  She's a hawk.
[01:25:09.702 --> 01:25:10.542]  Well, exactly.
[01:25:10.642 --> 01:25:29.426]  I mean, you know, if you take a look at the... My only point is we've got to get a separation of powers again, and even Ron Paul on my show said that that would be, he's a Republican, it would be good for the country, for Bush to lose control of the Congress, because right now he's got a blank check.
[01:25:29.446 --> 01:25:36.488]  But you're saying, or am I getting from this, you're saying, Mike, that the Democrats are so bought off that even if they win, they may still just go along.
[01:25:36.588 --> 01:25:37.468]  Let me give you a little history.
[01:25:38.028 --> 01:25:42.612]  And when we had Bill Clinton as president, for two years he had a Democratic Congress.
[01:25:42.712 --> 01:25:43.173]  Remember that?
[01:25:43.923 --> 01:26:09.053]  During that time, had he done what he should have done, and he should have gone after these war hawks that I just read, Don Rumsfeld, Paul Wolfowitz, Steve Forbes, Jeb Bush, had he gone after these war hawks then, over the Iran-Contra issue, there was plenty of information that would have put all of these guys in jail, had he done what he should have done, we wouldn't be going through what we're going through right now.
[01:26:09.334 --> 01:26:12.735]  The Democrats have lost their stomach for a fight.
[01:26:13.075 --> 01:26:16.038]  You can't show up at a gunfight with a knife.
[01:26:16.418 --> 01:26:22.344]  They have to understand that if we do get Congress back, it has to be immediate.
[01:26:22.584 --> 01:26:24.806]  There has to be impeachment process starting.
[01:26:25.046 --> 01:26:26.888]  There have to be investigations that start.
[01:26:27.168 --> 01:26:29.430]  And that's the only way we're going to turn it around, Alex.
[01:26:29.450 --> 01:26:35.055]  Let me bring up this facet to you, and then we'll talk about more solutions after the break, and then get a little bit into election fraud and some calls.
[01:26:35.095 --> 01:26:35.736]  This is what I see.
[01:26:36.928 --> 01:26:39.390]  They plan to balkanize Iraq, break it in three or four parts.
[01:26:39.410 --> 01:26:40.390]  That's their own official plan.
[01:26:40.671 --> 01:26:44.273]  Balkanize the rest of the region kind of with pinpoint strikes on infrastructure.
[01:26:44.293 --> 01:26:46.034]  That's the Israeli Plan 83 as well.
[01:26:46.494 --> 01:26:47.295]  But here's the problem.
[01:26:47.555 --> 01:26:49.056]  We're about to get kicked out of Iraq.
[01:26:49.336 --> 01:26:50.056]  It's imploding.
[01:26:50.096 --> 01:26:51.417]  They're already in armored citadels.
[01:26:51.437 --> 01:26:53.138]  They're already in a siege mentality.
[01:26:53.378 --> 01:26:57.000]  It's going even worse than the neocons planned for it to with controlled chaos.
[01:26:58.021 --> 01:26:58.441]  We're good to go.
[01:27:22.486 --> 01:27:23.166]  We're good to go.
[01:27:23.186 --> 01:27:23.366]  I think?
[01:27:43.132 --> 01:27:44.453]  I think $140 billion.
[01:27:45.493 --> 01:27:49.795]  We spend about $3 billion in direct assistance to Israel every single year, year in, year out.
[01:27:50.015 --> 01:27:50.615]  And you know what?
[01:27:50.955 --> 01:27:53.676]  If they will stand guard for us over there, that's great.
[01:27:53.976 --> 01:27:54.757]  We need them.
[01:27:55.057 --> 01:27:59.699]  But we can't have them escalate the way that these neocons want them to escalate.
[01:27:59.939 --> 01:28:02.180]  It's causing harm to Israel.
[01:28:02.500 --> 01:28:03.120]  And you know what?
[01:28:04.200 --> 01:28:08.122]  At the level of the average person in Israel right now, they're starting to understand that.
[01:28:09.853 --> 01:28:10.393]  We're good to go.
[01:28:10.433 --> 01:28:11.314]  We're good to go.
[01:28:44.060 --> 01:28:44.961]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.442 --> 01:28:47.044]  The empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.965 --> 01:28:50.650]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[01:29:47.051 --> 01:29:47.431]  That's

[01:29:53.726 --> 01:29:59.949]  The illuminated Berkey base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[01:30:00.089 --> 01:30:06.253]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[01:30:06.533 --> 01:30:14.977]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[01:30:15.217 --> 01:30:22.241]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter, and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[01:30:22.541 --> 01:30:23.202]  We're good to go.
[01:30:55.546 --> 01:30:59.708]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass?
[01:30:59.948 --> 01:31:01.709]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[01:31:01.989 --> 01:31:08.332]  If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough, the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[01:31:08.612 --> 01:31:14.795]  Using this similar principle, Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[01:31:15.035 --> 01:31:22.539]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions with no side effects.
[01:31:22.619 --> 01:31:22.679]  1-866-885-6625
[01:32:02.641 --> 01:32:13.290]  Welcome back, my friends.
[01:32:13.610 --> 01:32:16.833]  Mike Papantonio is our guest as a syndicated program on...
[01:32:18.274 --> 01:32:22.417]  Air America Ring of Fire with Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
[01:32:22.477 --> 01:32:22.777]  Wow.
[01:32:23.378 --> 01:32:26.340]  And he was honoring me during a break saying he might have me on as a guest sometime.
[01:32:26.440 --> 01:32:28.121]  I would love to do that.
[01:32:28.701 --> 01:32:31.083]  Your calls are coming up here in a few minutes, in about ten minutes.
[01:32:31.103 --> 01:32:35.306]  The toll-free number to join us is 1-800-259-9231.
[01:32:35.746 --> 01:32:42.291]  Because of the limits of time, please talk about election fraud, whether you think there's evidence of it or to the contrary.
[01:32:42.471 --> 01:32:44.473]  Obviously, there's so much evidence it's ridiculous.
[01:32:44.953 --> 01:32:47.715]  Or on the subject of what's happening in the Middle East and the neocons and...
[01:32:48.743 --> 01:32:49.243]  We're good to go.
[01:32:49.343 --> 01:32:49.523]  I think?
[01:33:13.014 --> 01:33:14.775]  And this is like the decline of the Roman Empire.
[01:33:14.895 --> 01:33:22.599]  Our government, the people controlling it, the corporate interests, the kleptomaniacs that run our society, are on total power trips.
[01:33:22.760 --> 01:33:24.340]  They're total warmongers.
[01:33:24.741 --> 01:33:27.022]  None of them have served in the military or been in combat.
[01:33:27.582 --> 01:33:36.187]  And I remember a New York Times article talking about Richard Perle, when he was still in the Defense Department, walking up at a big Georgetown party and bragging to...
[01:33:36.827 --> 01:33:42.812]  Young, good-looking women that he's going to kill a bunch of North Koreans, and do they know how powerful he is?
[01:33:42.852 --> 01:33:43.953]  And there were quotes in there.
[01:33:43.993 --> 01:33:49.177]  I mean, this is sophomoric mental illness in policymakers.
[01:33:49.757 --> 01:33:52.779]  And so, Mike, I mean, I am scared of these people.
[01:33:52.859 --> 01:33:55.802]  And they're giggling, they're snickering, they're smiling.
[01:33:56.302 --> 01:33:57.783]  They can't contain themselves.
[01:33:57.823 --> 01:33:58.343]  You know why?
[01:33:58.383 --> 01:34:02.166]  Because they've never had to pick up an M16 and fight for their lives.
[01:34:02.386 --> 01:34:03.247]  They've never had an AK-47...
[01:34:04.668 --> 01:34:05.109]  We're good to go.
[01:34:25.589 --> 01:34:30.630]  Carl Rove, the architect behind all this, nobody knows where Carl Rove was.
[01:34:31.030 --> 01:34:35.051]  Go down the list of everybody who thinks war is a great and grand thing.
[01:34:35.351 --> 01:34:42.932]  It's great and grand until it's their child that has to be sent over there to a war based on absolute, utter lies.
[01:34:43.352 --> 01:34:51.634]  It's fine with them to escalate in the Middle East until it's their children who have to be vaporized with a bomb.
[01:34:52.575 --> 01:34:55.337]  But you won't see them picking up a gun, Alex.
[01:34:55.357 --> 01:34:59.240]  You won't see them having any kind of history of actually serving this country.
[01:34:59.541 --> 01:35:01.742]  It's always good for somebody else's children.
[01:35:01.762 --> 01:35:02.923]  It's always good for somebody else.
[01:35:03.284 --> 01:35:06.086]  This thing in the Middle East is going to continue to escalate.
[01:35:06.286 --> 01:35:13.452]  And I've got to tell you, soccer moms out there that thought that George Bush was a safe bet for them in 2004, they're reeling right now.
[01:35:13.472 --> 01:35:17.636]  Well, that brings me to my next point that I mentioned earlier, but I want to elaborate on it mathematically.
[01:35:18.459 --> 01:35:19.841]  We're good to go.
[01:35:35.277 --> 01:35:42.321]  Like Secretary White, who was an inside buddy of these guys, he told them, look, 500,000 troops, and they said, you need to resign.
[01:35:42.361 --> 01:35:44.822]  I mean, they're not even listening to their own generals.
[01:35:45.382 --> 01:35:47.263]  I mean, look at how many generals have gone public.
[01:35:47.323 --> 01:35:53.066]  Six generals have said that Iraq is a disaster, that they told this administration not to do it.
[01:35:53.346 --> 01:35:54.427]  We were undermanned.
[01:35:54.787 --> 01:35:55.868]  We should not be there.
[01:35:56.068 --> 01:35:56.688]  And you know what?
[01:35:56.808 --> 01:35:58.249]  You know what's interesting right now, Alex?
[01:35:58.990 --> 01:36:08.245]  Some new generals are saying that what's happening in Lebanon right now is so explosive that if it gets out of control, America is in peril.
[01:36:08.625 --> 01:36:09.627]  Let me bring this up to you.
[01:36:10.585 --> 01:36:13.566]  A separate subject, but the pretext for all of this.
[01:36:13.586 --> 01:36:13.606]  9-11.
[01:36:13.826 --> 01:36:32.730]  I had the former head historian for the Marine Corps on, a full colonel, who of course is also deputy assistant secretary of defense, saying the 9-11 story doesn't hunt, and he's very conservative, that the evidence points towards the government being involved, supporting it, letting it happen.
[01:36:32.910 --> 01:36:34.750]  There's a whole spectrum of debate.
[01:36:35.110 --> 01:36:39.731]  We have Morgan Reynolds, head economist, Department of Labor, for this bush,
[01:36:40.512 --> 01:36:51.142]  We have members of the British Parliament, members of Blair's Cabinet, we have physicists, we have scientists, we have MI5 agents, we have the former top CIA advisor to George Bush Jr.
[01:36:51.162 --> 01:36:54.606]  and Ronald Reagan saying that the official story is a complete fraud.
[01:36:55.447 --> 01:36:57.209]  All of these people are going public about 9-11.
[01:36:57.229 --> 01:37:01.313]  9-11 has been the pretext to build all of this.
[01:37:01.833 --> 01:37:03.195]  Give us your take on how they're using 9-11.
[01:37:03.655 --> 01:37:16.958]  You know, I tell you what, I'm way behind the 9-11 stories that you're talking about there, other than the fact that what we're seeing happening in southern Lebanon right now, it's not happening by coincidence.
[01:37:17.018 --> 01:37:18.219]  The timing is everything.
[01:37:18.579 --> 01:37:24.680]  If you look at George Bush prior to 9-11, he was regarded as a total dolt.
[01:37:24.880 --> 01:37:28.141]  I mean, a complete... The guy was in office, what, a year?
[01:37:28.961 --> 01:37:30.582]  We had the stock market crash.
[01:37:30.602 --> 01:37:31.242]  He was sinking.
[01:37:31.502 --> 01:37:32.743]  He was absolutely sinking.
[01:37:32.883 --> 01:37:34.203]  Everything was failing on the guy.
[01:37:34.463 --> 01:37:36.344]  So all of a sudden, 9-11 changes all that.
[01:37:36.364 --> 01:37:40.206]  Well, this, in a sense, is kind of their new chance at a 9-11.
[01:37:40.586 --> 01:37:46.689]  It is to escalate the war to the point where Americans are so fearful that they say, we can't change horses in the middle of the stream.
[01:37:47.029 --> 01:37:55.375]  I mean, why would Hezbollah or Hamas carry out bombings in the U.S., as the neocons are saying they're sure to do, knowing that would bring in a military force to defeat them?
[01:37:55.976 --> 01:37:57.117]  No, they won't do that.
[01:37:57.157 --> 01:37:57.817]  They won't do it.
[01:37:57.837 --> 01:38:00.159]  But it's good front-page stuff.
[01:38:00.199 --> 01:38:02.421]  And unfortunately, the mass media buys it.
[01:38:02.441 --> 01:38:02.901]  The Fairmonger?
[01:38:03.221 --> 01:38:04.602]  Yeah, the mass media buys it.
[01:38:04.682 --> 01:38:07.164]  Fox News will cover this until you're sick.
[01:38:07.264 --> 01:38:15.110]  And everything that they get at, everything on Fox News, all those little trailers they have underneath the pictures, that all comes directly from the White House, man.
[01:38:15.330 --> 01:38:16.111]  Oh, that's admitted.
[01:38:16.151 --> 01:38:16.591]  Yeah.
[01:38:16.651 --> 01:38:18.832]  You know, Tony Snow is not there by mistake.
[01:38:19.093 --> 01:38:22.535]  Tony Snow is there because he's the guy that engineered all that.
[01:38:22.575 --> 01:38:26.178]  So when you watch Fox News, understand one thing is at work.
[01:38:26.498 --> 01:38:33.483]  It is nothing more than an arm of this administration, an arm that wants to get this damn country involved in World War III.
[01:38:33.503 --> 01:38:41.188]  Well, out of all the crimes they've committed, Mike, one of the biggest is, again, the Congressional Budget Office, General Accounting Office said this is illegal.
[01:38:41.972 --> 01:38:46.375]  Two years ago, in the last year, they spent another $1.6 billion on fake news.
[01:38:46.696 --> 01:38:53.681]  How can you believe anything they say when they're admittedly... I mean, Armstrong Williams is the tip of the tip of the tip of the iceberg.
[01:38:53.741 --> 01:38:59.125]  $245,000 to go out and act like he was an independent person promoting Bush's programs.
[01:38:59.745 --> 01:39:00.265]  But you know what?
[01:39:00.305 --> 01:39:01.306]  There's some good news here.
[01:39:01.346 --> 01:39:04.667]  The good news is people are actually turning to alternative media.
[01:39:05.448 --> 01:39:19.955]  60% of the American public, this is what they believe right now, 60% of the American public believe that the mass media doesn't have the ability to correctly give us the news because they're being stopped by government and corporations.
[01:39:19.975 --> 01:39:20.895]  And so what does Bush do?
[01:39:20.935 --> 01:39:24.677]  He moves in with taxes for the Internet, regulations, Internet coups.
[01:39:25.157 --> 01:39:25.998]  Exactly.
[01:39:26.198 --> 01:39:28.360]  Close off what we call citizens media.
[01:39:28.681 --> 01:39:31.464]  Citizens media is rising up to fill that big void.
[01:39:31.484 --> 01:39:33.025]  It's the market taking care of itself.
[01:39:33.105 --> 01:39:46.019]  Well, I'm not tooting my own horn, but if you go do web traffic analysis of prisonplanet.com, infowars.com, just my little sites run by one person apiece, prisonplanet.com is as big as the Dallas Morning News now.
[01:39:46.059 --> 01:39:46.279]  Oh, sure.
[01:39:46.579 --> 01:39:47.079]  Of course.
[01:39:47.419 --> 01:39:50.101]  People are looking for the real news right now, Alex.
[01:39:50.121 --> 01:39:51.481]  And that's part of this story.
[01:39:51.502 --> 01:39:53.783]  That's part of the southern Lebanon story right now.
[01:39:54.143 --> 01:39:56.204]  They're trying to find out what's really happening.
[01:39:56.524 --> 01:39:57.705]  And you have people like you.
[01:39:57.725 --> 01:40:00.106]  You've got people like Wayne Madsen out there that are reporting.
[01:40:00.726 --> 01:40:01.426]  Greg Pallas.
[01:40:01.486 --> 01:40:03.588]  All these people that are reporting what's really happening.
[01:40:03.928 --> 01:40:04.768]  And they're getting it.
[01:40:04.888 --> 01:40:14.433]  They understand that this whole thing in Lebanon was planned back in June when the Israelis met with Dick Cheney and Dick Cheney gave it his blessings.
[01:40:14.833 --> 01:40:18.094]  They know... Why are the neocons... I don't want to talk about election fraud, sir.
[01:40:18.434 --> 01:40:20.714]  Why are the... I mean, I've seen arrogance in government.
[01:40:21.114 --> 01:40:21.955]  That's part of the course.
[01:40:21.995 --> 01:40:25.595]  It's part of the... I mean, it's part of that animal.
[01:40:25.875 --> 01:40:35.537]  But just the insane arrogance where their own documents are public, all their crimes are public, and they just giggle and laugh and just expand the fraud.
[01:40:35.838 --> 01:40:39.438]  Well, right now they know they have a Supreme Court in their pocket.
[01:40:39.738 --> 01:40:42.399]  They know they have Congress in their pocket, a Senate in their pocket.
[01:40:42.799 --> 01:40:43.680]  We're good to go.
[01:40:58.696 --> 01:40:59.276]  Yeah, I think so.
[01:41:22.261 --> 01:41:31.128]  Well, now that you bring him up, you know, I'm a Texan, you're a Southerner, and I'm not knocking people in Connecticut or in Maine, but literally, I've been out to his ranch.
[01:41:31.188 --> 01:41:32.409]  It is a Hollywood set.
[01:41:32.429 --> 01:41:33.690]  He's scared of horses.
[01:41:34.511 --> 01:41:36.953]  And, you know, somebody's done a lot of cowboy work back in high school.
[01:41:37.393 --> 01:41:38.414]  It's insulting.
[01:41:38.594 --> 01:41:44.298]  I'm just tired of people saying, oh, look at Texas, you know, a village somewhere in Texas is missing an idiot.
[01:41:44.599 --> 01:41:45.659]  He is not ours.
[01:41:45.920 --> 01:41:47.941]  He does not come from the South or Texas.
[01:41:47.961 --> 01:41:48.702]  Yeah.
[01:41:49.442 --> 01:41:50.403]  You're absolutely right.
[01:41:50.423 --> 01:41:59.933]  Of course, when the Dixie Chicks tried to say that, if you really talked to them about what they meant when they attacked him, they said, look, he's an embarrassment to Texas.
[01:41:59.993 --> 01:42:01.495]  We're probably going to have them on the show soon.
[01:42:01.515 --> 01:42:01.976]  They're big fans.
[01:42:02.036 --> 01:42:03.017]  Oh, great, great.
[01:42:03.297 --> 01:42:04.618]  They're just such heroes.
[01:42:04.638 --> 01:42:06.160]  They are absolute heroes.
[01:42:06.220 --> 01:42:07.181]  Well, you notice what happened, too.
[01:42:07.221 --> 01:42:15.010]  They quit playing their CDs, their songs, and, in fact, I know their dad, and in the next year, their sales roughly doubled.
[01:42:15.070 --> 01:42:18.314]  So, I guess, in a way, it's kind of good to be blacklisted.
[01:42:18.334 --> 01:42:20.076]  Oh, man, we promote them like crazy.
[01:42:20.096 --> 01:42:22.979]  Matter of fact, one show we did, we had all of their music.
[01:42:23.340 --> 01:42:27.044]  Listen, Alex, can you imagine what courage that took?
[01:42:27.424 --> 01:42:30.585]  Can you imagine what kind of courage it took to make that stand?
[01:42:30.625 --> 01:42:31.465]  That was early on.
[01:42:31.545 --> 01:42:32.625]  Yeah, you and I do this.
[01:42:32.705 --> 01:42:36.686]  I mean, you know, we do this every day, but we're not out there trying to sell records.
[01:42:37.086 --> 01:42:41.947]  These people, their livelihood depended on it, and they went after this guy when they should have.
[01:42:42.768 --> 01:42:43.148]  Exactly.
[01:42:43.168 --> 01:42:45.508]  Let me bring something else into this.
[01:42:45.528 --> 01:42:52.150]  You know, when they should have done, according to conventional wisdom, what Britney Spears doing said, just don't question Bush, do whatever he says.
[01:42:52.170 --> 01:42:52.530]  Remember that?
[01:42:52.550 --> 01:42:52.750]  Yeah.
[01:42:52.790 --> 01:42:53.370]  What an idiot.
[01:42:53.430 --> 01:42:53.950]  What an idiot.
[01:42:53.990 --> 01:43:06.714]  But shifting gears yet again, if you're going to be arrogant, if you're going to set up an effective dictatorship, if you're going to circumvent people's liberties and the Constitution, you've got to somehow short-circuit the vote.
[01:43:07.134 --> 01:43:10.015]  And the problem with the election fraud is there's too much evidence.
[01:43:10.055 --> 01:43:13.316]  I mean, we've had their own employees go public and say it's a fraud.
[01:43:13.356 --> 01:43:14.776]  We've caught them stealing elections.
[01:43:14.816 --> 01:43:19.297]  We've had the heads of the companies in Ohio saying they're going to give the election to Bush.
[01:43:19.577 --> 01:43:21.218]  Then they do it, and...
[01:43:21.958 --> 01:43:33.551]  Still, some people in America, I think, can't believe the horror of the fact, just like you can't believe that Bayer puts AIDS in drugs on purpose, they just can't believe that our elections are being stolen.
[01:43:33.731 --> 01:43:34.632]  Can you speak to that?
[01:43:34.792 --> 01:43:41.660]  Yeah, Bobby Kennedy and I had to actually file a lawsuit a couple of weeks ago because the Democratic leadership didn't have enough guts to do it.
[01:43:41.980 --> 01:43:45.423]  The mainstream media is a story that they simply don't understand.
[01:43:45.443 --> 01:43:47.185]  They really don't understand the story.
[01:43:47.465 --> 01:43:49.407]  But if you believe that the U.S.
[01:43:49.427 --> 01:43:58.816]  has a system of legitimate voting that's any way superior to third world countries or banana republics, then you haven't followed these voting scandals since Bush was appointed president.
[01:43:59.116 --> 01:44:01.018]  I mean, quick, the 10,000 foot.
[01:44:01.359 --> 01:44:03.020]  Ohio.
[01:44:03.040 --> 01:44:11.570]  80,000 times votes were registered for John Kerry, but more than 80,000 times those same machines mystically registered those same votes for Bush.
[01:44:12.010 --> 01:44:17.916]  One jurisdiction in Ohio where there are only 800 registered voters had 4,000 Bush voters, had 4,000 registered for George Bush.
[01:44:21.560 --> 01:44:22.921]  And it's not just Republicans.
[01:44:23.181 --> 01:44:32.004]  It's going on in districts where you have something as simple as a developer who wants to have three new county commissioners put on because he wants a new development to come through.
[01:44:32.284 --> 01:44:34.624]  So it's very local, too.
[01:44:34.965 --> 01:44:36.065]  How does Senator Hagel...
[01:44:36.665 --> 01:44:48.853]  How is he the majority owner on the company where all the votes are cast in Nebraska, and then he is elected by his own machines when he was 15 points behind in his first election?
[01:44:48.913 --> 01:44:49.373]  Exactly.
[01:44:49.613 --> 01:44:50.014]  E-S-N-S.
[01:44:50.294 --> 01:44:51.655]  And then he lied about it.
[01:44:51.935 --> 01:44:59.860]  He went to Congress, raised his right hand, and lied to Congress about the fact he told them he didn't even have ownership in the company.
[01:45:00.240 --> 01:45:03.582]  This is a guy in charge of our politics in Washington these days.
[01:45:03.862 --> 01:45:04.883]  Or how about Odell?
[01:45:04.963 --> 01:45:06.464]  How about Wally Odell?
[01:45:06.784 --> 01:45:16.190]  Wally Odell with Diebold comes out, with Diebold, he comes out and he says, look, I've got to do everything I can to make sure that George Bush wins as president.
[01:45:16.410 --> 01:45:16.991]  And you know what?
[01:45:17.231 --> 01:45:18.952]  In Ohio, that's exactly what he did.
[01:45:21.334 --> 01:45:23.516]  But this is not a partisan issue, Alex.
[01:45:23.576 --> 01:45:24.777]  This is not a partisan issue.
[01:45:25.157 --> 01:45:26.559]  Both parties are doing this.
[01:45:26.919 --> 01:45:30.322]  And the truth is, it's destroying democracy.
[01:45:30.642 --> 01:45:38.109]  We can't have democracy if people someday are going to have to show up at polling booths and have people with M16s standing there.
[01:45:38.309 --> 01:45:39.070]  Here's a $64 million question.
[01:45:41.071 --> 01:45:50.678]  How do we remove these Diebold and Sequoia and other systems that have been absolutely certified to be scams?
[01:45:51.098 --> 01:45:53.659]  Well, the only way to do it is you have to take their money away.
[01:45:53.699 --> 01:45:55.401]  You have to do what Bobby and I are trying to do.
[01:45:56.441 --> 01:46:01.885]  What we learn in the tobacco litigation is the only thing that these people react to is to take their money away.
[01:46:02.675 --> 01:46:08.137]  The only way to do that is we're filing key TAM cases, whistleblower cases, all over the country.
[01:46:09.037 --> 01:46:10.617]  One by one, we're going to go after them.
[01:46:10.637 --> 01:46:12.378]  I've got to tell you something.
[01:46:12.498 --> 01:46:16.299]  I will be sitting across the table taking these people's depositions.
[01:46:16.639 --> 01:46:23.541]  They're going to have to answer questions that they never thought they'd have to answer because they knew we had a Republican Congress that wouldn't allow us to ask questions.
[01:46:23.621 --> 01:46:25.123]  And that's your big case that's coming up.
[01:46:25.223 --> 01:46:26.424]  We've got a bunch of them coming up.
[01:46:26.544 --> 01:46:29.067]  But what we're having to do is we're actually having to file these.
[01:46:29.087 --> 01:46:35.615]  So the key is get the depositions, drag these CEOs in, have the witnesses, get the documents, and sync them one by one.
[01:46:35.715 --> 01:46:39.800]  Exactly what we did on tobacco, exactly what I do on every pharmaceutical case I handle.
[01:46:40.160 --> 01:46:41.241]  That's the methodology.
[01:46:41.301 --> 01:46:43.364]  It's the only thing that these people react to.
[01:46:44.150 --> 01:46:44.950]  Well, I want to say this.
[01:46:45.050 --> 01:46:48.331]  Lawyers are a symptom of the society we're in.
[01:46:48.472 --> 01:47:00.496]  I believe, and I've said this on air, that I don't want any, quote, reform of the law system because all of these suits, that is in response to the out-of-control corruption of these corporations.
[01:47:00.516 --> 01:47:07.198]  Now, certainly, there are bad lawyers and bad cases and bad people out there, and there are frivolous lawsuits, but...
[01:47:07.658 --> 01:47:14.824]  I want to be able to go out and get a good lawyer as a friend of mine to defend me when a bad lawyer and a bad litigant comes after me.
[01:47:14.864 --> 01:47:22.890]  So when you hear these calls out there to restrict trial lawyers, that is to restrict one of the few remedies we've got left.
[01:47:23.210 --> 01:47:24.731]  Yeah, let me just tell you something.
[01:47:24.971 --> 01:47:27.073]  We're out of remedies on this voting machine.
[01:47:27.413 --> 01:47:31.316]  If Bobby and I fail on this litigation, we'll never know what happened.
[01:47:33.217 --> 01:47:33.938]  It's unbelievable.
[01:47:34.551 --> 01:47:35.231]  It's just unbelievable.
[01:47:35.251 --> 01:47:36.872]  Let's talk to BL in Texas.
[01:47:37.192 --> 01:47:38.093]  BL, thanks for holding.
[01:47:38.113 --> 01:47:39.113]  You're on the air with our guest.
[01:47:39.133 --> 01:47:39.514]  Go ahead.
[01:47:40.394 --> 01:47:40.654]  Alex.
[01:47:41.855 --> 01:47:42.075]  Yes.
[01:47:43.355 --> 01:47:50.239]  Since I've gotten back from the LA Symposium, I've given away over 50 of your Terror Storm videos.
[01:47:50.439 --> 01:47:50.779]  Oh, good.
[01:47:50.819 --> 01:47:51.139]  Thank you.
[01:47:51.539 --> 01:47:56.682]  I've gotten more positive feedback than I have in the eight years I've been giving away your films.
[01:47:58.003 --> 01:47:58.883]  It is your best work.
[01:47:59.263 --> 01:47:59.784]  Well, thank you.
[01:47:59.844 --> 01:48:02.025]  It's got a professional Hollywood Symphony score.
[01:48:02.145 --> 01:48:02.545]  It's got...
[01:48:03.623 --> 01:48:05.164]  But it's the information that's powerful.
[01:48:05.825 --> 01:48:06.585]  It's our best film.
[01:48:06.625 --> 01:48:06.926]  Thank you.
[01:48:07.486 --> 01:48:10.468]  Well, I've got 300 blank DVDs here waiting to burn.
[01:48:11.028 --> 01:48:20.615]  But let me preface my question on vote fraud by saying that I want to thank both of you for your good works.
[01:48:21.615 --> 01:48:30.301]  But given that three of the four branches of government have been unlawful since before the war for states' rights, before the 14th Amendment,
[01:48:30.939 --> 01:48:42.080]  The state legislatures no longer elect the senators, and somewhere between the third and fifth editions of Black's Law, the United States of America became the United States.
[01:48:43.360 --> 01:48:47.183]  Why should we care about vote fraud for an unlawful government?
[01:48:47.203 --> 01:48:47.883]  Well, let me just say this.
[01:48:47.903 --> 01:48:55.268]  There's been a lot of corruption, a lot of problems, a slow erosion of liberties, and then fights to try to get it back, and two steps forward, three steps back.
[01:48:55.628 --> 01:49:01.772]  But now we're reaching the flashpoint, the apex, the total takeover.
[01:49:02.132 --> 01:49:06.035]  And so you're right, there's all these other problems, but we've got to fix this one right now.
[01:49:06.335 --> 01:49:08.356]  This is the big enchilada, the big tomato.
[01:49:08.737 --> 01:49:09.317]  Comments, Mike?
[01:49:09.737 --> 01:49:14.279]  Yeah, I mean, America is... Our democracy is the envy of the world.
[01:49:14.319 --> 01:49:16.280]  At least it was six years ago.
[01:49:16.641 --> 01:49:17.921]  It was absolutely the envy of the world.
[01:49:17.961 --> 01:49:25.625]  And one reason that we were the envy of the world, our democracy was, is because you knew it was one man, one vote, as close as possible.
[01:49:26.566 --> 01:49:27.266]  When we lose that...
[01:49:28.141 --> 01:49:29.142]  It's all downhill from there.
[01:49:29.442 --> 01:49:31.884]  Well, I mean, they are destroying our republic and formal government.
[01:49:31.924 --> 01:49:33.966]  Our republic is being dismantled.
[01:49:33.986 --> 01:49:34.787]  B.L., anything else?
[01:49:34.967 --> 01:49:36.788]  Gentlemen, I don't want to live in a democracy.
[01:49:36.848 --> 01:49:40.091]  I want to live in a constitutional republic with states' rights.
[01:49:40.671 --> 01:49:42.793]  B.L., do you want to finish up briefly after the break?
[01:49:42.813 --> 01:49:45.155]  I'll give you a little bit after the break because I want to get where you're going.
[01:49:45.555 --> 01:49:45.916]  Stay with us.
[01:49:45.936 --> 01:49:46.456]  We'll be right back.
[01:49:57.137 --> 01:50:00.320]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[01:50:00.660 --> 01:50:02.582]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[01:50:02.982 --> 01:50:10.648]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:50:11.309 --> 01:50:18.374]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:50:18.774 --> 01:50:21.697]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran.
[01:50:22.037 --> 01:50:24.399]  The White House program to disseminate fake news.
[01:50:24.839 --> 01:50:25.620]  NSA spies.
[01:50:27.068 --> 01:50:30.190]  The latest 9-11 information and much, much more.
[01:50:30.490 --> 01:50:33.993]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:50:34.473 --> 01:50:36.374]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:50:36.714 --> 01:50:40.617]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:51:12.722 --> 01:51:13.383]  We're good to go.
[01:51:13.403 --> 01:51:13.743]  I think?
[01:51:29.216 --> 01:51:29.716]  That's right.
[01:51:29.876 --> 01:51:36.998]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.

[01:52:59.383 --> 01:53:00.103]  Final segment.
[01:53:00.123 --> 01:53:01.523]  I know I have the callers holding forever.
[01:53:01.543 --> 01:53:04.404]  We'll try to jam as many of you in as we can, Sasha, Mike, and others.
[01:53:04.464 --> 01:53:06.145]  But real fast, BL.com.
[01:53:06.866 --> 01:53:10.187]  Your point about us being a republic, absolutely.
[01:53:10.227 --> 01:53:15.089]  The point is the people's right in that democratic process is being removed.
[01:53:15.129 --> 01:53:16.650]  Finish up what you were saying, Mike, in Texas?
[01:53:17.110 --> 01:53:18.110]  I mean, BL in Texas?
[01:53:18.650 --> 01:53:23.072]  Well, democracy, as we all know, is three wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[01:53:23.332 --> 01:53:24.493]  I don't want to be a U.S.
[01:53:24.533 --> 01:53:26.473]  citizen, a 14th Amendment citizen.
[01:53:26.493 --> 01:53:33.256]  I want to be a citizen of a sovereign state that adheres to its original constitution and is a member of
[01:53:33.681 --> 01:53:37.742]  Of the Constitutional Republic of these United States of America.
[01:53:37.782 --> 01:53:38.402]  Thank you, B.L.
[01:53:38.442 --> 01:53:39.302]  I appreciate your call.
[01:53:39.903 --> 01:53:49.245]  Mike, he's making the point that, you know, since the amendment in 1913 to remove our senators to Washington, that the states have become vassals of the federal government.
[01:53:49.845 --> 01:53:53.686]  Yeah, well, you know, there's always been the conflict between federalism and states' rights.
[01:53:53.786 --> 01:53:59.247]  And, you know, unfortunately right now it's upside down on the federal side.
[01:53:59.767 --> 01:54:00.467]  Well, I agree with you.
[01:54:00.508 --> 01:54:02.048]  Sasha in Missouri, you're on the air.
[01:54:02.088 --> 01:54:02.408]  Welcome.
[01:54:02.952 --> 01:54:03.793]  Good afternoon, gentlemen.
[01:54:03.813 --> 01:54:05.435]  It's an honor to speak with such good doers.
[01:54:06.796 --> 01:54:07.477]  What's on your mind?
[01:54:08.257 --> 01:54:15.385]  My quick question is, how do we reconcile these obviously corrupted voting machines with the need to get these bad guys out of office by 2006?
[01:54:15.845 --> 01:54:18.668]  And will your court case happen in time to legitimize
[01:54:19.301 --> 01:54:19.701]  That election.
[01:54:20.181 --> 01:54:24.043]  The best we can hope for is that the case comes out from under seal.
[01:54:24.083 --> 01:54:25.204]  Right now it's under seal.
[01:54:25.244 --> 01:54:25.624]  The U.S.
[01:54:25.664 --> 01:54:26.325]  Attorney has it.
[01:54:26.365 --> 01:54:28.305]  We can't talk about it until it comes out.
[01:54:28.326 --> 01:54:36.930]  If it comes out under seal before this November election, this is some startling stuff, and even the indolent, idiotic mainstream media has to pick up on it.
[01:54:37.330 --> 01:54:38.010]  Thank you, Sasha.
[01:54:38.030 --> 01:54:39.151]  I appreciate that call.
[01:54:40.223 --> 01:54:41.644]  It's going to get more and more obvious, though.
[01:54:41.684 --> 01:54:52.550]  I mean, if we start having King George III, King George V, Jeb VIII, you know, Barbara X, and then the polls say 90% of us don't like them, it's going to be pretty obvious it's a fraud.
[01:54:53.751 --> 01:55:00.155]  Well, unfortunately, it has to be a Ralph Reed kind of deal where it's so heavy-handedly one side that they can't fix it.
[01:55:00.815 --> 01:55:02.136]  Mike in Florida, you're on the air.
[01:55:02.176 --> 01:55:02.596]  Go ahead.
[01:55:02.616 --> 01:55:04.077]  Hi, Alex.
[01:55:04.197 --> 01:55:07.859]  I just wanted to address something that I'm not sure anybody's really addressed.
[01:55:08.320 --> 01:55:08.660]  We have
[01:55:09.249 --> 01:55:12.651]  We have the New World Order that has a planned destruction of America.
[01:55:12.671 --> 01:55:31.321]  I believe part of that is that, for one, George Bush is not as ignorant as we think he is, and that really what we see going on in the Middle East right now could possibly be a planned destruction for the military, because our military is really the last great superpower that could even stand in the way of what they really want to do.
[01:55:31.461 --> 01:55:33.102]  Yeah, globalism, the globalists.
[01:55:33.122 --> 01:55:35.604]  I was just up at the Bilderberg meeting covering that a month ago in...
[01:55:39.748 --> 01:55:49.929]  Well, I think you give too much credit to George Bush.
[01:55:50.069 --> 01:55:54.290]  I interviewed Yossi Shiromi one time, who was his MBA Harvard professor.
[01:55:54.610 --> 01:55:57.671]  He said he's never met a duller wit in his life.
[01:55:58.131 --> 01:56:01.471]  So I think everything Bush does is basically knee-jerk.
[01:56:01.511 --> 01:56:04.772]  Well, he's certainly a puppet, but what about his handlers?
[01:56:04.792 --> 01:56:05.292]  They're cunning.
[01:56:05.842 --> 01:56:15.113]  Well, his handlers are cunning, but I think corporate America, the only reason I would disagree with where you're headed with that, is corporate America needs stability to make money.
[01:56:15.474 --> 01:56:18.077]  And at the end of the day, it's that money that they care about.
[01:56:18.982 --> 01:56:20.343]  Well, no, I agree with that statement.
[01:56:21.684 --> 01:56:24.466]  So is corporate America trying to pull Bush's chain back in?
[01:56:24.506 --> 01:56:25.607]  It seems like they're letting him go.
[01:56:26.107 --> 01:56:30.511]  Well, they're letting him go only because it's a quid pro quo.
[01:56:30.551 --> 01:56:31.191]  It's exchange.
[01:56:31.451 --> 01:56:34.253]  You give us multi-billion dollar tax cuts.
[01:56:34.614 --> 01:56:36.735]  You let us deregulate everything.
[01:56:37.035 --> 01:56:39.577]  You do whatever the hell you want to do on an international level.
[01:56:39.777 --> 01:56:41.098]  He never vetoes bills.
[01:56:41.819 --> 01:56:44.421]  He spent more money than all presidents before him combined.
[01:56:44.681 --> 01:56:45.762]  How is that conservative?
[01:56:46.320 --> 01:56:48.861]  Well, it's not conservative.
[01:56:48.881 --> 01:56:59.603]  The Republican Party really used to stand for something that was real, and that was that fiscal conservatives were never willing to start a unilateral war.
[01:56:59.623 --> 01:57:05.124]  They were never willing to escalate and have adventurism determine where we're going.
[01:57:05.344 --> 01:57:07.205]  But it's not a Republican Party anymore.
[01:57:07.225 --> 01:57:08.105]  It's a corporatist party.
[01:57:08.485 --> 01:57:11.227]  Well, Mike Papantonio, it's been a real honor to have you.
[01:57:11.247 --> 01:57:18.030]  I know you're a very busy man, and I hope folks will tune into your Saturday program from 5 to 7 p.m.
[01:57:18.130 --> 01:57:22.172]  Eastern on the Ring of Fire on Air America stations around the country.
[01:57:24.474 --> 01:57:25.794]  Well, thank you for the invitation.
[01:57:25.834 --> 01:57:26.915]  You do great work.
[01:57:26.975 --> 01:57:31.597]  I mean, you were doing this before anybody thought about doing it, and that paves the way for us.
[01:57:31.617 --> 01:57:32.298]  God bless you, Mike.
[01:57:32.338 --> 01:57:32.658]  Take care.

[01:57:45.793 --> 01:57:47.354]  You want answers?
[01:57:47.634 --> 01:57:49.116]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.885 --> 01:58:01.507]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.067 --> 01:58:06.168]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:06.308 --> 01:58:07.269]  We know Israel.
[01:58:08.469 --> 01:58:15.292]  We know Israel's bought massive amounts of DU weaponry, munitions, from the United States and are using them right now in Lebanon.
[01:58:15.392 --> 01:58:17.593]  Dr. Doug Rockey, who wrote the book.
[01:58:18.243 --> 01:58:23.206]  On DU, for the Pentagon, their head of their DU program will be joining us in the next segment.
[01:58:23.426 --> 01:58:29.330]  I wanted to roll this international news piece concerning the targeting of emergency vehicles, ambulances.
[01:58:29.350 --> 01:58:30.851]  You know about the UN getting bombed.
[01:58:31.111 --> 01:58:31.611]  Here it is.
[01:58:33.172 --> 01:58:36.915]  In the middle of the night, another dreadful landmark in this conflict.
[01:58:37.775 --> 01:58:43.659]  Lebanese ambulance men, shocked and bleeding, brought in as casualties to a hospital in Tyre.
[01:58:44.614 --> 01:58:52.876]  They were hurt when Israeli aircraft rocketed two ambulance crews who were transferring wounded civilians in a village ten miles outside the city.
[01:58:54.096 --> 01:59:03.119]  The medics say that at the time of the attack their ambulances were stationary with their blue lights flashing and spotlights shining on their Red Cross flags.
[01:59:04.099 --> 01:59:12.061]  Then, one after the other, the two vehicles were hit, but two of the injured civilians in the ambulances received terrible additional wounds.
[01:59:12.699 --> 01:59:15.701]  This man had a leg severed by one of the two blasts.
[01:59:16.161 --> 01:59:20.144]  His 12 year old son suffered brain injuries and severe burns.
[01:59:21.025 --> 01:59:25.328]  The Lebanese ambulance crews have shown extraordinary courage in the last two weeks.
[01:59:26.048 --> 01:59:30.451]  But not surprisingly, some are now reluctant to go outside the city of Tyre.
[01:59:31.432 --> 01:59:40.458]  On the face of it, it is difficult to understand just how the Israeli military could possibly have mistaken two clearly marked ambulances for a legitimate military target.
[01:59:40.891 --> 01:59:44.893]  And that is certainly a question that the International Red Cross will be seeking answers to.
[01:59:44.913 --> 01:59:50.957]  But the practical effect is that medical aid for the people of South Lebanon has been sharply reduced.
[01:59:51.717 --> 01:59:54.839]  Well, I'm joined now by Captain Jacob Dalal from the Israeli Army.
[01:59:54.899 --> 01:59:56.740]  Well, we've seen it there, haven't we, Captain Dalal?
[01:59:56.760 --> 02:00:00.843]  This can't go on, this indiscriminate slaughter of Lebanese civilians.
[02:00:03.004 --> 02:00:05.165]  We have nothing against the Lebanese civilians.
[02:00:05.565 --> 02:00:08.307]  We never intentionally target civilians.
[02:00:08.709 --> 02:00:10.970]  And certainly not ambulances or aid workers.
[02:00:11.330 --> 02:00:17.953]  But there's a context for all... With the greatest respect, we're talking about the Israeli army.
[02:00:17.993 --> 02:00:27.757]  Do you accept that hitting a Red Cross ambulance and a convoy of civilians fleeing are acts that are flagrant breaches of the rules of war?
[02:00:28.677 --> 02:00:32.919]  We never intentionally target civilians or ambulances.
[02:00:33.039 --> 02:00:36.241]  And you've also seen the effects of those Israeli strikes.
[02:00:36.261 --> 02:00:37.121]  What do you make of it all?
[02:00:39.028 --> 02:00:50.219]  Well I can tell you that just a few moments ago I actually saw an amateur video taken by a member of the ambulance service, a video which ITV News viewers will be seeing later tonight, of the effects of the Israeli strike on those two ambulances.
[02:00:50.739 --> 02:01:00.949]  And from a quick glance at it, it's just arrived, I would say that those ambulances were straight from the air by helicopter fire, possibly some sort of machine gun or cannon fire which punched holes in the roof.
[02:01:01.310 --> 02:01:02.331]  And as I said in my report,
[02:01:03.411 --> 02:01:13.473]  As new pictures emerge tonight of the moment the convoy was attacked, the UN tells ITV News that Israel is breaking the rules of war.
[02:01:13.653 --> 02:01:20.435]  But the air attack on two Red Cross ambulances has increased the controversy surrounding the Israeli assault on Lebanon.
[02:01:21.435 --> 02:01:25.656]  We never intentionally target civilians or ambulances.
[02:01:26.266 --> 02:01:35.673]  The ambulances were hit at around midnight last night as their crews transferred wounded civilians from one vehicle to another in a village east of Tyre.
[02:01:36.474 --> 02:01:40.497]  We never intentionally target civilians or ambulances.
[02:01:40.517 --> 02:01:42.698]  That's several of those reports kind of strung together.
[02:01:43.099 --> 02:01:47.562]  You can see the video up there on prisonplanet.com and infowars.com right now.
[02:01:48.102 --> 02:01:50.804]  Hey, show us the helicopter gun camera footage then.
[02:01:51.925 --> 02:01:52.906]  You don't target civilians.
[02:01:53.519 --> 02:01:58.922]  And of course they rocketed, bombed, and used artillery to totally destroy the UN base.
[02:02:00.203 --> 02:02:07.288]  They know exactly what they're doing, and I guess they'll just feed us these ridiculous one-liners about, we never intentionally target.
[02:02:08.409 --> 02:02:08.729]  Really!
[02:02:10.050 --> 02:02:13.832]  And you never intentionally run over American citizens with bulldozers either.
[02:02:15.573 --> 02:02:17.494]  But we have all these troops and all these documents.
[02:02:17.895 --> 02:02:19.956]  In Iraq, where our soldiers have been ordered to kill...
[02:02:21.215 --> 02:02:23.776]  Men, women, and children quote everyone in the villages.
[02:02:24.896 --> 02:02:25.776]  It's the same thing.
[02:02:26.777 --> 02:02:29.738]  Barbarous crimes being committed.
[02:02:30.718 --> 02:02:33.859]  It's a crime when a suicide bomber blows up a bus of civilians.
[02:02:34.459 --> 02:02:35.759]  It's a crime what Israel's doing.
[02:02:35.779 --> 02:02:37.920]  You do not target civilians.
[02:02:37.940 --> 02:02:38.120]  That's 101.
[02:02:39.680 --> 02:02:41.021]  We'll be back with Dr. Doug Rocky.
[02:02:41.041 --> 02:02:41.401]  Stay with us.
[02:02:48.724 --> 02:02:51.906]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[02:02:52.267 --> 02:02:54.188]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[02:02:54.548 --> 02:03:02.234]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:03:02.894 --> 02:03:09.939]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:03:10.359 --> 02:03:13.301]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran.
[02:03:13.682 --> 02:03:15.983]  A White House program to disseminate fake news.
[02:03:16.423 --> 02:03:16.904]  NSA spies.
[02:03:18.658 --> 02:03:21.799]  The latest 9-11 information and much, much more.
[02:03:22.060 --> 02:03:25.562]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:03:26.042 --> 02:03:27.943]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:03:28.303 --> 02:03:32.206]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:03:45.442 --> 02:03:48.703]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[02:03:48.763 --> 02:03:52.924]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[02:03:53.204 --> 02:03:55.984]  But if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[02:03:56.164 --> 02:03:58.565]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[02:03:58.765 --> 02:04:07.407]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[02:04:07.607 --> 02:04:08.947]  The Berkey Light is different.
[02:04:09.147 --> 02:04:13.268]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[02:04:13.568 --> 02:04:14.069]  We're good to go.
[02:04:33.666 --> 02:04:41.752]  Get the Advanced Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:04:42.432 --> 02:04:43.753]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:04:45.154 --> 02:04:49.197]  People who use Cardivite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[02:04:49.397 --> 02:04:52.799]  For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself time-tested.
[02:04:52.980 --> 02:04:56.402]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite.
[02:04:56.713 --> 02:04:59.956]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[02:04:59.976 --> 02:05:05.460]  This basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the diseases that we see.
[02:05:05.480 --> 02:05:15.127]  When we do our program, you know, herbal formulas like Cardavite, and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill, now going for a regular job a few months later, we know we're doing something right.
[02:05:15.248 --> 02:05:16.549]  It's a well-thought-out formula.
[02:05:16.569 --> 02:05:22.033]  I mean, the idea of it working on yeast and metals both at the same time and liver function is dead on.
[02:05:22.512 --> 02:05:26.954]  You'll find, I think, that it'll work more than just on heart problems and circulation problems.
[02:05:26.974 --> 02:05:28.414]  It'll work on other problems as well.
[02:05:28.574 --> 02:05:32.396]  For more information, call 1-877-928-8822 or visit our website at www.heartdrop.com.

[02:05:46.747 --> 02:05:52.790]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:05:53.391 --> 02:05:56.413]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:57.933 --> 02:06:02.456]  His bio is just too prolific to cover all of it.
[02:06:03.296 --> 02:06:09.320]  Dr. Doug Rockey, we have links to it up on Infowars.com and some of the great reportage he's put out.
[02:06:10.510 --> 02:06:17.653]  Headline here, Depleted Uranium Situation Worsens Requiring Immediate Action by President Bush, Prime Minister Blair, and Prime Minister Olbert.
[02:06:18.833 --> 02:06:22.675]  And there's also reports coming out that DU is being used right now by Israel.
[02:06:22.695 --> 02:06:23.395]  We know they bought it.
[02:06:23.995 --> 02:06:25.676]  Dr. Doug Rockey earned his Ph.D.
[02:06:25.716 --> 02:06:28.637]  in Physics and Technology Education at the University of Illinois.
[02:06:28.657 --> 02:06:35.740]  His military career has spanned four decades to include combat duty during the Vietnam War and Gulf War.
[02:06:36.520 --> 02:06:36.640]  One.
[02:06:37.671 --> 02:06:39.212]  Doug served as a member of the U.S.
[02:06:39.292 --> 02:06:49.577]  Army Medical Command, Nuclear Biological Chemical, NBC Teaching, Medical Response, and Special Operations Team, and with the Depleted Uranium Assessment Team during the Gulf War.
[02:06:50.237 --> 02:06:51.458]  He was the U.S.
[02:06:51.558 --> 02:06:53.479]  Army's Depleted Uranium Project Director.
[02:06:53.619 --> 02:06:54.339]  Did you hear that?
[02:06:54.759 --> 02:06:55.019]  From 1994 to 1995.
[02:06:56.966 --> 02:07:01.668]  He has developed the congressionally mandated educational and training materials and wrote U.S.
[02:07:01.728 --> 02:07:04.429]  Army Regulation 700-48 and the U.S.
[02:07:04.489 --> 02:07:07.510]  Army's command task for DU incidents.
[02:07:08.010 --> 02:07:12.552]  Doug has taught nuclear, biological, and chemical warfare and emergency medicine for 20 years.
[02:07:13.253 --> 02:07:14.613]  Folks, it just goes on and on.
[02:07:15.193 --> 02:07:15.994]  I can't read all this.
[02:07:16.014 --> 02:07:21.856]  He's been on ABC, CBS News, History Channel, A&E, PBS, testified for the U.S.
[02:07:21.916 --> 02:07:24.077]  Senate National Academy of Science.
[02:07:25.066 --> 02:07:25.326]  U.S.
[02:07:25.346 --> 02:07:26.787]  House of Representatives, U.S.
[02:07:26.807 --> 02:07:28.608]  Department of Transportation, FAA, U.S.
[02:07:28.628 --> 02:07:29.908]  Department of Defense, U.S.
[02:07:29.928 --> 02:07:32.990]  General Accounting Office, Department of Veterans Affairs, British Royal Society.
[02:07:33.010 --> 02:07:37.352]  I mean, you've got to be a big shot to talk to the British Royal Society.
[02:07:38.112 --> 02:07:38.992]  The head of your field.
[02:07:40.853 --> 02:07:42.314]  It's as prestigious as it gets.
[02:07:43.027 --> 02:07:44.007]  British House of Lords.
[02:07:44.087 --> 02:07:45.008]  I just can't read it all.
[02:07:45.328 --> 02:07:48.289]  And he'll tell you that we're all being radiated.
[02:07:48.349 --> 02:07:49.449]  Lung cancer is exploding.
[02:07:49.489 --> 02:07:50.409]  It's all over the air.
[02:07:50.449 --> 02:07:51.409]  It's totally deadly.
[02:07:51.910 --> 02:07:53.110]  It's killed a bunch of his team.
[02:07:53.410 --> 02:07:56.251]  Well, Dr. Rocky, you're joining us today graciously.
[02:07:56.291 --> 02:07:57.151]  Thank you for coming on.
[02:07:57.411 --> 02:08:10.415]  For laymen out there that don't know what this is, and for those that hear neocons say it's not bad for you, will you please tell us what this uranium is, how much has been used, and what we're facing, and now what Israel's doing?
[02:08:10.979 --> 02:08:11.439]  Yes, sir.
[02:08:11.659 --> 02:08:27.486]  Depleted uranium is the byproduct of the uranium enrichment process where the United States and Great Britain and Canada, etc., achieve or obtain fissionable uranium to make nuclear weapons and reactor fuel.
[02:08:28.026 --> 02:08:32.888]  Over 99% of everything that goes into the enrichment process is pure waste.
[02:08:33.428 --> 02:08:34.629]  It's uranium hexafluoride.
[02:08:35.189 --> 02:08:37.590]  It is a radioactive, toxic poison.
[02:08:38.360 --> 02:08:46.283]  And what has happened is the United States and Great Britain and Australia and Canada and now Israel, isn't that great?
[02:08:47.123 --> 02:08:51.985]  Take this and make uranium munitions and then use them against civilians and military targets.
[02:08:54.906 --> 02:09:00.628]  We have seen more than a quadrupling of dirt defects in Iraq, a tripling in Kosovo and surrounding areas.
[02:09:00.948 --> 02:09:06.330]  Talk about what we medically know this is doing to populations and then let's get into Israel.
[02:09:07.225 --> 02:09:13.430]  Well, firsthand, what we know from firsthand experience and what happened to those of us in Gulf War I and when we did the research for the U.S.
[02:09:13.510 --> 02:09:16.593]  Army, is the first thing that hits you is the respiratory problems.
[02:09:16.613 --> 02:09:17.634]  Then you have the rashes.
[02:09:18.294 --> 02:09:23.178]  Then you start having the permanent lung damage within a few months because of the radiation plus the chemical toxicity.
[02:09:23.779 --> 02:09:25.260]  Then you have the neurological problems.
[02:09:25.280 --> 02:09:27.002]  You have the gastrointestinal problems.
[02:09:27.522 --> 02:09:29.804]  You have the calcium replacement in the bones.
[02:09:29.844 --> 02:09:33.347]  You have decalcification of the bones and the teeth because the uranium is a bone seeker.
[02:09:34.065 --> 02:09:34.265]  Thank you.
[02:09:34.285 --> 02:09:34.526]  Thank you.
[02:09:55.732 --> 02:09:58.513]  I read it off the Library of Congress website about a year ago.
[02:09:58.533 --> 02:09:59.513]  I forget the exact name.
[02:09:59.993 --> 02:10:03.255]  What's that post-World War II, 1945 document?
[02:10:03.295 --> 02:10:05.115]  Is it called Dirty Bullets, Dirty Bombs?
[02:10:05.455 --> 02:10:09.577]  And they talk about gassing whole areas with uranium or using it in munitions.
[02:10:10.057 --> 02:10:11.757]  What's the name of that?
[02:10:11.797 --> 02:10:13.778]  If you place it, my memory fails me.
[02:10:13.798 --> 02:10:15.399]  But they've been talking about this for a while.
[02:10:15.499 --> 02:10:16.259]  And secondarily...
[02:10:17.319 --> 02:10:20.542]  I've read mining manuals written by the federal government in the mid-80s.
[02:10:21.063 --> 02:10:22.545]  I've read documents written in the early 90s.
[02:10:22.565 --> 02:10:25.367]  They say it's deadly poison, particulate, and radioactive.
[02:10:25.848 --> 02:10:30.393]  Before they admitted it was bad, when did it change and they just said it was nutritious?
[02:10:31.854 --> 02:10:35.678]  Nutritious is exactly how I got on Dan Rather the first time.
[02:10:35.698 --> 02:10:38.561]  That's exactly how I got there with Dan Rather back in 1998.
[02:10:40.973 --> 02:10:54.759]  Well, in 1943, the Groves Memorandum, the S2 Committee assigned to the Manhattan Project, specifically requested or directed the United States use radioactive materials to contaminate air, water, and soil, cause all the adverse health effects to end the war in Europe.
[02:10:55.459 --> 02:10:57.200]  Absolute cut-and-dry directive.
[02:10:58.040 --> 02:11:00.381]  And, obviously, they went on to make the nuclear weapon.
[02:11:00.561 --> 02:11:02.602]  You know, they had to obtain all this material.
[02:11:03.015 --> 02:11:05.657]  Again, 99% of the stuff that goes in is pure waste.
[02:11:05.797 --> 02:11:11.161]  But the key is, back in the 40s, they knew what the weapon was, and they said it's a permanent salting of the earth.
[02:11:12.182 --> 02:11:12.903]  Absolutely correct.
[02:11:12.983 --> 02:11:17.106]  And speaking with the last living gods of the Manhattan Project, they have thoroughly confirmed that.
[02:11:19.708 --> 02:11:21.049]  So they've known for 60 plus years.
[02:11:21.089 --> 02:11:21.669]  Please continue.
[02:11:22.270 --> 02:11:22.810]  Absolutely.
[02:11:23.211 --> 02:11:27.314]  Well, back in 1973 and 1974, the Israelis used uranium emissions for the very first time in the Sinai.
[02:11:30.672 --> 02:11:32.794]  Against the Egyptians in the Arab-Israeli War.
[02:11:33.434 --> 02:11:36.437]  Extraordinarily effective, destroyed all our armor, everything out there.
[02:11:36.937 --> 02:11:45.424]  The reports that we then worked on and based our extensive research on and use of uranium munitions came from that 73 and 74 report on that use.
[02:11:46.165 --> 02:11:48.006]  The adverse health effects were observed and known.
[02:11:48.026 --> 02:11:50.408]  The environmental effects were known and all that stuff.
[02:11:51.149 --> 02:11:56.473]  We then used it extraordinarily effective during Gulf War I. We were going to use it in Somalia, but our team got that stopped.
[02:11:56.513 --> 02:11:57.574]  We talked the Army out of it.
[02:11:58.183 --> 02:11:58.543]  Yeah, I saw that.
[02:11:58.563 --> 02:11:58.703]  Mm-hmm.
[02:12:28.975 --> 02:12:33.436]  Back in a couple of years ago, just months after it all started, the U.S.
[02:12:33.496 --> 02:12:39.858]  Army thoroughly confirmed they had used over 500 tons of uranium munitions in just the first few months in Iraq.
[02:12:40.278 --> 02:12:41.459]  That's the shock and awe.
[02:12:42.139 --> 02:12:42.499]  The U.S.
[02:12:42.539 --> 02:12:56.103]  Army thoroughly confirmed in that that the GBU-28, which is a precision-guided bomb, if you will, 5,000 pounds of explosives, contains a depleted uranium warhead.
[02:12:57.071 --> 02:12:58.512]  Again, these are the bunker busters.
[02:12:59.432 --> 02:13:02.973]  Well, lo and behold, last week, guess what the United States delivered to Israel?
[02:13:04.774 --> 02:13:08.235]  Over 100 GBU-28s to use against targets in Lebanon.
[02:13:10.156 --> 02:13:17.899]  Now, I want to bring this down to a personal level and talk about what you've been through, what happened to your team dealing with this stuff, and why you went public years ago.
[02:13:17.959 --> 02:13:24.362]  But first, I was out at Crawford last year talking to neocon idiots who aren't real conservatives, folks.
[02:13:25.163 --> 02:13:30.348]  And some of them, a few of them, had been in the first Gulf War, and I brought up DU, and they said, I was all around it.
[02:13:30.388 --> 02:13:30.808]  I love it.
[02:13:30.848 --> 02:13:31.789]  It isn't bad for me.
[02:13:33.110 --> 02:13:33.851]  I feel great.
[02:13:33.871 --> 02:13:35.432]  And I said, listen, it really is hurting the tribes.
[02:13:35.472 --> 02:13:36.313]  The manuals say it.
[02:13:36.713 --> 02:13:38.455]  They're like, shut up, commie liar.
[02:13:38.515 --> 02:13:39.115]  It's good.
[02:13:39.596 --> 02:13:43.239]  What would you, as the head of the DU program, tell them about it?
[02:13:43.299 --> 02:13:45.080]  And then personally, what would you tell them?
[02:13:45.801 --> 02:13:49.984]  Well, first off, they haven't completed all the education and training that's mandated by the U.S.
[02:13:50.045 --> 02:13:51.226]  Army that I wrote for the U.S.
[02:13:51.266 --> 02:13:51.486]  Army.
[02:13:52.040 --> 02:13:53.000]  Which ended up being for the U.S.
[02:13:53.020 --> 02:13:55.441]  Department of Defense, which ended up being adopted by NATO.
[02:13:56.082 --> 02:13:56.802]  They didn't do it.
[02:13:57.682 --> 02:14:13.708]  And the other thing, too, is anybody that thinks that you can expose, inhale, ingest, absorb, and get uranium shrapnel into your body that has both a radioactive toxicity and is chemically toxic, worse than eating lead paint dust, well, if you think this is not harmful, then you're flat wrong.
[02:14:14.779 --> 02:14:22.024]  And it always has been and always will be, and it's going to continue to be, because you can't clean it up, and you can't... What's the half-life?
[02:14:22.044 --> 02:14:22.825]  Four and a half billion?
[02:14:23.205 --> 02:14:30.210]  Yeah, one half-life is four and a half billion years, but you've got to remember, in physics, you have to go through ten half-lives before it's considered relatively safe.
[02:14:30.950 --> 02:14:32.131]  So that's 45 billion years.
[02:14:32.171 --> 02:14:34.553]  Now, the Earth is only four and a half billion years old to begin with.
[02:14:36.414 --> 02:14:37.375]  That's unbelievable.
[02:14:37.495 --> 02:14:40.277]  And now we've got ten proving grounds in the U.S.
[02:14:40.377 --> 02:14:40.757]  using it.
[02:14:41.217 --> 02:14:42.859]  We've got it being used all over the world.
[02:14:42.899 --> 02:14:51.585]  Now they're putting it in smaller and smaller munitions, in the smaller heavy machine guns, smaller cannons on the Bradley fighting vehicles, on the Marine Warriors.
[02:14:51.825 --> 02:14:55.988]  They're serving it out everywhere and using it in more spots, I discovered, all over the U.S.
[02:14:56.008 --> 02:15:02.713]  We're seeing a total ramping up with our nuclear waste, and then now radiation detectors in, what, England and the U.S.
[02:15:02.733 --> 02:15:05.775]  have picked up massive increases in DU particulate, Doctor?
[02:15:06.215 --> 02:15:07.516]  That is absolutely correct.
[02:15:07.536 --> 02:15:23.363]  The incredible work of one of the great scientists in the world, Dr. Chris Busby, and all everybody else, thoroughly confirmed that the uranium dust and everything that was dispersed throughout Iraq and the Middle East was dispersed around the world and got as far as England.
[02:15:23.843 --> 02:15:28.906]  One of the funniest things, the head of the British Royal Society, Dr. Brian Spratt, and Brian and I have worked together for years.
[02:15:28.946 --> 02:15:31.187]  We've done radio shows together and all this stuff, TV.
[02:15:32.662 --> 02:15:34.263]  Well, you know, it's not the uranium weapons.
[02:15:34.323 --> 02:15:39.026]  It's all just all the standard uranium that's in the soil that got dispersed up.
[02:15:39.106 --> 02:15:46.111]  Well, you forget to say that, you know, there was 375 tons dispersed in Gulf War I, continued throughout up to the period.
[02:15:46.698 --> 02:15:50.901]  And probably upwards of 2,000 tons in Gulf War II up to this date.
[02:15:51.281 --> 02:15:56.844]  Now, I saw the number a few years ago in mainstream news of the equivalent of 44,000 Hiroshima A-bombs.
[02:15:57.024 --> 02:15:58.485]  They've used a lot more since then.
[02:15:58.766 --> 02:16:01.207]  How many equivalent A-bombs are we talking about now?
[02:16:01.607 --> 02:16:02.108]  Well, I don't know.
[02:16:02.148 --> 02:16:05.250]  You have to go into the relatively quantity amount of radioactive materials.
[02:16:05.270 --> 02:16:10.573]  You have to remember, in an atomic bomb, and I will not go into that, use relatively a small amount of mass.
[02:16:11.453 --> 02:16:11.774]  Okay?
[02:16:12.094 --> 02:16:13.975]  In each DEU weapon, for example...
[02:16:14.577 --> 02:16:19.379]  The tank, Abrams tank fires, and now the Israeli tanks fires a DU round.
[02:16:19.479 --> 02:16:19.839]  Sabo.
[02:16:20.459 --> 02:16:23.580]  Yeah, every single round is over 10 pounds of solid uranium.
[02:16:24.760 --> 02:16:26.721]  Now the bunker buster is 5,000 pounds.
[02:16:28.681 --> 02:16:40.005]  You know, now we have the GBU-28, the Army's confirmed that, on-site measurements in Iraq thoroughly confirm that it's a radioactive bomb, and the shrapnel is there after its use, and it's a problem and everything else, so it's all there.
[02:16:40.740 --> 02:16:44.983]  So now the other thing that we have is thorough photographic confirmation.
[02:16:45.003 --> 02:16:55.729]  I want to repeat, photographic confirmation of Israeli tankers loading uranium rounds into Israeli tanks and using them in Lebanon, along with the GBU-28.
[02:16:56.129 --> 02:16:59.231]  And we've got your article documenting all that up on Infowars.com.
[02:16:59.271 --> 02:17:02.513]  So they take delivery of the big 5,000-pound bunker busters.
[02:17:03.274 --> 02:17:11.500]  I guess each one of its 5,000 pounds, equivalent of hundreds of the little Hiroshima or Nagasaki, just a few pounds in those, and then now they've got the Sabo rounds.
[02:17:11.961 --> 02:17:16.484]  How much do those Abrams M1A standard shell weigh?
[02:17:16.985 --> 02:17:19.727]  Well, each one contains over 10 pounds of solid uranium.
[02:17:20.087 --> 02:17:24.190]  Then the Bradley Fighting Vehicle has a round where every one's a half pound.
[02:17:24.230 --> 02:17:29.394]  The A-10 Warthog aircraft fires at 4,000 rounds a minute, where each one's three-quarters of a pound.
[02:17:29.915 --> 02:17:31.436]  Then the Barrett machine gun,
[02:17:32.202 --> 02:17:33.303]  You know the Barrett .50 Cal?
[02:17:33.363 --> 02:17:33.643]  Yes.
[02:17:33.944 --> 02:17:37.687]  Oh, God, the Barrett people brag about how well the DU round works in their rifle.
[02:17:38.929 --> 02:17:40.390]  We'll be right back with this insanity.
[02:17:40.690 --> 02:17:41.431]  Stay with us, Doctor.

[02:21:49.411 --> 02:21:50.992]  This show is documented.
[02:21:51.472 --> 02:21:54.752]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:21:55.253 --> 02:22:02.254]  A point I always mean to make about DU, with these tens of thousands of tons being used all over the place and in proving grounds...
[02:22:03.357 --> 02:22:16.910]  Is that the media is always hyping that terrorists could steal some x-ray elements and strap them around some TNT and blow it up in Chicago or Dallas or something and radiate a few blocks and oh no.
[02:22:17.771 --> 02:22:19.492]  Then I went and actually looked up what a dirty bomb would do.
[02:22:19.512 --> 02:22:22.274]  It would probably make you sick, but if you got medical treatment, you'd be all right.
[02:22:22.294 --> 02:22:24.335]  It might reduce your life by 10, 15 years.
[02:22:24.375 --> 02:22:25.916]  That's what the experts were saying.
[02:22:26.276 --> 02:22:27.096]  So it's really hype.
[02:22:27.176 --> 02:22:29.958]  But meanwhile, real dirty bombs are going off everywhere.
[02:22:30.198 --> 02:22:32.900]  Dr. Doug Rocky, can you comment on that and then get into what we know about Israel?
[02:22:33.440 --> 02:22:41.985]  Well, very clearly, the Office of Homeland Security and their new guidelines and directive very specifically state the deliberate use of any radioactive materials.
[02:22:42.546 --> 02:22:50.093]  Dispersal of anything now is absolutely illegal, and yet it's considered a dirty bomb, and it's absolutely a crime against humanity.
[02:22:50.693 --> 02:22:52.395]  And we've just done it over and over again.
[02:22:52.715 --> 02:22:53.996]  So now we come to Israel.
[02:22:55.578 --> 02:22:57.840]  Israel went into Lebanon, literally destroying Lebanon.
[02:22:58.440 --> 02:23:04.506]  On an earlier segment, as I was listening in, you have Israelis saying, we never target civilians, we never target civilians.
[02:23:05.247 --> 02:23:08.890]  Well, you know, well, right away, you know, Jesus, they blow them up all over the place.
[02:23:09.542 --> 02:23:11.823]  There's video of them walking up splattering kids.
[02:23:12.243 --> 02:23:12.823]  That's correct.
[02:23:12.843 --> 02:23:17.384]  They absolutely have been happening for a long time, including using tanks to run over American citizens.
[02:23:18.185 --> 02:23:20.165]  That's just a given thing with Rachel Corey.
[02:23:20.805 --> 02:23:27.347]  And so what we have now is deliberate use of radioactive munitions, depleted uranium munitions, which are illegal, according to the United Nations.
[02:23:27.387 --> 02:23:28.308]  But I want to stop you.
[02:23:28.588 --> 02:23:29.168]  I want to stop you.
[02:23:29.188 --> 02:23:36.470]  They're using these on bunkers and pillboxes, and then the Israeli troops go into there minutes after they've cleared them and breathe the aerosolized... I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:23:37.273 --> 02:23:38.113]  Yeah, and they do.
[02:23:38.214 --> 02:23:40.715]  So what we've got is we've got all the Lebanese being affected.
[02:23:40.735 --> 02:23:42.536]  We've got all the women and children being affected.
[02:23:42.956 --> 02:23:44.697]  We've got all the Israelis being affected.
[02:23:44.757 --> 02:23:48.959]  And the areas over there are so small, you're going to have the whole region affected and contaminated.
[02:23:49.399 --> 02:23:58.024]  We absolutely know from firsthand research and production that the National Lead Site up in Albany, New York, when it was produced in DU, had a release.
[02:23:58.764 --> 02:24:03.647]  And that release went 30 miles and was caught on incoming filters at a U.S.
[02:24:03.687 --> 02:24:05.548]  Navy nuclear weapons station.
[02:24:06.178 --> 02:24:08.079]  And they had an alarm and thought it was theirs, yeah.
[02:24:08.239 --> 02:24:08.459]  Correct.
[02:24:08.499 --> 02:24:12.121]  They thought it was theirs going out, and what it was was the DU coming in 30 miles.
[02:24:12.762 --> 02:24:15.943]  And now with Busby's work, we know that it goes all the way around the globe.
[02:24:16.524 --> 02:24:19.105]  And we know, absolutely have to understand, the U.S.
[02:24:19.205 --> 02:24:23.267]  Army Common Task Training mandate absolutely requires every U.S.
[02:24:23.348 --> 02:24:31.872]  military personnel to wear full respiratory and skin protection within 50 meters of any single incident until it's all cleaned up.
[02:24:32.352 --> 02:24:34.974]  It also mandates immediate medical care.
[02:24:35.723 --> 02:24:41.928]  And it states very clearly, very, very specifically, that the uranium contamination made food and water unusable.
[02:24:42.648 --> 02:24:45.390]  So now we're just, we're trashing another entire region.
[02:24:46.131 --> 02:24:48.713]  The other thing that's important, and the U.S.
[02:24:48.813 --> 02:25:04.345]  Army regulation 700-48, which General Eric Shinseki made official, says thou shalt follow, absolutely requires prompt and thorough environmental remediation and absolutely requires prompt and effective medical care for all the casualties.
[02:25:05.154 --> 02:25:07.415]  As does the orders issued by the Surgeon General of the U.S.
[02:25:07.455 --> 02:25:10.536]  Army at that time in April of 2004, General Peake.
[02:25:10.776 --> 02:25:19.100]  Can you talk about the photos, because we've got these posted, where it shows, and we know they took delivery of the big weapons, but we know they're using the Sabos in the tank rounds.
[02:25:19.180 --> 02:25:21.421]  I mean, what do we do about this?
[02:25:21.941 --> 02:25:22.681]  Talk about the photos.
[02:25:23.261 --> 02:25:31.885]  Well, the photos, you know, again, we've been getting all the words, and I've been getting inquiries and phone calls from all over the place for over a week now, and then all of a sudden the photos started showing up.
[02:25:32.409 --> 02:25:34.511]  We knew about the GB-20U delivery.
[02:25:34.551 --> 02:25:35.252]  We knew the Army.
[02:25:35.312 --> 02:25:36.574]  That was already a given thing.
[02:25:37.094 --> 02:25:38.936]  And then we were questioning whether or not it was.
[02:25:38.976 --> 02:25:42.040]  Now, we were looking at the damage that's being done in Lebanon.
[02:25:42.320 --> 02:25:43.782]  All the damage indicates DU.
[02:25:44.302 --> 02:25:50.790]  But until we actually got the full photograph of the DU round being loaded by a tank gunner, Israeli tank gunner, we didn't have that.
[02:25:51.310 --> 02:25:52.772]  And that came in here yesterday.
[02:25:53.283 --> 02:25:55.163]  But they're not going up against heavy armor.
[02:25:55.183 --> 02:26:08.806]  I mean, I know it was developed, they said, in the last ditch of the Russians that already nuked us, and they were rolling into Western Europe, and we were fighting, you know, odds of 10 to 1 with limited troops in foxholes, using DU cannons against them in emergency.
[02:26:09.306 --> 02:26:14.627]  But now it's just, oh, we're going to use it in Lebanon against light personnel targets.
[02:26:15.027 --> 02:26:18.907]  First off, let's understand, uranium munitions have been used against all targets.
[02:26:19.468 --> 02:26:21.928]  They're extraordinarily effective against a wooden house.
[02:26:22.702 --> 02:26:23.642]  Or any brick structure.
[02:26:23.662 --> 02:26:31.564]  They're extraordinarily effective against water treatment facilities, sewage sanitation, apartment buildings, hotels.
[02:26:32.164 --> 02:26:33.044]  That's what they did in Iraq.
[02:26:33.064 --> 02:26:36.465]  Because a .50 Cal will bounce off a big water tank, but not a DU-50 Cal.
[02:26:36.925 --> 02:26:40.285]  A DU-50 Cal, one of our DU-50 Cals fired by the U.S.
[02:26:40.325 --> 02:26:47.006]  Marine, took out an Abrams tank over in Iraq a couple years ago, and we had to do the on during Gulf War II, and we did the investigation and verified that.
[02:26:47.687 --> 02:26:50.187]  And the Department of Defense just kind of all downplayed it.
[02:26:50.666 --> 02:26:52.748]  That's why Barrett brags about how well it is.
[02:26:52.788 --> 02:26:57.312]  Go to the Barrett website for his manufacturing plant down there in Tennessee with a .50 cal rifle.
[02:26:57.552 --> 02:26:59.955]  He brags about the D-round effectiveness in his weapon.
[02:27:00.715 --> 02:27:01.656]  I mean, it's just simple.
[02:27:01.716 --> 02:27:04.539]  We have it now in the kinetic energy penetrators.
[02:27:05.179 --> 02:27:06.300]  That is the 20mm, 25mm, 30mm, 105mm, 120mm, 125mm.
[02:27:06.320 --> 02:27:07.502]  We have it in the 7.62 machine gun.
[02:27:07.522 --> 02:27:09.003]  We have it in the .50 cal machine gun.
[02:27:14.963 --> 02:27:20.327]  We have cluster bombs, ATEM and PEDEM, and we have the great, great bunker busters and cruise missiles.
[02:27:20.827 --> 02:27:23.089]  It's in everything, because it's extraordinarily effective.
[02:27:23.810 --> 02:27:25.111]  And it's totally insane.
[02:27:25.671 --> 02:27:26.211]  Completely.
[02:27:26.332 --> 02:27:30.174]  And as you know, Prime Minister Olmert, I contacted him and he is... Stay there, stay there.
[02:27:30.194 --> 02:27:31.235]  Tell us about it when we get back, sir.
[02:27:31.255 --> 02:27:31.776]  We've got a break.
[02:27:32.196 --> 02:27:32.897]  We'll take some calls.
[02:27:35.939 --> 02:27:36.860]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.320 --> 02:27:38.901]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:38.921 --> 02:27:42.524]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:45.831 --> 02:27:53.120]  United States Pharmacopoeia USP sets the standard for most food supplements and are used in over 95% of all vitamin and mineral supplements in the world.
[02:27:53.300 --> 02:27:56.323]  The problem is that these products have never appeared in any living tissue.
[02:27:56.444 --> 02:27:59.808]  They're created in laboratories and are not recognizable to the body's metabolism.
[02:28:00.268 --> 02:28:05.775]  Grown by nature, products are different because they use re-natured ingredients, proprietary blends of essential vitamins and minerals,
[02:28:06.135 --> 02:28:06.575]  I think so.
[02:28:29.804 --> 02:28:32.087]  That's 877-817-9829 because not all products are grown by nature, but they should be.
[02:28:45.538 --> 02:28:47.519]  You've asked for them and now they're here.
[02:28:47.599 --> 02:28:58.303]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use for the Berkey Light's Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[02:28:58.683 --> 02:29:03.205]  The Berkey's PF2s simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Element.
[02:29:03.265 --> 02:29:14.609]  When used, water flow through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[02:29:15.189 --> 02:29:22.031]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[02:29:22.431 --> 02:29:24.571]  Your purified water is now ready.
[02:29:25.071 --> 02:29:30.033]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 host filter elements.
[02:29:30.333 --> 02:29:37.614]  Get a set of two for only $49 or get two sets for only $89 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[02:29:37.674 --> 02:29:38.315]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[02:29:45.818 --> 02:29:48.682]  So Janice, where are you and Jim going on vacation this summer?
[02:29:48.702 --> 02:29:52.768]  Definitely somewhere with a beach, though who knows if our feet will even touch the sand.
[02:29:52.988 --> 02:29:56.733]  That reminds me Janice, have you figured out how to talk to Jim about his problem?
[02:29:56.854 --> 02:29:59.738]  No, I want to, but men can be so sensitive.
[02:29:59.938 --> 02:30:01.260]  Well, it's only going to get worse.
[02:30:01.560 --> 02:30:03.621]  Remember, I was going through the same thing with Dan.
[02:30:03.821 --> 02:30:05.542]  Then I found Mycoside NS.
[02:30:05.762 --> 02:30:06.922]  What's Mycoside NS?
[02:30:07.262 --> 02:30:10.543]  Mycoside NS kills the germs that can cause fungal infections.
[02:30:10.844 --> 02:30:12.044]  It worked great for Dan.
[02:30:12.184 --> 02:30:14.245]  He had the worst looking thick yellow toenails.
[02:30:14.465 --> 02:30:16.206]  Now his nails look clear and healthy.
[02:30:16.306 --> 02:30:17.226]  Do I need a prescription?
[02:30:17.546 --> 02:30:23.250]  No, you can get Mycoside NS antifungal treatment in the food care aisle at any drugstore or major retailer.
[02:30:23.370 --> 02:30:24.451]  And it really worked?
[02:30:24.631 --> 02:30:26.113]  Yep, it worked on me, too.
[02:30:26.273 --> 02:30:28.354]  I had some white discolorations on my toe.
[02:30:28.474 --> 02:30:30.496]  I just applied Mycoside NS daily.
[02:30:30.636 --> 02:30:32.437]  I didn't even have to remove my nail polish.
[02:30:32.698 --> 02:30:33.398]  Sounds easy.
[02:30:33.538 --> 02:30:35.380]  I can start planning our beach getaway.
[02:30:35.580 --> 02:30:39.823]  Yeah, Mycoside definitely gave us the confidence to bare our feet again.
[02:30:40.063 --> 02:30:43.025]  Pick up Mycoside NS at drugstores and major retailers.
[02:30:43.125 --> 02:30:44.967]  Look for a free bonus gift in each box.
[02:30:58.357 --> 02:31:00.878]  We'll go right back to Dr. Doug Roffey here in just a moment.
[02:31:00.998 --> 02:31:01.819]  We'll take your calls.
[02:31:04.080 --> 02:31:04.580]  Think about it.
[02:31:04.940 --> 02:31:16.285]  He has taught undergraduate, graduate courses in environmental science, environmental engineering, nuclear physics, emergency management, and was a staff physicist at UIUC for 19 years.
[02:31:16.785 --> 02:31:19.146]  He was the head of the Army's Blue Uranium Project.
[02:31:21.610 --> 02:31:27.471]  He'll be joining us, come up in a minute or two, to get more into the DU crisis and how crazy it is, and take your calls.
[02:31:27.951 --> 02:31:34.853]  But before we do that, my new film, Terror Storm, is out, and I cannot, with words, describe how good it is.
[02:31:34.893 --> 02:31:37.073]  You've heard the callers who are now getting their DVDs.
[02:31:37.473 --> 02:31:39.994]  The callers who've seen it online at prisonplanet.tv.
[02:31:40.274 --> 02:31:42.194]  They're going, man, this is better than your other films.
[02:31:42.234 --> 02:31:43.594]  And listen, Martial Law is excellent.
[02:31:44.114 --> 02:31:45.615]  Order of Death, wonderful film.
[02:31:45.715 --> 02:31:47.235]  All my videos are super good.
[02:31:48.030 --> 02:31:57.776]  Terror Storm is just unbelievable, and it's really effective on people that have never investigated, who aren't informed, because it has all the documents, the video, the information.
[02:31:58.276 --> 02:32:00.738]  It chronicles the attack on the USS Liberty that was staged.
[02:32:00.758 --> 02:32:01.858]  You get us in a war with Egypt.
[02:32:02.639 --> 02:32:03.579]  It goes through Hitler.
[02:32:04.160 --> 02:32:07.081]  It goes through a bunch of historical examples of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:32:07.502 --> 02:32:11.744]  Then 9-11, the Iraq War, the 7-7 bombings, the Madrid bombing.
[02:32:12.224 --> 02:32:13.885]  All government inside jobs.
[02:32:14.045 --> 02:32:14.806]  Totally proven.
[02:32:15.450 --> 02:32:20.716]  We've got Ray McGovern, top CIA analyst, and members of British Parliament, member of Blair's cabinet going public.
[02:32:21.256 --> 02:32:28.363]  We have a nuclear physicist going public about how they blew up the towers using shape charges and thermite.
[02:32:29.304 --> 02:32:30.706]  It just goes on and on.
[02:32:31.707 --> 02:32:34.470]  We've got the number one economist from Bush's last administration.
[02:32:35.254 --> 02:32:36.195]  Dr. Morgan Reynolds.
[02:32:36.295 --> 02:32:37.236]  It's all in there.
[02:32:37.296 --> 02:32:39.638]  Charlie Sheen going public in that firestorm.
[02:32:40.219 --> 02:32:41.460]  It is an amazing film.
[02:32:41.760 --> 02:32:47.406]  It's 1995 to get the American Scholar Symposium version I've been putting out for three weeks.
[02:32:47.706 --> 02:32:49.268]  The official one comes out in about two.
[02:32:50.436 --> 02:32:51.577]  But we cannot wait.
[02:32:51.657 --> 02:32:52.737]  You cannot wait to get it.
[02:32:52.757 --> 02:32:57.419]  The big official one will have about an hour of extras from the 9-11 Symposium, and it's excellent.
[02:32:57.739 --> 02:33:02.261]  But please get this American Scholar Symposium Edition, this collector's item.
[02:33:02.281 --> 02:33:03.181]  I'm signing each one.
[02:33:03.562 --> 02:33:05.522]  And then get the big official one when it comes out, too.
[02:33:05.843 --> 02:33:11.285]  We could not wait a month while we were finishing the extras and making the DVD before we put this out.
[02:33:12.654 --> 02:33:13.756]  And so now we put it out.
[02:33:13.896 --> 02:33:20.745]  Please go to Infowars.com, get it, and then get the official one when it comes out and see that as your support for this broadcast.
[02:33:21.568 --> 02:33:22.649]  And get the order of death.
[02:33:22.709 --> 02:33:23.469]  Get martial law.
[02:33:23.489 --> 02:33:24.769]  Get my other videos while you're at it.
[02:33:24.830 --> 02:33:36.074]  So again, InfoWars.com to order via the safe, secure online video and book shopping cart or call toll free 1-888-253-3139 to order.
[02:33:36.514 --> 02:33:37.975]  They can answer all your questions when you call.
[02:33:37.995 --> 02:33:39.836]  Tell you about different discounts and specials we have.
[02:33:40.116 --> 02:33:44.578]  In some cases as low as $5.95 per film I produce when you get multiple copies.
[02:33:46.883 --> 02:33:52.767]  We also have deals where you can call this office and get bulk discounts if you want to distribute and get it out there to people.
[02:33:53.408 --> 02:33:55.509]  And that number is 512-291-5750, 512-291-5750 for orders of more than 20 or more.
[02:33:55.529 --> 02:33:59.712]  Again, that's 1-888-253-3139 for the general order line or 512-291-5750 or see it all online right now at prisonplanet.tv.
[02:34:14.682 --> 02:34:16.344]  Going back to Dr. Rocky.
[02:34:16.704 --> 02:34:20.008]  Doctor, I want to talk about psychology here for a moment.
[02:34:21.255 --> 02:34:31.001]  The Army's own documents, the development of the weapons, they know it's deadly, they know it's toxic, they know it's radioactive, they know it just radically expands birth defects.
[02:34:31.601 --> 02:34:36.183]  Now, because it gets into the ovaries, it gets into the testicles, and it just totally thrives DNA.
[02:34:36.704 --> 02:34:39.605]  We know that, I mean, this is ancient science.
[02:34:39.645 --> 02:34:47.490]  This is peer-reviewed, official policy, officially admitted, but now they're using it, as you said, even down into small arms.
[02:34:48.110 --> 02:34:48.771]  We're good to go.
[02:34:48.791 --> 02:34:49.071]  I think?
[02:35:06.466 --> 02:35:13.192]  Well, the people in the military, first off, you have to understand, and I've been a warrior forever, you're John Wayne, you're Rambo, you're thoroughly immune to everything.
[02:35:13.212 --> 02:35:15.474]  You will not get sick, you will not get injured, you will not die.
[02:35:31.092 --> 02:35:34.134]  Well, so will a nuclear bomb, but we don't use them because of the blowback.
[02:35:48.567 --> 02:35:51.728]  Yeah, well, we're the only country that has, and we will again.
[02:35:51.768 --> 02:35:57.091]  We're doing the research right now as we speak on the mini-nukes, and it's already been stated we will use them.
[02:35:57.291 --> 02:35:58.951]  No such thing as mini either, is there?
[02:35:59.231 --> 02:35:59.812]  No, there isn't.
[02:35:59.852 --> 02:36:00.792]  There is no such thing.
[02:36:01.392 --> 02:36:14.278]  And war, no matter what you do, and one of the questions that came today, and I've been having inquiries coming from all kinds of press and family members, the Lebanese are having extraordinarily health problems because of this combat engagement.
[02:36:14.698 --> 02:36:17.339]  So what we've done is they're using uranium munitions.
[02:36:17.938 --> 02:36:25.459]  They're destroying the infrastructure, releasing all the toxic industrial chemicals from agricultural, industry, medicine, and education all over the area.
[02:36:26.019 --> 02:36:27.440]  And people are getting sick and dying.
[02:36:27.480 --> 02:36:30.740]  Just what happened in the Gulf War and the Balkans and all over the place.
[02:36:31.260 --> 02:36:32.721]  And what actually happened in Katrina.
[02:36:32.741 --> 02:36:34.601]  You know, when all that stuff got destroyed.
[02:36:35.221 --> 02:36:37.882]  So we're seeing the same thing over and over again.
[02:36:38.402 --> 02:36:45.523]  The other thing that I have thorough confirmation of, I've been hearing words and rumors about the Lebanese coming down with massive diarrhea and vomiting.
[02:36:46.377 --> 02:36:56.319]  Well, then, at the end of last week, I found out from the Pentagon, a source that I thoroughly trust, said, oh, yeah, they're using biologicals, Bacillus colbagi, and I go, oh, great, thank you very much.
[02:36:56.339 --> 02:37:02.401]  Have you seen the photos in mainstream news of huge bio-slash-chemical canisters?
[02:37:02.421 --> 02:37:07.202]  We don't know what's in them, but it is for heavy artillery to deliver that, and that it's exploding?
[02:37:07.702 --> 02:37:12.943]  Bacillus colbagi, probably, because from the health effects for where they've been used, that's what it comes out like.
[02:37:13.343 --> 02:37:13.643]  The U.S.
[02:37:13.663 --> 02:37:21.067]  military had used Baxillus Goldbergi down at Fort McClellan back in the 90s, causing a catastrophe, you know, just all kinds of health problems in the whole region.
[02:37:21.547 --> 02:37:25.449]  And then the reporters that reported on it actually got it back and they transmitted it back home.
[02:37:25.989 --> 02:37:28.250]  See, that's the other thing that happens with uranium remissions.
[02:37:28.811 --> 02:37:38.495]  The reason why you have to wear respiratory skin protection and go through decontamination, which is mandated in the common task in the Army regulations, is that you don't want to transfer it back home.
[02:37:38.876 --> 02:37:41.717]  You don't want to take the equipment and contaminate and transfer it back home.
[02:37:42.798 --> 02:37:53.789]  That came about because 1994-95, when I went back on as a director of the Depleted Uranium Project, we found contaminated equipment from Gulf War I at Fort McClellan and Anniston Army Depot.
[02:37:54.249 --> 02:37:58.453]  Four years and five years after the fact, it had been brought back to the States.
[02:37:58.633 --> 02:38:06.321]  Well, going back to proving grounds, they're serving it out into old munitions now, and I've read they're using it at every major base, and this is insane!
[02:38:07.043 --> 02:38:11.364]  It's thoroughly insane, but you have to understand, again, what it is, is that we're going to kill and destroy.
[02:38:11.404 --> 02:38:16.305]  We've thoroughly forgot what ethics and morality exist.
[02:38:16.765 --> 02:38:19.626]  We have thoroughly forgot what the adverse health effects of war are.
[02:38:20.126 --> 02:38:21.987]  I mean, let's look at the real numbers.
[02:38:22.687 --> 02:38:24.047]  And we've talked about this before.
[02:38:24.507 --> 02:38:24.847]  The U.S.
[02:38:24.867 --> 02:38:29.488]  Department of Veteran Affairs puts out what's called a Compensation of Pension Statistics every few months.
[02:38:30.068 --> 02:38:32.389]  This is under the Gulf War Veterans Information System.
[02:38:32.849 --> 02:38:34.029]  The May 2006 report that I received
[02:38:37.119 --> 02:38:55.849]  Thoroughly documents that as of May 30, 2006, 383,913 of America's sons and daughters had applied for permanent disability and permanent medical care for injuries and illnesses incurred in the Persian Gulf from August of 1990 through May 30, 2006. 383,000!
[02:39:03.121 --> 02:39:05.942]  So what percentage of the general force is that from that war?
[02:39:06.442 --> 02:39:08.343]  Well, let's come back on down.
[02:39:09.243 --> 02:39:12.044]  We know that the number of people that were deployed as of May 30th were 1,129,340.
[02:39:12.084 --> 02:39:12.164]  Okay?
[02:39:12.184 --> 02:39:13.065]  A little over 1 million.
[02:39:13.085 --> 02:39:17.406]  But as of May 30th, out of the 1 million that had been deployed, there were only 943,000 left alive.
[02:39:17.426 --> 02:39:17.606]  Wow.
[02:39:17.626 --> 02:39:22.028]  You know, so 180,000 of the sons and daughters that got deployed in the Persian Gulf have died.
[02:39:33.075 --> 02:39:36.859]  Between, you know, they'd get employed in the Persian Gulf from August of 1990 up until May of 2006.
[02:39:37.099 --> 02:39:44.886]  If you compare that to their average year group, I would imagine that it's a much higher death rate than what we'd see in the general population.
[02:39:45.146 --> 02:39:50.571]  Oh, it's incredible, because you've got to remember, we were all extremely healthy, could run all day and leap tall buildings at a single bound.
[02:39:51.192 --> 02:39:54.795]  This is an extraordinarily healthy population for that prior time of deployment.
[02:39:55.856 --> 02:39:57.798]  And so they're coming back sick all over the place.
[02:39:58.314 --> 02:40:02.957]  I mean, when we go back to the numbers for Gulf War I alone, okay, what, 100-hour war, correct?
[02:40:03.597 --> 02:40:03.878]  Yes.
[02:40:04.118 --> 02:40:04.838]  Something like that.
[02:40:05.599 --> 02:40:14.865]  As of May 30, 2006, 265,433 applied for permanent disability medical care for life.
[02:40:15.285 --> 02:40:16.686]  But I'm getting back to the mentality.
[02:40:16.706 --> 02:40:21.689]  I understand for the troops and the generals that, you know, we're tough, we're bulletproof, we can do whatever we want.
[02:40:22.558 --> 02:40:23.359]  We're good to go.
[02:40:47.794 --> 02:41:07.168]  Well, in March of 1991, General Franks and General Brown-Hannamy, a memorandum called the Los Alamos Memorandum, and that directed us to lie in our official reports regarding the adverse health and environmental effects of uranium emissions in order to maintain proponents who sustained their use so they would not become politically unacceptable and be deleted from the arsenals.
[02:41:07.768 --> 02:41:09.449]  That was the first directive I got.
[02:41:09.949 --> 02:41:13.492]  We all started getting sick within 24 to 48 hours, and it's never ceased.
[02:41:14.407 --> 02:41:16.909]  I ordered medical care immediately for all DU casualties.
[02:41:16.949 --> 02:41:18.190]  That has never happened.
[02:41:18.710 --> 02:41:19.811]  It has not happened.
[02:41:20.552 --> 02:41:21.712]  And that happened in Iraq.
[02:41:21.852 --> 02:41:24.634]  And then as you're aware, you got a copy of the response.
[02:41:24.714 --> 02:41:30.338]  I contacted Prime Minister Olmert and President Bush again this week, in the last few days.
[02:41:30.859 --> 02:41:35.782]  And I also personally called up in the Secretary of Defense office and said, okay, guys, you're using it again.
[02:41:35.822 --> 02:41:37.703]  You better clean it up and give the medical care.
[02:41:38.564 --> 02:41:40.766]  Well, you know, thank you very much and go away.
[02:41:42.086 --> 02:41:42.707]  What has happened?
[02:41:43.689 --> 02:41:48.774]  As a warrior, as a patriot, I had to come to the realization that we had saw in Vietnam with Agent Orange.
[02:41:49.374 --> 02:41:54.299]  And you have to understand, DU is the Agent Orange of the new century, the new generation.
[02:41:55.020 --> 02:42:00.565]  I had to come to the realization that, number one, when we are ordered to go to the military, we're not going to have the equipment necessary.
[02:42:01.205 --> 02:42:06.670]  We're not going to have the mandated and developed education and training which maintains combat readiness.
[02:42:07.251 --> 02:42:09.513]  When you get injured, you're not going to get the medical care.
[02:42:10.262 --> 02:42:15.985]  And when you die, you're going to be thoroughly abandoned, like Sergeant First Class John Sitt and one of my team members was.
[02:42:16.866 --> 02:42:19.047]  Just totally abandoned and died of lung cancer.
[02:42:19.967 --> 02:42:29.893]  And despite specific requests for medical care all the way up to the President of the United States, Billy Clinton, he never got it and he died abandoned in Springfield Memorial Hospital, Springfield, Illinois.
[02:42:31.154 --> 02:42:34.896]  Well, every time we talk about this and we take a lot of calls, when we have time to,
[02:42:35.683 --> 02:42:38.324]  I don't know if it'll happen today because we don't have a lot of time for calls, but we'll take some.
[02:42:38.504 --> 02:42:44.966]  People call in whose sons and daughters have come back totally healthy, 25, 30 years old, 18, 19 years old.
[02:42:45.346 --> 02:42:46.626]  They've been in bunkers that were hit.
[02:42:46.646 --> 02:42:47.786]  They've been in areas that were hit.
[02:42:48.306 --> 02:42:50.327]  And, man, they will just fall apart.
[02:42:50.407 --> 02:42:53.088]  They will go into convulsions.
[02:42:53.108 --> 02:42:54.068]  They'll get cancers.
[02:42:54.108 --> 02:42:55.148]  Their kids are deformed.
[02:42:55.208 --> 02:43:00.470]  I mean, it is just so horrible to see this, and that's how we support the troops?
[02:43:00.930 --> 02:43:01.810]  Well, that's what happened.
[02:43:01.830 --> 02:43:04.891]  Let's look at the case, the 442nd Military Police Unit.
[02:43:05.379 --> 02:43:12.042]  New York National Guard that responded to the World Trade Center, okay, in those incidents, they got activated and deployed to Iraq.
[02:43:13.022 --> 02:43:13.882]  They got exposed.
[02:43:14.763 --> 02:43:31.129]  Those warriors, those American warriors, those heroes, the finest of New York's finest, conceived children now born with birth defects, have developed cancer, have all kinds of medical problems, and those heroes of America, New York's finest, have been totally abandoned.
[02:43:31.670 --> 02:43:32.990]  By the Department of Defense and U.S.
[02:43:33.010 --> 02:43:34.071]  Department of Veterans Affairs.
[02:43:34.491 --> 02:43:36.712]  Not only them, but myself.
[02:43:36.852 --> 02:43:40.953]  My health took a turn for the worse here on the bone decalcification a little over a week ago.
[02:43:41.833 --> 02:43:45.234]  And after the test, my doctor's nurse called and said, Doug, we've got to do something right now.
[02:43:45.974 --> 02:43:48.435]  So I called Dr. Melissa McDermott at the Baltimore VA.
[02:43:48.475 --> 02:43:53.577]  That is the doctor responsible for the DU medical program and asked her to call back and help me.
[02:43:54.736 --> 02:43:59.381]  Al, they've never called me or had me back up there since March of 1999 after they saw all the problems.
[02:43:59.621 --> 02:44:06.548]  Because even though you wrote the book on it and were over there running the program, now you're calling her, the former head of the program, and you're not going to get a call back.
[02:44:07.128 --> 02:44:09.251]  I never will, and my guys can't get medical care.
[02:44:09.431 --> 02:44:11.493]  I've had individuals that have requested medical care.
[02:44:11.533 --> 02:44:12.494]  They've never received it.
[02:44:13.138 --> 02:44:16.321]  And, you know, the United States General Accounting Office thoroughly confirmed that.
[02:44:16.781 --> 02:44:20.845]  The President of the United States knows how many needed it, and they just totally disregarded it.
[02:44:20.865 --> 02:44:33.295]  Does it make you angry because, I mean, not just for yourself and your colleagues, but it's going to just keep happening and happening and happening, and it's going to be toxified in our neighborhoods, and they just don't care.
[02:44:33.335 --> 02:44:34.616]  It's crazy.
[02:44:35.377 --> 02:44:37.599]  God's backyard is now being contaminated.
[02:44:38.743 --> 02:44:42.786]  And the women and children of God's backyard are going to be affected for eternity.
[02:44:42.986 --> 02:44:44.827]  But it doesn't end there, Dr. Rocky, as you know.
[02:44:44.847 --> 02:44:49.330]  I mean, I have newscasts where the federal government says mercury is good for your brain now.
[02:44:49.910 --> 02:44:52.092]  I mean, they're not just doing it on this.
[02:44:52.332 --> 02:44:58.776]  It's like a general craziness has begun, where because the government says mercury is good for your child's brain.
[02:44:58.996 --> 02:44:59.937]  In fact, find that clip.
[02:44:59.957 --> 02:45:01.137]  You won't believe me unless I play it.
[02:45:01.558 --> 02:45:04.079]  This aired nationally, but it aired in local towns, too.
[02:45:04.099 --> 02:45:04.800]  I have it from Austin.
[02:45:05.480 --> 02:45:07.241]  I'm talking to the psychology.
[02:45:07.301 --> 02:45:11.842]  Where do you see this going if it's now been delivered for small arms?
[02:45:12.342 --> 02:45:13.002]  Where's it going?
[02:45:13.762 --> 02:45:15.963]  It's going just as catastrophic.
[02:45:16.063 --> 02:45:16.943]  I mean, I don't know.
[02:45:17.063 --> 02:45:18.084]  It's a whole turning point.
[02:45:18.124 --> 02:45:20.984]  We have to understand, and this was a realization I had to come through.
[02:45:21.605 --> 02:45:30.127]  And as a warrior, a dedicated warrior, a disabled combat veteran, and now retired senior army officer, I had to come to the realization, number one, nobody ever wins in war.
[02:45:31.311 --> 02:45:31.711]  We're good to go.
[02:45:47.679 --> 02:45:54.626]  We had our Secretary of State going over and said, well, we want peace, but yet we're delivering horrible weapons and authorizing their use at the same time.
[02:45:54.706 --> 02:46:06.337]  Well, getting back to how they could use DU, I'm sure you heard about how Bayer's been found guilty simply, and they got their own documents where they knowingly, for over 10 years after they found it, putting HIV and hepatitis C in the factor VIII, doctor.
[02:46:06.357 --> 02:46:10.301]  I mean, and in their own corporate documents, say, we're going to make money anyways, just sell it.
[02:46:11.678 --> 02:46:12.899]  I mean, it's just, it's incredible.
[02:46:12.919 --> 02:46:13.659]  Let's take a call.
[02:46:14.260 --> 02:46:14.740]  Watson.
[02:46:14.760 --> 02:46:17.082]  He wants to be known as Watson in Illinois.
[02:46:17.102 --> 02:46:17.762]  You're on the air.
[02:46:17.822 --> 02:46:18.282]  Go ahead.
[02:46:19.363 --> 02:46:19.963]  Hello, Alex.
[02:46:20.044 --> 02:46:20.624]  How are you, sir?
[02:46:20.824 --> 02:46:21.024]  Fine.
[02:46:21.044 --> 02:46:21.344]  Go ahead.
[02:46:22.565 --> 02:46:27.548]  Well, I first want to say happy anniversary to you.
[02:46:27.769 --> 02:46:29.610]  Five years from when you predicted September 11th.
[02:46:29.830 --> 02:46:30.170]  Oh, yes.
[02:46:30.731 --> 02:46:31.671]  Well, that was yesterday.
[02:46:31.731 --> 02:46:31.991]  Yes, sir.
[02:46:32.011 --> 02:46:32.272]  Thank you.
[02:46:32.972 --> 02:46:33.492]  Okay.
[02:46:33.672 --> 02:46:36.114]  The other thing is I saw Skinner Darkly this weekend.
[02:46:36.734 --> 02:46:37.835]  You know, incredible movie.
[02:46:38.636 --> 02:46:40.477]  I also, you were talking recently about
[02:46:40.911 --> 02:46:42.572]  Oliver Stone in World Trade Center.
[02:46:42.592 --> 02:46:45.415]  You know, is this going to be a propaganda film?
[02:46:46.296 --> 02:46:58.306]  Well, I have a, he's in the latest article, the latest issue of GQ, and he is calling Bush, he has no compassion in his damn, departmental language, damn soul, and he wouldn't be such a liar.
[02:46:58.766 --> 02:47:04.371]  So he is accusing George Bush of being a liar, so obviously he probably knows a lot of the truth behind it.
[02:47:04.391 --> 02:47:05.432]  Oh, I know who this is now.
[02:47:05.452 --> 02:47:06.973]  I met you guys in Chicago.
[02:47:07.033 --> 02:47:08.034]  This is Mr. Watson.
[02:47:08.564 --> 02:47:09.325]  Correct, correct.
[02:47:09.525 --> 02:47:10.125]  How are you doing?
[02:47:10.325 --> 02:47:11.486]  I'm doing great.
[02:47:11.806 --> 02:47:13.567]  Oliver Stone did a great job with JFK.
[02:47:13.828 --> 02:47:16.329]  He's allowed to make a movie about the firefighters who were heroes.
[02:47:16.650 --> 02:47:18.671]  Whatever happened on 9-11 doesn't take away from it.
[02:47:18.871 --> 02:47:20.972]  In fact, Dr. Rocky, let me just bring this up to you right now.
[02:47:21.653 --> 02:47:24.775]  I mean, do you believe the official 9-11 story hunts?
[02:47:24.835 --> 02:47:33.401]  Do you believe that 19 guys out of a cave could make NORAD stand down and fly planes into buildings and then do CIA insider trading and all the rest of it?
[02:47:34.139 --> 02:47:34.800]  No, I do not.
[02:47:35.000 --> 02:47:42.009]  I mean, I'm the Army officer that trained the New York Emergency Services Unit on counterterrorism, WMD, and improvised explosive devices.
[02:47:42.450 --> 02:47:44.492]  I put that program together and they were my first class.
[02:47:44.973 --> 02:47:47.997]  They have stated very specifically in radio transmissions now released
[02:47:48.576 --> 02:47:53.800]  And in videos, there were explosives going off floor by floor in the World Trade Center as it came down.
[02:47:54.361 --> 02:47:56.222]  They stated that very specifically.
[02:47:56.242 --> 02:47:58.484]  Who has the motive, Doctor, for carrying out 9-11?
[02:47:58.884 --> 02:48:00.245]  Well, it's very simple.
[02:48:00.265 --> 02:48:12.574]  The United States had to obtain specific public approval for the invasions of Afghanistan and Gulf War II in Iraq, and both of those were planned years and years before on 9-11 or September.
[02:48:12.594 --> 02:48:14.476]  They were supposed to actually be fully implemented,
[02:48:15.618 --> 02:48:24.466]  In 2000, while Clinton was president, General Franks thoroughly acknowledged that on page 336 of the actual 9-1-1 Commission Report.
[02:48:25.087 --> 02:48:28.571]  Do you think the evidence leans towards an inside job?
[02:48:28.991 --> 02:48:29.351]  Yes, sir.
[02:48:31.634 --> 02:48:32.555]  Alright, incredible.
[02:48:32.595 --> 02:48:33.716]  Mr. Watson, anything else?
[02:48:34.859 --> 02:48:37.140]  Well, yes, if you would let me stay on.
[02:48:37.180 --> 02:48:37.900]  Stay there real quick.
[02:48:37.920 --> 02:48:39.080]  We're already in the final segment.
[02:48:39.320 --> 02:48:40.800]  I'll try to jam a few more calls in, too.
[02:48:41.180 --> 02:48:42.481]  This is an incredible interview.
[02:48:42.841 --> 02:48:44.061]  Thank you, Dr. Rocky, for joining us.
[02:48:44.181 --> 02:48:44.761]  One more segment.
[02:48:44.781 --> 02:48:45.161]  Stay there.
[02:48:48.942 --> 02:48:52.123]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[02:48:52.463 --> 02:48:54.363]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[02:48:54.763 --> 02:49:02.405]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:49:03.123 --> 02:49:10.166]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:49:10.567 --> 02:49:21.992]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:49:22.292 --> 02:49:25.814]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:49:26.254 --> 02:49:28.195]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:49:28.535 --> 02:49:32.297]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:49:45.820 --> 02:49:49.701]  Black Berkey replacement elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[02:49:49.942 --> 02:49:55.384]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[02:49:55.664 --> 02:50:06.007]  Ideal for travel or outdoor events and perfect in the event of hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies because they remove both harmful chemicals and pathogenic bacteria from water.
[02:50:06.187 --> 02:50:10.509]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:50:10.709 --> 02:50:19.050]  Trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and NTBE are removed to below detectable limits.
[02:50:19.350 --> 02:50:25.712]  They reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, aluminum, copper, and foul taste like chlorine and sulfur odors.
[02:50:25.832 --> 02:50:30.292]  Yet the Black Berkey filter elements leave in the helpful and beneficial minerals that your body needs.
[02:50:30.512 --> 02:50:34.733]  Normally $48 each, get a two-pack for only $91 or a four-pack for only $173.
[02:50:35.093 --> 02:50:39.394]  Get the powerful Black Berkey replacement filters now by calling New Millennium at 888-
[02:50:40.094 --> 02:50:40.655]  We're good to go.
[02:50:40.675 --> 02:50:40.955]  I think?
[02:51:02.435 --> 02:51:03.095]  We're good to go.
[02:51:31.969 --> 02:51:35.071]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[02:51:35.231 --> 02:51:41.094]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[02:52:10.716 --> 02:52:12.137]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:52:12.717 --> 02:52:13.737]  Thank you for joining us.
[02:52:16.018 --> 02:52:22.101]  Dr. Rocky, would you like to make any other statements or comments about September 11th?
[02:52:22.201 --> 02:52:24.542]  As more and more people go public about it being an inside job.
[02:52:24.562 --> 02:52:27.583]  You just said it all there, but any other key points you'd like to add?
[02:52:28.144 --> 02:52:28.604]  Not really.
[02:52:28.644 --> 02:52:29.504]  I think it's pretty clear.
[02:52:29.544 --> 02:52:31.105]  I think right now what we must do
[02:52:32.540 --> 02:52:44.568]  The United States Department of Defense, now the British Ministry of Defense, and now Israelis, are using illegal weapons against civilians and everybody else in the military, and they must clean it up as required by their own directives.
[02:52:44.588 --> 02:52:45.909]  They must provide medical care.
[02:52:46.869 --> 02:52:48.630]  I have contacted Prime Minister Olmert.
[02:52:48.670 --> 02:52:50.051]  You have the response from him.
[02:52:50.091 --> 02:52:51.512]  I think it's been posted on your website.
[02:52:52.453 --> 02:52:53.253]  So they know the warnings.
[02:52:53.333 --> 02:52:56.715]  I've contacted the President of the United States, members of the Department of Defense.
[02:52:57.256 --> 02:52:59.357]  I was told by a senior leader in the Pentagon that,
[02:52:59.915 --> 02:53:01.276]  That they all know what the problems are.
[02:53:01.316 --> 02:53:02.117]  They just don't care.
[02:53:02.697 --> 02:53:04.459]  There is no accountability anymore.
[02:53:04.519 --> 02:53:08.422]  The American public and the citizens of the world must take accountability.
[02:53:08.523 --> 02:53:09.904]  Well, I agree, Dr. Rocky.
[02:53:10.004 --> 02:53:19.072]  And if Bayer will knowingly kill hundreds of thousands with HIV and they'll knowingly spread DU everywhere, I mean, that fits into them killing 2,800 plus people on 9-11.
[02:53:19.392 --> 02:53:19.812]  Do you agree?
[02:53:20.253 --> 02:53:21.374]  Yeah, I think it comes together.
[02:53:21.434 --> 02:53:23.796]  What's happened as a scientist and a university type
[02:53:24.298 --> 02:53:27.880]  You know, a military officer, scientists and engineers never forgot about one thing.
[02:53:27.940 --> 02:53:34.565]  Yeah, technology might be there, but that doesn't mean we use technology without considering the long-term health and environmental consequences.
[02:53:34.685 --> 02:53:38.608]  I saw a San Francisco Chronicle report where they were talking to an Air Force general at a press conference.
[02:53:38.628 --> 02:53:46.993]  He admitted they're developing antimatter bombs, and they admitted that top scientists, physicists are telling them that it could destroy the whole planet, but they're going to go ahead and test it.
[02:53:47.894 --> 02:53:48.394]  They don't care.
[02:53:48.594 --> 02:53:52.417]  It's like if you can get a dollar, we're going to do it, and if you want to sustain your job, you'll do it.
[02:53:52.927 --> 02:53:54.529]  I made my conscious decision.
[02:53:55.249 --> 02:53:59.513]  Would I go along with the nonsense or would I speak out and do what was right for God and the citizens of the world?
[02:54:00.034 --> 02:54:03.557]  Myself and a whole bunch of us are doing what's right because this is flat wrong.
[02:54:04.358 --> 02:54:08.182]  And we must obtain total accountability again and stop the nonsense.
[02:54:08.755 --> 02:54:10.196]  Before everybody goes under.
[02:54:10.436 --> 02:54:12.998]  They're totally contaminated in God's backyard.
[02:54:13.438 --> 02:54:15.399]  That is absolutely unacceptable.
[02:54:15.599 --> 02:54:16.380]  I agree with you.
[02:54:16.580 --> 02:54:17.480]  Mr. Watson, finish up.
[02:54:17.500 --> 02:54:19.381]  Let me get one more caller in here.
[02:54:19.502 --> 02:54:19.942]  Go ahead.
[02:54:20.442 --> 02:54:21.042]  Okay, okay.
[02:54:21.102 --> 02:54:23.944]  Here's what I'm putting out a challenge to all the listeners.
[02:54:24.404 --> 02:54:26.406]  Okay, because you have done the work, Alex.
[02:54:26.746 --> 02:54:29.908]  All the scientists, all the professors, they have done the research.
[02:54:30.308 --> 02:54:31.669]  The whistleblowers are coming out.
[02:54:32.353 --> 02:54:39.435]  I challenge not just the listeners, but also the people in Hollywood to donate to your cause, to put this out mainstream.
[02:54:40.055 --> 02:54:44.196]  I am contributing $1,115 to your campaign.
[02:54:44.676 --> 02:54:46.516]  Okay, that on November 15th.
[02:54:46.556 --> 02:54:47.856]  Hold on, my campaign what?
[02:54:48.156 --> 02:54:48.937]  What campaign?
[02:54:48.957 --> 02:54:50.697]  Just to get the information out there.
[02:54:50.717 --> 02:54:51.637]  Buy more bandwidth.
[02:54:51.957 --> 02:54:52.617]  Print more DVDs.
[02:54:52.657 --> 02:54:55.478]  Well, you're awesome, but listen, I would just ask you to do this.
[02:54:55.518 --> 02:55:00.779]  I would just ask you to buy a bunch of Terror Storms and then burn copies of those and give them to people.
[02:55:01.832 --> 02:55:08.575]  The most effective thing is for you at the ground level, and that's wonderful, but you notice I'm not like everybody else who asks for contributions.
[02:55:08.915 --> 02:55:10.536]  Contribute by buying a bunch of videos.
[02:55:10.556 --> 02:55:12.236]  We do need your support.
[02:55:12.356 --> 02:55:14.097]  Buy 100 videos from me today, bro.
[02:55:14.357 --> 02:55:15.378]  That's how you can support me.
[02:55:15.978 --> 02:55:16.998]  I will buy 100 videos.
[02:55:17.058 --> 02:55:18.699]  I challenge other people to do the same.
[02:55:20.285 --> 02:55:23.607]  Okay, well, thank you so much for that support.
[02:55:23.647 --> 02:55:25.268]  I met you and your brother and his girlfriend.
[02:55:25.308 --> 02:55:26.789]  You're really great guys, and God bless you.
[02:55:27.129 --> 02:55:27.509]  Take care.
[02:55:27.549 --> 02:55:30.231]  Really nice folks up there in Chicago.
[02:55:30.271 --> 02:55:32.833]  Dr. Rocky, I don't even know if I have time to go to calls now.
[02:55:32.873 --> 02:55:36.635]  I mean, here in closing, I just want to thank you for your courage and all you've done.
[02:55:37.195 --> 02:55:43.599]  And I think we can come through this together, but we've got people that will use DU and carry out 9-11 running our government.
[02:55:43.899 --> 02:55:45.000]  What do you think they'll do next?
[02:55:46.301 --> 02:55:48.122]  God only knows, and we must pray.
[02:55:49.338 --> 02:55:51.879]  We pray that we survive and that we stop the nonsense.
[02:55:53.780 --> 02:55:56.861]  Well, we see elites throughout history kind of go crazy on a power trip.
[02:55:56.881 --> 02:55:57.721]  Do you think that's happened?
[02:55:58.081 --> 02:55:58.721]  Yes, sir, I do.
[02:56:00.462 --> 02:56:04.483]  All right, well, we've got all the links up to the great articles and documents you've been putting out in your letter to Olmert.
[02:56:04.883 --> 02:56:09.865]  We'll do a report on this, sir, and Godspeed, and thank you for coming on on short notice, Doctor.
[02:56:11.046 --> 02:56:16.307]  Thank you, sir, and God bless America, because if we don't follow God, we're all bound to die.
[02:56:16.988 --> 02:56:17.848]  Yes, sir, thank you.
[02:56:18.644 --> 02:56:19.005]  Wow.
[02:56:19.245 --> 02:56:19.825]  Oh, man.
[02:56:21.167 --> 02:56:21.928]  Oh, it's unbelievable.
[02:56:21.988 --> 02:56:22.849]  God bless you all.
