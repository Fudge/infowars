[00:00:05.624 --> 00:00:06.264]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.944 --> 00:00:07.985]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.705 --> 00:00:09.826]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.466 --> 00:00:11.286]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.027 --> 00:00:13.007]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.607 --> 00:00:17.509]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.871]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:39.578]  You're going to be glad if you wish to be informed that you tuned in today because I'm going to run the gamut on a host of vitally central issues.
[00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:46.985]  More is happening in a week these days that would happen previously in several years.
[00:00:48.466 --> 00:00:56.433]  So much is happening right now that is centrally, vitally important to the future of this planet
[00:00:57.208 --> 00:01:04.982]  We are all blessed and, frankly, honored to be alive during this time of tumultuous tribulation.
[00:01:06.463 --> 00:01:07.344]  I did have a guest come.
[00:01:07.364 --> 00:01:12.606]  We're pulling that down off Infowars.com because I decided, as I do more and more often, not to have guests today.
[00:01:13.126 --> 00:01:22.371]  So we can take your calls and get your response to the news I cover, and so you can bring up other pieces of news and information that wouldn't be brought up if it wasn't for your calls.
[00:01:22.471 --> 00:01:29.375]  I love dipping into that well of wild cards and all the directions that you take us in each and every day.
[00:01:29.435 --> 00:01:31.416]  The toll-free number to join us is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:01:36.325 --> 00:01:38.070]  Big new developments with the dollar.
[00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:41.901]  And I want to go over exactly why they're tanking the dollar.
[00:01:42.887 --> 00:02:06.965]  We'll also then put out the question to you, the listeners, and we'll debate and discuss this, and then your input will be added into the equation with an article that we're going to be putting up on prisonplanet.com and infowars.com in the next day or two, and it'll be titled, The Top Ten Reasons George Bush Must Be Impeached.
[00:02:07.385 --> 00:02:10.427]  What do you think those top ten reasons are?
[00:02:10.467 --> 00:02:12.868]  You can give us one reason, three or four reasons.
[00:02:12.968 --> 00:02:16.729]  If you can squeeze it into just a few minutes, you can give us your ten reasons.
[00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.651]  And I'm going to seriously listen to what you have to say.
[00:02:19.711 --> 00:02:25.233]  And I know that you'll remind me of crimes that I'd forgotten about because there's so many.
[00:02:25.393 --> 00:02:29.475]  How can one mind capture it and hold it all?
[00:02:29.515 --> 00:02:30.476]  So we'll cover the dollar.
[00:02:30.836 --> 00:02:33.017]  We'll get into the top ten reasons to impeach Bush.
[00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:38.011]  Also, I wrote some notes late last night just thinking.
[00:02:38.111 --> 00:02:40.157]  One of them is, it's all lies.
[00:02:41.917 --> 00:03:00.866]  We live in a false reality, and I'll give you a few examples of the propaganda that when I watch a few minutes of TV or listen to talk radio or read the newspaper that fly out from the television, the radio, or the pages in front of my eyes, and just how ridiculous the propaganda is.
[00:03:00.886 --> 00:03:08.209]  I also want to briefly comment on Apocalypto that will be coming out nationwide.
[00:03:09.149 --> 00:03:29.256]  On Friday, Mel Gibson's new, what is probably going to be another mega hit, and I've got several other pages of notes I've written here of topics and issues I wish to discuss, and we will plunge into all of it on the other side of this quick break.
[00:03:29.276 --> 00:03:38.099]  There's also an article going up on prisonplanet.com as we speak by Paul Watson and myself concerning Mr. Richards and his staged
[00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:40.001]  We're good to go.
[00:03:40.021 --> 00:03:40.262]  I think?
[00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:08.610]  So everyone can hear that he has been convicted, when there is a law of hate speech, and he wants to pay hundreds of thousands, if not millions of dollars, to the people he offended.
[00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:16.297]  Again, that was the final sign, the final seal that sealed it for me that this was completely wrong.
[00:04:16.677 --> 00:04:17.479]  We're good to go.
[00:04:29.972 --> 00:04:32.293]  We already have our protest and free speech zones.
[00:04:32.313 --> 00:04:38.157]  They're already talking about, you know, Newt Gingrich arresting people for criticizing the president, banning websites.
[00:04:38.597 --> 00:04:42.199]  This is exactly what they need, and they're moving forward to do it.
[00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:43.700]  It's all coming up.
[00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:48.003]  On the other side, we intend to keep this country land of the free, home of the brave.
[00:04:48.383 --> 00:04:51.825]  But more and more, it's becoming land of the cowards, home of the slaves.
[00:05:02.549 --> 00:05:05.731]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[00:05:06.072 --> 00:05:08.013]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[00:05:08.373 --> 00:05:16.039]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:05:16.719 --> 00:05:23.764]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:05:24.164 --> 00:05:27.106]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran.
[00:05:27.446 --> 00:05:29.808]  The White House program to disseminate fake news.
[00:05:30.228 --> 00:05:31.049]  NSA spies.
[00:05:31.616 --> 00:05:33.838]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:05:33.858 --> 00:05:37.781]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.
[00:05:37.821 --> 00:05:43.446]  Get your copy today at Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling toll-free 1-888-253-3139 or watch it right now online at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:04.505]  Now you can bring Berkey purification power anywhere with the Sport Berkey filtration bottle.
[00:06:04.825 --> 00:06:07.068]  Ideal for sporting games, camping, or boating.
[00:06:07.128 --> 00:06:10.271]  Or Sport Berkey is small enough to store in your glove box.
[00:06:10.311 --> 00:06:14.595]  So it's ideal backup for unexpected emergencies like blackouts, floods, or earthquakes.
[00:06:14.935 --> 00:06:17.938]  It's simply the best personal water filtration system available.
[00:06:18.258 --> 00:06:21.700]  So effective you can drink raw, untreated water from lakes, rivers, and streams.
[00:06:22.021 --> 00:06:31.388]  Unlike other sport bottles, the Sport Berkey's patented filter formulation is so powerful it removes cysts, parasites, harmful bacteria, and chemicals like herbicides and pesticides.
[00:06:31.628 --> 00:06:35.131]  It even reduces radon-222, lead, and other heavy metals.
[00:06:35.371 --> 00:06:42.477]  This lightweight, rugged 22-ounce filter is small enough to go everywhere, so take one to work and keep another in your glove box for emergencies.
[00:06:42.737 --> 00:06:44.098]  Get the Berkey Sport for only $39.
[00:06:45.179 --> 00:06:50.624]  Get two for $70 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[00:06:59.614 --> 00:07:02.036]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network.
[00:07:02.536 --> 00:07:05.858]  Let's ask the question that the Bush regime hopes you will never ask.
[00:07:06.218 --> 00:07:09.180]  That is, is the USA already bankrupt?
[00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:15.824]  As the world's biggest debtor nation, we are borrowing in excess of 80% of the world's net savings.
[00:07:15.884 --> 00:07:20.287]  That's $2 billion per day to finance the biggest deficit in history.
[00:07:20.527 --> 00:07:24.890]  Our creditors are becoming increasingly concerned that the debt can never be repaid.
[00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:27.652]  Japan and China, two of the largest holders of U.S.
[00:07:27.692 --> 00:07:30.454]  debt, are looking to greatly reduce their exposure to dollars.
[00:07:30.915 --> 00:07:33.456]  In fact, China has privately hinted that a U.S.
[00:07:33.496 --> 00:07:37.760]  attack on Iran could result in China's dumping massive amounts of U.S.
[00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:38.680]  Treasury bonds.
[00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:43.564]  To find out more about this, call for a free report on the coming dollar collapse.
[00:07:43.744 --> 00:07:45.585]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-
[00:07:46.886 --> 00:07:47.807]  892-6238.
[00:07:48.327 --> 00:07:57.175]  That's 1-888-8XANADU or 1-888-8XANADU and ask for George.
[00:07:59.237 --> 00:08:06.924]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:11.776 --> 00:08:15.840]  I trust you all had a wonderful weekend in parts of the country.
[00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:16.801]  There's snowed under.
[00:08:18.342 --> 00:08:19.983]  Quite a few deaths caused by it.
[00:08:20.003 --> 00:08:21.084]  We should pray for everybody.
[00:08:23.226 --> 00:08:26.189]  Basically now in the Arctic Circle in the north of this country.
[00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:29.432]  I had a fabulous time Friday night.
[00:08:30.032 --> 00:08:34.476]  Went up to the Austin Music Hall and saw Jimmy Vaughn play the guitar and sing.
[00:08:34.516 --> 00:08:35.517]  It was great.
[00:08:35.657 --> 00:08:38.540]  I'd seen him a few other times, but this was just fantastic.
[00:08:39.272 --> 00:08:40.773]  So I hope you all had a good weekend.
[00:08:40.793 --> 00:08:42.854]  That was certainly great to blow off some steam.
[00:08:42.874 --> 00:08:46.496]  I have no idea why I'm telling that story, but c'est la vie.
[00:08:47.036 --> 00:08:48.797]  It was certainly a lot of fun.
[00:08:48.817 --> 00:08:56.382]  But now we are back here into the battle on another great broadcast yesterday with my new Sunday show that I do from 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:08:56.822 --> 00:09:03.706]  And I was chomping at the bit last night to get back on the air and to continue talking about the things that are happening in our world.
[00:09:04.226 --> 00:09:07.248]  Lewis, Will, Patrick, Tony...
[00:09:08.391 --> 00:09:11.053]  Karen and others, your calls are coming up.
[00:09:11.093 --> 00:09:13.975]  We'll take a lot of your calls today, but I'm going to move quickly.
[00:09:14.536 --> 00:09:19.479]  Once we start going to your calls, through your calls, we give a chance for everybody to get involved on air.
[00:09:19.499 --> 00:09:25.444]  The Litvinenko, former KGB spy, who got poisoned.
[00:09:25.464 --> 00:09:27.926]  There's a new twist, just completely out of the blue.
[00:09:29.068 --> 00:09:35.010]  World Net Daily is reporting that he may have converted to Islam and that Islamists poisoned him.
[00:09:35.370 --> 00:09:36.970]  Or maybe he was planning something.
[00:09:37.030 --> 00:09:44.572]  I mean, this is literally... I mean, if you slip on a banana peel or lightning strikes your house, it must be the Islamofascist.
[00:09:45.332 --> 00:09:51.494]  When there's zero connections to Muslims or Islamists in any way to this...
[00:09:52.444 --> 00:09:54.265]  It's all over talk radio this morning.
[00:09:54.345 --> 00:09:56.767]  I saw it this morning and thought, oh, I'm not going to talk about that.
[00:09:56.807 --> 00:09:57.527]  That's ridiculous.
[00:09:57.927 --> 00:10:06.632]  But I've got to address it because now, you know, they put out the rumor and now it's being parroted as, you know, the God's honest truth.
[00:10:07.193 --> 00:10:09.934]  And this is a sure sign they're going to hit us with nukes any minute.
[00:10:10.955 --> 00:10:18.979]  Neil Bortz had twisted into that when this particular type of radioactive material has nothing to do with nuclear weapons.
[00:10:19.059 --> 00:10:19.900]  It just doesn't matter.
[00:10:21.696 --> 00:10:25.479]  I mean, this is the type of psychological, semantical alchemy that we see.
[00:10:25.499 --> 00:10:32.625]  I mean, Iran's developing a peaceful atomic reactor program, and the media keeps saying their nuclear program.
[00:10:32.825 --> 00:10:33.766]  They're going nuclear.
[00:10:33.786 --> 00:10:34.907]  They're turning on the nuke.
[00:10:35.487 --> 00:10:48.998]  The average American just hears turning on the nuke and literally are running through the streets in fear, while the global crime syndicate, the private central banks, are ending the sovereignty, ending the borders, ending the country right now.
[00:10:51.030 --> 00:10:51.450]  We're good to go.
[00:10:51.470 --> 00:10:51.690]  I think?
[00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:09.561]  I mean, it's a joke!
[00:11:10.421 --> 00:11:13.823]  And let's say the Islamists are going to cut our heads off and drink our blood.
[00:11:14.303 --> 00:11:16.804]  And they're just out to kill us and they're everywhere.
[00:11:16.824 --> 00:11:20.546]  And this Muslim congressman is just, you know, he's going to get us.
[00:11:21.006 --> 00:11:22.887]  Okay, let's say that's true for the sake of argument.
[00:11:23.647 --> 00:11:27.389]  Then stop bringing in foreigners at record levels.
[00:11:28.169 --> 00:11:28.690]  Stop it!
[00:11:28.910 --> 00:11:29.950]  Have a moratorium!
[00:11:31.611 --> 00:11:32.511]  Oh, no!
[00:11:32.771 --> 00:11:35.953]  No, no, no, no, no, no!
[00:11:35.973 --> 00:11:38.054]  I mean, it's just
[00:11:40.235 --> 00:11:53.439]  I literally have, in the past, every time I get tired and want to take off or don't want to fight as hard or do as much research, I've just got to tune into TV or talk radio and listen to these liars posing as conservatives.
[00:11:53.499 --> 00:11:55.980]  It makes me so sick.
[00:11:56.400 --> 00:12:00.201]  And then I am just buoyed with fresh energy to expose these people.
[00:12:00.662 --> 00:12:01.882]  So I've written a bunch of notes here.
[00:12:03.639 --> 00:12:04.519]  Number one, the dollar.
[00:12:04.739 --> 00:12:07.120]  Number two, the top ten reasons to impeach Bush.
[00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:08.141]  I've got my top ten.
[00:12:08.181 --> 00:12:09.281]  I want to hear your top ten.
[00:12:10.221 --> 00:12:16.224]  It's all lies, false reality, examples of that that I just, a few of them last night I was thinking about.
[00:12:16.584 --> 00:12:17.824]  Examples of propaganda and lies.
[00:12:17.844 --> 00:12:18.965]  I want to talk about Apocalypto.
[00:12:20.265 --> 00:12:21.966]  I want to get into several other issues.
[00:12:23.086 --> 00:12:24.147]  And we're going to do that.
[00:12:25.727 --> 00:12:30.309]  But let me just mention some of the top things for the dollar right now.
[00:12:32.170 --> 00:12:42.217]  And these are notes I wrote last night, and then I just typed dollar every morning into Google and hit news, and everything I was projecting is exactly what was there in the news.
[00:12:43.138 --> 00:12:44.099]  But again, it's not hard.
[00:12:44.139 --> 00:12:50.643]  The Trilateral Commission told us in the 70s they would build up the European Union, launch its currency in 2000.
[00:12:51.064 --> 00:12:55.247]  That would then drive down the dollar, which had already been inflated, and would be even more inflated by 2000.
[00:12:56.644 --> 00:12:57.285]  We're good to go.
[00:13:20.989 --> 00:13:38.772]  The European Union, they would then have rapid currency wars, which the globalists own both sides of and would know which move that their central banks were about to make so that they can currency speculate and make unbelievable profits while they fleece the public in this grand game.
[00:13:40.672 --> 00:13:43.213]  Again, massive insider currency speculation and trading.
[00:13:43.253 --> 00:13:48.614]  The reason Soros can't go to many countries is they want to arrest him, but he's a minor player for the Rothschilds.
[00:13:48.654 --> 00:13:49.394]  He's just a manager.
[00:13:51.656 --> 00:13:55.565]  Kind of a fun manager of currency speculation with insider knowledge.
[00:13:57.481 --> 00:13:58.302]  We're good to go.
[00:14:23.721 --> 00:14:24.502]  We're good to go.
[00:14:24.562 --> 00:14:24.742]  I think?
[00:14:40.071 --> 00:14:43.733]  That's how the globalists did it back in the turn of the century, last century.
[00:14:43.753 --> 00:14:45.094]  Well, not two centuries ago.
[00:14:45.114 --> 00:14:47.115]  You know, in 1890 through 1913.
[00:14:47.155 --> 00:14:51.738]  And there's memos on this sent out by the Banking Association.
[00:14:51.978 --> 00:14:57.302]  They manipulated, caused runs on banks, caused silver stampedes, gold riots.
[00:14:58.098 --> 00:14:58.739]  We're good to go.
[00:15:27.927 --> 00:15:32.209]  And then they come to you with a solution to each new crisis, and then their new solution makes it worse.
[00:15:32.549 --> 00:15:43.755]  Then five, ten years later, you forget that it was their last solution that caused the entire financial system to become even harder for the average person, and more destructive, and more debt-ridden.
[00:15:43.935 --> 00:15:54.320]  And then they have a new solution, and it gets even worse, and it's always deeper and deeper down this black tidal pool, this whirlpool, this black hole.
[00:15:56.392 --> 00:16:04.939]  And what does it do for the central banks, the private families that own the private central banks of Europe, the U.S., and now the entire world, other than a handful of, quote, rogue nations?
[00:16:04.979 --> 00:16:10.063]  Anytime you hear rogue nation, it means they don't have the private central banking families of Europe running their countries.
[00:16:11.984 --> 00:16:12.585]  What does it do?
[00:16:12.625 --> 00:16:25.174]  Well, now it allows foreigners and foreign investors, i.e., central bank owners, central bank stockholders, to buy up real estate companies, ports,
[00:16:26.866 --> 00:16:27.186]  We're good to go.
[00:16:55.353 --> 00:16:57.054]  And this isn't just the big rich bankers.
[00:16:57.114 --> 00:16:57.294]  Why?
[00:16:57.314 --> 00:16:59.055]  There's flocks of people from Europe now.
[00:16:59.475 --> 00:17:02.216]  England, especially, flocking here.
[00:17:02.256 --> 00:17:05.078]  I have a Times of London article to do their Christmas shopping.
[00:17:05.118 --> 00:17:05.338]  Why?
[00:17:05.658 --> 00:17:06.538]  It's so cheap.
[00:17:06.978 --> 00:17:09.560]  Pathetically, it's kind of like Americans used to go to Mexico.
[00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:10.440]  Ha ha!
[00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:12.401]  Let's go over to America.
[00:17:13.341 --> 00:17:14.782]  So it allows them to buy us up cheap.
[00:17:16.543 --> 00:17:19.084]  And it also makes us extremely dependent.
[00:17:21.571 --> 00:17:27.575]  52 plus percent of our debt is now foreign held, and it's actually over 70 percent because a lot of the, quote, U.S.
[00:17:27.936 --> 00:17:34.060]  companies, corporations that also hold debt are really multinational, transnational, or foreign.
[00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:39.743]  So about 52 plus percent publicly, that's USA Today, now own U.S.
[00:17:39.903 --> 00:17:40.184]  debt.
[00:17:41.004 --> 00:17:47.388]  And by debt, just to create a dollar, a dollar of debt is created and then given to the foreigners who own the private stock in the Federal Reserve.
[00:17:47.408 --> 00:17:50.110]  So literally they own the money machines to buy us up with.
[00:17:50.788 --> 00:18:02.179]  I mean, if you were on the money machine and everybody accepted it as the only money, they'd have to come to you and give you houses, assets, stocks, and real companies just to get currency that you make for nothing.
[00:18:03.220 --> 00:18:05.742]  Literally, they even charge us tax money to print it.
[00:18:07.102 --> 00:18:08.503]  Boy, that's quite a system, isn't it?
[00:18:08.823 --> 00:18:12.384]  You don't even have to pay to print the stuff or create the zeros and ones in the computer ballot sheets.
[00:18:12.964 --> 00:18:18.606]  So, buy up the U.S., make us dependent on foreign nations as part of the mercantile global system.
[00:18:19.466 --> 00:18:35.412]  Also, destroy middle class savings and debase those savings and create more bankruptcies and make it impossible once the whirlpool is turned on high, which is now happening, so that almost no one can escape total bankruptcy.
[00:18:36.832 --> 00:18:55.831]  Because the elite is always waging war on what they call the new merchant class that arose in Italy and England and, of course, in Holland around 1600 to 1700, the real overdrive of the Renaissance that supposedly kicked off in the 1500s.
[00:18:58.149 --> 00:19:22.306]  But by the 1800s and 1900s, the Rotterbeerans had already cornered that, set up oligopolies and concerted efforts, teaming their resources together through government controls, and now they have total hegemonic global domination, except for a handful of, quote, rogue states, and most evidence shows that those rogue states, many of them are actually covert clients, there to create the artificial bipolar system.
[00:19:23.516 --> 00:19:33.442]  Global view to continue the build-up of a militarized Anglo-American force that's actually going to be used to oppress the domestic populations.
[00:19:35.543 --> 00:19:36.824]  I think I've covered most of the dollar.
[00:19:36.844 --> 00:19:37.965]  We'll get into more detail later.
[00:19:37.985 --> 00:19:38.945]  We'll come back in a minute.
[00:19:38.965 --> 00:19:39.626]  Go to your calls.

[00:19:43.068 --> 00:19:43.848]  I'll give you mine.
[00:19:44.608 --> 00:19:46.069]  Examples of propaganda coming up.
[00:19:46.109 --> 00:19:48.931]  I'll also talk about a film that looks like it's going to be pretty informative.
[00:19:49.391 --> 00:19:50.332]  That's Apocalypto.
[00:19:51.448 --> 00:19:51.969]  Stay with us.

[00:22:00.750 --> 00:22:03.210]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:22:03.470 --> 00:22:08.552]  Did you know that the Bible forecast signs to let us know that we're in the last days?
[00:22:08.592 --> 00:22:15.314]  The book of Revelation says that world travel quickly and efficiently would be one sign and also knowledge would increase.
[00:22:16.034 --> 00:22:19.457]  Knowledge is doubling every two and a half years in the electronic industry.

[00:23:05.450 --> 00:23:07.852]  Do you realize that the race for the cure is over?
[00:23:08.658 --> 00:23:17.082]  The best-kept secret in the world today is that now it's possible to kill cancer without personal suffering, mutilation, and poisoning of your entire system.

[00:24:16.933 --> 00:24:22.877]  Now, in the last segment, I got into how the globalists want a weakening dollar so they can buy up real U.S.
[00:24:22.997 --> 00:24:28.480]  assets with their increased valued currencies.
[00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:36.845]  It's also about making us dependent on the foreign countries and companies that hold the lion's share, 50 plus percent of dollars.
[00:24:37.936 --> 00:24:41.359]  It's about destroying the average American's savings.
[00:24:41.879 --> 00:24:43.220]  It's about more bankruptcies.
[00:24:43.260 --> 00:24:46.843]  But the key is destroying independence.
[00:24:47.643 --> 00:25:01.774]  And I want to break down how it's centrifugal, how they're going to have currency wars in the next decade, until all independence, all private wealth has been basically decimated.
[00:25:02.768 --> 00:25:04.328]  Totally liquidated.
[00:25:04.709 --> 00:25:17.052]  And then once they have total central control and have assinguated the wealth out of the body politic, they will then bring forward their actual worldwide police state.
[00:25:17.572 --> 00:25:19.633]  If you think this is a police state, you're witnessing today.
[00:25:19.713 --> 00:25:21.493]  It is only the vanguard.
[00:25:21.513 --> 00:25:22.854]  It is only the cutting edge.
[00:25:23.734 --> 00:25:27.415]  It is only the forerunners of what is coming.
[00:25:27.775 --> 00:25:30.276]  Let's go to Lewis in California, who I'm told disagrees.
[00:25:30.336 --> 00:25:30.636]  Welcome.
[00:25:32.790 --> 00:25:33.530]  Hey, Alex.
[00:25:33.630 --> 00:25:34.551]  Thanks for taking my call.
[00:25:35.691 --> 00:25:36.371]  Well, there's a lot.
[00:25:36.511 --> 00:25:38.832]  First of all, I want to thank you for what you do.
[00:25:39.272 --> 00:25:48.074]  You turn me on to, well, you really increase my 9-11 awareness, and that's where I first heard about you.
[00:25:48.095 --> 00:25:50.835]  Well, thank you, but you don't have to preface disagreeing.
[00:25:50.855 --> 00:25:51.195]  Go ahead.
[00:25:51.455 --> 00:25:51.756]  Okay.
[00:25:52.036 --> 00:25:52.416]  Oh, no.
[00:25:52.456 --> 00:25:53.796]  Well, that's not what I'm disagreeing about.
[00:25:53.816 --> 00:26:00.238]  Now, I don't know if you want to talk about what I disagree about, or the dollar is really interesting to me.
[00:26:00.768 --> 00:26:03.109]  With what you're saying about the Amero and all this?
[00:26:04.770 --> 00:26:05.050]  Yes.
[00:26:05.311 --> 00:26:07.972]  This is different than the rainbow currency, right?
[00:26:09.713 --> 00:26:10.173]  Okay.
[00:26:11.034 --> 00:26:25.722]  Making the currency be different colors and then changing the face of it and the look of it every few years, the Mint admitted, the Treasury Department, under orders of the Private Federal Reserve, admitted a decade ago was a preparatory phase to prepare you with change.
[00:26:26.142 --> 00:26:27.943]  They took a note put out by Lincoln
[00:26:29.618 --> 00:26:35.502]  That hadn't been changed in over 100 years plus and began changing the look of it.
[00:26:36.242 --> 00:26:41.165]  And that's what they have done so that you'll be ready for even greater changes to come.
[00:26:42.186 --> 00:26:44.287]  But the notes that are actually U.S.
[00:26:44.387 --> 00:26:52.432]  Treasury... I know there's a gag order on the Senate and Congress by a new law that was passed.
[00:26:53.333 --> 00:26:58.796]  And this is blowing my mind because I checked out... You kind of turned me on to this with Aaron Russo...
[00:26:59.605 --> 00:27:00.305]  Well, here's the deal.
[00:27:00.325 --> 00:27:01.306]  Okay.
[00:27:01.326 --> 00:27:03.326]  Go ahead and say what you disagreed about, sir.
[00:27:03.346 --> 00:27:04.327]  Oh, well, I disagree.
[00:27:04.407 --> 00:27:08.208]  I hear, you know, I mean, I disagree about global warming.
[00:27:08.248 --> 00:27:10.729]  You say they just want to institute a global tax.
[00:27:29.961 --> 00:27:32.362]  Well, I don't say that's what their answer is to it.
[00:27:33.103 --> 00:27:35.544]  So let's say it's real, which it isn't.
[00:27:36.525 --> 00:27:38.506]  But let's just, for the sake of argument, say it's real.
[00:27:39.366 --> 00:27:47.611]  What does a global tax, which is first implemented against less than 15 industrialized nations, do?
[00:27:48.251 --> 00:27:49.072]  What does that do?
[00:27:51.721 --> 00:27:53.102]  What does the global tax do?
[00:27:53.302 --> 00:28:03.249]  Yes, well, I mean, how does that, a global tax, into these big private banks, that's where it's going to go, into the IMF and World Bank coffers, how does that save us?
[00:28:03.669 --> 00:28:05.510]  I'm not saying that tax is going to save us.
[00:28:06.071 --> 00:28:13.096]  I'm saying, you know... Okay, but you see the big corporations... Globalists are going to jump in on anything they can, right?
[00:28:13.536 --> 00:28:15.637]  They're jumping in on global warming.
[00:28:15.958 --> 00:28:17.278]  Oh, they can get their tax through.
[00:28:17.299 --> 00:28:19.280]  That doesn't mean global warming doesn't exist.
[00:28:19.744 --> 00:28:21.145]  Just like peak oil.
[00:28:21.165 --> 00:28:22.485]  They want to manipulate the prices.
[00:28:22.505 --> 00:28:27.408]  So you believe peak oil is real, too?
[00:28:27.788 --> 00:28:31.029]  Well, you know, like you quoted Greg Palast.
[00:28:31.530 --> 00:28:32.430]  Even Greg Palast said it.
[00:28:32.470 --> 00:28:36.112]  But if you read his appendix, it says where Greg Palast is.
[00:28:36.232 --> 00:28:37.752]  Why I am wrong is what it says.
[00:28:38.493 --> 00:28:43.495]  And, you know, he says, well, sure, you know, it's oil.
[00:28:45.096 --> 00:28:47.497]  You know, sure, we're going to run into trouble with it.
[00:28:47.932 --> 00:28:50.273]  But he's saying that it was founded on a fraud.
[00:28:50.854 --> 00:28:54.696]  Just because, you know, a clock that's posted twice a day, right?
[00:28:54.956 --> 00:28:56.997]  Yeah, listen, I appreciate your call, sir.
[00:28:58.358 --> 00:29:00.680]  My knowledge is not founded in belief.
[00:29:00.760 --> 00:29:05.082]  My knowledge is founded in facts, and it stands incontrovertible on that.
[00:29:06.503 --> 00:29:14.828]  There is more discovered and untapped oil that has been found in the last 20 years than we have used in the previous 100 years.
[00:29:16.303 --> 00:29:18.124]  Since it was discovered in Pennsylvania.
[00:29:20.025 --> 00:29:20.385]  Okay?
[00:29:21.586 --> 00:29:23.687]  They're finding more oil all the time.
[00:29:24.947 --> 00:29:34.812]  There's a 600 square mile patch off the coast of Louisiana, which they're talking about opening up, that has more oil than what's at Prudhoe Bay in Alaska.
[00:29:37.113 --> 00:29:38.234]  There's too much oil.
[00:29:38.774 --> 00:29:40.995]  They want a false scarcity.
[00:29:42.736 --> 00:29:44.037]  Oh, will you never learn.
[00:29:49.617 --> 00:29:50.558]  We're on the march.
[00:29:51.019 --> 00:29:52.621]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:53.542 --> 00:29:56.286]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:59.671 --> 00:30:02.294]  Send your loved one a timeless treasure this Christmas.

[00:30:36.645 --> 00:30:37.325]  Peace on Earth.
[00:30:37.345 --> 00:30:38.066]  Goodwill towards men.
[00:30:59.933 --> 00:31:04.898]  Now you can bring Berkey Purification Power anywhere with the Sport Berkey Filtration Bottle.

[00:31:18.650 --> 00:31:22.073]  So effective you can drink raw, untreated water from lakes, rivers, and streams.

[00:31:32.019 --> 00:31:35.521]  It even reduces radon-222, lead, and other heavy metals.

[00:32:00.479 --> 00:32:01.380]  Wow, you look great.
[00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:02.540]  I feel great.
[00:32:02.780 --> 00:32:04.721]  I've been using MetaCleanse Colon Cleanse.
[00:32:05.082 --> 00:32:05.382]  Really?
[00:32:05.622 --> 00:32:06.022]  What is it?
[00:32:06.162 --> 00:32:06.622]  How does it work?
[00:32:06.742 --> 00:32:13.205]  Well, MetaCleanse is a natural fiber therapy with ground flaxseed, psyllium, and betonite clay that eliminates toxins from the body.
[00:32:13.325 --> 00:32:15.586]  MetaCleanse is easy to use without being intrusive.
[00:32:15.747 --> 00:32:20.889]  You take two tablespoons of MetaCleanse powder, mix with water or juice, drink, and it does all the work for you.
[00:32:21.189 --> 00:32:21.670]  That's it?
[00:32:21.910 --> 00:32:23.491]  Well, it sounds so easy and convenient.
[00:32:23.711 --> 00:32:24.412]  It is easy.
[00:32:24.612 --> 00:32:31.258]  Plus, the FDA says flaxseed works to prevent cancer and helps with menopause, weight loss, irritable bowel syndrome, and constipation.
[00:32:31.538 --> 00:32:32.859]  It helps with all of those ailments?
[00:32:33.060 --> 00:32:33.860]  That's amazing!
[00:32:34.181 --> 00:32:39.525]  And the bentonite clay and MetaCleanse eliminates viruses and pesticides in the intestinal tract.
[00:32:39.785 --> 00:32:40.086]  Wow!
[00:32:40.286 --> 00:32:41.347]  Where can I buy MetaCleanse?
[00:32:41.787 --> 00:32:44.810]  A one-month supply is available online at metacleanse.com.
[00:32:44.890 --> 00:32:48.773]  That's M-E-T-A-C-L-E-A-N-S-E dot com.
[00:32:48.854 --> 00:32:52.257]  For only $26.90, Metacleanse is shipped directly to you.
[00:32:52.357 --> 00:32:52.737]  Or call 1-800-317-9547.
[00:32:52.757 --> 00:32:52.957]  That's 800-317-9547.
[00:33:12.849 --> 00:33:16.450]  Since Lewis brought it up, let me back up what I'm claiming.
[00:33:18.131 --> 00:33:35.776]  The European Space Agency, the Chinese Space Agency, the telescopes in Japan, universities, the University of Texas, they've all put out reports in the last year showing that every planet has
[00:33:36.367 --> 00:33:39.429]  In the solar system is heating up.
[00:33:41.910 --> 00:33:45.312]  The gases show that they're heating up.
[00:33:46.793 --> 00:33:49.454]  Every indicator, their atmospheres are heating up.
[00:33:49.494 --> 00:33:57.539]  They have telescopes that are able to, by long observation, give a temperature on those planets.
[00:33:58.259 --> 00:33:59.900]  And why is that happening?
[00:33:59.960 --> 00:34:03.202]  Well, you can also find the accompanying data that is Legion.
[00:34:03.242 --> 00:34:05.503]  The sun is studied more than any other planet.
[00:34:05.863 --> 00:34:06.403]  We're good to go.
[00:34:31.525 --> 00:34:33.386]  That is the rays from the sun.
[00:34:33.446 --> 00:34:34.127]  Well, guess what?
[00:34:34.207 --> 00:34:36.609]  It didn't stop at the end of its normal cycle.
[00:34:36.709 --> 00:34:44.234]  It's now continuing to heat, continuing increased solar flares and overall ejections.
[00:34:46.235 --> 00:34:54.101]  And now NASA is projecting that in the next 11 years, the sun could, quote, brighten by 50%.
[00:34:58.124 --> 00:35:01.385]  And the government is panicking and freaking out.
[00:35:02.045 --> 00:35:20.712]  Now, I assure you, we ought to write an article about this, that your SUVs have absolutely nothing to do with the sun heating up and acting very strangely.
[00:35:21.632 --> 00:35:23.913]  Oh, it's happening in our time, my friends.
[00:35:23.933 --> 00:35:25.093]  The sun is heating up.
[00:35:27.092 --> 00:35:34.977]  Now, there's only really been observations that can be in any way called scientific by the Western world in the last 250 years or so.
[00:35:36.598 --> 00:35:51.128]  Why, what, 3,000-something years ago, the Chinese recorded, and they had pretty good science then, you know, a supernova that lit up the sky for a few months, day and night, you could see it, from some distant star that exploded.
[00:35:53.387 --> 00:35:58.991]  But there hasn't been any real data that you can call super scientific but in the last hundred.
[00:35:59.591 --> 00:36:02.333]  And so this is probably part of some other normal cycle.
[00:36:02.393 --> 00:36:04.074]  We better hope it is.
[00:36:04.615 --> 00:36:11.499]  And boy, there's no telling what Revelation says about how your skin will be burned and the sun will be hotter than ever.
[00:36:11.659 --> 00:36:15.782]  It's kind of scary how much of that stuff in the Bible is starting to happen.
[00:36:15.882 --> 00:36:17.924]  I sure hope it isn't time for that, but it might be.
[00:36:20.686 --> 00:36:22.006]  But just looking at science.
[00:36:22.086 --> 00:36:22.807]  I'm a news guy.
[00:36:24.438 --> 00:36:25.518]  And I just look at the science.
[00:36:27.040 --> 00:36:30.862]  And NASA isn't getting their information out of Revelation.
[00:36:30.882 --> 00:36:33.444]  And they calmly report it, but I talk to people.
[00:36:34.285 --> 00:36:39.789]  I mean, you know, we've had Shoemaker-Levy on the show, the Shoemakers and Levy on the broadcast.
[00:36:39.869 --> 00:36:41.530]  We've interviewed the scientists.
[00:36:41.570 --> 00:36:42.151]  I talk to them.
[00:36:42.191 --> 00:36:43.612]  I read their journalistic reports.
[00:36:43.952 --> 00:36:45.493]  I mean, this is what I spend my time looking at.
[00:36:46.454 --> 00:36:47.975]  That's my great frustration on air.
[00:36:47.995 --> 00:36:51.638]  It's why I spend out a lot, because there's just no way to go over all of it.
[00:36:55.948 --> 00:37:01.753]  Now, when I say there's no global warming, the term you're hearing, what they claim is happening, is a fraud.
[00:37:02.634 --> 00:37:07.138]  Now, the Earth is warming, but it isn't warming because of fossil fuel burning.
[00:37:07.158 --> 00:37:15.085]  If you actually look at real numbers, and I've seen them broken down by major universities, humans are contributing to the heat up of the planet.
[00:37:15.225 --> 00:37:22.832]  It's very small compared to the sun and volcanoes, but it is big, and it's concrete.
[00:37:24.093 --> 00:37:27.216]  The bottom line is humans are heating the earth.
[00:37:49.865 --> 00:37:54.648]  And the last time I saw the numbers, it was, you know, one small percentage of a percentage point.
[00:37:55.549 --> 00:38:03.234]  The sun is, though, the main generator of that and then interactions with our atmosphere.
[00:38:04.555 --> 00:38:14.341]  And it is, in my opinion, volcanoes, you can go pull up the ratio numbers, put out many, many, many times what all combustion engines...
[00:38:15.527 --> 00:38:17.528]  ...generate in a single eruption.
[00:38:17.568 --> 00:38:28.094]  Now, let me be clear, because those who try to debunk this will look at, say, a lava flow type volcano that doesn't have a lot of gas being ejected or ash, particula.
[00:38:28.434 --> 00:38:30.396]  I'm not talking about that, particulars.
[00:38:31.096 --> 00:38:37.860]  I'm talking about the big explosive volcano types when, you know, half a side of a mountain blows off.
[00:38:39.224 --> 00:38:53.816]  You know, a whole mountain range gets changed and it ejects that dust into the atmosphere and we have beautiful sunsets for a year because of all the dust causing it to, you know, the sun to have the lens effect and look much larger and to peer through all of that dust.
[00:38:53.876 --> 00:38:54.657]  It's quite beautiful.
[00:38:55.618 --> 00:38:57.819]  But it affects crops, it affects global weather.
[00:38:58.260 --> 00:39:03.424]  These are real numbers that climatologists for a hundred years have been gathering.
[00:39:04.304 --> 00:39:14.286]  But you don't get the big Dutch Royal Shell and Exxon Mobil grants, and you don't get on the cover of Newsweek or National Geographic when you have scientific views.
[00:39:14.626 --> 00:39:16.246]  They've polled scientists globally.
[00:39:16.706 --> 00:39:19.407]  Over 70% say global warming is a complete fraud.
[00:39:20.027 --> 00:39:21.307]  It is a religion.
[00:39:22.287 --> 00:39:26.208]  Climate change is real, and we're experiencing it.
[00:39:26.248 --> 00:39:31.389]  We're always experiencing climatological changes.
[00:39:33.277 --> 00:39:37.300]  So, when you hear the term global warming, by that being a fraud, the Earth is warming.
[00:39:37.480 --> 00:39:38.921]  So it's real at one level.
[00:39:39.621 --> 00:39:44.725]  But it's not real in that what's causing it or what their solutions are.
[00:39:44.865 --> 00:39:45.385]  Okay?
[00:39:46.486 --> 00:39:47.687]  That's all I'm saying here.
[00:39:49.748 --> 00:39:51.970]  And every time I mention this to somebody, well, you know the sun's heating up.
[00:39:52.110 --> 00:39:53.551]  Well, you know the whole solar system's heating up.
[00:39:53.911 --> 00:39:58.695]  Well, you know, here's this university data on volcanoes and the measurements of...
[00:40:00.117 --> 00:40:02.079]  Greenhouse-causing gases in particular.
[00:40:02.239 --> 00:40:02.920]  Oh, no, no, no!
[00:40:02.980 --> 00:40:03.460]  It's the cars!
[00:40:03.520 --> 00:40:04.001]  It's the cars!
[00:40:04.241 --> 00:40:05.022]  Well, just please.
[00:40:05.302 --> 00:40:06.663]  I'm not debating the Earth's heating up.
[00:40:06.704 --> 00:40:08.125]  Can we have a discussion?
[00:40:08.245 --> 00:40:09.426]  Well, the carbon monoxide!
[00:40:10.207 --> 00:40:12.089]  It's going to kill us all.
[00:40:12.349 --> 00:40:13.530]  And the carbon dioxide.
[00:40:14.011 --> 00:40:14.931]  Well, actually...
[00:40:16.647 --> 00:40:22.692]  Carbon dioxide, you know, plants will just grow faster and will actually absorb that and then oxygenate the planet at a higher level.
[00:40:23.052 --> 00:40:32.960]  Ice core samples show that previously we had a higher oxygen level and this would actually be good for human health and the health of the oceans from these core samples from the coral of the Red Sea.
[00:40:33.320 --> 00:40:34.261]  I don't want to discuss it!
[00:40:34.481 --> 00:40:35.402]  I don't want to discuss it!
[00:40:36.262 --> 00:40:42.607]  I just went and saw a movie with Al Gore and now I'm an expert and I'm going to tell you that you're wrong, Alex.
[00:40:42.947 --> 00:40:43.868]  Peak oil's real!
[00:40:43.908 --> 00:40:44.669]  It's all real!
[00:40:49.076 --> 00:40:51.717]  Yeah, and diamonds are really precious when they're not.
[00:40:56.017 --> 00:41:00.098]  Every Christmas, every New Year's, oh, get a diamond for your woman.
[00:41:00.218 --> 00:41:04.219]  Oh, you don't love her if you don't mortgage your house.
[00:41:04.259 --> 00:41:06.800]  Don't put that money in the bank for your children's education.
[00:41:06.860 --> 00:41:08.800]  Don't pay down your mortgage.
[00:41:08.860 --> 00:41:11.041]  Don't get a safer car.
[00:41:11.481 --> 00:41:13.061]  No, no, get her a ring that costs $8,000, $10,000, $12,000.
[00:41:13.221 --> 00:41:14.001]  She's got to have it.
[00:41:21.109 --> 00:41:24.612]  Well, diamonds weren't even popular until about 100 years ago.
[00:41:26.354 --> 00:41:33.740]  But just like Santa Claus didn't wear a red outfit until about 70 years ago when Coca-Cola told us what Christmas was.
[00:41:34.361 --> 00:41:35.361]  Totally changed it.
[00:41:35.842 --> 00:41:37.243]  Overnight with a PR campaign.
[00:41:37.724 --> 00:41:41.387]  Well, they totally convinced you that diamonds are precious.
[00:41:41.427 --> 00:41:44.970]  They're not on even the precious scale.
[00:41:44.990 --> 00:41:46.131]  They're semi-precious stones.
[00:41:47.930 --> 00:41:49.432]  But people will argue with you.
[00:41:49.472 --> 00:41:51.834]  It's an absolute admitted fact for anyone in the diamond business.
[00:41:52.835 --> 00:41:54.937]  It's controlled by the Oppenheimer family.
[00:41:54.957 --> 00:42:00.763]  And DeBure is the name of their world diamond house after a DeBure mine.
[00:42:00.783 --> 00:42:05.508]  And Cecil Rhodes went for the crown and set it up.
[00:42:05.588 --> 00:42:09.112]  And then that family was licensed through the crown to operate that monopoly.
[00:42:10.859 --> 00:42:11.900]  Because Africans, God bless their souls...
[00:42:36.875 --> 00:42:42.660]  Started digging and mining these things for themselves and building up their villages and running water.
[00:42:44.761 --> 00:42:48.144]  And the De Beers will actually... This has been in the news.
[00:42:48.845 --> 00:42:53.489]  BBC, it was a big article back in 2000, in the April issue, I believe.
[00:42:53.549 --> 00:42:54.690]  I read it on there, the whole thing.
[00:42:54.930 --> 00:42:55.951]  Where they bragged.
[00:42:55.971 --> 00:42:56.791]  They were telling the world.
[00:42:56.811 --> 00:42:57.752]  We've got a monopoly.
[00:42:58.152 --> 00:43:00.774]  How they went into Sierra Leone with the gunships.
[00:43:00.794 --> 00:43:04.417]  And you hear, oh, there's some problems in a war going on.
[00:43:04.497 --> 00:43:06.259]  Oh, French and British troops just went in.
[00:43:07.065 --> 00:43:12.227]  I mean, imagine, these countries go, we're going to mine our own diamonds in actual invasion forces.
[00:43:12.567 --> 00:43:25.353]  Stormtroopers hit with mercs and British and French troops, with Dutch mercs as well, and just, I mean, blow up capitals, machine gun people in the streets, gunships just fly over attacking.
[00:43:26.474 --> 00:43:28.534]  That's why your diamond costs so much.
[00:43:28.775 --> 00:43:30.415]  The things lay around on the ground.
[00:43:31.576 --> 00:43:33.317]  PBS documentary, Diamond Empire.
[00:43:34.557 --> 00:43:35.337]  We had the...
[00:43:37.253 --> 00:43:40.015]  What do you call it when a woman's married to a lord?
[00:43:40.115 --> 00:43:42.577]  The lady, the lord, I forget the proper term.
[00:43:42.617 --> 00:43:43.157]  We had her on.
[00:43:43.938 --> 00:43:45.299]  And they went out on her yacht in London.
[00:43:45.359 --> 00:43:47.040]  She was parked there right before it was going to come out.
[00:43:47.060 --> 00:43:48.321]  And they said, we told you not to make it.
[00:43:48.341 --> 00:43:49.382]  And they broke her nose.
[00:43:49.422 --> 00:43:50.123]  And what was it?
[00:43:50.163 --> 00:43:52.604]  Broke her shoulder and told her she made another film.
[00:43:52.624 --> 00:43:53.165]  They'd kill her.
[00:43:53.525 --> 00:43:56.027]  But Diamond Empire, for some reason, still aired.
[00:43:56.047 --> 00:44:00.030]  I remember my dad with his mouth hanging open.
[00:44:01.246 --> 00:44:14.990]  We still lived in Dallas, so that had to be in the late 80s, and we were sitting there at home watching it, and his mouth was hanging open because he said, because in college, the diamond business is all trust, so he worked for these brothers, just doing little side jobs.
[00:44:16.991 --> 00:44:19.352]  That's one of the ways he helped put himself in medical school.
[00:44:20.572 --> 00:44:21.572]  The DeBool brothers.
[00:44:22.613 --> 00:44:23.533]  You know about the DeBools.
[00:44:23.653 --> 00:44:26.694]  They went and bought that land, those diamond mines in Dallas,
[00:44:27.797 --> 00:44:33.738]  Arkansas, and then the government wouldn't let them mine them because of the monopoly, and they sold out for $3 billion to the Oppenheimers.
[00:44:33.758 --> 00:44:34.199]  Remember that?
[00:44:36.739 --> 00:44:41.840]  You can go look it up if you want, but, you know, growing up, I guess my dad was friends with them.
[00:44:41.860 --> 00:44:43.821]  I met them at, what was it, UT or after?
[00:44:43.881 --> 00:44:44.261]  I forget.
[00:44:44.281 --> 00:44:46.942]  My dad's probably tuned in going, no, you're getting the story wrong.
[00:44:46.982 --> 00:44:47.842]  I forget all the details.
[00:44:47.862 --> 00:44:48.402]  I mean, I've met them.
[00:44:48.442 --> 00:44:56.544]  I've been over to their house years ago, back before they got smart, and went and, because they were South African French who moved to Texas, they went and bought land from,
[00:44:57.430 --> 00:45:01.131]  Knowing, quote, for environmental reasons, they'd never be able to dig.
[00:45:01.611 --> 00:45:02.891]  It's not the environment, folks.
[00:45:02.932 --> 00:45:05.452]  They cannot have diamond mining outside.
[00:45:05.752 --> 00:45:09.853]  And then they did do international lawsuits and all that, and the bankers had to buy them off.
[00:45:10.173 --> 00:45:17.015]  But side issue, remember my dad with his mouth hanging open, that they were admitting the big trade secret on national television.
[00:45:20.336 --> 00:45:23.037]  So now you know how it works with diamonds.
[00:45:26.258 --> 00:45:32.421]  What, when Prince Charles married Camilla a few years ago, remember he gave her a big, what was it, a ruby ring?
[00:45:33.101 --> 00:45:35.002]  Because rubies are precious.
[00:45:36.482 --> 00:45:42.385]  But you notice that they're less than diamonds because they've jacked up those worthless stones so high.
[00:45:43.365 --> 00:45:44.586]  Emeralds are precious.
[00:45:46.087 --> 00:45:49.348]  Now the wealthy, the nouveau riche, the new wealth...
[00:45:50.546 --> 00:45:57.288]  The Euro and Ameritrash have learned of this, but they still want diamonds, so they're buying colored diamonds.
[00:45:57.368 --> 00:45:59.148]  Yellow, orange, blue, black.
[00:46:01.388 --> 00:46:03.029]  Because those are precious.
[00:46:05.269 --> 00:46:12.231]  And see, women don't want the pure, unobstructed, without the impurities.
[00:46:12.271 --> 00:46:15.872]  Back it was the white diamond, the clarion diamonds.
[00:46:16.012 --> 00:46:17.652]  Oh, you've got to have them.
[00:46:20.461 --> 00:46:21.522]  You've got to have them!
[00:46:23.284 --> 00:46:26.668]  But see, now the nouveau riche figured out, oh, this is scummy.
[00:46:27.209 --> 00:46:29.131]  I'm a fool if I buy these.
[00:46:30.012 --> 00:46:33.596]  And so they want the colored diamonds, which are still controlled by the globalists.
[00:46:35.398 --> 00:46:37.420]  So, yes, you can get a precious diamond.
[00:46:41.684 --> 00:46:48.207]  Of course, I recommend if you're going to have stones, wear another stone because they don't have a monopoly over the other precious gemstones.
[00:46:48.488 --> 00:46:50.829]  And you couldn't be giving your money to more evil people.
[00:46:52.970 --> 00:46:57.272]  That said, I bought my wife a diamond ring when we got married.
[00:46:57.312 --> 00:46:59.293]  It's got to be traditional, so I'm a hypocrite.
[00:47:03.211 --> 00:47:04.432]  We're all hypocrites, aren't we?
[00:47:04.512 --> 00:47:05.834]  I mean, I use a cell phone still.
[00:47:05.854 --> 00:47:06.494]  I just cannot.
[00:47:06.534 --> 00:47:10.799]  Somebody even sent me another earpiece and I've been trying to use it and I forget and radiate my head.
[00:47:10.839 --> 00:47:14.743]  You know, it's just hard to get out of what they've made comfortable for us.
[00:47:15.444 --> 00:47:23.572]  Kind of like they announced years after they've been doing it that Google is using the audio and video sensors built into all the new computers and on most of the old ones to track you.
[00:47:25.310 --> 00:47:26.591]  To listen to every word you say.
[00:47:26.651 --> 00:47:28.511]  Now, I'm telling you about it before it's big news.
[00:47:29.092 --> 00:47:34.094]  In a few years, they'll be announcing it more publicly to you, just like I've been telling you for ten years about this.
[00:47:35.694 --> 00:47:37.695]  And now, here it is in the Associated Press.
[00:47:37.715 --> 00:47:39.016]  It was also in CNN News.
[00:47:39.496 --> 00:47:42.237]  FBI tapped cell phone mic as eavesdropping tool.
[00:47:43.258 --> 00:47:46.059]  The FBI appears to have begun... Uh-huh, yeah.
[00:47:46.339 --> 00:47:48.500]  The ocean appears to have just now become wet.
[00:47:49.260 --> 00:47:53.662]  The FBI appears to have begun using a novel form of electronic surveillance in criminal investigations...
[00:47:54.622 --> 00:48:01.629]  Remotely activating a mobile phone's microphone and using it to eavesdrop on nearby conversations.
[00:48:02.190 --> 00:48:06.234]  The technique is called a roving bug and was approved by top U.S.
[00:48:06.254 --> 00:48:16.985]  Department of Justice officials for use against members of a New York organized crime family who were wary of conventional surveillance techniques such as tailing a suspect or wiretapping him.
[00:48:17.825 --> 00:48:27.316]  Nextel Cell Phones, owned by two alleged mobsters, John Ardito and his attorney, Peter Peluso, were used by the FBI to listen on nearby conversations.
[00:48:27.356 --> 00:48:32.081]  The FBI views Ardito as one of the most powerful men in the Genovese family.
[00:48:33.098 --> 00:48:35.138]  And it goes on a major part of the National Mafia.
[00:48:35.158 --> 00:48:39.299]  The surveillance technique came to light in an opinion published this week by the U.S.
[00:48:39.319 --> 00:48:40.799]  District Judge Louis Kaplan.
[00:48:41.059 --> 00:48:47.561]  He ruled the roving bug was illegal because the FBI wiretapping law was broad enough to permit eavesdropping.
[00:48:47.841 --> 00:48:53.662]  Folks, the NSA and private corporations as well randomly are sampling your conversations.
[00:48:54.142 --> 00:48:59.663]  All the cell phones under the 96th Telecommunications Act have the software already on them.
[00:49:00.603 --> 00:49:01.543]  When you buy them,
[00:49:02.812 --> 00:49:08.464]  And it just routinely, of course, for myself, it's live operatives listening 24 hours a day.
[00:49:09.836 --> 00:49:11.037]  And you can't just turn it off.
[00:49:11.057 --> 00:49:12.638]  You can't even take the battery off now.
[00:49:12.918 --> 00:49:18.761]  Under that law, they have built-in sub-batteries, but they only run for a certain time, so that can be discharged.
[00:49:18.821 --> 00:49:23.003]  As soon as you recharge it, they can listen, and so you pay for your own.
[00:49:23.023 --> 00:49:23.903]  You say, what do you have to hide?
[00:49:23.943 --> 00:49:25.604]  Yeah, that's freedom, having bugs in your house.
[00:49:25.944 --> 00:49:28.626]  But, of course, they use regular phone receivers to do that, too.
[00:49:28.846 --> 00:49:31.207]  Again, they don't tap the phone itself when you're on it.
[00:49:31.467 --> 00:49:35.829]  They dial into the phone, and normally the NSA is listening to you.
[00:49:36.050 --> 00:49:37.570]  When you pick it up, there won't be a dial tone.
[00:49:37.590 --> 00:49:38.611]  You'll have to hang it up again.
[00:49:40.160 --> 00:49:42.704]  Now they've gotten more sophisticated because people have gotten mad about this.
[00:49:43.125 --> 00:49:46.230]  So a lot of times you'll pick it up and you'll hear like a and then the dial tone comes.
[00:49:46.491 --> 00:49:51.299]  Then you can know most of the time that it's an NSA roving system tap.
[00:49:52.777 --> 00:50:01.920]  And according to NSA folks I've talked to, most Americans, because the storage space is getting better and it's getting bigger in the past, they just did it with select people, you know, a few million at a time.
[00:50:02.840 --> 00:50:13.823]  But now most Americans daily, it's tuning in for room conversation, TV, whatever you're watching, what you're doing, and then most of it's given to select allied corporations.
[00:50:14.504 --> 00:50:19.305]  In spreadsheets, though, just for statistical analysis and population development trends,
[00:50:20.274 --> 00:50:24.097]  Now, Google, of course, has again announced they're going to use the audio and video sensors to do that.
[00:50:25.137 --> 00:50:26.138]  And they just say it's no big deal.
[00:50:26.318 --> 00:50:28.279]  Because they say it's a computer listening, so don't worry.
[00:50:28.560 --> 00:50:36.465]  It'll just put it into an algorithm on your purchasing habits and what you're saying, and then target you for advertisements.
[00:50:36.865 --> 00:50:39.427]  But, of course, there's many other dual uses in that system.
[00:50:40.047 --> 00:50:42.829]  I said I'd take a lot of calls, but I got off into a rant there.
[00:50:42.929 --> 00:50:46.051]  Will, Patrick, Troy, Karen, Jeff, we'll get to you.
[00:50:46.949 --> 00:50:53.214]  When we get back in, I'll get into more on the dollar news, more on the ten reasons to impeach Bush.
[00:50:53.814 --> 00:50:54.415]  A lot more.
[00:50:54.475 --> 00:50:55.335]  It's a big broadcast.
[00:50:55.355 --> 00:50:56.036]  You'll want to stay with us.
[00:50:57.017 --> 00:51:06.123]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[00:51:06.464 --> 00:51:08.405]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[00:51:08.765 --> 00:51:16.391]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:17.105 --> 00:51:24.148]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:51:24.568 --> 00:51:35.973]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iraq, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:51:36.293 --> 00:51:39.735]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:51:40.255 --> 00:51:42.156]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:51:42.516 --> 00:51:46.358]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:54:09.665 --> 00:54:39.314]  The man with the foolish grin is keeping perfectly still But nobody wants to know him They can see that he's just a fool And he never gives an answer But the fool under him Sees the sun going down And the eyes in his head See the world spinning round
[00:54:40.817 --> 00:54:41.438]  Welcome back.

[00:55:24.324 --> 00:55:28.589]  This would make a great Christmas present if you want us to have a little message.

[00:55:44.208 --> 00:55:46.490]  We're one or two days behind, and that's good for us.

[00:58:02.121 --> 00:58:07.204]  Or if you have a local business listening to us on an AM or FM station, why don't you sponsor the show locally?
[00:58:08.045 --> 00:58:13.929]  I'm very thankful to all those stations, and to the network sponsors, and of course, number one, you the listeners, and God above.
[00:58:14.750 --> 00:58:17.312]  Okay, we will start the second hour in 70 seconds.

[00:58:28.636 --> 00:58:31.257]  We'll get into Apocalypto.
[00:58:31.337 --> 00:58:35.319]  We'll get into some of the propaganda I've been witnessing.
[00:58:36.239 --> 00:58:36.640]  It's huge.
[00:58:36.740 --> 00:58:37.400]  I'm fired up.
[00:58:37.460 --> 00:58:37.900]  Stay with me.

[00:58:55.780 --> 00:58:56.420]  Big Brother.
[00:58:57.100 --> 00:58:58.141]  Mainstream media.
[00:58:58.861 --> 00:58:59.981]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:00.642 --> 00:59:01.442]  You want answers?
[00:59:02.202 --> 00:59:03.103]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:03.123 --> 00:59:07.484]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:07.945 --> 00:59:12.326]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:12.806 --> 00:59:16.408]  At the beginning of this transmission, I put the question out to you, the listeners.
[00:59:16.528 --> 00:59:19.109]  What are the top ten reasons Bush should be impeached?
[00:59:19.864 --> 00:59:22.045]  Or if you think you shouldn't be, you're welcome to call in as well.
[00:59:22.525 --> 00:59:24.185]  We'll go to the head of the line if you disagree with us.
[00:59:24.205 --> 00:59:25.246]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:59:25.266 --> 00:59:29.727]  We've been covering what the dollar drop really means.
[00:59:30.227 --> 00:59:32.208]  Also getting to Apocalypto today.
[00:59:32.988 --> 00:59:34.369]  Just a lot of other important news.
[00:59:34.389 --> 00:59:35.249]  You'll want to stay with us.
[00:59:35.769 --> 00:59:40.130]  Right now, let's talk to Will in Ohio, then Patrick, and many others.
[00:59:40.170 --> 00:59:40.751]  Go ahead, Will.
[00:59:41.231 --> 00:59:42.371]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[00:59:42.591 --> 00:59:43.371]  Good, sir.
[00:59:43.531 --> 00:59:45.312]  I just finished watching Terror Storm, man.
[00:59:45.432 --> 00:59:46.332]  Outstanding work.
[00:59:47.093 --> 00:59:48.153]  Really appreciate what you're doing.
[00:59:48.193 --> 00:59:48.413]  Thank you.
[00:59:49.199 --> 01:00:00.524]  A while back, you did a story where the globalists were buying off these pastors here in Ohio, paying them to lead their congregation right into the New World Order.
[01:00:00.564 --> 01:00:13.589]  We got the actual training manuals, 13,000 plus preachers nationwide, and it is actually happening, training them to turn their guns in when the crisis comes, training them to tell the people to submit.
[01:00:14.129 --> 01:00:15.090]  It's unbelievable.
[01:00:15.810 --> 01:00:17.891]  Do you know how I could get a copy of those manuals?
[01:00:20.304 --> 01:00:22.245]  Yes, sir.
[01:00:22.825 --> 01:00:34.373]  We posted that, and they blacked out what they needed blacked out, but still off a fax number they were able to, which they were faxing from another private business, so they couldn't track it back, but they did.
[01:00:34.893 --> 01:00:37.975]  And the pastor who we had on got called in.
[01:00:37.995 --> 01:00:43.999]  When he came into the office, they had my story and everything laying there with the printouts, but that's on the web, sir.
[01:00:44.039 --> 01:00:44.780]  Those are available.
[01:00:45.756 --> 01:00:47.797]  Are they on your website?
[01:00:48.017 --> 01:00:51.059]  Yeah, they're on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:00:51.659 --> 01:00:52.880]  Search engines are great tools.
[01:00:52.920 --> 01:00:54.841]  I recommend folks learn how to use them.
[01:00:55.161 --> 01:01:01.144]  You just type in something like preachers recruited by FEMA, pastors in Ohio.
[01:01:01.985 --> 01:01:02.465]  It'll come up.
[01:01:03.365 --> 01:01:03.546]  All right.
[01:01:03.566 --> 01:01:04.086]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:01:04.626 --> 01:01:05.827]  Yeah, it's a big deal.
[01:01:05.887 --> 01:01:07.248]  I mean, it's just huge stories.
[01:01:07.288 --> 01:01:11.090]  We just report and then glaze over to the next because it's coming at us so fast.
[01:01:11.530 --> 01:01:12.710]  Patrick in Kentucky.
[01:01:12.730 --> 01:01:13.351]  Thanks for holding.
[01:01:13.391 --> 01:01:13.711]  Welcome.
[01:01:14.628 --> 01:01:15.829]  Good morning, Alex.
[01:01:16.329 --> 01:01:19.470]  This is not what I want to talk about, but I want to add this real quick.
[01:01:20.611 --> 01:01:21.671]  I do agree with you.
[01:01:21.691 --> 01:01:31.416]  I don't necessarily agree with what NASA says as an organization.
[01:01:33.677 --> 01:01:42.081]  There was a gentleman here in the Third Congressional District by the name of Parker who was running on the Constitution Party ticket and
[01:01:42.868 --> 01:01:47.472]  Officially, he got 0% of the vote, which I believe he probably got more than that.
[01:01:47.492 --> 01:01:53.458]  There have been people running for mayor in towns in Arkansas, and he and his wife and the neighbors all vote for him, and he gets zero votes.
[01:01:54.179 --> 01:01:54.419]  Right.
[01:01:55.079 --> 01:02:03.107]  And he was calling for factories to be ran on coal.
[01:02:03.681 --> 01:02:04.342]  Right.
[01:02:04.362 --> 01:02:07.124]  I just kind of have a problem with this idea of clean coal.
[01:02:07.164 --> 01:02:08.445]  I mean, I don't know, but...
[01:02:24.088 --> 01:02:36.497]  Okay, if you want to talk about real environmental problems, the problem with gasoline is they crack the oil, they break down the molecule strings using sodium, fluoride, and other deadly chemicals, which then get put out into our environment.
[01:02:36.797 --> 01:02:39.739]  I don't think oil is a wonderful energy source, and we should have moved on.
[01:02:40.120 --> 01:02:45.744]  But the very people that have blocked new technologies are the ones pushing peak oil to artificially jack up prices.
[01:02:46.324 --> 01:02:47.545]  Right, right, absolutely.
[01:02:47.565 --> 01:02:51.128]  And ethanol, another big hype.
[01:02:51.388 --> 01:02:52.849]  But see, just because I come out,
[01:02:54.292 --> 01:02:59.794]  Just because I come out and say what we hear about global warming is a fraud, because it is, people didn't think I'm for oil.
[01:03:00.834 --> 01:03:02.634]  No, no, no.
[01:03:02.694 --> 01:03:11.497]  It's a complex issue, sir, but I'm telling you, peak oil was created ten years ago and paid for for scientists to put out the fraud by Dutch Royal Shell.
[01:03:12.377 --> 01:03:19.659]  Right, right, and I absolutely agree with you on everything and on alcohol and everything, but what I wanted to mention real quick was...
[01:03:21.238 --> 01:03:24.499]  On the news this morning, I don't watch TV very much.
[01:03:24.519 --> 01:03:25.039]  Sure, go ahead.
[01:03:25.940 --> 01:03:27.440]  Well, okay.
[01:03:28.301 --> 01:03:32.983]  One issue they're talking about, pharmaceutical drugs versus generic drugs.
[01:03:33.443 --> 01:03:48.268]  And, you know, basically I don't really agree with any pharmaceutical drugs because of their side effects, but they're talking about how generic drugs, how they're cheaper, but then they're not as good as the real McCoys.
[01:03:48.368 --> 01:03:49.309]  Stay there, stay there.
[01:03:54.597 --> 01:03:57.759]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[01:03:58.099 --> 01:04:00.020]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[01:04:00.421 --> 01:04:08.085]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:04:08.745 --> 01:04:15.810]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:04:16.210 --> 01:04:19.112]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran.
[01:04:19.492 --> 01:04:21.853]  The White House probing to disseminate fake news.
[01:04:22.274 --> 01:04:23.094]  NSA spies.
[01:04:23.670 --> 01:04:26.391]  Or by calling toll-free 1-888-253-3139 or watch it right now online at prisonplanet.tv
[01:04:51.201 --> 01:04:59.467]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[01:04:59.728 --> 01:05:04.071]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[01:05:04.371 --> 01:05:13.278]  The KDF Shower Filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[01:05:13.498 --> 01:05:17.121]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[01:05:17.401 --> 01:05:22.424]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[01:05:22.724 --> 01:05:29.447]  Hospitals, restaurants and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria.
[01:05:29.928 --> 01:05:30.468]  What about you?
[01:05:31.147 --> 01:05:31.807]  Call now to order at 1-888-803-4438.
[01:05:31.827 --> 01:05:33.168]  Order today and save $14 by calling 1-888-803-4438.
[01:05:51.514 --> 01:05:53.175]  Shelly, you look exhausted.
[01:05:53.255 --> 01:05:54.076]  What's wrong?
[01:05:54.356 --> 01:05:55.357]  I am so tired.
[01:05:55.417 --> 01:05:57.898]  I just get so hot at night and can't sleep.
[01:05:58.018 --> 01:05:59.099]  I have tried everything.
[01:05:59.179 --> 01:06:00.920]  All kinds of fans, sheets, pillows.
[01:06:01.080 --> 01:06:02.221]  You name it, I've tried it.
[01:06:02.361 --> 01:06:04.663]  My husband has always been a hot sleeper.
[01:06:04.803 --> 01:06:06.384]  He's never had a good night's sleep.
[01:06:06.604 --> 01:06:08.666]  Then we discovered something that really helps.
[01:06:08.766 --> 01:06:11.007]  It's called the BedFan Personal Cooling System.
[01:06:11.187 --> 01:06:11.708]  The what?
[01:06:11.968 --> 01:06:14.029]  The BedFan Personal Cooling System.
[01:06:14.169 --> 01:06:19.453]  It will keep you cool all night long and will work for everyone that sleeps hot, no matter what the reason.
[01:06:21.794 --> 01:06:22.934]  How well are you sleeping?
[01:06:23.154 --> 01:06:24.795]  Are you getting the rest your body needs?
[01:06:25.175 --> 01:06:29.496]  Sleep disorder centers across the country recommend that you must stay cool to get a good night's sleep.
[01:06:29.756 --> 01:06:33.057]  The Bedfan will keep you cool and give you the restful sleep you deserve.
[01:06:33.277 --> 01:06:36.438]  With our 30-day 100% guarantee, you risk nothing.
[01:06:36.798 --> 01:06:37.658]  Are you a hot sleeper?
[01:06:37.898 --> 01:06:39.118]  Is your partner a hot sleeper?
[01:06:39.138 --> 01:06:42.359]  Or are you looking for the perfect gift for that person who has everything?
[01:06:42.619 --> 01:06:43.900]  The Bedfan is the answer.
[01:06:44.120 --> 01:06:44.940]  Visit Bedfan.com.
[01:06:44.960 --> 01:06:46.840]  That's Bedfan.com.
[01:06:52.202 --> 01:06:54.424]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:06:54.944 --> 01:06:57.826]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:06:57.906 --> 01:07:04.090]  Alright, I'm attempting to move quicker here.
[01:07:04.791 --> 01:07:08.453]  We've got a caller, Patrick in Kentucky.
[01:07:11.235 --> 01:07:20.161]  And he's bringing up something to do on the news with prescription drugs versus generic drugs, which are still...
[01:07:20.959 --> 01:07:22.980]  Prescription drugs, so I'm not getting your point.
[01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:23.740]  Go ahead and finish it.
[01:07:24.420 --> 01:07:29.662]  Well, you know, they're just getting into the thing of how they're going to take your Medicare away, basically.
[01:07:29.942 --> 01:07:33.023]  And that was on Fox News locally.
[01:07:33.383 --> 01:07:39.865]  And then you go to NBC News, and then they're talking about making a debate about organics.
[01:07:40.045 --> 01:07:41.346]  Oh, it's debatable?
[01:07:42.346 --> 01:07:50.449]  And their scare was, well, the shelf life will only last a week, and this and this, and
[01:07:51.622 --> 01:07:57.665]  Oh yeah, if we don't put petrochemicals in your food that are deadly for you, oh my gosh, you'll all die.
[01:07:57.765 --> 01:07:58.705]  Right, absolutely.
[01:07:58.725 --> 01:08:00.606]  That's exactly what they're saying.
[01:08:01.206 --> 01:08:01.807]  Same old crap.
[01:08:01.847 --> 01:08:08.149]  And then you go over to CBS News, and then they're telling you that green tea will not help reduce cancer.
[01:08:08.169 --> 01:08:09.190]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:08:09.590 --> 01:08:12.931]  I've heard Dr. Dena Dell say vitamin C doesn't help you.
[01:08:12.951 --> 01:08:13.952]  I appreciate your call.
[01:08:16.025 --> 01:08:27.772]  If vitamin C isn't integral to life, and if larger amounts of vitamin C aren't good, then why did Linus Pauling, the Nobel Prize winning scientist, get a Nobel Prize for his work?
[01:08:28.813 --> 01:08:32.675]  I mean, sailors would die if they didn't get enough vitamin C. That's what causes scurvy.
[01:08:34.636 --> 01:08:36.197]  The building blocks of your body.
[01:08:37.518 --> 01:08:44.162]  Collagen is formed in a process with vitamin C. I mean, I can't go into how important it is.
[01:08:45.993 --> 01:08:47.234]  But not according to them, man.
[01:08:47.374 --> 01:08:52.577]  White bread and lots of trans fatty acids is very nutritious for you.
[01:08:53.137 --> 01:08:54.458]  Just look at the results.
[01:08:55.238 --> 01:08:59.981]  Let's go ahead now and go to Tony in Vegas.
[01:09:00.021 --> 01:09:00.922]  You're on the air, Tony.
[01:09:01.642 --> 01:09:02.122]  Good morning, sir.
[01:09:02.162 --> 01:09:03.663]  It's an honor to be on your broadcast.
[01:09:03.883 --> 01:09:04.824]  It's an honor to talk to you.
[01:09:04.864 --> 01:09:05.504]  What's on your mind?
[01:09:06.265 --> 01:09:15.030]  I wanted to talk about basically something that's been troubling me is how I see, I don't know, maybe...
[01:09:16.016 --> 01:09:38.973]  Is there some kind of agenda behind why eventually the government admits to what it does and why there seems to be more now in the last five years or so some sort of agenda in the established media to talk about government crimes and government conspiracies?
[01:09:40.735 --> 01:09:43.376]  First off, I want to ask you, where are you calling us from, boy?
[01:09:43.417 --> 01:09:45.238]  It sounds like you're in a big telemarketing nest.
[01:09:46.950 --> 01:09:50.111]  I am calling from a telemarketing office.
[01:09:50.811 --> 01:09:54.892]  Yeah, I can hear about 30 different voices in the background and buzzing phones.
[01:09:55.732 --> 01:09:58.553]  Well, we appreciate you taking time out to listen to the show.
[01:09:58.593 --> 01:10:00.094]  What is this, your lunch hour or something?
[01:10:00.114 --> 01:10:00.534]  Yes, sir.
[01:10:01.294 --> 01:10:04.235]  Well, I appreciate you staying on hold to ask your question.
[01:10:04.935 --> 01:10:11.297]  What you've raised is a very, very multi-leveled, complex issue.
[01:10:11.517 --> 01:10:15.798]  But bottom line, the government... Is he still there?
[01:10:17.501 --> 01:10:18.982]  Oh, you just faded me down because it's so noisy.
[01:10:19.062 --> 01:10:19.462]  Okay, thanks.
[01:10:19.982 --> 01:10:21.303]  And we'll go back to you here in just a second.
[01:10:22.684 --> 01:10:23.544]  And this is the problem.
[01:10:23.584 --> 01:10:26.306]  I want to go to everybody's calls, but this is a very important question.
[01:10:26.346 --> 01:10:31.128]  It would take probably 20 minutes to answer properly, but let me just do it as best I can quickly.
[01:10:33.830 --> 01:10:37.652]  Get a deep breath here and try to calculate the best way to describe this.
[01:10:39.953 --> 01:10:45.136]  Yes, the globalists do intend, as I've said many times, as I said on the day of 9-11,
[01:10:47.506 --> 01:10:49.127]  To allow 9-11 to come out.
[01:10:50.128 --> 01:10:51.109]  That it's an inside job.
[01:10:51.149 --> 01:11:14.908]  But they plan to only blame it on Bush and company and not expose the fact that they are simply figureheads put into power to carry out these operations and then as soon as the globalists have worn them out and as soon as they're hated and exposed, they're cast aside into the dustbin of history and the New World Order agenda just keeps moving forward.
[01:11:14.928 --> 01:11:15.889]  These are shills or
[01:11:16.573 --> 01:11:17.694]  We're good to go.
[01:11:38.013 --> 01:11:39.514]  They will fix the problems.
[01:11:39.954 --> 01:11:49.978]  They will get the evil nationalists of America who tried to set up an empire back in order and make sure that big, strong nations don't pick on little nations anymore.
[01:11:50.298 --> 01:12:00.242]  If we'll all just turn in our national armies and our personal guns, they will then be this beneficent, benevolent world dictatorship, but a good dictatorship.
[01:12:02.463 --> 01:12:05.124]  Now, then at the national and local level,
[01:12:05.999 --> 01:12:07.880]  They will expose the little criminals.
[01:12:08.481 --> 01:12:12.203]  They'll burn some low-level sergeant who followed orders and tortured.
[01:12:13.043 --> 01:12:18.907]  Or they'll burn some army major who has allowed his men to rape and kill somebody.
[01:12:19.807 --> 01:12:26.611]  Or they will let it come out that a governor was stealing money or a mayor was doing something wrong.
[01:12:26.631 --> 01:12:29.253]  You know, they've got the replacement ready for them.
[01:12:30.273 --> 01:12:31.874]  And then, I mean, this is how they do it.
[01:12:31.914 --> 01:12:33.335]  To give you the illusion...
[01:12:34.628 --> 01:12:36.229]  You know, they're giving you snacks.
[01:12:36.849 --> 01:12:39.170]  You know, the cops still bust some people for drugs.
[01:12:39.530 --> 01:12:42.031]  They bust some low-level drug dealers, mid-level.
[01:12:42.251 --> 01:12:43.411]  They never bust the big ones.
[01:12:44.992 --> 01:12:49.313]  Again, and then it feeds the system and creates the illusion.
[01:12:49.613 --> 01:12:59.117]  But you say there's an agenda in the media to expose government crimes only so far as saying it stops with Bush.
[01:13:00.516 --> 01:13:04.478]  Ultimately, you think that there's a globalist agenda behind, say...
[01:13:28.413 --> 01:13:34.199]  The release of Operation Northwoods or Operation Mongoose or Operation Ajax.
[01:13:35.360 --> 01:13:40.325]  Or other operations that... Operation Cyclone.
[01:13:41.246 --> 01:13:41.486]  Right.
[01:13:41.887 --> 01:13:44.810]  So... Well, I mean, what's the global agenda?
[01:13:44.830 --> 01:13:46.031]  Why did Brzezinski...
[01:13:46.715 --> 01:13:47.255]  We're good to go.
[01:14:13.050 --> 01:14:19.496]  Why do they brag about... I mean, why did the former CIA section chief get up on History Channel and admit what we all knew for decades?
[01:14:19.917 --> 01:14:22.939]  Why did he admit five years ago that our government put Mao Zedong into power?
[01:14:23.620 --> 01:14:35.151]  I mean, why did David Rockefeller write a 76 editorial eulogy for Mao Zedong, saying how great he was?
[01:14:35.171 --> 01:14:38.694]  My personal opinion on Rockefeller is that he's just that arrogant.
[01:14:39.522 --> 01:14:43.565]  Well, I mean, that's why he wrote in his own book that he's for getting rid of U.S.
[01:14:43.605 --> 01:14:45.166]  sovereignty, and he's proud of it.
[01:14:45.686 --> 01:14:45.906]  Right.
[01:14:46.426 --> 01:14:52.910]  Would you say that there's an agenda to perhaps cause a civil war in our country, or a second American revolution?
[01:14:53.531 --> 01:14:57.133]  Well, I mean, the globalists, for whatever happens, they have different scenarios.
[01:14:57.668 --> 01:15:01.670]  You know, they may decide to have the illegal aliens riot and burn down every U.S.
[01:15:01.710 --> 01:15:02.110]  city.
[01:15:02.150 --> 01:15:05.871]  And folks, there's 30 plus million, and half of them are ready to riot and burn cities down.
[01:15:05.911 --> 01:15:06.992]  They talk about it every day.
[01:15:07.612 --> 01:15:09.633]  And then they'll love the police state comes out of that.
[01:15:09.933 --> 01:15:11.393]  Or they can release a biological.
[01:15:11.473 --> 01:15:12.994]  Or they can nuke a city.
[01:15:13.014 --> 01:15:15.955]  Or they can crash... I mean, they can do whatever they want.
[01:15:16.635 --> 01:15:21.457]  And for whatever scenario we bring forward, they've got another scenario to counter it.
[01:15:21.477 --> 01:15:22.417]  I appreciate your call.
[01:15:22.818 --> 01:15:23.938]  What they can't counter...
[01:15:25.302 --> 01:15:31.069]  Is their own military and their own police waking up and deciding to join the American people and seeing how controlled it is?
[01:15:31.309 --> 01:15:32.331]  What they can't counter...
[01:15:34.432 --> 01:15:39.157]  It's more and more prominent people going public about 9-11, going public about the Federal Reserve.
[01:15:39.577 --> 01:15:47.044]  And they're just being a new renaissance where people just refuse to follow criminal orders, where people realize how controlled we are.
[01:15:47.605 --> 01:15:57.615]  I mean, the globalists will not tank the economy and will not blow out the dollar completely if they do their testing, their NSA, you know...
[01:15:58.295 --> 01:16:00.917]  Positive slash negative mention sampling.
[01:16:00.937 --> 01:16:03.479]  That's what they do, spying on all of us.
[01:16:03.859 --> 01:16:05.240]  If they know, you're going to blame them.
[01:16:05.560 --> 01:16:07.442]  If they know, you're going to realize they did it.
[01:16:07.522 --> 01:16:08.342]  They won't do it.
[01:16:08.843 --> 01:16:15.327]  You see, by exposing government-sponsored terror, you take that tool out of their arsenal and break it, as Tarpley says in front of their face.
[01:16:15.367 --> 01:16:16.108]  I love that saying.
[01:16:16.828 --> 01:16:23.973]  When you expose how the Federal Reserve controls the market, they then can't plunge it and then blame it on somebody else because you'll know they did it.
[01:16:25.454 --> 01:16:26.555]  Or they're least likely to.
[01:16:27.490 --> 01:16:35.493]  If you've exposed the military's gun confiscation program and we expose how they're going to use a crisis to do it and show people documents, videos, it'll make it harder for them to do it.
[01:16:35.833 --> 01:16:45.797]  If you go out and educate your local police so the Defense Department and Homeland Security and the ADL aren't able to do it, then they will monitor and do test cases and won't be able to.
[01:16:45.817 --> 01:16:50.459]  I mean, this is how they operate, folks.
[01:16:51.039 --> 01:16:54.600]  This is a program, an operation against the people.
[01:16:55.661 --> 01:16:56.441]  Let's take another call.
[01:16:57.065 --> 01:16:58.465]  Let's go ahead and talk.
[01:16:58.545 --> 01:17:01.226]  Karen hung up, so let's talk to Jeff in New Mexico.
[01:17:01.306 --> 01:17:02.086]  Jeff, you're on the air.
[01:17:03.227 --> 01:17:04.427]  I have two topics.
[01:17:05.567 --> 01:17:12.729]  First, this Texas two-way education issue and then massive CHICOM troops in Iraq.
[01:17:12.749 --> 01:17:19.191]  I'm a self-acknowledged non-Hispanic white survivalist proponent.
[01:17:20.089 --> 01:17:36.683]  And I called the local Las Cruces, New Mexico, Neocon talk host about what you said about Texas Two-Step, which I presumed would include El Paso, and he really doesn't believe that Mexican power in Texas public schools has gotten to that strong.
[01:17:36.863 --> 01:17:40.266]  It's TexasTwoWay.com or org.
[01:17:40.886 --> 01:17:43.148]  Hundreds of school districts in Texas are adopting.
[01:17:43.208 --> 01:17:44.429]  I've talked to the families.
[01:17:44.910 --> 01:17:46.010]  I've talked to the teachers.
[01:17:46.070 --> 01:17:47.652]  I've talked to the teachers' families.
[01:17:49.025 --> 01:17:56.690]  Core curriculum, that's English, that's math, that's science, is going to be taught in Spanish.
[01:17:56.790 --> 01:17:59.452]  And if teachers don't speak Spanish, they are going to be fired.
[01:17:59.832 --> 01:18:08.138]  Now, that's the program over, listen, over half the state, which is fine if they want to be American, and most of them do, is Hispanic.
[01:18:08.738 --> 01:18:09.098]  Okay?
[01:18:09.719 --> 01:18:13.941]  It's over 70% in many school districts like San Antonio and Austin.
[01:18:14.562 --> 01:18:16.183]  So in just a few years, it will be 70%.
[01:18:16.223 --> 01:18:16.363]  Yes.
[01:18:16.403 --> 01:18:16.503]  Yes.
[01:18:18.328 --> 01:18:18.748]  Spanish.
[01:18:18.788 --> 01:18:19.308]  Go ahead, caller.
[01:18:20.389 --> 01:18:22.070]  Yeah, I think that's terrible.
[01:18:22.870 --> 01:18:30.993]  Why doesn't Israel recruit the Chinese military to be its mercenary force against the Islamic terrorists in the Israel area?
[01:18:31.493 --> 01:18:40.037]  We need our troops in the United States to protect from illegal border crossings and security of our nuclear power plants and our old growth forests.
[01:18:40.057 --> 01:18:42.178]  Appreciate your call.
[01:18:42.218 --> 01:18:42.698]  Anything else?
[01:18:43.447 --> 01:18:44.229]  No, that was it.
[01:18:44.751 --> 01:18:45.152]  Thank you.
[01:18:45.693 --> 01:18:48.481]  How dare you say we should have... We're going to speak Spanish.
[01:18:48.521 --> 01:18:49.142]  It's the new language.
[01:18:51.317 --> 01:18:52.438]  Ted Anderson from Midas.
[01:18:52.518 --> 01:18:53.099]  It's December 4th, 2006.
[01:18:53.139 --> 01:18:56.762]  Gold's at $6.45, and one-ounce gold coins can be purchased for $6.67, $3.35.58 for half, and $1.67.79 for quarter-ounce coins.
[01:18:56.802 --> 01:18:57.042]  That's $6.67, $3.35.58, and $1.67.79.
[01:18:57.083 --> 01:19:00.125]  On June 4th, 1963, an unknown presidential decree, Executive Order 11110, was signed...
[01:19:15.780 --> 01:19:16.261]  We're good to go.
[01:19:31.258 --> 01:19:34.041]  Midas has the Kennedy vs. Fed document.
[01:19:34.121 --> 01:19:34.561]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:19:34.621 --> 01:19:39.246]  Unlike your liberty, the paper is free.
[01:19:39.386 --> 01:19:40.086]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:19:40.227 --> 01:19:46.072]  If you're interested in breaking the bondage of taxation and debt, call 800-686-2237.
[01:19:46.092 --> 01:19:46.272]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:19:52.819 --> 01:19:53.780]  Good morning, honey.
[01:19:54.140 --> 01:20:00.147]  Wow, the weather is beautiful, the cabin is terrific, and it's the first day of our vacation.
[01:20:00.427 --> 01:20:01.028]  Yeah.
[01:20:01.428 --> 01:20:02.829]  Honey, is there something wrong?
[01:20:03.190 --> 01:20:06.593]  Yeah, I just realized we forgot to pack the travel burkey system.
[01:20:07.074 --> 01:20:08.555]  I can't drink this cabin water.
[01:20:08.996 --> 01:20:10.717]  And what am I going to do when I'm out on the lake?
[01:20:11.098 --> 01:20:12.880]  Now the whole vacation is ruined.
[01:20:13.080 --> 01:20:13.921]  Honey, cheer up.
[01:20:14.341 --> 01:20:16.603]  I brought our Sport Berkey purifiers.
[01:20:16.863 --> 01:20:17.163]  What?
[01:20:17.604 --> 01:20:28.092]  Yeah, I know you're picky about not having pathogenic bacteria, organic chemicals, heavy metals or foul tastes and odors in the water, so I packed our Sport Berkey purifiers.
[01:20:28.372 --> 01:20:33.216]  You know, this is a terrific cabin, and wow, have you noticed the beautiful weather?
[01:20:33.536 --> 01:20:34.718]  Don't ruin your vacation.
[01:20:34.818 --> 01:20:36.640]  Get a Travel Berkey today for only $209.
[01:20:36.700 --> 01:20:37.401]  Or get a Sport Berkey for only $39.
[01:20:37.441 --> 01:20:37.662]  Call 888-803-4438.
[01:20:37.682 --> 01:20:37.882]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:20:37.902 --> 01:20:39.084]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[01:20:39.104 --> 01:20:40.245]  Travel Berkey, not available in Iowa.
[01:20:52.496 --> 01:20:54.877]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[01:21:21.361 --> 01:21:22.822]  Just call our toll-free number, 1-800-516-8736.
[01:21:22.842 --> 01:21:26.305]  That's 1-800-516-8736 for a one-year free subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[01:21:26.325 --> 01:21:26.825]  It's free.
[01:21:26.845 --> 01:21:29.066]  Call now while operators are standing by to take your call.
[01:21:51.981 --> 01:21:58.003]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism, but globalism.
[01:21:58.543 --> 01:22:04.425]  Globalists are concerned with what's good for big business and the American empire instead of what's fair for the American people.
[01:22:04.765 --> 01:22:08.026]  The only antidote to the poison of globalism is nationalism.
[01:22:08.426 --> 01:22:10.426]  Start reading the Nationalist Times each month.
[01:22:10.666 --> 01:22:16.068]  The Nationalist Times promotes a common-sense, intelligent, and passionate alternative to the reigning party line.
[01:22:16.368 --> 01:22:20.469]  Published monthly since 1985, the Nationalist Times is a 20-page newspaper
[01:22:20.589 --> 01:22:22.270]  The Nationalist Times, PO Box 426, Allison Park, PA 15101.
[01:22:46.420 --> 01:23:05.427]  During the little break we just had, I pulled up Texas Two-Way.
[01:23:05.447 --> 01:23:07.488]  I'm putting it off right now.
[01:23:08.309 --> 01:23:13.971]  It says 240 school districts are adopting, and I'm sorry, it's much worse than 100.
[01:23:15.399 --> 01:23:16.319]  I was just going from memory.
[01:23:16.339 --> 01:23:18.120]  I knew it was in the hundreds.
[01:23:18.340 --> 01:23:19.520]  And it's all over the country.
[01:23:20.200 --> 01:23:23.441]  So, core curricula to be taught in Spanish.
[01:23:24.181 --> 01:23:26.461]  Period.
[01:23:26.501 --> 01:23:27.761]  First it's bilingual.
[01:23:28.682 --> 01:23:32.582]  Then it's just amazing.
[01:23:33.242 --> 01:23:34.523]  It's the end of America, folks.
[01:23:35.743 --> 01:23:37.083]  It's the North American Union.
[01:23:37.663 --> 01:23:40.884]  By the way, I found an article where Tom Tancredo's
[01:23:41.644 --> 01:23:45.907]  Media Relations guy, who by the way I've talked to, Tom would always come on in the past, likes the show.
[01:23:46.488 --> 01:23:52.952]  I called a few months ago because my producer couldn't get him on, and the guy's just like, Mr. Jones, well, things have changed.
[01:23:52.992 --> 01:23:54.293]  And I said, oh, has it changed with him?
[01:23:54.333 --> 01:23:56.435]  He goes, no, it's changed with me.
[01:23:57.495 --> 01:23:57.996]  So I talked.
[01:23:58.376 --> 01:23:59.957]  He goes, it's changed with me now.
[01:24:00.938 --> 01:24:05.181]  And I'm not bringing it forward to him, and he's not going to come on the show.
[01:24:09.042 --> 01:24:10.503]  I have the article right here.
[01:24:10.523 --> 01:24:11.463]  No, no, there's nothing happening.
[01:24:11.483 --> 01:24:12.224]  I mean, this is the type of stuff.
[01:24:12.584 --> 01:24:14.045]  The country's dying and we can't even get it admitted to!
[01:24:38.132 --> 01:24:41.334]  I thought it happening for 12 years!
[01:24:42.214 --> 01:24:43.655]  We had the documents!
[01:24:44.415 --> 01:24:45.156]  Dead to rights!
[01:24:45.456 --> 01:24:46.096]  Red-handed!
[01:24:46.856 --> 01:24:47.537]  Open and shut!
[01:24:48.197 --> 01:24:49.778]  Now it's happening!
[01:24:52.419 --> 01:25:03.545]  It's so humiliating that illegal aliens get bank accounts in hundreds of lending institutions in a, quote, deal with the feds to get housing loans, everything, quote, without ID cards.
[01:25:05.109 --> 01:25:05.730]  We're good to go.
[01:25:05.770 --> 01:25:06.190]  We're good to go.
[01:25:24.158 --> 01:25:26.119]  I've been telling you about the National ID card for years.
[01:25:26.179 --> 01:25:31.422]  They were already codifying it, putting it in the computer systems by non-funded and funded mandates of the states.
[01:25:31.702 --> 01:25:40.768]  Then they codified it into law with the Real ID Act in 2005, and I still have arguments with people emailing me on the street going, there's no National ID.
[01:25:41.088 --> 01:25:43.069]  I mean, what is wrong with people?
[01:25:43.249 --> 01:25:44.250]  You know, it's like last week.
[01:25:44.290 --> 01:25:46.231]  In fact, get that clip ready of Cheney.
[01:25:48.035 --> 01:25:49.616]  We play a clip on the website.
[01:25:49.656 --> 01:25:54.380]  We have video of Cheney on national TV saying he was CFR director.
[01:25:54.400 --> 01:25:57.142]  A group sworn to destroy this country.
[01:25:57.262 --> 01:25:58.944]  I mean sworn to destroy it!
[01:26:00.505 --> 01:26:01.306]  It's sovereignty.
[01:26:01.786 --> 01:26:02.687]  It's very life.
[01:26:04.948 --> 01:26:11.774]  And on the message board under the YouTube clip, there were neocons going, it's not true, he didn't say that, it's all lies.
[01:26:12.978 --> 01:26:14.619]  I mean, video of it.
[01:26:15.540 --> 01:26:19.582]  I don't know, because you want to think, oh, he's a conservative.
[01:26:20.043 --> 01:26:21.824]  He's as conservative as Pol Pot.
[01:26:21.844 --> 01:26:22.684]  Here's the clip again.
[01:26:23.325 --> 01:26:25.926]  It's good to be back at the Council on Foreign Relations.
[01:26:26.046 --> 01:26:31.990]  As Pete mentioned, I've been a member for a long time and was actually a director for some period of time.
[01:26:32.731 --> 01:26:36.293]  I never mentioned that when I was campaigning for re-election back home in Wyoming.
[01:26:38.935 --> 01:26:42.457]  So, this is the type of stuff we deal with.
[01:26:44.793 --> 01:26:46.374]  This is the type of denial!
[01:26:46.394 --> 01:26:49.215]  In fact, where is it?
[01:26:49.235 --> 01:26:50.016]  I ought to just read that.
[01:26:50.036 --> 01:26:52.037]  I shouldn't just mention it and then not get to it.
[01:26:54.238 --> 01:26:56.439]  This was from Crosswalk.com.
[01:26:56.960 --> 01:27:01.622]  Dr. Tony Beam, pastor, conference speaker, talk show host, interviewing.
[01:27:03.563 --> 01:27:05.124]  Congressman Tom Tancredos.
[01:27:05.764 --> 01:27:06.825]  He's talking to him.
[01:27:07.663 --> 01:27:19.649]  Name was recently linked to all of these theories, but when asked about congressman's thoughts, Carlos Espinoza, Tancredo's media director, said, Tom Tancredo does not believe the North American Union conspiracy.
[01:27:20.029 --> 01:27:25.372]  He added that Tancredo believes Bush wants to open up the borders, but he doesn't believe he wants to combine the U.S.
[01:27:25.392 --> 01:27:28.013]  with Canada and Mexico and create a unified currency.
[01:27:29.754 --> 01:27:33.736]  The opposite of what Tom Tancredo has actually said, we've played the clips, we've had him here on air.
[01:27:37.837 --> 01:27:46.745]  And moles of the New World Order like this guy want to just sit there and say, oh, no, it's not happening, and fake conservatives like this.
[01:27:46.785 --> 01:27:47.986]  The whole story is a whitewash.
[01:27:48.206 --> 01:27:48.907]  Can you imagine?
[01:27:48.927 --> 01:27:50.628]  How do they pose as conservatives?
[01:27:51.489 --> 01:27:55.412]  How do people keep buying it and buying it and buying it?
[01:27:55.733 --> 01:27:59.776]  I mean, I listen to talk radio now, and I just get gripping the steering wheel.
[01:27:59.836 --> 01:28:00.957]  I mean, I start breathing heavy.
[01:28:01.017 --> 01:28:02.098]  I'm mad, folks.
[01:28:02.518 --> 01:28:03.339]  I love this country.
[01:28:03.439 --> 01:28:04.320]  I actually love it.
[01:28:06.118 --> 01:28:08.720]  This is where our forefathers are from, what we fought and died for.
[01:28:08.780 --> 01:28:11.882]  This is America, the United States, down the tubes, man!
[01:28:11.922 --> 01:28:13.484]  It's already been gone!
[01:28:14.905 --> 01:28:16.746]  We've got a short window of getting it back.
[01:28:17.306 --> 01:28:23.972]  It's like when your wife's leaving you and she ain't ever coming back, and she's down the road about to go over the bend, and you don't know which crossroad she's going to take.
[01:28:24.232 --> 01:28:26.694]  You better go stop her, if you love her.
[01:28:30.176 --> 01:28:31.197]  I mean, this is sick!
[01:28:34.235 --> 01:28:36.999]  And I just want to wring the necks of these people.
[01:28:37.039 --> 01:28:38.040]  I'm so sick of them.
[01:28:38.080 --> 01:28:39.843]  They're lying mouths.
[01:28:41.826 --> 01:28:42.727]  We're on the march.
[01:28:43.227 --> 01:28:44.830]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:45.751 --> 01:28:48.435]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.720 --> 01:28:55.041]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument.
[01:29:14.855 --> 01:29:15.295]  We're good.
[01:29:30.162 --> 01:29:30.582]  We're good to go.
[01:29:53.061 --> 01:29:54.101]  The war on terrorism.
[01:29:54.422 --> 01:29:57.203]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[01:29:57.483 --> 01:30:01.625]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[01:30:02.045 --> 01:30:02.885]  So what do you do?
[01:30:03.205 --> 01:30:07.787]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[01:30:08.267 --> 01:30:10.388]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[01:30:10.889 --> 01:30:11.729]  Sheltering in place.
[01:30:12.108 --> 01:30:12.929]  We're good to go.
[01:30:37.628 --> 01:30:39.131]  Or order on the web at BerkeyWater.com.

[01:32:01.582 --> 01:32:02.343]  More on the dollar.
[01:32:02.363 --> 01:32:17.836]  I put it out twice, at the start of this hour and the start of the last hour, and I said that later in the show I was going to go through my top ten reasons that George W. Bush should be impeached.
[01:32:18.657 --> 01:32:20.198]  I've got a few of them for you right now.
[01:32:21.983 --> 01:32:29.570]  Lying about WMDs, the White House memo, admitting in the memo that they wanted to stage the discovery or get a U.S.
[01:32:29.630 --> 01:32:32.932]  aircraft shot down, flying it low, painted like a U.N.
[01:32:32.992 --> 01:32:33.553]  aircraft.
[01:32:34.013 --> 01:32:34.454]  Right there.
[01:32:34.514 --> 01:32:34.834]  Boom.
[01:32:36.315 --> 01:32:39.198]  Abolishing the Bill of Rights with the Military Commissions Act.
[01:32:39.638 --> 01:32:40.098]  Treason.
[01:32:40.158 --> 01:32:40.619]  Right there.
[01:32:41.399 --> 01:32:42.300]  Totally impeachable.
[01:32:45.303 --> 01:32:47.524]  The no-bid contracts that are totally illegal.
[01:32:47.605 --> 01:32:49.126]  The trillions missing from the Pentagon.
[01:32:51.266 --> 01:32:56.469]  I mean, there are countless examples here, countless reasons that Bush needs to be impeached.
[01:32:56.509 --> 01:33:02.253]  I'd like to hear you, the callers, chime in on this at 1-800-259-9231.
[01:33:02.733 --> 01:33:04.254]  David in Texas, you're on the air.
[01:33:05.375 --> 01:33:05.695]  Yes, sir.
[01:33:05.735 --> 01:33:06.895]  I'm a first-time caller.
[01:33:06.915 --> 01:33:07.916]  It's an honor to be on with you.
[01:33:08.176 --> 01:33:08.536]  Welcome.
[01:33:09.777 --> 01:33:13.019]  I saw a show last week on ABC called Cheap in America.
[01:33:13.539 --> 01:33:14.080]  It was about...
[01:33:15.875 --> 01:33:22.960]  Who in America gives the most money to charity and things of that nature and was using a bunch of the billionaires as poster boys of giving.
[01:33:23.240 --> 01:33:26.342]  And it's number one, it is Bill Gates.
[01:33:26.382 --> 01:33:28.284]  Number two, it's Warren Buffett.
[01:33:28.344 --> 01:33:29.584]  But they're not giving their money.
[01:33:29.604 --> 01:33:37.610]  They're putting it into tax-free foundations where they then double their money effectively, taking it out of taxation.
[01:33:37.650 --> 01:33:39.251]  But only super elites...
[01:33:39.751 --> 01:33:40.552]  I don't doubt that one single bit.
[01:33:40.572 --> 01:33:41.232]  I didn't know any of that.
[01:33:41.252 --> 01:33:48.636]  But what I saw that was very interesting was Ted Turner was kind of the poster boy they were using at the moment that they were talking to.
[01:34:03.914 --> 01:34:06.016]  Because he's given the largest percentage of his wealth.
[01:34:06.797 --> 01:34:10.840]  Right, and he owns CNN and AOL and things like that for people who don't know.
[01:34:11.340 --> 01:34:16.545]  Anyway, what he's got left... He did own, back in the late 90s, he sold his controlling interest.
[01:34:19.507 --> 01:34:22.690]  Well, in... Sure, sure, so they're showing him, go ahead.
[01:34:23.090 --> 01:34:28.235]  Right, and right now they're saying he has, publicly they're saying he has $2 billion left.
[01:34:29.270 --> 01:34:42.514]  And he's given a billion to the UN, and now he wants to give another billion, because they count the billion he's given off the record, when he's only really given about $100 million of that, which was a small percentage in, what, the last seven, eight years.
[01:34:42.834 --> 01:34:43.934]  There's almost nine now.
[01:34:43.954 --> 01:34:50.536]  He gave it, I guess, a 98, which is actually only a small percentage of the gains that tax-free money's now made.
[01:34:51.236 --> 01:34:51.856]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:34:51.876 --> 01:34:53.236]  He's a big UN guy.
[01:34:53.256 --> 01:34:55.237]  As a matter of fact, I think it was him a while back that...
[01:34:56.384 --> 01:34:59.166]  Made a speech about some Georgia Guidestone depopulation stuff.
[01:34:59.727 --> 01:35:11.756]  Yeah, the money goes for the special vaccines for the black children, and then he can't control himself and gives speeches calling us useless eaters and feeders that need to be exterminated.
[01:35:13.457 --> 01:35:16.720]  Right, well, the... Oh, let's take vaccines he paid for!
[01:35:18.211 --> 01:35:21.233]  Yeah, I've been spreading the word about vaccines for a while now.
[01:35:21.273 --> 01:35:21.993]  Pure evil.
[01:35:22.013 --> 01:35:23.074]  The guy is pure evil.
[01:35:23.494 --> 01:35:24.214]  I totally agree.
[01:35:24.415 --> 01:35:29.958]  The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation gives large portions to help the children, too, with those shots.
[01:35:32.019 --> 01:35:33.220]  Yeah, that's why I use Linux.
[01:35:33.300 --> 01:35:34.040]  No Microsoft stuff.
[01:35:34.360 --> 01:35:37.222]  But what he said was... I sent an email.
[01:35:37.302 --> 01:35:38.102]  I know you all get a lot of email.
[01:35:38.503 --> 01:35:41.564]  The title was, Ted Turner Predicts Stiglitz Depression.
[01:35:42.425 --> 01:35:45.947]  And he did this in this Cheap in America video.
[01:35:46.563 --> 01:35:56.048]  And John Stossel was the guy that was interviewing him, and he asked him, you know, you've got $2 billion left, isn't that enough to live on?
[01:35:56.088 --> 01:35:57.328]  Can't you give some more that way?
[01:35:58.229 --> 01:36:05.952]  And he basically said that he was too poor, and that $2 billion really isn't enough, and that he made the comment that it could evaporate tomorrow.
[01:36:06.773 --> 01:36:13.256]  And he backed that up by saying that about five years ago he had $10 billion, and today he only has $2 billion.
[01:36:13.689 --> 01:36:15.469]  And he attributed inflation to that.
[01:36:15.769 --> 01:36:16.029]  Yeah.
[01:36:16.350 --> 01:36:21.811]  And then after that, John Stossel goes, well, why don't you just put it in a savings account?
[01:36:22.231 --> 01:36:27.111]  And then he got that same smirk that Oliver North did when he was testifying about the Contras.
[01:36:27.692 --> 01:36:33.293]  He looked at the public with that, I know more than you, but I'm just going to give you a little tidbit thing.
[01:36:33.973 --> 01:36:37.773]  And he looked straight in the camera and he goes, well, the banks could close.
[01:36:39.054 --> 01:36:40.554]  And then they went on like that was no big deal.
[01:36:41.721 --> 01:36:44.082]  Sounds like he knows something that we aren't supposed to know.
[01:36:44.122 --> 01:36:46.683]  And that was a John Stossel report, Cheap in America.
[01:36:47.004 --> 01:36:49.705]  Yes, sir, and I emailed you about it.
[01:36:50.445 --> 01:36:54.687]  I found the place where they put it on sale, where you can buy that DVD.
[01:36:55.067 --> 01:37:02.011]  And oddly enough, in the description of the DVD, they used the exact same quote out of that whole hour's worth of thing that I was talking about.
[01:37:02.351 --> 01:37:04.092]  But it's not an exact quote.
[01:37:04.132 --> 01:37:06.133]  They put it as an exact quote, but it's not.
[01:37:06.173 --> 01:37:06.833]  They butchered it.
[01:37:06.873 --> 01:37:08.674]  They left out the part about the savings account.
[01:37:09.458 --> 01:37:11.339]  Well, I mean, they have to cut down a quote.
[01:37:11.399 --> 01:37:12.920]  It's too long for the back of a DVD.
[01:37:13.260 --> 01:37:17.122]  Listen, do me a favor, because I'll end up... Somebody send it to me, or somebody YouTube it.
[01:37:17.142 --> 01:37:18.022]  We'll try to find it.
[01:37:19.242 --> 01:37:20.743]  Sheep in America, John Stossel.
[01:37:20.763 --> 01:37:21.643]  I'll bet it's on YouTube.
[01:37:21.864 --> 01:37:24.325]  Go check that, John, and see if we can play that.
[01:37:24.585 --> 01:37:25.965]  Okay, thank you so much.
[01:37:26.045 --> 01:37:26.706]  Great caller.
[01:37:26.746 --> 01:37:29.507]  I love callers like that that bring some info to the table.
[01:37:30.911 --> 01:37:34.314]  Yeah, we had Stiglitz on, what, three, four weeks ago, talking about global depression.
[01:37:34.674 --> 01:37:36.075]  If the same policies are continued.
[01:37:36.135 --> 01:37:36.956]  I said, are they continuing?
[01:37:37.256 --> 01:37:39.278]  He said, yeah, with wanton abandon.
[01:37:39.298 --> 01:37:43.181]  I forget the exact quote, but he said, yeah, they're just barreling forward.
[01:37:45.042 --> 01:37:45.663]  But don't worry.
[01:37:45.703 --> 01:37:46.443]  Don't worry about that.
[01:37:46.463 --> 01:37:50.727]  It's the Islamofascists you've got to worry about that they're bringing into the country at record levels.
[01:37:51.087 --> 01:37:58.153]  The same people getting rid of our sovereignty, getting rid of the country, destroying the dollar, getting our troops killed, that put Saddam in, that created Al-Qaeda.
[01:37:58.817 --> 01:37:59.537]  Think about this.
[01:38:00.277 --> 01:38:07.059]  They are the very ones telling you, be patriotic, and then surrounding themselves with the aura of the troops.
[01:38:07.520 --> 01:38:09.580]  And then if you support the troops, you support the war.
[01:38:09.620 --> 01:38:15.482]  And I see all these people strutting around, feeling good about themselves, concerning it.
[01:38:15.522 --> 01:38:17.162]  That's not how you really support the troops.
[01:38:18.883 --> 01:38:22.604]  It isn't by festooning your car with a plastic flag made by Chinese slaves.
[01:38:23.024 --> 01:38:25.685]  It's by actually finding out what the troops are going through.
[01:38:26.334 --> 01:38:29.096]  And you go, well, the troops believe in the war because they're brainwashed.
[01:38:29.116 --> 01:38:30.197]  They're 20 years old.
[01:38:30.217 --> 01:38:33.439]  I mean, last night, I meant to talk about this later.
[01:38:33.479 --> 01:38:34.180]  In fact, I will.
[01:38:35.221 --> 01:38:42.346]  On KLBJ here locally, they were playing like little 5-10 minute clips of Army radio out of Baghdad.
[01:38:43.747 --> 01:38:47.090]  And I mean, it was just all propaganda.
[01:38:47.110 --> 01:38:50.612]  I thought I was in another dimension.
[01:38:50.672 --> 01:38:54.035]  It just was so... Everything was a lie.
[01:38:54.665 --> 01:38:58.308]  To try to break down those lies would take hours.
[01:38:59.749 --> 01:39:03.852]  One thing they did in the piece was it kept going.
[01:39:03.872 --> 01:39:06.574]  We found Al Qaeda suspects.
[01:39:06.654 --> 01:39:12.978]  They had a ball of copper wire.
[01:39:13.038 --> 01:39:14.820]  They had the IUD components.
[01:39:16.761 --> 01:39:17.782]  They had guns.
[01:39:19.033 --> 01:39:30.118]  And here's major such-and-such reporting on it, and it says, In the Al-Qaeda-controlled area of Stronghold, we arrested ten males, and blah, blah, blah, a major blow against Al-Qaeda.
[01:39:32.680 --> 01:39:34.921]  And see, we see that lie, we hear that lie every day.
[01:39:34.981 --> 01:39:48.207]  It's like Fox News aired the video cards home, where they videotape the troops saying hi to their families, and what's behind them in Baghdad is two huge towers, the World Trade Center towers.
[01:39:49.227 --> 01:39:49.847]  What does that do?
[01:39:50.387 --> 01:39:53.608]  It evokes the image of we're here because of 9-11.
[01:39:53.648 --> 01:39:56.048]  We're here because Iraq attacked us.
[01:39:56.348 --> 01:39:59.529]  People got to think they were attacked to be over there doing all this.
[01:40:00.309 --> 01:40:03.670]  It's like Hitler attacked himself in 1939 to blame it on Poland.
[01:40:04.270 --> 01:40:04.930]  It's the same thing.
[01:40:04.950 --> 01:40:07.250]  And then you hear that lie again.
[01:40:07.270 --> 01:40:09.351]  They always were fighting Al-Qaeda.
[01:40:09.371 --> 01:40:10.391]  We're fighting Al-Qaeda.
[01:40:10.451 --> 01:40:11.991]  That isn't Al-Qaeda over there.
[01:40:12.031 --> 01:40:14.052]  It's always foreign fighters, foreign fighters.
[01:40:14.492 --> 01:40:15.872]  Then British Special Forces...
[01:40:16.960 --> 01:40:17.360]  And U.S.
[01:40:17.380 --> 01:40:26.686]  Special Forces have been in the AP, BBC, saying that we control the entire frontier, especially the mountainous region, the desert region between Iran.
[01:40:27.346 --> 01:40:28.807]  Nothing is coming through.
[01:40:29.568 --> 01:40:30.128]  Zero.
[01:40:30.188 --> 01:40:33.010]  They search every car coming through at the major highway checkpoints.
[01:40:33.610 --> 01:40:34.651]  Nothing is coming in.
[01:40:34.671 --> 01:40:44.957]  You know, you've got that propaganda that it's all coming in through there, and then they tell the truth and go, oh, we're going to Iran to help us end the violence.
[01:40:45.577 --> 01:40:46.558]  They're actually against it.
[01:40:49.087 --> 01:40:53.189]  You've got the James Baker group, then you've got the neocons that really all joined at the hip.
[01:40:53.930 --> 01:40:56.091]  I mean, it's not reality-based.
[01:40:56.351 --> 01:40:57.291]  We just hear this every day.
[01:40:57.612 --> 01:40:58.772]  Oh, we're fighting Al-Qaeda.
[01:40:58.792 --> 01:41:00.393]  We're fighting Al-Qaeda.
[01:41:00.853 --> 01:41:09.078]  And you've got to believe, folks, if they blow out the economy, bring in foreign troops, and are taking you to FEMA camps and you fight back, you're going to be called Al-Qaeda, too.
[01:41:11.960 --> 01:41:26.328]  Al-Qaeda, and this has been declassified, we knew this from our sources, but now it's been admitted, was the name of the computer program in the 80s set up in 79 by Zbigniew Brzezinski and Operation Cyclone for all the Muslim groups they controlled and funded.
[01:41:29.550 --> 01:41:30.351]  That's the name!
[01:41:31.011 --> 01:41:34.153]  So see, when Bush gets up there and says Al-Qaeda, it's a sick joke!
[01:41:37.195 --> 01:41:37.795]  Oh, man.
[01:41:40.314 --> 01:41:42.275]  And then they're always saying, well, Al-Qaeda says they'll nuke us.
[01:41:42.355 --> 01:41:43.596]  Al-Qaeda says they have nukes.
[01:41:44.217 --> 01:41:55.964]  And then they use some white guy whose grandpa was like number two at the ADL up there saying he's American Al-Qaeda and going to nuke us.
[01:41:56.024 --> 01:41:58.766]  I mean, if that isn't transparent, what is?
[01:42:00.547 --> 01:42:04.190]  They think we're so dumb they killed Al-Zakari how many times?
[01:42:04.670 --> 01:42:06.011]  They wounded him how many times?
[01:42:06.932 --> 01:42:07.393]  We're good to go.
[01:42:29.389 --> 01:42:30.929]  Well, the evidence of that takes hours to cover.
[01:42:31.390 --> 01:42:34.110]  Like his laptop being shared with 9-11 hijackers.
[01:42:34.430 --> 01:42:38.571]  I mean, you can't make this type of stuff up.
[01:42:38.691 --> 01:42:42.112]  Or maybe he got wise to what he was involved in at 9-11.
[01:42:43.413 --> 01:42:46.293]  But they already put that boy out of his misery before they sawed his head off.
[01:42:47.774 --> 01:42:55.135]  The fat bin Laden with the nose that has doubled in size and gained 200 pounds and then they do a voice print and it's not bin Laden.
[01:42:55.336 --> 01:42:55.856]  Voice prints 100%!
[01:43:03.891 --> 01:43:06.472]  I've been in people's cars where the car recognizes their voice.
[01:43:06.492 --> 01:43:08.253]  You know what voice identification is, don't you?
[01:43:11.214 --> 01:43:15.235]  That's in my list of lies and propaganda that I heard just last night on the radio I wanted to cover.
[01:43:19.537 --> 01:43:23.359]  Let's go ahead and talk to Jenna in Ontario.
[01:43:23.419 --> 01:43:23.719]  Welcome.
[01:43:24.219 --> 01:43:24.919]  Hello, Alex.
[01:43:25.139 --> 01:43:25.619]  Hi, Jenna.
[01:43:25.760 --> 01:43:26.540]  Thanks for having me.
[01:43:27.591 --> 01:43:36.868]  I actually, I've been listening for a couple years now, and I tell a lot of people, pretty much everyone I meet, to tune in, and what I find is that
[01:43:37.324 --> 01:43:40.485]  Most Canadians are actually very receptive to this information.
[01:43:40.905 --> 01:43:42.126]  We have a ton of Canadians.
[01:43:42.186 --> 01:43:45.847]  In fact, the ratio, you've got what, 32 million Canadians?
[01:43:46.308 --> 01:43:46.888]  Absolutely.
[01:43:46.908 --> 01:43:54.291]  Okay, well, I'd say 10% of our calls are Canadian, so that's a much bigger ratio for your actual population.
[01:43:54.691 --> 01:44:01.594]  Absolutely, and that's great, but I find that they're very unwilling to believe that it applies to us.
[01:44:02.369 --> 01:44:05.031]  You know, like... Canada is worse than the U.S.
[01:44:05.171 --> 01:44:10.074]  I know, I know, and I'm just wondering, what can I tell these people to get it across to them?
[01:44:10.115 --> 01:44:12.796]  They're ignoring our own politics now.
[01:44:13.377 --> 01:44:19.041]  You know, like, they're very interested in what's going on down south, and they're just completely ignoring what's going on here.
[01:44:19.061 --> 01:44:19.921]  Well, see, that's what happens.
[01:44:19.941 --> 01:44:25.125]  The same media outfits on your media predominantly, that on our media, that on the British media, that on the German media.
[01:44:25.545 --> 01:44:27.407]  And what they'll do is...
[01:44:28.610 --> 01:44:32.451]  They'll sit there and propagandize in England and talk about everything bad here.
[01:44:32.891 --> 01:44:34.932]  Our media will report on what's happening bad there.
[01:44:35.272 --> 01:44:42.154]  And it always gives the illusion that, oh, it's only happening over there, while at the same time conditioning you to accept whatever you're reading about.
[01:44:42.434 --> 01:44:43.054]  Exactly.
[01:44:43.074 --> 01:44:44.314]  Exactly.
[01:44:44.374 --> 01:44:49.136]  I would just love for everyone to realize that it happens everywhere.
[01:44:49.576 --> 01:44:50.556]  Not to just focus on...
[01:44:51.167 --> 01:44:52.288]  Well, I'm not knocking Canada.
[01:44:52.448 --> 01:44:55.570]  Canadians are the nicest people that I've ever met.
[01:44:55.931 --> 01:44:58.733]  And they're very smart and very friendly and very professional people.
[01:44:59.153 --> 01:45:07.699]  But let me tell you, there is no country that I've been to or heard of that is a bigger police state where they... I mean, listen, we can get stuff into Beijing, China.
[01:45:07.739 --> 01:45:08.580]  Snap your fingers.
[01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:10.822]  We can get stuff into England.
[01:45:10.842 --> 01:45:12.683]  We can get stuff into Australia.
[01:45:12.703 --> 01:45:13.984]  We can get stuff into Russia.
[01:45:14.324 --> 01:45:20.229]  But man, we had to go exclusively to UPS and they still rip into that and trash maybe one out of ten packages.
[01:45:20.709 --> 01:45:21.089]  Absolutely.
[01:45:21.109 --> 01:45:21.450]  That's right.
[01:45:50.427 --> 01:45:54.289]  And they're taking your free speech, they're taking your land rights, they're going after your farmers.
[01:45:56.150 --> 01:45:56.630]  It's bad.
[01:45:57.371 --> 01:45:57.851]  I agree.
[01:45:58.791 --> 01:45:59.392]  I'm so glad.
[01:45:59.472 --> 01:46:00.952]  That's all I wanted everyone to know.
[01:46:02.453 --> 01:46:03.614]  Well, I appreciate you calling.
[01:46:03.634 --> 01:46:09.196]  One thing I have noticed is the Canadian papers have reported on the North American Union and how serious it is.
[01:46:09.477 --> 01:46:09.757]  Yes.
[01:46:11.057 --> 01:46:12.018]  Oh, of course, they will.
[01:46:12.098 --> 01:46:19.922]  As long as the Canadians keep thinking that we're safe and that we're some kind of safe haven or something, then...
[01:46:20.834 --> 01:46:22.335]  We'll be supportive of everyone else.
[01:46:22.435 --> 01:46:26.458]  It's when they just don't focus on our news at all at this point.
[01:46:27.058 --> 01:46:27.839]  Well, let me tell you.
[01:46:27.939 --> 01:46:29.060]  I mean, I've been in England.
[01:46:29.120 --> 01:46:30.401]  I've been in Latin America.
[01:46:30.421 --> 01:46:31.621]  I've been in third world countries.
[01:46:32.302 --> 01:46:38.306]  And I have, I mean, they could only be described as Nazi-like at that customs facility.
[01:46:39.307 --> 01:46:39.767]  Pretty much.
[01:46:39.827 --> 01:46:41.188]  And they knew exactly who I was.
[01:46:42.270 --> 01:46:43.051]  Wait till you see the film.
[01:46:59.051 --> 01:47:05.053]  We will sell no wine until it's time, as Orson Welles would say, but this is going to be the blockbuster of all time when it comes out.
[01:47:05.573 --> 01:47:10.734]  I wish I could just drop everything, not do the radio, not do interviews, do nothing, and just work on this film, but I can't.
[01:47:10.754 --> 01:47:15.915]  I've got to beat my brains out to make the film and just work on it at night, but we're doing it.
[01:47:17.516 --> 01:47:18.016]  Anything else?
[01:47:18.576 --> 01:47:19.356]  No, that's it.
[01:47:19.416 --> 01:47:20.016]  Thank you so much.
[01:47:20.076 --> 01:47:20.757]  We love you here.
[01:47:20.917 --> 01:47:21.877]  Well, we love you too, Jenna.
[01:47:22.077 --> 01:47:22.497]  Keep it up.
[01:47:22.877 --> 01:47:26.458]  Let's talk to Johnny in... Where are you calling from, Johnny?
[01:47:27.210 --> 01:47:28.351]  I'm from Vancouver, Canada.
[01:47:28.551 --> 01:47:31.833]  Ah, speak of the devil, another Canadian.
[01:47:32.334 --> 01:47:35.936]  Yeah, I'm a little concerned with the package that I sent you.
[01:47:35.956 --> 01:47:38.538]  It's got a t-shirt, some DVDs and a letter.
[01:47:39.759 --> 01:47:56.490]  And I was checking my blogger stats and I noticed that the package was probably received in the United States because a .gov address came up basically on my website and I looked into it and it ends up being
[01:47:57.028 --> 01:47:57.428]  The U.S.
[01:47:57.508 --> 01:48:00.630]  Postal Service Law Enforcement Division.
[01:48:01.410 --> 01:48:08.454]  So, somebody over there obviously opened up the package, checked out my blog, because that was in the literature that I sent you.
[01:48:08.494 --> 01:48:09.515]  Oh yeah, that's the freedom.
[01:48:09.555 --> 01:48:16.899]  I mean, I remember when I had family living in Guatemala, they were doing work down there in the 80s, and I remember being sent...
[01:48:17.751 --> 01:48:18.533]  We're good to go.
[01:48:27.970 --> 01:48:35.653]  And so you're saying that, well, I mean, just because some government site contacted your ISP, governments, I mean, there's employees all over the web.
[01:48:35.993 --> 01:48:40.575]  I mean, I get hit by millions, I'm not kidding, every month of government ISPs.
[01:48:40.915 --> 01:48:44.396]  So most of the time that doesn't mean that there is an employee on their lunch hour.
[01:48:45.817 --> 01:48:46.777]  Have you gotten the package?
[01:48:47.197 --> 01:48:47.798]  I don't know, man.
[01:48:47.858 --> 01:48:48.918]  I get hundreds of packages.
[01:48:48.958 --> 01:48:49.778]  We try to go through it all.
[01:48:50.258 --> 01:48:51.859]  It's a 9-11 inside job T-shirt.
[01:48:52.059 --> 01:48:52.959]  Oh, thank you.
[01:48:53.280 --> 01:48:54.280]  If you get it.
[01:48:55.388 --> 01:48:57.090]  Just fire off an email if you have a second.
[01:48:57.130 --> 01:48:57.831]  Just let me know.
[01:48:59.172 --> 01:49:01.495]  I'm not rich and I want it to get to you.
[01:49:02.095 --> 01:49:04.018]  I'm honored you sent this to me.
[01:49:04.438 --> 01:49:08.723]  You've got to understand, sir, the problem here is we try to read all the email.
[01:49:09.224 --> 01:49:10.485]  It's a test 22 again.
[01:49:10.725 --> 01:49:11.806]  We try to read all the email.
[01:49:11.826 --> 01:49:12.748]  We try to read all the letters.
[01:49:13.328 --> 01:49:15.509]  I actually have somebody, when the mail comes in, sit there and read it.
[01:49:15.910 --> 01:49:21.053]  I frankly don't even have the money to pay an employee, because I pay my employees a decent wage, to sit there and read letters.
[01:49:21.413 --> 01:49:22.834]  They try to flag stuff to me.
[01:49:23.274 --> 01:49:26.216]  I don't want to say, don't send mail, because I want the stuff I get sent.
[01:49:26.236 --> 01:49:29.938]  But at the same time, there's no way I can respond to any of it.
[01:49:30.098 --> 01:49:32.760]  I am wallowing in correspondence.
[01:49:33.180 --> 01:49:34.281]  Hundreds of letters a week.
[01:49:34.641 --> 01:49:36.302]  Tens of thousands of emails a week.
[01:49:36.802 --> 01:49:38.003]  Hundreds of faxes a week.
[01:49:38.596 --> 01:49:40.097]  Thousands of phone calls a week.
[01:49:40.577 --> 01:49:47.260]  I mean, I wish some private foundation would come and dow us and I'd get a five-story building and hire people and try to respond to it all.
[01:49:47.480 --> 01:49:48.620]  We just can't do it, folks.
[01:49:48.640 --> 01:49:51.301]  I mean, there's only like five of us in this office.
[01:49:54.843 --> 01:49:58.024]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[01:49:58.364 --> 01:50:00.305]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[01:50:00.685 --> 01:50:08.248]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:50:09.013 --> 01:50:16.080]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:50:16.460 --> 01:50:19.383]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran.
[01:50:19.784 --> 01:50:22.106]  A White House program to disseminate fake news.
[01:50:22.526 --> 01:50:23.367]  NSA spies.
[01:50:23.923 --> 01:50:25.264]  Or by calling toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[01:50:25.284 --> 01:50:27.185]  Or watch it right now online at prisonplanet.tv.
[01:50:51.511 --> 01:50:59.773]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[01:51:00.013 --> 01:51:04.374]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[01:51:04.674 --> 01:51:13.576]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[01:51:13.796 --> 01:51:17.397]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[01:51:17.697 --> 01:51:22.725]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[01:51:23.025 --> 01:51:29.735]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[01:51:30.245 --> 01:51:30.885]  What about you?
[01:51:31.545 --> 01:51:36.887]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[01:52:38.275 --> 01:52:40.196]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:52:59.887 --> 01:53:02.689]  Today is an even better example of this, but listen to these calls.
[01:53:03.610 --> 01:53:04.531]  Megan in Canada.
[01:53:04.731 --> 01:53:05.572]  Paul in Canada.
[01:53:06.232 --> 01:53:08.314]  Andrew in Winnipeg.
[01:53:09.655 --> 01:53:11.037]  Or no, where's Andrew calling from?
[01:53:12.137 --> 01:53:12.578]  Missouri.
[01:53:12.918 --> 01:53:14.199]  Mike in Canada.
[01:53:14.920 --> 01:53:17.062]  I mean, it's Canada, Canada, Canada.
[01:53:18.243 --> 01:53:19.384]  Like I said, great folks up there.
[01:53:19.404 --> 01:53:26.189]  That's why they're worried about you putting a police state right behind your back while you're busy watching the magician's assistant.
[01:53:27.050 --> 01:53:27.851]  The United States.
[01:53:29.284 --> 01:53:31.906]  Oh, yeah, total New World Order up there.
[01:53:33.328 --> 01:53:36.550]  We're going to continue with your calls, and then I'm going to get into the dollar.
[01:53:36.590 --> 01:53:40.914]  I'm going to get into Bush's top ten reasons he needs to be impeached.
[01:53:40.934 --> 01:53:42.295]  I'm going to write an article about it.
[01:53:42.395 --> 01:53:46.599]  Will somebody please give me their ten reasons or a few of the reasons?
[01:53:46.619 --> 01:53:48.661]  I hope the callers will chime in with that.
[01:53:49.021 --> 01:53:51.963]  Before I go to your calls, listen, the season's here.
[01:53:53.585 --> 01:53:54.986]  There's another 11 days.
[01:53:55.226 --> 01:53:55.947]  You can order now.
[01:53:56.770 --> 01:54:00.534]  To be insured you get it by Christmas, we're shipping it out to you UPS ground.
[01:54:02.055 --> 01:54:07.500]  And I may even coming up to the last few days on December 15th, ship it out to you UPS today.
[01:54:07.520 --> 01:54:08.681]  But you won't have to pay for that.
[01:54:09.622 --> 01:54:10.483]  You know, we'll supplement it.
[01:54:10.944 --> 01:54:15.428]  So I want to get it out to you so you get it three or four days at least before Christmas.
[01:54:17.279 --> 01:54:21.302]  Go to Infowars.com on the secure online video and bookstore and do your shopping there.
[01:54:21.742 --> 01:54:27.226]  Get powerful, informative, dynamic, shocking, and frankly entertaining materials.
[01:54:28.147 --> 01:54:33.090]  Terror Storm, America, Freedom to Fascism, all the other books and videos we carry, not just my 15 films.
[01:54:35.242 --> 01:54:37.303]  There is so much there at InfoWars.com.

[01:54:38.544 --> 01:54:40.205]  We've got 20-something specials going.
[01:54:40.265 --> 01:54:41.886]  A bunch of them are just going until Christmas.
[01:54:42.326 --> 01:54:44.768]  Again, that's InfoWars.com or call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[01:54:44.788 --> 01:54:45.628]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:54:45.648 --> 01:54:48.650]  Or you can also write to me, and I'm Alex Jones at 3001.
[01:54:59.188 --> 01:55:08.351]  South Lamar, L-A-M-A-R, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704, and all that's on the website as well.
[01:55:09.071 --> 01:55:20.375]  Or you can go to prisonplanet.tv membership and instantly see all 15 of my films, my weekly TV reports, my in-studio reports, a bunch of other films, over, I don't know, it's a thousand-something pieces of media.
[01:55:20.696 --> 01:55:22.856]  The third year of operations coming up in April.
[01:55:24.117 --> 01:55:24.797]  Prison Planet.
[01:55:25.513 --> 01:55:26.074]  Hey, Alex.
[01:55:53.782 --> 01:55:54.803]  Just two things.
[01:55:54.843 --> 01:55:57.824]  I do have a top ten list for you.
[01:55:59.125 --> 01:56:02.446]  And secondly, you've got to get Michael Moriarty on the show.
[01:56:02.906 --> 01:56:06.748]  He fled the country over his battle with Janet Reno.
[01:56:06.828 --> 01:56:08.068]  He's living in Vancouver.
[01:56:08.088 --> 01:56:16.752]  And I guess he's going to take a stab for running at president in 2008 as a protest against what's happening.
[01:56:16.772 --> 01:56:18.773]  He's totally anti-New World Order.
[01:56:19.728 --> 01:56:27.810]  Great guy, really, really smart, really articulate, very witty, and I think he'd be a really excellent guest for you.
[01:56:28.370 --> 01:56:32.891]  And if you want, I can get you an email or contact information.
[01:56:32.911 --> 01:56:38.972]  I know him personally, and he's just a wonderful fellow.
[01:56:39.693 --> 01:56:41.093]  He was the actor on Law & Order.
[01:56:41.153 --> 01:56:45.474]  He walked away from a million-dollar job over his fight for the First Amendment.
[01:56:46.924 --> 01:56:49.906]  I vaguely remember exactly what happened.
[01:56:50.607 --> 01:56:51.607]  Oh, geez.
[01:56:52.388 --> 01:57:04.238]  Janet Reno called in a meeting with the executives of NBC, and basically she said she wanted to have control over the content of TV.
[01:57:04.438 --> 01:57:04.878]  Oh, yeah.
[01:57:05.219 --> 01:57:07.441]  And Bush is on record having meetings saying that, too.
[01:57:07.461 --> 01:57:09.202]  He had Ashcroft do that.
[01:57:09.743 --> 01:57:10.723]  Yeah, stay there.
[01:57:10.763 --> 01:57:12.565]  Let me get his contact info from you.
[01:57:13.437 --> 01:57:16.598]  And we'll get him on the show, okay?
[01:57:16.898 --> 01:57:18.258]  I'll get that to you.
[01:57:18.338 --> 01:57:25.360]  Now, when you said you wanted a top ten list of impeachment things for Bush, it was just like an avalanche.
[01:57:25.901 --> 01:57:26.521]  Well, stay there.
[01:57:26.561 --> 01:57:29.461]  I'll let you give us some of your ten reasons.
[01:57:29.482 --> 01:57:30.282]  We'll start the third hour.
[01:57:48.064 --> 01:57:48.705]  Big Brother.
[01:57:49.365 --> 01:57:50.406]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:51.146 --> 01:57:52.227]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:52.907 --> 01:57:53.708]  You want answers?
[01:57:54.468 --> 01:57:55.369]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:55.389 --> 01:57:59.732]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:00.232 --> 01:58:04.335]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:11.459 --> 01:58:13.321]  I want to hear your top ten reasons.
[01:58:13.681 --> 01:58:16.503]  You notice no caller has called in on the subject I wanted.
[01:58:17.228 --> 01:58:17.789]  That's fine.
[01:58:18.169 --> 01:58:20.651]  We don't screen your calls, first your name, where you're calling from.
[01:58:21.532 --> 01:58:26.376]  But I would like it if you'd chime in with the top ten reasons to impeach George W. Bush.
[01:58:27.516 --> 01:58:31.360]  Let's go to Megan calling from Canada.
[01:58:32.020 --> 01:58:35.583]  And she wanted to give us some of her reasons to impeach Bush.
[01:58:35.623 --> 01:58:36.063]  Go ahead.
[01:58:37.024 --> 01:58:41.868]  Well, Alex, you ran over so many of them that there was like an avalanche.
[01:58:43.149 --> 01:58:43.389]  You know...
[01:58:45.009 --> 01:58:55.115]  Of reasons, and there were so many that I ended up trying to... I came up with a list of reasons not to impeach Bush, which is sort of a parody.
[01:58:55.135 --> 01:58:57.196]  If I could share that with you.
[01:58:57.596 --> 01:58:59.418]  Oh yeah, we should do one of those too, sure.
[01:58:59.578 --> 01:59:09.524]  Okay, so number one, someone else will have to learn his lines at the Moloch worshipping ceremony at Bohemian Grove.
[01:59:09.544 --> 01:59:09.684]  Okay.
[01:59:13.879 --> 01:59:14.400]  Let's see.
[01:59:14.880 --> 01:59:19.042]  As far as we know, he hasn't done coke off the back of a dead hooker.
[01:59:19.062 --> 01:59:22.683]  That's number two.
[01:59:22.703 --> 01:59:29.206]  Number three, the words presidential knee pads haven't entered into regular political discourse.
[01:59:31.667 --> 01:59:32.347]  Number four?
[01:59:35.203 --> 01:59:36.564]  They're not too racy, are they?
[01:59:36.624 --> 01:59:37.425]  It's a family show.
[01:59:37.445 --> 01:59:38.426]  No, no, no, they're not.
[01:59:38.826 --> 01:59:39.366]  Okay.
[01:59:39.527 --> 01:59:44.991]  He's got his own presidential quasi-military outfit specially suited for him.
[01:59:45.271 --> 01:59:45.491]  Yes.
[01:59:45.511 --> 01:59:51.476]  Do you remember, like, we used to make fun of, like, political leaders who would dress up in funny uniforms?
[01:59:52.117 --> 01:59:55.059]  They'd have to design new quasi-paramilitary outfits, yeah.
[01:59:55.655 --> 01:59:55.935]  Yeah.
[01:59:56.175 --> 02:00:01.178]  Now we've got, like, the President of the United States dressing up in surplus uniform, Durban uniforms.
[02:00:01.398 --> 02:00:03.559]  Like, this is a super banana republic, you know?
[02:00:03.579 --> 02:00:05.320]  Well, what I want people to do is, that's a good idea.
[02:00:05.660 --> 02:00:22.008]  Folks, email them to Aaron at Infowars.com or Watson at PrisonPlanet.com and email your ten reasons to impeach and your ten reasons not to impeach, both satirical or non-satirical, if you worship the great beast.
[02:00:22.688 --> 02:00:23.609]  But go ahead and finish up.
[02:00:24.481 --> 02:00:26.683]  Okay, scariest words spoken in English.
[02:00:27.704 --> 02:00:30.727]  How do you like your coffee, President Dick Cheney?
[02:00:30.747 --> 02:00:36.371]  Yeah, I mean, we need him to keep inventing new words and expanding the English language for us, yes.
[02:00:37.112 --> 02:00:37.612]  Okay.
[02:00:38.834 --> 02:00:47.901]  Oh dear, if we did it, we'd be helping him win his global war on Scrub Rush and Crawford by giving him all that extra time on his hands.
[02:00:48.001 --> 02:00:49.603]  You remember he said, if you're not with us...
[02:00:50.726 --> 02:00:54.389]  Yeah, the photo ops where he wears the cowboy hat, yeah.
[02:00:55.871 --> 02:00:57.011]  And I'm with the scrub brush.
[02:00:58.953 --> 02:01:00.354]  The other stuff was just sort of silly.
[02:01:00.434 --> 02:01:12.825]  Oh, the other thing is really, you know, if this is where I see the impeachment going, if they impeach him, then we're going right back to the Ozark Long March with Field Marshal Rodham.
[02:01:14.667 --> 02:01:16.528]  And she just scares the hell out of me.
[02:01:16.688 --> 02:01:16.949]  I mean...
[02:01:17.689 --> 02:01:19.111]  Yeah, well, she's going to run for president.
[02:01:19.131 --> 02:01:21.793]  Remember she swore a year ago she'd never run?
[02:01:21.814 --> 02:01:24.797]  Well, you should know it's the opposite of whatever she says.
[02:01:25.377 --> 02:01:27.599]  And again, she's pro-war, pro-police state.
[02:01:27.660 --> 02:01:28.140]  They love her.
[02:01:28.761 --> 02:01:33.305]  Yeah, well, don't believe anything until it's... I never believe anything until it's been officially denied.
[02:01:33.325 --> 02:01:36.208]  That's my motto.
[02:01:36.589 --> 02:01:36.989]  Finish up.
[02:01:37.009 --> 02:01:37.670]  We've got about a minute.
[02:01:38.363 --> 02:01:38.723]  Okay.
[02:01:41.004 --> 02:01:43.005]  I guess it would put Jon Stewart out of work.
[02:01:43.245 --> 02:01:44.245]  That's another reason.
[02:01:44.546 --> 02:01:45.306]  Yes.
[02:01:45.746 --> 02:01:48.427]  Dead air on Fox News 24 hours a day.
[02:01:48.447 --> 02:01:51.348]  So that's it.
[02:01:51.788 --> 02:01:55.150]  That's my top ten reasons why Bush should not be impeached.
[02:01:55.650 --> 02:01:59.651]  Well, thank you for now getting serious in the last 30 seconds.
[02:01:59.731 --> 02:02:00.792]  Any reasons to impeach?
[02:02:02.083 --> 02:02:09.728]  Because he's committed, he's destroyed the Bill of Rights and he has wrecked the Constitution.
[02:02:09.748 --> 02:02:15.672]  Yeah, it's like Paul Craig Roberts said that Bush's one victory was destroying the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[02:02:16.373 --> 02:02:16.653]  Yeah.
[02:02:17.293 --> 02:02:18.534]  He will go down in history.
[02:02:18.554 --> 02:02:20.696]  Hey, thank you so much.
[02:02:20.936 --> 02:02:22.677]  I really appreciate you calling in.
[02:02:23.077 --> 02:02:25.399]  And we will contact that Emmy award winning...
[02:02:28.001 --> 02:02:33.989]  I remember hearing about that story, and that was back in the dust of time, back in the mist of time.
[02:02:34.029 --> 02:02:35.991]  We'll definitely check into that.
[02:02:36.031 --> 02:02:36.632]  Thank you so much.
[02:02:46.917 --> 02:02:50.059]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[02:02:50.400 --> 02:02:52.321]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[02:02:52.721 --> 02:03:00.387]  Shockingly classified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:03:01.047 --> 02:03:08.093]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:03:08.513 --> 02:03:11.415]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran.
[02:03:11.835 --> 02:03:14.157]  A White House program to disseminate fake news.
[02:03:14.577 --> 02:03:15.418]  NSA spies.
[02:03:15.956 --> 02:03:17.256]  Or by calling toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[02:03:17.316 --> 02:03:19.217]  Or watch it right now online at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:03:43.789 --> 02:03:44.690]  We're good to go.
[02:03:44.730 --> 02:03:45.410]  We're good to go.
[02:04:04.744 --> 02:04:06.005]  Radioactive poisoning.
[02:04:06.105 --> 02:04:11.989]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[02:04:12.189 --> 02:04:17.273]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[02:04:17.393 --> 02:04:26.259]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[02:04:26.539 --> 02:04:29.702]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5.
[02:04:31.923 --> 02:04:33.525]  By calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[02:04:34.927 --> 02:04:35.128]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:04:43.382 --> 02:04:43.962]  It's a fact.
[02:04:44.162 --> 02:04:48.604]  You can legally eliminate credit card debt, which has been fraudulently created by the banks.
[02:04:48.924 --> 02:04:54.146]  Since its creation in 1913, the Federal Reserve has not been held responsible for its own debt.
[02:04:54.427 --> 02:04:57.628]  So why should you, the hardworking American, be harassed for yours?
[02:04:57.868 --> 02:05:05.011]  There's a double standard when it comes to being responsible for debt, and unlike the Federal Reserve, the people of this country can't print more money when needed.
[02:05:05.351 --> 02:05:12.514]  Day of Jubilee has created a successful program designed for people that want to stop harassing calls and threatening letters from bill collectors.
[02:05:12.774 --> 02:05:14.876]  This is not a debt consolidation company.
[02:05:15.276 --> 02:05:23.761]  Join the thousands of Americans who now breathe a sigh of relief because they have legally eliminated their credit card debt instead of living each day in fear.
[02:05:24.082 --> 02:05:25.643]  It's time to turn your life around.
[02:05:25.983 --> 02:05:27.444]  Call Day of Jubilee.
[02:05:27.644 --> 02:05:28.565]  Open 9 a.m.
[02:05:28.605 --> 02:05:29.425]  to 5 p.m.

[02:05:30.866 --> 02:05:31.186]  That's 920-293-8024.
[02:05:31.246 --> 02:05:31.807]  And ask for Robert.
[02:05:31.827 --> 02:05:33.288]  Don't wait any longer to get your life back in order.
[02:05:48.137 --> 02:05:48.798]  Big Brother.
[02:05:49.458 --> 02:05:50.539]  Mainstream media.
[02:05:51.219 --> 02:05:52.380]  Government cover-ups.
[02:05:52.400 --> 02:05:53.841]  You want answers?
[02:05:54.541 --> 02:05:55.442]  Well, so does he.
[02:05:55.462 --> 02:05:59.804]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:00.304 --> 02:06:04.427]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:06:06.307 --> 02:06:20.338]  Oh yeah, we've got about 51 minutes left, and I promise to go back for more on the dollar, talk about the new film Apocalypto, forgiveness of some of the lies and propaganda we've been witnessing, and talk about Bush's top ten crimes, why he needs to be impeached.
[02:06:22.319 --> 02:06:34.148]  Well, because the lies that took us to war in Iraq, caught red-handed with the White House and Downing Street memos, premeditatedly lying, the yellow cake, all of it, the mobile weapons vans that were hot air balloon trucks,
[02:06:35.923 --> 02:07:04.775]  We, of course, need to do something, need to impeach, because of the Real ID Act giving us a national ID card, federalizing America, the new Freedom Initiative setting up forced psychological testing of all American school children now beginning to be phased in, signing back on the UNESCO treaty to regulate the operations of so much of our federal and state governments, destroying the dollar, having Treasury Secretary Snow openly say they wanted to reduce its value,
[02:07:08.553 --> 02:07:10.714]  There are so many reasons.
[02:07:11.194 --> 02:07:12.775]  One of the big ones is symbolic.
[02:07:13.135 --> 02:07:18.118]  He's a figurehead for what this country's done to the world, being used as a weapon of the New World Order.
[02:07:18.598 --> 02:07:24.201]  So we need to do that as a signal to the world that his actions were not the actions of this country.
[02:07:24.281 --> 02:07:30.544]  So, throw down the... I'm writing these down because I'm going to put this together later.
[02:07:30.964 --> 02:07:32.805]  The figurehead.
[02:07:32.825 --> 02:07:34.746]  I mean, I'm here just thinking of them.
[02:07:34.786 --> 02:07:34.986]  There's...
[02:07:36.195 --> 02:07:37.155]  There's so many.
[02:07:37.295 --> 02:07:39.256]  Pushing for blanket amnesty.
[02:07:40.216 --> 02:07:42.757]  Blanket amnesty.
[02:07:44.218 --> 02:07:47.919]  The North American Union.
[02:07:48.839 --> 02:07:50.000]  American Union.
[02:07:50.840 --> 02:07:52.020]  Literally killing America.
[02:07:52.701 --> 02:07:53.901]  North American Union.
[02:07:53.921 --> 02:07:55.082]  I mean, just how many are there?
[02:07:56.182 --> 02:07:57.202]  Now, I'm going to do this right now.
[02:07:57.222 --> 02:07:59.123]  I've been letting callers on for three, four, five minutes.
[02:07:59.807 --> 02:08:02.048]  And you're always, you're all great callers is the problem.
[02:08:02.328 --> 02:08:03.388]  And I've gotten a lot of you today.
[02:08:03.408 --> 02:08:06.109]  We're doing a good job, but I'm blitzing right now, okay?
[02:08:06.129 --> 02:08:08.130]  Just have your comments and questions ready.
[02:08:08.150 --> 02:08:09.630]  If you're a really good caller, maybe two minutes.
[02:08:10.090 --> 02:08:11.711]  Average caller, you're getting about a minute.
[02:08:12.131 --> 02:08:14.532]  Because I want to give everybody a chance.
[02:08:14.572 --> 02:08:15.412]  And I was about to go to Paul.
[02:08:15.432 --> 02:08:16.072]  He just hung up.
[02:08:16.432 --> 02:08:18.033]  So let's go to Andrew in Missouri.
[02:08:18.073 --> 02:08:18.633]  Go ahead, Andrew.
[02:08:19.233 --> 02:08:24.059]  Yeah, I was just wondering, I hear you mention the Manhattan Project every once in a while.
[02:08:24.619 --> 02:08:26.201]  I'm not familiar with that.
[02:08:26.221 --> 02:08:29.725]  That was the secret program to build an atomic bomb.
[02:08:29.825 --> 02:08:36.313]  And they dropped two different variants, Fat Man and Little Boy, on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
[02:08:37.859 --> 02:08:39.959]  Okay, and what's Northwoods, too?
[02:08:40.059 --> 02:08:41.500]  I hear you mentioning that, too.
[02:08:41.560 --> 02:08:43.200]  Northwoods is the official U.S.
[02:08:43.240 --> 02:08:59.243]  government operation battle plan that was green-lighted all the way up to the president, who said no to launch 9-11-style attacks to bomb D.C., to bomb Miami, to commit sniper attacks coast-to-coast, to hijack jets by remote control and crash them, to attack military bases and kill U.S.
[02:08:59.263 --> 02:09:02.103]  troops, to blame it on foreign enemies, to launch World War III.
[02:09:02.483 --> 02:09:03.223]  And when was this?
[02:09:03.243 --> 02:09:03.223]  1962.
[02:09:04.004 --> 02:09:04.444]  Okay, thank you.
[02:09:07.156 --> 02:09:07.716]  Thank you, sir.
[02:09:07.736 --> 02:09:08.677]  I appreciate your call.
[02:09:09.237 --> 02:09:14.080]  Let's go ahead and talk to Mike in Canada.
[02:09:14.200 --> 02:09:14.560]  Welcome.
[02:09:15.280 --> 02:09:16.721]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[02:09:16.781 --> 02:09:20.883]  I'm Mike Svelte, and I'm a pastor of a small church in Alberta.
[02:09:21.584 --> 02:09:23.505]  I've been listening to your show for some time.
[02:09:23.525 --> 02:09:32.710]  I know you're in a hurry, but the reason that I'm calling is because I've been teaching Bible studies for a while now, and it seems to me that most people
[02:09:33.553 --> 02:10:01.674]  In the quote-unquote Christian world, have this idea from teachings that have been handed down that if we don't support Israel, we're against God, when in fact, God is not a respecter of persons, and we need to stand up for the lives and hopes of anybody, whether they be American, Canadian, Palestinian, Israeli, but it seems like the agenda's been hijacked in order to further, well, like I say, an agenda.
[02:10:03.280 --> 02:10:04.101]  Seems like it.
[02:10:04.441 --> 02:10:06.323]  I meant to talk about this over the weekend.
[02:10:06.363 --> 02:10:06.883]  I printed it.
[02:10:06.923 --> 02:10:08.184]  It's here somewhere in the stack.
[02:10:09.105 --> 02:10:12.508]  And it was an article, I think it was out of Haratz in Israel.
[02:10:12.528 --> 02:10:13.629]  There were several of them I printed.
[02:10:14.109 --> 02:10:17.672]  Where it said, Pastor Hagee down in San Antonio, who's a fiery preacher.
[02:10:18.372 --> 02:10:21.915]  I like a lot of what he has to say, except when he gets into global issues.
[02:10:22.676 --> 02:10:26.219]  And he has set up an open U.S.-Israeli lobby.
[02:10:26.799 --> 02:10:28.981]  His preachers are instructed to not...
[02:10:29.602 --> 02:10:34.445]  ...preach Christianity when they're around Jews, but to just support Israel.
[02:10:34.825 --> 02:10:35.966]  Now, that's blasphemy.
[02:10:36.006 --> 02:10:42.290]  And somebody needs to write an article about that, that the evangelical groups, quote, Jewish groups were worried.
[02:10:42.310 --> 02:10:50.475]  They said, oh, we appreciate your support, because they're getting paid off, you know, saying Israel's God and got to do everything they say, but don't proselytize Jews.
[02:10:50.975 --> 02:10:54.657]  And Hagee and others have said, and it's quoted, where is that?
[02:10:54.677 --> 02:10:55.458]  I've got the story here.
[02:10:56.278 --> 02:10:57.439]  Said, we will not...
[02:10:58.648 --> 02:11:03.132]  I know exactly what you're talking about, Alex, and where Hagee is going with that.
[02:11:03.152 --> 02:11:03.933]  No, no, this is him saying it!
[02:11:03.973 --> 02:11:04.974]  Yeah, I've heard those quotes.
[02:11:20.345 --> 02:11:39.728]  And I know why, because he said that there's a passage in Romans that talks about, so shall all Israel be saved, but you have to go back and... No, no, I was driving down the road and heard him on WOAI like a year ago say, Jews are better than Gentiles, and they are senior Christians with the Lord, and that they're allowed to not accept Jesus.
[02:11:40.088 --> 02:11:40.909]  Folks, I'm not kidding.
[02:11:41.129 --> 02:11:43.349]  And that we must learn from them and do what they say.
[02:11:44.109 --> 02:11:45.289]  It's total blasphemy.
[02:11:45.349 --> 02:11:46.349]  It's total blasphemy.
[02:11:46.369 --> 02:11:47.550]  You've heard that too.
[02:11:50.123 --> 02:11:51.124]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:11:51.184 --> 02:11:56.890]  Out of the mouth of Hagee and Benny Hinnant, a whole lot of these guys, as a matter of fact, because they're pushing the same agenda.
[02:11:56.930 --> 02:12:00.734]  But what you need to do, Alex, is are you familiar with El Campo, Texas?
[02:12:01.995 --> 02:12:03.757]  I know the town.
[02:12:04.297 --> 02:12:06.800]  There's a preacher there named Larry T. Smith.
[02:12:07.652 --> 02:12:36.088]  And he gets really in-depth on a lot of these issues, and in fact, he would be a really good man to have on your show, because he exposes how the Christian agenda has been hijacked by Jewish Talmudic... Well, a lot of the things that Tex Morris talks about, actually, but I find that Larry Smith goes a lot... Well, you know, I've been hearing all this, but then when you actually tune in and Hagee's saying it, and say, I'd forgotten about that until you just mentioned it, and then I'm reading a news article and they're saying the same thing...
[02:12:37.026 --> 02:12:41.890]  I mean, if Christians aren't supposed to go out and proselytize, I don't know what they're supposed to do.
[02:12:42.670 --> 02:12:44.071]  And it's pretty shameful.
[02:12:44.111 --> 02:12:44.952]  I appreciate your call.
[02:12:46.133 --> 02:12:50.396]  Let's go ahead and take another call here.
[02:12:51.217 --> 02:12:53.719]  Let's talk to, who's next here?
[02:12:55.240 --> 02:12:57.842]  Sergeant Major Lee in Florida.
[02:12:57.882 --> 02:12:58.242]  Go ahead.
[02:12:59.096 --> 02:12:59.757]  Yes, sir.
[02:12:59.797 --> 02:13:01.137]  It's great to be on your show.
[02:13:01.298 --> 02:13:02.158]  Good to have you on board.
[02:13:02.198 --> 02:13:02.799]  What's on your mind?
[02:13:03.059 --> 02:13:05.060]  Okay, let's get to the big thing.
[02:13:05.100 --> 02:13:08.823]  You were talking about depleted uranium and all this stuff.
[02:13:09.023 --> 02:13:09.323]  Yes, sir.
[02:13:09.603 --> 02:13:11.565]  Okay, I've got a good one for you.
[02:13:12.866 --> 02:13:23.253]  The military is going to drop nuclear bunker buster bomb against Iran.
[02:13:23.874 --> 02:13:27.735]  Well, they did a year and a half ago order, 200 plus.
[02:13:28.175 --> 02:13:33.757]  They've delivered half of them to Israel, and they are saying that if they strike, it will probably be nuclear.
[02:13:34.497 --> 02:13:35.958]  That's very true.
[02:13:35.978 --> 02:13:42.160]  And that broke six months after we covered it in the New Yorker magazine and then in the New York Times.
[02:13:42.680 --> 02:13:44.981]  Okay, so this is true.
[02:13:45.801 --> 02:13:48.702]  I've got the paperwork in front of me.
[02:13:49.442 --> 02:13:51.623]  Now then, let me tell you about another good one.
[02:13:52.992 --> 02:14:02.055]  I don't know if you know this or not, but would you believe that they've got a big fight going on down in South Carolina?
[02:14:02.075 --> 02:14:04.757]  In Augusta, South Carolina.
[02:14:05.677 --> 02:14:10.779]  They want to build a nuclear plutonium plant there.
[02:14:12.499 --> 02:14:16.441]  I repeat, a nuclear plutonium plant
[02:14:17.784 --> 02:14:27.352]  And for those that don't know, a plutonium plant is a lot more dangerous and a lot easier to put off deadly emissions than a uranium processing facility.
[02:14:27.852 --> 02:14:36.639]  And yeah, they're actually opening old and then talking about building new plants because of a whole new generation of mini-nukes they're going to use they're seeing in conflict.
[02:14:36.739 --> 02:14:42.704]  And the PNAC says they don't want to just legitimize the use of race-specific bio-weapons to kill certain races.
[02:14:42.724 --> 02:14:43.705]  Yeah, that's openly announced.
[02:14:44.585 --> 02:14:47.806]  Total genocidal, you know, mind comp stuff publicly by Dick Cheney.
[02:14:48.067 --> 02:14:54.729]  But yeah, to legitimize the use of, quote, miniature, quote, tactical weapons.
[02:14:55.349 --> 02:14:55.889]  That's correct.
[02:14:55.949 --> 02:15:01.351]  Now, I just got the phone with two senators' office in Washington, D.C.
[02:15:02.312 --> 02:15:05.353]  Domenici and also Senator Graham.
[02:15:06.573 --> 02:15:07.734]  And the phone number is 202-224-6121
[02:15:14.739 --> 02:15:18.002]  And the other phone number is 803-933-0112.
[02:15:18.022 --> 02:15:28.291]  And neither one of these senators' office knows anything about this.
[02:15:30.013 --> 02:15:30.673]  It's rule number one.
[02:15:30.713 --> 02:15:31.574]  They all play dumb.
[02:15:31.894 --> 02:15:35.778]  You call anybody but Ron Paul's office, maybe one or two more.
[02:15:36.528 --> 02:15:47.992]  And they will tell you there's no North American Union, there's no UNESCO, there's no CFR, there was no open, you know, Jane's Weapons Quarterly didn't report they've developed all these many nukes.
[02:15:49.012 --> 02:15:53.273]  You know, they will deny, deny, deny.
[02:15:54.634 --> 02:15:56.694]  I know, I know, I know, I know.
[02:15:57.054 --> 02:15:58.495]  And let me tell you what, right now,
[02:15:59.372 --> 02:16:02.294]  All of our soldiers are coming back from Iraq.
[02:16:02.734 --> 02:16:03.415]  And they're dying?
[02:16:03.935 --> 02:16:06.317]  But again, people don't want to really support them, though.
[02:16:06.697 --> 02:16:09.979]  Supporting them means just cutting them loose and smiling at them.
[02:16:10.379 --> 02:16:10.539]  Right.
[02:16:10.739 --> 02:16:17.684]  And right now, something that's being covered up with all the suicides in Iraq,
[02:16:18.550 --> 02:16:20.671]  That's our soldiers killing each other.
[02:16:20.891 --> 02:16:24.133]  In fact, it came out a few months ago, record suicides for this war.
[02:16:24.153 --> 02:16:24.873]  That's right.
[02:16:24.913 --> 02:16:30.016]  More than doubling any previous war in their per capita number.
[02:16:30.517 --> 02:16:37.100]  Maybe because of the depleted uranium from our bombs, shells, and tank guns.
[02:16:38.321 --> 02:16:39.401]  Well, it's more than that.
[02:16:39.421 --> 02:16:44.084]  A lot of them are waking up while they're there and figuring out it's all lies.
[02:16:45.154 --> 02:16:47.535]  And you know, this is something I can't understand.
[02:16:47.915 --> 02:16:49.955]  I spent three years in Vietnam.
[02:16:51.716 --> 02:16:52.616]  I was a soldier.
[02:16:53.256 --> 02:16:57.137]  My men were soldiers, 17 to 21.
[02:16:57.837 --> 02:16:58.537]  They were men.
[02:16:59.298 --> 02:17:12.801]  What we have now is slaughter, I repeat, slaughter of great soldiers that have been turned into a killing machine, which is very, very wrong.
[02:17:14.733 --> 02:17:17.635]  And I appreciate talking with you, Mr. Jones.
[02:17:17.655 --> 02:17:32.284]  Well, tell you what, stay there, because I want to hear how you gauge that from what you did in Vietnam with the rules of engagement versus vis-a-vis what you're seeing in Iraq and why you come to the conclusion it is slaughter.
[02:17:32.764 --> 02:17:34.305]  Because it is slaughter on both sides.
[02:17:34.926 --> 02:17:36.246]  We'll be right back.
[02:17:36.306 --> 02:17:36.767]  Stay there.
[02:17:37.967 --> 02:17:39.789]  Sergeant Major Lee, and we'll be right back.
[02:17:40.049 --> 02:17:42.030]  Take one more call, and I'm covering news the rest of the show.
[02:17:44.033 --> 02:17:47.935]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt.
[02:17:48.155 --> 02:18:00.440]  But the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999, reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking 10.57% annual increase outpacing its previous 10 years.
[02:18:00.860 --> 02:18:01.260]  The U.S.
[02:18:01.300 --> 02:18:06.882]  economy receives its currency by taking on debt through a private banking institution called the Federal Reserve System.
[02:18:07.282 --> 02:18:09.503]  In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%.
[02:18:11.364 --> 02:18:11.825]  We're good to go.
[02:18:32.188 --> 02:18:32.388]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:18:44.062 --> 02:18:45.903]  Dad, can we stop?
[02:18:46.223 --> 02:18:47.763]  We need to go to the bathroom.
[02:18:48.163 --> 02:18:48.423]  What?
[02:18:48.764 --> 02:18:49.124]  Again?
[02:18:49.544 --> 02:18:51.184]  We just stopped two hours ago.
[02:18:51.244 --> 02:18:55.666]  Honey, let's stop, because I gave the kids their spark-burkey water bottles.
[02:18:55.906 --> 02:18:57.186]  Why did you do that?
[02:18:57.406 --> 02:19:03.208]  Because they can't drink and talk at the same time, and that way we don't have to listen to them singing, Are we there yet?
[02:19:03.508 --> 02:19:04.528]  Are we there yet?
[02:19:04.629 --> 02:19:05.689]  for the entire trip.
[02:19:05.929 --> 02:19:08.150]  Hmm, I didn't think about that.
[02:19:08.630 --> 02:19:09.630]  Great idea.
[02:19:09.650 --> 02:19:12.411]  Yeah, and it's cheap entertainment for the kids.
[02:19:12.870 --> 02:19:15.337]  Bottled water costs around 75 cents a bottle.
[02:19:15.537 --> 02:19:19.929]  And using our Berkey Sport bottles, it costs us less than two and a half cents per refill.
[02:19:20.210 --> 02:19:20.531]  Honey?
[02:19:21.348 --> 02:19:22.589]  You're terrific!
[02:19:22.989 --> 02:19:24.470]  Oh, honey, so are you.
[02:19:24.570 --> 02:19:27.992]  You're the one that bought the family our sport Berkey water bottles.
[02:19:28.272 --> 02:19:29.053]  Now can we stop?
[02:19:29.553 --> 02:19:30.294]  I need to go, too.
[02:19:30.594 --> 02:19:35.037]  Get your Berkey Sport Purification Bottle for only $39 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[02:19:43.823 --> 02:19:46.307]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:19:46.768 --> 02:19:53.940]  Did you know that one of the 45 points of international communism to capture America was to gain control of one or both political parties?
[02:19:54.784 --> 02:19:55.284]  We're good to go.
[02:19:55.304 --> 02:19:55.504]  I think?
[02:20:19.810 --> 02:20:21.311]  Just call our toll-free number, 1-800-516-8736.
[02:20:21.331 --> 02:20:21.911]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[02:20:21.991 --> 02:20:22.311]  Call now.

[02:20:42.799 --> 02:20:47.580]  Times are tough right now, but there are a lot of different ways to get ourselves out of this mess.
[02:20:47.800 --> 02:20:51.781]  Providing for our own food, water, and power are a good start.
[02:20:52.042 --> 02:20:58.343]  As you may have heard by now, Ken's Solar has been configuring alternative energy packages for over a decade.
[02:20:58.583 --> 02:21:02.964]  One of Ken's most popular items right now is the new solar-powered generator.
[02:21:03.165 --> 02:21:08.446]  For a lot less than you'd expect, this portable system can chop up nearly a third of your electric bill.
[02:21:08.726 --> 02:21:14.231]  Getting yourself onto solar power is one of the most liberating things you can do for yourself and your family.
[02:21:14.412 --> 02:21:22.159]  The solar-powered generator will run your lights, fan, electric blanket, your refrigerator, and a whole slew of household items.
[02:21:22.459 --> 02:21:31.128]  Visit Ken's website at Kensolar.com for free downloads, free videos and how-tos, and, of course, the new solar-powered generator.
[02:21:31.508 --> 02:21:34.010]  To all the criminals out there tuned in.
[02:21:34.090 --> 02:21:34.691]  To all the abusers.
[02:21:34.711 --> 02:21:36.032]  To all the control freaks.
[02:21:36.052 --> 02:21:37.093]  This song's for you.
[02:21:37.193 --> 02:21:38.974]  We're taking names.
[02:21:39.075 --> 02:21:40.396]  We're checking them twice.
[02:21:59.651 --> 02:22:01.072]  We know who's been naughty and nice.
[02:22:37.857 --> 02:22:41.278]  Every move you make Every vow you break
[02:23:08.240 --> 02:23:18.226]  Welcome back.
[02:23:20.067 --> 02:23:24.790]  Alright, let's go back to Mr. Lee there in Florida.
[02:23:26.211 --> 02:23:30.814]  You're saying this is slaughter versus what was happening in Vietnam.
[02:23:31.094 --> 02:23:32.415]  How have you come to that conclusion?
[02:23:34.396 --> 02:23:37.678]  In Vietnam, we worked together
[02:23:38.462 --> 02:23:48.448]  As a team at night time was the most important because that's when you were hit most of the time with rockets and everything else.
[02:23:49.729 --> 02:24:05.398]  And here in Iraq the war there is cover bombs that are
[02:24:06.707 --> 02:24:10.888]  Like if I came into your house with a shotgun and just start shooting.
[02:24:13.249 --> 02:24:14.609]  This is a slaughter.
[02:24:14.949 --> 02:24:19.350]  This is what they're doing to our soldiers over in Iraq.
[02:24:19.690 --> 02:24:22.171]  It's an open field of slaughter.
[02:24:22.551 --> 02:24:30.613]  It's like taking a grenade, throwing it in a lake where there's ducks, and you kill a whole bunch of ducks.
[02:24:30.933 --> 02:24:34.174]  Yeah, I mean, it's worse than asymmetrical or guerrilla warfare.
[02:24:35.032 --> 02:24:37.075]  It's just like World War II.
[02:24:37.836 --> 02:24:39.578]  The worst in Korea.
[02:24:39.758 --> 02:24:45.325]  When you go into a village, house-to-house fighting is very bad.
[02:24:45.626 --> 02:24:47.448]  You've got to look out for booby traps.
[02:24:48.695 --> 02:24:49.915]  Individual hiding.
[02:24:50.295 --> 02:24:57.457]  Well, in this case, though, it's not just bombed out cities where you're going in against a nest of a foreign army.
[02:24:57.857 --> 02:25:00.698]  This is just arresting all the males, going into houses.
[02:25:01.658 --> 02:25:05.659]  And this is some of the most grueling psychologically.
[02:25:06.039 --> 02:25:08.980]  But in World War II or Vietnam, you only had to be there one tour.
[02:25:10.060 --> 02:25:14.181]  Now, it's tour after tour after tour after tour of this.
[02:25:14.841 --> 02:25:16.842]  And they're like tires that are bald.
[02:25:16.882 --> 02:25:17.462]  They're blowin'.
[02:25:18.328 --> 02:25:18.808]  Correct, sir.
[02:25:19.128 --> 02:25:20.049]  And let me tell you what.
[02:25:20.189 --> 02:25:21.829]  People don't realize this.
[02:25:22.569 --> 02:25:32.392]  I have talked to young kids at high school with ROTC, and some of the stuff that I explain to them, they look at me.
[02:25:33.152 --> 02:25:35.053]  And I say, okay, here's a CD.
[02:25:36.133 --> 02:25:39.494]  Next time I see you here, tell me I'm wrong or right.
[02:25:39.774 --> 02:25:40.114]  Oh, really?
[02:25:40.154 --> 02:25:41.595]  What are you giving them?
[02:25:41.895 --> 02:25:44.816]  I give them the truth about the war in Iraq.
[02:25:45.256 --> 02:25:46.376]  It's a cover-up.
[02:25:47.082 --> 02:25:49.223]  This is a cover-up war.
[02:25:50.144 --> 02:25:51.384]  We should have never.
[02:25:51.885 --> 02:25:59.369]  Our main point right now should be looking at North Korea, China, and Russia.
[02:26:01.250 --> 02:26:09.375]  Well, I mean, yeah, if you want to talk about real threats, they have capabilities, but they've got to go into Iraq because by shutting off the oil flow, it jacks up the price.
[02:26:09.715 --> 02:26:11.416]  It is about oil in one respect.
[02:26:11.716 --> 02:26:12.457]  Thank you for the call.
[02:26:12.477 --> 02:26:13.157]  I appreciate it.
[02:26:13.948 --> 02:26:16.569]  Let's talk to Ron in Arizona.
[02:26:16.629 --> 02:26:17.329]  Ron, go ahead.
[02:26:17.910 --> 02:26:19.010]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[02:26:20.371 --> 02:26:24.132]  I'd like to give you an idea on how we can take back our country.
[02:26:24.152 --> 02:26:26.493]  Okay.
[02:26:27.113 --> 02:26:42.880]  If everyone or most of your listeners were to pick one or two radio stations where they live, send the station manager, the program manager, an email, a letter,
[02:26:43.656 --> 02:27:02.051]  And a phone call asking him to put you, Alex Jones, on their radio station because you're the only talk show host that they will listen to, and they're not going to listen to any of the talk show hosts on their radio program.
[02:27:02.411 --> 02:27:08.796]  If we had thousands of people all over the country doing that in the local stations, I think eventually...
[02:27:09.341 --> 02:27:11.123]  Some of these stations would put you on.
[02:27:11.343 --> 02:27:12.103]  Well, that's what's happened.
[02:27:12.123 --> 02:27:13.645]  That's why we are getting more affiliates.
[02:27:13.665 --> 02:27:15.727]  I'll tell you what, I'm glad you brought this up.
[02:27:15.767 --> 02:27:24.794]  I was thinking about, in the next segment, briefly talking about this, and I didn't know if I was going to do it, because I don't really usually plug for stations.
[02:27:24.814 --> 02:27:26.876]  I've done it a few other times, and you called in.
[02:27:27.617 --> 02:27:29.238]  So that is definitely a sign.
[02:27:29.298 --> 02:27:30.079]  It's fortuitous.
[02:27:31.100 --> 02:27:32.621]  We'll be right back.
[02:27:33.942 --> 02:27:34.863]  We're on the march.
[02:27:35.323 --> 02:27:36.825]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:37.838 --> 02:27:40.517]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:44.378 --> 02:27:48.359]  I found this company online and they had this really unique variety of salt wellness products.
[02:27:48.579 --> 02:27:52.121]  I read some of the articles and ended up ordering this beautiful salt lamp.
[02:27:52.401 --> 02:27:56.482]  According to the company, they said that the salt crystal lamps gently purify indoor air.
[02:27:56.762 --> 02:27:57.702]  I was so amazed.
[02:27:57.942 --> 02:28:00.783]  I put it in the baby's room and it made a perfect night light.
[02:28:00.963 --> 02:28:02.864]  Both my husband and I could tell the difference.
[02:28:03.244 --> 02:28:08.426]  Soleilwellness.com is a unique company that offers salt wellness products from around the world.
[02:28:08.906 --> 02:28:14.830]  So, I went back to the site and ordered their Soleil Simple Natural Cleaning Products, also made with Himalayan salt.
[02:28:15.090 --> 02:28:16.811]  I figured it would clean really well.
[02:28:17.071 --> 02:28:20.233]  The natural cleaning products worked wonderfully and there was no scent.
[02:28:20.433 --> 02:28:24.336]  This company has so many products my whole family can enjoy and feel better with.
[02:28:24.596 --> 02:28:26.057]  Plus, the service was great.
[02:28:26.417 --> 02:28:31.543]  If you're interested in natural, homeopathic, time-tested remedies, visit SoleilWellness.com.
[02:28:31.583 --> 02:28:34.746]  That's S-O-L-A-Y Wellness.com.

[02:30:19.138 --> 02:30:19.518]  We're good to go.
[02:31:12.777 --> 02:31:15.099]  Crying won't help you.
[02:31:15.859 --> 02:31:17.100]  Praying won't do.
[02:31:17.960 --> 02:31:18.881]  You're no good.
[02:31:20.182 --> 02:31:22.663]  Yeah, I think Bush has committed the ultimate sin.
[02:31:22.703 --> 02:31:26.326]  David Rockefeller and his masters, they have committed the ultimate sins.
[02:31:26.366 --> 02:31:28.807]  They've been given over to complete wickedness.
[02:31:30.268 --> 02:31:32.069]  So to them, crying won't help you.
[02:31:32.669 --> 02:31:33.670]  Praying won't do.
[02:31:33.690 --> 02:31:34.631]  You're no good.
[02:31:35.651 --> 02:31:36.492]  You're going down.
[02:31:39.056 --> 02:31:41.498]  I'm sorry to David and everybody else.
[02:31:42.218 --> 02:31:46.040]  I can't go to your calls because I've got to cover some news I promised to get to and some other key issues.
[02:31:46.980 --> 02:31:48.201]  But let's let Ron finish up.
[02:31:48.921 --> 02:31:53.304]  Ron, you were talking about contacting radio stations and getting them to pick up this transmission.
[02:31:53.824 --> 02:31:57.886]  Yeah, what I'm going to do is I'm going to write a form letter, email it to you.
[02:31:58.066 --> 02:32:04.309]  I would suggest that you put a link on your website to that form letter.
[02:32:04.409 --> 02:32:05.550]  Put it on your website.
[02:32:05.570 --> 02:32:06.890]  I'm just going to email it to you.
[02:32:07.811 --> 02:32:07.931]  And
[02:32:08.724 --> 02:32:20.275]  Have people go there and do something similar, not exactly the same, but write something in their own words saying, I listened to Alex Jones.
[02:32:21.596 --> 02:32:23.118]  I think he's doing a great job.
[02:32:23.598 --> 02:32:27.502]  I don't care for the other talk show hosts on your radio station.
[02:32:27.562 --> 02:32:33.287]  Please consider putting Alex Jones on, or at least one hour of Alex Jones on.
[02:32:34.867 --> 02:32:38.270]  And just if thousands and thousands of people were to do that.
[02:32:38.290 --> 02:32:55.964]  I mean, some of these small radio stations, you've got listeners in areas that could send in a thousand emails and phone calls and letters, and some of these small stations don't even get a thousand emails, letters, or phone calls in ten years.
[02:32:55.984 --> 02:32:58.966]  I hear you, and I appreciate your call.
[02:32:59.007 --> 02:33:02.990]  Let me give everybody some advice and some tidbits on how to do this.
[02:33:05.502 --> 02:33:14.547]  We get a new affiliate probably every month, sometimes more often, but I'd say a month on average.
[02:33:15.348 --> 02:33:27.415]  Some of the years, you know, we get 50-something stations or so picking us up, which sounds like a lot, and we have the biggest Internet audience on Shoutcast, the biggest Internet audience out there for a radio show in the country.
[02:33:27.455 --> 02:33:29.156]  That's by all the different gauges.
[02:33:29.816 --> 02:33:31.437]  And we're on shortwave and satellite.
[02:33:31.457 --> 02:33:32.618]  We have listeners a lot of different ways.
[02:33:33.536 --> 02:33:36.918]  Our podcasting, tens of thousands every day.
[02:33:36.978 --> 02:33:37.638]  Download that.
[02:33:40.320 --> 02:33:47.944]  But don't waste your time on big marquee stations that are owned by CBS, ABC, or Clear Channel.
[02:33:49.565 --> 02:33:56.249]  Because, number one, even if I had a neocon show, they wouldn't pick it up because they have their own shows.
[02:33:56.569 --> 02:33:57.730]  They produce their own shows.
[02:33:57.750 --> 02:34:00.972]  They air their own shows, whether it's locally or whether they pipe it in.
[02:34:03.935 --> 02:34:09.740]  And that's just a free market thing, and it's also about control, so that's why it's an in-house thing.
[02:34:11.301 --> 02:34:18.066]  So you can, number one, find out who owns it, but if it's mom and pop or privately owned, there's still a lot of big, medium, and small stations that do that.
[02:34:19.987 --> 02:34:21.028]  But they've all heard of me.
[02:34:21.068 --> 02:34:22.549]  They've heard me on national shows.
[02:34:22.589 --> 02:34:23.650]  They've heard other talk show hosts.
[02:34:23.690 --> 02:34:27.352]  I mean, Limbaugh's talked about me multiple times, Neil Bortz, Sean Hannity.
[02:34:27.893 --> 02:34:29.314]  I was driving in the car Friday,
[02:34:30.885 --> 02:34:33.547]  And heard Sean Hannity just out of the blue say my name.
[02:34:34.668 --> 02:34:36.030]  I'm so sick of it.
[02:34:36.050 --> 02:34:36.810]  They got called in.
[02:34:36.830 --> 02:34:41.494]  They were having some discussion about, what's her name?
[02:34:41.655 --> 02:34:48.360]  Oh, the pop dancer, the pop singer, Britney Spears.
[02:34:48.981 --> 02:34:50.442]  Kind of proud I have to think of her name.
[02:34:50.462 --> 02:34:51.223]  I don't really follow it.
[02:34:51.920 --> 02:34:52.320]  We're good to go.
[02:34:52.340 --> 02:34:52.820]  We're good to go.
[02:35:12.341 --> 02:35:14.282]  Maybe twice, you know, when I'm driving 10 minutes somewhere.
[02:35:14.322 --> 02:35:16.322]  I was like, how bad must it be?
[02:35:16.342 --> 02:35:17.823]  I get emails all the time.
[02:35:18.363 --> 02:35:23.024]  That was a psychological warfare thing, just to throw my name in at the end of something this reputable.
[02:35:25.445 --> 02:35:28.306]  And so Genesis has an affiliate relations crew.
[02:35:30.046 --> 02:35:31.787]  Every station they talk to knows who I am.
[02:35:34.468 --> 02:35:37.409]  I'll tell you a station we ought to target, and I forget the caller's, it was in Reno.
[02:35:38.369 --> 02:35:40.030]  We were on that thing for about three years.
[02:35:40.130 --> 02:35:41.410]  I've never seen such a response.
[02:35:42.259 --> 02:35:43.740]  I mean, they just loved us in Reno.
[02:35:43.780 --> 02:35:44.660]  Great folks in Nevada.
[02:35:45.801 --> 02:35:50.444]  And then the guy, the station manager, died.
[02:35:51.404 --> 02:35:54.486]  And the new people that came in decided to make it all go music.
[02:35:55.487 --> 02:35:56.688]  Other than Rush Limbaugh.
[02:35:57.608 --> 02:35:59.349]  And I'm told our affiliate relations contacted them.
[02:35:59.369 --> 02:36:00.590]  They said, yeah, we might pick him up.
[02:36:00.610 --> 02:36:02.311]  I mean, there's no reason.
[02:36:02.691 --> 02:36:03.572]  We get the ratings.
[02:36:03.612 --> 02:36:04.492]  We get the audience.
[02:36:04.552 --> 02:36:05.313]  I mean, that's admitted.
[02:36:05.333 --> 02:36:10.636]  You heard George Norrie here saying, we've got one of the biggest audiences in the country.
[02:36:12.003 --> 02:36:12.464]  We're good to go.
[02:36:37.065 --> 02:36:41.609]  You know, we can be on a station that literally doesn't even get a half, during that time slot, of one share.
[02:36:41.989 --> 02:36:43.790]  And in a year, we'll get you a five, six share.
[02:36:44.511 --> 02:36:47.233]  You keep us on two years, we'll get you an eight share in talk radio.
[02:36:47.493 --> 02:36:48.494]  We'll get you a ten share.
[02:36:48.514 --> 02:36:49.615]  We'll get you a fifteen share.
[02:36:53.478 --> 02:36:55.920]  Now, you're not going to get General Motors advertising with you.
[02:36:56.400 --> 02:36:59.623]  You're not going to get IBM advertising, because they're here to kill this country, folks.
[02:37:01.084 --> 02:37:02.145]  All right, I've got to get into news.
[02:37:02.665 --> 02:37:04.987]  The point is, Target, the mom and pops, the privately owned...
[02:37:05.678 --> 02:37:08.059]  And a good way to do it is go, hey, you know MS Communications.
[02:37:08.119 --> 02:37:10.080]  They come up with some of the hottest names in radio.
[02:37:10.481 --> 02:37:11.341]  They see trends.
[02:37:11.361 --> 02:37:13.262]  They own the marquee stations in the country.
[02:37:13.502 --> 02:37:15.043]  That's all they own is jewels.
[02:37:16.644 --> 02:37:18.925]  And all they own in talk radio is award-winning talk.
[02:37:19.305 --> 02:37:20.906]  Well, they wanted to give me a weeknight show.
[02:37:21.206 --> 02:37:22.147]  I said, no, I'm not going to do it.
[02:37:22.167 --> 02:37:23.307]  I can't go do another show.
[02:37:23.928 --> 02:37:25.488]  So I said, let's do a Sunday and syndicate it.
[02:37:25.869 --> 02:37:26.569]  I mean, there it is.
[02:37:26.629 --> 02:37:28.470]  Produced at MS, sent out over Genesis.
[02:37:29.470 --> 02:37:32.192]  KLBJ won all the big radio awards.
[02:37:33.305 --> 02:37:36.846]  This pattern goes from southern Oklahoma all the way down to the coastline of Texas.
[02:37:38.846 --> 02:37:41.267]  One of the strongest stations during the day in Texas.
[02:37:42.507 --> 02:37:43.987]  They just cover five counties at night.
[02:37:44.947 --> 02:37:45.787]  And they came to me.
[02:37:45.807 --> 02:37:56.769]  I remember they had a big, high-powered, one of the top consultants in the country, eight years ago, talk to me and try to get them to pick up the show then, but they didn't.
[02:37:57.550 --> 02:37:58.250]  He worked for them.
[02:37:58.270 --> 02:37:59.630]  He just said, we need Alex Jones.
[02:38:00.914 --> 02:38:03.996]  And by the way, he said back then, Neil Bortz would be the next big thing in the country.
[02:38:04.016 --> 02:38:04.576]  You see he is.
[02:38:04.916 --> 02:38:06.957]  And he said, I would blow away Rush Limbaugh.
[02:38:07.358 --> 02:38:08.818]  I would blow away any of these people.
[02:38:08.938 --> 02:38:09.899]  I will eat their lunch.
[02:38:09.939 --> 02:38:17.243]  If you put me up against anybody on a station that has comparable wattage, I will destroy them.
[02:38:18.384 --> 02:38:20.865]  Because people know bull when they hear it, okay?
[02:38:22.526 --> 02:38:23.086]  They know it.
[02:38:23.266 --> 02:38:24.347]  They know it in their guts.
[02:38:27.492 --> 02:38:34.654]  And frankly, pretty soon, we're not even going to, you know, I mean, if the AM and FM world wants to miss the boat, that's fine.
[02:38:36.755 --> 02:38:45.457]  Exponentially, our web listenership is doubling every year to over 100,000 that tune in just on the web.
[02:38:45.477 --> 02:38:47.257]  That's a small sample, but that's big.
[02:38:47.297 --> 02:38:48.578]  That's bigger than anything else out there.
[02:38:49.178 --> 02:38:51.398]  Because anything that big will charge, and then people can't listen.
[02:38:52.099 --> 02:38:53.259]  You know, Limbaugh and stuff like that.
[02:38:54.725 --> 02:39:01.371]  I mean, over 100, I forget, it was like 125,000 tuned in on a three-hour show, and then 24 hours a day it's running.
[02:39:02.132 --> 02:39:09.638]  You can look at the numbers, it's something like 300 and something thousand tuned in on a 24-hour period, just to my streams and the other streams Genesis offers.
[02:39:12.621 --> 02:39:17.545]  We got, what, like eight different streams, nine different streams, and one of my streams will be number one on Shotcast.
[02:39:18.115 --> 02:39:25.858]  With National Public Radio under it, and Associated Press Radio under it, and USA Radio Network under it, I mean, we're kicking their hind ends in here.
[02:39:27.178 --> 02:39:31.700]  I mean, it's like we start shooting the number one on Google Video, they knock out our numbers over and over again.
[02:39:31.980 --> 02:39:33.840]  They don't want us getting a Super Bowl trophy, folks.
[02:39:33.860 --> 02:39:34.801]  We get cheated out of that.
[02:39:35.181 --> 02:39:38.702]  Because with those signets, with those symbols, we can prove what we've done.
[02:39:40.703 --> 02:39:42.144]  That stuff means something.
[02:39:42.424 --> 02:39:50.650]  You know, we charge up to number eight on the Amazon chart, and then they just, even though they had them in stock, so they weren't in stock for a week and a half to drive out our numbers.
[02:39:52.111 --> 02:39:54.072]  My distributor never before seen something like that.
[02:39:54.873 --> 02:39:55.633]  Talk to them on the phone.
[02:39:55.654 --> 02:39:58.616]  They say, well, we've got them, but we're not putting them in the system yet.
[02:39:59.216 --> 02:40:04.079]  You know, I mean, this is the lengths that they will go to to do this.
[02:40:07.951 --> 02:40:09.853]  So you didn't tune in to hear me talk about myself.
[02:40:09.893 --> 02:40:11.534]  That's what Limbaugh and all of them do.
[02:40:11.654 --> 02:40:17.559]  That's not, but I mean, it's an interesting... That's the catch-22.
[02:40:18.000 --> 02:40:24.365]  I mean, PrisonPlanet.com gets more traffic now than RushLimbaugh.com on the web rating services like Alexa.com and others.
[02:40:25.506 --> 02:40:27.287]  It gets more traffic than Dallas Morning News.
[02:40:29.849 --> 02:40:32.171]  And I can barely pay my bills.
[02:40:33.232 --> 02:40:35.734]  I want to give my people raises and I'm having trouble doing it.
[02:40:40.321 --> 02:40:42.243]  And I'm not very good at making money either.
[02:40:42.483 --> 02:40:45.925]  I don't like having to... I've got all these ad agencies I want to advertise on my websites.
[02:40:46.085 --> 02:40:49.167]  I don't like the stuff that... It's everything on the web.
[02:40:49.247 --> 02:40:50.548]  It's just like... But there's a catch-22.
[02:40:50.568 --> 02:40:51.868]  Do I hire more people?
[02:40:51.888 --> 02:40:52.589]  Do I do a better job?
[02:40:52.629 --> 02:40:53.329]  Make better films?
[02:40:54.070 --> 02:40:54.830]  What do I do here?
[02:40:54.870 --> 02:40:57.312]  I don't even have time to call them up and do the deals with them.
[02:40:59.013 --> 02:41:01.114]  That's how non-focused on money I am.
[02:41:02.225 --> 02:41:08.430]  You know, it's like, so I make 50 cents versus 10 bucks off a DVD sale sold on Amazon.
[02:41:08.590 --> 02:41:09.130]  What do I do?
[02:41:09.150 --> 02:41:10.511]  I say, go there and get it.
[02:41:11.572 --> 02:41:16.696]  It's cheaper there, and blah, blah, blah.
[02:41:16.716 --> 02:41:18.737]  I mean, I'm just here to fight the war, folks.
[02:41:19.978 --> 02:41:23.401]  The only reason I don't want to get killed or die is because I want to stay alive to fight these people.
[02:41:24.821 --> 02:41:28.723]  I mean, I'm so selfless, and really I am, that I don't even care about my own life.
[02:41:28.743 --> 02:41:29.484]  Do you understand that?
[02:41:29.984 --> 02:41:31.345]  And that's quite common in history.
[02:41:31.385 --> 02:41:32.145]  I'm nothing special.
[02:41:32.406 --> 02:41:33.666]  I'm following my programming.
[02:41:34.027 --> 02:41:39.810]  I see a threat to my species, to my family, to my country, and I want to have war with the enemy.
[02:41:43.132 --> 02:41:44.913]  I mean, I want to fight them.
[02:41:45.053 --> 02:41:45.954]  I want to defeat them.
[02:41:46.014 --> 02:41:47.155]  I want to bring them to justice.
[02:41:48.355 --> 02:41:50.997]  And the information war is the most effective way to do it, so that's what I do.
[02:41:53.271 --> 02:41:55.913]  I mean, you know, they took your heroes away from you, folks.
[02:41:55.954 --> 02:42:00.818]  The hero was your grandpa or your grandmother that broke their back to work hard and build this country.
[02:42:01.078 --> 02:42:04.301]  And their grandparents and their grandparents and their grandparents still.
[02:42:05.122 --> 02:42:10.186]  They came across on leaky wooden boats and storms and so many of them went to the bottom of the Atlantic.
[02:42:11.627 --> 02:42:15.531]  You know, the heroes are not some basketball player or some movie star.
[02:42:17.140 --> 02:42:18.861]  And, you know, they tell you, only care about yourself.
[02:42:19.821 --> 02:42:21.201]  Don't care what's going on in the world.
[02:42:21.321 --> 02:42:23.902]  I mean, you know, it's bizarre.
[02:42:24.402 --> 02:42:27.403]  It's unheard of for somebody to be selfless and to care about others.
[02:42:29.304 --> 02:42:31.364]  But I'm tuned in to what it is to be a human being.
[02:42:33.765 --> 02:42:34.825]  I mean, I'm on a mission.
[02:42:34.905 --> 02:42:36.546]  I'm fulfilled.
[02:42:36.646 --> 02:42:38.106]  My life is filled with passion.
[02:42:39.387 --> 02:42:40.147]  It's an adventure.
[02:42:44.421 --> 02:42:48.303]  But it's not just mindless, empty, thrill-seeking like climbing Mount Everest.
[02:42:49.083 --> 02:42:57.147]  It is assailing a dehumanizing force that is engaged in crimes so black I don't even have words to describe it.
[02:43:01.048 --> 02:43:04.290]  Alright, I said what are the top ten things that Bush has done?
[02:43:06.130 --> 02:43:08.812]  North American Union killing the sovereignty of this country.
[02:43:09.072 --> 02:43:09.712]  Unprecedented.
[02:43:12.003 --> 02:43:17.385]  Trying to pass and pushing blanket total amnesty for all illegal aliens in the guest worker program.
[02:43:20.827 --> 02:43:27.509]  We need to throw down the figurehead by impeaching him and show the world that this is not our leader, even though he is a titular head in a puppet.
[02:43:27.790 --> 02:43:31.011]  That's a symbol of, hey, the American people do not buy into this.
[02:43:32.662 --> 02:43:42.026]  We need to impeach him so that the figurehead's gone, that Democrats keep blaming for everything, so we can start impeaching Pelosi and others for the stuff they've already been doing, and what they will do in the next session of Congress.
[02:43:43.526 --> 02:43:49.568]  And we need to impeach all of them that voted for the Military Commissions Act, the Patriot Act, all of it.
[02:43:51.709 --> 02:43:57.151]  The UNESCO Treaty and all the other UN treaties Bush has signed on to, his destruction of the dollar, did I mention that?
[02:43:57.991 --> 02:44:01.933]  The New Freedom Initiative before psychological testing and drugging, the Real ID Act,
[02:44:02.896 --> 02:44:10.219]  The lies that led us to war, the Downing Street memos, the yellow cake uranium, the weapons trucks, the buying fake news.
[02:44:13.541 --> 02:44:14.181]  That's another one.
[02:44:14.401 --> 02:44:15.362]  Buying fake news.
[02:44:15.522 --> 02:44:19.964]  Billions, every purchase of a reporter or a news story or a fake newscast.
[02:44:20.044 --> 02:44:20.904]  Total felonies.
[02:44:21.584 --> 02:44:25.626]  General accounting office, governmental accounting office, they've both said totally illegal.
[02:44:27.607 --> 02:44:30.649]  The omnibudsman of the Congress, who was a Republican, said it was illegal.
[02:44:30.669 --> 02:44:31.509]  I mean, just on its face.
[02:44:32.936 --> 02:44:35.898]  Having the Pentagon engage in domestic propaganda?
[02:44:39.401 --> 02:44:43.344]  Those are all reasons to impeach.
[02:44:44.865 --> 02:44:45.466]  All reasons.
[02:44:50.410 --> 02:44:51.090]  It's unbelievable.
[02:44:54.253 --> 02:44:57.755]  So, I don't even know what to say anymore.
[02:44:58.956 --> 02:44:59.857]  There's a bunch of other ones.
[02:45:01.443 --> 02:45:03.944]  And you talk about an unruly group of motley crew.
[02:45:04.744 --> 02:45:06.785]  Only one caller called in with my impeachment question.
[02:45:07.165 --> 02:45:07.685]  But that's fine.
[02:45:07.725 --> 02:45:13.027]  I take the call because you bring us different parts of the spin the wheel or something here.
[02:45:14.847 --> 02:45:16.328]  Okay, what's happening with the dollar?
[02:45:17.528 --> 02:45:22.550]  They are plunging the dollar so foreign corporations and countries can buy up U.S.
[02:45:22.670 --> 02:45:29.592]  assets from ports to roads to national parks being ceded to real estate, gold, mines.
[02:45:30.763 --> 02:45:39.030]  Infrastructure, construction, and that's mirrored here in the news in the USA Today.
[02:45:39.050 --> 02:45:42.553]  Our view, national fiscal security, look at who owns U.S.
[02:45:42.613 --> 02:45:43.113]  debt now.
[02:45:43.213 --> 02:45:50.239]  Not just having currencies that are worth more, so it's like an American going to Mexico with a pesos loan, being able to get dinner for $2 or $1.
[02:45:53.280 --> 02:45:58.522]  It's also that 52 plus percent of our debt is held now by foreign countries.
[02:45:58.562 --> 02:46:01.183]  You add in foreign corporations, it's in the mid-70s.
[02:46:01.243 --> 02:46:02.804]  It could be even higher.
[02:46:02.824 --> 02:46:05.265]  That's USA Today today.
[02:46:08.626 --> 02:46:14.388]  It also allows OPEC to get more in its petrodollars, and that's here in Bloomberg Financial today.
[02:46:14.448 --> 02:46:16.729]  OPEC may see higher oil prices on weaker dollar.
[02:46:18.729 --> 02:46:22.131]  The Chinese yuan hits new high versus the dollar.
[02:46:22.611 --> 02:46:23.231]  That's AP.
[02:46:23.251 --> 02:46:31.415]  They've broken their deal to keep it pegged to the dollar, and they're moving now rapidly away to a basket of currencies, which they started doing a year ago.
[02:46:31.435 --> 02:46:34.817]  They own over a trillion in our reserves.
[02:46:37.853 --> 02:46:42.114]  There's a Times of London article about profiting from tumbling dollar.
[02:46:42.154 --> 02:46:42.694]  It's real fun.
[02:46:43.114 --> 02:47:03.100]  It's another thing the globalists do is while they jack it up and drop it and jack it up, it goes up and down, but the trend overall in the five-year, six-year chart is straight down because the big banks control the central government, so they know when it's going to go up and down by manipulations, so they all make huge profits on top of it by writing it down.
[02:47:03.553 --> 02:47:04.356]  We're good to go.
[02:47:11.278 --> 02:47:30.823]  And while they bring us in this process of the European Union's Euro, the Amero, which they're now announcing on MSNBC as the answer to that, then they'll play those two off against each other and against the Asian Union, causing more spikes and plunges, then calling for a world set number by the IMF and World Bank and the UN.
[02:47:30.843 --> 02:47:35.345]  You'll still have all these currencies, but they'll all be worth the same thing.
[02:47:35.625 --> 02:47:40.566]  That'll give them global currency manipulation hegemon, or total monopoly,
[02:47:42.191 --> 02:48:01.404]  And they do these booms and busts centrifugally, and I guess it's centrifugal way, in a centrifugal way, to always, in rapid waves, consolidate wealth in pure and pure hands, because you had a huge middle class in this country that had about 40% of the world's wealth,
[02:48:02.954 --> 02:48:06.875]  And about 10% of the elite having the other wealth, so the country had half the world's wealth.
[02:48:06.935 --> 02:48:16.977]  Now the middle class has got about 22% of the world's wealth, and the elite has consolidated the other world wealth and that other 30% or so.
[02:48:18.277 --> 02:48:19.397]  So that's happening there.
[02:48:19.417 --> 02:48:23.018]  I want to go over some propaganda and other issues.
[02:48:23.618 --> 02:48:24.958]  I wanted to talk about Apocalypto.
[02:48:27.338 --> 02:48:28.279]  Maybe I'll do that tomorrow.
[02:48:29.659 --> 02:48:29.839]  But...
[02:48:31.941 --> 02:48:32.761]  So much I want to talk about.
[02:48:32.781 --> 02:48:33.702]  We're out of time again.
[02:48:34.222 --> 02:48:34.602]  Stay with us.
[02:48:34.842 --> 02:48:35.542]  Final segment.
[02:48:35.823 --> 02:48:38.083]  Infowars.com, prismhunter.com, the websites.
[02:48:38.504 --> 02:48:40.404]  Do your Christmas shopping at infowars.com.
[02:48:40.424 --> 02:48:40.864]  Support us.
[02:48:47.107 --> 02:48:47.587]  It's here.
[02:48:47.787 --> 02:48:52.569]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[02:48:52.929 --> 02:49:00.552]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:49:01.269 --> 02:49:08.314]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:49:08.714 --> 02:49:20.141]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iraq, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:49:20.461 --> 02:49:24.384]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:49:24.404 --> 02:49:26.345]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:49:26.685 --> 02:49:30.528]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:49:44.033 --> 02:49:44.794]  Terrorism.
[02:49:44.954 --> 02:49:45.694]  Terrorism.
[02:49:45.814 --> 02:49:46.655]  Chemical attacks.
[02:49:46.715 --> 02:49:47.375]  Dirty bombs.
[02:49:47.475 --> 02:49:47.896]  Fallout.
[02:49:47.976 --> 02:49:48.977]  Biological attack.
[02:49:49.157 --> 02:49:49.677]  And threats.
[02:49:49.757 --> 02:49:51.879]  And to top it all off, duct tape and plastic.
[02:49:52.139 --> 02:49:53.720]  Alarming words for our time.
[02:49:53.980 --> 02:49:56.442]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[02:49:56.842 --> 02:50:11.412]  The video, Sheltering in Place, Surviving Acts of Terrorism from Biological, Chemical, and Radioactive Fallout, was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[02:50:11.452 --> 02:50:11.773]  government.
[02:50:11.933 --> 02:50:13.734]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[02:50:14.094 --> 02:50:20.018]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[02:50:20.138 --> 02:50:24.641]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video sheltering in place.
[02:50:24.901 --> 02:50:31.625]  Get the critical information you need now for only $29 plus shipping by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[02:50:31.685 --> 02:50:34.327]  That's 888-803-4438 or order on the web at murkywater.com.
[02:50:43.579 --> 02:50:51.521]  For years you've been hearing about Herbal Healer Academy and how it's remained the leader in effective alternative and natural medicine and education.
[02:50:51.982 --> 02:50:55.163]  But how can they continue to hold that title for years on end?
[02:50:55.523 --> 02:50:58.564]  The answer is high quality and huge selection.
[02:50:58.964 --> 02:51:03.765]  Just visit HerbalHealer.com and shop online or request a free catalog.
[02:51:04.205 --> 02:51:06.546]  You're bound to find the alternative you're looking for.
[02:51:07.296 --> 02:51:11.957]  Did you know that Herbal Healer carries the latest, safest and effective weight loss products?
[02:51:12.477 --> 02:51:18.359]  You can also count on Herbal Healer for the largest selection of safe and natural supplements just for children.
[02:51:18.679 --> 02:51:19.799]  And don't forget your pets.
[02:51:20.279 --> 02:51:25.941]  Herbal Healer even has natural mineral supplements for all your animals, including horses, cows and birds.
[02:51:26.417 --> 02:51:27.318]  We're good to go.
[02:51:57.145 --> 02:52:11.794]  People on talk radio, people in local newsrooms, they feel real good when they get money together for calling cards or Crayola drawings by kids that are sent to the troops.
[02:52:14.856 --> 02:52:19.319]  And to them, as long as they mindlessly think they're supporting the troops...
[02:52:22.089 --> 02:52:23.590]  They feel good about themselves.
[02:52:23.710 --> 02:52:25.651]  And evil gets power off of that.
[02:52:25.671 --> 02:52:27.092]  It gets a shell of goodness.
[02:52:28.012 --> 02:52:31.434]  Because something evil is happening in the world to the Iraqis, to our own troops.
[02:52:32.375 --> 02:52:35.456]  But then you've got this shell of people who aren't really bad.
[02:52:35.516 --> 02:52:37.918]  They're just ignorant, empowering evil.
[02:52:37.938 --> 02:52:44.401]  Let me tell you, a lot of Nazis, a lot of people that fought in Hitler's military thought they were fighting for Germany, folks.
[02:52:44.902 --> 02:52:46.222]  They really believed in it to the end.
[02:52:46.242 --> 02:52:47.403]  They didn't understand it.
[02:52:49.639 --> 02:52:55.781]  I mean, if you really supported the troops, you would support them not using DU, which ends up killing our troops.
[02:52:58.302 --> 02:53:06.385]  I mean, I've been out at Crawford when the pro-troop people are out there, and I go, well, hey, when people's arms and legs get blown off, they have to pay for their own flight back, and they didn't deny it.
[02:53:06.765 --> 02:53:07.346]  I got it on tape.
[02:53:07.366 --> 02:53:10.087]  They'll say, well, yeah, I know, but we don't have the money.
[02:53:11.727 --> 02:53:12.808]  They've got the money.
[02:53:12.848 --> 02:53:15.809]  I mean, $3 billion for different types of bombers and stuff?
[02:53:17.475 --> 02:53:19.396]  I mean, don't you know about the VA corruption?
[02:53:19.436 --> 02:53:20.157]  Go help there.
[02:53:20.497 --> 02:53:21.198]  No, they don't.
[02:53:22.659 --> 02:53:26.281]  It's a religious thing of just feeling good.
[02:53:28.903 --> 02:53:30.684]  And saying we're over there fighting Al-Qaeda.
[02:53:30.724 --> 02:53:35.948]  I mean, we ought to all be ashamed of what the troops have done and what we've been part of and what they've done to the Iraqis.
[02:53:35.988 --> 02:53:37.789]  I mean, 2.15 million dead in the last 16 years.
[02:53:37.809 --> 02:53:39.951]  654,000 in the last three and a half years.
[02:53:45.424 --> 02:53:46.585]  I mean, that's British Medical Journal.
[02:53:46.605 --> 02:53:47.525]  That's Lancet, folks.
[02:53:47.866 --> 02:53:51.248]  They are very respected, very conservative, and they go into war zones.
[02:53:51.268 --> 02:53:52.569]  This is not some liberal group.
[02:53:53.289 --> 02:53:55.751]  This is for the government of England.
[02:53:55.771 --> 02:53:56.752]  They go and get these numbers.
[02:53:58.293 --> 02:53:59.874]  And they said that's the low side.
[02:54:00.194 --> 02:54:00.975]  It could be as high as 900,000.
[02:54:02.476 --> 02:54:09.681]  And that's a cross-study cluster survey done of tens of thousands countrywide.
[02:54:11.235 --> 02:54:13.496]  You can go just type in Landsat Study on Iraq Dead.
[02:54:13.516 --> 02:54:14.056]  It'll pop up.
[02:54:14.096 --> 02:54:14.556]  It's lengthy.
[02:54:14.796 --> 02:54:15.237]  Go read it.
[02:54:15.297 --> 02:54:15.577]  I did.
[02:54:15.857 --> 02:54:16.597]  I read the whole thing.
[02:54:23.560 --> 02:54:25.641]  And, you know, there's so many other examples.
[02:54:25.861 --> 02:54:29.162]  I mean, I was listening to another national talk show, and they were saying, it's not about oil.
[02:54:29.202 --> 02:54:30.283]  That's oil's flowing out.
[02:54:30.323 --> 02:54:31.363]  We could have oil coming out.
[02:54:32.123 --> 02:54:33.364]  Saddam would sell us all we wanted.
[02:54:34.455 --> 02:54:35.776]  That was the problem.
[02:54:35.796 --> 02:54:38.037]  They were mad at him in 1990 for selling too much oil.
[02:54:38.077 --> 02:54:39.138]  Go back and pull the articles.
[02:54:39.558 --> 02:54:41.939]  He was over-pumping, driving down prices.
[02:54:42.680 --> 02:54:44.401]  They went in to shut that oil off.
[02:54:45.321 --> 02:54:47.483]  Artificial scarcity, just like with the diamonds.
[02:54:48.103 --> 02:54:52.345]  Diamonds are really semi-precious, but one company has an almost total monopoly.
[02:54:54.747 --> 02:54:56.948]  And so, they artificially increased the price.
[02:54:58.789 --> 02:54:59.649]  I mean, listen.
[02:55:00.150 --> 02:55:03.932]  There's nothing more frustrating for me to know you're being conned, to know you're being lied to,
[02:55:05.032 --> 02:55:17.002]  So many of you, and to see you laugh at me or say I'm a traitor and not know I'm your friend, the people that are getting rid of our borders and getting rid of our sovereignty and getting rid of our country are the same ones that are for the war.
[02:55:17.422 --> 02:55:18.183]  Hillary's for the war.
[02:55:18.263 --> 02:55:19.344]  She's for North American Union.
[02:55:19.824 --> 02:55:20.625]  Bush is for the war.
[02:55:20.765 --> 02:55:21.806]  He's for North American Union.
[02:55:24.588 --> 02:55:25.309]  You understand that?
[02:55:26.069 --> 02:55:26.830]  She's for amnesty.
[02:55:26.850 --> 02:55:27.571]  He's for amnesty.
[02:55:27.651 --> 02:55:28.992]  It's the same group.
[02:55:30.089 --> 02:55:30.969]  Don't you understand?
[02:55:30.989 --> 02:55:34.951]  This has meant we built the empire for the global banks and America takes the blame.
[02:55:35.251 --> 02:55:37.871]  Please, if you love this country, listen to me.
[02:55:39.092 --> 02:55:39.992]  I'm your friend.
[02:55:42.293 --> 02:55:43.413]  I'm walking point here.
[02:55:44.713 --> 02:55:45.874]  Putting it all on the line.
[02:55:46.514 --> 02:55:48.155]  I believe we can beat them with God's help.
[02:55:49.335 --> 02:55:51.996]  Now get over to InfoWars.com and get Terror Storm.
[02:55:52.036 --> 02:55:53.296]  Get America Freedom of Fascism.
[02:55:53.676 --> 02:55:54.016]  Get them.
[02:55:54.056 --> 02:55:54.656]  Make copies.
[02:55:54.676 --> 02:55:55.597]  Get them out to everybody.
[02:55:55.917 --> 02:55:56.437]  Don't wait.
[02:55:56.597 --> 02:55:57.677]  Join the InfoWar.
[02:55:58.037 --> 02:55:59.558]  Don't wait for orders from headquarters.
[02:56:00.442 --> 02:56:01.703]  Go to the Sound of the Guns.
[02:56:03.084 --> 02:56:04.465]  Join us in the Info War.
