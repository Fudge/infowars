[00:00:05.806 --> 00:00:06.468]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.129 --> 00:00:08.212]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.893 --> 00:00:09.996]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.677 --> 00:00:11.419]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.216 --> 00:00:13.096]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.116 --> 00:00:17.418]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.978 --> 00:00:22.100]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:35.045]  Well, I've been chomping at the bit all weekend long to get in here in studio, and now I'm here.
[00:00:36.377 --> 00:00:36.997]  We're good to go.
[00:00:57.088 --> 00:01:10.350]  We've got Webster Tarbley, who's an amazing political researcher, especially when you talk about government-sponsored terror and the British oligarchy that is the predominant, penultimate power in the world today.
[00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:14.751]  He will be joining us in the second and third hours of his schedule.
[00:01:16.151 --> 00:01:18.072]  In the meantime, of course, we'll have open phones.
[00:01:19.292 --> 00:01:22.193]  Police faked tube death log.
[00:01:22.253 --> 00:01:24.393]  Remember the Demendez individual?
[00:01:26.303 --> 00:01:28.464]  Who was killed execution style?
[00:01:28.484 --> 00:01:30.825]  Well, no style about it.
[00:01:30.845 --> 00:01:32.526]  It was an execution premeditated.
[00:01:32.566 --> 00:01:34.926]  We can guess why, what we think we know.
[00:01:34.987 --> 00:01:37.047]  But we know they killed him on purpose, by design.
[00:01:37.508 --> 00:01:38.748]  Turns out the logs were faked.
[00:01:38.788 --> 00:01:39.828]  Of course they were faked.
[00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:51.413]  So I want to spend some time on this, because it's just one more example, one more thimble out of this oceanic vastness of lies.
[00:01:51.753 --> 00:01:52.674]  Everything is a lie.
[00:01:52.714 --> 00:01:55.155]  I mean, folks, I counted them up this morning.
[00:01:56.886 --> 00:02:13.300]  There are 11 different stories from this weekend and today, Monday, of our government paying for fake newscasts, propagandizing the American people, planting false news stories, lying.
[00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.683]  And frankly, in three hours, I couldn't cover all 11 properly.
[00:02:19.264 --> 00:02:24.709]  There are multiple examples of governments premeditatedly lying, and then they never get in trouble.
[00:02:25.805 --> 00:02:27.527]  And then we're supposed to just trust these people.
[00:02:28.969 --> 00:02:30.210]  That's my frustration here.
[00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:30.911]  But you know what?
[00:02:30.971 --> 00:02:46.629]  I've recommitted not to what I call overheat here on the air because I listened to a rebroadcast this weekend and for part of the show, part of the broadcast, I mean it was still listenable and interesting, but I was jabbering, gibbering like a monkey.
[00:02:47.664 --> 00:02:58.729]  Because I get in here and I try to detail each little area, and then I don't cover a bunch of news I wanted to get to, and then it just doesn't, at the end of the day... The problem is, I want to cover it all.
[00:02:59.289 --> 00:03:02.050]  And I want to detail just how dastardly it is.
[00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:09.533]  I mean, the thing we're facing, this world government we're facing, is so evil, and so big, and so out in the open...
[00:03:10.382 --> 00:03:12.403]  That it just blows my mind.
[00:03:12.443 --> 00:03:13.623]  But just, here's some of the news.
[00:03:13.643 --> 00:03:17.744]  Obviously, here's some of the news that I can't even read one headline without getting into details on it.
[00:03:18.804 --> 00:03:20.964]  Police faked tube death log.
[00:03:21.385 --> 00:03:22.005]  Here's another one.
[00:03:22.085 --> 00:03:24.425]  Iran warns of missile strike on the U.S.
[00:03:24.465 --> 00:03:24.945]  and Israel.
[00:03:25.706 --> 00:03:28.066]  ExxonMobil sees record profit for U.S.
[00:03:28.646 --> 00:03:29.726]  company division.
[00:03:30.227 --> 00:03:31.227]  Same thing with Chevron.
[00:03:31.267 --> 00:03:31.847]  Same headline.
[00:03:32.427 --> 00:03:34.548]  Murtha says Iraq is now a civil war.
[00:03:34.568 --> 00:03:36.108]  It was always designed to be that, Murtha.
[00:03:36.833 --> 00:03:45.440]  ABC News anchor Bob Woodruff, who I've met before, interesting fella, and cameraman injured pretty badly over in Iraq because it is such a civil war.
[00:03:45.961 --> 00:03:46.761]  It's bedlam.
[00:03:47.662 --> 00:03:49.243]  Gunman storm Palestinian parliament.
[00:03:49.283 --> 00:03:52.666]  I'm sure you've heard about this five million times over the weekend, but I've got my own take on it.
[00:03:53.047 --> 00:03:57.891]  Neocon mouthpieces still clinging to Osama bin Laden link to Iraq.
[00:03:58.651 --> 00:03:59.432]  And U.S.
[00:03:59.492 --> 00:04:01.994]  plans to fight the net revealed.
[00:04:02.314 --> 00:04:05.457]  This is just one of the 11 I've chosen to cover today.
[00:04:06.644 --> 00:04:19.669]  This is the BBC, and it says the Pentagon is going to be attacking our websites, and it's going to plant even more false news, and even more provocateurs, paid on the web, trying to turn patriots and freedom folks against each other.
[00:04:19.689 --> 00:04:21.729]  And I can sit here and name who these people are right now.
[00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:22.970]  We already know who a bunch of them are.
[00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:25.331]  I never really spent a lot of time on there.
[00:04:25.351 --> 00:04:28.852]  I've even hired PIs a few times to confirm my suspicions, and I just move on.
[00:04:29.908 --> 00:04:31.329]  Just here it is, folks.
[00:04:31.549 --> 00:04:31.689]  U.S.
[00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:33.989]  plans to fight the net revealed.
[00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:35.370]  We already know their plans.
[00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:39.851]  See, nothing the globalists do is secret because it's all manifest on the ground level.
[00:04:40.852 --> 00:04:45.473]  I know what goes on in the war rooms of the New World Order because I can see their program right out in front of me.
[00:04:48.514 --> 00:04:49.775]  I mean, it's just... Here's another one.
[00:04:51.315 --> 00:04:52.956]  Stage White House photos.
[00:04:53.016 --> 00:04:56.377]  It's just all... You see, I said I'd cover one.
[00:04:56.417 --> 00:04:57.457]  I was already covering two.
[00:04:57.858 --> 00:04:58.618]  We'll be right back.
[00:04:58.638 --> 00:04:58.998]  Stay with us.
[00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:09.692]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[00:05:09.973 --> 00:05:14.714]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[00:05:14.934 --> 00:05:20.576]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[00:05:20.836 --> 00:05:25.357]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[00:05:25.577 --> 00:05:32.719]  The casual society control grid, implantable microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[00:05:32.739 --> 00:05:37.280]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:39.940]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:46.882]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.
[00:05:47.122 --> 00:05:52.389]  Order online now at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling 1-888-253-3139.
[00:05:52.409 --> 00:05:52.829]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:06:01.391 --> 00:06:04.873]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[00:06:05.133 --> 00:06:08.634]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[00:06:08.714 --> 00:06:12.656]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[00:06:12.896 --> 00:06:19.039]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:06:19.459 --> 00:06:27.363]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[00:06:27.763 --> 00:06:33.127]  Black Berkey filter elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[00:06:33.287 --> 00:06:37.049]  Yet the Black Berkey filter elements leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:06:37.409 --> 00:06:39.271]  And the Black Berkey filters are reclaimable.
[00:06:39.331 --> 00:06:41.512]  Simply brush them up with Scotch-Brite pads.
[00:06:41.732 --> 00:06:46.675]  Normally $48 each, you get a two-pack for only $91 or a four-pack for only $173.
[00:06:46.715 --> 00:06:52.279]  Get the powerful Black Berkey replacement filters now by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:06:55.661 --> 00:06:59.504]  That's 888-803-4438 and protect your family.
[00:07:00.304 --> 00:07:01.785]  Hey folks, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:07:02.125 --> 00:07:06.088]  You've all heard me on the radio talking about the importance of investing in precious metals.
[00:07:06.468 --> 00:07:09.991]  I feel it's time for me to talk about the importance of investing in your health.
[00:07:10.351 --> 00:07:13.913]  I was presented with the opportunity to try TriVibes from TriVortex.
[00:07:14.314 --> 00:07:19.177]  I was a bit hesitant of the idea of absorbing vitamins by wearing them rather than ingesting them,
[00:07:19.497 --> 00:07:25.282]  After conducting one of the tests found at TriVortex.com, I was convinced that the product might actually work.
[00:07:25.602 --> 00:07:31.747]  I now wear my TriVibes bands daily, and I'm feeling better than ever, not only physically, but also mentally.
[00:07:32.067 --> 00:07:37.852]  TriVortex also offers amazingly beneficial and beautiful jewelry worn by the women around the office daily.
[00:07:38.272 --> 00:07:39.453]  TriVortex is amazing.
[00:07:39.774 --> 00:07:40.895]  Don't take my word for it.
[00:07:40.975 --> 00:07:46.401]  Try TriVortex yourself and have fun and learn with the test found on TriVortex.com.
[00:07:46.601 --> 00:07:50.064]  That's T-R-I-V-O-R-T-E-X dot com.
[00:07:50.345 --> 00:07:51.646]  Or call my friend Brian at 619-884-1455.
[00:07:51.686 --> 00:07:51.966]  That's 619-884-1455.
[00:08:02.654 --> 00:08:08.698]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:09.298 --> 00:08:12.340]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.103 --> 00:08:21.105]  All right, I want to spend some time today on a key facet.
[00:08:23.647 --> 00:08:29.991]  Going on worldwide, but especially in the Western world, of the police state, and that is fake newscast.
[00:08:30.451 --> 00:08:32.753]  Pentagon-planted news stories.
[00:08:33.533 --> 00:08:42.579]  I mean, the general public thinks there's a conservative bias or there's a liberal bias, and the establishment would love for the average person to just stay in that paradigm.
[00:08:43.806 --> 00:08:44.307]  It must be true.
[00:08:54.457 --> 00:08:55.037]  We're good to go.
[00:08:55.077 --> 00:08:55.618]  We're good to go.
[00:09:20.015 --> 00:09:23.278]  We are wedded to the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[00:09:23.298 --> 00:09:24.599]  I love America.
[00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:27.061]  I love Americana.
[00:09:28.269 --> 00:09:30.050]  I don't like secret police squads.
[00:09:30.210 --> 00:09:32.010]  I don't like FEMA camps being built.
[00:09:32.390 --> 00:09:34.791]  I don't like the draft boards being set back up.
[00:09:34.851 --> 00:09:35.951]  That's not an urban legend.
[00:09:36.231 --> 00:09:38.592]  Or the bills introduced to reinstate the draft.
[00:09:39.432 --> 00:09:41.573]  I believe national conscription is slavery.
[00:09:42.113 --> 00:09:45.534]  I don't think that we can be a sovereign nation with open borders.
[00:09:45.574 --> 00:09:50.156]  And I know our government is funding Mexico and others to help dissolve our borders.
[00:09:51.656 --> 00:09:54.217]  On some issues, people will call me a liberal.
[00:09:55.257 --> 00:09:57.578]  On other issues, they will call me a conservative.
[00:09:57.618 --> 00:10:06.420]  Folks, I know we have a lot of new listeners every day, every five minutes, so I'm just recapping the fact that this broadcast is about liberty.
[00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:08.341]  It's about controlling your own destiny.
[00:10:08.701 --> 00:10:17.564]  I don't look at an issue, well, since Hillary is a Democrat, I guess I'm for open borders and wiretaps and troll and international taxation.
[00:10:18.084 --> 00:10:22.325]  No, I look at it and go, I don't care whether Hillary Clinton is a Republican or a Democrat.
[00:10:22.905 --> 00:10:27.671]  I'm going to be against her because most of her policies and her directions are bad.
[00:10:28.091 --> 00:10:29.032]  Same thing with George Bush.
[00:10:29.052 --> 00:10:32.296]  I don't look at George Bush and go, rah, rah, I'm on a football team.
[00:10:32.616 --> 00:10:33.817]  I've got that mentality.
[00:10:33.857 --> 00:10:35.559]  Whatever the team does, I'm for it.
[00:10:35.819 --> 00:10:41.546]  I'm going to mindlessly wave a pennant in the air and paint my face up red, white, and blue and wear an elephant mask.
[00:10:42.572 --> 00:10:48.156]  I look at Bush and go, he spent more money than all presidents before him combined.
[00:10:48.977 --> 00:10:53.581]  He is ballooning every so-called liberal government agency ever heard of.
[00:10:53.841 --> 00:10:58.845]  In fact, if Democrats really like what Democrats have done in the past, they should love George Bush.
[00:11:00.126 --> 00:11:08.014]  George Bush has signed back on to United Nations treaties to regulate much of the federal and state governments' operations.
[00:11:08.114 --> 00:11:18.384]  George Bush has just done countless things that are the complete opposite from what you would call classical conservatism.
[00:11:18.424 --> 00:11:18.565]  So...
[00:11:19.966 --> 00:11:24.330]  We don't have a dog in the fight as per-political parties.
[00:11:25.051 --> 00:11:29.735]  I'm simply trying to defend our liberties that have made America so great.
[00:11:29.755 --> 00:11:30.316]  I mean, we're only 4%.
[00:11:30.356 --> 00:11:30.636]  4% out of 100%.
[00:11:30.676 --> 00:11:30.636]  4%.
[00:11:30.716 --> 00:11:32.338]  Not even one half of a decimal.
[00:11:32.358 --> 00:11:33.059]  Not even one half of 10%.
[00:11:33.099 --> 00:11:33.319]  We are 4%.
[00:11:42.609 --> 00:11:48.758]  Of the world's population, 96% of the people of the world are not Americans.
[00:11:49.559 --> 00:11:51.702]  Why has America been so different?
[00:11:52.043 --> 00:11:54.607]  Why have we had half the world's wealth?
[00:11:55.512 --> 00:12:13.579]  There's a lot of reasons, and we haven't been perfect, and we've had corruption and problems, but there was still limited freedom, a freedom greater than any other country or people has ever enjoyed in the history of the world, and it was because people fought for every millimeter of liberty we have.
[00:12:14.099 --> 00:12:18.861]  Americans died because they were very jealous of their liberties.
[00:12:19.521 --> 00:12:25.163]  Because our forefathers came here through adversity, whether you're Hispanic, black, white, it doesn't matter.
[00:12:25.203 --> 00:12:26.864]  We all share that.
[00:12:26.964 --> 00:12:32.946]  We were the rebels, the criminals, the adventurers, the slaves, the sharecroppers, the indentured servants.
[00:12:33.661 --> 00:12:34.281]  We are.
[00:12:34.301 --> 00:12:36.622]  It's just like the Australians are very hardy.
[00:12:36.662 --> 00:12:38.142]  They come from the same type of stock.
[00:12:39.283 --> 00:12:45.124]  And we built this country because there was some freedom and low taxation.
[00:12:45.144 --> 00:13:02.229]  There wasn't regulation and the guild control systems and the apprentice control systems and the mercantile economic systems that were designed by royalty and their minions to keep new money and new wealth from forming because that wasn't
[00:13:02.789 --> 00:13:14.694]  As powerful a force, it was there to a certain extent, it allowed an engine of wealth, a dynamism of amazing creativity and inventiveness to flourish.
[00:13:16.152 --> 00:13:17.933]  And I'm trying to defend that.
[00:13:17.993 --> 00:13:19.974]  So please, put on your thinking caps.
[00:13:19.994 --> 00:13:21.694]  Don't believe a word I say.
[00:13:21.854 --> 00:13:23.275]  Research what I claim.
[00:13:23.695 --> 00:13:26.676]  Get past your Republican and Democratic labels.
[00:13:27.117 --> 00:13:37.621]  And let's come together as populists, as Americans, and relearn, rediscover what Americana truly is and the promise it offers all of us.
[00:13:38.986 --> 00:13:41.990]  Now, I've got all this news about government-sponsored propaganda.
[00:13:42.530 --> 00:13:49.538]  I mean, just outright written by government psychiatrists and sociologists and people with three degrees in advertising.
[00:13:49.578 --> 00:13:57.687]  I mean, they've got armies of tens of thousands of them openly working to lie to you, to dumb you down, to confuse you, to give you false political paradigms.
[00:13:57.987 --> 00:13:58.328]  We're good to go.
[00:14:20.094 --> 00:14:34.724]  When you then read 1984, you realize what a genius George Orwell was because he speaks so much about the mangling of the language, the changing of it, the reducing of the language to a smaller and smaller group of words that are used.
[00:14:35.265 --> 00:14:36.726]  That is so central here.
[00:14:37.401 --> 00:14:53.788]  So again, you've got to throw out all the basic terms you've been given because those terms weren't used until 105 years ago when the big banks openly came in and paid off the colleges and the high schools and the technical schools to give you this false paradigm.
[00:14:55.009 --> 00:14:58.331]  And their memos, their books, their publications are all public.
[00:14:58.351 --> 00:14:59.331]  They all brag about it.
[00:14:59.351 --> 00:15:00.391]  They call us slaves.
[00:15:00.772 --> 00:15:02.192]  And folks, I'm mad about this.
[00:15:02.832 --> 00:15:05.574]  I'm mad about this, and I want you to wake up to their scam.
[00:15:05.914 --> 00:15:07.314]  I want you to find out what's happening.
[00:15:07.414 --> 00:15:07.675]  All right.
[00:15:08.475 --> 00:15:12.517]  Before I go any further, there are lies every day that I read about.
[00:15:12.617 --> 00:15:15.958]  Admitted, falsified data by governments.
[00:15:16.538 --> 00:15:22.061]  And I don't know how we catch the governments knowingly, premeditatively, from the highest levels.
[00:15:25.095 --> 00:15:29.501]  Lying to us on purpose and then we just trust them over and over again.
[00:15:31.122 --> 00:15:36.629]  I was over in the United Kingdom just a few days after a young man was murdered.
[00:15:40.052 --> 00:15:44.817]  And we all heard that he had bombs around him, wires all over him, a huge padded coat.
[00:15:44.857 --> 00:15:52.564]  He ran from police, jumped the turnstiles, ran into one of the trains, and then was going to blow himself up, so they shot him twice in the head.
[00:15:52.984 --> 00:15:57.589]  Then we heard it was four times, then eight times, then 12 times, and last time we heard 14 times.
[00:15:57.649 --> 00:16:04.896]  And then now they've quietly admitted, it's been in the news, but back of the paper, not big headlines, that he walked, he was wearing a blue jean shirt,
[00:16:05.496 --> 00:16:05.897]  We're good to go.
[00:16:23.934 --> 00:16:26.195]  Then they lied about it and falsified the reports.
[00:16:26.255 --> 00:16:28.036]  Now we know they falsified the reports.
[00:16:28.056 --> 00:16:32.638]  We've known that for months because the eyewitnesses and other police have gone public and said it's all a lie.
[00:16:32.898 --> 00:16:34.038]  Well, now we have the reports.
[00:16:34.058 --> 00:16:41.901]  We have the Scotland Yard's own report, and we have the Police Complaints Commission, IPCC's report.
[00:16:42.301 --> 00:16:53.346]  And again, there are literally, folks, I have a stack of such news reports here today with the police manufacturing evidence in New York, Houston, Dallas, Texas...
[00:16:54.146 --> 00:16:55.127]  Every day I have these.
[00:16:55.148 --> 00:16:57.650]  I mean, this is just standard operating procedure.
[00:16:57.951 --> 00:16:59.392]  It isn't that I dislike police.
[00:16:59.773 --> 00:17:03.376]  I'm upset that it's gotten to this point where it is institutionalized.
[00:17:04.578 --> 00:17:09.723]  The question is, though, why were special branch paramilitary police dispatched to kill him?
[00:17:09.763 --> 00:17:12.386]  They followed him from his home there and then murdered him.
[00:17:12.727 --> 00:17:14.769]  It isn't because they thought he was a terrorist, folks.
[00:17:16.007 --> 00:17:23.711]  They normally use Latin Americans to double as Muslims in some of these MI6, Mossad, Shin Bet, CIA ops.
[00:17:23.831 --> 00:17:25.452]  I believe he was somebody who saw too much.
[00:17:26.312 --> 00:17:28.213]  And that's what all the evidence shows.
[00:17:28.253 --> 00:17:29.874]  The bombs were clearly under the trains.
[00:17:29.894 --> 00:17:30.995]  We have police saying that.
[00:17:31.335 --> 00:17:32.195]  Witnesses saying that.
[00:17:32.715 --> 00:17:34.336]  I mean, I'm making a whole film about it.
[00:17:34.436 --> 00:17:36.597]  So, again, I...
[00:17:38.550 --> 00:17:45.934]  Hesitate even talking about the government being behind the London bombings because I could talk for three hours about it and not even cover all the hardcore evidence.
[00:17:46.254 --> 00:17:49.015]  I mean, I've had former number one FBI...
[00:17:50.675 --> 00:18:03.105]  Terrorism expert John Loftus on this show, number one at FBI, has a show on ABC Radio, to say, yes, a SWAT, the lead bomber, was MI6, and the government clearly wasn't involved and behind it.
[00:18:03.585 --> 00:18:05.426]  I mean, that's John Loftus.
[00:18:05.486 --> 00:18:07.488]  I mean, that's one piece of hundreds.
[00:18:07.568 --> 00:18:09.770]  I mean, I'm making a whole film about it right now.
[00:18:09.790 --> 00:18:11.871]  Well, that's not accurate.
[00:18:11.891 --> 00:18:19.277]  I'm making a part of the film, about 30 minutes of a two-hour film, is about the London bombings themselves, and a few minutes on Menendez, Demendez,
[00:18:20.647 --> 00:18:24.929]  But the point here is that they lied about this premeditatively day one.
[00:18:25.650 --> 00:18:26.950]  And I went to the tube station.
[00:18:26.970 --> 00:18:28.411]  I went to the place where he was killed.
[00:18:28.471 --> 00:18:30.652]  I went to the turnstiles where he was murdered.
[00:18:31.352 --> 00:18:33.193]  I went to, you know, that's as far as you go.
[00:18:33.213 --> 00:18:34.314]  The train obviously is moving.
[00:18:34.354 --> 00:18:34.934]  It wasn't there.
[00:18:35.494 --> 00:18:38.956]  But I went to the very spot where the train was where he was murdered.
[00:18:39.256 --> 00:18:41.637]  And I walked outside and talked to a bunch of the locals.
[00:18:41.677 --> 00:18:43.538]  And when we come back, I want to play a clip of them.
[00:18:43.558 --> 00:18:45.099]  This has never before been heard.
[00:18:48.394 --> 00:18:52.037]  A small segment from the film that won't be released for months and months because it's going to be a dandy.
[00:18:52.097 --> 00:18:53.438]  I put a lot of time into it.
[00:18:54.639 --> 00:19:00.863]  And she just regurgitates the entire government line, and this was about a week and a half after he'd been murdered.
[00:19:01.164 --> 00:19:03.625]  It was already in the news that that was all lies.
[00:19:04.046 --> 00:19:05.207]  She doesn't care, folks.
[00:19:05.687 --> 00:19:13.673]  She's going to regurgitate what's comfortable to her because she doesn't want to imagine that statistically and historically...
[00:19:14.503 --> 00:19:16.926]  Governments are what you must fear the most.
[00:19:16.986 --> 00:19:19.769]  They're big, they're organized, they're unbridled.
[00:19:20.870 --> 00:19:25.475]  There's no one there to hold them back unless the people stand up and stand up early.
[00:19:25.836 --> 00:19:28.058]  Things always go bad if you don't.
[00:19:28.078 --> 00:19:30.160]  So I want to play this clip of her.
[00:19:30.180 --> 00:19:33.224]  Well, first it's us in studio when I had the Watsons over here in the U.S.
[00:19:33.264 --> 00:19:33.864]  talking about it.
[00:19:33.904 --> 00:19:35.266]  Then we cut to the video.
[00:19:36.551 --> 00:19:38.253]  I want to play what she has to say.
[00:19:38.294 --> 00:19:40.136]  Just amazing doublethink as well.
[00:19:41.017 --> 00:19:42.980]  Orwellian doublethink involved here.
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:44.422]  And then read some of this article.
[00:19:44.782 --> 00:19:53.393]  Then I'll get into a bunch of news about government-sponsored propaganda overseas and here domestically and the latest situations with Iran.
[00:19:57.409 --> 00:19:59.350]  You need your cup of coffee each morning, right?
[00:19:59.650 --> 00:20:01.411]  But you're not sure if it's right for your health.
[00:20:01.771 --> 00:20:03.012]  Now there's Gano Coffee.
[00:20:03.332 --> 00:20:08.014]  Gano Coffee is the new, low-acid, low-caffeine, naturally healthy coffee.
[00:20:08.314 --> 00:20:16.498]  What makes Gano Coffee special is the secret ingredient Ganoderma, a concentration of red reishi mushroom, also known as the miraculous king of herbs.
[00:20:16.718 --> 00:20:17.298]  We're good to go.
[00:20:17.358 --> 00:20:17.959]  We're good to go.
[00:20:36.312 --> 00:20:36.973]  Currency, devaluation, inflation.
[00:20:37.013 --> 00:20:37.693]  One and the same.
[00:21:06.474 --> 00:21:16.317]  If you had deposited $100,000 in a bank at 1% in a 30-month period dating from May 24, 2005, here is what happened to your funds.
[00:21:16.737 --> 00:21:19.859]  The dollar lost 33% of its value in that time frame.
[00:21:20.119 --> 00:21:21.539]  The bank paid you 1%.
[00:21:21.819 --> 00:21:25.040]  Your $100,000 now has a net purchasing power of $68,000.
[00:21:25.580 --> 00:21:27.801]  Here is reality.
[00:21:28.161 --> 00:21:31.743]  The devaluation of currency equals real inflation.
[00:21:32.243 --> 00:21:35.844]  Keep in mind how the value of your paper assets are measured in dollars.
[00:21:36.454 --> 00:21:36.874]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:36.914 --> 00:21:37.135]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:56.983 --> 00:21:58.624]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:21:58.744 --> 00:22:02.846]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[00:22:02.986 --> 00:22:05.868]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[00:22:05.948 --> 00:22:12.631]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[00:22:12.831 --> 00:22:15.833]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[00:22:16.053 --> 00:22:18.434]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[00:22:18.574 --> 00:22:28.700]  Like murky elements, not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as aptazine, benzene, chloride, and chloroform.
[00:22:29.180 --> 00:22:31.401]  Or order on the web at BerkeyWater.com.
[00:22:56.582 --> 00:23:03.667]  Is black magic performed daily right in plain view on television, in movies, and in America's leading newspapers and magazines?
[00:23:04.307 --> 00:23:05.088]  I'm Tex Mars.
[00:23:05.508 --> 00:23:09.711]  My newest book, Codex Magica, is a real eye-opener.
[00:23:09.731 --> 00:23:13.293]  624 pages, over 1,000 photographs.
[00:23:13.834 --> 00:23:22.680]  Codex Magica shows the world's leading celebrities, from movie stars and presidents to bankers and senators, caught in the act.
[00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:26.922]  Discover the true secret signs of the Illuminati.
[00:23:27.182 --> 00:23:28.603]  Their mysterious symbols.
[00:23:28.943 --> 00:23:30.464]  Their hidden language.
[00:23:31.104 --> 00:23:31.964]  Encyclopedic.
[00:23:32.565 --> 00:23:33.165]  Documented.
[00:23:33.445 --> 00:23:37.527]  Codex Magica unmasked a conspiracy of immense evil.
[00:23:38.331 --> 00:23:47.702]  Please, order your personal copy of Codex Magica on the internet at powerofprophecy.com or simply phone toll-free 1-800-234-9673 That's 1-800-234-9673
[00:24:01.001 --> 00:24:04.103]  So, police make tube death log.
[00:24:04.123 --> 00:24:11.887]  Now, another branch of the myriad police agencies in London has looked at the logs and talked to the police, and yeah, they were told to falsify them.
[00:24:12.347 --> 00:24:12.788]  No kidding.
[00:24:12.828 --> 00:24:21.853]  You went and sat on a guy and shot him 14 times in the head, and the people doing it should go to prison, but again, in a police state, that doesn't happen.
[00:24:22.393 --> 00:24:24.915]  So, let's cut to a little section...
[00:24:26.115 --> 00:24:41.662]  From my new documentary I'm working on, actually a lot of this will actually be cut out of the film itself, but just some raw footage from the film where we're talking to this lady right outside where Demendez was killed at the fruit stand and what she had to say.
[00:24:41.702 --> 00:24:44.423]  But first we comment in studio.
[00:24:45.003 --> 00:24:50.285]  This is some video from in studio, inside the radio studio when Paul Watson and Steve Watson were here in the U.S.
[00:24:50.965 --> 00:24:52.226]  just a few months ago.
[00:24:52.286 --> 00:24:52.906]  Go ahead and roll it.
[00:24:53.326 --> 00:24:54.507]  What about the woman that said...
[00:24:56.497 --> 00:24:57.438]  I'm for torture.
[00:24:57.478 --> 00:24:58.478]  It keeps us safe.
[00:24:59.399 --> 00:25:02.321]  Well, she said... Take my freedom for my liberty, yeah.
[00:25:02.641 --> 00:25:09.305]  Yeah, she said she wanted to give up liberty for freedom, which is just completely contradictory.
[00:25:09.345 --> 00:25:10.386]  Well, set that up for people.
[00:25:10.466 --> 00:25:13.608]  We're right outside the place where now it turns out they shot him, what, 14 times?
[00:25:14.649 --> 00:25:15.369]  Tell folks about that.
[00:25:15.810 --> 00:25:19.732]  Yeah, well, we went to Stockwell Tube Station where they shot the Brazilian man.
[00:25:20.553 --> 00:25:22.194]  I think it was, how many times was it, eight?
[00:25:22.214 --> 00:25:23.615]  They shot him eight times.
[00:25:23.635 --> 00:25:24.955]  The number grew even more after that.
[00:25:24.995 --> 00:25:25.436]  It's more.
[00:25:26.078 --> 00:25:27.138]  Well, it's enough anyway.
[00:25:28.519 --> 00:25:32.819]  And, yeah, we basically noticed this woman who was working on the fruit stall.
[00:25:32.859 --> 00:25:34.520]  She'd been interviewed on the BBC.
[00:25:34.540 --> 00:25:36.580]  I'd seen her on there, so we went over to interview her.
[00:25:37.761 --> 00:25:42.241]  We were talking to her, and Alex asked her if she would sacrifice liberty for security.
[00:25:43.202 --> 00:25:46.502]  And she came back with, yes, I'll sacrifice liberty for freedom.
[00:25:47.483 --> 00:25:49.083]  Liberty and freedom are the same thing.
[00:25:49.763 --> 00:25:53.944]  We then asked her again to clarify, just in case she made a mistake, and she said the same thing again.
[00:25:54.485 --> 00:25:56.386]  She was willing to give up liberty for freedom.
[00:25:57.027 --> 00:26:01.430]  Which is really, it's direct doublethink, because the two things mean the same thing.
[00:26:02.670 --> 00:26:06.833]  What did you witness with the unfortunate Brazilian man that died?
[00:26:06.873 --> 00:26:09.895]  All we saw was the police running into the station with guns.
[00:26:10.336 --> 00:26:10.996]  That's all we saw.
[00:26:11.456 --> 00:26:12.717]  We didn't see anything else at all.
[00:26:12.757 --> 00:26:17.060]  And then after that, a couple of seconds after that, we were vacated down South Lambeth Road.
[00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:18.421]  That was all we saw.
[00:26:19.061 --> 00:26:19.982]  We didn't see anything else.
[00:26:20.715 --> 00:26:22.678]  I mean, are you sad for him and his family that he's dead?
[00:26:22.938 --> 00:26:25.622]  Oh, yeah, but at the end of the day, he should have stopped and surrendered, shouldn't he?
[00:26:25.742 --> 00:26:28.265]  If it had happened in his own country, he would have been shot down as well.
[00:26:28.506 --> 00:26:33.713]  So, with all that's gone on, the police were only doing what they thought was best, as far as I'm concerned.
[00:26:34.133 --> 00:26:35.275]  Why do you think he ran?
[00:26:36.152 --> 00:26:41.616]  Well, because his visa had run out, obviously, but you're not going to have armed police running after him just because his visa's run out, are they?
[00:26:41.636 --> 00:26:47.060]  So, the police were protecting, you know, the people travelling on the tube, so I don't see any wrong in what the police have done at all.
[00:26:47.080 --> 00:26:48.281]  No, I understand your view on that.
[00:26:48.301 --> 00:26:50.003]  Why do you think they shot him eight times in the head?
[00:26:50.023 --> 00:26:50.483]  I don't know.
[00:26:50.503 --> 00:26:51.644]  It's a lot of times to shoot him.
[00:26:51.664 --> 00:26:53.225]  It is a lot of times to shoot him.
[00:26:53.265 --> 00:26:54.566]  How many times did you hear they shot him?
[00:26:55.246 --> 00:26:56.027]  Five at first.
[00:26:57.188 --> 00:27:00.190]  Five, and then... No, three at first, then five, then it went up to eight.
[00:27:00.731 --> 00:27:00.951]  So...
[00:27:02.253 --> 00:27:04.654]  And I, the police admit they tackled him in this show.
[00:27:05.195 --> 00:27:06.755]  Well they told him to surrender, didn't they?
[00:27:06.776 --> 00:27:08.616]  They told him to stop, and he didn't.
[00:27:08.636 --> 00:27:09.817]  He carried on running, so.
[00:27:11.218 --> 00:27:11.538]  You know.
[00:27:11.998 --> 00:27:16.461]  What else could they have done, as far as I'm concerned?
[00:27:16.481 --> 00:27:16.801]  007, huh?
[00:27:16.941 --> 00:27:16.801]  007.
[00:27:16.981 --> 00:27:18.642]  License to kill.
[00:27:18.702 --> 00:27:18.942]  Yeah.
[00:27:19.162 --> 00:27:21.423]  I still believe that there should be a shoot to kill policy.
[00:27:21.824 --> 00:27:22.464]  I still believe.
[00:27:23.364 --> 00:27:23.945]  Personally.
[00:27:24.125 --> 00:27:25.265]  But that's my views, you know.
[00:27:26.166 --> 00:27:28.027]  I think people should give up their liberty to freedom.
[00:27:29.560 --> 00:27:29.900]  Alright.
[00:27:31.502 --> 00:27:33.383]  I think people should give up their liberty for freedom.
[00:27:35.205 --> 00:27:41.170]  And of course, we doubled that last statement again, and in the film we have another clip where she said it a second time.
[00:27:44.091 --> 00:27:48.453]  Of course, even a week and a half after, it was admitted he wasn't running, he wasn't wearing a jacket.
[00:27:48.533 --> 00:27:49.934]  I just wasn't going to argue with her.
[00:27:50.354 --> 00:27:54.336]  So there it was already in the newspapers that none of it was true, but it was in the back of the paper.
[00:27:54.476 --> 00:27:59.578]  Always the government's lies, or the corporations that control the government's lies, are front and center.
[00:27:59.678 --> 00:28:05.161]  And then it almost always turns out to be totally false, but it's not just like the government's screwing up.
[00:28:05.221 --> 00:28:07.542]  They're doing it by design.
[00:28:08.564 --> 00:28:11.466]  And people think you give up liberty, you get security.
[00:28:11.486 --> 00:28:12.427]  You never get that.
[00:28:12.487 --> 00:28:14.229]  You get tyranny, you get enslaved.
[00:28:14.269 --> 00:28:24.757]  I mean, there is no security in having an all-powerful black ski mask, black uniform wearing, secret police, overarching government.
[00:28:24.797 --> 00:28:27.559]  And that's exactly what's being set up in this country.
[00:28:27.599 --> 00:28:32.203]  I mean, every day Bush gives a press conference or one of his surrogates comes out
[00:28:33.047 --> 00:28:36.830]  Like Press Secretary Scott McClellan, and says the President is the law.
[00:28:36.870 --> 00:28:38.531]  He can ignore anything Congress does.
[00:28:38.591 --> 00:28:40.332]  He can torture whoever he wants.
[00:28:40.372 --> 00:28:41.673]  They can torture children.
[00:28:42.973 --> 00:28:45.255]  They can do anything because he's the President.
[00:28:45.275 --> 00:28:46.516]  He has war powers.
[00:28:46.596 --> 00:28:48.277]  War powers do not do that.
[00:28:49.238 --> 00:28:52.860]  And for people out there who are in such denial, you see, now you're having a choice.
[00:28:53.220 --> 00:28:55.221]  The martial law is being announced.
[00:28:55.241 --> 00:29:00.625]  They're telling you, hey, we can do whatever we want, and if there's another attack, we're going to rule you.
[00:29:01.505 --> 00:29:08.648]  And now people get up on talk radio and TV, and Arnold Specter gets up on TV and says, well, the president may have those powers.
[00:29:09.529 --> 00:29:18.693]  Okay, does the president have the power to, say, chop children's heads off on the White House lawn and play polo with their heads?
[00:29:19.113 --> 00:29:19.414]  No!
[00:29:20.094 --> 00:29:23.435]  Does Bush have the power to ship cocaine in and snort it?
[00:29:24.116 --> 00:29:24.276]  No!
[00:29:25.015 --> 00:29:28.397]  Does he have the power to go around murdering women dressed up like a clown?
[00:29:28.917 --> 00:29:29.177]  No!
[00:29:29.537 --> 00:29:34.240]  Then he doesn't have the power to order people's children to be tortured in front of him.
[00:29:34.980 --> 00:29:37.441]  My goodness, what has happened to us?
[00:29:38.081 --> 00:29:41.143]  They're warping our entire social fabric.
[00:29:41.163 --> 00:29:45.125]  They're training us how to take part in mass evil.
[00:29:46.826 --> 00:29:47.806]  We're on the march.
[00:29:48.206 --> 00:29:49.847]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:49.867 --> 00:29:53.409]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:57.432 --> 00:30:03.794]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[00:30:04.014 --> 00:30:09.016]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using the Rife frequency technology.
[00:30:09.356 --> 00:30:17.259]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:30:17.399 --> 00:30:24.442]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:30:24.662 --> 00:30:25.883]  There are no side effects.
[00:30:26.023 --> 00:30:29.425]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[00:30:29.485 --> 00:30:30.605]  Don't just treat symptoms.
[00:30:30.886 --> 00:30:32.166]  Eliminate the cause.
[00:30:32.367 --> 00:30:39.190]  BioSolutions has over 550 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[00:30:39.311 --> 00:30:41.772]  Customer satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.

[00:30:57.071 --> 00:31:03.333]  The illuminated Berkey base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[00:31:03.453 --> 00:31:09.616]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[00:31:09.896 --> 00:31:18.319]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[00:31:18.579 --> 00:31:25.602]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter, and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[00:31:25.902 --> 00:31:30.725]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[00:31:30.945 --> 00:31:36.369]  The Berkey Base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[00:31:36.689 --> 00:31:39.771]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[00:31:40.112 --> 00:31:48.077]  Get the illuminated Berkey Base for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:31:48.117 --> 00:31:48.697]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[00:31:58.425 --> 00:32:01.088]  Is your quality of life reduced because of health problems?
[00:32:01.308 --> 00:32:03.090]  Are you starting to feel the signs of aging?
[00:32:03.270 --> 00:32:07.295]  Are you relatively healthy but wonder if you can do more to maintain proper health?
[00:32:07.475 --> 00:32:08.856]  Now there's Stem Enhance.
[00:32:09.257 --> 00:32:13.842]  Stem Enhance is a new product category of phytonutrients that help in renewing your body.
[00:32:14.102 --> 00:32:19.907]  Stem Enhance's natural ingredients help to support the release of stem cells from your bone marrow into your bloodstream.
[00:32:20.127 --> 00:32:31.557]  Through a natural process, those stem cells have the amazing ability to transform into any type of cell in the body, like heart cells, brain cells, liver cells, can all be generated from this powerful building block.
[00:32:31.817 --> 00:32:41.325]  Thousands of people who use Stem Enhance have reported spectacular results, experiencing everything from an increase in energy in just a few days to an improvement in overall health.
[00:32:41.645 --> 00:32:46.626]  Not available in stores, Stem Enhance is available by contacting Dr. Patricia Margaitis at 860-567-7744.
[00:32:46.766 --> 00:32:47.026]  That's 860-567-7744.
[00:32:47.086 --> 00:32:48.767]  They railed against the crowd Another ragtag band
[00:33:12.826 --> 00:33:20.910]  All right, Tony, Alan, Bob, Eddie, Maggie, we've got calls from Arkansas, United Kingdom, Connecticut, Texas, you name it.
[00:33:20.930 --> 00:33:23.572]  We're going to go to everybody here in about five minutes or so.
[00:33:25.973 --> 00:33:33.577]  Last week, I played this clip off of MSNBC television with the Oberman Report countdown.
[00:33:34.381 --> 00:33:43.185]  Where they had General Michael Hayden on, and I heard the rebroadcast this weekend, and I wasn't satisfied with my performance covering all the facets of this.
[00:33:43.205 --> 00:33:45.426]  They have the head of the NSA.
[00:33:45.586 --> 00:33:47.386]  He was the head until about six months ago.
[00:33:47.407 --> 00:33:49.828]  Now he's the head of another federal department.
[00:33:50.628 --> 00:33:57.711]  I've since watched online much of his speech, and he brags about how wonderful the head of all intelligence is.
[00:33:58.311 --> 00:34:00.352]  By the way, he's a former death squad mastermind.
[00:34:01.427 --> 00:34:03.468]  And it's John Negroponte.
[00:34:03.528 --> 00:34:04.709]  Very, very scary stuff.
[00:34:05.690 --> 00:34:09.712]  And then he says, believe me, the NSA knows the Fourth Amendment knows the law.
[00:34:10.332 --> 00:34:16.175]  Well, it's been all over the news that the NSA broke federal law every time they spied on U.S.
[00:34:16.195 --> 00:34:19.477]  citizens without a warrant, without going to the FISA court.
[00:34:19.537 --> 00:34:23.319]  That's admitted, and Bush has said he doesn't have to follow that law.
[00:34:24.702 --> 00:34:33.268]  But no, this version of lying is just that no, no, no, we're allowed to because the Fourth Amendment says nothing about probable cause.
[00:34:34.248 --> 00:34:34.809]  Well, you're right.
[00:34:34.849 --> 00:34:37.291]  It says a lot more than just probable cause.
[00:34:37.311 --> 00:34:38.571]  You don't just need probable cause.
[00:34:38.952 --> 00:34:50.920]  The probable cause is based on an oath or affirmation, a sworn testimony of what it is illegally you're doing and exactly where it is and what the police specifically are looking for.
[00:34:50.960 --> 00:34:52.241]  They can only look for that.
[00:34:52.561 --> 00:34:54.342]  They can't be on a fishing expedition.
[00:34:55.473 --> 00:35:02.619]  And I read the Fourth Amendment last week, but I think because it's such a secret nowadays, what the Bill of Rights says, I'll read it again.
[00:35:03.039 --> 00:35:20.234]  The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects against unreasonable search and seizures shall not be violated, and no warrant shall be issued but upon probable cause supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched and the persons or things to be seized.
[00:35:22.415 --> 00:35:23.595]  Things to be seen.
[00:35:23.675 --> 00:35:25.756]  So, that's how the Bill of Rights works.
[00:35:25.856 --> 00:35:32.757]  It will state the name, and then it will give you the definition.
[00:35:32.777 --> 00:35:39.278]  So, they're telling you that the people are to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects.
[00:35:39.738 --> 00:35:40.738]  That means your car.
[00:35:41.238 --> 00:35:43.379]  That means your person walking down the street.
[00:35:43.419 --> 00:35:47.399]  You have a Fourth Amendment, and it says against unreasonable searches and seizures.
[00:35:47.719 --> 00:35:49.980]  Then it tells you what a reasonable one is.
[00:35:52.506 --> 00:35:58.367]  It says, no warrant shall be issued but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation.
[00:35:58.387 --> 00:35:59.488]  You get sworn testimony here.
[00:35:59.868 --> 00:36:05.289]  And I sped past this last week, but let me cover it calmly.
[00:36:05.309 --> 00:36:12.691]  These confidential informants, where they're not even in the courtroom, and you go to jail for life, and you find out it was some crackhead that sent you down the river.
[00:36:12.951 --> 00:36:16.411]  And they have hired liars with a rap sheet 15 feet thick.
[00:36:17.372 --> 00:36:18.492]  Literally, in some cases.
[00:36:19.139 --> 00:36:22.642]  Well, according to the Constitution and the Bill of Rights, that is totally illegal.
[00:36:23.122 --> 00:36:25.204]  And it says in here, you do this, you go to prison.
[00:36:25.404 --> 00:36:26.825]  By the way, folks, there's only ten of them.
[00:36:26.845 --> 00:36:30.728]  You violate these, I mean, you can be executed as a traitor.
[00:36:31.609 --> 00:36:32.890]  I mean, these are the big laws.
[00:36:32.910 --> 00:36:38.734]  These are above the local policies of the local drug-dealing police chief in your town.
[00:36:40.756 --> 00:36:43.178]  So it just makes my head spin.
[00:36:43.238 --> 00:36:48.782]  But on top of it, the NSA knows that it's a violation of federal law.
[00:36:51.793 --> 00:36:53.134]  Every time they spy on you.
[00:36:53.154 --> 00:36:56.876]  Then they try this line of, well, here's their analogy.
[00:36:57.356 --> 00:37:04.000]  If your wife's going into labor and about to have a baby, you don't call the judge first to ask if it's okay if you speed to the hospital.
[00:37:04.620 --> 00:37:05.921]  You speed to the hospital.
[00:37:06.521 --> 00:37:09.163]  Well, I'm against the FISA court to begin with.
[00:37:09.423 --> 00:37:13.085]  The FISA court that the government ignored, that elements of the government ignored.
[00:37:13.840 --> 00:37:29.046]  Simply said that within a month, you had to go back to them to get whatever spying you did certified, and those were blank check warrants where every time they signed off on it, and this was retroactively, by the way, in hindsight, they could spy on tens of thousands of people.
[00:37:31.138 --> 00:37:36.103]  So what the government does is they take the least little example of it that sounds the most reasonable.
[00:37:36.383 --> 00:37:44.270]  They have a national debate about it, have these fake polls where half the people are for it, and then they start the process of conditioning you.
[00:37:44.410 --> 00:37:46.672]  And again, there are whole college courses taught on this.
[00:37:47.033 --> 00:37:47.874]  This is public.
[00:37:48.114 --> 00:37:49.875]  This is a shake-and-bake operation.
[00:37:49.895 --> 00:37:51.177]  I mean, here's another example.
[00:37:51.577 --> 00:37:52.358]  AP, U.S.
[00:37:52.418 --> 00:37:55.721]  Army, has seized wives of insurgents in Iraq to force them to talk.
[00:37:56.241 --> 00:38:02.147]  And then it says, in two cases, they grab the woman and they say, if you don't come turn yourself in, we're going to do something to your wife and baby.
[00:38:02.547 --> 00:38:04.669]  And they deny the baby's milk and stuff like that.
[00:38:05.910 --> 00:38:11.035]  Now, the Army's actual reports say it's been done thousands of times, and there are huge prisons filled with women.
[00:38:11.744 --> 00:38:16.686]  They'll come into towns and grab all the women until all the men down to age 11 come and turn themselves in.
[00:38:16.946 --> 00:38:22.888]  That has been in hundreds of mainstream news articles overseas, in Europe, even a few here, government reports here.
[00:38:23.228 --> 00:38:26.149]  But by the time it hits our nightly news, oh, they grab two women.
[00:38:26.629 --> 00:38:27.329]  It's thousands.
[00:38:27.589 --> 00:38:28.069]  Thousands.
[00:38:28.410 --> 00:38:31.631]  Sometimes whole towns are grabbed in a single day of thousands of people.
[00:38:33.051 --> 00:38:36.132]  But by the time we hear about it, it's two people they did it to.
[00:38:37.773 --> 00:38:38.633]  I'll go to your calls in a minute.
[00:38:38.653 --> 00:38:38.913]  I've just...
[00:38:40.618 --> 00:38:43.221]  I'm trying to describe for people, because this is what I do.
[00:38:43.301 --> 00:38:43.941]  I study this.
[00:38:44.001 --> 00:38:45.002]  I look at propaganda.
[00:38:45.042 --> 00:38:46.183]  I understand how it works.
[00:38:46.524 --> 00:38:48.145]  And we counter it with the ultimate weapon.
[00:38:48.406 --> 00:38:49.266]  It's called the truth.
[00:38:49.406 --> 00:38:51.689]  But still, you have to go verify the truth.
[00:38:51.749 --> 00:38:53.610]  I want you to go research the claims I'm making.
[00:38:53.911 --> 00:38:56.133]  I don't want you to believe what I just said about the Fourth Amendment.
[00:38:56.573 --> 00:39:03.360]  You see, the head of the NSA, well, he's now in a position even above that, but the former head of the NSA gets up there, and they've got him all over the news and all over TV.
[00:39:04.160 --> 00:39:22.567]  From Alberto Gonzalez, who says Bush is above the law, to John Yoo, who says the same thing, to, you know, Bush's... Tommy Franks gets up on TV over and over again and announces, I'm not with the government anymore, I'm not a Republican or a Democrat, but we need martial law, we need to invade Iran, and I love George Bush.
[00:39:23.367 --> 00:39:29.049]  $400,000 paid to go lie, and then up front say he's not being paid to say this, and then it turns out he is.
[00:39:29.629 --> 00:39:33.052]  I mean, do you realize, folks, that isn't some liberal or conservative bias.
[00:39:33.092 --> 00:39:38.497]  That is mechanized, scientifically focused, high-tech tyranny.
[00:39:39.758 --> 00:39:42.880]  I mean, that should make everybody get chills up and down their spines.
[00:39:43.981 --> 00:39:49.205]  By the way, I know a lot of Republicans just love hearing Bush talk about martial law and how he's a dictator and how he has unlimited power.
[00:39:49.886 --> 00:39:51.167]  What about when Hillary's president?
[00:39:51.207 --> 00:39:52.308]  Are you going to like it then?
[00:39:55.129 --> 00:39:56.850]  Well, I'll actually support her now.
[00:39:56.930 --> 00:39:58.350]  She's for the war on terror.
[00:39:58.410 --> 00:39:58.890]  I've heard them.
[00:39:59.411 --> 00:40:00.011]  They're sick.
[00:40:02.712 --> 00:40:07.994]  So there's so many lies to what this general says when he talks about spying.
[00:40:08.094 --> 00:40:08.934]  Oh, believe me.
[00:40:08.974 --> 00:40:10.015]  He says, believe me.
[00:40:10.355 --> 00:40:11.595]  We know what the law is.
[00:40:11.635 --> 00:40:14.516]  And he's counting on you to not go read the Fourth Amendment.
[00:40:14.937 --> 00:40:18.478]  He's counting on you to not go read the federal laws on top of the Fourth Amendment.
[00:40:20.217 --> 00:40:33.942]  And you know, if the government can kind of helter-skelter whenever it wants to, pell-mell, sometimes will, sometimes don't, obey laws, then what does that say to you when you break a law?
[00:40:35.263 --> 00:40:35.603]  You see?
[00:40:35.623 --> 00:40:37.604]  I mean, this is serious business, folks.
[00:40:38.326 --> 00:40:42.888]  So, one more time, I want to play this clip from last Monday.
[00:40:42.928 --> 00:40:51.471]  We, of course, aired it on Friday, by the time we got the video clip of it, of the NSA general, this is up on prisonplanet.com if you want to see it, just lying to people.
[00:40:52.311 --> 00:40:52.712]  Lying.
[00:40:53.672 --> 00:41:00.174]  And, of course, it turns out memos from his very office back at 03 and 04 were saying, hey, this is illegal, we've got to cover it up.
[00:41:00.435 --> 00:41:06.157]  So we know he's premeditatedly, on TV, lying to you, engaging in psyops.
[00:41:06.197 --> 00:41:06.817]  Go ahead and roll it.
[00:41:07.805 --> 00:41:24.597]  My understanding is that the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution specifies that you must have probable cause to be able to do a search that does not violate an American's right against unlawful searches and seizures.
[00:41:24.937 --> 00:41:26.739]  The Fourth Amendment actually...
[00:41:27.359 --> 00:41:30.742]  It protects all of us against unreasonable search and seizure.
[00:41:31.002 --> 00:41:31.922]  That's what it says.
[00:41:31.942 --> 00:41:34.604]  But the measure is probable cause, I believe.
[00:41:34.624 --> 00:41:36.946]  The amendment says unreasonable search and seizure.
[00:41:37.266 --> 00:41:38.587]  But does it not say probable... No.
[00:41:38.607 --> 00:41:41.950]  The court's standard, the legal standard... The amendment says unreasonable search and seizure.
[00:41:41.970 --> 00:41:43.791]  The legal standard is probable cause.
[00:41:44.131 --> 00:41:53.378]  Just to be very clear, okay, and believe me, if there's any amendment to the Constitution that employees of the National Security Agency are familiar with, it's the Fourth, right?
[00:41:53.558 --> 00:41:56.580]  And it is a reasonable standard in the Fourth Amendment.
[00:41:57.902 --> 00:42:07.934]  To quote the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States in its entirety, the one the General and the NSA folks are so familiar with and know is about reasonableness and not about probable cause, quote,
[00:42:08.476 --> 00:42:28.383]  The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures shall not be violated, no warrant shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched and the persons or things to be seized.
[00:42:29.704 --> 00:42:32.304]  Well, maybe they have a different constitution over there at the NSA.
[00:42:33.265 --> 00:42:36.586]  Now ask yourselves, how many warrants are truly proper?
[00:42:37.305 --> 00:42:38.345]  Almost none.
[00:42:38.826 --> 00:42:50.890]  But it isn't enough for the Bush administration, and the Democrats lock, stock, and barrel are agreeing with it, setting this precedent, that not even the FISA or other special courts blank checks.
[00:42:51.090 --> 00:42:53.911]  They're actual rubber stamps retroactively.
[00:42:53.931 --> 00:42:58.833]  They don't just hand them a rubber stamp to spy on 10,000 of whoever you want to domestically.
[00:42:59.702 --> 00:43:01.163]  And then you run out and do it.
[00:43:01.243 --> 00:43:01.583]  No, no, no.
[00:43:01.623 --> 00:43:04.585]  You can come to them a month later, and they give you a big blank check.
[00:43:04.705 --> 00:43:06.086]  That's not even enough.
[00:43:06.146 --> 00:43:12.769]  They're just, we'll do whatever we want, whenever we want, to keep you safe from our CIA.
[00:43:14.010 --> 00:43:17.992]  So I've covered that, but meanwhile, we talk about government propaganda.
[00:43:18.012 --> 00:43:19.473]  Let me just mention this, and then we'll go to the calls.
[00:43:21.807 --> 00:43:22.167]  Bush.
[00:43:22.308 --> 00:43:24.810]  No doubt NSA surveillance is legal.
[00:43:25.550 --> 00:43:31.875]  And again, he tells us that it's not illegal, and that it's perfectly fine, and so go back to sleep, everything's wonderful.
[00:43:32.136 --> 00:43:34.918]  And that's because according to him, there is no law that he's governed by.
[00:43:36.019 --> 00:43:37.940]  And then we have this article here.
[00:43:38.040 --> 00:43:40.182]  Poll indicates mixed views on surveillance.
[00:43:40.242 --> 00:43:41.203]  United Press International.
[00:43:41.463 --> 00:43:46.387]  They had a big New York Times-CBS poll, and later I'll cover this, but it's called a push poll.
[00:43:46.667 --> 00:43:49.510]  If it'll keep you safe, can the government spy on terrorists?
[00:43:50.126 --> 00:43:51.831]  Well of course they can spy on terrorists.
[00:43:52.232 --> 00:43:57.767]  Then they get around half the people saying that they would.
[00:43:59.329 --> 00:44:03.450]  But then when they ask him in the poll, what if it's finally American people have asked for it?
[00:44:03.470 --> 00:44:03.870]  He said, no.
[00:44:04.130 --> 00:44:05.511]  Well, that's what this is.
[00:44:05.991 --> 00:44:08.852]  And again, we have this idea that it's this big, loving, sweet government.
[00:44:08.912 --> 00:44:19.995]  No, all it is is private corporations that have bought off different agencies and different groups and agencies that are using the government as their own tool to extract our tax dollars through corporate welfare into their coffers.
[00:44:20.275 --> 00:44:26.677]  And they know we're waking up to the gravy train, so they're putting in a control grid because they know we're going to revolt when they take our pensions.
[00:44:26.717 --> 00:44:27.797]  They've actually said that.
[00:44:28.693 --> 00:44:30.834]  That's what this whole police state's for, boys and girls.
[00:44:31.134 --> 00:44:32.795]  It is it for some guy in a turbot.
[00:44:33.275 --> 00:44:35.756]  Who, by the way, is on government payroll every time we check it out.
[00:44:36.796 --> 00:44:40.778]  I mean, I'm drowning in evidence of these terrorists being working for Western governments.
[00:44:41.278 --> 00:44:43.499]  Red-handed, it's public, declassified, admit it.
[00:44:43.699 --> 00:44:45.200]  Again, none of this is my opinion.
[00:44:45.800 --> 00:44:47.661]  So, poll indicates mixed views on surveillance.
[00:44:47.681 --> 00:44:48.201]  Well, of course.
[00:44:48.721 --> 00:44:50.602]  And then I have this really scary article.
[00:44:52.965 --> 00:44:54.467]  Out of the BBC, U.S.
[00:44:54.507 --> 00:44:56.588]  plans to fight the net revealed.
[00:44:56.628 --> 00:44:58.270]  And it's already been going on.
[00:44:58.310 --> 00:44:59.330]  They have cadres.
[00:44:59.631 --> 00:45:01.292]  They have agency groups that are doing it.
[00:45:01.372 --> 00:45:06.136]  Now they want to roll it out public and radically expand it, which is admitted in here since 2003.
[00:45:06.616 --> 00:45:12.681]  And it says domestic propaganda, planting fake news stories.
[00:45:12.741 --> 00:45:16.144]  And it gets into all these reporters that are paid off.
[00:45:17.766 --> 00:45:20.528]  Again, reporters paid off to lie to you.
[00:45:22.685 --> 00:45:25.970]  And then you read this BBC article that's reporting on it like it's no big deal.
[00:45:26.771 --> 00:45:29.535]  So we'll get into that.
[00:45:29.595 --> 00:45:32.719]  I mean, it's amazing the different things that are going on.
[00:45:33.160 --> 00:45:34.902]  Tony in Arkansas, you're on the air.
[00:45:34.942 --> 00:45:35.323]  Go ahead.
[00:45:37.113 --> 00:45:37.713]  Speak with you.
[00:45:38.114 --> 00:45:38.814]  Nice to speak to you.
[00:45:38.854 --> 00:45:39.214]  Go ahead.
[00:45:39.775 --> 00:45:46.179]  I just wanted to figure out some kind of importance that's happening in the next few days, kind of along the lines of Codex Magic and what Tex Mars talks about.
[00:45:46.500 --> 00:45:51.703]  When you follow the New World Order group, if you pay attention, you notice they tend to hit certain significant occult days.
[00:45:52.384 --> 00:45:56.186]  And one is coming up February 1st through the 2nd, which is in bulk.
[00:45:56.767 --> 00:45:59.048]  And there's other times they've used that date.
[00:45:59.448 --> 00:46:03.051]  But specifically, there's terror drills going to be going off in Charlotte.
[00:46:03.599 --> 00:46:12.846]  On those dates, and other websites reporting, some down in Houston, that there have been police chiefs coming forward saying they've been testing it near Texas City, Texas, and other things.
[00:46:13.107 --> 00:46:14.868]  Well, it's not police chiefs coming forward.
[00:46:14.888 --> 00:46:21.994]  It's been in the Houston Chronicle that they're having nuke attack drills in Houston, but that doesn't mean that there's going to be a nuke going off.
[00:46:22.254 --> 00:46:29.700]  Certainly, but I think that when we parallel, again, what happened in Charlotte, you going back to when you were on George Nury's program and Kevin P. Burns,
[00:46:30.160 --> 00:46:33.181]  By the way, a lot of that has been confirmed now.
[00:46:33.321 --> 00:46:36.601]  Not that there was going to be a new go-off, but that Burns wasn't toeing the line.
[00:46:36.621 --> 00:46:37.421]  We've confirmed that.
[00:46:37.441 --> 00:46:40.342]  No, we've talked to people that have talked to him.
[00:46:40.362 --> 00:46:44.343]  I've talked to people in government from multiple angles, and we've gotten the same thing.
[00:46:57.425 --> 00:47:04.550]  But this drill coming up specifically, you got on, George, but you put it up on your show and your website, and I've been trying to call as many programs as I can.
[00:47:04.590 --> 00:47:08.493]  I just think it's vital that we get... Well, I didn't do it this time with the new drill.
[00:47:08.813 --> 00:47:10.614]  Are you saying I did this time?
[00:47:10.634 --> 00:47:14.316]  Yeah, I saw up on your website, one of them, WorldNetDaily, a story link to the story.
[00:47:14.337 --> 00:47:16.198]  Yeah, we linked to the story about it, yes.
[00:47:16.238 --> 00:47:16.398]  Right.
[00:47:16.758 --> 00:47:31.964]  And I've been trying to get through to George and Mary every night because I think you guys may have averted, in fact, I'll just give my gut feeling, I believe you guys averted a terror attack by going on this program days before it happened and getting it out to 16, 20 million people, plus what you do on your program and other programs.
[00:47:31.984 --> 00:47:33.605]  And I've tried to call every night.
[00:47:33.625 --> 00:47:34.165]  I hear you.
[00:47:34.185 --> 00:47:37.807]  Tony, let me comment on this because it's a big deal because you called in about it.
[00:47:38.707 --> 00:47:40.270]  You know, you heard those shows.
[00:47:40.410 --> 00:47:41.732]  You read the news articles.
[00:47:41.892 --> 00:47:43.555]  Imagine the average person.
[00:47:44.055 --> 00:47:52.348]  All they hear is about nuke drills in Charlotte, North Carolina, and nuke drills in Detroit for the Super Bowl, and nuke drills in Houston.
[00:47:53.513 --> 00:47:53.934]  We're good to go.
[00:48:15.629 --> 00:48:17.849]  ...being hit at the exact same time.
[00:48:17.909 --> 00:48:28.071]  And even with a 10-year mean using an insurance-style actuary computer simulation, the calculation has 48 zeros on it.
[00:48:28.191 --> 00:48:29.751]  I can't even pronounce the number.
[00:48:30.111 --> 00:48:33.752]  It was one chance in basically infinity that that would happen.
[00:48:34.472 --> 00:48:40.433]  On 9-11, the government was running drills of the exact same targets being hit at the exact same times.
[00:48:41.053 --> 00:48:42.454]  And that's now been declassified.
[00:48:42.494 --> 00:48:44.694]  I covered it, what, two years before...
[00:48:45.872 --> 00:48:47.552]  It was even in USA Today.
[00:48:47.612 --> 00:48:50.493]  That really blew people away because I've gotten that from Pentagon sources.
[00:48:51.373 --> 00:48:53.894]  That's how they got the rest of NORAD to stand down.
[00:48:54.814 --> 00:48:56.574]  One element of the government says it's a drill.
[00:48:56.614 --> 00:48:58.415]  Everybody stands down and then it really happens.
[00:48:58.995 --> 00:49:12.538]  So when now there are drills, say in Charlotte, and we see certain key things happening, we just simply said, with the firing of the general who was over that days before, and we got some intel that something could happen, we said we need to look at this.
[00:49:14.267 --> 00:49:20.076]  Now, other people are running around saying that it could be the Super Bowl.
[00:49:20.136 --> 00:49:21.538]  And the government's hyping it.
[00:49:21.558 --> 00:49:23.421]  I mean, big martial law production.
[00:49:23.742 --> 00:49:25.725]  Same thing with the World Cup coming up in Europe.
[00:49:26.676 --> 00:49:37.701]  Over in England and Germany, that terrorists could strike and only the men in black uniforms searching everyone and hover blimps flying around and foreign... They're going to have foreign German soldiers on the streets of London.
[00:49:38.181 --> 00:49:39.841]  What are German soldiers needed for?
[00:49:40.582 --> 00:49:49.465]  As if Britain, with more police and military per capita than any other country in the world, and more cameras and surveillance than any other country in the world per capita, why would they need German troops?
[00:49:49.905 --> 00:49:52.466]  Why do we need Mexican and Dutch and British in New Orleans?
[00:49:52.807 --> 00:49:53.827]  They've signed the treaties.
[00:49:53.847 --> 00:49:54.767]  They're foreign troops.
[00:49:54.807 --> 00:49:56.148]  They really are planning to use them.
[00:49:56.548 --> 00:50:06.103]  I've interviewed the emergency manager from Kingsville, Texas, Thomas Sanchez, seven, eight years ago, when he was in secret military briefings about plans to take over South Texas using Delta Force.
[00:50:06.723 --> 00:50:10.169]  I mean, you know, this has been going on, this creeping takeover.
[00:50:11.164 --> 00:50:12.185]  For a long, long time.
[00:50:12.265 --> 00:50:20.989]  So, if we get caught up in constantly thinking there's about to be a nuke go off, the government uses that as fear to get us to go along with their aims.
[00:50:21.629 --> 00:50:29.013]  But at the same time, we should look at all these drills and realize that they could be used as a cover, as they have been in the past.
[00:50:29.053 --> 00:50:34.756]  But, listen, a nuke goes off, life as we know it ends in this country.
[00:50:35.096 --> 00:50:36.837]  The real police state starts.
[00:50:37.397 --> 00:50:38.898]  Unless we have an awakening...
[00:50:40.274 --> 00:50:43.597]  Who really has a motive to sacrifice part of a U.S.
[00:50:43.637 --> 00:50:52.546]  city to bring in total control and to give all the contracts of the entire government to their cronies, no questions asked, inside a police state where you don't ask questions?
[00:50:58.246 --> 00:51:01.108]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[00:51:01.368 --> 00:51:02.949]  Hello, my friends, Alex Jones here.
[00:51:03.289 --> 00:51:07.952]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law, 9-11, Rise of the Police State.
[00:51:08.292 --> 00:51:15.016]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[00:51:15.356 --> 00:51:17.338]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[00:51:17.558 --> 00:51:20.381]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[00:51:20.481 --> 00:51:25.145]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[00:51:25.345 --> 00:51:29.769]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[00:51:30.009 --> 00:51:37.236]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.

[00:51:57.412 --> 00:52:04.941]  Get the new Berkey battery adapter, an inexpensive yet long-term backup power supply for your Berkey Light LED system.
[00:52:05.221 --> 00:52:16.134]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because, incredibly, they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark.
[00:52:16.374 --> 00:52:18.196]  Yet require very little energy.
[00:52:18.457 --> 00:52:21.781]  That's why this revolutionary new technology is a bit expensive.
[00:52:22.121 --> 00:52:32.574]  But it's worth every penny because the low energy LEDs are able to provide light all night long for over two weeks on a single set of four AA alkaline batteries.
[00:52:32.874 --> 00:52:33.375]  That's right.
[00:52:33.555 --> 00:52:40.661]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[00:52:40.961 --> 00:52:49.708]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey battery adapter, complete with on-off switch for only $10 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[00:53:47.381 --> 00:53:53.265]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[00:54:05.623 --> 00:54:07.206]  It came out several years ago.
[00:54:07.226 --> 00:54:08.468]  It was declassified.
[00:54:08.488 --> 00:54:14.297]  It admitted that the White House has been issuing fake terror alerts for political aims.
[00:54:14.317 --> 00:54:18.524]  Just type in to Google or to Yahoo.
[00:54:18.564 --> 00:54:19.165]  Just type in.
[00:54:20.493 --> 00:54:22.533]  White House issues fake terror alerts.
[00:54:22.573 --> 00:54:33.515]  And you'll get not just PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com, you'll get ABC News, you'll get Ari Fleischer, back when he was press secretary, having to admit it when reporters brought it up.
[00:54:34.096 --> 00:54:42.737]  I mean, every time they got in trouble about, oh, tens of billions being given to Enron, or billions being given in no-bid contracts to Halliburton.
[00:54:43.637 --> 00:54:45.298]  I like to say Halliburton, I know it's Halliburton.
[00:54:46.058 --> 00:54:47.218]  It's kind of a joke, folks, but...
[00:54:48.067 --> 00:54:50.248]  And then, oh, suddenly the terrorists are about to strike.
[00:54:50.308 --> 00:54:52.728]  It's an unconfirmed, unsubstantiated report.
[00:54:52.768 --> 00:54:56.289]  We've locked down several major cities and are searching everyone.
[00:54:56.369 --> 00:54:57.389]  Just get used to it.
[00:54:58.589 --> 00:55:03.550]  Tyranny is about private individuals seizing control of government for their own aims.
[00:55:03.610 --> 00:55:10.192]  Why do you think the Chinese generals and why do you think the Mao's of the world and the Stalins and the Hitlers wanted control?
[00:55:11.633 --> 00:55:12.033]  Hello, Mike.
[00:55:12.053 --> 00:55:12.093]  Hi.
[00:55:41.850 --> 00:55:48.292]  Regarding Mena, Mena, who I always get is... DeMendis.
[00:55:48.933 --> 00:55:50.533]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:55:51.013 --> 00:55:55.295]  He was shot seven times in the head as far as I can find out.
[00:55:56.155 --> 00:56:05.859]  And Sir Ian Blair, the head of the Metropolitan Police... They got up to eight, then they said 14 shots were fired, and then now some reports they bring it back down to 12.
[00:56:06.219 --> 00:56:07.960]  But I have articles that say 14 times.
[00:56:08.540 --> 00:56:11.481]  Well, what you've got is probably correct
[00:56:12.886 --> 00:56:29.258]  When I wrote to the Scotland Yard and the Home Office, and I asked if the military had been involved in this shooting, I was thinking of the SAS, they said no.
[00:56:29.899 --> 00:56:33.261]  Under no circumstances were the military involved.
[00:56:33.561 --> 00:56:40.807]  Now what they did after the bombing is they assigned military teams to the police department in police uniform in the anti-terror squad.
[00:56:41.417 --> 00:56:47.099]  Yeah, well, it was because one of my family had previously been in the SAS.
[00:56:48.720 --> 00:56:56.063]  I knew from what he told me that that shooting in the head is an execution military style.
[00:56:56.163 --> 00:56:58.704]  It's not what the police do.
[00:57:00.425 --> 00:57:06.948]  Even Special Branch would not execute people like that.
[00:57:07.392 --> 00:57:10.153]  That is a military execution.
[00:57:10.373 --> 00:57:15.434]  Well, it is, Eddie, but the point is, now it's public that they falsify the reports.
[00:57:15.714 --> 00:57:16.374]  He didn't run.
[00:57:16.434 --> 00:57:17.774]  He wasn't even wearing a jacket.
[00:57:17.794 --> 00:57:19.075]  He was wearing a blue jean shirt.
[00:57:19.535 --> 00:57:20.595]  It was 60 degrees.
[00:57:20.615 --> 00:57:22.335]  They just came up to him.
[00:57:22.415 --> 00:57:23.736]  They sat on him and killed him.
[00:57:24.276 --> 00:57:25.556]  And they knew the whole time.
[00:57:25.616 --> 00:57:26.576]  And why did they kill him?
[00:57:26.596 --> 00:57:27.196]  That's the question.
[00:57:28.897 --> 00:57:33.538]  Besides that, when they followed him from that house,
[00:57:34.608 --> 00:57:37.549]  That he was supposedly ensconced in.
[00:57:38.209 --> 00:57:41.090]  They followed him and they let him get on a bus.
[00:57:41.530 --> 00:57:47.332]  Now if he was a terrorist, terrorists blow up buses in London, as you well know.
[00:57:47.352 --> 00:58:01.777]  So why did they sit behind him on, well, two seats back, while he sat there in front of them, let him get off that bus, let him get onto the street, let him go into the underground,
[00:58:02.705 --> 00:58:08.387]  And then shoot him on an underground... I know, there are just over 50 points.
[00:58:08.447 --> 00:58:09.367]  I'm making a film about it.
[00:58:09.407 --> 00:58:10.648]  That's why I don't know how many points there are.
[00:58:10.668 --> 00:58:16.490]  I mean, we've got one site on Prison Planet that's got hundreds of points on it, but there's 50-plus big points.
[00:58:17.690 --> 00:58:20.951]  Again, it's just one more example of just total lies.
[00:58:20.991 --> 00:58:23.532]  But the lady on the street's like, I'm glad they killed him.
[00:58:23.552 --> 00:58:24.333]  He was running.
[00:58:24.393 --> 00:58:25.113]  No, he wasn't.
[00:58:25.473 --> 00:58:26.153]  Thanks for the call.
[00:58:26.173 --> 00:58:27.774]  I appreciate the call from England, Eddie.
[00:58:28.314 --> 00:58:31.036]  And by the way, I've got a lot of new deals out on my videos and books.
[00:58:31.116 --> 00:58:34.178]  Be sure and check them out at the bookstore at Infowars.com.
[00:58:34.218 --> 00:58:35.119]  Second hour coming up.
[00:58:37.160 --> 00:58:41.463]  Order a copy of this show for your friends and family at GCNlive.com or call 877-300-7645.
[00:58:53.343 --> 00:58:53.983]  Big Brother.
[00:58:54.664 --> 00:58:55.725]  Mainstream media.
[00:58:56.425 --> 00:58:57.546]  Government cover-ups.
[00:58:58.186 --> 00:58:59.007]  You want answers?
[00:58:59.747 --> 00:59:00.648]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:00.668 --> 00:59:05.250]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:05.491 --> 00:59:09.633]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:11.294 --> 00:59:17.938]  Just an incredibly astute, intelligent, piercing, intellect individual joining us.
[00:59:17.978 --> 00:59:22.141]  Webster Griffin Tarbley, historian, investigative journalist, iconoclast.
[00:59:23.164 --> 00:59:26.706]  Author joining us coming up here in just a few minutes.
[00:59:27.607 --> 00:59:31.429]  I got a lot of news about government-sponsored propaganda here domestically.
[00:59:31.469 --> 00:59:33.470]  I don't think people realize the true scope.
[00:59:33.490 --> 00:59:36.332]  It isn't just Armstrong Williams, boys and girls.
[00:59:36.472 --> 00:59:37.853]  It is massive.
[00:59:38.333 --> 00:59:43.757]  And it goes to the heart of this society going from a free society to a high-tech police state.
[00:59:43.797 --> 00:59:45.818]  I mean, you better know America's always bigger and better.
[00:59:45.858 --> 00:59:49.260]  If we have a police state, it ain't going to be pretty, and you can see it forming right now.
[00:59:50.453 --> 00:59:51.213]  So that's coming up.
[00:59:51.913 --> 00:59:53.714]  Let's get a few of these great calls out of the way right now.
[00:59:53.734 --> 00:59:54.594]  I've been holding patiently.
[00:59:54.734 --> 00:59:55.774]  Alan in Connecticut.
[00:59:56.034 --> 00:59:56.674]  Welcome, sir.
[00:59:57.714 --> 00:59:58.114]  Hi, Alex.
[00:59:58.134 --> 00:59:58.494]  How are you?
[00:59:59.135 --> 00:59:59.355]  Good.
[00:59:59.415 --> 00:59:59.715]  Thank you.
[01:00:01.115 --> 01:00:03.335]  I had a question I wanted to ask you.
[01:00:03.575 --> 01:00:06.296]  I just finished reading Webster Tarpey's book about 9-11.
[01:00:06.436 --> 01:00:07.376]  Synthetic Terror.
[01:00:08.276 --> 01:00:08.796]  Great book.
[01:00:09.156 --> 01:00:10.737]  We carry it, by the way, now in the bookstore.
[01:00:10.837 --> 01:00:11.257]  But go ahead.
[01:00:11.897 --> 01:00:13.217]  I'm glad he's on the show today.
[01:00:13.877 --> 01:00:15.837]  In the back, he was talking about Iran.
[01:00:15.857 --> 01:00:19.038]  And I know you and George Norrie were getting into it the other, you know, last week.
[01:00:19.817 --> 01:00:31.102]  And in it he was saying how he had heard that there are quite a few generals now that really don't want to speak of war with Iran because of how much bigger it is in Iraq and how much more they have to lose.
[01:00:31.182 --> 01:00:32.722]  Populations, what, four times?
[01:00:33.483 --> 01:00:34.823]  Oh, it's insane.
[01:00:34.883 --> 01:00:39.445]  And I was wondering, in your opinion, from what you've heard, do you feel that they're starting to
[01:00:41.272 --> 01:00:46.776]  You know what?
[01:00:46.936 --> 01:00:49.517]  That is an absolutely wonderful question for Webster.
[01:00:49.638 --> 01:00:52.359]  I have my answer, but I want you to be able to get his first.
[01:00:52.740 --> 01:00:57.623]  I'm sure it will be the same as mine, because we see the same data, but are very similar.
[01:00:57.643 --> 01:00:58.544]  So I will bring that up.
[01:00:58.604 --> 01:00:59.284]  In fact, I wrote that.
[01:00:59.344 --> 01:01:00.225]  I ran split.
[01:01:00.565 --> 01:01:03.467]  I have that as a note right here for Webster coming up.
[01:01:03.487 --> 01:01:03.907]  Anything else?
[01:01:05.048 --> 01:01:06.069]  Yeah, thank you about that.
[01:01:06.169 --> 01:01:07.430]  And just one more thing, quick.
[01:01:07.450 --> 01:01:09.071]  You know, my grandfather was in World War II.
[01:01:09.091 --> 01:01:09.451]  He was a soldier.
[01:01:10.049 --> 01:01:23.734]  And I always remember him telling me, you know, look, no matter how much we hated the Nazis and the Japanese, we had to know the laws of the Geneva Convention, we had to be able to recite them and follow them, or we would face the same fate as the Nazis.
[01:01:23.854 --> 01:01:25.935]  And he always told me that it was very important
[01:01:26.391 --> 01:01:29.012]  You know, you didn't go around torturing people as much as you hated them.
[01:01:29.132 --> 01:01:31.013]  Hey, Germans had a very low crime rate.
[01:01:31.033 --> 01:01:32.213]  They were good family people.
[01:01:32.253 --> 01:01:35.775]  They were some of the most straight-laced people in Europe, and they turned into pig demons.
[01:01:36.495 --> 01:01:37.736]  And, I mean, that's what happens.
[01:01:37.836 --> 01:01:38.476]  And look at us.
[01:01:38.556 --> 01:01:42.378]  I mean, the Nazis didn't write memos saying we can torture kids in front of their parents.
[01:01:42.418 --> 01:01:43.058]  They just did it.
[01:01:43.518 --> 01:01:45.219]  Only America in modern history.
[01:01:45.279 --> 01:01:50.541]  I mean, Chief Counsel in the White House, John Yoo, is just a... I mean, it's off the charts.
[01:01:51.461 --> 01:01:53.122]  I'll tell you, it's kind of like...
[01:01:54.153 --> 01:01:59.777]  A guy going into a fight with brass knuckles because he can't win, so he kind of has to cheat.
[01:02:00.058 --> 01:02:04.661]  I think America is no longer this superpower, and we know that our economy is crumbled.
[01:02:04.701 --> 01:02:06.062]  Our dollar's not worth anything.
[01:02:06.723 --> 01:02:14.729]  We're about a week away from the total disaster, so we're taking cheap shots to try and get a little edge in, and it's really not even working.
[01:02:16.050 --> 01:02:16.550]  I hear you.
[01:02:16.990 --> 01:02:17.771]  Interesting points.
[01:02:17.831 --> 01:02:20.373]  I'll comment more on your great question after the break.
[01:02:20.413 --> 01:02:20.793]  Thank you.
[01:02:20.833 --> 01:02:22.094]  Let's go to Bob in Texas.
[01:02:22.154 --> 01:02:22.755]  Bob, go ahead.
[01:02:24.181 --> 01:02:24.841]  Yeah, are you there?
[01:02:25.101 --> 01:02:26.642]  Yes, sir.
[01:02:26.682 --> 01:02:30.364]  You're talking about the foreign troops on American soil in New Orleans.
[01:02:30.404 --> 01:02:32.865]  Did you get that Newsweek photocopy I sent you?
[01:02:33.285 --> 01:02:33.846]  Yes, I did.
[01:02:33.886 --> 01:02:38.968]  It was a Chinese communist driver in the car from Newsweek with Bush.
[01:02:39.869 --> 01:02:40.489]  It never ends.
[01:02:40.889 --> 01:02:41.329]  All right.
[01:02:41.389 --> 01:02:42.030]  Well, that was all.
[01:02:42.330 --> 01:02:43.110]  It sounds like freedom.
[01:02:43.170 --> 01:02:44.831]  I mean, what's wrong with communist Chinese?
[01:02:45.612 --> 01:02:50.494]  I don't know, but I don't want to be a sushi dish, that's for sure.
[01:02:51.423 --> 01:02:53.664]  Well, you know, it's in some of my films.
[01:02:53.724 --> 01:02:59.186]  It's in films, take Police State Three Total Enslavement or Road to Tyranny.
[01:02:59.786 --> 01:03:07.489]  Our government signed the deals to, quote, use Mexican and Canadian troops to, quote, deal with American terrorists in America.
[01:03:07.549 --> 01:03:18.833]  I mean, there are signed deals to bring in Czech and Dutch and British and Aussie and Czech Republic troops into America.
[01:03:19.449 --> 01:03:20.429]  I mean, this is public.
[01:03:20.529 --> 01:03:21.190]  This is public.
[01:03:21.230 --> 01:03:22.730]  I've been to the urban warfare drills.
[01:03:23.130 --> 01:03:26.191]  This isn't for Macedonia or Somalia.
[01:03:28.772 --> 01:03:30.252]  But, I mean, foreign troops are here to help.
[01:03:30.312 --> 01:03:31.152]  I mean, look at England.
[01:03:31.252 --> 01:03:33.973]  They're going to have German troops at the World Cup.
[01:03:34.013 --> 01:03:34.473]  Anything else?
[01:03:35.173 --> 01:03:35.633]  That's all.
[01:03:35.673 --> 01:03:36.054]  Take care.
[01:03:36.414 --> 01:03:36.994]  Thank you, Bob.
[01:03:37.014 --> 01:03:41.175]  Yeah, no matter how crazy it sounds, it's a reality.
[01:03:42.075 --> 01:03:44.096]  Because foreign troops will follow orders.
[01:03:44.176 --> 01:03:45.036]  We'll be right back.
[01:03:49.051 --> 01:03:50.552]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:03:50.732 --> 01:03:53.835]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[01:03:53.955 --> 01:03:57.858]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[01:03:57.918 --> 01:04:02.142]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State to the Takeover.
[01:04:02.502 --> 01:04:06.265]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[01:04:06.405 --> 01:04:08.287]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[01:04:08.407 --> 01:04:11.730]  Riot police attacked people on the street indiscriminately.
[01:04:11.770 --> 01:04:12.831]  The medical bills...
[01:04:14.512 --> 01:04:16.473]  Are going to be enormous for me.
[01:04:16.613 --> 01:04:19.655]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[01:04:19.835 --> 01:04:22.717]  They are being led into the Sandpoint brig.
[01:04:23.178 --> 01:04:29.302]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[01:04:29.842 --> 01:04:30.563]  We're good to go.
[01:04:30.583 --> 01:04:31.043]  We're good to go.
[01:04:50.225 --> 01:04:51.286]  The war on terrorism.
[01:04:51.606 --> 01:04:54.389]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[01:04:54.650 --> 01:04:58.814]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[01:04:59.234 --> 01:05:00.075]  So what do you do?
[01:05:00.375 --> 01:05:04.940]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[01:05:05.444 --> 01:05:07.545]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[01:05:08.045 --> 01:05:22.752]  Sheltering in Place, surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[01:05:22.792 --> 01:05:29.916]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[01:05:30.216 --> 01:05:33.357]  Get this critical video every American needs for only $29 plus shipping.

[01:05:49.079 --> 01:05:51.441]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here with an important question.
[01:05:51.681 --> 01:05:53.703]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[01:05:53.863 --> 01:06:00.930]  I mean real hard to find all natural pure soap that contains no dyes, perfumes, deodorants, detergents, or other dangerous toxins.
[01:06:01.190 --> 01:06:09.738]  The Calbin Pure Soap Company, for the past 57 years, has been making triple concentrated pure soaps exclusively for healthcare professionals and hospitals.
[01:06:10.078 --> 01:06:14.764]  Now for the first time, Calvin Pure Soap is available factory direct to you and your family.

[01:06:43.925 --> 01:06:47.146]  Try Pure Soap once and I'll guarantee you'll never use anything else.
[01:06:48.806 --> 01:06:51.447]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:06:51.987 --> 01:06:54.788]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:06:59.309 --> 01:07:10.898]  Webster Griffin Tarpley, historian, iconoclast, investigative journalist, author, will be with us for the next hour and 52 minutes until this broadcast elapses.
[01:07:10.958 --> 01:07:12.840]  It is the 30th day of January, 2006.
[01:07:13.120 --> 01:07:19.705]  Hard to believe that this first month of 2006 has almost elapsed.
[01:07:20.046 --> 01:07:22.127]  Let me just read his bio, because he's just a great guy.
[01:07:22.187 --> 01:07:26.971]  Webster Griffin Tarpley is the author and critic of what he calls the Anglo-American Journal.
[01:07:27.731 --> 01:07:28.531]  We're good to go.
[01:07:28.551 --> 01:07:29.132]  We're good to go.
[01:07:49.522 --> 01:07:53.766]  You can buy copies there as well, but he put it out for free because he loves freedom.
[01:07:54.146 --> 01:08:02.834]  He co-authored American Leviathan, Administrative Fascism Under the Bush Regime in 1991, which identified many tentacles and tendencies which have become prominent today.
[01:08:02.854 --> 01:08:06.017]  And, of course, he exposes the Democrats as owned by the same oligarchs.
[01:08:07.086 --> 01:08:08.387]  And it just goes on and on.
[01:08:08.407 --> 01:08:13.831]  I mean, he's been writing for decades, as far back as 1978, about government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:08:13.851 --> 01:08:18.534]  He helped expose what happened with Project Gladio long before it was declassified.
[01:08:18.574 --> 01:08:28.941]  It's now declassified, admitted that our government carried out over 130 bombings, including blowing up school buses full of children all over Europe, the Bologna bombing of 1980 as well, to blame it on leftists.
[01:08:30.425 --> 01:08:35.251]  And, of course, against oligarchy, a collection of purpley essays and speeches appeared on the Internet in 1996.
[01:08:35.912 --> 01:08:38.695]  His new book, which we are carrying, we just got 300 of them in.
[01:08:39.697 --> 01:08:40.858]  You've got to get this book.
[01:08:40.918 --> 01:08:42.140]  I read it months ago.
[01:08:42.180 --> 01:08:43.401]  It's very, very impressive.
[01:08:43.421 --> 01:08:46.946]  9-1-1 Synthetic Terror Made in the USA.
[01:08:48.243 --> 01:08:54.206]  And it is such an important book for you to get available up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[01:08:54.867 --> 01:08:57.588]  You know, Webster, time always gets away from us.
[01:08:57.768 --> 01:08:59.069]  We're both on the same page.
[01:08:59.109 --> 01:09:02.751]  We just follow the facts, and that's why it leads us to the exact same place.
[01:09:04.052 --> 01:09:11.256]  We know that it is the Dutch and British and Germanic royal families that own the Rothschilds and others like chump change in their pockets.
[01:09:12.497 --> 01:09:13.918]  It's publicly available knowledge.
[01:09:13.938 --> 01:09:22.403]  They own the controlling interest in the defense contractors, biotech, big pharma, in the oil companies, in the shipping companies.
[01:09:22.823 --> 01:09:26.745]  They are now owning the big toll roads, and they're buying up our land.
[01:09:27.885 --> 01:09:33.309]  And they are a bunch of Malthusian social Darwinists who openly say they want to reduce our population.
[01:09:33.369 --> 01:09:46.077]  I want to go into, my friend, who they are, the evidence that's publicly available, and then I want to just get into some of the topical news of the day and get your learned take on it, and then I want to get into 9-11 itself.
[01:09:46.377 --> 01:09:48.239]  But first off, thank you for joining us, my friend.
[01:09:48.259 --> 01:09:49.179]  It's always a pleasure.
[01:09:49.199 --> 01:09:50.280]  Thank you for the invitation.
[01:09:50.780 --> 01:09:51.120]  You bet.
[01:09:51.160 --> 01:09:54.321]  Well, it's great to be carrying your new, because it's the second edition.
[01:09:54.341 --> 01:09:55.061]  It's been out for about a year.
[01:09:55.101 --> 01:09:57.642]  The second edition, even more beefy.
[01:09:58.162 --> 01:09:58.822]  So powerful.
[01:09:59.282 --> 01:10:00.442]  Synthetic terror, though.
[01:10:00.462 --> 01:10:02.103]  I mean, synthetic means man-made.
[01:10:02.223 --> 01:10:04.983]  No naturally occurring ingredients.
[01:10:05.644 --> 01:10:10.045]  It is created at the molecular level.
[01:10:10.105 --> 01:10:12.325]  And this truly is synthetic terror, is it not?
[01:10:12.625 --> 01:10:14.346]  Yes, I think it's synthetic in two ways.
[01:10:14.366 --> 01:10:16.006]  I say it's synthetic because...
[01:10:16.559 --> 01:10:17.800]  First of all, it's artificial.
[01:10:17.980 --> 01:10:20.722]  It's not sociologically created.
[01:10:20.762 --> 01:10:24.944]  In other words, it's not the direct product of political conditions in the world.
[01:10:25.064 --> 01:10:27.265]  It doesn't come from a grassroots organic base.
[01:10:27.325 --> 01:10:27.485]  No.
[01:10:27.806 --> 01:10:30.527]  It comes through the intervention of intelligence agencies.
[01:10:30.567 --> 01:10:41.314]  Without intelligence agencies, secret services, what have you, you generally do not have 95% of the international terrorism and anything spectacular, anything on the scale of 9-11,
[01:10:42.452 --> 01:10:44.933]  It's absolutely dependent on the intelligence agencies.
[01:10:44.973 --> 01:10:50.436]  This was pointed out by my friend, General Ivashov of Russia, in an essay that he sent out.
[01:10:50.476 --> 01:10:54.978]  It happened to get my picture on it in the last couple of weeks.
[01:10:55.018 --> 01:10:57.399]  I was talking to Jack Blood about it last week.
[01:10:57.680 --> 01:11:06.264]  The other thing about synthetic is it brings together disparate elements, different ingredients, different components, and that would be
[01:11:06.914 --> 01:11:08.255]  The moles, right?
[01:11:08.275 --> 01:11:17.798]  We have to have people in the government who are loyal to that private network of oligarchs, aristocrats, bankers, finance oligarchs that you're just mentioning.
[01:11:18.158 --> 01:11:19.498]  You've got to have your patsies.
[01:11:19.518 --> 01:11:27.761]  You've got to have the Atas, the Bin Ladens, and so forth, who really could not exist without the support of intelligence agencies.
[01:11:28.102 --> 01:11:28.942]  Ayatollah Khomeini.
[01:11:29.702 --> 01:11:37.148]  Yes, of course, they have to be assisted, but at the level of these terror operatives per se, I think they're even more dependent.
[01:11:37.188 --> 01:11:38.349]  They couldn't get through the day.
[01:11:38.690 --> 01:11:41.092]  I think that's where Able Danger, by the way, comes in.
[01:11:41.132 --> 01:11:43.414]  Able Danger is the case officers for these people.
[01:11:43.814 --> 01:11:45.916]  And then you've got your trained professionals.
[01:11:45.936 --> 01:11:51.881]  You've got the people who actually do have the ability to bring about these events, be it the Kennedy assassination or 9-11.
[01:11:53.602 --> 01:11:57.604]  And those are people that you hear very little about because they're not ideologues.
[01:11:57.684 --> 01:12:00.086]  They don't come forward to talk in public.
[01:12:00.106 --> 01:12:02.847]  They simply do their deadly work and disappear.
[01:12:02.947 --> 01:12:05.028]  And a lot of times they end up being presidents.
[01:12:05.068 --> 01:12:09.391]  I mean, a lot of the people we see as committee chairmen and presidents are actual hitmen.
[01:12:09.411 --> 01:12:11.592]  I mean, they are actual guys who've done it.
[01:12:12.145 --> 01:12:15.788]  Well, you can certainly say, I could name a couple on the mole level.
[01:12:15.848 --> 01:12:24.414]  I mean, if you look at Senator Specter in the Senate there, remember, he's the author of the magic bullet theory from the Kennedy assassination.
[01:12:24.514 --> 01:12:25.255]  Or George H.W.
[01:12:25.295 --> 01:12:29.818]  Bush, clearly involved in the Kennedy op-ed and photographed on the ground in Big D. Clearly.
[01:12:29.898 --> 01:12:31.419]  So there we go.
[01:12:31.499 --> 01:12:33.421]  So that's a way to get promoted.
[01:12:33.901 --> 01:12:39.445]  Or you can also say that General Shoemaker, or Schoemaker, I think he likes to call himself,
[01:12:40.020 --> 01:12:43.362]  Who was, he's now the head of the Army.
[01:12:43.622 --> 01:12:45.423]  Did the wet work in Waco?
[01:12:45.603 --> 01:12:46.383]  Yes, some of that.
[01:12:46.503 --> 01:12:50.025]  And basically when you have something like September 11th taking place.
[01:12:50.615 --> 01:13:01.301]  You see who gets promoted after that, and then you get a clue as to who's doing... The NORAD general, the NORAD general in control, he suddenly has catapulted the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
[01:13:01.742 --> 01:13:09.506]  Yes, so you basically have this pattern of people being rewarded, and I think that's what I mean by synthetic terror.
[01:13:10.006 --> 01:13:14.129]  My definition of terrorism is false flag, state-sponsored terrorism.
[01:13:14.730 --> 01:13:15.351]  Terrorism.
[01:13:15.611 --> 01:13:31.965]  And I think that the thing that makes my second edition different from the first edition is during the course of 2005, because of information that's come into the public domain, it's easier now, it's more possible to identify the specific military drills
[01:13:32.580 --> 01:13:36.421]  That were used to conduit the 9-11 operations.
[01:13:36.481 --> 01:13:43.503]  In other words, if you say, planes crashing into buildings, well, we know that's the National Reconnaissance Office in Chantilly, Virginia.
[01:13:43.563 --> 01:13:44.944]  That drill was going on that day.
[01:13:45.424 --> 01:13:53.526]  If you say, cruise missile hits Pentagon, you can now immediately relate that to the Amalgam Virgo 01, Amalgam Virgo 02.
[01:13:53.666 --> 01:13:57.388]  And they were having that exact drill at the exact same time, just by accident?
[01:13:57.748 --> 01:14:00.269]  There were 15-plus drills.
[01:14:00.309 --> 01:14:01.729]  Now, it depends on how you count them.
[01:14:02.462 --> 01:14:08.505]  Amalgam Virgo had been a little bit beforehand, but... But four drills that morning that matched the exact targets and times.
[01:14:08.666 --> 01:14:08.966]  More.
[01:14:09.406 --> 01:14:12.548]  I mean, more in the sense of... There's a whole series of drills.
[01:14:12.628 --> 01:14:14.689]  There's the Northern Vigilance, Northern Guardian.
[01:14:15.739 --> 01:14:17.460]  Vigilant guardian, vigilant warrior.
[01:14:17.481 --> 01:14:18.721]  And I want listeners to get something.
[01:14:18.761 --> 01:14:25.426]  Drills of hijacked jets flying to the World Trade Center at Pentagon, going on that day at the exact same time.
[01:14:25.446 --> 01:14:26.747]  I mean, come on, boys and girls.
[01:14:26.767 --> 01:14:28.728]  I mean, the chances of that are just off the charts.
[01:14:29.308 --> 01:14:32.931]  You've also got other, well, some of these are real operations.
[01:14:32.951 --> 01:14:37.974]  The jets that should have been defending New York and Washington were either in Alaska, northern Canada.
[01:14:38.698 --> 01:14:39.519]  Or Iceland.
[01:14:39.739 --> 01:14:42.140]  That was part of the Vigilant Guardian.
[01:14:42.340 --> 01:14:43.301]  And we looked at that.
[01:14:43.321 --> 01:14:46.502]  It had been like four years since that area wasn't defended.
[01:14:46.542 --> 01:14:52.025]  Just magically, the exact day, the planes are never gone, but magically this day they are.
[01:14:52.085 --> 01:14:55.147]  Just hundreds of things perfectly happening right in place.
[01:14:55.407 --> 01:15:00.070]  And then about one-third of the jets from Langley Air Force Base were actually in northern Iraq.
[01:15:00.652 --> 01:15:10.320]  Running that illegal unilateral no-fly zone that had been imposed by the Bush administration, maintained by Clinton, and then maintained by Bush, too.
[01:15:10.761 --> 01:15:15.765]  So you can see that the Iraq question actually had a role in terms of where those jets were.
[01:15:16.185 --> 01:15:17.006]  And that was not a drill.
[01:15:17.026 --> 01:15:20.189]  That was a real operation with real bullets announced.
[01:15:20.289 --> 01:15:22.871]  So I think it's possible to identify those...
[01:15:23.621 --> 01:15:28.805]  Those drills, as the way that it was conduit, and I think... Well, let me stop you there.
[01:15:28.905 --> 01:15:49.078]  On 7-7, we discovered, because they blurped it out on BBC, nobody paid attention, we picked up on it, exact drills, exact same in time and place, exact places that got hit, being run by the former spokesman for Scotland Yard, with the government, at the exact same places, the statistical chance of that, again, has 48 plus zeros on the end of it.
[01:15:49.098 --> 01:15:50.079]  It's always the same.
[01:15:50.199 --> 01:15:52.040]  Why do a drill, Webster?
[01:15:52.240 --> 01:15:53.461]  Well, I'll give my reasons.
[01:15:53.601 --> 01:15:54.261]  It's a cover.
[01:15:54.281 --> 01:16:04.507]  If any of your operatives get caught inside the compartmental governmental structure, oh, it's just a drill, then it's also used as a way to have others stand down because you can tell them that it is a drill.
[01:16:04.588 --> 01:16:05.148]  Other reasons?
[01:16:06.128 --> 01:16:22.278]  Well, I would say when you get to the level of 9-11, or perhaps what is being prepared today to prepare the attack on Iran, you're dealing with terror operations that are so ambitious, so widespread, that they require the use of government assets.
[01:16:22.799 --> 01:16:31.341]  So therefore you have the problem of this coterie of a cabal of treasonous coup d'etat officers and their associates.
[01:16:31.761 --> 01:16:37.602]  They need to run part of their activities through the government, security, and military bureaucracy.
[01:16:37.942 --> 01:16:38.903]  And how do they do that?
[01:16:39.003 --> 01:16:49.285]  And I think the way that they do it is to design a drill that mimics and resembles in just about every way the terrorist action that they wish to carry out.
[01:16:49.773 --> 01:16:56.447]  So that very small changes that can be made at the last minute by just a couple of rotten apples in the entire group.
[01:16:57.356 --> 01:16:59.378]  Can allow the terrorist action to take place.
[01:16:59.658 --> 01:17:00.899]  Just imagine this scene, right?
[01:17:00.919 --> 01:17:04.302]  The military operates based on need-to-know and compartmentalization.
[01:17:04.722 --> 01:17:14.050]  And the people delivering, let's say the Special Forces team is really delivering a real A-bomb to the Super Bowl instead of a dud.
[01:17:14.090 --> 01:17:22.377]  And then, of course, that Special Forces team, as they're extracted and flown back for debriefing, say at Fort Benning, Georgia, their plane goes down.
[01:17:22.397 --> 01:17:22.617]  Okay.
[01:17:22.917 --> 01:17:23.798]  Yes, they liquidated.
[01:17:23.858 --> 01:17:27.240]  I think that's the fate of many participants in this.
[01:17:27.921 --> 01:17:32.625]  You've got to design it so that it's very close, and then you can make the changes at the last moment.
[01:17:32.665 --> 01:17:35.787]  That is, the drill ceases to be a drill, and the drill goes live.
[01:17:36.366 --> 01:17:36.586]  Thank you.
[01:17:36.606 --> 01:17:36.886]  Thank you.
[01:17:55.222 --> 01:17:59.524]  For saying, as you're suggesting, especially now this week, shut down these drills.
[01:17:59.664 --> 01:18:00.385]  We don't need them.
[01:18:00.745 --> 01:18:01.586]  They're expensive.
[01:18:01.706 --> 01:18:04.247]  Even if they go well, they cause destruction.
[01:18:04.287 --> 01:18:05.067]  They're dangerous.
[01:18:05.087 --> 01:18:07.109]  They cause traffic jams.
[01:18:07.209 --> 01:18:14.092]  On their service, it's used to cause fear in the population to have reports about nukes going off.
[01:18:14.473 --> 01:18:21.476]  Is terrorism, by its very nature, it's just a psychological lower level of terrorism like fire in a theater?
[01:18:21.757 --> 01:18:22.137]  Exactly.
[01:18:23.135 --> 01:18:24.115]  Yeah, stay there, Webster.
[01:18:24.175 --> 01:18:26.816]  I want to get into all of this and talk about it.
[01:18:26.836 --> 01:18:28.477]  We're not saying this is going to happen this time.
[01:18:28.937 --> 01:18:30.637]  Also, it wears everybody down.
[01:18:31.497 --> 01:18:45.722]  All these drills create false chatter that then fills the surveillance nets, the NSA and other global scoops or nets, up with the false chatter that can then smokescreen a real op.
[01:18:45.842 --> 01:18:46.782]  That's another facet.
[01:18:51.593 --> 01:18:53.213]  Do you know the truth about breast cancer?
[01:18:53.833 --> 01:18:55.634]  Did you know that the race for the cure is over?
[01:18:56.754 --> 01:19:04.637]  The best kept secret in the country today is that it is now possible to kill cancer without personal suffering, mutilation, and poisoning of your entire system.
[01:19:04.877 --> 01:19:07.497]  Now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaysMed Inc.'
[01:19:07.477 --> 01:19:08.898]  's patented methodology.
[01:19:09.058 --> 01:19:12.399]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation,
[01:19:12.819 --> 01:19:13.440]  We're good to go.
[01:19:13.460 --> 01:19:13.700]  I think?

[01:19:49.381 --> 01:19:53.285]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt.
[01:19:53.505 --> 01:20:05.796]  But the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999, reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking 10.57% annual increase outpacing its previous 10 years.
[01:20:06.216 --> 01:20:06.616]  The U.S.
[01:20:06.656 --> 01:20:12.241]  economy receives its currency by taking on debt through a private banking institution called the Federal Reserve System.
[01:20:12.642 --> 01:20:14.844]  In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%.
[01:20:16.705 --> 01:20:17.185]  We're good to go.
[01:20:37.532 --> 01:20:37.732]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:20:49.289 --> 01:20:50.890]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:20:51.250 --> 01:20:56.993]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[01:20:57.254 --> 01:21:02.376]  The Berkey light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[01:21:02.717 --> 01:21:12.002]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, fried halomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.
[01:21:12.362 --> 01:21:17.304]  It's rechargeable 8-lamp bright white LED lighting system provides the ideal source of emergency light.
[01:21:17.624 --> 01:21:21.646]  The lights can run all night on a single charge and it is bright enough to read by.
[01:21:21.846 --> 01:21:26.609]  This provides a relaxing and ambient night light and allows for optimum use during emergency conditions.
[01:21:26.969 --> 01:21:32.931]  The Berkey Light's revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.
[01:21:33.232 --> 01:21:34.112]  Get the Berkey Light.
[01:21:34.212 --> 01:21:38.358]  The standard of excellence for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and call them Alex Jones sent you.

[01:21:40.081 --> 01:21:41.203]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:21:49.306 --> 01:21:55.068]  Discover a natural way to experience healthier, cleaner indoor air without expensive filters and high-maintenance machines.
[01:21:55.308 --> 01:21:57.789]  Discover what natural health professionals have known for decades.
[01:21:57.949 --> 01:22:00.570]  Natural salt lamps ionize and purify indoor air.
[01:22:00.730 --> 01:22:04.431]  Natural salt lamps come handcrafted from salt crystals that are millions of years old.
[01:22:04.531 --> 01:22:09.633]  These lamps create healthy ions that eliminate odor, reduce bacteria, and can help allergy and asthma sufferers.
[01:22:09.853 --> 01:22:10.274]  We're good to go.
[01:22:32.551 --> 01:22:32.771]  That's 312-224-2710.
[01:22:52.173 --> 01:22:52.673]  Don't worry.
[01:22:53.134 --> 01:22:54.655]  This show is documented.
[01:22:55.175 --> 01:22:57.958]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:22:58.358 --> 01:23:03.442]  I fell into a curtain ring of... We're going to be taking your calls later in the shower.
[01:23:03.462 --> 01:23:06.464]  We're going to get into some of the news headlines like U.S.
[01:23:06.524 --> 01:23:09.006]  plans to fight the net reveal BBC.
[01:23:10.007 --> 01:23:14.910]  And it says they're going to engage in domestic propaganda here in America for our own good, of course.
[01:23:15.450 --> 01:23:21.553]  Having the Pentagon engage in propaganda, which they've always done, but now overtly, that's what freedom is.
[01:23:21.833 --> 01:23:23.574]  No, it's textbook tyranny.
[01:23:24.907 --> 01:23:31.493]  But Webster Tarbly, you know, we knew that back in the late 60s that the 1964 Gulf of Tonkin had been staged.
[01:23:31.513 --> 01:23:32.874]  That had been in major newspapers.
[01:23:33.374 --> 01:23:39.059]  And then a few years ago, right here in Austin, the Presidential Library, LBJ Library and Museum, released the tapes.
[01:23:39.719 --> 01:23:40.880]  We've aired them here on the show.
[01:23:41.521 --> 01:23:48.627]  With McNamara, LBJ's at his ranch talking to McNamara at the Pentagon about how they staged it and how our ships really attacked them.
[01:23:49.287 --> 01:23:49.828]  We're good to go.
[01:24:13.488 --> 01:24:14.128]  We have that.
[01:24:14.168 --> 01:24:15.550]  We have Northwoods, where the U.S.
[01:24:15.570 --> 01:24:20.235]  government said we'll hijack jets by remote control, crash them, blame it on foreign enemies.
[01:24:21.016 --> 01:24:24.079]  We have the USS Liberty was a staged event.
[01:24:24.099 --> 01:24:30.246]  I mean, I've interviewed the admirals who got the call from LBJ saying, I want that ship going to the GED bottom to be blamed on Egypt.
[01:24:32.308 --> 01:24:34.170]  We have our government working with Israel in that case.
[01:24:34.711 --> 01:24:38.675]  Webster, there are so many declassified, admitted examples.
[01:24:38.975 --> 01:24:42.499]  It's not like we're just saying these new events are elements in government.
[01:24:42.759 --> 01:24:44.001]  We have admitted...
[01:24:44.927 --> 01:24:51.232]  I mean, I know you know this, but for some of the audience that may not know, understand, folks, it's like I'm reporting on George Washington or something.
[01:24:51.272 --> 01:24:56.816]  It's like I'm reporting on Martin Luther King giving a speech on the mall in D.C.
[01:24:56.856 --> 01:24:59.078]  It's like I'm reporting on Christmas being a month ago.
[01:24:59.638 --> 01:25:05.563]  I mean, we're just reporting on admitted things like elephants being in Africa.
[01:25:05.583 --> 01:25:10.807]  It's not like we're stretching or trying to confirm something.
[01:25:11.207 --> 01:25:12.408]  Can you comment on that, Webster?
[01:25:12.928 --> 01:25:18.955]  Well, I think we have to look at that record and take some conclusions for the immediate emergency.
[01:25:18.975 --> 01:25:21.258]  In other words, what you're pointing to, I agree with very strongly.
[01:25:21.920 --> 01:25:32.885]  When terrorist events and war provocations, be they military provocations or terrorist provocations, occur, the first prime suspect is always the government involved.
[01:25:32.985 --> 01:25:35.646]  In other words, it's state-sponsored terrorism.
[01:25:35.666 --> 01:25:39.187]  You were mentioning the London 7th of July last year.
[01:25:39.608 --> 01:25:48.651]  They had prepared that at the distance of some months with top-off three, Atlantic Blue and Triple Play, with the U.S., Britain, and Canada being involved in those.
[01:25:48.671 --> 01:25:49.652]  Then on the day of,
[01:25:50.137 --> 01:26:01.728]  We had Peter Power and Visor Associates in those stations at the same time, more or less, and Scotland Yard knew all about it so that they could warn local dignitaries, including Netanyahu.
[01:26:01.828 --> 01:26:04.291]  So we have to draw some conclusions from this, though.
[01:26:04.591 --> 01:26:07.674]  We look at September 11th.
[01:26:08.175 --> 01:26:09.976]  I just wanted to mention Amalgam Virgo.
[01:26:10.016 --> 01:26:10.877]  Some of these things are new.
[01:26:12.306 --> 01:26:14.407]  Newly assembled evidence.
[01:26:14.587 --> 01:26:37.232]  Amalgam Virgo for June 2002, so the one that was being prepared around the time of September 11th, had a Delta 757 with real Delta pilots, but passengers were going to be actors flying from Salt Lake City, Utah, to Honolulu, Hawaii, saying, I am hijacked, and the hijackers were going to be FBI agents posing as terrorists.
[01:26:37.352 --> 01:26:39.533]  Now, remember at the time of
[01:26:40.297 --> 01:26:40.978]  September 11th.
[01:26:41.018 --> 01:26:44.720]  It came out within about a week that Atta and the others had lived on U.S.
[01:26:44.760 --> 01:26:47.302]  military bases, had been trained on U.S.
[01:26:47.322 --> 01:26:47.882]  military bases.
[01:26:47.922 --> 01:26:48.482]  Are you kidding?
[01:26:48.562 --> 01:26:57.268]  The dean of the defense language school, the dean of the most prestigious spy school for language and coding, went public and said, these are agents.
[01:26:57.388 --> 01:26:58.229]  I trained them.
[01:26:58.349 --> 01:26:58.889]  Precisely.
[01:26:58.909 --> 01:26:59.750]  So here's the thing.
[01:27:00.891 --> 01:27:04.874]  I think when we look at that Able Danger group... Hey, we're on the same page.
[01:27:04.914 --> 01:27:07.317]  These are government operatives who thought they were part of drills.
[01:27:07.817 --> 01:27:11.661]  Able Danger is not a group that observes terrorist activity.
[01:27:12.101 --> 01:27:15.664]  Able Danger, in my book, is a group that observes as part of running.
[01:27:15.704 --> 01:27:17.166]  In other words, they're case officers.
[01:27:17.546 --> 01:27:19.428]  They're terrorist controllers.
[01:27:20.649 --> 01:27:30.557]  If you look at how the military runs these drills, you have Able Warrior is generally the largest special forces drill of the year, and it's anti-terrorism, so-called.
[01:27:31.237 --> 01:27:36.181]  They need somebody to play the attack against Able Warrior, and I think that's Able Danger.
[01:27:36.602 --> 01:27:44.428]  So Able Danger is a group of military intelligence people and special forces who have a stable of, quote, Arab terrorists, unquote,
[01:27:46.282 --> 01:27:53.444]  And by the way, we have quadruple nexus on that just from the areas, and obviously you're now more informed than I am.
[01:27:53.464 --> 01:27:57.926]  It looks like you've gone past my knowledge level on this with even more caveats of knowledge.
[01:27:58.186 --> 01:28:02.368]  But clearly, all of these hijackers are in houses with the FBI paying for their houses.
[01:28:03.569 --> 01:28:09.511]  When they can't get back in, the government calls the embassy and says they're government operatives in an anti-terror operation.
[01:28:10.131 --> 01:28:14.313]  They're trained at Pensacola Naval Air Station, a defense language school.
[01:28:14.973 --> 01:28:20.436]  All of this, clearly, they were government agents taking part in what they thought was a drill, Webster.
[01:28:20.476 --> 01:28:20.976]  Stay there.
[01:28:20.996 --> 01:28:25.938]  And now you've come out with some of these amalgam virgo and other drills with the details.
[01:28:26.018 --> 01:28:27.459]  It's just unbelievable.
[01:28:27.859 --> 01:28:35.803]  I mean, folks, on its face, on its face, a bunch of the hijackers trained in a super-secret spy school in Monterey, California.
[01:28:35.883 --> 01:28:38.044]  And the dean goes public and says the government did it.
[01:28:39.285 --> 01:28:40.225]  We're on the march.
[01:28:40.685 --> 01:28:42.186]  The empire's on the run.
[01:28:43.193 --> 01:28:45.887]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:49.483 --> 01:28:53.544]  If the cost of your prescriptions are getting out of control, you want to listen carefully to this.

[01:29:49.122 --> 01:29:51.083]  You've asked for them and now they're here.
[01:29:51.163 --> 01:30:01.888]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Light Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[01:30:02.268 --> 01:30:06.770]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Element.
[01:30:06.850 --> 01:30:18.176]  When used, water flow through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[01:30:18.596 --> 01:30:19.257]  We're good to go.
[01:30:48.456 --> 01:30:50.138]  Here's what one person has to say.
[01:31:08.479 --> 01:31:12.182]  I was feeling chest pain from time to time, shortness of breath.
[01:31:12.322 --> 01:31:16.165]  I don't have the tightness of my chest, and I don't have that shortness of breath no more.
[01:31:16.385 --> 01:31:17.566]  I've tried all kinds of junk.
[01:31:17.766 --> 01:31:18.266]  It didn't do.
[01:31:18.387 --> 01:31:20.408]  The only thing that worked was your cardiovite.
[01:31:20.768 --> 01:31:23.110]  If you believe cardiovite was made for you, call 1-877-928-8822.

[01:32:08.910 --> 01:32:13.053]  Right here on the GCN Radio Network, the Genesis Communication Radio Network.
[01:32:13.253 --> 01:32:17.255]  Often imitated, never duplicated.
[01:32:17.275 --> 01:32:17.896]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:32:19.937 --> 01:32:23.419]  Before we go back to Webster Tarbley, I've had him many times over the years.
[01:32:23.479 --> 01:32:25.781]  I just thought, you know, I've got an online bookstore and video store.
[01:32:26.651 --> 01:32:28.531]  Why don't I just carry Synthetic Terror?
[01:32:28.551 --> 01:32:29.432]  It's such a good book.
[01:32:29.532 --> 01:32:31.092]  And I've read the first edition.
[01:32:31.112 --> 01:32:32.552]  I'm just now reading the second edition.
[01:32:32.572 --> 01:32:34.372]  It's even longer and thicker.
[01:32:35.172 --> 01:32:38.893]  It's 511 pages long.
[01:32:39.533 --> 01:32:45.534]  And it is $17.95 up on Infowars.com on the secure online shopping cart right now.
[01:32:45.854 --> 01:32:55.096]  By the way, you can get my mini-series video, 9-11, Martial Law 9-1-1, Rise of the Police State, that is just a little over three hours long.
[01:32:56.633 --> 01:32:58.915]  You can get it for $29.95.
[01:32:59.215 --> 01:33:03.219]  Now, normally, martial law is $24.95.
[01:33:05.681 --> 01:33:11.867]  So for, what, $5 more, you end up getting synthetic terror.
[01:33:11.987 --> 01:33:14.009]  Yes, if you want synthetic terror by itself.
[01:33:15.270 --> 01:33:18.812]  It is $17.95 and boy, well worth it.
[01:33:18.852 --> 01:33:19.452]  You've got to get it.
[01:33:19.812 --> 01:33:36.683]  But if you haven't gotten Martial Law yet or you want to save a lot of money and you've already got Martial Law, buy Martial Law with Synthetic Terror and save a lot of money on both the DVD and on the book and give the DVD as a gift and then read the book and then give the book as a gift because...
[01:33:38.579 --> 01:33:39.259]  It's real simple.
[01:33:39.500 --> 01:33:41.181]  I lie awake at night thinking about this.
[01:33:41.361 --> 01:33:43.822]  If we don't stop these monsters, they're going for broke.
[01:33:43.842 --> 01:33:44.803]  They're not going to stop.
[01:33:44.863 --> 01:33:49.166]  Again, they've said your pension funds, the bank accounts, your private property.
[01:33:49.606 --> 01:33:51.807]  I mean, this isn't just going to be a tyranny that's partial.
[01:33:51.827 --> 01:33:52.828]  This is going to be total.
[01:33:53.128 --> 01:33:55.910]  They want this tyranny so they can have their way with you.
[01:33:56.270 --> 01:34:01.753]  They're conditioning you that secret arrest and FEMA camps and debtor prisons is good.
[01:34:01.793 --> 01:34:02.854]  They're conditioning you...
[01:34:03.274 --> 01:34:09.139]  For all of this new world order, this neo-feudal fascistic world system.
[01:34:10.379 --> 01:34:15.343]  So please get Synthetic Terror by itself or with my new film, Martial Law.
[01:34:15.403 --> 01:34:17.245]  Martial Law, frankly, I think is my best video.
[01:34:17.685 --> 01:34:25.431]  An hour on the police state, the sound cannons, the microwave guns, the hover blimps, the police threatening to arrest us for asking the general public questions.
[01:34:25.891 --> 01:34:27.492]  A full hour plus on 9-11.
[01:34:29.176 --> 01:34:46.305]  And how the globalists carried it out, and why they carried it out, and Webster and I are a few that have really done the deep research, and he's one of the few people that comes to the same exact conclusions as I do, about the hijackers, the drills, how the globalists did it, from all of the evidence.
[01:34:46.345 --> 01:34:48.966]  So these two, this video and this book, go together nicely.
[01:34:49.366 --> 01:34:58.968]  Then we spend a full, well, almost an hour on the Bohemian Grove, the Skull and Bones, this Nazi-Germanic death cult in the order of death.
[01:34:59.008 --> 01:35:00.249]  So it's three films in one.
[01:35:00.269 --> 01:35:11.772]  You can get the film, the miniseries, a documentary, Martial Law, 9-1-1, Rise of the Police State, with 9-1-1 Synthetic Terror, made in the USA, second edition for $29.95.
[01:35:15.343 --> 01:35:22.865]  Go to Infowars.com to take advantage of this special and to order it off the secure, safe, online shopping cart.

[01:35:55.293 --> 01:35:55.953]  Please take action.
[01:35:56.073 --> 01:36:00.898]  And when you get my videos, you're authorized to make copies for non-profit educational purposes.
[01:36:10.027 --> 01:36:11.408]  That's where the real power is.
[01:36:11.808 --> 01:36:17.011]  You, the listener, getting the video, making 10, 15 copies, giving them to opinion makers in your area.
[01:36:17.451 --> 01:36:18.612]  It is ultra-massive.
[01:36:18.632 --> 01:36:24.115]  I want to commend those that have done it, and I want to ask those that have the videos and haven't made copies to please make copies.
[01:36:24.435 --> 01:36:28.397]  And if you haven't gotten the videos, get them today and expose these murdering terrorists.
[01:36:28.597 --> 01:36:36.982]  Before we get back into 9-11, Webster Tarpley and your incredible book, 9-11 Synthetic Terror, I wanted to specifically...
[01:36:37.705 --> 01:36:43.790]  Specifically talk to you about what the globalists want to build, who they are, what they want to do.
[01:36:43.850 --> 01:36:45.010]  Let's stop talking about 9-11.
[01:36:47.274 --> 01:36:54.540]  For a while, because I want to get into something we haven't talked a lot about on the show, that I see you as one of the foremost experts.
[01:36:54.580 --> 01:36:55.841]  See, I never listen to experts.
[01:36:56.702 --> 01:37:00.385]  What I do is I go out and do my own original research in a wide spectrum.
[01:37:00.926 --> 01:37:05.229]  And mainly I see the trade publications and industry publications is where you'll really learn the truth.
[01:37:05.709 --> 01:37:12.635]  And then I go out and look at others who have the similar, take similar view because they've done good research.
[01:37:12.835 --> 01:37:15.738]  And then I learn even more from the research that you and others have done.
[01:37:16.218 --> 01:37:25.622]  And your research on the British oligarchy, married into the Dutch and the Germanic royal families, the Rothschilds, the Rockefellers, I mean, these really are the people that own and run our society.
[01:37:25.943 --> 01:37:30.965]  I want your expertise on who they are, how their system operates, and what their goal is.
[01:37:31.325 --> 01:37:33.806]  If they have their way, what life's going to be like?
[01:37:34.507 --> 01:37:41.930]  Well, I think you're dealing as the global enemy with finance oligarchs, in other words, financiers,
[01:37:42.994 --> 01:37:48.636]  British and US society is not run by priests or generals or bureaucrats or demagogues.
[01:37:49.116 --> 01:37:57.858]  When you get to the final power, the locus of final power is in the banking system, financiers, Wall Street and the city of London.
[01:37:58.438 --> 01:38:03.939]  And their idea is to create an empire, a worldwide single empire based on that.
[01:38:04.040 --> 01:38:09.641]  Now, there had been some resistance in Western Europe in the past couple of years, but the resistance of France
[01:38:10.228 --> 01:38:23.378]  For the moment has collapsed with Chirac threatening to use nuclear weapons against Iran and the German resistance has also collapsed with the coming of this woman Merkel to be the Prime Minister of Germany.
[01:38:24.345 --> 01:38:30.974]  Right now, I think you have some resistance from disorganized forces in the Arab world, but mainly it's Russia.
[01:38:31.375 --> 01:38:33.257]  That's your resistance force number one.
[01:38:34.599 --> 01:38:36.241]  Those are called rogue states.
[01:38:36.521 --> 01:38:38.504]  Those are rogue states, and then of course China.
[01:38:38.604 --> 01:38:42.109]  So China and what Ivashov has suggested...
[01:38:42.629 --> 01:38:48.192]  Is the Shanghai Cooperation Organization become the nucleus for resistance against this?
[01:38:48.252 --> 01:39:03.059]  Now, this is obviously full of problems because in some ways these systems are not that much better than the Anglo-American one, but just the fact of having opposition and conflict between them would, I think, have some positive effect.
[01:39:03.679 --> 01:39:05.920]  We might be better off with that than any other way.
[01:39:05.960 --> 01:39:10.983]  He wants to have Russia and China be joined by India, Iran...
[01:39:11.542 --> 01:39:11.922]  And others.
[01:39:11.982 --> 01:39:20.269]  But now let's just, in terms of what their plans are, the main script that they're operating from is the Samuel Huntington crash of civilizations from the 1990s.
[01:39:20.769 --> 01:39:22.270]  And he says there are two main enemies.
[01:39:22.290 --> 01:39:33.239]  The Arabs and the Islamic world are an enemy because their population is growing so fast, they threaten to use the resources that the London and New York people want to steal.
[01:39:33.897 --> 01:39:40.623]  And then secondly, you've always got China because of its very high economic development rate, right?
[01:39:40.643 --> 01:39:43.986]  10%, 12%, nothing that can be matched by any country in the Western world.
[01:39:44.046 --> 01:39:48.310]  And then we have to add the Wolfowitz Doctrine of 1992, which says that Russia...
[01:39:50.171 --> 01:39:53.154]  Because if it's military power, we'll always be your enemy.
[01:39:53.194 --> 01:39:53.714]  So there it is.
[01:39:53.855 --> 01:39:58.859]  The Arabs and Islam because of... Let's stop right there, though, and go back to this high-level Russian general who you know personally.
[01:39:58.879 --> 01:40:00.401]  Let's talk about some of his credentials.
[01:40:00.481 --> 01:40:07.507]  And then the paper he put out, which is how the military-industrial complex staged this attack to mobilize their population.
[01:40:07.847 --> 01:40:08.308]  Quite right.
[01:40:08.348 --> 01:40:09.769]  And that's General Ivashov.
[01:40:09.789 --> 01:40:13.493]  General Ivashov is, I think, a patriotic Russian general.
[01:40:13.993 --> 01:40:15.995]  He was the person who seized...
[01:40:16.654 --> 01:40:23.836]  Pristina Airport, back in 1999, when Wesley Clark went nuts and wanted to kick the Russian forces off that airfield.
[01:40:23.856 --> 01:40:25.617]  Well, he wanted to attack them and start World War III.
[01:40:25.637 --> 01:40:26.177]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:40:26.237 --> 01:40:31.618]  And General Sir Michael Jackson sent back to Wesley Clark, I'm not going to start World War III for you.
[01:40:31.879 --> 01:40:37.340]  Let's just remember that General Wesley Clark is Michael Moore's preferred candidate for president.
[01:40:37.380 --> 01:40:40.841]  So that puts a number of things into interesting perspective.
[01:40:41.181 --> 01:40:43.742]  So this is Ivashov, and he basically says,
[01:40:44.511 --> 01:40:59.903]  That the only source for large-scale international terrorism is intelligence agencies, that Al-Qaeda and company cannot be the real source of this because they just don't have the ability, and thirdly, that the only force that does is the U.S.
[01:41:00.423 --> 01:41:00.984]  and the British.
[01:41:01.064 --> 01:41:04.927]  Well, he's diplomatic in the way he puts it, but the idea is the U.S.
[01:41:04.967 --> 01:41:10.671]  and the British, and he says that the desire to have September 11th emerged at the point where
[01:41:11.348 --> 01:41:22.633]  The tensions of the financial system emerge, and what I read into that is the collapse of the dollar, the collapse of the U.S.-British dollar-based banking system, and all the things... Zygmunt Brzezinski said this back in 1997.
[01:41:22.753 --> 01:41:28.196]  Either they go to the next level of tyranny and attack everybody, or the fiat currency system implodes.
[01:41:28.676 --> 01:41:30.278]  Right, the dollar, exactly.
[01:41:30.318 --> 01:41:40.049]  So the whole dollar-based system, and we have to talk about the Iranian oil bourse as a key threat to that, because that is the one strategic thing that Iran offers in the middle of all this.
[01:41:40.069 --> 01:41:42.832]  Okay, now let's stop right there, because I want to digress for a minute.
[01:41:43.433 --> 01:41:49.580]  I mean, I know for a fact, and I've seen the old CIA section chief on History Channel, I'll never forget about five years ago, admit...
[01:41:50.320 --> 01:41:50.941]  We're good to go.
[01:42:12.072 --> 01:42:22.918]  And so when you talk about this bipolar world, how the Arabs aren't great either, but at least it's some impediment or speed bump to this New World Order juggernaut.
[01:42:22.998 --> 01:42:25.079]  Yes, but I see a level above that.
[01:42:25.359 --> 01:42:27.100]  That's why these globalists are such masters.
[01:42:27.200 --> 01:42:28.341]  I see them actually.
[01:42:28.921 --> 01:42:32.903]  I saw a paper five, six years ago where it said the people are going to wake up.
[01:42:33.303 --> 01:42:33.783]  We're good to go.
[01:42:57.677 --> 01:43:02.419]  Well, I'm far from saying that that's any definitive way out of things.
[01:43:02.439 --> 01:43:05.260]  I simply would say, what you've had for the past 15 years is the U.S.
[01:43:05.280 --> 01:43:06.721]  and the British running wild, crushing all
[01:43:24.979 --> 01:43:29.923]  ...resistance, and now the neocons want to take that to the ultimate level of attacking Iran.
[01:43:30.423 --> 01:43:48.557]  When they attack Iran, they're going to kill some of the 3,700 Russians that are there and the Chinese that are there, and I suspect you'll see that the system, even though there are oligarchs on both sides who would like to have a single empire, the idea of a single empire appeals to oligarchs everywhere, even the ones who are going to be the junior partners, but
[01:43:49.036 --> 01:43:51.298]  I think the world is too unstable for that to happen.
[01:43:51.318 --> 01:43:57.443]  In other words, what you've said is... It's the same thing with the Roman Empire, where you'd have the Eastern and Western Empire, and they're always killing each other.
[01:43:58.424 --> 01:44:08.213]  Yes, but I think that the political reality of today's world is richer and more complicated than that, so I wouldn't despair that there's no way out.
[01:44:08.713 --> 01:44:12.236]  And the way out of it always is your own political mobilization, right?
[01:44:12.316 --> 01:44:15.639]  What you as an individual can do, what you can join with others to do.
[01:44:16.482 --> 01:44:17.443]  There's plenty to do.
[01:44:17.804 --> 01:44:21.370]  For example, we have these drills coming up.
[01:44:21.390 --> 01:44:22.832]  We have war drills, terror drills.
[01:44:23.173 --> 01:44:26.098]  How do you stop those from becoming terrorist provocations?
[01:44:26.178 --> 01:44:30.105]  Well, what you do is you denounce them, you expose them, you protest them.
[01:44:30.580 --> 01:44:34.964]  You get ecologists, you can get radical environmentalists to do positive things.
[01:44:35.304 --> 01:44:41.389]  You can get not-in-my-backyard activists to do positive things, saying, we don't want these drills in our area.
[01:44:41.409 --> 01:44:48.635]  So basically, one way or another, by hook or crook, you put light on the cover ops, blow their cover, and then blow their ops.
[01:44:48.775 --> 01:44:48.995]  Right.
[01:44:49.015 --> 01:44:50.696]  These are cockroaches, after all.
[01:44:50.716 --> 01:44:52.578]  You turn the light on, they scurry away.
[01:44:53.298 --> 01:44:54.640]  They don't want the publicity.
[01:44:55.080 --> 01:44:57.442]  Even now, I think there's still ample room
[01:44:57.922 --> 01:45:01.144]  For the role of public opinion and the role of political mobilization.
[01:45:01.164 --> 01:45:04.185]  Because remember, political mobilization has not been tried.
[01:45:04.965 --> 01:45:09.167]  We've had 30 years of stupefied passivity by the vast majority.
[01:45:09.187 --> 01:45:11.028]  Well, more than that, they've got infiltrators.
[01:45:11.508 --> 01:45:19.192]  The minute anybody sticks their head up above ground level, they go, look, they're bad, or look, they're making money, or look, they're... And then we trace them right back to the Pentagon.
[01:45:19.272 --> 01:45:23.114]  And of course, they're conspiracy theorists, too, if you have anything to protest.
[01:45:23.550 --> 01:45:25.371]  But I think that would be the way out.
[01:45:25.511 --> 01:45:29.873]  And I think that there's also a lot of opinion around the world in that direction.
[01:45:29.893 --> 01:45:30.633]  Let me ask you a question.
[01:45:30.673 --> 01:45:32.073]  I mean, I see it as a bigger thing.
[01:45:32.594 --> 01:45:38.356]  Simply exposing the fact, I mean, clearly those Russian mass shootings that's now even come out, those are government ops, too.
[01:45:38.376 --> 01:45:41.017]  It's not like Russia is some sweet little darling, as you were saying earlier.
[01:45:41.037 --> 01:45:41.617]  Clearly not.
[01:45:41.697 --> 01:45:42.938]  No, that's not even the idea.
[01:45:43.078 --> 01:45:43.518]  Sure, sure.
[01:45:43.558 --> 01:45:47.640]  But it's a truly bipolar world, not a monopolar world.
[01:45:48.400 --> 01:45:52.462]  I see it as just having a mass renaissance and awakening to government-sponsored terror.
[01:45:52.723 --> 01:45:53.723]  Who's done it in the past?
[01:45:53.743 --> 01:45:54.864]  Who has the motive now?
[01:45:55.244 --> 01:45:56.285]  Who have we caught doing it?
[01:45:56.305 --> 01:46:02.088]  I mean, look, my point is we've caught these governments, our government, doing it over and over and over again, Webster.
[01:46:02.428 --> 01:46:13.634]  Then, you know, if somebody, let's say, has robbed banks a bunch, and then the person fits the M.O., and we find out they live on our street, the bank robbers should be questioned first, not the whole population.
[01:46:13.934 --> 01:46:16.896]  And so if the government's been caught doing it over and over again...
[01:46:17.919 --> 01:46:20.261]  And they've got the motive, then we should go talk to them.
[01:46:20.281 --> 01:46:21.622]  I agree.
[01:46:21.902 --> 01:46:35.653]  Last July, we had a meeting here in Washington, D.C., at American University, and out of that came the Independent International Truth Commission's drill monitoring function, which has been mediated through a couple of websites.
[01:46:35.774 --> 01:46:38.476]  One is Total411.info.
[01:46:38.536 --> 01:46:41.999]  That gives you a kind of a tabloid version of the drills that may be coming.
[01:46:42.019 --> 01:46:42.679]  That's a good site.
[01:46:42.879 --> 01:46:47.343]  And then if you want to have all the details, right, encyclopedic detail of the drills that are coming,
[01:46:47.754 --> 01:46:50.000]  Team8plus.org.
[01:46:50.081 --> 01:46:53.731]  T-E-A-M, the number 8, P-L-U-S dot org.
[01:46:53.751 --> 01:46:54.834]  And there you have the whole thing.
[01:46:56.697 --> 01:47:03.984]  Let me bring this up to you, Webster.
[01:47:04.805 --> 01:47:09.889]  Most of the government is not evil people, but they're brainwashed, they're compartmentalized, they're very simple.
[01:47:10.350 --> 01:47:12.752]  Just like the general public, they're very naive.
[01:47:13.212 --> 01:47:17.136]  But as this awakening takes place, and I'm seeing an acceleration in the awakening out there.
[01:47:17.196 --> 01:47:18.317]  I mean, I don't know if you're seeing that.
[01:47:18.357 --> 01:47:19.498]  I'm going to get your take on it.
[01:47:19.938 --> 01:47:30.644]  But as we see this awakening take place, isn't it going to get harder and harder for the New World Order crowd to execute these operations because so many of their own people are wise and know what to look for?
[01:47:31.885 --> 01:47:38.729]  Well, I think that's sometimes an unreliable read to lean on because it can't actually be.
[01:47:38.929 --> 01:47:44.692]  There is some institutional resistance inside the federal government structures on the part of
[01:47:45.430 --> 01:47:53.933]  Primarily traditionalists or real conservatives as distinct from fascist neoconservatives who don't share this outlook.
[01:47:53.994 --> 01:47:58.175]  I think there's certainly the possibility that some resistance can come in.
[01:47:58.235 --> 01:48:02.737]  In terms of the bigger picture, I'll just cite you Samuel Huntington, the guy that I just talked about.
[01:48:03.177 --> 01:48:09.720]  Writing back in the early 1980s, and I remember it struck me very much at the time when I saw it, Samuel Huntington
[01:48:10.405 --> 01:48:11.066]  We're good to go.
[01:48:11.086 --> 01:48:12.287]  We're good to go.
[01:48:28.883 --> 01:48:33.104]  A time when people become very focused on the abuses of government.
[01:48:33.144 --> 01:48:35.765]  They're fed up with government overreaching.
[01:48:35.805 --> 01:48:40.486]  They want to go back to equality, freedom, and the other founding values.
[01:48:40.506 --> 01:48:42.667]  And the globalists understand these societal trends.
[01:48:42.687 --> 01:48:44.047]  They're trying to head it off at the pass.
[01:48:44.427 --> 01:48:47.468]  Yes, and that's, of course, what Samuel Huntington is telling you in the 1980s.
[01:48:47.588 --> 01:48:53.869]  He says, well, what we have to do now is get ready to turn that creedal passion period into a dictatorship.
[01:48:54.150 --> 01:48:55.830]  It'll become the opportunity to create
[01:48:56.252 --> 01:48:59.775]  A dictatorial, authoritarian, or totalitarian government.
[01:48:59.795 --> 01:49:05.779]  And I would say we, on the other side, have to be aware that such an upsurge is coming.
[01:49:05.979 --> 01:49:07.741]  You know, that's what I think people don't get.
[01:49:07.761 --> 01:49:09.922]  And I want you to finish here in a second or after the break.
[01:49:09.942 --> 01:49:11.163]  It just sounds like it's a key point.
[01:49:11.984 --> 01:49:18.669]  People have to be aware that globalists, they write books all the time where they call us slaves and talk about taking our rights.
[01:49:19.069 --> 01:49:21.211]  I don't think some of the listeners realize that, Webster.
[01:49:22.020 --> 01:49:22.861]  No, but they do.
[01:49:23.341 --> 01:49:23.681]  They do.
[01:49:23.962 --> 01:49:30.266]  And you can see it in Samuel Huntington's book from the early 1980s, the discussion of the creedal passion period coming up after 2010.
[01:49:31.447 --> 01:49:31.787]  Stay there.
[01:49:32.688 --> 01:49:35.249]  You were saying that we have to realize that and do something.
[01:49:35.269 --> 01:49:36.791]  I want to hear what that something is on the other side.
[01:49:37.151 --> 01:49:42.394]  And we'll take calls a lot more on 9-11 coming up with an amazing individual, Webster Tarpley.
[01:49:42.434 --> 01:49:43.235]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:49:50.618 --> 01:49:53.481]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[01:49:53.741 --> 01:49:54.442]  Hello, my friends.
[01:49:54.542 --> 01:49:55.323]  Alex Jones here.
[01:49:55.663 --> 01:50:00.347]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[01:50:00.668 --> 01:50:07.414]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[01:50:07.734 --> 01:50:09.715]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[01:50:09.916 --> 01:50:12.758]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[01:50:12.858 --> 01:50:17.521]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[01:50:17.721 --> 01:50:22.124]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[01:50:22.364 --> 01:50:29.589]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[01:50:29.849 --> 01:50:32.271]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.

[01:50:49.953 --> 01:50:53.856]  Black Berkey replacement elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[01:50:54.076 --> 01:50:59.520]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[01:50:59.780 --> 01:51:10.147]  Ideal for travel or outdoor events and perfect in the event of hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies because they remove both harmful chemicals and pathogenic bacteria from water.
[01:51:10.327 --> 01:51:14.670]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:51:14.850 --> 01:51:18.473]  Trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine
[01:51:18.693 --> 01:51:23.194]  Benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and NTBE are removed to below detectable limits.
[01:51:23.474 --> 01:51:29.835]  They reduce nitrate and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, aluminum, copper, and foul taste like chlorine and sulfur odors.
[01:51:29.935 --> 01:51:34.416]  Yet the Black Berkey filter elements leave in the helpful and beneficial minerals that your body needs.

[01:51:48.459 --> 01:51:52.601]  Herbal Healer Academy
[01:52:06.667 --> 01:52:07.327]  We're good to go.
[01:52:29.301 --> 01:52:30.102]  We're good to go.
[01:52:30.122 --> 01:52:30.322]  I think?
[01:52:53.900 --> 01:52:56.823]  You've got to be heartless to be able to dominate populations.
[01:52:56.843 --> 01:52:59.985]  But more than just heartless, you have to enjoy it in many cases.
[01:53:00.105 --> 01:53:12.656]  And royals throughout history, it didn't matter whether they were Asian or European or African or American, the Mesoamericans, they just enjoyed mass killing, torture, sacrifice, enslavement.
[01:53:13.157 --> 01:53:14.218]  It was their exercise.
[01:53:14.238 --> 01:53:15.539]  It was an exercise in fear.
[01:53:16.500 --> 01:53:19.541]  And so there was no one there to tell them no or to stop.
[01:53:19.641 --> 01:53:21.762]  And you look at what the globalists say, what they do.
[01:53:22.182 --> 01:53:30.105]  They want to build a world without choice, a world without freedom, and a world in which they want to reduce our populations by 80 to 95 percent.
[01:53:30.165 --> 01:53:31.265]  I mean, this is declassified.
[01:53:31.869 --> 01:53:36.313]  So later in the next hour, I want to talk to Webster about that as well and get into all this domestic propaganda.
[01:53:36.653 --> 01:53:40.436]  I know we have Elijah and Maggie and Brian and Dean and everybody else and Richard.
[01:53:40.616 --> 01:53:42.438]  We're about to go to Maggie, who's been holding for eons.
[01:53:42.498 --> 01:53:53.167]  But, Webster, you were trying to make a point about this revolutionary period against tyranny that some of their big brains were scoping decades ago, and you were saying we need to be aware of that and do what?
[01:53:53.747 --> 01:53:56.550]  Well, you have to have political... First of all, you have to have that perspective.
[01:53:56.570 --> 01:54:00.233]  You've got to think in terms of decades rather than just what's going to work for the next month.
[01:54:01.010 --> 01:54:02.550]  And you've got to have political education.
[01:54:02.651 --> 01:54:13.194]  In terms of political education, I'd just like to cite one thing, was what Bush was going to ask for in the post-9-11 resolution, and this has just come out now in December.
[01:54:14.634 --> 01:54:22.277]  When the 9-11 took place, there was going to be this congressional resolution, and it was going to be the basis of the attack on Afghanistan.
[01:54:22.677 --> 01:54:30.019]  Bush asked the Congress for the power to, quote, deter and preempt any future acts of terrorism or aggression
[01:54:30.541 --> 01:54:31.902]  Against the United States.
[01:54:31.962 --> 01:54:35.443]  Now, that's a very sweeping declaration of war against the universe.
[01:54:35.463 --> 01:54:46.169]  So the Congress said, no, we'll give you all necessary and appropriate force against those nations, organizations, or persons who... I mean, this sounds like the plot of Episode 3, Revenge of the Sith.
[01:54:46.389 --> 01:54:47.829]  Well, let me just give you the last one.
[01:54:48.129 --> 01:54:51.031]  What Bush wanted... Now, this is the most important of these quotes.
[01:54:51.931 --> 01:54:57.494]  Bush asked the Congress to give him, quote, all the necessary to authorize...
[01:54:58.121 --> 01:55:06.527]  All necessary and appropriate force in the United States and against those nations, organizations, or persons
[01:55:07.031 --> 01:55:11.354]  The president determines planned, authorized, committed, or aided 9-11.
[01:55:11.494 --> 01:55:19.560]  And he didn't get that, but now he is, by fiat, declaring the Caesar power and saying, I can do whatever I want.
[01:55:20.100 --> 01:55:25.183]  And John Yoo and his attorney general, Alberto Gonzalez, have written that in memos.
[01:55:25.223 --> 01:55:29.086]  I'm sure you've heard the Yoo clip from the CFR meeting in Chicago.
[01:55:29.706 --> 01:55:30.567]  We'll talk about that then.
[01:55:31.348 --> 01:55:34.770]  These are basically Nazis.
[01:55:34.850 --> 01:55:36.311]  These are followers of Carl Schmitt.
[01:55:37.315 --> 01:55:40.983]  They say that they're inspired by Madison or Hamilton or whatever it is.
[01:55:41.043 --> 01:55:41.885]  It's a lot of baloney.
[01:55:42.492 --> 01:55:54.296]  They're going back to the man that you can only describe as Hitler's lawyer, Carl Schmitt, the guy who gave Hitler advice on how to have a coup in Prussia and then how to have a coup in Germany as a whole.
[01:55:54.316 --> 01:55:57.237]  But for those who don't know, they're saying the president can torture small children.
[01:55:57.277 --> 01:55:58.377]  I mean, it actually says that.
[01:55:58.637 --> 01:55:59.837]  He can commit genocide.
[01:56:00.357 --> 01:56:08.540]  The version, the way that Carl Schmitt summed it up was, if you want to attack your own cities with poison gas to restore order, that's fine.
[01:56:09.489 --> 01:56:13.772]  That's all in my book, the discussion of Carl Schmitt as the model for the neocon.
[01:56:13.792 --> 01:56:15.032]  By the way, that's in U.S.
[01:56:15.052 --> 01:56:19.615]  Code, Title 50, Chapter 32, Subsection 1528, Subsection B. Did you know that?
[01:56:19.635 --> 01:56:20.816]  No, I didn't know that.
[01:56:21.416 --> 01:56:22.997]  Let's take a call from Maggie real quick.
[01:56:23.037 --> 01:56:24.878]  Maggie in Texas, thanks for holding her on the air.
[01:56:24.958 --> 01:56:25.359]  Go ahead.
[01:56:25.379 --> 01:56:26.019]  Hi, Alex.
[01:56:26.979 --> 01:56:34.524]  I was talking to somebody who has contacts within the resident Brazilian community in London.
[01:56:35.237 --> 01:56:40.298]  And who also had happened to be traveling in London around the time of those bombings.
[01:56:40.678 --> 01:56:50.100]  And he said that he had been able to talk to some of de Mendes' circle of friends and acquaintances.
[01:56:50.720 --> 01:56:52.520]  So I asked him what they told him.
[01:56:52.901 --> 01:57:04.763]  And he said, well, one thing that kept coming up was how much he loved his work and how he had always wanted to be an electrician ever since he was a very little kid putting...
[01:57:05.273 --> 01:57:09.056]  We're talking about the gentleman who was shot a whole bunch there in the tube.
[01:57:09.076 --> 01:57:09.676]  Stay there.
[01:57:09.696 --> 01:57:12.859]  We'll let you comment on that and finish up with that when we get back.
[01:57:12.879 --> 01:57:13.459]  Stay with us.
[01:57:13.479 --> 01:57:14.280]  Third hour straight ahead.

[01:57:45.364 --> 01:57:46.005]  Big Brother.
[01:57:46.665 --> 01:57:47.725]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:48.445 --> 01:57:49.566]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:50.206 --> 01:57:51.006]  You want answers?
[01:57:51.766 --> 01:57:52.686]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:53.327 --> 01:57:57.008]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:57:57.508 --> 01:58:01.609]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:13.104 --> 01:58:15.066]  We're good to go.
[01:59:02.939 --> 01:59:04.920]  Hard to believe we're already into the third hour.
[01:59:04.940 --> 01:59:07.582]  And we're going to be taking your calls in this third hour.
[01:59:07.602 --> 01:59:09.643]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:59:10.083 --> 01:59:12.744]  Blasting out on the AM and FM dial across the country.
[01:59:12.824 --> 01:59:14.305]  A growing list of wonderful affiliates.
[01:59:14.705 --> 01:59:18.607]  Simulcasting on the internet at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:59:18.627 --> 01:59:21.129]  We're fighting this earth being turned into a prison planet.
[01:59:21.169 --> 01:59:27.412]  Webster Tarbley, an amazing author, researcher, investigative journalist, joins us today.
[01:59:27.492 --> 01:59:29.453]  And Maggie, been holding for a while in Texas.
[01:59:29.713 --> 01:59:31.094]  Let's bring her back up briefly.
[01:59:32.040 --> 01:59:35.601]  And Maggie, you know, you can bring up the fact that he was a happy young man.
[01:59:35.661 --> 01:59:37.602]  His family said he loved his work as an electrician.
[01:59:37.682 --> 01:59:40.463]  Regardless of all of that, now we know he didn't run.
[01:59:40.923 --> 01:59:42.263]  He wasn't wearing a jacket.
[01:59:42.323 --> 01:59:43.424]  He didn't have bombs.
[01:59:43.764 --> 01:59:49.166]  They sat on top of him and shot him between 8 and 14 times, depending on what report in the head.
[01:59:49.186 --> 01:59:52.827]  And now it's in the news today that the police lied on the reports from day one.
[01:59:53.147 --> 01:59:57.208]  Webster Tarpley, we know the government, that is criminal elements of it, were behind the 7-7 and 7-21.
[01:59:57.228 --> 01:59:58.368]  That's been conclusively proven.
[02:00:00.149 --> 02:00:02.872]  What do you think happened with the Brazilian man?
[02:00:03.853 --> 02:00:07.196]  I don't know, except to say that he was obviously murdered in cold blood.
[02:00:07.656 --> 02:00:12.801]  It's shocking for a country like Britain that has always made such a big deal out of its...
[02:00:13.743 --> 02:00:15.664]  The defense of civil liberties.
[02:00:15.704 --> 02:00:23.548]  In reality, MI5, the British equivalent of the FBI, has pervasive police powers.
[02:00:23.609 --> 02:00:26.410]  It goes far beyond what the FBI has.
[02:00:26.850 --> 02:00:29.772]  And the best authority on this, I think, is David Shaler.
[02:00:29.812 --> 02:00:31.513]  I've had a chance to talk with him.
[02:00:31.593 --> 02:00:32.994]  Yeah, we've had him on, a former MI5 agent.
[02:00:33.194 --> 02:00:35.155]  I've been in conferences with him twice during 2005.
[02:00:35.615 --> 02:00:37.036]  And Andy Michon.
[02:00:37.556 --> 02:00:42.079]  Right, and that's the interesting book, Spies, Lies, and Whistleblowers, I think...
[02:00:42.699 --> 02:00:44.240]  They're in my new film that's coming out.
[02:00:44.280 --> 02:00:51.082]  You can go through the entire story of how the British government has created a police state.
[02:00:51.262 --> 02:00:55.284]  And, of course, now it's come out that Tony Blair was never this little cool hippie on the college.
[02:00:55.564 --> 02:00:57.585]  He was always MI5.
[02:00:57.705 --> 02:01:04.547]  Yes, David Shaler is the source of that report, I believe, on Tony Blair being an MI5 informant and spy.
[02:01:04.607 --> 02:01:06.688]  Isn't it suspicious what happened to DeMendis?
[02:01:07.472 --> 02:01:09.772]  Because we know they like to use Latin Americans as doubles.
[02:01:09.812 --> 02:01:11.213]  It was like they were getting rid of somebody.
[02:01:11.613 --> 02:01:14.093]  Yes, I think that there is a suspicion about this.
[02:01:14.553 --> 02:01:16.534]  We don't know, but regardless, they killed him in cold blood.
[02:01:16.694 --> 02:01:22.295]  Then we have the guy on the airplane in Miami who it turned out hadn't said bomb, was having a panic attack.
[02:01:22.315 --> 02:01:23.135]  They killed him, too.
[02:01:23.675 --> 02:01:25.475]  I mean, are they setting some type of weird precedent?
[02:01:25.895 --> 02:01:30.496]  Well, I think the only way to figure that out is to look at where we stand in terms of the drills.
[02:01:30.556 --> 02:01:34.517]  Now, right now, we're in the final phases of Terminal Fury 06.
[02:01:36.013 --> 02:01:44.490]  Which is a bio-war drill in the Pacific, and we're going into Able Ally in the springtime, which is a NATO drill, and then we get...
[02:01:45.123 --> 02:01:52.129]  Able Warrior, which is that special forces so-called anti-terror... That was used as a cover on 9-11.
[02:01:52.229 --> 02:01:56.573]  Well, I don't know if Able Warrior precisely was going, but Able Danger certainly was.
[02:01:56.633 --> 02:02:02.458]  In other words, the matching component of... And now we know the Able Danger people were trying to give data, and they were saying, hey, back off.
[02:02:03.019 --> 02:02:05.161]  Well, again, I think that there's much more to this.
[02:02:05.201 --> 02:02:10.005]  I think that inside Able Danger there's something called Door Hop Galley that I'd love to know more about.
[02:02:10.618 --> 02:02:16.382]  But somehow there's a component of Able Danger that's actually running the terrorists while they're using... No, I agree.
[02:02:16.442 --> 02:02:17.522]  All the evidence shows that.
[02:02:17.722 --> 02:02:19.523]  Does that answer your question there, Maggie?
[02:02:19.684 --> 02:02:30.690]  No, you didn't let me finish making my point, Alex, which was that electricians have the knowledge of detonators, timers, demolitions, and things like that, and he was probably an expert on those subjects.
[02:02:31.090 --> 02:02:31.691]  No, I hear you.
[02:02:31.731 --> 02:02:35.693]  We just really don't speculate a lot, but obviously the whole thing's suspicious.
[02:02:35.973 --> 02:02:36.734]  You did make your point.
[02:02:36.974 --> 02:02:37.674]  Thank you for the call.
[02:02:37.714 --> 02:02:38.275]  We'll be right back.
[02:02:41.016 --> 02:02:45.342]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:02:45.542 --> 02:02:49.988]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:02:50.109 --> 02:02:54.474]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:02:54.535 --> 02:02:55.896]  The New World Order.
[02:02:57.658 --> 02:03:01.883]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:03:01.943 --> 02:03:08.871]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:03:09.011 --> 02:03:11.014]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:03:11.394 --> 02:03:21.721]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:03:22.001 --> 02:03:27.385]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.

[02:03:42.429 --> 02:03:43.470]  The war on terrorism.
[02:03:43.790 --> 02:03:46.572]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[02:03:46.832 --> 02:03:50.994]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[02:03:51.414 --> 02:03:52.255]  So what do you do?
[02:03:52.575 --> 02:03:57.138]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[02:03:57.631 --> 02:03:59.753]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[02:04:00.234 --> 02:04:14.948]  Sheltering in Place, surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.

[02:04:41.550 --> 02:04:45.918]  Did you know that heart disease is the number one killer of men and women in the United States?
[02:04:46.379 --> 02:04:52.850]  In fact, the National Cholesterol Education Program has reported that each year more than a million Americans have heart attacks.
[02:04:53.308 --> 02:04:53.748]  We're good to go.
[02:05:22.250 --> 02:05:28.276]  At ResearchHerbs.com, we work hard to empower you with the resources you need to make informed health decisions.

[02:05:40.660 --> 02:05:48.346]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show, because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:06:04.309 --> 02:06:09.966]  We're going to go back to Webster Tarpley here in just a moment, talk about his new powerful book, 9-11 Synthetic Terror, the second edition.
[02:06:10.026 --> 02:06:11.952]  More on 9-11 and take your calls.
[02:06:13.570 --> 02:06:19.695]  Don't forget this hour is brought to you by, sponsored by, Calben Pure Soap.
[02:06:19.735 --> 02:06:21.577]  CalbenPureSoap.com.
[02:06:21.597 --> 02:06:25.019]  That's C-A-L-B-E-N PureSoap.com.
[02:06:25.480 --> 02:06:27.501]  They got great free catalogs there.
[02:06:27.561 --> 02:06:28.682]  It's made in America.
[02:06:28.762 --> 02:06:30.084]  No toxins or chemicals.
[02:06:30.144 --> 02:06:36.449]  It's all out of fruits and vegetables and works so much better than the toxic substances that you pay so much for.
[02:06:37.413 --> 02:06:40.915]  And it's a lot less than the organic soaps and things you buy at the grocery store.
[02:06:40.935 --> 02:06:50.579]  At the grocery store, you end up paying more, if you're lucky enough to have it in your grocery store, for organic, high-quality soaps and cleaners than you do for the toxic stuff.
[02:06:50.859 --> 02:06:55.322]  Well, this is less than the toxic stuff and less than the other organic stuff there at the store.
[02:06:55.442 --> 02:06:58.423]  And they've been doing it long before it was trendy.
[02:06:58.883 --> 02:07:00.984]  They've been around since 1947.
[02:07:03.579 --> 02:07:07.529]  So coming up on, what, 60 years here.
[02:07:08.030 --> 02:07:09.374]  They've been around for 59 years.
[02:07:09.414 --> 02:07:09.675]  Cal, Ben...

[02:07:21.261 --> 02:07:22.401]  That's 1-800-340-7091.
[02:07:24.101 --> 02:07:25.842]  Very easy to remember.
[02:07:25.862 --> 02:07:26.442]  1-800-340-7091.
[02:07:26.502 --> 02:07:41.865]  Now, as usual, I'm getting all sped up here today, talking faster and faster, trying to cover all the facets of government-sponsored terrorism or organizational-sponsored terrorism inside of our government
[02:07:42.777 --> 02:07:45.278]  While trying to cover the news and take your calls.
[02:07:45.338 --> 02:08:01.485]  Going back to Webster Tarpley, Webster, we catch the government, the governments of the world throughout history and in modern times, lying premeditatively so many times, caught doing chemical and biological testing on the American people, radiating G.I.'
[02:08:01.465 --> 02:08:08.808]  's babies and killing them cold-bloodedly, but still we just, oh, I'll trust the government, I'll trust the people that run it.
[02:08:10.672 --> 02:08:21.997]  When in reality, really smart serial killers go and join these type of communal hives in government and promote each other into greater and greater positions of power.
[02:08:22.017 --> 02:08:29.240]  So it's kind of like a court of sickos all working in tandem in a communal system.
[02:08:32.078 --> 02:08:39.042]  It's a crew of rogues or pirates feeding on us, but they've got fancy PR teams out front working for them.
[02:08:39.082 --> 02:08:41.003]  So I wanted to bring up some of this news to you.
[02:08:42.362 --> 02:08:48.424]  And get your take on it because I have a whole stack of news on this subject today.
[02:08:48.844 --> 02:09:05.389]  We've all heard of the fake reporters and the Department of Education, Department of Agriculture, Department of Health and Human Services paying all these reporters to go spin or Tommy Frank's 400 grand a year to say he's not being paid to say this but that he loves the war and he loves this and that.
[02:09:06.064 --> 02:09:07.724]  Well, this is out of the BBC, U.S.
[02:09:07.764 --> 02:09:09.725]  Plans to Fight the Net Revealed.
[02:09:10.445 --> 02:09:15.567]  And it says the Pentagon has been, is now going to target websites it doesn't like, people it disagrees with.
[02:09:16.047 --> 02:09:22.529]  And then it says propaganda, just like its Pentagon Office of Strategic Influence, that was announced back in 2003.
[02:09:24.389 --> 02:09:34.672]  This says right here, information intended for foreign audiences, including diplomacy and psyops, psychological warfare, is increasingly consumed by our domestic audience, it reads.
[02:09:35.683 --> 02:09:39.148]  And it goes on to say that this is what they actually want to do.
[02:09:47.799 --> 02:09:48.400]  We're good to go.
[02:09:48.420 --> 02:09:48.560]  I think?
[02:10:09.100 --> 02:10:10.421]  Well, see, that's a whitewash there, too.
[02:10:10.441 --> 02:10:13.724]  They actually ran the papers and killed, not the Lincoln Group, but our military.
[02:10:13.784 --> 02:10:17.907]  Well, they just gave a guy 30 years for writing a bad story about the occupation.
[02:10:17.967 --> 02:10:21.029]  But then they tell us in our media that Iraqi media is free.
[02:10:21.129 --> 02:10:21.910]  Oh, look, they're free.
[02:10:22.310 --> 02:10:23.931]  The stories all supported U.S.
[02:10:23.971 --> 02:10:29.035]  policy were written by military personnel and then placed in Iraqi publications.
[02:10:29.784 --> 02:10:39.991]  And then, of course, we have the gay porn stars at midnight every night at the White House being called on by Bush every time he's in a jam, calling on a special friend.
[02:10:40.531 --> 02:10:42.152]  Give me your take on that, Webster Tarpley.
[02:10:42.652 --> 02:10:55.020]  Well, I can just say, in general, if you go back and look at the framers of the Constitution, they obviously thought that you always have to assume the worst possible motives on the part of anybody in power.
[02:10:55.060 --> 02:10:56.521]  At least you have to be prepared for
[02:10:57.130 --> 02:11:06.295]  For the eventuality that somebody who enjoys large amounts of power is going to be motivated by very bad ideas and motivations.
[02:11:06.795 --> 02:11:08.696]  And this is the whole spirit of the Constitution.
[02:11:09.197 --> 02:11:13.219]  In which you cannot have somebody saying, I'm arrogating to myself absolute power.
[02:11:13.679 --> 02:11:21.723]  It's a funny story, but if the American Constitution seems to have the idea in it, and I think it's a good one, that you have these three impulses.
[02:11:21.763 --> 02:11:24.625]  You have monarchy, oligarchy, and democracy.
[02:11:24.645 --> 02:11:26.666]  And if you look at the branches, the President has a
[02:11:27.190 --> 02:11:34.575]  Monarchical setup, the Senate is oligarchical, the federal judiciary oligarchical, but the House is supposed to be democratic.
[02:11:34.635 --> 02:11:40.480]  The problem that we have today is that they're all oligarchical because of the passivity of the population.
[02:11:40.540 --> 02:11:42.141]  The only way the system works
[02:11:42.857 --> 02:11:45.198]  Is the vigilance and the activism of the citizens.
[02:11:45.238 --> 02:11:52.282]  Well, yeah, the firewalls and the three rations of government have been systematically bought off, paid off, and so the firewalls have been breached.
[02:11:52.322 --> 02:11:57.645]  It's like levees or dams, or a better example is bulkheads on a ship.
[02:11:58.826 --> 02:11:59.807]  And you need reform.
[02:11:59.847 --> 02:12:05.390]  In other words, somehow that oligarchy has got to be rolled back, because you look at Bush, he's not a person.
[02:12:05.430 --> 02:12:08.091]  He's a mouthpiece for a committee of handlers.
[02:12:08.331 --> 02:12:11.353]  And the executive branch, therefore, is an oligarchical...
[02:12:13.024 --> 02:12:20.313]  And you've got the oligarchy in the House of Representatives because the offices are bought and sold, which is the classic definition of oligarchy.
[02:12:20.753 --> 02:12:27.221]  So somehow this is what has got to change unless the original plan is somehow reasserted
[02:12:27.819 --> 02:12:30.861]  Then you're pitching into precisely this kind of abuse.
[02:12:30.881 --> 02:12:35.223]  Well, I just want to say this to the elite minions that are listening, the little servants out there.
[02:12:35.703 --> 02:12:39.425]  You know, we'll talk to them and we'll go, okay, you've been lied to, now they admit they lied to you.
[02:12:40.166 --> 02:12:43.808]  And a day before, their minions will be defending the lie, saying it's true.
[02:12:44.128 --> 02:12:47.349]  Then as soon as this exposes a lie, they go, oh, of course they lied to us.
[02:12:47.710 --> 02:12:48.890]  It's for our own good.
[02:12:49.330 --> 02:12:52.872]  I think so many Americans who serve this system think they're part of it.
[02:12:52.892 --> 02:12:53.913]  Can you speak to that, Webster?
[02:12:54.634 --> 02:13:07.744]  Well, again, if you look back to what Hamilton and Madison and so forth really thought, you don't owe any allegiance to any political party or political faction.
[02:13:08.084 --> 02:13:11.587]  And indeed, they thought that factions would destroy the Constitution.
[02:13:11.647 --> 02:13:13.028]  And maybe that's what we're seeing today.
[02:13:13.068 --> 02:13:20.414]  The Constitution is being destroyed by political parties in the way that Hamilton and Madison thought was the great danger.
[02:13:20.494 --> 02:13:20.594]  So...
[02:13:20.854 --> 02:13:21.274]  We're good to go.
[02:13:41.134 --> 02:13:49.845]  And then now they have this Iraqi general, Seda, this known liar, running around saying that in 85 Bin Laden came there.
[02:13:49.885 --> 02:13:52.849]  Well, he was our ally in 85, same time Rumsfeld was going over there.
[02:13:53.775 --> 02:14:04.397]  And that Saddam shipped the bio and chemical weapons out to Syria, and this is the same crowd that's lied over and over and over again, but now we're supposed to believe them yet again.
[02:14:05.738 --> 02:14:16.180]  Obviously, it's clear that there is an attack on Iran and or Syria, which is now in the final stages of preparation, and I would have to point out, the Democratic Party...
[02:14:16.753 --> 02:14:19.615]  Is as complicit in this as you can be.
[02:14:20.536 --> 02:14:25.180]  One of the main promoters of the attack on Iran is Hillary Clinton, I would say.
[02:14:25.360 --> 02:14:28.963]  Lieberman is obviously, he makes no bones about it.
[02:14:29.023 --> 02:14:38.310]  But Hillary Clinton, Lieberman, and leaders of the Democratic Party And I want conservatives, I agree, I want conservatives to think about a Hillary with all these powers.
[02:14:39.151 --> 02:14:40.953]  Yes, it's quite disturbing.
[02:14:41.153 --> 02:14:45.176]  And I think this is where it's clear that something more than
[02:14:46.910 --> 02:14:58.198]  Well, yeah, I mean, really, they're showing us now, when Bill Clinton comes out and defends the war, and we've known that Bill Clinton and the Bushes have been narcotics trafficking together going back to the 80s.
[02:15:00.500 --> 02:15:04.803]  I think what we have to look at right now is the very grave danger of a war with...
[02:15:05.336 --> 02:15:15.962]  Iran, and that the way in which it's going to happen has been known since last summer, when Cheney instructed the Pentagon, be ready to attack Iran with nuclear weapons and or conventional weapons.
[02:15:16.750 --> 02:15:19.831]  And then have, well, he said, in the wake of a new 9-11.
[02:15:20.191 --> 02:15:23.372]  But the new 9-11 is not something that Cheney's going to wait around for.
[02:15:23.432 --> 02:15:26.313]  He's not going to do rain dances and hope for a new 9-11.
[02:15:26.373 --> 02:15:28.893]  He's obviously going to make sure that it happens.
[02:15:29.133 --> 02:15:35.875]  No, no, he's telling the Pentagon, we're going to be attacked, and we're going to hit them with nukes, and they want to suck us into a war we can't win.
[02:15:36.095 --> 02:15:43.597]  That's why they've got the draft boards set back up, they've got the bills introduced, and every time we mention it, they say conspiracy theory when the draft boards have been set up again.
[02:15:43.878 --> 02:15:49.677]  Well, for the neocons, remember, for the neocons and elitists in general, the only way that you can justify
[02:15:50.211 --> 02:15:54.355]  A hierarchical society run by plutocrats is to have a constant war going on.
[02:15:54.415 --> 02:15:56.517]  Perpetual war for perpetual peace.
[02:15:56.557 --> 02:16:10.310]  The one thing that George Orwell perfectly well identified back in the late 1940s, you've got to have constant warfare or you cannot motivate this kind of a social... And by the way, he was a propagandist for them, boys and girls.
[02:16:10.350 --> 02:16:11.531]  That's why he knew this.
[02:16:11.591 --> 02:16:13.653]  And in the book, the government bombs itself.
[02:16:14.153 --> 02:16:15.256]  To keep the fear up.
[02:16:15.536 --> 02:16:15.757]  Right.
[02:16:15.897 --> 02:16:16.919]  That's a quote you can find.
[02:16:16.960 --> 02:16:21.349]  If you can't find it in the book, you can find it in my 9-11 synthetic terror made in USA.
[02:16:21.409 --> 02:16:22.311]  And you're absolutely right.
[02:16:22.331 --> 02:16:24.917]  He was a British agent who knew whereup he spoke.
[02:16:26.397 --> 02:16:27.778]  I mean, he worked for them all over.
[02:16:27.798 --> 02:16:34.784]  I mean, he was a secret policeman in India, then he was a communist, then he was a BBC propagandist in World War II, and he knew.
[02:16:34.804 --> 02:16:40.809]  Let me just point to one thing which I think is important, which is the nuclear component of all this, just in terms of these drills.
[02:16:41.289 --> 02:16:42.470]  We go back to 9-11.
[02:16:42.630 --> 02:16:44.432]  Most people do not realize that the U.S.
[02:16:44.472 --> 02:16:47.534]  was in total nuclear alert on the morning of 9-11.
[02:16:47.954 --> 02:16:52.098]  You remember in the Cold War, the B-52s used to be in the air, flying around the poles?
[02:16:52.158 --> 02:16:52.318]  Well...
[02:16:53.044 --> 02:17:00.591]  On September 11, 2001, we had something called Global Guardian going from Barksdale Air Force Base, Offwood Air Force Base.
[02:17:01.151 --> 02:17:04.734]  B-1s and B-52s were in the air, loaded with nuclear bombs.
[02:17:05.295 --> 02:17:10.500]  The submarines were in firing positions near the coasts of Russia, China, we have to assume.
[02:17:11.020 --> 02:17:13.002]  The land-based missiles were ready to go.
[02:17:13.627 --> 02:17:25.616]  And in the middle of that exercise, they had a backdoor built in, the case of a rogue insider with access to command and control systems who wanted to launch nuclear missiles apart from the President's authority.
[02:17:25.696 --> 02:17:31.920]  So the invisible government had their own backdoor means of going to nuclear confrontation on the morning of 9-11.
[02:17:32.180 --> 02:17:37.624]  And we're talking General Jack T. Ripper and the precious bodily fluids and everything else.
[02:17:38.184 --> 02:17:38.805]  We'll be right back.
[02:17:41.658 --> 02:17:48.521]  For months now, you've been hearing about the incredible health benefits of Zango, the functional health beverage made from the whole fruit of mangosteen.
[02:17:48.682 --> 02:18:01.608]  What you probably didn't know is that Zango joined forces with the leading manufacturer and distributor of functional health beverages like Capri Sun, Sobe, Mystic, and Red Bull to create the fastest growing business opportunity in America today.
[02:18:01.788 --> 02:18:03.569]  Are you sick of barely having enough money?
[02:18:03.729 --> 02:18:04.249]  We're good to go.
[02:18:22.975 --> 02:18:23.356]  Call 888-203-6633 today!
[02:18:43.331 --> 02:18:44.371]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:18:44.772 --> 02:18:50.254]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[02:18:50.814 --> 02:18:51.314]  That's right.
[02:18:51.634 --> 02:18:53.915]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[02:18:54.475 --> 02:19:01.398]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[02:19:01.969 --> 02:19:09.673]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds, and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[02:19:10.094 --> 02:19:14.956]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[02:19:15.577 --> 02:19:18.599]  If you'd like to take a look at gold free retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[02:19:21.380 --> 02:19:21.641]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:19:42.731 --> 02:19:47.234]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[02:19:47.575 --> 02:19:51.678]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[02:19:51.958 --> 02:19:52.518]  We listened.
[02:19:52.818 --> 02:19:57.802]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[02:19:58.082 --> 02:19:58.563]  We listened.
[02:19:58.943 --> 02:20:01.985]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[02:20:02.405 --> 02:20:02.946]  We listened.
[02:20:03.406 --> 02:20:07.167]  Get the Berkey Light, the American water filter, for only $259 by calling New Millennium
[02:20:33.313 --> 02:20:34.295]  That's toll-free 888-803-4438.
[02:20:34.315 --> 02:20:35.939]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:20:42.509 --> 02:20:46.971]  If you think your engine is safe by having the oil changed every 3,000 miles, think again.
[02:20:47.231 --> 02:20:50.812]  Every time you start your car, your engine creates friction between the moving parts.
[02:20:50.972 --> 02:20:59.095]  These moving parts wear against each other, and the result is small metal particles circulating through your oil, causing premature wear and damage to your engine.
[02:20:59.335 --> 02:21:04.977]  Oil filters do a good job of trapping the large metal particles, but they will not trap the most harmful tiny particles.
[02:21:05.277 --> 02:21:10.519]  These tiny particles circulate constantly through your oil, and over time your engine begins to show signs of wear.
[02:21:10.780 --> 02:21:12.860]  This is why you need the filter mag.
[02:21:13.141 --> 02:21:25.286]  The filter mag is a powerful magnet that holds itself to the outside of your oil filter, trapping the tiny metal particles to the inside wall of the filter, extending the life of your oil and ultimately extending the life of your engine.
[02:21:25.526 --> 02:21:29.928]  The reusable FilterMag is maintenance-free, installed in two seconds, and lasts forever.
[02:21:30.148 --> 02:21:31.108]  So what are you waiting for?
[02:21:31.288 --> 02:21:32.909]  Go to FilterMag.com.
[02:21:33.029 --> 02:21:34.829]  That's FilterMag.com.
[02:21:35.090 --> 02:21:35.550]  Or call 800-345-8376.
[02:21:35.610 --> 02:21:35.790]  That's 800-345-8376.
[02:21:35.830 --> 02:21:36.930]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:21:36.950 --> 02:21:38.311]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:21:49.172 --> 02:21:50.713]  We've got about 35 minutes left.
[02:21:50.733 --> 02:21:52.774]  We've got to really budget our time now.
[02:21:52.794 --> 02:21:56.016]  I know everybody's been holding forever, so let's just start moving these calls quickly.
[02:21:56.116 --> 02:21:59.659]  Elijah in Canada, you're on the air with Webster Tarpley.
[02:21:59.679 --> 02:22:00.059]  Go ahead.
[02:22:01.020 --> 02:22:02.841]  Alex Jones, it is a privilege.
[02:22:03.201 --> 02:22:05.883]  You're a well-respected man in our household.
[02:22:06.723 --> 02:22:07.424]  I'm flattered.
[02:22:07.444 --> 02:22:08.524]  I hope I do a good job.
[02:22:08.564 --> 02:22:11.146]  I know I'm obnoxious, so thank you for having me in your home.
[02:22:11.186 --> 02:22:11.686]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:22:11.886 --> 02:22:13.788]  Yeah, I'd just like to say a couple of things.
[02:22:14.830 --> 02:22:19.753]  Quickly, make a couple of statements and get your comments and maybe make a quote if you give me some time here.
[02:22:20.154 --> 02:22:29.840]  First thing I'd like to say is if people would like to advertise for Alex Jones out there, there's a simple way of just going to a vinyl sign maker, make a little sign on your car.
[02:22:29.860 --> 02:22:32.702]  It says InfoWars.
[02:22:32.762 --> 02:22:37.305]  Make a comment like, do you trust your media or do you trust the government?
[02:22:38.005 --> 02:22:38.606]  Well, you shouldn't.
[02:22:38.826 --> 02:22:40.127]  And go to InfoWars.com.
[02:22:40.907 --> 02:22:41.948]  So there's a little plug for you.
[02:22:42.703 --> 02:22:43.244]  I appreciate it.
[02:22:43.264 --> 02:22:44.285]  A lot of folks are doing that.
[02:22:44.305 --> 02:22:44.645]  Thank you.
[02:22:44.865 --> 02:22:45.726]  Yeah.
[02:22:47.248 --> 02:22:49.830]  I'd just like to make a couple of statements here.
[02:22:49.850 --> 02:22:50.451]  I'll ask you a question.
[02:22:50.471 --> 02:22:54.475]  Have you ever read the book Secret Societies and Subversive Movements?
[02:22:55.876 --> 02:22:57.798]  Originally published in the year 1924.
[02:22:58.359 --> 02:22:59.260]  No, but I've heard about it.
[02:22:59.702 --> 02:23:09.130]  Okay, well, I'd just like to make the connection here because I think that... Well, I mean, all secret societies are the old name of intelligence agencies.
[02:23:09.190 --> 02:23:12.453]  They didn't call them intelligence agencies 150 years ago.
[02:23:12.733 --> 02:23:14.114]  They call them secret societies.
[02:23:14.254 --> 02:23:15.715]  But I want to get Webster's take on that in a minute.
[02:23:15.735 --> 02:23:16.075]  Go ahead.
[02:23:16.115 --> 02:23:16.516]  That's right.
[02:23:17.116 --> 02:23:20.659]  Well, you know, you as well as me, Alex, we're Christians.
[02:23:20.819 --> 02:23:25.603]  And I'd just like to get your take on, you know...
[02:23:27.415 --> 02:23:36.660]  If the Holy Testament says that Lucifer is the god of this world by human choice, then he must have a supreme king in this world.
[02:23:37.241 --> 02:23:53.350]  Now, all the great Christian reformers, like Martin Luther, Tyndale Wycliffe, Jerome Huss, the Calvin brothers, and the list goes on, all these great men declared the ten identifying marks of the prophet Daniel in chapter 7, declared that
[02:23:53.871 --> 02:23:56.932]  The seat of Rome, the papacy, was Antichrist.
[02:23:57.392 --> 02:23:57.693]  Okay.
[02:23:57.813 --> 02:23:59.153]  Listen, I appreciate your call.
[02:23:59.513 --> 02:24:01.154]  I guess, Webster, you want to comment on that?
[02:24:01.174 --> 02:24:03.915]  I really wouldn't have anything to say about that.
[02:24:03.935 --> 02:24:10.918]  I think it would take so long to even begin to deal with those points that I think we'd eat up the whole time and we still wouldn't get an answer.
[02:24:11.661 --> 02:24:13.102]  Yeah, I'm not trying to cut you short.
[02:24:13.122 --> 02:24:21.230]  I mean, if people want me to do some shows on Rome or what's going on there, I mean, obviously any of these big old institutions have got New World Order stuff going on.
[02:24:21.270 --> 02:24:23.312]  I mean, Ratzinger just called for a New World Order.
[02:24:23.692 --> 02:24:25.114]  Pope Benedict is his new name.
[02:24:25.554 --> 02:24:28.817]  But, you know, I don't think that's where it's basically seated.
[02:24:29.498 --> 02:24:31.980]  Let's go ahead and talk to Brian in Pennsylvania.
[02:24:32.000 --> 02:24:33.101]  I've got to move quick now, folks.
[02:24:33.141 --> 02:24:33.762]  Brian, go ahead.
[02:24:34.222 --> 02:24:35.384]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[02:24:35.424 --> 02:24:35.544]  Good.
[02:24:35.584 --> 02:24:36.465]  Can you hear me?
[02:24:36.745 --> 02:24:36.845]  Yes.
[02:24:36.865 --> 02:24:43.193]  The question I had was, where did you get this information where the Germans are going to be at these British sports events?
[02:24:44.704 --> 02:24:52.026]  That has been in mainstream news articles that I saw Paul and Steve post this weekend on presentplanet.com.
[02:24:52.126 --> 02:24:58.508]  It's in an article called, I believe it's Police State Promotion at World Cup.
[02:24:58.848 --> 02:25:03.249]  And in there is a link to a mainstream, I believe it's BBC or Telegraph.
[02:25:03.689 --> 02:25:04.750]  I believe it's London Telegraph.
[02:25:04.770 --> 02:25:05.930]  Actually, it's in the stack right here.
[02:25:05.950 --> 02:25:07.210]  Let me try to dig it out during the break.
[02:25:07.630 --> 02:25:11.631]  And it says there will be German police and troops there helping the British.
[02:25:11.651 --> 02:25:13.392]  And then there will be vice versa.
[02:25:14.392 --> 02:25:24.419]  Yeah, so it takes the load off of them, and actually they'll do the work that the British don't want to do, and they get to have their nice hands on, you know, searching illegally.
[02:25:24.439 --> 02:25:26.580]  That was actually one of the questions I had for Webster.
[02:25:26.820 --> 02:25:28.301]  Webster, I've read the federal documents.
[02:25:28.381 --> 02:25:31.523]  I saw what happened in New Orleans, firefighting in the West.
[02:25:31.803 --> 02:25:38.248]  They really are setting the precedent to use foreign mercs and foreign armies in America and in Europe.
[02:25:38.288 --> 02:25:38.808]  Why is that?
[02:25:40.527 --> 02:25:41.187]  I'm not sure.
[02:25:41.207 --> 02:25:53.077]  I mean, I think my knowledge of the Bundeswehr, the German forces, and of the Italians is that there are people in there who are critical thinkers who might not take part in it.
[02:25:53.097 --> 02:25:54.919]  So maybe they're making a wrong calculation.
[02:25:54.979 --> 02:25:59.963]  I've talked to quite a number of German and Italian officers over the years, and I count some of them among my friends.
[02:26:00.538 --> 02:26:06.662]  And I'm wondering whether that's going to turn out to be a positive gambit for them to play.
[02:26:06.862 --> 02:26:10.324]  Well, it could be German today, Chinese the next.
[02:26:10.364 --> 02:26:13.105]  The point is that there's no reason to have foreign troops.
[02:26:13.365 --> 02:26:17.328]  I think one way you can look at it is General Burns, right?
[02:26:17.348 --> 02:26:26.513]  Kevin Burns was fired last summer when Shoemaker came to him and said, in the army that I'm going to run, we're going to have recruits who are illiterate,
[02:26:26.994 --> 02:26:30.455]  We're not citizens who don't speak English and who have criminal records.
[02:26:30.535 --> 02:26:33.076]  Now, that's the kind of foreign troops I would be afraid of.
[02:26:33.457 --> 02:26:34.177]  Coming in U.S.
[02:26:34.237 --> 02:26:36.998]  Army uniforms, but having those characteristics.
[02:26:37.018 --> 02:26:37.478]  Oh, I agree.
[02:26:37.498 --> 02:26:42.100]  Did you know that 24% of the troops in Baghdad are illegal aliens from Latin America?
[02:26:42.420 --> 02:26:43.361]  I think that's quite plausible.
[02:26:44.361 --> 02:26:46.503]  No, I've seen that number in the Washington Post.
[02:26:46.523 --> 02:26:47.524]  I've seen it several places.
[02:26:47.784 --> 02:26:49.726]  I mean, that is a foreign army right there.
[02:26:49.926 --> 02:26:56.211]  That, I think, is one of the big issues of the traditionalists against the utopians in the military establishment.
[02:26:56.271 --> 02:27:04.498]  Well, they admit now, what, 18% of this year's recruits are at the mean level and are literally a few points lower are mentally retarded.
[02:27:04.538 --> 02:27:05.439]  Have you seen those numbers?
[02:27:05.739 --> 02:27:07.441]  No, but I think, again, it's quite plausible.
[02:27:07.781 --> 02:27:09.603]  No, it's been all over the news.
[02:27:09.643 --> 02:27:10.103]  They've got 80 IQs.
[02:27:12.015 --> 02:27:14.636]  Well, that's exactly what Shoemaker wanted, right?
[02:27:14.676 --> 02:27:16.377]  Shoemaker, who is now the head of the U.S.
[02:27:16.497 --> 02:27:16.737]  Army.
[02:27:17.238 --> 02:27:19.859]  So we've actually got... Folks, that's a moron.
[02:27:20.980 --> 02:27:22.220]  Anything else, Brian?
[02:27:22.240 --> 02:27:23.401]  It was a great point you brought up.
[02:27:23.641 --> 02:27:24.241]  Quick question.
[02:27:24.261 --> 02:27:24.841]  Stay there.
[02:27:24.861 --> 02:27:25.842]  I'll let you ask on the other side.
[02:27:26.082 --> 02:27:26.782]  Folks, I'm not kidding.
[02:27:27.543 --> 02:27:30.084]  They actually are going to have nothing but an army of morons.
[02:27:31.225 --> 02:27:32.165]  We're on the march.
[02:27:32.185 --> 02:27:34.246]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:35.147 --> 02:27:37.828]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:42.463 --> 02:27:50.407]  For thousands of years, the secret of vitality, strength, virility and endurance was kept by the ancient Incas, until now.
[02:27:51.128 --> 02:28:05.676]  Maca, a tuberous plant that only grows in one area of the Andes Mountains, is a functional food and it contains no cholesterol, is rich in vitamins, minerals, fiber, protein, five natural sterols and seven of the nine essential amino acids.
[02:28:06.320 --> 02:28:12.585]  The folks at Vitamir have now made maca available in powder form so that you can experience its nutritional benefits.
[02:28:13.246 --> 02:28:14.547]  Call 877-817-9829 to order maca today.
[02:28:18.462 --> 02:28:23.925]  Maca also contains tannins, flavonoids, alkaloids, and fatty acids not found in other foods.
[02:28:24.526 --> 02:28:27.627]  Try Maca and you'll know the secret of the ancient Incas.
[02:28:28.048 --> 02:28:28.308]  Call 877-817-9829.
[02:28:28.348 --> 02:28:30.089]  That's 877-817-9829 and order your Maca today.
[02:28:30.329 --> 02:28:30.569]  Maca.
[02:28:30.589 --> 02:28:32.070]  Now you'll know the secret.
[02:28:41.201 --> 02:28:42.842]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:28:42.962 --> 02:28:47.083]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[02:28:47.203 --> 02:28:50.084]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[02:28:50.164 --> 02:28:56.846]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[02:28:57.046 --> 02:29:00.028]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[02:29:00.269 --> 02:29:02.650]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[02:29:02.790 --> 02:29:12.918]  Like murky elements, not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as aptazine, benzene, chloride, and chloroform.
[02:29:13.398 --> 02:29:15.620]  Or order on the web at BerkeyWater.com.
[02:29:40.970 --> 02:29:42.072]  You don't love me anymore.
[02:29:42.392 --> 02:29:44.215]  You used to take such good care of me.
[02:29:44.235 --> 02:29:45.697]  Is that my car talking to me?
[02:29:45.838 --> 02:29:46.118]  Yes.
[02:29:46.439 --> 02:29:47.280]  You neglect me.
[02:29:47.440 --> 02:29:49.423]  Change my oil late most of the time.
[02:29:51.266 --> 02:29:52.288]  Use the cheapest gas.
[02:29:52.588 --> 02:29:53.490]  I'm getting sick.
[02:29:53.810 --> 02:29:55.974]  One of these days, I'm just gonna give up.
[02:29:57.034 --> 02:29:57.495]  Wait a minute.
[02:29:57.595 --> 02:29:59.215]  I've got three more years of payments on you.
[02:29:59.456 --> 02:30:08.020]  If you want me to last forever, you need to add protected engine treatment, protected transmission treatment, and especially protected complete fuel system treatment.
[02:30:08.480 --> 02:30:13.943]  Protected unique synthetic fortifiers treat the metal and the oil to reduce friction like no other.
[02:30:14.163 --> 02:30:16.564]  Okay, I'll add some protecta, but you'll have to perform.
[02:30:16.704 --> 02:30:21.365]  How about faster acceleration, more horsepower, longer lasting.
[02:30:21.585 --> 02:30:23.246]  I'll always be there for you.
[02:30:23.446 --> 02:30:26.767]  So if you want more, treat it right with Protecta by SFR.
[02:30:26.927 --> 02:30:31.308]  For a special offer of free shipping, go to www.sfrcorp.com or call 888-USE-SFR1.
[02:30:31.388 --> 02:30:32.689]  That's www.sfrcorp.com or call 888-USE-SFR1.
[02:30:47.188 --> 02:30:51.332]  Mr. Tarpley, I've got to have this guy back up again soon for two hours.
[02:30:51.372 --> 02:30:54.754]  You get the two of us together, it's just things really move fast.
[02:30:54.774 --> 02:31:01.180]  But that's the mark of good radio to hopefully compel you to think about what's happening in the world.
[02:31:01.200 --> 02:31:04.102]  We're so honored that you're joining us today, all of you.
[02:31:04.603 --> 02:31:08.386]  Before we go back to the calls, 911 Synthetic Terror made in the USA.
[02:31:09.706 --> 02:31:13.410]  We've got a really good deal on it for you, and we hope that you'll get it.
[02:31:13.450 --> 02:31:22.337]  It's $17.95 for a copy of this 511-plus page book.
[02:31:22.437 --> 02:31:25.320]  Second edition that really isn't baloney.
[02:31:25.360 --> 02:31:28.723]  I mean, it gets into what really happened on 9-11 with the facts.
[02:31:28.803 --> 02:31:32.046]  It meshes with my analysis and adds even more evidence to it.
[02:31:32.086 --> 02:31:34.268]  I've made three films about 9-11, written a book.
[02:31:34.848 --> 02:31:43.930]  And published another book, and I'm making another film right now that 9-11 is part of, but it's mainly about other terrorist events in history and in modern times.
[02:31:44.470 --> 02:31:45.510]  But that film isn't out yet.
[02:31:45.550 --> 02:31:48.430]  I hope you'll get 9-1-1 Synthetic Terror, made in the USA.
[02:31:49.110 --> 02:31:51.331]  Or you can get it with my new film, Martial Law.
[02:31:51.391 --> 02:31:52.451]  It's really a miniseries.
[02:31:52.471 --> 02:31:54.931]  The Police State 9-11 and the Globalist Master Plan.
[02:31:55.272 --> 02:31:58.572]  Three one-hour films on one DVD.
[02:31:58.652 --> 02:31:59.572]  My best work yet.
[02:32:00.032 --> 02:32:02.073]  You get that with Synthetic Terror for $29.95.
[02:32:04.540 --> 02:32:08.525]  Normally, the new film, Martial Law, is $24.95 by itself.
[02:32:08.605 --> 02:32:13.550]  So for $5 more, folks, you're getting Synthetic Terror.
[02:32:14.091 --> 02:32:18.836]  Or you can look at it the other way and say for $5 more, you're getting the Martial Law film.
[02:32:19.691 --> 02:32:22.412]  So that film and the book together in a combo.
[02:32:22.852 --> 02:32:24.773]  Infowars.com.
[02:32:24.893 --> 02:32:30.195]  Get it today or get the book individually at Infowars.com or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[02:32:31.556 --> 02:32:38.899]  We're going to PrisonPlanet.tv and see all my films, my weekly TV reports.
[02:32:38.919 --> 02:32:41.540]  This one, Best of Austin, by the way, best TV show in Austin, the Austin...
[02:32:41.960 --> 02:32:42.941]  Chronicle Reader's Poll.
[02:32:42.961 --> 02:32:44.002]  I'm pretty flattered.
[02:32:44.042 --> 02:32:46.925]  Some years it's the UT football game, other years it's Austin City Limits.
[02:32:47.265 --> 02:32:49.247]  I'm not tooting my horn, but it's a pretty good TV show.
[02:32:49.567 --> 02:32:52.630]  And now we're doing a new feature where every week I have guests in studio.
[02:32:52.690 --> 02:32:53.451]  This week it's going to be...
[02:32:54.544 --> 02:32:55.345]  We're good to go.
[02:32:55.385 --> 02:32:55.925]  We're good to go.
[02:33:21.110 --> 02:33:24.012]  Monthly and yearly subscriptions at prisonplanet.tv.
[02:33:24.032 --> 02:33:28.936]  And if you'd like to write to me to order videos or books, it's 3001-3001 South Lamar, L-A-M-A-R, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[02:33:29.076 --> 02:33:31.618]  And you can read for free online because he's so gracious.
[02:33:38.349 --> 02:33:45.771]  At his website, you can go to Mr. Tarpley's website, and you can read his definitive work on George Herbert Walker Bush, Sr.
[02:33:46.191 --> 02:33:52.613]  We need to have Tarpley up for a couple hours sometimes just to cover that, because his knowledge is so encyclopedic, pun intended.
[02:33:53.153 --> 02:33:58.394]  And, of course, his website, going from memory here, what is it, Tarpley.net, Mr. Tarpley?
[02:33:58.414 --> 02:33:59.174]  Tarpley.net.
[02:33:59.535 --> 02:34:04.236]  That's right, Tarpley.net, and that is T-A-R-P-L-E-Y.
[02:34:04.256 --> 02:34:04.936]  I think that's...
[02:34:05.396 --> 02:34:09.144]  I think that's the oldest continuous anti-Bush dynasty website in the world.
[02:34:09.204 --> 02:34:13.634]  In October of this year, it will have been up there for ten years, giving you that book for free.
[02:34:14.460 --> 02:34:19.864]  Now, I want to go back to the calls quickly and go to Brian, Dean, Paula, Christopher, and Richard.
[02:34:19.884 --> 02:34:23.607]  That'll be it for calls because there's so much to cover in the time we've got left.
[02:34:23.627 --> 02:34:28.891]  But before we go back to these calls, any other key points that you think the listeners need to understand?
[02:34:29.672 --> 02:34:32.033]  Well, I think that you've got to look ahead to these drills.
[02:34:32.394 --> 02:34:34.836]  We were just talking about Global Guardian, right?
[02:34:34.876 --> 02:34:36.557]  That was the one on the morning of 9-11.
[02:34:37.538 --> 02:34:38.378]  After the U.S.
[02:34:38.759 --> 02:34:43.162]  changed the military posture to preemption, to nuclear sneak attack,
[02:34:43.809 --> 02:34:58.455]  Between August and November of last year, Global Guardian was rebaptized Global Storm, Global Lightning, and that included war games, meaning nuclear war, Armageddon against Russia and North Korea.
[02:34:58.515 --> 02:35:00.236]  That was all drilled out last fall.
[02:35:00.776 --> 02:35:05.839]  And now we're heading into one called Global Thunder, which is set up for the springtime.
[02:35:05.899 --> 02:35:08.580]  So we're looking right now at Able Ally...
[02:35:09.179 --> 02:35:15.281]  Able Warrior, which is Special Forces, and Global Thunder, which is Stratcom, which is nuclear.
[02:35:15.321 --> 02:35:16.662]  Able Ally being NATO.
[02:35:17.022 --> 02:35:26.385]  And to be clear, I have no doubt that the globalists have it in their power and their will to carry out strategic attacks in America to be blamed on foreign enemies.
[02:35:26.586 --> 02:35:27.466]  And that's exactly it.
[02:35:27.486 --> 02:35:30.387]  So when something goes off, don't think bin Laden.
[02:35:30.427 --> 02:35:32.068]  Don't think caves in Afghanistan.
[02:35:32.128 --> 02:35:33.028]  Think Dick Cheney.
[02:35:33.428 --> 02:35:35.951]  And you will be much closer to the truth, I'm sure.
[02:35:35.991 --> 02:35:39.376]  Well, he said in PNAC documents we need helpful terror attacks.
[02:35:39.496 --> 02:35:42.019]  And he repeated it again to the Pentagon last summer.
[02:35:44.847 --> 02:35:50.692]  We're on the verge of grave danger of contrived terrorist provocations going off.
[02:35:50.872 --> 02:35:51.713]  And I want to be clear.
[02:35:51.893 --> 02:35:52.954]  They carry on the attack.
[02:35:52.994 --> 02:35:54.255]  They get the national draft.
[02:35:55.516 --> 02:35:59.379]  It's about capturing America more than it is about capturing Asia.
[02:35:59.419 --> 02:36:04.143]  It's about, if they have a martial law police state in place, they can then take the pension funds.
[02:36:04.503 --> 02:36:09.868]  Well, I'm afraid some of them, you know, people, when Hitler came to power, a lot of financiers said, oh, that's just Hitler, we'll control them, and then a lot of them...
[02:36:29.006 --> 02:36:29.687]  We're good to go.
[02:36:46.249 --> 02:36:48.851]  There hasn't been anything like that since 1945.
[02:36:48.931 --> 02:36:52.234]  Why is Iran making inflammatory comments?
[02:36:52.374 --> 02:36:57.398]  Why is their president, in my view, falling right into the hands of the globalists?
[02:36:57.438 --> 02:37:06.105]  Is he looking at Kim Jong-il threatening to nuke us or Chinese generals threatening to nuke us on a weekly basis and thinking, well, that Saddam tried to play ball and he got taken out?
[02:37:06.666 --> 02:37:08.047]  Is he trying to take the opposite tack?
[02:37:08.567 --> 02:37:10.649]  I would condemn Ahmadinejad.
[02:37:10.729 --> 02:37:13.211]  I think Ahmadinejad is an incompetent.
[02:37:13.251 --> 02:37:14.092]  I think he's a fool.
[02:37:15.021 --> 02:37:24.613]  The only thing we have to remember, though, is that Iran has been threatened repeatedly for a year and a half to two years by the US, by the British, and by the Israelis, left and right.
[02:37:24.934 --> 02:37:26.876]  Blood-curdling threats at least once a week.
[02:37:27.337 --> 02:37:29.379]  So what he has said is really simply...
[02:37:30.296 --> 02:37:31.996]  Turnabout in regards to that.
[02:37:32.016 --> 02:37:35.697]  I know, but he's still falling into their hands, and that's why I agree with you that he's incompetent.
[02:37:35.717 --> 02:37:37.838]  But everybody gasped.
[02:37:37.918 --> 02:37:40.258]  They said, if you bomb our country, we'll fire back.
[02:37:40.278 --> 02:37:41.878]  And everyone's, can you believe it?
[02:37:41.918 --> 02:37:43.739]  If we attack them, they'll fight back.
[02:37:43.759 --> 02:37:45.299]  Have you ever heard of such evil?
[02:37:45.539 --> 02:37:50.840]  That's like if somebody comes to your house and beats your wife in front of you, and you say, I'm going to punch the robber.
[02:37:51.020 --> 02:37:53.041]  And they go, he's going to punch the robber.
[02:37:53.101 --> 02:37:53.861]  He's bad.
[02:37:54.501 --> 02:37:54.981]  I would agree.
[02:37:55.001 --> 02:38:03.106]  And it's clear that in this case, the aggression is very unlikely to come from... I mean, how can the average American buy into that, that it's bad to fight back if you're attacked?
[02:38:04.046 --> 02:38:05.027]  I don't think it's possible.
[02:38:05.067 --> 02:38:08.088]  I mean, I think there's only a tremendous propaganda brainwashing.
[02:38:08.128 --> 02:38:10.190]  Remember that acts of war are going on now.
[02:38:10.710 --> 02:38:14.712]  The acts of war include the British are sending terrorists into southern Iran.
[02:38:15.205 --> 02:38:16.406]  To blow up refineries.
[02:38:16.446 --> 02:38:18.027]  There was one off last week.
[02:38:18.047 --> 02:38:19.328]  They've killed dozens of people.
[02:38:19.748 --> 02:38:27.212]  And these are British-trained terrorists from Basra that are being sent across the border with the tasking of blowing things up.
[02:38:27.232 --> 02:38:28.153]  There are overflights.
[02:38:28.213 --> 02:38:28.934]  There are teams.
[02:38:29.334 --> 02:38:31.255]  There are acts of war going on all the time.
[02:38:31.495 --> 02:38:33.777]  By the way, it's declassified.
[02:38:33.817 --> 02:38:40.841]  They admit that our government, because BP said so, went in with Kermit Roosevelt in 1953 and bombed mosques all over the country and blamed it on Mosaddegh.
[02:38:41.101 --> 02:38:47.164]  Well, now you have the Arabistan or Ahvaz province with a liberation front.
[02:38:47.224 --> 02:39:00.711]  I call it the BP liberation front because the goal of this liberation front is to take the Iranian oil wells and put them back under British control where they were until Mossadegh came along and nationalized them back in the time that you say.
[02:39:01.532 --> 02:39:02.512]  So I think that's it.
[02:39:02.652 --> 02:39:05.574]  And people have got to get to the point where they're sophisticated enough
[02:39:06.121 --> 02:39:12.525]  Not to be stampeded by synthetic terror into accepting something that's going to be the beginning of the Third World War.
[02:39:12.625 --> 02:39:13.326]  You know, it's incredible.
[02:39:13.566 --> 02:39:21.631]  I mean, Dick Cheney and others say, we'll nuke you, we'll kill you, we'll blow your cities up, and then they say the same thing back, and it's like, can you believe them?
[02:39:21.671 --> 02:39:25.814]  We said we'll nuke them, and they said they'll fight back with little conventional rockets.
[02:39:26.094 --> 02:39:28.296]  We said we'll bomb them, and they said they might fight.
[02:39:28.596 --> 02:39:30.898]  I've never heard of something so evil.
[02:39:31.238 --> 02:39:35.381]  And I think it's very important for traditionalists and conservatives inside the U.S.
[02:39:35.421 --> 02:39:35.921]  military,
[02:39:36.421 --> 02:39:41.385]  To make their voices heard now, in any way that they can, that this should not take place.
[02:39:41.445 --> 02:39:48.049]  There is no reason for this, and it is an act of incalculable folly to court war with Iran.
[02:39:48.089 --> 02:39:49.570]  You know, you call it folly.
[02:39:49.610 --> 02:39:52.011]  I think the globalists want to get us into something really rough.
[02:39:53.012 --> 02:39:57.795]  Well, again, I think they're stupid, incompetent people.
[02:39:57.835 --> 02:39:58.896]  They calculate wrong.
[02:39:59.352 --> 02:40:00.833]  They think they're conquering the world.
[02:40:00.893 --> 02:40:03.054]  I don't think they're going to conquer the world ever.
[02:40:03.614 --> 02:40:18.340]  See, I think the globalists above them, and I've seen the documents on this, are letting America play the part of the bad cop right now, grab what assets they can, then the globalist minions hand it off to their bosses in Europe, and then America takes the blame, and then the whole program just moves forward.
[02:40:18.620 --> 02:40:24.363]  It could well be, but I think the imperative thing to see right now is that the people who are going to carry this out in the U.S.
[02:40:24.403 --> 02:40:24.843]  military...
[02:40:25.416 --> 02:40:30.761]  Are going to be in an extraordinarily critical situation, and there is no reason for this, and it should not happen.
[02:40:30.941 --> 02:40:31.642]  Well, I agree with you.
[02:40:31.682 --> 02:40:34.144]  MRSA is saying, obviously, that they're in total civil war.
[02:40:34.525 --> 02:40:38.809]  They have Woodruff, the ABC anchor, getting shrapneled in bad condition.
[02:40:39.149 --> 02:40:41.851]  I mean, that place is imploding.
[02:40:42.152 --> 02:40:46.676]  And then I read an Israeli document in 1983 saying they want it in three to four parts, broken up.
[02:40:47.076 --> 02:40:47.717]  That's the goal.
[02:40:47.757 --> 02:40:50.279]  I read Pentagon documents, P2OG saying that.
[02:40:50.519 --> 02:40:51.200]  But then I ask.
[02:40:51.360 --> 02:40:55.383]  Has it gotten even worse than what the Pentagon wanted?
[02:40:55.903 --> 02:41:04.329]  Well, the plan is a punitive expedition of destroying certain scientific areas with the nuclear conventional bombing and liberation fronts.
[02:41:04.369 --> 02:41:05.970]  Remember, they've got Iran today.
[02:41:05.990 --> 02:41:13.855]  They're going to make that into Balochistan, Turkmenistan, Arabistan, Azerbaijan, Kurdistan, and then...
[02:41:14.517 --> 02:41:16.318]  So it's the same thing.
[02:41:16.378 --> 02:41:16.938]  It's the same thing.
[02:41:16.998 --> 02:41:20.539]  Breaking up Iraq into three to four parts, breaking up Iran into three or four parts.
[02:41:20.579 --> 02:41:27.461]  It's a stated goal, and our governments have people in there bombing them, admittedly, right now, and then they're supposed to just sit there and take it.
[02:41:27.861 --> 02:41:29.522]  And that's the Bernard Lewis plan.
[02:41:29.562 --> 02:41:30.422]  Well, I agree.
[02:41:30.542 --> 02:41:31.502]  No, no, they should take it.
[02:41:31.823 --> 02:41:39.085]  If our government nukes them, they should say thank you, and they should never talk back, and they should accept being shot and killed, and I think that they're evil.
[02:41:39.605 --> 02:41:45.328]  Well, if you don't want peace, then you're in effect choosing war, and then all of the terrible effects of war.
[02:41:46.029 --> 02:41:53.233]  And in modern times, we see that when you go into a war, you never can calculate... Well, how dare Iran not want the British in their bombing things right now?
[02:41:53.253 --> 02:41:53.933]  I mean, what's wrong with it?
[02:41:53.953 --> 02:41:54.634]  That's friendly.
[02:41:55.714 --> 02:42:03.739]  Well, the British forces in southern Iraq are, as one of their admirals said a couple of weeks ago, Sir Alan West,
[02:42:04.306 --> 02:42:12.010]  You said we should not allow the attack on Iran to take place, because if it does happen, the British forces in Basra can be virtually wiped out.
[02:42:13.251 --> 02:42:16.633]  And I think that would extend to all of the foreign forces in Iran.
[02:42:16.653 --> 02:42:19.334]  But see, I think it's going to be like with Japan and the 10-part plan.
[02:42:19.354 --> 02:42:22.556]  They mean for the forces to get rolled back, and it looks bad.
[02:42:22.916 --> 02:42:23.817]  America's getting whooped.
[02:42:23.977 --> 02:42:25.077]  Oh, a nuke just went off.
[02:42:25.117 --> 02:42:25.758]  They just hit us.
[02:42:25.878 --> 02:42:26.979]  We've got to get in there now.
[02:42:26.999 --> 02:42:28.519]  Come on, America.
[02:42:29.260 --> 02:42:30.801]  We're going to get caught holding now.
[02:42:30.841 --> 02:42:33.042]  I'm going to send my kids off and get blown to bits.
[02:42:34.065 --> 02:42:37.008]  Well, all the more reason not to go down this path, I would say.
[02:42:37.048 --> 02:42:37.428]  You know what?
[02:42:37.468 --> 02:42:39.109]  We're on the edge of Armageddon, folks.
[02:42:39.169 --> 02:42:40.070]  I just hope you know that.
[02:42:40.731 --> 02:42:43.513]  And these phony, bought-off churches are on the government payroll.
[02:42:43.533 --> 02:42:44.674]  They're telling you it's all great.
[02:42:45.375 --> 02:42:47.116]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[02:42:47.136 --> 02:42:48.778]  Brian, finish up your question quickly.
[02:42:48.798 --> 02:42:49.238]  I've got to move.
[02:42:49.258 --> 02:42:49.658]  I'm sorry.
[02:42:50.099 --> 02:42:51.200]  Go ahead, Brian.
[02:42:51.220 --> 02:42:56.964]  The second question I have was, did you hear the stories about the Homeland Security informing the bank with...
[02:42:58.255 --> 02:43:03.297]  Nothing is allowed with the banks that are in these state deposit boxes?
[02:43:03.837 --> 02:43:15.981]  Yeah, I don't know about that particular thing that's out there on the web, but I do know under Homeland Security rules that they will seize your state deposit boxes, and they did it in 1933 with the War Powers Act.
[02:43:17.201 --> 02:43:18.262]  So none of this is new.
[02:43:18.522 --> 02:43:19.222]  Thanks for the call.
[02:43:19.742 --> 02:43:21.003]  Let's talk to Dean in Illinois.
[02:43:21.043 --> 02:43:21.763]  Dean, you're on the air.
[02:43:21.803 --> 02:43:22.143]  Go ahead.
[02:43:23.288 --> 02:43:23.528]  Hello?
[02:43:23.888 --> 02:43:24.169]  Yes, sir.
[02:43:24.589 --> 02:43:26.470]  Sir, it's an honor and a pleasure to meet you.
[02:43:26.771 --> 02:43:27.972]  It is not an honor.
[02:43:28.032 --> 02:43:28.972]  It's an honor to talk to you.
[02:43:29.012 --> 02:43:29.393]  Go ahead.
[02:43:29.413 --> 02:43:29.813]  Okay.
[02:43:30.594 --> 02:43:34.337]  I just wanted to talk to you about gun control.
[02:43:34.437 --> 02:43:35.998]  I think it's called propaganda.
[02:43:37.586 --> 02:43:39.047]  We're good to go.
[02:43:39.087 --> 02:43:40.068]  We're good to go.
[02:44:07.466 --> 02:44:09.346]  I have a comment from Webster Tarpley on that.
[02:44:09.446 --> 02:44:10.887]  I would go with the Constitution.
[02:44:11.347 --> 02:44:15.448]  The right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be impaired as long as it's well regulated.
[02:44:15.788 --> 02:44:16.528]  That's all you need.
[02:44:16.868 --> 02:44:17.588]  All right, go ahead.
[02:44:18.288 --> 02:44:19.129]  Anything else, caller?
[02:44:19.689 --> 02:44:27.650]  Yes, and I have a friend who was debating with a school teacher, and the school teacher was making him look like a fool because he was arguing for guns.
[02:44:29.331 --> 02:44:29.791]  No, he was...
[02:44:30.660 --> 02:44:32.321]  Well, I mean, look, you have a mafia.
[02:44:32.441 --> 02:44:33.482]  You have a mafia.
[02:44:34.542 --> 02:44:38.605]  If you're there in Chicago and own mob boss running things, do you think the mafia wants you to be armed?
[02:44:38.625 --> 02:44:39.585]  Nope.
[02:44:40.246 --> 02:44:49.071]  I mean, your state is not issuing the gun owner cards and then coming and arresting people when the state itself didn't issue the cards.
[02:44:49.111 --> 02:44:54.174]  And the state has ruled, it doesn't matter if we're the ones that didn't issue the cards, we're still going to come arrest you.
[02:44:55.975 --> 02:44:59.857]  So it's their fault, and then you get arrested.
[02:45:01.024 --> 02:45:02.326]  Yes, I totally agree with you.
[02:45:02.907 --> 02:45:03.868]  Dean, it's disgusting.
[02:45:03.908 --> 02:45:05.190]  How do you listen to us in Illinois?
[02:45:05.210 --> 02:45:06.993]  How do I listen to you?
[02:45:07.253 --> 02:45:07.514]  Yes, sir.
[02:45:09.997 --> 02:45:11.379]  I know we have a lot of affiliates there.
[02:45:11.560 --> 02:45:12.801]  I was wondering what AM station.
[02:45:12.842 --> 02:45:13.863]  Listen, I appreciate your call.
[02:45:14.444 --> 02:45:15.285]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:45:15.305 --> 02:45:16.467]  What is it?
[02:45:17.925 --> 02:45:19.247]  I forget the name.
[02:45:19.567 --> 02:45:20.788]  You know, it's okay.
[02:45:21.249 --> 02:45:24.572]  Listen, I forget to ask the listeners what station they're listening to, so thanks for the call.
[02:45:24.933 --> 02:45:28.096]  I'm just really excited to have, what is it, four or five stations now in Illinois.
[02:45:28.676 --> 02:45:30.198]  You know, Webster, I go back to this.
[02:45:30.278 --> 02:45:31.399]  It's the best news we've got.
[02:45:31.980 --> 02:45:33.021]  I don't put on an act here.
[02:45:33.081 --> 02:45:35.704]  I just am a real guy with real news, with real guests.
[02:45:36.384 --> 02:45:38.987]  And so many stations are turning us on.
[02:45:39.428 --> 02:45:41.550]  So many mainstream people are now listening.
[02:45:42.010 --> 02:45:46.435]  So many people, I mean, frankly, I don't find hardly anyone that disagrees anymore.
[02:45:46.695 --> 02:45:49.598]  It's like people instinctively know that we're in deep trouble.
[02:45:50.493 --> 02:45:52.854]  I think so, and I have to congratulate you on your growth.
[02:45:52.914 --> 02:46:02.079]  You're a great voice and a great cause, and people need to be made aware and educated, and you've done a tremendous contribution on that in the past several years.
[02:46:02.099 --> 02:46:02.839]  Well, let me just say this.
[02:46:03.740 --> 02:46:05.381]  I can't hardly listen to myself sometimes.
[02:46:05.421 --> 02:46:06.741]  Sometimes I listen, it sounds great.
[02:46:06.761 --> 02:46:07.562]  Sometimes it doesn't.
[02:46:08.562 --> 02:46:09.303]  I'm not arrogant.
[02:46:09.343 --> 02:46:10.343]  It sounds like I'm arrogant.
[02:46:10.363 --> 02:46:11.984]  I'm just upset and aggressive.
[02:46:12.504 --> 02:46:16.266]  But I think people know, they can tell that it's genuine what I'm saying, what I'm doing.
[02:46:16.286 --> 02:46:17.447]  They check out what we say.
[02:46:18.187 --> 02:46:19.428]  But it isn't about Alex Jones.
[02:46:19.468 --> 02:46:23.290]  To have so many people listening to me is very, very humbling, Webster.
[02:46:23.570 --> 02:46:24.891]  But it also gives me hope.
[02:46:24.931 --> 02:46:28.593]  And I laid in bed last night thinking, man, I want to do a good job tomorrow.
[02:46:28.653 --> 02:46:30.674]  I want to make sure Webster gets to make all his points.
[02:46:30.754 --> 02:46:32.835]  I want to try to cover all the news.
[02:46:32.915 --> 02:46:36.577]  But, I mean, do you ever get the feeling of frustration that there's so much evidence, Webster?
[02:46:37.377 --> 02:46:39.538]  Well, sometimes it becomes overwhelming.
[02:46:39.578 --> 02:46:40.459]  I think it's important...
[02:46:41.488 --> 02:47:05.841]  It's important to have information, but beyond the information, there has to be a philosophical method, in other words, a way of looking at the world and an understanding of the main things that are going on right now, which I think are a very severe economic and financial depression, financial crisis everywhere, and that somehow that is fueling this drive towards police states, totalitarian, authoritarian regimes, and towards a new world war.
[02:47:05.881 --> 02:47:08.122]  And if you can keep all that, and I think you do,
[02:47:08.989 --> 02:47:11.471]  And people need to hear about it every day in new forms.
[02:47:11.531 --> 02:47:17.514]  Then I think you can put all the various facts that come in every day into their proper perspective.
[02:47:17.534 --> 02:47:17.934]  Exactly.
[02:47:17.954 --> 02:47:20.715]  You've got to have the proper lens or it's all just garbage.
[02:47:21.136 --> 02:47:23.357]  Once you know the program, once you know the goal...
[02:47:23.857 --> 02:47:25.938]  Because people think, well, why do they want a police state?
[02:47:25.998 --> 02:47:26.518]  What for?
[02:47:26.578 --> 02:47:31.099]  Well, number one, they're going to own the private companies that they give bids to themselves.
[02:47:31.519 --> 02:47:32.560]  It's corporate welfare.
[02:47:32.600 --> 02:47:37.001]  Number two, they want to do a lot of horrible things financially to you that they know you're not going to put up with.
[02:47:37.281 --> 02:47:39.022]  Number three, they want power and control.
[02:47:39.282 --> 02:47:40.642]  Number four, they're gangsters.
[02:47:40.682 --> 02:47:44.143]  They want to be armed to protect themselves against all the other gangsters.
[02:47:44.163 --> 02:47:45.404]  That's why they want a world government.
[02:47:45.704 --> 02:47:47.584]  I mean, they want to secure and expand their power.
[02:47:48.124 --> 02:47:49.985]  I would say also in regard to Iran today,
[02:47:50.485 --> 02:47:54.328]  Since 1945, the only way you could get oil was by having dollars.
[02:47:54.968 --> 02:48:00.292]  Now, if Iran opens this oil bourse, you're going to be able to do that with euros, or I think with other currencies, too.
[02:48:00.533 --> 02:48:01.453]  Maybe even with gold.
[02:48:01.493 --> 02:48:02.654]  You're talking about a mercantile!
[02:48:03.034 --> 02:48:07.658]  I'm talking about the Iranian oil bourse, so that you can buy it in some other way.
[02:48:08.174 --> 02:48:11.315]  So you don't have to go to London, you don't have to go to New York, or one of their brands.
[02:48:11.335 --> 02:48:14.636]  By layman, you mean no longer will the petrodollar be a dollar?
[02:48:15.076 --> 02:48:22.038]  Yes, you'll have a petroyuro competing with the petrodollar, and that at least gives people the chance to play one against the other, so they're somewhat better off.
[02:48:22.918 --> 02:48:25.519]  And now we have China dumping the dollar incrementally.
[02:48:26.983 --> 02:48:29.327]  It's all very, very serious, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:48:29.347 --> 02:48:33.173]  Meanwhile, the cops want to pull you over and search your car while the border is wide open.
[02:48:33.233 --> 02:48:35.316]  It's just absolutely ridiculous.
[02:48:35.857 --> 02:48:38.441]  They're looking for drugs that the government shipped in to begin with.
[02:48:42.549 --> 02:48:45.391]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[02:48:45.651 --> 02:48:46.352]  Hello, my friends.
[02:48:46.452 --> 02:48:47.232]  Alex Jones here.
[02:48:47.572 --> 02:48:52.255]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law, 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[02:48:52.596 --> 02:48:59.340]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[02:48:59.660 --> 02:49:00.361]  We're good to go.
[02:49:29.480 --> 02:49:32.164]  Or watch the film right now online at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:49:42.057 --> 02:49:42.698]  We're good to go.
[02:50:05.799 --> 02:50:15.540]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[02:50:15.660 --> 02:50:24.522]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[02:50:24.782 --> 02:50:28.083]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5.
[02:50:30.183 --> 02:50:34.905]  by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[02:50:36.846 --> 02:50:39.627]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:50:39.827 --> 02:50:49.112]  Herbal Healer Academy is a global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.
[02:50:49.332 --> 02:50:51.593]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.
[02:50:51.773 --> 02:50:58.136]  We provide outstanding products like Esiac, Colloidal Silver 500 parts per million, Olive Leaf Extract,
[02:50:58.516 --> 02:50:59.117]  I think so.
[02:51:14.028 --> 02:51:14.368]  We're good to go.
[02:52:00.032 --> 02:52:01.493]  All right, folks.
[02:52:01.533 --> 02:52:03.415]  We're back live talking to Webster Tarpley.
[02:52:04.696 --> 02:52:06.777]  Christopher in Michigan, you're on the air.
[02:52:06.837 --> 02:52:07.538]  Go ahead, my friend.
[02:52:09.839 --> 02:52:14.303]  I'd like to say thank you to all listeners, you, Alex, and your guest here.
[02:52:14.363 --> 02:52:15.023]  Thank you very much.
[02:52:16.264 --> 02:52:17.105]  That's it, Christopher?
[02:52:17.905 --> 02:52:19.026]  That's all I have to say.
[02:52:19.066 --> 02:52:20.988]  Everyone who's listening, they know what's up.
[02:52:21.068 --> 02:52:23.349]  They're going to be the best fighters in this fight.
[02:52:24.470 --> 02:52:26.572]  Either with them or against them.
[02:52:27.212 --> 02:52:28.093]  Ridiculous.
[02:52:28.333 --> 02:52:29.214]  Thanks, everybody, for
[02:52:31.608 --> 02:52:33.669]  Thank you, Christopher.
[02:52:33.989 --> 02:52:44.594]  Webster, isn't it becoming ridiculously obvious, though, how many times you've caught them lying, how many things they've done, all the bid-rigging and war profiteering and the Democrats all being owned by the same people?
[02:52:44.654 --> 02:52:48.656]  I mean, aren't Americans really being given a choice right now like we never have before?
[02:52:48.896 --> 02:52:50.216]  It's being made so obvious.
[02:52:50.917 --> 02:52:57.900]  I think especially on this question of the relation of drills and terrorism, this is the time when that kind of education can really...
[02:52:58.573 --> 02:52:59.394]  Make a difference, right?
[02:52:59.434 --> 02:53:04.057]  We've seen, for example, the attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan.
[02:53:04.658 --> 02:53:10.062]  There was a White House presidential succession drill of the Nine Lives series being done.
[02:53:11.062 --> 02:53:17.387]  We had Hilek 75, which was a possible nuclear confrontation with the Soviets.
[02:53:18.028 --> 02:53:24.753]  We had Abel Archer 83, which was so realistic, the Soviets thought it was the real thing and went to red alert.
[02:53:24.773 --> 02:53:26.174]  Then we've had London on 7-7.
[02:53:26.214 --> 02:53:27.415]  We've had September 11th.
[02:53:28.331 --> 02:53:39.636]  We know that if terrorist provocations come, there's a very high probability that they're going to be conduited and bootlegged through the military and security apparatus of the government.
[02:53:40.036 --> 02:53:41.436]  And that's what you have to look for.
[02:53:41.496 --> 02:53:44.918]  So you've got to go to those websites, and there are volunteers who do this.
[02:53:44.958 --> 02:53:47.419]  There are citizen sort of observers.
[02:53:48.632 --> 02:53:53.294]  Who find out these things, put them up on the web, denounce them, expose them.
[02:53:53.354 --> 02:54:02.877]  And again, these drills are key because they use it as operational cover with the compartmentalization inside the government because they have to use government assets.
[02:54:02.997 --> 02:54:05.258]  It's a telltale sign, a key indicator.
[02:54:05.898 --> 02:54:07.759]  Let's go ahead and talk to Paula in Florida.
[02:54:07.779 --> 02:54:08.499]  Paula, go ahead.
[02:54:08.519 --> 02:54:09.159]  Hi, Alex.
[02:54:09.199 --> 02:54:11.880]  I'll tell you, hon, you have every right to be angry.
[02:54:11.900 --> 02:54:15.441]  I mean, everybody's, you know, they've become just like you.
[02:54:15.481 --> 02:54:16.902]  I mean, you are helping so many.
[02:54:17.342 --> 02:54:20.807]  And we're having everybody get a hold of your program.
[02:54:21.107 --> 02:54:23.590]  We're calling radio stations trying to get you on with them.
[02:54:24.331 --> 02:54:27.015]  And I'll tell you what, guys sure have got to stand up and fight.
[02:54:27.155 --> 02:54:28.777]  That's all there is to it, just like that gentleman said.
[02:54:29.478 --> 02:54:30.059]  And if we don't,
[02:54:30.481 --> 02:54:32.601]  It's all going to be over with, but I think we have the power.
[02:54:32.641 --> 02:54:33.662]  There's more of us than there are of them.
[02:54:34.262 --> 02:54:39.463]  Well, unfortunately, I'm a Christian myself, but so many of the churches have been bought off by the federal government and other groups.
[02:54:39.523 --> 02:54:42.063]  They tell people, lay down, don't get involved.
[02:54:42.303 --> 02:54:45.624]  That's the complete opposite of what the Bible teaches.
[02:54:45.764 --> 02:54:46.764]  Webster, comments on that?
[02:54:47.484 --> 02:54:53.905]  I think so, and I think you can forget about the usual political categories of left and right, because those don't work.
[02:54:54.566 --> 02:54:56.726]  You have an opposition among...
[02:54:57.327 --> 02:55:02.790]  Conservatives, you have an opposition among libertarians, and also among leftists, quite frankly.
[02:55:03.110 --> 02:55:03.611]  Exactly.
[02:55:04.431 --> 02:55:08.193]  Groups that have never... Because this is forcing people to grow up.
[02:55:08.614 --> 02:55:12.736]  This is forcing people to get past all these terms and get right down to the nitty-gritty.
[02:55:12.776 --> 02:55:17.519]  We've got a corrupt elite that's out of control, that's gotten away with so much they think they're bulletproof.
[02:55:17.979 --> 02:55:18.680]  We're good to go.
[02:55:47.458 --> 02:55:52.903]  We have a deal where it also goes with the new film, Martial Law, for $15 along with it.
[02:55:53.744 --> 02:55:54.284]  Great deal.
[02:55:54.704 --> 02:55:56.646]  So that's up on InfoWars.com.
[02:55:56.666 --> 02:55:59.368]  We're going to PrisonPlanet.tv to see the videos online.
[02:55:59.589 --> 02:56:02.091]  Webster, thank you so much for spending two hours with us.
[02:56:02.311 --> 02:56:02.891]  My pleasure.
[02:56:02.931 --> 02:56:03.612]  See you soon.
[02:56:03.832 --> 02:56:05.153]  I'll be waiting for you to call.
[02:56:05.914 --> 02:56:07.115]  Keep up your amazing work.
[02:56:07.175 --> 02:56:08.356]  Viacom Dios.
[02:56:08.416 --> 02:56:09.597]  Folks, he is so on.
[02:56:09.617 --> 02:56:13.060]  There's so many other 9-11 researchers that get a lot of it right, but not all of it.
[02:56:13.080 --> 02:56:14.001]  I mean, he is just...
[02:56:14.882 --> 02:56:17.004]  Exactly on target with my analysis.
[02:56:17.464 --> 02:56:18.205]  Take care, folks.
[02:56:21.127 --> 02:56:25.711]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-376-45.
