[00:00:01.574 --> 00:00:08.697]  Prepare yourself for a talk radio experience like no other.
[00:00:08.817 --> 00:00:10.257]  Strap yourselves in.
[00:00:10.337 --> 00:00:11.218]  Hold on.
[00:00:11.618 --> 00:00:13.298]  He stands for truth.
[00:00:13.318 --> 00:00:14.119]  Defending our borders.
[00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:16.220]  He stands for justice.
[00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:18.180]  Fighting the American Union.
[00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:19.981]  He stands for what's right.
[00:00:20.541 --> 00:00:22.282]  This is explosive talk radio.
[00:00:23.102 --> 00:00:25.303]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:26.218 --> 00:00:29.959]  Call Alex now, toll free at 877-590-5525.
[00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:37.600]  Now live from Austin, Texas, here's Alex Jones.
[00:00:40.621 --> 00:00:41.801]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:41.861 --> 00:00:46.142]  I'm glad that you have joined us on this live Sunday edition.
[00:00:46.282 --> 00:00:49.962]  Every Sunday, I'm here from 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:00:50.002 --> 00:00:53.443]  Central Standard Time as we syndicate out across the land.
[00:00:56.058 --> 00:01:06.956]  We'll be covering a lot of important news around the world and here in the United States, as well as our home here in Central Texas, where this broadcast originates from, the geographical heart of Texas.
[00:01:07.888 --> 00:01:09.929]  Big developments this week in 9-11 truth.
[00:01:09.949 --> 00:01:21.231]  For those that don't know what that is, that's the majority of the American people now not believing the official 9-11 story, and a majority of that majority believing it's a total inside job carried out by criminal elements of our own government.
[00:01:21.471 --> 00:01:24.732]  The award-winning director and producer David Lynch.
[00:01:25.212 --> 00:01:28.593]  Hundreds of major TV shows, Twin Peaks, films like The Elephant Man.
[00:01:29.233 --> 00:01:30.134]  It just goes on and on.
[00:01:56.112 --> 00:01:58.794]  On Friday, we'll be breaking that down.
[00:01:59.194 --> 00:02:01.235]  A really scary story out of the New York Post.
[00:02:01.295 --> 00:02:09.860]  Top-level insiders are dumping their stock at a record level, the highest level we've seen in the last 20-plus years.
[00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:16.564]  We'll be breaking down what that has meant to the economy and the stock market in the past when we see this type of mass selling.
[00:02:17.044 --> 00:02:20.646]  Also, the United Nations, this other London Telegraph, has downgraded...
[00:02:21.767 --> 00:02:22.768]  We're good to go.
[00:02:22.868 --> 00:02:23.949]  We're good to go.
[00:02:41.901 --> 00:02:46.826]  Climate change happening, but that is due to mainly the sun heating up.
[00:02:46.866 --> 00:02:51.209]  So we'll go over some of the science, and they're having to now admit to that and address that.
[00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:54.632]  Also, the FDA rejects new limits on mercury in vaccines.
[00:02:54.913 --> 00:02:59.597]  That's right, you were told in the last five years in a big national PR campaign that mercury's been removed.
[00:02:59.957 --> 00:03:03.040]  Contrary to being removed, it's been massively increased.
[00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:05.162]  So we'll get into that for you as well.
[00:03:05.182 --> 00:03:07.944]  I also want to tell you the news behind the news on the Iraq crisis.
[00:03:08.284 --> 00:03:09.425]  We'll be covering a little bit later.
[00:03:38.357 --> 00:03:41.358]  Now, I don't normally get butterflies when I'm on the air.
[00:03:42.078 --> 00:03:46.360]  I have been doing three hours a day, five days a week on the radio since 1998.
[00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:53.082]  And at many points in my radio career, I've been doing dual shows per day.
[00:03:53.142 --> 00:03:55.323]  Now I do a broadcast on Sundays.
[00:03:55.863 --> 00:03:59.064]  I have done over 4,000 radio interviews in the last six years.
[00:03:59.584 --> 00:04:03.245]  I'll be on Coast to Coast AM for three hours coming up Tuesday night.
[00:04:03.486 --> 00:04:05.526]  Just a plug there for George Norrie's great program.
[00:04:05.866 --> 00:04:07.607]  My point is I don't normally get butterflies.
[00:04:08.146 --> 00:04:08.986]  I've got butterflies.
[00:04:09.306 --> 00:04:09.827]  I'm nervous.
[00:04:11.247 --> 00:04:19.250]  I'm overwhelmed because I don't think I can do a good enough job telling you how powerful Apocalypto is.
[00:04:19.991 --> 00:04:22.152]  This is the best movie I have ever seen.
[00:04:22.172 --> 00:04:24.793]  I'm somewhat of a historical...
[00:04:27.341 --> 00:04:31.503]  I guess it's a hobby to study Mesoamerica because it's so interesting.
[00:04:31.843 --> 00:04:33.563]  I have been all over Mesoamerica.
[00:04:33.623 --> 00:04:38.985]  I have been to many of the big public sites and to many of the sites that haven't even really been dug up.
[00:04:39.385 --> 00:04:50.949]  I was just down there earlier this year on the Guatemalan border in Yucatan in some very primitive areas in Costa Maya that haven't even been excavated entirely.
[00:04:50.969 --> 00:04:54.130]  And so with that in mind...
[00:04:55.029 --> 00:05:01.992]  My mother also is a... I guess she's got a degree in history and she's been a big buff on Mesoamerica.
[00:05:02.792 --> 00:05:05.874]  And so I grew up being drug around in the jungles looking at these.
[00:05:06.354 --> 00:05:08.415]  But that's not why it's the best film I've ever seen.
[00:05:08.695 --> 00:05:11.256]  The history is so incredibly accurate.
[00:05:11.316 --> 00:05:14.217]  The cinematography is unspeakably good.
[00:05:14.237 --> 00:05:15.598]  A new standard.
[00:05:17.498 --> 00:05:20.960]  In fact, I hardly ever write notes for a radio show.
[00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:23.261]  I have three pages...
[00:05:24.195 --> 00:05:25.015]  And I see the phones are loading up.
[00:05:25.076 --> 00:05:26.556]  Folks, you're going to hear plugs to call in.
[00:05:26.576 --> 00:05:29.138]  We'll probably take calls by the end of the hour.
[00:05:29.158 --> 00:05:29.978]  I don't know, though.
[00:05:29.998 --> 00:05:32.960]  I mean, I've got to do some serious analysis and praise here for this film.
[00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:33.740]  And let me say this.
[00:05:53.564 --> 00:05:53.924]  We're good to go.
[00:06:13.732 --> 00:06:21.339]  Okay, I want it super good, and I know you guys can do it, because they're also going to, again, take notes off what I'm saying here and write some big reports here.
[00:06:21.939 --> 00:06:23.581]  Please don't add the groveling part here.
[00:06:23.601 --> 00:06:24.762]  I just want the listeners to know that.
[00:06:26.203 --> 00:06:30.107]  And the issue I'm about to talk about right now is that there are a few regrets I have in my life.
[00:06:30.667 --> 00:06:37.713]  One of them is I have not pursued any type of relationship with Mel Gibson, even though I've had a chance to, even though I know the family.
[00:06:37.753 --> 00:06:38.674]  I'm just going to leave it there.
[00:06:39.215 --> 00:06:46.281]  I mean, frankly, I've got a director friend here in town, great guy, love knowing him because he's a neat, smart person, but I'm not starstruck.
[00:06:46.341 --> 00:06:46.901]  Rick Linkletter.
[00:06:47.342 --> 00:06:48.342]  I know Keanu Reeves.
[00:06:48.383 --> 00:06:49.223]  I know Winona Ryder.
[00:06:49.263 --> 00:06:50.504]  I know Woody Harrelson.
[00:06:51.065 --> 00:06:52.206]  I'm good friends with Charlie Sheen.
[00:06:52.626 --> 00:06:56.169]  I love Charlie Sheen because his incredible courage to go public on 9-11 first
[00:06:57.270 --> 00:07:01.476]  It's now caused David Lynch to go public and others that I was just mentioning earlier.
[00:07:02.043 --> 00:07:02.363]  Okay.
[00:07:03.364 --> 00:07:04.684]  But again, I'm not starstruck.
[00:07:04.764 --> 00:07:11.788]  I mean, I'm into inventors and scientists and people who stand up against tyranny and lawyers who represent the downtrodden.
[00:07:12.068 --> 00:07:13.308]  I mean, those are my rock stars.
[00:07:13.548 --> 00:07:14.529]  But let me just tell you something.
[00:07:14.769 --> 00:07:16.550]  I am starstruck by Mel Gibson.
[00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:21.852]  I mean, I thought The Passion of the Christ was avant-garde and amazing, and I was a big fan of it.
[00:07:22.172 --> 00:07:23.133]  But let me just tell you something.
[00:07:23.353 --> 00:07:25.574]  I am like a schoolgirl here, folks.
[00:07:26.034 --> 00:07:27.115]  I mean, if I could...
[00:07:28.075 --> 00:07:35.824]  I mean, I'd be one of those people yelling and screaming at a line, you know, now to talk to Mel Gibson and just tell him how great this is so I'm going to write him a letter and I know how to get it right into his hands.
[00:07:36.665 --> 00:07:38.507]  You know, the family are fans of my work.
[00:07:38.567 --> 00:07:41.911]  I mean, you know Mel Gibson knew about the New World Order before I was born.
[00:07:41.951 --> 00:07:45.876]  He always talks about it and speaks about it and has made films that have that underlying message in it.
[00:07:46.176 --> 00:07:48.239]  But I am frustrated that when he came to town...
[00:07:48.968 --> 00:07:49.549]  We're good to go.
[00:07:49.569 --> 00:07:50.069]  We're good to go.
[00:08:14.102 --> 00:08:23.026]  I had a chance Friday night in the very same theater where he first screened it, first place he came to screen it, to a big public crowd, and I got a chance to sit there and watch it.
[00:08:23.366 --> 00:08:27.208]  It totally blew me away.
[00:08:27.248 --> 00:08:29.369]  It's going to go over a lot of people's heads.
[00:08:29.529 --> 00:08:34.331]  It's got the violence for a certain level of folks, but that's just making it accurate.
[00:08:35.436 --> 00:08:38.037]  And I just have to tell you, you've got to go see this movie.
[00:08:38.097 --> 00:08:42.018]  But perhaps after you've heard me talk about it, then you'll understand why it's such a powerful film.
[00:08:42.038 --> 00:08:45.320]  And I'm sure you'll find it entertaining, riveting, terrifying, frightening.
[00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:57.544]  But if you have a background in Mesoamerica, if you've researched it, and then if you understand human societies, well, if you've ever heard the show, you know I talk about the Aztecs, the overall Mayan culture, the Toltecs.
[00:08:57.844 --> 00:09:02.486]  You know I've discussed that here on air quite a bit and paralleled it with our society today.
[00:09:02.746 --> 00:09:05.087]  So this is near and dear to my heart, and it's Mel Gibson.
[00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:11.964]  And all I can say is, I mean, I was a fan before, but now I am just gaga over Mel Gibson.
[00:09:12.144 --> 00:09:13.065]  In fact, here are my notes.
[00:09:13.225 --> 00:09:16.547]  Let me just read through this first page, then we'll come back and I'll go over them.
[00:09:18.529 --> 00:09:20.870]  We now have the Mel Gibson standard.
[00:09:21.070 --> 00:09:23.352]  Okay, he is Stanley Kubrick on steroids.
[00:09:23.372 --> 00:09:24.653]  I'm also a big fan of Stanley Kubrick.
[00:09:25.073 --> 00:09:26.474]  Stanley Kubrick on steroids.
[00:09:26.714 --> 00:09:28.695]  He is the greatest living director.
[00:09:29.936 --> 00:09:32.278]  This film is off the chart powerful.
[00:09:32.538 --> 00:09:35.360]  Total immersion in the atmosphere.
[00:09:35.999 --> 00:09:36.680]  You are there.
[00:09:37.060 --> 00:09:38.101]  Suspended disbelief.
[00:09:38.881 --> 00:09:42.284]  The standard of casting, cinematography, the research.
[00:09:42.944 --> 00:09:48.869]  When we get back, I'll break down some of the film without giving away too much, and then tie it into modern day.
[00:09:49.629 --> 00:09:51.451]  Infowars.com!
[00:09:56.535 --> 00:10:00.057]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[00:10:00.398 --> 00:10:00.878]  My new film.
[00:10:03.849 --> 00:10:07.032]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[00:10:07.372 --> 00:10:09.333]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[00:10:09.694 --> 00:10:17.360]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:10:18.020 --> 00:10:25.086]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:10:25.486 --> 00:10:28.409]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran.
[00:10:28.809 --> 00:10:31.131]  A White House program to disseminate fake news.
[00:10:31.551 --> 00:10:32.432]  NSA spies.
[00:10:32.936 --> 00:10:34.237]  Or by calling toll-free 1-888-253-3139.

[00:11:02.621 --> 00:11:07.323]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson, here for the 2007 Red Book.
[00:11:07.343 --> 00:11:12.166]  The commodity markets like gold, silver, copper, aluminum, and oil have exploded over the last year.
[00:11:12.366 --> 00:11:15.087]  This is a glaring testimony of how quickly the U.S.
[00:11:15.147 --> 00:11:16.268]  dollar can be devalued.
[00:11:17.609 --> 00:11:22.211]  Many have turned to precious metals to provide a safe haven while increasing the potential profits.
[00:11:23.131 --> 00:11:30.335]  Though accumulating precious metals has been a proven method for the storage of wealth, it is important that you understand the market you are getting into.
[00:11:31.377 --> 00:11:34.458]  Midas Resources is offering the Red Book and Silver Dollar for only $27.95.
[00:11:36.599 --> 00:11:40.060]  The Red Book is the number one best-selling guide to gold and silver coins.
[00:11:41.020 --> 00:11:42.301]  Call for your copy today.
[00:11:42.541 --> 00:11:44.762]  It's 800-686-2237.
[00:11:45.822 --> 00:11:51.684]  If you've already accumulated or are planning to get into the precious metals market, you simply must have the Red Book in your library.
[00:11:52.364 --> 00:11:52.764]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:11:52.784 --> 00:11:53.004]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:12:01.483 --> 00:12:03.144]  Shelly, you look exhausted.
[00:12:03.204 --> 00:12:04.025]  What's wrong?
[00:12:04.305 --> 00:12:05.306]  I am so tired.
[00:12:05.366 --> 00:12:07.847]  I just get so hot at night and can't sleep.
[00:12:07.967 --> 00:12:09.068]  I have tried everything.
[00:12:09.128 --> 00:12:10.869]  All kinds of fans, sheets, pillows.
[00:12:11.029 --> 00:12:12.170]  You name it, I've tried it.
[00:12:12.310 --> 00:12:14.612]  My husband has always been a hot sleeper.
[00:12:14.772 --> 00:12:16.333]  He's never had a good night's sleep.
[00:12:16.553 --> 00:12:18.615]  Then we discovered something that really helped.
[00:12:18.715 --> 00:12:20.936]  It's called the BedFan Personal Cooling System.
[00:12:21.136 --> 00:12:21.637]  The what?
[00:12:21.917 --> 00:12:23.978]  The BedFan Personal Cooling System.
[00:12:24.118 --> 00:12:29.402]  It will keep you cool all night long and will work for everyone that sleeps hot, no matter what the reason.
[00:12:31.763 --> 00:12:32.883]  How well are you sleeping?
[00:12:33.103 --> 00:12:34.744]  Are you getting the rest your body needs?
[00:12:35.124 --> 00:12:39.465]  Sleep disorder centers across the country recommend that you must stay cool to get a good night's sleep.
[00:12:39.705 --> 00:12:43.006]  The Bed Fan will keep you cool and give you the restful sleep you deserve.

[00:12:47.847 --> 00:12:49.067]  Is your partner a hot sleeper?
[00:12:49.087 --> 00:12:52.308]  Or are you looking for the perfect gift for that person who has everything?
[00:12:52.568 --> 00:12:53.868]  The Bed Fan is the answer.
[00:12:54.068 --> 00:12:54.888]  Visit BedFan.com.
[00:12:54.908 --> 00:12:56.788]  That's BedFan.com.
[00:13:00.365 --> 00:13:00.945]  Hello, friends.
[00:13:01.025 --> 00:13:02.707]  Alex Jones here with an important question.
[00:13:02.947 --> 00:13:04.988]  When was the last time you used pure soap?

[00:14:14.782 --> 00:14:17.426]  Now live in Austin, Texas.
[00:14:17.686 --> 00:14:18.808]  Here's Alex Jones.
[00:14:26.969 --> 00:14:31.151]  Yeah, Woody in Round Rock, Mandy in Connecticut, Jeff's in Pennsylvania.
[00:14:31.171 --> 00:14:33.712]  He says he disagrees with me about child kidnapping services.
[00:14:33.772 --> 00:14:35.032]  I mean, child protective services.
[00:14:35.413 --> 00:14:37.153]  We'll go to you first, Jeff, when I go to calls.
[00:14:37.193 --> 00:14:46.197]  But I need to get into Apocalypto, and then we'll take calls, and I'll get back into all the other world and national news here for folks listening across the country and worldwide on the Internet.
[00:14:47.252 --> 00:14:49.113]  Boy, I tell you, there is so much to cover here.
[00:14:49.593 --> 00:14:56.976]  Basically, I mean, every angle of this film, the casting uses, you know, real indigenous populations, 90 plus percent.
[00:14:57.736 --> 00:15:02.418]  The cinematography shot in this new super digital format has a look I've never seen.
[00:15:03.519 --> 00:15:07.040]  The handheld look of some of it is the best I've ever seen it pulled off.
[00:15:07.340 --> 00:15:10.821]  I mean, this is avant-garde, or meaning totally new, state-of-the-art cinematography.
[00:15:12.831 --> 00:15:15.053]  At every step of the film.
[00:15:15.113 --> 00:15:24.081]  So I mean it when I say that Mel Gibson is a greater director than Stanley Kubrick.
[00:15:24.441 --> 00:15:37.033]  There is no debating it in my mind, and I think that I had thought previously that that was Stanley Kubrick, and it was Stanley Kubrick, because Mel Gibson hadn't made this film yet.
[00:15:37.453 --> 00:15:39.255]  I mean, Braveheart's excellent, so is...
[00:15:40.906 --> 00:15:42.327]  The Passion of the Christ.
[00:15:42.687 --> 00:15:46.049]  I mean, they're A-plus films, but they weren't at Kubrick level.
[00:15:46.489 --> 00:15:49.230]  This is off the charts.
[00:15:49.911 --> 00:15:50.571]  Off the charts.
[00:15:52.210 --> 00:15:54.632]  Number one, Gibson knows what we all really want, and we want the truth.
[00:16:19.361 --> 00:16:29.064]  And that's why the Patriot is the state, an out-of-control tyranny against the family, against ragtag forces, and it's historical.
[00:16:29.084 --> 00:16:35.466]  It's the same thing with William Wallace and his battle against the British in Braveheart.
[00:16:36.227 --> 00:16:39.531]  And it's what we witness in Apocalypto is the truth.
[00:16:39.951 --> 00:16:43.675]  The government isn't some good, loving, sweet thing that's going to take care of you.
[00:16:43.715 --> 00:16:50.702]  In almost every case in history, it is oppressive, it is brutal, it is murdering, and all you can count on is your family.
[00:16:50.962 --> 00:16:52.344]  Your family comes first.
[00:16:52.424 --> 00:16:53.225]  Your tribe.
[00:16:53.805 --> 00:16:54.046]  Your...
[00:16:55.055 --> 00:16:58.276]  Extended family, and Gibson focuses in on that.
[00:16:58.316 --> 00:17:00.956]  He shows the joys of fatherhood.
[00:17:01.236 --> 00:17:06.677]  I mean, this captures the ancient hunting ritual like no other film I've ever seen.
[00:17:06.697 --> 00:17:10.878]  For people that don't understand hunting, it isn't the killing of the animals.
[00:17:11.278 --> 00:17:13.398]  It is the tribal nature of it.
[00:17:13.478 --> 00:17:16.319]  It is what mankind is designed to do.
[00:17:16.699 --> 00:17:20.020]  Men getting together and going out and hunting.
[00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:21.480]  And so, again, that's a...
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:34.328]  Just a tiny part of the film, and then the scene with the tribal elders around the fire early on in the film, I've seen them try to capture this in 50 other movies, and they've never captured something like this.
[00:17:34.388 --> 00:17:37.971]  I mean, you feel the ancestral memories of all human beings.
[00:17:38.011 --> 00:17:43.935]  You'll come from this, and whether you're Germanic or Asiatic or African, it doesn't matter.
[00:17:44.015 --> 00:17:45.896]  It stirs instinctive memories.
[00:17:46.957 --> 00:17:47.317]  Memories.
[00:17:47.677 --> 00:17:50.038]  I'm not talking... I don't believe in reincarnation, folks.
[00:17:50.078 --> 00:17:55.501]  I mean, instinctive family memories, tribal memories, genetic race memories.
[00:17:55.781 --> 00:17:58.342]  This whole film stirs race memories.
[00:17:58.582 --> 00:18:02.785]  Because they were doing human sacrifice in Gaul, and in what is Germany today.
[00:18:03.265 --> 00:18:05.546]  And they were doing human sacrifice in ancient Greece.
[00:18:06.126 --> 00:18:08.608]  And there was human sacrifice in Asia.
[00:18:08.828 --> 00:18:10.028]  What is China today?
[00:18:10.048 --> 00:18:13.070]  I mean, the things you see in this film, the same...
[00:18:13.370 --> 00:18:17.453]  This thing has happened over and over again, and I'm going to explain when we get back from break why.
[00:18:19.095 --> 00:18:31.725]  And it details the horrors of unrestrained government and how sickos always get into control, and they always want to press on the nerve of power and abuse and dominate and terrorize populations.
[00:18:31.785 --> 00:18:37.770]  And so this is why this type of behavior is the norm, not the exception, in human society.
[00:18:38.530 --> 00:18:55.474]  Just the control freak exercise of power, the cult of power, and then the spectacles, how the people of the city feed on the people from the country, and the Britney Spears of their day, all in their garb and all so arrogant and haughty.
[00:18:56.266 --> 00:18:56.927]  We're good to go.
[00:19:16.909 --> 00:19:25.643]  And it shows, just like the Roman Colosseum, which was a form of human sacrifice, more stylized, ritualized hunting that the population would view.
[00:19:26.084 --> 00:19:29.108]  So the Romans, again, that was human sacrifice, just done in a different way.
[00:19:29.389 --> 00:19:32.033]  Delivered, executed in a different format.
[00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:38.892]  You see the exact same Roman Colosseum-type human sacrifice.
[00:19:38.952 --> 00:19:41.272]  And, you know, Gibson isn't hardcore enough.
[00:19:41.312 --> 00:19:45.194]  He gets criticized by liberal anthropologists saying, well, it's just their culture.
[00:19:45.214 --> 00:19:46.294]  You can't say it's bad.
[00:19:46.534 --> 00:19:50.615]  You can't make a decision and say a culture's bad when the Nazi culture isn't bad.
[00:19:50.775 --> 00:19:51.696]  I happen to think it is.
[00:19:52.116 --> 00:19:55.657]  You know, a mass culture of death and destruction and murder and killing innocent people.
[00:19:55.897 --> 00:19:57.317]  No, that's a culture gone bad.
[00:19:57.617 --> 00:20:02.559]  It's the same thing with the Aztecs that dominated and brought down, basically, those cultures.
[00:20:03.940 --> 00:20:04.641]  Unbelievable.
[00:20:05.542 --> 00:20:21.541]  So he did hold back in that they show a big pile of dead bodies of people they've sacrificed, and according to the guides and the books I've read and what's carved on the walls down there, that most of the people they would sacrifice were cut up and eaten in...
[00:20:24.230 --> 00:20:25.631]  A ritualized activity.
[00:20:25.671 --> 00:20:27.852]  The heart was burned in ashes.
[00:20:28.052 --> 00:20:33.254]  So he held back with the crowds at the feet of the pyramids when they kicked the decapitated corpse down them.
[00:20:33.754 --> 00:20:53.443]  He held back because the crowds don't eat their flesh, which according to most of the anthropologists and archaeologists and folks that have gone over the different primitive languages, it's actually complex, but by primitive I mean ancient languages, that that is what they did.
[00:20:54.051 --> 00:20:56.857]  Just unbelievably accurate.
[00:20:57.177 --> 00:20:57.799]  And you know, this UT...
[00:21:00.638 --> 00:21:13.289]  You know, half-baked professor, assistant professor, this art professor who's in the States been criticizing it, says, well, when they're walking through a tunnel by one of the pyramids, it shows a head being severed and blood spurting out carved on the wall.
[00:21:14.270 --> 00:21:15.891]  Well, that was from an earlier period.
[00:21:16.151 --> 00:21:23.257]  Just mindless nitpicking here, but doesn't deny that it was mass sacrifice, just shows their moral relativism.
[00:21:23.317 --> 00:21:27.681]  For many years, I'll get on the radio and use the example of a culture gone bad,
[00:21:28.101 --> 00:21:28.581]  We're good to go.
[00:21:28.601 --> 00:21:29.022]  We're good to go.
[00:21:51.317 --> 00:21:54.539]  People would email me or call and say, how dare you talk bad about their culture?
[00:21:54.579 --> 00:21:55.399]  You're just a racist!
[00:21:55.800 --> 00:21:58.921]  And I go, oh, well, I criticize the Druid-sacrificing people.
[00:21:59.502 --> 00:22:00.802]  Oh, I criticize the Romans.
[00:22:00.842 --> 00:22:02.123]  I guess I'm against white people.
[00:22:02.483 --> 00:22:04.224]  No, I'm saying this is an evil culture.
[00:22:04.384 --> 00:22:05.785]  Well, you can't judge a culture!
[00:22:06.466 --> 00:22:08.006]  Okay, so Pol Pot wasn't bad.
[00:22:08.267 --> 00:22:09.167]  Stalin wasn't bad.
[00:22:09.427 --> 00:22:10.268]  Hitler wasn't bad.
[00:22:10.308 --> 00:22:11.208]  The Romans weren't bad.
[00:22:11.288 --> 00:22:12.589]  Feeding children to the lions.
[00:22:13.189 --> 00:22:15.090]  That's okay, because it's just a culture.
[00:22:15.190 --> 00:22:15.411]  No!
[00:22:16.391 --> 00:22:17.852]  We need to make a moral difference.
[00:22:19.381 --> 00:22:20.542]  We need to discern.
[00:22:20.782 --> 00:22:22.743]  We need to say what's wrong and what's evil.
[00:22:24.164 --> 00:22:27.967]  And so we'll go over what this professor said later, and I'll finish up going through this film.
[00:22:30.069 --> 00:22:35.814]  But if they take your capacity to recognize evil away, then the evil can take over.
[00:22:36.314 --> 00:22:38.516]  Evil always seeks to remove the definition of evil.
[00:22:39.196 --> 00:22:42.359]  Evil always wants to take standards away, so it can control you.
[00:22:42.979 --> 00:22:45.101]  We'll be right back after this news break.
[00:22:46.022 --> 00:22:47.263]  We'll get into your calls, too, as well.
[00:22:53.254 --> 00:22:53.614]  Come on.
[00:22:53.694 --> 00:22:57.737]  People who use Cardivite know about the pollutants in our body and want the milk.
[00:22:57.937 --> 00:23:00.458]  For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself.

[00:25:11.307 --> 00:25:15.250]  I'm John Commuta, creator of the Transforming Debt into Wealth program.
[00:25:15.490 --> 00:25:19.434]  I did it, and so have nearly a half million others using my proven system.
[00:25:19.574 --> 00:25:21.916]  I'm completely debt-free now, thanks to John Commuta.
[00:25:22.116 --> 00:25:26.899]  I will be able to pay off my house in approximately two and a half years on a 30-year mortgage.
[00:25:27.399 --> 00:25:29.520]  It works no matter how much debt you have.

[00:26:00.387 --> 00:26:04.349]  I found this company online, and they have this really unique variety of salt wellness products.
[00:26:04.569 --> 00:26:08.111]  I read some of the articles and ended up ordering this beautiful salt lamp.
[00:26:08.391 --> 00:26:12.472]  According to the company, they said that the salt crystal lamps gently purify indoor air.
[00:26:12.753 --> 00:26:13.693]  I was so amazed.
[00:26:13.933 --> 00:26:16.794]  I put it in the baby's room, and it made a perfect nightlight.
[00:26:16.975 --> 00:26:18.855]  Both my husband and I could tell the difference.
[00:26:19.236 --> 00:26:24.438]  SolelyWellness.com is a unique company that offers salt wellness products from around the world.
[00:26:24.898 --> 00:26:30.821]  So, I went back to the site and ordered their Soleil Simple Natural Cleaning Products, also made with Himalayan salt.
[00:26:31.081 --> 00:26:32.802]  I figured it would clean really well.
[00:26:33.062 --> 00:26:36.244]  The natural cleaning products worked wonderfully and there was no scent.
[00:26:36.424 --> 00:26:40.286]  This company has so many products my whole family can enjoy and feel better with.
[00:26:40.586 --> 00:26:42.087]  Plus, the service was great.

[00:27:20.485 --> 00:27:26.930]  We'll be taking calls at the end of this hour and into the next hour, but right now I'm continuing with my treatise on Apocalypto.
[00:27:26.950 --> 00:27:29.612]  Cutting through the lies and disinformation.
[00:27:41.798 --> 00:27:42.958]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:27:45.059 --> 00:27:48.741]  Welcome back, my friends.
[00:27:48.861 --> 00:27:53.683]  In the history of the world, every empire, every civilization has fallen.
[00:27:53.743 --> 00:27:57.164]  Elites take over the society.
[00:27:57.204 --> 00:27:57.624]  They loot it.
[00:27:57.644 --> 00:28:03.966]  There's almost four trillion dollars, according to the Associated Press, existing from the Pentagon.
[00:28:04.427 --> 00:28:05.727]  The Treasury has been totally looted.
[00:28:05.747 --> 00:28:07.568]  There's no-bid contracts everywhere.
[00:28:09.972 --> 00:28:10.353]  It's simple.
[00:28:10.373 --> 00:28:22.407]  The military-industrial complex owned by the large private central banks made a conscious decision to stop just overthrowing Iran or Guatemala.
[00:28:23.491 --> 00:28:24.632]  Or other third world countries.
[00:28:24.652 --> 00:28:26.373]  They said, hey, let's just overthrow the U.S.
[00:28:26.393 --> 00:28:28.015]  That's what Eisenhower warned you about.
[00:28:28.415 --> 00:28:29.516]  They overthrew the country.
[00:28:30.476 --> 00:28:35.480]  They used propaganda to convince even those that work in the news media that, oh, it's not that bad.
[00:28:35.861 --> 00:28:38.763]  They repackaged all the tyranny and sell it to the population.
[00:28:39.403 --> 00:28:45.348]  And we sit here living in a soft tyranny, a dictatorship of the oligarchs.
[00:28:46.168 --> 00:28:55.010]  And now, because they've gotten so greedy, they're going to completely destroy the middle class, completely destroy the dollar, and completely destroy the country.
[00:28:55.050 --> 00:28:58.591]  We have now, for a full year, been inside the North American Union.
[00:28:59.051 --> 00:29:08.633]  The Council on Foreign Relations and the Security and Prosperity Partnership governmental body have released a report just a few weeks ago that CNN even covered, saying it's on track.
[00:29:08.953 --> 00:29:12.374]  The country has now been successfully brought into the American Union.
[00:29:13.787 --> 00:29:23.575]  And our military now, ground forces in Iraq, are 20%, according to an Army report, foreign, and most of them are Mexican, from Mexico.
[00:29:23.635 --> 00:29:24.316]  They're not U.S.
[00:29:24.356 --> 00:29:24.816]  citizens.
[00:29:25.337 --> 00:29:37.527]  And they are now saying that the majority of the force in the next three years will be, the majority of the ground force, infantry force, will be Latin American.
[00:29:38.307 --> 00:29:40.289]  There's also a lot of other foreigners mixed into that.
[00:29:40.934 --> 00:29:43.516]  And if you think that's pro-America, I'm sure it is.
[00:29:43.636 --> 00:29:43.856]  I know.
[00:29:44.076 --> 00:29:45.117]  Whatever they tell you.
[00:29:45.137 --> 00:29:47.498]  Troops breathing depleted uranium is pro-America.
[00:29:48.339 --> 00:29:51.641]  Total destruction of the Bill of Rights is pro-America.
[00:29:51.741 --> 00:30:03.729]  I got one piece of solace for all you scum out there that love world government and love open borders and think you're a bunch of conservatives and you tune into all the baloney and you buy into it.
[00:30:04.370 --> 00:30:10.634]  The people you love, the people you bootlick, have destroyed your dollar and they've destroyed your future.
[00:30:11.354 --> 00:30:13.256]  And I just want you to know they did it to you.
[00:30:13.456 --> 00:30:15.437]  You may smile at them while they rape you.
[00:30:16.317 --> 00:30:16.718]  Okay?
[00:30:17.118 --> 00:30:23.742]  And you may enjoy killing this country, but at least I have the solace knowing that you're going to get hurt in all this too.
[00:30:24.483 --> 00:30:25.623]  And I know you're weak-minded.
[00:30:25.884 --> 00:30:32.548]  Slaves, most slaves in history actually like their abusers, they make excuses for their abusers, and they go along with it.
[00:30:33.348 --> 00:30:37.291]  And so I would have to say 2006 is the death of this country.
[00:30:38.031 --> 00:30:38.972]  On this final show...
[00:30:40.618 --> 00:30:45.820]  Of the year, December 31st, 2001, I can tell you this has been the worst year in the 233 years of U.S.
[00:30:45.860 --> 00:30:46.400]  history since 1776.
[00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:47.900]  This has been the worst year in our history.
[00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:49.921]  I mean, when I say they abolished the Bill of Rights with H.R. 6166,
[00:31:08.487 --> 00:31:09.208]  Go read the bill.
[00:31:09.268 --> 00:31:10.109]  Go read the analysis.
[00:31:10.129 --> 00:31:11.470]  Listen to what Ron Paul said reading it.
[00:31:11.490 --> 00:31:14.313]  I mean, go check it out.
[00:31:14.333 --> 00:31:17.976]  You don't know that America is the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[00:31:18.036 --> 00:31:21.740]  You think it's plastic flags made in China by a slave.
[00:31:22.725 --> 00:31:24.266]  You think America is checkpoints?
[00:31:24.707 --> 00:31:29.911]  You think America is breathalyzers for your kids in the public schools and fences and shakedowns?
[00:31:30.271 --> 00:31:33.293]  You think America is topless bars and open borders?
[00:31:33.853 --> 00:31:36.295]  You think America is cheeseburgers and heart disease?
[00:31:36.856 --> 00:31:40.859]  You think America... That's what you think America is, okay?
[00:31:41.039 --> 00:31:41.479]  It isn't.
[00:31:41.719 --> 00:31:42.940]  That isn't what the U.S.
[00:31:42.980 --> 00:31:43.481]  was.
[00:31:43.841 --> 00:31:45.622]  It was land of the free, home of the brave.
[00:31:45.863 --> 00:31:50.226]  Not land of the obese, surveilled, dumbed-down slaves, okay?
[00:31:51.397 --> 00:31:54.159]  And I'm mad about this country dying right in front of our eyes.
[00:31:55.080 --> 00:31:55.841]  I'm upset about it.
[00:31:55.861 --> 00:31:58.863]  I'm upset about my children, frankly, not having much of a future.
[00:31:58.883 --> 00:32:06.149]  I'm upset about the fact that the military has been training to take our guns and take our private property.
[00:32:06.929 --> 00:32:07.830]  I said I'd take calls.
[00:32:10.432 --> 00:32:16.697]  I just don't know how you can read the Associated Press and the Boston Globe telling you about how our troops are foreigners.
[00:32:18.618 --> 00:32:25.323]  And I don't know how you can listen to generals shoot their mouths off about how after the next attack we're going to have martial law and how good it is.
[00:32:25.423 --> 00:32:29.687]  And I don't know how you can sit to me, what do you think tyranny is all about?
[00:32:29.907 --> 00:32:37.453]  Tyranny needs to be put in place so they can take your pension funds and if you complain about it, you're going to go off to a forced labor camp if you're lucky.
[00:32:38.674 --> 00:32:42.557]  Tyranny is about being able to do whatever they want against you.
[00:32:43.197 --> 00:32:47.581]  It's about powerful people running your life and exercising power.
[00:32:48.357 --> 00:32:49.278]  That's what it's about.
[00:32:49.938 --> 00:32:51.839]  It's about the New World Order.
[00:32:53.280 --> 00:32:59.203]  And you may think a radiated food filled with toxic substances is the American dream.
[00:32:59.403 --> 00:32:59.763]  It isn't.
[00:33:01.204 --> 00:33:01.604]  Okay?
[00:33:01.865 --> 00:33:05.246]  And you may think, I just don't even know what to say anymore.
[00:33:05.286 --> 00:33:06.627]  I don't even know what to do anymore.
[00:33:06.647 --> 00:33:10.809]  You know, I'm here on New Year's Eve.
[00:33:11.110 --> 00:33:12.791]  I'm not going to be out getting drunk.
[00:33:13.491 --> 00:33:15.292]  I'm not going to be out stuffing my belly.
[00:33:16.269 --> 00:33:17.790]  You know what I'm going to be doing after I leave here tonight?
[00:33:18.171 --> 00:33:21.853]  I'm going down to my studio to work on a film I'm making about world government.
[00:33:22.574 --> 00:33:23.655]  And you know why I do that?
[00:33:23.915 --> 00:33:28.279]  I do that because I desperately want to see these criminals pay.
[00:33:29.940 --> 00:33:35.784]  And I desperately want you to wake up and understand that private banks own both parties.
[00:33:36.245 --> 00:33:38.727]  And that they sit up there and they snicker and they laugh at you.
[00:33:40.063 --> 00:33:47.926]  And because I want you to know the truth, and I want you to know as things get worse and worse in this country, I want you to know who did it to you!
[00:33:47.946 --> 00:33:53.247]  Because that's the sickest thing all.
[00:33:54.328 --> 00:33:55.608]  I got a lot of globalists.
[00:33:56.248 --> 00:34:00.650]  Carry out 9-11 and then stand up there on TV and take credit as saviors.
[00:34:01.590 --> 00:34:06.612]  Stand up there on television on top of rubble piles and be praised as heroes.
[00:34:06.672 --> 00:34:07.712]  It makes me want to puke.
[00:34:12.483 --> 00:34:13.543]  You know, there's nowhere to go.
[00:34:17.225 --> 00:34:18.345]  There's nowhere to run.
[00:34:19.366 --> 00:34:20.706]  You know, just don't listen to me.
[00:34:20.786 --> 00:34:22.927]  Fine, fine, do what you do.
[00:34:23.007 --> 00:34:24.688]  Deny, make excuses.
[00:34:24.788 --> 00:34:26.409]  Okay, foreign trips are good.
[00:34:28.547 --> 00:34:34.010]  I remember reading federal documents a decade ago when Bill Clinton announced they were going to have Homeland Security.
[00:34:34.590 --> 00:34:35.391]  Multiple speeches.
[00:34:36.071 --> 00:34:48.297]  And they laid out an ambitious plan of how they were going to have federal emergency management centers as emergency centers locally where the FBI, the CIA, and the military would command your local police and your local government.
[00:34:50.999 --> 00:34:53.280]  Guess what I have in front of me today from the Washington Post.
[00:34:54.992 --> 00:34:59.234]  Localities operate intelligence centers to pool terror data.
[00:34:59.574 --> 00:35:04.276]  Fusion facilities raise privacy worries as a wide range of information is collected.
[00:35:04.576 --> 00:35:14.960]  You know, when you read a mainstream news article, you can tell when it's just some dumbbell reporter who just buys into the general propaganda and regurgitates it, and you can tell when you're dealing with a real snake.
[00:35:15.100 --> 00:35:17.961]  And let me tell you, the Washington Post and New York Times are full of them.
[00:35:18.482 --> 00:35:19.462]  Liberal media.
[00:35:19.902 --> 00:35:23.924]  They just play that good cop, bad cop game with you all day, and it sure fools you, doesn't it?
[00:35:24.504 --> 00:35:25.305]  Federally built, federally run.
[00:35:52.620 --> 00:36:05.605]  And they know people are worried about federal control, and so they come out and talk about these sinners, and then say they're locally controlled, and then spit it that there's a problem, and say that we need to have federal control over them.
[00:36:05.625 --> 00:36:06.486]  Man, that's slick.
[00:36:08.827 --> 00:36:09.907]  That's more than slick.
[00:36:11.268 --> 00:36:14.869]  Localities operate intelligence centers to pool terror data.
[00:36:15.831 --> 00:36:16.151]  I know.
[00:36:16.311 --> 00:36:18.373]  Was that complex for you out there listening?
[00:36:18.813 --> 00:36:19.113]  I know.
[00:36:19.153 --> 00:36:28.499]  It wasn't somebody just saying liberal, liberal, liberal over and over again when their books are published by the Council on Fine Relations and their New World Order liberals scamming you.
[00:36:28.679 --> 00:36:30.200]  See, don't you understand that?
[00:36:30.420 --> 00:36:31.861]  You haven't figured that out yet.
[00:36:32.181 --> 00:36:33.181]  This is complex.
[00:36:33.281 --> 00:36:34.482]  Freedom is complex.
[00:36:35.763 --> 00:36:36.863]  I said I'd go to your calls.
[00:36:36.903 --> 00:36:40.946]  These are federal control arms.
[00:36:42.852 --> 00:36:46.875]  Where they track every one of you by your cell phone in the real time.
[00:36:46.895 --> 00:36:50.678]  They can type in a code and listen like that to everything you're saying.
[00:36:50.738 --> 00:36:54.141]  We'll be right back with a little trickier call.
[00:36:54.161 --> 00:36:55.061]  Stay with me!

[00:37:55.003 --> 00:37:59.447]  HerbalHealer.com Celebrating 18 years of dedication.
[00:38:00.299 --> 00:38:00.879]  It's a fact.
[00:38:01.079 --> 00:38:05.520]  You can legally eliminate credit card debt, which has been fraudulently created by the banks.
[00:38:05.960 --> 00:38:11.141]  Since its creation in 1913, the Federal Reserve has not been held responsible for its own debt.
[00:38:11.441 --> 00:38:14.641]  So why should you, the hardworking American, be harassed for yours?
[00:38:14.901 --> 00:38:22.043]  There's a double standard when it comes to being responsible for debt, and unlike the Federal Reserve, the people of this country can't print more money when needed.
[00:38:22.363 --> 00:38:29.544]  Day of Jubilee has created a successful program designed for people that want to stop harassing calls and threatening letters from bill collectors.
[00:38:29.984 --> 00:38:31.845]  We also do credit restoration.
[00:38:32.286 --> 00:38:40.751]  Join the thousands of Americans who now breathe a sigh of relief because they have legally eliminated their credit card debt instead of living each day in fear.
[00:38:41.072 --> 00:38:42.653]  It's time to turn your life around.
[00:38:42.973 --> 00:38:44.454]  Call Day of Jubilee.
[00:38:44.634 --> 00:38:45.534]  Open 9 a.m.
[00:38:45.595 --> 00:38:46.415]  to 5 p.m.
[00:38:46.475 --> 00:38:47.976]  Central Standard Time at 920-293-8024.
[00:38:48.016 --> 00:38:48.396]  That's 920-293-8024.
[00:38:48.496 --> 00:38:49.457]  And ask for Robert.
[00:38:49.517 --> 00:38:52.479]  Don't wait any longer to get your life back in order.
[00:39:00.980 --> 00:39:03.242]  Attention, attention everyone!
[00:39:03.262 --> 00:39:05.683]  A brand new invention just released.
[00:39:05.743 --> 00:39:10.266]  It's called Wrist Ease, the new patented portable ergonomic wrist support.
[00:39:10.866 --> 00:39:17.330]  Wrist Ease comforts your wrists from the sometimes painful tasks of typing, writing, using a mouse, or adding machine.

[00:41:01.232 --> 00:41:03.734]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
[00:41:03.814 --> 00:41:05.114]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:41:25.808 --> 00:41:26.368]  That's right.
[00:41:26.408 --> 00:41:28.429]  The New World Order didn't take over the U.S.
[00:41:28.469 --> 00:41:34.912]  with an invading army like Hitler going into France or Czechoslovakia or Poland.
[00:41:35.753 --> 00:41:45.557]  They just came in with lobbying money, bought off our politicians, set up federal standardized police training, took over our police, took over our military.
[00:41:45.577 --> 00:41:47.018]  Now they're making our military foreign.
[00:41:47.798 --> 00:41:49.379]  And they're openly talking about martial law.
[00:41:49.399 --> 00:41:51.700]  They've openly abolished the Bill of Rights.
[00:41:51.720 --> 00:41:53.301]  2006 was a hellish year for this country.
[00:41:54.091 --> 00:41:56.073]  Now, again, the country is gone.
[00:41:56.113 --> 00:42:01.577]  We've been in the North American Union from January 1st of this year through now.
[00:42:01.617 --> 00:42:03.578]  They are merging all the federal agencies.
[00:42:03.939 --> 00:42:07.441]  They are having secret governmental meetings that's in the Canadian and Mexican papers.
[00:42:07.822 --> 00:42:08.082]  U.S.
[00:42:08.142 --> 00:42:10.984]  media knows to not say a word unless it's Lou Dobbs.
[00:42:11.284 --> 00:42:12.405]  They stay in line.
[00:42:12.445 --> 00:42:14.447]  They keep their stinking jobs.
[00:42:15.433 --> 00:42:16.796]  That's just how it works.
[00:42:17.217 --> 00:42:25.614]  Three months ago up in Canada, had the heads of all three state departments there, CEOs all there, they were signing agreements, doing the deals, merging it all.
[00:42:26.923 --> 00:42:32.226]  Business owners all over the country are getting their new North American Union ID number instead of their tax ID number.
[00:42:32.266 --> 00:42:33.467]  It's all happening.
[00:42:33.867 --> 00:42:36.388]  Business owners are calling left and right going, yeah, it says it now.
[00:42:37.429 --> 00:42:40.291]  But a good old boy, they'll just stick their belly out.
[00:42:40.371 --> 00:42:41.992]  They've even called me and emailed me.
[00:42:42.692 --> 00:42:44.473]  It's time for America to change.
[00:42:44.853 --> 00:42:47.475]  Old Bush is doing a good job.
[00:42:49.099 --> 00:42:50.440]  You see, because they're not conservatives.
[00:42:50.460 --> 00:42:51.301]  They're not Americans.
[00:42:51.321 --> 00:42:52.281]  They're cowards.
[00:42:53.142 --> 00:42:56.905]  What they do is go find the establishment and bow down and suck its boots.
[00:42:58.006 --> 00:42:59.647]  They're social climbers.
[00:42:59.687 --> 00:43:00.628]  They climb the ladder.
[00:43:00.668 --> 00:43:03.670]  That's all they've done in their lives is yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
[00:43:03.930 --> 00:43:10.936]  Whatever the establishment says is, whatever the most popular thing put out by the government is, whatever the line is, they're going to repeat it.
[00:43:11.356 --> 00:43:12.357]  In God, repeat it!
[00:43:13.550 --> 00:43:14.550]  Repeat it.
[00:43:14.570 --> 00:43:15.731]  Tell me the economy's great.
[00:43:15.951 --> 00:43:17.991]  Tell me you love the dollar being devalued.
[00:43:18.011 --> 00:43:21.312]  Tell me you love that because that was a policy of the government.
[00:43:21.893 --> 00:43:23.313]  Tell me you love the Iraq War.
[00:43:23.553 --> 00:43:25.894]  I mean, how dumb do they think the American people are?
[00:43:27.214 --> 00:43:29.775]  How stupid do they think the American people are?
[00:43:32.136 --> 00:43:33.936]  I'm asking you this question out there, listeners.
[00:43:35.557 --> 00:43:39.358]  How stupid do they think we are?
[00:43:41.659 --> 00:43:43.099]  Pretty darn stupid, obviously.
[00:43:43.743 --> 00:43:50.965]  The official plan was to never leave Iraq, to build permanent bases all over it, to break it in three parts, and I was telling you that a year before the war.
[00:43:51.505 --> 00:43:53.345]  People call me, go, you're so smart, how'd you know?
[00:43:53.545 --> 00:43:55.005]  Because they told us, that's what they do.
[00:43:55.246 --> 00:43:59.206]  They tell you in the actual policy reports, that's how dumb they think that we are.
[00:43:59.366 --> 00:44:10.869]  They admit within government what they're going to do, then they go out and have their public announcements, knowing the media will never even contradict them because it's owned by the very same defense contractors that are making money off the war.
[00:44:12.486 --> 00:44:26.669]  So even those of you out there that are into the war, because it's simulated manhood, like a football game for you, that's how you're tough, is you eat pizza and drink beer in front of the TV and watch bombs go off and precision-guided munitions, and you feel powerful.
[00:44:27.889 --> 00:44:28.870]  I mean, I understand.
[00:44:28.990 --> 00:44:30.050]  You can't find Iraq.
[00:44:30.070 --> 00:44:32.210]  You've got a low IQ.
[00:44:32.250 --> 00:44:32.870]  You're scum.
[00:44:33.751 --> 00:44:35.071]  You don't really care about the troops.
[00:44:35.231 --> 00:44:35.871]  I understand.
[00:44:36.951 --> 00:44:39.692]  But for you, that's patriotism.
[00:44:41.161 --> 00:44:44.583]  And so they lie to you and say we're going to be gone in six months.
[00:44:44.883 --> 00:44:45.683]  Mission accomplished.
[00:44:45.883 --> 00:44:47.084]  We're going to be gone in one year.
[00:44:47.164 --> 00:44:47.804]  We promise.
[00:44:47.824 --> 00:44:50.705]  And then they say we'll leave as soon as we can declare victory.
[00:44:51.006 --> 00:44:52.606]  Victory isn't meant to be declared.
[00:44:52.626 --> 00:44:53.787]  It's like the war on drugs.
[00:45:07.950 --> 00:45:09.051]  We're good to go.
[00:45:38.980 --> 00:45:55.472]  To the world I am unimportant Just because I have nothing to give So you call this your frequency Tell me why it costs so much to live
[00:45:58.604 --> 00:46:26.874]  Tell me who I am The world can turn me down But I won't turn away, yeah No, no And I won't turn around All my work and real adventures Never seem to get me very far
[00:46:34.626 --> 00:46:36.908]  We're good to go.
[00:46:44.858 --> 00:46:45.558]  I'm already here.
[00:46:45.578 --> 00:46:46.659]  Oh no, I'm already here.
[00:47:13.624 --> 00:47:14.024]  We're good to go.
[00:47:56.758 --> 00:47:57.258]  We're good to go.
[00:47:57.278 --> 00:47:58.599]  We're good to go.
[00:47:58.639 --> 00:47:59.439]  We're good to go.
[00:47:59.479 --> 00:48:00.060]  We're good to go.
[00:48:26.732 --> 00:48:28.713]  We're good to go.
[00:48:56.308 --> 00:48:56.829]  I think.
[00:49:18.145 --> 00:49:26.427]  Disagree with Congress.
[00:49:26.467 --> 00:49:27.907]  Again, they have a 60% approval rating.
[00:49:28.067 --> 00:49:30.348]  And there's a bunch of other polls out there that show similar numbers.
[00:49:31.928 --> 00:49:34.668]  People now, for the first time in modern history, don't trust either party.
[00:49:34.949 --> 00:49:39.469]  In the past, we always got fooled by the good cop, bad cop, charlatan parlor trick they played on us.
[00:49:40.190 --> 00:49:41.910]  And they could double-team us.
[00:49:43.064 --> 00:49:44.846]  And one party be in, one party be out.
[00:49:44.906 --> 00:49:45.887]  Not anymore, folks.
[00:49:45.907 --> 00:49:51.553]  Putting the Democrats in was some desperate move by the anti-war American people hoping they'd do the right thing.
[00:49:51.673 --> 00:49:53.135]  And the Democrats just said, no, no, no.
[00:49:53.335 --> 00:49:56.118]  We're going to put more troops in and we're all going to stay there forever.
[00:49:56.138 --> 00:49:59.042]  And people went, whoa.
[00:49:59.282 --> 00:50:00.863]  So I know you're mad like I am.
[00:50:00.884 --> 00:50:02.105]  I'm not talking about scum.
[00:50:02.145 --> 00:50:03.827]  I'm talking about people out there.
[00:50:05.117 --> 00:50:08.259]  They call themselves conservatives who are not conservatives.
[00:50:08.879 --> 00:50:12.761]  I'm talking about people out there who call themselves liberals, who aren't even liberals.
[00:50:12.821 --> 00:50:14.761]  And what do those terms even mean?
[00:50:14.982 --> 00:50:21.144]  You look at Hillary Clinton and George Bush, they vote almost identically on every issue but one or two.
[00:50:21.585 --> 00:50:28.608]  And those are political football issues that they never plan to settle because they want to keep using them to give you the illusion of choice.
[00:50:30.620 --> 00:50:35.101]  It's like if you go in a restaurant and they tell you you've got a choice of a hot dog or a hamburger.
[00:50:36.481 --> 00:50:38.041]  That's really no choice at all, folks.
[00:50:38.081 --> 00:50:40.042]  You need a choice not to go to that restaurant.
[00:50:40.402 --> 00:50:40.942]  You understand?
[00:50:40.962 --> 00:50:45.663]  Republicans and Democrats are just two different things on a menu at a certain restaurant.
[00:50:48.543 --> 00:50:50.663]  It's two different arms on the same creature.
[00:50:53.684 --> 00:50:57.705]  And do you know what tyranny and bondage is like?
[00:50:57.725 --> 00:50:59.225]  Because they're setting it up all around us.
[00:51:01.158 --> 00:51:07.445]  The Army Times reported this year that they will use foreign troops.
[00:51:08.045 --> 00:51:12.670]  Please don't, even if you believe what I'm saying, I want you to go pull it up.
[00:51:12.730 --> 00:51:14.432]  I mean, I want you to know it's true.
[00:51:14.452 --> 00:51:17.555]  Of course, they're busy saying how good it is, of course.
[00:51:18.336 --> 00:51:22.320]  See, we can take their news, we're telling you how good all this is, and then we can unspin it.
[00:51:25.247 --> 00:51:31.412]  Of course, they actually signed the deal four years ago to use Mexican and Canadian troops to, quote, patrol the U.S.
[00:51:31.672 --> 00:51:33.033]  and deal with American terrorists.
[00:51:33.294 --> 00:51:34.755]  Because foreigners will take your guns.
[00:51:35.655 --> 00:51:36.916]  Foreigners will do whatever they're told to do.
[00:51:37.137 --> 00:51:37.837]  All right, I promise.
[00:51:37.897 --> 00:51:39.759]  Nothing but open phones in the second hour.
[00:51:39.779 --> 00:51:41.680]  I know the phones have been loaded the whole show.
[00:51:41.700 --> 00:51:42.861]  We'll be right back.
[00:51:50.912 --> 00:51:51.952]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:51:52.052 --> 00:51:56.873]  Over the years, Genesis Communications Network has grown by leaps and bounds reaching millions of listeners.
[00:51:56.974 --> 00:51:59.874]  The impact on political and social issues have been enormous.
[00:51:59.994 --> 00:52:04.015]  Businesses associated with the network have grown to become valuable enterprises.
[00:52:04.315 --> 00:52:10.337]  If you are accredited and have an entrepreneurial spirit, National Radio may be the opportunity you're looking for.
[00:52:10.517 --> 00:52:12.077]  Call me today at 877-996-4327, extension 101.
[00:52:12.117 --> 00:52:14.498]  For more information, that's 877-996-4327, extension 101.
[00:52:22.012 --> 00:52:22.733]  We're good to go.
[00:52:52.495 --> 00:52:54.656]  He stands for truth.
[00:52:55.276 --> 00:52:57.577]  He stands for justice.
[00:52:58.278 --> 00:53:01.159]  He stands for what's right.
[00:53:01.339 --> 00:53:03.880]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:53:04.221 --> 00:53:06.702]  Call Alex now, toll free at 877-590-5525.
[00:53:06.862 --> 00:53:11.544]  Now live from Austin, Texas, here's Alex Jones.
[00:53:20.186 --> 00:53:28.050]  Look, I'm just some average person who 14 years ago found out there were public, public plans to get rid of our sovereignty, take all our freedoms.
[00:53:28.810 --> 00:53:29.110]  Why?
[00:53:29.130 --> 00:53:31.591]  Because powerful, rich people want more control.
[00:53:31.611 --> 00:53:32.552]  That's what they do.
[00:53:32.572 --> 00:53:34.713]  They conquest.
[00:53:34.733 --> 00:53:39.875]  12 years ago, I got on air.
[00:53:39.895 --> 00:53:41.356]  10, 11 years ago, I got on talk radio.
[00:53:42.236 --> 00:53:43.977]  My country's gone.
[00:53:44.037 --> 00:53:44.478]  I'm upset.
[00:53:44.498 --> 00:53:45.178]  I'm sad about it.
[00:53:46.520 --> 00:53:51.521]  The elite confuses with fake left-right discussions and debates when they own both sides.
[00:53:51.541 --> 00:53:56.082]  I mean, I could talk for two hours about the execution of Saddam Hussein.
[00:53:56.983 --> 00:53:58.183]  A horrible individual.
[00:53:58.783 --> 00:54:02.484]  Compared to many in the region, quite a little schoolboy, though.
[00:54:04.965 --> 00:54:07.045]  I've got the Times of London here.
[00:54:07.185 --> 00:54:08.345]  I've got the London Independent.
[00:54:09.366 --> 00:54:10.186]  What are their headlines?
[00:54:12.105 --> 00:54:14.486]  He takes his secrets to the grave.
[00:54:14.506 --> 00:54:16.387]  Our complicity dies with him.
[00:54:17.527 --> 00:54:18.168]  Here's another one.
[00:54:19.468 --> 00:54:22.669]  A dictator created and destroyed by America.
[00:54:22.689 --> 00:54:27.051]  Saddam Hussein at the age of 18, the late 1950s.
[00:54:27.551 --> 00:54:29.012]  This is mainstream news, by the way.
[00:54:29.292 --> 00:54:30.373]  It's just back of the paper.
[00:54:31.933 --> 00:54:37.475]  And when I say back of the paper, I mean... It's in the news, but it's buried.
[00:54:37.515 --> 00:54:38.616]  It gets reported a few times.
[00:54:40.377 --> 00:54:41.017]  He was hired...
[00:54:42.423 --> 00:54:50.207]  Came from a good SUNY family, had good test scores, you know, 6'5 and 6'6 intimidating.
[00:54:51.448 --> 00:54:59.852]  They hired him as an assassin and for over a decade he killed and bombed and maimed and tortured as a CIA asset.
[00:55:01.292 --> 00:55:04.114]  Then our government helped get him in as the head of Bass Security, ran a coup.
[00:55:05.151 --> 00:55:06.612]  In 1979, he became dictator.
[00:55:06.632 --> 00:55:09.035]  He was given $30-plus billion to attack Iran.
[00:55:09.655 --> 00:55:16.101]  Our government gave him the set information, how to spray the gas, gave him the chemicals to make the gas.
[00:55:16.661 --> 00:55:18.863]  This, by the way, is all admitted.
[00:55:19.804 --> 00:55:21.305]  I've got news articles right here.
[00:55:21.325 --> 00:55:28.592]  I mean, I've known this for over 10 years, but the point is, it isn't like I'm telling you something that isn't admitted on record.
[00:55:30.717 --> 00:55:31.317]  Then U.S.
[00:55:31.377 --> 00:55:37.761]  Ambassador to Iraq, April Gillespie, five days before he rolled into Kuwait, said, We don't have a treaty with Kuwait.
[00:55:38.041 --> 00:55:38.741]  We do with you.
[00:55:38.761 --> 00:55:40.222]  It's the same with Iran.
[00:55:40.942 --> 00:55:42.803]  We don't get involved in inter-Arab affairs.
[00:55:42.823 --> 00:55:43.644]  And he said, Thank you.
[00:55:43.664 --> 00:55:44.484]  I'm going to invade.
[00:55:47.346 --> 00:55:48.847]  So he thought he was doing his job.
[00:55:51.348 --> 00:55:54.329]  His job was murdering and torturing and killing people.
[00:55:56.090 --> 00:55:59.032]  His job was keeping, quote, Islamic extremists under control.
[00:56:00.447 --> 00:56:03.028]  And the new policy started and said, we want Islamic extremists.
[00:56:03.048 --> 00:56:07.711]  We want the region broken up in sectarian violence and civil war.
[00:56:09.271 --> 00:56:10.752]  And Saddam Hussein had to go.
[00:56:11.032 --> 00:56:11.773]  And he did go.
[00:56:14.474 --> 00:56:25.920]  In the last three and a half years, 654,000, this is the British Medical Journal, highly respected non-partisan, did their own report, conservative, that's the conservative estimate,
[00:56:27.762 --> 00:56:30.623]  Over half a million dead Iraqis, and it will continue.
[00:56:30.663 --> 00:56:32.923]  Don't worry those of you that are out there that are pro-war.
[00:56:33.303 --> 00:56:34.743]  They don't care what the American people think.
[00:56:34.763 --> 00:56:42.405]  You're worried because 78% of Americans want out that your precious manhood war, you think it's manly to cheer for, it's going to end.
[00:56:42.445 --> 00:56:43.265]  It's not going to end.
[00:56:43.725 --> 00:56:46.685]  And don't worry, they're going to get rid of the border and legalize all the illegals.
[00:56:47.245 --> 00:56:50.466]  And don't worry, they're going to have more and more restrictive gun laws.
[00:56:50.966 --> 00:56:52.386]  You're going to get everything you want.
[00:56:52.426 --> 00:56:53.527]  Don't worry, okay?
[00:56:53.927 --> 00:56:55.767]  We probably won't save the country, all right?
[00:56:56.630 --> 00:56:57.550]  And don't worry.
[00:56:58.010 --> 00:57:01.651]  Our sons and daughters will be dying in Iraq 20 years from now, okay?
[00:57:02.072 --> 00:57:03.332]  Don't worry, all right?
[00:57:03.612 --> 00:57:05.733]  The elite's going to win, probably, all right?
[00:57:06.393 --> 00:57:06.893]  Don't worry.
[00:57:06.913 --> 00:57:08.253]  You'll get what you want, okay?
[00:57:08.954 --> 00:57:10.314]  Joe in Atlanta.
[00:57:12.154 --> 00:57:13.415]  You're on the air.
[00:57:13.455 --> 00:57:14.095]  Go ahead, Joe.
[00:57:17.016 --> 00:57:17.916]  All right.
[00:57:18.076 --> 00:57:20.737]  Well, we'll...
[00:57:22.631 --> 00:57:24.373]  Go ahead and go back to Joe.
[00:57:24.854 --> 00:57:25.434]  Joe, go ahead.
[00:57:25.915 --> 00:57:26.676]  Yeah, I'm here.
[00:57:26.756 --> 00:57:27.697]  Happy New Year, Alex.
[00:57:28.077 --> 00:57:32.523]  I know it's a sentiment I want to express, but I know it's not real.
[00:57:33.384 --> 00:57:35.066]  It's real in my heart.
[00:57:35.266 --> 00:57:36.567]  And the same thing with America.
[00:57:36.607 --> 00:57:37.749]  It's real in my heart.
[00:57:38.349 --> 00:57:39.689]  I believed in this country.
[00:57:39.749 --> 00:57:43.050]  I grew up and was taught, you know, what this country represented.
[00:57:43.130 --> 00:57:44.510]  And I've seen nothing of that.
[00:57:44.530 --> 00:57:49.151]  And I've seen nothing of that since I was an adolescent and started really looking and going.
[00:57:49.192 --> 00:57:50.492]  And this is just setting the table.
[00:57:50.532 --> 00:57:52.472]  See, I mean, this is... WTF!
[00:57:52.492 --> 00:57:52.592]  WTF!
[00:57:52.652 --> 00:57:55.433]  Well, you know, I'll tell you a little story.
[00:57:55.513 --> 00:57:58.033]  A year and a half ago, I was managing a help desk.
[00:57:58.134 --> 00:58:04.475]  And I was, you know, I gave my help desk people free reign to do whatever they wanted on the Internet as long as they took calls.
[00:58:05.075 --> 00:58:05.676]  We're good to go.
[00:58:33.698 --> 00:58:35.259]  Because that's one thing, Alex.
[00:58:36.079 --> 00:58:42.382]  It's entertaining to see someone actually say the things I want to get up on a podium and say.
[00:58:43.582 --> 00:58:50.465]  It's entertainment value to see someone express the anger and the frustration that I feel.
[00:58:50.645 --> 00:58:54.447]  I know there's one person out there that feels the same way I do.
[00:58:55.462 --> 00:59:03.024]  And, man, you opened my eyes and you connected all these little pieces that I saw orbiting independently.
[00:59:03.424 --> 00:59:04.404]  You connected them all.
[00:59:04.884 --> 00:59:08.545]  And this stuff has been going on since before the turn of the century.
[00:59:08.605 --> 00:59:10.205]  The groundwork is being laid.
[00:59:10.285 --> 00:59:12.045]  The families took control.
[00:59:12.065 --> 00:59:13.806]  And here we are.
[00:59:13.886 --> 00:59:14.426]  Here we are.
[00:59:15.186 --> 00:59:17.307]  Well, that's really good.
[00:59:17.407 --> 00:59:18.507]  I like it now.
[00:59:19.007 --> 00:59:24.168]  The one thing I don't understand, and I see a paradox in it,
[00:59:25.094 --> 00:59:29.156]  And just like I see a paradox in the no gays in the military.
[00:59:29.256 --> 00:59:30.417]  I have one gay son.
[00:59:30.437 --> 00:59:34.419]  I know he's not going in draft or no draft.
[00:59:35.191 --> 00:59:42.034]  I have one heterosexual son and I've told him, you know, you have to register anyways.
[00:59:42.114 --> 00:59:44.135]  I had to register when I was 18.
[00:59:44.535 --> 00:59:54.939]  But if you ever get called before a draft board, you better bring a buddy with you and you better French kiss him right there in front of the draft board.
[00:59:54.979 --> 00:59:56.200]  There's a dichotomy to it.
[00:59:56.240 --> 00:59:57.340]  There's a paradox to it.
[00:59:57.680 --> 00:59:58.361]  No, no, no.
[00:59:58.681 --> 01:00:00.761]  I hear you and I appreciate your call.
[01:00:00.802 --> 01:00:01.802]  That is an interesting idea.
[01:00:02.563 --> 01:00:09.647]  You know, they also won't let you in if you have so much credit card debt, so people are running up their credit card debts while they're in just to get out.
[01:00:09.967 --> 01:00:14.369]  By the way, there's a huge PR push, not just by Rangel, but the media.
[01:00:14.409 --> 01:00:15.169]  You see it everywhere.
[01:00:15.529 --> 01:00:18.051]  The head of the VA, the head of the Selective Service.
[01:00:18.111 --> 01:00:18.911]  Oh, we need a draft.
[01:00:18.971 --> 01:00:19.271]  It's good.
[01:00:19.291 --> 01:00:19.952]  We need a draft.
[01:00:21.252 --> 01:00:24.774]  They really are trying to set up a draft.
[01:00:25.334 --> 01:00:30.437]  But they already have a draft of people who've served one, two, three, four, starting their fifth tours now.
[01:00:31.454 --> 01:00:34.915]  That's never been done in World War II or Vietnam or Korea.
[01:00:34.935 --> 01:00:35.695]  It's incredible.
[01:00:36.596 --> 01:00:40.597]  Let's talk to Ronnie in Oklahoma.
[01:00:41.777 --> 01:00:43.178]  You're on the air, sir.
[01:00:43.258 --> 01:00:43.638]  Go ahead.
[01:00:44.158 --> 01:00:45.458]  How you doing, Alex?
[01:00:46.339 --> 01:00:46.879]  What's on your mind?
[01:00:48.024 --> 01:00:48.164]  Uh-huh.
[01:01:03.363 --> 01:01:07.484]  I thought that was pretty interesting, that you wouldn't even need to have a transponder to use the... Well, that's right.
[01:01:07.604 --> 01:01:09.525]  Every major road is going to be a toll road.
[01:01:09.545 --> 01:01:10.405]  It's all official.
[01:01:10.885 --> 01:01:13.426]  Every existing road, it's to fund the North American Union.
[01:01:13.506 --> 01:01:14.206]  It's in the official.
[01:01:14.226 --> 01:01:15.186]  You can go read the documents.
[01:01:15.646 --> 01:01:16.547]  SPP.gov.
[01:01:17.087 --> 01:01:29.310]  And they don't even need to have a transponder in your inspection sticker, or have you get the little Texas tag, or in Oklahoma, you know, they have another name for it, K-Tag, Smart Tag, Easy Pass.
[01:01:30.848 --> 01:01:37.952]  They're going to use the license plate on your car, and the feds have already nationwide got the cameras hooked into software.
[01:01:38.352 --> 01:01:41.054]  They can also use your cell phone to tax you as you drive.
[01:01:42.615 --> 01:01:43.515]  It's a control grid.
[01:01:43.575 --> 01:01:46.557]  I mean, I just read the industry publications seven, eight years ago.
[01:01:46.577 --> 01:01:50.399]  That's how I've been knowing this, and now everybody's going, wow, what you said is really happening.
[01:01:50.619 --> 01:01:52.260]  Yeah, folks, that's what's so frustrating.
[01:01:52.840 --> 01:01:58.904]  I mean, ten years ago they were saying we're going to just get rid of America, have a police state, world government, tax you on the roads,
[01:01:59.564 --> 01:02:04.689]  And then I would talk about it, and they'd go, oh, you're a kook, it doesn't exist, while they admitted it simultaneously.
[01:02:06.951 --> 01:02:12.896]  What do you think about the Free State Project moving up into the area of New Hampshire or Vermont?
[01:02:13.517 --> 01:02:15.338]  You know, I think stuff like that's a fine idea.
[01:02:15.458 --> 01:02:15.879]  Anything.
[01:02:15.919 --> 01:02:17.240]  Just standing up and resisting.
[01:02:17.620 --> 01:02:19.422]  Just getting involved in any capacity.
[01:02:20.459 --> 01:02:23.220]  Here's the way.
[01:02:23.280 --> 01:02:24.580]  Just standing up.
[01:02:24.620 --> 01:02:26.661]  Getting mad first.
[01:02:26.721 --> 01:02:28.541]  Hating the government is number one.
[01:02:28.561 --> 01:02:30.042]  The founding fathers said that was good.
[01:02:30.062 --> 01:02:32.162]  Today it's lick the government's boots.
[01:02:32.322 --> 01:02:34.703]  I'm going to hurry through your calls when we get back.
[01:02:34.823 --> 01:02:37.184]  Dan, Robert, many others, stay with us.
[01:02:37.304 --> 01:02:43.045]  I want to hear what you think the biggest stories of 2006 have been and what's most important to you.
[01:02:43.085 --> 01:02:43.926]  We'll be right back.
[01:02:43.946 --> 01:02:44.406]  Stay with us.
[01:02:55.291 --> 01:02:58.492]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[01:02:58.832 --> 01:03:00.773]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[01:03:01.133 --> 01:03:08.816]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:03:09.476 --> 01:03:16.519]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:03:16.919 --> 01:03:19.840]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran.
[01:03:20.261 --> 01:03:22.582]  A White House program to disseminate fake news.
[01:03:22.982 --> 01:03:23.862]  NSA spies.
[01:03:25.004 --> 01:03:28.346]  The latest 9-11 information and much, much more.
[01:03:28.646 --> 01:03:32.167]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:03:32.627 --> 01:03:34.548]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:03:34.868 --> 01:03:38.769]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:03:51.713 --> 01:03:52.714]  Ted Anderson for Midas.
[01:03:52.755 --> 01:03:53.075]  December 29, 2006.
[01:03:53.135 --> 01:03:53.335]  Gold 63370.
[01:03:53.375 --> 01:03:55.819]  Ounce gold coins are at 65433, 32982 for half and 16491 for quarter ounce.
[01:03:55.859 --> 01:03:56.419]  That's 65433, 32982 and 16491.
[01:04:06.853 --> 01:04:08.714]  1971, Nixon closes the gold window.
[01:04:08.794 --> 01:04:09.634]  Fiat currency.
[01:04:10.395 --> 01:04:14.236]  1920s, the German mark explodes from 75 to 23 trillion.
[01:04:14.576 --> 01:04:16.437]  1995, gold doubles against the Mexican peso.
[01:04:17.177 --> 01:04:20.359]  1997, gold increases 82% over the Indonesian rupee.
[01:04:20.379 --> 01:04:23.380]  1998, gold jumps two-thirds over the Russian ruble.
[01:04:24.040 --> 01:04:26.781]  2002, the Argentine peso loses a fifth of its value to gold.
[01:04:27.021 --> 01:04:32.183]  2006, the last superpower, the USA's mighty dollar, loses over half to gold and other raw goods.
[01:04:32.344 --> 01:04:33.624]  Could government let this happen?
[01:04:33.764 --> 01:04:35.705]  Without immediate backing, how much will it lose?
[01:04:35.985 --> 01:04:43.033]  Midas has Nick Bereshoff's report covering the loss of purchasing power, fat tail events, bull market economic vulnerabilities, and gold-oil relationship.
[01:04:43.073 --> 01:04:44.815]  You've lost half of your purchasing power.
[01:04:44.855 --> 01:04:46.017]  Call 800-686-2237 before the rest disappears.
[01:04:46.037 --> 01:04:46.357]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:04:52.677 --> 01:04:54.258]  The statistics are heart-wrenching.
[01:04:54.578 --> 01:05:03.186]  According to the CWC, of the 43 million people who have served in the major wars, from the Revolutionary War to the Gulf War, 3 million never made it home alive.
[01:05:03.546 --> 01:05:09.291]  Most likely, each one of us can say we either knew someone who served or know a brave soul who is currently serving our country.
[01:05:09.672 --> 01:05:15.637]  Now there is a unique way to pay tribute to the courageous men and women who spend their lives protecting our freedom and to those
[01:05:15.657 --> 01:05:16.197]  We're good to go.

[01:06:58.173 --> 01:06:59.473]  Raging for the truth.
[01:06:59.493 --> 01:07:04.035]  Exposing corruption.
[01:07:04.075 --> 01:07:06.376]  Dismantling the false, led by paradigm.
[01:07:06.456 --> 01:07:07.777]  He's Alex Jones.
[01:07:20.807 --> 01:07:23.529]  That's all I try to do.
[01:07:23.749 --> 01:07:24.850]  That's all I do.
[01:07:24.890 --> 01:07:27.412]  Let's go back to your calls.
[01:07:27.432 --> 01:07:30.095]  What do you think the most important stories of 2006 were?
[01:07:30.115 --> 01:07:31.996]  And I don't mean the biggest stories.
[01:07:32.037 --> 01:07:37.421]  You know, some bimbo son dies in a drug overdose in the Bahamas.
[01:07:37.521 --> 01:07:39.423]  Hey, that's not news to me, folks.
[01:07:39.483 --> 01:07:40.564]  I don't think it's news to you.
[01:07:40.964 --> 01:07:42.346]  Why does the media try to make it news?
[01:07:43.166 --> 01:07:43.867]  Or O.J.
[01:07:43.907 --> 01:07:46.009]  Simpson trying to sell a sickening evil book.
[01:07:46.812 --> 01:07:47.613]  That's not news to me.
[01:07:47.633 --> 01:07:48.774]  I don't think it should be news to you.
[01:07:48.794 --> 01:07:49.575]  No, no, no.
[01:07:49.595 --> 01:07:52.199]  We focus on things that really matter here.
[01:07:52.559 --> 01:07:55.022]  And I'd like to hear from you what you think really matters.
[01:07:55.062 --> 01:07:56.984]  I don't plan to have a monopoly on that.
[01:07:57.024 --> 01:07:59.568]  Let's talk to Dan in New York.
[01:07:59.608 --> 01:08:00.348]  Dan, you're on the air.
[01:08:00.368 --> 01:08:00.909]  Thanks for holding.
[01:08:01.910 --> 01:08:02.892]  No problem.
[01:08:02.932 --> 01:08:03.392]  Thank you.
[01:08:03.813 --> 01:08:05.294]  Happy New Year to you and yours.
[01:08:05.455 --> 01:08:06.416]  Same to you, my friend.
[01:08:07.148 --> 01:08:09.611]  Hopefully we can make it a happy new year in 07.
[01:08:10.352 --> 01:08:14.576]  Like you've said in the past, there's an exponential awakening of people to the truth.
[01:08:14.656 --> 01:08:15.898]  Yeah, I should be more positive.
[01:08:15.938 --> 01:08:16.879]  I mean, people are waking up.
[01:08:16.919 --> 01:08:23.486]  The problem is the government's totally controlled and just says on every issue, we don't care what you want, we don't care what's constitutional, we're moving forward.
[01:08:24.235 --> 01:08:28.737]  Well, hopefully we can eventually get this critical mess of sheeples to wake up.
[01:08:28.877 --> 01:08:32.678]  You know, the possibility of loose change coming to theaters is pretty exciting.
[01:08:32.698 --> 01:08:39.000]  So the biggest story is hard to choose with this plethora of insanity that we deal with here.
[01:08:40.001 --> 01:08:42.502]  I would have to say the Military Commissions Act.
[01:08:43.082 --> 01:08:48.864]  HR 6166, for those that don't know or don't even know what the bill was, why don't you tell them what it did?
[01:08:49.622 --> 01:08:54.344]  Well, this did what Hitler and Stalin and all the tyrants of the past never did.
[01:08:54.764 --> 01:09:11.930]  This is codified into law that the United States government can secretly arrest, secretly try, during your trial they can torture you, and then use that info against you, you basically have no defense, no way to defend yourself, and then they can secretly execute you.
[01:09:12.610 --> 01:09:13.431]  And it's U.S.
[01:09:13.651 --> 01:09:14.171]  citizens.
[01:09:14.251 --> 01:09:15.451]  It's clearly in there.
[01:09:15.611 --> 01:09:16.792]  All the law experts have read it.
[01:09:17.072 --> 01:09:27.577]  Before they even wrote their analysis, within a day of getting the bill, I wrote the analysis that you can compare to the experts at the law schools who also did the same analysis.
[01:09:28.077 --> 01:09:29.438]  And I'm not tooting my horn.
[01:09:29.858 --> 01:09:33.719]  I learned how to read legislation, especially police state legislation.
[01:09:33.739 --> 01:09:34.780]  You know, I wrote an analysis...
[01:09:35.540 --> 01:09:38.162]  Yeah, I mean, it's amazing.
[01:09:38.262 --> 01:09:40.663]  It's our learning doublespeak.
[01:09:40.704 --> 01:09:47.808]  You know, they say it doesn't apply to U.S.
[01:09:47.828 --> 01:09:48.328]  citizens.
[01:09:48.368 --> 01:09:50.470]  Well, if they strip you of your U.S.
[01:09:50.490 --> 01:09:52.591]  citizenship, technically that's true.
[01:09:52.611 --> 01:09:57.214]  Which is what they've argued in the federal court cases, in which they've already done to Padilla and others.
[01:09:58.118 --> 01:09:58.418]  I know.
[01:09:58.758 --> 01:10:04.221]  It's amazing, you know, Bush saying, you know, when we're talking about war, we're really talking about peace.
[01:10:04.461 --> 01:10:10.083]  Well, notice how all the different law enforcement agencies and the rest of it now are calling all crime terrorism?
[01:10:11.084 --> 01:10:11.424]  Oh, yeah.
[01:10:11.624 --> 01:10:13.345]  It doesn't really matter what it is.
[01:10:13.385 --> 01:10:14.725]  Like you said, the Patriot Act.
[01:10:15.046 --> 01:10:19.027]  Have they ever used the Patriot Act to do anything to stop terrorism?
[01:10:19.067 --> 01:10:19.227]  No.
[01:10:19.247 --> 01:10:23.929]  No, it's never been used in one case, but tens of thousands of non-terror-related cases.
[01:10:24.290 --> 01:10:24.910]  Absolutely.
[01:10:26.218 --> 01:10:26.998]  Great points.
[01:10:27.058 --> 01:10:28.219]  I appreciate your call.
[01:10:28.239 --> 01:10:31.679]  Let's go ahead and talk to Robert in Cedar Park.
[01:10:31.719 --> 01:10:32.800]  You're on the air, sir.
[01:10:32.840 --> 01:10:33.180]  Welcome.
[01:10:34.080 --> 01:10:43.622]  I think the biggest story of the year, although it's probably equal with what the gentleman was just talking about, is the domestic spying.
[01:10:45.683 --> 01:10:49.584]  Well, I mean, they admit that they listen to cell phone conversations without warrants.
[01:10:50.299 --> 01:10:53.561]  They admit that they scan your license plates without warrants.
[01:10:54.022 --> 01:10:57.704]  They admit they use your computer microphone to listen to you without warrants.
[01:10:58.005 --> 01:11:01.887]  They admit that they track everybody in illegal databases.
[01:11:02.107 --> 01:11:04.349]  But I guess it is big news that they finally admitted it.
[01:11:05.250 --> 01:11:10.473]  Well, I called you back in 2000 when you were on another radio station.
[01:11:11.294 --> 01:11:14.316]  And I told you about I make antennas.
[01:11:14.376 --> 01:11:16.278]  I've built antennas for a big...
[01:11:18.968 --> 01:11:21.510]  Electronics manufacturer.
[01:11:22.010 --> 01:11:29.616]  They were working on digital encryption coming right through your electrical lines.
[01:11:29.796 --> 01:11:38.642]  Basically, it makes your house transparent when they use these things on you.
[01:11:38.922 --> 01:11:42.625]  They're developing databases, and they're getting better at it.
[01:11:42.665 --> 01:11:45.007]  The only thing that's kept them from doing it so far
[01:11:45.891 --> 01:11:52.816]  And from really cracking down on us so far is the fact that there's a level of incompetence that they can't overcome.
[01:11:52.876 --> 01:11:53.556]  Well, that's right.
[01:11:54.017 --> 01:11:57.759]  And everybody in the government isn't some willing, you know, evil person.
[01:11:57.779 --> 01:12:07.146]  So they have to have TV shows like 24 and all the other TV shows promoting torture, warrantless searches, selling the public on the new paradigm.
[01:12:08.507 --> 01:12:12.289]  Well, they're really planning on doing it.
[01:12:12.909 --> 01:12:19.372]  I think there's probably going to be some things come along to stop them naturally.
[01:12:20.053 --> 01:12:25.235]  But I tell you, before you and I die, it's coming.
[01:12:25.435 --> 01:12:30.358]  They're coming for us, and they're going to try it.
[01:12:30.398 --> 01:12:34.039]  People listening to Alex Jones right now think he's a nut.
[01:12:34.680 --> 01:12:35.420]  Well, you're wrong.
[01:12:35.840 --> 01:12:37.121]  Alex Jones is not a nut.
[01:12:37.930 --> 01:12:41.773]  Alex Jones is very sane, passionate, to a fault.
[01:12:42.454 --> 01:12:51.441]  And I tell you this as a sober individual who's in engineering, and I'm working with this technology right now.
[01:12:51.741 --> 01:12:53.522]  I hope I don't go to hell for having done it.
[01:12:54.403 --> 01:12:57.445]  But they're coming for us, and Alex is right.
[01:12:57.946 --> 01:13:01.949]  And just because you might be wrong on a couple of things doesn't mean that you're wrong totally.
[01:13:02.249 --> 01:13:03.350]  Hey, I wish I was wrong.
[01:13:03.410 --> 01:13:05.832]  Every single night when I go to bed, I wish this stuff wasn't true.
[01:13:07.279 --> 01:13:10.424]  I mean, I wish this country wasn't in such dire peril.
[01:13:10.464 --> 01:13:12.687]  I appreciate your call.
[01:13:12.747 --> 01:13:14.610]  Let's go ahead and take some calls.
[01:13:14.670 --> 01:13:15.592]  Caller, what's your name?
[01:13:15.612 --> 01:13:16.413]  Where are you calling from?
[01:13:17.995 --> 01:13:18.836]  Caller, what's your name?
[01:13:18.857 --> 01:13:19.638]  Where are you calling from?
[01:13:20.348 --> 01:13:21.148]  Yes, this is Henry.
[01:13:21.909 --> 01:13:23.149]  I'm over here to go, Alex.
[01:13:23.489 --> 01:13:23.949]  Okay, sir.
[01:13:23.969 --> 01:13:25.530]  Do me a favor and turn your radio off.
[01:13:25.630 --> 01:13:25.710]  Okay.
[01:13:25.730 --> 01:13:25.850]  Sure.
[01:13:25.890 --> 01:13:26.390]  What's your name?
[01:13:27.290 --> 01:13:27.450]  Sure.
[01:13:27.470 --> 01:13:27.891]  Hey, Alex.
[01:13:28.171 --> 01:13:28.851]  You having a good year?
[01:13:29.731 --> 01:13:30.631]  Yeah.
[01:13:30.651 --> 01:13:32.412]  2006 has been a good year for me and my family.
[01:13:32.432 --> 01:13:34.113]  Not for this country overall.
[01:13:34.133 --> 01:13:34.813]  What's on your mind?
[01:13:35.273 --> 01:13:35.633]  Okay.
[01:13:35.673 --> 01:13:37.914]  Well, I hope you keep on trucking the way you're doing.
[01:13:37.934 --> 01:13:38.694]  You're doing a great job.
[01:13:39.154 --> 01:13:45.116]  What's your take on this bill that Charlie Rangel is putting through for draft?
[01:13:45.156 --> 01:13:46.437]  The National Service Act?
[01:13:46.457 --> 01:13:46.717]  Right.
[01:13:49.244 --> 01:13:51.185]  It's 18 to 42.
[01:13:51.745 --> 01:13:54.786]  There's another bill that's 18 to 49.
[01:13:55.547 --> 01:13:58.628]  And it is everything the government's been gearing up for all along.
[01:13:59.148 --> 01:14:01.269]  Compulsory National Service, i.e.
[01:14:01.329 --> 01:14:01.989]  conscription, i.e.
[01:14:02.769 --> 01:14:03.230]  the draft.
[01:14:04.170 --> 01:14:06.531]  A rose by any other name is still a rose.
[01:14:06.991 --> 01:14:07.391]  Right.
[01:14:07.451 --> 01:14:13.574]  And notice how suddenly all these big Republicans and Democrats and the head of the Selective Service are all saying how we need it.
[01:14:13.594 --> 01:14:14.394]  Oh, yeah.
[01:14:15.271 --> 01:14:20.554]  Do you think that might be something that might finally wake the public up when they start drafting these guys?
[01:14:20.934 --> 01:14:25.396]  Yes, the problem is the draft will follow another government-sponsored terror attack.
[01:14:26.596 --> 01:14:31.239]  They'll do it right after they blow up a city or do some other horrible action.
[01:14:31.439 --> 01:14:32.759]  Kind of like a tripwire thing, then.
[01:14:33.380 --> 01:14:40.083]  They'll have to get the public all emotional for the next phase before they go off and invade a whole new slew of countries.
[01:14:40.603 --> 01:14:43.645]  Let's go ahead and talk to Tom in North Austin.
[01:14:43.705 --> 01:14:44.185]  Welcome, sir.
[01:14:45.154 --> 01:14:48.357]  Yes, I was just hearing you talk about asylum a while ago.
[01:14:48.377 --> 01:14:56.945]  I'm old enough, I've been around a little while, and I heard Mr. Byrd about a year ago come out on C-SPAN, and he had a stack of papers about three inches tall.
[01:14:58.268 --> 01:15:03.451]  He was talking about what we give so that I'm in the way of all kinds of weapons of mass destruction.
[01:15:03.491 --> 01:15:06.793]  Hell, in 94 they gave him a bunch of anthrax and botulism.
[01:15:06.833 --> 01:15:08.894]  Yeah, he was talking about the chemical weapons and all.
[01:15:08.914 --> 01:15:11.576]  Yeah, that goes back to the 80s, Don Rumsfeld, yeah.
[01:15:11.716 --> 01:15:16.979]  They had pictures of Rumsfeld and them all giving it, you know, making him a big shot.
[01:15:17.845 --> 01:15:18.465]  Anyhow, they made it.
[01:15:18.486 --> 01:15:20.727]  Sir, they recruited him when he was 18 years of age.
[01:15:20.767 --> 01:15:20.927]  Yeah.
[01:15:21.287 --> 01:15:24.029]  I mean, you know, a lot of people don't know that.
[01:15:24.089 --> 01:15:26.070]  I mean, yeah, I mean, I don't care that they hung the guy.
[01:15:26.090 --> 01:15:27.491]  Well, listen, I'm going to hold you over.
[01:15:27.511 --> 01:15:28.111]  I agree with you.
[01:15:28.131 --> 01:15:30.492]  We've got a breaking on him, but yeah, that's the point.
[01:15:30.512 --> 01:15:31.453]  That's the point.
[01:15:31.533 --> 01:15:32.653]  Real quick, now hang up.
[01:15:32.794 --> 01:15:33.834]  Sure, go ahead.
[01:15:33.854 --> 01:15:37.536]  But anyhow, you remember when Ross Perot was running for president?
[01:15:37.676 --> 01:15:37.936]  Yes.
[01:15:38.557 --> 01:15:42.879]  He told Larry King, he said, when they pass that master, they'll hear a great sucking sound.
[01:15:43.640 --> 01:15:44.100]  He's right.
[01:15:52.184 --> 01:15:56.205]  People who use Cardabite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[01:15:56.425 --> 01:15:59.826]  For over five years, Cardabite has proven itself time-tested.
[01:16:00.006 --> 01:16:03.487]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardabite.
[01:16:03.743 --> 01:16:06.985]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[01:16:07.005 --> 01:16:12.488]  This basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the disease that we see.
[01:16:12.508 --> 01:16:22.154]  When we do our program, you know, in herbal formulas like Cardavite, and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill now going for a regular jog a few months later, we know we're doing something right.
[01:16:22.274 --> 01:16:23.555]  It's a well-thought-out formula.
[01:16:23.595 --> 01:16:29.058]  I mean, the idea of it working on yeast and metals both at the same time and liver function is dead on.
[01:16:29.546 --> 01:16:33.988]  You'll find, I think, that it'll work more than just on heart problems and circulation problems.
[01:16:34.008 --> 01:16:35.449]  It'll work on other problems as well.
[01:16:35.589 --> 01:16:39.471]  For more information, call 1-877-928-8822 or visit our website at www.heartdrop.com.
[01:16:39.491 --> 01:16:40.351]  That toll-free number again, 1-877-928-8822.
[01:16:52.265 --> 01:16:57.030]  Times are tough right now, but there are a lot of different ways to get ourselves out of this mess.
[01:16:57.270 --> 01:17:01.254]  Providing for our own food, water, and power are a good start.
[01:17:01.514 --> 01:17:07.800]  As you may have heard by now, Ken's Solar has been configuring alternative energy packages for over a decade.
[01:17:08.060 --> 01:17:12.424]  One of Ken's most popular items right now is the new solar-powered generator.
[01:17:12.624 --> 01:17:17.909]  For a lot less than you'd expect, this portable system can chop up nearly a third of your electric bill.
[01:17:18.169 --> 01:17:19.669]  Get a solar-powered generator now from
[01:17:51.346 --> 01:17:55.832]  I'm Richard Boggs, founder and CEO of one of the largest tax resolution firms in the country.
[01:18:07.225 --> 01:18:07.405]  Thank you.

[01:18:54.674 --> 01:18:56.615]  Do you know the truth about breast cancer?
[01:18:57.116 --> 01:18:59.557]  Do you realize that the race for the cure is over?
[01:19:00.318 --> 01:19:08.743]  The best-kept secret in the world today is that now it's possible to kill cancer without personal suffering, mutilation, and poisoning of your entire system.
[01:19:09.704 --> 01:19:14.567]  Now it's cancer's turn to die with LaysMed Incorporated's patented methodology.

[01:19:16.369 --> 01:19:16.409]  702-953-0267.
[01:19:38.883 --> 01:19:42.944]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:20:02.168 --> 01:20:03.648]  Corruption never had a worse enemy.
[01:20:03.668 --> 01:20:05.829]  You're locked in to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:28.922 --> 01:20:30.543]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:20:30.603 --> 01:20:33.626]  Final half hour of my last transmission of the year.
[01:20:33.666 --> 01:20:43.334]  I'll be back live next Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m., right here out of the studios of NewsRadio 590 KLBJ, syndicated via Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:20:43.354 --> 01:20:45.196]  We'll be taking calls from Sam, John, and others.
[01:20:45.596 --> 01:20:47.638]  I didn't like having to cut that last caller off.
[01:20:47.678 --> 01:20:50.020]  I wanted to hear what he had to say.
[01:20:51.021 --> 01:20:53.023]  I mean, I didn't really talk a lot about Saddam today.
[01:20:53.516 --> 01:21:07.204]  Because it's a very complex issue, and if I was going to attempt to really lay out the case of what really happened, it would take a few hours, because I don't like to just give you a few facts and then hope you go off my claims.
[01:21:07.384 --> 01:21:09.866]  I want to prove what I'm saying to you.
[01:21:10.086 --> 01:21:22.974]  Do you understand that the major newspapers in this country have admitted, the major history books that have been written on the subject admit, the declassified documents admit, but still maybe one out of a hundred knows that
[01:21:23.729 --> 01:21:31.012]  That Saddam Hussein wasn't just recruited in 1979 when he had a coup d'etat and took over Iraq.
[01:21:31.072 --> 01:21:40.456]  He was hired as an 18-year-old enlistee in the Iraqi military by the CIA, taken to Egypt for four years of training.
[01:21:41.757 --> 01:21:49.860]  And the guy was hell on wheels, assassinating, killing, torturing, and they told the Ba'athists, well, quit killing you if you put Saddam in as the head of Ba'athist security.
[01:21:50.512 --> 01:21:51.253]  If you work with us.
[01:22:20.916 --> 01:22:35.562]  Say in Chicago, who had ordered dozens of deaths and bank robberies and hijackings and killings over a 20-year career, was finally caught red-handed and sent to the lethal injection chair.
[01:22:36.183 --> 01:22:37.043]  No, I'd be happy.
[01:22:37.423 --> 01:22:38.444]  Same thing with Saddam.
[01:22:40.184 --> 01:22:50.449]  But if his judge and those that stood around saying how bad he was was the Don of Chicago, his boss, I'd say, this is ridiculous!
[01:22:51.149 --> 01:22:52.429]  This is unbelievable!
[01:22:53.730 --> 01:22:56.610]  So, again, in politics, it isn't cut and dry.
[01:22:56.630 --> 01:23:00.911]  And in geopolitical machinations, it's complex.
[01:23:01.891 --> 01:23:03.572]  And the world's a big place.
[01:23:03.592 --> 01:23:04.592]  A lot of things happen in it.
[01:23:04.932 --> 01:23:07.473]  I'm not blaming you that you don't know all the details.
[01:23:07.533 --> 01:23:08.673]  I mean, this is my job.
[01:23:08.693 --> 01:23:11.653]  This is what I do seven days a week, 365 days a year.
[01:23:12.634 --> 01:23:13.534]  I mean, I study this.
[01:23:13.554 --> 01:23:14.194]  This is what I do.
[01:23:15.084 --> 01:23:21.346]  But still, folks, if you're going to have a position on Iraq, I mean, there are people calling to talk radio, I'm glad they killed him.
[01:23:21.426 --> 01:23:22.627]  I'm feeling good right now.
[01:23:22.947 --> 01:23:25.188]  Man, I tell you, this means the war was worth it all.
[01:23:25.428 --> 01:23:26.648]  We killed him!
[01:23:27.068 --> 01:23:27.629]  Good!
[01:23:30.190 --> 01:23:33.891]  Our government's policy is not for the Iraqi people.
[01:23:33.951 --> 01:23:36.712]  It is to break down a first world nation into a third world country.
[01:23:37.752 --> 01:23:39.693]  There were 25 million Iraqis.
[01:23:40.842 --> 01:23:40.922]  In 1990.
[01:23:41.062 --> 01:23:49.266]  It was a first world country with rock and roll music on the radio, and Christian and Jewish synagogues all over the country, and one of the freest nations in the Middle East.
[01:23:49.286 --> 01:23:49.806]  Did you know that?
[01:23:51.767 --> 01:23:53.128]  It was the leader of the Middle East.
[01:23:53.708 --> 01:23:55.549]  It was like Serbia was the leader in Eastern Europe.
[01:23:56.489 --> 01:23:57.690]  Not since Slobo's good.
[01:23:57.750 --> 01:23:58.610]  Not since Saddam's good.
[01:23:58.630 --> 01:24:05.173]  The point is they're taken down because the global crime syndicate that's much bigger and badder than they are doesn't want anybody who's independent.
[01:24:06.294 --> 01:24:08.495]  They want to take down all these so-called rogue nations.
[01:24:10.507 --> 01:24:13.350]  And the goal in Iraq is sectarian violence.
[01:24:13.730 --> 01:24:16.573]  The goal is having them all war with each other.
[01:24:16.613 --> 01:24:21.777]  The goal is the oil not flowing so you have artificial scarcity and the oil companies in OPEC can make more money.
[01:24:21.797 --> 01:24:23.439]  Remember Saddam in 1990?
[01:24:23.559 --> 01:24:25.440]  I mean, go to the library.
[01:24:25.520 --> 01:24:26.762]  Pull up the microfilm.
[01:24:27.142 --> 01:24:28.283]  I mean, I actually do this.
[01:24:29.003 --> 01:24:30.545]  I send my researchers and we do this.
[01:24:30.925 --> 01:24:31.846]  This is what we do.
[01:24:32.226 --> 01:24:37.451]  Because you can't get that on the Internet, though Google's now digitizing all newspapers going back for 100 years.
[01:24:37.858 --> 01:24:39.600]  They're supposedly going to be done with it in six months.
[01:24:39.800 --> 01:24:40.481]  That's incredible.
[01:24:40.801 --> 01:24:42.102]  I can't wait for that.
[01:24:42.403 --> 01:24:45.586]  No more going down to the UT library, which is hellish.
[01:24:45.946 --> 01:24:46.947]  It just takes hours.
[01:24:47.047 --> 01:24:50.030]  But I'm digressing.
[01:24:50.070 --> 01:24:54.415]  The point is, you can go and read where they're all mad at him in 1990.
[01:24:54.715 --> 01:24:56.877]  And he's going, hey, I owe the U.S.
[01:24:56.897 --> 01:24:57.458]  $34 billion.
[01:24:57.478 --> 01:24:57.838]  $34 billion.
[01:24:59.105 --> 01:25:00.545]  I owe Europe tens of billions.
[01:25:00.885 --> 01:25:02.526]  You gave me the loans for the war.
[01:25:02.826 --> 01:25:07.587]  Of course I'm breaking my agreements with OPEC and pumping more oil and driving down prices.
[01:25:07.607 --> 01:25:11.648]  Remember you were paying like 92 cents a gallon for 87 octane?
[01:25:13.428 --> 01:25:14.628]  That's why they set him up.
[01:25:14.688 --> 01:25:17.089]  That's why they tricked him into invading Kuwait.
[01:25:18.649 --> 01:25:20.830]  Because he was our asset.
[01:25:20.870 --> 01:25:21.910]  He thought it was okay.
[01:25:22.370 --> 01:25:25.110]  Because he was pumping too much oil to pay off his debts.
[01:25:26.271 --> 01:25:27.411]  Driving down the prices.
[01:25:28.047 --> 01:25:30.868]  Now, I remember that, but I didn't believe my memory.
[01:25:30.908 --> 01:25:34.248]  I went and pulled the articles for an upcoming film I'm making.
[01:25:34.688 --> 01:25:36.749]  But I mean, I want you to go read that.
[01:25:36.829 --> 01:25:38.769]  I want you to go find that out.
[01:25:39.129 --> 01:25:40.650]  That's one of the big reasons this happened.
[01:25:40.830 --> 01:25:44.770]  And now they're going to use Iraq as a base in the future to control that region.
[01:25:44.850 --> 01:25:47.291]  And the goal is civil war.
[01:25:47.551 --> 01:25:49.531]  They want the Arabs all killing each other.
[01:25:49.911 --> 01:25:51.992]  So I don't want to hear this, we're there to give them democracy.
[01:25:52.912 --> 01:25:56.233]  There were 25 million Iraqis 16 years ago.
[01:25:56.273 --> 01:25:57.633]  Guess how many Iraqis there are now?
[01:25:59.118 --> 01:25:59.518]  22 million.
[01:25:59.998 --> 01:26:01.499]  Three million of them went somewhere.
[01:26:01.519 --> 01:26:06.200]  I mean, my gosh, Hitler killed millions.
[01:26:07.861 --> 01:26:13.843]  But you see, Hitler lost, so we got to write the history books and say he was bad, which he was.
[01:26:15.143 --> 01:26:16.184]  But not in this case, man.
[01:26:16.224 --> 01:26:19.545]  It just goes on and on and on, and the globalists write the history books.
[01:26:20.225 --> 01:26:20.785]  That's sick.
[01:26:20.825 --> 01:26:24.946]  Let's go ahead and talk to Sam in Las Vegas, Nevada.
[01:26:25.247 --> 01:26:26.347]  You're on the air, Sam.
[01:26:27.014 --> 01:26:30.335]  Hey, I want you to just keep on keeping on into the new year, you nut.
[01:26:30.355 --> 01:26:31.115]  Will you do that?
[01:26:32.495 --> 01:26:33.055]  Sure, I will.
[01:26:33.075 --> 01:26:34.396]  Make sure you keep it up.
[01:26:34.456 --> 01:26:34.896]  I love it.
[01:26:35.736 --> 01:26:37.436]  Okay, give me some facts where I'm a nut.
[01:26:37.876 --> 01:26:38.897]  Give me some facts where I'm not.
[01:26:38.917 --> 01:26:40.097]  I don't have an inside job.
[01:26:40.137 --> 01:26:41.137]  You're a freaking nut.
[01:26:41.217 --> 01:26:43.017]  Keep on keeping on into 2007.
[01:26:44.098 --> 01:26:46.898]  Well, Sam, this is Troy who claims he calls from West Virginia.
[01:26:46.918 --> 01:26:50.619]  Why don't you just... I mean, I'm sure that's a fake name, too, but we don't screen calls.
[01:26:50.679 --> 01:26:52.780]  Why do you feel you have to call up and lie about who you are?
[01:26:52.800 --> 01:26:54.720]  Just keep on keeping on.
[01:26:55.512 --> 01:26:56.753]  Keep on keeping on.
[01:26:56.773 --> 01:26:59.274]  But I'm going to ask you a question, Troy from West Virginia.
[01:26:59.735 --> 01:27:02.856]  Why don't you just call in with your real name?
[01:27:02.876 --> 01:27:04.477]  We didn't screen your call when you called, did we?
[01:27:06.899 --> 01:27:07.399]  No, you didn't.
[01:27:08.580 --> 01:27:09.861]  Okay, so I'm going to ask you a question.
[01:27:09.901 --> 01:27:10.841]  You can call me.
[01:27:10.861 --> 01:27:19.987]  So you're saying I'm a nut because... Because I was told by GCN I can't call anymore because I tore you up the last time I talked to you, so they will not take my phone calls.
[01:27:20.287 --> 01:27:21.107]  There's your answer.
[01:27:21.608 --> 01:27:23.409]  Keep on keeping on into the new year.
[01:27:23.993 --> 01:27:24.634]  Well, wait a minute.
[01:27:24.714 --> 01:27:26.335]  We just asked if we screened your calls.
[01:27:29.598 --> 01:27:34.864]  I remember, I think you sent an email claiming that it happened, and I think the rule is you can't call every day.
[01:27:35.144 --> 01:27:36.986]  But, no, you can certainly call this show.
[01:27:37.006 --> 01:27:37.466]  Wrong again.
[01:27:37.606 --> 01:27:38.287]  Wrong again.
[01:27:38.307 --> 01:27:40.449]  Just keep on keeping on until the new year.
[01:27:40.469 --> 01:27:43.232]  Well, if that was the case, why wouldn't I just... I love it.
[01:27:43.292 --> 01:27:43.572]  You know what?
[01:27:43.592 --> 01:27:48.697]  There are all the listeners out there listening who call here and know the calls aren't screened and know that you're telling a lie.
[01:27:49.304 --> 01:27:50.264]  I'm not telling a lie.
[01:27:50.324 --> 01:27:56.846]  GCN has told me I cannot call into GCN anymore because I tore you apart the last time I talked to you.
[01:27:57.266 --> 01:27:58.386]  You tore me apart?
[01:27:58.426 --> 01:27:58.826]  Repeat it.
[01:27:59.226 --> 01:28:00.607]  Please repeat the tearing apart right now.
[01:28:01.787 --> 01:28:03.307]  It was a seven-minute conversation.
[01:28:03.327 --> 01:28:04.487]  I'm not repeating the whole thing.
[01:28:04.527 --> 01:28:05.468]  I don't have it memorized.
[01:28:05.508 --> 01:28:07.048]  But, I mean, you said you're banned, sir.
[01:28:07.068 --> 01:28:08.068]  You're here on the air right now.
[01:28:08.088 --> 01:28:10.009]  That's because I used a fake name.
[01:28:10.549 --> 01:28:11.849]  No, you're on air right now, sir.
[01:28:11.889 --> 01:28:13.889]  I could have hung up on you, delayed you out.
[01:28:13.909 --> 01:28:14.890]  We have a ten-second delay.
[01:28:14.910 --> 01:28:16.390]  No one would have ever even known you were there.
[01:28:17.441 --> 01:28:19.641]  Well, maybe, maybe not.
[01:28:19.661 --> 01:28:21.522]  Well, if somebody did tell you that, that's wrong.
[01:28:21.722 --> 01:28:23.442]  And they don't, so that's strange.
[01:28:23.642 --> 01:28:24.883]  But let me just go back here.
[01:28:25.743 --> 01:28:27.863]  Are you saying Operation Northwood is the official U.S.
[01:28:27.883 --> 01:28:30.424]  government plan to carry out 9-11?
[01:28:30.644 --> 01:28:31.924]  I don't care 40 years ago.
[01:28:32.164 --> 01:28:32.964]  Do not care.
[01:28:33.304 --> 01:28:34.325]  Do not care.
[01:28:34.785 --> 01:28:35.385]  Do not care.
[01:28:35.425 --> 01:28:40.546]  Do you believe governments ever say... Do you believe governments... Do you believe that there are criminal elements in our government?
[01:28:41.726 --> 01:28:43.747]  I'm sure there's some shady characters, absolutely.
[01:28:43.927 --> 01:28:45.047]  But it has nothing to do with 9-11...
[01:28:47.153 --> 01:28:50.736]  Really, you think 19 guys commanded from a cave made NORAD stand down?
[01:28:50.756 --> 01:28:52.057]  No, they didn't do it from a cave.
[01:28:52.217 --> 01:28:53.658]  They didn't do anything from a cave.
[01:28:55.080 --> 01:28:56.721]  I thought they were commanded from a cave.
[01:28:59.043 --> 01:28:59.583]  No, they weren't.
[01:28:59.743 --> 01:29:02.886]  Do you think Building 7, not hit by an airplane, fell?
[01:29:03.466 --> 01:29:04.227]  Be disingenuous.
[01:29:04.267 --> 01:29:05.348]  Keep being disingenuous.
[01:29:05.648 --> 01:29:06.929]  Oh, it wasn't hit by a plane.
[01:29:07.210 --> 01:29:08.651]  It just had a few small fires.
[01:29:09.031 --> 01:29:09.591]  That was it.
[01:29:09.652 --> 01:29:10.252]  Nothing else.
[01:29:10.512 --> 01:29:11.553]  I know how you work.
[01:29:11.793 --> 01:29:13.274]  And keep on doing it.
[01:29:13.294 --> 01:29:15.016]  You know how I work, sir.
[01:29:15.156 --> 01:29:16.197]  That's the NIST report.
[01:29:17.947 --> 01:29:18.687]  I know you love it.
[01:29:18.707 --> 01:29:19.688]  Hey, don't worry, man.
[01:29:20.548 --> 01:29:22.789]  Keep it on to the New Year, big boy, because I love it.
[01:29:22.809 --> 01:29:24.010]  Hey, I'm going to put you on hold.
[01:29:24.030 --> 01:29:24.610]  Don't hang up.
[01:29:24.670 --> 01:29:25.551]  I want to come back to you.
[01:29:26.471 --> 01:29:27.372]  I want to come back to you.
[01:29:28.672 --> 01:29:29.273]  Hey, don't worry.
[01:29:29.293 --> 01:29:30.353]  North American Union's here.
[01:29:30.413 --> 01:29:31.374]  People are in denial about it.
[01:29:31.414 --> 01:29:31.754]  Don't worry.
[01:29:31.774 --> 01:29:36.056]  They're going to vote for illegal ailing and amnesty next year with the new Congress.
[01:29:36.596 --> 01:29:37.037]  Don't worry.
[01:29:37.077 --> 01:29:38.077]  The dollar's been destroyed.
[01:29:38.117 --> 01:29:38.978]  You can just deny it all.
[01:29:39.018 --> 01:29:40.478]  There's no world government, no corruption.
[01:29:41.659 --> 01:29:41.899]  See?
[01:29:42.679 --> 01:29:43.760]  People like him win, folks.
[01:29:43.800 --> 01:29:44.360]  He gets his way.
[01:29:44.400 --> 01:29:44.940]  America dies.
[01:29:44.960 --> 01:29:45.821]  We'll be right back.
[01:29:52.210 --> 01:29:52.770]  It's a fact.
[01:29:52.971 --> 01:29:57.394]  You can legally eliminate credit card debt, which has been fraudulently created by the banks.
[01:29:57.854 --> 01:30:03.058]  Since its creation in 1913, the Federal Reserve has not been held responsible for its own debt.
[01:30:03.339 --> 01:30:06.541]  So why should you, the hardworking American, be harassed for yours?
[01:30:06.801 --> 01:30:13.907]  There's a double standard when it comes to being responsible for debt, and unlike the Federal Reserve, the people of this country can't print more money when needed.
[01:30:14.187 --> 01:30:15.228]  It's time to turn your life around.
[01:30:34.847 --> 01:30:36.328]  Call Day of Jubilee.
[01:30:36.508 --> 01:30:37.428]  Open 9 a.m.
[01:30:37.468 --> 01:30:38.289]  to 5 p.m.
[01:30:38.349 --> 01:30:39.849]  Central Standard Time at 920-293-8024.
[01:30:39.889 --> 01:30:40.270]  That's 920-293-8024.
[01:30:40.370 --> 01:30:41.330]  And ask for Robert.
[01:30:41.390 --> 01:30:44.352]  Don't wait any longer to get your life back in order.
[01:30:52.370 --> 01:30:54.031]  Shelly, you look exhausted.
[01:30:54.091 --> 01:30:54.911]  What's wrong?
[01:30:54.931 --> 01:30:56.191]  I am so tired.
[01:30:56.251 --> 01:30:58.732]  I just get so hot at night and can't sleep.
[01:30:58.872 --> 01:30:59.952]  I have tried everything.
[01:31:00.012 --> 01:31:01.773]  All kinds of fans, sheets, pillows.
[01:31:01.913 --> 01:31:03.073]  You name it, I've tried it.
[01:31:03.193 --> 01:31:05.494]  My husband has always been a hot sleeper.
[01:31:05.654 --> 01:31:07.215]  He's never had a good night's sleep.
[01:31:07.455 --> 01:31:09.495]  Then we discovered something that really helps.
[01:31:09.615 --> 01:31:11.836]  It's called the BedFan Personal Cooling System.
[01:31:12.016 --> 01:31:12.536]  The what?
[01:31:12.796 --> 01:31:14.877]  The BedFan Personal Cooling System.
[01:31:14.997 --> 01:31:20.338]  It will keep you cool all night long and will work for everyone that sleeps hot, no matter what the reason.
[01:31:20.519 --> 01:31:21.759]  You can see it at BedFan.com

[01:31:38.737 --> 01:31:39.957]  Is your partner a hot sleeper?
[01:31:39.977 --> 01:31:43.218]  Or are you looking for the perfect gift for that person who has everything?
[01:31:43.458 --> 01:31:44.759]  The Bed Fan is the answer.
[01:31:44.979 --> 01:31:46.379]  Visit BedFan.com.
[01:31:46.639 --> 01:31:49.640]  That's BedFan.com.
[01:31:49.740 --> 01:31:52.261]  Question.
[01:31:52.811 --> 01:31:56.755]  I found this company online and they had this really unique variety of salt wellness products.
[01:31:56.995 --> 01:32:00.538]  I read some of the articles and ended up ordering this beautiful salt lamp.
[01:32:00.818 --> 01:32:04.902]  According to the company, they said that the salt crystal lamps gently purify indoor air.
[01:32:05.182 --> 01:32:06.103]  I was so amazed.
[01:32:06.363 --> 01:32:09.206]  I put it in the baby's room and it made a perfect night light.
[01:32:09.386 --> 01:32:11.248]  Both my husband and I could tell the difference.
[01:32:11.648 --> 01:32:16.871]  SoleilWellness.com is a unique company that offers salt wellness products from around the world.
[01:32:17.312 --> 01:32:23.235]  So, I went back to the site and ordered their Soleil Simple Natural Cleaning Products, also made with Himalayan salt.
[01:32:23.496 --> 01:32:25.237]  I figured it would clean really well.
[01:32:25.477 --> 01:32:28.679]  The natural cleaning products worked wonderfully and there was no scent.
[01:32:28.859 --> 01:32:32.741]  This company has so many products my whole family can enjoy and feel better with.
[01:32:33.042 --> 01:32:34.523]  Plus, the service was great.
[01:32:34.843 --> 01:32:39.486]  If you're interested in natural, homeopathic, time-tested remedies, visit SoleilWellness.com.
[01:32:40.086 --> 01:32:43.794]  That's S-O-L-A-Y Wellness dot com or call 312-224-2710.
[01:32:43.814 --> 01:32:43.854]  312-224-2710.
[01:32:54.187 --> 01:32:58.309]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass?
[01:32:58.529 --> 01:33:00.289]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[01:33:00.549 --> 01:33:06.832]  If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough, the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[01:33:07.132 --> 01:33:13.254]  Using this similar principle, Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[01:33:13.494 --> 01:33:15.355]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument
[01:33:15.475 --> 01:33:15.875]  We're good to go.
[01:33:39.293 --> 01:33:41.453]  For more information, call BioSolutions toll-free 1-866-885-6625.
[01:33:41.473 --> 01:33:41.774]  That's 1-866-885-6625.
[01:33:41.794 --> 01:33:41.874]  1-866-885-6625.
[01:33:41.894 --> 01:33:42.874]  You are listening to GCN.
[01:33:42.994 --> 01:33:43.814]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:34:01.954 --> 01:34:05.497]  The government's probably going to launch an anthrax attack half and four weeks later, of course.
[01:34:05.938 --> 01:34:08.340]  White House on Cipro, it turned out, Associated Press.
[01:34:09.441 --> 01:34:15.106]  And I'm talking to Jimmy Wright, a family friend who's a great engineer who worked in New York, also lives out in Fredericksburg half the year.
[01:34:15.647 --> 01:34:19.891]  I'm talking to him as he's right next door after it explodes, and he's saying it looks like a controlled demolition.
[01:34:20.131 --> 01:34:25.175]  I want to play a few minutes of this, but go up to YouTube and just type Alex Jones Historic Broadcast in.
[01:34:25.195 --> 01:34:27.778]  You can listen to the whole three hours on YouTube.
[01:34:28.600 --> 01:34:29.221]  Right there for free.
[01:34:29.261 --> 01:34:31.263]  And, I mean, hear me come on the air at 11 a.m.
[01:34:31.303 --> 01:34:32.444]  right after the attacks.
[01:34:32.725 --> 01:34:33.646]  It's an inside job.
[01:34:33.686 --> 01:34:35.067]  And just lay it all out.
[01:34:35.428 --> 01:34:37.129]  Say they're going to launch an anthrax attack.
[01:34:37.630 --> 01:34:39.732]  I mean, just because I know their operations.
[01:34:39.812 --> 01:34:40.793]  I know how they operate.
[01:34:41.054 --> 01:34:44.157]  Then we've got people like Troy calling in.
[01:34:44.642 --> 01:34:45.563]  No, no, and yep.
[01:34:45.583 --> 01:34:47.464]  No to your first two questions, and yep, you're a nut.
[01:34:47.504 --> 01:34:48.985]  So there's no North American Union?
[01:34:49.045 --> 01:34:50.225]  Lou Dobbs is crazy too?
[01:35:13.399 --> 01:35:15.701]  Well, I don't know him well enough to answer that.
[01:35:15.741 --> 01:35:17.462]  But, I mean, sir, they signed it last year.
[01:35:17.522 --> 01:35:18.002]  We're in it.
[01:35:18.523 --> 01:35:20.204]  We're losing our sovereignty right now.
[01:35:20.444 --> 01:35:20.904]  No, we're not.
[01:35:22.065 --> 01:35:22.786]  You are wrong.
[01:35:22.806 --> 01:35:23.886]  100% wrong.
[01:35:24.186 --> 01:35:25.527]  The caller wants to talk to you.
[01:35:25.547 --> 01:35:27.909]  Let's go to Bill in Baltimore.
[01:35:28.229 --> 01:35:30.411]  Put him on with Troy from West Virginia.
[01:35:30.451 --> 01:35:31.251]  Bill, have at him.
[01:35:31.952 --> 01:35:33.793]  Hey, Troy, is it true you're a federal agent?
[01:35:36.495 --> 01:35:36.815]  Troy.
[01:35:39.137 --> 01:35:39.357]  Well, I...
[01:35:39.992 --> 01:35:40.412]  I guess so.
[01:35:40.532 --> 01:35:41.712]  Is it true you're a federal agent?
[01:35:41.732 --> 01:35:42.613]  Troy just hung up.
[01:35:42.913 --> 01:35:45.233]  That's Troy hung up.
[01:35:45.273 --> 01:35:46.433]  Bill, finish up what you want to say.
[01:35:46.713 --> 01:35:47.754]  I think he's a federal agent.
[01:35:47.794 --> 01:35:49.994]  No human being could possibly be that retarded.
[01:35:52.555 --> 01:35:59.076]  Well, I mean, if he is a federal agent, which he probably isn't, people cannot believe this stuff.
[01:35:59.116 --> 01:36:00.636]  It's too painful to their paradigm.
[01:36:00.816 --> 01:36:07.498]  Yeah, but some people will believe on some level the government's incompetent, and if you try to reason with them, you know, why is this?
[01:36:08.413 --> 01:36:10.236]  Terrible stuff happening on a regular basis.
[01:36:10.256 --> 01:36:13.400]  Well, certain levels of the government are incompetent, and it's designed that way.
[01:36:13.661 --> 01:36:18.688]  But this is a government that can shoot a cruise missile through an open window from a thousand miles away.
[01:36:18.768 --> 01:36:20.531]  So they're not completely incompetent.
[01:36:20.811 --> 01:36:23.736]  And they've got a naval base right next to the Pentagon.
[01:36:24.850 --> 01:36:27.252]  Look, they had missile launchers on top of it.
[01:36:27.272 --> 01:36:33.658]  We have Norman Mineta, Transportation Secretary, saying that the plane's 50 miles out, 20 miles out, 10 miles out.
[01:36:33.918 --> 01:36:34.899]  Does the order still stand?
[01:36:35.119 --> 01:36:39.143]  Two months before 9-11, Dick Cheney took the shoot-down powers away from the generals.
[01:36:39.663 --> 01:36:44.127]  Okay, I'm going to take a few final calls here at the end, but before we do that, I want to play this clip.
[01:36:45.629 --> 01:36:46.950]  This is a clip of
[01:36:47.964 --> 01:36:54.986]  Myself, 12 minutes into my radio show on 9-11, I'd already gotten a New York source, a family friend, Jimmy Wright.
[01:36:55.386 --> 01:36:58.727]  He lives out in Fredericksburg, but he works half the year at the World Financial Center then.
[01:36:59.047 --> 01:37:00.247]  He's an international banker.
[01:37:00.767 --> 01:37:02.428]  He does international banking.
[01:37:02.488 --> 01:37:03.628]  I mean, huge deals.
[01:37:03.688 --> 01:37:04.828]  Airport deals.
[01:37:05.188 --> 01:37:07.029]  Nice, upstanding, upper-middle-class guy.
[01:37:07.329 --> 01:37:09.569]  Friends of the family through the Boots family.
[01:37:09.929 --> 01:37:12.250]  And we could go out there and vacation at their ranch and hang out with them.
[01:37:12.270 --> 01:37:13.830]  I don't know why I'm giving you that background info.
[01:37:14.130 --> 01:37:15.031]  I got him on the line.
[01:37:15.071 --> 01:37:15.991]  He worked right next door.
[01:37:16.522 --> 01:37:18.404]  Suddenly, at One World Trade Center, you could hear the shock.
[01:37:39.364 --> 01:37:46.908]  It looked like an explosion or things blowing out from around the 70th or 80th floor all the way around the building.
[01:37:48.329 --> 01:37:51.370]  And the building just dropped straight down.
[01:37:51.390 --> 01:37:54.772]  The building was literally gone within five seconds.
[01:37:55.432 --> 01:37:59.594]  I mean, Alex, I used to be a structural engineer and I've watched buildings implode.
[01:37:59.674 --> 01:38:03.136]  It was the most perfect implosion I've ever seen in my life.
[01:38:03.951 --> 01:38:07.275]  It came straight down in one monolithic piece.
[01:38:07.415 --> 01:38:08.857]  Now, you were a structural engineer.
[01:38:08.917 --> 01:38:15.345]  How could fire in the upper floors... You say one plane hit about the 100th floor, the other hit about the 75th floor.
[01:38:15.745 --> 01:38:18.929]  How does that cause a building to completely collapse?
[01:38:19.109 --> 01:38:20.351]  I don't believe it does, Alex.
[01:38:20.451 --> 01:38:23.014]  I mean, looking at the way the building came down...
[01:38:24.210 --> 01:38:31.198]  It looked like there was charges up around the 70th, but I've just got to believe there was also charges at the base of the building.
[01:38:31.338 --> 01:38:35.923]  Okay, so... And to bring something down that fast, I mean, one of two things have to happen.
[01:38:36.844 --> 01:38:41.029]  The charges have to be so perfectly placed, I mean, engineered...
[01:38:41.986 --> 01:38:46.329]  Or there has to be so much there that it just obliterates everything.
[01:38:46.369 --> 01:38:50.211]  Jim Wright, this is like a bad nightmare.
[01:38:50.631 --> 01:38:52.112]  I know you're familiar with what I do.
[01:38:52.232 --> 01:38:58.436]  I have produced a film showing the feds removing unexploded bombs from the columns at the Oklahoma City building that was blown out.
[01:38:58.796 --> 01:38:59.857]  Obviously not blown in.
[01:39:00.177 --> 01:39:01.478]  This is government.
[01:39:01.518 --> 01:39:04.880]  What you have just told us, sir, I saw those buildings collapse.
[01:39:05.180 --> 01:39:06.100]  You were right there.
[01:39:06.180 --> 01:39:07.641]  I was watching it on the news.
[01:39:07.961 --> 01:39:09.542]  They wanted massive death.
[01:39:09.943 --> 01:39:10.623]  So you're saying...
[01:39:11.183 --> 01:39:11.603]  That's good.
[01:39:11.623 --> 01:39:13.484]  I meant to air more of it, but the lines are loaded.
[01:39:13.504 --> 01:39:18.006]  Let me just run through here, end of the year, last four minutes, last five minutes.
[01:39:18.046 --> 01:39:20.107]  Let's just run through a bunch of your calls quickly.
[01:39:20.547 --> 01:39:22.027]  Let's talk to Chris in West Virginia.
[01:39:22.067 --> 01:39:22.668]  You're on the air.
[01:39:22.688 --> 01:39:23.248]  Thanks for holding.
[01:39:23.268 --> 01:39:23.548]  Go ahead.
[01:39:23.568 --> 01:39:24.568]  How are you doing, Alex?
[01:39:24.588 --> 01:39:24.828]  Good.
[01:39:25.409 --> 01:39:25.649]  Good.
[01:39:25.669 --> 01:39:31.071]  That guy Troy seems to give people from West Virginia a bad name.
[01:39:32.414 --> 01:39:34.115]  Well, he sent us emails.
[01:39:34.155 --> 01:39:36.176]  He's really in Florida, probably at CENTCOM.
[01:39:36.416 --> 01:39:36.916]  But go ahead.
[01:39:37.077 --> 01:39:38.037]  Yeah, it's possible.
[01:39:38.057 --> 01:39:44.560]  By the way, CENTCOM admits they have thousands of people online, quote, fighting propaganda on radio and the Internet.
[01:39:44.580 --> 01:39:47.182]  So when I say probably with CENTCOM, I'm not joking.
[01:39:48.302 --> 01:39:48.962]  Probably right.
[01:39:49.042 --> 01:39:51.164]  But it's just the Pentagon engaged in domestic propaganda.
[01:39:51.364 --> 01:39:51.704]  So what?
[01:39:51.724 --> 01:39:52.244]  That's freedom.
[01:39:52.584 --> 01:39:55.005]  It's like, you know, the military's going to be foreign troops now.
[01:39:55.806 --> 01:39:55.986]  Yeah.
[01:39:56.953 --> 01:39:57.994]  A couple things.
[01:39:58.034 --> 01:39:59.315]  Well, there's one thing I wanted to ask you.
[01:40:01.476 --> 01:40:04.478]  Several years ago, I'm originally from Massachusetts.
[01:40:04.518 --> 01:40:05.239]  I moved down here.
[01:40:05.659 --> 01:40:06.319]  Got to make it quick.
[01:40:06.520 --> 01:40:10.082]  Okay, the Libertarian Party was very active, very active on the issues.
[01:40:10.542 --> 01:40:12.844]  A lot of new faces, a lot of new candidates.
[01:40:13.524 --> 01:40:17.827]  And, you know, I was a registered Libertarian in Massachusetts, and it just seems like
[01:40:18.484 --> 01:40:23.949]  In the last several years, even if you go to their website, they don't address any of the issues.
[01:40:24.009 --> 01:40:24.530]  No, they don't.
[01:40:24.570 --> 01:40:33.898]  The Libertarian Party's got a lot of good people in it, but overall it's compromised, it's whitewashed, and it's sad.
[01:40:33.938 --> 01:40:37.702]  I mean, it's way, way too moderate and needs to get a lot more hardcore.
[01:40:38.182 --> 01:40:39.804]  Let's talk to Nancy in North Austin.
[01:40:39.824 --> 01:40:40.304]  You're on the air.
[01:40:40.344 --> 01:40:40.704]  Go ahead.
[01:40:40.724 --> 01:40:41.745]  Hi, Alex.
[01:40:41.826 --> 01:40:42.626]  How are you doing today?
[01:40:42.666 --> 01:40:43.187]  Fine, thank you.
[01:40:43.207 --> 01:40:44.148]  Have a good New Year.
[01:40:44.168 --> 01:40:44.408]  Go ahead.
[01:40:44.861 --> 01:40:45.121]  Thanks.
[01:40:45.281 --> 01:40:47.143]  I just was watching Loose Change.
[01:40:47.163 --> 01:40:49.345]  It was a documentary on Google.com.
[01:40:49.385 --> 01:40:53.569]  And one of the things that they alleged was that Flight 93 actually landed in Cleveland.
[01:40:54.344 --> 01:40:55.484]  Well, they bring that up.
[01:40:55.564 --> 01:40:58.445]  And again, I don't know if you're watching one or two.
[01:40:58.525 --> 01:41:00.025]  I suggest you go watch Terror Storm.
[01:41:00.065 --> 01:41:01.005]  Loose Change is great, too.
[01:41:01.365 --> 01:41:03.386]  Go watch Terror Storm.
[01:41:03.546 --> 01:41:05.066]  Google Terror Storm.
[01:41:05.106 --> 01:41:10.387]  You can also buy it in stores all over the country or Amazon.com or Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:41:10.567 --> 01:41:11.528]  But go watch Terror Storm.
[01:41:11.548 --> 01:41:13.908]  We show all the admissions where the U.S.
[01:41:13.948 --> 01:41:17.589]  government admits that they have staged terror attacks in the past.
[01:41:17.809 --> 01:41:20.309]  This is declassified stuff in Terror Storm.
[01:41:21.410 --> 01:41:21.690]  Okay.
[01:41:22.270 --> 01:41:22.690]  Anything else?
[01:41:23.450 --> 01:41:25.531]  No, I just want to say you're great, and I enjoy listening to you.
[01:41:25.811 --> 01:41:27.052]  Thank you, and I'm sorry we're out of time.
[01:41:27.092 --> 01:41:29.953]  Call me back next week, and we'll have more time, I promise.
[01:41:30.654 --> 01:41:36.877]  Let's go ahead and talk to Phil, and he's calling in Hyde Park also from Austin, obviously a KLBJ 590 listener.
[01:41:37.157 --> 01:41:37.758]  Go ahead, Phil.
[01:41:38.518 --> 01:41:41.660]  Alex, I do a daily show called BigRamble.com.
[01:41:42.080 --> 01:41:44.061]  What else can we do to help you get the message out next year?
[01:41:45.034 --> 01:41:47.496]  Well, I'm just helping with the message out of liberty and freedom.
[01:41:47.536 --> 01:41:48.157]  It's not helping me.
[01:41:48.217 --> 01:41:49.017]  It's helping everybody.
[01:41:49.257 --> 01:41:49.838]  What can we do?
[01:41:49.998 --> 01:41:54.922]  Tell your whole email list, your blog, about InfoWars.com, about the radio shows I do.
[01:41:55.182 --> 01:41:57.584]  Tell them to go to Google Video, watch Terror Storm for free.
[01:41:57.924 --> 01:41:59.906]  Pass the link on to everybody you know.
[01:42:00.687 --> 01:42:02.408]  Get a copy of Terror Storm on DVD.
[01:42:02.448 --> 01:42:02.968]  Make copies.
[01:42:02.988 --> 01:42:03.569]  Get it out to people.
[01:42:04.079 --> 01:42:04.880]  All right, I'm promoting you.
[01:42:04.900 --> 01:42:07.201]  Tell everybody else out there listening, I'll let you get the next call.
[01:42:07.221 --> 01:42:07.761]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:42:07.881 --> 01:42:08.281]  Thank you.
[01:42:08.321 --> 01:42:09.042]  Good to hear from you.
[01:42:09.342 --> 01:42:13.304]  Let's go ahead and talk to Mike in California.
[01:42:13.845 --> 01:42:16.226]  Mike, you are on the air, sir.
[01:42:16.366 --> 01:42:16.746]  Welcome.
[01:42:18.787 --> 01:42:19.228]  Go ahead.
[01:42:19.988 --> 01:42:20.768]  Hi, Alex.
[01:42:20.868 --> 01:42:22.149]  My name is Carla.
[01:42:22.169 --> 01:42:23.530]  I don't know if you're still on the air or not.
[01:42:23.610 --> 01:42:24.971]  Okay, I guess I went to the wrong line.
[01:42:25.011 --> 01:42:25.371]  Go ahead.
[01:42:26.311 --> 01:42:28.953]  Anyways, I am calling about the religious referrals.
[01:42:29.731 --> 01:42:39.179]  In the Austin American Statement, and you know how all of the churches have got their addresses and so forth, the only one that doesn't is AEIOU Akbar.
[01:42:39.539 --> 01:42:41.180]  It's listed under Islam.
[01:42:41.301 --> 01:42:46.185]  And if you were just to pick it up, to look at it, you would think that they're sending messages.
[01:42:46.525 --> 01:42:47.986]  But there's no address.
[01:42:48.186 --> 01:42:48.847]  There's nothing.
[01:42:48.887 --> 01:42:51.129]  There's just a weekly message.
[01:42:51.569 --> 01:42:52.550]  Well, let me be clear.
[01:42:52.590 --> 01:42:54.131]  I don't know about that particular thing you mentioned.
[01:42:54.151 --> 01:42:55.012]  It's probably nothing.
[01:42:55.372 --> 01:42:56.993]  It's yesterday's newspaper.
[01:42:57.574 --> 01:42:59.135]  Look in yesterday's Austin American Statement.
[01:43:00.098 --> 01:43:02.099]  But I was going to tell you, George Bush, Sr.
[01:43:02.139 --> 01:43:09.904]  brought in 3,500-plus Iraqi Republican Guard trained at the School of the Americas by the CIA and other bases in the 1980s.
[01:43:10.084 --> 01:43:13.066]  They brought them in after the Gulf War in 1991-92.
[01:43:13.367 --> 01:43:17.169]  Clinton brought in another 2,000 in 1993.
[01:43:17.529 --> 01:43:18.390]  There are U.S.
[01:43:18.430 --> 01:43:23.613]  government terror networks that happen to be Arabic, but they really work for the U.S.
[01:43:23.653 --> 01:43:23.973]  government.
[01:43:24.173 --> 01:43:24.834]  They're everywhere.
[01:43:24.854 --> 01:43:27.976]  The globalists can give one order, and they will attack every U.S.
[01:43:27.996 --> 01:43:28.256]  city.
[01:43:29.109 --> 01:43:33.832]  By the way, Congressman Anna Rohrabacher on CNN three days ago brought up government cover-up of Oklahoma City.
[01:43:34.152 --> 01:43:36.073]  So there's another conspiracy now public.
[01:43:36.393 --> 01:43:39.815]  Paul in Cleveland, you're on the air, sir.
[01:43:40.795 --> 01:43:41.235]  Welcome.
[01:43:41.896 --> 01:43:45.557]  Well, it says Line 6, but then Line 6 is another name.
[01:43:45.577 --> 01:43:46.598]  I don't know what's going on here.
[01:43:47.258 --> 01:43:48.299]  I'll just take these two final calls.
[01:43:48.319 --> 01:43:49.099]  Whoever's there is there.
[01:43:49.179 --> 01:43:49.299]  Hello?
[01:43:49.319 --> 01:43:50.400]  Go ahead and call her.
[01:43:50.440 --> 01:43:51.140]  You're on the air.
[01:43:51.621 --> 01:43:51.901]  Alex?
[01:43:52.061 --> 01:43:52.321]  Yes.
[01:43:52.721 --> 01:43:54.362]  Hi, I'm Mike from California.
[01:43:54.784 --> 01:43:55.404]  Welcome, sir.
[01:43:55.805 --> 01:43:57.146]  Sorry that Paul accidentally hung up on him.
[01:43:57.166 --> 01:43:57.906]  Go ahead.
[01:43:57.986 --> 01:43:59.227]  Happy New Year's to you.
[01:43:59.667 --> 01:44:00.167]  Go ahead, sir.
[01:44:00.207 --> 01:44:00.488]  Thank you.
[01:44:00.568 --> 01:44:04.310]  And I just want to say, hey, you know, I'm a big fan of yours.
[01:44:04.770 --> 01:44:16.778]  I subscribe to PrisonPlanet.tv, and I just want to help you wake people up, and I just want everybody out there that's listening to you to know that they've got to wake up, and they've got to wake up now and stop being sheeple.
[01:44:17.778 --> 01:44:18.439]  Absolutely.
[01:44:18.559 --> 01:44:19.339]  I'm out of time.
[01:44:20.760 --> 01:44:22.281]  I'll be back next Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.,
[01:44:24.127 --> 01:44:27.709]  Be sure to tune in over the web or any of the fine stations to pick up the transmission.
[01:44:27.729 --> 01:44:30.770]  Of course, also the weekday show, 11 to 2 Central.
[01:44:33.272 --> 01:44:35.033]  And I hope you will go Google Terror Storm.
[01:44:35.453 --> 01:44:40.796]  Make the New Year's resolution to watch Terror Storm at Google Video for free in the New Year or get it from Amazon.com.
[01:44:40.996 --> 01:44:41.676]  It's Terror Storm.
[01:44:41.996 --> 01:44:42.336]  Bye.
