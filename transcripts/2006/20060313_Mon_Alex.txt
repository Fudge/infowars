[00:00:05.917 --> 00:00:06.578]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:08.362]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:09.004 --> 00:00:10.126]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.787 --> 00:00:11.569]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.351 --> 00:00:13.132]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.552]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.072 --> 00:00:22.195]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:50.104]  In the next month or so, the secret Bilderberg group meeting will be held somewhere in Europe or in the United States, sometimes in Canada.
[00:00:51.145 --> 00:00:57.668]  And we're going to be talking to Jim Tucker of American Free Press coming up in the second hour today.
[00:00:57.688 --> 00:01:01.090]  We'll be talking about the First Amendment under attack in the third hour.
[00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:07.613]  Evangelists to stand trial for ministering on public sidewalk federal lawsuit.
[00:01:08.653 --> 00:01:10.715]  And it's Repent America again.
[00:01:10.775 --> 00:01:15.859]  Remember about two years ago they were in Philadelphia praying on a city sidewalk.
[00:01:15.919 --> 00:01:17.800]  Thank God they shot video of all of it.
[00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.963]  Weren't even saying anything insulting to the outfest that was going on.
[00:01:22.604 --> 00:01:23.304]  Just praying.
[00:01:23.585 --> 00:01:29.609]  And so some of the other activists on the other side came over and started yelling and screaming at them and threatening them.
[00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:34.513]  And the police said because they prayed it made the other people threaten them.
[00:01:35.243 --> 00:01:42.748]  And so that made them terrorists, so they were arrested and they faced 47 years in prison of peace.
[00:01:42.888 --> 00:01:47.631]  And it was in big Philadelphia newspapers, national newspapers, as if it was normal.
[00:01:48.112 --> 00:01:51.594]  Oh yes, they needed to spend a lot of time in prison.
[00:01:51.614 --> 00:01:55.337]  This America is like China now.
[00:01:55.357 --> 00:02:00.220]  So Mr. Markavage will be joining us in the third hour today.
[00:02:01.747 --> 00:02:09.050]  Massive news coming up, of course, in the second hour on the hunt for the secret global meeting that is now on.
[00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:13.391]  And that will be with Jim Tucker.
[00:02:14.912 --> 00:02:21.114]  They've now recast the War on Terror, the global war against extremism.
[00:02:21.154 --> 00:02:22.434]  They have many different names for it.
[00:02:23.074 --> 00:02:27.456]  Now the new name is the Long War, the Endless War, the Unending War.
[00:02:27.516 --> 00:02:30.517]  We'll play a little clip from the Colbert Report
[00:02:31.685 --> 00:02:34.488]  On that situation coming up.
[00:02:34.828 --> 00:02:39.692]  And, of course, the big news, Milajevic's blood had drug traces.
[00:02:39.772 --> 00:02:41.654]  He said, they're going to kill me with poison.
[00:02:42.315 --> 00:02:43.536]  They've done the autopsy.
[00:02:43.596 --> 00:02:45.257]  The poison is there.
[00:02:45.277 --> 00:02:48.740]  And they clearly murdered him.
[00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:57.268]  And what no one's really paying attention to is the fact that one of his former deputies, who was a big witness against him,
[00:02:58.081 --> 00:03:03.005]  But the news has been reporting he wasn't doing quite the job the globalists had ordered him to.
[00:03:03.025 --> 00:03:05.347]  Oh, he died the same week.
[00:03:05.367 --> 00:03:08.790]  There's only a few prisoners in this Hague jail.
[00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:11.612]  But he died too.
[00:03:11.852 --> 00:03:13.914]  Oh, but he committed suicide.
[00:03:14.134 --> 00:03:14.494]  Sure.
[00:03:15.115 --> 00:03:19.738]  And Slobodan Milajevic said three days after he died, he said, They killed him.
[00:03:20.018 --> 00:03:21.119]  They're going to kill me.
[00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:24.322]  I'm catching them, put some type of white powder in my food.
[00:03:25.365 --> 00:03:29.506]  And he said, help me, they're going to murder me, and they killed him.
[00:03:30.966 --> 00:03:32.907]  And we'll go over why they did that.
[00:03:32.947 --> 00:03:36.668]  Paul Watson's done an interesting article on that subject.
[00:03:36.688 --> 00:03:45.370]  But one of his deputies who had testified against him, he conveniently has died now.
[00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:48.731]  I'm sure he was told he'd be freed, everything would be okay.
[00:03:49.611 --> 00:03:53.792]  You gotta love it when the UN's got their own prisoners who they arrest and say they're war criminals.
[00:03:53.812 --> 00:04:01.175]  They're in the same jail with them and then suddenly, you know, they get promised some goodies and, okay, I'll go lie against Slobo and then, oh, you're dead too.
[00:04:01.855 --> 00:04:03.395]  So why Milajevic was murdered?
[00:04:03.975 --> 00:04:07.196]  Ten Pot Dictator blew the whistle on the New World Order.
[00:04:08.537 --> 00:04:10.337]  Milajevic found dead in his cell.
[00:04:11.038 --> 00:04:15.679]  And, of course, one of his deputies found dead as well just a few days before and he said, they're gonna kill me!
[00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:18.740]  And then the Associated Press reports that
[00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:27.806]  The coroner's report admits he had the poison in his blood, but oh, Slobo probably did it to make everyone feel sorry for him.
[00:04:28.066 --> 00:04:29.727]  He smuggled the poison in himself.
[00:04:30.207 --> 00:04:30.868]  He did it.
[00:04:32.609 --> 00:04:34.870]  A former White House advisor arrested.
[00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:36.631]  I'm sure Al Qaeda caused that, too.
[00:04:37.912 --> 00:04:40.334]  Arrested stealing, allegedly.
[00:04:40.354 --> 00:04:43.836]  Oh, and Bush is shocked by it, he says.
[00:04:44.236 --> 00:04:45.277]  I'm sure that's not true.
[00:04:45.317 --> 00:04:46.478]  I'm sure it's Al Qaeda.
[00:04:47.486 --> 00:04:48.447]  Al-Qaeda did it.
[00:04:48.508 --> 00:04:48.808]  Yes.
[00:04:49.209 --> 00:04:49.529]  Yes.
[00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:51.111]  Everything's Al-Qaeda.
[00:04:52.413 --> 00:04:55.577]  And a lot of other really important news today.
[00:04:55.617 --> 00:04:56.679]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:00.724]  Websites are Infowars.com, Infowars.net, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:05:02.415 --> 00:05:09.798]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[00:05:10.058 --> 00:05:14.800]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:20.662]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[00:05:20.922 --> 00:05:25.443]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[00:05:25.663 --> 00:05:32.806]  The cashless society control grid, infallible microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[00:05:32.826 --> 00:05:37.367]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[00:05:37.527 --> 00:05:40.048]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masses of terror.
[00:05:40.268 --> 00:05:46.970]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.
[00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:52.478]  Order online now at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling 1-888-253-3139.
[00:05:52.498 --> 00:05:52.919]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:06:01.579 --> 00:06:04.841]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[00:06:04.901 --> 00:06:09.085]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[00:06:09.325 --> 00:06:12.107]  But if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[00:06:12.307 --> 00:06:14.709]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[00:06:14.909 --> 00:06:23.515]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 psi, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[00:06:23.735 --> 00:06:25.076]  The Brookie Light is different.
[00:06:25.276 --> 00:06:31.481]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path of the self-sterilizing filters.
[00:06:31.742 --> 00:06:43.671]  This allows the proprietary media formulation to remove and reduce pathogenic bacteria, cysts, chemicals, herbicides, pesticides, organic solvents, foul tastes, odors, heavy metals, and nitrates.
[00:06:43.891 --> 00:06:48.575]  It is so powerful, it purifies raw, untreated water from remote lakes,
[00:06:48.795 --> 00:06:49.856]  We're good to go.
[00:06:49.876 --> 00:06:50.717]  We're good to go.
[00:07:15.518 --> 00:07:20.141]  With specialized personal training, you too will be able to make big money in the world's largest market.
[00:07:20.481 --> 00:07:25.624]  If you're searching for an alternative to more traditional home-based business opportunities, then Forex trading is for you.
[00:07:26.204 --> 00:07:34.229]  The $2 trillion a day Forex currency exchange market offers exciting opportunities in volatile times when other markets are unstable and insecure.
[00:07:34.769 --> 00:07:42.454]  This powerful Forex training program will teach you how risk can be managed very advantageously to minimize the downside while still maximizing the upside potential.

[00:07:52.407 --> 00:07:52.607]  That's 503-313-9210.
[00:08:02.808 --> 00:08:08.834]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:09.435 --> 00:08:12.478]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:12.498 --> 00:08:16.082]  All right, two big guests lined up for you today.
[00:08:16.122 --> 00:08:23.169]  We're going to get into the clear murder of Solomon Milajevic and the admitted poisoning that he underwent.
[00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:24.731]  Wonder why.
[00:08:25.399 --> 00:08:30.902]  Well, because he was testifying on his own behalf and exposing how Al-Qaeda works for the U.S.
[00:08:30.942 --> 00:08:32.663]  government and was attacking his country.
[00:08:33.304 --> 00:08:36.566]  And that was in a Republican report by the Senate in 1999.
[00:08:36.946 --> 00:08:40.568]  Again, Al-Qaeda always working for its father.
[00:08:41.748 --> 00:08:50.910]  It sprung from the loins of the NWO and is a dutiful hound when it comes to running down sovereign nations.
[00:08:51.390 --> 00:08:52.130]  So we'll get into that.
[00:08:52.190 --> 00:08:54.591]  Also, former White House advisor arrested.
[00:08:55.031 --> 00:08:59.032]  Number two, at Homeland Security, stealing.
[00:09:00.032 --> 00:09:00.992]  No!
[00:09:01.652 --> 00:09:03.693]  Allegedly stealing.
[00:09:03.713 --> 00:09:05.613]  They don't steal.
[00:09:05.653 --> 00:09:07.033]  They're good Christians.
[00:09:09.094 --> 00:09:09.154]  Uh...
[00:09:10.217 --> 00:09:13.220]  Booking First and Fourth Amendment Fifth Columnist.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:24.089]  And report here, some of the new legislation they're trying to pass, that if you report on any type of surveillance, you go to prison and get a million dollar fine.
[00:09:24.109 --> 00:09:27.672]  Feingold is calling for President Bush's censure.
[00:09:29.238 --> 00:09:30.379]  We don't have a problem with this.
[00:09:30.399 --> 00:09:35.421]  They're doing it because their constituents are demanding that the police state be resisted.
[00:09:35.461 --> 00:09:36.241]  It's like Al Gore.
[00:09:36.261 --> 00:09:44.765]  I've got an article here where Al Gore is running around saying, we're turning into a dictatorship, a police state, we're in great danger.
[00:09:45.206 --> 00:09:50.728]  The problem is that he was part and parcel of setting that up with Bill Clinton, just like George Bush Sr.
[00:09:50.768 --> 00:09:51.249]  before him.
[00:09:51.289 --> 00:09:52.189]  They're just puppets.
[00:09:52.649 --> 00:09:55.991]  He's doing that to pacify the constituency.
[00:09:56.511 --> 00:09:58.872]  Democrats need to learn about their leadership.
[00:09:58.952 --> 00:10:04.876]  It's in bed with the same people that pull the strings on the marionette known as George W. Bush.
[00:10:06.197 --> 00:10:08.578]  So we'll get into Feingold calling for censure of Bush.
[00:10:09.318 --> 00:10:11.319]  A really scary article here out of Newsday.
[00:10:11.399 --> 00:10:13.681]  Big brother firms keep eye on workers.
[00:10:13.701 --> 00:10:21.185]  And the reason this is important is that in the wider context, our everyday lives will be like this, not just when we're in the office.
[00:10:21.932 --> 00:10:30.542]  And Dovetails with another article here out of the San Diego Tribune, Union Tribune, implant ID chips called Big Brother Advance.
[00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:32.901]  So we'll cover that.
[00:10:32.941 --> 00:10:35.583]  And Karl Rove vows forever war.
[00:10:35.683 --> 00:10:38.144]  Death squads operate from inside Iraq.
[00:10:38.184 --> 00:10:39.565]  Government officials admit.
[00:10:40.086 --> 00:10:43.588]  Anti-Castro sign at ballgame causes stir.
[00:10:43.628 --> 00:10:45.109]  And I've got to commend the Puerto Ricans.
[00:10:45.969 --> 00:10:53.234]  When one of the ministers of sports for Cuba ran over and got in the face of the individual holding up the sign, the police took him into custody.
[00:10:53.254 --> 00:10:55.656]  And then the police chief lectured him and said, listen,
[00:10:56.794 --> 00:11:01.077]  This is a free protectorate, part of a free country, supposedly.
[00:11:01.517 --> 00:11:03.358]  And we have free speech.
[00:11:04.158 --> 00:11:11.262]  And that will go into the discussion we're having in the third hour about where is free speech going in the United States and its possessions.
[00:11:11.302 --> 00:11:17.205]  But they explained to him that you don't get to go put the individual in prison that has a sign saying, down with Fidel.
[00:11:18.206 --> 00:11:19.807]  Just shows their mindset.
[00:11:20.127 --> 00:11:22.448]  They're in Cuba for those out there that like to defend Cuba.
[00:11:23.507 --> 00:11:28.729]  Bush jokes about Cheney controlling government at a roasting of Cheney.
[00:11:29.370 --> 00:11:34.992]  And then he goes on to make two sick jokes about shooting Mr. Whittington in the face.
[00:11:36.153 --> 00:11:42.396]  Really disgusting jokes that I think are out of control, especially in the fact that Cheney covered up what really happened.
[00:11:43.456 --> 00:11:44.837]  It's a blasé humor.
[00:11:46.261 --> 00:11:57.350]  And it just went on and on, so I'll try to spend some time just showing the let them eat cake, fiddling while Rome burned attitude that is being engaged in.
[00:11:57.370 --> 00:12:04.235]  But before I get into all of that, let's get into someone, Milajevic, who was clearly murdered.
[00:12:05.376 --> 00:12:15.844]  Back in the early 1990s, ITN admittedly produced fake video of a food storage pantry, a cinder block aid building,
[00:12:17.975 --> 00:12:30.801]  Part of a UN building that had food, and it showed about 50 people, you've all seen the footage on the cover of Time Magazine, it's still a shot of the video, up against the barbed wire, begging for food.
[00:12:31.545 --> 00:12:39.235]  But our media, starting with ITN over in England, said that these were concentration camp victims behind barbed wire begging for food.
[00:12:39.275 --> 00:12:41.938]  It turned out it was an MI6 propaganda piece.
[00:12:42.459 --> 00:12:47.965]  Much like Saddam throwing babies out of incubators was admitted, paid for, Pentagon PR.
[00:12:48.346 --> 00:12:49.147]  That's not admitted.
[00:12:49.167 --> 00:12:50.008]  It's just a total lie.
[00:12:52.540 --> 00:12:52.960]  We're good to go.
[00:12:53.001 --> 00:12:53.161]  I think?
[00:13:12.714 --> 00:13:13.955]  Okay, I know all sides.
[00:13:14.015 --> 00:13:15.016]  It's tribal warfare.
[00:13:15.036 --> 00:13:16.256]  They're slaughtering each other.
[00:13:16.657 --> 00:13:35.669]  It's been going on for 1,600 years since the Arabs invaded under the Prophet Muhammad's direction after his death and then the Crusades with the Europeans invading and the Knights Templars and Richard of Lionheart and all of them.
[00:13:35.689 --> 00:13:39.331]  Okay, this has been going on for thousands of years.
[00:13:40.026 --> 00:13:51.471]  I'm not picking sides, but the official government admissions by NATO and the UN are that roughly, from the start of the conflict in the early 90s until now, roughly triple.
[00:13:52.272 --> 00:13:53.332]  It's right under triple.
[00:13:54.773 --> 00:14:00.675]  The number of Serbs have been killed, and they've lost about half of their land, their admitted ancestral land.
[00:14:02.529 --> 00:14:02.869]  Please.
[00:14:03.349 --> 00:14:04.410]  I'm not picking sides.
[00:14:04.450 --> 00:14:08.452]  I don't want the death threats that I get whenever I mention this subject from Croats.
[00:14:09.012 --> 00:14:13.014]  I know you don't like hearing that you worked with the Nazis in World War II and the Serbs fought with America.
[00:14:13.874 --> 00:14:20.818]  I know the Muslims don't like hearing that they don't get to have a jihad, CIA-funded, admittedly, and to take over that whole region.
[00:14:20.958 --> 00:14:23.819]  I understand, but I'm just stating the facts here.
[00:14:24.651 --> 00:14:26.352]  Alright, I'm just stating the facts.
[00:14:26.412 --> 00:14:28.014]  And the Muslims haven't death-threatened me.
[00:14:28.054 --> 00:14:29.955]  I have gotten croat death-threats before.
[00:14:30.475 --> 00:14:32.197]  Pretty mean ones.
[00:14:32.217 --> 00:14:34.378]  I'm just covering the facts here.
[00:14:34.418 --> 00:14:36.480]  That's all I do.
[00:14:38.621 --> 00:14:41.023]  And it's time for you guys to stop being in each other's throats.
[00:14:42.284 --> 00:14:48.228]  But, uh... So, Slobodan Milajevic did a lot of bad things.
[00:14:48.468 --> 00:14:50.990]  But most of what you hear is a lie.
[00:14:51.070 --> 00:14:53.592]  Most of the official stories you hear is a fraud.
[00:14:54.250 --> 00:14:58.714]  Al-Qaeda, led by the super CIA officer, Osama bin Laden.
[00:14:58.754 --> 00:14:59.575]  This is a Senate report.
[00:14:59.595 --> 00:15:04.679]  That's why Alphonse D'Amato, he thought he was doing his job, and he rode him out of there real fast and he put this report out.
[00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:10.644]  Al-Qaeda, starting in 1997, began rocket attacks, attacks on schools.
[00:15:11.004 --> 00:15:13.246]  The good old CIA favorite of blowing up school buses.
[00:15:14.227 --> 00:15:18.551]  And then when Slobo ordered troops into the south, into Kosovo,
[00:15:19.948 --> 00:15:23.511]  They went down there and they said, we want the Muslims to stay.
[00:15:23.551 --> 00:15:24.391]  You're welcome to stay.
[00:15:24.751 --> 00:15:25.372]  Live in peace.
[00:15:25.452 --> 00:15:32.657]  We're just going to kick out the paramilitary forces, the KLA, which was openly CIA-funded.
[00:15:33.257 --> 00:15:34.558]  They're just breaking up the country.
[00:15:35.519 --> 00:15:44.204]  And I'll never forget, Hillary Clinton went down there as vice president, as co-president, basically, and she stood there and it showed barbed wire.
[00:15:44.244 --> 00:15:45.145]  Again, the same trick.
[00:15:46.016 --> 00:15:46.896]  And the late 90s.
[00:15:47.176 --> 00:15:51.438]  Showed the barbed wire, and she stood and said, look, it looks like Nazi Germany, a concentration camp.
[00:15:51.758 --> 00:15:52.938]  They just said, looks like.
[00:15:53.399 --> 00:16:03.002]  Now, of course, that was the Albanian barbed wire, and they weren't letting the Serbs, the Serb Muslims, get out of the country.
[00:16:03.402 --> 00:16:05.523]  And the Slobodan Milojevic said, come on, come on back in.
[00:16:05.563 --> 00:16:06.463]  We don't want you to leave.
[00:16:06.503 --> 00:16:11.125]  And so F-16 fighter bombers, we've interviewed the captain who reported on it, Spanish captain,
[00:16:12.515 --> 00:16:14.535]  It was also when one of the squadrons refused a bomb.
[00:16:14.575 --> 00:16:16.256]  They knew it was huge refugee columns.
[00:16:16.556 --> 00:16:17.656]  They ordered to destroy it.
[00:16:17.716 --> 00:16:19.136]  Then they tried to blame that on Slobo.
[00:16:19.416 --> 00:16:20.316]  It was blamed on him.
[00:16:20.356 --> 00:16:21.697]  Oh, look, he blew up all the columns.
[00:16:22.077 --> 00:16:23.857]  Then got retracted months later.
[00:16:23.977 --> 00:16:25.997]  Back of the paper, oh, it was accidental.
[00:16:26.297 --> 00:16:32.779]  Yeah, squadrons of F-16s accidentally dropping bombs on huge convoys of people in open-back trailers.
[00:16:34.359 --> 00:16:37.999]  So it's just the same thing over and over and over again.
[00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:40.940]  He had a sovereign nation.
[00:16:41.747 --> 00:16:42.928]  I don't agree with his politics.
[00:16:42.948 --> 00:16:44.048]  I don't agree with his views.
[00:16:44.068 --> 00:16:45.149]  I don't agree with a lot of things.
[00:16:47.110 --> 00:16:54.293]  And he was not playing ball with the globalists, and he wouldn't let the New World Order banking system take over, just like what's happening in Venezuela right now.
[00:16:55.334 --> 00:17:02.417]  And so in 2000, they staged a CIA coup and overthrew him and killed and assassinated and arrested most of his former ministers.
[00:17:03.334 --> 00:17:10.101]  And they've broken the country up, and the place has been bombed with DU, and the birth defects are almost quadrupled.
[00:17:10.802 --> 00:17:13.625]  Our troops have tripled, but they're not ever in country as long.
[00:17:13.825 --> 00:17:17.169]  They've tripled from the first Cold War, but there's a right at a quadrupling.
[00:17:17.189 --> 00:17:18.150]  Go look at the official numbers.
[00:17:18.510 --> 00:17:21.213]  Just type in birth defect increases in Belgrade.
[00:17:21.293 --> 00:17:21.834]  It's capital.
[00:17:23.535 --> 00:17:24.877]  And so they've been through living hell.
[00:17:25.936 --> 00:17:27.318]  And so he kept testifying.
[00:17:27.338 --> 00:17:33.385]  He kept bringing out the documents and the witnesses of how Al-Qaeda, CIA, and it was all admitted, and there was nothing they could do.
[00:17:33.865 --> 00:17:36.308]  And he exposed all of this, and so they murdered him.
[00:17:36.368 --> 00:17:38.971]  And he said they killed one of the witnesses against him.
[00:17:38.991 --> 00:17:40.673]  He'd been one of his ministers last week.
[00:17:43.496 --> 00:17:46.820]  And, well, that is, had been in the government.
[00:17:47.735 --> 00:17:51.117]  And had testified against him, and he said, they're going to kill me.
[00:17:51.157 --> 00:17:51.437]  That's it.
[00:17:51.457 --> 00:17:52.978]  There's some kind of powder in my food.
[00:17:52.998 --> 00:17:56.099]  I start feeling really bad when I eat it.
[00:17:56.580 --> 00:18:05.644]  And then they tested his blood after his death, and indeed they'd given him the poison, which is known to make you, if you're on these other particular high blood pressure medicines, it's known to interact and kill you.
[00:18:06.165 --> 00:18:07.805]  The Associated Press are admitting it.
[00:18:07.865 --> 00:18:10.807]  But they spit it and go, oh, but he probably took it himself.
[00:18:10.867 --> 00:18:14.109]  Some weird medicine that you give people for other diseases.
[00:18:15.536 --> 00:18:20.345]  And now they're claiming someone smuggled it in and he killed himself with it or was trying to make himself look sick.
[00:18:20.606 --> 00:18:21.688]  No evidence of that, no.
[00:18:22.329 --> 00:18:23.651]  They're killing other witnesses.
[00:18:23.711 --> 00:18:27.077]  He says they're going to kill me and he's dead two days later.
[00:18:28.269 --> 00:18:36.057]  And he's embarrassing them in the trial, and they murdered him in five years, four and a half years of the trial, in their custody for five years.
[00:18:36.737 --> 00:18:38.019]  They couldn't convict him.
[00:18:38.039 --> 00:18:41.022]  They kept bringing in new judges because he was innocent.
[00:18:41.482 --> 00:18:43.184]  He was innocent of what they claimed.
[00:18:43.404 --> 00:18:46.427]  He was the lesser of all of these evils, and I'm not defending him.
[00:18:47.432 --> 00:18:51.574]  But he was a sovereign leader trying to defend his people.
[00:18:52.174 --> 00:19:08.582]  And for that, he was kidnapped and murdered, and his country radiated, and now the South has been given to Al-Ciada, and they're running that heroin right through Afghanistan, right through Iran, right into there today, and it's all admitted.
[00:19:09.689 --> 00:19:15.390]  Oh, as usual, Al-Qaeda bringing down nations, carrying out terror attacks.
[00:19:15.890 --> 00:19:21.531]  Can you imagine if Al-Qaeda was really attacking America every day, every week for two years?
[00:19:22.812 --> 00:19:31.513]  Imagine if the South, Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, that's the equivalent land mass comparatively that Kosovo made up of Serbia.
[00:19:32.794 --> 00:19:34.754]  Imagine, there's attacks every day.
[00:19:35.635 --> 00:19:47.066]  And if the president sent troops into the area to simply go, to fight the military units, and then America, say, got invaded by China and Russia, saying we were engaged in war crimes.
[00:19:48.207 --> 00:19:52.350]  You see, plain view, Al-Qaeda, working for the U.S.
[00:19:52.391 --> 00:19:53.632]  government, as they always do.
[00:19:53.672 --> 00:19:59.377]  I mean, I've got MI6 agents admitting it, that they tried to use them to assassinate Muammar Gaddafi.
[00:20:01.821 --> 00:20:03.502]  What causes foods to spoil?
[00:20:03.922 --> 00:20:06.903]  All produce produces a natural gas which causes ripening.
[00:20:07.223 --> 00:20:12.505]  In addition, foods like onions and garlic emit odors, causing foods to lose their freshness and flavor.
[00:20:12.805 --> 00:20:22.348]  Now there's Forever Fresh for the fridge, a revolutionary new product proven to eliminate refrigerator odors and guaranteed to keep produce fresh at least twice as long as normal.
[00:20:22.628 --> 00:20:24.809]  Nancy McKimson of Jacksonville, Florida says...
[00:20:25.129 --> 00:20:28.672]  Since I started using Forever Fresh, everything stays fresh much longer.
[00:20:28.932 --> 00:20:32.154]  Like strawberries, which now last a couple of weeks instead of just a few days.
[00:20:32.434 --> 00:20:35.977]  Jane Burke of New Jersey says... You know, we eat a lot of salads.
[00:20:36.137 --> 00:20:39.620]  I used to throw out the leftovers because they'd turn brown and they'd shrivel up.
[00:20:39.740 --> 00:20:41.001]  I'm really amazed.
[00:20:41.161 --> 00:20:47.005]  Since I started using Forever Fresh, all my produce stays fresher longer, including the leftovers.
[00:20:47.145 --> 00:20:49.547]  Now I just couldn't get along without Forever Fresh.
[00:20:49.907 --> 00:20:56.379]  To order your Forever Fresh for the fridge, visit the web at foreverfresh.us or call toll-free 1-866-NO-ODERS.
[00:20:56.520 --> 00:20:58.003]  That's 1-866-NO-ODERS.
[00:21:02.731 --> 00:21:03.772]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:21:04.192 --> 00:21:09.675]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[00:21:10.235 --> 00:21:10.735]  That's right.
[00:21:11.056 --> 00:21:13.337]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[00:21:13.897 --> 00:21:20.821]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[00:21:21.388 --> 00:21:29.073]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds, and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[00:21:29.513 --> 00:21:34.376]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[00:21:34.996 --> 00:21:40.419]  If you'd like to take a look at gold free retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[00:21:40.799 --> 00:21:44.922]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[00:21:45.302 --> 00:21:45.582]  Call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:45.602 --> 00:21:45.802]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:01.664 --> 00:22:04.667]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[00:22:05.028 --> 00:22:13.837]  It's portable and requires no water pressure, so you can enjoy healthy drinking water, whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[00:22:14.177 --> 00:22:18.842]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[00:22:19.302 --> 00:22:26.026]  The Berkey Lot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[00:22:26.426 --> 00:22:38.213]  It also removes foul-tasting odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:22:38.673 --> 00:22:43.134]  The Berkey Light's rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.

[00:22:50.396 --> 00:22:51.436]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:23:01.464 --> 00:23:03.866]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:23:04.526 --> 00:23:16.836]  Did you know that those seeking to destroy America and merge us into an all-powerful one-world government said that they support every movement to centralize all authority in Washington, D.C., and therefore bypass the state governments?
[00:23:17.697 --> 00:23:21.381]  That way they would have only one battle to win, Washington, D.C.
[00:23:22.242 --> 00:23:28.388]  Have we witnessed the accumulation of power in Washington and bypassing the states over the last 50 years?
[00:23:29.009 --> 00:23:36.677]  We'd like to help you understand how these things are coming to pass by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[00:23:37.498 --> 00:23:38.999]  Just call our toll-free number, 1-800-516-8736.
[00:23:39.019 --> 00:23:40.419]  That's 1-800-516-8736 to request your subscription.
[00:23:40.580 --> 00:23:41.240]  Call now.
[00:23:41.260 --> 00:23:44.021]  Operators are standing by to receive your call.
[00:24:12.885 --> 00:24:13.366]  Report.
[00:24:13.466 --> 00:24:14.627]  Associated Press.
[00:24:14.727 --> 00:24:16.949]  Milajevic's blood had drug traces.
[00:24:17.009 --> 00:24:21.152]  Traces of a drug used to treat leprosy and tuberculosis.
[00:24:21.212 --> 00:24:28.759]  And that drug, of course, interacts with the known heart medication he was taking and causes heart attacks.
[00:24:28.839 --> 00:24:29.920]  It goes on to report.
[00:24:31.801 --> 00:24:35.825]  The globalists are experts at murdering people by giving them drugs that will interact badly.
[00:24:35.865 --> 00:24:38.287]  And he said, there's some kind of powder in my food.
[00:24:39.045 --> 00:24:39.785]  They're killing me.
[00:24:40.286 --> 00:24:43.247]  Every time I eat, I feel like I'm going to have a heart attack.
[00:24:43.447 --> 00:24:46.188]  They just killed this other guy that testified against me.
[00:24:46.688 --> 00:24:47.088]  Help me.
[00:24:47.188 --> 00:24:48.169]  Help me, please.
[00:24:49.169 --> 00:24:51.670]  And, well, now he's dead.
[00:24:51.690 --> 00:24:54.251]  And it's just so amazing.
[00:24:55.532 --> 00:25:00.694]  Why Milajevic was murdered, tin pot dictator with a whistle on the New World Order.
[00:25:01.394 --> 00:25:05.556]  Slovan Milajevic was a distasteful man with authoritarian communist ideals.
[00:25:06.334 --> 00:25:18.305]  But the reason for his obvious murder revolved around his evergreen willingness to blow the whistle on global criminal masterminds who had made the mistake of giving Slobo a speaking platform in the first place.
[00:25:19.566 --> 00:25:24.370]  Just two days after Milošević's death, the evidence indicating murder has poured in.
[00:25:24.430 --> 00:25:30.616]  Milošević wrote a letter one day before his death claiming he had been poisoned to death in jail.
[00:25:32.091 --> 00:25:34.192]  He was being poisoned to death in jail.
[00:25:34.532 --> 00:25:46.058]  The lawyer who advised Milošević details the trial pictured below showed journalists a handwritten letter in which Milošević wrote, They would like to poison me.
[00:25:46.138 --> 00:25:48.099]  I'm seriously concerned and worried.
[00:25:48.559 --> 00:25:58.864]  Blood tests show that Milošević's body contained a drug that rendered his usual medication for high blood pressure and his heart condition ineffective, causing the heart attack that led to his death.
[00:26:00.393 --> 00:26:01.213]  Well, it's worse than that.
[00:26:01.273 --> 00:26:02.394]  It's known to cause heart attacks.
[00:26:02.914 --> 00:26:11.758]  The media has spun this to make it out as if Milajevic deliberately took the wrong drug so he could seek specialist treatment in Moscow and delay his trial.
[00:26:11.918 --> 00:26:13.079]  This is frankly absurd.
[00:26:13.419 --> 00:26:20.142]  Milajevic only had access to the drugs provided to him by the UN-appointed guards and took them under close surveillance.
[00:26:20.162 --> 00:26:20.422]  That's right.
[00:26:20.442 --> 00:26:25.265]  They'd have three guards in the cell whenever the UN doctor came to see him.
[00:26:25.285 --> 00:26:26.145]  You understand that, folks?
[00:26:27.665 --> 00:26:30.407]  He wasn't even allowed outside to get sun for five years.
[00:26:30.447 --> 00:26:32.269]  I mean, that'll kill you right there, most people.
[00:26:33.029 --> 00:26:35.291]  You need the vitamin A that you get developed in your skin.
[00:26:35.331 --> 00:26:35.992]  Side issue, though.
[00:26:36.632 --> 00:26:46.260]  Are we to believe that Milošević had managed to set up a secret drug lab in his closely watched prison cell and then substituted the drugs while under constant monitoring?
[00:26:47.330 --> 00:26:49.853]  He was 24 hours a day under video surveillance.
[00:26:49.873 --> 00:26:52.416]  A guard physically checked him every 30 minutes.
[00:26:52.436 --> 00:26:53.637]  How were you even supposed to sleep?
[00:26:53.677 --> 00:26:54.678]  See, that's torture, folks.
[00:26:54.979 --> 00:26:56.580]  They'd come in and wake him up for 30 minutes.
[00:26:56.981 --> 00:26:58.743]  This is the stuff he'd been going through for five years.
[00:26:59.423 --> 00:27:00.184]  He deserves it!
[00:27:00.344 --> 00:27:02.327]  Well, if he's so evil, he deserves a fair trial.
[00:27:03.007 --> 00:27:03.208]  See?
[00:27:03.768 --> 00:27:06.111]  But he kept bringing out that the globalists were the real criminals.
[00:27:07.098 --> 00:27:13.920]  Milan Babic, a former Croatian Serb leader who testified against Milošević, was suicided just six days before Milošević's death.
[00:27:13.940 --> 00:27:24.003]  According to BBC Tribunal spokeswoman Aleksandra Milovov, she said he had no indication that he was contemplating suicide.
[00:27:24.023 --> 00:27:26.024]  There was nothing unusual in his demeanor, she said.
[00:27:26.384 --> 00:27:32.566]  Another Hague detainee, Slovako Dominikov, supposedly killed himself in 1998.
[00:27:34.145 --> 00:27:47.255]  Allegations of suicide were dismissed by the British lawyer Stephen K. QC, who said Milošević had told him before he was found dead, I have not come all this way not to see it to the end.
[00:27:48.116 --> 00:27:51.298]  The globalists have wanted to eliminate Milošević for a long time.
[00:27:51.358 --> 00:28:00.225]  Former MI6 agent Richard Tomlinson said he saw documents in 92 that discussed the fascinating Milošević by means of a staged car accident.
[00:28:00.745 --> 00:28:03.127]  MI6 does love to kill people like Diana that way.
[00:28:03.975 --> 00:28:09.337]  By the way, she said, Charles told me he's going to kill me in a stage auto accident if I keep going out with Daddy.
[00:28:10.138 --> 00:28:13.439]  Videotape and her diary.
[00:28:13.459 --> 00:28:17.901]  We have the diary, but the British government raided and took the videotape.
[00:28:18.001 --> 00:28:19.101]  Butler's known public about it.
[00:28:19.401 --> 00:28:20.222]  Just a side issue.
[00:28:20.982 --> 00:28:28.145]  Where the driver would be blinded by a flash of light and remote-controlled brake failure and acted to crash the car.
[00:28:28.545 --> 00:28:30.226]  Oh, mainstream news admits that.
[00:28:30.806 --> 00:28:31.766]  What did they report with Diane?
[00:28:31.806 --> 00:28:33.207]  A flash of light, remote-controlled...
[00:28:33.746 --> 00:28:37.588]  The exact same technique was utilized for real in the murder of Princess Diana.
[00:28:37.928 --> 00:28:46.853]  Milajevic was a loose cannon with intimate knowledge of the criminality of the globalists after the IMF Bilderberg coup d'etat in Serbia in the 1990s.
[00:28:47.393 --> 00:28:59.600]  In March of 2002, Milajevic presented the Hague Tribunal with FBI documents proving, by the way, this is a Senate report, this is admitted, that the United States government and NATO provided financial and military support for Al-Qaeda...
[00:29:00.347 --> 00:29:04.049]  To aid the Coastal Liberation Army in its war against Serbia.
[00:29:04.570 --> 00:29:10.354]  One of the payments Clinton had transferred was $45 million, I would add.
[00:29:10.994 --> 00:29:22.161]  This didn't go well and sit too well with the Pentagon and the White House, who at the time were trying to sell a war on terror and gearing up to justify invading Iraq.
[00:29:22.742 --> 00:29:26.304]  A few more paragraphs and we'll get back, and I'll go to your calls and get into a bunch of other news.
[00:29:27.990 --> 00:29:31.373]  But yeah, he constantly talked about the New World Order and all the things that were happening there.
[00:29:32.274 --> 00:29:33.575]  The Serbs were all getting along.
[00:29:33.595 --> 00:29:34.576]  The Croats were all getting along.
[00:29:34.596 --> 00:29:35.757]  The Muslims were all getting along.
[00:29:36.998 --> 00:29:37.979]  Everybody was getting along.
[00:29:38.279 --> 00:29:43.684]  Not defending Tito, but it was a comparatively free society and people weren't killing each other.
[00:29:44.104 --> 00:29:49.329]  The globalists came in there and busted it all up by design because they wanted those resources.
[00:29:49.809 --> 00:29:50.370]  Now they got them.
[00:29:51.831 --> 00:29:52.772]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.212 --> 00:29:54.714]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.739 --> 00:29:58.415]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[00:32:14.395 --> 00:32:22.297]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:32:22.457 --> 00:32:29.499]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:32:29.719 --> 00:32:30.941]  There are no side effects.

[00:32:50.005 --> 00:32:51.025]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[00:32:51.065 --> 00:32:52.066]  We don't need no education.
[00:32:52.106 --> 00:32:53.726]  We don't need no thought control.
[00:33:20.383 --> 00:33:43.190]  Continuing with the Milajevic murder, Milajevic made several speeches in which he discussed how a group of shadowy internationalists had caused the chaos in the Balkans because it was the next step on the road to a, quote, new world order.
[00:33:43.928 --> 00:33:52.790]  During a February 2000 Serbian Congressional speech, Milošević stated, Small Serbia and people in it have demonstrated that resistance is possible.
[00:33:54.430 --> 00:34:10.854]  Applied at a broader level, it was organized primarily as a moral and political rebellion against tyranny, hegemony, monopolism, and generated hatred, fear, and new forms of violence and revenge against champions of freedom among nations and people.
[00:34:11.274 --> 00:34:12.934]  Such a resistance would not
[00:34:13.717 --> 00:34:17.986]  ...would stop the escalation of modern-time Inquisition.
[00:34:19.748 --> 00:34:32.690]  Uranium bombs, computer manipulations, drug-addicted young assassins, and bribed of blackmailed domestic thugs promoted to the allies of the New World Order.
[00:34:33.130 --> 00:34:44.372]  These are the instruments of Inquisition which have surpassed in their cruelty and cynicism all previous forms of revenge violence committed against the mankind in the past.
[00:34:44.912 --> 00:34:48.293]  And again, that's translated from, I guess, Serbian.
[00:34:48.916 --> 00:34:54.804]  Which is a Slavic tongue, and so it doesn't sound quite right, but it sounds like it's my radio show or something.
[00:34:55.104 --> 00:35:00.551]  Drug-addicted mind-control assassins, new world order control systems, uranium bombs.
[00:35:01.232 --> 00:35:02.073]  That's what's happening.
[00:35:02.334 --> 00:35:03.095]  New world order.
[00:35:04.096 --> 00:35:04.777]  Let me read that again.
[00:35:06.065 --> 00:35:10.128]  Small Serbia and people in it have demonstrated that resistance is possible.
[00:35:10.388 --> 00:35:23.476]  Applied at a broader level, it was organized primarily as a moral and political rebellion against tyranny, hegemony, monopolism, generated hatred, fear, and new forms of violence and revenge against champions of freedom among nations and people.
[00:35:24.017 --> 00:35:29.060]  Such a resistance would stop the escalation of modern-time inquisition.
[00:35:29.640 --> 00:35:30.101]  Woodstock.
[00:35:30.621 --> 00:35:40.968]  Uranium bombs, computer manipulations, drug-addicted young assassins, and bribed or blackmailed domestic thugs promoted to the allies of the New World Order.
[00:35:41.049 --> 00:35:52.457]  These are the instruments of Inquisition, which have surpassed in their cruelty and cynicism all previous forms of revengeful violence committed against the mankind in the past.
[00:35:53.527 --> 00:35:54.168]  Unbelievable.
[00:35:54.228 --> 00:36:03.996]  Milajevic was far from an angel, but evidence linking him to genocides in which 7,000 Muslims dies was continually proven to be fraudulent.
[00:36:04.036 --> 00:36:04.456]  In fact...
[00:36:05.183 --> 00:36:16.989]  The Srebrenica massacre was supposedly a UN safe zone, yet just like Rwanda, UN peacekeepers deliberately withdrew and allowed the massacre to unfold, then blamed Milošević.
[00:36:17.429 --> 00:36:27.914]  Milošević's exposure of UN involvement in the massacre was another reason why tribunal transcripts were heavily edited and censored, and another contributing factor towards his murder.
[00:36:28.314 --> 00:36:35.279]  You understand that they constantly wouldn't let no one in the trial, no witnesses, they would shut it down and then excise the record.
[00:36:35.980 --> 00:36:46.648]  And then they would get new judges, they wouldn't let him have witnesses, witnesses who were going to come testify for him would die in plane crashes or be shot or poisoned outside the prison.
[00:36:47.269 --> 00:36:50.731]  People were dying in the prison, all around him.
[00:36:50.751 --> 00:36:51.652]  I mean, it's just...
[00:36:52.797 --> 00:36:55.258]  If people are so evil, they deserve free trials.
[00:36:55.298 --> 00:37:01.022]  I've heard neocons going, well, you know, Saddam's so horrible, he doesn't deserve a free trial.
[00:37:01.062 --> 00:37:01.922]  Just kill him!
[00:37:03.503 --> 00:37:06.024]  Well, if we would have caught Hitler, shouldn't there have been a trial?
[00:37:06.044 --> 00:37:10.027]  We would have found out how he was supported by British intelligence, now declassified, admitted.
[00:37:10.367 --> 00:37:12.048]  We would have found out how he was funded by U.S.
[00:37:12.088 --> 00:37:12.788]  and British banks.
[00:37:13.288 --> 00:37:17.811]  We would have found out how he was funded by the Zionists, which now even big Israeli papers write about.
[00:37:18.191 --> 00:37:21.473]  The labor Zionists actually supporting Hitler to force the Jews out of Germany.
[00:37:22.446 --> 00:37:23.867]  We would have found out a lot of things.
[00:37:23.967 --> 00:37:25.027]  It's like Saddam.
[00:37:25.067 --> 00:37:27.108]  Every time he tries to get up and says, I was a U.S.
[00:37:27.208 --> 00:37:27.428]  ally.
[00:37:27.488 --> 00:37:28.889]  I was trained by the CIA.
[00:37:29.489 --> 00:37:29.769]  Boom.
[00:37:29.809 --> 00:37:30.850]  They shut off the court.
[00:37:31.110 --> 00:37:31.990]  The judge quits.
[00:37:33.091 --> 00:37:35.232]  Three of Saddam's lawyers have been assassinated.
[00:37:35.252 --> 00:37:37.493]  And they blame it on Al-Qaeda.
[00:37:37.833 --> 00:37:40.795]  Yes, Al-Qaeda killed Saddam's lawyers.
[00:37:41.235 --> 00:37:43.476]  Just like Al-Qaeda attacked Serbia for the U.S.
[00:37:43.516 --> 00:37:44.056]  government.
[00:37:44.656 --> 00:37:48.938]  Al-Qaeda are CIA, Mossad, MI6 Arabs.
[00:37:49.399 --> 00:37:50.099]  Period.
[00:37:50.945 --> 00:37:57.049]  The Arabs that bombed the World Trade Center the first time were one of the few exceptions.
[00:37:57.109 --> 00:38:08.516]  They were patsies, both mentally retarded, registered getting New York welfare, who literally were trained by the FBI and Ahmaud Salon, their informant, cooked the bomb, trained the drivers.
[00:38:08.796 --> 00:38:12.218]  In the other cases, like OKC and 95, we know the names.
[00:38:12.238 --> 00:38:13.098]  We have the police reports.
[00:38:13.279 --> 00:38:14.519]  We've had the police detectives on.
[00:38:14.659 --> 00:38:15.360]  It's admitted.
[00:38:15.700 --> 00:38:17.081]  It's come out in government reports.
[00:38:17.774 --> 00:38:24.625]  That it was a group of Iraqi Republican Guard trained by the CIA in the 80s brought in by George Bush Sr.
[00:38:24.645 --> 00:38:26.708]  and then Bill Clinton brought in 2,000 more, a total of over 5,000.
[00:38:28.783 --> 00:38:30.325]  And they carried out those attacks.
[00:38:30.625 --> 00:38:42.636]  And they're here in America right now, ready to carry out massive attacks, coast to coast, 5,000 hardcore CIA killer Arabs, right now, ready to attack.
[00:38:42.976 --> 00:38:50.263]  And it isn't going to be some Arab nation of the globalists or some Persian nation the globalists want to invade when the bombs go off, boys and girls.
[00:38:53.739 --> 00:38:57.940]  Oh, man, these people are sophisticated, and they know what... It's admitted!
[00:38:58.060 --> 00:38:59.260]  Send that report!
[00:38:59.440 --> 00:39:07.342]  FBI documents publicly admitted that Al-Qaeda launched two and a half years of attacks with U.S.
[00:39:07.382 --> 00:39:08.223]  government funding.
[00:39:08.263 --> 00:39:09.963]  In some cases, U.S.
[00:39:10.003 --> 00:39:13.644]  government paid for helicopters out of Albania with U.S.
[00:39:13.704 --> 00:39:15.384]  pilots flying these people in.
[00:39:15.804 --> 00:39:17.865]  Can you imagine in your sovereign nation?
[00:39:18.525 --> 00:39:25.588]  If a foreign country was flying in terrorists and openly dumping them out to attack you, and then you're not even supposed to defend yourself?
[00:39:26.969 --> 00:39:27.829]  It's admitted!
[00:39:27.889 --> 00:39:30.030]  Go read the Senate report.
[00:39:30.050 --> 00:39:32.712]  I forget the exact name of the report.
[00:39:32.752 --> 00:39:33.612]  I've got it in the film.
[00:39:34.072 --> 00:39:35.533]  Just type in Alphonse D'Amato.
[00:39:36.013 --> 00:39:37.113]  He was the chairman of the committee.
[00:39:37.234 --> 00:39:38.034]  Senate report.
[00:39:39.294 --> 00:39:42.475]  He made it political, though.
[00:39:43.235 --> 00:39:45.256]  Just try Clinton funding of Al-Qaeda.
[00:39:45.556 --> 00:39:47.376]  Clinton funding of KLA.
[00:39:49.017 --> 00:39:51.097]  Bill Clinton, $45 million to Iran.
[00:39:52.377 --> 00:39:53.758]  Just try stuff like that.
[00:39:56.338 --> 00:39:57.078]  And you'll get it.
[00:39:58.759 --> 00:40:03.100]  Imagine thousands of hardcore trained CIA Arabs attacking you.
[00:40:03.795 --> 00:40:07.336]  Well, they've got their same people here in America right now, just waiting.
[00:40:07.377 --> 00:40:08.857]  These guys make millions a year.
[00:40:09.277 --> 00:40:10.718]  They live lavish lifestyles.
[00:40:10.738 --> 00:40:11.718]  They're very cynical.
[00:40:12.659 --> 00:40:14.820]  And sometimes they get sold out, though.
[00:40:15.800 --> 00:40:20.562]  Sometimes they think they're taking part in a drill to test the local authorities, and they get on board a plane and Nerf gas gets released when they die.
[00:40:21.320 --> 00:40:27.884]  And then right out in plain view, it doesn't matter if the deans of defense language schools say that they're U.S.
[00:40:27.904 --> 00:40:29.405]  government agents, they were forced to train them.
[00:40:29.425 --> 00:40:31.567]  It doesn't matter if they were trained at Pensacola Naval Air Station.
[00:40:31.587 --> 00:40:33.248]  It doesn't matter if the heads of U.S.
[00:40:33.308 --> 00:40:35.869]  embassies go public and say that they were told that the hijackers were U.S.
[00:40:35.889 --> 00:40:37.350]  government agents and let them back in.
[00:40:37.370 --> 00:40:41.133]  It was part of a high-level, super-secret National Security Council terror drill.
[00:40:41.593 --> 00:40:42.313]  That's all public.
[00:40:43.694 --> 00:40:44.615]  In triplicate...
[00:40:46.081 --> 00:40:57.123]  We have three major links, three major nexus points, matrix links, showing, one of them is open and shut case proving they were government agents.
[00:40:58.571 --> 00:40:58.912]  One of them.
[00:40:58.932 --> 00:41:02.015]  We have three just being trained at U.S.
[00:41:02.075 --> 00:41:04.958]  bases in top-level spy training, espionage training.
[00:41:05.379 --> 00:41:11.966]  Then we have a bunch of other links overseas, and then other links in funding, and then links in the founding.
[00:41:12.326 --> 00:41:13.607]  There's hundreds of them.
[00:41:13.647 --> 00:41:15.229]  I mean, it's ridiculous.
[00:41:15.609 --> 00:41:16.851]  The facts are there.
[00:41:16.951 --> 00:41:19.874]  The question is, are you willing to face it?
[00:41:22.518 --> 00:41:25.260]  But Alex, the Arabs say they want to kill us.
[00:41:25.401 --> 00:41:26.902]  Do you hear me?
[00:41:26.942 --> 00:41:39.012]  Yes, there are some real Arabs, some real Muslims, some real Persians, some real Central Asians, who may go out and shoot people or carry out some bombings.
[00:41:39.032 --> 00:41:44.197]  There are real people who are nuts, who are Islamists, who may carry out terror attacks.
[00:41:44.217 --> 00:41:45.458]  And I'm not afraid of them.
[00:41:45.478 --> 00:41:46.258]  I'm not worried about them.
[00:41:46.298 --> 00:41:47.860]  Statistically, they can do almost nothing.
[00:41:48.984 --> 00:41:56.187]  They're badly coordinated, and on down the line, their original founding and funding comes from the West as well.
[00:41:56.247 --> 00:41:56.927]  We've proven that.
[00:41:58.707 --> 00:42:12.052]  But if you want to talk about real, massive, devastating A-bomb attacks, planes flying into buildings, bridges getting blown up, people putting nerve gas in high-rise buildings and killing whole buildings, baby...
[00:42:13.436 --> 00:42:19.179]  There's one group and one group alone that can do it, and it's called the NWO.
[00:42:20.579 --> 00:42:21.500]  And I'm sweating bullets.
[00:42:21.560 --> 00:42:24.481]  I mean, I'm up here with white knuckles at 1 a.m.
[00:42:24.541 --> 00:42:27.263]  last night working, you know, busting.
[00:42:27.723 --> 00:42:28.523]  I'm not bragging.
[00:42:28.583 --> 00:42:34.946]  I'm trying to let you realize how desperate this is, how serious this is, how frantic this is.
[00:42:35.506 --> 00:42:40.489]  I mean, I'm up here tired with a headache, not wanting to work, doing voiceovers and working on this new film at 1 a.m.
[00:42:44.384 --> 00:42:47.845]  On a Sunday night, because I know, I mean, this is life and death.
[00:42:48.725 --> 00:42:49.566]  This isn't a joke.
[00:42:49.606 --> 00:42:50.386]  This isn't a game.
[00:42:50.586 --> 00:42:51.446]  This isn't a drill.
[00:42:51.706 --> 00:42:54.407]  This is the new world order coming down on us.
[00:42:57.728 --> 00:43:03.350]  Another round of attacks, or one big attack, and they're going to try to bring in full-bore official martial law.
[00:43:05.011 --> 00:43:11.913]  And if we don't have a massive understanding, a telegraphing right now from person to person,
[00:43:12.906 --> 00:43:14.227]  And things like that happen.
[00:43:14.247 --> 00:43:15.368]  In fact, it's already happening.
[00:43:16.349 --> 00:43:17.410]  Who's behind the terror?
[00:43:17.470 --> 00:43:18.771]  Who stands to gain from it?
[00:43:19.051 --> 00:43:20.532]  Then we're going to lose everything.
[00:43:20.912 --> 00:43:22.173]  I hope you realize that.
[00:43:23.334 --> 00:43:27.017]  All right, I've got a bunch of calls here and a lot of other news I want to get into.
[00:43:27.077 --> 00:43:29.079]  It's just they clearly murdered Salim Malajovic.
[00:43:31.220 --> 00:43:38.726]  And just another example of how Al-Qaeda is just U.S.
[00:43:39.307 --> 00:43:40.648]  special forces is all they are.
[00:43:41.588 --> 00:43:41.869]  They're...
[00:43:43.087 --> 00:43:50.753]  They're black world, as they're called, special ops, Arab or dark-skinned operatives.
[00:43:50.773 --> 00:43:57.918]  There's a lot of Latin Americans posing who are taught Arabic, posing as terrorists as well.
[00:43:58.679 --> 00:43:59.539]  We've seen that a lot.
[00:44:00.980 --> 00:44:02.261]  And it's just heaven help us.
[00:44:03.462 --> 00:44:05.083]  Michael in Maryland, you're on the air.
[00:44:05.123 --> 00:44:05.564]  Go ahead.
[00:44:05.864 --> 00:44:06.484]  Thank you for letting me call.
[00:44:06.524 --> 00:44:09.126]  I bet Saddam Hussein is feeling pretty nervous right now, isn't he?
[00:44:10.067 --> 00:44:11.128]  After what happened to Slovo.
[00:44:12.205 --> 00:44:12.465]  Yes.
[00:44:12.965 --> 00:44:14.826]  And that's even him.
[00:44:14.866 --> 00:44:15.407]  We don't even know.
[00:44:15.767 --> 00:44:16.527]  No, that's true, too.
[00:44:18.849 --> 00:44:22.951]  It's funny how they repeat themselves, like with Princess Di and everything.
[00:44:23.431 --> 00:44:25.172]  But I wanted to get your opinion.
[00:44:25.492 --> 00:44:27.833]  What do you make of the shortage of ammunition now?
[00:44:28.353 --> 00:44:34.717]  And that's 7.62x39 and .223, and I think even 9mm gun shows.
[00:44:34.737 --> 00:44:38.879]  Do you think this is part of a grander scheme, or is this just, as somebody said,
[00:44:39.468 --> 00:44:43.031]  This is needed for the war effort in Iraq, and the government's buying it up for that.
[00:44:43.251 --> 00:44:45.994]  Well, 7.6239, used in the AK-47 and its different variants, like the MAC-90...
[00:44:52.027 --> 00:45:00.854]  That's not being used by coalition forces over in Iraq, and I have heard that you can't even get the foreign ammo.
[00:45:00.874 --> 00:45:03.756]  I'm told there's been some restrictions on its importation.
[00:45:03.816 --> 00:45:13.063]  Bob Barr, an NRA board member, told us when he joined us a few months ago that Bush isn't passing anti-gun laws because he's tried and failed, and that he's, quote, more anti-gun than Bill Clinton.
[00:45:13.928 --> 00:45:15.790]  But he's an evil liberal, so why believe Bob Barr?
[00:45:16.950 --> 00:45:18.472]  But let me just finish.
[00:45:18.672 --> 00:45:18.872]  Sure.
[00:45:18.992 --> 00:45:30.021]  But that Bush, just through regulation, is barring the importation of a lot of 7.6239 or foreign ammo, period, and foreign firearms.
[00:45:31.062 --> 00:45:31.402]  Okay.
[00:45:32.123 --> 00:45:38.788]  And I've been hearing things on other stations, on the GCN network as well, about double and triple-decker guns.
[00:45:39.704 --> 00:45:42.569]  Box cars that may have some kind of nefarious purpose.
[00:45:42.609 --> 00:45:44.012]  Have you been hearing about that as well?
[00:45:44.132 --> 00:45:46.216]  Yeah, I've been hearing about that for 12 years.
[00:45:47.515 --> 00:45:48.716]  Yes, there are these portable cells.
[00:46:15.865 --> 00:46:19.886]  But people constantly talk about them, and it's just part and parcel of all this.
[00:46:21.046 --> 00:46:27.368]  We have the Houston Chronicle admitting that Halliburton's running these camps now in America.
[00:46:27.908 --> 00:46:28.788]  Drew in Texas.
[00:46:28.828 --> 00:46:29.728]  Drew, you're on the air.
[00:46:30.448 --> 00:46:31.009]  Hey, Alex.
[00:46:31.049 --> 00:46:31.569]  How you doing?
[00:46:31.589 --> 00:46:32.489]  Good to talk to you again.
[00:46:32.529 --> 00:46:34.049]  Good to talk to you.
[00:46:34.069 --> 00:46:36.250]  I recently saw your new video, Order of Death.
[00:46:36.310 --> 00:46:37.070]  It's excellent.
[00:46:37.670 --> 00:46:38.050]  Thank you.
[00:46:39.211 --> 00:46:43.311]  Did you read Saturday's edition of The Un-American Snakesman?
[00:46:44.852 --> 00:46:45.352]  No, I didn't.
[00:46:45.740 --> 00:46:48.581]  Okay, there's a very interesting article in there.
[00:46:50.262 --> 00:46:54.023]  Anti-Bush sermon sparks mixed reaction among congregation.
[00:46:54.763 --> 00:47:08.929]  The Unitarian minister, Davidson Lohr, of the First Unitarian Universalist Church, gave a sermon on Sunday, September 12th, and in the sermon he said that the Bush administration
[00:47:09.936 --> 00:47:24.749]  Yeah, I have a friend who knows the pastor of that church.
[00:47:26.211 --> 00:47:31.035]  And I know for a fact that he has been giving my videos.
[00:47:31.896 --> 00:47:33.037]  I'm not tooting our own horn.
[00:47:33.077 --> 00:47:35.519]  It just shows what giving somebody videos did.
[00:47:36.742 --> 00:47:51.149]  And I'm not attributing all of it to us, but I didn't see that article, but I knew that he had been giving speeches to that effect and saying we're about to go into martial law, and that a minority of his...
[00:47:52.412 --> 00:47:54.212]  ...of his flock did not like it.
[00:47:54.532 --> 00:47:56.013]  Yeah, I've got the article right here.
[00:47:56.333 --> 00:47:57.613]  What's the headline on that?
[00:47:57.653 --> 00:47:58.373]  I want to find that.
[00:47:58.693 --> 00:48:01.294]  Okay, it's in Section B of Saturday's paper.
[00:48:01.934 --> 00:48:05.275]  The headline is, Pulpit Politics Divide Unitarian Church.
[00:48:05.315 --> 00:48:07.235]  Pulpit Politics Divide Unitarian Church.
[00:48:07.515 --> 00:48:07.735]  Yeah.
[00:48:08.115 --> 00:48:10.256]  I put a call in to him earlier this morning.
[00:48:10.456 --> 00:48:16.757]  I'm going to try to arrange to show... I'd like to show his congregation 9-11 Road to Tyranny sometime.
[00:48:17.406 --> 00:48:18.727]  Well, I would show them martial law.
[00:48:18.747 --> 00:48:20.408]  I think that's... And I'd just show them an hour of it.
[00:48:20.428 --> 00:48:22.189]  I don't think people could sit through three hours at a church.
[00:48:22.310 --> 00:48:22.670]  Yeah.
[00:48:23.430 --> 00:48:27.093]  Okay, so you... Of course, my pen quit working during the middle of writing that.
[00:48:27.433 --> 00:48:29.314]  Pulpit Politics Divide Unitarian Church.
[00:48:29.334 --> 00:48:30.575]  Yeah, that's the headline.
[00:48:30.595 --> 00:48:34.978]  I believe it's on page D1 of Saturday's edition.
[00:48:35.339 --> 00:48:37.060]  So, I'm intrigued.
[00:48:37.080 --> 00:48:37.961]  What does the article say?
[00:48:38.341 --> 00:48:40.322]  Okay, well, let me read a little bit more of it.
[00:48:41.343 --> 00:48:41.843]  Okay...
[00:48:44.301 --> 00:48:45.742]  But February 12th was different.
[00:48:45.822 --> 00:48:54.285]  Long-time church member Karina Lewis said he accused people of murder without significant evidence to back it up.
[00:48:55.986 --> 00:48:59.587]  Lewis and her husband were among those who walked out of Laura's sermon.
[00:48:59.607 --> 00:49:04.749]  Among those who stayed, Laura said about 80 people stood up and applauded.
[00:49:06.319 --> 00:49:07.741]  And let me read down farther.
[00:49:07.921 --> 00:49:11.083]  Now, I've gone and given a speech there once.
[00:49:11.144 --> 00:49:12.565]  It's a small little church.
[00:49:12.645 --> 00:49:13.185]  It's liberal.
[00:49:13.906 --> 00:49:18.710]  And that's what I was told, people that were there, is that it was just a couple people walked out.
[00:49:18.750 --> 00:49:21.693]  And notice the statement tries to act like it was a bunch of people.
[00:49:21.973 --> 00:49:23.815]  Yeah, well, it said 80 people stayed.
[00:49:23.835 --> 00:49:27.758]  So I mentioned that's the vast majority of the people stayed, and they applauded his sermon.
[00:49:29.181 --> 00:49:29.762]  Well, it goes on.
[00:49:29.822 --> 00:49:42.323]  It says his essay posted on a different website claims the United States government planned to establish a new world order which would benefit the wealthy, quoting from the statement here.
[00:49:43.775 --> 00:49:44.936]  Well, that's what PNAC said.
[00:49:44.956 --> 00:49:50.523]  They said we need helpful terror attacks on the order of or bigger than Pearl Harbor to mobilize the people.
[00:49:50.563 --> 00:49:52.185]  Brzezinski calls us the slaves.
[00:49:52.825 --> 00:49:53.166]  Oh, I know.
[00:49:53.186 --> 00:49:55.148]  They need terror attacks to mobilize the slaves.
[00:49:55.668 --> 00:49:56.750]  The Grand Chef Board in 1974, right?
[00:49:56.790 --> 00:49:57.190]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:49:57.250 --> 00:49:57.330]  And...
[00:49:59.993 --> 00:50:02.855]  Then on top of that, we actually, that was 1997.
[00:50:03.375 --> 00:50:13.761]  And then, on top of it, we have Gary Hart getting up on C-SPAN three days after 9-11 and saying we need to use this disaster for a new world order.
[00:50:13.981 --> 00:50:15.162]  I've got it on your video.
[00:50:15.202 --> 00:50:16.702]  Please state three total enslavement.
[00:50:17.883 --> 00:50:18.043]  Yeah.
[00:50:19.304 --> 00:50:19.884]  It's amazing.
[00:50:19.924 --> 00:50:21.065]  So what else does it say about him?
[00:50:22.085 --> 00:50:23.886]  Okay, they do have a website.
[00:50:24.047 --> 00:50:24.167]  It's...
[00:50:26.147 --> 00:50:31.232]  Austin, A-U-S-T-I-N, U-U dot org, if anybody wants to go and check it out.
[00:50:32.753 --> 00:50:36.957]  So does the paper call for him to get in trouble or anything?
[00:50:36.977 --> 00:50:40.701]  No, he kind of apologizes about it, though.
[00:50:40.741 --> 00:50:44.024]  It sounds like he caught a bunch of heat and he's kind of...
[00:50:44.744 --> 00:50:46.526]  You know, he's kind of getting a little meek over it.
[00:50:46.967 --> 00:50:48.388]  Well, look, they can't stop us all.
[00:50:48.629 --> 00:50:49.590]  They can't get us all.
[00:50:50.211 --> 00:50:52.854]  The majority of Americans in major polls know the truth now.
[00:50:53.575 --> 00:50:54.576]  And they're not going to stop us.
[00:50:54.616 --> 00:50:56.298]  We're going to expose the murdering terrorists.
[00:50:56.638 --> 00:50:58.601]  And we do show evidence of who the murderers are.
[00:51:03.146 --> 00:51:05.988]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[00:51:06.249 --> 00:51:06.949]  Hello, my friends.
[00:51:07.049 --> 00:51:07.830]  Alex Jones here.
[00:51:08.170 --> 00:51:12.854]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law, 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[00:51:13.194 --> 00:51:19.920]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[00:51:20.240 --> 00:51:22.242]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[00:51:22.442 --> 00:51:25.284]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[00:51:25.384 --> 00:51:30.027]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.

[00:54:05.609 --> 00:54:07.130]  This show is documented.
[00:54:07.650 --> 00:54:10.432]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:10.812 --> 00:54:13.974]  I fell into a burning ring of fire.
[00:54:14.014 --> 00:54:16.435]  Pulpit politics provide Unitarian Church.
[00:54:16.575 --> 00:54:30.844]  I do need to go to that church and show just an hour, the hour that covers 9-11 from martial law, and show that to the statesman writer, Ellen E. Flynn, who tries to do this hit piece on him, and show it to the congregation.
[00:54:32.145 --> 00:54:33.728]  Because we don't have proof?
[00:54:33.748 --> 00:54:34.549]  What are you talking about?
[00:54:34.589 --> 00:54:35.570]  There's total proof.
[00:54:36.672 --> 00:54:37.653]  There's total proof.
[00:54:39.236 --> 00:54:42.540]  But it is satisfying to just see more and more people just going, you know what?
[00:54:42.841 --> 00:54:47.548]  The king has no clothes, the emperor's totally naked, and you guys are a bunch of terrorists.
[00:54:48.603 --> 00:54:51.305]  And what needs to happen to save this country is happening.
[00:54:51.545 --> 00:54:57.469]  And believe me, Global, if you carry out more terror, you're going to be surprised when millions of people hit the streets going, You did it!
[00:54:57.789 --> 00:54:58.950]  Just like they did in Madrid.
[00:54:59.310 --> 00:54:59.651]  Boom.
[00:54:59.751 --> 00:55:00.211]  Next day.
[00:55:00.291 --> 00:55:01.032]  You did it!
[00:55:01.052 --> 00:55:01.892]  They knew right away.
[00:55:02.092 --> 00:55:02.833]  You did it!
[00:55:02.993 --> 00:55:03.513]  Government!
[00:55:06.895 --> 00:55:10.058]  You're not going to stop us from exposing you, you murdering trash.
[00:55:10.238 --> 00:55:11.999]  You murdered all those people in those buildings.
[00:55:12.139 --> 00:55:13.600]  You think you're going to enslave all of us?
[00:55:14.338 --> 00:55:18.319]  I mean, this is a government that openly has rape rooms, okay?
[00:55:18.439 --> 00:55:22.479]  They say they can torture small children in front of their parents, but it's good when they do it.
[00:55:22.539 --> 00:55:24.300]  It's bad when Saddam allegedly did it.
[00:55:26.180 --> 00:55:31.481]  So if there's any doubt, this is a government that nerve-gasses its own troops in tests, that radiates babies.
[00:55:32.201 --> 00:55:35.262]  So the denial is going to end, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:55:36.102 --> 00:55:40.162]  We have psychopathic elite running things, and George Bush is just a puppet.
[00:55:42.243 --> 00:55:43.323]  I'm going to take a call here.
[00:55:45.350 --> 00:55:47.992]  We're going to go to Chris and Kim and others.
[00:55:48.812 --> 00:55:51.094]  We'll call Jim Tucker about five after.
[00:55:51.854 --> 00:55:54.896]  But we've got a deal for the rest of this month.
[00:55:56.057 --> 00:56:03.162]  You get 5.3, almost half a year free, when you sign up for a yearly membership at prisonplanet.tv.
[00:56:03.562 --> 00:56:04.723]  All 14 of my films.
[00:56:04.743 --> 00:56:06.764]  You get them weeks before new films come out.
[00:56:07.124 --> 00:56:09.846]  My weekly TV reports at One Best of Austin and the local paper.
[00:56:10.327 --> 00:56:10.927]  It's a pretty good show.
[00:56:12.565 --> 00:56:15.728]  Videotape live interviews here in studio with guests.
[00:56:16.449 --> 00:56:21.974]  You get a bunch of other films that have been authorized to post, like Loose Change 2 and Ted Pike's Why the Mideast Bleeds.
[00:56:23.576 --> 00:56:25.417]  You also get all my best audio interviews.
[00:56:25.678 --> 00:56:26.879]  My book, Paul Watson's book.
[00:56:26.899 --> 00:56:28.520]  There's over 1,000 pieces of media there.
[00:56:28.741 --> 00:56:31.363]  We're coming up on the two-year anniversary of PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:56:31.383 --> 00:56:32.865]  It just gets better and better.
[00:56:32.885 --> 00:56:35.047]  15 cents a day to get a monthly membership.
[00:56:35.067 --> 00:56:35.547]  It's $5.95 for a month.
[00:56:36.874 --> 00:56:38.695]  A cup of coffee is like $1.50, folks.
[00:56:39.296 --> 00:56:43.478]  And your purchase makes the bandwidth possible, makes all the other sites and what we do possible.
[00:56:43.798 --> 00:56:44.439]  It funds that.
[00:56:45.579 --> 00:56:48.661]  So go to prisonplanet.tv and get a 15-cent-a-day membership.
[00:56:50.402 --> 00:56:53.164]  Or get a yearly membership that's even less than 15 cents a day.
[00:56:53.184 --> 00:56:54.885]  You get almost half a year free.
[00:56:54.905 --> 00:56:56.746]  And that's going to the end of the month.
[00:56:57.086 --> 00:56:58.808]  Or call toll-free to get any of the films.
[00:56:58.828 --> 00:57:01.009]  I've got a bunch of books and videos we carry, not just my films.
[00:57:01.741 --> 00:57:08.445]  On VHS and DVD, books on tape, you name it.
[00:57:08.465 --> 00:57:08.866]  1-888-253-3139.
[00:57:08.886 --> 00:57:11.267]  And you make what we do here possible.
[00:57:13.429 --> 00:57:16.130]  And I hire as many people and do as much work as we have support.
[00:57:16.170 --> 00:57:18.812]  When we get support, we just expand and do more with it and fight more.
[00:57:19.573 --> 00:57:24.055]  And I don't know of anybody else who just puts this much of what comes into the fight.
[00:57:24.095 --> 00:57:26.717]  I mean, we're just point-blank range fighting the rule of order.
[00:57:27.378 --> 00:57:29.519]  Busting our hind ends here.
[00:57:30.413 --> 00:57:32.354]  Plus, these are powerful films and videos you need to have.
[00:57:32.374 --> 00:57:33.615]  You can make copies of all my films.
[00:57:33.896 --> 00:57:39.179]  PrisonPlanet.tv is a great activist tool to download my films, burn copies of them, give them to people.
[00:57:39.800 --> 00:57:47.105]  PrisonPlanet.tv or Infowars.com to order hard copies of the DVDs or VHS or pro-gun t-shirts or citizen rule books.
[00:57:47.586 --> 00:57:50.988]  PrisonPlanet.tv or Infowars.com or 1-888-253-3139.
[00:57:55.993 --> 00:57:56.553]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:57:56.693 --> 00:58:02.455]  All that evil men and tyrants need to flourish is the good men and women do nothing.
[00:58:03.115 --> 00:58:05.416]  And I ask you folks, what are you going to do to expose these people?
[00:58:06.036 --> 00:58:07.217]  I mean, just face the facts.
[00:58:07.997 --> 00:58:10.218]  Nineteen people in caves didn't carry out those attacks.
[00:58:10.258 --> 00:58:11.698]  They didn't have NORAD stand down.
[00:58:11.998 --> 00:58:13.999]  They didn't do CIA insider trading.
[00:58:14.199 --> 00:58:17.100]  They didn't warn mayors and politicians not to fly the night before.
[00:58:17.700 --> 00:58:20.921]  They didn't do drills of the exact same targets being hit at the exact same time.
[00:58:22.281 --> 00:58:22.622]  They didn't...
[00:58:24.898 --> 00:58:25.718]  It's just incredible.
[00:58:25.778 --> 00:58:26.659]  There's so much evidence.
[00:58:26.719 --> 00:58:28.860]  It's sick, it's scary, but it's the real world.
[00:58:29.300 --> 00:58:32.401]  And it's empowering and enlightening and good to know the truth.
[00:58:33.682 --> 00:58:35.362]  So, get involved in the fight.
[00:58:35.422 --> 00:58:37.843]  Dr. Chris and Kim will get back, and we'll get Jim Tucker on the line.
[00:58:38.124 --> 00:58:40.785]  Stay with us.
[00:58:41.665 --> 00:58:46.247]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[00:58:58.041 --> 00:58:58.682]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.342 --> 00:59:00.403]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:01.123 --> 00:59:02.244]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.884 --> 00:59:03.705]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.466 --> 00:59:05.346]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.366 --> 00:59:09.669]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.210 --> 00:59:14.312]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:20.236 --> 00:59:25.140]  Breaking down the new world order.
[00:59:26.742 --> 00:59:30.665]  Unraveling their propaganda, exposing and chronicling their crimes.
[00:59:30.866 --> 00:59:31.987]  Party into the second hour.
[00:59:32.767 --> 00:59:35.269]  We talk about Slava Milajevic, clearly murdered, poisoned.
[00:59:35.329 --> 00:59:35.870]  It's admitted.
[00:59:36.190 --> 00:59:37.391]  Poison, you know, had the poison in him.
[00:59:38.452 --> 00:59:40.133]  And they just do it in your face now.
[00:59:41.514 --> 00:59:43.196]  Busy killing other people at the jail.
[00:59:45.177 --> 00:59:50.562]  But they didn't dare try to claim he committed suicide because he said they're going to kill me and say I committed suicide.
[00:59:52.870 --> 00:59:55.251]  There's a lot of other important news we'll be covering in this hour.
[00:59:55.411 --> 01:00:00.974]  Number two at Homeland Security, former number two at Homeland Security, caught stealing, allegedly.
[01:00:01.794 --> 01:00:03.295]  The police have arrested him.
[01:00:04.515 --> 01:00:05.216]  We'll get into that.
[01:00:05.236 --> 01:00:07.737]  We're going to be joined by Jim Tucker here in just a few minutes.
[01:00:07.837 --> 01:00:09.718]  Right now, let's go to the calls.
[01:00:09.958 --> 01:00:12.279]  Let's talk to Chris in New Hampshire, then Kim in Texas.
[01:00:12.639 --> 01:00:13.419]  Chris, you're on the air.
[01:00:14.280 --> 01:00:14.680]  Hey, Alex.
[01:00:14.700 --> 01:00:15.200]  Thanks a lot.
[01:00:15.520 --> 01:00:16.901]  You bet.
[01:00:16.921 --> 01:00:18.642]  Have you heard of Sherry Schreiner?
[01:00:21.463 --> 01:00:21.583]  No.
[01:00:22.418 --> 01:00:23.319]  Okay, she's a woman.
[01:00:23.339 --> 01:00:33.543]  She has about 25 websites, sherryfrenner.com, and she's interviewed lots of other people who have lots of them, and she's a real pain in the behind of the New World Order, so I don't know.
[01:00:33.804 --> 01:00:44.409]  She has lots of interesting ideas and brings out a lot of different... The name rings a nebulous bell, but I just can't place it, so I'll let her know.
[01:00:44.429 --> 01:00:48.991]  You would probably put her in the category of Jordan Maxwell or David Icke.
[01:00:49.171 --> 01:00:51.032]  Well, I heard that Maxwell actually...
[01:00:53.831 --> 01:00:54.851]  Maxwell kind of what?
[01:00:56.051 --> 01:00:56.211]  Okay.
[01:00:56.231 --> 01:00:56.971]  No, that's interesting.
[01:00:57.031 --> 01:00:58.192]  I'm surprised I haven't heard of her.
[01:00:58.232 --> 01:00:59.132]  Thank you so much.
[01:00:59.152 --> 01:01:02.633]  I appreciate that call, Chris.
[01:01:02.653 --> 01:01:02.993]  Kim in Texas.
[01:01:03.013 --> 01:01:03.793]  Kim, you're on the air.
[01:01:03.833 --> 01:01:04.053]  Welcome.
[01:01:20.015 --> 01:01:24.018]  I was calling about the illegal aliens and some other things right quick.
[01:01:24.198 --> 01:01:24.518]  Yes.
[01:01:24.838 --> 01:01:30.442]  I wanted to say that our teenagers are in trouble because illegal aliens have taken their jobs.
[01:01:30.622 --> 01:01:33.564]  Teenagers can't get jobs at McDonald's and all that anymore.
[01:01:34.224 --> 01:01:41.869]  And also, when drug dealers and bank robbers, do they get to keep the money that they steal and make illegally?
[01:01:42.390 --> 01:01:45.892]  And when people say, why should illegal aliens lose everything they work for here?
[01:01:46.377 --> 01:01:49.640]  Well, they came here legally, but you don't get to keep anything when you come here.
[01:01:49.660 --> 01:01:51.321]  Well, look, it boils down to this.
[01:01:51.341 --> 01:01:53.643]  I don't even have anything against the illegal aliens.
[01:01:53.703 --> 01:01:54.184]  I don't either.
[01:01:54.324 --> 01:01:54.884]  It's this.
[01:01:55.325 --> 01:01:59.108]  There are 6.5 billion people now in the world.
[01:02:00.989 --> 01:02:04.012]  Folks, please don't send me an email saying you said 6.3 billion.
[01:02:04.032 --> 01:02:05.893]  The new numbers are out.
[01:02:05.954 --> 01:02:06.934]  6.5 billion people.
[01:02:07.835 --> 01:02:09.396]  And they all want to come here.
[01:02:09.797 --> 01:02:12.719]  And the population of Mexico is doubling every 30 years.
[01:02:13.080 --> 01:02:14.581]  They've gone from just 10 million...
[01:02:15.646 --> 01:02:24.833]  What, 70 years ago to 40 million, 20, 30 years ago to almost 100 million now, and Latin America is doubling every 30 years.
[01:02:24.853 --> 01:02:27.696]  I mean, we're just going to have billions of people here?
[01:02:28.756 --> 01:02:31.539]  Bottom line, globalization is destroying this country.
[01:02:31.599 --> 01:02:33.000]  George Bush is for open borders.
[01:02:33.260 --> 01:02:34.681]  He's bad on everything, folks.
[01:02:34.921 --> 01:02:36.723]  So why is he good on the borders being open?
[01:02:36.743 --> 01:02:38.184]  They make it a liberal issue.
[01:02:39.285 --> 01:02:42.187]  And want liberals to then go support it as if it's a litmus test.
[01:02:42.427 --> 01:02:44.348]  To be a Democrat, you've got to be for open borders.
[01:02:44.709 --> 01:02:45.129]  It's funny.
[01:02:45.169 --> 01:02:47.811]  Most of the Hispanic Americans I know don't want open borders.
[01:02:47.851 --> 01:02:49.552]  They know it's driving down their wages.
[01:02:50.052 --> 01:02:50.993]  They're not stupid.
[01:02:51.774 --> 01:02:52.754]  It's just like abortion.
[01:02:52.815 --> 01:02:54.956]  Most of the so-called liberals I know are against abortion.
[01:02:55.336 --> 01:02:56.257]  I'm against abortion.
[01:02:57.438 --> 01:03:04.223]  Liberals need to stop thinking, oh, my party's against abortion, or for abortion, so I've got to be for it.
[01:03:05.839 --> 01:03:06.499]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[01:03:06.819 --> 01:03:18.361]  Also, Friday, I was waiting to talk to you about this Friday because you did such a great imitation of them when they finally win, when the New World Order wins, and they just sent it to Specter and Session.
[01:03:18.741 --> 01:03:31.064]  This man did a minute of ranting about how they won, how Session and Specter won on the... They said, we got the Patriot Act, we got the Supreme Court now, and Senator Goldfein is just crazy.
[01:03:31.104 --> 01:03:33.304]  He's out of his mind for something he tried to get past.
[01:03:34.116 --> 01:03:35.618]  Where did you see this?
[01:03:35.918 --> 01:03:36.579]  On C-SPAN.
[01:03:36.799 --> 01:03:37.680]  Right there on C-SPAN.
[01:03:37.700 --> 01:03:40.824]  They was doing the... You know, I got Jim Tucker coming up, but I want to hear about this.
[01:03:40.864 --> 01:03:42.166]  Will you hold so I can go back to you later?
[01:03:42.186 --> 01:03:43.808]  All right, we'll be right back.
[01:03:43.848 --> 01:03:45.329]  Jim Tucker coming up.
[01:03:47.192 --> 01:03:47.832]  Oh, they love it.
[01:03:47.873 --> 01:03:49.795]  Yeah, you're our slave, scum.
[01:03:49.815 --> 01:03:51.277]  Learn to lay on a ticket!
[01:03:53.777 --> 01:03:55.277]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:03:55.478 --> 01:03:58.558]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[01:03:58.698 --> 01:04:02.600]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[01:04:02.640 --> 01:04:06.881]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2, The Takeover.
[01:04:07.221 --> 01:04:10.982]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[01:04:11.122 --> 01:04:12.963]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[01:04:13.143 --> 01:04:16.464]  Riot police attacked people on the street indiscriminately.
[01:04:16.484 --> 01:04:17.564]  The medical bills.
[01:04:19.185 --> 01:04:21.206]  Are going to be enormous for me.
[01:04:21.346 --> 01:04:24.387]  You see them here with their hands cuffed behind their backs.
[01:04:24.567 --> 01:04:27.449]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[01:04:27.909 --> 01:04:34.032]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[01:04:34.572 --> 01:04:35.092]  We're good to go.
[01:04:53.198 --> 01:04:53.919]  Hello, folks.
[01:04:53.939 --> 01:05:00.784]  This is Alex Jones introducing you to the incredible Berkey Solar Charger, your source for free solar electricity.
[01:05:01.025 --> 01:05:08.150]  This portable system is the size of a book when folded and small enough to fit into a briefcase, handbag, or glove compartment.
[01:05:08.270 --> 01:05:19.800]  The Berkey Solar Charger has been designed to power the Berkey lights, LED lamps, as well as other applications such as mobile phones, radios, digital cameras, and PDAs when electricity is unavailable.
[01:05:20.120 --> 01:05:20.921]  We're good to go.
[01:05:49.940 --> 01:05:49.960]  803-4438
[01:05:53.695 --> 01:05:58.596]  Did you know you could be punishing your diesel engine if you don't use a diesel fuel conditioner in the winter?
[01:05:58.956 --> 01:06:05.058]  Winter conditions don't just call for an anti-gel, but a host of additives, as diesels have trouble in the winter, especially when idling.
[01:06:05.638 --> 01:06:12.599]  SFR Diesel, with its multifunctional additive package, prevents soot buildup, maximizes performance, and improves mileage.
[01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:18.561]  If you want to run longer, run stronger, use SFR Diesel diesel fuel conditioner.
[01:06:18.921 --> 01:06:21.742]  Call 888-USE-SFR-1 for a store near you.
[01:06:24.130 --> 01:06:26.611]  Are your Federal Reserve notes looking for a safe haven?
[01:06:27.071 --> 01:06:28.991]  Mine found it in precious metals.
[01:06:29.692 --> 01:06:32.853]  Not paper promises, but actual gold in my possession.
[01:06:33.513 --> 01:06:39.995]  It is liquid, it is private, it owes no one, it cannot go bankrupt, and it maintains its purchasing power.
[01:06:40.755 --> 01:06:42.956]  Find your answer at Midas Resources.
[01:06:43.336 --> 01:06:43.576]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:06:43.596 --> 01:06:44.076]  The answer is at 1-800-686-2237.
[01:06:53.819 --> 01:06:55.980]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:06:56.560 --> 01:06:59.421]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:13.926 --> 01:07:18.848]  For over a quarter century, he's been covering the secret of Bilderberg Group.
[01:07:20.129 --> 01:07:20.949]  He's Jim Tucker.
[01:07:21.784 --> 01:07:37.378]  He formerly, of course, wrote for some of the largest syndicated newspaper columns in the country, and then 25-plus years ago he went to work for the Spotlight, and then today he works for its reincarnation, that is, the American Free Press.
[01:07:39.140 --> 01:07:41.782]  Jim Tucker's Bilderberg Diary is very impressive.
[01:07:41.802 --> 01:07:48.148]  You know, I scanned through this book before I decided to carry it, but on the exercise bike in the last month,
[01:07:48.829 --> 01:07:49.510]  I think we're good to go.
[01:08:11.098 --> 01:08:13.660]  So we carry it here at Infowars.com.
[01:08:13.680 --> 01:08:15.541]  We carry it as part of the video and bookstore.
[01:08:15.581 --> 01:08:19.643]  And I thought, I've got to get Jim back on before he goes to Bilderberg Group again this year.
[01:08:19.683 --> 01:08:23.665]  And he's back on the track.
[01:08:23.705 --> 01:08:27.448]  He's leading the pack in the search for Bilderberg.
[01:08:27.488 --> 01:08:29.709]  Sometimes he learns just a few days before.
[01:08:31.149 --> 01:08:33.911]  And boy, that's expensive to buy tickets to Europe when you learned a few days before.
[01:08:33.971 --> 01:08:39.396]  I'm trying to learn about it this year so I can get them like a couple weeks before because I'm not going to pay $10,000 for plane tickets.
[01:08:39.436 --> 01:08:41.057]  Sometimes they're really expensive.
[01:08:43.679 --> 01:08:48.363]  Oh yeah, tickets like $500 to Europe, $600 round trip unless you buy it a week or two before.
[01:08:48.383 --> 01:08:49.064]  Wow!
[01:08:52.328 --> 01:09:06.871]  I mean, imagine, for 20 plus years, sneaking through drainage ditches, climbing over hedges, being arrested, being detained, being kidnapped, basically, year after year, finding bugs hidden in his office, bugs hidden in his hotel room, excuse me.
[01:09:07.411 --> 01:09:09.092]  It's just such an amazing book.
[01:09:09.192 --> 01:09:16.713]  And to read all the news articles and clips he's got, making fun of it 10 years ago, 20 years ago, oh, it doesn't exist, nuts believe in it.
[01:09:16.973 --> 01:09:17.954]  They've gone from that.
[01:09:18.294 --> 01:09:19.974]  Major newspapers that attend it,
[01:09:20.600 --> 01:09:25.007]  Whose editors attended saying it didn't exist, and then he's got photos of them attending.
[01:09:25.748 --> 01:09:27.731]  And then he gets the minutes out of the meetings.
[01:09:28.151 --> 01:09:32.277]  He finds out a year before how the Berlin Wall is going to fall, how it's going to be staged.
[01:09:32.778 --> 01:09:34.461]  He finds out they're not going to invade in March of 2002.
[01:09:34.561 --> 01:09:35.983]  They're going to invade in March of 2003, Iraq.
[01:09:37.937 --> 01:09:39.900]  Kissinger says oil is going to explode in prices.
[01:09:39.980 --> 01:09:40.461]  It does.
[01:09:40.561 --> 01:09:53.540]  I mean, they really are running things because the moles he's got inside the meetings, the employees of these five-star hotels and resorts, at first they won't help him, but they treat people so bad that they realize they're so evil when they hear all this being discussed that they leak it.
[01:09:54.671 --> 01:10:03.333]  And so he joins us now for this hour, and I'm so honored to have him with us for the next 50 minutes or so, Jim Tucker, and it's so great to carry his book.
[01:10:03.653 --> 01:10:13.435]  Seriously, this is a great read, and it's an easy read because it's a great coffee book, coffee table book or bathroom book, book around the office.
[01:10:13.515 --> 01:10:15.736]  It's just so well done.
[01:10:17.076 --> 01:10:21.657]  Over a quarter century of dedication and devotion and love of country and sovereignty,
[01:10:22.370 --> 01:10:24.512]  You have me blushing like a schoolgirl.
[01:10:24.592 --> 01:10:25.894]  I appreciate it.
[01:10:26.154 --> 01:10:27.255]  It's a lot of fun writing it.
[01:10:43.914 --> 01:11:02.804]  Jim, I know that you don't have any feelers, or the lines you've got out there haven't gotten triggered on exactly where Bilderberg is going to be this year, but give us any ideas you've got, and then for those that don't know, why is Bilderberg important, and kind of tell us what their agenda is and what they're up to.
[01:11:03.585 --> 01:11:12.149]  Well, we haven't located them yet, and sometimes it gets to be very brinksmanship, and I stay nervous as a strumpet in church until we do nail them.
[01:11:13.012 --> 01:11:22.296]  And as you said, times would be even the two or three days before we get the final identification of the turkeys.
[01:11:23.057 --> 01:11:27.619]  And yes, they are a powerful group of international gangsters.
[01:11:28.059 --> 01:11:39.204]  Kissingers, Rothschilds, heads of state from Europe, high officials of the government of the United States, sometimes a few selected members of Congress if they're potential presidents.
[01:11:40.425 --> 01:11:40.545]  And
[01:11:41.533 --> 01:11:50.275]  Well, you've reeled off a lot of the stuff we've already had in the way of advanced stories on the end of the Cold War and that sort of thing that originated with Bilderberg.
[01:11:51.235 --> 01:11:59.657]  In fact, I remember doing it after a Bilderberg meeting quite some years ago, but they were very angry at Lady Thatcher.
[01:12:00.417 --> 01:12:07.818]  She had attended one meeting, had very little to say, didn't like them, and that was when she was Prime Minister.
[01:12:09.319 --> 01:12:09.419]  And
[01:12:11.869 --> 01:12:15.091]  They denounced her at that Bilderberg meeting, saying that she's got to go.
[01:12:15.191 --> 01:12:25.436]  She resists the Euro and other surrendering further sovereignty of Britain to the European Union.
[01:12:26.076 --> 01:12:28.217]  And that was just a horrible crime in their view.
[01:12:29.058 --> 01:12:35.341]  And so we wrote the story that the Bilderberg plans to bring down Lady Thatcher.
[01:12:36.021 --> 01:12:41.304]  Well, she's not called Lady Thatcher then, but to bring down the Prime Minister Thatcher.
[01:12:42.869 --> 01:12:47.373]  Which they did, replacing her with a trapeze artist from her own party, John Major.
[01:12:48.694 --> 01:12:59.441]  And I had the opportunity to chat with Lady Thatcher a few years later at a reception in Washington and ask her response to being denounced by Bilderberg.
[01:12:59.521 --> 01:13:02.484]  And she said she considered a tribute.
[01:13:02.604 --> 01:13:03.825]  She used the word tribute.
[01:13:04.425 --> 01:13:09.789]  And then explained that any head of state who has surrendered sovereignty to an international organization
[01:13:10.310 --> 01:13:11.451]  It's just doing a terrible thing.
[01:13:11.471 --> 01:13:12.151]  It should never do it.
[01:13:12.551 --> 01:13:14.813]  Now, there's been some victories, Jim.
[01:13:14.873 --> 01:13:17.374]  I mean, the EU expansion was defeated last year.
[01:13:17.894 --> 01:13:23.077]  The Pan-American Union deal is stalled for several years.
[01:13:23.938 --> 01:13:31.802]  Are the globalists from the moles you've got, are the globalists starting to get nervous that their one-world government agenda is in trouble?
[01:13:33.063 --> 01:13:33.743]  Yes, they are.
[01:13:33.884 --> 01:13:37.886]  Years ago, they thought they'd have a direct UN tax and a...
[01:13:39.026 --> 01:13:39.106]  Yes.
[01:13:39.186 --> 01:13:40.547]  Now, there you have about 3,000...
[01:14:10.074 --> 01:14:19.779]  Big bankers and high officials and so forth, but they do announce their meeting, and of course they have closed meetings, but they talk to reporters after their closed meetings.
[01:14:19.799 --> 01:14:27.463]  Joan Vion, who's covered that, said that she found that the leadership of Davos and all other global meetings she goes to is Bilderberg.
[01:14:27.483 --> 01:14:33.586]  So Bilderberg literally chairs and runs all the other major implementation mechanisms.
[01:14:33.606 --> 01:14:36.888]  Yes, it transpires that Bilderberg trickles down.
[01:14:38.005 --> 01:14:39.246]  We've seen it so many times.
[01:14:39.266 --> 01:14:43.507]  So the policy is formulated there, and then the different organizations get their walking orders?
[01:14:43.847 --> 01:14:48.549]  Yes, there, and with the brother group, the Trilateral Commission, yes, they get their walking orders.
[01:14:50.790 --> 01:15:02.354]  Nobody believed it in, I think it was about 1990, the Bilderberg meeting, when they said that then-President George
[01:15:03.184 --> 01:15:11.066]  Bush, number 41, must break his famous pledge made in the 1988 debates with Democrat Dukakis.
[01:15:11.967 --> 01:15:13.647]  Read my lips, no new taxes.
[01:15:13.687 --> 01:15:15.908]  He was far the Taxpayer's Bill of Rights.
[01:15:15.928 --> 01:15:24.050]  I was very proud of him because Liberty Lobby had proposed the Taxpayer's Bill of Rights before the Congress about 1977, and it did become law.
[01:15:28.140 --> 01:15:42.529]  But then, after that very clear promise in the televised debates, that he would never raise taxes, in 1991, he buckled under pressure, increased taxes, and Bill Clinton was elected president in 1990.
[01:15:43.496 --> 01:15:43.916]  I need to.
[01:15:43.936 --> 01:15:44.776]  Well, that's the thing.
[01:15:44.796 --> 01:15:48.137]  I mean, you find out when wars are going to start.
[01:15:48.157 --> 01:15:49.638]  You find out what's going to happen with energy.
[01:15:49.678 --> 01:15:50.878]  You find out everything.
[01:15:51.218 --> 01:15:52.459]  I mean, there's no bones about it.
[01:15:52.499 --> 01:15:58.721]  They're running things from these elite meetings, and none more elite than the Bilderberg group.
[01:15:58.761 --> 01:16:02.982]  I mean, it's like in The Godfather when they're in there around the big table having the commission meeting.
[01:16:03.022 --> 01:16:04.422]  I mean, this is the commission.
[01:16:04.462 --> 01:16:06.803]  This is the global crime syndicate, is it not?
[01:16:06.823 --> 01:16:07.823]  Definitely.
[01:16:07.863 --> 01:16:08.484]  Most definitely.
[01:16:08.884 --> 01:16:10.004]  Now, I wanted to bring up your book.
[01:16:10.484 --> 01:16:12.985]  Every other page, you'll have a photo
[01:16:14.418 --> 01:16:17.099]  Where you're calmly at a D.C.
[01:16:17.139 --> 01:16:26.302]  party confronting someone, and there's a shot of you and Dick Cheney here, and Cheney's looking at you with pure hatred, and it says, who let this guy in?
[01:16:27.342 --> 01:16:33.164]  And it says that you brought up Bilderberg to him, and he said, quote, these are not supposed to be discussed.
[01:16:33.184 --> 01:16:35.005]  These are supposed to be confidential.
[01:16:35.672 --> 01:16:36.412]  Yes, it's a lot of fun.
[01:16:36.432 --> 01:16:39.814]  My favorite is when Henry Kissinger forgets his German accent.
[01:16:39.834 --> 01:16:42.755]  It was after a Bilderberg meeting some years ago at reception.
[01:16:42.795 --> 01:16:45.196]  Wearing my Bilderberg suit, which is a black stripe, you know.
[01:16:45.256 --> 01:16:48.037]  Just fainting quite cordially inside.
[01:17:04.986 --> 01:17:15.873]  Dr. Kissinger, at the Bilderberg meeting at such and such, naming the place, you said, quoting him, and what did that white-haired European say in response?
[01:17:16.513 --> 01:17:18.335]  And he looked at me with his eyes bulging.
[01:17:18.355 --> 01:17:20.336]  He said, that was a private meeting.
[01:17:20.636 --> 01:17:21.397]  Then he corrected himself.
[01:17:21.637 --> 01:17:23.278]  That was a private meeting.
[01:17:24.125 --> 01:17:26.006]  That was a private meeting, talker!
[01:17:26.026 --> 01:17:29.387]  His German accent is an affectation.
[01:17:29.427 --> 01:17:31.188]  He's been in this country since the age of 14.
[01:17:31.769 --> 01:17:36.351]  I'm told his brother speaks English in such a way you'd never guess he has a German heritage.
[01:17:37.771 --> 01:17:39.112]  Also, he's a pompous ass.
[01:17:40.072 --> 01:17:41.373]  He has the same Ph.D.
[01:17:41.553 --> 01:17:44.815]  in economics from the same snob out in the school as David Rockefeller.
[01:17:45.515 --> 01:17:49.537]  But David Rockefeller has always been Mr. Rockefeller, not Dr. Rockefeller.
[01:17:49.977 --> 01:17:52.158]  Henry Kissinger is always Dr. Kissinger.
[01:17:53.021 --> 01:17:54.122]  He's just a pompous ass.
[01:17:55.182 --> 01:17:57.704]  Boy, I get the idea you don't like Henry Kissinger.
[01:17:59.425 --> 01:18:01.887]  No, I never even disliked President Clinton.
[01:18:02.487 --> 01:18:04.468]  Contempt and hatred are not synonymous.
[01:18:04.788 --> 01:18:05.689]  I have contempt for him.
[01:18:05.729 --> 01:18:06.429]  I don't hate him.
[01:18:07.750 --> 01:18:08.631]  And why is that?
[01:18:08.671 --> 01:18:10.592]  Why do you dislike Lord Kissinger?
[01:18:12.493 --> 01:18:15.195]  Because he is David Rockefeller's valet.
[01:18:15.215 --> 01:18:22.159]  He's been a Bilderberg luminary since the Nixon years when he was president.
[01:18:22.620 --> 01:18:23.880]  National Security Advisor.
[01:18:24.740 --> 01:18:26.181]  And I think before that, I'm not sure.
[01:18:26.201 --> 01:18:29.622]  Yeah, he's a prime mover in slitting America's throat.
[01:18:30.342 --> 01:18:33.622]  Yes, well, their loyalty is to the future world government.
[01:18:34.423 --> 01:18:43.224]  In fact, the term nationalist, if a Bilderberg calls you a nationalist, that's just a horrible insult in Bilderberg's frame of reference.
[01:18:43.544 --> 01:18:47.325]  We'll be right back with Big Jim Tucker, the book, Jim Tucker's Bilderberg Diary.
[01:18:47.865 --> 01:18:48.686]  And we're carrying it.
[01:18:48.706 --> 01:18:49.566]  Be sure and get a copy.
[01:18:49.686 --> 01:18:50.386]  Lots more coming up.
[01:18:54.170 --> 01:18:57.052]  Are terrorist cells or prime terror targets located near you?
[01:18:57.413 --> 01:19:00.275]  Where are military bases and hazardous waste sites located?
[01:19:00.515 --> 01:19:06.720]  How do you find the best area for solar, average rainfall, fish contamination advisories, and major transportation routes?
[01:19:07.080 --> 01:19:14.406]  In the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA, you will find the information you want with over 50 interactive parameters that you control.
[01:19:14.586 --> 01:19:18.669]  Find everything from housing prices and taxes to brewing environmental catastrophes.

[01:19:54.048 --> 01:19:57.950]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt.
[01:19:58.171 --> 01:20:10.438]  But the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999, reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking 10.57% annual increase outpacing its previous 10 years.
[01:20:10.878 --> 01:20:11.278]  The U.S.
[01:20:11.318 --> 01:20:16.902]  economy receives its currency by taking on debt through a private banking institution called the Federal Reserve System.
[01:20:17.302 --> 01:20:19.503]  In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%.
[01:20:21.364 --> 01:20:21.824]  We're good to go.
[01:20:42.054 --> 01:20:43.856]  Do you know the truth about breast cancer?
[01:20:43.956 --> 01:20:45.818]  Did you know that the race for the cure is over?
[01:21:01.380 --> 01:21:09.272]  The best kept secret in the country today is that it is now possible to kill cancer without personal suffering, mutilation, and poisoning of your entire system.
[01:21:09.492 --> 01:21:12.136]  Now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaysMed Inc.'
[01:21:12.116 --> 01:21:13.538]  's patented methodology.

[01:21:53.746 --> 01:22:02.370]  David J. Smith, did you know that a plan was laid down in the 1870s to conquer the world for world government that has not been deviated from since its inception?
[01:22:03.190 --> 01:22:08.133]  These conspirators said that they must have many revolutionary wars and three world wars.
[01:22:08.873 --> 01:22:13.535]  Have we witnessed these wars of liberation since the 1920s and then World War I and World War II?
[01:22:15.556 --> 01:22:24.081]  The Illuminati, who are worshippers of Lucifer, are now preparing for the final conflict, the Third World War, to produce their one world government.

[01:22:54.537 --> 01:23:11.387]  I'm looking at a photo here of Jim Tucker confronting President Gerald Ford in a 1991 Washington Press Club luncheon
[01:23:12.469 --> 01:23:17.233]  And one of his handlers is looking like he's about to physically attack Jim Tucker.
[01:23:17.253 --> 01:23:29.304]  You ought to see the video from that British TV documentary I was part of, The Secret Rulers of the World, where they're being chased by guys in dark sunglasses, and they grab Jim and drag him off and interrogate him, and they've done it over and over again.
[01:23:29.344 --> 01:23:30.425]  It's all part of the freedom.
[01:23:31.226 --> 01:23:37.792]  You can be miles away from their lordships, and you're just not even allowed to, because they're the lords and you're the slaves.
[01:23:39.324 --> 01:23:48.069]  Jim, what about this photo here from your Bilderberg diary book where you're talking to Gerald Ford and he brought up Bilderberg and he couldn't even form sentences and began stumbling?
[01:23:48.409 --> 01:23:49.550]  What page are we on there?
[01:23:51.071 --> 01:23:53.893]  That is at the start of Chapter 6.
[01:23:55.638 --> 01:23:56.999]  I guess it's page 46.
[01:23:57.059 --> 01:23:58.679]  Page 46.
[01:24:00.020 --> 01:24:08.744]  President Gerald Ford attended a Bilderberg meeting when he was House Majority Leader when I questioned Ford in 1991 about his particulars of that meeting, fumbling over his words.
[01:24:08.784 --> 01:24:14.146]  Pardon me, I really don't... Before he could finish his statement, he was whisked off by his entourage.
[01:24:14.186 --> 01:24:18.428]  As you may remember, Ford was well known for stumbling over his words and his own feet.
[01:24:18.848 --> 01:24:22.029]  Well, he was surprised that such a word would be uttered.
[01:24:24.656 --> 01:24:26.857]  Yes, he was surprised.
[01:24:26.877 --> 01:24:28.598]  It never was particularly articulate.
[01:24:28.638 --> 01:24:39.322]  Well, I mean, all their faces in these photos, where you'd have somebody snap a shot when you asked them a question, is deer in the headlights are like you just called their mother an expletive.
[01:24:39.362 --> 01:24:40.823]  I mean, it was shocked anger.
[01:24:42.563 --> 01:24:45.765]  Yes, sometimes you get the best information when you take it by surprise.
[01:24:45.845 --> 01:24:54.068]  One of my favorites was, what's his name, the Perennial Bilderberg from England.
[01:24:56.684 --> 01:24:57.364]  Dennis Healy?
[01:24:57.404 --> 01:24:57.965]  Lord Healy?
[01:24:58.946 --> 01:25:02.769]  No, the one who had been Chancellor's exchequer at one time.
[01:25:02.789 --> 01:25:04.009]  Oh, I know who you're talking about.
[01:25:04.049 --> 01:25:04.750]  Yeah.
[01:25:05.751 --> 01:25:14.658]  Well, some years ago, when we found out quite early where Bilderberg would be, he's having an informal meeting.
[01:25:14.698 --> 01:25:21.203]  He thought it would be a sweetheart meeting with about five reporters at the National Press Club in Washington.
[01:25:21.223 --> 01:25:23.124]  I happen to be one of them.
[01:25:24.245 --> 01:25:24.625]  And so...
[01:25:26.480 --> 01:25:31.024]  He said, you will be attending the Bilderberg meeting at, naming the spot location dates precisely.
[01:25:31.044 --> 01:25:34.267]  His mouth held up and said, could you tell us something about the agenda?
[01:25:35.087 --> 01:25:44.195]  Well, with the New York Times on one side and the Washington Post on the other, and two or three other guys from maybe Chicago or someplace, he felt compelled to answer.
[01:25:45.908 --> 01:25:47.168]  Now, until just a few years...
[01:26:14.013 --> 01:26:17.235]  The American Union has now expanded.
[01:26:17.275 --> 01:26:17.895]  Well, that's right.
[01:26:17.955 --> 01:26:22.738]  I mean, you were doing reports 25 years ago where they were planning the American Union global taxes.
[01:26:23.199 --> 01:26:28.322]  And some people say, well, that hasn't happened yet, even though they're almost succeeding and it's in the news.
[01:26:28.662 --> 01:26:30.543]  Well, it hadn't happened, so it doesn't exist.
[01:26:30.603 --> 01:26:31.303]  What do you mean?
[01:26:31.684 --> 01:26:32.744]  We're battling it.
[01:26:32.844 --> 01:26:35.346]  We're defeating part of it, not all of it.
[01:26:35.926 --> 01:26:42.010]  I mean, what do you say to those that are still in denial when it's publicly admitted now and the New York Times does report on Bilderberg now?
[01:26:42.810 --> 01:26:45.372]  Well, tell them to celebrate our victories.
[01:26:45.392 --> 01:26:52.757]  Now, NAFTA expansion in the free trade area of the Americas was supposed to happen rather quickly.
[01:26:52.777 --> 01:26:57.620]  I'm still seeing a guy's face and I don't remember his name in a moment.
[01:26:58.900 --> 01:27:07.806]  He predicted that within just a few years we'd have the American Union similar to the European Union.
[01:27:07.846 --> 01:27:11.168]  The dollar would be the euro and then there would be a third currency
[01:27:11.804 --> 01:27:11.904]  Yes.
[01:27:40.385 --> 01:27:42.627]  Are they using dollars as their own currency?
[01:27:45.569 --> 01:27:47.310]  Now, we should celebrate the victory calls.
[01:27:49.452 --> 01:28:02.461]  The letters to congressmen, the phone calls, other communications with congressmen, call some of them to become enlightened or scared of going into an SOS situation.
[01:28:03.323 --> 01:28:14.612]  Well, Jim, are you excited about the fact that now Bilderberg is becoming a well-known term, and are you excited about the fact that the EU expansion failed last year?
[01:28:15.092 --> 01:28:16.293]  Oh, yes, that's a victory.
[01:28:18.435 --> 01:28:33.046]  Of course, the New York Times did a feature story in which they tongue-in-cheek suggest they're an innocent bunch of virgin schoolboys type of thing, but the fact that they felt forced to account for the fact that there is a Bilderberg group at all is a breakthrough.
[01:28:34.529 --> 01:28:35.149]  Absolutely.
[01:28:35.689 --> 01:28:39.731]  I remember Reuters a few years ago said that they basically appoint presidents.
[01:28:39.751 --> 01:28:40.391]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:40.411 --> 01:28:40.811]  Stay with us.
[01:28:44.052 --> 01:28:44.953]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.433 --> 01:28:47.034]  The empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.954 --> 01:28:50.635]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:54.426 --> 01:28:55.027]  We're good to go.
[01:29:14.844 --> 01:29:15.324]  We're good to go.
[01:29:31.417 --> 01:29:32.077]  We're good to go.
[01:29:32.097 --> 01:29:32.277]  I think?
[01:29:56.107 --> 01:30:07.381]  Now you can enjoy the most delicious, freshest, and healthiest drinking water anytime, even while traveling, during outdoor sporting activities, and in hospital filtration environments such as local or national emergencies.
[01:30:07.601 --> 01:30:14.049]  The revolutionary Berkey Light removes pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, and harmful or unwanted chemicals.
[01:30:14.289 --> 01:30:20.115]  The Berkey Light is so powerful it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes, streams, and stagnant ponds.
[01:30:32.486 --> 01:30:39.413]  The Berkey light is transparent and glows in the dark with its rechargeable LED lighting system so it can be used as a night light or camp light.

[01:30:46.320 --> 01:30:47.501]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:30:55.350 --> 01:30:57.932]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here with an important question.
[01:30:58.092 --> 01:31:00.254]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[01:31:00.514 --> 01:31:10.623]  I mean the hard to find kind that's all natural and not full of corrosive toxins and chemicals and detergents that just dry out your skin and have been connected to very serious health problems?
[01:31:10.943 --> 01:31:13.265]  Let me tell you something about the Cal Bend Pure Soap Company.

[01:31:59.465 --> 01:32:01.206]  Jim in Texas.
[01:32:01.286 --> 01:32:01.806]  A.U.
[01:32:01.886 --> 01:32:03.266]  in Ohio.
[01:32:03.346 --> 01:32:03.826]  A.M.
[01:32:03.926 --> 01:32:05.927]  in New York.
[01:32:06.047 --> 01:32:06.727]  Alex, Connecticut.
[01:32:07.587 --> 01:32:09.047]  Daryl in Omaha, Nebraska.
[01:32:10.088 --> 01:32:11.788]  Your calls are coming up.
[01:32:11.828 --> 01:32:13.408]  Jim Tucker is our guest.
[01:32:13.469 --> 01:32:17.129]  And really, I guess whatever issue you bring up, it has to do with the Bilderberg Group.
[01:32:17.169 --> 01:32:18.150]  I mean, this is the elite.
[01:32:18.190 --> 01:32:22.011]  This is the Dutch royalty, the British royalty, the Rothschilds, the Rockefellers.
[01:32:22.151 --> 01:32:24.471]  And they get in there and they openly call for world government.
[01:32:25.071 --> 01:32:27.812]  And Jim Tucker has gotten, he'll tell you, stolen.
[01:32:28.867 --> 01:32:29.228]  I think.
[01:32:29.248 --> 01:32:29.408]  I think.
[01:32:49.562 --> 01:32:54.183]  That they're very upset about, quote, patriots and people in the U.S.
[01:32:54.243 --> 01:32:57.804]  exposing their New World Order and wanted to, quote, counter them in the media.
[01:32:57.844 --> 01:33:08.426]  And then I saw Rumsfeld and the Harvard newspaper and all these places saying the same thing months after as if they'd gotten their walking orders admitting that we're starting to clobber them.
[01:33:08.466 --> 01:33:14.968]  Did you hear that from any of your moles or witnesses or is that just from Echelon sources?
[01:33:17.021 --> 01:33:21.184]  Yes, I've heard that a number of times in a number of ways over the years and written about it.
[01:33:21.244 --> 01:33:24.307]  Now, Daniel Eschelon is a very good reporter.
[01:33:24.667 --> 01:33:26.048]  He's got his own book coming out.
[01:33:27.069 --> 01:33:31.972]  Well, he's been published his own Bilderberg book, much more scholarly than mine.
[01:33:32.012 --> 01:33:36.135]  It will not be an easy read, but it will be a tedious but thorough read.
[01:33:37.777 --> 01:33:45.222]  It's been published in two or three languages in Europe.
[01:33:45.820 --> 01:33:53.466]  And I understand it's coming to the United States in the fullness of time, and will also be available to our readers.
[01:33:54.607 --> 01:33:57.790]  Yes, he's a good reporter, and we've matched a lot of our same information.
[01:33:58.471 --> 01:34:06.858]  And many times I've heard and seen and learned that Bilderbergs are very concerned about nationalism in the United States.
[01:34:07.018 --> 01:34:10.441]  Petty provincial nationalism, they call it.
[01:34:13.106 --> 01:34:17.569]  Patriotic right-wingers have been announced.
[01:34:18.309 --> 01:34:24.933]  You're supposed to revere the UN flag far above Old Glory, if you're going to be a good Bilderberg boy.
[01:34:26.154 --> 01:34:27.015]  Jim, I don't mind it.
[01:34:27.035 --> 01:34:34.359]  I think it adds to the ambiance of this interview, but it sounds like a cross between a daily call to prayers and an air raid siren.
[01:34:34.379 --> 01:34:35.400]  Are you under attack there?
[01:34:37.613 --> 01:34:38.354]  Some kind of machine.
[01:34:38.794 --> 01:34:40.476]  Oh, there's some repairs going on here, I believe.
[01:34:40.956 --> 01:34:41.437]  Oh, okay.
[01:34:42.157 --> 01:34:45.040]  It sounds like... Yeah, I can hear it now, too.
[01:34:45.060 --> 01:34:46.421]  Oh, it doesn't bother me.
[01:34:46.441 --> 01:34:48.422]  I just figured the listeners would want to know what that was.
[01:34:49.763 --> 01:34:50.844]  I do believe it's harmless.
[01:34:51.365 --> 01:34:52.045]  Oh, I'm sure it is.
[01:34:52.085 --> 01:34:52.686]  I was joking.
[01:34:53.487 --> 01:34:58.290]  What I love is an old freight train going by in the background.
[01:34:59.732 --> 01:35:02.334]  Well, the old train whistles we used to hear late at night when...
[01:35:03.875 --> 01:35:06.196]  We had the smokestack trains.
[01:35:06.596 --> 01:35:07.277]  Yeah, those are neat.
[01:35:07.297 --> 01:35:08.178]  They had the old whistles.
[01:35:08.858 --> 01:35:17.744]  I want to take some calls, and they'll be all over the map, but are you getting any inkling of where the meeting is going to be this year, or where would it customarily be?
[01:35:17.784 --> 01:35:22.588]  Because it kind of has a meandering path, a semi-schedule around the world, doesn't it?
[01:35:22.608 --> 01:35:29.152]  Well, it's about North America's turn, typically three years in Europe and one year in North America.
[01:35:29.172 --> 01:35:31.354]  Now, that could be anywhere in Canada or the United States.
[01:35:33.931 --> 01:35:36.514]  As they have met before the last time in Chantilly.
[01:35:36.534 --> 01:35:39.456]  I think that was 2001 or 2002.
[01:35:39.497 --> 01:35:41.699]  That's out in Virginia, right?
[01:35:41.719 --> 01:35:43.520]  Yeah, well, near Dulles Airport.
[01:35:44.321 --> 01:35:45.602]  Yeah, right after the 9-11.
[01:35:47.264 --> 01:35:51.628]  And those guys were a little bit scared of being blown up.
[01:35:51.688 --> 01:35:54.131]  So straight to Dulles, which is only...
[01:35:55.144 --> 01:35:58.506]  Yeah, but still, so they could take a short helicopter ride.
[01:35:58.526 --> 01:35:59.907]  Well, a lot of them will ride in helicopters.
[01:35:59.927 --> 01:36:03.769]  Some of the more pompous prefer the limousines with police escorts and sirens blazing and flags flying.
[01:36:03.789 --> 01:36:04.849]  Those are ego riders.
[01:36:26.502 --> 01:36:34.124]  But we have some indications of North America, but we have a long way to go to pin down the site, and we could be wrong about that.
[01:36:35.384 --> 01:36:38.845]  Yeah, sometimes they skip it, don't they, and like do four years in Europe.
[01:36:40.105 --> 01:36:45.006]  Yeah, it's not precise, but generally it's typically three years Europe, one year North America.
[01:36:45.026 --> 01:36:50.928]  So there's a good chance I'll be able to go this year, because if it's in Europe and I get another heads up, Jim, I'm going to go.
[01:36:51.716 --> 01:36:54.737]  It'll be my virgin maiden voyage.
[01:36:55.957 --> 01:36:57.358]  And I hope to hang out with you some.
[01:36:57.498 --> 01:36:58.378]  Oh, yes.
[01:36:58.838 --> 01:36:59.878]  And to help you cover things.
[01:36:59.958 --> 01:37:01.199]  I'm pretty good at sneaking around.
[01:37:01.879 --> 01:37:04.600]  And maybe I'll get arrested by secret police like you do every year now.
[01:37:05.520 --> 01:37:06.940]  Well, not every year, but some years.
[01:37:07.100 --> 01:37:07.960]  Well, I mean, lately.
[01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:10.701]  Isn't it every year now you're getting detained or taken away for questioning?
[01:37:11.641 --> 01:37:16.783]  Oh, that was just in Italy a couple years ago as far as actually being detained by police for a number of hours.
[01:37:17.243 --> 01:37:18.523]  I was never in a cell or anything.
[01:37:18.563 --> 01:37:19.804]  I was just in an interview room.
[01:37:21.775 --> 01:37:23.796]  But every year there's a police confrontation.
[01:37:23.816 --> 01:37:30.239]  Yeah, well, reading your book, there's all these photos of journalists being packed in vans to be taken away.
[01:37:30.259 --> 01:37:34.522]  And didn't they grab you in Scotland, too?
[01:37:35.722 --> 01:37:37.763]  They tried to, but I was not as fat.
[01:37:37.823 --> 01:37:40.545]  Then I outran them.
[01:37:40.645 --> 01:37:40.945]  Okay.
[01:37:40.965 --> 01:37:43.807]  Not as fat, you outran them.
[01:37:44.387 --> 01:37:45.467]  You can run pretty fast.
[01:37:45.527 --> 01:37:46.828]  Jim, you're something else.
[01:37:46.868 --> 01:37:48.189]  If I ran faster than you, I could.
[01:37:50.762 --> 01:37:51.262]  I tell you.
[01:37:51.602 --> 01:37:53.784]  But any ballpark idea where it'll be in the U.S.?
[01:37:53.804 --> 01:37:54.464]  Just no telling.
[01:37:55.305 --> 01:37:55.965]  No telling yet.
[01:37:56.206 --> 01:37:57.527]  Could be in Canada, as you said.
[01:37:57.547 --> 01:37:58.567]  It could be Canada, yeah.
[01:37:59.388 --> 01:38:02.110]  Well, I'll definitely go, even if it's a few days' notice.
[01:38:02.770 --> 01:38:08.655]  If it's in... Well, on international flights, you can go to a travel agency and say, I'll...
[01:38:10.115 --> 01:38:21.237]  I'll pay the ticket right now with a certified checker, give you cash, but I want the cheap coach trip and still get it for about $500 to Paris, from Dulles to Paris to Dulles.
[01:38:21.257 --> 01:38:30.479]  See, I must be ignorant because I tried all the Expedias and all those and tried calling and they're like, that'll be $10,000 on the four days notice in coach.
[01:38:31.859 --> 01:38:36.160]  It's preferable to be 30 days in advance and say, here's the money.
[01:38:37.541 --> 01:38:39.663]  So that's the key, call a travel agent.
[01:38:39.843 --> 01:38:45.349]  Now, if on these cheap fares, if you don't make that flight, you have to apply it.
[01:38:45.589 --> 01:38:49.333]  The only way you can get another ticket is to apply it to a full fare thing.
[01:38:49.634 --> 01:38:50.855]  So you've got to make that flight.
[01:38:52.285 --> 01:38:55.127]  Jim, I know you're a very busy man, but will you do me a great favor?
[01:38:55.227 --> 01:38:55.427]  Sure.
[01:38:55.607 --> 01:39:03.091]  As soon as you hear about Bilderberg, and as soon as you learn the location, will you give me a ring and let me know?
[01:39:03.111 --> 01:39:11.555]  Because I know it might be two days before, and then boom, I just hear Jim's off to the races, and I don't want to be accosting you with phone calls, but I know you're the guy that usually learns first.
[01:39:11.976 --> 01:39:14.837]  Well, as soon as we know, they'll put it on the website.
[01:39:16.258 --> 01:39:16.418]  Ah, okay.
[01:39:17.543 --> 01:39:18.023]  Exactly.
[01:39:18.043 --> 01:39:23.526]  So listeners, help me watch that, because I'll end up not visiting the site for two days, AmericanFreePress.net, and then I'll miss it.
[01:39:24.486 --> 01:39:26.707]  Jim, I want to ask you a few other questions, and then go to some calls.
[01:39:26.827 --> 01:39:34.650]  In the book, there's so many other people that you're here confronting, and so many photos you and others have taken of David Rockefeller and all these other elitists.
[01:39:35.010 --> 01:39:39.312]  And in most of the pictures, they look so angry that you're taking their photos.
[01:39:39.992 --> 01:39:44.274]  They like spying on us and running our lives, but they don't like being surveilled by us, do they?
[01:39:44.994 --> 01:39:46.995]  Yes, they get very grim when the issue comes up.
[01:39:47.335 --> 01:39:48.716]  Incidentally, I didn't take the photographs.
[01:39:48.776 --> 01:39:50.977]  I'm not that good, but other good guys did.
[01:39:51.057 --> 01:39:56.239]  Christopher Boleyn shot many of them, and different people.
[01:39:56.259 --> 01:39:59.500]  We'd hire photographers that we'd seen sometimes.
[01:40:02.761 --> 01:40:06.603]  As a photographer, I'd make a very good bartender.
[01:40:06.923 --> 01:40:09.484]  These guys really are high-tech types.
[01:40:10.206 --> 01:40:11.967]  I do take photographs, very clear.
[01:40:11.987 --> 01:40:13.768]  Yeah, there's a lot of photos in here.
[01:40:13.788 --> 01:40:16.450]  What about this one where you're shaking hands with Newt Gingrich?
[01:40:16.490 --> 01:40:17.150]  What do you think of him?
[01:40:17.870 --> 01:40:18.931]  Well, interesting.
[01:40:19.051 --> 01:40:27.016]  Now, I'd never known him to attend a Bilderberg meeting, and he said he never had and never would, and he said I'm not that important.
[01:40:27.476 --> 01:40:29.317]  Now, that was when he was Speaker of the House.
[01:40:31.238 --> 01:40:38.042]  I've got... Some things I like in his contract with America, if the Republicans had ever carried it out, would leave us today with a...
[01:40:38.553 --> 01:40:44.698]  Yeah, and he's also something of a futurist who does see, from what I've read about him,
[01:41:07.452 --> 01:41:08.693]  A world type of government.
[01:41:08.913 --> 01:41:09.954]  Oh, yeah, that's why they love him.
[01:41:10.234 --> 01:41:12.255]  He's a good conservative one-worlder, though.
[01:41:12.476 --> 01:41:13.957]  Here's one, Richard Foley.
[01:41:15.474 --> 01:41:20.817]  Excuse me, Tom Foley attended both trilateral and Bilderberg meetings, and when you talk to him, there's a photo of this.
[01:41:21.177 --> 01:41:30.523]  It says, people shouldn't know about Bilderberg or the trilateral commission he fumed as he got a similar remedial civics lesson like that given to Dick Cheney in 1991.
[01:41:31.003 --> 01:41:34.145]  I mean, these guys really are just open elitists.
[01:41:34.165 --> 01:41:37.427]  They think that we're not supposed to know anything about them running our lives.
[01:41:38.127 --> 01:41:42.130]  Yes, and they're American officials breaking law every time they do it.
[01:41:43.117 --> 01:41:58.050]  It is against federal law, Congress' own law, for public officials to conduct not just foreign policy, but any doing public business behind closed doors with civilians.
[01:41:58.130 --> 01:41:59.951]  Now, they can meet privately among themselves.
[01:42:00.031 --> 01:42:10.240]  Obviously, any president can meet with his security counsel and discuss some intending crisis in the world, and it be a closed meeting.
[01:42:11.168 --> 01:42:18.810]  But once they bring in a civilian, no matter what kind of expert he is, that's against the law for the meeting to be closed.
[01:42:19.031 --> 01:42:26.873]  Well, yeah, they're meeting in really official capacities in these smoky rooms, the old classic back room, hammering out global policy.
[01:42:27.353 --> 01:42:32.775]  Yes, now the Bilderberg boys pay for their lodging and for their meals and their bar tests.
[01:42:32.835 --> 01:42:36.656]  The security is paid for by... Well, actually...
[01:42:37.718 --> 01:42:38.619]  Those guys are so rich.
[01:42:39.400 --> 01:42:40.700]  Millions of dollars, petty cash.
[01:42:41.101 --> 01:42:45.164]  They will often reimburse the local government for all that extra uniformed police protection.
[01:42:45.184 --> 01:42:46.825]  They have their own huge platoons.
[01:42:46.865 --> 01:42:48.947]  And in fact, they even call the military out, don't they?
[01:42:49.347 --> 01:42:50.348]  In Europe, yeah.
[01:42:50.688 --> 01:42:52.189]  And they have national police in Germany.
[01:42:52.649 --> 01:42:54.691]  And they also bring out the military.
[01:42:55.291 --> 01:43:03.657]  And you've got to understand that they'll compensate, typically, the local city government for the police along the sidewalks.
[01:43:05.822 --> 01:43:07.343]  Helping with traffic, the extra police.
[01:43:07.383 --> 01:43:10.946]  They'll reimburse the local government for the cost of overtime and other expenses.
[01:43:11.686 --> 01:43:16.229]  But, again, millions of dollars would be petty cash to those sites.
[01:43:17.270 --> 01:43:18.971]  But, yes, the security is there every year.
[01:43:20.752 --> 01:43:21.653]  Tremendous security.
[01:43:21.993 --> 01:43:25.555]  More and more, it seems, they try to meet on islands right off the coast.
[01:43:25.855 --> 01:43:27.216]  That way, it's really hard to get to them.
[01:43:28.377 --> 01:43:34.361]  Sometimes, they'd meet on these islands, like somewhere...
[01:43:35.006 --> 01:43:38.088]  Two years ago, and also down and off Spain some years ago.
[01:43:38.108 --> 01:43:55.960]  But typically, it will also be a very snobby resort with high walls around it, 40 miles from the big city where you'll get off the airplane, and in a very small town.
[01:43:57.241 --> 01:44:02.884]  That's why the planet story in the local weekly newspaper in a small town about...
[01:44:06.332 --> 01:44:08.554]  How wonderful it is all these important people are meeting.
[01:44:09.955 --> 01:44:10.716]  Don't worry about it.
[01:44:10.756 --> 01:44:12.377]  Don't be frightened by all these.
[01:44:13.157 --> 01:44:14.519]  It's to reassure the natives.
[01:44:15.079 --> 01:44:29.671]  Last year, they hit a new low by simply planning in the local newspaper a story about a medical convention being held at the resort.
[01:44:30.231 --> 01:44:32.673]  And they had photographs of people
[01:44:34.153 --> 01:44:39.597]  People who are not Bilderbergs say these were leaders of the medical convention being held.
[01:44:39.797 --> 01:44:45.881]  So they even staged news reports to try to cover up... One last point here.
[01:44:46.182 --> 01:44:48.143]  This is on page 69 of your book.
[01:44:48.163 --> 01:44:50.264]  2001, Gothenburg, Sweden.
[01:44:50.445 --> 01:44:57.349]  That year, the Bilderberg security took the unusual step of erecting a massive steel fence around the entire meeting site, but you say that didn't work.
[01:44:59.011 --> 01:45:00.732]  No, that fence could be penetrated...
[01:45:01.645 --> 01:45:02.826]  I think we're good to go.
[01:45:20.475 --> 01:45:21.215]  You know what I love?
[01:45:22.155 --> 01:45:23.736]  On what page is this?
[01:45:23.756 --> 01:45:24.976]  It's a new chapter.
[01:45:25.296 --> 01:45:28.837]  On page 50, it's got you confronting Henry Kissinger.
[01:45:28.857 --> 01:45:32.658]  So this is a photo of the event where he slipped out of his fake German accent?
[01:45:32.918 --> 01:45:34.138]  Yeah.
[01:45:34.518 --> 01:45:35.939]  I tell you folks, you've got to get this book.
[01:45:35.979 --> 01:45:39.419]  Jim Tucker's Bilderberg Diary, American Free Press put it out.
[01:45:39.439 --> 01:45:41.540]  It's a really well done book.
[01:45:41.700 --> 01:45:46.461]  250 something pages full of documents and news articles in the index and photos.
[01:45:47.444 --> 01:45:49.764]  It is an easy read, a great read.
[01:45:50.205 --> 01:45:55.325]  Give it to your friends and family after you're done reading it and ask them, why hasn't this ever been big news?
[01:45:55.365 --> 01:45:56.426]  You'd think this would be important.
[01:45:56.466 --> 01:46:00.546]  I mean, if four or five big politicians meet for golf, it's in national news.
[01:46:00.606 --> 01:46:06.767]  Or imagine if 125 of the top Hollywood people met and had the military guarding them and were deciding the future of Hollywood.
[01:46:07.027 --> 01:46:08.208]  That'd be big, big news.
[01:46:08.268 --> 01:46:12.808]  But no, when this happens, you've got the heads of the media there and they're saying, oh, don't talk about it, don't engage in it.
[01:46:13.168 --> 01:46:15.889]  Now, she called earlier and I told her we'd go back to her later so she could finish up.
[01:46:16.009 --> 01:46:16.489]  I missed it.
[01:46:16.949 --> 01:46:18.951]  Kim in Texas was talking about the Patriot Act.
[01:46:18.971 --> 01:46:20.452]  I want to get Jim Tucker's take on that.
[01:46:20.932 --> 01:46:26.697]  Kim, you were saying that you saw Specter and others on C-SPAN bragging about how they rammed it through.
[01:46:26.717 --> 01:46:29.699]  And for those that don't know, it's not a restriction of the Patriot Act.
[01:46:29.739 --> 01:46:31.101]  It's a radical expansion.
[01:46:31.561 --> 01:46:34.743]  And obviously, Jim will tell you, the Bilderberg Group wants a police state.
[01:46:35.064 --> 01:46:36.165]  Kim, finish up your comment.
[01:46:36.645 --> 01:46:41.029]  I was saying that because they were having a hearing.
[01:46:41.749 --> 01:46:46.473]  And Specter said, let me take a minute to thank my fellow Republican sessions
[01:46:47.216 --> 01:46:52.321]  Well, the wonderful job he did, because Goldfein was trying to get something passed through.
[01:46:53.042 --> 01:47:03.572]  I mean, Feingold, I'm sorry, Senator Feingold was trying to pass something through, and Sessions put a stop to it, and he took a minute, and a minute on TV is a lot of time.
[01:47:04.873 --> 01:47:07.734]  He went through and he was saying, yeah, we got the Patriot Act.
[01:47:08.034 --> 01:47:10.075]  They were laughing so hard they could barely speak.
[01:47:10.415 --> 01:47:12.956]  Yeah, that's Congressman Sessions from Texas.
[01:47:13.396 --> 01:47:15.917]  No, no, this is the one from Georgia.
[01:47:16.177 --> 01:47:17.218]  No, in other sessions.
[01:47:17.458 --> 01:47:18.498]  Right, from Georgia.
[01:47:18.678 --> 01:47:20.179]  I believe that's his name, Sessions.
[01:47:21.492 --> 01:47:24.695]  Senator from Georgia, I can look it up.
[01:47:25.015 --> 01:47:26.376]  Well, I appreciate your call.
[01:47:27.537 --> 01:47:31.640]  Just the mindset of laughing, the mindset of giggling at us.
[01:47:31.660 --> 01:47:37.024]  Can you talk about any arrogance you've witnessed from the Bilderberg group?
[01:47:37.985 --> 01:47:39.266]  Well, they were born arrogant.
[01:47:39.326 --> 01:47:49.254]  For example, the staff just retained a feed-and-love Bilderberg at the resort.
[01:47:50.480 --> 01:48:01.742]  Understand they'll typically send the staff out a lot, and each staff member will trust the employee for two or more years with his or her own name card with the color showing staffer.
[01:48:02.143 --> 01:48:10.644]  They're told never to look a Bilderberg participant in the eye, and never speak to a Bilderberg participant unless he speaks to you first.
[01:48:10.844 --> 01:48:12.825]  So be very, very subservient.
[01:48:13.265 --> 01:48:15.405]  Yes, you have to curse it to them all the time.
[01:48:17.246 --> 01:48:18.526]  They do take themselves seriously.
[01:48:19.272 --> 01:48:19.692]  I do, too.
[01:48:20.492 --> 01:48:21.373]  Take them seriously.
[01:48:21.513 --> 01:48:24.113]  Oh, yeah, they're destroying this country and enslaving us, Jim.
[01:48:24.693 --> 01:48:27.514]  They want us to be basically on their global plantation.
[01:48:28.394 --> 01:48:28.894]  Absolutely.
[01:48:29.755 --> 01:48:31.115]  Let's take another call here.
[01:48:32.035 --> 01:48:35.036]  Let's talk to Dayu, I believe is how you pronounce it in Ohio.
[01:48:35.396 --> 01:48:36.576]  Hello.
[01:48:37.436 --> 01:48:39.197]  Praise be to God and peace to the world.
[01:48:39.217 --> 01:48:41.197]  This is Dawood, the Arabic of David.
[01:48:41.377 --> 01:48:45.018]  I'm a Muslim brother calling in to you, one of my Christians, my Christian brother, Alex.
[01:48:45.058 --> 01:48:47.479]  I just want to thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak to you.
[01:48:48.504 --> 01:48:54.086]  First of all, I want to say that this New World Order is real, and if people don't understand it, they need to understand it.
[01:48:54.127 --> 01:48:58.068]  I'll give you two personal examples of something that happened to me.
[01:48:58.088 --> 01:49:08.192]  A year after 9-11, there was a program on C-SPAN, and the question of the day was, Muslims, how do you feel since 9-11?
[01:49:08.432 --> 01:49:09.293]  Like, how did we feel?
[01:49:09.313 --> 01:49:10.233]  Did we feel free?
[01:49:10.293 --> 01:49:10.933]  That kind of thing.
[01:49:11.414 --> 01:49:12.334]  Well, I called then.
[01:49:12.805 --> 01:49:20.729]  And there was an individual on the program from CARE, which is an Islamic organization, the Council of American Islamic Relations, and I think this gentleman actually is a plant.
[01:49:21.049 --> 01:49:35.736]  But anyway, I expressed how there was so much harassment of Muslims in the United States, and this guy disagreed with me, and I also said there was no clear evidence to prove that Muslims did this attack, and the person from CARE said that the Muslims did the attack.
[01:49:37.085 --> 01:49:46.109]  Well, the globalists have a lot of different so-called Muslim groups as their lapdogs, and there are a lot of Arabs and Muslims occasionally that show up at Bilderberg.
[01:49:46.129 --> 01:49:47.609]  We'll get Jim's take on that.
[01:49:47.669 --> 01:49:48.270]  Stay there, sir.
[01:49:48.290 --> 01:49:50.110]  We'll come right back to you.
[01:49:50.151 --> 01:49:50.771]  Jim, stay with us.
[01:49:55.180 --> 01:49:58.022]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[01:49:58.282 --> 01:49:59.863]  Hello, my friends, Alex Jones here.
[01:50:00.203 --> 01:50:04.866]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law, 9-11, Rise of the Police State.
[01:50:05.206 --> 01:50:11.950]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[01:50:12.230 --> 01:50:12.970]  We're good to go.
[01:50:42.116 --> 01:50:44.801]  Or watch the film right now online at prisonplanet.tv.
[01:50:54.477 --> 01:51:00.700]  The illuminated Berkey base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[01:51:00.860 --> 01:51:07.003]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[01:51:07.303 --> 01:51:15.747]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[01:51:15.968 --> 01:51:22.991]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter, and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[01:51:23.311 --> 01:51:28.134]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[01:51:28.354 --> 01:51:33.738]  The Berkey base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[01:51:34.098 --> 01:51:37.180]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[01:51:37.501 --> 01:51:45.466]  Get the illuminated Berkey base for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:51:45.506 --> 01:51:46.086]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.

[01:52:54.005 --> 01:52:56.205]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:52:56.766 --> 01:52:59.627]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:01.427 --> 01:53:03.728]  Jim Tucker, Bilderberg Diary, American Free Press.
[01:53:03.788 --> 01:53:04.488]  We carry it.
[01:53:05.128 --> 01:53:06.349]  Twenty bucks at InfoWars.com.
[01:53:07.538 --> 01:53:11.300]  Don't forget you can see all the films online and a lot more right now at prisonplanet.tv.
[01:53:33.772 --> 01:53:34.993]  Diode in Ohio.
[01:53:35.013 --> 01:53:39.237]  Finish up what you were saying so I can get a comment from Jim Tucker before he leaves us.
[01:53:39.877 --> 01:53:41.299]  Yes, Alex, just one other thing, too.
[01:53:41.379 --> 01:53:53.930]  I wanted to ask him about incidents of how the Bilderbergs control things like C-SPAN and that kind of thing, because just to continue my comment, subsequent to my commentary on C-SPAN, you know how they put things up on their website?
[01:53:53.990 --> 01:53:57.573]  Well, it was up for a little while, and it was sanitized that same day, so...
[01:53:58.444 --> 01:54:04.029]  In actuality, they control C-SPAN, they control all these media efforts, and I would encourage everyone to continue to listen to your program.
[01:54:04.450 --> 01:54:05.331]  I have all of your tapes.
[01:54:05.871 --> 01:54:21.706]  I'm out there fighting this InfoWar, and for people to really get the real information about Muslims, I'd be curious to know what Muslims are involved in the Build-A-Burg, what so-called Muslims, I should say, because real Muslims, we know that we have brothers who are Christian, we have brothers who are Muslims,
[01:54:22.014 --> 01:54:22.074]  Yes.
[01:54:22.094 --> 01:54:24.416]  Well, there have been a few times over the years where...
[01:54:48.712 --> 01:54:56.915]  Israelis and Palestinian leaders were invited to Bilderberg meetings, ostensibly trying to work out a peace deal.
[01:54:57.696 --> 01:54:58.636]  They're not regulars.
[01:54:58.736 --> 01:55:05.299]  It's typically white Europeans and white North Americans who meet.
[01:55:05.559 --> 01:55:10.801]  But there are... Vernon Jordan is the exception.
[01:55:10.841 --> 01:55:14.682]  He's a high-powered lawyer who happens to be a Negro.
[01:55:14.762 --> 01:55:16.363]  He's a Bilderberg luminary.
[01:55:16.383 --> 01:55:17.263]  But most...
[01:55:19.153 --> 01:55:22.614]  Generally, it's a white man's club from Europe and North America.
[01:55:22.634 --> 01:55:28.495]  It's only been about twice that they've invited people from Palestine, leaders of Palestine.
[01:55:28.555 --> 01:55:31.036]  But there have been Saudi princes there, correct?
[01:55:31.096 --> 01:55:31.396]  Yes.
[01:55:33.436 --> 01:55:38.137]  Yes, I believe I remember some Saudis attending, but not on a regular basis.
[01:55:40.618 --> 01:55:41.558]  So that's the extent of it.
[01:55:42.168 --> 01:55:44.190]  The Bilderberg involvement that I'm aware of.
[01:55:44.370 --> 01:55:46.031]  All right, caller, I appreciate your call.
[01:55:46.071 --> 01:55:49.094]  I hope that answers your question.
[01:55:49.114 --> 01:55:53.197]  Ian, Alex, Daryl, and others, I'll try to get to you coming up in the next segment.
[01:55:53.217 --> 01:56:02.785]  Then we have a guest joining us to talk about the attack on free speech in this country and Christians being arrested and being persecuted for simply playing on street corners.
[01:56:03.485 --> 01:56:05.046]  Very, very dark times are upon us.
[01:56:05.367 --> 01:56:08.869]  Jim, Bilderberg is normally what, late April, early May?
[01:56:09.870 --> 01:56:09.930]  Uh...
[01:56:11.488 --> 01:56:15.331]  Most likely the last two weeks of May or the first two weeks of June.
[01:56:15.771 --> 01:56:17.492]  They have met as early as late April.
[01:56:17.512 --> 01:56:22.195]  I think it was last year they met the first weekend in May.
[01:56:22.815 --> 01:56:25.617]  They tend toward the last two weeks of May and the first two weeks of June.
[01:56:25.717 --> 01:56:31.461]  So it tends towards later May, early June, but sometimes it's late April, early May.
[01:56:32.742 --> 01:56:32.962]  Yes.
[01:56:33.102 --> 01:56:38.425]  There have been a few occasions over the last 54 years when it was actually late April.
[01:56:38.605 --> 01:56:40.747]  But you're not getting an inkling of where it could be?
[01:56:42.785 --> 01:56:49.053]  Just indications from some sources, North America, but that's as close as we've pinned it down so far.
[01:56:49.253 --> 01:56:50.194]  If we have pinned it down.
[01:56:50.234 --> 01:56:54.319]  Now, sometimes you learn weeks before or months before, but normally what do you learn just a few days before?
[01:56:55.140 --> 01:56:58.725]  Yes, well, it gets tougher every year because every year they go to greater lengths to...
[01:56:59.377 --> 01:56:59.677]  Yes.
[01:56:59.737 --> 01:57:00.999]  I'm happy to make them angry.
[01:57:01.019 --> 01:57:05.363]  On the other hand, it also makes it more difficult to grab them, especially in a timely way.
[01:57:22.589 --> 01:57:26.551]  Jim, you're a journalistic legend, a living legend.
[01:57:26.591 --> 01:57:27.672]  We thank you for joining us.
[01:57:27.892 --> 01:57:28.572]  It was my pleasure.
[01:57:28.612 --> 01:57:28.952]  Anytime.
[01:57:29.192 --> 01:57:29.593]  You bet.
[01:57:29.933 --> 01:57:32.054]  Folks, get his book, Bilderberg Diary.
[01:57:33.755 --> 01:57:38.577]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNlive.com or call toll free 877-300-7645.
[01:57:38.597 --> 01:57:38.837]  Hello, folks.
[01:57:50.416 --> 01:57:51.057]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.717 --> 01:57:52.757]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:53.477 --> 01:57:54.597]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:55.237 --> 01:57:56.078]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.818 --> 01:57:57.738]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:58.398 --> 01:58:02.019]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.559 --> 01:58:06.680]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:11.881 --> 01:58:14.181]  Now into the third and final hour.
[01:58:14.261 --> 01:58:17.342]  I'd say the last two hours exploded past us as usual.
[01:58:18.169 --> 01:58:24.933]  Repent America will be joining us, evangelists to stand trial for ministering on public sidewalk, federal lawsuit filed.
[01:58:25.693 --> 01:58:30.576]  Really serious attack on free speech across the board, liberal, conservative, Christian, whatever.
[01:58:31.216 --> 01:58:32.657]  Free speech is under attack.
[01:58:32.677 --> 01:58:40.841]  We'll be talking about that with our guest and recapping some of the things that are happening to Christians across America in the past and what's coming up.
[01:58:42.052 --> 01:58:45.154]  In the future, but this current issue, and of course your phone calls.
[01:58:45.194 --> 01:58:46.375]  Right now, let's go to your calls.
[01:58:46.875 --> 01:58:47.816]  Ian in New York.
[01:58:47.856 --> 01:58:48.496]  Thanks for holding.
[01:58:48.536 --> 01:58:48.856]  Welcome.
[01:58:48.876 --> 01:58:50.417]  How are you doing, Alex?
[01:58:50.657 --> 01:58:51.038]  Good, sir.
[01:58:52.559 --> 01:58:58.922]  Yeah, I go to college and I take an international relations class and I take a western civilization class.
[01:58:59.583 --> 01:59:02.725]  And, you know, I've been listening for a couple of years and researching and stuff.
[01:59:03.305 --> 01:59:08.028]  And, like, especially my international relations class, like, I stop sometimes the correct amount.
[01:59:08.755 --> 01:59:09.015]  Yeah, and...
[01:59:39.358 --> 01:59:43.881]  You know, I'm paying good money for my education, and here they're like not telling me.
[01:59:44.401 --> 01:59:46.262]  You're paying to be taught a false paradigm.
[01:59:46.683 --> 01:59:46.883]  Yeah.
[01:59:47.103 --> 01:59:51.365]  I believe in college for engineering or mathematics or scientific things you're going to need.
[01:59:51.666 --> 01:59:53.287]  I mean, that's really a true science.
[01:59:53.807 --> 02:00:05.014]  But so much of the stuff you're going to learn, you know, going to their schools of economics or going to their international affairs schools, it's just teaching you the mindset to go be a cog in a fraud.
[02:00:06.195 --> 02:00:06.355]  Yeah.
[02:00:07.355 --> 02:00:15.182]  But, yeah, that's what I wanted to mention to you, but keep up the good work, and I look forward to what you're going to come out with next.
[02:00:15.323 --> 02:00:18.265]  All right, I appreciate your call, sir, and I can tell you're frustrated.
[02:00:18.305 --> 02:00:20.628]  I'm not saying it's a waste of time and you're going to school.
[02:00:20.708 --> 02:00:24.331]  You'll learn how the enemy brainwashes people, and you'll pick up a lot while you're there.
[02:00:24.391 --> 02:00:25.793]  But, yeah, you bring anything up.
[02:00:25.893 --> 02:00:27.935]  Hey, the government wants to do something bad.
[02:00:28.135 --> 02:00:28.695]  Shut up!
[02:00:28.775 --> 02:00:29.596]  It doesn't exist.
[02:00:29.876 --> 02:00:32.419]  Government is pure as the driven snow and godlike.
[02:00:34.226 --> 02:00:35.927]  Government created the solar system.
[02:00:36.427 --> 02:00:37.608]  Government created the sun.
[02:00:37.668 --> 02:00:39.228]  Government breathed life into Adam.
[02:00:39.628 --> 02:00:40.069]  Government.
[02:00:40.289 --> 02:00:40.669]  Government.
[02:00:40.749 --> 02:00:41.149]  Government.
[02:00:41.449 --> 02:00:41.949]  Day one.
[02:00:41.989 --> 02:00:42.349]  Government.
[02:00:43.370 --> 02:00:45.051]  Let's talk to Alex in Connecticut.
[02:00:45.091 --> 02:00:45.771]  Alex, go ahead.
[02:00:45.791 --> 02:00:46.691]  Hi, Alex.
[02:00:46.711 --> 02:00:47.191]  How are you doing?
[02:00:47.592 --> 02:00:48.032]  Good, sir.
[02:00:48.972 --> 02:00:49.992]  Yeah, that's true.
[02:00:50.133 --> 02:00:53.614]  I was going to school, too, and I've been hearing stuff about that, too.
[02:00:54.537 --> 02:00:57.358]  You know, you're frustrated and you want to correct the teachers.
[02:00:57.498 --> 02:00:58.478]  Any criticism?
[02:00:58.738 --> 02:01:05.080]  Look, if the media was saying the earth was flat and you said it wasn't, they'd go, stop your extremism, code word for racism.
[02:01:05.900 --> 02:01:07.221]  Round earth is racist.
[02:01:07.761 --> 02:01:07.941]  Yeah.
[02:01:08.561 --> 02:01:10.182]  But I had a question.
[02:01:10.382 --> 02:01:15.303]  I was curious, this is actually for the last guest, but about the Bilderbergers.
[02:01:15.323 --> 02:01:17.224]  Sure, you can ask me in a little bit about it.
[02:01:17.424 --> 02:01:17.644]  Okay.
[02:01:18.985 --> 02:01:27.527]  Now, you know, I know I've watched your films and, you know, talking about how the Trial Auto Commission, they, you know, they control the media outlets and all that stuff.
[02:01:28.287 --> 02:01:37.329]  And, you know, I was watching BBC News on PBS and after the, you know, when the credits roll, it says, you know, the foundations are from the Bilderberg and Rockefeller.
[02:01:37.569 --> 02:01:44.351]  I know you take the news from BBC, but I just want to know, for me, how do I go about
[02:01:45.547 --> 02:01:47.712]  It's a very important question.
[02:01:47.732 --> 02:01:51.080]  You're saying, Alex, you say the media is controlled.
[02:01:52.683 --> 02:01:53.064]  Okay.
[02:01:53.084 --> 02:01:53.224]  Okay?
[02:01:53.244 --> 02:01:53.584]  Or like...
[02:02:17.447 --> 02:02:18.888]  And there's not just media lying.
[02:02:18.968 --> 02:02:20.009]  There's spin.
[02:02:20.429 --> 02:02:22.710]  There's lying by omission.
[02:02:23.070 --> 02:02:24.911]  There's different classes of media.
[02:02:25.571 --> 02:02:25.991]  You know what?
[02:02:26.031 --> 02:02:28.773]  I've got a guest coming up, but we'll get the guest on.
[02:02:28.793 --> 02:02:34.215]  But before I go to him, I'll spend a minute or two trying to break down different types of media with my own classification system.
[02:02:34.235 --> 02:02:37.877]  I mean, you can come up with a better classification if you want, but it's pretty basic.
[02:02:38.497 --> 02:02:40.498]  So stay there, and I'll try to explain this.
[02:02:40.518 --> 02:02:41.699]  Because it's an important question.
[02:02:42.039 --> 02:02:43.580]  It's an often asked question.
[02:02:46.289 --> 02:02:50.613]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:02:50.813 --> 02:02:54.957]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World War.
[02:02:57.790 --> 02:02:59.771]  This disaster is a new world order.
[02:02:59.851 --> 02:03:02.852]  A new world order can emerge.
[02:03:02.932 --> 02:03:07.135]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:03:07.215 --> 02:03:14.138]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:03:14.278 --> 02:03:16.279]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:03:16.519 --> 02:03:26.962]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:03:27.262 --> 02:03:32.623]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[02:03:46.167 --> 02:03:47.788]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:03:47.908 --> 02:03:52.029]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[02:03:52.149 --> 02:03:55.030]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[02:03:55.110 --> 02:04:01.812]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[02:04:02.012 --> 02:04:05.014]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[02:04:05.215 --> 02:04:07.596]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[02:04:07.756 --> 02:04:17.884]  Like murky elements, not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as actazine, benzene, chloride, and chloroform.
[02:04:18.344 --> 02:04:20.585]  Or order on the web at BerkeyWater.com.

[02:05:29.221 --> 02:05:34.722]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:05:34.742 --> 02:05:36.303]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:05:36.323 --> 02:05:38.263]  There's different types of propaganda media.
[02:05:59.674 --> 02:06:00.814]  We're good to go.
[02:06:00.834 --> 02:06:01.875]  We're good to go.
[02:06:21.900 --> 02:06:22.701]  But here's an example.
[02:06:22.741 --> 02:06:30.867]  The Associated Press, last week, when the Senate and House finally passed the expanded Patriot Act and sent it on to Bush to be signed...
[02:06:31.943 --> 02:06:39.488]  ...said that it was a victory for civil libertarians, that it had been restricted, that the Patriot Act had been reauthorized, but that it had some of the bad things taken out.
[02:06:40.168 --> 02:06:51.135]  All the bad things stayed, and radical, horrible national police forces were created, arrests for any reason, protesting anywhere, even if no protected, quote, official is there.
[02:06:51.155 --> 02:06:56.859]  You get a year and a half prison just if the national police force says you did something wrong, which is anything they deem...
[02:06:58.364 --> 02:07:00.586]  It just was filled with nightmarish stuff.
[02:07:00.627 --> 02:07:02.208]  It was radical expansion.
[02:07:03.169 --> 02:07:08.614]  And you could read the bill and read the analysis by constitutional scholars and congressmen and others that we interviewed and we wrote articles about it.
[02:07:08.974 --> 02:07:09.615]  Many others did.
[02:07:10.075 --> 02:07:11.497]  Clearly it was a radical expansion.
[02:07:11.617 --> 02:07:15.721]  AP spun it and said, oh, it's a victory for freedom lovers.
[02:07:17.347 --> 02:07:24.911]  Then there's this good old-fashioned brainwashing or recasting semantical word games where now they're recasting Big Brother.
[02:07:25.392 --> 02:07:28.353]  Big Brother isn't a big, oppressive, authoritarian state.
[02:07:28.653 --> 02:07:30.174]  Big Brother's keeping kids safe.
[02:07:30.234 --> 02:07:31.095]  Big Brother's helping.
[02:07:31.115 --> 02:07:32.796]  Big Brother's to the rescue.
[02:07:32.876 --> 02:07:34.777]  Big Brother steps in to save people.
[02:07:35.277 --> 02:07:37.739]  Every day I see multiple articles in the Western world.
[02:07:37.759 --> 02:07:38.379]  Big Brother's good.
[02:07:38.399 --> 02:07:38.959]  Big Brother helps.
[02:07:38.979 --> 02:07:39.600]  Big Brother's nice.
[02:07:39.820 --> 02:07:40.760]  Big Brother helps kids.
[02:07:40.800 --> 02:07:43.042]  Big Brother, Big Brother, Big Brother, Big Brother, Big Brother, Big Brother.
[02:07:43.202 --> 02:07:44.643]  Big Brother gets a dog back to owner.
[02:07:44.683 --> 02:07:45.323]  Big Brother, Big Brother.
[02:07:45.803 --> 02:07:47.484]  So you see that type of stuff going on.
[02:07:48.724 --> 02:07:57.068]  And then there's lying by omission, where they go, the Iranian president said that he would cause us great harm and discomfort.
[02:07:58.209 --> 02:08:08.313]  And then the full quote was, if you attack us, yes, I'm sure it will cause great discomfort, as you've said you will cause us, but we will cause it back.
[02:08:09.336 --> 02:08:13.240]  They were just repeating the quote of Mr. Bolton, the head U.N.
[02:08:13.361 --> 02:08:15.643]  envoy from the U.S., back to them.
[02:08:15.683 --> 02:08:17.164]  But see, they took it out of context.
[02:08:17.725 --> 02:08:19.567]  This is what they're masters at.
[02:08:19.627 --> 02:08:26.354]  And then you've got thousands of actual CIA officers and Department of Education and Department of Labor.
[02:08:26.854 --> 02:08:31.219]  Every major federal agency spends tens of millions, in some cases billions, a year.
[02:08:32.603 --> 02:08:37.486]  Just the White House, through two agencies, spent $1.6 billion in the last two years just through two agencies.
[02:08:37.506 --> 02:08:41.369]  That's only a small portion, the GAO reported, Governmental Accounting Office.
[02:08:41.389 --> 02:08:45.151]  And, of course, it's all illegal, but Bush says he's above the law and is going to do that.
[02:08:45.511 --> 02:08:52.276]  And so then they do have a lot of flat-out operatives who go, Saddam tried to buy nuclear weapons material, the yellow cake from Nigeria.
[02:08:52.316 --> 02:08:53.016]  Here's a document.
[02:08:53.116 --> 02:08:53.556]  It's fake.
[02:08:53.857 --> 02:08:54.357]  It's made up.
[02:08:55.442 --> 02:08:58.083]  Or our informant says they got WMDs.
[02:08:58.364 --> 02:09:01.905]  Not only is the government's thing a lie, their reporter is a government agent.
[02:09:02.446 --> 02:09:07.168]  Or Tommy Franks goes on TV and starts every little speech or thing he says with this.
[02:09:07.448 --> 02:09:08.689]  Now, I'm out of government now.
[02:09:08.709 --> 02:09:09.569]  I'm not with any party.
[02:09:09.609 --> 02:09:10.690]  I'm not paid to say this.
[02:09:10.970 --> 02:09:11.831]  He actually says that.
[02:09:12.091 --> 02:09:14.452]  Turned out he was getting paid $455,000 a year to lie for them.
[02:09:17.412 --> 02:09:26.151]  You've got good old-fashioned lying, and then you've got select people at the Washington Post, New York Times, CNN, Fox, who put out the story that everybody else regurgitates and parrots.
[02:09:26.191 --> 02:09:27.273]  They're not government agents.
[02:09:27.944 --> 02:09:28.384]  We're good to go.
[02:09:28.404 --> 02:09:28.544]  I think?
[02:09:57.789 --> 02:10:03.051]  And so there will be the same CBS newscast nationwide the same night on every major.
[02:10:03.411 --> 02:10:09.052]  A few might not do it because they got bumped for something else, but most of them, saying vaccines are the law.
[02:10:09.072 --> 02:10:10.453]  You must take them or you'll be arrested.
[02:10:10.833 --> 02:10:13.854]  And by the way, a new medical report says mercury is good for you.
[02:10:15.074 --> 02:10:21.416]  And we play those reports, and they said it nationwide, and it was written by the CIA at CBS Broadcast Center in Manhattan.
[02:10:22.376 --> 02:10:25.997]  Where, by the way, Fox, CBS...
[02:10:27.109 --> 02:10:29.350]  And what's the other one?
[02:10:29.830 --> 02:10:30.770]  It's three of the big ones.
[02:10:31.351 --> 02:10:33.912]  All nest together at the CBS Broadcast Center.
[02:10:34.672 --> 02:10:35.012]  What is it?
[02:10:35.472 --> 02:10:40.134]  NBC, Fox, CNN, and CBS.
[02:10:40.254 --> 02:10:40.894]  So it's four.
[02:10:42.295 --> 02:10:44.376]  I'm going to go to Mr. Mark Cavett in just a minute.
[02:10:44.416 --> 02:10:47.957]  You ask this question, and I'm going to try to give you the answer because it's an important question.
[02:10:48.397 --> 02:10:50.098]  Then you've got real news.
[02:10:52.668 --> 02:11:05.576]  Thousands and thousands of AP, Reuters, UPI, Knight Ritter, local news articles where the editor wasn't paying attention, and most big city editors are government agents in the intelligence agencies.
[02:11:05.896 --> 02:11:07.577]  I have documents from the 50s admitting that.
[02:11:07.958 --> 02:11:17.884]  But they miss it, or the editor's out playing golf or hanging out with his boyfriend, whatever he's doing, and so he misses it, and then it gets in, or it gets on the newswire.
[02:11:18.721 --> 02:11:25.283]  But if the establishment doesn't like it, it'll be on that newswire, but it'll never get in the paper or on the nightly news.
[02:11:26.504 --> 02:11:26.884]  Okay?
[02:11:26.944 --> 02:11:34.046]  It won't get the big traction of some Aruba kidnapping or Michael Jackson or the day's diversion.
[02:11:34.806 --> 02:11:35.227]  Okay?
[02:11:36.387 --> 02:11:41.469]  Like, it'll come out in BBC and Associated Press that Bush ordered the FBI not to stop Al Qaeda before 9-11.
[02:11:42.789 --> 02:11:46.350]  And it'll be on those newswires, but never on your nightly news.
[02:11:46.390 --> 02:11:47.891]  For the average person, it doesn't exist.
[02:11:47.911 --> 02:11:48.071]  So I...
[02:11:48.985 --> 02:11:50.726]  And there's other forms of media as well.
[02:11:50.786 --> 02:12:10.976]  What we do is we take the media, the information, the bills, legislation, the things that didn't get major traction or that was only on regional news, we break the regional news barriers, the gatekeepers, and we put it on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com as a nexus point or a crossroads where you get a clearer picture of what's going on.
[02:12:10.996 --> 02:12:11.336]  All right.
[02:12:13.137 --> 02:12:16.839]  I want to go to our guest who's with Repent America, and he does great work.
[02:12:17.139 --> 02:12:18.060]  I am against abortion.
[02:12:19.011 --> 02:12:26.337]  So many liberals out there think that because I'm anti-Bush that I follow other tenets of the Democratic Party.
[02:12:26.817 --> 02:12:28.158]  The Democratic Party is for the war.
[02:12:28.198 --> 02:12:29.059]  They're for the New World Order.
[02:12:29.079 --> 02:12:29.980]  They're bought and paid for.
[02:12:30.660 --> 02:12:36.245]  And people think it's a tenet or a sacrament of being a, quote, progressive or a liberal to be for abortion.
[02:12:36.445 --> 02:12:41.729]  And it's because you never had children or you've been involved in abortion and you can't admit to yourself what you've done.
[02:12:42.790 --> 02:12:44.351]  And it is murder.
[02:12:45.312 --> 02:12:46.253]  And it is horrible.
[02:12:46.393 --> 02:12:47.994]  And if you've done it, you can be forgiven.
[02:12:48.613 --> 02:12:49.714]  Okay, you can forgive yourself.
[02:12:49.734 --> 02:12:50.534]  God can forgive you.
[02:12:50.574 --> 02:12:55.697]  But hardening your heart and doing this is horrible.
[02:12:56.458 --> 02:12:59.460]  And our government gives China awards when they kill babies out of the womb.
[02:13:00.641 --> 02:13:04.343]  Tens of thousands of babies every year are killed outside the mother's womb here in this country.
[02:13:04.383 --> 02:13:05.924]  We can't even get rid of partial birth abortion.
[02:13:06.224 --> 02:13:08.045]  Even when there's a supposed ban, it still goes on.
[02:13:08.325 --> 02:13:12.488]  Bush is against one of the Dakotas banning most types of abortions.
[02:13:13.616 --> 02:13:15.098]  And, you know, it's sick.
[02:13:15.138 --> 02:13:24.006]  You can tune in and see that politically incorrect show he's got now, the Bill Maher Show on HBO, and he'll say all these things that are true about 9-11 or the bird flu being a hoax or the police state.
[02:13:24.326 --> 02:13:27.409]  But then he gets up there with Gloria Steinem looking like a pumpkin head.
[02:13:27.949 --> 02:13:29.591]  She admittedly was CIA, by the way.
[02:13:29.611 --> 02:13:31.592]  Founded Miss Magazine with CIA money.
[02:13:31.612 --> 02:13:36.697]  It was a front to get the women into the system and working and to break up the family so the state could raise the kids.
[02:13:36.737 --> 02:13:37.678]  That's a fact, by the way.
[02:13:38.368 --> 02:13:38.928]  That's public.
[02:13:39.509 --> 02:13:40.810]  And she was up there this weekend.
[02:13:40.830 --> 02:13:42.070]  I really watched TV and I turned it on.
[02:13:42.090 --> 02:13:44.732]  They were salivating talking about killing little babies.
[02:13:45.633 --> 02:13:52.097]  But anyways, Mr. Mark Cabbage will go out and they'll sit on a city street and pray at the Outfest in Philadelphia.
[02:13:52.117 --> 02:13:54.478]  They'll be arrested, face 47 years for hate speech.
[02:13:55.279 --> 02:14:02.223]  Or they'll go on the edge of the university and sit there on a street corner where some nut can preach or somebody can talk about a football game and he puts that in his lawsuit.
[02:14:02.503 --> 02:14:03.484]  But they get arrested.
[02:14:03.524 --> 02:14:04.264]  They get grabbed.
[02:14:04.284 --> 02:14:05.145]  They get charged.
[02:14:06.065 --> 02:14:08.529]  And I appreciate him holding through this five-minute diatribe.
[02:14:10.352 --> 02:14:12.655]  Michael Markavich, thank you so much for coming on with us.
[02:14:13.015 --> 02:14:14.297]  It's good to be with you again, Alex.
[02:14:14.898 --> 02:14:15.900]  You bet.
[02:14:17.021 --> 02:14:19.865]  Major polls in America show that we've reversed them.
[02:14:20.066 --> 02:14:20.907]  We're winning the fight.
[02:14:21.708 --> 02:14:29.373]  Thank God, thank Yahweh, that abortion is now, what, 70% of young people are against it?
[02:14:29.973 --> 02:14:31.114]  20 years ago it was the opposite?
[02:14:31.134 --> 02:14:32.454]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:14:32.494 --> 02:14:39.298]  There is significant progress being made against abortion in America, and our hope is that this continues.
[02:14:39.318 --> 02:14:46.362]  The South Dakota and Mississippi as states, I mean, this is unheard of, where we have the states now trying to eliminate abortion.
[02:14:46.462 --> 02:14:47.203]  So that's a good thing.
[02:14:48.610 --> 02:14:52.053]  So they can't beat us, so they're going to try to gag us.
[02:14:52.674 --> 02:15:04.044]  And everywhere, anti-war protesters, Second Amendment demonstrators, land rights people, people are getting arrested, charged as terrorists, going to jail for wearing T-shirts that say, Peace on Earth.
[02:15:04.724 --> 02:15:06.366]  You've faced 47 years in prison.
[02:15:06.546 --> 02:15:09.409]  Thank God you had video of it, for praying on a street corner peaceably.
[02:15:09.689 --> 02:15:10.670]  I mean, this is getting scary.
[02:15:11.110 --> 02:15:11.351]  Michael?
[02:15:11.691 --> 02:15:17.843]  Oh, without question, and I was watching your video the other day, what was going on in New York City during the Republican Convention.
[02:15:17.903 --> 02:15:19.126]  I was up there as well, and I was
[02:15:19.865 --> 02:15:25.086]  Put in jail for 32 hours in one of those cages they had and transferred around up there.
[02:15:25.126 --> 02:15:27.287]  So it is getting significant.
[02:15:27.547 --> 02:15:33.888]  Harriet, if you had a sign or were standing around talking to people, you had a good chance of cops just walking over and taking you to jail.
[02:15:34.288 --> 02:15:35.129]  Yeah, without question.
[02:15:35.169 --> 02:15:38.429]  We have a pending federal lawsuit against the city of New York in regards to that.
[02:15:38.489 --> 02:15:45.591]  We need to fight this and we need to do what we can to stop this impeding doom that we have in eliminating free speech.
[02:15:47.082 --> 02:15:55.344]  For those who don't know, before we get into the latest case, why don't you tell us, just in a nutshell, what happened a year and a half ago when you guys were facing 47 years in prison?
[02:15:55.904 --> 02:15:58.545]  Well, we were in Philadelphia at an event called Outfest.
[02:15:58.565 --> 02:16:02.266]  It's the largest coming out day in the world, as the group describes it.
[02:16:02.366 --> 02:16:11.288]  And basically, we were there to minister the gospel to those in attendance, to let them know there's freedom from this lifestyle through Jesus Christ.
[02:16:11.388 --> 02:16:12.388]  And when we had...
[02:16:12.990 --> 02:16:15.812]  By the way, the same thing happened in Nazi Germany.
[02:16:15.833 --> 02:16:20.476]  The Nazis, for five years, simply bullied and tried to suppress people to intimidate them from coming out on the streets.
[02:16:20.517 --> 02:16:20.617]  Right.
[02:16:40.273 --> 02:16:56.718]  Yes, and our group ranged in age from 17 to 72, so we had a couple of grandmothers out there having to deal with this harassment, and according to the Pennsylvania law, it is stalking to follow people around in public places with the intention of interfering and harassing with them while they're engaged in whatever it is.
[02:16:56.778 --> 02:17:07.402]  I couldn't follow the mayor around and try to block the mayor of Philadelphia, but I could certainly inquire and go up to him and exercise free speech just as anyone else, and we encourage that.
[02:17:07.462 --> 02:17:08.642]  We want them to come out.
[02:17:09.235 --> 02:17:09.896]  We're good to go.
[02:17:34.241 --> 02:17:37.926]  And when we got out of jail, we were charged with three felonies and five misdemeanors.
[02:17:38.526 --> 02:17:41.810]  And you had video of all of it doing absolutely nothing.
[02:17:42.671 --> 02:17:43.352]  We'll be right back.
[02:17:43.412 --> 02:17:43.813]  Stay with us.

[02:20:00.279 --> 02:20:05.783]  From the rebels of this war, the Illuminati will establish their world government, prophesied in Revelation chapter 13.
[02:20:07.244 --> 02:20:17.212]  Communism said they would pretend to collapse, and when America had begun to disarm, the combined communist world would launch a surprise attack and smash us with their clenched fists.

[02:21:57.387 --> 02:21:59.309]  Michael Markavich joins us.
[02:21:59.890 --> 02:22:01.711]  Now understand, I've seen the video of this.
[02:22:01.771 --> 02:22:08.158]  It was in the Philadelphia papers, even in national papers, and they would calmly report it like it was normal, trying to normalize it.
[02:22:08.578 --> 02:22:16.065]  Well, they prayed, and they're being charged with hate crimes, facing 47 years for their terrorist activities, and this is what you deserve.
[02:22:16.946 --> 02:22:18.468]  And they've got laws all over the country.
[02:22:18.488 --> 02:22:21.871]  Portland, Oregon's got one, where if you criticize homosexuality, you get arrested.
[02:22:22.717 --> 02:22:26.562]  Folks, even if you love that and think it's great, shouldn't you defend free speech?
[02:22:26.882 --> 02:22:29.706]  I'm sick of these groups saying we don't have free speech.
[02:22:29.806 --> 02:22:31.228]  I defend everybody's free speech.
[02:22:32.129 --> 02:22:34.892]  And listen, I'm not allowed to go to UT.
[02:22:35.808 --> 02:22:37.550]  And it's like half of downtown.
[02:22:37.610 --> 02:22:38.130]  It's huge.
[02:22:38.711 --> 02:22:41.053]  And supposedly even talk to anybody.
[02:22:41.373 --> 02:22:41.953]  But don't worry.
[02:22:41.973 --> 02:22:48.039]  You can go preach as long as it's saying that we come from turkeys or possums or something.
[02:22:48.439 --> 02:22:51.521]  But you can go down there and talk about something serious they don't like.
[02:22:52.042 --> 02:22:53.263]  It's all selective.
[02:22:53.423 --> 02:22:56.686]  And that just happened at a university with Mr. Markavage.
[02:22:57.186 --> 02:22:58.307]  And so now he's suing them.
[02:22:58.347 --> 02:23:00.289]  And we're going to talk about that more in the next segment.
[02:23:00.589 --> 02:23:02.331]  But right now, the really egregious...
[02:23:03.152 --> 02:23:03.832]  Absolutely.
[02:23:03.852 --> 02:23:06.854]  We were actually attempting to work with the police.
[02:23:06.874 --> 02:23:09.395]  We moved from one location where they told us to go to another.
[02:23:09.415 --> 02:23:10.035]  We went to the next location.
[02:23:10.055 --> 02:23:11.096]  They told us to stop there.
[02:23:11.116 --> 02:23:11.556]  We stopped there.
[02:23:30.291 --> 02:23:34.493]  And by this time, we were stopped in the middle of the street where there was an alleyway.
[02:23:34.753 --> 02:23:43.437]  And I'm just kind of thinking this is kind of an odd place for the captain of the Philadelphia Police Department to have a stop because we had some signs and we were singing some hymns.
[02:23:44.318 --> 02:23:48.140]  And, well, they had some paddy wagons waiting for us.
[02:23:48.180 --> 02:23:49.300]  They pulled them down the alley.
[02:23:50.161 --> 02:23:52.622]  They put us in the paddy wagons and took us away.
[02:23:53.462 --> 02:23:58.045]  And we got through getting information for this hearing, this trial,
[02:23:59.609 --> 02:24:00.890]  Because we filed a federal lawsuit.
[02:24:00.930 --> 02:24:02.891]  We got a copy of their police videotape.
[02:24:03.651 --> 02:24:09.335]  And we see the police in this videotape having these strange conversations, kind of looking at the camera.
[02:24:09.435 --> 02:24:10.735]  It was almost like it was planned.
[02:24:10.755 --> 02:24:15.538]  And they were saying, we're going to have the religious right here, and that's not going to go over too well with them.
[02:24:16.038 --> 02:24:17.839]  We want to protect everyone's free speech.
[02:24:17.919 --> 02:24:23.162]  And it was all kind of a strange setup, it seemed, through this video that we saw.
[02:24:23.723 --> 02:24:25.844]  So we actually filed a conspiracy claim
[02:24:26.480 --> 02:24:36.002]  With our lawsuit that includes both the Philadelphia organization... Now understand, it wasn't enough for them to just arrest you being in downtown Philadelphia.
[02:24:36.022 --> 02:24:40.804]  Then they wanted to put you in jail for many years, and even some of Bush's U.S.
[02:24:40.864 --> 02:24:43.064]  attorneys were helping on the whole situation.
[02:24:43.084 --> 02:24:44.064]  Tell folks about that.
[02:24:44.745 --> 02:24:54.487]  Yeah, well, we had come out of prison after 21 hours out of jail, after 21 hours, and got charged with ethnic intimidation, which is the Pennsylvania hate crimes law.
[02:24:58.171 --> 02:25:03.155]  You've been told that hate crimes after, say, a black man gets gunned down, we throw this charge on top of it.
[02:25:03.475 --> 02:25:05.257]  No, it's your speech, folks.
[02:25:07.418 --> 02:25:07.839]  That's right.
[02:25:08.599 --> 02:25:09.340]  Just the speech.
[02:25:09.400 --> 02:25:09.780]  Go ahead.
[02:25:10.240 --> 02:25:13.082]  We were charged with riots, although there was no riot.
[02:25:13.203 --> 02:25:18.727]  We were charged with criminal conspiracy because we all planned on coming to this event.
[02:25:19.547 --> 02:25:21.729]  Then we were charged with five misdemeanors.
[02:25:22.432 --> 02:25:30.556]  All these charges could have landed us individually in jail each 47 years and $90,000 in fines each.
[02:25:31.577 --> 02:25:33.538]  So it was a travesty in that.
[02:25:33.558 --> 02:25:37.720]  Now understand, folks, they were polite, they were nice, they were well-spoken.
[02:25:38.100 --> 02:25:41.702]  They were just walking down the street praying with signs.
[02:25:42.243 --> 02:25:44.704]  And in America, the cops were so warped,
[02:25:45.279 --> 02:25:49.404]  They actually went and arrested him, and then they got charged, and all of this happened.
[02:25:49.424 --> 02:25:50.545]  It finally got thrown out, though.
[02:25:50.985 --> 02:25:51.226]  Yes.
[02:25:51.666 --> 02:25:53.789]  A common police court judge dismissed the charges.
[02:25:53.809 --> 02:25:58.394]  She looked at the videotape, and she said there's no merit to any of these charges.
[02:25:58.834 --> 02:26:01.197]  So that was a good thing, but just imagine if a judge...
[02:26:05.919 --> 02:26:07.259]  Well, Mark, let's face it.
[02:26:07.839 --> 02:26:09.200]  I mean, Michael, let's face it.
[02:26:09.240 --> 02:26:15.401]  We have to get ready for this as Christians, as freedom fighters, as people that are going to fight evil, period.
[02:26:16.141 --> 02:26:17.681]  Some of us are going to have to go to prison.
[02:26:18.121 --> 02:26:20.462]  But the New World Order is going to lose in the end.
[02:26:20.502 --> 02:26:25.423]  If we have the attitude of, no, we better roll over to go along with them, then it's going to be far worse for us.
[02:26:25.703 --> 02:26:26.063]  That's right.
[02:26:28.052 --> 02:26:31.714]  I mean, if people have to go to jail for standing up for defenseless babies, so be it.
[02:26:31.754 --> 02:26:36.476]  If people have to go to jail to stand up against DU being used on our troops and other people, so be it.
[02:26:36.516 --> 02:26:39.338]  I mean, nothing worth anything ever came free.
[02:26:39.658 --> 02:26:40.078]  That's right.
[02:26:40.138 --> 02:26:40.458]  That's right.
[02:26:40.478 --> 02:26:44.420]  We must fight, and if it requires jail time, then I'm willing and I'm ready.
[02:26:45.801 --> 02:26:47.502]  You'll just have a ministry in prison, won't you?
[02:26:47.522 --> 02:26:48.462]  That's right.
[02:26:49.763 --> 02:26:51.504]  So there's something to look forward to in that respect.
[02:26:52.637 --> 02:26:57.259]  Well, I mean, it does show that America's a changing place, because you're a defender of free speech, period.
[02:26:57.279 --> 02:27:11.667]  I mean, I'm sure you're aware of what's in the new Patriot Act expansion, a new national police force, and the national police at any place can designate you're not allowed to be there, and then instantly arrest you, not even give you a chance to leave, just instantly arrest you.
[02:27:11.687 --> 02:27:12.347]  Did you hear about that?
[02:27:12.647 --> 02:27:14.188]  Yes, I have, and it's very disturbing.
[02:27:15.889 --> 02:27:17.249]  By the way, folks, I'm not exaggerating.
[02:27:17.289 --> 02:27:18.210]  It actually says that.
[02:27:18.966 --> 02:27:21.268]  I've got some stuff even worse they're trying to pass right now.
[02:27:22.149 --> 02:27:23.610]  The stuff we just mentioned has passed.
[02:27:24.090 --> 02:27:27.713]  Mark, I keep saying Mark as one of our callers is Mark.
[02:27:27.813 --> 02:27:30.895]  Mark, Greg, others, your calls are coming up here after the break.
[02:27:31.296 --> 02:27:33.157]  Michael Markavage is our guest.
[02:27:33.597 --> 02:27:36.099]  Infowars.com and prisonplanet.com are the websites.
[02:27:36.360 --> 02:27:37.280]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.741 --> 02:27:39.342]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:40.263 --> 02:27:42.945]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.152 --> 02:27:50.677]  And the result is small metal particles circulating through your oil, causing premature wear and damage to your engine.
[02:28:03.072 --> 02:28:08.715]  Oil filters do a good job of trapping the large metal particles, but they will not trap the most harmful tiny particles.
[02:28:09.015 --> 02:28:14.257]  These tiny particles circulate constantly through your oil, and over time your engine begins to show signs of wear.
[02:28:14.517 --> 02:28:16.618]  This is why you need the filter mag.
[02:28:16.878 --> 02:28:29.024]  The filter mag is a powerful magnet that holds itself to the outside of your oil filter, trapping the tiny metal particles to the inside wall of the filter, extending the life of your oil and ultimately extending the life of your engine.
[02:28:29.264 --> 02:28:33.670]  The reusable FilterMag is maintenance-free, installs in two seconds, and lasts forever.
[02:28:33.890 --> 02:28:34.851]  So what are you waiting for?
[02:28:35.032 --> 02:28:36.654]  Go to FilterMag.com.
[02:28:36.774 --> 02:28:38.576]  That's FilterMag.com.
[02:28:38.836 --> 02:28:39.297]  Or call 800-345-8376.
[02:28:39.337 --> 02:28:39.517]  That's 800-345-8376.
[02:28:46.471 --> 02:28:53.977]  Get the new Berkey battery adapter, an inexpensive yet long-term backup power supply for your Berkey Light LED system.
[02:28:54.258 --> 02:29:05.167]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because, incredibly, they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark.
[02:29:05.447 --> 02:29:07.249]  Yet require very little energy.
[02:29:07.509 --> 02:29:10.832]  That's why this revolutionary new technology is a bit expensive.
[02:29:11.173 --> 02:29:12.514]  But it's worth every penny.
[02:29:12.634 --> 02:29:21.623]  Because the low energy LEDs are able to provide light all night long for over two weeks on a single set of four AA alkaline batteries.
[02:29:21.923 --> 02:29:22.404]  That's right.
[02:29:22.604 --> 02:29:29.710]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[02:29:30.011 --> 02:29:38.639]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey battery adapter, complete with on-off switch for only $10 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:29:42.382 --> 02:29:45.803]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[02:29:46.763 --> 02:29:52.505]  Discover a natural way to experience healthier, cleaner indoor air without expensive filters and high-maintenance machines.
[02:29:52.765 --> 02:29:55.246]  Discover what natural health professionals have known for decades.
[02:29:55.406 --> 02:29:58.027]  Natural salt lamps ionize and purify indoor air.
[02:29:58.187 --> 02:30:01.888]  Natural salt lamps come handcrafted from salt crystals that are millions of years old.
[02:30:01.988 --> 02:30:07.070]  These lamps create healthy ions that eliminate odor, reduce bacteria, and can help allergy and asthma sufferers.
[02:30:07.290 --> 02:30:07.731]  We're good to go.
[02:30:29.974 --> 02:30:31.055]  We're talking to Michael Markavich.
[02:30:59.480 --> 02:31:00.741]  With Repent America.
[02:31:02.203 --> 02:31:03.884]  And whether you love him or hate him, I love him.
[02:31:05.345 --> 02:31:07.507]  You should fight to the death for his right of free speech.
[02:31:07.567 --> 02:31:09.970]  I mean, I don't want to hear it because we've got terrorists attacking us.
[02:31:10.230 --> 02:31:12.212]  Just this whole backdrop of police state.
[02:31:12.232 --> 02:31:13.032]  This isn't a joke.
[02:31:13.052 --> 02:31:14.794]  I mean, I've been in New York.
[02:31:14.854 --> 02:31:19.018]  I've been in other parts of the country where the cops come over and just arrest people for no reason.
[02:31:19.618 --> 02:31:21.400]  And then put false charges on them.
[02:31:21.440 --> 02:31:23.382]  You know, that came out in New York at the RNC.
[02:31:24.525 --> 02:31:26.887]  That they would just then put false charges on you.
[02:31:26.947 --> 02:31:33.532]  Police that weren't even there at your arrest would just fill out some things, in some cases felony charges, who weren't even there.
[02:31:34.874 --> 02:31:41.079]  I mean, when the government will just, yeah, let's put them in life, you know, put them in prison for the rest of their life, 47 years.
[02:31:41.759 --> 02:31:45.062]  Let's just arrest those people and charge them with a felony that's five years in prison.
[02:31:45.522 --> 02:31:47.624]  Yeah, I wasn't there, but I'll just fill out a report.
[02:31:47.644 --> 02:31:49.005]  Hey, let's pick a crime, Bob.
[02:31:49.425 --> 02:31:49.866]  Okay.
[02:31:50.466 --> 02:31:52.388]  I mean, the government is going criminal.
[02:31:53.351 --> 02:31:55.473]  And they tried to pass all this hate crimes legislation?
[02:31:56.393 --> 02:32:01.778]  Listen, the guys that drugged that poor black man to death out in Jasper, Texas, they were all given the death penalty.
[02:32:02.458 --> 02:32:03.839]  Do they need a, quote, hate crime?
[02:32:04.340 --> 02:32:07.022]  You hear, oh, the government wouldn't let us have a hate crime.
[02:32:07.542 --> 02:32:09.004]  The evil right-wingers wouldn't.
[02:32:09.864 --> 02:32:10.965]  They went unpunished.
[02:32:11.005 --> 02:32:14.808]  I remember hearing national PSA propaganda pieces saying that.
[02:32:15.008 --> 02:32:16.249]  They were all given the death penalty.
[02:32:16.309 --> 02:32:20.753]  No, it's going to be used against anti-war activists, pro-life activists.
[02:32:21.326 --> 02:32:24.629]  It's going to be used against anybody that the establishment doesn't like.
[02:32:24.669 --> 02:32:36.538]  Listen, I found out that when I was in England, they were arresting reporters, mainstream reporters, ITN TV producers, who would do things like get a copy of the police report of the Demendez shooting.
[02:32:37.038 --> 02:32:39.880]  I didn't know why the cops came over and threatened to arrest me and took down my info.
[02:32:39.920 --> 02:32:44.564]  Little did I know, I was about to go to jail and be charged and spend time in a British prison.
[02:32:45.587 --> 02:32:53.273]  I've now done research and learned that all around me they were arresting reporters and police to cover up that shooting, which was clearly a government op, covering something else up.
[02:32:54.434 --> 02:32:56.356]  The point is that things are getting scary.
[02:32:57.054 --> 02:32:57.675]  We're good to go.
[02:33:23.494 --> 02:33:24.294]  We're good to go.
[02:33:24.354 --> 02:33:24.654]  I think?
[02:33:41.369 --> 02:33:47.774]  And what we do is we organize different events and efforts to proclaim the gospel of Jesus Christ publicly.
[02:33:47.794 --> 02:33:53.739]  So that is our goal, and our theme is calling a nation in rebellion toward God to repentance.
[02:33:54.239 --> 02:33:57.662]  What is the establishment, Michael, so afraid of?
[02:33:57.722 --> 02:34:00.804]  I mean, there have always been people on soapboxes.
[02:34:01.365 --> 02:34:04.287]  In the past, you could go anywhere you wanted and do that.
[02:34:04.327 --> 02:34:07.149]  Then they said, oh, you've got to have a permit, which has been proven to be unconstitutional.
[02:34:07.169 --> 02:34:08.731]  And then, oh, we're not going to issue it.
[02:34:08.751 --> 02:34:10.272]  And then, oh, your speech is offensive.
[02:34:10.902 --> 02:34:17.064]  And then now Scarborough gets up on TV and says, we need to arrest these school teachers that are criticizing the president.
[02:34:17.084 --> 02:34:18.184]  You're not allowed to do that.
[02:34:18.584 --> 02:34:19.725]  I mean, what happened to us?
[02:34:19.825 --> 02:34:22.365]  Why is this elite so afraid of free speech?
[02:34:23.066 --> 02:34:40.631]  That's a very good question, and I'm sure it's a multi-pronged answer in that there's so much that's been going on where government officials are being challenged, they're being held accountable by the people through the use of the First Amendment, and government has no other option but to somehow suppress that and to interfere with it.
[02:34:43.311 --> 02:34:49.157]  What are some other examples, I know there's a lot of them, of Christians having their free speech violated here in the United States?
[02:34:49.177 --> 02:34:52.780]  And then I want to get into this latest incident that you personally experienced.
[02:34:53.701 --> 02:35:01.429]  Well, I know of others who have had similar experiences dealing with the issue of having been arrested because they have pro-life signs...
[02:35:02.256 --> 02:35:10.600]  In fact, interestingly enough, in New York, I was arrested amongst many other different types of people who I don't necessarily agree with on different positions.
[02:35:10.660 --> 02:35:19.484]  And the reason was because we were there with the purpose of challenging government officials concerning their actions and their allowance of abortion.
[02:35:20.444 --> 02:35:27.447]  So in jail for that 32 hours, I was handcuffed to homosexuals, I was handcuffed to anti-war protesters, and all kinds of people.
[02:35:27.467 --> 02:35:29.268]  And we could all at least agree on one thing,
[02:35:29.798 --> 02:35:32.920]  And that is what happened in New York City at the Republican National Convention.
[02:35:32.960 --> 02:35:35.962]  The convention was outrageous and unacceptable.
[02:35:36.542 --> 02:35:43.207]  Well, I interviewed you after it happened, but I also interviewed an American Spectator writer.
[02:35:43.667 --> 02:35:49.551]  And he was just standing away from a crowd, taking photos of it and writing notes.
[02:35:50.332 --> 02:35:52.813]  And the cops came right over to him and said, You're going too, buddy.
[02:35:52.853 --> 02:35:53.594]  Drug him off.
[02:35:54.054 --> 02:35:56.015]  And then falsified reports on him.
[02:35:56.736 --> 02:35:56.916]  Right.
[02:35:58.166 --> 02:35:59.528]  Well, this is what they're saying.
[02:35:59.588 --> 02:36:03.191]  They're saying it's in the name of safety that they're doing these things.
[02:36:04.052 --> 02:36:07.656]  And they're saying that for safety reasons, we can't allow you to cross the street.
[02:36:07.696 --> 02:36:10.058]  This is another example in another federal lawsuit we have.
[02:36:10.098 --> 02:36:15.163]  I couldn't cross the street where everybody else was going is because they feared for my life, the police.
[02:36:15.504 --> 02:36:18.086]  Although there was no visible signs of violence of any kind.
[02:36:19.087 --> 02:36:21.370]  This was another incident in Philadelphia before.
[02:36:22.560 --> 02:36:24.762]  Well, that's the Soviet Union or Rwanda.
[02:36:24.782 --> 02:36:31.747]  We're going to send the Christians to this camp for their safety, and then the UN kills everybody or brings in the Hutus to do it.
[02:36:32.167 --> 02:36:33.788]  The same thing with the Soviet Union.
[02:36:33.808 --> 02:36:35.510]  We're going to drug you for your safety.
[02:36:35.550 --> 02:36:37.711]  We're going to take your freedom for your safety.
[02:36:38.392 --> 02:36:38.572]  Right.
[02:36:40.911 --> 02:36:56.304]  What about this latest case where you're there on the edge of the university grounds and in your lawsuit you pointed out that if somebody was there talking about sports it would be acceptable but if you start talking about abortion being bad then you get arrested.
[02:36:56.804 --> 02:36:57.205]  Exactly.
[02:36:57.245 --> 02:37:04.711]  Well, every year we have a pro-life tour and we travel around the greater Philadelphia and surrounding areas to expose the reality of abortion.
[02:37:04.731 --> 02:37:06.913]  We have some photographs that show an abortion.
[02:37:07.592 --> 02:37:11.835]  And what we do is we speak to people, hand out literature, and so on.
[02:37:12.455 --> 02:37:23.201]  And at this previous entity here in October, we had our tour, and I was on a sidewalk outside of Westchester University in Westchester, Pennsylvania.
[02:37:23.321 --> 02:37:25.462]  It's a Commonwealth university.
[02:37:25.563 --> 02:37:31.106]  It's run by a state agency called the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education.
[02:37:31.126 --> 02:37:35.048]  And they have this ordinance, if you will.
[02:37:35.388 --> 02:37:36.549]  They call it a policy...
[02:37:37.185 --> 02:37:37.986]  We're good to go.
[02:37:51.186 --> 02:37:54.809]  Sir, the University of Texas just did a few years ago.
[02:37:54.829 --> 02:38:07.937]  Now they just don't allow anything, and then you've got to go ask them for permission, and if a student group doesn't certify you, then you can't come on, and even if the student group certifies you, they refuse the student groups.
[02:38:09.017 --> 02:38:17.403]  Well, that's just an unconstitutional, obvious policy they have, and in this case, we're challenging Westchester's, and hopefully we'll follow...
[02:38:18.285 --> 02:38:18.866]  Yeah, we're good to go.
[02:38:35.342 --> 02:38:37.724]  And they said they changed it after our... They're not laws.
[02:38:37.804 --> 02:38:38.424]  They're not laws.
[02:38:38.444 --> 02:38:39.465]  They're policies.
[02:38:39.525 --> 02:38:39.946]  That's right.
[02:38:40.146 --> 02:38:43.348]  And they changed it after you were there last time, admitting they changed it for you.
[02:38:43.789 --> 02:38:44.189]  Exactly.
[02:38:44.449 --> 02:38:47.572]  So they're just trying to adapt it to see where they could fit it into the law.
[02:38:47.592 --> 02:38:51.815]  So they believe they have reasonable time, place, and manner restrictions that they can use.
[02:38:52.335 --> 02:38:56.519]  So they have these 50-foot buffer zones against any property.
[02:38:56.559 --> 02:39:00.522]  So we have to be 50 feet away from... And it's like George Bush free speech zones.
[02:39:00.982 --> 02:39:01.403]  Exactly.
[02:39:01.663 --> 02:39:04.485]  Now, this is only after you get the approval two hours in advance
[02:39:04.949 --> 02:39:05.870]  Before you could even do it.
[02:39:05.950 --> 02:39:08.934]  So it completely eliminates spontaneous speech, number one.
[02:39:08.974 --> 02:39:22.693]  So if President Bush decided to show up on campus for whatever reason and there were some anti-war protesters who wanted to be out there, they couldn't do it because that moment in time would be lost forever if his visit didn't last two hours, which it probably wouldn't.
[02:39:23.294 --> 02:39:25.555]  So this is exactly what is happening.
[02:39:25.575 --> 02:39:27.956]  It eliminates spontaneous speech.
[02:39:28.576 --> 02:39:31.138]  And also, you cannot be anonymous.
[02:39:31.178 --> 02:39:33.659]  You have to register by giving your information.
[02:39:33.679 --> 02:39:36.400]  They cannot allow you to come on a campus without giving your information.
[02:39:36.420 --> 02:39:38.301]  Now, this is a state university.
[02:39:38.381 --> 02:39:39.482]  It's public property.
[02:39:40.302 --> 02:39:49.066]  And not only that, we did leave the campus itself, but we stood on the sidewalk where there's parking meters, telephone poles, and such, a public right of way.
[02:39:49.830 --> 02:39:51.532]  And I had stood on the sidewalk.
[02:39:51.572 --> 02:39:53.634]  They said, no, you can't even stand on the sidewalk.
[02:39:54.314 --> 02:39:56.216]  We own from the curb inward.
[02:39:56.976 --> 02:40:04.743]  So I'd have to stand out on the road, which is the state road, in order to engage in expressive activity.
[02:40:05.924 --> 02:40:09.287]  And then the police will arrive there and say you've got to have a free speech permit.
[02:40:09.327 --> 02:40:13.191]  Yeah, the municipal police probably would have arrived and said I would need a permit for there.
[02:40:13.291 --> 02:40:16.894]  Same folks that have taken you on for 47 years in prison you were present in.
[02:40:17.415 --> 02:40:18.675]  So it's just a freedom fest.
[02:40:18.695 --> 02:40:19.276]  I mean, you know what?
[02:40:19.336 --> 02:40:20.876]  It sounds just like Communist China.
[02:40:21.416 --> 02:40:21.596]  Yes.
[02:40:22.457 --> 02:40:25.238]  And by the way, folks, in Communist China, they do have protests.
[02:40:25.458 --> 02:40:26.398]  I'm sure you've been hearing a lot.
[02:40:26.418 --> 02:40:28.759]  Well, I guess you probably haven't, folks, because it's barely in the news.
[02:40:29.059 --> 02:40:36.841]  They just go into whole towns now and just machine gun farmers because they're refusing to just give their land away because they'll basically starve to death.
[02:40:36.881 --> 02:40:41.043]  And now they have Tiananmen squares every month over there for the last two years.
[02:40:41.163 --> 02:40:42.643]  And it's a footnote in our news.
[02:40:42.943 --> 02:40:45.164]  And I've seen national newspapers act like, well, the
[02:40:45.724 --> 02:40:49.205]  Government and China dealt with some problems, taught them.
[02:40:49.225 --> 02:40:53.646]  I mean, our government's really changing, whereas it was Tiananmen Square back in the late 80s.
[02:40:53.926 --> 02:40:56.646]  Now it's just, well, China dealt with some problem people.
[02:40:58.927 --> 02:41:05.608]  Well, Alex, I was charged with defiant trespass in this case, and the district attorney decided to get involved.
[02:41:05.828 --> 02:41:10.249]  Now the district attorney is coming after me, and I face up to a year in prison and a $2,500 fine.
[02:41:12.043 --> 02:41:15.044]  If I'm found guilty of defiant trespass.
[02:41:15.084 --> 02:41:17.245]  Because I said, I'm going to stand here.
[02:41:17.265 --> 02:41:18.485]  This is the public sidewalk.
[02:41:18.585 --> 02:41:20.906]  Universities are supposed to be about free speech.
[02:41:20.966 --> 02:41:21.226]  That's right.
[02:41:21.266 --> 02:41:24.367]  You weren't in a classroom screaming into a doorway.
[02:41:24.667 --> 02:41:26.047]  You weren't screaming into the window.
[02:41:26.107 --> 02:41:27.107]  You were out in the area.
[02:41:27.487 --> 02:41:30.828]  I mean, that's why universities have forums in courts.
[02:41:31.168 --> 02:41:36.010]  That's why they normally have an area that's raised in the middle of a university court.
[02:41:36.190 --> 02:41:39.871]  Because that's what's supposed to be going on there is a free flow of ideas.
[02:41:40.311 --> 02:41:41.392]  A universe of ideas.
[02:41:41.493 --> 02:41:42.213]  University, yes.
[02:41:42.714 --> 02:41:44.235]  Not anymore, though, brother!
[02:41:44.796 --> 02:41:49.021]  When our doctors don't give Hippocratic oaths, just everything's being abolished.
[02:41:49.501 --> 02:41:49.982]  Absolutely.
[02:41:50.342 --> 02:41:50.743]  Absolutely.
[02:41:50.783 --> 02:41:53.325]  I wasn't even saying anything when they came and sighted me.
[02:41:54.026 --> 02:41:55.548]  I was just standing there with a sign...
[02:41:56.198 --> 02:42:00.520]  And they came, the chief of police, the university police came, wrote the citation.
[02:42:00.540 --> 02:42:01.461]  Do you have video?
[02:42:01.481 --> 02:42:03.041]  They'll claim you were running around with it.
[02:42:03.181 --> 02:42:05.723]  We have video from the last two years of them doing this.
[02:42:05.763 --> 02:42:10.505]  The second year they did it, they didn't cite me last year because we left under the threat of arrest.
[02:42:11.205 --> 02:42:13.426]  And this year, I just said, this is enough.
[02:42:14.026 --> 02:42:15.087]  We're going to stand our ground.
[02:42:15.805 --> 02:42:19.266]  And I had decided that I'd accept the citation and deal with it in the court.
[02:42:19.306 --> 02:42:28.229]  Well, I don't want to hear it from the university libs when they get arrested and spend a year in jail for protesting Bush because they weren't in a free speech zone.
[02:42:28.269 --> 02:42:29.109]  They won't support you.
[02:42:29.129 --> 02:42:33.411]  Now, are you getting support from some of the Che Guevara people?
[02:42:33.831 --> 02:42:44.394]  Well, actually, the county paper in Chester County, Pennsylvania, the local paper there did an editorial condemning the university and this whole...
[02:42:44.983 --> 02:42:45.063]  Well...
[02:43:03.931 --> 02:43:07.515]  I mean, we're now hearing that reporters are going to be arrested if they expose corruption.
[02:43:07.535 --> 02:43:15.364]  We're now hearing... I mean, this is getting scarier and scarier, but the good news is it shows that we're putting heat on the establishment or they wouldn't be doing this.
[02:43:15.404 --> 02:43:17.346]  If we were ineffectual, they wouldn't be getting upset.
[02:43:17.486 --> 02:43:17.886]  That's right.
[02:43:17.966 --> 02:43:18.347]  That's right.
[02:43:18.367 --> 02:43:19.308]  That's a great point.
[02:43:21.576 --> 02:43:26.159]  Well, it's a host of issues where we're starting to have victories, and I think what happened to you is another sign of that.
[02:43:26.179 --> 02:43:29.422]  And, of course, this will just give you more attention for the cause of the unborn.
[02:43:29.442 --> 02:43:38.469]  This will just give more attention to the attack on free speech, and I think it's going to literally blow up in their face politically like it did a year and a half ago.
[02:43:39.149 --> 02:43:45.374]  Well, we hope so, because this district attorney claims that all he's simply trying to do is enforce trespassing laws.
[02:43:46.274 --> 02:43:47.695]  And it's absolutely absurd.
[02:43:47.715 --> 02:43:49.577]  I mean, this is what he is stating publicly.
[02:43:49.597 --> 02:43:50.978]  Well, Vice President Cheney's head...
[02:43:51.613 --> 02:43:52.054]  We're good to go.
[02:43:59.842 --> 02:44:01.623]  And then they take your driver's license number.
[02:44:02.283 --> 02:44:03.364]  This is mainstream news.
[02:44:03.844 --> 02:44:10.229]  And then if you stand up and yell out a question during the questions, they will arrest you and charge you with trespassing.
[02:44:10.589 --> 02:44:14.492]  I mean, what's this new thing where these are public events.
[02:44:14.552 --> 02:44:16.033]  You invite the public in.
[02:44:16.594 --> 02:44:17.514]  It's a public event.
[02:44:17.554 --> 02:44:17.934]  That's right.
[02:44:18.095 --> 02:44:18.495]  That's right.
[02:44:18.675 --> 02:44:22.638]  And any of you should be welcome and accepted as being a part of this.
[02:44:24.019 --> 02:44:25.540]  And that's what we're fighting against.
[02:44:25.560 --> 02:44:28.182]  It seems that every town we go to,
[02:44:28.706 --> 02:44:39.308]  The police come out, have no understanding of the Constitution, and following directives from their superiors, who don't have a clue either, or maybe they do, and they just want to, you know, obviously force us away.
[02:44:40.569 --> 02:44:41.509]  Let's take a call.
[02:44:41.689 --> 02:44:44.109]  Let's go ahead and go to Mike in California.
[02:44:44.129 --> 02:44:44.930]  Thanks for holding, Mike.
[02:44:45.290 --> 02:44:45.770]  Hi, Alex.
[02:44:46.070 --> 02:44:46.290]  Hi.
[02:44:46.610 --> 02:44:48.750]  Thank God for you and for Michael.
[02:44:48.910 --> 02:44:50.031]  Thanks, Mike, for what you're doing.
[02:44:50.171 --> 02:44:51.371]  Thank you for the encouragement.
[02:44:51.791 --> 02:44:55.292]  Yeah, hey, I want to tell you, there's a group out there called the Alliance Defense Fund.
[02:44:55.332 --> 02:44:55.932]  Have you ever heard of them?
[02:44:56.354 --> 02:45:03.297]  In fact, we have allied attorneys of the Alliance Defense Fund that have been filing these cases on our organization's behalf and on my behalf.
[02:45:03.697 --> 02:45:05.918]  So we are very thankful for that.
[02:45:06.218 --> 02:45:17.122]  Okay, I wanted to tell you, you know, I went to seminary and when I was there, this hopefully will be an encouragement to Christians out there because we have a lot more power than we realize.
[02:45:17.402 --> 02:45:25.505]  And what happened was we decided the people in the seminary and the Bible College across the street thought we were going to pray about Halloween one year.
[02:45:26.387 --> 02:45:34.293]  We started praying about three weeks before Halloween and continued praying through to about three weeks past Halloween.
[02:45:34.313 --> 02:45:37.635]  There were about 20 of us total in the two schools.
[02:45:39.076 --> 02:45:49.323]  We met once a week, but we all agreed we would pray each day concerning the things relating to Halloween in the metropolitan Chicago area.
[02:45:49.743 --> 02:45:50.664]  We were just north of Chicago.
[02:45:52.193 --> 02:46:01.478]  So we did that and then had some good results as far as what we felt like God was showing us, what the Lord was showing us to pray during the whole time.
[02:46:01.699 --> 02:46:17.648]  Then after that time period of six weeks passed, one of the group members was listening to the radio and there was an interview going on on one of the radio stations with the Chief of Police of Chicago.
[02:46:17.868 --> 02:46:19.809]  They were talking about a variety of issues.
[02:46:20.782 --> 02:46:23.503]  And then all of a sudden, out of the blue, the chief of police interrupts.
[02:46:23.703 --> 02:46:29.166]  And he says, You know, the weirdest thing happened this last Halloween.
[02:46:30.226 --> 02:46:34.008]  And the radio host replied and asked, Well, what was that?
[02:46:35.048 --> 02:46:37.289]  And the chief of police said, Not a thing.
[02:46:38.390 --> 02:46:39.650]  Not one thing happened.
[02:46:39.670 --> 02:46:40.311]  He said, What do you mean?
[02:46:40.331 --> 02:46:43.292]  And normally Chicago is similar to Detroit, though not as bad.
[02:46:43.332 --> 02:46:45.253]  You had kind of a devil's night there.
[02:46:45.473 --> 02:46:46.833]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:46:47.114 --> 02:46:48.114]  This chief of police said,
[02:46:48.857 --> 02:46:49.997]  We are still scratching our heads.
[02:46:50.017 --> 02:47:01.620]  We can't figure out because for the whole time of Halloween, every year after year after year, it's always been, we have this incredible increase of demonic, satanic garbage going on, crimes all over the place.
[02:47:01.680 --> 02:47:03.320]  It just spikes way up.
[02:47:03.720 --> 02:47:04.461]  That's fantastic.
[02:47:04.481 --> 02:47:07.301]  He said, we saw not one thing.
[02:47:07.441 --> 02:47:08.962]  Well, that's great testimony.
[02:47:09.402 --> 02:47:13.543]  And what I'm hoping is that people will see this and understand they can do the same thing.
[02:47:13.643 --> 02:47:14.723]  It doesn't take very many people.
[02:47:15.203 --> 02:47:15.523]  That's right.
[02:47:16.041 --> 02:47:17.362]  All right, I'm going to move on.
[02:47:17.402 --> 02:47:18.403]  Thank you so much, sir.
[02:47:18.823 --> 02:47:21.385]  Randy, Randy in Arkansas, then Reagan.
[02:47:21.425 --> 02:47:22.326]  Randy, you're on the air.
[02:47:23.207 --> 02:47:24.688]  Yeah, hi, Alex.
[02:47:24.808 --> 02:47:26.029]  Great job you guys are doing.
[02:47:26.109 --> 02:47:27.030]  I love listening to you.
[02:47:27.170 --> 02:47:31.373]  I just wanted to quickly tell you, I'm a black man in Fort Smith, Arkansas.
[02:47:31.734 --> 02:47:32.034]  Yes, sir.
[02:47:32.334 --> 02:47:33.615]  I live in a nice neighborhood.
[02:47:33.635 --> 02:47:34.276]  I'm not prejudiced.
[02:47:34.316 --> 02:47:35.657]  I've never been prejudiced in my life.
[02:47:36.357 --> 02:47:40.140]  I was outside yesterday doing some simple yard work in my front yard.
[02:47:40.201 --> 02:47:41.402]  I came out of my carport.
[02:47:42.162 --> 02:47:43.323]  Police car passed by.
[02:47:43.343 --> 02:47:44.064]  I slowed down.
[02:47:44.144 --> 02:47:45.345]  I'm thinking, what is he doing?
[02:47:46.431 --> 02:47:49.854]  Went to pick up a bag of leaves and stuff I was getting up out of my yard.
[02:47:50.734 --> 02:47:52.816]  Turn around, walk back slowly to my carport.
[02:47:53.557 --> 02:47:54.417]  Came on in the house.
[02:47:54.817 --> 02:47:55.938]  I have a security camera.
[02:47:55.978 --> 02:47:57.500]  This is a nice neighborhood I stay in.
[02:47:57.520 --> 02:47:58.040]  Very nice.
[02:47:58.480 --> 02:47:59.421]  Predominantly white.
[02:48:00.682 --> 02:48:02.183]  Come in and I look on my security camera.
[02:48:02.223 --> 02:48:04.525]  The police is all out in the yard walking around.
[02:48:06.246 --> 02:48:11.570]  My girlfriend goes outside, asks the police, what's the problem?
[02:48:11.610 --> 02:48:14.733]  Well, ma'am, you have a black man prowling around your yard.
[02:48:14.793 --> 02:48:15.393]  Go back in the house.
[02:48:15.433 --> 02:48:16.134]  We'll take care of this.
[02:48:17.040 --> 02:48:17.320]  Wow.
[02:48:17.721 --> 02:48:20.142]  So I go outside and ask the cop, what is he doing?
[02:48:20.182 --> 02:48:24.505]  And he says, uh, we thought you was prowling around in a yard, you know.
[02:48:25.546 --> 02:48:29.209]  I mean, that's just ridiculous that things happen like this in this country.
[02:48:29.229 --> 02:48:30.049]  It's just ridiculous.
[02:48:31.030 --> 02:48:31.711]  That is shameful.
[02:48:32.131 --> 02:48:36.274]  Well, I'll tell you what, it deals with policing psychology.
[02:48:36.334 --> 02:48:44.920]  Instead of going after the crimes that have been committed and punishing people, the cops are all out basically just writing tickets so they don't know real policing.
[02:48:44.940 --> 02:48:45.441]  We'll be right back.
[02:48:47.717 --> 02:48:50.560]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[02:48:50.840 --> 02:48:52.401]  Hello, my friends, Alex Jones here.
[02:48:52.762 --> 02:48:57.426]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law, 9-11, Rise of the Police State.

[02:49:02.631 --> 02:49:06.815]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[02:49:07.035 --> 02:49:09.878]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[02:49:09.978 --> 02:49:12.440]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks,
[02:49:12.640 --> 02:49:19.205]  With the roots and history of its orchestrators, Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[02:49:19.445 --> 02:49:26.671]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that is sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.

[02:50:04.477 --> 02:50:15.821]  When used, water flow through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[02:50:16.421 --> 02:50:23.267]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements, where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[02:50:23.647 --> 02:50:25.789]  Your purified water is now ready.
[02:50:26.289 --> 02:50:31.273]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 host filter elements.

[02:51:20.020 --> 02:51:20.320]  I think?
[02:51:46.923 --> 02:51:52.048]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:51:52.749 --> 02:51:55.112]  Because there's a war on for your mind.

[02:52:01.939 --> 02:52:02.880]  And I don't want to hear it.
[02:52:03.640 --> 02:52:04.021]  Okay.
[02:52:05.943 --> 02:52:10.084]  You don't go get somebody pregnant and then go have an abortion and kill the baby and then lie to yourself about it.
[02:52:10.104 --> 02:52:11.504]  And if you don't like it, fine.
[02:52:11.964 --> 02:52:14.645]  I mean, Democrats act like it's some holy sacrament.
[02:52:15.125 --> 02:52:16.825]  It's really special, abortion.
[02:52:16.865 --> 02:52:19.646]  You smile and giggle and laugh about it and jump around about it.
[02:52:20.146 --> 02:52:20.886]  It's not funny.
[02:52:21.026 --> 02:52:22.866]  It's a part and parcel of all this other evil.
[02:52:24.067 --> 02:52:27.027]  But regardless, people have the right to protest against it.
[02:52:27.767 --> 02:52:29.988]  And we have the right to wake people up to not do it.
[02:52:30.008 --> 02:52:35.449]  You know, most women don't know that they can get paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to have that baby and give it up for adoption.
[02:52:36.613 --> 02:52:42.058]  So there's a shortage in babies for adoption, so CPS goes out and steals babies to give to people.
[02:52:42.418 --> 02:52:43.339]  Oh, I bet you didn't know that.
[02:52:43.379 --> 02:52:50.165]  See, women, they didn't tell you that instead of paying 500 bucks to kill your baby, you can get paid tens of thousands of dollars.
[02:52:51.026 --> 02:52:51.286]  See?
[02:52:51.606 --> 02:52:53.007]  See, you're not given your options.
[02:52:53.648 --> 02:52:58.492]  In fact, did you know there are less abortions every year in this country than there are people wanting to adopt?
[02:52:59.093 --> 02:53:01.475]  I don't want to hear liberals go, nobody wants those babies.
[02:53:02.020 --> 02:53:03.821]  We're almost out of time here, folks.
[02:53:05.381 --> 02:53:06.962]  We've been talking about the First Amendment here.
[02:53:07.422 --> 02:53:10.003]  Let's talk to Regan in Sacramento, California.
[02:53:10.023 --> 02:53:10.543]  Go ahead, Regan.
[02:53:10.563 --> 02:53:12.884]  You're on the air with myself and Michael Markavich.
[02:53:13.225 --> 02:53:13.865]  Hi.
[02:53:14.105 --> 02:53:14.965]  I have a question.
[02:53:15.025 --> 02:53:18.687]  I've been listening to you for about almost a year now.
[02:53:18.807 --> 02:53:23.389]  I wouldn't call you the one person that I feel I can call and get some honest feedback for.
[02:53:24.429 --> 02:53:29.331]  I'm a little worried about people with disabilities, this whole Illuminati thing and
[02:53:30.160 --> 02:53:32.541]  Rounding people up and kill them.
[02:53:32.861 --> 02:53:38.964]  I have a disability and I wonder how long it's going to be before they start rounding us up and killing us.
[02:53:41.406 --> 02:53:44.187]  They'll just euthanize you when you go into the hospital for care.
[02:53:44.227 --> 02:53:47.228]  And look, that's why this mentality is being hyped up.
[02:53:47.308 --> 02:53:49.129]  Abortion is part and parcel of that.
[02:53:49.469 --> 02:53:50.430]  Michael, you want to talk about that?
[02:53:50.850 --> 02:53:51.751]  Well, without question.
[02:53:51.791 --> 02:53:58.234]  I mean, basically it's looking on the most vulnerable people and taking advantage of their life by ending them.
[02:53:58.254 --> 02:53:58.294]  So...
[02:53:59.232 --> 02:54:01.734]  We can have... This is the whole agenda.
[02:54:01.854 --> 02:54:05.557]  Yeah, man, you're not in danger now when you're able to walk and talk and stand up for yourself.
[02:54:06.117 --> 02:54:06.878]  It's when you're hurt.
[02:54:07.258 --> 02:54:08.379]  It's when you're in their grips.
[02:54:08.759 --> 02:54:13.103]  You know, doctors and nurses just think it's nice to kill you, just like it's nice to cut a baby out.
[02:54:16.105 --> 02:54:18.607]  You see, because the bioethicists say you don't have value.
[02:54:18.627 --> 02:54:19.628]  That's true.
[02:54:19.808 --> 02:54:21.269]  They're doing you a favor.
[02:54:21.289 --> 02:54:21.489]  Yeah.
[02:54:23.089 --> 02:54:23.409]  That's right.
[02:54:23.429 --> 02:54:28.813]  The dehumanization of people is definitely the government's agenda when they do these kinds of things.
[02:54:28.833 --> 02:54:30.935]  Yeah, that's why they're on the news saying torture is good.
[02:54:30.955 --> 02:54:32.195]  Right.
[02:54:32.636 --> 02:54:35.318]  See, they're warping us, turning us into demons like they are.
[02:54:36.839 --> 02:54:41.482]  Bush's number two lawyer, John Eustace, says they can torture children in front of their parents sexually.
[02:54:41.502 --> 02:54:42.122]  Yeah.
[02:54:42.803 --> 02:54:45.585]  And he was asked about it at a CFR meeting, and he said yes.
[02:54:47.466 --> 02:54:48.287]  Thank you for the call.
[02:54:48.967 --> 02:54:51.549]  Isn't that a new level of evil, Michael Markavich?
[02:54:52.153 --> 02:54:52.854]  Well, without question.
[02:54:52.894 --> 02:55:01.580]  I mean, in the news we saw some examples of nurses that are actually going around and putting to death people who were not even terminally ill, who had some kind of disability.
[02:55:01.640 --> 02:55:05.844]  And this whole mindset is definitely taking over in our government.
[02:55:05.944 --> 02:55:15.071]  And with some of the new research they're doing, they think that they can take fertilized babies and then kill them for research.
[02:55:15.151 --> 02:55:16.232]  I mean, that whole mindset.
[02:55:16.292 --> 02:55:18.133]  And then they call it stem cell.
[02:55:18.914 --> 02:55:20.755]  Richard in Connecticut, you've got about 45 seconds.
[02:55:20.775 --> 02:55:21.316]  Go ahead, Richard.
[02:55:22.026 --> 02:55:22.486]  Right, man.
[02:55:22.506 --> 02:55:32.234]  First of all, it's an honor to speak with you and just want to say that I hope that things get better and not worse as far as the babies thing you're talking about.
[02:55:33.434 --> 02:55:37.978]  I have some friends of mine that have some learning disabilities too.
[02:55:38.198 --> 02:55:44.863]  Maybe as far as learning disabilities are concerned, maybe we got some time and maybe we can derail this whole program.
[02:55:46.454 --> 02:55:46.954]  I hear you.
[02:55:47.234 --> 02:55:49.715]  Michael, give us updates as things develop.
[02:55:49.755 --> 02:55:52.015]  We can check those out at RepentAmerica.com.
[02:55:52.315 --> 02:55:53.156]  Thank you for joining us.
[02:55:53.436 --> 02:55:54.036]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:55:54.516 --> 02:55:55.096]  God bless you.
[02:55:55.236 --> 02:55:55.656]  God bless you.
[02:55:56.036 --> 02:55:56.556]  It's simple.
[02:55:56.596 --> 02:56:00.397]  You don't stand up for the Iraqi children, for babies in this country, for unborn babies.
[02:56:00.417 --> 02:56:01.497]  You don't stand for anybody.
[02:56:02.017 --> 02:56:02.638]  It's real simple.
[02:56:03.598 --> 02:56:06.698]  And a lot of you are wedded to abortion because you've had one or been part of one.
[02:56:06.718 --> 02:56:07.659]  Look, God will forgive you.
[02:56:08.159 --> 02:56:09.799]  What God doesn't like is that hard heart.
[02:56:11.379 --> 02:56:13.640]  You'll feel a lot better if you just repent.
[02:56:14.531 --> 02:56:24.662]  Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof or abridging the freedom of speech of the press or the right of people to peacefully assemble and petition the government for a redress of grievances.
