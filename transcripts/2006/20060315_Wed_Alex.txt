[00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:06.261]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.921 --> 00:00:07.981]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.681 --> 00:00:09.821]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.442 --> 00:00:11.262]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.022 --> 00:00:12.922]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.582 --> 00:00:17.283]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.763 --> 00:00:21.844]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:39.147 --> 00:00:40.450]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:48.620]  Folks listening all across the world and the ships at sea, it is Wednesday, the 15th day of March 2006.
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.421]  We'll be live here for the next three hours, and I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:00:53.902 --> 00:01:02.063]  Former NSA lawyer Jonathan Hurley at Conyers NSA whitewash hearings says Bush committed a crime.
[00:01:02.163 --> 00:01:02.863]  Well, no kidding.
[00:01:02.883 --> 00:01:04.144]  We know what the federal law is.
[00:01:04.164 --> 00:01:05.044]  We don't need to be told.
[00:01:05.604 --> 00:01:06.605]  I think we're good to go.
[00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:38.400]  I hope they don't kill me and then claim that I killed myself.
[00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:40.181]  They're so good at doing that.
[00:01:40.581 --> 00:01:44.002]  Saddam's microphone was cut after he suggests U.S.
[00:01:44.082 --> 00:01:45.242]  behind bombings.
[00:01:45.662 --> 00:01:46.963]  That's how free his trial is.
[00:01:47.003 --> 00:01:48.203]  He's not allowed a defense.
[00:01:48.223 --> 00:01:48.803]  That's out of the AP.
[00:01:50.925 --> 00:01:53.087]  And again, Saddam's silence for fingering U.S.
[00:01:53.407 --> 00:01:54.748]  in Iraq bombings.
[00:01:54.968 --> 00:01:57.870]  We know some of them are Western intelligence agencies.
[00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:02.513]  Again, do the big corporations make more money over their six months or over their 20 years?
[00:02:02.713 --> 00:02:03.493]  You know the answer.
[00:02:04.014 --> 00:02:10.178]  Civil war is in the official Pentagon battle plans, Israeli official plans, and the PNAC neocon battle plans.
[00:02:11.118 --> 00:02:14.160]  Going back to Slobo, Russian lawmakers call for closure of U.N.
[00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:15.661]  tribunal over Milosevic death.
[00:02:15.681 --> 00:02:16.942]  We'll get more into that.
[00:02:18.603 --> 00:02:18.963]  Internet...
[00:02:20.661 --> 00:02:26.002]  Is basically taking over from the old line establishment media.
[00:02:26.022 --> 00:02:33.784]  And that's why the globalists are panicking, trying to come in to regulate and tax and control the net.
[00:02:33.824 --> 00:02:36.185]  Here's the headline out of the London Guardian.
[00:02:36.225 --> 00:02:38.346]  The Associated Press picked up a similar headline.
[00:02:38.886 --> 00:02:43.847]  Internet means end for media barons, says Rupert Murdoch.
[00:02:44.347 --> 00:02:47.188]  Magnet hails second great age of discovery.
[00:02:47.828 --> 00:02:50.569]  Power moving from the old elite to the bloggers.
[00:02:51.169 --> 00:03:05.835]  Rupert Murdoch last night sounded the death knell for the era of the media baron comparing today's internet pioneers with explorers such as Christopher Columbus and John Cabot and hailing the arrival of a second great age of discovery.
[00:03:05.855 --> 00:03:06.555]  I'm going to get into that.
[00:03:07.305 --> 00:03:10.286]  And, of course, we hailed this several years ago with articles we wrote.
[00:03:10.906 --> 00:03:35.955]  I mean, when I can start a website in a few months, have it be bigger than, say, the Austin American Statesman, a hundred-and-something-year-old newspaper's website, when I can have websites that now rival the size of the Dallas Morning News, and I don't have near the biggest freedom websites, truth-telling websites, whatever you want to call them, there are just hundreds and hundreds of gigantic ones bigger than most major newspapers.
[00:03:36.584 --> 00:03:37.124]  We're good to go.
[00:04:04.628 --> 00:04:06.369]  You know, people want reality.
[00:04:06.749 --> 00:04:08.250]  They want to hear the truth.
[00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:10.191]  They already know the truth in their guts.
[00:04:10.251 --> 00:04:12.452]  It's terrorists run this government.
[00:04:13.872 --> 00:04:14.593]  But let me tell you something.
[00:04:14.613 --> 00:04:15.733]  We're not out of the woods yet.
[00:04:16.954 --> 00:04:18.514]  And they're playing possum right now.
[00:04:18.554 --> 00:04:21.356]  And, oh, I'm going to break down Internet, too, what they're really planning.
[00:04:21.396 --> 00:04:23.177]  And don't worry.
[00:04:23.197 --> 00:04:25.538]  They're not about to give up their power without a fight.
[00:04:26.258 --> 00:04:28.379]  And if A-bombs need to be involved, they will be.
[00:04:29.019 --> 00:04:29.379]  Oh, yes.
[00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:30.160]  Oh, yes.
[00:04:30.902 --> 00:04:32.362]  So we'll go over this a little bit.
[00:04:32.382 --> 00:04:33.983]  But we are kicking their teeth in.
[00:04:34.023 --> 00:04:35.463]  We're knocking their teeth out.
[00:04:35.843 --> 00:04:37.863]  We're pounding their eyes into their skulls.
[00:04:38.204 --> 00:04:39.424]  We're stomping their heads.
[00:04:39.444 --> 00:04:40.604]  We're putting the boots to them.
[00:04:41.684 --> 00:04:43.265]  We're putting the boots to them right now.
[00:04:43.585 --> 00:04:45.785]  They can't win in a fair fight in the Infowar.
[00:04:46.005 --> 00:04:50.006]  That's why these sickos are going to turn a city into a slag heap.
[00:04:50.426 --> 00:04:51.326]  You just watch.
[00:04:52.146 --> 00:04:53.667]  Unless we really get the word out.
[00:04:53.747 --> 00:04:54.387]  Stay with me.
[00:04:54.427 --> 00:04:55.027]  Stay with me.
[00:04:55.267 --> 00:04:56.147]  Strap yourselves in.
[00:05:02.222 --> 00:05:05.163]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[00:05:05.823 --> 00:05:07.124]  Alex Jones here, America.
[00:05:07.324 --> 00:05:13.065]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest, most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[00:05:13.345 --> 00:05:18.587]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[00:05:18.887 --> 00:05:23.048]  Brace yourselves as the New World Order program for world domination is blown wide open.
[00:05:23.208 --> 00:05:26.989]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world, where the military and the police are merged.
[00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:31.871]  Witnesses' populations beg for national ID cards, and yes, even implantable microchips.
[00:05:31.971 --> 00:05:38.214]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies, psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.
[00:05:38.274 --> 00:05:40.134]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.
[00:05:40.575 --> 00:05:42.675]  Order 911 The Road to Tyranny today.
[00:05:42.756 --> 00:05:47.037]  Call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[00:05:47.097 --> 00:05:49.158]  That's 1-888-253-3139.
[00:05:49.899 --> 00:05:54.260]  Or order online at infowars.com or infowars.net.
[00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:56.401]  You see big brothers afraid of this documentary.
[00:05:56.621 --> 00:05:58.142]  Order today and spread the word.
[00:05:58.322 --> 00:06:00.403]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.
[00:06:01.593 --> 00:06:03.194]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:06:03.334 --> 00:06:07.456]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[00:06:07.576 --> 00:06:10.438]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[00:06:10.538 --> 00:06:17.221]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[00:06:17.421 --> 00:06:20.426]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[00:06:20.646 --> 00:06:23.030]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:33.285]  Like murky elements, not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as atrazine, benzene, chloride, and chloroform.
[00:06:33.605 --> 00:06:35.986]  Or order on the web at murkywater.com.
[00:07:02.051 --> 00:07:07.674]  Did you know that business opportunity seekers worldwide are discovering the powerful opportunities in foreign exchange trading?
[00:07:08.075 --> 00:07:12.277]  In Forex, there are no employees, advertising, products, or organizations to build.
[00:07:12.677 --> 00:07:14.919]  It's just you, the internet, and your computer.
[00:07:15.479 --> 00:07:20.102]  With specialized personal training, you too will be able to make big money in the world's largest market.
[00:07:20.422 --> 00:07:25.525]  If you're searching for an alternative to more traditional home-based business opportunities, then Forex trading is for you.
[00:07:26.152 --> 00:07:34.177]  The $2 trillion a day Forex currency exchange market offers exciting opportunities in volatile times when other markets are unstable and insecure.
[00:07:34.717 --> 00:07:42.382]  This powerful Forex training program will teach you how risk can be managed very advantageously to minimize the downside while still maximizing the upside potential.
[00:07:43.010 --> 00:07:44.390]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:07:44.450 --> 00:07:45.631]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.828 --> 00:08:19.168]  There's a new study out.
[00:08:19.188 --> 00:08:24.530]  The New York Times reports chips and ID tags are vulnerable to viruses.
[00:08:27.371 --> 00:08:31.492]  Condoleezza Rice says that the terrorists want a, quote, ring of fire.
[00:08:31.512 --> 00:08:35.013]  If we don't give up all our rights to them, that's terrorism.
[00:08:35.353 --> 00:08:37.533]  Something bad's going to happen if you don't do what we say.
[00:08:37.593 --> 00:08:38.634]  That's terrorism.
[00:08:39.774 --> 00:08:43.375]  And at the same time, Rumsfeld hints that Iraq troop levels may rise.
[00:08:43.991 --> 00:08:46.613]  At their height, they were 170,000, went down to 135,000.
[00:08:46.713 --> 00:08:49.815]  They're now back up to 165,000.
[00:08:50.175 --> 00:08:54.579]  They may have to go up even higher because things are going so well over there.
[00:08:55.459 --> 00:08:56.600]  This came out over the weekend.
[00:08:56.620 --> 00:08:58.321]  I never covered it, but I'm going to today.
[00:08:58.501 --> 00:09:04.846]  SAS soldier quits army in disgust at, quote, illegal American tactics in Iraq.
[00:09:05.769 --> 00:09:16.176]  A federal judge chastised the government yesterday for staging the trial of Zacharias Misali, coaching witnesses, engaging in lying or perjury.
[00:09:16.216 --> 00:09:18.537]  But he says, that's okay, you're just in trouble.
[00:09:18.938 --> 00:09:23.721]  I won't let you have the death penalty for Zacharias Misali now, but I'm not going to have a mistrial.
[00:09:23.781 --> 00:09:28.203]  He can go ahead and go to federal prison, even though you've staged everything.
[00:09:29.484 --> 00:09:32.126]  So I guess they'll get their one conviction of one of these patsies.
[00:09:33.237 --> 00:09:34.679]  So we'll get into that a lot more.
[00:09:34.719 --> 00:09:43.867]  Before I do that, let me just read what Rupert Murdoch said yesterday to a group of media barons.
[00:09:44.108 --> 00:09:48.972]  Headline, Internet means end for media barons, says Murdoch.
[00:09:50.033 --> 00:09:52.716]  Magnet hails second great age of discovery.
[00:09:53.277 --> 00:09:55.719]  Power moving from the old elite to the bloggers.
[00:09:56.613 --> 00:10:11.540]  Rupert Murdoch last night shouted the death knell for the era of the media baron, comparing today's internet pioneers with explorers such as Christopher Columbus and John Cabot, inhaling the arrival of a second great age of discovery.
[00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:12.900]  Yes, the change is happening now.
[00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:17.062]  Dwarf, the Gutenberg printing press.
[00:10:18.843 --> 00:10:21.464]  The News Corp media magnate,
[00:10:22.262 --> 00:10:25.163]  Nurtures a long-held distaste for the establishment.
[00:10:25.203 --> 00:10:26.524]  This is such propaganda.
[00:10:26.984 --> 00:10:35.427]  But last night confided to one of the few clubs to which he does belong, the worshipful company of stationers and newspaper makers.
[00:10:36.047 --> 00:10:38.348]  That's actually what it's called in the Masonic title.
[00:10:38.668 --> 00:10:41.669]  That he may be among the last of a dying breed.
[00:10:41.769 --> 00:10:43.050]  They're worshipful, you see.
[00:10:43.990 --> 00:10:51.313]  Power is moving away from the old elite in our industry, the editors, the chief executives, and let's face it, the proprietors.
[00:10:52.583 --> 00:10:54.343]  A new generation of media consumers has arisen.
[00:11:17.968 --> 00:11:28.918]  Demanding content delivered when they want it, how they want it, and very much as they want it, he said, indicating he had little desire to slow down despite his advancing years.
[00:11:29.218 --> 00:11:32.441]  He told the 603-year-old Guild, the worshipful, that he was looking forward, not back.
[00:11:37.387 --> 00:11:48.374]  It is difficult, indeed dangerous, to underestimate the huge changes this revolution will bring, or the power of developing technologies to build and destroy not just companies, but whole countries.
[00:11:48.894 --> 00:11:51.736]  Oh, not whole countries.
[00:11:52.717 --> 00:12:00.781]  The owner of Fox News added, Never has the flow of information and ideas of hard news and reasoned comment been more important.
[00:12:00.821 --> 00:12:07.104]  The force of our democratic beliefs is a key weapon in the war against religious fanaticism and the terror it breeds.
[00:12:07.124 --> 00:12:08.284]  All right, let me just stop right there.
[00:12:11.346 --> 00:12:13.306]  Total spin, okay?
[00:12:13.867 --> 00:12:16.248]  They're trying to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat.
[00:12:17.068 --> 00:12:20.770]  About two weeks ago, a new book came out,
[00:12:21.962 --> 00:12:26.625]  By one of Karl Rove's biographers, by Neocon.
[00:12:26.705 --> 00:12:28.966]  I'm not even going to plug or give it attention, but it was on Drudge.
[00:12:29.206 --> 00:12:29.786]  We posted it.
[00:12:29.807 --> 00:12:34.689]  It was just so ridiculous, I didn't spend any time on it, but it's important now.
[00:12:34.789 --> 00:12:45.295]  Remember, Bush is happy, old-line media dying, hails the blogs, hails the alternative media, says that it supports him.
[00:12:46.511 --> 00:13:04.379]  The alternative media, I mean libertarian, old-line, paleo, conservative, and liberal and ultra-liberal, to use the false paradigm terms that are still in use, just so we can communicate with some new listeners, is almost universally, rabidly Bush-hating.
[00:13:04.559 --> 00:13:05.680]  I mean, just frothing.
[00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:08.561]  Because a lot of them don't understand Bush is just a puppet.
[00:13:08.941 --> 00:13:09.842]  I can't stand him either.
[00:13:10.362 --> 00:13:10.462]  But...
[00:13:11.994 --> 00:13:19.723]  There are, I mean, even World Net Daily and Newsmax have to attack Bush now routinely and then try to apologize for him and just say he's an idiot.
[00:13:21.325 --> 00:13:23.087]  I mean, no one is supporting him.
[00:13:23.728 --> 00:13:27.712]  No one except for brain-dead, maybe Free Republic posters.
[00:13:27.772 --> 00:13:29.274]  I mean, it just doesn't exist.
[00:13:30.186 --> 00:13:47.217]  All the gun grabbing, the open border promoting, the ports deals, the government growing faster than ever, more money spent than all presidents before him combined, just bankrupting the currency, trying to push the free trade area of America, signing back on to UNESCO.
[00:13:47.237 --> 00:13:48.758]  I mean, the list goes on for hours.
[00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:54.562]  But Bush has the nerve, and I've seen them all now.
[00:13:54.622 --> 00:13:59.385]  All the neocons are out spouting, including Murdoch, one of their chieftains, Rothschild front boy.
[00:14:00.123 --> 00:14:00.704]  We're good to go.
[00:14:00.724 --> 00:14:00.964]  I think?
[00:14:20.822 --> 00:14:22.742]  They're all out there saying, oh, man, we're winning.
[00:14:22.983 --> 00:14:26.143]  The alternative media, yay, we're winning, yeah!
[00:14:26.503 --> 00:14:27.604]  All right!
[00:14:27.884 --> 00:14:33.585]  Alternative media loves George W. And that's just putting perfume on a pig.
[00:14:33.665 --> 00:14:45.048]  It's like when you catch somebody inside your house robbing you with their hands on your wife's jewels inside your safe, and they turn and say, oh, I saw someone run out of your house, and I was putting it back for you.
[00:14:45.068 --> 00:14:46.028]  Do I get a reward?
[00:14:48.255 --> 00:14:49.277]  I mean, that's all this is.
[00:14:49.317 --> 00:14:49.937]  They've been caught.
[00:14:50.158 --> 00:14:51.119]  They've been caught lying.
[00:14:51.139 --> 00:14:52.941]  They've been caught being on government payroll.
[00:14:53.141 --> 00:14:54.763]  They've been caught selling out America.
[00:14:54.983 --> 00:15:01.872]  They've been caught taking billions in Pentagon and government money to put billions to put out lies.
[00:15:01.912 --> 00:15:02.733]  Not liberal lies.
[00:15:02.753 --> 00:15:03.694]  Not conservative lies.
[00:15:04.034 --> 00:15:05.997]  World government empire lies.
[00:15:07.017 --> 00:15:13.559]  And they tried to give us fake left-right paradigms and get us, oh, Russia's real, or, oh, Al Franken's real, or these Democrats will save us.
[00:15:13.579 --> 00:15:17.000]  And they tried to give you these two false choices owned by the same companies.
[00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:18.480]  And it just hasn't worked.
[00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:20.200]  People are very discerning.
[00:15:20.220 --> 00:15:34.584]  The larger and larger minority, and it will become a majority soon, has developed taste buds, has developed a palate, has developed a nose, has developed an ear, has developed a touch, has developed a sense for what's going on.
[00:15:35.817 --> 00:15:42.940]  I don't even have to defend myself when big major publications attack me or when low-level COINTELPRO operators on the web attack me because people know.
[00:15:43.020 --> 00:15:43.820]  They recognize it.
[00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:44.360]  They see it.
[00:15:44.580 --> 00:15:46.301]  You instinctively know now.
[00:15:46.581 --> 00:15:48.362]  It's very exciting.
[00:15:52.443 --> 00:15:56.785]  And so they're trying to run around and they're trying to put a good face on it.
[00:15:58.405 --> 00:16:03.107]  They're trying to claim that they've had some victory through their defeat.
[00:16:06.016 --> 00:16:09.737]  I mean, Fox has had, quote, the biggest ratings of cable TV.
[00:16:10.077 --> 00:16:12.878]  A few million people with three million tops on their biggest show.
[00:16:12.898 --> 00:16:16.619]  I mean, old line talk radio makes that look puny.
[00:16:19.060 --> 00:16:20.460]  Their media is all fractured.
[00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:23.981]  They're trying to supply all the different niches, all the different niches.
[00:16:24.614 --> 00:16:25.114]  We're good to go.
[00:16:49.742 --> 00:16:50.283]  We're good to go.
[00:17:09.801 --> 00:17:12.142]  People don't want plastic fruit, folks.
[00:17:12.162 --> 00:17:14.223]  They want a real apple, a real orange.
[00:17:14.423 --> 00:17:15.443]  They want real grapes.
[00:17:15.663 --> 00:17:17.224]  And you're going to get that right here.
[00:17:17.344 --> 00:17:21.106]  We're going to fill your belly up full of the truth, full of good information.
[00:17:21.266 --> 00:17:24.387]  And it feels good, and it tastes good, and you know it's real.
[00:17:24.587 --> 00:17:29.729]  And you know once you've tasted the truth, you know what they're giving you is a big, fat lie.
[00:17:34.551 --> 00:17:35.912]  You ate it, and it was good.
[00:17:36.152 --> 00:17:37.552]  You tasted it, it was good.
[00:17:37.912 --> 00:17:39.433]  What they're giving you isn't good.
[00:17:41.698 --> 00:17:47.563]  Now, I want to get into what their plans are to try to shut us down, what their plans are to try to stop us.
[00:17:49.545 --> 00:17:50.345]  Because they're panicking.
[00:17:51.026 --> 00:17:52.227]  They're going to try to knight.
[00:17:52.927 --> 00:18:08.060]  They have different, that is, designate, advocate, hand over their mantle to supposed mega-bloggers like Drudge and others, who they position at the forefront from the start.
[00:18:09.907 --> 00:18:18.730]  And they position these people as supposed alternative and try to get them to shop up all of the global visitors.
[00:18:19.130 --> 00:18:20.310]  That's not even working anymore.
[00:18:21.810 --> 00:18:26.132]  They try to give attention to all the fake left-wing blogs and all the fake right-wing blogs.
[00:18:26.472 --> 00:18:35.594]  When what's really exploding, you can go look at all the statistics online, the major rating services, it's anti-New World Order, death to the New World Order, we're going to bring down the New World Order.
[00:18:35.634 --> 00:18:37.315]  Those are the sites that are exploding.
[00:18:39.429 --> 00:18:46.834]  And specifically the sites that say focused on information and fighting the globalists, not co-and-telepro-ing each other and fighting with each other and ninnying.
[00:18:47.575 --> 00:18:48.476]  People don't want that.
[00:18:50.117 --> 00:18:52.218]  But that's only one small part of the program.
[00:18:57.062 --> 00:19:01.805]  They're attempting to buy up the alternative media.
[00:19:01.825 --> 00:19:06.629]  What, for $560-something million last year, Rupert Murdoch bought MySpace.
[00:19:08.085 --> 00:19:08.485]  40 million.
[00:19:08.545 --> 00:19:09.886]  It was 38 million a few months ago.
[00:19:09.926 --> 00:19:11.266]  Now it's 40 million members.
[00:19:11.967 --> 00:19:17.289]  I'm not saying there isn't a lot of cool stuff on there and you guys don't have nice web pages and, gee, it's a lot of fun to be part of this big community.
[00:19:17.829 --> 00:19:20.210]  The point is they'll erase your blog if they don't like it.
[00:19:20.570 --> 00:19:23.332]  The point is you don't own all the stuff you've put up there.
[00:19:23.692 --> 00:19:25.873]  The point is that it's like Internet 2.
[00:19:26.313 --> 00:19:31.075]  It has automatic censoring systems that go in and erase keywords.
[00:19:31.675 --> 00:19:34.416]  The point is that they're trying to contain it and...
[00:19:38.587 --> 00:19:43.570]  Sure, it's big and it's fun, but it leads into stagnation and destruction.
[00:19:43.870 --> 00:19:58.859]  I mean, I've been wrestling with the fact that people keep asking me to get a MySpace blog, and sure, we can do that, but just so I can send Rupert Murdoch money, and just so Rupert Murdoch can take it away from me anytime he wants, we'll be right back.
[00:20:01.525 --> 00:20:03.608]  Gee, honey, those new sandals look great on you.
[00:20:03.809 --> 00:20:06.052]  And look, they show off my new toenails, too.
[00:20:06.352 --> 00:20:07.013]  New toenails?
[00:20:07.394 --> 00:20:08.395]  What happened to the old ones?
[00:20:09.377 --> 00:20:12.041]  Well, they're not really new, just clear and healthy looking.
[00:20:12.597 --> 00:20:14.017]  Remember how embarrassed I was?
[00:20:14.037 --> 00:20:16.818]  They were so discolored, really awful looking.
[00:20:17.058 --> 00:20:18.439]  Well, they sure look clear now.
[00:20:18.859 --> 00:20:20.539]  Gosh, I wish I could wear sandals again.
[00:20:20.699 --> 00:20:22.060]  My toenails are a disaster.
[00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:24.920]  Look, this one looks white, and that one's thick and yellow.
[00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:26.381]  Well, here's my secret.
[00:20:26.941 --> 00:20:27.981]  Non-X Nail Gel.
[00:20:28.461 --> 00:20:32.542]  It clears out yellowing keratin debris, the source of nail discoloration.
[00:20:33.242 --> 00:20:34.143]  Ah, so that's it.
[00:20:34.403 --> 00:20:36.943]  I've got ugly keratin debris built up under my nails.
[00:20:37.224 --> 00:20:38.844]  And Non-X Nail Gel gets rid of it.
[00:20:39.344 --> 00:20:42.446]  Now, you'll need to use it every day, but clear nails are worth it.
[00:20:42.826 --> 00:20:43.366]  You bet.
[00:20:43.586 --> 00:20:47.688]  You know, when we go to the beach this summer, my toenails are going to look just as good as yours do.
[00:20:47.848 --> 00:20:49.389]  Thanks to Nonex Nail Gel.
[00:20:49.769 --> 00:20:50.910]  Nonex Nail Gel.
[00:20:51.070 --> 00:20:52.751]  For clear, healthy-looking nails.
[00:20:53.111 --> 00:20:58.213]  Now at Walgreens, Rite Aid, Eckerd, Brooks, Longs, Duane Reade, and Walmart.
[00:20:58.394 --> 00:20:59.574]  In the foot care section.
[00:21:01.975 --> 00:21:02.736]  Here it is, folks.
[00:21:02.916 --> 00:21:04.276]  The 2006 Red Book.
[00:21:04.837 --> 00:21:07.278]  The most comprehensive edition ever published.
[00:21:08.024 --> 00:21:11.666]  Midas Resources believes our clients should be as informed as possible.
[00:21:12.466 --> 00:21:13.907]  It includes the history of U.S.
[00:21:13.987 --> 00:21:18.088]  coins, the actual mintages, the grading standards.

[00:21:20.790 --> 00:21:22.831]  Protect yourself from fiat currencies.
[00:21:23.251 --> 00:21:24.731]  They are instruments of death.
[00:21:25.031 --> 00:21:27.092]  Feel the comfort and safety of real money.

[00:21:44.088 --> 00:21:44.148]  1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:01.363 --> 00:22:12.095]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.
[00:22:12.275 --> 00:22:19.823]  The revolutionary Berkey Light with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:22:20.083 --> 00:22:23.228]  Farmful or unwanted chemicals are reduced to below detectable levels.
[00:22:23.508 --> 00:22:29.256]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving the nutritional minerals your body needs.
[00:22:29.536 --> 00:22:35.705]  Made of durable Lexan, the material used in making bulletproof glass, the system is durable, rugged, and yet attractive.
[00:22:36.045 --> 00:22:39.948]  The Berkey light is transparent, so there is no guesswork when refilling the system.
[00:22:39.988 --> 00:22:41.869]  The water level is always visible.
[00:22:42.069 --> 00:22:48.013]  The rechargeable LED lighting system is beautiful as a nightlight and as necessary in emergency situations.
[00:22:48.253 --> 00:22:52.196]  Get the Berkey light, the transparent water filter, for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[00:23:01.906 --> 00:23:04.348]  David J. Smith for News Watch Magazine.
[00:23:05.128 --> 00:23:10.752]  Over the last 40 years, we've seen prayer and God thrown out of the schools by decisions of the U.S.
[00:23:10.773 --> 00:23:11.553]  Supreme Court.
[00:23:12.314 --> 00:23:16.617]  Yet on February 29, 1892, in an eyeing-nothing decision of the U.S.
[00:23:16.657 --> 00:23:20.279]  Supreme Court, America was declared a Christian nation.
[00:23:21.260 --> 00:23:26.464]  There is an ongoing assault on your First Amendment right of freedom of religion and freedom of assembly.
[00:23:27.290 --> 00:23:27.490]  That's 1-800-
[00:23:47.462 --> 00:23:47.722]  516-8736.
[00:23:51.205 --> 00:23:51.806]  Call now.
[00:23:51.946 --> 00:23:58.551]  Operators are standing by to receive your call for a free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[00:24:04.937 --> 00:24:08.380]  We've got Iraqi women for peace coming on the third hour.
[00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:11.022]  They've been through it, lived through the war.
[00:24:11.563 --> 00:24:13.705]  They're traveling the U.S., exposing what it's really like.
[00:24:14.460 --> 00:24:16.380]  Paul Craig Roberts joins us every few weeks now.
[00:24:16.420 --> 00:24:17.121]  He's a contributor.
[00:24:17.141 --> 00:24:19.661]  We really appreciate him being part of the show.
[00:24:19.721 --> 00:24:30.524]  Dr. Roberts, number two at Treasury, father of Reaganomics, talking about how we're going into dictatorship and how Bush is attempting to set up a Nazi-type system in America.
[00:24:31.504 --> 00:24:33.904]  He'll join us for 30 minutes coming up in the middle of the next hour.
[00:24:33.924 --> 00:24:36.265]  We'll have open phones here coming up in the next segment.
[00:24:37.905 --> 00:24:42.426]  But just in the few minutes we've got left in this short segment, let me get back into what's happening.
[00:24:42.446 --> 00:24:44.307]  The old line media is dying.
[00:24:45.567 --> 00:24:46.727]  Here's just a local example.
[00:24:46.767 --> 00:24:57.950]  We put an ad in the Chronicle, local paper, for job applicants for a new position that we've already filled here at Infowars.
[00:24:59.251 --> 00:25:00.511]  And we got about ten responses.
[00:25:01.500 --> 00:25:02.900]  Bad responses at that.
[00:25:03.481 --> 00:25:07.722]  We put a free ad on Craigslist and got over 200 by the time we shut it off.
[00:25:08.702 --> 00:25:12.083]  And after a few days, we took it down because it was so ridiculous.
[00:25:12.543 --> 00:25:15.083]  And these were good responses locally in Austin.
[00:25:16.764 --> 00:25:16.964]  See?
[00:25:17.604 --> 00:25:22.405]  But there's the Chronicle with all these arrogant people working there and all this money they make.
[00:25:22.505 --> 00:25:24.065]  Oh, the old YB still makes all the money.
[00:25:24.746 --> 00:25:25.486]  But it's a hoax.
[00:25:25.946 --> 00:25:26.526]  It's a hoax.
[00:25:27.666 --> 00:25:28.166]  The Statesman.
[00:25:28.186 --> 00:25:29.387]  We put ads on the Statesman before.
[00:25:29.407 --> 00:25:30.727]  You might get 30 responses.
[00:25:32.098 --> 00:25:33.279]  But you do something on the web?
[00:25:33.339 --> 00:25:33.699]  Hundreds.
[00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:36.261]  Again, the old line media is a hoax.
[00:25:36.321 --> 00:25:41.004]  Oh, they make tens of millions of dollars, even these, you know, quote, middle-sized city papers.
[00:25:41.985 --> 00:25:45.087]  And people all stoop and fetch and get so excited.
[00:25:45.107 --> 00:25:45.768]  People send me stuff.
[00:25:46.048 --> 00:25:48.049]  Oh, you were in the Washington Post, Alex.
[00:25:48.189 --> 00:25:49.390]  Oh, you were in the New York Times.
[00:25:49.810 --> 00:25:51.572]  Oh, you were in Vanity Fair.
[00:25:51.912 --> 00:25:52.932]  Oh, don't you feel big?
[00:25:52.952 --> 00:25:54.133]  And I'm like, no, I don't feel big.
[00:25:54.333 --> 00:25:55.254]  Nobody reads that.
[00:25:55.975 --> 00:26:00.858]  My website gets plugged in Vanity Fair three times, and I get a few emails and
[00:26:01.807 --> 00:26:02.528]  That's about it.
[00:26:03.208 --> 00:26:13.336]  But I go on some little local Christian radio talk show in Florida or Alabama or Tennessee and we get 50 video orders and tens of thousands of visitors to the website.
[00:26:13.736 --> 00:26:25.525]  Because let me tell you something, mainstream media, people don't trust you and they don't like you and I don't think you realize just how much we don't like you and just how much we don't trust you.
[00:26:29.442 --> 00:26:30.843]  And I am just so sick of it.
[00:26:30.883 --> 00:26:32.143]  So how are they going to try to take us down?
[00:26:32.163 --> 00:26:39.387]  Well, they're going to try to put out little fake bloggers and disinfo people and put out their little whitewashed brands of gatekeepers.
[00:26:39.827 --> 00:26:41.507]  Number one, that's not the biggest.
[00:26:41.548 --> 00:26:43.268]  Number two, they're going to try to buy them up.
[00:26:43.608 --> 00:26:46.370]  Buy up the MySpaces, buy up the other big...
[00:26:48.659 --> 00:26:54.763]  Areas that are free flow of information and then automatically install censorship software, which is now being engaged in.
[00:26:55.183 --> 00:26:57.745]  And then advertise it as the trendiest, coolest thing to do.
[00:26:57.765 --> 00:27:05.350]  Instead of people going and creating their own independent systems, a lot of people will go along with that and live under censorship.
[00:27:05.370 --> 00:27:08.932]  And what Murdoch's done with MySpace is Internet, too.
[00:27:09.653 --> 00:27:12.695]  There are going to be about 50 major domain names.
[00:27:12.715 --> 00:27:15.377]  They're going to shut down the old Internet peer-to-peer networks.
[00:27:15.397 --> 00:27:16.417]  They're already getting ready to do that.
[00:27:16.457 --> 00:27:17.278]  This has been announced.
[00:27:18.129 --> 00:27:29.352]  Then they're going to force everyone over, quote, to the new Internet that's going to work, but under it you'll have to sign agreements that you can be tracked and traced, won't have any free speech rights, and we'll have a sub-web page on a major domain.
[00:27:30.512 --> 00:27:35.153]  And it starts with 50 major companies, and some of them are private universities.
[00:27:35.433 --> 00:27:36.374]  That is official.
[00:27:36.414 --> 00:27:37.714]  Type in, the Internet is dead.
[00:27:38.074 --> 00:27:43.795]  You'll get Internet 2 meeting in Austin last year, Internet meeting two years ago in London, and you'll see the big execs saying it.
[00:27:43.875 --> 00:27:44.596]  That's their plan.
[00:27:44.996 --> 00:27:46.196]  See, they can't beat us.
[00:27:46.756 --> 00:27:52.879]  So they're just going to shut the old web down and force us onto stuff like MySpace, which is going to be part of the Internet, too.
[00:27:53.339 --> 00:28:01.583]  So the Internet peer-to-peer failures you've seen the last year, where whole areas of the net are shut down for weeks and you can't get to them, that's just a test salvo.
[00:28:02.164 --> 00:28:03.784]  Now, they can't stop the free market.
[00:28:03.804 --> 00:28:08.827]  If you demand your old, which is really the new, the upgraded free open net...
[00:28:10.282 --> 00:28:11.022]  Then you'll get it.
[00:28:11.623 --> 00:28:16.165]  But if Congress and the internationalists, the EU, is on the verge of passing a law that will affect the U.S.
[00:28:16.205 --> 00:28:22.329]  for taxes of all emails, about a penny apiece, regulation of free speech, it's all happening.
[00:28:22.349 --> 00:28:25.011]  The ADL and others are busy pushing it in Congress.
[00:28:25.951 --> 00:28:27.112]  There's a host of things happening.
[00:28:27.132 --> 00:28:32.655]  So they're buying it up, putting out fake bloggers and COINTELPRO people that attack good patriots.
[00:28:33.235 --> 00:28:35.997]  And at the same time, if we're not to recognize this,
[00:28:37.285 --> 00:28:46.508]  At the same time, they're just changing the architecture of the Internet itself to force you into subdomains where, oh, you've got free speech on the web, but nobody can get to your site.
[00:28:47.788 --> 00:28:58.992]  Go sign the user agreement with MySpace, and sure, we've got some software spiders that come in and erase any words like freedom, or China's bad, or Rupert Murdoch's bad.
[00:28:59.212 --> 00:29:00.572]  You see, that's all starting now.
[00:29:01.453 --> 00:29:02.573]  That's in the news every day.
[00:29:04.004 --> 00:29:12.631]  You think Google censoring stuff in China and Yahoo censoring stuff in China for the Chinese government, words like Tiananmen Square and freedom, well, it's going to get a lot worse here.
[00:29:13.772 --> 00:29:14.172]  Okay?
[00:29:14.772 --> 00:29:15.793]  And they're just doing it.
[00:29:16.213 --> 00:29:23.118]  We've already caught Google pulling it on some big mainline sites that are reporting on different defense activities, like space war and others.
[00:29:26.221 --> 00:29:26.401]  So...
[00:29:27.495 --> 00:29:28.776]  We're not out of the woods yet.
[00:29:28.836 --> 00:29:36.622]  You don't think all these big newspaper barons and the rest of them, when they all go to Internet 2 summits and conventions, I mean, they get up and give speeches.
[00:29:36.642 --> 00:29:37.783]  This is their business plan.
[00:29:38.023 --> 00:29:44.367]  They're going to try to take our Internet away from us with taxes and regulation and buying us up and shutting down the backbone.
[00:29:45.088 --> 00:29:49.351]  They're just going to take our highways and make them toll roads, just like they're doing with the real roads.
[00:29:51.713 --> 00:29:52.653]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.094 --> 00:29:54.595]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.602 --> 00:29:58.274]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.014 --> 00:30:06.656]  According to the American Diabetes Association, more than 18 million people in the U.S.
[00:30:06.696 --> 00:30:07.456]  have diabetes.
[00:30:07.756 --> 00:30:14.699]  Most people with diabetes have risk factors such as obesity, high blood pressure, and cholesterol, which increase their risk for heart disease.
[00:30:14.859 --> 00:30:19.381]  For example, more than 65% of people with diabetes die from heart disease or stroke.
[00:30:19.581 --> 00:30:22.402]  Finding out you or your loved ones have diabetes can be scary.
[00:30:22.542 --> 00:30:29.485]  This is why, as your trusted online partner in health, we are committed to bringing you products that help you make informed decisions about your health
[00:30:29.765 --> 00:30:39.071]  At ResearchedHerbs.com, you can learn more about LeucoCare, a highly effective and safe natural herbal supplement formulated specifically to help maintain optimal blood sugar levels.
[00:30:39.372 --> 00:30:48.758]  As with all products featured on ResearchedHerbs.com, LeucoCare is the result of several years of rigorous development and is backed by numerous clinical trials and experimental studies.
[00:30:49.038 --> 00:30:51.800]  Visit us online at ResearchedHerbs.com or call 1-800-845-3841 to learn more.
[00:30:51.820 --> 00:30:52.340]  That's 1-800-845-3841.
[00:31:01.676 --> 00:31:07.920]  The illuminated Berkey base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[00:31:08.060 --> 00:31:14.223]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[00:31:14.504 --> 00:31:22.949]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[00:31:23.189 --> 00:31:30.213]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter, and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[00:31:30.513 --> 00:31:35.336]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[00:31:35.556 --> 00:31:40.960]  The Berkey base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[00:31:41.300 --> 00:31:44.382]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[00:31:44.723 --> 00:31:52.668]  Get the illuminated Berkey base for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:31:52.728 --> 00:31:53.308]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[00:32:01.374 --> 00:32:05.438]  People who use Cardivite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[00:32:05.638 --> 00:32:09.041]  For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself time-tested.
[00:32:09.222 --> 00:32:12.705]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite.
[00:32:12.958 --> 00:32:16.200]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[00:32:16.220 --> 00:32:21.702]  This basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the disease that we see.
[00:32:21.742 --> 00:32:31.367]  When we do our program, you know, herbal formulas like Cardavite, and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill now going for a regular job a few months later, we know we're doing something right.
[00:32:31.487 --> 00:32:32.807]  It's a well-thought-out formula.
[00:32:32.827 --> 00:32:38.270]  I mean, the idea of it working on yeast and metals both at the same time and liver function is dead on.
[00:32:38.770 --> 00:32:43.253]  You'll find, I think, that it'll work more than just on heart problems and circulation problems.
[00:32:43.293 --> 00:32:44.673]  It'll work on other problems as well.
[00:32:44.813 --> 00:32:48.856]  For more information, call 1-877-928-8822 or visit our website at www.heartdrop.com That toll-free number again?
[00:32:48.876 --> 00:32:48.936]  1-877-928-8822
[00:33:12.204 --> 00:33:19.830]  Another ragtag band declaring independence.
[00:33:19.890 --> 00:33:28.996]  They laid their bodies down in a bloody war for liberty.
[00:33:31.878 --> 00:33:33.159]  That's us, the descendants.
[00:33:33.719 --> 00:33:38.943]  I'm more than willing to lay my life down for my descendants.
[00:33:39.756 --> 00:33:40.837]  My progeny.
[00:33:42.277 --> 00:33:44.438]  If you don't have that instinct in you, you're not alive.
[00:33:44.458 --> 00:33:49.081]  You know, life is a beautiful, wonderful, precious, beautiful thing.
[00:33:49.101 --> 00:33:50.521]  There's so much good in the world.
[00:33:50.822 --> 00:33:54.123]  And I'm angry and I'm aggressive because I'm trying to defend that innocence.
[00:33:54.483 --> 00:33:55.904]  I'm trying to defend that beauty.
[00:33:55.924 --> 00:33:57.865]  You know, I love goodness.
[00:33:58.626 --> 00:34:00.106]  I really am a goody two-shoes.
[00:34:00.266 --> 00:34:03.608]  I love happiness and decency and good things.
[00:34:03.648 --> 00:34:09.091]  And I am shocked and amazed by the fact that our government can run child kidnapping rings and that it can be...
[00:34:10.071 --> 00:34:12.173]  In the Chicago Tribune that they're doing it.
[00:34:12.253 --> 00:34:13.233]  No one's going to get arrested.
[00:34:13.293 --> 00:34:14.354]  No one dare challenge them.
[00:34:14.634 --> 00:34:16.475]  And our government says they're above the law.
[00:34:16.715 --> 00:34:18.396]  And our government can bring in the narcotics.
[00:34:18.676 --> 00:34:20.878]  And all this bad stuff's going on.
[00:34:20.898 --> 00:34:24.920]  And that we sit here and are so naive, we can't admit it's going on.
[00:34:25.160 --> 00:34:28.822]  To defend the good, you've got to first learn to recognize the bad.
[00:34:30.803 --> 00:34:35.246]  Now, I know we've got... Oh, who's up first here in the calls?
[00:34:37.097 --> 00:34:44.984]  Russell and Evan and Kevin and many, many others, we're going to get to your calls, and I've got a bunch of news on the war and some new whitewash panel about the war.
[00:34:45.484 --> 00:34:48.587]  They call it an independent panel, and James Baker III is going to run it.
[00:34:49.167 --> 00:34:50.428]  I mean, top Bush lawyer.
[00:34:50.468 --> 00:34:51.249]  It's independent.
[00:34:51.309 --> 00:34:54.532]  I mean, it's like we're going to have Henry Kissinger for the 9-11 Commission.
[00:34:54.592 --> 00:35:00.937]  It's like saying we're going to have Heinrich Himmler at the War Crimes Tribunal overseeing the trial of Nazis.
[00:35:01.738 --> 00:35:03.920]  For those that don't know, he was the head of the dreaded S.S.,
[00:35:05.586 --> 00:35:06.887]  So we'll get into that just a lot more.
[00:35:06.927 --> 00:35:12.191]  And Paul Craig Roberts joins us in one hour, Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, and then Iraqi Women for Peace in the third hour.
[00:35:12.572 --> 00:35:13.492]  Your calls are coming up.
[00:35:13.512 --> 00:35:15.374]  But I've got to tell you something.
[00:35:16.075 --> 00:35:21.199]  We really try to support American-made products.
[00:35:21.579 --> 00:35:27.684]  My T-shirts are made right here in America.
[00:35:28.664 --> 00:35:31.606]  My dad was in my office last night, and I saw him looking up at the DVD boxes.
[00:35:31.727 --> 00:35:32.667]  It says, Made in China.
[00:35:33.148 --> 00:35:33.988]  And yes, it's true.
[00:35:35.149 --> 00:35:37.911]  The boxes that the DVDs go in are made in China.
[00:35:37.931 --> 00:35:47.999]  The DVDs themselves and the company that stamps them and burns them is made, what the discs are made in New Jersey, and they're stamped and made at a factory here in Austin.
[00:35:48.740 --> 00:35:55.105]  But in some cases, you just can't find products that are made in America.
[00:35:55.805 --> 00:35:57.567]  Again, we pay more than twice.
[00:35:59.012 --> 00:36:01.653]  What it would cost to have shirts made in Mexico, t-shirts.
[00:36:03.514 --> 00:36:05.855]  So we really tried to walk the walk.
[00:36:05.935 --> 00:36:09.937]  My dad didn't say anything last night, but I saw him looking because he hears the show and probably thinks I'm a hypocrite.
[00:36:11.677 --> 00:36:14.539]  But, you know, with the DVD cases.
[00:36:14.719 --> 00:36:17.080]  But again, we try as hard as we can.
[00:36:17.100 --> 00:36:22.482]  And it's a shame that we've gotten to the point that I can search and search but can't find...
[00:36:23.931 --> 00:36:25.753]  The classic DVD case.
[00:36:25.793 --> 00:36:30.195]  I'm sure I could find some little slipcover or something that looks like garbage that no one wants made in America.
[00:36:30.235 --> 00:36:33.958]  But it just shows how far we've gone.
[00:36:38.280 --> 00:36:52.349]  From the greatest manufacturer in the world to having a negative manufacturing base, from being the biggest savings country in the world to being the biggest debtors, corporate, private, and federal, and local.
[00:36:52.978 --> 00:36:53.459]  State level.
[00:36:54.280 --> 00:36:55.422]  And I'm not trying to be negative.
[00:36:55.762 --> 00:37:02.211]  It just really upsets me, and that's why I'm glad that New Millennium Concepts manufactures in America the Big Berkey, the Black Berkey.
[00:37:03.112 --> 00:37:07.598]  I'm glad that our videos are made here in America, my t-shirts are made here in America, and that's how we support ourselves.
[00:37:08.500 --> 00:37:10.182]  Plus, it's great information and gets the word out.
[00:37:11.440 --> 00:37:11.600]  And, uh...
[00:37:38.661 --> 00:37:41.825]  They sent us your supply because they were already sponsors of the network.
[00:37:42.205 --> 00:37:43.086]  Calvin Persub did.
[00:37:43.146 --> 00:37:43.566]  Marty did.
[00:37:43.586 --> 00:37:46.590]  A couple years ago, my wife, when it ran out, went and bought more.
[00:37:46.630 --> 00:37:48.231]  And she said, you ought to get them as a sponsor.
[00:37:48.732 --> 00:37:49.633]  This stuff's incredible.
[00:37:50.766 --> 00:37:54.028]  And it's triple concentrated, and you save about 85% off on average.
[00:37:54.068 --> 00:38:02.573]  So you end up paying more at the supermarket for toxic chemical-based... If you want to look at the research I've done on this and the research others have done, it's incredible how bad it is.
[00:38:02.894 --> 00:38:06.176]  Textile groups got together and had them put detergent in it because it eats holes in the clothes.
[00:38:06.396 --> 00:38:08.377]  Your clothes last longer, so you save money there, too.
[00:38:08.397 --> 00:38:17.903]  I mean, when something's made out of citrus and vegetable oil and coconut oil and almond oil, it's just so good.
[00:38:18.812 --> 00:38:23.976]  And my staff here, Barney just sent us another year's supply, and I gave it to the staff, and they're just, man, that isn't hype, Alex.
[00:38:24.016 --> 00:38:24.977]  That stuff's incredible.
[00:38:25.998 --> 00:38:31.342]  I mean, the way it cleans dishes, the way it cleans clothes, the way it smells in the shower, the shampoo, the bar soap.
[00:38:31.803 --> 00:38:37.167]  People got to my car, and I have a bar of it in the middle console, and it's all the way smells, and my buddy was laughing.
[00:38:37.187 --> 00:38:43.512]  Somebody's going to think you're snorting cocaine at a red light or huffing something, because I'll pull it out and just smell it, because I just love the smell.
[00:38:43.552 --> 00:38:44.153]  I'm not kidding.
[00:38:44.513 --> 00:38:48.296]  I don't drive around with a perfume bottle smelling, and I just like the way the soap smells, and
[00:38:49.293 --> 00:38:51.875]  When my allergies are getting up or something, I'll just kind of smell it.
[00:38:51.895 --> 00:38:52.936]  It just smells so good.
[00:38:53.196 --> 00:38:56.539]  I sound like a weirdo, but I'm really doing that, so I might as well just mention it.
[00:38:56.980 --> 00:39:00.563]  I mean, that's how good this Made in America product is.
[00:39:02.324 --> 00:39:05.667]  And Marty, the owner, family owned, his son works there.
[00:39:06.697 --> 00:39:09.358]  Passed on to the family for coming up on 60 years.
[00:39:09.898 --> 00:39:11.799]  Marty out in Oakland, California.
[00:39:11.939 --> 00:39:12.559]  Calbin.
[00:39:12.880 --> 00:39:14.360]  California Pure Soap Company, folks.
[00:39:14.400 --> 00:39:16.101]  CalbinPureSoap.com.
[00:39:16.201 --> 00:39:17.341]  Organic back in 1947.
[00:39:18.082 --> 00:39:19.302]  People didn't even know what that was.
[00:39:19.362 --> 00:39:21.003]  Go read the certificates on their website.
[00:39:21.423 --> 00:39:22.804]  Marty, thank you for joining us.
[00:39:22.824 --> 00:39:28.346]  Tell us about some of the special deals you've got from the $14 tote bag up to a four-year supply, brother.
[00:39:28.366 --> 00:39:29.886]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:39:29.906 --> 00:39:33.628]  You're a great American, and we appreciate sponsoring you.
[00:39:34.079 --> 00:39:40.101]  For what you have to say and do and work with, and there's very few people that do things like that.
[00:39:40.861 --> 00:39:48.523]  We are dedicated to save the environment with all Pure Soap products, verified earth-friendly.
[00:39:49.044 --> 00:39:53.725]  Save your skin from harsh, toxic, hazardous, poisonous store products.
[00:39:54.133 --> 00:39:55.013]  Save your air.
[00:39:55.233 --> 00:39:55.893]  Here's an example.
[00:39:55.933 --> 00:39:56.714]  I'm going to interrupt you.
[00:39:56.734 --> 00:39:58.094]  And I'm not kidding when I say this, folks.
[00:39:58.134 --> 00:39:59.114]  You know I don't hype things.
[00:39:59.814 --> 00:40:08.776]  In the past, with old-fashioned crud chemical soaps, yours is really the old-fashioned, I would wash under my arms, and if I left a little bit, it would chap and burn me.
[00:40:09.316 --> 00:40:14.477]  I can leave, cowbend, forget and leave it, you know, between my legs or under my arms, and it doesn't burn me.
[00:40:16.197 --> 00:40:17.557]  Pure soap shouldn't hurt.
[00:40:18.218 --> 00:40:19.038]  It shouldn't harm.
[00:40:19.458 --> 00:40:20.358]  It shouldn't pollute.
[00:40:20.942 --> 00:40:28.006]  It takes care of the environment by replenishing the earth, not destroying it and poisoning the earth.
[00:40:28.347 --> 00:40:30.408]  We've been dedicated to do that since 1947.
[00:40:32.029 --> 00:40:35.311]  My father and I, we're still the same family company.
[00:40:35.571 --> 00:40:36.912]  We're not a big corporation.
[00:40:37.232 --> 00:40:43.916]  We're a small, independent company that's fighting the giants, the billion-dollar chemical corporation.
[00:40:44.397 --> 00:40:44.857]  We know.
[00:40:45.478 --> 00:41:06.316]  We know from all the years of experience that we can save your hair from perfume chemical-laden dangerous shampoos, save your clothing from stronger-than-dirt cleaning chemicals, no more lint, save $1,000 tax-free cash per year from all the store-bought overpriced cleaning chemicals.
[00:41:06.756 --> 00:41:11.140]  Consumers not only like our soap, they love it, and we feel they don't
[00:41:11.533 --> 00:41:12.254]  They need it.
[00:41:12.474 --> 00:41:18.138]  They need it now to eliminate all those harsh, poisonous, toxic chemicals in the home.
[00:41:18.559 --> 00:41:35.452]  We have a sampler that's a six-pound sampler that has four bars of our pure soap, 16 ounces of our triple concentrated shampoo, 16 ounces, these are in dispenser bottles, of our liquid cream dish soap,
[00:41:36.699 --> 00:41:50.580]  18 ounces of our triple concentrated granulated laundry soap with a little tiny scoop, a book of instructions, how not only to use the products frugally, but all the other uses of the products.
[00:41:50.973 --> 00:41:55.895]  Making your window cleaner, making your floor cleaner, making your garage cleaner, making your hands cleaner.
[00:41:56.315 --> 00:42:00.257]  Everything that can be done with four basic products.
[00:42:00.417 --> 00:42:03.819]  Bath soap, hair soap, dish soap, laundry soap.
[00:42:03.839 --> 00:42:04.839]  Let me ask you a question.
[00:42:05.620 --> 00:42:07.180]  How much is that, Marty?
[00:42:07.641 --> 00:42:11.102]  $14 plus United Parcel to your door anywhere in the country.
[00:42:11.262 --> 00:42:13.563]  Marty, why does the bar soap smell so good?
[00:42:13.603 --> 00:42:15.984]  Everybody I know that smells it goes, what is that?
[00:42:16.645 --> 00:42:17.965]  We don't use perfumes.
[00:42:18.005 --> 00:42:19.546]  We use natural essences.
[00:42:20.234 --> 00:42:23.636]  Of cherries, of almonds, of lemons.
[00:42:24.256 --> 00:42:26.637]  All these are juices from oranges.
[00:42:27.218 --> 00:42:28.498]  Perfumes are toxic.
[00:42:28.598 --> 00:42:32.060]  Perfumes harm, itch, burn, tear.
[00:42:32.400 --> 00:42:33.321]  We don't believe in it.
[00:42:33.641 --> 00:42:37.983]  We're very stubborn, very old-fashioned, and very conservative.
[00:42:38.043 --> 00:42:43.506]  Well, Marty, I mean, my wife goes to Whole Foods and Central Market and occasionally buys, quote, their organic stuff, and it's okay.
[00:42:43.546 --> 00:42:44.527]  It's better than the chemicals, but...
[00:42:44.967 --> 00:42:45.468]  We're good to go.
[00:43:05.149 --> 00:43:09.313]  And Marty, I want to thank you for being a sponsor and being Made in America.
[00:43:32.612 --> 00:43:34.113]  And it's such a rare jewel.
[00:43:34.173 --> 00:43:43.199]  It's so unheard of to have your father, you, your son, now his children, coming up on 60 years at a company in America.
[00:43:43.639 --> 00:43:44.640]  I commend you, sir.
[00:43:45.020 --> 00:43:46.001]  I thank you for that.
[00:43:47.022 --> 00:43:47.862]  Well, it's amazing.
[00:43:48.443 --> 00:43:56.208]  And I just hope all the listeners avail themselves of your big color catalog for free or to at least get that $14 tote bag.
[00:43:56.728 --> 00:43:58.309]  How many bars does the soap come with that?
[00:43:58.649 --> 00:43:59.470]  Four bars.
[00:44:00.577 --> 00:44:02.319]  That alone costs more than $14.
[00:44:03.039 --> 00:44:04.000]  Oh, it's just amazing.
[00:44:04.020 --> 00:44:04.801]  It's just amazing.
[00:44:06.042 --> 00:44:07.163]  Again, folks, I'm not hyping this.
[00:44:07.183 --> 00:44:08.364]  Find out how great it is.
[00:44:08.664 --> 00:44:10.766]  Again, good stuff is always a great deal.
[00:44:11.146 --> 00:44:13.388]  And you always pay more for some toxic scam.
[00:44:13.448 --> 00:44:17.471]  It's just unbelievable how people still go along with the New World Order.
[00:44:17.491 --> 00:44:24.116]  1-800-340-7091 or CalvinPurcell.com Marty, we'll talk to you again real soon, my friend.
[00:44:24.297 --> 00:44:25.257]  Looking forward to it.
[00:44:25.377 --> 00:44:25.938]  God bless you.
[00:44:27.134 --> 00:44:32.076]  And folks, I know I get Marty up about once a month and have him on for about 10 minutes.
[00:44:32.616 --> 00:44:35.117]  And I appreciate the stations letting us do that and all the listeners.
[00:44:35.157 --> 00:44:36.098]  But it's just important.
[00:44:36.858 --> 00:44:38.059]  I mean, it's made in America.
[00:44:38.139 --> 00:44:39.139]  It's a great sponsor.
[00:44:39.159 --> 00:44:40.259]  It makes this show possible.
[00:44:40.600 --> 00:44:42.040]  And it's just such great stuff.
[00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:44.081]  So take advantage of it right now.
[00:44:44.581 --> 00:44:48.383]  All right, let's go to your calls, and I'll get back into all the other news.
[00:44:49.683 --> 00:44:51.984]  And I keep getting my call to scramble with all these calls.
[00:44:52.004 --> 00:44:53.025]  Who did you say was first again?
[00:44:54.565 --> 00:44:55.426]  Russell in Florida.
[00:44:55.446 --> 00:44:55.986]  Go ahead, sir.
[00:44:56.778 --> 00:44:57.298]  Hi, Alex.
[00:44:57.338 --> 00:44:59.359]  Just allow me to thank you for all you do, sir.
[00:44:59.699 --> 00:45:00.199]  Well, thank you.
[00:45:00.859 --> 00:45:08.462]  I'm convinced without people like you out there, and you've taken the forefront, we'd already be in chains, and I want to commend you and honor you, sir.
[00:45:08.542 --> 00:45:08.922]  Thank you.
[00:45:09.882 --> 00:45:11.103]  Alex, I've got a question.
[00:45:11.123 --> 00:45:20.546]  I'm calling with a heavy heart today, and I'm a little concerned about this month with the Iranian oil bourse and the M3 being changed, the money supply.
[00:45:20.866 --> 00:45:23.967]  They're no longer going to witness M3
[00:45:25.157 --> 00:45:29.021]  And then the price of gas seemingly skyrocketing, and there's really no reason.
[00:45:29.041 --> 00:45:33.805]  Do you feel, Alex, that there's going to be some state-sponsored attack or something that's going to take place?
[00:45:34.305 --> 00:45:35.847]  Do you feel that in your gut instincts?
[00:45:36.627 --> 00:45:40.391]  That is a huge shadow that always hangs over us.
[00:45:40.451 --> 00:45:41.632]  It's a dark pall.
[00:45:41.652 --> 00:45:44.334]  People ask me what pall means.
[00:45:44.394 --> 00:45:47.377]  It just means like a dark match hanging over people.
[00:45:48.297 --> 00:45:49.438]  We're good to go.
[00:46:06.572 --> 00:46:08.633]  We know that they're in deep trouble on every front.
[00:46:08.653 --> 00:46:09.593]  They're losing control.
[00:46:09.613 --> 00:46:23.777]  That's why they're so aggressive right now, is they know the people are getting wise to their shenanigans, to their machinations, to how they're trying to keelhaul this society, drag us around by our faces.
[00:46:24.797 --> 00:46:30.458]  But, you know, I don't know if the oil borscht is supposedly going to kick off the 28th.
[00:46:30.518 --> 00:46:32.079]  The elections in Israel are on the 28th.
[00:46:33.237 --> 00:46:34.980]  I think we're good to go.
[00:46:45.322 --> 00:46:47.143]  Bye-bye, you know, that guy, folks.
[00:46:47.803 --> 00:46:55.486]  And so I don't know what's going to happen, but I know they claimed they were going to attack Iraq in March of 2002, but Bilderberg had said it was really going to be March of 2003.
[00:46:55.906 --> 00:47:04.589]  They tend to like to constantly claim it's going to happen, going to happen, so we kind of accept it and expect it and somehow at a subconscious level want to see it happen.
[00:47:04.889 --> 00:47:09.911]  You know, we have this attitude to just get it over with, so they're wearing us out is what it's called.
[00:47:10.311 --> 00:47:11.612]  It's all basic psychology.
[00:47:12.426 --> 00:47:13.427]  But it could come today.
[00:47:13.827 --> 00:47:14.687]  Israel could strike them.
[00:47:14.727 --> 00:47:17.108]  Israel said last Friday, we're not doing enough.
[00:47:17.568 --> 00:47:24.132]  In the Jerusalem Post, the defense minister said, we're horrible, and we haven't attacked them yet, so they're going to have to attack.
[00:47:25.632 --> 00:47:29.634]  And then Iran will probably start attacking, or the global will have to blow something up and say they did it.
[00:47:31.135 --> 00:47:33.176]  Or if Iran fights back, oh, how dare them.
[00:47:33.716 --> 00:47:35.757]  So, yes, we're at a critical crossroads.
[00:47:36.117 --> 00:47:41.620]  Gas prices have gone up, what, 30 cents at the pump last month, and they're only going up higher now than that.
[00:47:42.532 --> 00:47:50.839]  And, you know, this oil bourse thing, I don't think that's all of it, but it does add credibility to the people that are pushing the oil bourse, saying that trading system will be the number one deal.
[00:47:51.280 --> 00:47:59.307]  Because, you know, two days ago, a bunch of Arab nations said they're going to start dumping the dollar for the euro, including UAE, over this.
[00:48:00.828 --> 00:48:02.990]  Well, we always know they like diversions, too.
[00:48:03.050 --> 00:48:04.331]  They're like magicians.
[00:48:04.351 --> 00:48:07.034]  You know, look at this hand while they're pulling a trick off with this hand.
[00:48:07.054 --> 00:48:08.535]  And they need a diversion.
[00:48:08.655 --> 00:48:09.536]  You know, we both...
[00:48:10.123 --> 00:48:17.608]  No, that the economy is getting ready to implode, or has been imploding, and they've been able to keep the public from really being aware of that.
[00:48:17.848 --> 00:48:18.328]  Exactly.
[00:48:18.368 --> 00:48:29.955]  They need to carry out an attack right around the time we tank, which Ron Paul and Craig Roberts and others have been saying, right when the economy tanks, they need to have a terror attack right at the time that they're going to let it happen.
[00:48:30.236 --> 00:48:34.078]  Then it's all psychologically blamed on the nebulous imaginary terrorist.
[00:48:34.781 --> 00:48:34.961]  Yeah.
[00:48:35.241 --> 00:48:37.182]  And then the globalists can profit-take all around us.
[00:48:37.522 --> 00:48:38.143]  Thanks for the call.
[00:48:38.183 --> 00:48:39.924]  Great points and great questions.
[00:48:40.264 --> 00:48:41.845]  Eben in Reno, Nevada.
[00:48:41.885 --> 00:48:42.725]  You're on the air, Eben.
[00:48:43.986 --> 00:48:44.286]  Alex.
[00:48:44.726 --> 00:48:45.046]  Yes, sir.
[00:48:46.047 --> 00:48:50.149]  Eben, it's ironic you were talking about Rupert's face today.
[00:48:51.710 --> 00:48:58.453]  I know that someone submitted that all the scripting on 9-11 Truth's personal profile had been deleted.
[00:48:58.473 --> 00:49:04.456]  I was actually on his top eight, but creepy Uncle Rupert deleted my whole account.
[00:49:05.080 --> 00:49:06.582]  Yeah, let me just tell you this.
[00:49:06.782 --> 00:49:10.445]  Every day or two, I get emails from listeners.
[00:49:10.525 --> 00:49:14.068]  Sometimes MySpace accounts, I visit it because there are some good blogs on there.
[00:49:15.410 --> 00:49:17.271]  And I go, and it's gone.
[00:49:17.892 --> 00:49:22.176]  And Murdoch bought it, what, eight, nine months ago, middle of last year.
[00:49:23.637 --> 00:49:25.559]  He bought it in the middle of 2005 for $564 million, to be precise.
[00:49:30.303 --> 00:49:35.045]  And now he's put all of News Corp's push behind it.
[00:49:35.085 --> 00:49:39.126]  It's grown even more from, what, 30 million when he bought it to now about 40 million members.
[00:49:40.787 --> 00:49:42.488]  And people are telling me, I've got to join.
[00:49:42.528 --> 00:49:43.268]  I've got to be part of it.
[00:49:43.528 --> 00:49:53.012]  Let me ask you, should we have one of my webmasters go build a site, get thousands of friends and members and promote it, and then just have them just take it?
[00:49:53.052 --> 00:49:55.573]  Should I go sign a contract with Murdoch saying, sure...
[00:49:56.693 --> 00:50:05.157]  I mean, you understand, folks, this is Internet, too, where you have to, in the future, you'll have to go under them, have to sign a contract with them to be on the web, and then they'll shut you down.
[00:50:05.397 --> 00:50:07.479]  They're shutting down most of the 9-11 sites.
[00:50:07.499 --> 00:50:09.600]  They're shutting down pro-Second Amendment sites.
[00:50:09.820 --> 00:50:11.581]  They're shutting down sites that bash Bush.
[00:50:11.801 --> 00:50:13.902]  They're shutting down sites that bash News Corp.
[00:50:14.502 --> 00:50:15.743]  I mean, it's despicable.
[00:50:17.163 --> 00:50:20.145]  I mean, we all talk about China censoring people.
[00:50:20.205 --> 00:50:21.265]  What about Rupert Murdoch?
[00:50:21.285 --> 00:50:22.066]  What do you say to that?
[00:50:22.306 --> 00:50:23.226]  I mean, what should I do?
[00:50:23.647 --> 00:50:24.627]  What should I do, James?
[00:50:25.227 --> 00:50:26.008]  I mean, Evan?
[00:50:26.964 --> 00:50:30.325]  I think you should maybe try another.
[00:50:30.866 --> 00:50:34.747]  I'm actually setting up an account on tagworld.com.
[00:50:34.987 --> 00:50:36.468]  You know, I just figured out what I'm going to do.
[00:50:36.508 --> 00:50:47.372]  I'm going to have my guys right now, today, we're going to set up a MySpace, and everybody else should do this, with its whole point being, will Rupert Murdoch shut this down?
[00:50:48.473 --> 00:50:51.654]  We're going to set up a MySpace exposing MySpace.
[00:50:52.791 --> 00:50:53.791]  You heard, gentlemen.
[00:50:54.331 --> 00:50:56.272]  Don't wait for orders from headquarters.
[00:50:56.312 --> 00:50:57.332]  Go to the sound of the guns.
[00:50:57.392 --> 00:50:57.772]  Stay there.
[00:50:57.792 --> 00:51:01.093]  And then I'll let you finish up.
[00:51:02.914 --> 00:51:05.754]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[00:51:06.014 --> 00:51:06.715]  Hello, my friends.
[00:51:06.815 --> 00:51:07.595]  Alex Jones here.
[00:51:07.935 --> 00:51:12.616]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law, 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[00:51:12.956 --> 00:51:19.678]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[00:51:20.018 --> 00:51:22.000]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[00:51:22.200 --> 00:51:25.042]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[00:51:25.142 --> 00:51:29.805]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[00:51:30.006 --> 00:51:34.409]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[00:51:34.649 --> 00:51:41.874]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[00:51:42.135 --> 00:51:44.556]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.

[00:54:01.698 --> 00:54:05.741]  We don't need no education.
[00:54:06.321 --> 00:54:07.342]  Genesis Network.
[00:54:08.243 --> 00:54:10.885]  We don't need River Murdoch censoring our blogs.
[00:54:13.186 --> 00:54:14.607]  We don't need no thought control.
[00:54:15.188 --> 00:54:17.389]  Yeah, when you get an account there, there's this big contract.
[00:54:17.429 --> 00:54:18.210]  Nobody reads it.
[00:54:19.591 --> 00:54:20.853]  I'm not attacking MySpace.
[00:54:20.893 --> 00:54:21.113]  Great.
[00:54:21.153 --> 00:54:22.655]  I'm glad 40 million of you are on it.
[00:54:22.675 --> 00:54:24.798]  I'm glad you say it's the hottest thing since sliced bread.
[00:54:24.838 --> 00:54:26.079]  It's easy to post on.
[00:54:26.119 --> 00:54:26.560]  It's great.
[00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:31.466]  The problem is that there's a creature named Rupert Murdoch who's as new world order as it gets.
[00:54:32.327 --> 00:54:34.789]  Who is running around censoring stuff.
[00:54:34.809 --> 00:54:40.554]  He has thousands of little moles that work at MySpace that are in there moderating and shutting everybody down.
[00:54:40.574 --> 00:54:41.395]  So we're going to do a test.
[00:54:41.415 --> 00:54:43.416]  I've got people already on it out there.
[00:54:43.456 --> 00:54:46.259]  We're going to post the news about Murdoch censoring it.
[00:54:46.279 --> 00:54:49.121]  We're going to ask the question, you know, this is worse than China.
[00:54:49.602 --> 00:54:51.143]  I mean, this isn't the government.
[00:54:51.163 --> 00:54:59.490]  This is a company doing this, claiming it's some free flow of info, but then censoring anything that criticizes it, claiming that it's some free platform of expression.
[00:55:00.074 --> 00:55:07.017]  This is their desperate attempt to maintain their control of the information infrastructure, and that's what Internet 2 is.
[00:55:07.037 --> 00:55:12.520]  There's going to be a bunch of these MySpace-type platforms, and then they'll be hooked into the new backbones that are being built.
[00:55:12.760 --> 00:55:16.782]  The old Internet backbones, peer-to-peer systems, are not being upgraded.
[00:55:16.802 --> 00:55:22.885]  They're being shut down, and then you're going to be forced in the future onto these grids unless we learn to say no to them now.
[00:55:22.945 --> 00:55:25.366]  Notice how it's the coolest, trendiest thing you can do.
[00:55:26.030 --> 00:55:31.472]  So we're going to go on there, and they may ignore us, not wanting to give us attention, but I have a feeling they'll just squash us.
[00:55:32.033 --> 00:55:35.394]  And it'll be a nice example of how free MySpace is.
[00:55:35.494 --> 00:55:36.995]  Okay, you want me to get a MySpace account?
[00:55:37.355 --> 00:55:37.735]  We will.
[00:55:37.755 --> 00:55:38.595]  We're getting one right now.
[00:55:39.276 --> 00:55:40.816]  And we've got squadrons of people.
[00:55:41.136 --> 00:55:44.818]  If they shut us down on this one, we'll just keep creating new accounts and exposing them.
[00:55:45.138 --> 00:55:46.419]  So the war is on.
[00:55:46.459 --> 00:55:48.519]  You want me to have a MySpace account?
[00:55:48.579 --> 00:55:49.560]  We are invading.
[00:55:50.900 --> 00:55:52.581]  We are invading MySpace.
[00:55:53.241 --> 00:55:54.262]  Because we know what it is.
[00:55:55.635 --> 00:55:57.295]  We're putting in our special forces.
[00:55:57.315 --> 00:56:06.878]  All right, let's go ahead, and Evan and Reno, so tell us about, there's always new 9-11 sites being shut down, but tell us about the 9-11 site that you said you got shut down.
[00:56:07.538 --> 00:56:10.579]  Well, 9-11 Truth didn't actually get his site deleted.
[00:56:10.619 --> 00:56:13.939]  He just got all the scripting on the front of his page deleted.
[00:56:14.099 --> 00:56:17.000]  Well, yeah, they just, okay, well, you still have your page, they just erase it.
[00:56:17.740 --> 00:56:23.062]  Well, they actually deleted my entire account, all my friends' lists and everything, my blogs, they wiped my whole thing.
[00:56:23.582 --> 00:56:24.482]  What was yours called?
[00:56:25.628 --> 00:56:27.209]  I was on the NWO.
[00:56:28.489 --> 00:56:29.469]  On the NWO.
[00:56:29.549 --> 00:56:30.330]  Send me a link.
[00:56:30.370 --> 00:56:32.490]  Send me your original page if you saved it.
[00:56:32.990 --> 00:56:36.832]  Send that to Ryan at InfoWars.com or Kevin at InfoWars.com.
[00:56:37.132 --> 00:56:46.074]  Maybe we should repost your stuff as an archive, a Holocaust museum of the massacre of free speech.
[00:56:46.915 --> 00:56:53.957]  Actually, I already set up another one that's MySpace.com forward slash own underscore the underscore NWO.
[00:56:55.060 --> 00:56:55.520]  Oh, good.
[00:56:56.401 --> 00:57:12.588]  But what they said to me was that I tried to make my profile, you only can be 14 or over, and people will set their profiles to 14 so that their profiles aren't viewable to the general public, so you have to be your friend to see their profile.
[00:57:13.049 --> 00:57:18.391]  And they used that, I accidentally put it a year too young, and so they used that as an excuse and just deleted my whole profile.
[00:57:19.072 --> 00:57:19.732]  Deleted everything.
[00:57:20.185 --> 00:57:22.248]  But I was going to say, you were talking about the moles.
[00:57:22.469 --> 00:57:32.605]  Actually, this other person on MySpace, I'm not going to mention her name, but she's pretty big in the community, and she got a message from, there's people on here that are like,
[00:57:33.939 --> 00:57:35.300]  Obviously, like you said, mole teeth.
[00:57:35.500 --> 00:57:36.800]  Well, sir, it's not my opinion.
[00:57:37.280 --> 00:57:43.943]  Viacom, Walmart, the Defense Department, all of them have hired personally thousands of moles.
[00:57:44.003 --> 00:57:48.144]  In fact, it was on a Frontline program about four years ago.
[00:57:48.484 --> 00:57:54.886]  It showed a huge office building for Viacom with hundreds of teenagers in it typing on fake blogs.
[00:57:55.306 --> 00:57:56.747]  So it's admitted, sir.
[00:57:56.767 --> 00:58:02.909]  This fake profile, or this set-up profile, it has like nothing on it really except for a picture of Jim Morris in it.
[00:58:03.929 --> 00:58:11.955]  They messaged and said, I know you, and then they said, that was the title, and they said, and we are not happy with your little quote-unquote group.
[00:58:12.335 --> 00:58:13.736]  Stop while you have a chance.
[00:58:15.538 --> 00:58:18.660]  I was going to say, the 9-11 Truth Group, they're getting scared.
[00:58:18.680 --> 00:58:24.904]  The 9-11 Truth Group in the group section in government and politics is now on the front page with over 13,000 members.
[00:58:26.125 --> 00:58:31.289]  Well, see, that's what's scaring them is that we are going to take over all of their systems.
[00:58:31.329 --> 00:58:32.830]  They have to shut the doors on it.
[00:58:33.806 --> 00:58:37.307]  What you should do, sir, is have these groups go start their own websites.
[00:58:38.468 --> 00:58:39.808]  I mean, but 13,000 is nothing.
[00:58:41.809 --> 00:58:46.051]  Order a copy of this show for your friends and family at GCNlive.com or call 877-300-7645.
[00:58:57.271 --> 00:58:57.931]  Big Brother.
[00:58:58.591 --> 00:58:59.652]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.352 --> 00:59:01.472]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.113 --> 00:59:02.933]  You want answers?
[00:59:03.693 --> 00:59:04.594]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.254 --> 00:59:08.955]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.436 --> 00:59:13.557]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:20.800 --> 00:59:22.821]  I'll tell you what a globalist is scared of.
[00:59:25.279 --> 00:59:32.944]  PrisonPlanet.com on the big web rating services is routinely as big or bigger than RushLimbaugh.com.
[00:59:34.786 --> 00:59:46.814]  I mean, there's Rush with 600-something radio stations, every day plugging himself, every day pushing, every day talking about his site, and he's been on the air for 15 years or whatever and had a website for 10 or longer.
[00:59:47.817 --> 00:59:52.818]  And he is now, one of my sites is as big as his.
[00:59:52.858 --> 00:59:54.679]  Some days his is bigger, some days mine is bigger.
[00:59:55.059 --> 01:00:01.860]  I mean, overall, his site right now is a little bit bigger on average with visitors than prisonplanet.com.
[01:00:01.880 --> 01:00:05.341]  But I have, what, five sites, three of them that are huge.
[01:00:05.361 --> 01:00:08.362]  So you have to understand that network together dwarfs.
[01:00:09.185 --> 01:00:10.446]  That's why they're scared.
[01:00:10.506 --> 01:00:11.626]  I'm not tooting my horn.
[01:00:12.427 --> 01:00:16.729]  There are hundreds of big sites like mine that are telling the truth about the New World Order exposing 9-11.
[01:00:17.090 --> 01:00:18.310]  That's why they're panicking.
[01:00:18.350 --> 01:00:26.995]  So last hour, we got into MySpace, and now it's censoring, and now Rupert Murdoch admits that the old media is dead, and they've got to take over the new media.
[01:00:27.015 --> 01:00:28.236]  It's not going to happen.
[01:00:28.276 --> 01:00:31.298]  You may fool a bunch of trendy Wendy's into being part of your system, Rupert.
[01:00:31.318 --> 01:00:34.619]  You may be able to buy up cool things like MySpace, but it'll get polluted.
[01:00:34.639 --> 01:00:35.440]  People will leave you.
[01:00:36.320 --> 01:00:37.281]  You're not going to get away with it.
[01:00:38.457 --> 01:00:39.337]  Right now, let's take your calls.
[01:00:56.098 --> 01:00:58.680]  Kevin in North Carolina, then Leslie and others.
[01:00:58.720 --> 01:00:59.301]  Go ahead, Kevin.
[01:00:59.321 --> 01:00:59.881]  You're on the air.
[01:01:00.262 --> 01:01:01.042]  Yeah, Mr. Jones.
[01:01:01.062 --> 01:01:02.904]  Just wanted to thank you for letting me be on today.
[01:01:02.924 --> 01:01:04.645]  Kind of something off the subject.
[01:01:04.705 --> 01:01:10.951]  I just wanted to tell a friend of mine, Henry, that got me turned on to your show and you to what was going on.
[01:01:11.451 --> 01:01:12.992]  I don't want to go back not knowing.
[01:01:13.032 --> 01:01:15.014]  I would rather know even though it is frightening.
[01:01:15.735 --> 01:01:16.475]  We're going to fight.
[01:01:17.036 --> 01:01:22.200]  But I'd rather know than go around like I was not knowing what was going on.
[01:01:22.981 --> 01:01:24.082]  But my son's ADD.
[01:01:25.302 --> 01:01:32.149]  And through your show and some of the professionals that you have on, I took him off the drugs and got my son back.
[01:01:33.310 --> 01:01:34.831]  He was literally like a zombie.
[01:01:35.872 --> 01:01:38.455]  And I would just urge parents to take him off.
[01:01:39.349 --> 01:01:40.310]  Get them off the drugs.
[01:01:40.330 --> 01:01:41.892]  I'm sorry, I'm kind of emotional about it.
[01:01:42.332 --> 01:01:44.054]  Well, your son doesn't have ADD.
[01:01:44.855 --> 01:01:46.757]  Your son is a mammal.
[01:01:47.298 --> 01:01:48.759]  I mean, sir, I'm sure you've had a puppy.
[01:01:48.779 --> 01:01:52.864]  Does it run around chewing on everything, biting, snapping, rolling around, acting crazy?
[01:01:53.965 --> 01:01:55.287]  That's what young mammals do.
[01:01:55.347 --> 01:01:56.208]  It's what seals do.
[01:01:56.268 --> 01:01:57.109]  It's what calves do.
[01:01:57.169 --> 01:01:58.010]  It's what colts do.
[01:01:58.610 --> 01:01:59.731]  It's what lambs do.
[01:02:00.131 --> 01:02:01.031]  It's what we do.
[01:02:01.111 --> 01:02:02.212]  It's what monkeys do.
[01:02:02.812 --> 01:02:05.393]  And they've taken normal behavior.
[01:02:05.834 --> 01:02:11.757]  And, of course, what your son needed in school was discipline to be run around the baseball field until he threw up.
[01:02:12.077 --> 01:02:14.218]  Instead, they tried to jack him up on drugs.
[01:02:14.358 --> 01:02:14.538]  Right.
[01:02:14.718 --> 01:02:17.219]  And now you've gotten him off, and you say you've gotten him back.
[01:02:17.880 --> 01:02:18.140]  Yes.
[01:02:18.260 --> 01:02:20.681]  I mean, he would literally be in his room.
[01:02:20.701 --> 01:02:26.444]  You'd go by his room when he was on the psychotropic drugs, which by the time the end, they had him on four different drugs.
[01:02:27.099 --> 01:02:32.624]  The last two were psychotic drugs that they give to, not bipolar, but schizophrenics.
[01:02:32.684 --> 01:02:33.705]  Yes, sir, it's always the same.
[01:02:33.725 --> 01:02:36.907]  You have a hyper kid, they put them on drugs, they get screwed up, they put them on more drugs.
[01:02:37.228 --> 01:02:38.288]  I mean, it took a lot of work.
[01:02:38.809 --> 01:02:40.530]  You know, it just took patience.
[01:02:40.550 --> 01:02:51.279]  You actually have to work with your child and instead of letting somebody else worry with it, you know, it does take some work of parents that don't want to... Now, did you take the medical advice the doctors have given on this broadcast and take it slowly off?
[01:02:51.860 --> 01:02:52.280]  Yes, sir.
[01:02:53.461 --> 01:02:55.503]  I actually consulted with another physician...
[01:02:57.187 --> 01:03:01.528]  You know, I want to hear this story.
[01:03:01.568 --> 01:03:01.848]  Stay there.
[01:03:01.868 --> 01:03:02.729]  I've been running over you.
[01:03:03.209 --> 01:03:04.369]  Kevin, I want people to hear this.
[01:03:04.389 --> 01:03:06.610]  This is important because this is the story we hear every day.
[01:03:07.690 --> 01:03:09.771]  And again, the drug companies, they're drug pushers.
[01:03:09.811 --> 01:03:11.351]  They want people to take more drugs or less.
[01:03:12.691 --> 01:03:14.792]  They give you drugs that make you go crazy.
[01:03:15.012 --> 01:03:16.292]  And their own documents say it.
[01:03:16.352 --> 01:03:17.713]  They knew it when they got it approved.
[01:03:17.773 --> 01:03:18.813]  Prozac in 82.
[01:03:19.413 --> 01:03:20.233]  They knew this.
[01:03:21.334 --> 01:03:22.754]  That's how evil they are.
[01:03:22.814 --> 01:03:23.014]  Again...
[01:03:23.837 --> 01:03:25.398]  The illegal drug war.
[01:03:25.438 --> 01:03:26.879]  Are there more drugs today or are there less?
[01:03:27.119 --> 01:03:28.680]  There's more drugs on the streets today.
[01:03:28.960 --> 01:03:29.841]  The drug war is bigger.
[01:03:29.901 --> 01:03:30.721]  More of us in prison.
[01:03:31.682 --> 01:03:33.283]  Is Iraq better or worse?
[01:03:33.463 --> 01:03:34.263]  Iraq's worse.
[01:03:34.323 --> 01:03:35.644]  Do the globalists want it to be worse?
[01:03:35.744 --> 01:03:36.004]  Yes.
[01:03:36.044 --> 01:03:37.285]  They make more money staying there.
[01:03:37.986 --> 01:03:41.868]  See, it's just common sense, supply and demand, free market.
[01:03:42.308 --> 01:03:43.329]  Who stands to gain?
[01:03:43.409 --> 01:03:43.949]  Key Bono.
[01:03:43.969 --> 01:03:44.770]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:03:44.810 --> 01:03:51.674]  I want you to recap your story and tell us more when we get back, Kevin, and we'll talk to Leslie and others.
[01:03:53.849 --> 01:04:01.211]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[01:04:01.492 --> 01:04:06.233]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[01:04:06.453 --> 01:04:12.095]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[01:04:12.355 --> 01:04:16.859]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[01:04:17.099 --> 01:04:24.245]  The cashless society control grid, infallible microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[01:04:24.265 --> 01:04:28.809]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[01:04:28.970 --> 01:04:31.472]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[01:04:31.712 --> 01:04:38.418]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.

[01:04:52.782 --> 01:04:54.384]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:04:54.764 --> 01:05:00.489]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[01:05:00.749 --> 01:05:05.894]  The Berkey light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[01:05:06.234 --> 01:05:15.503]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, trihalomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.
[01:05:15.843 --> 01:05:20.805]  Its rechargeable 8-lamp bright white LED lighting system provides the ideal source of emergency light.
[01:05:21.125 --> 01:05:25.146]  The lights can run all night on a single charge, and it is bright enough to read by.
[01:05:25.347 --> 01:05:30.088]  This provides a relaxing and ambient night light and allows for optimum use during emergency conditions.
[01:05:30.468 --> 01:05:36.431]  The Berkey Light's revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.

[01:05:54.375 --> 01:05:56.957]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here with an important question.
[01:05:57.117 --> 01:05:59.258]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[01:05:59.538 --> 01:06:09.644]  I mean the hard to find kind that's all natural and not full of corrosive toxins and chemicals and detergents that just dry out your skin and have been connected to very serious health problems?
[01:06:09.965 --> 01:06:12.286]  Let me tell you something about the Cal Bend Pure Soap Company.
[01:06:12.466 --> 01:06:16.550]  There's a 100% unconditional guarantee on all their wonderful products.
[01:06:16.750 --> 01:06:22.876]  They're all natural, they're triple concentrated, they're factory direct, factory owned and operated since 1947.

[01:06:36.388 --> 01:06:39.451]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:39.471 --> 01:06:41.153]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:07:02.139 --> 01:07:06.682]  For our stations that just joined us, we've got Dr. Paul Craig Roberts coming up in about 25 minutes.
[01:07:07.522 --> 01:07:10.985]  Then we have some of the Iraqi mothers coming on who are traveling the U.S.
[01:07:11.025 --> 01:07:15.407]  exposing what really happened over there and is happening in the third hour.
[01:07:15.427 --> 01:07:18.729]  We're going to go back to Kevin and Leslie and Leo and others here in just a minute.
[01:07:19.070 --> 01:07:21.911]  Toll-free number to join us today on this Wednesday edition, 1-800-259-9231.
[01:07:25.296 --> 01:07:34.520]  Before I go back to Kevin, who I want people to be able to hear, during the last segment he talked about getting his son off the government drugs and how he suddenly got his son back.
[01:07:34.900 --> 01:07:42.723]  We're going to tell that story, let him tell that story, because that makes this broadcast really worth it and it just feels good to know that we're helping people come out of this bondage.
[01:07:43.624 --> 01:07:50.907]  But before I do that, I'm very happy to announce that our Citizen Rulebook Initiative has really been popular.
[01:07:52.160 --> 01:08:05.530]  Every order, every DVD order, every VHS order, every T-shirt order, every bumper sticker order, you order anything from InfoWars.com and the Secure Online Shopping Cart, or anything you order from the toll-free line, or any mail-in order, you send us.
[01:08:07.031 --> 01:08:12.695]  For any InfoWarfare tool we sell, you get one of these little 64-page...
[01:08:15.012 --> 01:08:22.554]  ...color citizen rule books, free, and it has the Bill of Rights, jury handbook, the fireworks are in the document itself, read the Constitution.
[01:08:23.174 --> 01:08:32.577]  It starts out with the table of contents, jury duty, you're above the law, jury rights, law of the land, Ten Commandments, Communist Manifesto, give up your rights, jury tampering.
[01:08:33.537 --> 01:08:42.220]  It just explains how this country really works versus other systems, how juries and grand juries really work, how the jury is an emergency steam valve against tyranny.
[01:08:43.740 --> 01:08:46.422]  Then it's got a bunch of the famous papers and quotes.
[01:08:46.502 --> 01:08:53.187]  Patrick Henry, Shocked, Jury of Peers, Freedom for William Penn, Jefferson's Warning, Section 3 is the original document.
[01:08:53.227 --> 01:08:58.612]  So most of the book is just famous quotes and how our form of government is supposed to operate.
[01:08:58.652 --> 01:09:03.135]  Then it's got the Index of Documents, Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, Bill of Rights.
[01:09:04.296 --> 01:09:05.917]  We are selling these at cost.
[01:09:06.978 --> 01:09:08.639]  We are selling these at cost.
[01:09:08.679 --> 01:09:10.721]  You can buy 100 of them, 50 of them, 25 of them, 10 of them.
[01:09:12.583 --> 01:09:17.945]  We sell them in 10 increments, 10 and up, and it's just a great deal.
[01:09:18.525 --> 01:09:21.426]  You can get 100 of these for $75.
[01:09:23.007 --> 01:09:24.247]  100 of these for $75.
[01:09:24.328 --> 01:09:25.168]  Give them to everybody.
[01:09:25.528 --> 01:09:26.428]  They are so powerful.
[01:09:26.488 --> 01:09:28.929]  Or just get the $10 tin special.
[01:09:29.590 --> 01:09:33.531]  Or order a DVD, Martial Law, Road to Tyranny, or Order of Death.
[01:09:33.871 --> 01:09:36.772]  Order any of the great films we produce or other films or books we carry.
[01:09:37.072 --> 01:09:41.274]  Go peruse the Safe Secure Shopping Cart and order some of these today while you're at it.
[01:09:42.236 --> 01:09:46.797]  Because the globalists are afraid of you learning what America's really supposed to be about.
[01:09:47.057 --> 01:09:49.578]  How many cops out there listening right now have sworn an oath to this?
[01:09:49.598 --> 01:09:53.499]  You're not bad people, but you violate it every day because you don't know what's in it.
[01:09:54.799 --> 01:09:56.619]  Jack McClam's told that story many times.
[01:09:56.679 --> 01:09:58.220]  Police and military against the new world order.
[01:09:58.620 --> 01:10:08.122]  How an old man back in the, I guess it was the early 80s, stood up when he was cop of the year giving a speech and said, What about the Constitution, sonny?
[01:10:12.063 --> 01:10:16.265]  And how that really embarrassed Jack, because the old man was asking him, what's this amendment?
[01:10:16.285 --> 01:10:17.066]  What's that amendment?
[01:10:17.126 --> 01:10:17.806]  And he didn't know.
[01:10:17.826 --> 01:10:20.508]  And when he went and read it, he found out he was wrong.
[01:10:21.088 --> 01:10:24.289]  So get a copy of this at Infowars.com today, or call toll-free, 1-888-253-3139.
[01:10:24.309 --> 01:10:30.613]  Or you can simply write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, L-A-M-A-R, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[01:10:42.762 --> 01:10:47.005]  Okay, let's go back to Kevin in North Carolina.
[01:10:47.045 --> 01:10:52.509]  Kevin, tell listeners the story in greater detail that you started to tell at the last minute of the last segment.
[01:10:53.469 --> 01:10:59.414]  I mean, you're listening to the show, your son's on what drugs, what happened, how he got on them, and then now what happened that you took him off of them.
[01:10:59.954 --> 01:11:08.640]  Well, the main drug they put him on, once he went to kindergarten, he got in first grade, went through first grade, got into second grade, went
[01:11:09.386 --> 01:11:18.633]  Partly my fault, because I worked third shifts, and my wife dealt with a lot of it that was going on with the schools, which is my fault for not being there a lot of the times that they went.
[01:11:20.314 --> 01:11:36.586]  But I didn't know anything yet about the show or anything that's going on, and went along with medical... What they suggested to put him on, they put him on Welbutrin.
[01:11:37.987 --> 01:11:38.267]  There was...
[01:11:38.854 --> 01:11:44.839]  By the time the next year he was on another drug, another six months, you know, the teacher's standing, still having problems.
[01:11:45.479 --> 01:11:47.101]  You know, he was on four different drugs.
[01:11:47.201 --> 01:11:48.101]  Yeah, and he's acting up.
[01:11:48.141 --> 01:11:50.804]  I mean, at a certain point, why not just chop his head off with a guillotine?
[01:11:51.104 --> 01:11:51.344]  Right.
[01:11:51.384 --> 01:11:52.665]  Well, I mean, that's the way they go.
[01:11:52.725 --> 01:11:53.866]  I mean, that's the way it goes.
[01:11:53.946 --> 01:12:03.674]  And my child would literally, by the time the end of it, he was on so much, I'd come by his room, and he'd just be sitting there just staring into space.
[01:12:04.511 --> 01:12:06.572]  Now, was that around the time you found the broadcast?
[01:12:06.952 --> 01:12:07.352]  Yes, sir.
[01:12:07.993 --> 01:12:08.973]  About the same time.
[01:12:09.253 --> 01:12:10.894]  Because the next thing is electroshock.
[01:12:10.954 --> 01:12:21.199]  I have a Newsday article where they electroshock 100,000 children a year nationwide, and they'll take healthy, happy kids, hop them up on drugs, and by the time they're done with it, the kids are dying.
[01:12:21.260 --> 01:12:21.900]  But go ahead.
[01:12:22.300 --> 01:12:23.601]  Well, you could just look in his eyes.
[01:12:24.041 --> 01:12:25.342]  There was nothing there.
[01:12:25.622 --> 01:12:27.363]  I mean, he would just, you know, I'd say, what's wrong?
[01:12:27.383 --> 01:12:28.083]  He'd start crying.
[01:12:28.857 --> 01:12:29.598]  And I said, what's wrong?
[01:12:29.638 --> 01:12:30.838]  And he said, I don't know what to do.
[01:12:30.918 --> 01:12:32.159]  And I said, well, you finished your homework?
[01:12:32.199 --> 01:12:33.340]  Yes, I finished my homework.
[01:12:33.380 --> 01:12:34.441]  Well, let's play something.
[01:12:35.262 --> 01:12:35.922]  What do you want to play?
[01:12:35.982 --> 01:12:36.462]  I don't know.
[01:12:36.482 --> 01:12:38.464]  I don't know what to do.
[01:12:38.524 --> 01:12:40.325]  I mean, he was literally, I don't know what to do.
[01:12:40.345 --> 01:12:42.406]  Gosh, they're so evil.
[01:12:42.707 --> 01:12:46.489]  And they got mindless teachers and mindless doctors because the media says it's good.
[01:12:46.790 --> 01:12:47.230]  They do it.
[01:12:47.270 --> 01:12:51.473]  Well, Hitler's media said, you know, blowing women's heads off was good.
[01:12:51.533 --> 01:12:52.594]  It doesn't mean it's good.
[01:12:52.614 --> 01:12:54.775]  No, sir, it's not good.
[01:12:55.155 --> 01:12:56.436]  And it takes, you know, it takes work.
[01:12:57.870 --> 01:13:01.951]  Like you say, you can't just... For people to listen to have children, they tell them this.
[01:13:02.851 --> 01:13:06.232]  You know, you can't just stop giving it to them like you said.
[01:13:07.753 --> 01:13:14.375]  You know, the only thing I pray to God is I hope I haven't messed him up by having him on it for as long, you know, the two years he was on it.
[01:13:14.395 --> 01:13:19.516]  The people I've talked to, people can rebound amazingly, especially with the help of God.
[01:13:19.556 --> 01:13:22.397]  But the experts I've talked to in my own experiences...
[01:13:23.217 --> 01:13:24.278]  You've got people acting up.
[01:13:24.318 --> 01:13:27.719]  They need attention, they need discipline, and they need to be taken on 10-mile hikes.
[01:13:28.960 --> 01:13:32.702]  And you start marching people around, they're going to get in gear real quick.
[01:13:32.742 --> 01:13:39.265]  Number one, endorphins are going to flow, natural drugs that we're supposed to have that God gave us, and that's going to fix it for people that have got...
[01:13:40.001 --> 01:13:40.462]  Yeah, get them busy.
[01:13:40.482 --> 01:13:42.485]  Because before then, he didn't play sports.
[01:13:42.505 --> 01:13:43.446]  Now he plays baseball.
[01:13:43.466 --> 01:13:43.846]  He wrestles.
[01:13:56.354 --> 01:13:56.694]  Exactly.
[01:13:56.774 --> 01:13:58.156]  I'm all for athleticism.
[01:13:58.196 --> 01:14:00.038]  People get confused and go, Alex, you don't like sports.
[01:14:00.098 --> 01:14:05.725]  No, I don't like spending $5,000 to go to a football game when the country's going to hell in a handbasket.
[01:14:05.765 --> 01:14:08.709]  I think it's great to have your children in as many sports as possible.
[01:14:09.109 --> 01:14:09.530]  All right.
[01:14:09.590 --> 01:14:13.494]  Well, I hate for anybody to come up and ask me, you know, did you see the game yesterday?
[01:14:14.415 --> 01:14:15.517]  You know, and I'm worried about...
[01:14:17.149 --> 01:14:24.531]  What we worry about, you know, the... Fifteen percent of our children plus are already on these, sir, and they're dying and having heart attacks.
[01:14:24.751 --> 01:14:34.573]  Did you know that on the inserts of the amphetamine ritalins and then on the serotonin reuptake inhibitors, it emits heart attacks, stunning in growth, toxic problems, liver failure?
[01:14:34.794 --> 01:14:36.674]  I mean, just physical stuff, not just mental.
[01:14:37.429 --> 01:14:38.870]  I mean, these things are deadly poison.
[01:14:38.910 --> 01:14:41.512]  They're made out of chlorine molecules.
[01:14:41.812 --> 01:14:45.315]  Well, it's like the lady that you had on, it was last week, I believe.
[01:14:45.355 --> 01:14:46.376]  I can't remember now.
[01:14:46.456 --> 01:14:47.276]  I'm bad with names.
[01:14:48.077 --> 01:14:57.704]  But she was talking about they were going to have to put, actually, they were going to have to put some kind of label on the boxes, their sales, some type of, like the cigarettes are bad for you.
[01:14:58.125 --> 01:14:59.145]  Yeah, Gwen Olsen.
[01:14:59.526 --> 01:14:59.826]  Right.
[01:15:00.305 --> 01:15:00.565]  Right.
[01:15:01.125 --> 01:15:15.210]  Yeah, her niece was top of her class, getting out of high school, all these scholarships, got in a car wreck, put her on the opiates, put her on one of the codeines, and then she got depressed when they took her off of it.
[01:15:15.230 --> 01:15:22.092]  That's a normal response when you've been taking a heroin-type drug, an Oxycontin-type drug, and they take you off of it.
[01:15:23.072 --> 01:15:29.334]  And so they hopped her up on drugs, she went crazy on them, and then poured basically gasoline on herself and burned herself up.
[01:15:30.532 --> 01:15:33.995]  Yeah, well, I want to thank you because I know you don't like a lot of praise.
[01:15:34.616 --> 01:15:38.219]  And it's just because of the proud person that you are, but you do help people.
[01:15:39.100 --> 01:15:40.761]  Well, it's not even that I don't like the praise.
[01:15:40.781 --> 01:15:42.743]  It's just that I don't deserve praise, sir.
[01:15:43.123 --> 01:15:45.205]  I know that there are kids dying every day from this.
[01:15:45.285 --> 01:15:49.629]  I know that it's designed to make your kid go crazy so they can put them on more drugs.
[01:15:50.409 --> 01:15:55.674]  I mean, if I saw, I wouldn't expect, listen, I saved a woman who was choking.
[01:15:56.954 --> 01:15:59.916]  We were at LaMetta Line about three and a half years ago.
[01:16:00.436 --> 01:16:08.662]  My wife, I, my son, and he was pretty near a newborn then, and we're there in the restaurant eating, and this woman starts choking.
[01:16:08.682 --> 01:16:09.322]  And I'm not kidding.
[01:16:09.422 --> 01:16:10.122]  I've been in the bathroom.
[01:16:10.142 --> 01:16:17.047]  I walked out, and everyone's standing around for like 30 seconds while she's choking, turning blue, about to pass out on the table.
[01:16:18.039 --> 01:16:22.761]  And I had to actually fight my way through them going, no, 911, wait for the ambulance.
[01:16:22.821 --> 01:16:27.962]  They were so sheepish that they didn't know you were supposed to perform the Heimlich Maneuver.
[01:16:28.002 --> 01:16:29.363]  I mean, about 30 people.
[01:16:29.863 --> 01:16:31.083]  I had to shove them aside.
[01:16:31.103 --> 01:16:33.304]  I had to take command in the commander voice.
[01:16:33.504 --> 01:16:33.904]  Get back!
[01:16:34.514 --> 01:16:35.355]  Move out of the way!
[01:16:35.375 --> 01:16:36.595]  And then people argued with me.
[01:16:36.656 --> 01:16:37.856]  I said, I'm in control!
[01:16:38.016 --> 01:16:38.537]  Out of the way!
[01:16:38.557 --> 01:16:42.700]  I had to talk to them like a cop talks to idiots on the side of the road, you know, in an accident.
[01:16:43.160 --> 01:16:48.384]  And I had to get them out of the way, and I had to go in there, and the woman caught a big old wad of bread.
[01:16:48.444 --> 01:16:49.404]  She would have died.
[01:16:49.684 --> 01:16:53.387]  The ambulance couldn't have gotten there in closer than ten minutes if they had rockets on the back.
[01:16:54.108 --> 01:16:56.250]  I mean, and I'm not even a special person.
[01:16:56.470 --> 01:16:59.432]  Americans 30 years ago would have immediately done the Heimlich.
[01:16:59.652 --> 01:17:01.353]  We've turned into cattle, brother.
[01:17:01.373 --> 01:17:03.174]  So I don't deserve thanks.
[01:17:03.194 --> 01:17:04.315]  It was, oh, you're so good.
[01:17:04.855 --> 01:17:06.957]  Oh, you're so great after I saved the woman.
[01:17:07.217 --> 01:17:09.538]  I'm just doing what I'm supposed to do.
[01:17:10.119 --> 01:17:10.459]  Yes, sir.
[01:17:10.479 --> 01:17:16.783]  Well, like I say, my friend Henry and his father, they've listened to you for a long time, and he turned me on.
[01:17:17.303 --> 01:17:19.405]  If I can just tell people, you know, just out there,
[01:17:20.083 --> 01:17:20.804]  Get the books.
[01:17:20.964 --> 01:17:22.165]  Get Tex Moore's book.
[01:17:22.345 --> 01:17:23.966]  Get Colonel Craig's Robert.
[01:17:24.026 --> 01:17:26.248]  Listen to these people because they know what they're talking about.
[01:17:26.928 --> 01:17:28.590]  You back everything that you do up.
[01:17:29.290 --> 01:17:31.692]  Martial Law is one of the best films I've seen.
[01:17:31.732 --> 01:17:35.715]  The Road to Tyranny.
[01:17:35.735 --> 01:17:36.496]  I make copies.
[01:17:36.656 --> 01:17:42.461]  The police is what, like you say, you need to really focus on because they're going to be losing their jobs here in North Carolina.
[01:17:42.541 --> 01:17:45.463]  All DOT way stations are all privatized now.
[01:17:47.167 --> 01:17:50.608]  They're dying court taking over sheriff's departments.
[01:17:51.688 --> 01:17:51.928]  Right.
[01:17:53.608 --> 01:18:03.230]  You know, Gaston County, which is near here, Charlotte, North Carolina, they're announcing all over the radio for the last couple weeks.
[01:18:03.310 --> 01:18:06.010]  I mean, the TV, they have the drone planes now.
[01:18:06.530 --> 01:18:07.371]  Oh, yeah.
[01:18:07.751 --> 01:18:10.931]  What did the school say after you got your son off these drugs and he got better?
[01:18:11.571 --> 01:18:15.512]  Well, they wanted to set up a meeting with the school psychologists.
[01:18:16.172 --> 01:18:22.514]  After we had got him off for a while, because he went into the next year, and the teacher said, you know, he was having some problems paying attention.
[01:18:22.534 --> 01:18:26.015]  That's because your curriculum is boring.
[01:18:26.035 --> 01:18:28.116]  You stick real teachers in there and give them real curriculum.
[01:18:28.136 --> 01:18:29.036]  They're not going to be bored.
[01:18:29.336 --> 01:18:30.957]  But I got a pretty funny story about it.
[01:18:31.537 --> 01:18:35.418]  I had to take him to the doctor for a stomachache, but I went to the school and got him that day.
[01:18:35.478 --> 01:18:38.399]  It happened to be on the same day we were supposed to meet with the psychologist.
[01:18:39.019 --> 01:18:40.960]  His stomach was throwing up real bad.
[01:18:42.768 --> 01:18:48.591]  And they come back and ask if they put him on anything, and I said, yeah, they give him some Finnegan when I brought him back the next day.
[01:18:48.611 --> 01:18:49.512]  I'll stay there.
[01:18:49.712 --> 01:18:52.033]  I'll let you finish real quick when we get back, and we'll go to Leslie.
[01:18:53.294 --> 01:19:01.902]  Berkey water filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[01:19:02.122 --> 01:19:13.411]  The Berkey Light self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, salt for odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[01:19:13.632 --> 01:19:16.254]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:19:16.594 --> 01:19:23.058]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled, and it can be used anywhere on a flat surface.
[01:19:23.218 --> 01:19:25.099]  That's because it has an elevated base.
[01:19:25.280 --> 01:19:31.323]  The entire system joins together to make the Berkey Light convenient to transport, even while it's filtering water.
[01:19:31.563 --> 01:19:37.167]  Its rechargeable bright white LED lamps allow for optimum use at night or during emergency conditions.
[01:19:37.547 --> 01:19:41.109]  Get the Berkey Light, the ultimate filter for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:19:41.129 --> 01:19:41.709]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[01:19:41.729 --> 01:19:42.490]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:19:42.510 --> 01:19:43.650]  Currency, devaluation, inflation.
[01:19:43.670 --> 01:19:44.311]  One and the same.
[01:20:03.163 --> 01:20:13.006]  If you had deposited $100,000 in a bank at 1% in a 30-month period dating from May 24, 2005, here is what happened to your funds.
[01:20:13.426 --> 01:20:16.548]  The dollar lost 33% of its value in that time frame.
[01:20:16.808 --> 01:20:18.648]  The bank paid you 1%.
[01:20:18.728 --> 01:20:21.729]  Your $100,000 now has a net purchasing power of $68,000.
[01:20:22.269 --> 01:20:24.490]  Here is reality.
[01:20:24.850 --> 01:20:28.452]  The devaluation of currency equals real inflation.
[01:20:28.932 --> 01:20:32.553]  Keep in mind how the value of your paper assets are measured in dollars.
[01:20:33.143 --> 01:20:34.624]  Do you know the truth about breast cancer?
[01:20:34.644 --> 01:20:36.705]  Did you know that the race for the cure is over?
[01:21:00.799 --> 01:21:08.681]  The best kept secret in the country today is that it is now possible to kill cancer without personal suffering, mutilation, and poisoning of your entire system.
[01:21:08.902 --> 01:21:11.542]  Now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaysMed, Inc.'
[01:21:11.522 --> 01:21:12.943]  's patented methodology.

[01:21:16.864 --> 01:21:21.246]  We can destroy tumors of any size without adverse side effects at a physician's office.

[01:21:45.475 --> 01:21:56.518]  On February 29, 1892, the United States of America's Supreme Court declared us a Christian nation.
[01:22:04.997 --> 01:22:14.659]  However, over recent years, for the last three decades, there's been a deliberate war on Christianity in America to wipe out our heritage from the minds of our people.
[01:22:15.559 --> 01:22:22.220]  The First Amendment to the Constitution guarantees us religious freedom, and yet it's under attack today.
[01:22:23.120 --> 01:22:31.922]  We would like to send you a one-year absolutely free subscription to Newswatch Magazine that gives you the background of what is happening in America.
[01:22:32.466 --> 01:22:32.966]  1-800-516-8736 That's 1-800-516-8736 Call now.
[01:22:33.006 --> 01:22:37.830]  Our operators are standing by for an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[01:22:57.176 --> 01:22:58.577]  This show is documented.
[01:22:59.118 --> 01:23:01.880]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:23:02.620 --> 01:23:05.963]  Folks, this is how it normally happens.
[01:23:06.564 --> 01:23:16.492]  You let your five or six year old eat a bunch of Twinkies and drink Coca-Colas filled with enough caffeine to hop up a horse for a horse race.
[01:23:17.219 --> 01:23:19.840]  Then they bounce off the walls even more than they normally would.
[01:23:19.880 --> 01:23:27.102]  They're inside playing video games and watching TV all day instead of playing outside eight hours a day like we did, or even more like our parents did.
[01:23:27.123 --> 01:23:33.845]  And then the school comes in and puts them on deadly psychotropic drugs or amphetamine drugs that just burn out their little brains.
[01:23:34.565 --> 01:23:35.686]  And yeah, it does settle them down.
[01:23:35.746 --> 01:23:37.466]  The speed really burns their brains out.
[01:23:37.486 --> 01:23:42.768]  It causes massive heart attacks, heart palpitations, heart expansions, heart shrinkage.
[01:23:43.388 --> 01:23:45.509]  So just for those medical reasons, you shouldn't take it.
[01:23:46.593 --> 01:23:47.335]  And what does Bush do?
[01:23:47.375 --> 01:23:49.579]  He passes a new freedom trying to force people to take it.
[01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.725]  And we know, you slowly get them off these drugs, they're a lot better.
[01:23:52.805 --> 01:23:54.608]  People always get worse on these drugs.
[01:23:54.869 --> 01:23:57.073]  They just don't know they're worse because they're addicted.
[01:23:57.819 --> 01:23:59.440]  Real fast, because I want to go to Leslie and others.
[01:23:59.480 --> 01:24:00.520]  I'm sorry to keep you on so long.
[01:24:00.540 --> 01:24:01.461]  You bring up a good point.
[01:24:01.521 --> 01:24:04.082]  I'm glad your son got better after you got him off the stuff.
[01:24:04.102 --> 01:24:05.083]  You got him in sports now.
[01:24:06.303 --> 01:24:08.725]  And then I asked, what did the school try to keep him on them?
[01:24:08.885 --> 01:24:09.845]  Because they get money for that.
[01:24:09.905 --> 01:24:10.806]  Kevin, go ahead and finish up.
[01:24:11.246 --> 01:24:14.988]  Well, they started suggesting stuff.
[01:24:15.128 --> 01:24:16.369]  They could try him on this.
[01:24:16.409 --> 01:24:18.390]  They could put him on Ritalin that he never was on.
[01:24:19.130 --> 01:24:21.431]  And I point blank told them I'm not putting him on anything.
[01:24:22.412 --> 01:24:22.492]  And...
[01:24:23.877 --> 01:24:25.178]  It's just the teachers, you know.
[01:24:25.238 --> 01:24:31.662]  I mean, I know teachers have a hard job, but a lot of times, literally, they want them zombified.
[01:24:32.923 --> 01:24:35.424]  But here's kind of a funny story about it.
[01:24:35.464 --> 01:24:36.205]  Look, look, look.
[01:24:36.265 --> 01:24:38.987]  They took the paddles out of the schools and put woodland in.
[01:24:39.607 --> 01:24:39.827]  Right.
[01:24:41.108 --> 01:24:43.169]  Took discipline out that you used to have to listen.
[01:24:43.189 --> 01:24:44.290]  Well, in school, you used to.
[01:24:44.330 --> 01:24:47.032]  When we went to school, the men had suits on.
[01:24:47.852 --> 01:24:49.613]  You know, the ladies looked like ladies.
[01:24:49.653 --> 01:24:51.434]  The teachers looked like, you know, ladies.
[01:24:51.474 --> 01:24:52.195]  They dressed like
[01:24:52.975 --> 01:24:58.540]  Ladies, and now you have, you know, I've seen some teachers that look like they should be in a nightclub
[01:24:59.088 --> 01:25:00.449]  Instead of teaching children.
[01:25:00.529 --> 01:25:07.174]  Well, the biggest thing is that we're a social creature, similar to a dog in our behavior socially.
[01:25:07.734 --> 01:25:13.658]  We do what we see the alpha males and females do, and the alphas, the leaders in our community, are the idiots on sitcoms.
[01:25:13.999 --> 01:25:16.721]  Take all the Fox TV shows where it degrades the family.
[01:25:17.081 --> 01:25:19.543]  People think smarting off and being an idiot is cool.
[01:25:20.043 --> 01:25:24.146]  Your kids watch that and go repeat it, but in the real world, they don't get success with that.
[01:25:25.276 --> 01:25:25.696]  Well, right.
[01:25:25.757 --> 01:25:32.563]  It's like you will turn the TV off, take them and throw them out in the yard, teach them to read a book or play, like you say.
[01:25:32.803 --> 01:25:34.925]  Well, listen, it's good news and good testimony, Kevin.
[01:25:35.105 --> 01:25:35.486]  Yes, sir.
[01:25:35.566 --> 01:25:36.166]  I appreciate it.
[01:25:36.186 --> 01:25:36.487]  Thank you.
[01:25:36.507 --> 01:25:37.688]  People, buy the videos.
[01:25:38.248 --> 01:25:38.969]  Buy Marshall Law.
[01:25:38.989 --> 01:25:40.670]  If you haven't seen it, give it to people.
[01:25:40.711 --> 01:25:41.411]  Let them keep it.
[01:25:41.631 --> 01:25:42.252]  Buy another one.
[01:25:43.405 --> 01:25:44.465]  Thanks for the support, Kevin.
[01:25:44.505 --> 01:25:45.066]  God bless you.
[01:25:45.106 --> 01:25:51.051]  And it really makes me feel good to know that you got your son back, getting him off of the drugs that are designed to basically kill him.
[01:25:51.532 --> 01:25:52.893]  Leslie in Virginia.
[01:25:52.913 --> 01:25:54.434]  You've been holding patiently.
[01:25:54.474 --> 01:25:54.735]  Go ahead.
[01:25:54.755 --> 01:25:55.655]  You're on the air.
[01:25:56.036 --> 01:25:58.178]  That was a heartwarming story by Kevin.
[01:25:59.058 --> 01:25:59.779]  No doubt about it.
[01:25:59.819 --> 01:26:03.422]  We need to restore individual responsibility and accountability.
[01:26:04.043 --> 01:26:05.965]  I'm just calling to update you on...
[01:26:06.894 --> 01:26:10.959]  Senate Bill 1313 on the Property Rights Protection Act.
[01:26:11.019 --> 01:26:12.181]  Are you familiar with that?
[01:26:12.321 --> 01:26:13.142]  Yes, I've read it.
[01:26:13.162 --> 01:26:15.505]  In my opinion, it doesn't really strengthen it enough.
[01:26:15.525 --> 01:26:16.506]  I mean, it's already there.
[01:26:18.506 --> 01:26:19.667]  I agree.
[01:26:20.247 --> 01:26:22.408]  And as you probably know, the House voted 376 to 38.
[01:26:23.088 --> 01:26:25.409]  It's like the torture bill.
[01:26:25.489 --> 01:26:27.390]  You think the torture bill outlaws torture.
[01:26:27.670 --> 01:26:28.710]  It was already illegal.
[01:26:28.770 --> 01:26:31.652]  It actually semi-legalizes torture.
[01:26:31.912 --> 01:26:41.556]  See, and they'll claim this property rights bill really supports property rights, but really it waters it down a little bit while rebuking the full-out claim of the Supreme Court that no one owns anything.
[01:26:42.076 --> 01:26:42.496]  Correct.
[01:26:42.936 --> 01:26:46.038]  Now, the worst... I called my senators...
[01:26:47.332 --> 01:26:51.176]  Alan and Warner in Virginia about this, and I called Spector.
[01:26:51.617 --> 01:26:58.304]  And as you know, Spector is chair of the judiciary, but he's been sitting on this since September.
[01:26:58.884 --> 01:27:05.531]  And I'd like my concern and my disappointment to bring this issue for a vote at least.
[01:27:06.064 --> 01:27:20.055]  So I just wanted to get to know if your listeners can call and read Senate Bill 1313 and call Specter's office so we can get something rolling.
[01:27:20.495 --> 01:27:23.717]  Because, as you know, the people in Louisiana are suffering right now.
[01:27:23.757 --> 01:27:25.719]  They're going after a church in California.
[01:27:26.329 --> 01:27:37.413]  I was saying they don't pay taxes and the whole thing, as you know, was... Look, I've had the head of Western Seafood on, Mr. Gore, who makes $45 million profit a year.
[01:27:37.453 --> 01:27:38.334]  It's a big company.
[01:27:38.834 --> 01:27:41.315]  And they're just saying, we're taking your land and we ain't paying for it.
[01:27:42.575 --> 01:27:44.996]  Because the heir of Mobil wants it.
[01:27:45.576 --> 01:27:47.437]  And that's down in Freeport, Texas.
[01:27:47.997 --> 01:27:49.718]  So, I mean, it's just everywhere.
[01:27:50.282 --> 01:27:51.223]  It's out of control.
[01:27:51.624 --> 01:27:53.085]  You take property rights away.
[01:27:53.606 --> 01:27:56.249]  And, you know, we're right there with China.
[01:27:56.269 --> 01:28:01.656]  Well, listen, it's $1,000 a day fines in Texas if you don't do premises registration.
[01:28:01.676 --> 01:28:09.285]  And if you take your horse off your property, they're trying... It's got what Florida already has as law, the equine passport law.
[01:28:09.725 --> 01:28:11.586]  Where you can't even take your horse off your property.
[01:28:11.646 --> 01:28:13.366]  It's satellite tracked off the cell towers.
[01:28:13.386 --> 01:28:15.107]  I mean, that's Fort Worth Star-Telegram.
[01:28:15.147 --> 01:28:16.787]  That isn't Alex Jones making that claim.
[01:28:17.127 --> 01:28:18.207]  I mean, this isn't freedom.
[01:28:18.247 --> 01:28:19.448]  We don't own private property.
[01:28:19.508 --> 01:28:21.328]  Our kids got to take drugs.
[01:28:21.368 --> 01:28:28.450]  We got to have chips in all our animals and got to register our land with the government and have satellites tracking it and having specters on it.
[01:28:28.470 --> 01:28:31.991]  I mean, it's all just a bunch of crooks trying to destroy the free market.
[01:28:32.491 --> 01:28:33.712]  They're monopoly men.
[01:28:33.732 --> 01:28:35.632]  That's what the New World Order is.
[01:28:35.832 --> 01:28:37.333]  It's a monopoly of tyranny.
[01:28:37.693 --> 01:28:38.793]  A monopoly of terror.
[01:28:43.436 --> 01:28:44.318]  We're on the march.
[01:28:44.820 --> 01:28:46.424]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.366 --> 01:28:50.052]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.041 --> 01:28:58.806]  Discover a natural way to experience healthier, cleaner indoor air without expensive filters and high-maintenance machines.
[01:28:59.046 --> 01:29:01.529]  Discover what natural health professionals have known for decades.
[01:29:01.689 --> 01:29:04.311]  Natural salt lamps ionize and purify indoor air.
[01:29:04.471 --> 01:29:08.174]  Natural salt lamps come handcrafted from salt crystals that are millions of years old.
[01:29:08.274 --> 01:29:13.399]  These lamps create healthy ions that eliminate odor, reduce bacteria, and can help allergy and asthma sufferers.
[01:29:13.579 --> 01:29:13.939]  We're good to go.
[01:29:40.054 --> 01:29:40.454]  Or call 312-224-2710.
[01:29:40.494 --> 01:29:40.695]  That's 312-224-2710.
[01:29:52.927 --> 01:29:54.908]  You've asked for them and now they're here.
[01:29:54.988 --> 01:30:05.692]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Light's Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[01:30:06.072 --> 01:30:10.594]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Element.
[01:30:10.654 --> 01:30:21.998]  When used, water flow through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[01:30:22.578 --> 01:30:29.441]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements, where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[01:30:29.821 --> 01:30:31.962]  Your purified water is now ready.
[01:30:32.463 --> 01:30:37.425]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 host filter elements.
[01:30:37.725 --> 01:30:44.027]  Get a set of two for only $49, or get two sets for only $89 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:30:44.107 --> 01:30:48.288]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:30:48.529 --> 01:30:49.329]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[01:30:53.190 --> 01:30:57.632]  If you think your engine is safe by having the oil changed every 3,000 miles, think again.
[01:30:57.912 --> 01:31:01.514]  Every time you start your car, your engine creates friction between the moving parts.
[01:31:01.654 --> 01:31:09.758]  These moving parts wear against each other and the result is small metal particles circulating through your oil, causing premature wear and damage to your engine.
[01:31:10.018 --> 01:31:15.660]  Oil filters do a good job of trapping the large metal particles, but they will not trap the most harmful tiny particles.
[01:31:15.960 --> 01:31:21.221]  These tiny particles circulate constantly through your oil, and over time your engine begins to show signs of wear.
[01:31:21.462 --> 01:31:23.562]  This is why you need the filter mag.
[01:31:23.802 --> 01:31:35.966]  The filter mag is a powerful magnet that holds itself to the outside of your oil filter, trapping the tiny metal particles to the inside wall of the filter, extending the life of your oil and ultimately extending the life of your engine.
[01:31:36.206 --> 01:31:40.631]  The reusable FilterMag is maintenance-free, installs in two seconds, and lasts forever.
[01:31:40.831 --> 01:31:41.793]  So what are you waiting for?
[01:31:41.973 --> 01:31:43.595]  Go to FilterMag.com.
[01:31:43.715 --> 01:31:45.517]  That's FilterMag.com.
[01:31:45.777 --> 01:31:46.238]  Or call 800-345-8376.
[01:31:46.298 --> 01:31:46.478]  That's 800-345-8376.
[01:32:04.674 --> 01:32:05.355]  We're good to go.
[01:32:28.670 --> 01:32:29.231]  We're good to go.
[01:32:50.767 --> 01:32:52.968]  I just want to roll a little bit of this, about a minute or so of it.
[01:32:53.008 --> 01:32:55.749]  Cruiserweight are just big fans of the broadcast, and I'm big fans of them.
[01:32:55.769 --> 01:32:57.969]  I won't be able to be there tonight, but I'm plugging it here.
[01:32:57.989 --> 01:33:02.951]  They're going to be at Red Rum Annex stage Wednesday night, March 15th.
[01:33:03.911 --> 01:33:08.413]  And they're playing at around midnight, Big South by Southwest going on right now.
[01:33:08.433 --> 01:33:09.353]  They've got a lot of talent.
[01:33:10.093 --> 01:33:13.374]  And again, that's going to be at Red Rum down on 4th Street in downtown Austin.
[01:33:13.614 --> 01:33:17.176]  Here's Cruiserweight from, what's the name of this song?
[01:33:17.256 --> 01:33:17.936]  Threat of a Threat?
[01:33:17.976 --> 01:33:18.276]  Here it is.
[01:33:20.789 --> 01:33:22.030]  We're good to go.
[01:33:51.186 --> 01:33:52.467]  We're good to go.
[01:33:52.487 --> 01:33:52.887]  I think?
[01:34:19.675 --> 01:34:21.280]  Have you paid your dues?
[01:34:59.186 --> 01:35:01.648]  And wave goodbye.
[01:35:02.729 --> 01:35:05.871]  Ultraviolet's burning everyone.
[01:35:06.991 --> 01:35:10.013]  Outrage fatigue is spreading in.
[01:35:11.154 --> 01:35:14.216]  But at least I know I'm free.
[01:35:15.797 --> 01:35:20.840]  Just because it's liquid doesn't make it water.
[01:35:21.021 --> 01:35:24.783]  All right, well, it's very talented, faux freedom, anti-New World War music.
[01:35:25.343 --> 01:35:26.164]  And I got their new album.
[01:35:26.184 --> 01:35:27.445]  They just got back from Japan.
[01:35:28.385 --> 01:35:29.285]  Playing to pack houses.
[01:35:29.325 --> 01:35:30.326]  They, of course, live here in Austin.
[01:35:30.946 --> 01:35:39.288]  And I was really excited a couple years ago when I learned from the Dixie Chicks producer that they woke up at 9-11 from my film, The Road to Tyranny, and that's when they shot their mouth off about Lord Bush.
[01:35:39.648 --> 01:35:44.609]  So we are having an effect here, but you more than anybody, the listeners, who are out there waking people up.
[01:35:44.629 --> 01:35:47.270]  So that's Cruiserweight tonight, Red Room, downtown Austin.
[01:35:48.450 --> 01:35:50.811]  Dr. Paul, Greg Roberts, thanks for holding during a few minutes of that.
[01:35:50.831 --> 01:35:52.451]  We'll play that whole song the next hour, folks.
[01:35:53.211 --> 01:35:59.755]  Dr. Roberts, I'm just always stunned by your analysis and your on-target attacks on what's happening currently.
[01:36:00.015 --> 01:36:02.256]  Thank you for spending about 25 minutes with us today.
[01:36:02.836 --> 01:36:03.797]  Well, you're welcome, Alex.
[01:36:03.857 --> 01:36:04.977]  Nice to talk to you again.
[01:36:05.998 --> 01:36:08.159]  I want to go through these two articles you've written.
[01:36:08.179 --> 01:36:10.180]  Was Serbia a practice run for Iraq?
[01:36:10.220 --> 01:36:11.921]  And the other, why did Bush destroy Iraq?
[01:36:11.941 --> 01:36:13.302]  Which one do you want to comment on first?
[01:36:13.782 --> 01:36:14.362]  You go ahead.
[01:36:14.422 --> 01:36:15.303]  You're the host.
[01:36:16.104 --> 01:36:17.145]  Well, Serbia.
[01:36:17.705 --> 01:36:18.866]  A practice run for Iraq.
[01:36:18.907 --> 01:36:20.408]  I mean, that's what I've been saying all along.
[01:36:20.668 --> 01:36:24.671]  No flanness of Slobo, but frankly, everything they said about him was a lie.
[01:36:24.992 --> 01:36:26.233]  They staged the massacres.
[01:36:26.273 --> 01:36:26.813]  They went in there.
[01:36:26.833 --> 01:36:27.594]  They took it over.
[01:36:28.094 --> 01:36:30.617]  If anybody was dirty, it was the Croats and the Muslims.
[01:36:31.437 --> 01:36:36.041]  And now we see clearly murdered in his jail cell, even Limbaugh saying that.
[01:36:36.742 --> 01:36:38.383]  And it's just another shame.
[01:36:38.744 --> 01:36:40.745]  I mean, I want to get your take on it.
[01:36:43.167 --> 01:36:43.388]  Well...
[01:36:44.415 --> 01:36:45.855]  He was certainly demonized.
[01:36:47.916 --> 01:36:54.657]  The Western press, not only in the United States, but in Europe, simply writes whatever governments hand them.
[01:36:56.097 --> 01:37:05.319]  And the charges against Milosevic are made up, just like the charges that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction.
[01:37:06.740 --> 01:37:12.401]  In fact, Milosevic was not even in charge of Yugoslavia when it was breaking up.
[01:37:14.251 --> 01:37:29.578]  The 1991 order that told the Yugoslavian army to fight the secessionist states was given by the then head of the Yugoslav government, which was Markovic, and he was a darling of the West.
[01:37:30.918 --> 01:37:34.740]  Milosevic at the time was simply the head of Serbia.
[01:37:35.921 --> 01:37:40.783]  So the whole thing was made up and orchestrated, and what's so amazing is how easy it is
[01:37:41.758 --> 01:37:51.085]  To tell massive lies that are transparent and have just about everyone in the world fall for it and believe it is an astonishing thing.
[01:37:51.325 --> 01:37:56.490]  Don't we live in the age where the hoaxes are taken as real and reality as scoffed at?
[01:37:56.590 --> 01:37:58.131]  That's a very good way to put it, Alex.
[01:37:58.291 --> 01:37:59.492]  I think that's exactly it.
[01:37:59.532 --> 01:38:06.177]  I find it very difficult to speak the truth about any subject.
[01:38:06.297 --> 01:38:08.499]  And many subjects are simply off limits.
[01:38:09.720 --> 01:38:09.820]  And
[01:38:10.698 --> 01:38:17.421]  But the lies and the hoaxes and the made-up is everywhere.
[01:38:19.262 --> 01:38:24.404]  The American people are really, they have no idea of what's going on around them.
[01:38:26.144 --> 01:38:29.586]  Unless they listen to you and a few other shows like yours a lot.
[01:38:29.886 --> 01:38:32.947]  Well, the good news is, Robert Murdoch says the mainline media is dying.
[01:38:32.987 --> 01:38:37.189]  I mean, Dr. Roberts, I put an ad in the local paper and get 10 responses.
[01:38:37.529 --> 01:38:39.590]  I put an ad on Craigslist for employees and get 200.
[01:38:40.817 --> 01:38:43.899]  I mean, so, and Murdoch is saying they are losing control.
[01:38:43.919 --> 01:38:46.981]  Do you think they are starting to realize that they're losing all their credibility?
[01:38:47.942 --> 01:38:48.382]  I don't know.
[01:38:49.403 --> 01:38:51.364]  I certainly don't think they have any credibility.
[01:38:52.244 --> 01:38:59.229]  The so-called mainline media is basically highly concentrated, and it's afraid to offend the government.
[01:38:59.269 --> 01:39:01.290]  It's afraid to offend advertisers.
[01:39:01.370 --> 01:39:05.433]  So nothing comes out of it other than propaganda.
[01:39:06.873 --> 01:39:08.154]  I agree with you, but...
[01:39:10.626 --> 01:39:14.509]  Looking at Sloan Milajevic and his death, I mean, I'm billing it as a murder.
[01:39:14.529 --> 01:39:15.410]  There's no other way to look at it.
[01:39:15.450 --> 01:39:18.753]  It's like he says, I'm going to be killed.
[01:39:18.773 --> 01:39:19.854]  They're poisoning me.
[01:39:19.874 --> 01:39:21.896]  They have the lights on 24 hours a day.
[01:39:22.356 --> 01:39:24.458]  Three guards are in there whenever anyone visits him.
[01:39:24.658 --> 01:39:29.883]  And then they claim, oh, someone smuggled him this leprosy medicine, and he took it himself.
[01:39:30.483 --> 01:39:33.506]  Yeah, well, that doesn't make any sense at all.
[01:39:34.362 --> 01:39:37.285]  There are two ways you can look at him being murdered.
[01:39:37.425 --> 01:39:41.328]  One is they murdered him by denying him the medical treatment that he requested.
[01:39:42.129 --> 01:39:43.410]  That alone would murder him.
[01:39:45.231 --> 01:39:52.938]  Second, the drug found in his blood is known to counteract his heart and blood pressure medicine, that is to neutralize him.
[01:39:54.018 --> 01:39:59.503]  And so that would be the second source of murder.
[01:39:59.783 --> 01:40:02.065]  Their claim that he was somehow taking drugs
[01:40:02.836 --> 01:40:16.666]  The neutralizing medicine in order to get to Russia is nonsensical because he told John Laughlin recently, who was being called as a witness, that there was no case against him.
[01:40:16.706 --> 01:40:23.911]  They had no evidence, which we now know after a trial lasting over four years, and they can't convict him.
[01:40:23.931 --> 01:40:24.912]  They didn't have a case.
[01:40:26.493 --> 01:40:27.814]  They have no case against me.
[01:40:28.355 --> 01:40:29.956]  I'm going to win this.
[01:40:30.478 --> 01:40:35.070]  And the Russian government said, if he comes in for treatment, we will deliver him back.
[01:40:35.876 --> 01:40:38.377]  And Milosevic wanted to be vindicated.
[01:40:38.397 --> 01:40:39.498]  He didn't want to kill himself.
[01:40:39.578 --> 01:40:41.119]  He didn't expect to lose the case.
[01:40:41.239 --> 01:40:42.439]  Well, in fact, that's what he told people.
[01:40:42.459 --> 01:40:43.760]  He said, I'm fighting for my life.
[01:40:43.780 --> 01:40:44.861]  They're not giving me medicine.
[01:40:44.901 --> 01:40:46.261]  They're putting some of my medicine.
[01:40:46.281 --> 01:40:53.705]  And a week before, one of the chief witnesses against him that was about to go back to his side, we're now hearing, oh, he magically dies.
[01:40:53.725 --> 01:40:55.766]  And then another witness a few months before died.
[01:40:55.786 --> 01:40:58.268]  I mean, that's why he was saying, they're about to kill me.
[01:40:58.508 --> 01:41:00.989]  Two days before they killed him, he's saying, they're poisoning me.
[01:41:01.029 --> 01:41:02.310]  There's powder in my food.
[01:41:02.950 --> 01:41:03.170]  Yeah.
[01:41:03.591 --> 01:41:13.221]  Well, I think that unable to convict him, they couldn't admit that it was all a hoax, that they'd made a mistake, so they killed him.
[01:41:14.202 --> 01:41:15.523]  I think that's what happened, yes.
[01:41:15.999 --> 01:41:20.041]  I don't know whether they killed him with the medicine or whether they killed him by denying him treatment.
[01:41:20.121 --> 01:41:21.482]  Either way, they killed him.
[01:41:21.722 --> 01:41:23.603]  Whichever way they did it, he was killed.
[01:41:23.763 --> 01:41:27.745]  But it points towards it with this leprosy drug being put in there.
[01:41:27.985 --> 01:41:29.205]  Yeah, how would he get that?
[01:41:29.345 --> 01:41:30.586]  I mean, I agree with you, Alex.
[01:41:30.606 --> 01:41:33.767]  There's no way he could have gotten it, and he had no reason to take it.
[01:41:35.128 --> 01:41:37.129]  Listen, folks, Slobo loved to eat.
[01:41:37.782 --> 01:41:39.524]  Okay, and he was a little bit overweight.
[01:41:39.804 --> 01:41:45.729]  That guy was as skinny as a rail, they're now reporting, because he was battling not to eat, saying there's poison in the food.
[01:41:46.089 --> 01:41:47.250]  He would drink out of the sink.
[01:41:47.930 --> 01:41:51.633]  So the guy was literally in there basically on a hunger strike, fighting to not be killed.
[01:41:52.214 --> 01:41:52.454]  Yeah.
[01:41:53.155 --> 01:42:03.923]  You see, most people, though, will simply say, well, he was a brutal dictator, a murderer, a genocide, so what, they killed him, he got what he deserved.
[01:42:04.243 --> 01:42:07.226]  Because they believe all the propaganda that we put out
[01:42:07.884 --> 01:42:09.404]  You know what's sick, Dr. Roberts?
[01:42:09.944 --> 01:42:13.285]  That creature, that bag of scrofulous matter, Madeleine Albright...
[01:42:32.972 --> 01:42:40.155]  By the way, her father was the head purger in Central Slovakia for Stalin, and she has stolen art all over her walls.
[01:42:40.195 --> 01:42:43.037]  That's been mainstream news of people her father murdered.
[01:42:44.577 --> 01:42:55.822]  She ran with her parents to Serbia, and they protected them from the Nazis, and then she's on TV laughing at them, saying they deserve to be bombed.
[01:42:55.862 --> 01:42:57.883]  I mean, what's wrong with these people?
[01:42:59.224 --> 01:42:59.704]  They're evil.
[01:43:02.080 --> 01:43:09.942]  It's very difficult to find anybody in the United States government these days who's not evil, because no decent person would be there associated with the policies.
[01:43:10.443 --> 01:43:13.804]  I mean, who would want to be in a government that's a war criminal government?
[01:43:16.124 --> 01:43:19.425]  No decent person would be in the United States government today.
[01:43:21.226 --> 01:43:23.386]  You couldn't be able to look yourself in the mirror, would you?
[01:43:25.327 --> 01:43:31.689]  You're destroying freedom and democracy at home while you're claiming that you're killing tens of thousands of
[01:43:32.122 --> 01:43:35.704]  Women and children in Iraq in order to bring them freedom and democracy?
[01:43:36.385 --> 01:43:40.728]  I mean, really, this is beyond the Nazi type of insanity.
[01:43:41.548 --> 01:43:44.050]  Well, that's true.
[01:43:44.110 --> 01:43:55.278]  We talked about John Yoo, and he's saying that they can crush children's genitalia in front of their parents in torture camps, but Saddam's bad because he allegedly had rape rooms.
[01:43:56.478 --> 01:43:59.360]  Yeah, see, we don't know anything about Saddam.
[01:43:59.480 --> 01:44:01.862]  All we know is the lies they've told us.
[01:44:03.687 --> 01:44:08.532]  Whether 1% of what they've told us is true, we've got no way of knowing.
[01:44:08.693 --> 01:44:10.595]  But we do know that they lie.
[01:44:11.436 --> 01:44:24.149]  So, unless you're an expert and you spend a huge amount of time researching Saddam Hussein and filtering out and trying to see what the story is, you don't know.
[01:44:25.405 --> 01:44:26.665]  We're not told anything.
[01:44:27.546 --> 01:44:38.929]  Well, I've interviewed a lot of colleagues who were in the intelligence agencies when you were in the Reagan administration, and then, of course, the people who were in the Bush 41 administrations, and Saddam was about as good as it gets in the Middle East.
[01:44:38.969 --> 01:44:41.350]  That's why with different administrations, the U.S.
[01:44:41.390 --> 01:44:41.810]  liked him.
[01:44:42.310 --> 01:44:51.433]  He was secular, left Christians and Jews alone in his country, and they had rock and roll on the radio stations, and they left you alone, by and large, and...
[01:44:52.742 --> 01:44:53.222]  We're good to go.
[01:44:53.242 --> 01:44:53.522]  I think?
[01:45:22.640 --> 01:45:24.100]  And April Gillespie smiles at him.
[01:45:25.341 --> 01:45:29.542]  And then he does it, and they go in there and commit genocide for 13 years with the sanctions.
[01:45:29.582 --> 01:45:30.522]  Now there's an invasion.
[01:45:30.562 --> 01:45:31.783]  I mean, it's just despicable.
[01:45:32.483 --> 01:45:33.303]  Well, that's what I said.
[01:45:34.424 --> 01:45:39.245]  There's no such thing as a decent person any longer in the United States government.
[01:45:39.925 --> 01:45:43.926]  It's a war criminal government based on lies and deception.
[01:45:43.946 --> 01:45:45.447]  There's nothing else that can be said for it.
[01:45:46.627 --> 01:45:49.168]  Now, you talk about Iraq and this other excellent piece you've written.
[01:45:50.167 --> 01:45:51.568]  Why did Bush destroy Iraq?
[01:45:51.608 --> 01:45:58.354]  Now, PNAC says that they want to be there decades, and the Israeli plan from 1983 said, we want to have the U.S.
[01:45:58.374 --> 01:46:00.796]  go in and break it into three parts, and we want civil war.
[01:46:01.276 --> 01:46:03.458]  And the Pentagon plan P2OG says the same thing.
[01:46:03.478 --> 01:46:06.781]  They say if there's civil war, there'll be an excuse to be there forever.
[01:46:06.821 --> 01:46:10.564]  And now Rumsfeld's announced today he wants to go up to 180,000 troops.
[01:46:11.945 --> 01:46:13.286]  Well, I don't know where he's going to get them.
[01:46:17.089 --> 01:46:19.091]  I don't know where he's going to get the troops, and...
[01:46:22.368 --> 01:46:25.490]  I don't know that the... What would that be?
[01:46:25.510 --> 01:46:27.532]  There'd be about another 40,000 extra.
[01:46:28.793 --> 01:46:29.914]  What good that would do them?
[01:46:30.214 --> 01:46:35.558]  You know, the recent poll of the troops there showed that the vast majority of the troops won't come home.
[01:46:36.238 --> 01:46:37.319]  72%, yeah.
[01:46:37.379 --> 01:46:48.188]  And they don't believe in the war, and they don't believe that they're being effective or having any positive impacts.
[01:46:48.308 --> 01:46:48.788]  So I don't...
[01:46:49.589 --> 01:46:51.230]  I just don't know.
[01:46:51.270 --> 01:46:59.333]  I don't know how long the American people will put up with this tyrannical government that lies to them every time it opens its mouth.
[01:47:00.434 --> 01:47:10.498]  I think, Alex, you put your finger on it yourself a while back when you said that the 9-11 episode is their cover.
[01:47:10.558 --> 01:47:14.220]  As long as the Americans believe the government's lying on 9-11...
[01:47:16.020 --> 01:47:28.711]  They're going to let Bush get away with things because they think that whether he's being effective or not, that his intentions are to protect America.
[01:47:29.832 --> 01:47:38.620]  The 9-11, which I have grave doubts about that story, as you know, I believe that that is
[01:47:42.651 --> 01:47:45.934]  That is a linchpin in their whole operation, foundational?
[01:47:47.275 --> 01:47:54.662]  Yeah, I think if somehow 11 story was blown, that would be the end of them.
[01:47:55.283 --> 01:48:05.713]  And the real danger, as you've also pointed out, is they might pull another operation in order to solidify his power and let them attack Iran.
[01:48:06.559 --> 01:48:08.280]  Well, that's what I feel in my bones.
[01:48:08.300 --> 01:48:12.741]  I mean, I go off all the information, the analysis, the facts, but I always go with my guts, my snout.
[01:48:13.321 --> 01:48:15.382]  And I smell death, Dr. Roberts.
[01:48:21.544 --> 01:48:32.627]  Well, I think that what we have to ask ourselves is why, when they are trapped in Iraq...
[01:48:33.908 --> 01:48:34.849]  A three-year war.
[01:48:35.149 --> 01:48:37.010]  They failed to establish control.
[01:48:37.090 --> 01:48:39.072]  Now they say they need more troops.
[01:48:39.872 --> 01:48:40.453]  Another 40,000, 50,000.
[01:48:40.813 --> 01:48:42.274]  They don't have those troops.
[01:48:44.195 --> 01:48:50.980]  Why, when they're in that type of situation, do they want to start another war with Iran?
[01:48:51.100 --> 01:48:53.542]  Well, we know... Wait a minute, Alex.
[01:48:53.622 --> 01:48:54.883]  It's a much larger country.
[01:48:55.423 --> 01:49:00.787]  Far more resources, military-wise, able to do us positive harm and damage.
[01:49:02.142 --> 01:49:06.083]  It could cause the Iraqi Shia to turn on us from the rear.
[01:49:07.983 --> 01:49:15.085]  No way could the United States possibly win that type of contest unless they intend to nuke them.
[01:49:17.386 --> 01:49:18.086]  There's no other way.
[01:49:18.306 --> 01:49:24.627]  Well, I was just going to say that the 40,000 extra troops they admit they want to put in the Bazaar area, perfect to invade western Iran.
[01:49:24.647 --> 01:49:26.228]  It's not enough.
[01:49:28.692 --> 01:49:29.332]  It's not enough.
[01:49:29.392 --> 01:49:31.694]  They can't invade Iran with 40,000 troops.
[01:49:31.954 --> 01:49:32.775]  Oh, I agree with you.
[01:49:32.795 --> 01:49:34.516]  Well, let's analyze that more on the other side.
[01:49:35.536 --> 01:49:39.759]  But they can, with 40,000, go in and hold some of those oil fields right across the border.
[01:49:39.779 --> 01:49:40.840]  That's what they've said they want.
[01:49:41.900 --> 01:49:43.401]  Claim it's a security zone.
[01:49:43.501 --> 01:49:45.683]  Oh, the Iranians are attacking us through this area.
[01:49:45.923 --> 01:49:48.744]  We've got to just grab this area that just so happens to have oil on it.
[01:49:54.409 --> 01:49:57.251]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[01:49:57.531 --> 01:49:58.232]  Hello, my friends.
[01:49:58.312 --> 01:49:59.092]  Alex Jones here.
[01:49:59.452 --> 01:50:04.115]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law, 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[01:50:04.456 --> 01:50:11.220]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[01:50:11.520 --> 01:50:13.502]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[01:50:13.702 --> 01:50:16.544]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[01:50:16.644 --> 01:50:21.307]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[01:50:21.508 --> 01:50:25.911]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[01:50:26.151 --> 01:50:33.376]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[01:50:33.637 --> 01:50:36.079]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.

[01:50:53.857 --> 01:50:57.761]  Black Berkey replacement elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[01:50:58.001 --> 01:51:03.426]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[01:51:03.706 --> 01:51:14.076]  Ideal for travel or outdoor events and perfect in the event of hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies because they remove both harmful chemicals and pathogenic bacteria from water.
[01:51:14.236 --> 01:51:18.580]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:51:18.760 --> 01:51:27.104]  Trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and NTBE are removed to below detectable limits.
[01:51:27.384 --> 01:51:33.748]  They reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, aluminum, copper, and foul taste like chlorine and sulfur odors.
[01:51:33.868 --> 01:51:38.350]  Yet the Black Berkey filter elements leave in the helpful and beneficial minerals that your body needs.
[01:51:38.570 --> 01:51:42.772]  Normally $48 each, get a two-pack for only $91 or a four-pack for only $173.

[01:51:48.135 --> 01:51:48.695]  We're good to go.
[01:51:48.715 --> 01:51:49.035]  I think?
[01:52:10.524 --> 01:52:11.164]  We're good to go.
[01:52:30.831 --> 01:52:32.292]  It's not just Dr. Paul Craig Roberts or classical
[01:53:00.652 --> 01:53:02.313]  Lefties like Kurt Vonnegut.
[01:53:03.374 --> 01:53:10.999]  I mean, it's Bob Woodward giving a speech two weeks ago in San Antonio saying we're going into a dictatorship.
[01:53:11.100 --> 01:53:13.501]  One more attack, martial law, Bush is dictator.
[01:53:13.521 --> 01:53:15.222]  I mean, those are quotes.
[01:53:15.302 --> 01:53:18.785]  Senator Day O'Connor just said that three days ago in a speech over the weekend.
[01:53:19.893 --> 01:53:21.214]  I mean, this is classical.
[01:53:21.274 --> 01:53:22.154]  This isn't a joke.
[01:53:22.194 --> 01:53:22.855]  This isn't a game.
[01:53:23.295 --> 01:53:33.960]  Dr. Roberts, have you heard about DynCorp down in Louisiana to take over major parish sheriff's departments and then get paid twice what the sheriff's deputies get paid?
[01:53:34.160 --> 01:53:36.521]  They're not going to hire back the cops that they furloughed.
[01:53:36.561 --> 01:53:39.523]  The feds say, if you want money, you've got to hire DynCorp.
[01:53:39.583 --> 01:53:45.286]  I mean, that precedent right there, Halliburton to run FEMA centers, I mean, this is getting scarier and scarier.
[01:53:46.331 --> 01:53:50.633]  Yeah, it looks also like an enrichment of cronies, too, doesn't it?
[01:53:50.693 --> 01:53:51.934]  I mean, and it's so blatant.
[01:53:51.954 --> 01:53:52.774]  It's so obvious.
[01:53:55.255 --> 01:54:01.579]  They're privatizing public services in order to funnel taxpayer money to their donors.
[01:54:02.379 --> 01:54:07.261]  And at the same time, they're unaccountable, and then it gives corporate control over our daily lives.
[01:54:07.281 --> 01:54:08.562]  That's the definition of fascism.
[01:54:09.543 --> 01:54:10.283]  It certainly is.
[01:54:10.603 --> 01:54:14.465]  And I was just looking at Sandra Day O'Connor's remarks to Georgetown University.
[01:54:15.362 --> 01:54:19.926]  She says it is the beginnings of a dictatorship, and they're attacking the judiciary as well.
[01:54:20.066 --> 01:54:23.770]  So, you know, what are we going to do?
[01:54:23.850 --> 01:54:24.190]  I don't know.
[01:54:25.051 --> 01:54:29.595]  Well, the good news is a year ago I was saying dictatorship, and people, I mean, I was pretty lonely.
[01:54:30.676 --> 01:54:33.799]  But, I mean, everybody I talk to now sees it, Dr. Roberts.
[01:54:35.362 --> 01:54:37.843]  Well, you mean a few thinking people see it.
[01:54:38.383 --> 01:54:38.863]  Well, sure.
[01:54:38.903 --> 01:54:45.225]  In fact, I want to get your take on these drooling neocon listeners who listen to this fake right-wing radio.
[01:54:45.265 --> 01:54:48.686]  It's not conservative, and they just believe any lie that they're told.
[01:54:48.706 --> 01:54:50.147]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:54:50.487 --> 01:54:50.867]  They do.
[01:54:50.887 --> 01:54:58.129]  They're low-IQ people, and they're full of resentments, and the right-wing talk radio knows how to manipulate them.
[01:54:59.349 --> 01:55:04.251]  And that's the core of Bush's support.
[01:55:06.866 --> 01:55:09.908]  Well, and most of them are low IQ.
[01:55:09.928 --> 01:55:10.548]  They're just stupid.
[01:55:10.568 --> 01:55:16.271]  But I've talked to some people who are scared deep down, so they decide to believe the lie, Dr. Roberts.
[01:55:16.291 --> 01:55:18.092]  They decide to fool themselves.
[01:55:19.413 --> 01:55:20.413]  You mean they're scared of...
[01:55:23.024 --> 01:55:26.265]  Being in a dictatorship or they're scared of the terrorists?
[01:55:26.525 --> 01:55:28.046]  Well, they're in denial.
[01:55:28.706 --> 01:55:29.926]  I mean, they get real upset.
[01:55:29.966 --> 01:55:32.547]  You can see it in their eyes that they know you're telling them the truth.
[01:55:32.627 --> 01:55:34.548]  But they just, I just can't believe that.
[01:55:34.588 --> 01:55:35.288]  It's just not true.
[01:55:35.308 --> 01:55:36.168]  They're just in denial.
[01:55:36.508 --> 01:55:36.708]  Yeah.
[01:55:37.649 --> 01:55:40.329]  Well, it takes a lot of strength to recognize the truth.
[01:55:42.170 --> 01:55:43.490]  Where do you see it going in Iraq?
[01:55:43.550 --> 01:55:48.352]  I mean, I think they're just going to try to get us so deep into a war with Iran in the future.
[01:55:49.284 --> 01:56:00.728]  Or they're going to attack Iran and hope that Iran strikes back, and then, oh, everybody will be shocked that they fight back, and then we're going to be off the races, and I think they'll force us into a full-bore mobilization and bring in the draft and everything else.
[01:56:02.389 --> 01:56:05.450]  You know, I just don't know what their plan is.
[01:56:06.950 --> 01:56:09.711]  If that's their plan, it's highly risky, isn't it?
[01:56:09.771 --> 01:56:17.334]  I mean, it's the most... I've never known a government to undertake so many extreme risks
[01:56:18.602 --> 01:56:19.883]  And for no clear reason.
[01:56:21.944 --> 01:56:25.567]  So I don't know whether... You keep using the Hitler parallel.
[01:56:25.587 --> 01:56:28.288]  He was nuts and started attacking everybody, too.
[01:56:28.869 --> 01:56:35.173]  Well, yes, but he at least had an agenda.
[01:56:36.354 --> 01:56:41.657]  And he may have done okay had he not marched off into Russia.
[01:56:41.697 --> 01:56:46.980]  It may well be that if Bush marches off into Iran, he will have done the equivalent of...
[01:56:49.768 --> 01:56:51.529]  Hitler marching off into Russia.
[01:56:51.549 --> 01:56:54.591]  It may be more than they can chew.
[01:56:55.152 --> 01:56:56.553]  Same thing Napoleon did.
[01:56:57.314 --> 01:56:58.174]  Yeah, right.
[01:56:58.875 --> 01:57:07.982]  You know, I wrote a few months back that maybe our best hope was just to let the fool loose.
[01:57:09.023 --> 01:57:12.806]  And the more he attacks, the quicker he'll fall.
[01:57:15.439 --> 01:57:23.201]  And then we're left with a police state he put in place and a Hillary Clinton or somebody else steps into those shoes.
[01:57:24.002 --> 01:57:25.182]  Be as dangerous as Bush.
[01:57:25.682 --> 01:57:27.043]  Oh, yeah.
[01:57:27.423 --> 01:57:29.243]  Five more minutes with you, Doctor, on the other side.
[01:57:29.263 --> 01:57:32.144]  I've got a few more questions, and thank you so much for joining us.
[01:57:33.205 --> 01:57:37.106]  If you would like a copy of this show, come to GCNlive.com and reserve it today.
[01:57:37.446 --> 01:57:38.186]  Or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[01:57:49.438 --> 01:57:50.078]  Big Brother.
[01:57:50.738 --> 01:57:51.799]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:52.519 --> 01:57:53.620]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.280 --> 01:57:55.080]  You want answers?
[01:57:55.841 --> 01:57:56.721]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:56.761 --> 01:58:01.103]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:01.584 --> 01:58:05.705]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:06.826 --> 01:58:15.730]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts is with us for five more minutes, then we've got some of the Iraqi women coming on who've been over there through it, who are now traveling the U.S.
[01:58:15.790 --> 01:58:17.371]  exposing what's really happening.
[01:58:19.605 --> 01:58:29.173]  Dr. Roberts, you worked at the highest levels of D.C., the chief economist there at the Department of Treasury during the Reagan administration, and folks can read your writings all over the web.
[01:58:29.193 --> 01:58:37.761]  You've written some of the biggest mainstream publications in the country as well, but you're quite a phenomenon with your blogging.
[01:58:37.781 --> 01:58:47.329]  I'm trying to understand how Bush is going to be able to get away with
[01:58:48.640 --> 01:58:50.480]  With this New World Order.
[01:58:51.501 --> 01:58:56.962]  And I just want to thank Dr. Roberts for joining us.
[01:58:57.022 --> 01:59:00.002]  We'll be having him back up in the near future.
[01:59:00.042 --> 01:59:05.743]  He was scheduled with us for a little bit longer, but he had repairmen show up at his door for some yard work.
[01:59:05.763 --> 01:59:06.924]  I think with his sprinklers, he said.
[01:59:06.964 --> 01:59:08.804]  So he just left us.
[01:59:08.824 --> 01:59:09.944]  We certainly understand that.
[01:59:09.984 --> 01:59:13.545]  But we had him on with us the last 30 minutes, and he said quite a lot.
[01:59:14.493 --> 01:59:17.174]  Right now, let's just go to Rick in Reno, then Fred in Philadelphia.
[01:59:17.314 --> 01:59:18.075]  Rick, you're on the air.
[01:59:20.216 --> 01:59:23.077]  Yes, Alex, thank you for the invitation to join you today.
[01:59:23.897 --> 01:59:26.579]  I have a new group on MySpace.com.
[01:59:26.619 --> 01:59:30.100]  It's called Will Rupert Murdoch Shut This Down?
[01:59:31.040 --> 01:59:36.583]  To join it, you simply go to MySpace.com slash Will Rupert Murdoch Shut This Down?
[01:59:37.503 --> 01:59:39.324]  And then I would just go post links.
[01:59:39.544 --> 01:59:48.427]  You can do Google searches for the mainstream news articles three or four months ago where they said they've got spiders, that's an Internet term, that go in and read everything and then flag it.
[01:59:48.787 --> 01:59:53.449]  Anything criticizing him or certain other key things, then they shut you down.
[01:59:54.249 --> 01:59:58.091]  So just link to some of those articles and say, are you going to let us report on you, Murdoch?
[01:59:59.133 --> 01:59:59.773]  Right on, brother.
[02:00:00.113 --> 02:00:00.474]  Thank you.
[02:00:00.894 --> 02:00:01.454]  Hey, you bet.
[02:00:01.514 --> 02:00:07.857]  Tell me again that web address so I can make sure that we get links to it on our new MySpace site.
[02:00:07.877 --> 02:00:08.297]  We'll do.
[02:00:09.217 --> 02:00:13.339]  MySpace.com slash WillRupertMurdochShutThisDown.
[02:00:13.639 --> 02:00:14.919]  WillRupertMurdochShutThisDown.
[02:00:14.939 --> 02:00:15.159]  All right.
[02:00:15.220 --> 02:00:15.820]  All one word.
[02:00:16.340 --> 02:00:17.260]  Thank you, Ray.
[02:00:17.300 --> 02:00:17.981]  Good to hear from you.
[02:00:18.361 --> 02:00:19.261]  Fred in Philly.
[02:00:19.281 --> 02:00:19.801]  You're on the air.
[02:00:19.841 --> 02:00:20.422]  Go ahead, Fred.
[02:00:21.742 --> 02:00:22.202]  Hi.
[02:00:22.422 --> 02:00:28.705]  I want to tell you that I really appreciate the way that you handled all these issues non-ideologically.
[02:00:29.497 --> 02:00:37.108]  And also that you don't bait ethnic groups and that you don't bait religions, and I think that's very commendable.
[02:00:37.248 --> 02:00:38.650]  Well, those are all hot buttons.
[02:00:38.690 --> 02:00:46.481]  A lot of people like to, you know, they stick their finger in it and they think because they've got a feeling that that electricity going into them is good.
[02:00:47.125 --> 02:00:49.386]  And I think because they're getting attention that it's good.
[02:00:49.626 --> 02:00:53.087]  But overall, it's very, very destructive.
[02:00:53.107 --> 02:00:54.948]  And that's what the neocons do.
[02:00:55.188 --> 02:01:04.291]  Yeah, and I think that it took me several years to get into that mode of thinking.
[02:01:04.311 --> 02:01:05.351]  But it's very valuable.
[02:01:05.711 --> 02:01:08.933]  Now, I want to bring up something from Jane's Defense Weekly.
[02:01:10.113 --> 02:01:13.154]  And thank you for putting that SEL story on your site.
[02:01:13.174 --> 02:01:14.554]  The...
[02:01:17.162 --> 02:01:30.912]  The SEL story seems to indicate to me that there's going to be just a basically unbelievable amount of resources and expertise poured into media trying to control it.
[02:01:32.232 --> 02:01:42.740]  Well, we post a lot of Jane's Defense Quarterly, which... It had to do with strategic communication laboratories and blanketed Jane's Defense Weekly with...
[02:01:43.641 --> 02:01:44.501]  Yes.
[02:01:44.561 --> 02:01:45.562]  Centerfold ads.
[02:01:45.602 --> 02:01:48.683]  Yeah, that's their article saying the most powerful weapon in the world.
[02:01:49.324 --> 02:01:49.664]  Right.
[02:01:49.704 --> 02:01:51.345]  Run by Lord Mombatten.
[02:01:51.605 --> 02:01:52.365]  And I'm not kidding.
[02:01:52.385 --> 02:01:54.766]  There's really a Lord Mombatten, folks.
[02:01:54.946 --> 02:02:04.090]  And they had said that elected officials and not necessarily heads of state can go to them and be clients in peacetime or in war.
[02:02:04.110 --> 02:02:08.292]  Well, it says the government has a right to rule over the people and that they keep the elite in control.
[02:02:08.312 --> 02:02:09.313]  Mm-hmm.
[02:02:10.089 --> 02:02:28.003]  Yeah, well, the magazine Jane's Defense Weekly has kept all of the SEL ads on their site, and SEL just goes around boasting about their own ads as if they don't mean anything, but they do mean something.
[02:02:28.964 --> 02:02:30.965]  So it's extremely significant.
[02:02:31.005 --> 02:02:32.507]  Thank you for putting that on your site.
[02:02:32.907 --> 02:02:33.287]  Thank you.
[02:02:33.367 --> 02:02:33.868]  Anything else?
[02:02:34.128 --> 02:02:34.448]  That's it.
[02:02:34.928 --> 02:02:35.389]  Thank you, sir.
[02:02:35.409 --> 02:02:37.430]  We've got some interesting guests coming up.
[02:02:37.450 --> 02:02:37.851]  Stay with us.
[02:02:41.850 --> 02:02:46.692]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:02:46.872 --> 02:02:49.974]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[02:02:50.094 --> 02:02:53.996]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[02:02:54.036 --> 02:02:58.278]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State to the Takeover.
[02:02:58.618 --> 02:03:02.380]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[02:03:02.540 --> 02:03:04.381]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[02:03:04.521 --> 02:03:07.862]  Riot police attacked people on the streets indiscriminately.
[02:03:07.882 --> 02:03:08.983]  The medical bills...
[02:03:10.564 --> 02:03:12.605]  Are going to be enormous for me.
[02:03:12.745 --> 02:03:15.786]  You see them here with their hands cuffed behind their backs.
[02:03:15.966 --> 02:03:18.848]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[02:03:19.308 --> 02:03:25.431]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[02:03:25.971 --> 02:03:26.411]  We're good to go.
[02:03:46.024 --> 02:03:50.527]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[02:03:50.888 --> 02:03:54.971]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[02:03:55.271 --> 02:03:55.811]  We listened.
[02:03:56.131 --> 02:04:01.115]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[02:04:01.375 --> 02:04:01.876]  We listened.
[02:04:02.256 --> 02:04:05.298]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[02:04:05.718 --> 02:04:06.239]  We listened.
[02:04:06.699 --> 02:04:10.761]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[02:04:11.141 --> 02:04:11.642]  We listened.
[02:04:11.982 --> 02:04:17.204]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[02:04:17.625 --> 02:04:19.005]  Again, we listened.
[02:04:19.345 --> 02:04:26.729]  Introducing the Berkey Light, the gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.
[02:04:27.109 --> 02:04:30.571]  Get the Berkey Light, the American water filter for only $259 by calling
[02:04:36.715 --> 02:04:37.997]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:04:44.671 --> 02:04:46.872]  Nancy McKimson of Jacksonville, Florida says...
[02:05:07.941 --> 02:05:11.504]  Since I started using Forever Fresh, everything stays fresh much longer.
[02:05:11.764 --> 02:05:14.986]  Like strawberries, which now last a couple of weeks instead of just a few days.
[02:05:15.266 --> 02:05:18.809]  Jane Burke of New Jersey says... You know, we eat a lot of salads.
[02:05:18.969 --> 02:05:22.432]  I used to throw out the leftovers because they'd turn brown and they'd shrivel up.
[02:05:22.572 --> 02:05:23.833]  I'm really amazed.
[02:05:23.973 --> 02:05:29.837]  Since I started using Forever Fresh, all my produce stays fresher longer, including the leftovers.
[02:05:29.977 --> 02:05:32.399]  Now I just couldn't get along without Forever Fresh.
[02:05:32.739 --> 02:05:40.863]  To order your Forever Fresh for the fridge, visit the web at foreverfresh.us or call toll-free 1-866-NO-ODERS.
[02:05:41.044 --> 02:05:43.025]  That's 1-866-NO-ODERS.
[02:05:45.926 --> 02:05:51.569]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:56.412 --> 02:06:02.035]  Dr. Rashad Zaidan is a pharmacist who works in Baghdad and Fallujah with women...
[02:06:03.747 --> 02:06:06.908]  And children who were victims of war.
[02:06:06.928 --> 02:06:08.948]  She's worked especially with orphans.
[02:06:10.188 --> 02:06:14.329]  And she works with the Knowledge Society to aid victims of war.
[02:06:15.170 --> 02:06:15.970]  And she joins us.
[02:06:15.990 --> 02:06:18.830]  She's part of the Iraqi Women for Peace that's traveling around Code Pink.
[02:06:18.850 --> 02:06:23.231]  She helped set this up, part of the Women Against War movement in this country.
[02:06:23.271 --> 02:06:24.672]  And they have amazing stories to tell.
[02:06:25.892 --> 02:06:28.633]  Dr. Zaidan, thank you so much for joining us today.
[02:06:29.153 --> 02:06:29.513]  Thank you.
[02:06:29.573 --> 02:06:30.193]  Thank you very much.
[02:06:31.179 --> 02:06:34.620]  We're going to be talking to Gail Murphy here in a second, but first talking to you.
[02:06:36.720 --> 02:06:47.182]  Tell us about your work with women and orphans and what you witnessed in Fallujah and Baghdad during the genocide operations being conducted by the New World Order control system.
[02:06:48.663 --> 02:07:00.025]  Yes, in the beginning we were working with widows and orphans and there were some numbers we can help them, but after three years of occupation and
[02:07:00.669 --> 02:07:04.370]  So at this point you're not getting the help you need for widows and orphans?
[02:07:04.410 --> 02:07:05.850]  What did you witness in Iraq?
[02:07:28.663 --> 02:07:34.529]  All what you say, all miserable, all problem, all blood, all killing, all suffering.
[02:07:34.929 --> 02:07:46.780]  What I'm saying, what I can tell you about what I'm saying every day, but it's everywhere, because of everywhere, and more widows and orphans, and more people...
[02:07:48.055 --> 02:07:50.916]  Suffering for both, for our and for the American people.
[02:07:51.296 --> 02:08:03.481]  Now, a million and a half Iraqis were exterminated conservatively in the first 13 years of the siege, and now conservatively over 100,000 birth defects up with DU, all of it.
[02:08:03.841 --> 02:08:06.021]  Being a doctor, you see even more of it.
[02:08:06.662 --> 02:08:08.002]  We've seen polls and statistics.
[02:08:08.042 --> 02:08:10.783]  Our own government admits it's far worse than before the invasion.
[02:08:11.263 --> 02:08:15.665]  How much worse is it now than before the invasion of three years ago?
[02:08:16.688 --> 02:08:20.649]  If I say a hundred worse, maybe it is more and more.
[02:08:21.189 --> 02:08:22.909]  So a hundred times worse isn't enough?
[02:08:23.209 --> 02:08:24.710]  Yes, maybe more than.
[02:08:24.910 --> 02:08:31.171]  You know, nothing, the electricity, the water, the medical care, the education, all of it is going down and down.
[02:08:31.751 --> 02:08:35.992]  And no projects for rebuilding.
[02:08:36.592 --> 02:08:39.433]  All we're speaking about is just projects on a paper.
[02:08:39.593 --> 02:08:40.733]  We got nothing from it.
[02:08:41.460 --> 02:08:43.221]  And we are suffering too much from this.
[02:08:43.501 --> 02:08:45.141]  Well, that's the scam payoffs.
[02:08:45.181 --> 02:08:45.761]  They don't build anything.
[02:08:45.781 --> 02:08:47.082]  They just put it right in their bank accounts.
[02:08:47.182 --> 02:08:48.362]  It's direct payoffs.
[02:08:48.382 --> 02:08:51.083]  The president puts it right in his bank account, and so does Dick Cheney.
[02:08:53.024 --> 02:09:03.627]  They say they are rebuilding, but they are building for a permanent basis.
[02:09:03.727 --> 02:09:04.808]  No, you're right.
[02:09:04.848 --> 02:09:05.848]  The 23 permanent basis.
[02:09:06.068 --> 02:09:06.608]  Yes, they are.
[02:09:06.848 --> 02:09:08.849]  For the permanent basis, they are not building...
[02:09:16.133 --> 02:09:18.353]  Those are extermination control towers.
[02:09:18.373 --> 02:09:23.834]  You see, the official plan, I'm sure you as an Iraqi know this, the Israeli plan of 83 is to have the U.S.
[02:09:23.914 --> 02:09:31.776]  invade and break it up in three different sections and then have continual war and genocide stirring up the different groups and controlling civil war.
[02:09:32.076 --> 02:09:34.857]  Are Iraqis aware that it's our government carrying out most of the bombings?
[02:09:36.527 --> 02:09:43.312]  Surely, because you know all the international law saying if you are an occupier, you have to take care of the country you have occupied.
[02:09:43.412 --> 02:09:47.916]  So it is their responsibility to hold all these things.
[02:09:48.276 --> 02:09:51.919]  And I think they not hold it in an efficient way.
[02:09:51.939 --> 02:09:53.520]  So we are in this case.
[02:09:54.964 --> 02:09:56.605]  Now, you've come to the United States now.
[02:09:56.665 --> 02:10:01.609]  You're traveling with WomenSayNoToWar.org.
[02:10:01.629 --> 02:10:03.770]  We have links to it on Infowars.com.
[02:10:03.790 --> 02:10:06.652]  Tell us how you came to the United States, Dr. Zaidan.
[02:10:08.013 --> 02:10:19.141]  The Global Peace for Saying No to War, they invited us to share their activities, and we came here just to tell the American people what is happening really in Iraq, which is
[02:10:19.693 --> 02:10:19.873]  Right.
[02:10:19.913 --> 02:10:20.074]  Right.
[02:10:36.573 --> 02:10:38.914]  After three years, we see everything is different.
[02:10:39.254 --> 02:10:46.935]  Are you aware that America, are the average Iraqis aware that we've just been captured too by the same people and that it's just more sophisticated?
[02:10:47.215 --> 02:10:48.876]  See, we've been captured too.
[02:10:49.416 --> 02:10:50.816]  We're controlled as well.
[02:10:50.836 --> 02:10:53.657]  The average American doesn't even know what's going on.
[02:10:53.917 --> 02:10:55.777]  The average American's been mind-controlled.
[02:10:57.558 --> 02:11:03.199]  I think if they know the truth, our letter is just telling them the truth.
[02:11:03.698 --> 02:11:10.660]  And waiting from being captured, my country has been gone and I have to work hard for my children.
[02:11:10.680 --> 02:11:13.881]  I have four children and I have to think about their future.
[02:11:13.941 --> 02:11:19.702]  So if anything happens to me, I will not be cared because all my country are suffering.
[02:11:20.222 --> 02:11:21.743]  So, no problem.
[02:11:22.983 --> 02:11:27.824]  So you're saying you're willing to, I mean, you're doing whatever it takes to stand up for the little ones.
[02:11:28.284 --> 02:11:29.285]  Yes, I will try.
[02:11:29.365 --> 02:11:30.125]  I'll do my best.
[02:11:32.807 --> 02:11:43.572]  But I'm sure even through all the pain, is it rewarding to you to know that you're standing up for the widows and orphans doing that incredibly holy work?
[02:11:44.952 --> 02:11:53.576]  Yes, I brought with me all their suffering and I try hard to transfer it to the American people to just feel what they are feeling.
[02:11:53.936 --> 02:12:01.979]  We are all human beings and we have to help each other and to make good and peace for each other, not to occupy and destroy
[02:12:03.242 --> 02:12:06.725]  So I hope this letter will reach the American people.
[02:12:08.546 --> 02:12:12.028]  I'd like to go back and talk to you in a few minutes, Dr. Zaidan.
[02:12:12.248 --> 02:12:18.172]  Where are some of the places that you're going to be traveling and speaking here in the United States for listeners that would like to visit with you?
[02:12:19.433 --> 02:12:29.220]  I shall go to North Carolina tomorrow and to Missouri and to Chicago and then to New York.
[02:12:30.305 --> 02:12:35.088]  And, you know, the schedule is still now, they still added some more places.
[02:12:35.288 --> 02:12:36.068]  That's right.
[02:12:36.089 --> 02:12:38.550]  You can go to womensaynotowar.org.
[02:12:38.890 --> 02:12:42.933]  How else can people, any other websites, Dr. Zaidan, that we can visit?
[02:12:43.713 --> 02:12:48.256]  Yes, I have a website, www.alma'arifa.org.
[02:12:49.316 --> 02:12:51.858]  Can you spell that out slowly so we can put a link to it?
[02:12:52.318 --> 02:12:52.478]  Yes.
[02:12:52.798 --> 02:12:55.300]  Alma'arifa means knowledge in Arabic.
[02:12:55.380 --> 02:12:57.781]  So, to spell like this, A-L-M-A-R-I-F-A.
[02:13:06.487 --> 02:13:09.569]  All right, and that is the Knowledge Society.
[02:13:09.649 --> 02:13:11.911]  Maybe type that into Google with Iraq.
[02:13:11.971 --> 02:13:13.612]  It should come up for you as well.
[02:13:14.413 --> 02:13:15.534]  What's a good keyword search?
[02:13:15.554 --> 02:13:17.175]  Is it Knowledge Society of Iraq?
[02:13:19.317 --> 02:13:25.281]  We are helping to, you know, knowledge has many meanings, and one of its meanings is knowing the truth.
[02:13:25.834 --> 02:13:30.177]  And knowing what is happening in Iraq is part of our duty, but we have many other projects.
[02:13:30.278 --> 02:13:32.379]  You shall know the truth, and it shall set you free.
[02:13:33.460 --> 02:13:34.121]  Thank you, babe.
[02:13:35.081 --> 02:13:36.482]  Yes, the truth, the truth.
[02:13:36.562 --> 02:13:38.264]  The people perish for lack of knowledge.
[02:13:38.944 --> 02:13:48.472]  I'd like to go back to you, Dr. Zaidan, but can I speak to the founder of Code Pink, which is a women's peace activist group, Gail Murphy, here for a few minutes?
[02:13:48.852 --> 02:13:49.492]  Yes, okay.
[02:13:49.813 --> 02:13:50.133]  Thank you.
[02:13:53.847 --> 02:13:54.468]  Hello.
[02:13:54.488 --> 02:13:56.809]  Gail, thank you so much for joining us.
[02:13:56.930 --> 02:14:03.975]  Can you break down some of the things you guys are doing and where you're going to be and what some of this horrific testimony these women have been giving is like?
[02:14:04.775 --> 02:14:06.437]  Well, it's been very emotional.
[02:14:06.497 --> 02:14:13.282]  The women came more or less around the 5th of March and started in New York where we had a large public event.
[02:14:16.259 --> 02:14:20.523]  Some visits to the UN, press conferences, a march to the UN mission.
[02:14:20.583 --> 02:14:33.014]  I think some of you may have heard that Cindy Sheehan and Medea Benjamin were arrested in their attempt to try and deliver a petition that over 100,000 women had signed calling for peace in Iraq.
[02:14:33.535 --> 02:14:37.318]  Then they came to Washington, and we had also public events.
[02:14:37.438 --> 02:14:42.963]  We spent a day lobbying Congress, having meetings with both representatives and their staff
[02:14:43.746 --> 02:14:46.607]  So that they can hear from these women, who are ordinary women.
[02:14:46.627 --> 02:14:54.111]  These are not the kind of women that when senators and congressmen travel to Iraq and the U.S.
[02:14:54.131 --> 02:15:00.253]  government inside Iraq sets up meetings for them, these are not the kind of people that they would have an opportunity to meet.
[02:15:00.714 --> 02:15:07.357]  At Bush's State of the Union, he trots out some woman whose husband got a $50 million contract to say how much she loves the war.
[02:15:07.757 --> 02:15:07.977]  Right.
[02:15:09.466 --> 02:15:13.508]  So we felt it was important that these women try and meet with Congress folks.
[02:15:13.988 --> 02:15:16.429]  Some have been receptive, others not so receptive.
[02:15:17.229 --> 02:15:21.871]  And that's quite emotional because these women are so... They're here to save lives.
[02:15:22.451 --> 02:15:33.775]  They took the risk to come here, and it is a risk, both physical because of the travel through Iraq to get to Amman, to get their visas initially.
[02:15:33.815 --> 02:15:35.876]  We have the largest, most expensive U.S.
[02:15:35.936 --> 02:15:36.456]  embassy here,
[02:15:37.400 --> 02:15:44.043]  In the world, in Iraq, with 160,000 troops, and they do not have a visa office where Iraqis can go and get a visa.
[02:15:44.083 --> 02:15:49.766]  They have to travel the long distance to Jordan in order to get a visa, and it's a very long process.
[02:15:49.806 --> 02:15:55.889]  Dr. Rashad, in fact, was held back in Amman because her visa process was delayed compared to the other women.
[02:15:55.969 --> 02:16:04.253]  Two of the women who were invited, mothers who lost their husbands and their children, one at an unmarked checkpoint and the car was fired on by U.S.
[02:16:04.633 --> 02:16:05.674]  soldiers, another one
[02:16:06.485 --> 02:16:10.176]  encountered a tank and her entire family was wiped out.
[02:16:10.598 --> 02:16:17.220]  They were denied visas because they could not meet the burden of proof that they were not intending to emigrate permanently to the U.S.
[02:16:17.300 --> 02:16:22.322]  Gail, have you seen the video where the tank drivers just machine gun whole families and they laugh?
[02:16:22.402 --> 02:16:24.082]  I mean, it's just psychopathic.
[02:16:24.223 --> 02:16:30.485]  Yeah, it's a crazy... The situation in Iraq is really... I mean, I've got to be honest with you.
[02:16:30.525 --> 02:16:31.965]  It has been since the beginning.
[02:16:32.445 --> 02:16:34.966]  Code Pink has been going to Iraq since before the war.
[02:16:35.086 --> 02:16:37.607]  In fact, one of the delegate members, Iman Khamas,
[02:16:38.194 --> 02:16:43.148]  Was the co-founding director of the occupation watch center that Code Pink helped set up.
[02:16:43.730 --> 02:16:46.097]  It's been since closed because of the insecurity.
[02:16:47.346 --> 02:16:58.569]  And she has been documenting war crimes since the get-go, and she has stacks of video and piles of pictures and has written article after article about what's going on.
[02:16:59.069 --> 02:17:01.309]  If somebody gets us some of that, we'll post it on our sites.
[02:17:01.329 --> 02:17:02.549]  We need to get this out to people.
[02:17:02.770 --> 02:17:13.892]  Dr. Rashad, we were meeting with the senator from Alaska, Murkowski, today, and as we came out, a friend of ours, John Bruins, who's an Iraq vet, and she met...
[02:17:14.645 --> 02:17:18.808]  And he has been trying, he's been working to get the troops home.
[02:17:19.588 --> 02:17:21.690]  And he was just so moved to see Dr. Rashad.
[02:17:21.730 --> 02:17:24.932]  And he said, he explained where he was based.
[02:17:24.972 --> 02:17:26.373]  He was based near Abu Ghraib.
[02:17:26.413 --> 02:17:31.156]  And he said, you know, we were sent out every day to surround communities.
[02:17:31.216 --> 02:17:34.479]  If there was a sniper or an explosion, we would be sent out to surround the communities.
[02:17:34.519 --> 02:17:36.420]  And then we kicked in every door in the neighborhood.
[02:17:36.740 --> 02:17:38.301]  Has that ever happened to you?
[02:17:38.321 --> 02:17:40.323]  Unbelievable.
[02:17:40.343 --> 02:17:41.483]  We'll be right back.
[02:17:41.523 --> 02:17:43.585]  And I take all the men down to age 11 to the camp.
[02:17:45.774 --> 02:17:46.455]  Hello, folks.

[02:18:45.217 --> 02:18:45.678]  Gold.

[02:18:47.539 --> 02:18:49.161]  From the Romans through the Renaissance.
[02:18:49.421 --> 02:18:51.482]  From the Industrial Age to the Space Age.
[02:18:51.743 --> 02:18:53.624]  Gold has weathered the test of time.
[02:18:53.824 --> 02:18:57.648]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[02:18:57.988 --> 02:18:59.889]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[02:18:59.929 --> 02:19:01.891]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[02:19:01.911 --> 02:19:03.012]  The stage is becoming more and more difficult.
[02:19:03.012 --> 02:19:03.832]  We're good to go.
[02:19:22.841 --> 02:19:29.706]  Many people have wondered what has happened to the once great United States of America, why the moral decay that has been taking place within it.
[02:19:52.802 --> 02:19:56.884]  The United States has been targeted for overthrow for world government.
[02:19:57.604 --> 02:20:04.627]  The United Nations has been established to redistribute the wealth of the world away from the United States, Great Britain, and Western Europe.
[02:20:05.527 --> 02:20:14.291]  You need to know, as a specific individual citizen of the United States of America, why these things are happening and what you can do about it.

[02:21:33.076 --> 02:21:34.097]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[02:21:34.157 --> 02:21:37.520]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:21:37.560 --> 02:21:38.801]  We're talking to Dr. Rashad.
[02:21:38.861 --> 02:21:40.322]  Zidane goes by Dr. Rashad.
[02:22:00.493 --> 02:22:03.454]  And her organization is Knowledge Society.
[02:22:03.494 --> 02:22:04.975]  She helps widows and orphans over there.
[02:22:05.015 --> 02:22:06.856]  She says more than a hundred times.
[02:22:06.896 --> 02:22:09.397]  A hundred times isn't enough to say how bad it's gotten.
[02:22:09.457 --> 02:22:10.338]  It's a hell on earth.
[02:22:10.818 --> 02:22:13.439]  Power in most cities is on just a few hours a day.
[02:22:13.459 --> 02:22:15.980]  The water treatment plants are just blown to bits.
[02:22:16.760 --> 02:22:17.421]  Dysentery.
[02:22:17.481 --> 02:22:29.086]  One of the first things the occupation extermination government did when it got in was say it's illegal to collect statistical data on cancers, on birth defects, on deaths, on everything.
[02:22:29.691 --> 02:22:30.751]  So now we don't even know.
[02:22:30.771 --> 02:22:31.872]  We just know it's far worse.
[02:22:32.492 --> 02:22:42.855]  And going back to Gail Murphy, who heads up one of these great organizations that's out there fighting all this, WomenSayNoToWar.org.
[02:22:42.875 --> 02:22:44.335]  She's the head of Code Pink as well.
[02:22:44.915 --> 02:22:47.136]  And we've got Dr. Rasheed on with us.
[02:22:48.997 --> 02:22:51.898]  Gail, you can answer this if you know, or Dr. Rasheed.
[02:22:54.295 --> 02:23:04.662]  The power being off, the infrastructure being shut down, being far worse than it was before, I think it's important to state that that's the facts, not what the neocons are saying on the radio.
[02:23:04.702 --> 02:23:05.943]  Would you guys like to comment on that?
[02:23:08.105 --> 02:23:08.265]  Yes.
[02:23:09.766 --> 02:23:12.007]  Yes, the power being off, the infrastructure.
[02:23:12.047 --> 02:23:14.009]  I mean, can you physically describe what it's like?
[02:23:15.490 --> 02:23:16.831]  What it's like?
[02:23:17.571 --> 02:23:20.193]  Firstly, you know, there's no security.
[02:23:21.294 --> 02:23:27.875]  Every day when my children go to... I have four children, two in the college, two in the... one in the secondary school, one in the primary school.
[02:23:28.275 --> 02:23:32.936]  When they go morning, they say, goodbye mother, maybe we'll meet you again.
[02:23:33.336 --> 02:23:36.257]  Because maybe they will be explosive or bombed, I don't know.
[02:23:36.757 --> 02:23:42.778]  And the small girls, when I go to the school, I bring them to the school and I'm just waiting for their returning back.
[02:23:43.138 --> 02:23:45.819]  I'm just always praying they will be safe in their school.
[02:23:46.239 --> 02:23:47.499]  So this is the security.
[02:23:48.121 --> 02:23:57.089]  And the random shooting from the American army, because you know they are afraid.
[02:23:57.489 --> 02:23:59.871]  They feel all the people in Iraq are their enemy.
[02:24:00.392 --> 02:24:03.154]  And so they shoot, just they hear.
[02:24:03.394 --> 02:24:06.437]  And the electricity is always, no electricity.
[02:24:06.457 --> 02:24:10.500]  We just got one hour in the 24 hour in the water.
[02:24:10.600 --> 02:24:13.543]  Iraqis have two big rivers of the world.
[02:24:13.959 --> 02:24:27.633]  You know, we are looking for clear water for drinking and we have pictures of how the women are trying hard holding the big jugs and go to a large distance to bring clear water for their children.
[02:24:28.454 --> 02:24:29.775]  Education, many people have...
[02:24:31.878 --> 02:24:35.702]  Let their children not go to the school because you know the security is very bad.
[02:24:35.762 --> 02:24:41.387]  Did you know the neocons said their real plan was to knock you into the Stone Age and commit genocide against you?
[02:24:41.768 --> 02:24:47.493]  And now millions of Iraqis are dead and you've gone from, what, 25 million to 23 million?
[02:24:47.513 --> 02:24:48.674]  They're killing you.
[02:24:50.055 --> 02:24:51.477]  Because we've got their plans.
[02:24:51.577 --> 02:24:55.380]  Are Iraqis aware that the official plan was to murder you?
[02:24:55.821 --> 02:24:56.842]  They never wanted to help you.
[02:24:58.639 --> 02:25:01.580]  Honestly, most Iraqi people was waiting.
[02:25:01.620 --> 02:25:02.521]  They are just waiting.
[02:25:02.541 --> 02:25:05.622]  They not give a previous judge about what is happening.
[02:25:05.662 --> 02:25:08.883]  They say, the United States say we are coming to help you.
[02:25:08.903 --> 02:25:11.384]  We are coming to freedom you from the damage.
[02:25:11.404 --> 02:25:12.625]  But you found out that's not the case.
[02:25:12.645 --> 02:25:13.265]  But we found, yes.
[02:25:13.385 --> 02:25:14.765]  This is very sad what we got.
[02:25:14.845 --> 02:25:15.766]  It is not nothing.
[02:25:16.206 --> 02:25:17.426]  We got worse and worse.
[02:25:17.646 --> 02:25:22.268]  Did you know every time a general of the provisional government says he'll get the water on, they fire him?
[02:25:22.628 --> 02:25:23.869]  The generals have complained.
[02:25:23.909 --> 02:25:25.869]  They could have gotten your power and water back on.
[02:25:26.030 --> 02:25:26.970]  They've been told not to.
[02:25:29.448 --> 02:25:33.612]  They are transferring everything by the airplane.
[02:25:33.712 --> 02:25:35.714]  The tanks, the hammers, the weapons.
[02:25:35.754 --> 02:25:39.577]  That's because Halliburton makes more money if they're able to do that, yeah.
[02:25:39.637 --> 02:25:42.980]  Can they bring us a generator and repair the electricity?
[02:25:44.021 --> 02:25:45.002]  It is so simple.
[02:25:45.022 --> 02:25:49.686]  If they can't transfer all these things, all 300,000 people, they brought them to Iraq.
[02:25:49.726 --> 02:25:54.630]  Can they bring the generator to Iraq to help them in repairing the electricity?
[02:25:56.620 --> 02:25:57.781]  If they want, they can.
[02:25:58.041 --> 02:25:59.482]  We are sure if they want, they can.
[02:25:59.762 --> 02:26:06.848]  But all of you heard about the millions of dollars, the billions of dollars which has been gone, and they say for the rebuilding of Iraq, we got nothing of it.
[02:26:07.560 --> 02:26:08.541]  Well, just a contract.
[02:26:08.601 --> 02:26:09.842]  Well, they're so greedy.
[02:26:09.862 --> 02:26:12.543]  Yeah, the contractors have to keep it all to themselves.
[02:26:12.563 --> 02:26:14.585]  I've had former contractors on.
[02:26:14.605 --> 02:26:16.606]  I've had military, Marine Corps captains on.
[02:26:16.646 --> 02:26:23.291]  They say, oh, yeah, they'll put up a blue tent and say it's a $10 million structure and then just keep the money.
[02:26:23.351 --> 02:26:25.933]  I mean, it's just bid rigging, war profiteering.
[02:26:26.333 --> 02:26:27.674]  Yes, yes.
[02:26:27.774 --> 02:26:33.498]  And all the time they are speaking, we are rebuilding Iraq, we are helping the Iraqi people, but I just,
[02:26:34.134 --> 02:26:44.926]  I want to inform you that all the people whom you heard or they maybe met in the media, they are from the side of the government and so they say everything is okay and we are living in a pink life.
[02:26:45.006 --> 02:26:52.815]  But I came from the majority of Iraqi people, the simple people who had no way to reach the media, who had no way to
[02:26:53.215 --> 02:26:55.757]  And the troops are there going, why aren't we helping these people?
[02:26:55.777 --> 02:27:01.261]  This doesn't make any sense because the plan is to stay there for decades and use it as a black hole to put weapons contracts and provisional government contracts into.
[02:27:01.281 --> 02:27:02.242]  The elections were staged.
[02:27:02.262 --> 02:27:02.942]  It's all staged.
[02:27:23.097 --> 02:27:25.620]  You know, they told us that all their media was free over there.
[02:27:25.680 --> 02:27:27.461]  It turned out it was all CIA run.
[02:27:27.982 --> 02:27:30.505]  Anybody who writes a real story gets 30 years in prison.
[02:27:31.045 --> 02:27:32.747]  One more segment with our guests when we get back.
[02:27:35.610 --> 02:27:36.511]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.011 --> 02:27:38.613]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.534 --> 02:27:42.217]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:45.723 --> 02:27:46.323]  We're good to go.

[02:28:45.740 --> 02:28:47.361]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:28:47.501 --> 02:28:51.622]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[02:28:51.742 --> 02:28:54.623]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[02:28:54.683 --> 02:29:01.385]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[02:29:01.585 --> 02:29:04.589]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[02:29:04.809 --> 02:29:07.172]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[02:29:07.332 --> 02:29:17.525]  Like murky elements, not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as aptazine, benzene, chloride, and chloroforms.
[02:29:17.765 --> 02:29:18.426]  That's 888-803-4438.

[02:30:50.732 --> 02:30:54.554]  We'll get some other news coming up here after our guests leave us here in a few minutes.
[02:30:54.574 --> 02:30:55.835]  It's been an honor to be joined by them.
[02:30:55.855 --> 02:31:05.180]  I'm glad these women have made this trek here to the United States to make some of these sick neocon followers face what they've done and they'll even pay attention.
[02:31:05.520 --> 02:31:06.541]  That's the sick thing, you know.
[02:31:07.515 --> 02:31:08.476]  I'm a real conservative.
[02:31:08.496 --> 02:31:10.437]  I mean, I disagree with Kofi on a lot of issues.
[02:31:10.477 --> 02:31:11.738]  They're probably anti-gun.
[02:31:11.798 --> 02:31:12.699]  I'm pro-Second Amendment.
[02:31:13.520 --> 02:31:14.941]  But I'm against this war.
[02:31:15.101 --> 02:31:17.042]  But the neocons, Bush is anti-gun.
[02:31:17.062 --> 02:31:18.063]  They'll go, no, he ain't.
[02:31:18.123 --> 02:31:18.784]  No, he isn't.
[02:31:19.444 --> 02:31:23.227]  Even when Bob Barr, who's an NRA board member, comes on and tells you Bush is.
[02:31:24.347 --> 02:31:26.408]  That's the delusional nature of this.
[02:31:26.889 --> 02:31:33.733]  And I go back to the fact that they claim, look at their free media, look at their free news over there, look at all these newspapers, they love Bush.
[02:31:34.233 --> 02:31:47.701]  Turned out every one of them was fake, run by the Defense Department or the CIA, written in Washington or Maryland or New York, and that anybody who writes anything that isn't pro-New World Order, pro-invasion, is instantly...
[02:31:48.771 --> 02:31:52.599]  Instantly arrested and they're given 30-year sentences.
[02:31:52.620 --> 02:31:54.504]  I'm not sure who of the two we have here.
[02:31:54.524 --> 02:31:58.333]  Is it Gail Murphy or is it Dr. Rashad Rashid?
[02:31:58.886 --> 02:31:59.966]  Let's have our ear to the phone.
[02:32:01.647 --> 02:32:14.692]  The staged elections, Gail, the fake newspapers, all of this has now come out, just like the fake WMDs, just like the Downing Street memo, the White House memo is even worse.
[02:32:15.072 --> 02:32:17.133]  I mean, now what more do we need to see?
[02:32:17.193 --> 02:32:20.374]  I mean, if my neighbor lies to me five times, I never believe him.
[02:32:20.594 --> 02:32:26.256]  Well, we've been lied to 500 times by these people premeditatively, and we're supposed to just buy their next lie?
[02:32:27.159 --> 02:32:46.026]  Well, I think that the big problem is, you know, a lot of people now know that it was all lies and that there was a, you know, premeditated justification for this war, but what we need to do is to convince people that, yes, it's a mess, but we are the problem, not the solution, and that we just have to admit our mistake.
[02:32:46.610 --> 02:32:48.773]  And figure out how to get our troops out of there.
[02:32:48.793 --> 02:32:57.204]  Well, I mean, the CIA's own real investigations and real policy reports on this say that pulling out would reduce things massively.
[02:32:58.266 --> 02:33:02.832]  And I think that that's what we have to do, is put pressure on our elected officials to take a look at that reality.
[02:33:03.191 --> 02:33:06.032]  That pulling out will reduce the violence.
[02:33:06.092 --> 02:33:08.873]  Yeah, well, you know, it's a bad war, but we're there now.
[02:33:08.933 --> 02:33:11.094]  We can't turn tail and run.
[02:33:11.114 --> 02:33:16.076]  You know, that's like if I've got my hand stuck in the garbage disposal and it's cutting my fingers off.
[02:33:16.156 --> 02:33:16.616]  I don't know.
[02:33:16.696 --> 02:33:17.517]  I'm manly.
[02:33:17.777 --> 02:33:19.717]  I'm going to saw it off to the nub.
[02:33:19.777 --> 02:33:21.978]  No, I jerk my hand out of there, Gail.
[02:33:22.018 --> 02:33:23.879]  Yeah, and that's what we have to do.
[02:33:23.899 --> 02:33:31.242]  We have to put pressure on our elected officials to look at the truth, to look at the alternatives, and to look seriously at pulling our troops out as soon as possible.
[02:33:31.442 --> 02:33:33.144]  You know who Ray McGovern is, don't you?
[02:33:33.164 --> 02:33:33.324]  Yep.
[02:33:48.238 --> 02:33:53.203]  We had him on, and he said the number one suspect in that mosque bombing is our government or the Mossad.
[02:33:53.684 --> 02:33:58.809]  I mean, clearly, a lot of these bombings are meant to stir up both sides to kill each other.
[02:33:58.969 --> 02:34:10.460]  Well, Dr. Rashad herself described, she said there was a curfew in Samarra at the time, and she asks the question, how could people get through police forces, get through National Guard, get through U.S.,
[02:34:10.854 --> 02:34:17.217]  With a substantial amount of explosives, spent eight to ten hours setting themselves up and get away with it.
[02:34:17.357 --> 02:34:18.278]  Well, that's the thing.
[02:34:18.638 --> 02:34:25.222]  In fact, reporters and people who were there and caught some of this said they were wearing Iraqi National Guard uniforms.
[02:34:25.622 --> 02:34:28.103]  In fact, let me get a comment from Dr. Rashad on that.
[02:34:28.884 --> 02:34:36.928]  The shrine bombing, that certainly got everybody at each other's throats, and the evidence clearly shows that Western intelligence did that, Doctor.
[02:34:39.125 --> 02:34:46.509]  Can you comment on the shrine bombing and coalition involvement in that?
[02:34:47.190 --> 02:34:48.971]  The bombing of the Golden Mosque.
[02:34:49.151 --> 02:34:49.351]  Yes.
[02:34:52.252 --> 02:35:00.557]  The bombing of it, you know, all the city of Iraq is completely closed after 6 o'clock evening.
[02:35:01.077 --> 02:35:04.539]  And it is well served by the American army.
[02:35:04.919 --> 02:35:06.240]  Nobody come, nobody out.
[02:35:06.936 --> 02:35:09.917]  Until the 6 o'clock early morning.
[02:35:10.297 --> 02:35:21.080]  So, what happened is that after 6 o'clock evening, as they say, that somebody came to the Golden Mosque and they bombed it.
[02:35:21.100 --> 02:35:31.783]  You know, how they come and after our Ministry for Building, he go and visit, he say, it need a large quantity of explosive materials and...
[02:35:37.000 --> 02:35:39.181]  Well, we had a little problem there.
[02:35:39.201 --> 02:35:43.364]  Might have been their phone, might have been our friends in the government.
[02:35:45.745 --> 02:35:46.966]  Do we have our guest back?
[02:35:49.608 --> 02:35:49.928]  Okay.
[02:35:50.788 --> 02:35:51.028]  Great.
[02:35:51.048 --> 02:35:59.653]  We're going to get our guest back on the good old line, whatever just happened there.
[02:35:59.714 --> 02:36:03.676]  Spend a few more minutes with them, then we'll go back to your calls.
[02:36:04.887 --> 02:36:14.269]  But yeah, I mean, understand, there where this mosque got bombed, at every street corner there are machine gun nests, armored machine gun nests, armored Humvees, barbed wire.
[02:36:14.849 --> 02:36:15.810]  You don't go anywhere.
[02:36:15.850 --> 02:36:18.250]  They live in a total police state with ID cards.
[02:36:18.870 --> 02:36:26.432]  But dozens and dozens, it was over 20 men in military, U.S.-issued military uniforms, go running in there.
[02:36:27.365 --> 02:36:32.311]  And they plant these explosives just right to blow the entire top of the dome out, right there inside of it.
[02:36:32.851 --> 02:36:42.883]  And they blow it up, and oh, it was the evil Shiites blowing up the Sunnis, or it's the Shiites blowing up the...
[02:36:43.621 --> 02:36:44.602]  He goes on and on.
[02:36:44.642 --> 02:36:46.504]  They do this and then everybody gets at each other's throats.
[02:36:46.524 --> 02:36:49.886]  I mean, there are real bombings and killings going on that aren't run by the globalists.
[02:36:49.906 --> 02:36:57.653]  But the key triggering events, you see, to get the revenge killings going, to get it going, the snowball events, that's caused another way.
[02:36:57.953 --> 02:37:00.736]  Were you able to get my guest back on?
[02:37:00.776 --> 02:37:03.618]  We had an interesting phone line problem there.
[02:37:05.809 --> 02:37:09.011]  Dr. Rashid, you were trying to finish up what you were saying there about the mosque?
[02:37:09.351 --> 02:37:16.314]  Yes, I was saying it was well-guarded by the American... All the city was well-guarded by the American army.
[02:37:16.995 --> 02:37:20.997]  After 6 o'clock, all the ways are closed and the American army are spread all over the city.
[02:37:21.317 --> 02:37:22.578]  Then who entered the city?
[02:37:22.638 --> 02:37:26.439]  Who brought this huge quantity of explosive material?
[02:37:26.760 --> 02:37:30.441]  Who stayed for arranging for this bombing for 8 to 10 hours?
[02:37:32.920 --> 02:37:43.816]  I think there is some relation and all the people who are looking for truth have to look after this and know who is pushing towards the civil war in Iraq.
[02:37:44.352 --> 02:37:47.595]  Some fingers are pushing towards it, not the Iraqi people.
[02:37:47.635 --> 02:37:48.696]  Well, this is the good news.
[02:37:48.716 --> 02:37:55.901]  I would talk to liberals, progressives in this country two years ago and say that our government was behind the bombings, and they've caught MI6 in the act doing it.
[02:37:55.921 --> 02:37:57.122]  They've caught Israelis doing it.
[02:37:57.162 --> 02:38:00.185]  Marines have caught them and beat them up now in their order to release them.
[02:38:01.186 --> 02:38:02.827]  So this has been going on now.
[02:38:03.227 --> 02:38:09.352]  Now I talk to people, not just Iraqis like yourself, but I talk to Americans, and they're like, oh, yes, of course, it's the government.
[02:38:09.793 --> 02:38:13.636]  So, I mean, it seems like there is an awakening to who's behind it now, Doctor.
[02:38:14.577 --> 02:38:17.802]  Yes, any people do not want Iraq to be settled down.
[02:38:17.902 --> 02:38:27.315]  All people who want to stay their armies in Iraq for a longer time, saying we have a reason for staying our army.
[02:38:27.355 --> 02:38:29.018]  There is a civil war will happen in Iraq.
[02:38:29.369 --> 02:38:30.129]  Well, it's like Katrina.
[02:38:30.149 --> 02:38:34.012]  By sabotaging Katrina and making it as bad as they could, which is now admitted.
[02:38:34.052 --> 02:38:36.373]  We have police on record saying the feds were sabotaging.
[02:38:47.515 --> 02:38:49.416]  Then they get to put more money into it.
[02:38:49.456 --> 02:38:49.936]  It's worse.
[02:38:50.016 --> 02:38:51.417]  It gets more federal control.
[02:38:51.737 --> 02:38:54.918]  Bush gets in trouble on the surface, but his cronies get billions more.
[02:38:55.318 --> 02:38:56.359]  Same thing in Iraq.
[02:38:56.699 --> 02:39:01.061]  If they would have fixed things in six months, these corporations wouldn't make hundreds of billions of dollars.
[02:39:01.321 --> 02:39:01.501]  Yes.
[02:39:02.382 --> 02:39:03.522]  Gail, do you agree with that statement?
[02:39:03.942 --> 02:39:04.402]  Yes, yes.
[02:39:05.743 --> 02:39:08.564]  You know, not just only the money, the people.
[02:39:09.125 --> 02:39:14.207]  We are, somebody are being killed from Iraqi people and from the American soldiers.
[02:39:14.307 --> 02:39:16.948]  So let's start to stop the suffering for the Bush
[02:39:17.328 --> 02:39:19.070]  You have to start from now.
[02:39:19.150 --> 02:39:23.334]  You are not saying I'm just waiting in order civil war won't happen.
[02:39:23.755 --> 02:39:32.263]  Now the American army in Iraq and you hear every day and you maybe see on the TV what is happening in Iraq from bombing and suppressing and killing people.
[02:39:32.503 --> 02:39:33.864]  Then what this army is doing?
[02:39:35.046 --> 02:39:35.386]  Nothing.
[02:39:35.506 --> 02:39:36.347]  They are doing nothing.
[02:39:38.197 --> 02:39:42.320]  They sit there in armored fortresses while their black ops squads go around carrying out attacks.
[02:39:43.381 --> 02:39:49.086]  Thank you so much, Doctor, for joining us, and I wish you Godspeed, and I hope you do well around the country.
[02:39:49.106 --> 02:39:51.928]  I hope people come out and see you and other ladies that are here doing this.
[02:39:53.069 --> 02:39:53.910]  Thank you for joining us.
[02:39:53.950 --> 02:39:56.012]  Can I say some parting things to Gail Murphy, please?
[02:39:57.553 --> 02:40:01.356]  Well, Gail, tell us about a few of the events that are coming up and how people get involved in this.
[02:40:02.657 --> 02:40:05.419]  Well, as you mentioned, womensaynotowar.org.
[02:40:07.115 --> 02:40:09.796]  Has a link to their schedule.
[02:40:10.257 --> 02:40:10.837]  There are women.
[02:40:10.937 --> 02:40:15.999]  There's Faiza Al-Araji, who's in Southern California, heading up towards San Francisco.
[02:40:16.120 --> 02:40:21.342]  Dr. Rashad will be taking off for North Carolina, Illinois, back to New York, Washington.
[02:40:22.282 --> 02:40:26.465]  Iman Hamas is in Connecticut now, but then will be heading to Seattle.
[02:40:26.705 --> 02:40:30.566]  And she's got a whole list of bookings through the middle of April.
[02:40:32.096 --> 02:40:35.982]  So womensaynotaward.org will be updating their schedule.
[02:40:36.062 --> 02:40:43.773]  You can get a hold of June at globalexchange.org if you're interested in inviting these women close to your community.
[02:40:44.235 --> 02:40:45.296]  I know you're in the Austin area.
[02:40:45.316 --> 02:40:47.477]  Yeah, we need to get you guys down here and down to Crawford.
[02:40:48.518 --> 02:40:49.939]  Oh, there's plans for that, I think.
[02:40:50.279 --> 02:40:51.740]  Cindy will be coming to Washington.
[02:40:51.840 --> 02:40:53.261]  That would be beautiful.
[02:40:53.361 --> 02:41:01.306]  Maybe do it when the criminal's out there at his cowboy stage where he poses as a cowboy and maybe get you guys out there to confront him right there.
[02:41:01.326 --> 02:41:01.787]  All right.
[02:41:01.987 --> 02:41:10.752]  Well, we're also planning a Mother's Day vigil in front of the White House and we are still looking to have the two mothers who were denied visas to come to the U.S.
[02:41:10.852 --> 02:41:13.094]  and hopefully other Iraqi mothers who can come
[02:41:13.587 --> 02:41:17.349]  And they can talk about, this is the face of war, this is what you're doing.
[02:41:17.389 --> 02:41:37.820]  Well, in closing, you both said this, many others have said this, Paul Craig Roberts said this last hour, Dr. Roberts, again, a huge Republican, domestically, we're going into a dictatorship, America's a police state, they're setting up a police state here, destroying our 230 years of freedom, while claiming we're bringing them freedom over there, when it's the complete opposite.
[02:41:38.380 --> 02:41:41.001]  And this is all being done in the American people's name.
[02:41:41.041 --> 02:41:41.421]  That's right.
[02:41:41.461 --> 02:41:44.242]  We have to stand up and say, no, this is not in our name.
[02:41:44.602 --> 02:41:46.423]  And we have to be creative about how we do that.
[02:41:46.503 --> 02:41:50.064]  You know, voting and writing letters and op-eds is not enough.
[02:41:50.484 --> 02:41:52.125]  We really need to be unified.
[02:41:52.165 --> 02:41:56.567]  We need to be aggressive in our resistance, and we need to be relentless.
[02:41:57.467 --> 02:41:58.407]  Well, I agree with you.
[02:41:58.607 --> 02:42:00.848]  And Gail Murphy, thank you so much for joining us.
[02:42:01.028 --> 02:42:01.929]  Thank you for having us.
[02:42:02.129 --> 02:42:02.409]  You bet.
[02:42:02.449 --> 02:42:02.789]  Take care.
[02:42:04.187 --> 02:42:06.808]  Let's take a few calls, and I'll hit a few final news articles.
[02:42:06.848 --> 02:42:11.690]  There's so much we didn't cover today at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, and so much we didn't cover yesterday.
[02:42:11.730 --> 02:42:14.411]  We cover more than any other show out there, but it's just too much.
[02:42:14.811 --> 02:42:19.153]  The crimes are getting so ridiculous that I fear for this country.
[02:42:19.193 --> 02:42:20.413]  I fear for all of our futures.
[02:42:20.473 --> 02:42:26.156]  I mean, we've got psychopathic nuts running things, and it's just they're pulling out all the stops.
[02:42:26.196 --> 02:42:28.797]  They're reckless, like Dr. Roberts said last hour.
[02:42:30.177 --> 02:42:32.038]  Let's talk to Dr. Bill Deagle.
[02:42:32.831 --> 02:42:35.673]  Dr. Deagle, thank you so much for joining us here today.
[02:42:36.213 --> 02:42:36.773]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:42:36.853 --> 02:42:37.954]  As always, you're the best.
[02:42:38.214 --> 02:42:39.735]  I mean, I'm amazed at the show.
[02:42:40.555 --> 02:42:49.700]  My mother's family are from Lebanon, Lebanese Christians, and I can tell you, everything this doctor is saying is true, and it just brings tears to my eyes at what's going on over there.
[02:42:50.900 --> 02:43:02.306]  All the people lived, Jews, Christians, Muslims, all lived and are in peace until the British got oil there 150 years ago, then they armed the Druze militia as long as 100 and some years ago,
[02:43:02.881 --> 02:43:08.288]  My great-grandmother came in 1898 into America.
[02:43:09.429 --> 02:43:11.632]  What I see going on is just an abomination.
[02:43:11.752 --> 02:43:19.422]  And what they're going to do is try to turn all of Islam, more than a billion people, into a meat grinder for American young men and women to die
[02:43:20.354 --> 02:43:24.476]  I've said this over and over again.
[02:43:24.516 --> 02:43:27.638]  This ought to be the headline on a story we ought to write.
[02:43:28.098 --> 02:43:29.479]  America is the target.
[02:43:30.079 --> 02:43:31.540]  Iraq is only the pretext.
[02:43:31.560 --> 02:43:35.082]  We need to explain, and Bush told his biographer this, we're the real target.
[02:43:35.863 --> 02:43:40.045]  I hate to use a child's analogy, but Revenge of the Sith.
[02:43:40.618 --> 02:43:41.798]  He's a little-known senator.
[02:43:42.199 --> 02:43:54.942]  He hires people to covertly attack his own planet, says the Senate won't do enough, gets elected chancellor, then attacks his own planets again and again to become emperor, and then knocks out his own forces.
[02:43:55.383 --> 02:43:57.183]  This is actually what governments do.
[02:43:57.203 --> 02:44:01.705]  You know, children can understand the plot, but adults can't understand it in the real world.
[02:44:01.725 --> 02:44:08.967]  I have a friend who's a medic, and he came back, and this is a fellow from Vietnam, and he came back, and we sat down for lunch a year ago,
[02:44:10.057 --> 02:44:10.938]  And he cried.
[02:44:11.879 --> 02:44:12.980]  He told me things.
[02:44:13.000 --> 02:44:13.780]  He started blubbering.
[02:44:13.800 --> 02:44:19.225]  He couldn't even finish what he did when he was over in Iraq trying to take care of our troops and what was happening to the... Who was this?
[02:44:19.325 --> 02:44:19.746]  A medic?
[02:44:20.206 --> 02:44:20.466]  Yes.
[02:44:20.626 --> 02:44:21.527]  He was a senior medic.
[02:44:21.567 --> 02:44:27.392]  Actually, he was a battalion medic commander in the reserve forces from Fort Buckley.
[02:44:28.333 --> 02:44:30.335]  And it was unbelievable what was going on over there.
[02:44:30.535 --> 02:44:37.261]  And what's happening is a thousand times worse in many ways than what happened in the first Gulf War and the aftermath because...
[02:44:37.799 --> 02:44:39.741]  Now everything is gone, and there's no rebuilding.
[02:44:40.062 --> 02:44:41.884]  There's nothing happening over there at all.
[02:44:42.284 --> 02:44:45.088]  And they want to do this to Iran, but they're going to get an awful surprise.
[02:44:45.769 --> 02:44:48.111]  And that's why the advance warning has been out there.
[02:44:48.552 --> 02:44:54.459]  I'm certain that the Iranians have got some horrific surprises for our surface navy, for our armed forces.
[02:44:55.194 --> 02:44:59.097]  And Russia and China are not playing the game all according to the rules.
[02:44:59.177 --> 02:45:08.303]  And the globalists know that if they can get us engaged in this fight, when we're getting our tails kicked at first, a lot of Americans who are even against the war will say, we've got to get in there now.
[02:45:08.504 --> 02:45:09.544]  We can't lose.
[02:45:10.085 --> 02:45:13.907]  Hey, who's bad, the bear trap or the person that sticks your arm in it?
[02:45:14.228 --> 02:45:14.448]  Right.
[02:45:14.488 --> 02:45:19.411]  We're going to have every man, woman under age 40 die in this war.
[02:45:19.672 --> 02:45:23.114]  If this continues, it will be country after country until there's not a man or woman left.
[02:45:23.490 --> 02:45:24.992]  Under age 40 that's still alive.
[02:45:26.473 --> 02:45:27.154]  That's what they're going to do.
[02:45:27.174 --> 02:45:29.156]  They want to rip and tear our country to pieces.
[02:45:29.637 --> 02:45:36.804]  And once they get rid of America, which I consider the only republic that's standing against the New World Order, and once they rip America down, they'll nuke it.
[02:45:36.864 --> 02:45:38.006]  And they've already got plans.
[02:45:38.026 --> 02:45:41.009]  I have contacts that know about all the displaced nukes.
[02:45:41.570 --> 02:45:44.271]  About short-range nuclear missiles in Central and South America.
[02:45:44.291 --> 02:45:50.213]  By the way, I have a big article today about masses of Chinese troops moving into Latin America.
[02:45:50.233 --> 02:45:51.273]  Thanks for the call.
[02:45:51.293 --> 02:45:53.193]  That's one of the ones I want to hit after I take a final call.
[02:45:53.614 --> 02:45:54.654]  Joe in California.
[02:45:54.694 --> 02:45:55.474]  Joe, you're on the air.
[02:45:55.514 --> 02:45:55.914]  Go ahead.
[02:45:55.954 --> 02:45:56.754]  Get over here for me, Dr. Deagle.
[02:45:57.615 --> 02:45:58.575]  Yeah.
[02:46:00.035 --> 02:46:00.596]  Is he still online?
[02:46:00.616 --> 02:46:01.296]  No, he's gone.
[02:46:01.316 --> 02:46:02.636]  I was saying bye to him.
[02:46:02.676 --> 02:46:03.316]  Go ahead, Joe.
[02:46:03.636 --> 02:46:05.557]  Okay, well, I wanted you just to know that
[02:46:06.001 --> 02:46:13.585]  Have you heard the report that our troops are being denied the use of their body armor, that their families are buying them?
[02:46:13.945 --> 02:46:15.446]  Yes.
[02:46:15.466 --> 02:46:25.812]  They're telling them that if they, the commanders are telling them that if they use the body armor their families send them, that they won't get combat death pay.
[02:46:26.735 --> 02:46:27.335]  Have you heard that?
[02:46:27.635 --> 02:46:34.557]  Yes, and that's because they're afraid that the companies that they're bed-rigging with won't make as much money.
[02:46:34.697 --> 02:46:41.899]  It's defective level 2 body armor that's now admitted, so families are shipping them level 3, and they're getting penalized for wearing it.
[02:46:42.199 --> 02:46:42.439]  Yeah.
[02:46:43.120 --> 02:46:46.460]  Sir, they make them pay for their own meals when their arms and legs are blown off, okay?
[02:46:46.721 --> 02:46:47.101]  Yeah.
[02:46:47.561 --> 02:46:50.142]  That's how the scumbag neocons support the troops.
[02:46:50.782 --> 02:46:52.602]  Do you have a website for this guy, Deagle?

[02:46:56.691 --> 02:46:58.192]  Thanks for the call, Joe.
[02:46:58.232 --> 02:47:00.013]  I appreciate it.
[02:47:00.933 --> 02:47:02.474]  Look at this article.
[02:47:03.494 --> 02:47:05.835]  New panel to investigate Iraq war policy.
[02:47:05.875 --> 02:47:18.920]  Ten prominent Americans, including former Secretary of State James A. Baker, are forming a bipartisan group to assess the Bush administration's policies in Iraq and political and economic developments, including Lee Hamilton, involved in the 9-11 First Commission.
[02:47:19.380 --> 02:47:20.980]  And then they call it independent in here.
[02:47:23.143 --> 02:47:25.745]  It's just such a... They'll look at the war.
[02:47:25.785 --> 02:47:27.005]  They'll come up with a plan.
[02:47:27.846 --> 02:47:29.567]  And the public doesn't know who James Baker III is.
[02:47:29.587 --> 02:47:31.308]  They don't know he was Secretary of State.
[02:47:34.510 --> 02:47:35.350]  They don't know anything.

[02:47:54.525 --> 02:47:57.367]  And it makes identity become completely lost.
[02:47:57.447 --> 02:48:01.749]  It's the opposite of security, so it's billed as security.
[02:48:03.210 --> 02:48:09.834]  And the paper to be presented today at the Economic Academic Computer Conference in Pisa, Italy...
[02:48:10.968 --> 02:48:18.676]  The researchers plan to demonstrate how it is possible to infect a tiny portion of memory in the chit which can hold as little as 128 characters of information.
[02:48:19.216 --> 02:48:19.797]  It goes on.
[02:48:22.800 --> 02:48:23.380]  But don't worry.
[02:48:23.801 --> 02:48:25.883]  Reich's terrorists are all about to kill us.
[02:48:26.704 --> 02:48:27.084]  Here's one.

[02:52:32.355 --> 02:52:33.915]  connection, 9-11 attacks.
[02:52:34.736 --> 02:52:40.438]  And it says the judge is considering whether to rule the possibility out of execution because of egregious government conduct.
[02:52:40.818 --> 02:52:46.760]  Government said one of its lawyers had coached four witnesses breaking rules set by the judge and done a bunch of other stuff.
[02:52:48.126 --> 02:52:55.573]  And then there's an article by Bill Gertz that the Communist Chinese are massing troops down in Latin America, but it's all because there's laws against U.S.
[02:52:55.613 --> 02:52:56.654]  troops in Latin America.

[02:53:01.919 --> 02:53:03.360]  Our government's sold out to China.
[02:53:04.221 --> 02:53:07.304]  So that's the real news there.

[02:53:17.043 --> 02:53:21.407]  They'll be playing at Red Rum around midnight, I guess, sometime this evening.
