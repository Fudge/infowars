[00:00:05.563 --> 00:00:06.203]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.884 --> 00:00:07.924]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.644 --> 00:00:09.804]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.425 --> 00:00:11.245]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.965 --> 00:00:12.945]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.545 --> 00:00:17.226]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.727 --> 00:00:21.808]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:40.005]  There have been literally hundreds of fake terror alerts, and in every case, it has come out, even in the mainstream news, that they were staged.
[00:00:40.906 --> 00:00:54.434]  White House Press Secretary, weeks before he resigned, Ari Fleischer, admitted to the press corps, we found the transcript of that and have reposted it, admitted that they issued fake terror alerts for political reasons.
[00:00:55.554 --> 00:00:58.156]  I have CBS News with a report admitting it.
[00:00:58.236 --> 00:00:59.657]  I have the Washington Times.
[00:01:00.484 --> 00:01:08.707]  And I have detailed reports from Europe documenting this, as well as articles we've done at prisonplanet.com and infowars.com.
[00:01:09.347 --> 00:01:22.752]  What you're witnessing right now, though, with the supposed replay of the Operation Bojinka, I believe is a major indicator that the balloon may be going up.
[00:01:22.872 --> 00:01:26.613]  We are about to see the beginning of World War III.
[00:01:26.793 --> 00:01:27.794]  I believe we have a 90...
[00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:30.210]  Percent chance.
[00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.332]  In fact, I think it's higher than 90%.
[00:01:32.773 --> 00:01:41.582]  I would say probably 95% chance right now that we are going to see World War III in the next two months.
[00:01:41.662 --> 00:01:49.470]  The confluence of data, the information, I have analyzed it, I have looked at it, and barring a heroic effort,
[00:01:50.373 --> 00:02:07.337]  By the American people to go absolutely ape on the Internet and calling into radio talk shows and C-SPAN and the Congress, minus that, and probably regardless, we are going to see the massive attack on Iran, a huge escalation in Lebanon.
[00:02:07.477 --> 00:02:13.958]  Of course, that will all follow huge terrorist attacks in the United States.
[00:02:14.967 --> 00:02:21.011]  I have not been so sure of anything since I went on air two months before 9-11 and told you to call the White House.
[00:02:21.411 --> 00:02:23.932]  Tell them do not attack the World Trade Center.
[00:02:24.393 --> 00:02:30.496]  Do not blame it on your CIA asset, Osama bin Laden.
[00:02:30.536 --> 00:02:33.358]  Well, I'm here to tell you that I have looked at the denim.
[00:02:34.222 --> 00:02:35.203]  We're good to go.
[00:02:35.223 --> 00:02:35.403]  I think?
[00:02:50.614 --> 00:02:53.115]  World War III.
[00:02:53.135 --> 00:03:00.817]  90% chance right now that we're going to see this by October and maybe even sooner.
[00:03:01.118 --> 00:03:07.920]  We are going into this thing right now, 110% at Mach 20 here, ladies and gentlemen, with our hair on fire, the criminals.
[00:03:12.441 --> 00:03:13.022]  We're good to go.
[00:03:36.119 --> 00:03:38.640]  Call into the radio talk shows.
[00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:43.641]  Tell everyone to tune into this radio broadcast in the next three hours.
[00:03:43.721 --> 00:03:51.103]  Now, I've got Mike Malloy, who's got one of the better programs, one of the more hard-hitting programs on Air America scheduled in the second hour.
[00:03:51.123 --> 00:03:56.225]  And we'll obviously be talking about the latest fake terror alerts, the latest fake terror busts.
[00:03:57.032 --> 00:04:00.193]  If you didn't know, they have gone to level red here in the U.S.
[00:04:00.513 --> 00:04:01.314]  the first time.
[00:04:01.694 --> 00:04:08.756]  We have public announcements by the White House that red means martial law, though they're doing this in limited jurisdictions right now.
[00:04:08.776 --> 00:04:14.118]  And we have this on the back of 100 other pieces of data times 100.
[00:04:14.658 --> 00:04:19.760]  I will try to calmly walk through it on the other side of the break.
[00:04:21.315 --> 00:04:23.838]  I have been hoping above hope we wouldn't have World War III.
[00:04:24.458 --> 00:04:28.623]  I have been trying my hardest to warn people and to get you moving against them.
[00:04:29.584 --> 00:04:38.072]  As we see this enemy rising, as we see this historical shift happening, we have seen a great reaction of the people against it.
[00:04:38.112 --> 00:04:39.734]  That's why we've been winning on many fronts.
[00:04:40.642 --> 00:04:48.405]  But the enemies of humanity have the capacity to launch and to escalate huge conflicts and to carry out terror attacks they stage.
[00:04:48.826 --> 00:04:54.168]  And so we're entering the darkest waters that the Western world has ever seen.
[00:04:54.728 --> 00:05:01.071]  We'll be right back on the other side of this quick break as this wartime broadcast, The Battle for the Republic, continues!
[00:05:04.332 --> 00:05:07.513]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[00:05:07.873 --> 00:05:09.813]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[00:05:10.173 --> 00:05:17.835]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:05:18.515 --> 00:05:25.556]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:05:25.957 --> 00:05:28.897]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran.
[00:05:29.237 --> 00:05:31.598]  The White House probed to disseminate fake news.
[00:05:32.018 --> 00:05:32.858]  NSA spies.
[00:05:34.268 --> 00:05:37.389]  The latest 9-11 information and much, much more.
[00:05:37.689 --> 00:05:41.170]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:43.571]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:05:43.911 --> 00:05:47.832]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:06:00.874 --> 00:06:01.595]  Hello, folks.
[00:06:01.615 --> 00:06:08.460]  This is Alex Jones introducing you to the incredible Berkey Solar Charger, your source for free solar electricity.
[00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:15.826]  This portable system is the size of a book when folded and small enough to fit into a briefcase, handbag, or glove compartment.
[00:06:15.946 --> 00:06:27.495]  The Berkey Solar Charger has been designed to power the Berkey lights, LED lamps, as well as other applications such as mobile phones, radios, digital cameras, and PDAs when electricity is unavailable.
[00:06:27.876 --> 00:06:29.377]  Its multi-voltage capability
[00:06:29.377 --> 00:06:34.521]  Get the incredible Berkey Solar Charger for only $75 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:06:34.541 --> 00:06:35.802]  That's toll-free, triple
[00:06:57.637 --> 00:06:57.677]  888-803-4438
[00:07:15.411 --> 00:07:24.313]  Grown by Nature products are different because they use renatured ingredients, proprietary blends of essential vitamins and minerals, with cofactors of proteins, lipids, and complex carbohydrates.
[00:07:24.733 --> 00:07:31.074]  Over 50 studies have been conducted on renatured nutrients, and over 20 have been published in peer-reviewed journals proclaiming their superiority.
[00:07:31.434 --> 00:07:35.955]  As a result, Grown by Nature vitamins and supplements are now recognized as simply the best available.
[00:07:36.335 --> 00:07:36.515]  Call 877-817-9829.
[00:07:36.535 --> 00:07:37.916]  That's 877-817-9829 and order your Grown by Nature products today.
[00:07:37.956 --> 00:07:38.716]  We are what we are.
[00:07:44.577 --> 00:07:46.398]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:07:46.499 --> 00:07:47.739]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:09.921 --> 00:08:13.366]  Notice that we have a chain of events taking place here.
[00:08:13.846 --> 00:08:19.634]  There's normal military incursions on both sides, skirmishing going on in Lebanon four weeks ago.
[00:08:20.435 --> 00:08:23.018]  Israel decides to go absolutely ape-invade.
[00:08:23.058 --> 00:08:25.581]  They've now massed another 40,000 troops on the border.
[00:08:27.390 --> 00:08:27.850]  We're good to go.
[00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:51.041]  We're good to go.
[00:08:51.061 --> 00:08:51.261]  I think?
[00:09:12.575 --> 00:09:22.400]  Without criminal records, with the FBI leading them and giving them $50,000 to say they were part of Al-Qaeda to create the illusion of this threat.
[00:09:22.721 --> 00:09:29.024]  We have two months ago the fake terror alert in England where they raid the house and shoot the innocent person.
[00:09:29.444 --> 00:09:31.185]  No weapons of any type were found.
[00:09:31.445 --> 00:09:36.208]  For two days they announced that they'd found chemical weapons, then later had to admit it was all totally made up.
[00:09:36.728 --> 00:09:37.669]  Same thing here.
[00:09:37.709 --> 00:09:42.132]  They claim they busted 21 people who had this new liquid explosive.
[00:09:42.452 --> 00:09:45.414]  So now in the U.S., you can't bring your drinks on board the plane.
[00:09:45.614 --> 00:09:47.936]  We've all got to learn how to be even bigger prisoners.
[00:09:48.296 --> 00:09:50.777]  In the U.K., no carry-on luggage is allowed.
[00:09:51.018 --> 00:09:56.781]  We're now on red alert here in the United States, which Homeland Security has described as martial law.
[00:09:56.821 --> 00:10:03.566]  I had the Washington Post with Homeland Security Deputy Director three years ago saying basically it is martial law.
[00:10:04.472 --> 00:10:06.033]  So, here you have it.
[00:10:06.113 --> 00:10:07.234]  Elections coming up.
[00:10:07.654 --> 00:10:10.476]  Electronic voting machine scam systems going in.
[00:10:11.117 --> 00:10:12.698]  Bush signing American Union.
[00:10:12.738 --> 00:10:15.560]  Totally butchering the country right in front of us.
[00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:22.645]  Business owners all over the country getting letters telling them to go off new American Union codes as we're merged with Mexico and Canada.
[00:10:24.066 --> 00:10:25.187]  All of this is going on.
[00:10:25.287 --> 00:10:31.351]  Mainline conservatives are in a catatonic state in a fetal position, sucking their thumbs, worshipping George Bush.
[00:10:31.631 --> 00:10:32.712]  I mean, literally, folks.
[00:10:35.518 --> 00:10:35.858]  It was July 25, 2001.
[00:11:02.950 --> 00:11:16.374]  A month and a half, two months before 9-11, that I got on air, and I said, call the White House, tell them, don't carry out the terror attacks on the World Trade Center, and I said they'd probably claim that bin Laden had done it, their asset.
[00:11:16.394 --> 00:11:19.595]  Of course, he wouldn't be able to, but he would take the blame in some respect.
[00:11:20.135 --> 00:11:22.556]  And then also said, look, we know we have your own documents.
[00:11:22.576 --> 00:11:24.796]  We know you want to hijack jets and blow them up.
[00:11:25.296 --> 00:11:25.996]  Don't try it.
[00:11:26.076 --> 00:11:30.878]  Okay, that's how I take data, collate, lay it out, and give you an analysis.
[00:11:31.118 --> 00:11:37.799]  And I can't be sure until they're sure, because I can tell when their propaganda solidifies and a preparatory phase begins.
[00:11:38.039 --> 00:11:49.362]  And I'm here to tell you, there is a 90% chance we are going to see bone-shattering mega attacks in the United States, Canada, or England.
[00:11:50.376 --> 00:11:50.916]  Or Israel.
[00:11:50.936 --> 00:11:53.277]  Could even be in Israel, but I think it's going to be... It could be both.
[00:11:55.098 --> 00:12:03.901]  In the next couple months, and it could be sooner rather than later, but by mid-October, they could be so arrogant, they could do it the day before the election.
[00:12:03.961 --> 00:12:05.621]  You never know with these people.
[00:12:05.661 --> 00:12:08.582]  That's how arrogant their hubris, their chutzpah, has gotten.
[00:12:09.863 --> 00:12:12.304]  But let me just try to... I mean, we're here talking about World War III.
[00:12:12.324 --> 00:12:18.566]  We're all running around the office and going over this, and this is exactly the things we predicted we would see.
[00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:20.801]  Let me try to lay out the analysis.
[00:12:20.901 --> 00:12:24.484]  And it's very complex, and again, I'm not good at articulating it, but let me just try.
[00:12:25.164 --> 00:12:25.745]  Let me just try.
[00:12:26.766 --> 00:12:29.148]  We're talking about the total end of America, total martial law.
[00:12:29.188 --> 00:12:29.848]  I've got to calm down.
[00:12:29.868 --> 00:12:30.148]  Hold on.
[00:12:32.991 --> 00:12:35.653]  Because we knew if we saw what's now happening, they were really going to do it.
[00:12:35.933 --> 00:12:39.896]  These murdering scum are really going to do it.
[00:12:41.097 --> 00:12:41.437]  Okay?
[00:12:41.497 --> 00:12:43.759]  Right now, they're really going to do it.
[00:12:44.543 --> 00:12:55.909]  Unless we call into every radio, every TV show, unless we go out on the streets and demonstrate, unless we really get aggressive right now to point out that we know what's happening and we understand what they're doing.
[00:12:58.350 --> 00:13:01.151]  Number one, let's talk about these busts they've been carrying out.
[00:13:01.672 --> 00:13:10.416]  I predicted three or four years ago that the prelude to a new mega attack or string of large attacks, they could do either, but I'm looking for a big mega attack here.
[00:13:12.997 --> 00:13:13.978]  Leading up to that,
[00:13:17.577 --> 00:13:19.479]  Because the government has a psychology problem.
[00:13:20.139 --> 00:13:28.046]  They know that they can pose as our tyrant, as our savior, only if the people believe that the threat is real and the government can protect them.
[00:13:30.448 --> 00:13:43.560]  And so what we're facing here is the fact that clearly, before a major attack, I predicted they would have five to ten staged busts of terrorists.
[00:13:44.910 --> 00:13:45.551]  We're good to go.
[00:14:02.769 --> 00:14:06.270]  Six years, whatever it's going to be, and we just couldn't stop them all.
[00:14:06.330 --> 00:14:22.432]  We sure tried, and there were you people out there that passed the Patriot Act overthrow in hundreds of cities in four or five states, and it was you people that protested against this, and you didn't let us have our war in the Middle East, and you didn't see the threat, and so it's all your fault, so never question us again.
[00:14:24.113 --> 00:14:27.833]  That's the post-propaganda you'll hear.
[00:14:27.853 --> 00:14:31.734]  I've heard some of their operatives, Savage and others, some of these dual citizen operatives,
[00:14:33.645 --> 00:14:38.007]  On the radio saying, you just wait till there's another attack.
[00:14:38.367 --> 00:14:43.830]  You know, you people that act for the war, you're getting arrested, and you're going to force labor camps.
[00:14:44.490 --> 00:14:54.935]  And we've had, again, Deputy Attorney General say it, and we've had it written in memos, and we had yesterday Newt Gingrich saying, all Americans that disagree with the war are an insurgency.
[00:14:56.696 --> 00:15:01.398]  No, you're the insurgency, you terrorist and terrorist supporters.
[00:15:02.583 --> 00:15:06.367]  And you're legions of fake little conservatives.
[00:15:06.567 --> 00:15:08.288]  You're such frauds.
[00:15:08.408 --> 00:15:09.149]  You people.
[00:15:09.830 --> 00:15:11.371]  You think you're part of this system.
[00:15:12.132 --> 00:15:14.734]  You think reality is what you decide it is.
[00:15:15.135 --> 00:15:17.477]  You believe that fraud, that perception is reality.
[00:15:17.837 --> 00:15:23.583]  No, you can perceive a walk in the park when you're really being dropped out of an airplane from 5,000 feet without a parachute.
[00:15:24.684 --> 00:15:25.604]  But I'm digressing.
[00:15:25.624 --> 00:15:28.267]  Let me try to put this in a nutshell.
[00:15:30.925 --> 00:15:33.126]  I'm just so upset and so angry about this right now.
[00:15:34.887 --> 00:15:38.529]  It's like watching a murder take place, knowing you could stop it if the people would just take action.
[00:15:40.750 --> 00:15:43.151]  And knowing the murderers will pose as our saviors.
[00:15:43.191 --> 00:15:44.792]  That's the sickest part.
[00:15:46.252 --> 00:15:52.095]  There's going to be all these sick neocon followers who are going to be happy when hundreds of thousands die, tens of thousands die.
[00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:56.342]  It's like a euphoria to them, like they proved something.
[00:15:56.362 --> 00:15:57.703]  They'll be strutting around.
[00:15:57.723 --> 00:16:00.525]  They'll be able to keep their guns, all the new brown shirts we're going to have.
[00:16:00.786 --> 00:16:01.806]  It's going to be dark, folks.
[00:16:01.846 --> 00:16:02.467]  It's going to be bad.
[00:16:02.487 --> 00:16:04.729]  All right, I've got to stop.
[00:16:06.390 --> 00:16:07.110]  Getting back to this.
[00:16:08.872 --> 00:16:18.839]  So we have them in the preparatory phase, clearly, for another attack with this flurry of fake bust.
[00:16:19.452 --> 00:16:27.798]  Of staged, patsy, provocateur sting setups in England and in Canada and the U.S.
[00:16:28.339 --> 00:16:29.640]  and in Europe and in the Middle East.
[00:16:29.740 --> 00:16:31.681]  Totally and completely staged.
[00:16:31.861 --> 00:16:32.202]  All of it.
[00:16:32.922 --> 00:16:39.787]  In the back of the paper it comes out the Bali bombing was intelligence and it comes out that the bombings in Iraq are SAS and it comes out.
[00:16:39.807 --> 00:16:40.468]  But it doesn't matter.
[00:16:41.268 --> 00:16:48.474]  Because again, a new poll out, 30 plus percent of Americans don't know the year 9-11 happened.
[00:16:49.252 --> 00:16:52.174]  And I guarantee you, if you question them, they're the ones that believe the government story.
[00:16:54.015 --> 00:16:56.757]  By the way, there was a majority of people above 40 that think that.
[00:16:56.997 --> 00:16:59.118]  See, they're just totally mind-numbed people.
[00:16:59.138 --> 00:17:00.919]  They don't believe anything.
[00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:02.300]  They don't know anything.
[00:17:02.641 --> 00:17:04.322]  It's all about their own self-gratification.
[00:17:04.362 --> 00:17:07.584]  Playing golf, having sex, watching porno, drinking beer.
[00:17:08.624 --> 00:17:13.968]  It's animals that just feed their primitive centers.
[00:17:14.168 --> 00:17:16.750]  You can't even communicate with 30-40% of people.
[00:17:16.790 --> 00:17:17.210]  They are gone.
[00:17:20.487 --> 00:17:20.827]  Okay.
[00:17:22.228 --> 00:17:25.230]  They're the ones that will man the death camps and think that's America and freedom.
[00:17:26.870 --> 00:17:30.252]  That the Houston Chronicle has reported on the emergency FEMA camps, by the way, for you and your family.
[00:17:30.312 --> 00:17:31.473]  So again, that's not a rumor now.
[00:17:32.914 --> 00:17:36.936]  Though we had the purchase orders and Pentagon documents ten years ago for you, now it's mainstream news.
[00:17:37.856 --> 00:17:46.461]  So we have this preparatory phase of they've got to say, oh, we busted a bunch of people and we stopped a bunch of attacks, but we can't stop them all.
[00:17:47.472 --> 00:17:52.415]  And you dirty commie rat peaceniks, why you stopped us from keeping you safe.
[00:17:52.475 --> 00:17:54.696]  And no one will point out they left the border wide open.
[00:17:55.397 --> 00:17:59.419]  And then now after the new attack, Bush will say, see, you've got to pass my amnesty plan.
[00:17:59.659 --> 00:18:00.880]  Yes, worker, it'll keep you safe.
[00:18:01.060 --> 00:18:02.901]  Won't matter if it's the total end of the U.S.
[00:18:03.201 --> 00:18:04.902]  I mean, officially, folks, into the country.
[00:18:05.643 --> 00:18:09.405]  And they'll be people with George Bush stickers, loving the American Union.
[00:18:09.525 --> 00:18:11.066]  They'll probably even wear armbands.
[00:18:11.226 --> 00:18:12.627]  Look, I'm not joking, okay?
[00:18:13.687 --> 00:18:14.448]  They're going to love it all.
[00:18:15.188 --> 00:18:17.249]  They'll cheerlead if I'm taking off to some camp.
[00:18:17.509 --> 00:18:18.729]  They'll be on the radio talking about it.
[00:18:18.929 --> 00:18:20.069]  I mean, they're just going to love it.
[00:18:22.370 --> 00:18:24.030]  They're going to love it when their pension funds are taken.
[00:18:24.070 --> 00:18:31.192]  These people are so cult-like that when the dollars devalued, they'll love it or blame it on some imaginary foreign enemy with a big beard.
[00:18:32.653 --> 00:18:33.693]  These people are scum.
[00:18:38.374 --> 00:18:43.856]  Again, if you just joined us, I believe the government's really getting ready to go into World War III, and they'll stage terror attacks in this country.
[00:18:44.657 --> 00:18:47.778]  They will blame it on Hezbollah or Hamas tied into Al-Qaeda.
[00:18:49.619 --> 00:18:51.500]  We are now on a red alert for the first time.
[00:18:53.402 --> 00:18:54.243]  We're good to go.
[00:19:17.183 --> 00:19:21.667]  But again, the attack could be a nuke going off, a series of dirty bombs.
[00:19:22.067 --> 00:19:24.549]  It could be a smallpox or bird flu release.
[00:19:25.150 --> 00:19:26.091]  It could be anything.
[00:19:26.271 --> 00:19:28.213]  And we are going to go off the deep end.
[00:19:28.913 --> 00:19:31.876]  And the globalists are ready to have riots in this country.
[00:19:32.096 --> 00:19:33.237]  They're ready for resistance.
[00:19:33.778 --> 00:19:36.420]  They are ready for this country to be chewed up from end to end.
[00:19:36.861 --> 00:19:38.362]  They absolutely love it.
[00:19:39.203 --> 00:19:40.204]  We are just seeing...
[00:19:41.067 --> 00:19:44.251]  And so many cowardly Americans will believe whatever the government says.
[00:19:44.271 --> 00:19:50.898]  Though in their gut they'll know the government's behind it, they will do whatever the government says in the hope they can maintain their position.
[00:19:51.339 --> 00:19:52.841]  And that the golf courses will stay open.
[00:19:54.322 --> 00:19:56.465]  And of course, in the end, you'll be totally enslaved yourselves.
[00:19:56.525 --> 00:19:58.307]  But you're so stupid, you'll love it.
[00:19:58.607 --> 00:19:59.208]  We'll be right back.
[00:20:01.445 --> 00:20:02.205]  Terrorism.
[00:20:02.365 --> 00:20:03.106]  Terrorism.
[00:20:03.206 --> 00:20:04.046]  Chemical attacks.
[00:20:04.106 --> 00:20:04.787]  Dirty bombs.
[00:20:04.867 --> 00:20:05.287]  Fallout.
[00:20:05.367 --> 00:20:06.367]  Biological attack.
[00:20:06.568 --> 00:20:07.088]  Anthrax.
[00:20:07.168 --> 00:20:09.269]  And to top it all off, duct tape and plastic.
[00:20:09.529 --> 00:20:11.130]  Alarming words for our time.
[00:20:11.370 --> 00:20:13.851]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[00:20:14.231 --> 00:20:28.799]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:20:28.839 --> 00:20:29.159]  government.
[00:20:29.339 --> 00:20:31.120]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:37.424]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[00:20:37.544 --> 00:20:42.047]  If you're not the type who waits until it's too late, then you need the video sheltering in place.
[00:20:42.307 --> 00:20:47.710]  Get the critical information you need now for only $29 plus shipping by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:20:47.810 --> 00:20:49.031]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:20:49.091 --> 00:20:49.411]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:20:49.671 --> 00:20:51.713]  Or order on the web at murkywater.com.
[00:21:01.778 --> 00:21:04.099]  Here it is folks, the 2006 Redbook.
[00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:07.101]  The most comprehensive edition ever published.
[00:21:07.842 --> 00:21:11.484]  Midas Resources believes our clients should be as informed as possible.
[00:21:12.264 --> 00:21:13.725]  It includes the history of U.S.
[00:21:13.805 --> 00:21:17.908]  coins, the actual mintages, the grading standards.
[00:21:18.528 --> 00:21:20.189]  Learn the stability of real money.
[00:21:20.609 --> 00:21:22.650]  Protect yourself from fiat currencies.
[00:21:23.071 --> 00:21:24.592]  They are instruments of debt.
[00:21:24.852 --> 00:21:26.873]  Feel the comfort and safety of real money.
[00:21:27.449 --> 00:21:31.513]  Midas will send you the 2006 Red Book and a genuine silver dollar for just $22.95 delivered.

[00:21:53.461 --> 00:21:54.181]  1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:54.921 --> 00:22:03.947]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:22:04.607 --> 00:22:14.093]  Did you know that those seeking to destroy America and merge us into an all-powerful one world government said that they support every movement to centralize all authority in Washington, D.C.
[00:22:14.693 --> 00:22:16.915]  and therefore bypass the state governments?
[00:22:17.775 --> 00:22:21.457]  That way they would have only one battle to win, Washington, D.C.
[00:22:22.317 --> 00:22:28.479]  Have we witnessed the accumulation of power in Washington and bypassing the states over the last 50 years?
[00:22:29.100 --> 00:22:36.823]  We'd like to help you understand how these things are coming to pass by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[00:22:37.603 --> 00:22:39.083]  Just call our toll-free number, 1-800-
[00:22:40.664 --> 00:22:43.125]  That's 1-800-516-8736 to request your subscription.
[00:22:43.145 --> 00:22:43.365]  Call now.
[00:22:43.425 --> 00:22:45.446]  Operators are standing by to receive your call.
[00:22:57.873 --> 00:23:03.877]  I used to be ashamed of my toenails, so I thought I was destined to wear tennis shoes through the heat of the summer and hide my toes at the beach.
[00:23:04.277 --> 00:23:06.939]  And then my podiatrist told me about Non-X Nail Gel.
[00:23:07.099 --> 00:23:11.722]  It tackles unsightly nails by clearing out the cause of the problem, yellowing keratin debris buildup.
[00:23:11.882 --> 00:23:16.706]  With regular use, Non-X Gel breaks down and removes the debris, so toenails look clear.
[00:23:16.886 --> 00:23:21.629]  This summer, I'm wearing open-toed sandals again, thanks to a topical natural gel called Non-X.
[00:23:21.829 --> 00:23:24.511]  If your toenails are embarrassing, I recommend Non-X Nail Gel.
[00:23:24.751 --> 00:23:27.653]  It's at your pharmacy or mass retailer in the foot care section.
[00:23:28.913 --> 00:23:29.914]  Looking for profit?
[00:23:29.994 --> 00:23:31.394]  Looking for safety and security?
[00:23:31.714 --> 00:23:34.935]  The $10 Olympic commemorative gold coin offers both.
[00:23:34.975 --> 00:23:42.537]  This low mintage collector coin with a total series mintage under $600,000 has sold at four times its current price.
[00:23:42.597 --> 00:23:46.098]  Falling dollar values and inflation make this likely to happen again.
[00:23:46.358 --> 00:23:47.879]  Secure your position today.
[00:23:48.179 --> 00:23:49.319]  Call Midas Resources at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:23:49.439 --> 00:23:49.679]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:24:03.835 --> 00:24:09.880]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:13.503]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:15.504 --> 00:24:16.545]  Well, I'm sure of it.
[00:24:17.866 --> 00:24:23.030]  It is my second prediction ever on talk radio.
[00:24:23.050 --> 00:24:27.354]  The last one you heard was over five years ago, July 25th, and I did it for...
[00:24:28.385 --> 00:24:35.409]  Two months, month and a half straight until the morning of 9-11 and got up and continued the broadcast that day with exactly what I said would happen, unfortunately.
[00:24:36.630 --> 00:24:41.773]  And I can't really pick targets right now, though I've got to make myself watch TV now.
[00:24:41.813 --> 00:24:45.175]  That's where I'll pick up the pre-programming.
[00:24:45.215 --> 00:24:48.337]  See, they pre-write the script, have to condition everybody beforehand.
[00:24:48.357 --> 00:24:53.240]  I need to watch Fox TV, even their fiction shows.
[00:24:53.620 --> 00:24:57.303]  They will for sure, probably already aired exactly what they're going to do.
[00:24:57.343 --> 00:24:57.943]  It's part of their
[00:24:58.661 --> 00:25:00.483]  I guess an enjoyment or something they have.
[00:25:01.123 --> 00:25:04.406]  Part of the Tavistock Institute programming that everything runs off of.
[00:25:06.128 --> 00:25:08.090]  But here we are, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:25:09.031 --> 00:25:09.611]  Here we are.
[00:25:09.631 --> 00:25:16.458]  Again, I've said on air that they will escalate conflict in the Middle East between Israel and their neighbors.
[00:25:18.419 --> 00:25:21.682]  Then we will have a string of people being busted.
[00:25:21.702 --> 00:25:23.224]  This is all happening simultaneously.
[00:25:24.105 --> 00:25:26.586]  Which will turn out to be fake terror groups.
[00:25:26.906 --> 00:25:29.727]  Total setups where you can prove that, which we've done now.
[00:25:31.227 --> 00:25:37.850]  And then you would have the government basically go to the highest level of alert and say we can't always protect you.
[00:25:38.530 --> 00:25:43.272]  That we did see neocons on TV saying the peaceniks are going to cause another terror attack.
[00:25:43.312 --> 00:25:44.272]  There with bin Laden.
[00:25:44.632 --> 00:25:45.672]  We're now hearing that.
[00:25:46.093 --> 00:25:48.714]  England is saying this is like the Blitz and they're facing Hitler.
[00:25:49.074 --> 00:25:49.954]  Stiff upper lip.
[00:25:50.775 --> 00:25:59.203]  And out of that, out of the midst of that, you will see a huge terror attack in the Western world that will then be blamed on the Middle East.
[00:25:59.923 --> 00:26:01.745]  In fact, it may not even be directly blamed.
[00:26:01.785 --> 00:26:02.426]  It's like Iraq.
[00:26:02.466 --> 00:26:07.630]  It doesn't have anything to do with 9-11, regardless of whose story you believe, the true one or the official fable.
[00:26:08.051 --> 00:26:08.911]  And they still went in there.
[00:26:10.192 --> 00:26:17.459]  And I'm talking within days of this A-bomb going off in Chicago or Dallas or Houston or even New York.
[00:26:19.275 --> 00:26:21.177]  It could be LA, it could be San Francisco.
[00:26:22.278 --> 00:26:26.102]  Within days, it could even be hours, you will see, but they need a few days to let it sink in.
[00:26:26.382 --> 00:26:34.871]  Within 48 hours, a huge nuking op of Iran, total destruction of their facilities, hundreds of mini-nukes raining down, which Israel's now bought.
[00:26:36.232 --> 00:26:38.375]  You will just see...
[00:26:40.248 --> 00:26:41.389]  Total police state here.
[00:26:41.890 --> 00:26:45.393]  And, of course, the stock market plunging as all this happens.
[00:26:45.773 --> 00:26:46.614]  No one will point out.
[00:26:46.654 --> 00:26:50.998]  The globals are so arrogant, they'll have huge insider trading on everything, and they'll all pre-position themselves.
[00:26:51.018 --> 00:26:55.542]  In fact, we need to be looking at all the stocks right now in the next month to two months leading up to this.
[00:26:55.842 --> 00:27:01.707]  Again, this is something that a 10,000-person agency with people with 180 IQs could hardly keep track of.
[00:27:01.888 --> 00:27:04.770]  So there's no way we can keep track of all of it and analyze all of it.
[00:27:04.930 --> 00:27:06.612]  We've just seen so many past patterns.
[00:27:07.252 --> 00:27:08.413]  Again, we can't watch it all.
[00:27:08.433 --> 00:27:10.393]  You need to watch it for us, okay?
[00:27:10.834 --> 00:27:18.777]  We need to be collating this data, watching closely, so that when they carry out these attacks, which is pretty much going to happen, again, we can stop it.
[00:27:18.797 --> 00:27:20.257]  I want to make clear with my prediction.
[00:27:21.458 --> 00:27:32.522]  I said in 2001, months before the attack, I said if you call every talk radio show, if you write articles about it, if you warn everyone, if there's enough of a buzz, it will freak them out, it will freak the globalists out,
[00:27:33.729 --> 00:27:38.711]  And they may just fearmonger and kind of get a boost in the polls off of, oh, we foiled an attack.
[00:27:38.731 --> 00:27:45.134]  They may just leave it there or maybe have a truck bomb or something go off in London or New York, something smaller.
[00:27:45.514 --> 00:27:46.435]  It's still going to be bad.
[00:27:47.735 --> 00:27:51.057]  If we don't, they're going to go with full-bore martial law.
[00:27:52.136 --> 00:27:57.060]  And you can all watch the canary in the coal mine, Alex Jones, and see if they come by and grab me or what happens.
[00:27:57.381 --> 00:28:10.672]  But it's so sophisticated now in their propaganda, they may even let me stay up here and chirp and squawk, thinking that that's some type of counter system where they know, well, if he's still on the air, which everybody says, then how could it be real?
[00:28:13.214 --> 00:28:14.255]  So that's what they're doing.
[00:28:14.275 --> 00:28:17.878]  It's like Hitler even left a few Jewish movie stars in there right through 1944.
[00:28:20.184 --> 00:28:21.445]  Again, that's on record.
[00:28:21.465 --> 00:28:23.787]  Because, oh, well, it can't be that bad.
[00:28:23.827 --> 00:28:28.171]  I mean, look, he's still on the German cinema, or she's still on the German cinema.
[00:28:29.352 --> 00:28:34.356]  But, yes, the big joke around here is I'm the canary in the coal mine, and I certainly am.
[00:28:35.216 --> 00:28:38.259]  And I'm here just watching these murdering pieces of trash.
[00:28:38.799 --> 00:28:46.605]  Last night I was on some gunny-something show out of Denver, and I just got so sick of it, I just blew up at the guy.
[00:28:47.106 --> 00:28:48.287]  He was sitting there sniveling.
[00:28:48.948 --> 00:28:51.810]  And he was going, he'd go, well, give me proof of the government in 9-11.
[00:28:52.150 --> 00:28:54.251]  I tried to give proof, and he'd go, show me, show me the facts.
[00:28:54.271 --> 00:28:54.711]  You can't.
[00:28:54.911 --> 00:28:56.572]  And he never even let me show the facts.
[00:28:57.393 --> 00:29:01.795]  You understand, it's that tactic of lawyerly, answer the question.
[00:29:01.835 --> 00:29:02.535]  I said, answer it.
[00:29:02.816 --> 00:29:06.538]  Where, again, they don't even let you respond.
[00:29:06.578 --> 00:29:09.399]  It's just, and I brought up that Bush is anti-gun.
[00:29:09.439 --> 00:29:10.900]  He's like, no, that's not true.
[00:29:10.920 --> 00:29:12.761]  You know, it's just...
[00:29:14.096 --> 00:29:16.118]  American Union, that's not true.
[00:29:16.138 --> 00:29:17.058]  None of it's true.
[00:29:17.258 --> 00:29:19.200]  And these are the so-called conservatives.
[00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:21.201]  These are buckets of filth.
[00:29:21.762 --> 00:29:23.023]  Buckets of pus.
[00:29:24.704 --> 00:29:26.405]  These people are sick.
[00:29:28.847 --> 00:29:38.134]  I mean, how are we supposed to behave when we have murdering terrorists that have already killed a bunch of us, in control, and you can see all the indicators of a lead-up.
[00:29:39.135 --> 00:29:39.615]  This is it.
[00:29:40.208 --> 00:29:41.229]  The balloon's going up.
[00:29:41.309 --> 00:29:45.431]  I'm telling you right now, I have been focusing on this intently.
[00:29:46.331 --> 00:29:47.912]  I know what I'm talking about.
[00:29:48.092 --> 00:29:48.912]  This is the big one.
[00:29:51.794 --> 00:29:52.714]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.194 --> 00:29:54.795]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.716 --> 00:29:58.397]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.385 --> 00:30:04.248]  So, Janice, where are you and Jim going on vacation this summer?
[00:30:04.268 --> 00:30:08.312]  Definitely somewhere with a beach, though who knows if our feet will even touch the sand.
[00:30:08.533 --> 00:30:12.276]  That reminds me, Janice, have you figured out how to talk to Jim about his problem?
[00:30:12.397 --> 00:30:15.300]  No, I want to, but men can be so sensitive.
[00:30:15.500 --> 00:30:16.681]  Well, it's only going to get worse.
[00:30:17.121 --> 00:30:19.202]  Remember, I was going through the same thing with Dan.
[00:30:19.382 --> 00:30:21.122]  Then I found Mycoside NS.
[00:30:21.322 --> 00:30:22.482]  What's Mycoside NS?
[00:30:22.822 --> 00:30:26.143]  Mycoside NS kills the germs that can cause fungal infections.
[00:30:26.403 --> 00:30:27.603]  It worked great for Dan.
[00:30:27.743 --> 00:30:29.804]  He had the worst looking, thick yellow toenails.
[00:30:30.044 --> 00:30:31.724]  Now his nails look clear and healthy.
[00:30:31.864 --> 00:30:32.844]  Do I need a prescription?
[00:30:33.125 --> 00:30:38.806]  No, you can get Mycoside NS antifungal treatment in the foot care aisle at any drugstore or major retailer.
[00:30:38.926 --> 00:30:39.946]  And it really worked?
[00:30:40.186 --> 00:30:41.667]  Yep, it works on me, too.
[00:30:41.847 --> 00:30:43.908]  I had some white discolorations on my toe.
[00:30:44.028 --> 00:30:46.069]  I just applied Mycoside NS daily.
[00:30:46.189 --> 00:30:47.990]  I didn't even have to remove my nail polish.
[00:30:48.250 --> 00:30:48.970]  Sounds easy.
[00:30:49.110 --> 00:30:50.931]  I can start planning our beach getaway.
[00:30:51.131 --> 00:30:55.353]  Yeah, Mycoside definitely gave us the confidence to bare our feet again.
[00:30:55.633 --> 00:30:58.595]  Pick up Mycoside NS at drugstores and major retailers.
[00:30:58.675 --> 00:31:00.536]  Look for a free bonus gift in each box.
[00:31:01.132 --> 00:31:06.193]  Black Berkey purification elements are more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[00:31:06.273 --> 00:31:13.555]  These awesome elements are used in Berkey purification systems and they can also be used to upgrade most other gravity filtration systems.
[00:31:13.715 --> 00:31:21.577]  They can purify raw, untreated water by removing pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, trihalomethanes, and chemicals such as chlorine.
[00:31:24.559 --> 00:31:29.102]  These elements also reduce unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[00:31:29.382 --> 00:31:34.365]  Unbelievably, they even remove small microparticulate from water like food coloring particles.
[00:31:34.585 --> 00:31:37.527]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:31:37.747 --> 00:31:47.574]  Moreover, because they are recleanable, black Berkey elements are more economical than the standard disposable elements, providing fresh, pure water for less than two cents per gallon.
[00:31:47.654 --> 00:31:52.481]  Get a two-pack for only $99 or a four-pack for only $188 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:31:52.581 --> 00:31:54.625]  That's 888-803-4438 or order on the web at BerkeyWater.com.
[00:32:02.819 --> 00:32:06.981]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass?
[00:32:07.201 --> 00:32:08.981]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[00:32:09.241 --> 00:32:15.584]  If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough, the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[00:32:15.884 --> 00:32:22.066]  Using a similar principle, Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[00:32:22.306 --> 00:32:29.789]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions with no side effects.
[00:32:29.889 --> 00:32:29.949]  1-866-885-6625
[00:33:02.282 --> 00:33:05.024]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[00:33:05.044 --> 00:33:08.967]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:10.008 --> 00:33:16.313]  Alright, let me just lay it out in the wide scheme of things.
[00:33:17.961 --> 00:33:23.865]  We have exhaustively evidenced and documented that criminal elements are in control of the U.S.
[00:33:23.925 --> 00:33:40.777]  government, the British government, and most European governments, and are openly writing books, writing laws, publishing, organizing systems of global government, global taxation, global regulation, with no personal individual liberty or freedom within those systems.
[00:33:40.977 --> 00:33:44.140]  Global one-child policies, forced sterilization.
[00:33:44.660 --> 00:33:45.981]  We know all this is going on.
[00:33:46.886 --> 00:33:52.828]  Governments have admitted that hundreds of times our government alone has premeditatedly killed U.S.
[00:33:52.868 --> 00:33:56.029]  citizens in chemical, biological, and radiological testing.
[00:33:56.249 --> 00:33:57.510]  So there's no debating that.
[00:33:57.790 --> 00:33:59.650]  A lot of you can't believe they carried out 9-11.
[00:33:59.710 --> 00:34:00.051]  Fine.
[00:34:00.271 --> 00:34:01.251]  Believe the fairy tale.
[00:34:01.391 --> 00:34:03.432]  Believe whatever type of baloney you want.
[00:34:03.752 --> 00:34:08.273]  But we know these criminals have carried out many other horrible things against the American people.
[00:34:08.313 --> 00:34:12.715]  We know that the criminal global corporations, the global crime syndicate, has a motive.
[00:34:13.355 --> 00:34:25.266]  End staging terror attacks for weapons sales, trillions in oil, domestic police state crackdowns, not being questioned domestically when trillions are missing from the Pentagon, looting the Treasury.
[00:34:25.526 --> 00:34:26.366]  It's all happening.
[00:34:26.987 --> 00:34:28.028]  It's all happening!
[00:34:30.991 --> 00:34:37.295]  It is public, it is admitted, it is in mainstream news, but calmly being announced that we are now in the American Union.
[00:34:37.595 --> 00:34:38.035]  The U.S.
[00:34:38.075 --> 00:34:43.458]  and Canada are being merged officially through the executive agencies right now.
[00:34:44.819 --> 00:34:50.182]  Every facet of our lives is being removed from our own control and our elected representatives' control.
[00:34:50.822 --> 00:34:56.025]  From Congress, from state reps, from county commissioners, city councilmen and women, school boards.
[00:34:57.774 --> 00:35:06.382]  The dollar is being purposefully debased and devalued to then be rolled into the Amero when they claim that the dollar has failed the new American Union currency.
[00:35:08.024 --> 00:35:10.085]  The BATF has been doubled in size.
[00:35:10.126 --> 00:35:12.648]  The police are training nationwide for gun confiscation.
[00:35:13.148 --> 00:35:15.671]  All admitted, all mainstream news.
[00:35:16.231 --> 00:35:20.775]  Preachers have been prepared in 13,000 plus counties to tell their members...
[00:35:22.228 --> 00:35:27.394]  To tell their parishioners to go to the FEMA camps, to take the shots, to let their families be split up.
[00:35:27.734 --> 00:35:32.599]  This is their own internal and public documents we've had preachers on covering it.
[00:35:32.820 --> 00:35:33.961]  This is real.
[00:35:36.269 --> 00:35:45.697]  Massive preparations have been made for the total sacking of this country's liberties and freedoms for this new elite to totally take down the United States.
[00:35:45.978 --> 00:35:49.961]  The end of the country is at hand now.
[00:35:50.361 --> 00:35:51.102]  N-O-W now.
[00:35:56.952 --> 00:35:58.494]  But business as usual goes on.
[00:35:58.534 --> 00:35:59.434]  You go to Walmart.
[00:35:59.454 --> 00:36:00.596]  You go to the coffee shop.
[00:36:00.636 --> 00:36:01.777]  You go to the bar.
[00:36:01.817 --> 00:36:02.878]  You go to the park.
[00:36:02.978 --> 00:36:03.618]  Whatever.
[00:36:03.719 --> 00:36:04.920]  Everything's la-la.
[00:36:05.400 --> 00:36:09.004]  You know, there's still People Magazine with all the Hollywood stars on the cover.
[00:36:09.064 --> 00:36:11.646]  And you're still worried because you're five pounds overweight.
[00:36:11.726 --> 00:36:13.308]  Or you're still just out.
[00:36:13.328 --> 00:36:14.349]  Or what can you do?
[00:36:14.389 --> 00:36:15.510]  And that's just the way it is.
[00:36:15.570 --> 00:36:17.331]  Or, oh, that guy goes too far.
[00:36:17.572 --> 00:36:18.873]  No, I'm not going too far.
[00:36:19.013 --> 00:36:19.774]  I'm normal.
[00:36:21.372 --> 00:36:22.473]  I know they've been caught.
[00:36:22.533 --> 00:36:27.976]  The White House, Ari Fleischer admitted before he resigned that they're issuing fake terror alerts for political purposes.
[00:36:28.896 --> 00:36:31.637]  I have MSNBC article right here in front of me.
[00:36:31.717 --> 00:36:33.919]  I have CBS News article.
[00:36:34.219 --> 00:36:40.422]  This is from 2002, by the way, about fake terror alerts.
[00:36:40.862 --> 00:36:40.422]  2003.
[00:36:40.882 --> 00:36:42.423]  2001.
[00:36:41.823 --> 00:36:42.423]  Here's another one.
[00:36:42.743 --> 00:36:44.544]  Alerts tied to memo flap.
[00:36:44.884 --> 00:36:49.947]  Joseph Curl, The Washington Times, again with Ari Fleischer admitting they're issuing fake terror alerts.
[00:36:50.720 --> 00:36:58.806]  We are now under a red-level alert right now, ladies and gentlemen, and you read off the White House own website, that is martial law.
[00:37:00.608 --> 00:37:03.790]  That is the implementation of martial law.
[00:37:03.810 --> 00:37:05.151]  Now, they've announced we're under it.
[00:37:05.171 --> 00:37:07.353]  That's like saying you're under arrest.
[00:37:07.393 --> 00:37:09.495]  Let's see if they grab us and put the country in handcuffs.
[00:37:12.277 --> 00:37:17.221]  They have taken the airports and used them as training centers to be searched, to be yelled at, to be laughed at.
[00:37:18.414 --> 00:37:25.617]  I openly admit that is training to go nationwide on the streets of America, on the highways of America, in the shopping malls of America.
[00:37:25.657 --> 00:37:27.058]  We told you they'd be doing this.
[00:37:27.258 --> 00:37:34.862]  And now Viper teams from Dallas to Miami, part of the federal government, are out randomly just lined up researching you when the border stays wide open.
[00:37:34.962 --> 00:37:36.863]  It is a sick joke.
[00:37:37.383 --> 00:37:39.484]  The government carried out the attacks.
[00:37:40.347 --> 00:37:40.787]  We're good to go.
[00:37:40.807 --> 00:37:41.248]  We're good to go.
[00:38:07.219 --> 00:38:12.042]  In the Western world by, at the latest, late October.
[00:38:15.084 --> 00:38:16.946]  I'm telling you this right now.
[00:38:18.547 --> 00:38:20.528]  And, of course, I'm stepping up again to the plate.
[00:38:21.088 --> 00:38:25.351]  When people call talk shows and people call the White House, they will yet again hear my name.
[00:38:26.052 --> 00:38:29.614]  They will then again be inches away from sending a hit squad down here.
[00:38:29.914 --> 00:38:33.557]  But that will make it that much more obvious if they crush me, and so be it.
[00:38:34.694 --> 00:38:42.299]  I'm just telling you right now, I love life, and I'm not suicidal, by the way, I want to add, and I'm not going to do anything violent either.
[00:38:42.339 --> 00:38:43.479]  I'm not going to let them spin this.
[00:38:43.679 --> 00:38:59.349]  I am up front saying I know the White House is the front men for a criminal regime of military-industrial complex cold warriors who carried out 9-11 and carried out Oklahoma City and carried out the first attack at the World Trade Center in 1993.
[00:39:00.089 --> 00:39:01.490]  On the record, this is all on the record,
[00:39:02.245 --> 00:39:13.593]  And I know you're a bunch of murdering killers, and I'm not going to stand by while you blow up some city and all the images of dead toddlers we're going to see getting fished out of the daycares.
[00:39:14.094 --> 00:39:19.898]  I am just not going to sit by and watch you kill a bunch of my countrymen again.
[00:39:19.918 --> 00:39:26.623]  And I'm going to do everything I can to get everybody to be aware of what you are doing.
[00:39:29.776 --> 00:39:31.577]  I want you to get mad out there, people.
[00:39:31.637 --> 00:39:32.658]  I want you to get angry.
[00:39:32.698 --> 00:39:33.839]  I want you to get focused.
[00:39:35.120 --> 00:39:39.803]  I want all the writers who are out there to write articles about my analysis, your analysis.
[00:39:40.304 --> 00:39:41.445]  I mean, it's simple.
[00:39:41.505 --> 00:39:46.648]  We've got to flood the Internet, flood the message boards, get it out to everybody like we've never done before.
[00:39:47.049 --> 00:39:51.692]  This is Operation Expose the Government Terrorist, Op 2.
[00:39:52.312 --> 00:39:53.754]  This is Operation Number 2.
[00:39:55.672 --> 00:39:57.534]  I am predicting that if we don't have a maximum effort
[00:40:18.658 --> 00:40:27.685]  To expose government-sponsored terror and show people how they're gearing up in Israel, saying they want to attack Iran, saying this is World War III, saying Iran's going to attack us.
[00:40:28.025 --> 00:40:30.207]  Iran has no motive to attack this country.
[00:40:30.687 --> 00:40:34.210]  And Iran's leadership is on record saying they believe our government is behind the terror.
[00:40:35.431 --> 00:40:36.551]  Just look at common sense.
[00:40:37.292 --> 00:40:42.616]  And if we do stop it in the next few months, then we're in danger again coming up on the next election.
[00:40:44.463 --> 00:40:54.710]  And then, if I see the confluence, the intersection of all this data, and give you another alert, it'll be, oh, it didn't happen in 2006 when Alex said it would.
[00:40:56.591 --> 00:40:57.852]  But you see, I was right about 9-11.
[00:40:58.393 --> 00:41:00.394]  This is my second warning ever.
[00:41:01.054 --> 00:41:02.415]  There's only been two.
[00:41:03.456 --> 00:41:04.176]  This is it.
[00:41:04.777 --> 00:41:09.320]  I'm telling you right now, unfortunately, I'm going to be proven right again.
[00:41:10.231 --> 00:41:15.733]  We have a small chance that I'll be proven wrong, and I will be attacked by the newspapers with pleasure.
[00:41:16.954 --> 00:41:19.555]  They won't talk about the other incident because it's too damning for them.
[00:41:20.415 --> 00:41:21.356]  Talk about prior knowledge.
[00:41:21.396 --> 00:41:25.878]  I mean, you've got a talk show host on air saying they're going to attack the World Trade Center and blame it on their asset bin Laden.
[00:41:26.438 --> 00:41:28.019]  They're going to hijack and blow up planes.
[00:41:29.339 --> 00:41:30.360]  That video's on the web.
[00:41:30.420 --> 00:41:31.040]  It's audio.
[00:41:31.080 --> 00:41:31.620]  It's all there.
[00:41:33.741 --> 00:41:35.302]  So that's it, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:41:35.402 --> 00:41:37.763]  That is what we have laying out before us.
[00:41:40.260 --> 00:42:05.522]  Every indicator from past patterns and the operations and how they operate in my study of them shows me that the highest probability of large-scale terror attacks conducted for psychological warfare reasons against the people of England, the U.S., or Israel will be within the next two months.
[00:42:07.955 --> 00:42:15.518]  The next two months from the 10th through the 25th or so of October.
[00:42:15.918 --> 00:42:18.839]  That is the most dangerous time.
[00:42:23.220 --> 00:42:28.322]  And, of course, it will come out in a day or two that either one of two things.
[00:42:28.442 --> 00:42:37.025]  Either that the people they've grabbed are on welfare and registered as mentally retarded or homeless, one.
[00:42:39.432 --> 00:43:06.813]  Or two, the leader of the group will be some deep MI6 agent who's Muslim, who is leading the group and was trying to get them to board planes, but as soon as the group refused to board planes with the bombs, because the government likes to go out and actually order the attacks through patsies, or through useful idiots, and then we'll hear about, oh yeah, the leader of the group was a government agent, and yeah, they did entrap them, but you know, that's...
[00:43:09.324 --> 00:43:20.657]  And then again, the globalists succeed even if they don't carry out the attack in the next two months, which I believe it looks like they're going to do, because it still trains us to be afraid, trains us they're the leaders, trains us now we can't even take a bottle of water on our own plane.
[00:43:21.277 --> 00:43:23.460]  You know, when you go on the plane, you can't take your own, I guess...
[00:43:25.077 --> 00:43:28.060]  Let's say they've got a Slotsky's Deli outside the Austin Airport.
[00:43:28.160 --> 00:43:30.321]  Oh no, don't take your Slotsky's bag on.
[00:43:30.341 --> 00:43:33.384]  You're all prisoners, just like the public school kids are prisoners.
[00:43:33.704 --> 00:43:38.688]  Everyone's searched, and everyone's scanned, and the government openly says it's to train you how to be prisoners.
[00:43:38.949 --> 00:43:42.772]  And the general public doesn't read what Homeland Security says, so they're not even aware of it.
[00:43:43.032 --> 00:43:47.355]  We're being engineered like animals to be domesticated.
[00:43:51.499 --> 00:43:53.901]  I want to defeat these people so bad.
[00:43:57.854 --> 00:44:19.740]  Every 9-11 event that's coming up in, what on September 8th in Philadelphia, what is it, September 10th in New York, we're having a 9-11 event on August 26th in Dallas at the Lakewood Theater.
[00:44:21.101 --> 00:44:21.661]  Jim Mars.
[00:44:22.201 --> 00:44:31.825]  Everybody needs to come to these events, and all the other events around the country, and you need to call all the media when those events are happening, so those are kind of nexus points for press coverage.
[00:44:32.105 --> 00:44:42.829]  The press are kind of like fish, and where you're out in the ocean and you don't have any real coral reefs, and you kind of throw a wreck or something in there, or some focal point, that's kind of how I see a 9-11 truth event.
[00:44:44.927 --> 00:44:46.588]  Even a movie screening with some speakers.
[00:44:47.909 --> 00:44:52.151]  You can't get reporters just to out of the blue because they're too cowardly to report on 9-11.
[00:44:52.471 --> 00:44:56.674]  So what you've got to get them to do is kind of like fish coming into an artificial coral reef.
[00:44:56.934 --> 00:44:58.215]  That's what these little events are.
[00:44:58.495 --> 00:45:00.676]  That gets them an excuse to, quote, come cover it.
[00:45:00.916 --> 00:45:02.617]  That lets their editors allow them to do it.
[00:45:04.038 --> 00:45:14.524]  And so we need to... Dallas is a little coral reef and New York's going to be a big coral reef and all these other events are little coral reefs to get the press to cover it, to get it out there more.
[00:45:16.377 --> 00:45:18.217]  I have to give you one analogy, don't I, Dave?
[00:45:21.318 --> 00:45:22.018]  A king of those.
[00:45:24.219 --> 00:45:25.699]  So, this is it.
[00:45:27.059 --> 00:45:30.200]  Everything we've talked about, and you know, you haven't heard me say this is it in a long time.
[00:45:31.220 --> 00:45:31.780]  Five years.
[00:45:32.600 --> 00:45:34.821]  And, I don't know, what is it, 15 days?
[00:45:35.121 --> 00:45:35.961]  Five years, 15 days.
[00:45:37.021 --> 00:45:37.901]  Since I last warned you.
[00:45:37.921 --> 00:45:42.202]  I mean, I've said we're in greater danger of it the next year, or they could pull something.
[00:45:42.242 --> 00:45:44.683]  We predicted a lot of the events, but we were never sure of it.
[00:45:45.982 --> 00:45:49.165]  And I can tell you that this is it.
[00:45:50.065 --> 00:45:51.306]  I can see all the indicators.
[00:45:51.326 --> 00:45:52.247]  They're going ahead with it.
[00:45:53.268 --> 00:46:11.882]  I can see, when I look at the psychopaths on TV, Bush and Blair and their controllers, they've got that criminal glare, like when a bank robber goes into the bank and is pulling the ski mask over their face, that sharkish, psycho, kind of sexual excitement look in them.
[00:46:14.039 --> 00:46:16.040]  There's a lot of things I enter into my equation.
[00:46:17.041 --> 00:46:18.602]  And there's all the other indicators.
[00:46:18.682 --> 00:46:23.584]  And they're not looking as afraid and freaked out as they were just a few months ago.
[00:46:24.045 --> 00:46:25.706]  And that's because they've been given go-ahead.
[00:46:26.326 --> 00:46:27.847]  These guys are all about action.
[00:46:28.267 --> 00:46:29.288]  You can't say they're not.
[00:46:30.028 --> 00:46:32.029]  And they're running it off right now.
[00:46:33.050 --> 00:46:34.330]  The teams are in place.
[00:46:35.171 --> 00:46:42.255]  I would imagine the bombs are... The weaponry is in warehouses, ready to be delivered.
[00:46:43.496 --> 00:47:00.500]  A simple phone call will be made from a private corporate body, most likely, after a call is made to them from the Vice President, after he is given a call, of course, from higher-level globalists that are in the inner roundtable group.
[00:47:01.141 --> 00:47:06.222]  And then that order will go down from Cheney down to the private corporation through a black op system.
[00:47:07.702 --> 00:47:11.105]  To be bootlegged and covered and shielded by drills, which is key.
[00:47:11.165 --> 00:47:13.547]  These drills will be cropping up wherever you see the attack.
[00:47:13.887 --> 00:47:15.349]  It's always the same M.O.
[00:47:15.389 --> 00:47:16.370]  Now, they could switch it.
[00:47:16.470 --> 00:47:19.132]  Every once in a while, they may change something.
[00:47:19.572 --> 00:47:21.374]  They may go off script, but normally they don't.
[00:47:24.637 --> 00:47:26.879]  And we're going to see a lot of Americans die.
[00:47:27.079 --> 00:47:27.719]  It's going to be bad.
[00:47:28.720 --> 00:47:29.441]  It's going to be real bad.
[00:47:30.662 --> 00:47:32.363]  I believe it could be thermal nuclear.
[00:47:32.804 --> 00:47:33.564]  It could be atomic.
[00:47:34.965 --> 00:47:35.086]  It...
[00:47:37.637 --> 00:47:38.678]  It could be biological.
[00:47:38.778 --> 00:47:40.099]  They could go all the way.
[00:47:40.179 --> 00:47:56.913]  What I'm seeing shape up could be anything from 10 jetliners being hijacked and flown into buildings to truck bombs going off in 12 cities, and then the one group where they're able to provocateur and pay money, they'll be low-grade morons and they'll bust them in some other city.
[00:47:57.817 --> 00:47:59.198]  If it follows classic M.O.
[00:47:59.219 --> 00:48:00.420]  So, oh, we stopped one bombing.
[00:48:00.440 --> 00:48:03.102]  I forgot to give you that scenario.
[00:48:03.122 --> 00:48:03.863]  That's very probable.
[00:48:03.923 --> 00:48:05.765]  They go with the truck bomb scenario.
[00:48:05.805 --> 00:48:11.250]  They'll bust and stop one or two truck bombs, and 10 to 15 may go forward, but it's so hard to organize them.
[00:48:11.951 --> 00:48:13.232]  It kind of keeps the numbers down.
[00:48:14.213 --> 00:48:15.114]  Keep this stuff secret.
[00:48:17.196 --> 00:48:19.418]  But the worst-case scenario...
[00:48:20.129 --> 00:48:20.669]  We're good to go.
[00:48:45.498 --> 00:48:47.880]  Cross subspecies.
[00:48:48.461 --> 00:48:48.981]  What's the term?
[00:48:49.021 --> 00:48:49.762]  Derivations.
[00:48:49.822 --> 00:48:56.467]  The Asiatic variety of the Orientals that we have in Central Asia into the Middle East.
[00:48:56.527 --> 00:48:56.867]  I don't know.
[00:48:56.887 --> 00:49:01.191]  They can craft it down to that because you've got interbreeding in certain regions.
[00:49:01.211 --> 00:49:07.316]  So the Asians of the Middle East have also been mixed in with the Caucasians.
[00:49:07.736 --> 00:49:10.359]  So that's why you kind of have a hybrid in those regions.
[00:49:10.419 --> 00:49:12.340]  And a lot of times even with an African influence.
[00:49:13.181 --> 00:49:14.362]  But they've got to tailor it down.
[00:49:15.928 --> 00:49:16.388]  We're good to go.
[00:49:16.408 --> 00:49:16.669]  I think?
[00:49:34.818 --> 00:49:42.560]  And of course there'll be reports of men in black uniforms running around before the Arabs shoot themselves, and witnesses will say they saw men in black uniforms shooting everyone, but that won't matter.
[00:49:42.600 --> 00:49:47.642]  The dumb public doesn't even, 30% of the public doesn't even know what year 9-11 happened in a new poll.
[00:49:47.982 --> 00:49:51.503]  Guaranteed that 30% is the 30% that believes the official story.
[00:49:52.844 --> 00:49:56.945]  I will bet you all the tea in China that...
[00:50:01.084 --> 00:50:15.430]  The majority, I would say 27% of that 30% that doesn't know what year 9-11 happened, I will bet you, bottom dollar, that they are all official story supporters.
[00:50:17.030 --> 00:50:17.811]  It's just a no-brainer.
[00:50:18.231 --> 00:50:22.613]  In fact, it says they're 45 to 65, and of course, that's the perfect crowd.
[00:50:23.113 --> 00:50:26.174]  They're usually in a leadership position, even if it's at McDonald's.
[00:50:26.929 --> 00:50:33.711]  Or, you know, at the golf club or wherever it is, and so they're part of the system, and they're all little power trips, but they're elites.
[00:50:34.031 --> 00:50:34.551]  Oh, yeah.
[00:50:34.931 --> 00:50:37.811]  You know, I make $200,000 a year, they say.
[00:50:38.011 --> 00:50:39.752]  I'm an elite.
[00:50:39.792 --> 00:50:40.652]  You're nothing.
[00:50:41.612 --> 00:50:45.333]  You're nothing but the knife being drawn across this country's throat.
[00:50:46.873 --> 00:50:49.174]  We are seeing the United States go down.
[00:50:49.314 --> 00:50:50.094]  I mean, it's happening.
[00:50:50.394 --> 00:50:53.795]  Going down, down, down, and it makes me mad.
[00:50:55.131 --> 00:50:59.955]  Very unhappy and very sad, but at the same time I'm happy because I'm alive and kicking and fighting these murderers!
[00:51:04.618 --> 00:51:07.800]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[00:51:08.141 --> 00:51:10.082]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[00:51:10.442 --> 00:51:18.068]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:18.786 --> 00:51:25.830]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:51:26.230 --> 00:51:37.657]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:51:37.957 --> 00:51:41.459]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:51:41.919 --> 00:51:43.861]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:51:44.201 --> 00:51:48.023]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:52:53.806 --> 00:52:54.587]  We're good to go.
[00:53:17.845 --> 00:53:18.506]  We're good to go.
[00:53:47.364 --> 00:53:50.466]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[00:53:50.626 --> 00:53:56.489]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[00:54:07.609 --> 00:54:10.411]  Boy, that's fitting music for what we're facing right now.
[00:54:11.032 --> 00:54:15.275]  A group of hardcore, cold-blooded killers that know how dumbed down the public is.
[00:54:15.836 --> 00:54:19.979]  They've already stolen three-plus trillion dollars out of the Pentagon.
[00:54:19.999 --> 00:54:20.679]  People get confused.
[00:54:20.699 --> 00:54:21.860]  They go, you said a trillion.
[00:54:21.880 --> 00:54:22.541]  You said two trillion.
[00:54:23.121 --> 00:54:26.584]  No, it was over a trillion six years ago.
[00:54:26.604 --> 00:54:28.525]  Then it was two-plus trillion.
[00:54:28.906 --> 00:54:34.950]  Last time I checked in congressional hearings six months ago, plus, it was three-and-a-half-plus trillion.
[00:54:35.311 --> 00:54:35.591]  Okay?
[00:54:37.361 --> 00:54:40.142]  Just type in trillions missing from the Pentagon, you'll get AP.
[00:54:40.902 --> 00:54:43.222]  And the Pentagon, I got audio clips, says, we're not telling you.
[00:54:43.703 --> 00:54:45.543]  Okay, that's how criminal these people are.
[00:54:45.923 --> 00:54:47.663]  Oh, they'll steal trillions right in front of you.
[00:54:48.044 --> 00:54:53.645]  Oh, and they'll nerve gas our own troops in biological and chemical tests, but they wouldn't hurt us on 9-11.
[00:54:53.865 --> 00:54:58.026]  Oh, their own documents say they would, and they planned it, but they just ignore those.
[00:54:59.306 --> 00:55:01.367]  Let's just put American flags outside our houses.
[00:55:01.547 --> 00:55:02.587]  That makes us patriotic.
[00:55:02.767 --> 00:55:04.968]  Not defending the Bill of Rights that the flag symbolizes.
[00:55:05.088 --> 00:55:06.168]  Let's butcher that.
[00:55:09.256 --> 00:55:23.087]  And so now they've busted, oh, 21 people, just like all the other fake baloney leading up, and all the neocons are on TV and radio, and we need to nuke Iran, World War III, World War III is good.
[00:55:23.587 --> 00:55:27.050]  I mean, even Hitler didn't call World War II that he kicked off a good thing.
[00:55:27.070 --> 00:55:28.972]  He was always calling it something else.
[00:55:29.172 --> 00:55:30.233]  They're just out in the open.
[00:55:31.433 --> 00:55:37.058]  The general public's never died in a war, doesn't know what it's like, never lived in bombed out bomb shelters, never lived in a police state.
[00:55:37.637 --> 00:55:39.077]  So they're just all, yeah, kill them.
[00:55:39.117 --> 00:55:40.938]  It's like a TV show, a football game.
[00:55:41.178 --> 00:55:43.519]  Yeah, let's go into another country.
[00:55:43.579 --> 00:55:45.079]  Yeah, all right.
[00:55:45.379 --> 00:55:46.580]  Yeah.
[00:55:46.980 --> 00:55:51.041]  Just, just, I can't believe our government would be behind 9-11.
[00:55:51.281 --> 00:55:52.601]  You need to be arrested.
[00:55:52.901 --> 00:55:54.982]  You need to be taken off the radio.
[00:55:55.022 --> 00:55:55.382]  I get that.
[00:55:55.402 --> 00:55:56.923]  That's when they call and disagree.
[00:55:57.283 --> 00:55:57.903]  That's what they say.
[00:55:59.323 --> 00:56:02.084]  When they call here, they call me when I'm on my Sunday KLBJ show.
[00:56:02.504 --> 00:56:04.045]  They say, you need to be arrested.
[00:56:04.085 --> 00:56:05.505]  You don't need to be on the air.
[00:56:06.371 --> 00:56:09.597]  But America ain't a police state, but you need to be arrested.
[00:56:10.399 --> 00:56:18.455]  Yeah, because I can read the White House press secretary's quotes right off the White House website where he says they're staging fake terror alerts.
[00:56:21.102 --> 00:56:31.489]  Do you understand, you neocon little weaklings, you followers of the neocons, that the official government documents admit our government staged terror attacks against the American people and others in the past?
[00:56:31.869 --> 00:56:32.750]  Can't you get that?
[00:56:33.270 --> 00:56:35.151]  And you'll just say, it's not true, it's not true.
[00:56:35.331 --> 00:56:36.292]  Yes, it is true.
[00:56:37.012 --> 00:56:38.233]  Stop being cowards.
[00:56:40.915 --> 00:56:43.156]  Look, I know it's scary to admit this to yourself.
[00:56:45.137 --> 00:56:45.818]  And I'll say this.
[00:56:48.840 --> 00:56:53.323]  Now is the time to make copies of my videos like you've never made copies of them before.
[00:56:54.745 --> 00:56:57.006]  Let's hypothetically say they detonated a nuke in two months.
[00:56:59.068 --> 00:57:05.513]  It's pretty good to say you're not going to be able to get my videos anymore after that, and that's going to shut down, quote, because of technical difficulties.
[00:57:05.533 --> 00:57:08.255]  They'll bring in all their controls because there's, quote, terrorists online.
[00:57:08.635 --> 00:57:13.258]  If you've got it downloaded, if you've got a copy of it, if you're making copies, know that it'll be your job.
[00:57:13.318 --> 00:57:14.199]  Let's say they take over.
[00:57:14.239 --> 00:57:15.080]  Let's say it all happens.
[00:57:15.400 --> 00:57:18.062]  It'll be your job to covertly be part of the resistance.
[00:57:18.951 --> 00:57:31.016]  And to make copies of the films, and as it gets more and more obvious what we're facing, and as more and more of the public go into deeper denial, because you'll actually see, if they really take over, you'll see a lot of people at first, actually, who know what's going on decide to serve it out of fear.
[00:57:31.656 --> 00:57:35.478]  Now, over time, they'll start rebelling, but at first, the rebellion won't be that big.
[00:57:35.798 --> 00:57:36.738]  We have to get ready.
[00:57:37.198 --> 00:57:39.539]  We have to understand a lot of us are going to fall in this.
[00:57:39.579 --> 00:57:40.720]  A lot of us are going to be killed.
[00:57:41.220 --> 00:57:42.280]  A lot of us aren't going to make it.
[00:57:42.321 --> 00:57:43.401]  We have to be ready for that.
[00:57:44.989 --> 00:57:46.550]  We have to just commit up.
[00:57:46.610 --> 00:57:47.510]  This is America.
[00:57:47.890 --> 00:57:51.871]  We are not going to stop fighting, even if they totally seize us through another terror attack.
[00:57:53.352 --> 00:57:56.313]  Now, they could stage another terror attack, and it could literally blow up in their face.
[00:57:56.853 --> 00:57:57.913]  It could backfire on them, too.
[00:57:57.973 --> 00:58:00.754]  But I just, again, what we want to do is stop them now.
[00:58:00.794 --> 00:58:03.235]  We want to get the word out that they're about to stage attacks.
[00:58:03.395 --> 00:58:09.377]  Again, they're openly wanting to start World War III, folks, and saying Hezbollah and Hamas are here and are about to hit us and staging this new event.
[00:58:09.417 --> 00:58:10.638]  I mean, all the indicators are there.
[00:58:13.339 --> 00:58:13.879]  I'm begging you.
[00:58:15.456 --> 00:58:16.377]  I'm pleading with you.
[00:58:17.597 --> 00:58:23.400]  I'm asking you, from deep down in my guts, to look at my evidence.
[00:58:25.621 --> 00:58:27.342]  I'm talking to police officers out there.
[00:58:27.402 --> 00:58:28.142]  You're not children.
[00:58:28.443 --> 00:58:30.744]  Children think what they decide to believe is reality.
[00:58:31.104 --> 00:58:34.606]  Men and women know that reality is the cold hard facts.
[00:58:34.666 --> 00:58:36.406]  Listen, you know I'm telling you the truth.
[00:58:36.987 --> 00:58:38.347]  You better join us now.
[00:58:38.708 --> 00:58:39.308]  We'll be right back.
[00:58:41.158 --> 00:58:41.739]  We're good to go.
[00:58:57.173 --> 00:58:57.814]  Big Brother.
[00:58:58.494 --> 00:58:59.554]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.254 --> 00:59:01.374]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.035 --> 00:59:02.835]  You want answers?
[00:59:03.575 --> 00:59:04.475]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:04.495 --> 00:59:08.836]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.316 --> 00:59:13.437]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:14.638 --> 00:59:16.578]  I've put out my second prediction ever.
[00:59:16.678 --> 00:59:21.819]  Last time I did it, I predicted the government would stage an attack on the World Trade Center and blame their asset, who some have been lauding.
[00:59:21.859 --> 00:59:24.340]  I then went into hijacked planes being blown up.
[00:59:25.086 --> 00:59:32.610]  Well, I'm telling you now, all the indicators tell me the crime syndicate will stage a terror attack between now and the 25th of October.
[00:59:32.690 --> 00:59:35.312]  Unless we totally get the word out, it's going to happen.
[00:59:35.352 --> 00:59:37.893]  We're going to have World War III, and it's all going to be staged.
[00:59:38.233 --> 00:59:48.939]  Mike Malloy, one of the best talk show hosts on Air America, one of the most hard-hitting former CNN producer, he'll be joining us coming up to talk about all this in the next segment, and I'll try to take your calls.
[00:59:49.279 --> 00:59:51.921]  Right now, Carl in Texas, then Ron in others.
[00:59:51.981 --> 00:59:52.641]  Carl, go ahead.
[00:59:53.413 --> 01:00:10.440]  Hi Alex, I was just for the sake of those who may think that electing Democrats this fall will save us, could you please spell out why not and why our so-called two-party system is just a theatrical distraction?
[01:00:12.071 --> 01:00:13.091]  Yes, I appreciate your call.
[01:00:13.171 --> 01:00:15.552]  I mean, it is a theatrical distraction at many levels.
[01:00:16.332 --> 01:00:23.674]  Getting a different party in overall will be good, just to separate power, because some of those freshmen may not be in total line with the globalists.
[01:00:23.734 --> 01:00:28.456]  Or to get good conservatives elected would be good, if you could find some more Ron Paul types.
[01:00:29.316 --> 01:00:31.336]  But no, both parties are bought off by the same elite.
[01:00:31.356 --> 01:00:33.317]  I mean, look at Lieberman, Bush, identical twins.
[01:00:34.017 --> 01:00:34.777]  It's the same thing.
[01:00:35.398 --> 01:00:36.698]  Let's talk to Ron in New York.
[01:00:36.778 --> 01:00:37.418]  Ron, go ahead.
[01:00:39.459 --> 01:00:39.979]  Hello, Alex.
[01:00:40.478 --> 01:00:41.058]  Yes, go ahead.
[01:00:41.218 --> 01:00:43.840]  Yes, I agree with what you're saying today.
[01:00:44.380 --> 01:00:47.341]  In fact, though, there's one or two caveats I have to add.
[01:00:48.362 --> 01:00:53.984]  Well, our leaders, if you will, I use that term loosely, leaders are massively evil.
[01:00:54.204 --> 01:00:55.385]  I've come to that conclusion.
[01:00:55.785 --> 01:01:03.049]  We have to face the fact that a good portion, I believe the majority of our population, is massively stupid.
[01:01:03.609 --> 01:01:07.951]  And that's what's enabling these people to do a lot of these things that they're doing.
[01:01:08.570 --> 01:01:13.374]  You're right when you say they're going to walk us into a major event, maybe even a war.
[01:01:13.734 --> 01:01:17.658]  I think you're wrong when you say it'll be as late as October.
[01:01:18.178 --> 01:01:20.720]  I think it'll probably be no later than mid-September.
[01:01:21.221 --> 01:01:24.764]  Bush has already ratcheted up the rhetoric.
[01:01:25.384 --> 01:01:30.468]  He has used the term Islamic fascism in a statement he made today.
[01:01:31.629 --> 01:01:34.051]  So, yeah, we're getting waltzed down the road.
[01:01:34.091 --> 01:01:34.732]  Plus, remember...
[01:01:35.342 --> 01:01:40.104]  These demonists and these men, they follow, I don't know, black magic.
[01:01:40.624 --> 01:01:41.605]  They like numbers.
[01:01:41.965 --> 01:01:45.907]  And keep in mind that August is a month in which World War I started.
[01:01:47.064 --> 01:01:50.025]  Needless to say, we're having conflicts in parts of the world.
[01:01:50.225 --> 01:01:51.185]  August 22nd.
[01:01:51.565 --> 01:01:51.825]  Right.
[01:01:52.345 --> 01:01:53.525]  August 22nd, right.
[01:01:53.585 --> 01:01:58.306]  Matter of fact, on Fox News, they've had their minions already throwing that number around.
[01:01:58.326 --> 01:02:04.267]  Yeah, but they're trying to claim that Ahmed Dinejad, with no evidence, plans to start World War III on the 22nd.
[01:02:04.647 --> 01:02:09.468]  Yes, and you should know also that, of course, everyone's aware of what's going on in the Middle East.
[01:02:11.749 --> 01:02:13.949]  Israel has three submarines now.
[01:02:14.622 --> 01:02:17.823]  Off the coast of Iran with surface-to-surface missiles.
[01:02:18.263 --> 01:02:19.424]  They're not there for nothing.
[01:02:19.764 --> 01:02:22.645]  Well, they have thermal nuclear cruise missiles on board.
[01:02:23.145 --> 01:02:32.388]  And also, if this plot, this so-called terror plot in England, was so bad, why did they wait until the brink in the last minute to do something about it?
[01:02:33.189 --> 01:02:37.050]  They even admit that Bush and Blair discussed this as far back as Sunday.
[01:02:37.390 --> 01:02:38.071]  And I'll answer that.
[01:02:38.111 --> 01:02:39.231]  That's a rhetorical question.
[01:02:39.682 --> 01:02:45.683]  Because if you're looking to use it for propaganda, midweek is the best time to get visibility in a news cycle.
[01:02:46.183 --> 01:02:50.944]  This is all choreographed political theatrics of the most wicked kind.
[01:02:51.004 --> 01:02:53.105]  They've been caught over and over again staging these.
[01:02:53.165 --> 01:02:53.765]  It's admitted.
[01:02:53.785 --> 01:02:57.826]  And what do they probably have in custody?
[01:02:59.446 --> 01:03:04.567]  21 stupid college sophomores who got involved in something they probably were, I guess.
[01:03:05.274 --> 01:03:06.535]  No, this is how it works.
[01:03:06.555 --> 01:03:12.060]  They get a, quote, leader, they spread around tons of cash, they just get one or two of them to talk about it on tape and agree with the leader.
[01:03:12.080 --> 01:03:12.920]  It's the same MO.
[01:03:13.201 --> 01:03:15.142]  And I'm afraid the way they're going to expand it.
[01:03:15.302 --> 01:03:22.208]  MSNBC reported about ten minutes ago that two men were arrested in Ohio, and they're afraid that they may have some connection to this.
[01:03:22.788 --> 01:03:26.091]  One of the men... Exactly, they're tying it into the Egyptians.
[01:03:26.411 --> 01:03:27.972]  Listen, Ron, I'm going to talk about that later.
[01:03:27.992 --> 01:03:30.955]  These are all key indicators you brought up, reasons I've been covering this.
[01:03:31.576 --> 01:03:32.938]  They're getting us ready for World War III.
[01:03:32.958 --> 01:03:34.359]  They're openly calling for it.
[01:03:34.379 --> 01:03:36.622]  They're staging these terror alerts, staging these events.
[01:03:37.223 --> 01:03:38.284]  We've caught them red-handed.
[01:03:38.865 --> 01:03:40.787]  We'll be right back on the other side with Mike Malloy.
[01:03:40.807 --> 01:03:42.209]  More of your phone calls coming up.
[01:03:42.649 --> 01:03:43.310]  We'll continue.
[01:03:43.350 --> 01:03:47.735]  We'll document and decipher what these criminals are doing.
[01:03:47.775 --> 01:03:48.216]  Stay with us.
[01:03:56.144 --> 01:03:59.305]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[01:03:59.665 --> 01:04:01.605]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[01:04:01.965 --> 01:04:09.627]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:04:10.307 --> 01:04:17.348]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:04:17.749 --> 01:04:20.709]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran.
[01:04:21.069 --> 01:04:23.390]  A White House program to disseminate fake news.
[01:04:23.810 --> 01:04:24.650]  NSA spies.
[01:04:25.140 --> 01:04:29.242]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:04:29.483 --> 01:04:32.985]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:04:33.465 --> 01:04:35.366]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:04:35.706 --> 01:04:39.609]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:04:52.950 --> 01:04:53.410]  Thank you.
[01:05:14.491 --> 01:05:26.521]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[01:05:26.641 --> 01:05:35.528]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[01:05:35.788 --> 01:05:39.070]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5.

[01:05:44.479 --> 01:05:44.920]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:05:53.982 --> 01:05:56.544]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here with an important question.
[01:05:56.704 --> 01:05:58.865]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[01:05:59.145 --> 01:06:09.232]  I mean the hard to find kind that's all natural and not full of corrosive toxins and chemicals and detergents that just dry out your skin and have been connected to very serious health problems?
[01:06:09.552 --> 01:06:11.874]  Let me tell you something about the Cal Bend Pure Soap Company.
[01:06:12.054 --> 01:06:16.155]  There's a 100% unconditional guarantee on all their wonderful products.
[01:06:16.355 --> 01:06:23.096]  They're all natural, they're triple concentrated, they're factory direct, factory owned and operated since 1947.
[01:06:23.316 --> 01:06:26.977]  Earth friendly, pure soaps for bathing, laundry and kitchen.
[01:06:27.137 --> 01:06:30.498]  Try pure soap once and I'll guarantee you'll never use anything else.
[01:06:30.798 --> 01:06:35.739]  Now for the first time, Cal Bend Pure Soap is available factory direct to you and your family.
[01:06:35.999 --> 01:06:39.141]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:39.181 --> 01:06:40.742]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:07:01.716 --> 01:07:04.678]  Well, we've had a lot of Mike Malloy fans email us.
[01:07:04.698 --> 01:07:06.359]  I've seen it on big websites I go to.
[01:07:06.639 --> 01:07:08.140]  Alex Jones is having Mike Malloy on.
[01:07:08.600 --> 01:07:10.041]  He better have him on for a long time.
[01:07:10.081 --> 01:07:15.084]  Listen, Mike's only got about 27, 26 minutes with us, or less, because he's got a lot of stuff going on today.
[01:07:15.104 --> 01:07:15.805]  We're honored to have him.
[01:07:15.825 --> 01:07:18.907]  He's got really the most popular, I think, show on Air America.
[01:07:19.387 --> 01:07:20.488]  It's definitely the hardest hitting.
[01:07:20.508 --> 01:07:23.690]  I mean, he lets people get on there and talk about 9-11 being an inside job.
[01:07:23.710 --> 01:07:25.571]  He talks about the crime family, the crime syndicate.
[01:07:26.167 --> 01:07:27.248]  We're good to go.
[01:07:27.268 --> 01:07:28.149]  We're good to go.
[01:07:49.986 --> 01:07:54.532]  His radio experience includes WSBAM in Atlanta, WLSAM Chicago.
[01:07:55.032 --> 01:08:04.664]  He's a nationally syndicated program, can be heard weeknights on affiliates of Air America radio station right here in Austin, Dallas, all over, and on XM Satellite Radio in addition to writing for CNN.
[01:08:05.957 --> 01:08:07.579]  Well, it's called networking, I think, Alex.
[01:08:24.213 --> 01:08:26.475]  Mike, look, I'll call a spade a spade.
[01:08:26.815 --> 01:08:29.036]  I have a stack of mainstream articles here in front of me.
[01:08:29.657 --> 01:08:40.243]  CBS News, MSNBC, Washington Times, Associated Press, White House transcript, WhiteHouse.gov, where they admit they've issued a bunch of fake terror alerts in the past for gain.
[01:08:40.463 --> 01:08:44.166]  We know they've staged busting patsies that they set up with explosives.
[01:08:44.546 --> 01:08:47.228]  England just did this a few months ago with shooting the innocent guy.
[01:08:48.008 --> 01:08:48.829]  We know this.
[01:08:48.869 --> 01:08:51.251]  My opinion is, the evidence shows, this is politically motivated.
[01:08:51.491 --> 01:08:53.013]  They're openly saying they want World War III.
[01:08:53.053 --> 01:08:55.495]  They're claiming Hamas is about to hit us any minute.
[01:08:55.735 --> 01:08:56.796]  Hezbollah is about to hit us.
[01:08:57.196 --> 01:08:58.978]  Only making Bush a dictator can save us.
[01:08:59.278 --> 01:09:01.540]  Mike Malloy, where do you see all this going?
[01:09:01.560 --> 01:09:05.584]  Alex, I think you are absolutely right.
[01:09:05.604 --> 01:09:08.946]  I think the effort here, and I'm laughing because I don't want to cry.
[01:09:08.966 --> 01:09:10.728]  I think the effort...
[01:09:13.714 --> 01:09:30.562]  I don't want to say a cabal of gnomes who sit in the basement somewhere under the steps of Tibet are engineering all this, but there is an effort, first of all, at taking the country and the world closer and closer to the brink.
[01:09:30.602 --> 01:09:32.463]  Now, what's the motivation?
[01:09:32.984 --> 01:09:34.184]  I, honest to God, don't know.
[01:09:34.204 --> 01:09:35.665]  A nuclear exchange...
[01:09:36.673 --> 01:09:40.761]  As you know, Alex, thermonuclear weapons will leave the planet uninhabitable.
[01:09:40.841 --> 01:09:42.424]  I don't know what these people have in mind.
[01:09:43.225 --> 01:09:48.796]  If it's population reduction, I have read a couple articles recently by some of these neocons.
[01:09:49.415 --> 01:09:57.119]  That the population of the Earth should be under 2 billion in order to provide the kind of lifestyle that some of them feel they're entitled to.
[01:09:57.239 --> 01:09:58.260]  Oh, yeah, they're out in the open.
[01:09:58.300 --> 01:09:58.640]  Oh, yeah.
[01:09:58.860 --> 01:10:04.883]  Yeah, and I've lost touch with this parallel universe that we're living in, Alex.
[01:10:04.983 --> 01:10:06.484]  I don't know what the hell to think anymore.
[01:10:06.564 --> 01:10:07.764]  I don't know which way is up.
[01:10:08.485 --> 01:10:10.086]  I see the death and destruction going on.
[01:10:10.126 --> 01:10:14.848]  This bit today, this red alert now that's spread to America, isn't it interesting?
[01:10:14.888 --> 01:10:18.330]  I'm sure it's just a coincidence, but this comes the day after Lieberman is defeated.
[01:10:19.186 --> 01:10:20.207]  I think that panicked him.
[01:10:20.267 --> 01:10:23.709]  I think it told him that the Democratic Party is about to go back to being populist.
[01:10:23.969 --> 01:10:25.590]  It's about to be seized by the people.
[01:10:25.771 --> 01:10:26.471]  I think you're right.
[01:10:26.631 --> 01:10:28.673]  And I think they know Republicans are mad, too.
[01:10:29.073 --> 01:10:39.800]  And Ken Millman's statement, or somebody's statement the other day after Lieberman's defeat, that obviously Democrats were the party that would guarantee...
[01:10:41.370 --> 01:10:43.331]  Ascendancy to the people who want to blow us up.
[01:10:43.352 --> 01:10:46.294]  This is the issue for the 2006 and the 2008 election, just like we had the bogus issues in 2002 and 2004.
[01:10:54.389 --> 01:11:12.665]  Well, I agree with you, and Lieberman losing, despite the hanky-panky they were pulling, trying to make sure he won, really is panicking them right now, because even with 35% of the country, with the George Bush, Diebold, Sequoia, ES&S systems, I mean, still, 35%, they still cannot steal the entire country when it's 70% against them.
[01:11:18.730 --> 01:11:29.702]  Well, as Greg Palast said recently, if they're going to steal the elections, rather than only fighting against the installation of these abominable machines, make them steal it.
[01:11:29.862 --> 01:11:30.843]  Really make them steal it.
[01:11:30.903 --> 01:11:31.624]  How do you do that?
[01:11:31.965 --> 01:11:32.826]  You turn out.
[01:11:32.926 --> 01:11:34.808]  Voters turn out in mass numbers.
[01:11:35.208 --> 01:11:37.831]  In Connecticut, the turnout, I understand, the other day was around 50%.
[01:11:38.512 --> 01:11:40.574]  Here in Georgia, with the defeat of Cynthia McKinney,
[01:11:41.081 --> 01:11:41.361]  I think so.
[01:11:54.508 --> 01:12:07.672]  But if you turn out in mass numbers, like people in other countries... If the exit poll shows that the good guy really wins by 20 points, and then magically the person that showed should be losing wins, you know there's a fraud.
[01:12:08.152 --> 01:12:09.372]  Well, absolutely.
[01:12:09.732 --> 01:12:11.653]  But that's what I think Pallas is pointing.
[01:12:11.933 --> 01:12:16.574]  Turn out in vast numbers, make these SOBs steal it and steal it big time.
[01:12:16.614 --> 01:12:18.574]  Look what they did, and I'm sure you've talked about it.
[01:12:18.594 --> 01:12:19.675]  Look what they did in Ukraine.
[01:12:19.715 --> 01:12:20.415]  Look what they did in...
[01:12:21.216 --> 01:12:21.977]  In Serbia.
[01:12:21.997 --> 01:12:28.063]  Look what they've done all over where tyrants, where despots refuse to accept the will of the people.
[01:12:28.123 --> 01:12:28.964]  The people turn out
[01:12:29.654 --> 01:12:33.276]  Relatively speaking, in huge, enormous numbers.
[01:12:33.316 --> 01:12:34.577]  Look what happened down in Mexico.
[01:12:35.037 --> 01:12:38.579]  It doesn't make any difference, I don't think, what a person's political point of view is.
[01:12:38.639 --> 01:12:49.005]  The point is, when a population feels that they're being jerked around, their electoral process is being prostituted and their vote is being stolen, they turn out in enormous numbers.
[01:12:49.045 --> 01:12:49.965]  What do we do in this country?
[01:12:50.145 --> 01:12:51.026]  We switch channels.
[01:12:52.654 --> 01:12:53.455]  Oh, that's really it.
[01:12:53.815 --> 01:12:58.538]  What about this scary new poll where 30% of Americans don't know when 9-11 happened?
[01:12:58.638 --> 01:13:01.180]  I bet you a million dollars... Oh my God, I saw that yesterday.
[01:13:01.220 --> 01:13:02.520]  I just about lost it, Alex.
[01:13:02.761 --> 01:13:04.842]  I bet... Mike, tell me this.
[01:13:05.082 --> 01:13:10.045]  Do you agree with me that 25-27% of those... I bet the majority of those people believe the official story.
[01:13:10.285 --> 01:13:18.811]  I bet those dumbbells, they said ages 40-65, that don't know when 9-11 was, even the year, I'll bet you they're George Bush supporters.
[01:13:19.171 --> 01:13:20.171]  Oh, I bet they are, too.
[01:13:20.431 --> 01:13:22.712]  What was unnerving to me, that's my age group.
[01:13:23.052 --> 01:13:41.797]  How in the hell can somebody who supposedly, in that age group, you're supposed to be kind of grounded, you're supposed to have set on some sort of worldview, how can those people not know what year this country had its greatest attack since Pearl Harbor?
[01:13:42.193 --> 01:13:44.376]  And an attack engineered by the Bush administration.
[01:13:44.456 --> 01:13:45.217]  I don't understand that.
[01:13:45.337 --> 01:13:46.598]  Yeah, this was bigger than Pearl Harbor.
[01:13:46.638 --> 01:13:49.241]  This wasn't out in the middle of the Pacific Ocean.
[01:13:49.261 --> 01:13:49.562]  That's true.
[01:13:49.602 --> 01:13:51.404]  This was in New York, capital of the world.
[01:13:51.424 --> 01:13:51.964]  So you're right.
[01:13:52.525 --> 01:13:53.746]  It's even bigger than Pearl Harbor.
[01:13:53.987 --> 01:13:54.788]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:13:55.088 --> 01:13:56.570]  Well, Mike, let's get back to 9-11.
[01:13:56.910 --> 01:14:02.016]  I really do think that the 9-11 Truth Movement is putting the heat on them, because just like the movement with...
[01:14:02.416 --> 01:14:08.297]  Well, I agree, and I think little by little, little baby steps, little tentative, like somebody sticking their toe into the water at the lake to see if it's cold enough.
[01:14:08.317 --> 01:14:10.817]  Mainstream media is starting to, if not, join in the questions about 9-11.
[01:14:32.071 --> 01:14:32.471]  We're good to go.
[01:14:47.376 --> 01:14:50.780]  It's being done in almost a squirrely kind of way.
[01:14:51.040 --> 01:14:53.263]  Well, Brian Lamb admits that, exactly.
[01:14:53.303 --> 01:14:58.068]  Brian Lamb admits he knows me, he's done shows on me, he thinks I'm dangerous, whatever.
[01:14:58.809 --> 01:15:06.977]  But why would Brian Lamb not just air our program one time, and it was the hardest-hitting thing ever on C-SPAN, but air it four times and promote it?
[01:15:07.037 --> 01:15:08.139]  And I agree, it's squirrely.
[01:15:08.239 --> 01:15:09.260]  I've talked to reporters.
[01:15:09.680 --> 01:15:09.840]  I think?
[01:15:25.883 --> 01:15:27.844]  Well, I think there's some truth to that.
[01:15:28.004 --> 01:15:47.014]  And also, I don't think it's possible to continue to maintain the facade or the charade that what happened on September 11, 2001 was the result of 15 people with box cutters defeating the most sophisticated and expensive military-industrial complex in the history of the human race.
[01:15:47.974 --> 01:15:53.497]  I just can't get my mind, Alex, around the fact that so many Americans are willing to believe that
[01:15:53.897 --> 01:15:57.560]  We were in a 50-year-long war with the Soviet Union.
[01:15:57.901 --> 01:15:59.622]  We had nukes aimed at each other.
[01:15:59.702 --> 01:16:01.063]  We had surrogate wars.
[01:16:01.103 --> 01:16:05.748]  There was all kinds of doubletry and chicanery and duplicity going on.
[01:16:06.348 --> 01:16:07.709]  But somehow we maintained.
[01:16:08.110 --> 01:16:13.354]  Now, all of a sudden, 15 people with box cutters come to this country and wreak this kind of havoc?
[01:16:13.474 --> 01:16:14.495]  No, no, I'm sorry.
[01:16:14.876 --> 01:16:17.138]  I don't know what the official... I don't know what the truth is.
[01:16:17.178 --> 01:16:20.000]  You're right to say 15, because a bunch of them have been found to still be alive.
[01:16:20.020 --> 01:16:20.781]  Well, right, right.
[01:16:21.261 --> 01:16:23.402]  But the official story, and I don't know... Well, you're right.
[01:16:23.442 --> 01:16:26.183]  What we know, Mike, is the official story is a fraud end-to-end.
[01:16:26.223 --> 01:16:28.544]  I mean, we know there were drills to confuse everybody.
[01:16:28.584 --> 01:16:30.485]  We know public officials got warned not to fly.
[01:16:30.705 --> 01:16:31.865]  We know there was insider trading.
[01:16:31.885 --> 01:16:34.987]  We know Bush had the troops already masked around Afghanistan.
[01:16:35.247 --> 01:16:37.508]  We know that the PNAC boy said we need this attack.
[01:16:37.708 --> 01:16:38.868]  I mean, how much more obvious?
[01:16:39.088 --> 01:16:45.071]  Who goes out and writes documents saying we need an attack, and then they get the attack they need, and their fingerprints are all over it?
[01:16:45.091 --> 01:16:48.532]  I mean, this is... How much hubris and hootspire are we dealing with here?
[01:16:48.752 --> 01:16:49.072]  I know.
[01:16:49.112 --> 01:16:50.393]  It's incredible.
[01:16:50.493 --> 01:17:00.557]  And I have to say, the day of those attacks, when my daughter in Florida called me and said, Dad, turn on CNN, from the day of those attacks, probably for the first six months, I was really out in the wilderness.
[01:17:00.977 --> 01:17:01.897]  The whole thing stunk.
[01:17:02.338 --> 01:17:10.301]  But it's been through the efforts of people like you, people like Tarpley, your websites, the 9-11 Truth Commission, the 9-11 Scholars for Truth,
[01:17:11.096 --> 01:17:18.280]  That really shook me to my foundation because I think, like a lot of Americans, see, I don't consider myself left or right, up or down.
[01:17:18.380 --> 01:17:20.862]  I consider myself just an average American.
[01:17:20.902 --> 01:17:22.883]  A lot of people are laughing when I say that.
[01:17:23.463 --> 01:17:25.544]  But, you know, I didn't know what to believe.
[01:17:25.765 --> 01:17:28.026]  And thank God there have been efforts.
[01:17:28.522 --> 01:17:30.202]  And I'm not trying to toot your horn, Alex.
[01:17:30.222 --> 01:17:31.543]  You don't need me to toot your horn.
[01:17:31.563 --> 01:17:39.464]  But thank God there have been people like you who have refused to just sit back and say, well, let's just accept the official story and move on.
[01:17:39.844 --> 01:17:41.024]  You have educated me.
[01:17:41.284 --> 01:17:43.265]  So have other people in the 9-11 Truth.
[01:17:43.465 --> 01:17:45.205]  You know, I didn't know anything about Building 7.
[01:17:45.625 --> 01:17:48.706]  I didn't know anything about... I didn't see those videos.
[01:17:48.826 --> 01:17:52.206]  I didn't know about the Israelis on the white van.
[01:17:52.406 --> 01:17:53.767]  You know, I didn't know any of this stuff.
[01:17:53.927 --> 01:17:54.287]  Nothing.
[01:17:54.687 --> 01:17:55.727]  Until I started...
[01:17:57.136 --> 01:18:00.802]  Getting my hands on the research was put out there by people like you.
[01:18:01.603 --> 01:18:08.052]  When the history of this is all written, you're going to be right there at the top of the people who refuse to buy the story.
[01:18:08.092 --> 01:18:09.955]  Unless we all go to FEMA camps.
[01:18:10.015 --> 01:18:11.297]  I'm not trying to toot your horn, Alex.
[01:18:12.683 --> 01:18:16.705]  I know a lot of your fans understand this about you, but thank God you were out there doing this.
[01:18:16.785 --> 01:18:17.926]  That's all I have to say about that.
[01:18:18.066 --> 01:18:21.448]  Well, Mike, listen, I want to thank you for all the stories you've broken and the work you've done.
[01:18:21.508 --> 01:18:33.094]  Listen, I just saw this monumental fraud on the order of the moon is made of cheese, and the world is flat, and pumpkins really can fly to Mars.
[01:18:33.774 --> 01:18:37.336]  The official story was a joke, and then I found Operation Northwoods.
[01:18:37.356 --> 01:18:39.657]  Oh, my God, yeah.
[01:18:39.977 --> 01:18:42.318]  I want to see, Mike Malloy, where you think this is all going.
[01:18:42.358 --> 01:18:47.340]  I mean, how you think this is going to break, what we can do to stop it, what we can do to stop World War III.
[01:18:47.620 --> 01:18:48.681]  Mike Malloy is our guest.
[01:18:48.701 --> 01:18:50.822]  You can listen to him on Air America weeknights.
[01:18:50.922 --> 01:18:51.362]  Stay with us.
[01:18:53.443 --> 01:18:55.323]  Dad, can we stop?
[01:18:55.644 --> 01:18:57.164]  We need to go to the bathroom.
[01:18:57.604 --> 01:18:57.825]  What?
[01:18:58.425 --> 01:18:58.705]  Again?
[01:18:59.480 --> 01:19:01.082]  We just stopped two hours ago.
[01:19:01.382 --> 01:19:02.603]  Honey, we better stop.
[01:19:02.803 --> 01:19:05.106]  I gave the kids their Spork Berkey water bottles.
[01:19:05.426 --> 01:19:06.707]  Why did you do that?
[01:19:06.987 --> 01:19:09.450]  Because they can't sit and talk at the same time.
[01:19:09.670 --> 01:19:12.533]  Or would you rather listen to them singing, Are we there yet?
[01:19:12.813 --> 01:19:13.834]  Are we there yet?
[01:19:13.894 --> 01:19:15.215]  for the entire trip?
[01:19:15.235 --> 01:19:17.638]  Hmm, I didn't think about that.
[01:19:18.138 --> 01:19:19.119]  Great idea.
[01:19:19.139 --> 01:19:22.002]  Yeah, and it's cheap entertainment for the kids.
[01:19:22.378 --> 01:19:24.878]  Bottled water costs around 75 cents a bottle.
[01:19:25.058 --> 01:19:29.479]  And using our Berkey Sport bottles, it costs us less than two and a half cents per refill.
[01:19:29.659 --> 01:19:31.780]  And we can purify water from the lake as well.
[01:19:32.020 --> 01:19:33.960]  Honey, you're terrific!
[01:19:34.500 --> 01:19:35.220]  I know, dear.
[01:19:35.520 --> 01:19:37.041]  Now find us a restroom.
[01:19:37.521 --> 01:19:38.401]  I need to stop, too.
[01:19:38.581 --> 01:19:43.062]  Get your Berkey Sport purification bottle for only $39 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:19:43.102 --> 01:19:43.302]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:19:43.362 --> 01:19:45.002]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[01:19:54.389 --> 01:19:55.449]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:19:55.849 --> 01:20:01.331]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[01:20:01.891 --> 01:20:02.391]  That's right.
[01:20:02.711 --> 01:20:05.592]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[01:20:06.392 --> 01:20:12.474]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[01:20:13.047 --> 01:20:20.733]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[01:20:21.173 --> 01:20:25.977]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[01:20:26.656 --> 01:20:31.678]  If you'd like to take a look at gold free retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[01:20:32.458 --> 01:20:36.599]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[01:20:36.979 --> 01:20:37.219]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:20:37.239 --> 01:20:39.180]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[01:20:39.240 --> 01:20:39.540]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:20:39.840 --> 01:20:40.120]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:20:54.082 --> 01:20:56.403]  Do you know the truth about breast cancer?
[01:20:57.424 --> 01:21:00.266]  Do you realize that the race for the cure is over?
[01:21:01.787 --> 01:21:11.432]  The best kept secret in the world today is that now it is possible to kill cancer without personal suffering, mutilation, and poisoning of your entire system.
[01:21:12.373 --> 01:21:16.155]  Now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaysMed, Inc.'
[01:21:16.115 --> 01:21:17.536]  's patented methodology.
[01:21:18.320 --> 01:21:29.147]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation, we can destroy skin cancer and breast tumors of any size without adverse side effects at a physician's office.
[01:21:29.767 --> 01:21:32.269]  Star War technology at its best.
[01:21:33.169 --> 01:21:37.412]  For more information, call 702-953-0267 or visit www.lazemedinc.com or call 702-953-0267.
[01:21:52.230 --> 01:22:00.882]  David J. Smith, did you know that a plan was laid down in the 1870s to conquer the world for world government that has not been deviated from since its inception?
[01:22:01.683 --> 01:22:06.609]  These conspirators said that they must have many revolutionary wars and three world wars.
[01:22:07.350 --> 01:22:13.332]  Have we witnessed these wars of liberation since the 1920s and then World War I and World War II?
[01:22:14.053 --> 01:22:22.556]  The Illuminati, who are worshippers of Lucifer, are now preparing for the final conflict, the Third World War, to produce their one world government.
[01:22:23.236 --> 01:22:30.859]  We'd like to help you understand how these things are coming about by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[01:22:40.783 --> 01:22:44.165]  All right, it's our final segment with Mike Malloy.
[01:22:44.465 --> 01:22:46.526]  I'm going to go through the latest...
[01:22:59.219 --> 01:23:00.200]  We're good to go.
[01:23:22.568 --> 01:23:22.868]  I think?
[01:23:42.339 --> 01:23:45.201]  I was talking to Mike during the breakfast, what he was calling him, coming to power.
[01:23:45.221 --> 01:23:46.302]  So I'm going to steal that.
[01:23:46.622 --> 01:23:48.684]  Mike, how do we defeat this?
[01:23:49.664 --> 01:23:53.047]  Number one, where do you see this going in the next few months with the October surprises?
[01:23:53.407 --> 01:23:54.408]  And then how do we stop it?
[01:23:54.448 --> 01:23:55.008]  Your ideas.
[01:23:55.349 --> 01:24:01.173]  Well, I'm leaving the realm of nervous and getting into the realm of scared.
[01:24:01.193 --> 01:24:06.657]  And whenever I get scared, I've learned a long time ago that you have to grab your emotions and settle down.
[01:24:07.727 --> 01:24:14.409]  I think that there is a definite effort to push the entire population of the planet right to the brink.
[01:24:15.389 --> 01:24:22.451]  There are a lot of philosophical types who are in control of our government now who would like to see that happen.
[01:24:22.791 --> 01:24:33.054]  There are also types in control or in positions of influence who have other agendas that would result in nuclear war or World War III.
[01:24:33.094 --> 01:24:34.254]  Here's what I think we need to do.
[01:24:34.734 --> 01:24:35.155]  We're good to go.
[01:24:55.754 --> 01:24:57.735]  We have to get ourselves educated.
[01:24:57.816 --> 01:25:04.020]  We can't continue as the most entertained population in the history of the human race and the least informed politically.
[01:25:04.080 --> 01:25:05.361]  We have to get educated.
[01:25:05.661 --> 01:25:07.903]  And the third thing, and Alex, I don't know if this is going to be...
[01:25:08.468 --> 01:25:10.188]  If you want me to say this or not.
[01:25:10.208 --> 01:25:17.970]  But I also think that people need to understand that the idea of protecting their families and protecting themselves is critical.
[01:25:19.270 --> 01:25:19.971]  I'm a rare breed.
[01:25:20.011 --> 01:25:22.551]  I'm a liberal with a gun, with several guns.
[01:25:22.631 --> 01:25:25.532]  I have a permit to carry... Oh, are you kidding, Mike Malone?
[01:25:25.632 --> 01:25:27.872]  I think everybody should be armed against this tyranny.
[01:25:28.452 --> 01:25:28.953]  Absolutely.
[01:25:29.013 --> 01:25:31.853]  I've had a permit to carry for the past 16 years here in Atlanta.
[01:25:31.973 --> 01:25:33.574]  And I don't like that.
[01:25:33.734 --> 01:25:35.634]  I wish I lived in a society or a time...
[01:25:36.124 --> 01:25:38.045]  When it wasn't necessary, but by God it is.
[01:25:38.165 --> 01:25:41.588]  So I'm suggesting that people are prepared.
[01:25:41.608 --> 01:25:45.250]  Hey, all the classic liberals I know in Austin are out buying shotguns.
[01:25:46.211 --> 01:25:49.072]  And the main thing is we can have a breakdown in society, a Great Depression.
[01:25:49.373 --> 01:25:51.894]  I mean, Bush is openly setting up a dictatorship.
[01:25:52.254 --> 01:25:53.155]  Well, that's the thing.
[01:25:53.675 --> 01:25:56.157]  I will fight to defend liberty.
[01:25:56.257 --> 01:25:56.877]  I mean liberty.
[01:25:56.957 --> 01:26:00.920]  I don't mean this hog snot that these neocons have gotten us into.
[01:26:01.260 --> 01:26:03.862]  But I will fight, and most of the people that I know will fight,
[01:26:04.202 --> 01:26:04.824]  We're good to go.
[01:26:15.819 --> 01:26:23.045]  To be very clear on that, if we are going to be a nation of sheep, then we're going to be sheared by a pack of wolves.
[01:26:24.006 --> 01:26:26.027]  Well, you just knocked it out of the park.
[01:26:26.047 --> 01:26:27.589]  I mean, that was a long run right there.
[01:26:27.889 --> 01:26:28.810]  That is really the key.
[01:26:28.850 --> 01:26:41.279]  They have to know that we know they're terrorists, that they're a bunch of wannabe dictators, and that they may be sucking the treasury dry, but that we're not going to let them roll the whole country and put troops on the streets of America.
[01:26:41.500 --> 01:26:44.382]  And if they really keep pushing it, they're going to run into a brick wall.
[01:26:44.782 --> 01:26:47.685]  Well, I don't know how to say that in a gentle way.
[01:26:48.085 --> 01:26:49.366]  That's exactly what I mean.
[01:26:50.027 --> 01:26:51.708]  And I'm dead serious about this.
[01:26:53.129 --> 01:27:08.283]  I'm not going to sit back, Alex, and allow a country that I've had family members fight for, institutions that were set up in this country that are honorable, that show respect for human dignity, I'm not going to allow that.
[01:27:08.891 --> 01:27:09.371]  We're good to go.
[01:27:22.742 --> 01:27:25.503]  And make damn good and sure that you know how to handle a firearm.
[01:27:25.603 --> 01:27:27.764]  That's all I could... What am I going to say, Alex?
[01:27:28.064 --> 01:27:28.504]  What should I say?
[01:27:28.524 --> 01:27:29.964]  Folks, it's gotten so bad.
[01:27:29.984 --> 01:27:32.045]  I love it, Mike Malloy, because that is the solution.
[01:27:32.085 --> 01:27:33.506]  You answered the question exactly right.
[01:27:33.526 --> 01:27:34.926]  I had no idea you'd come out with that.
[01:27:35.446 --> 01:27:41.008]  The answer is... I mean, folks, when we've got... And again, he's not really a liberal, but he's one of the best shows on Air America.
[01:27:41.408 --> 01:27:43.589]  I mean, Limbaugh's saying, turn your guns into Bush.
[01:27:43.649 --> 01:27:45.810]  The gun confiscation in New Orleans is good.
[01:27:45.990 --> 01:27:47.971]  And Mike Malloy is saying, buy guns.
[01:27:48.331 --> 01:27:50.511]  I mean, you know George Bush is pure scum.
[01:27:50.791 --> 01:27:52.192]  Mike Malloy, how do folks listen to you?
[01:27:53.112 --> 01:27:56.374]  Alex, I'm on every night, 9 to midnight Central Time, 10 p.m.
[01:27:56.394 --> 01:27:56.855]  to 1 a.m.
[01:27:56.975 --> 01:27:58.176]  Eastern, Monday through Friday.
[01:27:58.196 --> 01:28:03.799]  If you don't have Air America in a certain market, you can get me on the Internet or XM Satellite Radio.
[01:28:04.219 --> 01:28:04.520]  All right.
[01:28:04.540 --> 01:28:06.801]  Well, that's a reason to get XM right there to hear Mike Malloy.
[01:28:06.841 --> 01:28:08.722]  And I wish everybody on Air America was like you.
[01:28:08.802 --> 01:28:10.783]  Though I've noticed, Mike, I've been listening.
[01:28:11.004 --> 01:28:12.625]  My wife's got XM the last few months.
[01:28:12.685 --> 01:28:14.686]  I can listen here on 1600 in Austin.
[01:28:14.966 --> 01:28:17.948]  I've been noticing suddenly they're all starting to get a little bit more like Mike Malloy.
[01:28:20.176 --> 01:28:26.579]  I don't know how people who are at least halfway educated like me can't understand what's going on.
[01:28:26.599 --> 01:28:27.539]  I mean, come on, folks.
[01:28:27.659 --> 01:28:34.463]  If they're on Air America or walking the streets of Austin or somewhere in Butte, Montana, there's no difference.
[01:28:34.523 --> 01:28:35.623]  This is America.
[01:28:35.683 --> 01:28:37.524]  We're all at risk, and we better wake up to that.
[01:28:37.564 --> 01:28:37.945]  You're right.
[01:28:37.985 --> 01:28:38.705]  God bless you.
[01:28:38.925 --> 01:28:39.826]  God bless you, Mike Malloy.
[01:28:39.866 --> 01:28:40.306]  Take care.
[01:28:40.766 --> 01:28:41.486]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:43.667 --> 01:28:44.568]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.048 --> 01:28:46.549]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.563 --> 01:28:50.346]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.109 --> 01:29:01.657]  According to a recent report by the National Institute of Health, high blood pressure is a major risk factor for heart disease and the chief risk factor for stroke and heart failure.
[01:29:01.857 --> 01:29:03.699]  It affects about 50 million Americans.
[01:29:03.879 --> 01:29:05.020]  That's one in four adults.
[01:29:05.407 --> 01:29:05.928]  We're good to go.
[01:29:05.948 --> 01:29:06.148]  I think?
[01:29:22.907 --> 01:29:32.550]  Visit us online at ResearchedHerbs.com to learn more about heart care, the widely researched natural herbal supplement for regulating blood pressure and maintaining optimum heart health.
[01:29:32.870 --> 01:29:38.952]  Did you know that the safety and effectiveness of heart care is backed by over 100 clinical trials and experimental studies?
[01:29:39.352 --> 01:29:39.792]  Act now.

[01:29:46.454 --> 01:29:46.754]  That's 1-800-845-3841.
[01:29:53.507 --> 01:29:57.092]  As snow falls on the majestic Rocky Mountains, it eventually melts.
[01:29:57.292 --> 01:30:03.219]  The water east of the continental divide travels downhill over 1,600 miles before reaching the Atlantic Ocean.
[01:30:03.379 --> 01:30:08.085]  On the western side, water travels downhill almost 1,000 miles to reach the Pacific Ocean.
[01:30:08.105 --> 01:30:10.889]  As you ponder this miracle, ask yourself this question.
[01:30:11.149 --> 01:30:15.231]  How many people and animals has that water passed through before it reaches my area?
[01:30:15.691 --> 01:30:19.312]  Turkey has revolutionized the way water is purified simply, internationally.
[01:30:19.412 --> 01:30:23.514]  At the heart of these portable systems are the black turkey purification elements.
[01:30:23.674 --> 01:30:29.316]  So powerful, these elements extract pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, heavy metals, and yuck.
[01:30:29.756 --> 01:30:30.376]  We're good to go.
[01:30:52.515 --> 01:31:01.680]  Coming this August through October, the Models of Excellence series, airing on CNN and the Discovery Channel, will be featuring segments on innovative home-based business solutions.
[01:31:02.101 --> 01:31:05.663]  Many companies were considered, but only one company made the final cut.
[01:31:05.923 --> 01:31:15.768]  The company that was chosen above and beyond the rest is the same company that you've been hearing about for months here on GCN, www.DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[01:31:16.088 --> 01:31:22.192]  This home-based business has changed the lives of many people worldwide by allowing economic freedom never thought possible.
[01:31:22.312 --> 01:31:24.274]  And see for yourself what a life-changing experience this can be.
[01:31:24.294 --> 01:31:25.535]  Would you like more information right now?
[01:31:25.595 --> 01:31:28.137]  Just visit www.DidYouRobBillGates.com and learn how easy it is to start today.
[01:31:58.138 --> 01:32:00.040]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:32:00.521 --> 01:32:03.324]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:32:04.585 --> 01:32:07.148]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:32:07.989 --> 01:32:11.372]  I predicted five years and 15 days ago the U.S.
[01:32:11.413 --> 01:32:15.937]  government would attack the World Trade Center and blame it on their CIS or their son bin Laden.
[01:32:17.199 --> 01:32:19.101]  I detailed them using aircraft.
[01:32:21.152 --> 01:32:24.013]  That's how I'm able to analyze enemy operations.
[01:32:24.333 --> 01:32:26.713]  But only when I know they're going into a plan.
[01:32:27.293 --> 01:32:28.734]  And now I can see the clear signature.
[01:32:28.754 --> 01:32:34.715]  I've told you for the last three years or so, I can't tell you exactly what they're going to do because I haven't seen enough of their operations.
[01:32:35.375 --> 01:32:41.636]  Stuff can be totally secret inside the NSA, inside the private corporations that give the orders, inside the roundtable groups in London.
[01:32:42.796 --> 01:32:45.517]  But the manifestation of their operations can be witnessed
[01:32:46.295 --> 01:32:57.698]  At ground level, and when looked at on a wide spectrum across time, you can then, off those indicators, ascertain the orders almost down to the exact specifics.
[01:33:01.219 --> 01:33:03.779]  So this is the type of stuff that we're dealing with here.
[01:33:04.159 --> 01:33:05.520]  And I'm going to go over all of that.
[01:33:05.560 --> 01:33:08.320]  I'm going to go over the latest fear-mongering and this confluence.
[01:33:08.360 --> 01:33:09.220]  Now it's all going together.
[01:33:09.461 --> 01:33:10.501]  We're going to take your calls.
[01:33:10.521 --> 01:33:10.581]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:33:10.601 --> 01:33:10.661]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:33:16.872 --> 01:33:20.814]  But first, all of this dovetails with fiction.
[01:33:20.854 --> 01:33:24.035]  You see, fiction is based, in many cases, on reality.
[01:33:24.055 --> 01:33:26.496]  It isn't just reality imitating fiction.
[01:33:26.536 --> 01:33:28.597]  I think some of you may have heard this before.
[01:33:33.539 --> 01:33:34.840]  Good evening, everyone.
[01:33:35.670 --> 01:33:38.971]  Allow me first to apologize for this emergency challenge.
[01:33:39.011 --> 01:33:47.035]  I do, like many of you, appreciate the comforts of the everyday routine, the security of the familiar, the tranquility of repetition.
[01:33:47.195 --> 01:33:48.775]  I enjoy them as much as any bloke.
[01:33:49.556 --> 01:34:00.300]  But in the spirit of commemoration, whereby those important events of the past, usually associated with someone's death or the end of some awful bloody struggle, are celebrated with a nice holiday...
[01:34:01.261 --> 01:34:10.610]  I thought we could mark this, November the 5th, a day that is sadly no longer remembered, by taking some time out of our daily lives to sit down and have a little chat.
[01:34:11.330 --> 01:34:14.073]  There are, of course, those who do not want us to speak.
[01:34:14.213 --> 01:34:14.734]  Let me think.
[01:34:14.774 --> 01:34:15.274]  Just let me think.
[01:34:15.294 --> 01:34:20.899]  I suspect even now, orders are being shouted into telephones, and men with guns will soon be on their way.
[01:34:20.919 --> 01:34:22.381]  Charles, is that... Why?
[01:34:23.186 --> 01:34:29.248]  Because while the crunching may be used in lieu of conversation, words will always retain their power.
[01:34:29.768 --> 01:34:35.129]  Words are for the means to meaning, and for those who will listen, the enunciation of truth.
[01:34:35.629 --> 01:34:40.511]  And the truth is, there is something terribly wrong with this country, isn't there?
[01:34:40.571 --> 01:34:41.511]  You designed it, sir.
[01:34:41.591 --> 01:34:42.511]  You wanted it foolproof.
[01:34:42.531 --> 01:34:43.932]  You taught me every television in London.
[01:34:44.172 --> 01:34:47.573]  Cruelty and injustice, intolerance and oppression.
[01:34:48.073 --> 01:34:48.453]  And where once
[01:34:52.341 --> 01:34:59.725]  How did this happen?
[01:35:00.385 --> 01:35:01.225]  Who's to blame?
[01:35:02.186 --> 01:35:04.807]  Well, certainly there are those who are more responsible than others.
[01:35:05.167 --> 01:35:06.768]  They will be held accountable.
[01:35:07.148 --> 01:35:12.630]  But again, truth be told, if you're looking for the guilty, you need only look into a mirror.
[01:35:13.771 --> 01:35:15.532]  I know why you did it.
[01:35:15.752 --> 01:35:16.832]  I know you were afraid.
[01:35:16.852 --> 01:35:17.573]  Who would be?
[01:35:17.613 --> 01:35:17.753]  War?
[01:35:17.793 --> 01:35:17.993]  Terror?
[01:35:18.313 --> 01:35:18.853]  Disease?
[01:35:21.184 --> 01:35:26.987]  There were a myriad of problems which conspired to corrupt your reason and rob you of your common sense.
[01:35:27.628 --> 01:35:29.028]  Fear got the best of you.
[01:35:29.429 --> 01:35:33.391]  And in your panic, you turned to the now High Chancellor, Adam Sutler.
[01:35:33.991 --> 01:35:35.072]  He promised you order.
[01:35:35.112 --> 01:35:36.133]  He promised you peace.
[01:35:36.593 --> 01:35:40.195]  And all he demanded in return was your silent, obedient consent.
[01:35:40.275 --> 01:35:41.476]  Inspector, you're almost through.
[01:35:41.636 --> 01:35:43.777]  Last night, I sought to end that silence.
[01:35:44.457 --> 01:35:49.180]  Last night, I destroyed the old Bailey to remind this country of what it has forgotten.
[01:35:51.058 --> 01:35:57.540]  More than 400 years ago, a great citizen wished to embed the 5th of November forever in our memory.
[01:35:57.560 --> 01:36:02.401]  His hope was to remind the world that fairness, justice, and freedom are more than words.
[01:36:03.142 --> 01:36:04.482]  They are perspectives.
[01:36:05.362 --> 01:36:14.885]  So if you've seen nothing, if the crimes of this government remain unknown to you, then I would suggest that you allow the 5th of November to pass unmarked.
[01:36:15.685 --> 01:36:19.407]  All right, and then later in the film, as things are imploding, the police learn...
[01:36:44.895 --> 01:36:45.695]  Or they're discussing.
[01:36:45.735 --> 01:36:46.316]  What did they learn?
[01:36:46.616 --> 01:36:51.477]  That the government launched a bio-attack to bring in martial law before.
[01:36:51.497 --> 01:36:55.419]  And, of course, then they also owned the company that sold the cure.
[01:36:55.439 --> 01:37:03.201]  Rumsfeld with both the anthrax and now the Tamiflu for the bird flu.
[01:37:03.381 --> 01:37:06.002]  Billions, personally, each time.
[01:37:06.022 --> 01:37:11.304]  And the government also stages bombings and terror attacks themselves in the film.
[01:37:12.017 --> 01:37:19.601]  I don't really like the fact that then, you know, the V stages the attacks against them, but it's done to get attention to then point out that they carried out the attacks.
[01:37:20.362 --> 01:37:25.385]  The point is that this next little clip really does spell it out.
[01:37:25.405 --> 01:37:27.266]  This is what the Chancellor is telling his top people.
[01:37:28.504 --> 01:37:32.365]  That he wants to scare the public and show them how much they need the government.
[01:37:32.706 --> 01:37:39.628]  So he gives the order, and then it cuts to the newscast the next day of terrorism, floods, destruction, only the government can save you.
[01:37:39.888 --> 01:37:52.992]  And that's what you're seeing right now with all these terror alerts and all these busts, which will be all over the news in a week from now, two days from now it'll come out, it's all staged, but that'll be the back of the paper, and the general public who doesn't even know what year it is, most people don't know who the vice president is,
[01:37:53.052 --> 01:37:53.572]  We're good to go.
[01:37:53.592 --> 01:37:53.792]  I think?
[01:38:14.361 --> 01:38:17.664]  And now I'm telling you they're about to start World War III!
[01:38:17.945 --> 01:38:21.128]  And they're about to carry out terror attacks here to legitimize it!
[01:38:21.288 --> 01:38:23.290]  Now what are we going to do about it?
[01:38:23.490 --> 01:38:24.371]  Roll the next clip!
[01:38:25.012 --> 01:38:32.459]  Chancellor, I know no one seems to want to discuss this, but if we're to be prepared for any eventuality, then it can't be ignored any longer.
[01:38:33.849 --> 01:38:38.111]  The red report in front of you has been vetted by several demolition specialists.
[01:38:38.431 --> 01:38:45.255]  Now, it concludes that the most logical delivery system for the terrorists to use would be an airborne attack.
[01:38:46.175 --> 01:38:53.138]  A separate report has been filed suggesting a train, despite the fact that the tunnels surrounding Parliament have been sealed shut.
[01:38:53.759 --> 01:38:55.300]  Who filed that report?
[01:38:57.060 --> 01:38:58.041]  Chief Inspector Finch.
[01:38:58.401 --> 01:39:01.322]  Do you have any evidence to support this conclusion, Mr Finch?
[01:39:01.943 --> 01:39:02.283]  No, sir.
[01:39:03.191 --> 01:39:03.711]  Just a feeling.
[01:39:04.391 --> 01:39:10.034]  If I am sure of anything, Inspector Finch, it is that this government will not survive if it is to be subject to your feelings.
[01:39:11.074 --> 01:39:16.356]  Mr. Dascombe, what we need right now is a clear message to the people of this country.
[01:39:17.193 --> 01:39:22.117]  This message must be read in every newspaper, heard on every radio, seen on every television.
[01:39:22.657 --> 01:39:26.199]  This message must resound throughout the entire interlink.
[01:39:26.840 --> 01:39:29.902]  I want this country to realize that we stand on the edge of oblivion.
[01:39:30.222 --> 01:39:34.305]  I want every man, woman, and child to understand how close we are to chaos.
[01:39:34.965 --> 01:39:39.689]  I want everyone to remember why they need us.
[01:39:40.529 --> 01:39:45.112]  In the former United States, civil war continues to devastate the Midwest.
[01:39:45.253 --> 01:39:49.416]  Scientists attribute this latest water shortage to the lack of rainfall the last two years.
[01:39:50.016 --> 01:39:52.958]  Ministry officials expect water coupon prices to rise.
[01:39:53.018 --> 01:39:55.000]  Police have arrested nine suspects.
[01:39:55.060 --> 01:39:58.162]  Can you believe this?
[01:39:58.302 --> 01:40:02.505]  Outside the quarantine zone, a new airborne pathogen has killed 27 people.
[01:40:03.106 --> 01:40:07.029]  Authorities have uncovered new evidence linking the terrorist organization called VEE.
[01:40:13.656 --> 01:40:15.898]  Ah, yes, the terrorist is behind the St.
[01:40:15.918 --> 01:40:17.620]  Mary's bio-attack.
[01:40:19.623 --> 01:40:23.507]  14 years before, but V was actually a victim of that government attack.
[01:40:25.309 --> 01:40:27.411]  And so now we see art imitating life.
[01:40:27.852 --> 01:40:28.893]  In reality...
[01:40:30.413 --> 01:40:40.557]  All of these threats of bioattacks are just to get us into the compact cities and get us under the martial law control so then they can have the real bioattacks and have an orderly extermination.
[01:40:41.317 --> 01:40:43.618]  But that comes down the road.
[01:40:44.479 --> 01:40:58.264]  Right now what we face is the fact that the globalists, the crime syndicate, is stirring up a war in the Middle East and openly calling it World War III as if that's the best thing since mother's milk and sliced bread.
[01:40:59.326 --> 01:41:11.614]  And telling us that Hezbollah and Hamas are about to blow up the U.S., and we're at red-level alert in the airports, and we've got troops that are going to search your five-year-olds while the border stays wide open.
[01:41:11.854 --> 01:41:12.715]  What a joke!
[01:41:13.195 --> 01:41:29.006]  Building up to some giant attack that will trigger the pretext for World War III, national drafts, total martial law, your 18-year-old sons and daughters marching off to fight and die in guerrilla wars in Syria, in Iran,
[01:41:30.147 --> 01:41:34.629]  And even North Korea and areas of the former Soviet Eastern Bloc republics.
[01:41:34.909 --> 01:41:35.990]  And right here in the U.S.
[01:41:36.030 --> 01:41:37.151]  it's going to be a police state.
[01:41:37.371 --> 01:41:49.698]  You'll have lots of phony conservatives who get to keep their guns stomping around in their little citizen military outfits and all the bootlickers and phony conservatives are going to love it!
[01:41:50.814 --> 01:41:53.717]  Can you imagine getting put in a room with about ten neocons?
[01:41:54.018 --> 01:41:55.079]  You're handcuffed to a chair.
[01:41:55.099 --> 01:41:57.321]  Can you imagine how they're going to beat patriots to death?
[01:41:57.341 --> 01:41:58.783]  How they're going to get off on it?
[01:41:58.843 --> 01:42:00.305]  A bunch of pigs!
[01:42:00.665 --> 01:42:03.348]  A bunch of stinking rat garbage!
[01:42:03.729 --> 01:42:04.730]  You filth!
[01:42:05.170 --> 01:42:07.333]  This country's almost dead right now!
[01:42:07.553 --> 01:42:08.534]  You scum!
[01:42:10.712 --> 01:42:11.913]  Let me tell you why I'm so mad.
[01:42:12.313 --> 01:42:16.876]  I was on talk radio last night with these... Words can't describe them.
[01:42:16.976 --> 01:42:18.997]  These fake macho men.
[01:42:19.237 --> 01:42:23.299]  These men who act like they're men who are soft cowards!
[01:42:25.601 --> 01:42:27.201]  Not so coward, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:42:27.221 --> 01:42:31.644]  These people that act like they're tough but coddle the system and make any excuse they can.
[01:42:31.684 --> 01:42:35.186]  This guy has some show like Gunny Twit or something like that.
[01:42:35.366 --> 01:42:40.089]  His whole show is about how he's this conservative former Marine Gunny Sergeant.
[01:42:40.669 --> 01:42:44.111]  And I'm on his show, and I go, well, Operation Northwoods is an official U.S.
[01:42:44.131 --> 01:42:44.571]  government plan.
[01:42:44.751 --> 01:42:45.391]  Oh, what plan?
[01:42:45.411 --> 01:42:45.991]  Where is this?
[01:42:46.191 --> 01:42:46.972]  Oh, you can't show it.
[01:42:47.172 --> 01:42:47.852]  He wouldn't let me talk.
[01:42:47.892 --> 01:42:49.173]  I'd go, well, of course it's real.
[01:42:49.413 --> 01:42:50.533]  Oh, you claim it's real.
[01:42:50.933 --> 01:42:52.694]  And I said, well, you're into being a Marine.
[01:42:53.354 --> 01:42:54.475]  The plan was to kill U.S.
[01:42:54.495 --> 01:42:56.936]  Marines and blame them on foreign governments.
[01:42:57.016 --> 01:42:58.257]  Oh, sure it was.
[01:42:58.517 --> 01:43:01.278]  You know, just on and on.
[01:43:01.398 --> 01:43:04.559]  And show me one fact that 9-11 would be the government.
[01:43:04.739 --> 01:43:06.200]  And he wouldn't let me ever say anything.
[01:43:06.866 --> 01:43:10.527]  And I'd say, well, you know, Bush... Okay, I said, you claim you're a conservative.
[01:43:11.307 --> 01:43:13.568]  I said, Bush is double the size of the BATF.
[01:43:13.628 --> 01:43:14.708]  Oh, you say that?
[01:43:14.868 --> 01:43:15.488]  Where's your proof?
[01:43:15.508 --> 01:43:17.929]  Well, it's actually... Uh-huh, uh-huh, you don't have it, do you?
[01:43:18.429 --> 01:43:19.049]  Wouldn't let me talk.
[01:43:19.069 --> 01:43:26.411]  I go, well, Congressman Bob Barr is an NRA board member, former congressman, and he came on and said Bush has been... and admitted Bush has been more anti-gun than Clinton.
[01:43:26.811 --> 01:43:28.131]  Oh, he admitted for the president.
[01:43:28.351 --> 01:43:29.912]  Now you make up stuff Bob Barr said.
[01:43:29.932 --> 01:43:31.492]  You know, it was just... it was just...
[01:43:32.012 --> 01:43:34.673]  I was like, look, you don't know Bush is anti-gun?
[01:43:35.013 --> 01:43:36.254]  You don't know about all the raids?
[01:43:36.274 --> 01:43:37.974]  You don't know about all the shutdowns?
[01:43:37.994 --> 01:43:40.455]  You don't know about how they're using regulations, not laws?
[01:43:40.495 --> 01:43:42.916]  How he tried to get the assaultments ban reauthorized?
[01:43:42.936 --> 01:43:44.097]  You don't know about New Orleans?
[01:43:44.757 --> 01:43:45.557]  You don't know about it?
[01:43:45.838 --> 01:43:47.818]  And he just talked over me.
[01:43:48.339 --> 01:43:49.179]  They don't care?
[01:43:49.199 --> 01:43:51.740]  He made fun of me about the American Union?
[01:43:53.007 --> 01:43:53.788]  That's who they are.
[01:43:53.808 --> 01:43:57.691]  They're just these little... Everything to them, it's an act.
[01:43:57.911 --> 01:43:59.652]  Most people are posers, I've learned.
[01:43:59.953 --> 01:44:00.793]  They're not real.
[01:44:00.893 --> 01:44:12.643]  It's all about acting like you're a conservative, being into that genre, into that culture, feeling good about yourselves, giggling about the liberals, and swaggering around.
[01:44:14.304 --> 01:44:17.047]  You bring up to them, Hey, Bush has spent more money than all presidents combined.
[01:44:17.327 --> 01:44:18.548]  No, he hasn't, liar!
[01:44:19.628 --> 01:44:21.449]  Public officials were warned not to fly.
[01:44:21.469 --> 01:44:22.730]  Oh, give me names.
[01:44:23.010 --> 01:44:23.951]  Start trying to give them names.
[01:44:24.111 --> 01:44:25.432]  Oh, blah, blah, blah.
[01:44:25.472 --> 01:44:27.353]  You know, just, what are you getting so mad about?
[01:44:27.373 --> 01:44:29.134]  Oh, Alex, you're getting upset.
[01:44:29.174 --> 01:44:29.654]  What's wrong?
[01:44:29.834 --> 01:44:33.036]  I'm upset because you cowards have destroyed this country!
[01:44:33.056 --> 01:44:36.858]  I'm upset because it's all gone already!
[01:44:36.878 --> 01:44:40.200]  I'm upset because you're such trash!
[01:44:41.081 --> 01:44:42.542]  You're so cowardly!
[01:44:44.040 --> 01:44:45.001]  I look at my family.
[01:44:45.041 --> 01:44:46.742]  I look at the life I want to live.
[01:44:46.842 --> 01:44:48.043]  I don't want to be doing this.
[01:44:48.343 --> 01:44:50.505]  I wish I didn't have to do this.
[01:44:51.065 --> 01:44:53.567]  I wish I didn't have to go down the road I've got to follow.
[01:44:53.947 --> 01:44:56.549]  I wish I didn't know what these people were doing sometimes.
[01:44:56.869 --> 01:45:01.812]  But I just can't understand people who are willfully so stupid.
[01:45:03.213 --> 01:45:04.374]  Listen, it's not hype.
[01:45:05.014 --> 01:45:07.536]  They're actually getting rid of the country right now.
[01:45:08.977 --> 01:45:10.438]  See, you don't really love America.
[01:45:10.718 --> 01:45:12.860]  It's more like just some nostalgic little...
[01:45:13.613 --> 01:45:17.734]  Little grimacing thing you're into that you burble about.
[01:45:17.894 --> 01:45:20.735]  You people, you're not men.
[01:45:20.755 --> 01:45:23.176]  I'm just here to tell you this.
[01:45:24.896 --> 01:45:27.477]  I'm so tired of these people.
[01:45:30.098 --> 01:45:32.199]  Again, they think they're part of the system.
[01:45:32.219 --> 01:45:34.279]  They think they're part of the government.
[01:45:34.859 --> 01:45:38.921]  They always say, well, that's impossible because I was part of the government and we're not like that.
[01:45:39.141 --> 01:45:43.102]  You were compartmentalized, you naive little boy.
[01:45:46.092 --> 01:45:47.193]  You're a coward!
[01:45:48.734 --> 01:45:49.694]  You know the truth.
[01:45:50.014 --> 01:45:52.036]  You've decided to buy into it.
[01:45:52.356 --> 01:46:00.241]  I mean, look, anybody who's got a talk radio show every night on a major station knows that Bush is anti-gun.
[01:46:00.681 --> 01:46:04.063]  Knows that he went after the assault weapons ban and tried to reauthorize it.
[01:46:04.444 --> 01:46:05.884]  Knows he's getting rid of the borders.
[01:46:06.385 --> 01:46:10.908]  But I hear these lying neocons every day on the radio spinning it!
[01:46:12.088 --> 01:46:12.729]  Spinning it!
[01:46:13.789 --> 01:46:14.510]  And out again!
[01:46:15.362 --> 01:46:19.647]  We're going to have a bunch more Americans die.
[01:46:19.787 --> 01:46:22.149]  I'm going to have to sit there and watch them die.
[01:46:22.470 --> 01:46:35.763]  You're going to have to watch them die, or a bunch of dead Brits, and then those murdering terrorists will be suppressing smiles, clenching their lips together, up on stages being worshipped, and approval ratings spiking and all that.
[01:46:35.824 --> 01:46:37.966]  I mean, it's too much for me to handle!
[01:46:39.179 --> 01:46:42.281]  I'm sick of watching psychopathic killers.
[01:46:42.881 --> 01:46:49.564]  I mean, imagine if Ted Bundy, I've used this analogy before, who loved to bite chunks out of women and torture them and stab them and rape them and all this.
[01:46:49.904 --> 01:47:00.229]  Imagine if it was known he'd done it and then he was some kind of hero and people were worshipping him for fighting serial killers when it was known by the majority of the world they are the serial killers.
[01:47:01.650 --> 01:47:06.333]  Can you imagine what it's like for the Arabs and Europeans who the vast majority know it's an inside job?
[01:47:06.373 --> 01:47:07.694]  Not because they hate America.
[01:47:07.734 --> 01:47:10.736]  They used to love America before we turned into this empire.
[01:47:12.538 --> 01:47:13.198]  And they're over there.
[01:47:13.218 --> 01:47:14.079]  Can you imagine the horror?
[01:47:14.099 --> 01:47:15.180]  They're in the horror I'm in.
[01:47:15.240 --> 01:47:16.641]  It's horrifying.
[01:47:17.301 --> 01:47:22.645]  Mike Malloy, the big top liberal talk show host from Air America, says, buy guns?
[01:47:23.566 --> 01:47:27.128]  All the liberals I know are buying guns because they're not liberals anymore.
[01:47:27.328 --> 01:47:28.809]  They shifted paradigm.
[01:47:29.570 --> 01:47:31.151]  George Bush did it for them.
[01:47:33.115 --> 01:47:38.738]  And watching Hillary and Clinton hang around with them and sit in their laps and all the rest of them, I mean, it's just sick.
[01:47:41.100 --> 01:47:43.681]  So, and again, I don't want to hear, oh, you shouldn't get so upset.
[01:47:43.721 --> 01:47:47.103]  You shouldn't get on the air and yell and scream, Alex.
[01:47:47.483 --> 01:47:48.804]  You shouldn't be so upset.
[01:47:49.384 --> 01:47:53.947]  You know, hey, no, we should be upset about this.
[01:47:55.308 --> 01:48:00.751]  I mean, I spend, you know, all my time researching this stuff, and I sit there calmly researching it, and then I get on air saying,
[01:48:01.713 --> 01:48:03.716]  I've got to focus on the big picture, and it's upsetting.
[01:48:04.898 --> 01:48:08.322]  Again, for those that just joined us, they have staged this latest bust.
[01:48:08.743 --> 01:48:11.486]  Now you can't go on planes with drinks in this country.
[01:48:11.707 --> 01:48:13.689]  They're talking about totally restricting carry-ons here.
[01:48:13.990 --> 01:48:15.412]  They have everything but your passport.
[01:48:16.332 --> 01:48:38.682]  In England, totally searching everyone, training us how to be slaves, red alert here domestically, this leading up to all the other fake busts where they go to an innocent person's house and shoot them, and then a week later a minute was all staged in Canada and Miami, and it's the same story all leading up to, oh, we stopped most of the terror attacks, but we couldn't stop the latest one, and now we've got to attack Iran because there's evidence there behind it.
[01:48:39.904 --> 01:48:40.944]  And we're off to the races.
[01:48:41.244 --> 01:48:53.386]  Martial law, national draft, with the big terror attack, they will dump the stock market at that time by design, they will plunge the dollar even more, gas prices will go up to, it could be $6 a gallon if there's a major event.
[01:48:54.347 --> 01:48:57.107]  I mean, this is just, it's just total insanity.
[01:48:58.067 --> 01:49:06.169]  And you've got cops driving around, listen, right now, all over the U.S., who are just like the general public, 30% of them don't know when 9-11 happened.
[01:49:06.269 --> 01:49:07.309]  The year, they don't know.
[01:49:08.510 --> 01:49:10.171]  It's not that cops particularly are dumb.
[01:49:10.211 --> 01:49:11.571]  It's just they're just like the general public.
[01:49:12.091 --> 01:49:14.472]  Most of them are just totally, not even dumb.
[01:49:14.512 --> 01:49:16.753]  They're experts on their girlfriend.
[01:49:16.773 --> 01:49:18.033]  They're experts on acting cool.
[01:49:18.053 --> 01:49:21.574]  They're experts on what they want to buy at the fishing store.
[01:49:21.594 --> 01:49:23.555]  And they just know that's that crazy guy.
[01:49:23.595 --> 01:49:26.616]  Hey, you just have looked at what I've seen, okay, brother?
[01:49:27.376 --> 01:49:30.617]  And I'm telling you, everything I'm telling you is in your best interest.
[01:49:30.697 --> 01:49:31.338]  I'm your friend.
[01:49:31.598 --> 01:49:32.738]  I know what I'm talking about.
[01:49:33.018 --> 01:49:33.959]  I've done the research.
[01:49:34.119 --> 01:49:35.359]  And believe me, this stuff's real.
[01:49:36.379 --> 01:49:38.020]  This stuff's real as it gets.
[01:49:39.105 --> 01:49:42.149]  And wishing it all away won't help you.
[01:49:43.130 --> 01:49:46.955]  We've all got to stand up right now and say we know 9-11's an inside job.
[01:49:47.396 --> 01:49:49.178]  Even if it's to your spouse in bed tonight.
[01:49:49.698 --> 01:49:51.240]  You've got to tell everybody you know now!
[01:49:55.570 --> 01:49:58.752]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[01:49:59.073 --> 01:50:00.994]  My new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:50:01.374 --> 01:50:09.060]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:50:09.740 --> 01:50:16.785]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:50:17.185 --> 01:50:20.107]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran.
[01:50:20.508 --> 01:50:22.829]  A White House program to disseminate fake news.
[01:50:23.249 --> 01:50:24.070]  NSA spies.
[01:50:24.542 --> 01:50:28.605]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:50:28.905 --> 01:50:32.388]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:50:32.888 --> 01:50:34.790]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:50:35.130 --> 01:50:39.053]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:51:14.207 --> 01:51:20.709]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[01:51:20.889 --> 01:51:25.970]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[01:51:26.090 --> 01:51:34.953]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[01:51:35.233 --> 01:51:42.155]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5 by calling New Millennium at 888-

[01:52:54.232 --> 01:52:54.792]  It's simple.
[01:52:55.912 --> 01:52:58.593]  Throughout history, criminal elites have sought to enslave.
[01:52:58.613 --> 01:53:04.954]  Their populations capture them as engines of war to dominate the neighbors and move the criminal enterprise forward.
[01:53:05.928 --> 01:53:06.469]  We're good to go.
[01:53:29.756 --> 01:53:32.817]  Everything's being staged right now and continue to take your calls.
[01:53:33.397 --> 01:53:35.558]  Let's talk to Joe in Wisconsin.
[01:53:35.578 --> 01:53:36.678]  Thanks for holding it on the air.
[01:53:36.698 --> 01:53:38.179]  Hey, Alex.
[01:53:38.519 --> 01:53:42.000]  I'd like to think of you as our quartermaster for our Infowars Army.
[01:53:42.100 --> 01:53:45.842]  So just stay frosty and hang in there.
[01:53:46.302 --> 01:53:47.062]  We're all fighting it.
[01:53:47.665 --> 01:53:54.088]  What do you think about my analysis that I really think we're going to see a major terror attack in the next two months, unless we totally expose it right now?
[01:53:54.489 --> 01:53:58.351]  Well, I was going to call in and say, hey, I think we just kicked off World War III.
[01:53:58.371 --> 01:53:59.171]  I told my friend that.
[01:53:59.211 --> 01:54:01.792]  It's like, hey, I'm going to make the announcement, and you beat me to it.
[01:54:02.173 --> 01:54:04.794]  And then your guest, he mentioned the same thing.
[01:54:04.814 --> 01:54:08.716]  But I did catch Bush's speech right before your program.
[01:54:09.481 --> 01:54:10.962]  And he made some slip-ups.
[01:54:11.002 --> 01:54:14.002]  He said the government of Tony Blair he was grateful for.
[01:54:14.022 --> 01:54:14.983]  I was like, wait a minute.
[01:54:15.243 --> 01:54:16.623]  That's not Tony Blair.
[01:54:16.823 --> 01:54:17.964]  That's not his government.
[01:54:18.484 --> 01:54:23.105]  So I think it's a sign that they either don't care or they're getting really frantic.
[01:54:24.045 --> 01:54:27.006]  And they're going to try to connect it with Iran.
[01:54:27.346 --> 01:54:27.787]  I know it.
[01:54:28.527 --> 01:54:31.688]  And the local talk... Well, that's a good point.
[01:54:31.728 --> 01:54:34.749]  They don't even need to stage a tax, though they're probably going to do it.
[01:54:34.769 --> 01:54:36.369]  In fact, it's a foregone conclusion.
[01:54:36.389 --> 01:54:38.730]  They can just claim Iran was behind this.
[01:54:39.192 --> 01:54:44.840]  Well, I think what they're going to do is they're going to try to whip everybody up into a frenzy because they don't have public support for it.
[01:54:45.280 --> 01:54:46.362]  And you are right.
[01:54:46.782 --> 01:54:48.224]  Everybody, get out there.
[01:54:48.485 --> 01:54:49.506]  Tell your neighbor.
[01:54:49.546 --> 01:54:50.427]  Tell your boss.
[01:54:50.608 --> 01:54:55.955]  They may think you're nuts, but they're going to try to push for this thing as hard as they can.
[01:54:56.474 --> 01:55:01.077]  And the only way it's not going to go forward is if everybody says, look, enough is enough.
[01:55:01.197 --> 01:55:01.918]  This is nuts.
[01:55:02.298 --> 01:55:06.020]  Well, they need an external war to dominate us here domestically.
[01:55:06.221 --> 01:55:08.962]  The real target of hitting Iran is the U.S.
[01:55:09.643 --> 01:55:10.964]  It's going to get bad here, brother.
[01:55:11.884 --> 01:55:22.391]  Well, the spin that Bush was saying, even if you listen to it, but listen to it from a different perspective, ask your friends to re-listen to that speech he just gave as he got off the plane.
[01:55:22.471 --> 01:55:23.732]  It makes more sense.
[01:55:24.313 --> 01:55:26.074]  It is more truthful.
[01:55:26.716 --> 01:55:33.487]  If you think of him scripted as a terrorist insider bragging about it, because he will tell you exactly what's happening.
[01:55:33.988 --> 01:55:37.914]  He knows, and he's just letting you know what's going to happen.
[01:55:38.014 --> 01:55:39.456]  Remember the Pentagon speech?
[01:55:39.516 --> 01:55:40.358]  It's in Road to Tyranny.
[01:55:40.925 --> 01:55:44.487]  Where he says a dark cult of evil runs everything, they're unstoppable?
[01:55:44.707 --> 01:55:45.727]  Oh yeah, how does he know?
[01:55:45.827 --> 01:55:46.328]  Exactly.
[01:55:46.348 --> 01:55:49.029]  I mean, again, he's part of Skull and Bones, Bohemian Grove.
[01:55:49.069 --> 01:55:52.971]  I mean, a president talking about dark cults of evil that feed off human suffering?
[01:55:53.311 --> 01:55:55.872]  Then they said the terrorists attacked us because they hated our liberty.
[01:55:56.272 --> 01:55:59.694]  Well, we know they are the terrorists, and they're doing this to get our liberty.
[01:55:59.714 --> 01:56:01.695]  I mean, you're right.
[01:56:01.875 --> 01:56:03.016]  It's a big joke to them.
[01:56:03.356 --> 01:56:07.738]  The best thing I've found for somebody who doesn't want to believe, you just say, okay.
[01:56:08.271 --> 01:56:08.671]  One thing.
[01:56:08.991 --> 01:56:10.872]  If you're right, what's the problem?
[01:56:11.052 --> 01:56:12.512]  We all go home, nothing happens.
[01:56:12.932 --> 01:56:17.353]  But if I'm right, we, we, you and I, we've got a problem.
[01:56:17.573 --> 01:56:19.954]  Well, I mean, what do people think when they hear us talk about tyranny?
[01:56:20.254 --> 01:56:22.694]  Tyranny is in place so they can take your bank account.
[01:56:23.155 --> 01:56:25.535]  Tyranny is so they can take your money, take your stocks.
[01:56:25.915 --> 01:56:28.956]  Tyranny is so they can loot the treasury completely.
[01:56:29.436 --> 01:56:31.077]  Tyranny is so they can get rid of the borders.
[01:56:31.377 --> 01:56:32.917]  Tyranny is so they can kill this country.
[01:56:33.484 --> 01:56:35.666]  I think they get caught, Bill, when they have to ad lib.
[01:56:35.786 --> 01:56:43.172]  I think that's why it's important that we take a look again at what Bush said, because he's coming right out and saying that this is Tony Blair's government.
[01:56:43.192 --> 01:56:48.997]  It's like, wait a minute, does that mean that we are the government by, of, and for Bush?
[01:56:49.577 --> 01:56:51.539]  I hear you, and I appreciate your call.
[01:56:51.559 --> 01:56:57.524]  We're going to get a press release out on this, as we did back in 2001.
[01:56:59.365 --> 01:57:00.426]  We need to warn everybody.
[01:57:01.474 --> 01:57:02.354]  We need to get aggressive.
[01:57:02.454 --> 01:57:03.855]  We need to call everybody.
[01:57:03.875 --> 01:57:08.376]  The 9-11 truth's going to turn the heat up 10,000-fold.
[01:57:09.557 --> 01:57:11.897]  We can stop them from launching attacks.
[01:57:12.678 --> 01:57:15.118]  It can be done if you'll do it.
[01:57:16.919 --> 01:57:25.402]  Instead of calling the White House and Congress telling them not to carry out the attack, call every talk radio station in the country and keep calling and call every day and don't stop.
[01:57:26.422 --> 01:57:27.962]  All right, we'll be right back with the third hour.
[01:57:28.022 --> 01:57:29.283]  More calls and a guest.
[01:57:29.303 --> 01:57:29.663]  Stay with us.
[01:57:32.523 --> 01:57:36.747]  Order a copy of this show for your friends and family at GCNlive.com or call 877-300-7645.
[01:57:36.787 --> 01:57:37.207]  Big Brother.
[01:57:37.367 --> 01:57:37.988]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:38.148 --> 01:57:41.551]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:44.473 --> 01:57:46.555]  You want answers?
[01:57:46.855 --> 01:57:48.717]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:56.574 --> 01:58:00.295]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:00.755 --> 01:58:04.856]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:08.177 --> 01:58:16.479]  Every indicator is the globalists are moving to start World War III to carry out terror attacks here domestically and blame them on Iran.
[01:58:18.039 --> 01:58:22.240]  You can be sure they claim that these guys are connected to Iran, that they've grabbed in England, that it's guaranteed.
[01:58:23.371 --> 01:58:23.751]  Let's talk to...
[01:58:49.947 --> 01:58:50.968]  James in New York.
[01:58:51.288 --> 01:58:52.189]  You're on the air, James.
[01:58:52.229 --> 01:58:52.629]  Go ahead.
[01:58:52.649 --> 01:58:53.650]  How you doing, Alex?
[01:58:53.670 --> 01:58:53.930]  Good, sir.
[01:58:53.950 --> 01:59:00.675]  Hi, I just wanted to tell you, I hope you're wrong, but unfortunately it's true that all this stuff is going on with World War III and everything.
[01:59:02.776 --> 01:59:04.997]  It's not like I make predictions very often.
[01:59:05.198 --> 01:59:11.842]  Five years ago, five years, 15 days ago, I predicted the 9-11 attacks with precision.
[01:59:12.202 --> 01:59:15.185]  And I'm telling you right now, they're moving ahead with major attacks right now.
[01:59:15.845 --> 01:59:17.226]  Something big is going to happen soon.
[01:59:18.058 --> 01:59:18.719]  Very, very soon.
[01:59:19.401 --> 01:59:20.783]  If we don't go, absolutely not.
[01:59:21.104 --> 01:59:21.365]  Exactly.
[01:59:21.385 --> 01:59:24.431]  We have to be careful with this because I don't know what's going to happen.
[01:59:24.451 --> 01:59:28.660]  I'm thinking maybe nuclear, not, I mean, full-scale nuclear, not maybe biological.
[01:59:29.997 --> 01:59:36.360]  Maybe on a scale of maybe... Well, I've got to watch more of their activities, because they like to tell about it before they do it.
[01:59:37.701 --> 01:59:41.522]  But last time I said they'll probably attack the World Trade Centers, their asset bin Laden will take the blame.
[01:59:41.542 --> 01:59:46.704]  It'll probably involve Northwoods-type operations with airplanes, hijacking them by remote control, blowing them up.
[01:59:47.145 --> 01:59:48.265]  That was in my quotes.
[01:59:48.645 --> 01:59:50.926]  And I said, call the White House, tell them don't carry it out.
[01:59:51.026 --> 01:59:54.868]  Because I saw all the pieces going together, repeating for new listeners.
[01:59:55.468 --> 02:00:01.931]  I'm seeing that same pattern again here, this time to blame attacks on Iran that will be staged here domestically.
[02:00:02.892 --> 02:00:03.092]  Right.
[02:00:06.154 --> 02:00:09.355]  We have to call in almost every day, especially Sean Hannity.
[02:00:10.416 --> 02:00:10.616]  Yes.
[02:00:10.696 --> 02:00:12.937]  Especially him, because he's probably a demon.
[02:00:15.038 --> 02:00:17.039]  He is a demon, yes.
[02:00:17.099 --> 02:00:17.900]  He really is a demon.
[02:00:18.380 --> 02:00:18.520]  Yes.
[02:00:19.381 --> 02:00:20.662]  All right, I appreciate your call, sir.
[02:00:21.062 --> 02:00:25.866]  I mean, that fake little nice guy next door, that good boy fake act, that guy's a monster.
[02:00:27.047 --> 02:00:34.733]  That guy, again, I call them liberals because that burns little neocon toadies out there who just, ugh, you're so sick.
[02:00:35.753 --> 02:00:38.856]  I mean, you think that fake stuff is conservative?
[02:00:39.736 --> 02:00:43.659]  They're Judas goats meant to pacify you and sell you out.
[02:00:45.160 --> 02:00:45.821]  They're scum.
[02:00:47.443 --> 02:00:49.984]  Let's go ahead and... I mean, I'm mad, folks.
[02:00:50.044 --> 02:00:51.285]  The country's going down.
[02:00:52.686 --> 02:00:55.567]  Let's go ahead and take a call from Mark in Wisconsin.
[02:00:55.587 --> 02:00:56.228]  Mark, go ahead.
[02:00:57.148 --> 02:00:57.528]  Hi, Alex.
[02:00:58.029 --> 02:00:58.329]  Hello.
[02:00:58.989 --> 02:01:01.250]  I'm the one that called Wisconsin Public Radio on Monday.
[02:01:01.971 --> 02:01:02.271]  Yes, sir.
[02:01:02.691 --> 02:01:04.852]  They recited your July 25, 2001 thing.
[02:01:05.813 --> 02:01:09.294]  Yes, my warning of July 25, 2001, yeah.
[02:01:09.555 --> 02:01:10.715]  And I couldn't sleep that night.
[02:01:11.015 --> 02:01:13.637]  I was rolling around like you do when your subconscious is working on you.
[02:01:15.418 --> 02:01:15.518]  And...
[02:01:16.365 --> 02:01:18.907]  People are in denial, you know, and they don't want to do nothing.
[02:01:18.947 --> 02:01:19.487]  They're scared.
[02:01:19.507 --> 02:01:23.069]  They kind of subconsciously compose a message.
[02:01:23.129 --> 02:01:23.850]  So here it goes.
[02:01:25.370 --> 02:01:28.933]  You can be scared and do nothing, or you cannot be scared and be free.
[02:01:29.933 --> 02:01:31.294]  And I think that's what these people need to do.
[02:01:31.314 --> 02:01:34.396]  They need to wake up and quit being scared and do something.
[02:01:34.436 --> 02:01:37.118]  Because how do you think they're going to feel when this goes down and they haven't done nothing?
[02:01:38.358 --> 02:01:39.379]  You know, what are they going to think?
[02:01:39.399 --> 02:01:42.721]  You know, are they going to be glad to go to the concentration camps and their family get killed or what?
[02:01:43.982 --> 02:01:48.085]  Well, as long as you're good and aren't with the terrorists, you'll be all right.
[02:01:48.605 --> 02:01:52.008]  The only jobs you'll be able to get is as a camp guard.
[02:01:52.028 --> 02:01:57.332]  There'll be lots of newscasts from inside the camps showing how bad we are as detainees.
[02:01:58.052 --> 02:01:58.232]  Yep.
[02:01:58.973 --> 02:02:00.374]  Yeah, we deserve it.
[02:02:00.394 --> 02:02:04.457]  Well, I'm going to let other guys get on, but I'd like to make an urgent request to all listeners.
[02:02:05.197 --> 02:02:08.279]  You can be scared and do nothing, or you cannot be scared and be free.
[02:02:08.400 --> 02:02:08.900]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:02:09.100 --> 02:02:10.301]  Infowars.com is good.
[02:02:11.309 --> 02:02:12.230]  God bless you, my friend.
[02:02:12.270 --> 02:02:13.030]  I appreciate that.
[02:02:13.490 --> 02:02:14.851]  Right now, we've got to be bold.
[02:02:15.271 --> 02:02:17.952]  We've got to let the New World Order know we're going to stand against them.
[02:02:18.633 --> 02:02:22.775]  Believe me, they're already shocked by how many of us are going public, but they can't intimidate us.
[02:02:23.035 --> 02:02:24.235]  Look, we've got the initiative.
[02:02:24.255 --> 02:02:24.775]  You understand?
[02:02:25.196 --> 02:02:27.797]  We're an arm-wrestling match, and we're pushing them down to the mat.
[02:02:28.037 --> 02:02:30.378]  They're pushing back right now, trying to get purchase.
[02:02:30.918 --> 02:02:31.559]  It's not going to work.
[02:02:32.539 --> 02:02:33.340]  Slam them down.
[02:02:33.360 --> 02:02:40.443]  If they start grunting on us, we've got to grunt right back down on them, give it that extra push, and we're going to slam these people.
[02:02:41.076 --> 02:02:41.596]  Slam them!
[02:02:41.896 --> 02:02:43.597]  Bring down the terrorists!
[02:02:47.259 --> 02:02:50.460]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[02:02:50.780 --> 02:02:52.741]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[02:02:53.102 --> 02:03:00.745]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:03:01.448 --> 02:03:08.471]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:03:08.872 --> 02:03:20.337]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:03:20.617 --> 02:03:24.139]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:03:24.599 --> 02:03:26.500]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:03:26.840 --> 02:03:30.682]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:03:49.514 --> 02:03:54.978]  Ideal for sporting games, camping or boating, or Sport Berkey is small enough to store in your glove box.

[02:04:02.964 --> 02:04:06.407]  So effective you can drink raw, untreated water from lakes, rivers, and streams.
[02:04:06.727 --> 02:04:07.508]  We're good to go.

[02:04:43.450 --> 02:04:47.511]  People who use Cardivite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[02:04:47.711 --> 02:04:51.112]  For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself time-tested.
[02:04:51.292 --> 02:04:54.733]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite.
[02:04:55.023 --> 02:04:58.286]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[02:04:58.306 --> 02:05:03.770]  This basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the disease that we see.
[02:05:03.810 --> 02:05:13.437]  When we do our program, you know, in herbal formulas like Cardavite, and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill, now going for a regular jog a few months later, we know we're doing something right.
[02:05:13.558 --> 02:05:14.919]  It's a well-thought-out formula.
[02:05:14.959 --> 02:05:20.343]  I mean, the idea of it working on yeast and metals both at the same time and liver function is dead-on.
[02:05:20.840 --> 02:05:25.323]  You'll find, I think, that it'll work more than just on heart problems and circulation problems.
[02:05:25.363 --> 02:05:26.724]  It'll work on other problems as well.
[02:05:26.904 --> 02:05:31.566]  For more information, call 1-877-928-8822 or visit our website at www.heartdrop.com That toll-free number again?

[02:05:45.112 --> 02:05:50.736]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:50.776 --> 02:06:03.085]  For those that just joined us, I have made my second prediction of my top radio career.
[02:06:04.586 --> 02:06:09.009]  From all the evidence I have, it is a prime conjunction...
[02:06:10.387 --> 02:06:14.270]  Of different elements of the government's operations, the crime syndicate's operations.
[02:06:14.830 --> 02:06:22.495]  We will see huge terror attacks between now and late October.
[02:06:25.737 --> 02:06:29.180]  And I went through in the first hour and some in the second hour why I think that's going to happen.
[02:06:29.220 --> 02:06:34.403]  And even Mike Malloy, a pretty mainstream radio host who's known to be liberal, says get out and buy guns.
[02:06:34.864 --> 02:06:37.165]  And that he's going to fight if there's an attempted takeover.
[02:06:37.545 --> 02:06:39.647]  We know criminal elements of the government.
[02:06:41.400 --> 02:06:43.281]  Are behind the terror attacks.
[02:06:44.202 --> 02:06:47.824]  We know they've staged a bunch of fake terror raids that were totally staged.
[02:06:47.864 --> 02:06:53.587]  In hindsight, again, the big headlines come out, and then days later, they have to respond, okay, it was really a setup.
[02:06:54.528 --> 02:06:56.789]  It wasn't just a sting, it was entrapment.
[02:06:56.809 --> 02:06:58.090]  So they're trying to create a solution.
[02:06:58.470 --> 02:07:02.152]  They've stopped all these attacks, and I've predicted that will lead up to them.
[02:07:02.212 --> 02:07:05.554]  I said years ago, you see a flurry of those to, oh, we missed one.
[02:07:06.818 --> 02:07:07.719]  We're good to go.
[02:07:07.739 --> 02:07:07.919]  I think?
[02:07:29.970 --> 02:07:33.171]  They said, I think I've got the transcript here, whitehouse.gov.
[02:07:33.211 --> 02:07:34.391]  It's on infowars.com.
[02:07:34.431 --> 02:07:35.751]  It's on prisonplanet.com.
[02:07:35.791 --> 02:07:36.931]  It's on jonesreport.com.
[02:07:38.052 --> 02:07:40.332]  They said, well, why are there all these terror alerts right now?
[02:07:40.352 --> 02:07:43.053]  Does this have anything to do with the scandal right now?
[02:07:43.093 --> 02:07:44.193]  And he said, yeah, what do you think it is?
[02:07:44.253 --> 02:07:44.773]  It's political.
[02:07:46.693 --> 02:07:47.193]  Fleischer.
[02:07:48.274 --> 02:07:52.774]  So, again, I've got MSNBC, CBS News, I've got World Net Daily.
[02:07:53.034 --> 02:07:55.895]  This is admitted for those that don't know or don't have a memory.
[02:07:56.420 --> 02:07:59.462]  I mean, I'm pretty freaked out that 30% of Americans don't know when 9-11 happened.
[02:07:59.502 --> 02:08:00.883]  I mean, they don't even know the year.
[02:08:01.984 --> 02:08:08.248]  September 11, 2001, for you neocons out there that are liberals and don't even know it.
[02:08:08.428 --> 02:08:09.889]  That's how dumb you are.
[02:08:10.089 --> 02:08:15.392]  According to your yardstick, according to your political paradigm, you are left of Chairman Mao.
[02:08:15.792 --> 02:08:16.673]  And I'm not joking.
[02:08:17.213 --> 02:08:19.175]  I mean, you are the latest model.
[02:08:20.095 --> 02:08:21.236]  You don't even know.
[02:08:23.726 --> 02:08:29.390]  And you don't know you're handled by a bunch of high-tech handlers that are just there to pacify you.
[02:08:31.411 --> 02:08:36.895]  Now, we have all this information converging, all this stuff happening.
[02:08:37.215 --> 02:08:39.036]  They will blame it on Iran or Syria.
[02:08:39.417 --> 02:08:40.717]  It will go into those countries.
[02:08:40.737 --> 02:08:45.961]  They're talking about openly calling it World War III and how great World War III is and how great total war is.
[02:08:46.281 --> 02:08:47.882]  The neocons, the Israelis are.
[02:08:48.282 --> 02:08:51.885]  That means stock market crash here, land-grabbing,
[02:08:52.890 --> 02:08:55.892]  Pension fund grabbing, they've already looted the entire treasury.
[02:08:56.212 --> 02:08:57.713]  They've already looted the Pentagon Trust.
[02:08:58.894 --> 02:08:59.954]  Over $3 trillion missing.
[02:09:00.815 --> 02:09:02.896]  These are hardcore criminals, okay?
[02:09:03.096 --> 02:09:08.260]  They make bank robbers and child kidnappers look like a tea party.
[02:09:10.341 --> 02:09:16.245]  These are hardcore killers who are proud of how sadistic and ruthless they are, okay?
[02:09:18.266 --> 02:09:18.386]  And...
[02:09:19.105 --> 02:09:21.206]  I'm not giving myself an out in a prediction.
[02:09:21.306 --> 02:09:22.807]  I don't make predictions, folks.
[02:09:22.867 --> 02:09:25.108]  I've made one before that came true.
[02:09:25.689 --> 02:09:26.849]  I'm making a second now.
[02:09:27.069 --> 02:09:31.532]  And as I focus deeper, as more of this emerges, I may even be able to predict the targets.
[02:09:32.172 --> 02:09:40.897]  I've got to watch more television because these sickos like to brag and I've got to catch a few of their key people and I've got to focus on some other things and think about it.
[02:09:40.937 --> 02:09:44.439]  But the point is, big terror attacks in England or the U.S.
[02:09:44.879 --> 02:09:48.321]  could even be in Israel, could be nuclear, could be biological.
[02:09:48.999 --> 02:09:55.825]  But I just see an attack happening as a pretext to go into World War III in the next few months, sooner rather than later.
[02:09:56.165 --> 02:09:59.128]  And if we really scream bloody murder, we can stop them from doing it.
[02:09:59.588 --> 02:10:00.189]  Understand.
[02:10:01.149 --> 02:10:04.492]  Some people didn't listen, or I didn't have a big enough show, or it was meant to happen.
[02:10:04.512 --> 02:10:05.553]  We couldn't stop 9-11.
[02:10:05.874 --> 02:10:08.135]  Even though I got on the air and said, call Bush, tell him don't do it.
[02:10:09.817 --> 02:10:10.598]  I mean, come on.
[02:10:11.298 --> 02:10:13.180]  I said, World Trade Center, they'll blame it on bin Laden.
[02:10:15.442 --> 02:10:16.763]  Now, I'm here again doing it,
[02:10:17.825 --> 02:10:21.127]  And I think people are going to listen this time, but it may not do enough.
[02:10:21.727 --> 02:10:22.848]  Really, it's up to you folks.
[02:10:22.888 --> 02:10:24.229]  But I know when I'm right.
[02:10:25.250 --> 02:10:27.311]  Shifting gears, I appreciate him holding the last three minutes.
[02:10:27.331 --> 02:10:28.131]  This is John Connor.
[02:10:28.211 --> 02:10:33.515]  He popped up a few years ago and last year wrote the book, The Resistance Manifesto, which has a second edition out.
[02:10:34.535 --> 02:10:35.156]  It's a great book.
[02:10:35.896 --> 02:10:38.237]  And it's a good day to have John on.
[02:10:38.277 --> 02:10:40.279]  John is a guerrilla info warrior.
[02:10:40.359 --> 02:10:42.320]  Every day he calls into a bunch of radio talk shows.
[02:10:43.075 --> 02:10:44.135]  He calls into Alan Combs.
[02:10:44.155 --> 02:10:45.136]  He calls into Michael Savage.
[02:10:45.156 --> 02:10:46.296]  He calls into Sean Hannity.
[02:10:46.676 --> 02:10:47.877]  He calls into Larry King Live.
[02:10:47.917 --> 02:10:49.097]  He calls into TV shows.
[02:10:49.497 --> 02:10:53.438]  He's having a big effect and getting a lot of attention out there.
[02:10:53.999 --> 02:11:00.521]  And lately he made headlines in a bunch of papers for boycotting Oliver Stone's new 9-11 film.
[02:11:02.148 --> 02:11:04.370]  And John Connor, good to have you on with us.
[02:11:04.730 --> 02:11:14.338]  It's a rare occurrence that I got on the air on a radio talk show, and I'm not hung up on immediately, personally insulted, and have the host play Twilight Zone music in the background.
[02:11:14.438 --> 02:11:22.024]  So thank you for actually addressing serious issues and being a patriot and caring about your country and your fellow human being.
[02:11:22.385 --> 02:11:26.348]  Well, John, tell us about your website, but then I want to get right into your take on
[02:11:26.883 --> 02:11:41.257]  I'm sure you've been listening, or I'm guessing you have, or you probably have the same take, on the latest, oh, they captured 21, oh, they were going to blow up 10 planes, oh my gosh, red alert, we're about to be hit by terrorists, it's imminent, give all your rights up, Iran's behind it, let's have World War III.
[02:11:41.697 --> 02:11:47.043]  I'm still waiting for reports to come out whether there were actual explosives or devices found.
[02:11:47.083 --> 02:11:51.547]  They say they were planning it, but they don't seem to have any evidence, at least they haven't reported this.
[02:11:52.170 --> 02:12:00.437]  I'm also waiting for the report to come out that a quote-unquote informant had infiltrated the group, and this is how they foiled the plot.
[02:12:00.497 --> 02:12:06.442]  So as the reports come out more, we're probably going to see that this is the same MO that's happened again.
[02:12:06.842 --> 02:12:18.912]  I want to add a caveat to the prediction of a looming major terrorist attack, and that is if a nuke goes off in this country, I think what they'll do is say that Iran...
[02:12:19.409 --> 02:12:20.129]  We're good to go.
[02:12:41.864 --> 02:12:45.085]  You know, they've been saying... They want a huge global meltdown.
[02:12:45.105 --> 02:12:46.886]  They want a stock market crash, folks.
[02:12:47.146 --> 02:12:48.946]  They want order out of chaos.
[02:12:48.986 --> 02:12:51.667]  Can you explain the mindset of the globalists, John?
[02:12:51.687 --> 02:12:52.847]  Because I know you're an expert on it.
[02:12:52.867 --> 02:12:54.288]  I mean, I agree with your analysis.
[02:12:54.688 --> 02:12:57.729]  So people understand why the globalists are different from you or I?
[02:12:58.569 --> 02:13:05.551]  These people, occasionally, Alex, will mention that they worship Lucifer, that they are satanic, that they're into the occult.
[02:13:05.791 --> 02:13:07.392]  These are not personal attacks.
[02:13:07.492 --> 02:13:08.492]  These people have the
[02:13:09.329 --> 02:13:09.989]  I think so.
[02:13:25.120 --> 02:13:25.840]  We're good to go.
[02:13:42.911 --> 02:13:45.371]  And becoming gods themselves.
[02:13:45.391 --> 02:13:45.972]  No, that's it.
[02:13:45.992 --> 02:13:52.313]  For those that don't know, Helmut Schmidt, German Chancellor, wrote a book and said he was a Luciferian and conducted rituals with the Bushes and others.
[02:13:52.813 --> 02:13:55.113]  You can get that at the library, folks, written by the German Chancellor.
[02:13:55.893 --> 02:14:08.935]  We have Tony Blair openly, literally 20 mainstream articles plus, BBC, you name it, channeling this white light, doing weird Aztec rituals everywhere he goes, spirits telling him what to do, the Bushes, Skull and Bones, Bohemian Grove.
[02:14:10.216 --> 02:14:11.316]  Folks, this is real.
[02:14:11.356 --> 02:14:12.076]  This is not a joke.
[02:14:12.356 --> 02:14:24.664]  Now, what's going to happen, what's going to come out of World War III is the global savior, and whether this is in five years or 50 years, the Antichrist will be the new Hitler to save the world.
[02:14:24.985 --> 02:14:37.613]  And this is the theme of the Freemasons and the Skull and Bone Secret Societies, and it's no coincidence that the Antichrist will take up his office in the rebuilt Solomon's Temple, and he will claim that he is God.
[02:14:37.913 --> 02:14:40.315]  And it's no coincidence that the Freemasons...
[02:14:40.768 --> 02:14:41.068]  Meanwhile...
[02:15:03.579 --> 02:15:06.401]  The globalists have bought off all the major church denominations.
[02:15:06.721 --> 02:15:08.563]  They're preparing for this leader.
[02:15:08.923 --> 02:15:11.685]  They're going to claim that the man who first rises is Jesus.
[02:15:12.125 --> 02:15:13.806]  Everything is set to worship Israel.
[02:15:14.047 --> 02:15:17.629]  Whoever rises there will be worshipped, because they think they're all going to be raptured out.
[02:15:17.689 --> 02:15:20.791]  They will recognize this individual as Jesus.
[02:15:21.332 --> 02:15:22.633]  Yes, and now the globalists...
[02:15:29.158 --> 02:15:34.320]  And the globalists are the ones that are committing terrorist attacks, false flag tear, blaming it on other enemies.
[02:15:34.568 --> 02:15:34.728]  I think.
[02:16:00.279 --> 02:16:01.440]  Well, this isn't a joke, folks.
[02:16:01.460 --> 02:16:05.262]  You know, we just did two hours of hard news, and I've been to Bohemian Grove.
[02:16:05.342 --> 02:16:07.083]  I mean, they write books, okay?
[02:16:07.343 --> 02:16:09.445]  I mean, you cannot deny Tony Blair's into this.
[02:16:09.825 --> 02:16:10.545]  Bush is into this.
[02:16:10.585 --> 02:16:11.826]  These chancellors are into this.
[02:16:12.327 --> 02:16:13.007]  This is what they're doing.
[02:16:13.047 --> 02:16:20.992]  But getting back into the actual nuts and bolts of it, do you think that screaming bloody murder, do you think exposing this, do you think talking about it could back them off?
[02:16:21.952 --> 02:16:23.373]  I think that it can slow it down.
[02:16:23.573 --> 02:16:27.235]  I do think that we can save, by doing this, we can save our families.
[02:16:27.535 --> 02:16:29.096]  We can maybe save America.
[02:16:29.796 --> 02:16:31.357]  We're going to have a hard fall.
[02:16:31.517 --> 02:16:32.718]  This country will go down.
[02:16:32.998 --> 02:16:37.640]  But I think what we can do, you know, we're not just going to lay down and wait for the rapture.
[02:16:37.921 --> 02:16:39.021]  We have to fight.
[02:16:39.081 --> 02:16:41.583]  We have to protect our families and our friends.
[02:16:41.923 --> 02:16:44.004]  And so we're not going to just lay down and let them do this.
[02:16:44.684 --> 02:16:47.166]  What we can do, there's going to be some people who are going to lose.
[02:16:47.206 --> 02:16:47.886]  There's two teams.
[02:16:47.926 --> 02:16:48.766]  There's a winning team.
[02:16:48.786 --> 02:16:49.587]  There's a losing team.
[02:16:49.952 --> 02:16:53.893]  Jesus said he came here to make us choose a side, so let's choose the winning side.
[02:16:54.173 --> 02:16:56.054]  Let's not roll over and let these guys do this.
[02:16:56.354 --> 02:16:58.255]  You know, we need to call a spade a spade.
[02:16:58.635 --> 02:17:01.716]  When somebody's committing a crime, you need to stand up and point it out.
[02:17:01.956 --> 02:17:04.697]  We can't just say, oh, well, you know, there's nothing we can do.
[02:17:05.217 --> 02:17:07.638]  You know, if somebody's breaking into your house, what are you going to do?
[02:17:07.658 --> 02:17:08.858]  Are you just going to let them do all this?
[02:17:09.358 --> 02:17:10.159]  You're going to fight them.
[02:17:10.179 --> 02:17:11.099]  You're going to go down to the fight.
[02:17:11.199 --> 02:17:13.300]  If you're going to lose, you're going to go down.
[02:17:13.320 --> 02:17:17.641]  You're going to hurt them before they hurt you, and this is our duty.
[02:17:19.091 --> 02:17:28.378]  I want to come back and get more into what we're facing and cover some of the news that's come out with this latest escalation in fear-mongering that really signals they're about to pull something big here.
[02:17:28.658 --> 02:17:31.721]  They're openly calling for World War III like it's a good thing.
[02:17:33.402 --> 02:17:35.503]  These are the traitors that are overthrowing the U.S.
[02:17:35.523 --> 02:17:39.526]  The people calling for World War III are the ones setting up the American Union right now.
[02:17:39.907 --> 02:17:41.368]  They're the ones coming after your guns.
[02:17:41.708 --> 02:17:42.929]  They're the ones for the illegal aliens.
[02:17:45.422 --> 02:17:54.608]  Now you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as triamethylenes, atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and MTBE to below detectable limits.
[02:17:54.869 --> 02:18:03.995]  Black Berkey elements are so powerful, they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water,
[02:18:04.235 --> 02:18:04.615]  We're good to go.
[02:18:19.568 --> 02:18:26.451]  Black Berkey elements flow one and a half to two times faster than ordinary gravity elements, which means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[02:18:26.751 --> 02:18:28.532]  Supercharge your gravity filter today.
[02:18:28.812 --> 02:18:30.893]  Upgrade to Black Berkey purification elements.
[02:18:30.973 --> 02:18:34.094]  Get a two-pack for only $99 or a four-pack for only $188.
[02:18:34.894 --> 02:18:35.995]  Call New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:18:36.015 --> 02:18:36.335]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:18:36.395 --> 02:18:38.176]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[02:18:49.586 --> 02:18:52.849]  Currency devaluation, inflation, one and the same.
[02:18:53.589 --> 02:18:57.533]  If you had deposited $100,000 in a bank at 1% in a 30-month period dating from May 24, 2005, here is what happened to your funds.
[02:19:03.843 --> 02:19:06.965]  The dollar lost 33% of its value in that time frame.
[02:19:07.225 --> 02:19:12.567]  The bank pays you 1%, your $100,000 now has a net purchasing power of $68,000.
[02:19:12.828 --> 02:19:14.909]  Here is reality.
[02:19:15.249 --> 02:19:18.851]  The devaluation of currency equals real inflation.
[02:19:19.331 --> 02:19:22.993]  Keep in mind how the value of your paper assets are measured in dollars.
[02:19:23.573 --> 02:19:26.154]  Gold in the same time frame increased 35% in value.
[02:19:27.751 --> 02:19:31.452]  Learn how to protect and profit in this truly unstable world economy.
[02:19:31.812 --> 02:19:33.452]  Call Midas Resources at 1-800-686-2237.
[02:19:33.732 --> 02:19:37.153]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:19:37.693 --> 02:19:47.395]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:19:47.675 --> 02:19:56.637]  Did you know that the Lenin School of Political Warfare has laid down a plan for a third world war that will destroy both Christianity and communism at the same time?
[02:19:57.418 --> 02:20:02.902]  From the rebels of this war, the Illuminati will establish their world government, prophesied in Revelation chapter 13.
[02:20:04.363 --> 02:20:14.331]  Communism said they would pretend to collapse, and when America had begun to disarm, the combined communist world would launch a surprise attack and smash us with their clenched fists.
[02:20:15.140 --> 02:20:22.282]  We'd like to show you how these things are coming to pass by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[02:20:23.002 --> 02:20:24.462]  Just call our toll-free number, 1-800-516-8736.
[02:20:24.482 --> 02:20:25.822]  That's 1-800-516-8736 to request your subscription.
[02:20:26.002 --> 02:20:26.723]  Call now.
[02:20:26.743 --> 02:20:30.183]  Operators are standing by to receive your call.
[02:20:42.293 --> 02:20:50.124]  By now it is no surprise that the US ranks 37th in the world in occurrence of chronic illness, according to the World Health Organization.
[02:20:50.344 --> 02:20:54.911]  Due to modern farming and food processing practices, our food supply has become new
[02:21:00.131 --> 02:21:03.132]  You have the right to decide what is attainable in your lifetime.
[02:21:28.439 --> 02:21:30.540]  Remember, we've got Marshall Law, 911.info, JonesReport.com, InfoWars.com.
[02:21:57.831 --> 02:22:00.513]  Infowars.net, prisonplanet.tv.
[02:22:00.933 --> 02:22:03.074]  Infowars.net is on its own server.
[02:22:03.754 --> 02:22:05.835]  Prisonplanet.tv is on its own server.
[02:22:06.996 --> 02:22:11.138]  Infowars and Prison Planet are two big sites that are on the same big server system.
[02:22:12.719 --> 02:22:17.542]  I don't want to say it's been being attacked the last few days, though that's exactly what it basically is.
[02:22:19.486 --> 02:22:21.428]  I mean, this stuff certifiably attacks.
[02:22:21.888 --> 02:22:25.112]  They've been going up and down, having problems, to just know about the other sites.
[02:22:25.152 --> 02:22:25.992]  And that's it.
[02:22:26.012 --> 02:22:28.074]  I'm going to start in the next few months a couple more sites.
[02:22:28.095 --> 02:22:31.458]  And we're about to redesign all the sites and make them even better and upgrade them.
[02:22:31.538 --> 02:22:33.620]  And so just tell everybody about the websites.
[02:22:33.640 --> 02:22:34.821]  We're trying to keep you from getting to them.
[02:22:35.662 --> 02:22:41.708]  I mean, we've had official problems in the past, actual people going in and putting stuff on the servers and other things.
[02:22:42.368 --> 02:22:43.669]  It's just what's going on right now.
[02:22:43.729 --> 02:22:46.972]  So just everybody, you know, know that we're fighting here to get you this information.
[02:22:47.373 --> 02:22:48.194]  So help us spread the word.
[02:22:48.714 --> 02:22:50.175]  Going back to John Connor.
[02:22:52.257 --> 02:22:55.941]  John, I am particularly disgusted by fake conservatives.
[02:22:56.001 --> 02:22:59.524]  I was on some sniveling show on a big station in Denver last night.
[02:23:00.188 --> 02:23:04.849]  And the guy actually didn't have me on to have me answer any questions.
[02:23:04.889 --> 02:23:06.730]  He wouldn't let me answer anything.
[02:23:06.990 --> 02:23:08.570]  He would claim I couldn't answer it.
[02:23:09.070 --> 02:23:14.312]  And he was all into how he's this former Marine and he's a great patriot and George Bush is basically Jesus.
[02:23:14.852 --> 02:23:17.713]  I don't know how these people can be so delusional.
[02:23:17.753 --> 02:23:21.694]  I guess they think of it as like they've picked a team and their team's good.
[02:23:22.074 --> 02:23:23.174]  It's really childish.
[02:23:23.234 --> 02:23:27.416]  Like they think because they think someone's good, they must be because they think they are.
[02:23:27.436 --> 02:23:28.716]  I mean, do you see the point I'm making?
[02:23:29.597 --> 02:23:33.339]  Sean Hannity is most likely a mockingbird asset.
[02:23:33.359 --> 02:23:37.081]  He's under a $25 million contract just for his radio show alone.
[02:23:37.161 --> 02:23:40.763]  So we're not going to be getting the truth from these phony neocons.
[02:23:40.803 --> 02:23:45.086]  All they are is mouthpieces for the neocons and for the Bush administration.
[02:23:45.646 --> 02:23:47.847]  And we need to take these people to the mat.
[02:23:47.947 --> 02:23:51.329]  Now, I hear Alex urging everybody to call into these talk shows.
[02:23:51.870 --> 02:23:57.713]  We need to do this constantly, and every other phone call needs to be addressing the issues of
[02:23:58.089 --> 02:23:58.870]  Better at hand.
[02:23:59.010 --> 02:24:00.711]  Operation Northwoods.
[02:24:00.731 --> 02:24:02.292]  9-11 was an inside job.
[02:24:02.652 --> 02:24:04.533]  Let's plug InfoWars.com.
[02:24:04.813 --> 02:24:09.976]  Let me give everybody a little tip so that you don't have to press redial for 30 minutes trying to get on hold.
[02:24:10.317 --> 02:24:14.599]  A lot of the shows will book the phone calls in the first 5 to 10 minutes.
[02:24:14.659 --> 02:24:19.442]  So don't be afraid to start calling in before the show actually goes to air.
[02:24:19.802 --> 02:24:23.785]  And then feed the screener a topic that's of significance.
[02:24:24.124 --> 02:24:24.925]  We're good to go.
[02:24:46.147 --> 02:24:48.768]  Without having the gatekeepers block our news.
[02:24:49.028 --> 02:25:15.098]  And this is a peaceful way to revolt against it, because if we really get aggressive and tell everybody else to do it, if they just start every other call, 9-11's an inside job, the government's about to stage another attack, prisonplanet.com, resistancemanifesto.com, we start doing that or plugging other sites, it's really, all the dumbbells out there, the sheep, Bush isn't a real conservative, he's a Trojan horse, prisonplanet.com, stuff like that can really bring them to their knees.
[02:25:15.638 --> 02:25:21.863]  Yeah, now I'll hear on the Mockingbird stations, occasionally they'll use Michael Moore as a typical liberalist.
[02:25:22.083 --> 02:25:24.885]  Well, the Michael Moores out there are saying this.
[02:25:25.185 --> 02:25:27.166]  The Cindy Sheehans are saying this.
[02:25:28.163 --> 02:25:31.145]  We need to elevate Alex Jones to that level.
[02:25:31.205 --> 02:25:42.511]  We need to have every day Sean Hannity say, well, you know, the Alex Joneses say... Well, Neil Bortz is already, they're already doing that some, which I actually don't like, but I mean, I get your point, though.
[02:25:42.591 --> 02:25:49.936]  To elevate Alex, he has the credibility, he has the integrity to be the one that can pierce through the mainstream media.
[02:25:50.615 --> 02:25:58.179]  Just the other day I was passing one of my neighbors and he said, hey, I was flipping through the stations the other day and I saw that Alex Jones guy on C-SPAN.
[02:25:58.439 --> 02:26:02.441]  This is just one of my neighbors, one of the many people that I've just handed out your videos to.
[02:26:02.901 --> 02:26:03.762]  He understands.
[02:26:04.338 --> 02:26:05.719]  Many people are coming around.
[02:26:05.979 --> 02:26:14.486]  I got a phone call from my mom the other day, and she said, did you hear that there's a University of Wisconsin professor that says 9-11's an inside job?
[02:26:14.806 --> 02:26:20.711]  Even my own mother, who just likes to hang out in her garden and not worry about all this, is coming around.
[02:26:20.791 --> 02:26:22.572]  So we're almost there, folks.
[02:26:22.652 --> 02:26:23.553]  Let's not give up.
[02:26:24.033 --> 02:26:30.598]  Every day, let's relentlessly pursue the mockingbirds, the phony talk shows, even the left-wings.
[02:26:30.698 --> 02:26:32.940]  For those that don't know what mockingbirds are, tell them.
[02:26:33.835 --> 02:26:44.678]  Operation Mockingbird was a CIA program some 50, 60 years ago where the CIA infiltrated most editors of most major media outlets, the talking heads.
[02:26:45.038 --> 02:26:46.838]  They have do-not-talk lists.
[02:26:46.918 --> 02:26:51.539]  There are lists of items that must not be addressed, that must not make it onto the air.
[02:26:52.099 --> 02:27:02.482]  So they are either CIA agents themselves as talking heads, as editors, or they are assets and paid off with their do-not-talk-about lists.
[02:27:05.027 --> 02:27:06.528]  Folks, you can't believe anything these people say.
[02:27:34.958 --> 02:27:35.841]  We're on the march.
[02:27:36.342 --> 02:27:37.946]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:38.869 --> 02:27:41.556]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:44.514 --> 02:27:51.339]  In December 2005, CNN had a special documentary about the inevitability of nuclear terrorism on American soil.
[02:27:51.600 --> 02:27:57.164]  When the mainstream media is reporting on such a perilous topic with such candor, it should be taken very seriously.

[02:30:53.765 --> 02:30:54.705]  Order out of chaos.
[02:30:54.725 --> 02:30:59.047]  The globalists that are in control of our country engineered World War I, World War II.
[02:30:59.907 --> 02:31:01.647]  They openly publish books.
[02:31:02.208 --> 02:31:04.668]  David Rockefeller is saying he wants to destroy America.
[02:31:05.069 --> 02:31:06.269]  The book he published two years ago.
[02:31:06.469 --> 02:31:10.210]  He actually says, yes, there's these people that claim I want to get rid of the U.S.
[02:31:10.270 --> 02:31:12.671]  and bring in world government, and they're right.
[02:31:13.711 --> 02:31:14.632]  They're doing it.
[02:31:14.692 --> 02:31:15.932]  Do you understand?
[02:31:16.932 --> 02:31:17.673]  That's why I got so mad.
[02:31:17.693 --> 02:31:18.913]  I was on this talk show last night.
[02:31:18.933 --> 02:31:20.975]  I was actually on two yesterday.
[02:31:21.275 --> 02:31:24.417]  I was on one last night and a couple in the morning, but two neocon shows.
[02:31:24.737 --> 02:31:26.819]  This guy on WRKO out of Boston.
[02:31:28.680 --> 02:31:31.482]  I was talking about how there's a move for global government.
[02:31:31.522 --> 02:31:32.462]  He just said that's not true.
[02:31:34.143 --> 02:31:38.626]  While he had socialists calling in who were saying they wanted it and it was going to be wonderful.
[02:31:41.028 --> 02:31:42.889]  We're going to go to your calls in a moment.
[02:31:42.909 --> 02:31:42.969]  1-800-259-9231
[02:31:46.237 --> 02:31:46.877]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:31:48.499 --> 02:31:50.180]  Mark and Seth and many others.
[02:31:50.440 --> 02:31:51.301]  John Connor is our guest.
[02:31:51.881 --> 02:31:53.703]  John, I want to play a few of these clips.
[02:31:53.723 --> 02:31:55.864]  You've got hundreds of them on your website.
[02:31:56.284 --> 02:32:01.008]  You're calling into Larry King and Sean Hannity and Savage and all of them.
[02:32:01.949 --> 02:32:06.512]  But before we go any further, tell us about your website and about your book.
[02:32:07.433 --> 02:32:11.075]  The website is TheResistanceManifesto.com.
[02:32:11.295 --> 02:32:14.478]  The book title is The Resistance Manifesto.
[02:32:15.385 --> 02:32:25.234]  It is the New World Order A to Z. It's a 400-page concordance of what they're doing from 9-11 to the rise of the Antichrist.
[02:32:25.895 --> 02:32:33.722]  And occasionally it turns people off to mention that these people are into the occult, that they worship Lucifer, but that's the key issue here.
[02:32:33.823 --> 02:32:35.644]  So that's what this is all building up to.
[02:32:36.385 --> 02:32:40.469]  And it covers most of the main topics from 9-11, Operation Northwoods,
[02:32:40.868 --> 02:32:44.249]  To how the Freemasons... Cybernetics, the microchips, everything.
[02:32:44.589 --> 02:32:44.969]  Everything.
[02:32:45.049 --> 02:32:45.870]  It's coming down.
[02:32:45.930 --> 02:32:47.610]  Every chapter ties into the next.
[02:32:48.230 --> 02:32:51.051]  And it is a concordance of the New World Order.
[02:32:51.391 --> 02:32:55.372]  It's available exclusively at theresistancemanifesto.com.
[02:32:55.793 --> 02:32:58.293]  So people will call me up or email me, well, tell me more.
[02:32:58.333 --> 02:32:58.874]  What about this?
[02:32:58.934 --> 02:32:59.454]  What about this?
[02:32:59.474 --> 02:33:03.575]  I've written a 400-page book explaining what's happening.
[02:33:04.053 --> 02:33:11.516]  And so if you would like to know my insight on it, and it's not only just me saying this, I quote the Satanists themselves out of their very own books.
[02:33:11.596 --> 02:33:14.097]  So they're the ones that are saying what they're doing.
[02:33:14.117 --> 02:33:14.698]  I know.
[02:33:14.738 --> 02:33:24.222]  I mean, how do you have a German chancellor saying, we're the Bilderberg Group, we run the planet, I love doing rituals at the Grove in Germany, but my favorite place is with the Bushes in California.
[02:33:24.582 --> 02:33:26.523]  I mean, this is German presidents, folks.
[02:33:27.043 --> 02:33:35.307]  And a book, Externalization of the Hierarchy, which I'm sure is in the Skull and Bones tomb library in mandatory reading for the globalists, lays it all out.
[02:33:35.647 --> 02:33:37.508]  It says that they've infiltrated the church.
[02:33:37.668 --> 02:33:41.629]  It says that the Freemasons are the true key holders of the light.
[02:33:41.909 --> 02:33:48.612]  And it says that once they have built up their strength strong enough so that nobody can stop them, that they're going to come out from the shadows.
[02:33:48.632 --> 02:33:54.395]  They're going to externalize the hierarchy and announce that, yes, we've been doing this
[02:33:54.975 --> 02:34:02.759]  We're thousands of years working in secret, and so now we can tell you now that our Savior Lucifer has come.
[02:34:02.799 --> 02:34:04.100]  So that's what it's about.
[02:34:04.200 --> 02:34:07.321]  And by the way, you've all got to die before our heaven can be here.
[02:34:08.322 --> 02:34:11.543]  Let's go ahead and take some calls.
[02:34:11.603 --> 02:34:15.085]  But I just want to reiterate to everybody out there who's listening,
[02:34:17.293 --> 02:34:18.573]  That this isn't a joke.
[02:34:18.593 --> 02:34:19.974]  These people really are terrorists.
[02:34:20.034 --> 02:34:21.674]  They really are staging terror attacks.
[02:34:21.714 --> 02:34:23.295]  They really did carry out 9-11.
[02:34:23.695 --> 02:34:25.355]  And they're saying we're about to get hit again.
[02:34:25.796 --> 02:34:30.777]  And they're staging all these captures of terrorists so they can say, well, we caught most of them.
[02:34:30.837 --> 02:34:32.017]  Sorry you got hit again.
[02:34:32.398 --> 02:34:33.158]  It's Iran.
[02:34:33.198 --> 02:34:34.138]  We've got to go in there.
[02:34:34.398 --> 02:34:35.699]  They're really moving.
[02:34:35.959 --> 02:34:36.779]  This isn't a drill.
[02:34:38.259 --> 02:34:40.300]  But they're also watching, engaging us.
[02:34:41.841 --> 02:34:47.763]  They think that they're having to stage all these events right now to get us scared so we'll go jump in their arms.
[02:34:48.164 --> 02:34:49.164]  And so we'll go along with this.
[02:34:49.244 --> 02:34:55.026]  We've got to ring the alarm bells like Paul Revere that you do not want to go with these people.
[02:34:55.246 --> 02:34:56.107]  That they're the bad guys.
[02:34:57.071 --> 02:35:00.472]  We've got a bunch of press releases coming out at InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:35:00.792 --> 02:35:06.313]  If those sites are down, they've been having problems the last few days, you can go to PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:35:06.373 --> 02:35:07.334]  It's on its own server.
[02:35:07.654 --> 02:35:09.634]  InfoWars.net is on a separate server.
[02:35:10.494 --> 02:35:14.335]  Those two sites are alternate designated sites.
[02:35:14.675 --> 02:35:16.136]  There's a lot of other great sites as well.
[02:35:16.716 --> 02:35:19.016]  If we have to, we'll get our information out to people that way.
[02:35:19.897 --> 02:35:23.277]  Let's go ahead and talk to Seth.
[02:35:23.878 --> 02:35:25.358]  And Seth, where are you calling us from?
[02:35:26.869 --> 02:35:28.209]  Hi, I'm calling from Omaha.
[02:35:28.589 --> 02:35:29.089]  Welcome, sir.
[02:35:29.109 --> 02:35:29.510]  Go ahead.
[02:35:30.150 --> 02:35:30.590]  Yeah, hi.
[02:35:30.670 --> 02:35:31.670]  I called last year.
[02:35:31.690 --> 02:35:34.791]  I was talking about those RFID tags.
[02:35:36.171 --> 02:35:56.055]  Today, I was looking at the local newspaper's website, Omaha.com, and they have a poll about that fake terror alert over in Britain about how all the liquids are banned from the carry-ons now, and almost more than 900 more people agree with the fake Homeland Security policy
[02:35:56.579 --> 02:35:58.260]  Crap, and disagree with it.
[02:36:00.120 --> 02:36:02.501]  But see, people are compartmentalized mentally, too.
[02:36:02.581 --> 02:36:10.683]  A lot of those of you who talk to them, they believe that 9-11 is an inside job, but then they'll be scared of this event separately.
[02:36:11.103 --> 02:36:13.664]  I appreciate your call, sir, bringing up that issue.
[02:36:13.704 --> 02:36:14.544]  Listen, this is what happens.
[02:36:14.584 --> 02:36:19.506]  People, when something new comes out, are scared and do buy into it, but over time, they don't.
[02:36:20.286 --> 02:36:22.328]  Yes, there's bombs that can be liquid.
[02:36:22.388 --> 02:36:23.609]  Let's ban everything.
[02:36:24.069 --> 02:36:25.950]  It's all about training you to be a slave.
[02:36:25.970 --> 02:36:34.217]  It's like when I walk through security with a bottle of water before they go pull it out of your bag, take a drink of it, or take your shoes off, your feet are stinky.
[02:36:34.497 --> 02:36:38.220]  It's about letting you get shoved around a little bit, letting you get laughed at a little bit.
[02:36:38.580 --> 02:36:40.061]  Hey, let's go search your bags now.
[02:36:40.121 --> 02:36:41.322]  Hey, I said over here.
[02:36:41.562 --> 02:36:42.383]  Hey, hey, hey!
[02:36:42.963 --> 02:36:45.025]  It's about letting you know how to be a prisoner.
[02:36:45.445 --> 02:36:47.627]  This is like when you first get to prison if you're a perp.
[02:36:48.687 --> 02:36:53.528]  If you're a convict, when you get there, they're going to let you know this is a new life.
[02:36:53.949 --> 02:36:54.889]  This is how it is.
[02:36:55.089 --> 02:36:56.129]  You're in prison now.
[02:36:56.309 --> 02:36:57.049]  Do you got it?
[02:36:57.489 --> 02:36:58.530]  John Connor comments.
[02:36:59.010 --> 02:37:08.672]  Yeah, I would like to add that if and when there is another major terrorist attack that makes September 11th look like a car accident, the 9-11 Truth Movement isn't going to be focused on.
[02:37:08.712 --> 02:37:11.433]  People are going to be worrying and talking about the latest events.
[02:37:11.715 --> 02:37:15.996]  9-11 is going to be some attack that happened years and years ago.
[02:37:16.116 --> 02:37:23.078]  That's another reason they may have to go ahead and carry something out clean like a nuke going off, because you never find out what happens.
[02:37:24.278 --> 02:37:25.638]  Oh, 9-11, that's old!
[02:37:25.858 --> 02:37:28.519]  Yeah, 9-11 truth movement, that's something from years ago.
[02:37:28.539 --> 02:37:33.080]  We have this new terrorist attack that we need to focus on, that we need to worry about.
[02:37:34.987 --> 02:37:37.970]  And whoever's got the radio on, please turn it off.
[02:37:38.311 --> 02:37:39.352]  But you're absolutely right.
[02:37:39.452 --> 02:37:42.195]  That is exactly another reason.
[02:37:42.555 --> 02:37:45.118]  And again, I've said over and over again, it's a catch-22.
[02:37:45.178 --> 02:37:49.182]  We've exposed their terror paradigm so they haven't carried out attacks for five years.
[02:37:49.562 --> 02:37:50.343]  And they were going to.
[02:37:51.144 --> 02:37:51.985]  All the evidence was there.
[02:37:52.025 --> 02:37:52.766]  They were moving to.
[02:37:52.786 --> 02:37:54.828]  But they were still kind of an open...
[02:37:55.922 --> 02:37:56.743]  We're good to go.
[02:38:18.420 --> 02:38:18.821]  Duty.
[02:38:19.422 --> 02:38:20.423]  Duty belongs to us.
[02:38:20.463 --> 02:38:21.684]  Consequence belongs to God.
[02:38:22.045 --> 02:38:23.567]  John Connor, you want to respond to that?
[02:38:23.627 --> 02:38:28.153]  That regardless of what the quote consequences are, we've got to do the right thing?
[02:38:29.348 --> 02:38:30.489]  We must do the right thing.
[02:38:30.609 --> 02:38:42.938]  And put yourself, if you were a German citizen, if you were a German-blooded citizen back during World War II or before the war during the rise of Hitler, imagine what it would have been like to stand up and say, you know, this isn't right.
[02:38:43.399 --> 02:38:45.560]  I think that, you know, Hitler burned the Reichstag.
[02:38:45.981 --> 02:38:46.881]  He is a dictator.
[02:38:47.302 --> 02:38:47.822]  This is not right.
[02:38:48.142 --> 02:38:49.824]  Everybody would have attacked you.
[02:38:50.184 --> 02:38:53.686]  Everybody would have said that you are not a German citizen.
[02:38:53.707 --> 02:38:55.568]  You're with the Jews.
[02:38:55.976 --> 02:39:06.149]  And so we can't just lay down, even though there is a possibility that they will carry out a nuke or another major attack to whitewash, to put 9-11 on the back burner.
[02:39:06.169 --> 02:39:07.030]  You never give in.
[02:39:07.070 --> 02:39:08.592]  You never negotiate with terrorists.
[02:39:09.569 --> 02:39:09.869]  Never.
[02:39:09.989 --> 02:39:13.051]  You have to just keep pointing out their criminal activity.
[02:39:14.071 --> 02:39:14.811]  You said it the best.
[02:39:15.152 --> 02:39:15.852]  Duty's ours.
[02:39:16.192 --> 02:39:17.473]  Consequence belongs to God.
[02:39:17.693 --> 02:39:23.095]  And Jesus said in Matthew 24, 6, there will be wars and rumors of wars.
[02:39:23.275 --> 02:39:25.016]  And he said to not be afraid.
[02:39:25.076 --> 02:39:26.416]  So I'm not afraid.
[02:39:26.817 --> 02:39:28.117]  I'm just very concerned.
[02:39:29.318 --> 02:39:30.058]  Well, I know this.
[02:39:30.258 --> 02:39:32.079]  It's only going to be worse if we don't fight them.
[02:39:32.993 --> 02:39:34.916]  And these people have got to be resisted.
[02:39:35.858 --> 02:39:38.121]  We're going to go back to your calls in a moment, but let's play a few clips.
[02:39:38.461 --> 02:39:39.363]  I've only got three of these.
[02:39:39.603 --> 02:39:41.886]  I know you sent us about ten, John, but there's so many.
[02:39:42.367 --> 02:39:45.211]  We've got a couple with Sean Hannity, one with Savage.
[02:39:45.592 --> 02:39:47.595]  Let's play these Sean Hannity clips first.
[02:39:47.635 --> 02:39:48.256]  Go ahead and roll it.
[02:39:50.967 --> 02:39:51.908]  Uh, John, hello.
[02:39:52.288 --> 02:40:03.095]  With all the evidence that's coming forward from Operation Northwoods to Able Danger that's coming to the surface, is it really that hard now to believe that September 11th... All right, goodbye.
[02:40:03.235 --> 02:40:05.057]  Yes, isn't that nutcase.
[02:40:05.177 --> 02:40:10.260]  Let us go to... So, yeah, don't want that information to get out.
[02:40:10.300 --> 02:40:11.341]  Don't want folks to find out.
[02:40:11.661 --> 02:40:12.782]  Huh, do we shine?
[02:40:12.982 --> 02:40:13.882]  Do we shine?
[02:40:14.063 --> 02:40:17.905]  Don't want us to find out about what the government did, did we?
[02:40:18.385 --> 02:40:19.106]  Uh, John Connor?
[02:40:19.986 --> 02:40:20.686]  Yeah, I mean, there you go.
[02:40:20.746 --> 02:40:22.167]  It's on his Do Not Talk About list.
[02:40:22.207 --> 02:40:26.129]  He knew exactly what I was getting at and doesn't even want to get it on the air.
[02:40:26.189 --> 02:40:28.250]  Won't even debate the issue.
[02:40:28.290 --> 02:40:29.750]  Can't do it.
[02:40:29.770 --> 02:40:36.413]  And in the next clip with Sean Hannity, he made the mistake of asking me to enlighten the audience.
[02:40:36.433 --> 02:40:38.434]  So he did give me about a minute to lay the case.
[02:40:38.494 --> 02:40:40.035]  Let's see what Sean does this time.
[02:40:40.075 --> 02:40:41.736]  Do we have the minute-long clip, sir?
[02:40:42.076 --> 02:40:42.516]  Go ahead.
[02:40:43.630 --> 02:40:44.811]  Oh, this ought to be interesting.
[02:40:44.952 --> 02:40:46.173]  Connor, Los Angeles.
[02:40:46.193 --> 02:40:46.894]  How are you, Connor?
[02:40:47.354 --> 02:40:49.257]  You're a terrible American, Sean Hannity.
[02:40:49.297 --> 02:40:54.643]  You're a mainstream media mockingbird, a New World Order shill, and a 9-11 whitewasher.
[02:40:55.704 --> 02:40:57.025]  And what happened on 9-11?
[02:40:57.065 --> 02:40:59.248]  Why don't you educate us, oh brilliant one?
[02:41:00.278 --> 02:41:02.639]  9-11 was an inside job on one level.
[02:41:02.739 --> 02:41:06.161]  It was purposely allowed to happen as a pretext for the war on terror.
[02:41:06.401 --> 02:41:12.324]  On another level, elements within the shadow government helped and made sure it were to happen for a pretext.
[02:41:12.384 --> 02:41:13.225]  Why don't you open your eyes?
[02:41:13.265 --> 02:41:15.225]  Look at Operation Northwood, Sean Hannity.
[02:41:15.626 --> 02:41:22.269]  A declassified government plan to commit terrorism in this country by crashing planes and blaming it on a political enemy.
[02:41:22.828 --> 02:41:23.749]  Yeah.
[02:41:23.809 --> 02:41:24.190]  Yeah.
[02:41:24.250 --> 02:41:25.251]  Okay, stop with the music.
[02:41:25.291 --> 02:41:26.632]  Let's talk about the issue seriously.
[02:41:26.732 --> 02:41:27.893]  Operation Northwoods.
[02:41:27.934 --> 02:41:30.016]  Why don't you look it up on the Internet, Sean?
[02:41:30.216 --> 02:41:32.118]  Okay, you know, if it's on the Internet, it's got to be true.
[02:41:32.138 --> 02:41:35.121]  No, it's a declassified document, Sean, in the National Archives, sir.
[02:41:35.181 --> 02:41:35.702]  I know.
[02:41:35.942 --> 02:41:36.462]  I know, sir.
[02:41:36.683 --> 02:41:37.283]  Yeah, Northwoods.
[02:41:37.323 --> 02:41:39.706]  Why don't you substitute the word... Let me ask you a question.
[02:41:39.826 --> 02:41:41.227]  Let me ask you a question.
[02:41:41.247 --> 02:41:42.629]  Let me ask you a question.
[02:41:43.290 --> 02:41:45.372]  Whatever's inside you, did they implant it?
[02:41:46.118 --> 02:41:51.261]  Speaking of implanting things, let's talk about the Verichip implantable microchip, which is going to start coming, Sean.
[02:41:51.281 --> 02:41:52.682]  I've got to go.
[02:41:52.762 --> 02:41:53.683]  Thank you very much.
[02:41:53.763 --> 02:41:54.884]  Now, let's go to our phones.
[02:41:54.944 --> 02:41:59.807]  By the way, the incredible thing is, Hannity's been on TV saying every child needs one.
[02:42:00.207 --> 02:42:01.248]  Buy stock in it.
[02:42:02.060 --> 02:42:04.462]  Okay, I've got that on video, but then you're a cook.
[02:42:04.542 --> 02:42:11.407]  See, I mean, and notice, you did a great job there by saying, hey, go ahead, hang up on me, you mockingbird propagandist.
[02:42:11.647 --> 02:42:13.689]  He had to give you a little bit or he'd sound bad.
[02:42:13.729 --> 02:42:15.630]  You really set him up good there.
[02:42:16.091 --> 02:42:20.734]  Well, and then, of course, they play the Twilight Zone in the background, and he won't even debate the issue.
[02:42:20.834 --> 02:42:21.455]  All he says is...
[02:42:21.835 --> 02:42:23.955]  Yeah, okay, sure.
[02:42:24.035 --> 02:42:31.577]  Still, still, still, a lot of his audience, the people that think, not the drooling liberals that are so liberal they don't even know they're programmed to think they're conservative.
[02:42:31.637 --> 02:42:32.737]  I mean, that's zombie, folks.
[02:42:33.117 --> 02:42:34.317]  That's the new wave of liberal.
[02:42:34.337 --> 02:42:35.078]  They don't even know it.
[02:42:35.118 --> 02:42:36.318]  That's how brainwashed they are.
[02:42:36.398 --> 02:42:37.018]  They're incredible.
[02:42:38.318 --> 02:42:43.439]  That a lot of people are going to go Google Northwoods and it's over for you, Sean.
[02:42:44.579 --> 02:42:45.239]  And that's the point.
[02:42:45.279 --> 02:42:47.600]  That's why we need to start plugging InfoWars.com.
[02:42:48.291 --> 02:42:48.711]  We're good to go.
[02:43:11.351 --> 02:43:21.258]  People will go just out of curiosity and check out to see what it is that that caller brought up and why Sean Insanity wouldn't address the issues.
[02:43:23.060 --> 02:43:23.420]  I know.
[02:43:23.500 --> 02:43:24.661]  It's just so sick.
[02:43:25.862 --> 02:43:26.822]  It's amazing.
[02:43:26.942 --> 02:43:31.145]  Let's play one of the top beatniks from the 60s.
[02:43:31.686 --> 02:43:36.970]  This is a man who wrote books about his passion with other men.
[02:43:37.030 --> 02:43:38.771]  This is your Christian conservative leader.
[02:43:39.585 --> 02:43:41.167]  This is the dual citizen.
[02:43:41.207 --> 02:43:42.629]  This is the oily beatnik.
[02:43:43.409 --> 02:43:46.473]  This is the beast himself.
[02:43:46.933 --> 02:43:49.917]  Let's go ahead and roll a clip of Michael Weiner.
[02:43:50.037 --> 02:43:52.680]  You know him as Savage, the demonic dwarf.
[02:43:52.700 --> 02:43:53.080]  Here it is.
[02:43:53.601 --> 02:43:56.424]  John, on KFMB in San Diego, you're on the Savage Nation.
[02:43:56.963 --> 02:44:11.350]  Michael, so many prominent people like Morgan Reynolds, former economist to the Department of Labor during Bush's first term, and BYU physics professor Stephen Jones... Please, sir, you're way in the... What's the point?
[02:44:11.410 --> 02:44:13.931]  And then tell us who said it, because I don't know what you're referring to.
[02:44:13.951 --> 02:44:15.812]  Prominent people are coming out...
[02:44:16.585 --> 02:44:25.511]  Expressing doubt about the official 9-11 story and saying that not only is the government covering it up, but that the government has... Here we go.
[02:44:25.531 --> 02:44:29.854]  Now you're going to give me a website that says that the protocols of the Ellis of Zion did it.
[02:44:31.263 --> 02:44:33.925]  The elders of Zion were the... Well, we know the Jews did it, right?
[02:44:33.965 --> 02:44:35.727]  We know that the Jews did everything bad.
[02:44:35.987 --> 02:44:36.888]  Jews do nothing good.
[02:44:36.928 --> 02:44:37.829]  Is that correct, John?
[02:44:38.249 --> 02:44:41.612]  The Illuminati's control... Ah, yeah, the Illuminati.
[02:44:41.752 --> 02:44:42.473]  I haven't met any.
[02:44:42.493 --> 02:44:43.133]  Where do they live?
[02:44:43.293 --> 02:44:46.276]  Can I attend one of their coffee houses or coffee sessions?
[02:44:46.816 --> 02:44:47.957]  Yeah, well, anyway, let's get back.
[02:44:47.977 --> 02:44:49.658]  9-11's an inside job.
[02:44:49.698 --> 02:44:51.058]  The government let it happen.
[02:44:51.839 --> 02:44:53.920]  World War II was an inside job, too, wasn't it?
[02:44:54.600 --> 02:44:58.503]  I'm not one of your pupils, if you have any, John.
[02:44:58.783 --> 02:44:59.643]  What's your main point?
[02:44:59.683 --> 02:45:00.324]  Make it quickly.
[02:45:00.344 --> 02:45:01.344]  30 seconds or less.
[02:45:01.364 --> 02:45:02.045]  Go ahead, please.
[02:45:02.445 --> 02:45:03.665]  Check out The Resistance.
[02:45:04.046 --> 02:45:04.746]  No, no, no, no.
[02:45:04.766 --> 02:45:06.527]  You're not getting any websites on my show.
[02:45:06.847 --> 02:45:07.908]  Make the point yourself.
[02:45:07.988 --> 02:45:08.708]  No websites.
[02:45:08.728 --> 02:45:13.471]  The government not only allowed September 11th to happen... I'm going to say it once again.
[02:45:13.851 --> 02:45:14.471]  Shut your mouth.
[02:45:14.752 --> 02:45:15.272]  Listen to me.
[02:45:15.899 --> 02:45:17.840]  You've got 30 seconds to make your statement.
[02:45:17.880 --> 02:45:20.262]  If you cite a website, I'm going to cut you off.
[02:45:20.662 --> 02:45:21.883]  You make it in your own words.
[02:45:21.923 --> 02:45:22.644]  Go ahead, please.
[02:45:23.510 --> 02:45:26.352]  September 11th was allowed to happen.
[02:45:26.392 --> 02:45:28.333]  It was not a surprise attack.
[02:45:28.393 --> 02:45:30.295]  It wasn't an intelligence failure.
[02:45:30.315 --> 02:45:34.618]  The same strategy has happened numerous times throughout history.
[02:45:34.638 --> 02:45:49.608]  And it was allowed to happen to further the New World Order and the war in Iraq and the war on terrorism, the war to destroy our freedoms and further the New World Order for the neocons and the Illuminati and the criminals who are furthering this agenda.
[02:45:49.628 --> 02:45:50.849]  Mm-hmm.
[02:45:51.972 --> 02:45:53.292]  Is that the entire statement?
[02:45:53.333 --> 02:45:55.133]  And what's the proof of that?
[02:45:56.534 --> 02:45:57.194]  Open your eyes.
[02:45:57.234 --> 02:46:04.776]  Look at Operation Northwood, the declassified government plan to commit terrorism in American soil in Washington, D.C.
[02:46:04.816 --> 02:46:07.858]  Have you experienced a loss of your civil rights?
[02:46:07.898 --> 02:46:11.779]  You're able to stand here and accuse the government of heinous crimes?
[02:46:12.734 --> 02:46:17.098]  You're able to stand there on my radio show and put down the government and say that you've lost your rights?
[02:46:17.178 --> 02:46:18.600]  Where have you lost your rights, sir?
[02:46:18.860 --> 02:46:21.162]  They said they allowed September 11th to happen.
[02:46:21.583 --> 02:46:22.303]  No, wait a minute.
[02:46:22.323 --> 02:46:28.850]  You're implying there's a creepy, ghoulish, Bush-Cheney conspiracy to take over the world?
[02:46:29.622 --> 02:46:33.206]  And that they did 9-11, they let it happen, and they're going to steal our rights.
[02:46:33.266 --> 02:46:34.147]  Give me some evidence.
[02:46:34.208 --> 02:46:34.948]  What is your evidence?
[02:46:35.449 --> 02:46:37.491]  Cheney had NORAD stand down.
[02:46:37.572 --> 02:46:40.195]  They didn't dispatch the planes up there.
[02:46:40.255 --> 02:46:41.616]  Nobody did anything.
[02:46:42.077 --> 02:46:47.143]  Nobody stopped the terrorists from training at the flight centers.
[02:46:47.742 --> 02:46:49.603]  They had Moussaoui's computer.
[02:46:49.683 --> 02:46:50.563]  Nobody did anything.
[02:46:50.603 --> 02:46:54.784]  President Bush signed a presidential decision directive to pull agents off.
[02:46:54.904 --> 02:46:58.285]  So you're of the school that believes it's a government conspiracy.
[02:46:58.405 --> 02:47:00.425]  And so, therefore, what are you going to do about it?
[02:47:00.986 --> 02:47:03.146]  I'm going to tell everybody that I know the truth.
[02:47:03.266 --> 02:47:04.726]  And what was it?
[02:47:04.767 --> 02:47:06.487]  You want Hillary Clinton to save the nation?
[02:47:07.441 --> 02:47:07.661]  No.
[02:47:07.961 --> 02:47:10.083]  I'm a conservative, Michael, actually, and it's sad.
[02:47:10.143 --> 02:47:11.444]  I just call Michael Sam.
[02:47:11.504 --> 02:47:14.486]  I'm not... All right, well, you're entitled to your opinion.
[02:47:14.626 --> 02:47:16.527]  I'm not here to tell you you shouldn't have your opinion.
[02:47:16.887 --> 02:47:24.893]  So the beatnik, you know, is smarter than Michael Hannity operative, and so the man who writes love poems to his lovers...
[02:47:26.693 --> 02:47:38.904]  I mean, you try to tell conservatives that Savage wrote books that sold very well about his private relationships with other men, and how much he loves them, and the pleasures they have together.
[02:47:39.605 --> 02:47:44.109]  And he sits there, but at least he let you talk a little bit.
[02:47:44.689 --> 02:47:49.672]  No, he wouldn't let me give out a website so people could actually find the documents, but I would respond.
[02:47:49.912 --> 02:47:52.133]  They're using the Patriot Act against citizens all the time.
[02:47:52.373 --> 02:47:53.854]  They're grabbing private property now.
[02:47:54.074 --> 02:47:57.396]  They're stealing the pension funds dry.
[02:47:57.716 --> 02:47:58.376]  They're looting.
[02:47:58.396 --> 02:47:59.637]  They're putting us into wars.
[02:47:59.997 --> 02:48:01.998]  They're trying to pass laws for secret arrest.
[02:48:02.858 --> 02:48:03.719]  They're torturing.
[02:48:04.119 --> 02:48:06.540]  I mean, no one can deny that we're entering tyranny, John Connor.
[02:48:07.321 --> 02:48:11.683]  No, and I actually was surprised when I called him one of the times about Bohemian Grove.
[02:48:12.153 --> 02:48:14.455]  He said, do you have evidence of this?
[02:48:14.595 --> 02:48:15.916]  Can you post this somewhere?
[02:48:16.396 --> 02:48:22.781]  And then when I plugged InfoWars.com, they used the dump button to bleep out the web address.
[02:48:22.941 --> 02:48:25.322]  So let's just bring these people to the mat.
[02:48:25.623 --> 02:48:26.763]  Let's call them every day.
[02:48:26.803 --> 02:48:31.887]  Let's plug Alex Jones and InfoWars.com until they can't take a phone call without hearing about it.
[02:48:31.967 --> 02:48:35.309]  Well, we've got to expose the fact that they're about to engineer another terror attack.
[02:48:35.369 --> 02:48:36.530]  All the indicators are there.
[02:48:36.650 --> 02:48:38.171]  It's going down right now, folks.
[02:48:38.512 --> 02:48:40.173]  Warn everybody we can back them off.
[02:48:47.131 --> 02:48:50.334]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[02:48:50.694 --> 02:48:52.636]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[02:48:52.996 --> 02:49:00.662]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:49:01.343 --> 02:49:08.388]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:49:08.788 --> 02:49:11.731]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran.
[02:49:12.071 --> 02:49:14.433]  The White House probing to disseminate fake news.
[02:49:14.853 --> 02:49:15.654]  NSA spies.
[02:49:17.084 --> 02:49:20.206]  The latest 9-11 information and much, much more.
[02:49:20.506 --> 02:49:23.988]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:49:24.488 --> 02:49:26.409]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:49:26.729 --> 02:49:30.651]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:49:44.830 --> 02:49:45.810]  Good morning, honey.
[02:49:46.170 --> 02:49:52.212]  Wow, the weather is beautiful, the cabin is terrific, and it's the first day of our vacation.
[02:49:52.532 --> 02:49:53.153]  Yeah.
[02:49:53.553 --> 02:49:54.953]  Honey, is there something wrong?
[02:49:55.333 --> 02:49:58.774]  Yeah, I just realized we forgot to pack the travel Berkey system.
[02:49:59.255 --> 02:50:00.755]  I can't drink this cabin water.
[02:50:01.215 --> 02:50:02.956]  And what am I going to do when I'm out on the lake?
[02:50:03.336 --> 02:50:05.117]  Now the whole vacation is ruined.
[02:50:05.337 --> 02:50:06.257]  Honey, cheer up.
[02:50:06.617 --> 02:50:08.918]  I brought our Sport Berkey purifiers.
[02:50:09.198 --> 02:50:09.458]  What?
[02:50:09.932 --> 02:50:20.545]  Yeah, I know you're picky about not having pathogenic bacteria, organic chemicals, heavy metals or foul tastes and odors in the water, so I packed our Sport Berkey Purifiers.
[02:50:20.866 --> 02:50:25.752]  You know, this is a terrific cabin, and wow, have you noticed the beautiful weather?
[02:50:26.212 --> 02:50:27.373]  Don't ruin your vacation.

[02:50:31.215 --> 02:50:32.536]  Travel Berkey not available in Iowa.

[02:51:51.220 --> 02:51:53.441]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:51:53.461 --> 02:52:03.425]  All right, let's try to jam a bunch of phone calls in here.
[02:52:05.146 --> 02:52:06.927]  Let's talk to Mike in Illinois.
[02:52:06.987 --> 02:52:07.667]  Mike, you're on the air.
[02:52:07.687 --> 02:52:08.087]  Go ahead.
[02:52:08.408 --> 02:52:09.268]  Yeah, hi, Alex.
[02:52:09.288 --> 02:52:12.990]  I really like your guest and everything you're saying, hitting on all the points.
[02:52:13.010 --> 02:52:16.111]  I want to say one thing to your guest, and I think you'll agree to this, Alex.
[02:52:17.129 --> 02:52:20.512]  We talk about the Bible, and I agree, we can slow this thing down.
[02:52:20.612 --> 02:52:25.035]  I think it's eminent that there's going to be massive destruction in the whole world, as the Bible talks about.
[02:52:25.055 --> 02:52:26.637]  But we can't slow it down.
[02:52:26.657 --> 02:52:35.484]  But the only thing I want to say is, if you read the Bible where Jesus talks about the wide path that leads to destruction, and many shall find it, and few shall find the straight and narrow path.
[02:52:35.524 --> 02:52:42.149]  And I believe what Jesus is saying there is that I think the Antichrist, as he says, is going to probably come out of the Middle East somewhere.
[02:52:42.885 --> 02:52:50.666]  And basically, all these so-called conservative Christians, these people that think Bush is God... No, it says they're going to worship him and say it's Christ.
[02:52:50.686 --> 02:52:52.187]  That's exactly what they're ready to do.
[02:52:52.427 --> 02:52:59.668]  And these are the ones... Israel's banned Christian proselytizing, and our Christian leaders actually get on TV and support it.
[02:53:00.168 --> 02:53:00.568]  Absolutely.
[02:53:00.588 --> 02:53:01.648]  These people are scum.
[02:53:02.268 --> 02:53:02.528]  They are.
[02:53:02.548 --> 02:53:04.309]  The problem is the fake Christians.
[02:53:05.009 --> 02:53:06.489]  Yep, and they're the ones that are going to follow it.
[02:53:06.569 --> 02:53:07.569]  And I moved, Alex.
[02:53:07.629 --> 02:53:08.709]  I moved away from Chicago.
[02:53:08.749 --> 02:53:12.010]  I'm about 150 miles in a rural town, and I moved because I'm preparing for...
[02:53:12.731 --> 02:53:13.131]  The future.
[02:53:13.151 --> 02:53:17.012]  I'm living in a small town here, but I'm away from everything, and I'm preparing for the worst thing.
[02:53:17.052 --> 02:53:20.693]  I wanted to get out of Chicago because a lot of stuff can go down in a big city.
[02:53:20.894 --> 02:53:21.414]  Good job.
[02:53:21.494 --> 02:53:24.435]  Yeah, we're looking to try to get out of the city of Austin, at least 30, 40 miles.
[02:53:24.495 --> 02:53:26.955]  I'm already on the edge of the town, but that's not good enough.
[02:53:26.975 --> 02:53:28.196]  This is a major target.
[02:53:29.056 --> 02:53:31.697]  You want to comment on that, Mr. O'Connor?
[02:53:32.237 --> 02:53:38.079]  Well, Jesus said in Luke 22, 35, to sell some of your clothes and buy a sword.
[02:53:38.639 --> 02:53:41.760]  So they can just go ahead and take that for what it's worth.
[02:53:42.304 --> 02:53:45.366]  Did you hear the big Air America host, Mike Malloy, say, buy guns?
[02:53:45.987 --> 02:53:52.411]  Oh, yeah, and you know, it's funny because I called Mike Malloy's show to expose the Bohemian Grove, and I was shocked.
[02:53:52.552 --> 02:53:53.873]  He knew exactly what it was.
[02:53:54.213 --> 02:53:57.936]  He didn't hang up on me and insult me, and we had a good chit-chat about it for a little while.
[02:53:58.376 --> 02:53:58.976]  Well, you heard him.
[02:53:59.016 --> 02:54:00.437]  He said he's had his whole paradigm shifted.
[02:54:00.457 --> 02:54:01.418]  That's happening right now.
[02:54:02.439 --> 02:54:03.620]  Look, you're in trouble.
[02:54:03.640 --> 02:54:06.822]  The liberals are all out buying semi-automatic rifles.
[02:54:07.663 --> 02:54:09.424]  Let's go ahead and talk to Mike in Kansas.
[02:54:09.484 --> 02:54:10.185]  Mike, you're on the air.
[02:54:10.205 --> 02:54:10.545]  Go ahead.
[02:54:12.819 --> 02:54:13.620]  Yes, go ahead.
[02:54:14.700 --> 02:54:15.400]  Hi, Alex.
[02:54:15.981 --> 02:54:17.081]  You guys are doing a good job.
[02:54:18.342 --> 02:54:26.225]  I kind of ran into a snag on some research I was doing, and hopefully other people will step forward with documentation.
[02:54:26.345 --> 02:54:28.326]  I'm missing what you're saying.
[02:54:28.426 --> 02:54:29.366]  We're getting short on time.
[02:54:29.386 --> 02:54:30.007]  What's going on?
[02:54:33.308 --> 02:54:39.010]  I wrote a paper, and I need more documentation on it, but it's on the web.
[02:54:39.070 --> 02:54:40.511]  It's called Warrantless By-
[02:54:43.050 --> 02:54:45.432]  Okay.
[02:54:46.552 --> 02:54:51.195]  Okay, we'll check it out, Mike.
[02:54:51.235 --> 02:54:51.656]  Thank you.
[02:54:52.236 --> 02:54:53.737]  Eric in Florida, you're on the air.
[02:54:53.777 --> 02:54:54.237]  Go ahead.
[02:54:55.098 --> 02:54:56.099]  Oh, hey, Alex.
[02:54:56.819 --> 02:54:57.019]  Yes.
[02:54:57.559 --> 02:54:59.140]  Hey, thanks for taking my call.
[02:54:59.201 --> 02:55:00.641]  I'll be as brief as possible.
[02:55:01.442 --> 02:55:04.224]  And I wanted to just point out that...
[02:55:05.475 --> 02:55:17.606]  There's a great website and an article called 200 Plus 9-11 Smoking Guns, and it's 12 pages, and it's a very cogent explanation of everything.
[02:55:17.646 --> 02:55:18.547]  Yeah, it's still down.
[02:55:18.587 --> 02:55:19.468]  We plug it all the time.
[02:55:19.588 --> 02:55:29.236]  Yeah, and what I'm doing is I'm taking that first page, and I'm making copies, and I'm putting down the windshields of all the cars in our grocery stores, and I'm suggesting that for everybody.
[02:55:29.276 --> 02:55:29.517]  Good.
[02:55:29.577 --> 02:55:30.157]  Keep it up.
[02:55:30.497 --> 02:55:30.998]  Keep it up.
[02:55:32.023 --> 02:55:32.624]  Resistance.
[02:55:32.864 --> 02:55:33.965]  TheResistanceManifesto.com.
[02:55:33.985 --> 02:55:35.906]  We've got a link to it on Infowars.com.
[02:55:36.466 --> 02:55:37.867]  John, thank you for coming on with us.
[02:55:38.328 --> 02:55:39.008]  Anytime.
[02:55:39.168 --> 02:55:44.693]  Terror Storm is a million-dollar budget-looking documentary that should be on the History Channel.
[02:55:45.033 --> 02:55:46.254]  Looks like the History Channel.
[02:55:46.274 --> 02:55:48.355]  Folks, don't take advantage of Alex.
[02:55:48.876 --> 02:55:50.777]  Don't just watch it on Google Video.
[02:55:50.897 --> 02:55:51.858]  Get the DVD.
[02:55:51.958 --> 02:55:54.060]  Support the man so he can keep up the fight.
[02:55:54.460 --> 02:55:55.621]  Power to the Resistance.
[02:55:55.981 --> 02:55:56.261]  Yes.
[02:55:56.421 --> 02:55:59.504]  Well, I didn't really plug videos today or anything.
[02:55:59.544 --> 02:56:01.285]  I've been so hyped up about what's happening, but...
[02:56:02.222 --> 02:56:07.504]  Yeah, there may come a time when you can't even get these folks, and people will really wake up if the enemy goes in the next phase.
[02:56:08.224 --> 02:56:10.685]  I mean, we're looking at, it could get real bad.
[02:56:11.506 --> 02:56:14.627]  But we planted so many seeds that the seeds of their destruction are there.
[02:56:15.147 --> 02:56:16.148]  We're going to win in the end.
[02:56:16.188 --> 02:56:17.028]  God's on our side.
[02:56:17.508 --> 02:56:18.289]  God bless you all.

[02:56:19.389 --> 02:56:21.050]  Back tomorrow, 11 to 2.
