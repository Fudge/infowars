[00:00:01.497 --> 00:00:04.519]  We're good to go.
[00:00:33.087 --> 00:00:36.728]  Fridays are always big, always informative.
[00:00:36.748 --> 00:00:39.989]  Three important guests for you.
[00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:42.269]  We have Clara Halpert joining us.
[00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:49.431]  They're having their family farm and business taken by the city government in her area.
[00:00:49.451 --> 00:00:51.511]  We'll tell you all about it coming up in 30 minutes.
[00:00:51.571 --> 00:00:54.232]  Because they, quote, want an open green space.
[00:00:54.272 --> 00:00:55.872]  They want a good view shed.
[00:00:57.142 --> 00:01:01.864]  The government is taking in and of course not giving them proper just compensation.
[00:01:01.985 --> 00:01:11.629]  Setting the trend, expanding the trend of open land grabbing by the government and the private criminal interest that have grown up around it.
[00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.351]  So that's coming up in 30 minutes.
[00:01:14.371 --> 00:01:20.394]  Then we're going to have Tommy Pallotta, the producer of A Scanner Darkly, the Philip K. Dick adaptation.
[00:01:21.617 --> 00:01:26.842]  That is getting rave reviews from the Cannes Film Festival to right here in the United States.
[00:01:27.543 --> 00:01:44.138]  He'll be joining us to talk about this near future police state dystopic film that opens in most major cities this weekend and then in hundreds of theaters in the next few weeks and then over a thousand screens by the time it is fully released in the next month.
[00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:49.431]  Tommy Pallotta will be joining us coming up in 30 minutes in the next hour.
[00:01:49.971 --> 00:01:56.155]  Richard Linkletter joins us on the 11th, coming up early next week.
[00:01:56.195 --> 00:01:57.155]  The director of the film.
[00:01:57.195 --> 00:02:02.819]  He also has Fast Food Nation coming out, exposing that travesty.
[00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:06.301]  And so he'll be on the air with us talking about both of those films.
[00:02:06.341 --> 00:02:10.303]  The double barrel approach, as one critic called it, from the Texan.
[00:02:10.983 --> 00:02:13.405]  Richard Linkletter coming up next week.
[00:02:13.445 --> 00:02:14.426]  Well, what is the 11th?
[00:02:14.907 --> 00:02:18.810]  I guess that will be on Tuesday.
[00:02:20.111 --> 00:02:23.954]  Of course, today is 7-7.
[00:02:23.974 --> 00:02:32.361]  7-7, the one year anniversary of the British government carrying out terror attacks in London.
[00:02:32.862 --> 00:02:36.625]  They then had another dud attack two weeks later on 7-21.
[00:02:41.132 --> 00:02:52.398]  And my new film, Terror Storm, spends, I guess, about 40 minutes of the just shy of two hours on the London bombing, on the ground in London.
[00:02:52.778 --> 00:02:58.321]  We were there just a week and a half after 7-7 in the middle of the government operation.
[00:03:02.219 --> 00:03:02.879]  I think we're good to go.
[00:03:25.169 --> 00:03:26.069]  We're good to go.
[00:03:26.089 --> 00:03:26.249]  I think?
[00:03:48.975 --> 00:03:51.056]  And start making copies and getting them out to people.
[00:03:51.076 --> 00:03:56.478]  We just can't wait a month until the extras are done and the official DVD is all printed up with the pretty color cover.
[00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:58.039]  We're putting it out now.
[00:03:58.399 --> 00:04:05.222]  And I hope you'll visit Infowars.com, the secure video and bookstore, and get a copy of Terror Storm and some of the other books and videos while you're at it.
[00:04:05.602 --> 00:04:08.964]  Or I sincerely hope that you will call toll-free to secure your copy.
[00:04:08.984 --> 00:04:09.604]  1-888-253-3139.
[00:04:09.644 --> 00:04:10.244]  Terror Storm.
[00:04:10.264 --> 00:04:11.465]  11 months in the making.
[00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:19.860]  We're good to go.
[00:04:48.849 --> 00:04:54.737]  The emergency edition, collector's edition, is only available for a limited time.
[00:04:54.797 --> 00:04:55.738]  Get your copy now.
[00:04:56.018 --> 00:05:00.224]  You can see it online right now at prisonplanet.tv.
[00:05:02.126 --> 00:05:04.990]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[00:05:05.718 --> 00:05:06.999]  Alex Jones here, America.
[00:05:07.219 --> 00:05:12.942]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest, most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[00:05:13.222 --> 00:05:18.485]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[00:05:18.765 --> 00:05:22.947]  Brace yourselves as the New World Order program for world domination is blown wide open.
[00:05:23.107 --> 00:05:26.869]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world where the military and the police are merged.
[00:05:27.149 --> 00:05:31.752]  Witnesses' populations beg for national ID cards and, yes, even implantable microchips.
[00:05:31.852 --> 00:05:38.113]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies, psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.
[00:05:38.153 --> 00:05:40.034]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.
[00:05:40.474 --> 00:05:42.554]  Order 911 The Road to Terry today.
[00:05:42.634 --> 00:05:46.915]  Call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[00:05:46.995 --> 00:05:49.036]  That's 1-888-253-3139.
[00:05:49.776 --> 00:05:54.157]  Or order online at infowars.com or infowars.net.
[00:05:54.277 --> 00:05:56.297]  You see big brothers afraid of this documentary.
[00:05:56.497 --> 00:05:58.017]  Order today and spread the word.
[00:05:58.198 --> 00:06:00.278]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.
[00:06:01.258 --> 00:06:04.521]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[00:06:04.601 --> 00:06:08.784]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[00:06:09.024 --> 00:06:11.807]  But if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[00:06:12.007 --> 00:06:14.409]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[00:06:14.589 --> 00:06:23.236]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[00:06:23.436 --> 00:06:24.777]  The Berkey Light is different.
[00:06:24.978 --> 00:06:29.121]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[00:06:30.921 --> 00:06:43.363]  This allows the proprietary media formulation to remove and reduce pathogenic bacteria, cysts, chemicals, herbicides, pesticides, organic solvents, foul tastes, odors, heavy metals, and nitrates.
[00:06:43.563 --> 00:06:50.125]  It is so powerful it purifies raw, untreated water from remote lakes, streams, and stagnant ponds.
[00:06:50.325 --> 00:06:53.205]  Get the Advanced Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:06:58.266 --> 00:06:59.492]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:06.293]  Dry cracked heels used to be a real problem for me, especially in the summer when I wear sandals.
[00:07:06.553 --> 00:07:09.154]  My husband would say, your heels are like sandpaper.
[00:07:09.574 --> 00:07:12.155]  But then my podiatrist gave me Calix Ointment.
[00:07:12.495 --> 00:07:17.478]  It's diabetic friendly and smooths cracked heels and calluses using natural enzymes.
[00:07:17.718 --> 00:07:21.240]  Calix never stings or burns and made my heels baby soft.
[00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:23.141]  Now they look and feel great.
[00:07:23.481 --> 00:07:26.962]  If you have calluses or dry cracked heels, try Calix Ointment.
[00:07:27.283 --> 00:07:30.184]  You can find it at Walgreens and Longs in the foot care section.
[00:07:31.636 --> 00:07:34.117]  Are your Federal Reserve notes looking for a safe haven?
[00:07:34.577 --> 00:07:36.478]  Mine found it in precious metals.
[00:07:37.199 --> 00:07:40.380]  Not paper promises, but actual gold in my possession.
[00:07:41.021 --> 00:07:47.504]  It is liquid, it is private, it owes no one, it cannot go bankrupt, and it maintains its purchasing power.
[00:07:48.284 --> 00:07:50.485]  Find your answer at Midas Resources.
[00:07:50.865 --> 00:07:51.085]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:07:51.105 --> 00:07:51.566]  The answer is at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:08:02.569 --> 00:08:08.591]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:09.211 --> 00:08:12.251]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:25.895 --> 00:08:30.676]  There's a lot of things that have been happening in the last month that we haven't really focused in on properly.
[00:08:32.333 --> 00:08:40.295]  Of course, today is the anniversary, the one-year anniversary of the British government-sponsored terror, 7-7, in London.
[00:08:40.375 --> 00:08:45.257]  We did the most detailed reportage anywhere at prisonplanet.com and infowars.com.
[00:08:45.277 --> 00:08:48.518]  We happen to have correspondents, of course, in Sheffield and London.
[00:08:50.278 --> 00:08:58.881]  And now a lot of people are on record, former MI5 agents, even members of the Parliament, questioning 7-7 and showing that all the evidence points towards it being an inside job.
[00:08:59.545 --> 00:09:03.726]  The majority of Brits in polls, over 80% believe the government killed Diana.
[00:09:03.766 --> 00:09:05.127]  The evidence of that has come out.
[00:09:05.527 --> 00:09:11.529]  The majority of Brits in major polls and now even members of Parliament are pointing directly towards Dr. David Kelly being killed.
[00:09:12.029 --> 00:09:20.032]  We have a clip from one of their national newscasts that I want to play concerning the murder of Dr. David Kelly where it's openly now being discussed.
[00:09:20.052 --> 00:09:21.352]  And again, it's the same thing on 7-7.
[00:09:22.053 --> 00:09:23.353]  That is being exposed.
[00:09:24.668 --> 00:09:34.771]  So we've seen governments shift from carrying out actual terror attacks, which they blame on their political enemies and they use as a pretext for setting up ever-widening, expanding police states.
[00:09:35.231 --> 00:09:46.554]  We've seen a shift from that now to fear-mongering, fake terror busts with chemical weapons that turns out to be completely staged, now admitted to be staged, in London a month ago.
[00:09:47.543 --> 00:09:57.150]  Days later, in Canada, a staged event with a bunch of teenagers with a royal amount of police shipping them thousands of pounds of fertilizer and saying they were planning to blow everything up.
[00:09:58.371 --> 00:10:01.534]  Lots of fake videos of terrorists on the news saying they're going to get us.
[00:10:02.845 --> 00:10:03.626]  It's ridiculous.
[00:10:03.666 --> 00:10:31.421]  We saw the situation in Florida a few weeks ago where it is, again, now even admitted in mainstream news that the whole thing was a fraud, a staged sting, where the government literally went on the streets and openly recruited, created the supposed terror organization made up of a bunch of low-grade morons, paid them over $50,000 cash, set them up in a warehouse, and then videotaped them swearing allegiance to Al-Qaeda, being led by the FBI informant,
[00:10:32.654 --> 00:10:36.056]  It's the same story over and over and over again.
[00:10:36.457 --> 00:10:42.481]  And now, fresh on the heels of that, FBI disrupts New York City tunnel plot.
[00:10:42.981 --> 00:10:50.447]  Authorities have disrupted planning for foreign terrorists for an attack on the transportation network including tunnels in the New York City, New Jersey area.
[00:10:50.487 --> 00:10:51.948]  Two federal agencies announced Friday.
[00:10:52.839 --> 00:11:03.328]  And of course, five months ago in Ohio, they supposedly busted a shell of terrorists who were planning to kill everyone, and it turns out that they were too being led by a member of the U.S.
[00:11:03.548 --> 00:11:09.673]  military special forces who was working for the National Security Council, and they staged that entire event.
[00:11:10.533 --> 00:11:13.596]  We have disrupted a terrorist network that was...
[00:11:14.893 --> 00:11:32.746]  In the planning stages of an attack, said a statement released jointly and mid-morning by the FBI and Department of Homeland Security, FBI agents monitoring Internet chat rooms used by extremists learned in recent months of a plot to strike a blow at the city's economy by destroying vital transportation networks, an official said earlier.
[00:11:33.547 --> 00:11:43.034]  Now, there are real nuts and a few real kooks and killers that do shoot their mouths off about carrying out these type of dastardly, horrific attacks.
[00:11:44.045 --> 00:11:48.087]  But, and we've researched this, we've seen this over and over again, the same signature.
[00:11:48.528 --> 00:12:03.997]  Normally it's FBI, CIA, Shin Bet, Mossad, MI6, MI5, German intelligence or private agencies online simply writing Al-Qaeda confessions online, posting admissions, posting audio tapes.
[00:12:04.357 --> 00:12:05.077]  They're checked out.
[00:12:05.117 --> 00:12:06.378]  They're proved to be frauds.
[00:12:06.798 --> 00:12:13.182]  The globalists are show sloppy that it always leads back to neocon-owned servers and companies.
[00:12:14.526 --> 00:12:18.467]  Out of Arizona, Texas, New York, New Jersey.
[00:12:19.827 --> 00:12:21.108]  Did I mention Arkansas?
[00:12:22.148 --> 00:12:23.488]  So it's the same thing over and over again.
[00:12:23.928 --> 00:12:27.349]  I mean, literally, the government can go on any chat room, any message board.
[00:12:27.629 --> 00:12:29.650]  They can say they want to carry out terror attacks.
[00:12:30.030 --> 00:12:33.070]  Then some other agent from another agency agrees with them.
[00:12:34.211 --> 00:12:35.331]  They then go bust.
[00:12:35.391 --> 00:12:38.111]  It's always a low-grade moron or someone who's mentally retarded.
[00:12:38.131 --> 00:12:40.352]  They claim that they were the main person planning it.
[00:12:42.563 --> 00:12:44.564]  Now several things could be happening here.
[00:12:44.764 --> 00:12:46.645]  And I don't know which one.
[00:12:46.925 --> 00:12:50.067]  I don't know what the globalists are going to do because I don't think they know what they're going to do.
[00:12:50.788 --> 00:12:59.753]  They've got a whole bunch of different simultaneous plans and operations going side by side that they can implement either one at a time or all together at the same time.
[00:13:02.434 --> 00:13:05.576]  Now again, the globalists can't carry out another 9-11 in the U.S.
[00:13:07.897 --> 00:13:09.558]  There's a few things that
[00:13:10.274 --> 00:13:11.795]  That will make it look bad if they do.
[00:13:11.856 --> 00:13:12.916]  Now, I'm not saying they can't.
[00:13:12.956 --> 00:13:22.185]  I'm saying they can't do it without people saying, oh, you took a bunch of our freedoms and set up a police state, and now look, it's your fault.
[00:13:23.285 --> 00:13:25.868]  The terrorists were still able to attack us.
[00:13:26.068 --> 00:13:27.229]  Oh, you really screwed up.
[00:13:27.269 --> 00:13:28.330]  You can't keep us safe.
[00:13:29.768 --> 00:13:39.355]  But if they lead up to, and I've said a key indicator of major terror attacks in the United States or Western Europe or North America, will be a whole bunch of bust.
[00:13:39.576 --> 00:13:40.736]  Oh, we foiled this attack.
[00:13:40.997 --> 00:13:41.997]  We foiled this attack.
[00:13:42.037 --> 00:13:43.078]  We foiled that attack.
[00:13:43.118 --> 00:13:44.259]  We foiled another attack.
[00:13:44.539 --> 00:13:46.341]  We're doing everything we can to keep you safe.
[00:13:46.641 --> 00:13:49.203]  And then, oh my gosh, one slip past us, there was another.
[00:13:49.483 --> 00:13:58.766]  There was a truck bomb, or there was a dirty bomb, or an A-bomb went off, and we think Iran did it, or somebody released a new bio-weapon that came out of left field.
[00:13:58.786 --> 00:13:59.986]  We don't know where it came from.
[00:14:00.026 --> 00:14:07.468]  And all the microbiologists that could have identified where it came from all mysteriously died in the last three years.
[00:14:10.229 --> 00:14:10.629]  You see?
[00:14:11.649 --> 00:14:17.491]  So, a whole bunch of attacks being foiled is a major indicator that...
[00:14:18.559 --> 00:14:19.220]  We're good to go.
[00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:19.540]  I think?
[00:14:40.883 --> 00:14:44.145]  And so they frustrated our operation.
[00:14:44.185 --> 00:14:46.687]  They stopped us from being able to save you.
[00:14:46.747 --> 00:14:48.228]  And so it's also their fault.
[00:14:48.528 --> 00:14:51.390]  It's the people that stopped us from protecting you.
[00:14:51.450 --> 00:14:51.990]  It's their fault.
[00:14:52.859 --> 00:14:58.320]  And I've heard Michael Savage and many others chortle and laugh that just wait until there's another terror attack.
[00:14:58.380 --> 00:15:00.621]  It's going to be all of you's faults out there.
[00:15:01.041 --> 00:15:06.242]  It's going to be your fault, those of you that stopped us from setting up the security we needed.
[00:15:06.322 --> 00:15:15.425]  And now we're going to have to ban the press criticizing Homeland Security and ban the press criticizing the police state because it's here to keep you safe.
[00:15:15.485 --> 00:15:16.845]  And we notice Fox News and
[00:15:17.125 --> 00:15:22.787]  Everybody else is beating that drum for a new office of censorship and not allowing criticism of the government.
[00:15:22.827 --> 00:15:34.191]  In California, Deputy Attorney General is going back four years ago, Calhoun, saying that anti-war protests should be banned because anti-war protests aid the terrorists.
[00:15:35.292 --> 00:15:41.514]  The war is against terrorists, and so anti-war protests hurt the war effort, hence they help the terrorists.
[00:15:44.035 --> 00:15:44.575]  I mean, even...
[00:15:45.942 --> 00:15:49.988]  Even Democrats, when they're in office, are out here pushing this and using this.
[00:15:51.029 --> 00:16:01.484]  Or the globalists could have been basically exposed, which we know they have to a great extent, on 9-11, on 7-7, on Madrid, on a host of other government false flag terror attacks.
[00:16:03.780 --> 00:16:11.162]  And so what we could be seeing here is they're simply trying to carry out basically drills.
[00:16:11.222 --> 00:16:18.584]  We know that the live drills they've had do create a climate of fear, hysteria, the perception that we're being attacked by terror attacks.
[00:16:18.664 --> 00:16:29.587]  Well, these fake terror busts, they serve kind of the medium between drills, which create a climate of fear and the government saving you by taking your rights,
[00:16:30.067 --> 00:16:39.550]  And real terror attacks which have been extremely effective in destroying our republic and delivering us into the hands of the American Union and the New World Order.
[00:16:40.951 --> 00:16:42.111]  So I don't know which it is.
[00:16:42.131 --> 00:16:53.415]  I don't know if they're carrying out these fake terror raids just to put the image out that they're saving us, they're protecting us, it's a summer of fear leading into the election, this climate of hysteria.
[00:16:54.102 --> 00:17:01.105]  To smoke screen all the other corruption and bid rigging and war profiteering and criminal activities that are going on.
[00:17:01.565 --> 00:17:02.786]  That's on the good hand.
[00:17:03.386 --> 00:17:07.648]  We hope that they've decided to back off carrying out terror attacks in the Western world.
[00:17:07.988 --> 00:17:12.290]  We hope that they've backed off that program because they've been penetrated and exposed.
[00:17:12.851 --> 00:17:15.912]  But I tend to lean towards, at least currently,
[00:17:16.533 --> 00:17:16.933]  Also, different...
[00:17:46.687 --> 00:17:47.268]  We're good to go.
[00:17:47.288 --> 00:17:47.448]  I think?
[00:18:06.232 --> 00:18:06.452]  I think?
[00:18:32.879 --> 00:18:37.121]  The government is actually calling for blanket total amnesty and open borders.
[00:18:37.381 --> 00:18:44.424]  They tried to sell the lie that the amnesty program was actually a pro-sovereignty, anti-illegal alien move.
[00:18:44.484 --> 00:18:45.464]  It's the complete opposite.
[00:18:45.944 --> 00:18:47.925]  So the globalists also have that problem.
[00:18:48.185 --> 00:19:01.731]  That if they carry out another attack, even more people will say, wait a minute, you left our borders wide open, but you've got TSA-trained Viper teams in Miami, Dallas, and other cities randomly...
[00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:05.722]  Searching American citizens at shopping malls.
[00:19:06.882 --> 00:19:11.584]  You see, what you live under in the airports will soon be on the streets of America.
[00:19:11.605 --> 00:19:15.406]  In fact, it's here the FBI said they want checkpoints going into shopping malls.
[00:19:15.707 --> 00:19:21.449]  Yeah, leave the gates of the city open, but let's have everyone basically with their hands up inside their homes.
[00:19:22.570 --> 00:19:23.410]  This is what's happened.
[00:19:23.450 --> 00:19:26.472]  So, critical crossroads right now.
[00:19:28.405 --> 00:19:32.787]  The neocon agenda is sliding backwards, is in flames.
[00:19:33.268 --> 00:19:35.749]  They need terror attacks to jumpstart it.
[00:19:36.489 --> 00:19:43.473]  But their statisticians, their experts, their theoreticians are telling them it may blow up in their face, literally and figuratively.
[00:19:44.034 --> 00:19:45.254]  Too many people are watching.
[00:19:45.514 --> 00:19:49.356]  Too many police, mid and low level, are aware of what's really going on.
[00:19:49.376 --> 00:19:50.637]  There's too many whistleblowers.
[00:19:50.877 --> 00:19:52.178]  They're worried about going public.
[00:19:52.944 --> 00:19:54.845]  So, is it really just the summer of fear?
[00:19:55.125 --> 00:19:58.487]  Lots of fake terror busts to make us think they're saving us.
[00:20:01.409 --> 00:20:09.934]  According to a recent report by the National Institute of Health, high blood pressure is a major risk factor for heart disease and the chief risk factor for stroke and heart failure.
[00:20:10.154 --> 00:20:11.975]  It affects about 50 million Americans.
[00:20:12.175 --> 00:20:13.316]  That's one in four adults.
[00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:14.220]  We're good to go.
[00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:14.440]  I think?
[00:20:35.493 --> 00:20:40.836]  The widely researched natural herbal supplements for regulating blood pressure and maintaining optimum heart health.
[00:20:41.156 --> 00:20:47.239]  Did you know that the safety and effectiveness of heart care is backed by over 100 clinical trials and experimental studies?
[00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:48.080]  Act now.

[00:21:06.781 --> 00:21:07.502]  We're good to go.
[00:21:31.417 --> 00:21:32.298]  Here is reality.
[00:21:32.658 --> 00:21:36.261]  The devaluation of currency equals real inflation.
[00:21:36.721 --> 00:21:40.404]  Keep in mind how the value of your paper assets are measured in dollars.
[00:21:40.964 --> 00:21:44.707]  Gold in this same time frame increased 35% in value.
[00:21:45.147 --> 00:21:48.850]  Learn how to protect and profit in this truly unstable world economy.

[00:22:38.906 --> 00:22:43.370]  The Berkey Light's rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.

[00:23:56.910 --> 00:23:59.291]  Create the Dream is a division of the Creative Concepts
[00:24:01.567 --> 00:24:07.191]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:13.815 --> 00:24:25.123]  Ron Paul is scheduled, popping in sometime in the third hour today, Congressman Ron Paul, Dr. Ron Paul, Tommy Pallotta, the producer, along with, of course...
[00:24:26.897 --> 00:24:27.738]  We're good to go.
[00:24:27.758 --> 00:24:27.898]  I think?
[00:24:50.537 --> 00:25:05.988]  Who died on 9-11, and he's the leader of one of the major family groups, and they're starting to have a lot of questions about 9-11, so he'll be joining us coming up at the bottom of the next hour, so about roughly about an hour and five minutes from now.
[00:25:06.088 --> 00:25:08.189]  So, wow, how many guests is that today?
[00:25:08.229 --> 00:25:13.873]  And it's all really important stuff, so you'll want to stay with us for the entire broadcast if you can.
[00:25:16.784 --> 00:25:23.407]  Interspersed, I have the news of global warming really being hyped, being pushed, even if you believe in global warming.
[00:25:24.447 --> 00:25:27.509]  Their, quote, solutions is nothing more than a global tax and a fraud.
[00:25:28.089 --> 00:25:29.650]  I want to try to spend some time on that.
[00:25:30.490 --> 00:25:35.632]  The mysterious death of Ken Lay as he waited for his sentencing up in Colorado.
[00:25:35.652 --> 00:25:42.916]  A few days after his death, Colin Powell, having dinner with the Clintons, has to go to the hospital, at the very same hospital.
[00:25:42.936 --> 00:25:43.836]  A lot of mysterious...
[00:25:44.525 --> 00:25:45.646]  Things going on there.
[00:25:46.266 --> 00:25:52.349]  Turns out the North Korean missile was aimed at an area off of the Hawaiian Islands.
[00:25:52.929 --> 00:25:59.633]  Of course, what, almost, what, over five years ago, a North Korean test missile did hit Alaska, a dummy warhead.
[00:25:59.653 --> 00:26:12.519]  And that was covered up quickly because you can't be invading Iraq a few years later if you're claiming there's such a threat while there's an actual country run by a madman firing missiles, test missiles, at the United States.
[00:26:14.728 --> 00:26:19.110]  So that's the type of news I have stacked up here in front of me today.
[00:26:21.412 --> 00:26:25.974]  No way to cover all of it properly, but we will attempt to do it.
[00:26:26.675 --> 00:26:30.197]  I might as well put one plug in for this and then leave it at that.
[00:26:30.277 --> 00:26:32.938]  We've got about 150 t-shirts left.
[00:26:34.279 --> 00:26:38.321]  That was how many we had, 156 to be precise, yesterday when I posted it.
[00:26:38.721 --> 00:26:39.302]  We made 600 of these.
[00:26:41.119 --> 00:26:44.401]  It is 9-11 and the Neocon Agenda with the incredible artwork on the front.
[00:26:44.421 --> 00:26:46.163]  You can see it at InfoWars.com.
[00:26:46.763 --> 00:26:51.006]  We only have a few larges, extra larges, XX larges.
[00:26:52.247 --> 00:26:56.269]  And as different sizes are sold out, we'll remove those.
[00:26:56.850 --> 00:27:03.074]  If you want one of these t-shirts, it says Face the Facts, InfoWars.com, PrisonPundit.com on the back.
[00:27:03.534 --> 00:27:05.676]  On the front, 9-11 and the Neocon Agenda.
[00:27:07.896 --> 00:27:11.419]  Two Days of Truth, June 24th, 25th, LA.
[00:27:12.100 --> 00:27:13.981]  And when those 150 are gone, they're gone.
[00:27:14.001 --> 00:27:15.142]  We're not printing anymore.
[00:27:15.543 --> 00:27:18.045]  If you want one of these, it's a great way to get the word out.
[00:27:18.465 --> 00:27:19.386]  And it's a collector's item.
[00:27:19.426 --> 00:27:20.166]  It was historical.
[00:27:20.186 --> 00:27:26.632]  If you went and didn't get a t-shirt, or you didn't have a chance to go, and you want the t-shirt, they're on Infowars.com right now.
[00:27:26.672 --> 00:27:30.835]  And I would predict by Monday, they should probably all be gone.
[00:27:31.996 --> 00:27:32.377]  And yes...
[00:27:34.548 --> 00:27:40.555]  I printed up, I guess, about 1,100 DVDs, the emergency release of Terror Storm without the extras.
[00:27:40.955 --> 00:27:45.040]  And the final film is about four and a half minutes shorter, so it also has some footage that's been cut.
[00:27:45.580 --> 00:27:48.403]  It says 9-11 Neocon Agenda at the beginning of the film.
[00:27:48.824 --> 00:27:49.905]  It is a collector's edition.
[00:27:49.965 --> 00:27:51.667]  I'm signing every copy that's left.
[00:27:52.187 --> 00:27:54.390]  They are very close to all being gone.
[00:27:55.669 --> 00:28:07.172]  And we have those available at InfoWars.com, or you can write to us right now and get one as well, or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139, 888-253-3139, or write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[00:28:07.293 --> 00:28:11.714]  We're holding back some in case we sell out for those that do send in mail orders.
[00:28:25.798 --> 00:28:36.656]  So if we get those mail orders in the next week or so, or if it's posted in the next week or so, you will be able to get a collector's edition of the emergency release of Terror Storm.
[00:28:36.937 --> 00:28:37.678]  I was going to wait.
[00:28:38.869 --> 00:28:41.191]  But it's going to take like a month to have these out officially.
[00:28:41.612 --> 00:28:42.933]  And I thought, why have I had these?
[00:28:42.993 --> 00:28:43.914]  Why not get these out?
[00:28:44.274 --> 00:28:44.895]  Please get them.
[00:28:45.015 --> 00:28:45.815]  Please make copies.
[00:28:45.855 --> 00:28:46.636]  We cannot wait.
[00:28:46.916 --> 00:28:49.879]  We've got to expose the globalists that carried out 9-11.
[00:28:50.139 --> 00:28:53.562]  The film gets into London bombings and prisons and inside job.
[00:28:53.622 --> 00:28:55.204]  A whole history of government-sponsored terror.
[00:28:55.965 --> 00:28:59.688]  Before that, and then we get into the fake war, how they staged that.
[00:29:00.008 --> 00:29:02.851]  British SAS dressed up attacking Basra police.
[00:29:03.651 --> 00:29:04.392]  Being captured.
[00:29:04.432 --> 00:29:05.372]  That was all staged.
[00:29:05.713 --> 00:29:07.054]  A whole bunch of issues like that.
[00:29:07.074 --> 00:29:08.094]  The Downing Street memo.
[00:29:08.374 --> 00:29:09.335]  The White House memo.
[00:29:09.355 --> 00:29:10.115]  We go to Crawford.
[00:29:10.135 --> 00:29:13.438]  We show all the lunacy of the neocons who are anything but conservative.
[00:29:13.778 --> 00:29:19.581]  We interview Ray McGovern, Cindy Sheehan, MI5 agents Andy Michon and David Shaler.
[00:29:20.002 --> 00:29:23.264]  A member of Parliament, former Blair cabinet member, Michael Meacher.
[00:29:24.224 --> 00:29:29.448]  Professor Stephen Jones, Dr. Morgan Reynolds, the list goes on and on.
[00:29:29.508 --> 00:29:30.829]  It's the best film ever made.
[00:29:31.189 --> 00:29:32.670]  It is heads above all the others.
[00:29:32.710 --> 00:29:33.451]  The others are excellent.
[00:29:33.911 --> 00:29:36.733]  So visit InfoWars.com and get Terror Storm.
[00:29:36.753 --> 00:29:39.035]  Get a few of the other films and get them out to people now.
[00:29:39.095 --> 00:29:43.558]  We've got to expose the criminals that carried out 9-11 that are going to carry out more attacks.
[00:29:44.579 --> 00:29:45.820]  You can also see it on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:29:51.698 --> 00:29:52.599]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.100 --> 00:29:54.682]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.623 --> 00:29:58.306]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:03.152 --> 00:30:09.519]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[00:30:09.900 --> 00:30:14.585]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using rife frequency technology.
[00:30:14.925 --> 00:30:22.494]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Wright discovered that disease organisms could be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:30:22.894 --> 00:30:29.757]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:30:29.977 --> 00:30:31.377]  There are no side effects.
[00:30:31.697 --> 00:30:35.339]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[00:30:35.619 --> 00:30:42.622]  BioSolutions has over 550 programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.

[00:30:49.748 --> 00:30:50.108]  That's 866-885-6625.
[00:30:50.148 --> 00:30:51.010]  Once again, that's 866-885-6625.
[00:31:01.593 --> 00:31:03.193]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:31:03.333 --> 00:31:07.434]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[00:31:07.575 --> 00:31:10.455]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[00:31:10.535 --> 00:31:17.257]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[00:31:17.437 --> 00:31:20.438]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[00:31:20.638 --> 00:31:23.018]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[00:31:23.158 --> 00:31:25.279]  Black Berkey elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria,
[00:31:25.299 --> 00:31:33.826]  Supercharge your gravity filter today and order a two-pack of Black Berkey Purification Elements for only $96 or a four-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at 888-
[00:31:52.381 --> 00:31:52.501]  803-4438.
[00:31:52.541 --> 00:31:52.862]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:32:03.486 --> 00:32:05.607]  Hey, Bill, I'm buying lunch today.
[00:32:05.927 --> 00:32:06.747]  And check this out.
[00:32:07.067 --> 00:32:07.967]  I bought a new car.
[00:32:08.047 --> 00:32:13.268]  Wow, John, I guess you took my advice and visited that website we were talking about over lunch last time we met.
[00:32:13.849 --> 00:32:17.989]  www.didyourobbillgates.com I did, and you were right.
[00:32:18.309 --> 00:32:23.210]  I learned how to make $3,000 to $9,000 each and every week, starting with my very first week.
[00:32:23.630 --> 00:32:26.071]  And it's a simple program that does all the work for you.
[00:32:26.391 --> 00:32:29.732]  I'm already up to $25,000 just going on my fifth week.
[00:32:29.972 --> 00:32:30.872]  Whoa, that's awesome!
[00:32:31.232 --> 00:32:33.613]  John, your business will keep growing as mine has.
[00:32:33.973 --> 00:32:36.234]  In fact, people are joining from all over the world.
[00:32:36.334 --> 00:32:37.014]  It's incredible.
[00:32:37.374 --> 00:32:44.836]  Everyone should go to www.DidYouRobBillGates.com and learn how this program can help them become financially independent, too.
[00:32:45.176 --> 00:32:50.118]  Thanks a million, Bill, for telling me about www.DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[00:32:50.718 --> 00:32:51.398]  Check, please.
[00:32:51.859 --> 00:32:52.759]  I got this one, Bill.
[00:32:53.159 --> 00:32:53.839]  Sure, John.
[00:32:53.979 --> 00:32:58.581]  Let's tell everyone about www.DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[00:32:58.721 --> 00:32:58.981]  Deal.
[00:33:08.599 --> 00:33:19.169]  Of course, you remember the new London, Connecticut ruling of last year, where they ruled that they don't even have to give just compensation.
[00:33:19.189 --> 00:33:20.991]  That's the thing the media didn't like to focus on.
[00:33:21.051 --> 00:33:30.881]  It was in the local papers that they come in to say a $306,000 house in one of the cases, and they say, we've already condemned it, even though it's a three-story Victorian home on the water.
[00:33:31.924 --> 00:33:34.366]  And you're paying on the tax rolls over $300,000.
[00:33:34.847 --> 00:33:36.388]  You could clearly sell it for more than that.
[00:33:36.708 --> 00:33:38.090]  We're condemning it.
[00:33:38.110 --> 00:33:41.072]  We're going to give you $61,000 for it.
[00:33:41.532 --> 00:33:46.036]  And by the way, since you fought us in court, we're going to charge you back rent for the five-year fight.
[00:33:46.397 --> 00:33:48.498]  So you actually owe us $40,000.
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:51.661]  So that's what really happened there.
[00:33:51.681 --> 00:33:54.604]  And then we have the Western Seafood.
[00:33:55.104 --> 00:33:58.247]  There's hundreds of these cases in Freeport, Texas.
[00:33:59.185 --> 00:34:00.646]  Set up in 1942.
[00:34:01.166 --> 00:34:03.528]  They make over $40-plus million a year profit.
[00:34:03.548 --> 00:34:04.549]  That's been in the Houston Chronicle.
[00:34:04.569 --> 00:34:09.812]  We had Mr. Gore, three-generation owner of it on the air.
[00:34:09.852 --> 00:34:16.717]  They're not even trying to give them just compensation, all because the heir of the mobile oil fortune wants it for a yacht club.
[00:34:16.897 --> 00:34:17.878]  Folks, I'm not kidding.
[00:34:20.114 --> 00:34:21.475]  So this is how it operates.
[00:34:21.495 --> 00:34:24.836]  They say a private interest want your land, and they're allowed to go lobby.
[00:34:24.856 --> 00:34:26.037]  This is in the Supreme Court ruling.
[00:34:26.517 --> 00:34:31.259]  They're allowed to go lobby your city council, your county commissioners, your legislature, your state legislature.
[00:34:31.599 --> 00:34:34.000]  They are allowed to then take your property if they decide.
[00:34:34.040 --> 00:34:37.241]  It makes your locals absolute kings, absolute rulers.
[00:34:38.682 --> 00:34:43.804]  This is something out of Britain 600, 700 years ago, France 500 years ago.
[00:34:44.344 --> 00:34:45.665]  I mean, this is out of the Dark Ages.
[00:34:46.152 --> 00:34:47.333]  We're good to go.
[00:34:47.433 --> 00:34:47.854]  We're good to go.
[00:35:09.042 --> 00:35:10.203]  So this is what we face.
[00:35:10.483 --> 00:35:12.424]  And every day I see these, okay?
[00:35:12.845 --> 00:35:14.206]  I can't make the whole show about this.
[00:35:14.386 --> 00:35:15.787]  Every day I read about this.
[00:35:15.847 --> 00:35:18.008]  But here's a particularly egregious case.
[00:35:18.028 --> 00:35:22.811]  We're going to go to Clara Halper in just a minute from Piscataway, New Jersey.
[00:35:24.052 --> 00:35:26.714]  Family plans protest over eminent domain eviction.
[00:35:27.739 --> 00:35:32.021]  Facing eviction from their 75-acre Piscataway farm at 3 p.m.
[00:35:32.501 --> 00:35:39.923]  next Monday, the Halpert family plans to hold rallies protesting the eminent domain ruling that will force them from their home and businesses.
[00:35:40.424 --> 00:35:49.507]  Some people will arrive Saturday and will plan to have rallies on Sunday and Monday afternoon, said Clara Halpert, who's on the line with us, wife of Larry Halpert, whose family owns the farm.
[00:35:50.336 --> 00:35:53.797]  On the corner of South Washington Avenue and Mathers Lane.
[00:35:54.297 --> 00:35:57.858]  And some estimates have the land tagged between $20 and $100 plus million.
[00:35:59.199 --> 00:36:02.600]  The city is trying to pay them, according to press reports, almost nothing.
[00:36:03.080 --> 00:36:07.182]  They want a jury ruling of $18 million.
[00:36:07.622 --> 00:36:09.922]  They don't want to sell the family farm and land.
[00:36:10.102 --> 00:36:10.983]  There's a business on it.
[00:36:11.243 --> 00:36:13.464]  Quote, there'll be people who oppose them at domain laws.
[00:36:13.504 --> 00:36:14.564]  We'll have some people speak.
[00:36:15.257 --> 00:36:17.678]  As of Wednesday, the rallies have not yet been scheduled.
[00:36:18.058 --> 00:36:28.760]  The Halpert family and Piscataway Township have been locked in a bitter dispute since the fall of 1999 over the farm that the township has seized under eminent domain laws for the purpose of open space preservation.
[00:36:29.100 --> 00:36:39.223]  But under that, and it's in the news here in front of me, under that it says that the city can then give it or sell it to whoever they want for development.
[00:36:39.921 --> 00:36:41.482]  Now, we're going to go to our guests in a moment.
[00:36:41.502 --> 00:36:47.084]  For those that don't know, I remember in 98 going to a big, quote, smart growth conference in Austin.
[00:36:47.104 --> 00:36:48.024]  Michael Dell spoke.
[00:36:48.284 --> 00:36:49.985]  The head of Bank of America spoke.
[00:36:50.045 --> 00:36:50.945]  Bank One spoke.
[00:36:51.345 --> 00:36:53.186]  It was elitist from across the planet.
[00:36:53.806 --> 00:36:55.967]  5,000 plus city officials from the U.S.
[00:36:56.027 --> 00:36:57.848]  and county officials, they attended.
[00:36:58.128 --> 00:36:59.528]  Huge banquet halls.
[00:36:59.748 --> 00:37:00.428]  I was there.
[00:37:00.829 --> 00:37:01.649]  We shot video.
[00:37:02.049 --> 00:37:04.490]  I did that old news report out we did and put it on the website.
[00:37:05.191 --> 00:37:07.312]  I've got hundreds of those on prisonplanet.tv.
[00:37:07.352 --> 00:37:07.973]  We should post that.
[00:37:08.533 --> 00:37:09.874]  And I even interviewed Michael Dell and others.
[00:37:09.894 --> 00:37:10.955]  And they got up.
[00:37:11.055 --> 00:37:13.256]  Former Dallas Cowboy players are involved in it.
[00:37:13.777 --> 00:37:17.739]  And they're all developers up there laughing about how they're going to take everybody's property.
[00:37:17.779 --> 00:37:20.801]  They then snatched 15,000 acres from people.
[00:37:21.041 --> 00:37:24.384]  First, they devalued it, saying you couldn't build for five years.
[00:37:24.804 --> 00:37:26.345]  Then they gave them pennies on the dollar.
[00:37:26.385 --> 00:37:27.786]  Then they took all the restrictions off.
[00:37:27.806 --> 00:37:31.128]  They're building luxury five-star hotel golf courses.
[00:37:31.148 --> 00:37:32.189]  It's all built now.
[00:37:33.354 --> 00:37:37.296]  Huge, $10 million houses, lavish country clubs.
[00:37:37.736 --> 00:37:43.740]  I mean, the value of the land is millions of dollars per acre in some cases.
[00:37:44.180 --> 00:37:45.421]  Millions of dollars.
[00:37:45.721 --> 00:37:52.925]  I know farmers and ranchers who are personal friends of mine who had 200, 300 acre plots taken, and guess how much they were paid per acre?
[00:37:52.965 --> 00:37:54.766]  A couple thousand dollars.
[00:37:55.206 --> 00:37:57.167]  Absolute premium.
[00:37:57.647 --> 00:37:58.388]  Premium.
[00:37:58.428 --> 00:38:02.670]  I mean, if you paid $200,000 an acre, you'd be getting a good deal on most of this land.
[00:38:03.516 --> 00:38:04.137]  We're good to go.
[00:38:18.041 --> 00:38:19.502]  Don't let people build on their own land.
[00:38:19.562 --> 00:38:25.727]  Drive down the property value so they can say you're not allowed to basically sell it for full value.
[00:38:26.027 --> 00:38:29.950]  Then they make a sweetheart deal, eminent domain it, force you to sell it for pennies on the dollar.
[00:38:30.170 --> 00:38:31.371]  Pennies on the dollar!
[00:38:31.631 --> 00:38:38.436]  Then turn around, take all restrictions off, and build luxury homes, hotels, giant spas, five-star spas.
[00:38:38.476 --> 00:38:39.717]  I mean, you ought to see it, folks.
[00:38:40.217 --> 00:38:42.039]  The average person can't afford to go out there.
[00:38:43.460 --> 00:38:45.201]  This is where I live, okay?
[00:38:45.879 --> 00:38:47.460]  Okay, this is what I've witnessed.
[00:38:47.860 --> 00:38:53.743]  And now this family is being absolutely raped there in New Jersey, in Piscataway.
[00:38:55.524 --> 00:38:55.844]  Clara...
[00:38:56.841 --> 00:39:00.743]  Helper, I really appreciate you coming on with us today.
[00:39:01.783 --> 00:39:03.243]  Thank you for listening to that rant.
[00:39:03.524 --> 00:39:07.005]  The info I just laid out, we've never talked before, you're just joining us on air.
[00:39:07.705 --> 00:39:12.807]  The rant I just laid out, does that mirror or is that similar or is it different from what you're dealing with?
[00:39:13.387 --> 00:39:16.809]  Oh, Alex, it mirrors everything that we're dealing with.
[00:39:17.749 --> 00:39:25.912]  We have big developers funding the politicians here in town, all the way up to the state.
[00:39:28.999 --> 00:39:37.267]  Now, I want to be clear.
[00:39:37.327 --> 00:39:39.769]  They're saying this is for environmental reasons.
[00:39:40.270 --> 00:39:44.273]  Nationwide, the biggest landowner is the Nature Conservancy and the Sierra Club and others.
[00:39:44.534 --> 00:39:51.340]  They've got all these weird little cult members driving their Volvos, feeling good, feeling loving, pushing for all.
[00:39:51.740 --> 00:39:59.062]  And then openly, nationwide, it's handed over to the biggest developers for golf courses and luxury hotels and townhouses and high-rises.
[00:39:59.542 --> 00:40:02.662]  And you tell the environmentalists this, and they go, you're a liar.
[00:40:02.862 --> 00:40:04.523]  They will not face the public facts.
[00:40:04.683 --> 00:40:07.823]  But even the newspaper in your town admits they're going to develop it.
[00:40:07.863 --> 00:40:08.524]  Sorry, go ahead.
[00:40:08.904 --> 00:40:09.164]  Right.
[00:40:09.224 --> 00:40:10.104]  No, absolutely.
[00:40:10.144 --> 00:40:16.785]  There's an agreement between the town and the county that allows the township to sell, lease, or donate the land.
[00:40:17.385 --> 00:40:19.806]  We call it the backdoor for redevelopment.
[00:40:20.716 --> 00:40:23.937]  That's what they're taking it under the pretense of open space.
[00:40:24.997 --> 00:40:29.218]  The township, at the same time, is building.
[00:40:29.258 --> 00:40:33.079]  They've had their foot on the accelerator pedal for ages now.
[00:40:33.499 --> 00:40:36.140]  They're just building it and building it and turning it into a city.
[00:40:37.100 --> 00:40:45.642]  So there's, and they have, I think, between a quarter and a third of the town is already in park lands, including Rutgers is right here.
[00:40:46.129 --> 00:40:48.370]  The ecological preserve.
[00:40:48.871 --> 00:40:53.553]  And they've taken properties out of the ecological, pieces of land out of the ecological preserve.
[00:40:53.633 --> 00:40:54.273]  Of course they have.
[00:40:54.293 --> 00:40:54.994]  That's the plan.
[00:40:55.814 --> 00:41:01.978]  And of course people don't remember five years later, they grabbed the land five years later, luxury hotels and NAFTA highways.
[00:41:02.998 --> 00:41:10.082]  Tell us, please, about the family history of this land and how this all started and how much it's really worth and what they're trying to give you.
[00:41:10.603 --> 00:41:16.506]  Okay, well, my husband's family has owned this land since about 1921.
[00:41:17.607 --> 00:41:18.427]  It was a dairy farm.
[00:41:18.447 --> 00:41:20.388]  It was a sheep farm, then a dairy farm.
[00:41:21.329 --> 00:41:31.254]  We do vegetable farming, and we have also trees and shrubs and pumpkin picking, some agri-entertainment as well, horseback riding, mulch, organic screen topsoil.
[00:41:33.075 --> 00:41:35.036]  So it's really a private park.
[00:41:35.905 --> 00:41:37.186]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:41:37.206 --> 00:41:38.107]  That's what my husband said.
[00:41:38.127 --> 00:41:40.528]  He said, they're looking for passive recreation.
[00:41:40.588 --> 00:41:42.269]  We have recreation right here.
[00:41:42.609 --> 00:41:47.132]  There's no other horse riding academy in this area of the county.
[00:41:47.292 --> 00:41:48.073]  We're the only one.
[00:41:49.866 --> 00:41:50.567]  It's the same thing.
[00:41:50.587 --> 00:41:55.729]  They got a place called Reimer's Ranch, beautiful land out on the Perton Allis where we used to go camping.
[00:41:56.029 --> 00:41:57.130]  The old man died.
[00:41:57.390 --> 00:42:01.251]  The state and the county and everybody said, oh, we're getting it to make it a nature preserve.
[00:42:01.271 --> 00:42:01.811]  And guess what?
[00:42:02.112 --> 00:42:05.233]  They're going to build luxury homes all over it with our money.
[00:42:05.313 --> 00:42:05.933]  Sorry, go ahead.
[00:42:05.953 --> 00:42:06.994]  Right.
[00:42:07.034 --> 00:42:12.056]  They took 25 acres of the farm in the mid-70s.
[00:42:12.756 --> 00:42:16.518]  And around that time, there was an attorney...
[00:42:17.988 --> 00:42:19.069]  Who lived across the street.
[00:42:19.089 --> 00:42:20.650]  He used to come here for eggs.
[00:42:20.690 --> 00:42:23.893]  He did some work for my father-in-law and uncle.
[00:42:24.733 --> 00:42:32.859]  And there was some dispute, a fee dispute, and the attorney wanted the corner, a corner, part of the parcel.
[00:42:33.280 --> 00:42:34.540]  And he had wanted that piece.
[00:42:35.541 --> 00:42:37.803]  So it ended up with a dispute.
[00:42:38.683 --> 00:42:39.744]  Coincidentally...
[00:42:41.062 --> 00:42:44.544]  This is really, I'm sure, more than coincidence.
[00:42:44.644 --> 00:42:45.684]  Well, this is what tyranny is.
[00:42:45.744 --> 00:42:46.345]  Let me stop you.
[00:42:46.385 --> 00:42:51.007]  This is where private individuals and governments use government to set up all their own little private empires.
[00:42:51.027 --> 00:42:51.367]  Go ahead.
[00:42:51.647 --> 00:42:52.268]  Right.
[00:42:52.288 --> 00:43:03.593]  Well, this attorney was partnered, and we didn't find this out until this past year, that they were actually partners.
[00:43:03.613 --> 00:43:10.497]  The judge who presided over our case was a partner of this attorney.
[00:43:11.259 --> 00:43:13.581]  Who had represented my father.
[00:43:13.601 --> 00:43:15.782]  You need to file a judicial complaint on him.
[00:43:16.503 --> 00:43:17.163]  Right.
[00:43:17.243 --> 00:43:17.943]  Well, he did.
[00:43:17.963 --> 00:43:27.930]  The judge, we finally, you know, it's really hard to find attorneys who are going to fight for you because they're going up against, you know, the good old boys network.
[00:43:28.450 --> 00:43:32.733]  They're going up against that, you know, that real, that wall.
[00:43:33.874 --> 00:43:37.536]  And we found someone, Barbara Schwartz, who,
[00:43:38.769 --> 00:43:42.870]  Who brought in conflicts of interest because there's so many conflicts of interest.
[00:43:43.270 --> 00:43:44.090]  It's unbelievable.
[00:43:44.110 --> 00:43:45.451]  It's not called conflict of interest.
[00:43:45.551 --> 00:43:47.251]  It's called collusion and racketeering.
[00:43:47.451 --> 00:43:48.251]  There you go.
[00:43:49.031 --> 00:43:54.012]  And the judge did... He's the head judge in the county.
[00:43:54.453 --> 00:43:57.233]  He assigns the cases, but he kept this one for himself.
[00:43:58.473 --> 00:44:05.895]  He said that since we brought up the conflict, since my husband and Barbara brought them up, he felt vilified and...
[00:44:06.483 --> 00:44:08.245]  Which is another conflict of interest.
[00:44:26.994 --> 00:44:27.234]  Right.
[00:44:27.495 --> 00:44:37.362]  He should have just... It should have just... You know, just to bring in another tangent, I don't mean to confuse people, because there was also... You may have heard the code word Machiavelli.
[00:44:38.683 --> 00:44:55.397]  Our governor, McGreevey, stepped down because of... My brother-in-law had donated money to, I believe it was the Victory Fund, and McGreevey's fundraiser...
[00:44:57.107 --> 00:45:05.173]  Was going to help us get a better price for selling our development rights so we could remain on the land.
[00:45:06.394 --> 00:45:08.756]  And we were going to go into farmland preservation.
[00:45:10.117 --> 00:45:14.340]  Well, the fundraiser is in jail.
[00:45:15.201 --> 00:45:17.082]  McGreevy stepped down.
[00:45:18.443 --> 00:45:19.764]  And we're being thrown out.
[00:45:20.545 --> 00:45:21.746]  It's like our punishment.
[00:45:22.364 --> 00:45:26.706]  Yeah, this is the local mafia letting everybody know who the boss is.
[00:45:27.366 --> 00:45:28.087]  This is incredible.
[00:45:28.347 --> 00:45:29.367]  So run through it.
[00:45:29.407 --> 00:45:30.628]  What are you facing right now?
[00:45:31.048 --> 00:45:32.089]  Tell us about the cases.
[00:45:32.109 --> 00:45:37.291]  Tell us how much the land is really valued and where this fight goes, how much they're offering.
[00:45:37.771 --> 00:45:43.074]  Okay, well, I believe a building lot goes for about a quarter of a million.
[00:45:43.094 --> 00:45:45.835]  There's four to an acre.
[00:45:45.855 --> 00:45:47.736]  That would be about a million an acre.
[00:45:47.756 --> 00:45:48.396]  There's 75 acres.
[00:45:50.810 --> 00:45:52.351]  You can do the math on that one.
[00:45:53.351 --> 00:45:58.876]  And then the jury... And, of course, that's not even... You, by law, are supposed to get best price.
[00:45:59.276 --> 00:46:01.197]  You're just talking about just compensation.
[00:46:01.237 --> 00:46:08.122]  You should be able to sell it for three times the current value because the real estate increases in value.
[00:46:08.443 --> 00:46:14.707]  But the jury was given a theoretical hypothetical scenario of 133 units for the property...
[00:46:17.969 --> 00:46:20.290]  They awarded us $18 million.
[00:46:20.751 --> 00:46:37.499]  Now, the appraiser, the appraiser who, unfortunately, was open when it was a little too late, he had said to me, he said, oh, well, when you're selling land on such a sizable tract as yours, there's a discount.
[00:46:38.299 --> 00:46:40.940]  And he said, well, let me just explain it like this.
[00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:46.123]  He said, when you sell one shirt, you said there's a higher price.
[00:46:46.656 --> 00:46:50.298]  Then when you sell 300 shirts, there's a discount.
[00:46:50.879 --> 00:46:58.923]  And I said to him, John, you know, I said, the only difference is, and it's a huge difference, you can always buy more shirts.
[00:46:58.963 --> 00:47:00.825]  Well, that's not how appraising works.
[00:47:00.965 --> 00:47:01.785]  You own the land.
[00:47:01.845 --> 00:47:04.667]  You sell it for what the market will bear.
[00:47:04.787 --> 00:47:05.547]  Bear, right.
[00:47:05.668 --> 00:47:09.830]  Yeah, the appraiser's telling you, well, we're going to devalue your land because I say so.
[00:47:10.871 --> 00:47:11.131]  Right.
[00:47:11.231 --> 00:47:13.332]  It's a made to, right.
[00:47:13.612 --> 00:47:14.553]  And the courts,
[00:47:15.275 --> 00:47:19.952]  The whole group there sets the standard by, oh, it's 133 units.
[00:47:21.807 --> 00:47:22.607]  Well, you know what?
[00:47:22.927 --> 00:47:27.309]  The township here, they changed the zoning at a whim.
[00:47:27.669 --> 00:47:31.910]  So the land is really worth over $70 million, and that's a current rate.
[00:47:32.331 --> 00:47:37.792]  You could keep the land and sell pieces over the next 20 years and end up making probably $300 million.
[00:47:37.832 --> 00:47:42.854]  Well, with the inflation of land prices, this is in a highly developed area, very sought after.
[00:47:43.934 --> 00:47:45.195]  So what's going to happen on Monday?
[00:47:46.085 --> 00:47:49.587]  Well, on Monday they have provided no relocation assistance.
[00:47:49.687 --> 00:47:51.667]  Monday they're evicting us at 3 p.m.
[00:47:51.687 --> 00:47:56.549]  We've gotten letters from the attorneys that the township wants to bring in self-help.
[00:47:56.669 --> 00:48:07.734]  Typically the sheriff's department evicts you, but our township wants to bring in armed personnel to take us out, to remove us, if we don't get out ahead of the deadline.
[00:48:07.774 --> 00:48:10.455]  And then force you to take the $18 million.
[00:48:10.995 --> 00:48:11.335]  Right.
[00:48:11.515 --> 00:48:12.696]  No, no, wait.
[00:48:13.096 --> 00:48:13.796]  I'm sorry, Alex.
[00:48:13.836 --> 00:48:15.537]  The $18 million, the township
[00:48:16.971 --> 00:48:20.135]  They are appealing it in the state Supreme Court.
[00:48:20.195 --> 00:48:21.256]  Oh yeah, you'll never get it, sure.
[00:48:21.456 --> 00:48:23.618]  Right, they froze the money.
[00:48:23.859 --> 00:48:26.001]  I don't believe they put all of it in an account.
[00:48:26.421 --> 00:48:30.085]  They're going to take your land, spend millions of taxpayer money to never pay it.
[00:48:30.106 --> 00:48:30.566]  You'll get nothing.
[00:48:30.606 --> 00:48:35.912]  Right, and then on top of it, they are alleging that they're environmental contaminants.
[00:48:36.232 --> 00:48:37.253]  You've got to be kidding me.
[00:48:37.833 --> 00:48:39.754]  I mean, why would we kill ourselves?
[00:48:39.875 --> 00:48:44.738]  And now, exactly, then they'll end up charging you money for the environmental toxicity.
[00:48:45.078 --> 00:48:48.100]  Well, they say it could potentially be $5 million.
[00:48:48.120 --> 00:48:50.642]  Well, they made a deposit of $4.3 million based on 1999.
[00:48:50.702 --> 00:48:51.742]  They're made for appraisal.
[00:48:56.466 --> 00:48:59.048]  And we're going to end up owing them money.
[00:48:59.288 --> 00:49:04.231]  And then they'll send in a few bulldozers, scrape some topsoil off from the farming that's gone on.
[00:49:04.831 --> 00:49:05.912]  See, it's always the same.
[00:49:06.352 --> 00:49:08.773]  I don't even know the story, and I can sit here and tell you the story.
[00:49:09.034 --> 00:49:09.754]  No, absolutely.
[00:49:09.794 --> 00:49:13.156]  As a matter of fact, we have organic topsoil.
[00:49:13.176 --> 00:49:14.717]  We've screened organic crop soil.
[00:49:15.117 --> 00:49:17.899]  They have been harassing my husband, giving him tickets.
[00:49:18.630 --> 00:49:24.816]  Again, from the top down, the police, all of them, this is a criminal government.
[00:49:25.356 --> 00:49:26.137]  Oh, it's terrible.
[00:49:26.197 --> 00:49:27.318]  It's horrendous.
[00:49:27.398 --> 00:49:28.319]  It's madness.
[00:49:28.719 --> 00:49:38.107]  You know, people used to say, or my husband used to say, you know, they're fascists, and other people came in calling them Nazis, and I used to say, oh, you know, you have to be mannerly.
[00:49:38.127 --> 00:49:38.628]  You know what?
[00:49:38.948 --> 00:49:39.829]  If the shoe fits,
[00:49:40.700 --> 00:49:42.161]  That's exactly what they are.
[00:49:42.181 --> 00:49:43.121]  They are dictators.
[00:49:43.141 --> 00:49:44.182]  It's simple.
[00:49:44.262 --> 00:49:46.483]  Look, they've set the precedent nationwide.
[00:49:46.523 --> 00:49:49.344]  They're grabbing everyone's property and not even paying you for it.
[00:49:49.404 --> 00:50:01.630]  Listen, the people who were lucky got $2,000, $3,000 an acre for premium land that is now going for a million dollars an acre in some cases, on average over $300,000 an acre, right here in Austin.
[00:50:01.670 --> 00:50:02.470]  Believe me, I've seen it.
[00:50:02.810 --> 00:50:03.911]  There'll be a hotel on your land.
[00:50:03.931 --> 00:50:04.611]  You'll never see a dime.
[00:50:07.052 --> 00:50:07.292]  Right.
[00:50:07.312 --> 00:50:11.054]  The same thing, I think, is in Paulsboro in Gloucester County here.
[00:50:11.795 --> 00:50:17.458]  Farmers are getting hundreds or thousands for their land, and they're going to build casinos and hotels.
[00:50:18.018 --> 00:50:19.879]  So it's prime real estate.
[00:50:19.919 --> 00:50:21.320]  It's a waterfront property.
[00:50:21.780 --> 00:50:25.642]  And then you have people even in the city of Camden, they're being displaced.
[00:50:26.865 --> 00:50:33.911]  You have people in Long Branch here, Waterfront Property, and some of them are the New Jersey Shore.
[00:50:34.032 --> 00:50:36.234]  You know, I've got a trick for you to beat them.
[00:50:36.254 --> 00:50:37.094]  It may be too late.
[00:50:37.134 --> 00:50:43.961]  You go to bigger government mafias, bigger corporation mafias, offer a deal with them, they'll come in and push out the others.
[00:50:44.261 --> 00:50:45.703]  It's probably the only chance you've got now.
[00:50:46.063 --> 00:50:46.603]  Stay there.
[00:50:46.744 --> 00:50:48.385]  We'll be right back with our guest.
[00:50:48.465 --> 00:50:49.146]  One more segment.
[00:50:49.586 --> 00:50:50.607]  With Clara Halpern.
[00:50:51.007 --> 00:50:51.927]  This is your government.
[00:50:51.967 --> 00:50:53.148]  This is the New World Order.
[00:50:53.248 --> 00:50:54.388]  This is how they operate.
[00:50:54.628 --> 00:50:55.609]  This is what they do.
[00:50:55.689 --> 00:50:56.669]  It's only going to get worse.
[00:50:56.689 --> 00:50:58.110]  This is what the tyranny is all about.
[00:51:01.512 --> 00:51:05.854]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:51:06.034 --> 00:51:10.396]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:51:12.386 --> 00:51:15.008]  To use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:51:15.028 --> 00:51:17.851]  The New World Order can emerge.
[00:51:18.171 --> 00:51:22.375]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:51:22.455 --> 00:51:29.382]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:51:29.522 --> 00:51:31.524]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:51:31.904 --> 00:51:42.211]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:51:42.511 --> 00:51:47.875]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.
[00:51:48.375 --> 00:51:51.037]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.
[00:51:51.137 --> 00:51:51.897]  Or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[00:51:51.917 --> 00:51:52.458]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:51:52.518 --> 00:51:54.039]  Order today and spread the word.
[00:52:01.292 --> 00:52:01.933]  We're good to go.
[00:52:22.210 --> 00:52:23.171]  We're good to go.
[00:52:52.470 --> 00:53:08.296]  Herbal Healer Academy is the global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.
[00:53:08.516 --> 00:53:10.777]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.
[00:53:10.977 --> 00:53:17.320]  We provide outstanding products like Esiac, Colloidal Silver 500 parts per million, Olive Leaf Extract,
[00:53:17.660 --> 00:53:18.301]  We're good to go.
[00:53:47.179 --> 00:53:50.261]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[00:53:50.441 --> 00:53:56.384]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective, natural alternatives and education.
[00:54:06.529 --> 00:54:11.271]  Imagine, they're trying to charge them money to take their land.
[00:54:11.311 --> 00:54:12.892]  Same thing in New London, Connecticut.
[00:54:13.493 --> 00:54:32.506]  If you hear about this case in New Jersey on the national news, which you probably won't even hear that, it'll just be, oh, they're taking some land, it's an eminent domain, without paying them, and then threatening to charge them money for land currently worth, conservatively, 70-plus million dollars.
[00:54:34.507 --> 00:54:41.532]  They're going to charge them to take their family land that's worth over 70 million dollars right now.
[00:54:43.442 --> 00:54:47.265]  In closing, Clara Halper, how do we help you?
[00:54:47.826 --> 00:54:48.706]  What are your remedies?
[00:54:48.786 --> 00:54:50.408]  Is there any type of state injunction?
[00:54:51.128 --> 00:54:54.191]  As you said, they're already trying to put people in jail who've tried to defend you.
[00:54:55.132 --> 00:54:56.072]  Where does all this go?
[00:54:57.293 --> 00:55:03.979]  You know, right now, there's a public advocate's office in New Jersey.
[00:55:04.019 --> 00:55:05.680]  We've sought after his help.
[00:55:06.781 --> 00:55:12.906]  We asked for a moratorium on eminent domain, but he was unable to provide that.
[00:55:13.827 --> 00:55:16.209]  The governor doesn't want to deal with it directly.
[00:55:16.229 --> 00:55:20.633]  I'm afraid that I don't know what the remedies are.
[00:55:20.653 --> 00:55:21.513]  I really don't.
[00:55:22.955 --> 00:55:37.766]  We've almost exhausted all our remedies in court, and the state Supreme Court has at least three justices I know that are very close with a law firm that was engaged in dual representation with us.
[00:55:41.627 --> 00:55:42.308]  And the county.
[00:55:42.448 --> 00:55:49.494]  When you go to these events, when you go to the city council, do you ever stand up there and say, how do you sleep at night engaging in this criminal activity?
[00:55:50.095 --> 00:55:51.016]  Oh my gosh, yes.
[00:55:51.156 --> 00:55:52.998]  Myself, other people have as well.
[00:55:53.078 --> 00:55:54.119]  Do they just smile at you?
[00:55:54.179 --> 00:55:54.940]  Are they enjoying it?
[00:55:55.480 --> 00:56:04.328]  Yeah, they just sometimes, yeah, as a matter of fact, and then they try to belittle my husband and make him out like he's...
[00:56:06.182 --> 00:56:08.303]  You know, a nuisance.
[00:56:08.323 --> 00:56:12.045]  The township attorney, I delivered a package to his office.
[00:56:13.725 --> 00:56:16.506]  I'd left the office, and I'd gone.
[00:56:16.606 --> 00:56:20.028]  I was just going down the staircase, and he came out.
[00:56:20.388 --> 00:56:22.769]  He threw the package at me, hitting my leg.
[00:56:23.169 --> 00:56:25.930]  I mean, they're just so... There's madness.
[00:56:27.491 --> 00:56:28.451]  It's only going to get worse.
[00:56:28.491 --> 00:56:30.332]  Everybody's going to get a taste of it real soon.
[00:56:30.372 --> 00:56:32.313]  It's spreading everywhere.
[00:56:32.333 --> 00:56:34.794]  You know, it's unfortunate because I know people...
[00:56:35.405 --> 00:56:38.206]  A lot of times feel that it's not going to happen to them.
[00:56:38.546 --> 00:56:39.206]  But I see it.
[00:56:39.266 --> 00:56:40.146]  I see it everywhere.
[00:56:40.246 --> 00:56:44.548]  Especially in New Jersey, there is land.
[00:56:44.588 --> 00:56:45.988]  They've cut up the state.
[00:56:46.148 --> 00:56:49.689]  There's just no rationale to it.
[00:56:49.709 --> 00:56:52.970]  The only rationale is that it's a developer's haven.
[00:56:52.990 --> 00:56:54.410]  What's going to happen Monday?
[00:56:55.491 --> 00:56:57.531]  Monday, they're evicting us at 3 o'clock.
[00:56:58.311 --> 00:57:03.733]  We're trying to get whatever we can out of here because whatever we leave,
[00:57:04.546 --> 00:57:08.993]  It's considered abandoned property, and they're going to confiscate it as such.
[00:57:09.393 --> 00:57:15.622]  So our crops that they were supposed to pay for, our trees, our shrubs, our product, we're totally out of business.
[00:57:16.235 --> 00:57:18.456]  And we're homeless.
[00:57:18.476 --> 00:57:20.637]  They're waging war against you so you can't fight them.
[00:57:21.157 --> 00:57:23.958]  Let them know that you're going to hire PIs.
[00:57:24.699 --> 00:57:27.880]  And you may not get them on this, but see, these people are all criminals.
[00:57:28.340 --> 00:57:30.321]  So you will get them on other things.
[00:57:30.401 --> 00:57:31.381]  Crooks do other things.
[00:57:31.802 --> 00:57:32.282]  Be there.
[00:57:32.502 --> 00:57:33.802]  Catch them cheating on the wife.
[00:57:33.882 --> 00:57:35.023]  Catch them when they're stealing.
[00:57:35.383 --> 00:57:36.283]  Catch them on other things.
[00:57:36.384 --> 00:57:40.445]  Let them know that you're going to be there and you're going to bring them down.
[00:57:41.446 --> 00:57:42.226]  How can we help you?
[00:57:43.945 --> 00:57:49.509]  Alex, as many people that can come out to this rally, that would be helpful.
[00:57:51.891 --> 00:58:02.077]  Calling and sending correspondence to the politicians in town and the state saying to stop eminent domain.
[00:58:02.137 --> 00:58:03.098]  And that's Piscataway.
[00:58:03.118 --> 00:58:04.198]  Well, this isn't even eminent domain.
[00:58:04.238 --> 00:58:05.479]  This is them stealing land.
[00:58:05.559 --> 00:58:06.160]  Right, right.
[00:58:06.180 --> 00:58:07.160]  You're absolutely right.
[00:58:07.861 --> 00:58:08.521]  It is stealing.
[00:58:08.581 --> 00:58:09.942]  It's land grabbing.
[00:58:10.002 --> 00:58:12.524]  Well, Clara Halpert, we're also all going to pray for you.
[00:58:13.286 --> 00:58:16.307]  Because you're on the front lines and you're being literally devoured.
[00:58:16.327 --> 00:58:20.089]  I know you're going to be very busy Monday, but I'm on the air in the hours before this happens.
[00:58:20.369 --> 00:58:25.872]  Can we check in with you on Monday and then maybe you can have the city council phone number and maybe the governor's phone number on Monday.
[00:58:25.892 --> 00:58:26.792]  We'll get that out on air.
[00:58:27.313 --> 00:58:27.793]  Oh, sure.
[00:58:27.833 --> 00:58:28.533]  That would be great.
[00:58:28.593 --> 00:58:29.253]  Thanks, Alex.
[00:58:29.313 --> 00:58:29.534]  Great.
[00:58:29.554 --> 00:58:33.415]  Let me get you on at like 12 noon on Monday so we can stand up for you.
[00:58:33.435 --> 00:58:35.816]  God bless you, Mrs. Halpern.
[00:58:35.856 --> 00:58:36.257]  Thank you.
[00:58:36.297 --> 00:58:37.297]  Thank you for having me.
[00:58:37.337 --> 00:58:37.637]  You bet.
[00:58:37.677 --> 00:58:38.137]  We stand with you.
[00:58:41.368 --> 00:58:46.212]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-300-7645.
[00:58:46.272 --> 00:58:46.713]  Big Brother.
[00:58:46.873 --> 00:58:47.653]  Mainstream media.
[00:58:47.874 --> 00:58:53.098]  Government cover-ups.
[00:58:53.518 --> 00:58:54.579]  You want answers?
[00:58:54.799 --> 00:58:56.541]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.612 --> 00:59:09.274]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.794 --> 00:59:13.917]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:23.642 --> 00:59:25.323]  We have Clara Halper on.
[00:59:25.683 --> 00:59:27.784]  Her station has just joined us in the last hour.
[00:59:28.485 --> 00:59:30.346]  She's in Piscataway, New Jersey.
[00:59:31.098 --> 00:59:38.281]  Her land is publicly valued just on the tax rolls at over 70 plus million dollars.
[00:59:38.961 --> 00:59:52.667]  They are actually trying to go into the organic farm, which is the middle of the city, and take it and charge them for environmental contamination so they will actually be in debt instead of getting any money.
[00:59:53.507 --> 01:00:01.373]  So we're not going to give you anything to steal your land that you've had since the 1920s, but we're also going to then charge you money for it, just like New London.
[01:00:01.814 --> 01:00:15.785]  This is the big secret that the neocon talk show host won't tell you when they talk about all this land grabbing, and it's being run by the big developers and the stupid, phony environmentalists who aren't real environmentalists are out there helping to promote all of this.
[01:00:15.805 --> 01:00:18.187]  All right, shifting gears.
[01:00:19.608 --> 01:00:20.649]  Art imitates life.
[01:00:20.749 --> 01:00:21.990]  Life imitates art.
[01:00:23.750 --> 01:00:36.482]  And my good friend who is well aware of the New World Order, well aware of what's happening politically, even back from his days at UT and college as a philosophy major producing one of the best TV shows I've ever seen on corruption in government.
[01:00:37.162 --> 01:00:39.684]  So he's been aware of the New World Order really longer than I have been.
[01:00:39.724 --> 01:00:44.409]  He's Tommy Pallotta, and he's produced a lot of other big Hollywood films and some other art films.
[01:00:44.429 --> 01:00:45.710]  He produced Waking Life that I'm in.
[01:00:46.802 --> 01:00:56.205]  Releasing in major cities around the country today and then hundreds and hundreds and then thousands of more screens in the next month is the film A Scanner Darkly.
[01:00:56.705 --> 01:00:58.966]  And Tommy Pallotta joins us now.
[01:00:58.986 --> 01:01:03.468]  We're going to break here in a few minutes and come back and get into more detail on the film.
[01:01:03.988 --> 01:01:06.629]  The film is so important because it exposes the police state.
[01:01:06.649 --> 01:01:13.531]  It exposes governments and corporations creating false crises that they manipulate and control.
[01:01:14.731 --> 01:01:16.052]  It also is very dark.
[01:01:16.112 --> 01:01:17.132]  It's also very humorous.
[01:01:17.533 --> 01:01:19.254]  It has Winona Ryder in it.
[01:01:19.274 --> 01:01:24.496]  It has Woody Harrelson, Keanu Reeves, of course, Robert Downey Jr.
[01:01:25.017 --> 01:01:26.878]  And joining us is Tommy Pallotta.
[01:01:26.918 --> 01:01:28.058]  Tommy, good to have you on with us.
[01:01:28.219 --> 01:01:28.679]  Hey, Alex.
[01:01:29.699 --> 01:01:30.620]  I know you're very busy.
[01:01:30.640 --> 01:01:31.460]  I appreciate the time.
[01:01:31.820 --> 01:01:33.521]  Oh, no, it's a fun day.
[01:01:33.541 --> 01:01:34.382]  It's an exciting day.
[01:01:35.208 --> 01:01:35.688]  That's right.
[01:01:35.768 --> 01:01:39.950]  It opened in theaters around the country yesterday in select theaters.
[01:01:39.990 --> 01:01:44.493]  I'm told it's been sold out at the midnight showing and already sold out right now around Austin.
[01:01:45.353 --> 01:01:45.853]  Well, I hope so.
[01:01:45.913 --> 01:01:49.535]  I mean, it's only opening up in about seven cities this week.
[01:01:49.575 --> 01:01:52.497]  It expands next week, and it's going to be kind of a slow rollout.
[01:01:52.577 --> 01:01:54.638]  So it'll take a couple weeks to get everywhere.
[01:01:54.718 --> 01:02:00.941]  But if you go to ScannerDarklyMovie.com, it'll tell you when it's going to open up in a city near you.
[01:02:03.414 --> 01:02:07.337]  If you had to describe the film just in 60 seconds, how would you describe A Scanner Darkly?
[01:02:08.038 --> 01:02:10.459]  Oh, Alex, you could probably do that better than me.
[01:02:12.681 --> 01:02:14.402]  But I want Tommy Pallotta's description.
[01:02:15.223 --> 01:02:18.585]  Well, you know, it's based on a novel by Philip K. Dick that was written in the 70s.
[01:02:18.665 --> 01:02:23.729]  And it was really a lot about sort of the Nixon paranoia at that time.
[01:02:24.330 --> 01:02:25.751]  And it was a lot about the drug war.
[01:02:26.031 --> 01:02:28.292]  And kind of what we did was update it a little bit.
[01:02:29.273 --> 01:02:30.954]  And, you know, it sort of came really post-9-11.
[01:02:32.291 --> 01:02:50.506]  And, you know, we kind of started thinking about it, the director Richard Linklater and I, and, you know, with the sort of Patriot Act and everything else that was going on and the war on terror, it started to feel a lot like the war on drugs before, you know, just sort of like this enemy that you couldn't really see and how, you know, fear was a way to sort of manipulate people and things like that.
[01:02:50.546 --> 01:02:52.087]  So we just kind of updated it a little bit.
[01:02:52.488 --> 01:02:59.974]  The sort of the war on drugs is still part of it, but we sort of expanded a little bit more on the war on terror and sort of how you use fear to manipulate people.
[01:03:00.956 --> 01:03:02.557]  We'll talk about that when we get back from break.
[01:03:02.577 --> 01:03:06.118]  You've been at big press junkets and the media says, well, how did you know about surveillance?
[01:03:06.159 --> 01:03:08.079]  How did you know it would be so big right now?
[01:03:08.119 --> 01:03:08.800]  What was your answer?
[01:03:09.860 --> 01:03:12.602]  You know, I mean, it's always been a big problem.
[01:03:12.762 --> 01:03:20.926]  You know, I mean, I think that he wrote about it in the 70s and it was a problem then and it was a problem before, you know, even now that it's in the headlines.
[01:03:20.986 --> 01:03:30.110]  I think that things sort of just fall in and out of fashion kind of and right now some people were pretty overt with what they were doing and, you know, the headlines grabbed it, but it's always been a problem.
[01:03:32.091 --> 01:03:33.612]  Give us the website for the film.
[01:03:34.313 --> 01:03:40.077]  It's ScannerDarklyMovie.com We've got links on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[01:03:40.597 --> 01:03:44.339]  And we've created pages that are focusing on the massive coverage it's getting.
[01:03:44.720 --> 01:03:47.642]  We'll talk about the film and what effect it will have on society.
[01:03:48.002 --> 01:03:50.844]  On the other side with the producer of A Scanner Darkly.
[01:03:54.494 --> 01:03:57.336]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[01:03:57.577 --> 01:03:58.297]  Hello, my friends.
[01:03:58.377 --> 01:03:59.178]  Alex Jones here.
[01:03:59.518 --> 01:04:04.182]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[01:04:04.522 --> 01:04:11.268]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[01:04:11.588 --> 01:04:13.570]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[01:04:13.770 --> 01:04:16.592]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[01:04:16.713 --> 01:04:21.377]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[01:04:21.577 --> 01:04:25.981]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[01:04:26.221 --> 01:04:33.447]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[01:04:33.707 --> 01:04:36.129]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.
[01:04:36.289 --> 01:04:38.031]  Call toll-free to get a copy of Martial Law.

[01:04:53.436 --> 01:04:58.717]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones introducing you to the incredible Berkey Solar Charger.
[01:04:58.917 --> 01:05:00.998]  Your source for free solar electricity.
[01:05:01.238 --> 01:05:08.359]  This portable system is the size of a book when folded and small enough to fit into a briefcase, handbag, or glove compartment.
[01:05:08.479 --> 01:05:20.002]  The Berkey Solar Charger has been designed to power the Berkey lights, LED lamps, as well as other applications such as mobile phones, radios, digital cameras, and PDAs when electricity is unavailable.
[01:05:20.402 --> 01:05:27.785]  It's multi-voltage capabilities, multiple adapters, and rechargeable batteries provide for flexible source of auxiliary backup power.
[01:05:28.045 --> 01:05:33.026]  Simply place the Berkey Solar Charger in the sun, plug in your application, and you have power.
[01:05:33.186 --> 01:05:38.188]  Disconnect your application, the system automatically begins charging its own rechargeable batteries.
[01:05:38.468 --> 01:05:43.190]  Get the incredible Berkey Solar Charger for only $75 by calling New Millennium.
[01:05:45.171 --> 01:05:57.541]  People who use Cardivite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[01:05:57.761 --> 01:06:01.164]  For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself time-tested.
[01:06:01.324 --> 01:06:04.767]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite.
[01:06:05.074 --> 01:06:08.296]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[01:06:08.336 --> 01:06:13.819]  This basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the diseases that we've seen.
[01:06:13.839 --> 01:06:23.465]  When we do our program, you know, herbal formulas like Cardavite, and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill now going for a regular job a few months later, we know we're doing something right.
[01:06:23.585 --> 01:06:24.966]  It's a well-thought-out formula.
[01:06:24.986 --> 01:06:30.389]  I mean, the idea of it working on yeast and metals both at the same time and liver function is dead on.
[01:06:30.889 --> 01:06:35.312]  You'll find, I think, that it'll work more than just on heart problems and circulation problems.
[01:06:35.332 --> 01:06:36.753]  It'll work on other problems as well.
[01:06:36.933 --> 01:06:41.435]  For more information, call 1-877-928-8822 or visit our website at www.heartdrop.com.
[01:06:41.455 --> 01:06:42.976]  That toll-free number again?
[01:06:42.996 --> 01:06:43.116]  1-877-928-8822.
[01:06:43.156 --> 01:06:45.598]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:06:45.698 --> 01:06:48.139]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:02.452 --> 01:07:07.934]  We have one of the leaders of one of the largest family groups, victim groups of 9-11, who lost his son joining us.
[01:07:07.954 --> 01:07:10.014]  They've now got major questions about 9-11.
[01:07:10.314 --> 01:07:14.916]  In about 25 minutes, Congressman Ron Paul is scheduled to pop in during the third hour.
[01:07:15.356 --> 01:07:22.078]  Right now, we are joined by my good personal friend, an Austinite off and on, known Tommy now for about seven years.
[01:07:22.935 --> 01:07:23.275]  We're good to go.
[01:07:47.396 --> 01:07:52.601]  It took a year and a half to animate it to the footage that they shot live action.
[01:07:52.701 --> 01:07:56.865]  It has four of some of the biggest Hollywood stars in it.
[01:07:57.505 --> 01:07:59.547]  But the film was made completely independently.
[01:07:59.567 --> 01:08:01.989]  They made a lot of sacrifices to do that.
[01:08:02.350 --> 01:08:07.674]  And it exposes the police state, the phony war on drugs, the surveillance state, and so much more.
[01:08:08.395 --> 01:08:11.118]  Critics are now saying, and the Dick family is now saying...
[01:08:11.578 --> 01:08:12.339]  Hey, thank you.
[01:08:33.263 --> 01:08:37.527]  Tommy, tell us a little bit about the development of the film, how it all came together.
[01:08:38.688 --> 01:08:44.372]  Tell us about the zygote, the birth of Scanner Darkly coming to the big screen.
[01:08:45.093 --> 01:08:51.338]  Well, you know, it really started when we were filming Waking Life, which was a movie that came out in 2001.
[01:08:51.398 --> 01:08:52.419]  We actually shot it around 2000.
[01:08:54.466 --> 01:09:03.491]  And during that time, Richard Linklater and myself were talking a lot about Philip K. Dick, and there's actually a scene in that movie where he is specifically talking about Philip K. Dick.
[01:09:04.532 --> 01:09:20.781]  And we were just sort of thinking about, you know, different stories and talking about, you know, he's the most successfully translated author to film, you know, the most movies, but we kind of felt like that no one had really captured the whole spirit of what he had to say.
[01:09:21.603 --> 01:09:25.944]  And we sort of started throwing a couple ideas around and sort of settled on A Scan of Darkly.
[01:09:25.964 --> 01:09:28.505]  It took us about, you know, four years to really get it going.
[01:09:28.525 --> 01:09:29.565]  It was sort of a hard sell.
[01:09:33.046 --> 01:09:37.928]  You then put the team together, go through the live-action shooting in Austin in 2004.
[01:09:38.228 --> 01:09:39.028]  Describe that for us.
[01:09:39.168 --> 01:09:42.749]  Well, you know, like Waking Life, you basically are making two movies.
[01:09:42.769 --> 01:09:44.790]  You shoot it live-action, and then you...
[01:09:45.896 --> 01:09:49.239]  Tell us about the actors that are in the film, not just the four big stars, but some of the others.
[01:10:09.767 --> 01:10:10.628]  Well, you know, you're in it.
[01:10:11.148 --> 01:10:26.994]  And I think, you know, at the time I was living in New York City before Scanner Darkly, and I think when I moved back to Austin, you were the first person I called because I really felt that you sort of embraced the whole spirit of the film, you know, of the novel, and really what we were trying to say.
[01:10:27.014 --> 01:10:29.916]  So, you know, you have a great cameo in it.
[01:10:30.316 --> 01:10:35.818]  And, of course, you know, we have Keanu Reeves, Winona Ryder, Robert Downey Jr., Rory Cochran, and Woody Harrelson.
[01:10:37.469 --> 01:10:38.269]  It's amazing.
[01:10:38.749 --> 01:10:44.471]  You know, critics almost unanimously, if I haven't seen any negative reviews, they don't know how to peg it or put it in a box.
[01:10:44.531 --> 01:10:46.492]  It's got so many layers or facets.
[01:10:46.532 --> 01:10:50.773]  I mean, it's funny, it's scary, it's depressing, it's hallucinogenic.
[01:10:50.853 --> 01:10:53.274]  I mean, it hits so many different layers.
[01:10:53.314 --> 01:10:54.554]  Can you give us your views on that?
[01:10:55.654 --> 01:10:59.575]  You know, it's kind of an odd film, and maybe I'm too close to it right now.
[01:10:59.595 --> 01:11:01.376]  I kind of really feel that it's a
[01:11:02.071 --> 01:11:05.193]  A movie that I'm personally trying not to delve too far into it.
[01:11:05.233 --> 01:11:07.234]  I mean, I think a lot of it is an instinct.
[01:11:07.894 --> 01:11:10.916]  And I've been thinking a lot about just sort of creativity in general.
[01:11:11.416 --> 01:11:13.898]  People don't really give instinct that much credit anymore.
[01:11:13.938 --> 01:11:18.540]  You know, it's like we always have to verbalize exactly what we're doing and quantify these things.
[01:11:19.261 --> 01:11:23.643]  And, you know, as I get older and the more stuff that I make, the more I'm just sort of following my instincts.
[01:11:23.863 --> 01:11:28.986]  And, you know, it was just a story that I felt should be told, seemed important to me.
[01:11:30.069 --> 01:11:33.716]  And, you know, I really kind of leave it up to the audiences to sort of figure out what it is.
[01:11:33.736 --> 01:11:36.020]  I mean, I know there's a lot of confusion in it.
[01:11:36.040 --> 01:11:39.165]  There's a lot of, you know, duplicity in it.
[01:11:39.205 --> 01:11:41.910]  And I really feel like it's a good reflection of the times right now.
[01:11:42.828 --> 01:11:52.850]  It is a multifaceted, multivariate kaleidoscope is really the term that comes to mind, not just in the visual, but in the different relationships in the film.
[01:11:52.890 --> 01:11:54.850]  I don't want to give too much of it away.
[01:11:54.890 --> 01:11:57.951]  It is showing in Austin and a bunch of other big cities right now.
[01:11:58.071 --> 01:12:04.172]  I have a press release here, I believe it's at AP, opening in 17 cities, but I'm sure you, the producer, know better than that.
[01:12:04.552 --> 01:12:11.293]  And I want to talk more about some of the cities it will then be coming to as they roll it out, as most films are rolled out slowly.
[01:12:12.162 --> 01:12:13.843]  We're good to go.
[01:12:14.083 --> 01:12:14.344]  I think?
[01:12:37.039 --> 01:12:45.221]  You know, this is all about surveillance, you know, total NSA, control grid, everything being surveilled, the secret agent spying on himself, you know, that's how duplicitous this is.
[01:12:47.921 --> 01:12:53.723]  Give us more of your thoughts on that, and then how the press is responding, because this is controversial.
[01:12:55.183 --> 01:13:00.664]  You know, I mean, the press really, I think it's a really hot topic right now, and I think it's a sort of serious issue.
[01:13:01.357 --> 01:13:07.540]  Not so much that this hasn't been going on, but sort of the flagrant, you know, disregard for the rights that we should be having.
[01:13:07.980 --> 01:13:13.263]  You know, it seems like right now we sort of have an administration that says, you know, we have no rights, we have no privacy.
[01:13:13.723 --> 01:13:15.484]  You know, they can sort of do whatever they want.
[01:13:16.264 --> 01:13:19.166]  And, you know, I think that's alarming when it becomes that overt.
[01:13:20.806 --> 01:13:25.549]  You know, that people are sort of starting to respond to that, and I think the press has really been picking up on that.
[01:13:26.089 --> 01:13:27.529]  And, you know, it's an element of the film.
[01:13:27.550 --> 01:13:28.710]  The film's not about that.
[01:13:28.730 --> 01:13:30.511]  It's sort of really more an atmosphere.
[01:13:31.252 --> 01:13:34.713]  And, you know, for me it really starts with the characters and the story.
[01:13:35.433 --> 01:13:38.394]  And, you know, it's a tragic story.
[01:13:38.594 --> 01:13:41.975]  And the people in this film are responding to their environment.
[01:13:42.495 --> 01:13:44.576]  And that's really the empathy that I feel towards those people.
[01:13:44.616 --> 01:13:46.336]  You know, they're sort of canaries in the coal mine.
[01:13:47.016 --> 01:13:49.717]  And, you know, they're trying to find freedom in a way.
[01:13:50.457 --> 01:13:54.618]  And, you know, they can't really find freedom in their society.
[01:13:54.638 --> 01:13:56.999]  So they're turning to other things, you know, like drugs and drugs.
[01:13:57.426 --> 01:13:59.307]  Conspiracies and things like that.
[01:13:59.627 --> 01:14:01.948]  They're really victims, and I view them empathetically.
[01:14:02.308 --> 01:14:17.775]  Keanu Reeves, really unprompted, a month or so ago at the Cannes Film Festival while you were there, it was in several major publications, talked about how, in comparison to the film, how America is turning into a police state and how we're losing our rights.
[01:14:19.875 --> 01:14:30.818]  You know, I don't really remember what he said.
[01:14:30.838 --> 01:14:35.700]  I think that we always have to be, you know, that we always have to be critical.
[01:14:36.060 --> 01:14:37.900]  And I think we have to be worried about our freedoms.
[01:14:38.160 --> 01:14:44.382]  And I think, you know, right now is a good time to start asking questions about, you know, really what's going on and what freedoms are we, you know, giving up.
[01:14:45.134 --> 01:14:58.086]  Do you think these big actors were attracted to this project for almost no money, by the way, ladies and gentlemen, because they had in some way in their life experienced some of the similar things that are in the film, so they had empathy?
[01:14:58.106 --> 01:15:02.490]  Yeah, you know, I mean, I think actors are probably really sensitive to sort of surveillance.
[01:15:02.510 --> 01:15:06.154]  You know, if you think about what they have to go through in sort of a daily...
[01:15:06.929 --> 01:15:11.592]  You know, saying that they're constantly being recorded and, you know, people are always watching them.
[01:15:11.652 --> 01:15:14.914]  Even if they're not being taken pictures of, they're being scrutinized and observed.
[01:15:15.614 --> 01:15:19.297]  And, you know, I think that they're just a little bit more sensitive to that.
[01:15:20.057 --> 01:15:30.664]  One of the main things that really attracted me to this sort of property and something that you and I talked about was, you know, French thinker Foucault's book Discipline and Punish.
[01:15:31.694 --> 01:15:34.315]  In that book, it's sort of a history of the penal system.
[01:15:34.355 --> 01:15:47.919]  He talks a lot about prison systems and how they arose in Western culture and really how they use surveillance and the threat of surveillance to control and manipulate people.
[01:15:48.560 --> 01:15:50.740]  That sort of spreads through all sorts of institutions.
[01:15:51.461 --> 01:15:56.622]  That also was written, I think, in the 70s and was really influential in my thinking about this project.
[01:15:56.642 --> 01:15:57.783]  I think it's a very real thing.
[01:15:57.803 --> 01:15:58.563]  It's about power.
[01:16:00.422 --> 01:16:03.163]  And the unbridled exercise of power.
[01:16:03.243 --> 01:16:07.343]  In the film, what percentage of the population is addicted to Substance D?
[01:16:07.803 --> 01:16:08.343]  Oh, like 20%?
[01:16:08.423 --> 01:16:09.784]  I can't remember.
[01:16:10.664 --> 01:16:12.224]  I'm going from memory, too.
[01:16:12.244 --> 01:16:19.666]  20% addicted to it, and the entire economy has now been geared towards surveilling, apprehending, and the drug turns people basically into zombies.
[01:16:20.246 --> 01:16:23.766]  And boy, there's quite a twist in the film, isn't there, Tommy?
[01:16:24.086 --> 01:16:27.707]  Yeah, I mean, I don't really want to talk too much giveaway spoilers because I don't want people to go...
[01:16:28.311 --> 01:16:30.553]  See it and, you know, enjoy it for the surprise that it is.
[01:16:30.694 --> 01:16:47.011]  But, you know, I mean, I think that there is something, you know, I'm sure you've talked about this a lot on your show, that's kind of creepy about the privatization of, you know, prison systems and, you know, really a very large incentive to put people in jail right now just sort of economically.
[01:16:47.672 --> 01:16:50.355]  And I think we're sort of treading on dangerous, you know, ground.
[01:16:51.019 --> 01:16:58.565]  If you go to the Scanner Darkly website and click on the link on the main page that says Substance D, this is the first thing you see and hear.
[01:16:58.845 --> 01:17:02.147]  Go ahead and roll the Substance D Alex clip.
[01:17:04.109 --> 01:17:06.210]  Where did Substance D come from?
[01:17:06.490 --> 01:17:07.631]  Why can't we stop it?
[01:17:08.071 --> 01:17:13.575]  The bigger this war gets, the more freedoms we lose, the more Substance D is on our streets.
[01:17:14.156 --> 01:17:15.357]  Can't you figure this out?
[01:17:18.891 --> 01:17:22.612]  Just a little taste of some of the atmosphere of the film, Tommy.
[01:17:22.792 --> 01:17:24.272]  Yeah, that's Alex Jones.
[01:17:24.652 --> 01:17:30.514]  And, you know, that was one of the few scenes that we added that wasn't initially in the book.
[01:17:30.854 --> 01:17:41.276]  And, you know, we felt that it was really appropriate for you to sort of play that part and be the voice kind of dissenting and trying to wake people up about what's going on.
[01:17:41.980 --> 01:17:51.384]  Well, Tommy, I can't tell you enough how much I appreciate you including me on this project and a little bit of consulting I did on some of the ideas, some of the look of the technology.
[01:17:51.724 --> 01:17:55.906]  As I said, when I looked at the work you guys had done, it was already far surpassed a lot of my research.
[01:17:56.246 --> 01:17:59.087]  You guys did a lot of research for this film on the control grip.
[01:18:00.788 --> 01:18:06.370]  You know, I don't know if it was a lot of research as much as it just is sort of interest.
[01:18:07.202 --> 01:18:08.763]  Well, avant-garde, something new, something entirely different.
[01:18:08.783 --> 01:18:14.465]  I mean, you have done something, you and Rick have created something with your animators and the actors and everybody that is avant-garde, Tommy.
[01:18:14.485 --> 01:18:15.125]  Well, thank you very much.
[01:18:31.647 --> 01:18:33.088]  Well, I mean, there's no other way to describe it.
[01:18:33.128 --> 01:18:36.169]  It is avant-garde at every level, every sinew of this film.
[01:18:36.449 --> 01:18:40.611]  Hey, Scanner Darkly, if you're lucky, it's in your city, and soon it'll be in all your cities.
[01:18:41.092 --> 01:18:44.113]  Hey, Scanner Darkly, we'll be right back with Tommy Pallott on the other side.
[01:18:44.553 --> 01:18:45.674]  We'll also play the trailer.
[01:18:45.734 --> 01:18:49.476]  It's not as powerful without the video, but we'll give you the audio.
[01:18:49.496 --> 01:18:49.936]  Stay with us.
[01:18:54.326 --> 01:18:57.610]  Do you remember when you could eat most anything and not worry about it?

[01:23:08.210 --> 01:23:09.771]  Rod Paul's schedule coming up the next hour.
[01:23:12.108 --> 01:23:18.573]  Here is one of the latest trailers that has just come out for A Scanner Darkly that you will see in theaters.
[01:23:18.593 --> 01:23:20.975]  I know every movie I go to, I see it.
[01:23:20.995 --> 01:23:22.376]  So here it is from Warner Independent.
[01:23:24.018 --> 01:23:25.659]  What does a scanner see?
[01:23:27.640 --> 01:23:28.301]  Into the head?
[01:23:29.702 --> 01:23:30.463]  Into the heart?
[01:23:36.708 --> 01:23:37.849]  Does it see into me?
[01:23:39.870 --> 01:23:40.191]  Clearly?
[01:23:42.532 --> 01:23:44.453]  We're darkly.
[01:23:53.619 --> 01:23:55.800]  And that's actually just the intro to the website.
[01:23:55.840 --> 01:24:02.084]  Later after Tommy leaves us in the next hour, I will play... I think I'll play both the trailers, but we're out of time to do that right now.
[01:24:02.904 --> 01:24:05.466]  Tommy, it was your idea to do this, so here it is.
[01:24:05.526 --> 01:24:09.248]  Here's a little clip of my appearance in Waking Life.
[01:24:09.268 --> 01:24:11.350]  It doesn't get any more anti-New World Order than this.
[01:24:11.690 --> 01:24:11.970]  Roll it.
[01:24:14.699 --> 01:24:15.799]  Death and taxes.
[01:24:16.260 --> 01:24:18.080]  Don't talk about politics or religion.
[01:24:18.620 --> 01:24:22.622]  This is all the equivalent of enemy propaganda rolling across the picket line.
[01:24:22.882 --> 01:24:23.942]  Lay down, GI.
[01:24:23.982 --> 01:24:24.962]  Lay down, GI.
[01:24:25.222 --> 01:24:27.003]  We saw it all through the 20th century.
[01:24:27.243 --> 01:24:30.264]  And now in the 21st century, it's time to stand up and realize.
[01:24:30.644 --> 01:24:31.905]  I'm concerned with the structure.
[01:24:31.925 --> 01:24:34.266]  I'm concerned with the systems of control.
[01:24:34.366 --> 01:24:37.728]  Those that control my life and those that seek to control it even more!
[01:24:37.768 --> 01:24:38.528]  I want freedom!
[01:24:38.548 --> 01:24:39.049]  That's what I want!
[01:24:39.129 --> 01:24:40.590]  And that's what you should want!
[01:24:52.495 --> 01:24:52.995]  We're good to go.
[01:24:53.015 --> 01:24:53.235]  I think?
[01:25:08.084 --> 01:25:12.107]  We have got to realize that we're being conditioned on a mass scale.
[01:25:12.627 --> 01:25:15.029]  Start challenging this corporate slave state.
[01:25:15.349 --> 01:25:17.451]  The 21st century is going to be a new century.
[01:25:17.751 --> 01:25:19.432]  Not the century of slavery.
[01:25:19.632 --> 01:25:25.997]  Not the century of lies and issues of no significance and classism and statism and all the rest of the modes of control.
[01:25:26.992 --> 01:25:31.393]  It's going to be the age of humankind standing up for something pure and something right.
[01:25:31.953 --> 01:25:35.594]  What a bunch of garbage liberals, Democrats, conservatives, Republicans.
[01:25:36.034 --> 01:25:37.295]  It's all there to control you.
[01:25:37.355 --> 01:25:39.335]  Two sides of the same coin.
[01:25:39.355 --> 01:25:44.557]  Two management teams getting for control the CEO job of Slavery Incorporated.
[01:25:44.857 --> 01:25:46.437]  The truth is out there in front of you.
[01:25:46.597 --> 01:25:48.578]  But they lay out this buffet of lies.
[01:25:48.838 --> 01:25:49.618]  I'm sick of it.
[01:25:49.638 --> 01:25:51.679]  And I'm not going to take a bite out of it.
[01:25:51.699 --> 01:25:52.259]  Do you got me?
[01:25:52.819 --> 01:25:54.480]  Persistence is not futile.
[01:25:54.520 --> 01:25:56.081]  We're going to win this thing.
[01:25:56.321 --> 01:25:57.661]  Human kind is too good.
[01:25:57.841 --> 01:25:59.262]  We're not a bunch of underachievers.
[01:25:59.282 --> 01:26:01.863]  We're going to stand up and we're going to be human beings.
[01:26:01.883 --> 01:26:04.204]  We're going to get fired up about the real thing.
[01:26:04.364 --> 01:26:05.505]  The things that matter.
[01:26:05.785 --> 01:26:10.207]  Creativity and the dynamic human spirit that refuses to submit.
[01:26:10.707 --> 01:26:11.267]  Well, that's it.
[01:26:11.287 --> 01:26:12.388]  That's all I've got to say.
[01:26:12.408 --> 01:26:13.228]  Continue your course.
[01:26:14.769 --> 01:26:17.470]  Well, Tommy, I tell you, that scene...
[01:26:18.354 --> 01:26:23.117]  I mean, Waking Life itself is evergreen, but again, I'm even more proud of you for making that film.
[01:26:23.137 --> 01:26:24.897]  You've done an excellent job, my man.
[01:26:25.738 --> 01:26:41.206]  Well, you know, that's really one of my favorite scenes of the whole movie, and you really do sort of touch on a lot of thoughts in a very sort of concise way, and I hope everybody really listens to that, and I hope that they sort of propagate that through the web.
[01:26:41.246 --> 01:26:42.507]  I mean, I know it's up on YouTube.
[01:26:42.567 --> 01:26:44.588]  I'm sure it's on your website.
[01:26:44.608 --> 01:26:46.669]  I just want people to see that.
[01:26:48.180 --> 01:27:03.050]  Tommy, I want to just briefly get back to a Scanner Darkly and its production, the Dick Estate, the Dick Daughters, on their website, really attribute the success of even getting this made, it had been attempted before, to you.
[01:27:03.130 --> 01:27:07.133]  How did you get all these actors and producers and people together?
[01:27:07.153 --> 01:27:09.795]  I mean, for those that don't know, the actors got paid what?
[01:27:10.155 --> 01:27:13.037]  Keanu Reeves gets like 40-something million, 100 million on some movies.
[01:27:13.517 --> 01:27:18.638]  Yeah, they did it all for scale, which is really, you know, the bare minimum that you can pay them.
[01:27:18.678 --> 01:27:21.139]  You know, I mean, it's... Was it like $60,000 or something apiece?
[01:27:21.539 --> 01:27:22.499]  Eh, something like that.
[01:27:22.619 --> 01:27:26.560]  I mean, it was... You know, the whole film was done for $8.5 million.
[01:27:26.740 --> 01:27:28.821]  This is not an establishment film, is my point.
[01:27:29.421 --> 01:27:32.762]  Yeah, you know, I mean, it really was a passion project for everybody involved.
[01:27:32.802 --> 01:27:39.223]  You know, I mean, it's kind of a good way to make a movie because you know that the people are there because they really want to be there.
[01:27:39.243 --> 01:27:42.744]  And I'm talking not just about the actors, but the crew, you know, the animators...
[01:27:43.297 --> 01:27:49.101]  Yeah, everybody involved was there because they really believed in this project that, you know, the Dick Estate cut their price.
[01:27:50.202 --> 01:27:57.587]  And, you know, it's a real pleasure to sort of work in that fashion because, you know, it really gives me a lot of hope.
[01:27:58.587 --> 01:28:00.769]  But, you know, I mean, planets align, and it's...
[01:28:01.451 --> 01:28:05.013]  Part of it's luck, part of it's just determination, you know, and just sort of getting it through.
[01:28:05.053 --> 01:28:08.215]  I mean, it certainly didn't come easy, and it certainly didn't come quickly.
[01:28:08.676 --> 01:28:11.958]  But I think that's like hardening metal in a fire in a furnace.
[01:28:12.018 --> 01:28:13.439]  I mean, this has really been forged.
[01:28:14.299 --> 01:28:16.981]  There were some storms, but you guys did it.
[01:28:17.281 --> 01:28:19.723]  Is it even sweeter, Tommy, that it was hard?
[01:28:21.253 --> 01:28:24.634]  You know, I don't know if I can really reflect on that right now.
[01:28:25.494 --> 01:28:27.415]  I'm coming off the end of it right now.
[01:28:27.435 --> 01:28:28.695]  It's always kind of a weird time.
[01:28:29.296 --> 01:28:31.516]  I'm just really happy that it's going out there in the public.
[01:28:32.056 --> 01:28:33.657]  A few more minutes on the other side.
[01:28:33.717 --> 01:28:37.878]  One or two final questions with the producer of A Scanner Darkly, Tommy Pallotta.
[01:28:43.840 --> 01:28:44.760]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.220 --> 01:28:46.841]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.761 --> 01:28:50.462]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.749 --> 01:28:57.333]  Are you looking for a one-stop shop to find all your favorite books and videos?
[01:28:57.613 --> 01:28:58.474]  Look no further.
[01:28:58.775 --> 01:29:01.337]  Northern Voice Bookstore has everything you need.
[01:29:01.758 --> 01:29:10.207]  Hundreds of titles from self-defense, survival, and financial freedom to history, politics, conspiracy, and everything you need to know about the New World Order.
[01:29:10.427 --> 01:29:10.868]  We're good to go.
[01:29:28.029 --> 01:29:28.389]  We're good to go.
[01:29:28.409 --> 01:29:28.830]  We're good to go.
[01:29:28.850 --> 01:29:29.230]  We're good to go.
[01:29:53.845 --> 01:29:57.409]  Do you know where the 78 potentially active volcanoes in the U.S.
[01:29:57.449 --> 01:29:57.949]  are located?
[01:29:58.170 --> 01:30:01.554]  And do you know the locations of the top 300 crime terrorist targets?
[01:30:01.774 --> 01:30:06.500]  You can find these answers and more in the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA.
[01:30:06.780 --> 01:30:11.766]  With the more than 50 interactive parameters, you can pinpoint natural and man-made disaster areas.
[01:30:11.966 --> 01:30:12.606]  We're good to go.
[01:30:31.676 --> 01:30:37.642]  The ideal location for cabins and vacation homes as well as safe and unsafe areas.
[01:30:37.942 --> 01:30:43.348]  Get Prudent Places USA for only $29 plus shipping by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:30:43.388 --> 01:30:45.870]  That's 888-803-4438 to order on the web or at BerkeyWater.com.
[01:30:53.482 --> 01:30:57.905]  Local folklore has recognized its amazing medicinal properties for thousands of years.
[01:30:58.065 --> 01:31:03.769]  But no one knew just how to preserve the nutritional benefits and market the total fruit commercially until Zango, that is.
[01:31:04.129 --> 01:31:09.033]  Zango is made from mangosteen, a fruit that grows in the subtropical climates of Southeast Asia.
[01:31:09.273 --> 01:31:13.776]  It contains xanthomes, the highest concentration of antioxidants found in nature.
[01:31:14.076 --> 01:31:14.697]  We're good to go.
[01:31:14.737 --> 01:31:14.877]  I think?
[01:31:35.200 --> 01:31:36.800]  Unleash the power of Zango today.
[01:31:37.040 --> 01:31:38.201]  Find out more by calling 888-203-6633.
[01:31:38.221 --> 01:31:38.421]  That's 888-203-6633.
[01:31:38.461 --> 01:31:40.221]  Or visit www.mangosteenmarket.com.
[01:31:40.241 --> 01:31:41.541]  That's M-A-N-G-O-S-T-E-E-N market.com.
[01:31:41.561 --> 01:31:42.522]  It's a powerful film.
[01:32:04.167 --> 01:32:05.087]  It's a beautiful film.
[01:32:05.167 --> 01:32:06.708]  It's a controversial film.
[01:32:06.728 --> 01:32:19.474]  And it's a film that deserves to be successful, that needs to be seen, that really does do a good job of getting people to think outside the box and see the panopticon-type control grid that's going in place all around us.
[01:32:19.514 --> 01:32:26.037]  In a few minutes, we're going to go to Bill Doyle, father of Joseph Doyle, one of the leaders of some of the 9-11 victims' families calling for a new investigation.
[01:32:26.790 --> 01:32:28.151]  He'll be joining us in just a few minutes.
[01:32:28.171 --> 01:32:29.911]  We appreciate him coming on with us.
[01:32:30.612 --> 01:32:38.655]  Tommy Pallotta, my friend, it was great collaborating with you in a small way on this film, and again, I just want to thank you for including me.
[01:32:38.996 --> 01:32:42.017]  It's great to get a phone call with someone and just inviting you on to a film.
[01:32:42.377 --> 01:32:49.160]  I mean, really, I don't have any lust to be involved in just a regular movie, say some cop movie or some action adventure.
[01:32:49.180 --> 01:32:55.203]  I mean, I could care less, but it is exciting, it is wonderful to be involved in something revolutionary, and
[01:32:56.063 --> 01:33:04.290]  Opening in seven major cities, 17 screens, and then building to hundreds and thousands of screens over the next month as it rolls out.
[01:33:04.390 --> 01:33:07.752]  Some of the sneak peeks going on right now in selected cities around the country.
[01:33:07.772 --> 01:33:11.215]  You can see it right here in Austin, Texas at the Arbor Cinema.
[01:33:12.476 --> 01:33:20.422]  Tommy Pallotta, just any closing comments you've got about the film and the long haul making it before you leave us?
[01:33:20.922 --> 01:33:25.945]  Well, you know, I just want to say maybe you wouldn't be so bad as a cop in an action movie, Alex.
[01:33:26.725 --> 01:33:27.746]  That would be pretty funny.
[01:33:27.766 --> 01:33:30.888]  Okay, Tommy.
[01:33:32.469 --> 01:33:36.751]  The point is, it's just that, I mean, obviously... No, I know what you're saying.
[01:33:36.771 --> 01:33:37.271]  I'm just joking.
[01:33:37.552 --> 01:33:43.955]  No, you know, what I want to say about this movie is that, you know, I just sort of want to express to everybody that this really is an independent film.
[01:33:44.356 --> 01:33:50.179]  You know, it is doing what's called a platform release, which means it's opening up in the city slowly.
[01:33:50.655 --> 01:33:51.176]  We're good to go.
[01:34:13.482 --> 01:34:19.207]  You know, this is an instance where, you know, people really are determining the fate of a film.
[01:34:19.488 --> 01:34:26.954]  I think it's fair to say the establishment, I don't want to get into any behind the scenes stuff, but I think it's fair to say, Tommy, the establishment's not too pleased with this.
[01:34:28.436 --> 01:34:30.317]  You know, I don't really know about that.
[01:34:30.378 --> 01:34:35.122]  You know, we didn't really encounter any sort of censorship or anything like that.
[01:34:35.788 --> 01:34:43.374]  So, you know, I think a lot of censorship is really self-censorship, and I think that that's sort of the dangerous, the real danger.
[01:34:44.394 --> 01:34:48.838]  Well, that's the panopticon, where you surveil yourself and enforce against yourself, keeping yourself in it.
[01:34:49.637 --> 01:34:51.780]  I think that that's a real threat.
[01:34:52.081 --> 01:34:57.327]  I think to express yourself is one of the most powerful tools that we have.
[01:34:57.848 --> 01:35:02.755]  I think it's important to stand up and be heard like you do on a daily basis.
[01:35:03.616 --> 01:35:04.257]  I make movies.
[01:35:04.277 --> 01:35:05.859]  They come out every couple of years.
[01:35:05.939 --> 01:35:06.780]  That's sort of my form.
[01:35:07.822 --> 01:35:23.716]  Well, that's the point I was trying to make by saying I don't get all excited about just regular movies, but these art films, these activist films, these avant-garde, just incredible things that you put together, the two films you put me in, you and Rick Linklater have, Tommy, I mean, for you, in closing,
[01:35:24.817 --> 01:35:25.958]  Well, those are kind words.
[01:35:48.044 --> 01:35:51.267]  Well, Tommy, it was great getting to see you at the 9-11 Symposium out in L.A.
[01:35:51.287 --> 01:35:56.171]  when you came out to visit with us, and it was great seeing you here at the premiere in Austin next week.
[01:35:56.191 --> 01:36:01.115]  Of course, you've lived in Austin on and off, and I hope someday you move back to Austin so we can hang out more.
[01:36:01.455 --> 01:36:06.519]  I don't see myself moving out to L.A., but I am going to come out and visit you so we can take that bike ride on the beach, my friend.
[01:36:06.899 --> 01:36:07.240]  Excellent.
[01:36:07.260 --> 01:36:09.321]  Well, you know, I'm always happy to support what you're doing, Alex.
[01:36:09.962 --> 01:36:10.722]  Tommy, God bless you.
[01:36:10.742 --> 01:36:11.863]  We'll talk to you soon, my friend.
[01:36:12.043 --> 01:36:12.344]  All right.
[01:36:12.384 --> 01:36:12.664]  Thank you.
[01:36:13.214 --> 01:36:26.956]  There goes Tommy Pallotta, one of my best friends, and he kind of orbits through town every few years when he's working on a particular film that's being produced in Austin, made in Austin, and he's lived here for the last two years, just moved to L.A.
[01:36:26.996 --> 01:36:27.696]  about six months ago.
[01:36:27.736 --> 01:36:28.977]  I really miss him.
[01:36:29.317 --> 01:36:33.757]  He is such a good person, and he knows all about the New World Order, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:36:33.858 --> 01:36:40.619]  All right, shifting gears, I apologize for him having to hold for four minutes, and he's an amazing individual in his own right.
[01:36:40.679 --> 01:36:42.459]  Bill Doyle, father of Joseph Doyle,
[01:36:43.072 --> 01:36:48.835]  ...who died on the 104th floor on 9-11.
[01:36:48.955 --> 01:36:49.636]  So tragic.
[01:36:49.716 --> 01:36:52.397]  And he represents one of the largest 9-11 victims' families.
[01:36:52.457 --> 01:36:56.759]  And they are outraged by the investigation that's been done.
[01:36:56.799 --> 01:36:58.260]  They're calling for a new investigation.
[01:36:58.760 --> 01:37:00.521]  And Mr. Doyle, thank you for coming on with us.
[01:37:01.142 --> 01:37:01.502]  Oh, thanks.
[01:37:01.642 --> 01:37:02.622]  It's a pleasure to be on.
[01:37:03.423 --> 01:37:03.903]  You bet.
[01:37:05.984 --> 01:37:07.365]  Sir, tell us about your son.
[01:37:07.405 --> 01:37:08.145]  Tell us about yourself.
[01:37:08.165 --> 01:37:10.907]  Tell us about your organization and some of the concerns you have.
[01:37:12.596 --> 01:37:18.800]  My concerns at the moment, there's plenty of concerns about 9-11 because there's no accountability on anything.
[01:37:20.020 --> 01:37:31.307]  But I'm really concerned about the TSA or the old FAA and the way they classify every bit of information with no control or any oversight.
[01:37:33.826 --> 01:37:42.970]  Well, I mean, describe the organization that you're the head of, how many people you represent, and then some of the case point examples of things that you're concerned about.
[01:37:43.890 --> 01:37:48.112]  Okay, I'm probably the largest advocate for the 9-11 families.
[01:37:48.212 --> 01:37:54.774]  I've run about six different support groups, okay, and numerous.
[01:37:56.835 --> 01:38:03.338]  I'm on the board of almost every family advocate group, and I reach 7,000 family victims.
[01:38:04.830 --> 01:38:05.050]  All right.
[01:38:05.770 --> 01:38:13.232]  What their concerns are, the secrecy about 9-11, and other things just classified or SSI'd.
[01:38:13.912 --> 01:38:20.514]  In the case of the TSA themselves, I'll give you an idea.
[01:38:20.534 --> 01:38:27.555]  During the Mazzelli trial, the defense attorneys and Mazzelli themselves, need all FAA information.
[01:38:29.076 --> 01:38:32.957]  Well, what occurred is the TSA
[01:38:35.152 --> 01:38:41.320]  Well, the American public or the 9-11 families do not see that information.
[01:38:42.621 --> 01:38:46.646]  How can we cater to an admitted al-Qaeda member?
[01:38:48.220 --> 01:38:49.902]  And not to the American public.
[01:38:50.082 --> 01:38:51.583]  Well, they have to cover up.
[01:38:52.003 --> 01:38:59.230]  My producers talked to you at length off air, sir, and you brought up the points of how the FBI had the credit card receipts.
[01:38:59.690 --> 01:39:03.333]  I mean, they had informants living with some of these people.
[01:39:03.513 --> 01:39:03.754]  U.S.
[01:39:03.814 --> 01:39:06.956]  Embassy said they were ordered to let them back in to the country.
[01:39:07.097 --> 01:39:13.142]  I'm sure you're aware that the head of the Defense Language School went public saying he was ordered to train some of these people.
[01:39:13.882 --> 01:39:15.924]  I mean, let's get down to brass tacks, sir.
[01:39:15.984 --> 01:39:18.325]  You have questions about the official story, don't you?
[01:39:19.586 --> 01:39:20.747]  Without question.
[01:39:20.787 --> 01:39:30.333]  I mean, if you want to believe what they're trying to snow you under on, like, the 9-11 Commission, that's all a fallacy.
[01:39:31.634 --> 01:39:32.994]  And that was a best-selling book.
[01:39:34.315 --> 01:39:38.118]  And you actually have Kip Hawley, who runs the TSA.
[01:39:38.178 --> 01:39:41.600]  He says he doesn't want to release information
[01:39:46.355 --> 01:39:48.717]  Well, what about the firefighters?
[01:39:49.378 --> 01:39:58.865]  They're on record Philadelphia News, other major papers, that they found three of the black boxes, really orange boxes, and that the FBI loaded them on four-wheelers and said, shut up, you never saw this.
[01:39:58.885 --> 01:40:05.731]  What about them ordering the FAA to shred the tapes and put them in different trash cans that day so they couldn't be put back together?
[01:40:06.031 --> 01:40:08.053]  I mean, it's just an ongoing cover-up, sir.
[01:40:08.133 --> 01:40:09.374]  I mean, do you smell a rat?
[01:40:10.129 --> 01:40:12.450]  Oh, there's a question there.
[01:40:13.130 --> 01:40:16.072]  There's something very questionable about this whole procedure.
[01:40:16.092 --> 01:40:23.835]  I mean, just the other day they make a big announcement that the, just to give you an idea, the steel used for 9-11, all the steel recovered.
[01:40:24.996 --> 01:40:29.518]  All of a sudden they're going to build a ferry boat from it.
[01:40:30.758 --> 01:40:32.399]  Okay, no, a battleship, excuse me.
[01:40:33.139 --> 01:40:36.961]  Well, how come this, okay, who wanted that steel,
[01:40:38.106 --> 01:40:43.929]  To examine it to see if there were any evidence of explosives or anything else on it.
[01:40:44.449 --> 01:40:46.290]  We're not allowed to get that steel.
[01:40:46.951 --> 01:40:53.834]  But now we're building a battleship named 9-11 with the same steel.
[01:40:54.855 --> 01:40:55.395]  Exactly.
[01:40:56.296 --> 01:40:59.457]  Bill Doyle, father of Joe Doyle, who died.
[01:40:59.477 --> 01:41:04.220]  We've got links to different websites and organizations that you're the head of or that you've organized and set up.
[01:41:04.240 --> 01:41:05.881]  And you raise a lot of really important questions.
[01:41:07.075 --> 01:41:11.298]  The Firefighter Engineering, the oldest firefighting publication in the country, said there was a cover-up with the steel.
[01:41:11.318 --> 01:41:14.240]  They shipped it to Asia, South Korea, and China under guard.
[01:41:14.721 --> 01:41:18.103]  But they did ferry some of it away into warehouses, later building memorials.
[01:41:18.644 --> 01:41:26.130]  Did you know some of that steel has been now tested conclusively from separate sites, peer-reviewed, and that it shows that thermate cutting charges were used?
[01:41:26.830 --> 01:41:28.252]  Oh, yes, I'm well aware of it.
[01:41:28.292 --> 01:41:31.794]  But isn't it amazing how they got it out of this country so quickly, within days?
[01:41:32.815 --> 01:41:33.175]  Okay?
[01:41:33.456 --> 01:41:34.537]  And now we're going to build a...
[01:41:35.675 --> 01:41:36.656]  A warship out of this?
[01:41:36.676 --> 01:41:39.139]  Something's wrong with that picture.
[01:41:39.339 --> 01:41:44.063]  Have you heard the tape where the man is in the North Tower on the cell phone?
[01:41:44.644 --> 01:41:48.628]  He goes, oh my God, you hear explosions, and then the buildings start collapsing?
[01:41:50.510 --> 01:41:55.875]  I know six of those individuals have talked to me directly.
[01:41:56.425 --> 01:41:58.926]  So you've talked to six... I've talked to firefighters on air.
[01:41:58.986 --> 01:42:00.387]  I've talked to others.
[01:42:00.487 --> 01:42:03.948]  Hundreds of people are on record saying they saw bombs going off.
[01:42:04.089 --> 01:42:08.411]  Can you comment on people's views of the victims' families on 9-11, sir?
[01:42:09.251 --> 01:42:11.992]  Um... Well, let's just look at one thing.
[01:42:12.032 --> 01:42:21.116]  I mean, it's documented proof, and all of a sudden now, it's not that even Tower 7 was not hit by a plane or any of the debris.
[01:42:21.917 --> 01:42:23.537]  It was up in flames, and then...
[01:42:25.222 --> 01:42:31.387]  The owner of the place, Larry Silverstein himself, ordered it to be pulled at 4 o'clock that afternoon.
[01:42:31.908 --> 01:42:32.248]  Pulled.
[01:42:32.628 --> 01:42:34.870]  And all of a sudden it exploded inside of one minute.
[01:42:35.891 --> 01:42:36.912]  Straight down.
[01:42:36.992 --> 01:42:37.612]  And pulled.
[01:42:37.652 --> 01:42:42.096]  It was even on the local news that day on NPR and others that, oh, they're going to bring the building down for safety.
[01:42:42.156 --> 01:42:44.758]  It takes weeks to set a building up to be imploded.
[01:42:45.198 --> 01:42:49.202]  Well, it got imploded inside of like a minute and a half.
[01:42:50.273 --> 01:42:50.513]  Right?
[01:42:50.573 --> 01:42:51.053]  That was it.
[01:42:51.213 --> 01:42:54.714]  Well, from the time he gave the order, it took like five seconds to fall.
[01:42:54.774 --> 01:42:55.394]  Exactly.
[01:42:55.414 --> 01:42:56.635]  It's incredible.
[01:42:57.855 --> 01:43:01.596]  But meanwhile, you look at the 9-11 Commission book, they don't see anything.
[01:43:01.796 --> 01:43:14.259]  I mean, the 9-11 Commission is probably the worst representation of the 9-11 families, or for that matter, all the American public, because it's a sham.
[01:43:14.319 --> 01:43:14.939]  It really is.
[01:43:15.039 --> 01:43:19.880]  We had tons of different questions that we asked them to, you know, ask,
[01:43:20.768 --> 01:43:22.169]  They wouldn't do it, okay?
[01:43:22.269 --> 01:43:24.910]  And the continuing cover-up is just beyond belief.
[01:43:25.530 --> 01:43:33.353]  Founded in September of 2001, the World Trade Center Unity Family Group is a non-profit 501c3, and I guess you were its founder and head.
[01:43:33.373 --> 01:43:35.174]  You say you represent over 7,000 people.
[01:43:36.634 --> 01:43:40.456]  What is the average view of those that you represent about 9-11 and the cover-up?
[01:43:41.656 --> 01:43:49.300]  What they want is... If you want to believe the 9-11 Commission story like a lot of us don't, okay?
[01:43:50.987 --> 01:43:53.629]  You really got to go look in the hard fetch.
[01:43:53.709 --> 01:43:58.053]  It almost looks like there was a conspiracy about 9-11 if you really look at all the facts.
[01:43:58.173 --> 01:44:00.115]  A lot of families feel the same way.
[01:44:02.737 --> 01:44:04.458]  What type of conspiracy, sir?
[01:44:04.478 --> 01:44:08.822]  Well, I mean, how do they pick September 11th itself?
[01:44:09.442 --> 01:44:15.227]  And then you look at that day they had these NORAD exercises.
[01:44:15.888 --> 01:44:27.852]  That morning, and not, you know, when you figure that a plane was known to, you know, be hijacked at 8.15, 8.20 that morning, the one that, you know, murdered my son, supposedly, okay?
[01:44:28.772 --> 01:44:30.032]  Or was it the explosion?
[01:44:30.633 --> 01:44:30.893]  Okay?
[01:44:31.413 --> 01:44:43.136]  How in God's name did nothing go out there, and when the, and if you want to believe that the Pentagon got hit an hour and a half later without nor I doing anything, or Flight 93 at 10.03 in the, uh,
[01:44:45.598 --> 01:44:47.679]  Which is an hour and a half afterwards as well.
[01:44:48.479 --> 01:44:49.139]  It's hard to believe.
[01:44:49.239 --> 01:44:50.219]  Where was NORAD?
[01:44:50.319 --> 01:44:52.580]  It was called, you know, a step down.
[01:44:52.680 --> 01:44:53.440]  Don't do anything.
[01:44:53.480 --> 01:44:54.120]  Let it happen.
[01:44:56.221 --> 01:45:05.184]  Well, I'm sure you're aware, sir, you're very informed that so-called hijackers were trained at Pensacola Naval Air Station, Monterey Defense Language School.
[01:45:06.404 --> 01:45:08.424]  Embassy heads said that they were flagged as terrorists.
[01:45:08.444 --> 01:45:13.486]  They were ordered to let them in by the CIA because they were, quote, part of a secret anti-terror operation.
[01:45:14.364 --> 01:45:18.189]  And then you have the flights all magically at 21% occupancy.
[01:45:18.209 --> 01:45:19.370]  You have NORAD stand down.
[01:45:19.390 --> 01:45:23.415]  You have CIA drills of hijacked planes being flown into buildings on the East Coast.
[01:45:24.241 --> 01:45:26.683]  You have CIA-connected insider trading.
[01:45:27.004 --> 01:45:31.128]  And then, do the Muslims have a motive to attack America and then bring the superpower down on them?
[01:45:31.488 --> 01:45:32.329]  Who has a motive?
[01:45:32.349 --> 01:45:37.054]  The PNAC document written by Dick Cheney September 2000 says we need a Pearl Harbor event.
[01:45:37.074 --> 01:45:44.120]  Brzezinski and the Grand Chess Board, former National Security Advisors, says we need a helpful Pearl Harbor event to mobilize the American people for World War III.
[01:45:46.314 --> 01:45:48.395]  Well, we'll just look at another thing.
[01:45:48.495 --> 01:45:57.160]  We had the FAA and all of a sudden what they do is come up with the new group, the TSA, which is probably the most corrupt group over there that classifies everything.
[01:45:57.680 --> 01:46:05.564]  And they put it underneath the watchful eye of Mr. Chertoff with the Department of Homeland Security.
[01:46:05.804 --> 01:46:14.029]  And believe it or not, I just had a 9-11 family member that got, received a matricule card from, a fraudulent one, from Mexico.
[01:46:14.693 --> 01:46:26.462]  They used this fraudulent non-matricial card to enter and actually go on the podium and got himself inside the Department of Homeland Security and actually made a long speech.
[01:46:26.502 --> 01:46:30.925]  That's another one of my groups that are, you know, fighting illegal immigration and what have you.
[01:46:31.926 --> 01:46:38.811]  Okay, and this is Department of Homeland Security, and they're supposed to be overseeing our transportation and all the fares.
[01:46:39.938 --> 01:46:46.682]  Or try to get some kind of sensible order into the government and all these agencies?
[01:46:47.183 --> 01:46:49.364]  Instead, all they're doing is surveilling the American people.
[01:46:50.425 --> 01:46:51.746]  That's what they're doing.
[01:46:51.846 --> 01:46:54.287]  Well, with the spying and what have you.
[01:46:54.407 --> 01:46:54.948]  Exactly.
[01:46:55.228 --> 01:46:57.770]  I mean, I don't know how many times I've been tapped.
[01:46:57.790 --> 01:46:58.990]  Certainly, I have been.
[01:47:00.231 --> 01:47:05.795]  But I just can't believe that... Give me an idea of another one.
[01:47:05.815 --> 01:47:06.175]  There was a...
[01:47:08.655 --> 01:47:17.497]  A film went out there of free hijackers beating FAA or security in Washington, D.C.
[01:47:18.297 --> 01:47:18.577]  Okay?
[01:47:19.338 --> 01:47:31.121]  Well, somehow or another, someone I really know and I'm very close and dear to got a copy of that tape before it got TSI, the TSA got it, or otherwise it would have became SSI.
[01:47:32.081 --> 01:47:33.981]  We released it to CBS TV.
[01:47:34.621 --> 01:47:34.981]  Okay?
[01:47:35.302 --> 01:47:37.002]  CBS played it nationally.
[01:47:37.557 --> 01:47:47.020]  Showing how these guys beat the FAA inspections for security control.
[01:47:47.440 --> 01:47:48.420]  They failed the WAN.
[01:47:48.460 --> 01:47:52.181]  They went through the detector twice.
[01:47:52.521 --> 01:47:58.423]  They failed the WAN twice and they actually got brought off to the side and were still allowed on those planes.
[01:47:58.843 --> 01:47:59.163]  Okay?
[01:47:59.927 --> 01:48:00.767]  We've all seen it.
[01:48:00.808 --> 01:48:07.491]  The World War II vet with the oxygen tanks has screamed at and searched, and people with huge turbines walk right on the plane.
[01:48:08.471 --> 01:48:13.934]  Because 9-11 is being used to enslave us, it has nothing to do with what we've been officially told.
[01:48:14.294 --> 01:48:19.797]  Boiling it down, sir, as the leader, as the founder of the largest 9-11 victims organization,
[01:48:20.417 --> 01:48:21.717]  You talk about a conspiracy.
[01:48:21.797 --> 01:48:23.138]  Who really had the motive for this?
[01:48:23.198 --> 01:48:24.038]  Who stands to gain?
[01:48:24.298 --> 01:48:25.559]  Who could really carry this out?
[01:48:25.819 --> 01:48:26.599]  I mean, spell it out.
[01:48:26.619 --> 01:48:30.380]  If you've got a point to finger at who you really think is behind 9-11, who is that?
[01:48:32.040 --> 01:48:40.683]  When I first helped sign on all these families into a lawsuit called 9-11 Families to Bankrupt Terrorism, it's a trillion dollar lawsuit trying to identify...
[01:48:41.943 --> 01:48:46.845]  Different banks, charities, and individuals, some of them being Saudis.
[01:48:47.045 --> 01:48:50.346]  George Bush's lawyer, James Baker, blocked you.
[01:48:50.927 --> 01:48:55.448]  James Baker, amazingly, is defending the Saudis.
[01:48:56.649 --> 01:49:05.052]  Prince Bandar Bush, I call him, he's actually James Baker, is representing the Saudis in this lawsuit.
[01:49:05.792 --> 01:49:06.032]  And when...
[01:49:10.287 --> 01:49:16.069]  When we entered this lawsuit, one of us was first contacted by this attorney, and he's probably one of the biggest attorneys in the world.
[01:49:16.249 --> 01:49:18.349]  He beat the tobacco industry nine years ago.
[01:49:18.369 --> 01:49:20.310]  Okay, his name is Rahm Ali.
[01:49:20.330 --> 01:49:24.411]  He says, Bill, you lost your son because of oil.
[01:49:24.431 --> 01:49:25.231]  Remember that.
[01:49:25.551 --> 01:49:26.431]  Oil and money.
[01:49:27.632 --> 01:49:39.035]  And, you know, when we look back at it, what's happening in Afghanistan with the KFDC pipeline and everything else that we know that's all about money and lining up different people's pockets,
[01:49:39.841 --> 01:49:41.683]  You're probably 100% correct.
[01:49:43.104 --> 01:49:45.065]  Is it an inside job, my friend?
[01:49:45.105 --> 01:49:46.867]  Think about that question when we get back.
[01:49:46.887 --> 01:49:47.988]  We'll be right back with our guest.
[01:49:53.556 --> 01:50:00.399]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[01:50:00.699 --> 01:50:02.079]  That's right folks, DVD.
[01:50:02.279 --> 01:50:04.480]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[01:50:04.640 --> 01:50:06.721]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[01:50:07.001 --> 01:50:11.923]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[01:50:12.263 --> 01:50:16.305]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[01:50:16.545 --> 01:50:18.326]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[01:50:18.406 --> 01:50:29.052]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and viable microchips, and much, much more.
[01:50:29.193 --> 01:50:31.094]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[01:50:31.294 --> 01:50:35.176]  Order your copy on VHS or DVD today and man the guns of the Infowar.
[01:50:35.256 --> 01:50:36.697]  Order right now by calling 1-888-2533-139.
[01:50:36.737 --> 01:50:36.937]  That's 888-2533-139.
[01:50:44.042 --> 01:50:45.004]  Again, that number, 888-253-3139.

[01:51:19.376 --> 01:51:20.457]  The Berkey Security Pack.
[01:51:20.497 --> 01:51:21.857]  A retail value of $518 for only $399.
[01:51:45.441 --> 01:51:46.242]  We're good to go.
[01:52:09.520 --> 01:52:10.161]  We're good to go.
[01:52:29.758 --> 01:52:30.238]  We're good to go.
[01:52:30.258 --> 01:52:30.418]  I think?
[01:52:56.050 --> 01:53:02.094]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:53:02.694 --> 01:53:05.696]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:08.919 --> 01:53:20.206]  Top former CIA analysts, German defense ministers, members of Blair's cabinet, physicists, engineers, Kevin Ryan, one of the underwriters for Underwriter Laboratories.
[01:53:20.226 --> 01:53:22.087]  They've all said the official story is a fraud.
[01:53:22.127 --> 01:53:23.408]  Bombs had to be in the buildings.
[01:53:23.868 --> 01:53:24.709]  Scientific fact.
[01:53:26.271 --> 01:53:29.033]  So-called Al-Qaeda couldn't carry out attacks on this scale.
[01:53:29.053 --> 01:53:29.674]  It's just a fact.
[01:53:29.974 --> 01:53:37.440]  Talking to Bill Doyle, who heads up, lost his son, heads up arguably, not arguably, the biggest 9-11 victims group.
[01:53:37.460 --> 01:53:41.684]  They're the folks that sued the Saudis, and then James Baker and the Bush administration blocked it.
[01:53:42.124 --> 01:53:43.406]  There you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:53:43.426 --> 01:53:43.966]  There you go.
[01:53:44.026 --> 01:53:45.647]  That's supposedly where the hijackers came from.
[01:53:45.848 --> 01:53:47.249]  Why not invade them instead of Iraq?
[01:53:48.320 --> 01:53:49.041]  Bill, come on.
[01:53:49.061 --> 01:53:50.622]  I mean, I can tell where you've gone with this.
[01:53:50.642 --> 01:53:53.264]  You came up without me asking it and said you thought there was a conspiracy.
[01:53:53.785 --> 01:53:55.967]  Bottom line is 9-11, an inside job.
[01:53:58.108 --> 01:54:03.833]  From everything that I look at, I'm sure there was a lot of complicity, at least, in the least.
[01:54:04.133 --> 01:54:06.195]  Okay, there had to be a lot of complicity.
[01:54:06.295 --> 01:54:14.342]  If you read and know all the facts, what I know or you might know, there's no way in hell that 19 of these hijackers
[01:54:14.952 --> 01:54:16.953]  You know, carry out this mission.
[01:54:17.273 --> 01:54:18.594]  Hey, Americans aren't wimps.
[01:54:18.674 --> 01:54:23.096]  I mean, four punks pull out box cutters on an airplane with a bunch of men on it.
[01:54:23.156 --> 01:54:24.276]  They're going to be going to the morgue.
[01:54:24.296 --> 01:54:26.017]  Ah, exactly.
[01:54:27.638 --> 01:54:30.559]  And there's just such a continuing cover-up.
[01:54:30.740 --> 01:54:33.861]  Why don't you just let the information about 9-11 be known?
[01:54:34.121 --> 01:54:39.124]  And then maybe this conspiracy type of thing would go away.
[01:54:39.244 --> 01:54:40.504]  But it's never going to go away.
[01:54:41.425 --> 01:54:44.086]  I don't think it can go away because they were complicit.
[01:54:44.702 --> 01:54:45.722]  They were complicit, yes.
[01:54:46.623 --> 01:54:48.143]  Can't go away because they were complicit.
[01:54:48.363 --> 01:54:49.283]  The government was complicit.
[01:54:49.904 --> 01:54:56.605]  Now, looking at this, though, with your 7,000 members, I'm sure you've talked to most if not all of them, run the gamut.
[01:54:56.745 --> 01:55:01.727]  What percentage, just guesstimation, would you say, believe 9-11 is an inside job to some extent?
[01:55:02.947 --> 01:55:03.467]  Maybe half.
[01:55:05.288 --> 01:55:05.548]  Maybe.
[01:55:07.401 --> 01:55:09.546]  Okay, half or not... Probably 50-50.
[01:55:09.666 --> 01:55:16.763]  And then, you know, a lot of people themselves are probably, you know, they're trying to move on in life, and a lot of them are seeking...
[01:55:17.341 --> 01:55:21.082]  Mental health organizations, I help a lot of these families with that.
[01:55:21.102 --> 01:55:22.222]  They're on drugs.
[01:55:22.762 --> 01:55:28.043]  They don't even want to live back to 9-11 because they just can't believe that our government failed us so badly.
[01:55:28.443 --> 01:55:32.304]  Also, if you shut up, you get a big payoff, don't you?
[01:55:33.744 --> 01:55:38.665]  Actually, the payoff itself with the victim's compensation is a joke.
[01:55:38.685 --> 01:55:43.666]  When you think about it, they took all insurance money and deducted it right from the top.
[01:55:43.886 --> 01:55:45.967]  And then half the money that any...
[01:55:47.103 --> 01:55:51.668]  And then the Red Cross and United Way got over $4 billion and kept over half of it.
[01:55:51.688 --> 01:55:53.830]  Well, at that time it was the September 11th fund.
[01:56:10.616 --> 01:56:12.558]  About Josh Kaufman.
[01:56:12.578 --> 01:56:14.640]  They collected almost $600 million.
[01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:17.042]  And you know what they gave the 9-11 family?
[01:56:18.243 --> 01:56:20.264]  Initially?
[01:56:20.284 --> 01:56:20.965]  $10,000 apiece.
[01:56:21.185 --> 01:56:23.127]  We're talking about 3,000 people, okay?
[01:56:23.147 --> 01:56:24.808]  That equals $30 million.
[01:56:25.329 --> 01:56:30.173]  Then when I blew the whistle on them and went on TV, I won't tell you what station...
[01:56:31.144 --> 01:56:34.587]  Well, they knew they were going on, and I was going to blow them out of the water.
[01:56:34.607 --> 01:56:35.828]  That was O'Reilly, wasn't it?
[01:56:37.349 --> 01:56:39.130]  Actually, it was then-offendee Steve Brian Williams.
[01:56:39.471 --> 01:56:39.671]  Yeah.
[01:56:40.131 --> 01:56:43.814]  Right, but they knew I was going on against Josh Copham.
[01:56:43.894 --> 01:56:48.078]  All of a sudden, they said, oh, we're going to send each family another $10,000, okay?
[01:56:48.718 --> 01:56:51.100]  But this was when there was real need for these families.
[01:56:51.240 --> 01:56:56.985]  Which is a fraction of the, I mean, total, it was what, $4 billion that the big charities got?
[01:56:58.412 --> 01:57:03.393]  4 billion bucks and you got, oh, here's 10,000, which is a fraction of it.
[01:57:03.453 --> 01:57:09.734]  A lot of people, you know, and I hate when I see someone on the corner and say, oh, how much money did you get?
[01:57:09.774 --> 01:57:11.195]  Hey, it's not about money.
[01:57:11.235 --> 01:57:12.575]  I want accountability.
[01:57:12.735 --> 01:57:13.455]  I understand.
[01:57:13.615 --> 01:57:16.696]  I totally understand.
[01:57:16.736 --> 01:57:18.996]  But the money thing shows how greedy these people are.
[01:57:19.516 --> 01:57:21.617]  Well, even to some of the...
[01:57:23.857 --> 01:57:26.559]  9-11 Public, they just say, oh, how much money do you have?
[01:57:26.579 --> 01:57:28.380]  You couldn't put a price on my wife's life.
[01:57:28.400 --> 01:57:28.780]  Stay there.
[01:57:29.061 --> 01:57:29.581]  Stay there, sir.
[01:57:29.601 --> 01:57:30.001]  We've got to break.
[01:57:30.021 --> 01:57:31.462]  We'll be back in 70 seconds.
[01:57:33.824 --> 01:57:37.806]  Order a copy of this show for your friends and family at GCNlive.com or call 877-300-7645.
[01:57:37.826 --> 01:57:38.086]  Hello?
[01:57:38.126 --> 01:57:38.386]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.298 --> 01:57:52.359]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:53.079 --> 01:57:54.200]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.840 --> 01:57:55.680]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.401 --> 01:57:57.321]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.982 --> 01:58:01.623]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.164 --> 01:58:06.226]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:15.277 --> 01:58:20.522]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen, now into hour number three on this amazing Friday edition.
[01:58:20.623 --> 01:58:29.091]  First hour, we had a poor lady on from Piscataway, New Jersey, where they've got land worth over 70 plus million dollars on the tax rolls.
[01:58:29.672 --> 01:58:35.417]  The government's taking it to build, they admit, facilities on they want to just give to private interest.
[01:58:36.819 --> 01:58:38.981]  And they've been told they're not going to be given any money.
[01:58:40.120 --> 01:58:45.785]  The government's going to charge them money because of their organic farm, quote, calling the organic farm toxic waste.
[01:58:46.886 --> 01:58:47.847]  This is how they operate.
[01:58:47.887 --> 01:58:50.850]  Then we had the producer on from a scanner darkly.
[01:58:51.150 --> 01:58:58.116]  Congressman Ron Paul is scheduled coming up in the last half hour of the broadcast today to talk about a host of issues, the economy, the war.
[01:58:58.857 --> 01:59:00.598]  Congressman from the 14th District of Texas.
[01:59:01.079 --> 01:59:06.063]  Right now, for the next 14 minutes or so, we're going to let him go at 15 after, is Bill Doyle.
[01:59:07.129 --> 01:59:12.073]  And this is the guy who got the families together, the biggest families organization.
[01:59:12.834 --> 01:59:14.875]  They sued the Saudis, if you believe the official story.
[01:59:14.895 --> 01:59:19.799]  You know, 15 or 14 of the 19 hijackers came from there, all the funding, the connections.
[01:59:20.599 --> 01:59:31.508]  And the Bush administration with the federal courts and James Baker, the Bush family lawyer, and the Carlyle Group lawyer, went after this group and blocked them from going after the Saudis.
[01:59:32.128 --> 01:59:34.510]  And instead, Bush invades an innocent country called Iraq.
[01:59:35.584 --> 01:59:37.867]  This is the type of stuff we're dealing with, and you heard him.
[01:59:38.087 --> 01:59:41.392]  About half the families think it's an inside job, and he's saying, how else could it be?
[01:59:41.432 --> 01:59:43.054]  All the evidence shows that.
[01:59:44.737 --> 01:59:47.038]  Sir, have you seen the documentaries that have been made about 9-11?
[01:59:47.118 --> 01:59:50.119]  Have you seen Road to Tyranny, Martial Law, Loose Change 2?
[01:59:50.499 --> 01:59:52.980]  I mean, obviously, I've been asking you questions about 9-11.
[01:59:53.000 --> 01:59:53.940]  You're extremely informed.
[01:59:54.181 --> 01:59:54.841]  Why wouldn't you be?
[01:59:54.861 --> 01:59:55.961]  You know, you lost your son.
[01:59:56.361 --> 02:00:08.966]  I mean, what is it like knowing that there are people out there who are guilty, clearly guilty of passive complicity at the bare minimum, who have gotten away with this 9-11 and are using it to take our freedoms and kill America's soul?
[02:00:09.911 --> 02:00:15.015]  Well, we can go right back to the FBI director in the Mazzelli trial itself.
[02:00:15.895 --> 02:00:25.601]  He testified that he wrote a memo, and he was sentenced 60, 70 times to his higher-ups, a warning about the al-Qaeda being in the United States, okay?
[02:00:26.322 --> 02:00:31.165]  And the person higher up actually had to testify in the Mazzelli trial, and you know what he said?
[02:00:31.860 --> 02:00:34.562]  Well, he didn't pass it on because he valued his job.
[02:00:35.142 --> 02:00:36.663]  Give me a break.
[02:00:36.703 --> 02:00:46.490]  In 2003, they gave record cash bonuses to FBI deputy directors who blocked Agent Wright, Rowley, and others who were specifically about to stop the supposed hijackers.
[02:00:47.211 --> 02:00:48.472]  Calling Rowley's a sweetheart.
[02:00:48.512 --> 02:00:50.193]  I'm in touch with her all the time.
[02:00:51.141 --> 02:00:58.004]  You know, what they did to her is they more or less forced her out of the job.
[02:00:58.124 --> 02:01:02.146]  But then give giant cash bonuses to the people that targeted her and others.
[02:01:02.807 --> 02:01:03.967]  Oh yeah, without question.
[02:01:04.067 --> 02:01:04.688]  Or promotions.
[02:01:05.088 --> 02:01:05.768]  Without question.
[02:01:05.968 --> 02:01:08.350]  Keep your mouth shut and we'll promote you and you'll make a lot of money.
[02:01:09.350 --> 02:01:10.571]  They told Sybil Edmonds that.
[02:01:10.631 --> 02:01:11.331]  Comments on her?
[02:01:12.352 --> 02:01:15.173]  Well, Sybil's another beautiful person and
[02:01:16.399 --> 02:01:18.080]  I helped her on her flight as well.
[02:01:18.100 --> 02:01:23.683]  I've been down to Washington quite a few times with her, and I'll continue to do so because she's on the right track.
[02:01:23.703 --> 02:01:25.784]  She knows a lot of information.
[02:01:26.384 --> 02:01:35.189]  However, our government has her underneath a gag order, and I'm just wondering when the bellow of those things is just going to say, hey,
[02:01:35.899 --> 02:01:37.120]  I'm gagging myself.
[02:01:37.420 --> 02:01:38.520]  Do whatever you want with me.
[02:01:38.600 --> 02:01:39.961]  Well, she said this.
[02:01:40.681 --> 02:01:41.141]  Exactly.
[02:01:41.181 --> 02:01:42.342]  She's done this on this show.
[02:01:42.382 --> 02:01:50.945]  She said, I can't talk about the specifics of this case, but let's say hypothetically the government really was controlling the terrorists and dealing drugs and running weapons and was behind it.
[02:01:52.986 --> 02:01:58.708]  Well, if you really look into the 28 pages of the 2002 joint inquiry, which was bipartisan,
[02:01:59.528 --> 02:02:20.114]  Okay, I believe that those pages that address who financed 9-11, which they don't want to let you know, if you really look, and I'm hearing this from certain sources, that some of those pages were that the United States government sent tons of money over to Pakistan.
[02:02:20.174 --> 02:02:27.536]  Pakistan themselves turned around and gave the money to their ISI, who were running terrorist camps in Afghanistan,
[02:02:28.112 --> 02:02:32.413]  To come back over to the United States to murder our loved ones.
[02:02:32.794 --> 02:02:34.294]  General Mahmoud Ahmed.
[02:02:34.834 --> 02:02:38.015]  We'll talk about that on the other side in the final segment with our guest.
[02:02:38.255 --> 02:02:42.477]  We'll give you website addresses and how you can help this group valiantly get the truth out about 9-11.
[02:02:46.545 --> 02:02:53.929]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[02:02:54.189 --> 02:02:58.931]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[02:02:59.151 --> 02:03:04.814]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[02:03:05.054 --> 02:03:09.578]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[02:03:09.798 --> 02:03:16.944]  The cashless society control grid, impenetrable microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[02:03:16.965 --> 02:03:21.508]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[02:03:21.669 --> 02:03:24.191]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[02:03:24.411 --> 02:03:31.117]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.
[02:03:31.357 --> 02:03:36.605]  Order online now at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling 1-888-253-3139.
[02:03:36.625 --> 02:03:37.046]  That's 888-253-3139.
[02:03:45.791 --> 02:03:47.412]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:03:47.532 --> 02:03:51.674]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[02:03:51.774 --> 02:03:54.656]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[02:03:54.736 --> 02:04:01.459]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[02:04:01.639 --> 02:04:04.641]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[02:04:04.841 --> 02:04:07.242]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[02:04:07.362 --> 02:04:12.085]  Black Berkey elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites, but also remove
[02:04:12.265 --> 02:04:26.832]  Try halomethanes and volatile organic elements such as aprazine, benzene, chloride, and chloroform, MTBE, radon-222, foul taste and obnoxious odors like sulfur, even nitrates, and unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum aren't extracted.
[02:04:26.992 --> 02:04:33.675]  Supercharge your gravity filter today and order a two-pack of Black Berkey Purification Elements for only $96 or a four-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at 888-
[02:04:36.596 --> 02:04:37.057]  803-4438 That's 888-803-4438
[02:04:45.706 --> 02:04:49.789]  If the cost of your prescriptions are getting out of control, you want to listen carefully to this.
[02:04:50.089 --> 02:04:57.875]  rxdrugcard.com is a simple, innovative program designed to give individuals the same purchasing power as large HMOs and insurance companies.
[02:04:58.075 --> 02:05:07.943]  As a member of rxdrugcard.com, you'll enjoy savings of up to 80% on all prescription medications at over 52,000 USA pharmacies, including Walmart, Walgreens, and Eckerd's.
[02:05:08.063 --> 02:05:08.503]  We're good to go.
[02:05:28.902 --> 02:05:33.623]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:05:33.643 --> 02:05:35.364]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:05:59.398 --> 02:06:03.560]  My new film, Terror Storm, is out on DVD at InfoWars.com.
[02:06:04.140 --> 02:06:07.321]  We detail, without a shadow of a doubt, London bombings were an inside job.
[02:06:07.361 --> 02:06:10.182]  We have MI5 agents on record covering it.
[02:06:10.982 --> 02:06:21.046]  We get into the latest 9-11 information and declassified CIA.gov documents where they admit our governments carried out terror attacks in foreign countries to blame it on their enemies many times in the past.
[02:06:21.466 --> 02:06:22.527]  We cover how Hitler did it.
[02:06:22.567 --> 02:06:23.687]  We cover the USS Liberty.
[02:06:23.707 --> 02:06:24.707]  We cover a bunch of other issues.
[02:06:25.048 --> 02:06:28.449]  It is my best film available at InfoWars.com right now.
[02:06:30.174 --> 02:06:36.941]  Bill Doyle heads up the largest 9-11 victims organization, the World Trade Center United Family Group.
[02:06:36.961 --> 02:06:40.645]  We have links to their organizations at InfoWars.com right now.
[02:06:41.205 --> 02:06:46.170]  Bill Doyle, I've been watching you on the news, reading what you've said over the last four, almost five years.
[02:06:46.230 --> 02:06:51.736]  I've seen your metamorphosis, your awakening to 9-11, all the evidence pointing towards an inside job.
[02:06:52.616 --> 02:06:52.937]  I think so.
[02:07:11.000 --> 02:07:15.224]  That day, I don't think anybody will ever forget, okay?
[02:07:15.284 --> 02:07:31.678]  And that's what probably led me into trying to get the truth to be known and put the roadblocks between us senators and congressmen that have been in the unbelief and then all these fraudulent agencies that are out there that are created just through hard knowledge.
[02:07:31.718 --> 02:07:33.640]  It's unbelievable.
[02:07:35.563 --> 02:07:37.184]  I mean, here, I'll give you an instance.
[02:07:37.264 --> 02:08:02.402]  In October 2004, the National Security Archive, the D.C.-based nonprofit that obtains government documents through the Freedom of Information Act, wrote the TSA, which is the old FAA, okay, and to release the text or even the titles of the five aviation warnings given to the airlines just before the 9-11 attacks.
[02:08:02.782 --> 02:08:05.304]  The TSA says, no, you can't have them.
[02:08:05.771 --> 02:08:11.313]  However, they're referred to in the best-selling 9-11 Commission report so many times, it's beyond belief.
[02:08:12.033 --> 02:08:18.235]  I mean, the TSA themselves had no... They classify everything.
[02:08:18.435 --> 02:08:28.778]  Well, as you know... As you know, Mr. Doyle, the 9-11 Commission claimed that Tower 1 and 2 were hollow and had no support columns in them.
[02:08:29.138 --> 02:08:31.319]  Okay, I worked in those buildings.
[02:08:31.499 --> 02:08:34.100]  Exactly, though we have video footage of the construction.
[02:08:34.120 --> 02:08:34.900]  It had the biggest...
[02:08:35.666 --> 02:08:41.474]  Four-foot-plus columns, 47 of them, of any buildings ever built up until this time.
[02:08:41.534 --> 02:08:47.021]  They were overbuilt, but they just lie and say they don't have columns, and they make TV specials about it.
[02:08:47.442 --> 02:08:48.764]  Well, we were just thinking about this.
[02:08:48.784 --> 02:08:50.826]  We had a plane that crashed into the Empire State Building.
[02:08:50.846 --> 02:08:51.988]  That didn't go down, did it?
[02:08:52.896 --> 02:08:56.197]  Meanwhile, we have two planes that fly into the towers, and all of a sudden they're blown up.
[02:08:56.297 --> 02:08:56.497]  What?
[02:08:56.677 --> 02:08:58.378]  Within an hour, an hour and a half?
[02:08:58.818 --> 02:08:59.778]  It's not even possible.
[02:08:59.958 --> 02:09:04.900]  And we have people standing in the holes where the supposed fire now has burned out to nothing, standing there.
[02:09:05.100 --> 02:09:11.041]  They're not melting, but then huge pillars, feet from them, shatter and explode in total unison as they collapse.
[02:09:11.081 --> 02:09:14.082]  Before the break, you brought up General Mahmoud Ahmed, $100,000 wired to Mohammed Adab.
[02:09:17.528 --> 02:09:18.829]  Mahmoud Ahmed had only been to the U.S.
[02:09:18.849 --> 02:09:19.610]  twice in his life.
[02:09:19.910 --> 02:09:35.782]  The second time was that week, meeting with Porter Goss, the heads of House and Senate Intelligence Committee, Bob Graham meeting with the CIA director, George Tenet, meeting with all of these people the week before while his head of intelligence wires $100,000 to the supposed lead hijacker.
[02:09:35.802 --> 02:09:42.767]  And you're saying you've got government contacts that are saying that those excise pages that they don't want to release are talking about our government directly funding them?
[02:09:43.962 --> 02:09:53.109]  Well, what I've heard from different people pretty well in the know that the substantial amount of money went to Pakistan, okay?
[02:09:53.850 --> 02:09:56.271]  Probably to overthrow the Taliban or whatever.
[02:09:56.772 --> 02:10:00.835]  Pakistan gave the money to the ISI who turned around and used money.
[02:10:01.744 --> 02:10:05.467]  That they received from Pakistan or really our U.S.
[02:10:05.507 --> 02:10:05.908]  government.
[02:10:06.428 --> 02:10:11.112]  But we know the coup of 2000 with Misharraf, Perez Misharraf being put in was staged by our government.
[02:10:11.132 --> 02:10:15.035]  We know ISI is a glove on the hand of the Central Intelligence Agency.
[02:10:15.535 --> 02:10:17.437]  Oh, yeah, no, without question.
[02:10:17.797 --> 02:10:21.640]  And I think that's probably one of the most damaging months and probably...
[02:10:23.027 --> 02:10:35.274]  It would prove conclusively that the United States themselves might have been probably complicit or actually enabled 9-11 if that information in those 28 pages were known.
[02:10:35.334 --> 02:10:47.020]  I mean, they actually financed in a perverted way all the hijackers or these terrorists in Afghanistan to take training lessons to come here and kill innocent people.
[02:10:47.661 --> 02:10:48.981]  But it was with U.S.
[02:10:49.101 --> 02:10:49.962]  dollars that did it.
[02:10:51.118 --> 02:11:06.585]  Well, when people like the former Marine Corps historian and former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense, Colonel Ronald D. Ray, come on this show and say the official story is a fraud and the dog doesn't hunt, I mean, every week more prominent people, sir, come on this broadcast and say it's got to be an inside job.
[02:11:06.905 --> 02:11:08.186]  What are the crooks that carried it out?
[02:11:08.206 --> 02:11:11.267]  Do you think they're starting to get a little bit scared?
[02:11:11.307 --> 02:11:19.931]  Well, I hope America listens, and really what we have to do is all stay united, and when you see different things, support your senators, support your congressmen,
[02:11:21.416 --> 02:11:22.136]  You've got to do it.
[02:11:22.296 --> 02:11:27.877]  I mean, just don't let, you know, shove things under the rug and say, oh, let the next person do it.
[02:11:27.997 --> 02:11:31.158]  You've got to be proactive.
[02:11:31.678 --> 02:11:38.960]  And unfortunately, what I see in the United States, even on 9-11 issues, a lot of them, people say, oh, let the other person do it.
[02:11:39.000 --> 02:11:43.060]  Well, if there's only a dozen, I'd rather see two million people doing it.
[02:11:43.160 --> 02:11:45.681]  And then all of a sudden, maybe we could advocate for some change.
[02:11:46.021 --> 02:11:50.622]  What would a real 9-11 investigation, who would carry it out, what would it look like?
[02:11:52.673 --> 02:12:00.377]  Personally, like, what we wanted originally, one of the Jersey girls, Kristen Brett-Mizer, is a brilliant person, okay?
[02:12:00.458 --> 02:12:07.382]  She was the spearhead, one of the Jersey girls, and I spoke to them probably nightly when we were fighting for the 9-11 Commission.
[02:12:08.202 --> 02:12:15.227]  Why couldn't there have been, on the 9-11 Commission, some people like Kristen Brett-Mizer, myself or whatever,
[02:12:16.479 --> 02:12:20.222]  Feeling the pulse of the families, knowing the questions that wanted to be asked.
[02:12:20.683 --> 02:12:23.505]  Kristen is a brilliant woman.
[02:12:23.605 --> 02:12:24.966]  She's an attorney.
[02:12:25.746 --> 02:12:29.409]  Why wouldn't they allow family participation to be part of the 9-11 community?
[02:12:29.489 --> 02:12:37.315]  And they lost, we're talking about people who lost family, then Ann Coulter, the neocon, comes out and savages these good women.
[02:12:37.335 --> 02:12:38.076]  What do you think about that?
[02:12:38.976 --> 02:12:42.419]  Ann Coulter, you know, it's all about that, you know,
[02:12:42.935 --> 02:12:43.655]  Great American Way.
[02:12:43.675 --> 02:12:59.102]  It's all about selling books, and all she had to do was berate a couple of people that I really thought highly of, and when I really look at it, even my wife, who tried to stay nonpartisan or don't get involved in these things, she says, you know something?
[02:12:59.822 --> 02:13:01.963]  That was a conservative Republican plant.
[02:13:02.343 --> 02:13:03.324]  That's what my wife said.
[02:13:04.815 --> 02:13:05.775]  Well, I'll say this.
[02:13:05.935 --> 02:13:15.279]  To cold-bloodedly attack innocent women who lost husbands and sons and daughters and mothers and brothers just because it'll sell some books, I mean, these people are sick.
[02:13:15.299 --> 02:13:18.380]  There's a lot of sick people out there.
[02:13:19.800 --> 02:13:22.561]  Well, in closing, sir, anything else you'd like to add, Mr. Doyle?
[02:13:22.581 --> 02:13:23.842]  We appreciate your comments.
[02:13:24.162 --> 02:13:33.665]  No, I'd like to just say, like, if the listeners could actually contact their senators, there's a bill that's most important that maybe we can get some of the truth to be known.
[02:13:34.457 --> 02:13:37.618]  From the TSA, it's bill number 5441.
[02:13:38.138 --> 02:13:42.439]  It's HR 5441, section 525.
[02:13:43.419 --> 02:13:51.961]  Just to call the senators who came up with another version just to keep secrecy, and they admitted this to section 525, which the House wants.
[02:13:53.081 --> 02:13:57.062]  If we can call our senators and say, hey, listen, you want section 525 of the HR 5441 bill,
[02:14:02.738 --> 02:14:03.839]  Uh, am I what?
[02:14:04.039 --> 02:14:05.280]  I'm sorry?
[02:14:27.774 --> 02:14:36.241]  There are people in the establishment, people in the criminal networks that were involved in 9-11 listening to this show, guaranteed, sir, listening to the audio that we'll post.
[02:14:36.561 --> 02:14:39.724]  What would you like to say to those that were involved in the attacks and they're listening?
[02:14:40.684 --> 02:14:44.968]  What I'd say to them is, well, why don't you come forward and take your medicine, okay?
[02:14:45.048 --> 02:14:53.494]  I mean, I know seven or eight thousand families over here that are still grieving, and what 9-11 created is horrific.
[02:14:53.555 --> 02:14:53.735]  I mean...
[02:14:54.867 --> 02:14:57.109]  I mean, tons of business went out, right?
[02:14:57.429 --> 02:15:03.633]  And for them to be conflicted in this, they all ought to be behind bars.
[02:15:05.535 --> 02:15:07.516]  Well, I appreciate you joining us, Mr. Doyle.
[02:15:07.836 --> 02:15:09.738]  God bless you, and we really support your efforts.
[02:15:09.758 --> 02:15:12.420]  We have links to your organizations on Infowars.com.
[02:15:12.740 --> 02:15:13.680]  Go with God, my friend.
[02:15:14.021 --> 02:15:14.841]  Okay, thanks very much.
[02:15:15.181 --> 02:15:15.902]  Vaya con Dios.
[02:15:17.243 --> 02:15:24.308]  Before I end this segment, do you understand, folks, that if we do not expose 9-11, the same criminals that carried it out are going to keep doing it?
[02:15:25.145 --> 02:15:26.678]  They're going to do it very, very soon.
[02:15:28.072 --> 02:15:34.457]  I don't know what I have to say or do to get you to go to Infowars.com and get a film I'm so proud of I can't even describe it.
[02:15:34.877 --> 02:15:36.639]  Terror Storm is my crowning achievement.
[02:15:36.679 --> 02:15:38.240]  It is the best film we've ever made.
[02:15:38.580 --> 02:15:43.144]  It is so unbelievably powerful, so unbelievably professional, so unbelievably slick.
[02:15:43.564 --> 02:15:47.847]  It will really wake people up, and it's up to you to get this tool and get it out to people.
[02:15:47.907 --> 02:15:48.027]  It's $19.95.
[02:15:48.508 --> 02:15:50.149]  We've had a lot of expenses.
[02:15:50.569 --> 02:15:52.551]  I've really exhausted a lot of my resources.
[02:15:53.011 --> 02:15:54.552]  Please go to Infowars.com right now.
[02:15:56.497 --> 02:15:58.558]  Secure your copy of Terror Storm.
[02:15:59.198 --> 02:16:03.860]  We have 150-something left of the t-shirts from the 9-11 event that say 9-11 Neocon Agenda.
[02:16:03.880 --> 02:16:04.520]  Beautiful front.
[02:16:04.880 --> 02:16:08.381]  On the back it says Face the Facts, InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanta.com.
[02:16:08.401 --> 02:16:09.221]  Those are going to go quick.
[02:16:10.002 --> 02:16:11.202]  Please go to the website.
[02:16:11.342 --> 02:16:12.562]  We really never ask you for support.
[02:16:12.582 --> 02:16:13.483]  We just say get the films.
[02:16:13.543 --> 02:16:14.223]  So please do that.
[02:16:14.623 --> 02:16:15.423]  We need your support.
[02:16:15.543 --> 02:16:17.104]  But that is side issue.
[02:16:17.804 --> 02:16:19.286]  This video, I'm so proud of it.
[02:16:19.346 --> 02:16:20.306]  I just want you to see it.
[02:16:20.367 --> 02:16:22.008]  I want you to share in the work we did.
[02:16:22.028 --> 02:16:27.472]  11 months of working up here until 2, 3, some nights 4 in the morning, some nights 6 in the morning.
[02:16:27.532 --> 02:16:28.873]  It's insane.

[02:17:26.583 --> 02:17:28.005]  We know, we've counted the cost.
[02:17:28.025 --> 02:17:29.085]  We know this is life and death.
[02:17:29.526 --> 02:17:31.427]  We want you to get your head screwed on and join us.
[02:17:31.908 --> 02:17:34.590]  Get your head screwed on straight and join us in this fight.
[02:17:35.010 --> 02:17:36.231]  Help us fight the New World Order.
[02:17:36.311 --> 02:17:37.392]  Expose these murderers.
[02:17:37.632 --> 02:17:38.293]  We're winning.
[02:17:38.573 --> 02:17:39.594]  People are coming forward.
[02:17:39.614 --> 02:17:40.294]  They're waking up.
[02:17:40.374 --> 02:17:40.915]  We're winning.
[02:17:46.047 --> 02:17:56.773]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.
[02:17:56.953 --> 02:18:04.518]  The revolutionary Berkey Light with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:18:04.798 --> 02:18:07.940]  Farmful or unwanted chemicals are reduced to below detectable levels.
[02:18:08.100 --> 02:18:08.480]  We're good to go.
[02:18:26.761 --> 02:18:32.704]  The rechargeable LED lighting system is beautiful as a nightlight and as necessary in emergency situations.
[02:18:32.924 --> 02:18:36.886]  Get the Berkey Light, a transparent water filter for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:18:36.906 --> 02:18:37.566]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[02:18:37.606 --> 02:18:39.247]  Currency, devaluation, inflation.
[02:18:39.287 --> 02:18:39.967]  One and the same.
[02:18:55.652 --> 02:19:05.496]  If you had deposited $100,000 in a bank at 1% in a 30-month period dating from May 24, 2005, here is what happened to your funds.
[02:19:05.917 --> 02:19:09.038]  The dollar lost 33% of its value in that time frame.
[02:19:09.298 --> 02:19:11.139]  The bank paid you 1%.
[02:19:11.199 --> 02:19:14.220]  Your $100,000 now has a net purchasing power of $68,000.
[02:19:14.760 --> 02:19:17.001]  Here is reality.
[02:19:17.362 --> 02:19:20.943]  The devaluation of currency equals real inflation.
[02:19:21.423 --> 02:19:25.045]  Keep in mind how the value of your paper assets are measured in dollars.
[02:19:25.632 --> 02:19:26.432]  We're good to go.
[02:19:26.453 --> 02:19:26.733]  I think?
[02:20:00.575 --> 02:20:01.115]  We're good to go.
[02:20:23.746 --> 02:20:24.846]  To the Nationalist Times.
[02:20:25.006 --> 02:20:26.487]  Just $19 for one year.
[02:20:26.627 --> 02:20:28.307]  That's 50% off the regular price.

[02:20:40.611 --> 02:20:45.373]  Or subscribe online at our website, www.anu.org.
[02:20:45.393 --> 02:20:46.433]  Hi, Mary.
[02:20:46.613 --> 02:20:47.613]  Good morning, Tom.
[02:20:47.874 --> 02:20:48.894]  Oh, you don't look well.
[02:20:49.154 --> 02:20:50.694]  I took your advice about the spoonful of sugar.
[02:20:50.714 --> 02:20:52.235]  It didn't give me the energy you said it would.
[02:20:52.517 --> 02:20:54.098]  Spoonful of sugar, right.
[02:20:54.318 --> 02:20:55.679]  That's an embarrassing pastime.
[02:20:55.899 --> 02:20:57.120]  I'm a changed woman, Tom.
[02:20:57.401 --> 02:21:00.443]  I found the products at OPCpure.com to be exceptional.
[02:21:00.663 --> 02:21:05.606]  They're all-natural, energy-giving supplements, restore your body's health, and keeps you going without groggy side effects.
[02:21:05.927 --> 02:21:07.688]  Spoonful of OPCpure.com, huh?
[02:21:07.888 --> 02:21:09.089]  Oh, I love the sound of that.
[02:21:09.329 --> 02:21:12.511]  Just a spoonful of OPCpure.com helps the energy go up.
[02:21:12.872 --> 02:21:14.853]  Pure, unadulterated, raw energy.
[02:21:15.033 --> 02:21:15.514]  Go for it.
[02:21:16.714 --> 02:21:19.176]  Are your Federal Reserve notes looking for a safe haven?
[02:21:19.657 --> 02:21:21.478]  Mine found it in precious metals.
[02:21:22.253 --> 02:21:25.437]  Not paper promises, but actual gold in my possession.
[02:21:26.077 --> 02:21:32.565]  It is liquid, it is private, it owes no one, it cannot go bankrupt, and it maintains its purchasing power.
[02:21:33.325 --> 02:21:35.528]  Find your answer at Midas Resources.
[02:21:35.908 --> 02:21:36.149]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:21:36.169 --> 02:21:36.629]  The answer is at 1-800-686-2237.
[02:21:46.579 --> 02:21:49.361]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[02:21:49.881 --> 02:21:53.223]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:21:58.607 --> 02:22:15.958]  I was talking to one of my people here during the break, and he said, Glenn Beck last night, and he has that show on CNN Headline News now, and I've heard him, horrible neocon, acts like he's nonpartisan, big liar, total piece of filth, acting like a conservative, and oh, he says, I don't believe in conspiracy theories, folks, but...
[02:22:16.607 --> 02:22:18.789]  But when it's staring you right in the face, you can't deny it.
[02:22:18.849 --> 02:22:22.711]  The American Union, why, rough times for America ahead.
[02:22:23.472 --> 02:22:24.973]  But see, that's what happens.
[02:22:25.193 --> 02:22:26.314]  We force the issue.
[02:22:26.354 --> 02:22:28.035]  For over a decade, we expose it.
[02:22:28.535 --> 02:22:29.136]  We fight it.
[02:22:29.256 --> 02:22:30.256]  We put the word out.
[02:22:30.757 --> 02:22:34.459]  Somebody like Lou Dobbs, who has some courage, who has his own contract, I've looked into it.
[02:22:34.780 --> 02:22:36.401]  He left CNN, by the way, because he didn't have control.
[02:22:36.441 --> 02:22:37.702]  He came back when he had control.
[02:22:38.302 --> 02:22:39.163]  He's able to talk.
[02:22:39.243 --> 02:22:40.223]  He gets top ratings.
[02:22:40.784 --> 02:22:42.545]  Other people then see that.
[02:22:43.866 --> 02:22:45.406]  And some of these neocons, that's what they'll do.
[02:22:45.426 --> 02:22:46.727]  They'll mix a little bit of it in.
[02:22:46.767 --> 02:22:47.947]  I'm not saying Dobbs is one of them.
[02:22:48.227 --> 02:22:49.067]  Certainly Beck is.
[02:22:49.388 --> 02:22:53.149]  They'll mix a little bit of it in because they know their listeners, their viewers are demanding it.
[02:22:53.169 --> 02:22:55.429]  Going, hey man, because I've heard Beck poo-poo it in the past.
[02:22:55.909 --> 02:22:57.430]  Hey man, you better cover this.
[02:22:57.490 --> 02:22:58.210]  This is real.
[02:22:58.490 --> 02:22:59.870]  Hey, Bush is for amnesty.
[02:22:59.890 --> 02:23:01.291]  Hey, this is an American Union.
[02:23:01.651 --> 02:23:03.191]  Hey, they really are anti-gun.
[02:23:04.112 --> 02:23:07.132]  I mean, I've heard Hannity before sit there and admit, we've got to do something about the border.
[02:23:07.172 --> 02:23:07.973]  It's a real crisis.
[02:23:08.393 --> 02:23:10.033]  We've got to get Bush's plan passed.
[02:23:10.113 --> 02:23:10.833]  That'll fix it.
[02:23:11.134 --> 02:23:12.454]  And it's a total amnesty.
[02:23:14.947 --> 02:23:23.789]  Now, almost every day I'm told, and I tell people who actually hear it, Neil Bortz, one of the biggest talk show hosts in the country, he's a talented guy.
[02:23:23.849 --> 02:23:24.469]  I've met him before.
[02:23:24.489 --> 02:23:25.689]  He walked up and started cussing at me.
[02:23:25.709 --> 02:23:26.349]  I have it on video.
[02:23:26.369 --> 02:23:27.089]  I never put it out.
[02:23:27.729 --> 02:23:30.450]  At Ground Zero during the RNC in 2004.
[02:23:32.230 --> 02:23:32.770]  Big guy.
[02:23:35.711 --> 02:23:39.532]  He says, make you take a big fat bite out of an Alex Jones sandwich.
[02:23:40.052 --> 02:23:40.852]  You know what that's saying.
[02:23:41.607 --> 02:23:41.967]  We're good to go.
[02:24:03.440 --> 02:24:05.721]  These idiots are getting their battle plans, their orders.
[02:24:05.741 --> 02:24:06.222]  They don't know.
[02:24:06.262 --> 02:24:08.443]  It only makes more people come here.
[02:24:09.003 --> 02:24:11.124]  People can tell in research this is legitimate.
[02:24:11.664 --> 02:24:12.725]  This is the real deal here.
[02:24:12.745 --> 02:24:15.526]  Saying Alex Jones covers up this and that.
[02:24:15.626 --> 02:24:17.267]  Alex Jones won't say it's the Pope.
[02:24:17.787 --> 02:24:19.448]  Alex Jones won't say it's the blacks.
[02:24:19.548 --> 02:24:21.149]  Alex Jones won't say it's the Jews.
[02:24:21.709 --> 02:24:23.270]  You see, because we have a big tent approach.
[02:24:23.290 --> 02:24:24.410]  We're fighting evil.
[02:24:24.771 --> 02:24:26.291]  We're fighting the New World Order.
[02:24:28.152 --> 02:24:31.794]  We're trying to get everybody together to fight this system.
[02:24:32.722 --> 02:24:36.323]  We know it's evil people in control of almost every major organization and group.
[02:24:36.923 --> 02:24:38.043]  It isn't one group.
[02:24:38.604 --> 02:24:46.226]  It's about getting on the show and talking about transponder toll roads, American Union, open borders, what's happening with the Second Amendment, the land grabbing.
[02:24:46.266 --> 02:24:50.827]  It's about exposing the evil, showing the government to be evil, to reverse it.
[02:24:51.460 --> 02:25:04.154]  It's not about just saying the word Catholic, Catholic, Jew, Jew, black, black, Mexican, Mexican, over and over again, Zionist, Zionist, Zionist, Zionist, Zionist, like that does something to the Zionist.
[02:25:05.968 --> 02:25:15.736]  Off on that subject, I mean, I have Zionist documents that are public where they say, going back 80 years ago, 75 years ago, supporting Hitler when he was a fledgling, oh, we love anti-Semitism.
[02:25:15.756 --> 02:25:19.479]  That then makes the Jews all run under our banner, and so they can be under our control.
[02:25:19.499 --> 02:25:20.800]  They go out and finance it.
[02:25:21.000 --> 02:25:22.021]  They go out and create it.
[02:25:22.601 --> 02:25:29.604]  So when I see myself being attacked from the bottom, the middle, and the top, and both sides, I say, Hallelujah!
[02:25:29.684 --> 02:25:30.765]  Thank you, God!
[02:25:31.265 --> 02:25:33.066]  That means we are over the target.
[02:25:33.086 --> 02:25:34.887]  We are taking incredible flak.
[02:25:35.427 --> 02:25:36.567]  It is intensifying.
[02:25:36.728 --> 02:25:41.990]  We've got people online and on websites calling for violence against me, calling for violence against people in the government.
[02:25:42.510 --> 02:25:46.473]  You know they're feds immediately when they're not arrested.
[02:25:46.553 --> 02:25:47.113]  You know.
[02:25:47.233 --> 02:25:53.457]  I mean, an average real person shoots their mouth off about violence about some talk show host or violence about some politician.
[02:25:53.497 --> 02:25:54.338]  They get arrested.
[02:25:54.718 --> 02:25:55.919]  Boy, it's a big news item.
[02:25:55.959 --> 02:25:59.101]  You can tell a fed... You know what?
[02:26:01.743 --> 02:26:07.807]  I know there are some of you out there who are young or whatever or haven't researched this who get fooled by it at first, but I know over time you'll wake up to it.
[02:26:09.349 --> 02:26:11.391]  And so people say, well, you need to respond to this.
[02:26:11.411 --> 02:26:15.754]  You need to respond to the fact that you're anti-Semitic.
[02:26:15.834 --> 02:26:16.815]  No, I'm not going to respond to that.
[02:26:16.855 --> 02:26:17.415]  It's not true.
[02:26:17.795 --> 02:26:18.756]  Who I am shows I'm not.
[02:26:19.036 --> 02:26:23.400]  You need to respond to the fact that you're a Mossad agent and you're really Jewish.
[02:26:23.460 --> 02:26:25.981]  And I go, well, I'm not Jewish, but so what if I was?
[02:26:26.001 --> 02:26:29.064]  Well, we're not anti-Semites, but you're really a Jew.
[02:26:30.345 --> 02:26:32.166]  Well, if I was a Jew, what would be wrong with it?
[02:26:32.186 --> 02:26:35.208]  I'm not Jewish, but so what if I was?
[02:26:35.228 --> 02:26:37.150]  What's wrong with that?
[02:26:37.190 --> 02:26:38.631]  You see, none of it washes.
[02:26:39.492 --> 02:26:39.873]  None of it.
[02:26:39.953 --> 02:26:41.334]  It's all lies.
[02:26:41.474 --> 02:26:42.095]  And I see it.
[02:26:42.555 --> 02:26:44.057]  It's lies when Bortz attacks me.
[02:26:44.257 --> 02:26:45.719]  It's misrepresentation of straw men.
[02:26:46.039 --> 02:26:47.521]  It's lies when Hannity attacks.
[02:26:48.001 --> 02:26:50.904]  It's lies when other talk show hosts attack me.
[02:26:50.944 --> 02:26:52.886]  It's lies when the New York Times attacks.
[02:26:52.926 --> 02:26:54.468]  It's lies when Vanity Fair attacks.
[02:26:54.508 --> 02:26:55.189]  It's lies.
[02:26:55.669 --> 02:26:56.791]  And people know that.
[02:26:56.911 --> 02:26:58.212]  People see right through it.
[02:26:58.512 --> 02:27:00.795]  So the feds have tried to shift it to the web.
[02:27:01.824 --> 02:27:04.905]  And to people posing as patriots, people see right through that.
[02:27:05.005 --> 02:27:08.387]  And again, these idiot feds are attacking me, sending me listeners.
[02:27:08.747 --> 02:27:10.788]  The listenership on the web is exploding.
[02:27:10.828 --> 02:27:12.108]  On AM and FM is exploding.
[02:27:13.009 --> 02:27:14.189]  Everything is exploding.
[02:27:14.229 --> 02:27:16.590]  We're growing by leaps and bounds.
[02:27:16.650 --> 02:27:20.392]  As the Bible says, the enemy's attacks against you will actually be a blessing.
[02:27:21.084 --> 02:27:21.945]  It's a blessing.
[02:27:22.305 --> 02:27:24.427]  And they're so evil, they're not going to stop.
[02:27:24.827 --> 02:27:28.029]  I can sit here and tell them everything they're doing is empowering us.
[02:27:28.489 --> 02:27:30.891]  They still cannot control themselves.
[02:27:31.131 --> 02:27:31.792]  We'll be right back.
[02:27:31.812 --> 02:27:32.793]  So keep attacking, Borts.
[02:27:36.175 --> 02:27:37.076]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.556 --> 02:27:39.157]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.177 --> 02:27:42.780]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.539 --> 02:27:48.881]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here with an important question.
[02:27:49.121 --> 02:27:51.163]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[02:27:51.303 --> 02:27:58.368]  I mean real hard to find all natural pure soap that contains no dyes, perfumes, deodorants, detergents, or other dangerous toxins.
[02:27:58.628 --> 02:28:07.215]  The Calbin Pure Soap Company, for the past 57 years, has been making triple concentrated pure soaps exclusively for healthcare professionals and hospitals.
[02:28:07.535 --> 02:28:12.220]  Now for the first time, Calbin Pure Soap is available factory direct to you and your family.
[02:28:12.360 --> 02:28:16.404]  That's great news because Calbin Pure Soap is made from all natural ingredients.
[02:28:16.605 --> 02:28:19.047]  It's earth-friendly and completely environmentally safe.
[02:28:19.207 --> 02:28:23.572]  So if you want yesterday's values today for good old-fashioned pure soap, call 1-800-340-7091.
[02:28:26.955 --> 02:28:30.498]  Save up to 85% off supermarket and retail store prices.
[02:28:30.678 --> 02:28:33.139]  Call today for a Calbin Soap catalog at 1-800-340-7091.
[02:28:33.159 --> 02:28:34.620]  That's 1-800-340-7091 or on the web at calbinpuresoap.com.
[02:28:34.640 --> 02:28:36.902]  Try Pure Soap once and I'll guarantee you'll never use anything else.
[02:28:45.879 --> 02:28:54.143]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[02:28:54.383 --> 02:28:58.745]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[02:28:59.045 --> 02:29:07.949]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[02:29:08.169 --> 02:29:11.791]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[02:29:12.071 --> 02:29:17.094]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[02:29:17.395 --> 02:29:24.139]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[02:29:24.619 --> 02:29:25.160]  What about you?
[02:29:25.745 --> 02:29:26.286]  Call now to order at 1-888-803-4438.
[02:29:26.306 --> 02:29:27.848]  Order today and save $14 by calling 1-888-803-4438.
[02:29:45.603 --> 02:29:49.671]  People who use Cardivite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[02:29:49.872 --> 02:29:53.279]  For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself time-tested.
[02:29:53.459 --> 02:29:56.866]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite.
[02:29:57.190 --> 02:30:00.432]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[02:30:00.452 --> 02:30:05.916]  This basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the diseases that we see.
[02:30:05.956 --> 02:30:15.603]  When we do our program, you know, herbal formulas like Cardavite, and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill now going for a regular job a few months later, we know we're doing something right.
[02:30:15.723 --> 02:30:17.024]  It's a well-thought-out formula.
[02:30:17.044 --> 02:30:22.508]  I mean, the idea of it working on yeast and metals both at the same time and liver function is dead on.
[02:30:22.988 --> 02:30:27.451]  You'll find, I think, that it'll work more than just on heart problems and circulation problems.
[02:30:27.511 --> 02:30:28.872]  It'll work on other problems as well.
[02:30:29.052 --> 02:30:32.875]  For more information, call 1-877-928-8822 or visit our website at www.heartdrop.com.
[02:30:32.975 --> 02:30:33.795]  That toll-free number again, 1-877-928-8822.
[02:30:59.344 --> 02:31:06.504]  We put out a report last week about 80 new NAFTA highways directly from their own documents, federal government.
[02:31:07.196 --> 02:31:08.837]  Hasn't been picked up by the mainstream news.
[02:31:08.857 --> 02:31:10.298]  Jerome Corsi's written another article.
[02:31:10.838 --> 02:31:13.119]  New World Disorders, the headline, World Net Daily.
[02:31:13.179 --> 02:31:16.201]  Docs reveal plan for Mexican trucks in the U.S.
[02:31:16.821 --> 02:31:20.963]  Internal emails allow public sentiment to just aim to expand quietly.
[02:31:21.003 --> 02:31:26.666]  And a lot of those are internal emails that Bob Dacey was able to get them to correspond back and forth with him.
[02:31:27.227 --> 02:31:29.348]  I mean, look, the stuff we're breaking here, it's incredible.
[02:31:29.388 --> 02:31:31.649]  Some stories I don't even care about we put out get huge attention.
[02:31:31.949 --> 02:31:35.551]  And when something we put out really important goes out there, sometimes it doesn't get picked up.
[02:31:36.593 --> 02:31:42.234]  So my crew is going to post this WorldNet Daily article, and in it we're going to post our other articles we've written.
[02:31:42.254 --> 02:31:45.915]  I hope we'll get them out to everybody, because people need to know the full magnitude of this.
[02:31:47.935 --> 02:31:49.396]  Something fun that means a lot to me.
[02:31:50.316 --> 02:31:53.277]  Jeff Dice is a really great guy at Ron Paul's office.
[02:31:53.497 --> 02:31:54.377]  Their whole crew is wonderful.
[02:31:54.417 --> 02:31:55.497]  I've met a lot of them over the years.
[02:31:55.537 --> 02:32:00.778]  I've been interviewing Ron Paul for now 12 years, before he even got back into Congress.
[02:32:00.818 --> 02:32:03.439]  He was in Congress in the 70s, then got back in in the 90s, late 90s.
[02:32:05.820 --> 02:32:10.884]  And we called up because the congressman's trying to get to his house to do the interview coming up here in a few minutes.
[02:32:11.665 --> 02:32:15.568]  And so we call the congressman's office, and he's back in the state.
[02:32:16.048 --> 02:32:20.852]  And we're going, yeah, we've got a guest on about 9-11, so we can wait whenever the congressman can do it.
[02:32:20.872 --> 02:32:22.133]  And they go, oh, yes, we know.
[02:32:22.533 --> 02:32:23.514]  We're listening right now.
[02:32:25.194 --> 02:32:30.756]  It's just great to have so many people listening to the show, so I'm going to give a shout-out to Ron Paul's office.
[02:32:30.796 --> 02:32:32.937]  I guess they're up back in Texas.
[02:32:33.237 --> 02:32:34.337]  Kevin, was that their D.C.
[02:32:34.397 --> 02:32:36.218]  office you were talking to?
[02:32:36.238 --> 02:32:42.420]  We're going to try him in just about four minutes and get the congressman here on with us as soon as he gets back to his hacienda.
[02:32:42.440 --> 02:32:47.862]  He just got back to town, and he's going to have a few days off with the family doctor, Ron Paul, Congressman Ron Paul.
[02:32:49.823 --> 02:32:51.183]  But I never really talk about this.
[02:32:51.203 --> 02:32:53.264]  That's why yesterday and today I talked a little bit about it.
[02:32:53.976 --> 02:32:58.938]  Because I've had people asking me about it who support us but go, well, shouldn't you respond to this?
[02:32:59.739 --> 02:33:08.803]  If I spent all day responding to detractors and people that attack me and responding to national publications that attack me, a lot of times I don't even do it.
[02:33:08.823 --> 02:33:12.965]  I mean, there's a lot of mainstream news articles you never hear about here because we just don't care.
[02:33:13.025 --> 02:33:14.846]  If it's about just Alex Jones, who cares?
[02:33:14.946 --> 02:33:20.708]  But as a teaching tool, as an example of how the globalists operate their propaganda, we can illustrate it.
[02:33:21.609 --> 02:33:22.289]  We can look at it.
[02:33:23.183 --> 02:33:26.947]  And I listen to so many other, quote, patriot talk shows, not the truth movement talk shows.
[02:33:26.967 --> 02:33:31.951]  That's what I prefer to be known as now, because that other name has been so sullied by maniacs, nuts, and government agents.
[02:33:32.592 --> 02:33:35.975]  When you hear their talk shows or their websites, all it is is attacking other people.
[02:33:36.555 --> 02:33:40.619]  Most of that is because they're egomaniacs who are just on a power trip and want it to all be about them.
[02:33:41.059 --> 02:33:43.521]  But a lot of them, it's a snowball or mockingbird effect.
[02:33:43.541 --> 02:33:45.123]  A snowball rolls down and gets bigger.
[02:33:45.463 --> 02:33:49.507]  A mockingbird hears other sounds and repeats it, parrots it, basically.
[02:33:50.433 --> 02:33:50.834]  Alex Jones Show!
[02:33:50.854 --> 02:33:51.474]  We're good to go.
[02:34:10.490 --> 02:34:11.691]  We're good to go.
[02:34:11.711 --> 02:34:12.312]  We're good to go.
[02:34:33.912 --> 02:34:34.973]  You see, people tune in.
[02:34:35.013 --> 02:34:35.834]  They know about that.
[02:34:35.894 --> 02:34:36.734]  They know it's a threat.
[02:34:36.935 --> 02:34:37.855]  They know it affects them.
[02:34:37.895 --> 02:34:38.816]  They want to learn about it.
[02:34:38.856 --> 02:34:39.697]  They want to get involved.
[02:34:39.717 --> 02:34:40.377]  They want to fight.
[02:34:43.140 --> 02:34:47.263]  And that's why it's great that all these people attack me, because then I just don't respond.
[02:34:47.303 --> 02:34:49.885]  They send me anybody they've got as listeners or viewers.
[02:34:50.786 --> 02:34:52.287]  We don't give them any response.
[02:34:52.407 --> 02:34:59.653]  We get the people they've tried to turn against us, and we just like judo, use their energy against them without ever even really responding.
[02:35:00.399 --> 02:35:03.940]  And then people come here and learn about the Global Crime Syndicate.
[02:35:04.140 --> 02:35:06.440]  They come here and they learn about the New World Order.
[02:35:07.621 --> 02:35:13.442]  So many people, too, that attack me will then admit, though, that I woke them up.
[02:35:13.922 --> 02:35:17.383]  See, those are the mentally ill ones or the stupid ones or the egomaniac ones.
[02:35:17.883 --> 02:35:22.064]  They'll admit, well, ten years ago or five years ago you woke me up, and now I've grown past it.
[02:35:22.699 --> 02:35:31.025]  You know, you won't talk about UFOs, and you won't talk about chubacabras and snake men, and I've grown past you and you're covering up the alien agenda.
[02:35:31.065 --> 02:35:32.146]  I mean, it runs the gamut.
[02:35:33.347 --> 02:35:45.516]  So see, what happens is we wake people up, then they go off and get lost or get nutty or get into some weird religious cult, or they're government agents, or they get compromised, or they're under the control of a government operative, and it's sad.
[02:35:45.536 --> 02:35:46.757]  I actually feel sorry for them.
[02:35:48.536 --> 02:35:51.417]  In a sick way, I'm actually encouraging them to attack more and send me more people.
[02:35:51.457 --> 02:35:52.557]  Oh, this is horrible what I'm doing.
[02:35:52.777 --> 02:35:57.959]  And see, again, I can even sit there and tell them that, and they're so stupid that they will continue.
[02:35:59.659 --> 02:36:01.880]  It's so sick, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:36:02.360 --> 02:36:05.321]  I just... I instinctively know how this stuff works.
[02:36:05.401 --> 02:36:13.564]  My whole life, I've been able to see scams and frauds and see things clearly for what they are to a better and better extent as the years go on.
[02:36:13.764 --> 02:36:13.864]  And...
[02:36:14.725 --> 02:36:15.246]  We're good to go.
[02:36:15.266 --> 02:36:15.546]  I think?
[02:36:34.440 --> 02:36:46.329]  But Castaway, New Jersey, where they're just openly going to steal $70-plus million worth of land, paying the people nothing, threatening to charge them money for the expense of taking it from them to then give it to local developers.
[02:36:46.510 --> 02:36:48.351]  And then they claim it's for environmental reasons.
[02:36:51.093 --> 02:36:58.279]  I mean, that's good old-fashioned 800-year Dark Ages Byzantine corruption.
[02:36:59.685 --> 02:37:02.627]  That's just in your face, what other example do you need?
[02:37:02.667 --> 02:37:06.611]  And it's every day, everywhere, at every level of society.
[02:37:07.611 --> 02:37:09.413]  Go ahead and try the congressman again, see if he's home yet.
[02:37:11.014 --> 02:37:13.616]  I mean, this is the reality of what we're facing.
[02:37:14.597 --> 02:37:15.978]  This is the new world order.
[02:37:16.819 --> 02:37:17.920]  This is what they're doing.
[02:37:17.960 --> 02:37:19.301]  They're eating out our substance.
[02:37:19.701 --> 02:37:21.823]  Read the Declaration of Independence.
[02:37:22.623 --> 02:37:27.047]  Read how it exposed the government for being corrupt and out of control and abusive.
[02:37:27.660 --> 02:37:36.505]  The list of particulars, the bill of particulars, the committees of correspondence, educating people about the crimes, cutting through the propaganda.
[02:37:36.585 --> 02:37:46.970]  We're doing that now, and the New World Order is doing most of the work for us, waking up people who were too dumb or too tired or too busy or too distracted to listen to us.
[02:37:47.411 --> 02:37:55.295]  The Iron Fist is crushing more and more of them, and then they're becoming the latest recruits to the ranks of free humanity against the globalists.
[02:37:58.075 --> 02:38:00.297]  And again, I am so blessed.
[02:38:00.457 --> 02:38:02.379]  God has blessed me so much in my work.
[02:38:02.479 --> 02:38:16.390]  It is so good to not be perfect, but to try my best to attempt to be genuine, to attempt to tell the truth, to attempt to do the best job we can, to attempt to do the best research, and to be 97, 98% accurate.
[02:38:17.631 --> 02:38:19.232]  It's just my life couldn't be better.
[02:38:19.272 --> 02:38:20.973]  I'm in the best place in the world.
[02:38:21.033 --> 02:38:21.754]  I'm so honored.
[02:38:21.774 --> 02:38:22.795]  Of course I'm in great danger.
[02:38:24.066 --> 02:38:28.708]  And of course, we know we've got rocky times ahead, but I am just so blessed to be who I am.
[02:38:29.048 --> 02:38:33.530]  You're so blessed that you've woken up to the New World Order, whether it was 25 years ago or last month or today.
[02:38:33.550 --> 02:38:44.294]  I mean, we're alive, we're awake, we're vibrant, we're on the good guys team, we're wearing the white hats, we're out there trying to warn and inform people, we're not buying into the decadence and the corruption.
[02:38:45.532 --> 02:38:46.573]  We're having victories.
[02:38:46.593 --> 02:38:49.515]  We're getting prominent people to wake up and come out and stand with us.
[02:38:49.815 --> 02:38:53.238]  And then the COINTELPRO people scream that, oh, look, that means they're agents.
[02:38:53.258 --> 02:38:55.220]  They're getting prominent people to go public.
[02:38:55.240 --> 02:38:56.601]  Yes, we're trying to win.
[02:38:56.641 --> 02:38:58.062]  We're trying to rally.
[02:38:58.102 --> 02:39:01.424]  We're trying to get people to go public and stand with us.
[02:39:01.825 --> 02:39:03.546]  We have to be ready to have victories.
[02:39:03.566 --> 02:39:05.668]  We have to accept that we can win.
[02:39:05.728 --> 02:39:07.149]  That's why we're doing this.
[02:39:07.369 --> 02:39:08.470]  It's what I've always said.
[02:39:08.530 --> 02:39:11.092]  We can win if we believe we can win.
[02:39:11.132 --> 02:39:12.593]  We can push this government back.
[02:39:15.623 --> 02:39:21.904]  As Congressman Ron Paul has said many times on this broadcast, when he's talking about the New World Order taking over, he says, you know, in their victory, they lose.
[02:39:21.924 --> 02:39:33.547]  And when they crash the economy to suck us dry, if we warn people beforehand of who's really behind it, the globalists can't pose as our saviors while they're raping us financially, economically, spiritually, nationally.
[02:39:35.227 --> 02:39:43.429]  So we're forcing the Glenn Becks, the Alex Joneses, the Ron Pauls, the Lou Dobbs of the world,
[02:39:44.809 --> 02:39:51.454]  You out there, the Sally Soccer Mom listening right now, Joe Sixpack, we're forcing them to cover real issues.
[02:39:51.494 --> 02:39:54.737]  We're forcing them to try to stay pertinent and stay in the game.
[02:39:55.433 --> 02:39:57.434]  To have to mention some of the real issues.
[02:39:57.935 --> 02:40:00.736]  All right, I twisted his arm to get him on here during his vacation.
[02:40:00.776 --> 02:40:01.557]  He just got home.
[02:40:02.037 --> 02:40:04.138]  Congressman Ron Paul, we've got you for 18 minutes.
[02:40:04.178 --> 02:40:04.979]  Thank you for coming on.
[02:40:05.339 --> 02:40:05.679]  Good.
[02:40:05.739 --> 02:40:06.820]  Good to be with you again.
[02:40:06.900 --> 02:40:08.240]  And don't call this a vacation.
[02:40:08.280 --> 02:40:09.841]  You know I do work when I'm in Texas.
[02:40:09.881 --> 02:40:12.183]  Sometimes they make me work harder here than in Washington.
[02:40:12.383 --> 02:40:15.325]  Actually, I know that you march and drive from rally to rally.
[02:40:15.385 --> 02:40:15.745]  I know that.
[02:40:15.785 --> 02:40:17.346]  You're the hardest working man in Congress.
[02:40:17.386 --> 02:40:21.168]  Yeah, we get around and try to talk to our people, trying to find out what they're thinking about.
[02:40:21.656 --> 02:40:25.177]  And you talk to a lot of people every day, so you know pretty much what the people are thinking.
[02:40:25.197 --> 02:40:26.278]  Well, you know what they're talking about.
[02:40:26.298 --> 02:40:27.678]  You've been talking about it for decades.
[02:40:27.738 --> 02:40:29.579]  The American Union is now being admitted.
[02:40:29.939 --> 02:40:31.339]  Secret deals now public.
[02:40:31.359 --> 02:40:33.160]  80-plus NAFTA highways.
[02:40:33.220 --> 02:40:34.680]  Congressman, give us your take on that.
[02:40:34.780 --> 02:40:38.241]  Yeah, and I see all of that connected to the two main issues.
[02:40:38.281 --> 02:40:45.704]  I've talked about our foreign policy, our stupid foreign policy, as well as our monetary policy, which helps to finance all this.
[02:40:46.477 --> 02:40:51.100]  I think the goal is one world government, and you've seen it coming, and you've warned about it.
[02:40:51.160 --> 02:41:05.130]  You know, we have not only the UN, we have the WTO, we have the IMF, the World Bank, and then we have all these subsidiaries like NAFTA and hemispheric governments, highways coming in.
[02:41:05.890 --> 02:41:09.192]  I just hope and pray that we can wake up people.
[02:41:09.552 --> 02:41:16.237]  There are some days when I'm at home I'm more encouraged than when I'm in Washington, you know, because people here in Texas in particular,
[02:41:16.761 --> 02:41:20.604]  Yeah, I think it's so well entrenched, and there are a lot of things that don't change easily, you know.
[02:41:46.457 --> 02:41:54.424]  I've always argued the constitutional foreign policy of non-intervention and staying out of the internal affairs of others to shift that gears.
[02:41:54.744 --> 02:41:58.187]  Boy, that is a major task to get people thinking differently.
[02:41:58.567 --> 02:42:00.829]  And the monetary issue, you know, to shift gears there.
[02:42:01.531 --> 02:42:05.654]  If you don't do it correctly, it can actually, in the short run, make things worse for us.
[02:42:05.674 --> 02:42:08.675]  In fact, let's get into the economic situation.
[02:42:08.756 --> 02:42:14.079]  What is, Ron Paul, you've had a great gauge in the past.
[02:42:14.139 --> 02:42:20.243]  Bernanke's saying he's going to print money even faster, a doubling of money supply in the next six years, maybe even sooner.
[02:42:20.623 --> 02:42:22.784]  What's happening with inflation they're trying to hide?
[02:42:22.824 --> 02:42:23.625]  What do you see happening?
[02:42:24.005 --> 02:42:25.626]  Well, I think it's going to get worse.
[02:42:25.966 --> 02:42:30.529]  The analogy I draw to what Bernanke is doing, he's tinkering a little bit with
[02:42:31.840 --> 02:42:40.669]  Raising interest rates, but they're still way below the inflation rate, so therefore it's a negative interest rate, and they're not achieving anything.
[02:42:40.989 --> 02:42:48.137]  It's sort of like a doctor treating an infection and giving a little bit of penicillin, and then the bacteria adapts to it,
[02:42:48.593 --> 02:42:55.835]  And it becomes immune and the medication doesn't do any good and you need more and longer and longer and eventually the medicine doesn't even work.
[02:42:56.035 --> 02:42:57.055]  It actually makes it worse, yeah.
[02:42:57.155 --> 02:43:13.320]  Yeah, and so what Bernanke is doing with his tinkering around and trying to save a system, I think he's just building a bigger problem, a bigger financial bubble and I think this dollar crisis is on the horizon and yet we still can't predict when that's going to happen.
[02:43:14.613 --> 02:43:17.994]  It comes when the foreigners get tired of taking our paper money.
[02:43:18.154 --> 02:43:26.217]  The Financial Times of London and other respected publications that I've noticed are good bellwethers are saying any time in the next year to two years we could see a total implosion of the dollar.
[02:43:27.038 --> 02:43:28.238]  I think that's possible.
[02:43:28.318 --> 02:43:34.380]  I wouldn't bet all my savings on it, but I'd certainly work to protect myself against it, assuming that's the case.
[02:43:34.881 --> 02:43:40.523]  But, of course, I've worried about this for many years, so I started buying things like gold and silver when gold was $35 an ounce.
[02:43:42.076 --> 02:43:46.160]  So even though there wasn't a total implosion, it wasn't too bad protection.
[02:43:46.180 --> 02:43:52.807]  They've devalued their money tremendously in those years, although it's not been catastrophic.
[02:43:53.243 --> 02:44:01.386]  The end stages of a paper currency usually is catastrophic if you just recall how the peso goes in Mexico and these other countries.
[02:44:01.486 --> 02:44:06.067]  It's a loss of confidence and they erase from the currency and then you have runaway inflation.
[02:44:06.347 --> 02:44:15.590]  Well, we've seen a 97% devaluation of the dollar in the last 106 years since 1900 and we've seen most of that devaluation in the last 10 years.
[02:44:16.370 --> 02:44:21.052]  Yes, but there's a significant change in the depreciation of the money from 1971
[02:44:22.737 --> 02:44:36.947]  Of course, when we got off the last bit of the gold standard that we have, but you're right, in the last 10, 15 years there's been a tremendous increase, so we're sort of on one of these escalating curves, and it's not likely to go down for a long time.
[02:44:37.147 --> 02:44:39.648]  Congressman, what do you think is most important right now?
[02:44:39.668 --> 02:44:41.790]  What are a few of the issues you want to impart to the listenership?
[02:44:42.750 --> 02:44:49.535]  Well, the ultimate goal is to preserve individual liberty, which means to restrain big government, so there's a lot of issue there.
[02:44:50.429 --> 02:45:01.516]  As far as issues go, I would say immigration is top of the list right now, protecting our borders, which is there's not a strong desire on our administration to do this.
[02:45:02.037 --> 02:45:14.445]  At the same time, we're designing a policy where we're draining this country of money and personnel by spreading ourselves around the world to where we have our troops and money and
[02:45:15.370 --> 02:45:20.332]  Everything overseas and building buildings overseas at the same time, neglecting our border security.
[02:45:21.353 --> 02:45:25.554]  I think that's the big one because that is also intertwined with our deficits.
[02:45:26.175 --> 02:45:30.276]  You know, they have these huge expenditures overseas.
[02:45:30.496 --> 02:45:38.039]  Today I had somebody in my office and they showed me what we're doing in Washington is that we're cutting things like cancer research.
[02:45:38.400 --> 02:45:44.402]  Now I happen to believe that under the Constitution, cancer research could be handled in a different way, but I have a great deal of sympathy
[02:45:45.006 --> 02:45:48.507]  Yeah, or building an embassy in Baghdad that's bigger than the Vatican.
[02:46:09.173 --> 02:46:12.175]  Let me shift gears to property because that is part of the economy.
[02:46:12.896 --> 02:46:20.261]  Going on in Piscataway, New Jersey, land valued publicly just at tax roll prices at over $70 million.
[02:46:21.161 --> 02:46:25.204]  The local city is stealing it and not even saying they're going to give any money to the family.
[02:46:25.464 --> 02:46:28.146]  And they admit that they're using environmental reasons to grab it.
[02:46:28.166 --> 02:46:28.926]  It's just a farm.
[02:46:29.207 --> 02:46:32.269]  And they're saying that they're going to give it to private developers.
[02:46:32.569 --> 02:46:35.991]  We're now seeing stuff even worse than New London, sir, on a weekly basis.
[02:46:39.533 --> 02:46:40.734]  Well, that's been steady.
[02:46:40.854 --> 02:46:53.360]  I don't think we really own our property, and I've been arguing that for several decades, because although we have title to it, we have liability and responsibilities to keep it going and pay a huge amount of taxes.
[02:46:53.400 --> 02:46:57.062]  But if we don't pay the tax and follow the regulations, we can't use our land.
[02:46:57.502 --> 02:47:02.425]  Just think how FEMA and Fish and Wildlife and OSHA and EPA...
[02:47:03.301 --> 02:47:07.743]  We have to get all these permits before we even can dig a ditch or drain our land or do anything.
[02:47:07.844 --> 02:47:19.950]  Exactly, but Congressman, my question is, from my perspective, things are getting into kind of a hyper-orgy of government stealing with corporations that aren't free market backing up, using government as their arm.
[02:47:19.990 --> 02:47:21.671]  I mean, you're in Washington.
[02:47:21.691 --> 02:47:28.034]  Is it just my perception, or would you say it's accurate that it seems like things are progressively, exponentially going wild?
[02:47:28.706 --> 02:47:32.429]  They are, and it's part of the military-industrial complex.
[02:47:32.509 --> 02:47:34.831]  It's part of the Halliburton control over government.
[02:47:35.252 --> 02:47:45.661]  Halliburton not only benefits from the military spending, but think about how Halliburton got those no-bid contracts for Katrina relief, you know, hurricane relief through FEMA.
[02:47:46.141 --> 02:47:50.285]  So, yes, I think that it is out of control.
[02:47:50.305 --> 02:47:52.707]  But the important thing is, is in...
[02:47:53.366 --> 02:47:58.347]  Arguing this case, the socialists all say, see what capitalism does to us.
[02:47:58.387 --> 02:47:59.547]  See this Halliburton.
[02:47:59.587 --> 02:48:05.028]  They're capitalists, which we have to refute because they are not true free market people at all.
[02:48:05.108 --> 02:48:10.809]  These are people who are in bed with the government and they're in cahoots with the government and they live off the government.
[02:48:11.229 --> 02:48:13.330]  And free markets don't work that way.
[02:48:13.370 --> 02:48:18.030]  Free markets put a lot of pressure on business people to provide a good service at the right price.
[02:48:18.070 --> 02:48:19.731]  That's what they're supposed to do.
[02:48:19.891 --> 02:48:21.091]  Well, it's fascism, isn't it?
[02:48:21.958 --> 02:48:30.402]  It's fascism when the government and big business gets together, and you know what happened in Europe 50 years or so ago when they did that.
[02:48:30.563 --> 02:48:36.486]  Fascism is very dangerous, and I think we have sort of a soft fascism.
[02:48:36.606 --> 02:48:41.008]  Usually people think of fascism with a strong militant... Stay there, Congressman.
[02:48:41.028 --> 02:48:41.508]  We've got a break.
[02:48:41.548 --> 02:48:42.849]  Final segment with you after this quick break.
[02:48:46.016 --> 02:48:47.496]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:48:47.696 --> 02:48:50.777]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[02:48:50.897 --> 02:48:54.778]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[02:48:54.838 --> 02:48:59.079]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[02:48:59.419 --> 02:49:03.200]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[02:49:03.340 --> 02:49:05.201]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[02:49:05.341 --> 02:49:08.662]  Riot police attacked people on the street indiscriminately.
[02:49:08.702 --> 02:49:09.782]  The medical bills...
[02:49:11.382 --> 02:49:13.423]  Are going to be enormous for me.
[02:49:13.563 --> 02:49:16.604]  You see them here with their hands cuffed behind their backs.
[02:49:16.784 --> 02:49:19.645]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[02:49:20.125 --> 02:49:26.247]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[02:49:26.527 --> 02:49:27.447]  Go to my website, InfoWars.com.
[02:49:46.061 --> 02:49:49.063]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.

[02:49:58.548 --> 02:50:03.250]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.

[02:50:10.819 --> 02:50:22.633]  It also removes foul taste and odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:50:23.073 --> 02:50:27.538]  The Berkey Light's rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.

[02:51:47.692 --> 02:51:49.674]  Final segment with Congressman Ron Paul.
[02:51:49.694 --> 02:51:51.235]  We appreciate him joining us today.
[02:51:51.255 --> 02:51:56.379]  You can link through to his congressional website and his Liberty Committee as well at Infowars.com right now.
[02:51:57.099 --> 02:51:58.060]  Congressman, you know...
[02:51:58.786 --> 02:52:02.768]  When Democrats are in, we see the evil of government with a Democratic face.
[02:52:02.788 --> 02:52:04.869]  When Republicans are in, oh, it's all the Republicans.
[02:52:05.389 --> 02:52:09.551]  I see it with each administration just getting progressively worse because the system itself is getting worse.
[02:52:10.231 --> 02:52:13.773]  President Bush has said he's above the law on over 750 issues.
[02:52:14.493 --> 02:52:18.795]  He's said he's above the law, and now I see locals saying they're above the law.
[02:52:19.556 --> 02:52:21.516]  The Fuhrer precept is now being picked up.
[02:52:21.536 --> 02:52:24.618]  Can you speak to this above-the-law business?
[02:52:25.706 --> 02:52:28.026]  Yeah, I think that is the basic problem.
[02:52:28.347 --> 02:52:30.147]  It's more than just one individual.
[02:52:30.167 --> 02:52:34.148]  It is pervasive, and it's the lack of respect for the rule of law.
[02:52:34.548 --> 02:52:41.329]  And the rule of law, as far as the federal government is concerned, is the Constitution and our oath of office.
[02:52:41.349 --> 02:52:43.310]  So I take that very seriously.
[02:52:43.790 --> 02:52:47.050]  But the members of Congress, you know, rationalized everything.
[02:52:47.090 --> 02:52:50.571]  They were taught throughout their public school education that the
[02:52:51.223 --> 02:52:59.548]  The Constitution is a living, flexible document that should adapt to modern times, and you shouldn't be held overly rigid to this rule of law.
[02:52:59.588 --> 02:53:04.191]  So Congress has generously ignored the Constitution.
[02:53:04.251 --> 02:53:09.094]  The President flaunts it, and the courts have ignored it, and they get in the business of legislating.
[02:53:09.634 --> 02:53:21.041]  So there's no respect for the rule of law, and they think that maybe on just one or two occasions they can do this, but all you have to do is once establish the principle that
[02:53:21.451 --> 02:53:26.614]  Because if you can reject one part of the Constitution without amending it, you can reject any part.
[02:53:27.294 --> 02:53:29.175]  Well, it's snowballing.
[02:53:29.255 --> 02:53:30.596]  It's snowballing.
[02:53:30.876 --> 02:53:31.777]  Now it's wholesale.
[02:53:31.837 --> 02:53:32.697]  It's routine.
[02:53:32.877 --> 02:53:38.660]  And the principle is well established now that you don't have to follow the Constitution.
[02:53:38.680 --> 02:53:47.545]  When the President signs all these bills and has these statements afterwards that, well, I have no intention of following it, he's in a way signing it,
[02:53:48.354 --> 02:53:49.235]  And vetoing.
[02:53:49.255 --> 02:53:51.357]  So in his mind, he's vetoing a lot of bills.
[02:53:51.437 --> 02:53:54.479]  In our mind, under the rule of law, he hasn't vetoed a thing.
[02:53:55.120 --> 02:53:58.803]  But he's going to decide what he's going to enforce and not enforce.
[02:53:59.303 --> 02:54:03.586]  What do you see happening with the impeachment of Bush coming up if the Democrats win control?
[02:54:03.606 --> 02:54:05.888]  Do you think they'll win the House and Senator, either one?
[02:54:05.928 --> 02:54:07.390]  What do you see happening in the next six months?
[02:54:08.070 --> 02:54:09.731]  I'd be surprised if they win both.
[02:54:10.372 --> 02:54:12.374]  But they're probably going to win one body.
[02:54:12.434 --> 02:54:13.655]  And if they win the House...
[02:54:15.738 --> 02:54:25.844]  Right now, they do not say they would have an impeachment, but I think the way that place operates, I think they probably will make every effort.
[02:54:25.944 --> 02:54:33.949]  Now, if they win it by one vote, maybe not, but if they happen to have a 10 or 15 vote margin, it would be a political thing.
[02:54:33.989 --> 02:54:39.992]  They wouldn't be holier than thou, but I think it would be payback time.
[02:54:40.152 --> 02:54:43.014]  Does President Bush deserve to be impeached for the things he's done?
[02:54:44.147 --> 02:54:55.279]  Well, I would have trouble arguing that he has been a constitutional president, and once you violate the Constitution, can be proven to do that, I think these people should be removed from office.
[02:54:56.280 --> 02:55:00.364]  A bold statement from you, Congressman, but your views are wildly popular here in Texas.
[02:55:00.444 --> 02:55:04.468]  In fact, if you look at the polls nationally and the Constitution, what you're doing is popular.
[02:55:04.749 --> 02:55:06.831]  Why can't we get more members of Congress like yourself?
[02:55:08.407 --> 02:55:09.388]  I don't know why.
[02:55:09.408 --> 02:55:25.155]  I think the message is very powerful and I think when you defend free markets and you defend personal liberty and privacy and defend the Constitution and propose a foreign policy that was designed by the founders of this country,
[02:55:25.956 --> 02:55:31.158]  If you ask general questions of the American people, they say, yeah, that sounds really great.
[02:55:31.238 --> 02:55:32.278]  Last question, Congressman.
[02:55:32.298 --> 02:55:33.178]  We're out of time here.
[02:55:33.198 --> 02:55:34.239]  I appreciate you joining us.
[02:55:34.639 --> 02:55:37.280]  The Iran situation, what do you see happening there?
[02:55:37.800 --> 02:55:39.760]  And what do you see happening in Iraq?
[02:55:39.800 --> 02:55:40.601]  How long will we be there?
[02:55:41.481 --> 02:55:42.801]  Oh, Iraq endlessly.
[02:55:42.821 --> 02:55:44.262]  I don't see us coming home.
[02:55:44.382 --> 02:55:49.824]  I think that a lot more people are going to get killed on both sides, and it will come home probably when we go bankrupt.
[02:55:50.404 --> 02:55:54.245]  And I think the neocons still have a great deal of influence on the administration.
[02:55:54.850 --> 02:55:56.896]  So you think they're going into Iran?
[02:56:03.607 --> 02:56:07.609]  I don't think they'd do it the same way with Iraq because hopefully they learned a little bit.
[02:56:07.669 --> 02:56:09.750]  But I think they'll confront them and bomb.
[02:56:10.011 --> 02:56:12.772]  And then maybe grab some of the western areas?
[02:56:12.812 --> 02:56:13.853]  Yeah, something like that.
[02:56:13.933 --> 02:56:22.738]  But just enough to further endanger ourselves because that will be just more motivation to come after us as terrorists.
[02:56:22.778 --> 02:56:24.038]  Congressman, thank you for joining us.
[02:56:24.158 --> 02:56:24.899]  Okay, very good.
