[00:00:05.405 --> 00:00:06.046]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.706 --> 00:00:07.787]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.488 --> 00:00:09.629]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.649 --> 00:00:11.070]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:12.731]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.392 --> 00:00:17.055]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.575 --> 00:00:21.638]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:39.552 --> 00:00:40.752]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:40.832 --> 00:00:41.213]  Welcome.
[00:00:41.253 --> 00:00:46.595]  Thank you for joining us on this December 5, 2006 edition.
[00:00:46.635 --> 00:00:49.957]  We'll be here live for the next three hours.
[00:00:50.017 --> 00:01:00.923]  We have Mr. Steele, the former clandestine CIA case officer, who joined us a few weeks ago and made big headlines all over the web and even in some newspapers.
[00:01:01.443 --> 00:01:04.486]  His discussion of Google in bed with the CIA.
[00:01:05.046 --> 00:01:11.151]  He'll be joining us today to talk about a host of issues including more evidence of 9-11 being an inside job.
[00:01:12.092 --> 00:01:13.593]  It's coming up in the second hour.
[00:01:14.394 --> 00:01:30.807]  We will have open phones throughout the broadcast and we're going to get a little bit into one of the Seinfeld characters, as you all know, getting huge global attention for repeatedly calling a group of black people the N-word.
[00:01:32.043 --> 00:01:38.325]  And it stunk to high heaven from the first days, but I reserve judgment on it, though most of the listeners thought it was staged.
[00:01:38.725 --> 00:01:39.505]  I thought it was staged.
[00:01:40.005 --> 00:01:49.307]  Now we have massive evidence that I would say conclusively proves that it was a staged event.
[00:01:50.287 --> 00:01:51.828]  So we'll be talking about that.
[00:01:52.148 --> 00:01:54.368]  Also, I want to comment on NASA.
[00:01:54.908 --> 00:01:56.329]  Wants to have a moon base by 2020.
[00:01:56.689 --> 00:02:01.450]  The word I've got is there's been all sorts of secret missions to the moon.
[00:02:02.395 --> 00:02:08.757]  A lot of the stuff people see that they think are little green men's craft are really clandestine operations.
[00:02:09.738 --> 00:02:11.898]  But very interesting.
[00:02:12.098 --> 00:02:21.382]  We'll even ask Robert Steele about that, a former high-level clandestine case officer with the Central Intelligence Agency, coming up later.
[00:02:22.422 --> 00:02:28.324]  When I walked into the office this morning, I saw George Bush Sr., Herbert Walker, breaking down and crying.
[00:02:28.344 --> 00:02:30.545]  Well, with the audio down on the television,
[00:02:31.539 --> 00:02:36.863]  We just record channels basically 16, 18 hours a day while we're here.
[00:02:36.883 --> 00:02:39.966]  I saw this demonic face he was making.
[00:02:39.986 --> 00:02:44.690]  He looked like he was... But then I turned the sound up and it was him breaking down.
[00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:47.032]  You gotta love it.
[00:02:47.472 --> 00:02:47.832]  What was it?
[00:02:47.852 --> 00:02:56.980]  About four years ago, Mommy Bush, the former first lady, said that anybody that criticizes her sons is dead.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.103]  And like flipped out, looked like a complete psychopath.
[00:03:02.074 --> 00:03:02.794]  on television.
[00:03:03.134 --> 00:03:07.076]  You know, these predators, it's kind of like a pack of wolves when they're ripping the guts out of a sheep.
[00:03:07.136 --> 00:03:12.637]  They don't feel anything for the sheep, but for their own pack.
[00:03:12.837 --> 00:03:15.718]  Oh, they love each other so much.
[00:03:15.738 --> 00:03:20.960]  It's just completely sick to watch these individuals
[00:03:22.674 --> 00:03:25.676]  I didn't spend enough time on this yesterday, but I will today.
[00:03:25.736 --> 00:03:28.698]  London stock trader urges a move to the Ameros.
[00:03:29.119 --> 00:03:31.600]  Many unaware of a plan to replace the dollar with North American currency.
[00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:32.701]  But he says, hey, what's the big deal?
[00:03:33.161 --> 00:03:34.562]  Let's go ahead and do it.
[00:03:35.143 --> 00:03:39.886]  And the headlines today and last night is pretty much unanimous.
[00:03:39.946 --> 00:03:41.227]  It's dollar rebounds.
[00:03:41.287 --> 00:03:42.328]  Dollar comes back.
[00:03:42.848 --> 00:03:43.989]  Dollar surges.
[00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:45.550]  I've got a bunch of stories here.
[00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:46.971]  One of them is out of Reuters.
[00:03:47.011 --> 00:03:48.872]  Dollar rebounds from 20-month lows.
[00:03:49.613 --> 00:03:51.074]  And then you read that it went from
[00:03:52.232 --> 00:04:09.086]  1.3367 to 1.3667 and then it went back down by just a few percentage points of a point of a percent.
[00:04:09.106 --> 00:04:10.487]  I'll just read over these numbers later.
[00:04:11.428 --> 00:04:21.476]  But basically, it's like you fall down into a thousand foot deep pit and you climb back out two feet and they say you've gotten out of the pit.
[00:04:22.621 --> 00:04:27.982]  But if you look at the overall two-year, five-year, six-year trend, the dollar's going straight down.
[00:04:28.002 --> 00:04:33.223]  They constantly... I mean, I've said on the Sunday show I do now, and I said, watch!
[00:04:34.503 --> 00:04:44.805]  You know, it'll go up a few... just a few points, and they'll just run around hailing how it's back and everything's okay.
[00:04:45.665 --> 00:04:48.126]  The basic psychological warfare here is amazing.
[00:04:48.726 --> 00:04:50.246]  And there's a bunch of other news.
[00:04:51.238 --> 00:04:53.780]  From around the world and Iraq, we'll be covering, stay with us.
[00:05:01.465 --> 00:05:09.631]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:05:10.032 --> 00:05:17.637]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:05:18.365 --> 00:05:25.430]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:37.237]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:05:37.537 --> 00:05:41.060]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:43.441]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:05:43.781 --> 00:05:47.624]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:06:00.945 --> 00:06:01.706]  Terrorism!
[00:06:01.866 --> 00:06:02.606]  Terrorism!
[00:06:02.706 --> 00:06:08.791]  Chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallout, biological attack, anthrax, and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic!
[00:06:09.031 --> 00:06:10.633]  Alarming words for our time!
[00:06:10.873 --> 00:06:13.355]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[00:06:13.735 --> 00:06:28.306]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:06:28.346 --> 00:06:28.666]  government.
[00:06:28.847 --> 00:06:30.608]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[00:06:31.008 --> 00:06:36.933]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[00:06:37.053 --> 00:06:41.556]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video Sheltering in Place.

[00:07:01.164 --> 00:07:03.586]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network.
[00:07:04.086 --> 00:07:07.408]  Let's ask the question that the Bush regime hopes you will never ask.
[00:07:07.788 --> 00:07:10.730]  That is, is the USA already bankrupt?
[00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:17.374]  As the world's biggest debtor nation, we are borrowing in excess of 80% of the world's net savings.
[00:07:17.454 --> 00:07:21.857]  That's $2 billion per day to finance the biggest deficit in history.
[00:07:22.097 --> 00:07:26.459]  Our creditors are becoming increasingly concerned that the debt can never be repaid.
[00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:29.221]  Japan and China, two of the largest holders of U.S.
[00:07:29.241 --> 00:07:32.002]  debt, are looking to greatly reduce their exposure to dollars.
[00:07:32.483 --> 00:07:35.024]  In fact, China has privately hinted that a U.S.
[00:07:35.064 --> 00:07:39.306]  attack on Iran could result in China's dumping massive amounts of U.S.
[00:07:39.366 --> 00:07:40.207]  Treasury bonds.
[00:07:40.487 --> 00:07:45.111]  To find out more about this, call for a free report on the coming dollar collapse.
[00:07:45.291 --> 00:07:46.932]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.
[00:07:46.952 --> 00:07:48.494]  That's 1-888-XANADU or 1-888-XANADU and ask for George.
[00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:08.335]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:08.955 --> 00:08:11.998]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:25.728 --> 00:08:28.730]  Coming up, we're going to get into this new moon base idea.
[00:08:28.770 --> 00:08:30.212]  There's nothing new about it.
[00:08:30.232 --> 00:08:31.773]  They want to establish the base by
[00:08:33.072 --> 00:08:40.836]  2020 sounds like a long way off but really it's only 13 years away and some change.
[00:08:42.517 --> 00:08:45.398]  What?
[00:08:45.418 --> 00:08:47.439]  13 years and 20 something days.
[00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:52.582]  And well I'll comment on it when we cross that bridge.
[00:08:53.951 --> 00:08:58.333]  I also want to get into Kramer, the big headline up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:08:58.353 --> 00:08:59.534]  Let's now move down the page.
[00:09:00.054 --> 00:09:03.776]  Was Kramer Richard's racist rant staged?
[00:09:06.298 --> 00:09:10.460]  Seinfeld DVD sales soar as once forgotten actor becomes hot property.
[00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:18.824]  Was public tirade staged for profit and notoriety while simultaneously pleasing the hate crimes advocates?
[00:09:18.924 --> 00:09:19.725]  And there's no
[00:09:20.658 --> 00:09:21.398]  Doubt of it.
[00:09:21.438 --> 00:09:39.726]  We've now discovered that back in the eighties he staged another outburst with the famous Andy Kaufman on live television and the outburst had little comments about Jews in it, they screamed at each other, they threw things on each other, they screamed at the audience.
[00:09:39.986 --> 00:09:44.148]  It was another staged event very similar
[00:09:45.770 --> 00:09:50.672]  In fact, the mannerisms, the body language, all of it, to what we saw a couple weeks ago.
[00:09:50.692 --> 00:10:03.657]  Instead of talking about the dead in Iraq, instead of talking about the police state here at home, there's just been a big discussion about how there's all this horrible racism and we need to arrest people that talk like that.
[00:10:04.938 --> 00:10:06.098]  So we'll get into that report.
[00:10:06.478 --> 00:10:10.480]  Really, the coup de grâce here, the most important thing
[00:10:14.557 --> 00:10:34.324]  That we're seeing in the pieces of evidence that show us that this is staged, well there's a lot of pieces and it all goes together, is that Kramer, we'll just use his popular stage name, Mr. Richards,
[00:10:35.999 --> 00:10:40.361]  Coincided this with the DVD release that's been the biggest ever.
[00:10:40.721 --> 00:10:43.823]  This is season seven, bigger than all the other releases before it.
[00:10:44.183 --> 00:10:44.844]  Dwarfing them.
[00:10:46.584 --> 00:10:51.227]  More than tripling the sales compared to many of the other releases, doubling some of the others.
[00:10:52.027 --> 00:10:53.968]  But, so it dwarfs all of the releases.
[00:10:54.508 --> 00:11:03.153]  And of course, Jerry Seinfeld was scheduled weeks in advance to coincide just days after the story broke at its peak.
[00:11:03.897 --> 00:11:07.599]  To then be able to satellite in Mr. Richards, Mr. Kramer.
[00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:23.445]  But the key here is that now we see him go embrace Jesse Jackson, embrace these other leaders, say that he wants to be punished, he's very sorry, that nothing he did was illegal, or quote, civil.
[00:11:23.465 --> 00:11:25.486]  That means they can't really sue him for it.
[00:11:25.706 --> 00:11:28.547]  It would be frivolous and would fail on its face.
[00:11:29.288 --> 00:11:32.189]  Just looking at the basic case precedents that are there,
[00:11:33.274 --> 00:11:44.539]  So he himself comes up with the idea to enjoin himself in a contract with the four individuals he offended.
[00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:57.886]  This is all his idea, to then put himself under the power of a judge to adjudicate, and then he, quote, wants there to be a ruling of monetary substantive payment.
[00:12:00.539 --> 00:12:03.094]  Now, when I heard this on Fox Radio...
[00:12:05.351 --> 00:12:16.036]  Sunday night, and then when I heard it again on another news radio station yesterday, it was reported that he's going to court before a judge.
[00:12:16.116 --> 00:12:26.921]  Now, remember, the average person's talking on the cell phone, drinking coffee, thinking about, you know, how they want to play golf, or how to act cool, or, you know, how to act stylish, you know, in their own delusional world.
[00:12:27.621 --> 00:12:30.502]  Very self-centered, and that's where they want you, because then you're not outward-looking.
[00:12:30.842 --> 00:12:34.384]  And people in their mesmerized state just hear, court!
[00:12:35.385 --> 00:12:35.966]  They just hear.
[00:12:36.026 --> 00:12:37.687]  In fact, I was at the TV station last night.
[00:12:37.747 --> 00:12:38.728]  I do a show at Mondays.
[00:12:39.048 --> 00:12:43.872]  And there were dozens and dozens of people walking around up there because they have Monday orientation every week.
[00:12:43.892 --> 00:12:44.952]  So people come in up there.
[00:12:45.433 --> 00:12:48.375]  And I even heard somebody as I was walking going, did you hear about Kramer?
[00:12:48.655 --> 00:12:49.876]  He's in trouble in court!
[00:12:51.718 --> 00:12:54.700]  And I knew I would hear that in chat around the street.
[00:12:54.740 --> 00:12:55.561]  And sure enough, I heard it.
[00:12:55.601 --> 00:12:56.261]  Key indicator.
[00:12:56.501 --> 00:12:56.702]  See?
[00:12:57.642 --> 00:13:04.948]  I don't want to do my analysis and think, well, the public's so stupid that they're going to hear court.
[00:13:06.269 --> 00:13:08.795]  And then just believe it's now illegal to say the N-word.
[00:13:10.389 --> 00:13:12.570]  And I said, well, let me confirm that.
[00:13:12.610 --> 00:13:16.032]  You know, will I hear others say it or will I hear it on top of radio with the callers?
[00:13:16.592 --> 00:13:19.754]  Sure enough, I heard it last night in the halls.
[00:13:19.794 --> 00:13:31.460]  And there were probably, when I was there for the three hours I was there doing two different shows, I probably walked past and listened to about 20 different people in the hallways and coming in and out.
[00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:38.204]  And I, of course, people in America discuss, by and large, what the television tells them to, whatever the new fad is.
[00:13:39.475 --> 00:13:41.138]  And whether it's O.J.
[00:13:41.498 --> 00:13:53.595]  or the Aruba Girl or the death of Anna Nicole Smith's son, none of it matters a month after it's in the news, but it consumes all discussion and all talk.
[00:13:55.541 --> 00:14:23.176]  No discussion of how cell phones are frying our brains, major scientific medical studies, no discussion of fluoride in the water, no discussion of mercury in the flu shot brain-damaging you, no discussion of the North American Union signed, no discussion of the dollar plunging, no discussion of all-time debt at record highs, even higher than the peak of the Depression in late 1933, no discussion of any of that, just a discussion of Cramer.
[00:14:24.739 --> 00:14:40.809]  And so you notice that there was almost zero discussion of this on this broadcast, except a few callers saying they thought it was staged by me in the last two weeks, week and a half, two weeks, because I'm not going to talk about something until I've had time to look at it.
[00:14:40.909 --> 00:14:42.290]  And yes, your instincts were correct.
[00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:43.271]  My instincts were correct.
[00:14:43.591 --> 00:14:44.732]  It's not very hard.
[00:14:44.752 --> 00:14:46.473]  I wouldn't pat each other on the back here.
[00:14:46.493 --> 00:14:47.854]  This is pretty obvious.
[00:14:49.004 --> 00:14:57.467]  That this person who made, I was looking in the press, he was making like five million dollars per episode the last season, so who knows how much money he has.
[00:14:57.827 --> 00:15:00.087]  But still, he's a nobody now.
[00:15:01.708 --> 00:15:06.909]  Obviously, Jerry Seinfeld's out directing things and doing shows and very talented.
[00:15:06.949 --> 00:15:08.850]  And I would say, you know, Kramer's a funny guy, too.
[00:15:09.410 --> 00:15:10.550]  Mr. Richards is a funny guy.
[00:15:11.170 --> 00:15:13.111]  But the point is, his career has gone down the toilet.
[00:15:14.272 --> 00:15:34.751]  So to coincide with the DVD release, he pulls another Andy Kaufman event, and it went off like a charm, and people like Jesse Jackson, who care less about black people, and was there when Martin Luther King was killed, and went along with the official story, and looks like he's an inside man, not involved in the killing, but involved in being handled by the FBI, a lot of evidence.
[00:15:35.011 --> 00:15:40.056]  We know he's compromised all his mistresses, and other corruption they use to blackmail him, that's come out.
[00:15:41.627 --> 00:15:43.993]  He goes around shaking down corporate America.
[00:15:44.013 --> 00:15:45.857]  I mean, that's really all Jesse Jackson does.
[00:15:47.808 --> 00:15:55.313]  He isn't involved in real issues like exposing the government shipping in cocaine into black communities, or the Planned Parenthoods, the death mills set up in their communities.
[00:15:55.733 --> 00:15:56.714]  He's not really involved.
[00:15:56.954 --> 00:15:58.034]  Or I haven't heard Jesse Jackson.
[00:15:58.275 --> 00:16:05.039]  Boy, can you imagine the attention he'd get if he went to New York where they'd grab little black kids and test drugs on them and pesticides till they die?
[00:16:05.059 --> 00:16:07.700]  You're not going to hear a word out of Jesse Jackson on that.
[00:16:07.961 --> 00:16:15.025]  He'll go piggyback on some big case where some hoodlums, you know, pushed cops and got beat up at a football game.
[00:16:17.296 --> 00:16:19.518]  See, he knows which things to pick.
[00:16:19.598 --> 00:16:22.259]  Things where it isn't clear who's in the right or the wrong.
[00:16:22.279 --> 00:16:23.360]  He's something else.
[00:16:24.701 --> 00:16:28.784]  So they're all together, and this is right when the new hate crimes legislation is coming up.
[00:16:29.124 --> 00:16:34.767]  In January, they're introducing it and they're saying it's one of their first orders of business to restrict free speech in America.
[00:16:35.288 --> 00:16:39.210]  Police already all over the country are arresting people that they hear say the n-word.
[00:16:39.470 --> 00:16:40.771]  They think it's already illegal.
[00:16:42.132 --> 00:16:43.273]  In England, it is illegal.
[00:16:44.196 --> 00:17:08.609]  uh... to use that term or uh... other terms like a log uh... which is similar or or or or uh... copper things like that i mean who cares their words but see they they give special power to those it's okay to make a little black kid drink pesticide till they die that's alright just don't call him the n-word while you're doing it you see so they attach all this power to it
[00:17:10.769 --> 00:17:12.790]  I'll just go ahead and cover this now, and I'll get into the other news.
[00:17:12.970 --> 00:17:14.771]  I meant to get to it later, but I'm already talking about it.
[00:17:14.791 --> 00:17:15.491]  Let's just talk about it.
[00:17:16.412 --> 00:17:23.015]  In fact, I have a video clip up on presentplanet.com with this story.
[00:17:24.135 --> 00:17:25.336]  It's moved off the main page.
[00:17:25.356 --> 00:17:27.037]  You'll have to click on yesterday's news to get it.
[00:17:28.497 --> 00:17:31.919]  To make it easy, we'll post it up on the top of jonesreport.com in the next few minutes.
[00:17:34.079 --> 00:17:38.901]  Was Kramer Richard's racist rant staged by Paul Watson and Alex Jones?
[00:17:39.201 --> 00:17:42.702]  Seinfeld DVD sales soar as once forgotten actor becomes hot property.
[00:17:43.142 --> 00:17:49.344]  Was public tirade staged for profit and notoriety while simultaneously pleasing hate crimes advocates?
[00:17:49.424 --> 00:17:56.507]  And again, the final cherry on top that sealed it, well it was really a double dose.
[00:17:58.367 --> 00:18:02.869]  That he staged something like this before and it got press attention.
[00:18:04.404 --> 00:18:14.712]  And that he enjoined himself, total ADL folks, total, this is so obvious, enjoined himself to go into court so they could say he was in court.
[00:18:16.634 --> 00:18:20.156]  And see, by the time the news reports it as well, Kramer has agreed to go to court.
[00:18:21.277 --> 00:18:24.400]  And then I went and pulled up the actual story and it was, no, it was his idea.
[00:18:24.700 --> 00:18:25.560]  It isn't even a court.
[00:18:25.821 --> 00:18:29.644]  He just, again, it's like asking a judge to be at your private corporate signing.
[00:18:30.184 --> 00:18:32.886]  And then adjudicating and, you know, to have them
[00:18:34.753 --> 00:18:35.853]  Make the decision.
[00:18:38.554 --> 00:18:40.134]  But see, that's how this works.
[00:18:40.214 --> 00:18:46.376]  And so the average person now thinks that Mr. Richards, Michael Richards, is going to court.
[00:18:47.956 --> 00:18:49.257]  And it's the big story.
[00:18:49.577 --> 00:18:52.738]  And everybody's hearing, he's gotta go to court now!
[00:18:54.938 --> 00:18:57.419]  Oh, he's going to jail maybe!
[00:18:58.379 --> 00:19:01.100]  Man, the judge is gonna get him!
[00:19:03.692 --> 00:19:08.498]  And they're talking about videotaping it for an even bigger hoorah!
[00:19:08.738 --> 00:19:16.868]  Him in court, standing at the podium, groveling and apologizing to the people he said that to, who don't even have any idea what they're playing a part in.
[00:19:16.888 --> 00:19:18.409]  They just know they're about to get a bunch of money.
[00:19:19.250 --> 00:19:23.776]  And the American people are going to see this, and this un-American piece of filth
[00:19:24.745 --> 00:19:33.390]  Michael Richards is going to sit up there and get even richer off this and help his buddies in the government and Chertoff sit there and butcher our Bill of Rights.
[00:19:34.490 --> 00:19:40.834]  Oh, by the way, that's a segue here into... He's back!
[00:19:41.374 --> 00:19:46.837]  After less than a week, Newt Gingrich has given another speech saying we've got to restrict the First Amendment.
[00:19:46.857 --> 00:19:50.099]  As you can see, that is a big issue for the elite.
[00:19:50.666 --> 00:19:51.986]  And they're going to go for the free speech.
[00:19:52.026 --> 00:19:54.907]  They have to, because we're kicking their hind inch.
[00:19:55.527 --> 00:19:56.868]  You're not going to stop us, traders.
[00:19:57.448 --> 00:19:59.069]  You'll never stop the American people.
[00:20:01.209 --> 00:20:02.290]  Ted Anderson from Formidas.
[00:20:02.350 --> 00:20:03.250]  It's December 5th, 2006.
[00:20:03.290 --> 00:20:03.770]  Gold's at $646.70.
[00:20:03.810 --> 00:20:06.991]  And one-ounce gold coins can be purchased for $667.49, $337.47 for half, and $168.74 for quarter-ounce coins.
[00:20:07.031 --> 00:20:07.471]  That's $667.49, $337.47, and $168.74.
[00:20:20.715 --> 00:20:33.542]  On June 4th, 1963, an unknown presidential decree, Executive Order 11110, was signed with the authority to strip the Federal Reserve Bank of its power to lend money to the United States government and interest.
[00:20:33.682 --> 00:20:36.884]  With the stroke of a pen, Kennedy would have put the Fed out of business.
[00:20:36.964 --> 00:20:40.345]  The November assassination quieted the production of the new currency.
[00:20:40.425 --> 00:20:43.347]  However, the Executive Order still stands unrepealed.
[00:20:43.627 --> 00:20:46.471]  Minus has the Kennedy vs. Fed document.

[00:22:01.750 --> 00:22:04.271]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:22:04.892 --> 00:22:14.078]  Have you ever wondered what former President George Herbert Walker Bush meant in 1990 by saying the Desert Storm War was a good chance to start the New World Order?
[00:22:15.057 --> 00:22:21.861]  The New World Order would cause us to lose our freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution and also our national sovereignty.
[00:22:22.762 --> 00:22:24.223]  Is this what Americans want?
[00:22:24.423 --> 00:22:27.505]  To be merged into a communist-style one-world government?

[00:23:41.052 --> 00:23:42.313]  That's www.L-A-S-E-M-E-D-I-N-C.com.
[00:23:42.333 --> 00:23:44.734]  Mother, do you think they'll drop the bomb?
[00:24:15.157 --> 00:24:15.677]  Welcome back.
[00:24:16.738 --> 00:24:20.579]  Glad that you joined us today.
[00:24:21.899 --> 00:24:27.842]  Coming up, we got Robert Steele, former CIA clandestine case officer, joining us.
[00:24:28.082 --> 00:24:30.923]  And we finally got in touch with him.
[00:24:31.203 --> 00:24:35.084]  We tried to get in touch with him this weekend, had him on yesterday, but we did get in contact this morning.
[00:24:35.704 --> 00:24:37.245]  He's got the Muckraker Report.
[00:24:37.305 --> 00:24:38.205]  He's Ed Haas.
[00:24:38.245 --> 00:24:42.767]  He's done some really good reports in the past that we've been watching and researching.
[00:24:43.656 --> 00:24:50.943]  And he's not a Israel throttler, just to throttle Israel for the sake of beating them upside the head.
[00:24:51.824 --> 00:24:53.445]  And so that gives the story more credibility.
[00:24:53.465 --> 00:24:57.409]  And then he has the FBI agents copies of their cards.
[00:24:57.829 --> 00:24:59.411]  He's called the FBI agents.
[00:25:00.772 --> 00:25:04.916]  And I still look at this story with a jaundiced eye.
[00:25:04.956 --> 00:25:06.197]  I think he's good to report on.
[00:25:06.257 --> 00:25:07.058]  I think it's important.
[00:25:07.834 --> 00:25:13.399]  Still, you never know what the Feds are doing, or this is a honeypot, but we'll break that down with him.
[00:25:13.719 --> 00:25:16.442]  We're scheduling him into the third hour right now.
[00:25:16.462 --> 00:25:19.665]  Looks like we're going to have Ed Haas on.
[00:25:20.746 --> 00:25:22.187]  And what story am I talking about?
[00:25:22.227 --> 00:25:26.251]  Well, we posted it Sunday, right when it came out.
[00:25:27.131 --> 00:25:30.995]  Prior knowledge of 9-11 attacks overheard in Hebrew.
[00:25:33.121 --> 00:25:52.913]  In October 2000, approximately 11 months prior to September 11, 2001, a former Israeli Defense Force member and veteran of the Yom Kippur War, 73, was collecting English ivy cuttings at the Gomel Cemetery located at McShelan and 245 Mount Olive Avenue in Newark, New Jersey.
[00:25:53.594 --> 00:25:55.194]  The cemetery is a Jewish cemetery.
[00:25:55.895 --> 00:26:00.738]  And while he was there, he heard two men over the little wall that couldn't see him
[00:26:01.525 --> 00:26:07.790]  Talk about, well, when the towers get hit in September, then the Americans will understand what it's like to be under terror attack.
[00:26:08.891 --> 00:26:13.134]  And, aha, the Arabs are so stupid that they don't even know.
[00:26:13.214 --> 00:26:14.975]  Ha, ha, ha.
[00:26:15.656 --> 00:26:22.681]  And, again, I've been reading Ed's stories for a while, and he's done a lot of good reporting.
[00:26:25.071 --> 00:26:28.252]  But then I read on, and I went and looked at the cards.
[00:26:28.772 --> 00:26:34.774]  I called the numbers, and it was of course Sunday, but sure enough, it was FBI agents' offices.
[00:26:35.415 --> 00:26:40.276]  And he says he talked to them, and I believe him, and this is pretty big.
[00:26:40.816 --> 00:26:42.137]  And of course, more has developed.
[00:26:42.157 --> 00:26:50.159]  He's going to do a Freedom of Information Act request, because one FBI agent told him, and she's senior now, that she's not allowed to talk about it, that she'd get in trouble.
[00:26:50.780 --> 00:27:01.004]  And the FBI said we're not going to release that information because this American who fought in the Yom Kippur War, a Jewish American, he went to them.
[00:27:01.204 --> 00:27:03.264]  And so it's on record he did indeed go to them.
[00:27:03.284 --> 00:27:04.365]  He did indeed report this.
[00:27:05.425 --> 00:27:15.449]  Now, I want to be careful about this story because this doesn't mean that Israel itself carried out the attacks.
[00:27:17.549 --> 00:27:18.490]  But I want to be specific.
[00:27:18.710 --> 00:27:19.510]  I believe
[00:27:20.846 --> 00:27:22.227]  I'm not being lawyerly here.
[00:27:22.728 --> 00:27:30.434]  Everything we deal with is more complex than some two-dimensional picture.
[00:27:30.474 --> 00:27:46.026]  There were Arabs in Egypt who sold thousands and thousands, and they were sold in Europe, of World Trade Centers with planes flying into them.
[00:27:47.147 --> 00:27:48.668]  It was just all over the place.
[00:27:50.211 --> 00:27:51.612]  And I'm not saying Arabs did it either.
[00:27:51.652 --> 00:27:52.813]  That, absolutely not.
[00:27:52.853 --> 00:27:54.594]  There were no Arab nations involved.
[00:27:54.634 --> 00:28:09.322]  The Arabs had absolutely nothing to do with the attacks other than the fact that our government recruited Arab nationals, trained them in spy training, that's on record, and had them as decoys on board aircraft.
[00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:11.621]  We know they were U.S.
[00:28:11.661 --> 00:28:29.389]  government agents, in triplicate, from the heads of embassies, from mainstream news, from Associated Press, from the Dean of the Defense Language School, reporting he was forced to train them in spy training out in Monterey, to the Pensacola News Journal, the Pensacola Naval Air Station, to MSNBC and Newsweek.
[00:28:30.989 --> 00:28:32.070]  Now remember, Israel
[00:28:34.978 --> 00:28:38.980]  You've got to love, quote, the rumor that Jews were in the towers.
[00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:40.601]  Now, there were Jews in the towers.
[00:28:42.102 --> 00:28:43.643]  And there were Germans in the towers.
[00:28:43.743 --> 00:28:45.123]  There were black people in the towers.
[00:28:46.544 --> 00:28:57.809]  But the, quote, rumor is not a rumor that Odigo contacted thousands of employees that worked at their U.S.
[00:28:58.130 --> 00:29:02.772]  headquarters in one of the towers and told them
[00:29:04.457 --> 00:29:04.957]  What was it?
[00:29:05.337 --> 00:29:06.918]  Six or seven hours before.
[00:29:06.938 --> 00:29:07.778]  It was in Haraj.
[00:29:07.818 --> 00:29:08.698]  That's how we have this.
[00:29:08.838 --> 00:29:09.939]  And that's a Jewish newspaper.
[00:29:10.259 --> 00:29:10.679]  In Israel.
[00:29:11.559 --> 00:29:14.320]  To get out of the building or don't go to work today.
[00:29:15.460 --> 00:29:20.982]  And that was from their Tel Aviv headquarters right next door to Israeli intelligence.
[00:29:22.402 --> 00:29:23.303]  See, people talk.
[00:29:23.383 --> 00:29:25.843]  Folks always say, well, the government was involved in 9-11.
[00:29:25.863 --> 00:29:26.444]  People talk.
[00:29:26.484 --> 00:29:26.864]  We know.
[00:29:26.884 --> 00:29:34.166]  FBI agents went to jail for insider trading, but they weren't the big insider traders.
[00:29:35.607 --> 00:29:39.710]  See, FBI agents got word in New York, too, in the months before there was a bunch of insider trading.
[00:29:41.211 --> 00:29:42.071]  So everybody knew.
[00:29:42.091 --> 00:29:47.154]  I mean, the towers were half-empty that day for what they would normally, what capacity they'd be at at that time.
[00:29:47.754 --> 00:29:48.455]  Everybody knew.
[00:29:48.495 --> 00:29:49.676]  There's just more evidence of that.
[00:29:51.637 --> 00:29:52.537]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.018 --> 00:29:54.619]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.539 --> 00:29:58.221]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.906 --> 00:30:03.567]  Shelly, you look exhausted.
[00:30:03.647 --> 00:30:04.448]  What's wrong?
[00:30:04.468 --> 00:30:05.749]  I am so tired.
[00:30:05.809 --> 00:30:08.290]  I just get so hot at night and can't sleep.
[00:30:08.410 --> 00:30:09.491]  I have tried everything.
[00:30:09.571 --> 00:30:11.312]  All kinds of fans, sheets, pillows.
[00:30:11.472 --> 00:30:12.613]  You name it, I've tried it.
[00:30:12.753 --> 00:30:15.035]  My husband has always been a hot sleeper.
[00:30:15.195 --> 00:30:16.776]  He's never had a good night's sleep.
[00:30:16.996 --> 00:30:19.058]  Then we discovered something that really helped.
[00:30:19.158 --> 00:30:21.379]  It's called the BedFan Personal Cooling System.
[00:30:21.559 --> 00:30:22.080]  The what?
[00:30:22.360 --> 00:30:24.421]  The BedFan Personal Cooling System.
[00:30:24.561 --> 00:30:29.905]  It will keep you cool all night long and will work for everyone that sleeps hot, no matter what the reason.
[00:30:30.085 --> 00:30:31.546]  You can see it at BedFan.com.
[00:30:32.206 --> 00:30:33.327]  How well are you sleeping?
[00:30:33.547 --> 00:30:35.188]  Are you getting the rest your body needs?
[00:30:35.568 --> 00:30:39.890]  Sleep disorder centers across the country recommend that you must stay cool to get a good night's sleep.
[00:30:40.150 --> 00:30:43.451]  The BedFan will keep you cool and give you the restful sleep you deserve.

[00:30:48.294 --> 00:30:49.514]  Is your partner a hot sleeper?
[00:30:49.534 --> 00:30:52.756]  Or are you looking for the perfect gift for that person who has everything?
[00:30:53.016 --> 00:30:54.317]  The BedFan is the answer.

[00:31:00.655 --> 00:31:05.880]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:14.127]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[00:31:14.387 --> 00:31:21.433]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[00:31:22.374 --> 00:31:28.860]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[00:31:29.060 --> 00:31:34.144]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[00:31:34.264 --> 00:31:43.132]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[00:31:43.412 --> 00:31:46.695]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5.

[00:32:34.571 --> 00:32:34.971]  I think.
[00:33:04.048 --> 00:33:06.028]  Here come your masters of war.
[00:33:08.469 --> 00:33:10.449]  Here they build the big guns.
[00:33:12.830 --> 00:33:15.230]  Here they build the death planes.
[00:33:17.151 --> 00:33:19.091]  Here they build all the bombs.
[00:33:21.491 --> 00:33:23.892]  Here they hide behind walls.
[00:33:25.812 --> 00:33:27.713]  Here they hide behind desks.
[00:33:30.223 --> 00:33:39.886]  Alright, we're back live.
[00:33:39.946 --> 00:33:48.768]  We're not taking any calls right now because I need to get through most of the news now in this hour because we've got former clandestine CIA officer, case officer,
[00:33:49.551 --> 00:34:01.698]  Robert Steele, big expert on the surveillance technologies, the overall New World Order operations, 9-11 inside job, Google involved with the Central Intelligence Agency.
[00:34:01.958 --> 00:34:04.360]  We made big headlines about a month ago when he was on with us.
[00:34:05.861 --> 00:34:10.103]  Got picked up by newspapers in the discussion we had, so this should be a news maker as well.
[00:34:10.163 --> 00:34:11.684]  Very important information coming up.
[00:34:12.785 --> 00:34:16.627]  But then in the third hour, we do have Ed Haas coming on.
[00:34:18.851 --> 00:34:41.825]  Of course I'll be taken out of context by those in the government and those in the media claiming I'm attacking Israel right now for simply reporting on a Jewish American who has reported this to the FBI, who has provided their ID cards of the FBI agents and talked to them.
[00:34:43.639 --> 00:34:58.905]  And this is one more case example of people who heard about prior knowledge or others that were involved in it, who then tried to speak out, who then tried to get involved, and who were basically just told to shut up.
[00:35:01.246 --> 00:35:08.649]  Now when I say I don't believe Israel carried out the attacks, that does not mean that I believe Israel wasn't involved in the attacks.
[00:35:08.869 --> 00:35:10.070]  Anything this big
[00:35:12.308 --> 00:35:39.074]  If you look at MI6, you look at Mossad, you look at Shin Bet, you look at CIA, you look at other black op groups above those organizations, even mainstream books on the Interpol and the whole global surveillance system will tell you that there's double agents, triple agents, and that at the top of the Western world, it is one big intelligence agency.
[00:35:39.114 --> 00:35:40.474]  They do joint ops together,
[00:35:41.281 --> 00:35:46.345]  Every single day they collect joint intelligence, depending on which sector of it it is.
[00:35:50.748 --> 00:35:54.850]  So clearly, Israel was involved somehow in 9-11.
[00:35:57.012 --> 00:36:00.734]  And so people out there then claim that that's giving Israel a pass.
[00:36:01.115 --> 00:36:01.335]  No.
[00:36:02.393 --> 00:36:16.304]  That is attempting to limit the scope of the investigation and tailoring the evidence to what you want to believe, and that is that if there is a hurricane, Israel did it.
[00:36:17.025 --> 00:36:18.786]  Or if you get a brain tumor, Israel did it.
[00:36:19.387 --> 00:36:21.689]  Or if you slip on a banana peel, Israel did it.
[00:36:22.990 --> 00:36:31.657]  The people that put this stuff out never really write any analysis, never warn you about anything, never put out any real detailed reports, never give you full spectrum data.
[00:36:32.390 --> 00:36:44.078]  They just basically, it's kind of like in The Shining, where Jack Nicholson is typing, you know, red rum, red rum, over and over again on his typewriter.
[00:36:44.378 --> 00:36:54.185]  They really just have one sentence they say over and over again, and it does nothing to hurt the globalists.
[00:36:54.225 --> 00:37:01.490]  In fact, the Labor Zionists, who are a big part of the New World Order power structure, have said that they love anti-Semitism.
[00:37:02.890 --> 00:37:05.752]  I mean, these books they've written, these articles are public!
[00:37:06.092 --> 00:37:17.100]  Because it makes good Jews, which are the vast majority of Jews, just like the vast majority of Africans are good people, or the vast majority of the British.
[00:37:17.460 --> 00:37:21.443]  In fact, when I bash the British, I get emails going, how dare you, you yank!
[00:37:21.824 --> 00:37:23.064]  You know, you don't like the British!
[00:37:24.165 --> 00:37:24.525]  No!
[00:37:24.646 --> 00:37:27.428]  The main power structure is based there!
[00:37:28.728 --> 00:37:30.610]  I mean, that's who owns
[00:37:31.349 --> 00:37:34.631]  The majority of the stock in the oil companies and central banks.
[00:37:37.712 --> 00:37:39.573]  It's not the British people we're talking about.
[00:37:39.593 --> 00:37:46.797]  You know, when I say that Canada is a police state, sometimes I get an email from Canadians going, you know, I like your show, why are you bashing us?
[00:37:47.317 --> 00:37:49.098]  Why do you associate yourself with the government?
[00:37:49.239 --> 00:37:50.899]  Why do you associate yourself with the mafia?
[00:37:53.841 --> 00:37:55.542]  As I've always said, it's organized crime.
[00:37:55.602 --> 00:37:59.544]  It's crime networks that we're fighting here.
[00:38:00.467 --> 00:38:07.833]  You know, is it anti-Italian to attack the Italian Mafia, La Cosa Nostra?
[00:38:08.233 --> 00:38:08.454]  No!
[00:38:10.055 --> 00:38:16.380]  But if you start... People have even written books on Bugsy Siegel and the Jewish Mafia, have been attacked, and oh, that's anti-Semitism.
[00:38:17.321 --> 00:38:25.648]  No, that's a criminal network trying to wrap itself in the mantle of the Jewish faith and the Jewish people, who are good people,
[00:38:26.636 --> 00:38:34.760]  And you've used them long enough, just like you used 110,000 Jewish children, Israel, that you radiated in your experimentation from 1951 to 1961.
[00:38:38.914 --> 00:38:47.579]  And I've had mind-controlled Jews send me emails going, you know, I know that was in the Jewish papers over in Israel, the Israeli papers, but, you know, you still shouldn't really talk about it.
[00:38:47.599 --> 00:38:49.059]  You're just using that to bash Israel.
[00:38:49.379 --> 00:38:50.460]  Well, absolutely!
[00:38:50.920 --> 00:38:51.841]  I'm bashing Israel.
[00:38:51.861 --> 00:38:52.601]  That's wrong!
[00:38:53.161 --> 00:38:54.002]  I want that to stop.
[00:38:54.062 --> 00:38:55.863]  I'm bashing those in Israel that did that.
[00:38:56.263 --> 00:39:04.327]  And when you defend the murder of Jewish children, and the brain-damaging and the maiming of Jewish children, you are no different than Adolf Hitler.
[00:39:05.808 --> 00:39:07.809]  I don't care if your name's Kruger,
[00:39:08.627 --> 00:39:11.549]  Or if your name is Schmidt, I don't care if you're a Jew or a German.
[00:39:16.891 --> 00:39:25.576]  So, number one, for those that just want to attack Israel all day, and that's all you do, you don't warn people about biometrics, you don't warn people about open borders,
[00:39:26.207 --> 00:39:28.248]  You don't warn people about the North American Union.
[00:39:28.268 --> 00:39:29.928]  You don't warn people about the Federal Reserve.
[00:39:30.588 --> 00:39:53.436]  All you do is literally like a Hari Krishna member, but instead of saying, Hari, Hari, Hari Krishna, you say, Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew
[00:39:55.350 --> 00:39:57.632]  The Old Testament or a Christian Jew follows the New.
[00:39:59.694 --> 00:40:02.236]  Whether you are a Buddhist, it doesn't matter.
[00:40:02.316 --> 00:40:05.118]  I mean, are you against the New World Order?
[00:40:05.699 --> 00:40:06.820]  I mean, take India.
[00:40:06.900 --> 00:40:08.141]  Incredibly corrupt.
[00:40:08.201 --> 00:40:09.702]  Incredibly wicked government.
[00:40:10.643 --> 00:40:11.804]  For thousands of years.
[00:40:12.184 --> 00:40:14.006]  But I'm not attacking the people of India.
[00:40:14.046 --> 00:40:22.013]  So the globalists are very good at, instead of us fighting the elite, they try to get us to attack whole populations and whole
[00:40:25.274 --> 00:40:27.236]  Subsects of the human race.
[00:40:27.696 --> 00:40:29.257]  Whole sections of the human race.
[00:40:30.398 --> 00:40:33.501]  Whole derivations of the human race.
[00:40:34.422 --> 00:40:38.305]  You see, racism and those terms are meant to divide us against each other.
[00:40:38.946 --> 00:40:42.268]  They don't want us to get together and fight the criminal New World Order.
[00:40:42.589 --> 00:40:46.432]  They don't want us to go out to the criminal networks, the organized crime syndicates.
[00:40:49.466 --> 00:40:51.727]  And to call it organized crime, and to call it out.
[00:40:52.147 --> 00:40:58.008]  They want us to attack whole faiths, whole groups, whole races.
[00:40:58.888 --> 00:40:59.969]  Now, I preface that.
[00:41:01.769 --> 00:41:13.432]  Clearly, Israel had massive knowledge of 9-11 to the point of Odigo, the Instant Message Company,
[00:41:14.634 --> 00:41:19.715]  to warn its New York based employees to not go to work that day or if you're in the building, get out.
[00:41:20.635 --> 00:41:38.219]  And it shows that the management of Otago was not involved in the operation, in the conspiracy to commit the crime, or the CEO would have gone, yeah, we got a call here at the office telling our employees we got a tip to help them get out of the building.
[00:41:39.807 --> 00:41:48.934]  Because, you know, they're seven, eight hours ahead, so it was daytime over there in the middle of the work day, and they, uh... Well, actually, they reported in the early morning hours in Tel Aviv.
[00:41:48.954 --> 00:41:49.494]  They got the call.
[00:41:49.534 --> 00:41:51.416]  They made it in the middle of the night over to the U.S.
[00:41:52.697 --> 00:41:58.461]  Put it out on their instant message to their network of people in their company.
[00:41:58.541 --> 00:41:59.842]  Get out of the building.
[00:41:59.922 --> 00:42:01.123]  Do not go to the building.
[00:42:03.920 --> 00:42:08.262]  And so many people knew that the buildings were half empty.
[00:42:08.502 --> 00:42:11.703]  About half the number of people that would be in the buildings were there that day.
[00:42:13.743 --> 00:42:25.627]  Now that said, clearly you've got a group of zealots who will do whatever they're told, who will follow whatever order if it is in the quote, name of supporting Israel.
[00:42:25.647 --> 00:42:33.150]  So a prime candidate, a prime group of people with dual citizenship in the Pentagon,
[00:42:34.685 --> 00:42:47.487]  In the White House, in the apparatus of intelligence, certainly there is a large Israeli contingent involved in the 9-11 attacks.
[00:42:47.507 --> 00:42:49.988]  There is no getting around that.
[00:42:50.288 --> 00:42:51.488]  The truth is the truth.
[00:42:54.529 --> 00:42:57.809]  And the truth is British intelligence was teaming as well.
[00:42:59.249 --> 00:43:02.590]  Our intelligence apparatus was involved massively.
[00:43:03.937 --> 00:43:13.261]  And it's like if you've got three people robbing a bank, and the people that want to say it's just Israel, they go, how dare you, Alex, don't say three people robbed the bank.
[00:43:13.621 --> 00:43:14.501]  It was only one.
[00:43:14.541 --> 00:43:17.282]  And I go, but everybody reported three people.
[00:43:17.463 --> 00:43:20.764]  And it would take three people to do this and load all the money in the time they did it.
[00:43:20.824 --> 00:43:27.066]  No, no, no, you're saying this person we caught is innocent by saying others were involved.
[00:43:27.287 --> 00:43:28.267]  No, that's ridiculous.
[00:43:29.065 --> 00:43:30.826]  And that's why those people clearly are feds.
[00:43:31.527 --> 00:43:39.212]  They don't want us to have an effective strategy to reach out to everyone and to bring everybody together to expose the 9-11 attacks.
[00:43:39.252 --> 00:43:47.317]  They want to pigeonhole it with false information and say it was one small group who didn't have the capacity to make NORAD stand down.
[00:43:48.061 --> 00:43:52.265]  That didn't have the capacity to have these people trained at U.S.
[00:43:52.285 --> 00:43:53.165]  military bases.
[00:43:53.606 --> 00:43:58.150]  That didn't have the capacity to mass the 44,000 U.S.
[00:43:58.530 --> 00:44:01.733]  troops in the surrounding countries around Afghanistan.
[00:44:03.434 --> 00:44:07.718]  You know, the CIA insider trading leading right back to the CIA.
[00:44:09.079 --> 00:44:09.479]  Everything!
[00:44:09.519 --> 00:44:12.602]  No, this is a criminal group together!
[00:44:13.678 --> 00:44:40.127]  This is the highest levels of intelligence with corporate backers using drills to bootleg and fund the operations, CIA run drills through the Pentagon of the exact same targets at the exact same time being targeted, stand down orders signed by Cheney taking the shoot down powers away two and a half months plus before, I don't know, what's June 1st to September 11th?
[00:44:40.147 --> 00:44:40.907]  How many months is that?
[00:44:42.122 --> 00:44:44.364]  Taking the power from the generals to be able to shoot down.
[00:44:44.684 --> 00:44:48.647]  This was a well-orchestrated, concerted campaign.
[00:44:48.927 --> 00:44:53.170]  The NSA, again, blocks of it that weren't part of the program, part of the attack.
[00:44:53.491 --> 00:44:55.532]  They picked up the chatter of the coming attacks.
[00:44:56.313 --> 00:45:03.078]  Blocks of Israeli intelligence that weren't part of the small criminal groups that networked together to do it.
[00:45:03.358 --> 00:45:04.038]  They reported it.
[00:45:04.258 --> 00:45:05.279]  The Egyptians reported it.
[00:45:05.519 --> 00:45:06.360]  The British reported it.
[00:45:06.580 --> 00:45:07.361]  The French reported it.
[00:45:07.561 --> 00:45:08.421]  The Germans reported it.
[00:45:09.462 --> 00:45:10.383]  The Russians reported it.
[00:45:11.078 --> 00:45:18.261]  They all said Dr. Tania Kardashian, the chief economist for Putin, came out and said there was going to be an attack on America's financial center.
[00:45:20.362 --> 00:45:21.723]  She didn't say World Trade Centers.
[00:45:23.063 --> 00:45:26.265]  She said on America's financial center.
[00:45:27.074 --> 00:45:34.540]  And it will be run by the Deadhead Group, and that was an improper translation in the American papers out of the Russian.
[00:45:34.580 --> 00:45:40.685]  I went and had it looked at with a Russian dictionary, and you know what the Deadhead translates to?
[00:45:40.885 --> 00:45:41.906]  Skull and bones.
[00:45:44.308 --> 00:45:49.192]  I mean, she said that a few weeks after I launched Operation Expose the Government Terrorist.
[00:45:49.838 --> 00:45:52.579]  I mean, there was so much chatter about attacks on New York.
[00:45:52.899 --> 00:45:56.261]  The FBI had cooked the bomb, trained the driver.
[00:45:56.401 --> 00:45:57.421]  We know the names.
[00:45:57.861 --> 00:45:59.102]  We know who they hired to do it.
[00:45:59.122 --> 00:46:01.103]  It was even in the New York Times in 93.
[00:46:02.203 --> 00:46:05.404]  And right as the story broke, they launched the Waco siege to smokescreen that.
[00:46:07.405 --> 00:46:12.567]  Now, was Israel involved in the first World Trade Center attack?
[00:46:16.689 --> 00:46:16.949]  Yes.
[00:46:18.653 --> 00:46:19.934]  Did they run the attack?
[00:46:20.154 --> 00:46:22.435]  No, I'd say they were about 25% of the attack.
[00:46:22.875 --> 00:46:35.301]  And agents, Israeli Mossad agents, like our Homeland Security Director, think about how scary that is, Benjamin, I always say Benjamin, that was his family member running a hit piece on me, in Popular Mechanics.
[00:46:35.681 --> 00:46:42.284]  Michael Chertoff was involved, and an article has been written about this, in the cover-up of that.
[00:46:44.385 --> 00:46:44.986]  But the FBI,
[00:46:46.633 --> 00:46:54.539]  It was FBI agents, American agents with WASP names, who went and carried out the attack.
[00:46:54.819 --> 00:46:55.840]  Who went and cooked the bomb.
[00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:59.723]  Who hired the Egyptian security agent, Ahmad Salam, to do it.
[00:46:59.883 --> 00:47:01.544]  And Salam thought they were setting him up.
[00:47:01.784 --> 00:47:04.006]  She went and recorded him, going, well, I built the bomb.
[00:47:04.026 --> 00:47:04.966]  It wasn't supposed to be real.
[00:47:05.006 --> 00:47:06.808]  You told me to build it real when you gave me a detonator.
[00:47:07.048 --> 00:47:07.848]  We didn't need to do this.
[00:47:07.868 --> 00:47:08.869]  They don't know what a real bomb is.
[00:47:09.029 --> 00:47:09.810]  Let's go bust them.
[00:47:10.230 --> 00:47:11.791]  No, no, we're pulling you off the case.
[00:47:11.811 --> 00:47:12.772]  We're letting this go forward.
[00:47:15.783 --> 00:47:17.244]  Oklahoma City, who bombed that?
[00:47:17.304 --> 00:47:19.144]  We know that it was Arabs on the ground.
[00:47:19.684 --> 00:47:28.107]  But we know those Arabs were brought into the country by George Bush Senior, and then by Bill Clinton, he brought in another 2,000.
[00:47:28.508 --> 00:47:30.488]  Senior brought in 3,000.
[00:47:32.389 --> 00:47:34.390]  So see, this is cloak and dagger, folks.
[00:47:34.810 --> 00:47:37.351]  All the fingerprints of intelligence agencies are all over it.
[00:47:37.651 --> 00:47:39.712]  It's just like when they killed Kennedy.
[00:47:39.992 --> 00:47:40.932]  This is how they operate.
[00:47:41.505 --> 00:47:52.632]  They had Mafia hitmen there, they had Texas Dixie Mafia hitmen there, they had Army snipers there, they had CIA patsies there, like Oswald.
[00:47:55.333 --> 00:47:56.334]  This is what they do!
[00:47:58.235 --> 00:48:00.356]  And then people get confused and go, it was the Mafia!
[00:48:01.757 --> 00:48:02.858]  No, it was the Army!
[00:48:03.578 --> 00:48:04.639]  No, it was the Cubans!
[00:48:05.179 --> 00:48:08.081]  And then you look at the actual historical evidence, they were all there!
[00:48:08.781 --> 00:48:10.002]  And we have the widow,
[00:48:10.979 --> 00:48:31.684]  Excuse me, the mistress of LBJ on this show years ago, we have video of her up on presentplanet.tv, saying, you know, he came out of the meeting with the Rothschild representative, the Rockefeller representative, the Merchantsons were there, the Hunts were there, and he said, well, I'm going to kill that SOB.
[00:48:32.104 --> 00:48:35.665]  He's never going to embarrass me again tomorrow, after tomorrow.
[00:48:36.366 --> 00:48:38.006]  And then I've interviewed LBJ's lawyer.
[00:48:39.022 --> 00:48:41.583]  Barr McClelland, father of the former White House Press Secretary.
[00:48:42.023 --> 00:48:44.684]  Admittedly, LBJ's main lawyer for 15 years.
[00:48:45.064 --> 00:48:46.544]  Yeah, they said they killed him.
[00:48:47.544 --> 00:48:51.705]  But, I mean, that was LBJ bragging, taking credit for something he was just part of.
[00:48:53.106 --> 00:48:54.326]  No, he was just their front man.
[00:48:54.886 --> 00:48:59.428]  So, that's how the new war, and if you study intelligence operations, take World War II.
[00:48:59.968 --> 00:49:05.669]  You know, the CIA and its, and it was OSS then, and its invasion of Italy.
[00:49:07.290 --> 00:49:08.370]  First Greece and then Italy.
[00:49:10.049 --> 00:49:12.610]  If you look at that, they used the Mafia.
[00:49:12.650 --> 00:49:13.810]  They used the Greek Mafia.
[00:49:14.350 --> 00:49:16.691]  They used the Sicilian Mafia.
[00:49:16.751 --> 00:49:19.492]  They used the Mainland Mafia.
[00:49:19.732 --> 00:49:21.913]  When they went in, they used criminal networks.
[00:49:22.013 --> 00:49:25.214]  And this is membranes of separation.
[00:49:26.554 --> 00:49:27.754]  So they're all guilty.
[00:49:28.675 --> 00:49:30.175]  Clearly British Intelligence.
[00:49:30.375 --> 00:49:32.676]  Clearly CIA.
[00:49:33.296 --> 00:49:35.517]  Clearly private corporations in conjunction.
[00:49:35.577 --> 00:49:36.777]  And clearly Israel.
[00:49:39.860 --> 00:49:41.762]  And is that any surprise?
[00:49:41.802 --> 00:49:42.603]  Who are allies?
[00:49:42.623 --> 00:49:44.464]  The U.S., Israel, and England.
[00:49:45.024 --> 00:49:46.746]  It's a triumvirate.
[00:49:46.826 --> 00:49:48.888]  It's a triangle of power.
[00:49:48.948 --> 00:49:51.570]  It's a nexus point of power.
[00:49:52.230 --> 00:49:55.853]  It's criminals running our governments.
[00:49:58.435 --> 00:50:06.982]  And because the Feds don't care if you get one piece of the puzzle, but they don't like somebody who gives you the big picture.
[00:50:08.473 --> 00:50:12.936]  Full spectrum analysis of what we're facing.
[00:50:13.716 --> 00:50:19.399]  Now I think Ed Haas is a good reporter and I'm still not going to completely trust this story.
[00:50:19.419 --> 00:50:20.120]  We're going to vet it.
[00:50:20.260 --> 00:50:21.320]  He's vetting it himself.
[00:50:21.761 --> 00:50:23.142]  But we have the FBI agent's numbers.
[00:50:23.162 --> 00:50:23.962]  We have their cards.
[00:50:24.322 --> 00:50:33.067]  We have this witness that he's talked to who went to and eight months before the attacks reported this to the FBI and for months and months up until the attacks tried to get him to do something.
[00:50:33.347 --> 00:50:37.450]  And then we have all the other FBI agents who were compartmentalized and not part of the attacks in Phoenix
[00:50:38.320 --> 00:50:40.181]  In Chicago, in Minneapolis, St.
[00:50:40.221 --> 00:50:43.622]  Paul, in Dallas saying the same thing they knew and were told to back off.
[00:50:45.422 --> 00:50:45.782]  You see?
[00:50:46.663 --> 00:50:52.224]  This is part of a larger pattern of people that warned and knew being told to shut up.
[00:50:52.924 --> 00:50:54.105]  Are you seeing what's happening here?
[00:50:54.485 --> 00:50:56.986]  This is just one more piece of evidence, but we've got to vet it.
[00:50:57.386 --> 00:50:57.926]  We'll be right back.
[00:51:04.338 --> 00:51:04.798]  It's here!
[00:51:05.018 --> 00:51:09.761]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:51:10.161 --> 00:51:17.825]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:18.505 --> 00:51:25.548]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:51:25.949 --> 00:51:32.832]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying,
[00:51:33.314 --> 00:51:37.338]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:51:37.678 --> 00:51:41.201]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:51:41.661 --> 00:51:43.563]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:51:43.903 --> 00:51:47.827]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:52:01.129 --> 00:52:02.970]  Dad, can we stop?
[00:52:03.311 --> 00:52:04.832]  We need to go to the bathroom.
[00:52:05.252 --> 00:52:05.492]  What?
[00:52:05.853 --> 00:52:06.213]  Again?
[00:52:06.633 --> 00:52:08.254]  We just stopped two hours ago.
[00:52:08.334 --> 00:52:12.758]  Honey, let's stop because I gave the kids their Spark Berkey water bottles.
[00:52:12.998 --> 00:52:14.279]  Why did you do that?
[00:52:14.479 --> 00:52:20.283]  Because they can't drink and talk at the same time and that way we don't have to listen to them singing, Are we there yet?
[00:52:20.583 --> 00:52:21.604]  Are we there yet?
[00:52:21.724 --> 00:52:22.785]  for the entire trip.
[00:52:23.025 --> 00:52:25.227]  Hmm, I didn't think about that.
[00:52:25.707 --> 00:52:26.728]  Great idea.
[00:52:27.008 --> 00:52:29.530]  Yeah, and it's cheap entertainment for the kids.
[00:52:29.955 --> 00:52:32.421]  Bottled water costs around 75 cents a bottle.
[00:52:32.621 --> 00:52:36.991]  And using our Berkey Sport Bottles, it costs us less than two and a half cents per refill.
[00:52:37.292 --> 00:52:37.593]  Honey!
[00:52:38.413 --> 00:52:39.654]  You're terrific!
[00:52:40.055 --> 00:52:41.536]  Oh, honey, so are you!
[00:52:41.656 --> 00:52:45.060]  You're the one that bought the family our Sport Berkey Water Bottles!
[00:52:45.360 --> 00:52:46.121]  Now can we stop?
[00:52:46.641 --> 00:52:47.382]  I need to go, too.
[00:52:47.662 --> 00:52:52.127]  Get your Berkey Sport Purification Bottle for only $39 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[00:53:00.775 --> 00:53:08.701]  For years you've been hearing about Herbal Healer Academy and how it's remained a leader in effective alternative and natural medicine and education.

[00:54:06.108 --> 00:54:08.028]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:54:08.509 --> 00:54:11.250]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:16.391 --> 00:54:18.813]  Think about how infiltrated our country is.
[00:54:19.233 --> 00:54:20.294]  That's what globalism is about.
[00:54:20.334 --> 00:54:30.380]  It's about destroying national currencies, debasing the industries of free nations, leveraging them using the slave goods made by huge imprisoned populations in China and India.
[00:54:30.400 --> 00:54:37.365]  And then you got Rick Perry, the governor, his head of border and Mexico affairs, is a Mexican citizen.
[00:54:38.380 --> 00:54:41.842]  Dual citizen with the US, registered lobbyist of Mexico.
[00:54:42.522 --> 00:54:45.643]  And it's the same thing with people like Chertoff.
[00:54:45.763 --> 00:54:46.944]  Known asset of Israel.
[00:54:48.484 --> 00:54:51.666]  Family involved in founding Israel on the Maasai.
[00:54:52.366 --> 00:54:57.828]  And he's just up there butchering the Bill of Rights, the Constitution, right in front of everyone.
[00:55:00.109 --> 00:55:02.090]  And he's got his family writing hit pieces on me.
[00:55:03.246 --> 00:55:06.648]  It's scary, folks, how deep down the rat hole we've gone.
[00:55:06.708 --> 00:55:09.470]  So, Ed Haas will be joining us coming up.
[00:55:09.670 --> 00:55:14.234]  I mean, I've got the letterhead from the FBI with letters to the man that warned them.
[00:55:16.835 --> 00:55:18.096]  The Jewish American.
[00:55:19.737 --> 00:55:23.520]  And we've got the business cards.
[00:55:23.720 --> 00:55:24.901]  This is pretty powerful.
[00:55:26.222 --> 00:55:27.923]  Again, I'm reserving judgment on this.
[00:55:29.433 --> 00:55:34.254]  With the evidence we already have, clearly elements of Israel's crime syndicate.
[00:55:34.854 --> 00:55:38.115]  Our world is ruled by different crime syndicates working in unison together.
[00:55:39.395 --> 00:55:46.477]  There's no debating that, but this, what he heard, the things that were said, we have it up on InfoWars.com and JonesReport.com.
[00:55:47.357 --> 00:55:50.778]  What was said, what he heard, is powerful.
[00:55:53.459 --> 00:55:58.660]  We do have a former CIA high-level clandestine case officer joining us, coming up.
[00:55:59.654 --> 00:56:02.736]  In just a few minutes, but let's just get him on at the start of the next hour.
[00:56:06.619 --> 00:56:10.021]  But right now, let's get him on at the five after.
[00:56:11.522 --> 00:56:13.604]  Because I want to play that Oberman clip.
[00:56:13.644 --> 00:56:18.407]  I said I was going to do that concerning what's happening in this country with the police state.
[00:56:20.329 --> 00:56:22.870]  Newt Gingrich has struck again.
[00:56:25.572 --> 00:56:29.075]  And it's just he's such a despicable human being.
[00:56:30.003 --> 00:56:52.597]  He's given another speech, this time in Massachusetts, and he has, trying to find it here, it was in my stack, and he is explaining why he wants censorship of the First Amendment websites, and he said, well, you know, we've got to be able to restrict free speech now because Ahmadinejad threatened to kill Americans in his last speech.
[00:56:53.478 --> 00:56:55.099]  It's nowhere in the speech, it's a lie,
[00:56:56.047 --> 00:57:12.559]  But they know the average American is not going to read Ahmadinejad's letter to the American people about how noble we are, and how good we are, and he knows a crime syndicate runs our country, and not that they're not a crime syndicate over there, by the way.
[00:57:12.859 --> 00:57:13.880]  That's what power is like.
[00:57:14.721 --> 00:57:15.641]  Evil in high places.
[00:57:15.701 --> 00:57:16.402]  Power corrupts.
[00:57:16.882 --> 00:57:22.886]  The actual quote is, power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.
[00:57:24.548 --> 00:57:25.088]  It's that simple.
[00:57:26.696 --> 00:57:27.617]  And that has happened.
[00:57:28.077 --> 00:57:30.939]  But we'll get into Gingrich when I dig it out.
[00:57:31.399 --> 00:57:36.502]  Actually, with steel, because that's what he's into, is censorship and attacks on free speech, and a lot more.
[00:57:36.822 --> 00:57:53.532]  Before I end this hour, if you want to support what we're doing, you need to go to the online video and bookstore, InfoWars.com, and peruse all the great deals on all my films, 15 of them, my book, Paul Watson's book, the other books and videos we carry, like American Freedom to Fascism,
[00:57:54.719 --> 00:57:59.020]  Loose Change 2nd Edition, 9-11 Mysteries Demolitions, Terror Storm.
[00:57:59.380 --> 00:58:03.541]  We've got discounts there where you can get my films as low as $5.95 apiece.
[00:58:04.261 --> 00:58:06.161]  Or you can get t-shirts as cheap as $9.95.
[00:58:06.241 --> 00:58:11.623]  These are nice t-shirts, Inside Job t-shirts, Second Amendment t-shirts, stuff like that.
[00:58:13.243 --> 00:58:15.904]  Amazing deals at InfoWars.com.
[00:58:16.384 --> 00:58:18.544]  And we will get it to you before Christmas.
[00:58:18.704 --> 00:58:19.884]  We ship it out to you UPS ground.
[00:58:19.904 --> 00:58:21.405]  It takes about three days on average.
[00:58:21.605 --> 00:58:22.405]  Could take as many as five.
[00:58:23.115 --> 00:58:25.958]  We cut off, you know, the 15th is the last day.
[00:58:25.978 --> 00:58:27.459]  You get your orders in by the 15th.
[00:58:28.180 --> 00:58:29.140]  That's only 10 days.
[00:58:30.962 --> 00:58:32.323]  And we will ship it to you.
[00:58:32.423 --> 00:58:33.424]  Or you can drop ship it.
[00:58:33.464 --> 00:58:35.326]  You can tell us what address you want it sent to.
[00:58:35.786 --> 00:58:37.127]  Just make sure the address is right.
[00:58:37.147 --> 00:58:39.549]  You can even put it in the comments section and put a note into them.
[00:58:41.511 --> 00:58:45.755]  Order a copy of this show for your friends and family at GCNlive.com or call 877-300-7645.
[00:58:57.413 --> 00:58:58.053]  Big Brother.
[00:58:58.713 --> 00:58:59.793]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.494 --> 00:59:01.614]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.254 --> 00:59:03.094]  You want answers?
[00:59:03.815 --> 00:59:04.735]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.375 --> 00:59:09.116]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.556 --> 00:59:13.698]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:22.980 --> 00:59:24.441]  Robert David Steele.
[00:59:25.251 --> 00:59:33.048]  He's a former high-level case in the field officer and a real, the actual physical intelligence type spy.
[00:59:34.471 --> 00:59:35.053]  Spy runner.
[00:59:35.811 --> 00:59:39.675]  Intelligence Gatherer, really a great futurist and researcher.
[00:59:39.935 --> 00:59:42.097]  He'll be joining us coming up in about five minutes.
[00:59:42.157 --> 00:59:45.000]  Last time he was on with us, it made international headlines.
[00:59:45.260 --> 00:59:50.725]  It was in major newspapers and publications, the stuff he broke here on air.
[00:59:50.985 --> 00:59:57.332]  We'll get more into censorship, Google in bed with the CIA, government-sponsored terror, and a lot more with him.
[00:59:57.632 --> 01:00:00.875]  Then Ed Haas joins us coming up with a huge story
[01:00:01.722 --> 01:00:06.186]  About 9-11, government involvement and evidence in the third hour.
[01:00:20.908 --> 01:00:21.808]  Just a police state.
[01:00:22.009 --> 01:00:22.369]  Here it is.
[01:00:22.949 --> 01:00:28.791]  It was in December of last year that we first learned the president had authorized domestic spying by the National Security Agency.
[01:00:28.831 --> 01:00:37.215]  Tonight at the start of this December comes word that eavesdropping might be just the proverbial tip of the iceberg when it comes to the federal government's surveillance on its own citizens.
[01:00:37.595 --> 01:00:43.740]  It seems not being on the no-fly list is no longer enough to keep someone out of the clutches of the Bush administration.
[01:00:44.020 --> 01:00:48.424]  The Associated Press reporting that millions of American citizens entering or leaving the U.S.
[01:00:48.744 --> 01:00:58.512]  in the past four years have been assigned a secret terror rating based on such bizarre factors as number of one-way trips taken, seating preferences, dining preferences.
[01:00:58.532 --> 01:00:59.172]  It gets worse.
[01:00:59.612 --> 01:01:06.017]  Travelers are not allowed to see nor challenge the computer-generated scores which the government plans to keep on file for up to 40 years.
[01:01:06.858 --> 01:01:14.022]  The Democrat Patrick Leahy, the incoming chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, today expressing outrage, promising scrutiny of the program in the new Congress.
[01:01:14.422 --> 01:01:26.469]  One can only imagine how outraged Senator Leahy might be at seeing this other thing, the kind of image taken by a new federal screening system, x-raying the passengers' bodies to detect concealed explosives and other weapons.
[01:01:26.989 --> 01:01:28.592]  That's apparently not all it can detect.
[01:01:28.992 --> 01:01:41.111]  The Transportation Security Administration planning to have one such machine up and running at Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport by Christmas, if you have been roped into spending the holidays with the in-laws in Scottsdale.
[01:01:41.798 --> 01:01:46.800]  Here is your perfect excuse, or go greyhound, for a constitutionality x-ray.
[01:01:46.820 --> 01:01:51.802]  I'm joined now by George Washington University law professor and constitutional law expert, Jonathan Turley.
[01:01:51.822 --> 01:01:53.242]  Thanks once more for your time tonight, sir.
[01:01:53.643 --> 01:01:54.223]  Thanks, Keith.
[01:01:54.563 --> 01:01:59.125]  Having now seen that photo, we can't not begin with the x-ray machine.
[01:01:59.145 --> 01:02:04.247]  It would seem, Jonathan, to be not just intrusive, but actually indecent, so much so,
[01:02:05.447 --> 01:02:11.871]  What is the difference between requiring passengers to subject themselves to that and simply asking them to strip off all their clothes before boarding?
[01:02:12.151 --> 01:02:17.134]  Well, maybe this is a recruiting tool to get TSA applicants, which will now be called TNA or something, I don't know.
[01:02:17.574 --> 01:02:24.678]  But most of us are more afraid we'll be sent to something like Jenny Craig than Gitmo after this, because it is a very revealing picture.
[01:02:25.098 --> 01:02:39.535]  And you know, on the serious side, there is real problems with having strangers looking at an image, even one with parts covered up, that still is pretty accurate in terms of what you look like under your clothes.
[01:02:40.135 --> 01:02:45.277]  And the Constitution recognizes that there are some unreasonable searches and seizures.
[01:02:45.337 --> 01:02:48.858]  I would have to say that this seems pretty unreasonable.
[01:02:49.699 --> 01:02:51.559]  I think most people would be horrified.
[01:02:51.579 --> 01:02:56.841]  You know, we've all seen these people gathered around these screens looking at what's in your luggage.
[01:02:56.881 --> 01:02:58.942]  Sometimes it looks like a coffee clutch.
[01:02:59.582 --> 01:03:03.984]  I think people would be horrified to know that their actual physical image was on the machine.
[01:03:04.524 --> 01:03:06.585]  Let's turn to this personal terror rating.
[01:03:06.645 --> 01:03:11.508]  I mean, it sounds terrible, but I'm having trouble nailing down what's particularly terrible about this.
[01:03:11.568 --> 01:03:12.588]  Is it the criteria?
[01:03:12.949 --> 01:03:18.312]  You know, when you use things like meal preference, that might be a kind of hidden racial or religious... Back it up.
[01:03:18.332 --> 01:03:19.412]  We'll play the rest when we get back.
[01:03:19.952 --> 01:03:30.558]  No, the problem is that it shows that they've already got databases on non-criminals, categorizing us all as criminals, and the database is a lot bigger than that from what Admiral Poindexter admitted they were doing four years ago.
[01:03:30.578 --> 01:03:31.939]  It's hundreds of times worse.
[01:03:33.160 --> 01:03:41.450]  And I don't mention to you here that the government admits, and this is already now in six airports, this is the sixth, that they record your naked image.
[01:03:42.371 --> 01:03:43.011]  Okay?
[01:03:43.352 --> 01:03:45.655]  And most of the machines go in a circle and do a 360.
[01:03:45.955 --> 01:03:49.859]  So they have a recording of your naked body.
[01:03:50.360 --> 01:03:51.021]  Okay?
[01:03:51.101 --> 01:03:51.361]  Keep...
[01:03:56.124 --> 01:03:56.604]  It's here!
[01:03:56.824 --> 01:04:01.605]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:04:01.945 --> 01:04:09.627]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:04:10.307 --> 01:04:17.348]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:04:17.749 --> 01:04:24.590]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying,
[01:04:25.123 --> 01:04:29.166]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:04:29.466 --> 01:04:33.149]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:04:33.449 --> 01:04:35.350]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:04:35.690 --> 01:04:39.633]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:05:54.341 --> 01:05:59.762]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network, and I have an urgent message for our listeners.
[01:06:00.183 --> 01:06:04.944]  The mass media keeps telling us that we are the richest, most powerful economy in the world.
[01:06:05.324 --> 01:06:07.945]  If this is true, why can't we pay our bills?
[01:06:08.445 --> 01:06:11.846]  Why is the United States the world's largest debtor nation?
[01:06:12.626 --> 01:06:16.947]  The truth is that we are in the worst debt bubble in our nation's history.
[01:06:17.387 --> 01:06:20.568]  When the bubble bursts, will you be able to feed your family?
[01:06:21.168 --> 01:06:24.009]  When the inevitable crash occurs, will you be ready?
[01:06:24.787 --> 01:06:26.928]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.
[01:06:26.968 --> 01:06:28.849]  That's 1-888-892-6238 for the following two free reports.
[01:06:28.949 --> 01:06:29.009]  U.S.

[01:06:31.190 --> 01:06:31.470]  Call 888-8XANADU.
[01:06:31.490 --> 01:06:32.391]  That's 1-888-8XANADU.
[01:06:32.411 --> 01:06:33.051]  Ask for George.
[01:06:53.230 --> 01:06:58.895]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:08.162 --> 01:07:12.906]  Alright, I got a 20 paragraph bio here on Robert David Steele.
[01:07:14.725 --> 01:07:23.832]  And I think it's best with our guest for him to just tell you the audience that don't know who he is, some of the key things he's done.
[01:07:25.068 --> 01:07:26.708]  And some of the things he's doing today.
[01:07:26.988 --> 01:07:28.989]  Thanks for coming back on with us, Robert.
[01:07:29.349 --> 01:07:31.969]  Well, I'm very glad to be with you.
[01:07:31.989 --> 01:07:34.710]  Do you want me to just sum up my background in four sentences?
[01:07:34.930 --> 01:07:35.190]  Sure.
[01:07:36.070 --> 01:07:41.651]  Lived overseas all my life as the son of an oil man, Marine Corps infantry officer, recovering spy.
[01:07:42.572 --> 01:07:45.432]  Created the Marine Corps Intelligence Command and realized that the U.S.
[01:07:45.472 --> 01:07:48.713]  government is spending $60 billion a year on the 5% it can steal.
[01:07:50.797 --> 01:07:53.020]  And next to nothing on everything else.
[01:07:53.100 --> 01:08:00.571]  So my job in life today is to bring the world, but particularly the US policy establishment and the citizens that vote for it,
[01:08:01.261 --> 01:08:02.882]  Back in touch with global reality.
[01:08:03.042 --> 01:08:12.889]  And then after you were involved in creating the Marine Corps Intelligence Command, you were then involved in clandestine on-the-ground operations with the CIA.
[01:08:13.110 --> 01:08:14.010]  That was before.
[01:08:14.150 --> 01:08:16.452]  I did six back-to-back overseas tours.
[01:08:16.532 --> 01:08:17.873]  I chased terrorists in the 1980s.
[01:08:18.674 --> 01:08:24.678]  And in fact, I wrote an unclassified letter to Charlie Allen, who was then the National Intelligence Officer for
[01:08:25.396 --> 01:08:28.418]  Terrorism, and I said, Charlie, here are all the things we're doing wrong.
[01:08:28.498 --> 01:08:31.020]  Well, I found that letter, which was written about 1985.
[01:08:32.320 --> 01:08:37.103]  I found that letter in my files recently, and we're still doing everything wrong.
[01:08:38.765 --> 01:08:45.369]  Let's get into the Middle East, your analysis on what's happening with the James Baker Bush Sr.
[01:08:46.109 --> 01:08:50.412]  arm, the oil company arm, coming in and on the surface claiming they're putting the brakes
[01:08:51.112 --> 01:09:05.866]  To the neocons, what Cheney's visit overseas means to you, and then let's get into more on Google and the CIA and government-sponsored terror and have some time to elaborate on some of the things we talked about a few weeks ago.
[01:09:05.926 --> 01:09:08.388]  Boy, that made a lot of headlines, that last interview.
[01:09:08.929 --> 01:09:16.356]  Well, I was very surprised because the news had come out earlier, but it's obvious that you have more pull than the Homeland Security newsletter.
[01:09:17.078 --> 01:09:21.105]  Uh, because when it came out on your show 18 months afterwards, it really made news.
[01:09:21.165 --> 01:09:23.851]  It did not make news when it was published in Washington.
[01:09:24.151 --> 01:09:28.981]  And that may be because where it was published was part of the mainstream media that is captive.
[01:09:30.020 --> 01:09:48.790]  Well, I have to say that I can go on a national TV show that supposedly, like let's say, Good Morning America, supposedly with 8 million viewers at that time, and maybe get 100,000 visitors and 20 emails, but I can go on somebody else's show, just a mom and pop show on some 5,000 watt AM
[01:09:50.131 --> 01:09:53.673]  Taking your questions about Baker and Cheney, let me take them in two short parts.
[01:09:53.713 --> 01:09:56.475]  Number one, I regard James Baker and Warren Christopher
[01:10:15.553 --> 01:10:20.574]  Who was Clinton's Secretary of State as interchangeable good old boys from Wall Street.
[01:10:22.135 --> 01:10:27.256]  I consider the Iraq Study Group to be nothing less than extremely expensive lipstick on the pig.
[01:10:28.677 --> 01:10:35.558]  Bob Gates is going to be absolutely impotent as Secretary of Defense unless Dick Cheney is fired.
[01:10:36.058 --> 01:10:41.600]  And I realize an elected Vice President can't be fired, but I'm quite sure that he can get an offer he can't refuse.
[01:10:42.470 --> 01:10:50.255]  The bottom line here, and I sent the press release out yesterday, if you Google for OSS CEO on Google News, you'll get all my press releases.
[01:10:50.735 --> 01:10:59.120]  I also sent it as a fax to Congress, and I basically said, Bob Gates, the Secretary of Defense, is lipstick on the pig unless Dick Cheney goes.
[01:10:59.760 --> 01:11:06.184]  If Dick Cheney goes, Bob Gates could perhaps be one of the finest Secretaries of Defense in our recent history.
[01:11:06.924 --> 01:11:08.145]  Now, as to Cheney's visit,
[01:11:08.789 --> 01:11:10.810]  To Saudi Arabia, that tells me two things.
[01:11:10.910 --> 01:11:15.793]  It tells me, one, Condi Rice really is just a poster child.
[01:11:15.873 --> 01:11:18.154]  I mean, she's just a placeholder.
[01:11:18.194 --> 01:11:20.235]  She's not really our Secretary of State.
[01:11:21.215 --> 01:11:35.842]  And obviously, what had to be discussed with Saudi Arabia was way too important to relegate to Condi, whom I kindly say, if Bill Clinton was our first black president, then Condi Rice is our first Valley Girl bimbo Secretary of State.
[01:11:38.557 --> 01:11:58.722]  I think Dick Cheney went to Saudi Arabia in part because he is really in charge of the government and George Bush doesn't realize just how much power Dick Cheney has usurped from George Bush, who's a well-intentioned, really good-hearted individual that is in way over his head in part because his vice president has betrayed him from day one.
[01:11:59.222 --> 01:12:01.183]  So by that you're saying a complete puppet?
[01:12:01.933 --> 01:12:14.086]  I think George Bush is a good guy who means well, who is having his orders countermanaged by Dick Cheney behind his back, who is having Dick Cheney pretend that Bush has authorized things that Dick Cheney is ordering in the President's name.
[01:12:14.646 --> 01:12:19.351]  I believe that Dick Cheney is a major cancer in this government.
[01:12:19.810 --> 01:12:25.860]  And if we're to do anything with these last two years, Dick Cheney has got to be kicked out of office.
[01:12:25.960 --> 01:12:31.188]  But then we've got Dick Cheney supporters and he wouldn't be there if he didn't have a lot of power behind him.
[01:12:31.208 --> 01:12:33.652]  He was brought along by the Bush 41 machine.
[01:12:35.974 --> 01:12:48.705]  That's absolutely true, but I think that if you listen to some of the wise men, the Dick Cheney that we have in power today is not the Dick Cheney that they knew, he is not the Dick Cheney that they brought along.
[01:12:48.765 --> 01:13:00.696]  He has morphed into something vastly more evil and vastly more dangerous, and everything that I am seeing and hearing through open source intelligence says that essentially even Dick Cheney's most ardent supporters
[01:13:01.167 --> 01:13:11.400]  Are beginning to realize that he may be some kind of glue-crazed monster beneath that placid exterior, and he is in fact hurting his supporters as well as the President.
[01:13:11.680 --> 01:13:14.423]  He is certainly hurting the interests of every American.
[01:13:14.483 --> 01:13:19.410]  Now before we get into what he was meaning in Saudi Arabia and what you and others think that concerns,
[01:13:20.971 --> 01:13:25.313]  You have said that there's enough evidence to indict Dick Cheney for 9-11.
[01:13:25.353 --> 01:13:26.513]  You said that in a press release.
[01:13:26.533 --> 01:13:27.354]  You said that here.
[01:13:27.674 --> 01:13:30.035]  So clearly, you believe the evidence points towards him.
[01:13:30.635 --> 01:13:33.376]  Of course, we know he was in the bunker saying the order still stands.
[01:13:33.416 --> 01:13:35.197]  The plane's 50, 20, 10 miles out.
[01:13:35.577 --> 01:13:37.258]  Have you heard anything to the contrary?
[01:13:37.278 --> 01:13:37.999]  We have Minettas.
[01:13:39.819 --> 01:13:46.923]  Well, I attended a 9-11 truth meeting and I was very impressed by the quality of both the speakers, which included
[01:13:47.914 --> 01:13:51.856]  Wayne Madsen and Webster Tangley.
[01:13:52.597 --> 01:13:56.079]  I'm also reviewing a series of videos on 9-1-1 Mysteries.
[01:13:56.119 --> 01:14:05.524]  That's the series that has a tape on demolitions, a tape on hijackers, many of whom have been discovered, and airplanes, none of which parts, every part in an airplane is numbered.
[01:14:05.904 --> 01:14:08.446]  There have been no parts of the airplanes actually found.
[01:14:09.225 --> 01:14:13.208]  And then the whole war game thing where Cheney was controlling the government.
[01:14:13.808 --> 01:14:15.009]  And finally, who benefits?
[01:14:15.089 --> 01:14:22.434]  Namely, Wall Street and the people who were able to insure themselves and evacuate their most precious possessions from the World Trade Center.
[01:14:22.454 --> 01:14:27.858]  And of course, all the law files, all the files of securities investigations that were destroyed.
[01:14:28.425 --> 01:14:34.106]  And basically inoculated white-collar criminals from ongoing investigations and prosecutions.
[01:14:34.126 --> 01:14:37.927]  We even have two FBI agents that quietly went to prison for insider trading.
[01:14:38.127 --> 01:14:43.068]  They were not responsible for the lion's share of it that led back to Alex Brown and Co.
[01:14:43.128 --> 01:14:44.368]  and Buzzy Crongaard.
[01:14:44.388 --> 01:14:45.709]  Yes, Buzzy Crongaard.
[01:14:45.729 --> 01:14:47.529]  He will see justice one day.
[01:14:47.649 --> 01:14:51.930]  Now, let me say to you, because I think we need to have a peaceful resolution.
[01:14:52.814 --> 01:15:02.883]  I don't believe that we're going to be able to indict and convict people like Dick Cheney and George Tenet and Buzzy Cronegard in such a manner as to put them in jail for life.
[01:15:03.404 --> 01:15:14.254]  But I do believe that we can do what is now being done, has been done in South Africa, is now being done in Uruguay and Argentina and other countries, which is we can have truth and reconciliation commissions.
[01:15:14.867 --> 01:15:22.712]  We can out these people, and clearly tar and feather them in the public eye, and certainly Dick Cheney and Buzzy Kroengarter, two of my top targets.
[01:15:22.772 --> 01:15:24.893]  So convict them in the court of public opinion.
[01:15:24.953 --> 01:15:25.673]  Exactly.
[01:15:26.014 --> 01:15:41.763]  And at the same time, at the same time, using that as a virtual amnesty, state very, very clearly that anyone, from this moment forward, who betrays the public trust is going to be turned into dog meat and buried six feet deep.
[01:15:43.391 --> 01:15:47.534]  Now, I want to get into why Cheney went to Saudi Arabia, and this is really important.
[01:15:48.035 --> 01:15:50.157]  You talk to a lot of former people in intelligence.
[01:15:50.497 --> 01:15:52.458]  You talk to a lot of people who are currently in intelligence.
[01:15:52.779 --> 01:15:57.102]  We interview a lot of them here on air, and they told us what their sense is.
[01:15:58.103 --> 01:16:00.445]  They told us that the majority of people in intelligence
[01:16:01.113 --> 01:16:02.654]  I will give you a purely speculative take, alright?
[01:16:02.674 --> 01:16:04.014]  Based on my reading and my life experience.
[01:16:29.489 --> 01:16:55.816]  My speculative take is that Al-Qaeda, with the help of the Pakistani Intelligence Service, which is generally controlled by radicals, that Al-Qaeda actually put into place a plan for hijacking airplanes and for doing attacks against major cultural icons in the United States, including not only the World Trade Center, but the Sears Building in Chicago, the Bank Building in San Francisco, and possibly even the Capitol.
[01:16:58.041 --> 01:16:59.342]  And I believe that was ongoing.
[01:16:59.362 --> 01:17:02.523]  And I believe that Pakistan told Cheney two things.
[01:17:02.563 --> 01:17:04.504]  It said, number one, we can't stop this.
[01:17:05.325 --> 01:17:09.107]  And number two, we can control it, and it may be in your best interest.
[01:17:09.607 --> 01:17:20.673]  Because you know that the neocons have for a long time understood that the common sense of the American people can only be overridden by a cataclysmic event that causes everyone to just lose consciousness.
[01:17:21.233 --> 01:17:24.595]  And I believe that Dick Cheney took over
[01:17:25.926 --> 01:17:39.726]  This planned attack, I believe that the 100,000 from the Pakistani Intelligence Service to Mohammed Atta was part of a plan that had been approved at the last minute by the White House as a means of creating a major
[01:17:40.587 --> 01:18:05.310]  uh... event that would allow the white house to then go to war in iraq without justification but then uh... but then how do you match that we have british intelligences you got a lot of control as well and in the pakistan with uh... the dean of the defense language school going look we train some of these people here these are government agents uh... we have the uh... i've talked to the embassy heads who say we were blocking him from getting uh... visas back in and c.i.a.
[01:18:05.430 --> 01:18:06.831]  insisted all i can look
[01:18:07.231 --> 01:18:09.014]  I think this has been going on for a while.
[01:18:09.214 --> 01:18:14.461]  I mean, remember, Bush has been in power and Cheney has been in power over Bush since the year 2000.
[01:18:16.624 --> 01:18:19.308]  There, I think, was a last-minute adjustment.
[01:18:19.713 --> 01:18:35.447]  But I think that this was indeed put into place, and I also believe that it's entirely possible that the, and I really want to stress, I cannot draw firm conclusions that would send someone to jail or to death, but I can definitely say this needs to be investigated properly.
[01:18:35.847 --> 01:18:40.832]  I think there is clear evidence that Boeing has created automated control mechanisms for airplanes.
[01:18:41.493 --> 01:18:42.915]  Uh, that could be put in place.
[01:18:43.737 --> 01:18:44.839]  Uh, and... Well, stay there.
[01:18:44.879 --> 01:18:46.342]  Let's talk about that when we get back.
[01:18:46.382 --> 01:18:46.783]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:18:47.084 --> 01:18:50.150]  You get Arabs on board, then you hijack it by remote control.
[01:18:53.144 --> 01:18:53.604]  Gold.
[01:18:53.925 --> 01:18:55.206]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[01:18:55.466 --> 01:19:01.571]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[01:19:01.751 --> 01:19:05.574]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[01:19:05.915 --> 01:19:07.816]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[01:19:07.856 --> 01:19:10.158]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[01:19:10.298 --> 01:19:16.824]  The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as the common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weaker

[01:20:55.965 --> 01:20:59.587]  Have you ever heard of the Genocide Convention Treaty to the United Nations?
[01:21:00.228 --> 01:21:04.110]  Did you know that it's a direct assault upon your freedom of religion?
[01:21:04.810 --> 01:21:13.395]  Did you know that if you mention perverted sex acts as being wrong according to the Bible, you could be arrested and tried for causing mental harm to others?
[01:21:14.356 --> 01:21:21.520]  It's already law in Canada, Australia, Britain, and Sweden where Christians are being tried and deprived of freedom of speech.

[01:21:52.176 --> 01:21:58.190]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism, but globalism.
[01:21:58.210 --> 01:22:00.094]  Globalists are concerned with what's
[01:22:04.022 --> 01:22:04.402]  We're good to go.
[01:22:30.640 --> 01:22:30.900]  I think so.
[01:23:05.839 --> 01:23:17.052]  Robert David Steele is our guest, veteran CIA intelligence officer running different ground operations around the planet.
[01:23:17.193 --> 01:23:21.338]  One of the founders of the modern branch of Marine Corps Intelligence.
[01:23:22.293 --> 01:23:25.855]  The second most senior individual in that organization.
[01:23:25.875 --> 01:23:28.816]  And he's done a lot of research.
[01:23:28.836 --> 01:23:33.018]  He's also one of the biggest reviewers on Amazon.com of their non-fiction books.
[01:23:33.798 --> 01:23:40.981]  And we are talking about the geopolitical landscape right now.
[01:23:41.561 --> 01:23:46.023]  Robert, I don't want to run out of time here, unless you've got more to say on 9-11.
[01:23:46.704 --> 01:23:50.125]  What do you think Dick Cheney is talking about when he was over in Saudi Arabia?
[01:23:50.165 --> 01:23:51.046]  What was the agenda?
[01:23:52.449 --> 01:23:54.890]  Well, Cheney's going to Saudi Arabia tells me two things.
[01:23:54.950 --> 01:23:59.231]  The first is this was too important for our Valley Girl Secretary of State.
[01:24:00.152 --> 01:24:10.455]  The second is that I think Dick Cheney is doing, my personal speculation, is that Dick Cheney is doing a last-minute bolstering of the Saudi regime.
[01:24:11.036 --> 01:24:14.817]  And what really confounds me is that the Saudi regime, while it has oil,
[01:24:15.558 --> 01:24:24.961]  Is sponsoring this very virulent, anti-American form of radical Islamic terrorism all over the world, while Iran is trying to control it.
[01:24:25.641 --> 01:24:33.644]  And so, from my point of view, I think that the White House has given a wink and a nod to Israel to attack Iran before Christmas.
[01:24:34.504 --> 01:24:40.446]  I believe that Dick Cheney went to Saudi Arabia to seek their approval for an Israeli attack on Iran.
[01:24:41.253 --> 01:24:49.078]  And I believe that Dick Cheney right now is single-handedly running American foreign policy to the detriment of the American people.
[01:24:49.118 --> 01:24:50.278]  Okay, but we know this.
[01:24:50.318 --> 01:24:51.159]  We know this.
[01:24:51.179 --> 01:24:57.943]  The single best thing we can do is demand that Dick Cheney leave office immediately before Christmas.
[01:24:59.369 --> 01:25:01.610]  So many people are saying the same thing.
[01:25:02.090 --> 01:25:04.091]  I've got sources in the military all over.
[01:25:04.231 --> 01:25:05.572]  Members of Congress are saying it.
[01:25:05.892 --> 01:25:08.053]  They're beating the war drums all over talk radio.
[01:25:08.614 --> 01:25:17.678]  I mean, you think they're really going to have the nerve to go ahead and attack Iran and trigger the economic crises at the bare minimum that that's going to cause?
[01:25:18.158 --> 01:25:19.399]  The short answer is yes.
[01:25:20.340 --> 01:25:22.001]  Israel is divided itself.
[01:25:22.061 --> 01:25:27.346]  I mean, I have many Israeli friends, especially scholars, Debka, Haratz.
[01:25:27.406 --> 01:25:29.448]  There are sane parts of Israel.
[01:25:29.868 --> 01:25:32.210]  There are also insane parts of Israel.
[01:25:32.850 --> 01:25:40.897]  And unfortunately, you have this whole, the Stockholm Syndrome you have, where genocide victims become the perpetrators.
[01:25:43.741 --> 01:25:48.206]  I believe that at the highest levels, Israel has become a genocidal state.
[01:25:48.686 --> 01:25:50.348]  It cannot understand reason.
[01:25:50.388 --> 01:25:51.709]  It will not listen to reason.
[01:25:52.150 --> 01:25:56.614]  It's violating its own policies right now by using cluster bombs against Lebanon.
[01:25:56.734 --> 01:25:58.236]  And do you?
[01:25:58.396 --> 01:26:01.579]  Isn't this, what we see over and over again, is just war mania?
[01:26:01.719 --> 01:26:02.780]  I mean, let's talk about Cheney.
[01:26:03.080 --> 01:26:04.061]  Five heart attacks.
[01:26:04.142 --> 01:26:05.343]  He's literally Darth Vader.
[01:26:06.523 --> 01:26:09.865]  Normally when people are that sick, they retire, they go away, they go play golf.
[01:26:10.266 --> 01:26:16.989]  He is just supposedly still working long hours every day, running around, flying here and there behind the scenes.
[01:26:17.029 --> 01:26:19.030]  He isn't seen sometimes for weeks at a time.
[01:26:19.330 --> 01:26:21.231]  He's so busy hopscotching with the elites.
[01:26:21.492 --> 01:26:23.433]  No, he's actually busy hiding his illness.
[01:26:23.553 --> 01:26:27.675]  Do you know that he had to insist that his debate with John Edwards be seated?
[01:26:28.035 --> 01:26:30.757]  Because he couldn't stand up for more than 15 minutes at a time?
[01:26:30.857 --> 01:26:33.898]  Well, I knew he had surgery on arteries in the backs of his legs, Jim.
[01:26:34.318 --> 01:26:35.659]  Well, he has a problem.
[01:26:35.699 --> 01:26:41.162]  Dick Cheney is a very sick man, and I hope that he either resigns or that his next heart attack is his last.
[01:26:41.803 --> 01:26:42.943]  Well, my point is this.
[01:26:43.043 --> 01:26:45.324]  He is running around trying to court the different elites.
[01:26:45.364 --> 01:26:46.825]  We know Israel is supporting him.
[01:26:47.706 --> 01:26:50.967]  And, you know, the Saudis, what a sick group.
[01:26:51.168 --> 01:26:51.968]  The botched group.
[01:26:52.008 --> 01:26:57.111]  They're kidnapping starlets in the United States at $30,000 to $50,000 a head, delivered to their Learjets.
[01:26:59.659 --> 01:27:03.020]  Okay, well I don't want to bleep out what you're saying.
[01:27:03.040 --> 01:27:05.040]  This is baloney!
[01:27:05.320 --> 01:27:07.861]  In fact, let's talk about that.
[01:27:07.901 --> 01:27:14.863]  I mean, it's well known that they were just kidnapping people from all over Central Europe because of their penchant for blondes.
[01:27:15.223 --> 01:27:17.663]  And this is admitted, and children's snuff films, all of it.
[01:27:18.184 --> 01:27:20.864]  But what's your evidence of grabbing American starlets?
[01:27:21.084 --> 01:27:23.745]  Well, we cover other atrocities.
[01:27:24.285 --> 01:27:31.289]  We actually cover the 10 threats identified by General Brett Scowcroft, one of the few American adults in the power circle.
[01:27:32.009 --> 01:27:39.033]  And among all the threats from poverty, infectious disease, environmental degradation, right below genocide you have other atrocities.
[01:27:40.314 --> 01:27:43.656]  Other atrocities largely covers two major crime areas.
[01:27:43.936 --> 01:27:45.797]  One is trade in body parts.
[01:27:46.397 --> 01:27:51.700]  This is where prisoners are required to give up body parts or where people are kidnapped and murdered for body parts.
[01:27:52.567 --> 01:27:53.848]  And this is happening everywhere.
[01:27:54.368 --> 01:27:59.009]  And the other major crime is the kidnapping of people for the sex trade.
[01:27:59.629 --> 01:28:01.670]  And this includes basically three levels.
[01:28:02.010 --> 01:28:09.932]  It includes, at the lowest level, kidnapping children for child molestation and exploitation purposes.
[01:28:10.653 --> 01:28:17.835]  It includes raiding Russian orphanages for girls at a young age who are then raised like cattle for sex slavery.
[01:28:18.462 --> 01:28:27.989]  It includes persuading foolish young girls from Connecticut to come to an audition in New York, and the ones that are stupid enough to show up by themselves get kidnapped and are never seen again.
[01:28:29.130 --> 01:28:34.334]  And then finally, at the very, very high end, for those who don't want to pay $1,000 to $5,000... Stay there.
[01:28:34.374 --> 01:28:38.357]  Let's talk about it on the other side.
[01:28:38.377 --> 01:28:39.598]  We've got a break.
[01:28:39.638 --> 01:28:40.258]  This is real.
[01:28:40.598 --> 01:28:41.179]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:43.581 --> 01:28:44.521]  We're on the march.
[01:28:44.962 --> 01:28:46.483]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.475 --> 01:28:50.257]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.619 --> 01:28:57.662]  I found this company online and they have this really unique variety of salt wellness products.
[01:28:57.882 --> 01:29:01.425]  I read some of the articles and ended up ordering this beautiful salt lamp.
[01:29:01.705 --> 01:29:05.788]  According to the company, they said that the salt crystal lamps gently purify indoor air.
[01:29:06.068 --> 01:29:07.008]  I was so amazed.
[01:29:07.249 --> 01:29:10.111]  I put it in the baby's room and it made a perfect nightlight.
[01:29:10.271 --> 01:29:12.132]  Both my husband and I could tell the difference.
[01:29:12.532 --> 01:29:17.777]  SoleilWellness.com is a unique company that offers salt wellness products from around the world.
[01:29:18.218 --> 01:29:24.124]  So, I went back to the site and ordered their Soleil Simple Natural Cleaning products, also made with Himalayan salt.
[01:29:24.384 --> 01:29:26.106]  I figured it would clean really well.
[01:29:26.126 --> 01:29:29.549]  The natural cleaning products worked wonderfully and there was no scent.
[01:29:29.749 --> 01:29:33.653]  This company has so many products my whole family can enjoy and feel better with.
[01:29:33.913 --> 01:29:35.375]  Plus, the service was great.

[01:30:53.164 --> 01:31:01.671]  According to a recent report by the National Institute of Health, high blood pressure is a major risk factor for heart disease and the chief risk factor for stroke and heart failure.
[01:31:01.891 --> 01:31:03.713]  It affects about 50 million Americans.
[01:31:03.913 --> 01:31:05.054]  That's one in four adults.
[01:31:05.441 --> 01:31:11.525]  Because many people have high blood pressure for years without knowing it, the American Heart Association calls it the silent killer.
[01:31:11.785 --> 01:31:15.468]  At ResearchedHerbs.com, we recognize your concern for your well-being.

[01:31:57.596 --> 01:32:00.858]  We don't need no thought control.
[01:32:14.251 --> 01:32:16.493]  We got Ed Haas joining us in the next hour.
[01:32:16.913 --> 01:32:18.095]  He's got the letters from the FBI.
[01:32:18.355 --> 01:32:19.836]  They're business cards.
[01:32:19.956 --> 01:32:24.200]  This Jewish American was in the cemetery working on some stuff behind a wall.
[01:32:24.381 --> 01:32:25.342]  The classic story.
[01:32:26.022 --> 01:32:32.469]  And heard two people in the cemetery talking about when the towers get hit in September, they'll learn what it's like to be hit by terrorists.
[01:32:32.549 --> 01:32:34.851]  How the stupid Arabs don't know we're manipulating them.
[01:32:35.886 --> 01:32:38.287]  And he's called the FBI.
[01:32:38.527 --> 01:32:39.507]  I've made a phone call.
[01:32:40.127 --> 01:32:41.067]  These letters are real.
[01:32:41.127 --> 01:32:42.027]  These cards are real.
[01:32:42.067 --> 01:32:43.328]  This person did warn them.
[01:32:43.708 --> 01:32:47.069]  And it fits in with the FBI agents who were compartmentalized, who weren't part of the attacks.
[01:32:47.089 --> 01:32:49.429]  Obviously, 99% of them weren't involved.
[01:32:50.409 --> 01:32:57.031]  Who were out in Phoenix and in Chicago and saying, well, these people want to take planes off and not land them.
[01:32:57.051 --> 01:32:58.011]  They're saying they're going to do this.
[01:32:58.311 --> 01:33:02.152]  And the FBI had so much info, they were saying they've got a plane that probably hit the World Trade Center.
[01:33:03.004 --> 01:33:04.185]  Shut up!
[01:33:04.386 --> 01:33:06.928]  You'll be fired if you tell anybody!
[01:33:06.988 --> 01:33:08.710]  I'm not giving you a wiretap order!
[01:33:09.751 --> 01:33:14.296]  But this new info is pretty powerful and we'll vet it coming up in the next hour.
[01:33:15.558 --> 01:33:21.384]  I want to finish up with the child kidnapping rings, the slave trade with you Mr. Steele.
[01:33:21.424 --> 01:33:24.647]  But then I want to talk about how we stop an attack on Iran.
[01:33:25.603 --> 01:33:45.898]  People in the know, big talk show hosts nationally who are tied to the Republican Party, are saying before Christmas, and we're talking in the next 20 days boys and girls, is there a way to avert that, but first finish up with the, I mean because it has come out in the news here and there, but it's kept very quiet about how big, well the UN said,
[01:33:47.543 --> 01:33:55.606]  That from 2000 to 2002, 1.2 million women and children were kidnapped out of Central and Eastern Europe alone.
[01:33:55.907 --> 01:33:57.707]  I mean, that is huge!
[01:33:57.967 --> 01:34:06.051]  But, I mean, go back to what you were saying about the girls, the teenage girls getting tricked for modeling up in New York, and then, oh, come for a drink on the jet!
[01:34:06.931 --> 01:34:07.511]  Tell us about it.
[01:34:08.152 --> 01:34:11.653]  Well, you know, all I can say is this stuff happens all around us.
[01:34:11.733 --> 01:34:15.895]  I mean, people don't realize how many people disappear, including from cruise lines.
[01:34:17.514 --> 01:34:22.260]  You know, it's just there is this enormous lack of accountability and lack of attention.
[01:34:23.101 --> 01:34:37.477]  And I would just say to you, if you are ever invited to anything like this, make sure you not only take someone with you and have your cell phone with you, but also make sure they know that there are at least six different people that know that you're right there.
[01:34:38.477 --> 01:34:48.842]  Um, I, I just, I think crime, in fact, it's a documented fact, uh, Moises Naim's book, Illicit, crime is now a $2 trillion a year industry.
[01:34:49.322 --> 01:34:56.026]  And just to put this in the context of the legal economy of the world, the legal economy of the world is no more than $7 trillion.
[01:34:56.626 --> 01:34:59.587]  Crime is now $2 trillion.
[01:35:00.088 --> 01:35:02.109]  Legal economy is $7 trillion.
[01:35:02.309 --> 01:35:06.811]  And it's gradually moving where crime is going to become $3 trillion and then half.
[01:35:07.372 --> 01:35:14.857]  We're losing control of the legal economy, and what that means is we're losing the taxes that support social security and all that stuff.
[01:35:14.877 --> 01:35:16.378]  Well, that's what I've always said.
[01:35:16.578 --> 01:35:25.344]  And the crime has an advantage, not just being sociopathic or psychopathic, but they have the advantage of not having the taxes, so it puts everything else at a disadvantage.
[01:35:25.864 --> 01:35:27.926]  And you could almost call it crime world.
[01:35:28.406 --> 01:35:35.531]  And that's what I've likened it to, where, you know, I mean, take the Aztecs and the Mayan culture, Apocalypto coming out in a few days,
[01:35:36.231 --> 01:35:36.712]  Absolutely right!
[01:35:36.732 --> 01:35:38.233]  Absolutely right!
[01:36:05.834 --> 01:36:07.015]  Is there any way to stop it?
[01:36:07.095 --> 01:36:10.018]  I mean... Yes, I think there is a way to stop it.
[01:36:10.658 --> 01:36:22.669]  And I believe that every one of your listeners and every American, every actual person is a person of generally goodwill, and all they're lacking is the knowledge and the connectivity.
[01:36:22.829 --> 01:36:28.414]  And what the Internet has provided all of us is with a chance to not only come together, but to share knowledge.
[01:36:28.434 --> 01:36:29.015]  For example,
[01:36:29.710 --> 01:36:41.036]  The President's Daily Brief, which is a top-secret briefing for the President of the United States, costs the taxpayer $1.2 billion a week to produce.
[01:36:41.857 --> 01:36:45.679]  That's the $60 billion cost of the secret intelligence world divided by 52 weeks.
[01:36:45.719 --> 01:36:46.279]  $1.2 billion a week.
[01:36:46.299 --> 01:36:48.880]  For $500 a week, I am publishing free to the public
[01:36:54.893 --> 01:37:08.579]  A review, generally an 8- to 9-page review of global reality, the Weekend Review, where we cover the 10 threats from poverty, infectious disease, all the way down to terrorism, genocide, transnational crime.
[01:37:09.020 --> 01:37:21.325]  We cover the 12 policies that the United States should be pursuing in a coherent fashion, and we cover the 8 challengers from Brazil and China through Russia, Venezuela, and then wild cards like radical Islam.
[01:37:21.744 --> 01:37:24.425]  The bottom line here is there is no lack of knowledge.
[01:37:24.545 --> 01:37:31.629]  Our problem right now is that Washington decisions are made based on who's paid what, not on what the people need.
[01:37:32.089 --> 01:37:34.490]  And they're not made long-term.
[01:37:34.510 --> 01:37:37.952]  It's just crony networks and they're cloistered ivory towers.
[01:37:37.972 --> 01:37:38.612]  You want to talk about that?
[01:37:38.632 --> 01:37:38.872]  That's right.
[01:37:38.892 --> 01:37:46.936]  And I'll tell you the big difference here, Alex, is that these people, including Dick Cheney, have not realized, not only that the public is now awake,
[01:37:47.594 --> 01:37:53.916]  But unless they have a spaceship ready to go to Mars, there is no place on this planet where they can hide in the next 10 years.
[01:37:54.378 --> 01:38:00.101]  And I anticipate the public taking back a great deal of their ill-gotten gains in the next ten years.
[01:38:00.241 --> 01:38:01.522]  Well, that's what I see happening.
[01:38:01.642 --> 01:38:11.107]  Either the parasite, the smart parasite feeds, doesn't overproduce, hides itself under the back of the ear on the dog.
[01:38:11.127 --> 01:38:18.511]  This is now like a hundred pound dog dragging around a hundred pound tick and the tick's getting fatter and fatter.
[01:38:19.011 --> 01:38:23.314]  It's going to bleed out the dog and it's so stupid it doesn't know to stop.
[01:38:24.560 --> 01:38:37.290]  This has brought down so many other oligarchies and corrupt systems, when now their own enforcers, their own minions are setting up their own petty empires, and they're brainwashing the police, militarizing them.
[01:38:37.410 --> 01:38:41.913]  Gingrich is jumping around saying, you know, ban free speech, arrest everyone.
[01:38:42.194 --> 01:38:46.457]  National talk show hosts are saying, I should be arrested and I shouldn't have free speech.
[01:38:46.977 --> 01:38:48.579]  And I don't think they realize
[01:38:49.239 --> 01:38:52.100]  That they are waking everybody up doing that.
[01:38:52.220 --> 01:38:55.202]  I mean, I don't think they realize that what you just said is true.
[01:38:55.242 --> 01:38:57.803]  Listen, I do interviews every day on other talk shows.
[01:38:58.283 --> 01:38:58.943]  Every caller.
[01:38:58.963 --> 01:39:00.864]  I mean, we're talking one out of twenty might disagree.
[01:39:01.204 --> 01:39:01.904]  On the streets.
[01:39:02.164 --> 01:39:02.565]  Everywhere.
[01:39:02.945 --> 01:39:04.365]  I mean, let's say I get pulled over.
[01:39:04.785 --> 01:39:06.986]  I tend to speed and whatever.
[01:39:07.287 --> 01:39:08.807]  So I'll say I get pulled over twice a year.
[01:39:09.207 --> 01:39:13.309]  The police, nine times out of ten, let me go because they're fans.
[01:39:13.789 --> 01:39:15.550]  I mean, it's either got bad cops or good cops.
[01:39:15.710 --> 01:39:18.011]  My point is, there is a huge awakening.
[01:39:18.766 --> 01:39:19.767]  Well, I think there is.
[01:39:20.148 --> 01:39:32.582]  In fact, I did my first graduate thesis on predicting revolution, and concentration of wealth, excessive concentration of wealth, is the number one producer of violent revolutions around the world.
[01:39:33.321 --> 01:39:44.004]  And I believe today in America, we have not only an extraordinary concentration of wealth, but the average American, including myself, is back to the 1970s with respect to their earning power.
[01:39:44.344 --> 01:39:48.885]  We're killing not only middle-class jobs, we're killing honest blue-collar jobs.
[01:39:49.526 --> 01:39:51.786]  Walmart is killing honest blue-collar jobs.
[01:39:51.806 --> 01:39:53.587]  And that's because it's a predatory system.
[01:39:53.627 --> 01:39:54.667]  It doesn't know how to build.
[01:39:54.947 --> 01:39:56.548]  It is a predatory system.
[01:39:56.628 --> 01:40:01.749]  And it is also a predatory system that has forgotten the whole concept of community morality.
[01:40:02.379 --> 01:40:05.520]  And social justice and being right with one another.
[01:40:05.540 --> 01:40:08.500]  I mean, you have to ask yourself every day, am I right with God?
[01:40:08.560 --> 01:40:09.821]  Am I right with my family?
[01:40:09.841 --> 01:40:11.221]  Am I right with my community?
[01:40:11.701 --> 01:40:15.162]  And I think the answer for most of us these days is no.
[01:40:17.342 --> 01:40:19.223]  Getting back to Iran, what do you see?
[01:40:19.243 --> 01:40:23.503]  I mean, you and others are seeing an attack by Christmas.
[01:40:24.004 --> 01:40:24.864]  Could it be after?
[01:40:25.044 --> 01:40:26.544]  Or, I mean, how soon could it be?
[01:40:26.824 --> 01:40:30.645]  I'll say it's while Congress is not in session, but I believe it will be before Christmas.
[01:40:32.754 --> 01:40:50.517]  And I think that Congress is seriously irresponsible if it does not declare in writing, in public, that Israel will be absolutely cut off, will receive zero from the American taxpayer for the next four years if they attack Iran.
[01:40:51.207 --> 01:40:53.487]  Nothing but pain notwithstanding.
[01:40:53.627 --> 01:40:59.668]  Contrary to that, though, AIPAC's been running around, making sure everybody's in line, blackmailing, paying off.
[01:40:59.708 --> 01:41:01.709]  I mean, that's... Oh, absolutely right.
[01:41:02.129 --> 01:41:04.429]  And AIPAC is very, very good at blackmail.
[01:41:04.469 --> 01:41:10.950]  I mean, there are many people who think that Bobby Inman had to withdraw as a candidate for Secretary of Defense because of their blackmail.
[01:41:12.551 --> 01:41:20.352]  We're now getting, and I want to be clear here, because it's not just radical Jews and radical Islamists, but there are also radical Christians.
[01:41:21.151 --> 01:41:22.412]  Who undermine America.
[01:41:22.912 --> 01:41:26.015]  Extremism in all of its forms is bad.
[01:41:26.115 --> 01:41:33.079]  And right now, I distinguish between loyal American Jews and Zionist fanatics.
[01:41:33.179 --> 01:41:35.021]  Who believe that anything goes.
[01:41:35.121 --> 01:41:36.942]  They have a term form here in the United States.
[01:41:36.962 --> 01:41:38.023]  They're called Sayonim.
[01:41:38.563 --> 01:41:42.986]  These are people who will do anything that an Israeli secret agent asks them to do.
[01:41:43.507 --> 01:41:49.891]  Even if it means betraying their family, their employer, or their community, or their government.
[01:41:50.327 --> 01:41:52.028]  And that's something we have to put a stop to.
[01:41:52.909 --> 01:41:54.230]  Who is Benjamin Chertoff?
[01:41:56.012 --> 01:41:56.712]  Doesn't ring a bell.
[01:41:57.913 --> 01:42:02.838]  You know, I have this slip in my mind because Benjamin Chertoff wrote a big hit piece on me for Popular Mechanics.
[01:42:02.878 --> 01:42:06.861]  He's the first cousin of Michael Chertoff, excuse me.
[01:42:07.441 --> 01:42:08.843]  Oh, the Homeland Security guy?
[01:42:08.983 --> 01:42:09.183]  Yes.
[01:42:09.243 --> 01:42:11.345]  Well, I mean, who is he on that map?
[01:42:12.826 --> 01:42:13.346]  I don't know.
[01:42:14.107 --> 01:42:14.667]  I don't know.
[01:42:14.928 --> 01:42:17.530]  But, you know, it really comes down to common sense.
[01:42:18.226 --> 01:42:26.891]  Any American standing outside a 7-11 can probably tell you it's not a good idea to allow Israel to bomb Iran and to have four U.S.
[01:42:26.951 --> 01:42:31.934]  carriers right up against Iran where they can be taken out by supersonic sunburn missiles.
[01:42:32.334 --> 01:42:35.275]  The day that Iran sinks a U.S.
[01:42:35.335 --> 01:42:36.436]  carrier and a U.S.
[01:42:36.516 --> 01:42:42.099]  amphibious vehicle carrying 1,000 Marines in one ship is the day that U.S.
[01:42:42.219 --> 01:42:43.740]  superpower is over.
[01:42:44.220 --> 01:42:47.462]  It is the day that the big stick is splintered and burned.
[01:42:48.399 --> 01:43:04.823]  Well, I think they want to get us into a fight, because they know America, Americans, once we've been hit hard and are on the ground, we will go into mindless groupthink, and it'll be like Pearl Harbor, which they engineered, and we'll jump up, and the nuking will start, which Cheney and others have already called for.
[01:43:04.843 --> 01:43:17.806]  So I think that if Iran, let's say they bomb Iran, Iran fires back, blows up a few of these big ships, sinks them, damages them, the images of that, even normal thinking Americans will go into a red rage and say, nuke, nuke, nuke,
[01:43:18.246 --> 01:43:20.247]  Yeah, well, let's take this in two parts.
[01:43:20.347 --> 01:43:37.895]  First off, Iran is in very, very strong position because if there is an attack by Israel or by the Americans, and I wouldn't even put it past the Americans to very stupidly put Israeli colors on some of the airplanes launched from carriers, if there is an attack, Iran is in a self-defense mode.
[01:43:38.255 --> 01:43:42.477]  There is no question, but that such an attack will be a violation of international law.
[01:43:43.687 --> 01:43:51.631]  Kofi Amon, the Secretary General, has said that the United States was in violation of international law in invading and occupying Iraq.
[01:43:52.011 --> 01:43:53.952]  We are not on the right side of God here.
[01:43:54.652 --> 01:43:56.013]  We're not on the right side of man.
[01:43:56.093 --> 01:44:04.237]  Now, Iran has also said that if we nuke them, there are roughly 70 million people.
[01:44:04.997 --> 01:44:11.780]  If we nuke them, it will catalyze the other billion Muslims in the world.
[01:44:12.321 --> 01:44:17.306]  With the larger populations being in Indonesia, in Malaysia, and in India.
[01:44:18.127 --> 01:44:20.109]  So, we knew Quran, fine.
[01:44:21.090 --> 01:44:24.994]  That is going to be the beginning of the end of Western Christianity.
[01:44:25.973 --> 01:44:27.694]  Well, yeah, that lights the fuse.
[01:44:27.714 --> 01:44:31.356]  They want to push us into this final World War III scenario.
[01:44:31.416 --> 01:44:32.416]  That's the whole plan.
[01:44:32.456 --> 01:44:34.457]  Get us into a war we can't get out of.
[01:44:34.638 --> 01:44:43.142]  I will tell you that I personally, as a nominally educated American who reads a lot and posts a lot of reviews on Amazon, I will tell you I believe three things.
[01:44:43.842 --> 01:44:49.245]  I believe that Iran has a much sounder grasp of reality in the Middle East than does the United States government.
[01:44:49.925 --> 01:44:52.807]  I believe that Dick Cheney is a man of great evil,
[01:44:53.308 --> 01:45:02.538]  Who is undermining the President of the United States, who is usurping the power of George Bush personally, and who should be removed from government immediately.
[01:45:03.078 --> 01:45:10.847]  And finally, I believe that Congress, Democratic or Republican, is sleepwalking its way into the end of the year.
[01:45:11.634 --> 01:45:20.880]  And somebody needs to light a fire under them, because if Congress doesn't come out and publicly warn off the Israelis, I think we may have a very, very ugly New Year.
[01:45:21.120 --> 01:45:25.382]  Now, it is true that three mainline carriers are there, and then... Four, I think.
[01:45:25.663 --> 01:45:34.388]  Well, there's three big ones and there's a giant, kind of one of the huge troop-carrying... Yeah, but who in their right mind would put four carriers within range
[01:45:34.728 --> 01:45:37.050]  You know, it's funny, because Howard Bloom is a friend of mine.
[01:45:37.070 --> 01:45:40.151]  He's the author of Global Brain and also The Lucifer's Principle.
[01:45:40.552 --> 01:45:45.455]  He predicted the Sunni-Shiite world war back in the early 1990s.
[01:45:46.195 --> 01:45:48.196]  And he was talking about it as early as the 1980s.
[01:45:48.817 --> 01:45:51.238]  Like Steve Emerson, he's a man who sees the future.
[01:45:52.319 --> 01:45:58.242]  Emerson understood all of this with his PBS broadcast in 1994 when he taped Iman on U.S.
[01:45:58.282 --> 01:46:00.163]  soil calling for the murder of Americans.
[01:46:02.668 --> 01:46:15.212]  Howard tells me that he believes that Iran has been playing a strategic game from long before their destruction of Kobar Towers, and the FBI Director has said conclusively that it was Iran that blew up Kobar Towers.
[01:46:16.213 --> 01:46:22.555]  Essentially, Iran doesn't have the long-haul capability to attack the United States on its own shores.
[01:46:23.115 --> 01:46:29.197]  Howard believes that for the last four years or more, Iran has been playing a strategic master game
[01:46:29.781 --> 01:46:46.527]  To lure the United States land forces into Iraq, and to lure the United States naval forces into range of a Russian sunburned missile with a nuclear warhead, so that at one stroke, Iran can decapitate our land and naval forces.
[01:46:46.567 --> 01:46:48.287]  We don't have an Air Force worth mentioning.
[01:46:49.208 --> 01:46:56.550]  I think there is enough substance to that, to where I really have to question the sanity of any government
[01:46:57.048 --> 01:47:00.250]  That actually is allowing this to come to this kind of break.
[01:47:00.330 --> 01:47:12.799]  Now we know that the big marine troop carriers there, we know the three big mainline carriers, they never build up a force like that unless they're going to attack somebody.
[01:47:13.439 --> 01:47:17.462]  And the last three times we've seen this, they have gone into areas of the Middle East and Central Asia.
[01:47:18.683 --> 01:47:25.846]  What intel are you getting, or is it just the carriers being there is why you think they're going to attack before Congress comes back in?
[01:47:25.926 --> 01:47:35.950]  I've been getting all sorts of stuff, and if anyone really wonders about the plan, there's a book called The End Game by General McInerney and somebody else.
[01:47:36.451 --> 01:47:39.792]  This book, The End Game, was published a couple of years ago.
[01:47:39.852 --> 01:47:40.512]  It lays it out.
[01:47:40.552 --> 01:47:46.555]  It lays out the neocon plan to do Iraq, and then Iran, and then Syria, and then Egypt, and finally Jordan.
[01:47:47.037 --> 01:47:50.240]  Well, sure, the neocons, the neocons themselves said that.
[01:47:50.260 --> 01:47:55.045]  What you don't understand is that Hitler took over Germany with 25,000 people, okay?
[01:47:55.625 --> 01:48:06.855]  And what has happened here is the neocons have been put into a position of power, and even though they've frittered off, Wolfowitz is gone, Feitze is gone, I predicted Campbell would be fired two weeks ago, and he's gone.
[01:48:08.937 --> 01:48:12.681]  What is happening here is they have got the single most powerful position
[01:48:13.397 --> 01:48:14.357]  In our structure.
[01:48:14.437 --> 01:48:16.118]  They have Vice President Cheney.
[01:48:16.158 --> 01:48:17.719]  He's the last man standing.
[01:48:18.579 --> 01:48:24.321]  And I am absolutely persuaded that Cheney is being treasonous to the United States.
[01:48:24.361 --> 01:48:28.743]  So rather than lose power, you think they're going to do a Hail Mary and watch World War II?
[01:48:28.783 --> 01:48:32.184]  They've done Hail Marys before, and I will tell you something.
[01:48:32.284 --> 01:48:39.387]  It would not at all surprise me for Dick Cheney to do something as evil as tempting the President into getting drunk.
[01:48:39.427 --> 01:48:42.548]  He's a recovering alcoholic, like some of us around the country.
[01:48:43.080 --> 01:48:46.101]  I don't know if I would say that the President has been drinking or has been drunk.
[01:48:46.121 --> 01:48:48.781]  I believe the President is under enormous stress.
[01:49:05.549 --> 01:49:08.271]  And I believe that the Vice President is a big part of that.
[01:49:08.752 --> 01:49:15.257]  And I think the quickest way to relieve stress on the President and to move back from the brink with a run is to fire the Vice President.
[01:49:15.417 --> 01:49:19.960]  No, I understand you're beating that drum to fire Dick Cheney, but as you said, the neocons are still in the power positions.
[01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:26.045]  But you get rid of Dick Cheney and then you have more reasonable guys like Baker and Scowcroft and Bob Gates.
[01:49:26.185 --> 01:49:27.386]  I happen to like Bob Gates.
[01:49:27.924 --> 01:49:34.266]  I think Bob Gates needs to learn not to confuse loyalty with integrity, which was his problem in the Iran-Contra thing.
[01:49:34.586 --> 01:49:36.607]  But that's a common problem at the higher ranks.
[01:49:37.347 --> 01:49:38.627]  I have nothing against Bob Gates.
[01:49:38.647 --> 01:49:40.548]  He's an extremely smart individual.
[01:49:40.968 --> 01:49:44.829]  But the bottom line here is we need to insulate the President.
[01:49:44.909 --> 01:49:47.270]  I know Karen Hughes has been warned about this.
[01:49:48.350 --> 01:49:48.890]  Stay there.
[01:49:48.910 --> 01:49:49.431]  We've got a break.
[01:49:49.451 --> 01:49:50.131]  We've got a break again.
[01:49:50.151 --> 01:49:50.591]  Stay with us.
[01:49:56.528 --> 01:50:01.977]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:50:02.377 --> 01:50:10.009]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:50:10.703 --> 01:50:17.765]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:50:18.146 --> 01:50:29.549]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:50:29.890 --> 01:50:33.391]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:50:33.851 --> 01:50:35.771]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:50:36.112 --> 01:50:39.953]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:52:31.015 --> 01:52:31.536]  I think so.
[01:53:06.784 --> 01:53:10.185]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:53:10.345 --> 01:53:10.525]  Look.
[01:53:36.894 --> 01:53:57.682]  There was an Israeli plan in 1983, a Pentagon plan in 2002, to go into Iraq, to break it in three pieces, to have civil war as a pretext to stay there and build permanent bases and make over a hundred billion dollars a year just in weapons procurements and sales for that theater and for the feeding and fiddling of the troops.
[01:53:59.043 --> 01:54:01.304]  And so there's really a chaos principle here.
[01:54:02.533 --> 01:54:03.093]  Yes, we are.
[01:54:20.539 --> 01:54:21.660]  We're good to go!
[01:54:38.196 --> 01:54:38.997]  And it's horrible!
[01:54:39.457 --> 01:54:45.061]  And a lot of these soft Americans who are having their dollar devalued, it's by the very same crew, the very same globalists.
[01:54:45.241 --> 01:54:56.928]  So, you know, the globalists allowed the neocons to get in, the globalists allowed them to run with the ball, and then if they get burned, hey, they take the blame in history and this global elite moves forward.
[01:54:57.488 --> 01:55:02.092]  I mean, OPEC and a lot of other people wanted to go into Iraq and shut off that oil to jack up prices.
[01:55:02.492 --> 01:55:08.756]  A lot of people let the neocons run with the ball here, and so I don't think the buck can entirely stop with them.
[01:55:08.796 --> 01:55:10.257]  Mr. Steele, do you agree or disagree?
[01:55:10.658 --> 01:55:11.078]  I agree.
[01:55:11.238 --> 01:55:11.618]  I agree.
[01:55:11.698 --> 01:55:15.821]  I think you've got a very good, common-sense perspective on all of this.
[01:55:17.783 --> 01:55:18.783]  Well, where does it go from here?
[01:55:18.803 --> 01:55:22.266]  I mean, you really think that... I mean, when's the new Congress start?
[01:55:23.183 --> 01:55:27.044]  Sometime in January, probably mid-January, I'm not sure.
[01:55:27.064 --> 01:55:31.145]  Yeah, I think it's right after... I mean, it's usually mid-January.
[01:55:31.385 --> 01:55:34.985]  Well, so you think they're... I mean, everybody's saying this.
[01:55:35.005 --> 01:55:38.146]  You think they're going to... I mean, the carriers aren't there for no reason, but I hope you're wrong.
[01:55:38.166 --> 01:55:39.026]  I hope they don't attack.
[01:55:39.066 --> 01:55:41.987]  Look, the United States has never put forward carriers like that.
[01:55:42.047 --> 01:55:43.187]  They didn't do it in Vietnam.
[01:55:43.347 --> 01:55:44.767]  They have never done this before.
[01:55:45.307 --> 01:55:48.628]  This is either an incredibly stupid bluff
[01:55:50.374 --> 01:55:52.316]  Or an incredibly stupid plan.
[01:55:52.576 --> 01:56:01.702]  A lot of people have said they may use a false flag and maybe blow up one of the carriers or an auxiliary ship and claim that the Iranians did it.
[01:56:02.022 --> 01:56:05.585]  Kind of like a USS Maine or Gulf of Tonkin redo.
[01:56:06.265 --> 01:56:08.847]  Look, we have a history of doing stuff like this.
[01:56:08.947 --> 01:56:18.694]  My biggest concern right now is I know and respect the flag officers we have, but one of the problems that we have in the US power structure is people confusing loyalty with integrity.
[01:56:19.454 --> 01:56:33.266]  They are confusing loyalty to the chain of command, even though it's got too many morons in it, with integrity and supporting the Constitution and never forgetting that it's the people of the United States and the best interests of the people of the United States.
[01:56:33.286 --> 01:56:34.767]  Not the best interests of the corporations.
[01:56:34.827 --> 01:56:38.531]  Well, I saw... Not the best interests of the corporations, not the best interests of the neocons.
[01:56:39.464 --> 01:56:53.259]  I think this White House is out of touch with reality in part because Dick Cheney is buffering the President from being in touch with people who love him, respect him, and want him to understand that Dick Cheney is handing him his ass!
[01:56:58.479 --> 01:57:06.225]  Let me hold you a few minutes over and we'll get Ed Haas on because I want to, if you've got time, maybe just five minutes, because I want to ask a few other questions here of our guests.
[01:57:06.285 --> 01:57:09.767]  The websites are InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:57:09.807 --> 01:57:16.332]  We have a big link over to Mr. Steele's news service and website, as well, OSS.net.
[01:57:16.992 --> 01:57:19.074]  And please remember, it's the holiday season.
[01:57:19.114 --> 01:57:20.255]  The Info War is key.
[01:57:21.424 --> 01:57:25.666]  Get your orders in the next 10 days by the 15th to ensure you get them well before Christmas.
[01:57:26.246 --> 01:57:30.348]  All my books and videos, the online video and bookstore at InfoWars.com.
[01:57:30.388 --> 01:57:31.028]  We'll be right back.
[01:57:33.390 --> 01:57:37.291]  If you would like a copy of this show, come to GCNlive.com and reserve it today.
[01:57:37.611 --> 01:57:38.452]  Or call toll free 877-376-45.
[01:57:38.492 --> 01:57:38.792]  Big Brother.
[01:57:50.575 --> 01:57:51.616]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:52.337 --> 01:57:53.437]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.098 --> 01:57:54.919]  You want answers?
[01:57:55.679 --> 01:57:56.600]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.260 --> 01:58:01.024]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:01.424 --> 01:58:05.547]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:11.552 --> 01:58:19.979]  Alright, he was a CIA case officer in the field, helped found, the founder of the Modern Marine Corps Intelligence.
[01:58:20.838 --> 01:58:29.345]  And he is an author, lecturer, reviews books for Amazon, and he is a big speaker at the large hacking conferences and technology conferences.
[01:58:29.846 --> 01:58:35.271]  He is, of course, Robert David Steele, the website OSS.net, links to it up on InfoWars.com.
[01:58:36.369 --> 01:58:57.042]  We've got another guest coming up with huge breaking news for you concerning 9-11, but in the last few minutes we've got with you, last time it made big headlines, I mean literally dozens of major technology publications headlines, you know, that former CIA agent, you know, expert on these systems comes out and says that Google's in bed with the CIA.
[01:58:58.804 --> 01:59:02.769]  Now, of course, we know other organizations and groups are as well.
[01:59:03.130 --> 01:59:05.814]  Can you elaborate on that or comment on that?
[01:59:05.874 --> 01:59:14.746]  And then, the addendum, I don't know if you're aware of this, but I'm sure you are, Google has come out and said they're going to use the microphones and cameras that are on most computers to have passive
[01:59:15.774 --> 01:59:17.935]  Well, I'll try and do this very concisely.
[01:59:17.955 --> 01:59:22.377]  I'm also concerned about the fact that the FBI is now turning cell phones on.
[01:59:42.562 --> 01:59:49.884]  Unless you remove the battery from your cell phone, it can now be activated by the FBI, and they can listen to whatever your cell phone can hear.
[01:59:49.944 --> 01:59:51.144]  Well, they've been doing that since 96.
[01:59:51.424 --> 01:59:53.405]  Well, it's a very, very disturbing trend.
[01:59:54.085 --> 01:59:58.626]  First off, I think Google took money from the CIA when it was poor, and it was starting up.
[01:59:58.726 --> 02:00:06.088]  And unfortunately, our system right now floods money into spying and other illegal and largely unethical activities.
[02:00:06.488 --> 02:00:10.772]  And it doesn't fund what I call the open source world, which is both intelligence and software.
[02:00:11.093 --> 02:00:12.274]  I'm working to change that.
[02:00:12.334 --> 02:00:14.176]  In fact, I'm starting a new non-profit.
[02:00:16.178 --> 02:00:18.400]  Just how in bad is Google with the CIA?
[02:00:18.440 --> 02:00:24.166]  Right now, I would say it's a small but significant relationship.
[02:00:24.646 --> 02:00:26.628]  It is by no means dominating Google.
[02:00:26.648 --> 02:00:30.372]  In fact, Google has been embarrassed because everything the CIA asked it to do, they couldn't do.
[02:00:31.408 --> 02:00:33.750]  Uh, so Google is kind of off there.
[02:00:34.191 --> 02:00:38.815]  However, I think it's also very, very wrong of Google to have this relationship.
[02:00:39.175 --> 02:00:42.578]  Well, what do you think about them censoring videos and erasing my hit counts?
[02:00:42.618 --> 02:00:46.221]  Well, I think they're not only censoring videos, they're censoring press releases.
[02:00:46.821 --> 02:00:51.125]  Uh, I think that I've seen some press releases that are very critical of Dick Cheney and others.
[02:00:51.505 --> 02:00:55.609]  That somehow don't make it to Google News, even though they're released by PR News & Wire.
[02:00:55.629 --> 02:00:58.511]  Listen, we're exactly, which is a normal affiliate.
[02:00:59.172 --> 02:01:07.900]  I've been an affiliate of Google News, but they selectively do not add most of what I put in, and then months later, suddenly hundreds of our stories then show up.
[02:01:08.340 --> 02:01:15.784]  Well, I think that you have to recognize, I mean, I always say when choosing between incompetence and conspiracy, go with incompetence every time.
[02:01:16.205 --> 02:01:18.306]  I think Google has gotten way too big for itself.
[02:01:18.366 --> 02:01:23.509]  Google answers just self-destructed because Google wouldn't listen to all of us that were trying to help it.
[02:01:23.889 --> 02:01:26.590]  I think Google is long overdue for a public audit.
[02:01:27.031 --> 02:01:31.853]  And one of the problems with privatized power is that it's not subject to public audit.
[02:01:32.854 --> 02:01:36.336]  I believe that there is a marketplace for a handheld
[02:01:36.875 --> 02:01:42.038]  And a laptop that allows the end user to completely control all outgoing emissions.
[02:01:42.518 --> 02:01:49.423]  And I believe there's a desperate need for a citizen activist skunkworks that can thoroughly scrub stuff.
[02:01:49.483 --> 02:01:55.506]  And I absolutely believe that we should put Google out of business unless they're willing to go the open source software route.
[02:01:55.947 --> 02:02:03.071]  So, do you think all that coverage your interview got concerning their involvement with the CIA, do you think that concerned them?
[02:02:04.289 --> 02:02:06.331]  It concerned them enough to lie to the public.
[02:02:06.391 --> 02:02:06.991]  They denied it.
[02:02:08.372 --> 02:02:11.314]  But you have sources in the CIA that are involved?
[02:02:11.414 --> 02:02:16.197]  Let me say very explicitly, their contact at CIA is named Dr. Rick Steinhiser.
[02:02:16.217 --> 02:02:18.218]  He's in the Office of Research and Development.
[02:02:19.659 --> 02:02:24.603]  And you've got evidence that they took money, seed money, at Google.
[02:02:24.703 --> 02:02:26.104]  I don't have the receipts, Alex.
[02:02:26.204 --> 02:02:28.205]  I just know this from trusted individuals.
[02:02:28.826 --> 02:02:32.312]  So you have sources saying they're at the inception or shortly after?
[02:02:32.332 --> 02:02:33.954]  They've been together for quite a while.
[02:02:35.336 --> 02:02:35.657]  All right.
[02:02:35.717 --> 02:02:36.999]  Thank you, Mr. Steele.
[02:02:37.339 --> 02:02:38.481]  Oh, it's always a pleasure.
[02:02:38.501 --> 02:02:38.942]  Take care.
[02:02:39.022 --> 02:02:39.363]  Bye-bye.
[02:02:39.923 --> 02:02:40.304]  God bless.
[02:02:40.324 --> 02:02:41.225]  We'll talk to you again soon.
[02:02:41.646 --> 02:02:42.127]  Stay with us.
[02:02:48.027 --> 02:02:48.507]  It's here!
[02:02:48.727 --> 02:02:53.510]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:02:53.870 --> 02:03:01.534]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:03:02.194 --> 02:03:09.257]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:03:09.658 --> 02:03:16.541]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying,
[02:03:17.034 --> 02:03:21.096]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:03:21.376 --> 02:03:24.897]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:03:25.357 --> 02:03:27.278]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:03:27.618 --> 02:03:31.520]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.
[02:03:32.060 --> 02:03:39.503]  Get your copy today at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling toll-free 1-888-253-3139 or watch it right now online at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:03:44.577 --> 02:03:49.678]  Black Berkey purification elements are more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[02:03:49.738 --> 02:03:57.041]  These awesome elements are used in Berkey purification systems and they can also be used to upgrade most other gravity filtration systems.
[02:03:57.201 --> 02:04:07.824]  They can purify raw, untreated water by removing pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, trihalomethanes, and chemicals such as chlorine, atrazine, styrene, and MTBE.
[02:04:08.024 --> 02:04:12.565]  These elements also reduce unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[02:04:12.845 --> 02:04:17.849]  Unbelievably, they even remove small micro-particulate from water like food coloring particles.
[02:04:18.049 --> 02:04:20.991]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:04:21.231 --> 02:04:31.077]  Moreover, because they are recleanable, black Berkey elements are more economical than the standard disposable elements, providing fresh, pure water for less than 2 cents per gallon.
[02:04:31.097 --> 02:04:35.961]  Get a 2-pack for only $99 or a 4-pack for only $188 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:04:36.001 --> 02:04:37.962]  That's 888-803-4438 or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[02:04:42.646 --> 02:04:43.097]  We're good.
[02:04:45.213 --> 02:04:49.615]  You can legally eliminate credit card debt, which has been fraudulently created by the banks.
[02:04:49.955 --> 02:04:55.138]  Since its creation in 1913, the Federal Reserve has not been held responsible for its own debt.
[02:04:55.438 --> 02:04:58.639]  So why should you, the hardworking American, be harassed for yours?
[02:04:58.879 --> 02:05:06.022]  There's a double standard when it comes to being responsible for debt, and unlike the Federal Reserve, the people of this country can't print more money when needed.
[02:05:06.363 --> 02:05:13.526]  Day of Jubilee has created a successful program designed for people that want to stop harassing calls and threatening letters from bill collectors.
[02:05:13.786 --> 02:05:15.887]  This is not a debt consolidation company.
[02:05:16.288 --> 02:05:22.632]  Join the thousands of Americans who now breathe a sigh of relief because they have legally eliminated their credit card debt.
[02:05:22.852 --> 02:05:26.655]  Instead of living each day in fear, it's time to turn your life around.
[02:05:26.995 --> 02:05:29.557]  Call Day of Jubilee open 9 a.m.
[02:05:29.617 --> 02:05:30.437]  to 5 p.m.
[02:05:30.497 --> 02:05:31.698]  Central Standard Time at 920-293-8024.
[02:05:31.718 --> 02:05:31.898]  That's 920-293-8024.
[02:05:31.998 --> 02:05:32.819]  And ask for Robert.
[02:05:32.839 --> 02:05:34.300]  Don't wait any longer to get your life back in order.
[02:05:44.736 --> 02:05:49.761]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:05:50.141 --> 02:05:52.463]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:05:52.483 --> 02:06:02.893]  Ed Haas is our guest.
[02:06:02.933 --> 02:06:04.614]  We're going to him in just a moment.
[02:06:06.816 --> 02:06:10.380]  This story has been partially vetted.
[02:06:11.258 --> 02:06:27.464]  If it continues to pan out, which unfortunately it is, it's very sad, very scary, it is one of the biggest developments in the history of 9-11 truth that I, again, unfortunately am the progenitor of.
[02:06:27.484 --> 02:06:34.226]  I don't like having that position, and I don't like the fact 9-11 happened, and I wish the world wasn't so dark and so serious.
[02:06:34.966 --> 02:06:39.568]  But you just heard the former founder of Marine Corps Intelligence, and of course,
[02:06:41.255 --> 02:06:53.398]  Before that, a high-powered, on-the-ground spy, actually tracking people going up against him, saying clearly there's enough to indict Dick Cheney for being involved in the attacks.
[02:06:53.778 --> 02:06:54.618]  This is very real.
[02:06:54.899 --> 02:06:57.879]  That's why it's important that you get my film, 9-11, The Road to Tyranny.
[02:06:57.939 --> 02:07:00.820]  You get, Martial Law, 9-11, Rise of the Police State.
[02:07:01.180 --> 02:07:03.041]  And you get, Loose Change, Second Edition.
[02:07:03.081 --> 02:07:04.801]  And you get my new film, Terror Storm.
[02:07:05.741 --> 02:07:07.962]  And 9-11 Mysteries, Demolitions.
[02:07:09.531 --> 02:07:24.804]  Because by getting these films, you will have the record, the proof, the evidence, of how the military-industrial complex, in conjunction with at least three intelligence bodies, CIA, MI6, and Assad, orchestrated 9-11.
[02:07:25.385 --> 02:07:29.048]  A team effort, as they always team up.
[02:07:30.089 --> 02:07:35.073]  Please get TerrorStorm, and I'm asking you, we've got some new projects coming up in the new year,
[02:07:35.982 --> 02:07:44.764]  And we need the capital to launch those new projects that are going to be very effective in our prosecution of the war against the Global Crime Syndicate against the New World Order.
[02:07:44.784 --> 02:07:46.044]  But that's only one reason.
[02:07:46.084 --> 02:07:53.546]  The most important reason is they're informative, they're well-produced, they're documented, and they're changing lives.
[02:07:53.706 --> 02:07:55.446]  And we have woken up the majority of the people.
[02:07:55.486 --> 02:07:58.167]  Now we've got to wake up the other half of the population.
[02:07:58.187 --> 02:08:02.668]  84% in scientific polls believe they're being lied to about 9-11.
[02:08:04.424 --> 02:08:09.047]  36% of the scientific polls believe total inside job, with 68% believing massive cover-up.
[02:08:10.048 --> 02:08:11.589]  So now let's take the country back.
[02:08:11.749 --> 02:08:21.695]  If government-sponsored terror fails, if we are able to expose it, which we are now about to have victory, that will just derail many New World Order operations.
[02:08:21.715 --> 02:08:28.399]  It doesn't mean we've beaten them, but it means we're winning a major battle, and we're bloodying them, and I want to go on bloodying them.
[02:08:29.339 --> 02:08:30.980]  And understand, you have the power.
[02:08:31.020 --> 02:08:32.161]  This show has an effect.
[02:08:32.805 --> 02:08:42.989]  I mean, you heard Mr. Steele on saying he's basically never gotten a response like this, and we hear that from congressmen, we hear that from movie producers, we hear that from... because we have a big audience.
[02:08:43.089 --> 02:08:43.489]  It's big.
[02:08:44.250 --> 02:08:52.653]  But our millions of listeners, our couple million listeners, that's conservative in a week, dwarfs other shows with 10, 15, 20 million because they're not active.
[02:08:52.673 --> 02:08:53.573]  They're jellyfish.
[02:08:54.374 --> 02:08:55.214]  They're not active.
[02:08:55.294 --> 02:08:56.034]  You are active.
[02:08:56.054 --> 02:08:57.755]  We'll get even more active.
[02:08:58.863 --> 02:09:01.123]  So, we guarantee delivery to you.
[02:09:01.164 --> 02:09:02.244]  We ship at UPS Ground.
[02:09:02.304 --> 02:09:04.284]  So, the last day we take orders is the 15th.
[02:09:04.464 --> 02:09:08.505]  We keep taking orders, of course, but where it's guaranteed to get to you a few days before Christmas.
[02:09:10.085 --> 02:09:11.466]  UPS Ground might take five days.
[02:09:11.486 --> 02:09:12.426]  It usually takes three days.
[02:09:12.786 --> 02:09:14.946]  In fact, they claim everywhere in the country three days.
[02:09:16.667 --> 02:09:18.647]  We're getting the shipping just to a few days before now.
[02:09:18.667 --> 02:09:21.868]  We're trying to catch up to where we're shipping on the day as they come in.
[02:09:22.928 --> 02:09:24.368]  But then the weekends always get us behind.
[02:09:24.408 --> 02:09:25.729]  So, we've got extra people in here.
[02:09:25.749 --> 02:09:27.089]  We're going to have the shipments out to you.
[02:09:28.015 --> 02:09:28.656]  On the 15th.
[02:09:28.676 --> 02:09:31.297]  Whatever comes in the 15th will be out on the 16th.
[02:09:31.317 --> 02:09:33.459]  We're going to be here overnight and here on that Saturday.
[02:09:34.680 --> 02:09:39.263]  And so that's Santa's little elves here in the InfoWars.
[02:09:39.443 --> 02:09:41.424]  So please go to InfoWars.com.
[02:09:41.444 --> 02:09:43.286]  Look at all the specials, all the deals.
[02:09:43.646 --> 02:09:46.668]  T-shirts that say 9-11 Inside Job on the front.
[02:09:46.688 --> 02:09:48.089]  9-11 equals Inside Job.
[02:09:48.129 --> 02:09:49.370]  InfoWars.com on the back.
[02:09:49.390 --> 02:09:49.370]  $9.95.
[02:09:49.450 --> 02:09:49.610]  DVDs.
[02:09:49.650 --> 02:09:52.252]  My film is as low as $9.95.
[02:09:54.796 --> 02:09:56.057]  America, Freedom to Fascism.
[02:09:56.077 --> 02:09:58.518]  So go to InfoWars.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[02:09:58.538 --> 02:09:58.578]  888-253-3139.
[02:09:58.718 --> 02:10:00.299]  And you can also write to us.
[02:10:00.399 --> 02:10:02.740]  That's 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, TX 78704.
[02:10:02.800 --> 02:10:05.702]  Now, if you're going to write to us to get Christmas gifts,
[02:10:24.096 --> 02:10:35.885]  Or a birthday present or whatever, but for here on the holiday, you need to go ahead and get those off, I'd say in the next five days or so, because the mail might take five, six days to get here, especially with all the holiday mail going around, so we can get that out to you as well.
[02:10:36.265 --> 02:10:41.429]  So I'd say mail cutoffs probably, well it'll be the 15th too, but you better mail it long before then.
[02:10:42.070 --> 02:10:43.611]  So again, please take action.
[02:10:44.571 --> 02:10:48.434]  Or I guess you could rush deliver a check or money order to do that.
[02:10:48.454 --> 02:10:50.396]  I get so wound up in all this news, I forget to
[02:10:51.337 --> 02:10:54.998]  I forget to plug the videos and the books which are key in the info war.
[02:10:55.558 --> 02:10:55.899]  All right!
[02:10:57.339 --> 02:11:04.742]  Ed Haas has a lengthy list of great articles he's written the last few years.
[02:11:05.222 --> 02:11:10.764]  I found them to be very accurate, very informative, and very even-handed.
[02:11:10.964 --> 02:11:13.464]  He's done some real journalistic work in the last few months.
[02:11:14.185 --> 02:11:20.807]  I am here looking in front of me of two FBI agent business cards.
[02:11:21.835 --> 02:11:23.055]  I'm looking at a letter from the U.S.
[02:11:23.075 --> 02:11:33.558]  Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of Investigation, March 28, 2001, months before 9-11, to the individual that tried to go to them.
[02:11:33.658 --> 02:11:43.280]  I have a June 20, 2001 letter here, with his name blacked out, saying that they couldn't help him.
[02:11:43.580 --> 02:11:44.641]  And it's part and parcel.
[02:11:44.661 --> 02:11:45.861]  It isn't just this one report.
[02:11:45.981 --> 02:11:49.722]  It's all these other people, FBI agents,
[02:11:51.254 --> 02:12:11.959]  Flight school trainers who said embassy heads, the head of the Defense Language School in Monterey, California, saying they're going to hijack jets, they're going to attack America, they're terrorists, and being told shut up, back off, stand down.
[02:12:12.279 --> 02:12:15.260]  And then they get fired or reprimanded or demoted.
[02:12:15.540 --> 02:12:17.741]  The people that blocked them got record cash bonuses in 2002.
[02:12:21.471 --> 02:12:21.851]  All right.
[02:12:23.113 --> 02:12:25.455]  And we know the so-called hijackers were U.S.
[02:12:25.495 --> 02:12:26.076]  government agents.
[02:12:26.096 --> 02:12:28.058]  We know they were taking part in drill, decoys.
[02:12:28.758 --> 02:12:41.751]  You heard Steele, a high-level CIA analyst and field officer and the founder of what is modern Marine Corps Intelligence, telling you that he thought that, yeah, they were set up, they were on board the aircraft, remote control took control.
[02:12:42.112 --> 02:12:44.094]  That's what the evidence fits the closest.
[02:12:44.114 --> 02:12:45.515]  The official story is a complete lie.
[02:12:46.528 --> 02:12:50.771]  The truth is we don't know specifically, right down to the fine details, what they did on 9-11.
[02:12:50.971 --> 02:12:52.452]  We just know that they blew up the buildings.
[02:12:52.492 --> 02:12:53.433]  It's an inside job.
[02:12:53.753 --> 02:12:54.854]  Those hijackers were U.S.
[02:12:54.894 --> 02:12:55.594]  government agents.
[02:12:56.715 --> 02:12:59.777]  We know that the PNAC boys called for a new Pearl Harbor.
[02:12:59.797 --> 02:13:00.778]  I've prefaced this enough.
[02:13:03.200 --> 02:13:05.361]  This Ed Haas story is huge.
[02:13:06.282 --> 02:13:10.485]  We've got it up on InfoWars.com right now.
[02:13:11.707 --> 02:13:15.053]  And it's a story out of the Muckraker Report.
[02:13:15.394 --> 02:13:19.081]  Prior knowledge of 9-11 attacks overheard in Hebrew.
[02:13:20.157 --> 02:13:38.226]  And I guess what we should do, Ed, is in the next five minutes we've got kind of nutshell it, and then in the next 40 minutes that we've got together, after that break, we'll walk through the history of this and the phone calls you've made and the things you've done.
[02:13:38.266 --> 02:13:42.469]  Thanks for coming on, and thanks for your courage, because this is the type of story that'll get you killed.
[02:13:42.509 --> 02:13:43.129]  I hope you know that.
[02:13:43.149 --> 02:13:49.052]  I'm well aware of that, and I really appreciate the opportunity to come on your show and talk about it.
[02:13:50.216 --> 02:13:56.318]  In a nutshell, a reader of the Muckraker Report... Well, first off, tell us about Ed Haas, and then we'll do that.
[02:13:56.518 --> 02:13:58.339]  I'm the editor of the Muckraker Report.
[02:13:58.399 --> 02:14:10.702]  I started the Muckraker Report in 2002, and it started out pretty much as a libertarian-type news commentary website, and it's kind of evolved over the years.
[02:14:10.722 --> 02:14:15.064]  And this past year, our readership has grown.
[02:14:15.324 --> 02:14:17.385]  We had a few articles that
[02:14:19.284 --> 02:14:21.686]  You know, kind of spread around the internet pretty quickly.
[02:14:22.046 --> 02:14:48.944]  The FBI, no hard evidence connecting Osama Bin Laden to 9-11 was one back in June that, you know, really got a lot of attention because I had an FBI spokesman explain to me that the reason why 9-11 isn't mentioned on Bin Laden's most wanted posters was because the FBI had no hard evidence connecting him to 9-11, which, you know, that's just another small piece in this entire
[02:14:50.335 --> 02:14:51.736]  So your name got out there.
[02:14:52.316 --> 02:14:53.536]  Exactly, your name got out there.
[02:14:53.556 --> 02:14:55.157]  You got contacted six months ago.
[02:14:55.177 --> 02:14:57.218]  Tell us what happened.
[02:14:57.798 --> 02:15:08.742]  I was contacted by a reader who said that she knew an Israeli that lived in New Jersey who had a lot of information, that nobody had been listening to him.
[02:15:09.762 --> 02:15:11.723]  I try to follow all them through.
[02:15:11.903 --> 02:15:17.285]  If somebody tells me of somebody that nobody's listening to, I usually follow through.
[02:15:17.785 --> 02:15:19.046]  It took me a little bit of time.
[02:15:20.104 --> 02:15:29.431]  I finally did contact the individual, spoke to him on the phone on numerous occasions, had him hard copy some documentation to me.
[02:15:29.451 --> 02:15:35.975]  You know, I approached this individual as if his story was BS.
[02:15:36.015 --> 02:15:40.398]  You know, that's how I kind of had to approach it, is this guy might be a nutcase.
[02:15:40.858 --> 02:15:46.042]  Let's follow through, though, and see if his story starts to have merit.
[02:15:48.513 --> 02:15:58.058]  I reached a point where I felt as though this guy has some information based on his documentation, and it smells like more cover-up to me.
[02:15:58.679 --> 02:16:13.267]  And once I had received copies of the letters he had received from the FBI, basically this individual overheard a conversation in a cemetery in New Jersey, and it was spoken in Hebrew.
[02:16:13.806 --> 02:16:15.927]  He lives near the cemetery.
[02:16:16.827 --> 02:16:24.610]  He went to the cemetery to clip ivy for his garden.
[02:16:26.050 --> 02:16:27.010]  English ivy.
[02:16:27.191 --> 02:16:27.931]  He clips it.
[02:16:27.971 --> 02:16:28.991]  He puts it in water.
[02:16:29.011 --> 02:16:31.092]  Yeah, you can root it by just sticking it in the ground.
[02:16:31.652 --> 02:16:32.212]  Exactly.
[02:16:32.292 --> 02:16:36.474]  So he was just out casually going about his business.
[02:16:36.854 --> 02:16:40.855]  This individual is a former member of the Israeli Defense Force.
[02:16:41.155 --> 02:16:43.116]  He's a veteran of the Yom Kippur War.
[02:16:45.998 --> 02:16:47.538]  He's in this cemetery.
[02:16:47.578 --> 02:16:51.780]  He overhears a conversation he believes to be spoken in Hebrew.
[02:16:52.240 --> 02:16:53.621]  That gets his attention.
[02:16:54.901 --> 02:16:56.001]  He's curious.
[02:16:56.262 --> 02:16:58.122]  He walks towards the conversation.
[02:16:58.662 --> 02:17:03.744]  He is getting close enough to confirm it's being spoken in Hebrew.
[02:17:04.284 --> 02:17:05.585]  He moves a little closer.
[02:17:06.454 --> 02:17:13.000]  Uh, the way the cemetery's set up, and I did research on the cemetery, uh, to confirm it.
[02:17:13.100 --> 02:17:16.423]  I mean, this is sort of the stuff I did, is confirm the cemetery.
[02:17:16.443 --> 02:17:16.763]  Fix it.
[02:17:16.783 --> 02:17:17.944]  Uh, confirm the FBI.
[02:17:18.104 --> 02:17:18.565]  Stay there.
[02:17:18.585 --> 02:17:19.966]  You gotta break, Ed.
[02:17:20.006 --> 02:17:21.607]  We're gonna come back and go over what he heard.
[02:17:21.627 --> 02:17:25.431]  And then he contacted the FBI, and we've got the evidence that he did indeed do that.
[02:17:25.971 --> 02:17:27.552]  And you vetted at least that far.
[02:17:27.613 --> 02:17:28.593]  This is amazing.
[02:17:29.354 --> 02:17:31.276]  And I want to tell him, now that he's talked to you,
[02:17:32.174 --> 02:17:35.656]  Now that you've contacted the FBI, the globalists know who this guy is.
[02:17:35.696 --> 02:17:37.857]  He better go public right now.
[02:17:38.318 --> 02:17:40.579]  He is in grave danger.
[02:17:40.599 --> 02:17:51.025]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson, here for the 2007 Red Book.
[02:17:52.226 --> 02:17:57.049]  The commodity markets like gold, silver, copper, aluminum and oil have exploded over the last year.
[02:17:57.249 --> 02:17:59.990]  This is a glaring testimony of how quickly the U.S.
[02:18:00.030 --> 02:18:01.131]  dollar can be devalued.
[02:18:02.483 --> 02:18:07.067]  Many have turned to precious metals to provide a safe haven while increasing the potential profits.
[02:18:07.987 --> 02:18:15.273]  Though accumulating precious metals has been a proven method for the storage of wealth, it is important that you understand the market you are getting into.
[02:18:16.274 --> 02:18:19.336]  Midas Resources is offering the Red Book and Silver Dollar for only $27.95.
[02:18:20.237 --> 02:18:24.941]  The Red Book is the number one best-selling guide to gold and silver coins.
[02:18:25.922 --> 02:18:27.203]  Call for your copy today.
[02:18:27.243 --> 02:18:27.423]  It's 800-686-2237.
[02:18:30.680 --> 02:18:36.529]  If you've already accumulated or plan to get into the precious metals market, you simply must have the Red Book in your library.
[02:18:37.230 --> 02:18:37.650]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:18:37.690 --> 02:18:37.890]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:18:45.009 --> 02:18:53.276]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[02:18:53.517 --> 02:18:57.880]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[02:18:58.181 --> 02:19:07.089]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[02:19:07.309 --> 02:19:10.912]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[02:19:11.192 --> 02:19:16.235]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[02:19:16.516 --> 02:19:23.260]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[02:19:23.740 --> 02:19:24.281]  What about you?
[02:19:25.032 --> 02:19:30.395]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[02:19:45.434 --> 02:19:48.036]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:19:48.476 --> 02:19:52.958]  Did you know there's a secret group that wants the government to spend itself in the bankruptcy?
[02:19:53.478 --> 02:19:59.742]  Did you know that current President Bush has the largest percentage of increase in spending than any Democrat has ever had?
[02:20:00.482 --> 02:20:01.023]  We're good to go.
[02:20:16.937 --> 02:20:17.077]  516-8736.
[02:20:17.277 --> 02:20:17.957]  That's 1-800-516-8736.

[02:20:45.185 --> 02:20:45.705]  Hey Emily!
[02:20:46.006 --> 02:20:46.906]  Wow, you look great!
[02:20:47.266 --> 02:20:48.067]  I feel great.
[02:20:48.307 --> 02:20:50.248]  I've been using MediCleanse Colon Cleanse.
[02:20:50.608 --> 02:20:50.908]  Really?
[02:20:51.149 --> 02:20:51.549]  What is it?
[02:20:51.709 --> 02:20:52.149]  How does it work?
[02:20:52.289 --> 02:20:58.733]  Well, MediCleanse is a natural fiber therapy with ground flaxseed, psyllium, and bentonite clay that eliminates toxins from the body.
[02:20:58.853 --> 02:21:01.115]  MediCleanse is easy to use without being intrusive.
[02:21:01.295 --> 02:21:06.418]  You take two tablespoons of MediCleanse powder, mix with water or juice, drink, and it does all the work for you.
[02:21:06.718 --> 02:21:07.198]  That's it?
[02:21:07.499 --> 02:21:09.039]  It sounds so easy and convenient.
[02:21:09.240 --> 02:21:09.940]  It is easy.
[02:21:10.140 --> 02:21:16.784]  Plus, the FDA says flaxseed works to prevent cancer and helps with menopause, weight loss, irritable bowel syndrome, and constipation.
[02:21:17.044 --> 02:21:18.385]  It helps with all of those ailments?
[02:21:18.605 --> 02:21:19.385]  That's amazing!
[02:21:19.706 --> 02:21:25.069]  And, the benzenite clay in MediCleanse eliminates viruses and pesticides in the intestinal tract.
[02:21:25.309 --> 02:21:25.629]  Wow!
[02:21:25.809 --> 02:21:26.870]  Where can I buy MediCleanse?

[02:21:52.961 --> 02:21:54.582]  Well, we're honored.
[02:21:54.603 --> 02:21:58.866]  This is the first radio interview Ed Haas has done on this story since he broke it this weekend.
[02:21:59.467 --> 02:22:01.749]  He's been working on it off and on the last few months.
[02:22:01.769 --> 02:22:03.631]  The first got on the trail six months ago.
[02:22:04.031 --> 02:22:07.795]  Okay, so he's in the cemetery behind a wall getting some clippings.
[02:22:07.815 --> 02:22:09.056]  That's where the English ivy grows.
[02:22:09.836 --> 02:22:11.338]  And he hears people in Hebrew.
[02:22:11.358 --> 02:22:12.159]  He gets up closer.
[02:22:12.219 --> 02:22:13.059]  They don't know he's there.
[02:22:13.119 --> 02:22:13.580]  What does he hear?
[02:22:14.830 --> 02:22:30.581]  Yeah, he moves closer, and you're right, they don't know he's here, and he confirms the conversations being spoken in Hebrew, and he overhears, the Americans will learn what it is to live with terrorists after the planes hit the twins in September.
[02:22:31.442 --> 02:22:33.403]  That's his quote.
[02:22:33.603 --> 02:22:35.285]  This is in October of 2000.
[02:22:36.746 --> 02:22:38.026]  He hears this conversation.
[02:22:40.148 --> 02:22:41.549]  So that's many months before 9-11?
[02:22:41.569 --> 02:22:41.749]  11 months.
[02:22:41.769 --> 02:22:42.109]  11 months.
[02:22:46.019 --> 02:22:46.519]  Amazing.
[02:22:47.500 --> 02:22:52.143]  Okay, and did they say anything else after that or did he hear anything else?
[02:22:53.723 --> 02:22:57.626]  He said that actually it was two men leaning against the wall.
[02:22:57.726 --> 02:23:03.429]  He sees a third, they're speaking in Hebrew, he sees a third pull up in a town car.
[02:23:05.096 --> 02:23:18.249]  When the third shows up, that's when they get into the conversation where the quote is, the Americans will learn what it is to live with terrorists after the planes hit the Twin Cities in September.
[02:23:18.389 --> 02:23:26.597]  One of the two men that had been at the meeting before the town car showed up, he had asked the individual in the town car
[02:23:27.433 --> 02:23:38.220]  Uh, expressed some doubts, uh, about whether the upcoming election in November of 2000 between Bush, Cheney, Gore, Lieberman would, could have any impact on their plans.
[02:23:38.320 --> 02:23:42.823]  And the individual on the down card, uh, is quoted as saying, don't worry.
[02:23:42.863 --> 02:23:44.104]  We have people in high places.
[02:23:44.464 --> 02:23:47.346]  No matter who gets elected, they will take care of everything.
[02:23:49.807 --> 02:23:51.168]  This is what the individual heard.
[02:23:52.273 --> 02:23:52.673]  Amazing.
[02:23:52.693 --> 02:23:56.015]  And there was another quote in there about they can't believe how stupid the Arabs are?
[02:23:56.295 --> 02:23:56.756]  That's right.
[02:23:57.156 --> 02:23:57.596]  That's right.
[02:23:57.716 --> 02:23:59.577]  That they don't realize they're being used.
[02:23:59.757 --> 02:24:21.529]  Which is, you know, this individual, the individual who overheard this, you know, as a former Israeli Defense Force member, he, I've spoken to him on numerous different occasions, and he, you know, he definitely has an insight about how intelligence communities work,
[02:24:22.344 --> 02:24:25.785]  How governments work.
[02:24:26.485 --> 02:24:32.087]  He knew that he overheard something that was very, very dangerous.
[02:24:32.808 --> 02:24:36.629]  So you approached him how many months ago and developed a relationship with him?
[02:24:38.710 --> 02:24:42.471]  I probably made my first contact with him about three months ago.
[02:24:42.491 --> 02:24:45.632]  I had received some email information from him.
[02:24:47.653 --> 02:24:50.474]  The first thing, he doesn't write English well.
[02:24:51.657 --> 02:24:54.500]  And he doesn't speak English great.
[02:24:55.080 --> 02:25:08.210]  So I took some time, you know, the truth is when I first got his stuff via email and I read it, I kind of had a hard time understanding it because of his broken English.
[02:25:08.711 --> 02:25:18.859]  Reading his writing, it sounded, you know, uneducated or kind of nutty and I had to kind of work through all that.
[02:25:19.344 --> 02:25:20.265]  In my mind.
[02:25:20.385 --> 02:25:24.607]  When did you get the FBI agent's cards and letters from the Justice Department?
[02:25:25.147 --> 02:25:26.248]  I received that stuff.
[02:25:27.188 --> 02:25:32.211]  I actually got copies of this stuff from the individual a week and a half ago.
[02:25:32.731 --> 02:25:35.712]  These were the pieces of information that he said he had that I
[02:25:37.577 --> 02:25:39.638]  Well, I have to see that stuff.
[02:25:39.719 --> 02:25:42.721]  Okay, so now you get them, and then you start making phone calls.
[02:25:42.761 --> 02:25:45.202]  That's where this gets scary.
[02:25:45.222 --> 02:25:46.843]  Bring us to the next, because I'm looking.
[02:25:46.883 --> 02:25:51.326]  We've got these up on Infowars.com or up on the Mock Record Report.com, right?
[02:25:51.727 --> 02:25:58.872]  Yeah, what made it so fascinating is, I mean, on November 22nd, I decide, okay, I'm going to start trying to confirm this guy's story.
[02:25:58.952 --> 02:26:05.076]  Once I confirmed that the agent existed, I mean, some of this stuff, you know, if you think about somebody making up a story,
[02:26:05.526 --> 02:26:16.195]  You know, identifying FBI agents isn't... You know, it's not like when you go on your local police force website, they'll have pictures of all the police officers.
[02:26:16.255 --> 02:26:23.520]  You know, identity of agents is something that, you know, he would have had to have went to great lengths to fabricate.
[02:26:23.580 --> 02:26:25.642]  So I thought, well, I'm going to confirm the agent.
[02:26:26.883 --> 02:26:32.107]  So I contacted the FBI NORC Division, and I was able to confirm
[02:26:33.718 --> 02:26:40.362]  Agent Gritz, who is one of the agents that the source says met with him on June 26, 2001.
[02:26:42.463 --> 02:26:43.504]  Robin L. Gritz.
[02:26:43.984 --> 02:26:44.925]  Robin L. Gritz.
[02:26:45.665 --> 02:26:51.969]  And I was told by the FBI NORC Division, they transferred me to the legal unit.
[02:26:52.769 --> 02:26:55.651]  And she asked if I could submit a request
[02:26:56.377 --> 02:26:57.658]  In writing, which I did.
[02:26:57.678 --> 02:27:07.805]  I wrote a letter, you know, just basically saying I want to confirm whether Agent Gritz and Agent Stengel met with this individual on June 26, 2001.
[02:27:08.065 --> 02:27:14.450]  This individual says he had overheard a conversation.
[02:27:14.470 --> 02:27:17.732]  You know, I kind of brought him up to date about what I'm trying to do here.
[02:27:17.772 --> 02:27:22.035]  This guy says he overheard something in October 2000, which is pretty compelling.
[02:27:23.940 --> 02:27:27.663]  I faxed the letter to the legal unit saying... Stay there!
[02:27:27.823 --> 02:27:28.543]  We got a break again.
[02:27:28.583 --> 02:27:31.865]  When we come back, we'll tell the rest of the story and then give you some new details, folks.
[02:27:35.347 --> 02:27:36.268]  We're on the march.
[02:27:36.748 --> 02:27:38.349]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.270 --> 02:27:41.952]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[02:28:53.787 --> 02:28:56.189]  Yeah... Honey, is there something wrong?
[02:28:56.549 --> 02:28:59.951]  Yeah, I just realized we forgot to pack the travel berkey system.
[02:29:00.432 --> 02:29:01.913]  I can't drink this cabin water.
[02:29:02.373 --> 02:29:04.074]  And what am I gonna do when I'm out on the lake?
[02:29:04.455 --> 02:29:06.236]  Now the whole vacation is ruined.

[02:29:47.017 --> 02:29:51.142]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass?
[02:29:51.362 --> 02:29:53.124]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[02:29:53.384 --> 02:29:59.691]  If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough, the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[02:29:59.971 --> 02:30:06.098]  Using this similar principle, Royal Raymond Rife discovered that diseased organisms can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[02:30:06.338 --> 02:30:08.180]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument
[02:30:08.320 --> 02:30:08.520]  I think?

[02:31:11.770 --> 02:31:14.411]  Someone who cares.
[02:31:16.152 --> 02:31:21.153]  Your own personal Jesus.
[02:31:24.478 --> 02:31:26.900]  Someone to hear your prayers.
[02:31:27.360 --> 02:31:39.950]  Someone who's there.
[02:31:40.030 --> 02:31:43.493]  Feeling unknown and you're all alone.
[02:31:43.853 --> 02:31:46.916]  Flashing home by the telephone.
[02:31:46.936 --> 02:31:47.817]  Welcome back!
[02:31:47.837 --> 02:31:51.299]  Lift up the receiver, I'll make you a believer.
[02:31:51.319 --> 02:31:53.221]  Glad that you joined us today.
[02:31:54.660 --> 02:31:57.342]  Ed Haas, founder and editor of the Munkweger Report.
[02:31:57.942 --> 02:31:59.023]  Founded in 2002.
[02:31:59.063 --> 02:32:00.945]  We've been watching his work and posting a lot of it.
[02:32:00.985 --> 02:32:01.765]  Done a lot of great work.
[02:32:03.026 --> 02:32:07.009]  Has enjoyed a steady increase in readership over the years, with exponential growth occurring in 2006.
[02:32:07.329 --> 02:32:12.893]  And he is a great writer and done a lot of good journalistic work in this report.
[02:32:12.913 --> 02:32:13.934]  And he's here with us today.
[02:32:13.954 --> 02:32:16.095]  Okay, so you're vetting, you're vetting, you're vetting.
[02:32:16.135 --> 02:32:19.238]  And so you send the letter that legal asked you to at the FBI.
[02:32:20.730 --> 02:32:42.024]  They're in New Jersey to tell you indeed if these two FBI agents met with this unnamed individual who you know now, this Israeli-American who was in the Yom Kippur War, who heard these people talking about in Hebrew in September when the twins get hit, they'll know what it's like to live with terrorism.
[02:32:43.303 --> 02:32:45.985]  And then the ensuing discussion about that.
[02:32:47.025 --> 02:32:47.966]  Please continue.
[02:32:48.006 --> 02:32:49.266]  You're still vetting the story.
[02:32:49.287 --> 02:32:50.127]  Yeah, right.
[02:32:50.167 --> 02:32:56.231]  What's so amazing about it is on Wednesday, November 22nd, I contact FBI NORC Division.
[02:32:56.931 --> 02:33:06.336]  On Friday, November 24th, I receive a phone call from the NORC Division confirming receipt of my letter.
[02:33:07.057 --> 02:33:08.598]  On Tuesday, November 28th,
[02:33:10.040 --> 02:33:13.891]  I receive a phone call from Kathy at FBI National Press Office.
[02:33:14.727 --> 02:33:20.669]  So, it jumped from North Division Legal Unit to FBI Press Office National.
[02:33:20.869 --> 02:33:25.330]  Oh yeah, they're not ignoring this like it was just some crazy that they talked to a year ago.
[02:33:25.350 --> 02:33:27.071]  No, no, this is serious.
[02:33:27.411 --> 02:33:27.691]  Right.
[02:33:28.091 --> 02:33:34.233]  She said, Kathy informs me... So a six-plus year old case is being taken very serious.
[02:33:34.653 --> 02:33:34.913]  Right.
[02:33:35.693 --> 02:33:42.815]  She says I have to file a Freedom of Information Act request and I let her know what I thought of that because, I mean, that's a joke.
[02:33:44.217 --> 02:33:50.541]  So, on Wednesday, November 29th, this was the piece that made me say I'm writing this story.
[02:33:51.482 --> 02:34:01.169]  The day later, I call directly to Agent Robin Gritz, who allegedly met with the source on June 26, 2001, who left her business card.
[02:34:05.622 --> 02:34:13.567]  With him, at the meeting, who he had copies of, he kept the business cards, made me copies, which you have in your hand.
[02:34:14.247 --> 02:34:18.989]  I get her on the phone, I introduce myself, and immediately explain.
[02:34:19.790 --> 02:34:25.813]  When I talk to these folks at home, see all around, I said, I'm trying to confirm this meeting that you had.
[02:34:26.634 --> 02:34:33.437]  She immediately, immediately said, I believe the press office is handling this for you.
[02:34:33.838 --> 02:34:34.558]  She was aware.
[02:34:35.478 --> 02:34:38.700]  So this agent who... They've been having meetings about this.
[02:34:38.760 --> 02:34:39.780]  This is big medicine.
[02:34:40.281 --> 02:34:40.501]  Right.
[02:34:40.581 --> 02:34:41.641]  She was aware.
[02:34:41.661 --> 02:34:46.684]  I said, look, I just want to confirm the meeting.
[02:34:47.164 --> 02:34:48.985]  I decided to call you directly.
[02:34:49.126 --> 02:34:53.528]  And she said to me, I am not allowed to discuss this with you.
[02:34:53.548 --> 02:34:55.389]  I would get in trouble.
[02:34:56.272 --> 02:35:06.660]  And that right there, where there's smoke, there's fire, if they just said that this case is inconsequential, or no I did not meet with him, or, no, no, no, she said I would get in trouble.
[02:35:06.700 --> 02:35:08.201]  What was her tone like when she said that?
[02:35:09.262 --> 02:35:12.464]  She was very, you know, she wasn't rude or anything like that.
[02:35:12.544 --> 02:35:13.965]  She was like, I will get in trouble.
[02:35:14.325 --> 02:35:15.666]  I'm not allowed to talk to people.
[02:35:15.686 --> 02:35:17.668]  Did she say that with any passion?
[02:35:17.708 --> 02:35:18.629]  Like, I will get in trouble!
[02:35:18.649 --> 02:35:20.710]  I mean, was she emotional or was it just real dry?
[02:35:20.730 --> 02:35:23.292]  No, it wasn't very dry, in fact.
[02:35:25.960 --> 02:35:34.403]  If I recall, she might have even had somewhat of a laugh in the tone, kind of like, what are you, crazy?
[02:35:35.464 --> 02:35:36.604]  I'm not telling you anything.
[02:35:36.624 --> 02:35:46.868]  Well, you know, if she was in Texas or 42 other states, you could have recorded her, but you can't in the District of Columbia or in Maryland or Connecticut, so you couldn't record her.
[02:35:47.008 --> 02:35:49.089]  But it'd be nice to have a recording of that.
[02:35:49.801 --> 02:35:56.084]  Right, I mean, and I tried to explain to them, look, this isn't really about the FBI, and it really isn't about any more evidence.
[02:35:56.224 --> 02:35:57.645]  Yeah, did you meet with this guy?
[02:35:57.705 --> 02:35:58.726]  He says he met with you.
[02:35:58.766 --> 02:36:03.448]  He's given us your cards with handwritten notes on them.
[02:36:03.468 --> 02:36:04.909]  You ought to have that.
[02:36:05.929 --> 02:36:08.010]  I got a copy of her handwriting.
[02:36:08.591 --> 02:36:18.356]  And then more, we have letters here from the Justice Department to this unnamed
[02:36:20.191 --> 02:36:25.895]  Is he an Israeli living in America, or is he a Jewish American who was originally in Israel?
[02:36:25.915 --> 02:36:26.495]  Is he a citizen?
[02:36:27.676 --> 02:36:37.803]  I don't know his citizen status right now, but I believe at one time his citizen status, he was here, not as a citizen.
[02:36:38.023 --> 02:36:40.945]  I believe he's an Israeli living in America.
[02:36:41.245 --> 02:36:42.005]  This is the thing.
[02:36:42.106 --> 02:36:43.987]  He was asking for protection.
[02:36:44.147 --> 02:36:45.168]  He got the information.
[02:36:45.248 --> 02:36:46.008]  Oh yeah, that's the key.
[02:36:46.589 --> 02:36:47.149]  Go over that.
[02:36:48.153 --> 02:36:55.298]  These two letters that he received, he initially contacted the FBI.
[02:36:55.338 --> 02:37:01.842]  They told him, if you have any information, take it to your local NORC division, because he's in New Jersey.
[02:37:03.003 --> 02:37:05.604]  That's how he ended up in contact with those folks.
[02:37:06.405 --> 02:37:13.749]  He contacted them, and I have the dates in the article, and they said, we'll send some agents out to you.
[02:37:13.809 --> 02:37:14.650]  They never came.
[02:37:16.210 --> 02:37:25.793]  So he wrote back to the FBI, and he said, look, I have some compelling information I want to share with you, but I need protection.
[02:37:26.793 --> 02:37:40.717]  And, you know, I'm thinking, okay, you know, this guy, IDF, you know, has some inner workings of knowing how things really go down behind the scenes in government.
[02:37:40.857 --> 02:37:43.418]  His request for protection, I thought, was prudent.
[02:37:44.453 --> 02:38:01.664]  And he was asking for that guarantee, and so he has two letters that he provided me that basically, they are coming from Arthur Radford Baker, Unit Chief, Office of Public and Congressional Affairs, the FBI, saying, you know, we can't guarantee you anything.
[02:38:02.445 --> 02:38:11.971]  In his letter he said, if you're still concerned about your safety and believe that your local police are unable to help you, you may report your concerns to the New Jersey State Police.
[02:38:12.551 --> 02:38:13.552]  This guy's worried about
[02:38:14.130 --> 02:38:19.917]  The Mossad, you know, and the FBI is telling him, call your local cops!
[02:38:23.612 --> 02:38:25.073]  This really is powerful evidence.
[02:38:25.133 --> 02:38:27.794]  Not just the phone call you made to the agent and she said I'd get in trouble.
[02:38:28.235 --> 02:38:31.416]  You have the letters where he was seeking protection.
[02:38:31.436 --> 02:38:34.518]  You've now made those available to the world.
[02:38:34.538 --> 02:38:40.220]  And they say any concerns you have for your safety should be brought to the attention of your local or state law enforcement authorities.
[02:38:40.521 --> 02:38:44.823]  Since the FBI does not have the legal authority to provide you personal protection.
[02:38:45.843 --> 02:38:56.098]  This is the cooperation and support of citizens like you are essential to the FBI in carrying out its investigative responsibilities, and we are grateful for your offer to help in the fight against terrorism.
[02:38:56.279 --> 02:38:58.081]  Again, this is dated before 9-11, March 28, 2001.
[02:39:01.145 --> 02:39:16.158]  If you become aware of information which you believe would be of investigative interest to the FBI, you may wish to contact our Newark office at the address below, since that office is responsible for overseeing FBI operations in your area.
[02:39:16.478 --> 02:39:22.543]  The next letter, there's another letter here, this time from June 20th, now we're getting up within a few months of the attacks.
[02:39:23.023 --> 02:39:23.243]  Right.
[02:39:23.684 --> 02:39:29.088]  And he received, what's interesting is the June 20th letter, he received on June 26th,
[02:39:30.310 --> 02:39:34.734]  The day that Agent Gritz and Stengel allegedly came to see him.
[02:39:35.334 --> 02:39:38.577]  They come to see him, he presents them with these letters.
[02:39:39.237 --> 02:39:41.980]  And says, look, I got some information.
[02:39:42.360 --> 02:39:46.764]  I can't tell you the details unless you can guarantee me protection.
[02:39:46.804 --> 02:39:56.632]  He describes Agent Gritz and Stengel as being kind of outraged by this rejection of any
[02:39:57.304 --> 02:40:01.026]  protection for this individual coming from the higher echelon to the FBI.
[02:40:01.046 --> 02:40:08.989]  And we know that again from Texas to Phoenix, Arizona to Chicago, Illinois to Minneapolis, St.
[02:40:09.009 --> 02:40:19.494]  Paul, Minnesota all over the country FBI agents weren't allowed or blocked from investigating all these red flags that were popping up.
[02:40:20.495 --> 02:40:22.135]  But he didn't stop there, did he?
[02:40:22.956 --> 02:40:24.797]  Well, what happened was they
[02:40:26.058 --> 02:40:34.440]  First thing is, he spoke highly of those two agents, and he said that they spent two to three hours with him, and they tried to gain the information.
[02:40:34.880 --> 02:40:46.903]  He said, look, what I can tell you, I can't tell you everything, but I will tell you, the information I have involves a terror strike in New York City, and it involves airplanes.
[02:40:47.583 --> 02:40:51.544]  If you want more information, I need to guarantee your protection.
[02:40:53.034 --> 02:40:57.089]  He didn't tell them what he heard in that cemetery.
[02:40:57.310 --> 02:40:58.474]  Now let's be clear here.
[02:40:59.750 --> 02:41:02.511]  We know that other people made warnings.
[02:41:02.591 --> 02:41:06.692]  Flight school chiefs said, look, these guys don't want to know how to land.
[02:41:06.712 --> 02:41:09.252]  FBI agents are take off.
[02:41:09.412 --> 02:41:13.613]  FBI agents said in reports they may want to fly planes into the World Trade Center.
[02:41:13.913 --> 02:41:18.535]  This was out in the few months before 9-11 because they were getting it from so many different sectors.
[02:41:19.095 --> 02:41:20.635]  I've gotten so much chatter on it.
[02:41:20.735 --> 02:41:24.496]  I went on TV and said they'll probably attack the World Trade Centers and blame it on Bin Laden.
[02:41:25.323 --> 02:41:31.211]  I mean, old Alex Jones, folks, was getting the shatter and hearing big events about to happen.
[02:41:31.271 --> 02:41:33.634]  Where have they hit before, Alex, is what my sources were saying.
[02:41:33.875 --> 02:41:34.916]  Well, I knew where they hit before.
[02:41:34.956 --> 02:41:39.642]  The FBI took the bomb, trained the driver in New York in 1993 with the first attack.
[02:41:40.403 --> 02:41:43.324]  And then you have Odigo, the Israeli instant message company.
[02:41:43.844 --> 02:41:46.145]  That's mainstream Israeli news, folks, where it comes from.
[02:41:46.625 --> 02:41:49.606]  Admitting, yeah, we got a call, told our people to not go to work or get out of the building.
[02:41:50.106 --> 02:41:53.987]  You have the Arab kids on record saying that those buildings won't be there next week.
[02:41:54.228 --> 02:41:55.888]  You have printed calendars showing it.
[02:41:55.908 --> 02:41:58.629]  I mean, everybody knew that this was going on.
[02:41:58.649 --> 02:42:02.050]  Now, any other tidbits that have come out since you wrote this over the weekend?
[02:42:02.710 --> 02:42:04.871]  Any other little developments that people need to know about?
[02:42:06.229 --> 02:42:12.851]  Well, what I'm working on right now is I'm going to do the Freedom of Information Act request, just for the formality of it.
[02:42:14.031 --> 02:42:17.952]  I'm going to try to get this individual to come public.
[02:42:18.712 --> 02:42:27.534]  What's interesting is that after the event, after 9-11, nobody from the FBI came back to this guy.
[02:42:28.394 --> 02:42:30.055]  Nobody came back to him to say,
[02:42:31.397 --> 02:42:32.558]  Maybe we missed something.
[02:42:32.998 --> 02:42:34.300]  Can you tell us what you knew?
[02:42:35.641 --> 02:42:41.088]  Which in his mind just confirms that this thing, you know,
[02:42:43.203 --> 02:42:44.963]  Isn't the way the government told us.
[02:42:45.043 --> 02:42:48.984]  When you talk to him from what he heard and what he's seen, who does he think did the attacks?
[02:42:49.004 --> 02:42:50.865]  I mean, does this show Israeli support?
[02:42:50.985 --> 02:42:52.405]  Israeli total involvement?
[02:42:52.785 --> 02:42:54.105]  Or, I mean, to him, what did that mean?
[02:42:54.125 --> 02:43:00.447]  And that weird thing, you know, that cryptic statement about, you know, the Arabs don't know that we're using them, that they're being set up, you know, they're so stupid.
[02:43:00.467 --> 02:43:01.267]  What was the exact quote?
[02:43:03.388 --> 02:43:04.128]  Uh, let me see.
[02:43:04.648 --> 02:43:09.849]  But yeah, that they don't realize that they're being used, that they're so stupid.
[02:43:10.815 --> 02:43:29.933]  I think this, based on what I've gained from this individual, you know, he definitely believes that it was a, you know, maybe not just Israeli intelligence, but like you said at the beginning of the show, you know, it's a conglomeration of intelligence agencies that come together.
[02:43:30.813 --> 02:43:33.296]  Israelis obviously knew about it.
[02:43:34.236 --> 02:43:36.779]  He thinks that there is a relationship between
[02:43:37.347 --> 02:43:52.710]  What he heard and being in Newark area and the urban moving system story, the five Israelis that were... Yeah, how close to all of that right across the water is the cemetery?
[02:43:54.252 --> 02:43:56.254]  I didn't do exact distances yet.
[02:43:56.634 --> 02:44:02.279]  I looked at, from New York to the cemetery, it was 13 miles.
[02:44:03.420 --> 02:44:04.421]  So it's right there?
[02:44:04.861 --> 02:44:09.105]  Yeah, I mean it's pretty feasible that... And Newark is only about 12 miles.
[02:44:10.506 --> 02:44:10.806]  Right.
[02:44:11.387 --> 02:44:16.111]  And the, you know... Well I guess the outskirts are, because I've been on trains there.
[02:44:17.091 --> 02:44:38.148]  One of the quotes at the end of the article is that, you know, they talk about, I go back to the urban moving systems and one of the employees who's on record from the system saying, you know, he's in tears on the morning of 9-11 and his Israeli co-workers are laughing and joking.
[02:44:38.878 --> 02:44:49.007]  And he's on record, this former Urban Moving Systems employee, is saying, you know, one of the Israelis said, you know, now you know what it's like to live with terrorism.
[02:44:49.547 --> 02:45:00.036]  And I thought, well, that's a... When I found that quote, and tying it in with what this individual said he overheard in October of 2000, I said, well, that's striking.
[02:45:00.498 --> 02:45:04.101]  You know, to get America to understand what it's like.
[02:45:04.241 --> 02:45:05.623]  You might go dig this up.
[02:45:05.723 --> 02:45:13.710]  The bizarre Bergen County police chief, they have a police chief in the county there, who I had on, what, two years ago, who said we should all be made to take tips.
[02:45:13.730 --> 02:45:14.090]  Remember that?
[02:45:14.110 --> 02:45:14.931]  I don't know if you ever saw that.
[02:45:15.552 --> 02:45:18.835]  I didn't even know, and then one of my people ran and said, do you know that's the same county?
[02:45:18.875 --> 02:45:24.860]  He's the guy that arrested the van full of the O'Reilly's for jumping up and down, and I brought that up and he didn't want to talk about it.
[02:45:25.646 --> 02:45:26.006]  Really?
[02:45:26.346 --> 02:45:27.567]  Yeah, he said, yeah, it was weird.
[02:45:27.587 --> 02:45:28.447]  Yeah, we did arrest him.
[02:45:28.467 --> 02:45:29.567]  Yeah, they were celebrating.
[02:45:30.207 --> 02:45:31.208]  Yeah, this did happen.
[02:45:31.248 --> 02:45:32.728]  And then boy, they all moved out of there.
[02:45:33.328 --> 02:45:35.289]  They all moved out of there real, real quick.
[02:45:35.329 --> 02:45:38.110]  And that ties in with the camera and the jumping up and down.
[02:45:38.150 --> 02:45:40.370]  I tell you, this story turns out, we know he contacted them.
[02:45:40.410 --> 02:45:43.111]  We know they admit that these letters were sent.
[02:45:43.151 --> 02:45:44.191]  They won't say about what.
[02:45:44.891 --> 02:45:45.832]  We know from his side.
[02:45:47.412 --> 02:45:48.753]  Yeah, there's a rule in this.
[02:45:48.793 --> 02:45:52.435]  If you've told your story and you've gone public and you're out in the open, they normally won't kill you.
[02:45:52.455 --> 02:45:53.476]  It makes you a lot safer.
[02:45:54.016 --> 02:45:56.618]  Because, you know, dead men tell no tales.
[02:45:56.638 --> 02:46:01.441]  But once you put your story out, a dead man becomes a martyr and truly certifies.
[02:46:02.418 --> 02:46:03.699]  And that's the story.
[02:46:03.919 --> 02:46:04.940]  And I talked to you.
[02:46:04.980 --> 02:46:14.306]  You said he knows he's in great danger and that he was approached out of the blue with someone that, you know, he's all secretive about this, who was bringing this up to him last week.
[02:46:14.386 --> 02:46:22.911]  And that was before there was even a story, meaning that your phone calls to the FBI had already spurred something, obviously, back into the intelligence apparatchik.
[02:46:22.931 --> 02:46:23.552]  Tell us about that.
[02:46:24.437 --> 02:46:42.724]  Well, we had a conversation maybe an hour and a half long, maybe a week and a half ago, and then I called him two days later because I had a follow-up question that I needed to get an answer to, and he had said that between those two conversations,
[02:46:43.277 --> 02:47:04.627]  That he was approached by an individual in his neighborhood who he never saw before, well-dressed, well-spoken, and very friendly, and this individual comes up to him and starts talking to him, you know, about specific information that isn't the type of information you would bring up in a conversation you meet with a stranger on the street.
[02:47:05.047 --> 02:47:11.330]  He felt convinced that, you know, he said in a very matter-of-fact way, our conversations are being listened to.
[02:47:12.972 --> 02:47:15.895]  Which, you know, he lives with that.
[02:47:17.156 --> 02:47:20.119]  You know, one of the pieces, Alex, is what Senator Graham
[02:47:22.303 --> 02:47:23.184]  Stay there, stay there.
[02:47:23.244 --> 02:47:24.564]  Final segment with Ed Haas.
[02:47:24.604 --> 02:47:26.425]  Let's talk about it when we get back.
[02:47:26.745 --> 02:47:28.686]  Folks, stay with us in fullwars.com.
[02:47:29.347 --> 02:47:34.449]  We took a little bacon and we took a little beans and we caught the bloody British in a town in New Orleans.
[02:47:34.769 --> 02:47:37.270]  We fired our guns and the British kept a-coming.
[02:47:37.490 --> 02:47:39.932]  There wasn't as many as there was a while ago.
[02:47:39.972 --> 02:47:42.673]  We fired once more and they began to run it.
[02:47:42.953 --> 02:47:45.174]  On down to Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico.
[02:47:48.095 --> 02:48:09.662]  We looked down a river and we seen the British come And there must have been a hundred of them beatin' on the drums They stepped so high and they made their bugles ring We stood beside our cotton bales and didn't say a thing Oh, we fired our guns and the British kept a-comin' There wasn't as many as there was a while ago We fired once more and they began to runnin' On down to Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico
[02:48:12.597 --> 02:48:15.240]  Old Hickory said we could take them by surprise.
[02:48:15.320 --> 02:48:17.962]  If we didn't fire muskies, still we looked them in the eye.
[02:48:18.203 --> 02:48:20.665]  We held our fire till we see their faces well.
[02:48:20.705 --> 02:48:23.748]  Then we opened up our swirl guns and really gave them well.
[02:48:23.828 --> 02:48:27.111]  We fired our guns and the breeze kept a coming.
[02:48:27.131 --> 02:48:29.594]  There wasn't as many as there was a while ago.
[02:48:29.854 --> 02:48:32.496]  We fired once more and they began to run it.
[02:48:32.536 --> 02:48:34.799]  From down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico.
[02:48:41.505 --> 02:48:53.729]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:48:54.089 --> 02:49:01.712]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:49:02.426 --> 02:49:09.490]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:49:09.870 --> 02:49:21.317]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:49:21.617 --> 02:49:25.099]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:49:25.579 --> 02:49:27.500]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:49:27.841 --> 02:49:31.623]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:51:57.600 --> 02:52:00.282]  We fired our cannon till the barrel melted down.
[02:52:00.322 --> 02:52:03.043]  So we grabbed an alligator and we fought another round.
[02:52:03.244 --> 02:52:05.845]  We filled his head with cannonballs and powdered his behind.
[02:52:05.865 --> 02:52:08.487]  And when we touched the powder off the gator lost his mind.
[02:52:08.527 --> 02:52:11.409]  We fired our guns and the British kept a coming.
[02:52:11.429 --> 02:52:13.870]  There wasn't as many as there was a while ago.
[02:52:14.130 --> 02:52:16.832]  We fired once more and they began to run it.
[02:52:16.852 --> 02:52:19.133]  From down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico.
[02:52:21.955 --> 02:52:27.399]  Yeah, they ran through the briars and they ran through the brambles and they ran through the bushes where rabbits couldn't go.
[02:52:27.679 --> 02:52:30.341]  They ran so fast that the hounds couldn't catch them.
[02:52:30.482 --> 02:52:32.443]  Down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico.
[02:52:43.360 --> 02:52:43.941]  Welcome back.
[02:52:43.961 --> 02:52:45.482]  A final segment here with Ed Haas.
[02:52:45.502 --> 02:52:49.164]  We've got to get him back up later this week and we're working on getting the individual.
[02:52:49.224 --> 02:52:49.945]  He knows his name.
[02:52:50.005 --> 02:52:50.565]  He's interviewed him.
[02:52:50.605 --> 02:52:51.145]  He's talked to him.
[02:52:51.186 --> 02:52:51.706]  He's vetted it.
[02:52:52.333 --> 02:52:53.153]  It's really scary.
[02:52:53.213 --> 02:52:55.514]  I hope that it turns out to be some elaborate hoax.
[02:52:55.614 --> 02:52:57.615]  Even if it is, it's some government office credit.
[02:52:58.035 --> 02:52:59.576]  And it doesn't look like that at this time.
[02:52:59.636 --> 02:53:04.358]  It fits in with all the same M.O., the prior knowledge, everybody locally hearing about it.
[02:53:04.618 --> 02:53:06.538]  This is somebody, this is where those stories started.
[02:53:06.879 --> 02:53:10.680]  Somebody like this, locally, who actually overheard the source of it.
[02:53:11.700 --> 02:53:15.442]  In the last four minutes we've got left, any other key areas we haven't covered at Haas?
[02:53:16.082 --> 02:53:22.285]  Well, I think one of the most intriguing things is quotes from Senator Graham from Florida.
[02:53:23.065 --> 02:53:38.711]  In intelligence reports, and his quotes were printed in some magazines, he said, I think there is very compelling evidence that at least some of the terrorists were assisted, not just in financing, although that was part of it, by a sovereign government.
[02:53:39.171 --> 02:53:45.514]  It will become public at some point when it's turned over to the archives, but that's 20 or 30 years from now.
[02:53:46.227 --> 02:53:49.513]  And, you know, as an American citizen, I don't like that.
[02:53:49.914 --> 02:53:56.766]  If that information shouldn't be held from the public, I want to know who that sovereign government
[02:53:57.279 --> 02:53:59.520]  Well, I agree.
[02:53:59.540 --> 02:54:01.661]  This individual Ed Haas obviously isn't stupid.
[02:54:01.681 --> 02:54:02.241]  He has to know.
[02:54:02.301 --> 02:54:03.782]  Now you've contacted the FBI.
[02:54:04.042 --> 02:54:05.222]  They've had high-level meetings.
[02:54:06.023 --> 02:54:07.523]  You've gotten calls.
[02:54:07.623 --> 02:54:09.144]  All this stuff is going on.
[02:54:09.544 --> 02:54:10.864]  He needs to go public.
[02:54:10.884 --> 02:54:12.925]  I'll be here in the studio.
[02:54:12.965 --> 02:54:15.686]  We can do a taped interview with you and he whenever you want.
[02:54:15.746 --> 02:54:16.847]  I'd rather do it live.
[02:54:17.407 --> 02:54:18.547]  We need to stay in contact.
[02:54:18.567 --> 02:54:20.288]  When the show ends, I'll give you my cell phone number.
[02:54:20.628 --> 02:54:21.908]  We need to get him on the air.
[02:54:21.928 --> 02:54:24.529]  I need to talk to him today, tomorrow, at the latest.
[02:54:24.969 --> 02:54:27.070]  We need to get him out in public.
[02:54:27.610 --> 02:54:30.411]  And, I mean, that will protect him to a much greater extent.
[02:54:30.431 --> 02:54:35.132]  That's what every analyst, every person who's been in covert ops has told us is what history shows.
[02:54:35.452 --> 02:54:40.454]  I mean, he's got to understand that now he's gone public, he better make a big splash and do it now.
[02:54:40.994 --> 02:54:46.737]  Yeah, and I'm going to contact him tonight, and I'm going to give him your contact information, and we're going to see if we can get this done.
[02:54:47.177 --> 02:54:47.998]  I'm concerned for him.
[02:54:49.038 --> 02:54:51.300]  Well, he's got to know it's dangerous now that you wrote the article.
[02:54:51.320 --> 02:54:52.320]  I mean, what does he think of the story?
[02:54:52.780 --> 02:54:53.161]  He does.
[02:54:53.921 --> 02:54:54.941]  He does know it's dangerous.
[02:54:57.043 --> 02:55:00.805]  And so this was somebody that knew him locally that contacted you, and that's how it happened?
[02:55:01.625 --> 02:55:09.149]  Actually, yeah, a friend of his is a reader of the Muckraker Report, and she had emailed me saying, I really need you to talk to this individual.
[02:55:09.654 --> 02:55:11.075]  And that's how the whole thing started.
[02:55:11.215 --> 02:55:12.976]  Well, that's what's great about the alternative media.
[02:55:13.136 --> 02:55:15.137]  I can't follow every story I hear about.
[02:55:15.217 --> 02:55:16.277]  I can't call every lead.
[02:55:16.638 --> 02:55:17.178]  You can't.
[02:55:17.258 --> 02:55:24.702]  But with thousands of alternative sites and reporters and people out there, we're really giving the globalists a run for their money.
[02:55:25.162 --> 02:55:27.683]  Are you concerned, Ed, because this is pretty dangerous what you're doing?
[02:55:29.044 --> 02:55:29.644]  I don't care.
[02:55:31.065 --> 02:55:31.765]  I really don't.
[02:55:31.785 --> 02:55:34.146]  I mean, truth is truth.
[02:55:34.206 --> 02:55:35.167]  Live free or die?
[02:55:36.656 --> 02:55:37.578]  That's me, baby.
[02:55:37.679 --> 02:55:40.645]  I mean, the truth is the truth, and I'm not going to lie.
[02:55:40.846 --> 02:55:41.126]  I agree.
[02:55:41.146 --> 02:55:42.931]  You were in more danger, though, before you got the job.
[02:55:43.812 --> 02:55:47.335]  Man, when you were calling the FBI last week and having all these conversations... Yep.
[02:55:47.835 --> 02:55:49.176]  This is serious business.
[02:55:49.256 --> 02:55:52.219]  Alright, well I'll talk to you when we end here in about 45 seconds.
[02:55:52.799 --> 02:55:54.421]  Ed Haas, anything else you want to add?
[02:55:54.441 --> 02:55:57.843]  No, just thanks so much for getting this story out, Alex.
