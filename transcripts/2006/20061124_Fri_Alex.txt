[00:00:05.602 --> 00:00:06.242]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.903 --> 00:00:07.964]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.664 --> 00:00:09.785]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.446 --> 00:00:11.247]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.007 --> 00:00:12.888]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.908 --> 00:00:17.272]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.753 --> 00:00:21.876]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:22.036 --> 00:00:26.480]  They'll be taking a lot of calls in this hour, at least I'll attempt it.
[00:00:27.441 --> 00:00:29.203]  A ton of news I haven't even gotten to yet.
[00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.680]  Bush was in Vietnam and said, you know what I learned from Vietnam?
[00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:34.460]  Not to quit.
[00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:36.001]  Talk about spin.
[00:00:36.061 --> 00:00:37.761]  He said, you guys didn't quit.
[00:00:37.821 --> 00:00:38.401]  You won.
[00:00:39.282 --> 00:00:40.622]  We're not going to quit in Iraq.
[00:00:40.662 --> 00:00:41.702]  And the Democrats agreed.
[00:00:41.722 --> 00:00:44.383]  20,000 more troops on their way.
[00:00:46.044 --> 00:00:47.644]  You vote in the Democrats to get out of the war.
[00:00:47.664 --> 00:00:49.165]  And they say, you know what?
[00:00:49.245 --> 00:00:50.425]  We're going to get out of the war.
[00:00:50.465 --> 00:00:52.086]  But first, we're going to increase the troops.
[00:00:53.846 --> 00:00:57.507]  Oh, you don't want to have all the toll roads, all the roads handed over to foreign companies.
[00:00:57.567 --> 00:00:58.528]  Well, we'll just do it.
[00:01:00.502 --> 00:01:03.704]  Oh, you don't like getting tasered over and over again when you can't even get up off the ground.
[00:01:03.725 --> 00:01:05.206]  How about we just taser you some more?
[00:01:07.827 --> 00:01:11.510]  Let's go ahead and talk to Crispin in New Orleans.
[00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:12.211]  You're on the air.
[00:01:12.271 --> 00:01:12.591]  Welcome.
[00:01:13.251 --> 00:01:13.652]  Thank you.
[00:01:13.712 --> 00:01:14.252]  Hey, Alex.
[00:01:14.292 --> 00:01:14.853]  How you doing?
[00:01:14.993 --> 00:01:15.533]  Pretty good, sir.
[00:01:16.194 --> 00:01:19.116]  Hey, I wanted to call and thank you and thank your staff.
[00:01:19.176 --> 00:01:21.718]  You played an important role in helping me wake up.
[00:01:23.079 --> 00:01:26.461]  I first started looking into FEMA's actions after the hurricane.
[00:01:26.521 --> 00:01:27.602]  I'm from New Orleans here.
[00:01:28.602 --> 00:01:31.766]  And, uh, doing so, I came across your road to tyranny.
[00:01:32.807 --> 00:01:36.791]  And, uh, you just... I can't believe how much you've helped me wake up.
[00:01:37.151 --> 00:01:41.276]  And I've been trying to speak the truth to people that I know here in town.
[00:01:41.809 --> 00:01:48.712]  And the main thing I'm confronted with is their inability to believe that the government is competent enough to do these kind of things.
[00:01:49.192 --> 00:01:51.953]  Well, that's one of the most common things we hear.
[00:01:52.433 --> 00:01:59.075]  The bureaucracy is designed to be kind of a jello-like quicksand at the lower levels.
[00:01:59.996 --> 00:02:04.497]  But I assure you, the payoffs and the money deliveries are carried out with total precision.
[00:02:05.338 --> 00:02:07.439]  And there is a lot of incompetence in New Orleans.
[00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:11.120]  I'm not knocking the people there, but it is known as the real Sin City.
[00:02:12.436 --> 00:02:20.326]  It's been a pirate town, really the oldest city in the country, and so what do you expect?
[00:02:20.726 --> 00:02:29.017]  So there is a lot of local incompetence, but I assure you there's not incompetence on the CPS's grabbing people's kids that's scientifically executed.
[00:02:29.577 --> 00:02:32.598]  There's not incompetence when they put the fluoride in your water.
[00:02:33.098 --> 00:02:38.719]  There's not incompetence when they have people totally poor, so they've got to join the military to serve the empire.
[00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:48.780]  All of this, you know, the bureaucracy... See, the government's also meant to fall apart, so then they can say, oh, let us privatize it, see?
[00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.141]  There's a lot of different reasons for all of this.
[00:02:51.201 --> 00:02:52.241]  It's very sophisticated.
[00:02:53.361 --> 00:02:58.802]  Well, I just want to let you know also what a great tool TerrorStorm has been
[00:02:59.355 --> 00:03:02.896]  And I appreciate very much that you allow us to copy and distribute your movie.
[00:03:02.916 --> 00:03:03.737]  I don't allow you to.
[00:03:03.837 --> 00:03:04.657]  I want you to.
[00:03:05.077 --> 00:03:05.857]  I ask you to.
[00:03:06.438 --> 00:03:07.738]  Well, I certainly have been.
[00:03:08.038 --> 00:03:11.519]  Unfortunately enough, I work at a coffee shop, which is a cultural hub.
[00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:18.682]  We have district attorneys, lawyers, police officers, firemen, businessmen, service industry workers.
[00:03:19.202 --> 00:03:26.945]  Everybody walks in this coffee shop, and my boss allows me a space on the counter where I have been burning your movie and a few others.
[00:03:27.575 --> 00:03:31.358]  And just leaving them with a note that says, free movie, DVD, five stars.
[00:03:31.918 --> 00:03:35.640]  And I cannot seem to burn them fast enough, regardless of the packaging.
[00:03:36.641 --> 00:03:39.063]  Are the police officers picking them up?
[00:03:39.943 --> 00:03:40.503]  Yes, sir.
[00:03:40.804 --> 00:03:41.964]  That's the psychology.
[00:03:42.525 --> 00:03:43.025]  It's important.
[00:03:43.065 --> 00:03:43.605]  It's important.
[00:03:43.625 --> 00:03:43.966]  Take it.
[00:03:44.166 --> 00:03:44.706]  They won't take it.
[00:03:44.726 --> 00:03:46.387]  They'll just go, hey, free film.
[00:03:47.148 --> 00:03:48.048]  Or just leave them out.
[00:03:48.108 --> 00:03:48.889]  That's the way to do it.
[00:03:49.389 --> 00:03:51.030]  And it's regardless of the packaging.
[00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:55.233]  I mean, I'm putting handwritten on there, Alex Jones's Terror Storm and History of
[00:03:55.612 --> 00:03:58.113]  Government-sponsored terrorists are like, oh wow, what's this?
[00:03:58.133 --> 00:03:58.774]  And they grab it.
[00:03:59.374 --> 00:04:03.576]  Uh, just the other day I gave a copy of your movie to the city attorney here in New Orleans.
[00:04:03.936 --> 00:04:04.456]  Good job.
[00:04:04.476 --> 00:04:05.357]  Well, what you ought to do...
[00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:17.527]  Uh, and I tell you, that's who really wakes up to my films, is people who are in power positions, because they've actually been on the inside, not normally high enough to be doing something really evil, but then everything makes sense.
[00:04:17.928 --> 00:04:29.455]  How many special forces commanders, how many generals, how many congressmen and women have I talked to privately, or heads of hospitals, or you name it, who say, nothing made sense till I saw your films.
[00:04:29.596 --> 00:04:36.220]  Now, what I did in Korea, what I did in Nam, what I did in South, you know, what I did in the U.S., what I did in Latin America,
[00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:37.620]  Now I understand.
[00:04:38.321 --> 00:04:39.181]  Because it's the truth.
[00:04:40.021 --> 00:04:43.023]  And the truth shines through the darkness every time.
[00:04:43.483 --> 00:04:46.704]  And hey, I don't care if you guys, if you start getting, if you have the money, give them out free.
[00:04:46.724 --> 00:04:48.765]  If you don't, sell them for a dollar.
[00:04:49.465 --> 00:04:50.365]  Get your money back.
[00:04:51.046 --> 00:04:52.366]  Alright, we'll be right back.
[00:04:52.906 --> 00:04:54.107]  Fighting the New World Order.
[00:04:54.127 --> 00:04:54.607]  Stay with us.
[00:05:04.295 --> 00:05:07.498]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[00:05:07.838 --> 00:05:09.780]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:17.806]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:05:18.486 --> 00:05:25.552]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:05:25.932 --> 00:05:32.818]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying,
[00:05:33.314 --> 00:05:37.356]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:05:37.657 --> 00:05:41.179]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:05:41.639 --> 00:05:43.540]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:47.803]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:06:01.064 --> 00:06:01.825]  Terrorism!
[00:06:01.985 --> 00:06:02.725]  Terrorism!
[00:06:02.825 --> 00:06:08.910]  Chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallout, biological attack, anthrax, and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic!
[00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:10.751]  Alarming words for our time!
[00:06:10.991 --> 00:06:13.473]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[00:06:13.853 --> 00:06:28.423]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:06:28.463 --> 00:06:28.784]  government.
[00:06:28.964 --> 00:06:30.745]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[00:06:31.125 --> 00:06:37.048]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[00:06:37.168 --> 00:06:41.691]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video Sheltering in Place.
[00:06:41.931 --> 00:06:47.293]  Get the critical information you need now for only $29 plus shipping by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:06:47.413 --> 00:06:48.654]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:06:48.714 --> 00:06:49.234]  That's 888-803-4438.

[00:07:00.905 --> 00:07:05.547]  According to the American Diabetes Association, more than 18 million people in the U.S.
[00:07:05.587 --> 00:07:06.308]  have diabetes.
[00:07:06.648 --> 00:07:13.591]  Most people with diabetes have risk factors such as obesity, high blood pressure, and cholesterol, which increase their risk for heart disease.
[00:07:13.732 --> 00:07:18.274]  For example, more than 65% of people with diabetes die from heart disease or stroke.
[00:07:18.474 --> 00:07:21.295]  Finding out you or your loved ones have diabetes can be scary.

[00:08:06.427 --> 00:08:08.710]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:10.469 --> 00:08:10.809]  We're good to go.
[00:08:39.207 --> 00:08:41.188]  Well, welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:08:41.368 --> 00:08:42.769]  I am glad that you have joined us.
[00:08:42.789 --> 00:08:48.151]  We're scheduled to have Michael Kaufman there, but the network's getting us contact info right now.
[00:08:48.171 --> 00:08:59.556]  And then we've got a city council member, actually a mayor pro tem, coming on from one of these cities and saying, look, we're not going to have illegal aliens here.
[00:08:59.736 --> 00:09:01.537]  Illegal is in the word.
[00:09:03.438 --> 00:09:07.900]  And it's causing the anti-American forces to go absolutely ape and assail them.
[00:09:08.678 --> 00:09:13.081]  So he's going to be joining us briefly in the third hour today.
[00:09:16.704 --> 00:09:26.392]  But before we go to Dr. Michael Kaufman, who I hope is still there when we try to contact him, let's go ahead and talk to Pat in Rhode Island.
[00:09:26.432 --> 00:09:27.492]  Pat, you're on the air.
[00:09:27.532 --> 00:09:27.993]  Go ahead.
[00:09:28.273 --> 00:09:29.134]  I'm from Rhode Island.
[00:09:29.174 --> 00:09:32.056]  I want to let you know first, Alex, I'm a graduate of the University of Notre Dame.
[00:09:32.356 --> 00:09:34.578]  I've got an electrical engineering degree from there.
[00:09:34.978 --> 00:09:36.379]  I'm also a graduate of St.
[00:09:36.439 --> 00:09:37.260]  Anselm College.
[00:09:37.884 --> 00:09:39.525]  New Hampshire with a liberal arts degree.
[00:09:39.545 --> 00:09:41.827]  So both sides of my brain work very well.
[00:09:42.707 --> 00:09:45.850]  First of all, thank you for the investment you've made in all matters.
[00:09:45.950 --> 00:09:47.791]  And I know it goes back before 9-11.
[00:09:48.972 --> 00:09:49.412]  Amazing.
[00:09:49.452 --> 00:09:50.653]  I put you on the front lines.
[00:09:50.693 --> 00:09:51.374]  You are the chief.
[00:09:51.834 --> 00:09:54.035]  You are the general of this movement.
[00:09:54.156 --> 00:09:56.577]  You know, everybody's been saying that.
[00:09:56.597 --> 00:09:58.238]  Now it's getting really bad all over the country.
[00:09:59.591 --> 00:10:06.133]  All professors call up and call me the commander, and it really needs to stop, folks, because it's a good way to get me killed real fast.
[00:10:06.673 --> 00:10:10.834]  I am not the general, I am not the leader, I am just, I am one person in the fight.
[00:10:10.914 --> 00:10:16.136]  You, all of you out there are your own leaders in this fight, but thank you sir.
[00:10:16.276 --> 00:10:18.216]  Okay, let me come to the front lines right now with you.
[00:10:18.836 --> 00:10:28.179]  Nothing is going to change, Alex, unless the people who know what the truth is realize the fact that the truth being pointed out alone is not going to change anything
[00:10:28.689 --> 00:10:34.070]  When is this movement going to become a movement of action and not just a movement of preaching to the choir?
[00:10:34.270 --> 00:10:35.250]  I'm asking you, Alex.
[00:10:35.651 --> 00:10:41.152]  We need this rocket, okay, to move from the first stage to the second stage.
[00:10:41.232 --> 00:10:51.154]  Now, I've talked to Eric Humschmid, who you probably know was probably the first American citizen to put together, other than yourself, to put together a collection
[00:10:51.716 --> 00:10:54.057]  of pertinent relevance on video.
[00:10:54.077 --> 00:11:00.060]  Yeah, actually his first film cited my film and I don't care who's the first to do something but then there's claims.
[00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:17.929]  Okay, I'm just saying that there are people who have been talking about this for years, okay, and I want to know, and I talked to him personally on the phone, I want to know when the change is going to be to civil disobedience and to real action because how else, how else, and again, remember I'm a graduate of the University of Notre Dame, I'm not this
[00:11:18.413 --> 00:11:21.540]  Guy that's looking to, like, go into battle on any issue.
[00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:23.323]  How else are things going to change, Alex?
[00:11:23.363 --> 00:11:27.292]  I do not believe that if the American people, just by being informed of the truth...
[00:11:27.938 --> 00:11:32.981]  I do not believe that is going to organically, somehow, just change the direction of things.
[00:11:33.221 --> 00:11:35.363]  So, I want to ask you, are you willing to die?
[00:11:35.383 --> 00:11:36.483]  Are you willing to go to jail?
[00:11:36.503 --> 00:11:47.951]  Are you willing... Well, I've been to jail several times over this stuff, so... And I've been physically attacked, and I've gone through a lot of things I don't talk about on air because I don't do the enemy's job for them, intimidating people.
[00:11:48.451 --> 00:11:51.853]  Some of this stuff would scare people, but people can probably imagine.
[00:11:52.454 --> 00:11:53.014]  Number one,
[00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:59.382]  A lot of the folks calling for some violent clash or civil disobedience, they're not the people out there doing it.
[00:11:59.402 --> 00:12:00.302]  They're telling us to do it.
[00:12:00.322 --> 00:12:02.923]  Every day, and I'm about to go to Dr. Munkle-Kaufman, but your question's important.
[00:12:03.243 --> 00:12:04.243]  Let me just go over it with you.
[00:12:05.224 --> 00:12:08.044]  We are not done in the education phase.
[00:12:08.085 --> 00:12:22.029]  For a full decade, and that was with serious folks that would go to war quick, it took a decade plus and committees of correspondence to get the colonies mad enough to go to war with the British.
[00:12:23.175 --> 00:12:23.616]  Okay.
[00:12:24.236 --> 00:12:26.138]  And let them pull a couple more Waco's.
[00:12:26.178 --> 00:12:27.880]  Let them keep going down this line.
[00:12:28.461 --> 00:12:31.123]  Believe me, our strength is only going to continue to increase.
[00:12:31.143 --> 00:12:36.649]  That's why they're trying to pump in as many illegals as they can and give them special deals on buying houses.
[00:12:37.310 --> 00:12:39.872]  The big banks were in the AP two days ago.
[00:12:39.912 --> 00:12:40.573]  I saw the article.
[00:12:40.593 --> 00:12:41.714]  I heard Jack McClam talking about it.
[00:12:41.734 --> 00:12:42.435]  I went and pulled it up.
[00:12:43.356 --> 00:12:45.178]  They're, quote, trying to root them here.
[00:12:46.542 --> 00:12:48.322]  To, quote, stop the move to kick them out.
[00:12:48.663 --> 00:12:50.683]  I mean, they're doing everything they can to kill this country.
[00:12:50.963 --> 00:12:56.365]  Handing over the infrastructure, grabbing all the land, you know, putting us in... and you're about to hear about this from a real expert.
[00:12:57.765 --> 00:12:59.905]  So, we need to continue.
[00:12:59.965 --> 00:13:01.666]  The general public is not informed.
[00:13:01.686 --> 00:13:03.406]  The general public does not know the truth yet.
[00:13:03.706 --> 00:13:05.227]  They're starting to wake up.
[00:13:05.747 --> 00:13:13.509]  The government goes out and carries out terror attacks at OKC and other places just to create the illusion that we're violent.
[00:13:14.375 --> 00:13:16.896]  So they can try to use force to suppress us.
[00:13:17.216 --> 00:13:27.600]  It's not going to do anything to go out and burn down some buildings, have shootouts with dumbed down police in their little Darth Vader outfits.
[00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:29.521]  That doesn't hurt the New World Order.
[00:13:30.061 --> 00:13:31.541]  I'm going to expose David Rockefeller.
[00:13:31.782 --> 00:13:34.743]  I'm making a film about the Bilderberg.
[00:13:34.883 --> 00:13:38.444]  I'm going at the heart of the pyramid here, the eye of the capstone.
[00:13:39.144 --> 00:13:42.185]  And so it's a process, but I do go out and demonstrate.
[00:13:42.746 --> 00:13:43.386]  I tell people
[00:13:44.318 --> 00:13:47.581]  Stand up in restaurants and start yelling that 9-11 is an inside job.
[00:13:48.021 --> 00:13:49.822]  I tell people to make copies of my films.
[00:13:50.263 --> 00:13:52.725]  I tell you not to take the vaccinations for your children.
[00:13:53.025 --> 00:13:54.186]  Take them out of public school.
[00:13:54.226 --> 00:13:54.626]  You know what?
[00:13:54.646 --> 00:14:01.612]  I heard a talk show host this week, last week, and say that the greatest example of liberty and people coming out of Babylon
[00:14:02.282 --> 00:14:04.504]  Coming out of Rome are the homeschoolers.
[00:14:04.904 --> 00:14:07.045]  It was a few hundred thousand just a couple years ago.
[00:14:07.105 --> 00:14:08.506]  Now it's over two and a half million.
[00:14:08.726 --> 00:14:09.867]  There's a huge exodus.
[00:14:10.127 --> 00:14:13.249]  They're trying to ban it now in Illinois and California.
[00:14:13.609 --> 00:14:14.590]  Parents should say no!
[00:14:15.431 --> 00:14:15.791]  Okay?
[00:14:16.972 --> 00:14:18.473]  They're trying all this stuff.
[00:14:18.973 --> 00:14:20.934]  Stop spending your money on the establishment.
[00:14:21.835 --> 00:14:22.675]  Don't support them.
[00:14:23.876 --> 00:14:25.117]  Start your own organizations.
[00:14:25.157 --> 00:14:26.518]  I mean, what would you like us to do?
[00:14:29.065 --> 00:14:29.806]  Yes, you're still there.
[00:14:29.826 --> 00:14:30.686]  What would you like me to do?
[00:14:30.867 --> 00:14:32.928]  Okay, Mike, I'm going to just make a prediction right now.
[00:14:32.968 --> 00:14:54.746]  I mean, I appreciate you giving some historical context to the matter and going back to the revolutionary days, but the bottom line is that the kind of weaponry and the kind of capabilities that our government has right now to reap destruction, and I'm not talking about planned destruction, I'm talking about kind of like, okay, the government getting together with some of their people and saying, you know, in the next three days we need to make something happen.
[00:14:55.870 --> 00:15:10.454]  My point is this, if we don't make something happen, if we don't do something unexpected as a movement, I mean, if we don't have the cajongas to do what they have the cajongas to do... Well, I think at this point, I mean, people parachuting into football stadiums with huge banners out behind them.
[00:15:10.654 --> 00:15:11.675]  I'm not saying do that.
[00:15:12.035 --> 00:15:13.975]  You know, spray painting government buildings.
[00:15:13.995 --> 00:15:15.476]  I mean, it is an emergency.
[00:15:16.301 --> 00:15:22.065]  situation and people need to non-violently stand up however they can, but I'm not saying do that.
[00:15:22.085 --> 00:15:23.185]  I'm using that as an example.
[00:15:23.546 --> 00:15:28.769]  Somebody will parachute in naked just for attention, but they won't parachute in for their country.
[00:15:28.789 --> 00:15:34.132]  I tell you, when you get the silver bullet, you call up and you tell me what it is.
[00:15:34.313 --> 00:15:34.833]  I know this.
[00:15:35.073 --> 00:15:38.655]  I, like a woodpecker, have stayed focused on fighting the New World Order.
[00:15:39.096 --> 00:15:44.419]  When I learned about this 15 years ago, when I got on air 12 years ago, I had a mission to fight the New World Order.
[00:15:45.225 --> 00:15:53.171]  And to not just sit around and strategize and talk about big grand plans, just to educate people, take action, tell people to stand up, do the right thing.
[00:15:53.752 --> 00:15:59.676]  I have enough confidence in the native intelligence of the people to form a unified resistance.
[00:15:59.736 --> 00:16:05.681]  Listen, they were putting thumb scanners in to get school lunches and face scanners eight years ago.
[00:16:05.821 --> 00:16:08.003]  Now, in California, in London,
[00:16:08.613 --> 00:16:13.256]  You know, in Sacramento, in London, parents are saying no, and they're having to remove the thumb scanners.
[00:16:13.676 --> 00:16:16.317]  People are saying no to RFID chips around the kids' necks.
[00:16:16.677 --> 00:16:18.659]  You know, the people now are getting mad.
[00:16:18.719 --> 00:16:19.519]  I've got to let you go.
[00:16:19.539 --> 00:16:24.522]  We somehow got our wires crossed, and my producer was out.
[00:16:24.562 --> 00:16:25.722]  We didn't get the number to the network.
[00:16:25.762 --> 00:16:32.746]  I apologize that Dr. Kaufman has been holding for about five minutes, but I'm really honored to have him with us.
[00:16:32.766 --> 00:16:33.867]  I haven't interviewed him in years.
[00:16:34.557 --> 00:16:39.260]  We've only got about 45 minutes with him now, but I've got to get him up for two hours in the future.
[00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:41.802]  I am carrying his new video.
[00:16:41.922 --> 00:16:50.688]  It's absolutely amazing and powerful and something Christians need to have, but just Americans, period, need to have.
[00:16:50.748 --> 00:16:53.230]  His bio is too lengthy to ever even go through.
[00:16:53.250 --> 00:16:56.492]  I want him in a nutshell to basically tell you who he is.
[00:16:57.811 --> 00:17:07.422]  He of course put the maps together with the government documents and information he had of where over 90% of the country will be restricted, over half of it total restriction of human use.
[00:17:07.842 --> 00:17:16.753]  The corridors he put together in the mid-90s are now exactly where they're announcing their corridors now, where they're saying they're going to shut off human use.
[00:17:17.433 --> 00:17:19.034]  Everything he's saying is happening.
[00:17:19.955 --> 00:17:23.978]  He has done an incredible job on the North American Union, on all of it.
[00:17:24.619 --> 00:17:27.861]  And Dr. Michael Kaufman, a professor, thank you for coming on.
[00:17:27.941 --> 00:17:33.365]  Tell us about yourself, who you are, the work you've done, in a nutshell.
[00:17:34.166 --> 00:17:34.926]  Well, thank you, Alex.
[00:17:35.727 --> 00:17:37.308]  It is a pleasure to be back on with you.
[00:17:37.328 --> 00:17:41.111]  It has been about a year and a half, two years, I think, since we talked to each other.
[00:17:41.761 --> 00:17:47.249]  But nonetheless, I have a PhD in Ecosystems Analysis, actually in Environmental Sciences.
[00:17:47.830 --> 00:17:56.182]  But yet, when I began to see, I was leading a multi-million dollar research effort back in the 1980s, and I began to realize that the environmental leadership and the
[00:17:57.029 --> 00:18:01.251]  Many of our government agencies were not interested in protecting the environment.
[00:18:01.291 --> 00:18:06.294]  They were interested in gaining control, which pricked my interest into finding out exactly why.
[00:18:06.314 --> 00:18:12.898]  And I entered this whole battle scene in the late 1980s investigating what in the world was going on with the environmental movement.
[00:18:13.342 --> 00:18:21.286]  Well, it doesn't take long before you start connecting the dots, and it goes right back up to the global agenda, the Rockefellers, the Trilateral Commissions, and so forth.
[00:18:21.466 --> 00:18:23.587]  Population reduction.
[00:18:24.388 --> 00:18:25.868]  What is the grand plan?
[00:18:25.968 --> 00:18:26.889]  People get confused here.
[00:18:27.329 --> 00:18:31.311]  Real environmentalism, conservation, is important and is real.
[00:18:31.591 --> 00:18:37.394]  The people running it, though, are the ones dumping the chemicals in the ocean, making the genetically engineered crops.
[00:18:37.454 --> 00:18:38.875]  They're the ones actually hurting the earth.
[00:18:39.355 --> 00:18:40.656]  Well, their basic goal is to do two things.
[00:18:41.016 --> 00:18:43.877]  One is to create a world religion, which they're doing through environmentalism.
[00:18:43.937 --> 00:18:45.698]  It's basically the idea that the Earth is gone.
[00:19:07.952 --> 00:19:11.653]  You've heard of the so-called Gaia Hypothesis and so forth.
[00:19:11.693 --> 00:19:14.734]  And this is official UN treaties, laws, they say this.
[00:19:15.394 --> 00:19:15.714]  Yes.
[00:19:15.874 --> 00:19:36.581]  In fact, we came within just a few hours in 2002 of the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg of having a New Earth Ethic, which we'll let them call it, but it's really a New Earth Religion instilled as a guiding ethic for the United Nations for every single person on planet Earth.
[00:19:37.150 --> 00:19:42.476]  Christian, non-Christian, you name it, would have to ascribe to if they wanted to be sanctioned by the government.
[00:19:43.137 --> 00:19:52.247]  We came within a couple hours of having that thing actually accepted by the United Nations, and we finally got the State Department to pull the language out of the consensus document.
[00:19:52.267 --> 00:19:52.908]  Well, stay there.
[00:19:52.988 --> 00:19:53.309]  Stay there.
[00:19:53.329 --> 00:19:54.250]  We've got a break, Doctor.
[00:19:54.590 --> 00:19:56.192]  When we come back, we'll get right to it.
[00:19:56.452 --> 00:19:56.933]  Stay with us.
[00:20:01.175 --> 00:20:02.155]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[00:20:02.235 --> 00:20:07.017]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve Note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[00:20:07.177 --> 00:20:14.980]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:20.622]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[00:20:20.822 --> 00:20:27.804]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[00:20:28.104 --> 00:20:33.446]  A current effort is underway by the Fed along with other central banks to increase liquidity for depositors.
[00:20:33.686 --> 00:20:38.428]  However, an increase in money supply without equal expansion and productivity can cause inflation.
[00:20:38.768 --> 00:20:46.392]  In order to achieve strength and stability, I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver.
[00:20:46.712 --> 00:20:49.393]  While paper investments currently have been driven by debt,
[00:20:49.853 --> 00:20:52.956]  Gold, on its own, has held value for over 6,000 years.
[00:20:53.276 --> 00:20:54.897]  For more information, call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:20:56.198 --> 00:20:57.700]  That's 1-800-686-2237.

[00:21:04.345 --> 00:21:18.377]  Did you know that there's a secret group that has been trying to destroy all ordered government, eliminate private property, abolish inheritance, rid the nation of patriotism and the family, abolish religion and establish a world government?

[00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:05.461]  Do you know the truth about breast cancer?
[00:23:05.962 --> 00:23:08.344]  Do you realize that the race for the cure is over?
[00:23:09.153 --> 00:23:17.577]  The best-kept secret in the world today is that now it's possible to kill cancer without personal suffering, mutilation, and poisoning of your entire system.

[00:23:40.092 --> 00:23:41.353]  That's www.LazMedInc.com.
[00:24:26.578 --> 00:24:35.451]  Welcome back.
[00:24:37.814 --> 00:24:38.555]  Glad that you joined us.
[00:24:38.575 --> 00:24:41.099]  Dr. Michael Kaufman will be with us in about five minutes in the next hour.
[00:24:41.119 --> 00:24:41.540]  Then I've got a
[00:24:43.724 --> 00:24:49.949]  Dallas-Fort Worth Area Mayor coming on to talk about the illegal alien problem and what we're dealing with there, all part of the Global Plan.
[00:24:50.589 --> 00:24:54.512]  Dr. Michael Kaufman, again, you've been studying this for decades now.
[00:24:54.613 --> 00:24:55.934]  You've made quite a few films.
[00:24:56.274 --> 00:25:09.324]  We're carrying your newest, which is just an amazing, World Events and Prophecy, because this really reaches out to Christians, which I count myself among, from a biblical perspective, but then showing the documents, and it does fit hand in glove.
[00:25:09.644 --> 00:25:13.167]  The elite really do, at the end of the day, worship Lucifer.
[00:25:13.912 --> 00:25:16.053]  And for atheists out there, they just can't get that.
[00:25:16.334 --> 00:25:18.515]  That the elite do believe in God and the devil.
[00:25:18.555 --> 00:25:21.697]  They just think the devil is God, but I'm kind of putting a cart before the horse.
[00:25:22.237 --> 00:25:24.018]  How are they using the environmental movement?
[00:25:24.118 --> 00:25:26.920]  What will life be like in America under this system?
[00:25:26.940 --> 00:25:27.601]  Will they continue?
[00:25:28.501 --> 00:25:42.750]  Well, you know, one of the things that really we were fighting for back in 2002 was to keep this from becoming the United Nations religion that would then be forced down on every person in every nation because right on its heels was a brand new treaty
[00:25:43.436 --> 00:25:54.942]  That what it was called, the Covenant on Environment and Development, that would have put this into legal teeth, that you would have been forced to, at the point of a gun, to adhere to these very principles of Pantheism, that the Earth is God.
[00:25:55.142 --> 00:26:07.309]  And it's the very same stuff we see in Europe, where if a ten-year-old girl is in a study group with a bunch of foreigners who can't speak English, and she says, I want to be in a different group, they arrest her and put her in a jail cell, saying it was hateful.
[00:26:08.129 --> 00:26:09.630]  Yes, absolutely, same thing.
[00:26:10.391 --> 00:26:11.172]  I don't think so.
[00:26:29.727 --> 00:26:34.769]  The freedom of making a choice of how you use your property, be it a house or your land or even money.
[00:26:34.829 --> 00:26:35.730]  Money is property too.
[00:26:35.750 --> 00:26:43.674]  You're not going to be allowed to do that because everything is spelled out and everything is designed to protect Mother Earth, who they believe is God.
[00:26:44.174 --> 00:26:50.997]  They believe that we've been basically destroying Mother Earth or God with all the modern conveniences and so forth.
[00:26:51.017 --> 00:26:55.159]  We're not sustainable in their eyes and we would go back a hundred years in our technology
[00:26:55.868 --> 00:26:59.152]  If this ever got into actual principle and into effect.
[00:26:59.172 --> 00:27:01.494]  And that's the key word there is sustainability.
[00:27:02.355 --> 00:27:05.078]  That's their excuse to grab property to control populations.
[00:27:05.098 --> 00:27:10.003]  And again, in their real actions, the very global corporations funding this, they're doing the opposite.
[00:27:10.043 --> 00:27:11.965]  They're the ones that are really hurting the earth.
[00:27:13.050 --> 00:27:13.590]  Absolutely.
[00:27:13.690 --> 00:27:15.551]  You know, that's the ironic thing about this.
[00:27:15.731 --> 00:27:27.496]  It's the major international or transnational corporations and the financial institutes, the major banks of the world and so forth, and I explain all this in the DVD, that are actually doing the damage.
[00:27:27.576 --> 00:27:30.798]  They could care less about the environment.
[00:27:30.838 --> 00:27:33.139]  And they could care less about homosexuals either.
[00:27:33.179 --> 00:27:36.000]  They just make it all sound loving and liberal.
[00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:40.662]  Oh, you're going to all be sweet to each other, or the men in black uniforms will come and arrest you.
[00:27:41.505 --> 00:27:43.187]  Yeah, and that is very true.
[00:27:43.207 --> 00:27:49.074]  And the only way they can gain control is to impose this religion, because religion is the one thing that will unite people.
[00:27:49.595 --> 00:27:50.916]  And they're trying to impose this.
[00:27:50.936 --> 00:27:56.163]  They have been now for 30 years or more, and trying to impose it so that everybody is in favor of
[00:27:56.621 --> 00:27:57.222]  We're good to go.
[00:28:12.802 --> 00:28:19.530]  Which then gets us to hand away our own sovereignty and control and start thinking and group thinking.
[00:28:19.771 --> 00:28:32.326]  All the TV shows, all the children's shows, the propaganda is everywhere that humans are bad and the state's going to punish those bad humans and keep them in line, but that's really just other humans who are going to be having the control.
[00:28:33.126 --> 00:28:33.586]  That's right.
[00:28:34.107 --> 00:28:41.053]  Which brings up the second point, the second goal that they have, is that they want total control, they want to have a world government.
[00:28:41.413 --> 00:28:49.299]  It's probably going to be administered through the United Nations, but the United Nations, as evil as it will be, will not be the people that are pulling the strings on it.
[00:28:49.399 --> 00:28:53.463]  They will be the international financiers and so forth, the global elite.
[00:28:55.504 --> 00:28:56.725]  No, you're absolutely right.
[00:28:58.067 --> 00:29:05.254]  I found out that Dutch Royal Shell 10 years ago, and BBC broke this, put out the peak oil fraud.
[00:29:05.754 --> 00:29:13.482]  I mean, when you open up National Geographic that's total anti-human, when you open it up, the whole thing is financed by Dutch Shell.
[00:29:13.502 --> 00:29:14.823]  They must have five ads.
[00:29:15.864 --> 00:29:16.525]  It's sick!
[00:29:17.286 --> 00:29:17.846]  It really is.
[00:29:18.247 --> 00:29:19.208]  It's an amazing thing.
[00:29:20.024 --> 00:29:22.086]  They call it the public-private partnerships.
[00:29:22.126 --> 00:29:23.547]  I don't get that into this DVD.
[00:29:23.627 --> 00:29:25.388]  I do in other DVDs that I've done.
[00:29:25.868 --> 00:29:33.513]  But these public-private partnerships basically put industry, these international corporations, in charge of government.
[00:29:34.054 --> 00:29:35.215]  I do discuss this.
[00:29:35.515 --> 00:29:38.537]  You know, Carol Quigley, you've probably talked about him many times.
[00:29:39.051 --> 00:29:42.854]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism, but globalism.
[00:30:15.776 --> 00:30:16.096]  We're good.
[00:30:30.796 --> 00:30:31.096]  Thank you.
[00:31:02.734 --> 00:31:03.775]  The War on Terrorism.
[00:31:04.095 --> 00:31:06.876]  Will it be fought overseas, or will it affect us here at home?
[00:31:07.156 --> 00:31:11.299]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[00:31:11.739 --> 00:31:12.559]  So what do you do?
[00:31:12.879 --> 00:31:17.482]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[00:31:17.942 --> 00:31:20.063]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[00:31:20.563 --> 00:31:21.404]  Sheltering in place.
[00:31:21.860 --> 00:31:35.251]  Surviving Acts of Terrorism from Biological, Chemical, and Radioactive Fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:31:35.291 --> 00:31:42.437]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[00:31:42.717 --> 00:31:45.880]  Get this critical video every American needs for only $29 plus shipping.

[00:32:00.899 --> 00:32:04.482]  Are you looking for a one-stop shop to find all your favorite books and videos?
[00:32:04.742 --> 00:32:05.602]  Look no further!
[00:32:05.903 --> 00:32:08.484]  Northern Voice Bookstore has everything you need.
[00:32:08.905 --> 00:32:17.431]  Hundreds of titles, from self-defense, survival, and financial freedom, to history, politics, conspiracy, and everything you need to know about the New World Order.

[00:32:19.312 --> 00:32:19.952]  I think so.
[00:32:35.177 --> 00:32:35.557]  I think.
[00:33:06.913 --> 00:33:16.576]  I've seen one of his other films online years ago, but this one is really important.
[00:33:16.596 --> 00:33:17.276]  You need to have it.
[00:33:18.817 --> 00:33:22.178]  It's World Events and Prophecy DVD.
[00:33:23.018 --> 00:33:24.458]  One world government, one world religion.
[00:33:24.998 --> 00:33:26.819]  The Ten Nation Confederacy of Daniel.
[00:33:27.882 --> 00:33:35.545]  The Mark of the Beast, a scholar of geo-politics and prophecy, Dr. Kaufman, has an opportunity to witness things that are kept from the general public.
[00:33:35.965 --> 00:33:43.187]  Few people are aware that there are five major power factions in the world fighting among themselves over who will dominate the emerging world government.
[00:33:43.227 --> 00:33:46.048]  Yeah, they all support the world government while fighting with each other.
[00:33:46.088 --> 00:33:46.948]  That's the key.
[00:33:47.388 --> 00:33:52.390]  Just like Mafia, Dons, and the Godfather, which is a true story, all meet once a year, but the rest of the year they're fighting.
[00:33:52.970 --> 00:33:55.651]  Or that a world religion came within hours of being accepted.
[00:33:56.999 --> 00:33:59.261]  The world is being divided into 10 economic units.
[00:33:59.301 --> 00:34:06.566]  Americans are only now becoming aware that our government is rapidly becoming a North American Union with Canada and Mexico patterned after the European Union.
[00:34:06.646 --> 00:34:10.269]  Finally, the technology now exists to create a mark of the beast of Revelation 13.
[00:34:10.309 --> 00:34:16.873]  Dr. Coffin explains these world events and the occult meaning of 666 in this DVD.
[00:34:17.414 --> 00:34:18.975]  This is perfect for churches.
[00:34:19.867 --> 00:34:26.691]  I mean, you might try to take a terror storm into your local Baptist church, and the preacher would probably watch it, have a heart attack, and not let you play it.
[00:34:27.191 --> 00:34:28.672]  This you can show in Sunday school.
[00:34:29.272 --> 00:34:30.633]  This you can show at your church.
[00:34:31.253 --> 00:34:36.896]  This is very well done, very calmly done, all documented, and then he parallels it.
[00:34:37.136 --> 00:34:40.478]  It's very effective, and I've done my homework on this.
[00:34:40.858 --> 00:34:44.200]  It's extremely accurate.
[00:34:44.220 --> 00:34:49.103]  $18.95, available at InfoWars.com right now.
[00:34:49.978 --> 00:34:51.319]  Or PrisonPlanet.com.

[00:34:53.879 --> 00:34:59.221]  I don't think I've registered it yet with my operators, but later today you'll be able to also get it by calling 888-253-3139.
[00:34:59.522 --> 00:35:04.523]  I haven't put that in the product code yet for them.
[00:35:05.364 --> 00:35:08.885]  But you can go to InfoWars.com and get it right now or call 888-253-3139.
[00:35:12.714 --> 00:35:18.156]  We're going to go back to Dr. Michael Kaufman, and then we're going to go to Bion in Vietnam, who's from Vietnam, holding.
[00:35:18.216 --> 00:35:20.857]  We get calls all over the world now with his IP over phone.
[00:35:21.797 --> 00:35:23.117]  Voice over IP, whatever you call it.
[00:35:23.798 --> 00:35:30.039]  And Nick, Jeff, NWO, everybody that's patiently holding, we're going to get to you.
[00:35:31.040 --> 00:35:35.541]  But TerrorStorm went to number 17 and went higher than that a few weeks ago.
[00:35:36.221 --> 00:35:39.643]  And it sat there for many hours, more than 10 hours.
[00:35:39.683 --> 00:35:41.003]  I quit watching it for 10 hours.
[00:35:42.392 --> 00:35:44.172]  And now it's settled back to thirty-something.
[00:35:44.212 --> 00:35:50.093]  But again, thank you for driving it now two-plus weeks that it's been in the top hundred or higher.
[00:35:51.254 --> 00:35:52.134]  It's three weeks, really.
[00:35:53.194 --> 00:35:58.095]  And it's at Amazon.com for twelve dollars and some change.
[00:35:58.875 --> 00:36:01.335]  And it's the most powerful film I've ever made.
[00:36:01.375 --> 00:36:03.036]  The history of government-sponsored terror.
[00:36:03.436 --> 00:36:05.236]  How they control the quote radical groups.
[00:36:05.796 --> 00:36:07.076]  How they light us into war.
[00:36:07.517 --> 00:36:08.777]  The police state they're setting up.
[00:36:08.817 --> 00:36:09.857]  The torture of children.
[00:36:10.848 --> 00:36:12.589]  And then it's got 68 minutes of extras.
[00:36:12.850 --> 00:36:14.271]  The film's almost two hours long.
[00:36:14.291 --> 00:36:19.775]  And then it's got 68 minutes of extras on the same DVD.
[00:36:20.776 --> 00:36:21.136]  Okay?
[00:36:21.917 --> 00:36:24.279]  So again, it's such an important film.
[00:36:24.319 --> 00:36:25.219]  Please get Terror Storm.
[00:36:25.480 --> 00:36:27.061]  Or get it from InfoWars.com.

[00:36:31.474 --> 00:36:36.218]  Credible film on the private Federal Reserve and the IRS and what they're doing and the North American Union.
[00:36:36.358 --> 00:36:37.939]  Very important film for $19.95.
[00:36:38.840 --> 00:36:40.441]  And get Terror Storm with it for $9.95.
[00:36:40.962 --> 00:36:44.464]  If you want anybody have Terror Storm, you can't beat that deal, $9.95.
[00:36:44.604 --> 00:36:46.826]  It's an even better deal than Amazon.

[00:36:48.407 --> 00:36:51.970]  You know, get freedom to fascism for yourself and get Terror Storm and give it as a gift.
[00:36:52.010 --> 00:36:52.811]  The gift of knowledge.
[00:36:53.191 --> 00:36:56.374]  Again, InfoWars.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:37:00.937 --> 00:37:08.580]  We're going to be going to your calls here in a little while, but again, I hope you will call or I hope you will go to the website and get the World Events and Prophecy.
[00:37:09.120 --> 00:37:15.043]  Dr. Michael Coffin, please continue with basically what the grand plan is.
[00:37:15.063 --> 00:37:15.863]  This is all written out.
[00:37:16.343 --> 00:37:20.565]  What will life be like if they're able to get this program in place?
[00:37:21.586 --> 00:37:23.787]  Well, basically, it means a controlled society.
[00:37:24.168 --> 00:37:28.170]  You're allowed to make certain decisions by yourself, but everything else is controlled.
[00:37:28.210 --> 00:37:35.094]  You can only make those decisions within very narrowly defined limits as to what you can do and not do.
[00:37:35.254 --> 00:37:45.900]  In fact, this is actually part of... Brzezinski basically said this 30 years ago, that there will become a time when we finally get to that point where we
[00:37:46.550 --> 00:37:48.252]  I think you've really got it nailed on the head there, Alex.
[00:38:02.239 --> 00:38:07.361]  We have to understand that they're going to use a lot of pseudonyms to describe this as something wonderful.
[00:38:07.901 --> 00:38:17.025]  In fact, the whole idea of this environmental lockstep that they're talking about is supposed to be a wonderful life to have this freedom of nature and so forth.
[00:38:17.492 --> 00:38:26.354]  Well in fact it means abject poverty because we can't do anything to benefit mankind if it causes nature some sort of problem.
[00:38:26.374 --> 00:38:30.935]  Well there's nothing that we can do that doesn't impact nature somewhat in a negative way.
[00:38:31.035 --> 00:38:37.517]  But let's look at the microscopic view here locally in Austin.
[00:38:38.394 --> 00:38:42.576]  Ninety-eight, they grabbed 15,000 acres in one land grab for a decade before.
[00:38:42.616 --> 00:38:44.497]  They wouldn't let people build on their own property.
[00:38:44.857 --> 00:38:47.798]  That drove down the value by 90 plus percent in most areas.
[00:38:48.158 --> 00:39:07.146]  Then they made a deal to pay the people about five cents on the dollar for their property and swore that the huge, you know, multi-hundred million dollar buy in southwest Travis County in a key, beautiful area to build, very valuable real estate, that there'd be this huge park
[00:39:07.706 --> 00:39:08.226]  They took it.
[00:39:08.507 --> 00:39:09.988]  There is no park being built.
[00:39:10.028 --> 00:39:13.670]  It was then given to select Fortune 500 management companies.
[00:39:14.030 --> 00:39:19.654]  Nature Conservancy Sierra Club are now building huge developments all over it.
[00:39:19.934 --> 00:39:27.199]  They grabbed land in East Austin and built a five-star golf course, spa, and luxury retreat.
[00:39:27.839 --> 00:39:30.961]  And so really, it's about stealing property.
[00:39:31.738 --> 00:39:32.018]  It is.
[00:39:32.158 --> 00:39:49.286]  In fact, if you look at the whole Smart Growth agenda, and I do have another DVD on Smart Growth that I'll be sending you so you can look at it, but the whole Smart Growth agenda is designed to take property away from the individual and put it into this never-never land that they can eventually use themselves.
[00:39:49.406 --> 00:39:56.810]  In fact, the Wildlands Project, which was part of the Convention on Biological Diversity that we stopped back in 1994 from being ratified in the U.S.
[00:39:56.850 --> 00:39:57.110]  Senate,
[00:39:57.702 --> 00:40:01.124]  That would set aside one half of the United States in the wilderness areas.
[00:40:01.504 --> 00:40:02.384]  What's the purpose of this?
[00:40:02.404 --> 00:40:05.786]  Well, it's supposed to be protecting biodiversity, but they don't care about biodiversity.
[00:40:06.106 --> 00:40:12.068]  They want to lock that land up, one, as collateral on the national debt that you were just talking about.
[00:40:12.088 --> 00:40:16.690]  And I had Joseph Stiklitz, Chief Economist, World Bank, Nobel Prize winner, on three weeks ago.
[00:40:16.730 --> 00:40:18.091]  He said exactly what you just said.
[00:40:18.909 --> 00:40:19.449]  Absolutely!
[00:40:19.750 --> 00:40:21.311]  That is exactly what they're trying to do.
[00:40:21.731 --> 00:40:26.594]  And once they have it, then they will start to develop that land through its resources and so forth.
[00:40:26.894 --> 00:40:28.935]  The money will go in their pockets, not ours.
[00:40:29.195 --> 00:40:31.316]  Well, I've got the video somewhere from 1998.
[00:40:31.436 --> 00:40:35.439]  I need to find all these archived old TV shows and put them on the web.
[00:40:36.630 --> 00:40:38.071]  But Mike Hanson has most of them.
[00:40:38.111 --> 00:40:41.534]  I need him to dig those out of his storage before the three-quarter inch tapes fall apart.
[00:40:41.914 --> 00:40:42.495]  But I didn't.
[00:40:42.575 --> 00:40:44.617]  I mean, I knew it was a land grab, but I went to it.
[00:40:45.077 --> 00:40:48.100]  There were thousands of people at the new Austin Convention Center at the time.
[00:40:48.560 --> 00:40:56.007]  There were former Dallas Cowboys and Bank One Chairman and Bank of America Chairman and big Republicans and Michael Dell.
[00:40:56.948 --> 00:40:58.209]  But this wasn't for the media.
[00:40:58.249 --> 00:41:00.491]  This was for all the city managers of the whole country.
[00:41:01.261 --> 00:41:09.667]  They just said, we're taking all the property, this is a great business operation, and I would go to press conferences and talk to them, and they'd say, yeah, we're taking the property.
[00:41:09.907 --> 00:41:11.408]  And they'd laugh at me, doctor.
[00:41:11.829 --> 00:41:21.676]  They just, because they know the PR on TV and radio is saying one thing, then they go right out in plain view and just say whatever they want, knowing the media is in on it and won't report it.
[00:41:22.657 --> 00:41:22.997]  I know it.
[00:41:23.562 --> 00:41:25.727]  And that's, of course, the fault of the liberal media.
[00:41:26.088 --> 00:41:30.078]  And if you talk to some of these individual reporters, you'll find that they agree with it.
[00:41:30.098 --> 00:41:31.260]  They think it's a great idea.
[00:41:31.441 --> 00:41:31.701]  Why?
[00:41:31.782 --> 00:41:33.506]  Because that's where they have been educated.
[00:41:34.102 --> 00:41:46.191]  And that's why we should get our kids out of schools and teach them the facts of life at home and hopefully they will stick with them when they go through college because right now our colleges are nothing more than indoctrination camps.
[00:41:46.591 --> 00:41:47.092]  Exactly.
[00:41:47.132 --> 00:41:49.333]  You've been to a lot of these meetings.
[00:41:49.553 --> 00:41:50.734]  You've studied their documents.
[00:41:50.794 --> 00:41:51.395]  You've talked to them.
[00:41:51.675 --> 00:41:59.721]  When you talk to the minions though, the cannon fodder that buys into it, are you able to ever deprogram them and show the environmentalists that it has nothing to do with the environment?
[00:42:00.367 --> 00:42:23.139]  Yes, in fact, Alex, when I've given talks in the past, we've had some of these plants in the Sierra Club, or the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, which is an international environmental organization, very powerful, extremely powerful organization, there to discredit me, and if they let me have the time to develop it logically, I've seen them go into a state of shock as they realize what they're involved in.
[00:42:23.299 --> 00:42:23.700]  Literally.
[00:42:23.940 --> 00:42:24.240]  Exactly.
[00:42:24.260 --> 00:42:27.702]  I've had people get up and apologize to the audience for their involvement in what they're doing.
[00:42:29.036 --> 00:42:29.876]  And see, that's the key.
[00:42:29.916 --> 00:42:31.397]  The truth is powerful.
[00:42:31.977 --> 00:42:33.477]  If we're able to... Exactly.
[00:42:33.497 --> 00:42:35.798]  I mean, look, all the liberals I know are buying guns.
[00:42:36.178 --> 00:42:38.079]  They realize the environmental movements are fraud.
[00:42:38.139 --> 00:42:39.279]  They still are environmentalists.
[00:42:39.299 --> 00:42:40.760]  They're just really environmentalists.
[00:42:41.160 --> 00:42:43.481]  I mean, none of us want to drink dirty water and air, folks.
[00:42:44.141 --> 00:42:46.081]  But they don't... They've got to understand.
[00:42:46.161 --> 00:42:47.562]  It is diabolical!
[00:42:48.262 --> 00:42:50.883]  I mean, I know the ranchers and farmers that have their land stolen.
[00:42:51.263 --> 00:42:52.824]  Then they build shopping malls on it.
[00:42:53.104 --> 00:42:55.024]  It has nothing to do with the environment!
[00:42:56.025 --> 00:42:57.525]  It has nothing to do with the environment.
[00:42:57.884 --> 00:43:01.246]  Has nothing to do with the quality of life, even though they'll tell you that.
[00:43:01.686 --> 00:43:05.067]  It's all a sham, it's all a fraud, in order to take your land.
[00:43:05.507 --> 00:43:21.435]  And of course, the Kello decision a year and a half ago, back in June of 2005, has just opened the doors to the floodgates of communities, these local governments, basically condemning land for ten cents on the dollar, and taking it for development of another private enterprise.
[00:43:21.515 --> 00:43:26.537]  We're going to go to Vietnam and take a call here in a moment, but I want to tell a story about local environmentalists with Save Our Springs.
[00:43:27.702 --> 00:43:36.927]  Back in the early nineties when they were going to steal all this property, these guys were on TV, radio, they were worshipped, they were heroes, and then now you want to see them, they've grabbed all the land.
[00:43:36.947 --> 00:43:43.931]  They'll go protest now when they build a shopping mall or luxury million dollar homes on it, but now the news won't cover them and now they get it.
[00:43:44.251 --> 00:43:45.212]  See, they were used.
[00:43:45.232 --> 00:43:49.254]  They also used the locals to give it the illusion that it's grassroots.
[00:43:50.040 --> 00:43:50.280]  Yes.
[00:43:50.480 --> 00:43:55.443]  In fact, that is the primary thing right there is that the whole environmental movement is being used.
[00:43:55.883 --> 00:44:00.325]  Once they have what they want, the local environmental leaders and so forth, they'll be out in their ears.
[00:44:01.786 --> 00:44:03.387]  They can care less about the environment.
[00:44:03.827 --> 00:44:06.869]  Well, you know, the biggest landowner in the United States is the Sierra Club.
[00:44:07.689 --> 00:44:08.810]  Yes.
[00:44:08.870 --> 00:44:09.610]  Nature Conservancy.
[00:44:09.670 --> 00:44:10.951]  Excuse me, I always get the two mixed up.
[00:44:10.971 --> 00:44:11.251]  That's right.
[00:44:11.291 --> 00:44:12.492]  Nature Conservancy, Sierra Club.
[00:44:12.532 --> 00:44:12.932]  Excuse me.
[00:44:13.652 --> 00:44:14.513]  That's the order, correct?
[00:44:15.677 --> 00:44:16.118]  Yes.
[00:44:16.138 --> 00:44:20.761]  So the Nature Conservancy, I mean, they're a mafia.
[00:44:20.781 --> 00:44:22.142]  It's just incredible.
[00:44:23.563 --> 00:44:24.203]  It really is.
[00:44:24.383 --> 00:44:25.684]  They started out on a good premise.
[00:44:26.184 --> 00:44:35.991]  If you want it, you should buy it, but at the same time now they've got their power and they're using the government basically as, like you say, a mafia, and a poor landowner whose land they want.
[00:44:36.111 --> 00:44:37.272]  They don't have a chance.
[00:44:38.177 --> 00:44:52.605]  So how it works is, by the way, all the big real estate councils of the country are for it, and it's not because they love the birdies or the snails or the worms or the spiders or the cave bugs that have caused the building to stop around here in many areas.
[00:44:52.945 --> 00:45:03.031]  It lays off whole corridors and then instantly jacks up their prices, and then everybody forgets, on average, after five years, then they end up going in and sweetheart deals with the government
[00:45:03.451 --> 00:45:09.296]  The county-city government that now controls it, and then they're giving the land for almost nothing, then the restrictions are taken off!
[00:45:09.356 --> 00:45:11.298]  I mean, they ought to all be arrested!
[00:45:11.318 --> 00:45:14.701]  They really ought to, because it is extortion.
[00:45:14.981 --> 00:45:18.765]  It's about every crime in the book, except it's the government that can get away with it.
[00:45:20.366 --> 00:45:20.887]  Absolutely.
[00:45:20.927 --> 00:45:22.488]  Is our caller from Vietnam still there?
[00:45:23.549 --> 00:45:24.870]  Beyond, thank you for holding.
[00:45:24.890 --> 00:45:27.172]  I appreciate your call from all the way from Vietnam.
[00:45:27.232 --> 00:45:27.953]  Bush is there.
[00:45:28.533 --> 00:45:29.394]  I guess, or was there.
[00:45:29.434 --> 00:45:30.175]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:45:33.450 --> 00:45:34.110]  Hello, caller?
[00:45:38.712 --> 00:45:39.892]  Sounds like his phone may have broke.
[00:45:39.912 --> 00:45:40.512]  Put him back on hold.
[00:45:40.532 --> 00:45:41.692]  I've never gotten a call from Vietnam.
[00:45:41.712 --> 00:45:45.533]  I want to see if he's able to be there in a moment, or he might have stepped away from his computer.
[00:45:46.154 --> 00:45:49.074]  And we're going to go back to your calls in a few minutes, folks, but I do want to talk to Bjorn.
[00:45:49.895 --> 00:45:52.295]  Talk to him, John, until he gets back on the line.
[00:45:52.735 --> 00:45:56.557]  I've gotten a call from Antarctica McMurtle Air Station, weather station.
[00:45:56.617 --> 00:46:01.238]  I've gotten calls from Japan and everywhere else, but I haven't got one from Vietnam yet.
[00:46:02.358 --> 00:46:05.600]  Dr. Colvin, let's just briefly, because I know we're running low on time, I want to take some calls.
[00:46:06.080 --> 00:46:12.923]  What are the different power blocks, according to your research, inside this New World Order?
[00:46:13.824 --> 00:46:21.507]  Well, the first one is the Anglo-American faction that was described by Carol Quigley in his 1966 book, The Tragedy and Hope.
[00:46:21.988 --> 00:46:28.491]  That is the all-powerful entity made up basically of the financial institutions of the United States and Great Britain.
[00:46:28.591 --> 00:46:29.451]  Anglo-American.
[00:46:30.172 --> 00:46:31.012]  The Anglo-American.
[00:46:31.605 --> 00:46:33.286]  Uh, they have the greatest amount of power.
[00:46:33.306 --> 00:46:36.308]  They're involved in every aspect of our lives and you don't even know it.
[00:46:36.488 --> 00:46:42.052]  They basically control the political process, the judicial process, the educational process here in this country.
[00:46:42.072 --> 00:46:44.193]  And that's why we're in the problems that we are right now.
[00:46:44.673 --> 00:46:47.255]  Then you have the socialist European faction.
[00:46:47.717 --> 00:46:50.919]  Which is vying for power with the Anglo-American faction.
[00:46:51.080 --> 00:46:52.340]  It's led by France and Germany.
[00:46:52.681 --> 00:46:58.385]  Ever wonder why France and Germany never seem to support us on these international ventures that England always is there?
[00:46:58.745 --> 00:46:59.446]  Well, that's why.
[00:47:00.006 --> 00:47:01.527]  And I explain that in the DVD.
[00:47:01.948 --> 00:47:10.534]  And going on, you have the U.S.S.R., the former U.S.S.R., the Soviet Union, the Soviet Bloc, I shouldn't say the Soviet Union, the Russian Federation.
[00:47:10.554 --> 00:47:15.898]  And by the way, they put the hammers and sickles back on and now call themselves that again, and the general public doesn't even know it.
[00:47:16.468 --> 00:47:18.589]  Yeah, nothing's really changed.
[00:47:18.609 --> 00:47:26.551]  They're going back to what they had before, but they're still trying to gain power so that they have a niche in this, if not come out of the dominant partner.
[00:47:27.111 --> 00:47:27.951]  And so is China.
[00:47:28.131 --> 00:47:29.771]  China is another major one.
[00:47:29.811 --> 00:47:38.533]  If you wonder why all these things, and they're all the time, you never see it in the local newspaper, the evening news or anything, there's all these tensions going on underneath the scenes.
[00:47:38.553 --> 00:47:43.235]  They're trying to undercut us, or us them, at every step of the way.
[00:47:43.935 --> 00:47:44.195]  And it's
[00:47:45.356 --> 00:47:46.956]  A tension that will never go away.
[00:47:47.016 --> 00:47:51.457]  We're going to have a world government sooner or later, as far as they're concerned, and they want to be on top.
[00:47:51.898 --> 00:47:58.119]  And finally, the Arab League itself, or the radical Islamists, are another one.
[00:47:58.499 --> 00:48:04.720]  They're being used by the Muslims in general, or the Arabs in general, as a front.
[00:48:04.760 --> 00:48:06.621]  They're being funded by this, as you well know.
[00:48:06.661 --> 00:48:11.322]  They're being funded by the Saudi families and the rich, oil-rich Arab nations.
[00:48:11.815 --> 00:48:16.978]  In order to destabilize the West and create a niche for themselves.
[00:48:17.038 --> 00:48:21.040]  They want to dominate the world just as much as the Anglo-American factor.
[00:48:21.060 --> 00:48:25.523]  But the Anglo-Americans helped set up a lot of those countries in the 1915 to 1925.
[00:48:25.883 --> 00:48:30.686]  And so from my research, there's a major connection.
[00:48:30.746 --> 00:48:32.627]  Also, they're involved in the secret societies.
[00:48:33.407 --> 00:48:36.229]  Uh, and the Knights Templar, so I see a big connection.
[00:48:36.249 --> 00:48:42.913]  I see the Anglo-American, the European faction, and the Arab faction, even though it doesn't look like that on the surface, a lot of undercurrent connections.
[00:48:43.654 --> 00:48:44.294]  Yes, there are.
[00:48:44.354 --> 00:48:49.457]  In fact, obviously, we set the whole thing up, the CIA set up Al-Qaeda, and all the rest.
[00:48:49.537 --> 00:48:56.582]  The tensions that we're facing right now, the terrorisms that we are facing right now, were created by the CIA, as you have talked about on your program.
[00:48:58.099 --> 00:49:05.019]  Once you begin to understand this whole process, it all starts to make sense as to why all these very strange things happen.
[00:49:06.539 --> 00:49:07.819]  How long do you think they'll start?
[00:49:07.859 --> 00:49:11.461]  Because I know the North American Union, they're already operating under SPP.
[00:49:12.121 --> 00:49:16.542]  They announced two weeks ago that the Asian Union had been in effect for a decade, but they publicly announced it.
[00:49:16.562 --> 00:49:17.403]  That was in Reuters.
[00:49:18.303 --> 00:49:27.606]  And now, through the North American Union, they're already making treaties with the EU, so they're really already connecting to each other, and we're already really going into a trilateral world government.
[00:49:28.626 --> 00:49:29.106]  Absolutely.
[00:49:29.146 --> 00:49:30.727]  There's no question that they're
[00:49:31.434 --> 00:49:33.455]  There's no intention of them failing in this.
[00:49:33.495 --> 00:49:43.422]  This has been one of the goals of the Trilateral Commission right from its inception in 1973, is to create a North American Union, as well as others.
[00:49:43.702 --> 00:49:50.507]  They've wanted to divide this whole world up into economic units since the 1970s, early 1970s.
[00:49:50.547 --> 00:49:51.608]  So has the Club of Rome.
[00:49:52.248 --> 00:49:54.690]  They even published a map back in 1973 showing ten financial kingdoms.
[00:49:58.752 --> 00:50:01.875]  And that's what the Trilateral Commission is also doing.
[00:50:01.915 --> 00:50:10.244]  I'll explain all this in the DVD, showing how they have actually intended to do this for over 30 years now.
[00:50:11.065 --> 00:50:12.966]  This is nothing new.
[00:50:13.347 --> 00:50:14.828]  They've been planning this for a long time.
[00:50:15.936 --> 00:50:27.507]  For years, if you even mention the Club of Rome or the Trilateral Commission or something, people will look at you like you're from Mars, because everybody knew back in the 1970s and early 1980s that those organizations didn't.
[00:50:27.587 --> 00:50:28.928]  It was all conspiracy stories.
[00:50:28.948 --> 00:50:29.529]  Are you kidding?
[00:50:29.649 --> 00:50:35.895]  I remember in 2000, the New York Times said I was a made-up Bilderberg.
[00:50:37.817 --> 00:50:39.178]  I mean, they were still doing it then.
[00:50:39.218 --> 00:50:39.959]  You're right, Doctor.
[00:50:41.810 --> 00:50:44.132]  I mean, these people are incredible.
[00:50:44.552 --> 00:50:46.373]  Remember when it didn't exist, folks?
[00:50:46.954 --> 00:50:48.635]  The North American Union didn't exist?
[00:50:49.455 --> 00:50:50.976]  Let's talk about their plans to kill us.
[00:50:50.996 --> 00:50:54.679]  Let me get back, because that is the final plan of old Beelzebub, isn't it?
[00:50:55.840 --> 00:50:58.181]  And we'll take your calls, I promise, on the other side.
[00:50:58.201 --> 00:50:59.002]  Stay with us.
[00:51:04.372 --> 00:51:04.832]  It's here!
[00:51:05.033 --> 00:51:09.796]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:51:10.176 --> 00:51:17.841]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:18.521 --> 00:51:25.585]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:51:25.986 --> 00:51:32.890]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying,
[00:51:33.348 --> 00:51:37.410]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:51:37.710 --> 00:51:41.212]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:51:41.672 --> 00:51:43.573]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:51:43.934 --> 00:51:47.856]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:52:00.948 --> 00:52:09.193]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[00:52:09.454 --> 00:52:13.816]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[00:52:14.097 --> 00:52:23.022]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[00:52:23.223 --> 00:52:26.845]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[00:52:27.125 --> 00:52:32.153]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[00:52:32.453 --> 00:52:39.204]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[00:52:39.685 --> 00:52:40.225]  What about you?
[00:52:40.974 --> 00:52:46.317]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[00:53:56.825 --> 00:53:59.447]  Celebrating 18 years of dedication.
[00:54:16.531 --> 00:54:18.091]  Welcome back ladies and gentlemen.
[00:54:18.131 --> 00:54:20.292]  Thank you so much for joining us today.
[00:54:20.312 --> 00:54:28.395]  I'm going to keep Dr. Michael Coughlin with us a little bit into the next hour and we've got Mayor Pro Tem
[00:54:30.402 --> 00:54:37.175]  Coming on from Farmer's Branch up in Dallas, my old stomping grounds, where they're standing up against the open borders invasion.
[00:54:38.538 --> 00:54:41.283]  But just in a nutshell, Doctor,
[00:54:42.805 --> 00:54:57.351]  Please break down for us, I mean obviously the population reduction agenda that Dr. Pianca has been calling for, the 80-90% they publicly state, can you give us your analysis of that and when in the global government plan they'll start to fully implement that?
[00:54:57.371 --> 00:55:04.994]  I mean we know they're doing it in China now and doing it through abortion and other things, but how are they going to really get the huge population reduction they say they're going to implement?
[00:55:05.879 --> 00:55:06.760]  Well, there's two things.
[00:55:07.140 --> 00:55:20.447]  One of the things that we tumbled onto when we stopped the Biodiversity Treaty from being ratified 12, 13 years ago was the fact that they call for a human population of no more than 1 to 2 billion people in planet Earth.
[00:55:20.487 --> 00:55:24.409]  That's a two-thirds to three-quarter reduction of the planetary population.
[00:55:24.429 --> 00:55:27.311]  And they say ideally, ideally 500 million, though.
[00:55:27.851 --> 00:55:33.114]  Yeah, ideally it's 500 million, but they wanted to get down immediately, within 50 years, to 1 to 2 billion.
[00:55:33.815 --> 00:55:57.802]  And the way that they were planning on doing that, according to their own words, is that they wanted to make the environment so critically important that we could no longer use pesticides, we could no longer use herbicides and so forth in growing food, and food production would be cut by about one-half to two-thirds, and of course you know what happens if you don't have any food to eat, you normally will expire within a year.
[00:55:57.842 --> 00:56:00.983]  Well, it's like how they banned DDT that really wasn't hurting the birds.
[00:56:01.043 --> 00:56:02.664]  That kills tens of millions a year.
[00:56:03.484 --> 00:56:04.625]  Yes.
[00:56:04.665 --> 00:56:07.306]  Now, Dr. Coffman, let me comment on this because this is really important.
[00:56:07.326 --> 00:56:07.866]  Let's be clear.
[00:56:08.447 --> 00:56:12.949]  They're not talking about advances in food production or good genetic engineering or any of these things.
[00:56:13.029 --> 00:56:20.113]  They're going from the point of view that man's the problem and must be gotten rid of, not even thinking about what developments there'll be in the next 50 years.
[00:56:20.413 --> 00:56:25.476]  Plus, the very people running this don't care about the environment and are doing everything they can to really destroy it.
[00:56:25.596 --> 00:56:29.118]  So what is the driving force behind this psychopathic behavior?
[00:56:30.097 --> 00:56:32.259]  I think the desire for control, power.
[00:56:32.980 --> 00:56:36.163]  You can say money, but they've already got all the money they could ever possibly use.
[00:56:36.283 --> 00:56:40.207]  Money is only a means to an end, and that is power.
[00:56:40.447 --> 00:56:40.928]  Well, that's right.
[00:56:40.948 --> 00:56:45.072]  People always say they don't want to kill us.
[00:56:45.112 --> 00:56:46.013]  They need the money.
[00:56:46.293 --> 00:56:47.494]  Folks, they print the money.
[00:56:48.095 --> 00:56:49.376]  The money is the way to control us.
[00:56:49.416 --> 00:56:49.917]  Sorry, go ahead.
[00:56:51.058 --> 00:56:52.879]  And that's the key thing that we have to recognize.
[00:56:52.899 --> 00:56:56.621]  They're not like you and I, who are really trying to get money just to survive.
[00:56:57.061 --> 00:56:59.203]  They have more money than they could possibly use.
[00:56:59.643 --> 00:57:01.984]  They do use their money to gain more and more power.
[00:57:02.004 --> 00:57:03.165]  They want to be in control.
[00:57:03.245 --> 00:57:06.346]  It's an age-old desire, even of Satan himself.
[00:57:06.406 --> 00:57:07.547]  He wants to be in control.
[00:57:07.927 --> 00:57:15.371]  And they want to have us at a subsistence level, because then we're totally desperate and under their control, which is feudalism.
[00:57:15.631 --> 00:57:17.252]  So, hence, it's neo-feudalism.
[00:57:17.950 --> 00:57:21.672]  In fact, in the Global Biodiversity Assessment that we gave the U.S.
[00:57:21.692 --> 00:57:29.776]  Senate to stop the Biodiversity Treaty, we highlighted one of the sections which basically said they wanted to re-establish the old feudal system of the Dark Ages.
[00:57:30.137 --> 00:57:39.041]  In fact, I used that sub-section of the Biodiversity Assessment at the end of Road to Tyranny, where it says, they talk about how wonderful human sacrifice is.
[00:57:39.061 --> 00:57:39.241]  Yes.
[00:57:41.255 --> 00:57:41.776]  Absolutely.
[00:57:42.236 --> 00:57:51.583]  And of course, the whole concept of Mother Earth religion, or this pantheistic type of religion, almost always inevitably leads to human sacrifice.
[00:57:52.248 --> 00:57:52.848]  Almost always.
[00:57:52.869 --> 00:57:55.931]  It wouldn't be in this generation, of course, but it would certainly be in the next generation.
[00:57:56.531 --> 00:57:58.652]  Dr. Kaufman, what are you doing in the next hour?
[00:57:58.692 --> 00:58:06.438]  I've got a mayor coming on from Farmer's Branch, but I'm only going to have him about 10 minutes, and this is so important.
[00:58:07.098 --> 00:58:08.439]  45 minutes just blew past us.
[00:58:12.562 --> 00:58:12.862]  I know.
[00:58:12.942 --> 00:58:16.204]  Unfortunately, we were about to take off to go to my son's house for Thanksgiving.
[00:58:16.444 --> 00:58:17.165]  Well, do that.
[00:58:17.225 --> 00:58:24.830]  Let's do five more minutes on the other side and blitz through Jeff, Bill, and Nick's calls at least, maybe even Brian, and then we'll have to get you back up soon, sir.
[00:58:25.691 --> 00:58:26.191]  Absolutely.
[00:58:26.251 --> 00:58:27.232]  I really enjoyed this.
[00:58:27.592 --> 00:58:29.173]  Well, we're going to be back in 60 seconds.
[00:58:29.593 --> 00:58:36.638]  Dr. Michael Kaufman, we've got the video, World Events and Prophecy, available at InfoWars.com right now.
[00:58:36.818 --> 00:58:37.579]  We'll be right back.
[00:58:41.232 --> 00:58:46.074]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNLive.com or call toll free 877-300-7645.
[00:58:46.114 --> 00:58:46.554]  Big Brother.
[00:58:46.714 --> 00:58:47.494]  Mainstream media.
[00:58:47.714 --> 00:58:53.536]  Government cover-ups.
[00:58:53.716 --> 00:58:55.937]  You want answers?
[00:59:03.906 --> 00:59:04.787]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:04.807 --> 00:59:09.411]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.631 --> 00:59:13.755]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:16.017 --> 00:59:17.538]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:59:17.619 --> 00:59:21.162]  We are now into our number three.
[00:59:21.242 --> 00:59:22.523]  Let's go to Jeff in New York.
[00:59:22.583 --> 00:59:24.064]  You're on the air with Dr. Michael Kaufman.
[00:59:24.104 --> 00:59:24.925]  Thank you for holding here.
[00:59:24.945 --> 00:59:25.566]  A real trooper.
[00:59:25.586 --> 00:59:26.286]  What's on your mind?
[00:59:26.827 --> 00:59:27.287]  Hey, Alex.
[00:59:27.407 --> 00:59:29.549]  This is Jeff that sent you the 522 Mason footage.
[00:59:30.771 --> 00:59:34.954]  That's right, the Masons let you in and let you videotape all their bizarreness up there, yes.
[00:59:35.535 --> 00:59:38.056]  Yeah, um, I wanted to give a program announcement.
[00:59:38.096 --> 00:59:44.021]  My public access show, Expose and Defeat Tyranny, is airing now in the town that I filmed that in.
[00:59:44.528 --> 00:59:48.211]  And next week, I'll be showing that episode on the show in the town it was filmed in.
[00:59:49.151 --> 00:59:49.692]  What was that?
[00:59:49.812 --> 00:59:50.232]  Lodge 533?
[00:59:50.973 --> 00:59:50.232]  522.
[00:59:50.993 --> 00:59:54.415]  522.
[00:59:51.033 --> 00:59:54.415]  That's the one.
[00:59:54.455 --> 00:59:56.116]  My hometown is Skinny Atlas, New York.
[00:59:56.336 --> 00:59:57.117]  Well, good job.
[00:59:57.137 --> 00:59:59.499]  What do you think of what Dr. Michael Kaufman is talking about?
[00:59:59.519 --> 01:00:06.483]  It's the stuff you've been talking about, Alex, and I see the Masons must be involved in this too, in this world religion thing.
[01:00:06.503 --> 01:00:11.387]  On my DVD, I spend about 15, well, about 10 minutes on Masonry.
[01:00:12.168 --> 01:00:23.836]  Well, let me just tell listeners, anybody who has access TV shows in the country, if it's pretty good, I'll put it on PrisonPlanet.tv, where a lot of people can see it, and then folks grab it off that and put it on Google.
[01:00:24.196 --> 01:00:32.982]  So send me your TV show, Jeff, and I'll not just, you know, with the video you shot, but I'll put your, because I know your work's really good, send me your access TV show, I'll put it on the web.
[01:00:33.282 --> 01:00:34.523]  Great, I was going to suggest that.
[01:00:34.563 --> 01:00:39.587]  I have an intro that I made up with black helicopter footage and local politicians from the state,
[01:00:40.367 --> 01:00:42.608]  Bill and Hillary Clinton that I met a couple years back.
[01:00:43.508 --> 01:00:48.810]  I have some George Bush puppet parody TV commercials that I do.
[01:00:48.850 --> 01:00:49.891]  I'd like to send you those too.
[01:00:49.931 --> 01:00:50.911]  Maybe you'll get a kick out of it.
[01:00:50.951 --> 01:00:51.151]  No, no, no.
[01:00:51.171 --> 01:00:52.912]  Yeah, that's what we're trying to expand.
[01:00:52.932 --> 01:00:55.693]  You know, help everybody get their information out.
[01:00:55.713 --> 01:00:56.513]  Great.
[01:00:56.874 --> 01:01:05.417]  I have a clip from a local news show the other day where Walmart had taken off their shelves a Skull & Bones t-shirt because it looked
[01:01:06.058 --> 01:01:07.879]  Just exactly like the Nazis do.
[01:01:07.899 --> 01:01:09.641]  I was wondering if you want me to send you that, too.
[01:01:09.661 --> 01:01:11.042]  I could play you the clip right now if you want.
[01:01:11.062 --> 01:01:11.162]  Sure.
[01:01:11.702 --> 01:01:14.224]  No, I mean, I know skull and bones are in style right now.
[01:01:14.244 --> 01:01:16.105]  I was at Target and there were like five shirts.
[01:01:16.125 --> 01:01:17.787]  I was trying to buy some shirts, t-shirts.
[01:01:17.807 --> 01:01:19.027]  They all had skulls on them.
[01:01:19.628 --> 01:01:20.529]  So I was having trouble.
[01:01:21.829 --> 01:01:23.891]  I mean, there's just the worship of death is everywhere.
[01:01:23.991 --> 01:01:26.273]  Aren't they inculcating this into us, Dr. Kaufman?
[01:01:26.693 --> 01:01:27.594]  Yes, they absolutely are.
[01:01:27.614 --> 01:01:28.895]  That's part of this whole religion.
[01:01:31.356 --> 01:01:32.817]  One aspect of it is death.
[01:01:35.067 --> 01:01:43.831]  We talk about that and some of the symbolism on the Ark of the Covenant, or Ark of the Hope, that was sent to the United Nations in Johannesburg in 2002.
[01:01:45.591 --> 01:01:46.152]  Amazing.
[01:01:46.412 --> 01:01:48.352]  Hey Jeff, it's good hearing from you, brother.
[01:01:48.812 --> 01:01:49.613]  Good to hear from you, Alex.
[01:01:49.933 --> 01:01:50.913]  Yeah, and call back another time.
[01:01:50.953 --> 01:01:51.914]  I don't have all these guests on.
[01:01:51.974 --> 01:01:53.034]  I'd like to talk to you some more.
[01:01:53.614 --> 01:01:54.875]  Let's talk to Bill in Iowa.
[01:01:54.895 --> 01:01:55.755]  Bill, thanks for holding.
[01:01:55.795 --> 01:01:56.275]  Go ahead.
[01:01:57.276 --> 01:01:57.956]  Hello, Alex.
[01:01:58.136 --> 01:01:58.416]  Hi.
[01:01:58.436 --> 01:02:01.117]  I owe you a deep apology.
[01:02:01.177 --> 01:02:02.077]  Do you remember me?
[01:02:03.038 --> 01:02:03.478]  No, I don't.
[01:02:04.634 --> 01:02:07.817]  I was the one that called about election voting.
[01:02:10.198 --> 01:02:10.979]  And what were you saying?
[01:02:11.019 --> 01:02:11.579]  I don't remember.
[01:02:12.880 --> 01:02:14.402]  That doesn't matter.
[01:02:14.762 --> 01:02:15.863]  You disagreed with me.
[01:02:15.943 --> 01:02:18.224]  So, anyway, hello to your guest.
[01:02:18.445 --> 01:02:19.645]  Well, I mean, what did we disagree about?
[01:02:19.665 --> 01:02:20.766]  So I turned out being right?
[01:02:22.908 --> 01:02:23.709]  Yes, you did.
[01:02:23.729 --> 01:02:27.812]  I challenged you on whether or not you voted or not.
[01:02:27.992 --> 01:02:28.672]  Oh, I remember.
[01:02:28.732 --> 01:02:29.953]  Yes, yes.
[01:02:30.374 --> 01:02:31.995]  I owe you a deep
[01:02:32.967 --> 01:02:34.688]  Sincere apology for that.
[01:02:34.928 --> 01:02:35.728]  Well, don't worry about it.
[01:02:36.309 --> 01:02:37.529]  Do you have a quick question for our guest?
[01:02:39.870 --> 01:02:54.537]  Not really for your guest, but I just got Terror Storm, well, one of the several copies that I had, and the Freedom to Fascism movie that just came in yesterday.
[01:02:54.557 --> 01:02:56.558]  Wow, that blew me away.
[01:03:01.172 --> 01:03:07.936]  I was hoping that I could talk to you without a guest being on, but anyway... Well, you know, I'll put you back on hold and I'll get to you a little bit later if you'll just keep holding.
[01:03:08.616 --> 01:03:10.377]  We're out of time and I know we've got a load of phone lines.
[01:03:10.397 --> 01:03:11.517]  We're going to get to everybody's calls.
[01:03:11.797 --> 01:03:18.621]  Dr. Michael Coffin is going to head off now to start Thanksgiving to go be with his family and I'll be talking to him when he gets back from Thanksgiving.
[01:03:18.641 --> 01:03:25.925]  I think we're going to have him come to town and we'll probably have him in studio here and interview him for the upcoming film.
[01:03:26.645 --> 01:03:28.426]  Doctor, why don't you fire out your website too?
[01:03:29.395 --> 01:03:32.739]  It's www.discerningtoday.org.
[01:03:33.199 --> 01:03:34.921]  Discerningtoday.org.
[01:03:35.001 --> 01:03:38.865]  That's D-I-S-C-E-R-N-I-N-G today.org.
[01:03:39.126 --> 01:03:41.048]  We didn't even scratch the service.
[01:03:41.068 --> 01:03:42.690]  I've got to have you back on in the near future.
[01:03:43.050 --> 01:03:44.552]  God bless you, my friend, and be safe.
[01:03:45.192 --> 01:03:45.773]  Oh, thank you.
[01:03:46.173 --> 01:03:46.634]  Take care.
[01:03:46.974 --> 01:03:48.816]  We'll come right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:03:48.876 --> 01:03:49.357]  Stay with us.
[01:03:56.377 --> 01:03:59.580]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[01:03:59.920 --> 01:04:01.862]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[01:04:02.222 --> 01:04:09.888]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:04:10.568 --> 01:04:17.614]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:04:18.014 --> 01:04:24.900]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying,
[01:04:25.379 --> 01:04:29.442]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:04:29.742 --> 01:04:33.245]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:04:33.705 --> 01:04:35.606]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:04:35.966 --> 01:04:39.889]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:06:54.227 --> 01:06:59.791]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:01.380 --> 01:07:02.100]  I'm not liberal.
[01:07:03.381 --> 01:07:04.322]  I'm not conservative.
[01:07:04.482 --> 01:07:05.602]  I'm a constitutionalist.
[01:07:05.943 --> 01:07:12.506]  I stand with the Bill of Rights, the Constitution, with the bedrock of what this country stands for.
[01:07:12.526 --> 01:07:14.127]  I don't think that's a radical stance.
[01:07:14.427 --> 01:07:15.688]  I know it's a popular stance.
[01:07:16.529 --> 01:07:20.651]  But the politicians are bought and paid for by big multinational corporations and they're killing this country.
[01:07:21.701 --> 01:07:32.806]  And the Associated Press reported two days ago that 50 plus major lending institutions give preferential treatment to illegal aliens and do not even ask for their social security number.
[01:07:33.626 --> 01:07:41.529]  I already knew this from people working in banking and people working managing apartment complexes, but now we have the proof right out in the open.
[01:07:41.569 --> 01:07:44.691]  Now that is discrimination, that is racketeering, because it's illegal.
[01:07:44.831 --> 01:07:45.551]  It's organized.
[01:07:47.008 --> 01:07:51.350]  Operation trying to allow an illegal practice to continue.
[01:07:51.390 --> 01:07:53.712]  That is definition organized crime.
[01:07:54.512 --> 01:07:55.693]  But they do it right out in the open.
[01:07:56.833 --> 01:08:01.276]  And a large portion of the illegal aliens say that this country belongs to Mexico.
[01:08:02.397 --> 01:08:08.961]  And the town of El Cenizo, the San Antonio Express News reported, does not allow anything but Spanish to be spoken in court proceedings.
[01:08:09.421 --> 01:08:10.401]  It is Spanish only.
[01:08:11.302 --> 01:08:13.043]  You get out of Mexico, it's Spanish only.
[01:08:14.341 --> 01:08:18.983]  And, uh, you go down to Mexico and you're an illegal alien, they'll put you in a jail and extort all the money out of your family.
[01:08:19.163 --> 01:08:19.783]  They're tough!
[01:08:20.783 --> 01:08:23.344]  We got 30 million illegals here, not 14 million.
[01:08:23.364 --> 01:08:24.184]  Those are the real numbers.
[01:08:24.504 --> 01:08:30.066]  You look at the Census Department numbers, and I've had Congressman Tom Tancredo on, and Pat Buchanan and Ron Paul to tell you that.
[01:08:31.347 --> 01:08:32.287]  This is the reality.
[01:08:32.747 --> 01:08:37.089]  They've had a few towns that have tried to tell their police to arrest illegal aliens, to stop them.
[01:08:37.329 --> 01:08:38.249]  I mean, I know police.
[01:08:38.289 --> 01:08:40.010]  They're told to let them go, and they don't have insurance.
[01:08:40.410 --> 01:08:43.711]  In most, uh, Vicente Fox was up here in Austin,
[01:08:44.958 --> 01:08:53.589]  Two years ago, he's not present anymore, but he was, and he gave, we have video of it, he gave an award to the police department for not following the law and making this a haven city.
[01:08:54.490 --> 01:08:59.857]  Then he gave an award to Wells Fargo for issuing them debit cards with no ID that are then used to get homes.
[01:09:01.738 --> 01:09:06.339]  Now, this is because the establishment wants to bust up this country, as Lou Dobbs has reported.
[01:09:06.719 --> 01:09:09.720]  It's the North American Union, and it's make it or break it time.
[01:09:10.100 --> 01:09:10.460]  Okay?
[01:09:10.820 --> 01:09:14.701]  Now, some little towns haven't done this right, and the ACLU swooped in on them, a bunch of crooks.
[01:09:15.341 --> 01:09:18.522]  Again, on one issue they'll be right, on ten others they'll be wrong.
[01:09:19.342 --> 01:09:24.383]  And they'll try to sue and stop it, but it's called illegal alien for a reason.
[01:09:24.423 --> 01:09:25.383]  These people are criminals.
[01:09:27.524 --> 01:09:29.504]  And a lot of them are involved in other crimes.
[01:09:30.925 --> 01:09:39.589]  And so we have got Mayor Deputy Pro Tem on with us, and we are really honored to have Tim O'Hare.
[01:09:40.249 --> 01:09:44.191]  He's from Farmers Branch that's up in Dallas-Fort Worth area, where I come from.
[01:09:44.791 --> 01:09:48.432]  And here's the Associated Press article, KXN also did a story here locally.
[01:09:48.813 --> 01:09:56.976]  Immigration issues coming up in the legislature, and it talks about Farmers Branch is telling illegal immigrants they can't live in a Dallas suburb, they can still work there though.
[01:09:57.964 --> 01:10:02.047]  City Council members and Farmer's Branch passed a controversial immigration resolution late Monday night.
[01:10:02.368 --> 01:10:05.830]  Now they said that to make it sound discriminatory or hypocritical.
[01:10:06.271 --> 01:10:09.553]  Actually, they passed resolutions saying you better not be illegal working there.
[01:10:09.754 --> 01:10:10.855]  And that's federal law!
[01:10:12.536 --> 01:10:19.762]  Okay, I mean, I know when I've had jobs at Walmart when I was in college or at a golf course, I had to show all my ID and all my stuff and the illegals didn't.
[01:10:20.002 --> 01:10:20.682]  And I'm sick of it.
[01:10:20.722 --> 01:10:21.383]  Let's go to him.
[01:10:21.783 --> 01:10:23.665]  Enough of my setup of this.
[01:10:24.620 --> 01:10:26.560]  And there's a lot of disinfo out there.
[01:10:26.640 --> 01:10:29.121]  Here it is from the man himself, who is an attorney as well.
[01:10:29.621 --> 01:10:31.642]  And again, we salute him, Tim O'Hare.
[01:10:31.942 --> 01:10:33.742]  Thank you for coming on, Mayor Pro Tem.
[01:10:34.462 --> 01:10:35.862]  Alex, thank you very much for having me.
[01:10:35.882 --> 01:10:39.083]  It doesn't appear like you are fired up about this issue at all.
[01:10:39.503 --> 01:10:41.003]  Well, I mean, I love America!
[01:10:41.023 --> 01:10:51.806]  I'm one of those people who gets a tear in their eye at the football game when they say the national anthem, and I'm mad!
[01:10:53.550 --> 01:10:53.990]  Well, you know what?
[01:10:54.010 --> 01:10:54.911]  More power to you.
[01:10:55.071 --> 01:11:03.519]  And it's guys like you all across the country that are helping councils and states to pass these measures when the federal government won't.
[01:11:03.539 --> 01:11:05.180]  So we appreciate what you're doing.
[01:11:05.660 --> 01:11:06.721]  Well, we appreciate you.
[01:11:07.142 --> 01:11:08.503]  Now, you guys have got your act together.
[01:11:09.023 --> 01:11:09.904]  I hope they don't beat you.
[01:11:09.924 --> 01:11:10.765]  We were talking during the break.
[01:11:10.785 --> 01:11:12.286]  You said you guys are going to stay the course.
[01:11:13.828 --> 01:11:16.950]  Break down what the city council really did and why you did it.
[01:11:17.571 --> 01:11:18.972]  We basically did three things.
[01:11:19.312 --> 01:11:20.093]  We passed
[01:11:20.703 --> 01:11:24.184]  A resolution that's named English as the official language of the city.
[01:11:24.364 --> 01:11:29.705]  And that part of it is largely symbolic, but it did two other things that I thought were pretty important.
[01:11:29.865 --> 01:11:36.187]  One, it said the city's not going to print materials or post signage in any language other than English from this point forward.
[01:11:36.287 --> 01:11:36.747]  I love it!
[01:11:37.107 --> 01:11:48.230]  And the second thing that it did, which was my favorite part of the whole deal, if you seek employment with the City of Farmers Branch, you cannot be denied, now that we've passed that resolution,
[01:11:48.678 --> 01:11:51.280]  On the basis that the only language you speak is English.
[01:11:52.361 --> 01:11:56.364]  And I think that is long overdue because we are seeing people all across the Metroplex.
[01:11:57.020 --> 01:11:59.241]  Lose jobs because they're not bilingual.
[01:11:59.421 --> 01:12:01.943]  And I don't think that's fair, and I don't think that's the way this country should be.
[01:12:02.243 --> 01:12:09.086]  By the way, I have a lot of friends in California and in Dallas, but big cities is my point, master chefs.
[01:12:10.067 --> 01:12:16.790]  And all the restaurants have been taken over by illegal aliens from Mexico, and they finally just tell you, get out of here!
[01:12:17.211 --> 01:12:19.212]  We don't want you here if you don't speak Spanish.
[01:12:19.632 --> 01:12:23.834]  And a lot of jobs out there tell people, no, if you're not bilingual, no job.
[01:12:24.134 --> 01:12:25.355]  And that is discriminatory.
[01:12:26.235 --> 01:12:27.216]  I couldn't agree more.
[01:12:27.236 --> 01:12:28.636]  We passed two other measures.
[01:12:29.596 --> 01:12:49.982]  One of them was to send our police officers to receive 287G training, which if your listeners are not aware what that is, it's basically the federal government offers state and local law enforcement officials the opportunity to be trained essentially to act as ICE agents and conduct themselves with regards to illegals as ICE agents.
[01:12:50.002 --> 01:12:50.762]  So we authorized that.
[01:12:50.782 --> 01:12:52.923]  And then the third thing we did was
[01:12:54.281 --> 01:12:59.485]  Agreed to fine landlords who rent to people who are living in apartment complexes.
[01:12:59.545 --> 01:13:00.225]  That's the key.
[01:13:00.926 --> 01:13:01.626]  That's a big one.
[01:13:01.746 --> 01:13:07.951]  And we've had, like you said, they put in the paper that we didn't do the business deal.
[01:13:07.991 --> 01:13:09.892]  We didn't fine businesses who employ them.
[01:13:10.933 --> 01:13:13.395]  And what I would say about this, we haven't done it yet.
[01:13:15.157 --> 01:13:20.760]  Our goal is to keep illegal aliens out of Farmer's Branch and to make Farmer's Branch unattractive to them.
[01:13:20.920 --> 01:13:21.700]  Well, exactly.
[01:13:21.740 --> 01:13:24.361]  You're taking four big bites right now.
[01:13:24.381 --> 01:13:27.602]  I mean, you're eating like a hundred-ounce T-bone right now.
[01:13:27.622 --> 01:13:31.184]  Yeah, well, we think the three things we did are going to help us achieve that goal.
[01:13:31.204 --> 01:13:34.605]  But if they don't, then you better believe businesses are next.
[01:13:34.725 --> 01:13:41.808]  And, you know, that's just... The three things we passed were the easiest things to do, that required the least amount of money from the city,
[01:13:42.438 --> 01:13:44.480]  And if we have to go after businesses, we'll do that next.
[01:13:44.741 --> 01:13:47.403]  Now Farmer's Branch is a big town in the Metroplex.
[01:13:47.744 --> 01:13:48.344]  How many people?
[01:13:48.865 --> 01:13:52.829]  Yeah, we only have 28,000 people, but we are right on the border of Dallas.
[01:13:52.909 --> 01:13:55.171]  I mean, we're known as a first-ring suburb.
[01:13:56.513 --> 01:14:01.218]  Exactly, and I'm just outraged by the fact that
[01:14:02.946 --> 01:14:09.011]  That the illegals flaunt the law in 800 plus cities or sanctuary cities where the law isn't even enforced.
[01:14:09.071 --> 01:14:17.458]  Now, the ACLU and others are already squealing, but they don't really have any recourse, do they?
[01:14:17.858 --> 01:14:18.899]  What are they saying they're going to do?
[01:14:19.480 --> 01:14:28.227]  Well, they're going to file lawsuits claiming that local law enforcement and municipalities are not allowed to enforce these measures.
[01:14:28.900 --> 01:14:41.684]  And I'll tell you, the case law doesn't support what their arguments are, and what you hear from a lot of these groups, they can't argue the issues on the merits, they can't argue the fact that people are breaking the law, so they just resort to a bunch of name-calling.
[01:14:42.585 --> 01:14:49.607]  The good news is, in our city, it seems like from some informal polling that has been done,
[01:14:50.323 --> 01:14:56.929]  And just from the emails, faxes, and phone calls that I've received, it seems like about 90% of the people in our city support these measures.
[01:14:57.230 --> 01:14:57.890]  Now you just said 90.
[01:14:58.030 --> 01:15:01.133]  I've never talked to you before we just got on air, and that's what I say every day.
[01:15:01.373 --> 01:15:04.376]  But the Gallup poll last year said 90%.
[01:15:04.416 --> 01:15:06.318]  The Gallup poll this year said 91%.
[01:15:07.279 --> 01:15:07.959]  That's the number.
[01:15:08.380 --> 01:15:08.520]  It's 90%.
[01:15:08.800 --> 01:15:16.367]  Yeah, and you know, we have people arguing with us that we... But the way we did it was a bunch of volunteers put door hangers
[01:15:16.906 --> 01:15:21.109]  On pretty much every single door in the city of Farmer's Branch, it said, give us your responses.
[01:15:21.669 --> 01:15:28.813]  And we've had over a thousand responses come back, and those responses have been 90% in favor of it.
[01:15:29.234 --> 01:15:32.836]  Man, I wish we had a government in Austin like yours, where the city asks what we want.
[01:15:34.577 --> 01:15:37.238]  And this wasn't officially done by the city, it was done by citizens.
[01:15:37.559 --> 01:15:39.600]  I understand, but still, the city's listening to that.
[01:15:40.040 --> 01:15:46.444]  Yeah, and the support has just been universal, and you would be shocked to come look at my email
[01:15:47.020 --> 01:15:54.547]  list of just the emails I've received from not just Farmer's Branch and Metroplex residents, but from people all over the country, and just the support is overwhelming.
[01:15:54.607 --> 01:16:11.101]  Well, 67 to 70 percent of Hispanics, and again, that's almost all of the citizens, they also poll the quote immigrants, I mean, so if you look, if you break down those polls, the Gallup poll, almost 80 percent of Hispanics who are citizens, it's right at 80,
[01:16:12.402 --> 01:16:17.203]  When you take the illegals out of the equation, are against it too, so it's not some racial issue.
[01:16:17.483 --> 01:16:28.006]  This is America, and we simply cannot take the hordes of people from Latin America or anywhere else for that matter, and we certainly can't have illegals running around all over the place.
[01:16:28.306 --> 01:16:41.589]  You know, our proposals will benefit every single person that lives in Farmers Branch, Texas, regardless of what race, color, or creed they are, with the exception of people who aren't supposed to be here in the first place.
[01:16:42.228 --> 01:16:42.748]  Exactly.
[01:16:42.828 --> 01:16:45.649]  Now, do you have copies of the resolutions you passed?
[01:16:45.709 --> 01:16:49.910]  I mean, are other cities looking at duplicating what you've done, or are they waiting to see what happens?
[01:16:50.390 --> 01:17:05.133]  Well, you have a lot of wait and see, but I've been in touch with four different city officials from different cities in Texas, and I will tell you that the momentum is growing just almost on a daily basis.
[01:17:06.224 --> 01:17:10.485]  Now, I have a few friends that are police officers, and sheriffs have complained on the air.
[01:17:11.265 --> 01:17:15.567]  We've had them on from Tennessean places, where they'll pick up a whole car full of ten illegals.
[01:17:16.307 --> 01:17:18.127]  They'll even find drugs on them, things like that.
[01:17:18.167 --> 01:17:20.628]  They take them, and the feds won't even come get them or deport them.
[01:17:20.908 --> 01:17:21.968]  They have to let them go.
[01:17:23.109 --> 01:17:30.911]  It's illegals are involved in a lot higher incidents of wrecks because of the drinking, and because they've never really had any driver education.
[01:17:31.571 --> 01:17:37.854]  So right there, how can a city like Austin catch and release, but then a city like Farmers Branch do its job?
[01:17:37.974 --> 01:17:41.115]  I don't know how cities don't get sued for not doing their job.
[01:17:41.315 --> 01:17:42.636]  You know, that's a good point.
[01:17:42.796 --> 01:17:59.403]  Alex, I handle injury and death cases at my law firm, and I will tell you, not a day goes by that we don't get a phone call from someone who said they were in a wreck, and they're hurt, and they were hit by someone who was here illegally that doesn't have insurance.
[01:17:59.443 --> 01:18:00.363]  Not a day goes by.
[01:18:01.098 --> 01:18:03.439]  Well, I've been hit personally twice by illegals.
[01:18:04.559 --> 01:18:13.041]  And it's just, it's not just a matter of benefiting our city and raising property values and helping the schools, but it's also a safety issue.
[01:18:13.061 --> 01:18:20.903]  You know, there's so many good, positive reasons to do this, and it really is, it's protecting America.
[01:18:22.103 --> 01:18:23.144]  It's just common sense!
[01:18:23.184 --> 01:18:24.144]  We have to do this!
[01:18:24.464 --> 01:18:27.125]  Well, you know, you're not allowed to have common sense in politics.
[01:18:27.145 --> 01:18:28.105]  That's just not allowed.
[01:18:29.492 --> 01:18:35.276]  I know you're very busy, sir, but I'd like to do five minutes with you on the other side, a quick break, and then five minutes on the other side.
[01:18:35.296 --> 01:18:35.997]  Are you game to do that?
[01:18:36.257 --> 01:18:36.697]  No problem.
[01:18:36.897 --> 01:18:37.878]  Okay, fantastic.
[01:18:37.918 --> 01:18:40.480]  We'll be right back with Tim O'Hare.
[01:18:41.060 --> 01:18:42.161]  He's from Farmers Branch.
[01:18:42.181 --> 01:18:44.282]  He's a city councilman.
[01:18:44.342 --> 01:18:55.410]  Hi, folks.
[01:18:55.450 --> 01:18:57.171]  Jack Browner from Midas Resources.

[01:19:01.815 --> 01:19:03.736]  Let's review a few things from the past year.
[01:19:04.216 --> 01:19:05.216]  November 2003 to November 2004.
[01:19:05.276 --> 01:19:06.677]  The Dow has ranged from 9,800 to 10,300.
[01:19:06.717 --> 01:19:07.137]  A 5% increase.
[01:19:07.737 --> 01:19:10.518]  The dollar's value has dropped from 96 cents to 70 cents against the Euro.
[01:19:10.538 --> 01:19:13.859]  A 24% decrease in spending power against the gold-backed Euro.
[01:19:13.879 --> 01:19:15.339]  Gold has gone from the 390s to the 440s.
[01:19:15.379 --> 01:19:16.379]  A 16% increase in real money.
[01:19:29.295 --> 01:19:32.318]  Precious metals are the safe haven in today's hectic marketplace.

[01:19:56.871 --> 01:20:06.133]  Have you ever wondered what former President George Herbert Walker Bush meant in 1990 by saying the Desert Storm War was a good chance to start the New World Order?
[01:20:07.053 --> 01:20:13.835]  The New World Order would cause us to lose our freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution and also our national sovereignty.
[01:20:14.755 --> 01:20:16.195]  Is this what Americans want?
[01:20:16.415 --> 01:20:19.476]  To be merged into a communist-style one-world government?

[01:21:53.371 --> 01:21:55.012]  Shelly, you look exhausted.
[01:21:55.072 --> 01:21:55.853]  What's wrong?
[01:21:55.873 --> 01:21:57.094]  I am so tired.
[01:21:57.154 --> 01:21:59.615]  I just get so hot at night and can't sleep.
[01:21:59.755 --> 01:22:00.836]  I have tried everything.
[01:22:00.916 --> 01:22:02.677]  All kinds of fans, sheets, pillows.
[01:22:02.817 --> 01:22:03.958]  You name it, I've tried it.
[01:22:04.098 --> 01:22:06.400]  My husband has always been a hot sleeper.
[01:22:06.560 --> 01:22:08.121]  He's never had a good night's sleep.
[01:22:08.341 --> 01:22:10.402]  Then we discovered something that really helped.
[01:22:10.503 --> 01:22:12.744]  It's called the BedFan Personal Cooling System.
[01:22:12.904 --> 01:22:13.425]  The what?

[01:23:11.288 --> 01:23:13.148]  Welcome back, final segment with our guest.
[01:23:13.168 --> 01:23:17.670]  We'll open the phones up and cover a bunch of news in the last 30 minutes here at the bottom of the hour.
[01:23:18.770 --> 01:23:26.272]  Tim O'Hare is a native Texan, also of course a former UT football player, and he is an attorney up in Farmer's Branch also.
[01:23:26.332 --> 01:23:29.473]  He is the Deputy Mayor Pro Tem, City Council Member,
[01:23:30.348 --> 01:23:37.531]  And they've simply said that they're going to do the opposite of what other cities do, saying they're going to be sanctuaries and violate federal and state law.
[01:23:38.011 --> 01:23:39.691]  They're going to try to basically enforce the law.
[01:23:40.112 --> 01:23:42.672]  You know, cities don't have to even pass laws like you've done.
[01:23:43.033 --> 01:23:52.556]  When they pull an illegal over and they don't have insurance, I mean, they arrest citizens all the time for not having insurance, driving recklessly, not having their driver's license, but they don't do that to illegals.
[01:23:53.508 --> 01:24:01.077]  How do these other cities get to the point of basically making the illegal aliens first class citizens and then citizens are second class?
[01:24:02.338 --> 01:24:09.226]  I'll tell you what you have, Alex, is you have people in political office who so desperately want to hold on to their jobs.
[01:24:09.929 --> 01:24:19.302]  When I say what I'm about to say, it's not that I don't love Farmers Branch or like what I'm doing, but if I get defeated in a re-election bid, I mean, really, who cares?
[01:24:19.522 --> 01:24:25.471]  I mean, it's City Council and Farmers Branch, so I don't have to try to make sure that I'm politically correct.
[01:24:25.942 --> 01:24:29.344]  I don't have to try to make sure that I don't upset one particular group or another.
[01:24:29.364 --> 01:24:30.945]  Well, that's because you're not sucking off things.
[01:24:30.985 --> 01:24:36.348]  A lot of people are sucking off the government trough, and so they do want to stay in, too, so you're not sucking anything.
[01:24:36.368 --> 01:24:39.649]  That's always a key indicator that you're not telling a lie.
[01:24:40.010 --> 01:24:52.736]  That's exactly right, and then my supporters are not big businesses who make their money off of illegals where they can get cheap labor, and so I don't have anyone that's backing me that I have to answer to, and I wouldn't answer to them if I did.
[01:24:54.257 --> 01:24:58.078]  But I don't have that to worry about, which is not what you have in the U.S.
[01:24:58.118 --> 01:24:59.598]  Senate or in the House of Representatives.
[01:25:00.638 --> 01:25:02.499]  Exactly, and I've said it over and over again.
[01:25:03.239 --> 01:25:10.260]  We get 60%, 55% turnout depending on the national election, but then we get on average in Texas 8% turnout.
[01:25:10.541 --> 01:25:18.622]  The power is at the county and city and municipal level, and this is where the people can actually get into power and can actually turn the tide.
[01:25:19.402 --> 01:25:22.343]  I think it's almost a distraction to focus too much on the federal level.
[01:25:23.484 --> 01:25:36.415]  Well, what we've seen in farmers' branches, more people have spoken out and gotten involved as a result of this issue than we have ever seen in the history of our city.
[01:25:36.595 --> 01:25:41.299]  And it has inspired people to get involved at the local government level.
[01:25:42.098 --> 01:25:49.106]  And it's just a storm, really, that is sweeping across the country of people standing up and saying, enough is enough.
[01:25:49.526 --> 01:26:00.338]  Mayor of one of the largest suburbs in our area, Plano, which you're familiar with, had a vote in the paper on Tuesday that said, I'm getting a lot of phone calls saying, why can't you be like Tim O'Hare?
[01:26:01.265 --> 01:26:07.050]  And I say that because when one city passes these measures, other people say, hey, finally someone with the courage to do it.
[01:26:07.070 --> 01:26:09.753]  Yeah, it shows change can really happen, and it's constitutional.
[01:26:09.793 --> 01:26:14.176]  Yeah, and they go ask people, yeah, they go ask people, say, hey, we want you to do it, and that's how another city is going to do it.
[01:26:15.177 --> 01:26:15.958]  Well, exactly.
[01:26:15.998 --> 01:26:20.462]  Instead of the 867, last time I checked, that are sanctuary cities.
[01:26:21.522 --> 01:26:23.944]  Now, this had to be triggered by something.
[01:26:25.100 --> 01:26:32.383]  I mean, was this triggered by a massive influx of illegal aliens or was it just informed citizens there in Farmer's Branch?
[01:26:32.863 --> 01:26:35.104]  You know, I would say really it was a combination of things.
[01:26:35.204 --> 01:26:43.627]  It was a combination of just what's going on in the nation, a combination of that along with seeing what a couple of other cities were doing.
[01:26:44.547 --> 01:26:46.928]  Yes, we've seen a large influx in our city.
[01:26:47.108 --> 01:26:52.590]  We've seen property values on the decline or appreciating at a very low rate.
[01:26:53.171 --> 01:26:56.373]  You know, we've seen the reputation of our school district suffer somewhat.
[01:26:56.433 --> 01:26:59.794]  So, it was just a deal where a lot of things happened.
[01:26:59.834 --> 01:27:04.117]  And we also had a two-year-old little girl killed in a drive-by shooting earlier this year.
[01:27:04.777 --> 01:27:08.099]  And the two people that were arrested, the two suspects, were illegal.
[01:27:08.339 --> 01:27:10.800]  And, you know, finally people have to say, enough is enough.
[01:27:10.940 --> 01:27:11.541]  Well, that's it.
[01:27:11.721 --> 01:27:13.241]  Statistically, exactly.
[01:27:13.502 --> 01:27:15.923]  It's not that Mexicans in Mexico are all criminals.
[01:27:16.303 --> 01:27:20.005]  It's that those that come here have a higher level of criminality already.
[01:27:20.814 --> 01:27:27.479]  And so, there are already criminals to be here to begin with, and, I mean, what is it, almost half of LA jails are illegal aliens?
[01:27:27.640 --> 01:27:38.408]  I mean... Yeah, I've seen, what is it, uh, 95% of the warrants in LA County for murder are for illegals, and 75% of the people on the most wanted list are illegals.
[01:27:38.468 --> 01:27:42.151]  I mean, anybody that thinks that's not coming to their city is just blind.
[01:27:43.052 --> 01:27:48.216]  In fact, Dallas had some Los Zetas murders last year where their military drug dealers were killing people.
[01:27:49.735 --> 01:28:01.579]  It's a problem that you're seeing all across the country and I would tell people to take a look at the statistics in Los Angeles County and ask yourself, is this what you want our city or our county to look like?
[01:28:01.679 --> 01:28:02.819]  And no one wants that.
[01:28:02.839 --> 01:28:04.460]  That's why these measures are necessary.
[01:28:04.480 --> 01:28:07.201]  They also tell blacks, whites, and Asians, you can't work here.
[01:28:09.781 --> 01:28:14.423]  What this is really doing is it is suppressing all this huge influx of illegals.
[01:28:14.763 --> 01:28:17.544]  It's suppressing wages for lower income Americans.
[01:28:18.166 --> 01:28:20.928]  Well, uh, just, we've got about 20 seconds left.
[01:28:21.008 --> 01:28:23.270]  You off the top of your head know the Farmers Branch website?
[01:28:23.290 --> 01:28:31.197]  www.farmersbranch.info, but the best place to go is www.supportfarmersbranch.com.
[01:28:31.637 --> 01:28:33.899]  Ah, supportfarmersbranch.com.
[01:28:34.519 --> 01:28:35.920]  Uh, Councilman, thank you, sir.
[01:28:36.941 --> 01:28:37.542]  Hey, my pleasure.
[01:28:37.562 --> 01:28:38.422]  I'll be on anytime, Alex.
[01:28:38.582 --> 01:28:38.803]  You bet.
[01:28:38.823 --> 01:28:39.623]  We'll be praying for you.
[01:28:39.663 --> 01:28:40.024]  Take care.
[01:28:43.526 --> 01:28:44.487]  We're on the march.
[01:28:44.928 --> 01:28:46.429]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.404 --> 01:28:50.205]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:54.245 --> 01:28:56.666]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network.
[01:28:57.186 --> 01:29:00.506]  Let's ask the question that the Bush regime hopes you will never ask.
[01:29:00.866 --> 01:29:03.807]  That is, is the USA already bankrupt?
[01:29:04.087 --> 01:29:10.468]  As the world's biggest debtor nation, we are borrowing in excess of 80% of the world's net savings.
[01:29:10.528 --> 01:29:14.929]  That's $2 billion per day to finance the biggest deficit in history.
[01:29:15.169 --> 01:29:19.531]  Our creditors are becoming increasingly concerned that the debt can never be repaid.
[01:29:19.692 --> 01:29:22.313]  Japan and China, two of the largest holders of U.S.
[01:29:22.333 --> 01:29:25.094]  debt, are looking to greatly reduce their exposure to dollars.
[01:29:25.555 --> 01:29:28.096]  In fact, China has privately hinted that a U.S.
[01:29:28.136 --> 01:29:32.398]  attack on Iran could result in China's dumping massive amounts of U.S.
[01:29:32.438 --> 01:29:33.279]  Treasury bonds.
[01:29:33.559 --> 01:29:38.184]  To find out more about this, call for a free report on the coming dollar collapse.
[01:29:38.385 --> 01:29:40.006]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.
[01:29:40.026 --> 01:29:41.608]  That's 1-888-8-XANADU or 1-888-8-X-A-N-A-D-U and ask for George.
[01:29:52.955 --> 01:29:58.239]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones introducing you to the incredible Berkey Solar Charger.
[01:29:58.439 --> 01:30:00.521]  Your source for free solar electricity.

[01:30:21.957 --> 01:30:27.321]  Multiple adapters and rechargeable batteries provide for flexible source of auxiliary backup power.
[01:30:27.581 --> 01:30:32.585]  Simply place the Berkey Solar Charger in the sun, plug in your application, and you have power.
[01:30:32.705 --> 01:30:37.728]  Disconnect your application, and the system automatically begins charging its own rechargeable batteries.

[01:32:16.377 --> 01:32:17.038]  Welcome back.
[01:32:17.238 --> 01:32:21.522]  Yep, there ain't no Senator's son.
[01:32:40.410 --> 01:32:43.052]  All right, we've got our caller from Vietnam back.
[01:32:43.112 --> 01:32:47.074]  I believe it's Bien, or Bien, I don't know if I'm pronouncing that right, from Vietnam.
[01:32:47.094 --> 01:32:48.875]  Let's go right to you, then Bill, Rusty, and others.
[01:32:49.355 --> 01:32:50.516]  Welcome from Vietnam.
[01:32:50.536 --> 01:32:51.156]  Can you hear me?
[01:32:51.756 --> 01:32:52.837]  Yeah, I can hear you.
[01:32:52.917 --> 01:32:53.517]  Can you hear me?
[01:32:53.958 --> 01:32:54.438]  Yes, sir.
[01:32:54.518 --> 01:32:55.979]  How long have you been listening to the show?
[01:32:56.019 --> 01:32:58.340]  Where are you in Vietnam?
[01:32:58.360 --> 01:32:59.121]  Saigon.
[01:32:59.381 --> 01:33:01.042]  I've been here six years.
[01:33:02.302 --> 01:33:03.323]  Where are you originally from?
[01:33:03.343 --> 01:33:04.624]  Norway.
[01:33:05.464 --> 01:33:06.745]  Oh, wow, so you're there on business.
[01:33:08.197 --> 01:33:08.997]  Teaching English.
[01:33:09.978 --> 01:33:12.478]  All right, so what are you calling about today, sir?
[01:33:13.899 --> 01:33:19.080]  Okay, first I want to say I consider you my brother.
[01:33:19.100 --> 01:33:26.422]  I follow you almost every day and you have my full respect and blessings.
[01:33:26.702 --> 01:33:27.742]  Well, thank you, sir.
[01:33:27.762 --> 01:33:28.422]  God bless you.
[01:33:30.103 --> 01:33:33.904]  Okay, first a piece of news and then a question for you.
[01:33:35.047 --> 01:33:39.450]  Guess who's here in Vietnam training Vietnamese soldiers?
[01:33:40.591 --> 01:33:41.572]  Our military!
[01:33:42.433 --> 01:33:42.693]  Yes.
[01:33:44.294 --> 01:33:50.559]  About two years ago on the BBC, you know, I was very perplexed to see the Prime Minister.
[01:33:50.799 --> 01:33:59.325]  He made an announcement that he had a plan to get American military instructors over to Vietnam to train the Vietnamese military.
[01:34:01.140 --> 01:34:10.088]  I saw that a few years ago and frankly didn't even cover it because I didn't think the listeners could handle it or believe it.
[01:34:10.588 --> 01:34:13.491]  That's the kind of stuff, it's all so insane.
[01:34:14.292 --> 01:34:20.838]  And then I tell it to a friend of mine and he said, yeah, didn't you know that they've been here one year already?
[01:34:22.161 --> 01:34:26.685]  I saw the plan a couple years ago to part of Clinton.
[01:34:26.725 --> 01:34:31.990]  Clinton opened up relations six years ago, but they'd really been operating before that.
[01:34:34.272 --> 01:34:36.854]  But I don't know what the Vietnamese would need advice on.
[01:34:36.935 --> 01:34:40.197]  It seems they know what they're doing when it comes to guerrilla warfare.
[01:34:40.878 --> 01:34:43.981]  I guess it shows the long arm of the new world order.
[01:34:46.241 --> 01:34:52.065]  Yeah, Ho Chi Minh is gone now, so the New World Order takes over one way or the other, huh?
[01:34:52.965 --> 01:34:55.787]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:34:55.807 --> 01:35:06.995]  And now Vietnam is becoming capitalist, you know, because about 1991 they realized that they were running out of money, and so they had to liberalize the economy.
[01:35:07.015 --> 01:35:09.896]  Yeah, they've got lots of Nike plants now.
[01:35:10.757 --> 01:35:11.918]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:35:13.133 --> 01:35:16.816]  And, well, it's awfully, awfully, awfully corrupted.
[01:35:16.836 --> 01:35:21.139]  The rich are getting richer, and the poor, they stay poor.
[01:35:22.340 --> 01:35:23.021]  That's the deal.
[01:35:23.882 --> 01:35:33.509]  I want to ask you, well, with your intelligence on these matters, what do you predict is the future for Southeast Asia?
[01:35:33.769 --> 01:35:36.631]  Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, and Thailand?
[01:35:37.552 --> 01:35:42.516]  It's going to turn into a total police state, even to a greater extent, until the police state's in place.
[01:35:43.214 --> 01:35:50.016]  And then there will be really bizarre super viruses that pop up and start reducing the population over the next decade.
[01:35:50.396 --> 01:35:52.617]  Just like we'll see that in Africa already happening.
[01:35:52.997 --> 01:35:57.599]  What, 35% of the continent has AIDS or illnesses that mimic it.
[01:35:58.414 --> 01:36:04.378]  And that there's just going to be big global slave plantations just like China, just like the U.S.
[01:36:04.438 --> 01:36:04.878]  is going to be.
[01:36:04.918 --> 01:36:12.183]  I mean, it's all the same programs, the same names, the same systems, all owned by the big central banks.
[01:36:12.223 --> 01:36:13.844]  I mean, what do you see happening?
[01:36:13.864 --> 01:36:14.404]  You're there.
[01:36:14.424 --> 01:36:16.145]  I bet you know more about it than I do.
[01:36:16.946 --> 01:36:26.672]  Well, you can say with Vietnam, the worst thing is at the same time the best thing, and that is the corruption.
[01:36:27.745 --> 01:36:35.748]  That is, uh, it's very, very corrupted, so you can never trust the government, you can never trust a police officer.
[01:36:36.148 --> 01:36:50.013]  At the same time, if some police officer, he gets a directive from a superior to do something, well, he might not just do it, if he doesn't want to.
[01:36:51.030 --> 01:36:54.211]  Well, that's the thing about balance.
[01:36:54.251 --> 01:36:57.632]  The old joke is in Mexico, at least you know, you just pay the bribe.
[01:36:57.672 --> 01:37:01.453]  And folks, I've been in Mexico and had the cop pull me over.
[01:37:01.553 --> 01:37:06.335]  I've actually been in a car while it happens, and then the driver just gives him twenty bucks and it's no problem.
[01:37:07.175 --> 01:37:08.375]  That's just how they operate.
[01:37:08.755 --> 01:37:17.078]  Here it's more sophisticated because they keep the corruption at the low level only in certain areas and then basically have a bunch of well-meaning idiots
[01:37:17.498 --> 01:37:18.098]  Yeah, I don't know.
[01:37:18.118 --> 01:37:22.240]  I don't know how you can microchip 80 million Vietnamese.
[01:37:22.260 --> 01:37:28.222]  I mean, running around everywhere, and they are not registered, and the government, they don't know where the hell they are.
[01:37:46.524 --> 01:37:49.526]  I think it's sort of just too chaotic here.
[01:37:49.606 --> 01:37:57.949]  Sure, it's going to be the first world countries where they go, you don't have to have the chip, but if you want the free health care, you've got to have it.
[01:37:58.349 --> 01:38:09.554]  Or if you want that tax exemption for your children, or if you want to drive a car, or if you want to prove you're a trusted... Like Andy Rooney said on 60 Minutes, we all need to take chips to prove we're the good people.
[01:38:10.354 --> 01:38:13.056]  Or what Sean Haddish said, every child needs a chip.
[01:38:13.116 --> 01:38:13.756]  I have him on video.
[01:38:15.134 --> 01:38:16.735]  No, I don't know about Vietnam.
[01:38:17.256 --> 01:38:27.401]  I think the best thing they could do here would just be to put a neutron bomb on us and just exterminate all of us or something like that.
[01:38:27.421 --> 01:38:37.667]  I think it will be very hard to organize this society that is just so extremely disorganized.
[01:38:38.078 --> 01:38:45.722]  Well, a neutron bomb, as you know, folks, doesn't create a heat wave that is destroying life by fire.
[01:38:46.222 --> 01:38:54.607]  It sends out a powerful pulse of intense radiation, killing all life, depending on how powerful it is 100 feet under the ground.
[01:38:56.574 --> 01:38:58.536]  But I don't think they'll use neutron bombs.
[01:38:58.556 --> 01:39:02.518]  When they start calling us, it'll be wave after wave of buyer releases.
[01:39:02.558 --> 01:39:08.061]  Every few years, it'll be the shadowy terror group, Chaos, that's doing it.
[01:39:08.721 --> 01:39:14.364]  There'll be little video recordings that Chaos, or whatever name they give it, will announce on television.
[01:39:15.685 --> 01:39:20.348]  But don't worry, the global government is fighting and routing out Chaos.
[01:39:21.147 --> 01:39:23.789]  Oh, we defeated chaos forces in this country.
[01:39:24.009 --> 01:39:25.891]  Oh, we defeated them in that country.
[01:39:25.931 --> 01:39:28.353]  I mean, that's really the program plan.
[01:39:28.793 --> 01:39:29.974]  And so that's what I see happening.
[01:39:30.715 --> 01:39:36.319]  Well, listen, I really appreciate you coming on the show and I'll call back again.
[01:39:37.460 --> 01:39:38.280]  OK, thanks.
[01:39:38.981 --> 01:39:39.461]  Thank you.
[01:39:40.502 --> 01:39:43.725]  Callers all over the globe call from Vietnam.
[01:39:43.925 --> 01:39:45.966]  Let's talk to Brian in New Jersey.
[01:39:46.006 --> 01:39:47.467]  You're on the air worldwide.
[01:39:47.508 --> 01:39:47.928]  Go ahead.
[01:39:53.024 --> 01:39:55.306]  Okay, Bill in Iowa, you're on the air, go ahead.
[01:39:56.126 --> 01:39:57.707]  Hello, Alex, again.
[01:39:58.167 --> 01:40:00.889]  That's right, earlier you wanted to make a comment, we ran out of time, go ahead.
[01:40:01.109 --> 01:40:03.611]  Yeah, thank you for holding me over.
[01:40:04.732 --> 01:40:14.538]  The guy that called earlier basically answered my question to you about what can we do.
[01:40:14.938 --> 01:40:15.338]  Okay.
[01:40:16.859 --> 01:40:19.441]  Do I have a few minutes or do I have to rush?
[01:40:19.661 --> 01:40:20.502]  No, just go ahead, sir.
[01:40:21.062 --> 01:40:21.402]  Thank you.
[01:40:22.796 --> 01:40:28.778]  Do you know that we have five social classes in this country?
[01:40:31.119 --> 01:40:31.459]  Okay.
[01:40:32.319 --> 01:40:43.203]  Okay, we have the rich, we have the upper middle class, the middle class, the lower middle class, and the poor.
[01:40:44.103 --> 01:40:46.324]  Well, I would say there's about ten groups.
[01:40:47.057 --> 01:41:08.771]  You've got the lower lower class, the lower working class, the higher level blue collar, the lower middle class, the middle class, the upper middle class, the nouveau riche, the wealthy, the super wealthy, the ultra-rich, the elite, and then the money printers.
[01:41:11.332 --> 01:41:13.694]  Okay, well the money printers are the
[01:41:14.454 --> 01:41:22.797]  People that we are fighting against, but anyway, um, yes, I, okay, we, we g-haul there.
[01:41:23.057 --> 01:41:23.417]  Okay.
[01:41:23.837 --> 01:41:25.958]  Pardon my southern expression.
[01:41:26.718 --> 01:41:36.081]  Um, my point is, um, I just got the, uh, another cop.
[01:41:36.161 --> 01:41:41.743]  I've got the terror storm and the, uh, freedom to fascism.
[01:41:42.023 --> 01:41:42.343]  Yes, sir.
[01:41:43.379 --> 01:41:50.645]  Just came in yesterday, ordered it three weeks ago, and man, I watched that Freedom to Fascism.
[01:41:51.305 --> 01:41:53.547]  It just totally blew me away.
[01:41:53.647 --> 01:41:56.770]  Yeah, and let me just add something about shipping here.
[01:41:56.810 --> 01:42:00.253]  People always ask, hey, one time I ordered and I got it in three days.
[01:42:00.933 --> 01:42:02.755]  Another time I ordered and it took three weeks.
[01:42:03.556 --> 01:42:09.618]  What happens is, we got Freedom to Fascism in, and then of course, then it sells out, then you gotta get more in.
[01:42:10.018 --> 01:42:13.919]  So sometimes, you know, it'll take a while if something becomes backordered.
[01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:17.820]  But right now, we are not backordered on anything.
[01:42:18.421 --> 01:42:19.841]  We were backordered on t-shirts.
[01:42:19.921 --> 01:42:20.861]  Those just came in.
[01:42:21.342 --> 01:42:23.662]  So that's why it took you three weeks to get it.
[01:42:23.682 --> 01:42:27.643]  But again, we're not Amazon.com, but they don't have Freedom to Fascism.
[01:42:27.663 --> 01:42:29.464]  We're a small operation.
[01:42:29.504 --> 01:42:30.544]  We try best we can.
[01:42:30.884 --> 01:42:32.425]  But thank you for getting the film, sir.
[01:42:32.785 --> 01:42:33.665]  No problem.
[01:42:33.805 --> 01:42:42.829]  I have several of your documentaries, and I've had to wait just about every time, and I was always glad to get them.
[01:42:43.429 --> 01:42:44.610]  And I share them with others.
[01:42:46.170 --> 01:42:57.775]  But anyway, the thing is here, my point is, like the previous caller asked you, what can we do?
[01:42:58.435 --> 01:43:00.116]  What are we going to do about this, man?
[01:43:02.948 --> 01:43:04.068]  Here's the deal.
[01:43:04.589 --> 01:43:05.790]  It's like the Twilight Zone.
[01:43:06.390 --> 01:43:07.171]  Where was I?
[01:43:07.231 --> 01:43:14.877]  I was looking at people just the other day and I was on an escalator.
[01:43:14.917 --> 01:43:15.737]  I guess I was at the mall.
[01:43:15.757 --> 01:43:16.017]  That's right.
[01:43:16.037 --> 01:43:16.958]  I went to the Apple Store.
[01:43:17.859 --> 01:43:24.464]  My wife was in another store doing something and I was standing there with my son holding his hand and I was just looking at people.
[01:43:25.456 --> 01:43:33.780]  And they just look so into themselves and happy or sad or posing or, you know, striking a pose, what people do.
[01:43:34.700 --> 01:43:36.101]  And I just wanted to warn them.
[01:43:36.161 --> 01:43:39.502]  I wanted to start shouting, hey, there's a global government.
[01:43:39.522 --> 01:43:40.823]  There's criminals in control.
[01:43:40.883 --> 01:43:42.584]  They're incrementally destroying our freedom.
[01:43:42.864 --> 01:43:44.264]  They have very bad plans for you.
[01:43:44.304 --> 01:43:45.605]  They've devalued your dollar.
[01:43:46.633 --> 01:43:48.875]  But they've been conditioned that that would be crazy.
[01:43:48.935 --> 01:43:51.137]  Now, sometimes I get the urge when my family isn't with me.
[01:43:51.197 --> 01:43:51.777]  I will do it.
[01:43:51.837 --> 01:43:52.317]  I have done it.
[01:43:52.778 --> 01:43:54.499]  Or I'll walk over to a crowd of people.
[01:43:54.519 --> 01:43:56.200]  People see me in America and they talk about design.
[01:43:57.021 --> 01:43:58.002]  Walk into a big crowd.
[01:43:58.022 --> 01:43:58.903]  In fact, I'm going to do that.
[01:43:58.923 --> 01:44:01.284]  I'm going to, for the new film I'm making, I'm going to go out and do some of that.
[01:44:02.265 --> 01:44:05.688]  Just start yelling in crowds and warning people.
[01:44:06.688 --> 01:44:08.190]  And really, that's the instinct.
[01:44:08.210 --> 01:44:09.791]  We have to get through the comfort zone.
[01:44:10.976 --> 01:44:12.136]  And we love these people.
[01:44:12.156 --> 01:44:14.017]  I mean, don't we all have that drive?
[01:44:14.037 --> 01:44:14.917]  I mean, I know I have it.
[01:44:15.237 --> 01:44:16.537]  I want to warn people, man!
[01:44:16.557 --> 01:44:17.357]  I want to tell them!
[01:44:17.658 --> 01:44:23.599]  That's an instinct, you know, that goes back to coming back to the cave and going, there's a big cave bear coming this way.
[01:44:23.999 --> 01:44:25.719]  Let's get ready and ambush it, you know?
[01:44:25.779 --> 01:44:33.021]  And then that's what our ancestors would do, was get up above it on the cliff side with big old boulders and heave them down on the cave bear.
[01:44:33.061 --> 01:44:36.902]  That's why we extincted them in northern and western Europe.
[01:44:37.462 --> 01:44:41.485]  I'm kind of digressing into anthropology, but I mean, I've got that instinct.
[01:44:41.546 --> 01:44:43.347]  I saw a big cave bear down by the brook.
[01:44:43.667 --> 01:44:46.650]  It's coming this way, and I run in and go, ooka, ooka, ooka, ooka.
[01:44:46.950 --> 01:44:50.393]  And I mean, I just want to ooka, ooka, ooka, ooba, juba, juba.
[01:44:50.673 --> 01:44:52.594]  I mean, I want to run around doing that everywhere.
[01:44:52.654 --> 01:44:53.635]  I want to run down.
[01:44:53.675 --> 01:44:54.256]  I've done it, too.
[01:44:54.296 --> 01:44:55.096]  Sometimes I have the urge.
[01:44:55.136 --> 01:44:58.399]  I just walk outside in front of the office, and I go, world government's here.
[01:44:58.959 --> 01:45:01.642]  You know, Google Operation Northwoods.
[01:45:02.977 --> 01:45:04.257]  Sometimes I see cameras.
[01:45:04.297 --> 01:45:06.818]  I want to get out of my car and bash them with a baseball bat.
[01:45:06.838 --> 01:45:07.558]  I haven't done that.
[01:45:07.938 --> 01:45:08.998]  I have to control the urge.
[01:45:09.358 --> 01:45:13.259]  I want to, like, go get spray paint at StencilInfoWars.com on every bridge.
[01:45:13.699 --> 01:45:14.980]  I want to do... I can't do it all.
[01:45:15.340 --> 01:45:17.420]  You know, I mean, I want to warn people.
[01:45:17.640 --> 01:45:19.401]  Hey man, don't take the vaccines.
[01:45:19.421 --> 01:45:20.061]  They're deadly.
[01:45:20.081 --> 01:45:22.561]  So really, it's warning people.
[01:45:22.681 --> 01:45:23.941]  They don't know yet.
[01:45:24.802 --> 01:45:30.903]  And so... And, you know, a guy called earlier and said, well, we're preaching to the choir here.
[01:45:31.883 --> 01:45:35.044]  You know, what are we doing here on air?
[01:45:35.384 --> 01:45:36.904]  We need to, you know, go to war.
[01:45:36.924 --> 01:45:39.365]  I don't think he said go to war, but he said we need to do something now.
[01:45:40.405 --> 01:45:49.547]  And so many of the people on the web and other places that are calling for violence, not saying he was, but others are, I mean, if you really start calling for violence, folks, you get arrested if you're not a fed.
[01:45:50.507 --> 01:45:57.989]  And every time I've researched the people calling for violence, that is on an organized platform, using their name, that's not really their name, A,
[01:45:59.142 --> 01:46:04.283]  And then B, and it's normally both of them, they are there trying to provocateur others.
[01:46:04.824 --> 01:46:09.645]  They didn't hurt the New World Order if somebody was to go into a police station and shoot 20 cops.
[01:46:10.165 --> 01:46:11.545]  Most of those cops are good people.
[01:46:12.126 --> 01:46:12.906]  They're ignorant.
[01:46:13.266 --> 01:46:14.826]  They've been given bad programs.
[01:46:14.846 --> 01:46:16.307]  They've been given bad information.
[01:46:16.727 --> 01:46:17.727]  They're malfunctioning.
[01:46:17.787 --> 01:46:18.487]  They don't know.
[01:46:18.507 --> 01:46:21.888]  It would do nothing to blow up every federal building in the country.
[01:46:21.928 --> 01:46:23.028]  The globalists would love it.
[01:46:23.309 --> 01:46:24.729]  They're going to call in foreign troops.
[01:46:25.803 --> 01:46:28.344]  The Globalists plan to have a big civil war here, by the way.
[01:46:28.364 --> 01:46:32.505]  They're going to do stuff so bad, we're going to be forced to defend ourselves, and that's the way it is.
[01:46:33.206 --> 01:46:36.167]  And they're going to love the first wave of our own police and military.
[01:46:36.187 --> 01:46:37.107]  They're going to get shot up.
[01:46:37.367 --> 01:46:38.388]  They're going to get routed.
[01:46:38.768 --> 01:46:39.148]  Boom!
[01:46:39.848 --> 01:46:40.768]  And they may do this.
[01:46:41.249 --> 01:46:43.749]  They could have the illegals riot and bring in foreign troops.
[01:46:44.009 --> 01:46:46.150]  They could have a civil war and bring in foreign troops.
[01:46:46.430 --> 01:46:47.591]  You're probably going to see it.
[01:46:48.711 --> 01:46:52.673]  And the best thing to do, frankly, when that time comes, is be like a porcupine.
[01:46:52.693 --> 01:46:53.893]  You're not out looking for trouble.
[01:46:54.611 --> 01:46:58.733]  You don't want to fill anybody full of lead, but you will defend yourself.
[01:47:01.375 --> 01:47:03.756]  We're in for big trouble, sir.
[01:47:04.036 --> 01:47:05.157]  They are setting it up.
[01:47:05.417 --> 01:47:13.542]  As crazy as it sounds, North Com announced in Army Times three weeks ago, I asked Paul to do an article, but God bless him, he's been too busy.
[01:47:13.562 --> 01:47:15.042]  He writes two a day, so does his brother.
[01:47:15.843 --> 01:47:18.644]  I guess I've got to do it, but I'm trying to make films, do radio interviews.
[01:47:18.704 --> 01:47:21.586]  I think I'll be on air eight hours today.
[01:47:21.826 --> 01:47:23.227]  Eight hours I'll be on air today.
[01:47:24.144 --> 01:47:25.605]  At the end of this show, it'll be five hours.
[01:47:26.985 --> 01:47:27.925]  I mean, I'm exhausted.
[01:47:29.606 --> 01:47:40.409]  So I'm doing everything I can, but the biggest... I notice all the other quote patriots, most of them, they either nitpick each other, tear each other down, or they sit around and strategize all day.
[01:47:41.190 --> 01:47:44.831]  When I got enemies in the Info War coming into the foxhole on top of me,
[01:47:46.835 --> 01:47:48.336]  I mean, I'm literally swinging my musket here.
[01:47:48.656 --> 01:47:50.597]  I'm not waiting for orders from headquarters.
[01:47:51.117 --> 01:47:53.559]  I'm not sitting there thinking about the best strategy.
[01:47:53.739 --> 01:47:55.440]  I am just going absolutely ape.
[01:47:55.460 --> 01:47:57.021]  You know, it's like when you get in a fight.
[01:47:57.061 --> 01:47:58.681]  I'm sure you've been in a few fights in your life, sir.
[01:47:59.042 --> 01:47:59.342]  Oh, yeah.
[01:47:59.702 --> 01:48:01.143]  I mean, back in the past, everybody did.
[01:48:01.163 --> 01:48:01.903]  Nowadays, people don't.
[01:48:02.103 --> 01:48:02.984]  They either shoot each other.
[01:48:03.004 --> 01:48:04.885]  You know, back in the good old days, you got in fights.
[01:48:05.604 --> 01:48:13.389]  I mean, you know, you might be afraid when some big guy's coming down on you, but as soon as his fist... I remember that, boy, when some big guy would... I'd be scared at first.
[01:48:13.409 --> 01:48:14.590]  That's when I was getting jacked up.
[01:48:15.110 --> 01:48:19.573]  And man, as soon as that big fist would crack into me, or as soon as something just... I wasn't worried anymore.
[01:48:19.953 --> 01:48:20.794]  I was on fire.
[01:48:20.834 --> 01:48:22.175]  Tasmanian devil, baby.
[01:48:22.415 --> 01:48:23.476]  I was glad it was on.
[01:48:23.896 --> 01:48:24.376]  And you know what?
[01:48:24.416 --> 01:48:25.217]  That's what we have to do.
[01:48:25.257 --> 01:48:26.057]  Just turn it on.
[01:48:26.297 --> 01:48:27.418]  Just turn it on!
[01:48:27.698 --> 01:48:28.779]  That's what you gotta do!
[01:48:29.079 --> 01:48:31.201]  You gotta turn it on and do those banner hangs.
[01:48:31.421 --> 01:48:32.922]  Turn it on with that spray paint!
[01:48:33.573 --> 01:48:36.835]  I'm just going to... You've got to just turn it on, ladies and gentlemen!
[01:48:37.435 --> 01:48:38.456]  Turn it on!
[01:48:38.756 --> 01:48:39.636]  Get her done!
[01:48:39.916 --> 01:48:41.377]  Make the thousands of copies!
[01:48:41.717 --> 01:48:42.818]  Make your own films!
[01:48:43.278 --> 01:48:47.200]  Buy the guns for the... We have to... Just, just, just... You know what?
[01:48:47.240 --> 01:48:48.281]  Just warn the people.
[01:48:48.541 --> 01:48:49.762]  We're starting to win, sir.
[01:48:50.142 --> 01:48:53.003]  And that's making the globalists really mad, and they're just going ahead with their program.
[01:48:53.684 --> 01:48:53.864]  Okay?
[01:48:53.884 --> 01:48:54.384]  On the air?
[01:48:54.804 --> 01:48:55.425]  Yeah, you're on the air.
[01:48:55.945 --> 01:48:56.685]  Oh, thank you.
[01:48:59.267 --> 01:49:01.588]  My point is...
[01:49:03.686 --> 01:49:14.710]  The only way I see that anything is going to come of this is, is when they take away everything from all of us.
[01:49:16.730 --> 01:49:21.952]  And then everybody's going to have to bear arms and fight.
[01:49:22.352 --> 01:49:23.232]  I know, but did you hear me?
[01:49:23.312 --> 01:49:25.413]  They want us to wipe out the police and military.
[01:49:26.893 --> 01:49:28.654]  The best thing to do is avoid them.
[01:49:30.189 --> 01:49:35.151]  Okay, avoid, it goes into whole guerrilla strategy and a lot of, it's the second wave.
[01:49:35.671 --> 01:49:36.572]  You've got to worry about.
[01:49:36.592 --> 01:49:38.913]  I appreciate your call.
[01:49:38.933 --> 01:49:39.693]  I've got to let you go.
[01:49:40.653 --> 01:49:41.794]  Big news just broke.
[01:49:42.194 --> 01:49:43.495]  We'll tell you about it on the other side.
[01:49:44.495 --> 01:49:45.215]  This is huge.
[01:49:46.056 --> 01:49:46.576]  This is huge.
[01:49:56.318 --> 01:49:59.519]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[01:49:59.859 --> 01:50:01.800]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[01:50:02.180 --> 01:50:09.843]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:50:10.503 --> 01:50:17.566]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:50:17.966 --> 01:50:24.829]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying,
[01:50:25.345 --> 01:50:29.407]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:50:29.688 --> 01:50:33.150]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:50:33.650 --> 01:50:35.551]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:50:35.911 --> 01:50:39.834]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:50:53.095 --> 01:50:53.815]  Terrorism!
[01:50:53.996 --> 01:50:54.736]  Terrorism!
[01:50:54.856 --> 01:51:00.940]  Chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallout, biological attack, anthrax, and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic!
[01:51:01.180 --> 01:51:02.781]  Alarming words for our time!
[01:51:03.021 --> 01:51:05.502]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?

[01:53:03.305 --> 01:53:06.568]  A former member of British intelligence just sent me this email.
[01:53:08.050 --> 01:53:08.630]  We've interviewed.
[01:53:10.712 --> 01:53:15.057]  Security alert as police lose a briefcase of dummy bombs.
[01:53:15.677 --> 01:53:17.499]  This just came out today on a train.
[01:53:18.220 --> 01:53:19.101]  Probably real bombs.
[01:53:19.141 --> 01:53:19.822]  You never know.
[01:53:19.862 --> 01:53:21.143]  Or maybe it's dummy bombs.
[01:53:22.123 --> 01:53:24.824]  And they're always practicing taking them on airplanes everywhere else.
[01:53:24.864 --> 01:53:30.525]  That's what the guys on 9-11 thought they were doing until the nerve gas took them out and the planes were remote controlled in the buildings.
[01:53:31.045 --> 01:53:33.265]  This is a London Evening Standard.
[01:53:33.286 --> 01:53:34.526]  We'll get a report out on this.
[01:53:35.246 --> 01:53:37.106]  We'll put it on JonesReport.com right now.
[01:53:37.606 --> 01:53:43.708]  A major security alert has sparked after police lost a briefcase full of imitation bombs and other devices.
[01:53:44.928 --> 01:53:48.969]  And it goes on to say that this has been going on since October.
[01:53:49.699 --> 01:53:53.223]  The incident was on October 31st, but now they don't know who got the fake bombs.
[01:53:54.144 --> 01:53:54.924]  Yeah, sure.
[01:53:55.225 --> 01:54:01.731]  They're always at... It's like when the Russian police got caught planting bombs in a fourth building, FSB did.
[01:54:02.071 --> 01:54:05.215]  Moscow police caught them and they claimed it was just a drill, but it was real bombs.
[01:54:06.336 --> 01:54:07.437]  Tissue people never end.
[01:54:08.801 --> 01:54:16.144]  Uh, who knows what's really behind that, or maybe one chance out of a hundred that it really was a guy who had fake bombs who works for the government.
[01:54:16.585 --> 01:54:17.225]  Sure.
[01:54:17.765 --> 01:54:22.667]  Hey, here's that old Disney piece from World War II, where they're talking about Hitler and his New World Order.
[01:54:22.928 --> 01:54:27.770]  This is an anti-Nazi film, because Hitler called for a New World Order, so they don't show these anymore.
[01:54:27.810 --> 01:54:28.210]  Here it is.
[01:54:28.950 --> 01:54:30.571]  Is he not the Superman?
[01:54:31.051 --> 01:54:32.712]  Are you not the Superman?
[01:54:32.732 --> 01:54:34.613]  Yeah, he is the Superman.
[01:54:38.927 --> 01:54:40.608]  Would you leave it if you could?
[01:54:40.848 --> 01:54:42.109]  We would leave it if we could.
[01:54:42.209 --> 01:54:44.150]  I order Hitler's World Order!
[01:54:44.190 --> 01:54:47.492]  Adolf Hitler's New World Order!
[01:55:03.917 --> 01:55:08.100]  You see, they use many different phases, many different people, but the program moves forward.
[01:55:08.180 --> 01:55:11.282]  Eugenics Extermination Program for you and your family.
[01:55:12.083 --> 01:55:13.204]  I hope you'll get Terror Storm.
[01:55:13.264 --> 01:55:16.086]  It's still in the top 20 or 30 of Amazon.com.
[01:55:16.947 --> 01:55:20.689]  And I hope that you'll also get Freedom to Fascism at Infowars.com.
[01:55:21.390 --> 01:55:22.330]  Can't get it at Amazon.
[01:55:22.350 --> 01:55:23.211]  You can get it from us, though.
[01:55:23.251 --> 01:55:28.355]  You can get Terror Storm for $9.95 with America Freedom to Fascism when you get it from Infowars.com.
[01:55:29.483 --> 01:55:38.331]  Hey Alex, I'm a first-time caller.
[01:55:38.511 --> 01:55:40.292]  I was also right behind you at Ground Zero.
[01:55:40.312 --> 01:55:41.994]  Channing 9-11 was an inside job.
[01:55:42.134 --> 01:55:44.856]  Yeah, it was pretty insane.
[01:55:45.056 --> 01:55:46.197]  I almost got through yesterday.
[01:55:46.217 --> 01:55:48.239]  I just wanted to make a quick comment about ManCow.
[01:55:49.140 --> 01:55:51.682]  Listen, I think ManCow is an idiot piece of trash.
[01:55:51.722 --> 01:55:54.004]  Hannity-loving, less-than-nothing anti-American.
[01:55:54.366 --> 01:55:56.989]  For him to say that the firefighters are actors is absurd.
[01:55:57.369 --> 01:56:07.020]  I met all these men at the community church in New York, and I mean, just listening to them tell their stories about how they're dying, and you know, it's just disgusting to hear a man like him make an accusation like that.
[01:56:07.100 --> 01:56:07.661]  No, no, no.
[01:56:07.701 --> 01:56:11.325]  That's why we had him on, was just to let him go and let you see.
[01:56:12.246 --> 01:56:13.247]  I know, it's unbelievable.
[01:56:13.307 --> 01:56:14.869]  I mean, these guys are heroes, you know?
[01:56:16.277 --> 01:56:18.558]  Well, the firefighters are heroes and so are the police.
[01:56:19.218 --> 01:56:28.460]  And look, they've got a bunch of lies, we've got the truth, and Mankow is just an establishment lackey, but we're more than happy to get the info out through his program.
[01:56:29.400 --> 01:56:30.860]  Yeah, unbelievable.
[01:56:32.241 --> 01:56:33.681]  Good to have you here, my friend.
[01:56:33.721 --> 01:56:35.141]  Call me back when I get more time, Nick.
[01:56:35.662 --> 01:56:36.922]  Let's talk to New World Order.
[01:56:36.962 --> 01:56:38.422]  Where are you calling us from, New World Order?
[01:56:38.922 --> 01:56:40.503]  Yes, this is on the NWROX.
[01:56:40.543 --> 01:56:41.703]  How are you doing?
[01:56:42.034 --> 01:56:42.254]  Good.
[01:56:42.294 --> 01:56:42.615]  What's up?
[01:56:43.335 --> 01:56:43.896]  A couple things.
[01:56:43.956 --> 01:56:46.898]  First, I sent an email to Kevin and Aaron last night.
[01:56:48.319 --> 01:56:51.421]  One of the biggest news bloggers on MySpace got deleted yesterday.
[01:56:51.461 --> 01:56:52.162]  His name's Andre.
[01:56:52.222 --> 01:56:56.786]  I sent him a cash link to the page and stuff so you guys could make an article or something about it if you could.
[01:56:56.906 --> 01:56:57.826]  Oh, that's a good idea.
[01:56:58.787 --> 01:57:01.509]  I've got a few... I hear the... Oh, is this the end?
[01:57:01.529 --> 01:57:01.789]  Alright.
[01:57:01.930 --> 01:57:02.690]  Yeah.
[01:57:02.750 --> 01:57:06.433]  You've got death row inmates on MySpace on Wired.com.
[01:57:06.453 --> 01:57:07.514]  They're trying to censor them.
[01:57:08.346 --> 01:57:13.208]  Um, you've got, uh, PayPal thinks I'm a terrorist on LiveJournal.com.
[01:57:13.468 --> 01:57:15.369]  These are just articles that I saw you guys have missed.
[01:57:16.549 --> 01:57:20.631]  Um, they, Monsanto, tried to do everything to destroy us.
[01:57:20.691 --> 01:57:22.672]  That's on IndieBay.org.
[01:57:22.752 --> 01:57:23.432]  Hey, we're out of time.
[01:57:23.452 --> 01:57:24.152]  I gotta let you go.
[01:57:24.192 --> 01:57:24.813]  I appreciate it.
[01:57:24.833 --> 01:57:27.494]  Call me back, uh, this Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:57:27.514 --> 01:57:29.415]  Central for the new program.
[01:57:29.455 --> 01:57:30.175]  Be sure and tune in.
[01:57:33.698 --> 01:57:36.640]  Order a copy of this show for your friends and family at GCNlive.com or call 877-300-7645.
[01:57:36.680 --> 01:57:36.940]  Big Brother.
[01:57:36.960 --> 01:57:37.960]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:38.040 --> 01:57:38.801]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:38.861 --> 01:57:39.361]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.093 --> 01:57:56.973]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:56.993 --> 01:58:01.294]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:01.814 --> 01:58:05.915]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:08.635 --> 01:58:11.536]  All right, Pat Buchanan is scheduled to be calling in in the next few minutes.
[01:58:11.756 --> 01:58:16.757]  Last time I had him on, about three years ago, I brought up Bohemian Grove to him, which he said he'd attended.
[01:58:17.457 --> 01:58:19.857]  And I pointed out that I'd been inside it and seen the rituals.
[01:58:19.897 --> 01:58:21.378]  He said, oh, I mean, that's a mistake.
[01:58:21.398 --> 01:58:22.758]  I didn't attend with Richard Nixon.
[01:58:23.929 --> 01:58:26.371]  We have photos of Nixon being there and he gave speeches there.
[01:58:26.971 --> 01:58:29.173]  And so his new book is called State of Emergency.
[01:58:29.213 --> 01:58:30.934]  I don't have him on to attack him today.
[01:58:31.454 --> 01:58:33.476]  I wasn't attacking him when we had him on a couple years ago.
[01:58:33.496 --> 01:58:34.957]  He's been on many times over the years.
[01:58:35.677 --> 01:58:37.999]  But we'll see if Buchanan shows up for the show.
[01:58:38.019 --> 01:58:39.440]  I know he's a very busy man.
[01:58:39.480 --> 01:58:44.403]  He's in Fox News studios right now and is scheduled to be calling in here in the next few minutes.
[01:58:44.443 --> 01:58:48.466]  His new book, already number one on the New York Times best-selling list, State of Emergency.
[01:58:50.156 --> 01:59:14.783]  Now, we have talked about the very popular rock band, Muse, that over the weekend was on BBC Television Live wearing a t-shirt, the lead singer that said, Terror Storm, and when he was questioned about it by the media, he said, just go to Google Video and type in Terror Storm for a real surprise.
[01:59:15.538 --> 01:59:16.638]  And some vital information.
[01:59:16.678 --> 01:59:27.723]  He's since been interviewed by a major newspaper on the subject and is saying that he does believe 9-11 is an inside job.
[01:59:27.743 --> 01:59:32.264]  So let me just read to you some of this out of the Sunday Mail in the United Kingdom.
[01:59:32.624 --> 01:59:33.945]  This came out yesterday.
[01:59:34.465 --> 01:59:39.447]  Mews have cracked America despite singer Matt
[01:59:40.820 --> 01:59:43.061]  Outspoken views on George Bush.
[01:59:43.341 --> 01:59:45.801]  Matt Bellamy's outspoken views on George Bush.
[01:59:46.261 --> 01:59:53.803]  The fiery British trio have rocketed to number nine on the US Billboard charts with their great new album, Black Holes and Revelations.
[01:59:54.443 --> 02:00:03.625]  But Matt, whose passion for conspiracy theories has inspired their songs, has fired a broadside at Wiley O.W.
[02:00:03.685 --> 02:00:04.345]  in the White House.
[02:00:04.385 --> 02:00:06.365]  He said, I'm fascinated by conspiracy theories.
[02:00:06.685 --> 02:00:08.066]  We're surrounded by them.
[02:00:08.166 --> 02:00:09.826]  Boy, you're right about that.
[02:00:11.758 --> 02:00:14.380]  We're surrounded by criminal government conspiracy theories.
[02:00:14.981 --> 02:00:23.449]  Are we really supposed to believe that a man in a cave in Afghanistan managed to orchestrate the most unbelievable attack on the United States of all time?
[02:00:24.204 --> 02:00:32.108]  I think 9-11 was definitely an inside job done by a group of high-powered people looking for an excuse to invade the Middle East for oil and other natural resources.
[02:00:32.128 --> 02:00:35.710]  I think America needed another Pearl Harbor-type event in order to invade Iraq.
[02:00:35.970 --> 02:00:36.570]  It gave the U.S.
[02:00:36.651 --> 02:00:36.851]  and U.K.
[02:00:36.891 --> 02:00:38.972]  governments the perfect excuse to go to war.
[02:00:39.452 --> 02:00:50.798]  I caught up with the singer when Muse and other groups in the band, the printer screwed up and did lines across this, played a sell-out gig
[02:00:51.986 --> 02:00:53.507]  at the Meadowbank Stadium
[02:01:22.552 --> 02:01:30.256]  To just talk about how the band's winning all these awards, but right there in the middle of the story saying they believe it is an inside job.
[02:01:31.436 --> 02:01:33.677]  We are working on getting in contact with these guys.
[02:01:33.717 --> 02:01:36.738]  We were contacted by another big British band over the weekend.
[02:01:36.758 --> 02:01:39.520]  We've been out of town, so we're trying to get them on as well.
[02:01:41.681 --> 02:01:46.603]  This is highly exciting to see so many people beginning to witness
[02:01:47.316 --> 02:01:55.980]  Not just 9-11, but the lies of the Iraq War, the police state, the American Union, all the loss of freedoms that we're witnessing in this nation.
[02:01:56.941 --> 02:02:00.002]  And we are going to continue to stand up for this Republic.
[02:02:00.863 --> 02:02:14.549]  The things that elements of the government, these globalists, are doing are so criminal, so outlandish, so out in the open, they should all be removed from office right now for signing the American Union Pact in March of last year and then expanding it in December.
[02:02:15.750 --> 02:02:16.270]  It's real.
[02:02:17.114 --> 02:02:20.495]  It's happening and it must be exposed.
[02:02:20.855 --> 02:02:22.415]  You as listeners know all about it.
[02:02:22.735 --> 02:02:24.715]  But your friends, your family, your neighbors may not.
[02:02:25.216 --> 02:02:26.336]  Ring the alarm bells.
[02:02:26.976 --> 02:02:27.956]  Give them the evidence.
[02:02:28.596 --> 02:02:30.116]  Let them know what we're facing.
[02:02:30.737 --> 02:02:33.297]  Or we can just decide to let America go under the waves.
[02:02:33.817 --> 02:02:35.017]  The United States disappear.
[02:02:36.518 --> 02:02:37.798]  We're on our last legs right now.
[02:02:38.138 --> 02:02:39.638]  People are rallying to defend the country.
[02:02:39.658 --> 02:02:40.298]  That's the good news.
[02:02:40.598 --> 02:02:41.139]  We'll be right back.
[02:02:48.428 --> 02:02:51.590]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[02:02:51.970 --> 02:02:53.911]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[02:02:54.272 --> 02:03:01.936]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:03:02.616 --> 02:03:09.681]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:03:10.061 --> 02:03:16.965]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying,
[02:03:17.446 --> 02:03:21.487]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.

[02:04:46.371 --> 02:04:51.793]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network, and I have an urgent message for our listeners.
[02:04:52.233 --> 02:04:56.954]  The mass media keeps telling us that we are the richest, most powerful economy in the world.
[02:04:57.354 --> 02:04:59.995]  If this is true, why can't we pay our bills?
[02:05:00.475 --> 02:05:03.876]  Why is the United States the world's largest debtor nation?
[02:05:04.657 --> 02:05:08.998]  The truth is that we are in the worst debt bubble in our nation's history.
[02:05:09.418 --> 02:05:12.599]  When the bubble bursts, will you be able to feed your family?
[02:05:13.199 --> 02:05:16.040]  When the inevitable crash occurs, will you be ready?
[02:05:16.815 --> 02:05:18.956]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.
[02:05:18.976 --> 02:05:21.077]  That's 1-888-892-6238 for the following two free reports.
[02:05:21.097 --> 02:05:21.137]  U.S.
[02:05:21.458 --> 02:05:23.199]  Debt Bubble Red Alert and Real Estate Crash.
[02:05:23.219 --> 02:05:23.499]  Call 888-8XANADU.
[02:05:23.519 --> 02:05:24.419]  That's 1-888-8XANADU.
[02:05:24.459 --> 02:05:25.080]  Ask for George.
[02:05:46.867 --> 02:05:49.069]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:05:49.650 --> 02:05:52.432]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:06.087 --> 02:06:28.421]  90% of the American people in a Gallup poll held during the George Bush financed illegal alien rampages of a few months ago, 90% it went from 87% in polls wanting to control the borders to 90% it backfired all those Mexican flags and then the neocons and the liberals tried to have their PR firms Rob Allen and co.
[02:06:28.441 --> 02:06:28.881]  serve out
[02:06:29.621 --> 02:06:33.246]  Uh, the American flags, but it, the people know they're being lied to.
[02:06:33.266 --> 02:06:33.246]  90%!
[02:06:33.286 --> 02:06:44.721]  And that's, that's echoed by the excellent book, I've now had a chance to read part of it over the weekend, State of Emergency, that I got on Friday, already number one on the New York Times,
[02:06:44.981 --> 02:06:45.621]  Best seller list.
[02:06:45.641 --> 02:06:47.402]  You've got to get a copy of this.
[02:06:47.462 --> 02:06:57.986]  I've seen no chronicle, I've read about half of it, that lays out, page by page, bombshell after bombshell, all documented, because as you know, I'm an expert on this subject, as many of you are.
[02:06:58.066 --> 02:06:58.987]  We cover this.
[02:06:59.027 --> 02:07:00.487]  We believe this is the number one issue.
[02:07:00.788 --> 02:07:03.709]  It dwarfs the quote, threat of international terrorism.
[02:07:04.029 --> 02:07:06.450]  The globalists have signed the North American Union pact.
[02:07:06.850 --> 02:07:08.231]  We are going into it.
[02:07:08.491 --> 02:07:13.773]  And joining us from the Fox News Studios, a very busy man, is Patrick Buchanan.
[02:07:13.833 --> 02:07:17.374]  Patrick J. Buchanan with a new book, State of Emergency.
[02:07:17.394 --> 02:07:20.275]  He, of course, a few years ago wrote The Death of the West.
[02:07:20.315 --> 02:07:23.176]  And we may already be dead, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:07:23.697 --> 02:07:25.157]  Pat Buchanan, thanks for coming on with us.
[02:07:25.437 --> 02:07:27.138]  Well, thank you very much, Alex, for having me.
[02:07:27.941 --> 02:07:41.551]  Tell us, sir, why you decided to write a second book on this subject, and break down the new developments that have happened, and explain to us how this is the state of emergency, the third world war, the third world invasion, and the conquest of America.
[02:07:42.371 --> 02:07:57.022]  Well, I looked at the situation, and as it came up, and we were engaged in this battle ever since last December, and all the way up through this year, and it seemed to me, looking at it, looking at the numbers, looking at what's going to happen if we don't get control of the border,
[02:07:57.540 --> 02:08:04.764]  And if there is a Bush amnesty or a McCain-Kennedy amnesty, I think that we're looking at how America ends.
[02:08:05.344 --> 02:08:21.592]  You take a look at civilizations and empires, and I've studied them, and how they end invariably is when the population ceases to reproduce itself, as native-born Americans are doing, inevitably the great nations are invaded peacefully from foreign lands,
[02:08:22.173 --> 02:08:29.437]  And then you have the decomposition, the breakup, the breakup of the body, if you will, when the soul, which is patriotism, dies.
[02:08:30.158 --> 02:08:49.709]  And as you look at what is happening to America, the incapacity of our leaders even to control the borders, even to control the doors to our own national home, and the magnitude of the invasion, 36 million immigrants here, more than almost as many as all that ever came in our history, and 12 million of them illegally,
[02:08:50.419 --> 02:08:52.601]  Six million tried to get in on Bush's watch.
[02:08:53.101 --> 02:08:58.106]  The Mexican government looking upon the United States as a dumping ground for its poor and unemployed.
[02:08:58.726 --> 02:09:01.869]  A crippling of the third world people not from Mexico.
[02:09:01.889 --> 02:09:05.292]  A crippling in three years of those caught at the border.
[02:09:05.973 --> 02:09:08.235]  These being turned, released, and let go.
[02:09:08.875 --> 02:09:21.714]  I don't see how, Alex, you stop the invasion if we do not stop it cold now with a security fence, no amnesty, and start punishing businesses that hire illegals and cut off all welfare benefits.
[02:09:22.802 --> 02:09:24.263]  Well, you're absolutely right, sir.
[02:09:25.083 --> 02:09:27.084]  There's so many facets I want to go over here.
[02:09:27.124 --> 02:09:38.689]  You mentioned, and you've got the statistics in your book, that we now have in this country as many current immigrants as we had in the 200 plus years before that.
[02:09:38.929 --> 02:09:43.031]  And if they were coming here wanting to join the United States, that'd be one thing.
[02:09:43.511 --> 02:09:47.133]  Most of them are vehemently saying they want to bring down the United States.
[02:09:47.393 --> 02:09:48.913]  They want to reconquista.
[02:09:49.254 --> 02:09:52.175]  I was listening to NPR coming back from Dallas.
[02:09:52.895 --> 02:09:59.498]  This weekend I heard him bragging on Latino USA that, well people don't like it that Mexicans are taking over New Orleans.
[02:09:59.518 --> 02:10:03.379]  Well this used to be Spanish anyways and the immigrants say this is Mexico.
[02:10:03.659 --> 02:10:10.001]  And they were snickering on the program because the liberals of this country hate this country and they love what's happening.
[02:10:11.402 --> 02:10:14.043]  Well a lot of them welcome what's happening.
[02:10:14.503 --> 02:10:17.304]  They are really anti-western culture.
[02:10:18.344 --> 02:10:19.985]  They are in many ways anti-
[02:10:21.070 --> 02:10:22.632]  And there's a hostility.
[02:10:22.652 --> 02:10:29.702]  Remember Susan Sontag made her famous statement, the leftist intellectual, the white race is the cancer of human history.
[02:10:30.243 --> 02:10:36.712]  Many are rejoicing in the fact that the America that we loved and grew up in and we inherited from our parents
[02:10:37.762 --> 02:10:39.524]  That this is disappearing.
[02:10:39.684 --> 02:10:41.025]  It is being inundated.
[02:10:41.326 --> 02:10:43.127]  The culture is being inundated.
[02:10:43.208 --> 02:10:44.809]  It's being split apart.
[02:10:45.350 --> 02:10:49.394]  All of these things people are well thinking under the name of multiculturalism.
[02:10:49.894 --> 02:10:55.340]  But when the culture dies, the unifying culture of a country, the country itself dies, Alex.
[02:10:55.894 --> 02:11:08.718]  Well, Ray Nagin got criticized when he just said, listen, you know, this city's culture is a chocolate city, and we don't like the fact that the majority is not going to be foreigners or openly say this is Mexico.
[02:11:08.978 --> 02:11:10.459]  Ray Nagin's absolutely right.
[02:11:10.819 --> 02:11:15.800]  Well, look, black people are as American as apple pie.
[02:11:15.940 --> 02:11:17.441]  I grew up in Washington, D.C.
[02:11:18.268 --> 02:11:27.850]  It was a segregated city, a southern city, but at the same time, African-Americans or black Americans and white Americans, we were marinated in the same culture.
[02:11:27.910 --> 02:11:34.052]  We had the same teams we rooted for, we watched the same TV shows, listened to the same radio, went to the same movies.
[02:11:34.532 --> 02:11:45.154]  When we went to schools, the schools may have been segregated, public schools, but we studied the same literature, studied the same language, the same history, the same heroes, the same holidays.
[02:11:45.634 --> 02:11:46.755]  We were one people.
[02:11:46.875 --> 02:11:47.715]  If you had called
[02:11:48.567 --> 02:11:54.654]  A black American in those days that were called Negroes, if you called them an African then, you'd have been punched in your face!
[02:11:55.335 --> 02:11:56.817]  And so we were one people!
[02:11:57.277 --> 02:12:03.645]  But what's happening now when you've got, you know, half of Los Angeles County doesn't even speak English in its own home!
[02:12:04.285 --> 02:12:05.305]  We're Balkanizing!
[02:12:05.726 --> 02:12:09.487]  We're breaking up culturally, linguistically, and socially.
[02:12:09.707 --> 02:12:21.391]  I remember 8 years ago, a 10-part series in the San Antonio Express News, written by Mr. Gonzales, excellent pieces, where they went and 7 South Texas towns fought a Mexican flag in the U.S.
[02:12:21.731 --> 02:12:24.132]  No one is allowed to speak English in the court proceedings.
[02:12:24.392 --> 02:12:26.353]  You don't see the ACLU and the feds.
[02:12:26.713 --> 02:12:28.594]  Well, that is a huge, huge part of it.
[02:12:28.614 --> 02:12:36.040]  You know, many of these huge corporations that used to be really proud American corporations that built the weapons that won World War II, now all declare themselves global corporations.
[02:12:53.109 --> 02:13:03.913]  And their ambition is to remove all national barriers and frontiers so they can move people and goods wherever they want to, which they feel is most efficient for the company.
[02:13:04.273 --> 02:13:17.478]  So they put the company ahead of the country, and they genuinely believe that what we need is a global market where these big corporations can move all over the global market, and there's a global government there that runs it all.
[02:13:17.518 --> 02:13:20.759]  This is the New World Order idea, and frankly we're
[02:13:21.630 --> 02:13:25.993]  There is a program, and I write about it in a column for tomorrow morning, Alex, but it's also in the book.
[02:13:26.633 --> 02:13:29.835]  It's the North American Union concept.
[02:13:30.236 --> 02:13:32.017]  Vicente Fox has signed on.
[02:13:32.877 --> 02:13:38.661]  The Foreign Minister of Mexico talks about complete economic integration, or complete integration of the two countries.
[02:13:39.262 --> 02:13:43.885]  The Council on Foreign Relations is talking about the erasure of the borders.
[02:13:43.945 --> 02:13:48.828]  He said the way to solve the illegal alien problem is let them all come in, erase the border,
[02:13:49.395 --> 02:13:53.506]  And have Canada, the United States, and Mexico be one union?
[02:13:54.608 --> 02:13:56.654]  In other words, like the European Union?
[02:13:57.208 --> 02:14:02.389]  And that is to merge with the European Union eventually, into the, if you will, the New World World.
[02:14:02.669 --> 02:14:17.593]  Pat, how do we in the past, you talking about this decades ago, myself for over a decade, we may be called conspiracy theorists, but David Rockefeller published his memoirs two years ago and said, I've been accused of wanting one world government and getting rid of the U.S., well I stand guilty as accused, that's exactly what I want.
[02:14:17.833 --> 02:14:18.674]  These pe-country!
[02:14:19.154 --> 02:14:21.214]  They are out of the closet, that's exactly right.
[02:14:21.274 --> 02:14:24.075]  Walter Cronkite said virtually the same thing.
[02:14:24.695 --> 02:14:41.170]  And folks say that, look, America, what we're going to have to do, we're going to have to strengthen and empower the UN, we're all going to have to surrender some of our sovereignty, we're going to have to have these global institutions, prevent wars by putting down, by being supreme over nations and countries.
[02:14:41.570 --> 02:14:47.095]  What that is, Alex, is an act of wholesale treason.
[02:14:47.984 --> 02:14:53.109]  Against what the founding fathers believed, and what they fought for, and what many of them died for.
[02:14:53.249 --> 02:15:07.143]  Pat, we know, and all the veterans died for, we know that the Democrats are for this, but the Republicans seem to be leading this, even though it's going to lose them control of the House, and maybe even the Senate, or the Senate, maybe even the House.
[02:15:07.543 --> 02:15:32.749]  I mean, we're seeing this unfold, and George Bush continues to try to spin it with doublespeak, saying, oh no, my guest worker program is an amnesty, but you read the plan, as you mentioned, the Kennedy plan that Bush has been supporting, it's blanket, total amnesty, and in the SPP.gov agreement signed last March in Waco, Texas, it says that we're going to have an American ID card in North America, and all the Mexicans and Canadians will instantly be legalized.
[02:15:33.349 --> 02:15:36.730]  Well, that's the instrument by which the
[02:15:37.611 --> 02:15:40.453]  The nations are welded together as the NAFTA superhighway.
[02:15:41.554 --> 02:15:47.739]  Coming up from Lázaro Cárdenas port all the way up through the United States into Canada.
[02:15:48.260 --> 02:15:54.485]  And people don't, they bring the containers in from China and they bring them to a customs port, if you can believe it, in Kansas City.
[02:15:54.505 --> 02:15:59.769]  How are Americans going to like the Mexican government running a large portion of that city?
[02:16:00.697 --> 02:16:08.242]  Well, I think the American people are up in arms, but we cannot get any response from the government of the United States.
[02:16:08.262 --> 02:16:08.843]  That's the thing.
[02:16:09.463 --> 02:16:21.151]  97% of Texans that even just have a small glimpse of what the trans-Texas corridor is, the first leg of the NAFTA highways, 97% of the Houston Chronicle poll are against it, 90% are against open borders,
[02:16:22.092 --> 02:16:25.554]  70% are against the Iraq War, but they don't care!
[02:16:25.634 --> 02:16:28.236]  The establishment just keeps moving forward, Pat!
[02:16:28.397 --> 02:16:32.300]  How do we demand the constitutional will of the people?
[02:16:33.421 --> 02:16:40.106]  You know, the Constitution says, and it's explicit, that the government of the United States shall protect the states from invasion.
[02:16:41.007 --> 02:16:48.493]  Now, if 12 million people here illegally, three times the size of the American army in Europe after World War II,
[02:16:49.446 --> 02:16:55.950]  If that is not an invasion, and six million trying to break in on Bush's watch is not an invasion, I don't know what it is.
[02:16:56.190 --> 02:16:57.531]  But they refuse to do it.
[02:16:57.791 --> 02:17:06.597]  The President himself has said, look, I can't defend the borders unless you give me, basically, my guest worker program and my amnesty program.
[02:17:06.897 --> 02:17:09.939]  And then you won't need to defend the borders.
[02:17:10.569 --> 02:17:12.711]  Then you won't need to because there won't be a border!
[02:17:13.131 --> 02:17:14.352]  Exactly!
[02:17:14.792 --> 02:17:21.597]  If you do not get the border under control now, then the agenda of these people will be realized by default.
[02:17:23.458 --> 02:17:28.822]  They know what they're doing, and Pat, I hear some of the mainline conservative talk show hosts up there spinning it.
[02:17:29.082 --> 02:17:37.948]  They'll talk about the border problem, but then they won't go all the way and explain that it's headed up by George W. Neocon, more liberal than Bill Clinton Bush.
[02:17:38.613 --> 02:17:42.676]  Pat Buchanan, the new book, State of Emergency, with us on the other side.
[02:17:42.736 --> 02:17:44.557]  Stay with us.
[02:17:47.439 --> 02:17:51.082]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson, here for the 2007 Red Book.
[02:17:52.283 --> 02:17:57.106]  The commodity markets like gold, silver, copper, aluminum, and oil have exploded over the last year.
[02:17:57.326 --> 02:18:00.048]  This is a glaring testimony of how quickly the U.S.
[02:18:00.088 --> 02:18:01.229]  dollar can be devalued.
[02:18:02.550 --> 02:18:07.113]  Many have turned to precious metals to provide a safe haven while increasing the potential profits.
[02:18:08.055 --> 02:18:15.339]  Though accumulating precious metals has been a proven method for the storage of wealth, it is important that you understand the market you are getting into.
[02:18:16.320 --> 02:18:19.742]  Midas Resources is offering the Red Book and Silver Dollar for only $27.95.
[02:18:20.302 --> 02:18:24.985]  The Red Book is the number one best-selling guide to gold and silver coins.
[02:18:25.986 --> 02:18:27.266]  Call for your copy today.
[02:18:27.507 --> 02:18:29.388]  It's 800-686-2237.
[02:18:30.768 --> 02:18:36.612]  If you've already accumulated or plan to get into the precious metals market, you simply must have the Red Book in your library.
[02:18:37.319 --> 02:18:39.760]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:18:39.840 --> 02:18:43.362]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:18:45.763 --> 02:18:48.224]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:18:48.925 --> 02:18:52.546]  Have you ever heard of the Genocide Convention Treaty to the United Nations?
[02:18:53.207 --> 02:18:57.088]  Did you know that it's a direct assault upon your freedom of religion?
[02:18:57.769 --> 02:19:06.333]  Did you know that if you mention perverted sex acts as being wrong according to the Bible, you could be arrested and tried for causing mental harm to others?
[02:19:07.316 --> 02:19:14.517]  It's already law in Canada, Australia, Britain, and Sweden where Christians are being tried and deprived of freedom of speech.
[02:19:15.417 --> 02:19:23.539]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[02:19:24.659 --> 02:19:27.160]  Just call our toll-free order line number 1-800-516-8736.
[02:19:27.580 --> 02:19:27.800]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[02:19:35.247 --> 02:19:35.307]  516-8736.
[02:19:35.367 --> 02:19:35.909]  Call now.
[02:19:35.929 --> 02:19:40.020]  Our operators are standing by to receive your call.
[02:19:45.046 --> 02:19:48.049]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[02:19:48.369 --> 02:19:53.293]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[02:19:53.554 --> 02:19:57.917]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[02:19:58.198 --> 02:20:07.126]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[02:20:07.326 --> 02:20:10.929]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[02:20:11.229 --> 02:20:16.255]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[02:20:16.555 --> 02:20:23.302]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[02:20:23.783 --> 02:20:24.324]  What about you?
[02:20:25.069 --> 02:20:30.411]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.
[02:20:30.471 --> 02:20:31.631]  Call now to order at 1-888-803-4438.
[02:20:31.651 --> 02:20:33.532]  Order today and save $14 by calling 1-888-803-4438.
[02:20:45.089 --> 02:20:45.609]  Hey, Emily!
[02:20:45.909 --> 02:20:46.810]  Wow, you look great!
[02:20:47.150 --> 02:20:47.970]  I feel great!
[02:20:48.210 --> 02:20:50.151]  I've been using MediCleanse Colon Cleanse.
[02:20:50.511 --> 02:20:50.811]  Really?
[02:20:51.051 --> 02:20:51.451]  What is it?
[02:20:51.611 --> 02:20:52.051]  How does it work?
[02:20:52.191 --> 02:20:58.633]  Well, MediCleanse is a natural fiber therapy with ground flaxseed, psyllium, and bentonite clay that eliminates toxins from the body.
[02:20:58.753 --> 02:21:01.014]  MediCleanse is easy to use without being intrusive.
[02:21:01.194 --> 02:21:06.316]  You take two tablespoons of MediCleanse powder, mix with water or juice, drink, and it does all the work for you.
[02:21:06.636 --> 02:21:07.097]  That's it?
[02:21:07.337 --> 02:21:08.938]  Well, it sounds so easy and convenient.
[02:21:09.138 --> 02:21:09.839]  It is easy.
[02:21:10.039 --> 02:21:16.685]  Plus, the FDA says flaxseed works to prevent cancer and helps with menopause, weight loss, irritable bowel syndrome, and constipation.
[02:21:16.965 --> 02:21:18.306]  It helps with all of those ailments?
[02:21:18.507 --> 02:21:19.287]  That's amazing!
[02:21:19.608 --> 02:21:24.972]  And, the benzenite clay and MediCleanse eliminates viruses and pesticides in the intestinal tract.
[02:21:25.232 --> 02:21:25.533]  Wow!
[02:21:25.713 --> 02:21:26.774]  Where can I buy MediCleanse?
[02:21:27.214 --> 02:21:30.236]  A one-month supply is available online at MediCleanse.com.
[02:21:30.336 --> 02:21:34.219]  That's M-E-T-A-C-L-E-A-N-S-E dot com.
[02:21:34.279 --> 02:21:37.682]  For only $26.90, MediCleanse is shipped directly to you.
[02:21:37.802 --> 02:21:38.182]  Or call 1-800-317-9547.
[02:21:38.202 --> 02:21:38.402]  That's 800-317-9547.
[02:21:56.386 --> 02:21:57.487]  State of Emergency!
[02:21:57.527 --> 02:22:02.471]  The Third World Invasion and Conquest of America!
[02:22:03.753 --> 02:22:07.596]  We're talking to Pat Buchanan right now.
[02:22:08.697 --> 02:22:13.621]  Pat, again, you know, I am a paleo-conservative.
[02:22:13.661 --> 02:22:20.007]  I don't want to even be associated with George Bush and his gaggle that are basically destroying this country right now.
[02:22:21.762 --> 02:22:27.868]  I know a lot of Americans have woken up now to how bad the immigration problem is and how serious it is to our sovereignty.
[02:22:28.448 --> 02:22:33.534]  But I'm always amazed to then discover, it was even in the Dallas Morning News, it was actually Rob Allen and Co.
[02:22:33.894 --> 02:22:38.979]  that Bush hired to go in and help Fox stage those illegal alien demonstrations.
[02:22:39.019 --> 02:22:40.701]  So we directly have our government
[02:22:41.281 --> 02:22:50.184]  Manipulating and fomenting and trying to use illegal aliens as a foreign group domestically in our country to manipulate our policies.
[02:22:50.224 --> 02:22:54.105]  I mean, that is espionage right there, Pat.
[02:22:54.746 --> 02:22:56.586]  I think the regime is betraying the people.
[02:22:56.786 --> 02:22:58.447]  The regime is betraying the nation.
[02:22:59.427 --> 02:23:02.408]  The American people want their country protected.
[02:23:02.448 --> 02:23:03.829]  They want their borders defended.
[02:23:04.529 --> 02:23:10.411]  And I think the American regime in Washington, both parties, is very much in collusion with Mr. Fox
[02:23:11.224 --> 02:23:13.545]  And very much sympathetic with his agenda.
[02:23:13.985 --> 02:23:14.945]  There's no doubt about it.
[02:23:15.025 --> 02:23:31.409]  I think the only reason the President and the White House are moving along and offering sort of some border fence and the rest of it is because the American people and the people of the American Southwest, from Texas all the way to California, have risen up and demanded this happen.
[02:23:31.809 --> 02:23:37.371]  They're using this crisis, giving a little bit in that area to resolve that, they say,
[02:23:38.012 --> 02:23:42.754]  In order to get their amnesty and guest worker program for the transnational corporations.
[02:23:43.234 --> 02:23:45.035]  I think that is the bottom line.
[02:23:45.555 --> 02:23:55.639]  And frankly, I believe that Senator Hutchison and Mike Pence are working on a plan, which I think the administration, the Washington Post, and others are behind.
[02:23:56.219 --> 02:24:02.662]  Which is basically to say, well, we're going to have border security, but we're also going to have a path to citizenship, no amnesty.
[02:24:03.102 --> 02:24:05.423]  As you say, you know, misleading us all.
[02:24:06.095 --> 02:24:09.119]  And I think if we follow that, that's the end of the United States as we know it.
[02:24:09.380 --> 02:24:10.341]  It's a shell game.
[02:24:11.302 --> 02:24:15.668]  It'd be like if Bush said we'll no longer have murder in the United States, we're just going to change the name.
[02:24:15.708 --> 02:24:18.132]  It's like they changed the name of torture to pressure.
[02:24:18.833 --> 02:24:21.577]  The couple hundred miles of fence and, you know,
[02:24:22.257 --> 02:24:26.840]  A few hundred guardsmen at any one time on the border, not even allowed to bust these illegals.
[02:24:26.860 --> 02:24:29.001]  They've now issued a new order a month ago.
[02:24:29.621 --> 02:24:33.803]  Chertoff ordered the Border Patrol to not pursue illegals above the speed limit.
[02:24:34.084 --> 02:24:35.484]  They're busy tying their hands.
[02:24:35.524 --> 02:24:37.105]  I mean, it's smoke and mirrors.
[02:24:37.605 --> 02:24:38.306]  Well, it really is.
[02:24:38.406 --> 02:24:42.808]  And when you take a look at the numbers, the figures are astronomical.
[02:24:43.629 --> 02:24:48.431]  And the President of the United States, you know, can you imagine that in last year, in 2005, he admitted
[02:24:50.342 --> 02:24:56.429]  That of the OTMs, these other than Mexicans, I think we caught 150,000 of them on the border.
[02:24:56.449 --> 02:25:01.115]  They're from the Middle East, they're from Asia, China, and, you know, Africa.
[02:25:01.655 --> 02:25:03.597]  And everybody knows, nobody knows where.
[02:25:04.178 --> 02:25:07.021]  And all, they were released into our population.
[02:25:07.041 --> 02:25:09.945]  They said, you know, only one in four turned up in court.
[02:25:11.417 --> 02:25:12.798]  What do you expect?
[02:25:13.619 --> 02:25:18.242]  The criminals who broke into our country, they're really going to turn up in court and get booted out!
[02:25:18.722 --> 02:25:19.283]  Well, that's right.
[02:25:19.723 --> 02:25:31.711]  Going back to the Houston Chronicle again, last year they reported that 250,000 in the two years before it was catch and release, that foreigners other than Latin Americans had been released.
[02:25:32.151 --> 02:25:35.673]  Sure, they turned them loose and Bush says, you know, we've got to change this, Pauli.
[02:25:35.713 --> 02:25:39.536]  Here we are, three years after the greatest terrorist act
[02:25:40.091 --> 02:25:51.762]  In America, and you got people coming in, not just from Mexico, but from other than Mexico, Middle Eastern countries, some of them countries are known as state sponsors of terror, and they're being released!
[02:25:52.183 --> 02:25:54.265]  Now how can you say the border is secure?
[02:25:55.057 --> 02:25:56.518]  Pat Buchanan, let's be specific though.
[02:25:56.538 --> 02:26:02.423]  I don't know if you saw the Dallas Morning News back in December, but they reported then that Rob Allen Co.
[02:26:02.443 --> 02:26:06.846]  had been hired to craft the policy with Fox, with the White House, to stage the demonstrations.
[02:26:07.166 --> 02:26:14.572]  Can you specifically speak to the White House being actively involved with a foreign mass to bully the American people?
[02:26:15.273 --> 02:26:22.658]  Well, I think this is, I mean, Fox and Bush have been colluding on this policy since before 9-11.
[02:26:23.991 --> 02:26:24.992]  There is no doubt about it.
[02:26:25.152 --> 02:26:31.236]  Vicente Fox was standing right beside Bush when Bush declared the Minutemen vigilantes.
[02:26:31.777 --> 02:26:33.398]  He is with Mr. Fox.
[02:26:33.738 --> 02:26:39.202]  Now, if you listen to Mr. Fox, though, he goes up to Chicago and he's speaking to Mexican-American citizens.
[02:26:39.242 --> 02:26:40.123]  These are Americans.
[02:26:40.823 --> 02:26:45.167]  And he says, basically, you are Mexicans who live north of the border.
[02:26:45.627 --> 02:26:46.908]  Our country extends
[02:26:47.774 --> 02:26:49.055]  Outside of Mexico.
[02:26:49.155 --> 02:26:52.857]  In other words, Mexicans in America are a part of Mexico.
[02:26:52.937 --> 02:26:54.838]  They're openly declaring war on us.
[02:26:55.118 --> 02:26:57.039]  They are openly declaring, exactly.
[02:26:57.079 --> 02:27:03.803]  They are openly reaching to reclaim the allegiance of American citizens who have taken an oath of allegiance to the United States.
[02:27:04.223 --> 02:27:07.725]  They are pushing Mexican people into the United States.
[02:27:07.765 --> 02:27:09.146]  They are aiding and abetting them.
[02:27:09.466 --> 02:27:10.867]  They are calling them heroes.
[02:27:11.267 --> 02:27:17.970]  They have an agenda to make dual citizenship, Mexicans and Americans, so they get influence and control over U.S.
[02:27:18.390 --> 02:27:19.291]  wealth and U.S.
[02:27:19.371 --> 02:27:20.311]  foreign policy.
[02:27:20.831 --> 02:27:27.214]  And the President of the United States is either oblivious to it, but in any event, he has done nothing at all about it.
[02:27:27.514 --> 02:27:30.175]  Well, Pat Buchanan, we'll come right back with another segment.
[02:27:30.615 --> 02:27:32.376]  I want to get into the CFR plan.
[02:27:32.416 --> 02:27:33.737]  We know who's pulling the strings.
[02:27:35.718 --> 02:27:36.618]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.078 --> 02:27:38.599]  The empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.611 --> 02:27:42.372]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:47.675 --> 02:27:51.797]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass?
[02:27:52.037 --> 02:27:53.798]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[02:27:54.058 --> 02:28:00.341]  If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough, the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[02:28:00.641 --> 02:28:06.764]  Using this similar principle, Royal Raymond Rife discovered that diseased organisms can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[02:28:07.004 --> 02:28:08.845]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument
[02:28:09.125 --> 02:28:09.406]  I think.
[02:28:32.789 --> 02:28:35.771]  For more information call BioSolutions toll free 1-866-885-6625 That's 1-866-885-6625 1-866-885-6625
[02:28:45.558 --> 02:28:50.783]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[02:28:50.923 --> 02:28:59.030]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[02:28:59.270 --> 02:29:06.336]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[02:29:06.476 --> 02:29:07.417]  We're good to go!
[02:29:33.698 --> 02:29:34.019]  We're good.
[02:29:44.983 --> 02:29:49.745]  Times are tough right now, but there are a lot of different ways to get ourselves out of this mess.
[02:29:49.986 --> 02:29:53.968]  Providing for our own food, water, and power are a good start.
[02:29:54.228 --> 02:30:00.531]  As you may have heard by now, Ken's Solar has been configuring alternative energy packages for over a decade.
[02:30:00.771 --> 02:30:05.153]  One of Ken's most popular items right now is the new solar-powered generator.
[02:30:05.353 --> 02:30:10.616]  For a lot less than you'd expect, this portable system can chop up nearly a third of your electric bill.
[02:30:10.896 --> 02:30:16.399]  Getting yourself onto solar power is one of the most liberating things you can do for yourself and your family.
[02:30:16.579 --> 02:30:24.323]  The solar-powered generator will run your lights, fan, electric blanket, your refrigerator, and a whole slew of household items.

[02:30:49.034 --> 02:30:55.077]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:30:55.477 --> 02:30:58.599]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:31:01.309 --> 02:31:04.332]  Pat Buchanan's been gracious enough to spend the rest of the hour with us.
[02:31:04.752 --> 02:31:11.537]  I may even try at the end of this long segment, take a few calls specifically on the LaRica and Keys to the Open Borders, the North American Union.
[02:31:11.577 --> 02:31:12.698]  Toll-free number to join us 1-800-259-9231.
[02:31:17.106 --> 02:31:19.127]  First-time callers, I'd like to hear from them as well.
[02:31:19.147 --> 02:31:19.647]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:31:20.308 --> 02:31:25.510]  I want to play just the first minute of a CNN clip from about two months ago.
[02:31:26.130 --> 02:31:33.413]  This is where Lou Dobbs, very credible, highly respected, is talking about the end of America.
[02:31:33.453 --> 02:31:34.134]  Play a clip of that.
[02:31:34.714 --> 02:31:43.998]  The Bush administration's open borders policy and its decision to ignore the enforcement of this country's immigration laws is part of a broader agenda.
[02:31:44.850 --> 02:31:48.937]  President Bush signed a formal agreement that will end the United States as we know it.
[02:31:49.698 --> 02:31:52.422]  And he took the step without approval from either the U.S.
[02:31:52.462 --> 02:31:55.126]  Congress or the people of the United States.
[02:31:56.008 --> 02:31:56.989]  Bill Tucker reports.
[02:32:00.031 --> 02:32:09.875]  So, there's Lou Dobbs stating what you're stating, because anybody who's read the SPP agreements, anybody who's seen this, this is the North American Union, this is globalism.
[02:32:10.375 --> 02:32:17.898]  I've got the CFR report they put out last year that was then written into this executive agreement that bypasses Congress.
[02:32:17.978 --> 02:32:20.479]  It's a treaty without, I guess, ratification.
[02:32:21.264 --> 02:32:22.646]  For this North American Union.
[02:32:23.426 --> 02:32:25.428]  Pat, let's talk about the people above this.
[02:32:25.468 --> 02:32:29.172]  The Council on Foreign Relations openly saying this is about global government.
[02:32:29.472 --> 02:32:31.654]  And then the Minions at the lower level.
[02:32:32.115 --> 02:32:32.535]  Why?
[02:32:32.815 --> 02:32:34.877]  And folks, the Larica and Kista crowd.
[02:32:35.018 --> 02:32:38.541]  I mean, they openly say that they want to kill all the whites.
[02:32:39.061 --> 02:32:41.444]  The big UT Chicano Studies professor.
[02:32:41.924 --> 02:32:46.508]  Up at UT Dallas, Arlington openly says all whites must be killed.
[02:32:46.788 --> 02:32:47.829]  Plan of San Diego.
[02:32:47.869 --> 02:32:48.629]  I have him on tape.
[02:32:48.669 --> 02:32:49.690]  We can play it if we have time.
[02:32:49.710 --> 02:32:51.071]  We've played it many times here for you.
[02:32:51.091 --> 02:32:54.013]  It's on the website, PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[02:32:54.313 --> 02:32:54.834]  Imagine!
[02:32:55.334 --> 02:32:56.675]  And the number isn't 12 million folks.
[02:32:56.735 --> 02:32:59.838]  It's more like 30 million illegal aliens in this country right now.
[02:33:00.498 --> 02:33:05.622]  Groups openly saying they want to kill Americans, openly calling blacks Mayottas.
[02:33:06.062 --> 02:33:07.223]  They are the minority.
[02:33:07.303 --> 02:33:10.705]  As you said, Hispanic Americans were very patriotic or upset about this.
[02:33:11.065 --> 02:33:13.306]  Fox chastises them and says, you're Mexicans.
[02:33:13.666 --> 02:33:16.808]  So let's talk about those above and then those below.
[02:33:16.868 --> 02:33:22.871]  This perfect storm that if we don't clamp down on it now and force this elite to stop, the country's gone.
[02:33:22.891 --> 02:33:23.352]  Pat Buchanan?
[02:33:23.672 --> 02:33:26.173]  Well, this is what I call the Aslan plot.
[02:33:26.533 --> 02:33:28.735]  It's got a number of themes at different levels.
[02:33:29.395 --> 02:33:34.638]  At the ultra level, at the high level, you've got Vicente Fox and his foreign ministers and others talking about
[02:33:35.171 --> 02:33:42.936]  European Union, a merger, the complete integration of the two countries, a merger of the two countries, an erasure of the borders, a European Union.
[02:33:43.317 --> 02:33:55.044]  You've got the Council on Foreign Relations, Dr. Robert Pasteur, testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, a panel of that committee, and said the way to solve this problem of illegal immigration is simple.
[02:33:55.525 --> 02:34:00.548]  We erase the American border at the Rio Grande, we erase the border with Canada,
[02:34:01.181 --> 02:34:01.482]  We're
[02:34:17.774 --> 02:34:21.737]  Transferring wealth to Mexico City and Mexicans giving free run to the United States.
[02:34:21.757 --> 02:34:32.083]  By the way, that's in the plan to use the toll road money to pay for building roads in Mexico so they can pump even more of the third world population that doubles every 35 years.
[02:34:32.283 --> 02:34:33.744]  I mean, this is amazing.
[02:34:33.924 --> 02:34:40.068]  And they still have a continental security force made up of US, Mexicans and Canadians all the way around our border.
[02:34:40.448 --> 02:34:42.690]  And we're talking about foreign troops in America.
[02:34:43.090 --> 02:34:56.936]  Well, you're talking also about, look, 46% of the people of Mexico say they would like to live here, so you would automatically get, I mean, that's almost 50 million people, you would get a huge influx of tens of millions of Mexicans into the United States.
[02:34:57.577 --> 02:35:01.919]  In addition to that, 58% of all Mexicans believe the American Southwest belongs to them anyhow.
[02:35:01.939 --> 02:35:03.179]  28% say it's American, 14% don't know.
[02:35:09.429 --> 02:35:15.012]  Seventy-five percent of Mexicans now believe all Americans, or white Americans, are all racist.
[02:35:15.432 --> 02:35:22.276]  When they have games, soccer games, in Mexico, and the Mexicans score, they chant, Osama, Osama.
[02:35:22.817 --> 02:35:32.782]  And you've got this, that's, at the one level, you've got the very high thing working between Vicente Fox and Bush, Council on Foreign Relations, Kennedy, McCain, at that level.
[02:35:33.122 --> 02:35:37.625]  But there's a different level as well, and you quoted that one individual, in the barrios,
[02:35:38.021 --> 02:35:44.302]  You find the Mecha is very, very popular among radical Mexican and Hispanic students.
[02:35:44.342 --> 02:35:48.423]  They talk about the bronze continent, the bronze culture, and the bronze people.
[02:35:48.483 --> 02:35:49.864]  This is our continent.
[02:35:49.924 --> 02:35:50.644]  It's not yours.
[02:35:50.684 --> 02:35:51.624]  You go back to Europe.
[02:35:52.124 --> 02:35:54.685]  It is extremely militant.
[02:35:55.105 --> 02:35:57.285]  It's the voice of La Mecha.
[02:35:57.665 --> 02:35:58.686]  It is anti-white.
[02:35:58.726 --> 02:35:59.766]  It is anti-Jewish.
[02:36:00.365 --> 02:36:10.067]  And it talks about, you know, this land in the American Southwest is the original Aztlan, from which the Aztecs came to take over Mexico, and we're taking it back.
[02:36:10.587 --> 02:36:18.608]  And then you've got the consuls and the intellectuals and the others who talk about the Reconquista.
[02:36:18.888 --> 02:36:20.408]  We're reconquering the Southwest.
[02:36:20.488 --> 02:36:21.249]  It is peaceful.
[02:36:21.509 --> 02:36:25.889]  They talk about this magnificent project that's underway, the Reconquista.
[02:36:25.949 --> 02:36:30.070]  And the truth is, native-born Americans are leaving California.
[02:36:30.592 --> 02:36:35.641]  As the Hispanics and Chicanos pour in, native-born Californians are leaving.
[02:36:36.002 --> 02:36:37.424]  They're moving over the mountains.
[02:36:37.444 --> 02:36:39.288]  They're going to Idaho and Colorado.
[02:36:39.855 --> 02:36:47.398]  In Arizona, the white population not only declines as a share of the population, but in real terms, it is falling.
[02:36:47.458 --> 02:36:51.179]  For the first time since the Spanish Game, they're leaving California.
[02:36:51.619 --> 02:37:03.864]  Now you can project these trends out to the middle of the century... But Pat, Pat, and I want to talk about those trends, and this is a key point you just brought up, but I want to go back and get that first statement commented on.
[02:37:04.662 --> 02:37:25.577]  I mean, I have a CD here with hundreds of clips of professors and top leaders saying, we are going to kill you, all whites must be killed, and the media covers this up and universities finance this, and then they also chortle and laugh and say the whites are all dying, ha ha ha.
[02:37:25.918 --> 02:37:27.559]  I've got that quote in my book.
[02:37:27.659 --> 02:37:29.260]  If they're not having babies, they're
[02:37:29.724 --> 02:37:32.265]  You know, crapping in their pants and all this other stuff.
[02:37:32.665 --> 02:37:42.007]  You've got all this kind of talk you get, and all these rants and things, most of them in my book, these are the people who, as I say, are the wild men of the barrios.
[02:37:42.607 --> 02:37:56.590]  And they're more and more militant, and more and more hostile, and more and more chauvinistic, if you will, for their culture and the mestizo and the Amerindian populations.
[02:37:56.951 --> 02:37:58.771]  And it is very much a racial thing.
[02:38:00.379 --> 02:38:01.340]  Well, they tell you it is.
[02:38:01.380 --> 02:38:02.982]  I mean, it's like the Ku Klux Klan.
[02:38:03.022 --> 02:38:04.563]  I mean, it's the exact same thing.
[02:38:04.843 --> 02:38:14.353]  Exactly, only the Ku Klux Klan doesn't have, can't get out 500,000 or a million people to march in Los Angeles under foreign flags in a matter of days.
[02:38:15.754 --> 02:38:37.914]  Well, we have our government run by the globalists telling us, don't love the US, don't be patriotic, and at the same time, I was up in Canada during the World Cup, and there were Mexicans running around with huge flags in the streets, wild-eyed, screaming La Reconquista, and saying, I mean, I'm there covering Bilderberg Group, Pat, and there are people running past the Parliament with Mexican flags, saying Canada belongs to Mexico.
[02:38:40.805 --> 02:38:43.789]  I think even the Spanish didn't get that far up.
[02:38:44.790 --> 02:38:47.073]  The Canadians better wake up, I'll tell you that, Alex.
[02:38:47.493 --> 02:38:48.314]  Well, exactly.
[02:38:48.334 --> 02:38:54.702]  They've got 25% of their population now, or close to that, is foreign-born, which is even higher than the United States.
[02:38:57.250 --> 02:38:59.490]  The five-year census just came out.
[02:38:59.550 --> 02:39:03.231]  New York Times reported 60-plus percent of New York is foreign-born.
[02:39:03.571 --> 02:39:04.991]  Most of those are illegal aliens.
[02:39:05.371 --> 02:39:09.532]  Most major cities are over half illegal alien or foreigners.
[02:39:10.872 --> 02:39:17.994]  I wonder why the Loricon Keystone Mexicans think Mexico is so good when they're one of the most corrupt, despotic systems anywhere.
[02:39:18.414 --> 02:39:23.455]  You know, you ought to say to them, look, you love the country so much you march under its flags.
[02:39:23.935 --> 02:39:25.275]  Go back to the country you love.
[02:39:25.976 --> 02:39:28.718]  I mean, if it's that great a country, why did you leave it and come here?
[02:39:28.738 --> 02:39:37.524]  And the truth is, they know they've got a corrupt regime and a failed regime, and I will say, the Mexican people are hard-working people, and they've not been rewarded.
[02:39:37.564 --> 02:39:45.349]  They've been robbed again and again by their governments, which devalue their currency, in effect robbing the Mexican folks of their savings.
[02:39:45.700 --> 02:39:48.562]  They've got an income down there of about 15% of what we get.
[02:39:49.062 --> 02:39:57.608]  I understand why they're coming, but the point is, this is our home, this is our country, and they are not Americans, and they do not belong here.
[02:39:57.768 --> 02:40:01.651]  Well, Pat Buchanan, I want to talk about solutions to fight this, but you just brought up a central thing.
[02:40:02.011 --> 02:40:13.579]  I have a lot of Hispanic friends, hard-working, good, pro-family people, that even the liberal social engineering hasn't been able to break up their families and give them, you know, 90% of legitimacy like the poor black folks and 35% like the whites now.
[02:40:15.780 --> 02:40:22.084]  So you've got the wild men of the barrios, as you say, being given county, state, federal funding, Ford Foundation money.
[02:40:22.464 --> 02:40:30.548]  The elite, the CFR elite, you've talked about, paid for the comic books and the textbooks in Mexico, going back 30 years ago, saying that the Southwest belongs to Mexico.
[02:40:31.028 --> 02:40:33.790]  And so they know exactly what they're doing.
[02:40:34.090 --> 02:40:39.573]  They're coming in and trying to turn the Mexicans, as soon as they get here, into American haters.
[02:40:39.813 --> 02:40:41.854]  So it goes right back to the CFR.
[02:40:42.154 --> 02:40:43.435]  How do we stop these people?
[02:40:44.259 --> 02:40:48.403]  Well, this is the time I must say, Alex, you've almost got me stumped here.
[02:40:48.423 --> 02:40:58.012]  Look, when you get up in politics, you find when you get 70 or 80 percent of the people with you, the politicians for their own survival tend to move.
[02:40:58.652 --> 02:40:59.613]  But they're not moving.
[02:40:59.633 --> 02:41:02.055]  They're holding out and something's stopping them.
[02:41:02.436 --> 02:41:06.119]  And the only thing I think that is that powerful is the K Street powers.
[02:41:06.699 --> 02:41:08.361]  All that money are saying, look,
[02:41:09.253 --> 02:41:21.056]  In the Senate bill, there is a complete blanket pardon from all civil and criminal penalties for all businesses that hired illegals, as well as an amnesty for almost all the 12 million here.
[02:41:21.476 --> 02:41:27.698]  And I think behind this, holding up a tough border security bill only,
[02:41:28.109 --> 02:41:33.290]  Holding that up, I think, are the corporations, because they've got the biggest stake in this thing.
[02:41:33.690 --> 02:41:38.331]  They've got their guys at risk, a lot of these businessmen that hire people regularly.
[02:41:38.632 --> 02:41:40.492]  They pay the tuition of both parties.
[02:41:40.792 --> 02:41:48.694]  That seems to me to be the one big power that is behind the administration and the Congress refusing to act.
[02:41:50.394 --> 02:41:51.775]  Pat Buchanan, I agree with you.
[02:41:54.088 --> 02:41:58.149]  You were trying to get to the point about where we're going to be by 2050 if this continues.
[02:41:58.850 --> 02:42:09.053]  Well, I think it's... Look, if you don't stop it now, you're going to have the Native... I mean, the Americans of European descent will be well under 50% of the population shrinking.
[02:42:09.133 --> 02:42:12.474]  We will have... Most of them will have moved away from the major cities of the country.
[02:42:12.954 --> 02:42:15.035]  Los Angeles will look like Mexico City.
[02:42:15.475 --> 02:42:18.076]  The cities of Texas... Well, it already does.
[02:42:18.096 --> 02:42:18.796]  What are you talking about?
[02:42:18.896 --> 02:42:19.756]  Well, it already does.
[02:42:19.976 --> 02:42:21.677]  But I'll tell you, the cities of Texas will...
[02:42:22.401 --> 02:42:31.992]  Every city in America will look like Los Angeles today, and Los Angeles and the cities in the Southwest will look like Tijuana, Mexico City, and those cities like that.
[02:42:32.072 --> 02:42:33.694]  And it's inevitable.
[02:42:33.734 --> 02:42:34.855]  I mean, a hundred million?
[02:42:35.636 --> 02:42:37.258]  Hispanics, that's not Pat Buchanan.
[02:42:37.278 --> 02:42:39.120]  That's the Census Bureau.
[02:42:39.280 --> 02:42:40.682]  102 million Hispanics in the U.S.
[02:42:41.528 --> 02:42:43.271]  Twenty-five percent of the population by 2050.
[02:42:43.431 --> 02:42:47.576]  And our government... Twenty million concentrated in the Southwest.
[02:42:47.737 --> 02:42:53.144]  And our government financing the groups to make sure they hate the United States because they want to break up the U.S.
[02:42:53.184 --> 02:42:54.025]  and have an American Union.
[02:42:54.045 --> 02:42:54.686]  Look, it's simple.
[02:42:54.986 --> 02:42:56.008]  The globalists have told us.
[02:42:57.149 --> 02:43:01.235]  The middle class in this country was predominantly Chinese.
[02:43:02.637 --> 02:43:05.240]  The government would be waging war against them.
[02:43:05.681 --> 02:43:10.848]  The elites never want middle classes where you have upward mobility and where people aren't dependent on the government.
[02:43:12.270 --> 02:43:15.493]  I've not seen numbers that high, but I will say this.
[02:43:15.553 --> 02:43:16.473]  I do believe that the
[02:43:40.290 --> 02:43:48.237]  The American middle and working class of this country, as I wrote in the title of an earlier book, are victims of a great betrayal.
[02:43:48.817 --> 02:43:51.780]  Their manufacturing jobs are being sent abroad.
[02:43:52.020 --> 02:43:55.063]  Illegal aliens are coming, being invited into their country.
[02:43:56.023 --> 02:44:01.288]  The products of China and things like that are pouring in, and American jobs are being lost.
[02:44:01.758 --> 02:44:10.766]  They're bringing in H-1B's or bright young Indian kids or kids from Bangladesh to take the jobs of Americans who are no longer in the defense industries.
[02:44:11.166 --> 02:44:13.208]  The middle class is under assault.
[02:44:13.268 --> 02:44:24.018]  You saw today where the median income of Americans, despite rising productivity, has fallen 2% since 2003 when the so-called Bush recovery happened.
[02:44:24.768 --> 02:44:32.231]  The middle class is falling behind, and the boys with the portfolios and the boys in the boardrooms are doing just fine.
[02:44:33.832 --> 02:44:38.714]  Well, they are, and so this is really an elite, waging war on the population.
[02:44:39.094 --> 02:44:48.397]  It is an elite, basically dismissing the interests and concerns, and frankly, the great concern of the middle class, they love the country.
[02:44:48.878 --> 02:44:49.718]  They love America.
[02:44:50.433 --> 02:44:52.253]  And the elites don't really care about that.
[02:44:52.273 --> 02:44:55.154]  They look upon the American people as consumers.
[02:44:55.194 --> 02:44:56.374]  They're all consumers.
[02:44:56.494 --> 02:44:58.895]  Pat, what are some solutions to this fight?
[02:44:58.915 --> 02:44:59.655]  How do we twist?
[02:44:59.675 --> 02:45:00.675]  I mean, he worked in the White House.
[02:45:00.995 --> 02:45:02.755]  How do we twist Bush's arm?
[02:45:03.035 --> 02:45:04.376]  How do we twist the Democrats' arms?
[02:45:04.696 --> 02:45:07.736]  How do we demand that they build a continuous wall?
[02:45:08.116 --> 02:45:10.757]  How do we demand that we start massive deportations?
[02:45:11.037 --> 02:45:17.498]  How do we demand that we start charging people with felonies who hire large groups of illegal aliens to work in their factories?
[02:45:18.058 --> 02:45:25.262]  I think you're going to have to encourage folks at the state and local level to take action against illegal aliens and be very, very tough on it.
[02:45:25.622 --> 02:45:28.083]  This will keep the issue in front of these people, frankly.
[02:45:28.103 --> 02:45:33.446]  And then, come November, I think you go up to them and say, look, I don't care what you've done for me in the past.
[02:45:34.006 --> 02:45:35.267]  You vote for amnesty.
[02:45:35.347 --> 02:45:36.888]  You vote for the guest worker program.
[02:45:37.518 --> 02:45:44.761]  And you oppose a security fence along the border, and I'm going to vote against you, and I'm going to work against you, and we're going to defeat you.
[02:45:44.781 --> 02:45:46.682]  And if you're a Republican, too bad.
[02:45:46.702 --> 02:45:50.863]  We'll maybe get in Republicans who believe more in preserving this country.
[02:45:51.224 --> 02:45:51.844]  That is it.
[02:45:51.944 --> 02:45:52.904]  This is the ballot.
[02:45:53.324 --> 02:45:57.326]  This is the single vote on which we're going to hold you accountable.
[02:45:58.769 --> 02:46:06.537]  And I think that, I mean, obviously the establishment's got to know that if things are already this heated in 2006, what's it going to be like in 5, 10 years?
[02:46:06.597 --> 02:46:12.482]  I mean, this is going to get... This book of mine, I'll tell you, the book is, you know, The Third World Invasion and Conquest of America.
[02:46:12.943 --> 02:46:14.424]  This issue is going to be here in 2006, 2008, 2010.
[02:46:17.614 --> 02:46:19.335]  Because the whole world is coming.
[02:46:19.695 --> 02:46:21.095]  They're coming to that southern border.
[02:46:21.115 --> 02:46:22.636]  The Mexicans aren't going to stop coming.
[02:46:22.836 --> 02:46:24.897]  They're not going to stop being pushed into the country.
[02:46:25.057 --> 02:46:26.918]  There's six billion people that want to come here.
[02:46:27.778 --> 02:46:28.919]  We can't have them all here.
[02:46:29.419 --> 02:46:32.760]  Folks, you don't want to live like they do in India or they do in Mexico City.
[02:46:32.800 --> 02:46:33.440]  Travel there.
[02:46:33.500 --> 02:46:34.521]  Look at it for yourself.
[02:46:34.601 --> 02:46:35.681]  It's hell on earth.
[02:46:36.101 --> 02:46:40.163]  And people say, well, let them come here and then that'll, you know, take the heat off the other countries.
[02:46:40.423 --> 02:46:45.725]  We could take 50 million a year and it wouldn't even touch global third world population growth.
[02:46:46.025 --> 02:46:47.126]  You know, let me tell you.
[02:46:47.626 --> 02:46:56.009]  Alex, each 18 months, the third world adds the equivalent of an entire Mexico in population.
[02:46:56.029 --> 02:47:02.212]  100 million people are added to third world populations every 18 months.
[02:47:02.592 --> 02:47:08.314]  We're going to have 3 billion more people by 2050 in this world than you have now.
[02:47:08.814 --> 02:47:09.915]  And all of them know now
[02:47:10.954 --> 02:47:13.836]  The place to go is the good old USA.
[02:47:13.876 --> 02:47:14.977]  You don't get deported.
[02:47:15.417 --> 02:47:16.638]  You don't get roughed up.
[02:47:16.718 --> 02:47:18.140]  You can have welfare.
[02:47:18.160 --> 02:47:21.322]  You might be able to get a job, which you can make ten times what you made at home.
[02:47:21.582 --> 02:47:22.623]  Pat, let me bring this up real quick.
[02:47:22.643 --> 02:47:23.423]  I want to come back in front of you.
[02:47:23.444 --> 02:47:24.284]  I have one or two calls in.
[02:47:24.344 --> 02:47:25.625]  I'm sorry we haven't gone to your calls yet.
[02:47:25.945 --> 02:47:26.606]  Loaded phones here.
[02:47:27.584 --> 02:47:30.705]  Uh, we had four cases of leprosy until 2004.
[02:47:30.805 --> 02:47:31.406]  Now we've had 7,000.
[02:47:31.786 --> 02:47:33.807]  They have a leper colony in East Texas.
[02:47:34.227 --> 02:47:35.847]  TB is exploding everywhere.
[02:47:36.208 --> 02:47:40.029]  I mean, at least they tested people, even Europeans, everybody coming in at Ellis Island.
[02:47:40.089 --> 02:47:45.851]  Now, it's just people can walk off planes with leprosy splattering all over the place, and it's just, like, wonderful.
[02:47:45.911 --> 02:47:47.692]  I mean, this is insane!
[02:47:47.992 --> 02:47:50.533]  Well, I saw over the weekend, Drudge had a report.
[02:47:50.553 --> 02:47:53.895]  12 or 13 cases of bubonic plague they found.
[02:47:54.295 --> 02:47:54.555]  TB.
[02:47:55.336 --> 02:48:02.398]  Immigrant children are a hundred times more likely to be carrying TB into the classroom than native-born American children.
[02:48:02.939 --> 02:48:09.441]  One in every seven East Asians in New York City, that's a hundred thousand people, has tuberculosis.
[02:48:09.901 --> 02:48:11.221]  You've got dengue fever.
[02:48:11.241 --> 02:48:13.202]  You've got Chagas's disease coming in.
[02:48:13.562 --> 02:48:15.103]  You've got malaria coming in.
[02:48:15.143 --> 02:48:17.583]  Things we cured and things we never had in America.
[02:48:17.803 --> 02:48:19.384]  You read reports of bed bugs.
[02:48:19.904 --> 02:48:21.105]  Found in all these states.
[02:48:21.185 --> 02:48:22.206]  Where do they think they're coming?
[02:48:22.526 --> 02:48:25.228]  The illegal aliens go through no check whatsoever.
[02:48:25.709 --> 02:48:27.290]  They come in and they bring these with them.
[02:48:27.670 --> 02:48:34.996]  Again, and the media keeps it almost completely quiet because they've got to do it to break down the republic.
[02:48:35.056 --> 02:48:36.497]  The country is under attack.
[02:48:36.537 --> 02:48:40.180]  George Bush is directing those attacks with his neocon traitors.
[02:48:40.440 --> 02:48:41.101]  We'll be right back.
[02:48:41.181 --> 02:48:43.463]  Final segment with Pat Buchanan to take a few of your calls.
[02:48:48.419 --> 02:48:51.600]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[02:48:51.960 --> 02:48:53.841]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[02:48:54.261 --> 02:49:01.924]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:49:02.584 --> 02:49:09.647]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:49:10.047 --> 02:49:16.950]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying,
[02:49:17.429 --> 02:49:21.472]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:49:21.773 --> 02:49:25.355]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:49:25.756 --> 02:49:27.657]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:49:27.998 --> 02:49:31.941]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:49:45.191 --> 02:49:47.052]  Dad, can we stop?
[02:49:47.372 --> 02:49:48.892]  We need to go to the bathroom.
[02:49:49.312 --> 02:49:49.572]  What?
[02:49:49.913 --> 02:49:50.273]  Again?
[02:49:50.693 --> 02:49:52.333]  We just stopped two hours ago.
[02:49:52.393 --> 02:49:56.815]  Honey, let's stop, because I gave the kids their Spark Berkey water bottles.
[02:49:57.055 --> 02:49:58.335]  Why did you do that?
[02:49:58.555 --> 02:50:04.357]  Because they can't drink and talk at the same time, and that way we don't have to listen to them singing, Are we there yet?
[02:50:04.637 --> 02:50:05.677]  Are we there yet?
[02:50:05.777 --> 02:50:06.838]  for the entire trip.
[02:50:07.098 --> 02:50:09.299]  Hmm, I didn't think about that.
[02:50:09.779 --> 02:50:10.799]  Great idea.
[02:50:11.079 --> 02:50:13.660]  Yeah, and it's cheap entertainment for the kids.
[02:50:14.020 --> 02:50:16.483]  Bottled water costs around 75 cents a bottle.
[02:50:16.683 --> 02:50:21.068]  And using our Bertie Sport bottles, it costs us less than two and a half cents per refill.
[02:50:21.348 --> 02:50:21.669]  Honey!
[02:50:22.492 --> 02:50:23.732]  You're terrific!
[02:50:24.133 --> 02:50:25.613]  Oh honey, so are you!
[02:50:25.733 --> 02:50:29.134]  You're the one that bought the family our Sport Berkey Water Bottles!
[02:50:29.415 --> 02:50:30.215]  Now can we stop?
[02:50:30.715 --> 02:50:31.435]  I need to go too.

[02:51:45.430 --> 02:51:51.612]  Final segment, we just got time to talk to Sean and Caleb about Buchanan and that end of broadcast.
[02:51:54.622 --> 02:51:59.804]  It's so important to understand that the New World Order has to destroy the United States to get their world government.
[02:52:00.224 --> 02:52:08.086]  Pat Buchanan, do you think the globalists are overplaying their hand and that they're not going to be able to carry out their American Union and open borders and the rest of it?
[02:52:08.486 --> 02:52:13.448]  Or will they just crack down with their police state and enforce the destruction of this country?
[02:52:14.108 --> 02:52:23.791]  I believe that the American people are so aroused here and they're so... I mean, they're so intently patriotic and against these ideas
[02:52:24.520 --> 02:52:26.400]  Of merging America with another country.
[02:52:26.540 --> 02:52:29.841]  I think we've got a fighting chance on this one.
[02:52:29.901 --> 02:52:35.102]  The President, I think if the Republicans do not secure these borders, I think they're going to be wiped out.
[02:52:35.562 --> 02:52:39.643]  Now, the Democrats aren't going to do it either, but you'll get a new kind of Republican Party coming.
[02:52:41.543 --> 02:52:44.184]  You got to get rid of all the Rockefeller New World Order Republicans?
[02:52:44.224 --> 02:52:45.764]  Oh yeah, that's the only way to do it.
[02:52:45.784 --> 02:52:50.225]  I mean, you've got the Crystals and the Weekly Standard crowd and all the rest of them.
[02:52:51.232 --> 02:52:52.713]  Lobbyists for La Raza there.
[02:52:52.773 --> 02:52:58.038]  You got Karl Rove going out speaking to La Raza, competing with Clinton.
[02:52:58.238 --> 02:52:59.038]  For heaven's sakes!
[02:52:59.719 --> 02:53:00.500]  Let's take a call.
[02:53:00.600 --> 02:53:01.721]  Sean in Arizona.
[02:53:01.741 --> 02:53:02.942]  You're on the air with Pat Buchanan.
[02:53:03.662 --> 02:53:05.103]  Hi, glad to be on the show, Pat.
[02:53:05.884 --> 02:53:18.975]  I have Mexican-American friends here in Arizona, and I was talking to one, and he is just up in arms about these La Raza people coming in, saying that this is Mexico, and in his opinion,
[02:53:19.711 --> 02:53:28.157]  If this doesn't get taken care of, the citizens of Arizona, including naturalized Mexicans, are going to start taking care of it themselves.
[02:53:28.637 --> 02:53:31.599]  Well, you know, that's an excellent point.
[02:53:31.619 --> 02:53:43.767]  47% of Mexican-Americans in Arizona voted in favor of Proposition 200, which requires folks to prove they belong here before they get social welfare benefits.
[02:53:44.068 --> 02:53:45.989]  Yet the whole Republican delegation
[02:53:46.750 --> 02:53:49.971]  Opposed it, as did the Democratic Governor and all the elites there.
[02:53:50.331 --> 02:53:58.192]  But Mexican-Americans are patriotic people, they're hard-working people, they have great values, many of them belong to the same faith as I do.
[02:53:58.333 --> 02:54:05.674]  And I've talked to them and they're upset because everybody was getting along before, now millions of people are running around saying they're going to kill whites and it's causing friction.
[02:54:05.874 --> 02:54:09.355]  Exactly, and I can't imagine people tramping around under foreign flags.
[02:54:09.715 --> 02:54:14.476]  These folks have lived under the American flag, many of them have fought under the American flag.
[02:54:15.097 --> 02:54:21.860]  And the idea that these people are coming in and representing themselves as, you know, somehow Mexican-Americans is preposterous!
[02:54:22.060 --> 02:54:24.361]  Final caller, Caleb in Texas.
[02:54:24.381 --> 02:54:26.962]  You're on the air with Pat Buchanan with the new book, State of Emergency.
[02:54:26.982 --> 02:54:27.362]  Go ahead.
[02:54:27.622 --> 02:54:28.222]  Hello, gentlemen.
[02:54:28.322 --> 02:54:29.703]  Pat Buchanan, one question.
[02:54:29.723 --> 02:54:33.144]  9-11 and George Bush's war on terror is indeed legitimate.
[02:54:33.764 --> 02:54:37.946]  Why wasn't the border totally militarily secured on September 12, 2001?
[02:54:39.667 --> 02:54:40.727]  It's because George Bush
[02:54:41.715 --> 02:54:44.035]  He doesn't want to secure that border.
[02:54:44.176 --> 02:54:47.616]  I do believe he wants an open border between the United States and Mexico.
[02:54:48.036 --> 02:54:53.998]  He does not share the concern of a lot of us that this is a national security problem.
[02:54:54.018 --> 02:54:57.078]  Pat, won't he just get more power if there's another terror attack?
[02:54:57.178 --> 02:54:58.679]  That he can take more American liberties?
[02:54:59.079 --> 02:55:05.260]  I think if the terrorists have come across that Mexican border, I think his place in history is finished.
[02:55:06.698 --> 02:55:11.342]  But my point is, if he got so much power out of 9-11 and got the grandstand... Right.
[02:55:11.382 --> 02:55:12.823]  Well, look, there's no doubt about it.
[02:55:12.883 --> 02:55:14.864]  I mean, war is the health of the state.
[02:55:14.944 --> 02:55:16.325]  You know it as well as I do, Alex.
[02:55:16.365 --> 02:55:25.693]  So do you agree with me that they could try to spin it, even though common sense, we would see if there was another attack, they could kind of spin it and ignore the border issue, and Bush could get even more power out of it?
[02:55:26.053 --> 02:55:28.014]  Well, yeah, sure, sure.
[02:55:28.455 --> 02:55:30.676]  And put in a lot more laws and things like that.
[02:55:31.037 --> 02:55:32.658]  But I do think people would say, look,
[02:55:33.487 --> 02:55:36.508]  You did not seal that border, just as the caller said.
[02:55:36.888 --> 02:55:41.149]  When you had three or four, you had four years, or five years to do it, you didn't do it.
[02:55:41.769 --> 02:55:43.029]  And now we got hit again.
[02:55:43.529 --> 02:55:45.150]  You are responsible this time.
[02:55:45.590 --> 02:55:47.890]  Eisenhower sealed it, and deported a million.
[02:55:48.350 --> 02:55:50.971]  Eisenhower sealed it, and Operation Wetback.
[02:55:51.331 --> 02:55:54.292]  Sure he did, he saw a threat to the country, he said, what's going on down there?
[02:55:54.812 --> 02:55:58.853]  And he sent another general, Joseph Mays, he said, you know, deal with this, Joe!
[02:55:59.992 --> 02:56:02.014]  And again, people try to say that term is racist.
[02:56:02.054 --> 02:56:03.675]  They turn every term into racism.
[02:56:03.715 --> 02:56:05.476]  It just means you swam over the river.
[02:56:05.617 --> 02:56:07.798]  Exactly, or you waded across, for heaven's sakes.
[02:56:08.098 --> 02:56:10.520]  Yeah, but they would call it that because they'd catch people at the border.
[02:56:10.560 --> 02:56:11.141]  They'd be wet.
[02:56:11.501 --> 02:56:12.722]  Pat Buchanan, thank you.
[02:56:12.762 --> 02:56:14.524]  Your book's number one state of emergency.
[02:56:14.564 --> 02:56:15.344]  Thank you for joining us.
[02:56:15.364 --> 02:56:16.385]  Hope to talk to you again soon.
[02:56:16.645 --> 02:56:17.126]  Thank you.
[02:56:17.566 --> 02:56:18.046]  God bless.
[02:56:18.126 --> 02:56:18.527]  All right.

[02:56:19.968 --> 02:56:21.189]  Back tomorrow, 11 to 2.
