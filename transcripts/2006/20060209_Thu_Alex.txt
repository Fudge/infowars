[00:00:05.773 --> 00:00:06.413]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.074 --> 00:00:08.155]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.855 --> 00:00:09.956]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.617 --> 00:00:11.417]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.178 --> 00:00:13.099]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.739 --> 00:00:17.442]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.923 --> 00:00:21.986]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:25.328 --> 00:00:29.429]  Well, we have several great guests lined up later into the broadcast today.
[00:00:29.469 --> 00:00:31.770]  We'll be here live for the next three hours.
[00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:33.271]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[00:00:33.951 --> 00:00:35.852]  Thank you for joining us today.
[00:00:37.714 --> 00:00:44.017]  I have quite a bit of news that fits into the absurd bend, but it's not absurd.
[00:00:44.238 --> 00:00:45.278]  It's really happening.
[00:00:45.878 --> 00:00:48.300]  Good news for rapists and criminals.
[00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:55.003]  British government bans knives is the headline, and it's up on prisonplanet.com.
[00:00:55.023 --> 00:01:01.246]  Here it is from the London Independent reporting with a straight face that turn your knives in.
[00:01:01.266 --> 00:01:06.089]  And of course, in ancient China, only select
[00:01:06.835 --> 00:01:11.159]  Chefs were allowed to have a knife over about an inch long.
[00:01:13.281 --> 00:01:20.568]  And in imperial Rome, and even in the Republic, slaves could not have a knife.
[00:01:20.768 --> 00:01:31.398]  And slaves, even if they were out, say, shepherding sheep, were not allowed to have a dog that had all of its toes, or all of its pads, all of its digits.
[00:01:31.498 --> 00:01:31.819]  They would...
[00:01:32.902 --> 00:01:58.682]  Exize out normally two of the outer paw points, whatever you want to call them, on the outer side of each front leg so the dog cannot be trained to be used as a weapon or so the dog cannot hunt the king or the local noble's deer or other animals because how dare the serfs be able to feed themselves?
[00:01:59.628 --> 00:02:01.109]  And this is how it's always worked.
[00:02:01.169 --> 00:02:06.612]  Any real criminal can fashion a knife just in a few minutes that will devastate someone.
[00:02:07.112 --> 00:02:08.412]  Anything can be used as a weapon.
[00:02:08.512 --> 00:02:12.474]  Pencils, pens, sewing needles, you name it.
[00:02:12.855 --> 00:02:17.537]  You can make a shank out of sheet metal in just a few minutes.
[00:02:17.877 --> 00:02:19.298]  And the government knows that.
[00:02:19.338 --> 00:02:23.340]  There's more knives in prisons than there are on the streets.
[00:02:24.424 --> 00:02:34.815]  And we always joke about what's next, banning knives and then Louisville sluggers, because there are more murders committed each year in the United States with knives than there are with guns.
[00:02:35.515 --> 00:02:42.743]  And of course, there are thousands of deaths each year from blunt objects, so the answer is ban fireplace pokers, baseball bats...
[00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:44.301]  Everything.
[00:02:44.381 --> 00:02:45.201]  Ban everything.
[00:02:45.261 --> 00:02:48.304]  Let's just lobotomize everyone and then all crime will end.
[00:02:48.844 --> 00:02:56.891]  No, and then notice simultaneously while they try to disarm us, the government's arming to the teeth, bristling with weaponry against us.
[00:02:56.931 --> 00:02:58.732]  So we'll get into that absurdity.
[00:02:58.772 --> 00:03:00.334]  In fact, I think I just did get into it.
[00:03:00.354 --> 00:03:01.194]  We'll get into more of it.
[00:03:01.875 --> 00:03:05.638]  And this one, first graders suspended for sexual harassment.
[00:03:06.939 --> 00:03:09.942]  And this particular case is getting a lot of attention, but this is nothing.
[00:03:11.174 --> 00:03:19.618]  Every week or so I see articles very similar to this, where you write an essay, a fiction essay, and talk about the police officer's gun.
[00:03:19.938 --> 00:03:21.479]  You're suspended or arrested.
[00:03:21.539 --> 00:03:29.823]  Even in your little story, if you say the police officer had a gun on his hip and took down the bad guys, they literally start freaking out.
[00:03:29.903 --> 00:03:32.164]  Thought crime, he wrote God!
[00:03:32.745 --> 00:03:37.707]  But it's okay to go home and play violent video games on the Xbox where you simulate tens of thousands of murders.
[00:03:40.092 --> 00:03:42.233]  So, again, that is coming up.
[00:03:42.333 --> 00:03:43.433]  We'll get into it.
[00:03:43.794 --> 00:03:46.114]  Banned drugs still being prescribed to children.
[00:03:46.234 --> 00:03:46.915]  Oh, yeah.
[00:03:48.435 --> 00:03:49.476]  That's over in England.
[00:03:49.496 --> 00:03:52.897]  They banned doing it, but the government continues, and the doctors continue.
[00:03:53.677 --> 00:03:56.739]  Since when do they follow the law if it's New World Order directed?
[00:03:56.999 --> 00:04:05.582]  And, of course, here in the U.S., you're not supposed to give them to children under the age of three, but there are tens of thousands on it who are a year and a half old, two years old.
[00:04:07.046 --> 00:04:07.967]  So it's the same here.
[00:04:08.787 --> 00:04:09.728]  You're not supposed to do it.
[00:04:09.808 --> 00:04:10.508]  It's illegal.
[00:04:10.568 --> 00:04:11.289]  It's not approved.
[00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:13.570]  But hey, just type it into Google.
[00:04:13.991 --> 00:04:23.097]  Thousands of toddlers on psychotropics or on antidepressants and you'll hear about thousands and thousands of one-year-olds on it.
[00:04:23.137 --> 00:04:31.902]  Why, the governor of Oregon a few years ago said that they need to start giving children drugs in the womb if they come from a bad socioeconomic background.
[00:04:32.823 --> 00:04:35.505]  Yes, it's a science fiction nightmare right out in the open.
[00:04:36.571 --> 00:04:38.372]  So we'll get into that.
[00:04:39.152 --> 00:04:41.693]  Israel says they may ruse Saddam's overthrow.
[00:04:41.954 --> 00:04:44.715]  That's the head of Shin Bet, their domestic intelligence agency.
[00:04:45.955 --> 00:04:48.436]  50% of Gitmo detainees not accused of hostile acts.
[00:04:48.456 --> 00:04:54.119]  They're all trying basically to commit suicide right now, being force-fed through tubes.
[00:04:55.079 --> 00:04:56.220]  We'll be right back.
[00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:57.120]  Tons of news.
[00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:00.502]  Your calls, prisonplan.tv and fullwars.net.
[00:05:01.343 --> 00:05:02.824]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:05:03.004 --> 00:05:06.107]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[00:05:06.227 --> 00:05:10.150]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:14.414]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2, The Takeover.
[00:05:14.754 --> 00:05:18.537]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[00:05:18.677 --> 00:05:20.559]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[00:05:20.659 --> 00:05:24.002]  Riot police attacked people on the streets indiscriminately.
[00:05:24.022 --> 00:05:25.103]  The medical bills.
[00:05:26.703 --> 00:05:28.744]  Are going to be enormous for me.
[00:05:28.884 --> 00:05:31.925]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[00:05:32.105 --> 00:05:35.006]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[00:05:35.447 --> 00:05:41.569]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[00:05:42.109 --> 00:05:42.830]  We're good to go.
[00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:43.330]  We're good to go.
[00:06:02.344 --> 00:06:03.364]  The war on terrorism.
[00:06:03.704 --> 00:06:06.485]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[00:06:06.745 --> 00:06:10.906]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[00:06:11.326 --> 00:06:12.167]  So what do you do?
[00:06:12.467 --> 00:06:17.068]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[00:06:17.548 --> 00:06:19.669]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[00:06:20.149 --> 00:06:21.009]  Sheltering in place.
[00:06:21.454 --> 00:06:22.195]  We're good to go.
[00:06:47.014 --> 00:06:48.417]  Or order on the web at BerkeyWater.com.
[00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:07.392]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[00:07:07.612 --> 00:07:12.613]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using the Rife frequency technology.
[00:07:12.953 --> 00:07:20.855]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:07:21.015 --> 00:07:28.037]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:07:28.277 --> 00:07:29.478]  There are no side effects.
[00:07:29.638 --> 00:07:33.021]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[00:07:33.081 --> 00:07:35.764]  Don't just treat symptoms, eliminate the cause.
[00:07:35.964 --> 00:07:42.810]  BioSolutions has over 550 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:45.372]  Customer satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.
[00:07:45.552 --> 00:07:48.476]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll-free 866-885-6625.
[00:07:48.496 --> 00:07:48.536]  866-885-6625.
[00:07:48.556 --> 00:07:49.517]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[00:08:05.988 --> 00:08:06.628]  Big Brother.
[00:08:07.289 --> 00:08:08.349]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:10.150]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:10.811 --> 00:08:11.631]  You want answers?
[00:08:12.392 --> 00:08:13.292]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:13.312 --> 00:08:17.895]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:18.135 --> 00:08:22.257]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:22.998 --> 00:08:30.282]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to this live Thursday edition.
[00:08:31.403 --> 00:08:33.264]  The ninth day of February.
[00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:39.282]  2006, and we're going to be here for the next two hours and 51 minutes.
[00:08:39.302 --> 00:08:41.484]  We're now already into the second segment.
[00:08:41.544 --> 00:08:44.866]  A lot of stations don't carry the first segment, so for many, this is the first.
[00:08:45.206 --> 00:08:45.647]  Welcome.
[00:08:45.747 --> 00:08:52.071]  Thank you again so much for joining us as we defend liberty and resist and fight against tyranny.
[00:08:52.311 --> 00:08:54.032]  That has always been the human struggle.
[00:08:55.746 --> 00:09:03.533]  Since the agrarian age 6,000 years ago, since we began to congregate in larger and larger groups.
[00:09:03.573 --> 00:09:13.803]  Before that, it was a struggle against the elements and a struggle against the beast of the field, the grizzly bears, the lions, the leopards, the cobras.
[00:09:17.017 --> 00:09:21.721]  But for the last 6,000 years, man has been struggling against man.
[00:09:21.761 --> 00:09:27.365]  We are the super predator, the dominant force on the planet today.
[00:09:30.268 --> 00:09:32.709]  Good news for rapists and criminals.
[00:09:32.769 --> 00:09:34.931]  British government bans knives.
[00:09:34.971 --> 00:09:36.412]  And it's right here in the London Independent.
[00:09:37.153 --> 00:09:39.635]  Paul Watson wrote this little comment on it.
[00:09:40.254 --> 00:09:41.815]  Launches PR amnesty.
[00:09:41.855 --> 00:09:45.177]  Encourage your citizens to turn in all your knives.
[00:09:45.217 --> 00:09:47.578]  And we'll talk about the psychology behind this.
[00:09:48.278 --> 00:09:49.319]  Now content.
[00:09:50.163 --> 00:10:00.749]  ...are not content with eliminating the last vestiges of private gun ownership, a policy which saw gun crime figures balloon after they banned guns ten years ago.
[00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:04.592]  The British government has now declared war on knives.
[00:10:05.112 --> 00:10:12.456]  Criminals can now rape women, safe in the knowledge that they now have absolutely no means which to fight back.
[00:10:12.576 --> 00:10:18.520]  And I have seen countless articles out of England until I become desensitized and don't even cover them anymore.
[00:10:19.082 --> 00:10:20.203]  We all get conditioned to it.
[00:10:21.444 --> 00:10:41.578]  Where a man will be beating and raping another man's wife in their house and the man will stab the guy five times and the police come and they find the attacker dead down the street and they actually charge the man who stabbed the intruder to death saying, well, you should have only stabbed him once.
[00:10:42.298 --> 00:10:44.220]  You plunged the knife into him.
[00:10:44.895 --> 00:10:50.237]  Now, obviously, if you're going to get fired up enough to stab somebody, you're going to stab them until they're dead.
[00:10:50.277 --> 00:10:51.298]  That's the normal instinct.
[00:10:51.378 --> 00:10:52.298]  It's natural and good.
[00:10:52.599 --> 00:10:54.339]  And that's what the cops would do.
[00:10:54.359 --> 00:11:02.863]  But this is the mass insanity that is being programmed scientifically into the population.
[00:11:03.163 --> 00:11:13.628]  The London Independent reports today, a five-week national knives amnesty is being launched in the summer in an attempt to drive down numbers of stabbings.
[00:11:14.525 --> 00:11:19.229]  With the wonderful giant third world population you brought in that likes to stab people, and that's their own statistics.
[00:11:19.929 --> 00:11:37.283]  Under the amnesty, which will run between the 24th of May and the 30th of June in England, Wales and Scotland, members of the public, can leave bladed weapons, drop it in a bin, which will be provided at police stations throughout the country without fear of prosecution.
[00:11:39.150 --> 00:11:39.470]  I think.
[00:11:39.490 --> 00:11:39.650]  I think.
[00:11:55.623 --> 00:11:57.764]  We know that that's not how it works.
[00:11:57.864 --> 00:12:13.528]  Self-indulgent do-gooders who think they're misbehaving by as much as crossing a road or a red light will pave the way for law-abiding citizens to be disarmed of even their trusty kitchen knife.
[00:12:13.888 --> 00:12:14.508]  What's next?
[00:12:14.588 --> 00:12:16.529]  Will we be allowed to own baseball bats?
[00:12:17.109 --> 00:12:17.649]  We're good to go.
[00:12:17.669 --> 00:12:18.310]  We're good to go.
[00:12:45.678 --> 00:12:46.639]  We're good to go.
[00:12:46.659 --> 00:12:47.700]  We're good to go.
[00:13:13.211 --> 00:13:20.819]  They arrest them because children want to play tag and dodgeball, which have both been banned across the nation in almost every school district.
[00:13:20.879 --> 00:13:26.005]  And so they go sneak off like we used to sneak off and smoke cigarettes or chew tobacco.
[00:13:27.476 --> 00:13:28.757]  No, no, not anymore.
[00:13:29.557 --> 00:13:43.781]  Now you sneak behind the ag building or you sneak behind the shop building or you sneak off in the woods by the school behind the baseball fields to play dodgeball or to play tag.
[00:13:44.322 --> 00:13:54.025]  And then the school police come because it's considered violent and they arrest you and you get to go and get into the system and you usually get released in a day or so.
[00:13:54.705 --> 00:14:08.629]  And then, though now you have a probation officer, then you don't do something right, and then you end up with AIDS, being raped by Bubba five years later when you're 17 years old, and then you have tattoos all over your body, and you're dealing methamphetamine, and your life's over.
[00:14:08.809 --> 00:14:11.490]  And that's really how it works for most people who go to prison.
[00:14:11.510 --> 00:14:13.231]  They end up getting into a bad situation.
[00:14:13.431 --> 00:14:15.191]  That's the lovingness of the government.
[00:14:15.211 --> 00:14:16.832]  That's the good thing they do.
[00:14:16.872 --> 00:14:20.013]  And it's all part and parcel of banning knives.
[00:14:21.741 --> 00:14:25.583]  And all throughout history in ancient Rome, the slaves couldn't have knives.
[00:14:25.623 --> 00:14:26.664]  Same thing in China.
[00:14:26.804 --> 00:14:30.746]  Special chefs who were allowed to have a knife, as I said earlier, over an inch long.
[00:14:30.786 --> 00:14:32.427]  It's in the official Chinese history books.
[00:14:33.028 --> 00:14:36.470]  You would have to pay a special license to have a knife to be able to cut meat.
[00:14:37.490 --> 00:14:38.191]  You're good to go.
[00:15:03.034 --> 00:15:05.297]  So, side issue, I'm digressing.
[00:15:06.118 --> 00:15:13.648]  But imagine, I mean, I've been in London last year, and there's just troops with machine guns everywhere, militarized police, cameras everywhere.
[00:15:14.108 --> 00:15:19.094]  We just go up and interview an old lady, and cops run over and say, turn your camera off, give me your name, where do you stay?
[00:15:19.355 --> 00:15:21.017]  I'm putting you in the terrorism database.
[00:15:21.633 --> 00:15:24.195]  And I told you about that and put the video on the website.
[00:15:24.235 --> 00:15:27.157]  Now it's BBC reporting it like it's good.
[00:15:27.597 --> 00:15:32.721]  Oh yes, anyone out doing anything, protesting anything, doing anything, will be put in the terrorist database.
[00:15:33.281 --> 00:15:34.342]  But go ahead and protest.
[00:15:34.362 --> 00:15:36.804]  You've still got that right in selected areas.
[00:15:39.506 --> 00:15:41.647]  So, I'm not trying to scare people, folks.
[00:15:41.667 --> 00:15:42.568]  This is what's happening.
[00:15:43.453 --> 00:15:46.175]  Here with the new Patriot Act, they're trying to reauthorize and expand.
[00:15:46.656 --> 00:15:52.180]  Any, quote, disturbance is a felony, and there's going to be a new national police force where you just disappear.
[00:15:52.861 --> 00:16:00.548]  You just disappear for years, starting at a year, up to ten years, tens of thousands of dollars in fines, if they don't like the shirt you're wearing.
[00:16:03.430 --> 00:16:07.293]  And I guess we can all just be afraid and cower and go, well, that's what America's about.
[00:16:07.353 --> 00:16:09.155]  Terrorists, terrorists can't protest.
[00:16:10.458 --> 00:16:11.519]  A lot of people are going to do that.
[00:16:11.559 --> 00:16:13.319]  They're going to say, I ain't going to protest.
[00:16:13.459 --> 00:16:14.159]  That's bad.
[00:16:14.660 --> 00:16:16.200]  Hello, Mr. Ski Mask.
[00:16:17.420 --> 00:16:20.321]  I give donations to the Fraternal Order of Stormtroopers.
[00:16:20.641 --> 00:16:21.982]  Will you be nice to me?
[00:16:22.042 --> 00:16:23.702]  My son's going to be one of you.
[00:16:24.142 --> 00:16:24.643]  That's right.
[00:16:24.683 --> 00:16:26.063]  Let me pat you on the head, citizen.
[00:16:26.323 --> 00:16:26.623]  Good.
[00:16:26.683 --> 00:16:27.403]  Grovel to me.
[00:16:27.443 --> 00:16:28.524]  That's good.
[00:16:28.584 --> 00:16:32.305]  That's your land of the slave and home of the peons.
[00:16:37.051 --> 00:16:37.933]  That's what they're doing.
[00:16:37.973 --> 00:16:39.175]  That's what's happened to this country.
[00:16:39.215 --> 00:16:40.577]  I'm not trying to be negative here.
[00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:43.542]  They know what they're doing.
[00:16:43.743 --> 00:16:44.985]  Everything is a crime.
[00:16:46.161 --> 00:16:47.261]  Everything is a crime.
[00:16:47.762 --> 00:16:52.083]  Oh, the chip in your inspection sticker that we tax you with and track you with, it's damaged.
[00:16:52.763 --> 00:16:55.244]  And, oh, we can prove that you disabled it.
[00:16:56.204 --> 00:17:00.666]  How about one to five years in prison with a felony for that?
[00:17:00.746 --> 00:17:05.327]  You see, that's the type of bills they're trying to pass and are passing in some states.
[00:17:05.827 --> 00:17:06.928]  Oh, it's Ohio.
[00:17:07.388 --> 00:17:13.009]  You didn't answer the questions the police had for you on the side of the road or in a shopping mall, anywhere.
[00:17:13.330 --> 00:17:14.430]  Oh, that's a felony.
[00:17:14.890 --> 00:17:16.511]  We're taking you to jail now.
[00:17:16.791 --> 00:17:18.012]  You don't have a Fifth Amendment.
[00:17:18.232 --> 00:17:19.913]  You've got to answer all our questions.
[00:17:22.494 --> 00:17:23.975]  He signed the bill a few weeks ago.
[00:17:24.015 --> 00:17:25.896]  See, this is what's happening.
[00:17:26.756 --> 00:17:32.219]  They put the police state mechanisms in place and they start slowly closing the net around your throats.
[00:17:32.419 --> 00:17:33.359]  Around all our throats.
[00:17:35.140 --> 00:17:35.981]  But we have the power.
[00:17:36.021 --> 00:17:41.183]  We can scream bloody murder and say no to this and have the police stand up and say no to this, which they are in many cases.
[00:17:41.804 --> 00:17:44.345]  And we can stand up and defend the republic against these enemies.
[00:17:45.177 --> 00:17:46.158]  Here's USA Today.
[00:17:46.238 --> 00:17:49.400]  First graders suspended for a month for sexual harassment.
[00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:54.203]  And of course, they don't even let these kids have a desk.
[00:17:54.743 --> 00:18:00.147]  They have to sit around their little communal on the carpet, learning how to meditate, basically.
[00:18:00.827 --> 00:18:06.191]  And this six-year-old supposedly was patting a girl on the back.
[00:18:07.658 --> 00:18:10.719]  And so they called the district attorney for criminal charges.
[00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:15.141]  The police came, but it was deferred from criminal charges.
[00:18:15.161 --> 00:18:17.222]  He was just suspended for a month.
[00:18:19.563 --> 00:18:31.889]  Now, I came to the office this morning and I said, how many of you, when you were six years old, would kiss in first or second grade?
[00:18:32.349 --> 00:18:33.730]  And everybody said, oh yeah, of course.
[00:18:34.434 --> 00:18:39.217]  I mean, I remember a girl named Sarah something when I was in first grade.
[00:18:39.537 --> 00:18:40.217]  She ran back.
[00:18:40.257 --> 00:18:41.218]  She kissed me on the cheek.
[00:18:41.338 --> 00:18:42.138]  I had a crush on her.
[00:18:42.178 --> 00:18:43.139]  I didn't know she liked me.
[00:18:43.519 --> 00:18:44.339]  And I turned red.
[00:18:44.359 --> 00:18:45.120]  The teacher laughed.
[00:18:45.140 --> 00:18:46.080]  I knew it was so cute.
[00:18:46.620 --> 00:18:47.641]  Not anymore, man.
[00:18:47.661 --> 00:18:48.802]  She's going to jail.
[00:18:49.602 --> 00:18:53.264]  And we're going to cram some Ritalin and Prozac down your throat by the time we're done with you.
[00:18:54.039 --> 00:19:00.842]  Meanwhile, the border's wide open and truck bombs are going off in Dallas and there's 800 dead and no one even knows about it.
[00:19:00.862 --> 00:19:03.883]  It's just foreign troops running around killing everybody.
[00:19:04.323 --> 00:19:11.346]  But that's okay because if you go out in the playground and you play tag or you play dodgeball and you get caught, you're going to jail.
[00:19:12.006 --> 00:19:18.292]  If your dad's a Marine Corps captain and you draw a picture of him with his gun for your art class, you're going to be arrested and suspended.
[00:19:18.512 --> 00:19:36.768]  If you're a valedictorian last day of school bringing in plastic knives in a Dixie package, a Dixie spoon and knives package, and you're going in to have a party for your local school club because you're also school president, the security guard's going to see the plastic knives in the container and you're going to lose...
[00:19:37.805 --> 00:19:45.908]  And they ended up suspending her, taking her degree away from her, taking her high school degree, and she had to go to summer school.
[00:19:45.928 --> 00:19:46.928]  We interviewed her a few years ago.
[00:19:46.948 --> 00:19:48.289]  There was a bunch of other cases like that.
[00:19:48.529 --> 00:19:57.032]  You see, that's what zero tolerance is about, is they pass stuff that isn't even a law and then, quote, have zero tolerance and ruin people's lives.
[00:19:57.212 --> 00:19:58.432]  We are prisoners, folks.
[00:19:58.612 --> 00:19:59.953]  This is how prisoners are treated.
[00:20:02.856 --> 00:20:05.077]  Hello, Ted Anderson here with Midas Resources.
[00:20:05.498 --> 00:20:09.861]  Lately I've been hearing people tell me that gold is so low now that it would be a perfect time to buy.
[00:20:10.141 --> 00:20:15.944]  With over 20 years of personal experience in the gold business, I can tell you that opportunities like this can be counted on one hand.
[00:20:16.165 --> 00:20:20.227]  The truth is very few people have the fortitude to actually act on a market like this.
[00:20:20.507 --> 00:20:26.151]  However, they have become the elite group more than doubling their investment over moderate time span.
[00:20:26.271 --> 00:20:28.893]  In 1982, gold was trading in a range of $275 per ounce.
[00:20:30.974 --> 00:20:31.494]  You'll be glad you did.
[00:20:31.514 --> 00:20:31.715]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:20:31.735 --> 00:20:31.975]  Again, 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:01.457 --> 00:21:08.539]  Is black magic performed daily right in plain view on television, in movies, and in America's leading newspapers and magazines?
[00:21:09.179 --> 00:21:09.959]  I'm Tex Mars.
[00:21:10.379 --> 00:21:14.600]  My newest book, Codex Magica, is a real eye-opener.
[00:21:14.620 --> 00:21:18.141]  624 pages, over 1,000 photographs.
[00:21:18.702 --> 00:21:27.544]  Codex Magica shows the world's leading celebrities, from movie stars and presidents to bankers and senators, caught in the act.
[00:21:28.144 --> 00:21:28.805]  We're good to go.
[00:21:46.656 --> 00:21:47.076]  That's 1-800-234-9673.
[00:22:02.751 --> 00:22:07.254]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[00:22:07.594 --> 00:22:11.696]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[00:22:11.976 --> 00:22:12.537]  We listened.
[00:22:12.837 --> 00:22:17.820]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[00:22:18.100 --> 00:22:18.580]  We listened.
[00:22:18.961 --> 00:22:22.022]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[00:22:22.423 --> 00:22:22.963]  We listened.
[00:22:23.423 --> 00:22:27.487]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[00:22:27.867 --> 00:22:28.367]  We listened.
[00:22:28.708 --> 00:22:33.932]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[00:22:34.353 --> 00:22:35.714]  Again, we listened.
[00:22:36.074 --> 00:22:43.460]  Introducing the Berkey Light, the gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.
[00:22:43.841 --> 00:22:47.304]  Get the Berkey Light, the American water filter, for only $259 by calling
[00:22:52.793 --> 00:22:53.876]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:23:02.353 --> 00:23:03.073]  Listen up, folks.
[00:23:03.133 --> 00:23:04.354]  Did you know you've been cheated?
[00:23:04.534 --> 00:23:06.935]  You owe no debt on your bank-issued credit cards.
[00:23:07.035 --> 00:23:07.796]  You heard that right.
[00:23:07.856 --> 00:23:10.337]  You owe no debt on your bank-issued credit cards.
[00:23:10.597 --> 00:23:11.658]  You don't have to pay them off.
[00:23:11.798 --> 00:23:13.018]  The banks are defrauding you.
[00:23:13.359 --> 00:23:14.759]  Now's the time to fight back.
[00:23:14.939 --> 00:23:17.361]  You can completely wipe out your credit card debt fast.
[00:23:17.641 --> 00:23:20.602]  The procedure is easy and everything is done legally and within the law.

[00:23:26.505 --> 00:23:28.546]  The process is simple and is non-judicial.

[00:23:41.634 --> 00:23:42.674]  Fight back, America.
[00:23:42.814 --> 00:23:43.635]  Stop the fraud.
[00:23:43.795 --> 00:23:44.695]  Stop the rip-off.
[00:23:44.975 --> 00:23:47.517]  Learn the truth.
[00:23:47.537 --> 00:23:53.060]  1-2-3-NoDebt.com Come over and get our rock-solid technology that wipes out debt without bankruptcy.
[00:23:53.420 --> 00:23:56.601]  Let's say I was Kurt Vonnegut 30 years ago writing satirical, dystopic, futuristic novels.
[00:23:56.701 --> 00:23:57.041]  And I wrote...
[00:24:23.229 --> 00:24:42.837]  A book where you get arrested or suspended or go to the principal's office, bare minimum, for playing dodgeball or tag, where knives are being banned, but meanwhile the government's totally militarized, stomping around in stormtrooper outfits, you know, the classical, futuristic Darth Vader outfits, purely for intimidation.
[00:24:43.917 --> 00:24:50.980]  There are blimps flying around, spying, surveillance drones, microwave guns, huge FEMA camps.
[00:24:51.892 --> 00:24:55.914]  Millions and millions of Americans are in prison competing against the general population.
[00:24:56.654 --> 00:24:57.134]  Remember that.
[00:24:57.174 --> 00:24:59.275]  They're getting 20 cents an hour taking your job, folks.
[00:24:59.675 --> 00:25:02.276]  For all the good old boys that say make them criminals work.
[00:25:03.076 --> 00:25:12.900]  Imagine having preemptive war, invading all these countries, lying, having all of the corruption that's going on and no one getting in trouble.
[00:25:13.857 --> 00:25:14.777]  Well, I guess that's not true.
[00:25:14.837 --> 00:25:28.322]  Abramoff and others get in trouble for stuff that's nothing compared to what Cheney openly does, openly giving his wife billion-dollar-plus contracts right out of the Oval Office to Lockheed Martin.
[00:25:29.122 --> 00:25:31.383]  It's just mind-blowing.
[00:25:31.443 --> 00:25:33.404]  It's mind-boggling.
[00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:50.702]  Imagine a future world where the valedictorian, never been in trouble, pulls up and is walking into the school with a bag of plastic spoons, knives and forks and glasses and paper plates with a cake.
[00:25:51.303 --> 00:26:01.326]  For her local student group, and the goon, pot-bellied security guard comes over to her and says, what's in the bag?
[00:26:01.386 --> 00:26:03.067]  Because, you know, this is what it is to be a prisoner.
[00:26:03.367 --> 00:26:04.567]  You're always being shook down.
[00:26:04.607 --> 00:26:06.768]  You're being told, don't run, walk.
[00:26:07.028 --> 00:26:12.669]  When you're out in the yard, allowed to have a little exercise, see, with the dodgeball and the tag and the rest of it.
[00:26:13.670 --> 00:26:15.050]  You know, don't touch each other.
[00:26:15.130 --> 00:26:16.150]  Don't hug each other.
[00:26:16.510 --> 00:26:18.111]  That's sexual harassment.
[00:26:18.963 --> 00:26:20.104]  Everything's evil.
[00:26:20.164 --> 00:26:21.144]  See, everything's bad.
[00:26:21.204 --> 00:26:22.425]  Everything we do is bad.
[00:26:22.705 --> 00:26:25.426]  And why the warden's got zero tolerance.
[00:26:25.766 --> 00:26:28.107]  You do anything wrong, you're going to the hole.
[00:26:28.127 --> 00:26:30.848]  And there was national outrage.
[00:26:30.888 --> 00:26:32.329]  It happened to her and a bunch of other people.
[00:26:32.369 --> 00:26:33.149]  It's always happening.
[00:26:34.190 --> 00:26:37.231]  You always hear about it with more outrage when it's the goody-two-shoes student.
[00:26:38.052 --> 00:26:40.473]  In another case, she was on the honor roll.
[00:26:41.358 --> 00:26:41.679]  What is it?
[00:26:41.759 --> 00:26:44.621]  Salutatorian number two in the school, big school.
[00:26:45.422 --> 00:26:47.624]  She'd been on the champion basketball team.
[00:26:48.405 --> 00:26:51.448]  She was graduating a year early, about to go to college.
[00:26:51.848 --> 00:26:55.752]  Again, moving out, her pickup truck full of stuff.
[00:26:55.792 --> 00:26:57.974]  The security guard decides to inspect it.
[00:26:58.534 --> 00:26:59.555]  And there it was.
[00:26:59.876 --> 00:27:01.777]  The same thing you can go to Target and buy.
[00:27:01.817 --> 00:27:10.466]  The big paper box with the plastic window in the front with the knives and the forks and why there were some knives that doubled as steak knives.
[00:27:10.866 --> 00:27:13.328]  You know, those type that double as butter knife and steak knife.
[00:27:13.408 --> 00:27:15.110]  And she got arrested.
[00:27:15.190 --> 00:27:16.031]  Remember that?
[00:27:16.841 --> 00:27:20.642]  Or remember what was all over the New York papers two years ago when we had the father and daughter on?
[00:27:21.062 --> 00:27:23.822]  She was 14 years old and graduated from high school.
[00:27:23.862 --> 00:27:28.223]  She passed the test and had a full scholarship to one of the local universities.
[00:27:28.683 --> 00:27:34.144]  And she was in the newspaper as this incredibly intelligent young lady who got top scores.
[00:27:34.164 --> 00:27:35.765]  I think it was a 4.0.
[00:27:36.425 --> 00:27:39.485]  And she was going, and it was just so great.
[00:27:39.565 --> 00:27:43.386]  She'd been homeschooled by her father, the single father, because her mother died.
[00:27:44.444 --> 00:27:47.527]  And, oh, the police came and arrested her.
[00:27:48.448 --> 00:27:54.333]  First they tried to come arrest her, and then we had a mom, and they were absconding, I guess, and later she did get picked up.
[00:27:54.473 --> 00:27:59.998]  The father got picked up, but just for a few hours, just a preliminary thing, because the CPS said...
[00:28:01.264 --> 00:28:17.468]  It was abusive that he had homeschooled her and not let her have contact with other children and that he hadn't filled out the proper forms years before when she was in elementary school when he pulled her out of school.
[00:28:19.418 --> 00:28:24.579]  And so last time I heard, they were in the criminal justice system.
[00:28:24.820 --> 00:28:26.220]  Oh, listen, I can go on for hours.
[00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:27.020]  Would you like me to?
[00:28:27.500 --> 00:28:31.581]  Because this stuff happens every day in the town I live in, Austin, Texas.
[00:28:31.701 --> 00:28:33.042]  It's insane.
[00:28:33.382 --> 00:28:39.184]  And they train the police and the government and the district attorneys to all follow these insane orders.
[00:28:39.584 --> 00:28:41.864]  Well, it is crazy, but I'm in order to do it.
[00:28:44.345 --> 00:28:46.526]  And so this is the type of thing we're talking about.
[00:28:46.586 --> 00:28:47.666]  But how many of you...
[00:28:49.719 --> 00:29:08.912]  When you were on a field trip at the zoo and there was that girl you had a crush on and you went over and touched on her pigtails or maybe gave her a hug and maybe she liked it too and she'd give her puppy dog a hug and she gives you a hug back, well, you're going to face jail time or suspension for that.
[00:29:08.932 --> 00:29:10.113]  They arrest them all the time.
[00:29:11.221 --> 00:29:21.784]  And how many of you, when you were out by the jungle gym, how many of you, when you were in the third grade, snuck a little kiss from your sweetheart?
[00:29:22.544 --> 00:29:23.084]  Not anymore.
[00:29:23.164 --> 00:29:23.745]  Jail time.
[00:29:24.505 --> 00:29:25.125]  Jail time.
[00:29:26.185 --> 00:29:27.886]  Got to call the district attorney on this one.
[00:29:28.946 --> 00:29:29.806]  Jail time, baby.
[00:29:30.706 --> 00:29:34.728]  See, normal behavior now being criminalized.
[00:29:35.508 --> 00:29:36.048]  Meanwhile...
[00:29:37.103 --> 00:29:41.828]  Meanwhile, massive crimes are being committed right in front of everyone.
[00:29:42.768 --> 00:29:45.131]  Dying Corps openly runs giant slave camps.
[00:29:46.812 --> 00:29:48.233]  Nobody cares about those slaves.
[00:29:49.014 --> 00:29:49.495]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:51.837 --> 00:29:52.737]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.238 --> 00:29:54.839]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.760 --> 00:29:58.443]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.505 --> 00:30:07.270]  Discover a natural way to experience healthier, cleaner indoor air without expensive filters and high-maintenance machines.
[00:30:07.510 --> 00:30:09.993]  Discover what natural health professionals have known for decades.
[00:30:10.153 --> 00:30:12.775]  Natural salt lamps ionize and purify indoor air.
[00:30:12.935 --> 00:30:16.638]  Natural salt lamps come handcrafted from salt crystals that are millions of years old.
[00:30:16.758 --> 00:30:21.863]  These lamps create healthy ions that eliminate odor, reduce bacteria, and can help allergy and asthma sufferers.
[00:30:22.043 --> 00:30:22.463]  We're good to go.
[00:30:48.570 --> 00:30:48.911]  Or call 312-224-2710.
[00:30:48.951 --> 00:30:49.151]  That's 312-224-2710.
[00:31:01.972 --> 00:31:04.956]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[00:31:05.336 --> 00:31:14.146]  It's portable and requires no water pressure so you can enjoy healthy drinking water whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[00:31:14.486 --> 00:31:19.152]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[00:31:19.612 --> 00:31:26.334]  The Berkey Lot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[00:31:26.734 --> 00:31:38.517]  It also removes foul taste and odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:31:38.997 --> 00:31:43.442]  The Berkey Light's rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.
[00:31:43.622 --> 00:31:46.084]  Get the Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:31:46.104 --> 00:31:47.926]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:31:47.946 --> 00:31:49.147]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[00:31:49.227 --> 00:31:50.689]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[00:31:50.709 --> 00:31:51.750]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:32:02.566 --> 00:32:02.987]  We're good to go.
[00:32:18.266 --> 00:32:24.070]  Stem Enhance's natural ingredients help to support the release of stem cells from your bone marrow into your bloodstream.
[00:32:24.290 --> 00:32:35.739]  Through a natural process, those stem cells have the amazing ability to transform into any type of cell in the body, like heart cells, brain cells, liver cells, can all be generated from this powerful building block.
[00:32:35.999 --> 00:32:45.486]  Thousands of people who use Stem Enhance have reported spectacular results, experiencing everything from an increase in energy in just a few days to an improvement in overall health.
[00:32:45.806 --> 00:32:51.192]  Not available in stores, Stem Enhance is available by contacting Dr. Patricia Margitis at 860-567-7744.
[00:32:51.252 --> 00:32:51.753]  That's 860-567-7744.
[00:33:07.996 --> 00:33:23.384]  I got a star on my car and one on my chest A gun on my hip and the right to arrest I'm the guy who's a boss on this highway So watch out what you're doing when you're driving my way If you break the law, you'll hear from me, I know
[00:33:23.544 --> 00:33:24.964]  If you break the law, you'll hear from me, I know.
[00:33:24.984 --> 00:33:25.485]  What is tyranny?
[00:33:25.505 --> 00:33:27.685]  When the criminals get control of government, you have tyranny.
[00:33:27.765 --> 00:33:30.246]  And it is the norm in the world 98% of the time, plus historically.
[00:33:30.266 --> 00:33:32.186]  Freedom is so rare, so precious, so unknown historically.
[00:33:50.371 --> 00:33:52.872]  Normally, it's men in black uniforms or dark blue.
[00:33:53.292 --> 00:33:54.872]  That's why cops wear blue, folks.
[00:33:54.912 --> 00:33:57.153]  It's the Praetorian Guard, and that's in the history books.
[00:33:57.193 --> 00:33:57.593]  Go read it.
[00:33:58.173 --> 00:34:05.536]  Stomping around, beating everyone on the head with people up on pedestals wearing gold crowns going, Crash them!
[00:34:05.896 --> 00:34:07.016]  I mean, that's the norm.
[00:34:07.745 --> 00:34:08.746]  That's the norm.
[00:34:08.786 --> 00:34:13.550]  And having big busts of themselves carved out of marble so they can be worshipped.
[00:34:14.090 --> 00:34:15.311]  That's the norm.
[00:34:15.952 --> 00:34:16.372]  Okay?
[00:34:16.652 --> 00:34:18.113]  Freedom is rare.
[00:34:18.433 --> 00:34:20.135]  Having a middle class is rare.
[00:34:20.195 --> 00:34:22.737]  Being able to travel and do what you want is rare.
[00:34:23.077 --> 00:34:30.403]  Being able to have one person work in the family and be well off and comfortable is unknown until America...
[00:34:31.633 --> 00:34:33.115]  And we're going to lose all of that.
[00:34:33.175 --> 00:34:37.539]  They openly say they're going to take our standard of living by design for the global government.
[00:34:37.740 --> 00:34:38.521]  They brag about it.
[00:34:38.561 --> 00:34:41.284]  I've even heard them on NPR, how we deserve this.
[00:34:42.124 --> 00:34:49.052]  And there's all these people, all these soldiers, all these cops, all these well-meaning people that are working for the elite that's destroying this country.
[00:34:50.578 --> 00:34:57.701]  You being middle class and independent and intelligent is a threat to the elite throughout history.
[00:34:58.061 --> 00:34:58.901]  Figure it out.
[00:34:58.961 --> 00:35:00.682]  I'm not trying to preach here.
[00:35:00.742 --> 00:35:01.582]  I'm upset.
[00:35:03.483 --> 00:35:06.384]  It'd be like if I knew somebody was, say, a serial killer.
[00:35:08.005 --> 00:35:10.005]  I knew they were Ted Bundy and you were a woman.
[00:35:10.025 --> 00:35:12.727]  And I'm saying, listen, honey, he's a serial killer.
[00:35:12.807 --> 00:35:14.207]  Don't get in the car with him.
[00:35:14.467 --> 00:35:18.969]  He may be wearing a suit and a tie and be somewhat handsome and well-spoken.
[00:35:19.631 --> 00:35:20.432]  But listen to me.
[00:35:20.512 --> 00:35:21.372]  He's bad.
[00:35:21.492 --> 00:35:22.253]  Believe me.
[00:35:22.333 --> 00:35:23.273]  I've got evidence.
[00:35:23.734 --> 00:35:25.255]  Listen, I'm going to go call the police.
[00:35:26.135 --> 00:35:27.837]  Just please don't get in the car with him.
[00:35:28.417 --> 00:35:33.400]  Now, of course, in the real world, if I knew that was happening, I'd physically stop a woman from getting in the car with a Ted Bundy.
[00:35:33.740 --> 00:35:36.883]  But hypothetically, please don't get in the car.
[00:35:37.283 --> 00:35:38.524]  Please don't get in the car.
[00:35:38.864 --> 00:35:41.386]  And then she gets in the car, and she laughs at you.
[00:35:41.946 --> 00:35:43.447]  Oh, yes, sir.
[00:35:43.747 --> 00:35:45.548]  He tells me you're bad.
[00:35:45.909 --> 00:35:49.331]  But later, when she's hog-tied with him biting big chunks out of her,
[00:35:50.456 --> 00:35:54.517]  Later, she's going to be screaming bloody murder, wishing she would have listened.
[00:35:56.137 --> 00:36:02.039]  But that's why people get in cars with serial killers, is because they can't believe it's going to happen to them.
[00:36:02.299 --> 00:36:03.659]  It can't happen here.
[00:36:03.979 --> 00:36:05.420]  It isn't going to happen to me.
[00:36:05.660 --> 00:36:07.320]  They don't listen to their instincts.
[00:36:10.521 --> 00:36:14.922]  Why is it 30, 40, 50 years ago, your children could play in the front yard with no danger?
[00:36:16.056 --> 00:36:22.202]  Why was it that one grisly murder 50 years ago was national news and now it's nothing?
[00:36:23.423 --> 00:36:27.486]  Why is it that our crime statistics have gone up over 1,000% since the 1950s?
[00:36:29.828 --> 00:36:30.909]  Why is that?
[00:36:32.231 --> 00:36:33.832]  Because we've become evil.
[00:36:33.952 --> 00:36:37.095]  That's why, folks, we didn't abort babies 50 years ago.
[00:36:38.050 --> 00:36:42.273]  We didn't preemptively attack innocent countries 50 years ago.
[00:36:42.553 --> 00:36:45.255]  We had a Fourth Amendment 50 years ago.
[00:36:45.476 --> 00:36:51.000]  We were clean cut, and our heroes weren't sports icons like they are to the extent today.
[00:36:51.320 --> 00:36:57.604]  Our heroes were inventors and explorers and Davy Crockett and Andrew Jackson.
[00:36:57.765 --> 00:37:04.890]  But they took our heroes away, and they made our heroes a bunch of scum on television, and we're a social creature, a social animal.
[00:37:05.530 --> 00:37:08.732]  And we learn just like a dog does of imitating the alphas.
[00:37:09.212 --> 00:37:11.253]  And we've imitated false alphas.
[00:37:11.293 --> 00:37:12.734]  They put out false idols.
[00:37:13.054 --> 00:37:17.056]  They put out false templates for us to imitate.
[00:37:17.577 --> 00:37:23.700]  Your children... You know, I go to the gym to ride the exercise bike two or three days a week.
[00:37:25.341 --> 00:37:28.243]  And when I'm there, there'll be television on.
[00:37:28.263 --> 00:37:30.384]  I also have an exercise bike at the house, but...
[00:37:33.519 --> 00:37:36.820]  I don't have weights at the house, so when I'm planning to ride the bike and lift weights, I'll go to the gym.
[00:37:36.840 --> 00:37:38.721]  But why am I telling that part of the story?
[00:37:38.741 --> 00:37:49.585]  The point is that I'm there, and they have ESPN on one big TV in front of the bicycles, and then they've got MTV on the other.
[00:37:50.685 --> 00:37:51.606]  It's not even MTV.
[00:37:51.666 --> 00:37:55.007]  It's some in-house Gold's Gym television.
[00:37:55.729 --> 00:37:57.812]  But it's basically the MTV type stuff.
[00:37:57.912 --> 00:37:59.574]  And every video is the same.
[00:38:00.094 --> 00:38:11.288]  Gyrating women shaking their hips, men walking around showing off Rolex watches getting out of fancy cars, everyone strutting and preening and posing.
[00:38:12.944 --> 00:38:17.566]  And I will look down from the second floor onto the people coming in to the gym.
[00:38:17.626 --> 00:38:19.687]  And you look at them, you can tell insecure body language.
[00:38:19.707 --> 00:38:26.430]  There's these big, huge, muscled guys who look like something out of a...
[00:38:28.442 --> 00:38:29.883]  Hercules book or something.
[00:38:30.063 --> 00:38:31.023]  But you can see their eyes.
[00:38:31.063 --> 00:38:31.744]  They're scared.
[00:38:32.004 --> 00:38:32.504]  They're weak.
[00:38:32.844 --> 00:38:34.685]  They're intimidated.
[00:38:34.785 --> 00:38:40.188]  They're looking around, needing to be worshipped, or they won't feel good about themselves.
[00:38:40.468 --> 00:38:45.611]  The women, no matter how beautiful they are, are totally insecure, totally freaked out.
[00:38:46.271 --> 00:38:47.031]  Almost all of them.
[00:38:47.071 --> 00:38:47.952]  You can just see it.
[00:38:48.192 --> 00:38:53.995]  Because I'll have music on or a book on tape on, so it's like watching TV without the sound.
[00:38:54.015 --> 00:38:56.676]  You really pick up more when you just focus on the body language.
[00:38:57.036 --> 00:38:58.037]  And I just watch it.
[00:38:59.403 --> 00:39:01.264]  I just people watch.
[00:39:01.704 --> 00:39:05.045]  Because I remember being 10 years old and being somewhat inner focused.
[00:39:05.985 --> 00:39:09.927]  By the time I was about 3, I began to not look at myself, at my inner self as much.
[00:39:10.287 --> 00:39:14.348]  And I realized that I was an island and that I didn't really matter.
[00:39:14.408 --> 00:39:17.169]  It was everything around me that that was the world.
[00:39:17.449 --> 00:39:21.510]  But most people never even reach the point of that realization.
[00:39:22.811 --> 00:39:23.331]  And I'm not...
[00:39:25.186 --> 00:39:26.427]  I don't like Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[00:39:26.467 --> 00:39:28.149]  I don't like the things he does and says.
[00:39:28.629 --> 00:39:39.680]  But when I read a book, The Evolution of a Bodybuilder, that he wrote, the one thing I agreed with in it was when he... You know, you read something and you're like, oh, I've thought this so many times.
[00:39:39.940 --> 00:39:42.923]  He talked about how he sees everything outside of him.
[00:39:43.593 --> 00:39:44.615]  I don't even know how I got to this point.
[00:40:00.109 --> 00:40:00.690]  We're good to go.
[00:40:21.608 --> 00:40:39.923]  Imagining that they're this really incredible person, not because of what they've done or who they are or what their beliefs are, but just because they've picked up a template of some false idol, some false model that they're trying to tailor themselves off of.
[00:40:40.825 --> 00:40:43.867]  But I remember having this realization when I was about three years old.
[00:40:43.927 --> 00:40:45.728]  It was like a thunderbolt hit me.
[00:40:45.768 --> 00:40:47.910]  It was a spiritual experience.
[00:40:47.950 --> 00:40:49.791]  I'll never forget it, being about three.
[00:40:50.511 --> 00:40:52.833]  There's more to the story, but I'm not going to get into it.
[00:40:54.254 --> 00:40:54.874]  It's unusual.
[00:40:55.434 --> 00:41:00.478]  But that's not all that happened when I was three years old and that experience in the backyard on that sunny day.
[00:41:00.498 --> 00:41:04.360]  Well, I just felt the presence of God, folks, and there's even more to it.
[00:41:04.400 --> 00:41:08.463]  But the point is that by the time I was ten years old,
[00:41:09.574 --> 00:41:14.377]  I would shift back and forth in the mode of being inwardly focused, outwardly focused.
[00:41:15.077 --> 00:41:29.626]  And then I would catch myself posing or catch myself in my mind imagining that I'm this really cool person off of a template of some Hollywood individual or some sports icon.
[00:41:30.107 --> 00:41:37.771]  And then I would shamefully shift my mind out of that and go, no, I'm Alex Jones and none of that matters and that's just false.
[00:41:40.794 --> 00:41:42.875]  Boy, I'm really getting off into psychology today.
[00:41:42.935 --> 00:41:45.257]  But that's where most people are at.
[00:41:47.398 --> 00:41:50.880]  Most people, well, they've done the psychological test for many decades.
[00:41:51.741 --> 00:41:58.685]  In fact, some of the earliest psychological tests were done on this, where if you put somebody in different costumes, you put somebody in a soldier costume, they act different.
[00:41:58.705 --> 00:42:00.987]  You put them in a sailor costume, they act different.
[00:42:01.027 --> 00:42:03.008]  You put them in a cowboy outfit, they act different.
[00:42:03.268 --> 00:42:09.712]  You put them in a Darth Vader black helmet, black mask, black armored outfit with a submachine gun, you act like a ringwraith.
[00:42:11.457 --> 00:42:18.460]  There's these archetypal symbols, and when you garb yourself in that, it's like on Halloween.
[00:42:18.500 --> 00:42:34.087]  I remember dressing up like a vampire when I'm 12 years old to go run around the neighborhood acting like an idiot, and then acting all crazy in the mirror before I went out, and smashing pumpkins, and nothing too serious.
[00:42:36.128 --> 00:42:36.489]  We're good to go.
[00:42:58.945 --> 00:43:02.426]  That was based in survival and already based in the human coding.
[00:43:02.446 --> 00:43:05.087]  The globalists now are creating false coding.
[00:43:05.287 --> 00:43:26.793]  They're using a base parameter programming off of the human archetypes, but then they're re-entering the equation and then adding false data and giving you false mentors or false templates to follow, and they're taking total control of you, and you're never even reaching basic consciousness.
[00:43:27.466 --> 00:43:31.247]  And I don't mean that as some new agey higher consciousness mumbo jumbo.
[00:43:31.607 --> 00:43:33.748]  I mean you're not even reaching consciousness.
[00:43:34.108 --> 00:43:41.090]  Consciousness that I reached at three years of age, and I'm nobody special folks, television since it came in has done this.
[00:43:41.110 --> 00:43:43.050]  There's all these major studies on it.
[00:43:43.311 --> 00:43:45.251]  It's actually freezing consciousness.
[00:43:45.611 --> 00:43:55.354]  Consciousness is in the upper and lower and dorsal quadrants of the left and right cerebral cortex.
[00:43:55.954 --> 00:44:20.168]  But when you surrender to gladiatorial events, when you surrender to being a spectator, when you shift into the mode of passively drinking something in, that shifts into a subconscious or main data dump area of the brain, and that area gets stronger, whereas the conscious level of the brain atrophies.
[00:44:21.889 --> 00:44:24.851]  And to read Edward Bernays saying this 70 years ago,
[00:44:25.561 --> 00:44:26.022]  We're good to go.
[00:44:42.665 --> 00:44:43.086]  We're good to go.
[00:44:43.106 --> 00:44:43.526]  We're good to go.
[00:45:00.545 --> 00:45:01.285]  That is truth.
[00:45:01.486 --> 00:45:03.586]  That is what they're doing to you.
[00:45:03.867 --> 00:45:22.274]  You realize there are tens of thousands of men and women in white lab coats with 170 IQs, building on 100 years of brain sciences, actively figuring out how to shift you into a mesmerized, suggestible, mindless state.
[00:45:22.555 --> 00:45:25.676]  You are under scientific bombardment.
[00:45:27.080 --> 00:45:32.204]  And I and others are the organic human response to this enemy attack.
[00:45:33.005 --> 00:45:34.286]  Break your conditioning.
[00:45:34.586 --> 00:45:36.167]  Short-circuit their control.
[00:45:36.388 --> 00:45:38.850]  Become consciously aware of what they're doing.
[00:45:39.350 --> 00:45:42.653]  Stop watching television or limit its intake massively.
[00:45:43.093 --> 00:45:47.957]  Force yourself to stay in a conscious mode while watching television.
[00:45:49.640 --> 00:45:51.300]  And then you will see it.
[00:45:51.380 --> 00:45:53.701]  And all of a sudden, you will come out of it.
[00:45:53.741 --> 00:45:54.981]  Just like somebody who's hypnotized.
[00:45:55.441 --> 00:45:58.242]  When I clap or when I snap three times, you're going to wake up.
[00:45:58.502 --> 00:45:59.722]  And you're not going to remember this.
[00:45:59.762 --> 00:46:00.582]  Well, it's the opposite.
[00:46:00.842 --> 00:46:05.263]  When I snap three times, you're going to wake up and you're going to know everything you haven't known.
[00:46:05.543 --> 00:46:11.464]  Believe me, folks, it can happen that quick if you start just trying to realize what's happening.
[00:46:11.544 --> 00:46:12.924]  Trying to look around you.
[00:46:13.244 --> 00:46:14.624]  Trying to understand.
[00:46:14.905 --> 00:46:17.565]  Before you know it, you will just wake up.
[00:46:18.439 --> 00:46:20.480]  Before you know it, you will just flip on.
[00:46:20.540 --> 00:46:21.720]  It's like you're alive.
[00:46:22.680 --> 00:46:27.522]  It's being born again, and I don't even mean it so much in the spiritual sense, which I also believe in.
[00:46:27.542 --> 00:46:29.302]  That's another form of it, even deeper.
[00:46:29.562 --> 00:46:32.143]  I'm talking about your brain will actually turn on.
[00:46:32.343 --> 00:46:33.604]  Your headlights will turn on.
[00:46:33.644 --> 00:46:35.204]  You'll actually be looking outward.
[00:46:35.404 --> 00:46:44.207]  You'll be scanning the world in real time and not in some little feedback loop inside your head like a CD and a CD player skipping, going...
[00:46:46.008 --> 00:46:48.131]  I want you to get out of that.
[00:46:48.331 --> 00:46:49.632]  I want you to turn on.
[00:46:49.652 --> 00:46:51.474]  I want you to activate your brains.
[00:46:51.715 --> 00:46:53.597]  I want you to see what they're doing to you.
[00:46:54.918 --> 00:47:02.987]  But they want to make you a bunch of drugged out invalids who can't run and can't talk and can't touch each other and can't laugh and can't do anything.
[00:47:03.007 --> 00:47:05.710]  Alright, I'm going to shut up and go to your calls.
[00:47:06.930 --> 00:47:15.916]  But we're under mind control, folks, and perhaps I'll start having some more guests on about that, major professors about it, and start covering what's admitted.
[00:47:15.936 --> 00:47:17.397]  This is out in the open.
[00:47:17.417 --> 00:47:25.642]  Do you understand that you can just go down to the UT Psychology Department, if you can get a professor to give you a tour of the, quote, non-classified areas, it's almost all mind control?
[00:47:27.475 --> 00:47:29.056]  Openly Defense Department funded.
[00:47:29.537 --> 00:47:33.139]  Oh yes, in this laboratory we work on how to flicker the TV to make you be more suggestible.
[00:47:33.439 --> 00:47:42.205]  I mean, but you tell the general public who's mesmerized by it, hey, the TV's brainwashing you, not just with the content of it, of the programming, but the flicker rate itself.
[00:47:42.365 --> 00:47:43.606]  Oh yeah!
[00:47:43.646 --> 00:47:45.708]  You watch that X-Files, don't you?
[00:47:46.148 --> 00:47:47.949]  No, buddy, I don't watch the X-Files.
[00:47:48.550 --> 00:47:51.452]  I have watched it before many years ago, but no, this isn't from the X-Files.
[00:47:51.972 --> 00:47:53.493]  Kyle and Mash, you're on the air.
[00:47:53.533 --> 00:47:53.873]  Go ahead.
[00:47:53.913 --> 00:47:54.474]  Thanks for holding.
[00:47:55.374 --> 00:47:56.015]  Is this for Kyle?
[00:47:56.676 --> 00:47:57.517]  Yes, sir, you're on the air.
[00:47:57.957 --> 00:48:00.959]  Yeah, Alex, you must be eating al-qaeda with the way you're talking.
[00:48:00.999 --> 00:48:07.522]  I mean, Bush said to us a while back not to, you know, tolerate outrageous conspiracy theories.
[00:48:08.263 --> 00:48:11.165]  And I'm just thinking... Concerning the attacks on September 11th.
[00:48:11.505 --> 00:48:14.206]  Well, yeah, but I mean, it all relates to what you're talking about.
[00:48:14.487 --> 00:48:18.489]  And what I think, I think it's a good thing that, you know, you're saying America's going down.
[00:48:19.009 --> 00:48:21.991]  We're creating a new America, you know, a new world order.
[00:48:22.792 --> 00:48:25.013]  And I think it's good that we don't allow...
[00:48:25.566 --> 00:48:26.486]  Kids to hug each other.
[00:48:28.007 --> 00:48:31.687]  I think we should go further and create a law in which parents can't do that in front of their kids.
[00:48:32.488 --> 00:48:34.068]  I mean, hugging, touching people's beds.
[00:48:35.928 --> 00:48:37.549]  It makes people feel, you know?
[00:48:38.289 --> 00:48:45.951]  Well, if you write a story, write a fiction article, write an article about cops and robbers, and there's a mention of a gun, you're suspended or arrested.
[00:48:46.931 --> 00:48:48.912]  Well, that's a good law, is what I'm saying.
[00:48:48.932 --> 00:48:49.712]  Exactly, yeah.
[00:48:49.792 --> 00:48:53.573]  It's taking, you know, feelings numb, they kind of make us dumb.
[00:48:53.873 --> 00:48:55.033]  So we should be more analytical.
[00:48:55.931 --> 00:49:07.246]  Yeah, I mean, it really is bad to have kids playing dodgeball or tag, and it's good that they're being arrested when they... Yeah, yeah, because too much endorphins are created in their brains.
[00:49:07.762 --> 00:49:09.402]  You've got to kind of lower the level.
[00:49:09.883 --> 00:49:10.403]  Exactly.
[00:49:10.443 --> 00:49:13.564]  You don't want the intelligence that comes from physical exertion.
[00:49:14.064 --> 00:49:23.046]  I mean, that giddy euphoria of laughing and enjoying themselves because they found that then they're too happy once they go back to class.
[00:49:23.566 --> 00:49:27.507]  That natural recess built in to let the kids blow off steam is just evil.
[00:49:28.028 --> 00:49:29.808]  They've got to sit there and eat their... Exactly.
[00:49:29.848 --> 00:49:35.410]  And the things you're talking about, it's just bringing out too much of those... I don't know, the humanness.
[00:49:35.730 --> 00:49:36.390]  Not the humanness, but
[00:49:37.233 --> 00:49:38.755]  I call it clownness.
[00:49:38.775 --> 00:49:46.604]  You know, people should focus on things that are, you know, more... Well, well... Like, I read Star Magazine, you know?
[00:49:47.605 --> 00:49:49.007]  I think that's a good... You should talk about that.
[00:49:49.047 --> 00:49:50.268]  I watched the Grammys yesterday.
[00:49:50.288 --> 00:49:51.510]  That was interesting, you know?
[00:49:52.899 --> 00:49:53.800]  Then just stop talking.
[00:49:54.060 --> 00:49:55.121]  Well, that is really important.
[00:49:55.141 --> 00:50:05.828]  You know, it doesn't matter that plankton's dying all over the ocean and now becoming infected with different genetically engineered strains of things produced.
[00:50:05.868 --> 00:50:12.793]  It doesn't matter if the whole genomes of plants are being infected and taken over and there's massive ecosystem problems with that.
[00:50:13.334 --> 00:50:14.154]  Everything is fine.
[00:50:14.515 --> 00:50:16.216]  Man, those Hollywood stars are just so cool.
[00:50:16.616 --> 00:50:16.856]  Right.
[00:50:16.916 --> 00:50:18.417]  And Bush knows what he's doing about all that.
[00:50:18.818 --> 00:50:19.578]  All that stuff you mentioned.
[00:50:19.598 --> 00:50:20.439]  You just leave it to him.
[00:50:20.519 --> 00:50:21.720]  He's taking care of it, you know?
[00:50:22.253 --> 00:50:25.114]  I mean, I'm one of those people... I'm on, like, three different drugs.
[00:50:25.995 --> 00:50:29.356]  And it's not really helping me, but, you know... But I'm all for it, you know?
[00:50:29.636 --> 00:50:35.698]  I mean, because... Well, it's illegal to give those drugs to children under three years of age, but they do it anyways.
[00:50:36.559 --> 00:50:37.239]  That's good, too.
[00:50:37.459 --> 00:50:38.099]  That's a good thing.
[00:50:38.260 --> 00:50:39.160]  I'm all for it.
[00:50:39.520 --> 00:50:41.381]  Please stop talking about 9-11.
[00:50:42.121 --> 00:50:43.322]  Stop waking people up, okay?
[00:50:43.682 --> 00:50:44.402]  Okay, I will.
[00:50:45.042 --> 00:50:46.103]  Really, I'll try my best.
[00:50:46.203 --> 00:50:49.044]  And I think it's good they're going to ban knives in England.
[00:50:50.311 --> 00:50:56.955]  And I think it's good that first graders are having the district attorney called on them for sexual harassment.
[00:50:57.635 --> 00:50:58.236]  That's normal.
[00:50:58.496 --> 00:50:58.916]  That's good.
[00:51:02.658 --> 00:51:05.520]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[00:51:05.780 --> 00:51:06.480]  Hello, my friends.

[00:51:19.768 --> 00:51:21.749]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[00:51:21.950 --> 00:51:24.791]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.

[00:54:51.895 --> 00:55:03.147]  John Carpenter, where this organism crashes from space and it takes people over and replicates into their form.
[00:55:03.167 --> 00:55:08.873]  And it can take on the entire history of all the species that it has sampled.
[00:55:09.716 --> 00:55:11.097]  Now, I don't believe in that stuff.
[00:55:11.117 --> 00:55:12.338]  I don't believe in UFOs.
[00:55:12.378 --> 00:55:13.058]  I don't get into it.
[00:55:13.118 --> 00:55:13.979]  It's an analogy.
[00:55:14.519 --> 00:55:29.609]  That is what this chimera cross-species genetic engineering does according to the descriptions and all the science by top scientists, people making millions of dollars a year who have quit and said, I can't be part of this.
[00:55:30.740 --> 00:55:45.496]  When you take insect genes and start sticking them into mammals, and insect genes and start sticking them into plants, plants are so much worse because their genetic code is so much simpler and older that it allows for even more mutation.
[00:55:45.996 --> 00:55:46.977]  We're good to go.
[00:55:47.017 --> 00:55:47.477]  I think?
[00:56:11.229 --> 00:56:11.670]  We're good to go.
[00:56:32.471 --> 00:56:35.973]  Admittedly, admitting that it can give rise to incredibly horrible things.
[00:56:36.353 --> 00:56:39.695]  And a lot of this is going on, the worst stuff is going on in underground U.S.
[00:56:39.755 --> 00:56:40.155]  bases.
[00:56:40.635 --> 00:56:42.677]  And quote, secure level 4 facilities.
[00:56:44.457 --> 00:56:48.520]  And I don't mean to go off and rant about that, but the elite is insane.
[00:56:49.260 --> 00:56:50.681]  They live on this planet too.
[00:56:51.681 --> 00:56:56.063]  And they're doing things, but again, the entire environmental movement has been totally hijacked.
[00:56:56.364 --> 00:56:57.044]  They're just busy...
[00:56:57.955 --> 00:57:09.681]  With the Nature Conservancy and Sierra Club, they're just giant mafia organizations grabbing up private property, and then after they grab it from people, then they take the restrictions off and casinos and hotels and golf courses and luxury homes get built on it.
[00:57:10.461 --> 00:57:19.526]  You see, you get upset about the environment, you rightfully know something's wrong, so then you go give them their support and they're owned by the very same people doing it, and then they just run around and scam everyone.
[00:57:19.546 --> 00:57:22.047]  It just makes me sick.
[00:57:22.087 --> 00:57:22.868]  That's the problem.
[00:57:22.888 --> 00:57:24.809]  There's just so much that's going on.
[00:57:26.889 --> 00:57:30.211]  So in slow motion, that's what this genetic engineering is doing.
[00:57:30.531 --> 00:57:49.504]  Because once you change the basic mass coding, once they open up the genetic code, the spiral helix of the DNA, then once they, because the DNA is normally locked up, once they open Pandora's box, literally Pandora's box is open, and hell itself starts coming out of the DNA.
[00:57:51.721 --> 00:57:53.883]  Because, and again, I believe in God.
[00:57:53.943 --> 00:57:56.825]  I don't get into the whole evolution, creation debate.
[00:57:57.226 --> 00:57:59.808]  Obviously, creation, the evidence of it is all around you.
[00:57:59.848 --> 00:58:02.890]  I believe they create false debates about how that actually took place.
[00:58:02.910 --> 00:58:04.131]  It doesn't matter to me.
[00:58:05.032 --> 00:58:09.375]  All I know is that they've now looked at the DNA, and they've looked at the scientists.
[00:58:09.756 --> 00:58:17.882]  They have gone in and looked at it, and my goodness, the entire DNA of the prehistoric crocodile is in the human helix.
[00:58:18.243 --> 00:58:18.543]  Why?
[00:58:19.292 --> 00:58:20.393]  We don't even come from that.
[00:58:20.433 --> 00:58:25.295]  They admit we're not even on the same line, even if you believe the official theory of evolution.
[00:58:26.175 --> 00:58:30.978]  We don't come from the prehistoric crocodile or the prehistoric alligator.
[00:58:31.298 --> 00:58:32.078]  Why is that?
[00:58:32.418 --> 00:58:34.139]  Why are those genetics there?
[00:58:37.040 --> 00:58:38.241]  It is total creation.
[00:58:38.961 --> 00:58:40.022]  It is all there.
[00:58:41.983 --> 00:58:46.225]  Order a copy of this show for your friends and family at GCNlive.com or call 877-300-7645.
[00:58:58.142 --> 00:58:58.782]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.462 --> 00:59:00.523]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:01.223 --> 00:59:02.364]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.984 --> 00:59:03.805]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.565 --> 00:59:05.425]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.445 --> 00:59:09.768]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.308 --> 00:59:14.430]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:15.871 --> 00:59:19.472]  Welcome back into the second hour.
[00:59:19.492 --> 00:59:24.615]  We're going to go to your calls, and we also have guests lined up for later.
[00:59:26.525 --> 00:59:30.188]  There's so much news here, but for those who just joined us, look at this news.
[00:59:30.228 --> 00:59:32.049]  First graders suspended for sexual harassment.
[00:59:32.549 --> 00:59:34.070]  District attorney contacted.
[00:59:34.090 --> 00:59:37.753]  They may have some criminal charges, though they're saying at this time they're not doing that.
[00:59:38.914 --> 00:59:41.295]  Dodgeball tag being banned now.
[00:59:41.596 --> 00:59:43.397]  Everywhere it was banned, just in some areas.
[00:59:43.437 --> 00:59:45.158]  Now it's almost nationwide.
[00:59:45.178 --> 00:59:47.159]  Total Control England banning knives.
[00:59:48.260 --> 00:59:50.001]  This is how prisoners and slaves live.
[00:59:51.642 --> 00:59:55.045]  Let's go ahead and go to... Who's up next here?
[00:59:57.182 --> 00:59:58.442]  Brian in Pennsylvania.
[00:59:58.462 --> 00:59:59.102]  You're on the air.
[00:59:59.122 --> 00:59:59.762]  Thanks for holding.
[01:00:00.563 --> 01:00:01.323]  Alex, how are you doing?
[01:00:02.123 --> 01:00:02.423]  Question.
[01:00:02.443 --> 01:00:09.824]  There was something in the local newspaper out by me that the state of New Jersey is going to be expanding their DNA database research.
[01:00:10.444 --> 01:00:18.866]  And as you read, they seem to want to convict the criminals that have to be and then go at a quicker pace.
[01:00:18.926 --> 01:00:20.706]  And then the ones that are innocent, they're let go.
[01:00:20.726 --> 01:00:25.947]  But the lie of it is that they say that they take them out of the database computer when really they don't.
[01:00:26.579 --> 01:00:33.662]  And there's been numerous, you know, cases of that where they just, you know, they say one thing and really you're not out of the database.
[01:00:33.722 --> 01:00:34.702]  That's the big lie of it.
[01:00:35.923 --> 01:00:46.367]  In every state in the United States, and also in England, Canada, New Zealand, and Australia, what I call the echelon group of countries that all are in lockstep, basically British Commonwealth countries, and we're back under that now,
[01:00:47.171 --> 01:00:56.617]  Since 33 years ago, anyone 33 years old or younger who was born in a hospital had your blood sent to a federal database.
[01:00:56.657 --> 01:00:57.237]  I've had U.S.
[01:00:57.277 --> 01:00:58.318]  Congressmen on admitting it.
[01:00:58.838 --> 01:00:59.239]  Question.
[01:00:59.619 --> 01:01:07.804]  I was born in 72, so would that mean that, you know, I'm 33 going 34, so that would mean that my... Alex, you were right at the point where it was starting.
[01:01:09.306 --> 01:01:09.726]  Wow.
[01:01:10.067 --> 01:01:20.976]  And the databases, the main suppositories, or depositories, is in Michigan, North Carolina, and I believe L.A.
[01:01:21.997 --> 01:01:22.337]  Wow.
[01:01:22.497 --> 01:01:23.378]  I never knew that.
[01:01:24.218 --> 01:01:25.439]  It's all freeze-dried.
[01:01:26.040 --> 01:01:26.300]  Yeah.
[01:01:27.181 --> 01:01:30.504]  Your baby's blood, if you've had a child in the hospital, is in this freeze-dried.
[01:01:30.524 --> 01:01:33.846]  Unbelievable.
[01:01:33.866 --> 01:01:34.547]  Unbelievable.
[01:01:35.166 --> 01:01:36.207]  This keeps going on and on.
[01:01:36.528 --> 01:01:40.171]  Now, in some cases it's not there because they allow the biotech companies.
[01:01:40.532 --> 01:01:42.494]  There was a federal court ruling three years ago on this.
[01:01:43.034 --> 01:01:46.418]  They own the blood and they buy it from the government database.
[01:01:46.898 --> 01:01:51.963]  And then they find certain properties and certain unique blood samples that they then try to...
[01:01:53.524 --> 01:02:10.873]  Yeah, and the one last thing is it also correlates with the other information you were giving about these private agencies collecting data on American citizens, and then what they do is they collect the data and then the federal government comes and buys the
[01:02:25.196 --> 01:02:36.522]  Which are then political buddies of the politicians who paid them massive campaign contributions, or more often, there's only a few of these companies, one of them is in Kansas City, what they'll do is, excuse me, St.
[01:02:36.562 --> 01:02:45.927]  Louis, but it was an article out of Kansas City where you order the pizza and it instantly runs you through a database to see if you have a, it was in USA Today, to see if you have a warrant, but the
[01:02:46.868 --> 01:03:04.339]  They have these Nexus companies, and they call it a matrix system, and that was the name of the particular system in Florida, where they grab all the data, they then get it because they're, quote, private, then they sell it to the government, but the people owning the companies are former NSA or CIA officers.
[01:03:05.177 --> 01:03:05.398]  Right.
[01:03:05.658 --> 01:03:08.001]  Yeah, they want to hire somebody with a lot of experience.
[01:03:08.061 --> 01:03:09.402]  This is a homeland.
[01:03:09.643 --> 01:03:10.724]  Well, it's an evolving door.
[01:03:10.764 --> 01:03:19.454]  I mean, they go search CIA for 20 years, do all the evil stuff, and then when they get out, when they're 55 or 60, they then get to go run a big company, and it's really still CIA.
[01:03:20.416 --> 01:03:20.656]  Right.
[01:03:22.614 --> 01:03:23.455]  Really interesting.
[01:03:24.195 --> 01:03:25.196]  Total control grid.
[01:03:25.216 --> 01:03:26.377]  It's called fascism, brother.
[01:03:26.397 --> 01:03:27.738]  I hear you.
[01:03:27.758 --> 01:03:28.979]  Thanks a lot, Alex.
[01:03:29.019 --> 01:03:29.399]  You bet.
[01:03:29.439 --> 01:03:30.260]  Good talking to you.
[01:03:30.280 --> 01:03:31.060]  I appreciate your call.
[01:03:31.100 --> 01:03:33.382]  More calls, tons of news coming up.
[01:03:33.442 --> 01:03:34.423]  And I know I move fast.
[01:03:34.443 --> 01:03:38.306]  It's because there's so many facets, so much information to cover.
[01:03:38.686 --> 01:03:41.148]  And yes, your blood is in a federal database.
[01:03:41.889 --> 01:03:43.630]  It is documented.
[01:03:43.750 --> 01:03:45.711]  It has even been in a few mainstream news articles.
[01:03:45.992 --> 01:03:47.633]  But most people are totally unaware of it.
[01:03:50.520 --> 01:03:51.221]  We're good to go.
[01:04:05.760 --> 01:04:14.571]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:04:14.651 --> 01:04:21.579]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:04:21.699 --> 01:04:23.722]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:04:23.942 --> 01:04:34.426]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:04:34.706 --> 01:04:40.048]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.
[01:04:40.568 --> 01:04:43.189]  Visit Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.
[01:04:43.209 --> 01:04:43.790]  Or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[01:04:43.830 --> 01:04:44.330]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:04:44.350 --> 01:04:45.630]  Order today and spread the word.
[01:04:53.308 --> 01:04:56.591]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[01:04:56.651 --> 01:05:00.834]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[01:05:01.074 --> 01:05:03.856]  But if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[01:05:04.056 --> 01:05:06.458]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[01:05:06.638 --> 01:05:15.285]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[01:05:15.485 --> 01:05:16.826]  The Berkey Light is different.
[01:05:17.026 --> 01:05:21.169]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[01:05:21.429 --> 01:05:21.950]  We're good to go.
[01:05:40.512 --> 01:05:43.094]  Get the Advanced Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:05:43.114 --> 01:05:44.034]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:05:53.007 --> 01:05:54.468]  Hey folks, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:05:54.828 --> 01:05:58.771]  You've all heard me on the radio talking about the importance of investing in precious metals.
[01:05:59.151 --> 01:06:02.673]  I feel it's time for me to talk about the importance of investing in your health.
[01:06:03.053 --> 01:06:06.596]  I was presented with the opportunity to try TriVibes from TriVortex.
[01:06:06.996 --> 01:06:11.859]  I was a bit hesitant of the idea of absorbing vitamins by wearing them rather than ingesting them.
[01:06:12.179 --> 01:06:17.981]  After conducting one of the tests found at TriVortex.com, I was convinced that the product might actually work.
[01:06:18.301 --> 01:06:24.443]  I now wear my TriVibes bands daily, and I'm feeling better than ever, not only physically, but also mentally.
[01:06:24.763 --> 01:06:30.545]  TriVortex also offers amazingly beneficial and beautiful jewelry worn by the women around the office daily.
[01:06:30.965 --> 01:06:32.147]  TriVortex is amazing.
[01:06:32.467 --> 01:06:33.588]  Don't take my word for it.
[01:06:33.668 --> 01:06:39.094]  Try TriVortex yourself and have fun and learn with the test found on TriVortex.com.
[01:06:39.294 --> 01:06:42.758]  That's T-R-I-V-O-R-T-E-X dot com.
[01:06:43.038 --> 01:06:44.340]  Or call my friend Brian at 619-884-1455.
[01:06:44.380 --> 01:06:44.660]  That's 619-884-1455.
[01:06:54.873 --> 01:07:00.898]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:07:01.498 --> 01:07:04.540]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:05.721 --> 01:07:08.143]  All right, now back into the second hour.
[01:07:08.203 --> 01:07:10.785]  Ladies and gentlemen, I am honored to be your host.
[01:07:11.425 --> 01:07:13.907]  A caller brought up DNA databases in the last segment.
[01:07:15.188 --> 01:07:18.691]  And, yeah, there's a bunch of news articles out in the last week in the England and the U.S.,
[01:07:19.551 --> 01:07:35.696]  Where, when you get arrested now, basically for any reason, most jurisdictions are taking a tissue swab, thank God, just out of the mouth, because the palate cells on the inside of the cheek of the mucous membrane there are very easy to get off.
[01:07:36.256 --> 01:07:38.257]  In some cases, they just jab a needle in your arm.
[01:07:38.337 --> 01:07:39.177]  It's quite hellish.
[01:07:40.098 --> 01:07:44.322]  And then, quote, when you're found not guilty or you're not prosecuted, they're supposed to expunge that.
[01:07:44.602 --> 01:07:45.623]  But they're not getting rid of it.
[01:07:45.864 --> 01:07:50.628]  And now you hear the federal government going, well, actually, we want to keep it for anybody who's ever arrested, period.
[01:07:50.928 --> 01:07:58.856]  Now in England, if you're pulled over for speeding, they will take the tissue swab out of the inside of the mouth there on the spot.
[01:07:59.665 --> 01:08:00.726]  And here's the problem.
[01:08:01.326 --> 01:08:05.469]  We've caught the Houston Crime Lab, the Dallas Crime Lab, the Tulia Crime Lab.
[01:08:05.749 --> 01:08:08.612]  I can keep going for about 20 minutes listing Texas towns.
[01:08:09.112 --> 01:08:13.855]  I mean, there's hundreds of them who have been caught engaging in fraud.
[01:08:14.376 --> 01:08:19.039]  In fact, I don't know of any crime labs that over the past haven't been caught engaging in fraud.
[01:08:19.640 --> 01:08:26.344]  The police chief had to step down a few years ago in Houston and admit that thousands of people were knowingly framed.
[01:08:26.384 --> 01:08:28.526]  In fact, they didn't ever find anyone they didn't frame.
[01:08:29.170 --> 01:08:35.092]  The Dallas Police Department would just randomly pull cars over that looked nice and throw a bag of chalk in the back and claim it was cocaine.
[01:08:36.233 --> 01:08:37.393]  Truly, it was even worse.
[01:08:38.234 --> 01:08:48.298]  And the FBI crime lab, we've had their former head, Dr. Frederick Whitehurst on here, saying that it was industrialized fraud, a total scam in the forensics and the DNA.
[01:08:49.073 --> 01:08:52.897]  And so notice the media keeps releasing all these, quote, innocent murderers from prison.
[01:08:53.097 --> 01:08:55.759]  And I have no doubt that a lot of them are innocent.
[01:08:56.300 --> 01:08:57.861]  Statistics show around a third of them are.
[01:08:57.881 --> 01:09:00.363]  A third of the people in prison are innocent.
[01:09:01.124 --> 01:09:08.791]  In fact, a lot of times, though, they have already been convicted of another crime, and it's kind of the thought of, well, they should have already stayed in longer because of that, so we're just going to throw the book at this guy.
[01:09:10.410 --> 01:09:13.814]  So, everybody's being taught that DNA is 100%.
[01:09:13.874 --> 01:09:20.301]  Number one, all of our blood, anyone 33 years old or younger who was born in a hospital, is in secret federal databases.
[01:09:20.321 --> 01:09:24.906]  They were secret until about five years ago when it started popping up in the Australian, British, and U.S.
[01:09:24.946 --> 01:09:25.286]  news.
[01:09:25.626 --> 01:09:29.831]  And again, I've had a congressman on a few years ago admitting it, that they have these databases.
[01:09:31.039 --> 01:09:32.840]  So this is going on.
[01:09:32.900 --> 01:09:33.661]  This is happening.
[01:09:34.101 --> 01:09:37.944]  And you cannot trust DNA databases.
[01:09:37.984 --> 01:09:42.207]  And the fact that they want to force us all into it is just nothing more than Big Brother.
[01:09:42.467 --> 01:09:44.028]  All right, I'm really excited about this.
[01:09:44.108 --> 01:09:49.532]  I interviewed her back in 2004 for the 2004 Project Censored Awards.
[01:09:49.972 --> 01:09:50.993]  I was there as a speaker.
[01:09:51.053 --> 01:09:55.256]  She was the keynote speaker in San Francisco.
[01:09:55.636 --> 01:09:57.598]  And, of course, she's a congresswoman from Georgia.
[01:09:58.298 --> 01:10:00.419]  We're good to go.
[01:10:00.539 --> 01:10:00.939]  We're good to go.
[01:10:22.689 --> 01:10:28.873]  She's the only congresswoman that will talk about the toxins in the vaccines and just a host of other issues.
[01:10:28.933 --> 01:10:37.578]  The murder of Martin Luther King by the FBI and the CIA, which I've even interviewed special forces officers who they tried to hire to kill him.
[01:10:37.778 --> 01:10:45.363]  And by the way, the Special Forces Association sued dangerous Dan Marvin, the colonel, and he just beat them in court last week.
[01:10:45.403 --> 01:10:47.264]  So, by the way, that's now been proven in court.
[01:10:47.924 --> 01:10:48.705]  So she's just...
[01:10:49.717 --> 01:10:52.560]  Other than Ron Paul, there's no one with more courage.
[01:10:52.600 --> 01:10:57.624]  And frankly, I haven't heard Ron Paul talking about the jail kidnapping rings that have been government protected.
[01:10:57.964 --> 01:10:59.706]  And I've been trying to get her on for a long time.
[01:10:59.746 --> 01:11:02.328]  She's very busy, and I'm going to keep her as long as we can.
[01:11:02.388 --> 01:11:05.671]  We have literally bugged the daylights out of her staff.
[01:11:05.711 --> 01:11:06.832]  I know how busy she is.
[01:11:07.432 --> 01:11:10.935]  Congresswoman Cynthia McKinney, thank you so much for joining us.
[01:11:11.696 --> 01:11:14.839]  Thank you for the invitation to join you.
[01:11:14.899 --> 01:11:16.100]  Of course, I remember...
[01:11:18.121 --> 01:11:20.063]  With great fondness, actually.
[01:11:21.164 --> 01:11:35.275]  The time that we spent at Project Center and the interview, and of course you were getting an award, so you didn't say that, but one of your stories was one of the most
[01:11:35.879 --> 01:11:41.164]  Censored stories in 2004 and was being honored by Project Censored.
[01:11:41.204 --> 01:11:45.288]  So I guess birds of a feather kind of flock together.
[01:11:45.789 --> 01:11:46.410]  Absolutely.
[01:11:46.550 --> 01:11:53.857]  Of course, you were going to be on yesterday, but you got caught up in flights because you were there for the funeral of Mrs. King.
[01:11:54.658 --> 01:11:57.901]  Yes, I was, and I'm glad you mentioned that.
[01:11:58.582 --> 01:11:59.823]  I wanted to bring that up.
[01:12:01.002 --> 01:12:08.968]  It was an incredible, phenomenal moment to see the four presidents all together.
[01:12:08.988 --> 01:12:23.100]  At the same time, you know, many people commented about how it would take someone of the caliber of Coretta Scott King to bring these four presidents together.
[01:12:23.120 --> 01:12:27.644]  But then we had our current president...
[01:12:29.993 --> 01:12:32.054]  Reading his remarks quite well.
[01:12:33.015 --> 01:12:33.816]  Very unusual.
[01:12:35.337 --> 01:12:44.322]  But then, the showstoppers were President Carter and Reverend Joseph Lowry.
[01:12:45.023 --> 01:12:55.650]  Because Reverend Lowry just put it out there and said, we're in this war, and there's billions for war, but they say there's no money for the poor.
[01:12:56.661 --> 01:13:04.689]  He said, will the promises and the words of today be acted out in the deeds of tomorrow?
[01:13:04.870 --> 01:13:12.658]  Well, it was phenomenal seeing him put Lord Bush on the hot seat, and if more people did that, Bush wouldn't be openly announcing that he's got dictator powers.
[01:13:13.018 --> 01:13:13.718]  I think we're good to go.
[01:13:28.684 --> 01:13:31.206]  Well, remember the comment that he also is supposed to have made about, you know...
[01:13:52.660 --> 01:13:55.801]  It's okay to have a dictatorship as long as he's the dictator.
[01:13:56.101 --> 01:13:56.822]  We have that clip.
[01:13:56.842 --> 01:13:57.422]  Guys, find that.
[01:13:57.442 --> 01:13:57.742]  Go ahead.
[01:13:58.202 --> 01:14:01.624]  So, all of this is a pattern.
[01:14:02.064 --> 01:14:08.126]  And I'm shocked that he can find so many people who will go along with him.
[01:14:08.727 --> 01:14:10.747]  I was just reviewing that...
[01:14:12.724 --> 01:14:14.365]  There were judges who were told.
[01:14:14.446 --> 01:14:16.647]  There were members of Congress who were told.
[01:14:17.608 --> 01:14:31.818]  And, you know, at the end of the day, the bottom line on all of this is that I have co-sponsored John Conyers' impeachment study legislation because I think that
[01:14:32.498 --> 01:14:38.262]  By far, we have too many examples of high crimes and more than misdemeanors.
[01:14:38.322 --> 01:14:43.126]  By the way, that's going to be Mr. Oberman's main news piece tonight.
[01:14:44.066 --> 01:14:45.247]  Can Bush be impeached?
[01:14:45.287 --> 01:14:46.068]  How would it happen?
[01:14:46.288 --> 01:14:47.889]  So that's going to be MSNBC tonight.
[01:14:48.724 --> 01:14:58.051]  Oh, well, you know, really, all it takes is the American people expressing their will in a very public way.
[01:14:58.532 --> 01:15:09.761]  We have to have the 218 votes in the House, and we have to have 51 votes in the Senate, but we can get that if the people...
[01:15:10.661 --> 01:15:20.105]  ...desire to have this administration, which quite frankly, was stolen in 2000, and was stolen again in 2004.
[01:15:20.565 --> 01:15:27.148]  And there are not many people who will talk about that, or who want to talk about that.
[01:15:27.548 --> 01:15:36.952]  Congressman Ron Paul, one of your colleagues a month ago on this broadcast, said that he believes Bush is actually trying to set up a dictatorship and may start putting American citizens in camps.
[01:15:37.232 --> 01:15:38.693]  I mean, Ron Paul's never gone that far.
[01:15:39.520 --> 01:15:55.374]  Well, I mean, I'm looking at the host of articles, the news articles that will appear one time in one publication, and then you don't hear anything more about it.
[01:15:55.434 --> 01:15:55.955]  Well, hang on.
[01:15:56.195 --> 01:15:59.077]  Halliburton just got contracts to build camps in America.
[01:15:59.418 --> 01:16:00.598]  That's exactly right.
[01:16:00.659 --> 01:16:01.739]  That's exactly right.
[01:16:01.819 --> 01:16:11.247]  And so, now we have to look at not just each one of these single headlines that appears in one place at one time.
[01:16:12.568 --> 01:16:17.932]  In isolation, we have to look at the pattern and practice of this administration.
[01:16:18.352 --> 01:16:24.557]  And if they had the guts and the gall to steal the election... And I want to bring to your attention...
[01:16:25.578 --> 01:16:38.446]  The movie, the film, a documentary film by the name of American Blackout.
[01:16:39.106 --> 01:16:52.675]  Now, while this film focuses somewhat on my political career, it also explains in the clearest of detail so that there is no doubt by anyone
[01:16:53.630 --> 01:17:00.634]  How the election was stolen in 2000, and again, how the election was stolen in 2004.
[01:17:01.715 --> 01:17:06.258]  It's clearly depicted in the film, American Blackout.
[01:17:06.898 --> 01:17:08.940]  Well, we'll have to talk about that, and we're about to break.
[01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:17.245]  I want to come back and get into DynCorp, because last year in March, during the Defense Armed Services Committee budgetary meetings, we have a clip we're going to play later,
[01:17:17.845 --> 01:17:19.587]  You brought up three key points.
[01:17:20.448 --> 01:17:22.450]  Dyncor and the child kidnapping rings.
[01:17:22.850 --> 01:17:25.733]  You brought up the drills on 9-11.
[01:17:25.973 --> 01:17:28.335]  And you brought up trillions missing from the Pentagon.
[01:17:28.636 --> 01:17:35.943]  And we still haven't gotten answers on any of this, and I don't know if you're aware of it, but the Chicago Tribune ran an article three weeks ago, two articles,
[01:17:36.483 --> 01:17:40.304]  Okay, I would love very much to hear what you have.
[01:18:05.992 --> 01:18:08.614]  And, of course, more details about the film Blackout.
[01:18:08.654 --> 01:18:14.798]  We're about to break here, and we'll come right back and get into that with Congresswoman Cynthia McKinney.
[01:18:14.838 --> 01:18:17.080]  We'll also give you her website.
[01:18:17.120 --> 01:18:18.641]  You really need to visit it.
[01:18:18.681 --> 01:18:33.312]  Just go to house.gov, and if you type in McKinney into the search engine, she is a congresswoman, of course, from the great state of Georgia, and I'm really excited about having her on because she does not pull punches.
[01:18:33.332 --> 01:18:34.433]  She does not back off.
[01:18:35.074 --> 01:18:39.401]  And she exposes the evil that is right out in the open.
[01:18:39.741 --> 01:18:41.765]  So again, please stay with us everybody.
[01:18:42.045 --> 01:18:45.230]  Congresswoman Cynthia McKinney on the other side of this quick break.
[01:18:45.250 --> 01:18:46.032]  We'll be right back.
[01:18:54.474 --> 01:18:56.816]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here with an important question.

[01:21:19.328 --> 01:21:31.111]  It also removes foul taste and odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:21:31.591 --> 01:21:36.053]  The Berkey Light's rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.

[01:22:20.151 --> 01:22:20.611]  We're good to go.
[01:22:37.165 --> 01:22:38.246]  By the way...
[01:23:00.390 --> 01:23:06.854]  Bush has said two separate times things would be a heck of a lot easier if this was a dictatorship just so long as I'm the dictator.
[01:23:07.514 --> 01:23:09.276]  And Congresswoman had mentioned that earlier.
[01:23:09.316 --> 01:23:10.977]  Let's go ahead and roll that short clip.
[01:23:10.997 --> 01:23:11.397]  Here it is.
[01:23:11.417 --> 01:23:20.943]  I hope they've got my sense of optimism about the possible and enthusiasm about the job.
[01:23:22.404 --> 01:23:27.387]  I've told all four that there are going to be some times where we don't agree with each other.
[01:23:28.707 --> 01:23:29.428]  But that's okay if
[01:23:30.538 --> 01:23:32.880]  If this were a dictatorship, it'd be a heck of a lot easier.
[01:23:34.402 --> 01:23:36.064]  Just so long as I'm the dictator.
[01:23:36.764 --> 01:23:43.171]  And that was during the campaign on a live discussion on CNN at a town hall meeting.
[01:23:43.411 --> 01:23:44.833]  Congresswoman, there's that clip.
[01:23:45.433 --> 01:23:46.534]  That's incredible.
[01:23:46.654 --> 01:23:53.902]  But, I mean, you know, and the things that we have to beware of, the things that George W. Bush said,
[01:23:54.709 --> 01:23:57.110]  jokes about because they're not jokes at all.
[01:23:57.170 --> 01:24:00.250]  In fact, they may indeed be jokes on the American people.
[01:24:00.771 --> 01:24:20.936]  Right now, I'm looking at the financial health of our country and I'm wondering why, obviously, someone's purposes are served by having these tremendous deficits and the national debt.
[01:24:21.336 --> 01:24:22.676]  We just raised
[01:24:23.226 --> 01:24:32.895]  The debt ceiling from 7.9 around trillion to 8 trillion.
[01:24:32.975 --> 01:24:35.917]  And I'm trying to figure out what is it that...
[01:24:37.276 --> 01:24:39.097]  Who is being served by this?
[01:24:39.117 --> 01:24:41.218]  Obviously the American people aren't being served by this.
[01:24:41.238 --> 01:24:46.361]  Well, the big central banks that own and run this country, and by the way, that $8-plus trillion is only what we currently owe.
[01:24:48.262 --> 01:24:55.686]  What we've signed on to our obligations, according to the Dallas Morning News, is $70-plus trillion, and that was two years ago they reported that.
[01:24:56.586 --> 01:24:57.486]  Well, so...
[01:24:59.190 --> 01:25:16.217]  Now, obviously, you've done a whole lot of research on this, and I'm going to have to do a little bit more because it's incredible to me that the American people will allow this kind of financial stewardship to be done to their country.
[01:25:16.317 --> 01:25:20.379]  But it's conservative to spend more money than all previous presidents combined.
[01:25:21.059 --> 01:25:26.101]  Well, that's what they say they are, but obviously they're serving some purpose, some purpose.
[01:25:26.428 --> 01:25:31.229]  Some authority higher than, other than the American people.
[01:25:31.489 --> 01:25:32.230]  Boy, you said it.
[01:25:32.490 --> 01:25:34.130]  And who do you think that is?
[01:25:34.210 --> 01:25:38.471]  Well, I don't know, but also I have to question about the war.
[01:25:38.531 --> 01:25:44.973]  So I'm trying to read up now on the Federal Reserve, and I'm really trying to understand and learn.
[01:25:45.713 --> 01:25:48.775]  And then, of course, we come to the war.
[01:25:49.575 --> 01:25:52.797]  And whose purpose is being served by this war?
[01:25:52.917 --> 01:25:55.698]  It certainly, again, is not the American people.
[01:25:55.799 --> 01:26:00.101]  And I'm going to get the Quadrennial Defense Review.
[01:26:00.181 --> 01:26:00.761]  I've got that.
[01:26:00.801 --> 01:26:13.448]  I brought that so that I could get my head around what it is that Rumsfeld and the Pentagon Boys are actually telling us about this long war.
[01:26:14.188 --> 01:26:17.549]  And I'm still trying to figure out who the enemy is.
[01:26:17.669 --> 01:26:20.090]  By the way, Bush has said it's going to last 100 years.
[01:26:20.170 --> 01:26:22.450]  Cheney said three generations.
[01:26:23.091 --> 01:26:28.712]  And meanwhile, they're steamrolling towards a conflagration with Iran.
[01:26:28.752 --> 01:26:31.313]  Give us your take on the Iran situation, Congresswoman.
[01:26:31.813 --> 01:26:41.716]  There is no way that I can sanction more war because we don't even have justification for the one that we're in.
[01:26:42.698 --> 01:26:56.740]  And I'm anxiously awaiting the outcome of the investigations from Patrick Fitzgerald and also McNulty on the fabrication of the...
[01:26:58.183 --> 01:27:05.206]  The so-called intelligence that said that Saddam and all of that... Saddam was our guy.
[01:27:05.227 --> 01:27:06.787]  I shouldn't say our.
[01:27:07.227 --> 01:27:09.309]  But he was America's boy.
[01:27:09.349 --> 01:27:13.170]  Those authorities installed Saddam in power.
[01:27:13.190 --> 01:27:14.191]  Have you heard about the new...
[01:27:14.431 --> 01:27:15.992]  Well, I mean, we can go all the way back to 2001.
[01:27:41.061 --> 01:27:45.544]  The failure to protect the American people on September 11th.
[01:27:45.884 --> 01:27:50.327]  That's the first high crime and more than misdemeanor.
[01:27:50.367 --> 01:27:51.908]  What about the 9-11 truth scholars?
[01:27:52.188 --> 01:27:57.552]  Professors and doctors and demolition experts are saying the official story's a fraud.
[01:27:59.393 --> 01:28:02.535]  Well, I've seen those reports.
[01:28:02.895 --> 01:28:08.279]  I mean, well, the more people who say it's... I mean, it's clear that there was...
[01:28:09.814 --> 01:28:17.299]  Something was terribly amiss on that day with our people who were in charge and then they didn't do anything.
[01:28:17.339 --> 01:28:19.720]  They didn't even follow standard operating procedure.
[01:28:20.020 --> 01:28:21.101]  They stood down, didn't they?
[01:28:22.142 --> 01:28:22.382]  Yes.
[01:28:24.123 --> 01:28:24.903]  Congresswoman, stay there.
[01:28:24.923 --> 01:28:26.084]  We've got plenty of time when we get back.
[01:28:26.104 --> 01:28:30.987]  She was with us for the whole hour, the whole rest of the hour, lavishing us with her time.
[01:28:31.327 --> 01:28:32.208]  We're so honored to have her.
[01:28:32.408 --> 01:28:33.208]  We're going to get into 9-11.
[01:28:33.228 --> 01:28:38.732]  We're going to get into the dying core behavior that she has exposed and so much more after this quick break.
[01:28:38.752 --> 01:28:39.152]  Stay with us.
[01:28:44.275 --> 01:28:45.157]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.657 --> 01:28:47.260]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:48.201 --> 01:28:50.865]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:54.426 --> 01:29:01.288]  For months now, you've been hearing about the incredible health benefits of Zango, the functional health beverage made from the whole fruit of mangosteen.
[01:29:01.428 --> 01:29:14.352]  What you probably didn't know is that Zango joined forces with the leading manufacturer and distributor of functional health beverages like Capri Sun, Sobe, Mystic, and Red Bull to create the fastest growing business opportunity in America today.
[01:29:14.552 --> 01:29:16.333]  Are you sick of barely having enough money?
[01:29:16.513 --> 01:29:19.974]  Are you tired of working so hard yet feeling like you'll never get ahead?
[01:29:20.254 --> 01:29:24.035]  Are you ready to start investing in your own business instead of somebody else's?
[01:29:24.295 --> 01:29:29.256]  Whatever it is you seek, Zango could be the special company that helps you achieve your hopes and dreams.
[01:29:29.516 --> 01:29:31.237]  So take matters into your own hands.
[01:29:31.497 --> 01:29:35.478]  Create a future that doesn't depend on a fickle 401k and lateral promotions.
[01:29:35.718 --> 01:29:37.538]  Zango is what you are looking for.

[01:30:07.359 --> 01:30:13.825]  The revolutionary Berkey Light removes pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, and harmful or unwanted chemicals.
[01:30:14.065 --> 01:30:14.666]  We're good to go.
[01:30:32.242 --> 01:30:32.682]  We're good to go.
[01:30:32.722 --> 01:30:33.343]  We're good to go.
[01:30:33.403 --> 01:30:33.963]  We're good to go.
[01:30:53.553 --> 01:30:57.601]  People who use Cardivite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[01:30:57.821 --> 01:31:01.228]  For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself time-tested.
[01:31:01.408 --> 01:31:04.835]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite.
[01:31:05.143 --> 01:31:08.364]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[01:31:08.404 --> 01:31:13.867]  This basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the diseases that we see.
[01:31:13.907 --> 01:31:23.531]  When we do our program, you know, herbal formulas like Cardavite, and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill now going for a regular job a few months later, we know we're doing something right.
[01:31:23.671 --> 01:31:24.952]  It's a well-thought-out formula.
[01:31:24.992 --> 01:31:30.454]  I mean, the idea of it working on yeast and metals both at the same time and liver function is dead on.
[01:31:30.954 --> 01:31:35.437]  You'll find, I think, that it'll work more just on heart problems and circulation problems.
[01:31:35.457 --> 01:31:36.838]  It'll work on other problems as well.
[01:31:36.998 --> 01:31:40.820]  For more information, call 1-877-928-8822 or visit our website at www.heartdrop.com.

[01:31:59.008 --> 01:32:00.909]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:32:01.389 --> 01:32:04.190]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:32:04.850 --> 01:32:07.271]  Crashing to the lies and disinformation.
[01:32:07.371 --> 01:32:15.695]  And the very fact this radio show is exploding in popularity, number one on ShopCast, Internet listenership, new AM and FM affiliates every week.
[01:32:16.215 --> 01:32:16.756]  We're good to go.
[01:32:33.975 --> 01:32:34.295]  No.
[01:32:34.936 --> 01:32:39.318]  Five other books on the subject at Infowars.com in the video and bookstore.
[01:32:39.358 --> 01:32:41.199]  Go there and shop and get your copies today.
[01:32:41.439 --> 01:32:45.241]  And with my documentaries, you're authorized to make copies and pass them around.
[01:32:45.561 --> 01:32:50.743]  There's no copyright for non-profit educational purposes because my goal is just to try to save this country.
[01:32:51.043 --> 01:32:54.325]  And that happens when you get involved and support people like Cynthia McKinney.
[01:32:54.945 --> 01:32:56.585]  Congresswoman, I want to play this little clip.
[01:32:56.605 --> 01:32:57.446]  That's about ten minutes long.
[01:32:57.466 --> 01:32:58.806]  I'm only going to hear about two minutes of it.
[01:32:59.826 --> 01:33:01.286]  This is last March.
[01:33:01.306 --> 01:33:02.507]  We're going to put you right back on hold.
[01:33:02.707 --> 01:33:04.747]  This is when you imagine being a few feet.
[01:33:04.807 --> 01:33:10.188]  She's on the bottom row, a few feet from Rumsfeld, the Dark Lord himself, Darth Sidious.
[01:33:10.688 --> 01:33:18.330]  And she's there exposing him and Myers and all these other people and Dr. Chu and the rest of them that are sitting there.
[01:33:18.430 --> 01:33:23.151]  And she brings forward documented, hardcore questions that no one dare ask.
[01:33:23.471 --> 01:33:24.091]  Listen to this.
[01:33:26.244 --> 01:33:28.426]  I have just one question.
[01:33:29.807 --> 01:33:36.033]  Who are we and who's responsible for what we've become?
[01:33:36.834 --> 01:33:46.583]  As I survey the landscape of the changes that have taken place literally before my eyes over the course of my lifetime, I have to wonder, where did we go wrong?
[01:33:48.084 --> 01:34:07.533]  George W. smirks, Dick Cheney sneers, Rumsfeld jokes, Powell blusters, Rice lies, Enron and WorldCom steal, DynCorp vaccinate, Halliburton feeds and feeds and feeds and feeds.
[01:34:09.474 --> 01:34:13.696]  Americans hurt, and in Iraq, Americans die.
[01:34:14.841 --> 01:34:31.340]  Our national leaders insult our allies, create more foes, reward their friends, increase our insecurity through their own policies and plunge the American people into the deepest economic abyss of a generation.
[01:34:32.404 --> 01:34:34.825]  Now, we've sent so many clips of Congresswoman McKinney.
[01:34:34.845 --> 01:34:36.946]  That is from her speech at the Project Central Awards.
[01:34:36.986 --> 01:34:42.648]  And we'll play the little two-minute clip later, but that was a good clip to play of her confronting Rumsfeld.
[01:34:42.708 --> 01:34:44.009]  So that's also in the computer.
[01:34:45.249 --> 01:34:47.630]  Scott, we must have mislabeled that when we emailed it to you.
[01:34:47.690 --> 01:34:48.411]  They're up in Minnesota.
[01:34:48.451 --> 01:34:50.851]  I'm down here in Austin, Texas at our studios here.
[01:34:50.871 --> 01:34:51.752]  So we'll get that clip.
[01:34:52.332 --> 01:34:55.854]  But, Congresswoman, you confronted Rumsfeld.
[01:34:56.034 --> 01:35:01.836]  And can you tell people about what you said to him and the issue of DynCorp and now Halliburton?
[01:35:02.376 --> 01:35:08.882]  Well, yeah, I mean, that's one incredible moment.
[01:35:09.102 --> 01:35:18.190]  And I've had a lot of people say to me, well, you know, he just hasn't been around enough black people because he would know that black women would talk like that.
[01:35:20.369 --> 01:35:22.910]  But, you know, I just asked him about the war games.
[01:35:22.990 --> 01:35:30.711]  I asked him about DynCorp and why weren't they ever... He said that, you know, companies get inside the penalty box.
[01:35:30.751 --> 01:35:32.312]  Well, they were never in the penalty box.
[01:35:33.072 --> 01:35:42.594]  And it's my understanding that not only is it DynCorp, but it's Halliburton, too, that's engaging in the sexual slave trade of women and little girls.
[01:35:43.374 --> 01:35:47.575]  And not only in Eastern Europe, but in Iraq today.
[01:35:48.268 --> 01:35:53.330]  And so, who in the end is actually going to care?
[01:35:53.810 --> 01:35:54.590]  Who cares?
[01:35:55.330 --> 01:35:58.611]  And we've got 535 members of Congress.
[01:35:59.252 --> 01:36:00.232]  Who cares?
[01:36:00.332 --> 01:36:01.052]  Who cares?
[01:36:01.512 --> 01:36:02.853]  We all have to care.
[01:36:02.893 --> 01:36:04.673]  The American people have to care.
[01:36:05.774 --> 01:36:07.414]  Nearly 300 million of us.
[01:36:07.934 --> 01:36:13.056]  We have to care and we cannot allow people to get away with stealing elections.
[01:36:13.713 --> 01:36:18.314]  And they steal elections with the same ease that they steal women and little girls.
[01:36:19.615 --> 01:36:36.660]  One of the questions that I asked was, how come the Pentagon is such an egregious offender when the time comes for auditing its resources that are given to it by Congress?
[01:36:37.382 --> 01:36:40.844]  And one of the responses is that their computers don't talk to each other.
[01:36:41.345 --> 01:36:43.806]  So I asked, well, who's got the contracts?
[01:36:43.886 --> 01:36:52.792]  And Madam Comptroller of the Pentagon, Jonas, is sitting there, and she refuses to tell me who's got the contracts
[01:36:53.317 --> 01:36:55.838]  ...to make the computers talk to each other.
[01:36:55.858 --> 01:37:05.283]  Now, of course, imagine if some private company had billions of dollars, and in this case it's trillions, now 3.6 plus trillion, that's Associated Press missing over the last eight years.
[01:37:05.783 --> 01:37:10.225]  Now, imagine bringing this up, and then they just say, oh, our computers don't communicate.
[01:37:10.245 --> 01:37:11.466]  So when the IRS is auditing...
[01:37:12.366 --> 01:37:19.409]  Auditing you over a few thousand dollars, folks, you say, oh, I'm sorry, my computers don't communicate, and then a few years later you won't get in any trouble.
[01:37:19.709 --> 01:37:25.211]  I mean, obviously there is massive fraud going on when they can't account for trillions of dollars.
[01:37:25.592 --> 01:37:37.857]  That's exactly right, which leads me, now, her response was $20 billion has been spent already trying to make the computers talk to each other.
[01:37:38.857 --> 01:37:39.537]  $20 billion!
[01:37:39.858 --> 01:37:40.518]  How many...
[01:37:42.119 --> 01:37:54.046]  Computer programmers and software experts and these companies that we have that could do so much more than whatever the company is.
[01:37:54.126 --> 01:37:56.868]  It's got this $20 billion worth of contract.
[01:37:56.928 --> 01:37:58.589]  But they're saying that we should... They've done nothing!
[01:37:58.769 --> 01:38:00.070]  They're saying we should just trust them.
[01:38:00.110 --> 01:38:01.411]  In fact, we now have that clip.
[01:38:01.451 --> 01:38:02.391]  Here's the little clip.
[01:38:02.411 --> 01:38:03.192]  Go ahead and roll it.
[01:38:04.292 --> 01:38:05.713]  Gentlelady from Georgia, Ms.
[01:38:05.753 --> 01:38:06.153]  McKinney.
[01:38:07.314 --> 01:38:08.555]  Oh, thank you, Mr. Chairman.
[01:38:10.270 --> 01:38:23.500]  Mr. Secretary, I watched President Bush deliver a moving speech at the United Nations in September 2003, in which he mentioned the crisis of the sex trade.
[01:38:24.401 --> 01:38:28.524]  The President called for the punishment of those involved in this horrible business.
[01:38:29.285 --> 01:38:37.551]  But at the very moment of that speech, DynCorp was exposed for having been involved in the buying and selling of young women and children.
[01:38:38.547 --> 01:38:51.196]  While all of this was going on, DynCorp kept the Pentagon contract to administer the smallpox and anthrax vaccines and is now working on a plague vaccine through the Joint Vaccine Acquisition Program.
[01:38:52.497 --> 01:38:54.659]  Mr. Secretary, is it policy of the U.S.
[01:38:54.719 --> 01:38:58.182]  government to reward companies that traffic in women and little girls?
[01:38:58.882 --> 01:39:00.003]  That's my first question.
[01:39:00.063 --> 01:39:05.147]  My second question, Mr. Secretary, according to the Comptroller General of the United States,
[01:39:05.782 --> 01:39:11.343]  There are serious financial management problems at the Pentagon, to which Mr. Cooper alluded.
[01:39:12.084 --> 01:39:15.384]  Fiscal year 1999, $2.3 trillion missing.
[01:39:15.965 --> 01:39:19.125]  Fiscal year 2000, $1.1 trillion missing.
[01:39:19.966 --> 01:39:24.687]  And DOD is the number one reason why the government can't balance its checkbook.
[01:39:25.627 --> 01:39:32.909]  The Pentagon has claimed year after year that the reason it can't account for the money is because its computers don't communicate with each other.
[01:39:33.689 --> 01:39:41.072]  My second question, Mr. Secretary, is who has the contracts today to make those systems communicate with each other?
[01:39:41.693 --> 01:39:44.114]  How long have they had those contracts?
[01:39:44.734 --> 01:39:47.195]  And how much have the taxpayers paid for them?
[01:39:47.995 --> 01:39:57.660]  Finally, Mr. Secretary, after the last hearing, I thought that my office was promised a written response to my question regarding the four war games on September 11th.
[01:39:58.740 --> 01:40:11.225]  I have not yet received that response, but would like for you to respond to the questions that I've put to you today, and then I do expect the written response to my previous question, hopefully by the end of the week.
[01:40:14.086 --> 01:40:17.148]  Thank you, Representative.
[01:40:17.188 --> 01:40:21.529]  First, the answer to your first question is no, absolutely not.
[01:40:21.649 --> 01:40:27.912]  The policy of the United States government is clear, unambiguous, and opposed
[01:40:28.717 --> 01:40:31.638]  To the activities that you described.
[01:40:32.459 --> 01:40:35.700]  The second question.
[01:40:35.720 --> 01:40:45.285]  Well, how do you explain the fact that Dyncor and its successor companies have received and continue to receive government contracts?
[01:40:46.925 --> 01:40:54.749]  I would have to go and find the facts, but there are laws and rules and regulations with respect to government contracts
[01:40:55.495 --> 01:41:01.740]  And there are times that corporations do things they should not do, in which case they tend to be suspended for some period.
[01:41:02.200 --> 01:41:20.455]  There are times then that under the laws and the rules and regulations passed by the Congress and implemented by the executive branch, that corporations can get off of the penalty box, if you will, and be permitted to engage in contracts with the government.
[01:41:20.475 --> 01:41:23.577]  They're generally not barred in perpetuity.
[01:41:23.797 --> 01:41:24.738]  This contract
[01:41:25.146 --> 01:41:29.051]  This company was never in the penalty box.
[01:41:29.251 --> 01:41:30.752]  Okay, that's enough.
[01:41:30.792 --> 01:41:31.473]  It goes on and on.
[01:41:31.513 --> 01:41:32.234]  It gets even worse.
[01:41:32.254 --> 01:41:33.335]  But see, there's no denial of this.
[01:41:33.375 --> 01:41:40.023]  It's been BBC, London Telegraph, Agency French Press, Le Figaro, Der Spiegel.
[01:41:40.043 --> 01:41:44.148]  200,000 women and children flown out to different hell holes around the world.
[01:41:44.688 --> 01:41:52.419]  Slave labor, sex slaves sold into these sweat houses, these sweat shops.
[01:41:52.779 --> 01:41:53.741]  This is all admitted.
[01:41:53.801 --> 01:42:01.532]  Now the Chicago Tribune comes out in a two-part series a few weeks ago and says that DynCorp, and Halliburton's involved now too,
[01:42:02.292 --> 01:42:03.593]  It's incredible.
[01:42:03.753 --> 01:42:04.694]  And at one point, I...
[01:42:33.068 --> 01:42:37.090]  I said that a criminal syndicate had taken over Washington, D.C.
[01:42:37.170 --> 01:42:41.691]  And, you know, upon reflection, I said, well, maybe I was hard on this administration.
[01:42:41.791 --> 01:42:46.653]  But now, what are we, five years later?
[01:42:46.673 --> 01:42:51.334]  That doesn't hardly describe what we've got going on.
[01:42:52.295 --> 01:42:55.676]  It is as if our treasury is being looted.
[01:42:56.156 --> 01:43:02.261]  Which is another area that we need to pay attention to.
[01:43:02.381 --> 01:43:04.083]  What's happening to our economy?
[01:43:04.523 --> 01:43:16.193]  It appears to me that our country is literally being hollowed out in very much the same way that the city of New Orleans has been hollowed out of its people.
[01:43:16.633 --> 01:43:19.636]  It seems that our economy is being hollowed out.
[01:43:21.940 --> 01:43:28.226]  The American people, I don't know what is financially in store for the average American person.
[01:43:28.527 --> 01:43:45.423]  Now, in addition to this discussion about long war and us being in war for the next generation or several next generations, we have to also pay attention to how we are treating our young men and women, and not so young now because they're...
[01:43:46.624 --> 01:43:53.486]  Telling people that they've got to report for service in Iraq, and they're age 40.
[01:43:53.746 --> 01:43:54.847]  63 years old with cancer.
[01:43:56.047 --> 01:43:56.367]  Yes.
[01:43:56.947 --> 01:44:06.730]  And then now when you get your body shattered, your body armor blown to pieces, they cut it off of you in the emergency field hospital and then charge you $700 for it and $4 a day for your meals.
[01:44:07.270 --> 01:44:08.371]  That's exactly right.
[01:44:08.431 --> 01:44:12.832]  But now, at least, I mean, you know, we had reports...
[01:44:13.824 --> 01:44:23.390]  Right after, in 2001, about Halliburton food making our men and women sick over in Afghanistan.
[01:44:23.470 --> 01:44:32.695]  And then a group protested it in Houston to the employees, warning them, and the Pentagon Army troops spied on them, but Bush says he's not spying on Americans.
[01:44:33.215 --> 01:44:45.124]  Now, if my phone is going in and out, because I only hear, like, every other word you're saying when I'm lucky, and that's because that's what my phone does all the time.
[01:44:45.184 --> 01:44:50.048]  So I would apologize to the audience if I am even going in and out.
[01:44:50.428 --> 01:44:58.875]  It's not someone calling me, but it's the condition of my phone line, and it always does that, no matter who I'm talking to.
[01:44:59.455 --> 01:45:05.259]  I do want to take this opportunity to mention also the case of Kevin Benderman.
[01:45:05.359 --> 01:45:08.981]  I don't know if you have talked about Kevin Benderman.
[01:45:09.021 --> 01:45:09.241]  Yes.
[01:45:09.261 --> 01:45:14.765]  He's in prison because he is a conscientious objector.
[01:45:16.086 --> 01:45:16.726]  Tell us about it.
[01:45:17.433 --> 01:45:27.715]  Well, we were contacted, I guess maybe a year ago, because Sergeant Benjamin had been to Iraq one time.
[01:45:28.115 --> 01:45:41.538]  He had seen the senseless killing, the killing of civilians, the killing of women, the killing of children, and he said, I am not going to go back and participate in this kind of behavior.
[01:45:41.598 --> 01:45:43.439]  This behavior is not me.
[01:45:44.833 --> 01:45:55.376]  And so, um, he filed out, he, uh, filed a request for, uh, consideration as a, uh, conscientious objector.
[01:45:56.256 --> 01:45:58.057]  And, um, it was denied.
[01:45:58.917 --> 01:46:07.059]  And so now he's in prison because, in, uh, near Seattle, Washington, because he didn't want to go kill people anymore.
[01:46:07.560 --> 01:46:12.641]  Now, you know, you, of all people, Alex, remember that what...
[01:46:13.759 --> 01:46:24.408]  Certain areas of our government have always wanted is to be able to produce a killing machine that was devoid of remorse.
[01:46:25.630 --> 01:46:35.238]  And so that's why it's important for the MKUltra program,
[01:46:36.174 --> 01:46:46.157]  And other programs of the past that were trying to do this kind of killing without remorse to turn our soldiers into killing machines.
[01:46:46.577 --> 01:46:48.878]  Well, our soldiers are not killing machines.
[01:46:49.398 --> 01:46:57.581]  And this Sergeant Benderman is someone who doesn't want to kill, and he shouldn't be in prison because he doesn't want to kill innocent women and little children.
[01:46:58.101 --> 01:47:07.275]  And by the way, for those that don't know, right in front of the Baghdad Hotel, about six months into the occupation, they'd machine-gunned a bunch of little kids that were throwing rocks.
[01:47:08.076 --> 01:47:13.184]  And a big British reporter yelled at the Marines and said, How dare you do this?
[01:47:14.740 --> 01:47:18.641]  And the Marines yelled back, we love killing them and we're going to kill more.
[01:47:19.121 --> 01:47:27.923]  And there have been London Telegraph articles about troops just shooting, snipers just shooting women, walking with their kids down the road for fun and going, look at me blow that bitch's head off.
[01:47:28.204 --> 01:47:29.904]  That's the quote and laughing about it.
[01:47:30.184 --> 01:47:33.325]  I mean, some of the troops have been turned into psychopathic killing machines.
[01:47:33.965 --> 01:47:37.766]  Well, you know, that's very sad because they will come home.
[01:47:38.442 --> 01:47:42.084]  And will they continue to be those kinds of killing machines when they come home?
[01:47:42.464 --> 01:47:46.486]  We already had the incident at Fort Bragg with the people coming back.
[01:47:47.767 --> 01:47:53.590]  One unit and four of them come home, three of them kill their wives, and the other one tries to kill his wife in one week.
[01:47:53.910 --> 01:47:54.890]  I mean, what's going on there?
[01:47:55.311 --> 01:47:56.491]  That's exactly right.
[01:47:56.551 --> 01:48:01.854]  So we also have to be careful about one of the questions I ask,
[01:48:02.541 --> 01:48:07.225]  Any young man or woman that I see in uniform, I ask them, did you take those shots?
[01:48:07.285 --> 01:48:09.107]  Because we don't know what those shots are.
[01:48:09.487 --> 01:48:11.449]  We don't know what they're doing to our young people.
[01:48:11.469 --> 01:48:15.152]  Well, we know the first anthrax shot, they got shot down because it was full of poison.
[01:48:15.172 --> 01:48:15.713]  That's admitted.
[01:48:17.435 --> 01:48:21.058]  Well, then all the more that they not take these shots.
[01:48:21.118 --> 01:48:21.798]  We don't know.
[01:48:22.679 --> 01:48:26.603]  We have no idea what these young people...
[01:48:27.623 --> 01:48:30.925]  What their lives are going to be like five years, ten years from now.
[01:48:31.085 --> 01:48:32.026]  Yeah, that's not normal.
[01:48:32.106 --> 01:48:36.069]  Why would one unit, would four of them come back and kill their families?
[01:48:36.329 --> 01:48:40.132]  Well, we don't know, but we certainly need to know.
[01:48:40.152 --> 01:48:42.713]  We certainly need to know so we can not do that.
[01:48:43.814 --> 01:48:56.705]  Speaking of that, Wired Magazine two years ago had a big article about the head futurist of the Pentagon, Dr. Marshall, and he said we're selectively giving the troops aggression drugs and then giving them amnesics afterwards.
[01:48:56.745 --> 01:48:59.107]  So he admitted they're mind-controlling some of the troops.
[01:48:59.828 --> 01:49:02.510]  Well, that goes back to MKUltra.
[01:49:02.871 --> 01:49:04.152]  Now, the third instance...
[01:49:04.747 --> 01:49:22.052]  That this administration has amply demonstrated, not just to the American people, but to the world, that it is not able to or it doesn't care about protecting the American people, and that's in the instance of Hurricane Katrina.
[01:49:22.532 --> 01:49:24.353]  And I've been very active...
[01:49:26.186 --> 01:49:35.770]  On this Katrina panel so that we can get to the root of what happened and we all saw what didn't happen, but why it didn't happen.
[01:49:35.950 --> 01:49:36.731]  We've got a break.
[01:49:36.811 --> 01:49:37.971]  One more segment coming up.
[01:49:38.011 --> 01:49:39.592]  Tell us all about Katrina when we get back.
[01:49:39.632 --> 01:49:46.854]  I also want to ask you about the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King and your research into that because we have someone joining us tomorrow in studio who you know.
[01:49:47.215 --> 01:49:50.676]  Dr. King's murder will be exposed.
[01:49:50.696 --> 01:49:51.316]  We'll be right back.
[01:49:51.356 --> 01:49:51.736]  Stay with us.
[01:49:55.091 --> 01:49:57.933]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[01:49:58.194 --> 01:49:58.914]  Hello, my friends.
[01:49:58.994 --> 01:49:59.795]  Alex Jones here.
[01:50:00.135 --> 01:50:04.799]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law, 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[01:50:05.139 --> 01:50:11.885]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[01:50:12.205 --> 01:50:14.187]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[01:50:14.387 --> 01:50:17.229]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[01:50:17.329 --> 01:50:21.993]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[01:50:22.193 --> 01:50:26.576]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight, piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[01:50:26.837 --> 01:50:34.062]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[01:50:34.323 --> 01:50:36.764]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.
[01:50:36.905 --> 01:50:38.626]  Call toll-free to get a copy of Martial Law.

[01:50:54.170 --> 01:51:00.393]  The illuminated Berkey base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[01:51:00.553 --> 01:51:06.716]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[01:51:06.996 --> 01:51:15.420]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[01:51:15.681 --> 01:51:22.684]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter, and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[01:51:23.004 --> 01:51:27.827]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[01:51:28.027 --> 01:51:33.431]  The Berkey base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[01:51:33.791 --> 01:51:36.853]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[01:51:37.194 --> 01:51:45.199]  Get the illuminated Berkey base for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:51:45.219 --> 01:51:45.779]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[01:51:55.425 --> 01:52:01.366]  Herbal Healer Academy is a global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.
[01:52:01.606 --> 01:52:03.847]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.
[01:52:04.047 --> 01:52:10.389]  We provide outstanding products like Esiac, colloidal silver 500 parts per million, olive leaf extract,
[01:52:10.789 --> 01:52:11.169]  Thank you.
[01:52:31.158 --> 01:52:31.599]  We're good to go.
[01:52:55.108 --> 01:53:14.834]  I was talking to the Congresswoman during the break, she's going to stay with us a little bit in the next hour, very gracious, about how when I started talking about DynCorp, I was told through two different sources to shut up about it, and I asked her, have you ever been told to shut up?
[01:53:14.874 --> 01:53:19.815]  And she laughed and said, yeah, you've got to ask me that on air, so I'll ask that right now, then we'll get into New Orleans.
[01:53:19.855 --> 01:53:20.375]  Congresswoman?
[01:53:21.138 --> 01:53:29.640]  Well, let me just say, I couldn't withhold the laughter because I've been told to be quiet so many times in so many different ways.
[01:53:30.220 --> 01:53:35.981]  But, you know, when you're made of this kind of stuff, you're not intimidated.
[01:53:36.381 --> 01:53:48.204]  But I have an outstanding warrant right now against a gentleman who called all over America, but interestingly had access to
[01:53:49.193 --> 01:53:51.974]  My telephone records at my campaign.
[01:53:52.754 --> 01:54:02.597]  And now he had access to my telephone records and was able to call people that we called in the campaign and tell them that my life was in danger.
[01:54:02.617 --> 01:54:07.118]  So this was quite a warning.
[01:54:07.898 --> 01:54:17.041]  And now it continues with irregular visits to people who are friends of mine, to their homes.
[01:54:17.677 --> 01:54:22.119]  So, you know, all I have to do is take this in stride.
[01:54:22.619 --> 01:54:29.462]  My telephone, everybody, my mother's phone, we just live with this.
[01:54:29.922 --> 01:54:34.124]  And my father was in the Civil Rights Movement, so we're accustomed to it.
[01:54:34.184 --> 01:54:44.789]  Well, I was about to say, Bush says, oh, don't worry, it's not for you, but there's articles where the military and the CIA are watching bike riding groups and, you know, innocuous peace groups, innocuous conservative groups.
[01:54:45.389 --> 01:54:53.696]  Here in Georgia, our very small, innocuous Georgia peace group was spied on.
[01:54:54.456 --> 01:54:55.217]  It's amazing.
[01:54:55.297 --> 01:54:58.439]  So, no, they will tell us anything.
[01:54:58.799 --> 01:55:06.185]  Our responsibility is to not believe them and to do what Ronald Reagan told us to do, verify.
[01:55:06.285 --> 01:55:07.766]  That's right, trust but verify.
[01:55:07.986 --> 01:55:12.530]  And I want to talk about Katrina when we get back in this last segment, but right now, Dr. Martin Luther King...
[01:55:13.130 --> 01:55:14.170]  Clearly murdered.
[01:55:14.270 --> 01:55:15.551]  The evidence shows it.
[01:55:15.611 --> 01:55:16.671]  Clearly a government op.
[01:55:17.251 --> 01:55:19.332]  And now so many witnesses have come forward.
[01:55:19.352 --> 01:55:24.213]  I've interviewed a Special Forces colonel who's won this case in court when they were saying stuff he was saying wasn't true.
[01:55:24.293 --> 01:55:25.193]  That was just last week.
[01:55:27.294 --> 01:55:32.475]  That was Colonel Marvin, where they even tried to hire him to get involved in all of this.
[01:55:32.515 --> 01:55:35.076]  Can you comment on the murder of Dr. Martin Luther King?
[01:55:36.175 --> 01:55:47.899]  We have introduced the Martin Luther King Records Act, which will establish in very much the same way that there was a record that established to release the papers of President Kennedy.
[01:55:48.299 --> 01:55:50.940]  We want all of the papers, everything,
[01:55:52.401 --> 01:55:57.825]  Release pertaining to the life, surveillance, and murder of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
[01:55:57.885 --> 01:55:58.306]  as well.
[01:55:58.766 --> 01:56:01.708]  So we've got 53 co-sponsors on that bill.
[01:56:01.748 --> 01:56:08.373]  We're going to go continue to accumulate co-sponsors, to actively go after co-sponsors.
[01:56:09.054 --> 01:56:17.421]  And we want release of the information because, of course, on April 4th, I was at the Lorraine Motel.
[01:56:18.341 --> 01:56:34.951]  And it's interesting that having been there and knowing what I know, that when they have the picture, not the picture, but the actual rifle, and they label it as the murder weapon, well, Judge Joe Brown told us it is not the murder weapon.
[01:56:35.311 --> 01:56:46.466]  So why is this lie being perpetrated on the American people who go to this Lorraine Motel to visit and think that they're seeing the truth about what happened with Dr. King?
[01:56:46.626 --> 01:56:48.068]  Now why is this important?
[01:56:48.288 --> 01:56:50.892]  Bottom line, who killed Martin Luther King?
[01:56:52.245 --> 01:56:55.766]  Well, a jury said in 1999 that it was a U.S.
[01:56:55.826 --> 01:57:06.570]  government conspiracy, including the highest individuals, certain individuals, and the highest levels of the United States government.
[01:57:06.590 --> 01:57:08.411]  I have no reason to disbelieve them.
[01:57:08.991 --> 01:57:11.052]  And why was the previous statement important?
[01:57:11.092 --> 01:57:11.572]  I interrupted.
[01:57:12.691 --> 01:57:29.298]  Well, the reason this is important, because if they would do that then to Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., at a stage where we have legislation in law now that defines enemy combatants, we all could be enemy combatants just by dissenting from what this administration does.
[01:57:29.318 --> 01:57:29.778]  I agree.
[01:57:29.798 --> 01:57:30.178]  We've got to break.
[01:57:30.198 --> 01:57:31.359]  And they do the same thing to us.
[01:57:31.739 --> 01:57:32.179]  Exactly.
[01:57:32.199 --> 01:57:37.901]  If you would like a copy of this show, come to GCNlive.com and reserve it today.
[01:57:38.242 --> 01:57:39.122]  Or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[01:57:50.203 --> 01:57:50.863]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.503 --> 01:57:52.564]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:53.284 --> 01:57:54.405]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:55.045 --> 01:57:55.866]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.606 --> 01:57:57.486]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.506 --> 01:58:01.848]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.349 --> 01:58:06.491]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:06.691 --> 01:58:17.616]  If you go online to Infowars.com, you can link through to Congresswoman Cynthia McKinney's subpage at house.gov.
[01:58:18.414 --> 01:58:20.115]  Gov, be sure and support her.
[01:58:20.135 --> 01:58:27.861]  She has been targeted by the RNC and even the Democrats to some extent, just like Ron Paul has by his own party with the Republicans.
[01:58:28.222 --> 01:58:33.445]  Anybody who stands up for the people, and she's just an amazing individual, and we're almost out of time with her.
[01:58:33.505 --> 01:58:34.026]  Congresswoman?
[01:58:34.881 --> 01:58:35.662]  Alex Jones Show!
[01:58:35.682 --> 01:58:37.204]  We're good to go.
[01:58:37.224 --> 01:58:37.384]  I think?
[01:58:51.339 --> 01:58:52.320]  Well, I could only hear...
[01:59:18.368 --> 01:59:19.409]  Then it was really bad.
[01:59:19.449 --> 01:59:20.329]  You went out on me.
[01:59:20.369 --> 01:59:22.070]  But I get the gist of what you're saying.
[01:59:22.650 --> 01:59:25.651]  And the bottom line is that you're absolutely right.
[01:59:26.032 --> 01:59:28.533]  The American people were once again abandoned.
[01:59:28.813 --> 01:59:30.694]  They were abandoned by their own government.
[01:59:31.034 --> 01:59:34.956]  And Secretary Michael Chertoff has gotten off scot-free on this.
[01:59:35.436 --> 01:59:38.537]  But he has the authority, had the authority...
[01:59:40.274 --> 01:59:51.730]  As soon as the state of emergency was declared, he had the authority to move all of the supplies and everything that was needed by the people into place.
[01:59:51.790 --> 01:59:54.713]  Instead, just as one of the survivors said,
[01:59:55.294 --> 01:59:59.876]  They needed food and water, and instead, they were sent men with guns.
[02:00:00.396 --> 02:00:06.178]  And the Blackwater mercenaries were hired to patrol the streets of New Orleans.
[02:00:06.478 --> 02:00:08.799]  This is criminal!
[02:00:09.220 --> 02:00:12.801]  How can we have mercenaries patrolling the streets of America?
[02:00:13.041 --> 02:00:14.922]  Well, what about all the gun confiscation?
[02:00:14.962 --> 02:00:23.506]  Instead of letting the local police and firemen to give people food and water, for five days they ran around confiscating people's guns.
[02:00:23.566 --> 02:00:25.087]  It was totally insane.
[02:00:25.147 --> 02:00:29.769]  And my point is that they clearly stood down on purpose and blocked...
[02:00:30.249 --> 02:00:31.010]  You know, I really...
[02:00:49.485 --> 02:00:52.246]  I don't know the answer to that question, but it's clear.
[02:00:52.266 --> 02:00:57.969]  It is absolutely clear that you had Bush on vacation.
[02:00:58.229 --> 02:00:59.830]  You had Cheney fly fishing.
[02:01:00.070 --> 02:01:03.052]  You had Rumsfeld at a San Diego Padres game.
[02:01:03.412 --> 02:01:12.657]  You had Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice buying $7,000 worth of Ferragamo shoes and hitting the tennis ball with Monica Sellis.
[02:01:13.077 --> 02:01:16.398]  I mean, you had an administration that was away.
[02:01:16.438 --> 02:01:17.359]  They were AWOL.
[02:01:17.859 --> 02:01:32.187]  And they have the nerve to bring other folks up on criminal charges for either being conscientious objector or one family made the wrong bet and about 20 people in their care died.
[02:01:32.247 --> 02:01:34.128]  They're being brought up on charges.
[02:01:35.208 --> 02:01:36.669]  But Congresswoman, here's what I'm saying.
[02:01:36.709 --> 02:01:40.771]  We know that FEMA blocked the police from getting in for at least five days.
[02:01:41.011 --> 02:01:42.492]  That's got to be premeditated.
[02:01:42.892 --> 02:01:43.153]  Yes.
[02:01:43.453 --> 02:01:44.713]  Well, you know, I...
[02:01:47.399 --> 02:01:49.702]  I don't want to say that yet.
[02:01:50.142 --> 02:01:54.607]  I do want to say that their actions, their behavior speaks for itself.
[02:01:55.108 --> 02:02:05.761]  And the fact that you had a local sheriff had to go with his armed people and turn the power, turn the communication back on.
[02:02:06.481 --> 02:02:13.045]  Well, if it looks like a duck, walks like a duck, quacks like a duck, it's a duck.
[02:02:13.285 --> 02:02:16.426]  Congresswoman, I want to be able to get you on a few times a year.
[02:02:16.446 --> 02:02:17.207]  Will you join us again?
[02:02:17.787 --> 02:02:18.047]  I'd love to.
[02:02:27.692 --> 02:02:33.200]  Well, I want to thank you and your staff so much, and I want to thank you for standing up for all the children that the government and others have been kidnapping.
[02:02:33.521 --> 02:02:35.844]  And God bless you, and I hope everybody prays for you.
[02:02:36.064 --> 02:02:36.485]  Thank you.
[02:02:36.525 --> 02:02:37.426]  I need those prayers.
[02:02:38.027 --> 02:02:39.489]  Well, thank you, and we'll talk to you soon.
[02:02:39.509 --> 02:02:40.070]  Bye-bye.
[02:02:40.410 --> 02:02:40.951]  Godspeed.
[02:02:40.991 --> 02:02:43.254]  All right, we'll come back, take your calls, cover masses of news.
[02:02:43.555 --> 02:02:44.396]  That was a great interview.
[02:02:45.896 --> 02:02:52.740]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[02:02:53.040 --> 02:02:54.441]  That's right folks, DVD.
[02:02:54.621 --> 02:02:56.822]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[02:02:56.982 --> 02:02:59.064]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[02:02:59.344 --> 02:03:04.286]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[02:03:04.607 --> 02:03:08.629]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[02:03:08.889 --> 02:03:10.670]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[02:03:10.730 --> 02:03:21.394]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plannable microchips, and much, much more.
[02:03:21.534 --> 02:03:23.434]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[02:03:23.634 --> 02:03:27.496]  Order your copy on VHS or DVD today and man the guns of the Infowar.
[02:03:27.596 --> 02:03:29.016]  Order right now by calling 1-888-2533-139.
[02:03:29.076 --> 02:03:29.257]  That's 888-2533-139.
[02:03:35.979 --> 02:03:39.668]  Or order online at Infowars.com or Infowars.net.
[02:03:39.948 --> 02:03:40.670]  Again, that number, 888-253-3139.
[02:03:45.157 --> 02:03:50.459]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones introducing you to the incredible Berkey Solar Charger.
[02:03:50.659 --> 02:03:52.720]  Your source for free solar electricity.
[02:03:52.980 --> 02:04:00.082]  This portable system is the size of a book when folded and small enough to fit into a briefcase, handbag, or glove compartment.
[02:04:00.222 --> 02:04:11.726]  The Berkey Solar Charger has been designed to power the Berkey lights, LED lamps, as well as other applications such as mobile phones, radios, digital cameras, and PDAs when electricity is unavailable.
[02:04:12.066 --> 02:04:12.867]  We're good to go.
[02:04:47.091 --> 02:04:51.535]  If you think your engine is safe by having the oil changed every 3,000 miles, think again.
[02:04:51.815 --> 02:04:55.398]  Every time you start your car, your engine creates friction between the moving parts.
[02:04:55.538 --> 02:05:03.646]  These moving parts wear against each other, and the result is small metal particles circulating through your oil, causing premature wear and damage to your engine.
[02:05:03.906 --> 02:05:09.549]  Oil filters do a good job of trapping the large metal particles, but they will not trap the most harmful tiny particles.
[02:05:09.849 --> 02:05:15.092]  These tiny particles circulate constantly through your oil, and over time your engine begins to show signs of wear.
[02:05:15.352 --> 02:05:17.433]  This is why you need the filter mag.
[02:05:17.693 --> 02:05:29.860]  The filter mag is a powerful magnet that holds itself to the outside of your oil filter, trapping the tiny metal particles to the inside wall of the filter, extending the life of your oil and ultimately extending the life of your engine.
[02:05:30.080 --> 02:05:34.505]  The reusable FilterMag is maintenance-free, installed in two seconds, and lasts forever.
[02:05:34.725 --> 02:05:35.666]  So what are you waiting for?
[02:05:35.866 --> 02:05:37.488]  Go to FilterMag.com.
[02:05:37.608 --> 02:05:39.410]  That's FilterMag.com.
[02:05:39.650 --> 02:05:40.131]  Or call 800-345-8376.
[02:05:40.171 --> 02:05:40.351]  That's 800-345-8376.
[02:05:40.391 --> 02:05:41.592]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:05:41.612 --> 02:05:42.894]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:01.291 --> 02:06:05.693]  Well, we had Congresswoman Cynthia McKinney on with us in the last hour.
[02:06:07.334 --> 02:06:13.597]  And, again, I'm more conservative on the Second Amendment issues and border issues and things like that, but I've heard her defend the Second Amendment now in the past.
[02:06:13.637 --> 02:06:14.397]  She was a gun grabber.
[02:06:15.197 --> 02:06:17.258]  She's really had an awakening in the last few years.
[02:06:17.278 --> 02:06:20.560]  And, of course, she said that clearly the government could have been involved.
[02:06:20.580 --> 02:06:22.101]  9-11 somehow was covering it up.
[02:06:22.521 --> 02:06:26.003]  And they really went after her, and then they engineered her being defeated.
[02:06:26.881 --> 02:06:29.743]  By having Republicans go run as Democrats to remove her.
[02:06:29.763 --> 02:06:32.945]  And then she came back and beat him in the next election two years later.
[02:06:32.965 --> 02:06:34.847]  And it was just an amazing interview.
[02:06:34.887 --> 02:06:44.093]  And since we brought up the stand-down of FEMA in blocking police aid and then blaming it on the locals, let's go ahead and roll that clip of the emergency manager.
[02:06:45.314 --> 02:06:48.776]  Well, this is actually the city manager there, the equivalent of the mayor.
[02:06:49.753 --> 02:06:56.038]  Talking about his emergency manager in New Orleans not being allowed to go in and even save his mother for several days.
[02:06:56.298 --> 02:06:57.739]  So let's go ahead and roll that clip.
[02:06:58.360 --> 02:07:00.622]  President Broussard, let me start with you.
[02:07:01.162 --> 02:07:05.545]  You just heard the Director of Homeland Security's explanation of what has happened this last week.
[02:07:05.906 --> 02:07:06.706]  What is your reaction?
[02:07:09.388 --> 02:07:11.770]  We have been abandoned by our own country.
[02:07:12.431 --> 02:07:17.775]  Hurricane Katrina will go down in history as one of the worst storms ever to hit an American coast.
[02:07:18.322 --> 02:07:27.425]  But the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina will go down as one of the worst abandonments of Americans on American soil ever in U.S.
[02:07:27.445 --> 02:07:27.825]  history.
[02:07:28.685 --> 02:07:37.068]  I am personally asking our bipartisan congressional delegation here in Louisiana to immediately begin congressional hearings
[02:07:37.543 --> 02:07:39.944]  To find out just what happened here.
[02:07:40.424 --> 02:07:41.404]  Why did it happen?
[02:07:41.804 --> 02:07:43.105]  Who needs to be fired?
[02:07:43.165 --> 02:07:48.027]  And believe me, they need to be fired right away because we still have weeks to go in this tragedy.
[02:07:48.067 --> 02:07:49.067]  We have months to go.
[02:07:49.127 --> 02:07:50.187]  We have years to go.
[02:07:50.768 --> 02:07:57.830]  And whoever's at the top of this totem pole, that totem pole needs to be chainsawed off and we've got to start with some new leadership.
[02:07:58.770 --> 02:08:03.552]  It's not just Katrina that caused all these deaths in New Orleans here.
[02:08:05.169 --> 02:08:13.563]  Bureaucracy has committed murder here in the Greater New Orleans area and bureaucracy has to stand trial before Congress now.
[02:08:14.264 --> 02:08:15.025]  It's so obvious.
[02:08:15.569 --> 02:08:17.530]  FEMA needs more congressional funding.
[02:08:17.670 --> 02:08:19.811]  It needs more presidential support.
[02:08:20.432 --> 02:08:23.573]  It needs to be a cabinet-level director.
[02:08:24.074 --> 02:08:33.339]  It needs to be an independent agency that will be able to fulfill its mission to work in partnership with state and local governments around America.
[02:08:33.799 --> 02:08:37.581]  FEMA needs to be empowered to do the things that was created to do.
[02:08:38.274 --> 02:08:44.697]  It needs to come somewhere like New Orleans with all of its force immediately without red tape, without bureaucracy.
[02:08:45.157 --> 02:08:49.838]  Act immediately with common sense and leadership and save lives.
[02:08:49.898 --> 02:08:50.999]  Forget about the property.
[02:08:51.039 --> 02:08:52.319]  We can rebuild the property.
[02:08:52.660 --> 02:08:54.840]  It's got to be able to come in and save lives.
[02:08:55.561 --> 02:09:01.683]  We need strong leadership at the top of America right now in order to accomplish this
[02:09:02.390 --> 02:09:04.252]  Into reconstructing FEMA.
[02:09:04.912 --> 02:09:06.914]  Mr. Broussard, let me ask you one question.
[02:09:06.974 --> 02:09:07.234]  Hold on.
[02:09:07.394 --> 02:09:07.814]  Hold on, sir.
[02:09:08.214 --> 02:09:14.199]  Shouldn't the mayor of New Orleans and the governor of New Orleans bear some responsibility?
[02:09:14.559 --> 02:09:20.884]  Couldn't they have been much more forceful, much more effective, and much more organized in evacuating the area?
[02:09:22.944 --> 02:09:29.530]  Sir, they were told, like me, every single day, the Calvary's coming on a federal level.
[02:09:29.810 --> 02:09:30.831]  The Calvary's coming.
[02:09:31.091 --> 02:09:32.112]  The Calvary's coming.
[02:09:32.392 --> 02:09:33.413]  The Calvary's coming.
[02:09:33.994 --> 02:09:37.637]  I have just begun to hear the hoofs of the Calvary.
[02:09:37.877 --> 02:09:43.382]  The Calvary's still not here yet, but I've begun to hear the hoofs and we're almost a week out.
[02:09:43.422 --> 02:09:45.204]  Let me give you just three quick examples.
[02:09:45.604 --> 02:09:49.926]  We had Walmart deliver three trucks of water, trailer trucks of water.
[02:09:50.026 --> 02:09:51.206]  FEMA turned them back.
[02:09:51.546 --> 02:09:52.666]  They said we didn't need them.
[02:09:52.947 --> 02:09:53.967]  This was a week ago.
[02:09:54.847 --> 02:10:01.569]  FEMA, we had a thousand gallons of diesel fuel on a Coast Guard vessel docked in my parish.
[02:10:01.770 --> 02:10:04.070]  The Coast Guard said, come get the fuel right away.
[02:10:04.350 --> 02:10:06.571]  When we got there with our trucks, they got a word.
[02:10:06.711 --> 02:10:08.452]  FEMA says, don't give you the fuel.
[02:10:08.812 --> 02:10:11.913]  Yesterday, yesterday, FEMA comes in and cuts
[02:10:12.333 --> 02:10:16.115]  All of our emergency communication lines, they cut them without notice.
[02:10:16.776 --> 02:10:24.340]  Our Sheriff, Harry Lee, goes back in, he reconnects the line, he posts armed guards on our line and says, no one's getting near these lines.
[02:10:24.640 --> 02:10:27.522]  Sheriff Harry Lee said that if America
[02:10:27.922 --> 02:10:32.985]  If the American government would have responded like Walmart has responded, we wouldn't be in this crisis.
[02:10:33.065 --> 02:10:37.167]  But I want to thank Governor Blanco for all she's done and all her leadership.
[02:10:37.207 --> 02:10:38.568]  She's sent in the National Guard.
[02:10:38.928 --> 02:10:45.172]  I just repaired a breach on my side of the 17th Street Canal that the Secretary didn't foresee.
[02:10:45.252 --> 02:10:45.953]  A 300-foot breach.
[02:10:46.293 --> 02:10:52.656]  I just completed it yesterday with convoys of National Guard and local parish workers and levy board people.
[02:10:52.957 --> 02:10:54.778]  It took us two and a half days working 24-7.
[02:10:54.798 --> 02:10:55.278]  I just closed it.
[02:10:57.419 --> 02:11:04.604]  I'm telling you, most importantly, I want to thank my public employees that have worked 24-7, that burn out, the doctors, the nurses.
[02:11:04.925 --> 02:11:08.607]  And I want to give you one last story, and I'll shut up unless you tell me whatever you want to tell me.
[02:11:09.208 --> 02:11:14.191]  The guy who runs this building I'm in, emergency management, he's responsible for everything.
[02:11:14.671 --> 02:11:16.773]  His mother was trapped in St.
[02:11:16.793 --> 02:11:22.097]  Bernard Nursing Home, and every day she called him and said, Are you coming, son?
[02:11:22.437 --> 02:11:23.478]  Is somebody coming?
[02:11:23.958 --> 02:11:25.079]  And he said, Yeah, Mama.
[02:11:25.459 --> 02:11:26.979]  Somebody's coming to get you.
[02:11:27.540 --> 02:11:29.720]  Somebody's coming to get you on Tuesday.
[02:11:30.020 --> 02:11:31.781]  Somebody's coming to get you on Wednesday.
[02:11:32.421 --> 02:11:34.321]  Somebody's coming to get you on Thursday.
[02:11:34.881 --> 02:11:36.862]  Somebody's coming to get you on Friday.
[02:11:37.282 --> 02:11:38.282]  And she drowned it.
[02:11:38.722 --> 02:11:39.542]  Friday night.
[02:11:40.183 --> 02:11:41.023]  She drowned it.
[02:11:41.123 --> 02:11:43.583]  Friday night.
[02:11:44.284 --> 02:11:45.844]  Nobody's coming to get her.
[02:11:46.597 --> 02:11:48.819]  Nobody's coming together.
[02:11:48.839 --> 02:11:50.261]  The Secretary has promised.
[02:11:50.441 --> 02:11:51.602]  Everybody's promised.
[02:11:52.062 --> 02:11:54.124]  They've had press conferences.
[02:11:54.324 --> 02:11:56.006]  I'm sick of the press conferences.
[02:11:56.506 --> 02:11:59.709]  For God's sakes, shut up and send us somebody.
[02:12:00.169 --> 02:12:00.570]  All right.
[02:12:00.970 --> 02:12:02.171]  Now let's stop.
[02:12:02.271 --> 02:12:03.072]  Let's stop right there.
[02:12:03.112 --> 02:12:04.113]  Now let's go over that clip.
[02:12:04.213 --> 02:12:07.215]  If you can watch the video, and it's on presentplanet.com.
[02:12:08.577 --> 02:12:09.738]  And this is four days into it.
[02:12:10.839 --> 02:12:12.220]  It's on presentplanet.com.
[02:12:12.340 --> 02:12:13.461]  We haven't talked about this in a while.
[02:12:14.893 --> 02:12:17.274]  He's reading off a script, and this is what they were all saying.
[02:12:17.294 --> 02:12:19.115]  They were all given by FEMA a script.
[02:12:19.235 --> 02:12:28.438]  Things are so horrible, FEMA needs more funding and unlimited power, and they already have that, and it's unconstitutional, and in other hurricanes they are there, they do do a good job.
[02:12:28.838 --> 02:12:30.079]  That's only 8% of their funding.
[02:12:30.379 --> 02:12:33.460]  Their real operation is cognitive government and takeover, and that's admitted now.
[02:12:34.685 --> 02:12:45.212]  So see, by screwing up, by blocking the aid, by holding back 50,000 firefighters and over 100,000 cops that tried to get into the area, they wouldn't even let them, by two weeks in.
[02:12:45.692 --> 02:12:58.620]  By blocking, by blocking the citizens and the boats and the people, it was the citizens, it was the local police, the local firefighters, the citizens aiding them, in there working together, the way America's supposed to operate, that blocked up levies, that went in and saved people.
[02:12:58.840 --> 02:12:59.360]  We're good to go.
[02:12:59.380 --> 02:12:59.561]  I think?
[02:13:28.800 --> 02:13:29.660]  We're good to go.
[02:13:57.802 --> 02:13:58.082]  Thank you.
[02:13:58.102 --> 02:13:58.343]  Thank you.
[02:14:21.505 --> 02:14:21.925]  We're good to go.
[02:14:21.945 --> 02:14:22.085]  I think?
[02:14:44.222 --> 02:14:47.605]  Anybody got in my way, they'd be in deep trouble, folks.
[02:14:48.265 --> 02:14:49.826]  And you can read between the lines on that.
[02:14:50.106 --> 02:14:57.732]  I mean, imagine the emergency manager sitting there with all the police under him and letting his mother die because FEMA said so.
[02:14:58.692 --> 02:14:59.793]  And let me tell you something, folks.
[02:14:59.853 --> 02:15:04.096]  You can't count on the cops to help you when the New World Order really pulls a big one, an A-bomb or something.
[02:15:04.357 --> 02:15:10.041]  A lot of cops are good, but still, they'll just sit at home or they'll just follow orders, most of them.
[02:15:10.281 --> 02:15:11.922]  They're so conditioned to do it.
[02:15:12.910 --> 02:15:20.413]  And I'll just ask the police, are you going to sit by during quarantine and let your family die inside a city while you sit there on your squad car knowing your kids are dying?
[02:15:21.533 --> 02:15:22.734]  I mean, are you really going to do that?
[02:15:22.794 --> 02:15:24.474]  I mean, what is your major malfunction?
[02:15:26.635 --> 02:15:27.756]  It's the brainwashing.
[02:15:27.976 --> 02:15:28.996]  I just can't believe it.
[02:15:29.516 --> 02:15:31.037]  Let's go ahead and talk to Evan.
[02:15:31.557 --> 02:15:32.638]  And Evan's in Nebraska.
[02:15:32.658 --> 02:15:33.458]  Thanks for holding, Evan.
[02:15:33.478 --> 02:15:33.878]  Go ahead.
[02:15:33.898 --> 02:15:36.659]  Alex, yeah, it's Nevada, actually.
[02:15:37.219 --> 02:15:38.420]  Well, you know, it's nearby.
[02:15:38.440 --> 02:15:41.201]  Somewhere in the big U.S.
[02:15:42.162 --> 02:15:52.585]  I was just going to say, yeah, that definitely, he definitely got off the script there and belied his own, you know, he's like, let's give FEMA more funding, and then he's like, He's looking down reading it.
[02:15:52.665 --> 02:15:55.766]  He's looking down reading it, and when the guy attacks him, he goes, okay, I'm done, buddy.
[02:15:55.886 --> 02:15:57.926]  I'm done lying for you, and he just starts blowing up.
[02:15:58.587 --> 02:16:05.549]  He's like, oh, by the way, they're cutting off gas, and they're cutting our emergency lines, and just some great stuff.
[02:16:05.669 --> 02:16:10.610]  But I called you because I got a bulletin on MySpace yesterday.
[02:16:11.655 --> 02:16:15.237]  There's an account on MySpace that is set up in your honor.
[02:16:16.477 --> 02:16:17.037]  They set it up.
[02:16:17.077 --> 02:16:20.519]  They've got audio clips of your show.
[02:16:20.739 --> 02:16:25.481]  And I was going to give you the address to it so you could go take a look for yourself.
[02:16:26.522 --> 02:16:29.224]  I thought it was you at first, but, you know, I was like, ah.
[02:16:29.624 --> 02:16:41.453]  Well, there's a lot of good people on the net, and people think it's me, and there's a lot of bad folks on the net where they don't make it clear, and then people think it's me, and it's, I don't want to, I mean, it's great that folks are promoting stuff, and I think I've heard of that before.
[02:16:41.473 --> 02:16:42.614]  There's a lot of websites out there.
[02:16:42.874 --> 02:16:44.515]  Yeah, tell us about the MySpace address.
[02:16:44.855 --> 02:16:51.320]  It's myspace.com forward slash prison planet com, and they did a decent job.
[02:16:51.420 --> 02:16:54.362]  I messaged them and told them that they need to, because they've got a, like,
[02:17:00.782 --> 02:17:05.805]  Well, I'm not complaining about what they're doing.
[02:17:05.845 --> 02:17:09.868]  You just brought up a big issue lately that I've had where people are... It's a free country.
[02:17:09.888 --> 02:17:11.188]  They can put whatever they want on their website.
[02:17:11.208 --> 02:17:12.209]  It sounds like they're great folks.
[02:17:12.269 --> 02:17:12.809]  I commend them.
[02:17:13.250 --> 02:17:16.552]  I was just adding that, yeah, you couldn't really tell if it was me or not.
[02:17:16.992 --> 02:17:19.874]  Well, think about the bad folks on the net posing as myself.
[02:17:20.434 --> 02:17:22.977]  Yeah, you could have some deficit and sigh opportunity.
[02:17:22.997 --> 02:17:23.637]  We've already had it.
[02:17:23.657 --> 02:17:28.041]  We've got people on payroll that we know who just go around saying horrible things in my name.
[02:17:28.061 --> 02:17:28.862]  I'm really sick of it.
[02:17:28.882 --> 02:17:31.184]  But, you know, people are getting wise to it, so it doesn't matter.
[02:17:31.885 --> 02:17:35.208]  The other thing, I've got a really good story for you here that... Yeah, stay there.
[02:17:35.228 --> 02:17:38.491]  I want to hear about it on the other side of this fast break.

[02:20:48.824 --> 02:20:50.305]  Is that my car talking to me?
[02:20:50.445 --> 02:20:50.725]  Yes.
[02:20:51.025 --> 02:20:51.865]  You neglect me.
[02:20:52.045 --> 02:20:54.006]  Change my oil late most of the time.
[02:20:55.846 --> 02:20:56.867]  Use the cheapest gas.
[02:20:57.207 --> 02:20:58.067]  I'm getting sick.

[02:21:57.533 --> 02:21:59.395]  We headed out of the park with that last interview.
[02:22:00.155 --> 02:22:02.457]  Let's go back to Evan in Nevada.

[02:22:04.338 --> 02:22:04.878]  Yes, Alex.
[02:22:04.938 --> 02:22:06.379]  There's this great article.
[02:22:06.539 --> 02:22:09.842]  It was done on a blog at iratescinemaunderground.com.
[02:22:09.862 --> 02:22:12.824]  It's called Police State High School.
[02:22:12.884 --> 02:22:17.847]  He documented how they were doing all the random breathalyzers and stuff, but then after they left the dance,
[02:22:18.773 --> 02:22:20.794]  The real drama occurred after the dance.
[02:22:20.814 --> 02:22:24.697]  We were followed by a Hamilton Township police officer for four or five miles.
[02:22:24.717 --> 02:22:28.659]  My girlfriend was driving but wasn't speeding or doing anything that seemed reckless.
[02:22:28.979 --> 02:22:33.242]  The officer didn't seem interested in stopping us, only following it seemed.
[02:22:33.622 --> 02:22:46.390]  And he continues on and he pulls him over and he announced that he saw the girlfriend touch the center line a couple times and that he saw us darting into the parking lot.
[02:22:46.954 --> 02:22:47.394]  I think so.
[02:23:09.520 --> 02:23:12.881]  Well, a lot of these guys are perverts, and they just harass good-looking women.
[02:23:12.921 --> 02:23:14.102]  She was probably good-looking.
[02:23:14.122 --> 02:23:15.702]  Well, and they took it a step further.
[02:23:15.722 --> 02:23:18.363]  They figured that they had drugs in the car, and he said...
[02:23:40.602 --> 02:23:42.004]  He says, what about the other option?
[02:23:42.044 --> 02:23:44.808]  I thought, where we don't have any drugs.
[02:23:45.188 --> 02:23:49.875]  The new standard has become, if they don't want me to search them, they must have something to hide.
[02:23:49.975 --> 02:23:54.941]  And we always said that if you have nothing to hide, let them search your car, or what about your house?
[02:23:55.021 --> 02:23:55.943]  And now they come up and...
[02:23:56.767 --> 02:23:57.127]  Hello.
[02:23:57.187 --> 02:23:58.048]  Knock, knock, knock.
[02:23:58.128 --> 02:24:00.049]  And it's happening from Louisiana to New York.
[02:24:00.389 --> 02:24:01.630]  I'd like to do a knock and talk.
[02:24:01.710 --> 02:24:02.711]  Mind if I search the house?
[02:24:02.731 --> 02:24:03.572]  Well, why?
[02:24:03.632 --> 02:24:06.434]  Well, we're just doing neighborhood searches just randomly.
[02:24:06.474 --> 02:24:08.555]  Even areas of Dallas are now doing it.
[02:24:08.595 --> 02:24:09.696]  I saw that a few years ago.
[02:24:09.976 --> 02:24:10.856]  Thanks for the call.
[02:24:10.896 --> 02:24:17.801]  Send me a hyperlink to tipsandinfowars.com or maybe over to my instant messenger here on Yahoo, and we'll try to get that up.
[02:24:17.821 --> 02:24:19.342]  A lot of great tips from you guys.
[02:24:19.983 --> 02:24:22.424]  Let's go ahead now and talk to Alex in Mass.
[02:24:22.524 --> 02:24:23.645]  Alex, you're on the air.
[02:24:23.905 --> 02:24:24.466]  Hey, it's Alex.
[02:24:24.506 --> 02:24:26.367]  Sorry to bring this up, but you mentioned people.
[02:24:27.107 --> 02:24:28.568]  Doing bogus material on you.
[02:24:29.068 --> 02:24:33.670]  And this guy, Perry Logan, I was wondering if you guys even know each other, or what's his deal?
[02:24:33.710 --> 02:24:34.870]  He lives here in Austin.
[02:24:35.751 --> 02:24:41.093]  I don't really watch much TV, so I don't see it, but I've seen the TV show before, and it's really almost comical.
[02:24:41.193 --> 02:24:42.293]  I didn't even know he had a TV.
[02:24:42.393 --> 02:24:44.534]  I didn't see he was promoting anything.
[02:24:44.554 --> 02:24:48.896]  I didn't see anything that he was presenting other than calling you a Nazi turd.
[02:24:50.015 --> 02:24:51.118]  Yeah, I understand.
[02:24:51.138 --> 02:24:52.260]  I just don't even understand it.
[02:24:52.621 --> 02:25:00.619]  Yeah, well, see, there are a lot of people who just are weird or they don't like me, and that's fine, it's free speech.
[02:25:01.471 --> 02:25:11.075]  But if I spent all day talking about all of my detractors, I mean, I didn't even spend much time talking about popular mechanics, you know, that had a cover story attacking myself and a few others.
[02:25:11.535 --> 02:25:13.656]  I didn't spend much time on that.
[02:25:13.736 --> 02:25:20.439]  I never even read on air the Vanity Fair cover story where I was the main person being attacked in Vanity Fair.
[02:25:21.059 --> 02:25:33.785]  I read a few quotes out of the big American Legion magazine when it attacked me, or the Washington Post when it attacked me, or the New York Times when it attacked me, so I'm sure not going to spend time with all these weirdos running around on the web attacking me.
[02:25:34.066 --> 02:25:35.726]  And that guy really isn't a problem.
[02:25:36.007 --> 02:25:40.169]  He does take quotes out of context or change them and do a few of those, but it's mainly kind of a satirical joke.
[02:25:40.889 --> 02:25:43.210]  Almost, you know, it's harmless from what I've seen.
[02:25:43.690 --> 02:25:48.773]  Now, the real problem is other individuals, and I appreciate your call, and
[02:25:49.503 --> 02:25:50.644]  Here's an example.
[02:25:50.684 --> 02:25:56.046]  There are shows that I've never even heard, who I've never even heard before.
[02:25:56.126 --> 02:26:01.248]  And then I'm sitting on an audio clip, and I'm sitting up late at night last night and doing some research.
[02:26:01.308 --> 02:26:02.329]  I go, oh, I'll listen to this.
[02:26:02.369 --> 02:26:07.731]  So I hit a clip, and it's just all lies, all fabrications.
[02:26:07.751 --> 02:26:10.152]  You know, Alex Jones is a pure evil liar.
[02:26:10.592 --> 02:26:11.813]  He says the Vatican...
[02:26:12.814 --> 02:26:13.795]  Runs everything.
[02:26:14.135 --> 02:26:16.197]  Well, I'd say actually the complete opposite.
[02:26:16.778 --> 02:26:17.398]  Never said that.
[02:26:17.438 --> 02:26:22.143]  And then Alex listens to this show every day and is countering us.
[02:26:22.723 --> 02:26:24.045]  Never listened until last night.
[02:26:24.505 --> 02:26:25.946]  And listened to about 20 minutes of it.
[02:26:26.987 --> 02:26:28.008]  And was actually laughing.
[02:26:28.028 --> 02:26:32.312]  But at the same time, people hear that stuff and they just don't know if it's true or not.
[02:26:32.532 --> 02:26:37.017]  But again, the broadcast, the reason we have listeners and others don't, is because we're here every day for 12 years.
[02:26:37.817 --> 02:26:38.657]  We do research.
[02:26:38.737 --> 02:26:39.578]  We have guests on.
[02:26:39.618 --> 02:26:40.798]  We fight the New World Order.
[02:26:40.838 --> 02:26:42.019]  We try to get people involved.
[02:26:42.239 --> 02:26:43.779]  We say we don't have all the answers.
[02:26:43.819 --> 02:26:46.561]  You should go out and do your own research and come to your own conclusions.
[02:26:47.761 --> 02:26:49.642]  We work hard.
[02:26:49.942 --> 02:27:01.666]  A lot of it isn't... A lot of it... What blew me away was is that one of the people attacking me was someone who I just had on this show a few weeks ago.
[02:27:01.927 --> 02:27:05.008]  When I was out of town, I told my guest host, Hey, get this guy on.
[02:27:05.028 --> 02:27:05.528]  He's a good guy.
[02:27:06.528 --> 02:27:08.729]  Somebody even sell their stuff.
[02:27:08.749 --> 02:27:09.630]  I mean, I'm nice.
[02:27:10.790 --> 02:27:11.671]  And I'm being attacked.
[02:27:11.691 --> 02:27:16.794]  I mean, it hurts at a certain level, but at another, I don't even think it's Cohen-Felper.
[02:27:16.814 --> 02:27:20.116]  I think it's just people are insanely jealous of what?
[02:27:20.156 --> 02:27:20.676]  I don't know.
[02:27:20.896 --> 02:27:22.457]  The black circles around my eyes?
[02:27:23.818 --> 02:27:28.300]  The pain, the nightmares of living my life, fighting this 18 hours a day?
[02:27:28.320 --> 02:27:29.361]  I don't understand.
[02:27:29.381 --> 02:27:30.942]  I just don't understand.
[02:27:30.982 --> 02:27:33.403]  You know, that hurts when it's somebody who did nothing but help.
[02:27:33.984 --> 02:27:34.504]  It hurts.
[02:27:36.292 --> 02:27:37.273]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.674 --> 02:27:39.336]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.356 --> 02:27:43.020]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:47.325 --> 02:27:55.255]  For thousands of years, the secret of vitality, strength, virility, and endurance was kept by the ancient Incas until now.
[02:27:55.974 --> 02:28:10.564]  Maca, a tuberous plant that only grows in one area of the Andes Mountains, is a functional food and it contains no cholesterol, is rich in vitamins, minerals, fiber, protein, five natural sterols, and seven of the nine essential amino acids.
[02:28:11.205 --> 02:28:17.469]  The folks at Vitamir have now made Maca available in powder form so that you can experience its nutritional benefits.
[02:28:18.130 --> 02:28:19.411]  Call 877-817-9829 to order Maca today.
[02:28:23.326 --> 02:28:28.790]  Maca also contains tannins, flavonoids, alkaloids, and fatty acids not found in other foods.
[02:28:29.390 --> 02:28:32.492]  Try Maca and you'll know the secret of the ancient Incas.
[02:28:32.912 --> 02:28:33.173]  Call 877-817-9829.
[02:28:33.213 --> 02:28:34.594]  That's 877-817-9829 and order your Maca today.
[02:28:34.634 --> 02:28:34.954]  Maca.
[02:28:35.194 --> 02:28:36.935]  Now you'll know the secret.
[02:28:45.467 --> 02:28:52.996]  Get the new Berkey battery adapter, an inexpensive yet long-term backup power supply for your Berkey Light LED system.
[02:28:53.276 --> 02:29:06.231]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because, incredibly, they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark, yet require very little energy.
[02:29:06.531 --> 02:29:09.834]  That's why this revolutionary new technology is a bit expensive.
[02:29:10.174 --> 02:29:20.644]  But it's worth every penny, because the low-energy LEDs are able to provide light all night long for over two weeks on a single set of four AA alkaline batteries.
[02:29:20.944 --> 02:29:21.424]  That's right.
[02:29:21.625 --> 02:29:28.731]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[02:29:29.011 --> 02:29:37.761]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey battery adapter, complete with on-off switch for only $10 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:29:37.781 --> 02:29:38.261]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[02:29:45.869 --> 02:29:48.049]  Ever wish your kid came with an instruction manual?
[02:29:48.330 --> 02:30:01.012]  I'm behavioral therapist James Lehman, and I'll show you how to change your child's behavior now with the Total Transformation, the program that helps stop defiance, backtalking, lying, acting out in school, even problems with ADD and ADHD.
[02:30:01.272 --> 02:30:03.593]  There's no screaming, no fighting, no frustration.
[02:30:03.793 --> 02:30:05.153]  Your child will listen to you again.
[02:30:05.393 --> 02:30:06.013]  I guarantee it.
[02:30:06.253 --> 02:30:09.134]  Change your child's behavior now with the Total Transformation.
[02:30:09.354 --> 02:30:09.934]  Call now, 1-800.
[02:30:11.054 --> 02:30:22.943]  When my son started having behavior problems, the total transformation techniques were like the instruction manual on how to deal with him.
[02:30:23.183 --> 02:30:24.484]  We got immediate results.
[02:30:24.985 --> 02:30:27.086]  Do you need an instruction manual for your kid?
[02:30:27.547 --> 02:30:35.833]  I'm behavioral therapist James Lehman, and I'll show you how to change your child's behavior now with the total transformation, the program that helps stop defiance and backtalking.
[02:30:36.073 --> 02:30:37.394]  Your child will listen to you again.
[02:30:40.202 --> 02:30:43.343]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:30:43.363 --> 02:30:44.844]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:31:12.291 --> 02:31:14.473]  I'm in love with the truth.
[02:31:15.073 --> 02:31:21.696]  I'm in love with liberty and freedom and beauty and decency and creativity.
[02:31:22.577 --> 02:31:31.662]  I've always tried to challenge the listeners not to get caught up in little side issues.
[02:31:33.500 --> 02:31:36.661]  And to stay focused on the New World Order.
[02:31:36.721 --> 02:31:45.162]  I mean, when Michael Chertoff, Homeland Security Director's nephew, wrote a huge hit piece on me, I spent about an hour on the show about it, which was way too much.
[02:31:45.702 --> 02:31:51.183]  And then for about two weeks, longer than that, I had maybe one in five callers, one in three callers.
[02:31:51.703 --> 02:31:52.343]  I didn't do the math.
[02:31:52.423 --> 02:31:53.064]  It was a lot of them.
[02:31:53.104 --> 02:31:54.004]  Hey, talk about this.
[02:31:54.564 --> 02:31:55.524]  Answer these charges.
[02:31:56.084 --> 02:32:01.085]  And then I would answer the charges, answer the charges, and always somebody else who wasn't listening when I answered them wanted me to answer the charges.
[02:32:02.583 --> 02:32:04.205]  And the whole thing was a straw man.
[02:32:04.345 --> 02:32:05.125]  That's what they do.
[02:32:05.165 --> 02:32:06.587]  They build straw men.
[02:32:06.627 --> 02:32:09.349]  They build false arguments with false data.
[02:32:09.649 --> 02:32:15.915]  They say things you didn't say, or they take them out of context, and then they go disprove the thing you never said.
[02:32:17.216 --> 02:32:23.562]  But the way to counter that is to realize this broadcast is not about Alex Jones.
[02:32:23.602 --> 02:32:25.043]  This always seems to come up in the third hour.
[02:32:26.024 --> 02:32:26.905]  It really isn't.
[02:32:27.944 --> 02:32:28.885]  We're good to go.
[02:32:28.945 --> 02:32:29.166]  I think?
[02:32:46.443 --> 02:32:47.564]  We have to expose that.
[02:32:47.604 --> 02:32:50.366]  We have to work as hard as we can on that.
[02:32:50.426 --> 02:32:52.507]  I had Michael Rivera on, what was it, yesterday?
[02:32:53.408 --> 02:33:06.898]  He was talking about how the Black Panthers were a mainstream organization in the community, and then the government intimidated them, harassed them, lied about them, and then got them to become radical and paranoid and fighting with everyone and trusting no one and neutralized them.
[02:33:07.218 --> 02:33:09.900]  The answer is just ignore it and laugh at it and move on.
[02:33:11.480 --> 02:33:19.844]  I always, you know, I've been criticized by some of the militia people, not all of them, but some, because I told people years ago, I said, I'm not going to have anything to do with the militia.
[02:33:20.705 --> 02:33:22.946]  And that's a whole other big discussion.
[02:33:23.306 --> 02:33:24.827]  Because I am the militia.
[02:33:24.887 --> 02:33:35.072]  I don't have to go join a militia under some questionable commander who likes to run around with a bunch of camo on and a general's star on his hat because he always wanted to be a general.
[02:33:35.112 --> 02:33:39.834]  And he's got an admiral because the admiral owns a pontoon boat or a bass boat.
[02:33:41.618 --> 02:33:43.058]  I mean, it's crazy.
[02:33:43.098 --> 02:33:45.059]  We've got to act in a serious fashion.
[02:33:46.880 --> 02:33:54.665]  And I know I rant and rave, but by serious fashion, when I go down to the city council, I'm wearing a suit and tie or a button-up shirt, because that's urban camo.
[02:33:54.865 --> 02:33:56.126]  I'm not wearing camouflage.
[02:33:56.166 --> 02:34:01.369]  Now, if I'm duck hunting, I'm wearing camo, and I'm out there in the reeds if I ever had time to do that anymore, which I don't.
[02:34:02.989 --> 02:34:03.790]  It's silliness.
[02:34:04.785 --> 02:34:22.474]  And so the government, she's a militia movement forming, so for every ten guys in the militia, I'd say there would have to be at least one real agent in every one, and then planting pipe bombs on people, sending everybody to prison, and then, oh, Alex, you need to come join in with us in all of this so you can go to jail too, so we can plant something on you.
[02:34:22.494 --> 02:34:24.235]  I mean, I learned real early.
[02:34:24.255 --> 02:34:30.958]  I got an education real early, because back in 98, there was an old World War II veteran, Joe Campana,
[02:34:31.923 --> 02:34:34.065]  And he'd been in World War II and the Japanese.
[02:34:34.105 --> 02:34:36.127]  He'd been involved in the atomic testing.
[02:34:36.167 --> 02:34:37.408]  He didn't even talk about it.
[02:34:37.568 --> 02:34:41.512]  We saw it in all his big box of medals and commendations.
[02:34:42.496 --> 02:34:45.980]  He owned about almost an acre right over in Hyde Park.
[02:34:47.021 --> 02:34:52.588]  Just the acre itself, this was back in 1998, was valued at around $450,000 on the tax rolls.
[02:34:53.068 --> 02:34:56.192]  And he really had full disability, but didn't even really know how to draw it.
[02:34:56.232 --> 02:35:00.637]  So he would go around town picking up cans just to pay his property taxes that were so high.
[02:35:00.677 --> 02:35:03.520]  And his roof started caving in.
[02:35:04.429 --> 02:35:15.133]  And they were going to charge him $14,000 to bulldoze the city was, the house, saying it was condemned, and then use the $14,000 he couldn't pay to take the property.
[02:35:16.733 --> 02:35:18.214]  And I was pretty naive back then.
[02:35:18.274 --> 02:35:19.754]  I mean, I still am to a certain extent.
[02:35:19.774 --> 02:35:20.194]  We all are.
[02:35:20.234 --> 02:35:21.115]  We all learn stuff every day.
[02:35:21.135 --> 02:35:23.275]  At least we should if we're actively growing.
[02:35:23.936 --> 02:35:29.357]  And Mike Hanson, who did some camera work for me at the time, he said, Alex, you see this in the paper.
[02:35:29.417 --> 02:35:30.938]  This old guy, I went by and talked to him.
[02:35:31.736 --> 02:35:33.218]  He's real nice.
[02:35:33.879 --> 02:35:35.341]  Mike had a carpentry business at the time.
[02:35:35.361 --> 02:35:38.845]  He said we ought to go fix his house for him.
[02:35:38.865 --> 02:35:41.849]  So I announced on the radio, hey, I don't take donations.
[02:35:42.770 --> 02:35:45.053]  This is the equipment, the things we need.
[02:35:45.113 --> 02:35:47.496]  After I'd gone and met Joe, he died a few years ago.
[02:35:48.445 --> 02:35:52.327]  I said, we need you to pull up with this many boards and this many types of shingles.
[02:35:52.367 --> 02:35:53.208]  We need you to be there.
[02:35:53.988 --> 02:35:54.769]  We're going to fix it.
[02:35:56.210 --> 02:35:57.010]  We tried to go get a permit.
[02:35:57.030 --> 02:35:58.271]  They said, we're not going to give you a permit.
[02:35:58.311 --> 02:35:58.871]  It's condemned.
[02:35:58.911 --> 02:36:00.712]  We said, well, we're going to fix it anyways.
[02:36:00.732 --> 02:36:04.074]  Then they came and said, we're going to arrest you if you fix it.
[02:36:04.434 --> 02:36:05.535]  We said, okay, fine.
[02:36:06.295 --> 02:36:10.838]  We're going to build him a new house on the site.
[02:36:11.784 --> 02:36:16.588]  And then we'll have to get the citizens together to demolish it for him.
[02:36:16.608 --> 02:36:18.349]  We've got a contractor saying he'll do it for free.
[02:36:18.369 --> 02:36:19.450]  We just pay for the dump fee.
[02:36:19.470 --> 02:36:26.415]  There's going to be a few thousand bucks, a little bitty house that he built himself after we got back from, I think in 1949, 1950.
[02:36:27.736 --> 02:36:29.217]  And Joe was shell-shocked.
[02:36:29.237 --> 02:36:34.721]  I wouldn't call him mentally ill or crazy, but when planes would fly over, he'd hear a backfire, he'd jump.
[02:36:35.441 --> 02:36:36.702]  I've known a lot of vets like that.
[02:36:36.742 --> 02:36:39.204]  This guy saw heavy combat, highly decorated combat.
[02:36:40.367 --> 02:36:43.730]  And had a great, all his family had died or moved away.
[02:36:43.750 --> 02:36:44.610]  He didn't have anybody.
[02:36:45.411 --> 02:36:46.651]  Nice Italian-American.
[02:36:47.292 --> 02:36:48.032]  Salt of the earth.
[02:36:48.753 --> 02:36:51.674]  And he was just a really sweet little person.
[02:36:51.714 --> 02:36:52.875]  Very sweet little person.
[02:36:54.356 --> 02:36:55.837]  And so we're out there building it.
[02:36:55.857 --> 02:37:00.720]  We built it in a city record of 14 days, fully furnished, with even a hot tub, jacuzzi, bathtub.
[02:37:01.040 --> 02:37:02.421]  That's what it turned into by the end of it.
[02:37:02.441 --> 02:37:03.742]  People just kept delivering this stuff.
[02:37:05.832 --> 02:37:11.574]  And I'm there about three days into it, and there's this guy in plain clothes, and he's walking around going, we really ought to attack the city.
[02:37:11.614 --> 02:37:12.634]  We ought to go after officials.
[02:37:13.455 --> 02:37:15.716]  And I got the willies from him, and I thought, man.
[02:37:16.316 --> 02:37:17.196]  And I went and got Mike.
[02:37:17.216 --> 02:37:18.196]  I said, get your camera ready.
[02:37:18.337 --> 02:37:19.457]  I'm going to walk with this guy.
[02:37:19.517 --> 02:37:21.918]  And Mike snuck off and got his camera ready.
[02:37:22.118 --> 02:37:27.240]  And I said, hey, let's walk on over to your car and talk more about this.
[02:37:27.500 --> 02:37:30.941]  And I had Mike walking over, and he didn't get there quite on time, so we didn't get it on tape.
[02:37:31.751 --> 02:37:33.598]  And we've gotten other stuff like this on tape before.
[02:37:33.618 --> 02:37:36.548]  A few years later at the Fortune 500 meeting they had here,
[02:37:38.464 --> 02:37:42.106]  And so I'm there, and I said, where's your car?
[02:37:42.126 --> 02:37:42.546]  And he's right here.
[02:37:42.566 --> 02:37:45.467]  And I go, you know, this car, what's in the front seat?
[02:37:45.487 --> 02:37:47.268]  You've got police equipment in there.
[02:37:47.328 --> 02:37:48.828]  You're a police officer, aren't you?
[02:37:49.049 --> 02:37:49.549]  Tell me your name.
[02:37:49.589 --> 02:37:50.209]  And Mike comes over.
[02:37:50.229 --> 02:37:51.049]  We did get his face.
[02:37:51.370 --> 02:37:53.891]  And he's like, and he gets in his car and drives off.
[02:37:53.951 --> 02:38:00.873]  I mean, why do I deserve cops trying to get me to talk about violence when I was pretty mainstream at that time?
[02:38:01.194 --> 02:38:06.916]  I mean, I was getting rid of the Federal Reserve and cut taxes, but I was nothing compared to what I am today because I hadn't learned yet.
[02:38:08.158 --> 02:38:09.039]  I hadn't learned.
[02:38:10.119 --> 02:38:11.841]  But I'd heard about provocateur.
[02:38:11.881 --> 02:38:13.081]  I'd heard about that in the 60s.
[02:38:13.101 --> 02:38:14.342]  But I realized it was happening.
[02:38:14.662 --> 02:38:25.289]  Then some local developer comes over who lived in the neighborhood and starts threatening me and starting fights the next day and trying to get everybody arguing with each other and all of this.
[02:38:25.349 --> 02:38:30.873]  And it turned out later we found he was the guy who had already tried to buy the land from Campana.
[02:38:32.554 --> 02:38:36.577]  So, I mean, this has been a growing experience for me.
[02:38:38.212 --> 02:38:45.655]  And in front of about 15 witnesses, I had a lady pull a butcher knife on me and lunge at me.
[02:38:47.416 --> 02:38:53.778]  And it got written up by witnesses when we were rebuilding the Branch Davidian Church as a memorial for those that died.
[02:38:55.239 --> 02:39:03.642]  And we're there, at first it was going to be a little bitty chapel, but my listeners got involved and it went crazy into something that seated 400 people and had a second story, and you can go out there and look at it today.
[02:39:04.344 --> 02:39:07.966]  The few Davidians that still live out there, they try to take their land about 20 times.
[02:39:07.986 --> 02:39:09.728]  I mean, a couple times a year they get sued.
[02:39:10.008 --> 02:39:19.194]  Somebody trying to take their land with government connections because they don't want that museum out there, a little museum that was already there, a little shack, and then now the big chapel or small church is what I'd call it.
[02:39:20.715 --> 02:39:27.019]  And all of this happened, and there were these weirdos that kept talking bad about me, starting fights, saying I was a fed, doing all this stuff.
[02:39:27.739 --> 02:39:32.203]  And then we're over by the museum and the lady's talking about it and I walk over to her and I go, you know, God bless you.
[02:39:32.223 --> 02:39:33.784]  There's a whole bunch of people there.
[02:39:33.804 --> 02:39:35.326]  I go, why are you so angry?
[02:39:35.366 --> 02:39:37.107]  We're just here trying to get this thing built.
[02:39:37.488 --> 02:39:41.011]  You know, working every weekend for six months and it was getting near completion.
[02:39:41.331 --> 02:39:49.118]  And she pulled out a butcher knife and lunged at me and said, I'm a federal informant and we've brought people like you down all over the country and you're going to die.
[02:39:49.318 --> 02:39:50.019]  You're dead.
[02:39:51.917 --> 02:40:01.164]  And then later, we did research on her, and we had one of the local police officers who was visiting down there from, oh, what's the town outside of Fort Worth?
[02:40:01.204 --> 02:40:01.664]  I forget.
[02:40:02.065 --> 02:40:03.125]  Who did a background check.
[02:40:03.165 --> 02:40:04.526]  Oh, those really are informants.
[02:40:04.546 --> 02:40:06.648]  Yeah, no, no, they're involved in law enforcement.
[02:40:06.908 --> 02:40:07.749]  But they're so crazy.
[02:40:07.769 --> 02:40:12.372]  You've got to have a crazy person to be out there trying to set up good people building a memorial church.
[02:40:12.892 --> 02:40:13.973]  She's just so crazy.
[02:40:13.993 --> 02:40:15.995]  She brandished a butcher knife and jabbed it at me.
[02:40:16.015 --> 02:40:16.975]  Of course, I didn't step back.
[02:40:17.035 --> 02:40:17.436]  I just said...
[02:40:17.996 --> 02:40:19.057]  You know, God bless you.
[02:40:19.537 --> 02:40:21.638]  And they literally ran off like demons.
[02:40:22.279 --> 02:40:24.140]  So these people are real.
[02:40:24.840 --> 02:40:26.081]  These people are real.
[02:40:26.361 --> 02:40:31.524]  And I went through those trials and tribulations years ago until finally, thank God, they've left me alone.
[02:40:31.564 --> 02:40:34.286]  The latest thing was the threat, I better shop about DynCorp.
[02:40:34.306 --> 02:40:35.966]  But it's been a while since I've gotten those.
[02:40:36.207 --> 02:40:39.288]  And that came through military intelligence sources, two separate ones.
[02:40:39.809 --> 02:40:40.849]  You know, I was given the word.
[02:40:42.210 --> 02:40:44.331]  So I've increased the amount we talk about it.
[02:40:44.351 --> 02:40:45.332]  Now we talk about it every day.
[02:40:46.481 --> 02:40:48.660]  Because somebody's got to stand up for these people.
[02:40:50.845 --> 02:41:05.891]  There's only a few thousand of these minions and these intimidators and these COINTELPRO specialists, so most people out there attacking and doing stuff are just nuts, or they're jealous, or they're crazy, or they've got a problem, or they think the New World Order is too big to fight, so they get in this movement and get frustrated.
[02:41:06.571 --> 02:41:09.232]  Really, what COINTELPRO does is it snowballs.
[02:41:09.492 --> 02:41:10.352]  It mockingbirds.
[02:41:10.392 --> 02:41:15.194]  You know, Operation Mockingbird, with the media, back in 77, declassified it for decades.
[02:41:15.494 --> 02:41:18.055]  The CIA, openly set up by the British out of the OSS,
[02:41:18.951 --> 02:41:26.314]  We had key reporters in TV and print who would write an article at the highest levels, and it would get picked up by others and then snowballed.
[02:41:27.174 --> 02:41:28.194]  It's like the Muslim riots.
[02:41:28.434 --> 02:41:42.879]  They provoke a turret, they release fake cartoons, neocon publications do it, the media says there's a confrontation brewing, Muslims read it and think, oh, there's a confrontation brewing, I'll show up to these meetings, and then it scares all of Europe into getting behind the Iran war.
[02:41:43.179 --> 02:41:44.640]  Same thing with the riots of November.
[02:41:45.160 --> 02:41:47.923]  So most of the people involved are not government agents.
[02:41:48.523 --> 02:41:54.269]  But most of the time, they were picked up by the snowball as it rolls down, or the rock slide.
[02:41:54.529 --> 02:41:56.191]  A pebble can cause a rock slide.
[02:41:56.211 --> 02:41:58.013]  A shout can cause a rock slide.
[02:41:58.373 --> 02:41:59.594]  Until you're aware of that.
[02:41:59.634 --> 02:42:00.195]  But frankly...
[02:42:01.096 --> 02:42:11.146]  They were very effective because our numbers were probably 1 20th or 1 30th, I'm just guessing at those numbers, back in the mid-90s of what they are now.
[02:42:11.326 --> 02:42:15.931]  Now they don't have anywhere near the personnel to do anything to anybody.
[02:42:16.191 --> 02:42:22.218]  They can kill a few of us here, frame a few of us there, but that's nothing in the final equation now.
[02:42:24.373 --> 02:42:26.035]  That's why they're announcing the wiretaps.
[02:42:26.075 --> 02:42:27.577]  That's why they're trying to intimidate you.
[02:42:27.597 --> 02:42:29.219]  That's why they're trying to do all of this now.
[02:42:29.239 --> 02:42:37.349]  They're saying, with the new Patriot Act expansion, any, quote, disruption of anything, even if a public official isn't there, starting with a year in prison is a felon.
[02:42:38.459 --> 02:42:41.303]  That's why they're trying to scare everybody not to demonstrate.
[02:42:41.503 --> 02:42:46.690]  That's why they admit that the CIA is spying on critical mass bike rides that aren't even political.
[02:42:47.291 --> 02:42:48.713]  It's to scare all of us.
[02:42:48.793 --> 02:42:49.434]  It's a bluster.
[02:42:49.514 --> 02:42:54.521]  I'm going to huff and I'm going to puff and I'm going to blow your house down!
[02:42:55.663 --> 02:42:58.624]  It's just like Ceausescu in Romania.
[02:43:00.325 --> 02:43:02.426]  Finally, one day, everybody just took the government down.
[02:43:02.686 --> 02:43:04.927]  The cops went, well, I thought everybody else was for it.
[02:43:04.947 --> 02:43:05.828]  I've always been against it.
[02:43:05.848 --> 02:43:06.368]  Well, you too?
[02:43:06.408 --> 02:43:07.048]  You're against it too?
[02:43:07.228 --> 02:43:07.969]  Yeah, I'm against it too.
[02:43:07.989 --> 02:43:08.389]  What about you?
[02:43:08.409 --> 02:43:09.409]  Well, I've always hated it.
[02:43:09.790 --> 02:43:11.691]  You know, they took my daddy away 20 years ago.
[02:43:11.731 --> 02:43:12.751]  Well, I'm sick of it too.
[02:43:12.771 --> 02:43:14.612]  Well, let's deal with it then.
[02:43:14.972 --> 02:43:15.772]  All right!
[02:43:16.493 --> 02:43:17.633]  That's how it works.
[02:43:17.833 --> 02:43:18.674]  Mark Twain said it.
[02:43:18.734 --> 02:43:19.574]  It's my favorite quote.
[02:43:19.634 --> 02:43:23.196]  In the beginning, a patriot is a scarce man, hated and feared and scorned.
[02:43:24.391 --> 02:43:25.332]  I never add that part.
[02:43:25.352 --> 02:43:27.013]  I always misquote it, but here it is.
[02:43:27.313 --> 02:43:30.815]  In the beginning, a patriot is a scarce man, hated and feared and scorned.
[02:43:31.235 --> 02:43:38.398]  But in time, when his cause succeeds, the timid join him, because then it costs nothing to be a patriot.
[02:43:39.239 --> 02:43:47.423]  I mean, do you know what it means when multiple Air America stations privately owned that picked up Air America go, you know what, I heard Alex Jones, what he's saying is true about the left-right paradigm.
[02:43:47.443 --> 02:43:49.064]  We're going to put him on in prime time.
[02:43:50.140 --> 02:43:58.104]  You know, our old line conservative stations that I was a guest on five years ago who didn't believe me, and the station owner calls up and says, the station, well, he's right.
[02:43:58.144 --> 02:44:01.446]  I've seen it all now, and it's true, and I've got family in the military that are telling me it's true.
[02:44:02.246 --> 02:44:03.447]  I'm going to put Alex Jones on.
[02:44:03.487 --> 02:44:04.427]  We know he gets ratings.
[02:44:04.908 --> 02:44:07.709]  The truth gets ratings, but we always thought it couldn't be true.
[02:44:07.729 --> 02:44:08.650]  We're going to put him on.
[02:44:09.070 --> 02:44:10.210]  You see, it's already happening.
[02:44:10.230 --> 02:44:14.993]  People are going, you know, it's all right to say it's okay not to give Prozac to two-year-olds.
[02:44:15.976 --> 02:44:21.820]  You know, it's all right to say cancer viruses are in the vaccine when it's in thousands of admitted reports and documents.
[02:44:22.221 --> 02:44:28.605]  It's okay to admit that mercury has caused 1 in 25,000 to have autism to 1 in 1,060-something.
[02:44:28.685 --> 02:44:30.226]  Or 1,600, excuse me.
[02:44:30.306 --> 02:44:35.990]  And now this year they're saying the numbers are going to come out from last year.
[02:44:36.010 --> 02:44:36.751]  It's going to be even worse.
[02:44:37.672 --> 02:44:38.052]  You know what?
[02:44:38.072 --> 02:44:39.093]  He's right about that.
[02:44:39.173 --> 02:44:39.613]  You know what?
[02:44:40.652 --> 02:44:45.816]  And I'm just as smart as Alex Jones, they say, and I'm doing my own research, and I'm going to be more eloquent and more involved.
[02:44:46.036 --> 02:44:53.622]  And when I see those individuals rise, when I see talk show hosts that don't backstab and don't fight and don't act like a bunch of lunatics, they're on this show.
[02:44:53.922 --> 02:44:54.983]  I'm promoting their books.
[02:44:55.063 --> 02:44:56.304]  I'm promoting their websites.
[02:44:56.584 --> 02:44:57.865]  Because, see, I realized something.
[02:44:57.905 --> 02:44:59.146]  I realized something very early on.
[02:45:01.548 --> 02:45:05.691]  Most people are driven by jealousy and envy when you're in a sick, decadent society.
[02:45:06.051 --> 02:45:08.253]  People who've been truly successful throughout life
[02:45:09.389 --> 02:45:09.850]  We're good to go.
[02:45:09.870 --> 02:45:10.210]  We're good to go.
[02:45:26.835 --> 02:45:28.936]  And then they see this whole movement as nothing but a business.
[02:45:29.016 --> 02:45:32.177]  Obviously it is a business and we need the funding, but that is secondary.
[02:45:32.197 --> 02:45:38.140]  It's just fuel in our info war drive-by tank, basically.
[02:45:38.680 --> 02:45:45.923]  But they see it as if we knock off all these people, if we can denigrate them and demonize them, then we can be the big...
[02:45:46.463 --> 02:45:47.043]  Hot shots.
[02:45:47.083 --> 02:45:48.684]  Folks, I don't want to be the big hot shot.
[02:45:48.784 --> 02:45:53.185]  I want people to rise who are better and more articulate than I am because that makes me safer.
[02:45:53.565 --> 02:45:54.305]  I mean, let's be frank.
[02:45:54.826 --> 02:45:57.587]  And it also energizes the movement more.
[02:45:57.627 --> 02:45:59.247]  You see, the pie grows.
[02:45:59.287 --> 02:46:00.127]  People wake up.
[02:46:00.387 --> 02:46:01.448]  We all get safer.
[02:46:01.648 --> 02:46:08.090]  And if you're just into selling books or whatever, the more people that get woken up by somebody else, the more videos that are going to be bought from me.
[02:46:08.570 --> 02:46:10.671]  I really understand, quote, the business model.
[02:46:11.151 --> 02:46:13.511]  I want to have people to collaborate with.
[02:46:14.072 --> 02:46:15.292]  I want to have friends.
[02:46:15.672 --> 02:46:17.353]  I want to have people I can work with.
[02:46:17.793 --> 02:46:21.515]  And so many of these snakes contact me and go, why won't you promote me and have me on?
[02:46:21.815 --> 02:46:22.716]  Well, let me go look.
[02:46:22.916 --> 02:46:24.576]  Well, I see all you do is attack people.
[02:46:24.636 --> 02:46:25.137]  No, thank you.
[02:46:25.177 --> 02:46:27.098]  I don't wish to traffic with you or truck with you.
[02:46:27.618 --> 02:46:28.338]  Thank you, though.
[02:46:29.199 --> 02:46:31.280]  And then they start precipitating.
[02:46:32.280 --> 02:46:35.222]  It's like the wicked witch who doesn't get invited to the party, so they get mad.
[02:46:36.382 --> 02:46:37.743]  People wonder why...
[02:46:38.797 --> 02:46:49.285]  You know, so many famous people want Alex Jones to fly out and hang out with them, or so many authors write books, or so many big national talk show hosts will have me on, because they'll still tell you.
[02:46:49.305 --> 02:46:50.005]  They've watched me.
[02:46:50.045 --> 02:46:50.605]  They've seen.
[02:46:50.926 --> 02:46:52.067]  I'm not a backstabber.
[02:46:52.727 --> 02:46:53.648]  I'm not a weirdo.
[02:46:53.708 --> 02:46:55.389]  I'm not a mentally ill individual.
[02:46:56.937 --> 02:46:59.178]  And so I'm wanting to defeat the New World Order.
[02:46:59.238 --> 02:47:15.830]  I'm not in this mode of I only have the truth and we're the chosen elite and no one else knows the real truth and everyone's bad but us and we're going to grow and everyone needs to know that we're the best and everyone needs to know that only we have the answers and everyone needs to know that all those other people are bad.
[02:47:15.850 --> 02:47:21.074]  And we have the truth about 9-11 and we have the truth about this and we have the truth about that.
[02:47:22.057 --> 02:47:24.418]  And this needs to be said.
[02:47:24.598 --> 02:47:25.738]  This is actually positive.
[02:47:25.899 --> 02:47:34.302]  What we're doing right now is just to get your thinking caps on, to get your mindset straight, to get your head screwed on straight, to realize that it's about the issues.
[02:47:34.382 --> 02:47:38.663]  It's about going, and we'll go to your calls in the final segment.
[02:47:40.804 --> 02:47:50.268]  It's about saying, why are we focusing on foreign phone calls to America and letting the whole debate be centered around that?
[02:47:51.380 --> 02:47:57.282]  Instead of all the admissions of the Pentagon spying on domestic groups with no connections to any of the CIA's al-Qaeda groups.
[02:47:58.382 --> 02:47:58.622]  Why?
[02:47:59.262 --> 02:48:00.623]  You see, that should be the debate.
[02:48:00.683 --> 02:48:05.324]  That's the debate that will get the American people moving and angry and upset, but that's only in a few newspapers.
[02:48:05.564 --> 02:48:08.985]  It's admitted, the government doesn't even deny it, but it's back of the paper.
[02:48:09.205 --> 02:48:11.726]  No, they're going to make you debate the smallest part of the issue.
[02:48:13.072 --> 02:48:13.492]  You see?
[02:48:13.913 --> 02:48:23.538]  And then they're going to keep you off issues where all you talk about is which group is the most kingly and what talk show host is the best.
[02:48:23.858 --> 02:48:27.120]  And frankly, that just keeps us from growing the movement.
[02:48:27.140 --> 02:48:28.761]  But we're so far past that now.
[02:48:29.121 --> 02:48:30.282]  That's why they're panicking.
[02:48:30.302 --> 02:48:31.202]  They're freaking out.
[02:48:31.222 --> 02:48:31.763]  They're going nuts.
[02:48:32.803 --> 02:48:33.804]  And I watch these people.
[02:48:33.844 --> 02:48:35.626]  They'll try to build some credibility for a while.
[02:48:35.646 --> 02:48:36.968]  They'll try to do some reports.
[02:48:37.028 --> 02:48:39.090]  And then as soon as they think they've got it, they'll attack.
[02:48:39.411 --> 02:48:41.092]  Then they lose all credibility instantly.
[02:48:41.112 --> 02:48:44.216]  And they wonder why we just keep exploding in size and reaching more people.
[02:48:44.396 --> 02:48:46.018]  Because people can sense the truth.
[02:48:47.259 --> 02:48:50.101]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[02:48:50.381 --> 02:48:51.081]  Hello, my friends.
[02:48:51.161 --> 02:48:51.962]  Alex Jones here.
[02:48:52.302 --> 02:48:56.965]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law, 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[02:48:57.305 --> 02:49:04.049]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[02:49:04.369 --> 02:49:06.350]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[02:49:06.551 --> 02:49:09.393]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[02:49:09.493 --> 02:49:14.156]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[02:49:14.356 --> 02:49:18.759]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[02:49:18.999 --> 02:49:26.224]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[02:49:26.484 --> 02:49:28.906]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.
[02:49:29.066 --> 02:49:30.807]  Call toll-free to get a copy of Martial Law.

[02:49:46.272 --> 02:49:48.253]  You've asked for them and now they're here.
[02:49:48.333 --> 02:49:59.038]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use for the Berkey Light's Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[02:49:59.418 --> 02:50:03.940]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Element.
[02:50:04.000 --> 02:50:15.346]  When used, water flow through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[02:50:15.926 --> 02:50:22.769]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[02:50:23.169 --> 02:50:25.310]  Your purified water is now ready.
[02:50:25.810 --> 02:50:30.772]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 post-filter elements.
[02:50:31.072 --> 02:50:38.355]  Get a set of two for only $49 or get two sets for only $89 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.

[02:50:45.538 --> 02:50:48.180]  We're good to go.
[02:51:03.391 --> 02:51:04.052]  We're good to go.
[02:51:18.942 --> 02:51:19.463]  We're good to go.
[02:51:19.483 --> 02:51:19.783]  I think?
[02:51:47.279 --> 02:51:48.620]  We're good to go.
[02:52:16.136 --> 02:52:17.158]  There's so much more.
[02:52:17.198 --> 02:52:20.104]  The Silica Stilo interview is going up next week.
[02:52:20.725 --> 02:52:23.110]  All my best audio interviews, my weekly TV show.

[02:52:39.317 --> 02:52:39.977]  Who's up next here?
[02:52:40.037 --> 02:52:41.318]  Ron in California.
[02:52:41.358 --> 02:52:41.838]  Thanks for holding.
[02:52:41.858 --> 02:52:42.318]  Go ahead, Ron.
[02:52:44.439 --> 02:52:45.039]  Great show today.
[02:52:45.380 --> 02:52:45.720]  Thank you.
[02:52:45.780 --> 02:52:46.240]  Wonderful.
[02:52:46.700 --> 02:52:48.921]  Is this the first time McKinney's been on?
[02:52:49.924 --> 02:52:54.105]  Yeah, I've interviewed her once for the TV show and a documentary.
[02:52:54.125 --> 02:52:56.386]  She's in my film Matrix of Evil, but yeah, first time on the radio.
[02:52:56.906 --> 02:52:58.586]  She's phenomenal.
[02:52:59.327 --> 02:53:08.569]  I was listening to Pacifica last night, and there was a guy talking about a meeting between the number one and number two richest guys in the world, and they were speculating that the oil was going to go to...
[02:53:09.828 --> 02:53:11.389]  $260 a barrel?
[02:53:11.929 --> 02:53:15.530]  Well, whatever's said at Bilderberg almost always happens.
[02:53:15.590 --> 02:53:30.894]  And last year, they're going to meet here in about a month and a half again, last year repeated from two different sources that have moles inside, Estelon and then, of course, Tucker, that it's going to go to $100 a barrel in the next year.
[02:53:30.914 --> 02:53:32.255]  Now, we'll see if that happens.
[02:53:32.275 --> 02:53:32.715]  They've got about
[02:53:33.436 --> 02:53:37.758]  Four or five months for that to happen, but it certainly did go up to $80 a barrel there for a while.
[02:53:37.778 --> 02:53:37.999]  Yeah.
[02:53:38.219 --> 02:53:47.364]  They said that the meeting was last week, and they said that Iran's going to change their currency to the euro.
[02:53:47.664 --> 02:53:49.705]  Yeah, their own oil trading.
[02:53:52.066 --> 02:54:02.152]  They said that Venezuela, only 6% of our oil supply, but if he gets upset at Bush and just decides to cut off his refineries to go, that it could totally just...
[02:54:02.939 --> 02:54:04.140]  I think that's a very central point.
[02:54:04.160 --> 02:54:08.102]  A lot of great articles and analysis has been written on that subject.
[02:54:08.122 --> 02:54:09.563]  Good to hear from you, Ron.
[02:54:09.583 --> 02:54:11.004]  Mike in California, you're on the air.
[02:54:11.024 --> 02:54:11.745]  Welcome.
[02:54:29.389 --> 02:54:29.829]  Hi, Alex.
[02:54:30.110 --> 02:54:30.350]  Hi.
[02:54:30.590 --> 02:54:33.091]  Hey, I'm trying to get David Stahl's website.
[02:54:33.212 --> 02:54:36.134]  Now, I know one of them is corridorwatch.org.
[02:54:36.314 --> 02:54:38.575]  Yeah, and then it's stahlforsenate.org.
[02:54:39.115 --> 02:54:41.777]  Now, can you spell the name Stahl?
[02:54:41.797 --> 02:54:45.780]  If you type it in Google, it'll spell it for you if it's misspelled.
[02:54:46.100 --> 02:54:48.241]  Okay, because my friend has been trying to get it on his computer.
[02:54:48.282 --> 02:54:48.842]  He can't get it.
[02:54:49.671 --> 02:54:55.214]  Well, a lot of sites are blocked, and we've been seeing more and more of that, or it could be down.
[02:54:55.394 --> 02:54:55.995]  I haven't looked.
[02:54:56.295 --> 02:54:58.896]  Okay, so it's stall4senate.org.
[02:54:59.176 --> 02:55:00.237]  I believe from memory, yes.
[02:55:00.317 --> 02:55:01.237]  Okay, that's what I gave him.
[02:55:01.298 --> 02:55:02.698]  I told him to type that in.
[02:55:02.898 --> 02:55:03.559]  He's been trying.
[02:55:04.019 --> 02:55:05.560]  I bet I can walk.
[02:55:05.620 --> 02:55:06.460]  I've got a computer right here.
[02:55:06.500 --> 02:55:07.241]  I bet I can.
[02:55:08.101 --> 02:55:08.622]  But go ahead.
[02:55:08.922 --> 02:55:18.227]  Okay, I was going to tell you also, there was word about your show on the George Norrie show just recently where you were part of a panel.
[02:55:19.008 --> 02:55:20.449]  Well, listen, I mean...
[02:55:44.017 --> 02:55:45.177]  Go address 20 million people?
[02:55:45.598 --> 02:55:45.798]  Yeah.
[02:55:46.538 --> 02:55:47.798]  I mean, why would I turn that down?
[02:55:47.998 --> 02:55:48.578]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:55:48.598 --> 02:55:49.419]  That's what I say, too.
[02:55:50.119 --> 02:55:51.519]  You know what George does that I like?
[02:55:51.539 --> 02:55:53.920]  He says some shows are fun and other shows are serious.
[02:55:54.140 --> 02:55:55.641]  And he'll say, this is a fun show tonight.
[02:55:55.881 --> 02:55:57.401]  When I'm on, he says this is a serious show.
[02:55:57.961 --> 02:55:59.362]  I like the direction George is going.
[02:55:59.402 --> 02:56:00.422]  He's going in the right direction.
[02:56:01.162 --> 02:56:05.484]  And I'm not going to bash him because he just doesn't turn into Alex Jones overnight.
[02:56:05.884 --> 02:56:08.425]  I think George Norrie is doing a pretty darn good job.
[02:56:08.665 --> 02:56:09.245]  Yeah, I think so, too.
[02:56:09.725 --> 02:56:13.507]  Yeah, I mean, we can just say, oh, no, let's just let them all do Ghosts and Goblins on there.
[02:56:14.048 --> 02:56:16.909]  Or, no, we're glad now that they're having a lot of serious broadcast.
[02:56:16.929 --> 02:56:19.831]  I mean, his first hour every night is usually serious to begin with.
[02:56:19.851 --> 02:56:20.712]  You know, he has the news.
[02:56:21.032 --> 02:56:21.692]  We're out of time.
[02:56:21.752 --> 02:56:22.513]  God bless you all.
[02:56:22.533 --> 02:56:23.793]  Get out there and take on the New World Order.
[02:56:25.895 --> 02:56:30.477]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[02:56:30.497 --> 02:56:30.658]  Hello.
